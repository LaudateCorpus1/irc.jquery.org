[01:30:35] <jak2000> hi all
[01:30:49] <jak2000> when a input text lost focus, wich is the event to fired?
[01:31:01] <arc_> jak2000 blur
[01:32:37] <arc_> or focusout, apparently
[01:32:51] <arc_> which is not supported by firefox
[01:43:47] <Cork> arc_, jak2000: jquery polly fills that though
[01:43:59] <Cork> so both works in all browsers if you bind it with jquery
[01:44:11] <jak2000> ok
[01:44:27] <Cork> worth noting though is that blur doesn't bubble
[01:44:28] <jak2000> i know, i asked somethimes about ENTER key but isnt clear..
[01:44:32] <jak2000> about prevent...
[01:44:40] <Cork> while focusout does
[01:45:03] <Cork> jak2000: enter is normally catched by the form
[01:45:10] <Cork> (unless for textareas)
[01:46:14] <jak2000> but i need event.prevent or something?
[01:47:12] <Cork> jak2000: to do what?
[01:49:12] <jak2000>  e.preventDefault() ?
[01:49:19] <Cork> to do what
[01:49:29] <Cork> prevent the focus from leaving the input field?
[01:50:00] <Cork> prevent the form from submitting?
[01:50:03] <Cork> or...?
[01:50:42] <jak2000> when the user hit ENTER key
[01:50:43] <jak2000> ?
[01:51:01] <Cork> ok, that is WHEN, and you want to do what?
[01:52:44] <jak2000> i have 3 inputs, the focus is on the first.... when user hit ENTER i want move to second input, again hit ENter and move the focus to third, here in this input when user hit ENTER, i want save the data and move to first input
[01:53:08] <Cork> jak2000: ok, the solution is to bind the submit event on the form
[01:53:19] <Cork> when the user hits enter check document.activeElement
[01:53:24] <Cork> and find the next field from that
[01:53:44] <Cork> blur is fired when the field are changing focus, not on key press
[01:56:26] <jak2000> making a fiddle
[01:59:15] <jak2000> same as here: http://jsfiddle.net/Jaganathan/6AWkH/2/?
[02:01:30] <Cork> jak2000: 1. never use return false in event handlers
[02:01:44] <Cork> it kills the events and makes the page close to impossible to extend without rewriting
[02:01:59] <Cork> use event.preventDefault() instead
[02:02:19] <Cork> also is this what you're looking for? https://jsfiddle.net/hhp1r8La/
[02:02:45] <Cork> jak2000: thirdly, i would strongly recommend NOT using enter to move between fields
[02:03:00] <Cork> the web standard is that enter submits forms and that is what user expects
[02:03:03] <arc_> what do you mean by extend
[02:03:09] <Cork> so using enter to move between fields are bad ux
[02:03:18] <Cork> arc_: adding more functionality
[02:03:43] <Cork> the event handlers added after your handler isn't ever executed so they can't process the event
[02:03:53] <Cork> they have to modify your code to be able to access the event
[02:03:54] <arc_> oh you just mean you'd have to change return false to preventdefault
[02:04:00] <Cork> well ya
[02:04:04] <Cork> but that isn't what i meant
[02:04:14] <arc_> lol ok well what do you mean by rewriting then
[02:04:18] <Cork> i meant they have to add there code to your event handler cause no other event handler can execute
[02:04:33] <jak2000> Cork yes
[02:04:41] <jak2000> why the user not understand not use ENTER key?
[02:04:45] <Cork> and that means they have to mix old and new code and that makes it harder to maintain
[02:05:05] <Cork> jak2000: like i said, in all normal forms enter submits it
[02:05:16] <Cork> and it is suppose to submit it
[02:05:16] <arc_> we haven't used enter to move between fields since like, 1985
[02:05:23] <Cork> ya
[02:05:27] <jak2000> :(
[02:05:47] <Cork> jak2000: another way to do almost the same thing (but it an acceptable way)
[02:05:54] <Cork> is to on submit validate the different fields
[02:05:59] <Cork> and focus the invalid field
[02:06:22] <Cork> that would almost give the exact same behavior, but without breaking user expectations
[02:06:57] <Cork> but it an => but in an
[02:07:55] <jak2000> you recommend me use a validator form?
[02:08:14] <Cork> well, that is an option
[02:08:28] <Cork> validation by "hand" isn't that hard either though
[02:08:39] <Cork> so what ever you prefer
[02:08:50] <jak2000> https://jqueryvalidation.org/
[02:08:53] <jak2000> its ok?
[02:09:01] <Cork> its a very common plugin ya
[02:09:49] <jak2000> by hand.....
[02:09:54] <jak2000> is hard not/
[02:10:36] <Cork> if($('#address').val() == '') { event.preventDefault(); $('#address').focus(); status("address can't be empty") }
[02:10:49] <Cork> half psudo code but that is about the complexity of it
[02:12:34] <jak2000> yes understood
[04:01:16] <Duikb00t> o/
[04:31:52] <warden23> Hello ignore the fact that the .select script doesn't work as it does on my site. But if you click a button, see it fades and then snapes to the middle. Atm just the 00 to 09 button does. But how do I make it move to that position smoothly rather then snapping to place? https://jsfiddle.net/csw6wy6j/
[04:32:10] <warden23> I'm using: $("#matrix-menu a").not(".selected").fadeToggle( "slow", "linear");
[04:33:01] <warden23> Which fades it how I want.. but I want it so the .selected moves slowly to the position where it goes (because the other #matrix-menu a.. links disappear).. if that makes sense?
[04:44:20] <warden23> Trying this.. but not working? https://jsfiddle.net/csw6wy6j/1/
[04:45:52] <warden23> Sorry I meant this: https://jsfiddle.net/csw6wy6j/2/
[04:46:40] <warden23> You'll soon see why that fails.. lol.. my goal is to get .selected to sit nicely next to 'Random text'
[04:47:01] <warden23> Then when I click the button it goes back to position and all the menu is displayed?
[04:47:57] <farodi> Hi all
[04:49:02] <farodi> Hi all, how can I learn jquery from a book ?
[04:49:12] <warden23> Find the book and read it ;)
[04:50:38] <farodi> Ok
[04:51:10] <warden23> I'm just being silly, just find some youtube videos and they will get you to follow from the youtube video and then you can follow the same principles from a book. :)
[04:51:52] <farodi> Thanks warden23
[04:51:57] <warden23> np
[04:57:10] <farodi> Warden23 can I add you ?
[04:57:38] <warden23> No point buddy I don't know that much I'm here for help also.. I just knew that answer lol
[04:58:39] <farodi> Okey
[04:59:56] <farodi> warden23: thanks
[05:11:12] <AdamPDotty> So there are videos about how to read a book?
[05:13:08] <cmrabet> Hi all
[05:13:37] <cmrabet> Which plugin you recommend for sorting and paginating repeated HTML structures?
[07:33:24] <Duikb00t> hi some people lazyloading plugin here?
[07:33:29] <Duikb00t> I want to lazy load when my items are inview
[07:33:40] <Duikb00t> But it seems only to be working on resize and onscroll ?
[07:34:40] <Duikb00t> That's the only case my image is being - loaded -
[07:38:36] <Cork> Duikb00t: what other reason would cause an image to come into view?
[07:39:14] <Duikb00t> scroll and 'swipe'
[07:39:16] <Duikb00t> sorry
[07:39:18] <Duikb00t> arrows and swipe
[07:39:27] <Duikb00t> it's a table presentation im workin gon
[07:39:38] <Cork> well those doesn't cause events in the page
[07:39:55] <Duikb00t> So, lazyload won't be triggered right?
[07:39:55] <Cork> so you would have to manually inform that those could cause new images to get into view
[07:40:04] <Cork> depends on how the code are written
[07:40:16] <Duikb00t> Am I allowed sending you a preview link in a DM?
[07:40:19] <Duikb00t> PM*
[07:40:28] <Cork> i don't have time
[07:40:31] <Duikb00t> ok
[07:41:01] <Duikb00t> <li><div class="cd-slider-content"><div class="content-wrapper"><img data-original="img/events/1.jpg" alt="Event" class="img-responsive lazy"></div></div></li> :   currently this is what I am doing
[07:41:15] <Duikb00t> Where I just active 'lazyload; plugin
[07:41:49] <Duikb00t> I tried to add the add lazyload on the window but that doesn't change anything.
[07:54:23] <Cork> Duikb00t: you most likely have to read the plugin
[07:54:33] <Cork> it most likely bind the resize and scroll event
[07:54:54] <Cork> you will have to find that function it calls and call it from your own events
[07:55:50] <Duikb00t> well I tried
[07:55:51] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/dntkwx/
[07:55:52] <Duikb00t> this
[07:56:00] <Duikb00t> oh
[07:56:12] <Duikb00t> when I  use that and I scroll the image appears so
[07:56:14] <Duikb00t> that corrcet
[07:57:42] <Duikb00t> When I write it like this: https://www.pastery.net/fuyvbj/  I have to 'resize' the window and the image is succesfully loading.
[07:57:45] <Cork> Duikb00t: are you sure that is the correct command?
[07:57:56] <Duikb00t> Check the latest paste plz ;)
[07:57:59] <Cork> i would guess at that for binding that they should be lazy
[07:58:35] <Cork> also that only runs on page load
[07:58:40] <Cork> not on swipe and so on
[07:59:05] <Duikb00t> That's my question how can I 'couple' that lazyload(); plugin to a swipe event?
[07:59:17] <Duikb00t> blah.addEventListeren('swipe', functoin ( ... ?
[07:59:20] <Cork> that is what i answered 4 mins ago...
[07:59:21] <Duikb00t> ( in dummy code )
[07:59:44] <Duikb00t> Well yes, but I don't know how to do that :P
[08:02:32] <Duikb00t> $(window).on("swipe",function(){ this is doing wierd things :D
[08:03:35] <Duikb00t> it shows only if I swipe back :P
[08:08:07] <sarah_> Hey- I have a question about maps/filters...
[08:08:32] <sarah_> I have a json object called jsonObj
[08:09:02] <sarah_> why cant i get this to fire off?
[08:09:09] <sarah_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1965506f226af3340b62d231dd983485
[08:21:12] <Cork> sarah_: $.map(jsonObj, function(person) {})
[08:21:28] <Cork> sarah_: .map only works on jquery objects, and those are only meant for elements
[08:23:36] <decx> well that's just map
[08:24:22] <decx> you want filter btw
[08:24:31] <decx> also depends on what's in jsonObj
[08:24:39] <Cork> well $.grep
[08:24:44] <Cork> filter is also just for elements
[08:25:03] <decx> native filter and map of course
[08:25:12] <decx> why do dyou think index isnt the first argument
[08:25:14] <Cork> but those only works on arrays
[08:25:24] <decx> that's why i'm asking what's in jsonObj
[08:25:44] <Cork> well i would take Obj to be... well
[08:25:48] <Cork> but ya you have a point
[08:32:51] <sarah_> Cork: i have an object with 600+ arrays within it. each is structured like this: Contact.FirstName : "Bob" Contact.LastName : "Saget" ContactId : 2946
[08:33:13] <Cork> uh, that is not json
[08:33:26] <sarah_> I want to be able to search jsonObj via fname and/or Lname
[08:33:59] <Cork> did you mean you had an array of 600+ objects?
[08:34:03] <sarah_> yes sir
[08:34:09] <Cork> ok that makes a bit more sense
[08:34:55] <Cork> and by Contact.FirstName: do you mean { Contact: { FirstName: "bob" } } or { "Contact.FirstName": "bob" }?
[08:35:12] <sarah_> the latter
[08:35:18] <Cork> wow... ok
[08:35:23] <sarah_> the example i showed is actually a copy and paste
[08:35:30] <sarah_> wow... like bad wow ?
[08:35:38] <Cork> like weird wow
[08:36:36] <Cork> ok that would give you an $.grep(jsonObj, function(person) { return person["Contact.ContactId"] == 9415; })
[08:36:38] <sarah_> that is weird? I feel like it is logical. one giant array, and each array within it contains a customers data. How else should it be structured?
[08:36:43] <Cork> or something like that
[08:37:03] <Cork> sarah_: you normally don't build nesting structures inside the key name
[08:37:07] <sarah_> Okay so look into using grep
[08:38:25] <Cork> sarah_: to debug the loop you can use console.log(person) it should help you get the structure correct
[08:39:10] <decx> dots in the key huh, i too like to live dangerously
[08:39:22] <sarah_> thats how the data was served to me
[08:39:51] <decx> yeah we all get terrible data sometimes ^^
[08:40:23] <Cork> ya, i remembered when i was served an api that returned broken tagsoup
[08:40:28] <sarah_> I use a crm called infusionsoft tand thats how there schema was is structured, I was concerned about that as well
[08:40:36] <Cork> that i then should script modify and store in a database...
[08:40:38] <Cork> was lovely...
[08:40:45] <decx> blimey
[08:40:46] <Cork> tidy ftw
[08:41:22] <sarah_> cork: okay then I will look into that- thanks
[08:41:39] <Cork> sarah_: sorry tidy is for html, you don't need it
[08:41:58] <decx> i assume "look into grep"
[08:42:04] <Cork> ah
[08:42:08] <sarah_> yes
[08:42:23] <Cork> was afraid i sent you on a while goose chase XD
[08:42:34] <decx> so is grep just a polyfilled filter?
[08:42:38] <decx> in $
[08:42:43] <Cork> json => tidy => head ace
[08:43:08] <Cork> decx: no i think it is a reimplementation
[08:43:21] <Cork> decx: with jit it becomes little speed difference
[08:44:02] <Cork> decx: grep, filter, not, map, each are all basically the same function in jquery
[08:44:06] <decx> it assume it's even faster
[08:44:08] <decx> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=grep
[08:44:08] <Cork> and it all uses a for loop
[08:44:10] <decx> just a loop
[08:44:49] <Cork> decx: we Array.prototype.filter is a loop too
[08:44:56] <Cork> the difference is that it is written in c
[08:45:04] <decx> of course
[08:45:06] <Cork> so you tend to get more context switches in the browser
[08:45:14] <Cork> so it might be slower cause of that
[08:45:15] <decx> but it always inits a new object for every iteration doesnt it
[08:45:23] <decx> or something
[08:45:29] <Cork> no
[08:45:49] <Cork> it references the original member of the array
[08:46:00] <Cork> it always returns a new array with all the results though
[08:46:05] <Cork> same for jquery
[08:46:24] <Cork> (except jquery sometimes returns an object)
[08:47:52] <sarah_> should I flatten my array?
[08:48:14] <Cork> from what you said it shouldn't be multi dimentional
[08:48:37] <Cork> array != object
[08:49:08] <sarah_> The items within the array are an object
[08:49:18] <Cork> sarah_: if you need parsing help it would make life much simpler if you could make an example json dump of the structure
[08:49:35] <Cork> a jsfiddle.net would be nice
[08:50:41] <decx> just 6 objects instead of 600 will suffice tho
[08:50:51] <sarah_> ok i will make a fiddle
[08:50:55] <Cork> well two would be enough
[08:53:26] <Ty_> Are you not able to dynamically generate an animated gif?
[08:53:55] <Cork> Ty_: no there isn't anything in html or js to generate gif98
[08:54:02] <Cork> heck there isn't even anything for reading them
[08:54:30] <Ty_> Well maybe I worded that wrong
[08:54:51] <Ty_> I am using a tweet-fetcher plug in that pulls my recent tweets and I want it to show images
[08:55:28] <Ty_> I have it set with show images and they get generated as a background image (all works) but if it's an animated gif, it doesn't render the image, but still shows a box for said image
[08:57:00] <sarah_> https://jsfiddle.net/xr8otzc3/
[08:57:21] <sarah_> uhmmmm..... yeah right.... sorry about that....
[08:59:51] <Ty_> Cork: I have an example if that will help explain it better :)
[09:03:38] <samaris> hi
[09:03:57] <samaris> anyone in here i am totally new to IRC
[09:04:08] <Cork> Ty_: what is rendering the image?
[09:04:09] <sarah_> I am here!
[09:04:21] <Cork> samaris: => #freenode they will help you
[09:04:54] <samaris> i have an issue with my jquery mobile app i have moved from Pages do not load after moving QueryMobile from jquery 1.6.4 / jquery mobile 1.2.1 through to jquery 1.9.1 and jquerymobile 1.3.2
[09:04:58] <Cork> sarah_: i need the json, not what ever that is
[09:05:31] <Cork> samaris: ask the question and ppl will answer if they know the answer
[09:05:44] <samaris> do i ask it in this room
[09:05:49] <Cork> yes
[09:06:00] <Cork> though jqm isn't as wildly used as plain jqm
[09:06:01] <Cork> opps
[09:06:04] <Cork> plain jq
[09:06:13] <Cork> so you might have to reask it for a while
[09:06:18] <samaris> I have a working jquerymobile app that i have just migrated to a later version of jquery and jquery mobile code. I have addressed the change relating to ".live" changing to  ".ON" doing so has allowed my home screen to load as per normal however when i link to any of the other pages the pages header / footer load correctly yet there is no contact. If i revert the jquery references on the index.html page back to ver. 1.6 / 1.2 all t
[09:06:27] <Cork> shorter lines
[09:06:32] <Cork> much shorter :)
[09:06:36] <Cork> this is irc not email
[09:06:57] <samaris> ok
[09:07:15] <Ty_> Cork: if you take a look at this example, you can see that it pulls my tweets and on line 326, you will see my conditional to bring in the images |  http://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/NrPzZg?editors=0010
[09:07:36] <Ty_> But if you look at the first tweet loaded, you see that it fails to load an animated gif
[09:08:10] <samaris> i have just change my jquery mobile and juery files from jquery 1.6.4 and jquery mobile 1.2.1 to jquery 1.9.1 and jquery mobile 1.3.2
[09:08:45] <samaris> however having done so none of the content any any page other than my index.html page dispalys only the headers and footers dispaly
[09:09:01] <sarah_> I think I need this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12462318/find-a-value-in-an-array-of-objects-in-javascript
[09:09:29] <Cork> sarah_: donno until you share a usable json example
[09:10:18] <sarah_> well the data that I supplied you with is how it is currently structured. Are you saying I messed this all up and need to look at my data before i changed it
[09:10:21] <Cork> it should look something like [{ "Contact.FirstName":"Bob", "Contact.lastName": "something" }, { "Contact.FirstName":"Bob", "Contact.lastName": "something" }]
[09:10:25] <sarah_> oh
[09:10:29] <Cork> sarah_: that wasn't data
[09:10:57] <sarah_> yes, I have that.... but i thought it was messed up because there are quotes around  it making it into one giant string
[09:11:01] <sarah_> but ill show you that
[09:11:23] <Cork> sarah_: that is prob cause the server isn't setting the correct content-type
[09:11:23] <taplar> i like how the FirstName doesn't match the lastName camelcase
[09:11:35] <Cork> so js takes it as text/html instead of json
[09:11:43] <samaris> Cork did my shorter comments make sense
[09:11:57] <Cork> samaris: i don't know jqm enough to help you
[09:12:11] <Cork> samaris: the reason i commented on the first version was cause it was cut off
[09:12:27] <samaris> thanks can u point me into the right direction as to qhere i may be able to get the assistance
[09:12:44] <Cork> samaris: you are in the only irc place i know for those questions
[09:12:57] <samaris> ok thanks
[09:12:57] <Cork> the problem is there isn't so many jqm guys hanging around
[09:13:11] <decx> if you get lucky arschmitz is there
[09:13:14] <Cork> (i don't want anything to do with it personally)
[09:13:31] <samaris> ANYONE in the room with solid JqueryMobile experience ???
[09:13:57] <Cork> samaris: i would suggest trying again in about 3h
[09:14:07] <Cork> then the us gets active and you might have a bit of luck there
[09:14:17] <samaris> cork thanks thats 3am my time
[09:14:24] <Cork> :)
[09:14:26] <Cork> ya
[09:14:32] <samaris> cork is there a greater number of users in theroom then
[09:14:40] <Ty_> Hey Taplar, figured out my issue yesterday
[09:14:42] <Cork> no not normally
[09:14:45] <Cork> just different users
[09:14:47] <taplar> oh?
[09:15:09] <sarah_> so this is how it is originally structured: https://jsfiddle.net/r3nouu00/ . As you can see it is a giant string within in array. so what i did to 'alleviate' the situation was do this after:
[09:15:15] <sarah_> strippedData = ajaxResult[0].substring(1, ajaxResult[0].length-1);
[09:15:17] <Ty_> With the click opening images as a document
[09:15:20] <sarah_> jsonObj = $.parseJSON('[' + strippedData + ']');
[09:15:44] <Cork> sarah_: that doesn't look completely correct
[09:16:03] <sarah_> story of my life
[09:16:04] <Cork> sarah_: have a look in the browsers network tab and grab the raw data stream for the json
[09:16:17] <Cork> that has the best chance of getting a clean source
[09:16:54] <Cork> currently you get ["[{" and that looks horribly bad
[09:17:35] <Cork> sarah_: btw is the api public?
[09:17:38] <sarah_> well under network it just says : [Object, Object, Object, Object, over and over and over again]
[09:17:48] <Cork> if it is the best solution might be to just link it
[09:18:05] <Cork> sarah_: check the response tab
[09:18:05] <sarah_> The documentation? https://developer.infusionsoft.com/docs/xml-rpc/#data-query-a-data-table
[09:18:51] <Cork> that serves xml though
[09:20:06] <sarah_> iim using php, and it says: "Returns  Returns an array of objects, one per result found by the query. The object will contain all fields specified by the selected fields along with their corresponding values."
[09:44:09] <sarah_> cork: this worked for me I think
[09:44:11] <sarah_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12462318/find-a-value-in-an-array-of-objects-in-javascript
[09:44:38] <sarah_> btw how do I make it so I actuallt ping someone ?
[09:48:12] <sarah_> See ya later.... JOBIN!
[09:49:26] <taplar_busy> o_O
[09:50:29] <RenokK> On jQuery UIs "sortable", is there a way to display every placeholder once dragging is started?
[09:58:48] <BillCriswell> RenokK: There should be a CSS class applied to the sortable container once dragging is started. Should be able to work with that maybe?
[10:00:56] <BillCriswell> s/CSS class/class/
[10:00:57] <b-ot> Correction, <BillCriswell> RenokK: There should be a class applied to the sortable container once dragging is started. Should be able to work with that maybe?
[10:01:10] <BillCriswell> Damn. Getting fancy pants in here.
[10:03:40] <RenokK> BillCriswell: That's not helping the way i intend to use it. I added the "placeholder" option. Giving is a simple "ui--sortable-placeholder" Class. But UI only places it, where my sortable if hovering. I would like it to be placed on every spot I can drop it, so that it's easier to see.
[10:08:29] <BillCriswell> RenokK: Hmm...
[10:08:46] <z1haze_work> does anyone know if using the jQuery.validator can you add elements to be validated based on the input type rather than the class?
[10:10:46] <z1haze_work> The way my job has forms, we dont actually have the ability to write the code for the input itself, we wrap it in a custom template kinda thing and it spits out the row, and input etc
[10:11:09] <RenokK> BillCriswell: Just as explanation on what i meant, since my english isn't the best today :D  If you look at the placeholder example you can see what I mean. It only displays the placeholder under the object. Once dragging I would like every placeholder to appear. http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#placeholder
[10:11:48] <BillCriswell> Right right. Not sure there's an option for that but thinking about how to fake it.
[10:13:36] <RenokK> Yeah, i think i will just create my own placeholders, listening to on drag start to display them, giving them the size of the element i started dragging. Atleast thats the only solution i can think of right now.
[10:25:23] <BillCriswell> @RenokK But that's going to be not very fun.
[10:25:25] <BillCriswell> bet*
[10:27:45] <RenokK> BillCriswell: Not fun, but working. Or I'll just scrap that whole idea because it will make the entire content jump around once dragging is started, due to more content being added. And the more i think about it, the uglier i think this will be.
[10:28:02] <BillCriswell> RenokK: Agreed completely.
[10:28:12] <BillCriswell> That'll eat up a lot of space quickly.
[10:30:35] <RenokK> BillCriswell: Yup, idea scrapped. But thanks for your help.
[10:30:42] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:34:53] <sarah_> Hello, I am using array filter and it is working, but I have a problem with entries that are the same: http://jsfiddle.net/gJPHw/553/
[10:35:10] <sarah_> how can I collect the first 3 events and not just the 1st one here?
[10:37:41] <taplar_busy> array.filter(....)[0]
[10:37:49] <taplar_busy> ^ that's what your doing
[10:38:34] <sarah_> phhh
[10:38:42] <sarah_> that was foolish
[10:38:52] <sarah_> thx
[10:42:55] <z1haze_work> anyone use jQuery.validator and can answer some questions for me? When adding custom methods does the name have to reference a class or can you make it reference an input type specificaly
[10:48:20] <hellyeah> taplar_busy:  i start learning angularJS
[10:50:30] <taplar_busy> cool
[10:51:42] <hellyeah> and i think working with jquery help me to speed up process of learning angularJS
[10:52:57] <Uhkis> i've heard the exact opposite
[10:54:53] <taplar_busy> i could see that, if by using jquery you become more acquainted with javascript in general
[10:56:15] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  it is just my sense
[10:56:27] <hellyeah> i am really newbie on angular
[10:56:36] <hellyeah> i also know javascript
[10:56:48] <hellyeah> but you can use jquery with angular right
[10:57:05] <taplar_busy> angular has a small subset of jquery like methods in it
[10:57:10] <taplar_busy> jqlite i believe it's called
[10:57:30] <taplar_busy> but yeah, nothing stops you from using full blown jquery with angular
[10:57:56] <taplar_busy> though, from my perspective, your probably better trying to just shift your whole paradigm and go all in on angular
[10:58:03] <taplar_busy> then if you must, fill in gaps with jquery
[10:59:03] <The_Photographer> what is better angular 2 or jquery?
[10:59:12] <taplar_busy> they serve different purposes
[10:59:16] <taplar_busy> apples and oranges
[10:59:16] <hellyeah> angular2 is beta
[10:59:27] <hellyeah> angular is for data binding
[10:59:38] <taplar_busy> angular is an entire framework
[10:59:42] <hellyeah> and there are some features but i dont know yet
[10:59:53] <hellyeah> jquery is just javascript nothing more
[10:59:57] <hellyeah> am i correct?
[10:59:59] <taplar_busy> so is angular dude
[11:00:07] <taplar_busy> its framework vs library
[11:00:21] <hellyeah> can we say
[11:00:33] <hellyeah> jquery function is just wrapper of js equivalence?
[11:00:44] <taplar_busy> the goal of angular is to make the development of your whole front end easier, MVC, MV*, whatever.  it does it
[11:00:46] <dariolap> Hi all, how selector i must pass to find to check both input and select? https://github.com/1000hz/bootstrap-validator/blob/63c41af6eaad8f7162364dc3a541b450a7f695a0/docs/dist/validator.js#L24
[11:00:57] <hellyeah> mvvm
[11:00:59] <taplar_busy> jquery's goal is to standardize dom interactions
[11:01:14] <taplar_busy> standardize/generalize
[11:01:20] <taplar_busy> afk
[11:01:21] <hellyeah> i need to go right now
[11:02:35] <BillCriswell> @dariolap That selector should get input, textarea and select (and maybe others, would need to read the docs).
[11:02:39] <z1haze_work> whats the difference between self and this?
[11:02:58] <dariolap> BillCriswell, i can't get select with plugin selectize
[11:03:07] <z1haze_work> self references the parent this?
[11:03:20] <BillCriswell> z1haze_work: Depends what it's assigned to.
[11:03:22] <dariolap> if i pass only "select", it works correctly only for select
[11:03:34] <BillCriswell> Somewhere in the code there's `var self = something`.
[11:03:48] <BillCriswell> Where as this is always available.
[11:04:44] <z1haze_work> ah gotcha, just a common practice then?
[11:04:47] <BillCriswell> dariolap: If you want just inputs and select then "input,select" would do the trick.
[11:05:00] <BillCriswell> z1haze_work: Exactly. It can be literally anything.
[11:05:09] <z1haze_work> cool, i get it
[11:05:31] <dariolap> BillCriswell, i tried but not works with multiple select
[11:05:59] <z1haze_work> i export a module to my main app file but theres part i dont understand: http://dpaste.com/3E8KNRC i an curious what you think initForm is diong without knowing too much detail about what happens above
[11:07:30] <BillCriswell> Setting up a form for validation it looks like.. I might be misunderstanding the question.
[11:08:12] <BillCriswell> dariolap: Need more details than that. "input,select" will definitely select all input and select elements, what you're doing with the collection later is a total mystery to me.
[11:09:05] <z1haze_work> i dont dont know what the initForm is doing.. the init method above seems to be setting up validation
[11:09:19] <z1haze_work> i just dont know**
[11:11:01] <samaris> Hi Anyone with sold JQ
[11:11:10] <samaris> UERY MOBILE experience in the room ???
[11:11:35] <dariolap> BillCriswell, This is how my plugin (selectize) transform html select https://gist.github.com/dario86/1acf6a419c16180c685805c91ace96d8
[11:11:42] <samaris> Anyone with solid JqueryMobile experience in the room ??
[11:12:27] <BillCriswell> z1haze_work: It does seem repetitive.
[11:13:15] <z1haze_work> and where would (f) be coming from
[11:14:22] <BillCriswell> It seems like something is calling it like `validator.initForm(formElement)`.
[11:17:47] <z1haze_work> yea except there isnt anywhere in the project lol
[11:17:57] <z1haze_work> i just started working at this job so i didnt write any of this
[11:18:02] <z1haze_work> so hard to come into the midle of stuff
[11:49:31] <z1haze_work> anyone know what these parameters would be for jquery.validator ? $.validator.messages.required = function($1, ele, $3) { ...
[11:52:45] <sliter> I can't use $('button').click inside .js file?
[11:52:50] <sliter> Or problem is in me?
[11:54:43] <z1haze_work> sure you can
[11:54:54] <z1haze_work> if you have jquery
[11:55:33] <sliter> I do.
[11:55:34] <sliter> I guess.
[11:55:53] <sliter> $ works in console
[11:55:54] <sliter> So
[11:56:07] <sliter> Why i can use $ from html but not .js?
[11:56:12] <sliter> Any ideaS?
[11:58:01] <taplar_busy> console.log($) when you trying to use it and see what you get
[11:58:43] <sliter> Explanation of function.
[11:59:11] <taplar_busy> it's writing to the console what '$' is
[11:59:31] <taplar_busy> are you familiar with the browser console?
[12:02:23] <sliter> Sort of.
[12:03:32] <taplar_busy> i get a feeling this might be informative to you then: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:04:41] <sliter> There is no errors.
[12:04:44] <sliter> Absolutely.
[12:13:55] <Ty_> Can you extract video Urls from tweets within the twitter widget?
[12:19:04] <joaocastanho> Hi. Is it bad to use jQuery/AJAX all over your website?
[12:23:09] <AdamPDotty> yeah, put it in an extra file :-)
[12:23:41] <joaocastanho> but I mean performance, etc
[12:23:51] <Ty_> joaocastanho: It can be, you'll want to split it off your HTML file and into other JS files, but be aware the more script calls you have, the slower your webpages can load
[12:24:49] <joaocastanho> really?
[12:24:59] <AdamPDotty> yep, more requests
[12:25:01] <joaocastanho> I'm going to use AJAX, and I'm going to call it few times
[12:25:10] <joaocastanho> 1 per page
[12:25:13] <AdamPDotty> but one file is just fine and will usually get cached
[12:25:28] <Ty_> 1 call per page won't kill your site
[12:25:42] <Ty_> it sounded like you were looking to make 15-20 script calls a page lol
[12:26:05] <Ty_> you should be fine, just keep it in a seperate JS file and not in <script> tags in your HTML
[12:27:30] <joaocastanho> 1 file per page?
[12:28:01] <joaocastanho> 15-20 is enourmous though
[12:36:23] <taplar_busy> it really depends
[12:36:39] <taplar_busy> if 15-20 happen within a minute time, that's fairly large
[12:36:54] <taplar_busy> but if your a spa, your probably going to be doing various ajax requests over time
[12:37:29] <taplar_busy> but response time and response size are also factors
[12:44:51] <User9812> Hello. I am attempting to create a toggle for showing and hiding the full version of some text. I am following a script shown on Stack Overflow. But though I can see the script working on JSFiddle.net, I cannot get the code to work locally on my computer.
[12:44:53] <User9812> My Code: http://pastebin.com/0P1rU8Ru === Stack Overflow Link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5270227/how-to-hide-show-more-text-within-a-certain-length-like-youtube === JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/hea09ec4/
[12:46:19] <User9812> I tried using inline CSS and JavaScript and linked CSS and JavaScript. To simplify the process of showing you, I shared the inline copy on PasteBin.
[12:46:50] <taplar_lunch> your binding before the elements exist in the dom
[12:47:20] <taplar_lunch> either put your logic in a doc ready or put your logic at the bottom of the body tag
[12:48:01] <User9812> taplar_lunch: Sorry, but I'm not sure what you mean by "put your logic in a doc ready."
[12:48:49] <User9812> I think "doc" means "document" and "logic" means "the jQuery script" but I'm not sure how I could put the script in a "doc ready."
[12:49:01] <taplar_lunch> ok, so when your browser loads your page it essentially parses it from top to bottom
[12:49:21] <taplar_lunch> meaning if a script is above the tags that it needs, they will not exist yet
[12:49:43] <taplar_lunch> a document ready ( $(function(){ /* logic here */ }) ;
[12:49:58] <taplar_lunch> delays the execution of your logic until the entire page is parsed into the dom
[12:50:26] <taplar_lunch> otherwise you can stick your script at the bottom of your body, and all your html will have been parsed and loaded at that point
[12:50:42] <User9812> Okay, so I think you are saying that I need to put the link to the jQuery script below the HTML?
[12:51:02] <taplar_lunch> any logic that does $(selector) is looking from elements in the dom
[12:51:19] <taplar_lunch> this must be ran either after the html that creates those, or inside a document ready
[12:51:26] <taplar_lunch> or it will not find them as they don't exist yet
[12:52:04] <taplar_lunch> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[12:52:30] <User9812> taplar_lunch: Yes! Putting the jQuery script below the HTML content worked perfectly!
[12:52:32] <User9812> Thanks!
[12:53:23] <sarah_> anyone ever use something called http://kiro.me/projects/fuse.html fuse.js for a 'fuzy' search
[12:55:21] <User9812> taplar_lunch: Also, I appreciate your thorough explanation about why the jQuery script needs to be put under the HTML. I will take a look at your link too.
[12:56:16] <Ty_> Hey Taplar, figured out why that code wasn't working, still trying to get a fix though
[12:56:18] <User9812> Bye for now.
[12:56:31] <taplar_lunch> Ty_: cool
[12:57:03] <Ty_> turns out it doesn't extract MP4 URLs the same way as image ones :c
[12:57:17] <taplar_lunch> heh, why am i not surprised, ;)
[12:57:46] <Ty_> any idea how I could extract an mp4, looking around, can't really find anything
[12:58:09] <taplar_lunch> no clue.  never messed with twitter api before
[12:58:18] <taplar_lunch> or mp4s for that matter
[12:58:43] <taplar_lunch> are you asking how to get the url or how to create the tag to make it visible?
[12:58:52] <Ty_> get the url
[12:58:58] <taplar_lunch> yeah, no clue
[12:59:01] <Ty_> i'm not using the api, this is using the widget
[12:59:32] <Ty_> since I didn't want to have to explain to my whole team how to use oAuth, i opted for the widget way
[13:06:24] <taplar_lunch> looks like robert is living up his vacation
[13:08:17] <joaocastanho> I want to validate my form with html5 first and then submit via ajax
[13:08:18] <joaocastanho> how?
[13:09:23] <taplar_lunch> which of those things is your particular question about?
[13:10:18] <joaocastanho> Okay, I have a form and I want to submit it and html5 validation will occur first
[13:10:30] <joaocastanho> after everything is filled in I submit via ajax
[13:11:37] <taplar_lunch> right.  i'm pretty sure html validation, if available, will stop the form from submitting unless it passes the validation.  so which are you having an issue with?  the validation or the ajax?
[13:12:26] <joaocastanho> okay, It's validation.
[13:12:31] <joaocastanho> I'm calling BlockUI
[13:12:45] <joaocastanho> After clicking submit button and validation doesn't occur.
[13:13:31] <taplar_lunch> so the submit is happening?
[13:13:47] <taplar_lunch> the event that is
[13:16:10] <taplar_lunch> holy crap
[13:16:20] <taplar_lunch> that's a large plugin just for an overlay...
[13:16:40] <joaocastanho> submit happens
[13:16:55] <joaocastanho> Is BlockUI too bad?
[13:16:56] <joaocastanho> xD
[13:17:05] <taplar_lunch> so sounds like you have an issue with your validation.  i'd probably hit up #html and make sure your markup is good
[13:17:26] <taplar_lunch> maybe BlockUI is doing something for you that isn't easy, but personally if all your after is an overlay, i'd do that myself
[13:18:45] <joaocastanho> current code taplar_lunch http://kopy.io/C3str
[13:19:03] <taplar_lunch> no, your misunderstanding me
[13:19:12] <taplar_lunch> if the submit is happening, then your html validation didn't stop it
[13:19:19] <taplar_lunch> meaning something is wrong there
[13:19:28] <taplar_lunch> it's not a js problem (yet)
[13:20:03] <taplar_lunch> wait, your doing validate()
[13:20:13] <taplar_lunch> are you using a validation plugin?
[13:20:26] <joaocastanho> no
[13:20:45] <joaocastanho> I did that because blockUI was called right after I clicked submit
[13:20:52] <joaocastanho> and did not wait for me to fill in required fields
[13:21:01] <taplar_lunch> there is no default validate() method in jQuery
[13:21:08] <taplar_lunch> there are plugins that add that
[13:21:24] <taplar_lunch> such as https://jqueryvalidation.org/
[13:21:33] <taplar_lunch> but that isn't "html5" validation
[13:21:40] <joaocastanho> okay. I dont need it, just need html5 validation working
[13:21:49] <taplar_lunch> html5 validation isn't javascript dude
[13:21:53] <taplar_lunch> it's browser implementation
[13:22:32] <taplar_lunch> like this stuff: http://www.pageresource.com/html5/input-validation-tutorial/
[13:22:35] <joaocastanho> but maybe it could be javascript's fault?
[13:22:42] <taplar_lunch> lol, hit up #html dude
[13:23:03] <joaocastanho> html5 validation working taplar
[13:23:14] <joaocastanho> it's just that it calls blockUI right after clicking submit
[13:23:17] <jamiejackson> hi folks. jquery validate question: i'm adding a button to clear the value of an <input type="file"/> i've got the clearing part down, but i'm not sure how to trigger validation of (just that) field.
[13:23:56] <jamiejackson> i had this,  but it's wrong. (it seems to validate the whole form):
[13:24:07] <jamiejackson> var $form = $attachFieldElem.closest('form'); var validator = $attachFieldElem.closest('form').validate(); validator.element($attachFieldElem);
[13:25:28] <taplar_lunch> joaocastanho: checkout this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/18rf7xuq/
[13:25:41] <taplar_lunch> open your console, don't enter anything, and click submit
[13:25:41] <jamiejackson> btw, i need to re-validate it to clear the validation message if the file field hadn't passed validation originally.
[13:25:46] <taplar_lunch> do you see the text in the console
[13:25:47] <taplar_lunch> ?
[13:26:06] <joaocastanho> thats how I need it to work
[13:26:15] <taplar_lunch> so you don't see text?
[13:26:41] <joaocastanho> Well, I submit dont see anything, I enter something submit and it does console log
[13:26:41] <joaocastanho> ;)
[13:26:49] <taplar_lunch> THAT is html validation
[13:26:53] <taplar_lunch> the event didn't happen
[13:26:56] <joaocastanho> so my problem is the call on the button
[13:27:03] <taplar_lunch> your event is happening, so your html validation markup is janky
[13:28:54] <taplar_lunch> jamiejackson: i'm not intimately familiar with that plugin.  have you checked out the docs?
[13:29:20] <joaocastanho> taplar_lunch I have it like you do
[13:29:25] <joaocastanho> required
[13:29:32] <jamiejackson> taplar_lunch: this is what i saw: https://jqueryvalidation.org/Validator.element/
[13:29:47] <jamiejackson> which you'll see looks very similar to my attempted solution
[13:30:09] <jamiejackson> but it seems to validate the whole form, unless i'm misinterpreting what i'm seeing
[13:30:29] <joaocastanho> now it works damn good taplar_lunch
[13:30:36] <joaocastanho> thanks a lot for your time and patience
[13:30:40] <taplar_lunch> ok, so the doc example shows it giving it a selector.  your giving it a jquery object.  i'd think they'd make it be interchangable, but you might try changing it to give a selector
[13:30:48] <taplar_lunch> joaocastanho: what was it?
[13:30:59] <joaocastanho> I was calling the event on button
[13:31:04] <taplar_lunch> :P
[13:31:05] <joaocastanho> it was supposed to be on the form
[13:31:20] <joaocastanho> f.... stupid mistake
[13:31:53] <joaocastanho> but one thing, how would you block the page like BlockUI?
[13:32:13] <taplar_lunch> are you familiar with css position and z-index?
[13:32:39] <joaocastanho> hmm sort of yeah, not pro though
[13:33:08] <taplar_lunch> ok, so what you can do is give a div or something a width and height of the whole window (100vw, 100vh)
[13:33:34] <taplar_lunch> then you position it fixed at left:0, top:0 and set the z-index to like 1000 or something large
[13:33:47] <taplar_lunch> what this does is places the div over the entire page and on top of everything
[13:33:57] <taplar_lunch> since its fixed position doesn't matter if they scroll
[13:34:05] <joaocastanho> vw and vh isn't accepted in every browsers
[13:34:06] <taplar_lunch> and if they click, they're clicking your overlay, not the page
[13:34:13] <taplar_lunch> ok, 100% then
[13:34:17] <joaocastanho> okay
[13:34:48] <taplar_lunch> then once you have that, it's just a matter of having it hidden by default, and then show it when you need it
[13:34:55] <joaocastanho> BlockUI blocks reload too
[13:35:06] <taplar_lunch> F5?
[13:35:16] <joaocastanho> yeah
[13:35:24] <taplar_lunch> what about clicking the reload button on the browser?
[13:35:37] <joaocastanho> it works
[13:35:54] <taplar_lunch> i was going to say, i'd be very surprised if they could block that
[13:36:00] <joaocastanho> yeah xD
[13:36:41] <joaocastanho> one thing, Is there any style I could use to make it look nicer?
[13:36:42] <joaocastanho> ehehe
[13:36:55] <taplar_lunch> the overlay that blockui does?
[13:37:11] <joaocastanho> yeah, but I'll do it myself like you said, it will increase performance too right?
[13:37:26] <taplar_lunch> diy would definately be smaller
[13:37:52] <joaocastanho> yeah, this plugin has 620 in the unminified version
[13:38:37] <taplar_lunch> but even if you stuck with it, yeah, you should be able to inspect the overlay and see any id or classes on it to base your styles on
[13:39:16] <joaocastanho> yeah, I was thinking you had something nice for it xD
[13:39:34] <taplar_lunch> nah, it's all up to your creativity at that point
[13:39:53] <taplar_lunch> i personally do an overlay with some transparency and a font-awesome spinner
[13:40:43] <joaocastanho> yeah, I did put an font-awesome spinner too :)
[13:42:30] <joaocastanho> well, thanks taplar
[13:42:44] <taplar_lunch> sure
[13:43:40] <joaocastanho> sorry to interrupt again, if I want to speed up jQuery/AJAX, is there anything I could do?
[13:44:26] <taplar_lunch> not really, other than reducing the work done on the backend and decreasing the size of your response payload
[13:44:42] <taplar_lunch> your at the whims of the users network at that point
[13:45:16] <taplar_lunch> oh, and gziping responses if possible
[13:45:33] <taplar_lunch> if your returning static stuff the server will most likely do that for you already
[13:45:41] <taplar_lunch> but dynamic stuff most likely isn't by default
[13:46:30] <joaocastanho> okay. I'll take a look into that. Thanks again :)
[14:00:51] <lordjancso> hi
[14:01:03] <lordjancso> whats the problem with this 4 lines of code? i'm so confused...
[14:01:04] <lordjancso> var form = $('<form>');
[14:01:04] <lordjancso>                 form.attr('action', '/ok');
[14:01:04] <lordjancso>                 form.attr('method', 'post');
[14:01:04] <lordjancso>                 form.submit();
[14:05:16] <taplar_busy> looks fine syntactically, though it's strange your doing a post with no input
[14:05:54] <taplar_busy> what is the issue?
[14:14:23] <fancyfetus> Hey guys, I have a form with a bunch of checkboxes and radioboxes. I'm trying to use jquery to check if any of them have been checked.
[14:14:28] <fancyfetus> Everything I find online seems to only apply to either checkboxes or radio buttons, not both at the same time.
[14:14:33] <fancyfetus> To clarify, my form will only contain checkboxes and radio buttons.
[14:15:10] <taplar_busy> lets see...
[14:15:44] <taplar_busy> small note, radio's should always be checked
[14:16:11] <fancyfetus> Oh wait, I think I got it. I had a bug in my code
[14:16:18] <fancyfetus> taplar_busy: hmmm
[14:16:59] <fancyfetus> I have a weird usecase right now. Let's say I have multiple services to sell and each one has a bunch of checkboxes that can configure it
[14:17:01] <taplar_busy> since there is no way to 'uncheck' all radios once one is checked, typically you have one preselected/available that is a 'no selection' one
[14:17:04] <fancyfetus> and radio buttons as well
[14:17:36] <fancyfetus> If none of the fields within the service are checked, then the service is not selected.
[14:17:58] <fancyfetus> So I need to change the service to selected if any of the fields within it are selected.
[14:18:28] <taplar_busy> what are you changing to say a service is selected?
[14:18:49] <taplar_busy> some hidden field or somethign?
[14:19:21] <fancyfetus> taplar_busy: nothing yet. I'm just applying some different styling right now.
[14:20:15] <fancyfetus> but yeah, ultimately I'll have a hidden field somewhere that gets submitted with the form.
[14:20:19] <taplar_busy> well conceptually you'd have a change event handler bound to the checkboxes/radio buttons, and when they change you'd evaluate what your setting should be set to whatever
[14:20:33] <taplar_busy> which you'd need to do that contextually to each service
[14:21:37] <taplar_busy> though i might question why you need that hidden field.  you already have your checkboxes/radios
[14:27:41] <samaris> hi
[14:28:31] <samaris> ANYONE in the room with strong JqueryMobile experience ????'
[14:33:19] <AwkwardCough> You should ask your question, if anyone is experienced with the subject they will try to help.
[14:35:49] <fancyfetus> taplar_busy: How would I then deselect all the checkboxes and radio buttons? I know you said that radio buttons should always be checked
[14:35:54] <fancyfetus> But let's overlook that
[14:36:27] <taplar_busy> you can do prop( 'checked', false );
[14:37:13] <fancyfetus> thank you :)
[14:40:58] <Bored> hi is it possible use jquery ui resizable both vertical and horizanl but only from bottom and right border?
[14:42:36] <sillyslux> there's $( ".selector" ).resizable({handles: "n, e, s, w"}); (from the docs)
[14:45:42] <Bored> sillyslux ty very much :)
[14:51:37] <DarkChaoz> hey guys needs some advice, I want to make a real time looking for group tool for my upcoming fansite, would ajax be ideal to use and can it handle large traffic?
[14:51:56] <DarkChaoz> I would go with node.js but I dont know how to make such a feature on that
[14:52:27] <taplar_busy> ideal would be websocket
[14:52:37] <taplar_busy> but without that, ajax is fine
[14:55:40] <fancyfetus> How come if I remove the checked property from a checkbox within a form, it doesn't trigger the "change" event?
[14:56:49] <taplar_busy> your doing it logically.  it's not a user action
[14:57:18] <fancyfetus> darn, any suggestions on how to get around it?
[14:57:31] <Uhkis> use trigger() after
[14:57:35] <taplar_busy> ^^
[14:57:38] <taplar_busy> ^^^
[14:57:48] <fancyfetus> trigger after what?
[14:57:59] <fancyfetus> prop('checked', false).trigger()?
[14:58:01] <taplar_busy> $element.trigger('change')
[14:58:12] <fancyfetus> oh I see
[14:58:40] <fancyfetus> worked like a charm :D
[14:58:56] <fancyfetus> okay one last question
[14:59:19] <fancyfetus> I have an onclick on an element that is within another element that has its own onclick
[14:59:29] <fancyfetus> how do I make clicking on the inner one, not trigger a click on the outer one?
[14:59:33] <taplar_busy> onclick="" or on('click', ...) ?
[15:00:05] <fancyfetus> I still want the outer element to behave as it does, with clicking
[15:00:18] <taplar_busy> and what your looking for is to cancel the inner events propagation
[15:00:26] <fancyfetus> yeah
[15:00:47] <taplar_busy> pass in the event, if your not to the handler, and do event.stopPropagation()
[15:01:36] <fancyfetus> thank you!
[15:15:05] <Ty_> can I restrict a console log?
[15:15:25] <Ty_> As in, if I cant load an image, instead of telling me 404, I just hide it
[15:15:43] <taplar_busy> uh, don't believe so
[15:16:02] <taplar_busy> that's the browser, not javascript
[15:16:19] <taplar_busy> and the majority of your users are not going to be looking at their console anyway
[15:17:41] <Ty_> yeah, i just don't wanna see a bunch of 404 errors
[15:17:53] <Ty_> I found something online on how to toggle thme, that should be good
[15:32:16] <_TWG_> how could i add a class to the parent div around an input on focus and when it has content in the field
[15:33:24] <taplar_busy> bind on the input event and do your evaluation
[15:34:24] <_TWG_> okay so $('').bind('focus', function(){}); ?
[15:34:39] <taplar_busy> $().on('input', function(){});
[15:35:10] <taplar_busy> $().on('focus input', function(){});
[15:35:31] <_TWG_> Okay and then would I do $(this).parent().addClass(); to add a class to the div wrapper?
[15:35:44] <taplar_busy> sure, if it is a direct parent
[15:46:38] <sarah_> Hello, How come this works: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8fc840e701c4039b51a9a89536b5ff1b ? Why can I do an array push here but I cant just do a variable assignment?
[15:47:29] <taplar_busy> you can do a variable assignment
[15:48:35] <sarah_> are you sure? most stuff I read online said I need a callback because it is asynchronous ?
[15:48:45] <_TWG_> taplar what am I doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/hbdmg1mk/
[15:48:58] <taplar_busy> you 'can'.  doesn't mean you 'should' ;)
[15:49:28] <sarah_> I mean... It doesn't work though
[15:49:39] <taplar_busy> show what you were trying
[15:49:41] <taplar_busy> pls
[15:50:42] <sarah_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1c0019dc2e2f2f64eff86d75066b6eb6
[15:50:43] <taplar_busy> _TWG_: https://jsfiddle.net/hbdmg1mk/1/
[15:50:46] <taplar_busy> works fine
[15:50:53] <taplar_busy> though you don't need the 'div' in parent()
[15:51:53] <taplar_busy> sarah_: the php line aside, yeah, that assignment should be fine
[15:52:18] <sarah_> it doesn't work
[15:52:27] <taplar_busy> why do you say that?
[15:52:47] <sarah_> wait
[15:52:50] <_TWG_> taplar_busy: Okay.  I guess on input is not exactly what I need.  I have a label overlayed on top of my input.  When you click in the input I need the class to be applied so the label will slide up
[15:52:51] <sarah_> let me see
[15:53:18] <taplar_busy> _TWG_: use siblings('label') instead of parent
[15:54:07] <_TWG_> The class goes to the div not the label.  I changed it from on input to on focus and it works now. taplar_busy, thanks for the help.
[15:54:12] <sarah_> Well it works... which is weird because it didn't work before and I googled like 20 sites and they said I can't do it
[15:54:29] <taplar_busy> sarah_: you can do that.  the issue is with the async nature
[15:55:13] <taplar_busy> if there is logic that follows that depends on that being set as the result, there is no guarentee doing it that way that it will have been set
[15:55:26] <taplar_busy> which is why you do callbacks for those cases
[15:55:31] <taplar_busy> and in general with ajax
[15:56:55] <poptart_> what causes this error? Uncaught TypeError: $(...).hide is not a function(…)
[15:57:29] <taplar_busy> maybe $ isn't jquery
[15:57:38] <sarah_> well this is strange
[15:57:43] <taplar_busy> console.log(jQuery.fn.hide)
[15:57:49] <sarah_> taplar_busy: thanks then
[15:58:06] <sarah_> do you just type the username like that ^ to make it ping?
[15:58:32] <poptart_> taplar: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined(…)
[15:58:44] <taplar_busy> you don't have to have the :, just some ircs auto complete with it
[15:58:53] <taplar_busy> poptart_: so you don't have jQuery at that point in time
[15:59:33] <poptart_> taplar: ok thanks
[16:00:18] <_TWG_> Okay, I have one more question taplar_busy.  I thought I was doing this part correct to check the length of the input and remove the class if it's empty but evidently not.  https://jsfiddle.net/hbdmg1mk/3/
[16:01:36] <_TWG_> Dang.  I forgot to get the .val() then the .length
[16:01:43] <_TWG_> nevermind taplar_busy
[16:01:54] <taplar_busy> so you want the class to be there for focus, or, if the input has content
[16:02:40] <_TWG_> yes but I have it working now.
[16:02:57] <_TWG_> taplar_busy: https://jsfiddle.net/hbdmg1mk/4/
[16:03:11] <Ty_> Am I missing something on this append function? http://pastebin.com/4L26uHUT
[16:03:21] <taplar_busy> _TWG_: one sec
[16:04:25] <taplar_busy> https://jsfiddle.net/hbdmg1mk/5/
[16:04:47] <taplar_busy> Ty_: doesn't look like it
[16:05:18] <Ty_> Can you append into a div that is filled with dynamic content?
[16:05:33] <Ty_> cause it doesn't want to append it lol
[16:05:49] <taplar_busy> sure, so long as it's already in the dom, since your doing a lookup
[16:06:19] <Ty_> Yup, config is static, but that is where the tweets get loaded in
[16:10:40] <trick2g> i'm making a 2d game. this is my creature function:https://jsfiddle.net/2meoxxpr/
[16:10:44] <trick2g> does anyone know how i can search through the creatures array and look for a match for the x and y values?
[16:11:04] <_TWG_> thanks for the help taplar_busy
[16:11:14] <taplar_busy> np
[16:11:37] <taplar_busy> trick2g: google Arrays.prototype.filter
[16:11:58] <taplar_busy> prefer MDN search results
[16:12:21] <trick2g> can  Arrays.prototype.filter filter by 2 values though?
[16:12:34] <taplar_busy> yup
[16:12:46] <taplar_busy> you give it a method to do the comparison
[16:12:49] <Ty_> You could also try something like this:  myArray.find(x=> x.id === '45')
[16:12:56] <taplar_busy> you can do whatever you can dream of in that guy, :)
[16:14:49] <Ty_> no idea why this append isn't working. lol jquery hates me today
[16:15:11] <taplar_busy> log the length of the selector to make sure it's finding that
[16:15:53] <Ty_> me or trick?
[16:16:00] <taplar_busy> you
[16:16:21] <taplar_busy> though in trick2g's case i just noticed that in that fiddle, at least, he's using an object, not an array
[16:16:29] <Ty_> I can see whats in the div fine
[16:16:38] <Ty_> it's just not appending to it
[16:16:57] <taplar_busy> just to rule it out, you've logged the length right before you do that append and it's 1?
[16:17:16] <Ty_> the div is empty until tweets are fetched | then those tweets are added in a ul
[16:18:53] <thebope> Hello is there any good way to bind to when the height of an element changes?
[16:19:05] <taplar_busy> resize
[16:19:07] <trick2g> taplar_busy: should i use an underscore function then like _.findWhere?
[16:19:10] <thebope> Unfortunately .resize doesn't appear to be detecting changes to "body"
[16:19:24] <taplar_busy> it's not a class, if you used the '.'
[16:19:27] <thebope> taplar_busy: I've been trying that... but to no avail for some reason
[16:19:59] <taplar_busy> $(window).on('resize', function(){ .. });
[16:20:01] <Ty_> console.log("#config").length;  returns just "#config" in console.
[16:20:17] <taplar_busy> right, cause your not doing the selector
[16:20:34] <taplar_busy> console.log($('#config').length)
[16:20:53] <Ty_> ah shit, got it. 1 sec
[16:21:19] <thebope> taplar_busy: Unfortunately it's not on window resize I want
[16:21:30] <taplar_busy> trick2g: _ is a completely different framework
[16:21:35] <thebope> I'd like to be able to do $(document).resize... I'll try .on instead
[16:21:47] <taplar_busy> part of your issue is your putting the elements in an object, not an array
[16:22:14] <taplar_busy> thebope: you said body, typically unless your doing something weird resize of window is resize of body
[16:22:20] <Ty_> Okay, I log "1" before my tweet fetch function, then log "1" after the tweet fetch function
[16:22:37] <thebope> taplar_busy: window is size of viewport... I want document heihgt
[16:22:45] <sillyslux> thebope, for document.body.resize you have to be creative http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[16:23:04] <taplar_busy> oh, so your trying to check if the body gets more stuff added to it?
[16:23:15] <thebope> thanks sillyslux
[16:23:19] <thebope> yea taplar_busy
[16:23:19] <sillyslux> i've used that for an iframe too
[16:23:34] <taplar_busy> i'd be curious if that actually fires a resize event
[16:23:38] <thebope> Apparently there's some DomSubtreeModified but it's deprecated
[16:23:42] <sillyslux> settimeout 250ms :/
[16:23:55] <taplar_busy> yeah, your kinda after Observer stuff, which isn't super supported yet
[16:24:05] <thebope> such a pain
[16:24:14] <thebope> Oh shoot, hmm I have an idea
[16:24:17] <thebope> I shall see
[16:24:23] <sillyslux> say
[16:24:30] <taplar_busy> Ty_: tweet function?  did you put it right before that append?
[16:24:36] <sillyslux> tell, wanna know :)
[16:24:45] <trick2g> taplar_busy: there's no irc channel for _ though
[16:24:52] <thebope> Well maybe I can figure out where the elements are being added
[16:24:57] <taplar_busy> underscorejs ?
[16:24:58] <thebope> and just call my function form there
[16:25:04] <trick2g> yes
[16:25:06] <thebope> ain't super sophisticated haha ;-)
[16:25:20] <taplar_busy> huh, that's kinda odd
[16:25:34] <Ty_> Yup, I had 1 at beginning and 1 at end of my doc
[16:25:43] <taplar_busy> ok, so append should be working
[16:26:11] <taplar_busy> you could try console.log($('#config').html());
[16:26:18] <taplar_busy> right after you append and you should see it
[16:26:59] <taplar_busy> trick2g: reiterating my statement, you realize creatures is not an array, right?
[16:27:08] <trick2g> it's an object i know.
[16:27:31] <taplar_busy> k
[16:28:00] <trick2g> var findCreature = _.findWhere(creature,{x:gx,y:gy}); i'm trying to do something like this with underscore.
[16:28:52] <Ty_> okay, so it's in the html, but how can I actually put it in the div? if that makes sense?
[16:29:09] <taplar_busy> it doesn't, :P  it's already in that element as a div
[16:29:44] <Ty_> Nope, only appears if I log, doesn't actually show on page
[16:29:48] <Ty_> really odd stuff
[16:29:50] <taplar_busy> ok, do this
[16:29:57] <taplar_busy> give that div your creating an id
[16:30:18] <taplar_busy> then when the page has reached a point where it should be there, look it up in your console
[16:30:54] <taplar_busy> my suspicion is that something is removing it
[16:31:54] <Ty_> No dice :/     https://jsfiddle.net/opbpqLtf/1/
[16:32:14] <Ty_> config's length always logs '1' aswell
[16:33:03] <taplar_busy> no, don't put that log in your markup
[16:33:09] <taplar_busy> the lookup of the div
[16:33:17] <taplar_busy> do that in your browser console after the fact
[16:34:46] <taplar_busy> actually i saw the config logging at the top, :s  so if you did do it in your browser console, disregard that
[16:34:47] <Ty_> ah, well it returns null     Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null
[16:35:00] <taplar_busy> hmm
[16:35:03] <Ty_> jesus haha
[16:35:16] <taplar_busy> what about just $('#seemore') in your browser console
[16:35:31] <Ty_> null
[16:35:38] <sillyslux> Ty_ what are you doing?
[16:35:51] <Ty_> but if you put this log in  console.log($('#config').html());
[16:35:55] <sillyslux> just add "See more tweets" to the end?
[16:35:58] <Ty_> it will see the appended div
[16:36:04] <taplar_busy> where are you doing this?  on jsfiddle or on your actual site?
[16:36:29] <Ty_> sillyslux: yeah, trying to append this div into a container that holds a bunch of dynamic <li>'s
[16:36:41] <Ty_> fiddle atm
[16:36:50] <taplar_busy> yeah, you can't do that with fiddle
[16:36:56] <taplar_busy> you have to do it on the real site
[16:36:57] <sillyslux> var row_str = $("<div id='seemore'>See more tweets</div>");$("#config").append(row_str); in js console does it
[16:37:05] <Ty_> https://jsfiddle.net/opbpqLtf/2/
[16:37:28] <Ty_> Can't append via fiddle?
[16:37:31] <trick2g> https://jsfiddle.net/2meoxxpr/ so can anyone tell me how i'd search for creature matching an x and y value?
[16:37:42] <taplar_busy> no, you can't do browser console commands against fiddles
[16:37:47] <taplar_busy> which is what i'm trying to get you to do
[16:37:52] <sillyslux> before tweets are shown i see "See more tweets" for a sec
[16:37:55] <Ty_> ohh i got ya
[16:38:01] <sillyslux> it get's removed i guess
[16:38:17] <Ty_> sillyslux I think it gets replaced
[16:38:34] <sillyslux> yep replaced... meant that
[16:38:36] <taplar_busy> i'm sure
[16:38:52] <taplar_busy> is handleTweets what is putting the stuff on the page?
[16:39:59] <taplar_busy> https://jsfiddle.net/opbpqLtf/3/
[16:40:29] <taplar_busy> ln 51 you were setting the innerHTML.  that's a complete replace
[16:40:30] <Ty_> twitterFetcher.fetch(config); is what prints them
[16:41:33] <Ty_> taplar_busy: ah, yeah this is me hacking into a colleagues plug in to try and make it more user friendly for other colleagues
[16:41:37] <Ty_> did not see that one
[16:42:45] <sillyslux> actually.. i'd just wrap that twitterFetcher div up in another div
[16:43:15] <sillyslux> and put "See more tweets" alongside
[16:43:19] <Ty_> sillyslux: are you talking about "#config"?
[16:43:32] <sillyslux> yes, and #outer
[16:43:50] <sillyslux> #outer -> #config, #seemore
[16:43:56] <Ty_> I have the tweets shown in a scrollable box and want them to be the last line :s
[16:43:57] <trick2g> taplar_busy: any help with what i'm trying to do?
[16:44:25] <taplar_busy> trick2g: i was looking at it, but it occured to me that your not doing any jQuery in that fiddle
[16:44:35] <taplar_busy> you might want to checkout #javascript
[16:44:56] <trick2g> it's a socket.io project
[16:44:58] <taplar_busy> sorry, ##javascript
[16:45:11] <taplar_busy> regardless, all that is vanilla js
[16:46:09] <taplar_busy> cause my initial thought is to keep your object for quick lookups, but also have an array for your filters.  but ##javascript might have other ideas
[16:48:08] <Ty_> just saw your fiddle tap, is there a way to get it to show on the bottom? as in the last thing appended to the div?
[16:48:55] <taplar_busy> uh, you could swap it up.  change += html to = html + element.innerHTML
[16:49:14] <taplar_busy> but what sillyslux was saying earlier might be cleaner
[16:49:24] <taplar_busy> especially if your going to potentially do any refreshes of it
[16:50:10] <Ty_> Ok, so I should create a container, then hold `config` and `seemore` in it?
[16:50:26] <taplar_busy> i would suggest that too, yeah
[16:50:53] <hartleyDev> Hey Guys/Gals, is it best practice to put the params on ajax success function even if not used. example success: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR)
[16:51:08] <taplar_busy> nah, just put what you use
[16:51:29] <poptart_> taplar: jquery seems to work when selecting $("#bodyCell");  but $("bodyCell").hide(); produces an error?
[16:51:40] <taplar_busy> bodyCell isn't a tag name
[16:52:02] <taplar_busy> 'tagName', '#id', '.className'
[16:52:05] <taplar_busy> just like css
[16:52:15] <hartleyDev> thanks taplar_busy
[16:52:24] <taplar_busy> sure
[16:52:48] <Ty_> now looking at it, that is probably the better solution
[16:52:51] <Ty_> less JS to handle
[16:52:55] <taplar_busy> ;)
[16:53:01] <taplar_busy> always a good thing
[16:53:14] <Ty_> thanks guys @sillyslux / @taplar
[16:53:27] <Ty_> this whole project is an animal haha
[16:53:34] <poptart_> taplar_busy: i meant $("#bodyCell").hide(); doesn't work sorry
[16:54:07] <sillyslux> how about https://jsfiddle.net/opbpqLtf/4/
[16:55:18] <andromedian> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GqpdZm how I can make this work with mouseleave as well?
[16:55:43] <poptart_> taplar_busy: so it seems jquery is loaded but I can't figure out why the error is happening
[16:56:22] <sillyslux> Ty_ https://jsfiddle.net/opbpqLtf/4/
[16:57:13] <taplar_busy> poptart_: i thought we said earlier that jQuery wasn't loaded
[16:57:46] <taplar_busy> andromedian: that exact same handler?
[16:58:09] <andromedian> I really don't know what's the best solution taplar_busy
[16:58:18] <poptart_> when i ran your code it says no but when i use this to select $("#bodyCell"); it selects the correct element
[16:58:38] <poptart_> it just wont let me call hide on it for some reason
[16:58:48] <taplar_busy> you can bind to multiple events with a given binding by giving it the multiple events, ex. 'click submit'
[16:59:20] <taplar_busy> poptart_: right before that call do this: console.log($)
[16:59:35] <andromedian> can you give an example I'm not that good yet in jquery? Thanks
[17:00:07] <taplar_busy> $('body').on('click submit', function(){ console.log( 'Hey!  you clicked, or submitted, me!' ); });
[17:00:11] <poptart_> taplar_busy: function $(selector, [startNode]) { [Command Line API] }
[17:00:13] <Ty_> sillyslux: I just took the easy way and made an html container, works for me haha
[17:00:41] <taplar_busy> poptart_: and if you change the '$' in the log to be 'jQuery'?
[17:00:54] <andromedian> thanks taplar_busy
[17:01:18] <poptart_> taplar_busy: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[17:01:35] <taplar_busy> yeah, you don't have jQuery loaded at that point.  $ is set as some other library
[17:01:44] <poptart_> hmmm
[17:01:50] <taplar_busy> your jquery include has to appear before any script that tries to use it
[17:01:50] <poptart_> thanks for your help
[17:02:44] <fancyfetus> Is there a way to modify the submit behaviour of a radio button?
[17:02:50] <fancyfetus> Instead of submitting which button is pressed in the group, I want to submit it as if each radio button is a checkbox.
[17:03:04] <taplar_busy> that doesn't make sense....
[17:03:16] <fancyfetus> yeah, you're right :/
[17:03:18] <taplar_busy> "a radio button is a checkbox"
[17:03:35] <fancyfetus> hang on, let me think and then ask a better question.
[17:03:42] <taplar_busy> np
[17:04:10] <Ty_> well i'm out of here guys, have a good day all
[17:04:16] <taplar_busy> u2
[17:05:11] <fancyfetus> I'm just looking at my encoded form output and it's like 0 -> "on", 1 -> "off", <radio-group name> -> "3"
[17:05:25] <fancyfetus> Where the left side is the name of the field and the right side is the value.
[17:05:38] <taplar_busy> yeah, that's weird
[17:06:00] <taplar_busy> oh
[17:06:14] <taplar_busy> i take it "on" and "off" are radio values?
[17:06:22] <fancyfetus> on and off are checkbox values
[17:06:28] <taplar_busy> ah
[17:06:29] <fancyfetus> The third one is a radio
[17:06:44] <fancyfetus> Basically in the backend radio buttons and checkboxes are meaningless. It's only a radio button to set some arbitrary constraint
[17:07:06] <taplar_busy> it's slightly strange that you have a checkbox for on and off.  that's more of a radio thing
[17:07:07] <fancyfetus> I don't want <radio-group name> I just want which ones are selected and which aren't.
[17:07:23] <fancyfetus> taplar_busy: I don't actually :P It was only an example
[17:07:40] <taplar_busy> lol, trying to confuse me.  i c...
[17:07:54] <fancyfetus> haha, I'm sorry!
[17:08:20] <fancyfetus> so is there any other way to handle the submission of radio buttons?
[17:09:05] <fancyfetus> Instead of <name of group> -> <selected value> perhapse I could get [<id> -> <on or off>, <id> -> <on or off>, ...]
[17:09:14] <taplar_busy> i guess i'm confused by your question.  radio groups all have the same name with different values, and when they submit you get "name": "the selected value"
[17:11:03] <fancyfetus> Its hard to explain
[17:11:13] <taplar_busy> it seems like your trying to treat radios like checkboxes
[17:11:28] <taplar_busy> but radios are not off or on
[17:11:33] <taplar_busy> they are a representation of state
[17:12:30] <taplar_busy> checkboxes are kinda like that, but checkboxes are more like booleans.  radios are like enums
[17:15:30] <fancyfetus> Yeah
[17:15:38] <fancyfetus> Maybe I should look for another way
[17:15:58] <taplar_busy> what is the issue your trying to solve?
[17:16:17] <fancyfetus> My form configures a product
[17:16:25] <fancyfetus> it has a series of categories, each containing either a set of checkboxes, or a set of radio buttons.
[17:16:46] <fancyfetus> Each checkbox or radio-button maps to a single purchasable item, it's just that some categories can only have one item selected.
[17:16:57] <fancyfetus> Each item has a unique id, which I use as the "name" for checkboxes.
[17:17:07] <fancyfetus> That means when I submit the form, I see <checkbox unique id> -> true/false
[17:17:30] <fancyfetus> which is good.
[17:17:30] <taplar_busy> so for checkbox id="whatever" and name="whatever"
[17:17:37] <fancyfetus> yeah
[17:17:40] <taplar_busy> that's fine
[17:17:47] <fancyfetus> But for radio buttons, because the name's must be the same, I cannot use the item's unique ids and I have to use
[17:18:05] <fancyfetus> something different which is not known by the backend
[17:18:36] <taplar_busy> the name is not known by the backend?
[17:19:04] <fancyfetus> Each category has a name, but they don't have to be unique.
[17:19:23] <taplar_busy> you have the same name for multiple radios across multiple categories?
[17:19:38] <fancyfetus> oh. yes.
[17:19:41] <taplar_busy> oh shit dude
[17:19:44] <taplar_busy> no no no no
[17:19:46] <taplar_busy> fix that
[17:19:47] <fancyfetus> damn, I didn't think of that.
[17:19:56] <fancyfetus> I don't have multiple categories yet
[17:19:56] <taplar_busy> that's your problem, or one of them
[17:20:11] <fancyfetus> So it's okay *for now*
[17:20:11] <taplar_busy> the name should be unique per category
[17:20:19] <taplar_busy> per radio group
[17:20:26] <fancyfetus> the name should be unique per form, no?
[17:20:34] <fancyfetus> the form encompasses multiple categories.
[17:20:36] <taplar_busy> no, grouping
[17:20:46] <fancyfetus> er, right
[17:20:49] <fancyfetus> I misunderstood.
[17:20:54] <fancyfetus> So yeah
[17:21:26] <fancyfetus> All the backend cares about is which items are selected or not. It doesn't care about the "name" of a category.
[17:21:37] <fancyfetus> It just wants "item id": true/false
[17:21:39] <taplar_busy> it has to care about the name of the radios
[17:21:56] <taplar_busy> all forms submit based on the name of the variable and it's value
[17:24:07] <taplar_busy> it's up to you to construct the name in such a manner that your backend can relate different fields together
[17:24:43] <fancyfetus> Got it!
[17:24:57] <fancyfetus> for checkboxes, the name is: "item-<id of item>"
[17:25:15] <fancyfetus> for radio buttons the name is: "category-<hashcode of category>"
[17:25:36] <fancyfetus> that way it's unique and I can reference it again just by checking if it's an item or a category and searching for it.
[17:25:36] <taplar_busy> you might try something like
[17:26:01] <taplar_busy> "<id of item>"-item
[17:26:04] <taplar_busy> err
[17:26:25] <taplar_busy> "<id of item>-item" and "<id of item>-category"
[17:26:41] <taplar_busy> assuming 'item' is what each checkbox relates to and is variable
[17:27:05] <taplar_busy> but at least in that case the prefix identifies groupings
[17:27:13] <taplar_busy> what's your backend?
[17:28:23] <fancyfetus> play framework
[17:28:35] <taplar_busy> hmm, i don't know anything about that one
[17:28:52] <taplar_busy> scala and java
[17:28:56] <taplar_busy> intersting
[17:29:05] <fancyfetus> taplar_busy: one category contains multiple items, so I can't do "<id of item>-category"
[17:29:21] <fancyfetus> the value returned will be the id of the item.
[17:29:37] <taplar_busy> what is the over arching object?
[17:29:57] <taplar_busy> we're talking about radios and checkboxes, but they each belong to "something"
[17:30:11] <taplar_busy> they are chosen as options to "somethign"
[17:31:00] <fancyfetus> alright
[17:31:02] <fancyfetus> so:
[17:31:40] <fancyfetus> A service has ONE item (defining the service itself) and a list of categories.
[17:31:48] <taplar_busy> so a service!
[17:31:50] <taplar_busy> there we go
[17:31:51] <fancyfetus> each category has a name (not unique) and a list of items.
[17:32:22] <taplar_busy> each of these groups of checkboxes and radio buttons are changing/effecting a 'service'
[17:32:24] <fancyfetus> all items in a category are either checkboxes or radio types.
[17:32:30] <fancyfetus> yes
[17:32:35] <taplar_busy> there's your grouping prefix
[17:32:40] <taplar_busy> or suffix, whatever
[17:33:22] <fancyfetus> checkbox names represent the id of the item that they toggle
[17:33:29] <fancyfetus> radio button names can't do that.
[17:33:43] <fancyfetus> Alright, I gotta go though, done work now!
[17:33:48] <fancyfetus> I'll be on afterwards, I'm sure
[17:33:48] <taplar_busy> k
[17:33:57] <fancyfetus> Thanks a lot for all your help :)
[17:34:00] <taplar_busy> i'm out in a couple minutes, but others should be here
[17:34:05] <taplar_busy> one more quick thing
[17:34:06] <fancyfetus> alrighty
[17:34:22] <taplar_busy> some frameworks, if you put dot notation in your input names, will auto parse the input into maps
[17:34:27] <taplar_busy> might see if play does that
[17:34:34] <taplar_busy> could help you in your groupings
[17:34:37] <fancyfetus> play has it's own thing for that!
[17:34:41] <fancyfetus> thank!
[17:34:43] <taplar_busy> ah cool
[17:34:44] <fancyfetus> s*
[17:45:48] <taplar> mmm, ready to get home and do some gaming...
[17:53:33] <simonsaysdiaf> hm so dunmb quyestion
[17:53:42] <simonsaysdiaf> im using this to create a responsive table
[17:53:43] <simonsaysdiaf> https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/XdwLbp
[17:53:58] <simonsaysdiaf> and im wondering how i can have the button scroll to the top of the table when it's clicked
[17:54:44] <sillyslux> which button?!
[17:54:54] <simonsaysdiaf> the one it creates
[17:55:11] <simonsaysdiaf> if you shrink your screen down to movile
[17:55:17] <simonsaysdiaf> sorry, forgot to add thta
[17:55:28] <simonsaysdiaf> if you shrink your screen to movile, there's a 'compare next' button
[17:55:31] <sillyslux> document.createElement('button');
[17:56:03] <simonsaysdiaf> createButtons();
[17:56:06] <simonsaysdiaf> is already there
[17:56:19] <sillyslux> yeah found it :)
[17:56:45] <sillyslux> top of the table as in "above the table"?
[17:56:50] <taplar> i don't see any jQuery in there yo
[17:56:50] <sillyslux> but only on click?
[17:56:55] <simonsaysdiaf> sillyslux: yea
[17:57:01] <simonsaysdiaf> taplar: pls forgive me? :>
[17:57:06] <taplar> ##javascript
[17:57:53] <bango2> any particular, glaring reason this code snippet wouldnt find the divs within each of these and remove them? http://pastebin.com/pissQ4fk
[17:58:05] <Karie91> Hi, i'm looking for some help with a small issue i have...
[17:58:35] <taplar> bango2: looks fine, though you don't need the each
[17:58:43] <bango2> ok ty
[17:58:54] <taplar> and also think about using a class, :P
[17:59:01] <Karie91> Can someone send me a pm ? I'm willing to pay.... :(
[17:59:18] <simonsaysdiaf> Karie91: maybe just ask your question fam
[17:59:32] <taplar> Karie91: just ask your question.  if anyone can help they'll pipe in.  and it's a free support/teaching room
[17:59:35] <Tomatosoup1> is jquery mature enough to fully cooperate with REST API ?
[17:59:37] <bango2> ill consider it tap, thanks haha
[17:59:42] <taplar> we're more here to help you learn to code
[17:59:42] <bango2> gotta go now though
[17:59:42] <Karie91> Oh ok :)
[18:00:11] <taplar> Tomatosoup1: what are you referring to as "rest api"?
[18:01:07] <Karie91> I want to auto-refresh/update information that is added to a database(sql) And display that information in a ticker, i'm currently using this ticker :
[18:01:08] <Tomatosoup1> taplar: representational state transfer - an api which sends JSON to specific URL's
[18:01:18] <Karie91> jquerynewsticker.com
[18:01:27] <taplar> i understand what REST is.  but are you referring to a specific api or plugin or something?
[18:01:39] <taplar> cause $.ajax can handle most method types
[18:01:45] <Tomatosoup1> my own rest api
[18:01:58] <Karie91> Tried everything, i even have a php file that display the RSS, i followed the documentation but it dosnt work... :(
[18:02:04] <Tomatosoup1> im backend dev - and i just dont know if jquery is enough to cooperate with that api ;)
[18:02:11] <taplar> Tomatosoup1: should be
[18:02:14] <Tomatosoup1> or should i use angular or backbone
[18:02:54] <taplar> Tomatosoup1: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[18:04:34] <Karie91> Thank you Taplar, not sure i will understand everything but i'll try
[18:04:36] <taplar> Karie91: can you make a fiddle (jsfiddle.net) of what you've tried?
[18:05:02] <taplar> i'm fixing to head out, but it can help us greatly see what you've tried and to help debug with you
[18:06:28] <taplar> later all, have a good *insert your time of day*
[18:06:50] <Karie91> I'm working on this page : http://dev.mcstudios.ca/ticker_test/index5.php
[18:08:17] <Karie91> http://dev.mcstudios.ca/ticker_test/index.php   ( this page works but i want to be able to auto-update the content from the DB with ajax ) But nothing seems to work
[18:10:38] <Karie91> i've been stuck on this issue for a while now... :(
[18:18:44] <Karie91> Is there anyone that can help?
[18:18:57] <sillyslux> looking at it..
[18:19:20] <Karie91> Thank you sillyslux :)
[18:31:23] <sillyslux> you'll need -> feedUrl: 'PUT THE URL OF THE RSS FEED HERE - e.g. http://example.com/rss.xml',            feedType: 'xml'
[18:31:47] <sillyslux> where do you get you ticker items from?
[18:31:53] <sillyslux> php database
[18:31:56] <sillyslux> which url?
[18:32:00] <Karie91> yeah from a database
[18:32:21] <Karie91> i had this that generate a rss but the file is .php
[18:32:44] <Karie91> http://dev.mcstudios.ca/ticker_test/rss_feed.php
[18:32:53] <sillyslux> have you used that url anywhere?
[18:33:10] <Karie91> i've tried it yes but nothing shows up
[18:33:30] <Karie91> maybe because its a .php ?
[18:33:39] <sillyslux> yes feedUrl: 'rss_feed.php',
[18:34:03] <sillyslux> that's ok
[18:34:03] <Karie91> ok i'll try again
[18:37:46] <Karie91> Ok, i updated the path but still getting an error
[18:38:00] <Karie91> getting close i think :)
[18:38:16] <Karie91> thank you sillyslux
[18:38:34] <sillyslux> in site.js comment line 4
[18:39:08] <sillyslux> you're calling $('#js-news').ticker(); multiple times
[18:41:42] <sillyslux> did you remove that inline-script from index6.php?!
[18:41:53] <Karie91> yes i just did
[18:41:54] <sillyslux> the one with feedUrl: 'rss_feed.php',
[18:41:59] <sillyslux> put that back
[18:42:29] <sillyslux> or in site.js, to replace  $('#js-news').ticker();
[18:42:42] <Karie91> ok i see
[18:42:46] <Karie91> that helps thanks
[18:42:54] <Karie91> now i get : jquery.ticker.js:207 Uncaught ReferenceError: xmlContent is not defined
[18:43:40] <sillyslux> you can have only one $('#js-news').ticker() because it actually deletes the #js-news element
[18:44:25] <Karie91> Ok, now in the js, i had this
[18:44:40] <sillyslux> now the feed is loaded at least...
[18:44:55] <Karie91> hihi, yes that will help
[18:51:32] <Karie91> Only one small problem now, it seems my script is not able to locate ''channel'' in the RSS file
[18:51:50] <Karie91> but its there, it wasnt a few min ago but i just fixed that but its saying the same thing
[18:55:53] <sillyslux> oh there
[18:56:16] <sillyslux> the feed returns an xml document that starts at line 2
[18:56:24] <sillyslux> but it should start at line1
[18:56:46] <sillyslux> "error on line 2 at column 6: XML declaration allowed only at the start of the document"
[18:57:02] <sillyslux> parser error
[18:57:25] <Karie91> ahhhhhh
[18:57:49] <sillyslux> you have access to rss_feed.php?
[19:00:56] <Karie91> Yes
[19:01:11] <Karie91> do you think its  : header("Content-Type: application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8"); ?
[19:02:22] <sillyslux> can you copy the output of rss_feed.php to rss_test.php, delete the empty line 1 and try that?
[19:02:56] <Karie91> Good idea !
[19:03:06] <sillyslux> just copy/paste the output from the browser
[19:03:29] <Karie91> Different error but getting close !
[19:04:27] <sillyslux> 500?
[19:04:50] <Karie91> Yes, you know why ?
[19:05:02] <sillyslux> that rss_test.php has plain the browser output from http://dev.mcstudios.ca/ticker_test/rss_feed.php ?
[19:05:27] <Karie91> Yes, it does now
[19:05:31] <sillyslux> not starting with <?php
[19:05:42] <sillyslux> (shouldn't)
[19:05:47] <Karie91> No, only xml
[19:06:12] <sillyslux> The requested URL /ticker_test/rss_test.php was not found on this server.
[19:07:35] <Karie91> I chnaged the path now it should be alright but same problem
[19:08:02] <sillyslux> what's the url of that test xml?
[19:08:16] <sillyslux> it starts with <xml ?
[19:08:23] <sillyslux> not with an empty line?
[19:09:14] <sillyslux> HTTP ERROR 500 for http://dev.mcstudios.ca/ticker_test/rss_feed.php
[19:09:20] <sillyslux> what happened?
[19:09:45] <sillyslux> take back those changes in http://dev.mcstudios.ca/ticker_test/rss_feed.php
[19:09:53] <sillyslux> create http://dev.mcstudios.ca/ticker_test/rss_test.php
[19:10:09] <Karie91> Thats weird
[19:10:21] <sillyslux> put <xml... text from browser into that rss_test.php file
[19:11:48] <sillyslux> hey what's up :(
[19:12:32] <sillyslux> your original rss_feed.php has an empty line
[19:12:43] <sillyslux> starts with an empty line
[19:13:05] <Karie91> I did but for some reason we can't see the file anymore
[19:13:06] <sillyslux> error message states that this is not ok
[19:13:15] <sillyslux> to see if.. try with dummy
[19:13:32] <sillyslux> for some what?
[19:13:37] <sillyslux> server error?
[19:13:47] <sillyslux> can you access it's logs?
[19:13:59] <sillyslux> what have you access to?
[19:14:33] <sillyslux> are you working remote?
[19:14:40] <sillyslux> ftp or so?
[19:14:47] <Karie91> ftp yes
[19:14:52] <sillyslux> mhh
[19:15:01] <sillyslux> connection lost?
[19:15:19] <Karie91> i created another one with a different name, changed the name
[19:15:22] <Karie91> but same problem ?
[19:15:25] <Karie91> I dont get it
[19:16:36] <Karie91> For some reason it seems that if i just copy the outpout we cant access the file
[19:17:06] <Karie91> now i'm just trying to see where the empty line is coming from
[19:17:24] <sillyslux> The requested URL /ticker_test/rss_feed.php was not found on this server.
[19:17:59] <Karie91> Yes, i updated index5.php
[19:18:07] <Karie91> i chanaged the name of the rss page
[19:22:11] <Smashcat> Hello, any idea why this is returning a string, containing htmltext instead of a jquery object?  var e=$( ".butBar" ).children('img')[0]; - the .butBar is a div containing 3 img elements
[19:25:04] <sillyslux> Karie91, oh shit it starts with <?xml and php shortopen tag is <? that's probably enabled in your php config (in mine it is)
[19:25:20] <sillyslux> then rename it to rss.whatever
[19:26:04] <shoky_> Smashcat: use .eq(0) instead of [0] if you want it as a jquery object (and not as a raw DOMElement object)
[19:26:26] <Smashcat> Ok thanks
[19:26:27] <Karie91> You thnk ???? i'm going to try
[19:28:28] <Karie91> The file can be named rss.html for example ?
[19:28:36] <Karie91> With PHP code in it ?
[19:28:56] <sillyslux> :/ maybe .xml is better, or else apache will set response header content-type to something unfitting
[19:29:13] <Karie91> Getting error with .xml
[19:29:20] <sillyslux> or php and echo <<<EOF;
[19:29:59] <Karie91> good idea
[19:30:27] <Karie91> $rssfeed .= '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>';
[19:30:57] <sillyslux> yes
[19:31:49] <sillyslux> http://dev.mcstudios.ca/ticker_test/rss.php is now with 1st line empty again
[19:31:53] <Karie91> Same thing :(
[19:32:33] <Karie91> i will be right back
[19:37:53] <sillyslux> ahh http://ticker.exp.lan/
[19:38:05] <sillyslux> works with empty line removed
[19:38:25] <sillyslux> just get rid of that empty line and you're good
[19:39:20] <sillyslux> and changing links and everything :)
[19:43:38] <Karie91> ok i'm back
[19:43:45] <Karie91> But i need to go
[19:43:56] <Karie91> thanks a lot for your time sillyslux, you are amazing
[19:44:12] <Karie91> i hope i'll be able to find where is that empty space coming from
[19:44:43] <sillyslux> bye
[19:47:06] <sillyslux> Karie91, still there? if you're an developer, learn to use debuggers asap
[19:47:23] <sillyslux> they make things like this a *lot easier
[19:47:36] <sillyslux> for php there is php-debug
[19:47:49] <Karie91> Thats a Chrome Module ?
[19:48:00] <sillyslux> with plugins for sublime, atom, php-storm
[19:48:26] <sillyslux> not sure if there's an php-debug plugin for chrome
[19:48:30] <Karie91> Cool, thanks! :)
[19:48:48] <sillyslux> that'll help you find the empty line thing
[19:49:13] <sillyslux> debugger and breakpoint are the keywords
[19:49:22] <sillyslux> google that and learn asap
[19:50:00] <sillyslux> for js, chrome-dev-tools and firefox developer tools have that too
[19:52:29] <Karie91> Found something usefull also !
[19:52:29] <Karie91> ob_clean ();
[19:52:37] <Karie91> it works after that
[19:52:58] <sillyslux> that's php's output buffering?
[19:53:25] <sillyslux> haven't done a lot of php lately :/
[19:54:22] <sillyslux> oh look :) http://dev.mcstudios.ca/ticker_test/index5.php
[19:55:07] <Karie91> Yes :) It works
[19:55:40] <Karie91> Now just need to find out if its really going to update the display when i have a new item added to the db
[19:56:22] <sillyslux> nope
[19:56:29] <sillyslux> idts
[19:57:55] <sillyslux> you mean like without hitting f5?
[19:58:04] <Karie91> Yes :\
[19:58:34] <sillyslux> one way would be to check every now and then
[19:58:40] <sillyslux> with settimeout
[19:58:59] <sillyslux> the other would be with websockets
[19:59:20] <Karie91> Ok, i'll look into that :D
[19:59:25] <sillyslux> but the latter is more like a chat thing
[19:59:34] <Karie91> i dont have clue how to do this but i'll find a way
[19:59:39] <Karie91> :P
[19:59:48] <sillyslux> you need a backend server for that
[19:59:55] <sillyslux> apache is not good enough
[20:00:27] <sillyslux> that'll be node.js or a php script racket.io i think is it's name
[20:01:19] <sillyslux> the other thing is... i'm not sure if you can update the ticker-items easily
[20:02:34] <Karie91> On this page i was able to use ajax and do what i wanted
[20:02:44] <Karie91> but i'm not able to use that code and insert in that jquery ticker
[20:03:14] <marcandre> Hi! If I try npm install jquery@3.0.0-rc1
[20:03:24] <marcandre> I get └── jquery@3.0.0-rc1  invalid
[20:03:27] <Karie91> so i tried to use the ticker the way it was meant to, i did a few test with XML ( only thing that works with it )
[20:03:47] <Karie91> this page
[20:03:48] <Karie91> http://dev.mcstudios.ca/ticker_test/php/news_query.php
[20:04:31] <Karie91> Wanted to do something like that but with the ticker ( one line, pause button , previous and next )
[20:04:35] <Karie91> Only thing i need
[20:05:05] <sillyslux> marcandre, works for me
[20:05:50] <marcandre> Thanks @sillyslux, I must be doing something silly (as usual ;-)
[20:06:19] <DeafGoose> Hi all, how do I get all data-os attributes from $('#devices option:selected') all the selected options? I can get the value, but just not sure how to get the data-os attibute
[20:07:56] <shoky_> marcandre i'm also getting invalid, fwiw ;p
[20:07:59] <DeafGoose> have tried http://pastie.org/10868561 but I get an error
[20:08:07] <sillyslux> DeafGoose, i'm not sure myself... have you tried .attr('data-os')?
[20:08:10] <shoky_> is npm even updted with that version?
[20:08:37] <sillyslux> npm -v 3.9.3
[20:08:55] <DeafGoose> yea I get an error…Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'length' in....
[20:09:15] <shoky_> i meant the jquery version
[20:09:19] <sillyslux> Karie91, you want ticker items from html instead of xml feed?
[20:10:14] <rfc19> Hello, while I think I understand why this isn't working, I'm not sure how to resolve the issue -- https://jsfiddle.net/71n3h0c3/3/
[20:10:15] <marcandre> shoky_ I'm suspecting I have another dependency that excludes >=3?
[20:10:23] <sillyslux> aftr npm install jquery@3.0.0-rc1 i have ./node_modules/jquery/
[20:10:29] <rfc19> I'd like both items to be able to alert, however it's only working on the first selector
[20:10:42] <sillyslux> npm -v 3.9.3 node -v v6.2.1
[20:12:15] <shoky_> marcandre: ah, right, didn't notice i was installing it in a subdir of a dir with package.json with "jquery": "^2.2.2"
[20:12:55] <shoky_> marcandre: works fine in a different folder
[20:13:10] <marcandre> shoky_ yeah, probably it. Now I don't know how to find which dependency is the problem...
[20:13:26] <shoky_> probably the "jquery" one?
[20:14:48] <sillyslux> rfc19, it alerts for both checkboxes
[20:14:58] <rfc19> sillyslux: that's odd - it doesn't on my fiddle
[20:15:09] <sillyslux> sure?
[20:15:18] <sillyslux> close the alert box
[20:15:23] <rfc19> let me refresh/try a different browser
[20:15:26] <sillyslux> then click
[20:16:06] <rfc19> sillyslux: ahh, I had version /2/ open, where the selector was the #id
[20:17:16] <sillyslux> :D
[20:17:46] <rfc19> sillyslux: now it's not working when I move it to my web server
[20:18:02] <rfc19> exact same code, but the page has many other checkboxes on it
[20:18:45] <rfc19> It works on elements that are _not_ 'checked' when the page loads, however for elements that have 'checked>' enabled, it does not alert.
[20:20:32] <luciferkkkkaksdf> w0ng: hi man, how are you?
[20:21:32] <sillyslux> rfc19, you always reusing ids?
[20:22:02] <xnotte> when i do a $.ajax() call and the url: it's a file.php, the POST response shows all my file.php code, and not the "echo" or text. why this happens?
[20:23:09] <rfc19> sillyslux: I'm using the class as the selector now, but yes - it's the exact same across ~130 rows
[20:23:45] <sillyslux> id's are unique, don't reuse them
[20:24:06] <sillyslux> don't use them at all, unless you really really have to
[20:24:51] <rfc19> sillyslux: I've made that change, however no luck. My selector is my class, though
[20:25:08] <rfc19> xnotte: is your PHP code wrapped in <?php ?> tags?
[20:25:46] <xnotte> rfc19, just the first <?
[20:26:18] <xnotte> rfc19: my editor says the ?> it's redundant if its only php code
[20:26:33] <sillyslux> xnotte, <? is php short open tag which might be disabled, try <?php instead
[20:26:43] <rfc19> xnotte:  https://perishablepress.com/php-short-open-tag/ -- don't use short tags. Use <?php
[20:27:22] <xnotte> sorry, i have <?php, it was a typo
[20:27:45] <xnotte> i have closed ?> now, and still shows all my  code
[20:27:49] <rfc19> sillyslux: what I don't understand is why it works in the Fiddle, but not my live code. The only difference, basically, is that I have ~130 rather than 2.
[20:28:18] <sillyslux> rfc19, there probably is another difference
[20:28:23] <rfc19> sillyslux: an alert('blah'); doesn't even trigger with the event. It's as if the event isn't being seen.
[20:28:24] <sillyslux> you didn't notice ye4t
[20:29:56] <sillyslux> xnotte, if you open file.php directly, do you see plain code then?
[20:30:04] <xnotte> sillyslux: no
[20:30:18] <sillyslux> only on ajaxing it?
[20:30:25] <xnotte> yes
[20:30:25] <rfc19> sillyslux: it's wrapped in a 'span' for styling reasons, but i just tested that in the fiddle - still works in there.
[20:31:42] <rfc19> xnotte: do you have any HTML code in the file?
[20:31:53] <xnotte> rfc19: no, just php
[20:32:01] <Karie91> Thanks again sillyslux
[20:32:03] <Karie91> Bye bye
[20:32:05] <Karie91> :)
[20:32:08] <sillyslux> bye
[20:32:34] <rfc19> xnotte: can you pastebin the file?
[20:32:57] <sillyslux> and add your $.ajax call
[20:34:52] <xnotte> php: http://pastebin.com/1R4ZdH3K jquery: http://pastebin.com/2N6JJ0S3
[20:35:10] <VectorX> hi, in this, how can i change the 'word' world in the document to what is typed in the textbox ? https://jsfiddle.net/La750kfp/1/
[20:37:53] <rfc19> VectorX: while I'm not an expert at JQuery, this works -- https://jsfiddle.net/La750kfp/2/
[20:38:33] <rfc19> VectorX: you'll need to grab the input again. My Fiddle just shows you how it can change.
[20:38:44] <VectorX> rfc19 the text can be anywhere, as the example there are two instances, but i got it
[20:39:00] <rfc19> VectorX: oh right. Never mind :)
[20:39:02] <VectorX> https://jsfiddle.net/La750kfp/4/
[20:39:18] <rfc19> VectorX: nice one
[20:39:20] <rfc19> thanks for sharing
[20:40:09] <xnotte> rfc19: strange, right ?
[20:40:12] <VectorX> i need the text to be changeable multiple times though, so need to find a way to wrap a span or something around it dynamically and then add the new text as a content or something

[20:42:30] <hmmwhatsthisdo|W> Hey everyone, I'm trying to make a plugin for a jQuery-enabled site that adds a column to a table view. The UI currently has click listeners that sort the table when column headers are clicked. If my plugin is loaded after the listeners are added, is there a way to pull the listeners from one of the already existing columns instead of violating DRY and having it re-register listeners on the column(s) I added?

[20:42:49] <b-ot> Correction, <hmmwhatsthisdo|W> Hey everyone, I'm trying to make a plugin for a jQuery-enabled site that adds a column to a table view.

[20:43:46] <hmmwhatsthisdo|W> FWICT all of the listeners are the same and are applied with a .each that selects each <th> and registers the relevant listener
[20:46:53] <hmmwhatsthisdo|W> I should probably add that I did find the definition of the click handler applied to the other <th> elements, I just didn't want to have to copy it out of the site's source and paste it into my plugin
[20:46:59] <hmmwhatsthisdo|W> as it seems awfully kludgy
[23:27:50] <hmmwhatsthisdo> Still looking for help with cloning jQueryUI .observe() handlers if anyone's around.
[23:39:20] <pickandmix> hey guys, is this line correct? $('#WhiskyResultDiv1').css('background-image','url(lib/image/ResultWhisky/'+whiskyName1+'.png)');
[23:39:55] <pickandmix> I can't seem to get it to work. I'm think that my variable whiskyName1 has issues, when I create another variable, the line works. So I'm not really sure what's wrong?
[23:40:02] <pickandmix> My typeof whiskyName1 is a string.
