[04:03:07] <wpnublette> Hello. Do you know a tutorial that can help me learn how to copy the value of one form field to another? I tried searching but found only blogs field with ads and no relevant content.
[04:05:26] <Woet> what were your search terms?
[04:08:05] <wpnublette> copy one form field value to another
[04:09:11] <wpnublette> I realized that I need to use jquery...but don't know how to write a simple function that takes care of copying the value from one field to another
[04:09:29] <Woet> you don't need to use jquery
[04:09:40] <Woet> the first result for me has the answer: http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/forms/article.php/3898101
[04:09:46] <Woet> although that's not jquery
[04:09:57] <Woet> i would recommend googling for "jquery get input value"
[04:10:09] <Woet> which brings you to http://api.jquery.com/val/, which should answer your question
[04:10:58] <wpnublette> Woet: thank you...and excuse me.
[04:11:14] <Woet> no worries
[04:11:16] <wpnublette> Just what I needed
[04:39:01] <andrju> Hey guys, got a question. I've got something like this on my page: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/yvtvsfl99onl7om/c6zx8l84.png and I want to add on-hover effect to the lower panel, so I can see full song title, but when I do it it gets messy and I'd like to ask you if you know how could i solve that using jquery. It looks like that on hover: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/yvtvsfl99onl7om/vipwq-6q.png
[09:38:29] <sunbeam> does anyone know a plugin which lets me select a file (input field already there) and when the file is selected it puts it on the screen?
[09:38:33] <sunbeam> (image file)
[09:52:53] <Jattenalle> sunbeam, you cant do that without uploading the file to the server first
[09:52:57] <jeffreylevesque> is `$('.message').innerHTML = 'some string' ok syntax?
[09:52:58] <Jattenalle> sunbeam, security reasons
[09:53:32] <NicholasC> Jattenalle, that's not entirely true.
[09:53:42] <Jattenalle> NicholasC, anyone who has to ask, that's the answer
[09:53:51] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: It’s not, you’re mixing jQuery and vanilla dom
[09:53:56] <NicholasC> Jattenalle.. point. Carry on.
[09:54:01] <Jattenalle> NicholasC, ;)
[09:54:04] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: Do you want to do it the jQuery way or the DOM way?
[09:54:26] <jeffreylevesque> i see
[09:55:03] <Jattenalle> out of curiosity though how would you do it NicholasC? i think i'd actually just upload it with ajax as a preview, even knowing there are workarounds
[09:55:42] <NicholasC> Jattenalle, the lazy way: use that one plugin that meshes well with Bootstrap.
[09:55:43] <jeffreylevesque> systemfault: so, I should use html() instead of innerHTML()
[09:55:51] <jeffreylevesque> for jquery
[09:55:53] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: For jQuery objects, yes
[09:56:01] <Jattenalle> NicholasC, oh, no idea which one that is :P
[09:56:04] <jeffreylevesque> which is faster execution time
[09:56:13] <NicholasC> Jattenalle, let me grab a demo
[09:56:19] <jeffreylevesque> probably negligible difference, I don't know why i asked
[09:57:04] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: Pure DOM is always faster… it’s just that it’s usually more verbose than using jQuery. Also, jQuery fixes compatibility bugs of different browsers
[09:57:08] <NicholasC> Jattenalle, http://responsiweb.com/themes/preview/ace/1.3.1/form-elements.html scroll down to "Custom file element" click "allow only images" and upload a file, you'll see.
[09:57:43] <NicholasC> I'm not entirely sure how it does it, as I haven't had any need to implement it yet, though it IS on the agenda for later today, amusingly
[09:57:48] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: Example… you cannot modify the content of a table using innerHTML on old IE versions
[09:57:58] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: jQuery .html() has workarounds for that
[09:58:01] <jeffreylevesque> how old?
[09:58:08] <jeffreylevesque> true
[09:58:21] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: IE8… I don’t know if it’s fixed in IE9+
[09:58:21] <jeffreylevesque> and the speed is probably negligible compared to other factors
[09:58:25] <Jattenalle> NicholasC, hm, that does nothing for me on firefox.. i mean i can select the file just fine, but no preview shows up
[09:58:27] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: Yes.
[09:58:38] <NicholasC> Jattenalle, odd. I'm running Aurora and it works without a hitch
[09:58:56] <Jattenalle> NicholasC, just tested in chrome, same thing.. can select the file just fine, no preview
[09:59:13] <Jattenalle> maybe the browser has to run with higher privileges? *shrugs*
[09:59:21] <NicholasC> Dunno? http://i.imgur.com/f7OWsKm.png
[09:59:31] <NicholasC> Have a picture of a random hat that's on this PC for some reason
[09:59:33] <Jattenalle> yeah it just shows the "drop files here" box
[09:59:38] <NicholasC> weird.
[09:59:47] <Jattenalle> oh wait
[09:59:49] <Jattenalle> now it worked
[09:59:50] <Jattenalle> lol
[09:59:53] <Jattenalle> ok then
[10:00:01] <NicholasC> Takes a while for you I suppose then?
[10:00:04] <Jattenalle> i just reloaded the page
[10:00:07] <Jattenalle> and it worked instantly
[10:00:31] <Jattenalle> oh i see
[10:00:42] <Jattenalle> the script crashes if the image is too big
[10:00:45] <Jattenalle> and just dies after that
[10:00:51] <paul_uk> hi all, has anyone come across an opensource paint tool in jquery/canvas ?
[10:00:51] <NicholasC> Ah, damn
[10:00:56] <NicholasC> Well, that's good to know then
[10:01:05] <Jattenalle> mystery solved, wonder how they do it
[10:01:16] <Jattenalle> there's probably some new HTML5 magic to actually get thumbnails, who knows..
[10:01:59] <NicholasC> I've got the plugin running in another app of the company I work for, let me dig it up
[10:02:20] <Jattenalle> looks like FileReader is the way to go
[10:03:12] <Jattenalle> anyhow, i have to run
[10:03:15] <NicholasC> Jattenalle, seems to be a function the guy who made the template made himself: .ace_file_input()
[10:03:19] <NicholasC> Tata.
[10:04:54] <paul_uk> Jattenalle: there is no magic, they return the thumbnail on upload and push it to the img tag
[10:05:03] <paul_uk> i’ve done this myself with an image uploader
[10:10:32] <sunbeam> Jattenalle: there are many plugins that allow this
[10:10:43] <sunbeam> Jattenalle: I mean sorry there are many *sites* that allow this
[10:10:53] <sunbeam> Jattenalle: to see a preview of a picture you have just uploaded live on the website
[10:14:16] <sunbeam> Jattenalle: nvm i found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4459379/preview-an-image-before-it-is-uploaded
[10:35:11] <TheFuzzball> I'm looking to optimise my library stack, only using the things that are actually used and so on. I'm building a custom jquery excluding modules that are not used, and I notice that it's possible to rip out deferred. I like the idea of replacing jQuery's deferred with the ES6-promise implementation, or a shim for it if it doesn't exist. This will provide a consistent promise implementation throughout, as I'm using
[10:35:11] <TheFuzzball>  native promises server-side. Does anyone have any thoughts on the feasibility of writing a wrapper for native Promises to replace deferred?
[11:31:34] <Blaster> Is there something like next() that searches into the sibling's children as well?
[11:35:19] <Jattenalle> sunbeam, yeah FileReader
[11:39:39] <NicholasC> Blaster, nothing direct, no.
[11:40:06] <NicholasC> But you could use .siblings().find('whatever you're looking for'); to search just the siblings children
[11:40:24] <NicholasC> or.. .parent().children().find() to search all siblings and your origin element.
[11:41:01] <NicholasC> You could shorten .parent().find() to also search the child elements themselves instead of just their children
[11:43:36] <paul_uk> hi all, has anyone come across an opensource paint tool in jquery/canvas ?
[11:55:40] <guzzlefry> paul_uk: did you try the google?
[11:56:00] <paul_uk> guzzlefry: i always do before i come on irc
[11:56:13] <paul_uk> guzzlefry: if there isn’t anything, i guess i will build my own
[11:56:29] <guzzlefry> wpaint.js?
[11:56:54] <paul_uk> guzzlefry: nice i dont think i have seen that in my research
[11:57:07] <guzzlefry> I searched for "paint.js"
[11:57:22] <guzzlefry> Was hoping someone would be clever and name it after paint.net :)
[11:57:23] <paul_uk> heh
[11:57:52] <guzzlefry> The fill tool seems to leave lots of aliasing though. :/
[11:58:10] <paul_uk> ok well im just looking for starts on particular things.  im going to be developing an animated banner creator.  so you upload an animated gif.  which you can then edit if need be and then add border, text and then save it as an image.
[11:59:35] <NicholasC> I'd almost say you'd be better off with ImageMagick and Node.Js for that, paul_uk
[12:00:22] <paul_uk> NicholasC: not heard of that, lemme google
[12:01:45] <paul_uk> NicholasC: oh i see.  thanks for the suggestion, but i have a lot of those functions in another project with php-gd
[12:02:30] <NicholasC> paul_uk, so why are you rebuilding this in html5 then?
[12:04:44] <paul_uk> NicholasC: im replacing the need for a photoshop guy, with a photoshop lite app for an end user to be able to clone a banner, edit it, save it and then make it available to their advertising campaign.
[12:05:22] <NicholasC> Okay, but why are you doing this with js?
[12:05:40] <paul_uk> NicholasC: ok, what should i be using?
[12:06:15] <NicholasC> I'm not telling you you shouldn't. I'm just interested in why you want to use JS for this.
[12:06:31] <paul_uk> NicholasC: I already have a platform already built.  im going to extend it with this sub-app.
[12:06:48] <NicholasC> Alright, that makes sense then.
[12:06:57] <paul_uk> by using JS, i can keep my existing theme, familiarity with the application,etc.
[12:07:20] <paul_uk> i already have a simple lander editor which replaced the need for a web developer heh.  so im trying to reduce costs.
[12:08:00] <NicholasC> Alright, let me have a look.
[12:08:19] <NicholasC> I also assume you mean "need for a web designer" there.
[12:08:30] <NicholasC> http://jsvectoreditor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/index.html how about this?
[12:08:31] <paul_uk> yeah
[12:08:57] <paul_uk> NicholasC: thats nice
[12:09:07] <NicholasC> The guy who made it claims to've used html5 + http://raphaeljs.com/
[12:10:38] <NicholasC> raphael.js is on the MIT license, so you can include it in your stuff.
[12:10:52] <paul_uk> NicholasC: well I think this and the suggestion from guzzlefry are great starts.  I think I know how to do this now.  all im looking for is something relatively simple and can knock out banners for a/b testing.
[12:11:07] <paul_uk> NicholasC: thanks so much.
[12:11:23] <NicholasC> No problem. Good luck with your endeavor.
[12:15:18] <adv_> i get jquery-1.10.2.min.map failed resource
[12:16:33] <NicholasC> How nice for you, dear.
[12:17:17] <adv_> what is that?
[12:25:24] <cannap> Hi any know a good undo redo manager like i can record a div and so
[12:25:47] <cannap> div changes i mean
[12:27:09] <batfastad> Hi everyone. This is something really stupid, but how do you call a JS function within a jquery block? http://jsbin.com/cohexuwo/1/edit
[12:27:52] <batfastad> So I have an inline script that does an ajax submission, attempting to run loadfilespanel() on success:
[12:28:16] <batfastad> loadfilespanel() is defined in my document.ready
[12:31:03] <batfastad> I get a "Error: ReferenceError: loadfilespanel is not defined". I think it's to do with scope
[12:33:49] <NicholasC> batfastad, let's have a look.
[12:34:48] <batfastad> NicholasC: Thanks. My actual JS is a bit rusty, I just tend to hack around with jquery. Not really a frontend guy
[12:34:55] <NicholasC> batfastad, alright mate, you don't define js functions in the document.ready block.
[12:34:56] <batfastad> Anymore anyway
[12:35:10] <NicholasC> Move it out of your JS completely, just stick it above $(document).ready(function() {
[12:36:07] <NicholasC> Out of your jQuery - Sorry, It's been a long day.
[12:36:12] <batfastad> Awesome. But can I still use a jquery selector with the .load() function... $('#files').load('/page_files_list/$page_id');
[12:36:14] <adv_> anyone?
[12:36:30] <NicholasC> batfastad, yes.
[12:36:49] <NicholasC> adv_, you haven't asked a question.
[12:37:00] <adv_> i get jquery-1.10.2.min.map failed resource, why is that?
[12:37:16] <NicholasC> Have you tried googling it?
[12:37:24] <batfastad> NicholasC: perfect, will try now
[12:37:36] <NicholasC> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18365315/jquerys-jquery-1-10-2-min-map-is-triggering-a-404-not-found especially since this is the first hit, adv_?
[12:38:30] <NicholasC> batfastad, if you need any other help, don't hesitate and all that.
[12:38:33] <adv_> NicholasC: so i can safely ignore it?
[12:39:12] <NicholasC> adv_, the article seems to suggest that, yes. I'd do the fix, though.
[12:42:07] <batfastad> NicholasC: Works like a champ, thx for your quick reply. I knew it would be something stupid :D
[12:42:32] <NicholasC> :)
[13:13:00] <sunbeam> after I have added a file in input type=file field
[13:13:07] <sunbeam> how can I check what type of file it is?
[14:06:19] <aot2002> I built a generic ajax call function that I could reuse and I now want to pass the parameter back through when data is returned from the server. It works without the data parameter but with it throws an error. Any pointers in the right direction would be great. http://pastebin.com/4Qhdzj7f
[14:18:18] <aot2002> nm
[14:24:27] <droid909> how do i check if i changed textarea
[14:25:22] <droid909> on('blur') ?
[14:26:54] <Woet> droid909: on change?
[14:44:46] <droid909> Woet: not for input type, i meant input type = text
[14:45:00] <Woet> i'm not sure what you mean.
[16:36:48] <OmicroN_> when using $.ajax with a setTimeout is it suppose to force GET request? and if so can you make it POST? and why does it GET anyways
[16:43:38] <OmicroN_> ahh i see whats going on
[18:28:09] <jumanji> how can I measure similarity between 2 DOM trees?
[18:33:20] <BillCriswell> jumanji: That's a tough one. I think you can do equality but similarity would be a pain in the ass.
[18:33:45] <jumanji> BillCriswell: i thought about tree traversal
[18:33:57] <jumanji> BillCriswell: but it won't be robust enough as soon as you run into a node that is different, it will stop
[18:34:59] <BillCriswell> jumanji: Why do you need to do this?
[18:35:16] <jumanji> BillCriswell: i want to know if a page is structurally similar to another page
[18:35:17] <zeroquake> does anyone know of a project integration facebook checkins , foursquare , fitbit and so on api ??
[18:35:45] <jumanji> BillCriswell: I got another idea, represent the entire DOM tree as a token string. compare both token string, find out where things are different, calculate score.
[18:38:28] <Zak> is jquery.hive still the standard approach for trying to utilize jquery stuff in web workers?
[18:43:18] <tw2113> i think .live got removed in like 1.7
[18:44:44] <erming> tw2113: he didn't misspell
[18:44:48] <erming> https://github.com/rwaldron/jquery-hive
[18:44:53] <tw2113> oops
[18:44:58] <tw2113> my bad
[18:53:02] <star18bit> max( array) outs put  -Infinity ?
[19:26:17] <wa5ted> let the gif wars begin: http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/03/this-extension-gives-you-a-new-gif-every-single-time-you-open-a-tab/?utm_campaign=fb&ncid=fb
[20:07:24] <kaylors> How do I make an event fire when the user has scrolled a certain distance down the page?
[20:07:58] <kaylors> Note that if the user reloads the page and the position is below that distance, then the event should be fired as well (thus the waypoints.js isnt helpful here)
[20:14:04] <BillCriswell> kaylors: You can probably use waypoints still just do $('body').trigger('scroll') when the page loads. I think.
[20:29:35] <star18bit> var array = [impact_c: "2", impact_f: "2", impact_h: "2", impact_l: "2", impact_org: "1"…]; Math.max.apply(Math,array); console log gives me -Infinity
[20:30:36] <kaylors> BillCriswell: Say the user reloads the page and at that time is in the middle but my waypoint trigger is near the top. Will it still fire unless the user scrolls back up?
[21:04:51] <sammych> ookay. I'd like to move the input[type=range] for a jQuery Mobile Slider to another location
[21:05:06] <sammych> can this thing be done?
[21:07:16] <sammych> okay, never mind, I got this
[21:08:15] <stud3nt> hi
[21:16:37] <stud3nt> how they change the navigation into icons when i click the trigger? http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0R5L90S
[21:18:22] <d3m0n> Anyone ever use Angular.js? I am confused on why this would be better than using PHP or Ajax?
[21:56:08] <dsdeiz> hi all
[21:57:43] <dsdeiz> for selectors, are these the same? http://pastebin.com/nUgfv056
[22:09:51] <sammych> this place is mega quiet when I need some assistance
[22:09:55] <sammych> always(
[22:18:26] <d3m0n> dsdeiz: Indeed it does look the same
[22:18:45] <dsdeiz> cool. thx. i didn't know $('> div', this) works
[23:08:21] <nights> hi
[23:08:43] <nights> how can i serialize form components enclosed in a div?
[23:09:43] <nights> or rather, why doesnt it work to ajax post it?
[23:11:01] <nights> like so: data: { employee_data: $('#employeepanel_form').serialize() },
[23:11:18] <nights> where #employeepanel_form is the div
[23:36:59] <superjacaman> hey guys!
