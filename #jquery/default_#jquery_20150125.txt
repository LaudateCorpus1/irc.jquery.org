[04:00:47] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[04:54:52] <flayks> hey there! i'm looking for a solution to move a custom horizontal scrollbar handler when I scroll a div, to show the progress. Any idea? http://jsfiddle.net/tccsq6e9/2/
[06:41:30] <hamster88> Hello
[06:41:45] <hamster88> is there a good book or resource to learn jquery from ?
[06:41:49] <arthurvr> hamster88: Hi!
[06:41:57] <hamster88> I am absolute beginner to this
[06:41:58] <arthurvr> hamster88: I’d reccomend learn.jquery.com
[06:42:14] <arthurvr> hamster88: it’s the official learning center
[06:42:39] <arthurvr> hamster88: just start reading, trying, and making stuff
[06:42:49] <hamster88> well i don't have internet access all the time so not really possible to be there on that website , so a book or some sort of video tutorial might help
[06:43:01] <arthurvr> hamster88: oh
[06:43:09] <arthurvr> hamster88: clone the github repo :)
[06:43:15] <arthurvr> hamster88: it’s all markdown
[06:43:35] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com
[06:43:45] <hamster88> arthurvr, thanks !!!
[06:43:50] <arthurvr> all the articles are in the `page/` directory
[06:44:14] <arthurvr> and the order you have to read them are in order.json
[06:44:22] <arthurvr> hamster88: You’re welcome :)
[06:44:34] <hamster88> another question here tho..
[06:44:49] <hamster88> what is the difference between jquery and javascript?
[06:44:57] <arthurvr> jQuery is a javascript framework
[06:45:03] <arthurvr> javascript is a language
[06:45:33] <hamster88> there is a website called mackenziechild.me <<   does that use jquery?
[06:45:57] <arthurvr> hamster88: yes it does
[06:46:27] <hamster88> do i really need to learn Java to use Jquery or javascript you know.
[06:46:40] <arthurvr> java is in no way related to javascript
[06:46:45] <arthurvr> it are seperated things
[06:46:53] <arthurvr> javascript is a scripting language in the browser
[06:47:09] <arthurvr> java isn’t :)
[06:47:30] <hamster88> a guy around in my vicinity told me that i need to learn java to understand javascript and jquery and what not ugh..
[06:47:41] <arthurvr> hamster88: you shouldn’t.
[06:48:03] <hamster88> yeah i don't want to dive into gory details xD
[06:49:07] <arthurvr> hamster88: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#JavaScript_and_Java
[06:49:29] <hamster88> arthurvr,  yeah just checked it out
[06:50:26] <hamster88> I just downloaded that whole zip
[06:50:45] <arthurvr> hamster88: what zip? jQuery itself?
[06:50:55] <arthurvr> hamster88: oh the repo
[06:50:59] <hamster88> yep repo
[06:51:00] <arthurvr> hamster88: I’ve got it
[06:51:41] <arthurvr> hamster88: but anyhow you will first need to get started with javascript
[06:51:48] <hamster88> don't have github installed on my good old computer.
[06:51:54] <arthurvr> hamster88: jQuery is built upon javascript remember?
[06:51:56] <arthurvr> :)
[06:51:58] <hamster88> I got one book for javascript
[06:52:13] <hamster88> let me tell you name so you can tell if its good or not
[06:53:01] <arthurvr> hamster88: perfect. Go read that and then come back to jQuery.
[06:53:14] <arthurvr> :-
[06:53:16] <arthurvr> :-)
[06:56:00] <hamster88> i think i lost that book :(
[06:56:16] <hamster88> can you suggest any good book that is available in PDF too?
[06:58:05] <arthurvr> hamster88: f course I can
[06:58:11] <arthurvr> hamster88: https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-jquery-fourth-edition for example
[06:58:55] <hamster88> thank you arthurvr
[07:00:29] <hamster88> is "Eloquent_JavaScript" this book good for learning javascript?
[07:00:46] <arthurvr> hamster88: for sure
[07:01:08] <hamster88> thanks for suggestions and helping out
[07:01:15] <hamster88> have a great day/night :)
[07:01:21] <arthurvr> hamster88: you’re welcome!
[07:01:30] <hamster88> soon will be back with my tons and tons of questions haha
[07:01:36] <hamster88> bye :)
[07:01:40] <arthurvr> feel free to ping me then
[08:05:29] <t4nk856> Hi
[08:05:37] <arthurvr> t4nk856: Hi!
[08:05:47] <t4nk856> Just a test :D
[08:18:19] <rb___> Hey guys, I can't remember the name of a JS (maybe Jquery) plugin that would dim all elements on a page but a selected one, kinda putting it on the spot, any idea?
[09:56:43] <rebrec__> hello
[09:56:51] <arthurvr> hi rebrec__
[09:57:38] <rebrec__> i am trying want to make a form that send post data to my web server without changint the actual page, could someome give me the direction i need to take for that please ?
[09:58:23] <rebrec__> my form contain a "save" button, i don't it to send me to the "post" webpage, just to send post data for backup purpose
[09:58:33] <arthurvr> send it on the submit event, call event.preventDefault() and submit it using $.ajax
[09:58:50] <arthurvr> `api jQuery.ajax
[09:58:50] <b-ot> arthurvr: jQuery.ajax(): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:58:56] <arthurvr> `api submit
[09:58:56] <b-ot> arthurvr: .submit(): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[09:59:05] <arthurvr> `api event.preventDefault
[09:59:05] <b-ot> arthurvr: event.preventDefault():  If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered.  http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:59:10] <rebrec__> and does i need to get manually every parameters arthurvr to send them using ajax ?
[09:59:22] <arthurvr> rebrec__: nope
[09:59:25] <arthurvr> use serialize()
[09:59:28] <arthurvr> `serialize
[09:59:33] <arthurvr> `api serialize
[09:59:33] <b-ot> arthurvr: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[09:59:45] <rebrec__> great thanks you both i will check all that :)
[10:12:49] <rebrec__> thanks arthurvr and b-ot, it works perfectly :)
[10:13:14] <arthurvr> rebrec__: b-ot says you’re welcome
[10:13:40] <arthurvr> :)
[10:13:52] * rebrec__ didnot realize it was a bot ... lol
[10:14:05] <arthurvr> rebrec__: hahaha… serious?
[10:14:09] <rebrec__> yep
[10:14:22] <rebrec__> i though he was just talking to you instead of me ...
[10:14:25] <rebrec__> :/
[10:14:30] <arthurvr> If he wasn’t he must be really fast at typing
[10:14:40] <rebrec__> most devs are ;)
[10:29:49] <stavros> hello
[10:30:31] <stavros> i have two jquery elements (i mean like $("#foo")) and i want to copy them inside another element, such as a <div>. how can i do that? .append() seems to remove the originals from the original place
[10:33:48] <Azrael_-> hi
[10:34:17] <Azrael_-> i'm using datepicker, but if i select a date the datepicker only closes if i click somewhere else. i want the datepicker to close directly after i clicked onto a date.
[10:34:25] <stavros> i'm calling $("a#foo").html() but i'm not getting the actual a element back, just its children. is that normal?
[10:44:59] <systemfault> yup
[10:45:38] <systemfault> .html is to get/set the html of an element.
[10:45:43] <systemfault> It won't get "itself"
[11:16:24] <nofxx> Confused what's the best, recommended approach here: moving to new jquery no live().  Have a form with lots of js goodies: dates, validations, whatnot... how would one reapply those functions to dinamically created fields ?
[11:17:07] <nofxx> Of every 10 on() examples, 11 are 'click'... I'm missing something pretty stupid no?
[11:27:19] <Ansikt> nofxx, live is the default delegated event handler
[11:28:36] <Ansikt> So, in jQuery > 1.8.x, $('.my-div').live('click', myCallback); becomes $('html').on('click', '.my-div', myCallback);
[11:29:54] <Ansikt> So, essentially what live does is listen to every click on the HTML element, and then check if that click originated from '.my-div', and if so, call myCallback.
[11:30:54] <Ansikt> So, if you pass a second argument to .on, it filters in a similar manner, but this time you can actually change what live is delegated to to be something lower than HTML.
[11:31:39] <Ansikt> For example, you could make live listen to a <form> for all <input> events in it, and that way the browser would have to spend less time figuring out what triggered the event.
[11:32:28] <Ansikt> (only thing is, you'd have to be sure that the form is there when you bind it, and that nobody removes or replaces it.  The inputs can by dynamically generated, however)
[11:52:17] <nofxx> Ansikt, thank you for the reply. But what event should I listen for added inputs on my form?
[11:56:08] <Ansikt> To know when an input is added to your form?
[11:56:13] <Ansikt> Why would you want to do that?
[12:03:35] <nofxx> Ansikt, need to apply all the libraries/bindings to the new fields one example, datepicker:   $('.datepick').datepicker()  , in my head pseudo code:  $('form').on 'created', '.datepick' ->  this.datepicker()
[12:04:06] <nofxx> Ansikt, I mean, the first code will not work on dinamically created inputs with class 'datepick'
[12:04:40] <Ansikt> nofxx - why is something creating fields that you have no control over?
[12:05:33] <Ansikt> I'll preface this by saying that you can't reliably or efficiently determine when things are added to DOM.  That being said, trying to determine this is a signal that you've built your app in a way which isn't scalable.
[12:06:11] <nofxx> Ansikt, you mean like a hook on my createFields() ? after it I run some kind of bindAllFormJSAgain()
[12:07:12] <aias> hi. i have almost zero experience with javascript. i've decided to use a jquery datepicker for a project i'm working on, but in all my newbishness i have done this...
[12:07:15] <aias> $( "#datepicker1" ).datepicker({ dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy' });
[12:07:35] <Ansikt> nofxx, Something like that, yeah.  You can use jQuery as your own event bus if you need to, and that can help with these kinds of issues.  I'd be careful to just rebind to the new fields, as you don't want to bind to any one field multiple times.
[12:07:42] <jcrawford> hey guys i have some HTML content that is generated by a service and injected into the HTML so I cannot simply add id's etc.  I would like to swap the position of the 2nd and 3rd font element in this HTML.  Could someone show an example of how i could swap these on page load?
[12:07:42] <jcrawford> http://pastebin.com/qcpM0KMT
[12:07:44] <aias> ...several times at the beginning of my index.php for each time an input field uses the datepicker
[12:08:19] <aias> is there anyway i can condense several lines of `$( "#datepicker1" ).datepicker({ dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy' });` into one?
[12:08:36] <nofxx> aias, use a class  .datepick
[12:08:38] <Ansikt> aias, When you use a # that means you're using an html ID.  Html IDs must be unique
[12:08:39] <aias> to have #datepicker1, #datepicker2, #datepicker3 etc...
[12:08:58] <nofxx> Ansikt, grasping.. thank you very much
[12:09:10] <aias> Ansikt: exactly, that's why i have included this line 8 times incrementing the datpicker<number>
[12:09:11] <Ansikt> aias, give them all class="datepicker" instead of id="datepicker1", 2, etc
[12:09:34] <Ansikt> nofxx's answer is the right one :)
[12:09:41] <aias> nofxx, Ansikt. i'll try a class. thank you :)
[12:11:12] <Ansikt> jcrawford, that seems like a bad solution.  Why can't you just change the order on the backend?
[12:11:31] <jcrawford> Ansikt: it's Volusion lol so much shit you cannot change
[12:12:02] <jcrawford> they said the only way to change the order of the elements is to use JS because their backend generates the HTML by the time I have it to modify i would need to use JS
[12:12:32] <jcrawford> i'd rather have the starting@ be the last price listed so it can be larger font and color and not look odd between other prices lol
[12:13:15] <aias> nofxx, Ansikt: brilliant. that works a treat. thank you again!
[12:14:04] <Ansikt> $('.productnamecolor.colors_productname').insertAfter('.pricecolor.colors_productprice'); should do the trick
[12:14:12] <Ansikt> but still.  eww
[12:14:40] <jcrawford> nope: http://jsfiddle.net/yrfq0mzw/
[12:14:59] <nofxx> Ansikt, sorry bother: lil question.. adding new html wont have page ready binding, ok, but some kind of cloning a already on page html would?
[12:16:32] <Ansikt> nofxx, I don't quite follow your question.  Mind rephrasing?
[12:19:18] <jcrawford> ahh i got it
[12:19:19] <jcrawford> http://jsfiddle.net/yrfq0mzw/3/
[12:19:23] <jcrawford> had to put it in an each
[12:19:34] <nofxx> Ansikt, take our friend datepicker example, if I add it dinammicaly, HTML("<input ..class=datepick....."   it wont work.  But if I clone an already on page working one, it will have all the bindings?
[12:23:22] <Ansikt> jcrawford, I accidentally put them in the wrong order
[12:23:23] <Ansikt> http://jsfiddle.net/yrfq0mzw/4/
[12:25:22] <Ansikt> nofxx, That depends.  I can't remember the method sig for clone off the top of my head, but I think it takes a parameter whether or not to retain event handlers.
[12:26:28] <Ansikt> Though, I think you just need to rebind them.  It shouldn't be a problem.
[12:26:33] <Ansikt> All that document ready does is:
[12:27:53] <Ansikt> when your web browser gets an HTML document, it slowly reads that document top to bottom.  When it sees an HTML element, it puts it in the document.  When it sees a script, it runs it.  If your script tries to access an element which isn't already in the document (ie, it's below the script tag), the script will be unable to find it.
[12:28:09] <Ansikt> Document.ready gets triggered when the browser has read the entire page from top to bottom.
[12:28:33] <Ansikt> Anywho - point being, if your element is on the page at the time to try to access it from JS, it should succeed.
[12:30:07] <jcrawford> Ansikt: yea i saw that , thank you very much :D
[12:30:55] <Ansikt> jcrawford, do you have to do this multiple times on a single page?  If not, you shouldn't need .each
[12:31:08] <Ansikt> Also, you could probably clean it up a little like so:
[12:31:12] <jcrawford> i do for each item listed ;)
[12:32:15] <jcrawford> Ansikt: if you could assist with one more question... is there a way to change the color of just the price (when it's not surrounded by a tag)
[12:32:16] <jcrawford> http://jsfiddle.net/yrfq0mzw/5/
[12:32:25] <Ansikt> jcrawford: http://jsfiddle.net/yrfq0mzw/6/
[12:32:30] <jcrawford> you can see what i mean there but would not want starting@: to change color just the price
[12:32:48] <jcrawford> oh wow so much cleaner than mine lol'
[12:35:16] <Ansikt> jcrawford, http://jsfiddle.net/yrfq0mzw/9/
[12:35:23] <Ansikt> Just reset the color of the starting at
[12:35:33] <Ansikt> also, don't use jQuery.css.  It's bad for your health.
[12:37:02] <Ansikt> jcrawford, Woops, forgot to update.  Look at this one instead: http://jsfiddle.net/yrfq0mzw/10/
[12:39:06] <jcrawford> Ansikt: that doesn't have the proper order of elements though the first one did
[12:40:24] <Ansikt> http://jsfiddle.net/yrfq0mzw/11/
[12:40:27] <Ansikt> lol
[12:40:31] <Ansikt> > sliblings
[12:46:31] <jcrawford> :)
[13:39:05] <buzzlewoo> yo
[13:58:10] <visof> hi guys
[13:58:31] <visof> i'm trying to show gif while AJAX request complete then hide it
[13:58:39] <visof> what i did is http://pastie.org/9860239
[13:59:15] <visof> the problem is, the first click on the link don't give me gif, but the second click on the same page give me the loading gif
[13:59:34] <visof> why isn't it loading at the first and loading after that?
[13:59:46] <visof> anybody can help in this?
[15:12:02] <thankYou> hey! I have this code:  $('#ligne[25]').remove();  I dont know why it's not working? thanks
[15:12:55] <thankYou> when i do this: $('#ligne25').remove();  It works, but not when the id is an array $('#ligne[25]')
[16:45:08] <cryptopsy> does jqueryui support unicode icons instead of the regular icons?
[16:48:42] <cryptopsy> or ... where are those defined if i want to change them?
[17:11:29] <bilb_ono> I am trying to access the input field here: https://bpaste.net/show/e29176fb93cc  right now the value is blank. But $('#lat') doesn't seem to work. I think because its not a div? even though its inside of a div. Can someone help?
[17:12:30] <bilb_ono> ah nvm. its $( "input[name='lat']" )
[17:27:58] <FuryFoo> Morning gents.
[17:29:02] <trodis> hi is there a way to have a table which has a data-mode columntoggle and reflow?
[17:29:36] <FuryFoo> Can anyone show me an example in which you post the SQL row ID to PHP via AJAX and you get echoed back a value from that row like User's Email.
[17:33:54] <Azrael_-> FuryFoo: split it up to the small tasks and put it together easily with a few google-searches
[17:34:59] <trodis> Is it possible to have a table that is set data-mode="reflow" and data-mode="columntoggle" ?
[17:35:30] <FuryFoo> Google search in a private SQL DB ?
[17:35:32] <FuryFoo> http://www.infotuts.com/fetch-record-from-database-using-jquery-and-php/
[17:36:25] <FuryFoo> This is what I'm trying to do. But a bit more complex and I can use more similar examples.
[17:39:34] <FuryFoo> Let me make it more simple I need to get back the echo from PHP
[17:39:52] <FuryFoo> I post him id = 1
[17:40:02] <Azrael_-> still waiting for a question....
[17:41:37] <FuryFoo> PHP :  if($_POST['id'] == 1) { echo "Fire One"; } How can i get the echoed text from PHP ?
[17:42:28] <FuryFoo> Do you see what I'm trying to do ?
[17:45:37] <systemfault> FuryFoo: Not really. Do you want to echo as a normal page? Do you want to do ajax?
[17:49:25] <FuryFoo> I want to get the echo put it in a var and use it in my script.
[17:49:56] <looper989> can you post code?
[17:56:21] <Nyoom> [Super Easy] How can I do something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/6ket5863/ it doesn't seem to work D: it needs to insert text in the .pageContent class :/
[18:04:13] <looper989> your jsfiddle works
[18:04:25] <looper989> you haven't selected jquery
[18:04:44] <looper989> select one version of jquery that jsfiddle should use
[18:22:42] <Nyoom> oh
[18:27:53] <looper989> :)
[18:45:46] <trodis> Is it possible to have a table that is set data-mode="reflow" and data-mode="columntoggle" ?
[19:22:58] <baako> in a jquery function which accepts 2 permeter is they a way of  saying if this function is not function use this one?
[19:23:31] <baako> e.g.  channel.bind('response_message', addMessage OR USE addWaitingResponse);
[23:00:38] <B0t> hello, i need decript a javascript code
[23:03:25] <Kartagis> B0t: define "decrypt"
[23:03:53] <B0t> Ookkk
[23:03:54] <B0t> Http://pastie.org/9861226
[23:13:34] <synapt> B0t: It looks to be some kind of handler for a flash chat IRC client
[23:14:45] <B0t> Yes
[23:14:48] <B0t> I need the port
[23:16:00] <synapt> It doesn't seem to specify one so I assume it's probably using the default flash policy port
[23:16:06] <synapt> (843)
[23:16:26] <synapt> Or at the very least for connection to the network itself, standard IRC ports
[23:16:32] <B0t> Biiii+
[23:16:34] <B0t> Bi
[23:16:36] <B0t> NO
[23:16:49] <B0t> 843 is the privacy policy port
[23:16:52] <B0t> I need a irc port
[23:17:19] <synapt> There still isn't one, like I said, at the very least it's probably using standard IRC ports or something, or it's hard-encoded into the flash file itself and not the javascript file
[23:17:50] <B0t> Standard is 6667 but not work
[23:18:06] <synapt> the only reference to a "port" at all in that javascript is literally "policyPort", which would be 843, beyond that, it's likely hardcoded in the flash thing itself, not the javascript
[23:23:14] <B0t> Ok nice
[23:23:18] <B0t> Thanks synapt
[23:23:20] <B0t> Good nights
[23:25:11] <FrEaKmAn_> hi all.. is one using jQuery inside of chrome extension? problem that I have is that when I fetch (GET) the content of the external website, I try to find a src of specific image
[23:25:27] <FrEaKmAn_> so I do $(returnedHTML).find('img...
[23:25:42] <FrEaKmAn_> but it starts to load all the images inside the HTML
[23:25:46] <FrEaKmAn_> is this normal?
[23:26:25] <FrEaKmAn_> or is this chrome specific?
[23:28:57] <Puck6633> Aww, B0t left.
[23:29:05] <Puck6633> The correct port was 8541 :P
[23:31:27] <Cork> FrEaKmAn_: its chrome specific
[23:31:46] <Cork> FrEaKmAn_: or rather its running in privileged code specific
[23:31:59] <Puck6633> FrEaKmAn_: Assuming returnedHTML is a string, then I believe that $(returnedHTML) creates DOM elements for everything in the set which will load the images.
[23:31:59] <Cork> and might actually be a bug
[23:32:10] <Cork> Puck6633: no
[23:32:14] <Cork> it creates a dom fragment
[23:32:27] <Cork> and it shouldn't prefetch third party content
[23:32:36] <Cork> (when it runs in content code)
[23:32:41] <Puck6633> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/476679/preloading-images-with-jquery Then why does that work?
[23:32:57] <Cork> privileged code needs to fiddle around to get things like this working
[23:33:00] <FrEaKmAn_> yes, returnedHTML is a string
[23:33:15] <Cork> as it needs to load the content in content scope to not leak privileges
[23:33:16] <FrEaKmAn_> idea was to remove all img elements (except one that I need) with regex
[23:33:28] <Puck6633> Specifically the line $('<img/>')[0].src = this;
[23:33:35] <Cork> the solution for that might be that they create a worker page and loads the content there
[23:33:41] <Cork> and then you get the resource loading
[23:33:48] <Cork> not fully sure there though
[23:35:28] <Cork> Puck6633: that used to work, but i don't think it does anymore
[23:35:41] <Cork> browsers optimize image loading quite heavily now days
[23:36:06] <Puck6633> Cork: Ah. Good to know. Thanks! :)
[23:40:42] <Puck6633> Just for the record though, Firefox 35 does still preload images that way.
[23:42:03] <Cork> Puck6633: tried on mobile?
[23:42:23] <Cork> cause there is where i would expect it not to work
[23:42:52] <Puck6633> Only on desktop. I just opened the console and created an image in memory. http://pastie.org/private/s2kxx1fte2dzmckhjm7n1g
[23:43:13] <Puck6633> Was the original question in relation to mobile?
[23:43:15] <Cork> that isn't creating an image in memory :)
[23:43:29] <Cork> its creating an unattached dom element
[23:43:40] <Cork> and loads a resource to it
[23:43:50] <Cork> if you created an image in memory it would be something like a canvas
[23:44:09] <Puck6633> Ah. Even so, isn't $(returnedHTML) the same thing?
[23:44:40] <Puck6633> if, say, returnedHTML is '<img src="https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo11w.png" />'
[23:45:15] <Cork> it is, so ya, you're correct
[23:45:25] <Cork> the effect is expected on "most" browsers
[23:45:32] <Cork> but not guaranteed to happen
[23:47:19] <Puck6633> So in relation to FrEaKmAn_'s question, could that not be why the images are loading? I'm assuming Chrome on desktop is what he was referring to by inside of a Chrome extension.
[23:47:59] <Puck6633> I'm not very well versed in Javascript, so I'm genuinely curious.
[23:48:29] <Cork> Puck6633: that was what i was trying to say with my last comment
[23:48:48] <Puck6633> I use $(variable) pretty often without thinking about it, and it's not always to insert something in the DOM so I'm wondering if I should be more careful.
[23:48:49] <Cork> i remembered wrong
[23:49:20] <Cork> if you don't want to risk loading the resources you shouldn't do that ya
[23:49:37] <Puck6633> I'm actually beginning to wonder what happens if you do that with an HTML5 video tag. XD
[23:49:56] <Cork> depends if the tag has autobuffer on or off
[23:50:12] <Cork> or prebuffer or what ever the attribute is called
[23:50:41] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attr-autobuffer
[23:50:56] <Puck6633> So in other words it gets loaded according to the preload attribute just like you inserted it into the DOM. That's a scary thought in relation to the project I'm working on. I always thought DOM fragments just kind of existed in an ethereal state.
[23:53:07] <Cork> Puck6633: ya, i keep forgetting that part my self, and this conversation reminded me
[23:53:24] <Puck6633> Is there a good way to search a node tree without creating a DOM fragment like in FrEaKmAn_'s case?
[23:53:35] <Cork> there is only one way
[23:53:36] <Puck6633> Or is a regex the best way?
[23:53:38] <Cork> regex
[23:53:42] <Puck6633> Yikes.
[23:54:34] <Cork> like i said, some mobile browsers might break this loading mechanism to save bandwidth and storage (only load the image when it knows it will draw it)
[23:54:54] <Cork> but it definitely is how it works on desktop
[23:54:59] <Puck6633> Yeah. That makes sense.
[23:55:29] <Puck6633> I'm more concerned with accidental loading than things not loading! :o
[23:56:10] <Cork> what i start to think about is pages that use elastic design
[23:56:24] <Cork> where they hide parts of the ui when on small screens
[23:56:38] <Cork> how much data is actually wasted for images never shown...
[23:57:06] <Puck6633> I've been doing something akin to video = $('<video/>'); /* Do stuff with video here */ /* Much later and conditionally ... */ video.appendTo(node);
[23:57:32] <Puck6633> I'm creating probably several dozen video elements that way and only using a few of them. :\
[23:57:51] <Cork> Puck6633: have a look in the dev tools network tab
[23:57:57] <Cork> you should be able to tell what happens there
[23:58:11] <Cork> i *THINK* you're safe
[23:58:11] <Puck6633> Well, as you said mobile browser might not load the image if it's not visible.
[23:58:15] <Cork> but... who knows
[23:59:17] <Puck6633> It's an interesting consideration though. I don't even know how to properly debug mobile browsers. I think I read that Firefox mobile has some kind of remote debugging feature, but I usualyl just use the responsive design mode on desktop for most testing. :\
[23:59:49] <Puck6633> It'd be nice to see console output when loading on, say, an android phone.
