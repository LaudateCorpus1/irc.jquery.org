[07:12:22] <Kingsy> if I have a object -> this.$form = $('.some-form'); that contains two of the same elements, and I try to get that element -> $('input[data-type="name"]', this.form).val(); <- one is empty, and one isnt, how will jquery react? seems as though locally its returning the element with the value and once deployed the other way around, would it be random?
[07:25:08] <Cork> Kingsy: .val() always returns a string so it only returns the first matching value
[07:25:37] <Cork> you want something like $.map($('input'), function(elm) { return elm.value; })
[07:26:16] <Kingsy> that will return the val of the one that has it? so it will handle dupes?
[07:26:40] <Cork> Kingsy: that just creates an array of the values of the matching selector
[07:27:11] <Cork> https://api.jquery.com/val/#val1
[07:28:13] <Kingsy> let me have a go
[07:28:43] <Kingsy> Cork: why elm.value rather than elm.val() ?
[07:28:54] <Cork> you can do $(elm).val() if you prefer
[07:29:01] <Cork> but elm is dom elements not jquery wrapped elements
[07:42:27] <Kingsy> Cork: so yeah this is close to what I want I guess, what if I didnt want to return an array, but just the single value of the first element that has one?
[07:43:15] <Cork> all inputs has one
[07:43:29] <Cork> but you can use filter to filter out the ones that is an empty string
[07:43:56] <Cork> something like $('input').filter(function() { return this.value != '' }).val()
[07:44:27] <Kingsy> ah ok
[07:44:34] <Kingsy> this makes sense. let me try it out
[12:50:20] <Northwoods> how can i add style cursor: pointer to this element  --> <p data-editable > </p> using jquery
[12:50:36] <robertmaxrees> .css('cursor', 'pointer') ?]
[12:50:52] <robertmaxrees> or create a class in your css and then .addClass('foo');
[12:51:36] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, i mean what selector can i use ?
[12:51:45] <Northwoods> data-editable is not a class
[12:52:07] <robertmaxrees> do you have control over that markup?
[12:52:16] <robertmaxrees> and i'm aware it's not a class lol
[12:52:30] <Northwoods> lol
[12:52:37] <Northwoods> how can i select this element
[12:52:46] <robertmaxrees> you used an attribute selector earlier today - just do the same thing here...
[12:53:09] <Northwoods> Earlier today , no
[12:53:19] <robertmaxrees> oh sorry - i'm all mixed up lol
[12:53:23] <robertmaxrees> you want an attribute selector.
[12:53:26] <Northwoods> yes
[12:53:38] <robertmaxrees> 'p[data-editable]'
[12:53:47] <robertmaxrees> though i would use classes for something like that.
[12:54:34] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, but this is not wrong , correct ?
[12:54:44] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[12:55:03] <Northwoods> using attribute selector isn't wrong
[12:55:41] <robertmaxrees> it's not ideal.  and data attributes that don't have values are weird, too.
[12:55:52] <robertmaxrees> classes are a much better solution for something like this.
[12:57:31] <Northwoods> ok
