[04:50:11] <k200> hi
[04:50:27] <k200> how can i change border style of parent if parent has a tabset as child element?
[05:42:50] <Cork> k200: you can't style a parent based on a child

[06:41:03] <Tribute> Hello, everyone. Im trying to connect jquery ui sortable lists together, which where the source list is located on the client window, and the receiving sortable lists (Possible archive) is in an Iframe. I am facing the problem that once scrolled down an offset starts to appear. I have tried multiple things, all that i have listed in the Fiddle ( http://jsfiddle.net/8Jwxv/101/ ) The problem will
[06:41:04] <Tribute> be easily seen, for those who would try to help me out. Help would be greatly appreciated since im kind of desperate!
[07:03:31] <anexit> How can I run two jquery.min.js on the same page?
[07:16:17] <Tribute> @anexit Include 1 file, then create a reference for that jQuery variable lets say var jQuery2 = jQuery then include the other one, then you can access the first jQuery file with jQuery2, and the first one with regular jQuery.

[07:22:43] <mar77i> uh, history-wise, how far back can I expect $.post().fail() to work?
[07:31:37] <anexit> Tribute: Yeah, I'm using the same version though.
[07:34:46] <Tribute> anexit: why would you want two files then?
[07:37:03] <anexit> I'm using jquery file uploader and I'm also building an APi around it that uses jquery.min.js
[07:37:25] <anexit> My api uses jquery.min.js and then the blueimp file uploader dies
[07:37:31] <anexit> lol
[07:37:58] <anexit> I thought my solution would be; var $j = jQuery.noConflict();
[07:38:05] <anexit> no hot sauce though.
[07:38:35] <Tribute> have you figured out why it dies though? i mean, you could also create a local scope for instantiation of your file uploader.
[07:38:50] <sinopia> this shouldn't work for the exact word? .replace("(\btshirt_crianca\b)", "Kids")
[07:41:07] <anexit> Tribute, sharing the same file.  If I create two sepeart files jquer1 & jquery2 everything works but jquery file upload is missing the checkbox
[07:42:20] <Tribute> What do you mean with is missing the checkbox? Some kind of checkbox plugin?
[07:45:33] <Tribute> In any case, you might want to try and create a test scenario using jsfiddle of some kind. It might be easier to see what needs to be solved.

[08:20:24] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:38:13] <mar77i> hmm.
[09:38:24] <mar77i> yesterday i came here with a question
[09:38:32] <mar77i> 17:18 < mar77i> I find myself doing $($('stuff')[index])
[09:38:36] <mar77i> but apparently
[09:38:45] <mar77i> $('stuff').eq(index).length === 0
[09:40:49] <mar77i> ah, my bad
[09:41:04] <mar77i> I was looking at $('stuff') instead of $('.stuff')
[09:59:14] <taplar> mar77i: always important to have *sings* the right stuff
[10:00:17] <mar77i> you seemed gone before.
[10:06:49] <taplar_brb> hmm?
[10:29:05] <RenokK> heyho, i have a time on my page "13:37" as example. it has a click listener. on chrome/ios clicking this time opens a native modal to create a reminder. preventing my handler from doing its thing. event.preventDefault() doesnt help. any ideas?
[10:32:00] <taplar> RenokK: so you're saying there are two click handlers?
[10:33:49] <RenokK> i added my handler. $(document).on('click..... it's a span with a time as content. when clicking this, ios opens a dialog to create a reminder. (chrome on ios / iphone7), problem only occurs here.
[10:34:49] <taplar> dunno, i'd have to see it break but i don't have an ios device
[10:42:11] <RenokK> mhm... even onclick="return false;" doesn't prevent this...
[10:44:10] <Tennis> function(e){ e.preventDefault();
[10:44:55] <Tennis> place it higher up maybe i dont know i dont truly understand the issue
[10:49:06] <RenokK> already tried, seems to be some ios/browser foo happening here, reading it as time, trying to create a reminder entry.
[10:49:19] <RenokK> adding a zero-width non-joiner around the colon fixed the issue
[10:58:53] <MikeD_> what's a zero-width non-joiner?
[10:59:33] <taplar> i'm assuming a span with white space between two elements with font size of 0
[11:00:11] <MikeD_> <wbr>  ?
[11:01:15] <taplar> huh?
[11:01:52] <MikeD_> wbr is a tag that serves the purpose of "line break here if needed"
[11:02:19] <MikeD_> but tbh, i didn't scroll back to the statement of the problem that was solved by a "zero-width non-joiner"
[11:02:34] <MikeD_> i kinda just obsessed on that combination of words
[11:03:41] <mareosa> hi guys
[11:03:45] <mareosa> should this work ?
[11:03:47] <mareosa> $(document).ready(function() {$(".philosophyandofficecontent").css({'width': ($(".menuestruturas").width() + 'px')});});
[11:04:18] <mareosa> grab the width of .menuestruturas and set it to .philosophyandofficecontent ?
[11:06:18] <taplar> sure, if you have your parenthesies right
[11:06:36] <MikeD_> did it work?
[11:07:33] <taplar> mareosa: the {} around the width: value are not necessary
[11:07:39] <taplar> as well as the () around the width() + 'px'

[11:45:38] <dglambert> I'm trying to tie the jquery validation together with my ajax form submission
[11:46:19] <dglambert> They run independently of one another right now, ie validation happens, but so doesn't form sumission, rather then preventing submit on false validation
[11:51:30] <patrickkk> any idea why is this returning as undefined https://jsfiddle.net/j3o7osbe/
[12:03:29] <patrickkk> er nvm
[12:06:36] <Joey__> hi all. I'm getting "TypeError: $.ajax is not a function"... all answers I find online are about people having typos or errors but I can't see what is wrong with mine. JQuery is loaded as it's a jquery event... anyone? http://pastebin.com/64PcLJh1
[12:13:40] <Joey__> nevermind, seems I included the slim version of jquery.

[13:52:41] <patrickkk> that dude left :D
[13:52:47] <taplar> awww
[13:54:45] <dglambert> I'm trying to tie the jquery validation together with my ajax form submission
[13:54:55] <dglambert> They run independently of one another right now, ie validation happens, but so doesn't form sumission, rather then preventing submit on false validation
[13:55:02] <dglambert> They run independently of one another right now, ie validation happens, but so doesn't form sumission, rather then preventing submit on false validation
[13:55:18] <dglambert> I'm trying to tie the jquery validation together with my ajax form submission
[13:55:36] <dglambert> ugh sorry
[13:55:40] <dglambert> I'm being lazy
[14:00:44] <dglambert> https://gist.github.com/dglambert/a37c9080a5f563efae519ddef42529e0
[14:00:50] <dglambert> This is how I do my ajaxSubmissions
[14:01:20] <dglambert> I simply add the class ajaxSubmit to any form I want submitted via ajax
[14:05:25] <taplar> i don't see any binding for jqueryvalidate in there
[14:19:25] <dglambert> Thats because there isn't yet
[14:19:31] <dglambert> taplar,
[14:21:26] <taplar> iirc if you do the validate() on the form then it will auto validate when the user submits it.  if there is a validation error it will stop the event.  so if that is true then if you bind the handlers in the correct order then your ajax handling logic will not ever see the event if the validation finds an error
[14:22:03] <taplar> otherwise show what you have tried and show an example of the issue you have
[14:27:04] <dglambert> Ok, I am trying it this way instead
[14:27:23] <dglambert> I have swapped my post to a ajax, and am including a beforeSend
[14:27:36] <dglambert> then calling validate on the form
[14:27:43] <dglambert> which returns true/false
[14:28:01] <dglambert> Is there a more elegant way I can do it via binding?
[14:28:11] <dglambert> did you see my paste?
[14:28:46] <taplar> did you see my last statement about binding?
[14:28:57] <dglambert> yeah, I am unclear though
[14:29:11] <dglambert> so I call my submitAjaxForm in the begining of my js file
[14:29:21] <dglambert> could it be as simple as just adding a validation function first
[14:29:31] <taplar> why let it even get to that logic?
[14:29:59] <dglambert> sorry what was that in response too
[14:30:25] <taplar> "so I call my submitAjaxForm in the begining of my js file "
[14:30:33] <dglambert> ok
[14:30:48] <dglambert> what is it in your previous sentence?
[14:30:49] <taplar> it seems like your saying your wanting to validate once it gets to the ajax logic
[14:30:51] <dglambert> 'it'
[14:31:12] <dglambert> thats not my intention anyway
[14:31:24] <dglambert> I want it to happen before, hence beforeSend
[14:31:33] <taplar> calling validate inside beforeSend would indeed be in your ajax logic
[14:32:36] <dglambert> would doing something like $('form.ajaxSubmit').validate(); submitAjaxForm(); be what your suggesting?
[14:32:52] <dglambert> so validation is binding before the submissions?
[14:32:58] <taplar> yes iirc the default usage of validate
[14:33:28] <taplar> of which i'm not intimately familiar with so that could be incorrect
[14:33:34] <dglambert> I don't actually call validate right now, so I am alittle unclear on where it is triggered
[14:33:55] <dglambert> as of before trying to solve this problem, but somehow its still validating forms
[14:41:29] <BrainVirus> I am using Xibo as a digitalsignage option for our business. I can load an iframe on screen and it will allow me to manually log into the website to display the data. it will also automatically run javascript and jquery.
[14:41:56] <taplar> dglambert: https://jsfiddle.net/kef97c4k/ one option
[14:42:58] <BrainVirus> we are trying to auto log into website in the iframe using jquery. I was able to get it to work outside the iframe but not inside the iframe. Can you look at my code and help me figure out what i am missing?
[14:44:02] <taplar> are you saying you're trying to execute javascript from the parent page against the contents of the iframe?
[14:44:03] <BrainVirus> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=B1L93MEI8Q
[14:44:37] <BrainVirus> taplar, i believe so yes. (i am not a dev, i was thrown into this)
[14:44:54] <taplar> is the domain of the iframe the same as the parent page?
[14:45:21] <BrainVirus> i dont believe so
[14:45:43] <taplar> then unless the site in the iframe allows it you're going to run into CORS issues and you cannot do this with js
[14:45:59] <BrainVirus> fun....
[14:46:00] <BrainVirus> crap
[14:46:18] <shoky> you wouldn't want an outer site to load your gmail in an iframe and click stuff in it ;p
[14:46:39] <taplar> and further more, auto logging a person in like you seem to be doing in this fiddle is very smelly
[14:47:10] <taplar> username and password in hidden fields feels very dangerous
[14:47:48] <taplar> lol, even more that you can actually do that
[14:47:58] <taplar> i'm assuming the password would be set from the backend
[14:48:04] <taplar> which would mean it is stored unencrypted
[14:48:11] <taplar> i wouldn't do business with you, :)
[14:48:36] <BrainVirus> its for our companies metrics website. owner wants the metrics display on signage in office, but you have to log in. I can manually log in every time we need to restart the signage or update the content but i was trying to figure out a way i didnt have to
[14:48:40] <shoky> might not be an important login ;p
[14:48:52] <taplar> *shrug* isn't important until it is
[14:49:23] <BrainVirus> before we were using a janky setup with powerpoint and a live web plugin so i was able to get around it using powershell to type into the site.
[14:53:40] <dglambert> taplar, what if I have many rules, and want my validate call to be universal
[14:53:58] <taplar> i was just giving you a starting point man, :P
[14:54:04] <taplar> *potential
[14:54:53] <taplar> nothing says that those rules have to be statically defined
[14:55:13] <dglambert> true
[15:06:48] <patrickkk> er anyone interested in figuring this part out? :S https://jsfiddle.net/3fk04u5d/
[15:07:06] <patrickkk> PS: I cannot use class, its not unique
[15:10:26] <taplar> sure
[15:10:33] <taplar> first include jquery in the fiddle
[15:10:38] <taplar> and then take a double look at that selector
[15:10:40] <patrickkk> oh darn
[15:15:43] <patrickkk> hm enabled js, fixed the input type..
[15:15:44] <patrickkk> https://jsfiddle.net/3fk04u5d/1/
[15:16:06] <taplar> no man, look at your selector
[15:16:15] <taplar> syntatically
[15:17:20] <taplar> and you took the "" off of the value of the name, you need those
[15:17:29] <taplar> but that wasn't the original issue
[15:18:45] <patrickkk> jQuery('input[name=quantity[564]]').val('1'); <<
[15:18:51] <taplar> yup
[15:18:55] <taplar> put that "" back on
[15:19:11] <taplar> and look at that attribute selector
[15:19:24] <taplar> well actually just put the "" back on
[15:19:39] <patrickkk> oh man
[15:19:43] <patrickkk> got it lol
[15:19:46] <patrickkk> zzzz
[15:19:49] <patrickkk> thanks
[15:19:56] <taplar> you had your ending ] inside the "" originally
[15:19:59] <patrickkk> yeah
[15:26:02] <dglambert> ugh
[15:26:11] <dglambert> still struggling on finding a better way to bind validation to these forms
[15:27:49] <patrickkk> use this then. https://jqueryvalidation.org/
[15:27:55] <mmmveggies> speaking of white, the jQuery validate plugin is giving me grief
[15:27:58] <mmmveggies> which*
[15:28:16] <drej> uh
[15:28:22] <drej> why
[15:28:28] <mmmveggies> at least, don't use the "ignore" property and then expect to be able to remove or add the filter class on the fly
[15:28:35] <drej> dglambert: html5 has had validation for years now
[15:29:12] <dglambert> I am using the jquery validation
[15:29:22] <dglambert> The one that is built in with MVC asp.net
[15:34:45] <Kev-> Anyone used canvasjs before? I have a simple page that pulls data and displays a line chart. Seems to work fine, except no lines visible, but the are "there" since I get the values when I hover over the fields where the lines should be. Any tips? http://hlekkir.is/tilt/
[15:38:32] <talkJS> I've noticed that more and more people are using a semicolon before an iffe.  Why is that?
[15:38:42] <talkJS> ;(function...
[15:40:00] <systemfault> Because it won't break your code is some hippie is writing JS without semi-colons
[15:40:07] <systemfault> *if some
[15:40:49] <talkJS> oh i see
[15:44:23] <matt3o12> Hey, I have a dynamic amount of forms and each for has a among a few inputs, a button. The button as well as the fields have names describing what they do. Now, when I get a click event, how do I know the values of an input from the current form that belongs to a name? Kind of like: $(this).formValue(“id”)
[15:47:52] <taplar> click event for what?
[15:48:07] <taplar> each button in the form?
[15:48:13] <taplar> *forms
[15:51:15] <matt3o12> taplar: $(“#content”).on(“click”, “form.my-forms .delete-button”, function() { /* get value of an input with the name xxx */ }
[15:52:00] <taplar> $(this).closest('form').find('input[name="thefieldname"]')
[15:52:21] <matt3o12> Thanks :)
[15:52:50] <matt3o12> I was hoping that there was a better option and jquery somehow gives me the form directly.
[16:01:35] <GarethTheGreat> hi all, quick question - i have a resizable in jquery-ui, how do i set the size from code?
[16:03:05] <shoky> set its width/height. with .css()  or .width()/.height()
[16:03:30] <GarethTheGreat> shoky: i tried that, the other elements around it don't seem to move like they do when resizing with the mouse
[16:03:36] <GarethTheGreat> actually, one sec
[16:04:28] <woodrag> after adding a inputdatefield with i fetched with ajax the jquerydatapicker does not work.... Do i need to reinitiate the dom?
[16:04:59] <taplar> woodrag: any new elements you add to the dom that should have a plugin associated with them, you need to initialize those new elements
[16:05:04] <taplar> don't reinitialize everything
[16:05:31] <woodrag> taplar: how do i reinitialize new elements?
[16:05:50] <taplar> however your doing the initialize before
[16:06:07] <GarethTheGreat> shoky: that doesn't seem to resize the element's children
[16:06:09] <taplar> just $theNewElements.whateverinitializationmethodusedbefore()
[16:06:29] <shoky> GarethTheGreat: neither does resizable, afaik..
[16:06:50] <shoky> anyways.. make a jsfiddle
[16:07:29] <woodrag> taplar: formelements are initialized on load with $(document).ready(function()
[16:07:39] <taplar> yep
[16:07:42] <GarethTheGreat> i'll just be lazy and do the parent and child together manually
[16:08:02] <shoky> or use percentages in the child ?
[16:08:15] <shoky> then you can be laziest
[16:08:16] <woodrag> taplar: can i trigger this again without reloading the page?
[16:08:38] <dglambert> so here is my updated take on validation
[16:08:39] <dglambert> https://gist.github.com/dglambert/a37c9080a5f563efae519ddef42529e0
[16:08:40] <taplar> woodrag: that's not the initialization.  that's where your doing the first initialization
[16:08:56] <taplar> initialization is something like $(selector).datepicker() or whatever
[16:09:58] <woodrag> taplar: thats done with a class....
[16:10:28] <woodrag> taplar: and i add a field with the same class...
[16:10:44] <woodrag> taplar: but no datepicker ;-(
[16:10:46] <taplar> the point is your doing datepicker() off a jquery object containing elements
[16:10:52] <taplar> or whatever initialization method
[16:11:01] <taplar> now you have new elements
[16:11:08] <taplar> which you need to initialize
[16:11:09] <woodrag> yep
[16:11:18] <woodrag> ok, but how?
[16:13:31] <taplar> so if we extrapolate the logic, you just need a different jquery object containing the new element(s) to do the initialization on
[16:15:46] <woodrag> taplar: Thanx!
[16:15:57] <woodrag> its working....!
[16:16:01] <taplar> :)
[16:23:16] <d10magic> taplar success: function(retorno){}
[16:23:19] <d10magic> how i return 3 values
[16:23:27] <d10magic> via ajax, php
[16:23:45] <taplar> d10magic: i don't remember the context of your issue
[16:28:22] <RonaldsMazitis_> Can I make a form that has only one but hidden element

[16:28:50] <duch_kazatel> looks like you just did.
[16:28:55] <duch_kazatel> so what's the problem?
[16:28:55] <taplar> :D
[16:29:08] <taplar> you can do whatever you want with forms, so long as it is valid markup
[16:29:44] <taplar> never seen a <font> tag though
[16:29:47] <RonaldsMazitis_> duch_kazatel: my function is not sending data https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/
[16:30:02] <robertmaxrees> fiddle
[16:30:09] <robertmaxrees> update it
[16:30:11] <robertmaxrees> with markup.
[16:31:14] <RonaldsMazitis_> what markup ?
[16:31:15] <RonaldsMazitis_>  https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/1/
[16:31:24] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:31:26] <robertmaxrees> the html for the form.
[16:31:33] <RonaldsMazitis_> ok
[16:31:40] <robertmaxrees> fiddles are generally pointless if you don't maek a test case.
[16:31:45] <robertmaxrees> we keep telling you this.
[16:31:54] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/2/
[16:31:59] <robertmaxrees> also: have you tried using console.log() to see if your'e getting the value?
[16:32:29] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uxgnf9pk/3/
[16:33:25] <RonaldsMazitis_> like this ? https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/4/
[16:33:38] <robertmaxrees> sure
[16:33:42] <robertmaxrees> like i showed you in my fiddle.
[16:34:38] <RonaldsMazitis_> nothing gets into console when I press on the form
[16:34:52] <robertmaxrees> which?  the one i posted?
[16:35:37] <RonaldsMazitis_> no my function
[16:35:58] <robertmaxrees> when you "press" on it?  you're bound to submit.
[16:36:04] <robertmaxrees> without a button or something, nothing is going to happen.
[16:36:22] <RonaldsMazitis_> can't I use text as submit
[16:36:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:36:42] <taplar> not without some click binding to perform a submit
[16:37:36] <RonaldsMazitis_> so how should my form look
[16:37:58] <taplar> lol that's up to you man
[16:38:02] <robertmaxrees> you need a submit button of some kind.
[16:38:15] <robertmaxrees> have you tried reading any of the materials we've suggested?
[16:38:34] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/5/
[16:38:38] <RonaldsMazitis_> something like this?
[16:38:46] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:38:49] <robertmaxrees> look at my fiddle.
[16:39:20] <RonaldsMazitis_> but I need text as button
[16:39:39] <robertmaxrees> we're just testing here homeslice.
[16:40:53] <RonaldsMazitis_> ok, I be back, how to walk with my dog
[16:59:37] <RonaldsMazitis_> Ok, I made submit button to look like text
[16:59:45] <RonaldsMazitis_> but data is not going in
[16:59:57] <robertmaxrees> "data is not going in" where?
[17:01:28] <RonaldsMazitis_> to chatroomfunction that should insert it into db
[17:01:41] <robertmaxrees> so your php?
[17:01:57] <robertmaxrees> dump out the entire request on the php site and look to see if the format is what you think it is.
[17:02:58] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/8/
[17:03:16] <robertmaxrees> dump out the entire request on the php site and look to see if the format is what you think it is.
[17:08:32] <RonaldsMazitis_> now the form adds this to my url  ?usernamechat=Username
[17:08:46] <robertmaxrees> then you have invalid js somewhere.
[17:08:48] <robertmaxrees> check your console.
[17:08:52] <robertmaxrees> same thing as the other day.
[17:10:17] <RonaldsMazitis_> it's right here https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/8/
[17:10:59] <robertmaxrees> that error doesn't happen for me on that fiddle.
[17:14:12] <RonaldsMazitis_> in fiddle it doesn't send data to php
[17:14:20] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[17:14:30] <robertmaxrees> so you need to figure out why your site is erroring but not the fiddle.
[17:15:21] <RonaldsMazitis_> it is sending me to url
[17:15:27] <robertmaxrees> on your site?
[17:15:31] <RonaldsMazitis_> yes
[17:15:33] <patrickkk> yo
[17:15:39] <robertmaxrees> then use a breakpoint in the handler.
[17:15:44] <robertmaxrees> and make sure your selectors are all good.
[17:15:46] <RonaldsMazitis_>  file.php?usernamechat=Username
[17:16:01] <robertmaxrees> right - that means your handler is no longer working.
[17:17:54] <RonaldsMazitis_> by handler You mean that function
[17:18:09] <robertmaxrees> yes - the function you're using to handle the event.
[17:18:14] <robertmaxrees> do you have any console errors?
[17:18:38] <RonaldsMazitis_> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[17:18:41] <RonaldsMazitis_> just this one
[17:18:43] <robertmaxrees> so then fix that.
[17:18:54] <robertmaxrees> right - any js errors can break other js.
[17:19:25] <RonaldsMazitis_> it does not give me the line
[17:19:42] <robertmaxrees> then comb through your js
[17:19:57] <robertmaxrees> you had this same issue the other day.
[17:20:37] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/9/
[17:20:41] <RonaldsMazitis_> this is my whole js
[17:21:01] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[17:21:15] <robertmaxrees> looking at the console for that fiddle, i don't see any errors.
[17:25:50] <RonaldsMazitis_> me too
[17:26:00] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:27:06] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/10/
[17:27:15] <RonaldsMazitis_> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of null;
[17:27:30] <robertmaxrees> pretty obvious what the problem is.
[17:27:55] <robertmaxrees> we've been going back and forth about this for a looooong time - really starting to get the sense that you're just wanting somebody else to do it for you.
[17:28:28] <RonaldsMazitis_> You could point to problem and even fix
[17:28:39] <robertmaxrees> i've already done that for this particular problemn.
[17:28:42] <robertmaxrees> and we don't fix it for you here.
[17:29:49] <RonaldsMazitis_> function is same as the one that works
[17:29:57] <RonaldsMazitis_> I don't understand what's wrong
[17:30:09] <robertmaxrees> go do a tutorial duder.
[17:30:12] <robertmaxrees> you need to.
[17:30:24] <RonaldsMazitis_> whats wrong
[17:30:34] <robertmaxrees> we've explained it before.
[17:30:36] <RonaldsMazitis_> I understand how it works
[17:30:43] <RonaldsMazitis_> I don't understand why it doesn't
[17:30:52] <RonaldsMazitis_> right
[17:30:54] <robertmaxrees> really?
[17:31:03] <robertmaxrees> walk through the code.
[17:31:05] <robertmaxrees> try.
[17:33:15] <RonaldsMazitis_> this one works https://jsfiddle.net/sdfLpmrx/
[17:33:38] <robertmaxrees> not in that jsfiddle it doesn't.
[17:33:46] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/v6nzfob1/
[17:33:52] <RonaldsMazitis_> how is this different
[17:34:14] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:34:14] <robertmaxrees> really?
[17:34:18] <robertmaxrees> you don't see the difference?
[17:34:30] <RonaldsMazitis_> no I'm blind
[17:34:38] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:34:42] <RonaldsMazitis_> I'm really tring to
[17:34:47] <RonaldsMazitis_> trying *
[17:34:56] <robertmaxrees> they look at different elements.
[17:35:05] <robertmaxrees> you realize document.getElementById('touser').value; will error if that element doesn't exist, right?
[17:35:12] <robertmaxrees> that's what we went over the other day.
[17:35:30] <RonaldsMazitis_> yes I realize that
[17:35:39] <robertmaxrees> so that means.... what to you?
[17:35:44] <RonaldsMazitis_> but elements exist I just posted without html
[17:36:01] <robertmaxrees> but you're getting errors that say they don't.
[17:36:08] <robertmaxrees> this is why posting with the relevant html is important.
[17:36:29] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/10/
[17:36:39] <RonaldsMazitis_> this version has element
[17:36:55] <RonaldsMazitis_> <input id="usernamechat" type="hidden" name="usernamechat" value="usernamechat">
[17:37:00] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:37:14] <robertmaxrees> you're mising #textarea, #fromuser, and #touser
[17:38:12] <RonaldsMazitis_> so that line should be different   $('form').on('submit', function(e) {
[17:38:19] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:38:30] <RonaldsMazitis_> I deleted one of the functions, and tried just with one
[17:38:41] <robertmaxrees> go do a tutorial.  you're getting piecemeal information here and not getting your head around what you need and why.
[17:38:50] <robertmaxrees> and only making progress when somebody changes the code for you.
[17:39:03] <RonaldsMazitis_> it did the same thing added ?chatusername=username to url
[17:39:21] <robertmaxrees> you really need to go to a tutorial at this point duder.
[17:39:27] <RonaldsMazitis_> I did go trough tutorial
[17:39:30] <robertmaxrees> nothing i or anybody else has done has worked.
[17:39:39] <robertmaxrees> because you're getting stuck on super simple problems.
[17:39:47] <RonaldsMazitis_> then answer
[17:39:55] <robertmaxrees> i have.
[17:39:57] <robertmaxrees> multiple times.
[17:40:06] <RonaldsMazitis_> element does not exist
[17:40:10] <RonaldsMazitis_> was not answer
[17:40:14] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[17:40:19] <RonaldsMazitis_> damn how
[17:40:27] <RonaldsMazitis_> there is no errors in fiddle
[17:40:35] <RonaldsMazitis_> also it is well rendered in my browser
[17:40:51] <RonaldsMazitis_> without form element would not exist
[17:40:54] <RonaldsMazitis_> but it does
[17:41:00] <robertmaxrees> so if i go to https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/10/ and submit, i won't get an error?
[17:43:22] <RonaldsMazitis_> yeah but why
[17:43:26] <RonaldsMazitis_> I can't see
[17:43:35] <robertmaxrees> i get an error on that page if i submit.
[17:44:23] <taplar> "robertmaxrees: you realize document.getElementById('touser').value; will error if that element doesn't exist, right?"
[17:44:29] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[17:44:53] <taplar> that's the entire explination
[17:45:01] <RonaldsMazitis_> how can I keep multiple functions with submit
[17:45:11] <robertmaxrees> why would you?
[17:45:12] <RonaldsMazitis_> I delete one of them still the same thing
[17:45:22] <robertmaxrees> right, you're deleteing the one that doesn't break.
[17:45:32] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to run them in specific circumstances?
[17:47:29] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/11/
[17:47:34] <RonaldsMazitis_> still same error
[17:48:03] <RonaldsMazitis_> what is breaking in that function
[17:48:21] <robertmaxrees> that one doesn't error.
[17:48:26] <robertmaxrees> that's working.
[17:48:50] <RonaldsMazitis_> ok it doesn't error
[17:49:59] <RonaldsMazitis_> I must give multiple id's to forms
[17:50:13] <robertmaxrees> 2 things
[17:50:36] <robertmaxrees> 1 - use classes instead. 2 - what does that habe to do with bad code?
[17:52:05] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/12/
[17:52:18] <RonaldsMazitis_> classes
[17:52:20] <RonaldsMazitis_> .
[17:52:20] <RonaldsMazitis_> ?
[17:52:33] <robertmaxrees> i don';t understand why you sent that link.
[17:52:45] <robertmaxrees> the jquery tutorials talk about how to select via id and class.
[17:52:49] <robertmaxrees> as well as other basics.
[17:52:52] <robertmaxrees> please go give them a read :)
[17:53:30] <RonaldsMazitis_> I just can't remmember all the things all the time
[17:53:44] <robertmaxrees> then go back to the tutorials and look for the relevant bits and review :)
[17:53:51] <taplar> are you expecting others to fill you in for everything you can't remember?
[17:53:55] <robertmaxrees> it's a skill you'll need to acquire
[17:54:03] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/14/
[17:54:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, feel free to go fiund a freelancer to help you.
[17:54:28] <taplar> fiund = find/fund ?  lol
[17:54:32] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:54:35] <robertmaxrees> sure why not.
[17:55:00] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ i dunno what to tell you at this point.  we've been super helpful but it really feels like you're ignoring our advice.
[17:55:40] <RonaldsMazitis_> it still sends me to ?usernamechat=username
[17:55:47] <taplar> like right now
[17:55:47] <robertmaxrees> because you have console errors.
[17:55:53] <robertmaxrees> this is a great example.
[17:55:54] <RonaldsMazitis_> I don't have
[17:55:59] <robertmaxrees> we've covered why you keep getting these issues.
[17:56:16] <robertmaxrees> your js is broken so it'll send you to a new page.
[17:56:40] <RonaldsMazitis_> where
[17:56:48] <robertmaxrees> we've told you alead.
[17:56:50] <robertmaxrees> *already.
[17:57:01] <taplar> look back through the chat log.  it's all there
[17:57:10] <robertmaxrees> you're more than welcome to review the chat log.  please go through and and check out tutorials.
[17:57:20] <RonaldsMazitis_> no You did ignore me, and said element doesn't exist
[17:57:26] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[17:57:29] <robertmaxrees> we explained that already.
[17:57:44] <RonaldsMazitis_> how to make it exist
[17:57:45] <robertmaxrees> if the element with that ID is not on the page, you will get an error in your js and it won't work.
[17:58:00] <robertmaxrees> you're kidding, right?
[17:58:14] <RonaldsMazitis_> how to make it exist more than it exist now
[17:58:17] <RonaldsMazitis_> it's in html
[17:58:22] <RonaldsMazitis_> how can it not exist
[17:58:23] <robertmaxrees> not in the fiddles you've sent us.
[17:58:41] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/14/
[17:58:48] <RonaldsMazitis_> 	<input id="usernamechat" type="hidden" name="usernamechat" value="usernamechat">
[17:59:02] <robertmaxrees> there's no #textarea, #fromuser, or #touser.
[17:59:05] <robertmaxrees> as i said earlier.
[17:59:54] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/15/
[18:21:22] <RonaldsMazitis_> hello, I'm real sorry if I'm disturbing anyone
[18:21:41] <RonaldsMazitis_> I just think my element is selected as class correctly
[18:21:44] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chatbox").on('submit', function(e) {
[18:22:05] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/17/ fiddle does not have errors
[18:23:04] <robertmaxrees> try again
[18:23:45] <taplar> http://fixingthesejquery.com
[18:24:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:24:09] <RonaldsMazitis_> :)
[18:25:05] <shoky> that fiddle works fine..?
[18:25:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[18:25:57] <shoky> sorry, i see there's a history to this
[18:26:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah... heh
[18:28:39] <Aquazi> anybody here?
[18:28:52] <taplar> few peeps
[18:28:54] <robertmaxrees> quite a few people - as you've seen already :)
[18:28:55] <RonaldsMazitis_> it shows 0 when I do console.log($(".chatbox").length);
[18:29:05] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ not in that fiddle.
[18:29:40] <Aquazi> I have a question that might sound odd
[18:29:46] <Aquazi> But, how can I check my page symmetry?
[18:29:53] <robertmaxrees> "page symmetry"?
[18:30:01] <Aquazi> Like, some elements do not appear to be perfectly symmetrical ecc
[18:30:07] <Aquazi> So I'd like to have some numerical value
[18:30:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:30:20] <Aquazi> Oh it's a generic html question
[18:30:24] <Aquazi> Not really a jquery one
[18:30:33] <taplar> uh, you could possibly get their offset() on teh page
[18:30:37] <robertmaxrees> still not really making sense lol
[18:31:14] <Aquazi> I'll make an example, this is a page I'm making for fuck sake just to see bootstrap and implement some js stuff
[18:31:16] <Aquazi> http://bootstraptut-aquazi.c9users.io/views/home4.html
[18:31:49] <Aquazi> I'm not totally sure that the login on right and brand on left have the same offset from border
[18:31:50] <RonaldsMazitis_> my element is loading with this function https://jsfiddle.net/v6nzfob1/2/
[18:32:04] <RonaldsMazitis_> maybe that's the cause of it's not existence
[18:32:07] <Aquazi> So I want to check their symmetry and position
[18:32:17] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ then you want a delegated listener.
[18:32:30] <robertmaxrees> Aquazi your dev tools can help you there.
[18:32:39] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you have questions about element alignment
[18:32:41] <Aquazi> how, trying to see everything
[18:32:48] <Aquazi> in dev tools
[18:33:36] <RonaldsMazitis_> can web be off the symetry lol, sounds funny
[18:33:43] <robertmaxrees> back up - do you want to see if it's different, or fix the problem?
[18:34:57] <taplar> yeah, they're not symmetrical
[18:35:03] <Aquazi> I just want to know if the distance from the border of both is the same, seems so, but I wanted to know if there was a scientifical/geometrical way to do so
[18:35:15] <taplar> the login has some extra space on the rhs
[18:35:58] <RonaldsMazitis_> okay, I did load without setinterval, element should be there
[18:36:32] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ nope.
[18:36:36] <robertmaxrees> use a deegated handler.
[18:36:42] <robertmaxrees> that'll fix the problem.
[18:37:15] <taplar> well, i say that, but the navbar-collapse is centered and the two things are on the far left and right of it, so... maybe they are
[18:37:21] <taplar> :s
[18:37:23] <taplar> i hate float
[18:37:47] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://api.jquery.com/delegate/ ?
[18:37:59] <robertmaxrees> .on)_
[18:38:00] <robertmaxrees> * ()
[18:38:23] <Aquazi> taplar, that's the point, maybe ^^, thought there was some dev plugin to check that stuff
[18:38:55] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ RonaldsMazitis_
[18:39:13] <taplar> Aquazi: there may be, or maybe chrome would better display it
[18:39:20] <taplar> but FF isn't showing me the offsets of items
[18:40:30] <RonaldsMazitis_> but console.log($(".chatbox").length);  is giving zero
[18:40:37] <RonaldsMazitis_> how handler will change that
[18:40:48] <robertmaxrees> read the documentation.
[18:40:58] <robertmaxrees> the learning center article answers that very question :)
[18:41:44] <RonaldsMazitis_> $( "#list" ).on( "click", "a", function( event ) { - I have no idea what click means
[18:41:51] <RonaldsMazitis_> a
[18:41:54] <RonaldsMazitis_> for example
[18:42:11] <taplar> Aquazi: ($(window).width() - $('#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1').width()) / 2 == $('#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1').offset().left
[18:42:19] <taplar> ^ is true, so if those values are right, :D
[18:42:38] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ if you read the actual article, is explains everything.
[18:42:41] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty clear.
[18:43:02] <Aquazi> wait, where did you put that?
[18:43:07] <taplar> in the console
[18:43:52] <RonaldsMazitis_> no it's really not, Your native is english?
[18:44:22] <robertmaxrees> "Notice how we have moved the a part from the selector to the second parameter position of the .on() method. This second, selector parameter tells the handler to listen for the specified event, and when it hears it, check to see if the triggering element for that event matches the second parameter."
[18:44:37] <robertmaxrees> it literally covers the thing you askd about.
[18:45:12] <Aquazi> isn't the part on the left 0, taplar?
[18:45:24] <taplar> of what?
[18:45:30] <Aquazi> of the equation
[18:45:33] <taplar> nope
[18:45:42] <taplar> not in my browser
[18:45:52] <taplar> why would it be?
[18:46:27] <Aquazi> oh right, I had another navbar which was taking the entire width before, thank you, that was a smart solution
[18:46:36] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chatbox").on('submit', 'usernamechat', function(e) {
[18:46:56] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ you said the chatbox doesn't exist on pageload, right?
[18:47:12] <robertmaxrees> so as the article tells you, you'll need to bind to a parent element that exists on pageload.
[18:47:12] <RonaldsMazitis_> yes
[18:47:18] <RonaldsMazitis_> oh
[18:47:25] <robertmaxrees> it's not vague.
[18:47:28] <robertmaxrees> i promise it's a good read.
[18:47:38] <taplar> RonaldsMazitis_: what is your native language?
[18:47:42] <RonaldsMazitis_> class="user"
[18:47:49] <RonaldsMazitis_> <div
[18:47:53] <RonaldsMazitis_> Latvian
[18:48:07] <robertmaxrees> so then bind to that element and pass the selector for the form as the second arg.
[18:48:47] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chatbox").on('submit', 'user', function(e) {
[18:48:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:48:53] <robertmaxrees> agaon
[18:49:01] <robertmaxrees> "so then bind to that element and pass the selector for the form as the second arg."
[18:49:12] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chatbox").on('user','submit' function(e) {
[18:49:20] <robertmaxrees> 'submit' is the event.
[18:49:29] <robertmaxrees> leave that where it was.
[18:49:36] <robertmaxrees> .chatbox needs to be the second argument, not user.
[18:49:44] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chatbox").on('submit', 'chatbox', function(e) {
[18:49:54] <robertmaxrees> now you need to replace $('.chatbox') with the correct element.
[18:50:09] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".user").on('submit', 'chatbox', function(e) {
[18:50:13] <taplar> i guess google moved their translator stuff into chrome and off of the web.  blah
[18:50:16] <robertmaxrees> it's a christmas miracle.
[18:51:57] <RonaldsMazitis_> user class also does not exist on page load
[18:52:03] <RonaldsMazitis_> must go higher?
[18:52:04] <robertmaxrees> then go further up.
[18:52:07] <robertmaxrees> as the article explains.
[18:53:20] <RonaldsMazitis_> console.log($(".outputusers").length); still 0
[18:53:25] <taplar> ah, they just make it kinda silly to use
[18:53:27] <taplar> https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&tl=lv&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.jquery.com%2Fon&edit-text=&act=url
[18:53:36] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ you didn't even try :)
[18:54:08] <robertmaxrees> for the last time - you need to bind on a parent element that exists on pageload.
[18:54:12] <RonaldsMazitis_> chat_body is 1
[18:54:48] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chat_body").on('submit', 'user', function(e) {
[18:55:02] <robertmaxrees> i thought the form was .chatbox
[18:55:09] <taplar> or better yet: https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=en&tl=lv&u=http%3A%2F%2Flearn.jquery.com%2F
[18:55:17] <taplar> ^learn.jquery.com translated
[18:55:23] <robertmaxrees> haha taplar++
[18:56:27] <RonaldsMazitis_> ?usernamechat=username gets loaded into url
[18:56:42] <robertmaxrees> then the handler isn't properly binding.
[18:56:45] <RonaldsMazitis_> that thing is unreadable
[18:57:12] <RonaldsMazitis_> every form of word is incorrect in google translate
[18:57:25] <taplar> *shrug* i'm trying
[18:57:58] <taplar> though, for you to know that the form is incorrect, would mean you know the word they mean
[18:58:02] <taplar> so...
[18:58:05] <taplar> lol
[18:59:01] <sshaginyan> Does anyone know of any frameworks/libraries that do relational database schema design on the client-side (maybe server-side as well)? So I'm looking for a framework where the user can create tables, join tables, make primary keys, (Whatever mysql workbench does) etc...
[18:59:13] <RonaldsMazitis_> I kinda know every word in english aswell, it's just they way they laid out
[18:59:26] <robertmaxrees> what about the way they laid it out?
[18:59:32] <robertmaxrees> because it's pretty understandable.
[18:59:43] <robertmaxrees> it seems like a lot of reading, byt it really isn't.
[18:59:51] <taplar> sshaginyan: you looking for a flow chart type of thing?
[18:59:53] <RonaldsMazitis_> so what's incorrect with that .on handler
[18:59:57] <robertmaxrees> also: it's kind of unreasonable to expect other people to walk you through with baby steps.
[18:59:59] <sshaginyan> @taplar yes
[19:00:00] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chat_body").on('submit', 'chatbox', function(e) {
[19:00:04] <robertmaxrees> i don't know - i can't see your page RonaldsMazitis_
[19:00:15] <robertmaxrees> i can tell you you'remissing a period for that chatbox selector.
[19:00:22] <taplar> sshaginyan: i'm not aware of a js plugin for something like that
[19:00:22] <sshaginyan> @taplar Well I'm looking to model a relational database schema in the browser
[19:00:34] <shoky> sshaginyan no idea if it's what you mean, but i just used this for some project  https://dbdesigner.net
[19:00:42] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/20/
[19:00:58] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:01:12] <shoky> i didn't use it to create SQL but i see it can do that too
[19:01:13] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ you know what i'm going to tell you.  this is getting pretty ridiculous.
[19:01:30] <sshaginyan> @shoky That's exactly what I  need, but I want to use it in my application
[19:01:42] <shoky> sshaginyan oh, no idea then sry ;p
[19:02:27] <RonaldsMazitis_> I'm sorry, I'm really trying to make that handler right
[19:02:46] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ not enough html to be able to help.  like i've said every other time.
[19:03:02] <robertmaxrees> you're also using a bad selector - you're missing the period in front of chatbox.
[19:03:12] <taplar> ^ lol, i was fixing to say that
[19:03:28] <PlanC> RonaldsMazitis_, why aren't you using websockets for the chat?
[19:03:32] <taplar> any who my happy ass is going home and getting a burger, ^_^.  later all
[19:03:37] <robertmaxrees> PlanC he doesn
[19:03:43] <robertmaxrees> *he doesn't even know how to select elements.
[19:03:46] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/21/
[19:03:50] <robertmaxrees> websockets are going to be WAY over his head.
[19:04:01] <PlanC> robertmaxrees, ah that explains why he's been asking for help in this channel for a couple of days
[19:04:11] <RonaldsMazitis_> PlanC whats websockets
[19:04:15] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ last time i'll say it - you're missing the period in front of chatbox for that selector.
[19:04:53] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chat_body").on('submit','user', 'chatbox', function(e) {
[19:04:54] <PlanC> RonaldsMazitis_, it's basically a direct connection to the server so you can push messages to the client instead of having the client send requests to the server checking for updates
[19:05:18] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ you have to be trolling at this point.
[19:05:21] <RonaldsMazitis_> for irc?
[19:05:30] <robertmaxrees> i've told you exactly what the problem is three times.
[19:05:31] <RonaldsMazitis_> I'm not trolling
[19:05:40] <RonaldsMazitis_> element does not exist
[19:05:42] <RonaldsMazitis_> yeah
[19:05:54] <robertmaxrees> so fix the selector using the advice i've given.
[19:06:51] <PlanC> RonaldsMazitis_, read up on javascript and jquery a bit more mate
[19:06:58] <RonaldsMazitis_> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[19:06:59] <PlanC> RonaldsMazitis_, also use your browser's console to get the errors
[19:07:06] <RonaldsMazitis_> there is only one a
[19:07:19] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ you need to also read about selectors.
[19:07:22] <RonaldsMazitis_> I did element is not DOM
[19:07:29] <robertmaxrees> and you want .chatbox
[19:07:59] <robertmaxrees> not sure how you got what you got out of what i said.
[19:08:35] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chat_body").on('submit','chatbox', function(e) {
[19:08:44] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:11:23] <RonaldsMazitis_>  We have now attached a single submit event listener to our chatbox
[19:11:33] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:11:35] <robertmaxrees> on chat_body
[19:11:47] <robertmaxrees> that listens for submit events emitting from .chatbox
[19:12:01] <RonaldsMazitis_> ok, yes
[19:21:08] <RonaldsMazitis_> I just can't get those elements to exist
[19:21:15] <robertmaxrees> they'll exist in the handler.
[19:21:23] <robertmaxrees> after the ajax call has finished.
[19:22:55] <RonaldsMazitis_> thats sweet but I can't make that function to find them
[19:23:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:24:24] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/22/
[19:24:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:24:57] <robertmaxrees> dude
[19:26:02] <robertmaxrees> i've already told you exactly what your problem is with that.  i dunno what to do at this point.
[19:26:33] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chat_body").on('submit','chatbox', function(e) { again
[19:26:41] <robertmaxrees> already answered.
[19:26:44] <RonaldsMazitis_> this line is correct
[19:26:46] <RonaldsMazitis_> ?
[19:26:47] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:26:48] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[19:26:59] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder.
[19:27:32] <RonaldsMazitis_> You are trying to teach me, when I need just a help with line
[19:28:01] <RonaldsMazitis_> I have awfull lack
[19:29:25] <PlanC> don't want to sound harsh but I couldn't agree more
[19:47:31] <RonaldsMazitis_> It's 2 in night, sorry again but is this only source about .on handler https://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[19:47:45] <robertmaxrees> no it's not.
[19:47:52] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:48:09] <robertmaxrees> particularly api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[19:58:10] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/26/ this allerts correct variable username
[19:58:46] <RonaldsMazitis_> ah
[19:58:55] <RonaldsMazitis_> and data was sent to database too
[19:59:02] <RonaldsMazitis_> great
[19:59:44] <RonaldsMazitis_> now I can keep moving with my pseudo code
[20:00:12] <taplar> what was wrong with the previous code?
[20:00:53] <taplar> you've kinda avoided learning what was wrong
[20:02:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:09:51] <taplar> the comment in the html of https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/23/ reflects a clear misunderstanding of what the problem is, and how the dom works, or what it is
[20:14:44] <RonaldsMazitis_> chat_body has only one username thought
[20:15:00] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:15:04] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[20:17:01] <RonaldsMazitis_> I can't get into smaller parts
[20:17:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:18:53] <taplar> I swear Rod Serling is going to pop in here at some point
[20:27:25] <PlanC> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzlG28B-R8Y
[20:27:50] <RonaldsMazitis_> Any time one of our anchor tags is clicked, a click event is fired for that anchor.
[20:28:11] <RonaldsMazitis_> why that does not happen with my form
[20:28:26] <robertmaxrees> it fires lots of events.
[20:28:38] <robertmaxrees> including click, submit, focus, blur, etc.
[20:28:46] <RonaldsMazitis_> triggering each of its parent click event handlers:
[20:29:01] <RonaldsMazitis_> what does that mean
[20:29:16] <taplar> it means your avoiding learning why the previous code did not work
[20:29:49] <RonaldsMazitis_> You mean this line $(".chat_body").on('submit', 'chatbox', function(e) {
[20:29:55] <taplar> yup
[20:30:02] <RonaldsMazitis_> tell me then
[20:30:08] <robertmaxrees> what are you asking?
[20:30:26] <taplar> robert already told you why that line doesn't work
[20:30:40] <taplar> 'chatbox' isn't a thing
[20:30:43] <RonaldsMazitis_> YES
[20:30:50] <RonaldsMazitis_> how to make it a thing
[20:30:56] <robertmaxrees> i already told you how.
[20:31:00] <robertmaxrees> at least 5 times.
[20:31:10] <taplar> what IS 'chatbox'?  what is that string supossed to do?
[20:31:10] <RonaldsMazitis_> seriously
[20:31:20] <robertmaxrees> seriously
[20:32:05] <RonaldsMazitis_> when form tag called chatbox is clicked event is fired for that anchor, and then bubbles up the DOM tree, triggering each of its parent click event handlers:
[20:32:13] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:32:15] <robertmaxrees> no no no.
[20:32:23] <robertmaxrees> when the form is submitted.
[20:32:27] <robertmaxrees> not clicked.
[20:32:34] <robertmaxrees> and chatbox is not a valid selector.
[20:32:39] <robertmaxrees> it's a class, right?
[20:32:44] <RonaldsMazitis_> yes
[20:32:50] <taplar> how are you targeting classes in yoru css?
[20:32:55] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[20:32:58] <RonaldsMazitis_> .class
[20:33:02] <taplar> so...
[20:33:06] <robertmaxrees> so what's wrong with what you have?
[20:33:18] <RonaldsMazitis_> $(".chat_body").on('submit', '.chatbox', function(e) {
[20:33:30] <robertmaxrees> did you try?
[20:35:07] <RonaldsMazitis_> again every element is just one username
[20:35:15] <taplar> literally has nothing to do with this
[20:36:07] <taplar> and is avoiding robert's question
[20:36:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah i don't understand what that has to do with literally anyhing heh.
[20:38:25] <RonaldsMazitis_> sorry, I don't try to avoid questions, I just don't get how to do this correctly
[20:38:34] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're having right now?
[20:39:05] <RonaldsMazitis_> alert(usernamechat); fires up only one first username of the list
[20:39:22] <robertmaxrees> so you have multiple chat boxes, yes?
[20:39:22] <taplar> ids are unique
[20:39:32] <robertmaxrees> you're using IDs, which you can only use once per on a page.
[20:39:38] <robertmaxrees> you want a class and to learn about context.
[20:39:46] <robertmaxrees> both of which are explained quite well in the docs.
[20:42:55] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/27/
[20:43:06] <RonaldsMazitis_> once per page?
[20:43:14] <taplar> yes, btw fix your css plz
[20:43:35] <taplar> my ocd is killing me
[20:44:02] <RonaldsMazitis_> this differs in every chatbox <input id="usernamechat" type="hidden" name="usernamechat" value="'.$usernamechat.'">
[20:44:16] <taplar> that id CANNOT repeat
[20:44:24] <RonaldsMazitis_> oh
[20:44:33] <taplar> it's a -unique- id
[20:44:41] <taplar> just like your drivers license
[20:44:55] <taplar> can't identify anything if it goes to multiple things
[20:45:29] <taplar> classes, however, can repeat.
[20:45:35] <taplar> and are meant for that purpose
[20:46:54] <taplar> to further enforce this, the method you are using is 'getElementById'
[20:46:59] <taplar> singular
[20:47:10] <taplar> where as notice 'getElementsByClassName'
[20:49:41] <RonaldsMazitis_> now it alerts undefined
[20:50:20] <taplar> that's ruff
[20:50:26] <robertmaxrees> use jquery fwiw
[20:50:32] <robertmaxrees> instead of native js.
[20:54:42] <RonaldsMazitis_> var usernamechat = $( ".usernamechat" ).val();
[20:54:51] <RonaldsMazitis_> and alert pops out undefined
[20:55:07] <taplar> did you change it to be a class on the markup?
[20:55:55] <taplar> you've yet to link an updated fiddle so, just going off of that line, my magic 8 ball says no
[20:56:14] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:56:25] <RonaldsMazitis_> ok now it's again first username of the list
[20:56:30] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:56:34] <robertmaxrees> so now you need to change it.
[20:56:40] <robertmaxrees> so it's relative to the submitted form.
[20:59:13] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/inside-event-handling-function/
[21:00:12] <taplar> or http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/#using-the-triggering-element
[21:00:45] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/28/
[21:01:33] <taplar> what's wrong with ln 9, and you have nothing in there yet to deal with the submitted form
[21:02:06] <taplar> and the css block still has a syntax error
[21:04:26] <RonaldsMazitis_> .text_button
[21:04:28] <RonaldsMazitis_> where
[21:04:52] <taplar> what does that have to do with line 9?
[21:05:46] <RonaldsMazitis_> if ( usernamechat.is( "" ) ) {
[21:05:46] <RonaldsMazitis_>         usernamechat.attr( "" );
[21:05:46] <RonaldsMazitis_>     }
[21:05:56] <taplar> that's not at all what is in that fiddle
[21:05:57] <RonaldsMazitis_> how do I use this
[21:06:10] <robertmaxrees> holy wowzer lol
[21:06:32] <RonaldsMazitis_> https://jsfiddle.net/uxgnf9pk/29/
[21:06:44] <taplar> again
[21:06:51] <taplar> still trying to find by id
[21:07:59] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis_ we've all been extremely patient and helpful.
[21:08:06] <robertmaxrees> but you're not really giving us much to work with at this point.
[21:08:17] <RonaldsMazitis_>  how do I trigger next id
[21:08:28] <taplar> ok, your not trying now.  i'm done
[21:08:40] <RonaldsMazitis_> WHAT
[21:08:49] <RonaldsMazitis_> 9 line form closes
[21:09:03] <robertmaxrees> just stop yo
[21:09:19] <RonaldsMazitis_> I need form to use correct data
[21:09:39] <robertmaxrees> you're just having other people tell you what to type.  you're not actually learning anything at this point.
[21:09:59] <RonaldsMazitis_> working code block would help
[21:10:07] <robertmaxrees> that's not how this channel works.
[21:10:08] <robertmaxrees> sorry! :)
[21:10:17] <RonaldsMazitis_> it's not like I'm building this from level of assambler
[21:10:41] <robertmaxrees> we've been trying dude.
[21:10:46] <RonaldsMazitis_> I am trying
[21:10:47] <robertmaxrees> you're not giving us much to work with.
[21:10:51] <RonaldsMazitis_> what

[21:14:03] <taplar> man... if I was a guy who enjoyed liquer
