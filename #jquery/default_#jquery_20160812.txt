[02:47:05] <MarkTheMark> how do i check if the csrf is getting the token using the console print? https://dpaste.de/83iG
[03:02:52] <Cork> Kartagis: if csrf is getting?
[03:02:57] <Cork> opps
[03:03:01] <Cork> *MarkTheMark:
[03:03:11] <Cork> MarkTheMark: what are you asking?
[03:03:45] <Kartagis> no harm done
[03:04:05] <Cork> not even sure how autocomplete made that lookup...
[03:10:18] <Uhkis> yeah, blame the autocomplete, not your typo ;)
[05:07:42] <yaeykay> Hi guys I would like to ask how to log the error in ajax request http://laravel.io/bin/E357m
[05:07:48] <yaeykay> Getting undefined
[05:16:17] <Cork> yaeykay: error is old and depricated
[05:16:22] <Cork> use .fail(function
[05:16:45] <Cork> (and removed in 3.x)
[05:18:18] <yaeykay> I'm using 1.11.3
[05:21:28] <yaeykay> .fail(function(xhr, status, errors) {
[05:21:28] <yaeykay>                 console.log(errors);
[05:21:28] <yaeykay>             });
[05:21:43] <yaeykay> Still getting Unexpected end of JSON input(â€¦)
[05:24:21] <yaeykay> Just want to catch the error message
[05:24:35] <yaeykay> So i can present it to the view
[05:26:33] <Cork> yaeykay: ok make a fiddle with the full context of the problem
[05:26:40] <Cork> cause that should work
[05:34:02] <yaeykay> @Cork https://jsfiddle.net/w72ddofb/2/
[05:34:34] <Cork> hmm
[05:34:46] <Cork> yaeykay: is the call cross domain?
[05:35:05] <yaeykay> Yup
[05:35:14] <Cork> so it uses jsonp?
[05:35:50] <Cork> or is it through cors?
[05:36:20] <yaeykay> cors @Cork
[05:37:26] <Cork> yaeykay: and if you remove line 17 and 18 does it still fail to catch the error?
[05:37:42] <Cork> ex add a console.log('call failed')
[05:37:46] <Cork> instead
[05:38:33] <yaeykay> Yup. I use console.log(xhr) And it does log the xhr
[05:38:56] <Cork> yaeykay: ok, so what you want to do is catch the parsing error from the .fail callback
[05:39:08] <Cork> wrap the JSON.parse(xhr.responseText) in a try catch
[05:39:15] <Cork> cause it is what crashes
[05:40:09] <yaeykay> Just want to get the error messages
[05:40:21] <yaeykay> example name field is required
[05:40:26] <yaeykay> and so on
[05:41:14] <Cork> feels like i'm missing what you're trying to do... >_>
[05:42:45] <yaeykay> I mean I need to catch server errors
[05:43:01] <yaeykay> Like invalid email address
[05:43:21] <Cork> are you sure the server responds with 4xx errors for that?
[05:46:05] <sp1rs> want  Aug 2  type of format in moment js  , not getting that format
[05:46:56] <yaeykay> Yes
[05:48:37] <Cork> sp1rs: .format('MMM D') should get you that
[05:48:55] <yaeykay> @Cork status: 200 but still going the the .error() callback?
[05:49:06] <Cork> yaeykay: no
[05:49:48] <Cork> only 4xx and 5xx triggers the fail callback (also again move away from .error, it is depricated)
[05:51:50] <sp1rs> Cork: yes thx
[05:54:06] <yaeykay> @Cork I have the .fail() and .success() callback both logging "fail", and "success" and in my network tab getting status 200 but it log "fail"
[05:54:29] <Cork> yaeykay: same goes with success, it is called .done now days
[05:54:44] <Cork> and .success is removed in 3.x
[05:55:08] <Cork> yaeykay: ya, cause the parsing of the response fails, cause it isn't valid json
[05:55:23] <Cork> so the server sends a response, but parsing of it fails
[05:55:31] <Cork> that ends up in the .fail callback
[05:55:50] <yaeykay> So line 10 is the culprit? https://jsfiddle.net/w72ddofb/2/
[05:56:06] <Cork> no
[05:56:14] <Cork> that is the transmitted data
[05:56:42] <Cork> ex. if the server sends application/json, but the content isn't valid json
[05:56:47] <Cork> you end up in the .fail
[05:58:27] <yaeykay> I see
[05:59:17] <yaeykay> Using laravel and response from Postman(chrome extension) [ "The email has already been taken" ]
[06:00:04] <yaeykay> How can I present the array response from the server?
[06:00:40] <Cork> yaeykay: the exact way you are, if the content from the server is correctly formatted
[06:01:04] <Cork> but i can't tell you what the problem is as that isn't included in the fiddle
[06:01:29] <Cork> (both the .done callback and the content you want to handle is missing)
[06:32:10] <w1|dcard> Hello, how can I set a cookie for jquery ui dialog so a people that already saw the dialog don't see it again?
[06:33:44] <Uhkis> w1|dcard: use localstorage instead
[06:35:39] <w1|dcard> I see, I was to add $.cookie('showDialog', 'false', { expires: 1 }); // set the cookie, with expiry after 1 day
[06:35:39] <w1|dcard>     }
[06:39:37] <Cork> w1|dcard: $.cookie only exists if you load that plugin
[06:39:41] <Cork> but ya, that should work
[06:42:30] <w1|dcard> I already have that loaded, but the dialog don't shows up
[06:42:53] <Cork> w1|dcard: you have to write code that checks the cookie
[06:42:59] <Cork> it won't react automatically
[06:43:43] <w1|dcard> https://jsfiddle.net/y0fmpzkm/
[06:44:13] <Cork> w1|dcard: ya, that sets the cookie, but nothing checks it
[06:44:53] <w1|dcard> my skills to code aren't so great, what's missing?
[06:45:01] <Cork> uh, everything?
[06:45:43] <Cork> for the cookie to have any effect you have to check for it
[06:45:52] <Cork> else it's just pointless
[06:49:49] <rfc19> Hello, I'm finding that my JQuery is only working in Chrome and not IE. What could be causing this? I've tried debugging using 'Developer Tools' but can't see anything interesting.
[06:50:07] <Cork> rfc19: that question is way WAY to generic
[06:50:17] <Cork> you need to define not working
[06:50:37] <rfc19> Cork: True... And I do apologise, but it's basically _everything_
[06:50:52] <Cork> rfc19: ok, 1. does the lib load in ie?
[06:51:02] <Cork> 2. does jQuery exist in ie?
[06:51:03] <rfc19> I have a button, for example (.btn) with a 'click' event attached, and that does not trigger.
[06:51:14] <Cork> rfc19: don't jump to step 20
[06:51:32] <rfc19> Cork: fair call. I'm assuming I can see if the lib loads in the 'Network' tab?
[06:51:39] <Cork> ya
[06:51:49] <Cork> then in the console type jQuery and see what you get
[06:54:44] <rfc19> Cork: I get a 200 OK with the lib, so all good there. 'jQuery' in the console outputs some information as well
[06:55:23] <Cork> rfc19: ok, are you using the ready wrapper correctly?
[06:55:43] <Cork> hmm, actually more importantly; have you ran the page through w3c validator?
[06:56:02] <Cork> https://validator.w3.org/ <-- make sure it validates here
[06:56:18] <rfc19> Let me do that now. I made some updates over the last few days - everything was working in every browser before I made updates.
[06:57:35] <Uhkis> rfc19: did you update jquery from 1.x to 2.x?
[06:58:04] <w1|dcard> https://jsfiddle.net/y0fmpzkm/1/
[06:58:06] <w1|dcard> still not working
[06:58:17] <w1|dcard> now it don't apper
[06:58:20] <rfc19> Uhkis: I'm fairly sure I didn't
[07:03:14] <rfc19> Cork: while it isn't 100% valid, I don't see what could be causing an issue.
[07:03:43] <Cork> rfc19: make sure you don't have any missing close tags or things like that
[07:03:52] <Cork> that is the most important part
[07:04:26] <Cork> rfc19: next is to run the selector and make sure it actually finds anything
[07:04:35] <Cork> console.log($('the-selector').length)
[07:04:40] <rfc19> Cork: 'No p element in scope but a p end tag seen.' I'm seeing that
[07:04:55] <Cork> that is bad ya
[07:05:48] <rfc19> That's fixed
[07:07:03] <rfc19> Cork: in the console I executed --> $('.btn').length(); and got "Function expected"
[07:07:19] <Cork> length isn't a function
[07:07:49] <Cork> also run it at the same place you run the event binding
[07:07:55] <rfc19> Ahh
[07:07:59] <rfc19> Ok, I got output now
[07:10:00] <rfc19> Cork: Can I pm you the link?
[07:10:18] <Cork> sure
[07:10:31] <Cork> though note i don't have ie at hand
[07:11:03] <rfc19> It doesn't work in Safari either, if that's any consolation. I don't have Safari
[07:11:15] <Cork> i have neither :)
[07:12:43] <Cork> rfc19: so what handler is the problem?
[07:13:09] <rfc19> Cork: that button there where you buy tickets.
[07:13:17] <Cork> selector
[07:13:25] <Cork> not graphical reference :)
[07:13:59] <Cork> uh...
[07:14:08] <Cork> rfc19: you're using jquery 2.1.4
[07:14:09] <rfc19> #show-form
[07:14:15] <Cork> that doesn't work in ie < 9
[07:14:27] <rfc19> I'm running this in IE11
[07:14:55] <Cork> fair
[07:15:39] <rfc19> I just changed it to 1.12.4 to be sure -- no luck
[07:16:40] <Cork> rfc19: might be that elements cover the button in ie
[07:17:03] <Cork> i've had that happen as ie works quite differently in how it positions transparent elements
[07:17:21] <Cork> so use ie's inspector so make sure it is clickable
[07:17:48] <rfc19> Right. But I run --> $('#show-form').click() <-- in the IE console, nothing happens. I'd assume this would force the click regardless
[07:18:08] <Cork> rfc19: also your csp blocks inline scropts so....
[07:18:13] <Cork> how is this working exactly?
[07:18:36] <Cork> Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'none'".
[07:18:52] <rfc19> How do I replicate that error?
[07:19:03] <Cork> just open the developer console and load the page
[07:19:11] <Cork> it is right in there when i opened it
[07:19:21] <rfc19> in IE?
[07:19:25] <Cork> no
[07:19:32] <Cork> like i said, i don't have access to ie
[07:19:40] <rfc19> What are you using, sorry?
[07:19:44] <rfc19> I don't see that in Chrome
[07:19:58] <Cork> ah, no sorry that was on my end
[07:20:08] <Cork> (interesting didn't know it used that...)
[07:20:40] <Cork> so ya, make sure the button is really clickable in ie
[07:20:51] <Cork> that is the only help i can give you
[07:21:01] <rfc19> It's not just that object that's not working, though.
[07:21:08] <Cork> (i'm not in the mood to start a vm to fiddle with ie)
[07:21:11] <rfc19> "Gift Vouchers Available" is also meant to be clickable - no luck
[07:21:17] <rfc19> that's ok :)
[07:21:21] <Cork> might be the same reason
[07:21:45] <rfc19> Can you maybe point me in the right direction on how I can determine if the object is clickable or not?
[07:22:37] <Cork> i did
[07:22:54] <Cork> "<Cork> so use ie's inspector so make sure it is clickable"
[07:23:47] <rfc19> Ok, I'll tyr that. Thank you. Another thing is, I add a 'console.log('hello');' at the top of everything, and nothing is displayed in the console on IE.
[07:23:55] <rfc19> I don't think it's a clicking thing, in that case.
[07:24:15] <Cork> rfc19: you need to have the console open for console.log to exist in ie
[07:24:24] <rfc19> It is open
[07:24:32] <Cork> then it is time to check for errors
[07:25:14] <rfc19> I do see an error. SCRIPT1006: Expected ')'
[07:25:26] <Cork> there you go
[07:25:30] <Cork> find it and fix it
[07:25:39] <Cork> prob a trailing comma
[07:25:47] <Cork> ie loves to choke on those
[07:25:50] <rfc19> function updatePrice(tix,eligible = false) { <-- On that function. I can't see what's wrong with it
[07:25:58] <Cork> right
[07:26:02] <Cork> ie doesn't support es6
[07:26:07] <Cork> you need to use es5
[07:26:39] <Cork> and argument defaults is part of es6
[07:27:15] <rfc19> So, would I just do: var eligible = false; straight after the open curly brace?
[07:27:32] <rfc19> Or do I need to parse 'false' every time
[07:27:49] <Cork> function(tix, eligible) { eligible ||= false; /* rest */ }
[07:28:15] <Cork> or actually as you want to default to false
[07:28:18] <Cork> just ignore it
[07:28:25] <Cork> cause undefined is falsy
[07:28:55] <Cork> function t(tix, eligible) { if(eligible) {} } t(1) === t(1, false)
[07:30:06] <rfc19> Cork.... yes that was it!
[07:31:13] <rfc19> thank you
[07:31:26] <Cork> rfc19: never accept errors
[07:31:30] <Cork> validation or js errors
[07:31:45] <Cork> those list should always be empty, else debuggin becomes a hell
[07:34:07] <rfc19> Cork: that's a fair point.
[07:40:35] <cariveri> hi. what does the CORSE error mean: preflight channel did not succeed? something worng with my ajax call?
[07:43:21] <Cork> cariveri: if you do a cross domain post it needs to make a preflight connection to the server
[07:43:34] <Cork> cariveri: and the server needs to answer with a response allowing the post request
[07:43:41] <Cork> else the request will be blocked by the browser
[07:43:54] <cariveri> Im trying with a get request actually
[07:44:08] <Cork> you shouldn't have preflight for get calls
[07:44:17] <Cork> it should only require the cors header
[07:45:40] <cariveri> Cork: is there a pastebin of your liking to show you what I got?
[07:46:04] <Cork> cariveri: as this is just headers anything works for me
[07:50:21] <cariveri> Cork: pastebin.com/6m9VeKm9
[07:50:46] <Cork> cariveri: that isn't going to help
[07:50:54] <Cork> cariveri: the server has to set hte cors header
[07:51:01] <Cork> else the entire feature would be pointless
[07:51:16] <Cork> you can't control this from js
[07:51:47] <cariveri> that should be done. it's couchdb server and cors enabled. but you say the js sided code is alright then?
[07:52:04] <Cork> cariveri: remove the header part
[07:52:11] <Cork> that has nothing to do in the request
[07:52:25] <Cork> those are response headers and should not be in there
[07:52:56] <cariveri> Cork: all of "headers" ?
[07:53:04] <Cork> cariveri: for js there is no difference with and without cross domain except it has a doman and jquery requres corssDomain
[07:53:09] <Cork> headers: { <--
[07:53:19] <Cork> those headers in there are response headers not request headers
[07:53:22] <Cork> so shouldn't be in there
[07:53:30] <Cork> (they are pointless)
[07:53:44] <Cork> the server has to send those
[07:55:03] <Cork> cariveri: also if the server works correctly you don't need var json = $.parseJSON(e);
[07:55:12] <Cork> that is only needed when you talk with broken servers
[08:03:15] <cariveri> IC. ok. for now deleting the headers section did the trick. it works now when requesting from the very same machine. however not when requesting from the network.
[08:24:12] <jose3_> can I do this: $.each( data, function( key, val, index ) ? How come it says index is undefined?
[08:41:25] <fuchstronaut> jose3_: because the callback will get 2 params, key and val
[08:52:54] <jose3_> fuchstronaut: Thanks
[08:53:31] <fuchstronaut> jose3_: what do you mean by 'index'? the key is something like an index
[08:54:01] <jose3_> yeah heh, i just realized that
[08:54:53] <jose3_> well i wanted an actual number
[08:55:52] <taplar> Object.keys(data).forEach(function(key, index){ .. });
[08:57:29] <taplar> index for an object is strange though.  it's not an array
[09:38:07] <jose3_> okay how about this ?
[09:38:23] <jose3_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c5f17f88b9ea7a215a4d3c8c92129861
[09:39:16] <taplar> ya, you don't have to do the done
[09:39:50] <Cork> or better yet use .then and .done and stip the callback in the getJSON
[09:40:23] <Cork> $.getJSON().then(function(result) { return result.sweeps; }).done(function(sweeps) {});
[09:40:52] <Cork> jose3_: sweeps in done will be the same as result in the getJSON callback
[09:40:58] <Cork> (in your code)
[09:41:02] <jose3_> yikeees
[09:41:03] <jose3_> hold on
[09:42:48] <jose3_> wowsers
[09:43:07] <jose3_> yall some smart cats
[09:44:59] <taplar> i think he just called us pu....
[09:45:12] <Cork> lol
[09:45:18] <jose3_> pu ?
[09:45:28] <Cork> pu... :D
[09:45:30] <jose3_> oh
[09:45:36] <jose3_> hah gotchya
[09:45:41] <jose3_> i did not
[09:46:40] <jose3_> are you guys working right now?
[09:46:47] <Cork> yes
[09:46:58] <taplar> always
[09:47:19] <jose3_> like on solo projects? or at a company? or for yourselves?
[09:47:42] <taplar> company
[09:47:44] <Cork> i'm migrating a site from rails 4 to 5... fun business...
[09:47:55] <jose3_> you are using rails 5 already?
[09:47:59] <Cork> ya
[09:48:08] <Cork> and they changed the entire test suite syntax...
[09:48:08] <jose3_> I wish I worked with rails that is my dream job
[09:48:10] <Cork> FUN
[09:48:13] <jose3_> heh
[09:48:42] <Cork> ya, and we have like ~4500 tests...
[09:48:44] <Cork> >_<
[09:48:51] <jose3_> thats some good coverage
[09:48:53] <taplar> good deal
[09:49:07] <Cork> luckely much of it can be fixed with regex
[09:49:09] <Cork> but... not all
[09:49:22] <Cork> well it is a BIG site
[09:49:22] <jose3_> well at least you have something to do
[09:49:25] <jose3_> or something like that
[09:49:27] <Cork> heh
[09:49:39] <Cork> ya, i've been swamped for about half a year so ...
[09:49:43] <Cork> no problem with what to do
[09:50:02] <jose3_> I have an interveiw for a junior rails job next week
[09:50:12] <jose3_> that I am well underqualified for
[09:50:16] <Cork> we are quick on the gun this time cause we learned from a previous time where the move was from 2.3 to 3
[09:50:21] <Cork> and we didn't move quickly
[09:50:27] <Cork> and later it just wasn't possible
[09:50:38] <jose3_> so what, you rebuilt it ?
[09:50:40] <Cork> so we got stuck (and had to rewite the entire site)
[09:50:42] <Cork> yes
[09:50:49] <Cork> took 1.5 years :/
[09:51:04] <taplar> a chance to encur new technical debt
[09:51:09] <Cork> and we had to maintain the old site along side
[09:51:31] <Cork> was weird to maintain rails 2.3 until 1014
[09:51:50] <Cork> way WAY after security patches stopped getting released
[09:52:03] <Cork> don't ever want to do that again...
[09:52:16] <jose3_> holy hell
[09:52:44] <jose3_> that is quite a project
[09:52:48] <jose3_> how big is the team?
[09:52:56] <jose3_> and how many users does the site have?
[09:52:56] <Cork> 3 ppl
[09:52:59] <jose3_> yikes
[09:53:16] <Cork> well it is for wholesail
[09:53:22] <Cork> so it is for resellers
[09:54:12] <Cork> well actually now days it is 4 as we have a dedicated designer now days
[09:55:00] <taplar> we got 6 devs, and 1 UXer who is pairing with me currently
[09:55:38] <jose3_> how ong have you guys been working?
[09:55:45] <taplar> 8yrs
[09:55:52] <jose3_> comp sci background?
[09:55:58] <Cork> for this company since 2007
[09:56:04] <taplar> csc/mth
[09:56:19] <Cork> (well actually since before this company, i came with one of the bosses)
[09:56:29] <taplar> i've forgotten the mth part
[09:57:26] <lilalinux> Why does inArray return -1 although the element clearly exists and is of same type? https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/de-de/#B065qXGF1fLCz9;912C76CD-5A96-476A-9D67-F46F2F86A28D
[09:57:29] <jose3_> wow so you guys are pretty experienced
[09:57:42] <taplar> in an ever changing world, who is experienced? ;)
[09:58:05] <jose3_> and wise  8 )
[09:58:18] <Cork> lilalinux: uh... are we suppose to make anything out of that image?
[09:58:26] <taplar> lilalinux: that variable is a string
[09:58:27] <Cork> lilalinux: if you have a question make a jsfiddle
[09:58:44] <taplar> or i'm looking at this wrong
[09:59:09] <taplar> oh, or it's cause of the case difference
[09:59:14] <taplar> one is all caps
[09:59:24] <Cork> ya, its case sensitive
[09:59:25] <lilalinux> oh
[09:59:31] <lilalinux> thank you
[09:59:40] <Cork> but ya, next time no images please...
[09:59:41] <lilalinux> didn't notice that :-/
[10:00:21] <lilalinux> Cork: in this case I wanted to show the runtime values and setting up a jsfiddle likely had messed with the datatypes
[10:01:14] <Cork> lilalinux: also if you get confused with inArray just check arr[i] == search
[10:01:55] <lilalinux> Cork: it was hard to debug, as I concentrated on the syntax
[10:02:03] <lilalinux> I should have checked the data more thoroughly
[10:59:22] <z1haze_work> look at this craziness http://dpaste.com/370P3FG
[10:59:45] <z1haze_work> my bosses see no issue here
[11:00:30] <taplar> good times
[11:01:55] <z1haze_work> and its a website of a multi billion dollar company
[11:02:03] <z1haze_work> and we let this happen
[11:03:47] <slax0r> z1haze_work: I work for an ecommerce company, sadly, our biggest clients shop, has passwords in the database, in cleartext
[11:04:01] <slax0r> the bigger they are, the less they care about such stuff, until stuff happens
[11:04:53] <slax0r> unfortunatelly when CC data is involved, and something does happens, such companies tend to disappear
[11:05:18] <taplar> as they should
[11:09:25] <z1haze_work> thats nuts - yea we dont even touch the database
[11:09:41] <z1haze_work> its all wrapped up somewhere offsite - just use an api
[11:12:04] <Cork> z1haze_work: and this is in production?
[11:12:16] <Cork> i beat that in development, but ya...
[11:14:23] <z1haze_work> yea production
[11:14:29] <Cork> ouch
[11:14:45] <w1|dcard> hello, what's wrong with this? https://jsfiddle.net/Lofj23a1/ I added the cookie and now it don't show
[11:14:48] <z1haze_work> http://us.puma.com/
[11:15:26] <taplar> w1|dcard: incorrect way to include scripts in jsfiddle, one sec
[11:16:11] <z1haze_work> gross, i know
[11:16:46] <taplar> "/js/jquery.cookies.js" is a relative address what wouldn't exist on jsfiddle
[11:17:36] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lofj23a1/1/
[11:18:32] <taplar> RHS should be LHS :/
[11:18:54] <taplar> bas-akwards, story of my life
[11:19:28] <taplar> other than that, what are you trying to do?
[11:22:55] <w1|dcard> It's commented (with double slash) because otherwise it doesn't work
[11:23:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lofj23a1/2/
[11:23:14] <w1|dcard> needed to put it working in a few minutes I'm closing the office to holidays
[11:23:43] <w1|dcard> and I needed a message to inform but with the cookie
[11:28:13] <w1|dcard> I'm not a expert coder and I'm trying to help some help
[11:29:10] <taplar> jsfiddle may be doing something to monkey with cookies.
[11:29:19] <taplar> this plugin doesn't seem to be creating them
[11:33:56] <w1|dcard> i just pasted there, in my website it works that way (commented) but if i'm trying to set the cookie nothing shows
[11:36:03] <taplar> 'it' works unless you set the cookie?
[11:41:25] <w1|dcard> taplar, the way i paste it works but if I uncommented (to set the cookie working) it doesn't work
[11:42:11] <taplar> ok, so have you tried putting a break point before the if and seeing what's going on?
[11:43:35] <w1|dcard> I'm trying to set cookies so the dialog don't show everytime anyone visit the page
[11:43:43] <w1|dcard> and making it expire in 1 day
[11:43:54] <taplar> i understand that.  i'm asking have you debugged it
[11:44:47] <taplar> are you familiar with your browser debugger tools?
[11:47:40] <w1|dcard> Uncaught ReferenceError: Cookies is not defined (anonymous function) @ (index):32
[11:47:42] <arc_> ur a browser debugger tool
[11:47:45] <arc_> hi robertmaxrees
[11:47:52] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[11:48:03] <taplar> arc_: i thought i was just a tool
[11:48:12] <arc_> o u did did u
[11:48:24] <taplar> w1|dcard: so that would seem to say the plugin is not being included properly
[11:48:49] <taplar> if your using the original plugin that you were showing in the fiddle it would be the $.cookie
[11:49:03] <w1|dcard> this website was already cookies
[11:49:10] <taplar> however that github repo suggested using the newer version one, which would be the different include, which changed it to Cookies
[11:49:47] <taplar> ok, so either you are trying to use Cookies before the script include, or you are having an issue with the load of it
[11:49:53] <taplar> your network tab will tell you about the latter
[11:50:51] <w1|dcard> 169ms
[11:50:58] <w1|dcard> i don't know indeed what is causing this
[11:51:11] <robertmaxrees> w1|dcard is your code after the plugin include?
[11:51:18] <taplar> so it is showing a 200 or a 304?
[11:51:35] <w1|dcard> Status Code:304 Not Modified
[11:51:52] <taplar> ok, so to roberts question
[11:55:03] <robertmaxrees> yes, to my question!
[11:57:27] <z1haze_work> anyone ever had an issue where the form method="post" was being removed from the rendered page?
[11:57:46] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[11:58:17] <taplar> rendered how/with what?
[12:03:32] * taplar sings rihanna watch me burn
[12:04:29] <w1|dcard> it's loaded after the code
[12:04:41] <w1|dcard> it loads correctly
[12:04:44] <taplar> so there's your issue
[12:04:59] <z1haze_work> i have a form that im putting on a page - and it has method="post" but the source of the code when i view the page.. the method is stripped out of the form
[12:05:02] <taplar> the code that needs to use it has to appear afterwards
[12:05:05] <w1|dcard> after no, before I misspelled wrongly
[12:05:49] <taplar> so it's the plugin include, and then your code
[12:05:54] <Uhkis> so spelled correctly? :D
[12:06:44] <z1haze_work> hwo can this happen
[12:06:56] <z1haze_work> or does it have to be something server side thats doing it
[12:07:16] <taplar> you said your putting it on the page.  with js?
[12:08:18] <z1haze_work> no just raw html
[12:08:37] <taplar> ok, so check the network request to see if it's there or not
[12:09:17] <w1|dcard> Yes it's calling the jquery.cookies then in the head is the code, it has other cookies working on the website
[12:09:32] <w1|dcard> the jquery ui dialog is working without the cookies
[12:09:36] <z1haze_work> its makinga guest request because the method is being stripped out
[12:09:39] <z1haze_work> get**
[12:09:54] <z1haze_work> i just dont understand how it can remove the method from the page like that
[12:09:55] <WhirledPress> Anybody know of a good position class that lets me determine relative positions of elements outside and inside of an element's scope?
[12:10:00] <shoky> z1haze1: if it's there in view-source  (but not in inspect elements) then some js code has removed it
[12:10:10] <z1haze_work> its not in either
[12:10:20] <shoky> if it's not in view-source then your server is not outputting it
[12:10:25] <shoky> then check your server.
[12:10:44] <z1haze_work> figured
[12:10:56] <taplar> w1|dcard: i'd suggest dropping a break point on the conditional then and seeing what's going on.
[12:11:15] <taplar> which goes back to me asking if you are familiar with your browser debugging tools
[12:11:31] <w1|dcard> ok i'll see it later thanks for your help guys
[12:11:40] <taplar> ...
[12:12:33] <taplar> time for lunch!
[12:18:59] <taplar_food> robertmaxrees: btw i was playing around with vscode.  kinda wish there was a grails plugin
[12:19:41] <robertmaxrees> hah
[12:37:38] <theery> Using autocomplete, how come when I click on the input, it fires the lookup and onSelect events? https://gist.github.com/macmartine/43c8a077bd6efecf7e5ab7eb7be0aa77
[12:38:17] <theery> I don't want it to fire unless the input value changes. As it is now, Once I click on the input, the form fires and the input loses focus
[12:39:32] <robertmaxrees> which plugin are you using?
[12:39:59] <robertmaxrees> because the autocomplete widget doesn't have a lookup option afaik.
[12:40:09] <robertmaxrees> or onselect.
[12:42:41] <taplar_food> side note, the get handler could be condensed
[13:08:24] <devslash> in my click event, I do this: console.log($("li",this).html()); which returns a href="http://www.google.com" class="selected">My Menu Item</a> I want to extract just the href src. how do I do that
[13:09:08] <devslash> oops theres supposed to be a < before the a in "a href="
[13:09:17] <taplar> $('li .selected').attr(
[13:09:21] <taplar> $('li .selected').attr('href')
[13:09:30] <taplar> $('li .selected', this).attr('href')
[13:09:48] <devslash> 'nice thanks
[13:39:10] <anth0ny> has anyone ever experienced an issue where there was a discrepency between what jQuery reported an element's style to be VS what the element's style actually was on the DOM?
[13:39:40] <taplar> how are you checking the DOM?
[13:39:52] <anth0ny> I'm experiencing a strange bug where an element's position can't seem to be moved. jQuery reports the position to be one value (the correct value), but the DOM is reporting it to be something else
[13:40:09] <anth0ny> taplar: looking at the returned value from the selector: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/897290/17631345/ff2afb52-6080-11e6-9744-2087048e08af.png
[13:41:10] <taplar> how is it positioned?
[13:41:32] <anth0ny> taplar: setting the element's position via .css() or .attr('style', ...) both fail to change the position on the DOM.
[13:41:39] <anth0ny> taplar: it's currently positioned via .css()
[13:41:59] <anth0ny> eg .css({top: 123, left: 987})
[13:42:41] <taplar> i mean, what is the 'position' style attribute set as
[13:43:52] <anth0ny> taplar: absolute
[13:43:53] <taplar> i'm wondering if attr('style') is computing the values rather than just giving you what is in that attribute
[13:44:15] <taplar> humm, dunno
[13:44:25] <anth0ny> yeah, it's all very peculiar
[13:45:34] <taplar> your setting it with css() ?
[13:45:54] <anth0ny> correct, using .attr has the same affect
[13:46:21] <taplar> what if you do css('top') to get the set value
[13:47:18] <TimLoal> anyone arround to clarify what i'm doing wrong attaching a function to an element? https://jsfiddle.net/fu2yctog/11/
[13:47:21] <anth0ny> taplar : it returns what it _should_ be (basically what .css set it to be)
[13:47:24] <TimLoal> i get an error on line 372/173 when i'm trying to call $('#ul' + rEvent.target.id).innerHTML = $(".el-treeview:first")._buildItem(lfakeResponse); _buildItem is not a function
[13:49:02] <taplar> anth0ny: the only thing i can think of is css() is updating the styles in the dom for the element and not updating the attribute on the element
[13:50:11] <anth0ny> taplar: and do you know of any way around that?
[13:50:13] <taplar> TimLoal: if you console.log( jQuery.fn._buildItem ); what do you get?
[13:50:36] <taplar> if you set with css, use css to look it up
[13:50:49] <taplar> it's not really an issue if attributes do not match the dom
[13:50:57] <taplar> their primary purpose is so you can load the dom initially
[13:52:28] <_TWG_> I'm needing to add a telephone input mask.  Do I need to mess with a large jquery input mask or is it easy to just add that for what I'm wanting to do?
[13:53:24] <TimLoal> tap when i get undefined from jQuery.fn._buildItem
[13:53:35] <TimLoal> its a function in a widget
[13:53:46] <taplar> TimLoal: that would mean it's not a method on the fn namespace
[13:54:33] <taplar> anth0ny: alternatively you could set it with attr('style', '...') but your going to have to keep track of what all was on it
[13:54:44] <taplar> personally i'd just use css, :P
[13:54:53] <robertmaxrees> TimLoal you're confused about how the widget factory works :) the name of the widget is the one that you call against the element.
[13:54:56] <anth0ny> taplar: re: "if you set with css, use css to look it up", but I'm not actually concerned with what .css() reports, I'm concerned with where it appears on the DOM
[13:55:15] <robertmaxrees> you then access the various methods by passing those as strings to that base one.
[13:55:27] <TimLoal> taplar how would i add it to the fn namespace?
[13:55:48] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/ - look down at the section titled "Instance" for more info if you want to use the jqui factory.
[13:56:01] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you just kind of want a plain jquery plugin.
[13:56:42] <taplar> i can't speak to widgets.  never messed with them much
[13:56:46] <taplar> creating, that is
[13:56:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah, he's learning the jqui widget factory.
[13:57:46] <TimLoal> i presume i could just add it to the fn namespace, even if its a hack it will work for now, will i know better
[13:58:12] <robertmaxrees> TimLoal but then you'll lose out on all the state management you'll get through the jqui factory.
[13:58:15] <robertmaxrees> tradeoffs and all that.
[14:07:28] <anth0ny> Is there any way to watch an element for a change in property and then identify what code changed that property?
[14:07:56] <taplar> debuggers
[14:08:13] * taplar is trying to get on a debugger kick
[14:08:27] <robertmaxrees> debuggers are the truth.
[14:10:59] <AwkwardCough> if you really want to debug I heard Raid was pretty good
[14:11:08] <robertmaxrees> BOOM
[14:11:23] * taplar finger snaps
[14:13:58] <anth0ny> taplar: ah, just noticed the DOM Breakpoints, this may do it!
[14:21:22] <devslash> I have a DIV with an iframe child in it. I dynamically load the iframe source when the user clicks on a menu item. This part works but when you scroll in the iframe it overflows vertically past the div. is there a way to prevent this behavior
[14:36:17] <Jani_H> would anyone have a few minutes to help me understand if some jquery code regarding tab buttons on a page?  Currently the first tab always opens when the page is loaded but I would like to modify it so that a different tab could be opened (perhaps based upon a variable passed in the url)?
[14:38:16] <taplar> you using jqueryui tabs?
[14:39:01] <Jani_H> taplar:  I'm not sure :(
[14:39:55] <taplar> if you are, http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-active should let you change the default open tab
[14:40:02] <taplar> i believe
[14:40:14] <Jani_H> taplar:  I'm using TWiki which is sorta like a collaborative platform / Wiki that creates the "code" based on an existing "Plugin"
[14:40:57] <Jani_H> taplar:  I've made a jsfiddle with what I believe is the jquery code - https://jsfiddle.net/hstdwswr/1/
[14:41:39] <Jani_H> taplar: i don't have enough knowledge to replicate the entire page but the "tab" approach can be seen here (http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Sandbox/JQueryPluginExamples) at the bottom of the page.
[14:41:44] <robertmaxrees> looks like bootstrap.
[14:42:21] <robertmaxrees> oh, nope.  that's their own internal setup.
[14:42:39] <robertmaxrees> http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/VarJQTABPANE
[14:42:49] <robertmaxrees> looks like you hand it a select= parameter
[14:43:00] <taplar> ah, nice
[14:43:59] <Jani_H> robertmaxrees:  oh geez, I've spent a few hours trying to even learn how all this content was being generated and you figured it out in under 2 minutes :)
[14:44:47] <Jani_H> thanks a lot for having a look.  i guess sometimes as a novice it's not uncommon to venture off into an entirely wrong / complicated direction :)
[14:45:01] <robertmaxrees> nah it's all good :)
[15:44:32] <strigga> https://jsfiddle.net/788cuf5z/1/ <-- must be a simple one. Why dont I get the alert when pressing a key in the textarea?
[15:44:55] <robertmaxrees> you don't have jquery included in your fiddle.
[15:45:13] <robertmaxrees> <textarea name="whatsnew" class="url_check" /></textarea is redundant - you're self-closing the tag.
[15:45:27] <robertmaxrees> so do <textarea name="whatsnew" class="url_check" ></textarea>
[15:45:58] <robertmaxrees> just do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/788cuf5z/5/ for maximum fun anr profit :)
[15:47:16] <strigga> robertmaxrees: Thanks. The "/" did the trick
[15:47:29] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:47:33] <robertmaxrees> you mean killing the "/"
[15:49:31] <strigga> jup
[15:49:48] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[15:51:15] <strigga> robertmaxrees: thanks for the fiddle.
[15:51:19] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[16:22:23] <Yepp> is Selectize.js' load function same as jQuery's native load function? https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/api.md
[16:22:31] <Yepp> I need to do promises
[16:23:43] <robertmaxrees> could always look to see what it returns
[16:24:23] <devslash> I have a DIV with an iframe child in it. I dynamically load the iframe source when the user clicks on a menu item. This part works but when you scroll in the iframe it overflows vertically past the div. is there a way to prevent this behavior I wish I could create a jsfiddle but because of iframe cross domain restrictions, it wont work if i creat ea JSFiddle
[16:24:44] <robertmaxrees> devslash so you want to limit the iframe height?
[16:24:49] <devslash> yes
[16:24:53] <devslash> width and height
[16:24:55] <robertmaxrees> you can set a max-height on it.
[16:24:57] <robertmaxrees> and max-width
[16:25:02] <robertmaxrees> or just a static width and height
[16:25:04] <devslash> so its always a "child" of the parent div
[16:25:13] <devslash> ok ill try that thanks
[16:26:07] <devslash> can i set the c ss for the iframe to inherit
[16:26:11] <devslash> i mean
[16:26:30] <robertmaxrees> you mean the contents of the iframe?
[16:26:31] <devslash> can I set the width and height properties in CSS to inherit so it it fill up the parent frame
[16:26:33] <devslash> yes
[16:26:46] <devslash> I dont want the iframe to overlap the parent div
[16:26:48] <robertmaxrees> you can't touch the contents of the iframe via css.
[16:26:53] <robertmaxrees> you can only modify the iframe itself.
[16:27:01] <devslash> im not trying to modify the contents
[16:27:14] <robertmaxrees> so just the iframe?
[16:27:22] <devslash> I just want to set the width and height of the iframe and however it renders inside of the iframe is how it is
[16:27:25] <devslash> basically yes
[16:27:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:27:32] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[16:28:03] <devslash> ok
[16:28:19] <robertmaxrees> or just set the height and width attributes.
[16:28:23] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe
[16:34:48] <devslash> its still happening
[16:34:59] <robertmaxrees> can you share a fiddle, even if it doesn't function?
[16:35:08] <robertmaxrees> really hard to help wiuth code i can't see.
[16:35:15] <devslash> the iframe content is overflowing vertically past its parent div
[16:35:20] <devslash> yea sure one sec
[16:35:26] <robertmaxrees> and you have overflow: hidden; set?]
[16:35:35] <devslash> on the iframw
[16:35:41] <robertmaxrees> the parent div.
[16:35:48] <robertmaxrees> the iframe doesn't need that.
[16:35:50] <devslash> i did that on the parent div too
[16:38:16] <devslash> https://jsfiddle.net/06bozfke/
[16:38:42] <robertmaxrees> so it's the height, right?
[16:38:54] <devslash> actually both width and height are an issue
[16:39:08] <devslash> I want to prevent the iframe contents from overlapping the parent div
[16:39:28] <devslash> some of the menu items are ok and some are too wide vertically and horizontally
[16:39:38] <beshoo> i am using dropzone.js script , i want to use a costome progress-bar for the previews , the problem           <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-success" data-dz-uploadprogress></div>
[16:39:38] <beshoo> has no id to reach , and if i used class name , this mean i will reach all elemnts
[16:39:41] <beshoo> please advice
[16:40:15] <robertmaxrees> devslash so none of the js here is relevant?
[16:40:21] <robertmaxrees> this is purely a css question?
[16:40:26] <devslash> no it is
[16:40:35] <devslash> i load the iframe contents via jquery
[16:40:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:40:43] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything fwiw.
[16:40:43] <devslash> but i think its mostly css related
[16:41:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/06bozfke/1/ this still has your problem, right?
[16:41:18] <devslash> did you change any of the css
[16:41:21] <robertmaxrees> ah nvm i see what's up.
[16:41:23] <robertmaxrees> and no, i didn't.
[16:41:30] <devslash> ok so you just removed the JS
[16:41:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:41:39] <devslash> well asince you removed it, it wont load the content
[16:41:44] <robertmaxrees> remember the iframe doesn't work.
[16:41:46] <devslash> it has to be done dynamically
[16:41:51] <devslash> i know
[16:42:00] <robertmaxrees> *remembered.
[16:42:02] <devslash> on my local intranet it obviously does...
[16:42:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to find something to put in there ot make this work for me.
[16:42:39] <robertmaxrees> also your js has an error.
[16:42:43] <devslash> its hard with that iframe cross domain restriction
[16:42:57] <robertmaxrees> not everybody blocks those fwiw.
[16:43:12] <devslash> yea but in my experience most sites do
[16:43:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:43:18] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[16:43:22] <robertmaxrees> lemme play with this.
[16:43:28] <devslash> ok thanks
[16:43:51] <robertmaxrees> i might also ask your question in #css btw
[16:44:06] <robertmaxrees> since this really is a css question.
[16:50:24] <devslash> i think ive come closer to a solution
[16:50:31] <robertmaxrees> did you ask in #css?
[16:50:35] <devslash> yes
[16:50:38] <devslash> but no response
[16:53:27] <devslash> i fixed it
[16:53:34] <robertmaxrees> your positioning was on the wrong element.
[16:53:43] <devslash> yea
[16:53:56] <robertmaxrees> you wanted that on the #parendTive
[16:54:00] <robertmaxrees> *#parentDiv
[16:54:04] <devslash> I assigned an id to the parent div and set te css on it liek this: overflow:hidden !important;
[16:54:04] <devslash> 	position: absolute;
[16:54:04] <devslash> 	left: 405px;
[16:54:06] <robertmaxrees> sorry, took me a minute to fix things.
[16:54:10] <devslash> no problem
[16:54:16] <robertmaxrees> and then remove that positioning from the iframe.
[16:54:18] <devslash> you helped me to fix it
[16:54:19] <robertmaxrees> and all that jazz.
[16:54:35] <devslash> I still had to do this on the iframe: overflow:hidden !important;
[16:54:35] <devslash> 	position: absolute;
[16:54:35] <robertmaxrees> what's with this iframe dealio btw?
[16:54:46] <robertmaxrees> iframe doesn't need absolute positioning.
[16:54:46] <devslash> well because Im loading external content
[16:54:48] <robertmaxrees> the parent div does.
[16:55:03] <devslash> it does or it doesnt render correctly for me
[16:55:06] <robertmaxrees> any reason  you're not just using an ajax-stlye setup?
[16:55:06] <devslash> both do
[16:55:21] <devslash> arent there cross domain restrictions with that ?
[16:55:37] <robertmaxrees> same rules that apply for iframes.
[16:55:49] <robertmaxrees> do you own the server you're pulling from?
[16:56:08] <devslash> well yes on all but one of the sites
[16:56:25] <robertmaxrees> why not just expose the site data then?  and then render that out?
[16:56:31] <robertmaxrees> instead of messing around with clunky iframes.
[16:56:35] <devslash> no idea how to do that
[16:56:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:56:50] <robertmaxrees> i might look into how to do that.
[16:56:52] <devslash> iframes arent the best solution
[16:57:01] <devslash> but theyre relatively easier
[16:57:16] <robertmaxrees> but far less efficient.
[16:57:21] <robertmaxrees> since you have to load an entire other site.
[16:57:26] <robertmaxrees> and are way less flexible.
[16:57:44] <devslash> my only issue now is with the one menu that points to an external site and wont load because of cross domain
[16:58:27] <robertmaxrees> heh, for that you need to proxy through your own server.
[16:58:37] <devslash> umm ok...
[16:58:56] <robertmaxrees> what?
[16:59:08] <devslash> lol I dunno how to do tjhat either
[16:59:18] <robertmaxrees> heh, gonna have to learn ;)
[16:59:25] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw, lots of things may or may not break in the process.
[18:55:47] <quang> hi
[18:56:16] <quang> hi
[18:56:22] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[18:56:25] <quang> is the iffe pattern as good as import export?
[18:56:35] <robertmaxrees> solves a different problem.
[18:56:39] <quang> i cant find someone talking about pros and cons
[18:56:42] <quang> realy?
[18:56:46] <robertmaxrees> iife just gives you scope.
[18:56:50] <quang> i thought they were module loading
[18:56:54] <robertmaxrees> iifes aren't.
[18:57:02] <robertmaxrees> iifes are just a way to get a one-time-use scope.
[18:57:08] <robertmaxrees> import export is for modules.
[18:57:26] <quang> i just say a video where u can get pubilc and private methods using iffe
[18:57:36] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[18:57:39] <quang> and he was saying iffe is a module pattern
[18:57:50] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[18:57:56] <robertmaxrees> here's the article you should read on IIFEs.
[18:58:35] <robertmaxrees> the original purpose was for giving you a one-time-use scope.  if you're looking for a good module pattern, that's a different discussion :
[18:58:50] <quang> wait
[18:58:53] <robertmaxrees> I'd go for native ES2015 modules of that's what you'd like, but it depends on your environmenbt.
[18:59:25] <quang> isnt iffe like prototypes?
[18:59:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:59:37] <robertmaxrees> prototypes are how javascript handles inheritance.
[18:59:45] <robertmaxrees> iife is for scope.
[19:00:02] <robertmaxrees> check out that article (which shows you how you can use iifes for a sort of module pattern fwiw).  also check out ##javascript for me.
[19:00:04] <robertmaxrees> *more
[19:00:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:00:35] <quang> wait
[19:00:47] <quang> in 3s6 is class  sugar for iffe
[19:01:21] <quang> es6 rather
[19:15:40] <z1haze> heya
[19:21:26] <motaka2> hello, where can I find a responsive menu that supports rtl , does that have anything to do with bootstrap ?
[19:22:23] <z1haze> anyone use backbone, i cant figure out this routing thing..
[19:22:55] <chandu20> z1haze: i don't use backbone,But every one know about MVC
[19:23:13] <z1haze> when i use the backbone router for a link it appends the entire href include http:// to the address bar instead of just the pathname specified - also the more links i click it just keeps appending to the url instead of replacing it
[19:23:21] <z1haze> i wouldnt say everyone knows about mvc
[19:24:35] <chandu20> z1haze: MVC, is basic and easyDesign pattern
[19:24:58] <z1haze> sure, but that doesnt mean everyone knows it
[19:26:00] <chandu20> z1haze: what you mean by appenging to url?
[19:26:08] <chandu20> *appending
[19:26:17] <z1haze> i end up with something like /admin/admin/admin/analytics/analytics/analytics/stats after a while
[19:26:28] <z1haze> its bizzare
[19:26:37] <chandu20> z1haze: it's not routing to url that you want?
[19:27:05] <z1haze> no it does, but when i click a route i expect it to put that route in the addres sbar, and if click another route it should replace my current route with the new one
[19:27:12] <z1haze> but intstead it seems to be appending
[19:27:15] <z1haze> appending*
[19:27:28] <z1haze> err, i guess i didnt typo that
[19:32:04] <motaka2> z1haze: ?
[19:33:50] <z1haze> motaka2, ?
[19:34:04] <motaka2> can you please answer my question ?
[19:34:17] <z1haze> i dont know the answer or I would have answered
[19:36:29] <motaka2> z1haze: Why no one is here?
[19:36:42] <z1haze> its late man
[19:36:43] <z1haze> I dont know
[19:49:19] <WhirledPress> I have a collection of thumbnails that I need to enlarge from their position to take up the screen when clicked.The problem is that the thunmbnails are in one container and the featured image is in another. How do i manage relative positions?
[20:32:16] <TimLoal> anyone arround to clarify what i'm doing wrong attaching a function to an element? https://jsfiddle.net/fu2yctog/11/
[20:32:20] <TimLoal> i get an error on line 372/173 when i'm trying to call $('#ul' + rEvent.target.id).innerHTML = $(".el-treeview:first")._buildItem(lfakeResponse); _buildItem is not a function
[20:32:25] <TimLoal> attaching it in the constructor with this.element._buildItem = this._buildItem;
[21:47:54] <alexander25> hi everyone on an ajax:success its not possible to redirect to a subdomain?
[21:48:16] <alexander25> im on mydomain.io and would like to redirect to app.mydomain.io ( login form is on the mydomain.io )
[21:48:40] <alexander25> so everything works fine but if i redirect to this different subdomain it "hangs" while staying at mydomain.io/whatever works
[21:55:19] <TimLoal> how are you redirecting?
[22:29:02] <WhirledPress> TimLoal, where do you initiate your widget with an element?
[22:38:11] <z1haze> anyone familiar with requirejs who doesnt mind helping me out? i am getting an error type error: myModel is not a constructor
[22:38:19] <TimLoal> net kicked out
[22:38:24] <z1haze> basic code example here: http://dpaste.com/0ZAPJQ8
[22:41:01] <TimLoal> WhirledPress: this.element = this; seems wrong ?
[22:43:35] <TimLoal> i get the impression from examples that .elements is set by the widget function, when the constructor is fired
[22:45:02] <WhirledPress> this.elements=this doesn't sound right to me.
[22:45:12] <TimLoal> i've hacked it by adding buildItems to $.fn
[22:45:38] <WhirledPress> uggly. People in here on a regular night would scream murder.
[22:45:50] <TimLoal> i've got quite far under my own steam
[22:46:14] <TimLoal> they forget they didn't know once
[22:46:40] <WhirledPress> I would think that you would have an initialization command like $(".selector").mywidgetmethod(somevars);
[22:46:41] <TimLoal> did they just get it uploaded one night matrix style?
[22:47:24] <WhirledPress> TimLoal, come on. It's good that you are learning. but it is also good that people are keeping the code clean.
[22:49:02] <WhirledPress> I could be wrong, but I think your line that says $("#ul"+.....    is a problem on a number of fronts. Fist off, you shouldn't have an element with id='ul'
[22:50:58] <WhirledPress> unless you are naming your elements ULsomething...which would kinda work...i guess... but then after your selector, you have .innerHTML=    but $(ssomething).innerHTML=   should be a problem
[22:51:46] <WhirledPress> if you want to assign the innerHTML property of the element you selected, use $(selector)[0].innerHTML=
[22:52:08] <WhirledPress> the [0] returns the html element rather thant the jquery object
[22:53:08] <WhirledPress> in jquery, $("selector").html(content) is mostly like select.innerHTML=content
[22:54:06] <TimLoal> ok.  this is oldish code i'm porting to jQuery
[22:56:19] <WhirledPress> it looks like the .wigetize() method of jquery creates an object class that has a property called element. this= the widget, not the widgets element property.
[22:57:17] <WhirledPress> and even then, I think it may have been a poor decision to use the word "element" because it appears that it is not the html entity, but rather a jquery-wrapped element making it confusing.
[22:57:58] <TimLoal> yes a little
[22:58:30] <TimLoal> have you found this through hacking or read about it?
[22:59:05] <WhirledPress> both
[22:59:13] <WhirledPress> And listening in here as often as I am able.
[22:59:30] <TimLoal> i'm just thinking its worth me reading it too
[22:59:45] <WhirledPress> There are some really generous and brilliant folks here with a lot of patience. I swear, I would go crazy if I was supporting someone as block headed as I am.
[23:00:04] <WhirledPress> Definitely. The API is online and it's a quick read for most methods.
[23:01:01] <WhirledPress> and honestly, often the thing you are trying to do has been done before. Grab someone else's code and look through it. People are really generous with their code here.
[23:01:02] <TimLoal> i don't find the documentation too great
[23:01:38] <TimLoal> like for instance which is the counterpart of element in reverse
[23:01:48] <WhirledPress> Hmmm, not sure why. If there's something you don't understand in the documentation, ask here and people will change it.
[23:01:54] <WhirledPress> counterpart of element in reverse?
[23:02:05] <TimLoal> sorry yea
[23:02:20] <WhirledPress> let me ask you this: do you understand what $(selector) does..it took me a while before I got it.
[23:03:20] <TimLoal> instance should point to the object instance
[23:03:30] <TimLoal> but i'm still confused on that
[23:03:53] <WhirledPress> Where are you reading that?
[23:04:16] <TimLoal> making the object statesfull is the next mission
[23:04:35] <WhirledPress> which object?
[23:10:24] <TimLoal> *widget
[23:10:51] <TimLoal> i'm thinking OO
[23:11:20] <TimLoal> I wish someone would just draw a picture
[23:13:56] <WhirledPress> The funny thing is that Jquery UI and the widget factory is a lot like the factory model where it generates a jquery object and extends it with custom methods you define
[23:21:03] <TimLoal> do you think its worth it over a standard plugin?
