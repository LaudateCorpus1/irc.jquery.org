[00:34:24] <Guest55743> Hi Team, Good Morning..We are using Struts JQuery Tags to render UI. As part of that we are using DatePicker. So, Date picker is opening in a tab for the first time. When i came back from another tab its not opening.
[00:34:34] <Guest55743> Could please somebody help me out
[00:36:57] <Guest55743> anybody please help me out
[01:17:24] <Cork> guest69[m]: you would have to provide the code, from your information noone can help
[01:17:35] <Cork> ah, he left
[02:07:42] <Guest27711> Hi, We are migrating struts frame work version from 2.3 to 2.5. As part of that we need to upgrate Struts JQuery library also. We have done that. But we are facing with DatePicker. It is opening for the first time in one of the tab. But after i came back from another tab its not opening.  Could anybody please help me out
[02:09:11] <Guest27711> We are using Struts JQuery Plugin version 4.0.3 which uses Core JQuery 2.x
[02:09:28] <Guest27711> May i know what is the issue ?
[02:10:03] <Cork> Guest27711: you need to provide an example of the problem
[02:10:24] <Cork> try reproducing the problem in a jsfiddle.net if possible
[02:10:36] <Cork> a link to the page if you fail at reproducting it
[02:12:36] <Guest27711> 1. We have two tabs in Struts application which will have 2 tabs. 2. First tab contains a DatePicker and after loading the web page when i click on datepicker it is opening and working as expected.  3. After that I went to second tab and came back to first tab again. 4. if i click on datepicker now it is not opening.
[02:13:27] <Woet> Guest27711: you need to provide an example of the problem
[02:13:29] <Woet> try reproducing the problem in a jsfiddle.net if possible
[02:13:31] <Woet> a link to the page if you fail at reproducting it
[02:14:33] <Guest27711> Cork and Woet, I can't reproduce as it has lot of dependencies.
[02:14:48] <Woet> then how are we supposed to help?
[02:14:49] <Guest27711> I explained the procedure above where i am facing issue
[02:14:53] <Cork> can't or can't bother?
[02:14:58] <Cork> meaning have you tried?
[02:15:03] <Woet> the latter, obviously
[02:15:50] <Guest27711> As it is struts application, we have dynamic service calls to fetch data from some other sources
[02:16:17] <Guest27711> That's why i am saying that its not possible to re-produce in jsFiddle
[02:16:29] <Cork> Guest27711: so emulate them with a setTimeout or the jsfiddle echo service
[02:16:44] <Cork> i'm not asking you to reproduce the entire webpage
[02:16:48] <Woet> Guest27711: or hardcode the data since it's unrelated to the issue
[02:16:57] <Woet> Guest27711: thats the entire point of a test case - the minimal amount of code to demonstrate your issue
[02:16:59] <Cork> but try to create a minimal reproduction of the problem; aka try to understand it
[02:17:36] <Guest27711> Can i provide Team viewer access Cork or Woet?
[02:17:43] <Cork> ... no
[02:17:44] <Woet> only if you pay my hourly rate
[02:18:18] <Guest27711> Okay Thanks
[02:18:31] <Cork> Guest27711: trying to reproduce a problem is very often a sure way to make you think about the problem the correct way; and often mean YOU FIND THE PROBLEM YOU'RE SELF
[02:19:01] <Woet> you're self
[02:19:04] <Cork> it is a good first step before asking for help, cause it means you are sure you have understood it
[02:19:55] <Guest27711> Okay
[02:20:35] <Cork> so it is not in order to be pesty, but to teach you to figure out the problem you're self
[02:20:59] <Guest27711> Understood.
[02:21:50] <Cork> (and this is what we would have to do if you got access to the page anyway, cause this is how you debug large pease of code that behaves weirdly)
[02:26:57] <undefined_bob> good morning
[02:30:07] <adnn> I have a DOM element with two "mouseover" events. I want to remove one of those two events. Is there a way I can give IDs to each event so I can distinguish them ?
[02:30:35] <Cork> adnn: namespace the events
[02:30:51] <Cork> 'mouseout.my-removable-event'
[02:31:01] <Woet> Cork: you keep saying you're self
[02:31:04] <Cork> .off('.my-removable-event') or .off('mouseout.my-removable-event')
[02:31:06] <Woet> thats not how English works
[02:43:58] <adnn> Cork: apparently the namespace will only work if I manually trigger the event?
[02:44:10] <Cork> no
[02:45:22] <Cork> adnn: https://jsfiddle.net/szaznw5s/
[02:46:24] <adnn> https://jsfiddle.net/szaznw5s/1/
[02:46:32] <adnn> wait wait, nothing
[02:46:38] <adnn> that's logical actually
[02:46:57] <Cork> :)
[02:47:29] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/szaznw5s/2/
[02:52:43] <adnn> thank you
[04:08:32] <Duikb00t> hi
[04:09:03] <Duikb00t>  Question, how can I easily on input of a textfield ( keydown) enter a value in a checkbox? ( live )
[04:09:28] <Cork> Duikb00t: you want to catch input, not keydown
[04:09:52] <Cork> and just set the val() on the checkbox
[04:10:54] <Duikb00t> Mini example: https://kopy.io/vfvqy
[04:10:59] <Duikb00t> Can I just do that?
[04:11:21] <Duikb00t> e.target.value = the checkbox value and that one should become $(this).val()
[04:12:04] <Cork> Duikb00t: e.target.value would be the same thing as $(this).val() on a textfield
[04:13:27] <Duikb00t> Hmz
[04:14:13] <Cork> but anyway, like i said you want to bind the input event not the keydown event
[04:14:28] <Cork> *keyup
[04:14:56] <Cork> (and keydown even less then keyup)
[04:15:13] <Duikb00t> ok
[04:15:27] <Duikb00t> thanks!
[04:46:17] <devi8> how do I check if an element or jquery object is passed to a function? I can do item.is($) to detect jquery? maybe there's a better way...but an element, I don't know how to check
[04:59:14] <AdamPDotty> first idea would be to check for a specific attribute. Jquery has .length, an element nodeType
[05:00:56] <devi8> thanks. I was hoping that elem instanceOf jQuery and elem=document.documentElement would work...
[05:38:31] <Cork> devi8: i would go with a.constructor.name == 'jQuery'
[05:38:45] <Cork> where a is the instance variable
[05:40:21] <devi8> cool. changed it. thanks.
[05:41:01] <Cork> alternatively you can do: a instanceof $.fn.init
[05:49:34] <devi8> Can I do something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/wc0Ln0bo/2/ or is this really bad?
[06:12:05] <Jiddx> How do I find out which version of jquery UI have added `handle` option for sortable plugin?
[06:14:04] <lessless_> how to find the only the first child that corresponds to the given selector?
[06:16:41] <adnn> https://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/
[06:35:58] <devi8> yeah. val.constructor.name doesn't work if val is undefined.
[06:37:14] <devi8> or I could have a typo. lol one second
[06:40:56] <lessless_> got it, thanks! Another one how to find a checked inputs in the set of of the jquery objects? some_function().find(':checked') doesn't work
[06:42:03] <lessless_> var some function_function = function () { return $('#main').find('input') };
[06:45:48] <devi8> var checkedinput=$("#main input:checked");
[06:46:20] <devi8> will give you all checked inputs in #main
[06:46:40] <lessless_> I need to work on the set returned by the `some_function`
[06:47:16] <devi8> var list=some_function(); return list.filter(":checked");
[06:50:34] <lessless_> thanks!
[08:54:34] <anki> I am using datatable with individual search.For individual column search i have created one more thead.Now on click i would like to hide that thead th
[08:55:15] <tilerendering> anybody in here having used i18next in projects?
[09:03:33] <SlimPrimm> Hey guys
[09:03:48] <SlimPrimm> I have this strip of code where on a click, a video SRC is changed with whatever is in the clicked element
[09:04:07] <SlimPrimm> https://thepasteb.in/p/nZhlLm6AQzPfY
[09:04:18] <SlimPrimm> Now it's working fine but
[09:04:22] <SlimPrimm> I can't make it animate
[09:04:32] <SlimPrimm> Is there a way to do this with a slight fade?
[09:12:51] <thykka> SlimPrimm, no, you'll need at least two separate video elements for that
[09:13:11] <SlimPrimm> Hm
[09:13:19] <SlimPrimm> That'd slow the site down I'm guessing
[09:14:04] <thykka> well, it could increase load time if the second video starts loading with the page, but that would happen in the background
[09:14:53] <thykka> and it can increase the memory requirements of the page, but that only becomes a problem with a *lot* of large videos
[09:15:04] <SlimPrimm> There are a lot
[09:15:10] <SlimPrimm> Which is why I'm using this
[09:15:22] <SlimPrimm> Rather than preload 900 videos
[09:15:36] <SlimPrimm> They all need to load up instantly
[09:15:49] <SlimPrimm> Well, once the user clicks the item and requests the video to be played
[09:16:20] <thykka> yeah, well, you could have 2 video elements where the first is initially visible and the second is initially hidden and without an src... Then once it's time to change the video, you'd set the 2nd video's src, wait for it to have preloaded, then crossfade it on top of the first video. Once the crossfade has finished, you can then re-use the first video element for the 3rd video, etc.
[09:17:11] <thykka> that's functionally close to what you already have, just instead of re-using 1 video element, you'd re-use 2 and alternate between them
[09:17:50] <SlimPrimm> Hm, clever
[09:18:18] <SlimPrimm> Thanks, I'll look into it
[11:09:19] <SlimPrimm> Does anyone else have experience with the utter shitpiece mediaelement.js
[11:09:26] <SlimPrimm> And if so can you please help me out here
[11:10:16] <Woet> why don't you use something else if you're so upset?
[11:10:28] <SlimPrimm> I'm too deep in
[11:10:35] <SlimPrimm> 170 hours deep
[11:10:52] <SlimPrimm> I'd just draw what I need and glue it to my screen at this point
[11:16:51] <Cork> SlimPrimm: if you are just 170h in i would say it is high time to think about if the project should pick something else to base it on
[11:17:11] <Cork> cause that sounds like it is in the early development stage (or a very small project)
[11:17:24] <SlimPrimm> Very small project
[11:17:29] <SlimPrimm> Yeah
[11:19:02] <SlimPrimm> It's near-complete too
[11:19:30] <SlimPrimm> So I can either burn 170h and re-do the entire thing - not even counting for the time necessary to find a system that would work with all the requested featured
[11:19:57] <SlimPrimm> Or find some help regarding this particular plugin
[11:20:10] <Woet> so far you've spent 10 minutes here without asking a question
[11:20:14] <Woet> so it cant be that important
[11:20:20] <SlimPrimm> Fair point
[11:20:23] <SlimPrimm> Okay
[11:20:30] <Woet> let's just hope its related to jQuery
[11:20:48] <SlimPrimm> I basically need to change the bg of a div to red but I don't know the hex code for red
[11:21:01] <SlimPrimm> Sorry
[11:21:05] <Woet> #FF0000
[11:21:06] <SlimPrimm> Bad joke
[11:21:12] <Woet> its rgb after all
[11:21:47] <SlimPrimm> The mediaelement.js player, by default, forces the control menu to disappear when the mouse isn't hovering over it
[11:22:49] <SlimPrimm> Nothing I do in CSS helps and I can't even find my way around the 999999 classes that are changing properties
[11:23:09] <SlimPrimm> I'm basically just trying to force the control (ie play, pause, timeskip) menu to always show
[11:23:35] <SlimPrimm> For such a well developed plugin their documentation is utter shit and googling this brings up a total of 4 results
[11:23:50] <SlimPrimm> Which all lead to spam comments on random blogposts
[11:23:54] <SlimPrimm> So if someone has done thsi
[11:23:56] <SlimPrimm> Please help
[11:36:07] <SlimPrimm> Please brehs
[11:36:36] <Woet> SlimPrimm: I'm just waiting for the jQuery question
[11:37:26] <SlimPrimm> It's a jQuery plugin
[11:37:47] <Woet> yea, it also runs in Google Chrome, doesn't mean you should go ask them
[11:38:09] <SlimPrimm> How do those two even relate
[11:38:20] <SlimPrimm> It's a jQuery IRC
[11:39:49] <SlimPrimm> Either way I catch your point
[11:40:02] <SlimPrimm> Just it's a fairly common plugin so someone could've come across it
[11:40:12] <Woet> well, it would help if you would create a jsfiddle of your testcase
[11:40:29] <Woet> theres not much to actually help you with
[11:42:18] <SlimPrimm> Unfortunately I can't fiddle it simply because whatever hides the menu is deeply embedded into the plugin itself
[11:42:20] <grapheti> SlimPrimm: is this in wordpress?
[11:42:26] <SlimPrimm> Yeah grapheti
[11:42:34] <grapheti> Yeah, they made a change
[11:42:52] <SlimPrimm> It comes pre-packed with WP core I think, so I can't even edit it very easily
[11:42:52] <grapheti> You no longer have to reference mediaelements.
[11:42:55] <SlimPrimm> Oh
[11:42:58] <grapheti> So you can remove that code.
[11:43:22] <grapheti> $('video, audio').mediaelementplayer({
[11:43:24] <grapheti> that code
[11:43:50] <grapheti> I had fun figuring that out too.
[11:43:52] <grapheti> :D
[11:43:54] <SlimPrimm> How did you know
[11:44:00] <grapheti> Accident
[11:44:07] <SlimPrimm> I found a solution 10 minutes ago with just that strip you showed me
[11:44:11] <SlimPrimm> But it didn't work
[11:44:19] <grapheti> Hrm.
[11:44:25] <grapheti> Does it give you any errors?
[11:44:52] <SlimPrimm> Nope. Not any issue I encountered didn't return much
[11:44:57] <SlimPrimm> I'll look for it again
[11:45:05] <grapheti> So you removed the $('video, audio').mediaelementplayer({ code?
[11:45:31] <SlimPrimm> Not quite - I don't even know where to look :/
[11:45:41] <SlimPrimm> This
[11:45:47] <SlimPrimm> https://thepasteb.in/p/Y6hkZANjp4oI7
[11:45:50] <grapheti> Do a Ctrl+F in your text editor
[11:46:00] <SlimPrimm> I did not implement that, though
[11:46:01] <grapheti> look in all the files for .mediaelementplayer
[11:46:05] <SlimPrimm> Ah
[11:46:09] <SlimPrimm> Won't a core update
[11:46:14] <SlimPrimm> Just obliterate my changes?
[11:46:19] <grapheti> yeah, that's the code. Just remove the whole thing.
[11:46:32] <grapheti> Are you testing it locally?
[11:46:40] <grapheti> It doesn't matter in this case.
[11:46:47] <SlimPrimm> Well I mean, it's live right now
[11:46:52] <SlimPrimm> The sitee
[11:46:53] <SlimPrimm> site*
[11:46:55] <grapheti> Do you have a local copy of it?
[11:47:02] <SlimPrimm> No, but I can get it
[11:47:05] <grapheti> If not, you should.
[11:47:08] <grapheti> :P
[11:47:20] <SlimPrimm> I'm just the temp guy
[11:47:24] <grapheti> then run it on a server like wamp
[11:47:29] <grapheti> or w/e you use
[11:47:32] <grapheti> mac/pc
[11:47:43] <grapheti> Make sure it works, then publish
[11:49:20] <SlimPrimm> What happens if WP updates it's core though?
[11:49:28] <SlimPrimm> Won't my core changes be removed?
[11:49:35] <SlimPrimm> I mean, I can local test before, yeah
[11:49:41] <SlimPrimm> But I won't be doing the maintenance here
[11:49:45] <SlimPrimm> If someone overwrites it
[11:52:38] <SlimPrimm> I was kinda hoping there's a way to do this without changing the actual plugin files
[11:52:44] <SlimPrimm> Just overwriting them
[13:15:03] <RabSimpson> Hi folks, I'm looping through some elements with jQuery().each() and trying to add a delay to each iteration but the timeout isn't coming into effect and everything is happening at once. Here's my url: https://hillhay.darwincm.net/?bypass_=1 (js is in home.js) Any ideas?
[13:15:38] <RabSimpson> The specific function is homeTriggerAnimations()
[13:16:47] <guideX> when I try to read the height of a div, I get 357 but the actual size is 431
[13:16:56] <guideX> I am using $(this).outerHeight(true);
[13:17:45] <guideX> https://pastebin.com/raw/TYviFnbh
[13:19:19] <guideX> oh wait, nm
[13:22:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:23:01] <SlimPrimm> Hey guys is there a jQuery function
[13:23:07] <SlimPrimm> Which recognizes a swipe left/right
[13:23:25] <SlimPrimm> Basically hide div 1 on swipe left, show div 2
[13:23:33] <SlimPrimm> Then hide div 2
[13:24:11] <robertmaxrees> you want a touch enabled carousel.
[13:25:03] <SlimPrimm> Can I do that myself?
[13:25:07] <SlimPrimm> In relatively little time?
[13:25:21] <SlimPrimm> Or do I have to write 4000 lines of jQuery to make it work
[13:25:25] <robertmaxrees> *javascript
[13:25:31] <SlimPrimm> *javascript :)
[13:25:40] <robertmaxrees> and you could try.
[13:25:50] <robertmaxrees> though honestly, why solve a problem somebody else has solved for you?
[13:26:10] <SlimPrimm> TBH I was looking for solutions but
[13:26:15] <SlimPrimm> Couldn't find much
[13:26:52] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=touch+enabled+carousel
[13:26:59] <robertmaxrees> first result on this page seems to be what you want.
[13:27:02] <robertmaxrees> http://idangero.us/swiper/
[13:27:19] <SlimPrimm> I don't want to use plugins though
[13:27:25] <SlimPrimm> Nor do I know how to
[13:27:30] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:27:32] <SlimPrimm> Set up a jquery plugin to wordpress
[13:27:52] <robertmaxrees> so you wanted to find a solution that you had to write yourself?
[13:28:10] <SlimPrimm> Just wondering if it's possible
[13:28:20] <robertmaxrees> It obviously is if somebody else has done it :)
[13:28:28] <SlimPrimm> Simply onDrag Div.addClass(-200px) or something
[13:28:36] <robertmaxrees> not that simple.
[13:28:39] <SlimPrimm> I know this is the worst banana attempt
[13:28:41] <SlimPrimm> Yeah
[13:28:51] <SlimPrimm> :/
[13:29:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:29:13] <robertmaxrees> this is why plugins and libraries exist :D
[13:30:50] <SlimPrimm> robert all these carousels though
[13:30:56] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:30:57] <SlimPrimm> There's just one 100% wide div
[13:31:02] <SlimPrimm> I need 4 25% wide divs
[13:31:13] <SlimPrimm> But when you swipe, it moves them one by one
[13:31:14] <robertmaxrees> then find one that does what you want.
[13:31:25] <SlimPrimm> From your experience
[13:31:28] <SlimPrimm> This can be done?
[13:31:36] <robertmaxrees> it HAS been done.
[13:31:36] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:31:43] <robertmaxrees> what are yopu actually building?
[13:31:46] <robertmaxrees> *you
[13:32:48] <SlimPrimm> Just hearing out crazy client requests
[13:32:59] <robertmaxrees> right, so what are they asking for?
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> image gallery?
[13:33:02] <SlimPrimm> I've never tried it but I'd try
[13:33:05] <SlimPrimm> Basically
[13:33:05] <SlimPrimm> No
[13:34:15] <SlimPrimm> 20 swiping items
[13:34:23] <robertmaxrees> for...?
[13:34:23] <SlimPrimm> 19 are with an opacity of 0.1
[13:34:31] <SlimPrimm> The one in focus is opacity 1
[13:34:43] <SlimPrimm> When you swipe left, a new one comes in focus, one per swipe
[13:34:49] <SlimPrimm> I dunno, posts I think
[13:34:52] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:34:53] <SlimPrimm> Regular post types will open
[13:35:28] <robertmaxrees> i mean, yeah, you could build out something like that.
[13:35:39] <robertmaxrees> the touch interaction will be funky but it's certainly doable.
[13:36:05] <SlimPrimm> Hm
[13:38:48] <Treaktor> Hi, can someone verify my syntax. I'm trying to bind a couple of function handlers into one click event and not sure if seperating the handlers with a comma is correct or if I'm missing something: $('.steps li').on('click', setCurrentModule, setCurrentSubModule);
[13:39:20] <robertmaxrees> Treaktor you can't add multiple handlers like that.
[13:39:36] <Treaktor> That explains a lot
[13:39:43] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/ :)
[13:40:00] <robertmaxrees> none of the signatures accept more than one handler.
[13:41:05] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/d2d49b20167f
[13:41:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd do something like this.
[13:43:17] <Treaktor> Yeah, I have something similar where I'm declaring the pure functions, then putting the actual events where they're called in another func called bindFunctions, which eventually ends up in a final init function
[13:43:46] <robertmaxrees> bit cleaner to handle it that way imo.
[13:44:07] <Treaktor> Yeah, revealing module pattern is sort of my go to
[13:50:23] <sadtaco> Does anyone know of a native scrollbar div plugin that actually works?  I have elements with scrollbars that get resized, shown and hidden. For nanoscroller, it requires recalculating the scrollbar with a manual call incredibly often.
[13:51:39] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco why not just use overflow: scroll; ?
[13:53:37] <sadtaco> why doesn't twitch, discord, youtube, and every other webapp just use overflow:scroll;?
[13:53:54] <robertmaxrees> just a simple question duder.
[13:53:55] <robertmaxrees> rikes.
[13:53:58] <robertmaxrees> *yikes
[13:54:04] <sadtaco> I answered it
[13:54:11] <robertmaxrees> you tell me.
[13:54:14] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:55:04] <sadtaco> because it's uses up a lot of space in a web app that is useless and the scroll bar is rarely used on them.
[13:56:19] <sadtaco> twitch uses simplebar but I had trouble getting that working. hm
[13:56:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:58:33] <Treaktor> robertmaxrees if I have the two separate click events in a function, do they fire at the same time? I'm finding things working in codepen but in my local build, I'm having to click twice
[13:58:45] <Treaktor> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zRvJxg
[13:58:54] <rhizome> scrollbars are hard
[13:59:19] <robertmaxrees> traptrip one first and then the other.
[13:59:29] <robertmaxrees> err, Treaktor
[13:59:42] <Treaktor> ah, well that blows.
[14:00:18] <Guest81810> hi im here for robertmaxrees
[14:00:26] <Treaktor> haha
[14:00:30] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:00:45] <Guest81810> please step into the limo sir
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> irssi you're a weird due
[14:02:15] <robertmaxrees> *dude
[14:05:10] <Guest81810> were taking u downtown
[14:05:17] <Guest81810> trumps orders
[14:05:45] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[14:05:56] <robertmaxrees> Treaktor why does the order of the handlers matter?
[14:06:30] <Treaktor> Nm, it was a stupid mistake on my part in one of the functions—I had the click even in it rather than just the pure bits...ewps
[14:06:40] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:18:58] <Treaktor> robertmaxrees Any idea how I can prevent the submodules (from showing up when clicking the disabled items and keep the 'current' class from turning off when I select a disabled item)?
[14:18:59] <Treaktor> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zRvJxg
[14:21:36] <robertmaxrees> so basically, ignore clicks on disabled items?
[14:21:44] <Treaktor> yeah
[14:23:24] <robertmaxrees> check if the element hasClass('disabled'); and don't do anything if it does.
[14:25:09] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mXVpLB would take some minor refactoring to get the other functions to work.
[14:25:28] <robertmaxrees> but you get the idea.
[14:31:34] <Treaktor> It's like thinking in reverse
[14:31:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:31:43] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[14:34:39] <Treaktor> I had been messing with ! and .not() trying to do a conditional
[14:37:22] <Treaktor> Why does that break the two functions?
[14:37:36] <robertmaxrees> because $(this) is no longer the element.
[14:39:49] <Treaktor> I thought they were contained to their scope in each function
[14:41:09] <robertmaxrees> 'this' in JS is a funny thing.
[14:41:21] <Treaktor> yeah it is
[14:41:33] <Treaktor> I thought I more or less understood it but this is throwing me off
[14:41:36] <robertmaxrees> http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/
[14:41:40] <sadtaco> https://github.com/albertogasparin/Optiscroll uses timers to check for overflow changes. Oof
[14:41:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd swap to rely on the event object Treaktor
[14:43:11] <robertmaxrees> http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/ Treaktor for some more info on 'this'
[14:43:49] <Treaktor> in your pen, can you show me a quick example of how I can do that...if I can see the pattern, I may be able to follow a bit more
[14:44:11] <robertmaxrees> i showed you in that new function I created./
[14:51:07] <Treaktor> I just wasn't following how it ties into the original functions...if I'm supposed to give them an event arguement and use the same currentTarget...
[14:52:57] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, The dropdown tabular links resulted in exactly 1/3 the lines of code, but it is much lighter than dynamically generating the tabs with jQuery. Thank you for your help in getting the original working. :)
[15:36:57] <JacquesLacan> Anyone experienced with jQuery UI?
[15:37:22] <JacquesLacan> I'm trying to fire up an event whenever a select menu LOSES focus... nothing seems to work, tried blur and focusout
[15:50:05] <tsukasadt> JacquesLacan, can you provide the code that's having the problem?
[17:04:57] <AliG1000> I want to record and store the number of times a link is clicked across the site. What is the best way to do this?
[17:08:57] <AliG1000> FileReader only reads a file, but how can I write?
[17:13:13] <AliG1000> Or can I just do this via ajax?
[17:18:20] <rhizome> why would you write to a file for that?
[17:19:15] <AliG1000> What is the best way to do this?
[17:19:20] <AliG1000> What is the best way to do this?
[17:19:34] <AliG1000> oops, sorry for pasting twice
[17:19:52] <AliG1000> I assume I have to store this data somewhere
[17:21:05] <rhizome> that somewhere depends on how you want to use it
[17:22:14] <AliG1000> I want to see how users are interacting with the page, and to know when a link has been clicked. A simple count would be OK
[17:29:40] <rhizome> use a web log analyzer
[17:38:21] <AliG1000> or Google analytics?
[17:42:48] <Treaktor> Anyone around that can help me sort through a bit of a complicated hover issue?
[17:43:01] <rhizome> AliG1000: sure
[17:43:22] <Treaktor> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zRvJxg
[17:44:13] <Treaktor> trying to sort why the hover isn't working. using the same base logic as the function called in my click ahndler
[17:46:00] <rhizome> what does "isn't working" mean?
[17:47:23] <AliG1000> rhizome: thank you
[17:47:55] <rhizome> you're welcome
[17:52:09] <Treaktor> "isn't working' means the hover isn't showing the hidden content when I mouse over each of the steps in the menu
[17:53:17] <Treaktor> Hey, Robert, welcome back. I've mostly got that progresstracker working after refactoring
[17:55:23] <Treaktor> rhizome essentially when you click either of the three buttons (the last two are disabled), it shows submodule content. I need to keep the current one up but when I hover over the other ones, their respective submodules show up; when I hover out, the currently selected one is still there
[17:57:34] <rhizome> i'm a little unclear on the order of the clicking vs. hovering operations
[17:57:53] <rhizome> clicking seems to work? if so, maybe forget about that for now.
[17:59:48] <Treaktor> the clicking part is correct. Like I said, just trying to sort why the hover isn't working.
[18:00:30] <rhizome> right, but after clicking submod 3, hovering out will display active submod? should active submod be displayed by default, i.e. on page load?
[18:04:19] <Treaktor> No, it's not that difficult. Default doesn't matter here. Essentially a user will click on a module and the associated submodules will show up.  The hover just allows the user to rollover to see the contents of other submodules. The current one (the one that was actually clicked stays up
[18:04:43] <Treaktor> So the hover would be something like this: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PQZQMY
[18:04:57] <Treaktor> that's an earlier version before I had click working
[18:05:37] <Treaktor> and before I had other issues ironed out
[18:06:56] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue right now?
[18:07:02] <robertmaxrees> sorry, been in and out.
[18:07:51] <Treaktor> Just trying to sort the hover I'm trying to implement. It basically has to hover over the the modules and show the submodules
[18:08:06] <Treaktor> and hide them on mouseleave.
[18:08:19] <Treaktor> while the original clicked one still stays up
[18:08:24] <robertmaxrees> so wha3t's the current issue?
[18:08:33] <Treaktor> hover's not working
[18:08:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:08:44] <robertmaxrees> it's unemployed
[18:08:44] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:08:58] <Treaktor> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zRvJxg
[18:08:58] <robertmaxrees> you mean it's hiding the subs when you leave an item?
[18:09:24] <robertmaxrees> Treaktor https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PQZQMY this seems pretty close.
[18:09:52] <rhizome> Treaktor: ah, so "show on hover; sticky on click?"
[18:09:59] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:10:10] <robertmaxrees> you need a way to manage state for which is the current "Acive" vs "Hover"
[18:10:30] <robertmaxrees> brb
[18:10:30] <Treaktor> rhizome yes
[18:15:41] <robertmaxrees> back
[18:17:54] <Treaktor> So how would I incorporate something like that?
[18:18:12] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways
[18:18:27] <Treaktor> I've done flag stuff once or twice var isClicked = true;
[18:18:32] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[18:18:38] <Treaktor> egg-zactly
[18:18:50] <robertmaxrees> one could be to use CSS - have a separate class for hover and let that have a higher z-index.
[18:19:18] <robertmaxrees> alternatively use an object to track states of what's active and fall back to that.  nothing too wrong with doing that.
[18:19:40] <Treaktor> >_<
[18:19:47] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:20:57] <Treaktor> I think the first way was more what I was aiming at. I just wanted to get something showing up at this point. The code I used was based on the pen you pointed out
[18:21:13] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what's holding you back from doing that?
[18:22:33] <Treaktor> Actually if I use that code outside of my module, the hover works (breaks the click but the hover works).
[18:22:44] <robertmaxrees> "breaks the click"?
[18:22:54] <robertmaxrees> heh, gotta be more specific homeslice.
[18:23:12] <Treaktor> the clicked item doesn't persist
[18:23:31] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:24:03] <robertmaxrees> you gotta decouple item display between the two actions.
[18:25:07] <Treaktor> I don't even know where to begin....
[18:25:42] <robertmaxrees> you'd use two separate classes.
[18:25:47] <robertmaxrees> one for click, one for hover.
[18:29:55] <robertmaxrees> *css classes, bntw.
[18:29:56] <robertmaxrees> *btw
[18:35:34] <Treaktor> man, I just can't grok this. I'll sit down with my coworker Monday and focus on styling the submodules.
[18:35:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:35:43] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[18:35:54] <robertmaxrees> probnably a good idea to step back for a fdew.
[18:35:55] <robertmaxrees> *few
[18:36:04] <Treaktor> Thanks for the help, it got me most of the way there
[18:36:39] <Treaktor> just amazing how the most simple of UI things can get convoluted
[18:38:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:45:37] <SideFX> Is anyone familiar with modernizer?
[18:47:26] <robertmaxrees> SideFX plenty of people are.
[18:48:53] <SideFX> I'm trying to modify a <select> list with jquery, but modernizer seems to write the object as something else so I can't interract with the <select>  Is there any way to deal with this?
[18:49:15] <robertmaxrees> what version od modernizr are you using?
[18:49:39] <SideFX> 2.6.1
[18:49:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah okay
[18:50:21] <robertmaxrees> so first off - are you using any weird polifills?  the current version doesn't do any of that iirc.
[18:50:28] <robertmaxrees> it's just a feature detection lib these days.,
[18:51:24] <SideFX> I would like to rip it out but it's so integrated with anything it would be like a whole re-write of the site
[18:51:46] <SideFX> (I'm taking on a project that was started by someone who got fired cause they were terrible)
[18:51:55] <robertmaxrees> also: why do you think modernizr is replacing the select?
[18:53:07] <SideFX> When I inspect element the <select> in the actual code is gone, and replaced with a bunch of divs and spans and <a>'s
[18:53:24] <SideFX> You can also see it do the re-write right after the page loads
[18:53:28] <robertmaxrees> are you using bootstrap or any other libs?
[18:53:39] <robertmaxrees> because last i checked modernizr doesn't do stuff like that at all.
[18:53:59] <SideFX> There is some bootstrap but bootstrap doesn't replace <select>'s like that to my knowledge
[18:54:11] <robertmaxrees> it can :)
[18:54:16] <robertmaxrees> for their custom ones.
[18:54:37] <SideFX> Let me comment bootstrap out from loading and see how it looks
[19:11:41] <SideFX> It's not bootstrap
[19:13:51] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/czdyh8w0/
[19:13:52] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[19:13:58] <robertmaxrees> doesn'
[19:14:07] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't seem to be modernizr, either.
[19:19:51] <SideFX> It must be something modernizer is loading.  If I remove the modernizer line, it works like normal html.
[19:19:57] <SideFX> I wonder if I can find a loader
[19:21:28] <robertmaxrees> are you getting any console errors when you remove modernizr?
[19:24:39] <SideFX> Yeah, something called script.js
[19:24:42] <SideFX> Let me look at that
