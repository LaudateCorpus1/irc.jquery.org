[01:41:57] <wfq> hi guys
[01:42:28] <wfq> can I fade away div's background images?
[02:08:01] <Kartagis> doug64k: ping
[02:09:17] <doug64k> Kartagis: hi
[02:09:53] <Kartagis> doug64k: thanks for the correction to my fiddle yesterday
[02:10:02] <doug64k> np
[02:10:18] <Kartagis> what did you mean by unnecessary event handlers?
[02:10:35] <doug64k> your code set a bunch of separate event handlers on each thing
[02:10:48] <Kartagis> two fields were textfields and one was a select
[02:10:56] <doug64k> you only needed one event handler to do it all
[02:11:16] <Kartagis> can I use input on select?
[02:11:25] <doug64k> change
[02:11:30] <Kartagis> I though select took only change
[02:11:48] <doug64k> x.on('input change', ...
[02:11:50] <doug64k> handles both
[02:11:59] <Kartagis> hmm
[02:12:23] <Kartagis> can I handle all fields with this then?
[02:12:40] <doug64k> yes, as shown in my fiddle
[02:12:47] <Kartagis> this I have to try
[02:12:55] <Kartagis> let me open it up
[02:17:17] <doug64k> it works because when an event happens, it happens for the element, its parent, and the rest of its ancestors, unless stopped by a call to event.stopPropagation
[02:17:32] <doug64k> all the way up to document
[02:19:13] <doug64k> ideally, you would put the form element selector where I have document
[02:19:26] <doug64k> or just anything that is a parent of all of the inputs
[02:19:34] <doug64k> ancestor I mean
[02:19:47] <doug64k> Kartagis: ^
[02:20:45] <Kartagis> doug64k: your code gives me 67, whereas I want Muzaffer
[02:23:30] <doug64k> can you post the fiddle link
[02:23:36] <doug64k> its past my scrollback
[02:24:16] <doug64k> pretty sure .text() on that element will do it
[02:24:23] <doug64k> instead of .val()
[02:24:44] <doug64k> Kartagis: ^
[02:25:19] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/0hfgbej0/4/
[02:25:38] <Kartagis> .text() gives me all options
[02:27:39] <doug64k> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/0hfgbej0/5/
[02:29:23] <doug64k> that 2nd parameter to $ is the scope, means start searching here
[02:30:01] <Kartagis> doug64k: I don't wanna brag, but my code doesn't put -Select- in vehicle reference as soon as type in the vehicle number :)
[02:30:48] <doug64k> it does if you choose select from the dropdown first
[02:30:59] <doug64k> right?
[02:31:05] <Kartagis> yes
[02:31:13] <doug64k> yours hides the bug :)
[02:31:23] <doug64k> mine reveals it before people do the form backwards and find it
[02:31:25] <Kartagis> so there is a bug
[02:32:30] <doug64k> if you would rather micromanage it, that's fine too
[02:33:10] <doug64k> the corner cases will still be there but harder to find
[02:33:41] <doug64k> it could reject that value, but then the generalization is lost
[02:33:58] <doug64k> ah... here's a quick fix
[02:42:27] <doug64k> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/0hfgbej0/6/
[02:44:02] <doug64k> Kartagis: prevents an option with a blank value from being considered
[02:44:28] <Kartagis> hmm, you added "if the option is not ''"
[02:44:50] <doug64k> almost - if the option's value attribute is not ''
[02:46:55] <doug64k> if --select-- is selected, option[val!=''] is an empty set, then it selects :selected from the empty set and returns empty set, which has '' text
[02:47:37] <doug64k> oops, option[val!=''] is a set of options that arent --select--
[03:03:35] <Kartagis> what can I use .hasClass() on? $(document) ?
[03:12:08] <doug64k> Kartagis: anything
[03:12:50] <Kartagis> can I do something like if $('body').hasClass('page-node-5') { .... } else if $('body').hasClass('page-node-1') { ..... } ?
[03:13:17] <doug64k> yes
[03:13:32] <doug64k> that's a class on the body element?
[03:13:45] <Kartagis> yes
[03:13:56] <Kartagis> one of the classes
[03:13:57] <doug64k> if do you mean "tell me if something somewhere has that class"
[03:14:02] <doug64k> or*
[03:14:15] <Kartagis> latter I guess
[03:14:27] <doug64k> $('.page-node-5').length > 0
[03:14:59] <doug64k> means, "true if something on the page has the class "page-node-5"
[03:15:25] <Kartagis> hrmm
[03:20:09] <Kartagis> doug64k: no if on $('.page-node-5').length > 0 ?
[03:26:49] <doug64k> you mean ignore events based on class?
[03:27:49] <Mark__> hello.
[03:30:47] <doug64k> hi
[03:31:57] <Mark__> anybody here webdeisgner?
[03:33:29] <mooncup> Mark__: quite a few people given that it's a jquey channel I would assume
[03:35:14] <doug64k> Mark__: light travels 3 to 6 inches in the time it takes for a modern cpu to complete one clock cycle
[03:40:40] <Mark__> ㅑ ㄴㄸ.
[03:40:42] <Mark__> i see.
[03:41:08] <Mark__> anyone who has website, please share with us!
[03:42:22] <dw1> thats top secret info
[03:42:43] <dw1> sharing will create more competition :p
[03:42:57] <doug64k> Mark__: jsfiddle.net/r6n99180/
[03:43:19] <doug64k> sorry, I am in a silly mood
[03:43:45] <Mark__> how awesome.
[03:43:57] <Mark__> go watch porn.
[03:48:49] <Kartagis> Mark__: I'm a web developer
[03:48:58] <Mark__> awesome,
[03:49:07] <Mark__> weren’t you in the #web channel as well?
[03:49:17] <Mark__> or not.
[03:49:29] <Kartagis> yea, I was once
[04:17:29] <WeNDoR_> hi
[04:18:31] <WeNDoR_> my does anyone know why by using qunit i get an error like this when testing: /client/tests/tests.js:14: 'null' is not an object (evaluating 'incommingmessage.documentElement.firstChild')
[04:18:32] <WeNDoR_> TypeError: 'null' is not an object (evaluating 'incommingmessage.documentElement.firstChild')
[04:18:57] <WeNDoR_> but when i test the code in a browser it works flawlessly ?
[04:20:50] <WeNDoR_> it looks like i can't use .documentElement.firstChild on a XML Object. but what can i use then ?
[04:23:11] <raphy> hello
[04:24:46] <raphy> I have a problem, my script has no error, but for a while my menu is not fixed and chrome console shows me
[04:25:02] <raphy> Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CACHE_MISS
[04:25:20] <raphy> what is it?
[04:30:18] <Mark__> does anyone know how to apply this js? http://blurjs.com/
[04:30:31] <Mark__> i’ve done everything i was asked to do, but still can’t get it working
[04:46:11] <frank_o> god i love iscroll
[05:20:30] <frank_o> Hi! I'm using deferred objects to know when jQuery Embedly has processed all my YouTubes into clickable thumbnails: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ttLjxxaw/1/
[05:20:33] <frank_o> Right now it 1) lets one know when all items are processed, 2) iterates through all the items. But instead, how to let one know when each item is processed and then iterate through it directly, instead of having to wait for all the other items to finish?
[05:38:07] <shoky> frank_o it doesn't let you know when all items are processed, the way you have it now. a deferred can only be resolved once. so your deferred is resolved as soon as the first done callback is called
[05:39:06] <R13ose> hi
[05:40:34] <frank_o> shoky: Cool, I think I know what you mean, let me ponder this for a sec
[05:41:05] <frank_o> shoky: Trying something like this atm: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ttLjxxaw/2/
[05:41:38] <shoky> frank_o yes that's getting better, though donno what the setTimeout is for
[05:41:57] <R13ose> How come on the desktop version of this code, the width is too much but on the mobile version this is perfect?  The images are also not taking up 100% of the screen either past as a certain point, maybe because the images are too small and not responsive. Code: http://pastebin.com/zYGnRX5s
[05:42:14] <frank_o> just so I can add some delay so I know it's processing them one by one. currently doesnt work though
[05:43:34] <shoky> frank_o because you added the setTimeout function, so "this" has changed
[05:44:11] <shoky> frank_o: i'd use .map like this  http://jsfiddle.net/ttLjxxaw/3/
[05:45:55] <shoky> frank_o: better log now  http://jsfiddle.net/ttLjxxaw/4/
[05:46:25] <frank_o> shoky: I think we can drop the whenDoneArray though
[05:47:08] <shoky> it lets you know when all are done
[05:47:37] <frank_o> yep. ive thought long about it and i dont think i actually need that info. id rather process each item directly after it's done so the user doesnt have to wait too long incase there are too many items
[05:48:04] <shoky> oks. no need for any deferred then
[05:48:14] <frank_o> R13ose: maybe your images should have `max-width: 100%` as in http://css-tricks.com/rundown-of-handling-flexible-media/ ?
[05:49:02] <frank_o> shoky: i need to know when each is done though.. for that, don't I need the `whenDoneItem.resolve();` as in http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ttLjxxaw/2/ ?
[05:49:12] <R13ose> frank_o: looking into that
[05:49:58] <shoky> frank_o: no.. all you need is embedly's "done" callback.. http://jsfiddle.net/ttLjxxaw/5/
[05:50:07] <frank_o> shoky: aaah I see I see
[05:50:34] <frank_o> bloody perfect then :P
[05:50:48] <shoky> yay callbacks ;p
[05:51:10] <frank_o> callbacks 4 life homie
[05:51:28] <R13ose> frank_o: makes no difference.  there is still black there.  The width is: 2486px;  Do you want to see the website?
[05:55:08] <Mark__> does anyone know how to apply this js? http://blurjs.com/
[05:55:08] <Mark__> i’ve done everything i was asked to do, but still can’t get it working
[05:58:56] <pheas> Before i upload this to github, I was wondering if i can get first impressions ? anyone interested?
[06:00:06] <Mark__> guess not
[06:02:04] <pheas> :(
[06:03:35] <_rgn> Mark__: "can't get it working" is a terrible way to describe your issue if you're trying to get help
[06:03:57] <Mark__> welll, i coudln’t find any other way to express my situation lol
[06:04:10] <Mark__> literally, i cannot get it working.
[06:07:06] <R13ose> frank_o: any other thoughts?
[06:10:37] <R13ose> Any thoughts on my question?
[06:14:12] <pheas> Mark__: so u want to have transparent objects right?
[06:14:22] <Mark__> yes
[06:14:31] <Mark__> that js file didn’t work for me.
[06:15:08] <pheas> hmm i looked a round and found something called fadeto
[06:15:22] <pheas> check out this test case http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_eff_fadeto
[06:16:02] <Mark__> dude.
[06:16:13] <Mark__> this is no way near to the result im looking for.
[06:16:31] <Mark__> i want to blur things, not slightly change the opacity
[06:16:53] <Mark__> magneto lol
[06:17:11] <shoky> Mark__ i got it "working" but it seems to do a pretty crappy job.. and if draggable is turned off its even worse.  http://jsfiddle.net/gyL6776e/2/
[06:17:43] <Mag-neto> hey stuck with iframe anyone know ??
[06:18:15] <Mark__> shoky// thanks.
[06:18:27] <Mark__> but yeah, it does look pretty crap to me as well
[06:18:30] <Mark__> lol
[06:18:39] <Mark__> '
[06:20:42] <R13ose> :(
[06:22:25] <Mark__> i tried applying your exact code on my webpage, and it’s still not working, great.
[06:23:46] <shoky> Mark__ the image has to be from the same domain, i think
[06:24:05] <Mark__> it is.
[06:24:19] <shoky> o well
[06:24:29] <Mark__> http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/board_UjVG71
[06:24:43] <Mark__> i must be a really terrible coder.
[06:25:04] <shoky> Mark__ you're getting lots of errors in the console
[06:25:10] <shoky> one of them coming from the .blurjs line
[06:25:15] <Mark__> yeah, i still couldn’t fix it.
[06:25:21] <Mark__> i don’t know how to fix it ;(
[06:26:36] <shoky> Mark__: http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/blur.min.js  is a 404
[06:26:57] <Mark__> i see.
[06:26:58] <pheas> R13ose: i think i have the same problem, well not that of a big deal. one computer the size looks great but a different computer everything looks too big. It was the resolution fault.
[06:26:59] <R13ose> Mark__: there are a lot of errors because you are using old code, try to move the code to newest.
[06:27:15] <Mark__> thx for the tip, i will try.
[06:27:41] <R13ose> pheas: you want to see the site?
[06:28:00] <pheas> ok
[06:29:05] <R13ose> pheas: the portfolio section of http://plushinteractive.ca/ if you don't see the black on the right side, click the right arrow.
[06:29:45] <Mark__> one is from canada, and one is from israel.
[06:31:08] <Zamp1> Hello :)
[06:31:09] <R13ose> Mark__: uh?
[06:31:57] <Mark__> hmmm, weird. i fixed the 404 issue, and im still getting the same result.
[06:32:27] <R13ose> Mark__: did you fix the console errors?
[06:32:37] <Mark__> just one.
[06:32:44] <Mark__> i don’t know how to fix console errors.
[06:33:11] <R13ose> Mark__: did you google search them?  Maybe ask in here afterwards.
[06:33:48] <Zamp1> Anyone fimiliar with changing a video.src via an HTML Attribute? :)
[06:33:55] <Zamp1> If so anyone want to help me out :)
[06:34:23] <frank_o> R13ose, Mark__, did you guys manage to come up with a live testcase of your problems?
[06:34:47] <shoky> Mark__ also your code isn't in a $(document).ready handler
[06:34:53] <frank_o> sorry my connection is real shitty i keep falling in and out
[06:35:10] <frank_o> *of looooove*
[06:35:11] <Mark__> shoky// enlighten me. please tell me how to fix these problems.
[06:35:31] <shoky> Mark__: i just told you
[06:35:45] <R13ose> frank_o: I have one which I did post above.
[06:36:50] <frank_o> R13ose, Mark__: a link to your website is not a live testcase. a live testcase is a sandbox like http://jsfiddle.net, http://jsbin.com or http://codepen.io containing only the bare minimum html, css and JS required to illustrate your problem.
[06:37:18] <Mark__> thanks for the info, frank.
[06:37:24] <Mark__> but im a newbie
[06:37:31] <shoky> Mark__: at least that's the current issue i'm seeing with the blurjs thing. other errors are cause you have too much crap in that page, tons of different jquery versions included in differnt places overwriting eachother, also you have a commented <script> there that is not fully commented so getting a syntax error.... look at the console, read the errors, click their links to see where its coming from, etc....
[06:37:35] <Zamp1> Mark
[06:37:43] <Zamp1> if you zip your files and share a dropbox link
[06:37:49] <Zamp1> ill put it up on codebox or something for them.
[06:37:52] <frank_o> Mark__: i swear to god man that's the best way to get help, especially if you're a newbie
[06:38:18] <Mark__> zamp1 // can you really do that for me?
[06:38:25] <Zamp1> Yep share a dropbox link here
[06:38:31] <Mark__> sec.
[06:38:32] <R13ose> frank_o: I know but I feel doing that way is harder for the person doing that.
[06:38:32] <Zamp1> or e-mail me it Seth@fane.co
[06:38:48] <R13ose> pheas: any further thoughts?
[06:38:54] <Mark__> you guys are awesome people.
[06:39:09] <Zamp1> :-)
[06:39:59] <frank_o_> R13ose: but not doing it is way harder for the people actually trying to help. hence, less chance of getting help =/
[06:39:59] <pheas> R13ose: yeah just using firebug to play around, i think using the 100% on img might be the problem
[06:40:08] <frank_o_> R13ose: also by trying to reproduce your problem inside a testcase you often figure out the solution even before you present it to others
[06:40:37] <Mark__> zamp1: i just sent you the files.
[06:40:42] <pheas> R13ose: i going to continue playing around
[06:40:45] <Zamp1> Sounds good checking mail now :-)
[06:41:28] <frank_o_> ive gotten a LOT of help here and for that im super grateful. but if it wasnt for jsfiddle i'd have gotten little to none.
[06:41:50] <Mark__> what is jsfiddle for?
[06:41:51] <Mark__> code sharing?
[06:41:52] <R13ose> frank_o_: everyone does jsfiddle's?
[06:41:58] <R13ose> pheas: thanks.
[06:42:02] <Zamp1> http://fane.co/live_mark/layout.html
[06:42:03] <Zamp1> :)
[06:42:12] <Zamp1> Hosted it on my server for you.
[06:42:12] <frank_o_> R13ose: yes. it's #jquery 101
[06:42:25] <R13ose> frank_o_: okay
[06:42:26] <Zamp1> http://fane.co/live_mark/ no index so i figured layout.html was 'index' :-)
[06:42:30] <Mark__> sweet.
[06:42:31] <Zamp1> @Mark__
[06:42:46] <Mark__> are you a genius or something?
[06:42:58] <Zamp1> Not really most likely just as smart as everyone else here :P
[06:43:09] <Mark__> im too dumb :( sigh
[06:43:19] <frank_o_> Mark__: jsfiddle is where you can run your html, css and js on the fly. if you used that, Zamp1 wouldnt have to go through the trouble to put your code up on his side :S
[06:43:28] <Zamp1> I mean i can freelance you project :P
[06:43:30] <frank_o_> * his site
[06:43:31] <Zamp1> Not an issue frank :)
[06:43:35] <Zamp1> just  asimple drag and drop for me.
[06:44:08] <Zamp1> Mark what exactly are you trying to build here? Maybe i can help.
[06:44:32] <Mark__> well, at the moment im not all too sure.
[06:44:45] <Mark__> but right now, i just have to get blur.js working.
[06:45:30] <Zamp1> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://fane.co/live_mark/layouts/layout_blur/js/blur.min.js
[06:45:43] <Zamp1> so im assumign you haven't properly included blur.min.js :)
[06:45:44] <Mark__> i need to blur the backgound image of the content layer using the blur.min.js, not the entire background image.
[06:46:13] <Zamp1> Okay one sec :-)
[06:46:26] <Mark__> http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/layouts/layout_blur/js/blur.min.js
[06:46:30] <Mark__> this is the address.
[06:46:59] <Zamp1> Alright :)
[06:47:33] <Zamp1> http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!jquery.blurjs might be a bit easier to use as its a CDN for that image :)
[06:47:53] <shoky> Mark__ did you add a document.ready handler for that blurjs init code
[06:48:20] <Mark__> no. i don’t know what that document.ready handler is.
[06:48:31] <Mark__> i only coded following the guideline.
[06:48:39] <Mark__> http://blurjs.com/
[06:48:41] <shoky> ugh
[06:48:48] <shoky> then go learn jquery, from the top
[06:48:58] <Zamp1> $( document ).ready(function() {
[06:48:58] <Zamp1>   // Handler for .ready() called.
[06:48:58] <Zamp1> });
[06:49:01] <Mark__> sigh. i know, i planning to.
[06:49:06] <Mark__> html5 and jquery.
[06:49:14] <Zamp1> that init's the code for use i believe :) i'm a backend engineer so not to sure of front end stuff :)
[06:49:38] <Mark__> i miss the back and old days where everyone was using flash and photoshop instead of jquery and html5
[06:49:42] <Mark__> too complicated.
[06:49:47] <R13ose> pheas: can I pm you?
[06:49:54] <shoky> too complicated? you didn't even read the first lesson
[06:50:08] <Mark__> well. im a bad student.
[06:50:11] <Mark__> ;(
[06:50:15] <Zamp1> Mark__ If you can write our a project proposal for what you need done i can do it :P
[06:50:18] <shoky> work on that
[06:50:19] <Zamp1> out*
[06:50:37] <Zamp1> Seems your project has no guideline or more or less clear vision :) for us to understandY
[06:50:42] <Zamp1> You're just giving us the errors and such;p
[06:50:51] <Mark__> thanks for the offer, but i have no cash at the moment.
[06:50:52] <shoky> he just wants us to do things for him
[06:51:01] <Mark__> and i only really get that js working really.
[06:51:10] <Mark__> shoky and zamp you guys work together?
[06:51:10] <Zamp1> yeah i know;p
[06:51:18] <shoky> uh not that i know of ;p
[06:51:33] <Zamp1> No i live in USA Junior Software Engineer @ SHG Ing :P
[06:51:35] <Zamp1> Inc*
[06:51:58] <Mark__> and the website im currently coding isn’t remotely close to business
[06:52:01] <Mark__> so.
[06:52:02] <Mark__> i see.

[06:56:16] <R13ose> Zamp1: what does SHC Inc do?
[06:56:59] <R13ose> Mag-neto: did you look at the console errors?
[06:59:37] <Mark__> it’s 11o clock here
[06:59:43] <Mark__> i should probably get some sleep
[06:59:46] <Mark__> ;p
[07:00:01] <Mark__> have fun coding!
[07:01:16] <pheas> R13ose: i think i got let me just look on a different computer
[07:01:36] <R13ose> pheas: thanks
[07:01:44] <frank_o_> Mark__: hey
[07:01:53] <Mark__> ?
[07:02:26] <frank_o_> Mark__: i cant get blurjs to work either
[07:02:32] <frank_o_> Mark__: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/z87u2ykp/
[07:02:33] <Mark__> yea, now you know
[07:03:39] <frank_o_> oh wait
[07:04:03] <Mark__> you missed the body part
[07:05:17] <Mag-neto> R13ose console error???
[07:05:45] <Mark__> your random backgorund images scare me
[07:05:45] <Mark__> lol
[07:06:36] <R13ose> Mag-neto: jQuery is not defined.  Why are you using No-Library (pure JS)?
[07:07:16] <frank_o_> Mark__: im getting this error: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17743033/external-javascript-library-error-blur-js
[07:07:39] <frank_o_> damnit
[07:08:48] <Mark__> ah
[07:09:27] <Mark__> i think i heard someone saying that it’s only appliable when used on the image that’s in the same domain
[07:12:21] <frank_o_> Mark__: check this out
[07:14:06] <frank_o_> Mark__: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/z87u2ykp/1/ i switched to https://github.com/GianlucaGuarini/Vague.js
[07:15:19] <Mark__> um,
[07:15:51] <Mark__> i don;t think this is necessary related to blur.js is it?
[07:17:15] <R13ose> pheas: any luck?
[07:17:15] <frank_o> Mark__: no fuck blur.js, vague.js looks a lot better
[07:17:18] <frank_o> Mark__: besides id advise against using any libs by jakiestfu, he's pretty much abandoned all his repos and he's impossible to geta hold of
[07:18:33] <Mark__> but this isn;t any different from the webkit-filter:blur
[07:18:37] <Mark__> lol
[07:18:46] <Mark__> thanks for the effort though.
[07:21:35] <pheas> R13ose: u need some way to calculate the width in #slide-3 .col-12
[07:21:56] <frank_o> Mark__: well it uses svg instead of css right? doesnt it satisfy your needs?
[07:22:17] <Mark__> um, it has to be gaussian blur effect on the background
[07:22:18] <pheas> const number isnt working
[07:22:26] <Mark__> like this: http://blurjs.com/
[07:23:29] <pheas> R13ose: on windows i got this long black line on the right side, on linux i only see it on profiles
[07:23:41] <R13ose> pheas: yes but isn't this row that is making the width too large?
[07:25:19] <Mark__> what kind of messengers do web developers use these days?
[07:25:34] <pheas> changing that width dynamically  will change the image to any res
[07:25:35] <Mark__> do poeple still use microsoft messenger?
[07:27:08] <Robdgreat> Mark__: if you mean msn messenger, they've rolled it into skype
[07:27:26] <Mark__> really? how come i still have the msn for mac
[07:27:26] <Mark__> ?
[07:27:34] <Mark__> oh it’s not working
[07:27:49] <pheas> R13ose: do u see that long black line to the left? u wanna screen shot?
[07:28:20] <R13ose> pheas: left, I see the black line on the right.  Yes screen shot please
[07:28:31] <tomchentw> hi, can anyone help me confirm this issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1684
[07:36:32] <pheas> R13ose: sorry i meant the right, i meant  i see line threw out the html opposes to just seeing it in one section on linux
[07:37:10] <pheas> http://postimg.org/image/w6uhxwvzp/
[07:38:36] <R13ose> pheas: I am not sure why that is happening.  I am not sure how to fix any of these.  Did you see the black line in portfolio area?
[07:40:47] <pheas> here is my linux http://postimg.org/image/4plem9vn7/
[07:41:55] <R13ose> pheas: solution is to get the width of #slide-3 .col-12?
[07:44:35] <ashgotti> Good morning all. I'm starting out and having brain pains trying to figure this one out. http://jsfiddle.net/wccznmr3/ I want to autopopulate two fields based on possible values of 3 other fields. I had two different functions and am trying to do it in one function but now it's mucked up
[07:44:51] <ashgotti> If you enter a value in Estimated value, downpayment shouldn't be getting populated, just principle
[07:45:16] <pheas> R13ose: same linux but i changed the width http://postimg.org/image/eeu6lw50j/f2c7ab07/
[07:46:02] <R13ose> pheas: I get this but solution is key
[07:47:21] <ashgotti> And then if you enter a new value in one of the autopulated fields, it does not keep the value
[07:47:34] <pheas> its kinda of a bitch trying to get it to work on all platforms
[07:48:45] <R13ose> pheas: yes but why?
[07:51:41] <R13ose> pheas: I see reasons but there should be solutions which I have been trying to work out with no luck.
[07:54:23] <pheas> R13ose: there is one, iam just not see it
[07:55:07] <pheas> R13ose: i really want to gives those images width other then 100%
[07:55:45] <R13ose> pheas: Yes but that wouldn't make them responsive
[07:57:29] <pheas> how about spaces for in between columns
[07:58:21] <R13ose> pheas: nope, they need to be the way they are not.  Why can't the jQuery code be changed?
[08:02:26] <frank_o> shoky: any idea why I can't run `$.fn.doSomething($(this));` inside the callback? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ttLjxxaw/7/
[08:02:28] <pheas> R13ose: u can use jquery  to calulatue the width in #slide-3 .col-12 so it can match most resolutions , the hover event still matches up and stuff
[08:02:45] <pheas> u just gotta do a little math
[08:05:05] <R13ose> pheas: yes but do you see the width of row?
[08:05:38] <shoky> frank_o why is that on $.fn ?  also.. "this" changes inside functions (you're inside the done callback there)
[08:06:38] <pheas> R13ose: the row width is 2623 right?
[08:07:00] <shoky> frank_o  http://jsfiddle.net/ttLjxxaw/8/
[08:07:01] <pheas> .5
[08:12:10] <R13ose> pheas: yes and mine is 2486px
[08:15:46] <pheas> R13ose: Iam  not an expert in design
[08:16:18] <pheas> are u part of the web designer team, that is mentioned on the site
[08:16:19] <R13ose> pheas: yes but all I want is the black line to go away depending on the screen resolution
[08:16:40] <R13ose> pheas: yes
[08:21:07] <pheas> R13ose: try this
[08:21:36] <ManicPanic> hello, why do i get this error in console all the time? --> GET http://localhost/GNX_UI/tests/TABS/jquery-2.0.3.min.map 404 (Not Found)
[08:21:58] <pheas> remove the width style from <div class="row" style="width:?">
[08:22:28] <pheas> and set  #slide-3 .col-12 width to 33.33%
[08:22:45] <shoky> ManicPanic you can ignore it, it means the browser is trying to fetch the source-map file for jquery, which is just for easier debugging. it only happens when the devtools are on
[08:23:32] <ManicPanic> shoky: yes devtools are on, but how do i ignore that error message?
[08:23:49] <shoky> ManicPanic: by moving on
[08:24:18] <ManicPanic> shoky: huh? you mean keep it as is?
[08:24:22] <pheas> R13ose: nevermind dont do that
[08:25:03] <R13ose> pheas: ok
[08:25:19] <shoky> ManicPanic: yes. or get that .map file and put it on your server, then devtools will find it
[08:25:21] <ManicPanic> shoky: ok , just dont want the client console to be clogged by this
[08:25:35] <guy> I need to assign a reference from one element to another. Does jQuery expose whatever internal ID for this, or should just do it by reference, e.g. $('<foo>').data('bar', $('bar')[0]);
[08:25:39] <guy> ?
[08:25:52] <ManicPanic> shoky: ok will do that thanx
[08:26:45] <pheas> R13ose: sorrry do do that, it works for me
[08:29:02] <pheas> R13ose: change the firefox size and it adjusted
[08:31:25] <R13ose> pheas: two things, the size of the image is stretched if you do that on desktop if the size of your screen is huge and for mobile the images are too small.
[08:40:16] <pheas> R13ose: is giving slide-2 a white background out of the question?
[08:41:24] <R13ose> pheas: yes
[08:43:21] <frank_o> shoky: so sorry, bad connection here
[08:43:26] <R13ose> pheas: did you see: $('#slide-3 .row').css('width', gallery_width ); in the jQuery code
[08:43:32] <pheas> R13ose: you must be pulling out your hair at this point, iam about too
[08:43:47] <R13ose> pheas: look at the code above
[08:44:07] <frank_o> R13ose: damn, you guys still struggling??
[08:44:18] <R13ose> yes
[08:58:57] <R13ose> pheas: any other thoughts?
[08:58:59] <pheas> R13ose: umm i took out my phone to see, it looks very nice
[08:59:17] <shoky> frank_o welp donno if you got my msg- <shoky> frank_o why is that on $.fn ?  also.. "this" changes inside functions (you're inside the done callback there)  <shoky> frank_o  http://jsfiddle.net/ttLjxxaw/8/
[08:59:37] <R13ose> pheas: yes but the desktop one has the black lines.  Did you see the jQuery code I posted and/or look at the jQuery file?
[09:00:51] <pheas> holding the phone on its side shows black space on both size, that is out of the question on the destop right ?
[09:00:57] <pheas> yeah i saw it
[09:02:56] <pheas> i dont see any solution to it
[09:02:59] <guy> How do I check if variable is an instance of a jQuery selector?
[09:03:14] <guy> Surprisingly didn't find an answer on Google.
[09:03:29] <R13ose> pheas: This is out of the question.  Once the desktop is fixed, I can see if mobile looks good or not.
[09:03:36] <guy> "obj instanceof jQuery" is too broad
[09:03:41] <R13ose> pheas: nothing you see in jQuery that can change?
[09:04:47] <pheas> R13ose: i always wondered why most mobile versions of sites have it's own domain, is it to make things easier ?
[09:05:17] <R13ose> pheas: yes but responsive helps
[09:12:14] <pheas> R13ose: iam thinking i should give up
[09:12:25] <R13ose> pheas: thanks for trying
[09:12:46] <kevin> give up? nevarrrrr
[09:13:30] <pheas> R13ose: do you do free stuff?
[09:13:43] <R13ose> pheas: like?
[09:16:01] <frank_o> shoky: yep all good =)
[09:17:18] <frank_o> shoky: curious though, will http://jsfiddle.net/ttLjxxaw/8/ process one item after the other, or all items at once? having some trouble recreating my issue here
[09:17:45] <pheas> R13ose: i have an open-source search engine, since iam not really a good designer the web interface is blah , would u like to help the opensource world :)
[09:19:02] <R13ose> pheas: I help the open source community all the time.  Do you think your search engine can go against the biggest ones?
[09:19:29] <frank_o> shoky: ie. it should proceed to the next item in the .map only after the previous is done()
[09:19:35] <WeNDoR> hi
[09:19:54] <WeNDoR> does anyone know why by using qunit i get an error like this when testing: /client/tests/tests.js:14: 'null' is not an object (evaluating 'incommingmessage.documentElement.firstChild')
[09:20:00] <WeNDoR> but when i test the code in a browser it works flawlessly ?
[09:20:09] <WeNDoR> it looks like i can't use .documentElement.firstChild on a XML Object. but what can i use then ?
[09:21:56] <frank_o> shoky: are you getting a lot of undefined "ready for action" too? its strange. before when i waited until all were done and then ran a bunch of css functions over them, everything was fine. now with this one-by-one setup everything seems to have gone haywire :S
[09:23:28] <frank_o> on the upside though it's a lot faster
[09:24:38] <pheas> R13ose: its more of a personal use type search engine, Its for people that dont want things stored remotely and would like full control what is stored in th DB
[09:25:28] <R13ose> pheas: what are you searching for?
[09:28:10] <R13ose> pheas: can I search for robots and get the same things as Google give me but better results or something else?
[09:30:30] <frank_o> shoky: brb im sure ill figure it out
[09:31:37] <pheas> R13ose: hmm i just searched for "robots" i got a entry from wikipedia and dictionary.com
[09:33:14] <R13ose> pheas: great.  Does the open source, mean anyone can help code this?
[09:33:15] <shoky> frank_o: it's because you're calling .resolve() with no arguments
[09:33:57] <shoky> frank_o: the argument to .resolve is the value that the promise will be resolved with, i.e. the value that will be passed to the .done callback
[09:34:23] <pheas> R13ose: yeah, since i fell like pretty much done i can release it as beta on github later today
[09:36:53] <frank_o> shoky: what argument am i missing? basically what you did `done: whenDoneItem.resolve` works fine but not `done: function(results) { whenDoneItem.resolve(); /* other stuff */}`
[09:37:10] <R13ose> pheas: right.  What is your goal not letting big companies have control over data or trying to beat the big players or allowing anyone to host this on their server or something else?
[09:37:14] <frank_o> shoky: ooh i got it
[09:37:30] <shoky> frank_o:  when i do  done: whenDoneItem.resolve    then the argument passed to .resolve will be whatever is passed to the "done" callback, i.e. "results"
[09:37:31] <frank_o> shoky: whenDoneItem.resolve(results)
[09:37:46] <shoky> yup
[09:37:56] <frank_o> nice..
[09:38:11] <pheas> if any of you guys want to try it  go here https://69.124.113.52:4132/
[09:38:33] <pheas> R13ose: ill post the crawler data on torrent so any body can host
[09:39:06] <R13ose> pheas: why not github?
[09:39:43] <R13ose> pheas: your connection is not private
[09:40:30] <pheas> umm it is going to github, i just didnt put it here yet
[09:40:47] <R13ose> okay
[09:41:12] <pheas> selfsigned cert sorry
[09:47:53] <R13ose> pheas: I think there would  be a lot of people who would want to help if you get the word out and continue to build this.  I know of a project that works with media and is similar to what you are doing.
[09:48:16] <R13ose> pheas: I have to go for lunch but pm me if you want me to help more and I will get back to you.
[09:49:06] <pheas> R13ose: yeah, ill put it on github after i play smite
[10:48:29] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to crop some YouTube thumbnails but I'm having some selector issues; http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/aj306Lmm/
[10:48:32] <frank_o> How come `$.fn.YouTubeCrop(elem.parent().find('.youtube'));` works fine, but when I do `$.fn.YouTubeCrop(elem.closest('.container').find('.youtube'));`, only the 1st video gets cropped?
[11:34:49] <Kartagis> $(document).on('input change', 'input,select', function () { <--- why did this start giving me 'undefined is a function'?
[11:40:30] <frank_o> shoky: Is that new deferred objects setup we did somehow messing with jQuery's original objects? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/aj306Lmm/6/ -- I got quite a few functions like that and they all seem to be acting very strangely.
[11:42:56] <troop> hello i am gettin reference error for datetimepicker but i think scripts seem to be in right order can you check it please? http://ivmearastirma.com/insankaynaklari last box would be datetimepicker but i get $ is not defined error
[11:55:16] <Kartagis> $(document).on('input change', 'input,select', function () { <--- why did this start giving me 'undefined is a function'?
[11:57:16] <kc_> could be wrong but i think you just need .on('change' and not .on('input change'
[11:57:18] <Kartagis> troop: what field are you talking about=
[11:57:52] <Kartagis> kc_: strange thing is, it was working yesterday
[11:58:55] <Kartagis> kc_: oh I know why. jquery_update module decided to disable itself on drupal
[12:01:45] <kc_> hm, ive just never used it is why i was saying it, i mess with jquery a lot, but no expert
[12:06:26] <WeNDoR> hi

[12:48:10] <dimitrovskif> Hi guys, on IE7 clicking on DIV empty space does not fire .click event

[14:04:46] <Tomashe> hey guys anyone knows a good jquery plugin tha can handle slide buttons ?
[14:04:52] <Tomashe> for mobile
[14:33:22] <frank_o> Hi! Can anybody tell if this deferred objects setup somehow is messing with jQuery's original objects? Ie. `$.fn.elemTest(elem.parent().find('.youtube'));` does find both instances of `.youtube` but the function is only being applied to one of them: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/aj306Lmm/6/
[14:44:25] <ashgotti> Afternoon/evening everyone. I need a bit of help with autopopulating fields based on other fields, with live updates. The way I have it now, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26326990/jquery-autopopulate-fields-math-based, the field values get overwritten but I'm not sure how else to do it
[14:49:20] <ashgotti> I have event calling the calculating function on change because I want to do live calculations, but it creates the problem of overwriting values
[14:59:35] <guy> hm is http://plugins.jquery.com/ closed for submission?
[15:02:16] <shoky> frank_o: it's working for both of them, if you check the DOM you'll see both of them have height: 100px
[15:03:47] <shoky> frank_o: and the commented one searches for all .youtubes inside .container meaning ALL of them.. and btw "elem" is already the .youtube element.. so   elem.parent().find('.youtube') === elem
[15:04:43] <shoky> frank_o: and stop doing that $.fn nonsense, you're doing it wrong.  http://jsfiddle.net/aj306Lmm/7/
[15:08:43] <frank_o> shoky: hey! thanks again man. something is still wrong though, im now working on a new testcase from scratch.
[15:09:18] <frank_o> using $.fn so i can share functions across different js files like application.js, infinitescroll.js etc. i hope thats ok
[15:10:54] <shoky> ugh no it's not. if you must use globals and want them in jquery, put them in $.*  not in $.fn.*
[15:11:13] <shoky> $.fn.*  is for doing stuff like $('a').myFunction()
[15:11:21] <shoky> but you have to know what you're doing
[15:12:33] <frank_o> great.. will read up on that ASAP!
[15:15:17] <z1haze> would someone mind helping me with adding a placeholder attribute to the search bar in datatables

[17:10:44] <funhouse> does anyone know of a good xp meter type plugin that can increase/decrease?
[17:40:03] <doug64k> funhouse: what? xp meter?
[17:58:18] <frank_o> Is it possible to get a callback from `css()` or should I just set a 150ms timeout for things to finish?
[17:58:52] <doug64k> frank_o: css animation?
[17:59:27] <frank_o> doug64k: Nope just setting height and width and stuff. Only thing I've found is http://stackoverflow.com/a/24484924 but I don't know
[18:00:08] <frank_o> (height, width and a bunch of ratio cropping etc.)
[18:00:15] <doug64k> frank_o: css() is instant if there is no animation
[18:00:29] <Ansikt> if you use jQuery.animate, it returns a deferred
[18:01:34] <Ansikt> But if you're just using .css, it's synchronous.
[18:02:02] <frank_o> Well, here's my function -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/wa85nfd5/1/ -- it's basically for getting rid of those annoying black bars in YouTube thumbnails. I need to know exactly when all that's done
[18:02:46] <doug64k> frank_o: all that is done immediately
[18:06:23] <doug64k> frank_o: maybe this is what you meant? http://jsfiddle.net/wa85nfd5/2/
[18:07:17] <frank_o_> sorry got dc'ed
[18:07:28] <doug64k> frank_o_: http://jsfiddle.net/wa85nfd5/2/ ?
[18:07:54] <doug64k> the .on should be .one - that part waits for css animation to end
[18:08:03] <doug64k> the promise thing waits for jquery animation(s) to end
[18:08:27] <doug64k> probably wont work if there are no css animations involved
[18:08:50] <frank_o_> no animations, just what's there
[18:09:13] <frank_o_> right after that function i'm hiding `element` and it seems theres a few nanoseconds standing in the way
[18:09:40] <Getty> i tell you guys.... bytes and javascript is something REALLY f**ked up 8-)
[18:09:43] <frank_o_> unless i add a 250ms timeout
[18:11:40] <frank_o_> 100ms
[18:12:04] <frank_o_> im cool with that for now. thanks a lot fam

[21:41:55] <greenshirt> hello
[21:42:10] <greenshirt> i have simple question about jquery number format
[22:44:53] <calamity> Hi. I'm aware there are some limitations with regard to the Same-Origin Policy, but I'm wondering if there's a way that I can apply a jquery redirect to an iframe which contains content from an external site?
[23:03:00] <Kartagis> hi
[23:05:18] <Kartagis> the other day I was trying to ask why I get  $$ as a hint when I type $ in the console, and nobody seemed to get what I mean. here is what I mean: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11918318/Screenshot%20from%202014-10-13%2009%3A01%3A52.png
[23:36:45] <reactormonk> How do you select elements from the object returned by other selectors? E.g. $(".foo").css(".bar") doesn't work
[23:37:30] <z3l> Hello.
[23:44:09] <Kartagis> reactormonk: I'm far from knowledgable enough, but $($(".foo).css(".bar") might do it?
[23:44:24] <Kartagis> lack of parentheses
[23:48:19] <reactormonk> Kartagis, gives me an error on css not a function
[23:48:20] <z3l> I wonder why function() is not accessible, after I append `<a onclick="javascript:function();">` to div block, using html() method. I'd be very grateful if someone answers.
[23:48:35] <Kartagis> hrm
[23:48:43] <Kartagis> that proves my point
[23:48:54] <Kartagis> I'm not knowledgable enough
