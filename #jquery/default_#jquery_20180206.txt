[04:52:58] <devi8> so now I have seen a new nomenclature for delegation:  $(".next").on("click", { d: "n" }, rotate);
[04:53:23] <devi8> what is {d:"n"} in this formula?
[04:53:53] <Cork> devi8: that isn't delegate
[04:54:03] <devi8> great...what is it?
[04:54:16] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:54:28] <Cork> argument before the handler
[04:54:46] <devi8> that is coool as hell. I have never seen that before.
[04:55:09] <devi8> thanks
[04:55:39] <Cork> never found it very useful my self
[04:55:57] <Cork> it structures for many duplicate event handlers
[04:56:06] <Cork> as the data doesn't differ per element it is triggering on
[04:56:08] <devi8> https://codepen.io/nopr/pen/rfBJx
[04:56:18] <devi8> that's where I saw it
[04:56:45] <Cork> devi8: ya, but if it was added on the element line 4 and 5 could be one line
[04:57:00] <Cork> so again, i never gotten the point of the data attribute
[04:57:04] <Cork> *argument
[04:57:25] <localh0st> devi8: anyway, he's not using event
[04:57:56] <localh0st> so he could just canll .on("click", rotate("n"));
[04:58:08] <Cork> no you can't...
[04:58:29] <Cork> that would execute rotate instead of binding them as a handler
[05:00:01] <localh0st> ah, ok
[05:00:25] <localh0st> sorry
[08:28:10] <Guest8> Hey guys, is there a jquery location which has all files in a flat directory? I'd like to download all versions from http://code.jquery.com/jquery/, but I'd have to scrape the web page
[08:29:03] <Duikb00t> It's not easy oO
[08:29:11] <Duikb00t> Guest8:  why?
[08:29:31] <Duikb00t> https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery/
[08:30:01] <Duikb00t> Take the dropdown prepend the url from the cdn
[08:30:09] <Duikb00t> wget thaturl.js bam ready
[08:30:15] <Duikb00t> but why the hell would you ever need to do that.
[08:30:16] <Duikb00t> ;
[08:30:30] <Duikb00t> Or make some nice shell script wich does that work  furu
[08:33:40] <Guest8> I have a script which downloads them all, but my organization does not want the burden to maintain that script and what if the site changes, etc, etc
[08:33:57] <Guest8> I'm looking for a flat directory which I can mirror
[08:35:51] <Duikb00t> ... just use cdnjs
[08:35:56] <Duikb00t> mirror that one or whatever
[08:52:31] <undefined_bob> "TypeError: e.indexOf is not a function" but I dont have e.indexOf in my code
[08:52:51] <undefined_bob> or is that something like a general error?
[08:58:06] <undefined_bob> the debugger point me to this code:
[08:58:06] <undefined_bob> var image = new Image();
[08:58:06] <undefined_bob>  $(image).load(function() {
[08:58:15] <undefined_bob> but I see nothing wrong there
[09:03:20] <Cork> undefined_bob: check what error line it comes from
[09:03:41] <Cork> undefined_bob: it is most likely cause you give something to jquery that it doesn't expect and it then try to use it as an array
[09:04:00] <Cork> (doesn't mean the error is in jquery, but in what you provide it)
[09:06:42] <undefined_bob> Cork: the console said the error come from the $(image).load(function() { line
[09:07:07] <Cork> undefined_bob: can you reproduce in a jsfiddle?
[09:07:08] <undefined_bob> I try to make a test case, maybe I see the error then
[09:07:17] <Cork> perfect
[09:22:29] <undefined_bob> Cork: couldn't reproduce the code in a fiddle but you can see the code and error on my testpage http://undefined.bplaced.net/
[09:22:41] <undefined_bob> when you click on the tree image
[09:23:40] <undefined_bob> I think the error maybe is because invalid width and high values I give to jquery
[09:28:31] <thykka> undefined_bob, the syntax for .load() is .load( url [, data] [, complete] )
[09:28:36] <thykka> and you have .load(function() {})
[09:29:33] <undefined_bob> that isnt even my code. its from a library?
[09:29:54] <thykka> assets/common.js/ line 458
[09:30:27] <undefined_bob> I think its because I specify the width and high of the image in vw and vh but the jquery expect it in px? could that be?
[09:31:04] <thykka> sure, ignore the actual cause and invent a new one :)
[09:31:15] <undefined_bob> no no I didnt want that
[09:31:48] <undefined_bob> I was just thinking because I know the code worked before
[09:32:50] <undefined_bob> and all I changed was the width and height from px to vh. thats what confusing me
[09:37:31] <Cork> undefined_bob: it is the event code in jquery that crashes
[09:39:38] <undefined_bob> you mean this .on('click', function(e) { ?
[09:39:52] <undefined_bob> and thanks for taking time to look into it
[09:40:27] <Cork> undefined_bob: can you replace jquery.min with a none min version?
[09:41:17] <Cork> but it is $(image).load(function() { that fails for some reason; i don't have a good answer why before i have an unminified version
[09:41:48] <undefined_bob> yes I think I can replace that
[09:41:54] <Cork> thykka: also http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[09:49:58] <undefined_bob> still crashed for me
[09:50:27] <undefined_bob> hm
[09:52:38] <Cork> ah
[09:52:48] <Cork> undefined_bob: .load as an event binder is removed in 3.x
[09:52:55] <Cork> use .on('load', func)
[09:53:26] <undefined_bob> ohh
[09:53:38] <Cork> i forgot that most of the old short hands are removed in 3.x
[09:53:53] <undefined_bob> why have they done that?
[09:54:16] <Cork> undefined_bob: cause it is unneeded code
[09:54:48] <Cork> the load function to fetch data remotely has to check if the first argument is a function, and if it is send the data to .on()
[09:55:03] <Cork> and that is not plesant code to maintain
[09:55:22] <Cork> also .on() is short enough that there is no need to support the shorthands
[09:55:34] <Cork> it is just 4 extra characters you lose in the shorthand
[09:56:47] <undefined_bob> so it would be
[09:56:48] <undefined_bob> $(image).on('load', func) {
[09:56:48] <undefined_bob> instead of
[09:56:48] <undefined_bob> $(image).load(function() {
[09:56:58] <Cork> no
[09:57:08] <Cork> $(image).on('load', function() {
[09:57:13] <undefined_bob> aw :(
[09:57:26] <Cork> the rest is the same
[09:59:33] <undefined_bob> thank you Cork I dont know why jQuery/JavaScript are so difficult to understand for me
[10:00:14] <Cork> undefined_bob: might be cause it isn't a class oriented language like most other oo languages are
[10:01:27] <undefined_bob> maybe my brain is just not made for javascript :o
[10:06:35] <undefined_bob> now it works again :) http://undefined.bplaced.net/
[10:06:54] <undefined_bob> thanks again
[10:17:26] <treepalm> I've created a simple form in HTML on Bootstrap, what I want to do is return a JSON containing the information posted in the form and submit it on a local server. I've started creating a Server.js with Express handling the post requests and a custom script that generates the JSON from the HTML input... But it seems that with jQuery is a way simpler task, handling AJAX request and JSON... Can you give me some suggestions on how to procede?
[10:17:27] <treepalm> Thanks
[10:18:46] <__rob> hello
[10:18:54] <__rob> can anyone tell me what the callback url is for with OAuth
[10:21:16] <localh0st> treepalm: you can use serilize your form http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ and then use ajax to post it
[10:26:55] <treepalm> hi localh0st thanks for your suggestion  ! :-) I’m new to jquery.. serialize is interesting but it seems to me it doesnt create a JSON… isnt’t there a direct way with jQuery?
[10:29:39] <localh0st> treepalm: ay, my mistake : https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[10:29:45] <treepalm> do you think this one would work? http://www.developerdrive.com/2013/04/turning-a-form-element-into-json-and-submiting-it-via-jquery/
[10:30:10] <treepalm> localh0st: ahh serializeArray! exactly.. it uses it in guide above
[10:30:40] <treepalm> but shouldnt the ajax request be handled by the server.js ???
[10:35:50] <tsukasadt> treepalm, You can setup the .serilaizeArray() and $.ajax() in your server.js file, if that's how you're breaking it up, but that is only to submit the content, you need to have a server-side system to process the content.
[10:45:06] <treepalm> the server side I already have it, I just need to return a JSON containing the information from the contents from the Form
[10:45:26] <undefined_bob> nice evening for you guys and thanks again
[10:54:28] <htmled> Hello, how can I get a getUserMedia program to use the rear camera as default when available, but if it's not then just use the default camera? Here's my code: https://jsbin.com/bajifisumi/edit?html,output
[11:06:21] <htmled>  Unfortunately, I cannot test the page if it's working since I do not have access to a device with a backfacing camera. Can someone test if this page works with the back camera on a 2 camera device? https://jsbin.com/bajifisumi/edit?html,output
[11:19:24] <lissitzki> hi jquerist
[11:19:55] <lissitzki> i have a menu with submenus, https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/
[11:20:17] <lissitzki> trying to have a jquery toggling the submenus
[11:21:13] <lissitzki> because the menu structure is quite fixed, I wonder if i can tell jquery to act only on trigger's children and not on all the elements with the same classes
[11:21:46] <lissitzki> because i have elements that are children of different parents and have same classes
[11:34:13] <grapheti> lissitzki, https://jsfiddle.net/graphettion/q1dcbwnf/3/
[11:35:29] <htmled> grapheti: ^^
[11:37:08] <grapheti> htmled, do you have a jquery question?
[11:37:47] <htmled> grapheti: Yeah pretty much, I just need to test my page on a phone with a back and front facing camera. I need to know if it's using the back facing camera. https://jsbin.com/bajifisumi/edit?html,output
[11:38:00] <lissitzki> grapheti, thanks, why in your code .nav > .sub-menu?
[11:38:06] <htmled> grapheti: The page uses jQuery with javascript and html, etc
[11:38:38] <lissitzki> ok i got it
[11:38:42] <grapheti> lissitzki: It's just more specific
[11:38:55] <htmled> grapheti: Sorry, it's not jQuery actually after I just checked it but if you could please help me that would be great
[11:39:08] <grapheti> htmled: I don't have time to test it on a mobile device :/
[11:39:17] <htmled> grapheti: Ah
[11:39:23] <lissitzki> ok i need to use well $(this).children
[11:39:24] <htmled> alright, thanks anyway
[11:39:31] <lissitzki> and .parent()
[11:39:50] <grapheti> htmled: someone may have time in here
[11:40:10] <htmled> grapheti: Hopefully
[11:42:42] <grapheti> lissitzki: use console.log to understand want is happening
[12:30:10] <devi8> Hey all, I am trying to capture the scroll event on some text and determine which of it's children are visible and which are not. Is there a "good" or "easy" way to do this?
[12:31:39] <devi8> I was thinking I would cache the position().top values for each article in a data object and compare the scrollTop() value to the data object to determine which were visible. But maybe there's a better way?
[12:55:19] <MikeD_> .is(":visible")
[12:56:35] <MikeD_> hmm... nevermind, that doesn't do what i thought it did
[13:16:23] <robertmaxrees> goooooood morning
[14:05:16] <lissitzki> need some advice on this https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/
[14:05:56] <lissitzki> the element shown on hover is not the one i want
[14:06:02] <lissitzki> but the children of that element
[14:09:51] <lissitzki> hi taplar_,
[14:09:57] <robertmaxrees> lissitzki you can't repeat IDs
[14:10:09] <taplar_> evening
[14:10:29] <lissitzki> hi robertmaxrees
[14:10:42] <lissitzki> what do you suggest?
[14:10:54] <robertmaxrees> use classes inmstead.
[14:10:59] <lissitzki> i can transform the id in classes
[14:11:02] <lissitzki> yeah
[14:11:06] <robertmaxrees> well.
[14:11:14] <robertmaxrees> do you even need those numeric IDs in the first place?
[14:11:24] <robertmaxrees> could you add classes that better describe what they hold for content?
[14:19:52] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/
[14:20:05] <lissitzki> well i'm using now .depth-1 or -2 or -3
[14:20:18] <robertmaxrees> so
[14:20:20] <lissitzki> this is automatically generated by another script
[14:20:21] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the depths
[14:20:38] <lissitzki> because there are three levels
[14:21:00] <lissitzki> i don't know how to make a difference between the first level , the second and the third
[14:21:25] <lissitzki> each one should be shown at click on the relative parent
[14:21:36] <robertmaxrees> not mouseenter?
[14:22:15] <lissitzki> no, but for testing is faster
[14:22:34] <robertmaxrees> heh, hover isn't doing what you think it is there :)
[14:23:05] <lissitzki> it should be mouseenter?
[14:23:19] <robertmaxrees> i would just use click since that's what you really want.
[14:23:50] <lissitzki> ok
[14:24:01] <robertmaxrees> also: if ( $(submenu).is(":hidden") ) {
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> you sure that's what you want?
[14:24:46] <lissitzki> no, probablly i don't need an if statement
[14:24:55] <robertmaxrees> also also: $ischildren.parent().click(function(e) {
[14:24:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:25:13] <lissitzki> not 'on'?
[14:25:15] <robertmaxrees> that makes $(this) the body element.
[14:25:24] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you binding to js--submenu?
[14:25:26] <lissitzki> (e) ?
[14:25:35] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:25:47] <robertmaxrees> $ischildren.parent() is getting the body in that fiddle.
[14:26:12] <lissitzki> so i'm getting lost
[14:26:27] <robertmaxrees> I'm saying your event handler isn't doing what you think it's doing.
[14:26:38] <lissitzki> yup
[14:26:53] <robertmaxrees> because the event handler is bound to the body of the page in that fiddle.
[14:26:55] <lissitzki> infact is not doing it
[14:27:03] <lissitzki> ah ok
[14:27:24] <robertmaxrees> and then you do  $(this).children(".depth-2, .depth-3  .has-children");
[14:27:53] <robertmaxrees> .children() only goes one level deep, which mean you're getting nothing.
[14:28:13] <lissitzki> i see
[14:28:54] <lissitzki> so first, ischildren is not my right selector
[14:29:28] <robertmaxrees> you want to do something every time a submenu link is clicked, right?
[14:30:10] <lissitzki> i want to show the submenus when the name is clicked, but there are different structure
[14:30:21] <robertmaxrees> gotta go.  meeting.
[14:30:22] <robertmaxrees> bbiab.
[14:30:27] <lissitzki> ok
[14:30:29] <lissitzki> thanks
[14:31:28] <lissitzki> :(
[14:34:30] <ante-up> Hey guys, how can I go about diagnosing my issue here? I'm trying to push events with a certain class name to an array, so I can filter them in FullCalender.io.
[14:34:31] <ante-up> https://bpaste.net/show/6f1bb29b7f0e
[14:35:07] <ante-up> I get no errors, I can log a 'test' on click of the checkbox, but can't seem to check the array with alert or console.logs
[14:36:35] <taplar_> console.log(event.className);  i feel like you're wanting the className off of the event.target instead
[14:38:59] <ante-up> Should I be console.logging it on the click, or when it checks if the checkbox is checked?
[14:39:36] <taplar_> right before line 9
[14:40:46] <ante-up> nope, nothing. Only wants to log that 'test'
[14:41:08] <taplar_> ok, so now try just logging some string and see if you see it instead
[14:42:15] <ante-up> nope, just the test one still
[14:42:27] <taplar_> any errors in the console?
[14:42:40] <ante-up> I even tried clicking the checkbox a couple times to see if it wasn't firing
[14:43:06] <ante-up> only a moment.js warning about not using ISO format, but that seems unrelated
[14:43:36] <taplar_> ok, so just to be sure, put a console.log of some string as the first line of that method
[14:43:47] <taplar_> if you don't see it print out, then that suggests that method is not being invoked
[14:44:16] <ante-up> put it in the render, or before the render? the render method gets called on load
[14:44:38] <taplar_> as the first thing you do inside eventRender
[14:45:08] <taplar_> https://fullcalendar.io/docs/  i don't see 'eventRender' in here
[14:45:14] <taplar_> i do see 'renderEvent'
[14:45:36] <taplar_> nvm, i see it
[14:45:59] <ante-up> oh shoot
[14:46:09] <ante-up> i think I figured it out
[14:46:53] <ante-up> man, I'm so stupid.
[14:47:09] <taplar_> ?
[14:47:45] <ante-up> I forgot with fullcalendar, that you name the event types + their colors in an event render function, so I had 2. It can only run one as the render. So it was coloring my fields, but not letting them be toggle
[14:49:18] <lissitzki> anybody can check this? https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/
[14:50:44] <taplar_> what's the issue?
[14:52:22] <lissitzki> can't reach my taret, showing the submenu at click. I cannot change html structure
[14:52:47] <lissitzki> and there is sometimes one sometimes two submenu
[14:53:03] <lissitzki> and the jquery i did is wrong i think
[14:53:13] <ante-up> Thanks for talkin that out with me Tap, always helpful! Have a good day
[14:53:32] <taplar_> ante-up: glad you figured it out, :). i dunno much about fullcalendar
[14:53:47] <ante-up> That makes two of us xD
[14:54:06] <taplar_> lissitzki: i don't really see this fiddle doing anything, other than i click a link and it tries to go some place
[14:54:18] <taplar_> i don't see any of your show/hide stuff happening
[14:54:23] <lissitzki> exactly
[14:54:57] <taplar_> alright, so time to start debugging.  what is $ischildren.parent() ?
[14:55:31] <lissitzki> is the parent of .js-submenu
[14:55:41] <taplar_> but what is that?
[14:55:56] <taplar_> and why are you trying to grab the parent?
[14:56:40] <lissitzki> it was a way to tell if this link has children show them to me when i click you
[14:57:00] <lissitzki> now .js--submenu is a li
[14:57:32] <taplar_> so the parent is?
[14:57:38] <lissitzki> ul
[14:57:48] <taplar_> what about the top most li?
[14:57:57] <taplar_> i don't see a ul around it
[14:58:13] <lissitzki> it is a parent as well, no?
[14:58:30] <taplar_> you said you are trying to get the parents of the elements
[14:58:38] <lissitzki> yes the top most li
[14:58:49] <taplar_> if that li doesn't have a wrapped ul, it's parent would be whatever it is the child of, in this case, the body
[14:59:33] <taplar_> parent() doesn't retrieve the 'top most'.  it retrieves the immediate parent
[14:59:54] <lissitzki> ok
[15:00:02] <lissitzki> so ul is the parent of li
[15:00:15] <lissitzki> so my strategy is incorrect
[15:00:15] <taplar_> except in this fiddle the outer most lis don't have a ul
[15:00:17] <taplar_> should they?
[15:00:21] <lissitzki> no
[15:00:23] <lissitzki> they don't
[15:00:39] <taplar_> html wise, li's are expected to belong to a ul or an ol
[15:00:51] <lissitzki> ah actually they have
[15:00:56] <lissitzki> let me re paste it
[15:01:37] <taplar_> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-li-element   ul, ol, or menu, apparently.  never used menu before, interesting
[15:02:33] <lissitzki> now the fiddle has a top ul
[15:02:41] <taplar_> link?
[15:02:58] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/
[15:03:30] <taplar_> i don't see the ul
[15:03:42] <taplar_> that's the same one you linked before
[15:03:57] <lissitzki> try this https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/7/
[15:04:10] <lissitzki> i thought set as a base could do the trick
[15:04:14] <lissitzki> anyway
[15:04:56] <taplar_> ok, so now, you're clicking the link and it's transitioning
[15:05:12] <taplar_> should it?
[15:05:28] <lissitzki> i'm just interested in the two in black, the one that has no link
[15:05:41] <lissitzki> because they should be trigger for the jquery
[15:05:58] <taplar_> the .has-children ones?
[15:06:10] <lissitzki> yes
[15:06:19] <taplar_> but you're not targeting those
[15:06:33] <taplar_> you're targeting the .js--submenu
[15:07:01] <lissitzki> well because the children of has-children are js-submenu
[15:07:16] <lissitzki> so i was trying to target their parents
[15:07:20] <taplar_> so?
[15:07:41] <lissitzki> but it is not working
[15:07:46] <taplar_> the ones you want to do this click logic on are the ones related to has-children.
[15:07:55] <taplar_> so there isn't a need to target the others
[15:08:40] <lissitzki> yes
[15:08:47] <lissitzki> so i'm changing the selector

[15:11:06] <lissitzki> i've changed the selecor
[15:11:38] <lissitzki> so now the function is on click on has-children elemtss
[15:11:58] <taplar_> alright, so, question.  is that accurate?  clicking has-children means clicking the li
[15:12:06] <taplar_> which could be any where within that li
[15:12:23] <lissitzki> no, it should be li > h4 > a
[15:12:30] <taplar_> :)
[15:12:47] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/10/
[15:13:08] <taplar_> look at your selector
[15:13:12] <taplar_> there is an issue
[15:14:32] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/11/
[15:14:34] <lissitzki> got it
[15:15:20] <lissitzki> now i should debug the function
[15:19:22] <lissitzki> well I'm not sure $(this) is working as supposed ot
[15:22:26] <taplar_> so what is 'this'?
[15:24:56] <lissitzki> the var itself i suppose
[15:25:23] <taplar_> ok, heh.
[15:25:31] <taplar_> when i ask what something is, i mean what is it actually
[15:25:44] <taplar_> what in the dom is it representing
[15:25:48] <lissitzki> haschildren
[15:26:00] <taplar_> elaborate?
[15:26:02] <lissitzki> sorry no
[15:26:44] <lissitzki> $haschildren that is clicked
[15:26:46] <taplar_> how can you find out what it actually is?
[15:27:07] <lissitzki> i don't know
[15:27:12] <lissitzki> console?
[15:27:14] <taplar_> you can console.log() it
[15:27:17] <lissitzki> yes
[15:27:24] <taplar_> or you could put a debugger statement in there to look at it
[15:31:34] <lissitzki>     console.log($(this))
[15:31:38] <lissitzki> no output
[15:31:45] <taplar_> just console.log(this) for now
[15:32:26] <lissitzki> window
[15:32:38] <lissitzki> this is the answer
[15:32:44] <lissitzki> to console.log
[15:33:51] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/q1dcbwnf/13/
[15:34:57] <lissitzki> <a>
[15:35:21] <taplar_> yep
[15:36:43] <lissitzki> i put your code in my window and console.log do not give answer
[15:37:20] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/15/
[15:37:24] <lissitzki> i don't know
[15:37:29] <taplar_> that code binds a click handler to an element.  you have to click the element for the log to happen
[15:37:45] <lissitzki> got it
[15:37:48] <taplar_> but regardless.  you see that the 'this' is the 'a' element you clicked in the fiddle
[15:38:07] <lissitzki> yes
[15:38:13] <lissitzki> interesting
[15:38:26] <taplar_> which makes sense right/
[15:38:27] <taplar_> ?
[15:38:33] <taplar_> cause that's what your selector is selecting
[15:38:43] <lissitzki> yup
[15:39:08] <taplar_> ok, so, now that you know what the 'this' is, what's the next step?
[15:39:44] <lissitzki> mmh so wait, <a> can't have children
[15:40:18] <taplar_> it technically can, but yours do not
[15:40:48] <taplar_> just think about what you want to happen, and look at your markup
[15:40:56] <taplar_> you got links above sub menus, right?
[15:41:20] <lissitzki> yes
[15:41:36] <taplar_> and when you click a link, you want to toggle the following submenu, yes?
[15:41:47] <lissitzki> yes
[15:42:06] <lissitzki> iwait but they are not links
[15:42:09] <taplar_> ok, so take a look at the link for AGIR-
[15:42:21] <lissitzki> yes like agir is not a link
[15:42:42] <taplar_> how does it relate to the ul you want change, in relation to the dom
[15:43:03] <lissitzki> ul is the next element
[15:43:13] <taplar_> that is incorrect
[15:43:21] <lissitzki> but also ul is inside li
[15:43:21] <taplar_> think in terms of the dom
[15:43:29] <taplar_> elements have parents, children, siblings
[15:43:37] <lissitzki> siblings
[15:43:42] <taplar_> if you started at that link, how would you navigate to the ul?
[15:43:44] <lissitzki> li - li
[15:43:58] <lissitzki> li-> parent ul
[15:44:06] <taplar_> you're not at the li
[15:44:08] <taplar_> you are at the a
[15:44:20] <taplar_> which is inside the h4 inside an li
[15:44:25] <lissitzki> a -> h4 -> li -> ul
[15:44:37] <taplar_> why do you have to go to the li?
[15:44:57] <taplar_> the parent of the a, is the h4
[15:45:05] <taplar_> the next sibling of that h4, is the ul
[15:45:10] <taplar_> yes?
[15:45:17] <lissitzki> ah right
[15:45:49] <lissitzki> a > h4 > ul > li > h4 > a
[15:46:03] <lissitzki> a > h4 >sibling ul > li > h4 > a
[15:46:18] <taplar_> heh, hold on for a second
[15:46:30] <taplar_> think about it
[15:46:43] <taplar_> when you click that a, you want to show the related submenu
[15:46:58] <taplar_> what does 'show the related submenu' mean in terms of the dom?
[15:47:10] <lissitzki> a > h4 >sibling ul
[15:47:21] <taplar_> no, don't think in terms of a selector, this isn't a selector
[15:47:35] <taplar_> and > is a child relation
[15:47:38] <taplar_> a has no children
[15:47:56] <lissitzki> a has a parent h4 that has a sibling ul
[15:47:57] <taplar_> just, logically, what does it mean to 'show' the submenu
[15:48:52] <robertmaxrees> taplar++
[15:48:56] <lissitzki> to show the sibling of the parent of the selector?
[15:49:02] <taplar_> to show the submenu
[15:49:33] <taplar_> why isn't it showing now?
[15:49:53] <lissitzki> because i'm pointing at children of a
[15:50:05] <taplar_> why is the submenu not showing currently?
[15:50:21] <taplar_> i load the page, the submenu is hidden.  why?
[15:50:32] <lissitzki> the class
[15:50:35] <lissitzki> css
[15:50:40] <taplar_> elaborate?
[15:51:17] <lissitzki> thedisplay attribute of ul is set onn none
[15:51:24] <taplar_> alright
[15:51:29] <lissitzki> so i need to change that to show my menu
[15:51:32] <taplar_> so it is hidden because of a property on the ul
[15:51:50] <taplar_> so you are -at- the a, and you need to -get to- the ul
[15:52:02] <taplar_> if you do that, you can change it
[15:52:05] <taplar_> right?
[15:52:09] <lissitzki> yes
[15:52:15] <taplar_> alright, so how do we do that?
[15:52:25] <taplar_> and it's not a selector
[15:52:45] <lissitzki> with .css()?
[15:52:57] <taplar_> css isn't a transition method
[15:53:00] <taplar_> err, traversal
[15:53:12] <taplar_> you have to traverse the dom from the a, to the desired ul
[15:53:28] <lissitzki> with something like .parent()?
[15:53:34] <taplar_> what does that do?
[15:54:01] <lissitzki> .$(this).parent() if it exist I would think it goes to the parent of a
[15:54:12] <taplar_> what does parent() do?
[15:54:12] <lissitzki> of 'this'
[15:54:22] <taplar_> i missed it, yes
[15:54:25] <taplar_> it goes to the parent
[15:54:28] <taplar_> which is what?
[15:54:46] <lissitzki> h4
[15:54:57] <taplar_> ok, so $(this).parent() will get you to the h4
[15:54:59] <taplar_> now what?
[15:55:06] <lissitzki> so it should be something like $(this).parent().siblings()
[15:55:22] <taplar_> that will get you all the siblings.  how many siblings are there?
[15:55:28] <lissitzki> 1
[15:55:35] <taplar_> and that sibling is?
[15:55:39] <lissitzki> ul
[15:55:42] <taplar_> :)
[15:55:48] <lissitzki> yo
[15:56:49] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/17/
[15:57:38] <taplar_> progress! :)
[15:58:37] <taplar_> except
[15:58:45] <taplar_> you said the display none was on the ul
[15:59:54] <lissitzki> yes in fact it doesn't show the menu
[15:59:58] <lissitzki> but some movement
[16:00:10] <taplar_> the display none is not on the ul
[16:01:06] <lissitzki> is on the li
[16:01:24] <taplar_> which, why is it on the lis?
[16:01:29] <lissitzki> i did
[16:01:37] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/18/
[16:01:59] <taplar_> hold on a second
[16:02:12] <taplar_> i'm asking, logically, why are you hiding the lis rather than the ul?
[16:03:02] <taplar_> are you ever going to partially show/hide a submenu?
[16:03:52] <lissitzki> partially, no
[16:03:58] <lissitzki> so i'll do it on ul
[16:04:34] <lissitzki> thnaks man
[16:04:39] <taplar_> np
[16:04:56] <taplar_> you understand a bit more the whole traversing a bit?
[16:05:25] <lissitzki> yes, some lightbulb got on in my head
[16:05:33] <taplar_> good deal
[16:06:11] <lissitzki> tomorrow i'll try to hide one ul when aanother one is shown
[16:06:24] <taplar_> :)
[16:06:47] <lissitzki> i may appear again ahah
[16:11:22] <robertmaxrees> s'what we're here for :)
[16:11:45] <lissitzki> thanks robertmaxrees
[16:12:44] <robertmaxrees> all credit to taplar_ tbh :D
[16:12:47] <robertmaxrees> he's a rockstar.
[16:12:57] <taplar_> you are what you drink
[16:13:08] <lissitzki> he's a great teacher i have to say
[16:14:56] <robertmaxrees> and a great dude overall
[16:15:03] <taplar_> lies
[16:15:40] <lissitzki> big lebowski
[16:16:39] <devi8> in $.fn.doSomething=function (someval) {}    $(this) is the jquery object that called doSomething, right?
[16:17:09] <taplar_> quick console log would tell ya
[16:17:28] <devi8> not really. I keep getting r.fn.init
[16:17:37] <taplar_> you don't need to stick it in $()
[16:17:43] <devi8> even without it.
[16:17:45] <taplar_> within $.fn methods, 'this' is the jquery object already
[16:19:08] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/1evLdkdm/
[16:19:29] <devi8> what's weird is it was working seconds ago. Not sure what I changed, really. https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/WMGMdg
[16:20:48] <robertmaxrees> devi8 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bcxfofLz/
[16:20:53] <robertmaxrees> one way to validate the original question.
[16:22:24] <robertmaxrees> devi8 so what about that doesn't work?
[16:22:56] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/WMGMdg  non-working example
[16:23:44] <robertmaxrees> so what SHOULD happen here?
[16:23:56] <devi8> i forgot .top
[16:24:05] <devi8> I don't know how i erased that.
[16:24:15] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:24:21] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/WMGMdg
[16:25:51] <devi8> taplar, robertmaxrees, thanks for your help. I swear I am getting this and won't bother you any more..soon.
[16:26:08] <taplar_> no biggie
[16:26:35] <robertmaxrees> we're glad to help.
[16:28:50] <devi8> I just copied the working function to my project, thinking it would work and the stangest thing happens. It can't find scrollTop on the scrolling div.
[16:28:51] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/YeGKpN
[16:30:23] <devi8> but you'll notice I did the delegation the way you suggested! (I hope)
[16:30:50] <robertmaxrees> hehj
[16:30:54] <devi8> nvm I am retarded today...
[16:30:59] <robertmaxrees> woah hey
[16:30:59] <robertmaxrees> hehg
[16:31:42] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/YeGKpN
[16:32:41] <taplar_> personal opinion.  that scroll is kinda slow
[16:32:47] <devi8> the problem with being new to coding is that you think that everytime you do a typo, you start refactoring your code. I pledge to start double checking my typos first
[16:33:00] <devi8> I agree. I plan to make the scroll relative to the distance
[16:33:44] <devi8> so long scrolls don't cause epileptic seizures but short scrolls aren't so slow.
[16:34:41] <devi8> but my next fun part is I am going to figure out which articles are visible and highlight their links accordingly when scrolling
[16:35:56] <taplar_> element offsetTop - vertical scroll distance > 0 and < screen height
[16:38:48] <taplar_> the logic throttled on scroll also
[16:45:51] <devi8> got it working...but now I want to figure out how much of the parent height is covered by each element and only show the biggest one (the one whose visible content >50% of its scrollcontainer)
[16:59:50] <robertmaxrees> you're partially there with the logic.
[17:03:04] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/YeGKpN
[17:03:23] <devi8> got it...I think. I need to clean it up some, but at least it works.
[17:05:23] <devi8> just thought of a better way to do this. If I grab the "current" article on scroll and check it, then it's either it or the one before or after. That can be easily determined and will make sure that only one is selected at all times
[17:09:02] <TiffanyAmber> hello
[17:09:27] <TiffanyAmber> How can I make this: $('#shopperExperience' AND '#something' ).on('hidden.bs.collapse', function (event) {      console.log("closed");
[17:09:29] <TiffanyAmber> that AND
[17:10:06] <taplar_afk> are you familiar with css?
[17:10:27] <TiffanyAmber> yep
[17:10:44] <robertmaxrees> comma
[17:10:51] <robertmaxrees> same way you'd select with css :)
[17:11:10] <TiffanyAmber> wouldn't that bed "OR" instead of "AND"?
[17:11:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:11:26] <robertmaxrees> you can't have two IDs on something heh
[17:11:26] <taplar_afk> yep
[17:11:42] <robertmaxrees> but that is correct, my bad.
[17:11:54] <TiffanyAmber> ;-(
[17:12:03] <robertmaxrees> do you have an element with multiple IDs?
[17:12:55] <TiffanyAmber> I'm fiddling with Bootstrap's collapse thingy and I want to watch and say "hey, when all is collapsed, when ALL elements are collapsed, then fire this action"
[17:13:10] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:13:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:13:17] <TiffanyAmber> $('#panelA').on('hidden.bs.collapse', function (event) {  <<< I want to add panel B to that too, so it checks there
[17:13:28] <robertmaxrees> so you want to check both elements?
[17:13:35] <robertmaxrees> like, do you want to bind a handler to both?
[17:14:10] <devi8> $("#panelA, #panelB")   or you could $("#panelA").add("#panelB") I think
[17:14:19] <robertmaxrees> slow down heh
[17:14:19] <TiffanyAmber> https://pastebin.com/5axig93Z
[17:14:26] <TiffanyAmber> That is the gist of it
[17:14:28] <TiffanyAmber> ;-C
[17:14:30] <robertmaxrees> we need to understqand the desired end result.
[17:14:39] <robertmaxrees> TiffanyAmber so back up.
[17:14:53] <robertmaxrees> do you want to listen to the close events on both of those elements?
[17:15:21] <TiffanyAmber> yeeeep!
[17:15:33] <robertmaxrees> and then you want to check if both elements are closed?
[17:15:37] <TiffanyAmber> that is what I was trying to explain, just that I couldn't put it into words haha
[17:15:44] <TiffanyAmber> exactly
[17:16:06] <robertmaxrees> so then you do want $('#idFOo, #idBar')
[17:16:22] <robertmaxrees> since you want to bind to any element that matches either of those IDs
[17:17:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1q2r9bjr/
[17:17:20] <robertmaxrees> same as in CSS.,
[17:18:47] <robertmaxrees> TiffanyAmber so now you want to check if both have a particular class, right?
[17:19:48] <TiffanyAmber> yes, (I just exploded my browser with a JS loop)
[17:19:52] <TiffanyAmber> (fixed it lol)
[17:19:57] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:20:14] <robertmaxrees> so how many of these elements can there be?
[17:20:16] <robertmaxrees> like, a few?
[17:20:27] <TiffanyAmber> 5 or 6, but I wanted to try with just these 2
[17:20:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so to make this easier, I'd toss a class on all of those elements that describes what they are.
[17:21:10] <robertmaxrees> and then you can just use https://api.jquery.com/hasclass/
[17:21:31] <robertmaxrees> that way you cna just do $('.allSections') instead of $('#foo, #bar, #baz, #qux') etc.
[17:22:51] <TiffanyAmber> my problem happens when I close just ONE, and then JQuery reads as if both have been closed, even when I use the comma. It seems that with just one of those two divs closed, it reads as if they were both closed and executes what's inside my function.
[17:25:06] <TiffanyAmber> Now I have $('.tota').on('hidden.bs.collapse', function (event) {   <<< and that class is on all the Panels that collapse/expand, but when one collapses, it reads as if all collapsed.
[17:25:13] <TiffanyAmber> so it executes ;-C
[17:25:28] <TiffanyAmber> I want just to execute if they have all collapsed
[17:32:40] <devi8> so inside your handler, just check if all of them are closed
[17:35:07] <devi8> ...function(event) { var itms=$("#foo, #bar"); var clsed=false; if (itms.filter(function () {return $(this).is(".closed")?null:$(this);}).length) {//not all are closed}}
[17:35:58] <devi8> ignore the var clsed=false, use filter and only return items that aren't closed. if any are returned, they must not all be closed
[17:36:50] <devi8> or better yet, just select them like this $("#foo.closed, #bar.closed").length==2   then both are closed
[17:38:00] <TiffanyAmber> $("#foo.closed, #bar.closed").length==2   <<< that .closed isn't just a class?
[17:38:43] <devi8> that says jquery find all closed #foo items and all closed #bar items. If the number you found is 2, both were closed.
[17:38:56] <devi8> yes it's a class
[17:39:13] <devi8> but the class is applied to the elements you are selecting.
[17:49:40] <guideX> once you abort an ajax request, it seems like you can't use it anymore eh?
[17:50:42] <taplar_> 'use it'?
[17:53:50] <guideX> idk, it doesn't seem to work after that
[17:53:54] <guideX> until I load the page again
[17:54:15] <guideX> I use an obj.abort(); but then how do you reset it again
[17:54:15] <taplar_> are you trying to start the request again?
[17:54:24] <guideX> start a new request yeah
[17:54:28] <taplar_> why not make a new one?
[17:54:45] <guideX> yes, how do I make a new one
[17:54:57] <taplar_> how did you make the first one?
[17:55:04] <guideX> I can do like, obj.abort() I'm hoping to make a obj.reset() or something
[17:55:22] <guideX> let me share some code, hold on
[17:56:08] <guideX> I'm doing something like this https://pastebin.com/raw/fPeiaYeu
[17:56:14] <guideX> I call the CancelGenericAjax()
[17:56:20] <taplar_> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26403264/jquery-ajax-abort-how-to-resend-again
[17:56:23] <guideX> but after that, how do you use GenericAjax again
[17:57:05] <guideX> so I've been to this page, but this isn't how I'm doing it, I'm using $ajax
[17:57:11] <guideX> err $.ajax
[17:57:50] <taplar_> then i would suggest you start another request with $.ajax
[17:57:50] <guideX> I'm actually not sure the page you linked, I think that's for drupa;l
[17:58:00] <guideX> yes I do, but it won't work until I reload the paghe
[17:58:06] <guideX> it doesn't send the request
[17:58:36] <taplar_> can you share that logic?
[17:59:06] <guideX> I mean, it's weird, it gets as far as the $ajaxRequest = $.ajax({ part and then nothing
[17:59:13] <guideX> after using .abort()
[17:59:27] <guideX> no fiddler items, no errors etc
[17:59:50] <taplar_> can you share the logic where you are creating the second request?
[18:00:05] <guideX> sure, one second..
[18:01:01] <guideX> the second request, I call GenericAjax with this https://pastebin.com/xLFFz7xL
[18:02:19] <taplar_> have you put any logging in there to verify that it is calling that method?
[18:02:39] <guideX> yeah it gets as far as the $.ajax then doesn't go any further, also it never sent out the request
[18:03:25] <taplar_> not sure then, because canceling a request should not prevent future requests.  they are independent
[18:03:36] <guideX> oh hmm
[18:10:56] <gambl0re> hello?
[18:11:04] <taplar_> evening
[18:11:16] <gambl0re> wheres robert?
[18:11:27] <taplar_> dunno, he's popped out a few times
[18:11:41] <gambl0re> tell him to pm me.
[19:13:58] <TiffanyAmber> okay I'm dying here
[19:14:06] <TiffanyAmber> can't make heads or tails of this
[19:15:19] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:17:20] <robertmaxrees> TiffanyAmber
[21:21:42] <devi8> to index and eq work the same...in other words var nextitem=itemslist.eq(currentItem.index()+1)  would that give me the next item?
[21:22:26] <devi8> sry do index...
[22:41:35] <TiffanyAmber> Heloooooo
[22:49:53] <TiffanyAmber> anyone here?
[22:50:21] <devi8> yes
[22:50:50] <TiffanyAmber> XD
[22:50:51] <TiffanyAmber> https://www.bootply.com/ZBAF1DZHmU
[22:51:04] <TiffanyAmber> I'm trying (attempting, really) to launch an event when BOTH those panels are collapsed (not just one, or the other)
[22:51:20] <TiffanyAmber> anyone has an idea of how can I go to do that?
[22:51:57] <devi8> We have told you a dozen times how to do it and you just aren't listening.
[22:54:52] <TiffanyAmber> I've tried, but for some reason it isn't working in bootstrap
[22:55:03] <TiffanyAmber> the ms get in the way of the states
[22:55:14] <devi8> how do you save changes to bootply
[22:55:19] <TiffanyAmber> because it has an animation
[22:55:41] <TiffanyAmber> fork
[22:56:53] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/wyzQgO
[22:57:40] <devi8> but you are going to need to attach that to an event...like say when one closes or when the user mouses out of a menu
[22:59:10] <TiffanyAmber> how about when someone clicks on one of the links that opens or closes?
[23:00:11] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/wyzQgO
[23:00:19] <devi8> sure. but how are they animating? css?
[23:01:23] <devi8> because if you use the click event, you have to know how long the animation runs after the click before you can check if its hidden
[23:05:12] <TiffanyAmber> thankx for your help
[23:05:24] <TiffanyAmber> they are animating through css, so that's the problem
[23:05:30] <devi8> no problem
[23:05:40] <devi8> do you know what the duration is?
[23:06:36] <devi8> $("elem").on("click", function (e) { var t=setTimeout(function ( ){ checkClosed}, duration+10)});
[23:06:48] <TiffanyAmber> yep, I'm using $(this).delay(500).queue(function(){
[23:07:22] <TiffanyAmber> but when both close, for some freaking reason, it won't finish the delay.
[23:07:35] <devi8> what is $(this)
[23:08:00] <devi8> and when you queue something you have to dequeue it, I think
[23:12:36] <TiffanyAmber> mmmm clearqueue
[23:53:16] <TiffanyAmber> ;-D
[23:53:16] <TiffanyAmber> just came here to say thanks
