[18:31:54] <ekiro> i have a list displayed with a border-top and the first item does not have a border. when i delete the first item (hide()) the one below it, on top on, has the border. how would I get it to not have the border for the top item?
[20:23:00] <beshoo> i am using jquery in cordova app. , when i am doing POST/GET from mobile app. to the website i have the usual error access-control-allow-origin - but in my website i did allow access-control-allow-origin and in the cordova app. i add  <access origin="*" /> in the conf
[20:23:05] <beshoo> how can i solve that
[20:24:18] <beshoo> dataType: 'JSONp',
[21:39:34] <ekiro> I have a UI where the user can generate bunch of rows and also delete them. I want the first (top) row to have no border on top. When the user deletes the top row, the row below it takes the top spot. How can remove the border-top css of the top row when user deletes rows?
[21:39:49] <ekiro> I seem to have issues applying it to dynamic rows that are generated/deleted.
[21:44:10] <ekiro> nvm i got it
[21:44:27] <ekiro> needed to use .remove() isntead of .hide*()
[23:44:31] <ekiro> how do you hide something instantly? i noticed hide is a little slow
[23:48:29] <pavonia> You can call .hide() with a number indicating the number of ms the animation should last
