[00:16:24] <zafu> hi, using ui's tooltip widget how can I make sure that only ONE tooltip is ever opened at a time?
[00:16:59] <zafu> my elements are close together and when moving the mouse sometimes several tooltips stay open
[00:19:37] <jphase> zafu: are you using dynamic content in your tooltip by chance?
[00:19:43] <zafu> yes
[00:21:17] <jphase> there's been some issues reported but they appear resolved by jquery contributors with jsfiddles
[00:21:19] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/BukmE/
[00:21:29] <jphase> original ticket: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8740
[00:21:57] <jphase> woops
[00:22:00] <jphase> wrong fiddle, here: http://jsfiddle.net/hkuFE/2/
[00:22:07] <zafu> ah, thanks :)
[00:22:27] <jphase> np
[00:22:48] <zafu> right on spot
[00:31:41] <skpp> jQuery UI, how do I init the datepicker with the value from the input field? the value has the XML dateTime format
[00:33:37] <jphase> skpp: you have to build a Date object and convert the date from the value in your input
[00:34:59] <skpp> and put that into the options of .datepicker({...})? what's the options key there?
[00:35:15] <jphase> $('.datepicker').datepicker('setDate', new Date());
[00:36:34] <skpp> aaah. thanks. should have consulted the api, not the examples
[00:36:48] <jphase> np
[01:01:17] <skpp> jphase: I can't get it to work. look: https://dpaste.de/zIQFW/  the Date object is correct yet the picker isn't set to anything
[01:12:24] <zmode> hi. i have jquery-ui.js in my page and then i also source a custom datepicker.js. is the fact that the custom datepicker overrides the one from jquery-ui a feature of jquery, javascript, or neither and i just got lucky that it happens to be working at the moment?
[01:13:32] <jphase> zmode: if the custom datepicker isn't interacting with jQuery UI specifically then it's possible that it's unbinding events on the element before it's called
[01:14:07] <jphase> often times things that modify inputs like that will unbind everything first so it will override jQuery UI if it's called after the .datepicker() call of jQuery ui
[01:15:03] <zmode> jphase: so you're saying that /both/ datepickers could be getting called? the "custom" on is a verbatim copy of the original with some conditions patched in
[01:15:47] <jphase> possibly
[01:15:55] <jphase> hard to tell without inspecting
[01:16:09] <jphase> I assume only the custom one shows up when you focus on the element?
[01:17:03] <zmode> jphase: yeah. the change is that i only want it to pop up on left-click and that happens as expected
[01:17:25] <zmode> it would probably be wiser to get this done right in one file for production
[01:17:28] <jphase> zmode: yeah, I'd just remove your jquery ui datepicker call
[01:17:43] <jphase> pick one or the other
[01:18:35] <M3kH> Good Morning!

[01:36:39] <HenryCH> Hi guys, I have a php file echoing a <a href=.. class='joinlink'>, and then I use jquery to do some processing when the link gets clicked, rather than going to the href. This php echo is in a loop which echoes several of these links so I used class instead of id. Then in my javascript file I do: $('.joinlink').click(function(e) { ....      The problem is that only seems to work for the first link in the several that get echoed, what
[01:37:27] <HenryCH> So I have a e.preventDefault(); inside that function,   when I click the first link I don't get taken to the href and the function executes fine, in all other links I do get taken to the href
[01:38:31] <HenryCH> I don't think I can use an id because the id would have to be generated in the echo, and then I wouldn't be able to target it with jquery, right?
[01:39:17] <rabbi1> Hi, I got 4 mutiple select elements each having some n number of options… how can i get all selected options and save in an array list ?
[01:39:51] <HenryCH> Oh, actually, it seems like any of the links upon first click give the expected behaviour, but if I click the same link again I get taken to the href
[01:53:51] <rabbi1> Hi, I got 4 mutiple select elements each having some n number of options… how can i get all selected options and save in an array list ? any help
[02:23:51] <Aquaword> hi
[02:26:14] <Aquaword> I use a jquery plugin on a specific screen size, how to switch off, disable the plugin on a different screen size? I use modernizr currently for checking
[02:26:16] <Aquaword> Example: http://hastebin.com/hayexesaja.vhdl
[02:31:24] <dismist> there's a css media call for screen-width
[02:43:31] <SuperTyp> hello everybody I want to use the superscrollorama plugin
[02:44:11] <SuperTyp> I didn't work a long time with jquery so I need some start help
[02:45:08] <doug65536> Aquaword: read the documentation for the plugin to see how to turn it off
[02:45:25] <Aquaword> doug65536, no such option
[02:46:47] <SuperTyp> did someone work with the superscrollorama plugin?
[02:49:34] <SuperTyp> first question what is a "tween"?
[02:51:47] <doug65536> SuperTyp: tween usually refers to keyframes - you specify some properties at a some number of time points and it blends in be-"tween"
[02:52:08] <doug65536> "tweening" is determining the properties at the in between points
[02:53:22] <doug65536> SuperTyp: the mathematical term is "interpolation"
[02:53:27] <SuperTyp> ah ok
[02:54:44] <SuperTyp> second question if I want to activate horizontal scrolling, do I have to change the superscrollorama function itselfs or do I have to set it in my html file?
[02:55:00] <SuperTyp> in a script tag e.g.
[02:57:30] <doug65536> SuperTyp: I looked at the docs - seems like scripting only. I don't see any mention of markup
[02:57:38] <SuperTyp> ok
[02:57:42] <SuperTyp> got it already :>
[02:57:51] <SuperTyp> doesn't work though :D
[02:58:16] <SuperTyp> I acutally want it as it is in their website
[02:58:31] <SuperTyp> when I scroll down I want "the next page" to be moved in from the right
[02:59:02] <doug65536> SuperTyp: I would make the "next page" be a div, and tween it from left: 100% to left: 0%
[02:59:54] <doug65536> it will slide in from the right if you do that
[02:59:56] <SuperTyp> left to right?
[03:00:04] <SuperTyp> or really left to left?
[03:00:09] <doug65536> what?
[03:00:45] <doug65536> if left is 100% then it is completely off the right side of the screen
[03:00:51] <SuperTyp> ok
[03:01:05] <doug65536> if left is -100% then it is completely off the left side of the screen
[03:01:28] <doug65536> assuming its parent is either the body or something that is already the full width of the body
[03:01:36] <doug65536> and its parent is positioned
[03:14:49] <SuperTyp> doug65536: do you maybe know if there is a plugin that does the slide effect not in scroll but onclick?
[03:15:14] <SuperTyp> to make the "Enter" button on a start.html more smooth
[03:15:27] <SuperTyp> I want the next page to be slided in from the right
[03:16:52] <doug65536> SuperTyp: yes there are probably over 100 slider plugins. google jquery slider
[03:16:59] <SuperTyp> ok
[03:17:42] <doug65536> SuperTyp: here's 111 of them: http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/slider/
[03:18:59] <SuperTyp> thx
[03:21:50] <SuperTyp> but they are not exactly what I am looking for
[03:22:46] <SuperTyp> I want if you click on the "enter" link at the bottom of the page, that the next page will be slided in from the right, I don't want it like a diashow or gallery
[03:23:25] <Thoams> nothing's likely to be exactly what you're looking for
[03:23:31] <Thoams> so... adapt the best looking candidate
[03:23:36] <Thoams> or write your own from scratch
[03:23:49] <SuperTyp> I think I found one that is pretty good
[03:46:49] <krafty> how can i do conditional validation of a textbox based on the class of the textbox, or a checkbox on the same row?
[03:46:59] <krafty> (whichever is easier)
[03:48:10] <dev11> how to make function that will execute immeadetly when defied ?
[03:49:00] <Cork> dev11: (function() {})()
[03:49:14] <Cork> krafty: are you talking about with jquery.validator?
[03:49:31] <dev11> Cork,  thanks
[03:52:19] <jbraun^particula> https://github.com/minddust/jquery-pjaxr  For those who want their site to be efficient ,)
[04:01:50] <SuperTyp> can someone explain me how to add parameters to a function of the jQuery UI?
[04:01:56] <SuperTyp> e.g. the slide effect
[04:02:15] <Cork> parameters?
[04:02:54] <SuperTyp> yes like direction
[04:03:31] <SuperTyp> here
[04:03:31] <SuperTyp> http://jqueryui.com/toggle/
[04:04:13] <Cork> SuperPhly: not sure what it is your asking about
[04:07:09] <SuperTyp> Cork: I want to know how to write the options right into the function
[04:07:27] <dwarder> how do i understand the difference between .closest and .parents ?
[04:07:44] <Cork> dwarder: closest finds you the closest element matching the selector
[04:07:54] <krambiorix> hi, can i combine multiple selectors in one?
[04:07:55] <Cork> parents gives you an array of all parent elements matching the selector
[04:08:05] <Cork> krambiorix: yes, just use comma
[04:08:06] <SuperTyp> do I only have to type them in, in the right order?
[04:08:09] <SuperTyp> ok thx
[04:08:29] <dwarder> Cork: i see, tnx
[04:14:53] <dev111> how can I send get variables in the url with jquery?
[04:14:55] <dev111> with ajax
[04:14:58] <dev111> to a php file
[04:15:16] <Cork> ?api jquery.get
[04:15:16] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.get(): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[04:15:34] <dev111> no
[04:15:42] <dev111> I  need to send data not get Cork
[04:15:51] <Cork> dev111: that is the same thing
[04:15:52] <T13|needsCoffee> Ohh. There is a bot here for that?
[04:16:12] <T13|needsCoffee> ?api .is()
[04:16:12] <b-ot> T13|needsCoffee: No matches.
[04:16:28] <T13|needsCoffee> ?api jquery.is()
[04:16:28] <b-ot> T13|needsCoffee: No matches.
[04:16:31] <Cork> dev111: if you want load the params from the query in the url you want window.location.search
[04:16:32] <T13|needsCoffee> Boo
[04:16:36] <Cork> ?api is
[04:16:36] <b-ot> Cork: .is(): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return <code>true</code> if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[04:16:52] <T13|needsCoffee> Ahh. Omit punctuation.
[04:17:26] <dev111> I don't understand
[04:17:46] <dev111> Cork, can you please short code here to send url  get parametere to file aa.php?
[04:18:07] <Cork> ?api get
[04:18:07] <b-ot> Cork: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/

[04:18:16] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.get(): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[04:18:20] <Cork> dev111: read that one
[04:23:04] <dev111> Cork,  I am atotally confused
[04:23:27] <Cork> dev111: $.get is for the http get verb and $.post is for the post verb
[04:23:38] <Cork> so if you want the params in the url, it is the get verb
[04:23:44] <Cork> what's confusing about that?
[04:27:54] <krambiorix> Cork, a bit late , but thanks!
[04:28:19] <Cork> krambiorix: yw
[04:30:51] <SuperTyp> Cork: when I write it like this: http://pastebin.com/bPL27Fu4
[04:31:10] <SuperTyp> both divs are stille sliding to the same side...
[04:32:49] <Cork> SuperPhly: { direction: "right/left" }
[04:34:50] <SuperTyp> Cork: after the comma?
[04:34:54] <Cork> yes
[04:35:05] <SuperTyp> with { } ?
[04:35:11] <SuperTyp> because I already tried that...
[04:36:00] <SuperTyp> Cork:
[04:36:00] <SuperTyp> got it
[04:36:09] <SuperTyp> it was the missing {}
[04:36:33] <Cork> it wouldn't parse without it
[04:37:01] <SuperTyp> thx
[04:47:09] <SuperTyp> thank you very much guys
[05:03:54] <doug65536> is h missing for any of you: 𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑔𝑕𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑙𝑚𝑛𝑜𝑝𝑞𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑣𝑤𝑥𝑦𝑧
[05:04:24] <Cork> "h" ?
[05:04:50] <doug65536> if you don't see the alphabet they are non BMP unicode characters
[05:05:13] <lsfc1914> Hello. I have several elements with one and the same class. I want when clicking on one of them to show (slideToggle()) only its children elements. Can you give me some tips how to do this?
[05:05:18] <Cork> well i see some quite hard to read characters
[05:05:41] <tacajushi> hello there I need a help, take a look https://gist.github.com/dolohow/bcf477127a0e17d24a57 all I want to do is change values of cells with regex
[05:05:58] <Cork> lsfc1914: $(this).find('.class').slideToggle()
[05:06:23] <Cork> tacajushi: you need to give it regex, not strings
[05:06:50] <tacajushi> Cork: have you looked at the code?
[05:07:14] <Cork> js> print('12.1255'.replace(/([0-9]{2}\.){2}[0-9]{2}/, ''))
[05:07:21] <b-ot> Cork: 12.1255
[05:07:33] <doug65536> tacajushi: you need to read the text, do the replacement on the string, and set the text
[05:07:50] <doug65536> tacajushi: so there are two problems with that code
[05:07:52] <tacajushi> how can I extract text from such jquery object?
[05:08:00] <Cork> and ya, you need to store the modified content too
[05:08:20] <Cork> tacajushi: you are doing it fine, but you need to write it back to the dom again
[05:08:25] <Cork> (and fix he regex)
[05:08:28] <Cork> *the
[05:08:55] <Cork> $(this).text($(this).text().replace())
[05:09:05] <doug65536> $('.gridDane').children().each(function(){$(this).text($(this).text().replace(/([0-9]{2}\.){2}[0-9]{2}/, ''))})
[05:09:38] <doug65536> tacajushi: the "inner" .text() reads it, the outer one sets it with the replacement.
[05:10:09] <doug65536> tacajushi: and I changed your regex from a string literal to a regex literal
[05:10:17] <tacajushi> working
[05:10:18] <tacajushi> thanks
[05:10:40] <tacajushi> $('.gridDane').children().each(function(){$(this).text($(this).text().replace(/([0-9]{2}\.){2}[0-9]{2}/, ''))});
[05:10:44] <tacajushi> working :)
[05:13:29] <lsfc1914> Cork, and what should be the selector for the click event, just $('.class')?
[05:14:21] <Cork> lsfc1914: what do you mean?
[05:16:05] <lsfc1914> $(.class).click(function() { ...and than your answer to my question
[05:16:13] <lsfc1914> then*
[05:16:17] <Cork> no
[05:16:37] <MikeNoob> Hi everyone
[05:16:38] <Cork> you asked how to target elements that is children to the target element
[05:17:32] <MikeNoob> Im trying to get things working, and it doesnt the way I expect, (remember im a noob) ....
[05:18:03] <MikeNoob> i load an external functions.js in my header, but then my ID from my elements are not working
[05:18:25] <Cork> MikeNoob: make sure you wait for ready
[05:18:29] <MikeNoob> Ik I load the external script at the end of my document (all elements are loaded) then it works perfectly
[05:19:19] <MikeNoob> Sorry, Cork, u mean wait for ready from you till its my turn to talk here, or wait for document.ready() ? ;)
[05:19:48] <Cork> $(function() {}) or $(document).ready(function() {}) yes
[05:20:18] <MikeNoob> I have a function ready() where i tested with alert (Doc is ready);
[05:20:23] <MikeNoob> that works perfectly
[05:20:37] <Cork> and where you try to access the id is inside that function?
[05:21:07] <MikeNoob> in the same file I have a $("myID").click(function(){ ...};  which does not work at all
[05:21:19] <Cork> in the same function as you did the alert?
[05:21:43] <MikeNoob> No, just after that on a new "paragraph" to keep things a bit clean)
[05:22:23] <MikeNoob> If I load the same script, after all my elements are loaded, it works like a charm
[05:22:38] <Cork> MikeNoob: well there you go
[05:22:40] <MikeNoob> So i was already thinking it had to be something with that
[05:22:43] <Cork> you need to wait for the ready callback
[05:22:50] <Cork> that means you need to run inside the callback
[05:23:01] <MikeNoob> But should all my additional functions be in the ready funtion???)
[05:23:18] <Cork> the declarations don't have to be in there no
[05:23:23] <Cork> but the calls to them has to
[05:23:43] <MikeNoob> Mmm that i dont get ... can you please explain a bit more?
[05:23:46] <Cork> else they will run on js parsing instead of at dom ready
[05:24:00] <Cork> when the page is loaded
[05:24:11] <Cork> the browser starts by loading the sections in the head
[05:24:25] <Cork> when it finds script tags it makes a network calls and fetches the file
[05:24:31] <Cork> and then hands the script to the parser
[05:24:41] <Cork> while this happens the parsing of the page is stopped
[05:25:00] <Cork> when the parser runs through the script, if it isn't in a ready callback THAT is when they will run
[05:25:00] <MikeNoob> ok, so far I think i get you
[05:25:22] <Cork> when the script engine is done and the parser starts up again
[05:25:25] <Cork> it gets to body
[05:25:34] <Cork> and when the parser gets down to the end of the body
[05:25:39] <Cork> it fires DOMContentLoaded
[05:25:46] <Cork> (this is what fires .ready)
[05:26:02] <Cork> so until that time the id you look for won't exist in the dom, so you can't select it
[05:26:12] <MikeNoob> sounds logical
[05:26:55] <MikeNoob> but, if i declare the function in the script, ie $(myid).click()   it wont be fired until i click myid, correct?
[05:27:22] <MikeNoob> so, is it completely ignored then, since during loading the element was not yet available, therefore no script attached to it?
[05:27:29] <Cork> the callback won't, but it can only fire if it has actually been attached to an element
[05:27:40] <Cork> $('myid') actually looks for the element in the dom
[05:27:50] <Cork> and if the element isn't found, the line is a noop
[05:28:06] <MikeNoob> Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I can see the light now!  (or at least i think!!!)
[05:28:50] <MikeNoob> So the functions declared in the sript will not remain "in memory" untill the element is actually there
[05:29:02] <Cork> no they actually run
[05:29:04] <eimajenthat> I've got a page using jQuery Mobile, with two buttons that call different functions using inline onClick attributes.  When I hit Enter, it triggers one of my buttons.  How is it choosing that button, and how do I make it stop?
[05:29:19] <MikeNoob> and if there is no el to attach to, they are ignored
[05:29:28] <Cork> MikeNoob: $(myid).click() is actually two calls
[05:29:38] <Cork> MikeNoob: first you have $(myid)
[05:29:53] <Cork> MikeNoob: this one looks in the dom for elements matching the selector
[05:30:09] <Cork> MikeNoob: and build an array like list of the elements it found
[05:30:35] <Cork> MikeNoob: this list has all the jquery function on it, so you run .click from that list of functions
[05:30:50] <MikeNoob> I see......
[05:31:05] <Cork> MikeNoob: the click function then loops over the elements, and runs the addEventListener call to each element
[05:31:25] <Cork> so if it isn't in the list, it gets nothing
[05:31:39] <MikeNoob> I get it! Thanks a million!
[05:31:45] <Cork> np
[05:32:07] <MikeNoob> So, to keep things nice and clean, best to run a load-external script in the $DOC.ready() function ?
[05:32:22] <Cork> MikeNoob: no
[05:32:30] <MikeNoob> hahahaha
[05:32:35] <MikeNoob> cool, i htought i got it :(
[05:32:35] <Cork> just add $(function() {}) wrapper around the content in the script file
[05:32:57] <MikeNoob> and thats it?
[05:33:05] <Cork> MikeNoob: you would have to load the script through ajax and eval it if you should do it in doc ready
[05:33:10] <Cork> MikeNoob: yes
[05:33:49] <MikeNoob> OK, will try that then! I was just trying to figure out how to keep things together in the right scripts so I would not have 1 huge JS with everything in it
[05:33:51] <Cork> MikeNoob: $(function() {}); is a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {});
[05:33:59] <MikeNoob> Cool
[05:34:28] <Cork> MikeNoob: you should normally scope your scripts anyway, so it solves it fairly well anyway
[05:34:51] <Cork> that way you don't pollute the global scope
[05:35:24] <MikeNoob> Yep, So I wont need to do a lot of hassle, just add the $(function()) tags around every script I create ?
[05:35:41] <MikeNoob> (per script of course, not poer function ;) )
[05:36:19] <Cork> MikeNoob: well generally yes that will work
[05:36:45] <Cork> MikeNoob: there are situations you want scripts to run as soon as possible, and then you might not want to have them in the wrapper
[05:36:57] <Cork> but that is a fairly safe way to start
[05:37:08] <MikeNoob> Ah, that is currently not the case (run before page ready)
[05:37:14] <Cork> and when you get the hang of how things work you can start moving things out
[05:38:09] <MikeNoob> Indeed, I currently include 1 script in all pages (with global scripts) and then per page I sometimes load extra scripts to enhance existing or add new functions)
[05:38:38] <MikeNoob> Whereas other pages dont need any extra script at all...
[05:38:52] <krambiorix> does anyone know Dropzone.js and how to add a Complete event?
[05:39:19] <MikeNoob> thanks again Cork! Much appreciated!

[05:51:14] <Colmea> Hello
[05:53:54] <Colmea> I have an little question: I have a notification  plugin, and click on this notification can be handled (to close it, for example). But I want to close notification only if user click on a button
[05:55:22] <Colmea> so my question is: how can I retrieve the dom element wich is clicked from an event object ?
[05:55:49] <Cork> Colmea: well if the click handler is pointing on the element is question
[05:55:51] <Cork> just $(this)
[05:56:12] <Cork> if you want to filter out bubbling event events use event.target
[05:56:24] <Cork> *bubbling events
[05:56:48] <Colmea> Cork: the button is not the element wich trigger event
[05:57:12] <Cork> Colmea: what element is the listener bound on?
[05:57:48] <Colmea> a parent div
[05:57:58] <Colmea> (a button's parent div)
[05:58:03] <Cork> and you binding the event listener?
[05:58:35] <Colmea> yes. Actually it's an option from notification plugin
[05:59:03] <Colmea> http://www.erichynds.com/blog/a-jquery-ui-growl-ubuntu-notification-widget
[05:59:04] <Cork> $(parentDiv).on('click', 'button', function() {})
[05:59:10] <Cork> is the cleanest way to do it then
[06:00:29] <Colmea> didn't know there is an target param on click event
[06:00:44] <Cork> it's for delegated event listeners
[06:00:45] <Colmea> thanks
[06:13:54] <G1eb> does anyone know, is there a delegated channel for reveal js kinds of questions?
[06:14:59] <jbraun^particula> don't think so G1eb
[06:22:00] <G1eb> jbraun^particula: thanks, have you ever used it ?
[06:22:31] <G1eb> jbraun^particula: I'm not sure I'm trying something nobody has tried before
[06:31:24] <Dudi> I want find all div with class "accepted" in div with id "users" so my jq should look like this  var $acceptedUsers = $("#users").find(".accepted");  right?
[06:33:29] <notsnappysam> right
[06:54:18] <[cg]> anyone got two minutes to give a pointer or two to a frustrated person? it involves debugging someone else's javascript+jquery...

[06:56:08] <diverdude> weee
[06:56:09] <diverdude> :D
[06:56:29] <[cg]> alrighty then... all I want to do is find the functions(s) that fire on .click ...
[06:56:37] <[cg]> all the listeners are somewhere
[06:57:13] <Cork> [cg]: $._data()
[06:57:16] <[cg]> i can set a click breakpoint but I just end up stepping through minified jquery
[06:57:48] <[cg]> and never get to step through the listening functions
[06:57:53] <[cg]> does that make any sense?
[06:59:45] <Cork> [cg]: $.map($('*'), function(elm) { return $._data(elm, 'events'); }) will give you a list of all the event listeners jquery knows about
[07:02:08] <[cg]> $.map($('*'), function(elm) { return $._data(elm, 'events'); }) gives me everything (which is quite a bit)
[07:02:17] <[cg]> $.map($('#mytarget'), function(elm) { return $._data(elm, 'events'); })
[07:02:44] <[cg]> gives me nothing...
[07:02:47] <dwarder> why doens't it show anything ? http://jsfiddle.net/kmq6C/
[07:02:48] <Cork> there you could just do $._data($('#mytarget')[0], 'events')
[07:02:54] <Cork> as the id will only match one element
[07:03:08] <dwarder> i don't see console log output in my console
[07:03:17] <Cork> [cg]: if you want all elements inside the id, you need another selector
[07:03:56] <Cork> dwarder: cause you have a reference error so the parser stops
[07:04:15] <Cork> (i is undefined)
[07:04:48] <dwarder> Cork: ohh, my bad
[07:05:41] <[cg]> $._data('#menu-e8ffa9c7-dae7-438e-8ace-415c23bc3207','events'); returns undefined
[07:05:54] <[cg]> but I can click on the element with that id and something fires.
[07:06:07] <[cg]> sry
[07:06:23] <Cork> data doens't take a selector
[07:06:25] <Cork> it takes an element
[07:06:31] <[cg]> doing it wrong
[07:06:32] <[cg]> $._data($('#menu-e8ffa9c7-dae7-438e-8ace-415c23bc3207')[0],'events');
[07:06:36] <[cg]> you're my heros!
[07:13:50] <[cg]> wel..... it got me in the ballpark: ig gave me some text to search the code for...
[07:17:01] <unr3al011> join #css
[07:23:17] <[cg]> just want to say thx. i really appreciate the point in the right direction.
[07:41:27] <usc911> Hey guys, I have fancybox 2 open and if I click a button I created in the corner it closes and launched a div (alert). This all works fine, I just want to know if it is possible to launch the same div if I just click on the overlay to close fancybox? cheers
[07:48:02] <BillCriswell> usc911: So you don't want the fancybox to be closeable by clicking the outside area?
[07:49:00] <usc911> BillCriswell: I do want tit to be cloasebale by clicking out, but I want the div to load when I click out of the fancybox
[07:50:18] <sunbeam> mouseleave
[07:50:20] <kwikness> hey guys. trying to use draggable/resizable with containment set. when i try to resize the inner square, it immediately shrinks to half its width and i can't figure out why. don't bother trying jsfiddle because it works correctly there but not in firefox or chrome: http://pastebin.com/ZJut6UzQ
[07:50:27] <sunbeam> can this be used to see if not 2 elements are hovered?
[07:50:38] <sunbeam> I mean,  i want to make sure mouse is left from 2 elements
[07:52:59] <sunbeam> i want to real time check if the mouse is not hovered over 2 elements
[07:54:57] <Anticom2> Hi all
[07:56:01] <Anticom2> i'm looking for a plugin that manages grids with effects and stuff. But i don't mean tables displaying data but a griddy kind of thing like in google+. unfortunately i can't find anything at google
[07:57:55] <BillCriswell> usc911: So open #div-1 in fancybox, if #div-1 closes open #div-2?
[07:59:35] <Anticom2> I saw one like that before but even more awesome: http://gridster.net/
[07:59:36] <usc911> BillCriswell: yeah click button > launch fancybox. Click outside of fancybox to close launch other div. I have the other div launching if I click a button within fancybox to cloase it
[07:59:43] <Anticom2> any suggestions?
[08:02:03] <BillCriswell> usc911: It looks like there's an afterClose method that you can do $('#button-that-launches-second-fancybox').trigger('click') in. You could also just do like $.fancybox( $('#second-fancybox')) in the afterClose
[08:02:15] <BillCriswell> http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#docs and click "callbacks"
[08:02:47] <usc911> cool man, I just camre acoss that
[08:02:51] <usc911> came across*
[08:03:49] <jedimind> dont use any library that asks you to include 9 goddamn assets in the header
[08:03:51] <jedimind> NINE
[08:04:00] <jedimind> even if 5 are optional
[08:10:14] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Haha, I love fancybox. Haven't used it much recently but it's been good to me.
[08:11:07] <BillCriswell> You just need 1 JS and 1 CSS file for it, everything else is optional.
[08:11:07] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Clients eat that shit up.
[08:12:19] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/IbeGIlO/2/edit hacked this up last night, went a lot smoother than i imagined. Trying to clean it up now.
[08:13:45] <boytoy> BillCriswell: lookin' gooooooooood =)
[08:13:59] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I've seen it done before but not responsively.
[08:14:17] <BillCriswell> Going to use http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/ and a few choice albums and see how it goes.
[08:16:00] <boytoy> good god
[08:16:10] <boytoy> i gotta clone that for my secret stash
[08:16:35] <BillCriswell> boytoy: Yeah, it's fun.
[08:17:05] <BillCriswell> Also want to maybe use it on a product list. If you have some colorful products and good product images I think it could make something really fun.
[08:17:44] <boytoy> oh yeah
[08:17:47] <boytoy> anything to make more sales :P
[08:18:50] <BillCriswell> Indeed! Hopefully it would make it more engaging... but you never know until you look at the numbers.
[08:19:58] <boytoy> yup
[08:28:48] <Anticom2> btw found it: http://jquery-plugins.net/shuffle-sort-and-filter-a-responsive-grid-of-items
[08:28:52] <Anticom2> awesome plugin
[08:30:38] <BillCriswell> Anticom2: Masonry is another one.
[08:31:05] <jedimind> actually this "shuffle" is the other one
[08:31:08] <jedimind> masonry is the first one
[08:31:08] <jedimind> :)
[08:31:16] <jphase> masonry is dope
[08:31:27] <BillCriswell> jedimind: True.
[08:31:57] <Anticom2> BillCriswell is that one limited to a constant box-width / -height ?
[08:32:47] <BillCriswell> Anticom2: Don't think so.
[08:33:07] <Anticom2> BillCriswell gonna stick with shuffle for now i guess
[08:33:20] <BillCriswell> Anticom2: I don't blame you, seems similar enough.
[08:35:46] <jedimind> i blame you.
[08:36:04] <jphase> lul
[08:48:48] <dybowski> test
[08:49:37] <duch_kazatel> testies
[08:52:42] <dybowski> I'm getting the "Error: spawn ENOENT" when running 'grunt deploy' (step 8 of  http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/#workflow).  I have `xmllint` and `xsltproc`  in my system path (Windows machine).  Can someone point me to a solution that does not involve installing linux :)  All of  the steps up ot 8 have worked and wordpress is installed and running.
[08:55:10] <jphase> hehe, I see why people suggest linux, they're probably wanting you to use rsync instead
[08:55:13] <BillCriswell> dybowski: Think you might be in the wrong channel.
[08:56:35] <s5fs> dybowski: try #jquery-content, someone may be able to help you in there
[08:56:36] <jphase> dybowski: confirm you have java installed and working
[08:56:38] <dybowski> BillCriswell: thanks - I was close
[08:57:04] <BillCriswell> Didn't notice the jquery url haha.
[09:02:24] <webguy024> can I ask a question about mockjax here?
[09:02:54] <grafi> you can ask a question about anything
[09:03:06] <grafi> just dont count on getting an answer :P
[09:04:44] <webguy024> sweet, when using mockjax how do I setup the return data when calling an api url like /foo/1/bar/1 ? I see I can setup urlParams but how do I setup the return data?
[09:08:13] <grafi> isnt the return data in the responseText?
[09:08:27] <grafi> responseText: {
[09:08:28] <grafi>     status: 'success',
[09:08:28] <grafi>     fortune: 'Are you a turtle?'
[09:08:28] <grafi>   }
[09:12:24] <patchy> is there an easy way to get the path for a jquery selector, right from a debugger in firefox or chrome?
[09:13:17] <xec_> patchy: "path"? in what sense?
[09:13:34] <jphase> patchy: there used to be .selector but that's deprecated now (if I understand you correctly)
[09:14:11] <patchy> hmm..the path for a element
[09:14:39] <patchy> like in chrome i can easily get the xpath for an element...but i have no converter to jquery selector
[09:15:13] <jphase> you mean like how when you inspect the element and Chrome gives you something like "body > header > div#mydiv" type thing?
[09:16:18] <patchy> yeah
[09:16:32] <jphase> not anymore
[09:16:40] <jphase> .selector used to but it's now deprecated
[09:16:51] <patchy> ahh..why? :(
[09:16:52] <jphase> and there is no replacement
[09:16:57] <patchy> what about a converter from other types?
[09:16:59] <lindseyr> you could write your own function to recursively traverse the parentNodes, reverse the array, and join it on >
[09:17:14] <jphase> well there's really not a good reason to reverse-engineer the selector tbh
[09:17:39] <jphase> but yeah lindseyr (Velveeta you so sneaky!) is correct, that'd be the only approach
[09:17:47] <lindseyr> damnit, it renamed me again?
[09:18:54] <Velveeta> phew, good thing i don't have my porn nickname as the default on connection, or you'd totally be talking to SchlongDongWillieWingWong
[09:19:13] <xec_> lol
[09:19:21] <BillCriswell> Sounds Asian.
[09:19:30] <Velveeta> i'm caucAsian, it counts
[09:19:41] <patchy> is there an alternative for me to use something else then jquery for this then? or is jquery the best? ..i wanna make greasemonkey scripts
[09:20:23] <xec_> patchy: what exactly are you trying to do?
[09:20:25] <Velveeta> patchy: there may be some readymade plugin for it out there somewhere, but i'm not sure of any off the top of my head
[09:21:04] <patchy> xec_: make greasemonkey scripts without having to make the dom :P since i have to make 50 of them or so :P hehe
[09:21:27] <patchy> Velveeta: ok =/...no converters from xpath either?
[09:23:14] <jphase> patchy: if you want a add-on, here's one for ff: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firepath/
[09:23:23] <jphase> an add-on*
[09:23:43] <patchy> thanks alot..i will check that out :D
[09:23:54] <grafi> still not sure why greasemonkey scripts would cause you to reverse engineer the dom oô
[09:24:16] <patchy> grafi: what would you recommend?
[09:24:34] <grafi> nothing, i dont even understand your problem ^^
[09:24:48] <patchy> grafi: greasemonkey is to make scripts change already made code...so it would always be reverse engineering dom :P
[09:25:29] <grafi> i know what greasemonkey does, i have some scripts written myself
[09:25:39] <grafi> i just never needed xpath oô or anything like that
[09:26:03] <patchy> grafi: if i want to change the width of a searchbox, then i would have to have the dom for that searchbox..what if thats like 25 elements before that searchbox?...
[09:26:33] <patchy> i want to program, not do the dirtywork if i can get that automaticly
[09:26:47] <grafi> to change the width of a searchbox (in jquery) just select the searchbox and set the width
[09:27:11] <grafi> its probably also very easy to do in "normal" javascript
[09:27:17] <jphase> yeah, I tend to agree with grafi and jQuery's developers when they got rid of .selector, there's not much of a reason for it tbh.
[09:27:39] <patchy> how do i just select that searchbox?
[09:27:43] <grafi> xpath is kind of yucky anyway
[09:27:57] <patchy> the ID attribute is changing each time i refresh the site..hehe
[09:27:59] <grafi> well assuming it has a class or better yet an id
[09:28:05] <grafi> its really easy
[09:28:07] <grafi> ok
[09:28:08] <grafi> oô
[09:28:09] <grafi> why
[09:28:10] <grafi> ..
[09:28:11] <patchy> no, its no class
[09:28:13] <grafi> any pattern?
[09:28:14] <patchy> i dont know
[09:28:19] <patchy> nope..random..:S
[09:28:20] <grafi> whats the site?
[09:28:26] <patchy> its an internal website
[09:28:29] <jphase> if it changes all the time, then you could use the structure itself parent/child relationship to select it
[09:28:30] <grafi> hm
[09:28:32] <patchy> for a ticketsystem at my job
[09:28:38] <jphase> use > in your selectors
[09:28:40] <grafi> what jphase said
[09:28:52] <grafi> it should still be relatively easy to do
[09:29:06] <patchy> yeah...and that would be the whole path...right?...like i said?
[09:29:07] <grafi> but of course its annoying, why would ids change randomly ...
[09:29:16] <jphase> patchy: no, doesn't need the whole path
[09:29:18] <grafi> nah patchy
[09:29:31] <jphase> you can start at the parent of the select box
[09:29:34] <jphase> or somewhere near by
[09:29:42] <jphase> whatever makes it unique in your selector
[09:29:44] <grafi> just go from the first thing up the dom from the searchbox that you can identify easily
[09:29:53] <jphase> what grafi said ^
[09:29:56] <grafi> and then select that and find the searchbox from there
[09:30:12] <grafi> you dont need to start from the document
[09:30:24] <grafi> also kill whoever invented random searchbox ids
[09:30:28] <patchy> grafi: thats the problem...all the code is using id's...
[09:30:33] <patchy> and all is changing randomly
[09:30:35] <grafi> before this stuff propagates to the outside
[09:30:42] <grafi> patchy: the fuck
[09:30:44] <grafi> ...
[09:30:44] <jphase> well that's just bad programming hehe
[09:30:52] <jphase> i mean, I know it probably wasn't you
[09:30:53] <jphase> but wtf
[09:30:59] <jphase> ids that are dynamic???
[09:31:07] <grafi> how does that even work
[09:31:10] <patchy> this code is generated from java i think...its very dirty code :P
[09:31:13] <jphase> does it not have a container that has an id/class that stays the same?
[09:31:24] <grafi> what about classes in general
[09:31:33] <grafi> or is the stylesheet stuff also dynamic
[09:31:33] <grafi> oô
[09:32:11] <patchy> well..if i use class, then i can have some slight chance that i would have duplicate of them?..correct?
[09:32:24] <jphase> patchy: not much of a choice here it sounds like
[09:32:35] <jphase> use the class with the psuedo selector :first or something
[09:32:41] <anew> Object #anonimg has no method 'append'
[09:32:41] <grafi> patchy true, but you still can get to the searchbox easy
[09:32:44] <anew> what could that mean ?
[09:32:47] <jphase> or :nth-child(2) kinda thing
[09:32:51] <anew> i have a div with id="anonimg"
[09:32:54] <anew> so not sure what the error is for
[09:32:56] <jphase> anew: jQuery isn't available at the time you append
[09:33:04] <grafi> or .eq(n)
[09:33:05] <patchy> i'm just thinking that doing it all from document will give me the security for never getting duplicates....and if i have a script where it can give me the path code in 5 sec...then it would be faster and more secure
[09:33:06] <anew> hmmm ok weird
[09:33:07] <anew> thanks
[09:33:17] <anew> ah
[09:33:18] <anew> i see
[09:33:19] <anew> thx
[09:33:21] <jphase> np
[09:34:04] <grafi> patchy, it would think you could get f*cked with every change to the dom ^^ where as starting nearer to the searchbox
[09:34:10] <grafi> will probably be more robust
[09:34:20] <grafi> also its less work
[09:34:23] <patchy> my code will become big and not that good, but...it will at least be fast to write ...and work
[09:34:26] <grafi> because the path is shorter
[09:34:58] <patchy> it will be less work if i get the code directly from that plugin?..
[09:35:03] <patchy> agree?
[09:35:10] <grafi> how does the searchbox look like?
[09:35:17] <grafi> its probably an input right?
[09:35:34] <patchy> i will check...but i will have to logon to my vpn with my work computer
[09:35:49] <patchy> can give you a look at the code...in 3-4 minutes
[09:35:55] <grafi> sweet
[09:35:55] <grafi> ;)
[09:36:33] <anew> my js loads so strangely, i mean it all works... but all the css is totally screwed up until all the js loads
[09:36:37] <anew> what can i do about that ?
[09:36:44] <jnhghy> can anybody help me with a jquery UI? it is a tooltip that doesn't trigger the colission on first hover, you can inspectthe code on the website: http://pastebin.com/6XrTwsnL
[09:37:15] <jphase> anew: put your css in your stylesheet and try to avoid using CSS in your jQuery.
[09:37:36] <anew> hmmm so i haev a few inline styles... and i'm using .append() with them
[09:37:41] <anew> that's the problem ?
[09:37:44] <jphase> well inline should be fine
[09:37:46] <jphase> i mean...
[09:37:49] <jphase> "fine"
[09:38:00] <grafi> append ôo^
[09:38:02] <grafi> what
[09:38:10] <anew> whats wrong with append
[09:38:17] <grafi> for styles?
[09:38:17] <jphase> if you add .css() attribs to your dynamically created element, it shouldn't take any time to load those styles, they're avialable b4 you append
[09:39:46] <zmode> hello again #jquery. how would i go about applying a set of css rules from a loaded css file without tampering with the object's class list?
[09:42:01] <jphase> zmode: just use a <link> tag for that, don't load css from jQuery
[09:42:18] <jphase> and if you're going to load from jQuery, create a <link> element and append to your <head>
[09:44:26] <zmode> jphase: what i'm trying to do is dynamically change the background of some cells depending on the user's actions. i already have that .css in <head> in a <link>, but because the status of the cell changes, a different rule needs to be applied
[09:45:56] <zmode> for example, when the page is served i have <td class="colorMeBlue">. when the user sets a setting, i'd like the rules from .colorMeRed to be applied and so on
[09:46:46] <jphase> zmode: just use .css for the element you want to change then
[09:47:40] <brad> anyone familar with accordion widget? trying to figure out how to change the default "open block" when the page loads
[09:47:48] <brad> right now it always picks the first
[09:48:17] <jnhghy> can anybody help me with a jquery UI? it is a tooltip that doesn't trigger the colission on first hover, you can inspectthe code on the website: http://pastebin.com/6XrTwsnL
[09:51:55] <zmode> jphase: i'm sorry. i'm not sure what you mean with "just use css" .css()?
[09:52:59] <jphase> $('#mydiv').css({border: '1px solid red', margin: '1px 2px 3px 4px'});
[09:55:06] <zmode> jphase: i have an entire set of rules though that i wouldn't like to rewrite in my .js every time i rewrite my .css.
[09:56:09] <jphase> zmode: then you could create a stylesheet and dynamically create a <link> tag and append it to your <head> like I mentioned before
[09:56:39] <zmode> jphase: alright. i'll see what i can do about that. thank you
[09:56:57] <jphase> $('<link>').prop({id: 'mynewstyles', rel: 'stylesheet', href: '/css/styles.css'}).appendTo('head');
[09:56:59] <jphase> something like that
[09:57:06] <jphase> then you can remove it as needed with the id you gave it
[09:57:15] <jphase> $('#mynewstyles').remove();
[09:58:11] <crazydiamond> Hi. Where can I find docs for things like $.support.transition ?
[09:58:43] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[09:58:51] <zmode> hmm. i'm still not sure it would work. i'm trying to do surgical styling on /one/ /user chosen/ element among hundreds
[10:02:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you there
[10:02:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: you there
[10:03:31] <jphase> hi Rohan_Bhangui
[10:03:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: good news i figured it out
[10:04:07] <jphase> sweet!
[10:04:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: ill post the code its in php though
[10:05:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/72E8X/   <--unfortunately you will have to generate own arrays and convert to js though tha tshould be easy
[10:07:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> phase: what do you think
[10:07:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> *jphase: what you think
[10:08:17] <jphase> sorry, one sec, I'm at work so I'm kinda in between being able to nerd out
[10:11:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh sry
[10:11:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill tlak to you later then
[10:11:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> if your too busy
[10:11:43] <jphase> np, I'll be available in a bit, just knee deep in photoshop and emails and my boss is doing his motivational speech
[10:11:44] <jphase> lol
[10:11:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> did you say phtoshop
[10:11:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> *photoshop
[10:12:02] <jphase> yeah
[10:12:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> now im really interested
[10:12:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> im a designer myself
[10:12:40] <jphase> I have to wear every hat possible at my job, linux server admin, designer, developer, app developer, IT, blah blah lbah
[10:12:41] <HenryCH> Hi guys, I have something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/PVQEk/4/   that for some reason isn't working as it does in the fiddle. What I'm getting is that sometimes the alert is shown and the function executes correctly (I see that it does what it's supposed to do and the log shows the correct data values passed), other times I'm simply taken to the nojavascript.html href that I entered.
[10:13:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:13:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> why not outsource?
[10:13:18] <jphase> cause we want it done correctly
[10:13:23] <HenryCH> I use php to echo the html because the data values need to be set
[10:13:40] <HenryCH> any ideas what could be causing this?
[10:14:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> first HenryCH: you can use $.post instead of $.ajax
[10:15:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> your only returning data when the ajax request is successful
[10:15:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> check for when it has an error
[10:15:19] <frothnicator1> when an element gets removed from the DOM, do it's event handlers (as via .on()) get automatically GC'd?
[10:15:29] <jphase> frothnicator1:  yes
[10:15:37] <jphase> wait, what's GC'd?
[10:15:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:15:46] <jphase> if you mean removed then yes
[10:15:47] <jphase> lol
[10:15:48] <frothnicator1> jphase: Garbage Collected
[10:16:09] <jphase> events are bound to the element so when you remove the element you also remove its events
[10:16:17] <frothnicator1> jphase: great, thanks.
[10:16:21] <jphase> np
[10:17:11] <HenryCH> ok one sec
[10:18:05] <jphase> thank god for what the font
[10:20:32] <Rohan_Bhangui>  lol
[10:21:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> HENRY: does your data need to be secure cause you can use $.get instead of $.post....its a bit faster
[10:22:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> HENRYCH: does your data need to be secure cause you can use $.get instead of $.post....its a bit faster
[10:22:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: does your data need to be secure cause you can use $.get instead of $.post....its a bit faster
[10:22:43] <HenryCH> not really
[10:23:07] <HenryCH> how do I check for when it has an error
[10:23:22] <HenryCH> if !$.post(..?
[10:23:40] <jphase> on the return function
[10:24:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: if using $.post http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[10:24:14] <jphase> $.post('url.php'. {DATAGOESHERE}, function(data){ if(data == 'error') alert('error'); });
[10:24:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> scroll down a bit there is an exmaple
[10:24:30] <jphase> or similar, but yeah docs make it easy
[10:24:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: alt. is to use a callback
[10:24:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> .fail i think
[10:24:59] <jphase> .fail is just for .ajax isn't it?
[10:25:07] <jphase> I've never used .fail on .post before, hmmm
[10:25:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> nope
[10:25:11] <jphase> neat
[10:25:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> check the link i posted
[10:25:35] <jphase> cool
[10:25:49] <jphase> and then throwing an error on the server side is done how again?
[10:25:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> you can chain .done .fail and .always
[10:26:00] <jphase> or is that just on failed post attempt?
[10:26:14] <jphase> like if the post 404's or something?
[10:26:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> well im assuming when you have .fail it will output the data similar to success function
[10:26:34] <jphase> yeah, but what fires it though?
[10:27:00] <jphase> how does it determine it failed? is that with like a 404 or 500 type response?
[10:27:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> dunno
[10:27:51] <HenryCH> I have to connect .fail to something right
[10:27:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> trying to figure that one out
[10:28:02] <HenryCH> it's outside the function
[10:28:07] <jphase> "Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is rejected."
[10:28:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> but its a callback
[10:28:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[10:28:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> interesting
[10:28:37] <jphase> still doesn't totally make sense to me
[10:29:38] <jphase> I assume it's based on the jqXHR headers
[10:29:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> maybe
[10:29:48] <jphase> 500, 502, 404, etc.
[10:29:57] <HenryCH> hm, how can I see the console output of the previous page in the developer tools?
[10:29:59] <jphase> that's why I always just use the return function
[10:30:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> could it be when the php throws error ajax understands an error has been thrown?
[10:30:13] <HenryCH> I think it's giving some error but I can't see it because im taken to the new page and the console cleans
[10:30:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: previous page?
[10:30:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> well dont redirect
[10:30:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> "simulate a page redirect
[10:30:36] <jphase> HenryCH: your network tab will show you the last post on the new page but not console
[10:30:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> but dont actually do it
[10:31:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats how i test logins when i build them
[10:32:26] <HenryCH> what can I put in the href to stop it redirecting?
[10:32:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> well are you using php to redirect
[10:32:37] <HenryCH> tried # but doesn't work
[10:32:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> or js
[10:32:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> actually wait
[10:32:58] <HenryCH> no I'm using php to echo the link, and I have the javascript with the click event
[10:33:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> why not aler the data
[10:33:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> *alert
[10:33:34] <HenryCH> but the data seems fine
[10:33:38] <n3ssi3> Hi, I'm having some problem with offsets... I get different results on the element itself and when i call .offset() on my element: http://pastie.org/8357882
[10:34:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> so why do you need to output to console HenryCH
[10:34:04] <HenryCH> the problem is the preventdefault isn't always working, sometimes I get redirected without the js function getting called
[10:34:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> does php or js handle the redirect
[10:34:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> well put the href as # and then the link as a custom attribute
[10:34:42] <HenryCH> because when I click the link I think I see some errors on the console show up, but the console then cleans out as the new page loads
[10:34:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is sent via ajax
[10:34:59] <HenryCH> I don't really need the link
[10:35:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> then use php to redirect
[10:35:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[10:35:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> then why is it there
[10:35:16] <HenryCH> no I don't want to redirect! lol
[10:35:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay if you dont need link
[10:35:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> just # it
[10:35:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> or better yet
[10:35:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> instead of link
[10:35:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> use a div
[10:35:43] <HenryCH> I just want to call the javascript function when I click the link, without redirecting me
[10:36:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> use something like <div class="join">Join</div>
[10:37:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: did that work
[10:37:38] <HenryCH> I need the link, I need soemthing to click on
[10:38:22] <HenryCH> the question is why is preventdefault only working some of the time?~
[10:39:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: you can click a div and it will work
[10:39:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> you dont need a link
[10:39:07] <jphase> HenryCH: you should use return false; instead btw
[10:39:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> i can style a div to behave like a link
[10:39:29] <HenryCH> jphase, I tried, didn't work
[10:39:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: doesnt a div work
[10:39:47] <jphase> yeah, probably not your problem, but just saying... preventDefault is no longer the way to go
[10:40:02] <HenryCH> ok, noted thanks
[10:40:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> whY?
[10:40:39] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: they're going to be using return false for future versions
[10:40:45] <jphase> not quite deprecated yet though
[10:40:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> :(
[10:41:04] <HenryCH> Seems like it only works the first time I click it
[10:41:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> so instead of event.prventDefault
[10:41:12] <HenryCH> do I have to do something to the event to free it?
[10:41:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would use return false
[10:41:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> the div?
[10:41:46] <HenryCH> the click event
[10:42:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> well is it still a link or div
[10:42:10] <HenryCH> still a link
[10:42:10] <jphase> I might be wrong about preventDefault being deprecated in future versions... cause it wouldn't make sense if you need to return something AND prevent the action
[10:42:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol true
[10:42:25] <jphase> someone told me that and now that I'm googling I think they're wrong
[10:42:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause it doesnt make sense
[10:42:47] <jphase> but if you don't need to return anything, use return false cause it's cleaner imo
[10:42:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: use a div instead of <a>
[10:43:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> it might help
[10:43:10] <HenryCH> changed to return false, still same problem
[10:43:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> use event.preventDefault
[10:43:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> and when you write click
[10:43:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> .on("click", function(event) {
[10:44:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait why are you using .click
[10:44:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: .click has been deprecated
[10:44:33] <jphase> nah
[10:44:37] <jphase> .click isn't deprecated
[10:44:40] <jphase> just an alias
[10:44:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> interesting cause when 1.9 came out
[10:45:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was told that .on "is replacing" .click and others
[10:45:20] <HenryCH> could it be the document.ready
[10:45:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> nope
[10:45:33] <HenryCH> for some reason it never gets ready again
[10:45:38] <jphase> .click() = .on('click',     just an alias
[10:45:57] <jphase> .on replaced .live though
[10:47:19] <HenryCH> could it be something to do with caching?
[10:47:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> maybe
[10:51:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: btw the solution for my problem.still has one issue
[10:51:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> it cant detect the orphan cases
[10:51:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> so when i get those....and they are pretty frequent i get errors for the chainofkilling
[10:51:34] <jphase> like put them in their own orphan array/object ?
[10:52:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> no whenever my arrays assassins and targets get scrambled they have orphan cases
[10:52:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> when i dont get orphan cases i have a perfect chain of killling
[10:52:41] <jphase> yeah that makes sense, I was going to mention that last night
[10:52:53] <HenryCH> http://jsfiddle.net/PVQEk/5/
[10:52:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i hve to find out how to prevent orphan cases
[10:53:17] <HenryCH> can't get the .post version to work on fiddle
[10:53:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> what does .data do
[10:53:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCh: see jphase posted link
[10:53:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: see jphase posted link
[10:54:17] <jphase> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[10:55:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> interesting
[10:55:18] * jphase never uses that either
[10:57:38] <HenryCH> is there no way to validate my js?
[10:58:02] <kleinerdrache> is it possible to run a function if a specific div is visible, where visible means on a long page that the user has scrolled there.  - I want to know the id of the div the users is looking on...
[10:58:13] <jphase> HenryCH: jslint
[10:58:39] <kleinerdrache> HenryCH, i normaly use firefox with the js console
[10:59:12] <jphase> kleinerdrache: .scrollTop on the $(window) might do that for you
[10:59:25] <HenryCH> jslint always gives me 30 errors
[10:59:35] <jphase> yeah, I don't use jslint anymore
[10:59:39] <jphase> but you asked hehe
[10:59:49] <HenryCH> lol :P
[10:59:49] <jphase> console is a good enough validation for me :)
[10:59:58] <HenryCH> yea but not for beginners :(
[11:00:11] <jphase> well if you don't have errors in your console then you're fine really
[11:00:30] <HenryCH> then why isn't it alerting!
[11:00:34] <jphase> if something doesn't work, you should start console.log'ing variables and make sure values are as you expect
[11:00:42] <kleinerdrache> jphase, there i get a value, so i need all the values of the position of my elements?
[11:00:44] <jphase> check all your conditionals
[11:00:46] <jphase> all your values
[11:00:47] <jphase> etc.
[11:01:30] <jphase> kleinerdrache: yeah, if($(window).scrollTop() >= $('#mydiv').scrollTop()) I think
[11:01:44] <jphase> that type of thing anyhow, I always have to look this up when I do it but that's the idea anyhow
[11:02:03] <kleinerdrache> jphase, thanks, i'll make some tests about that, maybe it works...
[11:02:12] <jphase> np
[11:04:24] <HenryCH> oh wait, the alert was outside the success function before
[11:04:52] <HenryCH> which makes sense since that would never get called on fiddle
[11:05:32] <kleinerdrache> jphase, is there an event to bind on for scrolling?
[11:05:43] <jphase> $(window).scroll()
[11:06:15] <kleinerdrache> oh, thanks again, ... i found it in the docs, i think i work to long today. :)
[11:06:24] <jphase> hehe, np
[11:09:01] <jonathancutrell> .on("scroll") works fine as well
[11:09:30] <jphase> yeah, I bet most people use .on('scroll') these days, I'm still accustomed to my lazy aliases hehe
[11:10:12] <jphase> as an ex-c programmer, saving 5 characters gives me a nerd boner
[11:25:45] <brettfrable> hey all
[11:26:33] <brettfrable> if i want to find the height between a div and the footer (which is absolutely positioned to the bottom), then add the height to another div - how would i do that
[11:26:49] <brettfrable> height being the amount of white space
[11:29:18] <webguy024> anyone familiar with mockjax? Is there a better way to grab a single object than this -> http://jsfiddle.net/webguy/HQTWW/2/
[11:57:44] <aniasis> When I am using on for a delegated event, why do I have to use a selector instead of a jQ object?
[11:59:05] <NoiseEee> what do you mean aniasis
[12:00:32] <Zzaichik> Are you wanting to trigger an event when a function is called?
[12:02:04] <newbzzz> Good afternoon. I hope you could help me out. How would I add the window.scrollTo(0, 0); property into a pre-existing javascript code that opens up an off canvas top menu? The menu opens up fine, but the div that has the controls is Fixed and so I need the button to scroll to the top everytime someone clicks the menu when further down the page. The link is a screenshot of the code I want to add the scrollTo function to: http://oi42.
[12:06:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I have a submit button inside a jqueryui dialog... the submit should retrieve stuff from database and list it INSIDE the dialog
[12:06:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is this possible? How to catch that click?
[12:10:46] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: yeah, you can bind a click event to the button in a dialog Look at the second code sample: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[12:11:19] <jphase> in your buttons array you can just pass a click event in that button's object
[12:11:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> But what if I have the button added in my own html? Not in the .dialog function?
[12:11:41] <jphase> oh, then you bind an event to the element as you create it
[12:11:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[12:11:54] <jphase> $('<button>').click(function(){    type thing
[12:11:58] <jnhghy> can anybody help me with a jquery UI? it is a tooltip that doesn't trigger the colission on first hover, you can inspectthe code on the website: http://pastebin.com/6XrTwsnL
[12:12:05] <jnhghy> please help ^
[12:12:24] <jphase> jnhghy: "This paste has been removed!"
[12:12:29] <jnhghy> http://pastebin.com/FQWTsAaF
[12:12:31] <jphase> try making a jsfiddle with it
[12:12:32] <jnhghy> sorry
[12:12:39] <jnhghy> it's link to live page
[12:12:51] <jphase> oh okay
[12:13:52] <jphase> so what's the issue?
[12:13:59] <jphase> can't find it
[12:15:09] <jnhghy> jphase:there are 4 columns of images... if you hover on the 4th (the most to the right image) image the tooltip will be small and on it's wright, if you hover again, it will be fliped and fit. It should be fliped and fit on the first hover also
[12:15:40] <jnhghy> jphase: if an image has to be flipped because is displayed to low, it will be fliped and fited only starting from 2nd mouse hover
[12:16:40] <jphase> hmm, what browser are you using, I can't seem to reproduce this problem in chrome
[12:16:51] <jnhghy> I'm also using chrome
[12:16:52] <jphase> it's a normal sized tooltip on the right every time when I hover over the 4th image
[12:16:54] <jphase> weird
[12:17:15] <jnhghy> jphase: I can make some print screens...
[12:17:26] <jphase> yeah if you don't mind, I'm going to go grab some pizza, brb
[12:19:20] <patchy> jphase: i downloaded firepath...and i can put in the xpath into it to find the element, but what about conversion to jquery selector? does it do that?
[12:19:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: im back
[12:20:12] <dot_> hello is there any good visual form builder ?
[12:20:27] <grafi> patchy what about the code? ^^
[12:21:23] <aniasis> Is there a way I can get an element's selector with index?
[12:21:32] <patchy> grafi: i found out that in some cases i have some classes i can use
[12:21:39] <grafi> cool ;)
[12:21:49] <grafi> but youre still going the complicated way ^^
[12:21:52] <dot_> hello is there any good visual form builder ?
[12:22:03] <grafi> ?g good visual form builder
[12:22:04] <b-ot> grafi: WordPress › Visual Form Builder « WordPress Plugins → http://wordpress.org/plugins/visual-form-builder/
[12:22:10] <patchy> grafi: but again, it would be nice to just have the code by one click, not having to write
[12:22:10] <grafi> ?g good visual form builder jquery
[12:22:11] <b-ot> grafi: Visual JQuery UI form designer - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4222221/visual-jquery-ui-form-designer
[12:22:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: hey im back
[12:23:30] <grafi> patchy i stll think the whole path might not be robust enough against changes
[12:24:13] <BillCriswell> :-D
[12:24:15] <dot_> hmmm
[12:24:18] <grafi> i mean even something like $('input[type="text"]').eq(n), where n is the index of the searchbox input should be better than the whole path
[12:24:25] <patchy> grafi: yeah, but this code will never change
[12:24:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> general question: is it possible to tune the jquery ui theme to have a flat design
[12:24:42] <patchy> grafi: i wanna use greasemonkey because the vendor cannot change the code..hehe
[12:24:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you there?
[12:25:05] <BillCriswell> Rohan_Bhangui: Strip all the fancy stuff from the CSS.
[12:25:09] <grafi> then using something like $('input').eq(n) is even better patchy
[12:25:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCrishwell: thanks
[12:25:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: thanks
[12:25:43] <grafi> yuck, flat ui ^^
[12:25:54] <dot_> i am looking for something like this grafi
[12:25:54] <dot_> http://codecanyon.net/item/visual-form-builder-beautiful-forms-in-seconds/162388
[12:26:13] <patchy> grafi: yeah..i understand what you are saying..but i still wanna do it this way to make it easyer...then i dont have to learn how to do dom...then i have to use many houres troubleshooting code just cause i cannot make the path's...with some stupid newb errors :P
[12:26:14] <jphase> I like flat UIs, tons of shadows and rounded corners remind me of Photoshop 4.0
[12:26:35] <jphase> "BEVELS AND ROUNDED AND SHADOWS YEAH!" haha
[12:26:47] <grafi> patchy but the suggested way using firepath doesnt seem to work to well for you, does it? ;9
[12:26:48] <jphase> I mean, even medium between the two of course
[12:27:01] <grafi> you installed a plugin and now you have a path you cant use
[12:27:14] <grafi> maybe search for something xpath/jquery ...
[12:27:15] <grafi> idk
[12:27:33] <jnhghy> jphase: 1st hover on a image from the 4th column: http://imagebin.org/272007  2nd hover: http://imagebin.org/272008
[12:28:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: reason why i ask about jquery ui flat stuff is cause ive been avoiding jquery ui and finally realised that it is neccessary when build web apps...for faster deployment vs. bulding from scratch
[12:28:27] <patchy> grafi: yeah..have tried..hehhee
[12:28:34] <jphase> jnhghy: I definitely see the problem on your screenshot, just not happening for me
[12:28:36] <jphase> so weird
[12:28:42] <patchy> grafi: i just cannot understand why nobody has made something like this before :P heheh
[12:28:58] <grafi> because its useless in general
[12:29:00] <jphase> jnhghy: it shows up to the right every time for me
[12:29:03] <grafi> :P
[12:29:11] <jphase> ohh, perhaps it's my resolution
[12:29:14] <patchy> grafi: hhehe yeah
[12:29:33] <jphase> jnhghy: ahh yeah, I just have a HUGE monitor so I had to resize my browser down
[12:29:44] <patchy> grafi: thanks for helping me although I seem completely hopeless :) heheh
[12:29:49] <jnhghy> jphase: I have another example for a bottom image: http://imagebin.org/272009 on fist hove and http://imagebin.org/272010 on second
[12:30:06] <grafi> sure no problem
[12:30:40] <jnhghy> jphase:how HUGE is your monitor? :))
[12:30:54] <patchy> grafi: css selector, will that be the same thing? or?
[12:31:06] <jphase> idk, big enough for the tooltip to always be on the right unless I resize my browser
[12:31:24] <jphase> 1920x something or other prolly
[12:32:04] <jnhghy> jphase: I see... any thoughts why is this happening?
[12:32:18] * jphase is brainstorming
[12:32:24] <dot_> i am looking for something like this grafi
[12:32:25] <dot_> http://codecanyon.net/item/visual-form-builder-beautiful-forms-in-seconds/162388
[12:33:09] <jphase> jnhghy: where's your tooltip call?
[12:33:10] <grafi> patchy same thing as?
[12:33:25] <patchy> jquery selector
[12:33:29] <jnhghy> what do you mean? tooltip call?
[12:33:39] <aniasis> Is there anyway to use delegated events without a selector if for example I am cloning an element?
[12:33:48] <grafi> basically
[12:34:03] <grafi> dot_ ive seen something like this recently, but i cant find the link
[12:34:19] <jphase> jnhghy: .tooltip()
[12:34:21] <aniasis> Because theorectically I have a new selector for each cloned element
[12:34:25] <NoiseEee> aniasis: what do you mean?
[12:34:36] <NoiseEee> aniasis: then put the delegate higher
[12:34:41] <jqN00b> With jQuery Mobile dialogs, when I click buttons my onclick handler gets called, but window.open redirect in the handler does not does not.  In fact, the button does not even go to the link in the <a href...>.  How am I supposed to handle button clicks in jQuery mobile dialogs?
[12:34:42] <Velveeta> aniasis: can you not make some kind of normalized selector that you add to for each unique instance?
[12:35:00] <Velveeta> e.g. if you have class items, clone it and make class="items first", class="items second" etc
[12:35:00] <NoiseEee> $(someElementHigherThanEverythingCloned).on('click','.classOfThingsICareAbout',function(){}); @ aniasis
[12:35:01] <jnhghy> jphase: I have the <a href ...> that has the class "tooltip" and it uses it's "rel" for the image inside the tooltip
[12:35:13] <grafi> dot_ you mean like to use it yourself or to put on your site?
[12:35:13] <jnhghy> jphase: in the jquery script?
[12:35:18] <jphase> jnhghy: yeah... so where do you call .tooltip()?
[12:35:23] <grafi> dot_ because the one you posted can be used like that ^^
[12:35:25] <Velveeta> and then your delegate selector could still focus on that normalized selector
[12:35:28] <jphase> $('.tooltip').tooltip(); for example
[12:35:34] <grafi> dot_ if you just want to bang out a form
[12:35:40] <jnhghy> jphase: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19016320/jquery-ui-colission-not-triggering-at-first-hover here :)
[12:35:43] <jphase> $(document).tooltip(); etc.
[12:36:27] <jphase> jnhghy:  you need to have .tooltip() somewhere in order for UI to use tooltips, so where do you do that?
[12:36:34] <jphase> which JS file do you call .tooltip() in ?
[12:36:38] <jphase> not sure how else to ask this...
[12:36:55] <jnhghy> jphase: have you checked the webpage from so? that I've linked?
[12:36:57] <jphase> please show me teh .tooltip() in your live site, which .js file plz kthxbye
[12:37:14] <jphase> oh jeese, okay it's literally in a script tag on the page
[12:37:15] <jphase> haha
[12:37:21] <jphase> I expected this to be in a .js file somewhere
[12:37:26] <jnhghy> jphase: yap ... not in a js file
[12:37:55] <aniasis> Velveeta, explain
[12:38:38] <jphase> jnhghy: I really don't think this should be the issue, but for the hell of it, change your doc ready wrapper to a jQuery(window).load wrapper
[12:38:53] <NoiseEee> aniasis: perhaps you're missing the essence of event delegation?
[12:38:55] <jphase> I just want to see if it behaves the same if you call post-resources-loaded
[12:40:14] <patchy> grafi: is this a valid jquery path? #df-86-bd1aab74 a
[12:40:15] <jphase> oh, perhaps this is from dynamic content...
[12:40:29] <grafi> patchy sure
[12:40:40] <grafi> but you said the ids were random
[12:40:55] <jnhghy> jphase: will do... but ... I don't see where I have the doc ready wrapper. is the first jQuery(function(){ ...} ? that should be changed to jQuery(window).load(function(){ ...} ?
[12:41:02] <grafi> which is still kind of fucked up ^^
[12:41:05] <patchy> grafi: yeah..i was just testing on another site :)
[12:41:11] <grafi> ;)
[12:41:12] <jphase> jnhghy: that acts as you doc ready yeah
[12:41:25] <jnhghy> jphase:ok, one moment
[12:41:27] <patchy> grafi: i will try to test with this tool :)
[12:41:31] <jphase> I doubt that's the issue though :`[  lemme look into something as you try that
[12:41:36] <patchy> grafi: http://selectorgadget.com/
[12:42:00] <grafi> if the ids are random though
[12:42:04] <grafi> it wont help you
[12:42:05] <grafi> ...
[12:46:28] <rosco_y> Can anyone tell me why my simple jQuery dialog example isn't opening in jsfiddle?  http://jsfiddle.net/4UL9p/4/
[12:47:39] <squeakytoy> you are getting a javascript error
[12:47:45] <jphase> rosco_y: include jQuery UI in your fiddle
[12:47:46] <squeakytoy> open the console, f12, and read the error
[12:48:12] <jphase> rosco_y: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/QgPEw/42/
[12:48:53] <jnhghy> jphase: I was dissconnected, have you pasted anything? hope I'm not stressing you too much with this :)
[12:49:19] <jphase> jnhghy: haven't pasted anything yet, this is a tough issue to track down...
[12:49:26] <aniasis> NoiseEee Velveeta, the problem is that I binding events in an each loop.  Therefore I need a very specific selector
[12:49:35] <aniasis> for current element
[12:49:39] <aniasis> current element
[12:49:40] <jphase> makes me think you actually found a bug in jQuery UI - which is sort of like finding a unicorn
[12:49:41] <aniasis> elements
[12:49:53] <NoiseEee> aniasis: and my question is, why are you binding at that point?  it sounds like you don't understand event delegation.
[12:49:55] <aniasis> Because subsequent binds will be easy
[12:49:56] <NoiseEee> $(someElementHigherThanEverythingCloned).on('click','.classOfThingsICareAbout',function(){}); @ aniasis
[12:50:30] <NoiseEee> aniasis: what aer you trying to do, what problem are you trying to solve
[12:50:38] <aniasis> NoiseEee, because there are elements on the page at page load.  And I just want to create one bind
[12:50:52] <tgodar> must be some way to tell jQuery UI where its image assets for themes live no?  What should I google for?  or is it hard coded to be relative to where the css file lives?
[12:50:55] <aniasis> I don't want to write multiple event binding statements
[12:51:01] <NoiseEee> aniasis: but you *just* said " the problem is that I binding events in an each loop.  Therefore I need a very specific selector"
[12:51:08] <aniasis> Yes
[12:51:10] <jnhghy> jphase: I doubt it, it is visible on any time a collision happens, it would have been noticed (I'm thinking...)
[12:51:22] <NoiseEee> $(someElementHigherThanEverythingCloned).on('click','.classOfThingsICareAbout',function(){}); @ aniasis - does that not solve the problem we are talking about?
[12:51:49] <jphase> yeah, but I don't see anyone else with the same issue and the fact that it only occurs on first hover makes me raise an eyebrow :\
[12:51:58] <aniasis> sorry yeah.  I am binding to high
[12:52:03] <aniasis> up
[12:52:18] <NoiseEee> aniasis: i can't follow the issue, i'm sorry.
[12:53:08] <Z_A_M> Hi -- If I have a button that looks like this <button class="link">4545459</button> How do I select the value of the button? .val() and .attr("value") aren't working. I can add a value to the button but I want to know why this isn't working too.
[12:53:22] <aniasis> NoiseEee, nevermind I got it
[12:53:57] <jphase> Z_A_M: $('button.link').text() or .contents() would also work
[12:55:24] <jphase> jnhghy: have you tried adding a tooltipClass and having a min-width on that in CSS?
[12:55:36] <jphase> since it seems to be a problem with the tooltip size on first hover
[12:55:50] <rosco_y> jphase: ty
[12:56:00] <jphase> np
[12:56:08] <jnhghy> jphase: I'll add the min-width in css, what is a tooltip class? how do I add that?
[12:57:48] <jphase> .tooltip({ tooltipClass: "custom-tooltip-styling" });
[12:58:30] <Z_A_M> jphase: let me try
[13:00:05] <Z_A_M> jphase: with contents() I get the following errors --- slice.call( docElem.childNodes, 0 )[0].nodeType; value = jQuery.isFunction( value ) ? value() : ( value == null ? "" : value );
[13:01:42] <rosco_y> jphase: do you know why I don't see the jQuery UI checkbox in my fiddle?
[13:02:20] <jphase> rosco_y: what's your fiddle?
[13:02:41] <rosco_y> http://jsfiddle.net/4UL9p/4/
[13:02:54] <jqN00b> In jQuery mobile, are there any data-rel other than 'dialog' or 'back'?
[13:03:05] <jnhghy> jphase: the issue is not only with the width, as the height has also issues.... terible issue...
[13:03:05] <jphase> rosco_y: again, you don't have jQuery UI in your fiddle
[13:03:30] <jphase> jnhghy: yeah but in this case the collision applies mainly to the width here so that might just be a good work around
[13:03:42] <rosco_y> jphase: ty, my question is (I see that you version works), but I can't find the
[13:03:52] <rosco_y> I can't find the "jQuery UI" checkbox
[13:04:11] <jphase> rosco_y: pick a version of jQuery > 1.6
[13:04:14] <jphase> that's old and moldy
[13:04:17] <jphase> 1.9.1 for example
[13:04:17] <Z_A_M> jphase: I got it to work by just putting a value="" with the button, but now no matter what button I click I get the same value.
[13:04:19] <rosco_y> also, my jQuery options only go up to 1.6.
[13:04:30] <rosco_y> I wonder if my cache needs to be refreshed
[13:04:37] <jphase> rosco_y: hmm... no they don't, try that drop down again
[13:04:43] <jphase> I'm literally changing it right now on your fiddle
[13:04:45] <rosco_y> ok
[13:05:02] <jphase> Z_A_M: erm.... idk what you're trying to do with that exactly, but with an element like <button>blah</button> $('button').text() will return "blah"
[13:06:20] <jphase> rosco_y: any luck?
[13:06:52] <Z_A_M> jphase: Not for me...in respect with your example I get "blahblahblahblahblah" returned back.
[13:06:59] <rosco_y> jphase: http://imagebin.org/272013
[13:07:11] <jphase> Z_A_M: that's cause you have several buttons or the action is happening several times
[13:07:26] <aniasis> NoiseEee, this is the problem I am having... http://jsfiddle.net/vNbay/
[13:07:34] <Z_A_M> oo okay
[13:07:45] <jphase> rosco_y: yeah... don't choose the bottom.... hehe choose 1.9.1
[13:07:52] <jphase> 1.6 is old and gross
[13:08:16] <jphase> "jQuery 1.9.1"
[13:08:18] <rosco_y> jphase: (doh)  thanks!
[13:08:22] <jphase> ;)
[13:08:32] <aniasis> the event fires too many times
[13:08:35] <rosco_y> Perfect :)
[13:09:08] <NoiseEee> aniasis: what's the desired result?
[13:09:09] <Z_A_M> jphase: I have several buttons they all are the same class. Isn't there a way to get just the 1 button the user clicked?
[13:09:27] <aniasis> That the bind event only fire once per form
[13:09:46] <jphase> Z_A_M: $('.button:first').text() ?
[13:09:54] <jphase> depends on which one you want to grab really
[13:10:02] <NoiseEee> aniasis: what's the result, in english.  what should happen that's not happening now?  i should only get the letter i typed and the 'data' of the form i typed in?
[13:10:18] <jphase> Z_A_M:  $('.button').eq(3).text() = the 4th button's text for example
[13:10:31] <Z_A_M> jphase: ahh
[13:10:46] <Z_A_M> jphase: well I did not know that. Thank you.
[13:10:47] <jphase> or you can do :first, :last, :nth-child(3) in the selector
[13:10:47] <aniasis> NoiseEee, but it call alert 3 times
[13:10:49] <jphase> that type stuff
[13:10:51] <jphase> np
[13:11:04] <NoiseEee> aniasis: please answer my question, what's the desired result?
[13:11:21] <aniasis> that it only call alert 1 time.
[13:11:22] <NoiseEee> aniasis: in english.  what should happen after i enter a letter in the 2nd input box?
[13:11:23] <Z_A_M> jphase: isn't there a way to get the text value of that one button specifically instead of all of them?
[13:11:27] <Z_A_M> jphase: or is it not
[13:11:42] <jphase> Z_A_M: "that one" = what exactly?
[13:11:48] <jphase> the first one? the one clicked?
[13:11:48] <NoiseEee> aniasis: should it be:  theLetterITyped + "y"   ?
[13:11:59] <Z_A_M> jphase: the one clicked
[13:12:06] <Dudi> hello I can't do that var $calculatedWidth = $(this).css('width') - $totalWidth; ?
[13:12:23] <jphase> Z_A_M: $('button').click(function(){ alert($(this).text()); });
[13:12:44] <Z_A_M> ah this!
[13:12:47] <jphase> Dudi: use .width() instead
[13:12:53] <Z_A_M> jphase: sorry for the bother
[13:12:59] <jphase> Dudi: .css('width') has "px" or whatever unit on the end
[13:13:04] <jphase> Z_A_M: no bother
[13:13:27] <NoiseEee> aniasis: what should happen after i enter a letter in the 2nd input box? should it be:  theLetterITyped + "y"   ?
[13:13:30] <aniasis> NoiseEee,  it should be the letter you type then it should not execute another alert
[13:13:44] <aniasis> NoiseEee, no
[13:14:05] <NoiseEee> aniasis: then what's the 'param' variable about?
[13:14:08] <aniasis> I am not bind for all inputs in the $.on method
[13:14:25] <aniasis> I only want one bind per form
[13:14:36] <aniasis> Right now there a 3 binds
[13:14:48] <Dudi> jphase thx :D
[13:14:50] <NoiseEee> aniasis: you need to get your terminology straight, first of all
[13:14:53] <jphase> np
[13:15:01] <aniasis> What don't you understand?
[13:15:21] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/vNbay/1/ @ aniasis
[13:16:18] <aniasis> NoiseEee, but I have to traverse the DOM to get the data attribute
[13:16:30] <aniasis> That is not what I want
[13:16:41] <NoiseEee> aniasis: i asked you about that, you said you didn't need it... NoiseEee,  it should be the letter you type
[13:16:46] <NoiseEee> aniasis: and i asked what the 'param' was about
[13:17:30] <aniasis> It should be the letter you typed and the data attribute of the parent form
[13:17:59] <NoiseEee> aniasis: which is precisely what i first asked you when i said "what should happen after i enter a letter in the 2nd input box? should it be:  theLetterITyped + "y"   ?"   and you replied no .  So stop making this so difficult.
[13:18:37] <aniasis> ok sure.  Do you have a solution?
[13:19:16] <NoiseEee> aniasis: http://jsfiddle.net/vNbay/2/
[13:19:31] <ilem_> hi, i was hoping someone could help me with the jquery validation plugin, i am trying to return a specific error message based on multiple conditionals but not having any luck...
[13:19:33] <ilem_> http://jsfiddle.net/SHWj5/1/
[13:19:47] <aniasis> NoiseEee, that is exactly what I don't want to do
[13:19:54] <NoiseEee> aniasis: why?
[13:20:09] <aniasis> Because I don't want to.
[13:20:16] <NoiseEee> great, good luck.
[13:20:19] <NoiseEee> ./ignore
[13:20:21] <ilem_> if no state is selected and the country is "X" return "X", if it's "Y" return "Y", etc
[13:20:54] <aniasis> That means I will have to use that bind in addition to event delegation
[13:21:06] <NoiseEee> aniasis: wat?
[13:21:32] <NoiseEee> aniasis: wtf does "bind" mean to you?
[13:21:50] <NoiseEee> aniasis: what does " I will have to use that bind in addition to event delegation" mean?!
[13:21:55] <aniasis> NoiseEee, what does it mean to you?
[13:22:10] <NoiseEee> the way you're using, absolutely nothing.
[13:22:30] <aniasis> bind an event?
[13:22:37] <aniasis> does that mean something to you?
[13:22:58] <NoiseEee> sure, but your claim " I will have to use that bind in addition to event delegation" means nothing.
[13:23:19] <NoiseEee> what is the "bind" to you?  looking for the event target?  looking for its parent form?
[13:23:34] <NoiseEee> again, i go back to "you don't understand event delegation"
[13:23:46] <aniasis> What is there to understand?
[13:23:59] <NoiseEee> obviously for you quite a bit, compared to your first example and where we are now.
[13:24:00] <aniasis> Or rather what am I not understanding
[13:24:18] <NoiseEee> what makes you say "i dont want to do the method you've shown works"
[13:24:24] <NoiseEee> other than "because i don't want to"
[13:25:30] <aniasis> NoiseEee, you see the example I posted?  What am I doing?
[13:26:01] <NoiseEee> aniasis: something that's not getting you your desired result?
[13:26:15] <NoiseEee> iterating through 'form' elements for no reason?
[13:26:49] <aniasis> I am traversing all the forms in the DOM and binding events of child elements.
[13:27:14] <NoiseEee> aniasis: which is useless since you said you wish to add future <form> elements.
[13:27:55] <NoiseEee> im having difficulty following you in general.  you present a case saying "THIS NOT WORK, HOW TO GET RESULT I WANT", then we GET the result you want, but it's not QUITE the result you want for some unknown reason.
[13:27:57] <NoiseEee> so good luck!!
[13:28:04] <NoiseEee> maybe someone else can step in to help you.
[13:28:18] <aniasis> I never said that I am adding future form elements
[13:29:38] <aniasis> my only real question was how do I get a specific selector for each element on the page
[13:35:28] <seba4> hi to all i got some problem i hope someone is here:) i suspect it is simple but dont know how to make it
[13:35:39] <seba4> on click i can call $(this)
[13:36:33] <seba4> but if i just got if ($(".something").val() == true ) { $(this)
[13:36:38] <seba4> i cant use it like that
[13:36:49] <seba4> on load i need to check some things and just change them..
[13:36:58] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this @ seba4
[13:40:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is it possible to insert at table row between to other rows, but by index?
[13:41:01] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: yeah, just grab the row with a selector or with .eq()
[13:41:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If I do this: var index = $("#dataTable tr").index($(this));
[13:41:28] <jphase> not quite
[13:41:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what would happen if I append the row at index ?
[13:41:48] <Dudi> I want remove div but every one have the same class and I want compare it by inner text
[13:41:51] <Dudi> is it possible
[13:41:52] <Dudi> ?
[13:41:59] <jphase> $('#dataTable tr:nth-child(1)')   or    $('#dataTable tr').eq(1) kinda thing
[13:42:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that's where to append it?
[13:43:00] <jphase> yeah something like that
[13:43:18] <jphase> so that example would be for the 2nd <tr>
[13:45:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it says nth-child is unrecognized expression :(
[13:45:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob>  $("#dataTable tr:nth-child("+rowindex+")")
[13:45:36] <jphase> oh maybe I'm wrong on that one
[13:45:43] <jphase> sec
[13:45:53] <jphase> nah that's right
[13:45:58] <jphase> http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[13:46:05] <jphase> oh, 4n
[13:46:12] <jphase> haha
[13:46:13] <jphase> nvm
[13:46:16] <jphase> so use :eq
[13:46:27] <jphase> $('#dataTable tr:eq(1)') for example
[13:46:34] <jphase> I'm mixing my selectors
[13:46:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[13:46:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx
[13:46:57] <Dudi> i found all intrested me div by ar $selectedUsers = $("#user-select").find('.selected-user'); and now I want check .text() of last item and remove it by when I try use .text() then I get msg that Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'text' wtf?
[13:47:03] <Dudi> is it possible?
[13:49:58] <jphase> Dudi: it is possible, but if you don't have a .text() method then you either don't have jQuery defined or what you're using .text() on isn't a jQuery object
[13:53:00] <Dudi> jphase, so if I find div by var $selectedUsers = $("#user-select").find('.selected-user'); event then I can't have 100% that $selectedusers[1] will be jquery object?
[13:55:17] <aniasis> Can anyone tell me why the alert is firing 3 times in this code? http://jsfiddle.net/JsySj/
[13:56:27] <Dudi> aniasis because it goes for every div?
[13:57:32] <jphase> aniasis: it's because you have 3 forms that match that .each() selector
[13:58:36] <s2013_> i have jquery autocomplete but its returning blank dropdown.. i think i need value but i dont know wher eto put it
[13:58:50] <s2013_> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/a7b1b28ea9b552ff27d3 this is my code
[13:59:24] <Dudi> wait a sec
[13:59:53] <aniasis> jphase, but the selector I am using is specific enough that it should only fire 1 time.
[13:59:54] <jphase> aniasis:  you're binding keyup events to the entire document (which is silly btw), but you're just adding 3 different keyup events on the entire document
[14:00:00] <jphase> no
[14:00:02] <jphase> not true
[14:00:07] <jphase> you're adding keyup events to the document
[14:00:14] <jphase> $(document) should change to $(this) for example
[14:00:35] <s2013_> anyone?
[14:01:07] <jphase> s2013_: I need to see the entire code to help
[14:01:25] <Dudi> s2013_ first link in google http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[14:01:28] <jphase> I don't do coffee
[14:01:35] <jphase> I'm more of a tea guy myself ;)
[14:01:49] <s2013_> Dudi, obviously i have been there...
[14:02:08] <Dudi> s2013_code then
[14:02:10] <jphase> aniasis: since $('[data-d]') matches 3 forms, you are adding 3 keyup events to the entire document, thus having each alert firing three times
[14:02:18] <aniasis> jphase, I am adding them to the document, but what is the selector argument for on that $.on method?
[14:03:14] <s2013_> i pasted code. thats petty much all i have
[14:03:51] <aniasis> jphase, I am adding 1 keyup event for each form that matches $('[data-d]').
[14:04:16] <aniasis> There are 3 forms so I am adding 3 keyup events to the document.
[14:04:19] <s2013_> http://jsfiddle.net/FndMx/
[14:04:55] <aniasis> jphase, but there is a specific selector for each keyup event
[14:06:45] <jphase> aniasis: use relative stuff man, don't .each if you don't have to: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/JsySj/1/
[14:07:03] <jphase> data value is off, but w/e
[14:07:21] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/JsySj/2/
[14:07:22] <jphase> there
[14:07:50] <aniasis> jphase, tell me why this works then... http://jsfiddle.net/hjZHA/
[14:07:56] <jphase> I have no clue what that blurb of code above there is
[14:08:28] <jphase> you CAN loop through each input, but there's no need to
[14:08:39] <jphase> when you use a selector, jQuery is already looping through each element
[14:08:57] <jphase> in this new fiddle though, they're just using an array of stirngs
[14:09:04] <jphase> that represent selectors
[14:09:18] <jphase> this code isn't even clean imo, but much cleaner than the other
[14:09:40] <aniasis> jphase, they both do the same thing
[14:10:03] <aniasis> the second is just a hard-coded selector and I derive a selector in the first
[14:10:04] <jphase> aniasis: you do whatever you want man, I'm just telling you what I, an many other people that care about their code, would do
[14:10:17] <jphase> you can use an array of selectors, that's fine, there's no problem with that
[14:10:34] <jphase> but if you bind your keyup to your document everytime
[14:10:41] <jphase> then OF COURSE you get three alerts
[14:10:43] <jphase> ;P
[14:10:48] <s2013_> anyone?
[14:11:00] <aniasis> jphase, Why when I use a specific selector?
[14:11:13] <jphase> $(document) is specific to the document hehe
[14:11:32] <raj> shoky, my n1&&4?
[14:11:49] <jphase> aniasis: if you add 5 keyup events to the document, that will happen 5 times on keyup, you understand??
[14:12:17] <jphase> you can pass the selector in .on like your second fiddle though yes
[14:12:28] <jphase> but why? just change the event to bind to the element in question
[14:13:46] <Dudi> why I'm getting html elements not jquery element as result of $(#id).find(.class) ?
[14:13:53] <jphase> aniasis:  like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/JsySj/3/
[14:14:30] <jphase> Dudi: you mean .find('.class') right?
[14:14:56] <Dudi> jphase ofc, just a typo
[14:15:06] <Dudi> same story in '#id'
[14:15:06] <jphase> idk Dudi, fiddle it
[14:15:12] <Dudi> k
[14:20:03] <aniasis> jphase, here it is!
[14:20:16] <aniasis> @jphase http://jsfiddle.net/JsySj/4/
[14:20:51] <jphase> aniasis: do whatever you want, next time don't ask for advice here and waste our time
[14:21:12] <jphase> myself and many other people here are at work and we don't have time to just tell you shit that you ignore
[14:21:15] <jphase> RTFM
[14:22:01] <aniasis> I am at work too.  You wanted me to use your design because you thought it was better when I was asking you a question specifically about the API
[14:22:27] <aniasis> Don't be mad at me.
[14:22:37] <jphase> aniasis: lol, whatever dude, next time just read the fucking API docs if you have questions about the API
[14:22:52] <jphase> RTFM = read the fucking manual
[14:22:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[14:23:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> why he pissoff?
[14:23:28] <aniasis> Rohan_Bhangui, idk because I didn't accept his design approach
[14:23:34] <s2013_> my json is returning an array of objects, not array of strings
[14:23:38] <s2013_> i think thats where the issue is
[14:23:55] <jphase> lol, aniasis you were binding 3 keyup events to the entire document and wondering why it alerted 3 times
[14:24:02] <aniasis> jphase, You were so busy telling me my design approach was wrong that you failed to realize that I was passing in an argument of the incorrect type
[14:24:03] <s2013_> in my autocomplete how do i just display the name while its being searched
[14:24:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> well im not gonna even try to mediate, nor am i gonna spend the energy to get to the bottom
[14:24:09] <jphase> not passing the correct child selector
[14:24:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> but usually aniasis when you ask for help (whihc i am assuming) usually its best to use it
[14:24:55] <jphase> aniasis: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+write+jquery
[14:25:08] <aniasis> Rohan_Bhangui, I was not asking for help with my design I was asking help with my code.
[14:25:26] <jphase> yeah and when I told you what was wrong you ignored me lol
[14:25:43] <jphase> you were binding 3 events to your entire document and wondering why it fired 3 times lol
[14:25:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: exmaple code
[14:25:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> i gotta see this
[14:26:06] <jphase> scroll ^
[14:26:11] <jphase> I'm busy doing non-nub shit
[14:26:15] <aniasis> You didn't tell me the argument I was passing was an array and not a string
[14:26:51] <aniasis> Rohan_Bhangui, this is the original http://jsfiddle.net/JsySj/ and this is the correct http://jsfiddle.net/JsySj/4/
[14:27:30] <aniasis> Rohan_Bhangui, jphase is just mad I didn't want to accept his rudimentary solution to my problem
[14:27:44] <jphase> lmao
[14:27:57] <jphase> aniasis: you're just mad that you don't have .selector anymore cause it's deprecated
[14:28:12] <jphase> and you also pissed of NoiseEe as well so it's not just me calling you a noob
[14:28:16] <aniasis> jphase, you mad!
[14:28:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> guys chill
[14:28:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> aniasis: did you get your problem solved?
[14:28:49] <aniasis> jphase, if I bound it to the document or any ancestor it would have done the same thing!
[14:29:12] <aniasis> The problem was the type was incorrect.  But you were so busy looking at the design that you failed to see the run-time issue
[14:29:24] <aniasis> Rohan_Bhangui, Yes I solved it myself
[14:29:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey, dont judge me
[14:29:35] <jphase> NoiseEee: great, good luck.
[14:29:35] <jphase> NoiseEee: ./ignore
[14:29:35] <jphase> NoiseEee: aniasis: wat?
[14:29:45] <jphase> NoiseEee: aniasis: wtf does "bind" mean to you?
[14:29:45] <jphase> NoiseEee: aniasis: what does " I will have to use that bind in addition to event delegation" mean?!
[14:29:45] <jphase> aniasis: NoiseEee, what does it mean to you?
[14:29:47] <jphase> lol
[14:29:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[14:30:21] <aniasis> What?
[14:30:29] <aniasis> There is nothing wrong with what I said.
[14:30:32] <jphase> aniasis: when you bind 3 events to document (not using a child selector) it chains the events, thus firing it 3 times
[14:30:43] <aniasis> I used a child selector!
[14:30:49] <jphase> incorrectly yes
[14:30:54] <jphase> therefore binding to the entire document
[14:30:56] <aniasis> Dude the type was wrong!
[14:31:00] <jphase> you know what, you're seriously not worth my attention right now

[14:32:35] <newbeen> hello
[14:32:56] <patchy> if i'm going to change the width of a <li> inside a <ul id="search">..what will the code be then?
[14:33:09] <patchy> $('body').find("ul[id=search]").css('width','600px'); <---- this is how far i am now..hehe
[14:33:19] <patchy> the html is like this: <ul id="search"><li></li></ul>
[14:33:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> newbeen: hello
[14:33:46] <Velveeta> patchy: you should change the width of the ul and let the li flow to fit its container
[14:33:56] * Rohan_Bhangui agrees
[14:34:13] <jphase|working> patchy: $('ul#search > li').css('width', '600px');
[14:34:22] <jphase|working> yeah
[14:34:24] <Velveeta> ok, i'm off drink now
[14:34:30] <patchy> ahh..thanks
[14:34:32] <Velveeta> good luck, and science speed!
[14:34:53] <patchy> jphase|working: can i use > several times ...to make a long path if i want?
[14:35:09] <jphase|working> patchy: that's just for the first child of that element
[14:35:23] <patchy> ahh, ok
[14:35:31] <jphase|working> sorry, not "first child" like the selector
[14:35:35] <jphase|working> but first level of children rather
[14:35:41] <patchy> what if there is several?
[14:35:46] <jphase|working> remove >
[14:35:52] <jphase|working> will grab all <li> recursively
[14:36:37] <patchy> <ul id="search"><li><img></li></ul> <-- what about the img then?
[14:37:18] <patchy> $('ul#search > li > img') ?
[14:37:32] <jphase|working> that would be a very good/specific way to grab that yes
[14:37:44] <patchy> ahh..nice!
[14:37:47] <patchy> thanks :)

[14:40:21] <shoky> good, Rohan_Bhangui. sup
[14:41:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: just enjoyed a #jquery "knife fight" and have been working on jquery code
[14:41:18] <shoky> ohh who won
[14:42:01] <patchy> # is id....what is the code for class?
[14:42:38] <shoky> .
[14:42:43] <patchy> ahh
[14:42:46] <mitzev_> i have a list of links, when i click one link, it goes to a new url, but the user can also click more links while the page is loading
[14:42:59] <mitzev_> what is the best way to disable the other links after choosing one?
[14:48:06] <jphase|working> mitzev_: not sure why you'd want to do that, but I suppose you could grab the other links with the :not() selector and remove their href
[14:49:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: well its safe to say jphase won
[14:50:41] <newbeen> hello... i have a <a href="#homepage" data-role="button" data-icon="home" data-iconpos="right"> - is it possible to dynamically change the data-iconpos (based on screen width, say)?
[14:51:13] <newbeen> i can't seem to trigger a refresh of the style after changing the attribute with javascript...
[14:52:46] <jphase> newbeen: sure, you could use the resize event on the window for that
[14:53:17] <newbeen> jphase: ok, lemme look that up. thanks
[14:53:37] <jphase> np :)
[14:53:52] <newbeen> jphase: oh, sorry - screen width as in say mobile device versus tablet. so there's no resize event?
[14:54:19] <jphase> newbeen: oh okay
[14:54:20] <jphase> hmm
[14:54:24] <newbeen> i mean, i've tried .trigger('refresh'), 'updatelayout', etc - nothing seems to work
[14:54:29] <jphase> you could just grab the width on doc ready then
[14:54:41] <jphase> yeah some sort of event
[14:54:57] <_rgn> what is that data-whatever trying to do?
[14:55:53] <newbeen> jphase: i can successfully change that data-iconpos property on the <a>, and confirm that, but i don't know how to get the element to 'repaint' itself - it basically just renders what is in the original markup and ignores any dynamic updating of the value
[14:56:03] <_rgn> because
[14:56:08] <_rgn> the thing that is for probably only reads it once
[14:56:29] <aniasis> jphase, What would you suggest as a templating solution for rendering JSON?
[14:56:40] <jphase> ./ignore
[14:56:42] <newbeen> rgn: maybe it can be asked more generally: how to change the button styles depending on the device resolution?
[14:57:19] <_rgn> @media min-width or something
[14:57:25] <_rgn> with css
[14:58:02] <newbeen> rgn: ah, separate css resources! could try that approach i suppose...
[14:58:10] <_rgn> no not resources
[14:58:45] <aniasis> channel, what would anyone suggest as a templating solution that renders JSON?  My goto guy seems to be ignoring me.
[14:59:16] <newbeen> rgn: i mean deploy the app with multiple css files, and 'activate' the right on based on device resolution... ?
[14:59:31] <_rgn> no, not like that
[14:59:56] * newbeen offers aniasis a cup of tea
[15:00:18] <_rgn> http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#responsive
[15:00:36] <_rgn> it doesn't matter if you're using bootstrap or not, but that's the idea
[15:00:38] <newbeen> me?
[15:00:50] <aniasis> _rgn, cool that's what I am looking for
[15:01:54] <aniasis> _rgn, does Zurb provide a solution?
[15:06:25] <jphase> hmm, interesting how FF baked in mixed content blocking into their new version
[15:06:49] <jphase> making my current JSONP salesforce thing break without SSL :`[
[15:07:03] * jphase bills client for SSL and calls it a day :D
[15:07:16] <aniasis> Don't give up man
[15:07:34] <aniasis> jphase you can make it work sans SSL
[15:07:55] <jphase> no because this is for salesforce, which is on SSL
[15:08:06] <jphase> and they require it to work in newer versions of FF
[15:08:20] <jphase> so without SSL on the client's domain, content = no worky
[15:10:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[15:17:49] <patchy> how can i override the css file telling a div to be max 500px high?.. (greasemonkey)

[15:31:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but next time I open the dialog and click a link, it displays the text twice!
[15:31:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> then 3 times!

[15:31:54] <patchy> jphase: any idea? :)
[15:31:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how can it be?

[15:56:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> nvm, found the prob
[16:05:59] <ezakimak_work> if I call $.ajax(url1, { url: url2 }), which url takes precedence?
[16:06:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How do you make an OR operator in a selector? Eg. click on class1 or class2?
[16:07:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> ecky--ptang-zoob: very good question
[16:07:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> ecky--ptang-zoob: why not make a common class/id ebtween the two div,etc.

[16:08:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay...
[16:08:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> well what you could ahve done
[16:08:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> is give common class

[16:59:54] <jned> hi, how hard is it to take an rss weather feed, read it on a server, and serve it to client computers, and display it using jquery in html page?
[17:01:34] <doug65536> jned: there are several RSS feed reader plugins for jquery
[17:01:50] <doug65536> jned: google rss feed jquery
[17:02:08] <jned> doug65536, yeah, but what about relaying it?
[17:02:47] <doug65536> jned: relaying it to what
[17:03:47] <jned> doug65536, well see, I have a server that has internet connection, so it will access the weather feed from the internet, and then I need to have my client computers that are connected to the server, but not connected to the internet, to use a jquery plugin to display the rss feed
[17:04:36] <doug65536> jned: sorry but this sounds like nonsense. what program is going to be "listening" on the client computers
[17:06:28] <jned> doug65536, c'mon, what I mean is, its a private local area network without internet access, and I want to access an rss feed from the LAN, so first I would have to figure out how to setup the server, to read and rss feed and server it to the private lan
[17:06:42] <pixelpimp> just cache the weather feed locally and read from that RSS?
[17:07:12] <pixelpimp> I see no reason why it'd really matter with relaying... it's just the same thing a webserver would do normally
[17:07:22] <doug65536> jned: you can't write a proxy with jquery. try node.js
[17:07:25] <jned> so maybe setting up an rss server is not a jquery problem
[17:07:42] <pixelpimp> client accesses server, server requests RSS feed from another server, first server sends back results to client
[17:07:45] <jned> doug65536, or maybe ubuntu channel
[17:07:55] <jned> pixelpimp, yep
[17:08:08] <pixelpimp> assuming you can do something backend
[17:08:56] <jned> basically, a server that gets and rss feed, and others get that same rss feed from the server
[17:08:57] <doug65536> jned: think of it this way: how are you going to "push" the information into the clients? it doesn't make any sense. only a proxy that allows the clients to pull through a proxy really makes sense
[17:10:24] <jned> If we say an "rss server" is a server when you can read an rss feed, the what I am trying to do is setup and rss server from another rss server
[17:10:43] <jned> So not necessarily proxying, but reserving is just as well
[17:11:11] <doug65536> if all the clients had a webserver configured, then it would be possible to proxy like that - some "server" (which is really some computer running a browser with a page that does this - come on), pulls the rss and then posts it into the webservers on the clients. then what? how does the feed come up on their screen. it's nonsense
[17:11:51] <lindseyr> it's sorcery!
[17:11:58] <doug65536> a real approach would be to make a proxy with node.js
[17:12:37] <doug65536> the clients have rss feed readers running and they get the feed from your node.js proxy, which gets the feed and returns it
[17:13:38] <doug65536> or you could just skip writing the node proxy and just use a ready-to-go proxy
[17:13:44] <jned> my boss is a retard, he gets all ancy whenever I mention node.js, dunno what his problem is
[17:14:57] <doug65536> people who have no idea about server performance think that js is "slow" when really, what is slow as hell is the network I/O and disk I/O
[17:15:45] <jned> doug65536, no, he just an idiot
[17:16:03] <doug65536> c++ servers wait just as long as everybody else. they go flying into their I/O calls at light speed, then wait
[17:16:13] <jned> he loves his old IT guy, and want to keep all that stuff
[17:16:37] <jned> I like this nodejs stuff.  It is my fav platform
[17:17:05] <jned> I'm a newbie, but when I first discovered nodejs, I went crazy, I was reading for like 12hrs a day
[17:17:21] <pixelpimp> the feeling is not mutual.   i've heard talks of a restraining order
[17:17:43] <jned> pixelpimp, you don't like node.js you implying?
[17:17:56] <pixelpimp> lol no, node is bad ass
[17:18:10] <pixelpimp> was just making a joke about you going crazy over node.js
[17:19:10] <jned> pixelpimp, its friggin awesome eh, I didn't have so much fun on computer in years.  I read about the osi model ten years ago, but only learned it after Node
[17:21:26] <jned> I was like request, response, huh, what is that? Then I released, http request, http response, dunno why that wasn't immediately obvious to me, but it took me a while before I noticed that tidbid
[17:24:44] <rhizome> is there a list of default event types? click, resize, etc.? how can i know if there's one for "change" or if i should use .change()?

But I have no idea how to implement that.
[17:35:54] <scottstamp> This is what I came up with from their mailing list: http://pastie.org/8358810 but it doesn't seem to help. Note the "error..." function

[17:48:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: now to address the orphan case
[17:48:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: 20 frames?
[17:48:27] <Velveeta> yep, but i can't get in on that right now, i'm getting started on a new side project
[17:48:28] <i8igmac> iframes i guess
[17:48:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: hmmm
[17:48:55] <i8igmac> can i share my site as a example
[17:49:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: whts the side proj. if you dont mind me asking'
[17:49:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: that would be best
[17:49:36] <i8igmac> i dont have a domain at the moment
[17:49:59] <Velveeta> not gonna say anything just yet, but it shouldn't take me too long to hammer out, so maybe in the next few days

[17:51:32] <i8igmac> woops
[17:51:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> doug65536: hahah the cool kids
[17:51:49] <i8igmac> any ideas would be appreciated
[17:52:11] <i8igmac> i would like to see each from load as you scrole down to lighten the load time
[17:52:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: still loading lol
[17:52:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: why do you require iframes
[17:53:41] <i8igmac> this is my way of organizing things
[17:55:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: let me get this straight you are using iframes to section of data (ie data: name of movie, dvd cover, etc.)
[17:55:24] <i8igmac> yes
[17:55:48] <doug65536> i8igmac: what are you doing? I ran a waterfall analysis and you are hammering the GC
[17:56:06] <i8igmac> loading to many frames at one time
[17:56:26] <i8igmac> i would like to load 20 at a time and as you scrole down more should appear
[17:57:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: have you heard of something called a div
[17:58:36] <i8igmac> div id='sidebar'
[17:58:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay well use them than
[17:59:02] <doug65536> i8igmac: parsing the html is taking a ridiculous amount of time - oh wow, each thing is an iframe? that has ridiculous overhead
[17:59:23] <i8igmac> i had a feeling the iframe was a bad idea
[17:59:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: use divs instead of iframes
[17:59:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> why would you even consider iframes to begin with
[17:59:40] <doug65536> i8igmac: yeah, it'll fly with divs
[17:59:54] <i8igmac> it was something i used in the past

[18:08:47] <doug65536> has anyone experienced bootstrap buttons "missing" clicks? I could swear sometimes it ignores clicks
[18:09:20] <rhizome> i have, but i think it's a general js thing
[18:19:29] <__machine> is the error callback executed for 302 redirect responses to $.ajax() requests?
[18:20:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: how goes the iframe-div conversion
[18:20:54] <doug65536> __machine: it follows the redirect silently
[18:23:42] <__machine> doug65536: that's what i thought... i am doing a cross domain POST with $.ajax() and the remote server is returning a 302 redirect (which it is supposed to, on successful POST)... but the error callback in $.ajax() is being called... it just has "" for jqXHR.responseText and "error" for textStatus... errorThrown is also "" ... how can i figure out what the error is?
[18:24:37] <doug65536> __machine: cross domain ajax is blocked, unless the server says it is ok with an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header that allows it
[18:24:51] <__machine> doug65536: it does
[18:25:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: mind helping me with the orphan cases
[18:25:59] <__machine> the cross domain part seems to be working ok... when i submit my post with partial data i get the expected json response with errors that i can display with JS... but when i submit complete and accurate data... the backend server successfully processes it and returns a redirect... and jquery executes the error handler instead of the success handler...
[18:26:47] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: Of course not. Not sure how much help I'll be but I will always take a stab at it
[18:26:55] <doug65536> __machine: which browser?
[18:26:56] <jphase> you have a php example now yes?
[18:27:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: yes
[18:27:14] <__machine> doug65536: chrome 29
[18:27:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: i have js version as well

[18:27:57] <doug65536> __machine: you may need to refresh and cause it with the network pane already active though
[18:28:06] <jphase> pastebin.ws it to me (my friend's site that's much better than the .com). I'm fairly proficient in PHP but we should probably PM it so we're not rude in the jquery chan

[18:30:42] <Decalmo> hey guys, really new to jQuery here... I was wondering how I could make a certain DIV handle all of its links via AJAX back into that div... I know how to load a pre-defined link using ID's, but what if I want ANY link inside of that DIV to just load the content back into that DIV?
[18:30:46] <__machine> doug65536: no request shows up in the network tab at all... when i submit partial data, i see the POST request and i see the JSON response no problem... but when i submit complete data... the error handler fires and no request or response shows up in the network tab
[18:30:48] <Decalmo> here's an example of the code im using: http://paste.laravel.com/USK
[18:31:25] <doug65536> __machine: that indicates that it didn't even issue the request. what encoding is the POST?
[18:31:47] <__machine> doug65536: but my server is showing a 302 redirect response is being issued
[18:32:47] <__machine> if i submit complete but incorrect data that triggers a validation error at the backend i still get my JSON response back... but if the backend validates the data and issues a redirect... jquery fires the error handler and nothing shows up in the network tab
[18:33:20] <doug65536> __machine: you told jquery to expect a json response?
[18:33:56] <__machine> doug65536: yes... should i leave that to auto? it should give me json if there are validation errors... but redirect on success
[18:34:24] <doug65536> __machine: hmm, actually, where I'm going probably isn't right. it should be statusText=parseerror if there is a blank response. what response does the redirect emit?
[18:34:50] <doug65536> __machine: to be clear: what is the content of the redirect's url
[18:35:46] <doug65536> __machine: still, I doubt a request is happening with nothing in the network pane. you had the network pane already open before your code did the request?
[18:36:30] <__machine> the redirect target should also return json... the backend will return json if X-Requested-With header is XMLHttpRequest... which i am setting explicitly in my $.ajax() because jQuery wont set it automatically for CORS requests... maybe that is not being passed through when it follows the redirect?
[18:37:28] <doug65536> __machine: I'm pretty sure that happens at the native XMLHTTPRequest level, I doubt jquery has any say in how redirects happen
[18:38:03] <__machine> doug65536: yes, i have the network tab open... i cleared the network tab history and my console history... and cleared the backend log output... refreshed the whole page... submitted a request with partial data and verified that i got a json response with validation errors... then submitted again with complete data and i see the error handler fire, and i see a 302 response in backend log
[18:38:14] <doug65536> __machine: my guess would be, it passes that header to the redirect
[18:38:45] <__machine> doug65536: i see the 302 redirect response from backend server but i do not see a subsequent GET request for the target url of the redirect
[18:39:58] <doug65536> __machine: well, one way to force-test it is to craft an html page with a form that recreates your post, then submit it in a browser, and see what happens
[18:40:54] <__machine> a regular post, not ajax?
[18:41:34] <doug65536> __machine: what format is your post? urlencoded?
[18:42:01] <__machine> a non-ajax post with the same data redirects as expected...
[18:42:07] <doug65536> __machine: your post isn't json right? it's a "normal" post?
[18:42:40] <doug65536> __machine: ok, you can inspect it in the network pane and confirm that it does what you intended
[18:43:06] <__machine> yes... a normal post... i have $.ajax({data: form.serialize(), type: form.attr('method'), url: form.attr('action'), error: ..., success: ...})
[18:44:14] <doug65536> __machine: so you simulated that ajax with a form (as a test?). does the network pane for that request look right (expected headers etc)
[18:44:37] <__machine> doug65536: inspect the non-ajax post? how does that help? non-ajax works as expected... the backend server does the same processing... it just returns json if X-Requested-With header is set to XMLHttpRequest
[18:45:00] <doug65536> __machine: it helps because there is no CORS enforcement for a simulated ajax post
[18:45:11] <doug65536> __machine: you can confirm that the expected response headers are there
[18:45:12] <__machine> i also use $.ajaxPrefilter() to set options.headers = {'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'}; and options.xhrFields = {withCredentials: true};
[18:46:24] <__machine> all i did was disable the ajax and submit the regular post... so it doesnt send the X-Requested-With header... not sure how to send that header with a regular HTML post, or if i need to?
[18:46:27] <doug65536> __machine: credentials won't carry over to a redirect. are you specifying username: password: in the ajax call?
[18:47:11] <doug65536> __machine: well, at least, if the redirect is not to the same domain
[18:47:47] <__machine> doug65536: theres no username... i use withCredentials just so that the client can send and set a csrftoken cookie... which is only needed on the POST
[18:47:49] <i8igmac> Rohan_Bhangui: i have not had the chance yet ,-)
[18:47:58] <__machine> doug65536: yep, it redirected to the remote/target domain
[18:48:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: when you do
[18:51:42] <doug65536> __machine: try adding crossDomain: true to your ajax call
[18:52:13] <doug65536> __machine: jquery doc says "This allows, for example, server-side redirection to another domain"
[18:53:02] <__machine> doug65536: but isnt that talking about when forcing a cross domain style post to a local url... where the (local) server will then redirect to a remote domain? i am posting to a remote url to begin with...
[18:54:22] <__machine> doug65536: however i tried it anyway and no change in behaviour... im just about to run a trace on the backend server and view the redirect response more closely
[19:00:51] <__machine> doug65536: the response is definitely 302 with a correct Location header and also includes the required CORS headers... access-control-allow-origin and access-control-allow-credentials
[19:02:18] <doug65536> __machine: what about Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With, and, Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST. not sure that will make any difference though
[19:03:21] <coldhead> http headers are so tedious
[19:04:51] <doug65536> __machine: ah, I have an idea. in chrome, go to the sources tab, and click the little stop sign icon at the bottom until it is blue. that will make it stop at every exception
[19:05:08] <doug65536> __machine: jquery might be catching XHR exceptions
[19:05:31] <doug65536> __machine: jquery throws a few exceptions during startup though
[19:06:40] <doug65536> __machine: if you have the exact exception, it might allow better web searching for a solution
[19:07:44] <doug65536> __machine: I did see this bug (claimed to be fixed) whose title matches your issue https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57600
[19:07:59] <__machine> how do i know which exception to stop on and which to skip through? :)
[19:08:32] <__machine> first exception is window.JSON.parse(data) fails because data is ""
[19:08:49] <__machine> actually that seems to be the only error
[19:12:50] <__machine> the call stack is callback > done > ajaxConvert > jQuery.extend.parseJSON ...
[19:16:05] <__machine> why is it trying to convert the response instead of following the redirect... can i access the response object from the console somehow to inspect it?
[19:21:55] <coldhead> fourth wall
[19:25:34] <doug65536> __machine: I think that means it is refusing to follow the redirect. it is a cross domain ajax that redirects to a 3rd domain?
[19:25:53] <__machine> no, its the same remote domain
[19:26:48] <__machine> in that bug you linked there is this comment... "The previous patch incorrectly allows non-simple cross-origin requests to redirect (after the preflight)." ... does that mean following redirects for non-simple (preflighted) requests is not allowed?
[19:29:24] <doug65536> __machine: do you have firefox? what happens there?
[19:31:32] <__machine> trying now
[19:32:40] <doug65536> __machine: another relevant comment from one of the test devs in that bug: In the process, I noticed that there are tests (xmlhttprequest/redirect-xxx.html) that seem to expect CORS redirects to fail in cases where the spec says they should succeed
[19:36:40] <doug65536> __machine: that bug is pretty old but there's no reason to assume that they made any great improvements in regard to it
[19:37:02] <doug65536> __machine: trying it in firefox might narrow it to chrome misbehavior though
[19:38:36] <__machine> doug65536: hmm... firefox gives me different behaviour.. when i load the page i do an $.ajax() GET (withCredentials etc) so that the remote domain will set a csrftoken cookie... then subsequently i do my POST (which sends the same csrftoken cookie)... in firefox the GET doesnt even work... it also fires the error handler...
[19:41:21] <doug65536> __machine: go tools, web developer, network, cause the error there. does that show anything useful?
[19:42:52] <__machine> doug65536: jqXHR.statusText is [Exception... "A parameter or an operation is not supported by the underlying object"  code: "15" nsresult: "0x8053000f (InvalidAccessError)"  location: "http://localhost:8000/base.js Line: 8678"]
[19:46:54] <doug65536> __machine: are you getting tired of this problem? one way to force it is to proxy the requests through your server. have you considered that?
[19:47:20] <doug65536> __machine: I'm running out of ideas :)
[19:51:35] <__machine> doug65536: the idea here is to make our app (the remote domain) accessible by JS alone other domains... so we can deploy consumer promotions as simple html/js anywhere and have it communicate with our app... im sure redirects were working yesterday though... i must have done something to break it...
[19:52:50] <doug65536> __machine: the redirect is what's killing it right? did you try just doing a plain cross-domain ajax request that doesn't involve redirects, to ensure your CORS setup is correct?
[19:54:10] <__machine> doug65536: yeah, the request works fine if it doesnt return a redirect... depending on the data i include in the POST it will either redirect (on success) or return validation errors as JSON... the latter works as expected...
[19:55:22] <doug65536> __machine: do you provide them with a js api that abstracts your ajax? one workaround would be to implement the redirect "manually"
[19:57:14] <__machine> i might have to do that... but im pretty sure redirects were working and should work...
[20:41:08] <MrTrick_> Has anyone had issues with Apache returning 404 on OPTIONS requests? Because my server is on a different domain, the browser is performing an OPTIONS request first, but it's 404ing.
[20:44:14] <MrTrick_> Duh... user error. ;-)
[20:54:19] <i8igmac> Rohan_Bhangui: maybe some assistance ?
[20:54:41] <i8igmac> im trying to build the div lol
[20:55:04] <i8igmac> but i see errors highlight in red when i view the page source and im not sure why
[20:55:28] <i8igmac> http://71.212.19.190/500/movies/index.php?search_for_string=snitch
[20:55:34] <i8igmac> this will only load one frame
[21:16:58] <__machine> doug65536: back from lunch... firefox apparently doesnt like async: false for cors requests... once i removed that, i see exactly the same behaviour as chrome... except that firebug does show me a "302 FOUND" response in the network tab... chrome shows me nothing... the 302 response has the access-control and location headers... but jquery doesnt follow the redirect
[21:22:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> why are you still using frames
[21:22:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> just use divs only
[21:22:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> basically you need 2 divs
[21:22:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> both floating left and right
[21:22:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then inside the right floating div 2 more divs
[21:23:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: ^ read above
[21:25:09] <__machine> doug65536: this describes exactly the same problem i think... but doesnt really have an answer... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14531515/jquery-cors-and-redirects?rq=1
[21:31:29] <i8igmac> how can i stick src=description.html in side of div
[21:33:48] <thun_> http://pastebin.com/UgtVrGyk  <--- Is there a way to do this without the loop? Just grab the first instance of red_10game?
[21:34:50] <MrgooseLap> sup sup.  Is it possible to scroll a slide panel indepently?
[21:34:54] <MrgooseLap> independently
[21:35:08] <MrgooseLap> i have a slide panel that has a menu with a lot of items
[21:37:12] <i8igmac> Rohan_Bhangui: ok no more iframe, so here is my problem...

[21:37:26] <i8igmac> i cant get the background to take the correct shape

[21:38:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: i mean http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5803023/how-to-place-two-divs-next-to-each-other
[21:39:36] <i8igmac> OH, thats nice
[21:41:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: which link
[21:41:55] <i8igmac> the exmaple use of wrapper, first, second...
[21:42:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[21:42:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> just amking sure
[21:42:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> *making
[21:44:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: that stuff should solve issue and then isde the right div you an vertically split to suit your needs
[21:59:07] <raj> instead of sorting using `arr`, how can I sort the <p>'s using their `data-profile-job` attribute according to the same sort criteria? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/EGygs/5/
[22:14:47] <raj> must be thirsty thursday
[22:45:36] <jphase> <3 you long time jquery friends
[22:45:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: its 2 in the morning here ofcourse its thirsty thursday
[22:55:37] <tw2113> isn't friday?
[23:00:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> still
[23:01:27] <Hereisanotherlie> it's thursday in the places that matter
[23:09:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[23:11:35] <tw2113> trying to think of where it'd still be thursday at 2am
[23:11:55] <tw2113> australia is already into friday afternoon
[23:12:06] <Hereisanotherlie> its 11pm here :P
[23:12:30] <tw2113> Rohan_Bhangui, was the case i was referring to
[23:14:51] <__machine> is it possible to add a global `success` handler for all $.ajax() calls that will fire *before* any success handlers added directly to a particular $.ajax() call?
[23:15:24] <Cork> __machine: test the event
[23:15:35] <Cork> (not sure if it fires first though)
[23:16:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> try canada
[23:16:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> close to new york
[23:18:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: how do you bold text
[23:18:32] <tw2113> it's most definitely 2am friday then
[23:21:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[23:26:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: you got it
[23:31:45] <raj> instead of sorting using `arr`, how can I sort the <p>'s using their `data-profile-job` attribute according to the same sort criteria? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/EGygs/5/
[23:33:48] <raj> how can I do this?
[23:38:41] <_rgn> why do you need to sort arr instead of getting the values from the data-attributes
[23:39:01] <raj> :) I wanna do exactly the opposite
[23:39:07] <raj> I want to use the data-attributes instead of arr
[23:40:04] <doug65536> raj: almost have an example done
[23:41:15] <raj> doug65536, can you just build off the example I had?
[23:41:29] <doug65536> raj: yes
[23:41:32] <raj> you can delete `arr` once the .sort is applied to moving the actual DOM
[23:41:39] <raj> ah ok, thank you :)
[23:45:51] <doug65536> raj: does this work like you expect?

[23:49:19] <__machine> any cors gurus around? i am having this problem http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14531515/jquery-cors-and-redirects and there doesn't seem to be an answer there... chrome and firefox just stop processing 302 responses to CORS requests with credentials...?
[23:52:54] <raj> doug65536, first sort by `current`, (if current is true, ignore end-date), otherwise sort by end-date, and then start-date last
[23:54:59] <raj> doug65536, very clever
[23:55:55] <raj> doug65536, can I separate the append and element sorting?
[23:56:01] <raj> so it doesn't look as tedious
[23:56:07] <doug65536> raj: yes
[23:56:13] <raj> ...to abstract a bit more
[23:59:35] <doug65536> raj: here's a more compact way to do a multi-level sort http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/EGygs/15/
[23:59:36] <raj> doug65536, also, is the detachment necessary?
