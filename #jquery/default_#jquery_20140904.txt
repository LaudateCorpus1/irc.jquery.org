[00:39:35] <g33kyboi> hello
[00:41:26] <g33kyboi> am working on a project and i need to display pictures and some texts like it is shown in magazines... can someone help with any jquery api that can help. thanks
[01:42:09] <gnu_d> Hi, why the validator isn't showing the errors, the $(".error") is containing the errors, but they're not visible in the form ?
[01:55:58] <ggdevelop> hi, can I show toggle div in bootstrap modal?
[01:58:13] <ggdevelop> I mean that if I have a toggle div in bootstrap modal, how can the modal hight can grow dinemcly with the div size , when it open..?
[01:59:46] <slax0r> ggdevelop: if height is set, it wont
[01:59:55] <slax0r> dunno bootstrap, but if you can, use min-height
[02:00:00] <slax0r> then it will be minimum of the set
[02:00:09] <slax0r> and if your toggled div exceeds that, the modal should "grow"
[02:03:01] <Cork> though not that the animation timing will be based on the min-height, not the actual height
[02:03:38] <Cork> uh you mean max-height right?
[02:08:07] <elmcrest> Hi everyone. Is there a best practice how to handle german numbers/currency correctly with js/jquery? ... I've fount a lot with f.e. replace(Regex) - but I am wondering if there's a cleaner solution
[02:12:39] <Cork> slax0r: http://jsfiddle.net/xxunpdsr/ an example of why max-height is normally not an option
[02:13:29] <slax0r> Cork: I said min
[02:14:08] <slax0r> like I said, I don't know bootstrap
[02:14:24] <Cork> slax0r: you can't really animate to unknown height with min-height
[02:14:34] <Cork> and if you know the height, just use height
[02:14:52] <RusAlex> q: there is no way to do $el.attr('class', <array>) ?
[02:14:52] <Cork> (the green area)
[02:15:07] <Cork> RusAlex: array.join(' ')
[02:15:18] <Cork> RusAlex: also use .addClass not attr
[02:15:27] <slax0r> Cork: yeah, like I said, don't know bootstrap, didn't know they were animated :)
[02:15:41] <slax0r> and less animations === better, at least for me
[02:15:49] <Cork> well true
[02:16:01] <Cork> i kinda assumed it was about animations...
[02:16:12] <Cork> but i just realized... it was never out spoken :x
[02:16:39] <Cork> but ya, it is normally max-height you want not min
[02:19:22] <RusAlex> Cork: why do not use attr('class'?
[02:19:41] <Cork> RusAlex: cause you will reset the classes on the element
[02:19:56] <Cork> meaning you have to know about everything going on in the page
[02:20:04] <Cork> if some other script needs to add a class to the element
[02:20:05] <RusAlex> it's what I need
[02:20:15] <Cork> you have to know about it so you can add it back again
[02:20:18] <Cork> RusAlex: why?
[02:20:29] <Cork> just handle the classes you deal with
[02:20:35] <Cork> then it can be extended
[02:20:55] <Cork> (without this code having to be modified)
[02:21:32] <RusAlex> ok
[02:23:34] <Cork> RusAlex: so one does .removeClass('classes you might add that you need to be sure should be removed')
[02:23:44] <Cork> and to add just addClass('the classes to add')
[02:23:52] <Cork> jquery will handle the rest
[02:25:49] <tippi> Hello
[02:26:04] <prathap> Hello all, I am a newbie to jQuery. Started today. I wanted to implement the http://www.2meter3.de/jqPuzzle/ Jquery puzzle plugin. But unfortunately, only the image loads, it is not becoming the puzzle. Any help will be greatly appreciated
[02:26:11] <tippi> I have a question jQuery UI 1.10 for the tabs widget
[02:26:18] <prathap> https://www.typeitout.com/puzzle.html
[02:26:41] <tippi> I need to update a single tab content on action done in an other tab
[02:26:57] <tippi> What will you recommend to use?
[02:29:14] <tippi> prathap ... In simply have a look at the js console for your web page... I have a syntax error : unexpeted < token
[02:31:29] <tippi> help
[02:33:16] <prathap> tippi : thanks for that, but do you have the line number? I just took the source from the original website and was not expecting that it will have an error. And I am a newbie, I can't seem to find the error from firebug
[02:33:59] <tippi> pratham : no it seems to be in a ressource file
[02:34:30] <tippi> I suggest first to remove one by one and see which makes the error
[02:35:50] <prathap> Are you sure you looked at https://www.typeitout.com/puzzle.html ? There are only three resources - jquery, jquery.jqpuzzle.js and jquery.jqpuzzle.css
[02:43:09] <prathap> @tippi it does not seem to work
[02:44:22] <tippi> :-(
[02:45:22] <Tomashe1> var apiComments = {}; var tempVal = value.sub; apiComments.tempVal[] = value;
[02:45:28] <Tomashe1> why this isnt wroking form e?
[02:46:02] <prathap> tippi : Thanks, I solved it. I was using a wrong jquery version, and I referenced to the wrong file
[02:46:19] <tippi> ok
[02:46:27] <tippi> good for you
[02:49:23] <Tomashe1> ?
[02:50:56] <manus> Hello again, jQuerians. Asked a question yesterday but got no answer, so asking again: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20140903.log.html#t09:38:06
[02:51:33] <manus> recap: is there a way to use jQuery UI draggable to that it doesn't interfere with touch scrolling?
[02:51:39] <manus> *so that
[03:00:00] <prathap> Anyone has any idea why is this jquery slider puzzle not working the way it was supposed to work? The images are not sliding and the buttons look broken
[03:00:05] <prathap> https://www.typeitout.com/puzzle.html
[03:03:34] <MacroMan> How can I use .is(':hover') in an if statement?
[03:08:29] <MacroMan> Oh never mind, it seems :hover is depreciated which is why it doesn't work.
[03:09:00] <frank_o> MacroMan: I always add a hover class to the element *shrugs*
[03:24:57] <workerbeetwo> jquery does not react on certain elements. like  #('.olPopupCloseBox').click(...);  Firebugs shows the elements greyed out. openlayers added the elements on runtime.
[03:44:10] <droid909> i have an array of objects, each object has and id value how do i sort my objects according to id values?
[03:48:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> dir
[03:48:09] <xec> droid909: almost the same way you would sort an array of numbers, i suppose: array.sort(function(a,b){ /* compare a.id to b.id here */ })
[03:48:47] <xec> droid909:  see "Objects can be sorted given the value of one of their properties" at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[03:49:29] <decx> return a.id - b.id
[03:49:30] <droid909> xec: ohh, that is cool
[03:50:35] <droid909> xec: thanks
[03:51:23] <xec> np :) also see what decx wrote, simplest way to compare two numbers
[04:43:00] <tlkshadow> Hi, i have a question about calling functions within a jquery plugin. I want to set via the option a function before() with suff i want to do before the main part of the plugin. But i have tried several things and all ways didn't work.. Can someone please help me. e.g. http://pastebin.com/8rq9Rc0G
[04:58:03] <wolfehr> is there a mechanism to bind to an event, which will override any previous bindings? e.g if I do $(document).on(‘click’,’#item’, function(){ }); several times, only one click will occur? I’ve tried using stopImmediatePropagation, but this actually seems to prevent it from handling the event again
[05:00:35] <tlkshadow> try .once() insted of on()
[05:03:37] <wolfehr> tlkshadow, is once() in core?
[05:04:06] <tlkshadow> oh sry i mean one ()  http://api.jquery.com/one/
[05:04:40] <sacho> wolfehr, why are you doing this several times?
[05:05:59] <wolfehr> status change in an applicaton loading fragments. when a fragment is loaded, an assocaited setup method is fired, which sets up the event handlers and other things
[05:07:08] <wolfehr> it could be refactored so all of the handlers are triggered on startup, but at the moment, they’re not
[05:07:18] <wolfehr> I’ll just off() before the on(), seems to be the quickest solution

[05:15:11] <Cork> tlkshadow: line 2 isn't possible
[05:15:17] <Cork> you can't do it like that
[05:16:37] <Cork> tlkshadow: you need to move that part down to after the function declaration
[05:16:46] <Cork> and $.extend options with the default values you want
[05:17:13] <Cork> right now you define a function that tries to be an object (you should get parser errors)
[05:17:59] <tlkshadow> ah okay
[05:18:39] <tlkshadow> i deleted to much :D whait
[05:18:41] <tlkshadow> -h
[05:18:45] <Cork> tlkshadow: http://jsfiddle.net/df2m2k81/
[05:18:50] <Cork> something like this
[05:19:18] <Cork> opps
[05:19:23] <tlkshadow> http://pastebin.com/YG88vy9a
[05:19:25] <Cork> line 18 should be removed
[05:19:30] <Cork> please use jsfiddle
[05:19:34] <tlkshadow> ok
[05:19:38] <Cork> pastebin is horridble to colaborate in
[05:19:48] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/df2m2k81/1/
[05:20:00] <tlkshadow> http://jsfiddle.net/6hjk48uu/
[05:20:21] <Cork> tlkshadow: return this; in an each loop is pointless
[05:20:45] <Cork> so http://jsfiddle.net/df2m2k81/2/
[05:20:51] <tlkshadow> okay removed it
[05:21:10] <tlkshadow>  but how i can trigger the functions in the each look?
[05:21:12] <tlkshadow> loop
[05:25:27] <tlkshadow> i tried settings.after.apply( this, Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 ));
[05:25:39] <tlkshadow> but it is not working
[05:26:20] <tlkshadow> ah thanks i diddnt saw that you wrote something
[05:32:45] <tlkshadow> WORKS! thanks alot
[05:51:38] <Aswebb_> is there a jquery plugin to create a "falling down" effect on HTML elements?
[05:52:08] <Aswebb_> An "effect" caused by an earthquake, where all HTML elements fall down from top to bottom
[05:53:06] <decx> google js 2d physics
[05:53:47] <Aswebb_> thanks decx, gonna take a look
[05:54:16] <rgman> Yeap, http://code.google.com/p/box2d-html5/.
[05:54:27] <rgman> But it's not a jquery plugin.
[05:55:21] <rgman> It's a physics engine.
[05:56:01] <Nomikos> $('*').animate() ?
[05:56:28] <decx> but that's an old flash port i doubt box2d still can compete with a js physics engine from scratch nowadays
[05:57:37] <Aswebb_> Nomikos: That would work
[05:57:51] <Aswebb_> Nomikos: Gonna check if there is an example how to animate from top to bottom
[05:57:57] <Aswebb_> to create a "falling down" effect
[06:14:08] <mccar> Hi!
[06:14:31] <mccar> Can anybody help with a little issue?
[06:16:04] <mccar> I need to write code that will submit a form
[06:16:44] <mccar> Sure it is extremely easy for you, but I'm stuck
[06:17:30] <mccar> I have a form with some elements and to buttons "submit" and "clear"
[06:18:20] <BillCriswell> mccar: You would want to do $('.class-name-on-form').trigger('submit');
[06:18:25] <rgman> mccar: $('form').submit() ?
[06:18:35] <BillCriswell> or any type of selector to get the form.
[06:18:39] <mccar> first one should submit form and send form's values to script by ajax, and "clear" must clear form
[06:18:58] <mccar> Thank you for your reply
[06:19:46] <rgman> mccar: You should have a look at $.ajax() http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[06:20:01] <BillCriswell> mccar: It doesn't sound like you want to submit the form programmatically. It sounds like you want to use ajax when it's submitted.
[06:20:08] <mccar> I have code for submit like $( "#add_user_form" ).submit(function( event ) { event.preventDefault(); and so on
[06:20:31] <mccar> ajax works well
[06:21:14] <mccar> Issue is that form submitted whether I click "submit" or "clear"
[06:21:55] <BillCriswell> You actually want to clear out all form elements or do the standard browser reset of the forms?
[06:22:12] <jop008> This code http://jsfiddle.net/RB9Qw/48/ generates this in my browser http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-09-04_at_15.18.28-lxtB0hyw.png
[06:22:12] <rgman> mccar: Ok. So what do you need? To send the form asynchronously when the submit button is clicked?
[06:22:23] <mccar> I think standard reset is suitable
[06:22:49] <jop008> So to much space in relation to the other fieldcontain fields
[06:23:11] <BillCriswell> mccar: Is the reset button type="reset" ?
[06:23:49] <mccar> No, it's <button>
[06:24:10] <BillCriswell> mccar: Do <input type="reset"> and that won't trigger the submit event.
[06:24:27] <BillCriswell> mccar: http://jsbin.com/yitopasumiso/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:24:30] <mccar> Great!!!
[06:24:38] <mccar> Thank you!!!
[06:25:20] <BillCriswell> If you need it to be a button you'll have to detect which button was clicked and act accordingly.
[06:25:23] <rgman> mccar: You can use type="reset" with the button element too. http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_button_type.asp
[06:25:33] <mccar> I spent about 3 hours to make it programmatically
[06:25:41] <BillCriswell> rgman: Oh sweet.
[06:26:06] <BillCriswell> Disregard the last thing I said mccar. <button type="reset">Reset</button> will work as well.
[06:26:20] <mccar> I'm interesting also how to detect which button was pressed?
[06:26:34] <BillCriswell> mccar: The only way I know it through a bit of a hack.
[06:26:57] <BillCriswell> When I have to do this I do var $buttonClicked = $(document.activeElement);
[06:28:23] <mccar> Thank you!
[06:28:41] <astRocre1p> wouldn't the button be in 'this' ?
[06:28:55] <BillCriswell> astRocre1p: It would be the form.
[06:29:13] <nezZario> sorry, ok, I didn't see the whole question
[06:30:15] <mccar> But is still not clear for me why I didn't find button's value using $("#form_name").find("input[type='button_name']").val()
[06:30:49] <BillCriswell> mccar: I think you want name='button_name'
[06:31:03] <mccar> sure, sorry
[06:31:10] <BillCriswell> type would only be something reset, submit, or button ( I think? )
[06:31:54] <mccar> I did a mistake, I mean "input[name='button_name']"
[06:32:25] <BillCriswell> mccar: Meaning you just mistyped and the correct thing isn't working/
[06:33:08] <mccar> No, I didn't
[06:33:20] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[06:33:55] <mccar> It's not work   alert( $form.find("input[name='cancelButton']").val() );
[06:34:20] <mccar> var $form = $( this );
[06:35:00] <BillCriswell> Do you have <input name="cancelButton" value="Cancel"> inside $form?
[06:35:01] <mccar> lines order correct in my code
[06:35:14] <mccar> yes
[06:35:31] <rgman> mccar: What does it shows? Undefined?
[06:36:15] <mccar> Yes, always undefined. It's driving me mad :)
[06:36:35] <rgman> Try using console.log if it possible. You'll get a better description of what's being returned.
[06:36:45] <rgman> console.log($form);
[06:36:58] <rgman> console.log($form.find(...))
[06:37:18] <BillCriswell> mccar: http://jsbin.com/yitopasumiso/2/edit?html,js,output works fine here (When you click Save).
[06:40:19] <mccar> But I get 'undefined' in console while running my code
[06:41:24] <BillCriswell> Then you're doing something weird haha
[06:42:57] <rgman> BillCriswell: I've had weird errors with the .find function. Had to use children instead.
[06:43:44] <BillCriswell> rgman: I can't think of a situation where that would happen. Do you have an example of that happening?
[06:44:26] <BillCriswell> I can understand the mixup when needing to use .filter() vs .find() but never seen .find() vs .children() cause issues.
[06:46:37] <rgman> BillCriswell: Noup, sorry. I was working on an old webpage. The client wanted to improve it. And man it was a mess.
[06:47:03] <rgman> It still haunts me at night..
[06:47:39] <BillCriswell> Haha understood.
[06:52:54] <jop008> anyone a sample with ui-field-contain with an unordered lists?
[06:53:01] <jop008> Cant't find one
[06:56:17] <jop008> all examples are without a field contain http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/docs/lists/docs-lists.html
[07:03:08] <mccar> BillCriswell: I checked your link, thank you. But why log apperas when I ckick "save" instead of "Cancel"?
[07:04:05] <BillCriswell> mccar: I put type="button" on Cancel because it didn't want it to trigger the submit event.
[07:05:12] <mccar> I see, thank you!
[07:05:54] <JustMozzy> hey everyone. I am struggling with iPads. When I have the focus on an input field and change the display orientation, I would get wrong values for document.width and document.height. Anyone knows how I can get the correct values?
[07:06:13] <jop008> when I add this to the ul tag style="position:relative;left:-20%;" the positioning is better
[07:06:23] <jop008> but a nice solution?
[07:36:14] <Jagst3r21> any idea how i can get the viewport to auto-calculate here? http://b4bpod.staging.wpengine.com/
[07:36:17] <Jagst3r21> on the slider
[07:36:46] <Jagst3r21> im using jQuery cycle
[07:41:05] <mccar> BillCriswell: Can you, please, view my code. Its pretty simple but do not work.. http://jsbin.com/yitopasumiso/3/edit
[07:41:09] <marmarmar> I've succeeded in prepending a div to the datepicker div, by using click. Now I have a different problem, where every time I click on the input that brings about the datepicker, the div I wanted to prepend is prepended again.
[07:41:45] <marmarmar> Can someone point me in the right direction for what I might want to  use in place of click ?
[07:42:27] <BillCriswell> mccar: What doesn't work?
[07:43:01] <mccar> When I click on "Send" I get 'undefined'
[07:43:30] <BillCriswell> Отправить === send?
[07:44:21] <mccar> Yes
[07:44:38] <hirsty> Hey all what is the best way to check if each of an array of selectors has been changed?
[07:45:09] <hirsty> trying $("select[name='x[]']").each(function() { with $(this).change and having no luck
[07:46:03] <Jagst3r21> anyone? :(
[07:46:12] <BillCriswell> hirsty: You can just do $('select[name="x[]"]').on('change', function () { });
[07:46:35] <hirsty> ah right, will try that - ty  :3
[07:47:40] <Jagst3r21> I think it has something to do with containerResize: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html
[07:47:56] <Jagst3r21> the question is then, is there any workaround for this?
[07:49:04] <BillCriswell> mccar: Buttons don't get values apparently.
[07:49:54] <BillCriswell> Wiat.. doesn't sound right.
[07:50:44] <hirsty> Hmm...doesnt seem to be working >.> sec lemme get you a fiddle
[07:51:06] <mccar> BillCriswell: You can wipe all code about ajax
[07:51:58] <BillCriswell> mccar: Duh.
[07:52:21] <BillCriswell> You want a button element, not an input element.
[07:52:27] <BillCriswell> Not sure how I missed that for so long.
[07:52:52] <BillCriswell> mccar: http://jsbin.com/yitopasumiso/3/edit?html,js,output
[07:54:03] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: Do you just want the slideshow to be 100% width?
[07:54:15] <AdamPDotty> height, I guess
[07:54:37] <AdamPDotty> why does the div-wrapper have any height at all?
[07:54:53] <mccar> BillCriswell: My stupid mistake...
[07:55:47] <AdamPDotty> bah, do not blame it on the mistake
[07:56:05] <BillCriswell> What else would you blame it on? lol
[07:58:07] <decx> minorities!
[07:58:10] <mccar> Great thank you!
[07:58:51] <BillCriswell> YOUTHS
[08:03:28] <hirsty> doesnt seem to be working :/ - got php specifying indexes
[08:04:23] <Jagst3r21> BillCriswell it is something to do with containerResize: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html I think :/
[08:13:57] <hirsty> @BillCriswell that should work even if array items are specified shouldnt it?
[08:43:15] <jop008> why is my list item not styled nicely ? http://jsfiddle.net/RB9Qw/50/
[08:47:30] <nonconvergent> Reading someone elses jquery, they used the https://api.jquery.com/on/ function with "change" as the event -> $('#addressModal').on("change", "#county", function(){.....});
[08:47:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[08:48:24] <nonconvergent> Does that function get executed when #county is changed or #addressModal is changed?
[08:48:50] <robertmaxrees> that binds a delegated listener to #addressModal that listens for when #county changes
[08:49:02] <nonconvergent> oh, okay, thanks.
[08:49:02] <robertmaxrees> you usually do that when you have a child that gets added after the page loads.
[08:50:29] <robertmaxrees> check out the direct vs. delegated events section in the docs for .on() :)
[08:52:01] <nonconvergent> Okay, so if I want a function to run (say one that validate and updates fields) in reponse to a change to another field being changed, would that be the thing to use?
[08:52:28] <robertmaxrees> is it the same function or a different function to the one above
[08:52:28] <robertmaxrees> ?
[08:53:00] <robertmaxrees> and is the other field also a descendent of #addressModal ?
[08:53:28] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: any function, and yes it is a descendent.
[08:53:45] <robertmaxrees> will that element exist on pageload?
[08:54:03] <robertmaxrees> if not, you can use the same syntax as above, just sawp out that second arg to .on() for your new element's selector.
[08:55:49] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: #addressModal doesn't even exist on pageload.
[08:56:06] <nonconvergent> but they will both exist when #addressModal does.
[08:56:08] <robertmaxrees> that binding is probably running after it gets added.
[08:56:26] <robertmaxrees> that syntax of .on() doesn't really make sense in cases like that.
[08:56:58] <jop008> why is my list item not styled nicely ? http://jsfiddle.net/RB9Qw/50/
[08:57:03] <nonconvergent> Is there a list of what events mean? I've seen "click", "blur change" and "change" so far.
[08:59:16] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent click, blur, and change are three.
[08:59:27] <robertmaxrees> you can bind to multiples at the same time, like 'blur change' is for both.
[08:59:32] <robertmaxrees> there should be a list on MDN
[09:00:31] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
[09:01:46] <robertmaxrees> jop008 did you look at your console?
[09:02:09] <jop008> I am now here http://jsfiddle.net/RB9Qw/53/
[09:02:38] <robertmaxrees> btw <- http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/RB9Qw/54/
[09:02:47] <robertmaxrees> this has jquery mobile included through jsfiddle's setup.
[09:04:59] <jop008> So you have to style the li items yourseff
[09:05:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[09:05:41] <robertmaxrees> your markup isn't valid btw
[09:06:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/RB9Qw/55/
[09:06:26] <robertmaxrees> you can only place the <li> element as a descendent of a <ul> or <ol>
[09:06:37] <robertmaxrees> nest your stuff properly and it'll work.
[09:17:01] <jop008> the problem was the li was outside <ul tag
[09:17:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:17:08] <robertmaxrees> i just said that.
[09:39:59] <sportman> is there an alternative to using hashchange?
[09:40:11] <sportman> for instnace i would rather use on get change
[09:40:25] <sportman> so if i changed to ?subpage=files or ?subpage=news
[09:40:30] <sportman> or do i have to use #
[11:31:30] <Absolute0> I have the following selector: $("[name*='date']"). How can I make it match "date" OR "as_of"? Do I have to add a comma?
[11:34:05] <ngharo> yes or tag both elements with a classname
[11:35:17] <systemfault> Absolute0: The same way as in CSS... 2 selectors separated by a comma
[11:38:44] <Absolute0> I was hoping to use regexp
[11:38:50] <Absolute0> isn't *= regexp?
[11:39:07] <BillCriswell> You probably don't want to use regex.
[11:40:41] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: You can do $('el').filter(function() { return ['date', 'as_if'].indexOf(this.name) > -1; });
[11:41:22] <BillCriswell> Since [name=data],[name=as_of] I imagine would go through EVERY element twice. Should at least narrow it down to a tag name (el).
[11:42:15] <BillCriswell> $.inArray(this.name, ['date', 'as_of']) > -1; if you need to support old IE.
[11:42:20] <robertMeeting> combining an attribute selector with regex is going to be waaaaay slow.
[11:44:02] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-prefix-selector/ shocked this exists haah
[11:44:14] <robertMeeting> yeah....
[11:47:41] <Absolute0> is :input[name=...] much faster than [name=...]?
[11:48:12] <robertMeeting> somewhat.  input[name=...] would be faster.
[11:48:28] <BillCriswell> :input would have to look for textarea,select,input etc as well.
[11:48:35] <BillCriswell> If you just want input elements drop the colon.
[11:48:41] <robertMeeting> doing $('input').find(''). is even better.
[11:48:53] <Absolute0> why?
[11:49:01] <robertMeeting> rather .filter() or similar methods.
[11:49:12] <robertMeeting> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[11:49:14] <robertMeeting> this explains it.
[11:49:21] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: Just said why haha.
[11:49:30] <BillCriswell> ":input would have to look for textarea,select,input etc as well."
[11:50:05] <robertMeeting> also: http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[11:50:17] <robertMeeting> :input can't use queryselectorall, so it's slow.
[11:50:36] <Absolute0> BillCriswell: sorry I was assking robertMeeting's recommendation of .find()
[11:50:46] <robertMeeting> i meant .filter()
[11:50:55] <BillCriswell> Oh, lol.
[11:50:56] <robertMeeting> instead of .find - find is for descendant elements
[11:51:09] <BillCriswell> Yeah he brainfarted.
[11:51:20] <robertMeeting> happens a lot haha
[11:51:42] <robertMeeting> but starting with a specific subset first and going them there is generally preferred.  the selector optimizations page I linked will tell you more.
[11:51:48] <Absolute0> lol, haha, where's the sand box?
[11:51:49] <BillCriswell> I kind of want to try and build  input[name||="foo,bar"] selector thing for fun.
[11:52:03] <robertMeeting> what sandbox?
[11:59:21] <BillCriswell> robertMeeting: Do you know how to extend attribute selectors?
[11:59:28] <BillCriswell> Googling this is a bitch.
[12:00:29] <robertMeeting> $.extend($.expr[':'],{}) iirc
[12:00:33] <robertMeeting> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/extending-jquerys-selector-capabilities/
[12:00:35] <BillCriswell> I could do like input:name(foo,bar) but I think something like input[name||=foo,bar]
[12:00:40] <robertMeeting> dunno how you'd do a specific one.
[12:00:54] <BillCriswell> robertMeeting: Yeah. I was more interested in doing it through the [] and not :
[12:00:59] <robertMeeting> aaaah
[12:01:44] <BillCriswell> These has to be a way since jQuery is doing it, just no good at finding it haha
[12:02:36] <robertMeeting> it might be inside of sizzle? i can't remember
[12:12:19] <marmarmar> Has anyone here used Chosen wth the datepicker ?
[12:39:16] <fr4nk> anyone familar with plugin dev? why to put the default-options inside the $.fn.myplugin declaration (as in the example in learning center), can i place them outside (but inside the IIFE) too? pros/cons?
[12:40:04] <systemfault> Can't see any pros nor cons
[12:40:10] <systemfault> (my opinion)
[12:42:37] <fr4nk> hm ok, so every plugin instance has anyway its own defaults? because of the IIEF Scope? (multiple instances on same page)
[13:06:56] <benlieb> is there a way to access a native dom method more explicitly this: $('audio#player')[0].play();
[13:07:18] <benlieb> by explicitly I mean something like $('audio#player').the_native_element().play();
[13:07:54] <systemfault> benlieb: Not really... You could use $('#player').get(0).play(); instead but it's the same.
[13:09:08] <benlieb> systemfault: yeah, not really better but oh well. the more I program the more I love explicit code.
[13:09:53] <benlieb> I wonder why jquery obscures going native with a strange array access approach.
[13:10:25] <NoiseEee> benlieb: because most people want to use jQuery methods after using a jQuery selector.
[13:10:27] <benlieb> I'm probably missing something obvious
[13:10:39] <benlieb> NoiseEee: i undestand that
[13:17:28] <pootpoot> Hello. How do i select ONLY $('.items') that also have class a, b, or c?
[13:17:42] <pootpoot> others with classes d, e, f are ignored
[13:18:59] <BillCriswell> pootpoot: You can use filter.
[13:19:29] <pootpoot> ah, i keep forgetting about filter thanks
[13:19:46] <BillCriswell> $('.items').filter(function(){ return $(this).is('.a,.b,.c'); }); maybe?
[13:19:56] <BillCriswell> I feel like I'm doing something stupid.
[13:20:00] <BillCriswell> It is 4:19.
[13:20:38] <pootpoot> .filter('.a,.b,.c') works too :)
[13:20:52] <pootpoot> horray for jquery
[13:24:07] <benlieb> is there a way to inspect an elements event handlers?
[13:25:58] <benlieb> or another way to put it
[13:26:17] <benlieb> how can I tell if an element already has a handler bound to it via bind()?
[13:26:48] <benlieb> there's un unbind() method, so presumably there is a record kept somewhere...
[13:27:39] <benlieb> basically I'm looking for a $(el).is_bound('event', func)
[13:28:20] <marc_v92> benlieb: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1236067/test-if-event-handler-is-bound-to-an-element-in-jquery
[13:32:45] <benlieb> marc_v92: tnx for that link. I searched before but didn't use the magic word unbind
[13:33:00] <benlieb> marc_v92: unfortunately this is the recommended solution: So, you should unbind/rebind it or simply, use a boolean to determine if your event as been attached or not (which is in my opinion the best solution).
[13:33:16] <benlieb> so I keep track my self or unbind/rebind.
[13:34:31] <marc_v92> benlieb: $._data(element, "events") won’t do what your looking for?
[13:34:48] <benlieb> marc_v92: $(element).data(“events”): This is now removed in 1.8, but you can still get to the events data for debugging purposes via $._data(element, "events"). Note that this is not a supported public interface; the actual data structures may change incompatibly from version to version.
[13:36:29] <marc_v92> benlieb: Hmm, alright. Yeah, in that case it doesn’t look like there’s much choice.
[13:41:59] <benlieb> is there a way to register a callback that is performed after all ajax calls?
[13:42:40] <benlieb> this may be it http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[13:48:53] <NoiseEee> indeed benlieb
[13:49:18] <robertMeeting> there's also the .done() callback
[13:49:36] <benlieb> tnx
[13:50:18] <benlieb> how do I use event delegation when I don't control the event binding?
[13:50:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:50:26] <benlieb> for example bootstraps $(el).tooltip() method
[13:50:33] <benlieb> attaches a click handler internally
[13:50:37] <benlieb> I mean hover
[13:50:58] <benlieb> If I wrap this in a (doc).ready()
[13:51:13] <benlieb> then it only woks for elements loaded initially, no new elements
[13:51:38] <robertmaxrees> what event are you listening for?
[13:51:57] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: I don't do the listening, it's a bootstrap method
[13:52:08] <robertmaxrees> then you can't bind a delegated listener.
[13:52:26] <benlieb> $(el).tooltip() assigns a listener for the object internally to bootstrap
[13:52:54] <robertmaxrees> you can't delegate that.
[13:53:31] <robertmaxrees> iirc there's a js api you could use to control those instead.
[13:53:41] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: so how would i make sure that new elements get that called? Right now my solution is to put a hook in global ajaxSuccess that does that
[13:54:03] <robertmaxrees> do it inside of the .done() callback of your ajax.
[13:54:18] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating the init with the event
[13:55:59] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: it's a big site with all kinds of ajax that can return all kinds of html. There's also a bunch of behavior like this that needs to be applied to incoming html .modal(), .tooltip(), plus behavior for media (video, audio) which doesn't seem delgatable either. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11291651/why-dont-audio-and-video-events-bubble
[13:56:18] <benlieb> I'm going to try my luck with the global...
[13:56:22] <robertmaxrees> only some events can be delegated.
[13:56:41] <robertmaxrees> not all events bubble
[13:58:10] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating the init of the tooltip with events.
[14:04:22] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: the init of the tooltip attaches an event hanlder
[14:04:34] <robertmaxrees> right, you cannot control that unless you expose some way to do that.
[14:04:42] <benlieb> that's right
[14:04:55] <robertmaxrees> but something tells me it needs a directly bound event because of how their code is determining context.
[14:05:09] <robertmaxrees> *event listener, rather
[14:05:31] <benlieb> so my question was about the best way to handle situations where I really need delegation but I don't control the event listener attachment
[14:05:54] <benlieb> right now I just have to reapply .tooltip() to incoming new elements
[14:05:56] <robertmaxrees> you can't really do much.
[14:06:04] <robertmaxrees> because you don't control the initial listener attachment.
[14:06:09] <benlieb> right
[14:06:33] <benlieb> right now I'm just using a global ajaxSuccess to watch for any incoming new tooltipable elements
[14:06:46] <benlieb> and some other similar things...
[14:06:49] <benlieb> best I can think of
[14:07:02] <robertmaxrees> that's really your only choice afaik.
[14:07:47] <benlieb> yeah, so it ends up looking like this: https://gist.github.com/pixelterra/f5869a5f9b04fe0b45f1
[14:08:17] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't directly attach a .done() to your ajax stuff?
[14:09:03] <benlieb> that would have to call the same method for every ajax call.
[14:09:29] <robertmaxrees> you could also chain of a bunch of deferreds into a queue and run the .done() against that.
[14:09:30] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[14:09:31] <benlieb> it needs to be done for all of them, so this way does it for all of them
[14:18:32] <nonconvergent> Hey, if I don't know jquery OR javascript very well, (but I do know how to program), where should I start?
[14:18:39] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[14:18:48] <nonconvergent> At least, imperative programming languages.
[14:18:55] <robertmaxrees> codecademy.com is another good resource.
[14:18:57] <nonconvergent> Functional is a timorous beastie.
[14:19:03] <robertmaxrees> mdn has some tutorials on it, too.
[14:19:11] <robertmaxrees> you can do OO-like programming in JS.
[14:19:16] <robertmaxrees> or FP, or whatever you want to do.
[14:19:45] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: Yeah, but it seems a little different, with everything built around prototyping.
[14:20:18] <robertmaxrees> *prototypes, and some people argue that you can use some strategies to effectrively do almost classical OO.
[14:20:24] <robertmaxrees> it's awkward IMO, but people do it.
[14:21:20] <robertmaxrees> what languages do you know?
[14:21:24] <Zzaichik> anyone in here super familiar with Less CSS?
[14:21:52] <robertmaxrees> Zzaichik might have more luck in #css
[14:22:22] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: I'm a Java-heavy Computer Science-trained guy but just got my first job in webdev, so I'm having to learn the Spring Framework, Javascript, Jquery, and JSP (or at least the spring heavy version they use) all at once.
[14:22:24] <robertmaxrees> also, SASS is the hot shit these days :)
[14:22:38] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent aaah, you'll have fun then :)
[14:22:42] <Zzaichik> meh
[14:22:47] <robertmaxrees> check out JavaScript: The Good Parts.
[14:22:49] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: Was that sarcasm?
[14:22:58] <Zzaichik> SASS is awesome, but I prefer just stay in the same env (node)
[14:23:00] <Zzaichik> JavaScript
[14:23:13] <robertmaxrees> Zzaichik either way, you'll have more luck in #css probably?
[14:23:18] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent not at all.
[14:23:19] <nonconvergent> I keep looking at Eloquent Javascript and realizing I must be the only person I know who has ever read this.
[14:23:25] <Zzaichik> cool
[14:23:26] <Zzaichik> thanks
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> eloquent is semi popular.  javascript: the definitive guide is a good one.  so is the good parts.
[14:23:40] <robertmaxrees> do 'em.
[14:23:46] <robertmaxrees> especially the latter.
[14:23:56] <robertmaxrees> you'll really appreciate the way it breaks things down.
[14:24:15] <nonconvergent> I don't get why they keep using jquery to write anonymous functions.  Does it bring something extra in, or is it a six one way/half dozen the other?
[14:24:28] <robertmaxrees> totally depends on the use case.
[14:24:38] <robertmaxrees> I think you mean within handlers, for instance?
[14:24:47] <robertmaxrees> or do you have a specific example.
[14:25:16] <tw2113> i'm against anon functions in php, yet i use them regularly in js?i need to fix my thinking
[14:26:05] <nonconvergent> Like this: https://gist.github.com/nonconvergent/19c809a5f7e41e724795 I understand the ease of jquery call on line 2 but why line 1?
[14:26:15] <robertmaxrees> line 1 is a document ready call.
[14:26:24] <robertmaxrees> that runs the code after the page fires the domready event
[14:26:52] <robertmaxrees> same thing as doing $(document).ready(function() {});
[14:26:53] <nonconvergent> just sugar for that?
[14:27:13] <robertmaxrees> sugar for what I pasted, yeah.
[14:28:17] <robertmaxrees> also keep in mind that there are anonymous functions that have names ;) var a = function() {console.log('lol')}; is an anonymous function expression, for instance.
[14:28:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4xa58jnq/1/ for the three ways to declare a function.
[14:39:11] <nonconvergent> Anyone have an idea for my current issue: I've made a hidden div (style="display:hidden") in the page and want to make it magically appear now. $("#myDiv").css("display","block"); seems to work but I'm not sure it's responsive as it needs to be.
[14:39:55] <robertmaxrees> avoid editing inline styles like that.
[14:39:57] <robertmaxrees> use classes.
[14:40:32] <robertmaxrees> your company should have a class in the global css that's something like .hide or .hidden
[14:42:16] <feyoviju> Help me please. Slide toggle not working properly. http://jsfiddle.net/feyoviju/4st8a678/    Thank you.
[14:42:57] <robertmaxrees> invalid js
[14:43:31] <robertmaxrees> wait maybe not.
[14:43:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4st8a678/1/ works fine...
[14:44:11] <robertmaxrees> use .prop() instead of .attr().  should shouldn't matter though
[14:44:38] <robertmaxrees> unless i'm not sure what your issue is.
[14:45:30] <feyoviju> I do not understand why it is not good :)
[14:45:36] <robertmaxrees> what isn't working?
[14:46:19] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: It's bootstrap so there probably is something like that...I forgot to list bootstrap in the list of things I have to learn.
[14:46:22] <nonconvergent> :P
[14:46:31] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap is simple.
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> use .addClass() and .removeClass() when you can.
[15:09:48] <PFH> Can someone please explain why $("a.list-field"); only selects one element?
[15:14:08] <systemfault> Because you only have a single element that is a <a class="list-field"></a> ?
[15:15:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:17:37] <robertmaxrees> PFH are you only getting 1 when you do $("a.list-field").length ?
[15:19:25] <PFH> I was silly, Jquery wasn't loaded on the page I was trying to tweak. Wanted to quickly set everything to open in a new window as opposed to having to right click then hit open in a new window.
[15:19:53] <robertmaxrees> ah
[15:19:54] <PFH> $("a.list-field").attr("target","_blank"): worked.
[15:20:01] <PFH> ;**
[15:20:25] <PFH> Figured my company had jQuery every, I guess they missed it on this one page...
[15:20:32] <PFH> everywhere on our software**
[15:20:36] <PFH> c'est la vie, thanks Robert :D
[15:20:44] <robertmaxrees> btw use .pr...
[15:29:12] <vexadecimal> Anyone know if it's possible to change the opacity on a background image on a div without affecting the opacity of the div itself using jquery 1.11.1?
[15:29:40] <blackkbot> yeah don't put it as the background image of that div
[15:30:17] <robertmaxrees> can't you use rgba on just backgrounds?
[15:30:38] <blackkbot> yeah you can but then thats a rgba color for the background not a background image with alpha
[15:31:00] <robertmaxrees> ah
[15:31:00] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/transparent-background-images/
[15:31:03] <robertmaxrees> good point.
[15:31:53] <vexadecimal> Fair enough. I was hoping to keep the markup minimal and avoid additional divs. Alright, thanks you two!
[15:31:55] <blackkbot> yeah just put in another element to 'simulate' the background image
[15:33:45] <vexadecimal> blackkbot: Cool - thanks!
[15:59:55] <Respek> anyone mind talking me through a problem?
[16:00:08] <robertmaxrees> just ask :)
[16:00:09] <Respek> I'll do the research myself, just curious what a more experienced eye would see
[16:00:12] <Respek> hi robertmaxrees :)
[16:01:07] <Respek> cool, I'll snap a screenshot for context
[16:01:20] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:01:24] <robertmaxrees> can you share code instead?
[16:01:29] <robertmaxrees> screenshots aren't really helpful.
[16:02:29] <blackkbot> jsfiddle.com is really helpful
[16:02:32] <blackkbot> err
[16:02:33] <blackkbot> .net
[16:02:41] <Respek> it's a conceptual thing, I'm not running into a problem yet. I'd just like to hear thoughts on methods one might use. If you'd like the code, I can do that though
[16:02:58] <robertmaxrees> or just explain the question ;)
[16:03:15] <blackkbot> you can probably just link to a blog that discusses the concept or something if you don't wanna type lol
[16:04:13] <Respek> lol well here's the image anyways and the concept.
[16:04:15] <Respek> http://imgur.com/VYg2Bam
[16:04:31] <robertmaxrees> "tossed"?
[16:04:46] <Respek> haha placeholder. it will be replaced
[16:05:12] <Respek> so this is basically going to be a this one vs this one app
[16:05:55] <jQTest> I am looking forward to start contributing to jquery. Can anyone help me with open and fairly easy ones just to start with
[16:05:57] <Respek> What I need to do, is pull the content into the left, and right, and then depending on which one is clicked, tell the server which one to log, and replace each with new content
[16:06:08] <robertmaxrees> jQTest head over to #jquery-dev for that kind of thing.
[16:06:26] <jQTest> Thanks
[16:06:40] <robertmaxrees> Respek okay. which part do you need help with?
[16:07:19] <Respek> well, just surface level stuff really. I'd like to see how others with more experience and familiarity with jQuery think about doing API stuff, and content manipulation
[16:07:36] <robertmaxrees> for the frontend, start with your html.
[16:07:40] <robertmaxrees> build out the interface
[16:08:27] <robertmaxrees> think about how you'll tie those clicks to your backend, too.
[16:08:37] <robertmaxrees> how are you going to associate a click on a button with a "vote" for a thing.
[16:10:58] <blackkbot> you put the things html into a generated form textbox and then submit it to your server however your server can handle it
[16:11:11] <Respek> so just breaking the larger idea into components, and taking each one step by step.
[16:11:16] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:11:22] <Respek> manageable components that is
[16:11:24] <Respek> :)
[16:11:24] <robertmaxrees> componentization is a big thing.
[16:11:36] <robertmaxrees> and separations of concern, that's another good one.
[16:12:48] <Richard82> hi
[16:13:08] <Richard82> I experience a very weird problem
[16:13:16] <Richard82> when I open the demo, it works perfectly:
[16:13:17] <Richard82> http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/dialog/default.html
[16:13:35] <Richard82> when downloading the demo and opening it on my own computer - no modal window pops up
[16:13:57] <robertmaxrees> Richard82 could you share your page's code on a fixee?
[16:14:04] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/home/
[16:14:25] <Richard82> solved
[16:14:34] <Richard82> robertmaxrees, I should have seen it
[16:14:37] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:14:37] <Richard82> I smelled it
[16:14:43] <Richard82> I knew this is bad style
[16:14:45] <Respek> good old rubber ducky phenomenon
[16:14:49] <Richard82> there is  // in the front of the links
[16:14:58] <Richard82> 	<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>
[16:14:58] <Richard82> 	<script src="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[16:15:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[16:15:09] <Richard82> just replacing // by http://  helped
[16:15:15] <robertmaxrees> are you not running a local server for development?
[16:15:31] <Richard82> I just copied it to /home/richard
[16:15:38] <Richard82> my bad
[16:15:40] <Richard82> sorry for bothering
[16:15:44] <robertmaxrees> no big.
[16:15:48] <robertmaxrees> check out jsfiddle.com btw
[16:15:58] <Richard82> robertmaxrees, could you please give me just an other short hint?
[16:16:09] <robertmaxrees> err, jsfiddle.net, rather.
[16:16:11] <Richard82> how to darken the background while modal window is open ?
[16:16:19] <Richard82> yep, jsfiddle is nice :)
[16:16:23] <robertmaxrees> setup a sample fiddle :)
[16:16:34] <Richard82> now?
[16:16:35] <Richard82> it works
[16:16:44] <blackkbot> jsfiddle.net .com is not a page
[16:16:45] <Richard82> I only need the darkened background ^.^
[16:16:54] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.net is a page.
[16:17:09] <Richard82> I know it's for testing purposes
[16:17:24] <robertmaxrees> i corrected myself already.  Richard82 we can show you how or show you what you're doing wrong ;)
[16:17:58] <Richard82> but I am not doing anything wrong any more?
[16:18:12] <Richard82> I only asked how to darken the background (overlay) while the modal window is still active
[16:18:33] <Richard82> you might need to know that english is not my first language
[16:18:43] <robertmaxrees> that's fine, and irrelevant :)
[16:19:10] <Richard82> I only wanted to inform you, that I am not ignorant - it might only be a misunderstanding
[16:19:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-confirmation
[16:19:24] <robertmaxrees> not saying you're ignorant - and this will show you what you need to do.
[16:21:21] <Richard82> robertmaxrees, awsome !!! Thank you sooooooooo much !!!
[16:21:44] <Richard82> especially thank you for the instant and easy-going help you just provided - thank you sooo much :)
[16:21:49] <robertmaxrees> sure
[16:21:53] <robertmaxrees> that's why we're here.
[16:22:18] <Richard82> It's interesting to see,how IRC changed over the years
[16:22:30] <Richard82> when I started in IT,  IRC was the most normal thing in the world
[16:22:38] <Richard82> my new collegues don't even know that IRC exist
[16:22:42] <Richard82> same goes for the usenet
[16:22:55] <robertmaxrees> it's still alive and kicking.
[16:23:02] <Richard82> many channels are near empty now,  on the other hand,  many new channels have been opened
[16:23:08] <Richard82> anyway,  many, many users went off
[16:23:17] <robertmaxrees> and many new ones came in to take their place :)
[16:23:34] <Richard82> heh :)
[16:23:38] <robertmaxrees> perhaps not as ubiquitous, but still kicking :)
[16:23:50] <Richard82> I can remember when I programmed my first IRC client using  IO::Socket  (a CPAN module for Perl)
[16:23:57] <robertmaxrees> cool
[16:24:03] <Richard82> yep, indeed it was
[16:24:14] <Richard82> that was the first time I heard about RFC :)
[16:24:21] <Richard82> whatever, sorry for talking so much
[16:24:26] <robertmaxrees> not a problem.
[16:25:20] <blackkbot> robertmaxrees what are you working on?... im bored i think ive only made this today... https://gist.github.com/darbicus/d7351dc4636cb2c544fb and this is nothing new to me since ive done it before
[16:25:26] <blackkbot> feed meee
[16:25:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm working on something i can't quite talk about yet.
[16:26:05] <blackkbot> nsa?
[16:26:22] <robertmaxrees> haha, nah.  just a new site feature i can't really discuss.  nothing mind blowing.
[16:27:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm using it as a chance to do something in a really FP inspired style, though
[16:27:47] <Richard82> blackkbot, so you are bored and want to work?
[16:28:30] <blackkbot> yeah... im listening to a 6 year old play some stupid game and my gf bitch about the job she just got and hasn't even gone in for her first day
[16:28:45] <Richard82> oh
[16:28:47] <blackkbot> soo anything to distract would be welcome lol
[16:28:48] <Richard82> are you good in PHP and wordpress and accept paid tasks?
[16:29:37] <blackkbot> i know that php exists and i know how to google to find php stuff... ive heard of wordpress never really used it but it is a website thing so i can do it and yes i take money
[16:29:47] <benlieb_> I'm trying to do some site usage logging via $.post calls to a tracking script. What do I send to be able to track the session?
[16:30:39] <Richard82> huh.... well, the task is *extremly* tricky... so if you don't actually *know* wordpress and PHP inside-out ...
[16:31:00] <robertmaxrees> Richard82 and blackkbot could you guys take it to a PM or a more appropriate channel? :)
[16:31:00] <blackkbot> i know them outside-in
[16:31:06] <Richard82> sorry
[16:31:11] <robertmaxrees> benlieb_ err, do what now?
[16:32:15] <benlieb_> robertmaxrees: I'm tracker certain user activity on my site (like playing videos etc). In the event handlers I'm sending back some data to my app about the environment the events happened in
[16:32:34] <benlieb_> I'm doing this via $.post(url, data)
[16:32:40] <robertmaxrees> that part i get.
[16:32:43] <robertmaxrees> explain the session bit.
[16:32:45] <benlieb_> but the session isn't being preserved
[16:33:02] <benlieb_> The browser usually sends session cookies
[16:33:05] <robertmaxrees> how are you handling sessions?
[16:33:17] <robertmaxrees> via a cookie?  or otherwise?
[16:33:29] <benlieb_> I thought that .post() did too, but I can't seem to attach the data to a session in the app.
[16:33:36] <benlieb_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2870371/why-is-jquerys-ajax-method-not-sending-my-session-cookie
[16:33:53] <benlieb_> it's not cross-site
[16:34:05] <robertmaxrees> same port, domain, subomain, and protocol?
[16:35:01] <robertmaxrees> so you're doing http://mysite.com -> http://mysite.com ?  if anything changes on that, it's a CORS issue.
[16:35:18] <benlieb_> robertmaxrees: yes, it's actually a relative lin
[16:35:19] <benlieb_> link
[16:36:01] <robertmaxrees> benlieb_ then no idea without seeing your code.
[16:36:49] <benlieb_> robertmaxrees: it may be a rails thing. here are the request headers, it seems to be sending the cookies, or some cookies: https://gist.github.com/pixelterra/a0093de39564fa1f2125
[16:37:31] <robertmaxrees> dunno.  not really familiar with rails.
[16:37:31] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[16:41:48] <benlieb_> ok, it is, I just forgot to log the session id. Programmer error. surprise surprise.
[16:42:39] <robertmaxrees> it's always something simple :)
[16:52:47] <Richard82> robertmaxrees?  I am experiencing a conflict :(
[16:52:59] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Richard82
[16:53:00] <b-ot> Richard82: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:53:14] <Richard82> it's a joomla site which already uses jquery-min and it seems as if they would cause conflicts
[16:53:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:53:42] <robertmaxrees> you're not trying to use multiple versions of jquery, are you?
[16:53:53] <Richard82> well... ^^
[16:53:55] <Richard82> yes?
[16:54:09] <Richard82> I already commented out the latter one
[16:54:09] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[16:54:15] <robertmaxrees> only run one version.  ever
[16:54:22] <Richard82> but then the modal window does not work any more if only  jquery-min is loaded
[16:54:28] <robertmaxrees> it's possible to run multiple, but it's a massive PITA
[16:54:33] <robertmaxrees> do you have jquery ui loaded as well?
[16:54:37] <Richard82> yes
[16:54:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to have jquery AND jquery UI loaded.
[16:54:45] <Richard82> both are
[16:54:46] <robertmaxrees> is noconflict mode turned on?
[16:54:50] <Richard82> yes
[16:54:56] <robertmaxrees> so you're using jQuery instead of $?
[16:55:06] <Richard82> am I ?
[16:55:14] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[16:55:16] <robertmaxrees> you tell me.
[16:55:18] <Richard82> so am I
[16:55:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:55:33] <Richard82> <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[16:55:39] <Richard82> answer:  that makes two of us
[16:55:43] <blackkbot> 3
[16:55:46] <Richard82> lol
[16:55:48] <robertmaxrees> in your code, are you using $() or jQuery() ?
[16:55:56] <robertmaxrees> if you have noconflict turned on, you cannot use the $ shortcut.
[16:55:57] <Richard82> $(function() {
[16:55:57] <Richard82> $( "#dialog-confirm" ).dialog({
[16:56:04] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste into the channel.
[16:56:09] <robertmaxrees> swap those for jQuery
[16:56:12] <robertmaxrees> instead of $
[16:56:15] <Richard82> ok
[16:57:17] <robertmaxrees> noconflict mode makes it so you cannot use $ any more.
[16:57:18] <Richard82> it works now - except the close button
[16:57:23] <robertmaxrees> unless you scope things differently.
[16:58:09] <Richard82> it works :))
[16:58:17] <Richard82> I forgot a $ symbol
[16:58:21] <Richard82> awsome :)
[16:58:29] <Richard82> thank you very, very much !!!
[16:58:38] <robertmaxrees> check out learn.jquery.com btw
[16:59:29] <Richard82> I will indeed
[16:59:43] <blackkbot> you could just do var º = jQuery; and then use that symbol for jquery
[16:59:59] <robertmaxrees> that's not a great idea >.>
[17:00:05] <Richard82> why not?
[17:00:06] <robertmaxrees> use a jquery wrapper instead.
[17:00:09] <blackkbot> lol
[17:00:41] <Richard82> is it possible, that this modal window causes the slider images _not_ to preload?
[17:00:46] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/5z42j8f/
[17:00:47] <robertmaxrees> do this.
[17:01:08] <robertmaxrees> sure - remove the image tags and append them after you click to open the modal.
[17:01:18] <blackkbot> right on thats an easy way to solve that problem
[17:01:26] <robertmaxrees> and a safe way
[17:02:17] <Richard82> thank you for the jsfiddle link
[17:02:26] <robertmaxrees> yep
[17:12:19] <Richard82> bye bye :-)
[17:12:26] <Richard82> thank you very much robertmaxrees
[17:12:27] <Richard82> sleep fine
[17:12:28] <Richard82> bye
[17:13:24] <robertmaxrees> lol "sleep"
[17:47:51] <Respek> heading out, thanks for the great support and thoughts all
[17:48:11] <uskerine> hi
[17:51:40] <jeffreylevesque> could someone be so kind to facilitate my understanding of ajax?
[17:52:52] <uskerine> Head first AJAX
[17:53:13] <jeffreylevesque> i have ajax send my data from html <form> to a php action script
[17:53:20] <xenaxon> hi
[17:53:28] <xenaxon> www.test.com
[17:53:41] <jeffreylevesque> the 'success' callback is not run.  But, 'developer tools' says 200 messages for each file executed
[17:53:51] <jeffreylevesque> https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/issues/101
[17:56:58] <robertmaxrees> use .done() btw.
[17:57:24] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done(function() {});
[17:57:39] <robertmaxrees> requests can fail because they're poorly formatted.
[17:57:46] <robertmaxrees> so check out .fail() to see what the issue is.
[18:01:39] <dafgodo> t
[18:01:50] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque that make sense?
[18:02:19] <dafgodo> H
[18:02:25] <robertmaxrees> n
[18:02:56] <dafgodo> https://i.imgur.com/DgoIJP7.jpg
[18:03:11] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:03:17] <robertmaxrees> dafgodo did you need some help?
[18:03:29] <dafgodo> nah man, thanks
[18:03:35] <uskerine> hi, I would ilke to invoke a web service  that returns a pdf file, but as it takes some time to generate the PDF I would like to understand how to do something while downloading (change cursor, display modal, etc.) while the back-end servers generates the file.
[18:03:48] <robertmaxrees> dafgodo then what are you doing?
[18:04:40] <uskerine> just point me in the right direction and  I'll do the homework
[18:04:48] <uskerine> -I know is a bit general question-
[18:05:07] <robertmaxrees> uskerine change the screen on the click event and then change the display when the download has started?
[18:05:58] <uskerine> please elaborate, let's say that I listen for the click event, and I display a modal popup
[18:06:06] <uskerine> how do I detect when download has started?
[18:06:28] <robertmaxrees> that's your homework :)
[18:06:29] <uskerine> and how do I call the web service to ensrue that the web browser actually pops up you with the OPEN/SAVE window
[18:06:35] <sammych> .ui-state-disabled is not being added to .ui-select > .ui-btn http://jsbin.com/kofuwe/1/edit
[18:07:07] <robertmaxrees> uskerine through a URL?
[18:07:57] <uskerine> I have read that you have to use an <a> element
[18:08:12] <uskerine> I actually tried and AJAX call but the browser does not pop up you the OPEN/SAVE dialog
[18:08:12] <robertmaxrees> uskerine right - a link...
[18:08:51] <uskerine> ok so I would have a button, can I simulate a link press?
[18:09:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:09:41] <uskerine> using .trigger?
[18:09:52] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, yep.
[18:10:05] <uskerine> which way would you recommend?
[18:10:33] <sammych> there are certain events you can't mimic
[18:10:47] <robertmaxrees> window.location.href="the/url/to/your/thing.pdf"
[18:10:51] <uskerine> ok
[18:10:54] <robertmaxrees> sammych huh?  like that?
[18:11:13] <robertmaxrees> you can trigger any event you want.  there is, however, a distinction between jquery events and native browser evemts.
[18:11:40] <robertmaxrees> you can't trigger native using jquery.
[18:11:42] <uskerine> so my button can display a modal popup to alert the user that his/her stuff is being downloaded and avoid OCD users click and reclick
[18:12:03] <uskerine> and it would launch the window.location.href="thePDFthing"
[18:12:17] <uskerine> now how would I detect that the download has started to remove the modal window?
[18:12:19] <robertmaxrees> sure, you could do something like that.  you could also check in your backend if that user has already tried to initiate the download, too.
[18:12:28] <sammych> if you have popup blocking enabled, the user has to click on links to open them up. window.local.href = 'bnlah' won't do anything
[18:12:53] <sammych> so you can't just make a <a href="blah>blah</a> and then click on it to open it
[18:13:03] <sammych> click()
[18:13:44] <uskerine> that's a good point, but the browser would usually also alert the user that a popup has been blocked
[18:14:00] <uskerine> I am fine with that
[18:14:12] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't trigger a popup block, but i could be wrong.
[18:14:47] <uskerine> robertmaxrees, how would I know when download starts so I can remove the cool app "downloading popup2
[18:14:47] <uskerine> ?
[18:15:07] <uskerine> "downloading webapp popup"
[18:15:21] <robertmaxrees> search google :)
[18:15:40] <robertmaxrees> lots of examples.
[18:16:18] <uskerine> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1106377/detect-when-browser-receives-file-download
[18:16:30] <uskerine> I thought it was more immediate,
[18:16:48] <robertmaxrees> what problem are you really trying to solve for?
[18:17:23] <uskerine> the user clicks on a button in the webapp that generates a PDF
[18:17:35] <uskerine> but as the PDF is not ready (it is dynamically generated by the backend)
[18:17:46] <uskerine> it takes few seconds (say 10 seconds) to generate it
[18:17:58] <uskerine> and 10 seconds seems like... too much time for a user
[18:18:10] <uskerine> sort kind of "Downloading..." window should be displayed
[18:18:25] <robertmaxrees> you could give them a modal and let them manually dismiss it.
[18:18:26] <uskerine> then once the browser OPEN/SAVE popup appears, that Downloading... should disappear normally
[18:19:00] <uskerine> isn't that a bit "clumsy"?
[18:19:17] <uskerine> like the user would say, why do I have to dismiss that if the PDF is already being downloaded
[18:19:30] <robertmaxrees> your use case is sort of unusual.
[18:19:38] <uskerine> really? :!
[18:19:41] <robertmaxrees> taking 10 seconds to generate a PDF is "clumsy" ;)
[18:19:42] <uskerine> I find it quite natural
[18:19:50] <uskerine> I TOTALLY agree on to that
[18:19:58] <uskerine> but believe me I can't see how to speed up
[18:20:10] <uskerine> I am using apache fop and a couple of XSLT rounds
[18:20:11] <robertmaxrees> what's making it take so long?
[18:20:16] <uskerine> honestly I don't know
[18:20:18] <robertmaxrees> because that's your real issue.
[18:20:38] <uskerine> but it is not an application issue, as it takes same time when you run the conversion from console
[18:20:39] <robertmaxrees> don't hack in some kind of fix when the real problem is that it takes 10 seconds.
[18:20:55] <robertmaxrees> find a faster way to generate that PDF.
[18:21:49] <uskerine> well, robermaxrees, that's sort kind saying.... find a faster way to fix world hunger :)
[18:21:55] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[18:21:59] <robertmaxrees> 10 seconds is way too long.
[18:22:02] <uskerine> what can I do to speed up a PDF, give me some clue
[18:22:16] <robertmaxrees> how are you currently generating them?
[18:22:22] <uskerine> I generate a XML
[18:22:22] <robertmaxrees> where is the process slowing you down?
[18:22:24] <uskerine> that takes nothing
[18:22:35] <uskerine> then that XML is transformed into another XML via XSLT (xalan)
[18:22:49] <uskerine> and that another XML is transformed into XSL-FO via XSLT (xalan)
[18:22:58] <uskerine> and that XSL-FO is transformed into a PDF via Apache FOP
[18:23:08] <uskerine> as I have been told there is nothing bad in the process
[18:23:14] <robertmaxrees> which step in there takes the longest?
[18:23:33] <uskerine> out of the 10seconds,
[18:23:46] <robertmaxrees> how long does each step take, roughly?
[18:23:47] <uskerine> say that 3 are for the first XSLT, 3 for the other XSLT and 3 for the XSL-FO processing
[18:23:51] <uskerine> roughly
[18:23:54] <uskerine> you get the idea
[18:23:54] <robertmaxrees> that is unreasonable.
[18:24:03] <robertmaxrees> generate the XML you need initially.
[18:24:04] <uskerine> is not like.... 50mseconds one and 9.5 seconds one
[18:24:21] <robertmaxrees> how much data is this?
[18:25:21] <uskerine> it is not too much
[18:25:36] <robertmaxrees> then generate the xml you need on the first go-round, not the third.
[18:25:44] <uskerine> it is generating something similar to a delivery note
[18:25:50] <uskerine> I can't do that
[18:25:57] <uskerine> that's the whole purpose of XSLT
[18:26:01] <uskerine> to simplify document generation
[18:26:17] <robertmaxrees> i know what XSLT is - you're convoluting the process.
[18:26:20] <uskerine> generating the last XML from the beginning is quite difficult
[18:26:31] <robertmaxrees> output the XML you need from the beginning.
[18:27:00] <uskerine> even doing that
[18:27:07] <uskerine> Apache FOP would still take  3 seconds
[18:27:12] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[18:27:14] <uskerine> to generate the PDF
[18:27:33] <robertmaxrees> hell, generate HTML and use phantom to generate the PDF if that last 3 seconds is too much.
[18:28:48] <uskerine> I'll have a look into that
[18:29:07] <uskerine> that was the first idea, to generate the PDF from the HTML
[18:30:04] <robertmaxrees> that's the smart way to do it.
[18:30:12] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're building up some bad UX.
[18:31:49] <uskerine> I see
[18:32:12] <uskerine> I will consider that
[18:32:35] <uskerine> but I am in a hurry to get this working (even when I agree that 10 seconds is too much)
[18:32:42] <robertmaxrees> then read google.
[18:32:58] <robertmaxrees> but the manually dismissable modal is probably your closest bet.
[18:33:11] <uskerine> I am thinking in two webservices, one to generate the PDF (so I call it I display the modal and once the PDF file is generated the done stuff will remove the modal and launch the actual get service)
[18:33:30] <uskerine> and the actual get service will just deliver the PDF, which would be already cooked
[18:33:34] <uskerine> what do you think?
[18:33:40] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[18:33:45] <robertmaxrees> depends on how your stuff is setup.
[18:33:55] <robertmaxrees> but that sounds like it'd take about the same amount of time ;)
[18:34:01] <uskerine> yeah
[18:34:22] <uskerine> and we both agree that's too much time, but it is ok for the user to wait 10 seconds to get the file, is soooo important to them :)
[18:34:25] <uskerine> they will wait
[18:34:26] <uskerine> :)
[18:34:32] <robertmaxrees> i don't agree.
[18:34:33] <robertmaxrees> but okay
[18:35:08] <uskerine> I prefer regular and delivered now, and improved in few weeks than perfect in weeks and no delivery now
[18:35:38] <robertmaxrees> the amount of time it would take you to output HTML and ship it via phantom should not take that long, but okay.
[18:36:23] <robertmaxrees> but that's okay.
[18:50:41] <uskerine> it would take days and I am 2 months behind schedule  :)
[18:50:48] <uskerine> but I will seriously consider phantom
[18:51:03] <uskerine> for next review/version, there are other things to include first
[18:51:55] <uskerine> in my case everything is new and everything takes much more time than probably you require
[19:57:53] <TorpedoSkyline> Hey guys, is it possible to target pseudo element in jQuery?
[20:41:44] <tw2113> i believe so, yes
[20:42:14] <shoky> i believe not
[20:44:04] <tw2113> trust shoky over me
[20:45:29] <shoky> if you say so
[20:45:48] <tw2113> i do
[20:45:57] <tw2113> am i a fool for that
[20:46:28] <shoky> a knucklehead, maybe
[21:03:07] <crystal77> Is jQuery the best way to make a grid of squares that are evenly spaces on the browser?
[21:21:30] <Khari> howdy. Is it possible to use POST data twice? I want to send an email using the data in a form, and then redirect to another form page (all from one submit button push). I can get one or the other working, but not both.
[21:23:18] <tw2113> so you're trying to use the form data from one form to email and then auto-fill another form?
[21:23:47] <tw2113> or are you wanting it to auto-submit the other form?
[21:24:07] <tw2113> trying to work out your logic here
[21:24:16] <Khari> not quite autofill, but more or less. We are trying to collect user data from the first form, but we need to redirect to an outside vendor for payment information.
[21:24:50] <Khari> the first form relates to conference data
[21:24:59] <Khari> which we need as an email to us
[21:25:19] <tw2113> hmm, not sure personally
[21:39:51] <Khari> very roughly, my code looks like this: http://jsbin.com/delagabusati/1/edit
[22:09:12] <elmcrest> good morning. Do you guys also use this autonumeric plugin? http://www.decorplanit.com/plugin/
[22:47:56] <gurke_> good morning. :)
