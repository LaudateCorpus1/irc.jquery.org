[17:34:21] <Northwoods> when i click on row send TEXT , i replace that button with a text area and another send-text button , how can i get the value of textarea when clicked upon second send text button
[17:34:30] <Northwoods> $(this).closest('.txarea').val();
[17:34:40] <Northwoods> this doesn't seem to be working
[17:34:48] <robertmaxrees> show the markup in a fiddle.
[17:34:51] <robertmaxrees> and the js.
[17:35:01] <Northwoods> http://prntscr.com/vt6e5u
[17:35:13] <robertmaxrees> that is not what i asked for :)
[17:35:18] <Northwoods> :)\
[17:35:26] <robertmaxrees> i can't see the html, so i don't know what traversal methods you need.,
[17:35:36] <Northwoods> ok let me make it quickly
[17:39:06] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/01nyf769/
[17:39:59] <robertmaxrees> strange way to do that but OK.
[17:40:45] <Northwoods> :)
[17:41:06] <robertmaxrees> your best bet would be to first give it a more descriptive classname than 'txarea', then do something like $(this).closest('tr').find('.theClassNameHere').
[17:41:17] <robertmaxrees> or give the TD a classname to rely on and closest() to that.
[17:43:15] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, thanks this one worked  --> $(this).closest('tr').find('.theClassNameHere');
[17:43:36] <robertmaxrees> cool
