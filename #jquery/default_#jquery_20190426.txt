[02:42:02] <sydbarret> anybody awake_
[02:44:31] <robertmaxrees> yep
[02:44:49] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question. if someone can help, they will :)
[02:47:09] <Jasein> I have a serach field in my header that I want to disappear when anything outside fo the search form is clicked. How do I catch clicks on elements that have have stopped the propagation of the click event?
[02:47:36] <robertmaxrees> you can't without directly binding to them.
[02:48:05] <robertmaxrees> people overly abuse stopping propagation
[02:49:32] <Jasein> I see.. Is there another good way to handle this? perhaps an overlay for the entire screen that is transparent?
[02:50:00] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[02:50:33] <Jasein> But how do I propograte down the path so the click does what it was originally supposed to do?
[02:50:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[02:51:06] <Jasein> In other words, if someone clicks a link on the page it triggers the transparent layer cvlick handler. How do I then click the link they wanted
[02:51:08] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to do a full overlay, you bind a listener to the document that listens for it.
[02:51:18] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[02:51:31] <robertmaxrees> if you do an overlay, any click on it dismisses it.
[02:51:42] <robertmaxrees> the overlay should dim the site.
[02:52:08] <robertmaxrees> to bring focus to the site search.
[02:52:09] <Jasein> It's a simple site-search feature that shows the search field when the ? is clicked
[02:52:40] <Jasein> so I dont' want it to be modal. I just want it to disappear if it loses focus...
[02:52:42] <Jasein> got it
[02:52:50] <Jasein> that's what I was trying to figure out...
[02:53:02] <robertmaxrees> lots of sites to exactly that.
[02:53:23] <robertmaxrees> dim the page when the search bar is focused.
[02:54:07] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees i have this https://bpaste.net/show/f2b7dd903db5
[02:54:15] <Jasein> I hear ya. If I wanted a modal search box then I kind of feel like you should make it a full-on modal window
[02:54:38] <robertmaxrees> Jasein except it's not a modal
[02:54:42] <robertmaxrees> more like a popover.
[02:54:50] <robertmaxrees> but similar behavior i guess.
[02:55:08] <robertmaxrees> bit what do I know? i just worked on search for a major ecommerce company for a year and a half ;)
[02:55:44] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret so you want to loop through entries in a DataTable?
[02:56:20] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees yes
[02:56:28] <sydbarret> so im using that button datatable
[02:56:40] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/reference/api/rows().every()
[02:57:38] <Jasein> Yeah that may be highly effective for a e-commerce company but for a personal website that search is not really important---not a bigger priority than the rest of the website
[02:58:10] <robertmaxrees> Jasein let me rephrase: you either want that functionality or you don't.  half-baked versions aren't a good idea.
[02:59:29] <Jasein> Here's the deal: what I was trying to accomplish was to handle the loss of focus on the input field. I was making it more difficult than I needed (as always)
[02:59:50] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change any of my advice :)
[03:00:20] <Jasein> Right.
[03:03:14] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees  ok it works but now how can I find which ones were checked?
[03:03:33] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret which rows were checked?
[03:03:57] <sydbarret> yes this datatable has a select checkbox in the first column as well
[03:04:23] <robertmaxrees> i mean this as respectfually as possible, but
[03:04:27] <robertmaxrees> did you try google?
[03:04:36] <robertmaxrees> i just found a wealth of answers for that question
[03:04:55] <sydbarret> so im using this https://datatables.net/extensions/select/examples/initialisation/checkbox.html
[03:05:04] <robertmaxrees> so let me ask again
[03:05:08] <robertmaxrees> did you try google?
[03:05:16] <sydbarret> yes
[03:05:29] <robertmaxrees> because https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/42290/getting-the-checked-rows-in-datatables
[03:14:23] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees ok i have it now how can I send those values to the server_
[03:14:34] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees i read that i can gatter them in a hidden field
[03:15:14] <sydbarret> does jquery have a list variable where i can append perhaps and then copy to a hidden input field?
[03:15:19] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[03:15:33] <robertmaxrees> https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[03:15:52] <sydbarret> i found this https://jsfiddle.net/v4k71maj/2/
[03:16:01] <robertmaxrees> lemme clarify - i googled both of your questions so far.
[03:16:03] <sydbarret> but that uses a form
[03:16:15] <robertmaxrees> and apparently that got you up to this point.
[03:16:16] <robertmaxrees> so
[03:16:36] <sydbarret> you are better searcher than me
[03:16:41] <robertmaxrees> uh
[03:16:47] <sydbarret> i solved what you gave me
[03:16:54] <sydbarret> so i wanna move forward now
[03:16:58] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[03:17:02] <robertmaxrees> so what have you tried?
[03:17:21] <sydbarret> nothing yet i was reading the button part of this https://jsfiddle.net/v4k71maj/2/
[03:17:33] <robertmaxrees> okay so you haven't actually tried anything
[03:17:36] <robertmaxrees> righjt
[03:17:46] <robertmaxrees> so like.  what's your plan?  just ask for permission?
[03:17:51] <sydbarret> the part that says $(form).append(                  $('<input>')                     .attr('type', 'hidden')
[03:17:57] <robertmaxrees> or are you gonna actually write some code and try things?
[03:18:08] <robertmaxrees> where's your code that shows your attempt?
[03:18:09] <sydbarret> ive been doing that the whole day
[03:18:22] <sydbarret> i created a great datatable from zero
[03:18:29] <sydbarret> i can show you the screen shot
[03:18:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm not doubting your accomplishments thus far
[03:18:59] <robertmaxrees> i just want to see what you've tried to solve this particular problem.
[03:19:58] <sydbarret> but let me know if im on the right track
[03:20:04] <sydbarret> so first i have to create a hidden field?
[03:20:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't even know what you're trying to accomplish lmao
[03:20:48] <robertmaxrees> try as i might, i cannot read minds.  terribly inconvenient ;)
[03:21:01] <sydbarret> so let me show you
[03:21:06] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[03:21:14] <sydbarret>  for (var i = 0; i < dt.rows( { selected: true } ).indexes().length; i++){
[03:21:18] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[03:21:23] <robertmaxrees> no code in the channel./
[03:21:25] <robertmaxrees> pls
[03:21:26] <sydbarret> ok
[03:21:50] <robertmaxrees> if you can't explain your issue in a sentence or two, your issues are too broad
[03:22:25] <sydbarret> so https://bpaste.net/show/689513f05509
[03:22:48] <robertmaxrees> ??????
[03:22:51] <sydbarret> this already gives me the list of numbers that I need to pass to the server which is flask.
[03:23:07] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the issue
[03:23:09] <robertmaxrees> ?????
[03:23:42] <sydbarret> one way to do this is to have a hidden field called remove_ids and then fill it in with the ids using jquery and submit the form.
[03:24:00] <robertmaxrees> so then do that???
[03:26:06] <robertmaxrees> gg.  enjoy folks :)
[07:01:46] <MarkRS> Is caching of data elements not very smart? I'm using data elements to identify rows in a table, cloning them occasionally. The caching seems not to notice that I have a new row so always gives me values from the first save
[07:01:51] <MarkRS> Very annoying
[08:31:17] <thykka> MarkRS, jQuery's .data doesn't work with html data-attributes, as one might expect
[08:31:24] <thykka> they work somewhat, but are not 'live'
[08:31:45] <MarkRS> thykka: Yes, they get cached
[08:32:00] <MarkRS> Which would be ok, if they tracked properly
[08:32:40] <MarkRS> I was "surprised", shall we say :(
[08:32:47] <thykka> https://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[08:33:38] <thykka> > An element's data-* attributes are retrieved the first time the data() method is invoked upon it, and then are no longer accessed or mutated
[08:34:16] <MarkRS> Right, but it's not doing it properly. It doesn't notice that, although it's being asked for the same data attribute, it's not being asked about the same object
[08:34:31] <thykka> doing what properly?
[08:34:39] <MarkRS> keeping track of what it's caching
[08:34:47] <thykka> err.. can you provide a test case?
[08:35:09] <MarkRS> how do you mean? Verbally here or code?
[08:35:15] <thykka> in jsfiddle, for example
[08:36:28] <MarkRS> I can't cut it out of my application quick enough to do it now, but could perhaps do it later
[08:40:08] <MarkRS> My button clones the last row and updates a (data) counter in a cell in the now-new row. Thus the second row has an updated counter, no subsequent rows do, though, using newRow.data('counter')
[08:41:13] <MarkRS> It's fine using newRow.attr('data-counter')
[08:41:23] <MarkRS> Makes it a bit useless for working with tables
[13:11:38] <sydbarret> anybody awake that have worked with datatable buttons
[13:12:07] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret you're more likely to get help with datatables on their forums
[13:12:44] <sydbarret> robertmaxree you had to tell me how to store de ids in a hidden field and then how to submit the form
[13:12:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:13:02] <sydbarret> yeah last night
[13:13:07] <sydbarret> im still stuck in it
[13:13:22] <robertmaxrees> i remember
[13:13:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd still suggest hitting their forums
[13:17:02] <sydbarret> the button has an action method , can i do this ('#remove').submit() ? where remove is my form id
[13:18:24] <robertmaxrees> "the button has an action method" sounds odd.
[13:18:33] <robertmaxrees> the form should have an action.
[13:21:18] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees see this doc https://datatables.net/reference/button/selected
[13:21:22] <sydbarret> im using that
[13:21:25] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[13:21:48] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[13:22:10] <robertmaxrees> this is one way to bind a listener i guess?  but this isn't for form submits.
[13:22:11] <sydbarret> inside that action i get all ids of the rows that were checked
[13:22:15] <robertmaxrees> you should bind a form submit separately.
[13:22:17] <sydbarret> dt.rows({selected:true}).data()[i][1]
[13:23:03] <sydbarret> so you mean i cant add a submit inside that action?
[13:23:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:23:19] <robertmaxrees> i'ma reiterate: you're much more likely to get help with datatables in their forums
[13:23:35] <robertmaxrees> this is #jquery - we're not really experts on datatables :)
[13:24:06] <sydbarret> if you know jquery tell me how you submit a form in int
[13:24:09] <sydbarret> it
[13:24:24] <robertmaxrees> really?
[13:24:49] <robertmaxrees> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+how+to+submit+form
[13:25:37] <robertmaxrees> i highly recommend you check out http://learn.jquery.com/
[13:26:22] <sydbarret> its a crappy language
[13:26:27] <sydbarret> i come from python
[13:26:41] <sydbarret> allegedly you can do it with $("#myForm").submit();
[13:27:06] <sydbarret> the thing is where to put or make it fit in the datatable button
[13:43:04] <robertmaxrees> looks like you found where to put the code :) sydbarret
[13:44:12] <robertmaxrees> also: js is a solid language, and jquery isn't a language ;)
[13:44:38] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees solve the problem so i can go to lunch
[13:44:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:44:54] <robertmaxrees> that's not how we do things here :)
[15:26:48] <diverdude> Hi - it seems that js files and css files are not being updated in the browser before user deletes all history and cache....this is very annoying. Ho do i ensure that no files are ever cached and that its always the newest version of files which the browser downloads?
[15:27:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in #web :)
[18:16:33] <milos_> hello. Can someone tell me how do I get mysite.com from this code? https://jsfiddle.net/ufLmj35e/4/
[18:17:16] <robertmaxrees> well your first issue is you're trying to use .val() on a div.
[18:17:22] <robertmaxrees> divs don't have a value - they can have text though.
[18:17:28] <milos_> robertmaxrees, disregard that part
[18:17:40] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[18:17:40] <milos_> I'm worried about using proper selector
[18:17:42] <robertmaxrees> fix the fiddle.
[18:17:46] <robertmaxrees> then we can talk :)
[18:18:24] <robertmaxrees> also i'm not seeing the id result_list anywhere in there.
[18:18:35] <milos_> https://jsfiddle.net/ufLmj35e/5/
[18:19:04] <milos_> https://jsfiddle.net/ufLmj35e/6/
[18:20:33] <robertmaxrees> so a couple questions - do you have any control over this html?
[18:20:41] <milos_> robertmaxrees, nope, not at all
[18:20:46] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[18:20:57] <robertmaxrees> what makes this specific anchor different from the others?
[18:21:22] <robertmaxrees> issue is jquery's changed a lot of how selectors work, and stuff like this really shouldn't be done with convoluted selectors in the first place.
[20:06:54] <diverdude> Hi, I am trying to color a row in a table green and then fade it back to white. I am doing like this: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/NsxB5CVJkj/ but for some reason its not fading back to white. What am I missing?
[20:13:15] <pavonia> Should be {backgroundColor: "#fff"}, I think
[20:16:10] <pavonia> Or rather that: "For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless the jQuery.Color plugin is used"
[20:49:58] <sydbarret> anybody has used the action method in a button datatable?
[22:16:02] <sydbarret> HOW Do I append values to a hidden field?
[22:16:28] <sydbarret> <input type="hidden" id="remove_ids" name="remove_ids" value="">
[22:16:44] <sydbarret> i have a loop so i wanna append values
[22:26:45] <pavonia> Why append? Construct your result in that loop and set the final value
[22:53:53] <sydbarret> pavonia how? in which kind variable?
[22:54:00] <sydbarret> like in an array?
[22:54:52] <sydbarret> pavonia but how I send and array to a POST form
[22:54:58] <sydbarret> in flask
[22:56:06] <pavonia> I have no idea what flask is. Just use a normal JS var
[22:56:46] <pavonia> and afterwards $("remove_ids").val(result)
[23:38:37] <sydbarret> pavonia i have it on results variable but $("remove_ids").val(result) doesnt work. Should I add the form before? o somekind of refresh?
[23:39:23] <pavonia> Show your full code
[23:40:39] <sydbarret> pavonia https://bpaste.net/show/b177190974c5
[23:42:01] <pavonia> What is the value afterwards?
[23:43:38] <sydbarret> if i add   alert(all_checked_ids) in line 6
[23:43:43] <sydbarret> line 16 i mean
[23:43:55] <sydbarret> it prints the correct value
[23:44:06] <sydbarret> 756,757 that is
[23:44:40] <pavonia> What's the reault of $("remove_ids").val()?
[23:45:13] <sydbarret> you mean  alert($("remove_ids").val(all_checked_ids))?
[23:45:39] <pavonia> No, just .val()
[23:46:09] <sydbarret> it prints undefined
[23:46:34] <sydbarret> and alert($("remove_ids").val(all_checked_ids)) prints object Object
[23:47:12] <pavonia> undefined makes no sense
[23:47:49] <sydbarret> perhaps is not finding the text input?
[23:47:57] <pavonia> Even if the setting goes wrong, it should be an empty string
[23:48:16] <sydbarret> should i need to use like $(this).closest('form').remove_ids.val() ?
[23:48:42] <pavonia> Err well yes, it should be $("#remove_ids")
[23:50:32] <sydbarret> like this?  $(this).closest('form').$("#remove_ids").val(all_checked_ids)
[23:50:40] <sydbarret> doesnt show nothing on the box
[23:51:33] <sydbarret> how can i reference the form id itself
[23:52:01] <sydbarret> i have a form like this <form id="remove" action="{{url_for('remove_neg',id=cust_id)}}" method="POST">
[23:54:00] <pavonia> $("#remove_ids").val(all_checked_ids)
[23:57:59] <sydbarret> it works thanks
