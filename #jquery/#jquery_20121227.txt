[00:01:17] <thomedy> okay i have  question that confuses. me.. first off im not bad at this stuff but i usaully do js not jquery
[00:09:07] <smill> i have a simple jquery question i set up a test script and html on my paste here: http://jsfiddle.net/KNypr/
[00:10:22] <thomedy> okay i have  question that confuses. me.. first off im not bad at this stuff but i usaully do js not jquery  i did jquery this time cuz this site is supposed to be a simple build placemark holder
[00:10:26] <thomedy> www.thinkrium.com
[00:10:52] <thomedy> i dont know why
[00:11:06] <smill> thomedy: what is your question
[00:11:09] <thomedy> sorry
[00:11:12] <thomedy> im tirred
[00:11:21] <thomedy> i dont know why or how to ask it animates... but not well
[00:11:26] <thomedy> my pure js animation is fine
[00:11:36] <thomedy> but if you click the pfolio link and then the ramblings
[00:11:43] <thomedy> in the header it is weird
[00:12:00] <thomedy> clicking once is good .. clicking 2x is not so good
[00:13:31] <thomedy> by the way this is jus t asimple site... nothing complicated
[00:13:52] <smill> who knows, could have something to do with the drupal crap running on top of it
[00:14:22] <thomedy> its not a drupal set up.. i only do drupal a little...
[00:14:36] <thomedy> now at least this i sjsut a striaght css, js and html
[00:14:42] <thomedy> there is a druapl sub site
[00:14:50] <thomedy> but it has nothing to do with the front page
[00:14:58] <thomedy> its a dummy demo
[00:16:57] <thomedy> any thoughts
[00:18:46] <thomedy> iam  really trying to avoid making this in pure js mostly cuz i dont wnat to think and thats what s great about jquery
[00:27:27] <granden> How would I add an listener to listen for event changes on a checkbox? Want to know when the user clicks it  to either check it or uncheck it.
[00:28:14] <b2l> smill, http://jsfiddle.net/KNypr/22/
[00:28:20] <b2l> it works this way
[00:28:56] <b2l> the part for extracting the section is not really cool, maybe you can have an attribute just for this so we don't have to use those ugly string manipulation
[00:29:08] <smill> granden you'd do something like $(function() { $('div.section-name').find('input:checkbox').change(function(){ if (this.checked) { alert("poop!");}});});
[00:30:03] <b2l> granden, smill : to test if the checkbox is checked, use the jquery selector: $(this).is(":checked")
[00:30:16] <b2l> it return a real boolean (better for if statement :) )
[00:30:38] <granden> smill: Cool, but I got specific IDs on all checkboxes. So I guess I just could do $('#c1').change(function(){alert('poop'); });
[00:30:41] <granden> ;)
[00:30:44] <granden> ?
[00:31:04] <granden> b2l: Great, then I could use that in the change function then, to see if they checked or unchecked it.
[00:31:11] <b2l> yes
[00:31:12] <granden> Thanks both of you!
[00:31:38] <smill> np :)
[00:32:58] <Engin> I knwo you guys will be biased but is it just me or ExtJS is way too restrictive... I tried to embed a captcha to a form.. it turns out it didn't generate a <form> element for its forms (as it uses Ajax there) and third part captcha can't be used without forms... so I need to do some hacking... so what's the point ?
[00:33:09] <Engin> I love jQ so much but it lacks UI components.
[00:33:38] <smill> i have a very similar question about checkboxes, i'm trying to code it so that when i check a checkbox it checks all the child checkboxes of the element
[00:34:59] <b2l> smill, http://jsfiddle.net/KNypr/22/
[00:35:20] <smill> b21: thx!
[00:35:22] <b2l> np
[00:35:32] <b2l> you didn't see it the first time :)
[00:36:16] <noahs> .
[00:36:50] <smill> b21: :)
[00:38:26] <smill> b21: i decided that way was overly complicated since each checkbox that I need to check will be in the same div, how could I just say that for a particular checkbox with a class of 'some-name' to check every checkbox in the same div as it?
[00:39:10] <KarateKip3> smill: give all them checkboxes the same name
[00:39:17] <smill> b21: nvm i can figure it out from what you gave me
[00:39:31] <b2l> smill, ok if you need help, just ask
[00:48:27] <smill> b21: ok I have this http://jsfiddle.net/WBh2P/ but it checks all boxes, i don't know what to add to keep it within the current div
[00:53:20] <KarateKip3> smill: have a look overhere buddy http://jsfiddle.net/WBh2P/1/
[00:54:14] <smill> karatekip3: yes?
[00:56:14] <smill> karatekip3: your code is just mine with one line commented out, i dont get it
[00:57:50] <KarateKip3> smill: that's the line which causes all the checkboxes to be checked
[00:58:04] <KarateKip3> smill: wat exactly r u trying to do?
[00:58:31] <smill> karatekip3: do you see how checkboxes for item1 and item2 are in a div class="section"?
[00:58:44] <smill> karatekip3: then checkbox 3 is in its own div class="section"
[00:59:02] <smill> karatekip3: i want to click the checkbox that says 'check boxes 1 and 2' and have it check all checkboxes in its current div
[01:09:01] <b2l> smill, http://jsfiddle.net/WBh2P/2/
[01:09:34] <smill> b21: thanks very much
[01:09:39] <b2l> you're welcome
[01:16:09] <thinkswan> Hello from a Canadian in Malaysia!
[01:16:10] <thinkswan> I'm trying to match all text between '<section id="blog">' and '</section>' of a webpage's source (multiline), currently using regex = /<section id="blog">(.*?)<\/section>/im, but it's returning null
[01:16:18] <thinkswan> Any ideas what's wrong with my regex?
[01:17:19] <Engin> are you sure you are in the rigth channel ?
[01:19:46] <thinkswan> Well, I figured it was javascript related :/
[01:19:55] <Engin> $('#blog').text()
[01:21:07] <thinkswan> haha, I guess I should have seen that response coming
[01:21:40] <thinkswan> the source is being returned from an ajax request, so I can't use jquery select from it
[01:21:43] <thinkswan> I'll keep trying, thanks
[01:21:56] <Engin> you can load it into a non-visible dom and do that
[01:27:11] <noregret> what is a good/most used upload plugin ?
[01:29:04] <fabioportieri> hi
[01:31:14] <fabioportieri> i have this issue with colorbox: clicking a link i open a colorbox with a button on it, now clicking that button (with inline href) it should be open another colorbox with a form, what it does, instead, is appending a get request, like GET http://bartendersart.xonex.web/prova <-- note that "prova" is the id, but colorbox append the url too messing things up
[01:40:10] <fabioportieri> anybody expert with colorbox?
[01:43:13] <fabioportieri> i have a button inside another colorbox, but when i click it and try to open another colorbox with a form, it prepends the url to the inlined href ??
[01:43:42] <noregret> what is a good/most used ajax upload plugin ?
[01:54:28] <b2l> fabioportieri, can you make a jsfiddle to explain your problems
[01:55:52] <fabioportieri> i will, my issue is that inline seems to not be working for nested colorbox, in my example it prepends the url to the inlined id
[02:04:08] <KarateKip3> can the drag & drop feature drag bookmarks from firefox and place them on the web page?
[02:05:48] <wathek> Hi everybody
[02:05:48] <wathek> any idea why the height of the body tag isn't the whole page height http://www-test.lacriee.com/
[02:07:21] <KarateKip3> wathek: u asked that question b4
[02:07:41] <wathek> KarateKip3, yes :(
[02:08:03] <wathek> KarateKip3, it was 11 hours ago
[02:08:40] <wathek> KarateKip3, and I still cannot figure out why the height of the body isn't the whole page's height
[02:09:22] <KarateKip3> wathek: no, i mean just a while ago in #css
[02:09:31] <KarateKip3> wathek: but i don't understand ur question exactly
[02:09:34] <wathek> KarateKip3, oh yes
[02:09:42] <wathek> KarateKip3, ok do you have firebug ?
[02:10:01] <KarateKip3> yeah, i'm using firebug right now as we speak
[02:10:26] <wathek> KarateKip3, ok when you hover the body tag it makes a part of the page blued
[02:11:19] <KarateKip3> wathek: yeah
[02:11:40] <wathek> KarateKip3, you see that the blued area isn't the whole page
[02:11:52] <wathek> KarateKip3, here's a screenshot http://picpaste.com/Capture_du_2012-12-27_11_11_13-i4Y1rmJz.png
[02:15:44] <KarateKip3> wathek: when i put my cursor there on the bottom part of the screen and click, i see a lot of garbage, it starts with "<html class="js" lang="fr" xmlns:xsd="http://www...." so the answer should be somewhere in there
[02:16:18] <KarateKip3> wathek: it's one of the attributes of the <html>-tag
[02:16:27] <wathek> huh ?!
[02:16:45] <wathek> KarateKip3, I don't see what you mean
[02:22:58] <KarateKip3> wathek: hold on, i'm making screenshot 4u
[02:23:39] <wathek> KarateKip3, ok thanks
[02:24:57] <KarateKip3> wathek: have a look overhere: http://picpaste.com/pics/5bb7cd4e82f7feb19b37ba3216674f2d.1356603872.jpg
[02:25:29] <KarateKip3> wathek: You see that blue line?
[02:25:41] <wathek> KarateKip3, yes
[02:26:05] <KarateKip3> wathek: that blue line appears when I put my cursor on it. That's what Firebug does.
[02:26:43] <wathek> KarateKip3, let me try to get it
[02:26:46] <KarateKip3> wathek: now in the bottom of your screen you can see what is causing the stuff that appear inside the blue lines
[02:28:36] <KarateKip3> wathek: if you want to know something about a checkbox, you turn on firebug, press the button in the upper left corner and then you put the cursor on the checkbox that is causing the problem. This is exactly the same. I put my cursor on the blank space at the bottom of the page.
[02:29:12] <KarateKip3> wathek: the blank space is what you want to examine
[02:29:57] <wathek> I see
[02:30:02] <wathek> I'm looking
[02:32:19] <KarateKip3> if you put your cursor on the blank space that you want to examine, you will see the blue line around it. Now press the left mouse button (in France, maybe the right mouse button) and then you will see that the <html> tag will be highlighted.
[02:32:29] <KarateKip3> wathek: there's something in there, but I can't figure out what
[02:35:28] <KarateKip3> wathek: for these kinds of problems you can use the following debugging technique: remove all components 1 by 1 to see when the error is gone.
[02:39:21] <KarateKip3> wathek: it's somewhere in the div id=page'
[02:39:39] <KarateKip3> wathek: if you remove that DIV your problem is solved
[02:45:03] <charas> I have a <ul> with multiple <li><a></a></li> inside it. I am changing the color of the link which is selected. I use the addclass function to do that with css but this is keeps the css intact, while I want to make sure once you move to some other link, the class is removed from previous link
[02:48:36] <KarateKip3> charas: why can't u use a:hover ?
[02:49:00] <charas> it's not hover. I am adding ".selected" and changing the background color of the link
[02:59:13] <fabioportieri> another colorbox issue: rel attribute doesn't work to me: http://pastie.org/5583721

[04:11:21] <sheilablackrose> i have a stinrg of ids. im trying to split it using $mainCheckBox[index].split(',');  - [roblem it works only if the string has more than one id.

[04:29:13] <netAction> Hi! I have to start client side functions when events on the server happen.
[04:29:33] <netAction> Is there an example for something like this?
[04:32:25] <netAction> Chat clients should have this functionality.
[04:42:23] <EweR> hello
[04:48:14] <squeakytoy> there should be an .onenter function, just like .click :S
[04:49:19] <noregret> xdjuj_: does it support ajax/multiupload ?
[05:02:23] <John_____> Hiho. I have this short code http://pastebin.com/q6MzRkaz .. i successfully get echos from php file, but I always get The security code you entered did not match. Please try again.
[05:06:40] <xdjuj_> noregret => http://www.uploadify.com
[05:06:54] <xdjuj_> There's also http://www.plupload.com
[05:07:11] <xdjuj_> But somes find that it's not really "well coded"
[05:08:21] <noregret> xdjuj_: wth.. uploadify uses flash ?!
[05:09:04] <noregret> xdjuj_: i'm starting to continue trying with http://fineuploader.com
[05:09:15] <noregret> anything but flash..
[05:09:24] <xdjuj_> noregret there's 2 version of uploadify
[05:09:38] <xdjuj_> Just read the doc :)
[05:10:04] <John_____> Hiho. I have this short code http://pastebin.com/q6MzRkaz .. i successfully get echos from php file, but I always get The security code you entered did not match. Please try again.
[05:10:12] <xdjuj_> john maybe you should try the official example like => http://www.plupload.com
[05:10:14] <xdjuj_> Oups
[05:10:19] <xdjuj_> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:10:31] <xdjuj_> request.done(function(msg) {
[05:10:37] <xdjuj_> request.fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus) {
[05:10:44] <xdjuj_> var request = $.ajax({
[05:11:34] <xdjuj_> John_____ you can also have a look here
[05:11:35] <xdjuj_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5004233/jquery-ajax-post-example
[05:11:44] <xdjuj_> success: function ==> blablabla
[05:11:50] <xdjuj_> error: function ==> blablabal
[05:11:59] <noregret> xdjuj_: the other one is uploadfive, is that what you mwan
[05:12:01] <noregret> mean
[05:13:49] <noregret> John_____: if you console.log(html), what do you get
[05:14:39] <xdjuj_> John is in the "success" part
[05:15:06] <xdjuj_> If he wants to catch error, he has to work with error: function
[05:15:11] <xdjuj_> Not with success
[05:15:22] <noregret> xdjuj_: uploadifive isnot free
[05:15:44] <xdjuj_> HTML5 is not supported by all browsers :)
[05:15:51] <xdjuj_> You've to choose
[05:16:28] <noregret> success functino is called when data is returned from the server, disregarding the content. his issue is with 'html'
[05:16:33] <xdjuj_> Uploadify is a jQuery plugin, using Flash for uploading large files. That's great, and work everywhere
[05:16:39] <xdjuj_> You can't only use HTML5
[05:16:55] <noregret> xdjuj_: trying using it from linux clients
[05:17:03] <noregret> and not everybody got flash there
[05:17:10] <xdjuj_> Try to use HTML5 with IE :)
[05:17:12] <noregret> and you dn't want to force someone to have it
[05:17:22] <xdjuj_> And at this time, IE is much more used than Linux...
[05:17:31] <noregret> what
[05:18:48] <xdjuj_> [14:06]  <xdjuj_> There's also http://www.plupload.com
[05:19:03] <John_____> Hmmm... i have to go afk for sec now. Will check it in 10 mins.
[05:32:00] <invisib> Can anyone help me? I'm trying to get this mobile dropdown menu to work, but it keeps bouncing. When I try to stopPropagation it doesn't seem to help. Any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/dmLNx/1/ (works until you resize window and try it, then it queues up every pixel the window was resized)
[05:37:44] <invisib> 800 idlers
[05:55:14] <xdjuj_> About 800 yes :)
[06:11:02] <raj> is it possible to make a rightclick menu that looks natural to each OS?
[06:18:46] <Pilate> yeah raj, you probably shouldnt though because its NOT natural
[06:20:52] <raj> Pilate, what do you mean?
[06:28:38] <fabioportieri> what's the most commonly used drop down plugin?
[06:33:59] <John_____> http://pastebin.com/q6MzRkaz
[06:34:26] <John_____> i dont know how could my problem be that "html"
[06:38:52] <shoky> John_____ use dataType: 'text'
[06:39:05] <shoky> and console.log(html)
[06:39:06] <John_____> =) will try.
[06:39:28] <John_____> well.. im getting echo 'success'; in my php file
[06:39:36] <shoky> console.log(html)
[06:39:37] <John_____> so i have to parse html string ? or smth ?
[06:39:39] <John_____> ok
[06:40:01] <shoky> 'success' doesn't look like an html string..
[06:41:03] <jeffsmykil> Best templating language for mobile?  I will be pre-compiling
[06:44:24] <fabioportieri> any suggestion for a good drop down menu plugin?
[06:44:42] <jeffsmykil> have you tried bootstrap?
[06:46:04] <jeffsmykil> fabioportieri: have you tried bootstrap?
[06:46:40] <fabioportieri> nop, looking at it, thanks
[06:47:30] <fabioportieri> it's jquery ui theme?
[06:47:44] <fabioportieri> it looks better than other themes :| cool link
[06:47:55] <jeffsmykil> its pretty great
[06:48:00] <jeffsmykil> especially for rapid prototyping
[06:53:18] <guybrushsantiago> Need to do a matching widget like this one -> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71527137/screenshots/IgRpOXoELkJ.png Any ideas?
[06:53:41] <jeffsmykil> yikes
[06:53:50] <jeffsmykil> looks like fun
[06:53:59] <jeffsmykil> do you have to do the physicis of the connectors?
[06:54:23] <guybrushsantiago> jeffsmykil: Sure does, but looks like a hell of a lot of pain too... I have nothing, no :S
[06:54:42] <guybrushsantiago> I was kinda hoping there was something I could use out of the box
[06:54:43] <jeffsmykil> i would probably plead with the ux guy to alter it so you could use jquery ui sprtable on either side
[06:55:04] <jeffsmykil> looks like a fun project, if there is no deadline
[06:55:10] <jeffsmykil> im assuming y ou have a deadline
[06:55:20] <guybrushsantiago> yeah, like that project exists in any universe hahahha
[06:55:43] <jeffsmykil> what browser support do you need
[06:55:57] <guybrushsantiago> HTML5 is OK
[06:56:13] <b-ot> guybrushsantiago http://www.jsplumb.org/jquery/demo.html
[06:56:16] <guybrushsantiago> FF, Chrome and IE9+ I think
[06:56:31] <jeffsmykil> oh look at that
[06:56:36] <jeffsmykil> he just saved your life
[06:56:54] <guybrushsantiago> jeffsmykil: Hhahahah I think he did
[06:57:01] <guybrushsantiago> thanks b-ot!
[06:57:20] * jeffsmykil bookmarks for when his ux guy goes insane
[06:58:00] <noregret> what ajax upload plugin is recommended ?
[06:58:27] <jeffsmykil> guybrushsantiago: looks like a fun project, have fun
[07:00:20] <guybrushsantiago> jeffsmykil: b-ot: Thanks to both! Apparently the client has the JS for it :-) it is a pretty cool project actually, yes ;-)
[07:00:24] <guybrushsantiago> have fun guys
[07:00:48] <guybrushsantiago> jsPlumb is deifinitely going into my repertoir, though
[07:06:44] <guybrushsantiago> noregret: http://fineuploader.com
[07:09:33] <noregret> guybrushsantiago: do you use it ?
[07:09:43] <carnau> Hello, I'm using Tabs Widget and I need to change some content on the page when one of the tabs is set active. Is there any way to do this? There is an event called activate, but I'm really bad with js and don't know how can I use it (even reading the examples)
[07:10:30] <raj> I wanna add up the width of each element in a class, what's the cleanest way to do this?
[07:11:58] <carnau> the event is: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-activate
[07:13:00] <BillCriswell> raj: var width; $('.foo').each(function(){ width += $(this).width(); });
[07:14:49] <raj> BillCriswell, k, I thought there might be a one-liner for it
[07:15:03] <BillCriswell> That is a one liner. ;)
[07:15:09] <raj> haha
[07:16:15] <BillCriswell> var width = $('.foo').map(function(){ return $(this).width() }).reduce(function(a,b){ return a + b; }, 0); maybe?
[07:19:43] <noregret> guybrushsantiago: I included all js scripts in client/js and I am getting JS errors "ReferenceError: qq is not defined"
[07:19:51] <BillCriswell> raj: var width = $.map($('div'), function(){ return $(this).width() }).reduce(function(a,b){ return a + b; }, 0); worked.
[07:20:22] <guybrushsantiago> noregret: I have used it in the past, but I can't recall having that error
[07:20:23] <raj> thank you sir
[07:20:28] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:25:06] <noregret> guybrushsantiago: looks like the final package is not free
[07:26:52] <BillCriswell> raj: I just saw that .reduce() only seems to exist in IE9+ so you might want to just .each it.
[07:27:03] <raj> k
[07:27:07] <raj> thank you
[07:28:36] <John_____> Guys pls.. i tried all your advances, but couldnt make it work. I have this http://pastebin.com/q6MzRkaz as javascript file, that sends status msg into div in my form and this : http://pastebin.com/pGc0ZbGh as rip of my php file.  Im always getting "The security code you entered did not match. Please try again msg." I tried console.log and that request.fail.
[07:29:29] <John_____> I even asked on stackoverflow and they told me that script is right.. -_-
[07:29:51] <BillCriswell> raj: No problem.
[07:30:45] <shoky> John_____  what did console.log(html)  log to the console?

[07:37:44] <unblockgames> hi all
[07:40:13] <unblockgames> im using the jquery load feature to implement a live search but im having an issue because if the user types a space into the input field, my script does not encode it for url passage. so when i pull it from the url it is messed up, is there a way to fix this?
[07:44:58] <John_____> console shows me "success"
[07:45:23] <John_____> it succesfully sends informations to php file and returns success
[07:46:05] <John_____> but i need to take that value and if it is succes, then show in my div "Success"
[07:50:12] <timwis> Hey guys
[07:51:11] <timwis> I'm trying to add some javascript to some old software that uses a lot of messy, in-line javascript. Somewhere in there, it's calling focus() on a DOM element that doesn't exist. Is there a way to log those kinds of events so I can track it down?
[07:58:09] <snover> timwis: (function () { var oldFocus = Element.prototype.focus; Element.prototype.focus = function () { console.trace(); oldFocus.apply(this, arguments); } })();
[07:58:23] <snover> it’s not an event, it’s a method call
[07:58:42] <timwis> snover: You're a genius. Thanks!
[08:00:55] <John____> when its succes
[08:01:00] <John____> im getting this weird thing
[08:01:02] <John____> "success\r\n\r\n                                                     "
[08:01:08] <John____> -_-
[08:01:23] <shoky> there you go
[08:02:14] <John____> but there is not line breaking in my echo -_-
[08:02:21] <John____> not even senceless spaces.
[08:02:26] <John____> so i have to use that .trim thing ?
[08:02:54] <shoky> that'd work

[08:05:07] <carnau> When I initialize the tabs widget with the activate callback specified, where and how can I call the function?Like this:   $("#tabs-hit_w").tabs({activate:function(event, ui) });};
[08:05:29] <timwis> snover: I've never used Element before - do I have to loop through all the elements and apply that? Executing that at load doesn't seem to have an effect
[08:06:01] <shoky> carnau: you don't call that function (unless you really want to..), jquery-ui does
[08:06:05] <John____> ye. it will remove whitespace, but not those senceless \r \n
[08:06:16] <shoky> carnau: that's why its called a callback.  what you can do is set the 'active' option
[08:06:51] <carnau> shoelessone, hmmmm, so how can I launch a function when a tab is pressed?
[08:07:24] <shoky> carnau: your callback will be called when a tab is activated..
[08:07:40] <snover> timwis: Try using HTMLElement.prototype instead of Element.prototype, it depends on which browser you’re using
[08:07:48] <carnau> I just want to hide some html content if some tab is pressed, but don't know how to do it
[08:07:53] <timwis> ah, okay
[08:08:15] <snover> it may even only work in Chrome
[08:08:17] <snover> hard to say for sure
[08:08:25] <shoky> carnau: then put some code in the callback..   .tabs({activate:function(event,ui) { ... do stuff here ... })
[08:09:01] <snover> kind of depends upon how the native engine composes element object prototypes
[08:09:13] <carnau> shoky, interesting, that's what I was trying with no luck. I'll dig on it. many thanks
[08:09:52] <rabbi1> Can i navigate to a div using class name. or should i go with name attribute having same id names ?
[08:12:10] <John____> Man... any idea why Im getting that "success\r\n\r\n                                                     " thing, when my echo is simple as echo 'success'; and im not using any other scripts ? :(
[08:16:53] <shoky> John____ maybe if you pastebin the full php me or someone will see

[08:18:29] <shoky> are you using some php framework?
[08:18:46] <shoky> well, guess not
[08:18:57] <John____> aha. nvm. solved.
[08:19:22] <John____> didnt noticed in pspad that i had like 40 blank lines after ?>
[08:19:39] <shoky> derp
[08:19:51] <John____> dont even know how they appeared there.
[08:20:19] <rabbi1> can anybody share me the use of .clone() of input fields if you have it already ?

[08:20:48] <rabbi1> *can anybody share me the jsfiddle, showing use of .clone() of input fields if you have it already ?
[08:21:18] <shoky> rabbi1:  var clone = $('#myInput').clone();

[08:36:48] <opalepatrick> anyone know if there is a way to pause the last slide with nivo-slider?
[08:38:57] <EHLOVader> opalepatrick: search for nivo and no or stop loop
[08:39:10] <EHLOVader> http://webdesignandsuch.com/make-the-jquery-nivo-slider-stop-after-one-loop/ < one set of possible solutions
[08:40:13] <opalepatrick> thanks EHLOVader - looking now
[08:40:20] <rmill> So, there's a `slideshowEnd` event
[08:40:53] <opalepatrick> thing is rmill - I want a pause, but not a stop
[08:41:34] * rmill shrugs
[08:41:34] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:41:35] <EHLOVader> I think that pause and stop are only different on video
[08:41:37] <rmill> Not sure, then
[08:41:53] * rmill has never used nivoslider
[08:42:10] <EHLOVader> although if you consider "stop" to be returning to the start even in a slideshow, then yes, that is what you have happening
[08:42:21] <EHLOVader> option 2 on that post may help...
[08:42:28] <EHLOVader> looks like it orders the slides backwards though
[08:45:37] <Krambiorix>  i want to get my session variable $_SESSION['currentuserid'] in jquery, what's the best way to do that in JQUERY?
[08:46:25] <opalepatrick> thanks EHLOVader
[08:49:16] <EHLOVader> tbh though opalepatrick not sure that will work, like rmill said, they haven't documented any of the events anywhere
[09:01:09] <lucalenardi> Hi all. Is there a way to programmatically set the a jquery.mobile button to "active" without messing with adding and removing classes to the generated elements? I've tried with the trivial addClass("ui-btn-active") to the button, but this came after the default add-remove of the same class and so the active state is always removed.
[09:09:26] <amcsi> hi
[09:10:27] <amcsi> in IE7 (maybe in IE8 too), the click event in my script seems to give back the mouse's current position instead of the position the mouse was when the user clicked. What may cause this problem?
[09:15:39] <rindolf> Hi all.
[09:18:20] <AL13N> does anyone know what is the best lightbox thingie? i tried prettyPhoto, but it wasn't really what i wanted
[09:18:35] <AL13N> there's a huge amount of them that i can't really find what i want
[09:19:15] <AL13N> no social media crap or gallery; and i need a title and a download button and the links i want to programmatorically pass
[09:20:07] <amcsi> is it normal for IE to report the mouse's current position instead of the click position on a click event? meaning in case of lag, I'll get a completly wrong mouse position report?
[09:21:55] <opalepatrick> its true EHLOVader - I did use the slider previously and remember being a bit dissapointed that I couldn't do a pause. Anyway thnaks for the help... having a mooch around
[09:24:38] <velcrobots> can someone help with the ScrollTo plugin?  I am having difficulty with the syntax.  I have a container div with a class of "scrollme" that I want to scroll.  Inside are several other divs, all with IDs of months like "#jan" or "apr".  On my menu I have links to these ids.  But confused as to where the jquery line goes.  In this demo he's got it in the title, which I can't see as how to do it
[09:24:39] <velcrobots> http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[09:25:51] <zoned> i've got an image with a dynamic height (%age). is there a way i can write a JS event to tell me when this image has been scaled?
[09:27:31] <danheberden> zoned, like, once or if it's _ever_ scaled?
[09:27:44] <zoned> every time its scaled, like when you resize the browser
[09:27:50] <danheberden> either way - on the load event of the image or resize of it/its container/
[09:27:53] <danheberden> or the window
[09:28:10] <danheberden> so if the window resizes, check the dimensions of the image
[09:29:03] <zoned> every time the window resizes the image isn't necessarily scaled…. let's say i'm doing this for about 100 images in a gallery, does that code scale? no pun intended
[09:29:27] <danheberden> are all the images the same size?
[09:29:40] <zoned> no, but they all have dynamic heights.
[09:29:44] <ShawnRisk> if I use http://jsfiddle.net/NmvA9/3944/ does the jquery code have to be in the body section of the html?  If so, how would I make this code work if I had the jquery code in a js file?
[09:29:53] <zoned> (i wouldn't be able to set them all to the same height)
[09:30:18] <danheberden> zoned - perhaps more, like, if you know you have 100 images and your document.body is X pixels wide or tall, you know you need to do something
[09:30:45] <danheberden> either way - checking for the resize event on window is the only way you'd ever know that happened
[09:31:18] <danheberden> and either way, you'd be checking the dimensions of 100+ images - so perhaps a creative workaround could be thought up
[09:34:06] <zoned> danheberden: what i ultimately need to do is to set the dimensions of the images in pixels, and not percent. but i want them to be 100% height of their container. and the container is defined as height: calc(99% - 100px)
[09:34:39] <amcsi> is it normal for IE to not hang when a click event is triggered, until all click events are resolved, and until then, not even allow to move the mouse?
[09:35:21] <zoned> so every time the window is resized, if an image is resized, i want to calculate its actual dimensions (pixels) and set them. unless there's a better way
[09:35:52] <amcsi> I am using a specific framework at the moment, but I want to make sure whether this is an IE problem or a problem with the framework (such as using setTimeout) before digging into the framework's source code
[09:36:17] <danheberden> none comes to mind unless you can get more creative with your css
[09:36:58] <danheberden> e.g. a container with the image at 100% and another div on top as a mask somehow so that it's always centered? i have no idea if that could work or not
[09:37:07] <zoned> danheberden: so would you say every time the window is resized, i just check the actual height of the container, set every images height = to that? would this be slow?
[09:37:17] <danheberden> but that's the only synapse firing of that happened
[09:37:50] <danheberden> zoned - depends, that's a lot of resizing for the browser. try it and see?
[09:45:06] <tina> hello. i am trying to target a span whose class is the same as an id in an each() statement. so far i have this but it's not working. i'm assuming it's wrong. $('.labels span[class=' + $(this).id + ']').text('$' + markup);
[09:46:06] <zoned> $(this).attr("id")
[09:47:50] <Swimming_Bird> tina, you're much better off doing $('.labels .'+$(this).attr("id"))
[09:48:41] <tina> thanks swimming_bird. what's the difference? it's a bit confusing.
[09:49:18] <danheberden> also `this.id` is the same as $(this).atter('id')
[09:49:22] <Swimming_Bird> for one [class=someclass] only matches if the span has no other classes. for the other factor it's much less efficent. much faster to use the built in
[09:49:28] <danheberden> since no browsers assign the prop `id` differently
[09:49:37] <danheberden> so you could $( '.labels .' + this.id )
[09:49:44] <Swimming_Bird> yah @danheberden
[09:50:05] <danheberden> or before your each, do `var labels = $( '.labels' )`
[09:50:20] <danheberden> and then in your each, so you aren't finding it every time, do `labels.find( '.' + this.id )`
[09:50:45] <tina> oh ok awesome. thank you so much. it works. :)
[09:53:16] <Creesch> Hi I am currently working on a userscript that also utilizes jquery, I have been storing my data with localstorage but have run into some limitations. So I have been looking into indexedDB, so far I have found one jquery plugin in development that improves indexedDB usage. Are there any others I might be overlooking?
[09:53:44] <ShawnRisk> if I use http://jsfiddle.net/NmvA9/3944/ does the jquery code have to be in the body section of the html?  If so, how would I make this code work if I had the jquery code in a js file?
[09:53:48] <danheberden> Creesch: i know there's a few mentioned on modernizr's website
[09:53:57] <danheberden> as polyfils for localstorage/featuers/etc
[09:55:05] <danheberden> ShawnRisk: you need only to include the script file using <script> tags like you would any other js file
[09:55:10] <danheberden> it's just javascript :)
[09:55:45] <Creesch> Ok I might have to look into that
[09:55:48] <danheberden> since you are passing an anonymous function into $ (those last three lines in your js) it will be executed when the DOM is ready to go
[09:56:08] <danheberden> so regardless of it's place on your page, as long as the browser knows to, you know, go look at it and parse it
[09:56:10] <danheberden> you're set
[09:56:32] <ShawnRisk> danheberden: I know but what I am doing is <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/youtubevideo.js"></script> in my live site.  Would I need to include .load or .ready in the js file to make this work?
[09:57:05] <danheberden> $(function(){ /* code */ }); is the same as $(document).ready(function(){ /* code */ });
[09:57:08] <danheberden> which you are already doing
[09:57:28] <ShawnRisk> danheberden: okay that is good to know
[09:57:29] <danheberden> but yes, you need to attach a callback to document ready before you bind events
[09:57:45] <ShawnRisk> danheberden: yep I thought so
[09:59:43] <amcsi> I am using a specific framework at the moment, but I want to make sure whether this is an IE problem or a problem with the framework (such as using setTimeout) before digging into the framework's source code
[10:01:18] <danheberden> amcsi: what properties are you using to get the x/y?
[10:03:06] <zoned> how can i create an object like this… var item = ".item";    var events = { "click " + item : "clickedItem" };
[10:03:47] <Creesch> danheberden: indeed found a few, seems though that most of the wrappers are still in development
[10:03:58] <Creesch> might be better of storing stuff in localstorage in json format then
[10:06:32] <zoned> without eval, of course
[10:07:33] <danheberden> var events = {}; events[ "click" + item ] = "clickedItem";
[10:07:36] <danheberden> zoned ^
[10:09:50] <zoned> ahh, i was trying that without the initial events = {}; thanks
[10:12:30] <velcrobots> how do i grab the href from an <a> tag using "this?"
[10:12:45] <velcrobots> this is giving me undefined
[10:12:46] <velcrobots> var myHash = jQuery(this).attr("href");
[10:12:48] <rmill> $( this ).attr( 'href' );
[10:13:03] <velcrobots> do double quotes matter?
[10:13:19] <rmill> velcrobots: if `this` is giving you `undefined`
[10:13:33] <rmill> then, something else is wrong.
[10:14:01] <rmill> and no, there is no difference between double and single quotes, in this case.
[10:15:14] <velcrobots> what else could be wrong?  a syntax thing?  a sample link looks like this: <li class="jan"><a href="#jan" name="jan">january</a></li>
[10:15:37] <danheberden> velcrobots: what is the $( this ).attr... in?
[10:15:43] <rmill> velcrobots: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/Z3Phj/
[10:15:53] <rmill> Also a good question.

[10:19:32] <danheberden> we should make b-ot do betting
[10:19:45] <danheberden> so we can bet on the problem at the beginning
[10:20:00] * danheberden forks repo
[10:20:25] <zoned> is naturalWidth/naturalHeight cross browser? i can't even find it on caniuse
[10:20:52] <rmill> lol wat
[10:21:04] <rmill> `natural` Height?
[10:21:43] <danheberden> that div is hot, but i heard its height isn't natural - it got implants
[10:22:04] <zoned> image.naturalWidth acceases the width of the image response, i.e. the actual dimensions of the file
[10:22:46] <rmill> velcrobots: you're targetting the <li>
[10:22:53] <zoned> in a responsive design all your images end up with implants :P
[10:23:03] <rmill> so the `this` isn't the a, but the <li>
[10:23:23] <velcrobots> oh. duh.  so can i do "this a"
[10:23:24] <velcrobots> or no
[10:23:32] <danheberden> zoned suprisingly, a google search yielded this: http://arunprasad.wordpress.com/2008/08/26/naturalwidth-and-naturalheight-for-image-element-in-internet-explorer/
[10:23:35] <rmill> velcrobots: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/ffAsR/9/
[10:23:37] <rmill> something like that
[10:23:50] <rmill> $( this ).find( 'a' ).attr( 'href' );
[10:24:01] <rmill> Or, you could just target the <a>'s
[10:24:24] <danheberden> though the css uses li.active
[10:24:30] <rmill> e.g: `jQuery("#nm12-menu li a").click( function ( a )...`
[10:24:54] <danheberden> so then you'd have to either change the css or $(this).closest('li').addClass('active')
[10:25:40] <velcrobots> whoa - there's a "closest"?
[10:25:41] <velcrobots> fml
[10:25:47] <velcrobots> i need to learn this stuff
[10:25:56] <velcrobots> anyway your 'find' code works perfectly
[10:25:58] <velcrobots> appreciate it
[10:26:05] <tw2113> learning takes time
[10:26:10] <tw2113> so just keep working through your tasks
[10:26:22] <velcrobots> yeah that's what i've been doing.  trial by fire!

[10:27:42] <DigitallyBorn> Is there a helper method to deserialize form data from a string that I created using .serialize() ?
[10:28:37] <psilo3> Are these not equivalent?  http://pastie.org/5585288  (The only difference is line 3 vs. line 9) -- Only the second version works as expected.
[10:32:34] <DigitallyBorn> To be more exact in what I'm doing ... I want to save a user's input into a cookie and restore it when they come back.
[10:32:55] <DigitallyBorn> Is there a better way to do that?
[10:40:46] <danheberden> psilo3: as you aren't inside of a callback/anonymous function (in the first code snippet) `this` is probably something else

[12:13:32] <velcrobots> ok so anyone know how i can make this scroll horizontally instead of vertically?  using ScrollTo plugin.  need to somehow get the monthly divs floating.  not sure how the overflows are screwing things up (have to make lower right quadrant big enough to see it in action) http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/ffAsR/10/
[12:19:06] <kcjpop> hello
[12:25:15] <tw2113> hi
[12:25:26] <tw2113> damn, mist kcjpop
[12:25:29] <tw2113> missed*
[12:37:13] <snollux> Hello hello. How can I get a menu to appear _above_ / "on" an image with Jquery/CSS?
[12:37:59] <snollux> like hovering over an image will make a little menu appear above that image
[12:38:13] <akacja> Hello, could some one help me to fix this http://jsfiddle.net/nSHpn/ i like to when the textarea is empty return false and when its over 200 characters return false also
[12:38:24] <rindolf> snollux: hi.
[12:38:37] <rindolf> snollux: use :hover or onmouse something.
[12:38:51] <rindolf> snollux: and there should be a jqUI plugin for that.
[12:38:57] <rindolf> jQueryUI.
[12:39:02] <snollux> rindolf: thank you! I can do the hover part just fine, it's just the positioning/depth I'm struggling with
[12:39:29] <rindolf> snollux: ah, this may be CSS stuff.
[13:14:47] <dankest> I'm using sortable and connect_with in the latest jQuery UI, and I'm getting a lot of flickering when I'm dragging elements.  The flickering stops when I sotp using connect_with.  Has anyone experienced this issue?
[13:22:17] <anew> any reason why i get "document.readyState: interactive" like 1000 times on page load?
[13:52:41] <coldhead> anew: you must have some code somewhere that is console.log()ing that message
[13:52:41] <b-ot> coldhead, you have 2 new messages, say “read” to me when you wish to read them.
[13:53:00] <anew> rly... hmmm
[13:53:16] <anew> coldhead that's the only way to produce them ?
[13:54:05] <coldhead> the only way i can think of
[13:54:13] <coldhead> it's worded like a custom error message anyway
[13:55:31] <coldhead> anew: can you grep your code for "document.readyState"
[13:56:04] <tw2113> ack
[13:56:10] <tw2113> ack!
[13:59:33] * tw2113 acks coldhead 
[14:03:23] <anew> coldhead that's the thing, it's not even my code, it's coming from chrome
[14:03:47] <anew> chrome-extension://hbdkkfheckcdppiaiabobmennhijkknn/jsr/en_content-pagespeed.js:1
[14:07:05] <coldhead> it's coming from an extension you have isntalled
[14:10:45] <Xabster> I use $('#ta').html(data); and it seems to only work once
[14:10:51] <Xabster> ta is the id of a textarea
[14:11:07] <Xabster> data is some data that comes from a php file
[14:11:22] <Xabster> it works the first time but then nothing happens next time i click the button
[14:16:09] <anew> Unexpected token <  this error, but i dont see < anywhere ?
[14:16:23] <tripflex> i've got a php script that when loaded calls a function that uses curl to get the version number from a website.  I want to use ajax and jquery to add a "recheck" icon which will check the version again ... i just want to make sure i'm doing this the right way
[14:16:40] <tripflex> would it be correct to put that function inside a div
[14:16:54] <tripflex> and then use .load('mypage.php #version')
[14:17:18] <tripflex> i know this should be fairly simple but i'm just learning and want to make sure i'm doing it the right way
[14:26:30] <mikedoty> In document.ready, I make 2 ajax calls, one to /ajax1.aspx and the other to /ajax2.aspx.  Each grabs some data, json1 and json2.  I want to execute "function SomeFunction()" but only after both ajax1 and ajax2 have finished.  How should I approach this?
[14:26:58] <mikedoty> I have considered using some sort of counter (incrementing once each ajax call finishes), but I'm not sure it's the most elegant solution, and possibly not easy to maintain
[14:39:15] <laidback_01> hey, can I set arbitrary properties ?  For example, I'd like to set <a href="/here/there" value1="123" value2="456>LINK</a>  and be able to access these values from jquery.  The reason I'm doing this is that I'm usiing Template Toolkit to populate the links from an arrya -and it's the first thing to come to mind as to how to create 'Delete' links and use the id values in a post.
[14:39:30] <Tomashe> hey guys there is a way to make slideToggle direction?
[14:39:50] <MistuhKurtz> Tomashe, slideUp(); slideDown();
[14:39:56] <coldhead> laidback_01: what you have there will work
[14:40:01] <coldhead> .attr('value1')
[14:40:11] <coldhead> but better to use data attributes
[14:40:20] <MistuhKurtz> laidback_01, if you want to conform to standards use data-value1="val"
[14:40:26] <coldhead> <a data-action="delete">
[14:40:37] <coldhead> $('a').data('action') === 'delete'
[14:40:49] <sheilablackrose> hi guys if i do $('#1').addClass('.mycb').prop('checked',true);  would this effect other checkbox with the same id but different class?
[14:41:15] <MistuhKurtz> sheilablackrose, only one element with that ID may be used
[14:41:22] <coldhead> it won't affect them because all your IDs are unique
[14:41:28] <coldhead> as you've been told repeatedly :)
[14:41:29] <MistuhKurtz> and I'm not sure but I don't think the ID is allowed to start with an integer
[14:42:05] <sheilablackrose> coldhead the id is generated form the db so other category checkbox might have the same id. but th eclass is different
[14:42:59] <MistuhKurtz> well if it has the same ID then that's a problem
[14:43:13] <sheilablackrose> so adding the .addClass doesnt specify it
[14:43:16] <coldhead> don't allow that to happen, sheilablackrose
[14:43:27] <MistuhKurtz> if multiple elements have the same ID, they should be using a class instead.
[14:43:28] <tw2113> IDs MUST be unique to be valid
[14:43:34] <coldhead> if you have duplicate IDs all bets are off
[14:43:34] <sheilablackrose> coldhead :( now i have to redo the db part
[14:43:44] <sheilablackrose> roger
[14:43:48] <coldhead> you should have done it correctly the first time sheilablackrose
[14:43:50] <sheilablackrose> thanks guys
[14:43:56] <coldhead> and now you know for next time :P
[14:44:00] <tw2113> every time you duplicate markup IDs, God demotes Pluto more
[14:44:09] <coldhead> think of IDs as "primary keys" in your horrible SQL world
[14:44:09] <sheilablackrose> i was hapily doing th ebackend part
[14:44:21] <sheilablackrose> yup
[14:44:23] <sheilablackrose> i will
[14:44:24] <tw2113> think of Pluto!
[14:44:24] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[14:44:30] <sheilablackrose> ....pluto?
[14:44:40] <MistuhKurtz> Poor Pluto.
[14:44:57] <coldhead> plantary classification is just racism
[14:45:10] <tw2113> just because God hates your home planet
[14:45:20] <MistuhKurtz> racism thinly veiled as planetary classification.
[14:45:22] <coldhead> i don't blame him for that
[14:45:31] <sheilablackrose> hahahahaha
[15:11:25] <kamoricks> I want two ajax requests to execute simultaniously, but only to continue once they're both complete. Do I have something like that available?
[15:12:35] <shoky> kamoricks: $.when
[15:12:43] <shoky> ?$.when
[15:12:46] <kamoricks> shoky: Thanks.
[15:12:47] <bot-t> shoky, jQuery.when() - Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[15:15:03] <laidback_01> coldhead, MistuhKurtz thanks for the information - had to go for a bit, will try using those methods!
[15:15:40] <MistuhKurtz> just doing my job, sir.
[15:20:41] <torbjorn> im inserting an iframe from html string that includes the url, and it loads fine, however the url is redirected. how can i retrieve the redirected url? $("iframe").attr("src") remains the first address that i gave it
[15:25:10] <torbjorn> gah I found it but I get permission denied, in firebug at least
[15:25:16] <torbjorn> though in dom inspector i can see it. weird
[15:25:30] <torbjorn> ah no js would naturally be more limited
[15:25:42] <tw2113> cross domain issue perhaps?
[15:25:44] <tw2113> dunno
[15:25:48] <torbjorn> yeah
[15:27:25] <raj> how do I select an element with a class and a particular .data() property
[15:27:36] <raj> do I have to do .each()?
[15:30:13] <torbjorn> is there another way i can find out what url a given url might redirect to?
[15:32:35] <torbjorn> I tried to create an img and set src, but i cannot seem to find the new url anywhere in the imgs properties
[15:34:04] <tw2113> probably because the redirected-to url isn't available until the redirecting url has had its http request
[15:34:22] <torbjorn> I inserted the img in the document
[15:36:00] <tw2113> and i'm saying i doubt the ending url is ever part of the initial data you have
[15:36:57] <skypce> hello people

[15:37:30] <skypce> the href attribute of links doesnt appear in links
[15:37:57] <w00tner> hello
[15:38:04] <w00tner> can you tell whats wrong with this function? http://pastie.org/5586321

[15:38:49] <tw2113> >=
[15:39:39] <tw2113> w00tner, your comparison operator is reversed
[15:45:50] <sheilablackrose> is this the right way of doing it http://jsfiddle.net/GRrnE/
[15:50:32] <zg> i'm assuming this isn't valid: $('.input').html($('.history .command')[hist_comm--]);
[15:51:34] <nerk> zg you can use .eq(index)
[15:51:48] <zg> oh nice
[15:51:57] <nerk> so eq(hist_comm--)
[16:02:02] <sheilablackrose> anyone comments?
[16:02:03] <sheilablackrose> is this the right way of doing it http://jsfiddle.net/GRrnE/
[16:02:37] <zg> why var $tagCheckBox
[16:02:40] <zg> just do tagCheckBox
[16:02:58] <sheilablackrose> ic
[16:03:04] <zg> tagCheckbox.removeAttr('checked');
[16:03:30] <zg> wait nvm, use .prop :P
[16:03:45] <sheilablackrose> i cant use proop
[16:03:45] <sheilablackrose> ?
[16:03:46] <sheilablackrose> oh ok
[16:03:48] <sheilablackrose> :)
[16:04:02] <zg> i didn't realize they depracated .attr
[16:04:20] <zg> are you trying to get rid of checked with .prop('checked',false) ?
[16:04:29] <sheilablackrose> but is that the best way to do it? previously when i was using an id i didnt need the checkbox.each i could just specify th eid stright. now i moved the id to th evalue field
[16:04:30] <zg> you should do .prop('checked',null)
[16:04:34] <zg> that'll get rid of the checked attribute
[16:04:41] <sheilablackrose> null
[16:04:46] <sheilablackrose> ok
[16:04:51] <sheilablackrose> false seems to work to
[16:05:00] <sheilablackrose> just curious on is the second loop really needed
[16:05:06] <sheilablackrose> or is there a better way of doing this
[16:05:18] <sheilablackrose> basically i want to update the checkbox with the value field
[16:06:47] <guideX> i'm using jquery 1.5.. I wish to hide all alert boxes..
[16:07:14] <guideX> I have tried window.alert = function() {} and alert = function() {}; but neither work
[16:07:56] <coldhead> works for me http://jsfiddle.net/PQvzK/
[16:07:58] <guideX> I am using jquery v1.5 because that's what works with jquery. I can also use 1.8.3 in no conflict mode
[16:08:14] <Tomashe> why do i get that: HierarchyRequestError: Node cannot be inserted at the specified point in the hierarchy file:///E:/Webapp/public_html/js/jquery-1.7.2.min.js Line 6407
[16:08:20] <Tomashe> on jquery.post
[16:09:03] <coldhead> Tomashe: can you show us the actual post() call which is triggering that?
[16:09:14] <Tomashe> nvm find the issue
[16:09:15] <Tomashe> :)
[16:09:26] <coldhead> thanks for wasting our time
[16:09:31] <coldhead> i kid i kid
[16:09:41] <zg> his head is cold, don't let him get to you
[16:09:41] <coldhead> good work Tomashe, best wishes for the rest of your life

[16:10:52] <sheilablackrose> colhead has been hyper lately
[16:10:56] <apple1004> Hi All..
[16:10:57] <sheilablackrose> :p
[16:11:06] <zg> maybe this works: http://jsfiddle.net/GRrnE/1/
[16:13:39] <sheilablackrose> ic
[16:13:42] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[16:15:21] <zg> sheilablackrose: did that help? I basically just rewrote it, fixed a few things
[16:15:49] <zg> $('input').prop('checked','checked') means <input checked="checked">
[16:16:02] <zg> $('input').prop('checked',null) means <input> (removes the checked attribute)
[16:16:14] <sheilablackrose> zg yup i will change the naming syntax
[16:16:26] <sheilablackrose> although i was hoping to get rid of the checkbox.each
[16:16:28] <sheilablackrose> a loop in  a loop
[16:16:29] <sheilablackrose> :p
[16:16:32] <zg> checked is a strange attribute because it can be left without a value, so something can be checked if it's written like so: <input checked>
[16:16:51] <sheilablackrose> so use null
[16:16:52] <sheilablackrose> ?
[16:17:04] <zg> yea
[16:17:09] <zg> i donno if false actually removes the attribute
[16:17:40] <bradmaxs> For some reason $('#aFormnNat).submit(); isn't submitting that form but the first one on the page.  Am I missing something with the .submit() finction?
[16:17:48] <bradmaxs> function
[16:18:12] <sheilablackrose> well the true n false works
[16:18:17] <sheilablackrose> but if its better to use null
[16:18:20] <sheilablackrose> ill use null :)
[16:18:45] <zg> sheilablackrose: it's what the api says :P

[16:22:40] <coldhead> tw2113: have you heard their recent live release from like 1985?
[16:22:49] <tw2113> no
[16:22:53] <coldhead> its pretty great
[16:22:58] <tw2113> last album i have by them is The Eternal?
[16:23:16] <coldhead> all the stuff you'd assume is studio tricks is actual live alchemical genius
[16:23:22] <coldhead> yes that's still the most recent studio
[16:23:33] <coldhead> (excepting some soundtrack stuff)
[16:24:08] <coldhead> i've been listening to this live chicago thing every day for the last couple of months
[16:24:30] <tw2113> not sure they'll have any new studio anyway given the hiatus
[16:24:40] <coldhead> no it's the end of the line
[16:24:47] <coldhead> still they had a good run
[16:24:58] <tw2113> some 30 years?
[16:25:03] <coldhead> they have a lot of unreleased stuff to issue
[16:25:07] <coldhead> almost 30 yeah
[16:25:13] <tw2113> it's no Rolling Stones?but they're dinosaurs anyway
[16:26:04] <coldhead> i think they'd prefer to have made good music than to have made adequate music for a long time
[16:26:26] <tw2113> i could see that
[16:28:54] <cattlefraud> hello
[16:30:36] <sheilablackrose> i have a checkbox <input type="checkbox" id="mycb1" data-subIds="1" /> to get the data i need to do this right var ids = $('#mycb1').data('subIds');
[16:31:00] <cattlefraud> I need help with datepicker http://jsfiddle.net/re8Bf/
[16:31:46] <coldhead> yes sheilablackrose
[16:31:50] <cattlefraud> sheilablackrose: you could do var ids = $("mycbl").attr("data-subIds");
[16:32:10] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[16:32:12] <coldhead> sheilablackrose: i have a feeling like attributes are forced to lower case
[16:32:29] <coldhead> so it might be simpler to make them all lowercase from the outset
[16:32:42] <coldhead> sub-ids instead of subIds
[16:33:03] <sheilablackrose> ic
[16:33:14] <sheilablackrose> is that why im getting undefined
[16:33:30] <coldhead> could be!
[16:33:42] <sheilablackrose> noooooooooooooooooooo
[16:33:46] <sheilablackrose> now there is more to do
[16:33:58] <sheilablackrose> i just finish changing everything to data field from id
[16:34:01] <sheilablackrose> ahh :(
[16:34:37] <coldhead> valuable learning experiences
[16:34:45] <tw2113> i don't mean this to be rude in any way, but i'm hoping sheilablackrose is learning and absorbing a lot of knowledge
[16:35:04] <tw2113> she's been in here regularly for a couple weeks now
[16:35:20] <coldhead> sheilablackrose is a she?!
[16:35:47] <tw2113> so is rmurphey, but i don't think you believe that either
[16:35:53] <cattlefraud> lol
[16:36:40] <coldhead> mr murphey is definitely a guy, you might be thinking of someone else
[16:39:23] <sheilablackrose> wen i first came in here i couldt do th eslightest bit of jquery. now i can get things to work although might not be the most ifficient way.
[16:40:08] <sheilablackrose> a little confuse as they r many syntax to accomplish the same thing
[16:41:36] <cattlefraud> sheilablackrose: check out "jQuery in Action" it's how I learned the basics
[16:42:39] <coldhead> i also endorse this text
[16:42:39] <sheilablackrose> is that a book?
[16:42:50] <coldhead> yes, from manning publications
[16:43:21] <sheilablackrose> im actually looking at tutorial in plural sight
[16:43:24] <sheilablackrose> ny comments on that?
[16:44:39] <coldhead> yes, your grammar is appalling
[16:47:48] <sheilablackrose> i think more like spelling?
[16:48:29] <coldhead> ^ this is what i'm talking about
[16:49:44] <sheilablackrose> what is wrong with that grammar?

[16:58:37] <bradmaxs> $('#WineryNearbyForm').submit(); is not submitting that form but another one on the page? Do I have to declare it differently?
[17:00:55] <coldhead> cattlefraud: you are returning [false, '', ''] if the date is unavailable
[17:01:05] <coldhead> and otherwise you don't return anything
[17:01:10] <coldhead> which is like returning undefined

[17:04:52] <bradmaxs> coldhead: I must be messing something up wit the submissions and routes on the php side.
[17:06:46] <coldhead> the code you have there should only submit the form with that ID
[17:07:01] <coldhead> and the only reason i could think that would fail is if  your HTML is wrong
[17:07:14] <coldhead> or you have some other code that is messing with the natural order

[17:10:28] <bradmaxs> Ha! It is the routing of my framework and having 2 forms for the same model on the same page. Thanks for your help however because I wasn't sure.
[17:11:01] <bradmaxs> I try to leave out any code that would mess with my woman's love:) Although sometimes coding too long does just that!

[17:30:59] <thirdender> I'm having an issue setting -moz-transform using .css(...) in jQuery 1.8.3... read somewhere that jQuery 1.8 tries to automatically add the correct vendor prefixes, and it looks like Firefox 17.0.1 looks specifically for just `transform`. Anyone else having this problem, or is there something else fishy in my code?
[17:32:21] <coldhead> sheilablackrose: http://jsfiddle.net/GRrnE/3/
[17:33:35] <sheilablackrose> ic
[17:33:40] <sheilablackrose> so u make it think its an array
[17:33:48] <sheilablackrose> another method is not using the .data
[17:33:53] <sheilablackrose> its forcing it to be an integer
[17:34:05] <sheilablackrose> i changed it to .attr(data-subids)
[17:34:09] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[17:34:52] <thirdender> nm, looks like a problem with the 3-d transforms...
[17:35:59] <coldhead> why does everyone hate data() and recommend attr()
[17:36:04] <coldhead> the hell is wrong with you all
[17:36:43] <tw2113> they probably just can't seem to get it to work
[17:36:52] <sheilablackrose> its converting my values
[17:37:11] <sheilablackrose> which is a better programing syntax?
[17:37:14] <sheilablackrose> .data or .attr
[17:37:39] <coldhead> i like data because that's what it's there for
[17:37:39] <thirdender> .attr will cast to string, .data should preserve your Javascript variable type
[17:38:25] <thirdender> .attr is used for setting attributes on the HTML tag
[17:38:26] <b-ot> thirdender, memorised “attr”.
[17:38:45] <sheilablackrose> ic
[17:38:50] <tw2113> "Every attempt is made to convert the string to a JavaScript value (this includes booleans, numbers, objects, arrays, and null) otherwise it is left as a string. To retrieve the value's attribute as a string without any attempt to convert it, use the attr() method. "
[17:39:04] <tw2113> from http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:39:10] <sheilablackrose> hehe thats what i read
[17:39:33] <tw2113> i figured all data-* were strings anyway
[17:39:36] <tw2113> shows what i know
[17:40:36] <thirdender> hmm... that should only cast if pulled from the `data-...` attributes, right? setting a value with .data should preserve the type?
[17:41:34] <snover> yes. welcome to the joy of the dumbest api change since jquery 1.4
[17:42:38] <coldhead> it doesn't matter
[17:42:43] <coldhead> js has dynamic types
[17:42:57] <coldhead> which i think means you never have to know what type something has
[17:43:05] <coldhead> it's all so dynamic
[17:44:26] <snover> coldhead: you can improve the dynamics of your code by installing wooden keys in your keyboard. it helps make the code feel more vibrant and alive.
[17:44:46] <snover> plastic keys are the worst, they take away the 8th bit of each character
[17:45:20] <thirdender> coldhead: no, you should always know what type a variable is... dynamic just means it can be cast automatically as needed, but you as the programmer need to understand that with that flexibility comes the responsibility to track your variable types and use them correctly
[17:46:22] <coldhead> i don't have time for that
[17:46:30] <coldhead> i'm just going to toString() everything all the time
[17:46:47] <coldhead> that way i can solve all my problems with regular expressions
[17:46:50] <thirdender> coldhead: lol, that was my next suggestion :-p or String(myVar), Number(myVar)
[17:47:00] <coldhead> gentlemen, i'm glad we had this talk
[17:47:01] <thirdender> String(myVar).replace(...)
[17:47:46] <thirdender> coldhead: or, just use /.../.test(myVar), because it casts automatically before testing (it evaluates .test as a method of the regex, and the method takes a string as a argument... free casting!)
[17:48:42] <coldhead> oh that's gonna save me a lot of time!
[17:48:51] * tw2113 unfollows the yayQuery podcast twitter account
[17:49:04] <coldhead> dark days, tw2113
[17:49:25] <tw2113> i'm sure if it ever actually returns, i'll hear about it
[17:50:44] <coldhead> or they'll see their follower count drop and abandon it dejectedly
[17:50:46] <coldhead> because of you
[17:50:51] <coldhead> because... of you
[17:52:32] <tw2113> they stopped caring long before i unfollowed
[17:52:54] <snover> tw2113: i still care
[17:53:04] <snover> but nobody wants to hear people drone on and on about dojo
[17:56:53] <tw2113> i say to that?bring it
[17:56:55] <tw2113> :D
[18:08:30] <Imaginativeone> is it possible for me to build my document in stages using jQuery?
[18:08:30] <bot-t> (236 hours ago) <coldhead> tell Imaginativeone IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE
[18:09:08] <Imaginativeone> what's with the bot-t?
[18:09:08] <bot-t> Imaginativeone, Very doubtful.
[18:09:40] <Imaginativeone> is anyone in?
[18:10:15] <Imaginativeone> how do I turn off the bot?
[18:10:52] <tw2113> paging coldhead
[18:11:11] <snover> b-ot: can you turn off bot-t?
[18:11:11] <b-ot> snover, it is decidedly so.
[18:11:49] <snover> b-ot: are you sure?
[18:11:49] <b-ot> snover, don’t count on it.
[18:12:01] <snover> well alright then.
[18:13:19] <Imaginativeone> bot-t: off
[18:13:20] <bot-t> Imaginativeone, .off() - Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[18:13:38] <Imaginativeone> bot-t: turnOffBot
[18:13:39] <bot-t> Imaginativeone, Couldn't find "turnOffBot" in jQuery Docs.
[18:14:13] <Imaginativeone> bot-t: shutdown bot
[18:14:15] <bot-t> Imaginativeone, Serkey.com - Stat My Web - http://www.statmyweb.com/site/serkey.com
[18:14:28] <tw2113> it'd be easier to just get back to your question at hand Imaginativeone
[18:15:09] <Imaginativeone> thanks tw2113
[18:15:11] <abjorn> imsky mah boi
[18:15:17] <Imaginativeone> are you able to help?
[18:15:18] <imsky> abjorn ma brotha
[18:15:23] <imsky> how's your holiday season
[18:15:30] <abjorn> sick, but other than that good
[18:15:34] <tw2113> i don't think a page render should be reliant on JS
[18:15:39] <imsky> you too huh
[18:15:47] <tw2113> it should load without needing js enabled
[18:15:50] <imsky> austin get snowed in?
[18:15:54] <abjorn> no
[18:15:55] <snover> Imaginativeone: your question doesn’t make any sense, so i don’t know that anyone will be able to help
[18:15:57] <abjorn> :o
[18:16:05] <imsky> over here in WARMLAND we got like 3 feet
[18:16:20] <tw2113> why do i think i should know abjorn on twitter
[18:16:32] <abjorn> uhhh
[18:16:33] <snover> why should you do anything in life, tw2113
[18:16:34] <imsky> maybe because you're a creepy stalker tw2113
[18:16:48] <Imaginativeone> snover: I have a text document that I'm trying to transform with jQuery
[18:16:51] <tw2113> we'll never know for sure
[18:17:01] <abjorn> well it's not my twitter handle so
[18:17:09] <snover> that sure sounds like the wrong tool for the job, but ok
[18:17:21] <imsky> @abjorn has a good ring to it
[18:17:28] <Imaginativeone> as step 01: this is some text >> <p>this is some text</p>
[18:17:46] <snover> i think what you are looking for is a markdown parser
[18:17:51] <snover> try https://github.com/chjj/marked
[18:17:51] <Imaginativeone> am I able to create that and then transform it further?
[18:18:10] <abjorn> imsky: Yeah, I wasn't thinking when I made my twitter handle
[18:18:20] <imsky> np brah
[18:18:27] <imsky> it's a good handle
[18:18:34] <imsky> i'm just reading about the secondary market for twitter usernames
[18:18:36] <abjorn> well someone already has @abjorn apparently
[18:18:39] <imsky> since @imsky is taken by chinese kevin
[18:18:46] <imsky> secondary market for twitter usernames is ILLEGAL
[18:18:48] <snover> ni hao imsky
[18:18:50] <imsky> not unlike DIAMONDS
[18:18:51] <tw2113> coldhead, good news for you when you return
[18:18:57] <imsky> hao snover
[18:19:26] <imsky> wish i came up with snapchat
[18:19:28] <imsky> god dammit
[18:19:50] <imsky> new plan for 2013: think of something horny teenagers would love to do and build a business around it
[18:21:51] <abjorn> of course
[18:26:22] <imsky> #jquery seems unusually quiet all of a sudden
[18:30:00] <wroathe> fg
[18:30:03] <wroathe> whoops
[18:33:02] <coldhead> what's that about what, tw2113?
[18:33:50] <tw2113> i used .data() in a slider plugin that used youtube video ids in data-attributes
[18:34:07] <tw2113> a couple months back, by this point
[18:34:18] <tw2113> none of that attr() pishposh
[18:35:27] <imsky> wow
[18:35:29] <imsky> good job
[18:37:37] <tw2113> i know, right?
[18:40:13] <snover> hopefully you never try to do the same with tweet ids
[18:43:12] <tw2113> nah, i just needed an easy way to switch youtube videos on('click')
[19:40:43] <coldhead> i see it all i see it all i see it all i see it all i see it all i see it all i see it all i see it all i see it all i see it all i see it all i see it all
[19:43:15] <imsky> DO YOU COLDHEAD
[20:11:48] <veQue> hi guys
[20:12:32] <veQue> learning dvorak
[20:13:02] <veQue> that is all
[20:17:06] <coldhead> such a senseless waste
[20:18:50] <veQue> i dont think so
[20:19:19] <veQue> i'm slow but improving
[20:19:38] <coldhead> but what happens when you have to use someone else's qwerty keyboard?
[20:19:48] <coldhead> which most keyboards on the planet overwhelmingly are?
[20:20:01] <coldhead> i guess you switch to dvorak and type blind
[20:20:09] <coldhead> i withdraw my criticism
[20:20:12] <coldhead> let's go get drunk
[20:27:22] <veQue> coldhead: i am typing blind now
[20:27:57] <veQue> settings switched

[20:40:58] <MacWinner> i'm a bit of javascript noob… is there a good pointer out there for how to put a fileuploader into a modal form that is loaded via ajax? (i'm using jq 1.8.1 and fineuploader 3.0 and bootstrap 2.2.2)..  using bootstrap modals.. i guess i'm just unclear on how to call the javascript createUploader() method on the ajax modal that is loaded..
[20:43:53] <MacWinner> i read something about using a 1 pixel image, and detecting when it's loaded, then calling the createUploader method.. is this a good practice?
[20:53:25] <coldhead> that doesn't seem like a good solution MacWinner
[20:53:50] <coldhead> very convoluted
[20:54:58] <coldhead> could you not bind to the show event described here http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals ?
[21:01:10] <MacWinner> coldhead, let me check.. thanks!
[21:02:45] <MacWinner> coldhead, that event is when the modal is shown.. but the modal body is retreived via ajax…  i wonder if there is some event to bind to when the modal body is complete
[21:03:37] <MacWinner> the docs say the modal body will be injected via jQuery's "load" method..
[21:05:00] <vladikoff> MacWinner, http://api.jquery.com/load/ read about the Callback Function
[21:16:22] <dismist> you're using twitter bootstrap for the modals?
[21:16:43] <dismist> there is API available on the twitter documentation site.... there's a callback for the modal shown method
[21:17:17] <dismist> so you would create an event listener with their api method for detecting when the modal is shown
[21:17:26] <dismist> and call your fileuploader thing there
[21:17:55] <coldhead> great job everyone
[21:18:31] <dismist> whoops i missed your comment earlier coldhead
[21:18:32] <dismist> lol
[21:18:35] <dismist> said the same thing i did
[21:19:06] <coldhead> you said it better
[22:42:01] <sheilablackrose>  $(this).attr('data-flagids'); doesnt seem to work. any idea? $(this).data('flagids') works.
[22:44:25] <coldhead> why don't you just use the one that works
[22:44:31] <coldhead> it's less typing
[22:44:39] <sheilablackrose> i want to know why
[22:58:57] <Xabster> I use jquery to put some text into a <textarea>. I can do it as many times as I want, unless I manually edit the content of the field in my browser then it ignores the updates
[22:59:05] <Xabster> I have no clue what to look for to debug this
[23:06:35] <Xabster> This is my test-site: http://188.114.146.35/   -- the problem is that i can click submit and get text to show in the textarea, and I can change the server that sends the text so that new text is shown when i click submit, but if i manually delete a few lines in the field, then i can't update it no more
[23:15:09] <sciophyte> hey guys.  I know it's not jquery, but anyone familiar with jstree?
