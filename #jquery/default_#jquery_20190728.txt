[18:57:24] <shoukran> I have a script that gets a start/end time and makes a dropdown list of the range. It works when the times are like 8am-8pm, however depending on the user's timezone it can be displayed as 9pm-5am. How do I change the script so that it works if the start time is greater than the end time? https://dpaste.de/g9O9
[23:03:23] <xyz111> Hi, I have a jquery element which has 2 event handlers assigned to the 'click' event (assigned using $e.on('click', myHandler) ) . I want to remove just one of those handlers. How can I do this? Thanks :)
