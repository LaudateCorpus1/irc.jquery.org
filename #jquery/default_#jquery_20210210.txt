[11:42:05] <mark36ph> hi. is it possible to shorten this? i am using it for a faq page, and wanted to hide all answers until they are wanted. i can hide all with the hide part i have, but what im struggling with is would i have to show them all in the way i am doing or can i use a less code method?
[11:42:06] <mark36ph> https://jsfiddle.net/scepLtb5/1/
[13:08:15] <CuirPig> I am trying to create the world's simplest svg to append to the top and bottom of my viewport. I have done it a million different ways and it still is not working.
[13:08:26] <robertmaxrees> wrong channel?
[13:08:27] <CuirPig> The strange part is that in the console, I can see the svg elements
[13:08:45] <CuirPig> I'm using jquery to append the elements and create them
[13:08:57] <robertmaxrees> so is the issue with appending the svgs?  or with the svgs themselves?
[13:09:13] <CuirPig> And if I copy the outhtml from the svg elements and paste it in the html panel it renders fine.
[13:09:20] <CuirPig> https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/RwoGYZm?editors=1011
[13:09:51] <CuirPig> Not sure. I appears that jquery creates the elements, updates them, appends them no problems. but they aren't  visible.
[13:09:55] <robertmaxrees> so for starters: jquery and svg don't really mix
[13:10:11] <CuirPig> It's an element.
[13:10:19] <robertmaxrees> but not DOM :)
[13:10:20] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/6794343/923919
[13:10:28] <robertmaxrees> so there are some special considerations you need ot make.
[13:10:30] <CuirPig> How can it show up in the html and not render
[13:11:59] <CuirPig> if I use the exact html that jquery generates and appends to the body element. and I paste it into the html tab of codepen, it works.
[13:12:22] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't necessarily "speak" svg.  read the SO answer I linked and start there.
[13:14:35] <CuirPig> that's if I want to use jquery IN an svg document. NOt the same thing
[13:15:06] <CuirPig> I want to append an SVG element to the DOM as an inline SVG <svg><path d=''></path></svg>
[13:15:20] <CuirPig> Yesterday, no problem. Today, not working. Not sure why
[13:15:30] <robertmaxrees> well, what did you change? :)
[13:15:44] <CuirPig> Everything. But the generated HTML is identical
[13:18:41] <robertmaxrees> so all of the appends here are properly inserting the elements, you're just not sure why they aren't displaying, yeah?
[13:18:59] <CuirPig> yes. Here's an example that works: https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/XWNjoEZ
[13:19:17] <robertmaxrees> well, your bg_btm has an issue - there's a NaN in there.
[13:19:29] <CuirPig> Super simple, but I need to use variables for window.innerWidth and window.InnerHeight
[13:22:05] <robertmaxrees> i assume you already read https://stackoverflow.com/a/3642265/923919 ?
[13:22:59] <CuirPig> is that the one you just posted?
[13:23:06] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:23:12] <robertmaxrees> it's another one that provides some more details.
[13:23:46] <robertmaxrees> that should help clarify the issue of using jquery with SVG like this.  also provides a solution.
[13:24:01] <robertmaxrees> (i also wouldn't re-link something you've already read ;) )
[13:27:14] <CuirPig> So it sounds to me like I can generate the svg element but can't access its siblings. because jquery uses innerHtml() to get the siblings.
[13:27:24] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[13:27:44] <CuirPig> so I assume that $(svg).html(somehtml) isn't going to work either
[13:27:49] <robertmaxrees> hence why i said "jquery doesn't speak svg"
[13:27:57] <CuirPig> jquery needs to work that out.
[13:28:01] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:28:05] <robertmaxrees> SVG isn't DOM
[13:28:08] <CuirPig> because svg rocks
[13:28:27] <CuirPig> how is it not dom with it's an inline element?
[13:28:28] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a DOM abstraction library.  there are plugins available to add support for SVG if you need that :)
[13:29:06] <robertmaxrees> SVG has a separate DOM structure.  the SVG element basically creates a new "context" for it.
[13:29:56] <CuirPig> I look forward to the day when you can create any element you want <booger> </booger> for example and jquery can handle it
[13:30:41] <robertmaxrees> you need webcomponents for that.
[13:31:10] <CuirPig> what if you modified the text of an svg element?
[13:31:23] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno.  i would avoid using jquery for anything SVG.
[13:34:54] <CuirPig> Thank youfor your help and patience. Sorry if I sound grumpy. I opened my mouth and said that it would be super easy using svg to make this design for someone. Now, i'm screwed.
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> :) it's all good.  we've all been in that position.
[13:39:29] <CuirPig> aha! I figured out a quick solution. Since I can generate the svg code and append it with jquery, I just remove the top and bottom svgs on resize. LOL Now it works. I just can't access its children.
[13:42:19] <robertmaxrees> fyi: when doing stuff on resize and scroll make sure you're throttling your logic.
[13:44:23] <CuirPig> For sure. I was just trying to get thing to render so I didn't mind. But I'll use onanimationFrame (sp?) and a delay to throttle it.
[13:44:38] <robertmaxrees> i would do an explicit throttle instead.
[13:44:43] <robertmaxrees> but whatever works :)
[13:44:45] <CuirPig> why is that?
[13:45:00] <CuirPig> I trust your judgement, just curious
[13:46:03] <robertmaxrees> the JS itself is doing juuust enough that I'd be concerned - creating new jquery objects isn't usually a concern.  creating new jquery objects many times a second can be :)
[13:47:11] <CuirPig> So I was more used to debounce than throttle. I'll check out throttle now. thanks.
[14:03:41] <robertmaxrees> hey mark36ph saw your question from earlier - there are a lot of ways to reduce the amount of JS for a case like that.  just depends on some specifics.
