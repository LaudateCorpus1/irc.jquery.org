[02:43:08] <littlebit1> hi people, i wanted to know how to use an xmlhttprequest with an id parameter in my url
[02:45:55] <Woet> littlebit1: the same way.
[02:46:31] <Cork> littlebit1: just put the id in the url
[02:46:55] <Cork> as long as it isn't a get call and you want it as a parameter, jquery or xhr won't provide any helpers for it
[02:47:36] <Cork> $.get('/test/url', { id: 1 }) would call /test/url?id=1
[02:47:45] <Cork> but except for that, just build your url
[02:48:14] <littlebit1> it is a post request
[02:48:30] <Cork> ya, then you would just have to build the url before using it
[02:48:53] <Cork> there are plugins to jquery for restfull urls if that is what you're looking at
[06:06:34] <plzHelpM3> I'm trying to add an event listener to a dynamically added element, but with little success. The element is added once the 'i' tag is clicked,  but for some reason the new element isn't recognised by the event listener.  Anyone have any suggestion? https://codepen.io/plzHelpM33/pen/NZgbeW
[06:24:58] <plzHelpM3> don't know if this could be simpler, but i figured out a workaround: $(document).on('keypress', function (e) {    var active = document.activeElement.id;    if(e.which == '13' && active == 'commentBox'){        console.log('enter pressed');    }});
[06:55:09] <Cork> plzHelpM3: why don't you juse use .on(event, selector, func)?
[06:58:12] <Cork> so $(document).on('keydown
[06:58:14] <Cork> opps
[06:58:46] <Cork> so $(document).on('keydown', '#comboBox', function(event) { if(event.which == 13) {  console.log('enter pressed'); }})
[07:00:20] <plzHelpM3> looks simpler! thanks Cork
[07:01:26] <Cork> opps i read comboBox instead of commentBox... so you will have to fix the id
[07:01:40] <plzHelpM3> yeah i fixed it
[07:04:38] <plzHelpM3> your approach definitely reduces the amount of event listeners lol
[07:04:42] <plzHelpM3> thanks again
[07:05:40] <Cork> np :)
[08:31:18] <littlebit1> hi people, is there a way to detect a tabclose event?
[08:33:09] <littlebit1> I'm developing a site where I want to sign out users if they close a tab that had my site open.
[08:33:42] <pavonia> There's the unload event which will detect all kind of navigation away from the current page
[08:34:14] <littlebit1> pavonia: ok, but how can I distinguish my usecase from all the others
[08:35:00] <pavonia> I don't think you can
[08:35:53] <pavonia> Why don't you want your users to log out when they open another site?
[08:37:29] <littlebit1> pavonia: I have a corporate site in which they are authenticated. that site has resources when they enter that resource it is being reserved only for that one user to use / edit it.
[08:38:19] <littlebit1> pavonia: one of the many scenarios is that the user could have closed the tab or even the browser (shutdown of the os included) even.
[08:38:42] <littlebit1> pavonia: i need to cover these issues
[08:40:14] <pavonia> Yes, but I don't understand why you want to distinguish tab closes from navigation to another website. Both actions should be equivalent in your use case and both would be covered by the unload event
[08:41:31] <littlebit1> pavonia: well if the user presses f5 a logout is note needed
[08:44:00] <littlebit1> pavonia: then the next scenario i want to log the user out if there is no activity
[08:44:12] <littlebit1> with this: https://github.com/serkanyersen/ifvisible.js
[08:46:13] <pavonia> That second scenario should be handled by the server
[08:47:19] <Cork> littlebit1: don't forget that ppl can open more then one tab of the current page
[08:47:29] <Cork> so just "you closed a tab" isn't enough information
[08:47:50] <littlebit1> pavonia: y should that be handled by the server? and how
[08:48:29] <littlebit1> Cork: that is true. thought about that but don't know how to solve that solution
[08:48:35] <Cork> littlebit1: the only fairly secure way to do it is to have a websocket connection to the server, and when all of them are closed for the current session you can close the session
[08:48:38] <littlebit1> *problem
[08:48:55] <Cork> but that means you will have rappidly more connections on the server (and can't be php)
[08:49:15] <littlebit1> Cork: is there a library for that?
[08:49:35] <Cork> websocket is an object offered by the browser
[08:49:48] <Cork> and server side there are plenty for websocket connections
[08:50:00] <Cork> all you need to handle is ping and session close events
[08:50:08] <Cork> (server side)
[08:50:19] <littlebit1> Cork: ok, that could cover the logout scenario
[08:50:20] <Cork> client side would be connect and reconnect
[08:50:51] <Cork> littlebit1: but ya, how most do it is by simply having a timeout on the session
[08:50:53] <littlebit1> Cork: but what about a session timeout. Lets say the user closes his / her laptop and goes off to a trip and then opens the laptop
[08:50:57] <Cork> and if no activity happens just close it
[08:51:13] <Cork> littlebit1: that would close the websocket
[08:51:19] <Cork> as it is a socket
[08:51:22] <littlebit1> Cork: :/
[08:51:53] <littlebit1> Cork: I'll look into it
[08:52:01] <littlebit1> thx for the tipp guys
[08:52:14] <Cork> littlebit1: unless you have very sensitive data, i would recommend just having a server session timeout
[08:52:40] <Cork> where you refuse to use a session if the "last active" value is graiter then say 5 min
[08:53:04] <Cork> or 15min for that matter
[08:53:31] <Cork> cause socket will close the session if you get a network hickup or what ever
[08:53:46] <littlebit1> Cork: do you have a recommendation for that?
[08:53:47] <Cork> and that has a tendency to drive users nuts
[08:54:00] <Cork> littlebit1: it is completely server side dependent
[08:54:08] <Cork> and is fairly easy to do
[08:54:33] <Cork> just before you do anything sensitive in the server code check the last access timestamp from the session store
[08:54:45] <Cork> and if it is in range update it, else close the session and redirect to the login page
[08:54:58] <littlebit1> Cork: I'm developing the solution on asp.net, now I know sockets. that is not the problem but I have no experience with windows server products
[08:55:17] <littlebit1> Cork: thought of using cookies
[08:55:19] <Cork> littlebit1: that is way WAY out of scope of this channel
[08:55:41] <littlebit1> Cork: :D true
[10:01:01] <kalel> hi
[10:01:04] <kalel> hi why button element can't contain block ? I'm looking at html dtd and it says : <!ELEMENT BUTTON - - (%flow;)* -(A|%formctrl;|FORM|FIELDSET) -- push button -->
[10:01:24] <kalel> <!ENTITY % flow "%block; | %inline;">
[10:10:47] <thykka> kalel, that sounds like HTML4.01.. HTML5 has content categories that replace the old inline/block-level definition; https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#content-models
[10:16:10] <kalel> thykka  so in  HTML4.01 dtd it was valid ?
[10:16:35] <thykka> you still shouldn't put anything but phrasing content inside a button
[10:18:42] <kalel> thykka yes but in HTML 4.0.1 dtd it was valid to put div inside button right based on <!ELEMENT BUTTON - - (%flow;)* -(A|%formctrl;|FORM|FIELDSET) -- push button -->   ??
[10:19:26] <kalel> ooh sorry it was yes you mean
[10:21:28] <thykka> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ it's not even possible to design a DTD that would adhere to HTML5, not sure why you're looking at DTDs in the first place
[10:40:01] <essence> hey everyone, does anyone know if there's any browser compatibility issues by using .prop or .attr? or if I can rely on one of them for a better compatibility?
[10:47:27] <tichun> Can I change CSS for substrings with JQuery? I don't own the website, it would be a script in tampermonkey
[10:47:44] <tichun> Like change every occurence of "red" turn red
[10:55:46] <thykka> can do with tampermonkey, but not with CSS alone
[10:59:22] <z1haze> is there a method or approach to getting the first child of a jquery often? do you have to do like children().first()?
[11:11:31] <thykka> you could use the :first-child CSS pseudo-class?
[11:11:58] <thykka> i.e. instead of $('.foo').first(); --> $('.foo:first-child')
[12:16:21] <kalel> thykka switching className should  be done with .classList.remove('MyClass'); .classList.add('MyClass');
[12:16:29] <kalel> ?
[12:16:44] <kalel> I'm trying to figure out why this code doesn't work : function switch(oldClass, newClass) {    	list=Document.getElementsByClassName(oldClass);        for(i=0; i < list.length; ++i) {        	list[i].className=newClass;        }	    }
[12:16:52] <robertmaxrees> are you using jquery or no?
[12:17:47] <kalel> robertmaxr no I want to understand why this code doesn't work
[12:18:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up ##javascript for that then :)
[12:18:16] <thykka> i wouldn't write over className..
[12:18:32] <thykka> append or remove from it, sure, but don't re-write it entirely
[12:19:02] <kalel> Thanks
[12:19:39] <thykka> kalel, is your function's name "switch"=
[12:19:41] <thykka> ?
[12:19:45] <thykka> I think that's a reserved word..
[12:20:14] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[12:20:22] <kalel> thykaa don't know but this wasn't my question but thanks
[12:20:37] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords
[12:20:46] <thykka> kalel, also, 'document' should not be capitalized
[12:20:48] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript would have more info on the subject though.
[12:20:56] <thykka> kalel, https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/658gxmwh/1/
[12:23:25] <kalel> actually the code works but it's a bad practice
[12:23:34] <kalel> to do it like .className
