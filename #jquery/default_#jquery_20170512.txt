[00:30:51] <DexDeadly>  I have a question.  So I'm working on a modal that I need to edit a record.  I have the modal open and it prepopulates the value to what is in the database.  I have a jquery function that based off the one field will calculate and then place that result into a different field.  However when I edit the input field, the value is still staying as the original value and not what I changed the
[00:30:51] <DexDeadly> input box to.
[00:32:27] <DexDeadly> I used the same form and same function when I add, its just updated so that I can display the values and change what is needed
[00:48:23] <pavonia> DexDeadly: Please paste a sample of how you update the data structures
[01:36:24] <impliednude> I have a weird question that's going to show how stupid I am.
[01:36:44] <impliednude> I need to add a cookie when a user clicks a specific picture
[01:54:35] <pavonia> impliednude: js-cookie is an option
[01:59:22] <Cork> impliednude: are you sure it needs to be a cookie?
[01:59:34] <Cork> impliednude: meaning are you sure it needs to be visible to the server?
[01:59:48] <Cork> if not i would prob just go with localStorage
[01:59:57] <Cork> cleaner api
[03:03:16] <jungle-boy> hi
[03:03:50] <jungle-boy> is there any way to compress the css or minify using jquery lib ?
[03:06:07] <jungle-boy> https://github.com/css/csso got this one..
[03:08:40] <pavonia> Do you want this for dynamically created CSS?
[03:10:42] <jungle-boy> i am shwoing the css code on my application. so just want to make beautify and minify.. i do not want any compressor or gulp
[03:11:24] <jungle-boy> pavonia, yes may be .. i am creating css dynamically and showing in my webpage as tool
[03:14:34] <pavonia> Hhm, no idea then
[03:15:30] <jungle-boy> pavonia, what is your idea ,please share
[03:17:07] <pavonia> No idea, actually, just wanted to make sure you aren't talking about the server side
[03:18:30] <pavonia> Or maybe if you have a server-side solution you could format it via AJAX requests
[03:18:45] <jungle-boy> pavonia, i am looking solution on client side
[04:33:55] <Cork> jungle-boy: you could try https://github.com/google/code-prettify
[05:07:08] <mechanist> hello everyone
[05:07:18] <mechanist> I have a two file send form with two upload progress bars. While the first one works ok the second one doesn't: https://pastebin.com/x9c43FDQ
[05:07:27] <mechanist> somenoe has a clue?
[05:14:35] <Cork> mechanist: could you make a jsfiddle please
[06:00:11] <hirst> hey all currently sliding a child element to the edge of the parent element, which is currently jumping to the final width of the child, how can i make this slide out instead of jumping?
[06:01:21] <hirst> the wrapper is a fixed element
[06:02:18] <serengeor> hello
[06:02:36] <hirst> hi
[06:02:53] <serengeor> I think I've stumbled up on some jquery-ui datepicker bug introduced in new versions
[06:17:47] <Cork> hirst: sliding how?
[06:17:52] <Cork> css3 animation?
[06:18:16] <Cork> (if you could make a jsfiddle of the problem it would prob make it easier to answer)
[06:18:22] <Cork> aaan wfk => lunch
[06:19:23] <hirst> will work on it bare with
[06:32:22] <hirst> @Cork https://jsfiddle.net/g7feg592/#
[06:51:36] <hirst> @Cork? :3
[06:54:54] <Pradeep> Getting two errors, Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a call to pause().
[06:55:06] <Cork> hirst: hmm toggle slide is jquery ui right?
[06:55:08] <Pradeep> net::ERR_SPDY_PROTOCOL_ERROR
[06:55:17] <Pradeep> in chrome only
[06:55:25] <hirst> Yea
[06:55:47] <hirst> But you see what im trying to do? wanting to push that width out
[06:56:21] <hirst> to follow the text transition
[06:56:44] <Cork> hmm i can't find any direction option in http://api.jqueryui.com/toggle/
[06:56:59] <Cork> hirst: what i prob would do is just use css3
[06:57:24] <Cork> it would require to have a static width though
[06:57:58] <hirst> trying to be backward compatible
[06:58:10] <hirst> >.>
[06:58:23] <Cork> ya, i barely ever used uis animations
[06:58:41] <Cork> and THAT was like 3 years ago so i don't remember enough to be of much help
[06:58:56] <hirst> np ill continue googling
[06:59:01] <Cork> i suspect the problem is ui can't figure out the different dimentions
[06:59:07] <Cork> and that is why you get the jump
[06:59:27] <Cork> i remember the uis animation being very fragile
[06:59:29] <hirst> unless toggle show me the width
[06:59:38] <hirst> shows me the current width*
[07:01:29] <Cork> iiinteresting...
[07:01:36] <Cork> hirst: https://jsfiddle.net/g7feg592/4/
[07:01:43] <Cork> removing the directions "fixed" it
[07:02:25] <hirst> not really
[07:02:50] <Cork> uh, not?
[07:02:55] <Cork> works fine here
[07:02:58] <hirst> purple border is still jumping and now text is coming in from the left
[07:03:47] <Cork> you want the area to expand to the right and when that animation is done animate the text in from the left?
[07:03:52] <Cork> opps
[07:03:56] <Cork> that became weird
[07:04:22] <Cork> what i meant is you want the area to exapand to the left and when that animation is done slide in the text from the left or what?
[07:05:14] <hirst> i want it to slide with the text
[07:05:41] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/g7feg592/7/ ?
[07:05:46] <hirst> whilst the text is being revealed from the right - like pulling out a drawer
[07:06:34] <Cork> ah
[07:06:48] <Cork> that is cause you animate description and not something containing them
[07:07:28] <Cork> the description elements expand from top left to right bottom and "pushes" the parent wider
[07:07:48] <Cork> and that will result in the text showing like that, not much can be done about that
[07:08:16] <hirst> think i got it
[07:08:24] <hirst> use animate instead of toggle
[07:08:31] <hirst> set width to 0px
[07:08:41] <hirst> and hide the overflow
[07:10:11] <hirst> https://jsfiddle.net/g7feg592/4/
[07:10:31] <hirst> wrong link
[07:10:31] <hirst> https://jsfiddle.net/g7feg592/8/
[07:14:59] <hirst> ty @Cork for the help :)

[10:12:54] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[10:14:08] <Toerkeium> I'm using ajaxStart to show a modal window after 1 second of execution. Is there any way that I can change the text of this windows, while it's executing? if takes more than 20 seconds, change the text of the already opened modal window?
[10:14:32] <Toerkeium> I tried changing the $(modal).text("bla"); but it only changes for next executing
[11:16:22] <quechon> im using file api to loop through file names to show the user now how can i delete values from input file
[11:23:33] <JrWebDev> how can i get a pop up with input boxes
[11:23:45] <JrWebDev> alert(); ??
[12:03:02] <Akuw> i am getting this   The object does not accept this property or method
[12:04:30] <duch_kazatel> Akuw is it in your code?
[12:06:11] <Akuw> no
[12:06:29] <robertmarees> where are you getting the error?
[12:06:43] <Akuw> jquery.min.js
[12:06:56] <robertmarees> what version of jquery? and in what version of IE?
[12:07:19] <robertmarees> also, did the error start happening after you added some code?
[12:07:34] <Akuw> no
[12:07:35] <JrWebDev> is it possible to pop out a div and darken the background just like you would with an alert popup
[12:07:52] <robertmarees> JrWebDev that's how modals work.
[12:08:03] <robertmarees> Akuw so what versions of jq and IE?
[12:08:07] <JrWebDev> modals thats a new concept to me
[12:08:12] <JrWebDev> thank you robertmarees
[12:08:29] <robertmarees> JrWebDev you just didn't know what they're alled :)
[12:08:29] <Akuw> 8.0.7600
[12:08:30] <robertmarees> *called
[12:08:40] <JrWebDev> lol
[12:08:50] <JrWebDev> yes now i must google
[12:09:12] <Akuw> is this ok <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>     <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
[12:09:27] <robertmarees> Akuw that' why.  jquery 3.x doesn't support IE8
[12:09:54] <Akuw> then what is the url i need to use?
[12:10:00] <Akuw> please
[12:10:30] <robertmarees> you'll want to use the last in the 1.x series.
[12:11:16] <Akuw> old one?
[12:11:53] <robertmarees> not that old.  but 3.x doesn't support IE8.  the 1.x series does.
[12:12:19] <robertmarees> 1.12.4 was the last release for that one.
[12:13:13] <Akuw> wait
[12:13:19] <Akuw> if i update browser?
[12:13:23] <quechon> robertmarees: how can i remove a file from file input if i have a list of 4 how can i delete one
[12:13:45] <robertmarees> Akuw that's another option.  why are you using IE8 still?
[12:14:01] <Akuw> where can i get last version to windows 7?
[12:14:10] <robertmarees> last version of IE??
[12:14:16] <robertmarees> windows update...
[12:14:40] <robertmarees> or, y'know, google ;)
[12:14:50] <robertmarees> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer-11-for-windows-7-details.aspx
[12:14:55] <Akuw> what is the last version?
[12:15:06] <robertmarees> of IE for windows 7?
[12:15:09] <robertmarees> 11
[12:16:17] <robertmarees> quechon http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19060378/how-to-remove-one-specific-selected-file-from-input-file-control
[12:18:01] <Akuw> ok
[12:18:04] <Akuw> i will update
[12:18:19] <robertmarees> Akuw or use FF or Chrome.
[12:18:35] <Akuw> client use IE
[12:18:42] <Akuw> no way to change that
[12:18:47] <robertmarees> wait woah.
[12:18:49] <robertmarees> back up.
[12:19:00] <robertmarees> can the client upgrade their version of IE?
[12:19:08] <robertmarees> sometimes IT policies aren't that easy.
[12:19:18] <Akuw> yes, no problem, the problem is related to me
[12:19:20] <Akuw> hehehehehe
[12:19:24] <robertmarees> ooookay
[12:19:26] <quechon> so filereader is needed for that
[12:19:34] <Akuw> i use firefox and chrome
[12:19:45] <Akuw> but for this particular project client use IE
[12:19:45] <robertmaxrees> Akuw i might just drop down the JQ version at that point.
[12:19:47] <robertmaxrees> easier that way.
[12:20:09] <Akuw> but client will have last version
[12:20:15] <Akuw> no problem
[12:20:22] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[12:21:23] <Akuw> well i have to upfate windows
[12:21:25] <Akuw> :S
[12:21:33] <robertmaxrees> soooo don't.
[12:21:39] <robertmaxrees> just use JQ 1.x
[12:22:06] <robertmaxrees> it's not a big deal really.
[12:22:23] <quechon> robertmaxrees  would it work if i create a hidden input and use that as a id to access that index in list
[12:22:47] <robertmaxrees> quechon i have no idea.  i'd have to play with it.
[12:38:11] * hlve slaps quechon with a trout.
[12:44:32] <tables> anyone know how to format like that?
[12:44:34] <tables> 5/12/2017, 4:05:00 PM
[12:44:34] <Toerkeium> guys, why this $("#buthtlrq").unbind("ajaxStart"); doesn't work and makes ajaxStart start?
[12:44:38] <tables> var d=new Date(t+\" UTC\").toLocaleString();    <-- this format is '5/12/2017, 4:05:00 PM'  i want just Fri May 12
[12:44:46] <Toerkeium> tried with .off also
[12:47:10] <pavonia> tables: Have you tried the suggested dateFormat plugin?
[12:48:07] <tables> no
[12:49:38] <Toerkeium> no one?
[12:52:08] <pavonia> Toerkeium: Do you have a sample fiddle? I think that is supposed to work
[12:52:15] <tables> nonohow do i do it with dateFormat?
[12:52:35] <tables> how do i do it with dateFormat?
[12:53:36] <Toerkeium> pavonia: I'll do it now
[12:57:30] <Toerkeium> pavonia: http://jsfiddle.net/SXkck/459/
[12:57:43] <Toerkeium> wronmg example
[12:57:44] <Toerkeium> wait
[13:00:55] <pavonia> tables: https://github.com/phstc/jquery-dateFormat has examples, you just need to replace the time format there with the one you want from the given list
[13:07:54] <Toerkeium> pavonia http://jsfiddle.net/SXkck/464/
[13:10:35] <pavonia> Toerkeium: There's no unbind in there?
[13:11:15] <Toerkeium> did the example with .off, but tried unbind also
[13:11:31] <Toerkeium> same results
[13:11:55] <Toerkeium> updated with unbind
[13:12:37] <pavonia> There's no .off either
[13:12:39] <robertmaxrees> gotta hit update and share the new link.
[13:13:08] <Toerkeium> this one pavonia? http://jsfiddle.net/SXkck/467/
[13:13:48] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium so you wnat to remove the handler for ajaxStart?
[13:14:12] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: only when I click on specific button
[13:14:46] <pavonia> You have to remove it from document, not ".clicked"
[13:14:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:15:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/SXkck/468/
[13:16:04] <Toerkeium> but then it won't work at all
[13:16:14] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:16:29] <robertmaxrees> so really you don't want to run ajaxStart for a particular click
[13:16:29] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:16:38] <Toerkeium> yes
[13:16:49] <robertmaxrees> What're you doing in the ajaxstart handler?
[13:16:53] <sigdk> I need help on this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/30c56c335b9dbbe91dc099bb4c23f0e3   any hint? why would users be undefined?
[13:17:23] <robertmaxrees> sigdk because data.data isn't what you think it is?
[13:17:28] <Toerkeium> I use ajaxStart to show a "please wait" when it takes longer than 1 second, but in a particular button I have an long ajax call which will show the user other information
[13:17:32] <robertmaxrees> sigdk do console.log(data) - what is thaat?
[13:18:15] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium i might, you could always create your own function that does all this.
[13:19:28] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: could you give an example?
[13:19:45] <robertmaxrees> not sure what about that is confusing heh
[13:21:19] <robertmaxrees> like - https://jsfiddle.net/3feaxruq/
[13:22:07] <Toerkeium> hmm not following you..
[13:22:16] <Toerkeium> anyway, I'll try to find some example of what you said
[13:22:26] <robertmaxrees> just shared one with you >.>
[13:22:34] <Toerkeium> thanks both guys
[13:22:50] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium why are you ignoring my example?! heh
[13:23:04] <jquery923> I'm trying to catch a click on an appended element, I'm using the correct delegate and it seems to work for all the other buttons, but this one that I append in a different function is not allowing me to click
[13:23:07] <sigdk> I have this behavior on a different system... I cannot do much with debugging. Any hint why is that error?
[13:23:13] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: I didn't, I just don't understand it
[13:23:17] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 mind showing us the code?
[13:23:29] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium so what donm't you undertstand? we're here ot help :)
[13:24:07] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: the construction of your script, I don't get it
[13:24:09] <jquery923> Yup, trying to make a smaller example so I don't have to send 500lines :)
[13:24:40] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium so instead of calling ajax directly, you'd call that script.
[13:25:38] <robertmaxrees> you'd give it whatever URL/data you'd need and tell it whether or not you want that thing to show.
[13:26:37] <jquery923> robertmaxrees, I'm gonna give you two links, since JSFiddle doesn't work with localstorage
[13:27:03] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 erm,, you question was about binding a delegated listener, not localStorage >.>
[13:27:32] <jquery923> Well I want to show the other buttons working but since I have LS conditionals you won't be able to see them unless I swap out the code
[13:27:49] <jquery923> Here's the link though: Line55 has the part I'm having an issue with: https://jsfiddle.net/5on46f1c/3/
[13:28:10] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[13:28:12] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of code
[13:28:18] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: can you modify my example fiddle?
[13:28:38] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium lol sure?  io'll give you a freebie today
[13:28:58] <jquery923> I know, but most of it is just conversation
[13:28:59] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: haha
[13:29:15] <Toerkeium> :)
[13:29:16] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 where do you bind the delegated listener?
[13:29:18] <jquery923> I'll give you the lines that do specific parts
[13:29:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:29:36] <robertmaxrees> why not just give me the specific parts that aren't working?
[13:29:37] <jquery923> binding is on line 93
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 so is that handler not alerting when you click the appended element?
[13:31:27] <JrWebDev> how do i basically get the javascript jquery always check an element if theirs changes...for instance i have a if statement...it only checks the if statement during the page load
[13:31:48] <JrWebDev> but i want it to always listen if theirs any changes
[13:32:08] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev mind describing the situation you're working on?
[13:32:23] <jquery923> Yes, the alert won't fire on the buttons appeneded in the "get username" function
[13:32:59] <robertmaxrees> and you've verified that get_userName() is actually firig?
[13:33:35] <jquery923> It should be because it's asking you for your name, which means the "users_name" key isn't valid in localstorage
[13:33:50] <jquery923> and when you have LS, it changes to confirming it is said user
[13:33:52] <JrWebDev> if ($(#div).is("hidden)) { //do something }  it will only do something if its hidden when i load the page..but if iget code to make the div hide it doesn't check and execute..just happens during the first page load
[13:34:27] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev if you're hiding it, you just modify the thing that hides it.  if something else it hiding it, check to see if they have callbacks to do that for you.
[13:34:36] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: don't forget my freebie
[13:34:39] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 this is such a huge test case...
[13:34:47] <jquery923> I will try to cut it down
[13:34:53] <jquery923> give me a few, sorry!
[13:34:54] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium i asked you to link your fiddle again.  but nmevermind.
[13:35:07] <Toerkeium> oh sorry, didn't see it
[13:35:11] <robertmaxrees> it's really pretty easyu.  instead of using ajaxsetup, you just create a convenience method that handles all of that for you.
[13:35:18] <Toerkeium> it's http://jsfiddle.net/SXkck/467/
[13:35:25] <robertmaxrees> nah - you can figure it out.
[13:35:54] <Toerkeium> my freebie is gone :(
[13:35:56] <Toerkeium> haha
[13:36:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about how my example isn't clear heh.  instead of using ajaxsetup and calling ajax directly, you just call that convenience method.
[13:36:56] <Toerkeium> but I'll have to call that method in every ajax call?
[13:37:03] <Toerkeium> that's how it works?
[13:37:10] <robertmaxrees> instead of every ajax call.
[13:37:18] <Toerkeium> ohh
[13:37:29] <robertmaxrees> "instead of using ajaxsetup and calling
[13:37:29] <robertmaxrees> ajax directly, you just call that convenience method.
[13:37:29] <Toerkeium> it's like a bypass function
[13:37:37] <robertmaxrees> it's a convenience function.
[13:37:50] <robertmaxrees> instead of juggling stuff in ajaxsetup you do things a little more explicitly.
[13:38:01] <Toerkeium> can't change the entire site
[13:38:08] <Toerkeium> there's lot of it done
[13:38:10] <Toerkeium> made
[13:38:33] <robertmaxrees> heh, wouldn't really be that hard, but ok.  you said it's always one particular URL that has issues, right?
[13:38:50] <Toerkeium> one particular button
[13:39:02] <Toerkeium> the rest shoudl trigger ajaxStart
[13:39:04] <robertmaxrees> lemme rephrase - do any other buttons call the same URL?
[13:39:05] <Toerkeium> normally
[13:39:23] <Toerkeium> hmm.. guess not, till now
[13:39:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:40:00] <jquery923> robertmaxrees, here is a much more trimmed up version :)
[13:40:17] <jquery923> https://jsfiddle.net/5on46f1c/6/
[13:40:22] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium so could you accurately say "this one url needs to be handled differently"?
[13:40:53] <Toerkeium> well.. I could, yes
[13:41:12] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium so then why not look at the URL being called within ajaxStart and go from there?>
[13:41:24] <Toerkeium> ah
[13:41:29] <Toerkeium> Didn't know I could do that
[13:41:42] <Toerkeium> inside ajaxStart?
[13:41:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:41:54] <Toerkeium> oh
[13:41:59] <robertmaxrees> the event object should have that info.
[13:42:03] <Toerkeium> nice
[13:42:07] <Toerkeium> great, I'll search about it
[13:42:10] <Toerkeium> thanks robertmaxrees!
[13:43:43] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: Mr Google says I should use ajaxSend to get URL
[13:44:13] <Toerkeium> inside ajaxStart I can't get access to the XHR object, apparently
[13:45:57] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean you can't get the url within ajaxStart.
[13:46:21] <robertmaxrees> $(document).ajaxStart(function(e) { console.log(e.currentTarget.URL) });
[13:46:25] <Toerkeium> how? if no argument is passed on ajaxStart?
[13:46:32] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> you pass the event object.
[13:46:44] <Toerkeium> ahhh
[13:46:48] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 so https://jsfiddle.net/5on46f1c/8/
[13:46:50] <robertmaxrees> this works.
[13:46:55] <robertmaxrees> your last example was missing a function call.
[13:47:01] <robertmaxrees> but this all looks like it should wortk fine.
[13:47:52] <jquery923> what function call did you add?
[13:48:09] <robertmaxrees> i remove the reference to it.
[13:48:18] <robertmaxrees> but your original fiddle works fine for me.
[13:48:29] <robertmaxrees> what's wrong with https://jsfiddle.net/5on46f1c/3/ ?
[13:48:47] <Toerkeium> so, having that URL, what's next? how do I disable ajaxStart?
[13:48:55] <Toerkeium> even if it's already started
[13:48:56] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium duder
[13:48:59] <Toerkeium> heh
[13:49:12] <robertmaxrees> gotta get out of the "how do I disable the handler" line of thinking.
[13:49:20] <Toerkeium> lol
[13:49:25] <robertmaxrees> you want "how do I not run the rest of the code"
[13:49:37] <robertmaxrees> don't touch the handler.  it's there.  but you can use conditionals.
[13:49:54] <robertmaxrees> if (!someThing) { theRestOfTheCode }
[13:50:39] <Toerkeium> but it's the same thing, if I use $(document).ajaxStart(function(e) { console.log(e.currentTarget.URL) }); it has already been started
[13:50:43] <jquery923> robertmaxrees, so that's what I was trying to solve, here is the version|https://codepen.io/TyStelmach/full/VbyJKP/ that shows my button is not clicking. I'm trying to add a localstorage if/else and this is the issue I keep running into. No matter when I append the buttons, I can't get it's value to work correctly
[13:51:04] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium this isn't hard...
[13:51:08] <Toerkeium> I should find the URL before ajaxStart triggers, and then use a condition to start or not ajaxStart
[13:51:13] <jquery923> (on the above example, you need to enter a name, then refresh so it shows the stage 2 dialog
[13:51:19] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium no.
[13:51:34] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium we've established that you don';t want to do that.
[13:51:41] <Toerkeium> yes
[13:52:26] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/89wvujf4/
[13:53:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 it doesn't "remember" my name >.>
[13:53:25] <Toerkeium> in your example, what would be "someFunctionCall()"?
[13:53:40] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium you'd replace that line with the code you currently have.
[13:53:51] <jquery923> robertmaxrees Really? it's working fine for me lol  Are you testing in incognito?
[13:53:52] <Toerkeium> ahh
[13:53:54] <Toerkeium> let me see
[13:53:57] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 nope.
[13:54:03] <jquery923> chrome?
[13:54:07] <robertmaxrees> and ff
[13:54:42] <jquery923> Ah yeah, doesn't work in fire fox I gues
[13:54:58] <robertmaxrees> i said "and ff" to imply that i tried chrome as well ;)
[13:55:27] <robertmaxrees> are you 100% sure get_username is doing what you think it's doing there?
[13:59:12] <jquery923> robertmaxrees  Oops, I accidentally removed the saveUser(); function call, could you try again please :)
[14:00:16] <robertmaxrees> there's the error.
[14:01:38] <jquery923> I'm not gettin an error in chrome or firebug?
[14:01:56] <robertmaxrees> i mean what you were talking about.
[14:02:00] <robertmaxrees> and i know what the issue is.
[14:02:08] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with your binding.,
[14:02:40] <jquery923> Oh okay, sorry just a little confused. See what I mean though? if you remove your users_name from LS, then go through all the buttons will work
[14:02:54] <jquery923> but when it pulls the dialog branch 2, those ones won't click hmm
[14:03:13] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ybjgPq
[14:03:23] <robertmaxrees> i added a console.log as the first thing in that ai function.,
[14:03:33] <robertmaxrees> it never gets called when it's a returning user.
[14:04:12] <jquery923> Yeah I'm not sure what's up with the localstorage conditional. I tried putting it in there and no dice
[14:04:13] <robertmaxrees> the only place you ever call ai() is when the user clicks on #sendMsg
[14:04:19] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: I'll have to use other identifier but I think it will work. I'll explore the object and see if there's something I could use
[14:04:23] <Toerkeium> thank you very much!
[14:04:57] <jquery923> this just in: I'm a dummy.
[14:05:14] <jquery923> literally facepalming myself into next week. jesus.
[14:06:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 ;)
[14:06:13] <robertmaxrees> always ask the most basic questions first.
[14:08:03] <jquery923> *simpson's meme of homer reading the book called "am i disabled"*  Literally me right now. Thanks for the help man, i know my example wasn't exactly ideal :p
[14:08:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:11:51] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: e.delegateTarget.activeElement.attributes.id gives me the ID of the button!
[14:11:55] <Toerkeium> excellent! many thanks!
[14:12:35] * robertmaxrees slaps dan_j around a bit with a large trout
[14:12:39] <robertmaxrees> woops!!!
[14:12:41] <robertmaxrees> hahahaa
[14:12:45] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium erm... okay.
[14:12:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd still do it bnased on the URL but OK.
[14:12:58] * MassDebates returned from a short trip in 90s memery
[14:13:14] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: found that I have a couple of buttons going to the same URL :P
[14:13:15] <Toerkeium> heh
[14:13:32] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium so wouldn't they all be slow?
[14:14:04] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees:  slow what?
[14:14:29] <Toerkeium> same URL, different POSTs
[14:14:42] <robertmaxrees> different post bodies, you mean?
[14:15:43] <Toerkeium> post dom elements
[14:15:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:15:57] <Toerkeium> heh
[14:15:58] <Toerkeium> what
[14:15:59] <robertmaxrees> "post dom elements" doesn't make sense.
[14:16:13] <robertmaxrees> you mean the data you're sending via post is different for each?
[14:16:13] <Toerkeium> form elements
[14:16:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the post body.
[14:16:19] <Toerkeium> yes, that
[14:16:33] <Toerkeium> :P
[14:16:51] <Toerkeium> do you see now why I didn't understood your first script?
[14:17:04] <robertmaxrees> it seems like you really need to revisit the basics heh
[14:17:18] <Toerkeium> yea
[14:17:26] <Toerkeium> I don't have a problem to do that
[14:17:31] <Toerkeium> my problem always is time
[14:17:48] <Toerkeium> anyway, I always end up doing nice things, if you don't look at the code
[14:18:12] <robertmaxrees> why don't you have time?
[14:18:38] <Toerkeium> too much work, not well remunerated
[14:18:50] <Toerkeium> it's the damn 3rd world
[14:18:55] <Toerkeium> where I live in
[14:18:57] <Toerkeium> :)
[14:19:25] <robertmaxrees> are you contracting out your work?
[14:19:40] <Toerkeium> what does that means?
[14:19:49] <robertmaxrees> like, are you a freelancer, or do you work for a company?
[14:19:58] <Toerkeium> for my own company, small one
[14:20:12] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, you contract out to buiild things for other people?
[14:20:19] <Toerkeium> yes
[14:20:29] <robertmaxrees> you need to start adding time to your estimates.
[14:20:37] <Toerkeium> but it's not my primary task
[14:20:44] <Toerkeium> developing this is like a favour
[14:20:48] <robertmaxrees> you'll get better quality work done that way.
[14:20:54] <Toerkeium> yeah
[14:21:05] <robertmaxrees> and have a chance to learn in the process.
[14:21:43] <Toerkeium> but that's a different subject, things over here are not quite well
[14:22:03] <Toerkeium> it's been like that since I was born anyway, it's normal to me :P
[14:22:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sayign they are or aren't well.  i'm just pointing out that it sounds like you're underestimating your work all the time.
[14:22:17] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty universal issue i see with a lot of devs.
[14:22:30] <Toerkeium> yes, I know I do
[14:23:08] <Toerkeium> sounds like that?
[14:23:13] <Toerkeium> hmm
[14:23:42] <robertmaxrees> just try adding a little padding here and there.  give yourself time to make higher quality work.
[14:24:35] <Toerkeium> yeah, sounds reasonable
[14:24:38] <Toerkeium> thanks for the advice
[14:24:58] <robertmaxrees> heck, most good freelancers/contractors I know double or even triple their time estimates.
[14:25:07] <Toerkeium> freetime, mostly to play piano
[14:25:09] <Toerkeium> hahah yes
[14:25:13] <Toerkeium> the ones I know do the same
[14:25:34] <robertmaxrees> heh, so afford yourself that same luxury :) you'll do much better work./
[14:26:31] <Toerkeium> I like many things to do
[14:26:34] <Toerkeium> that's a big problem also
[14:26:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm the same way!
[14:27:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm in a band, i work full time, got dogs, love to cook, social stuff, etc.
[14:27:36] <Toerkeium> same here, not a band but playing piano, I like to sail, do things at home, work, and I could continue
[14:28:03] <Toerkeium> electrincs also likes me very much but.. the same as jquery, I don't know sh*t about it, even there, I do some things
[14:28:03] <Toerkeium> heh
[14:28:12] <Toerkeium> how old are you?
[14:28:19] <robertmaxrees> if you start doing higher quality work, you can charge more per hour and then work a little less.
[14:28:22] <robertmaxrees> 30
[14:28:37] <Toerkeium> ah, youger
[14:28:40] <Toerkeium> I'm 42
[14:28:51] <robertmaxrees> heh doesn't mean i don't have a lot of stuff going on.
[14:28:58] <Toerkeium> sure it doesn't
[14:29:06] <Toerkeium> it was worse at my 30
[14:29:08] <jquery923> Hey robertmaxrees, quick follow up question, is there a reason that my LS keeps getting set at "undefined" even if I haven't entered anything?
[14:29:15] <Toerkeium> now i'm old :P
[14:29:19] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 no idea without seeing it again.
[14:29:27] <jquery923> 1 sec
[14:30:22] <Toerkeium> what do you play in the band?
[14:30:56] <jquery923> https://jsfiddle.net/aqbo5g9t/
[14:31:03] <robertmaxrees> guitar and I sing.
[14:31:20] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 so username = localStorage.getItem("users_name"); ?
[14:31:38] <robertmaxrees> or something else?
[14:31:40] <jquery923> Ah, I'm setting it before it exists?
[14:31:42] <Toerkeium> what kind of music?
[14:32:05] <jquery923> So I check whether they've entered it under get_username
[14:32:32] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium all kinds of stuff.  Play a bit of everything from the 50's to today.
[14:32:35] <jquery923> But it keeps setting it to undefined, so if they don't have one in the LS, then it always shows the else and calls them undefined
[14:33:04] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 still lost - where ae you seeing it say undefined?
[14:33:11] <robertmaxrees> \
[14:33:14] <Toerkeium> nice robertmaxrees!
[14:33:18] <jquery923> https://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/VbyJKP
[14:33:41] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium i'm personally really into blues, soul, R&B, motown, that kind of stufdf./
[14:34:03] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 so what's the replication prodedure for this bug?
[14:34:05] <Toerkeium> melancolic
[14:34:15] <robertmaxrees> nah, not melancholy at all.
[14:34:15] <jquery923> It should just happen
[14:34:20] <jquery923> is it calling you
[14:34:25] <jquery923> "undefined"
[14:34:26] <Toerkeium> I leaved blues long time ago
[14:34:27] <Toerkeium> heh
[14:34:40] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium most blues isn't sad fwiw.
[14:34:55] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 working fine for me here.
[14:35:07] <Toerkeium> yes, that's true
[14:35:10] <jquery923> Clear storage and try
[14:35:23] <Toerkeium> Anyway, about music, I go deeper in years every time
[14:35:34] <jquery923> mine keeps setting 'users_name' as undefined
[14:35:49] <Toerkeium> I'm a 1890 right now with chopin, and some jazz from 30's
[14:35:54] <robertmaxrees> cleared localstorage and tried ago jquery923
[14:36:13] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium nice.  i used to play tuba in symphonic band.  i was always a big fan of shostakovich.
[14:36:23] <jquery923> Are the buttons working as well ?
[14:36:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 newp.  got an updated pen?
[14:37:05] <Toerkeium> all music is wonderful, I'm just discovering that deeper you go, the better
[14:37:15] <jquery923> Well I'm calling ai(newMsg); in the on click function
[14:37:17] <jquery923> ill update pen
[14:37:40] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium i would argue that and say that the broader you explore, the more you can appreciate various styles.
[14:37:45] <jquery923> https://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/VbyJKP heres the updated pen
[14:38:04] <robertmaxrees> buttons still don't work.
[14:38:24] <jquery923> Yeah, ill set so buttons work, but then it like double sends messages
[14:39:13] <jquery923> https://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/VbyJKP
[14:39:18] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 i must be lost - how do i replicate the bug you're getting?
[14:39:27] <jquery923> buttons should work now, but it will double load on refresh
[14:40:16] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: I think the same.. but it just makes me go far deeper every time
[14:40:26] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 https://i.imgur.com/T3rJgwt.png so this?
[14:40:51] <Toerkeium> big fan of Tommy Bolin btw
[14:40:58] <jquery923> Yup, exactly :p
[14:41:06] <robertmaxrees> People People is a GREAT song Toerkeium
[14:41:14] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 one sec.
[14:41:18] <jquery923> I moved the "ai();
[14:41:19] <Toerkeium> hah
[14:41:26] <Toerkeium> have you heard Spectrum?
[14:41:29] <jquery923> into line 529, but that will double send
[14:41:46] <Toerkeium> damn, what he plays there, is just incredible
[14:43:14] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 well...
[14:43:17] <robertmaxrees> this is pretty obviousd.
[14:43:30] <robertmaxrees> that ai fuction again.
[14:43:31] <jquery923> of course it is hahah
[14:43:44] <robertmaxrees> you create that saveUser functiuon and then immediately run it.
[14:43:57] <jquery923> Ah, so I keep saving over it?
[14:44:06] <robertmaxrees> so you have get_username(); and then ai();
[14:44:37] <jquery923> yeah
[14:44:49] <jquery923> so I need to only run save user if the LS is set to null?
[14:44:52] <robertmaxrees> get_userName checks for that entry.  ai just saves whatever you handed it.
[14:45:09] <robertmaxrees> look at the declaration for ai - function ai(msg) {}
[14:45:29] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're passing things around oddly.
[14:45:43] <jquery923> Ai saves what is entered into msg / then passes the next set of text
[14:46:02] <robertmaxrees> you really want to call ai() from get_username()
[14:46:06] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess at least.
[14:46:16] <Toerkeium> gtg robertmaxrees, thank you for everything!
[14:46:23] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium yep.  good luck
[14:47:00] <Toerkeium> and listen Spectrum from Billie Cobhan if you didn't!
[14:47:26] <Toerkeium> Tommy Bolin, Jan Hammer and can't remember the bass player, amazing
[14:50:08] <jquery923> So if I run ai(); at the end of the "If LS == Null" conditional, it runs it all at once, its almost like its not seperating the if/else in get user
[14:51:40] <jquery923> this is where I'm at right now: https://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/VbyJKP
[15:13:11] <jquery923> any ideas robertmaxrees?
[15:18:58] <robertmaxrees> sorry.  had to stop away.
[15:20:43] <robertmaxrees> jquery923 you realize you'll probably have to split things up some more, right?
[15:21:09] <jquery923> No worries, yeah Im just not sure how I should be going about it
[15:21:22] <jquery923> since ai controls the entire conversation schema
[15:23:49] <robertmaxrees> heh you should really break things down more.
[15:24:07] <robertmaxrees> like, instead of doing that all inline, consider making an object of questions/answers.
[15:33:15] <jquery923> good point, I guess I'll start doing that. lol  Thanks again
[16:23:48] <torontoyes> Where might I find an example of html5 being used to rotate logos.. and what would this be called so I can look for it
[16:23:56] <torontoyes> not html5.. but javascript
[16:24:06] <robertmaxrees> and by "logos" you mean "
[16:24:12] <robertmaxrees> *"an image"?
[16:24:31] <torontoyes> exactly
[16:24:38] <robertmaxrees> why javascript?  why not cs?
[16:24:40] <robertmaxrees> *css
[16:24:54] <torontoyes> lets say you have 40 images.. you want them to pan through in a loop
[16:25:11] <robertmaxrees> "pan through in a loop"?
[16:25:12] <torontoyes> is that called carosel?
[16:25:21] <torontoyes> yes..
[16:25:21] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:25:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:25:34] <robertmaxrees> okay.  what does that have to do with rotating images?
[16:25:47] <torontoyes> maybe change the transitions for each image
[16:26:12] <torontoyes> or have some control over the transitions for each image
[16:26:12] <robertmaxrees> so you want to apply an effect when the image gets into view?
[16:26:21] <torontoyes> correct
[16:26:35] <torontoyes> so 2 things... 1 the images change, and I can apply a transition.
[16:26:40] <torontoyes> to be honest..I'd be happy with 1
[16:27:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd get a modal library and then add/remove css classes for the effects.
[16:28:16] <torontoyes> so is it reffred to as a carosel?
[16:28:41] <robertmaxrees> do you have an example of what youy're looking for?
[16:30:42] <robertmaxrees> something liiiike this? http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[16:34:09] <torontoyes> yes.. that without the arrows and radio buttons on the bottom.
[16:34:18] <torontoyes> Just want the images to autoplay
[16:34:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:34:47] <robertmaxrees> did you read what that site tells you?
[16:34:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:36:32] <torontoyes> lol.. no, I didn't.. so I'll read it.
[16:37:02] <robertmaxrees> long story short, carousels are kind of a bad thing and should generally be avoided.
[17:32:23] <torontoyes> exit
[18:55:06] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[19:17:17] <Me1of1> Hey there! Im puzzled by this issue Im facing, anyone is around so I could show the snippet? I'm sure it's short and simple problem for someone who knows what he's doing but Im just confused by its output :-/
[20:05:31] <robertmaxrees> Me1of1 i'm around.
[20:06:21] <Me1of1> robertmaxrees, ah nice! :) maybe you could give me an advice/heads up, Ive this JS snippet https://codepen.io/MarkCodeFu/pen/ZKoXEO and I expect it to iterate on each ".game-wrapper" and find the "rating" element and then do that rating assigning, but what happens instead is that it never iterates over the other 2 elements it just re-writes the same SVG rating to the very first ".rating" element 3 times any help is appreciated
[20:07:59] <robertmaxrees> Me1of1 well, it's pretty simple: circle = new window.ProgressBar.Circle('.' + $(this).find('.rating').attr('class'), {
[20:08:05] <robertmaxrees> so let's break that down real quick.
[20:08:13] <Me1of1> aha :)
[20:08:48] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('.rating').attr('class') returns 'rating', right?
[20:09:03] <Me1of1> aha exactly, 3 times as a matter of fact
[20:09:16] <Me1of1> as it should, but not the same one over and over
[20:09:39] <robertmaxrees> right.  so if it returns that, that line of code literally does the following: circle = new window.ProgressBar.Circle('.rating', {
[20:09:50] <robertmaxrees> which is why it's not doing what you want.
[20:10:07] <robertmaxrees> you're giving it the same class over and over.  you're not actually handing it the element you wnat.
[20:10:33] <Me1of1> hmm yeah that makes sense, I can see now why it overwrites the same element over and over
[20:10:58] <Me1of1> so the right way to do is find a way to iterate over these elements and then do the assignment?
[20:11:10] <robertmaxrees> you're already trying to do that.
[20:11:23] <robertmaxrees> got a link to the documentation for this?
[20:11:54] <robertmaxrees> ah, nevermind.
[20:11:54] <robertmaxrees> so!
[20:12:01] <robertmaxrees> http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/javascript.html#programmatic-use
[20:12:02] <Me1of1> yeah trying... but doesnt seem to work, robertmaxrees well I was reading on "find" and "each" function to figure it out
[20:12:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're conflating things :)
[20:12:22] <robertmaxrees> notice how that example does var $accordion = new Foundation.Accordion($('#accordion'), { ?
[20:12:35] <robertmaxrees> (different plugin, but the api should be roughly the same)
[20:13:02] <Me1of1> aha I did, Ive seen this sometime ago, I do in fact use these JS plugins to instantiate some of my Foundation plugins and customize them
[20:13:16] <robertmaxrees> right, the specific pluginm doesn't matter.
[20:13:25] <robertmaxrees> what matters is that argument they accept.
[20:13:48] <Me1of1> sure, they accept an argument that targets an element whether that be and ID, class, type etc
[20:13:49] <robertmaxrees> specifically, see how it takes $('#accordion') for the element?
[20:13:54] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:14:01] <robertmaxrees> so that means it can take a jquery object.
[20:14:09] <robertmaxrees> instead of passing a selector.
[20:14:42] <Me1of1> are you implying that I should be passing an object to this function instead?
[20:14:49] <robertmaxrees> a jquery object, yeah.
[20:14:51] <robertmaxrees> not a string.
[20:15:01] <robertmaxrees> circle = new window.ProgressBar.Circle('.' + $(this).find('.rating').attr('class'), { is trying to pass a string selector.
[20:15:22] <robertmaxrees> why not just give it the .rating element?
[20:16:03] <robertmaxrees> (there's a second issue here but we'll tackle that in a second.
[20:16:05] <robertmaxrees> )
[20:16:21] <Me1of1> well because as you can see it doesnt behave as expected when ".rating" is passed as an argument
[20:16:34] <robertmaxrees> right.  the string rating.
[20:16:38] <Me1of1> aha
[20:16:42] <robertmaxrees> why not just pass it the jquery object itself?
[20:16:54] <Me1of1> Im not sure how I'd do that :-/
[20:17:07] <robertmaxrees> well, how are you getting the current .rating?
[20:17:22] <Me1of1> by just passing the ".rating" class to it?
[20:17:31] <robertmaxrees> err, no.
[20:17:42] <robertmaxrees> you're doing $(this).find('.rating'), right?
[20:17:57] <Me1of1> yeah which ultimately results into ".rating" once all functions return their values
[20:18:10] <robertmaxrees> if you use .attr('class')
[20:18:26] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('.rating') gives you a jquery object.
[20:18:39] <Me1of1> aha it does, ive tried that before
[20:19:10] <robertmaxrees> so if that circle method can take a jquery object, and you've got the one you already want, what would you do instead?
[20:19:32] <Me1of1> pass the $(this).find('.rating') object instead?
[20:19:45] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[20:19:53] <robertmaxrees> so what would you now have?
[20:20:38] <Me1of1> $(this).find('.rating').attr('class'); ?
[20:20:53] <robertmaxrees> .attr('class') gives you a string though.
[20:20:56] <robertmaxrees> why are you including it?
[20:21:01] <Me1of1> ah yeah right!
[20:21:33] <robertmaxrees> so what would it look like if you should give it $(this).find('.rating') ?
[20:21:52] <Me1of1> that wouldn't work I think
[20:21:57] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[20:21:59] <robertmaxrees> the docs show that it does.
[20:22:16] <robertmaxrees> the js docs for foundation themselves show that you can do var $accordion = new Foundation.Accordion($('#accordion'), {
[20:22:21] <robertmaxrees> so why would circle be any different?
[20:23:03] <Me1of1> robertmaxrees, ive tried that couple hours ago, Im not sure why you're going after the Foundation docs as this is a stand alone jQuery plugin and it doesn't take an object
[20:23:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:23:26] <Me1of1> it has nothing to do how Foundation handles its native plugins
[20:23:27] <robertmaxrees> $(document).foundation(); implies it's foundationm.
[20:23:54] <Me1of1> yeah that line only instantiates the local plugins, but the circle thing has nothing to do with it
[20:24:07] <robertmaxrees> could you link me to the documentation for the Progressbar plugin then?
[20:24:13] <Me1of1> local foundation plugins, that's that, and then comes rest of the code
[20:24:17] <Me1of1> yeah sure, give me a sec pls
[20:24:50] <Me1of1> robertmaxrees, here it is http://kimmobrunfeldt.github.io/progressbar.js/ its quite short and simple I think
[20:26:12] <robertmaxrees> okay, so what did you try earlier that you said didn't work?
[20:26:59] <Me1of1> by passing it an object like this $(this).find('.progress'); it'd throw an error :-/
[20:27:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so according to the docs -> progressbarjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/shape/#new-shapecontainer-options
[20:27:27] <robertmaxrees> see the Parameters section there?
[20:27:43] <robertmaxrees> it says "container Element where SVG is added. Query string or element." and then "For example '#container' or document.getElementById('#container')"
[20:27:55] <robertmaxrees> so that means you need either a selector OR you need a DOM node.
[20:28:12] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense so far?
[20:28:35] <Me1of1> aha I see that :-/ yeah both cases are a bit unfortunate I think, yes they do, give me a sec I think I know what I can try
[20:28:43] <Me1of1> thanks for the heads up though
[20:28:48] <robertmaxrees> so jquery dives you access to the underlying DOM nodes.
[20:29:01] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/get/
[20:30:40] <Me1of1> thanks for the link, Ill read it up now :)
[20:31:22] <robertmaxrees> hint: circle = new window.ProgressBar.Circle($(this).find('.rating').get(0), {
[20:32:29] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:32:34] <robertmaxrees> plus there's another issue.
