[00:38:07] <zenman22> How can I periodically ajax update a list on my page without the user reloading the page? I'm using AngularJS - should I do it through Angular or is there a Jquery method?
[02:08:19] <Sephy> How do I use a .on('click') function within setInterval/setTimeout? I've tried it, but it doesn't work. - https://jsfiddle.net/Snowl/ooxpdt4s/
[02:27:26] <kneekoo> Sephy: it would probably be easier if you would say what (not how) you're trying to achieve (maybe comment the fiddle)
[02:31:15] <Sephy> It's a tad difficult to explain in the way that I want, but I can try to add comments explaining what I'm trying to do.
[02:34:58] <Sephy> I added in some comments, but I don't know how clear they're going to be.
[02:38:52] <kneekoo> the code was already self-explained, I still don't know the algorithm you want to implement
[02:39:30] <kneekoo> I don't understand why you would define an event every second
[02:39:46] <kneekoo> you should perform an action instead of that
[02:39:56] <Sephy> *shrugs* Not sure how to explain it, I guess, other than the fact that I'd like to use .on() to click something instead of .click().
[02:40:16] <kneekoo> but .on() defined an event listener
[02:40:52] <kneekoo> once you define it, it makes no sense to redefine it unless you update the HTML and you have to reapply it
[02:41:26] <Sephy> That's precisely it, I'm intending to use this for AJAX content that dynamically updates itself.
[02:47:12] <kneekoo> sorry, that code doesn't make sense to me :)
[02:47:36] <Sephy> Sigh. Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.
[02:47:38] <kneekoo> and if it's difficult for you to explain, then it's probably not clear enough for you either
[02:47:57] <Sephy> I mean, I understand what I'm trying to do, but eh.
[02:49:53] <kneekoo> when you have an issue like this, you have to forget about the code, because you're already stuck
[02:50:18] <kneekoo> just lay out the problem itself, step by step
[02:50:25] <kneekoo> that usually helps
[02:51:18] <kneekoo> unless you're trying to solve more problems at a time and they get in the way of the solution
[02:53:03] <shoky> it makes absolutely no sense to add that event handler multiple times.  .on() cannot be used to "click something instead of .click()"
[02:53:13] <shoky> Sephy ^
[02:53:45] <shoky> you MIGHT be looking for event delegation, it's hard to tell
[02:54:06] <shoky> explaining the problem (not the code) would help
[05:17:05] <mariuscc> can someone give me an idea why $('.some-class').on('click', function(){ });
[05:17:13] <mariuscc> isn't working for elements added on the fly ?

[06:08:40] <km4> hi
[06:09:00] <km4> should I edit this code ? http://paste.ofcode.org/XRPfUZMGssfbq5J9tiq6vc or it fine ?
[06:20:50] <Krisostoomus> hello
[06:21:54] <Krisostoomus> Please look https://www.smsjazz.net/test.php copy the upper date to input and click on the body afterwards. The date disappears from input box? why? how could I fix that?
[08:11:54] <only> hello, http://pastie.org/10911669 <- how do I make this submit the form just once?
[08:12:10] <only> the current result is that the page refreshes and submits the page ad infinitum
[08:25:37] <only> can anyone please help me make it autosubmit the form just once?
[08:31:31] <only> page refreshes on submit, obviously
[09:09:16] <Relequestual> Hi all. How do I use browserify to load jquery-ui from npm to load all of jquery-ui and not just the widgets?
[09:26:10] <shoky> Relequestual: what part are you missing?
[09:26:50] <Relequestual> seems all of the functionality. Only gives "widgets"
[09:27:03] <shoky> example?
[09:27:14] <Relequestual> sortable
[09:28:06] <shoky> that should work fine.. afaik only the css isn't loaded automatically by browserify.
[09:28:24] <shoky> how are you including jquery-ui exactly?
[09:29:03] <Relequestual> require('jquery-ui');
[09:30:12] <shoky> and how are you trying to use sortable
[09:31:34] <Relequestual> asking for a friend. how should I be using it? I don't have the code in front of me =/
[09:31:58] <Relequestual> .sortable
[09:34:26] <shoky> anyways, it's worked fine for me  with  var $ = require('jquery');  require('jquery-ui');  $(whatever).sortable();
[09:35:38] <Relequestual> shoky ok. thanks anyway. He has delved into this stuff and can't seem to get it to work how he wants at all =/
[09:37:10] <shoky> then he should ask for help himself ;)
[09:37:19] <Relequestual> mmm
[09:37:33] <Relequestual> I have to use my irc magic to help the lead dev sometimes ;)
[09:38:27] <shoky> that was definitely not what i'd call irc magic :)
[09:38:31] <Relequestual> hehe =]
[09:38:33] <Relequestual> true
[09:39:40] <Relequestual> it's normally with Perl DBIC stuff, because the authors of perl modules hang out on irc a lot
[09:41:51] <Relequestual> shoky which version of jquery-ui ? 1.12, your example, does not work.
[09:47:39] <shoky> Relequestual: i havent tried with the latest version,  i might've read that jquery-ui stable version doesnt fully work yet with new jquery 3, not sure.  so maybe try jquery 2
[09:48:40] <Relequestual> works in the browser fine
[10:25:11] <dwebber88> any comments on my custom modal script before i continue with some more details? i feel like it could be more efficient https://jsfiddle.net/7f63vekz/1/
[10:37:11] <BetaFrey> If i have a webpage, that has like 10 javascript scripts on it, if any of the links were wrong would it give me a console errror on page load if the script is acutally being used or do some scripts not give an error till an action that uses the script is preformed?
[10:39:04] <BetaFrey> I guess I mean to say, if anything on that page was using a script and the script URL was wrong would i get an error or do i need to pin point what on the page may be using it and if I find no errors then I can safely remove it from the file?
[10:45:00] <AcidRain> BetaFrey, if a url is wrong, u wont know until the script executes
[10:45:08] <AcidRain> if there are syntax errors, u will know when page loads
[10:48:00] <BetaFrey> Thanks AcidRain,
[10:50:03] <bongjovi> Can anyone tell me which is a better approach? https://jsfiddle.net/941bttsc/
[10:50:19] <bongjovi> apply a click handler to each element, or to a selector?
[10:52:16] <shoky> bongjovi: best approach is to use event delegation.  $('#container').on('click', '.linkClass', function..)
[10:52:21] <shoky> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[10:52:46] <shoky> there's hardly any difference between your two approaches
[10:52:58] <bongjovi> okay, that makes a lot more sense actually
[10:53:53] <bongjovi> thanks again shoky
[11:12:40] <greggg>  hi i use $('#id').html(v); v have <script src="http">  its evaled but it self add random number example ?_=1468941007285 can i disable it ? (i need use cache for this script
[11:12:56] <greggg> i cant information about it
[11:13:22] <dwebber88> that is not enough information to determine it
[11:18:41] <greggg> $(body).html('<script src="http://aaaa.js">'); browser run http://aaaa.js?_=1468941374512 why add random tag
[11:24:08] <dwebber88> its not your browser, its probably the framework that you're using
[11:26:06] <deez_nuts> does anyone know how i can call a function within a promise but without "function(xy)" :-)
[11:26:47] <deez_nuts> so i have this.blabla.then(function(resolvedObject){ dosomething()}
[11:26:56] <deez_nuts> which is in a for loop
[11:27:13] <deez_nuts> so i come across the lint "dont make functions within a loop"
[11:27:31] <deez_nuts> but then how do i construct this to get the resolved object ?
[11:35:19] <taplar> function myname(resolvedObject{ dosomething(); } this.blabla.then(myname)
[11:36:23] <taplar> greggg: jquery adds a timestamp or something when it loads external scripts, iirc
[11:37:47] <greggg> ok ii found - $.ajaxSetup({'cache':true});
[11:37:50] <greggg> now dont add
[11:37:57] <greggg> thanks
[11:38:24] <taplar> cool, not what i was referring to, but cool, :)  *keeps trying to find what he was referring to*
[11:42:29] <taplar> bah, i need coffee
[11:47:44] <greggg> taplar: i propose whiski it dont have any bacteries
[11:48:40] <taplar> ah, you need some bacteria to fight the other bacteria, :)
[11:49:19] <taplar> in that aspect, i am cultured.  haha!  biology joke
[11:49:41] <decx> science jokes huh
[11:49:49] <taplar> :D new frontier
[11:49:50] <decx> technically speaking, alcohol is a  solution
[11:49:56] <taplar> lmao
[11:49:59] <taplar> put that on a tshirt
[11:50:11] <graphettion> recording as a t-shirt idea
[11:50:28] <decx> i stole it from fallout 4
[11:50:35] <graphettion> :P
[12:24:48] <z1haze_work> how do you use off() with delegated event listeners
[12:25:01] <robertmaxrees> you call it on the parent you attached it to.
[12:25:09] <z1haze_work> so just off() on the parent?
[12:25:19] <z1haze_work> cool, i think
[12:25:20] <robertmaxrees> the one you attached to, yeah.
[12:25:23] <z1haze_work> thanks
[12:25:28] <robertmaxrees> though i'd ask why you're killing the listener.
[12:25:44] <z1haze_work> can of worms man, can of worms
[12:25:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest giving the target element a class and add/remove that instead.
[12:25:56] <robertmaxrees> less mental overhead.
[12:26:37] <z1haze_work> we have a product page, that displays a product with variations ,etc, so when you hover over a variation it updates a slider with new images, etc.. it was only designed to handle one instance of it on a page originally
[12:26:51] <robertmaxrees> hahaha sounds like where I work ;)
[12:26:53] <z1haze_work> now they want to be able to add this 'product bundle page' utilizing the same template for each product
[12:27:14] <z1haze_work> so the hover events are making stuff go nuts and changing stuff in other elements
[12:27:37] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't happen to work for a company that sells kegerators and stuff like that, would you?
[12:27:45] <z1haze_work> hehe
[12:27:47] <z1haze_work> nah
[12:28:02] <taplar> you rang?
[12:28:13] <robertmaxrees> hah fair enough.  and yeah,  you're building a feature that's almost identical to one we have.
[12:28:15] <z1haze_work> anyway, example i have going here: http://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site/default/Product-Show?pid=MJBlook01
[12:28:33] <z1haze_work> toward the bottom where all the dots are
[12:29:43] <z1haze_work> so i think I just want to kill any listeners because the code is garbage and ill just do my own little script tag on this page and be done with it
[12:30:00] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd talk about completely redoing it at that point
[12:30:01] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[12:30:26] <z1haze_work> I know its not the best way to do things, but last week i thought Id do some good by updating some javascript, spent 4 hours updating things, which just kept leading from one thing to another, basically it all got rolled back because it was 'too involved'
[12:30:48] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe you need to have a conversation about doing a cleanup.
[12:30:55] <z1haze_work> good luck with that
[12:31:14] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i've have a lot of success pitching ideas like that.
[12:31:19] <z1haze_work> the tech lead's idea of cleaning up code is comenting out old stuff because 'we might want it in the future'
[12:31:25] <z1haze_work> ive already tried man
[12:31:28] <z1haze_work> it needs entirely reworked
[12:31:35] <robertmaxrees> but... you have a vcs.  just delete the code D:
[12:31:39] <z1haze_work> this site was migrated from like a single app.js file
[12:31:48] <z1haze_work> lol it gets rolled back
[12:32:03] <robertmaxrees> that's really weird.
[12:32:19] <decx> i just hope your robots blocks indexing all those separate quickview pages
[12:32:26] <z1haze_work> well unfortunately this woman doesnt understand 90% of the things that happen, and she's our tech lead on the project
[12:32:54] <z1haze_work> they are generated server side before page load so ad assume so
[12:33:10] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean your robots blocks them >.>
[12:33:23] <z1haze_work> im moving to my own project as soon as this site build is done, so i just want to get through it
[12:33:29] <decx> gotta keep that index nice and tidy
[12:33:57] <z1haze_work> I'll be the dedicated dev for the puma site which is cool
[12:46:41] <z1haze_work> keep getting kicked off
[12:47:40] <taplar> Survivor mentality
[13:03:38] <z1haze_work> i cant figure out how to make this work with multiple instances of this element
[13:04:56] <z1haze_work> http://dpaste.com/2QX2FA1 is the mess of a file im working in, and i believe all the stuff im working with is in the module.exports function at the bottom
[13:05:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:05:31] <robertmaxrees> if (typeof ga === "undefined") {} else {
[13:05:58] <robertmaxrees> could you narrow down what you're asking?
[13:06:10] <z1haze_work> i didnt write this :(
[13:06:17] <robertmaxrees> like, tossing out 150 lines of code and then saying "it's broken" isn't really helpful.
[13:07:27] <z1haze_work> so much is wrong :\ but ok for starters
[13:07:47] <z1haze_work> there are multiple instances of .pdp-main on the page now
[13:08:02] <z1haze_work> which there are multiple sliders, multiple variation elements, etc
[13:08:08] <z1haze_work> and the linked i showed earlier, is the result
[13:09:07] <z1haze_work> would give someone a seizure trying to hover over variations
[13:09:50] <robertmaxrees> here, try this: "Right now, the page is doing x, but it needs to do y.  the specific code that i'm having trouble with is here at www.z.com"
[13:10:14] <z1haze_work> z1haze_work
[13:10:14] <z1haze_work> anyway, example i have going here: http://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site/default/Product-Show?pid=MJ...
[13:10:47] <z1haze_work> what is supposed to happen is if you hover over a 'dot' (variation) the product images in the slider and the name of the product variation should update PER product
[13:11:04] <z1haze_work> instead what is happening, is its updating all of them at once
[13:11:12] <robertmaxrees> right, because var $pdpMain = $('.pdp-main');
[13:11:18] <z1haze_work> correct
[13:11:23] <z1haze_work> how am i supposed to make that per element
[13:11:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to init against each specific one instead.
[13:11:44] <z1haze_work> how?
[13:12:26] <robertmaxrees> triple check to make sure your handlers are all bound to the correct elements and that the $(this) is what you think it is.
[13:12:44] <robertmaxrees> also: $pdpMain.on('mouseenter', 'productvariation',function(){ won't ever match anything.
[13:12:57] <z1haze_work> yea some moron didnt put a .
[13:13:17] <z1haze_work> its been that way for ages i msure they coudlnt figure it out and did it another way and just left this old stuff here
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> also: I might look to see what #product-content should be.
[13:13:36] <robertmaxrees> are there supposed to be multiples of that, or...?
[13:13:40] <robertmaxrees> like, i'm flying blind here.
[13:13:42] <robertmaxrees> just tossing out ideas.
[13:13:47] <z1haze_work> i know, i appreciate it
[13:14:12] <z1haze_work> im fairly blind to it also. zero people who wrote any of this work here and its nearly impossible to find anything that makes sense
[13:14:45] <robertmaxrees> except that you have access to the sources and a debugger ;)
[13:14:48] <robertmaxrees> I don't have the sources.
[13:14:58] <z1haze_work> they are mapped
[13:15:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd start using console.log() and your step debugger and see what's up.
[13:15:48] <z1haze_work> i dont know hwo to use the script debugger to be honest, i kinda just picked up on the front end stuff not too long ago
[13:16:07] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 has a GREAT guide :)
[13:17:57] <z1haze_work> can you tell me why after you mouse over a swatch, when you mouse out, you get 2 default names in there instead of just the original
[13:18:16] <z1haze_work> its adding spitlight 700 from below to the current name
[13:18:21] <z1haze_work> but its not adding the third one..
[13:18:29] <robertmaxrees> where does that happen in the code?
[13:18:35] <robertmaxrees> don't make me fully run through it all duder.
[13:18:53] <z1haze_work> line 92 ish
[13:19:08] <z1haze_work> well line 108 specfically for the mouseout
[13:19:33] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('.pdp-main').find(".variation-label-value").text(defaultName); var defaultName = $(".variation-label-value").text();.
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> you're not getting the .variation-label-value that's related to where the event fired from for starters.
[13:20:33] <z1haze_work> i added the this.closest part today
[13:20:55] <z1haze_work> but i didnt know what to do about the default declaration
[13:20:58] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change the problem i pointed out.
[13:21:04] <z1haze_work> i dont know what to do about it
[13:21:21] <z1haze_work> its not like im initing some jquery plugin object its just in the module.export
[13:21:28] <z1haze_work> and its saying grab the .pdp-main etc
[13:21:31] <robertmaxrees> er.
[13:21:36] <robertmaxrees> you're really lost heh.
[13:21:40] <z1haze_work> yes
[13:21:50] <z1haze_work> i need to call this specicially for each .pdp-main element
[13:21:52] <robertmaxrees> you need to find another way to store the default info so you can properly grab it in the mouseenter/mouseleave
[13:22:00] <z1haze_work> but how am i supposed to do that when its inited this way
[13:22:02] <robertmaxrees> because what you're doing today isn't working.
[13:22:18] <robertmaxrees> stick it in a data attribute somewhere for each of these.
[13:22:21] <robertmaxrees> or something else.
[13:22:27] <z1haze_work> well my issue is theres no event fired when its set
[13:22:33] <robertmaxrees> so?
[13:22:33] <z1haze_work> so theres nothing to trigger to say hey it belongs to this
[13:22:42] <robertmaxrees> you don't need that.
[13:23:09] <robertmaxrees> you'd init it like that in your backend.  then you can update it as necessary in response to user interaction.
[13:23:37] <z1haze_work> and robertmaxrees when you hover over the element you get the correct name to show up, but when you remove hover it adds a random one in there
[13:23:47] <z1haze_work> AND the original
[13:23:55] <z1haze_work> im asking why does it add 2 lines on mouseleave
[13:24:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm giving you things to look at.
[13:24:37] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting me to take a crack at it and try to fix it?
[13:26:07] <z1haze_work> i just am at a loss, dont have a direction to go in
[13:26:13] <robertmaxrees> i gave you a place to start.
[13:26:20] <robertmaxrees> you need to associate defaults somewhere.
[13:27:47] <z1haze_work> i want to rewrite this stuff but even if i rewrite it, how do i create like a object for each instance, like if it were a plugin object or something
[13:27:57] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to.
[13:28:21] <robertmaxrees> earlier you were saying you couldn't really rewrite much, now you're saying to want to rewrite it (shrug)
[13:28:28] <taplar> data-* is awesome.  automatic scope
[13:28:32] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:29:01] <z1haze_work> i dont see how its giong to help with a data attr
[13:29:10] <z1haze_work> all these elements have the same names
[13:29:15] <robertmaxrees> you stick the default value in a data attribute on the parent element for the "widget" or whatever.
[13:29:26] <robertmaxrees> then you have the default for later
[13:29:49] <z1haze_work> .. on mouseout i want to revert back, how would a data atribute help me revert back to the previous name
[13:30:06] <robertmaxrees> on mouseout you grab the parent that has the data attribute and use that value./
[13:30:14] <z1haze_work> no
[13:30:16] <z1haze_work> it doesnt
[13:30:22] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want to do.
[13:30:25] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm saying.
[13:30:42] <z1haze_work> no im saying the data isnt coming from the parent
[13:30:52] <robertmaxrees> right, you stick it there via your backend.
[13:30:56] <robertmaxrees> when you render the page out.
[13:30:56] <z1haze_work> its from whever sibling is current selected
[13:31:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you just add it via js when needed.
[13:31:22] <robertmaxrees> dude, i've built EXACTLY what you're trying to make right now.
[13:31:27] <z1haze_work> can i see
[13:31:49] <robertmaxrees> our v2 is a helluvalot cleaner than our v1 and our v1 sucks.
[13:31:53] <robertmaxrees> so take my word for it :)
[13:32:01] <robertmaxrees> plus our v2 uses backbone views to organize all of it.
[13:32:21] <robertmaxrees> falling short of that, just set a data attribute on that parent element that has the value you want to fall back to.
[13:32:25] <robertmaxrees> on mouseout, grab that value.
[13:38:07] <z1haze_work> backbone would be the way to go on this, or some sort of model
[13:38:19] <z1haze_work> or just build it like a plugin
[13:46:22] <ckb> On a blur trigger, is there a way to tell if the user ‘clicked’ on an element with a common element as the input?
[13:46:56] <robertmaxrees> backbone would be the way to go on this, or some sort of model"
[13:47:01] <robertmaxrees> backbone has models fwiw.
[13:47:15] <robertmaxrees> ckb not without holding state somewhere.
[13:48:21] <ckb> robertmaxrees: explain a little further please?
[13:48:38] <ckb> like e.target on the blur event?
[13:49:24] <robertmaxrees> ckb they're two unrelated concepts.  a click and a blur have their own scopes, so you don't know anything without explicitly storing it elsewhere.  could you maybe clarify what you're trying to accomplish?
[13:50:34] <ckb> robertmaxrees: I have 2 elements. search bar and search results. I’m wanting to hide the results if the user clicks outside of the search results box, however but NOT if the user clicks INSIDE.
[13:50:58] <ckb> I guess I could bind document.click…
[13:51:12] <taplar> sounds like you want to stop the propagation of clicks inside
[13:51:14] <ckb> then e.target has said common parent
[13:51:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd do a single delegated listener on the document and see if $(e.target).closest('theContainer').length > 0
[13:51:46] <ckb> hm… good point. I’ll just prevent any clicks from going PAST the search results..
[13:52:02] <robertmaxrees> no need to go that far.
[13:52:13] <ckb> that way I can delegate different things inside the search results.
[13:53:14] <ckb> I have different behaviors for different search bars. and I do stop propagation on clicks throughout… so it’s easier to just prevent any click from making it past the search results. as everything gets delegated to #search-results anyways
[13:53:48] <robertmaxrees> i avoid stopping propagation so i don't accidentally break our analytics and because there's usually no reason to, but alright
[13:54:27] <ckb> one other question… if I stop propagation on an anchor.. at an ancestor, will the browser still follow the link or does it have to make it to the document?
[13:56:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u2xf1eay/
[13:56:53] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to find out :)
[13:57:15] <robertmaxrees> something else is broken there though.
[13:57:50] <robertmaxrees> wtf why is is broken
[13:58:16] <robertmaxrees> weird.  either way, it'll still follow the link.
[14:03:41] <taplar> doesn't for moi
[14:03:48] <robertmaxrees> that fiddle is broken.
[14:03:53] <robertmaxrees> comment out the stoppropagation
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u2xf1eay/1/
[14:04:09] <robertmaxrees> is better.
[14:06:28] <taplar> makes sense
[14:35:24] <joshL_> I'm having trouble installing 1.12.4 with npm
[14:44:49] <z1haze_work> for mouseover, mouseout functions, do I have access to variables created in the mouseover part in the mouseout part?
[14:53:29] <joshL_> is it possible to install jquery 1.x with npm? I'm having trouble installing 1.12.4 via npm "npm ERR! 404  '1.12.4' is not in the npm registry."
[14:57:26] <ChrisBinge> if I have a name attribute with a multi array on my input, how can I extract and store the key of the array in a variable?
[14:58:09] <ChrisBinge> i.e. var myvar = array[ineedthis][notthis]
[15:01:12] <BetaFrey> robertmaxrees:  I know you sent me a link with jquery the other day I was wondering if you had any knowledge of the head first jquery / javascript books
[15:35:54] <z1haze_work> So i'm having somewhat of success after reworking this file
[15:36:09] <z1haze_work> But I am generating an error but the console isnt pointing me to the correct location for some reason
[15:36:20] <z1haze_work> http://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site/default/Product-Show?pid=MJBlook01 here's what i've got now it mostly works now
[15:37:56] <z1haze_work> just have a typeerror of t.find is not a function but i dont use any code of t.find, im assuming its just confused as where to point. any ideas?
[15:38:09] <z1haze_work> the error occurs with hovering over a swatch
[17:03:58] <ChrisBinge> how would you guys extract the key from a named array? i.e. name="array[key][stuff]"
[17:04:09] <robertmaxrees> that's not an array.
[17:04:22] <robertmaxrees> and that's just a string.
[17:05:18] <ChrisBinge> your right, was thinking about it from the backend perspective
[17:05:41] <ChrisBinge> just regex anything between the first []?
[17:05:57] <robertmaxrees> why not use data attributes insteaD?
[17:06:20] <ChrisBinge> I guess because I haven't
[17:06:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:06:33] <ChrisBinge> i'll have to look into how they work
[17:06:44] <robertmaxrees> data-name="foo" data-key="bar" data-value="baz"
[17:06:57] <robertmaxrees> then in jquery $('.theElement').data('name');
[17:06:57] <robertmaxrees> etc
[17:07:39] <ChrisBinge> yeah that seems simple enough, just wondering how to utilize that on the php end
[17:07:51] <robertmaxrees> php just populates those attributes.
[17:07:57] <robertmaxrees> instead of using name
[17:09:02] <ChrisBinge> I see, yeah.. because the values of the inputs are what are being posted anyways
[17:09:22] <ChrisBinge> doesn't change the structure there at all really just the population
[17:09:23] <robertmaxrees> well, wait - are you doing a normal post?
[17:09:49] <ChrisBinge> with dynamically added inputs, yes
[17:09:57] <robertmaxrees> so not ajax?
[17:10:29] <ChrisBinge> not ajax, but I'd like to learn that and impliment at some point
[17:10:42] <robertmaxrees> so then the name attribute IS relevant.
[17:12:15] <ChrisBinge> so back to regex the name attribute to pick out whatever is between the first []?
[17:12:36] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm confused about why your name attributes are structured like that.
[17:12:37] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:12:51] <robertmaxrees> like, it'd make more sense on the frontend to use data attributes since they'd be easier to read.
[17:14:57] <ChrisBinge> yeah, I liked that look and how that looks semantically on the front end, just trying to figure out how to make it play nicely with the php
[17:15:26] <taplar> you might check to see if php will auto parse names like 'a.b.c' into associative arrays
[17:15:29] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to have something that digests the inputs and maps them to whatever they tie into in your backend.
[17:15:39] <robertmaxrees> ^ or check out taplar's suggestion./
[17:15:51] <robertmaxrees> but rarely do you want to actually have like full object accessors as your names.
[17:16:08] <robertmaxrees> that's awfully trusting of the data you're getting from your frontend :)
[17:16:32] <ChrisBinge> well that key is just going to be an auto incrimenting number
[17:16:51] <taplar> are you using it just for grouping?
[17:16:57] <ChrisBinge> yeah
[17:17:45] <taplar> yeah, checkout if php will auto parse dot notation
[17:18:03] <taplar> otherwise have your back end take the # off the name and find the other related pieces on the $_GET or $_POST
[17:18:05] <robertmaxrees> or look into mapping input names to actual data.
[17:19:39] <ChrisBinge> well the reason I want to save the count into a variable is to group created inputs (give them the same number) as the dynamically created section with an incrimented number
[17:19:56] <robertmaxrees> are you submitting multiple forms at once?
[17:20:06] <robertmaxrees> or are you trying to group sets of inputs together?
[17:20:11] <ChrisBinge> grouping sets
[17:20:26] <robertmaxrees> and how are you using that number on your frotnend?
[17:20:28] <robertmaxrees> (frontend
[17:20:51] <ChrisBinge> number has no use on frontend, just to group them so I can display them grouped
[17:21:24] <robertmaxrees> ah, so your question is a PHP question.
[17:22:09] <ChrisBinge> no because I am getting the number in js from the dynamically created inputs
[17:22:55] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaaaah i get it :) when you create a group of inputs, give them a parent container then just use the .length to get the number.
[17:24:38] <ChrisBinge> hmm .length
[17:24:48] <taplar> or if you have the ability to remove them, just have a running incrementor
[17:24:57] <ChrisBinge> I do have the remove
[17:25:05] <robertmaxrees> he needs the names on the inputs though.
[17:25:06] <ChrisBinge> what do you mean running incrementor
[17:25:08] <taplar> since you said your just using them for grouping, your not concerned with the #  being contiguous
[17:25:16] <ChrisBinge> nope
[17:25:24] <robertmaxrees> ah good point.
[17:25:30] <taplar> just some var scoped high enough that you always +1 to
[17:26:53] <ChrisBinge> right, because my concern now is when I submit the form whatever number is used will be the key, now on a different session would I potentially run into saving the same key?
[17:27:03] <robertmaxrees> you can't trust that key.
[17:27:05] <robertmaxrees> ever.
[17:27:13] <ChrisBinge> right
[17:27:15] <robertmaxrees> for global uniqueness i mean.
[17:27:32] <taplar> ugh
[17:28:18] <robertmaxrees> i might look into like, not allowing the base form to submit but building an object that you pop into a hidden input that you send over.
[17:28:24] <taplar> 'using as the key' =/= only for grouping, :)
[17:28:37] <robertmaxrees> if only because constructing an array would be the best option here/
[17:29:19] <taplar> arrays of a, b, c, where you know a[0] goes with b[0] ...
[17:29:35] <robertmaxrees> not even that.
[17:29:55] <robertmaxrees> an array where each index is an object representing the data from a group.
[17:30:15] <taplar> ah, i thought he was doing plain form submits though
[17:30:19] <robertmaxrees> he is.
[17:30:24] <robertmaxrees> that's why you cancel the original form.
[17:30:44] <robertmaxrees> and use that to instead build an object, pop that into a hidden input elsewhere, and then submit the hidden form.
[17:31:48] <taplar> that'd be cool
[17:32:22] <taplar> wouldn't even need the grouping then.  they markup (tr possibly?) would be your grouping mechanism
[17:32:28] <taplar> they=the
[17:32:43] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:33:00] <taplar> ChrisBinge: clear as mud?
[17:33:13] <ChrisBinge> heh yup
[17:33:36] <robertmaxrees> i know it's a little over-engineered BUT when you go on to do your ajax version you just point that data using an ajax call instead.
[17:33:59] <ChrisBinge> what about passing the highest number of the count from php as the beginning of my count?
[17:34:06] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:34:09] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:34:20] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to worry about that at that point.
[17:34:38] <robertmaxrees> now you can just insert things to your DB.
[17:35:18] <taplar> as far as keys are concerned you want something more unique, like a database timestamp that is an index or something.  or one of their incrementing indices.  something not determined by the user
[17:35:31] <robertmaxrees> or php
[17:36:01] <taplar> you insert the data, then fetch it to get the new id
[17:36:45] <ChrisBinge> insert to db, then fetch back with ajax?
[17:37:06] <robertmaxrees> if you're doing a normal form post, no need for ajax.
[17:37:12] <robertmaxrees> though do you actually need the ID to come back?
[17:37:36] <taplar> probably if he can continue to edit
[17:38:05] <robertmaxrees> then if it's a normal form submit, you just nab data back as appropriate.
[17:38:07] <taplar> kinda funny.  i've done ajax for so long, i've kinda forgotten all these concerns, lol
[17:38:27] <z1haze_work> how can i debug a specific js function in chrome dev tools
[17:38:41] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work the link I sent you earlier shows you how :)
[17:38:54] <ChrisBinge> should I maybe look into learning ajax to do this
[17:39:09] <robertmaxrees> ChrisBinge i'd worry about getting your MVP done :)
[17:39:23] <ChrisBinge> mvp?
[17:39:29] <robertmaxrees> minimum viable product.
[17:39:45] <ChrisBinge> good point, I get distracted easily
[17:39:49] <robertmaxrees> we all do.
[17:39:55] <robertmaxrees> (if you haven't notiched :) )
[17:39:58] <robertmaxrees> *noticed
[17:40:00] <ChrisBinge> haha
[17:40:02] <taplar> it's not called gold plating for nothing
[17:40:54] <ChrisBinge> alright i've got a function that creates the "section" with an input to name that section, and another function to add more inputs
[17:41:03] <ChrisBinge> they need to be linked via an id
[17:41:12] <ChrisBinge> so a DB timestamp sounds like a good idea
[17:41:32] <robertmaxrees> your DB should have a primary key you could use.
[17:42:37] <ChrisBinge> well it's a multidimensional array that is being saved as a serialized array
[17:42:53] <taplar> ugh
[17:43:07] <taplar> your storing multiple inputs in a single db column?
[17:43:22] <robertmaxrees> each row in your DB should correspond with a single group of inputs.
[17:43:27] <ChrisBinge> it makes sense because I am using wordpress meta boxes
[17:43:28] <robertmaxrees> and each input shouw be one column.
[17:43:49] <robertmaxrees> *should
[17:43:54] <ChrisBinge> this is the best way to do it within that framework
[17:44:11] <robertmaxrees> you lose literally all the benefit of using a relational DB with that.
[17:44:11] <ChrisBinge> otherwise yeah, that structure would be much easier
[17:45:01] <taplar> not to mention to change one value you have to update the whole thing
[17:45:06] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:45:31] <ChrisBinge> yeah, I actually delete the whole thing and resave it on form submit
[17:45:37] <robertmaxrees> holy shit.
[17:46:00] <taplar> you mean, the whole record?
[17:46:04] <ChrisBinge> yeah
[17:46:10] <robertmaxrees> that'
[17:46:11] <taplar> so your generating a new primary id each time?
[17:46:13] <robertmaxrees> *that's really scary.
[17:46:56] <ChrisBinge> well that is why I should manually updating the count could be viable
[17:47:00] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:47:07] <robertmaxrees> that explains a whole lot heh.
[17:47:10] <taplar> no, dude.  don't delete it for an update
[17:47:13] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[17:47:20] <robertmaxrees> don't delete things out of your db in general.
[17:48:44] <ChrisBinge> so if I update, given the structure what would be the best way to create a unique id
[17:48:56] <taplar> your primary id is your unique id
[17:49:02] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees ... that was like a 70 page slideshow i cant go through that at work
[17:49:04] <taplar> that's what that means
[17:49:18] <taplar> a primary id is a unique id that db's use to index their records for easy access
[17:49:24] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work but you can sit in irc long enough for me to explain it?
[17:49:32] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide10
[17:49:34] <robertmaxrees> here you go.
[17:49:48] <z1haze_work> im making progress though, 90% finished, only thing remaining is the hover zoom thing is still showing up the same per product
[17:49:50] <ChrisBinge> right, but there is only 1 row with 1 primary id
[17:50:00] <taplar> every row has a primary id
[17:50:10] <taplar> a primary id is a column on every record
[17:50:33] <taplar> or are you saying you have one record that has every single record in it?
[17:50:34] <ChrisBinge> right, but it is all saved to 1 row
[17:50:40] <ChrisBinge> yea
[17:50:43] <taplar> wtf?!
[17:50:44] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:50:48] <robertmaxrees> ChrisBinge noooo
[17:50:48] <z1haze_work> and robertmaxrees i knew this much.. i figured there was some option to step through the function rather than just jumping from one function to another
[17:50:50] <taplar> lol, i can't help you there dude
[17:50:56] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work there is.
[17:51:04] <robertmaxrees> there is a step debugger built in.
[17:51:19] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work you have to "step into" instead of "over".
[17:51:25] <robertmaxrees> the link i sent you explains that.
[17:52:03] <robertmaxrees> ChrisBinge yeah, you really need to rethink your entire approach.  you're basically trying to use MySQL (I'm assuming) as a document store, not as an RDB
[17:52:24] <robertmaxrees> storing all data in a single column in a single row is a bad idea.
[17:52:49] <taplar> might as well write it to a flat file
[17:52:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:53:13] <taplar> which i am not saying you should, :)
[17:53:20] <robertmaxrees> (that's actually a bad idea)
[17:53:23] <taplar> yep
[17:53:46] <robertmaxrees> you're going to wind up fighting with that setup forever.
[17:53:51] <robertmaxrees> you already are.
[17:54:06] <taplar> solving self imposed problems
[17:54:29] <taplar> doctor, it hurts when i punch myself
[17:54:39] <ChrisBinge> lol
[17:55:01] <ChrisBinge> looking into how I save it now
[17:55:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah when things wind up feeling that difficult, it's time to step back and figure out what about the process made it that way.
[17:56:31] <taplar> first step, in this case, i would say would be to re-identify your primary key.  your db layout will most likely need to be altered
[17:57:00] <ChrisBinge> yeah, stepping back and thinking about it now
[17:57:15] <taplar> whiteboards are kewl, :D
[17:57:38] <ChrisBinge> haha for sure
[17:57:53] <robertmaxrees> ^ yus.  i share a whiteboard table thing with my team lead.
[17:57:55] <robertmaxrees> it's good times.
[17:58:24] <taplar> we have a shared one in our cubbie area and a big one in an adjacent open air meeting room.
[17:58:33] <taplar> its not uncommon to hear someone say 'take a photo of that'
[17:58:59] <robertmaxrees> we have a yuge one on one of the walls iun the sodev area and every meeting room has a few, too.
[17:59:38] <robertmaxrees> we have a strip of small meeting rooms with windows that we use as whiteboards, too.
[18:01:05] <taplar> lol
[18:01:32] <taplar> for the short time one of my groups had windows we used a few for posties
[18:02:05] <taplar> actually still have windows with this group, but the sun is killer so the blinds are closed
[18:02:20] <robertmaxrees> ah.  yeah, these windows are actually inside.
[18:02:58] <taplar> bah, fancy inside window person
[18:03:08] <robertmaxrees> we're weird.
[18:04:07] <taplar> didn't have to explain.  the bear said it all
[18:04:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:04:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah....
[18:09:11] <taplar> kinda funny that we ran into that.  i'm playing around with some hybrid mysql tables that have a column with json data
[18:09:19] <taplar> read only though
[18:09:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there's a "right way" to use document stores.
[18:10:00] <taplar> yeah, i'd use mongodb if i could but bluehost doesn't offer it
[18:10:07] <robertmaxrees> or couch
[18:10:15] <taplar> i use couch all the time
[18:10:17] <taplar> wait...
[18:10:57] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:10:58] <taplar> :D  hadn't heard of this one
[18:11:02] <robertmaxrees> couchdb?
[18:11:09] <taplar> ya
[18:12:17] <taplar> it is still on the backend right?
[18:12:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:24:22] <Markthemark> could i get a help on this? https://dpaste.de/FdUy
[19:24:32] <Markthemark> what does the ajax function say it does?
[19:26:09] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:26:11] <robertmaxrees> are you confused?
[19:26:49] <robertmaxrees> Markthemark  it's sending somme form data immediately
[19:27:01] <Markthemark> um
[19:27:10] <Markthemark> im using django
[19:27:14] <robertmaxrees> do you want it to wait until the user has submitted the form?
[19:27:22] <Markthemark> sure,
[19:27:27] <robertmaxrees> django makes literally no difference :)
[19:27:31] <robertmaxrees> that's backend.
[19:27:37] <robertmaxrees> so you need to setup an event handler.
[19:27:40] <Markthemark> how should i fix the form and the script anywyas
[19:27:54] <Markthemark> do you know about django?
[19:28:06] <robertmaxrees> i know about it, but that has literally nothing to do with your question :)
[19:28:19] <Markthemark> well, i think it has something to do with it because
[19:28:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.  not with why it's broken.
[19:28:28] <Markthemark> it renders html if i go to http://mtode.com/social
[19:28:42] <robertmaxrees> also, you're not loading jquery there.
[19:28:53] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, it's rendering.  that has nothing to do with your ajax issue ;)
[19:28:56] <Markthemark> yeah this is the code i got from SO
[19:29:02] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[19:29:07] <Markthemark> so could you help me understand?
[19:29:11] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:29:17] <Markthemark> let me add jquery first though
[19:29:18] <robertmaxrees> well i'd start by making a valid html page.
[19:29:29] <robertmaxrees> with a doctype, <head>, etc.
[19:34:13] <Markthemark> urm, im trying to import the jquery, but it’s throwing me an django error
[19:34:16] <Markthemark> Invalid block tag on line 17: 'static'. Did you forget to register or load this tag?
[19:34:21] <Markthemark> do you happen to know why?
[19:34:47] <Markthemark> guess i will have to ask in #django brb
[19:39:27] <Markthemark> robertmaxrees: https://dpaste.de/SgAZ
[19:41:14] <robertmaxrees> you update http://mtode.com/social/ ?
[19:41:26] <Markthemark> no i can’t because the server’s not responding.
[19:41:29] <Markthemark> im doing it locally.
[19:42:29] <robertmaxrees> you need to load jquery before you try to use it.
[19:42:37] <robertmaxrees> so <script src='{% static "js/jquery.js" %}'></script> needs to be before your ajax call.
[19:42:57] <Markthemark> okay.
[19:43:12] <robertmaxrees> next, http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/
[19:43:21] <robertmaxrees> you need to setup an event listener for form submit events.
[19:43:23] <Markthemark> how do i connect the script to the post form and the button though?
[19:43:25] <Markthemark> okay
[19:44:00] <cannap> xD
[19:44:15] <robertmaxrees> that'll look something like $('form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault() /* your code here */ });
[19:44:37] <Markthemark> where are we using on. instead of just jquery,click?
[19:44:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:44:51] <cannap> lol
[19:45:05] <cannap> you should use .on('event'..
[19:45:08] <cannap> every where
[19:45:15] <robertmaxrees> .click() actually just uses .on('click', under the hood
[19:45:33] <robertmaxrees> you should favor .on() generally
[19:45:38] <Markthemark> okay
[19:45:46] <cannap> because touch
[19:45:46] <Markthemark> i remember using it for the dynamic contents
[19:45:49] <Markthemark> but
[19:45:50] <Markthemark> sec.
[19:45:51] <Markthemark> https://dpaste.de/bXcB
[19:45:54] <Markthemark> is this correct then?
[19:46:00] <robertmaxrees> .on() has anbother syntax for dynamically added elements, yes.
[19:46:05] <robertmaxrees> and no.
[19:46:12] <robertmaxrees> because your code runs before the form exists.
[19:46:16] <robertmaxrees> you need a document ready as well.
[19:46:22] <robertmaxrees> or more all of your code before the closing body tag.
[19:46:22] <Markthemark> ah..
[19:46:23] <robertmaxrees> either/or.
[19:46:34] <Markthemark> so i shall move the whole thing to the bottom
[19:46:40] <robertmaxrees> and clean up your code formatting!
[19:46:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:46:56] <cannap> hf
[19:46:58] <cannap> :P
[19:47:47] <Markthemark> how do i clean up the code format?
[19:47:50] <Markthemark> im using ATOM
[19:47:59] <robertmaxrees> indent it correctly.
[19:48:20] <cannap> ctrl + alt + l works?
[19:48:24] <cannap> or f
[19:48:26] <robertmaxrees> sure?  no idea.
[19:48:27] <Markthemark> https://dpaste.de/tYZV
[19:48:43] <robertmaxrees> you cannot put anything between head and body.
[19:48:47] <robertmaxrees> it needs to be in head or in body.
[19:48:59] <robertmaxrees> put jquery right before your custom script.
[19:49:17] <Markthemark> sorry.
[19:49:18] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't need to use doc ready since you're already putting the code before the closing body tag.
[19:49:19] <Markthemark> didn’t check
[19:49:21] <cannap> wow this i scar
[19:49:21] <cannap> y
[19:49:25] <robertmaxrees> you do one or the other.
[19:49:31] <robertmaxrees> cannap heh, take it easy on the guy.
[19:49:34] <Markthemark> done.
[19:49:37] <robertmaxrees> obviously just starting out.
[19:49:42] <robertmaxrees> Markthemark that should work.
[19:50:30] <Markthemark> okay. thanks. i will comeback if that doesn’t work, for some reason it’s throwing me another django error
[19:51:46] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[19:51:49] <Markthemark> data: $('#login_form').serialize(), what is this for btw?
[19:51:55] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:51:57] <Markthemark> what is that #login_form?
[19:52:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:52:09] <robertmaxrees> so you really need to do a tutorial.
[19:52:13] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a great guide.
[19:52:18] <robertmaxrees> but that's called a selector.
[19:52:21] <robertmaxrees> just like with CSS.
[19:52:22] <Markthemark> i mean i already kno wthat.
[19:52:31] <Markthemark> but im not sure why it’s there :p
[19:52:35] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[19:52:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:52:45] <Markthemark> thanks for the kind explanation though :p
[19:52:52] <robertmaxrees> if you knew what they're used for, you'd know what it's there for :)
[19:53:02] <robertmaxrees> it's getting an element with the ID login_form
[19:53:17] <Markthemark> it’s turning the data into JSON
[19:53:21] <Markthemark> or not
[19:53:35] <Markthemark> okay so i was rather wondering
[19:53:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:53:36] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[19:53:40] <robertmaxrees> Description: Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission.
[19:53:44] <Markthemark> if it’s the login form id
[19:53:51] <Markthemark> or the div id for content showing
[19:53:58] <cannap> ah damn sry i forgot here is jquery xD
[19:54:07] <robertmaxrees> it would be the ID for the form more than likely.
[19:54:12] <Markthemark> okay
[19:54:13] <Markthemark> thanks.!
[19:54:16] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:56:20] <flyz_> hi, is this the problem solving channel?
[19:56:29] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[19:56:39] <robertmaxrees> flyz_ are you looking for general support for #jquery?
[19:57:04] <flyz_> yeah i got an ajax request problem
[19:57:17] <robertmaxrees> if it's jquery related, this is the right place :)
[19:57:33] <flyz_> great:)
[19:59:03] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?
[19:59:44] <flyz_> well i need to make a post request via ajax to a json-rcp server, normally it should give me a json string back but all it does is giving me the "response for greeting" -> Hello World
[19:59:51] <flyz_> this is the request:
[19:59:59] <robertmaxrees> make sure you use a paste service btw :)
[20:00:02] <flyz_> jQuery.ajax("http://192.168.1.13:80/", { 	contentType: "application/json", 	crossDomain: true, 	dataType: "jsonp", 	data: {"id":1,"method":"get_containers","params":{}}, 	type: "POST", 	success: function(response){         	console.log("device control succeeded" + response); 	}, 	error: function(){          	console.log("Device control failed");      }     });
[20:00:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:00:07] <robertmaxrees> try again :)
[20:01:20] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/3da8576d2cb1
[20:01:23] <robertmaxrees> ;_
[20:01:26] <flyz_> and the error i get:  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier  ?callback=jQuery1124047…_1468972509104&id=1&method=get_containers&_=1468972509105:1         Device control failed
[20:01:45] <flyz_> what was the problem?
[20:01:57] <robertmaxrees> don't paste code in the channel.
[20:01:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:02:14] <robertmaxrees> so now that i can read the code, i see you're doing dataType: "jsonp"
[20:02:19] <robertmaxrees> does the remove server actually support jsonp?
[20:02:29] <flyz_> oh sry
[20:02:43] <flyz_> yeah it should
[20:02:56] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[20:03:00] <robertmaxrees> because it doesn't sound like it does.
[20:03:02] <flyz_> i can send you the code, its just a short virtualmachine you can start with node.js
[20:03:07] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:03:09] <robertmaxrees> please don't heh
[20:03:18] <robertmaxrees> what is the actual response you're getting back?
[20:03:51] <cannap> 500 internal errorz
[20:04:02] <flyz_> https://bpaste.net/show/249f32ba69e8
[20:04:07] <flyz_> the machine
[20:04:12] <robertmaxrees> aaaand again
[20:04:16] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual raw response?
[20:05:25] <flyz_> http://prntscr.com/bv11pf
[20:05:29] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[20:05:33] <robertmaxrees> that's not the response
[20:05:45] <robertmaxrees> go to your network tab and click the request that you're making.
[20:05:49] <cannap> you made a coe mistake
[20:05:53] <flyz_> http://prntscr.com/bv11vc
[20:05:55] <cannap> code/*
[20:06:05] <robertmaxrees> cannap in the response there's an issue.
[20:06:17] <robertmaxrees> flyz_ that's not JSONP
[20:06:22] <robertmaxrees> that's raw data.
[20:06:33] <flyz_> ok where do i find it
[20:06:34] <flyz_> sry
[20:06:38] <robertmaxrees> you did find it.
[20:06:50] <robertmaxrees> you can't just use jsonp and expect it to work.
[20:06:57] <flyz_> ok..
[20:07:08] <flyz_> can i convert it to a json string or plain text?
[20:07:08] <robertmaxrees> are you planning on doing this particular request cross-domain?
[20:07:41] <flyz_> well it is a webinterface to manage virtual machines
[20:07:54] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't tell me anything :)
[20:07:57] <flyz_> so yeah its probably cross-doamin
[20:08:15] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[20:08:22] <flyz_> yeah:)
[20:08:31] <robertmaxrees> is http://192.168.1.13:80/ different from the URL of the page this code is on?
[20:09:03] <flyz_> well 192.168.1.13 is the url the server (virtualmachine) is running on
[20:09:18] <robertmaxrees> where is the page getting served from?
[20:09:19] <flyz_> an i had this script running oin nother computer yeah
[20:09:23] <cannap> do you make this requests from crome=
[20:09:33] <cannap> chrome
[20:09:36] <robertmaxrees> cannap yo duder, we already covered that ;)
[20:09:43] <cannap> ah
[20:09:48] <flyz_> yeah, but i tried firefox too because chrome was trying to block cross-domain
[20:09:49] <cannap> i was not sure
[20:09:50] <cannap> xD
[20:09:52] <robertmaxrees> flyz_ what computer it's running on is different from the URL you're serving on :)
[20:10:03] <robertmaxrees> flyz_ right, because cross-domain can be dangerous if you're not careful.
[20:10:17] <flyz_> i have the script on my dekstop pc and the server is running on my laptop in the msae network
[20:10:28] <flyz_> just for testing and learning :)
[20:10:38] <robertmaxrees> and you're running via a local server, right?
[20:10:46] <flyz_> yeah
[20:10:50] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[20:11:00] <flyz_> the server is just a script running via node.js
[20:11:04] <robertmaxrees> is any of this going to be exposed to the internet at large?
[20:11:13] <flyz_> probably not:)
[20:11:18] <robertmaxrees> then look into enabling cors.
[20:11:43] <robertmaxrees> then you can ditch contentType: "application/json", crossDomain: true, and dataType: "jsonp",
[20:12:04] <cannap> but dont do this in production
[20:12:06] <robertmaxrees> those can all be automatically determined by jquery when needed.
[20:12:16] <robertmaxrees> cannap he can do it in production if it'll never be exposed to the internet at large.
[20:12:35] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.  we can cover that in a second though :)
[20:12:43] <cannap> wow your reponses very fast
[20:12:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:13:26] <cannap> next time i ask you when i have a problem :D
[20:13:27] <flyz_> ok, ill try to ditch out thoses 3
[20:13:41] <robertmaxrees> flyz_ i would look at enabling cors for that particular endpoint, too.
[20:13:46] <robertmaxrees> that'll fix that problem.
[20:13:50] <flyz_> how do i do it?
[20:14:05] <robertmaxrees> depends on the server.  plenty of reading material on the internet for it :)
[20:15:28] <flyz_> ok, this is going to be a long night xD
[20:15:35] <flyz_> thanks a lot guys:)
[20:15:51] <robertmaxrees> definitely.  lots of reading and learning ahead :)
[20:15:56] <robertmaxrees> be careful with that cors stuff btw.,
[20:16:02] <flyz_> why?
[20:16:05] <robertmaxrees> you can open a major security hole if you're not careful.
[20:16:17] <robertmaxrees> and give people outside your network access to things they shouldn't have.
[20:16:20] <flyz_> oh..
[20:16:34] <robertmaxrees> make sure you check the domain the request originated from before allowing it.
[20:20:51] <Grizmix> Can someone help me with a jQuery problem?
[20:21:43] <robertmaxrees> Grizmix yep.
[20:22:54] <Grizmix> so.. i have this page http://slotogifts.x10.mx and I'm using two different versions of jQuery, but one version stops working.
[20:23:13] <Grizmix> I was trying to figure out how the conflict works
[20:23:15] <robertmaxrees> soooo.
[20:23:22] <Grizmix> but I've had no success ><
[20:23:22] <cannap> because you use 2x jquery
[20:23:28] <robertmaxrees> you need to only use one.
[20:23:40] <Grizmix> but the other script won't work when i do that.
[20:23:46] <robertmaxrees> then update it :)
[20:23:57] <cannap> or use migrate
[20:23:58] <Grizmix> I don't know how, I did not write it.
[20:24:07] <cannap> k.
[20:24:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:24:16] <robertmaxrees> then learn?
[20:24:21] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you need noConflict.
[20:24:23] <Grizmix> I'm trying..
[20:24:39] <cannap> harder first remove one jquery
[20:25:12] <Grizmix> k removed the older version
[20:25:12] <cannap> you need ie9 support?
[20:25:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:25:21] <cannap> yea
[20:25:22] <robertmaxrees> cannap
[20:25:31] <cannap> what
[20:25:40] <cannap> i try to help xD
[20:25:41] <Grizmix> I suppose that would not hurt
[20:26:01] <robertmaxrees> just move to jquery 1.11 or greater.
[20:26:07] <robertmaxrees> and fix the errors you get.
[20:26:15] <Grizmix> how do i check for erros?
[20:26:18] <Grizmix> errors?
[20:26:20] <robertmaxrees> your console
[20:26:35] <Grizmix> this is all new to me, well javascript and jquery
[20:26:45] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a great time to learn! :)
[20:27:03] <Grizmix> I am very slowly ><
[20:27:05] <cannap> jquery = js
[20:27:10] <Grizmix> CSS was much easier =D
[20:27:13] <cannap> but simpler to use
[20:27:21] <taplar> i'm questioning why someone new to js and jquery is working on something they didn't write, without in house support?
[20:27:27] <cannap> css != jquery
[20:27:35] <cannap> you can modify css with jquery
[20:28:12] <robertmaxrees> cannap he's not saying css and jquery are anythinbg alike....
[20:28:14] <Grizmix> Someone wrote a script for me and the other was free
[20:28:24] <robertmaxrees> Grizmix yeah, sounds like ou need to do some learning then :)
[20:28:30] <cannap> good
[20:28:48] <Grizmix> I'm just trying to figure out the conflict.
[20:28:56] <Grizmix> I am learning.. what would you like me to do?
[20:28:57] <robertmaxrees> if you open your console, you'll see the erro.
[20:29:06] <robertmaxrees> basically, you're loading a new version and then an old one.
[20:29:06] <cannap> f12^^
[20:29:21] <robertmaxrees> when the old one runs, it replaces what $ means.
[20:29:26] <cannap> yea sry i now shut the fuck up
[20:29:37] <robertmaxrees> so then you try to use things like .on(), but that didn't exist until 1.8 - you're loading 1.4
[20:31:29] <Grizmix> I'm seeing uncaught syntax error on line 18
[20:31:33] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:31:59] <robertmaxrees> because ar jquery-1.11.0.min.js = jQuery.noConflict();   isn't what you want.
[20:32:04] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use noconflict.
[20:32:18] <Grizmix> k I'm learning now
[20:32:21] <Grizmix> =D
[20:32:43] <robertmaxrees> var newjQuery = jQuery.noConflict();
[20:32:44] <robertmaxrees> that would work.
[20:32:47] <Grizmix> I did a google search for it and that is what came up so yea lol
[20:32:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?  where did you see that?
[20:33:35] <robertmaxrees> and why spend all the time getting this (really bad) solution to work that'll just create more problems when instead you could just update all your deprecated code?
[20:33:58] <robertmaxrees> like, what happens when you kill <script src="http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.4.2.min.js"></script>?
[20:34:16] <cannap> lol
[20:34:31] <Grizmix> saw it here http://web.enavu.com/daily-tip/using-multiple-versions-of-jquery-on-the-same-page/
[20:34:40] <cannap> remove http_
[20:34:42] <cannap> :
[20:34:51] <robertmaxrees> Grizmix that page says to do var $jq = jQuery.noConflict();
[20:34:57] <robertmaxrees> not what you had.
[20:35:47] <Grizmix> If i kill the 1.4.2 then my $(this).find('img.change').prop('src', 'mainchecked.jpg') will not function
[20:35:56] <robertmaxrees> what does it tell you?
[20:36:04] <robertmaxrees> like, let's fix that instea.d
[20:37:24] <Grizmix> Yea, I want to learn more about this but no idea where to start. I appreciate the help, it's hard to find.
[20:37:32] <robertmaxrees> it's easy actually :)
[20:37:38] <taplar> what do you mean 'will not function'?
[20:37:48] <robertmaxrees> i know what the issue is.
[20:37:51] <taplar> k
[20:37:52] <Grizmix> the image will not change after being clicked
[20:37:59] <robertmaxrees> because your script.js breaks.
[20:38:18] <Grizmix> oh?
[20:38:25] <robertmaxrees> delete the old version of jquery, and in script.js replace $('#feedback a.submit').live('click',function(){ with $(document).on('click', '#feedback a.submit', function(){
[20:38:27] <Grizmix> because of the old version?
[20:38:27] <robertmaxrees> done
[20:38:42] <robertmaxrees> kill the noconflict, kill the old version of jquery, and that's all you need.
[20:39:00] <robertmaxrees> because .live() doesn't exist in newer versions of jquery.
[20:40:05] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't fix it, open your console and fix the next problem.
[20:41:32] <Grizmix> omg i love you
[20:41:39] <Grizmix> <3
[20:41:47] <robertmaxrees> fwiw the jquery docs tell you all of this.
[20:42:13] <Grizmix> where do i find these?
[20:42:19] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com
[20:42:21] <Grizmix> or where do you suggest is a good place to learn?
[20:42:26] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[20:42:30] <cannap> he rober do you know vuejs?
[20:42:35] <robertmaxrees> cannap nope.
[20:42:35] <cannap> sry robertmaxrees
[20:42:56] <cannap> k :D
[20:43:07] <robertmaxrees> i know of it.
[20:43:12] <cannap> yea
[20:43:24] <Grizmix> Thank you very much for your help! I really do appreciate it, now I'm going to read up on jQuery.
[20:43:30] <robertmaxrees> enjoy :)
[20:43:46] <cannap> just asked because i mean damn you help everyone in here
[20:43:52] <cannap> every day
[20:44:03] <cannap> amazing :D
[20:44:29] <Grizmix> Helping people is a great thing.
[20:44:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:44:40] <Grizmix> That is the main purpose to my site.
[20:44:40] <robertmaxrees> plus i learn a bit more each day.
[20:44:51] <Grizmix> same here
[20:44:51] <cannap> yea sure
[20:44:58] <robertmaxrees> Grizmix huh?  your slots site?
[20:45:02] <Grizmix> I typically learn the hard way first though ><
[20:45:04] <robertmaxrees> or whatever it is.
[20:45:11] <Grizmix> yes, it's for facebook
[20:45:20] <cannap> we dont start with calculator ;:O
[20:45:30] <Grizmix> each of those boxes leads to COINS
[20:45:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused - how's that helping people?
[20:45:48] <cannap> whaz
[20:45:54] <cannap> what
[20:45:57] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean to learn!
[20:45:58] <Grizmix> like if you click a box it gives the person 20,000 coins to use in the slot game
[20:45:58] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[20:46:07] <robertmaxrees> "the slot game"?
[20:46:08] <Grizmix> or more etc..
[20:46:11] <Grizmix> yes
[20:46:21] <robertmaxrees> that sounds pretty generic.
[20:46:32] <robertmaxrees> but alright.
[20:46:33] <Grizmix> And majority of people that play there are elderly
[20:46:41] <cannap> oO
[20:46:44] <robertmaxrees> heh, whatever helps you feel better :)
[20:47:07] <Grizmix> but I was planning to add an auto feature so they don't have to click every box
[20:47:23] <robertmaxrees> so then why not just give them a link that is "get all your free coins"?
[20:47:28] <cannap> interval trigger
[20:47:47] <Grizmix> yea, just opens a popup and cycles each link
[20:47:51] <robertmaxrees> and this seems odd - is the main app okay with you doing that?
[20:48:07] <cannap> cheater
[20:48:11] <Grizmix> lol
[20:48:12] <Grizmix> no
[20:48:17] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[20:48:21] <robertmaxrees> so you're abusing the service?
[20:48:27] <Grizmix> they are free
[20:48:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked ;)
[20:48:35] <Grizmix> given out by the company
[20:48:43] <cannap> cheating
[20:48:48] <cannap> free or not
[20:48:52] <robertmaxrees> cannap yo, no need to say that.
[20:49:05] <robertmaxrees> don't need to be hostile to people.
[20:49:15] <cannap> cheat! :D
[20:49:23] <Grizmix> So they are cheating? https://gamehunters.club/slotomania-slot-machines/share-links
[20:49:32] <robertmaxrees> Grizmix I'd be careful is all.
[20:49:51] <robertmaxrees> sites like that get shut down or prevented accesss all the time.
[20:50:18] <cannap> he knows he will cheat also np
[20:50:31] <Grizmix> But I've actually spoken to Slotomania
[20:50:36] <robertmaxrees> hey, no need to be hostile, cannap
[20:50:48] <robertmaxrees> Grizmix so they're cool with it?
[20:51:01] <Grizmix> Yes, it does not breach the TOS.
[20:51:08] <Grizmix> Anyone can get these coins
[20:51:08] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[20:51:15] <robertmaxrees> not all services are like that.
[20:51:21] <robertmaxrees> just something to be aware of in the future :)
[20:51:30] <robertmaxrees> slot game on FB?  no big deal.
[20:51:45] <robertmaxrees> mining data that's on a site because it's "publicly available"?  not ok :)
[20:51:55] <Grizmix> no not mining any data
[20:52:33] <Grizmix> every link that someone clicks on my site has been provided by Slotomania
[20:52:44] <robertmaxrees> lol it's not a big deal, yo.
[20:52:49] <robertmaxrees> if they're cool with it, it's fine.
[20:52:57] <Grizmix> lol you making me feel bad
[20:53:01] <Grizmix> ><
[20:53:15] <robertmaxrees> nah.  if they said it's cool, you're a-ok.
[20:53:15] <cannap> you should
[20:53:44] <Grizmix> Might as well just close the site.
[20:53:47] <robertmaxrees> you're not doing anything wrong if they;'re fine with it.
[20:53:55] <robertmaxrees> nah dude.
[20:53:59] <robertmaxrees> don't let him get you down.
[20:54:01] <robertmaxrees> you're fine.
[20:54:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:54:39] <Grizmix> Thanks for your help again, going to read up and try to learn more.

[20:54:47] <Grizmix> Good day!
[20:54:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely.  Good luck! :)
[20:54:50] <cannap> yea i made a joke sry @Grizmix
[20:54:57] <cannap> sometimes
[20:54:59] <cannap> oh
[20:55:59] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go home.  enjoy.
[20:59:32] <flyz_> hey me again, i tried to config cors, but it not realy working: http://prntscr.com/bv1j0w
[21:03:59] <cannap> do you send this via ajax
[21:04:04] <cannap> to a other server?
[21:04:20] <cannap> chrome has some security stuff
[21:04:25] <cannap> this will never work
[21:04:35] <cannap> you need to set some flags
[21:05:04] <cannap> or try this plugin https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi
[21:05:14] <cannap> not sure this will work anymore
[21:05:53] <cannap> you can send this stuff via a server
[21:06:01] <cannap> but not from chrome local
[21:06:59] <cannap> or check http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35432749/disable-web-security-in-chrome-48-and-49
[21:07:25] <cannap> @flyz_,
[21:08:08] <flyz_> fixed the origin one, but i still wonder why post/jquery has an nternal server error
[21:08:26] <cannap> not jquery has the internal
[21:08:35] <cannap> the server response internal
[21:08:41] <cannap> is internal
[21:09:13] <cannap> i dont know what you want to do
[21:09:26] <cannap> but you can send a request from your browser to a other server
[21:09:36] <cannap> you need to setup a own server todo this
[21:09:44] <cannap> cant*
[21:09:58] <cannap> you can do this on the same domain you visit
[21:10:30] <cannap> small example your are on google.com you cant send a request to bing.com from google.com
[21:10:46] <cannap> bechause i restricted on the current website
[21:11:01] <cannap> this would be a big security hole when this is possible
[21:12:03] <cannap> sry my shit english i hope you understand what i mean
[23:11:41] <Markthemark> $('.login_div').text(username)
[23:11:44] <Markthemark> does this make any sense at all?
[23:13:05] <D-rex> after i use npm to install a package do I have to manually copy packages to my web app?
[23:13:51] <D-rex> is there a way to instal them directly to my js asset folder?
