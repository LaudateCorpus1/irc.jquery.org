[00:41:41] <Varun_krishna> Hi all how to change the color of the button in jquery mobile 1.4.2 ?
[01:33:16] <aro> if i have an element in $var and i append that to another element $('#element') - how would i perform a jquery function on the appended element after it is appended?
[01:33:30] <aro> i assume doing $var.fn.whatever(); will not work since it is already appended
[01:45:49] <danux> guys i have added all the js just above the body tag and after that  $(document).ready stopped working , how to fix this
[02:09:26] <aro> if i have an element in $var and i append that to another element $('#element') - how would i perform a jquery function on the appended element after it is appended?
[02:09:34] <aro> i assume doing $var.fn.whatever(); will not work since it is already appended
[02:55:29] <cornernote> hi
[02:56:08] <cornernote> i have a strange issue... i am using $('#order-form').is(':hidden'); in FF and Chrome... FF says false and chrome says true

[03:04:05] <Dogamondo> Hey all
[03:04:22] <no_gravity> hi Dogamondo! whats your startup?
[03:04:34] <aro> if i have an element in $var and i append that to another element $('#element') - how would i perform a jquery function on the appended element after it is appended?
[03:04:35] <aro> i assume doing $var.fn.whatever(); will not work since it is already appended
[03:05:03] <no_gravity> aro: show some actual code
[03:05:07] <Dogamondo> no_gravity: no startup yet mate
[03:05:32] <Dogamondo> just wanting some jQuery help
[03:06:18] <no_gravity> Dogamondo: lets go
[03:07:10] <Dogamondo> ok so I guess this is pretty basic
[03:07:34] <Dogamondo> I want to target all the anchor’s in a div
[03:08:02] <Dogamondo> and change the href attributes of each link
[03:08:18] <Dogamondo> to the title that I’ve given each <a>
[03:09:26] <Dogamondo> so for example <a title=“#link” href=“http://www.somelink.com/“>
[03:10:06] <Dogamondo> I want to change every <a> element’s link to its title, immediately on $(document).ready();
[03:10:13] <And1> Good morning folks! I need some help please. I'd like to change line 8 so it gives the class ".error" to my div with the id "#include". http://jsfiddle.net/TdHnp/
[03:12:09] <no_gravity> Dogamondo: i have almost no clue about jquery but i would think $("#yourdiv a").forEach(function (d) {d.href=d.title}) or something
[03:12:47] <Dogamondo> ah cool
[03:12:50] <Dogamondo> I’ll try that
[03:27:32] <abishek> does someone know of a throttle plugin that works with the latest jquery version
[03:27:57] <abishek> like http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[04:15:03] <CrowX-> If I have a css class that covers multiple div elements, is there a way to add an event to those elements so that the style of all the members of that class will be changed in a way, except for the specific element the event is called from? Without giving every element a specific ID
[05:43:12] <hxm> hi
[05:45:56] <hxm> i have a class with a li with a ahref each one

[07:07:28] <DanS-> need help
[07:07:30] <DanS-> plssss
[07:09:43] <DanS-> im trying to load
[07:09:43] <DanS-> http://fotis.co/projects/simpletabs/
[07:09:52] <DanS-> but im noob at it
[07:29:11] <frojnd> This site: http://www.mocky.io/ claims that you can create a simple mocks for testing rest clients, so for example this url: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5336d65a695d393f0757446a will throw some random text. How can I use this for implementing in jquery ajax rest client? It has just plain text as output nothing what I've red json uses :)
[07:29:20] <frojnd> hi there
[07:36:18] <DanS-> can someone help me load a jquery
[07:46:01] <VeetaPhone> ok, let's do this
[07:47:56] <systemfault> ‘sup cheesy phone
[07:49:21] <VeetaPhone> nada.. sitting at the wife's eye exam
[07:49:48] <VeetaPhone> watching the incredible.. one of the greatest of the pixar fleet
[07:49:58] <VeetaPhone> incredibles*
[07:50:13] <systemfault> Great :)
[07:51:47] <DanS-> this channel sucks
[07:51:50] <DanS-> #css is way cooler
[07:53:45] <VeetaPhone> cool story, bro
[07:56:13] <frojnd> Can somoene help me with beginnings at retrieving json data agains rest service?
[07:57:23] <VeetaPhone> you should just be able to use $.ajax to hit your endpoint
[07:57:44] <VeetaPhone> couple that with a success callback to handle the response
[08:03:00] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: I got stuck at how to represent data back to html: this is hello.js http://sprunge.us/CjOe
[08:03:31] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: and this is index.html http://sprunge.us/GbcZ
[08:03:55] <frojnd> I belive the calls for retreiving that "text" url are right
[08:04:00] <frojnd> correct*
[08:04:17] <frojnd> It's a very very basic a few lines
[08:05:13] <VeetaPhone> so your dataType attribute should just say 'json'
[08:05:14] <frojnd> this is more correct hello.js http://sprunge.us/CKTV
[08:05:21] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: ok
[08:06:07] <VeetaPhone> and you're injecting your response in as html, but it's just gonna render the json data in your page, if you're fetching json
[08:09:16] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: what should I use instead? Or how can I somehow show retrieved text back to hmtl for myOutput div?
[08:10:33] <VeetaPhone> if you're just retrieving text, then injecting it that way is fine... if you're retrieving json data, you'll need to convert it into markup first
[08:11:11] <VeetaPhone> you can either manually construct the markup from your data, or use something like handlebars and write a template to pass it through
[08:12:26] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: in this particular example, it's just text, but when I click on a outputResult I get no txt
[08:13:12] <VeetaPhone> let me take another look at the js
[08:13:37] <frojnd> the last url is more precise
[08:14:07] <VeetaPhone> you still haven't changed your dataType.. in this case, change it to 'html'
[08:14:48] <frojnd> ok, I did but no text is received from the url
[08:14:51] <VeetaPhone> also, you should wrap that whole thing in a document.ready super
[08:14:56] <VeetaPhone> wrapper*
[08:15:16] <VeetaPhone> is it actually making the ajax request?
[08:16:46] <frojnd> I see an error when running with developer tools from chromium
[08:17:07] <VeetaPhone> what error?
[08:17:32] <frojnd> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js%3E%3C/script%3E%20%20%20%20%3C!--%20%3Cscript%20src=
[08:17:48] <frojnd> src= 404 (Not Found)
[08:17:58] <frojnd> adn then line 7  like it won't load hello.js
[08:18:19] <VeetaPhone> looks like your cdn address is wrong for jQuery
[08:19:39] <frojnd> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js
[08:19:51] <frojnd> ^^ I thought this is the right .js for jquery
[08:21:26] <VeetaPhone> i'm just basing my guess off of what you posted
[08:22:13] <frojnd> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js <- I've added this and now I don't get an error
[08:23:26] <VeetaPhone> there we go... so can you verify on your network tab that the ajax request is made when you click the button?
[08:26:08] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: I'm not sure what should change. But whetn I click on a button I don't see anything in particular that changes in network tab
[08:28:21] <VeetaPhone> did you wrap your code in a document.ready function?
[08:28:36] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: what I don't understand is why I don't see hello.js under sources
[08:28:45] <VeetaPhone> it sounds like you may be binding that listener before the button is actually rendered
[08:31:17] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: when u say wrapa my code you mean I do it like this: $(document).ready(function() { $("#myButton").click(function() { }); }); ?
[08:32:33] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: like this? http://sprunge.us/hWDK
[08:33:01] <VeetaPhone> yep, any improvement?
[08:33:09] <frojnd> nope, still no text shown
[08:35:47] <BillCriswell> frojnd: What are you expecting to show up? You have returnText = "".
[08:36:21] <frojnd> BillCriswell: content of what get http://www.mocky.io/v2/5336d65a695d393f0757446a
[08:36:24] <frojnd> returns
[08:36:33] <VeetaPhone> i mean is it making the request in your network tab yet?
[08:36:42] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: nope
[08:36:54] <BillCriswell> frojnd: $("div#myOutput").html(data);
[08:37:05] <VeetaPhone> oh yeah, good catch bill
[08:39:30] <frojnd> hm still nothing, I tried to put javascript in html because I didn't see any hello.js in sources, and still nothing: http://sprunge.us/WFdW
[08:40:40] <BillCriswell> frojnd: Then that domain isn't allowing your script to access that page.
[08:41:18] <frojnd> hm
[08:41:54] <frojnd> it's local
[08:42:00] <frojnd> just file type
[08:43:42] <BillCriswell> frojnd: Look at the network tab and see what error you get.
[08:44:29] <frojnd> BillCriswell: no errors
[08:44:45] <BillCriswell> Do you see the request though?
[08:44:54] <frojnd> BillCriswell: I do see status for index.html and jquery.js
[08:45:28] <frojnd> BillCriswell: when I click on a button I don't see any changes
[08:45:43] <frojnd> BillCriswell: I see waiting, receiving
[08:45:49] <frojnd> when I hover timeline
[08:46:19] <VeetaPhone> in your sources tab, find your click event
[08:46:32] <VeetaPhone> and put a break point on the first line inside of it
[08:46:55] <VeetaPhone> then click the button and see if it's being triggered
[08:47:19] <frojnd> no
[08:47:24] <BillCriswell> I just tried it. "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.mocky.io/v2/5336d65a695d393f0757446a. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access"
[08:47:53] <frojnd> BillCriswell: what code are you using? http://sprunge.us/WFdW
[08:48:03] <frojnd> this one has javascript in it
[08:48:04] <BillCriswell> frojnd: Yours basically.
[08:48:16] <frojnd> I've updated index.html
[08:49:13] <VeetaPhone> frojnd: are you loading this from mocky.io?
[08:49:13] <BillCriswell> frojnd: That's not the issue.
[08:49:30] <frojnd> VeetaPhone: from my local machine
[08:49:32] <VeetaPhone> because if not, Google cross domain origin policy
[08:49:43] <BillCriswell> frojnd: http://jsbin.com/kebigami/1/edit look at the error in the console when you click "Click" here.
[08:50:29] <snufft> hi guys!
[08:50:43] <VeetaPhone> hola
[08:50:47] <snufft> is there a way to copy the classes from a child element, to its parent element?
[08:50:52] <snufft> hi VeetaPhone!
[08:52:13] <VeetaPhone> snufft, you could try $(this). parent().addClass($(this).attr('class'))
[08:52:27] <BillCriswell> frojnd: http://jsbin.com/kebigami/2/edit?js,output here is the same code with a url that allows cross domain requests.
[08:53:52] <frojnd> BillCriswell: first link you have, when I Click on a "click" nothing happens
[08:54:11] <BillCriswell> frojnd: I know, becuase that url doesn't allow cross domain requests.
[08:54:20] <BillCriswell> The second one does. That's why it works.
[08:54:49] <And1> Hello everyone! I tried to add $.ajax(url).fail to my script, which should load "/404.php", if the error 404 is given by the server. Though it seems I still forgot something. http://jsfiddle.net/TdHnp/3/
[08:54:56] <snufft> VeetaPhone, no dice unfortunately :( I've tried that and from the parent perspective as well and not had much luck
[08:55:03] <snufft> i'm just trying this in the console
[08:55:57] <VeetaPhone> snufft: if you console.log that class attr value, what does it show?
[08:55:58] <snufft> VeetaPhone, is this what you meant (with the selector)? jQuery('.hybridauth-icons li a').parent().addClass(jQuery(this).attr('class'));
[08:56:02] <BillCriswell> And1: console.log( response, status ) and make sure they're both what you think.
[08:56:09] <frojnd> BillCriswell: you are amazing :)
[08:56:18] <BillCriswell> Glad I could help!
[08:56:21] <frojnd> BillCriswell: thank you very much!!!!
[08:56:26] <BillCriswell> No problem at all!
[08:57:11] <zeph_> snufft, let me take a look
[08:57:18] <And1> BillCriswell: response seems not to be defined.
[08:57:20] <snufft> VeetaPhone, it comes up as undefined :|
[08:57:42] <snufft> zeph_, it's not live atm. going to try and make a fiddle now :)
[08:57:43] <zeph_> the problem is the way ur using 'this' in console
[08:57:44] <BillCriswell> And1: There you go.
[08:58:27] <And1> BillCriswell: So I maybe have to replace that with 'load'?
[08:59:03] <VeetaPhone> snufft: not quite, but zeph_ can probably get you the right syntax faster as I'm on a phone keypad :D
[09:00:02] <zeph_> snufft, here's an example of assigning class of first child of a body element to body
[09:00:07] <zeph_> $('body').addClass($($('body').children()[0]).attr('class'))
[09:00:09] <frojnd> BillCriswell: the second link you pasted this is json format?
[09:00:15] <BillCriswell> frojnd: Yes.
[09:00:34] <snufft> VeetaPhone, no. cheers!
[09:00:40] <snufft> zeph_, ahhh. i think i'm following you now :)
[09:00:44] <VeetaPhone> and1: i just checked the docs, and the status you're checking against isn't going to show you the code, just the word 'error' or something
[09:02:05] <VeetaPhone> snufft: you can also use .each on your original selector to give you a function you can get the proper scope in for using a reference to 'this'
[09:03:00] <VeetaPhone> like $(selector).each(function (){$(this).parent()....});
[09:03:17] <zeph_> yep
[09:03:56] <zeph_> hey, btw, I just built a conversion tool website -> native android/ios, looking for some feedback if anyone's interested (gonative.io)
[09:04:14] <VeetaPhone> looks like the wife's eye exam is done, that means I'm out... time to go stuck at Top Golf :D
[09:04:17] <zeph_> would love to hear your thoughts on it
[09:04:22] <VeetaPhone> suck*
[09:04:30] <And1> VeetaPhone, BillCriswell: It seems to work like this. Could you take a look, if you don't mind, if that's ok?
[09:04:51] <VeetaPhone> and1: Link?
[09:05:24] <BillCriswell> And1: If the done event fires it's not an error, so I'm not sure why you're testing that.
[09:05:29] <And1> http://jsfiddle.net/R6j2f/
[09:06:39] <BillCriswell> And1: if .fail() happens the status is an error, is .done() happens the status is success. The only time you should have to test that is if you're using always.
[09:06:41] <snufft> VeetaPhone, zeph_ each had it! :) updated it to this: http://jsfiddle.net/eNTwB/1/
[09:06:46] <snufft> thank you both for your help :D
[09:06:55] <snufft> is there karma on this channel/
[09:07:02] <VeetaPhone> no problem
[09:07:07] <VeetaPhone> nope
[09:07:10] <And1> Seems url is not right there, as it's unused.
[09:07:16] <VeetaPhone> so I'm looking at this gonative
[09:07:31] <And1> BillCriswell: Mh, so you're telling me, that I should not test for an error? Or did I misunderstand that?
[09:07:34] <VeetaPhone> is it just wrapping a site in phonegap or something? or what?
[09:08:02] <BillCriswell> And1: Not for errors like that.
[09:08:33] <And1> BillCriswell: But you understand, what I'm trying to do? What would be the right way then?
[09:10:48] <BillCriswell> And1: http://jsbin.com/kebigami/5/edit?js,output
[09:12:13] <VeetaPhone> also, i ran my own blog sure through that app generator, but the app crashes, just fyi
[09:12:43] <Horacsio> Hi guys. I would like to know where do set outerWidth when using includePadding with the perfect scrollbar: https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar
[09:13:10] <Horacsio> Iknow I have to set it true, but where do I insert the code?
[09:13:35] <VeetaPhone> ok i'm out!
[09:13:35] <frojnd> BillCriswell: I've updated my hello.js http://sprunge.us/DdcKand index.html but when I try to fetch and display data on local comuter I'm unable. Why might this be the case?
[09:13:55] <And1> BillCriswell: So if I don't use always, I should not test for fail or done?
[09:14:24] <BillCriswell> And1: Yes.
[09:14:43] <And1> BillCriswell: So could I maybe check for an error inside .done?
[09:14:58] <frojnd> BillCriswell: sry, this is http://sprunge.us/DdcK index.html http://sprunge.us/WFdW hello.js
[09:15:19] <frojnd> I don't understand why it won't show data locally
[09:15:24] <BillCriswell> And1: The status will always be "success" so checking for an error there would be pointless.
[09:15:28] <frojnd> and why I can't see hello.js under sources
[09:15:51] <And1> BillCriswell: I see. Then I'm out of ideas right now on how to check that the right way.
[09:16:30] <BillCriswell> frojnd: Browsers have security restrictions that won't allow a local file to access other local files ( without certain flags set at start up ).
[09:17:24] <BillCriswell> And1: .fail(function(){ /* Load 404 */ });, .done(function(response){ /* Work with response */ });
[09:19:26] <And1> BillCriswell: Oh, so I just can/should remove that inner-function if-test for an error/success?
[09:19:47] <BillCriswell> And1: Yes. The .done and .fail handle that for you.
[09:19:52] <Horacsio> hello?
[09:20:23] <And1> BillCriswell: Got it! Thanks. : )
[09:21:58] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[09:22:42] <m0dmd> hello everyone.
[09:22:44] <And1> BillCriswell: And instead of load('url') I maybe could also use html('<p>oops...sorry...error</p>'). Maybe that more elegant/flexible in this case.
[09:23:13] <BillCriswell> Yeah whichever you'd prefer.
[09:23:39] <And1> Hehe though I'm not sure about that, because the html-code would be over some lines.
[09:23:41] <zeph_> VeetaPhone no phonegap involved
[09:29:55] <m0dmd> Is it possible to add the datafiles.files object to an already created form so when the submit button is clicked, it posts the dataFiles.files along with all of the form data combined? I'm not interested in uploading anything via Ajax.
[09:30:08] <frojnd> BillCriswell: I tried on ff and chromium: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally and I still don't see any result when running that simple rest client :) it's like my javascript is ignored
[09:31:58] <BillCriswell> frojnd: I don't know.
[09:35:33] <frojnd> I'll just use inline script for the time being.
[09:37:25] <frojnd> BillCriswell: you sent a nice json uri. Let say I wanna grab some json data from "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds" like login and id and just show: Login name: "login_text_here" ID: "id_text" here. How would I do it?
[09:48:50] <BillCriswell> frojnd: response.propertyYouWant
[09:50:56] <BillCriswell> frojnd: http://jsbin.com/kebigami/8/edit?js,output small demo.
[10:01:39] <m0dmd> Would it be considered a hack, if I wanted to add the DataTransfer.files object to the form that is already on the page without transfering the files using Ajax?
[10:08:04] <m0dmd> Disregard, I know a quicker and better solution. ktnx
[11:17:07] <c0mrade_> WriteLn.Console("Hello");
[11:17:19] <c0mrade_> C:\System32> echo "What's up?"
[11:19:08] <c0mrade_> I have a script "bot.php" that is basically and IRC bot that connects to and IRC server via a socket.
[11:19:46] <c0mrade_> I've setup another socket server in that bot so that it could communicate with the webpage and I send it commands from there.
[11:20:06] <c0mrade_> So I want to have a webpage with buttons like "Join channel" "disconnect" "connect" etc...
[11:20:26] <c0mrade_> If I click the "JOIN" button the bot should join a channel.
[11:20:42] <c0mrade_> So how should it happen? Can it be done without using ajax?
[11:22:14] <systemfault> Just create php scripts for what you want to do… and just forms or ajax to call it.
[11:22:32] <c0mrade_> systemfault: Hehe. I didn't understand.
[11:23:24] <systemfault> Hmm… create a PHP script to join the channel and call it with ajax on the webpage?
[11:23:46] <c0mrade_> I have a php script that connects to IRC server.
[11:23:55] <c0mrade_> I want to send it commands from the webpage.
[11:24:02] <c0mrade_> Like I want to have multiple buttons.
[11:24:09] <c0mrade_> "JOIN" "PART"
[11:24:11] <c0mrade_> etc...
[11:24:25] <c0mrade_> If I click on JOIN the bot must join the channel.
[11:34:34] <And1> Clicking on a link in my navigation triggers $.ajax(url) to insert/load the content of the linked .php file into a div #include. That works superb, though I cannot use the back-button in the browser. Does anyone hast some advice for me on how to be able to use the back/forward buttons of my browser with that script?
[11:46:01] <r1k1> hello
[11:53:44] <Foxhoundz> can anyone recommend a syntax highlighting plugin?
[11:53:58] <Foxhoundz> It has to be one that can auto detect the language
[12:12:44] <frojnd> BinaryKitten: I'm looking at your small demo http://jsbin.com/kebigami/8/edit?js,output
[12:12:54] <frojnd> BinaryKitten: and I don't see any "json" declaration
[12:17:13] <BillCriswell> Foxhoundz: prism maybe?
[12:18:25] <BillCriswell> Foxhoundz: Not sure if it'll auto detect.
[12:19:30] <frojnd> eh, I meant BillCriswell
[12:19:33] <frojnd> ment*
[12:20:21] <frojnd> meant* was right :)
[12:20:59] <BillCriswell> frojnd: jQuery will figure it out based on the content type.
[12:22:30] <frojnd> neat
[12:44:45] <dmichaelis0> hello
[13:23:02] <And1> Hello! What could I do against this jslint warning? Unexpected 'in'. Compare with undefined, or use the hasOwnProperty method instead. -- if ("ontouchstart" in window) {
[13:37:12] <alaing> code?
[13:37:19] <alaing> And1: ^
[13:38:27] <And1> alaing: http://jsfiddle.net/e4VD9/ line 24
[13:39:18] <alaing> so you want to test ontouchstart?
[13:40:01] <raskel> hello, i have a client app on android which uses jquery to auth on a back-end app. is there a better way to keep my "auth status" on the client side so i don't have to make an ajax call on every page to "get" checkStatus.
[13:40:45] <alaing> raskel: session cookie?
[13:40:49] <And1> The code is (slightly modified) from here: http://themarklee.com/2013/12/26/simple-diy-responsive-slideshow-made-html5-css3-javascript/ – Yes, I want to test if using a touchscreendevice, I think, alaing.
[13:41:55] <And1> alaing: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/04/detecting-touch-its-the-why-not-the-how/ – mayber there is a better solution?
[13:43:31] <raskel> alaing, localStorage/html5 seems good for what i need.

[13:45:29] <And1> Huh. alaing, I meant. ^
[13:47:53] <arxwn> Hello: I want to add some css style to an elem. BUT for example {'background-image':' -moz-linear-gradient.... ; -webkit-gradient ....;  '} does not work. Can you help me?
[13:48:59] <alaing> And1: I think you might just get awa yusing .on
[13:49:15] <alaing> And1: I dont think you need to test for it
[13:50:02] <alaing> arxwn: I would suggest you stick your code into a class and use .addClass()
[13:50:30] <arxwn> Cannot do that because i change values via javascript
[13:50:50] <alaing> so then use .css()
[13:50:52] <And1> alaing: You mean $(window.on("ontouchstart") { ?
[13:52:00] <alaing> And1: i'm not use how your html is structure but just add an event listen i.e .on to it
[13:52:19] <alaing> so say you have a div #foo
[13:52:51] <alaing> $('#foo').on('touchstart','#gallery', function(){});
[13:52:56] <arxwn> The problem is I dont know how to do that: $('elem').css('text-shadow','-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px #000;-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px #000;box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px #000;'); //<= THAT dont work
[13:54:11] <alaing> And1: https://api.jquerymobile.com/swipeleft/ line 61
[13:54:25] <Uhkis> arxwn: http://api.jquery.com/css/
[13:55:47] <And1> alaing: Thanks!
[13:56:08] <alaing> and obviously a swiperight
[13:56:21] <alaing> no probs
[13:58:12] <arxwn> I dont think it can be done. I just need to break them down into multiple .css()
[14:03:21] <alaing> arxwn: what is you js setting the values too?
[14:03:56] <arxwn> I ended using something like this:
[14:04:19] <arxwn> .css('background-image':'-moz-linear-gradient(left, rgba(0,255,0,1) '+pos+'%, transparent '+pos+'%)','background-image':'-webkit-gradient(linear, left top, right top, color-stop('+pos+'%,rgba(0,255,0,1)), color-stop('+pos+'%,transparent))')
[14:04:36] <arxwn> you see that background-image
[14:04:42] <arxwn> is repeated twice
[14:04:54] <arxwn> and more if i add the other broswers prefixs
[14:05:23] <arxwn> thats bad it should be able to do it with in one css property and many values
[14:05:54] <alaing> so you just changing the background image position?
[14:06:00] <arxwn> yes
[14:06:12] <arxwn> but i need it for all browsers
[14:06:17] <arxwn> -webkit
[14:06:21] <arxwn> -o
[14:06:23] <arxwn> -ms
[14:06:26] <arxwn> -moz
[14:06:52] <alaing> cat you just use background-position?
[14:06:55] <alaing> cant
[14:07:06] <arxwn> No
[14:07:13] <alaing> so all the other stuff is in a css class
[14:07:14] <arxwn> Te problem is genewral
[14:07:15] <alaing> why?
[14:07:17] <arxwn> WE have
[14:07:29] <arxwn> 1 css property and many values
[14:07:36] <arxwn> 1 to M
[14:08:02] <arxwn> the solution is to use
[14:08:23] <arxwn> property1 = value1
[14:08:26] <arxwn> property1 = value2
[14:08:29] <arxwn> property1 = value3
[14:08:33] <arxwn> property1 = value4
[14:08:58] <arxwn> and NOT DRY like property1 = value1,value2,value3,value4
[14:13:27] <karangoel> hey guys? can i please get some help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22734465/jquery-mobile-ajax-request-redirects-back-on-error-how-to-prevent-it
[14:17:15] <sahbeewah> arxwn, having multiple css style keys for a rule is a trick in css to set the value in the dom to a particular value that is valid for the vendor. internally, there is only one value set for the particular style. you can't assign multiple values to a particular style key, and as such javascript will not allow you to do this.
[14:17:36] <sahbeewah> the solution you are looking for involves selecting the correct vendor prefix to assign to that particular style
[14:17:43] <sahbeewah> in jquery you can use: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.cssHooks/
[14:19:53] <kevincox> Hello, what backwards compatibility guarantees does jQuery provide relating to version numbers?  For example will any future 2.x.x release be backwards compatible with any previous 2.x.x release?

[14:22:45] <karangoel> anyone? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22734465/jquery-mobile-ajax-request-redirects-back-on-error-how-to-prevent-it ? i have never seen this behavior before, and it's diving me crazy. don't know what to do
[14:26:48] <CrowX-> I have a $(selector).show(300); call in my code. I notice that the animation starts slowly and speeds up as it goes. How can I change it, so that the speed would be constant during the animation?
[14:27:01] <CrowX-> also, how can I make it slow down as it goes?
[14:49:18] <alaing> CrowX-: do you have a demo?
[14:49:42] <alaing> you might be calling it multiple times and so it "doubles" up on itself
[14:50:54] <alaing> CrowX-: seen it before where a show/hide made the element continuously "bounce" because the animation was doubling up
[14:53:18] <dan_j> Hi. Is there a responsive charting plugin which resizes with the browser window? It will be used with the bootstrap library.
[14:53:29] <dan_j> Preferably animated on load too.
[14:54:49] <CrowX-> alaing, here's a demo http://jsfiddle.net/3aeJa/2/
[14:55:09] <CrowX-> also, as you can see, when you click an item of the menu, the 'minimize' function gets called twice
[14:55:45] <CrowX-> once by the click event, and once by the mouseleave event, since the click event causes the mouse to leave the element :)
[14:55:51] <CrowX-> any idea how I could work around that?
[14:57:58] <CrowX-> alaing, here's a changed version, with the needless html tags removed http://jsfiddle.net/3aeJa/3/
[14:58:11] <alaing> great thanks
[14:58:58] <jphase> dan_j: most charting libraries have a redraw method which you can call when the window is at a width that requires a redraw
[14:59:14] <jphase> highcharts.com is one I use often
[15:00:59] <dan_j> jphase: thanks for that. they look quite nice. Is it easy to resize them to the form? When you call re-draw, is there an option to skip the animation?
[15:01:33] <dan_j> jphase: ignore that. i can see from the demo that its what i'm looking for.
[15:01:34] <dan_j> Thank you
[15:01:38] <alaing> CrowX-: what "effect are you looking for?
[15:02:05] <jphase> dan_j: not sure if there's an option to skip the animation specifically on redraw/reflow but the chart object allows you to modify the settings after the chart is created.
[15:03:17] <alaing> CrowX-: are you looking for a "slide up" effect?
[15:03:44] <CrowX-> alaing, slide down on mouseenter and slide up on mouseleave
[15:03:50] <CrowX-> but that's not the main problem
[15:04:24] <alaing> i think is because you showing and hidding the row and the item in the wrong order
[15:04:46] <jphase> dan_j: oh sorry yeah, looks like they updated their libraries to automatically do that, I'll shutup now hehe
[15:04:55] <CrowX-> alaing, which should I load first?
[15:05:19] <dan_j> jphase: shame its not freeware/opensource :-(
[15:05:26] <dan_j> but still looking into it.
[15:05:34] <jphase> well it's fine if you keep their link in the bottom
[15:05:40] <jphase> if it's on an internal/admin page you can remove it
[15:05:59] <CrowX-> alaing, also, my biggest problem is this: I want minimize() to be called only once when clicking on a menu item, but it gets called twice (once by the click event, and once by the mouseleave event, which gets fired by the #menu element getting smaller and the mouse leaves it
[15:06:09] <CrowX-> any idea how I could prevent the second firing?
[15:11:56] <alaing> CrowX-:  sorry I need to call it a night
[15:12:02] <alaing> CrowX-: http://jsfiddle.net/3aeJa/5/
[15:12:26] <alaing> I used the "callback" of .show/hide to hide the other part
[15:12:37] <alaing> if i had time i would hvae written it again
[15:12:43] <CrowX-> ok thanks
[15:12:53] <alaing> its too over complicated for what it is you need
[15:13:08] <alaing> its slightly more smoother
[15:13:26] <alaing> but sorry i coudln't help any further
[15:28:06] <CrowX-> I solved it with using .not() :)
[15:41:41] <torbjorn> i have a div with several toggle buttons, and i have a $("#thatdiv").click set up to catch the clicks

[15:42:03] <torbjorn> aparently
[15:42:56] <torbjorn> is there a way to defer or do the click event after the button has been set toggled

[18:14:15] <williamtdr> Hi. Having a devil of a time to change what page the user is viewing using javascript on the latest version of jquery mobile.
[18:14:44] <williamtdr> I want to do this because after an ajax operation operation is conducted, if it's successful, I want to direct the user to a new page.
[18:15:10] <williamtdr> I've added an alert call, so I'm sure the code block is being called.
[18:15:26] <williamtdr> This is what I'm using to change the page right now, which has no effect: $.mobile.loadPage("#pg_home", { dataUrl: "#pg_home", transition: "none" });

[20:56:47] <kopasetik> what is a typical success function to insert inside a $.ajax() call?
[20:58:11] <jphase> kopasetik: whatever you want to happen after the ajax called has successfully completed
[20:59:55] <kopasetik> ok. it's often function(data){ something with data}, right?
[21:00:39] <jphase> yes
[21:01:21] <kopasetik> cool. thanks!
[21:09:56] <kopasetik> are there any big sites that are readily accessible by ajax calls? i've tried doing google and twitter and have been denied.
[21:10:09] <kopasetik> just want to practice.
[21:12:34] <jphase> kopasetik: you need a server that supports access origins from anywhere. often times it's easier to just write your own php script or something similar. when the domain you're accessing is different than the domain your ajax call is coming from it will throw an error because that server needs to be setup to accept CORS requests from any domain.
[21:15:51] <kopasetik> ok
[21:29:20] <jphase> kopasetik: here's a weather api you can toy with:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/6Ue66/
[21:42:31] <kopasetik> cool. thx!
[22:22:49] <gry> hi! how do I construct a link properly? $( '<a>' ).attr({href:'http://www.google.com', target: '_blank', data: 'hi'} ) is a link with empty innerhtml
[22:23:20] <systemfault> Just write the full html...
[22:23:47] <systemfault> $(‘<a href=“http://www.google.com” target=“_blank”>HI</a>’)
[22:24:01] <gry> what? tha'ts so prone to typos
[22:24:10] <systemfault> o_O
[22:24:56] <gry> i dont like remembering html when i write javascript
[22:25:21] <gry> html has a right to change, say, to [a href=|http://google.com| target=|blank|], with me not caring about it
[22:25:27] <gry> there's a legel of abstraction
[22:25:31] <gry> level even
[22:25:59] <aro> is there a way to apply a jquery function to an element $element after its been applied to the DOM
[22:26:06] <systemfault> You’re the guy talking about abstraction but yet you mix HTML with JS...
[22:26:41] <systemfault> aro: Just call the function? The fact that the node is in or out of the main DOM tree doesn’t mattter
[22:27:26] <aro> systemfault: $element = $('<div></div>'); $('body').append($element); [then perform operation on $element]
[22:27:28] <aro> like that
[22:27:38] <systemfault> You can
[22:27:39] <gry> woo $( '<a>' ).attr({href:'http://www.google.com', target: '_blank'} ).html('hi') worked
[22:28:03] <aro> systemfault: how?
[22:28:07] <gry> i just find it slightly more readable, dunno
[22:28:19] <systemfault> aro: Just call functions on $element
[22:28:28] <aro> will it replicate to the appended dom element?
[22:29:13] <systemfault> There’s no “replication”, a node is an object.. it can be attached to the main DOM tree or detached
[22:29:26] <systemfault> Calling functions on a node will work the way you think
[22:29:28] <aro> well i need to update an appended element
[22:29:39] <systemfault> $element is the appended node
[22:29:59] <aro> yes
[22:35:48] <aro> HOOAH
[22:35:53] <aro> thanks systemfault
[22:35:54] <aro> :)
