[01:15:47] <dunkel2> hello
[01:27:47] <dubkoidragon> hi, question. How can I make it so when someone clicks anywhere in the div it will take them to a different page
[01:29:09] <dubkoidragon> what i mean is i havea  div with a background image as a button(not really but you knwo what i mean), and if anyone clicks on that div I want it to take them to the relative page
[01:29:55] <dubkoidragon> should i change the div into an <a> in the click function?
[01:29:58] <dubkoidragon> i dunno
[01:50:51] <sash_> dubkoidragon: You don't need an a, you can do someting like $(".mydiv").click(function() { window.location = "/whereever"; });
[01:57:58] <dubkoidragon> sash_: ok can that location be a file, or a url??
[02:10:31] <sash_> dubkoidragon: A URl, usually.
[02:21:59] <pi-> <button id="uploadButton" onclick="uploadClick()" type="button" disabled>Upload</button>
[02:22:26] <pi-> function recordClick() { $('#uploadButton').disabled = false; ... }
[02:22:52] <pi-> Why is this code failing to enable the button?
[02:23:12] <pi-> Single stepping shows it executes.
[02:24:31] <Cronon> $("#upploadButton").prop('diasbled',false)
[02:25:20] <Cronon> you are trying to write into unexistent property of jquery object
[02:30:10] <pi-> tx Cronon
[02:59:48] <daslicht> hello, how would the following plain js be implented using jQuery please: http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/pdbLoosn/
[03:03:51] <ozd> daslicht why would you want to implement some pure javascript with jquery? what is your gain?
[03:04:13] <hd1> ozd: an A on as assignment? :)
[03:05:09] <ozd> hd1: aaaand do we help people who want fish to give to his teacher?
[03:05:32] <daslicht> I just like to understand how things work
[03:05:39] <daslicht> there is no practical use in this example
[03:05:46] <daslicht> do you know how ?
[03:07:21] <daslicht> I tried something like this :
[03:07:21] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/pdbLoosn/
[03:07:30] <daslicht> but that seams to be the wrong way :)
[03:08:16] <Cronon> $('#mytemplate .foo').html()
[03:08:20] <ozd> $('#mytemplate.foo').html();
[03:08:52] <ozd> do you want to print `hello world` inside div with id `result`
[03:09:11] <daslicht> i just like to get the content of foo
[03:09:24] <daslicht> like this t.content.querySelector('.foo').innerHTML;
[03:09:30] <daslicht> but using jQuery
[03:10:19] <ozd> ok there it is, check above
[03:11:04] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/jdpfy9mg/1/
[03:11:07] <daslicht> that does not work
[03:11:39] <Cronon> you missed a space
[03:12:20] <daslicht> the space doesnt matter
[03:12:33] <daslicht> anyways it downt work like this even with space
[03:17:22] <Cronon> is jquery3 mandatory?
[03:17:44] <Cronon> all works in second version
[03:20:20] <sash_> I have some problems with the template thing. When I change it do divs, everything works fine
[03:27:10] <ozd> ok templates work a little bit differently i think
[03:27:12] <ozd> that works now
[03:27:24] <ozd> http://jsfiddle.net/tnj3mhhf/
[03:27:50] <daslicht> Cronon: even with v2 its undefined: http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/qo19esbL/1/
[03:28:25] <daslicht> ozd: http://jsfiddle.net/tnj3mhhf/ still undefined in your example
[03:28:56] <ozd> daslicht what is your browser?
[03:29:01] <daslicht> safari
[03:29:08] <daslicht> let me try in firefox
[03:29:10] <ozd> mine is firefox
[03:29:22] <ozd> templates are quite new so there may be some issues with compatibility
[03:30:17] <daslicht> ok check, using vanilla js for templates is a better solution
[03:31:01] <daslicht> thank you for you time
[03:31:48] <ozd> np
[03:32:41] <daslicht> :D
[03:58:04] <dubkoidragon> sash_: Ok so will that one open it in a new tab or window, and how can i get it to open in the same window
[04:11:51] <dubkoidragon> hey question, if I have a div that's right and left margins are 300px, what is that div's width? Like how can i figure that out so its generic and works on any size monitor? If an explenation of why I am asking this will help I'll provide it.
[04:37:28] <sash_> dubkoidragon: $("#yourdiv").outerWidth(true)
[04:38:20] <sash_> dubkoidragon: Your other question is answered here: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_open.asp
[05:40:15] <jaggzt> https://jsfiddle.net/9ta0q3db/2/  Why does height(x) override hide()?    I am animating the height down to 0 tall, then hiding it, but restoring its height for the future
[06:15:56] <jaggzt> https://jsfiddle.net/9ta0q3db/14/  immediately after .animate(), and prior to the "complete" function callback, my object reappears
[06:16:21] <jaggzt> I animate its height down to 0, and it snaps visible again.. maybe some overflow thing?
[06:18:11] <jop008> I like this theme http://driftyco.github.io/graphite/ how to set this up with 1.4.5?
[06:18:31] <jop008> I used theme roller but I can not create it

[08:33:40] <knn> I clear the cookies run application again. same....
[08:33:45] <knn> I dont have 1.6.4
[08:33:52] <knn> I have 2.1.4
[08:33:56] <knn> why this is happening ?
[08:34:08] <daslicht> looks like there is another iport somewhere
[08:34:12] <daslicht> import
[08:37:12] <knn> I dont see another import.
[08:37:22] <knn> Actually i dont see anything in resources
[08:37:33] <daslicht> look at the souce code
[08:37:39] <daslicht> of your app
[08:37:44] <daslicht> not in the browser
[08:37:46] <daslicht> :)
[08:37:58] <knn> I looked both.
[08:38:20] <daslicht> what is that project ?
[08:38:26] <daslicht> a cms ? a custom built app ?
[08:38:40] <daslicht> is it online ?
[08:38:46] <knn> a custom built app with asp.net mvc templte
[08:38:53] <knn> asp.net mvc 5 template
[08:39:49] <daslicht> ok
[08:39:55] <daslicht> i have no expericne with ask stuff
[08:40:12] <daslicht> first google hit on "how to add jquery asp..." i got :
[08:40:12] <daslicht> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20081328/how-to-add-jqueryui-library-in-mvc-5-project
[08:40:43] <daslicht> IU would try to understand how you add js to asp projects and inspect the code where it's being imported
[08:40:52] <daslicht> I am going out now having a cold beer
[08:40:55] <daslicht> cya later :D
[08:40:55] <knn> it is automatically added.. i am trying to implement http://miohtama.github.io/Eric-Cartman/
[08:41:26] <daslicht> yeah , that automitic stuff needs to be understood
[08:41:35] <daslicht> probably its the wrong channnel here
[08:41:45] <daslicht> I would try to find a asp channel ? maybe
[08:41:53] <daslicht> there is the chance bigger as in here :)
[08:42:19] <knn> I think it is chrome situation
[08:48:40] <aayush_> hii all
[08:51:00] <aayush_>  I am really keen towards jquery features and applications and want to contribute
[09:02:53] <daslicht> @knn: i bet no

[11:17:55] <wroathe> Is there a special name for a tree data structure where nodes are the roots of other trees?

[11:27:10] <Giraffe_> hi, so i have an input field (for searching a jstree). I'm using val() to insert highlighted text into the input field (which works). Now, I need to submit the field so the search function is fired. I've tried using .submit(),       e = jQuery.Event(key... ) and then trigger(e);
[11:27:13] <Giraffe_> any ideas on what else i could do?
[11:28:41] <Giraffe_> nvm, seems like a focus() did the trick
[12:15:58] <javawolfpack> Is it possible to nest ajax calls to replace the same content? https://jsfiddle.net/we3sxes6/
[12:16:28] <javawolfpack> Code currently replaces the first response but not the second… I am getting the alert.
[12:21:23] <mission712> Hello!
[12:23:11] <mission712> Anyone not afk?
[12:26:31] <mission712> Alright then
[12:27:11] <javawolfpack> I’m not, what’s up?

[15:20:48] <Zeranoe> Does jquery provide any way to sort the values in a table?
[15:24:53] <arc_> considering how many plugins a google search returns, i'm going to say no
[15:25:13] <arc_> you would have to either do it manually or use a plugin
[15:25:14] <Zeranoe> arc_: A built in way
[15:25:15] <arc_> i recommend using a plugin
[15:32:27] <Whirled> what are you trying to do?
[15:32:45] <Whirled> Jquery is just javascript. You can sort using JS
[15:33:22] <Zeranoe> im trying to sort the contents of a table
[15:33:47] <Zeranoe> Wikipedia does it somehow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software
[15:33:59] <arc_> lol
[15:34:06] <arc_> it's certainly not impossible
[15:34:15] <Whirled> There are lots of table plugins that use jquery. Id use a plugin for that as well.
[15:34:22] <Zeranoe> I know. I'm trying to see how they do it
[20:53:55] <esaym153> is this legal jquery: $.each($('form'), function(i) {}); ? all the examples I see use an array of objects or something, not an actually jquery element
