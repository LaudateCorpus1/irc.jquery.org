[00:08:55] <raj> olly olly oxen free
[00:42:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone around  need some help
[00:42:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> with a togle switch
[00:43:35] <raj> what's up?
[00:44:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/4LDn7/
[00:44:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> so im creating a toggle switch
[00:44:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> exactly or as close to the ios7 switch
[00:44:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> its touch based (im using the chrome touch emulator for testing)
[00:45:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> it reacts fine to tap and swiping
[00:45:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i want to get one more thing working
[00:45:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> which is gettingt he proerties such as pageX
[00:45:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> that you can access with touches[0]
[00:45:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> unfortunately i cant get these
[00:45:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> it says its undefined
[00:45:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: anyideas
[00:45:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[00:46:00] <raj> I'm not really familiar with touch
[00:46:13] <raj> how do I emulate it?
[00:46:39] <raj> for chrome
[00:46:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> open devloper tools
[00:47:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> and press
[00:47:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> [esc]
[00:47:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> in the elements view
[00:47:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> and you can emulate devices and turn on emulate touch
[00:47:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: find it?
[00:47:57] <raj> escape  brings up the console
[00:49:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then there should be emulation tab
[00:49:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: what version of chrome
[00:51:15] <raj> 31.stuff
[00:51:45] <raj> Elements tab doesn't have an Emulation tab
[00:52:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> got o elements and hit [esc]
[00:52:19] <raj> nope
[00:52:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> if on 31 also try the gear icon in bottom right corner when devloper tools is open
[00:52:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> chrome 32 moved it
[00:52:40] <raj> maybe you have a plugin
[00:52:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> nope
[00:52:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> its native to chrome
[00:52:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> try gear icon in corner
[00:53:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then there should be something like emulation or something
[00:53:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/mobile-emulation
[00:53:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^that should work
[00:54:40] <raj> you spelled `original` wrong
[00:54:43] <raj> line 4
[00:55:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> shit
[00:56:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> hodl up
[00:56:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold let me see if fixed
[00:56:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: thanks bro it works
[00:56:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/4LDn7/1/
[00:56:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> got what i wanted
[00:58:16] <ribot> hi
[00:59:50] <ribot> i'm prepending dynamic content, and when i do it a second time it doesn't work as expected... suppose i want the order of elements a,b,c, then $(c).prepend(a); $(c).prepend(b); produces the order b,a,c
[01:04:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> ribot: create a fiddle so i can take a look
[01:06:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> ribot: maybe use append?
[01:06:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then srot somehow
[01:06:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> sort
[01:22:01] <Tingle> im trying to manualy trigger a file input by using .trigger('click'). but I get a js error saying too much recursion and nothing happens. how can I trigger that?
[01:24:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> Tingle: a jsfiddle possible
[01:24:44] <Tingle> fixed it :P
[01:24:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[01:24:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> see thats how magical #jquery is
[01:25:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> Tingle: you ask and #jquery solves
[01:25:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[01:36:40] <Tingle> what is the selector to get the parent of a element, im trying '#user-image-select :parent' but that isnt working
[01:51:21] <sasmit87> Hi all
[01:51:49] <sasmit87> I HAVE THE HTML LIKE THIS
[01:51:53] <sasmit87> <input type="text" title="Please specify your hobbies and interests" data-toggle="tooltip" placeholder="" name="hobbies2" value="" id="hobbies2" class="form-control input-sm">
[01:52:10] <sasmit87> sorry
[01:52:18] <sasmit87> <input type="text" title="Please specify your hobbies and interests" data-toggle="tooltip" placeholder="" name="hobbies2" value="abcd" id="hobbies2" class="form-control input-sm">
[01:53:09] <sasmit87> when I am doing $("#hobbies2").val('');   -> its not making the value as blank
[01:53:48] <sasmit87> however when I am doing $("#hobbies2").attr(value,"");  -> working perfectly
[01:54:01] <sasmit87> why so??
[01:55:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: welcome back bro
[01:55:58] <sasmit87> Hey Hi
[01:56:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> `api parent Tingle
[01:56:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: mind putting tha code in a fiddle if possible
[01:56:27] <sasmit87> you got my query
[01:56:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> im reading
[01:56:40] <sasmit87> ok
[01:56:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: jquery mobile i presume?
[01:57:05] <sasmit87> no
[01:57:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay make a fiddle ill see
[02:00:57] <sasmit87> http://jsfiddle.net/3PVrM/
[02:02:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: looking now
[02:02:31] <Tingle> ok so I have something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/5EPr9/ and click gets triggered twice, the .click() I do on the child triggers the click event I boung on #user-image-select, I take it because the event is bubbling up through the parent. Is there a way I can make this only trigger once? Ive tried adding stopPropagation() in there, but that didnt help.
[02:02:50] <sasmit87> Rohan_Bhangui: okay
[02:03:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> event.preventDefault()
[02:03:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> Tingle: but realistically stopPropogation should work
[02:05:08] <Tingle> like this http://jsfiddle.net/5EPr9/1/?
[02:05:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: it works http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/3PVrM/1/
[02:05:27] <Tingle> click still pops up twice in the console
[02:05:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: i mean http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/3PVrM/2/
[02:05:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> Tingle: looking
[02:06:46] <Tingle> sec, think I know what I have to do
[02:06:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> Tingle: why do you need to trigger click twice?
[02:06:59] <sasmit87> Rohan_Bhangui: what you did??
[02:07:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> nothing
[02:07:05] <Tingle> I dont, I only want to trigger it once
[02:07:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait a sec
[02:07:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> what version of jquery?
[02:07:15] <sasmit87> then how it worked for u
[02:07:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> im using 1.x
[02:07:33] <Tingle> there we go, fixed it
[02:07:44] <Tingle> http://jsfiddle.net/5EPr9/3/
[02:07:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> Tingle: show me fiddle (im curious :P)
[02:07:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks
[02:08:05] <Tingle> now click only shows up once
[02:08:07] <sasmit87> what was wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/3PVrM/
[02:08:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: first jquery isnt loaded
[02:08:48] <sasmit87> ohh
[02:08:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[02:08:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> gg
[02:09:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: dw even after working with jquery for a while i too forget
[02:09:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> alright off to sleep
[02:09:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> cya in a few hours
[02:11:06] <sasmit87> what about this http://jsfiddle.net/3PVrM/3/
[02:17:29] <mikunos1> sasmit87: http://jsfiddle.net/3PVrM/5/
[02:18:05] <sasmit87> I want to do that in pure javascript
[02:18:08] <sasmit87> no jquery

[02:20:44] <mikunos1> hi guys how have I to abstract this object? http://jsfiddle.net/M3C9b/1/
[02:21:09] <mikunos1> I need to use the same function for all the select object
[02:21:16] <mikunos1> in a page
[02:21:59] <mikunos1> all the information like url, fields, etc .. have to be in the object attribute
[02:26:38] <mikunos1> is there a way to call item.customer_id from a object variable using the name like item[MYVAR] ?
[02:28:32] <mikunos1> any help?
[02:31:24] <bigbugjava> Hi, Having issues applying Object into datatable, getting in side that table Object Object , and not the content it self, any reason why?
[02:44:10] <JBreit> anyone have any idea how to prevent the popup from disappearing when the submit button is fired on the form?  I have it to where the form is removed but need to display a message afterwards. http://innermindco.com/editional/wtf/diamond.html
[02:46:48] <bigbugjava> JBreit, nice design, whats the issue?
[02:47:22] <JBreit> okay when I submit the form it removes the form and if you pay attention there is a gray div that shows but then it dissappears
[02:47:38] <bigbugjava> JBreit check out form preventdefalut on submit
[02:47:38] <phizes> https://www.fnb.co.za/02javascript/chameleon/chameleon.js?v=1.07 <- line 87, major bank website in South Africa -_-
[02:47:51] <JBreit> I need to figure out how to get that popup to stay on screen so I can put a message in the gray div
[02:48:08] <bigbugjava> you'll get all your answers for it
[02:48:29] <bigbugjava> sending you code, sec
[02:48:39] <JBreit> k
[02:48:57] <JBreit> this css3 diamond form was kind of fun to make for the site it is going into but a pain in the ass
[02:49:23] <bigbugjava>     $("#myForm").submit(function(e) {e.preventDefault();});
[02:50:04] <bigbugjava> I hope you understand where to put your code here, it simply prevent the default act of form, and let you do whatever you want.
[02:50:11] <JBreit> ya
[02:50:54] <JBreit> though it worked also with event.preventDefault();going on the line following the .submit() without the funtion(e) too
[02:51:10] <JBreit> that is a bit cleaner though and less typing
[02:51:23] <bigbugjava> give it a try. tell me how it goes
[02:51:33] <JBreit> works great
[02:51:43] <JBreit> I was thinking I might need to do something like that
[02:51:49] <JBreit> slowly grasping jQuery
[02:51:52] <bigbugjava> ;)
[02:51:56] <bigbugjava> me 2 actualy
[02:51:59] <bigbugjava> actually
[02:52:42] <JBreit> the header for the site I am working on this for is the first real JS/jQuery thing I ever wrote and used without a plugin besides some dialog boxes and accordions
[02:53:03] <ph88> hi mikunos1
[02:53:10] <Tingle> I just cant get IE9 to not stop my submit, im doing all this: http://hastebin.com/miniluhofu.avrasm but the event submit on my form still goes through and opens up the target - none of my ajax submit forms work because of this
[02:53:21] <mikunos1> hi ph88
[02:53:35] <ph88> mikunos1: put that {} stuff in a variable
[02:53:44] <mikunos1> ??
[02:53:49] <JBreit> I probably should figure out some kind of graceful degredation for the form due to it messing up in IE
[02:54:00] <JBreit> everything messes up in IE though
[02:54:01] <mikunos1> ph88 how?
[02:54:02] <JBreit> :P
[02:54:16] <ph88> mikunos1:   $("#customer_id").select2({ 		minimumInputLength: 3,  etc..   -->              var stuff = { 		minimumInputLength: 3,  etc..          $("#customer_id").select2(stuff);
[02:54:33] <mikunos1> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20161357/select2-in-a-complex-form-as-abstract-class
[02:54:40] <mikunos1> ph88 ^^
[02:54:58] <ph88> screen shot is small
[02:55:07] <mikunos1> ph88 click on it
[02:55:26] <ph88> doesn't work click
[02:55:32] <mikunos1> http://i.stack.imgur.com/jVILq.jpg
[02:56:41] <mikunos1> I really don't understood what you suggest me
[02:56:46] <ph88> so all select2 need the exact same initialization object ?
[02:56:59] <mikunos1> ph88 unfortunatelly not
[02:57:10] <ph88> can you point out the differences ?
[02:57:26] <mikunos1> ph88 the fields [id, text] and endpoint are different
[02:57:45] <mikunos1> callback-url="/admin/customers/search/" fields-data="lastname,firstname,company" field-id="customer_id"
[02:57:57] <mikunos1> I have ^^ added these input attributes
[02:58:04] <mikunos1> in the hidden field
[02:58:12] <mikunos1> in order to customze them
[02:58:42] <mikunos1> but I am finding some problem to abstract the function for all the select
[02:59:36] <ph88> so in the input box you have   callback-url    and what about   ields [id, text] and endpoint  ??
[02:59:40] <ph88> fields*
[03:01:07] <mikunos1> endpoint = callback-url
[03:01:14] <mikunos1> is the same thing
[03:01:34] <ph88> what about text ?
[03:01:46] <ph88> oh the return value
[03:01:55] <ph88> ok so only endpoint is different ?
[03:02:45] <mikunos1> http://jsfiddle.net/M3C9b/2/
[03:03:25] <mikunos1> When you call a select2 object you need the values in the select [id, text] and the endpoint or callback or URL
[03:03:48] <mikunos1> what I am trying to achieve is a way to abstract the request
[03:04:09] <mikunos1> delegating three parameters to the input attribute
[03:04:23] <ph88> can you do a factory pattern ?
[03:04:42] <mikunos1> like: [field-id, field-data, callback-url]
[03:05:03] <mikunos1> what do u mean with factory pattern?
[03:07:13] <ph88> btw do you know about jQuery.data() ?
[03:07:26] <ph88> if you have html attribute like data-text you can get it with .data('text')
[03:08:21] <mikunos1> ph88 yes I know it
[03:09:24] <ph88> what does cache: true  do ?
[03:15:47] <becom33> after conflicking a new version jquery on my page when I use the the variable on plugin  I get a no method error . but if I use the old $ I get .on method cannot found error
[03:15:57] <becom33> not sure what am I doing wrong
[03:16:01] * becom33 help ?
[03:16:41] <svetlana> Show code?
[03:17:53] <becom33> huge code
[03:18:07] <becom33> hmm lemme reduce a little & do a paste
[03:21:02] <ph88> some code is not compatible with newer jQuery
[03:24:12] <becom33> svetlana, http://pastebin.com/7Ecb5LKz
[03:24:46] <svetlana> Please address to entire channel, not mjust me.
[03:25:12] <becom33> if I change the $j_10 to $ if gives me .on method cannot be found error
[03:26:48] <ph88> hows it going mikunos1  ?
[03:27:01] <svetlana> Acknowledged; someone would be with you soon. If you see an error and it mentions line number, it's a useful bit to include.
[03:27:23] <mikunos1> ph88 I am trying to test the .data() without any success
[03:27:49] <ph88> mikunos1: it's just a little handy ... not really related to your original problem. Did the comment on stackoverflow helped ?
[03:28:40] <becom33> Im getting "Object [object Object] has no method 'on' " when I use $ for the timepicker & when I use $j_10 Im getting " Object [object Object] has no method 'timepicker' "
[03:29:10] <mikunos1> ph88 let me see
[03:33:06] <ravenzz> becom33 http://jsfiddle.net/LB4Ff/
[03:33:36] <ravenzz> read more about noConflict here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[03:35:06] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/LB4Ff/1/
[03:35:18] <mikunos1> ph88 nothing to do
[03:35:44] <mikunos1> ph88 I am testing it and the function doesn't get the callback-url
[03:36:05] <mikunos1> ph88 the hidden input has the attribute with the correct value
[03:36:15] <becom33> did I do something wrong in my script ?
[03:36:45] <mikunos1> becom33 are u talking with me?
[03:36:56] <becom33> sorry no ravenzz
[03:37:22] <mikunos1> ph88 select2.attr("callback-url")
[03:37:31] <ph88> mikunos1: ye
[03:37:33] <mikunos1> has not any valus
[03:37:58] <ph88> before  return   do console.log(select2, select2.attr("callback-url"))
[03:39:00] <ravenzz> you should include the new library after the old one the assign to $j_10 with noConflict
[03:39:42] <ravenzz> here is explained how noConflict works https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L205
[03:41:10] <mikunos1> solved
[03:41:17] <becom33> thanks that worked . ravenzz
[03:41:18] <becom33> :D
[03:42:11] <ravenzz> yea but please read the docs
[03:45:56] <mikunos1> ph88 the field-id and the field-data are not read
[03:46:53] <ph88> mikunos1: how did you solve it ?
[03:49:04] <mikunos1> wrong attribute name ph88
[03:49:39] <mikunos1> now seems that it grab all the information from the callbacks
[03:52:22] <mikunos1> ph88 just another question: is there a way to create a placeholder for the fields-data?
[03:53:05] <mikunos1> ph88 I mean I would like to show 3 fields like: John Doe - Company Ltd.
[03:53:47] <mikunos1> in the fields-data I would like to write: firstname lastname - company
[03:54:07] <mikunos1> and the jQuery transform it in John Doe - Company Ltd.
[03:54:24] <mikunos1> is it possible ph88?
[03:55:43] <ph88> mikunos1: what do you mean wrong attribute name ?? i copy exactly what you had
[03:56:08] <mikunos1> I have changed the name
[03:56:20] <ph88> mikunos1: can you except the answer ???
[03:56:22] <mikunos1> and I have not updated the code, my fault
[03:57:00] <ph88> this was a good pattern which i wrong i think ^^
[03:57:06] <ph88> wrong -> wrote
[03:57:18] <mikunos1> yes of course
[03:57:27] <mikunos1> have you read above?
[03:59:43] <ph88> yes you can format, there are example on the select2 page
[03:59:53] <ph88> but plz click accept answer on stackoverflow -____-
[04:00:13] <mikunos1> ph88 already done
[04:00:15] <mikunos1> :D
[04:00:44] <ph88> thxx :)
[04:01:16] <mikunos1> can you help me to add the format?
[04:01:24] <mikunos1> ph88 ^
[04:01:50] <ph88> formatResult: movieFormatResult, // omitted for brevity, see the source of this page
[04:01:55] <ph88> formatSelection: movieFormatSelection,  // omitted for brevity, see the source of this page
[04:01:57] <ph88> search for that
[04:02:04] <mikunos1> no it is not correct
[04:02:09] <mikunos1> re-read my question
[04:02:18] <mikunos1> read again
[04:02:56] <mikunos1> select2.attr("fields-data") will be "firstname lastname - company"
[04:03:01] <ph88> oh like a mask
[04:03:21] <mikunos1> so the item[fieldname] is not correct
[04:03:33] <mikunos1> and I am tthinking a way to use that way
[04:03:45] <ph88> what's item[fieldname]  ?
[04:04:02] <mikunos1> item is the result of the query. It is an array
[04:04:19] <mikunos1> fieldname is the fields list
[04:04:37] <ph88> why is that not correct ?
[04:04:37] <mikunos1> if I try to set the input hidden object with
[04:04:56] <mikunos1> because fields-data will be "firstname lastname - company"
[04:05:03] <mikunos1> so item["firstname lastname - company"]
[04:05:06] <mikunos1> is wrong
[04:06:29] <ph88> item['firstname'] + ' ' + item['lastname'] + ' - ' + item['company']
[04:07:45] <mikunos1> ph88 right but how to do it automatically ?
[04:08:17] <mikunos1> ph88 this is an abstract class
[04:08:35] <mikunos1> so you have to imagine to use it in all the select object
[04:08:36] <ph88> javascript doesn't have classes
[04:08:48] <mikunos1> ph88 you have understood
[04:08:49] <mikunos1> :D
[04:09:07] <ph88> Factory !!!
[04:09:30] <mikunos1> show me an example please
[04:09:42] <ph88> of what ? your programming challange ?
[04:16:06] <ph88> mikunos1: still here ?

[05:39:17] <mikunos1> ph88 look at http://jsfiddle.net/GcJgU/4/
[05:39:58] <mikunos1> as you can see the problem persists
[05:40:44] <mikunos1> within the object select2 I cannot use  $(this).attr("url-search") + "/term/",
[05:41:00] <mikunos1> seems that the $(this) is not recognized
[05:41:06] <felixjet> im using iCheck to replace checkboxes with a jquery plugin, but i cant manage to align vertically the label and the input
[05:41:11] <felixjet> could someone help me?
[05:41:22] <felixjet> im asking if i can ask, because its css related, even if its a jquery plugin
[05:45:48] <kpl> Currently jQuery UI does not include styling of traditional check/radio-buttons (although I understand that there are plans to support this, like mobile does). I need some larger check boxes, that appear the same on different browsers, and preferably which are compatible with jQuery UI themes. Any plugin suggestions?
[05:59:00] <lintguy> Is it possible to do something when a non-jquery function is executed?
[05:59:33] <duckgoose> I don't know what you mean
[06:00:52] <lintguy> The page already have a function that is executed, i want to do something additional with jquery when that function is executed and i don't have access to the sourcecode of that function so i can't add it manually.
[06:01:24] <lintguy> afaik i can only re-declare the function, thus rewriting it's current functionality'
[06:02:25] <jobney> lintguy: well.. it is javascript.. so you can monkeypatch it.. if your into that kind of thing
[06:02:37] <[sola]> $('#MYDIVID').nextAll('table')[3] is this code valid ?
[06:02:38] <duckgoose> re-declaring the function seems like a good idea to me. I don't understand what the problem is with that
[06:02:48] <[sola]> i'm trying to get 4 table in a div
[06:04:16] <lintguy> duckgoose: The problem is that if the app is updated, the code breaks
[06:04:30] <lintguy> jobney: monkeypatch?
[06:08:23] <duckgoose> bah
[06:08:36] <duckgoose> [sola] see http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[06:08:53] <jobney> lintguy: http://jsfiddle.net/justinobney/fGagB/1/
[06:10:00] <lintguy> jobney: That is exactly what i was looking for! THANKS!
[06:10:17] <[sola]> jobney: i'm readiing now. thank you
[06:10:38] <lintguy> jobney: And i love the styling
[06:11:47] <jobney> yea.. bootstrap exists for people like myself
[06:16:17] <[sola]> jobney: can you give me a hand about jquery.
[06:16:32] <jobney> what's the issue?
[06:16:51] <[sola]> i'm trying to get tables by index in a div .
[06:17:02] <[sola]> but i can't figure out how.
[06:17:46] <[sola]> <div id="anydiv"><table1></table><table2></table>......<tablen></tablen>
[06:17:56] <[sola]> first step i want to reach 1'st table
[06:18:00] <[sola]> and then second table
[06:18:08] <[sola]> and then 3rd table etc.
[06:18:15] <Velveeta> are you wanting to iterate over all of them?
[06:18:24] <duckgoose> .___.
[06:18:35] <duckgoose> [sola] did you look at what I sent you?
[06:18:44] <duckgoose> http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[06:18:44] <[sola]> Velveeta: no.
[06:18:52] <Velveeta> also, lintguy, if you're still around, you can decorate that function to do some extra stuff, without having to copy/paste the guts of the function itself
[06:18:54] <[sola]> i'm trying to get data from that table contains
[06:19:01] <jobney> [sola]: make a jsfiddle with a test case
[06:19:17] <[sola]> http://dtvt.basbakanlik.gov.tr/AnaSayfa.aspx
[06:19:22] <[sola]> here is my goverment website
[06:19:29] <Velveeta> i don't mean iterate over its rows, i mean iterate over the tables themselves.. all of them, or only selected ones?
[06:19:35] <[sola]> and my job build a directory
[06:19:47] <[sola]> i want to capture treepanel
[06:20:01] <[sola]> i'm scrapping website via casperjs.
[06:20:17] <[sola]> and phantomjs included ( remotely jquery)
[06:20:34] <[sola]> but i don't know how to
[06:20:39] <[sola]> access tables.
[06:20:41] <[sola]> orderly
[06:20:56] <Velveeta> are the tables the only children of that div?
[06:21:05] <[sola]> yes
[06:21:19] <Velveeta> then you can just do $('#yourDiv').children().each(function(){})
[06:21:21] <[sola]> orginal div id #ContentPlaceHolder1_Kurumlar
[06:21:37] <[sola]> but tables increasing or decreasing dynamically
[06:21:48] <Velveeta> i don't know what that means
[06:21:52] <Velveeta> nested?
[06:22:10] <[sola]> [ in the  link left tree panel ]  http://dtvt.basbakanlik.gov.tr/AnaSayfa.aspx
[06:22:11] <[sola]> yes
[06:22:26] <Velveeta> then use a .find instead of .children, it'll get all of them
[06:22:39] <Velveeta> $('#ContentPlaceHolder1_Kurumlar').find('table').each()
[06:22:44] <[sola]> var k =$('#ContentPlaceHolder1_Kurumlar').nextAll('table');
[06:22:55] <[sola]> this also gets all tables.
[06:23:05] <Velveeta> if your dive is that id, then nextAll won't work
[06:23:08] <Velveeta> div*
[06:23:12] <lintguy> What does "Refused to set unsafe header "Connection" mean?
[06:23:34] <Velveeta> lintguy: sounds like your browser rejected you setting a header due to some security restrictions
[06:23:36] <[sola]> why ?
[06:24:02] <[sola]> if your dive  is that id, then nextAll won't work
[06:24:10] <Velveeta> [sola]: because next and nextAll operate on siblings, not children
[06:24:23] <Velveeta> so if your div contains those tables, they're children, not siblings
[06:25:21] <[sola]> so, basically i can't use nextAll
[06:25:31] <Velveeta> not for child elements, no
[06:25:31] <[sola]> which method will work for this situation ?
[06:25:36] <Velveeta> .find()
[06:26:44] <[sola]> ok.
[06:26:52] <[sola]> how can use find element for orderly
[06:26:59] <[sola]> find()[1]
[06:27:00] <[sola]> ?
[06:27:35] <Velveeta> it depends on how you're indexing those… are you indexing them by the order they're encountered in the dom, or by their nesting level?
[06:28:02] <Velveeta> so do you want your immediate children to be ordered 0 .. N, or do you want the first table and all of its child tables to be 0 .. N ?
[06:28:43] <[sola]> i want to first table, next all childs,  after that operation,  i want to go second table , .....
[06:29:11] <[sola]> last table scraping last .
[06:29:28] <Velveeta> then .find should work fine
[06:29:40] <Velveeta> and to index them by number, if you use the .get() function
[06:29:47] <Velveeta> or you can just reference them by array index
[06:30:10] <Velveeta> var tables = $('#divId').find('table'); tables[0]; tables[1]; etc
[06:30:12] <[sola]> can you give me a simple example
[06:30:18] <[sola]> i love you man
[06:30:21] <Velveeta> or tables.get(0); etc
[06:30:39] <[sola]> i will tryit now.
[06:30:43] <Velveeta> make sure you cache that .find() off to a variable reference or else you'll be parsing the dom everytime, which is yucky
[06:58:06] <[sola]> var k= $('#ContentPlaceHolder1_Kurumlar').find('table');
[06:58:07] <[sola]> k[0].find('td').each(function() {
[06:58:12] <[sola]> console.log( $(this).html() );
[06:58:18] <[sola]> });
[06:58:47] <[sola]> Velveeta: what i'm can you debug this code plase.
[06:59:00] <[sola]> it should work, but it isn't
[06:59:57] <Velveeta> if you can make a jsfiddle out of it i can try to help debug it
[07:06:34] <[sola]> Vadtec: http://jsfiddle.net/U6hmV/  ( jsfiddle shows no problem. code works fine )
[07:07:43] <SuperTyp> hello everybody
[07:08:03] <SuperTyp> I am just creating a website for a friend of me and I have a problem I am stucked with
[07:08:13] <Velveeta> [sola] there's nothing in that jsfiddle link
[07:08:26] <Velveeta> supertyp: ask away
[07:08:40] <[sola]> http://jsfiddle.net/U6hmV/2/
[07:08:47] <SuperTyp> I want the page with any loading sequences + the side content shell slide-out and in which works fine for now
[07:09:04] <[sola]> how about now ?
[07:09:49] <SuperTyp> the problem is now, I have a menu with 5 "links" which should trigger the click function and depending on what content you are this content shell slide out and the clicked content shell slide in
[07:10:14] <SuperTyp> now I have the problem how can I figure out on what content I am currently so this content gets slide out
[07:10:41] <Velveeta> [sola]: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/U6hmV/5/
[07:10:51] <SuperTyp> I could manage this with 5! ifs but this is ugly imo
[07:11:10] <Velveeta> you were trying to reference the actual table node itself, instead of a jquery-wrapped version of it, so you just needed to add a jquery wrapper on that node
[07:11:48] <[sola]> $(k[0]) this is the problem. now i get it
[07:12:04] <[sola]> Thank you sir. you earn my respect.
[07:12:08] <Velveeta> supertyp: you can try adding some data- attributes to tell it what content is being clicked on
[07:12:16] <Velveeta> [sola]: no problem, glad i could help
[07:12:52] <Velveeta> supertyp: you could have like <a data-content-selector="#content1">Click me for content 1!</a>
[07:13:19] <Velveeta> and then in its click function, reference $($(this).data('contentSelector')); to get a handle to the content container
[07:15:07] <SuperTyp> I can replace the <a> tag right?
[07:15:18] <Velveeta> sure, you can use data-attributes on any node
[07:15:39] <SuperTyp> ok I will first check whats this data-attributes about =)
[07:16:07] <Velveeta> `api data @ supertyp
[07:16:08] <b-ot> supertyp: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[07:16:46] <Velveeta> and here's a writeup on data attributes in general: http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[07:21:13] <SuperTyp> hm I still cant see the difference between using the data attribute or e.g the id or class attribute, I have stlill to check with if clauses what attr is has to be slide in and which not, or am I missunderstanding this?
[07:23:10] <SuperTyp> I need something like this: If click on menu-item1----> load/slide-in content of menu-item1 and slide-out current content
[07:24:10] <Velveeta> right, so in order to store information about what content pertains to what link, you're going to have to store data about the relationship
[07:24:42] <Velveeta> you don't have to check anything with an if clause
[07:25:06] <Velveeta> if you can create a jsfiddle example what a sample layout, i can show you how to determine what content belongs to what menu item
[07:28:53] <SuperTyp> ok I will
[08:02:06] <SuperTyp> Velveeta here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/F6nvX/
[08:03:19] <SuperTyp> better: /*var currPage = 0;*/
[08:03:24] <SuperTyp> oh sry
[08:03:33] <SuperTyp> better: http://jsfiddle.net/F6nvX/1/
[08:04:29] <SuperTyp> as you can see if I use the id selector to slide a content out and in, this is crap, as I would have to this 3! for all contents
[08:05:05] <SuperTyp> http://jsfiddle.net/F6nvX/2/
[08:06:46] <SuperTyp> here I have only 3 list items but actually I have 5
[08:17:25] <caliel> good morning (UGT).
[08:17:28] <caliel> hello Cork :)
[08:18:49] <caliel> I have added a mobile menu navigation, an easy one, that is activated when $(window).width() is less than 1008. The problem is with the tablet. When the tablet is horizontal, the resolution is higher than 1008, but when it's vertical it's lower. So, to have the mobile menu, it's needed to refresh the page. How can I check this and avoid the page refresh ?
[08:21:38] <caliel> and viceversa of course
[08:48:29] <SuperTyp> caliel isnt it better to check if on mobile or not?
[08:48:43] <SuperTyp> instead of checking the width?
[09:29:03] <caliel> good morning (UGT)
[09:32:48] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/8gCca/ I'm trying to make a vertical scroll which scrolls when you sort of mouse over.. I actually had something that worked very poorly... but then I made a few changes and now it doesn't do anything at all. $scrollHeight is undefined apparently. It's like I made a typo but can't see it.
[09:36:22] <Armistice> Spotted the typo, had a lowercase h instead of an uppercase. http://jsfiddle.net/8gCca/1/ so now it sort of scrolls but it's just now how I want it. Any ideas how I can make it work as I want it to?
[09:44:16] <ckSynergy> can someone look over this? It's a simple show/hide script based on the rel of the hovering element, but doesnt want to fire off.
[09:44:17] <ckSynergy> http://pastebin.com/TgCDU2s7
[10:05:24] <caliel> why $(document).width() in Internet Explorer 8 gives strange values ?
[10:08:54] <sacho_> strange values like?
[10:09:31] <SuperTyp> Caliel I told not to check the width() check the current device instead
[10:10:01] <caliel> sacho_: for example, when the value is 1300 (for IE9 / FX), in IE8 it becomes 33412
[10:10:18] <caliel> SuperTyp: you mean using $(document).innerWidth() ?
[10:11:08] <SuperTyp> caliel you want at special menu been shown on devices with width < 1008 px right?
[10:11:32] <caliel> SuperTyp: yes. Maybe you wrote after I quitted, sorry.
[10:11:54] <SuperTyp> Isnt it better if you instead of checking the width looking for what device the user is on?
[10:13:48] <caliel> SuperTyp: no. Because, for example, if a user is on a tablet, he could take the tablet both horizzontally (1024x768) and vertically (768x1024). I used an addEventListener for orientation changes, but I solved better with this: http://bpaste.net/show/152405/ (ugly code)
[10:14:18] <caliel> SuperTyp: the problem, now, is that IE8 doesn't effect changes on the displaying, because it reads strange values for $(document).width();
[10:14:35] <caliel> (it's not supposed to be reusable code, it's just experimenting)
[10:14:55] <SuperTyp> why are you even supporting IE8?
[10:15:48] <SuperTyp> caliel maybe this is helpflull?
[10:15:53] <SuperTyp> -l
[10:15:55] <SuperTyp> http://api.jquerymobile.com/orientationchange/
[10:16:58] <caliel> SuperTyp: I used that (when I told you I used an add EventListener). But now the problem isn't that. The problem is that the code works in other browsers, but in IE8 no.
[10:17:38] <SuperTyp> maybe this has to do with the jquery version
[10:18:04] <SuperTyp> there are some things (I cant remember which) that doesnt work on IE8 with jquery 191 I think
[10:18:45] <caliel> SuperTyp: and I have to support IE8 because it's the second preferred version of the browser on the site I will put this code on (the final version, this is just experimental).
[10:19:09] <caliel> SuperTyp: I need this, because I will use jQuery to switch between folders and take the right version of the image for the devices.
[10:20:20] <SuperTyp> hm okay, well I cant help you then as my jQuery skills are not that good
[10:20:32] <caliel> SuperTyp: now I have a $(document).width() of 1350 (full page) in FX and IE9... in IE8 (and 7 just checked) it says 34026.
[10:20:53] <SuperTyp> 34026 :D
[10:20:59] <caliel> ahahahah
[10:21:08] <caliel> for that it will never load the responsiveMenu().
[10:21:35] <caliel> But I cannot suppose that doing x - 32676 < 1008 will be a correct answer :D
[10:21:49] <SuperTyp> :D
[10:22:55] <caliel> SuperTyp: interesting... $(document).width() gives 34026 but $(window).width() says 1259 Oo
[10:23:18] <SuperTyp> this seems bugged
[10:23:33] <caliel> Maybe it would be safer using .width() on an inner element, the one on which I am supposed to apply the responsiveMenu
[10:23:37] <SuperTyp> which jquery do you use?
[10:23:48] <caliel> SuperTyp: 1.x (the last one) with jQuery migration plugin
[10:24:14] <SuperTyp> caliel this is what I would recommend too, but I am looking right now for known bugs with width on IE8
[10:24:49] <caliel> SuperTyp: I think it would be safer to check $('#mainContents .menu').width(). In the 1-line version it is 960px. Lower, I could apply the menu.
[10:25:15] <caliel> But this is a workaround, I suppose I will have problems in checking the viewport dimensions and choose the right folder with the reduced images.
[10:25:49] <SuperTyp> mate
[10:25:54] <SuperTyp> caliel look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16564123/jquery-width-issues-in-ie-8
[10:27:18] <caliel> well I have read earlier that with IE8 you have to wait for DOM to be fully loaded (I had problems in delaying the script loading)
[10:28:25] <caliel> but that solution doesn't work
[10:30:04] <caliel> IE sucks
[10:30:19] <caliel> can we create a jQuery fork called IEsucks ?
[10:30:32] <caliel> just a function... IEsucks.destroy();
[10:34:48] <SuperTyp> :D
[10:35:02] <SuperTyp> I am out, cya!
[10:53:32] <jop008> I am debugging my ode window.location.replace ( "vw-bookperson.htm?objectID=" + objectID ); I have this
[10:53:48] <jop008> my page does nothing with this line
[11:08:47] <jop008> I have this line I am debugging my ode window.location.replace ( "vw-bookperson.htm?objectID=" + objectID ); I  in debugger
[11:09:00] <jop008> which is doing nothing no replace
[11:11:27] <jop008> maybe I am using it in an ajax function which is not allowed?
[11:11:31] <jop008> wild guess
[11:15:42] <jop008> If I do window.location.replace it responds with inactive code
[11:15:50] <jop008> when can it be inactive?
[11:16:46] <tables> how can i do POSTs or GETs with an <a href> link and then post the same response to a <div> area?
[11:18:03] <jop008> Why is code becoming inactive?
[11:18:24] <jop008> window.location.replace
[11:18:35] <jop008> is not active but why?
[11:41:46] <Cache_Money> I have an <ul> with a bunch of players.  I can sort them here:  http://jsfiddle.net/UsY4S/   But I'd like to make it so there is a distinction for the top five being a 'Starter" - which I can't get to work http://jsfiddle.net/UsY4S/1/

[12:51:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> rescane the qr code and tell me if it occurs
[12:51:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: thatnks for your help....most would not bother
[12:51:38] <MrPoxipol> knows anyone why the $(form).submit() doesn't work? jquery 1.9.1 the code works before, but not now
[12:52:11] <grafi> its always interesting seeing what others are doing :P
[12:52:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> MrPoxipol: jsfiddle please?
[12:52:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: lol yup
[12:52:29] <MrPoxipol> ok w8
[12:52:40] <grafi> yeah, error is back application.js:62
[12:52:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay will check
[12:52:58] <grafi> evaluating e.originalEvent.touches[0]
[12:53:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know im looking
[12:53:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> because before i got error in the touchstart
[12:53:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> hodl up editing
[12:54:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: https://share.appgyver.com/?id=6643&hash=36eb238aebc694a12f202b4b6a7c61b444af9e1445dab1faa98b05705eaf1858&device_type=iphone
[12:54:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> try now
[12:55:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> removed some code
[12:55:46] <grafi> looks like that did the trick
[12:55:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i think mouse events were messing stuff up
[12:56:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: and your probably wondering why i created my own stuff instead of using plugin
[12:56:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> 1 reason: this is bound for mobile and memory consumption is important
[13:03:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: so what are you working on
[13:04:11] <grafi> besides world domination?
[13:04:12] <grafi> :D
[13:05:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[13:11:02] <Cache_Money> How would I isolate the top 5 items in a sortable() <ul>?  http://jsfiddle.net/UsY4S/2/
[13:11:20] <Cache_Money> I'm trying to create a roster and allow the user to drag and drop the starting players into one of the top 5 slots
[13:18:40] <hugo_moss> hey, im adding a class "unscrollable" to the html, body, and then attaching an on( "dommousescroll mousewheel touchmove" ) handler, in chrome this works fine, the unscrollable class is added to the body, and when i scroll inside another window through propagation to the body or scrolling directly on the body, it doesn't scroll.  however, in ie10, when i scroll within another window that propagates
[13:18:40] <hugo_moss> to the body, it still scrolls, however it doesnt scroll when the mouse is directly on the body
[13:19:12] <hugo_moss> what am i doing wrong?
[13:19:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: every time an element snaps into place recolor all the items such that hte first five are blue
[13:20:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: so basically isntead of adding abckground color to a group, add it to each elemnt
[13:22:03] <Cache_Money> Rohan_Bhangui:  That sounds like it will work.  is it possible to have a container div within the <ul>?
[13:22:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> why?
[13:22:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: why would you need a container
[13:23:13] <Cache_Money> I'd like a border and different styles for the starters
[13:23:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> well you can add border to the ul right?
[13:24:19] <Cache_Money> to the whole ul yes, but i only want a border around the top 5
[13:24:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> well you could do something like
[13:25:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> n-thchild
[13:25:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> stuff
[13:25:12] <Cache_Money> ok
[13:25:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> so basically in your css
[13:26:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> ul li:first-child {
[13:26:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> border-top: 1px solid #ff0000;
[13:26:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then use
[13:26:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: ul li:n-thchild(5) {
[13:27:26] <Cache_Money> Rohan_Bhangui: Sweet.  Thanks for getting me started in the right direction
[13:27:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> meh no problem
[13:32:15] <netAction> Hi! element.css('font-size',fontSize); does not block the script until the page has been repainted. element.width() before and after the call returns the same value. What is the way to let jQuery wait?
[13:34:02] <frank_o> Hi!
[13:34:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: welcome back
[13:34:17] <frank_o> Is it possible to set up an infinite scrolling testcase on JSFiddle? My attempt with the "next page" as another fiddle did not work so well: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/jGa5v/ :)
[13:34:32] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: Oh hey! Thanks man, how's it going?
[13:34:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> goign well just about to get off #jquery for a while but i guess  i could help
[13:35:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: so you said you want infinitscrolling working?
[13:35:41] <frank_o> Nice
[13:35:49] <frank_o> Yep
[13:36:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> what you could do is test scrolTop
[13:36:13] <frank_o> Well it is working but not through JSFiddle. I need to make it work through JSFiddle so I can illustrate this other problem I'm having.
[13:36:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then load content accordingly
[13:36:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhh welll
[13:36:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> your infinite scroll should really be using scrollTop
[13:37:29] <Cache_Money> Rohan_Bhangui:  How would I style the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th <li> with borders on the left and right?
[13:37:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: you should be appending content
[13:37:42] <Cache_Money> Do I need to do a separate nth-child() for each?
[13:38:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: ae their 7 items fixed or more items can be added?
[13:38:26] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: Am currently using simple but solid infinite scrolling plugin for jQuery Mobile: https://github.com/kpheasey/jqm.infinitescroll
[13:38:35] <Cache_Money> There may will be more than 7
[13:38:54] <frank_o> It's working great, I'm just not sure how to demo it over at JSFiddle
[13:38:56] <Cache_Money> will be anywhere from 5-15
[13:39:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay well ya
[13:39:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would do
[13:40:00] <grafi> frank_o http://jsfiddle.net/jGa5v/1/ this is closer to working, included jqm, and selected a jquery version that actually still support .live(), how you could load in the other content though, no idea :P
[13:40:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[13:41:00] <frank_o> grafi: Thanks :)
[13:41:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: i would do it this way
[13:41:20] <Cache_Money> gotcha
[13:41:25] <Cache_Money> Rohan_Bhangui: thanks
[13:41:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya np
[13:41:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[13:41:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> im out
[13:41:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> cya in a bit guys
[13:42:04] <frank_o> Take care Rohan_Bhangui!
[13:42:53] <Cache_Money> Rohan_Bhangui: Don't you think the UX is a little funky with this approach?  http://jsfiddle.net/UsY4S/3/
[13:44:15] <grafi> why do you think Cache_Money?
[13:45:29] <Cache_Money> grafi: the border looks weird and when you grab the 1st or 5th player it drags the border along with the player
[13:45:52] <grafi> well you could apply some styling for that case
[13:46:06] <Cache_Money> what about the second case?
[13:46:25] <grafi> that too
[13:46:38] <frank_o> grafi: Why do we need to support live in this case?
[13:46:46] <grafi> dragged items get a certain class applied
[13:47:09] <grafi> frank_o the infinite scroll plugin you use required .live as well as $.mobile
[13:49:17] <frank_o> Ah ok. Yeah, using it with 1.10.1 here locally. Anyway as for loading content, maybe it'd be as simple as loading content from another jQM page in the same fiddle? :O
[13:50:06] <Cache_Money> grafi: Can you show me how I would remove the border of an <li> when it's being dragged?  http://jsfiddle.net/UsY4S/3/
[13:50:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> back for a bit
[13:51:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: how goes it
[13:51:07] <frank_o> I mean 1.x edge
[13:55:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> ???
[13:55:26] <grafi> frank_o yeah not sure, pulling in actual content in jsfiddle always eluded me
[13:56:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: oh forgot to mention: :lt is a jquery extension and is *NOT* apart of css
[13:56:44] <frank_o> grafi: Oopsie forgot I was using this https://github.com/kpheasey/jqm.infinitescroll/pull/1
[13:57:03] <frank_o> grafi: I think I got it working now though
[13:57:10] <grafi> cool
[14:01:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: are you familiar with pseudo classes
[14:02:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> :before and :after
[14:02:06] <grafi> sure
[14:02:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> are there any others
[14:02:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> like that
[14:02:32] <grafi> :before:before
[14:02:35] <grafi> or what?
[14:02:35] <grafi> ^^
[14:02:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i need to
[14:02:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> do something like this
[14:02:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQp8PK-xrWPff7gWY9o_7cje7lPyHSqekZ4zNLpfyab8hexHBjKyQ
[14:03:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> see the slider
[14:03:10] <grafi> yup
[14:03:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> how it has the brightness and
[14:03:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i figured id use :before and :after for the icons
[14:03:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> but for the actuall slider knob
[14:03:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> what shoul i sue
[14:03:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> *use
[14:03:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would prefer to do it in one like how i did the toggle switch
[14:04:16] <grafi> hm
[14:04:33] <grafi> dont you have to use more than one element anyway
[14:04:40] <grafi> for the line + color
[14:04:42] <grafi> and stuff
[14:04:58] <grafi> i have never seen a slider even without icons that uses just one element
[14:05:22] <grafi> sounds like this could be a good use for shadowDOM
[14:05:29] <grafi> too bad its not there yet xD
[14:05:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: http://codepen.io/hauptrolle/pen/yfejp
[14:05:45] <hugo_moss> hey, im adding a class "unscrollable" to the html, body, and then attaching an on( "dommousescroll mousewheel touchmove" ) handler, in chrome this works fine, the unscrollable class is added to the body, and when i scroll inside another window through propagation to the body or scrolling directly on the body, it doesn't scroll.  however, in ie10, when i scroll within another window that propagates
[14:05:45] <hugo_moss> to the body, it still scrolls, however it doesnt scroll when the mouse is directly on the body
[14:05:51] <Cache_Money> Rohan_Bhangui: Sorry, took a break to play the piano.  I'm trying to figure out how to keep the border from dragging with one of the first 5 <li>'s  http://jsfiddle.net/UsY4S/3/
[14:05:56] <frank_o> grafi: Not sure, it seems to load it all in at once: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/jGa5v/3/
[14:06:06] <hugo_moss> what am i doing wrong?
[14:06:18] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui nifty
[14:06:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: im assuming that there are some events you could access that would allow you to do that
[14:06:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> like a ondrop event
[14:06:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then you can restyle
[14:06:55] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: oooh that looks nice!
[14:07:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: i didnt creat that
[14:07:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> its just something i found
[14:07:30] <Cache_Money> Rohan_Bhangui: Is there something like "ondrag"?  That's when it looks weird, when I drag on of the 5 players that has a border
[14:07:47] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: Where'd you find it?
[14:08:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> just googled "ios7 slider codepen
[14:08:13] <frank_o> ah :)
[14:08:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: are you using jqm or jquery ui
[14:08:34] <Cache_Money> jqueryUI
[14:08:38] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: there's https://github.com/zmyaro/holo-web too if you're into that kinda stuff
[14:09:00] <frank_o> i believe i found it when i googled "android slider" :P
[14:09:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: the point is to build from scratch
[14:09:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/
[14:09:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: i was using this before http://chocolatechip-ui.com/
[14:10:21] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: yeah i built my android slider from scratch but i got most of my ideas off holo-web
[14:10:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya...as a guide for sure
[14:10:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> but the app im building is using phonegap and is targeted towards iphone/ android
[14:10:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[14:11:54] <frank_o> yeah i think that ios7 slider looks way better than the android4 one
[14:12:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[14:12:35] <frank_o> less details
[14:12:41] <frank_o> so thanks for sharing
[14:12:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> ios7 looks much better
[14:12:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol np
[14:13:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> the point is that i should be able to write a common html
[14:13:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then switch out the css files easily
[14:13:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[14:13:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> brb
[14:18:01] <Cache_Money> Rohan_Bhangui: What's wrong with this approach?  http://jsfiddle.net/UsY4S/4/
[14:18:51] <zquad> I am in an iframe, I need to call an method in the parent when iframe is closed, .unload() is depreciated what event handles the iframe closing?
[14:19:56] <zquad> rather just before unload
[14:27:28] <frank_o> grafi: I think it's working: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/jGa5v/6/
[14:28:58] <grafi> frank_o seems like it
[14:29:12] <zquad> am I invisible?
[14:29:28] <shoky> only when no one's looking
[14:29:29] <grafi> zquad idk i cant see you
[14:29:40] <zquad> :)
[14:29:47] <Falko> i think i can see you... not
[14:30:41] <zquad> so what is jquery just before unload/close function
[14:32:30] <shoky> there's the beforeunload event. no idea how it works for iframes
[14:38:59] <grafi> shoky.beforeunload
[14:39:06] <grafi> x.
[15:31:12] <frank_o> Is there a way to launch infinite scrolling for the jQuery Mobile page #main when I'm scrolling inside #cloned? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/syx45/
[15:32:22] <frank_o> Sorry http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/syx45/1/
[15:34:33] <fictive> How can I disable the checkbox from being clicked, but still go through with the performMarkClick method as intended when clicking both button and the checkbox? http://jsfiddle.net/h3tJc/
[15:39:19] <fictive> With no preventDefault or stopPropagation the performMarkClick method is run twice, but with them nothing happens
[15:45:38] <frank_o> Drastically simplified my case if anybody's around:
[15:45:45] <shoky> fictive: try the checkbox's 'change' event instead of 'click'
[15:46:04] <frank_o> Is there a way to launch infinite scrolling for Page A when in Page B? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/syx45/5/ (jQM)
[15:47:09] <fictive> shoky: the method still runs twice :/
[15:47:30] <fictive> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/kLy86/1/ this kind of works, but not if the mouse leaves the checkbox
[15:58:40] <shoky> fictive: well you'd need to handle mouseup on the button for fixing that. http://jsfiddle.net/kLy86/2/
[16:04:49] <Cache_Money> How do I select only the first 5 <li>'s?  Or do I need to select them all and look at the index and skip if beyond the 5th elem?
[16:05:37] <shoky> ?api :lt
[16:05:38] <b-ot> shoky: :lt() Selector: Select all elements at an index less than <code>index</code> within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[16:05:56] <Cache_Money> shoky: thanks
[16:05:57] <shoky> ?api slice
[16:05:57] <b-ot> shoky: .slice(): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[16:08:42] <fictive> shoky: ahaa, so the event propagates from the lowest to the highest element? I thought it was the other way around!
[16:09:35] <shoky> fictive: donno whats lowest/highest, but it propagates from the checkbox to the button
[16:11:03] <fictive> shoky: so when I now click the button, the button event is fired first and then the checkbox?
[16:11:30] <shoky> fictive: when you click the button, outside of the checkbox?
[16:11:41] <shoky> fictive: then no event is fired on the checkbox..
[16:14:57] <fictive> shoky: when clicking the button, only the button mouse up event is fired of course. but when I click the checkbox, is the mouseup-event on the button fired before checkbox.click? some console logging tells me so, but then I don't think I understand how stopPropagation works
[16:15:06] <fictive> anyway, thank you so much =)
[16:16:33] <shoky> fictive: yes mouseup is fired before click
[16:16:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: how goes it?
[16:16:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: what up
[16:16:53] <shoky> fictive: stopPropagation works for each event type separately
[16:17:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: hey
[16:18:25] <TylerEHome> What is the proper way to chain selectors? what I'm trying to do is $(a_js_object).$("some selector"). The Js object is the result of iterating over an outer selector
[16:19:12] <shoky> TylerEHome: either .find or .filter  depending on what exactly you're trying to do
[16:20:27] <shoky> donno what you mean by "the result of iterating over an outer selector"
[16:21:36] <TylerEHome> shocky...basically I'm iterating over all matches to a selector, and calling a function, passing the found object. inside the function I need to work with the object
[16:22:08] <shoky> this would be much simpler with a small jsfiddle demo
[16:22:25] <TylerEHome> shoky: if the code was simple I wouldn't be having this issue ;)
[16:22:45] <TylerEHome> filter seems to be doing the trick though, thanks
[16:22:46] <shoky> didn't know there's an issue ;p
[16:27:28] <fictive> shoky: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html well this helped a lot! =)

[17:02:46] <Cache_Money> I currently use hide() and show() but I'd like to slide it in from the right to give it some fluidity

[17:37:37] <olarf> http://4legs.de/fourlegs/stick.html when you click on the first tile (upper left) there are two links (LEFT and RIGHT) in red font displayed. But when you click any other link on the page and than back on the first tile the links will be hidden behind other elements.
[17:38:02] <olarf> i dont know why this is happening. I beliefe it has something to do with the "load()" function

[19:50:15] <haleys> If I want a script to run on either pressing enter or using a mouse click, is there a combined event for that? i saw on stoackoverflow that you could do it this way, but seems choppy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155188/trigger-a-button-click-with-javascript-on-the-enter-key-in-a-text-box
[19:50:18] <grafi> Smells Like Teen Spirit Remix - Girls Night aha
[19:50:19] <grafi> xD
[19:51:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahaha
[19:51:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:51:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> who wouldnt
[19:51:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> its ma youtube bud
[19:51:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> haleys: not really
[19:51:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[19:52:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> haleys: you could use .trigger("click");
[19:53:50] <haleys> Rohan_Bhangui: So do a keypress event, and then put the .trigger("click") inside that?
[19:54:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[19:54:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> haleys: [selector].trigger("click");
[19:54:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> but youd have to write what the click event does
[19:55:21] <grafi> what kind of script are we talking about anyways?
[19:55:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> haleys: wants the enter key and click to execute the same code
[19:55:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^grafi
[19:56:12] <grafi> yeah but like what
[19:56:15] <grafi> validation?
[19:56:20] <grafi> some random stuff
[19:56:32] <grafi> do i press enter inside a form
[19:56:33] <grafi> etc pp
[19:56:56] <haleys> grafi: I'm using twitter's typeahead plugin, and I am tieing an action to it when the user clicks on the result from the list or press enter when the result has been highlighted
[19:58:20] <grafi> then do what Rohan_Bhangui said :D
[19:58:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:58:38] <haleys> so it's an input field, which displays multiple results in div's/spans underneath the input field. i.e. if it was countries, and you typed "united", you would have several results like "United Kingdom" "United States", etc.
[19:58:54] <grafi> yup
[20:00:02] <grafi> funny that the library doesnt already support this
[20:00:03] <grafi> :o
[20:03:37] <haleys> Got it. So the executable code for both the enter keypress and the click, will be inside the clicks event, and the click event is triggered inside the keypress event
[20:03:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> haleys: ????? why are you do ing that
[20:03:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> *doing
[20:04:49] <grafi> you just told him to
[20:04:50] <grafi> no?
[20:16:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[20:16:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> hes wrapping bot
[20:16:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> when really
[20:16:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> he only needs to do code for clikc
[20:16:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then do trigger("click")
[20:28:36] <VectorX> hi is this wrong, jQuery(this).children(".radioButton")[0].attr("name") ?
[20:28:44] <VectorX> im getting undefined on that
[20:33:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: let me make fiddle to illustrate
[20:36:20] <VectorX> i am trying to get the first <input with class radioButton that is inside a h4
[20:36:28] <VectorX> its a bootstrap accordian code
[20:38:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh
[20:38:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[20:38:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/H73Ux/2/
[20:38:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> im working off this
[20:38:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: if you see console it says that attr is not recognized for the html object
[20:41:36] <VectorX> right
[20:43:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: do you need to always get the first value?
[20:43:50] <VectorX> im trying to check the radio
[20:44:06] <VectorX> the example is a bit wrong, im trying to make one but having some issues myself
[20:44:15] <VectorX> http://jsfiddle.net/r3Spw/29/
[20:44:30] <VectorX> actually we worked on a different issue of this few weeks back
[20:44:45] <VectorX> checking the radio when collapsing
[20:45:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i remember
[20:45:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was helping
[20:45:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> um okay:
[20:45:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> so you need to get the name of the radio button thats selected right?
[20:46:06] <VectorX> no
[20:46:19] <VectorX> im trying to fix the css in the example
[20:46:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> the first radio button?
[20:46:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> whats wrong iwth it
[20:46:57] <VectorX> but you can click in the white space of the accordian headings and it will collapse expand, but then the radio doesnt get selected
[20:48:09] <VectorX> im guessing, .panel-title so when it is cluicked i want the radio to get checked
[20:48:20] <VectorX> i was trying to print the name to see if it was getting selected
[20:48:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: i made a small mod
[20:48:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> so that when you click in the red space of each lbael
[20:48:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> it gets selcted
[20:49:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> see here
[20:49:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/r3Spw/30/
[20:49:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> thought im still triyng to get rid of padidng which i suspect is apart of bootstrap
[20:51:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: i would play with the css on each
[20:52:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> and see what you get
[20:52:55] <VectorX> Rohan_Bhangui i think that is a good solution
[20:53:13] <VectorX> i dont need height there, so its fine
[20:53:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> are you usre
[20:53:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would wnat the whole area selctable
[20:54:17] <VectorX> well this way people would try to click on the text
[20:55:01] <grafi> which would be good ux?
[20:58:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> VectorX: are you usre you dont want whole area click able?
[21:00:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause it can be
[21:00:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> done
[21:00:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> just turn off padding for panel-heaing
[21:05:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> *panel-heading
[21:11:42] <VectorX> Rohan_Bhangui that would be a mess, bootstrap would go wonkers
[21:11:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> not really
[21:12:02] <grafi> the joys of bootstrap :P
[21:12:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> all you have to do is turn the padding for .panel-heading
[21:12:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> off
[21:12:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> i wnat to create something front end based
[21:12:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> that possibly rivals bootstrap
[21:12:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> somethignw here some one can write basic html
[21:12:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> no spicla classes and tags
[21:12:40] <grafi> apparently that cant be done ^^
[21:12:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> *special
[21:12:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[21:12:53] <grafi> make a repo
[21:12:55] <grafi> im in
[21:12:56] <grafi> ^^
[21:13:01] <VectorX> yeah which would effect all the accordians, i only needs this behaviour for this, and dont want to have to add a crap load of css just to turn off padding
[21:13:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> i shouwed you what i oculd do with input type checkbox grafi
[21:13:09] <VectorX> ie, i would have to change all the meida queries etc
[21:13:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> alright grafi
[21:13:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> your on
[21:13:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> but not so soon
[21:13:34] <grafi> lawl
[21:13:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill get started slowly
[21:13:40] <grafi> its never going to be done
[21:13:41] <grafi> :D
[21:13:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> it will be
[21:14:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> it will require planning and  creative thinking
[21:14:14] <grafi> plan
[21:14:15] <grafi> go
[21:14:17] <grafi> do it
[21:14:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> and if we do fail we can add some special classes
[21:14:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:14:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> not so soon
[21:14:27] <grafi> well you need some classes
[21:14:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> im studying for exmas
[21:14:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> *exmas
[21:14:38] <grafi> what about a grid system
[21:14:41] <grafi> ^^
[21:14:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> grid well
[21:14:53] <grafi> menu types probably
[21:14:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> we can make a data-X attribute
[21:14:57] <grafi> on top the nav element
[21:15:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> that says like 2 or 3
[21:15:05] <grafi> hm
[21:15:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then that means the children are spilt in 3
[21:15:19] <grafi> wondering if that would be cooler than classes
[21:15:20] <grafi> ^^
[21:15:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure it would
[21:15:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> it would require a hell of alot more jquery
[21:15:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> but
[21:15:37] <grafi> what if i want 1/3 2/3 ?
[21:16:05] <grafi> grids are fucking hard
[21:16:11] <grafi> im always annoyed
[21:16:23] <grafi> have yet to find one that i like
[21:16:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol build your own
[21:16:47] <grafi> too lazy for the cool stuff
[21:16:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> the whole point grafi
[21:16:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> is that you should not require extra shit
[21:16:59] <grafi> sure
[21:16:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> it should be basic
[21:17:01] <grafi> im with you
[21:17:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> kind alike how chocolate chip ui
[21:17:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> works
[21:17:23] <grafi> just put in in, and it looks like something
[21:17:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> you write code once (the html0
[21:17:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> then you can pick the style sheet
[21:17:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya basically
[21:17:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> the idea is rapid prototyping
[21:18:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> we should include basic classes
[21:18:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> like for exmaple if someone wants to have page transtions
[21:18:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> you usually wrap each page in a div
[21:18:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> with class page
[21:18:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> so we need a class for that
[21:18:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you get the idea
[21:18:50] <grafi> im just waiting for you to start the repo xD
[21:18:56] <grafi> haha
[21:19:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol ill strat one right now
[21:19:41] <grafi> xD
[21:19:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> well get a basic strucure in place
[21:19:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> we can build from scratch together
[21:20:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> give me 1 sec
[21:20:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> of course grafi: design should be flat minimalism
[21:20:32] <grafi> cool stuff
[21:20:33] <grafi> ;)
[21:21:19] <grafi> sass or less? ^^
[21:22:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> sass i think
[21:22:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> although i still have to learn it
[21:22:11] <grafi> phew

[21:46:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> i live and breath design

[21:46:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> *branding
[21:47:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> but content is equally improtant
[21:47:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> *important
[21:48:05] <grafi> :]
[21:48:15] <grafi> equally less important ^^
[21:48:21] <grafi> *cough*
[21:48:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:48:33] <grafi> just look at the xbone
[21:48:36] <raj> Rohan_Bhangui, twitter bootstrap?
[21:48:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: something dead simple
[21:49:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> just apply and the framework manages the styling
[21:49:06] <grafi> like put stylesheet in there, shit just works
[21:49:07] <grafi> :P
[21:49:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> basically
[21:49:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> adn eventually we can make it customization
[21:49:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> like a theme roller or something
[21:49:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> though i think we might use sass to do this initially
[21:49:54] <grafi> sass is always good
[21:49:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> thank god for sass and its colors that can be specified as variables
[21:50:10] <grafi> tru dad
[21:50:12] <raj> twitter bootstrap is like that
[21:50:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i think we should start off wtih a bsic structure
[21:50:17] <raj> you just use the right classes
[21:50:24] <grafi> exactly
[21:50:25] <grafi> ^^
[21:50:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: the point is
[21:50:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> add css and its ready to go
[21:50:48] <raj> ya, twitter bootstrap
[21:50:57] <raj> you can override whatever css you want
[21:50:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: one issue
[21:51:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> its not flat
[21:51:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: jks ^^
[21:51:11] <raj> it's 3d?
[21:51:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> XD
[21:51:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is bad
[21:52:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: we are figuring stuff out as we go along

[21:54:04] <raj> more than okay
[21:54:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> abjorn: it is very okay XD
[21:54:07] <raj> recommended

[21:54:17] <abjorn> im always one or the other
[21:54:21] <raj> sleep deprived and drunk is pointless though

[21:54:23] <grafi> exactly
[21:54:30] <raj> might as well get some rest and start drunk in the morning

[21:56:34] <grafi> what do you intend to put up now?
[21:56:39] <raj> abjorn, if I was to load a page using ajax, should I destroy the other page the person was on? or leaving it .hidden is fine (in case they re-open that page, in which case I would just hide the current one and unhide the one they want)
[21:56:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: what you mean?
[21:56:52] <grafi> roadmap kind of thing?
[21:56:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh
[21:56:58] <grafi> or just mission statement
[21:56:59] <grafi> :P
[21:57:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> dead simple css and js/jquery for quickly prototyping flat design websites
[21:57:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> add water and ready
[21:57:46] <raj> like, how important is it to delete DOM elements that are not currently being used (whether it be in a dialog, or whatever)
[21:57:49] <abjorn> raj: I wouldn't hide it so much as detach that part of the dom, if you expect hte user to go back to it
[21:58:01] <raj> detach?
[21:58:01] <grafi> add water and ready
[21:58:02] <abjorn> BUT either works
[21:58:07] <grafi> where did you steal that
[21:58:12] <grafi> that should be our motto ^^
[21:58:13] <abjorn> yeah, you can have DOM fragments that aren't attached to the main document
[21:58:17] <abjorn> you can cache it somewhere
[21:58:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> a few places use that line
[21:58:23] <abjorn> but it doesn't *much* matter
[21:58:26] <raj> will that slow down the page?
[21:58:42] <raj> or does detaching it prevent it from using memory?
[21:58:42] <abjorn> probably not, but when you're debugging it's certainly easier to have only one page in the DOM
[21:58:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: okay so i think we should segment our frameowrk 1 for mobile and 1 for web
[21:58:52] <abjorn> oh it'll use memory
[21:58:56] <abjorn> that's for sure
[21:59:02] <raj> ya, so my concern is memory and performance
[21:59:04] <abjorn> this is the DOM we're talking about here
[21:59:09] <raj> should I be destroying DOM elements if they aren't being used?
[21:59:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: web will be primary focus for now
[21:59:20] <grafi> thats fine with me
[21:59:21] <grafi> :)
[21:59:24] <raj> and re-building them when theyre needed
[21:59:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:59:25] <abjorn> well, memory performance and cpu performance are on opposite ends of the spectrum
[21:59:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay first roder
[21:59:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> *order
[21:59:35] <raj> I want to read on performance
[21:59:35] <abjorn> typically to get cpu performance you take a memory hit and vice versa
[21:59:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> typography
[21:59:39] <abjorn> (not universally true)
[21:59:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> what choices we have
[22:00:00] <raj> I'm just concerned about performance as experienced by the end-user
[22:00:01] <grafi> fucking youtube showing me vine compilation only ._.
[22:00:08] <abjorn> keep in mind, unless you're expecting a large number of mobile users, memory is much much cheaper
[22:00:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[22:00:26] <raj> why does mobile matter for memory?
[22:00:30] <raj> mobile browsers have little of it?
[22:00:42] <abjorn> phones have less memory than the average desktop
[22:00:43] <grafi> ask apple users ^^
[22:01:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: so we can use: helvetica, montserrat, roboto
[22:01:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> any others in mind
[22:01:28] <grafi> wingdings
[22:01:30] <grafi> oô
[22:01:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[22:01:47] <raj> abjorn, got any readings for me?
[22:01:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> but seriously
[22:01:56] <grafi> helvetica is cool

[22:02:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> *roboto
[22:02:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> the antialiasing is great
[22:02:58] <grafi> maybe on your mac ^^
[22:03:01] <abjorn> raj: I would cache pages unless the data rendered on the page changes a lot.
[22:03:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> naw bro even on windows
[22:03:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: soruce sans pro also looks amzing
[22:03:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> *amaing

[22:04:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> or something similar
[22:04:47] <abjorn> raj: whatever page you're thinking about caching
[22:04:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: so whats it gonna be
[22:05:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i could also get my hands on this

[22:22:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> what if we do this
[22:22:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> light grey dark grey text
[22:22:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> drak grey white text

[22:23:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> even throw in a slate color
[22:23:42] <grafi> i like that
[22:25:24] <s5fs> jquery.com is back up
[22:25:51] <grafi> was it down oô
[22:26:13] <s5fs> yeah, for the last hour, roughly
[22:26:17] <grafi> crazy
[22:26:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya it was
[22:26:29] <grafi> i feel like that was the case last week too
[22:26:30] <grafi> oô
[22:26:36] <grafi> or the week before that
[22:26:37] <s5fs> grafi: spot on, same issue too
[22:26:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/
[22:27:03] <grafi> so whats the issue ôo
[22:27:34] <grafi> s5fs are you in the know?
[22:27:54] <s5fs> when our host backs up their systems, it locks up the virtual machine that runs the jquery sites
[22:28:23] <s5fs> lemme rephrase that
[22:28:48] <s5fs> when the hosting provider backs up their virtual environment, it's interrupting nginx on the jquery server
[22:29:16] <s5fs> this has happened about three times in the past month
[22:29:34] <grafi> well at least they have backups :|
[22:30:00] <s5fs> grafi: yeah, i'm one of the jquery infrastructure team members
[22:30:02] <s5fs> haha, indeed
[22:30:45] <grafi> cool stuff
[22:31:12] <s5fs> yeah fun stuff
[22:31:18] <grafi> until it stops working
[22:31:19] <grafi> :)
[22:31:34] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/tTru3N6.gif
[22:31:42] <s5fs> nah, that's when it gets really interesting!
[22:32:02] <grafi> oh, you're one of those people ^^
[22:33:08] <s5fs> someone has to do it
[22:33:31] <grafi> for sure, but you could still be annoyed when stuff doesnt work
[22:33:31] <s5fs> okay folks, back to the couch. hopefully the server stays running, haha!
[22:33:33] <grafi> :D
[22:33:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: lol fuck it wont style
[22:34:13] <grafi> fuck who?
[22:34:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> fuck as in shit
[22:34:38] <grafi> i see
[22:34:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> fuck = damn = shit = i fail
[22:34:44] <grafi> you fail
[22:34:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[22:34:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> the button wont styl
[22:34:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> see the repo
[22:35:03] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/gcshnBn.gif
[22:35:04] <grafi> hahah^^
[22:35:13] <grafi> HAMMER what are you doing!!!
[22:36:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: should be using input type="button
[22:36:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> or <button>
[22:36:20] <grafi> type button oô
[22:36:23] <grafi> is that a thing
[22:37:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> button tag or type button?
[22:37:31] <grafi> we should be using input[type="button"]/input[type="submit"]
[22:38:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[22:38:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> also we will need to style links as buttons
[22:39:11] <grafi> yes?
[22:42:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> problem
[22:42:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> the hieght for links vs. input type button
[22:42:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> is different
[22:43:55] <grafi> why are we styling links like buttons again?
[22:46:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> say someone wants a signup button
[22:46:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> to go to signup page
[22:47:25] <grafi> sure but thats not the default is it
[22:48:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb016I95WWc
[22:48:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> no
[22:48:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> im setting defaults right now
[22:48:43] <grafi> cool cool
[22:48:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> well yes
[22:48:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry
[22:48:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> to answe question yes
[22:48:48] <grafi> lol^^
[22:48:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> im using button tags
[22:48:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> to normalize
[22:49:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> and yes that vine always makes me laught
[22:49:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> *laugh
[22:49:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i have a big
[22:49:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> questino for you
[22:49:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> its life and death of our framework
[22:49:54] <grafi> i dont want to marry you
[22:49:55] <grafi> :o
[22:49:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: this is super important
[22:50:02] <grafi> !important ?
[22:50:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> do
[22:50:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> we want
[22:50:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> [epic drum roll]
[22:50:19] <grafi> a logo
[22:50:22] <grafi> a pet tiger
[22:50:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> rounded corners or not
[22:50:26] <grafi> a pony
[22:50:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> or our elements
[22:50:49] <grafi> ima say im over rounded corners
[22:50:51] <grafi> :P
[22:51:02] <grafi> as soon as border-radius was introduced
[22:51:03] <grafi> xD
[22:51:25] <grafi> i liked rounded corners when you still hat to hack that in
[22:51:25] <grafi> xD
[22:52:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[22:52:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> so no rounded corners?
[22:52:36] <grafi> if you really want to
[22:53:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> if its not necessary i want to avoid
[22:53:04] <grafi> but i like edges
[22:53:05] <grafi> :)
[22:53:13] <javalover> quick question
[22:53:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> rounded corners are dont
[22:53:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> done
[22:53:22] <abjorn> .
[22:53:22] <javalover> how do you return hmm crap
[22:53:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: no no quick questions
[22:53:27] <abjorn> what.
[22:53:29] <javalover> no i just realized what's wrong
[22:53:39] <javalover> actually I can convert to a function
[22:53:39] <grafi> javalover glad we could help
[22:53:40] <grafi> :p
[22:53:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> and that is why i dont like quick questios
[22:53:43] <javalover> i'm good nevermind lemme explain though
[22:53:56] <grafi> EXTERMINATE
[22:54:18] <javalover> I had 2 php docs & i use jquery to load one, the second php is a different function all together & I was combining them & i'm like "how do I .load() and return php vars"
[22:54:33] <javalover> then I realized, you don't, you include the php file in your other php file
[22:54:34] <javalover> lol
[22:54:40] <grafi> oO
[22:54:42] <grafi> Oo
[22:56:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: does box shadow require vendor prefixes
[22:56:19] <grafi> god i hope not
[22:56:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i too am confused by javalover's question, to be honest i think he should stick to loving java :P
[22:56:41] <grafi> caniuse say no
[22:56:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[22:56:56] <grafi> but hes loving php right now
[22:56:57] <grafi> :X
[22:57:16] <javalover> the question is probably really confusing
[22:57:21] <javalover> as it's not a proper question
[22:57:35] <javalover> the solution itself proves the question is like asking 2 + 2 why does it equal 5
[22:57:39] <javalover> it doesnt, it equals 4
[22:57:55] <grafi> your not making things better
[22:57:56] <grafi> ^^
[22:58:03] <grafi> *youre
[22:58:06] <javalover> you're* lol
[22:58:13] <grafi> #first
[22:58:17] <javalover> #second
[23:00:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> java lover is grammatically correct
[23:00:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> unfortunately he lst the arguement
[23:00:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi see my latest repo push
[23:00:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> done
[23:00:58] <grafi> im not seeing anything oô
[23:01:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> check again
[23:01:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> i just pushed the primary and secondary button styling

[23:03:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> how the buttons look
[23:03:14] <grafi> but the client is still lightyears ahead
[23:03:14] <grafi> :P
[23:03:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> active staes enabled btw
[23:03:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya the client chagnes the way we think of repos as cmd/terminal only
[23:03:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> now everyone can use them
[23:04:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i think button styling needs to change
[23:04:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: i hope no hard feelings
[23:04:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> im just joking around
[23:04:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> m a java man myself
[23:04:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[23:05:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: what you think of buttons?
[23:06:05] <grafi> well its a start :p
[23:10:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think it needs to be styled difently
[23:10:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmm
[23:11:02] <grafi> we're gonna get there
[23:11:04] <grafi> ;)
[23:11:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> i still think we should have priamry color
[23:11:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> but we cant decide
[23:13:18] <raj> why is returning false at the end of eventhandlers a good idea?
[23:14:16] <grafi> its not
[23:14:19] <grafi> dont do it
[23:14:24] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui yeah maybe
[23:14:30] <grafi> or probably even
[23:16:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: im not feeling a particular color more than another
[23:17:16] <grafi> well we dont have to decide right now :)
[23:17:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> i rather
[23:17:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> so we can get started on more improtant things
[23:17:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> ocne we lay this stuff out
[23:17:59] <grafi> i mean then just pick one
[23:17:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> we can think of everything else
[23:18:05] <grafi> its not like it would be hard to change?
[23:18:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> plus small details matter
[23:18:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> tru
[23:18:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dunno im not diggin the box shadow on bottom

[23:46:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> so for exmaple
