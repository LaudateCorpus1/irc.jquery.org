[05:37:56] <TiffanyAmber> Hello, I have an $.ajax call that returns a random hex color from an API (URL). how can I call it for each one of my .items ?
[05:38:37] <TiffanyAmber> I'm trying to do foreach but it brings all the same hex (it calls the API only once and passes that to all the values)
[05:39:12] <Cork> TiffanyAmber: you need to do a recursive function
[05:39:48] <TiffanyAmber> mmmm I'll read on that, do you have an easy example though? (i'm really noob) ;-D
[05:40:40] <Cork> (function next(i) { if(items[i] { $.ajax(url, { data: { id: items[i].id } }).done(function(data) { items[i].hex = data; next(++i); }); } })(0)
[05:41:03] <Cork> psudo code, but you should get the idea
[05:43:14] <TiffanyAmber> ohhhh
[05:43:25] <TiffanyAmber> thxxxx
[07:10:13] <rizonz> hi guys, anyone using the blueimp fileuploader ? all works fine but what does not is that the progressbar from the uploaded file stay green and "running"
[07:10:16] <rizonz> file is uploaded OK
[09:08:49] <Gotham25> Hi. I need to handle multiple response received for a single Ajax call. Does the callbacks(success and failure) assigned to the Ajax request is capable of catching multiple responses ?
[09:09:35] <Cork> Gotham25: are you talking about chunked responses?
[09:10:02] <Cork> cause it isn't valid to send multiple responses to a http request
[14:15:10] <TiffanyAmber> hello, I'm trying to do an api call that returns a random hex, then populate some divs with it that hex value. The thing is, I want to do a different hex for each div (recursive ajax call) but I can't seem to figure it out! Some help?   https://jsbin.com/nafeveyare/edit?html,js,console
[14:23:35] <taplar> alright so a couple things with this jump out at me
[14:24:00] <taplar> $(".icon-eye").text(resultData); is going to change every element it matches
[14:24:08] <taplar> rather than each in turn
[14:24:39] <taplar> secondly, ajax is asynchronous, so it doesn't "return" the response.  it's expected that you get the response and process it in one of the callbacks.
[14:25:13] <taplar> @ TiffanyAmber
[14:29:03] <TiffanyAmber> taplar: arrghhh! almost thereeee! >> https://jsbin.com/nafeveyare/edit?html,js,console
[14:30:12] <TiffanyAmber> if I console.log, it shows me the two separate strings of numbers, but if I try to format it inside the .icon-eye element, it shows added all in one string
[14:30:41] <TiffanyAmber> the .text(resultData) is going to change every element, that's the desired result
[14:30:45] <taplar> yep, look up above at what i said about the changing every element
[14:30:51] <TiffanyAmber> I want it to show, one hex per element
[14:31:02] <taplar> so you don't want to change every element
[14:31:20] <TiffanyAmber> not following you there
[14:31:34] <taplar> i'm assuming you want one request per element, which should have the result for it's related request, yes?
[14:31:37] <TiffanyAmber> <div hex="3939"> <div hex="2020"> <<< I mean like that
[14:31:55] <TiffanyAmber> one request per element, exactly
[14:32:11] <taplar> ok, so you are doing $('.icon-eye').append(resultData);
[14:32:18] <taplar> which will append to all matched elements
[14:32:27] <TiffanyAmber> dang
[14:32:54] <TiffanyAmber> how can I append it one per element (one request per element) instead of just all the elements? Already tried a foreach
[14:33:08] <taplar> one quick way with the setup you have, is to pass the element into the call method
[14:33:11] <taplar> and append just to it
[14:33:22] <TiffanyAmber> $('.icon-eye').each(function(i) { 		call(); 	    $(".icon-eye").text(resultData); 	});
[14:33:31] <taplar> no
[14:33:35] <taplar> call(this);
[14:33:50] <taplar> and then your call method changes to accept it in as an argument, and uses it for the append
[14:34:18] <TiffanyAmber> how do I that call?
[14:34:30] <taplar> you just add it, just like that
[14:34:33] <taplar> call(this);
[14:34:50] <taplar> and then your method is something like; function call(iconEye) {
[14:34:59] <taplar> and then you append to your iconEye
[14:36:45] <TiffanyAmber> let me see if I get you straight
[14:37:39] <TiffanyAmber> oh, it went on a very wild loop
[14:39:09] <taplar> also this is not valid json: '{"reading"}'
[14:39:43] <Gh0st_Preacher> :)
[14:39:44] <TiffanyAmber> no, I'm screwing it out
[14:40:04] <taplar> uhhh, what?
[14:40:14] <taplar> stubbing it out?
[14:40:26] <TiffanyAmber> you meant like that?
[14:40:31] <TiffanyAmber> function iconEye() {  $('.icon-eye').each(function(){	 	call();  });  }
[14:40:36] <taplar> no
[14:40:43] <taplar> no, you don't rename the method
[14:40:51] <taplar> are you familiar with functions in javascript?
[14:41:18] <TiffanyAmber> somewhat, yes (although not very advanced, I'm a noob in all this ;-D but a girl has to start somewhere)
[14:41:28] <taplar> ok, so the basics
[14:41:28] <TiffanyAmber> I've been reading but I got tired of it and wanted to jump in and start
[14:41:45] <taplar> when you make a method you can pass it arguments, but you should name them so they are easy to reference.  such as
[14:41:56] <taplar> function sayMyName (me) { console.log(me); }
[14:42:13] <grapheti> WHEN NO ONE IS AROUND YOU
[14:42:18] <taplar> The method name is "sayMyName" and it expects one argument to be given, "me"
[14:42:37] <taplar> so if you wanted to call this method you would do something like; dayMyName('Dave')
[14:42:42] <taplar> understand?
[14:42:52] <taplar> minus the typo on the function name
[14:43:06] <taplar> sayMyName('Dave')
[14:44:12] <taplar> got it?
[14:44:19] <TiffanyAmber> yes that part I get pretty well
[14:44:31] <taplar> ok, so now when you do some logic like an each
[14:44:45] <taplar> $(selector).each(function(){ ...stuff... });
[14:45:03] <taplar> inside that function with the stuff, jQuery will make "this" be each element that is being iterated over
[14:45:28] <taplar> so in your case the "this" will reference a single icon eye for each iteration
[14:45:35] <taplar> good?
[14:45:45] <TiffanyAmber> that's the part where I am stuck
[14:45:57] <TiffanyAmber> I try with the selector name (.icon-eye)
[14:46:05] <taplar> but you don't want to
[14:46:14] <taplar> because you already have them, and you want to process them one at a time
[14:46:18] <TiffanyAmber> but it just keeps adding all the numbers instead of doing one per selector
[14:46:26] <taplar> so hold on
[14:46:43] <taplar> $('.icon-eye').each(function () { .... });
[14:46:54] <taplar> inside that each, "this" will be each one of your icon eye in turn
[14:46:59] <TiffanyAmber> exactly, that's the part I'm stuck at
[14:47:17] <TiffanyAmber> wait
[14:47:24] <TiffanyAmber> isn't it taking each from the selector?
[14:47:44] <taplar> each() is just an iterator
[14:47:46] <TiffanyAmber> $('.icon-eye').each(function(){	 <<  icon-eye > each?
[14:47:48] <taplar> like a for loop, logically
[14:48:30] <taplar> so if you did $('.icon-eye').each(function(){ console.log(this); }); you would see it print out the elements one at a time in the console
[14:48:57] <TiffanyAmber> let me try it out
[14:49:09] <grapheti> I wish I had icons for eyes.
[14:49:51] <taplar> what icon though?
[14:49:52] <TiffanyAmber> yes, that's right
[14:50:06] <TiffanyAmber> cloud icon
[14:50:12] <TiffanyAmber> so you could see the sky and all its in it
[14:50:23] <grapheti> prolly this one ðŸ’©
[14:50:31] <TiffanyAmber> ;-(
[14:50:38] <grapheti> then tell everyone my eyes are really pink
[14:50:47] <TiffanyAmber> okay so it prints each .icon-eye
[14:50:52] <TiffanyAmber> but how do I append to each?
[14:51:02] <taplar> alright, so now think back on how functions work
[14:51:16] <taplar> inside that each you are executing call(), which calls the ajax
[14:51:31] <taplar> you can pass that icon eye to it, so it knows which one to work with
[14:52:24] <TiffanyAmber> $('.icon-eye').each(function(){	 $('.icon-eye').text(resultData);  }); doesn't returns anything
[14:52:40] <taplar> 1) there is no function call there.  2) your doing the lookup again
[14:53:02] <taplar> all you have to do is pass the icon eye to the method
[14:53:17] <TiffanyAmber> $('.icon-eye').each(function(){	 	call();  $(this).text(resultData);  });
[14:53:31] <taplar> call(this);  and remove the text part
[14:54:19] <TiffanyAmber> but it doesn't appends if I do
[14:54:26] <taplar> cause we're not done yet, lol
[14:54:29] <TiffanyAmber> $('.icon-eye').each(function(){	 	call(this);    }); <<< doesn't do nothing really to the html
[14:54:33] <taplar> right
[14:54:39] <taplar> cause that's not your whole problem
[14:55:01] <taplar> now you have to change your call function to accept it in and use it
[14:56:27] <TiffanyAmber> mmmmm but I'm passing .icon-eye as a name
[14:56:38] <taplar> what do you mean?
[14:57:16] <TiffanyAmber> call(this); will send .icon-eye
[14:57:17] <TiffanyAmber> right?
[14:57:20] <robertmaxrees> it'
[14:57:24] <taplar> it will send a dom element
[14:57:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:57:28] <taplar> which has that class, yes
[14:58:14] <TiffanyAmber> mmmm that's the thing, I get all the data appended at once
[14:58:16] <TiffanyAmber> like this
[14:58:53] <TiffanyAmber> instead of <div hex=12"> <div hex="50">           I get <div hex="1250"> <div hex="1250">
[14:59:03] <robertmaxrees> show us what your code looks like?
[14:59:08] <TiffanyAmber> (the hex is first 12, then 50)
[14:59:09] <taplar> right, so did you change call to use the element that you are passing to it now?
[14:59:40] <TiffanyAmber> https://jsbin.com/nafeveyare/1/edit?html,js,console
[14:59:46] <TiffanyAmber> dang
[14:59:57] <taplar> so no, :)
[15:00:00] <TiffanyAmber> https://jsbin.com/nafeveyare/1/edit?html,js,console
[15:00:03] <TiffanyAmber> tha one
[15:00:11] <taplar> that's the same link?
[15:00:25] <robertmaxrees> you don'
[15:00:32] <TiffanyAmber> oh right, it reloaded
[15:00:36] <TiffanyAmber> same link yes
[15:00:38] <robertmaxrees> *don't have jsbin open in multiple tabs, right?
[15:01:05] <TiffanyAmber> no no, it reloaded
[15:01:45] <taplar> i don't see any changes with that link
[15:01:49] <TiffanyAmber> oh yes, I had iot ipened in multiples tabs
[15:01:51] <TiffanyAmber> https://jsbin.com/nafeveyare/edit?html,js,console
[15:02:04] <TiffanyAmber> that one is the one I'm working on (lol)
[15:02:08] <taplar> same thing
[15:02:21] <TiffanyAmber> you can see I'm doing $('.icon-eye').append(resultData);	
[15:02:35] <taplar> which is not what we've been talking about
[15:02:36] <TiffanyAmber> $('.icon-eye').each(function(){	 	call(this);  });
[15:02:44] <taplar> yeah i don't see that in that last link
[15:03:18] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/JUAXuFD.png taplar this is what i'm seeing
[15:03:39] <taplar> yeah i don't see that.  wtf
[15:03:48] <robertmaxrees> jsbin :(
[15:03:58] <TiffanyAmber> https://jsbin.com/cemofizeju/edit?html,js,console
[15:04:19] <taplar> there we go
[15:04:28] <TiffanyAmber> lol sorry
[15:04:33] <TiffanyAmber> see the call there?
[15:04:43] <taplar> alright.  so you are doing call(this), but now you have to change your call function to accept it as an argument
[15:05:19] <taplar> function call(aNameForTheVariable)
[15:05:51] <TiffanyAmber> '.icon-eye' ??
[15:05:59] <taplar> no, that's the selector
[15:06:00] <TiffanyAmber> can that be the name of that variable? is the selector
[15:06:05] <TiffanyAmber> right
[15:06:08] <taplar> just a friendly name for it that tells you what it is
[15:06:27] <TiffanyAmber> say iconEye
[15:06:32] <taplar> sure
[15:07:03] <taplar> and then use $(iconEye) in your method instead of looking up '.icon-eye' again
[15:07:30] <pressword> hi
[15:07:39] <pressword> is there a nice jquery ui time picker component?
[15:07:45] <pressword> I want a time picker ,separate to datepicker :)
[15:07:49] <pressword> as fallback
[15:07:49] <TiffanyAmber> how do I append to it?
[15:07:50] <pressword> well
[15:08:04] <taplar> $('.icon-eye').append(resultData);  <---
[15:08:18] <taplar> swap out the lookup with the variable you are passing in
[15:08:28] <TiffanyAmber> oh dang, sorry, I got dizzy with all that
[15:08:42] <TiffanyAmber> did ti before you came back to me, jfyi
[15:08:48] <TiffanyAmber> THANK YOu
[15:08:55] <taplar> got it?
[15:09:21] <TiffanyAmber> it was REALLY hard to me. My bosses told me I should learn some JS and I'm trying to practice ;-( but I got really TIRED of reading all the docs
[15:09:32] <TiffanyAmber> wanted to play around, now I understand functions pretty well ;-D
[15:09:34] <taplar> so do you understand what we are doing now?
[15:09:53] <TiffanyAmber> everything but the swap out of the lookup
[15:10:05] <TiffanyAmber> what youmean? like end the loop or something?
[15:10:12] <taplar> ok, so remember, $(selector) will find all things that match that selector
[15:10:17] <taplar> but we don't want that
[15:10:21] <taplar> we want to change just one thing
[15:10:27] <taplar> which we already have.  right?
[15:12:41] <TiffanyAmber> why?
[15:12:50] <taplar> cause that's what you said you wanted, lol
[15:13:11] <taplar> "I want each thing to be a different hex"
[15:13:24] <taplar> if you select them all, and change them all, they are not different
[15:13:26] <TiffanyAmber> is doing that already
[15:13:26] <taplar> right?
[15:14:14] <TiffanyAmber> I updated the code
[15:14:30] <taplar> i'm trying to explain to you the part you said you don't understand
[15:14:36] <taplar> not suggest a change
[15:15:02] <TiffanyAmber> ohghhhhhh
[15:15:09] <TiffanyAmber> lolol
[15:16:18] <TiffanyAmber> it all makes sense to me, NOW, but not before, obviously. The only thing that's still difficult is the $(iconEye).append and function(iconEye) that part
[15:16:29] <TiffanyAmber> it really confuses me
[15:16:40] <taplar> that's the part that i'm trying to explain
[15:16:59] <pressword> jquery timepicker? :)
[15:17:03] <pressword> what is a good one that has been updated recently?
[15:17:41] <taplar> pressword: there is a datetimepicker plugin i believe.  not sure how recently it's been updated though
[15:19:02] <pressword> taplar: in this case I want a separate timepicker field
[15:19:08] <pressword> just for picking the time
[15:19:09] <pressword> :)
[15:19:15] <taplar> iirc it has the ability to do just time
[15:19:53] <taplar> https://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/
[15:19:57] <taplar> yeah, the TimePicker part
[15:22:04] <pressword> taplar: this looks nice https://github.com/jonthornton/jquery-timepicker
[15:25:12] <TiffanyAmber> taplar https://res.cloudinary.com/prestige-gifting/image/fetch/fl_progressive,q_95,e_sharpen:50,w_480/e_saturation:05/https://www.prestigeflowers.co.uk/images/NF4016-130116.jpg
[15:26:17] <taplar> :)
[15:26:34] <taplar> are you still confused by the append change?
[15:27:11] <TiffanyAmber> I'm starting to suspect I will be for the rest of my lif
[15:27:15] <TiffanyAmber> I'm just saying thanks
[15:27:16] <TiffanyAmber> thanks ;-D
[15:27:30] <TiffanyAmber> gotta run, will come back for sure to learn more
[15:27:32] <TiffanyAmber> gotta studdy
[15:27:43] <taplar> alright, gl with the studies
[15:28:56] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[15:29:01] <grapheti> 2 weeks later - http://i.imgur.com/AGcuIG5.jpg
[15:29:25] <taplar> aww
[15:29:44] <grapheti> lol
[15:29:47] <taplar> i feel like you've been hurt in life grapheti
[15:29:49] <taplar> :P
[15:29:55] <grapheti> I was gonna say something really horrible, but stopped. :P
[15:30:08] <grapheti> Cause it's a damn help chan.
[15:31:25] <grapheti> Yeah, these hemorrhoids really do a toll on me.
[15:31:30] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[15:31:37] <grapheti> lol
[16:23:01] <taplar> i found out it's fairly hard to recycle a television saturday
[16:23:33] <taplar> bestbuy tried to charge me $100 :s
[16:25:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah... it can be a pain.
[16:34:03] <robertmaxrees> cfl bulbs are another example.
[16:35:15] <taplar> you have to do something special with those?
[16:35:59] <robertmaxrees> yep.  they have mercury in them.
[16:38:23] <taplar> mmm, now you got me wanting to check when i get home, but i think we're using leds now
[16:39:18] <grapheti> that's why I see these on craiglist for free
[16:39:25] <grapheti> cragslist*
[16:39:31] <grapheti> craigslist* :P
[16:40:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  it's only like 4 mg per bulb but those add up.  mercury is crazy toxi.
[16:40:25] <robertmaxrees> *toxic
[16:41:25] <grapheti> It's like the brilliant idea to use lead pipes in Flint, MI.
[16:41:43] <grapheti> GO ENGINEERING!
[16:42:04] <taplar> that's probably more of a contractor thing
[16:43:23] <robertmaxrees> also: more complex than that ;)
[16:43:45] <grapheti> true
[16:45:17] <grapheti> dat depletion
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> the issue didn't rear its head until after they swapped water source.  lake huron's (iirc) water is more corrosive than detroit's, which meant that the years of buildup in the lead pipes was quickly corroded away and the raw lead was exposed.
[16:48:07] <robertmaxrees> also: the word "plumbing" comes from the latin word for "lead" - plumbum
[16:48:32] <grapheti> lol
[16:49:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:49:05] <grapheti> The days of leaded gas.
[16:49:08] <grapheti> Those were the days.
[16:52:29] <grapheti> I mean my car functions extremely well. What's wrong with a little brain impairment?
[16:53:47] <taplar> ok, i'm going to get a little morbid with this
[16:53:56] <grapheti> lol
[16:54:04] <taplar> i wonder how much britta ads spiked in flint during that time
[16:56:01] <grapheti> the golden commodity
[19:18:09] <EddieD> I'm messing with this -> https://jsfiddle.net/arre8k9n/2/ . I can't get it to srt the list as I type. It shows all the results, no matter what I type. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks a lot :)
[19:18:16] <EddieD> *srt = sort
[19:21:48] <robertmaxrees> EddieD well yeah.
[19:21:53] <robertmaxrees> you're not doing anything server-side there.
[19:26:04] <robertmaxrees> EddieD "The Autocomplete plugin does not filter the results, instead a query string is added with a term field, which the server-side script should use for filtering the results."
[19:31:50] <EddieD> Oooh I see. And what's the name of the query string? robertmaxrees (and thanks)
[19:32:33] <EddieD> Damn
[19:32:38] <EddieD> "Term" is the name of the field xD
[19:32:47] <EddieD> Sorry, the lack of coffee... Thanks again robertmaxrees
[19:40:06] <robertmaxrees> :) All good
[22:05:25] <jpp`> hi, I have a jQuery question
[22:06:04] <jpp`> I have a page that builds a table when a button is clicked.  Once created, I want the boxes of the table to change color once they are clicked.  So from white to red, or whatever color.
[22:06:21] <jpp`> I have created a function, but am not getting any response, and I have no idea why.
[22:06:46] <jpp`> ie, when I click the element, nothing happens, not even a message to the console.
[22:06:55] <jpp`> any suggestions would be appreciated!
[22:08:14] <shoky> jpp`: make a jsfiddle demonstrating the issue ( https://jsfiddle.net )
[22:14:22] <kunal>        var action_str = action == 'delete' ? 'deleted':(action == 'deactivate' ? 'deactivated':'activated');
[22:14:34] <kunal> can some one translate this into normal if then else structture
[22:14:36] <kunal> pls
[22:17:28] <kunal> heellooo
[22:17:32] <pavonia> x = b ? t : f === if (b) then x = t; else x = f;
[22:17:50] <pavonia> Err -then :D
[22:18:08] <kunal> if(){ }else{ }
[22:18:18] <kunal> can u transalate it like that
[22:18:33] <pavonia> I just gave the general pattern
[22:18:33] <kunal> var action_str = action == 'delete' ? 'deleted':(action == 'deactivate' ? 'deactivated':'activated');
[22:19:15] <pavonia> Again with braces: x = b ? t : f === if (b) { x = t; } else { x = f; }
[22:19:47] <kunal> -_-
[22:20:06] <pavonia> What part is unclear?
[22:20:20] <kunal> see mine

[22:36:11] <kunal> any one heard of icumulus?
[23:01:00] <devi8> kunal, do you mean if (action=='delete') action_str='deleted'; else if (action=='deactivate') action_str='deactivated'; else action_str="activated";   or something like that?
[23:01:41] <devi8> I didn't add the exact syntax, but is that what you are looking for?
[23:05:55] <devi8> Another way might be: var strlist={delete:"deleted", deactive:"deactivated",other:"activated"}; var action_str=strlist[action]||"activated";
