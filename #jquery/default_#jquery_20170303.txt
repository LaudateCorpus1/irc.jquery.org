[00:13:49] <jsharpminor> I'm trying to update some data tags on some <td>s when I move them around using jquery-ui. I have code that is supposed to do just that. The code executes, but the tags don't update.
[00:13:50] <jsharpminor> http://jsbin.com/culada/edit?html,css,output
[00:30:35] <WhirledPress> jsharpminor, that's a lot of code to debug. Can you explain more?
[00:42:16] <WhirledPress> jsharpminor, in your code where it says $(thingToFill.).children().last().data("pos") you are getting undefined because thingToFill.data("pos") is the data on the td element, not the paragraph inside it.
[00:42:25] <tuskkk___> Hello, I am generating the html using this code -  https://jsfiddle.net/wpc40ukf/, the key gives me the name of a source, say "Test Source" but when I am putting that into title, I only see "Test". Why is that?
[00:42:57] <jsharpminor> WhirledPress : Oh, thanks, I'll look at that
[00:43:47] <WhirledPress> jsharpminor, also you are passing a jquery object (contianing a TD element), so there's no need to use $(thingToFIll), just use thingToFill
[00:45:17] <WhirledPress> tuskkk___, try using something like title='"+key+"'
[00:45:53] <WhirledPress> without it the html rendered looks like title=Hey there   but the space makes it think it's another attribute
[00:46:14] <WhirledPress> where as title='Hey there' should use the entire string.
[00:46:49] <tuskkk___> WhirledPress: worked, thanks!
[01:06:24] <WhirledPress> Anybody know how to fire a trigger event and pass a variable?
[01:26:16] <Cork> WhirledPress: you can add a second argument to .trigger()
[01:26:26] <Cork> it will be added to the event object
[01:29:23] <WhirledPress> I just figured out that you have to add it as an array...I guess. it works if I use an array
[01:31:18] <Cork> ya, else you could only provide one
[04:19:12] <Noor_egy> hello i'm using            TouchSwipe plugin with my phonegap app but the swip action not run on the emulator
[04:40:23] <_hassoon_> 'morning
[05:16:06] <nocturnally> hi all
[05:16:54] <bahamas> hello. I'm trying to get the Location header of a response, but I get null. anyone know how I can retrieve the location? I'm using jqXHR.getResponseHeader('Location')
[05:18:26] <nocturnally> i'm trying to auto complete cities via jquery
[05:18:34] <nocturnally> https://bpaste.net/show/6488eb32f610
[05:18:47] <Woet> anyone know why this weird rounding issue is happening? https://jsfiddle.net/g8gn4hvz/ - just move the slider and you'll see the .000000001 values
[05:18:54] <Woet> only happens if min is 1, if its 0 its fine
[05:19:04] <nocturnally> it works well outside of /var/www  but doesnot autocomple inside the server root
[05:20:05] <nocturnally> * does not autocomplete when called from inside the server root
[05:20:36] <Woet> nocturnally: did you change the paths accordingly?
[05:20:47] <Woet> nocturnally: did you check the console?
[05:21:20] <nocturnally> the paths are ok
[05:21:30] <nocturnally> do you mena browser console?
[05:21:35] <nocturnally> *mean
[05:22:45] <Woet> nocturnally: right click -> inspect element -> console at the bottom
[05:24:56] <nocturnally> Woet: thanks, it says this service requires an API- key
[05:27:08] <Woet> nocturnally: now you know
[05:43:00] <xarvis> Hi all.
[05:43:12] <xarvis> Has anyone used tinymce plugin for visual editors?
[05:48:55] <nocturnally> still dosent work from my local web server
[05:49:22] <nocturnally> and doesnto throw any error in console
[05:50:46] <nocturnally> https://bpaste.net/show/6488eb32f610
[05:50:52] <nocturnally> plz have a look
[05:51:11] <nocturnally> it works when opened as a file in the browser
[05:58:10] <Cork> nocturnally: 1. don't put tag names infront of ids
[05:58:31] <Cork> 1. link isn't valid in body
[05:58:38] <Cork> opps * 2.
[06:00:09] <Cork> 3. make sure jquery.city-autocomplete.js and city-autocomplete.css is positioned directly on the same url parent as the current url
[06:00:52] <Cork> so if you go to http://www.example.com/path/to/view the css and js needs to be http://www.example.com/path/to/view/ + city-autocomplete.css and jqueyr.city-autocomplete.js
[06:01:33] <Cork> file access works a bit differently in browsers so i recommend you to always run a local webserver
[06:01:50] <Cork> there are some really easy servers you can use (one of my favorite is caddy)
[06:01:55] <nocturnally> i'm running local server
[06:02:07] <Cork> then don't ever test on file level
[06:02:14] <nocturnally> it works fine as a file but fails when called from the localhost
[06:02:24] <nocturnally> i've checkd all the points
[06:02:48] <Cork> btw i would recommend running what you have through w3cs html validator
[06:02:48] <nocturnally> it asked me for a key on console
[06:03:08] <Cork> cause the html isn't valid by quite a bit
[06:16:00] <nocturnally> Cork: thanks, the API key was not enabled . fiex the issue
[06:23:34] <ctmarco> ANyone working with jQueryForm plugin here?
[06:26:55] <Woet> anyone know why this weird rounding issue is happening? https://jsfiddle.net/g8gn4hvz/ - just move the slider and you'll see the .000000001 values, happens with min at 1, min at 0 is fine
[06:43:11] <Cork> Woet: javascript doesn't have ints it has so all values are stored with floating numbers
[06:43:21] <Cork> what you see there is a common floating number error
[06:43:30] <Cork> just round the value and the problem goes away
[06:43:37] <Cork> Math.floor() for example
[06:44:07] <Woet> right, okay. thanks
[08:18:27] <codecutter> is there a way to do something like $(document).trigger('foo'), function(){val: $('.foo').text()}? without send the entire function?
[08:18:32] <codecutter> sending*
[08:45:40] <codecutter> anyone?
[09:00:13] <MikeD_> Bueler?
[09:00:25] <MikeD_> i didn't see the question
[09:07:14] <Cork> codecutter: function(){val: $('.foo').text()} isn't even valid code, so what exactly are you trying to do?
[09:07:39] <codecutter> i know
[09:07:57] <codecutter> i'm trying to send a variable over to the listener
[09:08:50] <Cork> i would prob recommend grabbing the value in the event handler
[09:08:58] <Cork> as normal events won't give you that value
[09:09:20] <Cork> and if you plan to trigger the event by code every time, it shouldn't be an event handler to begin with
[09:09:43] <codecutter> i can always do this: var someVar = $('foo').text();.... this.trigger('event', {foo: someVar}), is there a way to get 'someVar' inside the trigger before sending it over?
[09:10:06] <MikeD_> our team has built so much code in event handlers... it's a mess
[09:10:48] <Cork> codecutter: either select it in the event handler or, no, you have to pass it as extra parameters to the handler
[09:11:19] <codecutter> yes, thought that would be the case
[09:11:36] <MikeD_> why wouldn't you have the handler do the lookup itself?
[09:11:39] <Cork> well, there is a third option to have the selected element as a inherited scrope and select from that
[09:11:47] <Cork> ya, my question too
[09:11:56] <codecutter> MikeD_: can i see an example?
[09:11:58] <Cork> as none fake events won't ever work with this solution
[09:12:24] <Cork> codecutter: .on('event', function() { var someVar = $('foo').text() })
[09:12:53] <codecutter> ah!
[09:13:13] <Cork> its how you need to do it if you want it to actually work so...
[09:13:25] <codecutter> that wont be possible because I am calling trig inside another function
[09:13:40] <Cork> and why does that matter=
[09:13:42] <Cork> *?
[09:14:29] <MikeD_> i'm guessing you don't have a clear picture of how all your code is meant to work and you're hacking at it
[09:15:11] <Cork> or your using events as an api to make calls between project parts
[09:15:26] <MikeD_> for some small edits that's a valid approach, but it's not sustainable and you'll end up shooting yourself in the foot
[09:15:44] <Cork> actually it is very rarely valid
[09:15:47] <codecutter> Cork: spot n
[09:15:51] <codecutter> i'm using flight
[09:15:54] <Cork> as it makes things much slower then it needs to be
[09:15:58] <codecutter> which is event drivern
[09:16:16] <Cork> codecutter: and the events you call are pure fake events?
[09:16:28] <codecutter> look up flight
[09:16:28] <Cork> like on('flight-click')
[09:16:52] <Cork> doesn't sound like i care, wouldn't ever use it
[09:17:20] <Cork> i wouldn't touch libs using that kind of apis with a ten foot pole
[09:17:42] <MikeD_> and your difficulty with it already makes me wary of it
[09:17:59] <codecutter> wel, the application i'm working on has twitter like features, which is one of the reason i chose flight in the first place
[09:18:10] <codecutter> well*
[09:18:46] <codecutter> which made sense at the time
[09:18:46] <Cork> codecutter: that is fine, but if an event can only ever be executed through .trigger, cause it has to pass extra parameters it won't have as a normal event
[09:18:49] <Cork> it is just pure broken
[09:19:31] <MikeD_> 99.44% pure
[09:20:42] <codecutter> it seems to work for me, although you may be a point on speed. I am beginning to notice this
[09:20:48] <codecutter> may have a*
[09:20:59] <Cork> there are more reasons then that
[09:21:17] <Cork> what users are to expect from an event is violated
[09:21:24] <codecutter> other than it seems to work just fine
[09:21:26] <Cork> so it isn't really events
[09:21:35] <codecutter> than that*
[09:21:37] <decx> do you really need trigger?
[09:21:40] <Cork> and then it shouldn't be an event to start with
[09:21:42] <codecutter> yes
[09:21:49] <decx> most triggers can be dealt with with a normal function and arguments
[09:21:55] <Cork> decx: he uses the second array argument
[09:22:12] <Cork> to pass extra parameters to the callback
[09:22:37] <codecutter> flight has this concept called 'component', a component it as attached to an element in the document. The components communicate with each other throgh events
[09:23:00] <codecutter> thats one of the fundamental concept of flight
[09:23:46] <codecutter> whether this is a good idea or not, i'll leave that up to you guys to decide.
[09:25:17] <codecutter> experts
[09:25:24] <codecutter> of which I am not one
[09:27:12] <codecutter> people like Cork scare me with the grasp of jquery :)
[09:27:18] <codecutter> their*
[09:27:35] <sigdk> Gentlemen, my amazing FAQ does not render html code rendered in db https://jsfiddle.net/d1d5n6qx/43/. I want to store photos,, but what I get on screen is raw html code <img ...>  Any hint?
[09:27:38] <codecutter> i just use it to get shit done :)
[09:28:13] <Cork> codecutter: it is quite simple, i used js for many many years before jquery was a thing
[09:28:28] <codecutter> well, js then
[09:28:30] <Cork> so when i first started using it i read through (the then quite small jquery 1.0)
[09:28:31] <codecutter> ok
[09:28:45] <Cork> and had read through the changes since then
[09:28:53] <Cork> so it isn't THAT special
[09:28:57] <steveccc> I can detect a hover on an svg element when its added to a page as an object but not when its added within an img tag. Is this correct and is there a way around it?
[09:29:23] <codecutter> presumably you would consider yourself a 'client side' developer?
[09:29:59] <Cork> steveccc: img doesn't run scripts in the svg
[09:30:04] <codecutter> people like me, fall on the otherside (sever side)
[09:30:23] <Cork> the svg gets treated like an img format there to not expose sites to remote scripting injections
[09:30:31] <steveccc> cork: the script is outside the svg file
[09:30:49] <Cork> steveccc: then you won't even have a dom to trigger the hover on
[09:31:15] <Cork> img is a replaced element, it doesn't have a dom (at least not use accessable)
[09:31:23] <steveccc> cork: thats what i was wondering - so the svg either needs to be added as an object or the raw svg code pasted into the html file?
[09:31:25] <Cork> use=user
[09:31:37] <Cork> steveccc: or an iframe
[09:31:40] <Cork> but yes
[09:32:05] <Cork> sigdk: where is the img tag created, i can't find it
[09:32:10] <steveccc> cork: ok thanks - its far too slow when its embedded or an object so think i need to rethink my idea :)
[09:32:43] <Cork> steveccc: what part is too slow?
[09:33:12] <decx> just have the hover event on the img
[09:33:18] <steveccc> cork: generally the performance - scrolling etc. Its a map svg that was provided but has far too much detail in my opinion so is far too large
[09:33:39] <Cork> ya, rendering large paths take time
[09:33:40] <steveccc> docx: i have different parts of the map that i want to have hover effects on
[09:34:10] <Cork> though you could make it so you only append the visible part of the svg
[09:34:21] <decx> there's a use tag
[09:34:25] <Cork> i've only ever done that for graphs, but that can be very fast
[09:34:26] <steveccc> they have included things like the fine detail ie all car parking spaces etc and I think it will just need reducing to a carpark general area which will cut own the svg size
[09:34:30] <decx> where you can inline events
[09:34:52] <Cork> steveccc: ya, that sounds about right
[09:35:14] <Cork> hmm, though you could try setting parts as display: none
[09:35:25] <Cork> as that means the browser won't actually render it
[09:35:34] <Cork> that MIGHT make a performance difference for you
[09:35:48] <steveccc> cork: so is the slowness down to the amount of elements rather than raw filesize of the svg?
[09:35:49] <Cork> sigdk: ?
[09:36:06] <Cork> steveccc: if it is after loading it, then yes
[09:36:30] <NoiseEee> steveccc: you might also want to see what svgo can do with it before putting it into production
[09:36:32] <Cork> dom doesn't like tons of elements
[09:36:55] <NoiseEee> steveccc: https://github.com/svg/svgo || https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/
[09:38:59] <sigdk> Cork, I'll try give an example, let me modify the fiddle
[09:39:10] <ZoderUck> SaraDR_: window.location.pathname otherwise
[09:39:10] <ZoderUck> <ZoderUck> i have a slight json parse error,  maybe you folks do know how t tackle this.  http://i64.tinypic.com/mj6aeo.png
[09:39:18] <ZoderUck> The data is serialized by php code, proberbly something wrong with this json string.
[09:39:46] <Cork> ugg not as an image...
[09:39:56] <ZoderUck> yes exactly as an image
[09:39:58] <ZoderUck> that is what you get
[09:40:25] <Cork> well if tinypic.com image is all i get i pass
[09:40:36] <Cork> too much hassle
[09:41:24] <ZoderUck> Cork, i have also a json stuff but,  ok
[09:41:26] <ZoderUck> wait
[09:41:37] <ZoderUck> the problem is Parse error
[09:41:59] <Cork> the json and the error is what i wold like to get
[09:42:04] <ZoderUck> unexpected token o in json at position 1
[09:42:14] <ZoderUck> can i give you the url that spews  json ?
[09:42:14] <MagnusVortex> are you parsing something that's already parsed?
[09:42:19] <Cork> sure
[09:42:21] <ZoderUck> in the browser client it is ok
[09:42:29] <MagnusVortex> I had the exact same problem a few days ago
[09:42:30] <ZoderUck> http://mart-radio-site.ga/eventsthisday/get-upcomming-events
[09:42:34] <steveccc> noiseEee: sorry to be a pain but is there a way to merge items in an svg to reduce the amount of elements. bit like a graphics package merge layers
[09:42:45] <ZoderUck> yes the probem is there is a prototype in the json object
[09:42:58] <Cork> wait you get i in json file??
[09:43:13] <ZoderUck> i do know if i create an json string with PHP StdClass  and with properties with a clean  Class then the output is fine
[09:43:15] <Cork> sounds like you're trying to load the json as jsonp
[09:43:32] <Cork> opps *get o in json
[09:43:54] <ZoderUck> you need the source code of my javascript ?
[09:44:19] <Cork> if you're sure the json you just gave me is what the script gets, then ya
[09:45:00] <NoiseEee> steveccc: well in graphics software or something sure, but give that svgo a shot at the very least
[09:45:08] <Cork> ZoderUck: i can tell you one thing, this is wrong: Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8
[09:45:30] <Cork> your server is sending html not json so you have to either correct that client side or things will break
[09:45:53] <steveccc> noiseeee: i have thanks - it has reduced it by half but still too slow. Its a map with hundreds of car parking spaces marked so wondered if I could merge all them so that all the detail was the equivalent of one layer rather than individual items
[09:46:17] <Cork> ZoderUck: that line should read Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
[09:47:38] <ZoderUck> uh
[09:48:00] <NoiseEee> steveccc: who/what is producing the SVG should ideally be taking care of that.  otherwise maybe sofware like inkspace or illustrator
[09:48:05] <ZoderUck> ships this is a YII  controler framework
[09:48:14] <ZoderUck> i dont know how to set the header to Json
[09:48:30] <ZoderUck> shoujld i do it with PHP hardcore if possible ?
[09:48:43] <ZoderUck> Cork but is that the cause ?
[09:49:00] <Cork> ZoderUck: before you make any output header('Content-Type: application/json; charcode=UTF-8'); should work
[09:49:37] <Cork> ZoderUck: it is possible to work around this in js, but the server is lying so it is better to fix it there if at all possible
[10:00:51] <ZoderUck> uh ok, let me try wait
[10:04:47] <Mavericks> I came across http://stackoverflow.com/a/13388915/465974
[10:04:52] <Mavericks> I implemented it to test but the source.onmessage doesn't display when I console log the e in the onmessage function
[10:04:56] <Mavericks> what could be the issue ?
[10:05:03] <Mavericks> i'm able to print the data on the terminal as it yields on the server side just fine
[10:06:30] <Cork> Mavericks: you mean if you console.log(e) the data part is missing or what are you saying?
[10:06:31] <ZoderUck> Cork is this better ? view-source:http://mart-radio-site.ga/eventsthisday/get-upcomming-events
[10:06:45] <Cork> ZoderUck: yup!
[10:06:55] <Mavericks> Cork: yes console.log(e) doesn't do/print anything
[10:06:56] <ZoderUck> aha thanks :)
[10:07:03] <ZoderUck> okay lets parse but still the error.
[10:07:11] <ZoderUck> can i give the source code ?
[10:07:17] <Cork> ZoderUck: yup, time to look at the js part
[10:07:26] <Cork> ZoderUck: are you using $.ajax?
[10:07:34] <Cork> or native js?
[10:07:54] <ZoderUck> martEventsGetPresentTodaysEvents.js
[10:08:13] <ZoderUck> it is a simple updater thing,  the goal, maybe it is already there in YII as  component\
[10:08:36] <ZoderUck> below you see the init at document ready
[10:09:18] <Cork> ZoderUck: where am i to find the file?
[10:09:33] <ZoderUck> the file
[10:09:44] <ZoderUck> the file file ?
[10:09:53] <Cork> martEventsGetPresentTodaysEvents.js
[10:10:01] <Cork> if i am to read what you do i need the resource :)
[10:10:13] <ZoderUck> the file is here http://mart-radio-site.ga/dist/js/martEventsGetPresentTodaysEvents.js
[10:10:33] <sigdk> Cork, check the first Q-A https://jsfiddle.net/d1d5n6qx/44/
[10:10:54] <sigdk> Shouldn't the <b>Hello World</b> be rendered to bold?
[10:11:47] <Cork> ZoderUck: dataResponse = JSON.parse(data) <-- this is wrong
[10:11:58] <Cork> your parsing something that is already parsed
[10:12:07] <ZoderUck> oow shouljd that be data.textResponse ?
[10:12:14] <Cork> just use data.blSuccessfull
[10:12:21] <ZoderUck> realy ?
[10:12:23] <Cork> yes
[10:12:33] <ZoderUck> how strange, this code was from an old project
[10:12:46] <Uhkis> sigdk: you need to use html() to get html, text() is just for text
[10:12:53] <Cork> $.getJSON().fail(function() {}) is called if the parsing fails
[10:12:59] <ZoderUck> maybe previous output did  have some {  }  around the data.text that is why i tried  parse json
[10:13:04] <Cork> (you don't currently have it)
[10:13:17] <ZoderUck> ok let met change the code
[10:13:44] <Cork> oops, sorry you DO have it i just missed it
[10:14:31] <sigdk> Uhkis, I am not sure I got it, could you update the fiddle?
[10:14:39] * hlve slaps sigdk with a trout.
[10:14:45] <Cork> heh
[10:14:49] <Uhkis> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/d1d5n6qx/45/
[10:15:11] <Uhkis> sigdk: line #35 changed
[10:16:05] <ZoderUck> Cork, yes it worked thanks very very much
[10:16:12] <Cork> ZoderUck: np
[10:16:17] <ZoderUck> Cork, i was debugging this a whole day.
[10:16:23] <ZoderUck> why is javascript this difficult
[10:16:26] <Cork> ZoderUck: the error you got was cause you tried to decode a javscript object
[10:16:37] <ZoderUck> i mean sometimes i need grep first element sometmes
[10:16:44] <Cork> so JSON.parse('[object object]')
[10:16:51] <ZoderUck> o
[10:16:55] <Cork> and well... that isn't valid json :)
[10:17:13] <ZoderUck> and what if i put in php the jsonstring into  { and }   wrap it ?
[10:17:22] <Cork> shouldn't matter
[10:17:26] <ZoderUck> ow ok
[10:17:29] <ZoderUck> strange ok.
[10:17:35] <Cork> as long as the structure is still valid
[10:17:46] <Cork> and if it isn't you would end up in the .fail handler
[10:17:56] <ZoderUck> Cork, what i try to make here is a   refresh of to browser clientand get the next episode in the planning
[10:18:11] <ZoderUck> so after a delatytime the timer should fire and do next get
[10:18:21] <ZoderUck> that structure, i would like to have input later on.
[10:18:37] <ZoderUck> i use 2 global var timers,   1 timer is for current playing song
[10:18:49] <ZoderUck> and the refresuh is every 2.5 minute, is that a good plan ?
[10:18:59] <Cork> ZoderUck: what are you using to play?
[10:19:00] <ZoderUck> how do i test the browser clientdate  with the server date ?
[10:19:04] <Cork> <audio>?
[10:19:09] <ZoderUck> with incorperating  timezon
[10:19:18] <ZoderUck> i dont want to play audio
[10:19:23] <ZoderUck> the audio is played at the studio
[10:19:35] <ZoderUck> the goal isdisplay title of the song  , refresh automaticly
[10:19:39] <Cork> ah, so this is to control it
[10:19:43] <Cork> interesting
[10:20:06] <ZoderUck> it is just the browser client to get an intelligente fresh :)
[10:20:09] <Cork> well personally i would prob have done thing as a websocket solution
[10:20:17] <ZoderUck> aha ok
[10:20:18] <Cork> where you push out the data instead of pulling it
[10:20:22] <ZoderUck> i am not into websocket YET
[10:20:31] <ZoderUck> but i did hear about websocket yes.
[10:20:43] <ZoderUck> AHA I see, that is much better
[10:20:46] <Cork> that way each user would make a websocket connection as the go to the site
[10:20:55] <ZoderUck> all (most) browser support this right also mobile browsr ?
[10:20:59] <Cork> and as things "change" server side you push out the new info to all listeners
[10:21:05] <Cork> ya
[10:21:11] <Cork> only exception is old ie
[10:21:23] <Cork> i think ie9 or 10 is required
[10:21:37] <Cork> but there are flash fallbacks (and silverlight if i remember correctly)
[10:21:39] <Uhkis> http://caniuse.com/#search=websocket
[10:21:52] <ZoderUck> ahaok
[10:22:12] <sigdk> Uhkis, thank you sir
[10:22:13] <Cork> been using it as a fundamental part of a few sites for several years no
[10:22:15] <ZoderUck> and other point,  now i us iframe  with itune player,  is there a way i could embed the ituner with some javascript
[10:22:16] <Cork> *now
[10:22:25] <ZoderUck> i mean with ja javscript player or other audio player
[10:22:33] <Cork> don't think so
[10:22:39] <ZoderUck> ow ok,  yes ok
[10:22:39] <Cork> they would have to provide an api for that
[10:22:43] <ZoderUck> then i live it this way :)
[10:22:54] <ZoderUck> is there  a way i could manipulate the iframe background image ?
[10:22:57] <ZoderUck> color i mean
[10:23:13] <ZoderUck> difficult right ?
[10:23:16] <Cork> no, it is cross domain
[10:23:22] <Cork> so js has no access
[10:23:23] <ZoderUck> aha i see, i see ok
[10:23:28] <ZoderUck> aha ok, i see.
[10:23:44] <Cork> if you didn't depend on itune there are a ton of ways but...
[10:24:29] <Cork> apple aren't exactly known for liking ppl to use there services as backend features :)
[10:25:38] <Cork> wow google... just wow...
[10:25:47] <Cork> "itune streaming api"
[10:25:49] <Cork> "Did you mean: youtube streaming api"
[10:25:52] <Cork> SIGH...
[10:27:46] <Uhkis> mine says "itunes streaming api"
[10:27:51] <Uhkis> you broke google! :D
[10:29:21] <Cork> anyway off for the weekend
[10:31:01] <AnGe7> hey all
[10:31:24] <AnGe7> someone know one event scheduler / calendar with bootstrap/jquery ?
[10:32:20] <sigdk> so, again on this: https://jsfiddle.net/d1d5n6qx/46/  how can I  "accumulate"  objects and instead of doing multiple target.append() I do only one?
[10:46:19] <SlimmyJimmy> Does anybody know if Seagates "SeaToolsForDos.ISO" can be made to work from a menu off a flash drive created using YUMI? I tried it, and it started to boot but didn't get past a single line of gobbledygook on the screen.
[10:50:43] <Uhkis> you're in the wrong channel for that kind of support, buddy
[10:53:41] <SlimmyJimmy> Thanks sugar, I think your right
[11:00:29] <Chulbul> how to check if difference between two dates is exaclty 1 year in jquery including leap year and non leap year
[11:14:16] <Uhkis> Chulbul: check out moment.js
[11:15:44] <Chulbul> Ok Uhkis
[12:14:42] <realies> how can you make a single page website with jquery?
[12:21:16] <realies> can u detect changes to the hash
[12:25:18] <cjohnson> I doubt it, but is there a method which I can pass either a selector to, or a filter function to, and it will determine which one to apply?
[12:26:00] <robertmaxrees> how would it know whcih to apply?
[12:26:04] <cjohnson> Trying to write a re-usable hunk of code and I want to be able to define the filter method in the config. Need to know if I need to code in a check for if (function) { return foo.filter(function); } else { return foo.is(function); }
[12:26:07] <robertmaxrees> realies https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onhashchange
[12:26:19] <cjohnson> if it's a string, apply as a selector
[12:26:25] <cjohnson> if it's a function, call .filter
[12:26:31] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson filter can take either.
[12:26:36] <cjohnson> ah! brilliant
[12:26:38] <robertmaxrees> like, the one baked into jquery.
[12:27:08] <robertmaxrees> can give it a selector, a function, DOM nodes, or a jQuery object.
[12:27:11] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[12:27:49] <cjohnson> beautiful. thanks as always robertmaxrees
[12:27:54] <cjohnson> just goes to show I should never think before I program
[12:27:58] <robertmaxrees> haha
[12:28:43] <BTM> is there a way to fire a command after objects are rendered, and not just when they are in the html?
[12:29:12] <robertmaxrees> BTM err, you just put your code after you pop them into the page.
[12:29:25] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue you're trying to solve?
[12:30:05] <BTM> Well when I append to my html, they get loaded into the page, but they don't actually render for like 5 seconds
[12:30:14] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:30:21] <robertmaxrees> got some code to show?
[12:30:27] <robertmaxrees> because that sounds like an ajax request is being done.
[12:30:38] <BTM> It's not through ajax, but 1 sec
[12:31:09] <robertmaxrees> the step of putting code into the page and it "rendering" is effectively a synchronous operation, so if it really takes 5 seconds, you've got a big problem.
[12:32:15] <BTM> I was talking about this Taplar yesterday as well. So basically, the div loads my html in
[12:32:26] <BTM> but then the rendering takes the time up
[12:32:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah show some code.
[12:32:34] <BTM> https://jsfiddle.net/du9ee9h0/7/
[12:32:47] <BTM> or actually, use this one: https://jsfiddle.net/du9ee9h0/8/
[12:33:34] <robertmaxrees> how many elements are you pushing in?
[12:33:59] <BTM> It can be anywhere from 1-10
[12:34:07] <robertmaxrees> then there's something else going on.
[12:34:12] <robertmaxrees> can you get this functional?
[12:34:22] <cjohnson> robertmaxrees: hah, even better. .is() supports function and selector as well
[12:34:26] <cjohnson> and .is() is what I had originally
[12:34:29] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson there you go :)
[12:34:34] <BTM> I'll query you a link to it
[12:34:41] <robertmaxrees> BTM
[12:34:41] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:34:44] <robertmaxrees> pls no
[12:34:48] <BTM> ok haha
[12:35:02] <robertmaxrees> heh.  if you can share it with me, you can pop to the channel.  if you don't want the site public, boil down the case into the fiddle.
[12:35:20] <BTM> It's built on my company's cms so I can't recreate some of the stuff in a fiddle
[12:35:29] <robertmaxrees> it's all html and js.
[12:35:35] <robertmaxrees> so there's no reason you cant?
[12:35:51] <BTM> Well the parts that build the array are generated from the cms
[12:35:57] <robertmaxrees> still just data.
[12:36:13] <BTM> ok, let me try something
[12:36:14] <robertmaxrees> looks like a bunch of html you're working with.
[12:36:28] <robertmaxrees> the issue here is that 5 seconds to "render" something seems specious.
[12:47:41] <BTM> I can't get it to 100% act the same way as it does in my example
[12:47:54] <robertmaxrees> BTM what's different in the fiddle?
[12:48:03] <BTM> https://jsfiddle.net/du9ee9h0/12/
[12:48:15] <BTM> the append is not working because it can't find my arrays
[12:48:29] <robertmaxrees> "contentformat[i] "
[12:48:51] <robertmaxrees> looks like you define that within that .each() up aboive.
[12:49:09] <robertmaxrees> where you go over all the .hs_cos_wrapper_widget
[12:49:28] <robertmaxrees> also: have you tried using a profiler on your site to see where the slowdown is?
[12:49:33] <BTM> Yes, but the array itself is created outside the each
[12:49:50] <BTM> yes, it has a good load time, but the render is bad, I'll show you 1 sec
[12:49:52] <robertmaxrees> BTM right, but you populate it inside the each
[12:50:39] <BTM> https://gyazo.com/cba7ecbec995f959b9aa64eb429cf102 this is the load of it on the site
[12:52:01] <robertmaxrees> profiler?
[12:52:06] <BTM> https://gyazo.com/284c17666da879574eb02d3482eaa2e0 And here they are being populated almost instantly
[12:52:24] <BTM> but they don't actually get painted in for 5+secs
[12:52:58] <robertmaxrees> profiler
[12:53:51] <BTM> What part of it do you want?
[12:54:16] <robertmaxrees> you should use it. it'll tell you where the problem is.
[12:57:26] <BTM> I have and I have a 5400ms thing taking place
[12:57:45] <BTM> but that is just listed as "idle"
[12:58:25] <robertmaxrees> so when does this code run?
[12:58:31] <robertmaxrees> i feel like there's some missing information.
[12:59:02] <BTM> Its set to run on ready
[12:59:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'll need to see a functooning example.
[13:00:28] <BTM> http://bit.ly/2lHMQHF try this
[13:05:34] <robertmaxrees> so it's just on pageload that it's slow?
[13:06:10] <BTM> no, it appends everything fine, but the time from where it's appended and the time it renders is where it's bad
[13:07:04] <robertmaxrees> so when does that action happen?
[13:08:40] <robertmaxrees> webpack is taking a ton of time here.
[13:08:54] <BTM> which action? the render?
[13:09:09] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing that render is the issue?
[13:09:21] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying that but I
[13:09:29] <robertmaxrees> *i'm not seeing anything that says rendering is the issue.
[13:10:35] <BTM> When you refresh the page, how long does it take for the left side list to actually appear on the page?
[13:10:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:10:47] <robertmaxrees> you're focusing on the wrong things.
[13:11:08] <BTM> What do you mean?
[13:11:27] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying 'rendering' and then referencing just watching the page.
[13:11:35] <robertmaxrees> your profiler tells a different story.
[13:11:50] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/FjaWXXs.png
[13:12:00] <BTM> Im not sure the official term of it then. I say render because render is used to describe it being painted/drawn on the page
[13:12:01] <robertmaxrees> notice how total time on rendering is all of 225.2 ms?
[13:12:17] <robertmaxrees> but how scripting and loading total over 2000 ms?
[13:12:23] <robertmaxrees> see where the problem lies now>?
[13:12:44] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/d7A0JIZ.png
[13:12:55] <BTM> Yes, but what is that part called then? The part between after the elements are in my html and the part of where they actually appear?
[13:12:57] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying "render" is the issue but the evidence says it is not.
[13:13:22] <robertmaxrees> see the right-hand part of that last screenshot?>
[13:13:27] <robertmaxrees> with the "heaviest stack"?
[13:14:11] <BTM> Yes I see that, but thats not what I mean. Clearly i'm using the wrong terminology for it. But in it's base definition, I am defining the time it takes for it to actually appear after being appended as 'rendering' the element
[13:14:30] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm explaining the why.
[13:15:12] <robertmaxrees> it takes over 2 seconds to load and evaluate your js.
[13:15:16] <robertmaxrees> and webpack is working really hard.
[13:16:19] <BTM> Is that due to having a ton of scripts?
[13:16:54] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you kill the custom fonts?
[13:17:15] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you putting scriptws inline in the page?
[13:17:28] <robertmaxrees> simpletabs should be in its own file.
[13:18:12] <BTM> Because thats the way I have to build it on this cms, it has custom modules where you put your scripting
[13:18:27] <robertmaxrees> wut.
[13:18:33] <robertmaxrees> what's the cms?
[13:19:42] <BTM> moved it to it's own file
[13:20:20] <BTM> it's a weird set up but I have to keep things editable for my co workers who don't know code. By moving it out into it's own file, it can't be edited in our editor
[13:20:30] <BTM> that's why it's hard to create a fiddle of it
[13:20:39] <robertmaxrees> that should make it easier, but ok.
[13:20:48] <robertmaxrees> so what happens if you kill those custom fonts?
[13:21:07] <BTM> which ones, font awesome?
[13:21:15] <robertmaxrees> all of 'em.
[13:21:42] <BTM> The avenir are brought in on our total site header so i can't exactly remove those
[13:22:08] <robertmaxrees> you can't remove them from your test environment just to verify?
[13:22:45] <BTM> My test environment is linked directly to our actual site
[13:22:58] <[Alexandros]> hi
[13:23:02] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:23:14] <robertmaxrees> BTM your font loading looks like it's causing some FOUC.
[13:23:17] <robertmaxrees> plus webpack.
[13:24:45] <BTM> Hmm so you think that flash is what's killing the load time?
[13:24:54] <robertmaxrees> not load time.
[13:25:03] <robertmaxrees> but i think you've got a few major problems here.
[13:25:42] <BTM> Well I just moved the fonts, so they shouldn't be loading on this page anymore
[13:25:52] <robertmaxrees> that make it any better?
[13:26:38] <BTM> take a look, not really though
[13:26:45] <robertmaxrees> link again?
[13:28:16] <BTM> robertmaxrees http://bit.ly/2lHMQHF
[13:30:32] <robertmaxrees> so now it looks like you're held up by that tabber init.
[13:31:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, your scripting is still taking 2 seconds.
[13:32:10] <BTM> Which one? Because the left side one is the one that gets generated by the array
[13:32:16] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:32:22] <robertmaxrees> the entire page is getting held up by webpack.
[13:32:32] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're not packaging these assets before sending them to the browser?
[13:32:50] <BTM> as in minifying?
[13:32:55] <robertmaxrees> as in concatenating.
[13:33:43] <BTM> I don't have any control over the server builds
[13:34:04] <robertmaxrees> who does?>
[13:34:18] <robertmaxrees> because the profile shows webpack taking forever,.
[13:34:50] <BTM> so, my part of the company is like a startup within a larger scale. The main site is built with using github and everything, but ours doesnt have that access
[13:35:38] <robertmaxrees> "hey so the site performs like shit and i jhave a sneaking suspicion it's because we're not packaging assets using webpack before sending to the browser."
[13:36:37] <BTM> I don't think it's the site as a whole, this is the only page that does this
[13:36:55] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just pointing out what i'm seeing.
[13:37:07] <robertmaxrees> why does all of this run client-side anyway?
[13:37:25] <BTM> I think it's a matter of me pushing the product to it's limit because of how this has to be built
[13:37:37] <BTM> I couldn't even answer that if I tried man
[13:37:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:38:15] <BTM> Luckily, we're gonna be undergoing a redesign where we should be getting moved into the github and server this time around, but I've been here for about a year and a half and never had a problem like this
[13:38:21] <robertmaxrees> either way, your page is spending an incredible amount of time chewing through js.
[13:38:35] <robertmaxrees> like, over 2 seconds.
[13:38:38] <robertmaxrees> so you need to fix that.
[13:38:43] <BTM> I'll look into if I can chop off any and go from there
[13:38:52] <robertmaxrees> there's some tab plugin that waits to init forever.
[13:39:10] <robertmaxrees> but everything should be on page, so you don't neeed a callback or anything.
[13:39:36] <BTM> Yeah like I was saying, it appends almost instantly, but it doesn't actually get shown until x-amount of seconds later
[13:39:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because it's taking a few seconds to even run the plugin.
[13:40:20] <BTM> I'm guessing that's simpletabs?
[13:40:26] <robertmaxrees> iirc yeah
[13:40:41] <MikeD_> simpletabs sounds like a misnomer
[13:40:42] <BTM> Cool, I'll look into rebuilding that and see if that fixes it
[13:40:56] <robertmaxrees> BTM rebuilding simpletabs won't fix it.
[13:40:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:41:11] <BTM> Well not so much rebuilding it
[13:41:21] <BTM> but creating a different tabber and not using simpletabs
[13:41:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not gonna fix the problem.
[13:41:48] <robertmaxrees> that's just changing the code that'll have the same problem.
[13:41:53] <robertmaxrees> your issue is stuff that fires before simpletabs.
[13:41:59] <robertmaxrees> your webpack setup is less than ideal.
[13:42:20] <BTM> Okay I get that, but I have no control over that
[13:42:26] <robertmaxrees> then you're SOL (shrug)
[13:43:17] <BTM> awesome
[13:43:54] <MikeD_> start over from a blank file, write less code  :p
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> *site
[13:44:03] <robertmaxrees> not file ;)
[13:44:18] <BTM> that's the dream
[13:47:36] <MikeD_> ok, so what's the difference between a site and a file?
[13:47:54] <robertmaxrees> rewriting one file won't fix his problem.
[13:48:08] <MikeD_> oh... gotcha
[13:50:39] <BTM> So I started stripping some stuff
[13:51:17] <MikeD_> i didn't scroll back... how big a problem is this, and how much 'bettering' can you expect from 'stripping some stuff' ?
[13:51:21] <BTM> and since this page is using iframes, I think some of the webpack errors are coming from those iframes. Removing them has increased the speed immensely, does that sound like I'm on the right track robermaxrees?
[13:51:41] <robertmaxrees> BTM there you go.
[13:51:46] <BTM> boom
[13:51:54] <robertmaxrees> loading entire other pages into a page is a big dodgy.
[13:51:58] <robertmaxrees> *bit
[13:52:03] <BTM> now i get to hold a meeting with the owners of that subdomain lol
[13:52:08] <MikeD_> iframes?!?  2003 much?
[13:52:12] <BTM> Yeah but we can't do it via CORS
[13:52:17] <robertmaxrees> BTM err
[13:52:28] <BTM> Atleast they are responsive now..
[13:52:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:52:39] <robertmaxrees> sounds like they need an API integration.
[13:52:47] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ plenty of people use iframes for plenty of things.
[13:53:14] <BTM> We have them, but not so much for what is in mind. I think iframes will be the v1 unfortunately
[13:53:35] <BTM> but it looked like some of the loading errors from the other domain could be fixed, so it would atleast be a little more optimized
[13:53:36] <MikeD_> i'm just very surprised that iframes are still used
[13:53:54] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ shouldn't be heh.  hell, lots of advertising platforms use them.
[13:54:05] <robertmaxrees> quick, easy, widely supported sandboxing.
[13:54:07] <BTM> It what you have to use if you can't pass a CORS header ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:55:04] <MikeD_> the only use I can understand is that advertising stuff, but that's more 'necessary evil' than an opportunity for tuning your design/implementation
[13:55:26] <MikeD_> but yeah, i've seen a crapload of 3rd party stuff make the primary site behave so badly that nobody would use it
[13:55:28] <robertmaxrees> plenty of vendors use them for all kinds of things.
[13:55:49] <BTM> We're using it to display a page of content in a training. Trust me, I'd rather use cors and only pull a single div, but like I said, can't get the header passed
[13:56:38] <BTM> well, I'm gonna go bang my head off a wall now, thanks for looking into this guys
[14:08:06] <russianlimpbog> iframes are kewl
[14:19:13] <robertmaxrees> welp
[14:19:57] <taplar> hmm?
[14:20:33] <phelix> Any idea why with firefox only it doesn't get the height of the <video> element using $('.class').height() ?
[14:20:40] <phelix> seems to work just fine on chrome and other browsers.
[14:21:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[14:25:59] <phelix> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/6gpae9g2/ seems to get it fine in firefox with the fiddle I setup. But using identical code. And it doesn't get it on my site..
[14:26:01] <phelix> really weird
[14:26:09] <robertmaxrees> cache?
[14:27:12] <phelix> not cache..
[14:27:22] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:27:24] <phelix> I can see changes and js is identical on the site to what it is in the code
[14:27:42] <phelix> in the console.log(vh) it always comes out as 0
[14:27:47] <phelix> in ff only
[14:28:16] <robertmaxrees> seems like maybe a css quirk froma  parent element.
[14:28:19] <WhirledPress> phelix, what if you set your css to 100vh;   vh in css is viewport-height units?
[14:28:31] <phelix> let me try
[14:28:52] <taplar> vh, percentage of viewport height
[14:29:44] <WhirledPress> correct, sorry I should have been clearer.
[14:32:45] <phelix> didn't seem to work. Funny thing is. I have it set to adjust on window resize. When I resize the window it adjust and looks just fine. Just doesn't get it on initial screen load
[14:33:06] <WhirledPress> trigger resize on load?
[14:33:19] <robertmaxrees> sounds like an inherited css problem.
[14:33:28] <robertmaxrees> there's probably some positioning going ont hat breaks things.
[14:33:36] <phelix> Yes, the video is absolute
[14:33:50] <robertmaxrees> any containers doing anything funky with width/height?
[14:34:46] <phelix> I just have this video that I am trying to get the size from as absolute
[14:35:29] <phelix> weird though that as soon as I resize the window it works perfectly. And its the same function that does both
[14:36:09] <WhirledPress> is it running the function before the video is loaded, maybe?
[14:36:39] <robertmaxrees> can you share the broken version?
[14:36:41] <phelix> Thats what I was thinking. But if that was the case should it be broke in chrome also? Do both browsers fire off at the same time
[14:36:51] <phelix> yes http://realestate.mindimage.net
[14:36:53] <robertmaxrees> also: why do you need the resize via js?
[14:37:17] <phelix> not sure if there is a better way to keep that video full width like that and also with resizing the screen.
[14:37:28] <robertmaxrees> CSS.
[14:37:31] <phelix> You can see as soon as you resize it the content goes under the video like its supposed to
[14:39:07] <phelix> if i remember right reason i didn't use solid css is because this video needs to be absolute so I can put text and content over the top of it.
[14:39:22] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/6gpae9g2/2/
[14:40:28] <phelix> WhirledPress: didn't seem to fix it.
[14:41:27] <WhirledPress> guess I don't understand what you want. You want fullscreen width video and a block beneath it, right?
[14:41:54] <phelix> That block of "Reasons to hire a realtor" needs to be after the video.
[14:41:59] <phelix> directly underneath it
[14:42:09] <phelix> but the text with the search bar etc needs to be on top of it
[14:42:17] <robertmaxrees> and how tall is the video?
[14:42:20] <robertmaxrees> always the height of the window?
[14:42:30] <phelix> correct
[14:42:42] <phelix> you can look on chrome. It works perfectly.
[14:42:52] <robertmaxrees> then why not just create an empty transparent div whose height is set to 100vh?
[14:42:58] <robertmaxrees> and pop that before the one you care about?
[14:43:09] <phelix> hmm..
[14:43:12] <robertmaxrees> or set the top margin of that particular element to 100vh?
[14:43:14] <phelix> not sure i tried that. Good idea.
[14:43:19] <robertmaxrees> or all sorts of other pure css options.
[14:43:33] <phelix> let me play with that. Thanks for the idea
[15:03:44] <jsharpminor> I'm trying to update some data tags on some <td>s when I move them around using jquery-ui. I have code that is supposed to do just that. The code executes, but the tags don't update.
[15:03:49] <jsharpminor> http://jsbin.com/jawecos/edit?html,output
[15:04:03] <jsharpminor> The problem area is near the bottom of the code.
[15:04:14] <jsharpminor> $(this).parent().append(draggedThis);
[15:04:26] <jsharpminor> $(this).siblings().each(function () {
[15:04:40] <taplar> this jsbin is yuge
[15:04:41] <jsharpminor> console.log("Data for " + $(this).children().html() +  " pos was " + $(this).data("pos") + " and should now be " + posCounter.count);
[15:04:47] <jsharpminor> $(this).data("pos", posCounter.count);
[15:04:55] <jsharpminor> console.log("Data has been updated to: " + $(this).data("pos"));
[15:05:15] <jsharpminor> I've flagged this area, if anyone wants to look, in the HTML section, in bright green letters
[15:05:28] <jsharpminor> Each of those console logs shows the correct data.
[15:05:37] <jsharpminor> But it's not actually going into the page.
[15:06:16] <taplar> why do you say that?
[15:06:19] <jsharpminor> Is it somehow just updating a jQuery object, and failing to actually propagate the change onto the page itself?
[15:06:39] <taplar> it's updating a cache that jquery keeps internally
[15:07:37] <taplar> there is typically not a reason to update the markup.  the markup is just there to load the dom.  you want to change/reference the dom or other things in memory
[15:10:33] <jsharpminor> I'm working with $(this), and I don't know what $(this)'s parent is. I want to update $(this) and all its siblings. I would do that straight in the DOM if I could, but I thought that was what jQuery was for? So I run an anonymous function on $(this).siblings, and presto, it has ...... done nothing?
[15:11:36] <taplar> console.log($(this).siblings().length); ?
[15:17:33] <stan_man_can> Trying to use jquery to set the scrollHeight on a div and it's not happening
[15:19:00] <stan_man_can> https://jsfiddle.net/eeaohyjv/2/
[15:19:26] <taplar> scrollHeight is a read only property
[15:19:33] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollHeight
[15:19:43] <jsharpminor> taplar: yes I get the number of siblings, but I'm not sure what that has to do with anything
[15:19:55] <stan_man_can> taplar: trying to set scrollTop not scrollHeight
[15:20:14] <stan_man_can> essentially i just need a way to have the overflow scroll start at the bottom not the top
[15:20:23] <taplar> jsharpminor: just debugging that it was actually finding siblings
[15:20:31] <jsharpminor> ok
[15:20:57] <jsharpminor> yeah, i had to fight through a few of those. I found lots of prevObjects, and eliminated them
[15:22:29] <jsharpminor> Basically I was attempting to use jQuery to find the address of things I needed to change. But you've just told me that all that I've found is an internal memory address for a copy of that object that jQuery is working with, and when I want to apply the change, it can't do it because it lost the address of the original item, so I should go and find it myself? That's what I'm hearing, and I'm a little stumped.
[15:22:44] <jsharpminor> +
[15:23:15] <taplar> stan_man_can: https://jsfiddle.net/eeaohyjv/3/  seems to work, no?
[15:23:50] <taplar> i just stated what data() does.
[15:23:59] <taplar> * jsharpminor
[15:24:25] <taplar> data(key) gets an internally set cache variable related to the element.  data(key, value) sets that variable
[15:24:37] <taplar> so long as your code uses data() consistently in this manner, it's all good
[15:24:47] <jsharpminor> but i have
[15:24:48] <jsharpminor> $(this).data("pos", posCounter.count);
[15:24:54] <taplar> if you intermix data() and attr() or other things, you're going to run into issues.
[15:25:11] <jsharpminor> so that should be (key, value), and it's updating the jQuery object, but not the page.
[15:25:17] <taplar> right
[15:25:25] <jsharpminor> how do I get it to update to the page?
[15:25:31] <taplar> then your code later will get that value data('pos') to then use it
[15:25:33] <taplar> you don't
[15:25:42] <taplar> why do you need to update the page?
[15:25:50] <taplar> or more specifically what are you calling 'the page'?
[15:26:28] <taplar> just so i know we are talking about the same thing
[15:26:44] <jsharpminor> On that jsbin I sent, I grab a number, say, how about a 73. I move it on top of another number. The other number disappears.
[15:27:20] <jsharpminor> I inspect the 73 before and after the move, in my google chrome developer tools. The data-pos is the same before and after the move, despite the code that sets data(key, value) in between.
[15:27:35] <taplar> right
[15:27:39] <taplar> cause it's internal at that point
[15:27:50] <taplar> your js code doesn't need to know what your inspector is showing
[15:28:06] <taplar> it just needs to know that data(key, value) sets it, and data(key) later gets the set value
[15:28:53] <taplar> if you have logic that doesn't use data() to get values then either change that logic to use the value, or change data() to be attr('data-key') instead
[15:29:02] <jsharpminor> I probably am doing a terrible job of managing state, I'll admit that, I guess. But I have other code that rebuilds the fractured grid and depends on the number it gets from the "data-pos" to do it correctly. If that number is screwed up, then it doesn't know how far to add the grid.
[15:29:27] <taplar> then use attr('data-pos', newValue) to change it instead of data()
[15:30:26] <jsharpminor> okay, that did it
[15:30:38] <jsharpminor> I had to fight that for a full day.
[15:30:56] <jsharpminor> so what's the use of data(key, value) if it doesn't propagate anywhere?
[15:31:20] <taplar> it stores it in a cache which has performance benefits.  if all your logic uses that, you gain that benefit
[15:31:35] <taplar> attr() doesn't cache
[15:31:45] <taplar> afair
[15:34:22] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7261619/jquery-data-vs-attr#7262427
[15:35:01] <taplar> i was also going to say the attr can only store strings part, but i wasn't 100% clear that i remembered that right
[15:38:13] * taplar wonders if he did something to make robertmaxrees angry
[15:38:20] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[15:38:33] <taplar> heh, nada.  just noticed here recently i'd pop in and you'd go quiet
[15:38:46] <robertmaxrees> oh. heh. mostly just timing.
[15:38:50] <robertmaxrees> i was getting a food.
[15:38:58] <robertmaxrees> plus the round of meds i'm on are fucking brutal.
[15:46:35] <stan_man_can> taplar: yeah
[15:46:37] <stan_man_can> wtf is the difference
[15:46:51] <taplar> with what specifically?
[15:47:43] <stan_man_can> I linked to https://jsfiddle.net/eeaohyjv/2/
[15:47:46] <stan_man_can> which doesn't work
[15:47:49] <stan_man_can> you linked to https://jsfiddle.net/eeaohyjv/3/  which does work
[15:48:05] <taplar> i added jquery to the fiddle and made it load in the body
[15:48:28] <taplar> it's in a ready, so the body part was probably not necessary
[15:48:48] <taplar> yeah, just needed jquery added
[15:49:43] <stan_man_can> i swear that i had added it
[15:50:21] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can you added jquery ui
[15:50:24] <stan_man_can> oh
[15:50:24] <robertmaxrees> but not jquery itself.
[15:50:24] <stan_man_can> FML
[15:50:33] <stan_man_can> sorry bad copy paste i guess
[15:50:37] <stan_man_can> time to find out why it's not working on my actual site then
[15:51:47] <robertmaxrees> check your console.
[15:51:53] <robertmaxrees> see if you're getting errors or w/e
[15:53:24] <stan_man_can> no errors
[15:53:27] <stan_man_can> i can't even make it work in console
[15:57:39] <stan_man_can> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[15:57:44] <stan_man_can> ugh
[15:57:45] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:57:51] <stan_man_can> i had two divs
[15:58:04] <stan_man_can> <div id="chatLog"> <div id="chatLogText"></div</div>
[15:58:16] <robertmaxrees> k
[15:58:24] <stan_man_can> chatLog had overflow-Y set to auto, chatLogText had height: 420px;
[15:58:41] <stan_man_can> so it was all messy
[17:03:41] <sine0> im sorry to ask this here, im havinga bit of troubl
[17:04:01] <sine0> how can i use jquery to write into the textbox area here: <input name="input_1" id="input_1_1" type="text" value="" class="medium" tabindex="1" aria-invalid="false">
[17:04:32] <sine0> $('#input_1_1').val("why-wont-it-work");
[17:35:16] <ozcanesen> sine0: this code is correct and works for me
[17:41:43] <sine0> i have worked it out just now. noob error on my part. thanks for having a go :D
[18:04:37] <juinn> guys how do i trigger a click function in my plugin from outside?
[18:52:05] <cjohnson> juinn: you can use .trigger() to trigger arbitrary events on arbitrary nodes
[18:52:12] <cjohnson> if that doesn't answer, try pasting some code and clarifying your question
[20:19:19] <nazar> hello, what's the difference between i++ and ++i ?
[20:19:29] <robertmaxrees> one increments before, the other after.
[20:19:31] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[20:20:00] <nazar> because i'm lost
[20:20:06] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[20:20:51] <nazar> I would like to know what each one is
[20:21:36] <robertmaxrees> one increments before returning the value, the other after.
[20:22:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/pacm8fhe/
[20:25:58] <nazar> What is the code of each example?
[20:26:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:26:24] <robertmaxrees> the code is right there...
[20:26:37] <robertmaxrees> could you give some more context so I can better help?
[20:27:19] <nazar> I know that i++ is i = i + 1
[20:27:33] <robertmaxrees> the only difference is what gets returned
[20:27:37] <robertmaxrees> like i said.
[20:27:50] <robertmaxrees> they both increment the variable.
[20:28:33] <nazar> ok, then, ++i is i = 1 + i ?
[20:28:46] <robertmaxrees> thjey both increment the variable.
[20:28:52] <robertmaxrees> the difference is in what gets returned.
[20:29:04] <robertmaxrees> i don't know hgow to phrase that anyu differently other than to show yhou in the fiddle.
[20:29:19] <snover> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2B%2B
[20:29:30] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:30:05] <robertmaxrees> like - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pacm8fhe/1/
[20:30:14] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[20:33:03] <nazar> ok, thanks, Sincerely
[20:33:49] <nazar> It was a lot of help for me
[20:35:36] <nazar> Good bye
