[00:29:33] <sms> Has anybody here happened to use https://esimakin.github.io/twbs-pagination/#demo before
[02:02:31] <fas3r> I have an object where the key "next" is recursively used. like : myObj.next.next.next.next ...  is there a way to access the last  ".next" value ? or I need to do a recurcive function for that ?
[05:16:09] <graingert> fas3r: doing a tail recursive function is a good idea, but you need a Babel plugin to optimize it
[05:16:34] <graingert> fas3r: the other option is a while loop
[05:56:08] <fas3r> graingert: what is a babel plugin ?
[06:01:10] <graingert> fas3r: it's a thing that adds additional capabilities to Babel
[06:23:26] <fas3r> do you have an example for such case ?
