[00:34:16] <docmur> How do I get these functions to fire? https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/8389/  I have a function which is generating a table and I want to use this kind of method to dynamically bind action buttons, but I can't get my functions to fire
[01:03:44] <pavonia> docmur: What about this approach? https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/8390/
[01:54:32] <Cork> docmur, pavonia: you want to use delegated event handlers for that case, and then you won't need to have the dynamic click binders
[01:55:54] <pavonia> I thought about that, but wasn't sure how to add two different handlers for the same div
[01:56:35] <pavonia> Probably give both buttons different classes?
[01:58:15] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/8395/
[01:58:26] <Cork> also you don't want to append in a loop, it is horrible for performance
[01:59:49] <Cork> the reason i moved the click handler out of the append function is cause you should ever only call them once
[02:00:16] <Cork> (as they will work for all elements in the div)
[03:33:28] <alraz> dff
[06:13:18] <Igzzz> hello
[06:13:39] <Igzzz> I am having difficulties using on() delegation
[06:15:32] <Igzzz> may someone help ?
[06:16:17] <Uhkis> not until you provide enough information
[06:16:35] <Igzzz> I will :) thank you
[06:19:42] <Igzzz> So I have an html element that contains several elements generated from a database, these generated elements all have the same class. Then I have an 'each' fucntion for these elements, and inside this each, I have an on click function that I need to attach to every element's delete button.
[06:21:06] <Igzzz> When a click is made on of these delete buttons, it will delete the entire element, so I need to load again the parent div containing all the previously generated elements
[06:22:07] <Igzzz> so inside the each, i've made up something like $(document).on('click', $(this).find('.delete-button'), functino() {....}
[06:22:42] <Igzzz> the problem is, wherever I click on the entire page, the function gets executed
[06:26:13] <Igzzz> it seems that the issue comes from the $(this).find('.delete-button') parameter, because when I put  $('.delete-button') it works, but not the way I want to
[06:29:24] <localh0st> Igzzz: code
[06:29:43] <localh0st> +
[06:29:44] <localh0st> so inside the each, i've made up something like $(document).on('click', $(this).find('.delete-button'), functino() {....}
[06:30:19] <localh0st> this is incorrect, you've created multiple listeners for the same selector
[06:31:25] <localh0st> you don't need to set .on() on newly created elements because it's dynamic listener, you'd rather should use $('.delete-button').click()
[06:31:56] <localh0st> but using .on somewhere outside of each loop should be correct as well
[06:32:22] <Igzzz> http://jsbin.com/mapitavixo/edit?html,js,output
[06:36:25] <Igzzz> yes but if I use click, when the entire div will reload, the events won't be attached to the other elements
[07:11:37] <igzzz> sorry i have been disconnected
[07:12:01] <igzzz> i didn't receive your answers
[07:48:39] <Cork> igzzz: create a jsfiddle with the script and html your working with
[07:51:27] <igzzz>   http://jsbin.com/mapitavixo/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:52:18] <igzzz> the issue is in the $(document).on('click'... section
[07:52:23] <igzzz> in the each
[07:53:02] <Birliban> Hi, I got an example from https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/#bloodhound and put it here: https://jsfiddle.net/43qum102/ Could someone pls explain why there is var states declared twice? once as object, once as array... is this valid?
[07:53:06] <Cork> igzzz: the click handler is meant to take a string not a dom element
[07:53:41] <igzzz> okay
[07:53:44] <Cork> so $(document).on('click', $delBtn, function() { should be   $(document).on('click', '.btn-del-col', function() {
[07:53:49] <igzzz> that's what I just thought
[07:54:16] <Cork> also you are trying to access variables from the each loop in the click handler
[07:54:19] <igzzz> yes but when I do this, when I click on a delete button, it triggers the event for all buttons
[07:54:24] <Cork> and that is in different scopes so you can't do that
[07:55:19] <igzzz> ok but why can I do this in the $sbmBtn.click function?
[07:55:30] <igzzz> in this last one the scope is the same
[07:57:55] <igzzz> I don't want the handler to be attached to every class' element, but I want a handler for each element
[08:01:07] <Cork> igzzz: cause you prob did it in the each loop so it inherited the scope
[08:07:19] <igzzz> the $(document).on('click'... function is in the each loop too
[08:23:51] <Cork> igzzz: you should not be in the each loop
[08:24:02] <Cork> that would make the delegation pointless
[08:27:28] <codecutter> ajax call url is '/secure/post/sym.l', when i check the value that is sent to the server it's 'sym' not 'sym.l'
[08:27:34] <codecutter> why is this?
[08:27:47] <codecutter> and how do i fix it?
[08:28:03] <codecutter> or is it something else altogether?
[08:29:11] <codecutter> anyone?
[08:47:49] <jqueryyyer> hi guys, i am trying to use mocha js + zombie js to add tests for my jquery spa. I am having trouble making a test verifying that jquery datatables has been initialized. it appears the test is running before the datatable has the chance to run, because it does show the datatable on page loads from the Firefox browser
[08:49:37] <jqueryyyer> it is loading the page and also executing the js + I can use jquery from the window in my tests (yay) so do you know if there is an event or something I can look for, or some other solution to verify that the datatable has been initialized?
[08:51:49] <digimer> Hi all. I'm totally new to jquery..., so I have this in html: '<div id="network_status"/>' and in my .js file I have this; '$( "#network_status" ).on('load', function() { alert('foo'); });', but it doesn't seem to fire the alert, but this does; '$( document ).ready(function() { alert('bar'); });', the the html and js seem to be loading.
[08:52:07] <MassDebates> fiddle?
[08:52:15] <MassDebates> or https://codepen.io/pen ?
[08:52:56] <MassDebates> By the way, not sure if it's a typo or if you're trying to escape the code because it's IRC (no idea why you would)
[08:53:05] <MassDebates> but div isn't a self closing element in HTML
[08:53:29] <digimer> oh, my typo then
[08:53:40] * digimer tries with </div>
[08:54:01] <igzzz> anyone knows why the this.selector property has been deprecated
[08:54:06] <igzzz> ?
[08:54:15] <digimer> changed to '<div id="network_status"></div>', still didn't fire
[08:55:40] <MassDebates> Are you intent on using .ready or .on?
[08:55:48] <MassDebates> And are you aware of the consequential differences between them?
[08:56:17] <shoky> digimer: 'load' event should only be used on the window object, or on images or iframes, it fires when the window/img finished loading all resources
[08:56:19] <MassDebates> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/yXOWrg
[08:56:45] <digimer> shoky: oh, ok, what should I use in this case?
[08:56:53] <MassDebates> probably ready.
[08:57:03] <MassDebates> http://api.jquery.com/on/ this is the .on api
[08:57:13] <shoky> digimer: you haven't even said what the problem is, or what you want to do ;)
[08:57:18] <MassDebates> Check out the events possible with .on and see if there's anything you'd be happy with :P
[08:57:18] <igzzz> I am using delegation with on() and I need to convert a DOM element to a string to select this particular element
[08:57:28] <shoky> digimer: but assuming you want it to happen on page load,  then $(document).ready
[08:57:56] <digimer> I have a <table ...> </table> with some entries in it that I want to update based on XML I am trying to read
[08:58:13] <digimer> but before any of that, I was trying to just get a simple 'alert' to fire when the table was loaded
[08:58:19] <digimer> just to get a starting point
[08:58:34] * digimer is a sysadmin trying to learn web stuff and not doing so well so far... 
[08:58:42] <MassDebates> ah
[08:58:44] <MassDebates> that's much more detail
[08:59:17] <digimer> if it helps, I'll post the table and XML, one moment
[08:59:40] <MassDebates> That's probably not necessary.
[08:59:51] <MassDebates> Are you going to be changing these values? Like live??
[09:00:01] <MassDebates> $(function() { might be a simple, easy way to go tbh
[09:00:13] <MassDebates> $(function() {                       }
[09:00:24] <digimer> https://jsfiddle.net/p4dwpztj/
[09:00:41] <digimer> MassDebates: yes, change the values live is the plan
[09:01:00] <digimer> specifically, I update the XML whenever a network interface link state changes, and I wnt to show the change in the HTML
[09:01:18] <digimer> but I figured I should start with a simple "hello, world" but wasn't able to get even that much working. heh
[09:01:39] <digimer> I'm open to any other/better approach, I am just starting
[09:01:55] <digimer> eventually though, different pages will show different "chunks" that will get updated
[09:02:30] <digimer> so I didn't want to be reading and parsing a bunch of XML unless the table showing the given data was on screen, which is why I was trying to trigger a function when a given id="x" was loaded
[09:07:04] <digimer> got it! <table id="x"> ... </table> -> $( "#network_status" ).ready(function() { alert('foo'); });
[09:07:11] <digimer> step 1 of N...
[09:07:43] <digimer> now to read/parse XML...
[09:07:47] <shoky> digimer: no, don't use .ready on anything except $(document)
[09:07:57] <digimer> >_<
[09:08:00] <digimer> ok
[09:08:15] <shoky> digimer: that will run it when the document is ready, i.e. when the html has been parsed and processed by the browser
[09:08:44] <MassDebates> @ shoky why not anything besides document?
[09:08:56] <MassDebates> What about $('img').ready ??
[09:08:58] <digimer> ok, what should I use? I am not sure how to use MassDebates's $(function() {} enable...
[09:09:01] <digimer> example*
[09:09:15] <shoky> MassDebates: running it on anything would have the same effect
[09:09:21] <shoky> MassDebates: it has nothing to do with any element
[09:09:34] <shoky> images don't have any "ready" event
[09:09:48] <MassDebates> Right, but there's no problem, right?
[09:10:04] <MassDebates> $(function() { is equivalent for .ready
[09:10:05] <digimer> I don't have an image in this table... I support I could add a 1px transparent dot but that seems messy
[09:10:06] <MassDebates> @ digimer
[09:10:17] <FilipNortic> confusing code is kind of a problem...
[09:10:21] <shoky> MassDebates: there is a problem . ye ^
[09:10:42] <shoky> code that says it's doing one thing, but is not really , is bad code ;)
[09:10:49] <MassDebates> It just seemed like you were making the point that it breaks stuff, which confused me
[09:10:52] <digimer> MassDebates: sorry, I'm 101, how to I run that function when a specific table loads?
[09:11:07] <igzzz> http://jsbin.com/xavevebume/edit?js,output
[09:11:18] <MassDebates> digimer: .ready would be implied with the code i've supplied in the chat - $(function() {
[09:11:29] <igzzz> does anyone knows a better way of selecting the element I want to attach the event to?
[09:11:33] <digimer> so I don't want that then?
[09:11:46] <MassDebates> $(function() {  is the same as $( document ).ready(function() {
[09:11:49] <shoky> MassDebates: it breaks the code  :)
[09:11:52] <digimer> sorry, I'm feeling really dumb right now... I don't know why I am struggling with this so much
[09:11:56] <shoky> not the page :p
[09:12:05] <igzzz> like giving an html element instead of a string + var
[09:12:09] <MassDebates> shoky:  That's really clever to say, I'm stealing that.
[09:12:18] <MassDebates> digimer:  $(function() {  is the same as $( document ).ready(function() {
[09:12:22] <MassDebates> digimer:  https://api.jquery.com/ready/
[09:12:26] <shoky> heh
[09:12:29] <MassDebates> This page will explain .ready() in  a more complete sense
[09:12:38] <digimer> MassDebates: but I thought that shoky just said not to do that?
[09:12:43] <digimer> that's why I am confused
[09:12:48] <MassDebates> digimer:  you've misunderstood shoky.
[09:13:05] <MassDebates> digimer:  He was saying not to do something else because of coding practices for easily understood and smart/clean code
[09:13:19] <MassDebates> digimer:   $(function() { is the same thing as $( document ).ready(function() {
[09:13:26] <MassDebates> I would suggest the first because it's smaller.
[09:13:34] <MassDebates> Some people say the second because it's more 'descriptive'
[09:13:40] <MassDebates> (say someone joins your project - they'll know what it is)
[09:13:54] <digimer> how does it know to fire that function without the name of the id="x" from <table id="x"> ?
[09:14:11] <MassDebates> Consider the two functions both as 'coveralls'
[09:14:15] <MassDebates> like an umbrella effect.
[09:14:27] <shoky> digimer: yeah sorry, i meant don't run .ready on some element,   it's ok to do $(function  too, in fact jquery 3 prefers that for some reason
[09:14:53] <MassDebates> digimer:  ah, I see your confusion
[09:15:08] <digimer> so I should do '<table $(function() {})>'? that doesn't seem right
[09:15:08] <MassDebates> digimer:  You see - both of those statements wait for the document ot be ready. the 'document'
[09:15:25] <MassDebates> digimer:  the 'document' will never be ready until everything inside the 'document' is ready (with exceptions)
[09:15:32] <digimer> I just want to fire a function when a table loads...
[09:15:42] <MassDebates> digimer:  if the table is 'ready' then the 'document' is also ready. Which is what you can depend on.
[09:15:46] <MassDebates> digimer:  do you see?
[09:16:07] <digimer> but there are times when the document won't have the table
[09:16:20] <digimer> sorry, I don't, I'm really struggling
[09:16:52] <digimer> I must be fundamentally misunderstanding something. I know this should be simple, and I know you guys know what you're doing, but somewhere I have a disconnect
[09:17:10] <MassDebates> Presence detection isn't the same as document ready. Instead of waiting for the document to be ready to be interacted with, I would wait for 'changes' to happen to the table since you're trying to detect changes to values
[09:17:22] <MassDebates> er, 'changes' to happen to the values since you're trying to change the table*
[09:17:26] <MassDebates> Jeez, rough morning.
[09:17:51] <MassDebates> I think I need to go throw some cold water at my face
[09:18:40] <digimer> can I ask a big favour for a code sample? maybe that will help... I've got this HTML table and I want to run the function when the table loads. can you give me an example of the best way to do this? Maybe I'll see where I am going wrong.
[09:18:40] <Birliban> Hi, I got an example from https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/#bloodhound and put it here: https://jsfiddle.net/43qum102/ Could someone pls explain why there is var states declared twice? once as object, once as array... is this valid?
[09:18:44] <digimer> https://jsfiddle.net/p4dwpztj/
[09:19:33] <digimer> sorry, here's the current version - https://jsfiddle.net/p4dwpztj/1/
[09:19:47] <MassDebates> okay digimer here's a couple things for ya
[09:20:11] <MassDebates> jquery is a library. This means it's a bunch of pre-written javascript code that you can pretty much treat like shortcut snippet superhero thingies
[09:20:30] <digimer> that I get
[09:20:41] <MassDebates> Javascript doesn't know this code automatically. you need to put jquery in there and load it so the code is there and workable
[09:20:43] <digimer> I'm fairly new to JS itself, I should say
[09:20:59] <digimer> I've been writing perl for 20 years, but web is all new
[09:20:59] <MassDebates> then the code you write references the code included in jquery
[09:21:08] <digimer> ok, following so far fine
[09:21:17] <MassDebates> http://imgur.com/a/OE13R
[09:21:29] <MassDebates> jsfiddle has a nice button
[09:21:36] <MassDebates> but you should learn to load jquery for real on your own
[09:21:42] <MassDebates> but youll do that when you implement.
[09:21:57] <MassDebates> Figure out your script now in an easy to develop/learn environment, like codepen or jsfiddle.
[09:22:02] <digimer> I've copied the jquery library to my server and reference it in <head>
[09:22:07] <MassDebates> when you get something up and going that works, then you can start fitting it into your current environment.
[09:22:16] <MassDebates> okay
[09:22:37] <MassDebates> Consider using the APi to take advantage of fixes, optimizations, and updates to the code.
[09:22:43] <digimer> I just can't seem to figure out this conditional load of a function based on the presence of a table or now
[09:22:46] <digimer> not*
[09:23:06] <MassDebates> Slow down.
[09:23:11] <digimer> ok
[09:23:11] <MassDebates> One step at a time
[09:23:23] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/xrovfvc1/ this has jquery loaded now.
[09:23:25] <digimer> I thought this was a reasonable first step, sorry
[09:23:29] <MassDebates> it also has that code I've suggested.
[09:24:20] <MassDebates> Now, here's something else.
[09:24:22] <digimer> in your example, foo alerted
[09:24:28] <MassDebates> Right, but let's move forward.
[09:24:33] <digimer> ok
[09:24:34] <MassDebates> Jquery can modify things in the DOM
[09:24:44] <MassDebates> This basically, for you, means the webpage html elements.
[09:24:46] <digimer> can you explain this DOM?
[09:24:52] <MassDebates> This basically, for you, means the webpage html elements.
[09:25:01] <digimer> just high level, I was assuming "DOM == code", basically
[09:25:12] <MassDebates> DOM = all stuff between <html> and </htlm>
[09:25:12] <digimer> ok, so I was right~ish
[09:25:19] <digimer> ah, ok, thanks
[09:25:30] <MassDebates> WHat i said was incorrect, but it works for what you're doing.
[09:25:35] <digimer> ok
[09:25:57] <MassDebates> Jquery is javascript, but let's just call it jq - When you do something in jq, say, like adding some text to a cell in a table or changing a font color
[09:26:10] <digimer> ok
[09:26:24] <MassDebates> you can do something called 'selecting' or giving a 'selector' to jquery to 'find' or 'target' a given piece of the webpage. Body, element, something by .class, #id, etc.
[09:26:42] <digimer> ok, and that is what the id="X" do, right?
[09:26:47] <MassDebates> If you select something that doesn't exist and try to make a change, however, |||no change is made.|||
[09:26:49] <digimer> that's what jq looks for?
[09:27:09] <MassDebates> Sometimes, when people don't know of the standard/best-practice way of detecting something, they'll try to make a change and detect if the change was made.
[09:27:32] <MassDebates> ID="XX" could be an ID that jquery could be told to look for, yes. But it could also look for lots and lots of other stuff.
[09:27:36] <digimer> I certainly fall into that category
[09:27:38] <MassDebates> maybe a class='classA'
[09:27:40] <MassDebates> or maybe BOTH!
[09:27:49] <digimer> ok
[09:27:51] <jqueryyyer> do you know where is the right place to ask about zombie js + jquery?
[09:28:08] <digimer> so I want to have jq look for id="x" and if it finds it, do something, otherwise not
[09:28:20] <Cork> jqueryyyer: depends on what the question is about
[09:28:28] <digimer> at leeast, that is what I think I want
[09:28:40] <MassDebates> Well, here's at the spot where we're coming into your http://xyproblem.info issue.
[09:28:54] * digimer reads
[09:29:00] <jqueryyyer> hi guys, i am trying to use mocha js + zombie js to add tests for my jquery spa. I am having trouble making a test verifying that jquery datatables has been initialized. it appears the test is running before the datatable has the chance to run, because it does show the datatable on page loads from the Firefox browser
[09:29:01] <jqueryyyer> do you know where is the right place to ask about zombie js + jquery?
[09:29:03] <digimer> fair enough
[09:29:06] <MassDebates> You see, you have a goal in mind and you think the right thing to do to figure it out is to detect if the table's present and ready to be interacted with.
[09:29:08] <jqueryyyer> it is loading the page and also executing the js + I can use jquery from the window in my tests (yay) so do you know if there is an event or something I can look for, or some other solution to verify that the datatable has been initialized?
[09:29:22] <digimer> then I will re-ask; How do I do something based on something existing?
[09:29:26] <MassDebates> Now that you have a basic working knowledge of loaidng up jquery into an IDE, you are now ready to figure out how to solve the issue.
[09:29:52] <digimer> ok
[09:30:02] <digimer> I do appreciate this a lot, btw, thank you
[09:30:04] <MassDebates> I, unfortunately, am the wrong person to help you solve that. I've never made a live updated network dashboard before. But I would suggest you ask someone else here who does, as you are now ready to receive help effectively.
[09:30:04] <Cork> jqueryyyer: if the question is about the zombie.js part of the combination it is #zombie.js if it is the jquery part it is here
[09:30:21] <digimer> ok
[09:30:30] <digimer> can I start a lot simpler though?
[09:30:31] <MassDebates> I'll be honest, I'm pretty trash with javascript - I'm a marketer. But these guys are smart cookies. They'll help you out
[09:30:39] <MassDebates> Yes, yes you can.
[09:30:46] <Cork> jqueryyyer: that said try to as the question short, and then give the background separately, else it becomes very hard to find the question
[09:30:54] <Cork> to ask *
[09:31:06] <MassDebates> Our IT guy uses Mako  and they have a nice network display. Maybe check out projects taht do something similar to what you're doing.
[09:31:10] <digimer> the core thing I want to do is to run a function if a table exists. for now, a simple "alert" or console.log
[09:31:13] <MassDebates> Open source projects are great sources to learn from code
[09:31:33] <MassDebates> digimer:  Google "jquery check if div exists"
[09:31:58] <digimer> everything I've found so far seems to expect a lot more experience than I have. I've got 20 some tabs open to sample source and I can't make heads or tails of it, given what I am trying to do
[09:31:59] <MassDebates> You'll be surprised at what IRC questions google can help you with
[09:32:02] <Cork> digimer: what do you want to do this check?
[09:32:12] <Cork> opps when not what :P
[09:32:55] <digimer> Cork: the end goal is to have a set of tables or things that want to display different pieces of updating data, and read in XML files containing that data
[09:33:22] <digimer> eventually I will have a lot of different items and and I don't want to read/parse the XML files that aren't related to items being displayed
[09:33:24] <Cork> digimer: if you have a choice is would recommend against using xml
[09:33:30] <Cork> it is slow a ***
[09:33:46] <Cork> it is MUCH simpler to send json for the data if you have a choice
[09:33:54] <digimer> so I've heard, but everything on the back end is XML and I want to work on one issue at a time
[09:33:58] <MassDebates> conversion is an option too
[09:34:06] <MassDebates> XML > JSON > JQ
[09:34:10] <Cork> that is the better choice ya
[09:34:16] <MassDebates> Or, really, XML > JS > JSON > JQ
[09:34:21] <MassDebates> becuase you'd be using js to convert
[09:34:29] <digimer> I am struggling so much right now, I don't want to complicate things by converting existing data structures, but I will look at that later in dev
[09:34:30] <Cork> cause to handle xml you hacve to take the xml, parse it into a document, then query the document
[09:34:35] <Cork> and then from there grab the data you want
[09:34:44] <Cork> while json can just be converted into a javascript object
[09:34:53] <MassDebates> It may be more complicated to avoid the conversion than to just do it now, digimer.
[09:34:59] <jqueryyyer> Cork, I will rephrase my question- What would you use to add integration tests to a jquery spa and why?
[09:35:00] <MassDebates> In a sense, the test would take longer than the procedure
[09:35:11] <igzzz> please may someone tell me if there is a way to get a selector from an object? I am making a delegation but the on() function needs a String as selector, I don't want to use something like '#btn-' + id
[09:35:11] <Cork> digimer: i can almost guarantee you it will be easier to do the convertion server side then doing it in js
[09:35:17] <Cork> cause you will have to do it someplace
[09:35:18] <digimer> MassDebates: ok, I'll look at that after I solve my simple alert example
[09:35:34] <digimer> I really need to keep as few variables in play, given how hard I am struggling right now
[09:36:08] <digimer> I can change the server-side data structure to json, and I will
[09:36:12] <digimer> step 2
[09:36:19] <digimer> I'm still on step 1 though
[09:36:20] <Cork> jqueryyyer: i would prob use quint, mainly cause it is what jquery is tested with
[09:36:24] <Cork> http://qunitjs.com/
[09:36:26] * digimer googles MassDebates's string
[09:36:45] <digimer> testing will be step 3, I think
[09:36:58] <digimer> I know testing is important, I know json is smoother
[09:37:03] <MassDebates> digimer I would suggest you listen to Cork here - "I want to just do this simple piece first and then I'll go back and change it to be how it should be - two steps"
[09:37:05] <Cork> igzzz: from the code you had you don't need the id
[09:37:12] <MassDebates> These two steps are longer tahn just doing it right in the first place.
[09:37:23] <Cork> ya
[09:37:25] <digimer> MassDebates: I will, I'll convert the data to json before I start parsing
[09:37:36] <MassDebates> no
[09:37:45] <MassDebates> Don't build the house and say "i'll fix the pipes before i turn on the water"
[09:37:49] <igzzz> why you say I don't need the ID?
[09:37:50] <Cork> igzzz: what you want is to bind a click handler and from there check $(this).closest() or similar to find where you are
[09:37:50] <digimer> I meant that "step 1" was to fire on existence of a given div, I can use a simple 'alert' for this
[09:37:52] <MassDebates> lay down the pipes in the ground first.
[09:38:00] <MassDebates> Don't learn about testing divs yet.
[09:38:01] <Cork> igzzz: cause then you have to do what you just stated
[09:38:07] <MassDebates> Don't learn about building the roof until you start building the roof.
[09:38:24] <digimer> MassDebates: what I meant is that I will do it after I get the conditional alert happening. or are you saying I need to do something else before even that?
[09:38:29] <igzzz> yes but the main div is reloaded
[09:38:34] <igzzz> so the handlers get lost
[09:38:49] <Cork> ya cause you aren't using delegation
[09:38:57] <igzzz> I am using delegation
[09:39:11] <Cork> no your binding specific handler that are still bound to the old elements
[09:39:15] <Cork> that isn't delegation
[09:39:19] <Cork> its just messy
[09:39:58] <igzzz> in this part of the code ? "$('.articles-col-wrapper').on('click', '#btn-del-col-'+num, function() {..}"
[09:41:02] <igzzz> you mean this is not delegation right?
[09:41:40] <Cork> igzzz: https://jsfiddle.net/wtc5ghqd/
[09:41:47] <Cork> start from that
[09:42:10] <Cork> the each loop should contain ZERO event handlers, meaning no change, no click no anything like that
[09:42:25] <Cork> then work form the clicked/changed element and find what you want from there
[09:42:50] <Cork> (i won't modify jsbin cause it sucks at losing changes if more then one person touches it)
[09:43:18] <digimer> MassDebates: I googled for that string and found a stack exchange that suggested this change (unless I misunderstood it) and it's not working; https://jsfiddle.net/p4dwpztj/2/
[09:43:26] <igzzz> yes but the $('.update-col') is reloaded with the load function
[09:43:37] <Cork> igzzz: you mean you replace it?
[09:43:44] <Cork> if you just replace the content it won't matter
[09:43:59] <igzzz> I replace it
[09:44:14] <Cork> then leave it and replace the content instead
[09:44:41] <igzzz> so i put another div inside
[09:44:46] <Cork> no
[09:44:46] <igzzz> and I replace this div?
[09:44:53] <Cork> just use .html() instead of .replace()
[09:45:00] <Cork> or rather replaceWith()
[09:45:01] <igzzz> I am not using replace
[09:45:05] <igzzz> I am using load
[09:45:14] <Cork> on the update-col?
[09:45:14] <teta> I got an accordeon but don't know how to make it go to the third tab
[09:45:23] <igzzz> What I want is reloading the content because the data in database changes
[09:45:23] <teta> I think they are using this line but not sure
[09:45:24] <teta> $('div', $(searchLeuByYear[currentContentYear])).first().data('accordion').accordion('activate', accordionIdx);
[09:45:31] <teta> but still it's not working
[09:46:01] <igzzz> no I am using load on the parent div, which contain all the "update-col" divs
[09:46:28] <Cork> ah, well then you will have to find the event handlers on that div and extend the selectors to have .update-col in them
[09:46:50] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/wtc5ghqd/1/
[09:47:49] <Birliban> Hi, I got an example from https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/#bloodhound and put it here: https://jsfiddle.net/43qum102/ Could someone pls explain why there is a var "states" declared twice? once as object, once as array... is this valid?
[09:48:15] <igzzz> okay but, will this give separate handler for each update-col div?
[09:48:29] <Cork> Birliban: cause the second one replaces the array with Bloodhound
[09:48:42] <Cork> igzzz: no and that is the point
[09:48:44] <igzzz> because each update-col div has a btn-del-col
[09:48:45] <Cork> it shouldn't
[09:48:56] <Cork> igzzz: doesn't matter
[09:49:18] <igzzz> and when i click on this btn-del-col, I want to remove this particular update-col
[09:49:23] <Cork> sure
[09:49:41] <digimer> ok, I've simplified things as much as I can; https://jsfiddle.net/p4dwpztj/7/
[09:49:51] <Cork> igzzz: $(this).closest('find element parent you want to remove').remove()
[09:49:53] <digimer> simple "alert if div X exists" test, nothing more
[09:50:00] <digimer> and neither alert is firing
[09:50:05] <Cork> if the button exists in the element you want to remove
[09:50:27] <Cork> else .closet('.update-col').find() to find what you want to remove
[09:50:35] <Cork> *closest
[09:50:52] <digimer> https://jsfiddle.net/p4dwpztj/9/  <- simpler still
[09:51:17] <Birliban> Cork: ok, then the data in the array is passed to the object before it is created and then the array is not existent anymore...? is this a common technique?
[09:52:03] <digimer> I must be doing something wrong with jsfiddle
[09:52:14] <Cork> Birliban: no, and it is actually wrong, cause the second var is ignored by the engine
[09:52:42] <Cork> Birliban: i would just write it as https://jsfiddle.net/43qum102/1/
[09:53:56] <Birliban> Cork: ok, but the example works... and it is given by the official twitter typeahead plugin page... bit confusing ;-)
[09:54:30] <Cork> Birliban: what i meant before if it wasn't clear is it should have been: var state = []; state = new Bloodhound();
[09:54:46] <Cork> cause the second time your declaring a variable that is already declared
[09:55:02] <Cork> and depending on how picky the parser is it will complain about that
[09:55:26] <Birliban> Cork: ok, this is clear. Thank you!
[09:55:32] <Sourcey> Hello. https://jsfiddle.net/0te28dsf/ <-- When using the up/down buttons the .on function only seems to randomly working. Whats the reason for this?
[09:55:47] <digimer> https://jsfiddle.net/xrovfvc1/2/  <-  works!!!
[09:56:28] <Cork> Sourcey: https://jsfiddle.net/0te28dsf/1/
[09:56:50] <Sourcey> ah thanks m8
[09:57:42] <igzzz> thank you Cork I'm trying your solution :)
[09:57:56] <Cork> igzzz: good luck
[10:00:46] <digimer> Yay! I can change text!
[10:00:55] * digimer might just advance to level 102 today...
[10:12:41] <igzzz> Cork, is it possible then to pass variables between event handlers?
[10:24:26] <teta> can a mouse click event be created by hand?
[10:24:31] <teta> in jquery
[10:36:03] <Cork> igzzz: why do you need to?
[10:36:21] <Cork> teta: depends on what you want to do with the event
[10:36:24] <teta> Cork: there's a button that does a search
[10:36:36] <Cork> $('button').trigger('click')
[10:37:07] <teta> 'button' would be the id right?
[10:37:22] <Cork> or class or what ever ya
[10:37:26] <igzzz> Cork: because I initialize a croppie when the file input is on change, and then I need to save that croppie when a button is clicked
[10:37:49] <Cork> igzzz: you shouldn't do that by a variable
[10:38:20] <igzzz> by what then?
[10:38:43] <Cork> the click handler should find the input field and grab it it self
[10:39:10] <teta> I think it doesn't have an id
[10:39:11] <teta> <button class="ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all ui-button-text-only" role="button" style="width: 80px;"><span class="ui-button-text">Search</span></button>
[10:39:13] <Cork> i don't remember what the code looked like anymore but if you use variables you end up with the problem that it can get out of state
[10:39:24] <Cork> teta: do you have a parent?
[10:39:33] <Cork> you can make a related search
[10:39:55] <igzzz> it's because the croppie's API uses a variable to initialize a croppie
[10:40:01] <igzzz> https://foliotek.github.io/Croppie/
[10:40:36] <Cork> ok, so you need to initialize the plugin for the image
[10:40:50] <Cork> that will have to be rerun every time you add/remove image elements
[10:40:53] <Cork> it can't be delegated
[10:41:06] <Cork> (unless the plugin has explicit support for that)
[10:41:24] <teta> <div style="display: inline-block; width: 97%; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; border-top: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);"><div style="float: left;">Close dialog after search<input id="qckScCloseCheck" type="checkbox" style="position: relative; top: 3px; left: 3px;"></div><div style="float: right;"><button class="ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all ui-butt
[10:41:30] <teta> -----
[10:41:38] <Cork> teta: could you create a jsfiddle?
[10:42:18] <teta> https://jsfiddle.net/8j1k3khu/
[10:42:37] <teta> I don't see any id, this is 2 levels above
[10:43:18] <Cork> well i was kinda asking for the context
[10:43:28] <Cork> not the same dump you made here
[10:43:39] <Cork> cause ya, you can't target that without context
[10:43:56] <teta> context you mean more surrounding tags?
[10:44:04] <Cork> or how you create it
[10:44:16] <Cork> meaning where does it come from and what is around it
[10:44:27] <Cork> "why does it exist and from where"
[10:47:15] <teta> there is a tag like 5 levels above with an id
[10:47:20] <teta> application from hell :-D
[10:47:44] <Cork> teta: so this content isn't generated by a plugin ex. .dialog() ?
[10:48:00] <Cork> cause if it is you have an entry point right there
[10:48:09] <teta> it's actually a quick search box
[10:48:13] <teta> popup box
[10:48:21] <Cork> ya, but something has to create it
[10:48:29] <StephenS> I'm dynamically appending stuff to html via angularjs, however $().on() stops working
[10:48:30] <Cork> either statically or by script
[10:48:47] <Cork> StephenS: you want to delegate the event handler to a static parent
[10:48:51] <StephenS> https://pastebin.com/RZZVNuiq
[10:49:14] <StephenS> I've tried .delegate() but then neither static or dynamic fields are not working
[10:49:36] <StephenS>  $('.field__input').delegate('input', 'click', function () { ... }
[10:49:40] <StephenS> that was my delegate function
[10:49:43] <Cork> it isnät how it works
[10:49:54] <Cork> when you do element.html() what is element?
[10:50:10] <Cork> you need to run .on on this element
[10:50:33] <StephenS> #content1
[10:50:52] <StephenS> I have <div id="content1"><div bind-unsafe-html="dynaddhtml"></div></div>
[10:50:56] <Cork> $('#content1').on('click', '.field__input', function() {})
[10:50:56] <taplar> are the fields being created with angular?
[10:50:58] <Cork> that will work
[10:50:59] <StephenS> so basically it's inside the content1 id
[10:51:21] <Cork> opps
[10:51:26] <Cork> * $('#content1').on('input', '.field__input', function() {})
[10:51:55] <StephenS> works as a charm!
[10:52:00] <StephenS> taplar, yes
[10:52:11] <taplar> why are you not binding with angular then?
[10:52:38] <StephenS> I would if I knew how :)
[10:52:55] <taplar> you should learn then.  two way binding is one of the main points of using angular
[10:53:39] <taplar> you are incurring all the overhead of your framework, but neglecting using apart of it's core
[10:55:58] <teta> does this look reasonable?                field.style = 'cursor: pointer;text-decoration:underline';
[10:56:17] <Cork> teta: i would recommend not setting style from js
[10:56:37] <Cork> teta: set the style in a class in your stylesheet and add the class to the element when you want the new look
[10:56:56] <Cork> (or through a psudo class depending on if you want something like :hover)
[11:07:11] <teta> Cork: it already has a style
[11:07:16] <teta> that div I mean
[11:07:33] <teta> the only problem is I don't know where it is getting it from
[11:07:42] <teta> how can I view that starting from the debugger?
[11:07:47] <Cork> the more reason to not touch it then
[11:08:30] <igzzz> Cork thanks a lot, now everything works perfectly
[11:09:51] <Cork> igzzz: nice
[11:12:06] <teta> Cork: so I need to remove the two that say       element.style
[11:12:40] <Cork> teta: firstly .style is an object and isn't meant to be set with a string
[11:12:51] <Cork> field.style.cursor = "pointer";
[11:16:06] <StephenS> Cork, when I use data-html="true" in bootstrap, appended button is not showing tooltip
[11:20:19] <teta> Cork: there's actually a function, gonna try commenting it       https://pastebin.com/Q1gg6XBt
[11:22:33] <StephenS> fixed :D
[12:10:26] <Rottbot> hello
[12:11:25] <Rottbot> I am currently attempting to create a date range picker so users can adjust a d3 line charts to whatever date range.
[12:12:14] <Rottbot> I have a mssql server that I am calling data from and converting it to json. I am then using this json result to create the line charts
[12:13:35] <Rottbot> I am not sure how to go about creating the date range picker. I tried creating a get form and using the url parameters in an update function but that is not working. research suggests i use jquery
[12:13:55] <Rottbot> could any one help? I can provide my current source files
[12:26:56] <MikeD_> Rottbot: have you tried the jquery-ui datepicker() ?
[12:30:58] <Rottbot> no I have not
[12:31:12] <Rottbot> could you provide the source MikeD_
[12:31:40] <MikeD_> https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[12:36:25] <Rottbot> MikeD_: the problem i am having is how to update the data that is being pulled from my sql server using the new start and end dates
[12:41:03] <MikeD_> how are you getting that data in the first place?
[12:43:45] <Rottbot> MikeD_:  I am using a php file to connect to my mssql db and using a sql query to pull data..this data is then encoded into json format
[12:44:58] <Rottbot> MikeD_: this is what the results look like if i load my php file: https://pasteboard.co/hItORcHo1.png
[12:46:34] <Rottbot> MikeD_: this is the source code for the php file (minus connection info) https://pasteboard.co/1LQJ0nnPi.png
[12:47:42] <Rottbot> i wish to use a a var where it would say ldate between '$start' AND '$end', which the user would input
[13:24:47] <Rottbot> join #d3
[13:49:00] <digimer> hi again. so I've got my network data in json format and I am trying to figure out how to get the data out of the file. I've got this so far: https://jsfiddle.net/xrovfvc1/4/
[13:49:20] <digimer> for now, I am just trying to alert to show the variable / value pair
[13:49:57] <digimer> not sure if it is fetching the data though, or if I am failing to parse it
[14:08:40] <AwkwardCough> digimer: two things, first check your parenthesis and curlies and second check your if statements
[14:09:58] <AwkwardCough> also the contents of https://www.alteeve.com/an-repo/files/network.json is not valid json
[14:10:06] <digimer> oh
[14:10:09] <digimer> hrm
[14:10:13] * digimer is new to json...
[14:10:49] <digimer> what's wrong with it? I'm looking now but, from what I read, it looks ok (obviously isn't though)
[14:11:15] <AwkwardCough> you have { "name:ens11", ...
[14:11:27] <AwkwardCough> objects are expected to contain a key and a value
[14:11:36] <AwkwardCough> {"name":"ens11",...
[14:11:44] <digimer> oh
[14:11:46] <digimer> *sigh*
[14:11:50] <digimer> thanks, I'll update
[14:12:57] <digimer> can you reload and tell me if it looks right this time?
[14:17:00] <digimer> https://jsfiddle.net/xrovfvc1/6/
[14:17:20] <digimer> latest version, the alert and the rewrite of the id work, but not the part where I try to parse the json
[14:17:40] <taplar> getJSON auto parses
[14:17:56] <digimer> ok, so how do I get at the data?
[14:18:51] <taplar> jsfiddle isn't going to work for you with that endpoint.  you are getting a CORS error
[14:19:05] <digimer> it won't fetch the data from a remote server?
[14:19:05] <taplar> the site you are hitting doesn't allow request like this from ajax
[14:19:11] * digimer doesn't know what CORS error means
[14:19:15] <digimer> ah
[14:19:46] <taplar> there is security mechanisms in place regarding what operations javascript can take against a server
[14:20:06] <digimer> can I asked then; this is where I think I am strugging; -> alert('index: ['+index+'], element: ['+element+']');
[14:20:09] <taplar> many requests from one server to another, through ajax, must be explicitly allowed by the destination server
[14:20:16] <taplar> otherwise, it will reject them for security sake
[14:20:18] <digimer> how do I get the key and value out ?
[14:20:41] * digimer can test locally
[14:21:20] <taplar> your each would be over data.networks
[14:21:31] <taplar> according to the json in that url
[14:21:47] <digimer> ok, let me test
[14:22:12] <taplar> also don't use alerts for debugging.  use console.log() or actually debug
[14:22:54] <digimer> ok, that's working better, index is a digit and I get four alerts (0->3), I just need to sort out how to get the actual data out
[14:22:58] <digimer> OK
[14:23:23] <taplar> element would be each one of the records you have
[14:23:30] <digimer> oh, console.log is a lot less annoying, thanks
[14:23:41] <taplar> so element.name or element.mac, etc
[14:23:50] <digimer> so element.name, element.mac, etc?
[14:24:18] <AwkwardCough> confirmeed digimer and taplar are same user
[14:24:25] <digimer> GOT IT!
[14:24:36] * taplar *coughs*
[14:24:36] <digimer> AwkwardCough: don't insult taplar
[14:24:38] <digimer> :P
[14:37:33] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[14:38:02] <taplar> :)
[15:10:44] <Es0teric> i have a class that constantly keeps sending an ajax request every second, causing a server overload but the ajax is only called once and there is a loop inside of the request
[15:10:53] <Es0teric> how do i make it stop running multiple ajax requests?
[15:11:13] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us the code?
[15:11:35] <Es0teric> i can.. but it wont be a fiddle because i dont know where the multiple requests are coming from
[15:11:54] <taplar> i'm curious what you mean by the loop is inside the request
[15:12:07] <robertmaxrees> ^ heh.  "i have a class that constantly
[15:12:07] <robertmaxrees> keeps sending an ajax request every second
[15:12:28] <robertmaxrees> " followed with "i don't know where the multiple requests are coming from" - i'm totally lost.
[15:13:39] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees, taplar should i just post the whole class or just the method i think is affecting it?
[15:13:41] <Es0teric> the request
[15:13:43] <Es0teric> s
[15:14:13] <taplar> how big is the whole thing?
[15:14:33] <Es0teric> 346 lines
[15:14:54] <taplar> whole thing then
[15:15:04] <Es0teric> however i can post the whole thing and just highlight the method that i think controls the ajax request
[15:15:10] <Es0teric> ok
[15:15:36] <Es0teric> taplar https://kopy.io/vtz4Q#line-134
[15:16:01] <Es0teric> thats where the ajax is happening i believe... but as you can see there is a loop in there
[15:17:44] <robertmaxrees> $(document).ajaxComplete(function() { bp.react.start(); });
[15:18:18] <taplar> hah
[15:18:23] <Es0teric> i commented that out
[15:18:26] <Es0teric> and its still happening
[15:18:29] <robertmaxrees> that start method calls addReactions
[15:18:33] <robertmaxrees> which triggers an ajax call.
[15:18:51] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah i get that
[15:18:57] <Es0teric> but why is it calling so many?
[15:18:58] <robertmaxrees> saveReaction also calls some ajax.
[15:19:13] <digimer> I have this; <input type="hidden" id="say_up" value="Up"/>  -  Can I read this into jquery with 'var say_up = $("#say_up").text;'?
[15:19:19] <Es0teric> saveReaction is only called on click
[15:19:22] <robertmaxrees> digimer .text()
[15:19:23] <Es0teric> this is happening onLoad
[15:19:27] <digimer> and should I be using something other than a hidden input to store variables?
[15:19:34] <digimer> robertmaxrees: ah, thanks
[15:20:04] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric update the paste with whatever you have commented out then.
[15:20:34] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i am saying i just commented out and refreshed and it stopped doing a looped ajax request
[15:20:48] <Es0teric> i just didnt see it initially because my screen took a bit to load
[15:21:19] <taplar> cool.  that line was a bit over reaching for a plugin anyway
[15:21:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:21:33] <taplar> -any- ajax would cause that to execute
[15:21:46] <Es0teric> taplar so what would be my alternative.. i wanted that to load on an infinite scroll plugin
[15:22:04] <taplar> you do that completion logic after your internal calls
[15:22:15] <taplar> but you'd still have to figure out how to break the infinite loop
[15:22:44] <Es0teric> hmmm
[15:22:46] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you'd need to expose a method that you could call to run that refresh logic manually withoput calling ajax.
[15:22:47] <Es0teric> thats a pain
[15:23:13] <robertmaxrees> heh, and the problem you have right now isn't?
[15:23:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:23:24] <digimer> robertmaxrees: hrm, seems to not be working... <input type="hidden" id="say_up" value="Up" />  -  var say_up = $("#say_up").text();
[15:23:25] <Es0teric> so if i create the refresh..
[15:23:30] <digimer> anything obviously wrong with that?
[15:23:39] <robertmaxrees> digimer err, .val()
[15:23:42] <robertmaxrees> not text - sorry.
[15:23:44] <digimer> ah
[15:23:45] <digimer> ok
[15:23:50] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[15:23:50] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees where would i put that refresh logic?
[15:23:53] <digimer> np
[15:24:12] <digimer> \o/
[15:24:39] <digimer> next; is there a better way to store variables in HTML instead of <input type="hidden"> ?
[15:24:45] <taplar> data fields
[15:24:51] <digimer> sample?
[15:25:04] <taplar> <tagName data-mycustomguy="hisvalue">
[15:25:11] <robertmaxrees> or - why store on elements at all?
[15:25:13] <digimer> kk, thanks
[15:25:26] <digimer> robertmaxrees: translation, in this case
[15:25:48] <digimer> we render the page on a user's requested language, and I need a way to pass the translated strings to jquery
[15:26:28] <robertmaxrees> check out a translation lib and see ift hat better suits your needs.
[15:27:18] <digimer> translation is pretty deeply baked into our back end... the strings are already stored (and data inserted into) them by existing modules, but I'll take a look just in case
[15:27:48] <robertmaxrees> frontend libs can still help with formatting and whatnot if you're doing tranmsorms or w/e
[15:28:01] <digimer> looking briefly, it looks like those front-end libs are designed to flip languages on the fly
[15:28:10] <digimer> I only care about it when the page is initially generated
[15:28:20] <digimer> noted
[15:28:25] <digimer> I might well use them later
[15:29:29] <robertmaxrees> lots of them are good for specific methods to handle dates/money/etc.
[15:29:32] <robertmaxrees> but fair enough.
[15:29:59] <digimer> ok, I tried this -> <say_up value="Up">  -  var say_up = $("#say_up").val();   and it didn't work
[15:30:07] <taplar> no no
[15:30:14] <digimer> did I interpret the use of the data fields?
[15:30:20] <taplar> tagName would be some pre-existing element
[15:30:27] <taplar> <div> <p>, whatever
[15:30:30] <digimer> oh
[15:30:37] <taplar> whatever makes sense for your situation
[15:30:54] <taplar> typically it'd be a top level html element representing your logical record
[15:30:54] <digimer> <div id="say_up" value="Up"></div> ?
[15:31:46] <robertmaxrees> input
[15:31:53] <Es0teric> taplar, robertmaxrees if i have a infinite scroll that is occurring on a different js file, how do i "hook" on to it?
[15:32:03] <digimer> no, that's not working..
[15:32:05] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you expose a method
[15:32:20] <Es0teric> ok
[15:32:20] <Es0teric> how
[15:32:37] <taplar> digimer: so let me understand this.  you are wanting to store the different translations on the elements that they will effect?
[15:32:43] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric is this a global method you need?  or on a particular element?
[15:33:42] <digimer> taplar: in this case, the user's language is english and the link state can be "Up" or "Down", so I want to put "Up" and "Down" in the HTML so that I can pull that into variables in jquery to insert into the appropriate columns
[15:33:44] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric because you create a global namespace called "bp"  that you could pop a "refresh" method onto.
[15:33:45] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees particular element
[15:33:52] <digimer> not sure if that answers the question
[15:33:55] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees wait wait what?
[15:34:01] <robertmaxrees> window.bp  = window.bp  || {};
[15:34:05] <taplar> so what does the element look like now?
[15:34:05] <Es0teric> i would rather do bp.react.refresh()
[15:34:23] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://kopy.io/vtz4Q#line-2
[15:34:24] <digimer> <div id="say_up" value="#!string!js_0001!#">
[15:34:27] <digimer> woops
[15:34:34] <digimer> one sec
[15:34:43] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric why in the world are you reserving a name in the global space if it's only for a particular element?
[15:34:50] <Es0teric> i didnt do that
[15:34:53] <digimer> <div id="say_up">Up</div>
[15:35:01] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees this is a fork of a project
[15:35:05] <Es0teric> that i improved on
[15:35:14] <digimer> which I try to read with; var say_up = $("#say_up").val();
[15:35:23] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric 'kay...  either way, you have a global object there you can attack to.
[15:35:25] <taplar> <div id="say_up" data-en="Up" data-sp="Up in spanish"></div>
[15:35:41] <taplar> $('#say_up').data('en')
[15:35:51] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok so if i wanted to do bp.react.refresh() inside of this other js file
[15:36:03] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you can reach that global space anywhere.
[15:36:06] <digimer> taplar: fwiw, I don't need to worry about the language stuff in the jquery
[15:36:10] <robertmaxrees> it's global :)
[15:36:17] <taplar> wha?
[15:36:20] <digimer> I put the proper string in when the HTML is generated
[15:36:30] <taplar> oh, so it's already inside the div then?
[15:36:36] <digimer> ya
[15:36:49] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok i get that but do i take whats in addReactions(); and stuff it in .refresh() ?
[15:36:50] <taplar> so then just get the text()
[15:37:05] <Es0teric> or do i just call addReactions(); in .refresh() ?
[15:37:08] <digimer> that's what I am trying to do, but I can't seem to sort out how to craft the div
[15:37:20] <taplar> <div id="say_up">Up</div>
[15:37:33] <taplar> 'Up' is the text()
[15:37:40] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you declare addReactions on bp.react
[15:37:41] <digimer> oooh
[15:37:46] <digimer> I was still using .val
[15:37:49] <robertmaxrees> so you have bp.react.addReactions()
[15:37:51] <digimer> *sigh*
[15:37:56] <robertmaxrees> and you declare BP as a global object./
[15:37:57] <taplar> val() is for value=""
[15:38:02] <taplar> which is only valid for elements that it is valid for
[15:38:09] <taplar> inputs, selects, etc
[15:38:20] <digimer> would .val work for <div id="say_up" value="Up"> ?
[15:38:23] <taplar> no
[15:38:26] <digimer> ok
[15:38:28] <taplar> see my previous statement
[15:38:35] <digimer> yup, switching now to test
[15:39:07] <digimer> \o/
[15:39:08] <digimer> works!
[15:39:28] <digimer> In my day job, I am pretty good at what I do. But man, trying to learn jquery is back to grade 1
[15:39:41] <digimer> taplar: robertmaxrees thanks, both
[15:39:48] <digimer> I am sure I'll have more questions soon enough
[15:39:50] <robertmaxrees> aces - glad you figured it out :)
[15:40:00] <taplar> you might also review some html guides as well
[15:40:05] <taplar> seems like you have some confusion there
[15:40:25] <digimer> if I had the time, I should probably take a class in this stuff :)
[15:40:38] <digimer> the ever living struggle of time
[15:40:41] <taplar> eh, there are lots of web guides out there
[15:40:57] <digimer> yup, I've been googling madly for the last few days
[15:41:23] <digimer> trick is figuring out which ones are current and correct. I'd run into issues where sample code would fail, and the find out something changed, etc
[15:41:31] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[15:41:33] <digimer> or tutorials that assumes a certain amount of existing knowledge
[15:41:35] <robertmaxrees> try.jquery.com
[15:41:37] <digimer> oh, noted
[15:41:39] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:45:34] <digimer> oh, the content of the <div> are printed on screen
[15:45:41] <digimer> is there a simple way to hide them?
[15:46:11] * digimer had used <input type="hidden" ... > to hide the data from the screen before
[15:46:23] <taplar> you don't want them to be visible?
[15:46:28] <digimer> no
[15:46:42] <digimer> I just wanted to have the strings somewhere that jquery could pick them up
[15:47:01] <digimer> basically, trying to pass data from the back-end tool that generated the HTML to jquery
[15:47:11] <taplar> what is jquery going to use them for?
[15:47:14] <digimer> jquery will display the data as/when needed
[15:47:37] <digimer> taplar: in this case, jquery fills in a table show if the network link is up or down
[15:48:07] <taplar> so why not put that as a data field on that element instead?
[15:48:09] <digimer> I'll share the code, one sec
[15:49:12] <digimer> https://jsfiddle.net/5m6xd9f8/
[15:49:47] <digimer> the "Up" and "Down" strings are used multiple times. It felt like it made the HTML overly large to put the strings into all elements
[15:50:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5m6xd9f8/1/
[15:50:26] <taplar> look at the header td
[15:51:02] <digimer> ooooh
[15:51:03] <digimer> cute
[15:51:52] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5m6xd9f8/2/
[15:52:19] <taplar> $('#network_status').find('thead').find('.status').data('up')
[15:52:29] <taplar> err
[15:52:31] <taplar> r/status/state
[15:52:57] * digimer reads...
[15:56:17] <digimer> \o/
[15:56:20] <digimer> much cleaner
[15:56:26] <Es0teric> yes i did robertmaxrees -> [03:37 PM] •  « robertmaxrees » Es0teric you declare addReactions on bp.react
[15:57:01] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric and bp is a global object.
[15:57:12] <Es0teric> =yes
[15:57:40] <robertmaxrees> >.> so what's the question?
[15:57:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:59:00] <digimer> taplar: thanks again, I think this is enough for today... tomorrow, polling!
[15:59:51] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees should i add a alias to addReactions which would be refresh
[15:59:57] <Es0teric> thats the question
[16:00:00] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you don't need to.
[16:00:07] <robertmaxrees> it's already globally available.
[16:00:13] <Es0teric> hmm
[16:18:48] <rhelic> I have an ASP.Net that's populating my content area with AJAX calls, if I want something to fire everytime a particular content is loaded whats the best way, Im currently using this and its not firing   $('#listDashboards').off().on('loaded', function () {
[16:18:55] <rhelic> I also tried 'ready'
[16:19:37] <taplar> ideally the ajax call that is loading it would call whatever logic when it is done
[16:21:57] <rhelic> taplar: well it loads HTML, and I need to fire a click event on something within that content
[16:22:52] <taplar> you can do that from the complete of an ajax request, just like other places
[16:23:13] <rhelic> I have a work around, thanks :)
[17:36:02] <OnTheRocks> hello
[17:36:11] <OnTheRocks> https://pastebin.com/kH1kEVTm
[17:36:29] <OnTheRocks> Uncaught TypeError: $.ajax is not a function
[17:36:40] <OnTheRocks> why i am getting that error?
[17:39:44] <robertmaxrees> slim doesn't include ajax
[17:40:36] <robertmaxrees> OnTheRocks
[17:41:39] <OnTheRocks> what?
[17:41:50] <robertmaxrees> you're using a slim build of jquery.
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't include ajax.
[17:42:04] <robertmaxrees> use a normal build.
[17:44:40] <OnTheRocks> i used that basic template of bootstrap v4
[17:45:02] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap v4 is pre-release.  and that doesn't change that it's using jquery slim :)
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> use a full version of jquery and you'll get ajax.
[17:45:14] <OnTheRocks> but i changed to the bootstrap v3 and updated the links to scripts and now worked well
[17:45:31] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with bootstrap, really :(
[17:45:56] <OnTheRocks> how do you mean with that?
[17:45:59] <OnTheRocks> why?
[17:46:20] <OnTheRocks> what do you mean?
[17:46:34] <robertmaxrees> because they're using a slim version of jquery.  if you just swapped that link to use a regular build, it'd be fine.
[17:46:47] <OnTheRocks> ok
[17:46:52] <OnTheRocks> i understood
[17:46:52] <robertmaxrees> whatever floats your boat :)
[17:47:08] <OnTheRocks> Uncaught Error: Bootstrap tooltips require Tether
[17:47:18] <OnTheRocks> know i get that error

[20:33:02] <digimer> question; I have a json file being read from my server
[20:33:11] <digimer> I left the browser open and powered off the server
[20:33:41] <digimer> when it booted back up later, the jquery seemed to stop reading the json file and is using some cached data
[20:34:00] <digimer> I even deleted the json file from the server and verified that the browser can't read it anymore
[20:34:33] <digimer> but the jquery seems to think it can still read it... I did a shift+reload and it sees the old data
[20:34:58] <digimer> is there a way to tell jquery to not use caches of json files?
[20:35:58] <digimer> oh, it finally reported no data
[20:38:05] <digimer> is this still recommended; $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });
