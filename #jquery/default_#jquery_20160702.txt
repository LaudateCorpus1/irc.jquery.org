[01:36:29] <dopie> whats the difference from   var $header = $("body > header").prependTo("body");
[01:36:35] <dopie> to
[01:36:52] <dopie>   var $header = $("header").prependTo("body");
[03:24:30] <acetakwas> For some reason, call $.ready with anonymous functions doesn't work for me
[03:24:38] <acetakwas> It does work for named functions.
[03:24:45] <acetakwas> Why is this?
[04:48:40] <lulul> good morning guys i need a bit of help with a js https://jsfiddle.net/2oroybk0/34/ when i delete a row the index continues to increment and i would to restart it from 1 instead
[04:49:06] <WhirledPress> Good evening all. This is a weird question, but does anyone know if there is a reference of jquery methods that do not return the jquery object?
[04:52:17] <WhirledPress> it looks like you are manually incrementing a variable called RowsIndex rather than using the count of rows or the index of rows
[04:52:42] <WhirledPress> but in your delete rows function, you never re-index
[04:53:08] <WhirledPress> either stop tracking the index manually or reindex every time you delete a row
[04:54:20] <lulul> and if i would like to have an automatic index any advice on how to achieve it ? :D
[05:01:02] <WhirledPress> use the .index() method in jquery?
[05:01:21] <WhirledPress> also, I don't think you can have all your inputs with the same name, can you?
[05:02:24] <WhirledPress> in other words in .rows tr.row td you have "input name='index'" which uses the name "index" which, if not already reserved should be...
[05:10:26] <lulul> WhirledPress: yes i do not have each input has a different name.
[05:10:46] <lulul> WhirledPress: also in the final version i want to make the id of the input  in the form name_index
[05:18:06] <WhirledPress> lulul, I would first move away for using reserved words or words that sound like reserved words to start. It gets confusing when you use a variable named index and you have the method .index() and the general concept of an index, for example. Which index are you referring to?
[05:22:05] <lulul> Whiskey: you are correct i will change it to something else
[05:43:07] <WhirledPress> I just can't get jsfiddle to work any more. UGG.
[05:44:29] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ufx79Le8/4/  I just get these weird errors like {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[06:17:49] <WhirledPress> lulul, try something more like this: https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ufx79Le8/7/
[06:18:11] <WhirledPress> Not the best ever, but it works and it's css aria safe-ish.
[09:25:42] <Ales> hey, i have <select> <option> and whenever i load file for first time it stores the value choice like that :  var choice = goldtype.val();. But it user selects other option it will won't change
[09:28:12] <darkling> You probably want to add some code to the change event to trigger when the value is changed.
[09:34:30] <Ales> Can anyone help me with logic? i am getting some data from db with php, then i use json_encode. Those are exchange rates, so there are 4 indexes in aarray. all of them are exchange rates and i need to choose one from array depending on user choice from <select> in html. How do i grab just one value from the array using js/jquery?
[09:35:53] <sillyslux> Ales show in a fiddle
[09:36:18] <Ales> ok will take some time sec sillyslux
[09:48:31] <Ales> here it is https://jsfiddle.net/Lqd9vjnh/

[11:19:47] <cyource> Hi everyone; I'm trying to use http://viralpatel.net/blogs/dynamically-shortened-text-show-more-link-jquery/ with my blog https://cyource.me, but when I press the more button - it hides all the content instead of expanding.
[11:23:31] <cyource> Ah, its due to the paragraph tags in post.content
[14:06:12] <printForever> hi!
[14:06:26] <printForever> I was looking at this line of code... <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/vendor/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
[14:07:19] <printForever> and what I deduced by looking at it came in a form of a question - is it possible to load entire chunknks of HTML/CSS and jQ into a page with a single url?
[14:07:47] <printForever> So, basically, the idea behind it was, to load 2 CSS files in the head. That can be done with append.
[14:08:13] <printForever> And add 5 JS scripts to the end of the body tag, with append as well.
[14:08:56] <printForever> I'm thinking out loud here, but... It would start with document.ready, right?
[14:09:09] <printForever> Then I would call a function that would append to head and to body.
[14:09:18] <printForever> right?
[14:15:28] <sillyslux> printForever, if you mean, start with an practically empty index.html, put only one <script src="doAll.js"></script> tag in it, then yes, you can do that
[14:15:48] <printForever> sillyslux, just started building the thing
[14:15:58] <decx> how does that relate to that first line
[14:16:06] <sillyslux> that's a good exercise
[14:16:10] <printForever> oh... I didn't know how to call them
[14:16:14] <printForever> after created
[14:16:44] <printForever> window.jQuery || document.write will initiate the script in the HTML
[14:17:09] <decx> that just checks if the first statement is true
[14:17:14] <decx> you can do that with anything
[14:17:49] <decx> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators
[14:18:27] <printForever> no
[14:18:32] <printForever> the first statement is Bool
[14:18:51] <printForever> it checkds to see if jQuery is on the page or document.write
[14:19:12] <sillyslux> that's not bool
[14:19:36] <sillyslux> that's falsy/truethy
[14:19:42] <printForever> :))))
[14:19:43] <printForever> ok
[14:24:24] <sillyslux> what are the reasons against it?
[14:24:32] <sillyslux> seo comes to my mind...
[14:24:58] <sillyslux> anything else?
[14:25:31] <printForever> against?
[14:25:36] <printForever> oh...
[14:25:44] <printForever> I'm loading a testing functionality for clients
[14:25:51] <printForever> its not default page content
[14:26:04] <printForever> it just extends the website with a chat feature
[14:26:27] <drej> seo , page load, accessibility, older browsers, maintainability, reliance on javscript for everything
[14:26:28] <drej> etc
[14:26:37] <drej> unless you're building a purpose-driven single page application with angular or react or something
[14:26:53] <sillyslux> drej dan :)
[14:46:29] <Ales> hey, how to i used json_encode to convert from db to array and here is my output. But this isn't same as var array = ["0.5","1.5",3.5"] because it is not working. Here is json output: array(1) { [0]=> array(4) { [0]=> string(3) "0.5" [1]=> string(3) "1.5" [2]=> string(3) "3.5" [3]=> string(1) "$" } }
[14:48:03] <sillyslux> that is not json
[14:49:51] <Ales> sillyslux how not i get output this from it exchange= <?php echo json_encode($exchangeRates);?>, console.log(exchange);
[14:51:32] <sillyslux> try http://jsonlint.com/ and see for yourself
[14:51:42] <Ales> sillyslux, look i fixed previous issue with jquery http://codepen.io/pghiran/pen/QEvRjW but it only works on static array..
[14:54:56] <sillyslux> that looks quite complicated
[14:57:08] <Ales> it's working but not working on array from db..
[14:57:12] <Ales> only if i set static
[14:57:17] <printForever> how to call jQuery though JS with an url?
[14:57:18] <Ales> and yes it is complicated, what would u change?
[14:57:27] <printForever> file > file > url
[14:58:02] <printForever> basically, append without append
[14:58:37] <printForever> to elaborate...
[14:58:45] <printForever> how to call jQuery url with javascript?
[14:59:51] <printForever> JavaScript has no import, include, or require.
[14:59:53] <printForever> oh well
[15:00:19] <sillyslux> there's $.getScript
[15:00:28] <printForever> but that is JQ method
[15:00:37] <sillyslux> you want vanilla-js?
[15:00:43] <printForever> yup
[15:00:49] <printForever> I have a pure HTML page
[15:00:50] <sillyslux> document.createElement('script')
[15:00:55] <printForever> and I want to add css...
[15:01:00] <printForever> right
[15:01:48] <printForever> document.createElement('script.js');
[15:01:50] <printForever> right?
[15:01:55] <sillyslux> haha
[15:01:56] <sillyslux> no
[15:02:03] <printForever> :(
[15:02:16] <printForever> document.createElement('https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js');
[15:02:24] <sillyslux> var myscript = document.createElement('script');myscript.src='script.js'
[15:02:31] <printForever> ah
[15:02:58] <sillyslux> myscript.addEventListener('load')
[15:03:18] <sillyslux> document.head.appendChild(myscript)
[15:04:00] <printForever> TypeError: Not enough arguments to EventTarget.addEventListener.
[15:04:10] <printForever> for the load line
[15:09:37] <printForever> nope, can't get it to work
[15:17:41] <sillyslux> myscript.addEventListener('load',function(){//script is now loaded//}) or callback or whatever
[15:21:34] <printForever> ok
[15:25:33] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/mhFmVKH6
[15:25:46] <printForever> line 11 wont work
[15:33:57] <sillyslux> http://pastebin.com/wmQ6tjjk
[15:34:30] <printForever> thank you sillyslux
[15:34:52] <printForever> I couldn't write it like you did
[15:35:04] <printForever> however, for some reason, the jQuery isn't loading
[15:35:39] <sillyslux> if (i + 1 = len ) { is very wrong
[15:35:55] <printForever> :( i know
[15:35:56] <sillyslux> maybe you meant if ( len == i + 1 ) {
[15:36:02] <printForever> right!
[15:36:28] <printForever> sometimes jQuery loads and sometime it does not
[15:36:59] <sillyslux> it's always loaded
[15:37:12] <sillyslux> do you sometimes get Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined?
[15:37:13] <printForever> ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[15:37:39] <printForever> select2....min.js (line 1, col 180)
[15:37:52] <sillyslux> that's because select2.full.min.js depends on jquery
[15:37:52] <printForever> god knows what that is
[15:38:04] <printForever> that means its not loaded?
[15:38:09] <sillyslux> and is quicker loaded than jquery
[15:38:14] <printForever> ah...
[15:38:17] <sillyslux> a racecondition
[15:38:20] <printForever> can I delay them, like a cascade?
[15:38:33] <printForever> or with an if
[15:38:35] <sillyslux> well.. there's the onload event
[15:38:38] <printForever> or with a load
[15:39:19] <guest____> Hey
[15:39:24] <printForever> the way you wrote the script, and thank you for that, encapsulates the paths
[15:39:36] <printForever> so the same time the the previous path is written, it just adds another one
[15:39:37] <evhTap> Hey
[15:39:58] <evhTap> What're we discussing?
[15:40:19] <printForever> long story
[15:40:19] <sillyslux> don't tell printForever :P
[15:40:32] <sillyslux> evhTap, it's jquery
[15:40:36] <sillyslux> but without jquery
[15:40:39] <printForever> short answer > sillyslux's got it
[15:40:56] <evhTap> got what?
[15:41:14] <evhTap> All this is making less sense than Donald Trump
[15:41:15] <sillyslux> evhTap, need some?
[15:41:20] <sillyslux> got some ;)
[15:41:32] <evhTap> some what, bruh?
[15:41:34] <printForever> sillyslux wrote this http://pastebin.com/wmQ6tjjk
[15:41:39] <printForever> as a helping hand
[15:41:43] <sillyslux> it'll make you reaaally great
[15:42:00] <sillyslux> but psst.. don't tell
[15:42:01] <printForever> the issue is that some scripts are loaded faster than jQUery
[15:42:20] <printForever> :(
[15:42:24] <evhTap> What does the script in the link do?
[15:42:32] <systemfault> What's wrong with.. you know, script tags.
[15:42:34] <sillyslux> ah yes there was some jquery involved :D
[15:42:48] <decx> ghetta require lol
[15:42:52] <sillyslux> i knew it!
[15:42:55] <decx> ghetto
[15:43:01] <evhTap> WHat's goin' on?
[15:43:01] <sillyslux> lol
[15:43:14] <printForever> I'm trying to create a variation on the current file
[15:43:19] <decx> write script tags bra
[15:43:29] <sillyslux> yes
[15:43:29] <printForever> so I would load all the scripts and everything with 1 script call

[15:43:44] <sillyslux> i like bra so much more than bro
[15:43:44] <decx> one of those
[15:43:45] <printForever> I've got the resources url's and they are loaded

[15:44:00] <printForever> or bruh
[15:44:08] <evhTap> @printForever Help me out man
[15:44:17] <printForever> evhTap how?
[15:44:31] <evhTap> I don't understand anything that's happening
[15:44:35] <printForever> ok
[15:44:50] <printForever> can you open this? http://pastebin.com/wmQ6tjjk
[15:44:56] <evhTap> I did
[15:44:57] <sillyslux> i'm trying to learn webpack
[15:44:59] <sillyslux> and react
[15:45:04] <evhTap> But I didn't understand it
[15:45:05] <printForever> it writes script tags in body
[15:45:13] <evhTap> Sorry?
[15:45:24] <printForever> -_-
[15:45:42] <printForever> what are you sorry about?
[15:45:50] <evhTap> I don't understand
[15:45:53] <printForever> do you see the file paths?
[15:45:59] <evhTap> Yeah I do
[15:46:01] <printForever> do you see the forEach?
[15:46:02] <printForever> so?
[15:46:08] <printForever> where is the problem?
[15:46:08] <evhTap> They load a couple scripts
[15:46:12] <printForever> no
[15:46:24] <printForever> they append SCRIPT tag in BODY
[15:46:29] <evhTap> Hold on I got it
[15:46:36] <evhTap> They add the script tags in the body
[15:46:40] <printForever> sillyslux, please... dont leave me
[15:46:41] <evhTap> Oh cool
[15:46:46] <evhTap> Thanks for explaining
[15:46:46] <sillyslux> haha
[15:46:59] <jdelers>  for some code like this  <script type="text/javascript" src="lib/js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>  i get a warning "unresolved file references "
[15:47:12] <evhTap> What is the poit of that tho?
[15:47:12] <jdelers> i use web storm
[15:47:18] <printForever> jdelers, check if the file is in the lib/js folder
[15:47:47] <printForever> sillyslux, can you help me out how to load them after the jquery is loaded?
[15:47:56] <jdelers> printForever:  it exisits
[15:48:06] <printForever> jdelers, then you're not targeting it correctly
[15:48:08] <sillyslux> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Methods_2
[15:48:47] <printForever> sillyslux? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[15:49:53] <sillyslux> yes, Mutator methods and Accessor methods
[15:49:58] <sillyslux> lots and very useful
[15:50:00] <jdelers> printForever:  haa.. no, can u look at this repo https://github.com/ShekharReddy4/openmrs-contrib-atlas-node/tree/master/public/lib/js  the file exists and i am referring it correctly
[15:50:25] <jdelers> <script type="text/javascript" src="lib/js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
[15:50:33] <printForever> jdelers, you need to learn how to work the file system... Windows Explorer, files, folders, copy, paste...
[15:50:39] <printForever> then you should move to targeting files
[15:51:04] <printForever> God knows where the file is and in what relative path its to the actual file
[15:51:05] <sillyslux> jdelers, 'i get a warning "unresolved file references "'
[15:51:15] <sillyslux> is that in the browser or in webstorm?
[15:51:29] <jdelers> webstorm
[15:51:42] <sillyslux> i have no webstorm :(
[15:52:09] <printForever> jdelers, sync your folder in webstorm
[15:52:15] <printForever> check the file path
[15:52:21] <printForever> thats the problem
[15:52:38] <printForever> sillyslux, I don't get what Mutators and Accessor methods have to do with this?
[15:52:57] <printForever> am I in wrong to check if jQuery is loaded?
[15:53:01] <sillyslux> there's forEach as an accessor
[15:53:30] <printForever> and I've opened that
[15:53:32] <printForever> and I've read it
[15:53:35] <printForever> and now what?
[15:53:47] <sillyslux> no, Iteration methods
[15:53:56] <printForever> what?
[15:54:06] <printForever> you're confusing the **** out of me
[15:54:07] <sillyslux> what what?
[15:54:16] <printForever> what iterration methods now?
[15:54:20] <sillyslux> so you learn what to do with arrays
[15:54:27] <printForever> I know what to do with arrays
[15:54:31] <printForever> I don't know how to check
[15:54:34] <printForever> if jQuery is loaded or not
[15:54:34] <sillyslux> instead of for(bla)
[15:55:08] <printForever> after array[0] I will check if jQuery is loaded
[15:55:11] <sillyslux> if you have to check if it's loaded, you do that in the onload eventlistener
[15:55:17] <printForever> if(!window.jQuery)
[15:55:45] <sillyslux> not *in but *through the onload event
[15:55:54] <sillyslux> *with
[15:56:51] <printForever> almost no idea what you're trying to say to me
[15:57:35] <sillyslux> you need resources=[jquery] and plugins=[select2.full] when resources are loaded you load plugins
[15:57:58] <sillyslux> that's ghetto require
[15:58:12] <printForever> sorry, I trully am sorry
[15:58:15] <printForever> but I don't follow
[15:58:16] <printForever> at all
[15:58:19] <sillyslux> how so?
[15:58:47] <printForever> what are now plugins=[select2.full] from where did they come from>
[16:00:12] <sillyslux> that's just a proposal
[16:00:30] <printForever> and I have no idea what you're saying, but thank you for the proposal
[16:00:35] <sillyslux> to make sure jquery is loaded before any plugins that depend on it
[16:01:01] <sillyslux> look
[16:01:05] <printForever> I have this idea
[16:01:13] <printForever> to load just jQuery
[16:01:18] <printForever> and after its loaded
[16:01:19] <printForever> check if(!window.jQuery)
[16:01:25] <printForever> and then add rest of the scripts
[16:01:30] <sillyslux> yes
[16:01:32] <printForever> that makes sense to me
[16:02:33] <sillyslux> so you create the jquery script tag and let it load, it has to have the eventlistener 'load'
[16:02:51] <sillyslux> in that function you load the other scripts
[16:03:01] <printForever> right
[16:03:12] <printForever> and where do I check if jQuery is loaded?
[16:03:19] <printForever> do I need to?
[16:03:21] <printForever> I think I do
[16:05:36] <sillyslux> well you can do the check but it's really unnecessary
[16:06:31] <sillyslux> after your script tag has loaded jquery.js you can expect it to be there
[16:07:07] <sillyslux> just continue with creating the other script tags
[16:07:28] <sillyslux> in the onload function of the first
[16:07:59] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/kGZD93F6
[16:08:39] <sillyslux> that looks good
[16:08:47] <printForever> does not fire  :(
[16:08:47] <sillyslux> does it throw any errors?
[16:09:38] <printForever> yes, it throws errors, but the script tags were not created
[16:09:39] <sillyslux> ah script.onload should be loadjquery.onload
[16:09:42] <printForever> even for jquery
[16:10:10] <printForever> F-in A!
[16:10:12] <printForever> right on!
[16:19:25] <printForever> ReferenceError: emailjs is not defined3
[16:19:27] <printForever> one more left
[16:19:29] <printForever> just one more
[16:24:49] <printForever> sillyslux, what does onLoad do?
[16:24:57] <printForever> sorry
[16:24:59] <printForever> loaded.push(path);
[16:25:14] <printForever> is loaded checking for url path
[16:25:36] <printForever> or if the file that was added via path loaded?
[16:27:03] <sillyslux> loaded is just an empty array and whenever a script *was loaded, it's path will be noted in `loaded`
[16:27:31] <printForever> ah...
[16:27:40] <printForever> so it does not check if its actually loaded
[16:27:42] <printForever> and initiated
[16:27:49] <printForever> it just checks for file path
[16:27:52] <sillyslux> onLoad is the function that's executed after the script was loaded
[16:28:01] <printForever> :/
[16:28:14] <printForever> which script? the one that is referenced in the path?
[16:28:16] <arc_> i am curious what the actual purpose of loaded is
[16:28:18] <sillyslux> there are no checks anywhere
[16:28:25] <sillyslux> yes
[16:28:27] <sillyslux> path
[16:28:34] <printForever> so it just checks for the url
[16:28:39] <printForever> nothing else
[16:28:46] <sillyslux> no purpose arc_
[16:28:47] <arc_> it seems like you just push the urls into it and never use it for anything
[16:28:56] <arc_> heh o
[16:28:57] <sillyslux> yes
[16:28:58] <arc_> ok*
[16:29:10] <printForever> then... why do we need it?
[16:29:31] <sillyslux> to show you a potential usecase for the onload event
[16:29:53] <printForever> but...
[16:29:56] <sillyslux> you found another use case
[16:29:59] <printForever> onload event does nothing
[16:30:03] <printForever> :(
[16:30:08] <printForever> I mean
[16:30:09] <sillyslux> it does
[16:30:13] <printForever> it just checks if the file path is OK
[16:30:16] <printForever> and even if its not
[16:30:18] <sillyslux> loaded shows me what scripts are loaded
[16:30:21] <printForever> it will go about its business
[16:30:26] <printForever> right
[16:30:41] <sillyslux> again, there are no checks
[16:30:46] <printForever> but onload event can just parse out <script> tag with nothing in src
[16:30:49] <printForever> ok
[16:30:54] <printForever> thats what I asked... thanks
[16:30:56] <printForever> so...
[16:31:06] <printForever> is there a way to introduce a failsafe or check?
[16:31:26] <printForever> is there a way to trigger next for loop only after window.jQuery is true?
[16:31:50] <arc_> this seems like kind of a weird way to do this. i think i would have made a function to create a script element and load js file into it, and passed urls as arguments
[16:31:56] <arc_> but i guess it doesn't matter at this point
[16:32:14] <printForever> arc_ is there a way to trigger next for loop only after window.jQuery is true?
[16:32:42] <arc_> what do you mean next for loop
[16:32:52] <arc_> there is only one
[16:32:55] <printForever> trigger next "for" loop, go over another one
[16:33:10] <printForever> there are as many as there are array[i]
[16:33:19] <printForever> thats why "for" is used
[16:33:57] <arc_> well, you can test window.jQuery and break if true
[16:34:18] <arc_> or continue, depending on what you actually mean here
[16:34:33] <arc_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/continue
[16:34:35] <printForever> thats what I did
[16:34:38] <arc_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break
[16:34:43] <arc_> ok
[16:34:46] <printForever> thanks for the links, I'm aware
[17:46:05] <xenaxon> hi
[17:46:15] <xenaxon> has anybody worked with jquery validation plugin?
[17:46:48] <xenaxon> I want to do the validation on a function call, not on submit button press
[17:46:53] <xenaxon> not sure how to do that
[17:56:10] <phelix> Any ideas why I would be getting this error? TypeError: Cannot read property 'each' of undefined ?
[17:56:18] <phelix> $.each(values, function(key, value) { } is the each
[17:56:31] <phelix> values is an object
[18:00:12] <systemfault> jquery is not on the page... or you use noConflict or something similar.
[18:01:52] <phelix> on that page I can console.log(values) and it returns the object.. I can look in the header and see that jquery is on the page
[18:53:26] <topohomy> How should I add the jquery formatted tags to the database?
[18:53:41] <topohomy> Is there anyway to fetch the data just like the submitted forms?
