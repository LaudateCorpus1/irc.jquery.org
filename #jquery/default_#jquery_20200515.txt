[18:56:30] <destramic> https://jsfiddle.net/destramic/7u85eaz6/6/    im having a tiny problem with date picker if anyone can tell me why please....if you click change date the date picker will appear, but then when you click anywhere on the calender but a date it activates the change date click
[20:16:23] <Jaseinatl> destramic, did you get it figured out?
[20:21:39] <Jaseinatl> when events bubble, they occur on the most embedded element first and then bubble up from there? In other words, if you capture the event on both an anchor and the div that contains the anchor, can the anchor element set a global variable before it's parent gets the bubbled event?
[23:59:42] <sydbarret> Is there a quick way to replicate this page? https://www.smileobsession.site/
