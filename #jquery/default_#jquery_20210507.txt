[07:56:47] <Cork> O_o seriously "watch this video to get my question"?!?
[07:56:56] <Cork> that's a new one...
[08:04:02] <pavonia> lol
[18:03:25] <Fus_ion> Hello
[18:03:47] <Fus_ion> How are your lives going
[18:03:58] <robertmaxrees> okayish.  yours?
[18:04:11] <Fus_ion> half hell and half ok
[18:04:58] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[18:05:24] <Fus_ion> jquery vs react...
[18:05:29] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[18:05:34] <Fus_ion> pick one
[18:05:39] <robertmaxrees> what's the job?
[18:05:57] <robertmaxrees> two completely different tools for two completely different scenarios :)
[18:06:44] <Fus_ion> Which ones better in your opinion. (i think jquery is because of its flexibility)
[18:06:59] <robertmaxrees> neither.  you cannot compare them.
[18:07:19] <Fus_ion> Ok... then give me something to compare it to
[18:07:24] <robertmaxrees> compare what to?
[18:07:26] <robertmaxrees> react?
[18:07:31] <Fus_ion> yeah
[18:07:36] <robertmaxrees> angular, vue.
[18:08:14] <Fus_ion> i think that react is still outclassed
[18:08:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:08:26] <robertmaxrees> wrong place for this convo :)
[18:08:42] <Fus_ion> which channel?
[18:08:53] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript maybe?
[18:10:09] <Fus_ion> Yes it may be the place to go.
[23:13:30] <sydbarret> how do you hide or unhide nav options depending on the current page loaded?
[23:55:23] <pavonia> Usually the server handles that
