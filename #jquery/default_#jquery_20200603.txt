[01:22:54] <Cork> Woet: you can't trigger it again
[01:22:59] <Woet> Cork: alright, cheers
[01:23:10] <Cork> Woet: if $(func) is called after the document is ready, nothing is stored
[01:23:25] <Cork> if it is before it is stored in an internal readyList variable, but it isn't exposed
[01:24:11] <Cork> simplest solution is to just store the function in a varaible and then do $(var)
[01:26:51] <Woet> will do, thanks again

[05:23:37] <gnstaxo> With the following hierarchy (https://pastebin.com/Z1naaeFr) I'm trying to add a click handler to every #button to hide() its parent with the class .Hilo with this line: $(this).parent().parent().hide(). This seems to work, but only for the first occurrence of #button.
[05:24:56] <gnstaxo> By the way. I tried .parent(".Hilo") that but doesn't work...
[05:25:11] <gnstaxo> but that*
[05:28:16] <Cork> gnstaxo: id is to identify unique elements
[05:28:19] <Cork> for groups use classes
[05:30:07] <gnstaxo> Cork: thank you
[05:30:48] <Cork> gnstaxo: also i would recommend binding a delegated event handler to a static parent
[05:31:06] <Cork> that way you don't have to add one handler for each block
[05:31:37] <Cork> and finally, don't use <a> for none url actions, use <button> (you can style them to look like text)
[05:45:42] <gnstaxo> like a .Container?
[05:59:45] <Cork> gnstaxo: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[06:34:00] <gnstaxo> thanks gain, i've just done it that way
[06:34:28] <gnstaxo> again*
[06:57:27] <manornk> Hi, Is there any plugin where I can select FROM-TO part of video that I will crop in jquery. Something like instagram does or similar websites.
[06:58:13] <Cork> doubt it, jquery is for dom manipulation not video editing (canvas)
[06:59:15] <manornk> Cork, Any ideas where I can check for something like this. Basically I need to choose from - to on something like a slider
[06:59:48] <Cork> never needed it so no, not sure you will find a ready made package for it either
[07:00:03] <manornk> Thanks
[07:03:12] <gnstaxo> How do I get the elements at the same level of $(this)? Its brothers so to speak
[07:03:33] <Cork> https://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[07:03:56] <Cork> if you by level mean elements in the same parent
[07:09:34] <gnstaxo> Thanks
[20:54:58] <linurandy> hello

[21:50:03] <V7> Hey all o/
[21:50:18] <V7> https://paste.ofcode.org/dK5GyNuCZaiifpG6nSqapE Why would this one does not work at the page load, but only from console?
[21:50:55] <V7> Is that because of a page have not loaded, yet?
[21:51:06] <V7> Thus an element is not available
[21:53:37] <V7> Figured out :)
