[05:26:23] <EugenA> trying to get running web page made by other developer, but getting error: TypeError: $ is not a function
[05:26:31] <EugenA> this means - jquery is not loaded, right?
[05:48:20] <Cork> EugenA: yes
[05:48:36] <Cork> EugenA: or .noConflict has been ran on it
[05:49:27] <EugenA> it seems to be a website with requirejs (http://github.com/requirejs), don't understand why jquery is not loaded
[05:49:46] <EugenA> if I open index.hml simply from file system everything is ok
[05:50:05] <EugenA> if I open it from webserver, everything is OK, but jquery
[05:50:39] <Cork> doesn't requirejs require a preprocessing in production?
[05:50:46] <Cork> (don't use it, but i think it does)
[05:51:29] <EugenA> I don't know requirejs...
[05:51:58] <EugenA> what means "preprocessing"?
[05:52:21] <Cork> you need to run a npm command server side to generate the combinated js archive
[06:00:38] <itsgokul> iget this when i do x.toSource (new String("{\"name\":\"LIJU.LS\"}{\"batch\":null,\"centre\":null,\"date\":null,\"attended\":null}"  when i do alert(x.name it returns undefined
[06:00:56] <itsgokul> hlp
[06:06:30] <Cork> uh...
[06:06:42] <Cork> 1. why on earth would you EVER run new String() ???
[06:06:48] <Cork> 2. toSource is mozilla only
[06:07:18] <Cork> 3. toSource doesn't take any arguments
[06:07:36] <Cork> so; what are you trying to do?
[06:12:55] <EugenA> Cork: no, since I can open index.html locally and really everything looks fine
[08:26:29] <AdamPDotty> "What are you trying to do?" - "No, everything looks fine." ...
[08:26:46] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[08:49:15] <KnightsOfNi> Has anything changed in the latest jquery? PHPstorm starts complaining about e.preventDefault() being an unresolved function
[09:04:30] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: unresolved?
[09:04:39] <Cork> not even sure what that is suppose to mean
[09:05:18] <Cork> AdamPDotty: two different users though
[09:06:04] <AdamPDotty> yes, still looked funny
[09:06:37] <AdamPDotty> "unresolved" = "not found" I would expect
[09:07:01] <AdamPDotty> Maybe it does not recognize typeof e .
[09:09:42] <Cork> donno, too little context
[09:10:25] <Uhkis> bad IDE is bad
[09:11:45] <AdamPDotty> yeah, I let it do all the work anyway
[09:19:38] <mar77i> hmm. I need to be compatible with browsers as old as msie8, and I noticed I use https links for some thinigs
[09:21:11] <mar77i> so those things appear to have wildly out of date certs. can I expect the same effect when I add a link tag to <head> on loading? I'd like to continue using the font definition I load.
[09:25:00] <mar77i> seems like I have a better idea.
[09:51:56] <skywater> hi
[09:52:34] <skywater> if i have an input field with id="345 AAA"  Can i call this input field with jquery: $("#345 AAA).text(); ?
[09:52:38] <skywater> it does not seem to work
[09:53:02] <km4> hi guys
[09:54:02] <AdamPDotty> invalid id
[09:54:16] <km4> skywater: you should use one ID, if need some more use class
[09:54:27] <AdamPDotty> fix your markup
[09:54:36] <skywater> its 1 ID km4
[09:54:56] <km4> 1 name id with whitespac ?
[09:57:48] <skywater> fixed my markup
[09:57:49] <skywater> XD
[09:57:53] <skywater> got only 1 name now :)
[09:59:36] <ExeciN> I'm trying to use http://www.dropzonejs.com/ (I assume as intended) but I'm getting a "jQuery.Deferred exception: $(...).dropzone is not a function" error. what am I doing wrong? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VmVdoK?editors=1011#0
[10:03:00] <shoky> ExeciN: you can't include directly from raw.github.com like that
[10:03:10] <shoky> ExeciN: Refused to execute script from 'https://raw.github.com/enyo/dropzone/master/dist/dropzone.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[10:04:12] <shoky> ExeciN: if you remove the dot from raw.github.com (to rawgithub.com) it'll work, but you should host the file yourself or use a cdn
[10:09:03] <ExeciN> shoky: thanks but it still doesn't work
[10:09:45] <ExeciN> I'm hosting the file myself but I was having the same problem so I though I should do an isolated case on codepen
[10:10:19] <skywater> I have a span element <span style="display:none;" class="hiddenArtikelNrForShoppingCart">hello</span>. If in jquery i do this: $(this).find(".hiddenArtikelNrForShoppingCart").text();   then i get empty result. why
[10:13:26] <MassDebates> that is a ridiculous class name
[10:13:46] <shoky> ExeciN: it's working, it's just empty and not styled..  give it a class "dropzone"
[10:14:12] <shoky> ExeciN: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qqQyra?editors=1111
[10:14:30] <MassDebates> class="ThisIsAClassNameThatIsFarTooLongForItsUsagePurposesLikeWTFlmao"
[10:14:41] <shoky> ExeciN: er and also the same github thing for the .css file
[10:15:32] <MikeD_> that's a "self documenting" class name
[10:16:28] <MassDebates> class="HaHaHaFutureDevelopersTryDebuggingOrSelectingThisShitLOLliIlLlI1Ill\|lilIliLiliL\!"
[10:16:55] <MassDebates> hm, that gives me an idea.
[10:17:00] <MassDebates> rb
[10:17:03] <MassDebates> brB*
[10:17:06] <MikeD_> and you definitely need to have a few namespaces prefixing that class too
[10:17:26] <MikeD_> because descendant selectors are for technical guru
[10:19:36] <skywater> ok  but why cant i select the text ??
[10:20:03] <skywater> ArtNrHidden is my namespace now
[10:20:05] <skywater> XD
[10:21:04] <MikeD_> sorry skywater, i wasn't picking on you specifically... my coworkers have institutionalized class names of the form "project-component-sub_component-part_icon"
[10:21:26] <MassDebates> I'm a fan of clean css architecture
[10:21:52] <skywater> i dont care about the name now its more about the freaking technical aspect
[10:21:53] <MassDebates> I'm not a fan at poor attempts at clean css architecture though.
[10:22:05] <MikeD_> skywater: did you have a fiddle to look at?
[10:22:09] <MassDebates> skywater:  have you a fiddle?
[10:22:32] <shoky> ExeciN: you also want  Dropzone.autoDiscover = false;
[10:22:53] <skywater> no i will fiddle it
[10:23:05] <MassDebates> Make sure you record the beautiful sound.
[10:23:09] <shoky> ExeciN: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qqQyra
[10:23:09] <MassDebates> I sure do love fiddles.
[10:24:55] <shoky> ExeciN: so either that or without the dropzone class and styling completely yourself:  https://codepen.io/anon/pen/RoqBQx
[10:25:20] <shoky> ExeciN: or you can just use the auto-discover way with dropzone class
[10:25:42] <skywater> wait i fixed it
[10:25:43] <skywater> XD
[10:25:47] <skywater> woohoo
[10:26:00] <MassDebates> Good now fix your class names
[10:26:03] <MassDebates> for god sakes man lol
[10:26:06] <skywater> hahahha
[10:26:08] <skywater> yes i will
[10:26:12] <skywater> damn i am so bad in classnames
[10:26:21] <MassDebates> You just have too much class.
[10:26:30] <MassDebates> Drop it down for us unsophisticated mumbo jumbos.
[10:26:31] <MikeD_> needs more abbrevs
[10:26:36] <MassDebates> You class act, you !
[10:26:44] <MassDebates> class act; // that's me!
[10:28:00] <MikeD_> when people say "we will have to add some logic to ... " i think they're using the word 'logic' in a way that's scarily similar to 'magic'
[10:28:44] <taplar> 'people' is pretty generic, ;)
[10:28:48] <ExeciN> shoky: cool thanks
[10:28:55] <MassDebates> For what it's worth
[10:28:59] <MassDebates> taplar is pretty darned generic too
[10:29:10] <MassDebates> he's like the knockoff brand of robertmaxrees :P
[10:29:10] <taplar> i prefer yogurt
[10:29:18] <MassDebates> What?
[10:29:24] <taplar> it's a heros reference
[10:29:26] * MassDebates feels things woosh over his hair
[10:29:36] <MassDebates> OMG
[10:29:45] <MassDebates> you mean that AWFULLY overdone tv show?
[10:29:58] <taplar> it was in season 1.  so it was still good at the time
[10:30:09] <MassDebates> oh
[10:30:12] <taplar> and you can't really blame them for the writers strike completely killing it
[10:31:02] <bskud> Hi guys, I have a question about the animation performance.
[10:31:17] <bskud> I wanna know if it's better to use css animation ? or jquery ?
[10:31:24] <bskud> about compatibility, etc etc ..
[10:31:41] <taplar> i'd say if you can use css, use css
[10:32:03] <MassDebates> CSS is lighter
[10:32:15] <bskud> Ok thx
[10:32:36] <MassDebates> bskud:  Make sure that you use animations where animations are appropriate and use transitions where transitions are appropriate
[10:32:38] <bskud> and for select dom for instance, better js or jquery ?
[10:32:47] <MassDebates> I like jquery because it's far easier.
[10:32:49] <taplar> depends
[10:32:57] <taplar> how do you categorize 'better'?
[10:33:02] <bskud> Performance
[10:33:03] <MassDebates> support wise? js
[10:33:06] <MassDebates> js for perf
[10:33:09] <taplar> js is better then
[10:33:13] <bskud> ok
[10:33:16] <MassDebates> HA taplar
[10:33:27] <bskud> MassDebates: you mean animation transition ?
[10:33:34] <bskud> What do you mean ?
[10:33:41] <MassDebates> There's animations and there's transitions
[10:33:48] <MassDebates> #css can help you with all of your juicy #css goodness
[10:34:24] <bskud> ok :D
[10:34:49] <MassDebates> Transitions are often used for tweener animations; typically things in UI like tabs and whatnot. Transitioned from 1 class to another, the class change often being driven by js/jq
[11:18:04] * taplar is now a social pariah
[11:18:54] <MassDebates> Float is by far one of the most interesting CSS properties.
[11:19:03] <taplar> i hate it
[11:19:07] <MassDebates> People don't give it credit for its design elegance tho
[11:19:10] <MassDebates> Why h8 m8
[11:19:19] <taplar> breaks out the contains and crap
[11:19:33] <MassDebates> This ain't a b8 m8 and floats st8 things out if you just w8
[11:19:39] <MassDebates> Sorry.
[11:19:54] <MassDebates> But yeah, floats can be troublesome to manage at times, but really
[11:20:10] <MassDebates> it's simple sophistication at its finest, as much as the term seems oxymoronic.
[11:20:49] <bskud> Massdebates: http://jsfiddle.net/ty02v72q/ no way ? why ?
[11:21:21] <MassDebates> No way what?
[11:21:26] <MassDebates> What am I looking at?
[11:21:33] <bskud> :D
[11:21:34] <taplar> toggle is a jQuery method, not a javascript method
[11:21:40] <taplar> afaik
[11:21:43] <bskud> Nop, it exeists
[11:22:13] <bskud> toggleClass works
[11:22:30] <bskud> So i just want to modify a property
[11:22:33] <taplar> wow, interesting
[11:22:39] <bskud> .D
[11:22:58] <MassDebates> So you're toggling something
[11:23:05] <bskud> yep
[11:23:12] <MassDebates> What are you toggling?
[11:23:13] <bskud> but my property doesn't overwrite
[11:23:28] <bskud> cause with jquery it works but not pure js
[11:23:37] <taplar> you need to put the first second class on the first one
[11:23:48] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/ty02v72q/1/
[11:24:04] <MassDebates> Ah, I see now
[11:24:15] <MassDebates> Sorry bskud my job here is to only debug working stuff.
[11:24:26] <MassDebates> taplar is the fixer-upper-guy
[11:24:42] <bskud> ok thx taplar
[11:24:55] <bskud> is not a good method ?
[11:24:58] <bskud> to toggle ?
[11:25:03] <bskud> it's clean no ?
[11:25:11] <taplar> seems to work.  i just didn't know it was also a js method
[11:25:17] <MassDebates> toggle is clean
[11:25:27] <bskud> ok thx
[11:25:47] <MassDebates> We haven't given taplar his daily dose of viper's blood yet
[11:25:48] <taplar> personally i'd remove $ from all your variables though, but that's me
[11:25:56] <MassDebates> so he's not all on his game yet
[11:26:16] <MassDebates> we typically save that sort of thing for really, really tough problems. or anything basic that I'm having trouble with.
[11:27:00] <bskud> oh I prefer $ style but ok
[11:27:19] <taplar> usually $ is used to identify a variable is a jQuery object.  of which none of yours are
[11:27:19] <MassDebates> that's like
[11:27:26] <MassDebates> an old convention for nilla js, no?
[11:27:31] <taplar> nah
[11:27:39] <taplar> usually it's the jQuery thing, or peeps coming from php
[11:27:45] <MassDebates> oh
[11:40:08] <CSWookie> Hey, folks.  Is this a good place to ask questions about jqwidgets, or is there another channel for that?
[11:41:14] <taplar> not sure what those are, but if it's jquery related here is fine
[12:24:26] <anexit> any good html5 players out there?
[12:27:17] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning #jquery
[12:27:26] <dglambert> yo
[12:27:52] <robertmaxrees> yoyo
[12:30:34] <AwkwardCough> break it down
[12:32:03] * taplar beat boxes
[12:32:05] <taplar> walk the dog~!
[12:35:53] <CSWookie> We use jqWidgets grids at my work, and I was wondering if there was a way to make them use native scrollbars, rather than the special ones.
[12:37:11] <robertmaxrees> might require some reworkng of styles and things.
[12:47:42] <MassDebates> god knows why you'd wantt o
[12:48:03] <robertmaxrees> because the native scroll bars are fine in 95% of cases.
[12:48:21] <robertmaxrees> and redesigning them can be not a great idea
[12:48:47] <MassDebates> I find that native scrollbars are ridiculously painful with some of the browsers that have quite a significant marketsahre
[12:48:49] <MassDebates> like edge.
[12:48:58] <MassDebates> Things are god awful for perfect centering
[12:48:58] <robertmaxrees> end users are used to them.
[12:49:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to much with their expectations.
[12:49:54] <robertmaxrees> *muck
[12:49:55] <MassDebates> I think that customizing scrollbars to make them more universally consistent is good so long as you respect native cues and boundaries.
[12:50:02] <robertmaxrees> i don't.
[12:50:04] <robertmaxrees> but okay :)
[12:50:31] <taplar> you guys have users?
[12:50:40] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:50:52] <MassDebates> That's probably because we disagree on how well edge fulfills standard expectation in UI
[12:51:26] <robertmaxrees> it has its own language that those users are used to (shrug)
[12:58:00] <tase> I'm trying to use $.when.apply($,[ajax1, ajax2, ajax3]).done(), but if one of the ajax calls returns 404, I lose all the other responses, aka arguments is just the 3-object part with the promise, "404" and "Not Found"
[12:58:14] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:58:19] <robertmaxrees> that's how $.when works.
[12:58:25] <robertmaxrees> if one fails, the whole thing fails.
[12:58:42] <tase> Is there a way to handle these 3 ajax calls one by one, without having a 404 spoil the bunch?
[12:58:51] <robertmaxrees> swap to .then()
[12:58:54] <robertmaxrees> or fix your api
[12:59:26] <tase> $.then.apply().done or $.when.apply().then()
[12:59:33] <robertmaxrees> neither.
[12:59:43] <robertmaxrees> thePromise.then()
[12:59:49] <robertmaxrees> you have to manage each separately.
[13:00:16] <tase> i see
[13:00:26] <robertmaxrees> that's how to spec works at least.
[13:00:31] <robertmaxrees> why not fix the API?
[13:00:40] <tase> im not in charge of the API
[13:00:44] <robertmaxrees> if a call results in a 404 and that's accept- oh.
[13:01:10] <tase> its 404 since the REST api says "its not found"
[13:01:13] <taplar> Another Persons Interface
[13:01:19] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:02:14] <taplar> if he kept the when() there are other options, no?  like always() ?
[13:03:04] <robertmaxrees> you could.
[13:03:14] <robertmaxrees> but .always() is a little funky./
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> "Note: The deferred.always() method receives the arguments that were used to .resolve() or .reject() the Deferred object, which are often very different. For this reason, it's best to use it only for actions that do not require inspecting the arguments"
[13:03:32] <tase> yea I read that part where it says to not count on the arguments in always()
[13:03:45] <tase> and always() also does promise/404/not-found
[13:03:48] <robertmaxrees> and .always() isn't apart of the promises api last i checked.
[13:03:58] <taplar> sure, just spitballing
[13:04:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah def.
[13:05:42] <taplar> oh i get what your saying.  depending on success or failure, the arguments would differ, so you'd have to check if it was good or bad to know which way to expet
[13:05:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:06:10] <taplar> but giving his use case, i'd think he'd need to check that anyway, if he went that route
[13:06:33] <robertmaxrees> imo .when() is the wrong tool.
[13:06:37] <robertmaxrees> because he doesn
[13:06:49] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't want to use it the way it's built.
[13:08:28] <tase> well i was just curious, i can make it work with a couple more ajax calls, or i can go bug the api guy
[13:08:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd bug the api guy and fix that contract.
[13:08:56] <robertmaxrees> because it sounds like you have a case where a "not found" is actually okay.
[13:11:12] <taplar> what is the call that is returning the 404 doing?
[13:11:34] <taplar> i'm assuming it's trying to retrieve a specific resource
[13:12:43] <tase> its trying to get the children of a node
[13:12:50] <tase> i get 404 since the node is a leaf
[13:13:19] <robertmaxrees> aaaah. so maybe you shouldn't make the call in the first place?
[13:13:26] <taplar> so... the leaf isn't found, or the children are not found?
[13:13:31] <tase> children
[13:13:48] <taplar> personally that seems more like a search to me then
[13:13:56] <taplar> which would be a 200 with no results
[13:14:00] <tase> yea im changing stuff around to "type check" the node, see if it's a leaf or not, before doing the "get children" call
[13:15:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[13:16:31] <taplar> it's always "fun" getting into conversations around rest practices
[13:16:47] <robertmaxrees> heh we're having a TON of conversations around that right now.
[13:16:56] <robertmaxrees> had nodesource out here join in on the fun.
[13:17:40] <taplar> anyone there of the midset that the response codes are only for server issues? :D
[13:17:49] <taplar> server/request
[13:17:52] <robertmaxrees> ish.
[13:18:18] <robertmaxrees> like... if the resource reall wasn't found, a 404 is appropriate.  but people conflate what "resource not found" means.
[13:18:28] <robertmaxrees> if I feed it a bad ID, for instance, 100% bad request.
[13:19:03] <taplar> i've seem peeps argue that's not a 404, that's a 200 with something on the response saying bad request
[13:19:08] <robertmaxrees> but let's say i have a valid productID and I ask for images for that product - that should really be an empty array.
[13:19:12] <taplar> which causes me to hit my head on a wall
[13:19:16] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:19:30] <robertmaxrees> people conflate the term "error" aaaaall the time.
[14:00:42] <joe___> Is this the right place to seek help with jquery?
[14:00:49] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[14:01:11] <joe___> Can I just post a block of code here or is there a format that I should follow?
[14:01:19] <robertmaxrees> use a paste service.
[14:01:27] <robertmaxrees> the channel topic lists some.
[14:01:44] <robertmaxrees> a working test case on jsfiddle is usually preferred.
[14:02:42] <joe___> http://codepen.io/vibrains/pen/ENOOrN
[14:03:21] <robertmaxrees> btw you can't technically create your own attributes :)
[14:03:24] <robertmaxrees> but anyway.
[14:03:28] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[14:03:28] <joe___> I want to be able to click off of the popup and have the popup disappear
[14:03:38] <joe___> I’m new to jQuery
[14:04:30] <robertmaxrees> so instead of  image-popup-open you should really use a class.
[14:04:53] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[14:05:15] <robertmaxrees> you can bind an event listener to document and check if event.target or a parent is inside the modal.  if not, close it.
[14:05:30] <robertmaxrees> OR you can attach a handler to the overlay.
[14:05:32] <robertmaxrees> either/or.
[14:06:04] <joe___> Yea basically I want to be able to click anwhere on the overlay and have the popup fade out
[14:06:09] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:06:15] <robertmaxrees> just explained tow ways to make that happen :)
[14:06:42] <joe___> thanks
[14:06:56] <robertmaxrees> also: get rid of those custom attributes.
[14:07:11] <joe___> Ok
[14:07:54] <joe___> Can I just change those attributes to classes?>
[14:08:01] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[14:08:08] <robertmaxrees> classes are good for selecting.
[14:08:14] <robertmaxrees> you also want to store data on those elements.
[14:08:37] <joe___> Ok
[14:09:03] <robertmaxrees> that's what the data attributes are for.
[14:09:15] <robertmaxrees> and the image-popup one is basically an ID.
[14:09:19] <robertmaxrees> on those modals themselves.
[14:09:30] <joe___> right
[14:12:20] <psy123> Hello guys I am a total newbie in js, what do we name &sometext in a url? parameter?
[14:12:39] <robertmaxrees> query string parameter
[14:14:28] <psy123> is there a way to have a function with an optional query string parameter, in some conditions the query parameter should be there else don't include that in the url?
[14:14:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:15:39] <robertmaxrees> "a function with an optional query string parameter" sounds... strange.  could you maybe show what you're trying to do in a jsfiddle?
[14:16:57] <psy123> Yes sorry robertmaxrees
[14:17:06] <psy123> I have this https://jsfiddle.net/oc9uemwc/
[14:17:26] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what are you trying to do?
[14:19:20] <psy123> I have another parameter i want to include in this url but only if it's rendered
[14:19:32] <robertmaxrees> "only if it's rendered"?
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> define "rendered"
[14:19:59] <psy123> well the variables in {{}} are coming from a view
[14:20:27] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so there's some variable you may have?
[14:20:47] <psy123> Yes, do i need to rewrite the function
[14:20:55] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:21:05] <robertmaxrees> i mean, I wouldn't approached this differently.
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> *would've
[14:21:39] <psy123> Yes?
[14:22:32] <robertmaxrees> sure.  a few different ways.  one would be an array of names and values, then just doing a quick map and join to get what you want.
[14:23:30] <psy123> using an if else?
[14:23:34] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:23:41] <robertmaxrees> then you don't need to use any conditionals.
[14:23:49] <robertmaxrees> you just make sure you have the object available.
[14:27:57] <psy123> I think i am confused about the flow here, let me explain maybe you can help me out
[14:28:03] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:28:07] <robertmaxrees> iu'm showing you the idea.
[14:28:26] <psy123> thanks
[14:28:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/oc9uemwc/1/
[14:28:49] <robertmaxrees> instead of conditionally appending things, keep it simple.
[14:32:11] <psy123> Yes this is simple,
[14:33:05] <psy123> but i don't know how many parameters i'll have, do i need to handle that on the view side?
[14:33:14] <psy123> bear with me ..
[14:33:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:33:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:33:24] <robertmaxrees> it's all controlled via the array
[14:35:06] <tase> spoke to the API guy, said i was going to do a pre-check, and he told me I had to handle 404/etc codes because business logic
[14:35:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:35:28] <robertmaxrees> srs
[14:35:28] <tase> i get the feeling business logic shoudln't return 404
[14:35:43] <robertmaxrees> he's conflating "business logic" with "API"
[14:35:54] <tase> i think his logic for the REST 404 is => item not found in the DB = 404
[14:36:01] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:36:04] <tase> not children = 404
[14:36:06] <tase> no*
[14:36:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, he's conflating.
[14:38:54] <psy123> But in case one value is None?
[14:39:28] <psy123> robertmaxrees of the array
[14:39:39] <taplar> i would disagree that no children is 404.  children is plural, it's not a specific resource
[14:40:30] <tase> it's not exactly that binding, but im essentially doing parent.children.target
[14:40:45] <tase> well, parent.children[0..n].target, and target returns 404
[14:41:21] <robertmaxrees> psy123 "one value is none"?
[14:41:23] <taplar> none of that is an ajax call...
[14:41:28] <robertmaxrees> then you shouldn't include it in the array.
[14:42:23] <psy123> okay thanks
[14:57:22] <tase> taplar, well its abstracted; api/model/process/#parentId -> {children: api/model/process/#parentId/exchanges -> [api/model/exchange/#exchangeId1, api/model/exchange/#exchangeId2, etc..]}
[14:57:45] <tase> then api/model/exchange/#exchangeId1 -> {target : api/model/process/#childId }
[14:58:18] <robertmaxrees> tase it's not very well abstracted if the business logic has that kind of sway over the API response :)
[14:58:45] <tase> lol i meant my parent.children[].target thing
[14:59:10] <taplar> so.. the responses are telling you the endpoints to hit?
[14:59:36] <tase> yea essentially
[14:59:48] <taplar> and then hitting that target endpoint is returning the 404?
[14:59:51] <tase> instead of having target: childId, it's directly the URL
[14:59:52] <tase> yea
[14:59:59] <taplar> ok, that's cool.  404 makes sense there
[15:00:06] <tase> i.e for a leaf, the target is non-existent
[15:00:17] <taplar> then why does the endpoint return that url?
[15:00:22] <tase> :>
[15:00:55] <taplar> i'm assuming #childId is an actual id for a child, right?
[15:01:06] <tase> yea, like /api/model/process/100893
[15:01:12] <tase> would return, 404 Not Found, {}
[15:01:19] <taplar> and you are saying the endpoint is returning one of those, but it does not exist?
[15:01:36] <tase> ye
[15:01:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:01:49] <taplar> yeah, unless the element was deleted since that was got, then that's fked up
[15:02:06] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:02:07] <taplar> how can the api give you an id for something that doesn't exist?
[15:02:08] <robertmaxrees> bad contract
[15:02:45] <tase> i think its generated from the parent
[15:02:58] <taplar> how?
[15:03:09] <tase> ie parent process Id 10 -> exchange Id 38 -> "target" process Id 38
[15:05:13] <taplar> i dunno, kinda hard to visualize what's happening, but it seems really strange
[15:05:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:05:29] <robertmaxrees> the api shouldn't return things that break.
[15:08:15] <tase> i told the api guy that if he wanted to send me business logic "errors", that he should use non-error codes and just give me meaningful content
[15:24:01] <Sayona> Hi
[15:24:58] <tase> Hi
[15:26:30] <MassDebates> Hi
[15:30:42] <Sayona> I use datepicker , can anyone help me to get the date and insert in input value?
[15:31:14] <robertmaxrees> the docs should make that pretty easy.
[15:32:15] <Sayona> no find...
[15:33:15] <robertmaxrees> so let's start
[15:33:28] <robertmaxrees> you want to get the current date from the datepicker, yeah?
[15:33:47] <Sayona> yes
[15:35:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[15:35:27] <robertmaxrees> looks like the examples make it pretty clear.
[15:35:47] <Sayona> yes that i found
[15:35:56] <robertmaxrees> so what part are you stuck on?
[15:36:02] <Sayona> but how I pase the data in a value="" to put in post?
[15:37:44] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-getDate
[15:39:14] <robertmaxrees> sooo what's the issue?
[15:39:25] <robertmaxrees> how to set the value of an input?
[15:41:36] <Sayona>                         var currentDate = $( "#stage1_data" ).datepicker( "getDate" );
[15:41:36] <Sayona>                         $('#stage1_data').val(currentDate);
[15:41:47] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:41:56] <robertmaxrees>  $('#stage1_data') is the date input.
[15:42:03] <Sayona> yes
[15:42:05] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it's fiddle time.
[15:42:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:42:11] <Sayona> yes
[15:45:39] <Sayona> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/cr6s4n2z/
[15:46:47] <joe___> Hey Robert, here is what I got so far, again, I’m a noob
[15:46:48] <joe___> http://codepen.io/vibrains/pen/ENOOrN
[15:47:22] <robertmaxrees> Sayona huh?  are you using jqueryui's datepicker or bootstrap's?
[15:47:31] <robertmaxrees> joe___ are yoiu asking for feedback?
[15:47:33] <Sayona> datepicker
[15:47:43] <robertmaxrees> Sayona right...
[15:47:44] <robertmaxrees> whcih?
[15:47:47] <joe___> Yes please…
[15:47:51] <Sayona> <script type="text/javascript" src="/vendor/jquery/bootstrap-datepicker.js"></script>
[15:48:07] <robertmaxrees> Sayona then look at the bootstrap docs, yo.
[15:48:11] <robertmaxrees> not the jquery ui ones.
[15:48:13] <joe___> If you dont mind
[15:48:21] <Sayona> :(
[15:48:55] <sillyslux> joe___, closing the modal by clicking on the black gives me a white flash
[15:48:59] <robertmaxrees> joe___ you're repeating a lot of work here.
[15:49:28] <joe___> I figured I was repeating
[15:49:38] <robertmaxrees> btn-one et al - make a class for these instead.
[15:49:42] <robertmaxrees> that they share.
[15:50:20] <robertmaxrees> then put a data attribute on 'em that's like data-popup-class="popup-inner-five" or something.
[15:50:52] <Sayona> $('#stage1_data').val()
[15:50:55] <joe___> Oh I see
[15:51:01] <robertmaxrees> and then also give your popups a shared class and select on that instead of selecting all of them for that fadeout
[15:51:01] <Sayona> and I need to put this in value=""
[15:51:15] <robertmaxrees> Sayona then do that.
[15:51:19] <robertmaxrees> otherwise make a functioning fiddle :)
[15:54:37] <joe___> How would I append the data attribute here: $(".popup-inner-one, #overlay").fadeIn(300);
[15:54:48] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:56:02] <duch_kazatel> comcaaaaast
[15:56:20] <michelem> hello folks!
[15:57:56] <duch_kazatel> hullo
[15:58:39] <Sayona> :(
[15:59:03] <michelem> I'm using the colorbox plugin, and I load the colorbox content as a link (new request). I noticed that with this setup the free <script> code within the loaded HTML does not get executed
[15:59:36] <duch_kazatel> via ajax?
[16:01:04] <duch_kazatel> michelem are you loading that content via ajax?
[16:01:28] <michelem> duch_kazatel: hold on, I'm checking :)
[16:05:06] <michelem> it doesn't seem so, there's only a link whose class is then .colorbox()ed
[16:05:21] <michelem> however, I now notice if I link the js from the HTML it gets executed
[16:08:52] <duch_kazatel> wait what?
[16:09:08] <duch_kazatel> how do the js and html get included on the apge?
[16:09:09] <duch_kazatel> *page
[16:22:41] <michelem> they get loaded by colorbox()'s black magic
[16:23:02] <michelem> colorbox follows the link, retrieves the HTML and loads it into the modal
[16:39:03] <pippuccio76> HI at all ,sorry for english , im tryng to write a code to change dinamically select with ajax
[16:40:29] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 clarify?
[16:41:03] <pippuccio76> the workflow is change the select n.1 selectn.2 are populated ,change select number 2 and populated 3 select and write 3 string
[16:41:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:41:17] <robertmaxrees> where are you stuck?
[16:41:30] <pippuccio76> but if i change select n. 1 the other not change
[16:41:50] <robertmaxrees> have an example in a jsfiddle to share?
[16:41:53] <pippuccio76> the event for all is change
[16:43:39] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/uu63fLhy/
[16:44:30] <robertmaxrees> errr/
[16:44:41] <robertmaxrees> have the rendered stuff instead?
[16:44:54] <pippuccio76> ther'is some php n the code
[16:45:03] <robertmaxrees> right, but js doesn't know anythinmg about that.
[16:45:10] <robertmaxrees> it just looks at the rendered html.
[16:45:53] <pippuccio76> the first select is pupulated by a db table
[16:46:00] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't matter
[16:46:04] <robertmaxrees> just copy the rendered html and js.
[16:46:06] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[16:46:16] <robertmaxrees> the js doesn't know anything about the php.
[16:51:58] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/a5ykpqut/
[16:53:15] <robertmaxrees> so what's the part that doesn't work here?
[16:54:02] <robertmaxrees> also why do you habve like 5 handlers on the same element?
[16:56:01] <pippuccio76> if i change select sel_tipo_materiali2 i populated select sel_materiale2 ,when i change sel_materiale2 i populated other field but when other field are populated if i change  sel_tipo_materiali2 the other dont return to start
[16:56:18] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:56:27] <robertmaxrees> you have to set the .html() of those before your ajax calls.
[16:57:56] <pippuccio76>    success: function(msg)
[16:57:56] <pippuccio76>            {
[16:57:56] <pippuccio76>            $("#codice2").html(msg);//stampa i risultati dentro la seconda select
[16:57:56] <pippuccio76>            },
[16:58:03] <robertmaxrees> yo
[16:58:09] <robertmaxrees> no multiline pastes.
[16:58:13] <pippuccio76> ok
[16:58:13] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?
[16:58:49] <pippuccio76> why when i change the first the other dont return at start point?
[16:59:00] <robertmaxrees> you don't set them to do it.
[16:59:55] <pippuccio76> see code on     $('#sel_materiale2').change(function() change the other field
[17:00:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:00:17] <pippuccio76> if  $('#sel_tipo_materiali2').change(function()
[17:00:24] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:00:31] <robertmaxrees> you change that, it changes $("#sel_materiale2")
[17:00:31] <pippuccio76> i change #sel_materiale2
[17:00:35] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:00:55] <robertmaxrees> do you also want to change sel_numero_dente2 when you do that?
[17:01:29] <pippuccio76> yes i want to return on select numero_dente....
[17:02:02] <robertmaxrees> right - so you have to explicitly select it and do that.
[17:02:37] <pippuccio76> sorry but change event do this, it's true?
[17:02:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:02:51] <robertmaxrees> change event is only when you select something yourself.
[17:02:57] <robertmaxrees> not when you change the html.
[17:03:02] <pippuccio76> when i change i have an ajax call
[17:03:12] <robertmaxrees> duder.
[17:03:21] <robertmaxrees> you're not targeting that third dropdown.
[17:03:25] <robertmaxrees> so nothing changes.
[17:03:26] <pippuccio76> select is the event when i select
[17:03:38] <pippuccio76> change is when the field change
[17:03:44] <robertmaxrees> dude
[17:03:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:03:52] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening.
[17:22:11] <Zzaichik1> turn up the belltones homie
[17:22:24] <Zzaichik1> homeskillet
[17:31:22] <taplar> homeskillet and toasterboy, cooking up lots of fun.  this summer, on nickelodian
[17:34:09] <Zzaichik1> haha
[17:43:40] <jffees> hey, is there a difference between () => {} and () => ()
[17:44:03] <taplar> {} makes a block
[17:44:08] <taplar> so you can do multiple things
[17:44:19] <taplar> () is just parenthesies
[17:45:15] <jffees> so is it preferable to use () if i just have one statement?
[17:45:24] <taplar> or do without
[17:46:40] <jffees> alrighty, thanks
[17:51:18] <Zzaichik1> what is the preferred usage
[17:51:43] <taplar> i dunno that there is one.  really up to personal preference if you ask me
[17:51:49] <Zzaichik1> yeah
[17:51:54] <robertmaxrees> the parents make a statement.
[17:52:02] <Zzaichik1> I like using them always. Curlys
[17:52:08] <robertmaxrees> so you don't technically need them save for some special cases.
[17:52:38] <shoky> yea, stupid parents
[17:52:46] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:52:46] <robertmaxrees> woops
[17:52:53] <shoky> :p
[17:52:55] <Zzaichik1> lol
[17:52:59] <taplar> yeah that threw me off
[17:53:11] <taplar> i thought he was cracking some joke i missed
[17:53:19] <Zzaichik1> I thought I missed something too.
[17:53:25] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:53:27] <Zzaichik1> Just play along like I totally know what he's referring to
[17:53:33] <Zzaichik1> yep…. parents
[17:53:33] <taplar> the parents create the baby arrow statement in their own reflection
[17:53:42] <taplar> reflection/image
[17:53:49] <shoky> i didn't miss anything, obviously dude has some parents issues
[17:54:00] <Zzaichik1> hahha
[17:54:05] <robertmaxrees> well i mean
[17:54:27] <taplar> rob doesn't like () so, obviously, two few hugs
[17:54:42] <Zzaichik1> lol
[17:54:52] <Zzaichik1> two or too
[17:55:03] <taplar> either
[17:55:04] <jffees> quick reminder, what does it mean if there is a variable wrapped in {} in fat arrow, like ({var}) => {}
[17:55:04] <shoky> }{  nose-kissing parents
[17:55:11] <taplar> lol
[17:55:17] <taplar> uh
[17:55:22] <taplar> syntax error?
[17:55:27] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with fat arrows.
[17:55:31] <shoky> jffees that's deconstruction?
[17:55:43] <shoky> argument deconstruction, or whatever it's called
[17:55:54] <robertmaxrees> destruction
[17:55:55] <snover> destructuring
[17:56:00] <robertmaxrees> err, that
[17:56:03] <shoky> er ya
[17:56:03] <Zzaichik1> fat arrow, that was uncalled for
[17:56:19] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Pulling_fields_from_objects_passed_as_function_parameter
[17:57:01] <taplar> yes!  i was right, right?  {var} is synatx error
[17:57:16] <shoky> yo momma so fat, you got 3 parents uhh fat arrow joke uhhh  ok that didn't work
[17:57:18] <snover> only because var is a keyword.
[17:57:25] <robertmaxrees> taplar nope.
[17:57:30] <robertmaxrees> err, heh
[17:57:37] <taplar> i meas thinking more like { chad } where chad is like chat = "wee"
[17:57:44] <taplar> err, you get it
[17:57:48] <shoky> lol @ chad
[17:58:06] <taplar> thought you had to have key value for stuff like that, and this page looks to do that too
[17:58:10] <shoky> i can't tell what's a joke anymore
[17:58:16] <robertmaxrees> destructuring taplar
[17:58:33] <taplar> shoky: serious about not understanding the destructuring
[18:00:31] <taplar> oh i think i see
[18:01:01] <Zzaichik1> your momma soo fat, :before touches :after   bam. Okay, still lame.
[18:01:13] <jffees> so if I do ({test}) => {} and and I pass in (one) the value passed will be one.test?
[18:01:14] <taplar> so {chad} = {chad:4};  chad === 4 ?
[18:02:03] <shoky> taplar: yep
[18:02:12] <taplar> interesting
[18:02:21] <shoky> jffees: no
[18:02:33] <shoky> jffees: you have to pass in an object
[18:03:01] <taplar> i'm so not up on all the es6 stuff yet
[18:03:03] <shoky> if that object has a "test" property, then inside the function you'll have a "test" argument equal to whatever the test property was
[18:04:34] <taplar> just the other day someone told me about Array.from() and blew my freakin mind
[18:05:02] <shoky> heh
[18:05:15] <taplar> no IE support yet, but still.  I'm watching it now, :)
[18:05:23] <robertmaxrees> babel.
[18:05:35] <taplar> babel will convert stuff like that down too?
[18:06:03] <robertmaxrees> https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/ -> "This means you can use new built-ins like Promise or WeakMap, static methods like Array.from or Object.assign [...]"
[18:06:29] <taplar> ahhh, ok, so i'd have to install that guy and change my gulp.  hmm.
[18:06:50] <robertmaxrees> it's worth it tbh.
[18:06:59] <robertmaxrees> also: https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/
[18:07:07] <robertmaxrees> shows you what babel supports, too.
[18:11:23] <taplar> mmm, i may hold off on that.  their pollyfil for from is pretty large
[18:13:02] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) minify and gzip.
[18:13:05] <robertmaxrees> one-time hit.
[18:13:46] <taplar> it's probably cause they are doing a complete pollyfil, where as my use is only ever passing the object to it
[19:50:13] <blackwater> Hey guys, I'm having trouble delegating a submit event on a form : http://laravel.io/bin/eDaNb
[19:50:31] <blackwater> active-app.js: http://laravel.io/bin/Mk9dQ
[19:51:42] <blackwater> it seems like the event callback never gets fired, any thoughts?
[20:05:06] <duch_kazatel> blackwater did you ever figure it out?
[20:05:39] <blackwater> I did but I have no idea how, first, I neglected to put the call inside $(function(){})
[20:05:45] <duch_kazatel> ah
[20:05:46] <blackwater> so I did that, still no luck
[20:06:09] <blackwater> then I changed data-api-uri="..." to action="...
[20:06:17] <blackwater> and just had jquery get the uri from that
[20:06:19] <blackwater> works now
[20:11:45] <ihuman1> Hello
[20:13:09] <ihuman1> Anyone here?
