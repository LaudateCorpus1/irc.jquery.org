[00:38:40] <Mark_2> anybody know how to use greensock tweenmax?
[01:16:50] <Xatenev> Morning
[01:18:22] <slax0r> morning
[01:29:43] <Uhkis> day
[01:51:48] <baako> what string against define? http://jsfiddle.net/ehppvvjn/
[01:52:04] <baako> hi guys i am DOING POST to another url using phonegap http://kopy.io/AieN0 BUT i keep encountering an error shown in chrome console log POST failed
[01:55:14] <Cork> baako: most likely cause of cors
[01:55:21] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[01:55:22] <b-ot> Cork: HTTP access control (CORS) - HTTP | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[02:03:28] <layke> Hey. I'm looking for a jquery plugin (I know it exists.. I stupidly didn't bookmark last month)...
[02:03:48] <layke> It is an image plugin that lets you define locations on the image, that you can click on, and it will open another image
[02:04:45] <layke> I have a client that wants to have a drone cam of his property, and then have pictures avaialble to click on the image and pop up. The plugin was pretty nice..
[02:05:51] <Cork> layke: you could do that with just a simple map element
[02:06:05] <layke> Yep. I'm about to start unless I can find it in the next 5 minutes
[02:07:22] <Cork> layke: http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/ ?
[02:07:47] <layke> It wasn't that one, but I'll see if that one is suitable.
[02:07:47] <Cork> never really needed a plugin like that so donno
[02:08:12] <layke> Yeah don't worry. I'm able to code this myself, but I'm just being somewhat lazy on using image maps to do it.
[02:08:22] <layke> The plugin added markers, rather than "maps"
[02:08:30] <baako> what is the link you use to get latest jquery?
[02:08:35] <layke> Like that plugin, and allowed you to specify locations of them plus another image and then captions
[02:08:41] <layke> It was pretty nicely done..
[02:08:41] <baako> dont wanna download
[02:08:52] <Uhkis> baako: google cdn is nice
[02:09:01] <Cork> baako: code.jquery.com
[02:09:25] <baako> not that Cork
[02:09:44] <Cork> baako: what's wrong with that site?
[02:09:54] <layke> I think he wants the CDN link
[02:09:57] <Cork> it is a cdn
[02:09:59] <layke> Which is available on there.
[02:10:01] <layke> anyway
[02:10:25] <Cork> it didn't use to be, but that was a long time ago
[03:08:37] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to show a menu on scroll down and depending of the position with this script: http://jsfiddle.net/1t0faf3m/ But i get an error TypeError: $(...).offset(...) is undefined
[03:08:46] <abailarri> There is not support of offset=
[03:08:47] <abailarri> ?
[03:09:26] <Cork> abailarri: check the api documentation
[03:09:51] <Cork> but yes, offset is a function
[03:37:59] <delboy1978uk> how do i check that an element exists ?
[03:38:49] <sacho> $('selector').length
[03:40:37] <delboy1978uk> sacho: thanks
[03:41:07] <Mark_2> one question : how do i first removeclass and then add class?  would this work? jQuery('.open_contents').click(function() {
[03:41:08] <Mark_2> 	jQuery('.board_contents', top.document).removeClass('slideIn'); jQuery('.board_contents', top.document).addClass('slideIn');})
[03:42:24] <sacho> you don't have to select twice
[03:42:30] <sacho> .removeClass().addClass()
[03:42:41] <sacho> not sure what you want to accomplish with that, though
[03:43:45] <Mark_2> basically, im trying to create site like this http://vlanda.com/
[03:44:18] <Mark_2> how can i add some delays on removing the class and then add class?
[03:45:52] <delboy1978uk> Mark_2: setTimeout()
[03:46:16] <delboy1978uk> or .delay()
[03:46:24] <delboy1978uk> probs .delay()
[03:46:48] <Mark_2> is this right? 	jQuery('.board_contents', top.document).removeClass('slideIn').delay(2).addClass('slideIn');
[03:47:17] <Mark_2> ihmm,
[03:47:36] <Mark_2> for some reason the class doesn’t get removed before being added.
[03:49:56] <sacho> delay(2) is 2 milliseconds.
[03:50:51] <Mark_2> yeah it doesn’t remove the class.
[03:53:30] <sacho> you need to execute the addClass after the delay
[03:54:37] <sacho> $().remove().delay().promise().then(function () { this.addclass() })
[03:56:30] <morfin> ow
[03:57:46] <morfin> i used BlueBird with jQuery )
[04:22:59] <frox> hi, i have serios trouble while using jquery and fotorama in an ebay-template. here is an example page: http://ebay.icartech.de/icartech-s730-fur-volkswagen-seat-und-skoda.html this template is used in ebay here: http://www.ebay.de/itm/VW-Passat-Sharan-nach-Facelift-7-Android-Autoradio-GPS-DVD-Bluetooth-Skoda-Seat-/181622660029? mostly, the gallery on top is not loaded correctly. i realy dont
[04:22:59] <frox> know why. please, can you guys give me a hint, how to fix this?
[04:23:42] <frox> if you reload the page, it will be shopn correct
[04:24:58] <frox> there is also no JS error in the browser console
[04:25:12] <Cork> if it shows correctly if you reload it sounds like a race
[04:25:20] <Cork> so if you load from cache it works
[04:25:26] <frox> ok
[04:25:45] <frox> so what do you think is the part i have to wait for?
[04:26:00] <guest90039> Hi, I know I had this issue before but never actually remembered the solution. When I post data with ajax to php. I get php response followed by the entire html code. What are the causes of this?
[04:26:15] <Cork> frox: too much minified js and too much to dig through to answer
[04:26:29] <Cork> frox: check everything that does async ajax/setTimeout
[04:26:35] <Cork> it is prob where the problem comes from
[04:27:08] <frox> Cork: do you think i can happen because auf very large pictures?
[04:27:12] <Cork> guest90039: most likely cause php includes another file
[04:27:19] <frox> auf=>of
[04:27:51] <frox> they are 2000x2000
[04:28:03] <Cork> frox: i even have a problem saying what it is you have problem with
[04:28:16] <Cork> it is just too much js and external resources in that page
[04:28:59] <Cork> so you're best option is to try to reduce things to find where things go belly up
[04:30:11] <frox> ok, is see. eventualy you want to take a look at this: http://ebay.icartech.de/js/ict-ebay/ict-ebay.js in the lines 8 to 16 you wil find my code for loading that gallery
[04:32:04] <frox> i wait one second for the initializing of the gallery an then another second for initializing the thum-controll
[04:32:07] <frox> +b
[04:37:42] <guest90039> I found the issue Cork: it started occuring when I redirected index.php to /start/ in the nginx config file.
[04:37:53] <guest90039> Had to change function.php?post=foo to /function?post=foo
[04:41:22] <amore123> Im getting this warning: Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/
[04:41:55] <amore123> I just have added to my ajax request type, url and success.
[04:42:16] <amore123> Im not mentioning anything about sync
[04:46:37] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I'm using ajaxStart to show a loading screen.  It works for ajax calls that I make myself, but there is one $.ajax inside of a plugin I'm using that doesn't fire it - any ideas?
[04:47:32] <amore123> I have added "async: true" but the warning is still there..
[04:48:03] <Cork> MarcGuay: most plugin might not be using jquery $.ajax
[04:48:23] <MarcGuay> Cork: But it is
[04:48:34] <Cork> amore123: $.ajax is async by default
[04:49:01] <Cork> MarcGuay: have you looked at the code that makes the call?
[04:49:05] <MarcGuay> Cork: Yes
[04:49:06] <amore123> so Should I care about the warning?
[04:49:08] <Cork> could you paste bin it?
[04:49:13] <Cork> amore123: yes
[04:49:19] <Cork> sync ajax is a BAD idea
[04:49:27] <MarcGuay> Cork: https://github.com/scdoshi/jquery-ajaxchimp/blob/master/jquery.ajaxchimp.js
[04:49:38] <MarcGuay> line 120
[04:49:45] <sacho> amore123, try making a test case to show this off.
[04:50:00] <Cork> MarcGuay: jsonp
[04:50:07] <Cork> that uses <script> not xhr
[04:50:11] <Cork> so ya, not really an option
[04:50:12] <MarcGuay> Cork: I was wondering about that.
[04:50:15] <amore123> but Im not syncing it.. this is my code: https://gist.github.com/Ziiweb/6bc24618fd6d56dfbc65
[04:50:32] <Cork> MarcGuay: you could move to jquery 2.x it most likely supports it
[04:50:32] <MarcGuay> Cork: Thanks
[04:50:37] <sacho> amore123, that's not really a test case
[04:50:39] <Cork> but that removes support for ie < 9
[04:50:41] <amore123> sacho, what do you mean exactly?
[04:51:01] <amore123> what is a test case?  :S
[04:51:05] <Cork> amore123: he means reduce the code to a small snippet you can show
[04:51:12] <sacho> amore123, http://jsfiddle.net/k9hpb6fL/ -> no warning
[04:51:13] <Cork> a demo of the problem
[04:51:27] <Uhkis> why is sync ajax such a bad idea?
[04:51:45] <Cork> Uhkis: to start with, cause it freezes the page until the network request ends
[04:52:03] <sacho> Uhkis, because it's pointless
[04:52:14] <Cork> so if you get a network drop you have an unresponsive page for several minutes
[04:52:20] <sacho> you gain nothing from using sync ajax, compared to all the negatives
[04:52:24] <Cork> sacho: pointless is too hard
[04:52:33] <Cork> it has its uses, but it has big drawbacks
[04:52:54] <sacho> it doesn't really have any uses
[04:52:57] <Uhkis> Cork: well that's a valid reason
[04:53:07] <Uhkis> sacho: i just used it a week ago or so
[04:53:12] <Cork> sacho: try to make an ajax call that has to finish before the page unloads
[04:53:18] <Cork> for example
[04:53:25] <Cork> but ya, that is about the only case i know of
[04:53:28] <sacho> that's awful, no thanks
[04:53:50] <Cork> i have page automations that break from time to time for this exact reason
[04:54:57] <Cork> Uhkis: but basically sync ajax can do var a = <request>;
[04:55:03] <Cork> while async has to use callbacks
[04:55:23] <titii> Can I access to the event to make preventDefault by the whole element object? How? For example i have el $('.some-el')
[04:55:27] <Cork> so if you can restructure the code you can almost always do the same thing without the locking
[04:55:42] <Cork> sacho: also sync -  anything in js causes bugs
[04:56:01] <Cork> sacho: something as simple as alert('was here') is scary for this exact reason
[04:56:26] <sacho> you don't need to sell me on not using sync ajax, considering I called it pointless
[04:56:49] <Cork> if it is called in an event handler, the browser has to store the state of the js engine
[04:56:59] <Cork> about the execution, and then do the dialog
[04:57:04] <sacho> funny story, I had a sync problem just a while ago.
[04:57:19] <Cork> when the dialog is done, try to spin the event to fake that is was never stopped
[04:57:28] <Cork> this cause double events and lost of other nasty things
[04:57:32] <sacho> on old firefox versions, firing a custom event is synchronous.
[04:58:43] <sacho> which was breaking a caching mechanism, yay.
[04:58:53] <Cork> fun
[04:59:02] <sacho> titii, I couldn't make sense of what you said.
[04:59:27] <titii> another question, can i make a selector for el and some selection like $(el, '.some-el')  where el is an object? like $('.one, .two')?
[04:59:56] <Cork> titii: if you mean merge two selections
[04:59:58] <Cork> use .add
[04:59:58] <sacho> check out add()
[05:00:07] <titii> thanx
[05:00:09] <Cork> ?api add
[05:00:09] <b-ot> Cork: .add(): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[05:00:22] <titii> ty
[05:08:33] <prohobo> hey
[05:08:52] <prohobo> are there any resources/articles on keeping your js/jquery code DOM-safe?
[05:09:07] <prohobo> i currently have code that breaks on slow computers
[05:09:33] <prohobo> because i didnt debug slow DOM object loading
[05:09:48] <prohobo> you know, trying to select objects that don't exist yet..
[05:10:44] <Cork> prohobo: the most important thing to do to avoid slow code is to never append in loops
[05:10:59] <Cork> always build sets and add them in one go
[05:15:10] <prohobo> thanks Cork i'll refactor some stuff
[05:15:36] <prohobo> but it can still mess up... do i just have to accept that or is there some way I can force waiting?
[05:15:49] <Cork> force waiting?
[05:16:15] <Cork> you can profile the code and see where the bulk of the time is spent
[05:16:26] <Cork> if that is what you meant
[05:16:35] <prohobo> i mean like $(window).load()
[05:16:44] <prohobo> except.. everywhere
[05:16:48] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[05:17:39] <prohobo> nvm
[05:17:54] <prohobo> just hoping for magic
[05:17:57] <prohobo> :P
[05:21:45] <amore123> sacho, Cork, this is all code related to my request: https://gist.github.com/Ziiweb/af34812b21c03078b3b7 Also "carrito_frontend.js" is totally empty. The warning is shown because the line "<script type="text/javascript" src="/bundles/projectfrontend/js/carrito_frontend.js"></script>"
[05:22:33] <Cork> amore123: so check what carrito_frontend.js does
[05:22:49] <Cork> it might do something like $.ajaxSetup({ async: false })
[05:23:21] <amore123> Cork, nothing, carrijo_frontend.js is empty
[05:23:27] <Cork> O_o
[05:24:12] <Cork> are you sure?
[05:24:31] <Cork> so you don't hit a cache or something (tried clearing the browser cache?)
[05:26:07] <amore123> sorry, I dont understand, sometimes your english is bit difficult for me..
[05:26:22] <Cork> amore123: try clearing the browsers cache
[05:26:38] <Cork> so it isn't that you're running with old scripts somewhere
[05:27:25] <amore123> yes, I have just cleared and the warning is still there
[05:29:20] <amore123> wait, even if I remove the line the warning is still there..
[05:30:02] <Cork> ya, it doesn't look likely to come from that
[05:33:26] <amore123> well, now there is no warning if I remove the line.. Even if carrito_frontend.js is empty
[05:37:44] <amore123> Cork, here you have the document http://gazien.com/productos/moviles
[05:41:32] <Cork> amore123: from where do you get the warning?
[05:41:56] <Cork> ah, there
[05:42:00] <workerbeetwo> var title_text = $('title').text(); if (title_text.contains("crap"))    <-- chrome complains about undefined not being a function. in firefox it works just fine.
[05:42:15] <amore123> but im on firefox
[05:42:26] <Cork> amore123: could you replace https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js with https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.js ?
[05:42:52] <sacho> workerbeetwo, there's no .contains() function for strings
[05:43:04] <Cork> sacho: there is, but it is extreamly new
[05:43:39] <Cork> and i think they renamed it to includes now days
[05:43:40] <amore123> Cork, after the change for the jquery include the error is the same
[05:43:51] <Cork> amore123: expected, but debugging is easier
[05:44:13] <Cork> amore123: could you do it in the testcase?
[05:44:22] <Cork> that was kinda what i asked for
[05:45:30] <amore123> ‎here you have the test case after the change: http://gazien.com/productos/moviles
[05:45:53] <Cork> amore123: it looks like firefox sniffs is the third argument to xhr.open is set or not
[05:46:04] <Cork> and complains if it is, even if it is true
[05:46:14] <Cork> so ya, you can ignore that error
[05:46:33] <Cork> hmm should prob file a bug about that...
[05:48:12] <zhulikas__> guys, you know when you have two divs with float:left and if there isn't enough horizontal space - second div drops below, righht?
[05:48:14] <zhulikas__> how can i make it stay on the right and ignore width problems? overflow:hidden wouldn't work, not sure what it should be
[05:48:46] <amore123> so I should expect the warning if I add async: false in Chrome, but I cat not see if I add "async: false", why?
[05:49:38] <Cork> amore123: i don't now if chrome warns about sync calls
[05:49:49] <Cork> and if you never set async: anything
[05:49:51] <dismist> zhulikas: float:right; width:100%
[05:49:54] <Cork> you are safe
[05:50:13] <zhulikas__> dismist: then it drops there immediately
[05:50:15] <zhulikas__> :(
[05:50:43] <amore123> Cork, do you remember any browser that warns about it apart from firefox?
[05:50:58] <dismist> for the original declaration do something like width:contentarea[px]; max-width:100%;
[05:51:03] <Cork> amore123: you shouldn't depend on browser warnings for things like this
[05:51:14] <Cork> it would be something like jslint
[05:51:25] <Cork> but i don't think lint checks for sync ajax
[05:51:37] <dismist> then do your media query declarations to handle it on smaller screen sizes
[05:52:09] <dismist> swap those vals around though.  do width:100%; max-width:pixelvalue;
[05:52:55] <dismist> if there's not enough room for the defined size of the div, then it will drop to the next line, therefore anything beside it to the left will need to be at a defined width as well
[05:53:13] <zhulikas__> now to what i am actually doing...
[05:53:24] <zhulikas__> i'm having a side panel which expands
[05:53:41] <zhulikas__> so script expands panel by 200px and decreases content part by 200px
[05:53:46] <zhulikas__> and so it happens that it flickers
[05:53:49] <dismist> yeah so you will need to reduce the size of the right div when the left one is increased with js
[05:53:58] <dismist> though you could make the left side floated at a defined width
[05:54:28] <dismist> then if the right side follows in the markup and has no block level elements (such as images) wider than the width left after the panel expands, you could just make the right side display:block; with no width
[05:54:32] <dismist> and clear:none
[05:54:55] <dismist> or make the right side display:block; at 100%; then float the left div inside of the right
[05:54:58] <dismist> does that make sense
[05:55:36] <dismist> id need to see a working example... there's so many ways to tackle it
[05:55:41] <dismist> set up a jsfiddle and ping me if u want
[05:56:58] <zhulikas__> nah, thanks.
[05:57:14] <zhulikas__> i will try to tinker the widths of elements a bit
[05:57:23] <zhulikas__> not having it all at 100% all the time
[05:57:45] <zhulikas__> because jquery can't reliably resize them for me all at once
[05:58:40] <dismist> then your css will have to cover all the responsiveness you need for the js not to break it
[06:01:03] <zhulikas__> or maybe i need more javascript :D
[06:01:43] <dismist> yeah but for all im concerned you can suck it
[06:02:05] <dismist> and stop asking questions you already know the answers to or provide examples with your ambiguous problems
[06:04:25] <zhulikas__> right
[06:14:23] <sayhi> hello
[06:14:53] <Meir`> hello sayhi
[06:15:31] <sayhi> how would I select the next element <code> in a html like <div><code></code></div><p>foo</p><div><code>
[06:16:10] <sayhi> do I have to go to the parent first? then select the next div.. then the code element?
[06:16:15] <sayhi> or is there an easier way
[06:16:27] <Cork> sayhi: yes you have to go up to a level where the code exist
[06:17:03] <Meir`> sayhi you know for sure it's the inner and in 1st level?
[06:17:21] <sayhi> yes Meir`
[06:18:23] <Cork> sayhi: $(this).closest('div').nextAll('div').first().find('code')
[06:18:57] <Meir`> you can use ">"
[06:19:19] <Meir`> like "code > div > code"
[06:19:35] <Cork> Meir`: no you can't not if you want to find the next one
[06:19:54] <Cork> <div><code></code></div><div><code></code></div><div><code></code></div>
[06:20:02] <Cork> get from the second to the third
[06:20:06] <Meir`> but he said it's nested inside
[06:20:12] <sayhi> there could be a <div> inbetween without a <code> element
[06:20:29] <Cork> sayhi: you would have to add a class on the div then
[06:20:37] <sayhi> Cork s example seems to work in that case
[06:20:49] <sayhi> oh
[06:21:08] <Cork> cause you can't find the next div based on the content on the div
[06:21:13] <BarnaSzalai> Cork's examples always work haha :)
[06:21:20] <Cork> well actually you can
[06:21:26] <Cork> but it becomes really ugly
[06:21:42] <sayhi> the code element has a class
[06:21:56] <sayhi> the div as well.. but those are set by my CMS
[06:21:57] <Cork> var codes = $('code'); codes.eq(codes.index(this) + 1)
[06:22:23] <Meir`> sorry, i thought the <code> is enclosed in a parent <code>
[06:22:34] <Meir`> that's why pasting in channel is not so wise :)
[06:22:49] <sayhi> ye, sorry about that..
[06:22:57] <Cork> sayhi: make a jsfiddle with the exact html markup
[06:23:03] <sayhi> ok
[06:23:07] <Cork> i makes this much easier to answer
[06:25:32] <Meir`> Cork, i'm trying to use jquery ui "sortable" for storing a user preferation for order of fields
[06:26:19] <Meir`> do u recommend passing it as a serialized json to sql?
[06:26:43] <Cork> oooh, good question
[06:27:03] <Meir`> i thought also to pass it as POST to a php script
[06:27:04] <Cork> hmm i would prob use a separate table for it
[06:27:14] <Meir`> which will add indexes to the json array
[06:27:17] <Cork> but ya, if you only use it for this it might be ok
[06:27:23] <Meir`> but it should be per-user
[06:27:32] <Cork> not a big fan of gigantic text blobs in sql
[06:27:55] <Meir`> how would u use a separate table?
[06:28:37] <Meir`> if user User1 wants the order of "a b c x y z" and User 2 wants "c b a z y x"
[06:28:50] <Cork> |id|user_id|field|position|
[06:28:59] <Cork> or rather
[06:29:01] <Meir`> so that's the users table
[06:29:04] <Cork> |id|user_id|field_id|position|
[06:29:11] <Cork> no it would be a separate table
[06:29:21] <Meir`> oh, wait
[06:29:30] <Meir`> u mean to put each field_id in a row
[06:29:42] <Meir`> mm
[06:30:08] <Meir`> and then order by position where user_id = User1
[06:31:02] <Cork> fields joins fields_order where user_id = current_user_id and fields.id = fields_order.field_id
[06:31:03] <Meir`> so in the php script, i will loop on the serialized list with a counter, and store each one?
[06:31:06] <Cork> kinda semi sql
[06:31:45] <Cork> Meir`: it depends
[06:31:54] <Cork> if you only need it for this specific sort table
[06:31:59] <Cork> it might be over kill
[06:32:07] <Cork> but if you ever need to actually use it for anything
[06:32:17] <Cork> it is much better to have a table you can use as an order
[06:32:32] <Meir`> i'll explain shortly. i have a data table and user table, and there's a system for exporting data based on user filtering
[06:32:58] <Meir`> now, i want the user to be able to select which columns to export, and in which order
[06:33:18] <Meir`> and to have this preferation stored for his next login
[06:34:03] <Meir`> how would u do it?
[06:38:58] <Cork> Meir`: if you plan to use it for explorting from sql i would definitely create a separate table for it
[06:39:20] <Cork> else you will have a hell of a time exporting the data later
[06:40:15] <Meir`> by exporting i don't mean dumping the db
[06:40:20] <Meir`> hope it was clear
[06:40:34] <Meir`> it's a pdf report maker
[06:40:46] <Cork> no i meant SELECT * FROM ... ORDER BY ???
[06:40:48] <Meir`> and every user may decide his own fields and order
[06:41:14] <Cork> that query becomes impossible without a table with the data
[06:41:20] <Meir`> so for loading the "sortable
[06:41:41] <Meir`> i'll simply select field_id and order by position
[06:41:47] <Meir`> that's your idea?
[06:41:54] <Cork> no you select by user_id
[06:42:02] <Cork> and then grab the field_id
[06:42:02] <Meir`> where user_id=user
[06:42:05] <Meir`> of course
[06:42:16] <Cork> ordered by the position
[06:42:29] <Meir`> yeah
[06:42:34] <Meir`> makes sense
[06:42:37] <Meir`> thanks
[06:43:06] <Meir`> wait, and what about the fields *selection*?
[06:43:27] <Meir`> thought of using connectWith
[06:43:36] <Meir`> u're familiar with soratable, right?
[06:43:44] <Meir`> sortable*
[06:43:52] <Cork> i haven't used it in a long time
[06:43:58] <Cork> but ya, somewhat
[06:45:11] <sayhi> so I made a fiddle - the current javascript code is more or less the idea what i 'd like to do.. I know its wrong :p
[06:45:13] <sayhi> http://jsfiddle.net/o5gup1Lg/
[06:45:44] <sayhi> i'd like to go to the "next" code .language-javascript element.. and make that toggle current class
[06:46:25] <Meir`> damn my brain is tired
[06:46:47] <Meir`> Cork, i'm curious, how would u implement this?
[06:47:10] <Meir`> duplicate all fields for each user on a table?
[06:47:41] <Meir`> i mean for the "selected" to be true/false
[06:48:00] <Cork> Meir`: users: |id|name|, fields: |id|name|, field_orders: |id|user_id|field_id|position|
[06:48:17] <Cork> then to sort the fields you join the field_orders
[06:48:27] <Cork> and filter it by the user_id
[06:48:49] <sayhi> or use a cookie ?
[06:48:57] <Meir`> that's the order
[06:49:03] <Meir`> but what about the selection
[06:49:17] <Meir`> there are, for example, 10 fields in the main table
[06:49:27] <Meir`> and there can be a user that wants to export only 4
[06:49:41] <Cork> Meir`: only add the fields to the order table if it is selected
[06:49:46] <Cork> and remove it if it isn't in it
[06:50:06] <Cork> though you might want a better name on the table in that case
[06:50:30] <Cork> user_selected_fields: |id|user_id|field_id|position| for example
[06:50:42] <Meir`> the fields must be the exact column names of the data
[06:50:50] <Meir`> if i change a column name in future
[06:50:50] <Cork> so?
[06:50:59] <Cork> you just change the name in the fields table
[06:51:01] <Meir`> should i change this id|field table?
[06:51:21] <Meir`> is this acceptable in these cases?
[06:51:33] <Cork> acceptable?
[06:51:44] <sayhi> use a many-to-one relationship on data -> data_column_names
[06:51:48] <Meir`> i'm always trying to think of linking things to gether
[06:51:56] <sayhi> then reference the id - not the name
[06:52:23] <Meir`> sayhi, but the names play a role in my case
[06:52:30] <Meir`> since the user chooses by name
[06:53:05] <sayhi> Meir`: still.. offer the name but reference it by id
[06:53:09] <Meir`> sayhi, and about your html, i'll consider chaning the logic a bit
[06:53:13] <Meir`> changing*
[06:53:24] <Meir`> rather than selecting manually the 2nd
[06:53:33] <Meir`> something more based on id or class
[06:54:10] <sayhi> Meir`: im bound by my cms concerning the classes and id's
[06:54:51] <Meir`> i can see there can be also divs without <code>
[06:55:38] <sayhi> yes.. its a small tutorial on d3 - so theres code lines.. then explanations.. and again code lines
[06:55:56] <sayhi> I 'd like to eval the <code> bits.. on button click
[06:56:27] <sayhi> and I pick the code to eval with the .current class
[06:56:42] <Meir`> what about $( "code:eq(2)" ) ?
[06:56:53] <notchris> If I have a modal triggered by a link, how do I get the ID of the clicked link to be displayed as text inside the modal?
[06:56:55] <sayhi> so.. I just need the .current class to "jump" from code bit to code bit
[06:57:05] <Meir`> the 2nd occurence of <code> in whole page
[06:57:28] <sayhi> Meir`: oh? .. so I could keep a counter? and just select those?
[06:57:47] <Meir`> sayhi, why not enclosing the button in same div of the code?
[06:57:54] <Meir`> or in some kind of parent-child
[06:58:05] <Meir`> so u can simply access the closest() code
[06:58:31] <sayhi> that would be nice.. but I still need something to place the button on the next "code" bit
[06:59:45] <sayhi> also.. I might add code bits from other languages which should not eval() .. so im just looking for .language-javascript classes
[06:59:56] <sayhi> but if the thing with the counter works..
[07:00:22] <sayhi> I could just increment it every time a click occurs... and select the next  ".language-javascript"
[07:01:41] <Omar-> notchris var text = $(this).attr("id") or this.id or $(this)[0].id
[07:01:41] <Meir`> sayhi, select all <code> into some var
[07:01:53] <notchris> Omar-: Thanks man! I just figured it out, I’m sorry haha
[07:01:54] <Meir`> and you'll have a set of them
[07:02:03] <Meir`> than you can play with next and previous
[07:02:03] <Omar-> notchris np
[07:02:07] <Meir`> with eq()
[07:02:07] <notchris> Omar-: I used .prop(‘id’)
[07:02:13] <Meir`> then*
[07:02:14] <Omar-> notchris possible too
[07:02:24] <Omar-> notchris pure JS this.id
[07:02:39] <sayhi> that sounds good too Meir`
[07:02:48] <Omar-> hello Meir`
[07:02:49] <sayhi> thanks
[07:02:55] <Meir`> $("code").eq(index)
[07:03:34] <Meir`> or var codes = $("code"); and then $(codes).eq(index) ....
[07:03:54] <Meir`> hello Omar- :)
[07:03:57] <Meir`> sup?
[07:04:25] <sayhi> Meir`: concerning your 'personalized sorting' view - I'd recommend having 'column names' in a separate table - so you dont have to rely on the exact wordings
[07:04:39] <sayhi> Meir`: im actualy on a similar project atm. thats how I done it
[07:05:14] <Meir`> sayhi that's the idea, but in addition to sorting i plan to have selecting
[07:05:25] <Meir`> so each user will be able to select different columns
[07:06:49] <Meir`> sayhi, are you sure this whole "next" thing will be clear to the user?
[07:07:03] <Meir`> how will he know which code is currently evaluated?
[07:07:36] <sayhi> Meir`: im planning on placing the button next to the code -- and highlight the "current" code as well with that border
[07:08:11] <Meir`> if i were u, i definatly whould have used multiple buttons
[07:08:26] <sayhi> Meir`: the order of execution is important
[07:08:41] <sayhi> Meir`: the second bit could not work without the first bit
[07:08:42] <Meir`> so u can disable a button
[07:08:46] <Meir`> after it was pressed
[07:08:52] <sayhi> Meir`: ye.. I was thinking about that as well
[07:09:28] <Meir`> ok good luck anyway :)
[07:09:36] <sayhi> Meir`: the "column name selection" would be a many-to-many relationship from user to column-names
[07:09:37] <Meir`> have an idea for me about selecting fields?
[07:09:53] <sayhi> so.. pretty easy
[07:10:01] <sayhi> but - make sure you persist your data..
[07:10:18] <sayhi> so if a column is deleted.. you delete the "user selection" as well
[07:11:23] <sayhi> the user_view_selection table would just be:     user_id|column_name_id
[07:13:05] <Meir`> myabe i can combine it with ordering
[07:13:29] <Meir`> by adding another column of "position"
[07:21:28] <titii> Why the $.parseHTML( data) doesnt works for me? I cant explain that to my self... in the Ajax result i can see the right html content, then i use var html = $.parseHTML( data ); then alert($(html).html()); gives me the undefined, why? whats wrong?
[07:25:43] <Meir`> titii, some fiddle will help
[07:26:03] <Meir`> does the html contain head and body?
[07:26:12] <titii> Meir`: no
[07:28:16] <titii> i cant put the html into fiddle, it contain breaks
[07:29:50] <Meir`> titii, the ajax is responded as plain text?
[07:29:57] <Meir`> no any json arrays?
[07:30:33] <titii> Meir`: its plain/html i think, it result pure html content
[07:30:43] <Meir`> try to use console.log for this
[07:30:50] <Meir`> it will log any kind of object
[07:32:04] <titii> Meir`: the result semms like:  [<TextNode textContent="	">, div.list-cards-wrap, <TextNode textContent="\n ">, <TextNode textContent="\n">]
[07:33:56] <Meir`> what did u log?
[07:34:19] <titii> the HTMLparsed string
[07:35:21] <NoiseEee> log 'data'
[07:35:36] <Velveeta> if you're returning an html string, why not just run it immediately through the $() constructor?
[07:36:19] <Meir`> titii, in your first question "alert($(html).html());", html var was the parsed html?
[07:36:59] <Meir`> .parseHTML turns html markup to an array of elements
[07:37:19] <Meir`> i don't think u can call .html() on this array
[07:37:30] <bbclover> hey guys if you have a <select> dropdown, how do you get the selected <option> tag?
[07:37:44] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Do you need the value or the actual element?
[07:37:48] <workerbeetwo> j javascript
[07:37:51] <titii> Meir`: and something like $(html).find('.list-cards-wrap').length ?
[07:38:04] <BillCriswell> $('select').value() will return the value of the selected option.
[07:38:20] <BillCriswell> Er, .val()
[07:38:34] <bbclover> really
[07:38:49] <bbclover> it knows what is selected?
[07:42:39] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Yes.
[07:43:09] <baako> guys i have a function which get the device id but sometimes the id is has space it in so i tried using $.trim but it doesnt remove the space
[07:43:22] <baako> this is how i did it  var channel = pusher.subscribe ('client_' + deviceID + '_' + $.trim(deviceModel));
[07:44:44] <negusnegesti> Hello guys!
[07:44:44] <negusnegesti> I have a problem. In InternetExplorer with ajaxStart my .append to the body tag doesn't work. Any ideas what that issue can cause?
[07:44:44] <negusnegesti> No problems in firefox at all.
[07:44:58] <Meir`> baako, there's a space in deviceID or deviceModel?
[07:45:11] <baako> deviceModel
[07:45:26] <BillCriswell> baako: trim would remove spaces from the beginning and end, if you want to remove spaces in the middle you're need to use .replace
[07:47:14] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to change the value of a field depending on selections made in a popup window: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0202fe8f8f6ef99f1e1e
[07:47:30] <islalobo> What I have there actually disables the popup window from popping up
[07:51:22] <baako>  var channel = pusher.subscribe ('client_' + deviceID + '_' + .replace(/ /deviceModel, '')); unexpected .
[07:53:39] <BillCriswell> baako: You're using that wrong.
[07:53:55] <BillCriswell> deviceModel.replace(/\s/g, '')
[07:54:05] <baako> was gonna do that
[07:55:26] <BillCriswell> Yeah, don't forget the g.
[07:55:33] <BillCriswell> without it it'll only replace once.
[07:58:30] <[Non]> http://kutsalpenguen.com/realestate/#
[07:58:32] <[Non]> hi :/
[07:58:39] <[Non]> it keeps telling me on console unexpected identifier
[07:58:46] <[Non]> what is causing that problem and where can  i find it
[07:58:52] <[Non]> it says on line 1 but i dont get it
[07:59:24] <bbclover> does order for $.ajax matter?
[07:59:27] <bbclover> for the attributes?
[08:03:35] <islalobo> This change event isn't  working for me:https://gist.github.com/
[08:09:28] <BillCriswell> bbclover: You mean the properties in $.ajax({ here });?
[08:10:25] <bbclover> yeah
[08:10:55] <msize> I'm trying to figure out a way to check and see if something (be it text or image or whatever) exists after an image inside of a div. Can anyone recommend a solution? I could settle for just check if text (any text) exists after an image if the other is just not possible.
[08:13:12] <sayhi> msize: select the parent and .find() ?
[08:13:34] <BillCriswell> bbclover: The order does not matter.
[08:14:24] <msize> sayhi: Thanks. I'm not sure if that will work or maybe I'm just not thinking clearly. I can select parent and then do a find() to check if there's text, but I need to check and see if text exists after an img inside of the parent. If text exists, said img will get a class. If no text exists, then said img will get a different class.
[08:16:11] <sayhi> is the text nested ? in a <p> or something?
[08:19:43] <msize> sayhi: I guess another way to put it would be needing to check if an <img> is the last element inside of a div. If it is, then apply a class to that img. If it's not, then apply a different class to that img.
[08:19:52] <msize> sayhi: Yes, it's in a p tag
[08:20:31] <msize> sayhi: just as a quick example: https://dpaste.de/Jgka
[08:25:40] <[Non]> http://www.kutsalpenguen.com/realestate/pages/object%20HTMLDivElement.html.
[08:25:46] <[Non]> its giving me this error message on ajax
[08:25:54] <[Non]> i was trying to send parameter in the ajax url
[08:38:57] <ashgotti> Hello everyone. I'm having trouble with a simple script to move a div if hte screen size < X. It works for resize but not when the page loads < X. http://pastebin.com/nBKYrGqq
[08:39:51] <Armed_Mosquito> hello
[08:40:07] <Armed_Mosquito> Can someone assist me I am working a client and could use a bit of help on a searching issue
[08:40:38] <Demonen> Armed_Mosquito: Can you be slightly more specific, perhaps?
[08:40:38] <Armed_Mosquito> http://clients.trendypixels.net/moniker/ as you see if you type domainname it will search those results what I want
[08:41:17] <Armed_Mosquito> Im trying to get it so you type domain name in the search area then from their the results it pulls up should add the hard coded .com for the results
[08:41:18] <Omar-> ashgotti your code should be wrapped in $(function () { code }); or $(document).ready(fucntion() { code });
[08:41:20] <Armed_Mosquito> does that make sense?
[08:41:43] <ashgotti> Omar- I'm using drupal and that wrapper invokes that function
[08:42:41] <Armed_Mosquito> So if you type in the search at that link above hello the result should be hello.com and not just hello as its currently doing
[08:42:46] <Omar-> ashgotti i dont know about drupal. However, AFAIK to run jquery code on load, juts wrap code in .ready
[08:43:23] <ashgotti> Omar- Thank you. The (function($){ X})(jQuery); is drupal's integration of .ready
[08:43:33] <ashgotti> The resize function I have works.
[08:43:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not a document ready ;)
[08:43:58] <robertmaxrees> that's just an IIFE that ensures you can use $ instead of jQuery
[08:44:04] <Omar-> ashgotti this is call IIFE
[08:44:07] <Omar-> called*
[08:44:16] <Omar-> robertmaxrees +1
[08:44:25] <ashgotti> Omar & Robertmaxrees: Oops, my misunderstanding
[08:44:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[08:44:37] <robertmaxrees> it's a semi-common misconception.
[08:44:50] <Omar-> ?g IIFE
[08:44:51] <b-ot> Omar-: Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) → http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[08:45:18] <Armed_Mosquito> Did I write that question out ok? Should I provide a better source to the jquery
[08:46:14] <Omar-> Armed_Mosquito are you using auto-complete?
[08:46:57] <Armed_Mosquito> no
[08:47:03] <LiENUS> anyone done interception of shift clicking links?
[08:47:14] <LiENUS> my users are shift double clicking instead of just shift click
[08:47:36] <LiENUS> which causes it to perform both my shift click action AND open the href in a new window
[08:47:39] <ashgotti> I updated my function to include $(document).ready and now neitehr functions work http://pastebin.com/B3HnPzPd
[08:47:40] <Demonen> Armed_Mosquito: I'm having trouble grasping what part of your code is misbehaving.  What happens and what did you expect to happen?  Where?
[08:47:42] <LiENUS> even using e.preventDefault
[08:48:12] <Armed_Mosquito> What I the client is asking is to make this search in a hardcoded form of say you type test for your search
[08:48:18] <Omar-> ashgotti remove (function($) {})(jQuery);
[08:48:29] <Armed_Mosquito> he wants it to always show test.com rather then having the end user type .com
[08:48:40] <Armed_Mosquito> but he wants it to be the primary search and not the only either
[08:48:52] <Armed_Mosquito> the problem being that right now it searches all of them
[08:49:17] <Omar-> Armed_Mosquito $("select").on("keyup", function () ( $(this).val( $(this).val() +  )
[08:49:27] <Omar-> Armed_Mosquito $("select").on("keyup", function () ( $(this).val( $(this).val() + ".com" ); });
[08:49:29] <Omar-> sorry
[08:49:37] <ashgotti> Omar- Thanks, nothing happens still. I put an console.log as line 2 and it doesn't show.
[08:50:10] <Armed_Mosquito> thank you I will try it out no way to append the text instead?
[08:50:13] <Armed_Mosquito> what if they copy and paste it
[08:50:49] <Omar-> Armed_Mosquito or use "input" instead of "keyup"
[08:50:55] <Uhkis> ashgotti: how about just using jQuery instead of $
[08:51:08] <Armed_Mosquito> ah ok ty
[08:51:18] <ashgotti> Ukhis: Tried that also
[08:51:19] <Armed_Mosquito> omar can you direct me in where i place that?
[08:52:15] <[Non]> hi
[08:52:19] <[Non]> http://kutsalpenguen.com/realestate/#
[08:52:27] <[Non]> could you look at the menu under the About Us on the left..
[08:52:47] <[Non]> i was sending a parameter with getcontent so i can load page content but
[08:52:54] <[Non]> when i send getcontent(wwus) it dont defined
[08:53:02] <[Non]> but when i send getcontent(aboutus) there is no problem at all
[08:53:03] <[Non]> why is that?
[08:53:04] <Omar-> Armed_Mosquito sorry, my code is wrong
[08:53:23] <Armed_Mosquito> o no resolution for it?
[08:53:36] <Omar-> Armed_Mosquito there is of course
[08:54:18] <robertmaxrees> [Non] you have a syntax error you need to fix first.
[08:54:26] <[Non]> where
[08:54:37] <robertmaxrees> that series of settimeout calls in main.js
[08:54:50] <[Non]> :/
[08:55:02] <robertmaxrees> open your console and check it out.
[08:55:18] <robertmaxrees> that'll cause things to bomb out on you.
[08:55:48] <robertmaxrees> you've also got a buch of global vars you might want to clean up.
[08:56:11] <[Non]> but where
[08:56:32] <robertmaxrees> activeItem and getUrl on first glance.
[08:57:07] <MajorT> I can pass an iDoc variable to JS but i can't seem to pass a JS string to iDoc? Have any of you 750+ wonderful people come across idoc? Or better yet managed to do this?
[08:57:34] <Armed_Mosquito> here is a snippet of code
[08:57:54] <[Non]> this is some fckd up code ha
[08:58:05] <Armed_Mosquito> http://pastebin.com/sG7MNmVy
[08:58:26] <Armed_Mosquito> is this like the spot I should be in to make .com or w.e extension i want as default
[08:59:04] <robertmaxrees> [Non] you're also doing some really unusual things, like that activeItem = this; at the end of one of your event handlers.
[08:59:40] <Omar-> Armed_Mosquito something like thi http://jsfiddle.net/4jff5nyp/
[08:59:50] <Omar-> of course you need also to handle backspace
[09:00:00] <robertmaxrees> also, you're doing setInterval() inside of setTimeout(), which is really going to get messy.
[09:00:18] <robertmaxrees> and I kind of get why you're doing it, but that's not really what you want in this case.
[09:01:38] <[Non]> i see
[09:01:42] <[Non]> i have to fix so much things
[09:01:46] <Armed_Mosquito> doesnt appear to work omar :(
[09:02:04] <Omar-> Armed_Mosquito the fiddle?
[09:02:11] <Armed_Mosquito> no on my site
[09:02:17] <[Non]> you are an angel robertmaxrees - thank you :)
[09:02:32] <robertmaxrees> [Non] hahahaha.  what editor are you using btw?
[09:02:36] <[Non]> sublime
[09:02:38] <Armed_Mosquito> should I change keydown to input
[09:02:46] <robertmaxrees> [Non] check out jshint gutter.
[09:02:54] <Omar-> Armed_Mosquito you have to try over and over until you nail it ;)
[09:03:39] <Armed_Mosquito> huh
[09:03:50] <Armed_Mosquito> thats the process im in now
[09:03:52] <robertmaxrees> feel free to cop this config for it, too: https://gist.github.com/robertmaxrees/2bf82aaca2039b9c9a50
[09:03:56] <K4T> hi
[09:04:10] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of opinionated, but it should get you started in the right direction.
[09:04:58] <Armed_Mosquito> thanks anyhow omar :)
[09:05:09] <[Non]> thank you robertmaxreesi im trying to do something here..
[09:05:19] <[Non]> not complicated but, must be true way to did it for starter (:
[09:07:46] <[Non]> finally, undefined error is gone :D
[09:07:52] <robertmaxrees> awesome :)
[09:07:56] <[Non]> now that
[09:08:04] <[Non]> wwus - aboutus problem is hitting me again!
[09:08:14] <Omar-> Armed_Mosquito you're welcome and i'm sorry forr not being able to assist you.
[09:08:27] <robertmaxrees> [Non] did you fix the sytax error?
[09:08:49] <[Non]> is that some syntax error on getcontent function?
[09:09:09] <robertmaxrees> i don't remember exactly where it was, but it looks like it went away.
[09:09:27] <[Non]> yes that was in settimeout and setinternal like you said
[09:09:32] <[Non]> but what i dont understand is this;
[09:09:53] <[Non]> onclick doesnt even send the parameter i typed
[09:10:02] <Armed_Mosquito> its ok omar your script works but thats not the same method im thinking of for the client
[09:10:07] <robertmaxrees> [Non] which "onclick"?
[09:10:19] <Armed_Mosquito> id prefer if i can make that work by them submiting the search and it adds it to the query
[09:10:22] <[Non]> li><a onclick="getContent(wwus)">Work With Us</a></li>
[09:10:25] <[Non]> under the about
[09:10:26] <[Non]> menu
[09:10:33] <robertmaxrees> don't use that.
[09:10:39] <robertmaxrees> put your code in main.js instead.
[09:10:49] <[Non]> i did but i have to understand which menu is clicked
[09:10:59] <robertmaxrees> you can do that in your code pretty easily.
[09:11:02] <[Non]> when you click work with us, i must understand this an set the getUrl for that page
[09:11:06] <[Non]> how?
[09:11:32] <robertmaxrees> start by giving it a class or ID instead.
[09:12:24] <[Non]> and am i have to going to on click everyitem?
[09:12:33] <[Non]> write a event for every class i mean
[09:12:33] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:12:37] <robertmaxrees> no onclick at all.
[09:12:39] <robertmaxrees> let me show you in a fiddle.
[09:12:50] <Zzaichik> ^^ haha awesome.
[09:14:02] <pilgrimish> http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/?page_id=136 - image resizing works in safari/firefox, but not in chrome… any thoughts?
[09:15:24] <robertmaxrees> [Non] http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xppuqvvy/
[09:16:00] <[Non]> god damn it
[09:16:02] <robertmaxrees> this uses a delegated event listener on the UL.
[09:16:04] <[Non]> i have to work
[09:16:14] <[Non]> harder :)
[09:16:15] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple idea otherwise.
[09:16:26] <[Non]> thank you robertmaxrees, yes that was pretty damn easy :D
[09:16:39] <robertmaxrees> also your openLang function doesn't work right.
[09:16:51] <robertmaxrees> needs to be function openLang(e) { for that preventDefault() line t work.
[09:17:07] <[Non]> i see, so i wanna ask you something irrevelant
[09:17:13] <robertmaxrees> sure
[09:17:17] <[Non]> i understand right but it doesnt hurt to be hear again
[09:17:25] <[Non]> when and why are we using preventDefault
[09:18:15] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault() prevents the default action of an event.  let's say you want to bind a listener to a link that does something instead of taking you to a new page or to that ID on the current page - preventDefault() stops that from happening.
[09:18:29] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/ for more.
[09:19:11] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm using a hidden input field as storage but I'm having trouble appending items to it: http://jsfiddle.net/gjr2ke8m/
[09:19:38] <robertmaxrees> checkit that's now how you do that.
[09:19:47] <cjohnson> push is a method for arrays
[09:19:59] <robertmaxrees> you're "pushing" into the jquery object instead of the value.
[09:20:10] <robertmaxrees> you want to stringify the object and set the input's value to it.
[09:20:15] <[Non]> holy shit
[09:20:16] <[Non]> :D
[09:20:25] <[Non]> js hint says: dude! what the hell
[09:21:31] <robertmaxrees> checkit http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gjr2ke8m/1/
[09:21:31] <checkit> robertmaxrees: So how I implement this correctly...
[09:21:36] <robertmaxrees> *
[09:21:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:21:37] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:21:58] <K4T> $('#test').html() will return content of #test element. But how I can return THAT element with its content?
[09:22:21] <cjohnson> outer
[09:22:22] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Thank you. Will that allow me to append several objects at array 0 then 1 then 2 and so on?
[09:22:41] <sacho> K4T, "that"?
[09:22:46] <cjohnson> .get(0).outerHTML *
[09:25:06] <K4T> sacho: <div id="test"><p class="content"> bzzz </p></div>  $('#test').html() will return only p element. I need whole #test div
[09:26:06] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Although I that is much closer to what I'm looking for but I need to be able to "push" or in some way append several of those same objects to that array.
[09:26:39] <K4T> ok, I found solution
[09:26:40] <[Non]> its working like a charm now! thanks to robertmaxrees..
[09:27:07] <cjohnson> K4T: outerHTML
[09:27:13] <robertmaxrees> checkit sorry was just out for a second.
[09:27:20] <robertmaxrees> checkit that's not an array.
[09:28:24] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Is there a way the code you provided can be modified to accomplish what I'm trying achieve?
[09:28:24] <robertmaxrees> checkit you need to build up an object and then do a JSON.stringfy() on it and slap it into that value on submit OR you have to JSON.parse() it, add your stuff, and then do a final JSON.stringify() when you're done.
[09:28:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see a more fleshed out example of what you need.
[09:28:50] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Okay, thank you.
[09:31:08] <robertmaxrees> checkit when would you add more to that object?
[09:32:09] <checkit> robertmaxrees: For instance, in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/gjr2ke8m/2/ I'd like to be able additional entries to be appended to the list. I'm going to foreach through them on the server side for processing. Does that make sense?
[09:32:41] <robertmaxrees> but if it's a submit event, why would you need to append anything else?
[09:33:19] <robertmaxrees> also, you're mixing arrays and objects up, it looks like.
[09:33:43] <Duvdevan> hi
[09:33:49] <Duvdevan> anyone uses html5 geolocation api?
[09:34:02] <robertmaxrees> lots of people do :)
[09:35:01] <checkit> robertmaxrees: The submit event is posting the form to any location. I just want to compile a list of family members in a household. Ultimately, there is another submit button that will advance the visitor to the next step.
[09:35:27] <checkit> robertmaxrees: The array/object issue is likley due to the fact that I'm a much better backend developer than a frontend developer.
[09:35:38] <EchoBravo> Hi there, is this the right place for jQuery-ui questions as well?
[09:35:42] <robertmaxrees> EchoBravo yep.
[09:35:44] <[Non]> damn!
[09:35:53] <[Non]> http://kutsalpenguen.com/realestate/# i just want to add "selected" class :(
[09:35:57] <[Non]> when click on the item
[09:36:07] <robertmaxrees> checkit :) so the way i'd do this is to modify an object, instead of form values.
[09:36:14] <robertmaxrees> [Non] that's not helpful.
[09:36:25] <robertmaxrees> where on the page do you want this to happen?
[09:36:27] <EchoBravo> thanks robertmaxrees! :)
[09:36:34] <[Non]> "about us" section
[09:36:47] <[Non]> when click li element(you gave me the code) im trying to add class but
[09:36:54] <[Non]> its adding class, it brokes everything else
[09:36:56] <robertmaxrees> [Non] do it in the fiddle first.
[09:37:23] <robertmaxrees> also your ajax call is breaking things.
[09:37:40] <robertmaxrees> you're stomping all over the entire .contentAbout section when that finishes.
[09:38:13] <checkit> robertmaxrees: How would I go implementing that then?
[09:38:13] <EchoBravo> So, I am trying to make a jquery-ui autocomplete with some data that is in an array of objects. The data I want to show lies in: response.data[key-in-array].name - How do I accomplish showing that?
[09:39:36] <robertmaxrees> checkit not sure which part you're lost on :) could you flesh out the markup a little more to show what you've got?
[09:41:14] <robertmaxrees> because it really looks like you just need to compile everything together in the submit event like you already are.
[09:41:26] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Sure... I'll build it out more.
[09:46:03] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Does this markup better illustrate what I'm trying to do?
[09:46:05] <checkit> http://jsfiddle.net/gjr2ke8m/3/
[09:47:25] <[Non]> okay now i have to understand this:
[09:47:39] <[Non]> i wanna add class when is clicked, but i want to delete that class when clicked other element
[09:50:21] <NoiseEee> whenClicked = deleteClassFromEverythingThatCouldPossiblyeHaveIt(); addClassToThisElementOnly(); @ [Non]
[09:50:48] <[Non]> and here some sense of humor:)
[09:52:57] <NoiseEee> well thats the idea
[09:53:01] <NoiseEee> YOU figure out the code
[09:53:05] <[Non]> yeah
[09:53:08] <[Non]> thanks
[09:53:52] <robertmaxrees> checkit so you want to have an array where you add family membets?
[09:53:54] <robertmaxrees> *members?
[09:53:58] <robertmaxrees> each index is another member?
[09:54:04] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Yes sir :)
[09:54:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, let me show you the other way to do this.
[09:54:34] <checkit> robertmaxrees: I would greatly appreciate that.
[09:57:08] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to get this to validate but ignore case sensitivity https://gist.github.com/anonymous/29a7cc06f4f5fe3c9877
[09:57:58] <[Non]> http://kutsalpenguen.com/realestate/#
[09:58:04] <[Non]> just go down
[09:58:08] <robertmaxrees> [Non] please start using jsfiddle :)
[09:58:13] <[Non]> and click about us 2 time
[09:58:19] <[Non]> robertmaxrees - live isnt better? :/
[09:58:28] <[Non]> function is this : $('.aboutmenu ul').on('click',
[09:58:40] <robertmaxrees> we have to swim through the rest of your code and you're asking questions about the same things repeatedly.
[09:58:42] <[Non]> i tried every way, i put removeclass in success it keeps doing this
[09:59:44] <[Non]> no, this isnt the same question, i dont want any code, i want to work my code straight. just that. igive you the function name in main.js its like plunkr, just 1 page 1 js. however you could see magic happens when you click on the about us
[10:00:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:00:10] <robertmaxrees> whatever duder.
[10:00:39] <[Non]> click twice and see why am i struggle for :D
[10:01:00] <Jabberwock> Is there like a rounded-rectangle box in jqm?
[10:01:02] <robertmaxrees> we generally ask for isolated test cases which is why i suggested that
[10:01:04] <Jabberwock> Just to throw some content in
[10:01:24] <robertmaxrees> checkit http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gjr2ke8m/4/
[10:01:26] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[10:01:57] <robertmaxrees> basically, create an array (familyMembers in this case) that you keep pushing objects into, then do a single JSON.stringify() with that object.
[10:02:19] <robertmaxrees> [Non] you have another major error now.
[10:02:23] <robertmaxrees>  jQuery.easing[jQuery.easing.def] is not a function
[10:02:37] <ciqsteve> Q:  I have a form with a textarea.  works fine chrome desktop.. chrome ios if the textarea loses focus I'm unable to regain focus by touching the textarea... any ideas?
[10:02:43] <[Non]> yes and its broke site's slider and everything
[10:02:49] <robertmaxrees> [Non] so fix the error.
[10:04:35] <nettoweb> guys, is it possible to pass parameters to a click method call? $('.login-button').click(parameters);
[10:04:36] <nettoweb> ?
[10:04:52] <robertmaxrees> nettoweb yes, using .bind()
[10:05:12] <robertmaxrees> *native javascript bind, not jquery bind.
[10:06:02] <nettoweb> robertmaxrees is there an option with jqueyr?
[10:06:48] <robertmaxrees> nettoweb not unless you use an anonymous function to call the function.  .bind() is super easy to use.
[10:07:17] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, don't pass args to the event handler - what's the issue you're having?
[10:08:04] <pilgrimish> http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/?page_id=136 - image resizing works in safari/firefox, but not in chrome… any thoughts?
[10:08:14] <EchoBravo> Does anyone know of a bootstrap theme for jquery ui?
[10:08:29] <nettoweb> robertmaxrees What Im trying to do is: by clicking in one link, I check some things and then call $('.another').click(); this click function Im using with on(). I'll try to gist the code
[10:08:31] <robertmaxrees> EchoBravo that... doesn't make much sense :)
[10:08:55] <robertmaxrees> nettoweb are you trying to run an event handler when you do that click?
[10:09:06] <EchoBravo> robertmaxrees: Err, so a (twitter) bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) theme for jquery ui? (Does that make more sense? :) )
[10:09:26] <robertmaxrees> EchoBravo the core premise is... odd.  you'd normally use one or the other, not both.
[10:10:11] <EchoBravo> robertmaxrees: They accomplish very different things..?
[10:10:25] <robertmaxrees> depending on what you're doing - what are you using each for?
[10:10:46] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap has a grid ab a bunch of reusable widgets.  jquery ui has a bunch of reusable widgets.  see the overlap?
[10:11:11] <EchoBravo> imo: "bikes have wheels, airplanes have wheels"
[10:11:17] <EchoBravo> But that's besides the point :D
[10:11:27] <robertmaxrees> bad comparison ;)
[10:11:30] <EchoBravo> I want to make the autocomplete widget fit into the bootstrap theme :)
[10:11:56] <robertmaxrees> there any reason you're not using typeahead.js instead?
[10:12:11] <EchoBravo> Didn't know about it :D
[10:12:17] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll probably want to roll all of your own styles to make those two compatible.
[10:12:23] <nettoweb> robertmaxrees https://gist.github.com/osnysantos/562f6b0298e1cbdbb238 when I click in .toggle-tag I check if Im logged, if not, I call another click method, but I'd like to pass some parameters
[10:12:35] <EchoBravo> Whokai, thanks robertmaxrees
[10:13:08] <robertmaxrees> nettoweb there are two ways to do this, one that's "meh" and another that's smart.
[10:13:49] <nettoweb> robertmaxrees could you tell me? Im trying to improve some interation on my page
[10:13:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm doing it now.
[10:14:01] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[10:14:08] <nettoweb> robertmaxrees thank you
[10:14:38] <nettoweb> robertmaxrees because I want to pass the reference of the link I'm clicking
[10:15:03] <robertmaxrees> you already have that reference in the event object.
[10:15:24] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/s96ueu6/
[10:15:31] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want instead.
[10:15:47] <robertmaxrees> if you want to reference the clicked element, you either want $(this) OR $(e.target) within those handlers.
[10:17:58] <nettoweb> robbyoconnor thank you. I'll check
[10:18:04] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete :)
[10:19:38] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Thank you for your help w/ my issue. I was able to modify your script a bit to accomplish what I'm trying to do.
[10:20:16] <robertmaxrees> awesome - glad to hear!
[10:32:48] <checkit> robertmaxrees: This is what I have so far but I need to figure out how to access the key of current member in family to put in the <tr data-family-member="" field. This will be used to remove the item from the object in the even a mistake is made.
[10:32:52] <checkit> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dab7dceadbf5d69f7f96
[10:33:51] <robertmaxrees> checkit are you trying to access one of the family members?
[10:34:35] <robertmaxrees> sorry, your question seems simple - member.type, member, firstName, etc.
[10:34:39] <robertmaxrees> *member.firstName
[10:35:34] <Katharsis> do you know any WYSIWYG editor which has LaTeX support?
[10:35:49] <robertmaxrees> checkit aaaah you want the index that the current family member was added at!
[10:37:27] <bbclover> so i see often in jquery people select things like $('#whatever') but aren't single quotes usually for characters (maybe $('a'))? I guess javascript/jquery doesn't treat them any differently
[10:37:42] <robertmaxrees> bbclover that IS a string.
[10:37:47] <robertmaxrees> selectors are strings.
[10:38:05] <bbclover> yeah, but for good style shouldn't you use double quotes not single quotes
[10:38:10] <robertmaxrees> i always use singles.
[10:38:14] <robertmaxrees> lots of people prefer them.
[10:38:14] <bbclover> like in C if you tried to do that you'll get errors
[10:38:19] <robertmaxrees> others like doubles.
[10:38:44] <apipkin> I’m wanting to create a widget that can be instantiated by calling the name like `new Bottle()` and not have to attach it to the dom with `$(selector).bottle()`. Is this something I can do with Widget Factory?
[10:38:45] <jakesy> JSON wants double quotes. javascript doesn't care
[10:38:46] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Yes. I am looking for the index.
[10:39:22] <robertmaxrees> checkit so .push() returns the length - you want that value - 1 for the index you added your thing to.
[10:39:44] <robertmaxrees> jakesy that's partially because JSON isn't JavaScript :D
[10:40:16] <jakesy> I still can't believe that ubuntu doesn't ship with git. boggles.
[10:40:39] <robertmaxrees> checkit or to be less implicit - family.push(member); var currentindex = family.length - 1;
[10:48:33] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Oh okay...
[10:49:54] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i'd reconsider the array entirely and swap to a normal object instead so you can have named keys you can access with.
[10:50:18] <robertmaxrees> or make a simple accessor function so you can find things in your array by a value in those objects, though that's kind of hacky.
[10:50:42] <checkit> robertmaxrees: That may not be a good idea because of possible name collisions. I like the incremental index for this.
[10:51:09] <robertmaxrees> you could come up with something like type-fname-lname
[10:51:23] <robertmaxrees> but i could see collisions being an issue.
[10:52:00] <robertmaxrees> funky.  are you ever going to remove things from the array?
[10:52:43] <checkit> robertmaxrees: I'd like the user to have the ability.
[10:53:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then storing the index won't work because indexes can change.
[10:53:11] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to find another way to reference each object.
[10:55:05] <baako> hi guys why isn't http://kopy.io/B2KJ1 remove after 5 seconds
[10:55:11] <baako> ?
[10:55:24] <robertmaxrees> because you're removing it and then setting a delay of 5 seconds.
[10:55:37] <baako> i also tried it the other way
[10:55:46] <quansai> hey
[10:55:58] <robertmaxrees> you want to use native setTimeout, baako
[10:56:01] <BillCriswell> plus delay won't work unless it's chained to an animation or promise or something or whatever.
[10:56:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:56:09] <robertmaxrees> the docs cover it.
[10:56:31] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[10:56:34] <quansai> Is there anything against using jQuery's .load() to reload a div?
[10:56:56] <kokut> Hello, is it possible to add an ajax call to an element that was created by an ajax call?
[10:57:20] <BillCriswell> What do you mean "add an ajax call to an element"?
[10:57:47] <kokut> i have a list that when the user selects a value it calls another script that gets another list and puts it under it
[10:58:08] <baako> BillCriswell:  setTimeout( "jQuery('#messages').removeClass();",3000 );
[10:58:09] <kokut> its to select a category from a category tree, so far its working but i need another level
[10:58:34] <BillCriswell> baako: No.
[10:58:48] <BillCriswell> setTimeout(function () { jQuery('#messages').removeClass(); }, 3000);
[10:59:12] <BillCriswell> kokut: Sounds like you want even delegation.
[10:59:32] <islalobo> I'm adding jquery.alphanum-master to my drupal /all/libraries to prevent special characters from being able to be entered into a field. However, I'm not sure what I should rename 'jquery.alphanumeric-master' to...
[10:59:55] <BillCriswell> Assuming you're working with a list do something like $('.categories').on('click', '.category', function () { });
[11:00:11] <BillCriswell> Where categories is the container and a category is a leaf.
[11:00:34] <notchris> How do I reload a script>
[11:00:42] <notchris> Like say I’ve loaded someones coordinates
[11:00:51] <notchris> How can I reload the current coordinates upon a click action
[11:00:57] <notchris> Can I re-run a script?
[11:01:43] <quansai> Anyone?
[11:01:43] <BillCriswell> Do you want to use watchPosition?
[11:04:28] <BillCriswell> notchris: Also, calling getCurrentPosition() again would work just fine.
[11:04:49] <notchris> BillCriswell: Thank you!
[11:05:45] <kokut> BillCriswell: what is even delegation
[11:06:26] <BillCriswell> kokut: You're essentially listening for an event on a parent (something that's always there) coming from a child (which might not always be there)
[11:06:40] <Toerkeium> hello people
[11:06:48] <kokut> BillCriswell: yea how do i do that
[11:06:54] <baako> BillCriswell: what is the best way to do it? wen i use removeclass the data in that div still exists so i changed to .hide() but if i exists the ajax again, the div with that message class doesn't show up
[11:07:19] <BillCriswell> kokut: I gave you the code.
[11:07:46] <BillCriswell> $('.static-parent').on('click', '.some-child', function () { /* `this` will be the .some-child clicked */ });
[11:07:47] <kokut> where?
[11:08:03] <BillCriswell> Really?
[11:08:45] <Toerkeium> I have to implement a menu->submenues permissions selection for users, and I'm thinking on 2 "boxes" containing the "allowed menu" and "disabled menu", with a 2 arrow button to pass one item from one box to another and enable disable respectively. Do you know what can I use to accomplish that? I want to list the "menu" in black and "submenues" followed menu on a kindof box scrollable, is it possible?
[11:08:46] <kokut> yea so far it looks like that man
[11:09:56] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to prevent the use of special characters in a text field and I had issue trying to add jquery alphanum
[11:10:07] <quansai> Is there anything against using jQuery's .load() to reload a div? Anyone?
[11:10:19] <BillCriswell> quansai: No.
[11:10:35] <quansai> BillCriswell: Thanks.
[11:10:35] <BillCriswell> kokut: Whereever you have your current script.
[11:12:15] <notchris> BillCriswell: Is there any easy way to see a plugins available commands?
[11:12:20] <notchris> or functions, ect..
[11:12:20] <baako> BillCriswell: any ideas?
[11:14:22] <BillCriswell> notchris: Hopefully the documentation. There's no set standards for where those options might live.
[11:15:11] <BillCriswell> notchris: Slight chance it might be available at jQuery.fn.pluginName.defaults
[11:16:09] <BillCriswell> but if the default decided to name defaults something else it would be that obviously.
[11:17:54] <BillCriswell> but if the plugin*
[11:19:04] <notchris> BillCriswell: I’m using: https://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/geolocation.html
[11:19:14] <notchris> Any idea on how I could refresh the coordinates it gets?
[11:19:20] <notchris> I’m not using the map portion
[11:19:24] <notchris> Only getting coordinates
[11:19:39] <notchris> BillCriswell: Here’s my version: http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/guides/
[11:21:34] <BillCriswell> I don't know what this is doing that the out of the box navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() can't.
[11:21:56] <BillCriswell> notchris: There's only 4 options there that you should be messing with (at the bottom right).
[11:22:01] <notchris> BillCriswell: Hmm
[11:22:08] <notchris> you mean
[11:22:11] <notchris> I don’t need gmaps
[11:22:17] <notchris> I should just use the API?
[11:22:30] <BillCriswell> As far as I can tell. I don't know all your needs haha
[11:26:26] <BillCriswell> notchris: http://jsbin.com/vusagi/1/edit?html,js,output as far as I can tell you want something like this.
[11:29:08] <notchris> BillCriswell: <3
[11:39:43] <TrentonDAdams> I'm having a problem with jQuery calendar UI.  I can't figure out why the beforeShow, when accessing the instance's getDate(), it throws an error... http://jsfiddle.net/vse6xj64/4/
[11:41:47] <Katharsis> http://pbrd.co/1zkWLG0 why CKEEditor is looking like that?
[11:45:49] <BillCriswell> TrentonDAdams: Your array seems off.
[11:46:31] <BillCriswell> Well, actually, you're not returning anything unless there's a match.
[11:46:49] <krisfremen> hello, I'm using jquery 1.10.2, and IE9 seems to be silently dropping requests to any url that has a scheme
[11:47:11] <BillCriswell> TrentonDAdams: http://jsfiddle.net/vse6xj64/5/
[11:47:18] <krisfremen> so if I do http://domain or https://domain or even //domain, it won't work, but if I do plain 'domain.com' it works
[11:47:39] <krisfremen> IE9 console seems to say that readyState is 0 when using scheme
[11:47:52] <krisfremen> otherwise it's 1 when not using a scheme for any url
[11:51:37] <Katharsis> http://pbrd.co/1zkWLG0 why CKEEditor is looking like that?
[11:52:15] <robertMeeting> Katharsis might have more luck in a channel about ckeeditor
[11:52:30] <BillCriswell> Katharsis: I think it's broke.
[11:52:37] <robertMeeting> or by giving us a functioning example.
[11:53:18] <Katharsis> robertMeeting: there is no ckeeditor channel
[11:53:38] <Katharsis> BillCriswell: its from official repo
[11:53:49] <robertMeeting> Katharsis that doesn't change the topic of this channel ;)
[11:53:59] <robertMeeting> hard for us to help with just a picture, either way.
[11:54:03] <BillCriswell> Katharsis: You're making it hard for people to help you. We can't debug something by looking at a picture of it.
[11:55:10] <Katharsis> but there is no info (bugs) in console
[11:55:24] <robertMeeting> Katharsis how do you expect us to help with juist a picture?
[11:55:25] <Katharsis> so, how can I be more specific?
[11:55:41] <robertMeeting> make a jsfiddle.
[11:56:03] <BillCriswell> Katharsis: We don't know if you did something insane with the css, if there is actually an error that you're missing, if you forgot a stylesheet.. there's so many things it can be.
[11:56:57] <Katharsis> I agree
[12:05:17] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell, Sorry, I did not update the code, that was old code.  Here's the one that's not working... http://jsfiddle.net/vse6xj64/6/
[12:05:45] <notchris> BillCriswell: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/elevation
[12:05:49] <notchris> This is killing me
[12:06:01] <notchris> I’m struggling to get the users current elevation
[12:06:10] <surfdue> It's not the only thing killing you.
[12:06:22] * surfdue slashes notchris with a sword of infinite Chris.
[12:06:29] <notchris> :(
[12:06:59] <surfdue> Is current elevation based off the core of the earth, sea level, or what?
[12:07:02] <surfdue> Sea level is variable.
[12:07:08] <notchris> Yes it is
[12:07:24] <notchris> But I’m pretty sure the web api doesn’t provide this
[12:07:29] <surfdue> Yes to a multi-option question will just get you kicked off who wants to be a millionaire.
[12:07:30] <notchris> Only google elevation api
[12:07:43] <notchris> sea level
[12:07:44] <notchris> Sorry
[12:08:51] <BillCriswell> notchris: It's in the callback for getCurrentPosition
[12:08:59] <notchris> Really?
[12:09:29] <surfdue> So let me get this right, it returns your elevation based on the current sea level in your area?
[12:09:45] <surfdue> Is this dependent on the moons cycles? Quite confusing if I had to say.
[12:10:41] <BillCriswell> I named the response poorly, but here it is a little more clearly: http://jsbin.com/vusagi/3/edit?html,js,output
[12:10:57] <surfdue> Due to equatorial bulge, there is debate as to which of the summits of Mt. Everest or Chimborazo is at the higher elevation, as the Chimborazo summit is further from the Earth's center, while the Mt. Everest summit is higher above mean sea level.
[12:11:02] <surfdue> Does that not confuse you?!
[12:11:23] <jakesy> satellites in orbit have to adjust their clocks for time dilation
[12:11:26] <jakesy> there is no sanity
[12:11:36] <surfdue> WHAT?!
[12:11:44] <BillCriswell> notchris: What the hell do you need altitude for anyway?
[12:12:03] <surfdue> jakesy: Does time differ based on distance from the Earth?
[12:12:13] <jakesy> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Relativity
[12:12:30] <baako> beenn reading about e.preventDefault() but still cant get the useage
[12:12:35] <surfdue> BillCriswell: He is using Jquery to power his orbiting satellite to determine to apply throttle to maintain orbit ratio. Duh
[12:12:43] <pawn> How do I get at an iframe element's document form a jquery object?
[12:13:02] <notchris> BillCriswell: Our museum is 6 stories
[12:13:04] <surfdue> jakesy: I thought the US government just gave incorrect GPS to cause inconsistent results for civilian based systems.
[12:13:10] <notchris> And I want the guests to know what floor they are on
[12:13:13] <notchris> Because it can get confusing
[12:13:17] <surfdue> Beacons.
[12:13:41] <surfdue> notchris: P.S. If you use iPhone only, they have built in altitude sensors. ;)
[12:14:04] <jakesy> gps for floor? good lord
[12:14:17] <notchris> jakesy: OK, what’s a better method
[12:14:26] <notchris> That identifies the floor they are on
[12:14:39] <jakesy> put "YOU ARE ON FLOOR #" on the loudspeaker evey 15 seconds
[12:14:54] <surfdue> notchris: is this a web app or a native app?
[12:14:55] <notchris> OK, so what if one exhibit is directly above another on a different floor
[12:15:00] <notchris> Then what?
[12:15:12] <surfdue> I MUST KNOW.
[12:15:18] <notchris> surfdue: Web app
[12:15:50] <surfdue> What sort of web app has the accuracy to place yourself on floors?! Thats impossible. The best you're going to get is 50 feet. Which spans multiple floors.
[12:16:25] <notchris> Hmmmm
[12:16:26] <notchris> THINK
[12:16:28] <surfdue> Use beacon technology. You will need to build using a native app, potentially using PhoneGap so you can utilize jQuery.
[12:16:42] <notchris> I’m going to think of an alternative
[12:16:45] <apipkin> I’m trying to trigger a custom event from within a widget but I am not able to see it. Any thoughts? http://jsbin.com/welena/2/edit
[12:16:45] <jakesy> do beacons use bluetooth?
[12:16:56] <surfdue> jakesy: yes. so they would be compatible with most modern phones.
[12:17:21] <jakesy> I was gunna say, bluetooth might be an option
[12:17:33] <jakesy> alternatively, just put QR codes all over the place
[12:17:40] <notchris> Wait....
[12:17:45] <BillCriswell> notchris: This is one of those situations where a qr code would be awesome, sucks the default camera app doesn't have a built in reader for them.
[12:18:01] <BillCriswell> jakesy: Yes, that's what I was thinking. Having to have a qr code app just sucks
[12:18:04] <notchris> What if I find the elevation of the farthest / tallest corner
[12:18:10] <notchris> And compare floors based on distance
[12:18:20] <jakesy> I dont think you'll get the accuracy you want
[12:18:23] <notchris> True
[12:18:25] <jakesy> precision*
[12:19:18] <BillCriswell> I'm curious to see how precise it is.
[12:20:03] <jakesy> http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/
[12:20:19] <notchris> This is our building: https://sturbridgelibraryfriends.org/w/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/connecticut-science-center.jpg
[12:20:26] <BillCriswell> No mention of altitude.
[12:20:26] <notchris> You don’t think it’s accurate enough?
[12:20:37] <notchris> To distinguish those floors?
[12:20:48] <surfdue> You can't be that accurate. Most accurate is 50 ft and thats IF you have GPS connection or triangle location
[12:21:00] <surfdue> In a building, a 7 story building albeit, you won't.
[12:21:07] <notchris> Damn.
[12:21:41] <surfdue> That giant solid flap of concrete extending into the horizon, looks beautiful, but I guarantee causes service interference. ;)
[12:21:49] <surfdue> That's what my house looks like.
[12:21:52] <notchris> Haha
[12:21:59] <jakesy> plus, you got the difference of people holding their phones in their hands, pockets, wearing helmets, etc
[12:22:14] <surfdue> lol @ helments in the museum
[12:22:33] <notchris> OK so
[12:22:37] <BillCriswell> I wish QR codes were readable with the default iOS / Android camera app.
[12:22:39] <notchris> I ask the guest what floor they are on
[12:22:42] <surfdue> notchris: I think you would benefit greatly if you create a native app and place beacons.
[12:22:43] <notchris> Via a select menu
[12:22:50] <notchris> And do the geolocation per floor
[12:22:56] <notchris> Solution?
[12:23:05] <jakesy> you could try to make the app a guided tour
[12:23:18] <robertMeeting> ^ that'll be smarter.
[12:23:23] <baako> beenn reading about e.preventDefault() but still cant get the usage
[12:23:25] <surfdue> notchris: Potentially.. I say when they open the "map" you show a nice interior 3d looking layout that you can swipe up and down so they can easily select the level.
[12:23:32] <robertmaxrees> baako what do you need to know?
[12:23:42] <notchris> I’m not good enough to build a native app
[12:23:47] <notchris> Well, I guess I could learn React
[12:23:50] <baako> what is the usage robertmaxrees and when can you use it
[12:24:10] <jakesy> http://famo.us/ also
[12:24:19] <surfdue> Imagine a 3d looking 7 floors, floating on top of each other, with the location beacon dot. As they scroll up and down the location dot stays put showing their actual location as a blue dot.
[12:24:20] <robertmaxrees> you can use it on any event, and you use it when you want to prevent the default action of an event.  Think of cases like when you click a link.
[12:24:30] <surfdue> notchris: phonegap.. you can do it
[12:24:34] <robertmaxrees> preventDefault() would prevent you from going to that link.
[12:24:35] <jakesy> or type a letter into an input form
[12:24:45] <notchris> surfdue: That would be cool
[12:25:04] <NoiseEee> notchris: not in toronto are you
[12:25:25] <notchris> NoiseEee: Connecticut
[12:25:33] <BillCriswell> notchris: There's a third option you can pass to navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() that you can ask for a much closer accuracy.
[12:25:33] <notchris> Here are our current floormap system: http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/visit/floor-maps/
[12:25:57] <BillCriswell> notchris: { desiredAccuracy: N } and N would be the amount of meters.
[12:26:08] <baako> robertmaxrees: thanks
[12:26:22] <notchris> BillCriswell: I don’t know how to include that in the current script
[12:26:31] <surfdue> Each floor is of a unique shape almost.. God be with you.
[12:26:34] <jakesy> you may not have accurate position, but you can get orientation pretty easy
[12:26:43] <notchris> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/2BRH5T8s
[12:26:53] <BillCriswell> notchris: getCurrentPosition( allowed, notallowed, options )
[12:27:11] <notchris> ?
[12:27:13] <jakesy> man that looks like a fun project.
[12:27:59] <aias> because #jquery is one of the busiest web dev channels, may i ask: what is the safest way to browse untrusted websites. i should turn off my javascript, and what else ?
[12:28:17] <surfdue> What sites are you trying to browse??
[12:28:27] <jakesy> use a computer at the library
[12:28:31] <surfdue> If it's untrusted, you should just refrain from going.
[12:28:32] <robertmaxrees> lol "turn off javascript" - why are you on unsafe websites to begin with?
[12:28:45] <notchris> Do an icognito session in Chrome?
[12:28:52] <robertmaxrees> if you want the "safest" option, get a VM and browse using that instead.
[12:29:01] <surfdue> Lol @icognito. Don't use windows.
[12:29:25] <jakesy> then take a shower afterwards and delete your downloads folder
[12:29:26] <notchris> incognito*
[12:29:41] <surfdue> This website is untrusted, would you like to install Active-X? OK! We are automatically installing due to your lack of response in 0.01 seconds.
[12:29:55] <robertmaxrees> but we should go back to the original question - what's an example of an "untrusted website"?  why are you going to them to begin with?
[12:31:14] <jakesy> hypothetically, the pirate bay, which I dont think is https
[12:31:29] <jakesy> oh no it is
[12:31:34] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:31:47] <robertmaxrees> also, defining "untrusted" is a good question, too.
[12:32:20] <aias> there's alot of this on freenode. someone asks a question, and rather than being interested in the technicalities of the matter people are more interested in why the question is being asked. it's just not good for education
[12:32:38] <aias> it's decadent
[12:32:41] <aias> it's lazy
[12:33:02] <notchris> That’s subjective
[12:33:05] <jakesy> lolwut
[12:33:06] <robertmaxrees> it's an open-ended question with a lot of different answers depending on some specifics.
[12:33:13] <notchris> Perhaps the intent of the person will decide the advice we give them
[12:33:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm sorry that you seem to feel the way you do - we're trying to give you concise, relevant advice.
[12:33:38] <aias> by untusted, i mean i don't know who hosts it, what its purpose is, what kind of content or code it may spit at me.
[12:33:47] <jakesy> also addressing the motive of the question is more educational than just answering it
[12:33:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:34:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd spin up a linux VM and put chrome or something on it and use that.
[12:34:20] <notchris> aias: In example, instead of asking us WHY we ask people their intent, you made a generalization.
[12:34:42] <notchris> And in turn, made the wrong analysis of our motives
[12:34:44] <robertmaxrees> don't log into any accounts or anything with it, just use it for your untrusted activities.
[12:35:14] <jakesy> yeah don't have any browser saved logins and disable JS and I don't think they could do anything really
[12:35:15] <aias> motiveception
[12:35:27] <notchris> Like in example, I wanted to know how to get Coordinates using Gmaps, a jquery plugin
[12:35:34] <notchris> @BillCriswell Asked me why I wanted to do that
[12:35:41] <notchris> After I explained, he actually suggested a better method
[12:35:56] <BillCriswell> notchris: altitude accuracy for my iphone is 10.. so 30feet seems about the limit?
[12:35:56] <spudzee1111> http://jsfiddle.net/r1vq5h00/
[12:35:59] <aias> different motives may spawn the same question. and different questions may be spawned by the same motives.
[12:36:14] <robertmaxrees> aias exactly why clarification is so helpful :)
[12:36:15] <spudzee1111> How do I make it where when I hover over the blue button, the shadow will smoothly fade in
[12:36:18] <spudzee1111> ?
[12:36:22] <jakesy> I do suppose the ceilings in a meuseum are pretty damned tall though
[12:36:24] <notchris> aias: There keyword there is “may”, and since there is no positive, we ask BG info.
[12:36:27] <BillCriswell> spudzee1111: css transitions
[12:36:39] <jakesy> i cant spell oh god
[12:36:47] <spudzee1111> well let me just head over to #css then
[12:36:50] <spudzee1111> later
[12:37:02] <jakesy> !mdn keyframes
[12:37:02] <b-ot> jakesy: @keyframes - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes
[12:37:09] <robertmaxrees> lol could help with that here, too, if you anted.
[12:37:13] <robertmaxrees> *wanted
[12:37:48] <aias> will routing via a proxy help defend against any web-exploits? like sites trying to access LAN?
[12:38:06] <robertmaxrees> not particularly.  use a locked down VM instead.  that
[12:38:11] <robertmaxrees> *that'll take care of everything.
[12:38:15] <aias> or is this generally not exploitable with javascript turned off etc
[12:38:41] <aias> i'll definitly be in a VM with all host to guest interaction minimized
[12:38:50] <robertmaxrees> then you're golden.
[12:39:01] <robertmaxrees> everything will be localized to the VM and you're pretty much safe.
[12:39:26] <aias> i guess i could even sandbox the browser in the vm, taking the idea further
[12:39:57] <robertmaxrees> sure.  get a good firewall and you're set.
[12:40:05] <BillCriswell> These options to getCurrentPosition don't seem to work very well.
[12:40:26] <aias> robertmaxrees: excellent point. firewall to deny all traffic except on port 80 and 443
[12:40:38] <aias> ingoing and out of the VMs OS
[12:41:16] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you can do all of that, but tbqh i really don't think it's that big of a concern otherwise.
[12:41:21] <BillCriswell> notchris: http://jsbin.com/vusagi/5/edit?js,output here is what I've been messing with if you're curious.
[12:41:26] <notchris> Thank you!
[12:41:30] <notchris> Also, our floors are 20ft
[12:41:31] <notchris> :/
[12:41:47] <BillCriswell> Er: http://jsbin.com/vusagi/5/edit?js,output
[12:42:22] <notchris> Altitude: null
[12:42:23] <notchris> Hmmm
[12:42:37] <BillCriswell> Sounds like you'd just want to tell them they're down a floor from where you calculate.
[12:42:47] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/vusagi/5/ go here on your phone.
[12:43:53] <notchris> Hmm
[12:44:00] <notchris> So right now I’m 16 meters above ground
[12:44:09] <notchris> So 48 feet above ground
[12:44:56] <BillCriswell> You might be able to get kind of close.
[12:45:01] <notchris> Yeah!
[12:45:03] <notchris> This could work...
[12:45:09] <notchris> I’m going to go up one floor
[12:45:12] <notchris> And see what it says
[12:45:14] <BillCriswell> Haha, have fun.
[12:45:14] <notchris> BRB
[12:45:29] <BobFrankly> is there a jquery "this" selector, something that targets the node that the script is within?
[12:45:43] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly the script, or the event listener?
[12:45:55] <BobFrankly> the script code
[12:46:04] <robertmaxrees> nope, because the script doesn't really have knowledge of where it is in the document.
[12:46:09] <BobFrankly> crap
[12:46:15] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't inline code anyway.
[12:46:25] <BobFrankly> it's a user macro in confluence
[12:46:38] <robertmaxrees> have an example?
[12:46:40] <BobFrankly> it's kinda weird and I'm trying to hackney something together
[12:46:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm kindasorta familiar with confluence
[12:46:59] <BobFrankly> it's not public facing
[12:47:01] <BobFrankly> but...
[12:47:10] <robertmaxrees> just the code.
[12:47:13] <BobFrankly> garcol.blogspot.com
[12:47:13] <robertmaxrees> or an example.
[12:47:50] <BobFrankly> what I'm trying to do is set a unique ID for each render of the macro
[12:48:12] <robertmaxrees> there are a few on that page - which one?
[12:48:12] <BobFrankly> so if the same value is placed twice in a page, it doesn't doubleup the appending
[12:48:20] <BobFrankly> robert, top one
[12:48:51] <BobFrankly> http://garcol.blogspot.com/2015/01/confluence-user-macro-using-rest.html   <---more exact link
[12:49:20] <BillCriswell> notchris: I think even a short code to enter into the app would be useful.
[12:49:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the script tag doesn't really have context of where it's located on the page.  there are super hacky tricks to maybe figure it out, but i'd avoid them if possible and see if you can't find a different way to do this.
[12:49:43] <BobFrankly> works well if there's only one reference to the same ticket, but more then one and each entry draws x more
[12:50:29] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: there are other ways, but I'm not super hot on learning Java
[12:51:06] <robertmaxrees> something about this seems funky.
[12:51:15] <BobFrankly> of course, I wrote it :D
[12:51:17] <robertmaxrees> what's with the "each entry draws x more" bit?
[12:51:49] <BobFrankly> because it targets on the $paramTicket, which is the ticket number typed into the macro
[12:52:30] <BobFrankly> so if you have 2 macros targeting the same ticket, each draw of the macro makes two calls, which target all of the class with that ticket number
[12:52:54] <BobFrankly> if you have 3, you get 3 hits, and three macros drawing to each instance
[12:53:35] <robertmaxrees> is it possible to know which $(".whdTicket_$paramTicket") you need to edit?
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> *append do.
[12:54:02] <robertmaxrees> *to - jeeze i can't type.  looks like you just need to target your appends a little different.
[12:54:21] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: yeah, thats what I want to do
[12:54:54] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: trying to figure out how to add a unique ID to each entry
[12:55:38] <BobFrankly> wanted to add a random number to $("this")
[12:55:53] <BobFrankly> and use that for targeting.
[12:55:57] <robertmaxrees> $(this) isn't what you want it to be in this case.
[12:56:19] <robertmaxrees> looks like you could use urlb wherever you need a unique ID, yeah?
[12:56:39] <BobFrankly> nope
[12:56:58] <BobFrankly> if there are two macros with the same ticket number on the same page, that's where I hit the error
[12:57:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd really do this in the java side then.  you could go through the page and try adding IDs to things, but that's kinda hacky.
[12:58:02] <BobFrankly> sadly, thats where I tend to end up :/
[12:58:18] <BobFrankly> thanks for looking at it though
[12:58:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah, sorry i couldn't be more help.
[13:00:52] <cardguy1000> Say am iterating some tr elements using .each(function(){... and inside that each block I'd like to select a class within that tr element.  For example $(this).('.myselector') can anyone point me in the right direction
[13:01:11] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find()
[13:01:18] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('.myclass')
[13:01:37] <apipkin> Is there a notion of `before` with custom events in a Widget?
[13:01:42] <cardguy1000> thanks robertmaxrees I will try this out and look at the docs.  I appreciate it
[13:02:11] <robertmaxrees> apipkin nope.  only the handler.
[13:03:10] <apipkin> If I _trigger(‘beforeShow’) and _on({beforeShow: function(){ }) The “before” event never gets captured
[13:03:33] <robertmaxrees> are you triggering before the event is bound?
[13:04:14] <apipkin> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/welena/4/edit
[13:04:14] <robertmaxrees> or is the thing you bound the listener to getting remove/added after pageload/etc?
[13:05:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/cazecutula/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[13:06:38] <apipkin> robertmaxrees: it was the capital letter??
[13:07:04] <robertmaxrees> i'd read through http://api.jquery.com/on/, but that seems funky - what's with the prepended underscores on method names?
[13:09:07] <BobFrankly> is it possible to do a jquery selector for all of a class that has no ID?
[13:09:15] <apipkin> OOoooo robertmaxrees looks like it’s converting it to lower “for me” https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widget.js#L498
[13:09:31] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly sure.
[13:09:53] <robertmaxrees> check out .filter()
[13:10:12] <BobFrankly> thanks
[13:10:25] <BobFrankly> see if I can't break confluence
[13:10:33] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:11:54] <apipkin> I can trigger “beforeShow” and it will still call _on({ beforeshow: fn })… that sounds wonky
[13:13:42] <robertmaxrees> are you sure using : is valid for namespacing?
[13:14:08] <_d4rklit3> hello
[13:14:20] <_d4rklit3> for some reason (window).on('mouseout' ... ) isn't working on windows but is on mac
[13:15:19] <BobFrankly> ooo: :not([id])
[13:15:41] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly use filter() and prop() instead if you can
[13:16:14] <BobFrankly> reasoning?
[13:16:19] * BobFrankly likes ot understand
[13:16:35] <apipkin> robertmaxrees: That came from a nettuts http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/making-use-of-jquery-uis-widget-factory--net-29606#highlighter_248463
[13:16:48] <robertmaxrees> :not() can (is?) slow.
[13:16:55] <BobFrankly> gotcha
[13:17:34] <robertmaxrees> you can also use .not()
[13:17:44] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/not/
[13:18:44] <apipkin> I’m looking through the source now to see if it’s been toLowerCase since the inception
[13:19:20] <BobFrankly> so .not("id ") would be proper syntax?
[13:19:31] <BobFrankly> minus the errant space
[13:19:47] <robertmaxrees> .not('#theId')
[13:20:15] <BobFrankly> I want to filter on the ABSENCE of an ID tag
[13:20:43] <BobFrankly> as in, of the element has an ID tag, I want to drop it off my list
[13:20:49] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, .filter() is what you want.
[13:20:54] <BobFrankly> ok
[13:22:38] <surfdue> notchris: what was your solution
[13:24:36] <apipkin> *sigh* It’s been in there since day one and apparently was even part of jquery's plugin code. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blame/1.8a2/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L164
[13:25:02] <robertmaxrees> apipkin i'm not seeing where the docs say to use : for namespacing
[13:30:30] <apipkin> robertmaxrees: it doesn’t say you have to, but it doesn’t say you can’t? I wasn’t getting an issue with the `:` I was getting  an issue with [A-Z]
[13:31:18] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/namespaced-events-jquery/
[13:31:33] <robertmaxrees> you're supposed to use periods, not colons.
[13:31:37] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if that plays into the problem.
[13:35:37] <apipkin> No. I even put `+` and that worked. It’s nothing other than the `toLowerCase()` being applied to the event name within the _trigger logic
[13:35:48] <SwellJoe> I need to make an AJAX request of a somewhat long running process and have the incoming HTML displayed as it comes in (as it would if it were simply an html page being loaded by the browser). How can I do that? (jQuery .load and various other AJAX requests only display on complete.)
[13:36:16] <apipkin> If you do `_trigger(‘beforeShow’)` it’s actually firing the event `beforeshow`
[13:36:40] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting the underscored method nameds from?
[13:37:25] <apipkin> robertmaxrees: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#jQuery-Widget2
[13:37:39] <apipkin> It’s a Widget, not a plugin
[13:37:39] <robertmaxrees> aaaah using the widget factory in JQUI
[13:38:38] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[13:38:45] <robertmaxrees> sorry i missed that!
[13:39:37] <apipkin> And jquery `trigger` doesn’t do that apparently, only the widget
[13:40:03] <notchris> surfdue: OK SO
[13:40:06] <notchris> Here’s the solution
[13:40:10] <robertmaxrees> maybe check to see if there's a bug and report one?
[13:40:31] <notchris> At an estimated avg of 65% accuracy...
[13:40:42] <notchris> I will still be 3 meters off in calculation
[13:40:48] <notchris> No matter where I calculate elevation
[13:41:11] <notchris> So, there’s no really good way to measure such a close range with the google elevation api
[13:41:13] <notchris> HOWEVER
[13:41:22] <notchris> The long / lat calculationd are extremely accurate
[13:41:27] <apipkin> robertmaxrees: do you know where issues are tracked? I didn’t see them in github
[13:41:35] <surfdue> yes, so you just need the floor.
[13:41:42] <surfdue> too bad you cant access the devices alt chips :P
[13:41:47] <notchris> SO, I could associate a floor per exhibit
[13:41:57] <notchris> And based on the exhibit you’re currently at, it will say the floor
[13:42:04] <notchris> Sadly, it wont work if they are not an exhibit
[13:42:07] <notchris> SO that wont work.
[13:42:08] <surfdue> how will it know what exhibit your at?
[13:42:32] <Duvdevan> pozdrav svoj Srbadiji ovdje!
[13:42:33] <notchris> surfdue: Because the distance between exhibits is larger than the available accuracy
[13:42:36] <notchris> Which is good.
[13:42:48] <notchris> So here’s my solution
[13:42:57] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery ui bugs
[13:42:58] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: jQuery UI → http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[13:43:06] <notchris> I can measure the base of the building, which is 14 meters above sea level
[13:43:17] <notchris> Then, I can mesaure the distance to the top floor
[13:43:34] <notchris> Knowing that range, I can create an average elevation range per floor
[13:43:48] <notchris> And that will get me within 3 meters of accuracy
[13:44:02] <notchris> Which is 11 ft below each max floor height
[13:45:08] <BillCriswell> Sounds mathy.
[13:45:16] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell++
[13:45:23] <notchris> It sucks
[13:45:28] <notchris> I like the beacon idea better
[13:45:32] <surfdue> Lol
[13:45:34] <surfdue> youre crazy.
[13:45:43] <surfdue> It will never work
[13:45:46] <surfdue> what if someone has tmobile?
[13:45:49] <surfdue> they just cant use the app :P
[13:45:55] <notchris> They said that about planes
[13:45:58] <notchris> And cloning
[13:46:12] <BillCriswell> A QR code or a short code to enter would be my approach propbably.
[13:46:18] <BillCriswell> probably
[13:46:21] <BillCriswell> pro bab ly
[13:46:33] <robertmaxrees> brobrably?
[13:46:46] <BillCriswell> bro bra ly
[13:46:51] <robertmaxrees> siiiick
[13:47:02] <notchris> WAIT
[13:47:04] <Duvdevan> shoky brotha
[13:47:06] <notchris> There is a router on each floor
[13:47:14] <notchris> That could help me right?
[13:47:53] <BillCriswell> How would you identify which router they're connected to? Can't the router connect between floors?
[13:48:17] <notchris> There’s one in each gallery
[13:48:25] <notchris> So I could somehow….have it find the closest one?
[13:50:06] <NoiseEee> speaking from interactive exhibits i've been to, its been common for the user to 'orient' the app by either scanning a type of code or  particular image
[13:50:29] <shoky> oi Duvdevan
[13:50:43] <notchris> NoiseEee: Yeah I’m just going to do that
[13:50:52] <notchris> Alright guys, I give up, I’m going to go the logical route
[13:52:11] <notchris> Also, here’s the distance from a router formula
[13:52:12] <notchris> distance = 10 ^ ((27.55 - (20 * log10(frequency)) + signalLevel)/20)
[13:53:49] <BillCriswell> notchris: How would that help you in JS though?
[14:16:46] <_DB> im having the weirdest error on my page right now
[14:16:52] <_DB> have no idea why its happening
[14:17:04] <_DB> well I know why but but dont understand why
[14:17:36] <robertmaxrees> shoot
[14:19:06] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/vfkag5mp/
[14:19:15] <_DB> I have 2 inputs on the same page
[14:19:24] <_DB> they do the same thing and use the same ajax request
[14:19:27] <_DB> but have different ids
[14:19:38] <_DB> (it works exactly the same way on another page)
[14:19:59] * Velveeta rips some wires out of something and says "i found your problem right here... there's no javascript in this example!"
[14:20:10] <_DB> but the problem is on this page I got this error Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[14:20:28] <robertmaxrees> great - show us the code :)
[14:20:55] <robertmaxrees> because what you've given us is totally unhelpful.
[14:21:39] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/vfkag5mp/1/
[14:22:03] <Velveeta> so which line of that is throwing the error you're getting?
[14:22:22] <pawn> When an iframe isn't finished loading and a user presses the Esc key or the stop browser button, the onload event wont trigger. What even will?
[14:22:30] <_DB> a external script is
[14:22:31] <_DB> lol
[14:22:37] <_DB> which is why its weird
[14:22:52] <Velveeta> jackiechanwtf.png
[14:23:05] <_DB> im getting a javscript error from a  external page because of the html (and it works using the same code on another page)
[14:23:27] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:23:32] <robertmaxrees> so this code won't help us.
[14:23:35] <robertmaxrees> live example, i guess?
[14:23:39] <Velveeta> an external page as in a surrounding page and this is in an iframe? or when you say external page, do you mean the external script?
[14:23:47] <Velveeta> yeah, a live example would be beautiful
[14:23:53] <_DB> yeah external script
[14:24:00] <robertmaxrees> this is one of those few cases where a live example would be nice.
[14:24:02] <_DB> this is using the google api for maps
[14:24:19] <_DB> (i dont have a live example) -_-
[14:24:40] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:24:47] <robertmaxrees> so where are you seeing the error?
[14:24:48] <_DB> im working off local (but I cant upload to my site either since its work related an I signed a NDA)
[14:25:16] <Velveeta> so, you can't show us the code in question, or tell us what line it's crapping out on, and showed us a bunch of unrelated markup and javascript
[14:25:31] <_DB> Well thats all the code I have
[14:25:40] <_DB> to it, everything else is external scripts
[14:25:57] <robertmaxrees> so how are we supposed to help?
[14:25:59] <Velveeta> can you use the call stack to track that error you're getting back to a line of your own code that's kicking off that execution path?
[14:26:36] <_DB> https://maps.gstatic.com/maps-api-v3/api/js/19/9/main.js
[14:26:46] <_DB> that file sis giving me the error on line 58 and 59
[14:26:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not helpful without seeing everything you've got in action.
[14:27:06] <_DB> ok should I include the links to the scripts?
[14:27:08] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[14:27:12] <_DB> on the jsfiddle?
[14:27:19] <robertmaxrees> you should replicate the error in the fiddle.
[14:29:44] <Velveeta> do you know how to look through a call stack?
[14:29:58] <Velveeta> because if you can find a spot that relates back to your own code, that might help us some
[14:31:24] <baloney> hi, i invoked a restful api and received the following json => http://pastebin.com/cd4JPj5v using the following code => http://jsbin.com/yilidaleni/1/edit?html,js,output  => I can obtain the value of "Resource" but not "Region" or "MaterialType"; what may be the prob?
[14:31:49] <Velveeta> how are you trying to reference the region and materialtype properties?
[14:32:02] <_DB> alright I just have one more file I need to link to it
[14:32:11] <_DB> but its a local file how Can i add it to the jsfiddle
[14:32:27] <Velveeta> nevermind, i should have checked the other link :D
[14:32:57] <Velveeta> _db: you can't link to it for us to see, you'd have to inline it in the fiddle
[14:33:33] <robertmaxrees> baloney sure can.
[14:33:57] <robertmaxrees> baloney is the data you linked what's in data.d.results?
[14:34:37] <Velveeta> baloney: try something like this: object.Region.results[0].Value
[14:34:58] <robertmaxrees> also, don't use for...in on arrays
[14:35:19] <Velveeta> Region doesn't have any direct member named Value, so you're referencing that path incorrectly
[14:35:57] <Velveeta> and yeah, good call, it'll enumerate it as an object instead of an array, and you'll get other properties that aren't meant for typical array iteration
[14:36:17] <robertmaxrees> use $.each(), .forEach(), _.each(), or a normal iterator....
[14:36:44] <Velveeta> i use for (var i = 0, j = myArr.length; i < j; i++) :D
[14:37:11] <robertmaxrees> i use .forEach() when I can or _.each() when i don't have ES5 guaranteed.
[14:37:14] <jim_j> hi
[14:37:48] <Velveeta> hullo
[14:38:34] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/vfkag5mp/6/
[14:38:40] <_DB> I figured it wouldnt give the same error
[14:38:43] <_DB> to many things to laod
[14:39:08] <jim_j> I'm getting reports that my jquery call:  jQuery('.single-content > p:nth-child('+repeat_every_val + 'n+' + (inlinead_pos_val)+')'); doesn't work in IE 11.  is anyone aware of an issue with the call and IE11?
[14:39:55] <Velveeta> it would help to see what all those variables resolved to so we could see the actual selector string
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[14:40:10] <Velveeta> but i don't know of any reason offhand why a selector wouldn't work specifically with just IE11
[14:40:30] <baloney> Velveeta: you're a life saver! thanks
[14:40:41] <baloney> why did i need the results there like that
[14:40:44] <Velveeta> woo hoo!
[14:40:55] <baloney> been busting my head for the last 30 minutes
[14:40:56] <Velveeta> because results is the subkey in that json response
[14:41:10] <Velveeta> i don't know if you were asking me that question or voicing frustration at having included that there
[14:41:27] <baloney> asking :)
[14:41:32] <baloney> sorry for missing the ?
[14:41:55] <TrentonDAdams> Anyone know why this doesn't work?  The API docs for datepicker claim that it has a getDate() method. http://jsfiddle.net/vse6xj64/6/
[14:42:22] <baloney> i tried object.Region.results.Value before with no success, didn't think it requires the index since there was only one result in there
[14:43:13] <robertmaxrees> TrentonDAdams your code is malformed
[14:43:28] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm.
[14:43:29] <robertmaxrees> ignore me!
[14:44:39] <Velveeta> baloney: yep, arrays always require an index
[14:45:05] <jim_j> velveeta, is there a way to test the selector in IE11 if I'm on a mac?
[14:45:17] <robertmaxrees> TrentonDAdams probably because you need to init it first?
[14:45:24] <robertmaxrees> and then set the beforeShow()?
[14:45:33] <Velveeta> jim_j: not without firing up a VM
[14:45:39] <robertmaxrees> https://www.modern.ie/en-us ftw
[14:45:51] <Velveeta> (y)
[14:46:05] <Velveeta> irc needs support for skype emoticons
[14:46:22] <jim_j> velveeta, like Microsoft Azure?
[14:48:35] <Velveeta> nope, i think azure is for windows mobile development isn't it?
[14:48:54] <robertmaxrees> it's their cloud compute platform
[14:48:58] <Velveeta> i mean fire up an actual windows VM through VMWare or VirtualBox and run a windows machine on your Mac, and then use that VM to test IE11 problems
[14:49:08] <robertmaxrees> he's talking about this: http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/
[14:49:18] <Velveeta> oh ok, then i suppose that might work if they have cloud-hosted public VM's
[14:49:29] <jim_j> maybe that's overkill?
[14:49:41] <robertmaxrees> jim_j then use a VM.
[14:49:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:49:48] <jim_j> cool, thanks :)
[14:51:15] <Velveeta> i believe virtualbox is a free download, and modern.ie hosts both vmware and virtualbox images for free download
[14:51:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:51:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm on windows and use 'em.
[14:51:36] <Velveeta> i use their vmware images myself from a mac
[14:51:51] <Velveeta> not often, because i got spoiled on osx and hate launching windows unless i have to :D
[14:52:09] <robertmaxrees> i actually CHOOSE to use windows.
[14:52:13] <jim_j> haha
[14:52:21] <Velveeta> when i first started here, i fought having to be issued a mac
[14:52:42] <robertmaxrees> errybody loves to hate on me in the office until they remember i'm the only one running the OS most of our endusers are on.
[14:53:12] <Velveeta> all of our front end engineers had to have macs, under the guise that that's what our adobe licenses were under or something, because our designers used macs.. i've come to enjoy its performance, but still vowed that when i got my new one, i'd go with a windows machine
[14:53:18] <baloney> robertmaxrees: there's no choice! in the corp world, least my place, we have to use IE since everything is so integrated with it
[14:53:32] <robertmaxrees> baloney we're corporate and get a choice :)
[14:53:47] <Velveeta> when that time actually came, i rationalized keeping a mac by saying well i have to test mac browsers, and while i can run windows in a VM on a mac, the apple eula doesn't let me run OSX in a VM from a windows machine sooooooo
[14:54:01] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> that's fair.
[14:54:19] <Velveeta> and with 16 gigs, it's not bad at all, even when i have to run a VM
[14:54:32] <Velveeta> oh, and an SSD
[14:54:36] <Velveeta> that makes it really nice
[14:54:37] <robertmaxrees> 16 gigs and SSDs for lyfe
[14:54:45] <baloney> robertmaxrees: lucky you!
[14:54:56] <robertmaxrees> baloney we're the special snowflake of our parent company.
[14:55:01] <Velveeta> do you work at an undisclosed location also robert?
[14:55:04] <baloney> only ppl i know that gets a choice are my friends that work in media companies
[14:55:05] <robertmaxrees> Build.com
[14:55:10] <robertmaxrees> ain't ashamed of it.
[14:55:12] <Velveeta> i don't think i've ever even heard of that
[14:55:22] <robertmaxrees> we're looking to change that this year ;)
[14:55:26] <robertmaxrees> national TV ad campaigns.
[14:55:26] <Velveeta> nice
[14:55:37] <robertmaxrees> we directly compete with Lowes and Home Depot's online divisions.
[14:55:43] <baloney> ah nice robertmaxrees, what do you do?
[14:55:44] <Velveeta> is this contractor lead generation, or an actual service company?
[14:55:52] <robertmaxrees> home improvement good.
[14:55:55] <Velveeta> oh ok, gotcha
[14:55:56] <robertmaxrees> baloney software developer.
[14:56:16] <baloney> awesome, what is their stack?
[14:56:24] <robertmaxrees> you'll laugh
[14:56:28] <Velveeta> oh boy :D
[14:56:35] <Velveeta> visual foxpro!
[14:56:51] <robertmaxrees> i actually like our backend - Java w/ spring.  mobile platform is Node.
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> we're starting work with Play
[14:57:13] <robertmaxrees> our main frontends are all coldfusion, though.
[14:57:31] <Velveeta> we have such a hodgepodge of technologies in play where i'm at, part of our next year is supposed to be dedicated to trying to pare down that diversity
[14:57:32] <robertmaxrees> we also have 7 niche sites aside from our main one.
[14:57:37] <Velveeta> coldfusion, yowza
[14:57:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:58:06] <robertmaxrees> oddly enough, it actually works pretty well for us when we moved all our business logic to our backend.
[14:58:16] <Velveeta> our front end engineers here have had an amazing impact on technology decisions here though, despite being outnumbered by the backend devs something like 5+ to 1
[14:58:19] <jakesy> my effective tax rate is 6.82%
[14:58:26] <Velveeta> we're getting more and more node integration all the time
[14:58:47] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[14:59:11] <Velveeta> one of our more senior backend guys was talking w/ me earlier about just that, and said one bonus is that all of your devs at that point are full stack devs
[14:59:19] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[14:59:32] <Velveeta> if you go with any other language, it won't run in the browser, so you automatically have need of javascript people plus whatever that back end language is
[14:59:42] <robertmaxrees> we've had to do a lot of education here w/r/t javascript
[15:00:14] <Velveeta> we've had to do a lot of refactoring here in that regard, we had years worth of js front ends that were written by back end devs, most c# devs, that didn't quite understand how a front end should be organized
[15:00:26] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[15:00:28] <Velveeta> plus they had back end code generating front end functions, it was a mess
[15:00:32] <robertmaxrees> lots of psuedoclassical code?
[15:00:45] <robertmaxrees> oh...  oh no...
[15:00:54] <Velveeta> yepyep, and very global-functionally organized
[15:01:16] <robertmaxrees> yuck
[15:01:21] <Velveeta> we've managed to whip most of the products into a fairly modern semblance of code organization at this point
[15:01:38] <robertmaxrees> we're going through a similar pattern right now.
[15:02:52] <Velveeta> and what i said about the technology divergence eeked its way into the front end also, we've run all of these products as individual startups for so long, we now have backbone on some, angular on others, jquery spaghetti on others, marionette on one, and we used to have a knockout and an ember app that have each gone by the wayside
[15:03:35] <Velveeta> we're gonna try to compress that down to a single prescribed framework in the near future, at least for ongoing development.. we won't necessarily go back and retrofit legacy code, but we don't want N different dev stacks in the company
[15:04:05] <robertmaxrees> hah - we're doing that right now
[15:04:05] <Velveeta> it makes moving developer assets around a pain in the ass, with individual ramp up time everytime someone switches teams, and no modules that can easily be shared across products
[15:04:26] <robertmaxrees> we just decided on what our common frontend libraries and plugins and frameworks will be.
[15:04:37] <Velveeta> we're having those discussions right now
[15:05:03] <Velveeta> and we're still handcuffed to IE8+ for our support matrix, which knocks some things like ampersand and polymer out of the running
[15:05:11] <robertmaxrees> i stopped caring so much WHAT we chose and focused more on making SURE we chose.
[15:05:17] <robertmaxrees> yep - we're the same way, too.
[15:05:51] <Velveeta> yeah, that's where we're at, no prior opinionation (we like to rip on angular a lot), just bring your selections to the table and we'll hash them out based on their merit
[15:06:10] <Velveeta> and i'm less interested in prescribing the technology choice so much as the implementation methodologies anyway
[15:06:15] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[15:06:36] <Velveeta> any framework can be used to perform MVC, MVVM, whatever you need, with the right modules bolted onto it, or the right patterns being employed
[15:06:57] <Velveeta> so choosing angular just because it offers MVVM isn't the right reason, you can get observable object support in backbone if you want it
[15:07:25] <Velveeta> not to mention that anybody starting an angular app today is just asking for a rewrite in a year when 2 is out there
[15:07:37] <robertmaxrees> i think people get a little too caught up in those discussions sometimes.  i mean, i have really strong opinions on some of that, but ultimately it's all about the various tradeoffs anyway
[15:08:30] <Velveeta> right, we need to pick the best long-term strategy that's gonna be flexible enough for individual product needs, fast enough for rapid prototyping, and performant enough to also allow for mobile development
[15:08:39] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[15:08:57] <Velveeta> so API stability, size of community, all that jazz
[15:09:01] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:09:38] <Velveeta> ok, i gotta get outta here now, rush hour is in full swing and it'll take me 45 minutes to get home at this point :D
[15:09:48] <robertmaxrees> ouch!  good luck.
[15:09:51] <Velveeta> adios!
[15:11:39] <jakesy> 45 minutes? not bad
[15:13:37] <robertmaxrees> my commute is at most 15 minutes.
[15:13:50] <jakesy> :c
[15:13:58] <jakesy> mines 45 minutes.. but it used to be 2.5 hours
[15:14:02] <robertmaxrees> eff that
[15:14:26] <jakesy> as an undergrad, during the summer, I was excited to do it
[15:14:29] <jakesy> it was by lightrail
[15:14:44] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[15:15:07] <jakesy> 45 minutes by car, 40 miles
[15:15:25] <jakesy> yknow, if I left at 3am and returned at 2pm
[15:16:11] <robertmaxrees> jeesh
[15:17:07] <jakesy> worth it though. at the time I barely knew what bash was and they plopped an 8 node hadoop cluster in my lap
[15:24:09] <scrandaddy> hey there. is it possible for jquery to return elements for a selector before the document is ready? or at least before children can be appended to them?
[15:24:23] <robertmaxrees> it's possible, sure.
[15:24:28] <robertmaxrees> desirable is another question.
[15:25:07] <scrandaddy> it's not desirable, i'm trying to fix a bug :)
[15:25:18] <robertmaxrees> ah! is the code in a document ready?
[15:25:24] <scrandaddy> nope!
[15:25:28] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[15:25:37] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[15:25:47] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: figured out a workaround, just made another param in the user macro, and directions to change it for multiples of the same. Unique ID comes from that
[15:25:52] <scrandaddy> so even though the document is not ready i am still getting results back from a selector query?
[15:25:58] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly hah, there you go.
[15:26:13] <BobFrankly> tried too hard to make it too smart
[15:26:14] <robertmaxrees> scrandaddy race conditions - you're getting whatever is ready by the time your code executes.
[15:26:16] <BobFrankly> gave up :D
[15:26:30] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: excellent, thanks!
[15:26:43] <robertmaxrees> hah, giving up usually helps in my experience.
[15:26:54] <BobFrankly> lol
[15:27:18] <BobFrankly> sometimes it's the giving up and taking a damn lunch that helps too
[15:27:29] <robertmaxrees> ah yesssss.
[15:30:08] <andrew9183> weird, i’m having a successful ajax call return through the error handler, what could be wrong?
[15:30:18] <robertmaxrees> invalid data.
[15:30:26] <andrew9183> invalid response data?
[15:30:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:33:46] <andrew9183> ah exactly right, wasn’t returning valid json
[15:33:53] <robertmaxrees> :D
[15:41:50] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees, Sorry, I was in a meeting.  You said my code was malformed.  Did you mean not having a jQuery ready handler?
[15:42:00] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees, Oh, my newest one is http://jsfiddle.net/vse6xj64/9/
[15:42:27] <robertmaxrees> i was mistaken - your real problem is you're trying to call that function before the object has it
[15:44:40] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees, How can it *not* have it?  It's the instance of the datepicker, no?
[15:44:54] <robertmaxrees> the datepicker hasn't fully initialized yet.
[15:45:30] <TrentonDAdams> Oh, no date picked, duh
[15:45:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:45:42] <robertmaxrees> well, not necessarily.
[15:45:54] <TrentonDAdams> But shouldn't it at least return something, rather than being undefined?
[15:46:06] <robertmaxrees> the object doesn't have it yet...
[15:46:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure how else to phrase that.
[15:46:22] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees, Is this mentioned somewhere in the docs?
[15:46:48] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:47:25] <robertmaxrees> oh, hah i was wrong.
[15:48:08] <TrentonDAdams> Yeah, I just did a log of    instance.getDate === undefined ? null:instance.getDate()
[15:48:12] <TrentonDAdams> it always returns null
[15:48:15] <robertmaxrees> my bad - sorry, instance is the DOM node.
[15:48:20] <robertmaxrees> so you want http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vse6xj64/10/
[15:48:43] <robertmaxrees> though that's still broken.
[15:49:33] <ezio> i have a hidden panel.  google maps doesn't like that when i show the panel it has to be resized
[15:49:38] <ezio> any general advice?
[15:49:48] <ezio> well-known solution?
[15:50:03] <ezio> it's a bootstrap tab panel
[15:50:03] <TrentonDAdams> ezio, Dpm
[15:50:07] <TrentonDAdams> oh, lol
[15:50:15] <ezio> dpm?
[15:50:18] <TrentonDAdams> miss typed
[15:50:28] <BobFrankly> derps per minute?
[15:50:31] <TrentonDAdams> I was going to be a smart ass: Don't use google maps? :P
[15:50:50] <TrentonDAdams> ezio, Is that a browser issue I wonder?
[15:51:13] <ezio> TrentonDAdams, probably not
[15:51:32] <ezio> the issue looks to be caused by the fact that an invisible pane has no dimensions
[15:51:41] <robertmaxrees> TrentonDAdams http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vse6xj64/11/
[15:51:54] <TrentonDAdams> ezio, maybe auto resize using jQuery, after it is displayed?
[15:52:39] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees, shit, I completely forgot that you have to do it that way.  Been awhile apparently!  Thanks!
[15:52:48] <ezio> i tried to do that but i think my resize call isn't far enough down the chain
[15:52:48] <robertmaxrees> sorry it took me a second!
[15:52:59] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees, No biggie, help much appreciated.
[15:53:07] <robertmaxrees> ezio do you have a simple fiddle example?
[15:53:20] <ezio> umm
[15:53:38] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if you say "no" :)
[15:53:39] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees, he doesn't need fiddle, let's just keep guessing. :P
[15:53:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:53:54] <ezio> what i should do is add a vhost
[15:54:04] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees, is against having fun apparently. :D
[15:54:15] <robertmaxrees> nah, just not a magician ;)
[15:54:27] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees, or mind reader, right, gotcha
[16:30:44] <buzzlewoo> is there some kind of jq slider than will advance and image and some text, together. screengrab of the idea:  http://coffeeonmars.com/screenshots/jqslideridea.jpg
[16:31:00] <robertmaxrees> just about any carousel can do that.
[16:31:19] <robertmaxrees> though adding text into the mix highlights exactly why you should probably avoid carousels in the first place.
[16:31:22] <buzzlewoo> carousel?
[16:31:32] <buzzlewoo> carousels are problematic?
[16:31:37] <robertmaxrees> what you want is more appropriately termed a carousel, not a slider.
[16:31:51] <robertmaxrees> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[16:33:45] <buzzlewoo> but youre saying carousel's have isssues?
[16:34:02] <robertmaxrees> check out the link i just sent you.
[16:34:08] <robertmaxrees> it explains why you should avoid them.
[16:34:23] <buzzlewoo> is there another technology which does what I'm after better?
[16:34:39] <robertmaxrees> rethink your design and why you're trying to shove many things into one place.
[16:35:04] <robertmaxrees> if you really find that you must use a carousel, don't let it auto advance - make that something the user controls.
[16:38:32] <buzzlewoo> ah..it's a UX issue, not a code issue
[16:38:35] <buzzlewoo> I respect that
[16:38:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:39:25] <buzzlewoo> thank you, robertmaxrees
[16:39:39] <buzzlewoo> I personally never liked those things, but they seem to be a go-to for many situations
[16:39:52] <buzzlewoo> most of the "fancy crap" I really don't like
[16:39:57] <buzzlewoo> it feels very faddish
[16:40:15] <buzzlewoo> well I am glad I asked my question..
[16:40:22] <robertmaxrees> those situations are generally due to the fact that somebody said "i want to fit a bunch of stuff in one space"
[16:40:29] <buzzlewoo> ya
[16:40:41] <robertmaxrees> they think that everything in the carousel will then get attention - users actually ignore them now.
[16:40:59] <robertmaxrees> they're effectively blindspots.  when everything is a big blinky shiny thing, nothing stands out.
[16:41:00] <buzzlewoo> that is precisely what I do when I see those things
[16:41:06] <buzzlewoo> yeah
[16:43:41] <buzzlewoo> I know that everyone is still apey over all things interactive but as time goes on, more and more time-honored Print values come to be held up as "UX" principles for the web
[16:43:54] <robertmaxrees> hah, sort of.
[16:43:57] <buzzlewoo> like, who knew that human cognition would trump shiny blinky things
[16:44:06] <buzzlewoo> yeha, sort of..it's not an exact translation..
[16:44:06] <robertmaxrees> some of the core ideals sure, but just the core ones.
[16:44:18] <robertmaxrees> "above the fold" and all that are still poorly understood by the print world.
[16:44:35] <buzzlewoo> hmmm...how you mean?
[16:44:51] <robertmaxrees> users know how to scroll.
[16:44:59] <robertmaxrees> the print industry largely seems to think they don't.
[16:45:11] <buzzlewoo> I don't get you
[16:45:25] <buzzlewoo> you mean the print industry when they have a web presence?
[16:45:29] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:45:34] <buzzlewoo> ah
[16:45:35] <robertmaxrees> i used to work with newspapers.
[16:45:49] <buzzlewoo> well, for my own part, I would rather not scroll
[16:45:52] <robertmaxrees> they seemed to think that their old justifications for "above the fold" translated exactly.
[16:45:54] <buzzlewoo> even swiping isn't my fave
[16:46:11] <buzzlewoo> is there data on how people feel about scrolling/swiping?
[16:46:29] <robertmaxrees> "feeling" and "what they actually do" are two different things.
[16:46:30] <acidjazz> DATA
[16:46:36] <buzzlewoo> true dat
[16:47:07] <buzzlewoo> I misplaced my nielson/eyetracking book..been meaning to dive into that
[16:49:09] <buzzlewoo> what I actually do is scroll, but I don't like to. it's not like I'm picking up a bale of hay, it just seems like work
[16:49:24] <buzzlewoo> if I could do something else besides scroll, I'd want to try that something else
[17:01:41] <goddard> how can i get around this error ? Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated
[17:01:50] <robertmaxrees> are you using ajax?
[17:01:52] <goddard> can i disable this in my browser?
[17:01:54] <goddard> yes
[17:02:02] <robertmaxrees> do you have async: false; set?
[17:02:09] <goddard> not sure
[17:02:18] <robertmaxrees> that would cause it.
[17:04:46] <goddard> robertmaxrees would that be something I add to my headers?
[17:05:16] <robertmaxrees> that's something that you would've added to your ajax call.
[17:05:40] <goddard> robertmaxrees ahh ok
[17:05:42] <robertmaxrees> is the page publicly available?
[17:05:46] <goddard> no
[17:06:02] <robertmaxrees> okay
[17:10:22] <goddard> robertmaxrees its actually part of a cordova app
[17:11:17] <robertmaxrees> that doens't really change anything... you have an ajax call somewhere that's running sync
[17:11:46] <goddard> robertmaxrees gotcha i was just letting you know why it isn't public
[17:11:51] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[17:22:42] <checkit> Guys... I don't know why my brain is completely failing me today with JS... Can anyone tell me why this isn't triggering please? http://jsfiddle.net/jse3pwuw/
[17:23:04] <robertmaxrees> prevenDefault is misspelled.
[17:23:08] <robertmaxrees> open your console :)
[17:23:30] <checkit> SON OF A BITCH!
[17:23:39] <checkit> I had it open... Uncaught expception...
[17:23:44] <checkit> Couldn't trace it back...
[17:24:00] <robertmaxrees> this is why I like the FF dev tools - TypeError: e.prevenDefault is not a function
[17:25:59] <checkit> Oh. Good to know. I'll open that up next time before coming back here.
[17:32:24] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: as oppose to what? for erroring?
[17:33:18] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:34:04] <robertmaxrees> one of the reasons i prefer the ff dev tools over the chrome dev tools because the source of the error is often much more apparent.
[17:34:15] <robertmaxrees> for me at least.
[17:34:33] <pawn> How much is jquery supporting npm and browserify?
[17:35:31] <robertmaxrees> a normal amount?
[17:42:52] <robertmaxrees> pawn that's kind of a weird question :)
[17:56:57] <acidjazz> heres an intersting thing
[17:56:59] <acidjazz> if i do
[17:56:59] <acidjazz>     $('.form.form :input').each (i, el) ->
[17:57:04] <acidjazz> and i hit inputs
[17:57:14] <acidjazz> if i do $(el).attr 'type'
[17:57:16] <robertmaxrees> .form.form ?
[17:57:27] <acidjazz> everything i get is fine.. except textarea I get undefined
[17:57:34] <acidjazz> yea class name is form
[17:57:37] <acidjazz> oh yea shoudl be form.form
[17:57:48] <robertmaxrees> you generally want .prop()
[17:57:50] <robertmaxrees> for forms
[17:58:34] <acidjazz> so .prop('type') /
[17:58:36] <acidjazz> ?
[17:58:44] <robertmaxrees> also, textareas don't have a type do they?
[17:58:52] <robertmaxrees> oh input type="textarea"
[17:59:37] <robertmaxrees> or <textarea>
[17:59:49] <robertmaxrees> because obviously the latter doesn't have a type.
[18:08:33] <hellier> http://jsfiddle.net/v2qy7hqg/ - is there a better way to do this? That is, to add an object node using an if statement
[18:09:46] <robertmaxrees> "an object node"?
[18:10:56] <hellier> an element to the object, w/e they're called
[18:11:03] <robertmaxrees> ooooh
[18:11:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v2qy7hqg/1/
[18:11:42] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this instead.
[18:12:24] <robertmaxrees> you're adding a property to an object.
[18:13:05] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go home.  enjoy folks!
[19:02:44] <pawn> Browserify keeps jQuery from being global, so how can plugins install into a global jQuery object if there is none?
[19:14:15] <Velveeta> they can't, if they're written to access a global jquery object.. they'd have to be rewritten in commonjs format and require('jquery')
[21:29:50] <pawn> Velveeta: Is there any initiative to getting all plugins to support commonjs format as well as a global jquery object?
[21:30:48] <pawn> Could jquery plugins be installed by require-ing jquery?
[21:31:27] <pawn> I didn't know you could modify an exported object in a commonjs module.
[21:56:51] <systemfault> Yeah... but by design, the jQuery plugin system is really awful.
[22:00:47] <Chulbul> I'm using jquery.validate.js plugin for form validations, I have one concern with its remote method, where it accepts true or false and displays message accordingly. Is it possible for it read json like [true] or [false], is it possible or not asim using zf2 , there isn't any possible way to send simply true, it always send [true] or [false]?
[22:09:33] <Chulbul> Is there anyone who can suggest me something ?
[22:20:34] <kevireilly_> Chulbul: this one, correct? http://jqueryvalidation.org/remote-method
[22:21:03] <Chulbul> kevireilly_, yes
[22:22:08] <kevireilly_> Chulbul: what is an example of what you’re specifying? string or object?
[22:24:20] <Chulbul> Actions in zf2 always returns json, so in remote url, that url will either return json string like [true] or [false] but remote method expects simply true or false as a string. How to modify it so that it can read from json?
[22:28:25] <kevireilly_> Chulbul: ok, what are you specifying presently as `remote`? can you pastie.org an example
[22:29:46] <Chulbul> kevireilly_, ok
[22:33:33] <Chulbul> kevireilly_, http://pastie.org/9891542
[22:39:13] <kevireilly_> Chulbul: so, it seems like you are presently passing `remote` a string. Based on the documentation, it seems that you can optionally pass an object to provide the url as well as a lot of other nifty things http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax
[22:42:31] <Chulbul> kevireilly_, ah that means i can use all jquery.ajax methods like success where I can use json as well?
[22:43:34] <Chulbul> remote: function(){ url : , success: function(json) {console.log(json);}}
[22:45:35] <kevireilly_> yeah something in there should be the key, not sure if `success` or `complete` are required. Might just need to set the right accepts, contentType, or something
[22:46:56] <kevireilly_> remote: { url: ‘…’, accepts: ‘text/plain’ }
[22:47:49] <kevireilly_> maybe `dataType`
[22:48:28] <kevireilly_> remote: { url: ‘…’, accepts: ‘text/plain’, dataType: ‘text’ }
[22:48:29] <CoffeeMarker> hey
[22:48:41] <Chulbul> kevireilly_, thanks, let me try it :)
[22:49:00] <CoffeeMarker> I am having trouble selecting an object by attribute
[22:49:46] <CoffeeMarker> var database_id = 3;
[22:49:48] <CoffeeMarker> alert($('.trash').attr("db_id"));//prints 3
[22:49:49] <CoffeeMarker> alert($('.trash').find("[db_id='"+database_id+"']").length);//prints 0
[22:50:27] <CoffeeMarker> what is wrong in the last line?
[22:51:20] <kevireilly_> it would need to be a child with that attribute while using find
[22:51:37] <kevireilly_> attr is on the element itself
[22:53:01] <CoffeeMarker> oh, I see, thx
[22:54:17] <kevireilly_> CoffeeMarker: also maybe consider using data attributes $(‘.trash’).data(‘db_id’) <div class=“trash” data-db_id=“3”></div>
[22:55:32] <CoffeeMarker> what is the advantage of using data over attribute?
[22:57:13] <kevireilly_> anything else is considered non-standard and will fail to validate iirc
[22:57:25] <kevireilly_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes
[22:57:48] <Chulbul> kevireilly_, I can use success -> remote: { url: "/userprofile/edit", success: function(json){ 	return json[0]; } } but now how to trigger validation here with that returned json[0] value ??
[22:58:38] <kevireilly_> Chulbul: when I was thinking about those callbacks, I wondered the same thing which is partly why I suggested start with changing what the client expects in response
[22:59:24] <CoffeeMarker> I see, thx
[23:00:04] <kevireilly_> that way the standard handlers keep doing their thing
[23:00:30] <kevireilly_> Chulbul: the `converters` .ajax property seems interesting also
[23:01:24] <kevireilly_> oh, and `dataFilter` seems to let you modify the raw response
[23:02:08] <kevireilly_> “pre-filter”
[23:03:00] <Chulbul> kevireilly_, wow, that seems interesting, never tried all those options. But yeah these can make things possible. thanks a lot
[23:03:31] <kevireilly_> no problem
[23:23:33] <titii> Hi
[23:24:35] <titii> I get some html string result from $.get( ... ajax How can traversing over that to select some object, like $('.list-cards-wrap', data) ?
[23:25:45] <Cork> titii: yes
[23:25:52] <Cork> or $(data).find() (same thing)
[23:26:05] <tuskkk___> can someone please see why this isnt working as it should, http://jsfiddle.net/Lwko9v1u/
[23:26:19] <titii> i am converting the result to html like var html = $(data); alert($(html).length); is 3, but alert($('.list-cards-wrap', html).length); is 0
[23:26:44] <tuskkk___> this should work as the autoplay example here, http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[23:26:53] <Cork> titii: so the list isn't a child of any of the elements in the "html" variable
[23:28:03] <titii> Cork: but in the firebug in console i can see the .list-cards-wrap element
[23:28:19] <Cork> titii: it is the outer most element(s)?
[23:28:34] <Cork> meaning not a child
[23:29:10] <titii> Cork: yes it is, but moment, maybe it works already
[23:29:23] <Cork> titii: then you need to use $(html).filter(
[23:37:20] <titii> Cork: but i dont understand, console.log($(html).find('.list-cards-wrap')); got me the Object, but why console.log($(html).find('.list-cards-wrap').length); is 0 ?
[23:37:47] <Cork> titii: that isn't likely
[23:38:02] <Cork> actually i would go as far as to say it isn't possible
[23:38:52] <titii> Cork: Why? There is a .list-cards-wrap element, so it should find length 1
[23:39:08] <Cork> titii: then you need to use $(html).filter() <--
[23:39:14] <Cork> i already answered this
[23:39:18] <titii> Cork: so, how to check there is this element?
[23:39:23] <titii> filter?
[23:39:38] <Cork> find searches for a child to one of the outer elements in the set
[23:39:42] <Cork> filter filters the set
[23:40:07] <Cork> $('selector', target) is just a shorthand for $(target).find(
[23:51:36] <titii> Cork: ATW the $(html).filter('.list-cards-wrap').length is 1, dont understant why $(html).find('.list-cards-wrap').length is 0, when $(html).find('.list-cards-wrap') result some object, so he is the 1. Or not?
[23:51:56] <Cork> titii: i've already answered that
[23:52:04] <Cork> <Cork> find searches for a child to one of the outer elements in the set
[23:52:24] <Cork> you can't look for .list-cards-wrap inside .list-cards-wrap and expect to find it
[23:56:40] <titii> Cork: i see now, ok i was confused for me :) ty man
[23:56:56] <titii> Cork: .."it was confused for me"
[23:57:10] <Cork> i think the word you're looking for is "confusing"
[23:57:25] <titii> Cork: yes :)
[23:57:39] <titii> atw ty
[23:57:43] <Cork> np
