[02:55:13] <Peppi> hello
[02:56:04] <robertmaxrees> hola
[02:56:43] <Peppi> trying to use cheerio (uses jquery) to scrape some data from a website
[02:56:53] <Peppi> just having noob issues
[02:57:04] <robertmaxrees> like?
[02:58:22] <robertmaxrees> (also cheerio doesn't "use jquery" - it's a separte thing that implements a subset of jquery's features)
[02:58:25] <Peppi> well I have it as far as getting to right element and I see a child node with my data but am not sure how to "get it"
[02:59:05] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty vague.  can you be a little more specific?  maybe make a test case on jsfiddle?
[02:59:18] <Peppi> ya I guess
[02:59:51] <robertmaxrees> also: cheerio is intended for the server.
[03:00:02] <Peppi> robertmaxrees, yes
[03:00:40] <robertmaxrees> cool.  yeah, would need to see a test case then.  can't guarantee i can help much since it isn't jquery but hey, worth a shot ;)
[03:01:20] <Peppi> it's simple
[03:01:30] <Peppi> but will take me some time to get a test case
[03:01:37] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue then?
[03:02:16] <robertmaxrees> test cases should be minimal and straightforward.  like, 5 minutes or less to make :)
[03:06:56] <Peppi> ya I'm slow lol
[03:07:08] <Peppi> actually can I pm you for a second?
[03:07:15] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[03:07:40] <robertmaxrees> if you can't share it to the channel, doesn't make sense to share it with me.  still just a random stranger on the internet.
[03:07:51] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to select a descendent element or something?
[03:08:02] <Peppi> oh just to send you the url... but ya lol
[03:08:08] <Peppi> no nothing crazy
[03:08:19] <robertmaxrees> if cheerio has it, .find() is probably what you want.
[03:08:39] <Peppi> maybe it's just late and I can't think
[03:08:55] <robertmaxrees> $('.foo').find('.bar');
[03:09:46] <Peppi> no it's stupid simple
[03:09:54] <robertmaxrees> so then what is it??
[03:09:56] <Peppi> anyhow: here is the html: <a href="/system4.aspx" target="_self">Distribution is underway</a> â€“81,561 units as of January 15.
[03:10:20] <robertmaxrees> what of that do you want?
[03:10:29] <Peppi> I'm trying to parse out the 81,561
[03:10:35] <Peppi> but it's outside the a?
[03:11:08] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple test case then.
[03:11:44] <Peppi> yes
[03:11:46] <Peppi> like I said
[03:12:21] <Peppi> I just don't get html nor do I get jquery / cheerio
[03:12:34] <Peppi> at this point I'm thinking I don't get node either :/
[03:12:35] <robertmaxrees> that's a convoluted case fwiw.
[03:12:37] <robertmaxrees> so it's werid.
[03:12:39] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[03:13:49] <Peppi> currently I'm doing a: const foo = $(element).find("a").attr("href");
[03:14:01] <robertmaxrees> you said youu wanted the number, right?
[03:14:04] <Peppi> ya
[03:14:14] <Peppi> the entire text is fine too
[03:14:18] <Peppi> I can parse no problem
[03:15:43] <robertmaxrees> grabbing the href will just get you '/system4.aspx'
[03:15:47] <robertmaxrees> which isn't what you want.
[03:15:51] <Peppi> yes
[03:16:19] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to do something like $theThing.html().replace($theThing.find('a').html(), '');
[03:16:36] <robertmaxrees> there $theThing is whatever the parent node is.
[03:18:02] <Peppi> well what I'm doing is getting the parent div and then const foo = bar.find("p"); then I do a $(foo).each... and iterate through them until I hit the href I want... aka the element but note sure what to do from there. I see the element has 2 child nodes and I want the second one
[03:18:29] <robertmaxrees> instead of guessing games: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uthge6dx/
[03:18:35] <robertmaxrees> update that HTML with whatever you have :)
[03:18:48] <robertmaxrees> since you're changing the issue now :)
[03:19:22] <Peppi> lol k
[03:26:43] <Peppi> do you see what I have?
[03:27:12] <robertmaxrees> no... you need to make your changes, click "save" at the top, and then send me the new URL.
[03:28:10] <Peppi> sent
[03:28:18] <robertmaxrees> in the channel, i mean :)
[03:28:22] <Peppi> https://jsfiddle.net/8dm635Lb/
[03:28:42] <robertmaxrees> so which element are you trying to select?
[03:28:49] <robertmaxrees> or elements?
[03:29:14] <Peppi> the number 81561 in this case
[03:29:56] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so you'll want to change your approach entirely.  what's the root node for this chunk of html?  a div?
[03:30:18] <Peppi> oops second
[03:31:13] <Peppi> https://jsfiddle.net/8dm635Lb/2/
[03:31:37] <Peppi> ya there is that div
[03:32:05] <robertmaxrees> okay.  fwiw, at least in jquery, you don't need to "re-wrap" doses - it's already a jquery object.  not sure if cheerio is the same way but i'd guess it is.
[03:32:13] <robertmaxrees> either way - you don't want 'each' here.
[03:32:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd start with a 'filter'
[03:33:23] <Peppi> ok
[03:34:34] <robertmaxrees> so you'd start with something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/adsLoc3q/
[03:36:25] <robertmaxrees> and then you'd remove the text of the anchor tag from the text of that p tag, which looks something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/adsLoc3q/1/
[03:36:25] <Peppi> ok sec
[03:41:09] <Peppi> weird...
[03:41:13] <robertmaxrees> ?
[03:41:25] <Peppi> just confirming one second
[03:41:38] <Peppi> oh I'm an idiot... one second
[03:45:17] <Peppi> hmm yes it worked... now I gotta look at it some more
[03:45:32] <robertmaxrees> ask questions :)
[03:45:48] <Peppi> ok I don't understand the $
[03:45:55] <Peppi> $allPTags
[03:45:58] <Peppi> as an example
[03:46:11] <robertmaxrees> that just signifies that it's a jquery object (or cheerio object)
[03:46:22] <Peppi> ok so it's nothing special then
[03:46:25] <robertmaxrees> no functional meaning, just makes the code clearer.
[03:46:50] <Peppi> ok great, nice convention I'll use it
[03:46:54] <robertmaxrees> helps you avoid doing things like passing a jquery object to $() again :)
[03:47:03] <Peppi> yes
[03:47:19] <robertmaxrees> many methods return a jquery object, so that reminder is helpful.
[03:51:02] <Peppi> the rest I understand... although...
[03:51:13] <robertmaxrees> ?
[03:51:40] <Peppi> textWithoutTheAnchorText you just replaced the first text with ''
[03:51:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[03:52:22] <Peppi> I'm looking at $thePTagIWant in the debugger and I can see that it has 2 children
[03:52:32] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[03:52:34] <Peppi> how would I select the second child?
[03:52:38] <Peppi> sort of?
[03:52:42] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't go that route.
[03:52:48] <Peppi> why?
[03:53:33] <robertmaxrees> first off: any time you say you want an element via some ordinal concept (ie "the second child"), you should stop since that's a bad way to look at it.
[03:53:39] <robertmaxrees> in this case, the "second child" is actually a text node.
[03:54:09] <robertmaxrees> in this case, you want to extract a string that doesn't include text from another element.
[03:54:15] <robertmaxrees> that's why i used that replace.
[03:54:38] <Peppi> ok
[03:55:08] <robertmaxrees> it cuts out a bunch of headaches and gets you much closer to what you want in a much simpler fashion: treat the contents of the <p> as a string and remove the text that's part of the <a>
[03:55:27] <Peppi> yes
[03:55:29] <robertmaxrees> also helps you avoid regular expressions.
[03:55:33] <Peppi> lol
[03:55:55] <Peppi> about to ask. For parsing what would you recomend as a method?
[03:56:29] <robertmaxrees> in this case?  i'm going to assume the format is generally "{number} doeses administered as of {date}"
[03:56:35] <robertmaxrees> that sound about right?
[03:56:51] <Peppi> ya
[03:57:02] <Peppi> don't need the date fyi
[03:57:13] <Peppi> just the number is fine
[03:57:29] <robertmaxrees> easy - it's not obvious, but that string actually contains a delimiter.
[03:58:14] <Peppi> , ?
[03:58:38] <robertmaxrees> "{number} doeses administered as of {date}"
[03:58:50] <Peppi> spaces
[03:58:52] <robertmaxrees> ' doeses administered as of ' is your delimiter
[03:59:01] <Peppi> oh lol
[04:00:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/adsLoc3q/2/
[04:00:22] <robertmaxrees> just gotta clean up that ' - ' and you're done.
[04:03:01] <Peppi> cool cool
[04:03:05] <Peppi> thanks a lot :)
[04:04:03] <robertmaxrees> the old Zawinski quote comes to mind - 'Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.'
[04:04:20] <Peppi> I'm with you on that one
[04:04:59] <robertmaxrees> sometimes they're unavoidable, but most of the time you don't need them :)
[04:05:26] <Peppi> ya
[04:06:02] <Peppi> the people who can do them are just wired differently.... or at least differently then me
[04:06:47] <robertmaxrees> nah.  every time you look up the reference and SO articles, implement it, and then don't look at it for years and forget everything you leanred the next time you pick them up.
[05:37:40] <Jaseinatl> where do you stop delegating events to a higher element? In other words, if it's a good idea to delegate click events on buttons to their parent (allowing all buttons to be controled with one controller), wouldn't logic follow that you would delegate all events from the body element? how do you decide were to stop delegating?
[05:39:25] <robertmaxrees> bind to the "component" - attaching to the body means you're listening to everything that happens on the page.  that means you'll evbentually end up having to write logic that determines whether or not you should handle a particular event.
[05:40:03] <Jaseinatl> thanks for replying. So not to the group of components, but rather each component?
[05:40:13] <robertmaxrees> depending, yes.
[05:40:28] <Jaseinatl> right on. Thanks.
[05:40:45] <robertmaxrees> that makes it clear what your intent it/was.  intent is often overlooked.
[05:45:02] <Jaseinatl> I see in some jquery where a js object is used to be able to encapsulate methods. How doe you know when it needs that or when it's okay to just attach event handlers without the object. Sorry if that's not making sense.
[05:46:28] <robertmaxrees> doesn't make sense.  sorry.
[05:49:18] <Jaseinatl> I've been trying off an on for several years to make an alignment object. It would allow you to use methods like $(element).alignby('top.left'); $(element2).alignby('bottomleft'); $(element2).alignTo($(element)) so that the bottom left corner of element 2 would align to the topleft corner of element.
[05:50:10] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with event handlers fwiw.
[05:50:45] <Jaseinatl> I thought that I would create an object that could be stored in a data property that would indicate the preferred alignment point. So that way when I dragged an element, it would snap to it's preferred alignment point, for example.
[05:51:41] <Jaseinatl> So I never know how robust to the make the alignment object. Should it manage the drag events for it's target? Align events for it's targets, etc.
[05:51:56] <robertmaxrees> that's a little more than what you typically want from an event handler ;)  sounds like a fully seperate library tbh,
[05:52:28] <Jaseinatl> so maybe the term I am using when is a js object is really js library that I am trying to create.
[05:52:57] <Jaseinatl> That was supposed to say "when I say js object" sorry
[05:53:29] <robertmaxrees> back up from that - there are whole plugins/libraries dedicated to that kind of layout logic.
[05:58:02] <Jaseinatl> I guess the difference that I am finding is that I don't want to have to know the alignment of the elements in advance. I want them to hold their own alignment properties so that elem1.alignTo(elem2) aligns the point preferred by elem1 to the poin t preferred by elem2, with options like animate, or override (to use elem1s alignment instead of its targets).
[05:58:50] <robertmaxrees> sure - that's a whole seperate library/framework from what jquery does.  nothing wrong with that.
[06:00:47] <Jaseinatl> Right. I am trying to figure out if the library should extend jquery with these events or if it should be it's own methods. AlignLib.align(elem1, elem2) or $(elem1), alignTo(elem2) for example.
[06:01:43] <Jaseinatl> Thanks for your help. I think I'll just try it both ways and hopefully one will become clear. Sorry to take up your time. I always appreciate your input.
[06:02:11] <robertmaxrees> depends on your intent.  popovers?  jquery plugin.  page layout?  seperate thing.
[16:07:06] <Peppi> robertmaxrees, btw it was late last night but thank you for all the help :D
