[01:43:42] <hi-liter99> anyone have experience building a suggestive search using jquery and ajax?
[02:43:31] <elpiiias> hiii
[02:43:42] <elpiiias> i have that simple code
[02:43:43] <elpiiias> <script>
[02:43:43] <elpiiias> $(document).ready(function(){
[02:43:43] <elpiiias>      $("#form1").submit();
[02:43:43] <elpiiias> });
[02:43:43] <elpiiias> </script>
[02:44:00] <elpiiias> how can i do it only to work at once? like it is now is doing it loop
[02:46:53] <elpiiias> $(document).one('ready',function(){
[02:46:58] <elpiiias> i did it also like that and not working
[02:51:03] <pavonia> Is the action of that submit the same document where you put that code?
[02:51:35] <elpiiias> yes..
[02:52:09] <elpiiias> i tried everything to not getting loop
[02:52:12] <elpiiias> and i cant find :(
[02:52:23] <pavonia> Then you need to submit a hidden field to the server that the script should be disabled on the next submit or so
[02:53:40] <elpiiias> can u give me an example if i paste it somewhere?
[02:55:30] <elpiiias> https://jsfiddle.net/g73w3cvx/
[02:55:31] <elpiiias> here it is
[02:55:34] <pavonia> It just a new element `<input type="hidden" name="hideSubmitScript" value="1">` that you put in your document
[02:56:40] <pavonia> When the server receives a request with that field set, it respons with a document that doesn't include the JS code for the submission
[02:58:01] <pavonia> Why do you submit that form on document.ready anyway? Doesn't make much sense to me
[03:05:43] <elpiiias> especially i want to have auto submi
[03:05:44] <elpiiias> t
[03:05:59] <elpiiias> i am new at jquery so of course i have some mistakes..
[03:08:59] <pavonia> What do you mean by auto submit? How would the fields be filled in that case?
[03:12:19] <elpiiias> i am doing the fields through post..
[03:12:45] <elpiiias> especially i will tell you what i am doing..
[03:12:50] <elpiiias> i have a wordpress and a joomla website..
[03:13:03] <elpiiias> but both of them are 1 site
[03:13:16] <elpiiias> and i am sending the users from wordpress to joomla
[03:13:19] <elpiiias> through post
[03:13:42] <elpiiias> so the users when they register to my website to not need register double
[03:18:52] <pavonia> elpiiias: A hidden field is your best bet then, I think
[04:12:02] <Sayona_> Hi, at this code https://paste.laravel.io/DN1wZ#1 I get TypeError: demo2.find(...).size is not a function
[04:27:49] <getbuttonid> If i have a div at the top of my HTML page with multiple buttons, how would I use jquery to grab a specific name of a button?
[04:27:55] <getbuttonid> Using the .html() function just gives me "undefined"
[04:28:36] <getbuttonid> In my onClick function I have $( this ).html() which returns all the buttons instead of one
[04:40:30] <Duikb00t-home> Hi
[06:45:09] <postget> posting data from html file to server.js file on same port. how can i retrieve (get) data from html and display on console.
[06:45:49] <postget> I want to GET data from the HTML on my JS file and display on console. how_
[08:39:33] <petersmith> I fear I know the answer is "no" but is there anyway I can silently add to the value of a text input. I'm trying to make searches a lot more accurate and I want to do this by suffixing the search term but I fear it may be a negative user experience for them to see the suffixing
[09:31:13] <SomeJQ> Is there a way to stop a scroll event from appending a class in the console?
[10:32:24] <quechon> wat up guys
[10:37:14] <quechon> i have a button that when clicked it send get request  to server and creates a zip file now in ajax success how can i trigger that zip file to download without opening a new tab
[10:45:18] <SomeJQ> quechon are you using window.open?
[10:45:38] <SomeJQ> you can use window.location.href = url; when forcing the download so it can be on the same page
[10:59:00] <quechon> no havent tried that yet
[11:48:37] <G66K> hello everyone im new to jquery im trying to insert html content after the second div https://jsfiddle.net/a9b4qoup/
[11:48:59] <G66K> no idea what im doing wrong
[12:03:13] <pavonia> Fix your markup first
[12:21:32] <robertmaxrees> Goooooood morning #jquery
[12:22:33] <catbadger> hi
[12:22:35] <catbadger> :)
[12:22:38] <robertmaxrees> hola
[12:23:05] <catbadger> is it cool if I pm you robertmaxrees?
[12:23:10] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[12:23:17] <robertmaxrees> Is it a question about jquery or...?
[12:24:00] <catbadger> nope. I'd keep htat in channel
[12:33:42] <goodenough> $(document).ready(function(){console.log('hey jquery');});
[12:33:51] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[12:34:08] <catbadger> debug('i write a debug function for this exact reason');
[12:34:24] <catbadger> ;)
[12:35:26] <taplar> goodenough: what's the question?
[12:35:44] <goodenough> no questions, just saying hi
[12:36:14] <catbadger> taplar is all business this morning ;)
[12:36:43] <taplar> had a vaca, so now i'm all work work work
[12:36:59] <catbadger> lucky. I staycay.
[12:37:07] <robertmaxrees> hah
[12:37:24] <catbadger> take time off and stay home with baby. but i live in Penticton/Kelowna, so it's basically Canadian Hawaii.
[12:37:57] <taplar> same with me, sans the baby
[12:38:25] <MikeD_> Canadian Hawaii?  is that like a thinly sliced leaner version of US Hawaii?  :0
[12:41:49] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:46:05] <catbadger> MikeD_ everything in Canada is thinner.
[12:46:18] <catbadger> ;)
[12:46:51] <MikeD_> compared to US, surely
[12:46:54] <catbadger> lol
[12:47:11] <catbadger> yeah it's jsut a nice area. awesome climate, nice lakes
[12:47:31] <MikeD_> i looked on google map, was expecting to see a canadian island
[12:51:48] <catbadger> lol
[12:52:05] <catbadger> naw that's vancouver island (andarea)
[12:52:09] <catbadger> and area
[12:52:31] <catbadger> sorry guys my bad for being way off topic. i'm going back to my javascript for a bit. :)
[13:01:29] <robertmaxrees> nah it's all good.
[13:06:42] <MikeD_> do you use eslint?
[13:07:48] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[13:08:29] <MikeD_> if you have line comments in a block of code, do you think they're supposed to move with the rest of the lines in a block?
[13:10:28] <robertmaxrees> HRM?
[13:10:30] <robertmaxrees> *hrm?
[13:11:20] <MikeD_> we have a eslint --fix running on git commit via husky... and the resulting rewrite of the "code" is not moving the inline comments to align with the rewritten block
[13:12:07] <MikeD_> i feel the person obsessing over the column alignment of a comment needs to get some work done and merge the damned pull requests... but instead he's looking for eslint switches to fix whitespace issues
[13:12:30] <MikeD_> ... since he's the boss, no *I'M* looking for switches
[13:13:04] <robertmaxrees> well
[13:13:32] <robertmaxrees> code quality and tech debt are a big deal.  and paying attentioo to details can save you a whole lotta headaches down the road.
[13:14:13] <robertmaxrees> i know they're "just comments" buuuut at the same time I've been bitten by inaccurate comments quite a bit.
[13:14:38] <Uhkis> never trust comments, they're just decoys for the serial killer
[13:14:49] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[13:14:49] <taplar> i was just recently bitten by the wrong card number put on the commits.  that was fun trying to find those changes
[13:15:04] <MikeD_> yeah, thanks for the term i'd never heard it as "tech debt" but we're in up to our eyeballs...
[13:15:08] <robertmaxrees> i've just stopped reading them for the most part >.>
[13:15:22] <robertmaxrees> and get picky over function names.
[13:15:37] <MikeD_> but if the // comment starts the slashes at column 8 and the line the follows starts on column 6, are you going to sweat that ?
[13:15:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:15:52] <robertmaxrees> always.
[13:16:13] <robertmaxrees> it's not necessarily about the comment itself.  that's part of it - breaking the visual flow of code to make it easy to identify blocks is a thing.
[13:16:34] <taplar> heh, personally i'd ask why there is a comment, but that's just me
[13:17:02] <robertmaxrees> but also, i see it kind of the same way van halen did when they'd ask for a bowl on M&Ms backstage with all the, say, brown ones removed.
[13:17:11] <MikeD_> yeah, and if he wasn't such a baby that we had to have a rewriter beautify the code, then it would be fine because as-written it all lines up nicely.
[13:17:38] <Uhkis> MikeD_: friendly reminder, this channel is logged publicly on the inter webs
[13:18:10] <MikeD_> thanks... i'll call him a baby directly :)
[13:18:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[13:18:52] <MikeD_> admittedly, having an automatic code formatter on checkin is kinda nice
[13:19:02] <robertmaxrees> ^ so so so nice.
[13:19:21] <robertmaxrees> we actually check that before deploy and if the code changes post-beautification, we stop.
[13:19:39] <MikeD_> i'm just surprised that ignoring the prefix indentation on a "comment line" is the default
[13:19:59] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) there are all kinds of wonky defaults for those.
[13:20:33] <Uhkis> MikeD_: lol
[13:21:41] <taplar> https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3845 ???
[13:23:06] <MikeD_> yeah
[13:26:41] <MikeD_> have you ever seen anyone line comment AFTER a function call ?
[13:26:55] <taplar> sure
[13:27:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.  depends on what the comment is addressing.
[13:27:22] <robertmaxrees> but that's kinda weird if it's for the function.
[13:27:28] <MikeD_> hmm... it would never occur to me to do that
[13:27:39] <taplar> refreshDate(); //repull user's information
[13:27:42] <robertmaxrees> it's weird, for sure.
[13:27:50] <taplar> or whatevs
[13:28:05] <MikeD_> that's on the same line, i meant on a line by itself
[13:28:10] <MikeD_> ... after the call line
[13:28:22] <taplar> that refers to the previous function?
[13:28:29] <MikeD_> heh, ikr weird.
[13:28:38] <taplar> don't think i've seen that
[13:29:10] <MikeD_> https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/7618  CTRL-F "difficult to tell"
[13:29:24] <taplar> but really we try to avoid comments as much as possible.  comments can be a smell that the logic clarity is low
[13:29:38] <MikeD_> are you being facetious?
[13:29:41] <taplar> nope
[13:29:50] <taplar> though i have to google that word
[13:30:04] <taplar> no[pe
[13:30:04] <robertmaxrees> your code should be crystal clear.  and your code reviews should verify that functions are doing what their names say.
[13:30:12] <robertmaxrees> not more or less
[13:30:14] <taplar> we are big believers in self documentation
[13:32:09] <MikeD_> do you have a chunk of code you could jsfiddle for example?  i'm curious to see it
[13:32:37] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:32:40] <robertmaxrees> that's loaded.
[13:32:53] <robertmaxrees> domain knowledge is always going to play a role.
[13:33:37] <taplar> not sure what i could share.  it's mostly proprietary
[13:34:56] <taplar> yeah, looking at stuff, i wouldn't feel safe in sharing it out
[13:35:54] <taplar> however it's not an uncommon sentiment.  self documentation is a pretty big thing
[13:36:15] <taplar> modular, self documenting code.  all that jazz
[13:36:26] <robertmaxrees> if something is confusing enough to warrant a comment, why not just rewrite it so it's less confusing?
[13:36:44] <robertmaxrees> also: your git history will be able to tell you why a change was made./
[14:13:42] <someJQ> Is there a way to stop a scroll event from appending a class through console?
[14:14:44] <taplar> scroll events don't inherently append classes to things.  there would have to be some script that is doing that.
[14:19:32] <MikeD_> boss came over the screw up package.json...   (and still isn't fixed) - but I understand self-documenting code, I was just looking for an example of good/clean code because what we have here as a matter of course is none of the above.
[14:27:49] <taplar> it might be easier to take an example of unclear code and refactor it to be more self documenting
[14:35:52] <catbadger> there we go
[14:45:33] <catbadger> ugh. why is it that people think storing everything in global scope is ok?
[14:46:47] <bomb> whta's wrong with that? /t
[14:46:57] <catbadger> lol
[14:47:09] <catbadger> it's sloppy in million-line systems for one.
[14:47:50] <bomb> doctor forbids me to look at more than 10kloc JS codebases anyway
[14:48:34] <catbadger> rofl lucky
[14:48:39] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:48:43] <robertmaxrees> 10k is nothing
[14:49:13] <catbadger> in all fairness, 70% of my dayjob's codebase is php. and the total lines is 1M
[14:49:15] <catbadger> is
[14:49:17] <catbadger> ish
[14:49:58] <taplar> i miss jquery questions
[14:50:36] <bomb> we can always ask each other
[14:50:50] <catbadger> lol try #javascript it's full of leeches.
[14:50:53] <catbadger> ;)
[14:50:59] <bomb> hi how can i compute the length of a string in jquery??
[14:52:35] <catbadger> HAHAHA
[14:52:49] <catbadger> as with most things you don't need jquery.
[14:52:50] <Uhkis> var i = 0; $.each('string', function() { ++i; });
[14:52:52] <Uhkis> maybe ;DOt
[14:53:13] <bomb> haha lovely
[14:53:14] <Uhkis> what a horrible typo after that smiley
[14:53:15] <catbadger> "asdfasdf".length
[14:53:23] <Uhkis> catbadger: -1 not enough jquery :D
[14:53:28] <catbadger> haha
[14:53:30] <catbadger> <3
[14:53:37] <bomb> anyway, thank you. i found a jquery plugin for that
[14:53:44] <catbadger> BAHAHAHA
[14:53:52] <catbadger> i love this room
[14:54:01] <Uhkis> now i have to try if that actually works
[14:55:18] <Uhkis> darn, doesnt
[14:55:55] <taplar> gotta split('') first
[14:56:02] <bomb> ^
[14:56:39] <Uhkis> :D
[14:58:20] <Uhkis> now someone make an actual jquery plugin out of that
[14:59:23] <bomb> we're late
[14:59:39] <bomb> make it a react plugin, then instant frontpage on HN and r/programming
[15:00:17] <Uhkis> HN?
[15:00:26] <bomb> hacker news
[15:39:14] <alturic> Hey guys, I'm trying to get an attribute from 4 input radio's current checked selection, and while I can seem to get the basics working, it's returning the previous checked option instead of the current?
[15:39:38] <taplar> show us what you are doing?
[15:40:24] <alturic> Hmm, perhaps it's because I'm on('click'... on the div containing the inputs, let me check that first.
[15:42:59] <alturic> Hmm, it works fine on jsfiddle... it has to be something with the way datatables works with radio inputs or something.
[16:45:34] <alturic> does anyone have any experience with datatables?
[16:45:58] <robertmaxrees> lots of people do heh.
[16:45:58] <alturic> particularly how on init it clears radio input's that are checked="checked"
[16:46:06] <robertmaxrees> i can highly recommend their forums tho.
[16:46:24] <alturic> robertmaxrees: Yea, their forums are basically "oh yea, its a huge known bug, good luck"
[16:46:31] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:46:39] <robertmaxrees> just sayin' :)
[16:47:18] <alturic> Sadly, looking on google for a tables based on a div grid seems non-existant, when you want to start getting the features like pagination, and sorting.
[16:47:40] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:40:12] <Inari-> Hi hi. I'm trying to use jQuery's Autocomplete stuff, but it seems the Flatsome Wordpress thingy doesn't quite like it. It seems to have a "killerfn" to disable jQuery's auto suggestions to replace with its own or so (flatsome-live-search). Any good ideas on dealing with that? D:
[17:40:52] <robertmaxrees> what's the "killerfn"?
[17:44:11] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) #welp
[17:44:22] <Inari-> Seems to do a(document).on("click.autocomplete", b.killerFn) to attach it..
[17:44:32] <Inari-> Then "0 === a(b.target).closest("." + d.options.containerClass).length && (d.killSuggestions()" in the killerfn
[17:44:39] <robertmaxrees> so it's actually called "killerfn"?
[17:45:00] <Inari-> Yeah xD
[17:45:06] <Inari-> https://pastebin.com/ZV8T1buY is killSuggestions
[17:45:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd read the docs for that wp plugin then.
[17:45:44] <Inari-> Well I tried searching there docs, but nothing seemed to come up
[17:46:19] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to add autocomplete, yeah? gotta link to their docs?
[17:46:33] <Inari-> http://docs.uxthemes.com/
[17:47:15] <Inari-> And yeah, tryin gto use jQuery UI Autocomplete
[17:47:45] <robertmaxrees> did you pay for this theme?
[17:48:09] <Inari-> No, the person who's using it did. Though I believe their support expired since then
[17:48:20] <robertmaxrees> of course.
[17:48:21] <robertmaxrees> well.
[17:48:29] <robertmaxrees> you could always try to kill that handler.
[17:48:35] <Inari-> Yeah
[17:48:39] <Inari-> Just not sure how to get at that D:
[17:48:54] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[17:49:32] <Inari-> I wanted to ask in their community forum but that also wants a key... :P And while I can have it (it's displayedin wordpress) I'd rather not register it to my account since I'm just adding something, not howning it
[17:49:52] <Inari-> Have to try off again yeah
[17:49:57] <robertmaxrees> sure, but you actually do need support ;)
[17:49:58] <Inari-> Last I tried I didn't manage to really make it do much
[17:50:05] <robertmaxrees> what did you try?
[17:50:31] <Inari-> $(document).off('click.autocomplete'); or so as far as I recall
[17:51:11] <robertmaxrees> need to pass the selector, too.
[17:52:39] <Inari-> The docs seem to mark that as optional, but what would it be? it seems to only apss the event and handler in .on
[17:53:04] <robertmaxrees> ah nevermind.  misread your code.  code pasts in the channel are hard to read.
[17:53:13] <robertmaxrees> you sure your code is running after the WP plugin's?
[17:53:37] <Inari-> Well I tried it in the console, so it should
[17:53:58] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) dunno then.  you're not, like, running multiple copies of jquery on the page or something right?
[17:53:59] <Inari-> Interesting point though ^^" Will have to see about that once I solve it in console
[17:56:29] <Inari-> Hmm not sure, will have to check. And I'll try around again. I don't have much experience working with/against javascript that is minified and tries to encapsulate itself
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to check usually.
[17:57:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd start by just viewing the rendered page source for jquery.js and see if that shows up a few times.
[17:57:17] <robertmaxrees> without a plugin name in front of it.
[18:02:21] <Inari-> Hm seems to be only once in the chrom einspector's sourcecode view
[18:42:19] <ajf-> How can I encode a deep (2 levels) object into form inputs so that the form sends a get request with the object properly formed? is there an easy way or do I need to iterate over the object and build the input fields manually ?
[18:42:51] <robertmaxrees> the latter.
[18:44:38] <ajf-> ok
[19:08:21] <Inari-> robertmaxrees: Anyway will try around more tomorrow. Thanks for the help ^^
[19:17:33] <robertmaxrees> definitely.  good luck!
[19:37:39] <arosen> any idea why if i do: $("body").text() I get: "Uncaught Type error $(..).text is not a function
[19:38:11] <robertmaxrees> arosen you in the chrome js console?
[19:38:16] <arosen> yes
[19:38:24] <robertmaxrees> try $.fn.jquery
[19:38:26] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[19:38:50] <arosen> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined
[19:38:50] <arosen>     at <anonymous>:1:5
[19:38:55] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:38:58] <robertmaxrees> so jquery isn't loaded.
[19:38:58] <arosen> i guess that's why :)
[19:39:04] <robertmaxrees> $ is a shortcut to document.querySelector :)
[19:39:08] <robertmaxrees> in chrome.
[19:39:11] <robertmaxrees> when jquery doesn't exist.
[19:39:14] <arosen> i included: <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js" integrity="sha256-Qw82+bXyGq6MydymqBxNPYTaUXXq7c8v3CwiYwLLNXU=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> to the header
[19:39:20] <robertmaxrees> or is it querySelectorAll...
[19:39:21] <arosen> but i wonder if it doesn't load if i add that after
[19:39:30] <arosen> cool well that answers my question. Thanks :)
[19:39:32] <robertmaxrees> well, is the page https?
[19:40:01] <robertmaxrees> also: your code must come after jquery is loaded.
[23:59:14] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[23:59:56] <randymarsh9> if i do $.getJSON or  $.ajax they are both using ajax right?
