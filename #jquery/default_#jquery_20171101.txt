[03:23:38] <senaps> i have a  {} value inside an array in the localstorage! how would i remove it?
[03:24:44] <senaps> http://jsfiddle.net/Lz63dc5v/
[04:07:46] <Cork> senaps: http://jsfiddle.net/Lz63dc5v/1/
[04:08:18] <senaps> yup it did  the trick.... thanks
[04:11:14] <Cork> senaps: that command just removes the first element in the array, it isn't to remove empty objects
[04:19:50] <senaps> im adding something to page using jqeury. now using another function im trying to remove it. is there something like document.ready i should be using? i guess my remove function doesn't see actions taken by adder function!
[04:20:20] <Cork> senaps: there isn't a way to tell when something changes the page
[04:20:28] <Cork> your function has to communicate
[04:20:44] <Cork> ex. $.Callback can help
[04:31:45] <senaps> wouldn't callback automatically call those functions?
[04:32:20] <Cork> its just a way to allow a caller to add callbacks into the function
[04:32:55] <Cork> or you can have a shared variable with an object with callbacks they can call to trigger back and forth
[04:36:33] <senaps> on page load, i look for data and add them to the page, later user may decide to edit or delete those things.... from what i know about callbacks in python and what they are described in jquery, the callbacks run automatically after previous func is done
[04:36:58] <senaps> so, i need a callback thing inside that to check onclick event and something like that right?
[04:37:01] <Cork> no, there is no automatic callbacks
[04:37:20] <Cork> the callbacks run when you call them
[04:38:41] <Cork> ex. var handle = $.Callbacks(); /* async function */ handle.fire(newData); /* end */  return handle;
[04:39:18] <Cork> but note i talk about this in the abstract, as there isn't any real case to talk about
[04:41:59] <senaps> http://jsfiddle.net/xorx11g8/
[04:42:35] <senaps> huh.... so my code is wrong... i thought i should handle it like that.
[04:43:57] <senaps> calling remove item from that anonymous function would work right? is that considered a callback?
[04:57:48] <Cork> senaps: http://jsfiddle.net/xorx11g8/1/
[07:52:22] <hellyeah> what did i do wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/bpubg1qg/
[08:00:54] <Cork> hellyeah: don't use alert for debugging
[08:00:58] <Kartagis> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/bpubg1qg/1/
[08:01:17] <Kartagis> and it's mouseover, not hover
[08:01:49] <Cork> depend :P http://jsfiddle.net/bpubg1qg/2/
[08:02:55] <graingert> hellyeah: you also need to import jquery
[08:02:56] <graingert> http://jsfiddle.net/rscmk315/
[08:03:44] <hellyeah> i imported
[08:03:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:04:07] <graingert> http://jsfiddle.net/rscmk315/1/
[08:04:19] <hellyeah> hover should work
[08:04:23] <graingert> wfm
[08:04:27] <graingert> with https://unpkg.com/jquery@3.2.1
[08:04:28] <hellyeah> wfm?
[08:05:09] <graingert> works for me
[08:05:23] <Cork> hellyeah: hover is a jquery fake function
[08:05:31] <Cork> it isn't a dom event
[08:05:34] <hellyeah> ah
[08:05:41] <hellyeah> oh
[08:05:43] <hellyeah> i see
[08:05:44] <Cork> and is why i gave you http://jsfiddle.net/bpubg1qg/2/
[08:05:53] <hellyeah> why jquery need fake event
[08:06:01] <Cork> cause it is a short hand
[08:06:12] <hellyeah> shorthand of what?
[08:06:26] <Cork> .hover(func1, func2) == .on('mouseenter', func1).on('mouseleave', func2)
[08:06:54] <hellyeah> btw
[08:06:56] <Cork> also mouseenter and mouseleave is also fake events :)
[08:07:08] <hellyeah> mouseover, mouseenter doesnt seem really different to me
[08:07:10] <Cork> but they are to filter out bubbled events from child elements
[08:07:26] <hellyeah> ah
[08:07:33] <Cork> hellyeah: mouseover fires every time you move from one element to another
[08:07:43] <Cork> no matter if it is a child of the current element or not
[08:07:57] <Cork> mouseenter only fires when you move into the element or one of its children
[08:08:05] <hellyeah> I see
[08:08:13] <Cork> never when you move from a parent to a child or the other way around
[08:08:43] <Cork> (this is well documented in api.jquery.com)
[08:09:04] <hellyeah> so
[08:09:09] <graingert> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/rscmk315/2/
[08:09:11] <hellyeah> hover is just a wrapper
[08:10:17] <hellyeah> thanks graingert
[08:21:47] <hellyeah> hey what did i do wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/bpubg1qg/3/
[08:22:55] <Cork> what did you expect it should do?
[08:25:03] <hellyeah> i expect to show tooltip when i hover the div
[08:25:30] <hellyeah> is it false expectation?
[08:26:03] <Cork> hellyeah: if you put the content in the div; sure http://jsfiddle.net/bpubg1qg/4/
[08:26:41] <Cork> though doing the change on hover is kinda wasteful
[08:26:56] <Cork> you should prob look into the hooks for the tooltip plugin
[08:27:47] <hellyeah> i give an education about flebox
[08:27:55] <hellyeah> and i will seperate page into div
[08:28:24] <hellyeah> and when student hover the div they will know which div it is they work with
[08:28:41] <hellyeah> doesnt it make sense?
[08:32:47] <hellyeah> or anyway
[08:32:53] <hellyeah> i will make that simpler
[08:41:56] <hellyeah> i am not sure how it worked http://jsfiddle.net/bpubg1qg/6/
[08:41:59] <hellyeah> did it work for you
[08:42:12] <hellyeah> when you hover the div it will show class name as tooltip
[08:42:14] <hellyeah> wth
[08:42:55] <Cork> yes as the title attribute is shown as a tooltip by the browser
[08:43:16] <Cork> but it is also what the .tooltip() plugin uses as content source by default
[08:44:35] <hellyeah> well
[08:44:49] <hellyeah> this is weird to me i didnt expect that
[08:44:59] <hellyeah> but if it worked it works
[10:36:46] <Justice> Not to be frank, but Am I missing something here? http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/25865663/
[10:36:51] <Justice> this one triggers directly.
[10:58:44] <taplar> Justice: it looks like you are invoking two methods
[10:59:17] <taplar> on("click", runFunc(getFunc("var"))); <-- that invokes both getFunc and then runFunc immediately
[11:05:07] <Justice> yup had to nest it into a function() {// code } instead
[11:05:29] <Justice> noticed that you only can use the short way when not providing any vars?
[11:05:52] <taplar> nah, you can reference vars within the scope
[11:06:43] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/er2t1dq9/
[11:08:04] <taplar> or if you want to pass in stuff you can always use bind()
[11:08:50] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[11:11:27] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/er2t1dq9/1/
[11:19:32] <Justice> taplar, but isnt bind depricated in 3.0 ?
[11:19:44] <taplar> bind() is a javascript method, so no
[11:19:53] <Justice> o.O http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/deprecated-3.0/
[11:20:02] <Justice> or is that $.bind ?
[11:20:15] <taplar> ^
[11:20:21] <taplar> $.fn.bind
[11:20:24] <taplar> was deprecated
[11:20:45] <taplar> Function.prototype.bind is not in the pervue of things jQuery can deprecate, :)
[11:22:10] <looker> guys angular or react ?
[11:22:14] <Justice> heh who knows, now that browsers implement what they find is nice.
[11:22:17] <Justice> neather?
[11:22:32] <taplar> huh?
[11:22:38] <taplar> oh
[11:22:53] <taplar> looker: it depends on what you need
[11:23:08] <Justice> isnt VueJS the framework of the week? or is it superseeded by yet another one?
[11:23:17] <taplar> angular is a full MVC framework.  react focuses mainly on the MV part
[11:23:22] <looker> teplar if i need money ?
[11:23:30] <taplar> i like vue, but it's not yet as popular as react
[11:23:37] <Justice> if you need money cobolt or some old crap.
[11:23:46] <looker> lol
[11:24:01] <taplar> that's not a lie. cobol is great for banking
[11:24:05] <Justice> banks will throw money on you just to continue their business.
[11:24:09] <taplar> but you wouldn't run cobol in the browser
[11:24:49] <taplar> our shop is a big cobol shop too
[11:24:50] <looker> im from Poland, in I think in Poland there is more react jobs
[11:24:56] <looker> this is my motive
[11:25:04] <taplar> so there you go
[11:25:06] <Justice> work for CD project =)
[11:25:15] <taplar> CD?

[11:25:31] <looker> "CD project"

[11:25:47] <Justice> people can fly isnt anymore or was it merged with CD ?
[11:26:15] <looker> I was on interview to CD Project, but my English is to weak ;)
[11:27:56] <Justice> arrent you polish ?
[11:28:45] <looker> im Polish but a lot of big companies require very good english skills
[11:29:00] <looker> becouse usually teams are very international
[11:29:28] <Justice> even CD?, though people are mostly polish there.
[11:29:37] <Justice> even people complained that english was weak there
[11:30:03] <looker> on my last job each guy was from other country ;)
[11:30:27] <looker> one guy from Nepal, one from Spain, one from Slovakia, one from Ukraine ;)
[11:30:50] <looker> but I like it that this profession is so international ;)
[11:31:07] <taplar> logic knows no nationality, :)
[11:32:13] <looker> I think also employer wanna be sure that you can read documentation with understanding ;)
[11:33:46] <looker> guys are you from US or Europe? Where are you from?
[11:39:21] <taplar> US
[11:47:12] <looker> programmers in US support democrats or republicans?

[12:25:25] <jak2000> looker and taplar thanks, any advice for create graphs? you use any library?
[13:00:44] <looker> jak2000
[13:00:52] <looker> d3.js ?
[13:01:06] <looker> depends how complicated is your graph
[13:22:29] <jak2000> number days versus no employes by sample...
[14:02:29] <looker> If you dont have any complicated options, use the simplest svg charts
[14:02:31] <looker> maybe https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/ ?
[14:02:51] <looker> don't use too complicated stuff like d3.js
[14:03:00] <looker> jak2000
[14:15:25] <jak2000> OK, THANKS
[14:15:29] <jak2000> sorry for caps
[14:45:17] <definitelynotjq> Using "break" in an .each is the same as a break in a for loop right?
[14:45:23] <definitelynotjq> Just making sure before I screw stuff up :P
[14:46:27] <Cork> no, it isn't
[14:46:35] <Cork> .each is a function call with a callback
[14:46:57] <Cork> so if you want to abort it you return false (if i remember correctly)
[14:47:12] <definitelynotjq> I don't wanna abort
[14:47:21] <definitelynotjq> Wait
[14:47:27] <definitelynotjq> Do I mean "continue" not break?
[14:47:34] <definitelynotjq> To just skip to the next one
[14:49:01] <definitelynotjq> I just wanna skip to the next .each object, not abort the whole .each
[14:49:34] <Cork> lol
[14:49:39] <Cork> definitelynotjq: http://jsfiddle.net/0hh1yc8q/
[14:49:50] <Cork> if you want to skip, just run "return"
[14:50:12] <Cork> definitelynotjq: http://jsfiddle.net/0hh1yc8q/1/
[14:50:49] <definitelynotjq> Cork: Ahhh perfect example in /1/
[14:50:51] <definitelynotjq> Thanks

[17:18:01] <Tcalp> hey guys, I'm doing an autocomplete json/ajax lookup on a form, but the created elements are need to support arrays, but not sure how to alter the JS to satisfy the array handling   , example : https://pastebin.com/quXRFwbJ
[17:19:53] <taplar_lunch> what does the response look like?
[17:20:52] <Tcalp> taplar, that wasn't directed at me was it ?
[17:20:58] <taplar> yep
[17:21:19] <Tcalp> well it works fine as a single element
[17:21:31] <Tcalp> I'm just looking how to use arrays with a single JS
[17:21:45] <taplar> so you're avoiding my question, :P
[17:22:08] <Tcalp> well the response isn't relevant to the question
[17:22:31] <taplar> then what part of this script isn't doing what you want it to?
[17:22:54] <Tcalp> the response is fine and working as expected, I want to put the response into the respective array element
[17:22:58] <taplar> line 12 expects json to be an array
[17:23:12] <taplar> what array element?
[17:23:49] <Tcalp> lets say I have an array of inputs :  product_option[0][autofill_category_id] , product_option[1][autofill_category_id] , product_option[2][autofill_category_id]
[17:24:03] <taplar> an array of objects, sure
[17:24:07] <Tcalp> with equally : apath[0] 1 2 .. etc
[17:24:16] <taplar> what?
[17:24:32] <taplar> apath being another array of equal length?
[17:24:50] <Tcalp> yes an array of equal lenth
[17:24:52] <taplar> k
[17:24:57] <Tcalp> apath is what you type the query into
[17:25:08] <Tcalp> autofill_category_id stores the value result
[17:25:41] <Tcalp> but given the callback function , I'm not sure how to make the JS fill the right box
[17:26:23] <taplar> so the json array items have a key of category_id.  does that relate to an autofill_category_id?
[17:27:14] <Tcalp> one would relate to the other, yes.
[17:27:24] <Tcalp> in that the autofill is a category_id
[17:27:30] <taplar> is the autofill_category_id repeated in any product option?
[17:27:53] <Tcalp> in every product option
[17:27:59] <taplar> no no, the value
[17:28:04] <Tcalp> which is where I'm trying to sort out the JS
[17:28:47] <taplar> so if product_option[0].autofill_category_id === 747.  could 747 also be in another one of the elements autofill_category_id?
[17:29:15] <Tcalp> I don't see how the value assignment makes a difference to the problem
[17:29:23] <taplar> i'm asking if the values are unique
[17:29:45] <taplar> it effects if you have to find the single one to set, or the multiple ones to set
[17:30:36] <Tcalp> I'm only ever finding one value to set, but that is based upon the product_option index
[17:30:40] <Tcalp> the value can be anything
[17:30:46] <taplar> but are they unique
[17:30:52] <Tcalp> no
[17:31:44] <Tcalp> product_option[0].autofill_category_id / product_option[1].autofill_category_id / product_option[2].autofill_category_id , could all have the same value
[17:31:53] <taplar> k
[17:32:03] <Tcalp> I need the JS to know what the array index is
[17:32:17] <Tcalp> I tried : http://puu.sh/yczZd/5ba7bb1125.png
[17:32:27] <taplar> and you are wanting to put something from the json result on those product_options, yes?
[17:32:33] <Tcalp> where I store the index into data-row
[17:32:53] <Tcalp> but it doesn't seem to accept the additional index
[17:33:01] <Tcalp> in that the alert is undefined
[17:34:42] <taplar> what do you get if you console log just the ui.item
[17:35:37] <Tcalp> {label: "Warmers", value: "167"}
[17:36:07] <taplar> ok, go back to your ajax response
[17:36:18] <taplar> what is an 'item'?
[17:37:04] <Tcalp> it's the json response
[17:37:22] <taplar> but what is it?  html?  json? what?
[17:37:33] <Tcalp> response($.map(json, function(item) {
[17:37:37] <Tcalp> it's mapping the json array to item
[17:37:49] <taplar> cause $(this).attr('data-row') only works on html
[17:38:04] <taplar> or an existing element
[17:38:38] <taplar> *dom element
[17:39:05] <Tcalp> right
[17:39:10] <taplar> so what is 'item'?
[17:39:15] <taplar> is it one of those two things?
[17:39:29] <Tcalp> json is an array of elements
[17:39:33] <taplar> not json
[17:39:36] <Tcalp> that have name and category id
[17:39:37] <taplar> the item itself
[17:39:41] <Tcalp> it is being mapped to item
[17:39:43] <Tcalp> for each element
[17:39:50] <taplar> right, and item is something
[17:39:58] <taplar> a string, a number, boolean, something
[17:40:05] <Tcalp> item is each json array element
[17:40:13] <taplar> and what is the element
[17:40:36] <taplar> is it an html string?
[17:40:50] <Tcalp> it's a name and category_id ?
[17:41:20] <taplar> so that's not valid for the row part
[17:41:34] <Tcalp> which is the question
[17:41:47] <taplar> is row on the item?
[17:41:50] <Tcalp> how do I know the index of the row item
[17:42:07] <taplar> or should the row be related to the position of the item in the json?
[17:42:20] <Tcalp> I want the row to be the index of product_option
[17:42:24] <Tcalp> that is being typed into
[17:42:30] <taplar> ok
[17:42:33] <taplar> wait
[17:42:40] <Tcalp> so if I'm typing into   product_option[0][apath]  I want row to be 0
[17:43:17] <taplar> ok, so you are really after a reference to the element typed into, is your issue
[17:43:32] <Tcalp> yes
[17:43:56] <taplar> ok, try this.  https://pastebin.com/quXRFwbJ  on line 8 before the ajax, put a console.log(this) and see what you get
[17:44:15] <Tcalp> no longer available
[17:44:27] <taplar> ?
[17:44:32] <Tcalp> the pastbin plink
[17:44:33] <Tcalp> link*
[17:44:56] <taplar> ok, well inside the source method, before the ajax, try to console log the 'this'
[17:48:50] <Tcalp> sorry my puush seems to be down
[17:51:10] <Tcalp> but it is returning showing .  b.(annonymous function).(anonymous function) {element: init(1), options: {...}, menu: b.(...).(anonymous function), source: f, response: f, ...}
[17:51:30] <taplar> egh
[17:51:40] <taplar> well that's less than helpful
[17:55:17] <Tcalp> ahh
[17:55:20] <Tcalp> I think I've got it
[17:56:04] <Tcalp> $(this) is defined properly within the select
[17:57:55] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/os7nLbp9/
[17:58:02] <taplar> you can also get the element off the event passed in
[18:00:40] <Tcalp> yeah I got it working
[18:18:12] <NitroLiq> Anyone know how I can get a  relatively-positioned parent container to re-size according to its absolutely-positioned contents?
[18:19:46] <NitroLiq> Essentially, I have a responsive  parallax slider (hero section) sandwiched between two sections but as the slider resizes it causes a gap within the container
[18:20:12] <NitroLiq> I've already gone through all the css options but no go.
[18:20:47] <Tcalp> taplar , thanks very much for your help though
[18:21:29] <NitroLiq> For example, https://codepen.io/anon/pen/JOYpdm
[18:22:09] <NitroLiq> trying to get the footer to always follow the resizing of the container/images before it
