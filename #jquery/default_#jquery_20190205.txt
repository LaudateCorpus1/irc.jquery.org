[02:00:51] <CuirPork> when  assigning a css property like clip-path using jquery, how do I encode the text? var class={clip-path(0%,0% 100%,0% 100%,100% 0%,100%)} doesn't work-where do I put quotes?
[02:02:36] <robertmaxrees> normally it's clip-path: shape(blah blah)
[02:03:00] <robertmaxrees> so what's the shape you want?
[02:03:49] <CuirPork> just trying to animate a clip path that lets the text slide down from beneath something (but that something is transparent)
[02:04:19] <robertmaxrees> so how would you write it using normal css?
[02:04:21] <robertmaxrees> outside of jquery.
[02:04:35] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to use ploygon?
[02:04:55] <CuirPork> without quotes and with semi-colons between properties instead of commas
[02:05:04] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i'm asking.
[02:05:07] <robertmaxrees> show mne the original css.
[02:05:17] <CuirPork> one sec.
[02:08:20] <CuirPork> it's a real mess cause I have been trying everything. Here is the pen, but I am in the middle of ditching css animations at this point. https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/MLvvQj
[02:08:45] <robertmaxrees> so clip-path: polygon(0% 0%, 100% 0%, 100% 0%, 0% 0%); ?
[02:08:46] <CuirPork> that's why I was trying to figure out how "clip-path" gets written in javascript object terms.
[02:08:57] <robertmaxrees> it's not in "javascript object terms" fwiw.
[02:09:04] <CuirPork> in js
[02:09:08] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[02:09:13] <robertmaxrees> you mean when passing to .css() ?
[02:09:18] <CuirPork> $("elem").css(object goes here, right)
[02:09:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:09:31] <robertmaxrees> so you're conlfating 2 concepts.
[02:09:36] <CuirPork> precisely
[02:09:55] <robertmaxrees> there's passing an object to .css(), or property name, property value.
[02:10:06] <CuirPork> which doesn't take % well
[02:10:15] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[02:10:22] <robertmaxrees> js strings take % just fine.
[02:10:24] <robertmaxrees> so .css('clip-path', 'polygon(0% 0%, 100% 0%, 100% 0%, 0% 0%)');
[02:10:37] <robertmaxrees> or .css({'clip-path': 'polygon(0% 0%, 100% 0%, 100% 0%, 0% 0%)'})
[02:10:55] <CuirPork> so you put quotes around the whole thing! thank you.
[02:11:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[02:11:02] <robertmaxrees> it's strings.
[02:11:14] <robertmaxrees> keep in mind, however, that jquery and keyframes don't get along.
[02:11:17] <CuirPork> I tried "0%","100%"  to evey combination except of course that one
[02:11:29] <robertmaxrees> and i'd question why you're setting any of this using jquery tbh
[02:11:37] <CuirPork> I am starting to think nothing works well with keyframes...or at least I don't
[02:11:47] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[02:11:50] <robertmaxrees> just use css?
[02:11:59] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to do this with jquery in the first place?
[02:12:09] <CuirPork> I tried that for the last 4 hours. Doing something I could have done in jquery in 5 minutes
[02:12:18] <robertmaxrees> heh
[02:12:41] <CuirPork> I thought the keyframes thing would be cool to be able to reverse the animations..
[02:12:46] <robertmaxrees> which is fine.
[02:12:50] <robertmaxrees> do that via css.
[02:12:58] <robertmaxrees> and have jquery add/remove classes as necessary.
[02:13:23] <CuirPork> If you look at the mess of jquery I started, that's how I had it setup for the first severalhours.
[02:13:32] <robertmaxrees> i didn't look at your js.
[02:13:32] <robertmaxrees> hjeh
[02:13:55] <CuirPork> I'd add an init class (that would run the animnation forwards) then an exit class that would reverse it using the same keyframes
[02:14:08] <robertmaxrees> looking at your codepen again - you don't do anything "in jquery" fwiw.
[02:14:17] <CuirPork> then I decided to just use jquery for all of it.
[02:14:43] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that heh.
[02:14:44] <robertmaxrees> but alright.
[02:15:44] <CuirPork> I'll keep working on the keyframes thing, but it just doesn't seem like it's that great. Maybe I'll have breakthrough. Thanks for your advice
[02:16:07] <robertmaxrees> the thing is: css is awesome.  just gotta take a little to learn it.
[02:16:21] <robertmaxrees> reimplementing css solutions through js leads to bigger headaches
[02:27:27] <CuirPork> maybe I just need to skip the animation keyframes and use an easing function and transitions.
[02:27:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[02:38:17] <undefined_bob> shoky: thanks :)
[03:06:10] <CuirPork> I just got the strangest, smart-ass error from npm while using codepen...
[03:07:02] <robertmaxrees> ?
[03:07:09] <CuirPork>   ðŸ•‘ One or more of the npm packages you are using needs to be built. You're the first person to ever need it! We're building it right now and your preview will start updating again when it's ready.
[03:07:41] <undefined_bob> lol what are you using?
[03:07:42] <robertmaxrees> that's... not being smart-ass fwiw.
[03:07:52] <CuirPork> I'm the first person, really?
[03:08:19] <CuirPork> ever?
[03:08:54] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like codepen, not npm
[03:09:03] <robertmaxrees> npm doesn't build projects
[03:09:44] <CuirPork> sorry, I didn't mean to imply anything negative about npm, or codepen for that matter, I thought it was funny
[03:10:12] <robertmaxrees> just clarifying.
[03:10:16] <robertmaxrees> not an NPM thing.
[03:23:34] <undefined_bob> it is indeed a bit funny, I haven't heard that message before
[04:34:17] <CuirPork> do I have to use setTimeout to remove a css class after it transitions? or is there a way to trigger an event when the css-transition is complete?
[04:36:58] <bestdesign> setTimeout
[04:37:08] <CuirPork> thank you
[04:37:26] <bestdesign> or you can use
[04:37:30] <bestdesign> callback
[04:37:48] <CuirPork> on addClass()?
[04:38:31] <bestdesign> $("#hideshow").click(function(){           $("tr:even").toggleclass("red");        });
[04:39:07] <bestdesign> is remove and add
[04:40:09] <CuirPork> I have separated the animation classes from the element styling classes. I add .anim to allow an aninmated transition, or leave it out to just swap properties.
[04:40:26] <CuirPork> after the animated transition, I need to remove the animn class.
[04:40:36] <CuirPork> https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/MLvvQj
[04:41:48] <CuirPork> if I don't remove the anim class, resizing is hilarious because of the easing formula I am using.
[04:42:03] <bestdesign> then use setTimeout with animation same time
[04:42:54] <bestdesign> after animation time is end
[04:44:21] <CuirPork> wow, removing the anim class kind of works, but on resize, the animation-delay property is still in effect, so things have strange delays when resizing.
[04:46:01] <bestdesign> well sorry i am not pro but on resize do something reset class
[04:46:52] <bestdesign> when do resize then add a class to stop?
[04:50:00] <bestdesign> CuirPork wait robert contain nickname
[04:50:04] <bestdesign> he is a pro ...
[04:56:26] <bestdesign> CuirPork or add more class in a chain :)
[05:05:51] <CuirPork> Here's the deal. I have given it my best with all of these stupid css classes to do what I could do with .animate in half an hour. What a ridiculous hangup to be more worried about what other people think if I don't use the latest css tricks to animate my text.
[05:06:40] <bestdesign> :)
[09:22:31] <CuirPork> there are sooo many bad answers on stack overflow, I am just shocked every time I go there.
[09:44:08] <Cork> CuirPork: ya, especially if you search for answers about javascript, and even more for jquery
[09:49:19] <pavonia> Possibly because that site is too active. The first few people who see the question on the main page answer, and then the question vanishes
[10:16:20] <Wouter_> Hey guys. I got a small problem. I was using tampermonkey to loop over some elements in a website. I then got an HTMLcollection object(with a get elementsbyclassname) which I then loop over with a let item of list for loop.My problem occured when the object I was interested in changed when I was at that element. Does anyone know how that is possible?
[10:16:48] <Wouter_> The element I am interested in is a input element which is a button
[10:17:00] <Wouter_> It is disabled btw
[10:54:50] <bestdesign> how to get cauclate with jquery that
[10:55:03] <bestdesign> when zoom out page -200%
[10:55:20] <bestdesign> and do a CTRL + 0
[10:55:31] <bestdesign> calculate*
[10:56:42] <bestdesign> is not work with .resize
[11:33:45] <bestdesign> hi
[12:56:06] <bestdesign> hey all
[12:56:15] <robertmaxrees> hello
[12:56:49] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees can i write u a line?
[12:57:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:57:14] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, just post it out to the channel.
[12:57:32] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/jxom8vpb/1/ question is in fiddle
[12:57:54] <robertmaxrees> it's also helpful if you ask the question here, too :)
[12:58:34] <bestdesign> I try to understand how can make from non button state with width: 0; css to not break navigation items....
[12:59:07] <bestdesign> is calculate always the menus width but the menu is not and this way the text is flow up
[12:59:34] <robertmaxrees> i can't understand your question.,
[13:01:37] <bestdesign> when MENU is hidden and resize window closer and got the links that not include MENU width so that breaks the menu untill resize a bit with mouse
[13:03:00] <bestdesign> how can get always actually size? for links and for MENU?
[13:03:18] <bestdesign> as its not include in links width the MENU
[13:03:40] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so where in the code is this breaking?>
[13:04:43] <bestdesign> have TEST text next to it navbar the N is not visible
[13:04:48] <robertmaxrees> also: this is strange behavior.  why not just use a regular mobile menu?
[13:04:53] <bestdesign> if resize that way from non menu to menu state
[13:05:28] <robertmaxrees> okay back up - how do I replicate your bug?
[13:06:09] <bestdesign> i make a photo
[13:06:29] <robertmaxrees> why not just... describe the actions i'd have to take?
[13:07:19] <bestdesign> make full width the MENU goes hidden
[13:07:29] <robertmaxrees> k
[13:07:47] <bestdesign> and then resize to half of it and some text is not visible as not calculate right
[13:08:17] <robertmaxrees> k
[13:08:42] <robertmaxrees> seems to be working fine so far.
[13:08:43] <bestdesign> i just post img
[13:09:54] <bestdesign> https://imgur.com/a/Bcu4Fph
[13:10:05] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?
[13:10:09] <bestdesign> is more often do when not resize
[13:10:11] <bestdesign> chrome latest
[13:10:28] <robertmaxrees> i can't replicate that bug
[13:10:29] <bestdesign> so clip the text half or bit
[13:10:36] <bestdesign> after resize a bit is calculate right
[13:10:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not breaking for me.
[13:11:04] <bestdesign> i see is because from MENU not display state to Display that not calculate menu WIDTH
[13:11:21] <bestdesign> :(
[13:11:25] <robertmaxrees> why are YOU randomly CAPPING certain WORDS?
[13:11:36] <bestdesign> oh sorry
[13:11:38] <bestdesign> caps lock
[13:12:07] <robertmaxrees> so backing way up
[13:12:08] <bestdesign> os actually do this effect when not resize the screen
[13:12:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:12:16] <bestdesign> just click minimalize from maximalize
[13:12:32] <bestdesign> that icon before close x
[13:12:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:13:02] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean restore
[13:13:04] <bestdesign> full screen icon every window and x to close
[13:13:12] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:13:22] <robertmaxrees> so back WAAAAAAAY up.
[13:13:54] <robertmaxrees> what you're asking is why the menu isn't firing the resize when the window is restored from being maximized.
[13:14:14] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/oQ04Hpk.png right?
[13:14:45] <bestdesign> yes!
[13:15:15] <bestdesign> https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/silverlight/controls/radwindow/features/images/RadWindow_Minimize_Maximize_01.png
[13:15:21] <bestdesign> these icons :)
[13:15:39] <bestdesign> so is not with resize... function
[13:15:49] <robertmaxrees> returning a window from maximized to it's "regular" status is called "restore" ;)
[13:16:01] <bestdesign> ah sorry now know what is it
[13:16:08] <robertmaxrees> and backing WAAAAY up.
[13:16:17] <bestdesign> yes that is my problem when do that always breaks the width...
[13:16:24] <robertmaxrees> why are you building a menu like this in the first place?  why not to the normal mobile menu?
[13:17:04] <bestdesign> i try to make up a top left right and bottom layout
[13:17:10] <bestdesign> i know menu is not middle but...
[13:17:23] <bestdesign> i do that with animation to fade in there
[13:17:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:17:32] <robertmaxrees> that's not answering my question.
[13:17:37] <bestdesign> Is one button navigation for top
[13:17:50] <bestdesign> because layout
[13:17:57] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense lol
[13:18:19] <bestdesign> yes but i like this more than bootstrap :(
[13:18:32] <bestdesign> i try different ways
[13:18:33] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap has nothing to do with my question.
[13:18:52] <bestdesign> boostrap js navigation default
[13:18:59] <bestdesign> bootstrap*
[13:19:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:19:36] <bestdesign> So i try to make this as navigation only about 30 lines of code
[13:20:00] <bestdesign> I know is not that easy... I just not want use prebuilt one
[13:20:02] <robertmaxrees> okay?  why do lines of code matter?
[13:20:06] <robertmaxrees> and why not?
[13:20:27] <bestdesign> If i use any framework with that have navigation
[13:20:30] <bestdesign> I try make my own
[13:20:39] <bestdesign> with jQuery
[13:20:40] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:21:25] <bestdesign> well its because i try to make something different
[13:21:32] <robertmaxrees> why though?
[13:21:47] <robertmaxrees> bucking conventions is generally a bad idea.
[13:22:14] <bestdesign> I try to get out from general website menu title
[13:22:28] <robertmaxrees> end users have expectations.  not following those expectations can have detrimental effects on their experience.
[13:22:46] <robertmaxrees> forcing them to learn your new paradigm is counter-productive
[13:23:44] <bestdesign> is same like bootstrap just not break in 600px for navigation...
[13:23:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not the same lol
[13:23:53] <bestdesign> if there have spaces then do if not not
[13:24:11] <bestdesign> i mean the dropdown
[13:24:17] <robertmaxrees> your new menu is confusing.
[13:24:23] <robertmaxrees> you're showing some menu items while hiding others.
[13:24:29] <robertmaxrees> which doesn't really make sense.
[13:24:40] <bestdesign> yes show what is have space and hide for what is not have space
[13:24:56] <bestdesign> only display what is have place on screen width
[13:25:08] <bestdesign> if not stay dropdown
[13:25:12] <robertmaxrees> let me rephrase - just becuase something makes sense to you does not mean it makes sense to your end users.
[13:25:23] <robertmaxrees> randomly hiding some navigation items behind a button is confusing.
[13:25:43] <bestdesign> randomly?
[13:25:47] <bestdesign> is by screen size
[13:25:50] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[13:25:54] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[13:26:07] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[13:28:35] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/examples/navbar/#
[13:28:41] <bestdesign> resize is also hide
[13:28:53] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> they show/hide the entire menu.
[13:29:02] <bestdesign> just at an exact width with @media
[13:29:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[13:29:14] <robertmaxrees> that's how you should do it,.
[13:29:20] <bestdesign> entire yes mine not
[13:29:24] <robertmaxrees> right./
[13:29:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that you want to do all or none.
[13:29:52] <robertmaxrees> randomly hiding certain nav items the way you are doesn't really make sense from a UX perspective.
[13:30:00] <robertmaxrees> you may not think it's random, but it is.
[13:30:38] <bestdesign> understand
[13:33:34] <bestdesign> to do all I not know how...
[13:33:44] <robertmaxrees> you said you're using bootstrap, right?
[13:34:35] <bestdesign> i try to not use something own but not works well
[13:34:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:35:06] <bestdesign> bootstrap is so generic
[13:35:33] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:35:37] <bestdesign> just want a simple nav
[13:35:45] <bestdesign> without it
[13:35:45] <robertmaxrees> you realize you can customize bootstrap, right?
[13:36:03] <robertmaxrees> and okay - then just use media queries to style your nav the right way for different breakpoints.
[13:37:15] <bestdesign> ok
[13:43:32] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees is also weird then you about cover page navigations as they do nothing just display in a whole page not at break points what you think?
[13:43:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:44:09] <bestdesign> click on button and display navigation full screen on every screen?
[13:44:15] <bestdesign> device*
[13:44:28] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that for desktop personally.
[13:44:41] <robertmaxrees> that's relatively common on mobile.
[13:45:28] <bestdesign> hmm i try figure out simplest as i can
[13:45:45] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you want the benefits of responsive without putting in any of the work lol
[13:47:01] <bestdesign> you are right ahah
[13:47:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:47:31] <bestdesign> i hate @media set for every screen size about navigation...
[13:47:48] <robertmaxrees> that's why people use libraries and frameworks to manage it.
[13:47:55] <bestdesign> is there about two option show or not
[13:48:02] <robertmaxrees> you know you can theme boostrap, right?
[13:48:10] <bestdesign> not about largest and notebook and tablet and mobile
[13:48:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:48:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:48:43] <bestdesign> navigation must work more on mobile and notebok
[13:48:57] <bestdesign> on largest cant change much
[13:49:02] <bestdesign> and tablet
[13:49:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:49:16] <bestdesign> that state when still display show or/hide
[13:49:44] <robertmaxrees> gotta give up that NIH
[13:49:51] <bestdesign> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/examples/navbar-fixed-top/#about if you see this is only works on mobile on large sizes same
[13:50:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:50:10] <bestdesign> up to 800px
[13:50:16] <bestdesign> is same no change
[13:50:21] <robertmaxrees> you mean for the max width?
[13:50:25] <robertmaxrees> or..?
[13:50:29] <bestdesign> yes widht of window
[13:50:38] <robertmaxrees> it goes wider.
[13:50:38] <bestdesign> on under 600px got dropdown
[13:50:55] <robertmaxrees> and you can customize those breakpoints.
[13:51:36] <bestdesign> yes but what to do? i mean is something like toggleclass show or hide the nav what customize on it more?
[13:51:57] <bestdesign> :o
[13:51:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:52:08] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn what design actually works for your case.
[13:52:36] <bestdesign> yeah
[13:52:45] <bestdesign> i just hate frameworks
[13:52:48] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:55:32] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-freelancer/ I not want be the same like this
[13:55:46] <robertmaxrees> then don't?
[13:55:54] <robertmaxrees> you can theme bootstrap so it looks different.
[13:56:42] <bestdesign> is like scrollspy or not do the same all the way
[13:56:57] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:57:02] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing things
[13:57:32] <bestdesign> see above nav :)
[13:57:35] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap has a decent grid system and mobile-first design pattern.
[13:57:50] <robertmaxrees> as well as some plugins and things to flesh it out more.
[13:57:55] <bestdesign> is fine but components make it generic
[13:58:03] <bestdesign> is same on every website that use it
[13:58:03] <robertmaxrees> they don't.
[13:58:12] <robertmaxrees> you just need to learn how to theme bootstrap.
[13:59:26] <bestdesign> yes this way i grab one from themeforest and i need edit text and im finish
[14:00:46] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:00:52] <bestdesign> bootstrap is something like a border-radous: 50%; is same on every website
[14:00:58] <bestdesign> radius*
[14:01:00] <robertmaxrees> right so
[14:01:04] <bestdesign> about components
[14:01:04] <robertmaxrees> you can theme it so it doesn't do that.
[14:01:23] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees you know tool for theme?
[14:01:28] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what I mean when I say "you can theme bootstrap"?
[14:01:34] <robertmaxrees> you override its vars yourself.
[14:01:35] <bestdesign> yes
[14:01:39] <bestdesign> change color etc
[14:01:45] <robertmaxrees> yes.,
[14:01:53] <robertmaxrees> that include borders, radii, etc.
[22:07:37] <lurkashflake> $('.class').each(function(){alert(this.position().top);});  > this.position is not a function. Why?
[22:07:50] <lurkashflake> Can I pass this variable through the function parentese?
[22:08:26] <pavonia> You want $(this), I guess
[22:08:39] <lurkashflake> oh, what is "this" refering too then?
[22:08:44] <lurkashflake> to*
[22:09:05] <pavonia> The DOM element, IIRC
[22:09:15] <lurkashflake> great!
[22:11:29] <lurkashflake> All element get triggered simultaneously. How may I affect each element individualy?
[22:12:43] <pavonia> What do you mean?
[22:14:21] <lurkashflake> there is 20 card displayed vertically $('.card').each(function(){ if( $(this).position is in view ){ $(this).getBigger() } }; at the moment one get in the view, they all trigger together even those who weren't in the window
[22:17:45] <lurkashflake> But I want each element to be independant and get bigger when they individualy get in view
[22:18:55] <lurkashflake> does my problem make sense? maybe it's a bootstrap bug...
[22:19:08] <pavonia> It should only affect the current element that is in view, unless your check is wrong somehow
[22:19:36] <lurkashflake> ah
[22:21:42] * lurkashflake solved
