[00:26:38] <devi8> to setup custom validity messages for html5 form validation do you have to use the setCustomValidity() method on each element or is there a way to set it for all input[type='tel'] elements?
[00:55:05] <robertmaxrees> you can select all the elements and call that method against each one.
[00:55:31] <robertmaxrees> if you've got jquery, you'd just use .each() with that selector you've got.
[01:35:14] <senaps> can i use $().css() to add css classes to the page or is it just to edit the existing? im trying to add a css class to the page, it seems the objects don't get the code im passing them too.(the class isn't present in the css, so i am creating it, not editing.)
[01:38:58] <robertmaxrees> senaps you mean add a block of css itself?
[01:39:03] <robertmaxrees> or add a class to an element?
[01:40:22] <robertmaxrees> senaps ^
[01:40:51] <senaps> it should be adding a block.
[01:40:56] <senaps> let me paste the code
[01:41:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, can't really do that.
[01:41:10] <robertmaxrees> .css() is meant to edit existing css.
[01:42:17] <robertmaxrees> but let's reframe this - why do you want to do that?
[01:42:19] <Woet> or add css to an element
[01:42:21] <devi8> robertmaxrees, thanks for your help again. I was hoping to find a way to setup the validation message so that new input[type='tel'] elements would also have the right validation msg. No biggy. Thanks again.
[01:42:26] <senaps> huh, so i should add class? https://jsfiddle.net/q0988pxy/
[01:42:47] <robertmaxrees> devi8 ah, yeah gotta call it on new elements.
[01:43:11] <robertmaxrees> senaps i'm super lost now hahaha
[01:43:15] * Woet blinks
[01:43:30] <robertmaxrees> senaps are you trying to add multiple rules to an element or...?
[01:43:40] <Woet> senaps: you cannot add CSS like ".amcharts-map-line {", you can only do things like "stroke: green;"
[01:43:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[01:44:05] <senaps> Woet how would i add that? addclass does that?
[01:44:17] <robertmaxrees> senaps are you trying to add a class to an element?
[01:44:33] <Woet> senaps: no, you just don't. it should be in your CSS already.
[01:44:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[01:44:47] <senaps> robertmaxrees yup. but, i don't know if that element exists or not!
[01:44:54] <robertmaxrees> senaps yeah, no.
[01:44:59] <robertmaxrees> add the css to your stylesheet.
[01:45:09] <robertmaxrees> don't generate blocks of css using js.
[01:45:09] <Woet> you can add CSS for non-existent elements
[01:45:31] <robertmaxrees> you just don't generate css rules using js.
[01:45:33] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[01:45:54] <senaps> robertmaxrees this is some dynamic thing! items aren't there! i add them on the fly, and i can't hardcode it! i have multiple elements being added or removed!
[01:46:01] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[01:46:12] <robertmaxrees> okay back waaaay up.
[01:46:16] <senaps> so, i have to add them to the css file and then just edit them when needed right?
[01:46:19] <robertmaxrees> so you're adding and removing elements?
[01:46:23] <robertmaxrees> right?
[01:46:38] <senaps> yup.
[01:46:42] <robertmaxrees> and you want the css to apply to all newly created elements?
[01:47:31] <senaps> yes... they are different kinds on elements. being added to the page, so i need to be dynamic on their color! and other properties.
[01:47:38] <robertmaxrees> right.
[01:48:11] <robertmaxrees> so you define classes in your css and then use those classes when you append the elements.
[01:49:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ttkzoryz/1/
[01:49:21] <robertmaxrees> css will apply to any and all elements you create.
[01:49:45] <senaps> then if i add a new type of element, i have to go on and add it to css file too. i don't like it! but seems that this is the only way arount. thought i think it shouldn't bee.
[01:50:02] <robertmaxrees> why don't you like it?
[01:50:07] <robertmaxrees> that's what CSS is for.
[01:50:12] <Woet> lol
[01:50:21] <robertmaxrees> like, that's literally its job.
[01:50:34] <Woet> pretty much it's only job
[01:50:36] <robertmaxrees> ^
[01:50:44] <robertmaxrees> that's why it was invented.
[01:50:59] <robertmaxrees> to store styles for elements.
[01:52:30] <senaps> no, i know what its doing! :)  i don't like how i need to edit multiple files to add a new element! if someone writes a plugin(element) on my app, they have to edit multiple places, while i have been writing a lot of code to allow them do it more easily! :)  i will go with this solution but still test some code to see if i can hack around!
[01:52:46] <robertmaxrees> erm
[01:53:01] <robertmaxrees> don't hack around it.
[01:53:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not easier.
[01:53:51] <robertmaxrees> since it's less intuitive.
[01:59:42] <senaps> okay , le tme try another bad solution, can't i append a string like "<style: stroke: color />" to the element? i do it on page load, if exists, it gets the style and if not, im not doing the code for it anyway! :)
[01:59:59] <robertmaxrees> that won't work in all browsers.
[02:00:11] <robertmaxrees> and is a really, really bad idea anyway.
[02:01:15] <robertmaxrees> why are you so dead-set on something that goes against developer expectations?
[02:03:12] <senaps> so im counting the elements being added to the page, showing the count with the same color, and showing the chart's help desk so people can know what color is representing what element, and .... i have four-five palces that should show information with the same color and styles of added element. it's a lot of hardcoding .
[02:03:29] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[02:03:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:04:46] <robertmaxrees> so first off: tools like scss exist.
[02:04:52] <robertmaxrees> second off: that's not really that much hardcoding.,
[02:06:43] <senaps> heck! :)  i thought i have done this before, did a lot of coding assuming this is what i have done and so, just have to go back to what it was before! :)  kinda disappointed!
[02:07:03] <senaps> thanks man... i will go with hardcoding! enough time spend on this.
[02:45:38] <senaps> i have a list of 2000 objects, i loop through them and do some stuff with them, then render them one by one. the problem is, somehow jquery is managing to render them all in the same time, does everything i want to do the problem is just it takes 3-4 seconds to loop through the whole thing, and then render them.
[02:48:56] <Woet> whats the difference between "one by one" and "all in the same time"?
[02:50:12] <senaps> https://jsfiddle.net/L23jd731/  this is the code, will part of it, hope it makes sense......
[02:50:26] <robertmaxrees> so you want to delay rendering each one?
[02:51:28] <senaps> no, i want to stop js from blocking my browser, while this functions is being ran on each element, page is irresponsive, i can't do anything untill every element is rendered and done, then i have browser(untill next bunch of data comes in!)
[02:52:11] <senaps> where is my code is blocking? will everything takes time, but js is asyinc right?
[02:56:07] <senaps> obviously i wasn't able to describe the question!
[03:07:10] <robertmaxrees> lol this guy
[06:53:03] <devi8> does click bubble up if you trigger it programmatically?
[07:06:17] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to test
[07:06:47] <devi8> That's what I thought about half an hour ago. I finally gave up and just redid everything.
[07:06:54] <robertmaxrees> one sec
[07:07:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dqo0vum5/
[07:07:21] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[07:07:31] <robertmaxrees> also: avoid using .trigger() just to call functions.
[07:07:36] <robertmaxrees> just call the function directly.
[07:08:18] <devi8> I have a series of radio buttons with a "custom" option that I want to replace all of the radio buttons with a text field...
[07:08:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[07:08:38] <devi8> but when  the text field loses focus, if its blank, I want to reset the last clicked radio button
[07:11:47] <robertmaxrees> the "last clicked" or a particular radio?
[07:14:21] <devi8> I'm sorry for the delayed response. I can show you in a codepen in just a second...thanks for your help
[07:18:41] <robertmaxrees> ...
[07:18:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[07:27:54] <devi8> Did something wrong trying to make a test case. Sorry to waste your time.
[07:29:40] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[07:29:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[07:50:59] <devi8> codepen needs a "refresh" button something terrible
[07:54:23] <devi8> This is terribly rough, but it shows what I was trying to do basically. https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/GyGBdK?editors=1111
[11:24:37] <devi8> a little better, but still a mess: https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/wpXEde?editors=1111
[11:29:35] <boor> Hello, how can I pass an if statement for a radio button checkbox for multiple values
[11:30:24] <boor> for example, if radio values are dog, cat, rabbit, what if I want to validate something for both dog and cat
[11:31:19] <boor> ok nvm
[11:31:27] <boor> boor will try
[11:32:20] <devi8> boor, you listen for the cfhange event and validate based on it, maybe?
[11:34:02] <boor> devi8, it's ok i figured, i posted the wrong question even, duh me

[18:44:01] <Onepamopa> guys, how do I make my script catch the selected value of a select box? I can catch the change with $("#tasktypeinput").on("change", function() { alert("ASD"); if ($("#tasktypeinput").val() == "1") { //doesn't work } }
[18:44:12] <Onepamopa> the values of that select box are 1/2/3/4 etc
[19:01:16] <Trashlord> Onepamopa: try .value, not .val()
[19:05:00] <Onepamopa> Trashlord, same... doesn't work
[19:05:17] <Onepamopa> tried $("#selector option:selected").value as well - same
[19:08:20] <Trashlord> don't know then
[19:08:34] <Onepamopa> shows the value as "undefined"
[19:11:54] <Trashlord> what if you try this.value? that's from googling
[20:48:55] <devi8> Onepamopa, can you create a fiddle or codepen so we can see the problem in action?
[20:49:18] <Onepamopa> devi8, already solved
[20:49:29] <Onepamopa> there was a nearly invisible typo ..
