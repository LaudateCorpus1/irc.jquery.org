[00:00:59] <PeraPeric> i'm using twitter typeahead.js with multiple datasets. how can I get name of the dataset on select event?
[00:18:02] <flobin> is it possible to do something like this? $($(this).attr('id’)).addClass(“active”) ?
[00:18:15] <Cork> uh
[00:18:22] <Cork> $(this).addClasS('active') ?
[00:18:31] <Cork> you already have the element, why select it by id?
[00:18:42] <flobin> right, what I put makes no sense
[00:19:07] <flobin> I think I actually know what I want to do
[00:19:24] <flobin> what I’m trying to do is select the id of the current element, in a function
[00:19:36] <flobin> then use that id to select an element in a menu and add a class
[00:19:50] <Cork> you can't use the id for that
[00:19:53] <Cork> ids are unique
[00:20:07] <flobin> oh yeah good point
[00:20:18] <Cork> i would recommend something like $('#' + $(this).data('menu')).addClass('active')
[00:20:32] <flobin> well they’re anchor links, so the id of the element matches the href of the menu link
[00:20:46] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/gtfpa4oq/ why aren't I getting anything when I check jquery mobile?
[00:21:44] <Cork> flobin: so $('#menu').find('a[href="' + this.id + '"]').addClass('active')
[00:22:09] <flobin> ah, that’s much more elegant than what I had, which is
[00:22:38] <flobin> so I was thinking var current = $(this).attr('id’); $($('a[href=‘ + current + ‘]’).addClass(‘active’)
[00:22:52] <flobin> er, without the duplicate $(
[00:22:59] <flobin> but awesome, thank you very much
[00:23:23] <Cork> kinda pointless to use $(this).attr() as you can get the same value directly from this.id
[00:24:12] <flobin> thanks, Cork!
[00:24:16] <Cork> np
[00:26:49] <flobin> Cork: does it make sense to put this before it? $('.menu').find('a[href!="' + this.id + '"]').removeClass('active');
[00:27:12] <Cork> flobin: not in that way
[00:27:52] <flobin> hm, why not?
[00:28:02] <Cork> var menus = $('#menu').find('a').removeClass('active'); menus.filter('[href="' + this.id '"]').addClass('active');
[00:28:09] <Cork> flobin: cause it is wasteful
[00:28:25] <flobin> oh right, easier to just select everything
[00:28:40] <Cork> actually
[00:28:53] <flobin> maybe just $(‘.menu a’).removeClass(‘active’); then
[00:29:28] <flobin> or rather var menulink = $(‘.menu a’); right
[00:30:01] <Cork> flobin: this is prob even more efficient $('#menu').find('a.active').removeClass('active'); $('#menu').find('a[href="' + this.id + '"]').addClass('active')
[00:30:28] <flobin> ooh of course
[00:30:32] <Cork> flobin: ya, combining is ok too
[00:30:37] <flobin> that’s clever, thanks!
[00:31:11] <Cork> flobin: though don't combine $('#menu').find('a[href="' + this.id + '"]')
[00:31:21] <vinex08> hi, i just need suggestions from you guys... i have a video (can be hosted via Vimeo) and at the end of the video i want a link to appear
[00:31:25] <vinex08> what do i need to do
[00:31:27] <Cork> the attribute selector is heavy so handle it with care
[00:31:48] <flobin> what exactly do you mean by combining?
[00:32:01] <Cork> vinex08: you have to check if vimeo provides an api callback for when the video ends
[00:32:06] <Cork> vinex08: if they don't then you can't
[00:32:27] <Cork> flobin: $('#menu').find('a[href="' + this.id + '"]') vs $('#menu a[href="' + this.id + '"]')
[00:32:43] <flobin> right, gotcha
[00:32:49] <Kartagis> *sigh*
[00:34:25] <vinex08> Got it COrk. thanks
[00:37:45] <Cork> vinex08: to extend the info a bit, as the video plays in an iframe, from cross domain, you can't interact with it
[00:37:58] <Cork> and that is why they need to provide an api for cross domain info
[00:39:15] <vinex08> not a jquery question: can you suggest 'website' that does interactive videos? i think i saw one -- wistia.com
[00:39:35] <vinex08> maybe you have something in mind that's better
[00:59:19] <Cork> vinex08: https://developer.vimeo.com/player/js-api
[00:59:31] <Cork> specifically player.addEvent('finish', onFinish); is what you're looking for
[00:59:53] <Duvdevan> window = undefined; // will it work?
[01:00:07] <Duvdevan> window = undefined; // will it work?
[01:00:14] <Cork> Duvdevan: work for what?
[01:00:33] <Duvdevan> is it possible to assign the infamous "undefined" value to the window object?
[01:00:50] <yeah_m> Hi, I have an AJAX Post error which seems rather odd.
[01:01:15] <yeah_m> Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET : this shows up when posting a string that is higher than 316 characters.
[01:01:47] <Duvdevan> server fucked up yeah_m
[01:02:07] <rindolf> Hi all.
[01:02:08] <yeah_m> It works with one character less. It seems to fuck up for one character over?
[01:02:36] <yeah_m> Too bizarre of a limitation.
[01:03:13] <Cork> yeah_m: the server sends a http 101 response
[01:03:55] <yeah_m> Is there any way I can use the inspector from chrome to give you more information? That is all I get as a warning.
[01:06:15] <naquad> hi
[01:06:27] <rindolf> naquad: hello. sup?
[01:07:48] <naquad> i need to find out is there an element matching selector before the given element? i've found el.prevAll().find(sel).length > 0 but that search only on the siblings level while i need a whole document. can jquery help me here somehow?
[01:08:17] <Cork> naquad: there isn't any "before" in the dom
[01:08:22] <Cork> it's a tree structure
[01:08:48] <Cork> naquad: you can do it but it is a bad idea and you should rethink the structure you have
[01:08:52] <naquad> i mean if parents previous sibling contains given selector
[01:09:07] <Cork> ya, same answer
[01:09:12] <naquad> needed for seo: checking is there h2-6 before h1
[01:09:28] <Cork> ah
[01:10:28] <Cork> you could try something like $('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6').index('h1') > 0
[01:12:06] <yeam> Hey, when I send data through .ajax type:'post', I get an error on server side if data exceeds a miniscule character count in a string.
[01:12:14] <yeam> this is the error as stated: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET
[01:12:35] <Cork> yeam: if you want an answer don't leave after asking
[01:12:45] <yeam> Is there something within any .ini file I have to change?
[01:12:55] <yeam> I downloaded IRC instead of entering via browser.
[01:13:47] <Cork> yeam: the server resets the connection, so you would have to check what happens there
[01:14:00] <Cork> so, offtopic for this channel
[01:14:32] <yeam> I'm unfamiliar with how to log an error after receiving it from client side. Where do I go to find any errors that occur after an ajax call?
[01:15:01] <Cork> yeam: in the server logs
[01:15:05] <Cork> the problem is server side
[01:15:21] <yeam> Thanks I'll check it out.
[01:24:50] <PeraPeric> i'm using twitter typeahead.js with multiple datasets. how can I get name of the dataset on select event?
[01:25:39] <Duvdevan> on select do something
[01:38:08] <batjony> hello guys, does someone know a plugin, which converts a standard multiple select form field into multiple checkboxes with a search filter ?

[02:06:23] <naquad> Cork, thanks for the idea with .index() not exactly that way, but i've managed to do it by assuming position in resulting set maps to position in the tree
[02:13:42] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/gtfpa4oq/ why aren't I getting anything when I check jquery mobile?
[02:21:10] <Siphion> Kartagis: scroll result section ;) jquery mobile modify the document and add divs and others elements
[02:22:26] <Kartagis> oh, I still get stuff. there is this one big div

[02:28:54] <justrohu> Hello everyone
[02:28:59] <justrohu> I am new to jquery
[02:29:03] <arunbabu> How do I format the display type of an input field with type=datetime-local ? Presently it is dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm:ss. I need to make it dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm
[02:29:52] <justrohu> what is the difference between 	$(document).on('click','selector',function(){ } & $(selector).on('click',function(){});
[02:31:06] <gregoryLwD> justrohu, I think they are just different (and acceptable) styles of writing the same thing.
[02:32:17] <gregoryLwD> justrohu, oh apart from if 'selector' object isn't in the HTML DOM when the page loads then .on will only work if you attached it to the (document)
[02:33:33] <justrohu> gregoryLwD, thanks .. I was wondering in both cases how the event will bubble up
[02:36:08] <hejner> Hey! I have a bit of a problem with the autocomplete plugin. I'm searching an array with, for example, company name, company phone and company vat. The problem is I only want to show company name (label), and I only want the value to be company phone. I still want to be able to search company VAT, though. So far, I've redefined the jQuery.ui.autocomplete.filter function, but that messes with every autocomplete, and is a messy way to do it. Anyone got a good idea
[02:40:56] <Omar-> justrohu first one called event delegation, it will work with dynamically added elements
[02:43:49] <justrohu> Omar-, ok but we use .on instead of .live for dynamically added elements. so in both case this is happening right.. but the first code is working for me and the later one not .
[03:09:09] <Omar-> justrohu .on and .live are the same but the former replaces the latter in 1.9
[03:09:15] <Omar-> both does exactly the same
[03:10:19] <Omar-> $(.parent or document).on(event, .selector, function() works with elements that arent present when DOM is ready. the ones added later
[03:10:48] <justrohu> Omar-,  Thank you  :)
[03:10:53] <Omar-> $(.selector).on(event, function() works only with the elements present in DOM when jquery is intialized
[03:11:06] <Omar-> justrohu np :)
[03:11:23] <Omar-> i can create a demo for you if you want
[03:13:00] <justrohu> Omar-, No .. thanks I was just confused on both methods that's all
[03:13:15] <justrohu> Omar-, Thank you for clearing it out
[03:13:21] <Omar-> you're welcome
[03:18:29] <salutTEKI> Hello, do you know some libs for create map like this http://dofustools.everhate.com/index.php?page=carte ?

[03:45:56] <bobbobbins> Hey, I'm using clone to copy all the options from one multiselect to another, but the selected options don't copy over as selected...how can I do that?
[03:48:17] <Cork> bobbobbins: you would have to set it manually
[03:48:24] <Cork> clone doesn't copy state

[04:55:29] <illio> I'm looking for a plugin that given a text like "This is an example, purely for illustrative purposes" allows a user to choose individual words in this text by clicking them.. thus effectively some kind of keyword selection plugin.

[05:24:09] <Changa> Hello, I have this code $(".expand").bind( "click", function() { $(this).animate({height:"100%"},1000); }); but the animation runs instantly despite of 1000.
[05:25:03] <Changa> any idea what am I doing wrong?
[05:29:15] <dan2k3k4> Any idea why $('#myElem').tabs(); would cause an AJAX load for the current page ? :/ it causes map errors with "Map is already defined for Leaflet.js"
[05:30:15] <dan2k3k4> I have angular and need to slowly remove all jQuery calls so unsure if it's something to do with that? It shouldn't be as all other pages work... I've narrowed it down to just the .tabs() line
[05:54:30] <hejner> Hey! I have a bit of a problem with the autocomplete plugin. I'm searching an array with, for example, company name, company phone and company vat.

[05:59:35] <dan2k3k4> figured out the page is reloading with $().tabs(); because of the <a href="#elem">
[06:04:11] <dan2k3k4> I think angular is loading <a href="#elem"> links when you run $.tabs :o
[06:05:41] <greg_f> Is it possible to catch when callback occurs?
[06:06:15] <randomguy1> what do you mean catch?
[06:07:27] <Justus> greg_f: you can wrap the callback in your own function
[06:07:53] <greg_f> Justus: ty
[06:12:49] <dan2k3k4> My tabs 'header' code is basically using <li><a href="/my/site/?my=query&some=thingElse#IDFORJQUERYTABS">First Tab</a></li>
[06:13:16] <dan2k3k4> and so I assume angular (or jquery as it seems to be jquery call at the end?) parses that and tries to load that page with ajax
[06:14:47] <randomguy1> huh, i would have thought your #IDFOR... would need to preceed the query params, interesting
[06:15:53] <dan2k3k4> if I do: <a href="#IDFOR"></a>
[06:16:14] <dan2k3k4> then init the $ tabs, it loads the domain inside the tabs o_0 so being localhost/
[06:16:49] <dan2k3k4> I have the <base-tag> elem which I causes "problems" like this but I need it for angular :/
[06:17:10] <dan2k3k4> <base href="/">
[06:17:13] <dan2k3k4> in <head>
[06:17:49] <Omar-> dan2k3k4 you can preventDefault() and activate required tab
[06:18:20] <dan2k3k4> but putting <a href="<?=$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']?>#IDFORTAB"> - stops it loading the home page
[06:18:29] <Omar-> something like $(.selector").tabs("option", "active",index of tab)
[06:18:49] <dan2k3k4> hence why randomguy1 it ends up being /path/to/current/page?queryID
[06:19:26] <dan2k3k4> Omar-, this happens if my code is just: $('#myTabs').tabs();
[06:19:36] <dan2k3k4> which I need to do to initialise the tabs
[06:22:35] <Omar-> dan2k3k4 so you're using only tabs widget, right?
[06:23:39] <dan2k3k4> dan2k3k4, large project unsure if there's other jQuery UI stuff hidden somewhere but I don't think so - therefore just tabs yeah
[06:23:49] <dan2k3k4> there's things like fadeIn/out but I think that's stock jQuery
[06:25:38] <dan2k3k4> See the 'bug' here : http://plnkr.co/edit/WysSB9ASF5s3gRfb9MIB
[06:25:48] <dan2k3k4> console log -> you can see it tries to load mozilla
[06:25:59] <Omar-> ok
[06:29:04] <Omar-> dan2k3k4 I guess I know the problem
[06:29:37] <dan2k3k4> http://tjvantoll.com/2013/02/17/using-jquery-ui-tabs-with-the-base-tag/
[06:29:43] <dan2k3k4> seems like it exists since 2013
[06:30:37] <dan2k3k4> seems I need : 'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] .
[06:30:42] <dan2k3k4> before REQUEST_URI
[06:33:33] <dan2k3k4> bleh that didn't work
[06:34:16] <Omar-> i'm trying to fix it
[06:37:33] <dan2k3k4> I'm wondering if it's because I don't update my <base href="/">
[06:39:21] <dan2k3k4> between page nav -> angular.http ( new page ) -> loads the map page, but then once that page is loaded it runs the initTabs code which I presume sees base href=/ but URL is /some/other/place... so it 'preloads' the page inside the tab? :s
[06:43:07] <Omar-> there is fix for this i saw it somewhere before
[06:44:50] <Omar-> dan2k3k4 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7169
[06:45:07] <Omar-> i know its for jQM but its taken from jQ-ui
[06:45:51] <NonSecwitter> What does this mean? '/Finance/Ledger.aspx?_link=7hxD71I3CkYueseAVyxFzSOmSowQM9FdW5oK%2bYd9K6E%3d&jqGridID=grdLedger'
[06:46:22] <NonSecwitter> jQuery('#grdLedger').jqGrid({url: '/Finance/Ledger.aspx?_link=7hxD71I3CkYueseAVyxFzSOmSowQM9FdW5oK%2bYd9K6E%3d&jqGridID=grdLedger'
[06:54:50] <dan2k3k4> Omar-, I need all that code? :o
[07:00:43] <doebi> can i somehow setup an handler, that gets executed like any ajax.done. sth like a global ajax.done event?
[07:03:11] <NonSecwitter> What is the _link component of that code I posted, and how do I find out what that link does?
[07:06:09] <decx> how would we know ?
[07:08:04] <NonSecwitter> I mean, what does it do?
[07:08:34] <NonSecwitter> Is it a document with code in it?
[07:08:45] <NonSecwitter> A function?
[07:09:03] <decx> ledger.aspx eats the parameter
[07:09:31] <decx> and poops out a response based on that
[07:10:07] <NonSecwitter> So, that mess means something within Ledgre.aspx ?
[07:10:43] <decx> we know nothing
[07:10:49] <decx> we're basicly jon snow
[07:10:58] <Justus> that, or the developers felt a need to overcomplicate everything  by useless information. maybe they wanted to confuse people.
[07:11:00] <decx> look into that asp
[07:11:37] <NonSecwitter> <form name="Form1" method="post" action="Ledger.aspx?_link=7hxD71I3CkYueseAVyxFzSOmSowQM9FdW5oK%2bYd9K6E%3d" onsubmit="javascript:return WebForm_OnSubmit();" id="Form1">
[07:11:49] <NonSecwitter> (i normally code in C++, this is a bit outside my comfort zone
[07:12:17] <NonSecwitter> So, when the _link is appended to my url, it's calling the "onsubmit" property?
[07:12:29] <decx> no
[07:12:53] <decx> this is probably just a hodgepodge of different things working (or not working) together
[07:13:05] <Justus> NonSecwitter: you may want to start with a html tutorial :|
[07:13:09] <NonSecwitter> mostly not working...
[07:13:23] <decx> as you've pasted a jquery method before which is possibly hijacking the submit event
[07:13:32] <decx> as said, we know nothing about your backend
[07:13:41] <decx> or even the frontend
[07:14:31] <NonSecwitter> me either... our software's ledger has been broken for 2 years...
[07:15:04] <NonSecwitter> We pay a company that pays a code house in India to develop a platform built using Code On Time (all of this is against my advisement)
[07:15:18] <Justus> lol
[07:15:34] <decx> yikes
[07:15:46] <NonSecwitter> yea... it's a thorn in my side
[07:16:35] <NonSecwitter> so, the ledger requires that you enter service dates to filter results. it's about 50/50 whether the same criteria will return "No Result Found" or the actual results.
[07:17:08] <NonSecwitter> So far... i hope you laugh... they have told us that solution is to have our end users open the developer tools and set the document compatability mode to IE9
[07:17:20] <decx> so it's like a financial lottery
[07:17:29] <decx> occupy ledger.aspx
[07:17:35] <NonSecwitter> Not only is this a terrible solution... it's not affective. We get the same results
[07:17:57] <randomguy1> time to find a new solution, lol
[07:18:21] <NonSecwitter> the COO and I are looking into is, the Executive Dir won't have it
[07:18:36] <NonSecwitter> He's caught in the vicious cycle of "We've invested too much to walk away"
[07:19:04] <randomguy1> are you keeping track of how much man hours are being spent patching it?  that builds expense too
[07:19:26] <decx> if it only works 50% of the time with some obscure hack i doubt that's the only expense
[07:19:37] <NonSecwitter> I've worked here since Nov, and I've lost track. They've had the system for 3 years
[07:19:49] <NonSecwitter> this a snowflak on the tip of the iceberg
[07:19:54] <NonSecwitter> snowflake*
[07:20:02] <randomguy1> yellow snow
[07:20:06] <decx> either way we've got nothing to go on from what you've pasted
[07:20:26] <Justus> I can certainly help you out there, but I guess your boss won't like the bill ;)
[07:20:42] <arc_> NonSecwitter sounds like you need to introduce your executive director to the sunk cost fallacy
[07:21:00] <NonSecwitter> Justus: He won't... he has the lowest bid mentality
[07:21:28] <decx> might just be some weird bug that could be fixed in a few minutes by a webdev, it all can seem a bit weird if you come from c++
[07:21:46] <randomguy1> out of curiosity, you say it fails around 50% of the time?  how big is your user base?
[07:21:48] <Justus> there's this nice little plaque for repair shops "We fix it - $20/h, We fix it while you watch - $30/h, We fix it and you help - $40/h. You worked on it before - double the price."
[07:22:25] <NonSecwitter> randomguy1: for the ledger? 2 people. For the entire system? 45
[07:22:56] <randomguy1> ooooh, is that 50% system wide?  i thought that was just for the ledger part
[07:23:08] <decx> blimey
[07:23:17] <Justus> that's high even for corporate software :D
[07:23:41] <Dorf> can i use .not() on an element?
[07:23:53] <randomguy1> Dorf: sure
[07:24:30] <decx> not is just filter in a nice dress
[07:25:36] <Dorf> so $('li').not('input').on('touch', function () .... should make it so that when someone touches the input below a li the function doesn't fire, right?  or am i reading it wrong?
[07:25:52] <decx> yeah that's wrong
[07:25:58] <decx> not will filter a collection of elements
[07:26:11] <decx> if your collection is all li then none of them will be input
[07:26:24] <elsevero> anyone managed to have this (http://isotope.metafizzy.co/v1/tests/combo-sort-history.html#comboFilters[size]=.big&comboFilters[color]=.yellow&comboFilters[shape]=&sortBy=size) in latest version of this library (http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) ?
[07:26:45] <Dorf> it's more specific than that
[07:27:05] <Justus> Dorf: is there a reason you don't use the selector?
[07:27:23] <Dorf> i don't want the item hiding when someone clicks the input
[07:27:25] <Dorf> holdon
[07:27:29] <randomguy1> not is a filter, not a finder
[07:27:35] <Justus> Dorf: $('li > not(input)')
[07:27:37] <decx> $('li').on('touch',function(e){ if ($(e.target).closest('input') return )
[07:27:48] <decx> $('li').on('touch',function(e){ if ($(e.target).closest('input').length) return )
[07:27:55] <decx> soemthing like that
[07:29:06] <Justus> Dorf: $('li :not(input)') will select all childelements of lis that are not inputs
[07:29:30] <NonSecwitter> This probably seems obvious, but I am pretty sure the ledger probably is an issue with the data request.
[07:29:30] <decx> use the e.target thing or you enter selector hell
[07:29:41] <NonSecwitter> I just don't know where the data is being requested, or how it's being returned
[07:29:48] <NonSecwitter> I have a feeling this has something to do with it http://pastebin.com/Qy56t2Tx
[07:30:16] <Justus> NonSecwitter: Are you an experienced JS developer?
[07:30:40] <NonSecwitter> Not in the least. I've worked with Java, SQL, and C++ (batch and powershell in there)
[07:31:19] <decx> what a mess -.-
[07:31:28] <Justus> then your boss is screwed, an experienced JS developer will likely need a day or two to track this kind of nonsense down, if the problem even is in the js, and not just a symptom of another deeper problem
[07:31:55] <randomguy1> anyone else in the shop proficient?
[07:32:03] <randomguy1> or are you 'the' guy
[07:32:05] <Justus> as an unexperienced developer in this language you will not be able to solve this in under a week (unless you get jackpot-lucky)
[07:32:15] <decx> boss be like "but i already pay a programmer, now where's that mason who's supposed to do my plumbing"
[07:32:52] <Dorf> http://jsfiddle.net/92g2hduf/
[07:33:01] <Dorf> i want it to not fire when someone clicks in the input
[07:33:11] <Justus> decx: yeah, had those a couple of times in projects, I milked them for what they were worth then left the burning building before it broke down. Sometimes a good papertrail is worth a lot of money :D
[07:33:19] <Dorf> if that's possible
[07:33:46] <NonSecwitter> randomguy1: I'm the only IT guy
[07:33:53] <decx> Dorf http://jsfiddle.net/decx/92g2hduf/1/
[07:34:00] <decx> like i said :p
[07:34:24] <Dorf> sorry... i missed it trying to build the pen
[07:34:27] <NonSecwitter> I do all of the sysadmin and try to unmess this system they are using. I code on my own time
[07:35:03] <Justus> NonSecwitter: Then I suggest you look for another job, because if this requirement isn't dropped and you can't proof you're not at fault you'll need one
[07:35:13] <NonSecwitter> decx: are you referring to the code being a mess?
[07:35:23] <randomguy1> the situation
[07:35:24] <decx> that pastebin?
[07:35:26] <decx> yeah
[07:35:30] <Justus> NonSecwitter: also you probably want another job since that will certainly not be the last time something like this happens
[07:35:56] <NonSecwitter> Justus: It's not on me to fix it. I just wanted to see what I could figure otu
[07:36:26] <decx> i looked over the pastebin and didnt see anything suspicios, but it was hard to keep track
[07:36:45] <randomguy1> NonSecwitter: then what I might suggest is, if you have time, take a look at the jquery tutorial on the website.  would probably be a good starting point for getting your feet wet
[07:36:50] <Justus> NonSecwitter: well, grab a html tutorial, proceed with a jquery+js tutorial, then try your luck.
[07:36:59] <NonSecwitter> tutorials it is
[07:37:18] <decx> send requests to your server directly first to see if the frontend is even the problem
[07:37:30] <NonSecwitter> decx: No idea how to do that
[07:37:45] <NonSecwitter> I've just been learning about the console and debugger in chrome
[07:38:19] <randomguy1> NonSecwitter: what is your primary browser?
[07:38:34] <randomguy1> crap, you said chrome, lol
[07:38:41] <NonSecwitter> IE 8 is "required" by the developers
[07:38:43] <decx> if you dont do either web backend or frontend then you'll just burn hours trying to track it down
[07:38:49] <NonSecwitter> The dev tools in chrome seem to work better, though
[07:39:16] <NonSecwitter> And when I say IE8 is required, I mean that as the HIGHEST version
[07:39:22] <randomguy1> NonSecwitter: as a developer tool, I'd suggest getting the chrome addon "cREST".  Handy tool for firing off random html requests for testing.
[07:39:41] <decx> wow up to ie8
[07:40:06] <randomguy1> sorry, "http" request
[07:43:32] <NonSecwitter> typically, I use ie11... It's kind of interesting. Each component of the website works in a different browser version, so we can't even set automatic compatibility mode.
[07:44:17] <NonSecwitter> They have refused to add UAX tags as a work around (i would prefer code revision, but it seems unlikely)
[07:44:34] <decx> is it at least just an internal facing site?
[07:44:53] <decx> those are the best to dev for -> http://i.imgur.com/vJi0tci.gifv
[07:45:08] <NonSecwitter> They host on the cloud, so it can be gotten by the public
[07:46:04] <Dorf> decx: thank you for the help
[07:46:11] <NonSecwitter> I usually don't use the 'c' word, but I have no idea where the servers are
[07:46:51] <xqo> hi, does "new Worker("myfile.js") load the file anew everytime you construct a worker for the same file?
[07:49:50] <randomguy1> xqo: unsure, but I'd imagine after the first pull it would use the cached version for subsequent creations
[07:50:12] <randomguy1> unless something keeps it from getting a 301
[07:50:40] <randomguy1> you could look at your network tab in your browser to confirm
[08:08:30] <dimi1947> I have an array with 2 values and I want to pass them into an object that has the following structure var day:{open:value1,close:value2} https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/orkamhty/
[08:09:08] <dimi1947> fill the input boxes...click add and open the console to see the array being produced
[08:09:31] <dimi1947> function at line 38
[08:11:31] <randomguy1> so, question.  is there a reason you avoiding the direct lookup and doing the group selector?
[08:12:03] <randomguy1> cause day.open = $('#from_mond_b').val() would be more simplistic
[08:12:39] <dimi1947> with the group selector I target both inputs at once
[08:12:49] <randomguy1> right
[08:13:16] <dimi1947> beside the one is from and the other till
[08:13:43] <randomguy1> right, but what i'm saying is, now your logic going forward is going to be reliant upon element position
[08:14:20] <dimi1947> I do not understand...what do you mean...can you be more specific?
[08:14:22] <randomguy1> reliance upon element position is typically a fragile approach
[08:14:44] <randomguy1> so, right now your selector is returning both values
[08:14:58] <randomguy1> at this point in time, the first one would be open and the second one close
[08:14:58] <dimi1947> what is bad with that?"
[08:15:12] <dimi1947> exactly
[08:15:12] <randomguy1> but there is nothing that says in the future their order may not change
[08:16:14] <dimi1947> the only way they can change is by changing the markup...that is totally dependent on  me
[08:16:21] <randomguy1> for now, :)
[08:16:33] <randomguy1> are you the only programmer that is going to touch this code base ever?
[08:16:57] <dimi1947> of course for now...ok you made your point....what do you propose?
[08:17:41] <randomguy1> just look them up each by their id and then you can put them in the variable you want.
[08:17:41] <dimi1947> what can I do so that I can account for future changes
[08:18:21] <dimi1947> ok....there is a reason though I am doing things I am doing them
[08:18:52] <dimi1947> the inputs you see there are of fixed number...namely 2
[08:19:45] <dimi1947> in the app I am making...the inputs are not in the markup...they are added later in the DOM...by clicking a button and thei number may vary from 2 to 12
[08:20:21] <dimi1947> so with the group selector I can target all of them...whether they are 2,4 or 6 or 8
[08:20:54] <dimi1947> it is up to the user how many inputs are going to be added to the DOM
[08:21:48] <randomguy1> so multiple form and till rows?
[08:21:52] <randomguy1> form
[08:21:55] <randomguy1> from, dang it
[08:22:14] <dimi1947> yes...muliple
[08:22:27] <decx> what's that object supposed to look like with multiple?
[08:23:10] <randomguy1> are you going to be appending a number to those ids to make them unique?  *nod nod* ?
[08:24:06] <dimi1947> what makes unique every input is the weekday in combination with the from/till clause
[08:24:30] <dimi1947> the onject will look like this...
[08:24:36] <randomguy1> huh?  no, i'm saying 'from_mond_b'.  only one element can have that id
[08:24:53] <dimi1947> yes only one element
[08:25:23] <randomguy1> right, so if there are multiple, how would that id look on each of them
[08:25:33] <dimi1947> for example...tuesday's ID will be from_tuesday_b
[08:25:40] <randomguy1> ahhhh, gotcha
[08:26:23] <dimi1947> var values={monday:{open:value,close:value}};
[08:26:42] <dimi1947> that is the intended form of the object
[08:27:00] <dimi1947> but I do not know how to get there
[08:27:28] <randomguy1> what you could do then is store your collection that you have (without the map)
[08:27:37] <randomguy1> then you could filter on starting with whatever
[08:28:04] <randomguy1> $variable.filter('[id^=from_mond]')
[08:28:17] <randomguy1> $variable.filter('[id^="from_mond"]')
[08:28:45] <randomguy1> likewise for the end one
[08:29:34] <dimi1947> I am confused a little...can you write it on the fiddle please?
[08:29:38] <randomguy1> yep
[08:29:57] <steveccc> hi all - I am using .text to alter an html element but I was hoping to have a number gradually increasing so I thought I could add it to a for loop but this seems too quick so I presumed I could add delay() to the end to reduce the speed of the number update but that doesnt seem to help - can anyone advise please
[08:31:02] <randomguy1> https://jsfiddle.net/orkamhty/22/
[08:31:09] <hlvwrk>  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:31:38] <randomguy1> forgot the val()...
[08:31:53] <randomguy1> https://jsfiddle.net/orkamhty/23/
[08:32:28] <decx> here's a testier testcase http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5r4vhrar/
[08:34:10] <dimi1947> good code but some mods nust be made to bring it exactly in the state I want
[08:34:44] <randomguy1> most likely.  just an example of the type of selector you could use
[08:34:50] <decx> right
[08:34:55] <decx> a testcase if you will ^^
[08:35:12] <dimi1947> instead of from mond I will put open...likewise for till monday
[08:35:17] <dimi1947> but must important
[08:35:26] <decx> you could use data-attributes instead of the id split
[08:35:32] <decx> for example
[08:35:58] <randomguy1> at that point 'from' and 'till' could become classes
[08:36:09] <dimi1947> how am I going to pass these 2 values as properties of another object
[08:36:45] <randomguy1> steveccc: have you tried implementing the incrementing with setInterval?
[08:37:15] <randomguy1> steveccc: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=DOM%2Fwindow.setInterval
[08:37:38] <decx> you can use animate to sidestep the setinterval headaches
[08:37:44] <randomguy1> oh?
[08:37:50] <decx> mom
[08:40:32] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5vrb90ze/
[08:41:53] <randomguy1> hmm, doesn't seem to be stepping for me.
[08:42:16] <decx> huh
[08:43:07] <randomguy1> i'm in the latest firefox if that has any effect
[08:43:44] <decx> shouldnt make a difference
[08:44:03] <decx> hm
[08:44:10] <decx> updated from 37 and can confirm
[08:44:13] <randomguy1> nope still sitting at 500 in chrome also
[08:44:24] <decx> chrome works fine
[08:44:37] <randomguy1> it hates me, X(
[08:44:51] <decx> oh
[08:44:53] <decx> +end
[08:44:56] <decx> or parseInt
[08:45:22] <decx> huh now it works again
[08:45:24] <randomguy1> boom
[08:45:25] <decx> curious
[08:45:26] <steveccc> decx: animate is working for me but its not steping up - just taking the original text and then after aperiod of time fading the new text and not going 1, 2, 3, 4 etc
[08:45:28] <decx> without
[08:45:28] <randomguy1> saw it
[08:45:33] <randomguy1> really fast though, :)
[08:45:47] <decx> well you can add a duration property
[08:46:06] <decx> that's why i used this approach in the past, to not have to deal with setinterval for that
[08:46:09] <randomguy1> that is nice though.  will have to play with that in my off time
[08:46:20] <decx> step calculation
[08:46:22] <decx> and stuff
[08:47:36] <decx> it goes 1,2,3 now tho steveccc
[08:48:24] <steveccc> decx: no - i have an initial figure of 0 and then it fades to the end number - it doesnt count
[08:48:48] <decx> weird
[08:51:50] <sigger> Hi, is there a way to use jQuery datepicker $.datepicker.parseDate() with the current locale? I would like to not re-set the desired date format. Thank you in advance
[08:52:08] <steveccc> decx: this is the code - is that correct http://pastebin.com/DPFiw2ec
[08:52:13] <sigger> for clarification: I use the jQuery Ui datepicer i18n extensions
[08:52:22] <robertmaxrees> sigger why not initialize with the right locale in the first place?
[08:52:27] <decx> steveccc try the fiddle i posted
[08:52:57] <decx> this wont work because fadeout doesnt wait for the loop to be done
[08:52:58] <sigger> robertmaxrees: Thank you for your reply. I think i did, with the exentions. But i don't know how i can "read" the current format
[08:53:17] <robertmaxrees> sigger it should all be in the correct format - you shouldn't need to do anything else.
[08:53:53] <sigger> But is the format not a mandatory attribute for .parseDate()? Or can i obtain the current date-format somehow?
[08:54:05] <robertmaxrees> sigger huh?
[08:54:47] <dimi1947> randomguy are you there?
[08:54:48] <sigger> I have a ISO Date i'd like to format to what ever the current locale date format is
[08:54:59] <dimi1947> your code might work....
[08:55:05] <randomguy1> i am
[08:55:09] <robertmaxrees> sigger ah, so you want to convert a date from one format to another?
[08:55:20] <dimi1947> for the input that are not add in the DOM...I get undefined
[08:55:29] <sigger> yes, sorry that i'am so unclear- i think i don't even know what i do my self ;)
[08:55:40] <robertmaxrees> sigger do you havea fiddle to demonstrate?
[08:55:47] <steveccc> decx: yes that works thanks. If i had three separate numbers could i just repeat three times if i wanted the first to animate then the second then the third etc
[08:55:57] <sigger> hmm yes, one second
[08:55:59] <steveccc> decx: or would they run concurrently
[08:56:00] <dimi1947> that is not a problem I think...I will use a ternary operator to scan when are defined and get the values then
[08:56:18] <decx> you could cann the next one in your complete step steveccc
[08:56:24] <decx> call the next one*
[08:56:34] <randomguy1> dimi1947: you can do .length off of the filter() to see if anything was found
[08:58:28] <dimi1947> what is the syntax for that?
[08:58:51] <randomguy1> $variable.filter(...whatever...).length
[08:59:04] <dimi1947> yes but there is a problem...
[08:59:46] <dimi1947> with the database....the way now the database is structures it awaits 7 days....EITHER WAY
[09:00:07] <randomguy1> huh?
[09:00:11] <dimi1947> and the days that are not in the DOM I just use null
[09:00:27] <dimi1947> you must be wondering why I did it like so
[09:00:40] <randomguy1> no, your 'awaits' is throwing me off
[09:00:53] <sigger> Arg... too bad, need to leave- Sorry. But thank you very much. I will try to get back to you later. Bye
[09:01:26] <randomguy1> so your saying, regardless of how many from and till combos you have, you store all 7 days in the db?
[09:01:27] <dimi1947> I mean the database stores all 7 days....wether there is values to them or not
[09:01:37] <randomguy1> that's fine
[09:01:45] <dimi1947> exactly....and do you know why?
[09:01:55] <randomguy1> that's how you like to roll, :)
[09:02:06] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what does your JS have to do with your DB?
[09:02:06] <dimi1947> null day....translates into store being closed
[09:02:52] <randomguy1> in that case whatever structure your using to sent the froms and tills, you can default them to null
[09:02:58] <randomguy1> and only set them if they are found
[09:03:06] <randomguy1> sent=send
[09:03:18] <dimi1947> how I can default them to null
[09:03:26] <randomguy1> just don't include them on the request object
[09:03:30] <robertmaxrees> ^ only send dates that exist, and let your backend figure out the rest.
[09:04:04] <dimi1947> you mean I let the backend set the NULL for the days
[09:04:09] <randomguy1> yep
[09:04:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:04:24] <randomguy1> request doesn't have from and till?  null!
[09:04:46] <steveccc> decx: done it thanks. Is it possible to loop?
[09:04:56] <dimi1947> I do not understand what do you mean with this last phrase
[09:05:02] <decx> loop in what way?
[09:05:17] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 which phrase?
[09:05:22] <randomguy1> pseudocode statement of the logic you could do
[09:05:48] <dimi1947> "request....bla bla"
[09:06:20] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 right, if the data from the page doens't have a from and till for a date, use your backend to set it to null.
[09:06:30] <steveccc> decx: so that the number could reset and then animate again - basically the same function you wrote over and over again
[09:07:23] <decx> uhm
[09:07:40] <dimi1947> yes the problem though now is that your code targets specific days....how am I going to target only the inputs added to the DOM
[09:07:55] <decx> steveccc http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5vrb90ze/4/
[09:08:03] <dimi1947> with length I just find the number of them...
[09:08:17] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 do you have a fiddle or something to help us visualize what you're working with?
[09:09:26] <randomguy1> dimi1947: length will let you know if it exists on the page.  such that from the fiddle i edited. $bElements.filter('id^="from_mond"').length > 0 would let you know there is a monday pair
[09:09:43] <randomguy1> so you'd have to in some fashion check each day pair to see if they exist, and if so, process them
[09:09:52] <mifritscher> hi
[09:10:06] <randomguy1> left out the brackets in that filter, but ...
[09:10:28] <mifritscher> jqueryui / slider: How can I color the knows (more than 3) individually?
[09:10:38] <robertmaxrees> "the knows" mifritscher?
[09:10:44] <mifritscher> *knobs
[09:10:48] <mifritscher> the handles
[09:12:00] <mifritscher> the thing with the css-class .ui-slider-handle ;-)
[09:12:02] <decx> you'll need some expert knob twiddlers
[09:12:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:12:34] <decx> that album is 19 years old... jesus -.-
[09:12:46] <mifritscher> I found only aproaches which colored all the handles using .ui-slider-handle - or using first/last
[09:13:03] <robertmaxrees> right.  those are really your only options.
[09:13:19] <robertmaxrees> since each handle doens't have a unique class or ID.
[09:13:29] <mifritscher> :-(
[09:13:44] <mifritscher> hmm, ok, then I'll try the "big gun" :-D
[09:13:53] <decx> nth-of-type maybe?
[09:14:04] <dimi1947> so you mean I have to make 7 checks...one for each weekday?
[09:14:19] <mifritscher> (iterating all over the a -elements of the div-container and counting)
[09:14:20] <randomguy1> twiddling knobs and handling big guns.  i don't feel comfortable any more...
[09:14:28] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[09:14:37] <decx> boobs
[09:14:46] <mifritscher> :-D
[09:14:54] <ohcibi> i have a div with h1 init. I use jquery scrollTo to scroll to those h1s. the div has a margin-left or a left css property (tried both) which is still enabled after I have used scrollTo (according to chrome dev tools). however its effect is gone. i.e. it mas a (margin-)left of 0. when I disable and reenable it in chrome devtools the margin is back again... same in safari.. whats wrong there?
[09:15:12] <robertmaxrees> ohcibi way too much description and not enough jsfiddle.
[09:15:20] <dimi1947> I suppose you are tired
[09:15:45] <mifritscher> oh guys - it seems that I should clock off^^
[09:15:54] <randomguy1> dimi1947: if your processing them all at once, yeah
[09:16:17] <randomguy1> dimi1947: otherwise if you are processing them one at a time based off of some event, maybe only one
[09:16:56] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't matter either way - if the document is structured sanely, it should be pretty easy to enumerate through stuff.
[09:17:11] <dimi1947> I understand...well I will see what I am going to do....
[09:17:21] <dimi1947> at least I am going somewhere
[09:17:34] <dimi1947> heading I meant
[09:18:20] <randomguy1> or, throwing this out there, is the html markup open for modification?
[09:18:31] <robertmaxrees> hyper text markup language markup ;)
[09:18:39] <randomguy1> shsss
[09:18:49] <randomguy1> lol
[09:19:04] <robertmaxrees> it's all good - go use your PIN Number somewhere :D
[09:21:02] <randomguy1> the reason I ask is if so, you could potentially wrap the pairs in a common class, and you could find and iterate over that collection.  then your logic would primarily be checking the elements to see what day is in the id to know what variables to set
[09:21:23] <decx> man is this still going?
[09:21:30] <decx> i thought my thingy was pretty good
[09:21:33] <randomguy1> dunno, he may have jet
[09:25:24] <robertmaxrees> unf unf unf
[09:28:20] <marduk1984> if click on class .button will do some ajax and that post fails: "500 Internal Server Error." can i use $('.button').ifError = do something? i dont want to edit there code, just want to listen on if error, do something on it
[09:28:48] <robertmaxrees> marduk1984 https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[09:29:42] <marduk1984> robertmaxrees thanks a lot
[09:45:27] <testerbit> I'm using data tables which sometimes take awhile to load rows, meanwhile the user can click and trigger a jquery function, how can I disable a listener while the table is drawing/redrawing?
[09:50:14] <dimi1947> randomguy are you still there?
[09:50:17] <randomguy1> yep
[09:50:26] <dimi1947> I have one q only
[09:51:02] <dimi1947> why using filter after all to target the inputs...I just use their IDs directly....
[09:51:19] <dimi1947> either way...every one is distinct
[09:51:38] <randomguy1> using the filter allows you to do the dom lookup once
[09:51:56] <randomguy1> and you seemed adamant on using your collective selector, ;)
[09:52:09] <dimi1947> give me a sec to write an example....to see what I mean
[09:52:21] <NonSecwitter_> Do any of you do white hat work?
[09:52:41] <randomguy1> you mean black hat?
[09:52:49] <NonSecwitter_> blue hat?
[09:52:53] <randomguy1> lol
[09:52:56] <NonSecwitter_> :D
[09:53:13] <randomguy1> what do you mean?
[09:53:21] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/orkamhty/25/ line 44
[09:53:32] <NonSecwitter_> I just wanted to see if there were any inherent vulnarabilities, starting at the login, for this system.
[09:53:41] <randomguy1> black hat, :P
[09:54:29] <NonSecwitter_> The morons told me it would take a week to set up automatic redirection from http to https... I did it in 30 minutes and made the mistake of telling them how. They refuse to let me talk to the lead engineer, despite all of the knowledge I am feeding them.
[09:54:33] <NonSecwitter_> I should have used it as leverage
[09:54:54] <randomguy1> dimi1947: does that work?  will input#from_mond match partially?  if so, cool
[09:55:28] <dimi1947> it will target precisely the element....why using filter?
[09:56:09] <randomguy1> the code above it that uses the filter, finds all the elements that you might want to work with.  then the filter finds in that collection over and over.
[09:56:23] <randomguy1> it limits the dom searches to 1, which can be a performance gain
[09:56:43] <robertmaxrees> NonSecwitter_ is this for a major site or something?
[09:57:15] <dimi1947> I am confued a little...give me a sec to see what I wrote
[09:59:05] <dimi1947> lines 44...to 55...are you saying this is faster than omitting filter
[09:59:40] <dimi1947> wednesday is missing but I think you get the picture
[10:00:08] <randomguy1> i'm saying line 44 is doing a dom search.  so if you had multiple of those for each id, each of them would be a dom search
[10:00:41] <randomguy1> line 48 falls back to the relying on position thing we talked about earlier
[10:01:50] <dimi1947> why are you mentioning line 48 specifically...there is not a difference with the rest of them
[10:01:52] <fabio> Hello everyone
[10:02:08] <randomguy1> we're both looking at https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/orkamhty/25/ right?
[10:02:19] <LiENUS> so which is going to be faster $('#id').find(':input:enabled:not(.error'){function...} or $('#id').find(':input'){function(){if (!$(this).hasClass('error'))}?
[10:02:25] <fabio> Hello, i'm trying to use this http://git.aaronlumsden.com/material/ before the page is fully loaded.
[10:02:31] <LiENUS> or wil lthey be roughly the same?
[10:02:45] <dimi1947> no I am looking at this https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/957wLhpn/1/
[10:02:48] <fabio> right now i just could do it when document is ready
[10:03:23] <robertmaxrees> LiENUS the latter probably.
[10:03:42] <robertmaxrees> LiENUS except the function would be in a .filter() call.
[10:03:48] <LiENUS> robertmaxrees, but will it be a sigificant amount?
[10:04:04] <randomguy1> ok, line 44 to 55, what are you asking the comparison against?
[10:04:16] <robertmaxrees> not unless you have a ton of inputs / have a really complicated document.
[10:04:31] <LiENUS> err i forgot the :enabled part of the second one
[10:05:04] <LiENUS> robertmaxrees, so $('#id').find(':input:enabled').filter(':not(.error)') might be the way to do it?
[10:05:14] <robertmaxrees> LiENUS http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[10:05:41] <robertmaxrees> you want to basically chain methods instead of selectors.
[10:05:50] <dimi1947> yes you are right....there is nothing to compare against....my point is that the filter is of no use since we are targeting specific IDs
[10:05:52] <robertmaxrees> but the performance difference in most cases will be neglicible.
[10:05:57] <robertmaxrees> *negligible
[10:06:25] <randomguy1> dimi1947: right, since your using the entire id you could change your filters to just filter('#whatever')
[10:06:32] <LiENUS> yeah its already getting restricted...
[10:07:12] <dimi1947> filter is not needed at all?
[10:07:18] <LiENUS> it'll be used on some large complex documents but the id selector puts it on a form thats pretty small
[10:07:28] <robertmaxrees> LiENUS right, but you want to avoid a lot of .find(':input:enabled') type stuff generally.
[10:07:31] <dimi1947> I believe we agree on that?
[10:07:36] <randomguy1> you could do $('#whatever') to look them each up and not have the filter. yes
[10:07:51] <robertmaxrees> those selectors can be a problem.  but again, not an issue in most cases.
[10:07:52] <dimi1947> ok...thanks for now....I am ok
[10:08:03] <LiENUS> well its filtering out the fields that dont pass validation
[10:08:12] <LiENUS> and submitting just the ones that do
[10:08:39] <LiENUS> or it doesnt submit anything if nothing validates
[10:08:55] <LiENUS> its also checking for which fields are dirty and only submitting the dirty fields that pass validation
[10:10:39] <RabSimpson> hi folks. i'm trying to have .bx-wrapper fill its container, but it's loading with a height of zero regardless of what i do, except if i put images or text in it, and then it's only the height of those child elements. any ideas? http://www.mulberrystbarbistro.co.uk/static/
[10:11:30] <randomguy1> RabSimpson: you may have to give it a display: block or something
[10:11:55] <randomguy1> RabSimpson: what's the actualy element tag?
[10:13:20] <RabSimpson> randomguy1: it looks like it's because the height of the container isn't explicitly set
[10:13:33] <decx> give your .container class a height then
[10:14:04] <testerbit> If I use $(document).on( 'draw.dt', function() - everything inside the function will be active on the first draw.dt event or only when NOT drawing?
[10:15:03] <RabSimpson> decx: the container can't have a height set in css.
[10:15:11] <RabSimpson> decx: i know what i need to do though.
[10:15:28] <decx> good
[10:17:27] <pcfreak30> In chrome 31, im trying to test touch events but ontouchend isnt in document?
[10:17:33] <pcfreak30> chrome 41*
[10:18:12] <pcfreak30> the touch punch plugin isnt working as document.ontouchend doesnt exist
[10:19:05] <gambl0re> guys how long does it take to learn javascript/jquery until i can make sexy websites?.
[10:19:20] <randomguy1> gambl0re: mileage may vary
[10:19:25] <gambl0re> and how much javascript should i know before i start learning jquery?.
[10:19:26] <pcfreak30> gambl0re: If you have to ask then I would be a bit worried
[10:19:35] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re depends on how much time you can invest.  also: being a good programmer and being a good designer are two different skills.
[10:19:44] <gambl0re> what are the key concepts i should absolutely know for web development?
[10:19:51] <pcfreak30> Theres no set rules. Each to their own
[10:19:59] <pcfreak30> you learn what you learn
[10:20:23] <pcfreak30> If you really need, go book reading. Though for me, I was self taught
[10:20:37] <randomguy1> i'd say the concepts are mostly the same, if you've done other OO languages
[10:20:42] <decx> think of something you want to do and then do it
[10:20:42] <gambl0re> you self taught yourself without reading a book?
[10:20:51] <randomguy1> sure
[10:20:58] <robertmaxrees> books are supplemental.
[10:21:01] <pcfreak30> Yes been in computers since I was a kid
[10:21:17] <gambl0re> so you're a genius basically?
[10:21:23] <decx> we're here for you on the way :p
[10:21:26] <pcfreak30> So I was naturally gifted in tech and learned off the web, never read a book past html
[10:21:31] <randomguy1> it's not a matter of absorbing everything
[10:21:51] <randomguy1> it's more like "I want to do this.   ..... how do i do that?" and finding a tutorial or info on that
[10:21:58] <pcfreak30> Im one of those kids that was smarter than the teacher even in college :P
[10:22:13] <decx> gee thanks for repeating what i wrote randomguy1 ;)
[10:22:15] <pcfreak30> So you learn the bst way and invest in it if you really want to
[10:22:18] <gambl0re> i'm asking this questions because i could study javascript forever and i wouldn't know if i knew enough to continue on to other stuff.
[10:22:27] <randomguy1> decx: :D sorry
[10:22:33] <pcfreak30> If you hate it or seem it to be like a chore just drop it and move on
[10:22:33] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re you figure it out.
[10:22:37] <gambl0re> what is your job pcfreak?
[10:22:47] <decx> you'll never get anywhere in anything if you want to know everything first
[10:22:48] <Talow> I'm also self tought, I started understanding code simply by right clicking on websites and view source in IE so long ago
[10:22:57] <decx> it's incremental
[10:23:22] <decx> man that sentence is a mouthful to say
[10:23:22] <pcfreak30> gambl0re: Then your in the wrong scene as if you understood it you would know when other concepts are ready to be learned based on how they related to what you DO know.
[10:23:42] <gambl0re> what is your line of work?
[10:23:43] <pcfreak30> If you know something learn new
[10:23:57] <pcfreak30> If a new concept equires basis on what you dont know
[10:24:01] <robertmaxrees> basically, you're always learning.  if you're not regularly at least a little confused about wtf is going on, you're stagnating.
[10:24:06] <pcfreak30> learn it first. Build up
[10:24:20] <pcfreak30> If you have to ask, your not wired correctly to be able to do it
[10:24:27] <gambl0re> pcfreak what kind of job do you do?
[10:24:33] <pcfreak30> im a genious (maybe) in tevh
[10:24:43] <pcfreak30> But im clueless at art past stick figures
[10:24:52] <Talow> that's why I'm here, I've learned C#, and decent enough with PHP and now it's time for jquery
[10:24:58] <decx> i can tell you're in the cringe business
[10:25:06] <gambl0re> are you a programmer? web dev developer?
[10:25:25] <gambl0re> teacher? doctor? janitor?
[10:25:26] <pcfreak30> gambl0re: ATM im just a consultant and small buz owner. I work from home in PJ's and code all day long :)
[10:25:43] <randomguy1> <-- front end/back end developer, not primarily a UI/UXer.  just enjoy the js side
[10:26:07] <pcfreak30> I know front end, back end and a shit ton of other things. Everything but design/art
[10:26:16] <decx> <-- eierlegende wollmilchsau
[10:26:33] <pcfreak30> Im 23 with 10+ years now exp and picked up a lot very quickly
[10:26:59] <pcfreak30> So if you want to learn and you dont enjoy it, just screw it and move on.
[10:27:17] <gambl0re> like i said, you can learn your entire life.
[10:27:23] <pcfreak30> Cause I refuse doing something I dislike myself and feel that should apply to others
[10:27:30] <gambl0re> thats why universities are 4 years.
[10:28:06] <pcfreak30> And maybe I just got lucky as I knew what my carrer was as a kid
[10:28:16] <pcfreak30> career*
[10:28:18] <decx> well, university is just a tool to give you a glimpse on what you want to do with your life
[10:29:04] <pcfreak30> decx: For me so far, it as just to get a dumb degree to flash around and have an excuse to sleep in class. a 1 hr 40 min class took me 30 min :)
[10:29:18] <gambl0re> well i hope you guys are making a lot of money...
[10:29:31] <pcfreak30> Eh not as much as I would like
[10:29:37] <pcfreak30> im good at tech not at buz
[10:29:58] <gambl0re> get that degree and doors start opening up
[10:30:04] <randomguy1> degree's are not only to show proficiency.  they also denote dedication and the ability to learn, which are also important to employeers.
[10:31:06] <pcfreak30> randomguy1: The annoying thing for me was I could probably go to a batchuar or masters degree without learning much. Im at assoc and learned nearly nothing
[10:31:23] <decx> also has a degree in modesty
[10:31:27] <randomguy1> lol
[10:31:28] <pcfreak30> I know mainly all advanced stuff and even some ASM
[10:31:42] <peterson_> why isn't this doing what i think it should do - http://pastebin.com/pVtbp3ZH
[10:31:48] <pcfreak30> Not bragging, stating facts.
[10:31:57] <arc_> batchuar
[10:32:10] <pcfreak30> sorry i didnt put it in google
[10:32:19] <pcfreak30> in good at tech not at writing :P
[10:32:52] <arc_> bachelor's
[10:33:08] <randomguy1> peterson_: dumb question.  what do you think it should do?
[10:33:24] <Talow> I'm nearly a bachelors, and I've learned from 2 clases in all my time in school...
[10:33:34] <Talow> I was learning more on my own than from the school so I left.
[10:33:36] <peterson_> randomguy1: add the attribute to all img with class lazyload
[10:33:36] <pcfreak30> peterson_: $(this).data('original', $(this).attr('src'));
[10:33:49] <peterson_> ahhh
[10:33:52] <pcfreak30> dont try setting a data-attribute
[10:34:01] <peterson_> of course, jquery stores the data attributes apart from attributes
[10:34:12] <robertmaxrees> ^ don't use your inspector to confirm .data() calls.
[10:34:12] <pcfreak30> data-* is on load only now generally
[10:34:16] <peterson_> that gotcha got me once last time i ventured into jquery
[10:34:26] <pcfreak30> when setting it doent update the dom
[10:34:29] <pcfreak30> only stores it
[10:34:39] <pcfreak30> data* is for initial load importing
[10:34:45] <peterson_> pcfreak30: oh really? that means i can't do what i want then?
[10:34:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:35:07] <robertmaxrees> you can set .data() after pageload, petersendidit
[10:35:18] <robertmaxrees> * peterson_, i mean
[10:35:28] <pcfreak30> robertmaxrees: Theres another peter so auto complete fails
[10:35:30] <robertmaxrees> you just can't use your DOM inspector to read it.
[10:35:41] <robertmaxrees> pcfreak30 yep ;)
[10:36:23] <pcfreak30> peterson_: Also dont assume we can help without an explanation. No internet mind reading invested yet
[10:36:31] <pcfreak30> invented
[10:36:39] <peterson_> tab fail... right ;)
[10:36:51] <peterson_> i thought it was something blindlingly stupid
[10:37:13] <pcfreak30> Regardless tell us what your doing or we have to waste time guessing
[10:37:30] <pcfreak30> In chrome 31, im trying to test touch events but ontouchend isnt in document?
[10:37:33] <peterson_> i tried using web dev toolbar's view generated source to see the added data to no avail
[10:37:34] <pcfreak30> 41*
[10:37:41] <robertmaxrees> pcfreak30 huh?
[10:37:50] <peterson_> i can't tell if they lazy load or not as it's a series of tiny images!
[10:37:58] <peterson_> maybe i should fade in or soemthing...
[10:37:58] <robertmaxrees> peterson_ yeah, you need to use .data() to read them back out.
[10:38:13] <peterson_> i'm being lazy and just using the lazyload plugin
[10:38:31] <randomguy1> seems appropriate
[10:38:41] <pcfreak30> peterson_: data stores to interval objects on dom element object. attr are only for importing on load.
[10:38:47] <peterson_> i'd imagine the lazyload plugin would want the data-original there during page load
[10:38:54] <pcfreak30> internal*
[10:38:55] <peterson_> ok
[10:39:01] <robertmaxrees> pcfreak30 huh?
[10:39:09] <pcfreak30> robertmaxrees: What?
[10:39:10] <peterson_> tabfail again ;)
[10:39:16] <robertmaxrees> you're phrasing that really awkwardly.
[10:39:33] <Talow> peterson_ when you set the data it's not set to an attrabute.
[10:39:41] <pcfreak30> ^^
[10:39:43] <robertmaxrees> ^ exactly.
[10:39:49] <pcfreak30> Anyone help with touch events?
[10:40:07] <robertmaxrees> pcfreak30 what does your question even mean?  have a fiddle to demonstrate?
[10:40:34] <flexpaint> https://jsfiddle.net/yok2fggp/ how can i make this target only selects of a certain class
[10:40:49] <flexpaint> in a certain class
[10:41:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:41:14] <randomguy1> 'select.class'
[10:41:18] <flexpaint> a div of a certain class
[10:41:28] <randomguy1> no space
[10:41:41] <robertmaxrees> make what target?  i see 40+ lines of code.
[10:41:53] <Talow> ^
[10:41:55] <pcfreak30> robertmaxrees: http://dev.financer.com/sv/. The sliders fail on touch despite the toch punch being loaded. in the emulator on chrome document.ontouchend is not defined
[10:42:23] <flexpaint> the first, it does select option of everything on the page
[10:42:28] <robertmaxrees> pcfreak30 that's not helpful - replication steps and a fiddle would be preferred.
[10:42:37] <flexpaint> i want just the selects in divs of a certain class
[10:42:44] <randomguy1> flexpaint: 'select.red' would find selects with a class of red
[10:42:47] <robertmaxrees> flexpaint $('.className').each(function() {
[10:43:01] <robertmaxrees> don't include the tagname if you can.
[10:43:50] <pcfreak30> robertmaxrees: Just try to use the slider in chrome emulator and see that that wont move. Look st source, search for punch and see the js is loaded. Doesnt seem to work on a iphone 5 either
[10:44:25] <flexpaint> robertmaxrees, how would i write it out?
[10:44:36] <flexpaint> i tried this https://jsfiddle.net/yok2fggp/1/
[10:44:42] <robertmaxrees> flexpaint i just showed you how...
[10:44:59] <flexpaint> idk what im doing
[10:45:02] <robertmaxrees> flexpaint $('.test').each(function(){
[10:45:13] <robertmaxrees> insead of $('select').each(function() {
[10:45:16] <randomguy1> his example has test on the outer div
[10:45:27] <randomguy1> flexpaint: try '.text > select' in your example
[10:45:27] <flexpaint> i need it to be of ones in a div not of a class
[10:45:32] <robertmaxrees> oh you only want selects that are children of .test
[10:45:32] <flexpaint> ohh okay nice
[10:45:43] <robertmaxrees> $('.test select').each(function(){ would work, too.
[10:46:07] <robertmaxrees> pcfreak30 yeah, could you maybe make an isolated test case instead?
[10:46:11] <flexpaint> thanks
[10:46:12] <flexpaint> that was it
[10:47:24] <robertmaxrees> pcfreak30 i also don't see any carousels or sliders on that page, so i have no idea what you're talking about.
[10:50:41] <samssh> If you need a function to accept a selector or a Jquery Object, is the standard to just wrap the input in $()?
[10:51:41] <randomguy1> samssh: would be a safe bet
[10:52:40] <robertmaxrees> samssh rely on one or the other.
[10:53:16] <gambl0re> let me tell you, if you want to be successful in this world, you have to have a business mind.
[10:53:21] <robertmaxrees> passing stuff back through $() is kind of hacky and can cause some funky memory problems if you're not carefuly.
[10:53:30] <randomguy1> huh?
[10:53:39] <robertmaxrees> *careful
[10:54:20] <randomguy1> robertmaxrees: i think he was meaning just for usage like function(input) { var $input = $(input); //use it }
[10:54:40] <robertmaxrees> right - if input is already a jquery object, don't pass it back through.
[10:54:45] <samssh> What's the 'quick check' to test if an object is a jquery object?
[10:55:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue you should require a selector or an object.
[10:55:34] <robertmaxrees> instead of allowing both.  makes the contract of the function easier to reason about.
[10:55:49] <samssh> Even if I did require the jquery object, I'd like to check that it is one.
[10:56:04] <samssh> *a jquery
[10:56:07] <robertmaxrees> thing instanceOf jQuery
[10:56:14] <pcfreak30> robertmaxrees: http://i.imgur.com/pyfXIi6.png you dont see that? is there a page with a email sign up instead?
[10:56:22] <samssh> Thanks
[10:56:26] <robertmaxrees> pcfreak30 i get the signup page instead.
[10:56:34] <robertmaxrees> could you make anb isolated test case in a fiddle?
[10:58:51] <pcfreak30> robertmaxrees: I cant replicate it yet. and I disabled the sign up page now.
[10:59:09] <robertmaxrees> good luck then :)
[10:59:23] <robertmaxrees> unless you're saying that when you put it in a fiddle, the issue isn't there.
[11:07:24] <peterson_> does blade still not allow template vars?
[11:07:41] <peterson_> e.g. for 'for; loops
[11:09:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:10:14] <peterson_> sorry, wrong channel ;)
[11:10:22] <robertmaxrees> fair enough!
[11:10:26] <peterson_> blade, laravel's template engine
[11:10:29] <robertmaxrees> ah
[11:10:29] <claytonzaugg> Is it possible to append to DATA after an ajax get request, before the success runs its course?
[11:10:44] <peterson_> i've been fighting with drupal for too long to the point drupal is just a joke
[11:10:57] <randomguy1> peterson_: your two timing on our channel?!?! *tear*
[11:11:00] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg afaik, no, and even if it were I'd highly suggest you not do that.
[11:11:23] <peterson_> sorry randomguy1... i just want more in life... if you know what i mean
[11:11:47] <randomguy1> peterson_: what about the children() ?!
[11:11:58] <randomguy1> sorry
[11:11:58] <claytonzaugg> Okay robertmaxrees, let me ask you then, what would you recommend I do if I am trying to load a template file, update it with new data, then put the template into the main index page?
[11:12:02] * peterson_ facepalms
[11:12:11] <peterson_> lol
[11:12:30] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg call a function that does the update, when then calls a function that puts it into the page.
[11:13:30] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done(buildTemplate);  then buildTemplate would call updatePage and pass it the template info.
[11:13:31] <claytonzaugg> so the success would be update the template, then run the function that places it into the index page?
[11:13:43] <claytonzaugg> Ahhh
[11:13:46] <claytonzaugg> okay thakn you sir!
[11:13:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:15:50] <Danillo10> https://jsfiddle.net/9LLpgzrw/2/ i need effect only in ul:hover actual...can any help?
[11:16:41] <robertmaxrees> what effect?
[11:16:48] <robertmaxrees> also, that's not valid html.
[11:17:15] <Danillo10> robertmaxrees: why?
[11:17:16] <randomguy1> hehe, hovering over the bottom one causes them to dance up and down
[11:17:26] <robertmaxrees> Danillo10 you cannot have <a> as a direct child of <ul>
[11:17:31] <pauled> Hi, I am getting this error: 'Uncaught TypeError: title.text is not a function' in http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/d4ytmbv6/
[11:17:33] <robertmaxrees> you can only have <li> as a direct child of <ul>
[11:17:59] <pauled> 2 hours I am on it I don't find what error is
[11:18:00] <robertmaxrees> pauled .text() only works in jquery objects.
[11:18:32] <robertmaxrees> var title = document.querySelector('title'); needs to be var title = $('title');
[11:18:56] <arc_> Danillo10 what is happening that you don't want to happen
[11:18:58] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I tried both
[11:19:12] <robertmaxrees> try it again.
[11:19:22] <arc_> i'm guessing you only want one of them to animate when you hover
[11:19:25] <arc_> but they all are
[11:20:54] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, what about beforeSend?
[11:21:10] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg that's stuff to run before the request is sent to the server.
[11:21:20] <robertmaxrees> do NOT try to edit the response before you work with it.
[11:21:25] <robertmaxrees> that's a really terrible idea.
[11:21:28] <claytonzaugg> okay
[11:22:44] <Danillo10> arc_: i need the toggle in only one ul(this)
[11:22:53] <robertmaxrees> Danillo10 fix your html first.
[11:23:13] <Danillo10> robertmaxrees: i remove <a>
[11:23:28] <robertmaxrees> and you want $(this).find('li').slideToggle();
[11:23:39] <arc_> Danillo10 https://jsfiddle.net/9LLpgzrw/5/
[11:23:42] <Danillo10> https://jsfiddle.net/9LLpgzrw/6/
[11:23:55] <pauled> thanks robertmaxrees :)
[11:24:23] <robertmaxrees> Danillo10 sorry, let me clarify: the ONLY valid child of a <ul> is <li>.
[11:24:26] <pauled> I am close to find whaat is wrong in that code
[11:24:34] <robertmaxrees> not text, not links, etc.
[11:24:49] <Danillo10> robertmaxrees: ok
[11:24:49] <arc_> i did $(this).children('li').slideToggle(); . is it better to use find()?
[11:25:12] <robertmaxrees> .find() is more "heavy handed" and assumes there aren't nested lists.
[11:25:24] <BillCriswell> the 'li' is useless unless you have non li children in your list.. which you shouldn't.
[11:25:34] <robertmaxrees> ^ exactly.
[11:25:40] <robertmaxrees> .children() would be fine in that case.
[11:25:45] <arc_> well, yeah. i was just working with his html
[11:26:04] <Danillo10> it's wrong menu
[11:26:07] <Danillo10> try run
[11:26:10] <Danillo10> with $(this).children('li').slideToggle();
[11:26:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:26:24] <Danillo10> too $(this).children('li').slideToggle();
[11:26:29] <Danillo10> try run
[11:26:31] <arc_> Danillo10 i pasted a fiddle update for you
[11:26:42] <arc_> it works like it seems it should, but i don't necessarily know what you are trying to do
[11:26:58] <arc_> the problem is that the way you're doing it requires invalid html
[11:27:22] <arc_> you need a different element to be the hover element
[11:27:34] <Danillo10> arc_: if i "hover" the first ul
[11:27:43] <Danillo10> others ul's come to bottom
[11:27:53] <robertmaxrees> that's because of your CSS>
[11:27:54] <arc_> yes you need vertical-align: top; in ul css
[11:28:01] <arc_> i added that in my updated fiddle
[11:28:24] <Danillo10> i will try wait
[11:28:49] <Danillo10> i will try wait
[11:29:01] <Danillo10> nice!
[11:29:06] <Danillo10> tnx arc_  robertmaxrees
[11:29:12] <arc_> is <lh> ever used anymore?
[11:30:01] <robertmaxrees> that's pre html4 iirc.
[11:30:05] <arc_> wow
[11:30:23] <Danillo10> arc_: robertmaxrees  it's my first menu!
[11:30:49] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I don't see why it return noticeRegex as null here http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/d4ytmbv6/
[11:30:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, never even made it to recommendation status, arc_
[11:31:13] <arc_> i was looking for a way to make a list header for <ul>
[11:31:22] <arc_> but i guess the best thing to do would be to just make the first li have a class
[11:31:35] <robertmaxrees> arc_ or put a heading right before the ul.
[11:31:49] <arc_> yeah but then it's more complicated to select the submenu items
[11:32:04] <robertmaxrees> err.
[11:32:11] <robertmaxrees> you wrap everything in a parent container and work off of that.
[11:32:29] <robertmaxrees> pauled because your .match() isn't matching anbything.
[11:33:05] <pauled> why It worked in a simplified example
[11:33:45] <robertmaxrees> because your regex is bad,
[11:33:54] <pauled> nevermind, I found why
[11:34:00] <pauled> because $ at end
[11:34:05] <pauled> thanks :)
[11:34:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:34:08] <pauled> strange
[11:34:14] <pauled> but strange
[11:34:18] <robertmaxrees> not strange.
[11:34:28] <pauled> the '!' is in end of line
[11:34:30] <robertmaxrees> there's a bunch of whitespace at the end of that text.
[11:34:36] <robertmaxrees> no it's not.
[11:35:10] <robertmaxrees> there's a ton of whitespace after the exclamation point.
[11:35:19] <pauled> it see it inline?
[11:35:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:36:14] <robertmaxrees> you original could work if you used the m flag.
[11:36:46] <pauled> I mean the code is saw in one line like? like <div>....<div>..</div>..</div> instead
[11:36:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:37:06] <pauled> lol sorry, trouble to explain
[11:37:39] <pauled> currently the div contain 4 lines
[11:38:11] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/ocoizV9.png
[11:38:12] <pauled> or 5, depend of which line you start to count
[11:39:59] <robertmaxrees> also: this isn't how you use jsfiddle.
[11:42:45] <pauled> my console show me one line http://i.imgur.com/uoWgOr7.png
[11:43:06] <robertmaxrees> is that with the old code?
[11:43:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:43:22] <robertmaxrees> that's the new version.
[11:43:28] <pauled> yes, only add console.log (secs)
[11:43:40] <robertmaxrees> right, the old version was what was broken.
[11:43:48] <robertmaxrees> you're console logging the wrong thing.
[11:43:56] <robertmaxrees> i was just looking at that text pre-regex
[11:45:28] <pauled> is the fault of console or code?
[11:45:36] <robertmaxrees> ... code.
[11:45:39] <robertmaxrees> you're not logging the coirrect thing.
[11:45:54] <pauled> which?
[11:46:05] <robertmaxrees> do console.log(notice.eq(0).text());
[11:46:08] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[11:46:43] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d4ytmbv6/3/ this version should make it abundantly clear.
[11:47:31] <pauled> true I get "You have 15 seconds to make your first move!" with many white space
[11:47:47] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:47:57] <robertmaxrees> that's why the $ wasn't working in the regex before.
[11:53:48] <pauled> yeah, but in code html is in one line
[11:54:21] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet you it's not actually one line ;)
[11:54:59] <pauled> I mean is not break on many line, like:
[11:55:03] <pauled> You have 15 seconds
[11:55:09] <pauled> to make your first move!
[11:55:09] <scrandaddy> Hey there. I have a div set to display: none; Is there any reason that $('#mydiv').show() wouldn't work?
[11:55:27] <robertmaxrees> scrandaddy a parent element is also display: none;?
[11:56:31] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: the div itself still has display: none set
[11:56:41] <robertmaxrees> bad selector?
[11:56:59] <pauled> dinner time. thanks robertmaxrees
[12:00:48] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: i think i figured it out
[12:00:54] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[12:01:15] <scrandaddy> using a selector works, i was using the variable i assigned to the div when i created it
[12:01:31] <d4rklit3> how does $(el).data() handle storing functions?
[12:01:35] <scrandaddy> any reason that might not work? i've never had trouble with that before
[12:01:36] <robertmaxrees> then there's a disconnect, scrandaddy
[12:01:41] <d4rklit3> i know it will do it, but is it expensive?
[12:01:43] <robertmaxrees> scrandaddy i'd have to see an example.
[12:01:54] <robertmaxrees> d4rklit3 ish, especially in olde rbrowsers.
[12:02:10] <d4rklit3> i see that plugins do this
[12:02:18] <robertmaxrees> d4rklit3 that doesn't make it a good idea ;)
[12:02:29] <d4rklit3> well im storing like a tweenmax instance
[12:02:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:03:05] <robertmaxrees> are you storing a function, or something else?
[12:03:08] <d4rklit3> its a function
[12:03:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that.
[12:03:17] <d4rklit3> tweenmax is animation
[12:03:26] <d4rklit3> even if what im making is for ie11+
[12:03:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:03:43] <robertmaxrees> it's called .data(), not .anythingYouMightWant()
[12:04:45] <d4rklit3> so like lets say i have a dom element that is taken by an instance of some object that gives it a bunch of interactivity or whatnot, I just want to store that instance on the element.data()
[12:04:53] <d4rklit3> because its very convienient to get that
[12:05:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not what .data() is meant to do.
[12:05:01] <d4rklit3> convenient**
[12:05:42] <robertmaxrees> feel free to do it, but .data() is more meant to hold data, not functions or applications.
[12:06:15] <d4rklit3> my goal is to store the instance on the dom element
[12:06:24] <d4rklit3> data seems to be a convenient api to do so
[12:06:33] <robertmaxrees> right, and i'm saying that your goal is a bad idea :)
[12:06:39] <d4rklit3> i could technically just do $(el)[0].ns.instance ?
[12:07:00] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't even do that personally.  but that's just me.
[12:07:15] <d4rklit3> explain?
[12:07:40] <robertmaxrees> don't store functions "in nodes"
[12:07:43] <d4rklit3> would you just set a variable in the controller that manages your modules and store in that array
[12:07:49] <d4rklit3> or map
[12:07:59] <robertmaxrees> *array, since we don't really have maps.
[12:08:14] <robertmaxrees> unless you have ES6 available.
[12:08:31] <d4rklit3> babel.js
[12:08:34] <d4rklit3> heh
[12:08:37] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you could use a map.
[12:09:11] <robertmaxrees> you could also just use an object instead of you wanted.  totally depends on the use case.
[12:09:58] <d4rklit3> im reading some SO stuff, for sake of performance it doesn't matter since jquery.data api uses plain old objects anyways
[12:10:12] <robertmaxrees> except for old IE ;)
[12:10:13] <d4rklit3> its really just about coherant design
[12:10:21] <d4rklit3> old IE isn't an issue for what im doing
[12:10:23] <d4rklit3> and never will be
[12:10:28] <robertmaxrees> but yes, in this case, i'd argue storing logic within the DOM is a bad idea.
[12:10:29] <d4rklit3> IE11+
[12:10:42] <robertmaxrees> wow - interesting target audience.
[12:11:07] <d4rklit3> we are digital marketing agency
[12:11:10] <Fogest> I have a cell in a table users can choose to edit by pressing a button which converts it to an input box. I only want them to be able to edit part of the cells content. Should I store the part I don't want them to edit in data() and then add it back to the end of the cell when they hit save, or is there a better way to hide the data and readd it?
[12:11:11] <d4rklit3> err
[12:11:13] <d4rklit3> not marketing
[12:11:21] <d4rklit3> more like design/development
[12:11:34] <d4rklit3> we are making our own site and we hate IE and don't feel like w need to stupport IE9
[12:11:39] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[12:11:49] <d4rklit3> IE10 market share is so low that its not even possible to buy a computer with it installed
[12:11:55] <d4rklit3> so IE11 is the standard IE
[12:12:03] <robertmaxrees> d4rklit3 we have to support back to 8 in our industry sooo ;)
[12:12:11] <d4rklit3> we have done apps
[12:12:14] <d4rklit3> that need to support 8
[12:12:18] <d4rklit3> though not recently
[12:12:24] <robertmaxrees> we make enough money off of those users that it's worth it.
[12:12:36] <robertmaxrees> Fogest can you give an examle?
[12:12:40] <robertmaxrees> like... why only part?
[12:12:53] <Fogest> robertmaxrees, sure, I'll give you an example
[12:13:01] <d4rklit3> we do a bunch of advertising shit
[12:13:27] <robertmaxrees> so do we?  lol
[12:13:38] <robertmaxrees> not saying you're unjustified.
[12:13:42] <robertmaxrees> just an interesting choice.  that's all.
[12:15:05] <Fogest> robertmaxrees,I have a table that displays a bunch of DNS information. People should be able to edit things such as mac address, ip, host, etc... They can edit all these fields with our existing code just fine. It essentially takes the text in the cell and converts it to an input box. The problem is that we want to add a link to the Mac Address cell that links to the DNS record in another system. When they hit "edit" we don't want this link in there,
[12:15:05] <Fogest> nor want it to be submitted in the POST via ajax.
[12:15:14] <robertmaxrees> err...
[12:15:21] <robertmaxrees> great - have a jsfiddle?
[12:15:27] <robertmaxrees> or a simplified test case?
[12:16:06] <Fogest> robertmaxrees, Uh it is a pretty complicated datatables table that is here, but I can try to whip together a simple jsfiddle with it :)
[12:16:23] <robertmaxrees> even just a simple table with the basics would be fine.
[12:16:36] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't adding up, basically.
[12:16:40] <Fogest> robertmaxrees, sure :)
[12:16:47] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i have to go soon.
[12:17:48] <Fogest> robertmaxrees, should be fast to create something basic to show you
[12:20:34] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go.  see ya!
[12:21:16] <axilla> hi all, i'm trying to parse through some json data and add it to a javascript object so i can convert it to a json string.. https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/488bd05ddeb7ee61c187
[12:21:25] <randomguy1> woot woot!  i got a question!   Autocomplete: jsfiddle.net/rgrt57Lj  Why is the 'change' event firing if all you do is focus on a field, don't change it, and then blur out of it?
[12:21:42] <axilla> i've got all the data i need, how would I add each term.id to jsonData.terms in the format shown in my gist?
[12:21:46] <axilla> bit stumped on this part
[12:25:52] <DRSK> Is it possible to *force* a reselection in jQuery somehow? I've implemented a lazy load on fullscreen images, unfortunately due to the data-src the "slider" plugin can't set the width/height properly. Ideas?
[12:26:19] <Fogest> I want to when I hit edit on an element, have it not include the extra stuff in the brackets, only the mac address. Here is a sample of the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/vuc586Ln/
[12:26:25] <Fogest> cc: robertmaxrees
[12:30:03] <Boogymanx> Hey guys, I have a jquery mobile question
[12:30:47] <Boogymanx> I have a list that has data-role collapsible
[12:31:24] <Boogymanx> However, when I open this collapsible other elements on the top level of this list get pushed to the side
[12:31:26] <Boogymanx> http://imgur.com/a/W13up
[12:32:15] <Boogymanx> Also in the second image you can see that the first element of the list gets pushed slightly down in comparison to the others
[12:32:17] <Boogymanx> Anyone have a clue?
[12:35:20] <axilla> nevermind all, i got it :)
[12:36:35] <ilhami> hey.
[12:37:34] <ilhami> anyone who knows how to make the data in the rows unhighlightable in datatables?
[12:57:03] <mbwe> ehm for a noob, could somebody tell me how i could replace function updateImage(imageData) {
[12:57:05] <mbwe>    $('<img src="http://development.bsocius.org/images/fimage.jpg" alt="" style="width:680px">')
[12:57:07] <mbwe>    .appendTo(".shadow");
[12:57:09] <mbwe>   };
[12:57:28] <mbwe> hwo i could replace the src with the argument imageData
[13:00:55] <tswartz> mbwe, that's a pretty basic js question. You should go read some tutorials and learn string operators
[13:01:28] <k-joseph> hi guys; how can i get an index of an object property (when object is in an array within another object) For-example; at: http://snag.gy/Bl1q6.jpg  i need a method which i can pass into "1142456400000" and it returns an index 0 in this case!   i have looked into https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/ but seems to be for arrays not embedded in objects
[13:07:23] <mbwe> tswartz: i have the answer, i remove the src and use .append before the .appendTo
[13:08:47] <Talow> k-joseph: check out jQuery.each()
[13:09:14] <tswartz> Eh. Why not  $('<img src="' + imageData + '" alt="" style="width:680px">') ?
[13:10:14] <ilhami> what you want is so basic mbwe :)
[13:10:37] <Talow> isn't coming here to learn part of the goal?
[13:10:59] <tswartz> Learn, sure. Learning the very simple basics that you should get from any sort of starter tutorial? Not really
[13:15:51] <decx> k-joseph you dont need jquery for that
[13:17:10] <k-joseph> decx: what do i need, am just trying to write javascript method that makes use of logic to of inversion of normal actions to provide a solution to it
[13:18:54] <decx> k-joseph: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/p605z401/
[13:20:28] <decx> any other loop will also do if you want to break at the first hit
[13:21:17] <Fogest> I want to when I hit edit on an element, have it not include the extra stuff in the brackets, only the mac address. Here is a sample of the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/vuc586Ln/
[13:32:08] <CrysAk> Helps: I'm having problems when including more than 1 javascrip/jquery plugins...they seem to conflict and  throw errors such as "**** is not a function" http://paste.ofcode.org/7VcTysDG9swjS9vBzZvgiM
[13:33:09] <decx> what's that location stuff that you load first
[13:33:35] <CrysAk> it's a search plugin that autocompletes / offers suggestions
[13:33:54] <decx> load it after jquery and jquery ui maybe
[13:35:20] <CrysAk> hmm i think i'm missing a src on my actual script part
[13:35:26] <CrysAk> can you add multiple srcs?
[13:35:49] <CrysAk> http://paste.ofcode.org/3aXUcphWYpq5ESYhEZtmvss
[13:36:01] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[13:37:50] <CrysAk> hmm
[13:38:12] <CrysAk> I;ve tried re-ordering and even adding them in the <body>when needed but still either throws error for location javascript or the date/time stuff
[13:38:32] <CrysAk> isthere anything I can edit in the files themselves to make them work together?
[13:47:28] <Seanmcn> Is it possible to pass jQuery UI into jQuery manually?
[13:49:19] <Seanmcn> I'm trying to do an embedable widget that loads up dependencies on the page its embedded on, everything works except jQuery-UI which is undefined. I'm having to pass jQuery over as a variable, wondering if can do the same with jquery-ui or?
[13:53:47] <Lencl> hello
[13:54:30] <Lencl> I have an element that often times element B is a parent or a grandparent or a great great great grandparent, etc.
[13:54:55] <Lencl> but what I know for sure is it has an ID called "rightcontent"
[13:55:01] <Lencl> do I use .find() for that?
[13:55:11] <tash> hello, can someone point me to a nice jquery calendar widget that I can try using?
[13:56:10] <tash> I didn't see anything other thatn 'datepicker' on the official widget page
[13:57:21] <ryanneufeld> tash: What does the datepicker do/not do that you need?
[13:57:46] <CrysAk> dzscalendar is nice
[13:58:16] <tash> I want a calendar view, without clicking in the box to populate the calendar. I also need to be able to add an href to each date
[14:02:30] <tash> CrysAk: do you use dzscalendar?
[14:03:20] <CrysAk> yea, old site: http://driveaddiction.com
[14:03:20] <tash> am curious to know if each of the dates can href to something like /blah.php?date={{the date you are clicking}}
[14:03:56] <CrysAk> yea, you should be abloe to
[14:04:08] <CrysAk> although I'm aweful at jquery, stuck myself atm on soemthing :/
[14:04:23] <tash> anyone else know of any other jq calendar widgets I could look at that you have used and would suggest?
[14:09:01] <CrysAk> Helps still : anyway to stop this conflict.. caused by loading 2 other jquery scripts after (if i re-arrange hte order, it jsut brakes the other scripts) http://paste.ofcode.org/nATBXS3pmuxaFuHP55vSdR
[14:21:19] <bluesnow> If I have a <a href="..." id="href_id">  and do $('#href_id).click(function (event) ... event.preventDefault(); window.location.href = $(event.target).attr('href') })
[14:21:32] <bluesnow> This should set the window's URL to the href of the <a href> tag, right?
[14:21:44] <bluesnow> It's not working correctly for some reason
[14:25:39] <pcfreak30> bluesnow: please make a fiddle of the code
[14:26:25] <pcfreak30> bluesnow: http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html
[14:27:28] <bluesnow> pcfreak30: Okay, I'll make a fiddle of the code. Give me a sec.
[14:30:32] <tash> I'd like to set an href on each date in the jquery ui datepicket ( using Display inline ). Anyone know how to do that? Maybe its in the docs, but I haven't found it yet. http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#inline
[14:30:51] <bluesnow> how do I save and share a jsfiddle o.o
[14:31:20] <pcfreak30> bluesnow: top press save
[14:31:23] <pcfreak30> then give url
[14:31:40] <tash> s/datepicket/datepicker
[14:32:02] <pcfreak30> tash: Why a href?
[14:32:34] <bluesnow> pcfreak30: Pressing save just refreshes the screen for me. Let me do a pastebin
[14:33:02] <pcfreak30> bluesnow: yes then look at the url
[14:33:16] <pcfreak30> it will change and you can share it
[14:34:12] <bluesnow> pcfreak: No, as in it refreshed without changing the URL at all. I've made a pastebin here http://pastebin.com/HhWL8akt
[14:34:15] <Seanmcn> jQuery-UI and jQuery.noConflict().. Is this just totally broken?
[14:34:33] <pcfreak30> tash: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/ or look at source code and override widget with widget factory and add your own stuff
[14:35:11] <tash> pcfreak30: well, I'm trying to replace a very very old and crusty calendar that someone else wrote with this.  The behavior in the current calendar is that each date, when clicked, opens something like page.php?date=whateverDateYouClick
[14:36:52] <bluesnow> pcfreak30: When I click on the "Delete this article" href in the top half of that pastebin, it does not go to the href's href attribute
[14:37:11] <nerium> How do I jump to a specific element using jquery?
[14:37:13] <pcfreak30> bluesnow: return false;
[14:37:26] <bluesnow> at the bottom of the js function?
[14:37:36] <pcfreak30> need both preventDefault and false
[14:37:54] <pcfreak30> preventDefault is generally for parent items, return false is for the link
[14:38:06] <bluesnow> oh right obviously at the bottom, since otherwise it would return before doing anything >.>
[14:38:09] <bluesnow> okay, thanks
[14:39:23] <pcfreak30> nvm bluesnow still isnt doing it and logically it should
[14:39:52] <bluesnow> pcfreak30: o.o hmm
[14:40:08] <pcfreak30> tash: Use a css selector to bind to the items, and use on so it monitors the page
[14:40:45] <pcfreak30> tash: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:41:13] <pcfreak30> tash1: "Direct and delegated events"
[14:43:13] <nerium> Any idea how this can be done?scrollTop doesn’t seam to work
[14:43:27] <tash1> thanks will try later, gotta run to a meeting
[14:43:55] <pcfreak30> nerium: fiddle please
[14:44:59] <robertmaxrees> nerium scrollTop() does work.
[14:45:19] <nerium> It seams to work in fiddle, but not on my page
[14:45:45] <pcfreak30> ok then your page has a different issue then
[14:45:46] <robertmaxrees> *seems
[14:45:54] <robertmaxrees> and do you have any console errors on your page?
[14:47:22] <bluesnow> pcfreak30: Any idea why it's not working?
[14:48:31] <bluesnow> pcfreak30: The href attribute on the href tag itself works fine (it works when the page is not fully loaded and when the confirm dialog does not appear).
[14:49:09] <bluesnow> pcfreak30: But jquery on the href kicks in, it fails to set window.location.href correctly
[14:49:43] <CrysAk> NO CONFLICTTTT solved my issues :D
[14:49:47] <CrysAk> ta for help
[14:52:10] <pcfreak30> bluesnow: seems if preventDefault it goes to the url. only use return false
[14:53:12] <bluesnow> pcfreak30: But won't the href be accessed then regardless of whether the user clicks "Ok" on the confirm box?
[14:53:25] <bluesnow> jquery confuses me :(
[14:53:28] <robertmaxrees>  return false; will run event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault();
[14:53:59] <bluesnow> ah I see
[14:54:07] <robertmaxrees> so what's the problem?
[14:54:19] <bluesnow> okay, this should work then. thanks, let me check.
[14:57:26] <bluesnow> nope, that doesn't fix it
[14:57:35] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[14:58:29] <bluesnow> robertmaxrees: I have a link that when clicked, I want to prevent the href from being accessed. I want a confirm box to show up first, and then only access the href if the user clicks 'ok' on the confirm box. See the code at http://pastebin.com/HhWL8akt
[14:58:55] <bluesnow> So for some reason, even after the user clicks 'ok' on the confirm box, the code does not change the window's href to the "Delete this article" href
[14:59:19] <robertmaxrees> works in a fiddle.
[14:59:27] <bluesnow> o.o
[14:59:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sp2zjho1/
[14:59:34] <robertmaxrees> so there's something else going on with your page.
[15:00:22] <bluesnow> how can you tell it works in a fiddle if the window's href is not being set?
[15:00:27] <bluesnow> (sorry for being a jquery noob)
[15:00:50] <robertmaxrees> the frame changes the URL.
[15:01:55] <robertmaxrees> also: event.target is not what you want there.
[15:02:21] <bluesnow> robertmaxrees: What should I use instead?
[15:02:27] <robertmaxrees> $(this)
[15:03:22] <robertmaxrees> your markup is structured in a way that makes event.target the span, not the a.
[15:03:37] <bluesnow> Oh I see. That's probably causing the bug I guess
[15:03:44] <robertmaxrees> that's definitely causing the bug.
[15:03:58] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with the console?
[15:04:03] <bluesnow> yes
[15:04:25] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sp2zjho1/1/
[15:04:26] <robertmaxrees> check this out.
[15:04:34] <bluesnow> er wait, which span?
[15:04:44] <bluesnow> I don't even see a span in the HTML I pasted
[15:04:52] <robertmaxrees> err, the strong tag.
[15:04:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sp2zjho1/2/ is fixed btw.
[15:04:58] <bluesnow> ah okay
[15:05:08] <robertmaxrees> you have a child element of the anchor tags - that's what matters.
[15:05:23] <bluesnow> oh right, that makes sense
[15:05:27] <bluesnow> okay thanks
[15:05:33] <bluesnow> I should still use $(this), right?
[15:06:04] <pcfreak30> bluesnow: events are proxied to the target
[15:06:13] <pcfreak30> so .click cb this == a tag
[15:06:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah - my last fiddle illustrates my point if you open your console.
[15:06:38] <bluesnow> ok, thanks
[15:07:21] <robertmaxrees> covered here: http://api.jquery.com/on/#event-handler
[15:07:34] <bluesnow> robertmaxrees: Ah right. I should have thought to use console.log to debug this
[15:07:41] <robertmaxrees> the last paragraph (the one right before "passing data to the handler)
[15:07:47] <bluesnow> ok
[15:07:52] <bluesnow> I will take a look at that
[15:10:30] <Talow> @bluesnow: console.log($(this).attr('href'));
[15:10:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:10:47] <bluesnow> yeah xD
[15:10:53] <robertmaxrees> or just console.log(this) ;)
[15:11:01] <robertmaxrees> see if you even have the right element.
[15:11:40] <Talow> wow I'm slow
[15:43:43] <Lencl> There's a block of text that I'm looking to find its parent. Sometimes the parent is one level up or sometimes two levels (grandparent)... but it has id "rightcontent"
[15:44:54] <robertmaxrees> .closest()
[15:46:48] <Lencl> ah, thank you
[16:05:10] <pauled> robertmaxrees: getting another error: "Uncaught NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'observe' on 'MutationObserver': The provided node was null." in http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/d4ytmbv6/
[16:05:40] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:06:50] <pauled> what mean node? title?
[16:07:09] <robertmaxrees> it's complaining about observer.observe(target, config);
[16:07:25] <robertmaxrees> target is a jquery object, not a plain node.
[16:12:54] <pauled> what you mean, I should use pure js queryselector?
[16:13:07] <robertmaxrees> that'll probably break other code (like it did earlier ;) )
[16:13:19] <robertmaxrees> you need to access the underlying DOM node.
[16:13:33] <robertmaxrees> usually you do that with [0] on the end of the object - target[0]
[16:14:12] <pauled> there is 2 title, so I select the right one with .eq(1)
[16:14:44] <robertmaxrees> you cannot have multiple title tags.
[16:14:55] <robertmaxrees> and i'm not talking about var target = $('title').eq(1);
[16:15:00] <robertmaxrees> oi'
[16:15:10] <robertmaxrees> *i'm talking about observer.observe(target[0], config);
[16:18:37] <pauled> thanks, no error, but now I don't see the next console.log("target #2: " + target.text());
[16:18:58] <robertmaxrees> there isn't another console.log() in there.
[16:20:48] <pauled> line 26
[16:20:53] <robertmaxrees> you mean inside the observe callback?
[16:20:58] <pauled> yes
[16:21:07] <robertmaxrees> setup a reduced test case for just the observer then.
[16:21:10] <robertmaxrees> let's play with it.
[16:37:42] <pauled> ah ok, I see it if I modify the <title/>
[16:39:47] <pauled> I have to think how to use that in only one case
[16:41:18] <pauled> Probably tomorrow, now I have to go to bed. Good night robertmaxrees. Thank you for the help.
[16:50:50] <vivekananda> hey everyone. got a question. I found that post-request-get is an acceptable choice for logins. Currently I have a "googleLoginCallback" jquery function and I end up getting login confirmation in it ( via ajax). Now I want the page to display 'logged in' but I cannot find a way to "POST" to the same page and then refresh the page.
[16:51:08] <vivekananda> or implement prg with my flow.
[16:52:02] <vivekananda> I am looking at this example and trying to use it or similar for my workflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7214860/printing-a-php-error-inline-instead-of-erasing-the-entire-page/7215138#7215138
[16:52:51] <robertmaxrees> that's a PHP question.
[16:53:21] <snover> i thought the q in jquery stood for php
[16:53:27] <gtwy> this is where you are going wrong
[16:53:28] <robertmaxrees> lols
[16:53:35] <gtwy> but I cannot find a way to "POST" to the same page and then refresh the page.
[16:53:39] <gtwy> that doesnt make any sense
[16:53:45] <gtwy> the whole reason to use AJAX is so that you dont have to reload the page
[16:53:46] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:53:51] <robertmaxrees> wait is this the same person ooor...?
[16:53:53] <gtwy> on a success() of the ajax
[16:54:14] <robertmaxrees> you use the success to fill a hidden form and post the data.
[16:54:15] <rcyr> post/redirect/get is for normal form logins AFAIK
[16:54:31] <rcyr> That doesn't make any sense for ajax logins.
[16:54:38] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[16:54:41] <gtwy> you would simply do $('#elementForLoginDIV').text('logged in');
[16:55:00] <gtwy> im confused who is talking to who
[16:55:04] <gtwy> i was quoting vivekananda
[16:55:11] <robertmaxrees> are you vivekananda?
[16:55:17] <vivekananda> gtwy, yeah precisely. My ajax get the new data ( ie vivekanada is logged in). gtwy hmm .
[16:55:20] <gtwy> obviously not
[16:55:22] <gtwy> my name says gtwy
[16:55:23] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[16:55:30] <robertmaxrees> for a second i thought they were using two different accounts.
[16:55:52] <gtwy> vivekananda: ok so you get the data that the login was sucessful
[16:55:56] <gtwy> vivekananda: what do you want to happen next
[16:55:57] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, no I use either vivekanada or karpuragauram. Both quite distinguishing
[16:56:15] <vivekananda> gtwy, I want the page to display it but I have a problem.
[16:56:22] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda either way, you just set an element's .text() to say "logged in" or whatever.
[16:56:48] <vivekananda> lemme ask my question and hope I make it clear
[16:56:56] <gtwy> ok
[16:57:04] <gtwy> be ready to paste some code into a pastebin or jsfiddle
[16:57:12] <gtwy> cause im going to be limited in helping without seeing
[16:57:53] <vivekananda> gtwy, I also am relatively certain this is more of a design question than an actual code one hence I guess you might be able to gimme advice without looking but lets see
[16:58:03] <gtwy> sure
[17:01:10] <vivekananda> so my page has html+php. now in the php I have clauses saying ' if ($display_login == true) {show html section 1} else{ show section 2}. What I wanted to do is, when the jquery callback gets ' vivekananda is logged in' I just go ahead and make $display_login == true and just refresh the page. But my question is, is this very higly coupled code and hence not a good idea to do this ?
[17:01:42] <vivekananda> makes any sense ?
[17:02:16] <gtwy> reading now
[17:02:46] <gtwy> if you are going to do it that way
[17:02:50] <gtwy> just skip the ajax and reload the entire page
[17:02:57] <gtwy> just post your form
[17:03:03] <gtwy> and catch the input with <?php >
[17:03:12] <gtwy> otherwise take the html code for section 1
[17:03:14] <gtwy> and put it into your JS
[17:03:29] <gtwy> so that when you get the "success" back on the ajax
[17:03:40] <gtwy> you can change the page right then and there
[17:04:38] <gtwy> vivekananda: https://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/kxj7et6w/1/
[17:04:39] <vivekananda> gtwy, reading
[17:04:53] <vivekananda> but before I do, did my question make sense ?
[17:05:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:05:05] <robertmaxrees> he answered you didn't he?
[17:05:10] <gtwy> yeah it sounds like every other person who has ever created a login form
[17:05:26] <gtwy> jsfiddle should tell you everything you need
[17:05:32] <vivekananda> gtwy, okay
[17:05:54] <gtwy> if you have questions about whats happening there please let me know
[17:06:01] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, yeah but sometimes I write convoluted english and it doesn't make sense but decent people don't point it out :)
[17:06:08] <vivekananda> gtwy, of course
[17:06:14] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda they answered you in this case pretty clearly ;)
[17:06:21] <vivekananda> true
[17:14:34] <vivekananda> gtwy, will have to go with the js approach coz I will surely have the jquery/js call back function for google login button. I cannot escape that
[17:18:01] <vivekananda> gtwy, have two more questions. 1. if I have more than one ( say 3 sections) for a logged in user ( eg user favorite blogs , user frieds names , user recipes) would I take each of those inside jquery and change each or is there a better way ? ( eg have a separate index.php and a loggedInIndex.php ?   2. if I use js and get html in there as you suggested isn't an example of coupled code ? I am guessing if I get php inside
[17:18:01] <vivekananda> js that is bad but html is fine but do tell me which is a better design principle
[17:19:10] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:19:23] <robertmaxrees> you can't "get php with js"
[17:19:28] <robertmaxrees> you can get rendered markup.
[17:20:17] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to setup an API to deliver the parts of pages you need.
[17:23:50] <DietDrK> right now I'm using ' $('g.node').click(function () {' to select an SVG element composed of an ellipse, but it only works if the edge of the ellipse is clicked. Any way to make it work on the fill as well?
[17:25:05] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball
[17:25:17] <robertmaxrees> hrm... i can't see your code DietDrK.  interesting.
[17:25:42] <DietDrK> http://pastebin.com/XkfSWT69
[17:26:44] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h6L21p4d/
[17:27:27] <DietDrK> Ahh, forgot about that site. Thanks
[17:28:02] <DietDrK> Anyways, was wondering if there was a way to select the 'inside' of an 'svg > g > ellipse' element.
[17:28:06] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, ummm what I meant is spose I setup a hidden div and give it a value from js. Then I reload the page during which the php reads the hidden div and sees if it has values and changes the page accordingly. I read somewhere that while this is doable, it is not a good idea design wise coz the it is better to have the 3 languages uncoupled ( ie least overalp between php, html and js )
[17:28:56] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda you've lost me.
[17:29:08] <vivekananda> okay
[17:29:45] <robertmaxrees> DietDrK i can't remember actually haha.
[17:30:59] <robertmaxrees> iirc jquery and svg don't really work correctly.
[17:32:55] <DietDrK> I was thinking about <label>
[17:33:04] <DietDrK> because the purpose of that is to increase click map area, right?
[17:33:13] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember in svgs.
[17:33:21] <robertmaxrees> for html, you can use them for that.
[17:34:41] <DietDrK> Guess I'll go with this: >For each line, try drawing a transparent line on top of it with a larger stroke width, and set the onclick on that.
[17:37:50] <ashgotti> Evening all. I need a bit of help with a simple validation script. It works for the most part. It accepts 9 digits and validates. I want to make it so that if people place dashes, they are stripped out and validated as 9 digits. I can't figure out why it doesn't work though: http://jsfiddle.net/6qwkyapr/
[17:38:18] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:38:21] <ashgotti> You can see that it works if you put 9 straight digits but if you include dashes it doesn't. when I console.log the code, it does look like it's stripping properly
[17:38:51] <robertmaxrees> ashka is this just trying to make sure you only input 9 numbers into a field?
[17:39:12] <robertmaxrees> err, ashgotti
[17:39:14] <ashgotti> robertmaxrees: it's validating that it's a valid Canadian Social Insurance Number
[17:39:35] <DietDrK> would this style help me achieve my goal? Can CSS increase the stroke-width? view-source:http://xn--dahlstrm-t4a.net/svg/interactivity/hover-invisible-stroke-compat.svg
[17:39:55] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti great - what's a valid canadian SIN?
[17:39:57] <robertmaxrees> 9 numbers?
[17:40:09] <ashgotti> It has to be 9 numbers yes and then there is a formula
[17:40:16] <ashgotti> the standard format is 555-666-777
[17:40:24] <ashgotti> So I want to make it that if the user includes dashes, they are stripped out
[17:40:39] <robertmaxrees> i'm concerned because there's an eval() and a really bizarre line with some bitshifting.
[17:41:00] <robertmaxrees> so i'm trying to wrap my head around the actual problem :)
[17:41:08] <ashgotti> admittedly I didn't write it from scratch. The formula I found on another site.
[17:41:38] <ashgotti> The problem is if you try on jsfiddle entering 555666777, it'll say valid/not valid. If you try 555-666-777 it doesn't validate even though I'm stripping out the dashes
[17:41:42] <vivekananda> to rephrase my questions . 1. Can I change a php variable using jquery and render the page ? 2. Is it a good idea to change and rerender ?
[17:42:05] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda 1. not really. 2. huh?
[17:42:57] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, if 1 is not possible then of course 2 doesn't make sense.
[17:43:14] <vivekananda> no worries I will do it a different way
[17:43:16] <DietDrK> so is there a way to use the technique showed here: http://xn--dahlstrm-t4a.net/svg/interactivity/hover-invisible-stroke-compat.svg in order to give the ID to JS?
[17:44:02] <acidjazz> coool DietDrK
[17:44:06] <acidjazz> css inside hte svg?
[17:44:16] <acidjazz> one kinda looks like a turd
[17:45:05] <DietDrK> this one line is what's making me wonder if it's possible:
[17:45:05] <DietDrK> 		use { pointer-events: all; stroke-width: 40; fill: none; stroke-opacity: 0; }
[17:45:20] <acidjazz> stroke that turd
[18:08:59] <pantsofchocolate> hey jquery people i have a strange question, have any of you run into the problem of using affix and it only works with negative values for the bottom offset?
[18:24:23] <gtwy> vivekananda: not sure where you are at but i just read your question
[18:24:42] <vivekananda> gtwy, yeah I am here.
[18:24:53] <gtwy> you could generate their userpage in your php file and pass the markup back to the ajax
[18:25:09] <gtwy> im guessing youre using JSON to get a response from the php right?
[18:25:11] <gtwy> from the ajax
[18:25:43] <gtwy> if its really so dramatically different for each user
[18:25:53] <gtwy> you could build some kind of html and then pass it back via JSON
[18:26:00] <gtwy> but that is crappy
[18:26:11] <gtwy> the better way to do it would be to establish what variables you need to build it with javascript
[18:26:17] <gtwy> ill give you one example
[18:26:27] <gtwy> lets say you keep track of which user pages users can access
[18:26:33] <gtwy> instead of writing the code with php and passing it back
[18:26:42] <gtwy> you can simply pass back, through JSON, the list of pages they are allowed to see
[18:27:02] <gtwy> so now you get a return of [page1, page2, page3]
[18:27:13] <vivekananda> I was just looking at ways to do this but not compromise speed. I figured, the least amount I manupulate, the faster things would be. The other problem I have is the page itself is setup in a way that large chunks of it depend on the boolean values of php variables. So I will have to render those entire sections from ajax ! I would have loved to go the prg way ( ie php only ) but the problem is I am using googlesignIN and
[18:27:13] <vivekananda> that tutorial code uses a js/jquery callback ! :)
[19:11:50] <jsjskkk> Hey i have signups for a forum a guild application and a chat. could i combine that Ingo 1 reg.
[19:50:54] <resio> is async:false in $.ajax deprecated or no?
[19:51:00] <resio> documentation is confusing
[19:53:15] <rcyr> FWIW, Mozilla deprecated sync requests on the main thread for firefox as of FF31
[22:01:46] <kriti> HI...........I need help in understanding the concept behind jQuery.cache[elem[jQuery.expando]]
[22:08:08] <kriti> Hey everyone...need help guys....Replace  elem = elem.nodeType ? jQuery.cache[elem[jQuery.expando]] : elem[jQuery.expando]; with lem = elem[jQuery.expando]; with elem = elem[jQuery.expando]; is acting as a fix

[22:51:23] <drunkenlullaby> anyone here have experience with jquery and bootstrap using scroll spy and affix?
[23:28:02] <sammych1> anyone want to try and reproduce a bug for me?
[23:28:19] <sammych1> you need to be on Chrome 43 (latest)
[23:28:28] <sammych1> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/widgets/popup/index.html
[23:28:54] <sammych1> before I go on...anyone?
[23:32:19] <sammych1> here it is anyway: scroll to the bottom of the linked page.
[23:32:20] <sammych1> Click on 'scaling images'.
[23:32:20] <sammych1> Click on either of the two blue buttons to show a popup.
[23:32:20] <sammych1> Close that popup.
[23:32:20] <sammych1> Click on the 'Back to Popups' back link at the top left.
[23:32:20] <sammych1> About halfway down the page, click on 'Delete page...'
[23:34:02] <sammych1> What happened? Scrolled to the top of the page. Popup isn't in view. Clicking brings you back to the popup, but the curtain is closed. Closing the popup doesn't bring back the scroll bar. Body has classes that haven't been removed
[23:47:56] <E1> need help, copy to clipboard
[23:49:08] <E1> bagaimana caranya div content copy to clipboard using jquery
[23:51:15] <Cork> E1: you can't modify the clipboard unless the user makes a clipboard action (ctrl+c for example)
[23:51:34] <Cork> this isn't a jquery limitation btw
[23:52:47] <sammych1> or use flash *scary ghost noises*
[23:55:08] <E1> isn't any option without using flash ?
[23:55:39] <sammych1> the browser sandbox prevents this. It's for the user's protection
[23:55:46] <Uhkis> one should not mess with users clipboard
[23:56:12] <E1> ok i got it
[23:56:37] <Cork> E1: there is standard work ongoing trying to find sane ways to expose the clipboard without leaking data
[23:56:55] <Cork> but they aren't implemented in browsers currently
[23:57:31] <E1> no support for modern browser
[23:57:38] <Cork> no
[23:57:45] <sammych1> WinJS ;)
[23:57:47] <Cork> http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/clipops/clipops.html#semi-trusted-event
[23:57:55] <sammych1> not really a browser...
[23:58:12] <Cork> so document.execCommand("copy") is going to be possible from click even handlers
[23:58:19] <Cork> but no browser has it implemented yet
[23:58:35] * Uhkis puts on a foilhat
[23:58:36] <Cork> *event handlers
[23:58:40] <E1> ty Cork for your answer
[23:58:42] <Uhkis> i hope no browser ever implements it
[23:58:52] <Cork> Uhkis: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1012662
[23:58:54] <E1> i have one question
[23:58:54] <Cork> :)
[23:59:18] <Cork> Uhkis: the patch is already written
[23:59:42] <Cork> and event went one round of checking-backout
[23:59:59] <Cork> ...
