[00:04:46] <sj26> heikki_: that's sometimes called a fragment, hash or anchor. look at the document.location. there's also the hashchange event--it's not incredibly well supported but polyfills exist
[00:06:53] <heikki_> ok, thanks!
[00:07:22] <ron_weboolu> hello.. question.. does anyone here know what engine is being used to populate the jquery api on their website.?
[00:08:17] <ron_weboolu> i am building i website that is holding similar type of content, basically our api's and was wondering how this documentation is being generated
[00:11:13] <thinced> heikki_, location.hash
[00:11:16] <ron_weboolu> anyone..?
[00:12:09] <codeclarified> ron_weboolu: jquery.com runs on http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki for their documentation
[00:12:54] <ron_weboolu> I am currently using wordpress to store all of this information, but i don't know if it will scale
[00:14:23] <ron_weboolu> ok, so the main site runs on wordpress, and api.jquery.com runs on mediawiki?
[00:15:56] <codeclarified> i may have actually spoken too soon on that... I was actually on docs.jquery.com (all links to the api pages) but not sure if this is just a leftover page from an old system
[00:17:05] <codeclarified> (gotta say I was REALLY confused to see jquery 1.4 included on the page, makes more sense now)
[00:19:23] <Nachtwind> hi.. very short question.. i have a function called "$('#some-id').click(function(){}". How do i call it from code and not from a link?
[00:20:24] <heikki_> Why will this code bring me to the address /^.*#/ http://pastebin.com/fNY56hrm
[00:20:50] <heikki_> i am editing a string, not the addressbar
[00:21:34] <JKarsrud> no
[00:21:41] <JKarsrud> window.location.href is a string
[00:21:59] <heikki_> yes, but i am not editing that
[00:22:00] <JKarsrud> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[00:22:26] <heikki_> the line 6 will get me to an error page saying that The requested URL /^.* was not found on this server.
[00:23:13] <heikki_> ah, ok,
[00:23:24] <heikki_> window.location is an object or something... ok
[00:23:32] <JKarsrud> try editing window.location.href instead, not window.location
[00:23:42] <heikki_> :) Thanks
[00:24:05] <JKarsrud> no problemo :)
[00:24:13] <JKarsrud> you could also call window.location.toString()
[00:31:13] <clear-in> hi
[00:32:09] <aro> has anyone used ben almans method for setting bookmarkable tabs?
[00:42:58] <aloiscochard> good morning everyone
[00:43:11] <aloiscochard> I'm looking for a restful store in jQuery, any pointers?
[00:43:16] <pputman> Hi, I'm trying to use backbone, underscore, and jquery, and I'm getting this error:  Uncaught ReferenceError: JST is not defined.  I am including backbone.js, underscore.js, jquery.js, jquery_ujs and jquery-ui, but nothing, which library should define jst?
[00:43:22] <aloiscochard> (I want the equivalent of ExtJS http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-0/#!/api/Ext.data.JsonStore )
[00:55:55] <aloiscochard> "Or, some wise and prophetic jQuery guru will point me towards a really solid ExtJS-style "store" or "Ext.Direct"-type model that I will fall in love with. Probably, though, I've just started another little mini Apple vs. PC-type war that will populated by haters and defenders" ... from http://www.grantshepert.com/post.cfm/jquery-and-or-extjs
[00:56:09] <aloiscochard> please tell me this isn't true anymore
[01:02:31] <_johnny> hi, is it possible to bind on the event that the css property "display" is changed (display: none for instance)? i'm using jquery mobile for rendering, but it will not trigger pageinit/pageshow/pagecreate when i refresh a certain page, so i thought of hooking the display change instead - if that's possible?
[01:04:28] <WellWisher> is there any jquery script to load a popup box on page load and expire after sometime
[01:15:03] <ura> Hi
[01:15:59] <ura> Is it possible to invalidate jquery request cache? I do need jquery cache most of time, just there are a few cases when I must invalidate it.
[01:16:37] <ura> On server side I'm sending headers, Cache-Control: no-cache, but it does not work.
[01:19:00] <shesek> ura, just add some randomness to the URL
[01:19:39] <mari00> hi all, i'm having a *very* strange problem with an ajax GET request i'm trying to make using jquery.  the call seems never to complete (ie the complete, success, or error functions seem never to run) unless i put an alert fucntion call after the ajax call.
[01:20:07] <ura> That's the "cache" option is doing, but I don't know from javascript side do I need caching. Only server can tell is this request need to be cached or not.
[01:20:52] <ura> (i.e. caching is desired for good responses, but I don't want temporary error responses to be cached)
[01:21:23] <ura> By error responses I don't mean HTTP error responses, just my JSON responses to indicate to user some error.
[01:22:56] <ura> ah, I just realized, I'm using jquery.address plugin, it is not caching issue, it's because address is not updated, all I need is to trigger address change manually :)
[01:41:25] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. Could someone offer some advice on scrolling a really large image (or several images next to each other) REALLY slowly..
[01:42:00] <Whirl3d> I was wondering what the best approach would be: one large image and an .animate call (with a long duration)
[01:42:25] <Whirl3d> or manually manage animation using setInterval?
[01:44:27] <Whirl3d> I see, everybody is away at the moment. Drats.
[01:44:45] <mindis|work> nope. just don't have an answer ;)
[01:45:59] <mari00> hi all, i'm having some trouble with an ajax jquery call that is never completing.  here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/yXzaU/9/.  the only way i can get it to complete is, strangely, if i add an alert function call at the end of the ajax call, as it is in the code i provided.  if i remove that line, it never completes.  i'm quite boggled by thsi problem, so any help would be greatly appreciated!
[01:46:25] <Whirl3d> mindis|work, thanks for the reply, regardless. I don't have a good answer either. LOL
[01:49:25] <Whirl3d> mari00, are you using a jquery plugin to handle the submit function?
[01:50:39] <Anomie21> Anyone know why this bit of code isn't working? (under ''Publishing Accolades' - should pull in a twitter feed). I'm calling jquery using <script src="jquery.min.js"></script>. Am I doing it right? (first time working with jquery) ? http://cravenpublishing.com/
[01:50:58] <Whirl3d> mari00, perhaps you should change your code to $("button[type='submit']").click(function (e) {.....}); instead of handling the submit call.
[01:52:14] <WellWisher> is there any jquery plugin to show auto expiring popup window?
[01:52:21] <mari00> Whirl3d: I'm not sure what you mean by jquery plugin...  What's your thinking behind use the button submit function directly?
[01:53:51] <Whirl3d> I am not an expert, but I didn't know that you could bind the submit function on a form. I always handle the submit button click, override the default form action and handle my form submission.
[01:54:32] <Whirl3d> WellWisher, you can code that yourself....use setTimeout and give it a time to call the close popup method
[01:55:02] <Whirl3d> Anomie21, are you using a "Tweets" plugin? Because I don't see it loaded in your page at first glance...
[01:55:17] <mari00> Whirl3d: Ok...I can see how it would make the whole thing more direct.  On the other hand, the problem here was not that the form submit was not being called, but rather that the ajax call only finished if I have that random alert call after the ajax function...
[01:55:24] <Anomie21> Whirl3d: I'm using the jquery tweet example from jsfiddle
[01:55:36] <mari00> I'm giving your suggestion a try though :)
[01:55:39] <squeakytoy> Hey all. Can anyone recommend a decent XSLT plugin for JQuery? Transform from String to String.
[01:55:51] <Whirl3d> mari00, since we are looking at jsfiddle, I'm not sure if the ajax call ever gets sent....
[01:56:45] <Whirl3d> mari00, if it's never sent (because it's never called, for example) than it would never fail...but again, I don't have any way to verify that it's being called...
[01:57:20] <Anomie21> Whirl3d: I can see the code in the viewsource. Here's a copypasta http://pastebin.com/tSTyGW8c
[01:57:32] <mari00> Whirl3d: I am able to run the code on jsfiddle.  In any case, it is being called.
[01:58:39] <Whirl3d> mari00, The only other thing I would check (with my limited experience) is your declaration of data:'jsonp'  Perhaps you could declare a different data type and get a different result. Any result would be helpful, I guess in troblshooting
[01:58:45] <Whirl3d> *troubleshooting
[01:59:38] <Whirl3d> Anomie21, where do you load the function called "tweet"?
[02:00:03] <Whirl3d> It looks to me like you need to add a link to an external script that handles "tweet" calls.
[02:00:43] <Whirl3d> ?.tweet
[02:00:45] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Who – Tweet Buttom - jQuery Plugin repository - I took the Topsy retweet button and jQuery-fied it, then added the "Who" part to it using the awesome Topsy API . to create this fancy share count button for your stories on twitter. that's it! http://plugins.jquery.com/project/who-tweet-button
[02:01:31] <Whirl3d> ?.submit
[02:01:31] <bot-t> .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[02:04:20] <Anomie21> Whirl3d: I assumed something to handle it was bundled into jquery.min.js as the example on jsfiddle works?
[02:04:48] <mari00> Whirl3d: I think I just found the answer...here: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#api under the submit function I noticed this code "// return false to prevent normal browser submit and page navigation  return false;
[02:05:15] <mari00> ...I guess if you don't return false the browser is waiting for a response object?
[02:05:20] <mari00> So it never completes.
[02:05:28] <Anomie21> Whirl3d: This is the example I used http://jsfiddle.net/pborreli/pJgyu/
[02:05:34] <mari00> I addded return false; to the end of the ajax function and it seems to work...
[02:08:48] <WellWisher> is there idleTimeout method??
[02:09:42] <Whirl3d> Anomie21, here's the deal. If you look in jsFiddle, there's a place where external resources are loaded. You'll see that jquery.tweets.vi  is being loaded. Put that in your header and it should work fine.
[02:10:10] <Anomie21> Whirl3d: Ah, I see. One of the first times using jfiddle aswell, thanks for the help!
[02:10:58] <Whirl3d> WellWisher, idle is such a bag of worms. Do you mean, "no key pressed" or "no mouse activity" or "no scrolling" or "no animation" or "no calculations even" ....cause each of those can be scripted to break a timeOut call
[02:12:07] <Whirl3d> Anomie, np.
[02:12:39] <Whirl3d> squeakytoy, what are you trying to do?
[02:12:47] <alex88> hello all, $('#delete_image_modal_button').unbind('click').bind('click',deleteimage(e)); why is the function called on bind and not click?
[02:12:56] <WellWisher> i just need a popup box appear with some content on page load or on button click and it must expire in timelimit
[02:13:07] <WellWisher> so, i can use setTimeout
[02:13:08] <squeakytoy> Whirl3d: transform an inline XML via XSL, but not through ajax
[02:13:13] <WellWisher> right?
[02:13:34] <nFFF> Can someone tell me if the items per page or sort by at the top of here: http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/staging/index.php/store/bullet-proof-vests.html actually does anything
[02:13:41] <nFFF> For me its just changing the values in the select boxes
[02:13:51] <nFFF> Cant tell if theres something wrong with my comp or the javascript
[02:13:59] <alex88> WellWisher: yup, just run that when you display the popup
[02:14:59] <Whirl3d> WellWisher, you could do something like this: var t=setTimeout(3000, hidepopup) and then in your hidepopup, check to see if a global variable is set....then in your form, whenever there is activity, set the global variable to true. When there isn't set it to false.
[02:15:34] <WellWisher> ok
[02:16:16] <Anomie21> Hmm, still not loading. Is there something wrong with my syntax; http://pastebin.com/S1qUAng3 ?
[02:19:47] <aloiscochard> I desperately looking for something like that http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/quickstart/data/usingdatastores.html in jquery? any current development perhaps?
[02:19:55] <aloiscochard> I would be open to code one myself
[02:20:14] <aloiscochard> ... but I would prefer now if nothing exist yet, or no one is working on this
[02:24:12] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/7uTf2/6/
[02:24:58] <Whirl3d> WellWisher, look at this example: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/7uTf2/6/   I show you how to reset the counter so that you don't hide the window if someone focuses, or enters keystrokes...
[02:25:10] <MrGando> Hey guys, I'm absolutely puzzled by a question that I made in stack overflow about jQuery loading the wrong html via ajax, if someone could take a look at it it would be awesome http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8813888/jquery-loading-wrong-html-via-ajax
[02:26:20] <Whirl3d> Anomie21, there is nothing wrong with your syntax if you have a local version of jquery.tweets.js in the same directory as your html page--but that would be weird. Perhaps you need to check the url to the source js.
[02:27:28] <mindis|work> MrGando from a quick glance i'd guess MAK's reply has the answer
[02:27:37] <SrPx> <div id="mydiv" something="test"></div> how do I get the content of "something" in jquery? like jQuery("#mydiv").something(
[02:27:58] <Whirl3d> squeakytoy, there's nothing that I have used or know of, but that's not saying much. I would probably just use javascript text transforms to handle it, but maybe someone else knows better.
[02:28:02] <Anomie21> Whirl3d: Yep, I do - It's here -- http://cravenpublishing.com/jquery.tweets.0.1.js
[02:28:20] <MrGando> mindis|work: I've tried all the solutions, all of them return nil or something :(, I can't really find the problemâ€¦ I'm willing to upload a zipfile with the 3 files involved â€¦ I'm really puzzled
[02:28:51] <mindis|work> SrPx assuming it's a standard attribute it would be something like $('#mydiv').attr('something')
[02:29:11] <SrPx> mindis|work: can I set non-standard attributes?
[02:29:47] <mindis|work> SrPx i don't think so but you can use the HTML5 data feature accessed through .data()
[02:29:57] <SrPx> hmm
[02:30:06] <SrPx> ill read about this
[02:30:07] <SrPx> thanks
[02:31:20] <Whirl3d> Anomie21, did you put the script in the head of the dom?
[02:32:01] <Whirl3d> SrPx, you can access non-standard attributes using .attr
[02:32:13] <SrPx> ...?
[02:32:44] <Whirl3d> Not sure if it works on all browsers, but I have used $("somediv").attr("hint")   before and hint is non-standard
[02:33:05] <Whirl3d> certainly not best practice, though.
[02:33:13] <Anomie21> Whirl3d: yep
[02:34:09] <Whirl3d> Anomie21, well, ya got me then. I've never used that script before (though it looks mighty simple)...have your tried typing the jsonp url in your browser address bar to see what results you get?
[02:34:37] <mindis|work> i even avoided using the data attributes. i just keep a reference to the object in an array elsewhere bundled with whatever data i want
[02:35:02] <Whirl3d> SrPx, the .data function of jquery works, too, cross-browser
[02:35:53] <SrPx> hmm
[02:36:02] <mindis|work> fucking HTML5. they should get it set in stone already
[02:36:23] <mindis|work> and make it as strict as XHTML strict
[02:36:33] <Whirl3d> SrPx, so you would use $("#mydiv").data("something","test"), for example.
[02:36:50] <SrPx> to set just attribute?
[02:37:07] <SrPx> $("#mydiv").data("something","test") = value
[02:37:16] <mindis|work> it creates an attribute called data-something with the value of test
[02:37:26] <Whirl3d> No, like $("#mydiv").data("somelabel","somevalue);
[02:37:33] <SrPx> wait lol, nevermind
[02:37:37] <SrPx> misread it horribly wrong
[02:37:44] <Whirl3d> then to access it: $("#mydiv").data("somelabel") would give you "somevalue"
[02:38:03] <SrPx> yes, good. thank you
[02:38:06] <mindis|work> but when you use data() you automatically access it with data("something") instead of data("data-something")
[02:53:48] <MrGando> Guys, I'm trying to prepend some html code to a div, https://gist.github.com/3a81889d1c648d9a1258 If I do it like the second way that I mention in this gist, it works, but I don't know why the first way doesn't work. Any idea ?

[03:39:03] <dwt> Hi there, I'm having a hard time parsing xml with namespaced tagnames
[03:39:18] <dwt> basically $(something).find('content:encoded') doesn't work
[03:39:22] <dwt> also with escapes like this:
[03:39:37] <dwt> $(something).find('content\\:encoded')
[03:39:49] <dwt> I've tried
[03:40:02] <dwt> $(something).find([nodeName='content\\:encoded'])
[03:40:03] <dwt> and
[03:40:06] <dwt> $(something).find([nodeName='content:encoded'])
[03:40:09] <dwt> but that also doesn't work
[03:40:21] <dwt> and only found this workaround to seem to work
[03:40:27] <dwt> $(item).children().filter(function(){return this.nodeName === 'content:encoded'})

[03:40:39] <dwt> am I misunderstanding the way sizzle / jquery works?

[04:13:36] <mehrdad_> it is the utmost open source achivement i'm telling u
[04:13:58] <mehrdad_> they have succeeded in making me suffer
[04:13:59] <anticom> what's the equivalent to .find() again, without searching recursivley in child-elements but only in the selected set of elements?
[04:14:52] <Whirl3d> .filter() ?
[04:15:00] <nFFF> Whirl3d, iterate over every <select> if it has a class called 'styled', place a <span> element before it
[04:15:11] <nFFF> with the span contained the selects text
[04:15:15] <anticom> Whirl3d yea, thank you (:
[04:15:38] <Whirl3d> nFFF, you mean the value of the select element?
[04:15:54] <Whirl3d> or the literal text of the select node
[04:16:04] <nFFF> yes literally text on the select node
[04:16:32] <Whirl3d> for like an html demo or something...
[04:16:43] <nFFF> or on the from the first option node
[04:16:48] <nFFF> its to make custom select menus
[04:16:54] <nFFF> i.e. hide the html element
[04:17:01] <nFFF> put a custom designed span eleemnt on top
[04:18:47] <nFFF> Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/Aj7J2/8/
[04:18:57] <nFFF> perhaps this would get the literaly text from the first option
[04:19:15] <nFFF> or it in my mind should, but doesnt :>
[04:24:50] <nFFF> Whirl3d any ideas? :|
[04:29:46] <kuya> hello, ie doesnt like calling .html(some_css) on a <style> element - anyone encountered this and/or know a workaround?

[04:36:31] <n3rddeveloper> $('.select').each(function() { whats wrong with this? - you need the '.' to assign it to the class of 'select'

[04:55:31] <sorcerer86pt> this is for the navigation menu
[04:55:36] <nFFF> for every elemet li that's visible,  you want to take the li and make it into a link?
[04:55:45] <sorcerer86pt> no
[04:55:58] <sorcerer86pt> i want to create an link item
[04:56:31] <sorcerer86pt> with class =boxlnk-ietm and id equal to an id number
[04:56:34] <sorcerer86pt> 0 to count
[04:56:43] <sorcerer86pt> so when the user click it
[04:56:45] <a> hey
[04:56:47] <nFFF> $('li:visible').each() for a start
[04:58:03] <nFFF> sorcerer86pt put some html in there too to show what your doing
[04:58:07] <nFFF> I dont really understand
[04:58:19] <risky_s> hi I am have a simple red square using the html5 svg tag and I am trying to fade out - http://jsfiddle.net/HDrSR/

[05:00:55] <nFFF> is this what your trying to do?
[05:01:19] <sorcerer86pt> for the listitem
[05:01:28] <sorcerer86pt> it's an var that already has the images
[05:02:01] <nFFF> man aint going throught hat code )
[05:02:14] <sorcerer86pt> i understand
[05:02:18] <sorcerer86pt> completly
[05:02:33] <nFFF> no idea what your trying to do, maybe someone else can help
[05:02:52] <nFFF> are you trying to add '<a class="boxpluslnk-item" id="' + ind +'" href="javascript:void(0) " />' this to a list of links already?
[05:03:05] <nFFF> i.e. listitem variablke
[05:03:51] <sorcerer86pt> no
[05:04:12] <sorcerer86pt> create a colection of links from the number of images of the gallery
[05:04:14] <sorcerer86pt> ie
[05:04:20] <sorcerer86pt> the gallery has 5 images
[05:04:26] <sorcerer86pt> then it has 5 links
[05:04:31] <sorcerer86pt> if it has 6
[05:04:36] <sorcerer86pt> then 6 links
[05:04:39] <nFFF> ok
[05:04:55] <sorcerer86pt> then for each link
[05:05:12] <berger_> hi! How do i make this work: content.siblings().fadeOut( function( content ){ content.slideDown(); } );
[05:05:12] <sorcerer86pt> we associate an onclick
[05:05:24] <sorcerer86pt> for the function scroll
[05:05:29] <sorcerer86pt> with the id of the link
[05:05:39] <sorcerer86pt> so it can go to that image
[05:05:42] <sorcerer86pt> in particular
[05:05:54] <nFFF> but your not giving me any idea of code structure
[05:06:01] <nFFF> are the images within the <li> elements?
[05:07:39] <nFFF> $('li:visible').each(fuction(ind) {links += '<a class="boxpluslnk-item" id="' + ind +'" href="javascript:void(0) " />'; }); <----- this will go through each list element and create an increment link based on the index of the element within the list
[05:07:47] <sorcerer86pt> <li><a href="<path to image"><img></a></li>
[05:07:49] <nFFF> isnt this what you want?

[05:22:57] <veg^> hello, is it possible to set async: false for jsonp request
[05:23:44] <veg^> oh i see, nope
[05:24:34] <veg^> is it some solution how to emulate it, or i need to use callback function for every function..
[05:24:45] <seutje> why do u want it async?
[05:25:27] <veg^> i work with database, and i need results will available after each line of code
[05:25:39] <veg^> i mean, insert; find
[05:26:45] <veg^> any hint?
[05:27:29] <seutje> u can store the jqXHR object and check if it's done, if a callback isn't an option for ur use-case
[05:29:05] <thomaschaaf> Hello mr ninja ryanseddon :)
[05:46:26] <shwaiil> Q: I'm wosted to .delegate(), I find myself trying to use .on() that looks easier, but sometimes it's not triggered a lot, for example $('#myId').on('click', function(){ ... }); I wonder why ? Thanks!
[05:47:00] <shwaiil> while in the same context, using .delegate() works fine for sample #myId $('body').delegate('#myId', 'click', function(){ ...})
[05:47:08] <shwaiil> Any tips would be appreciated! Thanks for looking ;)
[05:54:04] <xec> shwaiil: what do you mean by "not triggered a lot"? do you have a live site we can debug? see ?demo
[05:54:05] <bot-t> shwaiil, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[05:57:22] <seutje> odd, my colorbox won't fire any of its events :/
[05:57:47] <z0n3d> ..
[05:57:51] <Eviltwin> shwaiil: .on's syntax is identical to .delegate's except the first and second argument are reversed
[05:57:57] <shwaiil> xec, the event is not triggered. unfortunately when testing for basic stuff works
[05:58:11] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: yeah... I changed a delegate and didnt worked
[05:58:12] <Eviltwin> shwaiil: The way you wrote it there, it works like bind
[05:58:17] <shwaiil> its not the first time :T
[05:58:45] <shwaiil> yeah like $('#myThing').on('click', function(){ . .. });
[05:58:49] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: right ?
[05:58:58] <Eviltwin> shwaiil: Write a .delegate
[05:59:30] <Eviltwin> What do those look like?
[05:59:32] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: if I try basic stuff, for example in jsfiddle i'll work
[05:59:39] <z0n3d> on() replaced delegate i thought
[06:00:05] <Eviltwin> z0n3d: .on superseded .delegate
[06:00:13] <shwaiil> the delegate look like $('element').delegate('.my-el', 'click', function(){ console.log('works fine'); });
[06:00:17] <Eviltwin> But .delegate isn't deprecated or anything like that
[06:00:35] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: people say .on() instead :P
[06:00:49] <Eviltwin> shwaiil: Now I want you to write the exact same thing but change the word "delegate" to "on" and switch '.my-el' and 'click'
[06:00:59] <z0n3d> shwaiil, if it works in jsfiddle... obviously it's something else that's making your code not work
[06:01:15] <Eviltwin> shwaiil: Show me what you end up with when you do that
[06:01:21] <shwaiil> z0n3d: yyeah, sure, nice point. but its strange that when delegate, it works :T
[06:01:51] <xec> -.-
[06:01:52] <z0n3d> oooh
[06:02:14] <z0n3d> shwaiil, latest version of jquery?
[06:02:15] <Eviltwin> shwaiil: I want you to write the exact same delegate you wrote above but change the word "delegate" to "on" and switch '.my-el' and 'click'
[06:05:26] <z0n3d> so does .on work also as .live? $("#elem-thats-not-defined-yet").on("click", function() {...}); will work?
[06:06:02] <Eviltwin> NO
[06:06:59] <seutje> aha, someone was eating my events >:|
[06:07:26] <z0n3d> Eviltwin, "As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers" - so what's the replacement for .live? (for dynamically generated content)
[06:09:15] <Eviltwin> z0n3d: .........
[06:09:17] <Eviltwin> .delegate
[06:10:30] <Eviltwin> Okay, I guess I'm explaining this yet again
[06:10:38] <Eviltwin> I believe that makes the count 15
[06:11:02] <z0n3d> lol :P
[06:11:04] <Eviltwin> So people had been doing things like $("a.external").click(function(){...})
[06:11:21] <Eviltwin> And noticed that as they added new <a class="external">s, they didn't have that click listener
[06:11:42] <Eviltwin> And then there was .live
[06:11:55] <Eviltwin> And all people needed to do was $("a.external").live("click", function(){...})
[06:12:01] <Eviltwin> And lo and behold,
[06:12:26] <Eviltwin> It applied to all <a class="external">s present and future
[06:12:54] <Eviltwin> And if you removed the class, it didn't applied
[06:12:58] <Eviltwin> apply*
[06:13:16] <Eviltwin> But there were lots of oddities
[06:13:23] <Eviltwin> And some events it didn't work for
[06:13:37] <z0n3d> i've read about why .live is bad, if you want to skip that part :P
[06:13:38] <quicksilver> z0n3d: the page which says "As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated" also explains, underneath, how to use 'on' to replace it.
[06:13:49] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[06:13:59] <quicksilver> "...Rewriting the .live() method in terms of its successors is straightforward...."
[06:14:02] <Eviltwin> The problem with $("a.external").live
[06:14:16] <Eviltwin> Is that it selects every <A> with class "external"
[06:14:25] <Eviltwin> And says, fuck that, I'm binding to the document
[06:14:27] <MagePsycho> Hi Guys
[06:14:34] <MagePsycho> can you help me to sort li items
[06:14:35] <MagePsycho> http://jsfiddle.net/UcqjX/118/
[06:14:37] <Eviltwin> And captures all click events
[06:15:10] <Eviltwin> And sees if they match
[06:15:19] <Eviltwin> But makes that wasteful selection
[06:15:24] <Eviltwin> And uses misleading syntax
[06:15:28] <MagePsycho> any idea on: http://jsfiddle.net/UcqjX/118/
[06:15:37] <Eviltwin> .delegate uses better syntax and doesn't have that wasteful selection
[06:15:54] <Eviltwin> And as quicksilver pointed out, how to use .delegate and .on to produce the same outcome, is explained on the .live and .delegate pages
[06:16:10] <Eviltwin> And no, the syntax doesn't look like .live, if it did that would be a retarded backwards step
[06:16:13] <kborchers> MagePsycho: http://jsfiddle.net/UcqjX/119/
[06:16:22] <Eviltwin> The whole point was to not make that wasted selection
[06:16:26] <z0n3d> right
[06:16:47] <anticom> .unload() doesn't prevent the tab from being closed. is there a native jQ option, to do that?
[06:16:57] <MagePsycho> kborchers: thanks a lot man
[06:16:58] <MagePsycho> that works
[06:17:02] <kborchers> np
[06:17:04] <Eviltwin> anticom: You want to force the user to not leave your site
[06:17:16] <Eviltwin> Yeah...I'm sure that's going to be really easy to do
[06:17:17] <anticom> Eviltwin not without confirmation
[06:17:27] <Eviltwin> window.confirm!
[06:17:38] <anticom> i want to open an ui-dialog and when user clicks a certain button i want to close the tab, otherwise it should stay open Eviltwin
[06:17:48] <Eviltwin> Not possible
[06:18:06] <Eviltwin> Because it means you'd need to be able to arbitrarily prevent the user from closing the tab
[06:18:23] <z0n3d> Eviltwin, so, basically, you should use .on, unless you need to specify an event for the future, in which case you .delegate?
[06:18:33] <Eviltwin> z0n3d: ....................
[06:18:55] <Eviltwin> z0n3d: Scroll down to the first code block: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[06:19:12] <Eviltwin> z0n3d: Scroll down to the first code block: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:19:27] <anticom> Eviltwin but i could use confirm return value to open tab, if he clicks no
[06:19:28] <Eviltwin> Both tell you EXACTLY how to do .live or .delegate using .on
[06:19:42] <anticom> kind of a work arround, but if there's no other way i have to deal with that i guess (:
[06:19:48] <t4nkd> Is there a 'tabs' plugin that's like, super lightweight, or is rolling my own jquery ui download going to be the 'best' option for this?
[06:21:55] <anticom> Eviltwin but i still didn't quite get, where to call window.confirm()
[06:22:00] <anticom> in the unload event?
[06:22:21] <lowerkey> Hi, I'm trying to get jquery ui's selectable to work, any help would be appreciated: http://pastebin.com/DXQAkc4p
[06:22:25] <z0n3d> Eviltwin, all i'm asking is that, $(document).on("click", "a.offsite", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); }); will work for all FUTURE <a class=offsite>s?  in the jquery api .delegate and .live both clearly state "now or in the future" .. .on doesn't. which was the whole reason i asked
[06:22:46] <anticom> lowerkey please use http://jsfiddle.net
[06:22:52] <MagePsycho> kborchers: what if i have multiple ul items
[06:22:59] <MagePsycho> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/UcqjX/121/
[06:23:03] <MagePsycho> Thanks in advance
[06:23:18] <Eviltwin> z0n3d: Read the "Direct and delegated events" section
[06:23:33] <anticom> MagePsycho iterate though them using .each()
[06:24:01] <anticom> $("ul").children().each(....)
[06:25:10] <kborchers> MagePsycho: http://jsfiddle.net/UcqjX/121/
[06:26:54] <MagePsycho> kborchers: it's the same as the last one, may be you need to update
[06:27:24] <kborchers> MagePsycho: sorry didn't copy correctly http://jsfiddle.net/UcqjX/122/
[06:27:29] <MagePsycho> kborchers: this is what i want to have: http://jsfiddle.net/UcqjX/123/
[06:28:58] <MrGando> Hey guys, I'm appending a div that displaces another div inside a container, this displacement is not smooth (the 2nd div just "pops in" ) , is there a way I could make this in a smooth fashion?
[06:29:56] <MagePsycho> kborchers: that's what i would like to have
[06:30:13] <t4nkd> make the div you're appending transform it's dimension
[06:30:48] <kborchers> MagePsycho: jsfiddle won't load for me now and i gotta go. others should be able to help you though
[06:31:03] <t4nkd> e.g. add the div at 0x0 and grow it to whatever you want to end up with, or grow a wrapper around that element and fade it in(to push aside the sibling elements)
[06:31:42] <MagePsycho> kborchers: that really help me.. thanks a tons
[06:31:57] <MrGando> t4nkd: I see, thanks
[06:32:12] <fist> hey, i would like to prevent all other scripts (<script>-tags) to be executed.. i added $('script').remove(); into my document.ready function, but the scripts still get executed. any ideas?
[06:32:22] <t4nkd> MrGando: np
[06:32:35] <Eviltwin> fist: These are scripts already in the document?
[06:32:41] <t4nkd> fist: scripts execute before the document is ready?
[06:32:56] <fist> yes in the document
[06:33:05] <fist> so its too late in document.ready?
[06:33:33] <t4nkd> yeah, if the document is ready, scripts are loaded and executed already
[06:33:52] <Eviltwin> Kind of the point
[06:33:52] <lowerkey> http://jsfiddle.net/HfEEY/ ctrl-select doesn't seem to work
[06:34:01] <lowerkey> is there a special option i have to pass to enable it?
[06:34:25] <Eviltwin> What browser / OS?
[06:34:57] <lowerkey> firefox9.0.1/windows7
[06:35:01] <fist> is there a way get my script executed before the other scripts?
[06:35:42] <lowerkey> & chrome/windows7
[06:37:56] <Eviltwin> fist: If it's included first
[06:40:38] <z0n3d> "Eviltwin, so, basically, you should use .on, unless you need to specify an event for the future, in which case you .delegate?" - why did you tell me no?
[06:40:56] <z0n3d> " If new HTML is being injected into the page, select the elements and attach event handlers after the new HTML is placed into the page. Or, use delegated events to attach an event handler, as described next."
[06:40:56] <quicksilver> z0n3d: .on covers all cases.
[06:41:14] <quicksilver> on can do delegation.
[06:41:36] <z0n3d> "Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to .on()"
[06:41:37] <tstauffe> with the jquery template plugin is there anyway to check if something is not set i.e. {{if !foo}} or do I just do an empty statement  with an {{else}}
[06:41:50] <z0n3d> ...
[06:42:05] <z0n3d> am i missing something here
[06:42:08] <Eviltwin> z0n3d: Yes
[06:42:11] <quicksilver> you are, yes
[06:42:13] <Eviltwin> Apparently
[06:42:34] <z0n3d> it specifically says to use .on the element must already exist on the pag
[06:42:38] <Eviltwin> Do you know what $("#foo").on(".bar", "click", myHandler) does?
[06:42:42] <Eviltwin> Err
[06:42:46] <Eviltwin> Do you know what $("#foo").delegate(".bar", "click", myHandler) does?
[06:42:54] <Eviltwin> It calls $("#foo").on("click", ".bar", myHandler);
[06:43:06] <JJMalina> Anyone know how I can assign something to the enter key keydown event?

[06:44:17] <Eviltwin> Right there in the source
[06:44:26] <Eviltwin> If you look at my examples above
[06:44:35] <Eviltwin> What they're trying to make clear is that #foo must exist for this to work
[06:44:40] <Eviltwin> Just like with .delegate
[06:45:19] <TheRedOctober> Hi all.  Is there any movement on a horizontal option for Accordion?
[06:45:20] <Eviltwin> And it will apply for anything inside #foo with class .bar when its clicked
[06:45:37] <Eviltwin> The problem is that saying "current and future" can be very misleading
[06:45:52] <Eviltwin> People thing that somehow it's getting bound to the new elements when they're created
[06:45:56] <Eviltwin> And that is not what's happening
[06:46:00] <Eviltwin> It's using event bubbling
[06:46:08] <z0n3d> Eviltwin, that is definitely how i interpreted it.
[06:46:21] <Eviltwin> How you interpreted what?
[06:46:28] <Eviltwin> The "current and future"?
[06:46:28] <JJMalina> z0n3d right but dont I need some kind of listener for it?
[06:46:34] <z0n3d> JJMalina, http://pastebin.com/pX4BWAYg
[06:47:19] <z0n3d> Eviltwin, yes. i thought it was binding when i created a new element.
[06:47:22] <JJMalina> z0n3d: thanks
[06:47:26] <Eviltwin> It absolutely does not
[06:47:38] <Eviltwin> And that's why .live is particularly misleading
[06:47:48] <Eviltwin> And that's why calling it "current and future" is misleading
[06:48:03] <Eviltwin> It EFFECTIVELY binds to all "current and future" elements
[06:48:13] <Eviltwin> But does so by binding to some parent element
[06:48:21] <Eviltwin> And catching all the events that bubble up
[06:48:31] <Eviltwin> And checking if they match
[06:48:34] <Eviltwin> The selector
[06:49:18] <Eviltwin> If I had to compare explaining this to someone
[06:49:28] <Eviltwin> It's like showing them the simple deception of a magic trick
[06:49:42] <Eviltwin> After they see how it works, they realize there wasn't anything magical going on at all
[06:49:50] <Eviltwin> And just feel deceived
[06:49:54] <z0n3d> Eviltwin, so $(document).on("click", "a.offsite", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); }); will work for all (incl FUTURE) <a class=offsite>s?  - since the parent is document it's probably the most inefficient way, but it would work, right?
[06:50:38] <jacky123> who is a jqueryui expert here, resizable is givin me a pain :(
[06:50:38] <Eviltwin> It will work for any element such that when clicked, it is an <A> tag with class "offsite"
[06:50:54] <Eviltwin> But what's going to happen to make that possible
[06:51:05] <Eviltwin> Is that with every click event, jQuery's going to check the event.target
[06:51:14] <Eviltwin> And see if it matches that "a.offsite" selector
[06:51:22] <Eviltwin> (And any others of these you've done)
[06:51:43] <Eviltwin> (Any of the other delegate- or live-style event listeners)
[06:52:06] <Eviltwin> Not so bad most times
[06:52:12] <Eviltwin> But say you were delegating mousemove or something
[06:52:26] <Eviltwin> Suddenly every mousemove anywhere on the page needs extra processing
[06:52:37] <Eviltwin> Instead of just the ones over the elements you selected
[06:52:44] <z0n3d> so the parent selector should be as specific as possible
[06:52:48] <Eviltwin> Yes
[06:52:52] <Eviltwin> Without breaking your functionality
[06:53:04] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[06:53:09] <z0n3d> i do feel deceived :P
[06:53:13] <Eviltwin> Yup
[06:53:20] <z0n3d> thanks
[06:53:24] <Eviltwin> NP
[06:53:34] <Eviltwin> I'm quite practiced at this explanation
[06:53:41] <z0n3d> i see that, lol
[06:59:07] <LordThumper> jsfiddle lagging for anyone?
[06:59:47] <JJMalina> z0n3d: I don't really get how this works, how can you bind a keypress to an element like a button for example
[07:00:10] <jacky123> who is a jqueryui expert here, resizable is givin me a pain :(
[07:00:17] <RLa> JJMalina, won't elements with focus receive key events?
[07:00:36] <z0n3d> JJMalina, how can you bind a keypress to a button.. you can't type inside a button
[07:00:48] <jacky123> let me know if someone can help with resizable problem here, http://css-creations.com/t
[07:00:52] <JJMalina> I'm trying to bind the enter key to the window
[07:00:55] <JJMalina> so
[07:00:55] <z0n3d> you can bind the keypress to the document, and call .click on the button?
[07:01:09] <JJMalina> ok ill try that
[07:01:42] <z0n3d> JJMalina, $(document.keypress(function(e) { var key = e.which ? e.which : e.keyCode; if (key === 13) { // enter was pressed } });
[07:01:59] <z0n3d> $(document).keypress*
[07:02:06] <JJMalina> yeah
[07:14:05] <adfasdfj> Is there an easy way to delay something from happening?
[07:14:09] <adfasdfj> I know .delay()
[07:14:13] <adfasdfj> But it doesn't seem to be working
[07:14:19] <Eviltwin> On the delay page, they point you to setTimeout
[07:14:24] <adfasdfj> Basically trying to hide a page, wait a few secs, show the page
[07:14:32] <adfasdfj> I figured that was the answer
[07:14:44] <adfasdfj> But don't you have to wrap your stuff in a function if you use setTimeout?
[07:15:10] <RLa> yes, you have to
[07:15:12] <fris> .hide() then settimeout
[07:15:18] <whoever_> trying to get an event to fire from a mobile device and .bind("vclick", event will not work), and have jqtouch installed ,any ideas
[07:15:37] <RLa> it's asynchronous, not sleeping and blocking
[07:16:06] <Eviltwin> RLa: ...
[07:16:10] <Eviltwin> Nor is .delay
[07:16:31] <Eviltwin> Take a wild guess at how .delay works
[07:17:34] <adfasdfj> Ok, thanks for your help
[07:17:59] <Eviltwin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/queue.js#L132-142
[07:18:01] <Eviltwin> BOOM! setTimeout
[07:19:56] <ASUChander> How do I convert a javascript object to json in jquery (for example, to include as a single value for a GET parameter)
[07:20:06] <Eviltwin> JSON.stringify
[07:20:10] <ASUChander> thanks!
[07:20:38] <RLa> won't you also need url encoding on top of that
[07:27:04] <Amanda19> i think i have a problem with jquery
[07:27:08] <killscreen> hi guys. Is there a way to select an ancestor using only selectors? IE not .closest().
[07:27:15] <whoever_> trying to get an event to fire from a mobile device and .bind("click", event ) doesn't seem to work and it should , and have jqtouch installed ,any ideas
[07:27:15] <Amanda19> i tried to install pop up script from this page
[07:27:30] <Amanda19> http://www.bloggermint.com/2011/06/how-to-create-modal-subscribe-box-using-jquery/
[07:27:35] <Amanda19> but it does not work
[07:28:21] <Eviltwin> killscreen: Explain further
[07:28:38] <jacky123> guiess no one
[07:28:50] <Amanda19> http://www.numerologija.org/ here the popup should appear
[07:28:55] <Amanda19> but it does not
[07:28:58] <Amanda19> can you check it out guys
[07:29:13] <killscreen> Eviltwin: thing is, im building the site with drupal wich has a  nice jquery based abstraction layer for ajax.
[07:29:39] <killscreen> The downside is i cant really use functions to navigate the dom tree, im bound to just plain selectors.
[07:30:16] <Amanda19> can somsbedy help*
[07:30:25] <Eviltwin> So you want to do something like select the parent of #foo?
[07:30:28] <Amanda19> the query is messed up i think
[07:30:32] <Eviltwin> The parent of a selector
[07:30:32] <killscreen> So id like to remove the parent <tr> from where my form is located, but I have to navigate from the form element itself.
[07:30:49] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ Amanda19
[07:30:49] <bot-t> Amanda19, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[07:31:27] <Eviltwin> killscreen: Hmm... so it's like {{reference to my form element}}.find("...")
[07:31:45] <killscreen> yes, except i cant use funtions. just plain old selectors.
[07:31:58] <Eviltwin> I'm not understanding why and what scope the selectors are in
[07:32:02] <killscreen> and it seems there are ways to navigate down the tree, but not up.
[07:32:16] <Eviltwin> Give me an example of navigating down
[07:32:29] <killscreen> http://api.jquery.com/descendant-selector/
[07:32:51] <killscreen> what i want is ancestor selector
[07:33:14] <Eviltwin> The thing is there isn't one, it doesn't make sense for ther eto be one
[07:33:26] <Eviltwin> So that's why I'm trying to figure out the specifics
[07:33:31] <Eviltwin> To see how you might be able to work around it
[07:33:59] <killscreen> Oh, ok.
[07:34:06] <Eviltwin> If it's not scoped too tight, you might be able to use this: http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[07:34:14] <Eviltwin> tr:has(#myform) for example
[07:34:32] <Eviltwin> Will select the tr that contains the element with ID "myform"
[07:35:09] <killscreen> Yeah, that could work, as long as it traverses all the way down, and not just to immediate children.
[07:35:23] <killscreen> because there are som tds and divs in there.
[07:35:38] <Eviltwin> I think to be immediate children, it needs to be tr:has(>#myform)
[07:35:41] <Eviltwin> But I could be wrong about that
[07:35:46] <Amanda19> killscreen can you try if it works?
[07:35:56] <Amanda19> http://www.numerologija.org
[07:36:02] <killscreen> "The expression $('div:has(p)') matches a <div> if a <p> exists anywhere among its descendants, not just as a direct child."
[07:36:06] <killscreen> :)
[07:36:33] <Eviltwin> Yup
[07:37:30] <killscreen> Thanks for the help.
[07:37:37] <killscreen> that worked great.
[07:38:56] <engaged> I have some divs like <div class="box" num="0">text</div>  <div class="box" num="1">text2</div> and on the click of text i want to pop an infowindow on google maps google.maps.event.addListener($('[num="0"]'), 'click', function() { //some stuff });  where 0 corresponds to the num="" in the div and I have a listener for each number - but that doesn't work.... and I can't do getElementById instead of the jquery b/c i don't have seperate id's due to css...
[07:41:34] <Amanda19> does it work or not?   http://www.numerologija.org
[07:41:39] <Amanda19> popup?
[07:44:26] <Eviltwin> engaged: Couple of things
[07:44:36] <Eviltwin> 1) Never do just [attr=val] as a selector
[07:44:43] <Eviltwin> It's equivalent to *[attr=val]
[07:44:54] <Eviltwin> Which means it selects all elements and then checks the attr of each
[07:45:04] <Eviltwin> Use an element type or class or something to filter it first
[07:45:11] <Eviltwin> As those are significantly faster
[07:45:28] <Eviltwin> Second $(...) produces a jQuery collection
[07:45:53] <Eviltwin> jQuery collections aren't elements
[07:46:41] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. Could someone explain what this means in the plugin documentation: Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 ) ---from http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[07:47:02] <engaged> how can ig et the elemtn then if all i know is the num=""?
[07:47:23] <Eviltwin> Unless the Google library is designed to work with jQuery collections, it wouldn't work
[07:47:32] <Eviltwin> But you can get elements from the collection by doing things like [0]
[07:48:08] <Amanda19> can somebody help me, or you will ignore me? please

[07:48:50] <Eviltwin> Read through those slides
[07:48:52] <Eviltwin> Learn to debug
[07:48:53] <engaged> eviltwin i got it another way with jquery and opening the map from an array of infowindows and using $(this).attr("num") as the key
[07:48:55] <Amanda19> in ie the designed collapsed, i dont know why, i validated html and css but still it colapses to the left
[07:49:06] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Do you know what "arguments" is?
[07:49:32] <Whirl3d> sure. I just don't understand why use array.prototype.slice   rather than arguments[1] or something
[07:49:44] <Whirl3d> and thanks for the response, Eviltwin
[07:50:04] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Let's say you have a function foo(myarg) { ... }
[07:50:15] <Eviltwin> And someone calls it via foo(3, 6, 9, 12);
[07:50:20] <Eviltwin> myarg will be 3
[07:50:31] <Eviltwin> arguments will be an array-ish thing like [3, 6, 9, 12]
[07:50:34] <kaolti> Hi guys
[07:50:40] <Whirl3d> I'm with ya.
[07:50:41] <Eviltwin> And Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1) will be an array [6, 9, 12
[07:50:42] <Eviltwin> ]
[07:50:56] <Whirl3d> why not arguments.slice()
[07:51:03] <Eviltwin> Because it's not actually an array
[07:51:09] <Eviltwin> And doesn't have a slice method
[07:51:23] <Whirl3d> Ah. I see. I thought it did have the slice method though it was only like an array.
[07:51:25] <Eviltwin> By applying Array's slice, you can cheat and pretend like it had one
[07:51:36] <Whirl3d> That makes a lot more sense now. Thanks a ton
[07:51:41] <kaolti> Have a question, if I bind a click to an element on the page which is removed and then readded to the page will my click still work?
[07:51:41] <Eviltwin> NP
[07:51:52] <bc29332> I don't know what I am doing with jquery, but I believe what I'm trying to accomplish would be easy.  I found a small snippet that uses the .load function to make a timed refresh of a single div in the page.  It works great, however it is a google map that is updated and it's flickering every 5 seconds or whatever the interval is set to.   Is there the ability to check the data that is currently loaded and only refresh if it changes
[07:51:52] <bc29332> , a timer is still fine to check for the update.
[07:52:04] <Eviltwin> kaolti: If the element is .remove()'d, no. If it is .detach()'d, yes
[07:52:56] <Eviltwin> bc29332: If you have (or can write) code that will determine that there's not been change, then it shouldn't be too hard
[07:53:01] <kaolti> Eviltwin: thanks for answering. The element is inside a div which is reloaded with ajax
[07:53:08] <Eviltwin> A combination of a timer and $.get and $(...).html
[07:53:14] <craigwhite> sorry for noob question but I have a number of dynamically build 'id' objects which I am posting using $(this).attr("id") and the post works but when I return the data, I need to identify which 'id' is updated with the results - so I am trying to assign it as   var mydata = $(this).attr("id") but I can't figure out how to use this selector now...  $(mydata).empty().append(html.closest(mydata).children());   doesn't work

[07:53:38] <sorcerer86pt_> anyone knows an way of selecting an element of an class x with id y
[07:53:51] <sorcerer86pt_> i have an array of links of the same class
[07:53:52] <bc29332> Eviltwin, so the .load that i'm using now is replaced with .get?
[07:53:59] <Eviltwin> sorcerer86pt_: $("#y.x")
[07:54:00] <sorcerer86pt_> and with different ids
[07:54:04] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, I have been in this channel for months now and I have learned more from you than any book I could read or class that I could take. You really are generous with your knowledge, and I really appreciate it.
[07:54:37] <nFFF> whats the jquery function to find the previous <span element and add some text to it element
[07:54:43] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: I try to be and most people don't express their appreciation so thanks
[07:55:06] <kaolti> agreed, big ups to Eviltwin
[07:55:27] <Eviltwin> bc29332: .get, then check if it changed, use .html to replace the appropriate section
[07:55:50] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: we try not to clog the chat further but I'm pretty sure many people appreciate your help in this channel
[07:55:58] <xckpd7> including me
[07:56:03] <Eviltwin> It's going to be a little more involved than just .load
[07:57:07] <Eviltwin> nFFF: Hmm? Pretty sure there's no function that simulataneously finds some element and sets its text
[07:57:24] <bc29332> Yeah, I don't know if I have enough of a base layer to dive in.  I might have to flip a few chapters back and start from page 1.  Just like most things, I am trying to rush it through and just accomplish this single task.

[07:58:05] <lechi> hello
[07:58:13] <Eviltwin> I highly suggest that people gain an advanced (or at least intermediate) knowledge of JavaScript before diving into jQuery
[07:58:29] <Eviltwin> Right away jQuery starts doing somewhat advanced JavaScript things
[07:58:53] <logicrises> could anybody recommend a jquery plugin that interfaces with google.
[07:59:03] <logicrises> *a language translator
[07:59:11] <lechi> i have maybe a stupid question but this drives me out of my mind. When in chrome i get to this on an uploadify event var data = $.parseJSON(response) it gets out from the event and nothing is done even if the response is OK and it works on firefox and IE
[07:59:54] <Amanda19> how to debug IE for layout
[07:59:58] <lechi> if i am not parsting the reponse but from string var data = $.parseJSON('{"status":"OK","poza":"34803468508ahills.jpg","message":"Poza a fost trimisa cu succes. "}'); like this it works
[07:59:59] <Amanda19> i cleaned html and css
[08:00:09] <Amanda19> and the design is still messed up in IE
[08:00:16] <Amanda19> in firefox it is ok and chrome
[08:00:23] <NoiseEee> Amanda19: #css
[08:00:26] <lechi> event if that is the json response that the server is sent but i am putting it manually in the code
[08:00:33] <Amanda19> i cant go there
[08:00:46] <veg^> why i don't got a error callback using ajax when server returns NetworkError: 502 Bad Gateway
[08:00:47] <Amanda19> i cant join that channel
[08:00:51] <bc29332> I can see that, as most languages I can stumble through and and write working code, although not pretty, or effecient, it works.   The past 2 hours of Jquery has been completly confusing to me, so I must be missing a lot.
[08:01:08] <NoiseEee> Amanda19: not sure why you can't go there, but your questions are irrelevant here
[08:01:11] <Eviltwin> veg^: error should trigger
[08:01:11] <lechi> anyone can help me ?
[08:01:19] <Eviltwin> veg^: Unless you were using JSONP or something perhaps
[08:01:28] <Eviltwin> bc29332: http://jsfiddle.net/w557N/
[08:01:30] <veg^> i use jsonp
[08:01:35] <AdvoWork> I'm adding data to a datatables table, which is adding correctly. Its dynamically creating a link. Which when i click should *do something - in this case call testme();* it fails in the datatables, but if i inspect the element, and copy the exact code, put it in my html and test, it works. Any suggestions please, no errors shown.
[08:01:38] <Eviltwin> IIRC .load works something like that
[08:01:46] <Eviltwin> veg^: Do you know how JSONP works?

[08:02:19] <xckpd7> Amanda19: unless you were banned, make sure your have authenticated with NickServ?
[08:02:29] <veg^> can i catch it?
[08:02:35] <nVee> Hey guys, I want to write a basic paging script using jquery. What do you consider be best, to using json and return all rows which may be requested, insert it into a table and have jquery break it down into "chunks" for easy paging, or is it best to make seperate $.post() calls getting only the values from the database?
[08:02:44] <nVee> which is required
[08:02:56] <Eviltwin> craigwhite: The selector needs to be "#" + mydata
[08:02:57] <nVee> i'm just looking for best practise with paging and jquery
[08:02:57] <nVee> :)
[08:03:05] <JAAulde> which bot is in use here in #jquery
[08:03:25] <Amanda19> i guess somebody banned this ip
[08:03:30] <Amanda19> my hotel
[08:03:33] <Eviltwin> nVee: Depends on how much data you're workign with
[08:03:45] <Mkop> is api.jquery.com down or something?
[08:03:51] <Eviltwin> I believe so
[08:03:53] <Eviltwin> It's not working for me
[08:04:08] <Mkop> yep. http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/api.jquery.com
[08:04:19] <nVee> hey Eviltwin, which would be the best irrespective of the data amount?
[08:04:40] <nVee> i would prefferably want to write the script and use it on resultsets irrespective of the amount of data it returns
[08:04:47] <sorcerer86pt_> anyone can tell me why this script says
[08:04:49] <bc29332> Eviltwin, thanks for that.  I'll start with that and the links you provided.
[08:05:00] <sorcerer86pt_> that an element has no toggleClass function
[08:05:01] <sorcerer86pt_> http://jsfiddle.net/ScTQP/1/
[08:05:01] <Eviltwin> veg^: "Note: [The error] handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests."
[08:05:07] <veg^> y i see
[08:05:07] <craigwhite> $("#" + mydata).empty().append(html.closest)("#" + mydata).children()); ?
[08:05:10] <veg^> so no way
[08:05:18] <nVee> a guy at the office believes you should return all rows using php, and then have jquery itterate through that say table and build paging through that
[08:05:18] <sorcerer86pt_> the items are in form a#<idx>.boxpluslnk
[08:05:37] <veg^> that means entire script stops when error
[08:05:48] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, was the load thing for me?
[08:05:52] <Eviltwin> nVee: If there's a lot of data, it will take a long time to load all of them
[08:05:55] <nVee> where iv'e seen an approach where you return the first say 10 rows, then send a request to ajax call to retrieve more rows
[08:06:05] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: No, I missed your issue
[08:06:10] <kaolti> Eviltwin: is there anything similar to live() which will keep the binded events after an element is removed
[08:06:14] <nVee> hmmm
[08:06:17] <nVee> that makes sense :)
[08:06:37] <Eviltwin> kaolti: Depends on what you're doing. You shouldn't ever use .live though, use the slightly-different .delegate syntax
[08:06:44] <lechi> i have maybe a stupid question but this drives me out of my mind. When in chrome i get to this on an uploadify event var data = $.parseJSON(response) it gets out from the event and nothing is done even if the response is OK and it works on firefox and IE
[08:06:49] <lechi> if i am not parsting the reponse but from string var data = $.parseJSON('{"status":"OK","poza":"34803468508ahills.jpg","message":"Poza a fost trimisa cu succes. "}'); like this it works
[08:06:53] <lechi> event if that is the json response that the server is sent but i am putting it manually in the code
[08:06:56] <lechi> anyone can help me ?
[08:07:20] <Eviltwin> nVee: What I would do is have the server do some paging
[08:07:25] <Eviltwin> Configurable
[08:07:38] <Eviltwin> ?pagesize=100&pagenum=3 or something like that
[08:07:39] <nVee> hey guys, is there documentation available (simple documentation ;)) for writing your own jquery plugins, do you have a link perhaps?
[08:07:39] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Couldn't find "pagesize=100&pagenum=3 or something like that" in jQuery Docs.
[08:08:00] <Eviltwin> And you don't necessarily have to show all 100 at once (client-side paging)
[08:08:02] <Mkop> wow, this thing is outdated.....
[08:08:08] <Mkop> http://docs.jquery.com/Alternative_Resources
[08:08:10] <Eviltwin> But it means you're restricting the amount of data coming down at once
[08:08:24] <Mkop> (stupid xchat clears my clipboard whenever I click in the chat window, so infuriating...)
[08:08:57] <sorcerer86pt_> anyone can see why the script returns that the $selec element has no toggleClass function
[08:09:00] <kaolti> Eviltwin: I can't find anything in the jquery documentation about delegate, I guess it's been removed like live()? Anyway I have a click binded to an element which is removed and readded with load(). so the click event is lost
[08:09:09] <sorcerer86pt_> http://jsfiddle.net/ScTQP/1/
[08:09:31] <Eviltwin> kaolti: What?
[08:09:37] <Eviltwin> .live hasn't been removed and neither has .delegate
[08:09:47] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[08:09:48] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:10:09] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ sorcerer86pt_
[08:10:10] <bot-t> sorcerer86pt_, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[08:10:33] <kaolti> Eviltwin: sorry these pages were giving me 404, weird. thanks!
[08:11:20] <Eviltwin> kaolti: I think the API site was down for a little bit
[08:12:15] <sorcerer86pt_> http://jsfiddle.net/ScTQP/2/
[08:12:26] <sorcerer86pt_> the part that causes the error is there
[08:12:42] <Eviltwin> sliderIndexPosition isn't defined there
[08:13:07] <sorcerer86pt_> simply in chrome it say's that a#<idx>.<classname> doesn't have the toggleClass function
[08:13:15] <nFFF> If anyone needs a custom select in jQuery Ive jsut made a working one
[08:13:34] <Eviltwin> Strings don't have the function toggleClass
[08:13:48] <Eviltwin> You're missing $()'s somewhere
[08:13:50] <sorcerer86pt_> in the rest of the code
[08:13:51] <sorcerer86pt_> is
[08:13:59] <sorcerer86pt_> sliderIndexPosition starts as 0
[08:14:02] <sorcerer86pt_> and goes one
[08:14:14] <sorcerer86pt_> until the end of the array size
[08:14:21] <sorcerer86pt_> it's for an image gallery
[08:14:31] <sorcerer86pt_> lastSliderIndexSize
[08:14:42] <sorcerer86pt_> starts at arraySize-1
[08:15:29] <sorcerer86pt_> if i remove the code on jsfiddle
[08:15:31] <sorcerer86pt_> all works
[08:15:33] <Eviltwin> Let me put it this way
[08:15:42] <sorcerer86pt_> but then i cannot update the class of items
[08:16:01] <sorcerer86pt_> to show the user wich image is showing
[08:16:02] <Eviltwin> "a#0.boxpluslnk-current".toggleClass("boxpluslnk-item boxpluslnk-current") doesn't work
[08:16:13] <tom[]> hi! in the past i have used soundmanager2. is there a better option now?
[08:16:29] <Guddu> Hi All....Could someone please help me in understanding the pieces of code in http://pastebin.com/h7cyZTJZ
[08:16:32] <LordThumper> For some reason after Sortable has finished, the <li> is getting styles applied from the its class directly to the element.style. Any ideas?
[08:16:51] <Mkop> tom[]: in the present I use SM2 and it is great. best option I found in my research
[08:16:55] <sorcerer86pt_> i saw that on the jquery page on .toggleClass
[08:17:00] <sorcerer86pt_> on the comentaries
[08:17:31] <sorcerer86pt_> see MetalPenguen comment
[08:17:38] <tom[]> Mkop: tnx. is there a jq plugin to wrap it?
[08:18:00] <lechi> so no help for me ? no idea???
[08:18:06] <Mkop> I am using it without a query plugin wrapper. don't really see a need for a wrapper, but I am doing really simple stuff with it.
[08:18:17] <AdvoWork> I'm adding data to a datatables table, which is adding correctly. Its dynamically creating a link. Which when i click should *do something - in this case call testme();* it fails in the datatables, but if i inspect the element, and copy the exact code, put it in my html and test, it works. Any suggestions please, no errors shown.
[08:19:58] <tom[]> Mkop: i also used it without jq. i might take a look at https://github.com/adriengibrat/jQuery-SoundManager
[08:21:21] <Mkop> what's the motivation for the wrapper? good APIs don't need wrappers, and what SM2 does is different enough from what jq does that there I don't foresee compatibility issues
[08:21:38] <Guddu> In $(selector).load(url,data,callback) what is URL? Does it has to be a .html or a .php file? Or could it be a web page link also? such as www.google.com
[08:22:20] <Mkop> oh, I see what he's doing there. ok, I see.....
[08:22:54] <Mkop> Guddu: it can be any kind of URL, but if you use a domain other than the one your page is on you will run into security issues
[08:22:58] <Eviltwin> Guddu: It can't violate the SOP
[08:23:00] <Eviltwin> ?sop @ Guddu
[08:23:01] <bot-t> Guddu, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[08:24:08] <Guddu> Thanks Mkop Eviltwin  bot-t ...All this while i was trying to load something cross domain :( I will set it right now.
[08:24:12] <FotoXe33> bonjour à tous
[08:24:22] <phidah> I created this jquery plugin based on a boilerplate that I found - http://paste.viaweb.biz/p/489 - If I call the plugin twice on two different elements, the options are the same. Can you recommend a boilerplate that avoids that?
[08:25:33] <FotoXe33> i've got a script wich crash firefox :/
[08:25:50] <Guddu> Thanks Mkop Eviltwin  bot-t ...One more question...Just to confirm....The url could be a html resource with <html> <body> tags or even soemthing with just <a><div> etc?
[08:26:37] <Mkop> does not need to be a full HTML page. does not even need to be HTML - could be JSON, XML, or whatever else you dream of
[08:26:47] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[08:26:52] <Eviltwin> He's using .load, isn't he?
[08:26:54] <Mkop> all depends on what you do with it once it comes in
[08:26:59] <Eviltwin> It needs to be HTML-ish
[08:27:01] <Mkop> oh
[08:27:26] <Mkop> yeah, with .load it should be HTML, but doesn't need to be a full page. can just be an HTML fragment
[08:27:38] <Eviltwin> .loda also has the ability to only grab a particular ID out of the HTML
[08:27:40] <Guddu> Thanks All :-)
[08:27:42] <Eviltwin> see ?.load
[08:27:42] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[08:27:46] <Eviltwin> Damn

[08:29:43] <webPragmatist> serious question.. should i use http://flowplayer.org/tools/tabs/index.html
[08:29:46] <webPragmatist> or tab ui
[08:29:55] <Doggie52> I am looking to find the CSS style that applies to Suckerfish: when hovering over an entry and a dropdown appears, I want the entry to keep its text color
[08:29:57] <Eviltwin> Entirely up to you
[08:30:03] <AdvoWork> Can anyone explain this please? i put a a href in my code, to call a function in $(document).ready(function() { } it works fine. I do this on the fly, and try and call the same, it fails as it doesnt exist. yet if i move my function outside of $(document).ready(function() {} it works?
[08:30:04] <Eviltwin> I'm sure they have different strengths and weaknesses
[08:30:16] <Eviltwin> I consider the UI tabs to be lighter although they require the weight of jQuery UI
[08:30:50] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: Don't use the on{event} or href attributes to do JavaScript
[08:30:56] <Eviltwin> This is considered a bad practice
[08:31:04] <logicrises> does google translate even work, all the examples I have seen are broken.
[08:31:09] <Eviltwin> Keep a separation between your presentation and your logic
[08:31:32] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: i always dislike how jquery ui puts  so many classes
[08:31:35] <Patabugen> Hey All, in looking for one solutions I've found another problem. Does anyone know why I get problems if I have a string containing <script></script>? Such as here: http://jsfiddle.net/zHJta/1/
[08:31:47] <Patabugen> (and if anyone knows the answer to the other problem I'd be a very happy bunny!)
[08:31:53] <sorcerer86pt_> anyone noticed the jquery site is very slow
[08:31:55] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: If you don't like it, use the other one
[08:31:58] <Doggie52> I meant superfish, not suckerfish
[08:32:20] <Eviltwin> Patabugen: http://jsfiddle.net/zHJta/3/
[08:32:58] <Eviltwin> The way the parsing works
[08:33:03] <Eviltwin> Is the HTML is parsed first
[08:33:04] <kenthree> Patabugen: </script> gets parsed as html
[08:33:25] <Eviltwin> Yes
[08:33:31] <Patabugen> Ah, thank's Evil!
[08:33:39] <Eviltwin> So it thinks the first </script> it sees is the end of the <script>
[08:33:50] <Patabugen> yeah, it makes sense now
[08:34:08] <Eviltwin> Using the //<!-- and //-->, the HTML parser thinks that's all a comment so it ignores that </script>
[08:34:11] <Patabugen> Any idea how to solve the other problem? I'm making fake dialog boxes (I'm replacing real popup windows with frames)
[08:34:22] <Eviltwin> And when JavaScript parses, those looks like single-line JavaScript comments
[08:35:17] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, it was a test, im trying to do: $("#change_date_expected").click(function(event){ }  if i manually put a link with the id of that, it works, if i dynamically do, it doesnt, but its 100% the same link. Any ideas?
[08:35:22] <Mkop> I am so meta, I comment out my comments....
[08:35:36] <Doggie52> rephrase: Does anyone feel comfortable with Superfish? When hovering over a top entry, spawning a dropdown and then moving the mouse over the dropdown, what CSS style applies to the original top entry? I want it to keep the style it had when it was hovered on.
[08:36:00] <logicrises> Patabugen, I would recommend colorbox
[08:36:13] <Eviltwin> What?
[08:36:17] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: What?
[08:36:27] <Patabugen> Why, logicrises?
[08:36:33] <craigwhite> Got it EvilTwin (took me a while) - my problem was the value, not the selector - thanks - you are the best
[08:37:55] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, dynamically im creating a link in, and inserting it into a table. I inspect and copy the element, it looks like: <a href="#" id="change_date_expected" vendor_item_id="74" date_picker_id="date_expected_picker_74">16-01-2012 <img src="calendar.gif"></a>  dynamically, i press that, nothing happens. If i copy that link into my code manually, it works.. any reason why that would be?
[08:38:12] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: Make a jsFiddle example of one of these insertions
[08:38:32] <AdvoWork> even if i get my data from a .php file?
[08:39:24] <Patabugen> logicrises: with Colorbox can I set the HTML including a head script?
[08:39:29] <Eviltwin> Make a static example of how you're inserting the new link and adding the listener
[08:39:30] <versatiletech> ? on @ AdvoWork
[08:39:31] <bot-t> AdvoWork, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:39:33] <AdvoWork> as i get data from php, to list all products, from there i add a product to my cart type table, from there im trying to click on said link, so will i be able to do that with jsfiddle?
[08:40:40] <sorcerer86pt_> if i have an var that holds the id of an item
[08:40:44] <sorcerer86pt_> for example
[08:41:01] <Induane> I've a form which I'm styling with jquery-ui.  It includes some buttons and some links which thanks to the ui, display as buttons which is convenient.  The html is a template used across about 40 forms.  There are a few cases where there is a link in the form which should just be text.  The .uibutton class obviously automatically styles the element as a button.  Is there a way to remove styles on a single element via inline css somehow?
[08:41:07] <versatiletech> or if you're using an older version see ? delegate
[08:41:07] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:41:08] <sorcerer86pt_> var idx='a#'+parseInt(idx,10);
[08:41:38] <Eviltwin> Make a static example of how you're inserting the new link and adding the listener
[08:41:41] <sorcerer86pt_> var idxtxt='a#'+parseInt(idx,10);
[08:41:50] <sorcerer86pt_> how i use idx as an html selector
[08:41:53] <Eviltwin> You can use the /echo/html request mockign if needed
[08:41:58] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, this is the basic example that works for me http://jsfiddle.net/4VvMv/  just trying to get the one that doesnt
[08:42:11] <AdvoWork> the click function is already in place, its only the link i generate
[08:42:46] <versatiletech> sorcerer86pt_: is idx null when you re-assign idx?
[08:43:09] <sorcerer86pt_> i want an new idx
[08:43:22] <sorcerer86pt_> it's for selecting an <a > tag by id
[08:43:36] <sorcerer86pt_> each tag has an id that is an number
[08:43:39] <sorcerer86pt_> and an class
[08:43:59] <sorcerer86pt_> i want to use the selector to toogle the class of the <a > tag by it's id
[08:45:01] <sorcerer86pt_> the line is
[08:45:01] <AdvoWork> Im trying $("#change_date_expected").on("click", function(event){	alert("here");}); and its giving: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on'  any suggestions?
[08:45:02] <sorcerer86pt_> var $selec = 'a#' + parseInt(sliderIndexPosition, 10);
[08:45:11] <versatiletech> sorcerer86pt_: for starters, if you're using an HTML4 doctype you'll need to start the id with a letter instead of a number
[08:45:42] <sorcerer86pt_> it's xhtml
[08:45:51] <sorcerer86pt_> but i will change it
[08:46:24] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: Is your jQuery <1.7?
[08:46:51] <sorcerer86pt_> the problem is that i use the index as an array index
[08:47:05] <sorcerer86pt_> it's for changing the image of an gallery
[08:47:21] <whoever_> i am tring to bind to to click event, can someone assist $("#HelpBtn").bind("click",$(this).click()); for a mobile device and it is not working
[08:47:47] <sorcerer86pt_> var btnItem = $('.boxpluslnk-item', gallery).click(function() {var idx = parseInt($(this).attr("id"));scroll(idx); });
[08:47:52] <xec> whoever_: wth are you trying to do
[08:48:21] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, im currently using jquery-1.5.1.min.js
[08:48:25] <xec> whoever_: .bind() takes a function as second parameter
[08:48:38] <Patabugen> Ah solved! In case anyone else needs this in future: http://jsfiddle.net/zHJta/4/ (creating an iframe with the entire <html> set)
[08:48:47] <versatiletech> you can use data() for each element, if you were using HTML5 you could add a custom HTML data-* attribute to each element
[08:48:51] <danzik171> AdvoWork: use delegate in 1.5.x
[08:48:52] <xec> whoever_: and, you're trying to trigger the same click event that is triggered??
[08:49:13] <versatiletech> $(this).data('picture-index')
[08:49:20] <whoever_> xec: correct i am tring to bind to trigger a click event
[08:49:26] <versatiletech> you'd have to assign that somewhere though
[08:49:54] <xec> whoever_: what does that mean
[08:50:10] <whoever_> xec: the function already exists HelpBtn.click(function) and i am tring to get it to work on mobile
[08:50:12] <logicrises> ive been on this google translator longer than I thought. http://jsfiddle.net/rees/bmkVB/ could anybody point me in the right direction?
[08:50:24] <versatiletech> sorcerer86pt_: $('.selector-to-a-tag').data('picture-index', myPictureIndex)
[08:50:43] <xec> whoever_: what mobile is this?
[08:50:54] <sorcerer86pt_> ah
[08:51:03] <sorcerer86pt_> didn't know that we can do this
[08:51:12] <versatiletech> yep
[08:51:47] <Mkop> I am getting a FOUC with my dialogs. should I just display:none; them in CSS?
[08:52:12] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, danzik171 using the delegate fixed it. why would that be though?
[08:52:32] <danzik171> AdvoWork: because .on doesn't exist in 1.5 .  it's new to 1.7.
[08:52:33] <Eviltwin> Event listeners bind to elements that exist
[08:52:33] <xec> AdvoWork: .on() is new in 1.7
[08:53:19] <whoever_> xec: android
[08:53:56] <xec> whoever_: how is the original function bound? i don't see why it wouldn't work on android
[08:54:17] <xec> whoever_: does it work in desktop browsers?
[08:54:35] <AdvoWork> danzik171, i mean, before i had: $("#change_date_expected").click(function(event){  and it didnt work, changing it to delegate works
[08:54:41] <paulk-desktop> hi
[08:55:05] <paulk-desktop> is there a way to get the n th found element that belongs to a specified to a class?
[08:55:09] <xec> AdvoWork: did you see what Eviltwin wrote?
[08:55:14] <paulk-desktop> to a class*
[08:55:42] <paulk-desktop> like getElementsByClassName("class")[n]
[08:56:21] <danzik171> AdvoWork: need to look up event delegation - i gotta run tho, bbl.
[08:56:29] <whoever_> xec: its onclick but it only seem to work on android if i bind
[08:57:11] <whoever_> xec: so its $("#Helpbtn").click(...)
[08:58:03] <xec> paulk-desktop: if you need the DOM element you can use [n] behind the jquery collection (or .get())
[08:58:17] <paulk-desktop> no I want the jquery object
[08:58:29] <xec> paulk-desktop: then you can use .eq()
[08:59:00] <xec> paulk-desktop: http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[08:59:31] <paulk-desktop> thanks a lot xec!
[09:00:16] <xec> np :)
[09:01:12] <xec> whoever_: yeah, i would recommend binding events in js code rather than onclick="" in html for just about any situation, really
[09:03:00] <versatiletech> sorcerer86pt_: got it under control?
[09:03:14] <sorcerer86pt_> still modifying the code
[09:03:29] <sorcerer86pt_> was to seeing the jquery data function
[09:03:58] <whoever_> xec: so basicly write my jquery agin in js?  or call js and "getelementbyID(BTNNAME) == TRE"
[09:04:26] <xec> whoever_: sorry if i confused you; jquery *is* js code
[09:04:48] <xec> whoever_: i was comparing to html, seeing as you said "onclick"
[09:07:16] <elixir> Hello. Can anyone tell me how to run jQuery in Cloud9 IDE ?
[09:09:29] <whoever_> xec:  I think I may had confused u , when i said onclick i mean .click
[09:09:40] <Eviltwin> Then don't call it onclick
[09:10:20] <Sidnicious> Hey, I donâ€™t have too much experience with jQuery UI. Can plugins like sortable be used with delegation, or do they need to be applied to elements in advance?
[09:11:01] <tokam> hello I have a bug here with IE8. The error console shows an error. https://www.seolista.de/user/register
[09:11:21] <xec> whoever_: if you can't figure it out, create a testcase at jsfiddle.net and give us the url, maybe someone has an android phone and time to help
[09:11:40] <tokam> With other browsers all works fine. The expected behaviour is that if you select in the dropdown for the field Umsatzsteuerpflicht: Ja, some more fields appear
[09:12:58] <Loge_> Hi
[09:14:27] <elixir> Can anyone help me ? I am not able  to run jQuery in cloud9 IDE.
[09:15:58] <WebDragon> I'm just curious if there's a better way to do this : http://pastebin.com/8muJG8Nf - in particular, line 5
[09:16:58] <WebDragon> it works, but 'works' isn't everything :)
[09:17:03] <xec> WebDragon: could you explain what this snippet is doing?
[09:17:25] <Loge_> Hi everybody
[09:17:30] <Loge_> i need  helop
[09:17:40] <Loge_> someone can help me?
[09:17:55] <bot-t> Loge_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:18:07] <xec> WebDragon: .minithumb is an <img>, i assume?
[09:18:20] <WebDragon> xec: I have a sidebar ul with a list of a[href] links that is a fancybox image group. in the content are three mini thumbs that when clicked, find the correct image in the sidebar and trigger a click on it thus opening the fancybox with the correct sidebar image, but allowing the photogroup to be part of the fancybox
[09:19:09] <WebDragon> so they can move from image-to-image in the lightbox, but this way they start with the correct image without me needing to build multiple fancyboxes
[09:19:38] <MrGando> Hey guys, I'm trying to make a transition for addClass, basically I have $("#main-information-container").addClass("span-two-thirds"); where "span-two-thirds" sets the width to 600px , how could I make a nice transition when I add that class to main-information-container ?
[09:19:51] <xec> sorry, haven't worked much with fancybox so this doesn't make too much sense to me i'm afraid =/
[09:20:17] <xec> i would have thought the plugin would allow you to choose where to start
[09:20:40] <WebDragon> xec: http://devel.w-m-t.com/Products/Packed_Columns.php
[09:21:13] <WebDragon> the plugin does allow you to choose where you start -- with the ul.photos li a[href] -- however the three minithumbs are NOT contained in that ul
[09:21:25] <WebDragon> hence, the code in the pastebin
[09:21:51] <xec> aha, i see
[09:22:17] <WebDragon> my concern is solely whether I'm using the best method of finding a particular a[href] inside a ul so I can trigger a click on it
[09:22:27] <WebDragon> that has nothing to do with the fancybox itself
[09:23:53] <xec> WebDragon: i don't see anything wrong with that tbh
[09:24:32] <scratcha> hey all, i have a navigation menu drawn using an unsorted list. I'm trying to use query to remove the 'active' class from the current page and add 'active' class to the target page when clicked. it works successfully for the first click, but from then on fails to work. bare in mind its loading through ajax, so the page isn't refreshing. heres the code http://pastie.org/3167318
[09:30:32] <nFFF> Guys need to check to see if this.class() contains 'styled'
[09:30:41] <nFFF> whats the correct conditional statemnt
[09:30:42] <Eviltwin> ?hasClass @ nFFF
[09:30:43] <bot-t> nFFF, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[09:30:56] <nFFF> jquery blows my mind function by function :P
[09:37:47] <tokam> why is jquery using addEventlistener instead of attachEvent here on the form element using IE8 https://www.seolista.de/user/register
[09:39:22] <tokam> i get the error in my jquery package.
[09:39:26] <Eviltwin> jQuery uses .attachEvent if .addEventListener doesn't exist
[09:39:39] <Eviltwin> Well using the minified version is really going to help you track down the error
[09:39:55] <tokam> does jquery send different content depending on the browser threw the cdn?
[09:40:07] <tokam> I just copy pasted the code from the jquery cdn and hosted it on my server
[09:40:23] <Eviltwin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L117-122
[09:40:49] <Eviltwin> Use the unminified version for development and the minifed version for production
[09:40:52] <Eviltwin> It's not that hard to do
[09:47:43] <Doggie52> I am unable to apply the CSS attribute "color" to the sfHover class created by Superfish, however I am able to apply background-color and a lot of other attributes. Why is this?
[09:48:59] <jetienne_> how to load a .js without running it ?
[09:49:08] <Eviltwin> Doggie52: Sounds like #css issue
[09:49:18] <Eviltwin> jetienne_: Is it on the same server?
[09:49:29] <jetienne_> Eviltwin: yes
[09:49:40] <Eviltwin> see ?$.get
[09:49:41] <bot-t> Eviltwin, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[09:49:45] <Doggie52> Eviltwin, nah I doubt it. It makes no sense whatsoever :S
[09:49:51] <jetienne_> Eviltwin: this is running the .js
[09:49:56] <jetienne_> Eviltwin: this is what i use rright now
[09:50:16] <NoiseEee> Doggie52: likely that something in "Superfish" css is overwriting what you're styling.
[09:50:30] <NoiseEee> Doggie52: open up your dev console, inspect the element
[09:50:49] <NoiseEee> css rule precedents and all that
[09:51:06] <Doggie52> NoiseEee, I've been there, done that. I'll check again
[09:51:40] <NoiseEee> Doggie52: otherwise replicate on jsfiddle
[09:52:40] <Doggie52> NoiseEee, I'll try that too
[10:01:08] <Doggie52> NoiseEee, lol, not even on the Superfish example page it works
[10:01:45] <Doggie52> Putting a color:#000; on the sfHover class makes the text black when hovered upon but not when you've moved your mouse down to the dropdown
[10:01:51] <Doggie52> But the background stays as it should
[10:10:32] <muzone> Eviltwin: greetings man, any chance we can wrap this thing up today?
[10:18:17] <ansimation> i have this page here http://173.168.172.225/rspline/portfolio-category/interactive/ that calls a script. on document.ready it outputs a line 'foo' to the console. trying to figure out why it doesnt stay in the console it disappears quickly
[10:18:52] <ansimation> however if you visit this page, http://173.168.172.225/rspline/portfolio/interactive-image/ it stays in the console like it should
[10:21:47] <ansimation> http://pastebin.com/ZW5VqneL - there's my js
[10:33:36] <Amixbook> hello
[10:33:46] <Amixbook> I need some help at www.distrita.com
[10:34:05] <Amixbook> ive tried to add Nivo Slider and a jquery countdown box
[10:34:13] <Amixbook> but there is no movement
[10:34:19] <Amixbook> is there any solution?
[10:39:45] <nicholasschulz> Anyone who recommends a text editor? Free.
[10:39:47] <nicholasschulz> For mac
[10:39:56] <Eviltwin> `emacs` `vi`
[10:42:14] <khmer_> nicholasschulz: sublime text
[10:42:24] <khmer_> nicholasschulz: though you should try emacs or vi
[10:43:39] <nicholasschulz> Ok. Thanks.
[10:46:50] <nicholasschulz> How do you open a FTP connection on Emacs?
[10:46:58] <nicholasschulz> Cant find a "connect" anywhere
[10:47:03] <Eviltwin> `ftp`
[10:48:00] <Eviltwin> You know FTP doesn't support editing a file, right?
[10:48:18] <Eviltwin> You have to GET/PUT
[10:48:58] <nicholasschulz> What do you mean? I have used Coda for years and there I log into my remote server and edit the files..
[10:49:21] <Eviltwin> No, you can't. It's actually downloading the whole file, editing it, and reuploading the whole file each time
[10:49:38] <Eviltwin> You might want to look at something like this: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AngeFtp
[10:50:30] <nicholasschulz> Ok. Coda was a lot more efficient than emacs then
[10:50:36] <Eviltwin> What?
[10:50:55] <Eviltwin> I just told you exactly what Coda does
[10:52:13] <WellWisher> i had seen that fade in and fade out functions are executed when there is an event only like click. cant we make it fadein fadeout on page loads?
[10:52:20] <WellWisher> automatically
[10:52:39] <nicholasschulz> Yes, but if I manually have to do the uploading of the file each time with Emacs, then Coda was more efficient because it did it automatically.
[10:53:12] <Eviltwin> nicholasschulz: Why don't you just mount the FTP volume?
[10:53:28] <Eviltwin> ?g ftpfs @ nicholasschulz
[10:53:29] <bot-t> nicholasschulz, FTPFS - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTPFS
[10:54:09] <Eviltwin> WellWisher: Sure
[10:54:17] <Eviltwin> Do it on $(document).ready
[10:54:27] <pcperini> hey, is there any reason why the $() function wouldn't appear in a rendered page? likeâ€¦ just disappear?
[10:54:52] <Eviltwin> ?noConflict @ pcperini
[10:54:52] <bot-t> pcperini, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[10:56:02] <pcperini> Eviltwin: ok, i'll give this a look. thanks
[10:59:52] <Jonno_FTW> hello
[11:03:11] <Jonno_FTW> I have a form that I wish to submit using $("form").submit, but I don't want the action of the <form> to be anytihng since  I just want to send data and stay on the page
[11:03:50] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:04:00] <Jonno_FTW> thanks
[11:07:19] <nicholasschulz> Eviltwin: Got Coda to work again, thank godâ€¦ :-p
[11:40:28] <byebyebyezzz> I am trying to run a slide show using jquery but I have problem with the prev() function
[11:40:51] <byebyebyezzz> how can I find out when I am at the last image?
[11:41:02] <byebyebyezzz> I meant
[11:41:04] <byebyebyezzz> first image
[11:41:20] <Eviltwin> Check if it's .prev().length === 0
[11:42:48] <sublimenal> hey there i got a quick question is it possible to change the id of a form then submit it? I'm having a problem. for instance      jQuery(div).attr('id', 'finished');   jQuery('#finished').submit();
[11:43:31] <Eviltwin> You can
[11:43:34] <Eviltwin> But why would you want to?
[11:45:11] <sublimenal> i have a seperate function that i want to use on many forms instead of rewriting it that opens a dialog box and asks them a different question based on which forms are validated. the Dialog then asks question that gives two different results but the submit() is already returned so calling submit() on the same div would just loop the same function
[11:48:19] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/Kjwcf/
[11:48:26] <nicholasschulz> Does === mean the same as != ?
[11:48:31] <rethus> why the errormessages are not replaced ?
[11:48:33] <NoiseEee> ummmm
[11:48:40] <rethus> nicholasschulz no
[11:48:40] <danzik17> nicholasschulz: not even close to the same thing.
[11:48:57] <rethus> === compare type AND value
[11:48:57] <nicholasschulz> Ok :-p What is === ?
[11:49:09] <danzik17> nicholasschulz: strict equality checking
[11:49:27] <danzik17> nicholasschulz: ( no type conversion  as with == )
[11:49:31] <rethus> string 3 === int 3  result in false
[11:49:43] <rethus> exactly
[11:50:04] <nicholasschulz> Oh ok, thanks ;-) No wonder my code didn't work.
[11:50:43] <rethus> why the messages are not replaced on this code? http://jsfiddle.net/Kjwcf/
[11:54:58] <SinnerNyx> when i'm authoring a plugin that is to be used on multiple controls in a single page, where should i be storing my data variables so that they are unique for each instance. Also where would I be storing my data variables that I want to be accessible as a single instance to all plugin instances (equivalent to static variable in C#).
[11:55:11] <sublimenal> one more question is it possible to run a custom function once the form is validated using jquery validation?
[11:58:27] <someprimetime> what is the benefit of using .data() vs. attr()?
[11:58:38] <Eviltwin> .data allows you to store arbitrary data
[11:58:44] <Eviltwin> You can put other elements in there if you want
[11:59:40] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: so right now i am specifying <div class="foobar" data-row-size="2"> and retrieving that value by going $('.foobar').data('row-size'); is this the correct way to to do so?
[11:59:57] <feyd> I'm looking to have a forever scrolling tiled background image, just need it to scroll horizontally. I can easily picture how to animate the position to go left to right, but now clue how to loop it
[12:00:26] <SinnerNyx> someprimetime: I don't think so.. data isn't supposed to show up in the html to my knowledge.
[12:01:09] <SinnerNyx> in that case use attr or don't specify the data as an attribute
[12:02:00] <fris> if 1.6> use prop
[12:02:14] <someprimetime> SinnerNyx: alright good to know thanks
[12:05:02] <ph88> i need to have a popup that is an overlay of the current website (background in shadow) then submit a form there and then with ajax change a little thingy on the main website ... what's the best way to go about this ?
[12:05:25] <someprimetime> SinnerNyx: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/when-to-use-attr-vs-data according to this, "data" is best used when getting/setting dynamic application state, which i'm doing in my case
[12:05:30] <someprimetime> (or so I believe).
[12:05:51] <SinnerNyx> someprimetime: if it were dynamic you wouldn't be using html to define it
[12:06:04] <someprimetime> ah so server side dynamic
[12:06:05] <SinnerNyx> someprimetime: you'd be using the data method to define it
[12:06:07] <someprimetime> gotcha
[12:06:14] <astropirate> ph88: look at some jquery Modal plugins
[12:06:34] <astropirate> actually jquery ui comes with 1 kind, but i think y ou want something different
[12:06:35] <danzik17> someprimetime: using a "data-foo-bar" attribute, you can access it via .data( "fooBar" )
[12:06:40] <ph88> Modal ... okay
[12:06:51] <someprimetime> danzik17: right, which is what i was doing
[12:07:05] <SinnerNyx> someprimetime: danzik17 appears to know about this data attrib. I didn't know it could be done like that
[12:07:09] <someprimetime> wouldn't that also be .data('foo-bar') in your example?
[12:07:23] <someprimetime> or it actually can convert to camel case like that?
[12:07:32] <danzik17> someprimetime: i forget if it's supported like that, but internally it can be converted to camelCase
[12:07:51] <SinnerNyx> when i'm authoring a plugin that is to be used on multiple controls in a single page, where should i be storing my data variables so that they are unique for each instance? Also where would I be storing my data variables that I want to be accessible as a single instance to all plugin instances (equivalent to static variable in C#)?
[12:08:21] <someprimetime> SinnerNyx: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[12:08:22] <astropirate> SinnerNyx:  use jquery's  .data()  method for storing data
[12:08:49] <fris> SinnerNyx you mean so it can be chained?
[12:09:01] <someprimetime> SinnerNyx: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Data
[12:10:37] <SinnerNyx> astropirate, I'm doing that. is it considered good practice to use data() on the body for the 'static' variables?
[12:11:14] <astropirate> SinnerNyx: you can set  "static"/global variables that you wish to share for all of the plugin instances on the object itself
[12:11:26] <astropirate> it depends on how you structure your plugin data
[12:11:43] <astropirate> but there is no need to attach it to the DOM
[12:11:46] <ph88> can anyone recommend me a jQuery Modal plugin ?
[12:12:02] <ph88> there are so many :|
[12:12:41] <fris> ph88 http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/
[12:12:47] <aximilation> I've used colorbox for a while
[12:12:51] <astropirate> ph88: if you aren't in a hurry make yoru own :D  you will learn much and they are easy to do
[12:12:54] <SinnerNyx> astropirate: so it'd be jQuery.fn.foo.globalvar?
[12:13:08] <ph88> im in a hurry :\
[12:13:15] <astropirate> SinnerNyx: sure you could do that
[12:13:20] <aximilation> http://projects.nickstakenburg.com/lightview was hosted on HN the other day
[12:13:32] <lxsameer> i want to run a function for each X second, X changes each time, how can i do that?
[12:13:36] <fris> must be a new project of nicks?
[12:13:49] <astropirate> Hacker News what would we do without that mac fanboy infested site???!
[12:13:51] <aximilation> I was considering that versus my previous use of http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/
[12:14:00] <aximilation> hah
[12:14:35] <aximilation> Where would the world be without fanboys?
[12:14:46] <aximilation> trolling would be so much harder, that's for sure.
[12:14:52] <gibson042> .
[12:14:55] <astropirate> yes :(
[12:15:17] <astropirate> fanboys are fine... (realatively)  apple fanboys are the absolute worst
[12:15:39] <astropirate> the devils spawns
[12:15:48] <aximilation> they can be, for sure
[12:16:01] <fris> will have to try that, i already use tipped, great plugin
[12:16:03] <railbait_lite> Have to turn that around on them. "And you know, Apple does have the _best_ sweatshops also."
[12:16:16] <astropirate> railbait_lite: LOLOL
[12:16:37] <railbait_lite> Sweet little hands make sweet little phones
[12:17:46] <rethus> how can i set validate to put the message in a div instead a lable tag?
[12:18:41] <ph88> does somebody know a good jQuery ajax tutorial ? I have a form on my website but there are too many boxes to display, so i need a css popup to display more boxes (when a button on the main website was clicked) then result of the css popup form should be saved in database and displayed on the website (where the main form is)
[12:18:45] <aximilation> rethus: element.html()?
[12:19:02] <ph88> sorry im a JS-noobie .. i know what i want it to look like though
[12:19:10] <rethus> may be a option for validate, but i didn't remember which one
[12:20:09] <aximilation> what exactly do you mean by validate? Function, plugin?
[12:20:34] <rethus> plugin
[12:21:00] <aximilation> link?
[12:21:17] <aximilation> to the plugin, that is
[12:21:44] <rethus> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation#List_of_built-in_Validation_methods
[12:23:27] <andrew9183> http://jsbin.com/urekoz/edit#javascript,html
[12:23:36] <andrew9183> how do i make the caption stop fading in and out when im hovering over it ?
[12:25:05] <aximilation> rethus: you want to use the invalidHandler
[12:26:28] <rethus> didn't find such a handler
[12:27:04] <aximilation> it's in the docs: http://pastebin.com/UcGRiUVt
[12:27:09] <aximilation> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions
[12:27:37] <patrick99e99> is there a way to do $('body').click( ... ) but not have it get triggered by clicking on certain elements..?  Like is there a $('body:not-#foo').click ?
[12:28:16] <aximilation> patrick99e99: It sounds like you're talking about event bubbling
[12:28:27] <rethus> k, thanks a lot
[12:28:29] <patrick99e99> aximilation: yeah.....
[12:28:34] <aximilation> I saw an article on that yesterday, lemme see if I can find it
[12:28:40] <aximilation> np rethus :D
[12:29:08] <naton> patrick99e99: you could add another click event on the ":not" elements, telling them to not propagate the clicks
[12:29:49] <naton> like $('#foo').click(function() { event.stopPropagation(); });
[12:30:13] <aximilation> $(selector).click(function(e){e.preventDefault()});
[12:30:27] <Eviltwin> preveentDefault is something else
[12:30:39] <patrick99e99> hmm neither of those seem to work
[12:30:42] <aximilation> yea that is, not sure where that article is
[12:30:57] <patrick99e99> oh wait
[12:31:01] <patrick99e99> because I was doing it on body not on #foo
[12:31:13] <aximilation> what I pasted doesn't work in ie6 from what I see.
[12:31:23] <patrick99e99> hmm
[12:31:28] <patrick99e99> no not working.....
[12:31:56] <andrew9183> anyone know ?
[12:32:19] <astropirate> andrew9183: know what?
[12:32:24] <aximilation> Take a look here: http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[12:32:25] <patrick99e99> so I have a textfield, and I have a $('body').click(function() { console.log('hello') } )
[12:32:33] <andrew9183> how do i make the caption stop fading in and out when im hovering over it ?
[12:32:37] <andrew9183> http://jsbin.com/urekoz/edit#javascript,html
[12:32:47] <patrick99e99> and then I tried to do $(textfield).click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); e.preventDefault(); ... } )
[12:32:50] <andrew9183> i have to use the hover on the image.
[12:32:55] <andrew9183> can't do ".edit-image"
[12:33:01] <patrick99e99> but clicking on the textfield still outputs "hello"
[12:33:19] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ patrick99e99
[12:33:19] <bot-t> patrick99e99, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[12:34:29] <andrew9183> hey evil :)
[12:34:37] <astropirate> andrew9183: .edit-wrapper isn't the parent of .image
[12:34:44] <astropirate> so its not effected by the hover
[12:34:59] <astropirate> it wont' make the image hide or anything
[12:37:05] <andrew9183> but when i hover over .edit-wrapper on top of .image the mouseleave event is called because i'm not hovering over .image anymore, right ?
[12:37:55] <astropirate> andrew9183: yup
[12:38:19] <astropirate> you give them a common parent and have the hover event attached to that maybe?
[12:38:27] <astropirate> that way it won't leave it
[12:39:08] <andrew9183> yeah that's the ideal solution, but my image tags are added dynamically and have a custom attribute attached to it which i use to identify for the hover.
[12:39:10] <andrew9183> hmm
[12:39:59] <astropirate> andrew9183: you can use .live  instead of .hover
[12:40:18] <astropirate> with that you can attach events even if the element isn't in the dom yet
[12:40:40] <djQuery> andrew9183, $('img[attibutename]').hover(function(){}, function(){});
[12:41:12] <andrew9183> astropirate: oh neat
[12:41:45] <andrew9183> i'm thinking of having an if statement on the event e to only fade out when e leaves the parent div
[12:41:51] <andrew9183> would that work ?
[12:42:53] <astropirate> it would but i'm sure there is a more elegant way of doing it :p which i cna't think of because i'm working on very complicated problem myself :p

[12:44:35] <djQuery> andrew9183, got any exmplate code on say jsfiddle or whatnot
[12:44:51] <djQuery> and fingers arent workin today
[12:44:57] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ andrew9183

[12:45:02] <andrew9183> i did !
[12:45:09] <andrew9183> well, not jsfiddle.. doesnt work well for me
[12:45:12] <Eviltwin> ...
[12:45:14] <djQuery> well I just got here mind posting again
[12:45:16] <andrew9183> http://jsbin.com/urekoz/edit#javascript,html
[12:45:18] <Eviltwin> Then GTFO! :P
[12:45:21] <andrew9183> lol
[12:45:25] <andrew9183> jsbin acceptable?
[12:45:31] <andrew9183> if not, ill fiddle my fingers
[12:49:01] <Mkop> GAH
[12:49:16] <aximilation> GAH!
[12:49:25] <Mkop> I've been bitten once again by ["foo",/*"bar"*/].length being wrong in IE
[12:51:02] <Eviltwin> Maybe you should stop doing that
[12:54:08] <andrew9183> should i fiddle it ?
[12:55:51] <Eviltwin> Yes
[12:57:34] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/pkxze/
[12:58:02] <Eviltwin> So what was the problem?
[12:58:19] <andrew9183> if i hover over the caption, it blinks in and out
[12:58:34] <andrew9183> is there a way to prevent it from blinking, without changing the hover object ?
[12:58:50] <ph88> how do i prevent a form from reloading the whole page but just send the data ? (ajax ?)
[12:59:02] <muzone> Eviltwin: think you'll have time later today perhaps?
[12:59:09] <muzone> sorry if im nagging
[12:59:51] <Eviltwin> muzone: I was going to do it last night but my internet had epic lag
[13:00:01] <Eviltwin> After waiting 2 minutes for a connection to open, I gave up
[13:00:34] <muzone> hehe
[13:00:45] <djQuery> andrew9183 are you calling .stop before calling fadeIn so that you dont get the items qued up
[13:01:03] * muzone has anger management issues from too much lagging
[13:01:15] <muzone> couple of weeks ago i couldnt take it any longer and smashed my precious macbook pro to pieces
[13:01:38] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: http://jsfiddle.net/pkxze/3/
[13:01:40] <muzone> luckily i woke up and found out it was only a dream :-)
[13:02:39] <djQuery> brb
[13:03:41] <djQuery> andreq9183 http://jsfiddle.net/pkxze/10/
[13:04:04] <Eviltwin> djQuery: I got there 7 updates ago
[13:04:10] <andrew9183> Eviltwin: thanks.  is there a way to do it without changing the hover object
[13:04:17] <andrew9183> probably bad structure, and i know you'll yell at me for it
[13:04:43] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/pkxze/11/
[13:05:13] <andrew9183> dude you rock Eviltwin
[13:05:55] <andrew9183> is there a way to do it without even modifying the hover at all ?
[13:06:00] <andrew9183> just wondering :P
[13:12:02] <DukeDrake> will .removeClass("xyz") remove xyz only from the selected element or from all children elements?
[13:12:46] <Xerex> .
[13:12:56] <kenthree> not children, unless the results include them too
[13:13:05] <DukeDrake> ok
[13:21:13] <enikm4> what would the code look like to add an option to a select
[13:24:16] <warrenparsons> enikm4: .append() should work
[13:24:30] <enikm4> hrmm i tried append like this and it doesn't work sec
[13:24:44] <warrenparsons> $('#mySelect).append('<option>blah</option>');
[13:25:22] <warrenparsons> enikm4: http://jsfiddle.net/cPwCg/
[13:25:25] <enikm4> oh okay
[13:25:29] <enikm4> i did it a little different
[13:27:38] <enikm4> warrenparsons, thanks !
[13:27:44] <warrenparsons> enikm4: Sure.
[13:27:44] <Eviltwin> muzone: Sorry, could you relink me the fiddle
[13:27:51] <Eviltwin> If you have it handy
[13:27:57] <Eviltwin> Otherwise I can search my logs
[13:32:21] <muzone> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/26/
[13:35:55] <DukeDrake> hi
[13:36:36] <DukeDrake> I need some basic hints on how to structurize data for being able to search it easily
[13:37:26] <patrick99e99> is there a jquery function that submits a form with ajax?  or do I have to manually use $.post / $.ajax, etc and get the location out of the form like "url: $('form').attr('action') "  ?
[13:38:05] <DukeDrake> currently I have elements #xyz_1 through #xyz_10 with data like #xyz_1.data("name", "foo") and #xyz_10.data("name", "bar")
[13:44:19] <jeromewild684> I'm trying to split the html output of the element... it is working but adds a bunch of methods and the end.. I don't know where they are coming from... any thoughts??
[13:46:29] <Eviltwin> muzone: Haven't commented but is this correct? http://jsfiddle.net/WHxhx/27/
[13:54:05] <muzone> Eviltwin: that is exactly what i had in mind !!
[13:54:19] <muzone> tears of joy man
[13:54:31] <muzone> pouring down my face for real..
[13:55:26] <ch3mical> o_O
[13:58:29] <NackNick> can someone take a look at my code, for some reason its throwing off errors on my site http://pastebin.com/vmu9VhDL
[13:58:43] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ NackNick
[13:58:43] <bot-t> NackNick, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[13:59:13] <NackNick> lol nice
[13:59:52] <NackNick> well this is the error im getting with my code im using Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[13:59:55] <muzone> Eviltwin: so are you coming to polynesia?
[14:00:04] <NackNick> i finally found where the error was coming from
[14:00:08] <muzone> Eviltwin: ill make sure you're given a proper greeting: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5tgEbZzB8E
[14:00:20] <NackNick> and my code isnt hundreds of lines
[14:00:25] <NackNick> just 58...
[14:00:33] <Eviltwin> It's not 12
[14:00:50] <NackNick> thats because 58 is btter
[14:01:00] <Eviltwin> We charge per line over
[14:01:02] <NackNick> almost 69 *wink wink*
[14:01:08] <muzone> NackNick: hehe
[14:01:21] <ch3mical> muzone, "polynesia" is not a place, it's a region of pacfic islands. Are you asking him to show up at random on one of the hundreds of islands?
[14:01:28] <ch3mical> pacific*
[14:01:53] <NackNick> how much perline evil, just curious
[14:01:59] <ch3mical> NackNick, $300
[14:02:07] <NackNick> you have lost your damn mind
[14:02:12] <Eviltwin> $58 by a staggering coincedence
[14:02:22] <astropirate> french polynesia is a place
[14:02:29] <muzone> haha nah i got a place
[14:02:32] <NackNick> $58 per line?
[14:02:36] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:02:45] <muzone> not too different from http://www.sofitel.com/gb/discovering-sofitel-hotel/french-polynesia.shtml actually
[14:02:47] <NackNick> i doubt it
[14:02:55] <ch3mical> astropirate, incorrect, French polynesia is also a group of islands
[14:02:57] <muzone> except it doesnt cost $7000/night
[14:03:08] <Eviltwin> Actually what happens is the probability of us ignoring you goes through the roof
[14:03:18] <astropirate> ch3mical: dirty lies
[14:03:21] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ NackNick
[14:03:21] <bot-t> NackNick, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[14:03:30] <ch3mical> astropirate, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Polynesia
[14:03:43] <ch3mical> "made up of several groups of Polynesian islands"
[14:03:47] <astropirate> ch3mical: s an overseas country of the French Republic
[14:03:48] <NackNick> that would consist of posting my whole site in js fiddle
[14:04:02] <NackNick> do you want the url instead?
[14:04:03] <Eviltwin> NackNick: Dude, learn to debug
[14:04:05] <astropirate> ch3mical: its a good link, you should read it :p
[14:04:06] <ch3mical> Yeah, it's a country. A country isn't necessarily one land mass
[14:04:06] <Eviltwin> Fine
[14:04:14] <Eviltwin> That was in the demo message BTW
[14:04:16] <ch3mical> I did read it, that's how I know you're wrong. lol
[14:04:24] <astropirate> ch3mical: thats not the point, you said its not a country
[14:04:36] <astropirate> EAT. IT.
[14:04:38] <NackNick> i do know how to debug I just sometimes over look things
[14:04:39] <astropirate> MUAHAH
[14:04:46] <NackNick> loans.org is the url
[14:04:49] <ch3mical> So if you say "come to French Polynesia" should I just got to Tahiti? What if you're no where near that particular island?
[14:05:14] <ch3mical> astropirate, I said it's not a "place" in the strictest sense that it's "many places"
[14:05:23] <ch3mical> I never said anything about Polynesia being a country
[14:05:40] <muzone> ch3mical: *you're* not going anywhere :-)
[14:05:47] <muzone> Eviltwin is, if he wants too
[14:06:02] <Eviltwin> NackNick: ...
[14:06:04] <Eviltwin> <script type="text/javascript" src="?lxnmqm"></script>
[14:06:08] <ch3mical> muzone, new flash: I don't need your permission to go anywhere. lol
[14:06:16] <astropirate> ch3mical: your jedi ways won't work on me
[14:06:19] <muzone> heheh
[14:06:20] <Eviltwin> THAT was your problem
[14:06:23] <ch3mical> astropirate, :)
[14:06:43] <Eviltwin> My debugger pointed me right to that
[14:06:46] <muzone> ch3mical: its one of the islands in vanuatu
[14:06:51] <Eviltwin> So whatever debugger you're using is a POS
[14:06:51] <muzone> i could meet y'all in tahiti though
[14:06:54] <NackNick> yeah but im not generating that in my code
[14:07:12] <Eviltwin> NackNick: Dude, it's here in the source for http://loans.org/
[14:07:24] <NackNick> i know exactly where it is
[14:07:35] <velts> has anyone ever forked the jquery ui repo?
[14:07:36] <muzone> once i get this shop up and running and everything goes according to plan - i'll be throwing a freenode beach party and invite all of y'all to come. and pay for your tickets too. food, drinks, women, maybe some weed
[14:07:36] <NackNick> but its not anywhere in my code
[14:07:40] <muzone> to show my thanks
[14:07:46] <muzone> but for now..
[14:08:02] <Eviltwin> NackNick: WTF are you going on about now?
[14:08:06] <Eviltwin> You know where it is but it's not there?
[14:08:10] <NackNick> if you would look at it you would scratch your head and say thats odd
[14:08:10] <muzone> Eviltwin: man this code is so amaiazing
[14:08:30] <Eviltwin> muzone: Just don't forget your pledge: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255 :P
[14:08:33] <ch3mical> muzone, I won't be attending. I prefer parties that exist in the real world.
[14:08:41] <NackNick> i know what the debug is saying and I know how the code is getting there i just dont know why its being created
[14:08:45] <muzone> Eviltwin: i wont man i promise
[14:09:03] <muzone> ch3mical: are you saying im not a man of my word?
[14:09:07] <Eviltwin> That's your problem
[14:09:10] <Eviltwin> And a backend problem
[14:09:12] <Eviltwin> Not a jQuery problem
[14:09:12] <NackNick> ...
[14:09:13] <ch3mical> muzone, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[14:09:23] <NackNick> your almost no help
[14:09:38] <NackNick> ALMOST!
[14:09:40] <muzone> hehe
[14:09:54] <ch3mical> NackNick, most people say "thanks"
[14:09:56] <ch3mical> lol
[14:10:02] <Eviltwin> Do you know what happens when you include <script type="text/javascript" src="?lxnmqm"></script> ?
[14:10:07] <NackNick> thats if it was actually solved lol
[14:10:13] <NackNick> yes
[14:10:17] <Eviltwin> It tries to load the current URL as a script
[14:10:21] <Eviltwin> Which is wrong
[14:10:28] <NackNick> its including a script that doesnt exsist
[14:10:37] <NackNick> yeah i know that
[14:10:41] <Eviltwin> And the current URL is the HTML of the page
[14:10:49] <Eviltwin> And that pages begins with...wait for it...a "<"
[14:11:04] <ch3mical> *boom*
[14:11:05] <Eviltwin> Sounds familiar?
[14:11:11] <aaronpeterson> Hey yall.  I noticed I can't use concat() on jquery lists.  How can I concatenate two lists?
[14:11:14] <Eviltwin> An error relating to a "<"
[14:11:23] <Eviltwin> aaronpeterson: see ?.add
[14:11:24] <bot-t> aaronpeterson, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[14:11:45] <DukeDrake> hi
[14:11:53] <astropirate> DukeDrake: HIII!!
[14:11:53] <aaronpeterson> Eviltwin: Thanks!
[14:12:05] <astropirate> DukeDrake: where've you been man?
[14:12:06] * NackNick still feels like your not getting the point
[14:12:14] <Eviltwin> Do you have one?
[14:12:16] <DukeDrake> how would I go best about when programming a search in jquery? i.e. structuring data?
[14:12:25] <DukeDrake> astropirate: errrr ...
[14:12:27] <NackNick> ok scratch that
[14:12:34] <NackNick> let me ask something simplier
[14:12:47] <NackNick> what the best way to debug using ie7
[14:12:55] <Eviltwin> To shoot yourself in the forehead
[14:12:57] <astropirate> alert()
[14:13:10] <ch3mical> format c: /y
[14:13:15] <Eviltwin> The best way to debug using IE7 is to use it to download Google Chrome and debug there
[14:13:23] <ch3mical> lol
[14:13:29] <NackNick> it doesnt show up in chrome...
[14:13:35] <NackNick> only in ie7
[14:13:38] <astropirate> overlord billgates does not approve of where this conversation is going
[14:13:40] <Eviltwin> It just showed up for me in Chrome
[14:13:42] <ch3mical> "IE: the number one browser for downloading a better browser"
[14:13:49] <NackNick> ill take that error off
[14:13:58] <Eviltwin> This is probably a cache issue with IE7
[14:14:27] <NackNick> i wish it was
[14:14:30] <NackNick> but it isnt
[14:14:40] <NackNick> ok that error is gone
[14:14:58] <NackNick> the error is also gone in ie 8 and 9
[14:15:07] <NackNick> as well as ff and chrome
[14:15:14] <NackNick> just stupid ie7 keeps showing something
[14:15:16] <Eviltwin> So...it isn't but it is?
[14:15:18] <Eviltwin> I don't understand
[14:15:35] <NackNick> the error is gone in all browsers except ie7
[14:15:45] <Eviltwin> And you claim it's the same erorr?
[14:15:46] <Eviltwin> error*
[14:15:58] <NackNick> didnt say it was the same one
[14:16:04] <NackNick> I just said its errors
[14:16:04] <Eviltwin> ...
[14:16:06] <Eviltwin> "the error"
[14:16:10] <Eviltwin> You just used "the error"
[14:16:27] <NackNick> a error is a error i never specified which one
[14:16:47] <Eviltwin> "the error is gone in all browsers except ie7"
[14:16:50] <NackNick> thats like looking at 4 cans and someone says give me that can
[14:16:51] <Eviltwin> Guess which error we've been talking about
[14:16:55] <NackNick> you would be like ok which one
[14:17:30] <NackNick> evil evil evil...
[14:17:35] <NackNick> i see why you have this name
[14:18:11] <Eviltwin> Don't go blaming me for your mistakes
[14:18:19] <NackNick> im not blaming at all
[14:18:37] <NackNick> however I have errors in only ie7 and no where else
[14:18:45] <Eviltwin> Okay, what errors?
[14:19:42] <NackNick> expected identifier, string or number
[14:19:52] <Eviltwin> Do you know which file?
[14:20:24] <NackNick> no it doesnt say, and invalid procedure call or arguement
[14:20:31] <DukeDrake> is this still #jquery? ;)
[14:20:39] <NackNick> yes -_-
[14:20:54] <Eviltwin> Binary search with alerts until you find where the issue is
[14:22:54] <NackNick> ok i found which file it is
[14:23:25] <NackNick> is there a debugging site?
[14:24:08] <NackNick> i have one
[14:26:13] <muzone> Eviltwin: really curious to learn more about this code of yours
[14:26:19] <muzone> got time to throw in some quick comments?
[14:26:34] <NackNick> thank you eviltwin
[14:29:27] <b1lly> lets say i wanted to
[14:29:39] <b1lly> i had elements
[14:29:42] <muzone> b_52globe___: aiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiiiiiiiiiii habibi
[14:29:59] <muzone> =) =) =)
[14:30:17] <b_52globe___> muzone, homy :D
[14:30:24] <NackNick> O_o
[14:30:29] <muzone> whats going down brotherman?
[14:30:38] <NackNick> calling another man my love, a little homo dont you think?
[14:30:39] <b1lly> lets say i had an element with the text in it "1"           and i wanted to return the value of it and add it to something else
[14:30:53] <b1lly> var = 1 + $('element').text(); returns error
[14:31:04] <coldhead> NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT, NACKNICK
[14:31:06] <b_52globe___> NackNick,  no  it's just 'long time no see' :d
[14:31:12] <NoiseEee> b1lly: var = ?
[14:31:15] <NackNick> yeah yeah yeah
[14:31:22] <NoiseEee> b1lly: also what is 'element' ?
[14:31:26] <NackNick> enjoy the rainbow
[14:32:14] <b1lly> element is a <div>
[14:32:16] <Eviltwin> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/WHxhx/28/
[14:32:23] <b1lly> its like
[14:32:34] <Eviltwin> I'm sorry, I don't really think any more descriptively than that
[14:32:37] <Eviltwin> Hope those help
[14:32:47] <b1lly> <div class="boom">25</div>             var count = $('.boom').text() + 1;
[14:32:51] <b1lly> i want it to return 26
[14:32:56] <Eviltwin> I didn't add comments to the parts that were already your code
[14:33:00] <djMax> sorry - newbie. What does $(this) really do? failing to google properly.
[14:33:03] <NoiseEee> b1lly: other <divs> have that class?
[14:33:04] <Eviltwin> b1lly: parseInt($(".boom").text() + 1)
[14:33:07] <Eviltwin> Err
[14:33:10] <Eviltwin> b1lly: parseInt($(".boom").text()) = 1
[14:33:12] <Eviltwin> ...
[14:33:19] <Eviltwin> You get the gist, you need to use parseInt on the text
[14:33:27] <b1lly> it's returning NAN
[14:33:28] <Eviltwin> djMax: $(...) is the constructor for a jQuery object
[14:33:49] <Eviltwin> If you give it a selector, it builds the object with the elements that match that selector
[14:33:52] <muzone> thats more than enough Eviltwin i love you bro
[14:34:02] <Eviltwin> If you give it an element it builds the object with only that element
[14:34:18] <Eviltwin> elements have properties like parentNode, appendChild, insertBefore, textContent
[14:34:23] <djMax> I'm looking at a sample of somebody providing what they intend to be a "globally used" function and they're doing $(this).MyFn = function (args) {}
[14:34:31] <djMax> not sure what the $(this) is adding to that puzzle
[14:34:32] <Eviltwin> jQuery objects have methods like parent, append, before, and text
[14:34:53] <NackNick> what is a strict statement
[14:34:56] <Eviltwin> If you show more context, that might help
[14:35:08] <Eviltwin> b1lly: Then it's not actually a number
[14:35:32] <Eviltwin> b1lly: see ?eval parseInt("Hello, 1!")
[14:35:33] <bot-t> b1lly: NaN
[14:38:42] <Eviltwin> djMax: They probably meant to do jQuery.fn.MyFn
[14:38:56] <Eviltwin> djMax: Read this page if you have a chance: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[14:39:02] <Eviltwin> It explains how to do that sort of stuff

[15:11:32] <imsky> come on people
[15:17:56] <kevrom> If I bind a function to a form's submit, then later load the form through ajax, is that function bound to the newly arrived form, or should i bind with the success of the load?
[15:18:55] <khmer_> kevrom: instead, you should use delegate, and delegate to the parent of the form
[15:19:21] <kevrom> Interesting, I'll check the docs on delegate, thanks!
[15:39:46] <DukeDrake> can I use regexp in a jqeury selector? like $("#abc.*") ?
[15:40:19] <eddiemonge> why would you want to? you cant use a class or another attribute?
[15:44:25] <DukeDrake> mhm ...
[15:55:44] <iateadonut> does jquery have a native function to convert 1 to 1st, 2 to 2nd, etc?
[15:56:34] <eddiemonge> no

[16:07:47] <gnarf> udp: EyePulp: the attribute selector REQUIRES quotes around value... [name="foo"]
[16:08:02] <DukeDrake> I got a bunch ov values and need to store them so I can quickly slect a relevant key.... any hints?
[16:08:05] <DukeDrake> *of
[16:08:14] <gnarf> DukeDrake: there is no CSS selector that covers that
[16:08:39] <gnarf> DukeDrake: but you could do something like $("input").filter( function() { return this.value == "OMG" } );
[16:09:17] <gnarf> someprimetime: its a temp01 creation
[16:09:43] <DukeDrake> gnarf: good hint! =D
[16:10:01] <DukeDrake> gnarf: I'm pondeirng using .data .... but don't know, how!
[16:10:08] <someprimetime> gnarf: ah nice
[16:10:10] <gnarf> ?.data
[16:10:11] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[16:10:44] <DukeDrake> yes ... but how could I search the values for a needle?
[16:11:08] <gnarf> the same way you'd search any other javascript object?
[16:11:12] <udp> gnarf: you sure?  it's never cared before
[16:11:16] <gnarf> .data() returns the data as an object
[16:11:23] <gnarf> udp: it has cared since 1.4 i believe
[16:11:32] <DukeDrake> gnarf: yes. I don't know how to do that....!
[16:11:37] <gnarf> ?attribute equals selector
[16:11:38] <bot-t> gnarf, Attribute Equals Selector [name="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value exactly equal to a certain value. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[16:12:03] <gnarf> value An attribute value. Quotes are mandatory
[16:12:06] <udp> interesting
[16:12:12] <gnarf> its part of the CSS Spec
[16:12:13] <udp> I guess it supports no quotes for compatibility then
[16:12:15] <gnarf> the quotes are required
[16:12:31] <gnarf> udp: actually, it doesn't - shit has a tendancy to blow up or not work cross browser if you omit them
[16:14:40] <DukeDrake> hmmm
[16:14:52] <snover> without quotes it has to be a valid IDENT
[16:14:56] <snover> if you do not know what an IDENT is, use quotes.
[16:16:32] <eddiemonge> can i still use quotes no matter what?
[16:17:34] <Eviltwin> In what context?
[16:19:46] <eddiemonge> any context. every context. most context
[16:20:12] <Eviltwin> You shouldn't use quotes inside email addresses
[17:11:01] <Tcalp> sort of off-topic question .. (I can't think of a site off the top of my head) .. but you know sites that have that '2.0' feel which contain a illustrated (almost pencil like oulines) of a step-by-step process to illustrate a how-to or to-do ...

[17:38:56] <ldlework> JQuery UI or JQuery Tools?
[17:49:57] <SinnerNyx> this is more of a general javascript question, but that channel appears to be dead about now.
[17:50:06] <SinnerNyx> I'm using chrome for testing.
[17:50:55] <SinnerNyx> Whenever I drag a file from outside of my browser into my browser it appears that 'dragstart' and 'dragend' events are never triggered. how can I detect when the drag action ends?
[17:51:59] <SinnerNyx> the reason I ask is that I making a specific placeholder light up as a visual que for a user to know where he can drop files on the page. however the visual que never disappears presently as I can't figure out how to identify when the drag action has ended/turned into a drop action.
[17:52:17] <SinnerNyx> replace que with cue
[17:54:01] <myndzi> how can i simply copy the values of all input elements that are children of one div to all input elements that are children of another div?
[17:54:11] <myndzi> text contents, checked status, selected item in dropdown, etc.
[17:54:42] <Eviltwin> ?.clone
[17:54:42] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[17:55:35] <myndzi> it's already cloned
[17:55:40] <myndzi> one is blank, the other has data
[17:55:54] <myndzi> i would like to make the blank one have a copy of the data
[17:56:09] <Eviltwin> Why not copy the original?
[17:56:11] <myndzi> presumably delete and recreate would make an undesirable flicker and probably be less efficient than other solutions
[17:56:25] <myndzi> because that's not the point of this function?
[17:56:36] <myndzi> i don't want the data to be copied always
[17:56:39] <myndzi> only when the user requests it
[17:56:48] <myndzi> besides which when the second one is made, the first one is empty
[17:57:11] <myndzi> i've tried looping with .each but don't seem to have stumbled on the proper combination
[17:57:27] <myndzi> also tried extend, directly assigning things, and misc. google results that seemed to possibly apply
[17:57:35] <Eviltwin> The cost of selecting and copying all of those may be more than just copying the whole form
[17:58:07] <myndzi> there's really no way to just loop through the input items and set the values of the other one?
[17:58:38] <Eviltwin> Unless you've already paired them together, they'e need to be selected each time
[17:58:53] <SinnerNyx> i tried hooking into dragenter and dragleave, however for some reason the events are triggered in the following order when dragging an element from element foo to element bar: dragenter foo, dragenter bar, dragleave foo.
[17:58:59] <myndzi> by paired, you mean selecting them in the same statement
[17:59:14] <shesek_> myndzi, you'd really expect that use-case to be supported out of the box by jQuery?
[17:59:34] <mightym> hey guys, I'm using query draggable and wonder if some have experience using a "drag and draw a rectangle selection on all draggables and drag them at once" :)
[17:59:37] <myndzi> how should i know? it seems quite simple and quite along the lines of things jquery already does
[17:59:46] <shesek_> its really not common enough for that... you're gonna have to manually do the "hard" job of selecting both field sets, iterating and matching them to each other
[17:59:47] <myndzi> apparently i know now
[18:00:06] <Eviltwin> Why can't it be cloned?
[18:00:08] <myndzi> i mean, i don't expect it to have a command that's like "do this all"
[18:00:20] <myndzi> but i figured that .each could loop it rather easily, which seems to be incorrect
[18:00:28] <myndzi> since the path to each element is the same from the separate divs
[18:00:38] <myndzi> it should just be something like
[18:00:44] <myndzi> div.input.value = div.input.value, yeah?
[18:00:56] <Eviltwin> Setting a value to itself?
[18:01:01] <shesek_> myndzi, why are you doing that, anyway? it sounds like you're looking for a solution to the wrong problem
[18:01:02] <myndzi> pseudocode :P
[18:01:07] <myndzi> div1.input.value = div2.input.value
[18:01:32] <myndzi> because the form automatically adds a blank item at the bottom when you focus on the last item to make data entry easy
[18:01:51] <shesek_> and you're probably looking for something like `a = $('#a input'); b= $('#b input'); a.each (el, idx) -> b[idx].value = this.value`
[18:01:52] <myndzi> and i want to optionally copy the data down so that certain selections don't need to be re-filled-in
[18:02:06] <Eviltwin> Eww, CoffeeScript
[18:02:19] <shesek_> Eviltwin, yeah, I know...
[18:02:24] <myndzi> ?
[18:02:25] <shesek_> but writing JS just feels weird now :-(
[18:02:33] <shesek_> I'll give him a link to the compiled JS in a sec
[18:02:38] <Eviltwin> ...
[18:02:56] <udp> o_O
[18:03:01] <myndzi> if it requires a dependency, i think i'll pass :)
[18:03:08] <myndzi> but i appreciate the effort
[18:03:21] <myndzi> i suppose i can just delete and clone, but that seems so messy
[18:05:30] <myndzi> ah, you know what occurs to me
[18:05:38] <Eviltwin> More messy than matching up each element?
[18:05:45] <myndzi> i don't need to delete the blank one since there'll always be a trailing copy anyway
[18:06:03] <myndzi> yes, "delete and recreate" seems quite messier than "copy the values"
[18:06:04] <myndzi> :P
[18:06:16] <myndzi> it may not be a jquery task, but this stuff is all already in jquery and i don't understand it as well as i might
[18:07:18] <Eviltwin> Just like "increase funding towards programs showing success in curing disease" sounds messier than "fix the world"
[18:07:30] <shesek__> Sorry, power went down :-(
[18:07:40] <shesek__> myndzi, JavaScript version at http://coffeescript.org/#try:a%20%3D%20%24('%23a%20input')%0Ab%20%3D%20%24('%23b%20input')%0Aa.each%20(el%2C%20idx)%20-%3E%20b%5Bidx%5D.value%20%3D%20this.value
[18:08:10] <Eviltwin> You really saved a lot of time doing that
[18:08:42] <shesek__> Eviltwin, Writing JavaScript just feels wrong now :-\
[18:09:12] <Eviltwin> shesek__: Then you've done something horribly wrong
[18:09:17] <Eviltwin> Get out while you still can
[18:09:21] <Eviltwin> myndzi: http://jsfiddle.net/NNHjc/
[18:09:34] <shesek__> Out of... what?
[18:09:44] <Eviltwin> Out of the CoffeeScript blackhole
[18:10:00] <shesek__> CoffeeScript is the best thing since sliced bread
[18:10:03] <shesek__> Well, other than Coco
[18:10:15] <Eviltwin> Why do you think?
[18:10:20] <Eviltwin> Are you one of those Ruby freaks?
[18:10:29] <shesek__> Nope, no Ruby background
[18:10:45] <shesek__> I do have some Python background, tho
[18:11:33] <shesek__> and... CoffeeScript is just much more elegant than JavaScript
[18:11:44] <Eviltwin> I disagree
[18:12:19] <myndzi> thank you both
[18:13:10] <shesek__> Eviltwin, functions decorators (and higher-order functions in general) are much better looking in CS
[18:13:30] <shesek__> Stuff like http://bit.ly/v6Q36M
[18:13:40] <shesek__> DSLs look much better
[18:13:43] <danzik17> because choosing a language based on how pretty it looks is a winning strategy!
[18:14:49] <shesek__> danzik17, prettiness and elegance has a lot to do with code readability and maintainability
[18:15:45] <danzik17> there's something to be said for coding and debugging in the same language too.  not coding in one, debugging in the other.
[18:15:48] <shesek__> And the ease of creating and applying functions takes off the cognitive load, making you use it more often and makes your code structure much better
[18:15:52] <shesek__> (IMHO)
[18:16:25] <shesek__> danzik17, that's just a technical problem that's about to be soon resolved
[18:16:58] <shesek__> with the soon to be implemented #558 and linemaps (which should land in SpiderMonkey soon)
[18:17:22] <shesek__> !g site:github.com inurl:coffee-script inurl:558
[18:17:47] <shesek__> and besides, its not that much of a problem
[18:18:44] <shesek__> also - being able to play around with your code AST is pretty cool
[18:19:05] <shesek__> Creating macros and extending the syntax to fit your needs
[18:19:12] <shesek__> just implemented that yesterday: http://pastebin.com/ypEZqYUz
[18:21:19] <Ziggy> I'm trying to fix this, when you hover over very quickly, sometimes mouseleaving a list item appears to keep the tip still open -> http://jsfiddle.net/3Wcta/1/
[18:22:52] <udp> Ziggy: if the tip hasn't loaded by the time you move the mouse away, it gets toggled on when the mouse isn't there
[18:23:09] <udp> and then the tip is showing but mouseleave has already triggered
[18:23:24] <Ziggy> udp: alright, so.. any suggestions?
[18:24:33] <donCams> so, google blocks yql? :)
[18:24:48] <udp> perhaps make the tip element permanent (so it's there before it's loaded) and then load the tip into it when needed?
[18:24:54] <shesek> donCams, some of the branded versions of Google doesn't
[18:24:55] <udp> then if it hides again while the tip is loading it doesn't matter
[18:25:00] <shesek> Try ICQ's search
[18:25:12] <shesek> (it does return different and a smaller set of results, tho)
[18:25:21] <Ziggy> udp: ah, I'll try that indeed!
[18:25:43] <shesek> Ziggy, you can mark the element has been toggled away as an .data() on the element
[18:25:49] <shesek> and check that in your AJAX callback
[18:26:06] <Ziggy> shesek: Could you show me an example?
[18:26:35] <shesek> case 'mouseenter': $this.data('tip_visible', true); ...
[18:26:44] <shesek> case 'mouseleave': $this.data('tip_visible', false); ...
[18:26:50] <Ziggy> ah, nice!
[18:27:05] <shesek> complete : function() { if ($elem.data('tip_visible') { ..... } }
[18:27:46] <shesek> hmm, actually, if you already loaded the AJAX request, you might as well add it to the DOM for the next time its needed
[18:27:48] <shesek> but keep it hidden
[18:28:16] <shesek> (i.e. just put `toggleTip($tip)` inside that if)
[18:28:53] <engaged> I have a <form> and have two submit buttons, one is for people to subit a discount code though... onsubmit I have a function that validates input... is tehre a way to not call the onsubmit when someone clicks the "Apply Code" instead of submitting the form?
[18:29:14] <shesek> Ziggy, or, actually - just use a class
[18:29:20] <engaged> ok, if I make the apply code a button that works...
[18:29:30] <shesek> case 'mouseenter': $this.addClass('tip-visible')
[18:29:33] <udp> engaged: return false from the callback, or make Apply Code a normal button instead of a submit button
[18:29:40] <shesek> case 'mouseleave': $this.removeClass('tip-visible')
[18:30:23] <shesek> Than, drop that `toggleTip` completely and just add `.tip {display: none;} .tip-visible .tip { display: block }` to your CSS instead
[18:30:55] <udp> it'd probably look more responsive if the tooltip showed Loading...
[18:31:26] <udp> until the ajax completes and puts the actual content in there
[18:31:29] <Ziggy> udp and shesek: Thanks both.. I'm looking into this now, I'll show you what I'll come up with..
[18:33:36] <shesek> Ziggy, and a tip: next time you're testing something like that on jsfiddle, a small setTimeout is enough to emulate an AJAX request
[18:33:43] <shesek> (usually)
[18:35:17] <whoever_> when i add the script tags for mobile the buton disappears, the tags appear to be correct can someone assist:  http://jsfiddle.net/zHbuC/388/
[18:45:24] <Ziggy> shesek, udp: Alright, I set it up as follows, still it tends to happen -> http://jsfiddle.net/3Wcta/2/
[18:45:51] <Ziggy> am I missing something?
[18:48:21] <udp> Ziggy: http://jsfiddle.net/3Wcta/3/
[18:48:40] <udp> (sorry, I removed your setTimeout, you might want to add that back to test)
[18:49:14] <shesek> $tip.data('tip_visible', 'false');
[18:49:22] <shesek> if ('false') // evaluates to true
[18:49:39] <Ziggy> agh, that was It :P
[18:49:50] <shesek> and you don't really need any of that `data` stuff with the class
[18:49:52] <Ziggy> http://jsfiddle.net/3Wcta/4/ -> seems to work as expected.
[18:50:06] <shesek> nor the `if...else` blocks in the complete
[18:50:29] <shesek> and I meant setTimeout instead the ajax request, you just need to emulate the latency
[18:50:52] <Ziggy> yeah, I got ya, I just guess I was lazy to remove the .ajax
[18:50:54] <Ziggy> ajax*
[18:51:20] <Ziggy> And it was mainly to as well put it up as it will be :>
[18:51:57] <Ziggy> Thanks you both, this really solved it, it seems :)
[18:52:19] <shesek> this should do the trick: http://jsfiddle.net/3Wcta/5/
[18:52:36] <shesek> (without the syntax error I left there)
[18:52:44] <shesek> (oops.. :O)
[18:52:51] <Ziggy> whoopsie, you forgot to close the timeout :P
[18:52:56] <Ziggy> hehe
[18:53:13] <shesek> Well, I have to go
[18:53:22] <shesek> Good luck with that
[18:53:28] <Ziggy> Thanks :-)
[18:53:48] <shesek> blahs, why is it so cold outside?
[18:53:52] <whoever_> this mobile button event isn't firing, can someone assist?  http://jsfiddle.net/mydTu/6/
[18:54:11] <shesek> or, the real question, why am I making plans for 6AM?
[18:54:56] <udp> Ziggy: I would do it like this, then you don't need a class: http://jsfiddle.net/3Wcta/6/
[18:55:14] <udp> (for the record, comparing the html to Loading... like that is horrible btw)
[18:55:35] <SiCKa> http://www.facebook.com/FinancialSTOCK like this page please
[18:55:43] <Ziggy> $tip.data('loaded', false); -> then at loadTip, $tip.data('loaded', true) ?
[18:55:46] <shesek> Ziggy, oh, I think I chopped off a bit too much
[18:55:46] <shesek> my bad
[18:59:59] <sodapop> how can i display the icon for the ui highlight class just like it shows in the theme roller page
[19:00:40] <Ziggy> shesek: http://jsfiddle.net/3Wcta/7/
[19:02:11] <shesek> sodapop, IIRC use .ui-icon-highlight
[19:02:50] <shesek> Ziggy, it has a problem?
[19:03:26] <Ziggy> shesek: nope, finished..
[19:03:33] <shesek> cool :-)
[19:03:42] <shesek> really have to go now, bye
[19:03:52] <Ziggy> cya, thanks for the help again
[19:03:56] <Ziggy> thanks again also udp
[19:05:12] <sodapop> shesek, like addClass('ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all ui-icon-highlight')
[19:22:11] <guy> how to check if to selectors select the same object?
[19:28:39] <j`ey> guy: check the objects they return?
[19:28:52] <guy> I just used DOM comparison.
[19:47:16] <sodapop> when a UI within a dialog is clicked its state remains active until you change focus (only in firefox)
[19:47:31] <sodapop> sorry i mean a UI button
[19:56:50] <arai> Random question:  Working on an HTML5 based project with legacy (ie7/ie8) clients.  Thinking about using jQuery to modify the DOM, replacing <nav> with <div class="nav"> and various other fixes based on UA and version.   Am I doing it wrong?
[19:57:23] <coldhead> arai: have you seen modernizr?
[19:58:14] <arai> Have now, reading....
[20:10:47] <arai> It's sorta working... not exactly what I had in mind though
[20:15:19] <coldhead> oh sure, you may well have different needs
[20:15:34] <coldhead> i just wanted to reduce wheel re-invention
[20:15:37] <coldhead> where possible
[20:16:01] <coldhead> you can also google for html5 shim/shiv to find other options
[20:24:52] <coldhead> so much quit
[20:28:00] <erkan> hi all, anyone family with the tablesorter plugin ?
[20:30:02] <coldhead> familiar, yes, many people here have used it
[20:33:31] <theBrettman> I'm trying to build my own html ide. anyone know the best way I could select an element and return the selected element?
[20:33:49] <erkan> heya coldhead, hopefully its the one from http://tablesorter.com/docs/ and i would like to know what JS code should i use for these http://jsfiddle.net/w4w6m/ hrs, mins, secs sorted properly
[20:35:11] <coldhead> i expect you would have to write a custom sorting function for that erkan
[20:35:58] <erkan> well, i did try something like this example http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-parsers.html
[20:36:09] <erkan> however, im failed after all
[20:36:16] <coldhead> that's the right approach
[20:36:27] <coldhead> can you show us the code you tried?
[20:38:45] <erkan> sure coldhead, http://jsfiddle.net/w4w6m/2/
[20:39:14] <erkan> i did try "text" type
[20:41:27] <coldhead> erkan: you want more than text, you need to convert the string into a number and then sort by that
[20:41:37] <coldhead> here is a function to covert those strings to seconds
[20:41:47] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/w4w6m/3/
[20:41:52] <whoever_> i have jquery mobile framework and jqyery 1.7 but does jfiddle have something that i am missing other than those two files as this does not work for me on my  page  http://jsfiddle.net/phillpafford/wvVmT/2/   can someone assist ?
[20:42:53] <coldhead> you can add resources in the left hand side, whoever_
[20:42:58] <theBrettman> you could try jsbin.com instead of jsfiddle...
[20:43:25] <erkan> coldhead, sorry why converting ? i just want them listed properly
[20:44:12] <whoever_> coldhead: but the only two reascourses i see it using is jqm and jq . correct or is there somethin' im missing
[20:44:18] <coldhead> don't you want to sort by them, erkan ?
[20:44:50] <erkan> no, i want the whole data is sorted, first by hours if they equal then mins, and in same case then use secs
[20:45:08] <coldhead> whoever_: i don't know, man, i'd just try starting with the Vanilla NoJS and then add whatever you specifically require until it works
[20:46:14] <coldhead> erkan: tablesorter doesn't know about hours and so on. the idea is you provide it a function (like the one i wrote you) that will turn the string into a nice consistent number (the number of seconds equal to the time in the table) and then tablesorter can sort from that
[20:46:39] <coldhead> the user will never see the conversion
[20:46:42] <coldhead> it will "just work"
[20:47:09] <theBrettman> I suggest you store the date like the computer does and parse it in the output
[20:47:40] <theBrettman> are you getting the data from a database?
[20:47:41] <coldhead> i suggest you do whatever theBrettman says, erkan
[20:47:45] <erkan> its able to sort dates like "Dec 10, 2002 5:14 AM" so also able to sort "good/bad/med" i kinda thought it would be able to sort the content i have
[20:48:20] <coldhead> it CAN sort that
[20:48:38] <coldhead> the example you linked converts good/bad/med into numbers
[20:48:40] <coldhead> and sorts them
[20:48:50] <coldhead> you are converting the time in hrs mins secs to numbes
[20:48:53] <coldhead> numbers*
[20:48:55] <coldhead> and sorting that
[20:48:58] <coldhead> it's exactly the same
[20:49:02] <whoever_> coldhead: ok
[20:49:07] <coldhead> the function is just different
[20:54:13] <coldhead> don't make me go upside your head
[20:55:44] <theBrettman> ui channel is ded :/
[20:57:32] <abjorn> ur ded
[20:58:46] <coldhead> i though this was the UI channel now
[20:58:56] <coldhead> i got in trouble for sending people there
[20:59:05] <coldhead> so now i have to hear all their stupid little problems here
[20:59:19] <tga> hey, anyone around using jsTree?
[20:59:28] * tga can't figure out how to expand the whole thing on load
[20:59:45] <arai> Random question:  Working on an HTML5 based project with legacy (ie7/ie8) clients.  Thinking about using jQuery to modify the DOM, replacing <nav> with <div class="nav"> and various other fixes based on UA and version.   Am I doing it wrong?  Modernizr isn't working right out of the box, and I figure whats the harm in using this as an excuse to get to know jQuery better.
[21:00:55] <coldhead> arai: have you considered how you'll modify the css on IE?
[21:01:05] <coldhead> to turn nav {} to div.nav {} ?
[21:01:22] <coldhead> that scares me off doing it myself :)
[21:01:27] <arai> coldhead: append a link to an additional css file if the browser version falls within a certain range
[21:01:41] <theBrettman> jquery would be a fun way to do it
[21:01:44] <abjorn> ajpiano your blog seems to have an inordinate amount of first grader drawings
[21:01:47] <coldhead> and have the author write multiple CSS files?
[21:01:54] <abjorn> or not enough, i can't tell
[21:01:57] <coldhead> abjorn: you say that like it's a bad thing
[21:02:11] <theBrettman> setting it to class instead of id is a good idea
[21:02:42] <erkan> coldhead, probably im doing something wrong http://jsfiddle.net/w4w6m/5/
[21:02:52] <theBrettman> iss addClass UI?
[21:03:01] <theBrettman> oh wait, that's not for that, lol
[21:03:14] <theBrettman> or wait, yeah it is
[21:03:21] <coldhead> erkan: you want to use the same kind of code they have in the exampe but replace their format: function with the new one
[21:03:31] <coldhead> fuck i'll even paste it for you
[21:04:16] <Ziggy> theBrettman: addClass does not depend on jquery ui.
[21:05:11] <theBrettman> so does anyone know the smartest way to return the element I clicked on?
[21:05:22] <coldhead> erkan: http://jsfiddle.net/w4w6m/6/
[21:05:32] <coldhead> you still need to change the ID i think
[21:05:34] <Ziggy> theBrettman: What do you need, the whole element, or an id, or what?
[21:05:39] <coldhead> but that's how you include the function
[21:05:47] <theBrettman> I have a feeling there's an easier way to do it with ui. maybe ui mouse or something
[21:06:44] <Ziggy> theBrettman: I'm not following what you're trying to do.
[21:07:08] <Ziggy> theBrettman: You're not being clear.
[21:07:41] <theBrettman> I want to select elements so I can do things like append stuff to them
[21:07:54] <theBrettman> I see selectable but not sure that's what I want
[21:08:07] <theBrettman> I think there's an easy way I found before but I forget
[21:08:15] <Ziggy> theBrettman: That's simple
[21:08:29] <coldhead> erkan: that's basically everything you'll need: http://jsfiddle.net/w4w6m/7/
[21:08:33] <theBrettman> I thought so but I'm forever noob
[21:08:43] <Ziggy> theBrettman: http://jsfiddle.net/gjQVU/
[21:08:48] <Ziggy> theBrettman: Try clicking foo..
[21:09:38] <theBrettman> not exactly
[21:09:47] <theBrettman> that's when u click on a particular item
[21:10:03] <theBrettman> I just want to return what element I clicked on
[21:10:19] <theBrettman> I'll assign it to selectedElement
[21:10:32] <Ziggy> theBrettman: That's exactly what's happening in that fiddle.
[21:10:44] <Ziggy> theBrettman: $(this); is the element that was clicked on.
[21:11:08] <erkan> i see ermm "newbie to jquery" sorry coldhead, it works fine for the content i had, but just tested for a different data that had no hrs but had min, sec with the rest this case it fails and table is no longer sortable
[21:11:14] <theBrettman> what's .live? I forget
[21:11:48] <theBrettman> nvm, I'll look it up, lol
[21:11:50] <coldhead> okay, erkan
[21:11:59] <coldhead> i'll make it handle that more safely for you
[21:12:02] <Ziggy> theBrettman: .live or .delegate is used when the item that was clicked is dynamically added to the dom.
[21:13:11] <Ziggy> s/is/was
[21:13:42] <theBrettman> might be even cooler if I can return the document index of the element I click on
[21:14:54] <theBrettman> oh, I can! figured it out
[21:15:16] <Ziggy> theBrettman: http://jsfiddle.net/gjQVU/1/
[21:15:17] <theBrettman> guess I'll just use click() with index()
[21:15:50] <theBrettman> exactly ziggy, lol
[21:15:54] <coldhead> erkan: http://jsfiddle.net/w4w6m/8/
[21:16:10] <coldhead> erkan: make sense? it tests for each component separately now
[21:16:14] <theBrettman> I need a chip for my brain to make it work right
[21:16:16] <coldhead> so it's okay if they're missing
[21:16:27] <coldhead> lol theBrettman
[21:17:13] <Ziggy> theBrettman: I think you're just forgetting to use google or jquery.com before asking a question.
[21:17:30] <Ziggy> theBrettman: Should be a rule of thumb.
[21:17:31] <djQuery> instead of using live here is an exmple that uses on http://jsfiddle.net/gjQVU/2/
[21:17:58] <Ziggy> djQuery: That's the same as using .delegate
[21:18:10] <djQuery> ziggy basicaly
[21:18:36] <theBrettman> what's an SCSS?
[21:19:05] <Ziggy> css extension
[21:19:12] <Ziggy> afaik
[21:19:13] <theBrettman> I searched like a million different things trying to find it, lol
[21:19:27] <theBrettman> I kept getting how to do things with the select element
[21:19:56] <erkan> has to be something wrong coldhead, no longer sortable
[21:20:06] <coldhead> welcome to debugging, erkan :)
[21:20:10] <djQuery> theBrettman: search for saas
[21:20:26] <erkan> im always a good tester :P
[21:20:46] <Ziggy> erkan: Do you have a fiddle for what you're trying to achieve? :P
[21:21:21] <djQuery> theBrettman: http://sass-lang.com/
[21:21:24] <Cork> Ziggy, theBrettman: no scss is a css compiler
[21:21:32] <erkan> Ziggy http://jsfiddle.net/w4w6m/8/ < last update by coldhead
[21:21:39] <Cork> your write in a css like language, then compile it to compact css
[21:21:55] <coldhead> sorry erkan, some idiot had a , where they wanted a .
[21:22:28] <theBrettman> As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method.
[21:22:29] <Cork> Ziggy, theBrettman: its like coffie but for css
[21:22:42] <coldhead> erkan: http://jsfiddle.net/w4w6m/11/
[21:22:42] <Ziggy> cork: oh alright :P
[21:22:50] <coldhead> that's without the bug >: |
[21:23:22] <theBrettman> sweet, I like it
[21:23:52] <coldhead> hooray!
[21:23:55] <theBrettman> is there a way to change stuff in the css doc with jquery instead of inline in the html doc?
[21:24:09] <coldhead> i've never found a way, theBrettman
[21:24:10] <Ziggy> theBrettman: .on wasn't added 'till 1.7 :p
[21:24:14] <Cork> theBrettman: yes you can
[21:24:22] <coldhead> do tell, corksy
[21:24:26] <Cork> theBrettman: but you would have to work on the stylesheets object
[21:24:35] <Cork> window.stylesheets
[21:24:46] <theBrettman> sweet! perfect!
[21:24:58] <Cork> its not really jquery though
[21:25:10] <Cork> its just pure javascript
[21:25:49] <coldhead> cssQuery, Cork? do it for the team
[21:26:06] <Cork> heh
[21:26:22] <theBrettman> I know some game developers that would worship you
[21:26:54] <theBrettman> if only the browsers would get with it and get all that css3 animation and 3d stuff working
[21:26:59] <Cork> it would prov not even be that hard :)
[21:27:28] <theBrettman> css kinda looks like json already anyway
[21:27:35] <Cork> oh, btw its document.styleSheets, not window.styleSheets
[21:27:51] <coldhead> THANKS FOR NOTHING CORK
[21:27:59] <coldhead> MY ENTIRE SITE IS RUINED NOW
[21:28:02] <theBrettman> I'll bet that's how dreamweaver does it
[21:28:06] <Cork> lol
[21:28:28] <theBrettman> I wanna make a gui like they do for adding classes
[21:28:41] <Cork> theBrettman: if you exclude ie, and in some cases opera, all browsers do
[21:28:43] <coldhead> sadly document.styleSheets = [] does not unstyle my page
[21:28:55] <theBrettman> well, there's new stuff not even webkit supports
[21:29:11] <theBrettman> rofl @ coldhead
[21:29:27] <erkan> looks great coldhead, i did try add days ie, what i put is var days = str.match(/(\d+)days/); and  if (hours) time += parseInt(days[1]) * 60 * 60 * 24;
[21:29:34] <erkan> does that sound like fail ? coz it did
[21:29:55] <theBrettman> there's already stuff for parsing time, erkan
[21:30:11] <theBrettman> but I think you're doing it backwards depending on where you're getting your data from
[21:30:35] <Cork> coldhead: the interface isn't really an array
[21:30:49] <Cork> coldhead: its a stylesheetlist
[21:31:38] <Cork> you can do for(var i=0; document.styleSheets.length); i++) { document.styleSheets[i].disabled = true }
[21:31:43] <Cork> + though
[21:32:11] <theBrettman> http://www.javascriptkit.com/domref/stylesheet.shtml
[21:32:33] <coldhead> erkan: if (days)
[21:32:36] <coldhead> not if (hours)
[21:32:43] <theBrettman> I like the rules[]
[21:32:44] <erkan> yuck!
[21:33:02] <erkan> how the hell i did not notice it :x lol
[21:33:17] <Cork> theBrettman: "IE only object" <_<
[21:35:07] <Ziggy> time for bed
[21:35:13] <Ziggy> goodnight
[21:35:20] <theBrettman> gn, and thx ziggy
[21:35:44] <Ziggy> np =)
[21:36:04] <theBrettman> I might live in this chatroom, lol
[21:36:12] <coldhead> you're very welcome, theBrettman
[21:36:29] <coldhead> you too, erkan, you'd better stick around and help some kids out as penance for making me write all your code
[21:36:49] <theBrettman> lol
[21:37:07] <theBrettman> ok so I think I like css better than scss and sass
[21:37:16] <coldhead> heresy
[21:37:27] <theBrettman> is it just me or does css look exactly like json already?
[21:37:34] <theBrettman> well, not quite but...
[21:37:55] <coldhead> they've both inherited {curly braces} from C
[21:38:08] <theBrettman> well the hash values too
[21:38:14] <erkan> im sorry coldhead, will try learn first before help :x thanks a lot! best wishes at new year btw
[21:38:18] <naeluh> hello I need some help figuring why my jquery slide up slide down script is not working its at http://onela-iaf.org/onela_new/sites/all/themes/fusion/fusion_core/js/hover_title.js?lxnkl1

[21:38:29] <naeluh> not sure why its not working
[21:38:37] <naeluh> it does have an error
[21:38:37] <theBrettman> key:value
[21:39:16] <naeluh> does anyone know why it would not be working?
[21:39:20] <coldhead> erkan: thank you, and i'm serious, stick around and learn more and help out
[21:39:29] <theBrettman> anyone heard of fastFrag?
[21:39:55] <erkan> alright coldhead, added to autojoin! (;
[21:39:55] <naeluh> http://onela-iaf.org/onela_new/news its supposed to be utilized on this page
[21:40:09] <Cork> naeluh: and you get no error?
[21:40:30] <Cork> naeluh: is the each loop executed when you call showFeatureText() ?
[21:40:31] <theBrettman> I wonder if anyone made a page called nothing but jquery?
[21:40:32] <naeluh> Cork: thanks yeah there is an error
[21:40:35] * TofuTurkey nick cgiGeek
[21:40:37] <coldhead> good work, erkan, this IS a very nice channel
[21:40:41] <Cork> that is ex. put a console.log in there
[21:40:49] <TofuTurkey> .
[21:40:50] <naeluh> me?
[21:40:54] <Cork> yes
[21:41:00] <Cork> but first whats the error?
[21:41:58] <cgiGeek1> .
[21:42:04] <naeluh> Cork: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fn' of undefined
[21:42:04] <naeluh> (anonymous function)
[21:42:07] <coldhead> sup cgiGeek1
[21:42:34] <cgiGeek1> sorry have a really long page, how can I set focus to a diff id after a .post ?
[21:42:38] <naeluh> Cork does that make sense
[21:42:42] <cgiGeek1> hi there coldhead
[21:42:43] <Cork> naeluh: have you wrapped your plugin code in (function($){})(jQuery); ?
[21:43:28] <coldhead> cgiGeek1: $('#different_id').get(0).focus()
[21:43:37] <Cork> naeluh: and is jquery loaded before you extend $.fn?
[21:43:45] <cgiGeek1> amazing, thanks ColdHead
[21:44:11] <coldhead> cgiGeek1: for bonus marks, find out why the get() is necessary
[21:44:34] <cgiGeek1> will do
[21:44:40] <naeluh> Cork when you say loaded before you mean the jquery is first in order of js files loaded
[21:44:45] <naeluh> corect?
[21:44:52] <coldhead> surrrre you will
[21:45:02] <Cork> naeluh: exactly
[21:45:12] <Cork> and they need to both be in the head
[21:45:26] <cgiGeek1> I considered it, and is the right thing to do, even at 1AM,the more I understand the faster I will code.
[21:45:35] <cgiGeek1> it was not my first choice tho :)
[21:46:07] <coldhead> pfft, 1am
[21:46:48] <cgiGeek1> i start coding when wife sleeps
[21:46:56] <cgiGeek1> so I have 2 lifes
[21:46:59] <naeluh> Cork: no its not  loaded first my js file comes first and here is the script http://pastebin.com/a7h7NAFr it doesnt have any (function($){})(jQuery); in it
[21:47:02] <cgiGeek1> none are very rewarding, lol
[21:47:50] <theBrettman> how does a stylesheet have a title?
[21:47:50] <Cork> naeluh: then move them
[21:48:03] <Cork> naeluh: you can't extend jquery before its loaded
[21:48:18] <coldhead> it is ever thus, cgiGeek1
[21:48:24] <naeluh> Cork okay I will try that
[21:48:33] <cgiGeek1> :D
[21:48:36] <naeluh> Cork I was trying to used this http://paulsturgess.co.uk/articles/83-jquery-text-slide-up-slide-down-effect

[21:54:22] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[21:54:31] <AfroTurf> is there an event like .resize that will work on an element to trigger when the height changes?
[21:54:58] <coldhead> ?g ben alman resize plugin @ AfroTurf

[21:55:16] <AfroTurf> cool!
[21:55:19] <AfroTurf> thanks!!
[21:55:41] <Cork> naeluh: hmm... that looks like it should work...
[21:55:48] <CatBoy119> I have a long string: var plot = '["x",y],["x2",y2], ["x3",y3]' etc   I'm trying to use this string in jqPlot.. which goes like $.jqplot('chart1',  [[ plot ]],{ at the start.. this fails. However, if I remove the var plot out of $.jqplot('chart1',  [[ plot ]],{... copy the string from a debug output echoed to a div in the site.. and paste that output into where plot was (so it's like $.jqplot('chart1',  [[ pasted_debug_output_here 
[21:55:57] <CatBoy119> Everything else works except for this specific thing. >.<
[21:56:15] <Cork> naeluh: the only thing i'm a bit worrid about is line 36
[21:56:27] <Cork> naeluh: that script is loaded async
[21:56:38] <Cork> after all the other scripts is loaded
[21:56:47] <Cork> s/is/are/
[21:57:04] <naeluh> Cork: how should it be
[21:57:33] <Cork> naeluh: a normal script tag, preferably
[21:57:44] <Cork> though it might not be a problem
[21:57:55] <Cork> depends on what it actaully does to jquery
[21:58:40] <naeluh> do I need to add a plugin for slide up and slide down to work
[21:58:55] <Cork> no
[21:59:10] <Cork> that plugin is just a shorthand
[21:59:58] <naeluh> let me try something I am going to try and load the js a different way
[22:00:29] <Cork> $(select).bind('mouseenter mouseleave', function() { $(this).slideToggle('slow') });
[22:00:34] <Cork> should prob do what you want
[22:01:22] <Cork> naeluh: btw a side note
[22:01:31] <naeluh> Cork yeah
[22:01:38] <Cork> naeluh: thoug css @imports WILL kill your loading speed
[22:01:51] <Cork> so you don't want to use that live
[22:02:25] <naeluh> cool I will that script you wrote would that work?
[22:02:41] <naeluh> Cork how would I call it with a div
[22:03:00] <Cork> $('div').bind('mouseenter mouseleave', function() { $(this).slideToggle('slow') });
[22:03:05] <Cork> or the .classname or #id
[22:03:24] <naeluh> Cork cool I am going to try it your awesome
[22:03:33] <naeluh> Be back in a sec
[22:06:13] <Cork> lol "thoug" didn't even catch that one XD
[22:06:21] <Cork> those
[22:06:22] <makeshiftwings> Hello all. Looking for a little help here. I have the following issue: I have a <div> with a <ul> list inside of it. The divs are being positioned absolutely by a jquery plugin called "Masonry". My problem is, the div height isn't specified because it should adjust to the height of the list inside. It's not though, and when they're absolutely positioned, the stack on each other instead of...
[22:06:23] <makeshiftwings> ...being spaced. Hard to explain. See example here: http://www.vikingsterritory.com/twittergrid/index.html
[22:06:27] <makeshiftwings> Thanks for any help!
[22:09:25] <Cork> makeshiftwings: only guessing but you prob need to delay the posisoning of the elements until the ajax has loaded
[22:09:38] <Cork> i can't even find where you do it so :)
[22:09:50] <makeshiftwings> do you know how to do that?
[22:10:04] <makeshiftwings> basically, i think i need to figure out how to make the div height adjust to the height of its child list
[22:10:29] <Cork> makeshiftwings: it is adjusting
[22:10:37] <CatBoy119> I've identified my issue to be conversion problems.. This line is treated all as string: [x,y],[x,y] including the comma in between and the brackets too. Is there a way for me to convert the brackets and commas to non-string?
[22:10:57] <Cork> but before they'r positioned, they have to be filled with there content
[22:11:04] <Cork> as they'r positioned absolute
[22:11:04] <CatBoy119> >.< Idk, can they even be stored in a variable as nonstring. :/
[22:11:24] <Cork> makeshiftwings: and that brings the second question, why are you positioning them absolutly?
[22:11:37] <Cork> makeshiftwings: isn't something like float: left; better?
[22:11:43] <makeshiftwings> they are being positioned absolutely by the jquery plugin "Masonry"
[22:11:49] <makeshiftwings> it is supposed to create a stacked grid effet
[22:11:52] <makeshiftwings> effect*
[22:11:57] <Cork> ah
[22:12:13] <makeshiftwings> It's not working though because the elements haven't been prescribed a height... I think. So it doesn't know where to absolutely position them vertically
[22:12:14] <Cork> then you need to dealy the init of that plugin until you've loaded the content
[22:12:32] <makeshiftwings> Can I do that by moving the scripts to the footer?
[22:12:35] <Cork> ya, as the elements content, isn't set when it run
[22:12:39] <Cork> no
[22:12:58] <makeshiftwings> how would you do it then?
[22:13:08] <Cork> you do run something like $().masonry() right?
[22:13:53] <makeshiftwings> $(function(){
[22:13:55] <makeshiftwings>   $('#container').masonry({
[22:13:57] <makeshiftwings>     // options
[22:13:58] <makeshiftwings>   }
[22:14:00] <makeshiftwings>   });
[22:14:01] <makeshiftwings> });
[22:14:03] <makeshiftwings> oops, sorry. *new to irc*
[22:14:16] <Cork> ya, a simple "yes" would have been enough
[22:14:26] <makeshiftwings> "yes" (again, sorry)
[22:14:35] <Cork> that call has to happen in a callback from the twitter call
[22:14:49] <Cork> else the divs won't have the content so the div's height will be wrong
[22:15:19] <makeshiftwings> can you point me in the right direction on how to achieve that. i've worked with jquery before but not too experienced
[22:15:39] <Cork> most likly no
[22:15:56] <Cork> its a bit to muck to plow through to find where you actually get the twitter data from >_>
[22:16:10] <Cork> *much
[22:16:42] <makeshiftwings> it's being retrieved using json and the twitter api. it was made by "seaofclouds" and called Tweet!
[22:18:27] <Cork> makeshiftwings: skimming through the plugin, it looks like it triggers a "loaded" event on the element you bind it to
[22:18:32] <erkan> how can i use an id for different headers ?
[22:18:59] <theBrettman> damn. on() took over bind() too!
[22:19:06] <Cork> makeshiftwings: so you would have to bind it on each element, and count till that all of them are loaded
[22:19:33] <Cork> makeshiftwings: then call masonry
[22:19:39] <theBrettman> and live() lol
[22:19:54] <Cork> theBrettman: on does all event bindings
[22:20:02] <theBrettman> oh, and one() looks cool!
[22:20:15] <makeshiftwings> *sigh* think this one is out of my league
[22:20:41] <Cork> theBrettman: though it didn't "take over" it just represents another way to do it
[22:21:01] <makeshiftwings> is there an inline element I could put them in that would work instead of a <div>?
[22:21:04] <theBrettman> well, it's the preferred way, lol
[22:21:28] <Cork> makeshiftwings: the problem isn't with the element, its that its absolutly positioned
[22:21:38] <Cork> makeshiftwings: that takes them out of the textflow
[22:21:58] <Cork> so they have to know there heights when they'r positioned, else they overlap
[22:22:01] <theBrettman> I'm trying to make an ide with jquery/jquery-ui
[22:22:11] <Cork> and to know that, they have to get there content first
[22:22:17] <makeshiftwings> right, i'm following you
[22:22:23] <theBrettman> I'll need a way to bind the properties panel to the selected object
[22:22:32] <theBrettman> and vice versa
[22:22:41] <theBrettman> any tips?
[22:22:53] <Cork> bind it?
[22:23:03] <Cork> you mean keep a reference to them?
[22:23:08] <makeshiftwings> do you freelance? would you be willing to work on it for pay? how long do you think it would take to make the modifications?
[22:23:15] <Cork> so they know what they relate to?
[22:23:31] <Cork> makeshiftwings: no i work for a company, and i have more then enough to do
[22:23:43] <theBrettman> yeah, if I resizer the object, I want it to reflect in the properties panel or if I change the properties in the panel, it should reflect on the object. would I have to do two statements or could i do both with one?
[22:23:53] <Cork> (two three ppls job actually...)
[22:23:54] <makeshiftwings> alright, well thanks anyway. wish i could get this figured out myself, but doesn't look like i have the jquery knowledge necessary
[22:24:44] <Cork> theBrettman: well you could store a reference in ex. data-ref, and then use that to trigger updates
[22:25:03] <Cork> theBrettman: but ya, you need to bind them separatly and propagate the information yourself
[22:25:26] <erlnoob> I'm using jquery-ui's sortable, and there's some jerkiness with firefox (v9.0.1) when I drag an <li>, some of the elements beneath it jiggles
[22:25:29] <theBrettman> I'm surprised I can't find any examples
[22:25:30] <makeshiftwings> thanks for your help cork. very appreciated
[22:25:37] <Cork> makeshiftwings: np
[22:26:03] <erlnoob> anybody can explain to me why and how to fix this? someone must have had gone through this..
[22:26:44] <erlnoob> by jiggle I meant it moves a few pixels down temporarily
[22:26:48] <Cork> erlnoob: was some times since i fiddled with it, but it might be a border or margin causing it
[22:27:18] <Cork> erlnoob: i had things like that back then, but this was in jquery 1.3.6 so it wasn't exactly yesterday
[22:27:53] <erlnoob> forgot to tell, I'm using latest stable jquery and jquery-ui
[22:30:04] <erkan> http://jsfiddle.net/w4w6m/12/ < that didnt work, need use same id for different headers, what way should i do ?
[22:30:19] <theBrettman> undo is gonna be fun
[22:30:52] <theBrettman> maybe I'll make an advanced undo redo...
[22:31:21] <theBrettman> where you can undo individual things and redo things without redoing everything
[22:31:45] <theBrettman> kinda like how a macro works...
[22:36:05] <naeluh> Cork still not working
[22:36:22] <naeluh> Cork: still not working
[22:37:30] <Cork> naeluh: can't really help you without seeing the page
[22:37:36] <Cork> that should work
[22:38:41] <naeluh> Cork: This is the page http://onela-iaf.org/onela_new/news
[22:39:12] <naeluh> Cork: I d really appreciate if you could take a quick look
[22:40:28] <Cork> naeluh: and where's the code?
[22:41:30] <naeluh> http://onela-iaf.org/onela_new/sites/all/themes/fusion/fusion_core/js/hover_title.js?lxnkl1
[22:45:29] <Cork> naeluh: try this one http://pastebin.com/0Fy42SUe
[22:46:18] <naeluh> cool just replace the code
[22:46:30] <naeluh> Cork:thanks
[22:46:58] <Cork> np
[22:47:33] <naeluh> Cork how did you do that
[22:47:40] <naeluh> it works
[22:47:41] <Cork> do what?
[22:47:44] <Cork> lol
[22:47:58] <Cork> check the changes agenst your code
[22:48:18] <Cork> you used a scoping function instead of a jquery ready call
[22:48:34] <naeluh> I will what tool do you use fix that
[22:48:50] <Cork> uh... editing?
[22:48:53] <erlnoob> I think I know the solution: specify the <li>'s height and firefox will behave
[22:49:05] <naeluh> yeah
[22:49:20] <naeluh> or did you just see that it was wrong
[22:49:25] <Cork> ya
[22:49:34] <naeluh> oh
[22:49:37] <naeluh> weird
[22:49:48] <Cork> naeluh: 1. the showFeatureTest() needs to be run when the dom is done loading
[22:50:03] <Cork> that needs the ready call $(function() {});
[22:50:23] <Cork> and i moved the declaration above the call to setFeatureText()
[22:50:27] <Cork> thats all i did
[22:50:44] <naeluh> Cork: Cool I really learn this stuff better your great
[22:53:39] <coldhead> ?nopm @ erkan
[22:53:40] <bot-t> erkan, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[22:53:42] <coldhead> :P
[22:53:49] <theBrettman> sound like a good idea?
[22:54:27] <theBrettman> I was thinking about putting it in document data but then realized, if you did a lot, that would be too hard to find anything
[22:55:25] <theBrettman> but if it was on each object... that would be sorted a lil
[22:57:28] <theBrettman> oh, that would be awesome cuz I could have it on the form elements in the properties panel too and each form element would have history!
[22:58:01] <theBrettman> like if u changed the width of something, u could see a history of widths
[22:58:36] <theBrettman> this could change the way ppl develop with an ide! lol
[23:01:28] <efazati> pushstate vs hash mark | which one is better?
[23:02:26] <Cork> depends
[23:02:30] <Cork> pushState is nicer
[23:02:35] <Cork> hash is crossbrowser
[23:02:56] <Cork> so you prob need hash as a fallback what ever you do
[23:03:42] <theBrettman> hashbangs for breakfast
[23:11:25] <theBrettman> I thought pushState() worked in all browsers?
[23:12:35] <Cork> ie doens't support history
[23:12:54] <Cork> or rather it doesn't support any of the html5 history extensions
[23:13:01] <theBrettman> oh
[23:13:04] <theBrettman> figures
[23:13:09] <Cork> ya...
[23:13:20] <theBrettman> I say everyone should just not support ie, lol
[23:13:50] <theBrettman> if all web developers would just redirect everyone to where they can get another browser, lol
[23:14:22] <Cork> :)
[23:14:33] <theBrettman>  maybe even be so rude as to use an actual redirect if ie
[23:14:39] <Cork> you'r welcome to create a page for that :)
[23:14:54] <theBrettman> yeah, the only page on the web that ie will work on, lol
[23:15:19] <theBrettman> if you're on this page, it's cuz no one likes ie...
[23:15:40] <Cork> a part about html5 that many don't talk about is that much of html5 reverts standard implementations to "what ie does"
[23:16:15] <atxq> I am trying to detect when the content of an iframe changes. how can i do this?
[23:16:25] <mindis|work> indeed. it should be more like XHTML strict :/
[23:16:32] <Cork> atxq: you can bind .load on the element
[23:16:51] <Cork> mindis|work: so use xhtml5
[23:16:57] <atxq> $("iframe").load(){});
[23:17:08] <Cork> mindis|work: oh, btw you will only support ie9+ and other browsers
[23:17:10] <Cork> :)
[23:17:17] <mindis|work> Cork well right now i don't think it's smart to use any HTML5 right now
[23:17:23] <theBrettman> $(iframe).on("change"
[23:17:51] <Cork> mindis|work: html5 is mainly just rules to make the error correction work the same in all browsers
[23:17:59] <Cork> mindis|work: so html5 is fine to use
[23:18:00] <atxq> thanks, let me try it here
[23:18:30] <Aravindnaidu> Hi guys
[23:18:32] <Cork> if you want to use the new semantic like section and article, you need a few line of css for newer ie, and 4 lines of js for older ones
[23:18:39] <Cork> so its safe enough to use
[23:18:53] <Cork> canvas and video/audio need a plugin fallback
[23:19:04] <Cork> but... it needs that anyway, so its cool
[23:19:18] <theBrettman> I say developers get a  standard by making users change their browser, lol
[23:19:26] <mindis|work> though honestly i think the whole html+css+js system needs to go :P
[23:19:39] <Cork> mindis|work: uh... inplace of what?
[23:19:47] <Cork> binary blobs?
[23:19:55] <Aravindnaidu> is there any event just like click, mouseover etc to trigger an event when a child is deleted?
[23:19:57] <theBrettman> I'm for the binary blobs, lol
[23:20:04] <Cork> i'm not
[23:20:06] <theBrettman> I say replace it all with jquery!
[23:20:13] <mindis|work> dunno. but it's so rotten and illogical to the core there's no saving it anymore
[23:20:19] <Cork> theBrettman: then your back with "your os isn't supported" or "your arch isn't supported"
[23:20:34] <Cork> mindis|work: it is?
[23:20:34] <mindis|work> i think some kind of python apps might work
[23:20:46] <Cork> i find all of it works quite well actually
[23:20:46] <theBrettman> ha ha
[23:20:58] <Aravindnaidu> i want something like $("parent").childDeleted(function(){});
[23:21:12] <Aravindnaidu> is there any such event in jquery?
[23:21:13] <theBrettman> but you don't have to buy a new computer, just download a real browser, lol
[23:21:16] <mindis|work> Cork well look at the file input element and how it works. it's a disaster
[23:21:32] <Cork> Aravindnaidu: there is dommodified, but its not crossbrowser
[23:21:54] <Cork> mindis|work: thats mainly cause its riddled with security problems
[23:21:54] <theBrettman> which scripting language is closest to C?
[23:22:12] <theBrettman> you can replace html with javascript
[23:22:13] <Cork> theBrettman: javascript is actually quite close to c
[23:22:21] <Cork> you can even compile c into javascript
[23:22:26] <theBrettman> honestly, u can replace css with javascript too
[23:22:30] <mindis|work> the whole 'web2.0' we're all so fond of is just a desperate attempt to go around the old problems with hacks instead of solving them
[23:22:32] <Aravindnaidu> so there is no way to track such actions?
[23:22:38] <Cork> theBrettman: that would be damn impractial if you just want to publicate a document
[23:22:52] <theBrettman> not if it has a gui
[23:22:56] <Cork> Aravindnaidu: you do that by tracking when you do it
[23:23:07] <Cork> theBrettman: the thing, web isn't
[23:23:36] <theBrettman> well if the ide made sites that are just gui's...
[23:24:09] <Cork> but forming blogs and things like that in an gui format makes it harder then it needs to be
[23:24:15] <theBrettman> I wonder why jquery-ui made it widget instead of class?
[23:24:35] <Cork> what the web needs is the fixed form css rules thats in the making
[23:24:53] <theBrettman> link to what ur talking about?
[23:24:55] <mindis|work> that would help...a little
[23:24:56] <Cork> theBrettman: made what widget?
[23:25:35] <theBrettman> $.widget
[23:25:39] <theBrettman> oops
[23:25:44] <theBrettman> I mean widget()
[23:26:17] <theBrettman> that's pretty much what jquery-ui is all about
[23:26:23] <theBrettman> for classes
[23:26:27] <Cork> theBrettman: ex http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/
[23:26:46] <Cork> there is like 4-5 alternatives for standardisation
[23:26:48] <mindis|work> grrrr. inserting text at caret requires a ridiculous amount of code
[23:26:50] <Cork> webkit has one
[23:26:52] <Cork> mozilla has one
[23:26:55] <Cork> and ie has one
[23:27:08] <Cork> and theres a few more, that i don't think anyone has implemented yet
[23:27:35] <theBrettman> oh, I see. that's part of css3
[23:27:47] <Cork> no its not
[23:27:55] <Cork> its part of working draft
[23:27:58] <Cork> its not a standard yet
[23:28:16] <theBrettman> it's not part of the whole box thing?
[23:28:23] <Cork> its might even be dropped for one of the other implementations
[23:28:35] <Cork> theBrettman: "whole box" ?
[23:28:38] <theBrettman> like box-flex
[23:28:41] <theBrettman> it's css3
[23:29:04] <Cork> flexbox isn't released yet
[23:29:07] <theBrettman> there's box-align
[23:29:14] <theBrettman> box-direction
[23:29:17] <theBrettman> etc...
[23:29:22] <Cork> its one among meny other implementations
[23:29:34] <theBrettman> it sounds redundant
[23:29:36] <Cork> and its not desided yet witch one will be the standard
[23:29:52] <theBrettman> oh
[23:30:05] <theBrettman> I guess w3schools already decided what they want, lol
[23:30:22] <Cork> ignore w3schools
[23:30:29] <Cork> they don't know what they'r talking about
[23:30:39] <Cork> in any situation
[23:30:46] <radarig> truth.

[23:44:44] <radarig> ('#area a:odd').addClass()'highlight'); ===> ('#area a:odd').addClass('highlight');
[23:44:53] <fulcan> I see
[23:45:30] <fulcan> this didn't work either.  $('#area a:odd').addClass()('highlight');
[23:45:30] <theBrettman> I wonder what happens to everything after the flexbox cuz I had problems with inline elements in ie...
[23:45:43] <radarig> fulcan: that's the same thing you had before
[23:45:44] <theBrettman> ie finally supports inline-block
[23:45:55] <MagePsycho> radarig: http://jsfiddle.net/UcqjX/127/
[23:45:59] <MagePsycho> is it fine radarig
[23:46:18] <fulcan> radarig I tried an earlier script and it wouldn't work either. Its a browser issue?
[23:46:51] <radarig> No, 'highlight' should be within the addClass function.
[23:46:57] <radarig> addClass('highlight');
[23:48:41] <radarig> MagePsycho: Yeah that looks right.
[23:48:49] <fulcan> $('#area a:odd').addClass('highlight');
[23:49:30] <radarig> fulcan: yeah
[23:49:45] <fulcan> radarig still nothing  :(
[23:50:35] <Ortund> hmmm there's a css trick to highlighting alternate elements in a collection... I just can't remember it

[23:54:30] <radarig> fulcan: you're targeting $('#area a:odd'), but you have multiple divs with id="area"
[23:54:47] <radarig> id's are supposed to be unique.
[23:55:07] <radarig> jQuery should only be returning one match instead of all three, which would break the later a:odd lookup.
[23:56:34] <fulcan> radarig I have 3 #area ids because I want jquery to highlight the odd number of them.  ?
[23:56:42] <_rooster_> could somebody look at this and let me know what i am doing wrong?  http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1446233
[23:56:59] <Ortund> fulcan, change them to classes: $('.ares a:odd')
[23:57:12] <Ortund> $('.area a:odd') rather
[23:57:34] <radarig> Yep.
[23:57:36] <Ortund> using #area will only work if there is only 1 <div id="area"> on the page
[23:58:04] <fulcan> radarig that worked!   :)
[23:58:26] <edulterado> iÂ´m trying to add a padding-top to a menu link on hover with css(), but I would like to exclude the a.active link from this, any suggestion on who to handle it?
[23:58:43] <edulterado> *on how
[23:58:53] <Ortund> I was just about to troll you... DAMMIT
