[00:07:09] <HektoR> Hello guys. I just submitted ticket. Please check this out, it's very interesting what you think .... http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12873
[00:09:10] <Cork> HektoR: http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[00:09:20] <Cork> or rather http://api.jquery.com/hover/#hover2
[00:09:25] <Cork> thats what you bind
[00:09:55] <BinaryKitten> Cork you beat me to it
[00:10:29] <Cork> so => invalid :)
[00:11:24] <HektoR> Cork: hi.. so if i don't want to use same function when mouse leaves i have to pass blank anonymouse function as second parameter to hover() ?
[00:11:55] <Cork> HektoR: or just use .on('mouseenter', function() {});
[00:12:14] <Cork> HektoR: hover is just a shorthand
[00:13:24] <Cork> HektoR: its all written in that api page
[00:13:28] <Cork> just read
[00:13:39] <Cork> Calling $(selector).hover(handlerIn, handlerOut) is shorthand for: $(selector).mouseenter(handlerIn).mouseleave(handlerOut);
[00:15:04] <BinaryKitten> which in turn is shorthand for $(selector').on('mouseenter', handlerIn).on('mouseleave', handlerOut);
[00:15:22] <HektoR> Cork: yes but i think it's not lexically correct... hover must mean hover, not hover and leave IMO
[00:15:46] <Cork> with in turn is a short hand for on('mouseover', function(event) { if(event.target !== this) { return; } });
[00:16:22] <BinaryKitten> Hektor your opinion on the lexical correctness has been noted, but unfortunately that's all we can do
[00:16:54] <Cork> HektoR: well if thats the case hover should map against mousemove not enter leave
[00:17:18] <Cork> in this case it calls when it enters and leaves
[00:17:27] <Cork> and mousemove is for each time it moves on it
[00:17:32] <BinaryKitten> HektoR a patch for you:  $.fn.hover = function(handler) { return $(this).mouseenter(handler); };
[00:18:12] <Cork> HektoR: to be picky hover doesn't exist as an event (at all) so....
[00:18:18] <BinaryKitten> that will work to "fix" the issue, but will break pretty much every plugin including jquery ui
[00:18:27] <Cork> and ya, the real event types is a bit weird
[00:18:33] <Cork> but its what we'r stuck with
[00:19:01] <Cork> and it would make hover pointless
[00:19:11] <Cork> you could just use mouseenter in that case
[00:19:20] <BinaryKitten> Cork: agreed...
[00:23:17] <Aphec> Moooooorning
[00:24:45] <HektoR> BinaryKitten: Cork: It's okay for me, but i think it's very confusing ... it must has different name ... hover must mean hover technically and  lexically too
[00:25:13] <Cork> HektoR: name change just for lexical needs won't ever happen
[00:25:40] <Cork> breaking script just for the sake of changing a name is really stupid
[00:27:54] <MiracleBlue> Hey guys
[00:28:43] <HektoR> Cork: I'm agree ... i just mentioned that this may be confusing for some developers ...
[00:29:30] <retrostyle|15> hey dudew
[00:29:33] <retrostyle|15> -w+s
[00:29:42] <MiracleBlue> Yo
[00:32:45] <Aphec> is there an easy way to do a percentage calculation?
[00:33:07] <MiracleBlue> Math!
[00:33:12] <Aphec> for instance if there is a value that needs to be calculated with 5% and added to the total amount?
[00:33:25] <Aphec> i'm just int he beginning of learnign jquery :p
[00:34:40] <HektoR> Aphec: tell us what are you trying exactly ...
[00:35:09] <Aphec> so â€¦ :p
[00:36:16] <Aphec> i got a form
[00:36:18] <Aphec> that i'm working on
[00:36:25] <Aphec> and in the bottom there is a price calculation
[00:36:41] <Aphec> when people select they want a cancellation insurance
[00:36:52] <Aphec> 5% gets added to the total amount.
[00:37:22] <Mandevil> Hi folks.
[00:37:25] <MiracleBlue> Heya
[00:37:31] <Mandevil> I have trouble getting wrap() to work...
[00:37:51] <Mandevil> For some reasion it doesn't seem to do anything: http://jsfiddle.net/7zAbb/
[00:38:10] <HektoR> Aphec: it's just simple math, it's nothing to do with jquery ...
[00:38:36] <Aphec> i'lll pm u my script :p
[00:38:40] <Aphec> maybe u see what i mean hten
[00:38:42] <Aphec> heheh :)
[00:38:56] <HektoR> Aphec: ok, show me ...
[00:39:04] <Aphec> wait just found some stuff :p
[00:44:00] <Mandevil> Hm, it looks like .wrap() doesn't work on elements detached from DOM?
[00:46:05] <Eviltwin> Try .wrap(...).parent()
[00:46:29] <Mandevil> Heh, it's official: wrap (and wrapAll) only works if the element has a parentNode. you should remind this when creating new structures. the creation of a simple list with anchors is a good example.
[00:47:10] <Mandevil> Eviltwin: No, that doesn't seem to work.
[00:47:27] <Mandevil> But nevermind, at least I understand the problem now.
[00:51:34] <Eviltwin> Rather than x.wrap(...) you can do $(...).append(x) if it's just one element
[00:51:51] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/NKdVT/
[00:51:55] <dblosevn> thats what i did
[00:52:13] <dblosevn> Mandevil: @
[00:52:16] <Mandevil> Eviltwin: Yes, you can, just the .wrap() seemd shorter to write.
[00:52:53] <Mandevil> dblosevn: Yeah, that's how I'm going to do it :)
[00:54:02] <Mandevil> BTW, is there anything wrong with x = x.append(y)?
[00:54:08] <dblosevn> i dont get why you would want to anyways though if your building the nodes anyways why not start with the outer wrapper
[00:54:10] <Eviltwin> No
[00:54:11] <dblosevn> and no
[00:54:17] <Eviltwin> But it's a meaningless statement
[00:54:18] <dblosevn> ++Eviltwin
[00:54:49] <Mandevil> dblosevn: I'm creating the node within some loops and logic and only then attaching them to DOM in different part of the code.
[00:55:04] <dblosevn> exactly
[00:55:14] <dblosevn> so start with the wrapper at the top of the loop
[00:55:18] <dblosevn> add the children
[00:55:21] <dblosevn> append to the dom
[00:55:33] <dblosevn> or append to the dom after the loop completes however you want
[00:55:48] <Eviltwin> x.append(y) returns x
[00:55:51] <dblosevn> i see no reason at all to wrap a node that you just created thats not yet in the dom
[00:55:56] <dblosevn> no
[00:56:04] <dblosevn> ya
[00:56:13] <dblosevn> soory thats what i was typing earlier
[00:56:18] <Mandevil> Nevermind, my code works now as intedned.
[00:56:31] <Mandevil> For some reason Firebug doesn't work any more.
[00:56:33] <Mandevil> WTF.
[00:57:01] <dblosevn> one of the reasons i gave up on firefox
[00:57:13] <dblosevn> just close firefox and open it again usually fixes it
[00:57:23] <Mandevil> dblosevn: Yes, that fixed it.
[00:57:28] <dblosevn> that and they realsed 8 versions last yeat
[00:57:34] <dblosevn> *released
[00:57:38] <Mandevil> The built in debugger in FF is nice, but I don't like few things.
[00:57:41] <dblosevn> year
[00:57:52] <dblosevn> the built in debugger in chrome is hardcore
[00:58:05] <Mandevil> I cannot use chrome it seems.
[00:58:07] <dblosevn> doesnt freeze the browser like firebug
[00:58:20] <Mandevil> Is there any simple way to import selfsigned certs there?
[00:58:26] <Mandevil> I tried and I failed miserably.
[00:58:32] <dblosevn> um
[00:58:39] <dblosevn> just go to the site
[00:58:44] <Mandevil> And?
[00:58:45] <dblosevn> and click visit anyways
[00:58:53] <dblosevn> one step
[00:59:00] <dblosevn> firefox 3 steps
[00:59:23] <Mandevil> dblosevn: Don't know how it works for you, but Chrome wants that confirmation every time I go to the site.
[00:59:31] <Mandevil> So that really is no go.
[00:59:36] <dblosevn> hmm
[00:59:38] <dblosevn> weird
[00:59:47] <Mandevil> It's the same on both Linux and Windows.
[00:59:47] <dblosevn> i dont have that issue
[00:59:52] <Mandevil> (Last time I tried).
[01:00:52] <Mandevil> Tried it right now... it still works that way.
[01:01:02] <Mandevil> But do I understand that it's not supposed to?
[01:01:28] <dblosevn> oh
[01:01:39] <dblosevn> ya i have to click it everytime i open the browser
[01:01:51] <dblosevn> not everytime i vist the site
[01:02:02] <Mandevil> It's still annoying as hell.
[01:02:10] <dblosevn> http://superuser.com/questions/27268/how-do-i-disable-the-warning-chrome-gives-if-a-security-certificate-is-not-trust
[01:02:27] <dblosevn> you can add the self signed cert to the trusted store and it wont ask you again
[01:03:37] <Mandevil> Hmmmm....
[01:03:51] <Mandevil> Need to get the cert manually I guess?
[01:04:01] <dblosevn> probally
[01:04:23] <dblosevn> ive never really cared only a couple sites i have that dont have real certs
[01:04:46] <dblosevn> i get free ssl anyways so its just laziness that they dont have certs
[01:05:14] <Mandevil> Well, I might use FF just as well :)
[01:05:28] <dblosevn> and lack of ips lol
[01:06:26] <Mandevil> Also I quite like the Ctrl-Shift-I thingy.
[01:06:48] <dblosevn> works in chrome
[01:06:58] <dblosevn> ctrl shit i
[01:07:06] <dblosevn> opens console
[01:07:41] <dblosevn> shift even
[01:07:46] <Mandevil> That's not what I mean.
[01:08:07] <Mandevil> In FF it opens something like DOM explorer.
[01:08:18] <dblosevn> ya it opens the firefox inspector
[01:08:46] <Mandevil> I like the way it's done, not that Chrome wouldn't have similar feature.
[01:08:53] <dblosevn> now that is cool
[01:09:01] <dblosevn> i may use that occassionally
[01:09:06] <dblosevn> 3d view is hot
[01:09:15] <Mandevil> Never tried 3d.
[01:09:25] <dblosevn> ya
[01:09:31] <Mandevil> Wow.
[01:09:32] <dblosevn> i visualizes all the layers
[01:09:32] <Mandevil> Nifty.
[01:09:40] <dblosevn> *it
[01:11:34] <Mandevil> Seems to not work in WinXP, though.
[01:11:58] <dblosevn> works in win 8
[01:18:26] <Mandevil> Does jQuery do caching of its queries?
[01:18:36] <Mandevil> Or should I store result in variable and reuse it?
[01:21:15] <Cork> Mandevil: no, the cache is your variable
[01:21:15] <xec_> Mandevil: store in var yourself
[01:21:20] <Eviltwin> jQuery intentionally does not cache
[01:21:28] <Mandevil> OK.
[01:21:29] * xec_ highfives Cork
[01:21:31] <Eviltwin> Since there's no cheap way to determine if the results have changed
[01:21:40] <Eviltwin> So the only reasonable thing to do is assume they have
[01:21:50] <Mandevil> Makes sense.
[01:21:55] <Mandevil> I'll cache stuff myself.
[01:22:18] <Cork> well jquery just hands the query off to the backend of the browser
[01:25:19] <Eviltwin> When it can
[01:26:29] <xec_> backend - now in your browser
[01:27:40] <Eviltwin> Heh, compilers and interpreters have front-ends and back-ends
[01:27:52] <Eviltwin> So even the JavaScript engine itself has a front- and back-end
[01:28:31] <xec_> sure, i'm just poking fun.
[01:30:45] <xec_> then again, jQuery is just a layer on top of the front-end, using the dom api
[01:31:22] <xec_> point is that backend is a confusing term :P
[01:31:44] * xec_ hides
[01:35:23] <Cork> heh by backend i meant when you call into the optimized dom api that runs the fast c code
[01:47:54] <politron> good morning
[01:48:14] <politron> somebody here now how to do regular expresions?
[01:48:31] <politron> I'm trying to gran the value inside this A{value}
[01:48:39] <politron> value can change is dynamic
[01:48:45] <politron> the only static is A{ }
[01:48:59] <politron> how can I said I want what I have between A{     }
[01:49:00] <politron> ?
[01:52:06] <mazzachre> Using momentjs, is there a way to construct a moment object knowing only the year and week?
[02:01:45] <sl00> Hi. How can I create a widget i.e button by name (string) instead of $('#mywidget').button() ?
[02:03:37] <xec_> ?eval /A{(.+?)}/.exec("this is A{whatever}")
[02:03:40] <bot-t> xec_: ["A{whatever}", "whatever"]
[02:03:48] <xec_> politron: something like that
[02:04:48] <xec_> you might want the global and caps-insensitive flags, depending on your needs
[02:05:06] <politron> thanks xec let me try
[02:07:53] <koopajah> Hey everyone! Can someone help me with jQuery's datepicker please? I am trying to detect when a user presses TAB/ESC/ENTER and react accordingly, the problem is that the datepicker first goes into onClose callback before letting me detect the key pressed. Is there a way to overload this ?
[02:08:37] <xec_> you could probably just attach your own event listener
[02:08:49] <xec_> i'm not sure what events the datepicker is using though
[02:09:41] <koopajah> I am doing this, binding the keydown event, but still my event is fired after the one of datepicker so it's too late
[02:11:38] <koopajah> Is there a way for my own event listener to be fired before the datepicker's event listener ?
[02:14:02] <faraway> koopajah: do you turn a textfield to a data picker ?
[02:14:16] <faraway> koopajah: datepicker
[02:15:42] <koopajah> faraway > it's a input field
[02:16:11] <faraway> koopajah: do you attach your event listener before or after you turn it to a datepicker ?
[02:17:00] <koopajah> faraway> after! i'll try doing it before
[02:17:52] <faraway> koopajah: the event handlers are called in the order they are attached
[02:18:13] <progzer> Excuse me, I'm trying some stuff with a horizontal layout. I've got a DIV with a UL which has LIs displayed inline-block.
[02:18:24] <progzer> When I use jQuery to find the div's or the ul's width, I seem to get the viewport/window width.
[02:18:28] <xec_> politron: did it work out?
[02:18:42] <koopajah> faraway > which is pretty logical, how did I not try this... Thanks a lot
[02:19:40] <progzer> Hmm guess I can use document.width
[02:21:19] <faraway> koopajah: np ... there is only one difference if you use the .on("event-type", "selector", .... ) the ordering is a little bit different, cause of the propagation ... afiak the handlers directly attached to the elements matching the elements will be called first then the one attached with .on("event-type", "selector", .... ) accourding to the level in the dom
[02:25:55] <koopajah> faraway > thanks for pointing this out in case I move from the bind
[02:27:51] <faraway> koopajah: i'm not completly sure if i pointed that out correctly but i'm pretty sure ... so if directly binding the handler and binding with .on("event", callback) works and .on("event", "selector, callback) does not, you know why ;)
[02:30:56] <koopajah> ok !
[02:42:39] <lombrozo> http://lombrozo.co.uk/test/slider.php - can anyone tell me why my tooltips don't show when I hover over the page dots at the top right please?
[02:43:31] <Mandevil> You should probably simplify your problem to bare core.
[02:43:48] <Mandevil> I wonder who will sift through your whole page too look for problems.
[02:46:55] <faraway> lombrozo: first of all don't use the the on[eventname] tags in html but the jquery's $("selector").on("eventname",callback)  your problem is that the "this" is not reffering to the element where the event happend but the window object
[02:50:32] <lombrozo> faraway: I see, I'll try and rectify, thanks!
[02:55:40] <politron> xec, sorry I will try now
[02:57:17] <politron> xec, you're a gennious!!!!
[02:57:21] <politron> thanks a lot buddy
[02:59:33] <lombrozo> faraway: fantastic, thanks... is that better?
[03:03:36] <faraway> lombrozo: why do you place the script at the end of the page in your document ?
[03:04:23] <Eviltwin> It allows the page to load and render faster
[03:04:49] <lombrozo> faraway: think I copied that from somewhere... why, where should I put it?
[03:05:27] <faraway> Eviltwin: but only if all scripts are at the end ;)
[03:05:50] <Eviltwin> Put one baby script at the top and you won't notice the difference
[03:05:53] <Eviltwin> Put one huge script at the top and you will
[03:06:57] <faraway> Eviltwin: well thats true ... but here it is just the other way round ... i just was asking to get a clue about the knowledge
[03:07:33] <seutje> putting them at the bottom can sometimes cause a FOUC though
[03:08:09] <koopajah> faraway > me again! Sorry! Is there anyway to prevent the datepicker from receiving the event when I catch it in my own event handler? As they are on the same DOM Level, stopPropagation() and preventDefault() does not seem to work
[03:08:12] <Eviltwin> You should design your page so that before any JavaScript has run, it still has style
[03:08:44] <seutje> yet somehow take in account that it has to look differently when there is no js
[03:12:55] <faraway> koopajah: stopPropagation prevents form propagating to the "next level" in the dom hirarchy ... preventDefault, prevents the browsers default action(e.g. following a link) stopImmediatePropagation is what you are looking for
[03:16:30] <koopajah> faraway > woaw, never seen this one before. It now works for each of my key. Thanks a lot for your help!
[03:26:00] <Francis47> Hello - can someone tell me why this doesnt work in IE 9 ? http://jsfiddle.net/73M4U/3/
[03:27:36] <Eviltwin> Change the 'click', function() { to 'click', function(event) {
[03:27:49] <Cork> lol
[03:28:09] <Cork> Francis47: be careful with cases in classes btw
[03:28:18] <Cork> it's not fully supported
[03:28:46] <Francis47> 'click', function(event) { doesnt seem to work
[03:29:02] <Francis47> oh it did ...
[03:29:03] <Francis47> sorry
[03:29:15] <Francis47> beautiful - thank you Eviltwin
[03:29:33] <Francis47> Cork: Thanks for the advise
[03:29:47] <Cork> Francis47: two other things parents will remove all parents with the matched class, you might want to check closest
[03:30:06] <Cork> and as a last warning .live is depricated
[03:30:15] <Cork> use delegated event listeners instead
[03:30:30] <Eviltwin> If you read http://api.jquery.com/live/ it will tell you how to change a .live to the new style
[03:32:23] <Francis47> so basically like this: http://jsfiddle.net/73M4U/4/ ?
[03:32:38] <Eviltwin> No
[03:33:10] <Eviltwin> All you've done is changed the word live to the word on
[03:33:33] <Eviltwin> Please look at their a.offsite example
[03:35:17] <Cork> Francis47: http://jsfiddle.net/73M4U/6/
[03:35:25] <Cork> though thats just a dirty fix
[03:35:34] <Cork> you might want to specify it a bit harder
[03:35:50] * Cork signs out ;)
[03:35:56] <Cork> weekedn!
[03:36:21] <DeltaHeavy> I'm emulating a click on an anchor tag and it acts as if the anchor tag is going in an infinite loop.
[03:36:45] <xec_> also, you probably just want $(this).remove(); in the fadeout calback
[03:36:49] <xec_> callback*
[03:36:55] <DeltaHeavy> $('.launch-item').click(function() {
[03:36:55] <DeltaHeavy> 		$(this).children('div').children('a').click();
[03:36:55] <DeltaHeavy> 	});
[03:37:01] <DeltaHeavy> Crap sorry, I thought that was inline
[03:37:29] <xec_> DeltaHeavy: clicks bubble
[03:37:44] <DeltaHeavy> xec_: Is there any way I can get it to click just once?
[03:37:59] <Eviltwin> Yes
[03:38:09] <Eviltwin> $('.launch-item').click(function(event, ignoreMe) {
[03:38:14] <Eviltwin> if(ignoreMe) return;
[03:38:19] <Eviltwin> $(this).children('div').children('a').click(true);
[03:38:21] <Eviltwin> });
[03:38:27] <xec_> you can prevent propagation or use .one() if you really only want it once
[03:39:42] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks guys. I think I'll look into .one
[03:40:16] <xec_> Eviltwin's solution is probably best
[03:41:10] <xec_> DeltaHeavy: .one() is just like .on(), except it unbinds (removes) itself the first (i.e. only) time it's triggered
[03:41:38] <DeltaHeavy> Ok I see, yeah I'll use Eviltwin's method
[03:47:46] <DeltaHeavy> The click isn't actually triggering anymore with the click(true)
[03:49:50] <xec_> you probably need .trigger("click", true) or something like that instead
[03:49:52] <tankblergh> Hi guys! I'm trying to find out if my accordion is collapsed or opened, and it seems that this class should be in the accordion element : "ui-state-default" , but I can't see it in my browser, and it won't trigger on hasClass. Is it hidden somehow?
[04:07:13] <DeltaHeavy> Duplicated my problem better. Anybody know how ot crack this? I sitll can't get it: http://jsfiddle.net/XmJdN/
[04:10:52] <xec_> DeltaHeavy: http://jsfiddle.net/XmJdN/2/
[04:12:34] <DeltaHeavy> Perfect thanks! Sorry if I was a little slow. 26hours iwthout sleep
[04:14:55] <koopajah> Another question. I'm creating kind of a grid element in my page with a <table>. When using the up arrow key firefox will sometimes move the screen to the far right instead of going up. Do you know what could happen?
[04:16:34] <Trisox> DeltaHeavy: deadline?
[04:20:03] <Mandevil> find('span.rowid').text() ... will this return undefined value in case the 'span.rowid' is not found?
[04:21:10] <DeltaHeavy> Trisox: "THEY WANT IT ON TV TOMORROW SO WE NEED IT AT 7:30AM (at 8:30PM) TO ADVERTISE IT"
[04:21:55] <Myx0x3> have anyone here build any "banner booking system"? our booking system needs an update, but dont know how to design it.. hehe
[04:27:41] <guy> so I get this buggy behaviour with jquery outerWidth that sometimes return randomly big values like 7265 for a 70px wide object, here is a demo https://dev.anuary.com/e12e6e59-daac-5c27-ade3-b0a1ecfde542/
[04:28:29] <guy> if you look at the logic how <ul> width is calculated, this should never happen http://cl.ly/image/3h0e3m2p0424
[04:46:41] <osoba> does anybody know how to supress the default messages for Jquery Tools Validator? http://jsfiddle.net/Tjuu5/ I am trying to just display the "Wrong Code" message without the "please correct this value blablabla" thing too
[04:46:50] <osoba> default error messages*
[04:47:12] <osoba> here is the documentation if anybody is interested but theres nothing there http://jquerytools.org/documentation/validator/index.html
[04:49:10] <koopajah> osoba > http://jquerytools.org/documentation/validator/index.html#input_message
[04:49:37] <MACscr> cant the datepicker plugin also be used just for a simple way to get the current date in a string like so?  var todays_date = $.datepicker.formatDate('yy/mm/dd', new Date());
[04:49:59] <osoba> koopajah: i know of that but that supres...hmm wait
[04:50:02] <osoba> i cant remember why i stopped using that
[04:50:18] <MACscr> doesnt appear to work for me. Im getting an error:  TypeError: $.datepicker is undefined
[04:51:06] <osoba> koopajah: yeah the custom validator doesnt seem to work when i specify the data-message attribute
[04:51:14] <osoba> my custom validator strips all non numbers
[04:51:23] <MACscr> nvm, seems its actually $.datepick
[04:51:48] <koopajah> osoba > http://jquerytools.org/demos/validator/custom-validators.html  when you use custom validator, you can decide the error message to return, no ?
[04:53:42] <osoba> yes, i am using them, look at the jsfiddle, thats the problem, it returns both the default messages AND my message
[04:53:45] <osoba> i want just my message
[04:54:36] <seutje> guys, how do I inject this as an element instead of a textnode? -> var $noscript = $('noscript'); $noscript.html($noscript.contents()[0]);
[04:55:04] <seutje> (basically wanna unwrap noscript stuff)
[04:57:26] <koopajah> osoba > sorry don't know how to correct your code, maybe reask someone else might take a look
[04:57:36] <osoba> i fixed it the other way
[04:57:37] <seutje> ah, text() instead of contents
[04:58:01] <osoba> specified the data-message thing and didnt use a custom validator, just corrected the value with $("#verification-code").oninvalid(function(event, errorMessage) {
[04:58:01] <osoba> 		$(this).val( $(this).val().replace(/[^0-9]/g, '') );
[04:58:01] <osoba> 	});
[05:20:57] <treeprogram> Hi, can someone explain why the javascript following a "for .. in" loop doesn't run? When I comment the for .. in .. loop out, the code following it runs, so that's how I know the for/in loop is causing the subsequent code to be ignored
[05:21:39] <treeprogram> note, the for/in loop contains some jQuery code, which is why I'm here and not in #javascript
[05:23:18] <shoky> ?p @ treeprogram
[05:23:19] <bot-t> treeprogram, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:23:32] <shoky> also.. any errors in your console?
[05:24:58] <treeprogram> shoky I've never used jsfiddle or console, let me check it out

[05:39:21] <MACscr> Any idea what i need to do here to get the radio inputs to be checked by default based on the predefined json string? I swear it was working at one time. All other inputs are working: http://jsfiddle.net/3xjEH/1/
[05:43:44] <rabbite> good morning!
[05:44:26] <faraway> MACscr: first off all ... you need to take creat the the selector you create this way is valid .... own ow your names ends with ? which breaks the loop
[05:47:33] <faraway> MACscr: if you remove the ? it works ... if you don't want or if you can remove the ? you should place the name in quotes [name="sadasdasd?"] in your query
[05:47:58] <MACscr> faraway: ah, stupid. Form generator added that. Thanks for the heads up. Will get that fixed
[05:48:28] <faraway> MACscr: alway take a look in the error console of you browser
[05:48:29] <MACscr> er, "ah, stupid form generator added that"
[05:49:12] <zfmf> he guys i have a question, when i have a function insdie jQuery(document).ready(function() { then i get functionname is not defined when ihave the function outside  then it works, should i write functions outside of document).ready ???
[05:49:19] <MACscr> faraway: i pretty much always do, but i think i need to go to bed. Its 8am and i have been up all night and now im making stupid mistakes obviously
[05:51:26] <faraway> zfmf: well theat depends on the code ... if you call  jQuery(document).ready(function() {  at the time where the dom is already ready, tha callback function is executed immediatly
[05:51:55] <faraway> zfmf: so if this callback uses a function that is defined after this .ready( .... ) block then it is not known at the time of execution
[05:52:57] <faraway> zfmf: but without knowing the code it is not possible to tell you where the problem is
[05:56:04] <rabbite> how would you get the background url of an element>
[05:56:28] <rabbite> jQuery('.live_preview_image').background-url ??
[05:57:00] <zfmf> faraway:  thanks, i think i understand, i have two js files both with jQuery(document).ready(function, and call the function on a click from first JS file,  but the function is in the second js file.
[05:59:17] <rabbite> jQuery('.live_preview_image').css('background-url')
[05:59:20] <faraway> zfmf: the file is not the problem, but the function is only visible for the scope where it is define in
[05:59:21] <rabbite> returns undefined
[05:59:32] <rabbite> semicolon
[06:00:25] <faraway> zfmf: http://jsfiddle.net/X426t/
[06:00:53] <faraway> zfmf: that does not work ... because test1() is only visible in the scope of the first callback function
[06:02:18] <mekwall> faraway> zfmf: so if this callback uses a function that is defined after this .ready( .... ) block then it is not known at the time of execution <--- wat?
[06:02:54] <mekwall> if it's a named function it is available in the scope even if its at the bottom
[06:04:18] <mekwall> faraway: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/Hcyyr/
[06:06:00] <MACscr> faraway: Hmm, actually it always seems to have "No" checked. http://jsfiddle.net/3xjEH/6/
[06:06:53] <evilgeenius> How would I do a numerical comparison in a jquery selector? Is it possible?  e.g.     $('input[data-index>3]')
[06:08:56] <koopajah> evilgeenius > http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2613648/jquery-selecting-all-elements-where-attribute-is-greater-than-a-value
[06:12:33] <rabbite> so i have $current_url = jQuery('.live_preview_image').css('background-image');
[06:12:44] <rabbite> which returns url(http://twitter.com/api/users/profile_image/lenovo)
[06:12:53] <rabbite> how do i get just the url?
[06:12:59] <rabbite> and not url() crap
[06:14:32] <Clex> rabbite: I'm afraid you're gonna have to do some regex.
[06:14:43] <rabbite> now i have two problems
[06:15:07] <Clex> rabbite: http://www.hardcode.nl/archives_139/article_516-background-image-url-getter-setter.htm
[06:15:09] <rabbite> why isn't getting a bg image built into jQuery :/
[06:15:28] <Clex> You're getting the CSS property.
[06:15:36] <Clex> Which is "url(...)".
[06:15:44] <rabbite> ya
[06:15:49] <sCoRpi_> rabbite:
[06:16:08] <sCoRpi_> jQuery('.live_preview_image').css('background-image').match("url\\((.*?)\\)")
[06:16:32] <sCoRpi_> will return an array, will will contain your url as the 2nd element
[06:16:41] <rabbite> ahh, nice
[06:16:53] <rabbite> one line, you sir are a jQuery warrior
[06:17:01] <sCoRpi_> uh, that's just javascript ;)
[06:17:08] <rabbite> sure ;)
[06:17:11] <sCoRpi_> (the part i added that is)
[06:17:35] <rabbite> either way, you rule
[06:18:03] <Tim-_-> i feel the need to wink ;)
[06:18:16] <rabbite> ;)
[06:25:09] <evilgeenius> koopajah: thanks
[06:28:22] <rabbite> $bg_url.setAttribute('background-image').$image_url;
[06:28:28] <rabbite> is that how setAttribute works?
[06:29:58] <rabbite> or like this Query('.live_preview_image').css('background-image').setAttribute($image_url);
[06:31:52] <zfmf> mekwall: faraway: thanks guys , now i understand ;)
[06:37:42] <seutje> rabbite: isn't setAttribute native JS?
[06:38:12] <alvincrespo> @seutje - yes
[06:40:43] <rabbite> seutje: i think so
[06:43:42] <aqeel> hi room
[06:44:09] <alvincrespo> hello
[06:44:12] <aqeel> how in opera can i reinforce the javascript to load forcely...
[06:44:33] <aqeel> its like i have to close the browser and reopen again then will javascript have effect
[06:44:43] <alvincrespo> hmm, JavaScript should load immediately
[06:44:53] <alvincrespo> @aqeel, do you have JS enabled
[06:44:53] <alvincrespo> ?
[06:45:00] <aqeel> else within same session the javascript is having no effect at all
[06:45:11] <aqeel> yes
[06:45:26] <alvincrespo> seems like a caching issue?
[06:45:27] <aqeel> closing and reopeneing the browser shows the changes
[06:45:47] <aqeel> how can i reforce the cache
[06:45:48] <alvincrespo> do you have caching disabled on the browser?
[06:46:00] <aqeel> it is on default settings
[06:46:12] <aqeel> i have not touched any seetings ot browser
[06:46:29] <aqeel> firefox and ie is ok...
[06:46:29] <alvincrespo> im not familiar with opera as much
[06:46:31] <alvincrespo> but if its in its default settings it should be ok
[06:46:32] <alvincrespo> are you developing this application?
[06:46:39] <aqeel> yes
[06:46:48] <aqeel> its a site
[06:47:28] <sethetter> aqeel: Is the JS not having an effect at all? Or are you just not seeing the changes you've made unless you restart the browser?
[06:48:00] <aqeel> i am not seeign the changes after i restart the browser...the later it is
[06:48:35] <sethetter> aqeel: Are you on Windows or Mac?
[06:48:39] <aqeel> windows
[06:48:45] <aqeel> 7 64 bit
[06:48:47] <sethetter> Press Ctrl+F5
[06:49:05] <sethetter> That will force a cache reload
[06:49:24] <aqeel> is there no hard way to code that
[06:50:20] <alvincrespo> you can try cache busting
[06:50:22] <aqeel> well ctrl also seems not to work...
[06:50:26] <sethetter> Not that I'm aware of.
[06:50:37] <alvincrespo> it might be soemthing to do with your server settings
[06:50:41] <sethetter> Yeah I just actually found out that Opera apparently does not support that.. Most browsers do.
[06:50:41] <alvincrespo> it could be a race condition
[06:50:50] <alvincrespo> weird
[06:51:22] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[06:51:37] <aqeel> then chnge your resolution.....close browser and open again
[06:51:50] <mike00> im looking to have an area of an image be selected on a mobile phone - so i can send those dimensions to php and crop - anyone know of this is possible in jquery?
[06:52:26] <aqeel> works perfectly in ie and firefox
[06:52:28] <sethetter> aqeel: Opera says they added support for force cache reload with Ctrl+F5 or with Shift+F5
[06:53:22] <aqeel> but that does not seem to have an effect in my case
[06:53:23] <sethetter> aqeel: http://my.opera.com/community/forums/topic.dml?id=989502#post11996142
[06:53:34] <sethetter> Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're trying to do.
[06:53:56] <alcuadrado> anyone using jquery?
[06:54:01] <alcuadrado> qtip*
[06:54:14] <sethetter> alcuadrado: I don't think anyone in here uses jquery ;)
[06:54:18] <aqeel> no u r not..
[06:54:31] <alcuadrado> lol, I'm an idiot
[06:54:35] <alcuadrado> I meant qtip
[06:54:38] <aqeel> opera 12.10 is what i am on
[06:55:41] <aqeel> anyone tested my site
[06:56:28] <sethetter> aqeel: I went there, what am I testing for? Any particular error I should be seeing?
[06:56:42] <sethetter> alcuadrado: I haven't used it before, but what issue are you having
[06:57:52] <aqeel> change your screen resolutiona nd should alert you with that resolution related message and if u can please see in firefox or ie as to what i mean.......they are working perfectly
[06:58:17] <alcuadrado> my issue was that I've a single-page app, and thought that qtip would leave zombie dom elements. but it's a great plugin, and it automatically calls its destroy method when someone calls $.fn.remove on the associated elements :D
[06:59:10] <sethetter> aqeel: I'm getting an alert box with "Best Resolution" in it whenever the page loads. Regardless of the initial screen size
[06:59:31] <aqeel> sorry not screen size ....your desktop resolution
[06:59:43] <sethetter> alcuadrado: Doesn't sound like much of an issue! lol
[07:00:31] <aqeel> greater>1024x 768 , 1024x768 exact or less and alert accordingly
[07:01:11] <aqeel> if 800x600 should hide .....
[07:01:22] <alcuadrado> sethetter, I was overpreoccupated about smth the author already solved lol
[07:02:01] <sethetter> alcuadrado: gotcha, well good deal then :)
[07:02:15] <sethetter> aqeel: Not seeing anything buddy. I'm on Chrome for mac
[07:02:33] <aqeel> i have yet to test chrome...
[07:02:46] <aqeel> chrome and opera are the two messy browsers...
[07:03:09] <sethetter> aqeel: Funny, it's usually the other way around.
[07:03:22] <aqeel> chrome does not even support resizable=no
[07:06:27] <sethetter> aqeel: From what I'm reading, it sounds like browsers are moving away from allowing non-resizable windows in favor of complete user control of their own windows.
[07:06:53] <sethetter> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1715201/how-can-we-disable-resizing-of-new-popup-window-in-firefox
[07:07:22] <aqeel> agree but still some javascripting can be helped to maintain the structure
[07:07:56] <sethetter> aqeel: Of your layout? That's definitely true.
[07:07:59] <aqeel> the width and height and stuff like that
[07:08:49] <sethetter> aqeel: Right, but you can't stop the user from shrinking the window down. So you either created a fixed-width layout that will simply be slightly hidden when the window is too small, or you build a responsive site that will adapt to the window size.
[07:08:52] <aqeel> chrome does not even go fullscreen though fullscreen is applied
[07:08:55] <sethetter> create*
[07:09:28] <aqeel> yes that is what i am doing responsive site...with min width and min height
[07:10:39] <aqeel> but what i am facing is these browsers are not behaving relative to javascript as others are
[07:10:58] <sethetter> aqeel: I would suggest doing your responsive stuff in CSS as much as possible.
[07:11:17] <sethetter> aqeel: I'm not seeing any media-queries in your CSS.
[07:12:22] <aqeel> media queries i will add later ...i would like to get rid of this cross browser javascript performance error\
[07:14:04] <aqeel> firefox and ie perform as stated in javascripting but opera and chrome are not even that near...
[07:14:33] <aqeel> i thought javascripting was meant to be cross platform
[07:18:51] <khinester> hello, i have an issue with a dialog box and don't seem to see why when i open it, the body document height increases
[07:18:53] <khinester> http://www.associationtsunami.org/ if you rotate the cube left and click on the treble clef you get a dialogbox

[07:22:33] <keebler> Are the newest itterations of jquery fully backwards compatible?
[07:22:39] <keebler> with say. 1.6.4?
[07:22:59] <aqeel> should be but in 1.8.2....alot haqve been removed and replaced
[07:23:19] <keebler> My biggest concern is .live()
[07:23:20] <aqeel> refrain from using depricated stuff
[07:23:25] <keebler> which is deprecated
[07:23:50] <aqeel> it is not fully depricated but some stuff related to it
[07:24:06] <aqeel> though at some point might be fully....
[07:24:58] <keebler> I'm taking over a project that hasn't been updated since 1.6.4, unfortunately they've deployed their product on a few hundred customers and I'm trying to add some new features to it, but I don't want to break what is already existing. :/
[07:25:25] <aqeel> it is a tough call
[07:25:39] <aqeel> 182 is bigchange
[07:25:53] <keebler> Yeah. Gonna call my boss. I was thinking about just upgrading to at least 1.7.
[07:26:08] <aqeel> that can do it
[07:26:29] <aqeel> i have gone through that phase
[07:34:25] <osoba> hmm does jquery 1.8 no support .data() to get stuff from data-something html attributes?
[07:34:29] <osoba> not*
[07:35:15] <gnarf> osoba: it does

[07:44:05] <MaxMeents> can someone point me to the documentation on $('selection')[0] <- need to know what this does

[07:44:34] <osoba> gnarf: is that not what i said? :P
[07:44:52] <MaxMeents> thanks
[07:44:59] <gnarf> no - .data( "events" ) used to map to the actual events bound to an element it has nothing to do with data-* attributes
[07:45:03] <gnarf> why would you think it does?
[07:45:17] <osoba> i dont know :P
[07:45:32] <MaxMeents> whats the diffrence between that and $('selection'[0])?
[07:45:33] <osoba> i dont actually dwell on jquery details, i just program in it
[07:45:42] <osoba> learning as i go
[07:45:49] <seutje> MaxMeents: that would end up as $('s'), no?
[07:45:52] <osoba> MaxMeents: thats not a valid selection
[07:45:57] <seutje> or just type error
[07:45:59] <NoiseEee> MaxMeents: that will return the actual dom element

[08:03:28] <zfly9> Hey guys is there a way to customize a <select> dropdown in a form?
[08:04:45] <timing> zfly9: you can style it a bit with css, but not all platforms accept all styling
[08:04:47] <firstclassfunc>  I have several scripts run. When each is run, index is incremented. When finished, index is decremented and each checks if index == 0 (to see if all scripts are done loading). WIll there a problem with threads accessing potentially old values or other concurrency-related issues?
[08:05:12] <timing> zfly9: We created our own selectboxes
[08:06:51] <zfly9> timing what do you mean
[08:11:07] <timing> zfly9: with html and bound various events to it
[08:12:05] <RLa> how to get the url in jquery-mobile pagechange event handler?

[08:58:09] <NoiseEee> t432: <c:if   if not javascript
[08:58:17] <NoiseEee> is not javascript

[09:05:57] <koichirose> Hello everyone. I need to attach an event in different parts of my website. something like $("#myform").show_loading(), to display a loading gif and disable the form button on submit. What would be the way to go? A plugin?
[09:08:04] <Teduardo> Hi there, can someone take a quick look at this and tell me why jslint is telling me to use === to look for the string '0'? http://jsfiddle.net/my6gs/1/
[09:08:55] <systemfault> Because === is stricter than ==
[09:09:16] <systemfault> jslint is really strict and opinionated on a lot of things.
[09:09:22] <Teduardo> right but if I use === it doesn't hide the text
[09:09:46] <systemfault> Teduardo: That's because .val() returns a string
[09:09:57] <motox> if I bind a mouse click listener to a button, then remove the button from the DOM, then re-add the button with the same ID value that the bind is assinged too, will the bind still work?
[09:10:09] <systemfault> Teduardo: So you would use something like:  if($('#ips').val() === '0') {
[09:10:28] <Teduardo> yeah, except that if i do that it doesn't hide the text
[09:10:45] <Teduardo> it says The rate on this server will increase by $undefined per month
[09:10:48] <systemfault> Teduardo '0' instead of 0  should do it
[09:12:17] <motox> if I bind a mouse click listener to a button, then remove the button from the DOM, then re-add the button with the same ID value that the bind is assigned too, will the bind still work?  Also, if it does not work, will the listener still exist, or is it garbage collected when the element it is attached to is removed from the DOM?
[09:12:45] <BG_> is there a way to reduce the delay on auto-open submenus in jquery ui's menu plugin?
[09:12:47] <motox> sorry for the repost...didnt mean to post the first part twice
[09:13:00] <zfly9> anyone know a good plugin/tutorial on customizing a <select> in a form?
[09:13:05] <systemfault> motox: No, the bind won't work as it's a different node.
[09:13:09] <zfly9> more specifically the 'arrow'
[09:13:23] <systemfault> motox: If the node is not referenced then it will be garbage collected
[09:13:36] <motox> systemfault:  OK, thanks.  Will it still exist?  In otherwords should I delete it when removing the node?
[09:13:41] <NoiseEee> append to systemfault: providing you use a jquery means of removing the element
[09:13:42] <mekwall> Teduardo: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/my6gs/2/
[09:13:44] <motox> OK, excellent.  Thanks
[09:13:52] <NoiseEee> motox: you should use event delegation and forget about it
[09:14:10] <systemfault> NoiseEee: right
[09:14:10] <mekwall> Teduardo: That's how you check truthy/falsey
[09:14:35] <mekwall> Teduardo: And that's why you should use === instead of == when you need to check for an actual value :)
[09:14:41] <koichirose> Hello everyone. I need to attach an event in different parts of my website. something like $("#myform").show_loading(), to display a loading gif and disable the form button on submit. What would be the way to go? A plugin? Could you direct me to some guide? Thanks

[09:15:16] <BG_> ??? jQuery UI's Menu plugin: is there a way to reduce the delay on auto-open submenus?

[09:17:31] <BG_> motox - thanks, the delay exists natively in the plugin, and I want to get rid of it. will this still help me?
[09:18:54] <motox> BG_: Yes.  This one might explain a bit more clearly.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2966611/how-to-delay-hiding-of-a-menu-with-jquery-dropdown-menu

[09:20:25] <nobitanobi_> hi
[09:21:10] <nobitanobi_> Given a table that has the following format <td><span id="x">value</span></td><td><span id="y">value</span></td> --- If I have the id of the second span, how would I access to the value of the first span?
[09:23:27] <MistuhKurtz> nobitanobi_, $("#y").parent().prev().children('span');
[09:23:41] <motox> nobitanobi_:  $('#Y').parent().prev().children().....
[09:23:50] <nobitanobi_> thanks guys
[09:38:22] <nobitanobi_> var my_id = "1234" --- How can I do $('#my_id') ??
[09:38:31] <nobitanobi_> where my_id would be 1234?
[09:38:43] <systemfault> $('#' + my_id) ?
[09:39:08] <Teduardo> anyone know why this would work ok in jsfiddle but not at all in a browser?
[09:39:09] <Teduardo> http://jsfiddle.net/my6gs/1/
[09:39:22] <Ansikt> How do I add a child element to an element?  I suspect Append might be what I want, but I can't quite tell from the wording of the API
[09:39:53] <Ansikt> Teduardo:  Just a guess without looking at your code: onload?
[09:41:06] <Ansikt> Or well, document.ready or w/e
[09:41:12] <MistuhKurtz> Ansikt, append would add it as the last child
[09:41:18] <MistuhKurtz> prepend adds it as the first child
[09:41:23] <Teduardo> It has $(function() { ... {);
[09:41:29] <Ansikt> MistahKurtz:  Awesome sauce :D
[09:43:58] <Ansikt> Teduardo:  Then I got nothin'.
[09:44:25] <nobitanobi_> Interesting...I seee an element in my dom with id="x". When I do $('#x') and I do a console.log of that, I get this: o.fn.o.init  --Why can that be happening?
[09:45:51] <nobitanobi_> My id has "::" in between, can that affect?
[09:48:38] <NoiseEee> nobitanobi_: yep
[09:50:54] <nobitanobi_> This is weird. When I do the console.log, I don't see the HTML element, but a "o.fn.o.init"
[09:51:21] <NoiseEee> nobitanobi_: an id with '::' in it isn't going to play nice in jquery
[09:51:38] <nobitanobi_> I just backslashed it...
[09:51:42] <NoiseEee> nobitanobi_: perhaps you should be using an html data- attribute to store what is obviously data of some sort
[09:51:56] <NoiseEee> nobitanobi_: why do your IDs need :: ?
[09:52:34] <nobitanobi_> NoiseEee: you are right. I inherited this, and all the backend is using this ":" stuff.
[09:52:54] <nobitanobi_> I am just trying to access the element with that ID, to find it's "brother" td
[09:53:58] <gamingdroid> I'm new to jquery, and need to have a convenient way to add (and remove) rows in a table. Each row will have a auto lookup. Any suggestions on where to start? Googling or digging through the archived plugin section isn't very helpful.
[09:55:07] <awc737> http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:55:13] <awc737> is the <input> not supposed to expand or contract with class="spanX" ?
[09:58:04] <NoiseEee> nobitanobi_: use document.getElementById, and then you can probably wrap it in $()
[09:58:38] <nobitanobi_> I was about to str_replace ":" :)
[09:59:35] <Teduardo> anyone know why this works ok in jsfiddle but not in chrome with just the html/script + jquery includes? http://jsfiddle.net/my6gs/3/
[10:00:22] <nobitanobi_> NoiseEee: actually I might be complicating this. If I get a particular span (with an ID), and I want to find it's parent TD, I might not even need to go into the first span ID right?
[10:00:57] <NoiseEee> well it would just be span.closest('td')
[10:06:50] <zfly9> anyone know a good plugin/tutorial on customizing a <select> in a form?
[10:06:52] <zfly9> more specifically the 'arrow'
[10:08:30] <MistuhKurtz> zfly9, let me find a sample i've done before...
[10:09:38] <MistuhKurtz> https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui there's a selectmenu ui plugin in there
[10:09:51] <MistuhKurtz> it's based off of this: http://filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_ui_selectmenu_an_aria_accessible_plugin_for_styling_a_html_select/
[10:10:59] <cat_five> slightly unorthodox question: anybody want to help me come up with an easy, intermediate, and hard jquery syntax interview question?
[10:11:01] <MistuhKurtz> you might wanna search around for similar plugins and figure out which one is the most mature & robust
[10:11:29] <MistuhKurtz> cat_five, easy/intermediate: have them script a gallery
[10:11:47] <MistuhKurtz> intermediate/hard: have them abstract that gallery into a plugin
[10:12:15] <MistuhKurtz> er
[10:12:22] <cat_five> that may be too much, since it's not the only code sample they're writing
[10:12:24] <MistuhKurtz> I guess those tasks are a little big for an interview...
[10:12:26] <cat_five> heh
[10:12:30] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[10:12:55] <MistuhKurtz> i just feel like short little questions don't really speak much of anything
[10:13:16] <cat_five> yeah i think easy is dom traversal
[10:13:34] <cat_five> intermediate, maybe the need for live event delegation?
[10:14:01] <cat_five> hardâ€¦ ajax call?
[10:14:08] <cat_five> but i need some perspective from outside my own head
[10:16:03] <MistuhKurtz> I would much rather read through a code sample together and ask them questions about it
[10:16:08] <MistuhKurtz> have them explain
[10:17:05] <cat_five> that might be a good idea
[10:17:19] <MistuhKurtz> and if I went to an interview with little 'test' questions like that, rather than a larger discussion that seeks to evaluate my critical thinking skills, I would certainly be much less interested
[10:18:15] <cat_five> good point. tbh, i think i'm feeling pressured into doing it because the DBA is giving a written test
[10:18:44] <MistuhKurtz> is the written test something pushed for by HR by any chance?
[10:18:54] <cat_five> nope
[10:19:08] <MistuhKurtz> I really don't know much about DBA so I wouldn't know how to go about hiring for that..
[10:19:29] <cat_five> no the DBA is interviewing the candidate too and wants to give them a written test
[10:19:33] <MistuhKurtz> oh
[10:19:41] <MistuhKurtz> database analyst right?
[10:19:51] <cat_five> so i was thinking well i'll staple a couple coding questions on there
[10:20:03] <MistuhKurtz> idk I might be wrong, I'm pretty new to hiring people
[10:20:21] <cat_five> that makes two of us :)
[10:20:26] <MistuhKurtz> kinda going off my intuition, but I trust it
[10:20:30] <cat_five> i appreciate it!
[10:20:43] <MistuhKurtz> np bouncing ideas around like this is helpful for me too
[10:20:56] <cat_five> i definitely know some of these guys are going to say 'what-query?' :/
[10:21:08] <MistuhKurtz> b/c as soon as we get out of this office (we've reached capacity and we're moving at the end of the month) we need to go on a mad hiring dash
[10:22:00] <MistuhKurtz> yeahh if that's the reply then you can tactfully and nicely make it a quick interview
[10:22:01] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[10:22:29] <MistuhKurtz> actually they shouldn't even make it to the in-person interview if that's the case
[10:22:35] <cat_five> i wish that were the case
[10:22:55] <cat_five> but we're looking for a broad talent, so some strengths and weaknesses are expected
[10:23:01] <MistuhKurtz> what're you looking for?
[10:23:32] <cat_five> basically a bug fixer
[10:23:40] <cat_five> but the more they can offer to actual development, the better
[10:24:11] <MistuhKurtz> what kinda bugs? what languages and software stacks?
[10:25:14] <cat_five> mostly Python, some legacy php, some 3rd party products that need an MS SQL babysitter
[10:25:37] <cat_five> lots of odds and ends; you can see why we'll take help anywhere we can get it :)
[10:25:42] <MistuhKurtz> ah. yes
[10:25:55] <jcromartie> can someone help review my code style https://gist.github.com/966bcb4d889ec62fb858
[10:26:05] <jcromartie> someon says its bad code
[10:26:06] <fission6> how would you check an input field in real time to make sure a user isn't entering a string
[10:26:38] <MistuhKurtz> I could go for some more formatting (spacing, tabs) to make it more readable jcromartie
[10:26:38] <fission6> jcromartie: wont don't they like about it
[10:27:09] <MistuhKurtz> jcromartie, also you never close your click function
[10:27:25] <MistuhKurtz> fission6, you mean you want to make sure they're entering a float or integer?
[10:27:46] <motox> If I load html code into a div via AJAX, is any javascript within the html code executed?
[10:27:54] <jcromartie> OH sorry I forgot that line it's updated now https://gist.github.com/966bcb4d889ec62fb858
[10:27:56] <cat_five> and some people have very strong feelings about long strings of html, and html with embedded styles
[10:28:00] * cat_five is one of those people
[10:28:09] * MistuhKurtz agrees with cat_five 
[10:28:12] <fission6> MistuhKurtz: no want to make sure the string doesn't have a word in it
[10:28:23] <cat_five> regex to the rescue!
[10:28:48] <MistuhKurtz> you want to make sure the string doesn't have a word in it... but not because you're looking for a number... not sure what you're trying to do
[10:29:29] <cat_five> if you just want to check for a string look into https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[10:31:48] <MistuhKurtz> cat_five, instead of asking them to sit and script something like a gallery, you could ask them to describe the approach they would take
[10:32:14] <cat_five> MistuhKurtz: yeah i think i'm going to go with the "read some code together"
[10:32:20] <MistuhKurtz> try coming up with your own answer to that to make sure it's a good question first, lol
[10:32:22] <cat_five> i'll just write something of increasing complexity
[10:32:40] <cat_five> and see where they get uncomfortable
[10:33:02] <MistuhKurtz> if you want to get more advanced you can discuss plugin authoring patterns: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[10:33:40] <MistuhKurtz> oh you mean read through and discuss a code sample *you've* written? I was thinking something they had written
[10:34:04] <cat_five> yeah too late for me to ask them to bring something
[10:34:18] <cat_five> and since they are going to be in a maintenance position anyway...
[10:34:30] <cat_five> READ MY SPAGHETTI, CODE MONKEY
[10:34:35] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[10:34:58] <cat_five> i'll have to do something like this for python too
[10:35:03] <fission6> how would i go about checking if a list of strings ['one', 'two', 'three'] shows up in another string 'some other string'
[10:35:11] <cat_five> but i have real worrrrrk to do! /whine
[10:36:58] <MistuhKurtz> fission6, loop through your array and use indexOf to look for a substring?
[10:37:38] <MistuhKurtz> oh nifty
[10:37:46] <MistuhKurtz> ?inArray @ fission6
[10:37:48] <bot-t> fission6, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[10:38:05] <cat_five> but that will compare the whole string right
[10:38:10] <MistuhKurtz> ohh whoops
[10:38:28] <cat_five> i was trying to think of a way to do it without a loop but i think it's necessary
[10:38:32] <MistuhKurtz> still a nice to know. so yeah, my first idea
[10:39:43] <wachpwnski> How can you run a function for each instance of a element class?
[10:40:11] <MistuhKurtz> $('.class').each(function(i, el){ /* do stuff */ });
[10:40:13] <MistuhKurtz> like that?
[10:40:20] <wachpwnski> Yah
[10:40:27] <MistuhKurtz> isn't jquery wonderful :P
[10:40:28] <wachpwnski> I want to do an ajax request for each module
[10:40:34] <fission6> cat_five: right
[10:40:49] <MistuhKurtz> does that work then wachpwnski ?
[10:40:57] <wachpwnski> Yes sir.
[10:44:48] <cat_five> man writing fake code is hard
[10:44:56] <MistuhKurtz> yeah.. lol
[10:45:22] <MistuhKurtz> it's really too late to ask them for code samples?
[10:48:58] <jcromartie> what does $.data($('#new-visualization-dialogue')[0], 'parent', foo) do
[10:56:13] <jcromartie> why would someone write $.data($('#foo')[0], 'bar', baz)
[10:57:48] <jcromartie> or $.data(document.body, "foo") instead of a global or window variable
[11:00:10] <Eviltwin> The former is a little silly
[11:00:21] <Eviltwin> $('#foo').data('bar', baz) would probably the way to go
[11:00:33] <Eviltwin> Unless they'd already done something like var x = $('#foo')[0];
[11:00:37] <Eviltwin> And then wanted to set some data on x
[11:01:04] <Eviltwin> The latter if you wanted to access the HTML5 data attributes possibly
[11:01:08] <wachpwnski> anyone off hand know how you blink a div?
[11:01:16] <Eviltwin> Like <body data-foo="...">
[11:01:35] <Eviltwin> wachpwnski: "Blink" is pretty vague
[11:01:40] <Eviltwin> Can you be more specific?
[11:01:55] <wachpwnski> Make the background vibe a color?
[11:02:03] <wachpwnski> I know you can blink with fade in and out though too
[11:02:23] <Eviltwin> Fade-in / fade-out is a lot easier to do with jQuery
[11:03:30] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/33jXU/
[11:10:03] <hlve> La comida Mexicana es deliciosa!!!!!!
[11:17:37] <fission6> any easier way to do something liket his, ie. spot check an input for email doesn't have a domain http://jsfiddle.net/FVtTX/1/
[11:18:06] <fusion27> You know how the opposite of .bind() is .unbind().  jQuery Mobile likes us to use .live(), is there an opposite of .live()?
[11:18:14] <cat_five> hah fission and fusion
[11:18:20] <fusion27> lol
[11:18:24] <fusion27> go figure
[11:18:25] <cat_five> NERD FIVE o/
[11:19:05] <cat_five> fission6: it sounds increasingly like you are in the market for a validation plugin
[11:19:10] <xec> fusion27: .live() is deprecated, but i believe .off() was its counterpart
[11:19:23] <cat_five> yeah live is .on() now
[11:19:28] <xec> fusion27: you can use .on() and .off() for the same purposes
[11:19:38] <fusion27> thanks xec!
[11:19:44] * xec high fives cat_five
[11:20:44] <xec> fusion27: but the syntax is a bit different, you can have a read at api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[11:21:42] <xec> (i meant .die() as opposed to .live() earlier, but ignore it)
[11:21:54] <xec> .die() is dead
[11:23:09] <cat_five> heh
[11:27:03] <cat_five> who wants to write fake code with me!

[11:27:57] <zfly9> Hey guys I am trying to use this jquery plugin http://www.adamcoulombe.info/lab/jquery/select-box/ on this site http://www.orangecountycarpetcleaners.org/ to start styling the <select> menu in the footer contact form, it's not calling the plugin tho, any suggestions?
[11:32:26] <zfly9> agh can't figure this out!
[11:35:12] <BG_> jQuery UI Menu Plugin: is there a way to scroll when there are too many items? currently the menu gets out of the visible screen range
[11:37:11] <zfly9> please someone
[11:38:04] <cbarrett1> greetings #jquery, which question about $.get - can you change the responseType to 'arraybuffer'?
[11:38:25] <cbarrett1> would that be the dataType property?
[11:40:57] <cat_five> zfly9: are you sure everything is loading from where you think it is?
[11:41:19] <cat_five> when i try to execute your code in a console, i get a 404 on an arrow image resource
[11:42:29] <barryhjames> Having a problem with jQuery UI Autocomplete, any ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/t5G2v/
[11:43:36] <zfly9> can_five it just doesn't seem to be loading that js
[11:43:49] <zfly9> on the example it places some inline styling, I don't see that on my site
[11:43:54] <zfly9> cat_five
[11:46:12] <cat_five> no it's not. but even if it were, it wouldn't work.
[11:46:32] <Pro|>     $("#muokkaa").html(data).show().slideDown();
[11:46:34] <Pro|> why u no work
[11:46:57] <cat_five> the simplest way to get it to execute is probably just to stick $('select.styled').customSelect(); in a $(document).ready(function(){ }) block
[11:47:45] <cat_five> Pro|: slideDown() only happens if it's not visible
[11:47:56] <cat_five> also your nick is very hard to autocomplete
[11:48:01] <cat_five> :)
[11:48:21] <Pro|> it didn't exist at all
[11:48:30] <Pro|> or yeah it did but it was empty
[11:48:36] <cat_five> that may be, but you are calling .show() so...
[11:48:37] <Pro|> so how to make it dissapear and then make it come up again lol
[11:48:44] <Pro|> didn't work without show too
[11:48:54] <cat_five> hide it with css
[11:49:12] <cat_five> or call hide() prior to html()
[11:49:12] <Pro|> wooah
[11:49:13] <Pro|> thanks
[11:50:30] <cat_five> zfly9: i didn't page you, hope you saw that
[11:50:53] <nerk_> does anyone here develop phonegap apps?
[11:51:39] <cbarrett1> nerk_:  I have
[11:51:58] <nerk_> did you use any form of storage for your app?
[11:52:15] <cbarrett1> yeah, we had local storage using websql
[11:52:23] <cbarrett1> but that is a dead tech
[11:52:25] <nerk_> I am not sure how reliable it would be to base your app around window.localStorage as not all mobile webviews will support it
[11:52:39] <nerk_> yes
[11:52:43] <barryhjames> Having a problem with jQuery UI Autocomplete, any ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/t5G2v/
[11:52:45] <nerk_> in favour of localStorage
[11:52:46] <cbarrett1> you can for sure use localstorage on android and ios
[11:52:54] <nerk_> yah
[11:52:55] <cbarrett1> not sure about the others
[11:53:01] <nerk_> even bb... but not older bb
[11:53:12] <cbarrett1> is bb still around?
[11:53:22] <nerk_> what I have been researching is the native webviews ability to support cookies
[11:53:23] <cbarrett1> lol
[11:53:30] <nerk_> in my industry it is :(
[11:53:32] <nerk_> financial data
[11:53:35] <cbarrett1> ah
[11:53:51] <nerk_> it seems you can make most support local cookie storage
[11:53:59] <nerk_> i've got it working in iOS
[11:54:12] <nerk_> but, that requires adding extra code to most of the phonegap native wrappers
[11:54:13] <cbarrett1> yeah
[11:54:17] <cbarrett1> ah
[11:54:26] <cbarrett1> yeah i've had to do that for other functionality
[11:54:30] <fusion27> nerk_: you seen how you can stringify a JSON object in to local storage then JSON parse when you get it back out of local stroage?
[11:54:33] <cbarrett1> check out the phonegap plugins repo on github
[11:54:42] <friskd> How can i set a event handler for when new elements area added to the dome w/ a given class
[11:54:43] <fusion27> You can kinda roll your own NoSQL solution that way
[11:54:55] <cbarrett1> that's what we were doing ^^
[11:54:57] <nerk_> neat
[11:55:05] <nerk_> as I am basing my whole backend on json
[11:55:15] <cbarrett1> as you should be
[11:55:16] <nerk_> might work well
[11:55:17] <fusion27> I evernoted this
[11:55:31] <fusion27> get new message recorded in appropriate db spot
[11:55:34] <fusion27> woops
[11:55:38] <fusion27> https://www.evernote.com/shard/s2/sh/ef071391-bd01-4373-bdd3-c2fa9ba81655/d1f611d71dbcc271e6f4edea4563a33f
[11:55:48] <cbarrett1> now my question, can I get a response type of 'arraybuffer' using the $.get()?
[11:56:03] <friskd> I tried using the live, but there isn't an "event" for add-to-dom
[11:56:32] <Ansikt> I'm trying to use the masked input jQuery plugin to do a zip code.  I want to be able to accept either 4-digit or 9 digit-with-a-dash style zip codes, and am using the mask 99999-9999.  The problem is, if a user types in only the first five and blurs, the mask plugin will remove the user-text and replace it with the default
[11:56:34] <fusion27> friskd: are you adding with .html()
[11:56:36] <fusion27> ?
[11:56:36] <nerk_> my worry is that I may have to use an alternative in those cases where the webview doesn't support localStorage
[11:56:51] <Ansikt> Does anyone have any suggestions for overwriting this?
[11:57:09] <friskd> fusion27:  usually or append before etc
[11:57:12] <eddiemonge> Ansikt: does it take a reg mask?
[11:57:24] <nerk_> or we just make a supported devices document that details what versions and devices are supported I guess
[11:57:51] <cbarrett1> i guess anywhere where you can shove json might work? :)
[11:57:58] <Ansikt> No, the mask plugin uses a custom mask.  9's for \d, and a's for \w
[11:58:07] <Ansikt> eddiemonge: ^^
[11:58:38] <Ansikt> nerk_: doesn't modernizr support that?
[11:59:03] <fission6> anyone have feedback for http://jsfiddle.net/FVtTX/1/
[11:59:18] <barryhjames> Having a problem with jQuery UI Autocomplete, any ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/t5G2v/
[11:59:20] <fusion27> friskd: something like .html('stuff to move in to DOM').promise().done(function(){}); I can't find it in my code right now
[11:59:45] <Ansikt> If anyone knows another plugin for masked input other than http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/ , that would also be cool.
[12:00:46] <nerk_> Aniskt: maybe!  my boss has a non-upgraded bb
[12:00:50] <nerk_> I'll have to try some shit out
[12:01:04] <nerk_> localStorage is not support on palm
[12:01:13] <nerk_> but who gives a shit
[12:01:15] <nerk_> who uses palm
[12:01:21] <Ansikt>  nerk_: If modernizr is a valid option, it is much easier to use that UA detection
[12:01:34] <Ansikt> so best of luck and whatnot
[12:02:32] <relipse> hey i created a time logger for hourly programmers/contractors, does anyone want to try it out?
[12:02:59] <nerk_> thanks a ton for the suggestion
[12:03:27] <friskd> fusion27:  Yea. I was hopping i could do something that just watch for it as an event or something
[12:03:37] <friskd> The reason being is that im working on an admin tool.
[12:03:51] <friskd> it overlays on top of an existing ui/plugin
[12:03:56] <fusion27> lemme see if I can dig it iout
[12:03:59] <fusion27> pwd
[12:04:01] <fusion27> oops
[12:04:17] <friskd> so i basically want to say (if admin tool){ watch for elements with class x and then do functionZ}
[12:05:42] <knowj> Anyone know why the jQuery UI datepicker.parseDate('dd-mm-yy', new Date(item.created_time)) Would return NaN - NaN - NaN in Safari? http://nottinghamlionsenl.com/gallery/
[12:06:26] <hlve> nan is not a number
[12:06:27] <hlve> soooooo
[12:06:58] <hlve> whatever value it's returning isn't being recognized as a number

[12:08:10] <andi> Hello
[12:08:33] <hlve> o_O
[12:08:51] <hlve> what?
[12:09:14] <wachpwnski> Why would my ajax request be throwing errors, when my response is: 'text/html; charset=utf8' on my api endpoint.
[12:09:56] <andi> I do have a logical question. When I add a click event to a dom element $('#myElem').click(function() { ... }) and change the id of this dom element like $('#myElem').attr('id', 'yourElem');. Will I be able to define a $('#yourElem').click() event which gets triggered after changing the id of the element?
[12:10:42] <wachpwnski> you have to do a live
[12:10:42] <friskd> fusion27:
[12:10:43] <wachpwnski> or bind
[12:10:47] <fusion27> andi: fiddle it, we'll shed some light on this one for you
[12:10:49] <knowj> hlve: The code is technically correct but safari has an issue with it. hence it working in chrome
[12:10:57] <gamingdroid> what is the best way to convert a decimal string to a js arithmetic ready number?
[12:11:26] <barryhjames> Having a problem with jQuery UI Autocomplete, any ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/t5G2v/
[12:11:35] <fusion27> gamingdroid: .toString()?
[12:11:48] <fusion27> converts to string
[12:12:00] <fusion27> parseFloat() converts to decimal
[12:12:03] <gamingdroid> fusion27: the decimal number is already a string, but needs to be converted
[12:12:04] <andi> I'll be back with a small example soon.
[12:12:19] <gamingdroid> fusion27: ah... but does js have anything akin to decimal. I understand float looses precision
[12:12:49] <fusion27> I don't know about that one
[12:13:08] <fusion27> I've never had to get too terribly sexy with JS math
[12:13:31] <fusion27> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parsefloat.asp
[12:14:03] <eddiemonge> gamingdroid: what are you trying to do?
[12:14:12] <NoiseEee> please never link to w3school fusion27
[12:14:42] <systemfault> MDN ;)
[12:14:55] <gamingdroid> eddiemonge: I'm using django, and converting python decimal to json. However, json doesn't support decimals, so I have to convert it to string. I only want 2 decimal places
[12:15:41] <gamingdroid> eddiemonge: I need to do some computation, like final price in js
[12:16:05] <wachpwnski> I'm getting this server side: "GET /route HTTP/1.1" 200 222 2.527633", but my $.ajax request is throwing an error. Any suggestions on what to try next?
[12:16:26] <cat_five> log the error?
[12:17:13] <wachpwnski> cat_five:  good point: Origin http://localhost is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[12:17:23] <eddiemonge> ?eval var str = "12.32"; str*1 + 3;
[12:17:30] <bot-t> eddiemonge: 15.32
[12:17:36] <eddiemonge> gamingdroid: ^^^
[12:18:22] <gamingdroid> eddiemonge: not quite understanding, I'm sort of new to js/jquery. can you be more detailed? :)
[12:18:31] <gamingdroid> are you saying to use eval()
[12:18:42] <eddiemonge> multiple the number string times 1 and it will convert it to a number
[12:18:56] <eddiemonge> assuming it is a number and not something like "a10"
[12:19:11] <gamingdroid> ah
[12:19:14] <cat_five> why that and not parseFloat?
[12:19:21] <andi> http://www.sixhop.net/js-example/ This is what I like to do. Have a look at main.js.
[12:19:36] <shadykhan> can i add !important to css via jquery?
[12:19:43] <gamingdroid> cat_five: that is a good question?
[12:19:52] <andi> It's not possible to just change the id to get the other click function work.
[12:19:55] <eddiemonge> gamingdroid: although im confused why you are getting a string if you are putting the number in json
[12:20:22] <eddiemonge> cat_five: what would you rather write: parseFloat(str) or str*1
[12:21:06] <eddiemonge> if its a more complicated string the parsefloat is fine: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat
[12:21:08] <cat_five> the way i do it is parseFloat, and then Math.round(val*100)/100 for decimal places
[12:21:21] <cat_five> and then a toFixed(2) FOR DISPLAY ONLY
[12:21:23] <gamingdroid> eddiemonge: python has a decimal type, it acts and behaves like real numbers in real life instead of inaccurate floats. python json doesn't serialize Decimals because the only thing it can really convert to is float, but then we are back at the original problem. Now for my application, I only use 2 decimal places so it really is a non-issue
[12:21:58] <eddiemonge> andi: you need to delegate
[12:22:22] <eddiemonge> gamingdroid: huh? you lost me
[12:22:55] <eddiemonge> andi: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:23:22] <gamingdroid> eddiemonge: basically json library in python is unable to convert datastructure to json due to a decimal number type it doesn't support
[12:23:35] <gamingdroid> eddiemonge: therefore I have to make a work around
[12:24:39] <eddiemonge> gamingdroid: weird. another reason i dont like python then
[12:25:09] <gamingdroid> eddiemonge: python is really cool, just too many gotchas mess it up. then again, js isn't exactly nice either.
[12:25:09] <zfly9> cat_five, sorry that didn't work
[12:25:24] <gamingdroid> take the good with the bad! :)
[12:28:11] <niels__> i'm sending a hash through with an order to a thirdparty payment system, i'm fetching the current totalamount from the cart through ajax, in case the user updates quantities or delete items on the checkout page. I somehow need to include that specific javascript string in the md5(). am i missing something? i can't wrap my head around how to fix this. http://pastebin.com/Sk7Ee0FU
[12:28:37] <cat_five> i really think python's json module can dump decimals
[12:31:04] <gamingdroid> cat_five: there is a work around in python by specifying a custom serializer
[12:31:20] <cat_five> honestly gamingdroid i missed the very beginning of your problem
[12:31:32] <cat_five> you are serializing a float and js isn't picking it up?
[12:31:39] <cat_five> or is coercing it to a string?
[12:32:51] <gamingdroid> cat_five: no, I'm serializing a python decimal (not float) and it's coughing up an error about not being able to do so. The solution for me is to convert the decimal to a string in python, then convert it back in JS
[12:33:03] <cat_five> what is the error?
[12:33:31] <gamingdroid> cat_five: "Decimal('179.00') is not JSON serializable"
[12:35:00] <wachpwnski> I know this seems like a dumb thing to do, but if you so var d = $(this);
[12:35:09] <wachpwnski> can you just run d.html() ?
[12:35:43] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: yes
[12:36:07] <cat_five> i see, i guess i was thinking floats
[12:36:14] <cat_five> however SO has your back http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960516/python-json-serialize-a-decimal-object
[12:36:20] <andi> eddiemonge: Ah, with .on() and .off() I'm able to add or remove functions to or from a element. I think I got it.
[12:36:22] <fakingfantastic> Anyone know if you can tell masonry to stop trying to reposition the boxes on window resize, and simply scale them wider, like http://us.burberry.com/store/ does
[12:36:46] <eddiemonge> niels__: you cant combine js and php on the front end. once php generates that page, its done
[12:36:55] <MACscr> hmm, any ideas on how i would do a slider on 100% width items? Its basically a multi step form and i am not 100% sure i how i would animate to slide the divs when there is not a set width on these divs
[12:37:34] <gamingdroid> cat_five: yeah, which is convert the decimal to a string! Now I need to convert it back in JS, but JS doesn' t have a decimal type, so I might as well convert the decimal in python to float and save myself all the trouble. :)
[12:37:48] <cat_five> haha yes i think so
[12:38:09] <cat_five> i think you invented a problem for yourself there ;)
[12:38:24] <andi> Yes, I got the flip flop I'd like to have. Thank you!
[12:38:28] <TelFiRE> Hey if anyone has a minute, would you tell me if this looks overly obfuscated or kludgy? Definitely not perfectly optimized but it's my first larger js project and I just want to know where I stand, and if I'm doing anything horribly wrong. http://jsbin.com/ulevok/1/edit
[12:38:54] <Quix0r> jquery allows me to "register" on 'form submit' event, but not on 'reset'? e.g. when I hit the reset button I want to trigger an own function, currently I do this with the onreset="" attribute in form tag
[12:39:10] <gamingdroid> cat_five: yeah, its funny how you go in circle and only by discussing it with others do you discover it
[12:39:22] <Quix0r> http://api.jquery.com/submit/ <-- that is what i mean
[12:39:56] <NoiseEee> Quix0r: watch the 'click' event of your reset button
[12:40:06] <cat_five> so here is some fake, untested code that i'm thinking about going over with interviewees. i want it to have some simple things, some complex things, and some areas for improvement. what do you think? http://jsfiddle.net/6wV5S/
[12:40:08] <NoiseEee> btw i'm not sure anyone actually hits form reset buttons, do they?
[12:40:15] <Quix0r> ah, okay. i thought there might a similar like http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[12:40:36] <Quix0r> i need it to reset some parts of my form
[12:40:44] <cat_five> TelFiRE: assuming it all works, that is some very nicely formatted code
[12:41:31] <TelFiRE> cat_five: thanks :D it's in action here http://urgentrx.cpstest2.info
[12:42:15] <rhelic_> I have a simple dual multiselector and I want to add doubleclick functionality to the items in the select box, to toggle them back and forth, but my first attempted failed (commented out) any suggestions?  http://jsfiddle.net/bUsHT/3/
[12:42:19] <TelFiRE> I think it might be bad that I have global variables and global functions but I couldn't get the setTimeout() to work if my function wasn't global :s
[12:43:07] <cat_five> looks sharp. i don't get the resizable panel on larger resolutions though
[12:43:47] <Quix0r> okay, i try it what you have suggested :)
[12:43:50] <TelFiRE> eh it's weird
[12:43:56] <TelFiRE> the client had some very specific, and very odd requests
[12:45:24] <cat_five> have you ever looked into backbone TelFiRE
[12:46:45] <cat_five> also someone tell me about my interview code already! is it too easy? too much? http://jsfiddle.net/6wV5S/
[12:47:57] <brainwarped> Hi! I'm having trouble adding autocomplete to a JSTree. Is there a certain way to pass the data to autocomplete and then pass the correct nodes back to jstree?
[12:50:06] <brainwarped> This is my html so far: http://dpaste.org/IPnw9/
[12:50:27] <brainwarped> well, its moreso just the javascript
[12:50:47] <hlve> brainwarped: jsfiddle.net plz
[12:51:18] <Sempi> Hi, i have a problem converting an old live() to the newer on() ., but the behaviour is not what i would expect. What should happen is that a change in any one element should update all elements. Which works fine in live(), but doesnt do a thing in on(). My code: http://pastebin.com/GUR5HZfK
[12:51:52] <Sempi> changing one element works fine.. just not all of them
[12:52:36] <eddiemonge> Sempi: what is *#smurl?
[12:52:42] <cat_five> my question as well
[12:52:44] <eddiemonge> and what new code are you trying?
[12:52:54] <Sempi> thats all of the id's of teh same element type
[12:53:17] <cat_five> on should just be a drop in replacement on that if it's a <select> element
[12:53:23] <Sempi> i switched live with on, since according to the jquery docs the structure is the same
[12:53:47] <cat_five> you have more than one element with the same id?
[12:54:02] <Sempi> yea about 50 which all needs to be changed/updated
[12:54:14] <cat_five> id's are supposed to be unique
[12:54:20] <brainwarped> hlve: I'm not sure jsfiddle will work... I can tell you the only error is trying to use appendto to push the nodes back to jstree...
[12:54:21] <Sempi> could that be it?
[12:54:32] <cat_five> what type of element is it
[12:54:41] <systemfault> If you have more than a single element with a specific ID then your HTML is invalid.
[12:54:50] <Sempi> #smurl is of type INPUT
[12:55:01] <cat_five> it could still *work* though
[12:55:04] <zfly9> Hey guys I am trying to use this jquery plugin http://www.adamcoulombe.info/lab/jquery/select-box/ on this site http://www.orangecountycarpetcleaners.org/ to start styling the <select> menu in the footer contact form, it's not calling the plugin tho, any suggestions?
[12:55:05] <cat_five> text input?
[12:55:08] <Sempi> yep
[12:55:22] <cat_five> i listen on keyup on text inputs
[12:55:52] <Sempi> i'll quickly switch it to a class
[12:57:57] <Sempi> Nah switching it to classes didnt work
[12:58:52] <_BigWings_> does anyone know if doing $('#mySelector').val(bla)   every frame is a bad idea?
[12:59:16] <TelFiRE> cat_five: I haven't I will google it now
[12:59:42] <_BigWings_> should should I store my selector in a variable instead?   var myselector = $('#myselector')
[12:59:55] <systemfault> Sempi: $(selector).live(eventType, handler) simply becomes $(document).on(eventType, selector, handler);
[12:59:58] <_BigWings_> and then just use   myselector.val(bla)
[13:00:04] <LessSeen> yep
[13:00:10] <_BigWings_> or doesn't it matter speed wise?
[13:00:19] <systemfault> _BigWings_: You should always cache your selectors.
[13:00:39] <_BigWings_> ok
[13:00:51] <systemfault> _BigWings_: It probably won't matter much in a 3 lines javascript script.... but in a bigger app, you'll kill the performance.
[13:01:03] <systemfault> All DOM node selections are slow.
[13:02:56] <_BigWings_> thats what I thought
[13:03:00] <_BigWings_> just wanted to make sure
[13:05:52] <Kythlo> Hi, guy im trying to replicate navigation bar from this site. But I am stuck on on the frame that surrounds the submenu and main nav. Any ideas on how i can get this done? . Here is the site i a copying.http://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us. Here is what I have so far. https://dl.dropbox.com/u/119504375/Website/index.html
[13:06:54] <Kythlo> Only my first button is working right now
[13:08:24] <Sempi> I kind of solved my #smurl problem now by duplicating the same code. One for on(click), and then an each(), to update all elements, and on(change) to update just teh one i just changed
[13:08:35] <Sempi> not a real solution, but that seems to work
[13:09:53] <Sempi> just bugs me that live() isnt doing the same thing that on() does, while supposedly on() is better :)
[13:12:19] <Kythlo> Would anyone have any insight on how to achieve the frame on the halo site?
[13:15:21] <cat_five> you're not kidding when you say you're copying itâ€¦ hope that's strictly academic
[13:17:28] <cat_five> there are many ways you could do it, the easiest is just to make the frame part of the link background image and have it overlap the menu
[13:17:55] <Kythlo> hmmm.
[13:18:21] <Kythlo> id have to overlap it with some jquery ?
[13:18:30] <cat_five> you could use css
[13:19:35] <mdhopkins> Hi, does anyone know why I'd be getting this error in IE8? seems like a harmless statement. http://imgur.com/oxNd8
[13:19:46] <Kythlo> won't like cover the submenu and destroy the submenu hover?
[13:21:13] <dblosevn> mdhopkins: check the double quotes around the div they might not be double quotes and actually high-bit chars
[13:21:22] <|pez|> &win 35
[13:22:04] <cat_five> no they only have to overlap by 1 pixel, to hide the blue border of the submenu where the menu link touches it, Kythlo
[13:28:03] <mdhopkins> dblosevn: I needed to add var in front of content
[13:33:51] <jita> Can i combine gt and lt selectors like :gt(5):lt(10)
[13:34:37] <dabear_> jita: you can
[13:34:52] <dabear_> those selectors are slow though
[13:35:03] <dabear_> but you still can, if you want :)
[13:35:38] <dabear_> ( .slice() would be better)
[13:35:54] <jita> http://dpaste.org/YrYWC/
[13:36:01] <jita> i get ILLEGAL token error
[13:36:02] <jita> in this code
[13:38:01] <dabear_> jita: yep, that is to be expected as it is not valid javascript
[13:39:01] <dabear_> you have an odd number of apostophes
[13:41:02] <barryhjames> I am having some trouble with a jQuery Autocomplete.  I thought I had the code right, but I must be missing something.  Any ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/WpQTX/1/  It's just a simple country autocomplete.
[13:43:38] <wachpwnski> how do you select a value for a key in a json string?
[13:44:58] <dabear_> barryhjames: look at the chrome console, or run your code through jshint/jslint
[13:45:49] <dabear_> you are lacking an end parenthesis, barryhjames
[13:47:15] <barryhjames> dabear_: I'm not seeing where.
[13:47:47] <jita> dabear_, is there any more elegant solution for my problem?
[13:47:58] <dabear_> barryhjames: then discover where by letting jshint.com help you
[13:56:21] <barryhjames> dabear_: Missing "use strict" statement. What does this mean?  I have checked and cannot find the missing parenthesis anywhere, checked through jslint.
[13:57:11] <dabear_> barryhjames: google it. not all errors are relevant
[13:57:44] <dabear_> they simply state you are not following what the authors of jshint believes is best practice
[13:58:13] <gamingdroid> how does the callback function find the jquery selector object that called it?
[13:58:15] <dabear_> but other erros about "missing x, expected y" are more relevant
[13:58:57] <dabear_> gamingdroid: usually that isn't needed
[13:59:19] <achunin> Has anyone experienced choppy animations when there's a Flash object on the page?
[13:59:37] <gamingdroid> dabear_: I have a table with rows, and I need to update the row when a focusout occurs so I need to know what row fired the event.
[14:00:59] <dabear_> gamingdroid: this.target, this.relatedTarget wouldn't give you what you need?
[14:10:15] <luv> hello
[14:10:16] <bot-t> (239 hours ago) <coldhead> tell luv THANKS FOR QUITTING AND JOINING AGAIN
[14:10:26] <luv> :-)
[14:11:01] <systemfault> o_O
[14:11:06] <systemfault> It's been a while
[14:11:22] <luv> haha, sure :-)
[14:11:37] <luv> anyway i am trying to understand this cryptic jquery code
[14:11:54] <luv> (function ($) { blablabla })(jQuery())
[14:12:00] <luv> does it make sense?
[14:12:25] <luv> my humble guess it's a variation on $(document).ready
[14:13:41] <systemfault> Nope.
[14:13:53] <systemfault> (function ($) { blablabla })(jQuery) would make sense though
[14:14:08] <systemfault> And no, it's not a variation of the $(document).ready
[14:14:24] <dblosevn> ya that executes immediately
[14:14:27] <systemfault> It's a classic example of the JS module pattern
[14:14:46] <dblosevn> and passes jquery in as $
[14:15:09] <luv> yes you are right
[14:18:13] <luv> to my eyes it be worth sacrificing one name for the sake of readibility
[14:19:00] <luv> but i undestand that because it's part of api which is loaded and evaluated by any client whatsover, they can't afford poluting the namespace
[14:22:30] <someprimetime> why can't jsfiddle be fast all the time?
[14:22:34] <someprimetime> i'll pay a fee for it if i need to
[14:23:23] <PackRatDragon> I have a question... I am have three groups of radio buttons.. I want to hide the second two option groups based on the selected item in the first group.  Problem... Here is the problem...  I can't change the name of the option input as that screws things up with the rest of the validation code, so something like this 	$("input[name$='myname").click(function()  won't work.
[14:24:05] <PackRatDragon> I can capture the two values I need, is there a way to add the click(function()) to all inputs?
[14:24:21] <razzi> PackRatDragon, you are missing a square bracket
[14:24:59] <PackRatDragon> sorry... that was a typing mistake.. it is correct in the code...
[14:25:05] <someprimetime> razzi: i bet that's just what he typed to ask the question not the actual code
[14:25:21] <razzi> PackRatDragon, what you want to do is not clear , not to me at least.
[14:25:36] <someprimetime> PackRatDragon: post a fiddle
[14:25:42] <barryhjames> dabear_: Still no clue.  I have jslint'ed it, and it says no errors.  Rechecked the code against 2 different examples I found online, and it matches up perfectly.  Really not sure what I am doing wrong here.  http://jsfiddle.net/RH8N3/
[14:25:50] <PackRatDragon> fiddle?
[14:26:48] <barryhjames> But I'll take help from anyone who has a suggestion!
[14:26:52] <someprimetime> barryhjames: http://jsfiddle.net/RH8N3/1/
[14:26:56] <someprimetime> you need to include jquery ui
[14:27:17] <PackRatDragon> How do I add 	$("input[name$='bla']").click(function()  when I don't know what 'bla' is going to be.  The name of the input that I am adding the click function to, depends on what product they are selecting
[14:28:33] <wachpwnski> Instead of appendTo is there a replace?
[14:28:33] <ralf_> hey, is there somethin wrong with jqplot? if i search in google i get a warning somethin like "website is possible manipulated"
[14:28:54] <systemfault> replaceWith IIRC
[14:28:55] <razzi> PackRatDragon, there must be some way to identify those radio buttons, if there isn't you can't select them exclusively of course.
[14:29:31] <razzi> PackRatDragon, what about their positions in the mark-up?
[14:29:42] <wachpwnski> That is not the same.
[14:30:19] <barryhjames> someprimetime: And how do I get it to display the name of the country in the drop down instead of the abbreviation?  http://jsfiddle.net/RH8N3/2/
[14:30:34] <someprimetime> barryhjames: it does show the name
[14:30:34] <PackRatDragon> Here is the problem... if I specify a name for the inputs, set all of them to say, 'myradio', then the validation fails, because it doesn't see that an option was chosen.
[14:30:36] <someprimetime> you have to mousedown
[14:30:45] <someprimetime> you've got other issues going on and i don't really use jquery ui
[14:30:55] <someprimetime> maybe the dropdown div needs a display: block on it
[14:31:11] <PackRatDragon> The name of the input is based on the option-id associated with the product.
[14:31:42] <PackRatDragon> so I have no idea how to assign the click to the radio buttons.
[14:32:01] <razzi> PackRatDragon, you have link?
[14:32:48] <someprimetime> barryhjames: sorry meant keydown
[14:32:52] <someprimetime> if you type: "AF" and keydown
[14:32:53] <someprimetime> it'll complete
[14:33:16] <wachpwnski> http://bpaste.net/show/0tm5JqNFhFb8Iackv1zO/ I am doing this
[14:33:32] <mats_> $('<iframe width="300" height="300" src="this.href"></iframe>').appendTo(this.parentNode); - this obviously doesn't work with the this.href, but how should it be done correct?
[14:33:36] <barryhjames> someprimetime: Right, but in the actual drop down part, I would like it to say "United States" instead of "US" without keying down. Is that in the configuration of the json?
[14:33:53] <wachpwnski> can I just do something like parent.replaceWith('<ul/>, {'html': list.join('')});
[14:34:10] <someprimetime> barryhjames: i'm not sure maybe someone who uses jquery ui would know better. sorry
[14:34:23] <HarryPitfall> mats_, what url you want to open?
[14:35:54] <luv> thanks guys, got it :-) now I can play songs from soundcloud with mplayer
[14:36:00] <luv> was too easy though :-)
[14:37:17] <PackRatDragon> http://pastebin.com/um3Qx21Q    <-- this is only a snippet of the entire code....
[14:38:18] <PackRatDragon> line 44 is where the input is defined.
[14:38:37] <mats_> HarryPitfall: i want to open the href of the a tag which is clicked, that's why i tried with this.href - which didn't work :)
[14:39:36] <HarryPitfall> $('<iframe/>', { width: 300, height: 300, src: this.href }).appendTo(this.parentNode)
[14:43:18] <shoky> PackRatDragon: give your inputs a shared class like 'myradioclass' and then you can: $('.myradioclass').click(...)  or with event delegation:  $('#staticContainer').on('click', '.myradioclass', function() { ... })   and inside 'this' will be the clicked input
[14:43:27] <mats_> HarryPitfall: oh, so you put all attributes after the elements? interesting
[14:43:40] <HarryPitfall> I like this way
[14:44:46] <PackRatDragon> shoky I can't do that.... when I tried that, the product failed when checking to see if the required option (first option) was specified
[14:45:16] <shoky> huh?
[14:45:31] <shoky> you can't add a class to your elements? ..
[14:45:45] <PackRatDragon> wait...
[14:46:01] <PackRatDragon> I'm sorry... I thought you meant to give them a name... sorrry
[14:46:22] <shoky> np
[14:46:52] <PackRatDragon> Ok.. so give them shared class rather than specifying a name
[14:47:21] <mats_> HarryPitfall: well, it works fine. so thanks for the help :)
[14:47:34] <shoky> fyi you can also do something like.. $('input[type=radio]').click(.. or $(':radio').click(..
[14:48:03] <shoky> or with delegation.. $(document).on('click', ':radio', function..
[14:48:14] <shoky> to handle all radios
[14:48:26] <shoky> (but use a class)
[14:50:24] <PackRatDragon> well that works... since all products have the same set of options, I can capture the id of  the opton, based on it's name with php.. but using the class will make it easier
[14:50:34] <PackRatDragon> for the input part
[14:50:46] <shoky> that's what classes are for yap
[14:53:37] <PackRatDragon> well I always seem to try the hard way first....
[14:53:52] <PackRatDragon> maybe I am secretly a masachist
[14:59:06] <wachpwnski> is there a way to execute a function according to a string name?
[14:59:43] <wachpwnski> Like if(obj.id == 'my_div_id'):
[14:59:59] <PackRatDragon> do I still need the function() when using the class?
[15:00:58] <barryhjames> Thanks someprimetime.  I think what's happening is that my PHP script is not properly translating my code into JSON, because when I type the values directly into the script, it works fine, but when I try to bring the values over from a JSON encoded PHP file, it doesn't work.  I performed a $get on the PHP file, so I know it is being called correctly, just can't seem to make the JSON work.
[15:01:09] <someprimetime> hmm
[15:01:20] <barryhjames> someprimetime: It looks correct, though, when I just echo the code to the page.
[15:01:32] <someprimetime> make sure your ajax request type is 'json'
[15:05:50] <barryhjames> someprimetime: Just changed the dataType to json and it still is not working.  At such a loss here.  Any other ideas?  Are you familiar with PHP at all?
[15:06:00] <barryhjames> I know this isn't a PHP room.
[15:06:09] <razzi> barryhjames, have you considered character encoding?
[15:06:20] <razzi> JS works with utf-8
[15:06:27] <razzi> PHP not necessarily so
[15:06:29] <someprimetime> barryhjames: what happens when you print_r($data); within php?
[15:06:36] <someprimetime> is it showing it in an array?
[15:07:04] <systemfault> Is the PHP array json_encoded? Did you change the Content-Type HTTP header?
[15:07:27] <barryhjames> someprimetime: Yes, it is showing it in an array.
[15:07:57] <barryhjames> systemfault: Yes, I have echo json_encode($countries); in the PHP file.
[15:09:00] <jstroem_> what do you get as the output barryhjames?
[15:09:25] <barryhjames> jstroem_: For the print array or the json_encode echoed?
[15:09:39] <jstroem> json_encode
[15:11:47] <barryhjames> jstroem: ["Afghanistan","Albania","Algeria"] etc etc
[15:12:36] <jstroem> barryhjames: and how do you parse it in JS?
[15:12:52] <barryhjames> jstroem: And here is my code that I am using (obviously won't work on jsfiddle because of the file call, but just to show you)â€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/RH8N3/6/
[15:13:29] <ziz> can someone tell me what I am doing wrong here, trying to get this http://jamielottering.github.com/DropKick/ to work on http://www.orangecountycarpetcleaners.org/ to customize the <select> on the footer menu and it's just not taking..
[15:14:47] <jstroem> barryhjames: the php output, do you have any "hidden outputs"? warnings not shown etc.
[15:14:58] <ziz> my contact form html is called via JS so I'm wondering if that has something to do w it
[15:15:22] <MattBrotz> If a element is hidden will I be able to check the value as if it did exist?
[15:16:03] <MattBrotz> using .hide()
[15:17:03] <barryhjames>  jstroem: Here is my PHP http://pastebin.com/gQa7ffzQ
[15:17:37] <barryhjames> jstroem: Just a simple call to the db and turning the results into json.
[15:20:00] <ziz> anyone por favor? been at this for hrs
[15:21:40] <jstroem> barryhjames: Then the only thing i can think of is the charset
[15:23:45] <jstroem> ziz: you have an error in line 4 of your datepicker script
[15:24:31] <barryhjames> jstroem: UTF-8 is what I have the site set on, as well as the db. Do I need to set it in jQuery as well?
[15:24:51] <jstroem> no js is utf8 default
[15:25:11] <jstroem> barryhjames: you dont get any errors and you dont have any wierd chars in your countries names?
[15:25:53] <barryhjames> jstroem: There are a few ampersands in some of the country names.
[15:26:07] <barryhjames> jstroem: Could that be it?
[15:26:12] <jstroem> barryhjames: yep
[15:27:01] <barryhjames> jstroem: It's pulling from the db, though. So I have to unicode them in the db?
[15:28:05] <jstroem> barryhjames: hmm try just take select top 5 and see if it works.. if so it because of some chars in the countries
[15:29:16] <barryhjames> jstroem: Just selected top 5 and it still doesn't work.
[15:30:22] <jstroem> barryhjames: have you made the GET request through curl and seen the headers etc.?
[15:32:23] <barryhjames> jstroem: let me try
[15:42:43] <ziz> jstroem, I was able to get it to work on a <select> that is outside of that form
[15:43:30] <gamingdroid> I need to find out the type of an object being returned. Any ideas?
[15:45:15] <shoky> gamingdroid: whatcha mean?
[15:45:20] <ziz> jstroem and error is fixed
[15:46:18] <jstroem> ziz: great!
[15:46:36] <gamingdroid> shoky: basically, I don't know what quantity is in this code: http://dpaste.com/828369/
[15:46:46] <barryhjames> jatroem: what should i be looking for in the headers?
[15:46:51] <ziz> jstroem but I'm unable to get it on the contact form that is loaded via js
[15:47:23] <jstroem> ziz: loading it via. AJAX?
[15:47:41] <ziz> it's being called via javascript
[15:47:42] <shoky> gamingdroid: that javascript is kinda off first of all..
[15:48:24] <jstroem> ziz: Could be because your events is set before the elements is on the page? try to reset the events once the elements is loaded.
[15:48:25] <shoky> gamingdroid: umm i still dont understand what you want really.. quantity doesnt even have siblings
[15:49:13] <gamingdroid> shoky: I updated the code now, to better illustrate it http://dpaste.com/828371/
[15:49:15] <ziz> jstroem how?
[15:49:58] <shoky> gamingdroid: shouldn't that be .siblings('[name="quantity"]');
[15:50:21] <shoky> gamingdroid: otherwise it's still not javascript..
[15:51:48] <shoky> gamingdroid: and still, what do you mean/want..?  the 'name' input and the 'quantity' input aren't even siblings..
[15:51:49] <gamingdroid> shoky: what is wrong with it?
[15:52:10] <gamingdroid> shoky: did you reference the table below it?
[15:52:26] <shoky> gamingdroid: strings (such as '[name="quantity"]' ) need to be surrounded in quotes..
[15:52:41] <gamingdroid> shoky: yeah, I fixed that just now :)
[15:52:45] <jstroem> ziz: Correct your creating the contact form in contact.js right?.. so once you changed the innerHTML you can set the events
[15:52:52] <gamingdroid> shoky: still not working though
[15:53:06] <shoky> gamingdroid: yes, i did.. each of those <input>s are single-children. they dont have siblings, they are alone in a <td>
[15:53:26] <shoky> gamingdroid: "still not working" ?? you never said anything isn't working
[15:54:06] <gamingdroid> shoky: so how do I get to the next column and access the right input field with name=quantity?
[15:55:11] <shoky> gamingdroid: many ways.. i dont see your full html so i dont know whats best for your case.. (and if that IS the full html then your code is really too complex)
[15:55:34] <gamingdroid> shoky: that is pretty much the full html
[15:55:52] <gamingdroid> shoky: at least the relevant part
[15:59:47] <ziz> jstroem, um yes I am creating via contact.js, but not sure what you said after that
[16:01:01] <jstroem> ziz: you wanna change the select from the contact.js right? so you need to do it after you made the innerHTML and not before
[16:02:41] <shoky> gamingdroid: maybe you want this donno.. http://jsfiddle.net/YPa5R/1/
[16:04:29] <gamingdroid> shoky: not quite, because when I add a row, it updates the entire column: http://jsfiddle.net/YPa5R/1/
[16:04:59] <gamingdroid> shoky: I need only the adjacent quantity in the same row to update, not the entire column
[16:05:34] <shoky> gamingdroid: $(this).closest('tr').find('[name=quantity]')
[16:06:14] <shoky> that's why i asked about the full html..
[16:06:46] <gamingdroid> shocky: gotcha. I will keep that in mind.
[16:06:49] <shoky> gamingdroid: btw you linked to the same fiddle i linked..
[16:06:57] <knite> anyone here using the DataTables lib?
[16:07:31] <knite> trying to dynamically specify my columns/headers. sAjaxSource isn't expecting a header row, and there's corresponding AJAX method for aoClumns...
[16:07:32] <gamingdroid> shoky: oh... well it works now. :)
[16:07:43] <knite> there's isn't a*
[16:07:51] <gamingdroid> shoky: thank you thank you! big :)
[16:08:10] <shoky> np ;]
[16:08:36] <gamingdroid> shoky: by the way, when you say "this", what is it referencing?
[16:09:40] <shoky> gamingdroid: the element where the event was triggered, usually (or always?) the same as event.currentTarget
[16:09:57] <gamingdroid> shoky: gotcha.
[16:44:29] <m0ntra> friendly hello to everyone in the channel :)
[16:44:54] <m0ntra> would love some help with jquery-ui if anyone's around
[16:45:19] <shoky> m0ntra: ask ;]
[16:46:11] <m0ntra> trying to use a jquery module (the one for tabs) on a website, but I am getting an error in the console here
[16:46:23] <m0ntra> TypeError: $(".colorpicker").colorPicker is not a function
[16:46:37] <m0ntra> I'm not using that function though, is this common at all?
[16:46:47] <shoky> er, you're not?
[16:47:14] <shoky> do you have a link?
[16:47:17] <m0ntra> nevermind! not a jquery problem

[16:55:06] <m0ntra> this look right?
[16:55:07] <m0ntra> /ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.9.1/jquery-ui.min.js
[16:57:40] <m0ntra> still getting this colorpicker error hmm..
[16:58:16] <m0ntra> I'm just trying to test this simple tabs example found here http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[16:58:35] <m0ntra> the code for that is going into a .php file executing html
[16:58:49] <m0ntra> and the error is coming from a .js file that i've created to keep all my custome js functions

[17:03:07] <Zuchto> Hey, I'm pretty new to webdevelopment so please be gentle. I'm trying to compress my assets but when I, for example, concatenate jquery and jquery custom scrollbars plugin into one file the second complains about "uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" right at the beginning that says (function($){.
[17:03:31] <Zuchto> It works prefectly fine if all the files are loaded separately
[17:04:18] <batmanbond3d> try adding a semi colon to the end of the file
[17:06:32] <Zuchto> hahaha, wonderful. Thanks batmanbond3d! That did it
[17:06:40] <ericelliott> lol
[17:07:12] <batmanbond3d> np
[17:23:00] <acidjazz> when in a lcick handler.. whats hte best way to back out of the element and search for the same class to like remove the active state?

[17:46:57] <batmanbond3d> give the label an id
[17:47:21] <batmanbond3d> then just $('#labelId').html('what ever you want')
[17:48:06] <vacho> it does not have a id man
[17:48:06] <vacho> cmon

[17:58:49] <mdedetrich> I am getting an initial stutter on an animation, at which pointer afterwards the animations are really smooth
[17:58:54] <mdedetrich> any idea what could be doing this
[18:02:24] <mdedetrich> also the animations appear to be choppy in FF
[18:02:39] <MrPunkin> Will binding a click handler onto the same element double up the handlers? It's the same function being bound again.
[18:03:04] <MrPunkin> Do I need to monitor to only bind once, or will it be okay?
[18:12:25] <fission6> fiddle it MrPunkin
[18:13:22] <MrPunkin> Why? This isn't code specific. I just need to know if $('.myel).click(function(){â€¦}); called twice will be triggered twice or if it will only trigger the function once
[18:14:51] <fission6> http://jsfiddle.net/X2duh/
[18:22:10] <Marnix___> Anyone here that could help me out with the following problem? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13318593/passing-two-arrays-in-a-jquery-post-how-do-i-catch-this-data-in-php-and-use
[18:23:27] <fission6> Marnix___: is this your post?
[18:23:34] <Marnix___> yes
[18:24:49] <fission6> so whats the issue exactly, just stack it here again in short form
[18:25:45] <Marnix___> Well, I know how to include 2 arrays in the .post() request, but I don't know how to then use that data on the PHP side, i wish to form a new array with them combining them
[18:26:08] <Marnix___> its probably really simple
[18:26:14] <Marnix___> but I cant figure it out haha
[18:26:35] <shoky> Marnix___ did you see the latest answer?
[18:26:49] <Marnix___> yes :) going to try that now
[18:28:08] <shoky> it should work
[18:31:03] <Marnix___> yep
[18:31:06] <Marnix___> its resolved now :)
[18:31:10] <Marnix___> cheers!
[18:31:40] <Kythlo> here is my website im working on . https://dl.dropbox.com/u/119504375/Website/index.html .  I have a bridge between as an visual effect before main nav and submenu  where i want it be blended. I need assistance is moving the bridge to location of the navbar selection.
[18:32:07] <Kythlo> Id appreciate some help if someone knows what i am trying to do :S
[18:33:28] <batmanbond3d> I don't understand
[18:33:45] <shoky> me neither
[18:33:51] <shoky> what bridge..
[18:34:18] <shoky> oh
[18:34:44] <Kythlo> sorry where it says slider
[18:35:09] <Kythlo> i want that basically to to overlap the div for the submenu
[18:35:46] <batmanbond3d> to get rid of the blue border?
[18:36:01] <Kythlo> precisely
[18:36:14] <batmanbond3d> you can achieve that with z-index and relative positioning
[18:37:34] <Kythlo> So like z-index:+1;
[18:37:48] <batmanbond3d> you make the selected menu item like left Item have the highest z-index
[18:38:02] <Kythlo> oh
[18:38:02] <batmanbond3d> the sub menu next highest
[18:38:04] <Kythlo> okay
[18:38:14] <batmanbond3d> and the unselected menu itmes next highest
[18:38:17] <Kythlo> in my case the submenu div?
[18:38:25] <batmanbond3d> ya
[18:38:48] <batmanbond3d> then you move the sub menu ontop of the menu
[18:38:58] <Kythlo> okay how do i make it hover relative to to nav menu selection ?
[18:39:06] <batmanbond3d> and the resulting effect will be part of the border isn't displayed
[18:40:20] <batmanbond3d> let me write you up a rough concept
[18:44:05] <raj> can I remove all eventhandlers on a page?
[18:45:35] <batmanbond3d> $('selector').unbind();
[18:45:49] <batmanbond3d> look up unbind
[18:47:11] <batmanbond3d> sorry, I guess $('*').unbind()
[18:47:17] <batmanbond3d> caution, probably very slow
[18:52:38] <Alecoalec> http://jsfiddle.net/Aleco/L9yYb/
[18:52:52] <Alecoalec> How would I make this look nicer? The other images after on click move get scattered everywhere
[18:58:54] <batmanbond3d> by putting non broken links to the images
[19:01:29] <Alecoalec> Lmao
[19:01:40] <Alecoalec> they're not broken batmanbond3d, it's just htaccess block
[19:01:40] <Alecoalec> hold up
[19:02:11] <Alecoalec> All you
[19:15:56] <raj> batmanbond3d, so would it be ridiculous to use $('*').unbind()
[19:15:57] <raj> ?
[19:22:19] <batmanbond3d> how often do you do it?
[19:22:30] <raj> everytime a tab is clicked
[19:22:42] <raj> i'm basically trying to turn my regular site into a SPA site
[19:23:10] <raj> so when one of the tabs is clicked, I just .load() whatever html page
[19:23:14] <batmanbond3d> I would then set up proper destructors
[19:23:55] <raj> basically, unbind each bound event
[19:24:14] <raj> can I put a destruct function in each event?
[19:24:28] <raj> so I call destruct() and it destructs
[19:25:27] <raj> *in each eventhandler
[19:26:59] <batmanbond3d> if you are going for SPA, consider an MVC approach
[19:27:08] <batmanbond3d> check out backbone
[19:27:23] <raj> how would the MVC deal with the eventhandler?
[19:28:33] <batmanbond3d> it would help you organize your event handlers so you don't have so many of them that you are tempted to just unbind all them instead of properly managing them
[19:29:19] <fission6> whats SPA
[19:29:32] <fission6> single page application?
[19:29:39] <raj> yes
[19:29:49] <fission6> have you reviewed angularjs looks decent
[19:29:53] <fission6> been meaning to try it out
[19:29:54] <raj> batmanbond3d, how does organization prevent me from needing to unbind?
[19:30:18] <fission6> you should use a framework like backbone or angular
[19:30:31] <raj> I've looked into them fission6
[19:30:47] <fission6> and
[19:30:53] <raj> but not sure how it helps with the eventhandler situation
[19:31:17] <batmanbond3d> you unbind each event you bound
[19:31:30] <raj> so I can do there here and now as well
[19:31:33] <batmanbond3d> not crawl through the dom and look for events to unbind which could be slow
[19:31:34] <raj> *do that
[19:31:49] <batmanbond3d> yes you can, do it like that
[19:32:18] <batmanbond3d> if you are having problems keeping track you may also be accidentally doubly binding event
[19:32:45] <raj> so I was asking if there's a way to have a `destruct` function in each eventhandler so i can call it and all the eventhandlers with that function can unbind
[19:32:50] <fission6> raj, why are you even discussing all this bind and unbind if your end goal is a SPA
[19:32:58] <fission6> there are frameworks to do just that
[19:33:07] <raj> frameworks that bind and unbind for me?
[19:33:28] <batmanbond3d> no, all it does is help you organize your code really
[19:33:39] <raj> yeah, agreed
[19:33:57] <raj> my code is pretty organized, so don't really need a framework
[19:34:07] <raj> however, my next project will of course just include one probably
[19:34:22] <batmanbond3d> should be easy to look at your code and see where you bind to Dom, and then easy to desctruct and unbind each event individually
[19:35:34] <raj> yeah, but since I'm coding anyway, it would be neat to just have a `destruct()` function to unbind eventhandlers
[19:35:56] <achunin> hello
[19:38:19] <raj> perhaps add the name of the function to some array, and then unbind everything in the array?
[19:38:32] <raj> wait, no, it would have to be the element
[19:40:47] <batmanbond3d> if you are just looking for a shortcut you can still do $('*').unbind()
[19:41:36] <batmanbond3d> you can try it out and see if it is too slow or not
[19:41:58] <raj> you're right, it's ridiculous to crawl through every single element
[19:43:33] <achunin> wondering if anyone has experience animation lag due to a flash object in the DOM
[19:43:57] <batmanbond3d> booo flash
[19:44:28] <achunin> flash ads. :-(
[19:44:43] <achunin> business still loading flash ads.
[19:44:54] <batmanbond3d> did you try in all browsers?
[19:45:00] <achunin> yeah
[19:45:06] <achunin> it affects chrome
[19:45:06] <batmanbond3d> same effect?
[19:45:10] <achunin> yeah
[19:45:20] <achunin> even simple sliders
[19:45:25] <achunin> going left and right
[19:45:32] <achunin> will get choppy
[19:45:38] <achunin> or stop midway
[19:46:42] <achunin> i guess there really isn't much i can do about it, if theres a terrible flash ad takeover
[19:50:38] <batmanbond3d> I don't have much experience with flash so I can't help much
[19:51:10] <achunin> no worries.  just thought i'd toss it out there :-D
[19:51:26] <raj> how can I unbind this? http://paste.ofcode.org/uaNgFABe2NbpFXqHkk7CDE
[19:53:15] <bob__> Hi guys, need alittle help, I have an image tag in a div and two other divs positioned at the top and bottom as caption holders (they overlay the image), when I fade in the image the top div seems to fade out then instantly become fully visible again...
[19:54:52] <achunin> browser / os?
[19:54:57] <bob__> ...which is very odd as the fadeIn has nothing to do with the top div and only applys to the image, this possibly a FF bug as IE displays it correctly but I'm unable to find any info on it
[19:54:58] <b-ot> bob__, definitely being used as one ;)
[19:55:26] <bob__> FF 16.0.2 & XP
[19:57:19] <achunin> pastebin?
[19:58:47] <bob__> Actually maybe it would be better if I did a "jsfiddle" on it and come back later, might be more useful
[19:59:00] <raj> if I do $(document).on('click', '.myelement', handler), can I unbind using $('.myelement').unbind()?
[19:59:25] <achunin> yeah that's be good bob
[19:59:43] <bob__> TTYL if on! thx
[20:06:37] <raj> everyone must be partying tonight
[20:07:28] <thinkerweb> is jquery mobile beta or still alpha/
[20:08:27] <acidjazz> thinkerweb: im trying out kendo
[20:10:51] <raj> any answerers?
[20:11:05] <acidjazz> uhm
[20:11:24] <acidjazz> i would $('.myelement').unbind('click');
[20:11:25] <thinkerweb> acidjazz, cool
[20:11:29] <thinkerweb> How do you autoredirect?
[20:11:52] <acidjazz> even $('.myelement').unbind('click', handler);
[20:11:54] <acidjazz> woudl be better
[20:12:15] <batmanbond3d> try it out and see
[20:12:41] <thinkerweb> if (screen.width <= 699) {document.location = "YOUR-MOBILE-SITE.com"
[20:15:49] <raj> is there any harm in just doing a general .unbind() without the handler?
[20:16:14] <raj> my main concern was not having it written out the same way I put it in, with the selector in the parentheses
[20:16:46] <acidjazz> raj: unbind will unbind everything bound
[20:16:56] <raj> cool
[20:17:03] <raj> thanks
[20:17:06] <acidjazz> raj: so yo ucould mistakenly remove other binds .. so its just best practice to try and only unbind what ou bind
[20:17:07] <acidjazz> np
[20:18:46] <raj> I want to unbind everything though
[20:19:02] <raj> but unbinding `document` won't help in my example above, right?
[20:19:11] <raj> i need the selector?
[20:19:22] <raj> the selector i passed as an argument to .on()
[20:19:46] <raj> like $(document).unbind() won't solve anything
[20:19:47] <raj> ?
[20:20:45] <acidjazz> why are you trying to bind to the entire browser?
