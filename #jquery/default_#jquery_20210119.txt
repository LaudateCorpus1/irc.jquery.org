[06:35:42] <ThoMe> hiho
[06:36:39] <ThoMe> have a div with id "inputFormRow" and in this there divs. I would like after the div with class "input-group-append" add a text
[06:37:16] <ThoMe> i tried this $(this).closest('#inputFormRow').after("test");
[06:37:56] <ThoMe> it works. but "test" inserted after the div with id "inputFormRow". I need this into the div, after the div with the class "input-group-append"
[06:38:06] <ThoMe> can anyone help me please?
[06:42:19] <ThoMe> closest('#inputFormRow').find('.input-group-append').after("test"); works 50%
[06:42:39] <ThoMe> but jquery insert "test" into the divelement from .input-group-append. I would like after this div element
[06:51:10] <Cork> ThoMe: i would strongly recommend using a span and put that element where you want it
[06:51:29] <Cork> you can to some degree insert text, but you can't remove it again unless it is in a dedicated element
[06:52:10] <Cork> also if you want to add into the element you want append not after
[06:58:38] <ThoMe> Cork: all right. and my method is correct with closet and find?
[06:59:09] <Cork> ThoMe: not possible to say from your example
[08:17:40] <OneSploit> Has anyone tried using this https://datatables.net/examples/styling/bootstrap5.html ?? I can't get it to work for some reason
[08:17:59] <OneSploit> I am using pure bootstrap5 in my base template
[13:15:19] <goddard> how can i deal with a function not being seen in html but then also not being usable if declared after another function?
[13:16:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:16:40] <robertmaxrees> goddard might need you to be more specific about what's going on.
[13:17:22] <goddard> i have a callback for a modal for bootstrap 3 it is a function just a normal js function
[13:17:29] <goddard> that function calls another function that is in jquery
[13:17:37] <goddard> but it is defined after my first function
[13:17:41] <goddard> so it doesn't exist
[13:17:54] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code?
[13:18:25] <robertmaxrees> because "that function calls another function that is in jquery" shouldn't matter - it only matters that the function gets called after it loads.
[13:18:33] <robertmaxrees> unless you're doing something really unusual.
