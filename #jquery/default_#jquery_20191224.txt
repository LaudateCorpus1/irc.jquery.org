[14:08:39] <taplar> santa stole all the people with issues
[14:20:41] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:43:52] <grid->     $(document).on("click","#dataTbl td:nth-child(2)",function(){
[15:43:52] <grid->     		alert($(this).text());
[15:43:52] <grid->     });
[15:44:25] <grid-> if i do this how can i alert nth-child(2) in the this?
[15:48:38] <pavonia> What do you mean?
[15:55:55] <grid-> https://jsfiddle.net/e5uscw0h/
[15:56:42] <grid-> when you click on a cell of the second column it will alert the cell data, i need to alert the current cell data (like it already does) and the one of the previous cell
[16:04:19] <grid-> hmm
[16:14:12] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/b0tmaf81/ ?
[16:16:13] <grid-> yes amazing, thanks
[16:17:13] <grid-> how do you get the one before the previous?
[16:17:29] <taplar> you can do prev().prev() if you want, though that can get ugly looking
[16:17:40] <taplar> it would be better if you could put classes on them
[16:17:59] <grid-> $(this).prev is just previous
[16:18:37] <taplar> yes?
[16:18:58] <grid-> is there also an option to display the one before previous?
[16:19:13] <taplar> i just said you can prev().prev()
[16:19:13] <grid-> if the first click was on the 3th row
[16:19:35] <grid-> ooh yes sorry
[16:19:38] <grid-> i missed that
[16:19:43] <taplar> or you're wanting the previously one that was clicked?
[16:19:53] <grid-> nope not waiting :)
[16:20:42] <pavonia> There are also prevAll() and prevUntil() which you can put another selector on
[16:21:11] <pavonia> or .parent().find() etc.
[16:21:35] <taplar> Or go through the datatables api and figure out the methods that will give you the data that it used to construct it's row
[16:21:39] <taplar> rather than navigating the dom
[16:23:11] <grid-> yes, i've read their documentations, but somehow i coundn't really get the click event working on a specific row
[16:23:41] <taplar> you mean you found their api documentation to be confusing?
[16:23:47] <taplar> what are the odds. ^_^
[16:26:47] <grid-> well, to begin, like this example https://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/events_live.html i've tried to debug http://live.datatables.net/wavanizo/1/edit and it wouldn't work, i did look futher on google, to get more specific on a specific row click and that worked
[16:33:17] <grid-> brb
[16:33:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/7x14tq2r/ seems to work
[17:42:09] <grid-> !seen taplar
