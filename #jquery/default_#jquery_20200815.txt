[03:31:36] <diverdude> ()=>{()=>{}}   <--- this is also a closure right?
[03:31:58] <robertmaxrees> wut
[03:41:12] <robertmaxrees> diverdude you can do closures with arrow functions, yes.
[03:41:32] <diverdude> looks convoluted yeah? :)
[03:42:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[03:43:38] <robertmaxrees> your original question is phrased kinda weird imho.
[04:20:52] <diverdude> why
[04:21:09] <robertmaxrees> it isn't specific.
[04:21:20] <diverdude> in what way?
[04:21:25] <robertmaxrees>  ()=>{()=>{}}   <--- this is a function right?
[04:21:33] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually asking?
[04:21:55] <diverdude> if thats also a  closure
[04:22:12] <robertmaxrees> a closure is a function that "closes over" another.
[04:22:20] <robertmaxrees> so sure?
[04:22:26] <diverdude> yeah
[04:22:30] <diverdude> thanks
[04:22:32] <diverdude> :)
[04:22:47] <robertmaxrees> what spurred the question?
[04:23:31] <diverdude> because i have some state that is not updating for some reason so i thought its because its located inside a closure....but i was not 100% if it actually was a closure
[04:23:42] <diverdude> but i can see that it is in fact a closure
[04:24:03] <diverdude> so that might be the reason
[04:24:08] <robertmaxrees> k
