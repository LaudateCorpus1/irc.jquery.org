[01:12:56] <arkore> hello, anyone know of a script that can detect when you are scrolled to either side of screen, and shows arrows that indicate that the screen can be scrolled further to that direction, like on a mobile device that displays a large object that goes beyond the boundries of the device screen.
[01:13:05] <arkore> not sure how to google that.
[01:13:28] <arkore> i could write one, but i figured someone's already done it
[01:14:08] <lordjancso> morning
[01:14:40] <lordjancso> how can i make functions live after dom ready? like fancybox, timeago and other libraries
[01:14:42] <lordjancso> ?
[01:15:04] <lordjancso> is there any elegant solution?
[01:18:37] <arkore> in later versions of jquery, i think .on() replaces .live()  and maybe you can do .on('load', ...) ?
[01:21:44] <arkore> but i'm sure one of the 600 people here may have a better answer.
[01:23:30] <lordjancso> is there on('load', ...) but its not working
[01:28:31] <arkore> hmm, maybe depends what you're doing.
[01:29:15] <arkore> $(document).on('click', '.foo', function() { $(this).fancybox(); });  <div class="foo">...</div>
[01:34:57] <lordjancso> yeah fancybox is ok with click
[01:35:17] <lordjancso> but i'm using jquery.timeago, which is not clickable
[01:35:44] <lordjancso> <time class="timeago" datetime="2014-07-05 09:00:00"></time>
[01:36:05] <lordjancso> and this inserts something like this into the <time> element: "1 hour ago"
[01:40:24] <arkore> hmm, i don't know
[02:05:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know if it's possible to have 1 big element in the center of the screen and let Isotope wrap it's elements around that at all times?
[02:11:06] <uskerine> jquery rocks
[02:16:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm trying to add something to isotope prototype like this: $.Isotope.prototype._masonryReset = function() - but it says $.Isotope is undefined
[02:23:22] <uskerine> 05-Jul-2014 12:31:41.263 SEVERE [http-nio-8084-exec-12] org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve.invoke Servlet.service() for servlet [getInvoiceList] in context with path [/FacturaPyme] threw exception

[02:23:31] <uskerine> what does this actually say?
[03:05:07] <polka> how do i get styles not the computer styles. if i set ele.css('height', 'auto') and when i get it ele.css('height') it gives me computed height in pixels instead of 'auto'. how do i get back actual property value ?
[03:20:32] <arkore> polka, you can't
[03:24:11] <arkore> you'll have to try a hack.  try googling jquery css get height auto hack
[06:02:15] <zth> does anyone know of a good code snippet/"lib" that gets the shortest possible selector for a DOM element in plain text..?
[06:51:09] <cannap> Hi how can i deteted if a element on screen or not
[06:54:54] <decx> cannap get the elements offset to the top of the document and then check if that number is smaller than the scrolled distance + window height on every scroll event
[06:56:14] <cannap> okay thx i try
[06:57:46] <decx> cannap here have a heads up http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Yjg28/
[06:58:20] <cannap> thx :D
[07:15:43] <lordjancso> can somebody recommend me a library which is able to show 1x1, 2x2 and 4x4 elements in a grid which has 4 cols and infinite rows? elements should be able to resizeable to previous sizes (1x1, 2x2 and 4x4), and elements also should be able to drag and drop in grid. so something like isotope or masonry with resize
[07:22:45] <__marco> Good evening, demos.jquerymobile.com seems down
[07:24:16] <__marco> Is there a mirror I can use?
[07:35:45] <ummk> I use this code to get the mouse position then I move a div to that pos. However, currently the x pos seems to work but the y pos places the div maybe 200-300 pixels under the pointer. http://jsbin.com/zoyirepo/1/edit
[07:35:50] <ummk> Can anyone see what is causing this?
[07:36:49] <ummk> ah nvm... had the div inside the wrong container.

[08:22:17] <decx> one look in the sourcecode shows that it's getting that file, anybody who said they tried to help lied
[08:27:10] <phelix> Could someone please help me figure out how to remove the commas from an input field?
[08:29:03] <decx> it's keyCode 188
[08:29:08] <decx> block that on keydown
[08:31:15] <phelix> to remove a comma?
[08:31:43] <decx> well do you want to remove it or do you want to prevent commas from being inputted?
[08:33:06] <phelix> If ya don't mind taking a look. http://jsfiddle.net/PTRMa/3/ and thten look in your console log and on Step 2 the "Vendors Manager's average hourly salary" field just start adding 0's to it and you can see as it gets to where a comma should be the result in the console log goes from 400 to just 4
[08:33:56] <decx> it's the cost calculator fiddle from hell, i've been evading that for 3 months already
[08:34:04] <phelix> lol
[08:34:14] <phelix> i just can't figure out this stupid comma issue
[08:34:35] <phelix> i can't for the life of me figure out how to get that result without it splitting up my number. I can finish this thing if i can get that figured out
[08:36:44] <phelix> this is the last step in getting this thing finished. I  just need to get those as whole numbers so I can add them up. =/ I can't for the life of me figure out why its doing that.
[08:42:45] <decx> get rid of that inputValue thing on line 24
[08:47:11] <phelix> just replace it with what I had commented out? it was duch that had me change it to that
[08:47:36] <phelix> just put it back to inputValue = parseInt($this.val()); ?
[08:48:37] <decx> i did just $this.val()
[08:48:41] <decx> just did
[08:49:03] <decx> no idea what repercussions this have i don't want to read all that code
[08:49:30] <phelix> yeah. I think I need to keep it as inputValue as I need to grab the value from that in another area.
[08:49:59] <phelix> I changed it to this. inputValue = $this.val();
[08:50:30] <phelix> holy crap tha fixed it!
[08:50:30] <phelix> lol
[08:50:32] <phelix> wow
[08:52:07] <phelix> Well thank you soo much! I have been stuck on that stupid issue for like a month
[08:52:26] <decx> well i hope you got paid hourly
[08:53:51] <pawelbx> let's say i have a bunch of images in /path/images/ and i need to load them all dynamically on the fly. the trouble is, i don't actually know the names of the individual images. is there any way i can still load them? i can only use JS
[08:53:52] <phelix> lol, I haven't been working on only this. Mostly other things but it keeps getting put back on my plate.
[08:54:13] <phelix> I know just enough jquery to make a mess.
[08:54:34] <decx> if you don't know the files names then you'r sol

[11:19:30] <brian1001> hi im trying to add sound to a button , and i have this code: http://pastebin.com/9V4Sgm13
[11:19:45] <brian1001> can someone please help me a bit ...
[11:39:52] <Aven3000> thank you morficus
[11:39:55] <Aven3000> http://pastebin.com/DNUMvQZR   My .fadeIn function starts happening AT THE SAME TIME the .fadeOut is happening. Any way to prevent this?
[11:40:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why can't jquery event handlers be placed on SVG tags???
[11:49:02] <decx> they can
[11:51:21] <nCrazed> I have a form that under certain conditions returns a file download (Content-Disposition header) is there any way to catch the download event?
[11:51:59] <Lingo> ecky--ptang-zoob They can, but you've said that you're using a script that turns img tags into svg tags. Are you sure you're img's are already turned into svg's when you're attaching the events?
[11:52:06] <nCrazed> I don't really care about progress or anything else, just that the Content-Disposition response happened
[11:52:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Lingo, I changed it so the event is attached by classname... both img and svg have the class, so it should work right?
[11:53:32] <decx> code plz
[11:54:32] <Lingo> No i don't think so, when you're attaching an event, the element shoud be created already. Maybe the fix will be to use $().delegate() instead of $().on()
[11:56:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> decx: http://pastebin.com/cUZ45hdc
[11:56:48] <decx> and what are you doing in your click function?
[11:56:57] <decx> observe http://jsfiddle.net/decx/vkGjm/
[11:57:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> console.log("ok");
[11:57:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you like it to the path?
[11:57:55] <decx> works the same on the svg for me
[11:58:05] <decx> but path is more exact of course
[11:58:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What is this supposed to be then? http://keith-wood.name/svg.html
[11:59:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> decx: when i put a classname on your svg and select by class name, it breaks: http://jsfiddle.net/vkGjm/1/
[11:59:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I don',t understand why
[11:59:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/vkGjm/1/
[12:00:12] <decx> because $(this).css presumes it's a path
[12:00:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and putting it on the id of the svg doesnt work either http://jsfiddle.net/vkGjm/2/
[12:00:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh
[12:00:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so find("path") should do it?
[12:00:50] <decx> with $(this).find('path') it works
[12:00:52] <decx> yes
[12:01:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yea http://jsfiddle.net/vkGjm/3/
[12:01:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> damn, how can it be
[12:05:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the iconic svg set i'm using has no path
[12:09:51] <decx> ecky--ptang-zoob there are many path in that paste from before
[12:10:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yeah I see now
[12:12:13] <decx> ecky--ptang-zoob i don't know what all the other duplicate thumbs in that pasted svg are for but here's the first one http://jsfiddle.net/decx/2PE8B/
[12:13:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> great... must have made a mistake somewhere
[12:52:26] <juro> hi, I have a problem with a dynamic form pulled into a modal with $.get - I cannot stop the browser from submitting the form ...
[12:53:27] <brian1001> hi, hopefully one of the experts in here knows how to ADD sound when clicking on the button.  i uploaded my code here: http://pastebin.com/qDSYLxrb but no matter what i try , no sound :(
[12:55:30] <juro> brian1001, can you play the sound itself?
[12:55:47] <juro> i.e. directing the browser to the file
[12:56:09] <brian1001> juro: yes
[12:56:32] <juro> brian1001, I doubt that the browser can resolve /var/www/...
[12:57:05] <brian1001> oh yes , its just in the www root , i will remove the "/var/www"
[13:00:47] <decx> brian1001 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/fXfc9/
[13:01:20] <systemfault> Nice prototype :P Wish to never see that in production...

[13:02:04] <brian1001> thank you !
[13:08:54] * AnTi_MTtr wonders why some skrollr demos use background-position and others use transform: translate3d in place of the first
[13:08:57] <AnTi_MTtr> what would the difference between those two be?
[13:12:52] <decx> if you animate a repeating tile then background position is more convenient
[13:14:13] <juro> ok, so here is the basic structure of what I am struggeling with http://jsfiddle.net/7GSFj/1/
[13:16:50] <decx> juro http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:17:06] <juro> decx, checking
[13:17:47] <decx> the form you $.get doesnt exist at pageload when this script is executed, therefore you must delegate it with on() from a static parent
[13:20:02] <juro> decx, from http://api.jquery.com/submit/ "This method is a shortcut for .on( "submit", handler )"
[13:20:38] <juro> or do I need to have a static parent that I put the form in?
[13:21:51] <brian1001> @all: is there any easy way to achieve this just in the PHP file: http://jsfiddle.net/fXfc9/4/
[13:21:51] <b-ot> brian1001: memorised “all:”.
[13:22:00] <decx> yes
[13:22:20] <juro> decx, was that "yes" for me?
[13:22:23] <decx> yes
[13:23:04] <juro> so I need a parent that I attach that to? e.g. $('.parent > form').on('submit', ....
[13:23:51] <decx> $(document).on('submit', 'form', fn...)
[13:24:14] <decx> if you don't ahve a static parent at hand because your modal gets appended dynamically as well
[13:24:34] <juro> ah, ok. that would be easy enough to test .. #lemmeCheck
[13:28:24] <juro> decx, cool, that worked, thank you!
[13:29:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> decx is awesome!
[13:38:23] <brian1001> can someone please look at this code: http://jsfiddle.net/jE948/
[13:40:48] <brian1001> oops sorry i meant : http://jsfiddle.net/jE948/1/
[13:49:12] <OwlFace> Hi, I’m new to learning jquery and I have a question
[13:49:18] <OwlFace> http://jsfiddle.net/PmxXL/1/
[13:49:33] <OwlFace> Is line 9 in this example, basically a for loop ?
[13:49:50] <OwlFace> is it like a for loop in jquery?
[13:51:54] <Hellz2K> OwlFace: yeah, for each item (name the instance i) in data.items do xxx
[13:51:55] <lordjancso> foreach loop
[13:52:23] <OwlFace> this looks different than a normal javascript for loop am i right ?
[13:53:17] <OwlFace> for example, the word for is not present here
[13:54:05] <OwlFace> and last question, in line 10 of this example, is “media.m” a property of each image
[13:54:08] <juro> OwlFace, it basically means "look what is in this parent element and do for every child element"
[13:54:20] <OwlFace> is media.m something in the json that is being pulled?
[13:54:24] <lordjancso> in a for loop you must know the numbers of children, in foreach loop you no need to know
[13:54:36] <OwlFace> oh ok
[13:55:00] <Hellz2K> OwlFace: sure: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1049112/what-is-the-meaning-of-symbol-in-jquery
[13:55:20] <juro> OwlFace, the loop is more similar to the while ... do loop
[13:56:04] <OwlFace> alright, and is media m a property of the json i am reading ?
[13:56:29] <OwlFace> im guessing
[13:56:32] <Hellz2K> sure probsbly described in flickrs api
[13:56:40] <OwlFace> ok
[13:57:33] <juro> OwlFace, yes, it is an attribute/variable of the JSON media object that flickr returns

[17:08:23] <valentinmu> another stupid question :) how can i make button that will rotate image by 90deg every time i click it?
[17:08:34] <valentinmu> $('#current_image').css({'transform': 'rotate(-90deg)'}); rotates it only to position "-90deg"
[17:08:45] <decx> no javascript needed
[17:09:13] <valentinmu> decx: hm?
[17:09:42] <decx> transform on :focus
[17:09:43] <valentinmu> even if i want to do this by click event?
[17:11:23] <decx> probably not ^^
[17:12:35] <valentinmu> anyway, i got another problem
[17:13:28] <valentinmu> when i to that transform - image rotates only once i click. all following clicks have no visible result
[17:14:02] <decx> http://api.jquery.com/one/
[17:15:33] <valentinmu> decx: this is exactly the thing i *dont* need :)))
[17:16:06] <decx> oh that was the problem and not a question
[17:16:07] <decx> ^^
[17:17:06] <decx> well you probably set rotate to 360, after that happens nothing changes if you set it to 360
[17:17:18] <decx> so you have to add 360

[21:14:39] <average> etc. any proper general data compression in js would be nice
[22:59:51] <ZacHarney> Hi, I'm very new to jquery and am developing a website that uses a jquery/js  plugin called blear to blur the background of my sticky header when content scrolls under it like in iOS 7, but while it mostly works with images, when text scrolls under the header, instead of blurring out it stays normal. Text blurs fine on the demo page for the plugin, but just not for me. Demo page here: http://byjaden.github.io/blear/
[23:05:39] <systemfault> I know blur is cool… but do you understand what happens?
[23:06:12] <systemfault> It makes a copy of the entire dom… and blurs it.
[23:06:19] <systemfault> It’s like the worst idea ever.
[23:06:34] <systemfault> Beside perhaps having a blank page written LOL of it.
[23:07:40] <ZacHarney> I know it duplicates the dom. I've altered the code to copy only the content div i want blurred, and it may not end up even going in the final release, but I would still like to try and get the text blurred as well, not just the images.
[23:08:05] <systemfault> It should blur everything :/
[23:08:24] <systemfault> Because that’s what it does… create a div… copy the whole dom in it then blurs the wrapper
[23:09:55] <ZacHarney> In the blear code, it applys the blur to the entire body except the header div, and has the header on a z-index layer higher than the blur layer and it mostly works, it's just not working on text.
[23:10:23] <systemfault> everything happens on that element with the blear-wrap class
[23:10:50] <systemfault> Is your website online or can you reproduce your bug on jsfiddle or something?
[23:11:11] <ZacHarney> I'm uploading to a test site now
[23:26:18] <ZacHarney> sorry it took so long, there are no images uploaded to my test cms so had to hardcode into the template. My site with the blur problem is here: http://zacharney.com/testing/koken/
[23:27:14] <ZacHarney> Just the front page, the links on the page all lead to blank pages
[23:40:07] <systemfault> ZacHarney: I think I found it
[23:40:44] <systemfault> It doesn’t like your transparent background on the <body> at all
[23:47:19] <ZacHarney> The reset.css was applying background:transparent to the body tag, I removed that, but it's still not blurring text.
[23:47:53] <systemfault> Is it removed on your test?
[23:48:44] <systemfault> For fun, add a white background to <main>
[23:48:46] <ZacHarney> yes
[23:48:54] <ZacHarney> hold on
[23:49:02] <systemfault> It fixes it when I do it manually in the inspector
[23:49:31] <ZacHarney> That works. Thanks
[23:49:37] <systemfault> You’re welcome :)
[23:50:19] <ZacHarney> I had a feeling it would be something easy like that, nearly always is, just couldn't figure out what.
[23:50:30] <systemfault> That was a weird bug
[23:53:08] <ZacHarney> Do you know any good free sites or resources for learning jquery and javascript? I understand basic language structure with web languages, just don't yet understand the specific details of each line of code.
[23:53:32] <ZacHarney> Or if not free, then cheap?
