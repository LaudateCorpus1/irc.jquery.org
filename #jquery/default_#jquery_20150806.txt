[00:23:06] <hellyeah> hey
[00:23:11] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[00:23:18] <hellyeah> do you know modal window?
[00:26:55] <SirLagz> hellyeah: there's always people around
[00:28:45] <hellyeah> SirLagz: http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/65/embedded/result/ pls click red button and click image button on the table second modal window will open. And refresh the page. I used localstorage so you see modals open but position of second modal window goes down how can i avoid this
[00:29:32] <SirLagz> hellyeah: no idea.
[00:29:34] <hellyeah> do i need z-index?
[00:29:43] <hellyeah> hmm no problem thank
[00:29:55] <hellyeah> do you know about es6
[00:33:35] <Uhkis> use absolute positioning for the second modal?
[00:33:53] <tash> I want to access the html of a specific <td> in my table. I'm able to console.log the html from every <td> but how can I get the one specific <td>?  none of the <td>'s have id's and not sure if they should or not.
[00:34:01] <tash> http://pastie.org/10332621
[00:34:23] <Uhkis> tash: yes, use id's
[00:34:52] <tash> id on the <td>?
[00:35:12] <tash> in conjunction with .html() ?
[00:35:36] <Uhkis> it's either id or you have to do some :nth-child mess
[00:37:39] <tash> well poo, that was simple!
[00:37:43] <tash> thanks Uhkis :)
[00:37:55] <tash> now I'm going to bed
[00:37:56] <tash> g'night
[00:49:06] <pulpbrittle> I wrote this but it doesn't work: http://dpaste.com/001F29P
[00:49:25] <hellyeah> try jsfiddle
[00:54:03] <Uhkis> pulpbrittle: that event listener doesn't "see" the matches after the function is ran
[01:01:22] <hellyeah> Uhkis:
[01:02:09] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/65/embedded/result/ can you click red button and image button on the table and refresh the page second modal window goes down do you have any idea how to fix http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/65/embedded/result/
[01:04:11] <Uhkis> [10:33] < Uhkis> use absolute positioning for the second modal?
[01:04:34] <pulpbrittle> Uhkis: how about this: https://eval.in/412938
[01:04:48] <pulpbrittle> Uhkis: it works
[01:04:53] <hellyeah> already did
[01:05:08] <pulpbrittle> Uhkis: any idea to make that better?
[01:05:25] <hellyeah> Uhkis: line 212
[01:05:26] <Uhkis> pulpbrittle: that makes no sense
[01:05:42] <pulpbrittle> Uhkis: why?
[01:06:38] <Uhkis> pulpbrittle: because it tries to find checked checkbox by name (which should be unique) and returns an array of max one element
[01:06:57] <pulpbrittle> Uhkis: ok
[01:06:57] <Uhkis> pulpbrittle: what are you trying to do?
[01:07:16] <pulpbrittle> Uhkis: selectedCheckboxQuerySelector or getSelectedCheckbox
[01:08:11] <Uhkis> pulpbrittle: that does not answer my question
[01:08:43] <Duikb00t> jo
[01:08:44] <pulpbrittle> Uhkis: nevermind I just try that
[01:09:06] <pulpbrittle> Uhkis: that'll be this https://eval.in/412939
[01:17:40] <pulpbrittle> Uhkis: I want to get all selected check-boxes and POST them to server-side
[01:27:32] <Uhkis> pulpbrittle: why aren't you just doing the check on server side..
[01:32:30] <pulpbrittle> Uhkis: We using flask micro-framework
[01:32:45] <pulpbrittle> I mean Python
[01:33:00] <Uhkis> and?
[01:33:16] <Uhkis> i'm sure it's capable of simple check like that
[01:49:21] <sonda> hello
[01:49:55] <sonda> is it possible to hide the parent <ul> elements while displaying child <li> elements
[01:50:58] <p2sk> no
[01:51:45] <sonda> i have a tree view
[01:51:58] <sonda> i want to give search functionality
[01:52:17] <sonda> only the node and its children should be shown for the matched node
[01:52:30] <sonda> how can it be done
[01:58:20] <gtr> Hello world
[01:58:56] <arup_r> I am trying to trigger a event on keypress, but it is not working, as the inside the console.log(1); not priniting any thing at all https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/aa1f2374bf915f48f493
[02:00:58] <gtr> I wonder if it's possible to set a handler on a child
[02:01:23] <gtr> I tried it this way (http://jsfiddle.net/tsbhct0p/) but it did not work :'(
[02:01:41] <gtr> Any help would be appreciated
[02:01:43] <sonda> p2sk: why its not possible
[02:02:23] <Uhkis> arup_r: nothing wrong with that
[02:04:49] <p2sk> sonda: because it is no valid markup
[02:05:14] <sonda> then how do we filter a tree
[02:05:23] <sonda> show only a part
[02:05:38] <sonda> create a altogether new view
[02:05:44] <Uhkis> gtr: i'm afraid you have to do them one by one
[02:05:51] <p2sk> hide the uls u dont want do show and show the ul u want to be displayed
[02:05:52] <sonda> ??
[02:07:24] <sonda> like if in any of its children the pattern matches i need to display that ul right?
[02:07:48] <gtr> alright, it's what I though. Thank you Uhkis
[02:09:24] <p2sk> yes
[02:10:46] <p2sk> and its parents uls based on the depth of your tree
[02:11:25] <sonda> its a nested tree... the matched <ul> may have parent <ul> , which i don't want to show
[02:17:58] <p2sk> sonda: lets use a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/yhth0awk/
[02:20:00] <p2sk> sonda: http://jsfiddle.net/yhth0awk/1/
[02:20:47] <p2sk> with display:none you can see how the list will behave when you want to hide an element
[02:23:50] <arup_r> Uhkis: I binded it with $(document) {... and it worked
[02:23:57] <arup_r> no idea what was the issue
[02:29:30] <sonda> yeah .., we have to show all parents
[02:30:02] <Uhkis> arup_r: you didn't focus the element before typing..?
[02:38:38] <p2sk> sonda: or copy your last found ul elsewhere
[02:58:58] <MagePsycho_> which is the best jQuery slider for web + mobile?
[03:04:56] <Lebbe> just putting the content in a .html works
[03:05:25] <Lebbe> most browsers have scrolling implemented by themself
[03:13:41] <arup_r> Uhkis: means ?
[03:16:26] <arup_r> I have a input field, I want to trigger a event when field value someone completely cleared
[03:44:51] <`ULT> hello, i get an error in this: console.log($('input[name=option45:checked', '.options').val());
[03:46:21] <`ULT> Sizzle.error = function( msg ) {
[03:46:21] <`ULT> 	throw new Error( "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: " + msg );
[03:46:21] <`ULT> };
[03:51:59] <p2sk> `ULT: :checked is a selector and not a name and your attribute check should close. $("input[name='option45'] :checked, .options").val()
[03:59:40] <hellyeah> hey
[04:01:35] <hellyeah> can you click image button on the table and refresh the page. Second window goes down? Any idea how can i fixe? http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/85/embedded/result/
[04:03:16] <Kartagis> why would http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/pn62kmfg/ think I'm doing GET?
[04:03:35] <Kartagis> bruncol is a spammer btw
[04:09:58] <prohobo> Kartagis: wrong keyword
[04:10:01] <prohobo> http://jsfiddle.net/pn62kmfg/1/
[04:10:07] <prohobo> its "type" not "method"
[04:10:16] <acidjazz> bruncol is a WATCH WE MUST BURN HER AND CLEANSE OURSELVES
[04:10:32] <acidjazz> I RECON NEXT TIME BRUNCOL ENTERS WE DECLARE PURGE AND LEGALLY DEAL WITH THE WIDTH
[04:10:42] <prohobo> bruncol has been spamming in pm for the past week and no one cares
[04:10:45] <prohobo> good for him
[04:11:04] <acidjazz> I REQUIRE OPS
[04:11:16] <taplar> you -desire- ops
[04:11:36] <acidjazz> it is a missing ingredient
[04:11:39] <acidjazz> of justifce
[04:14:42] <Kartagis> uhm
[04:14:47] <Kartagis> okay
[04:16:44] <prohobo> Kartagis: /
[04:16:45] <prohobo> ?
[04:16:59] <Kartagis> thanks prohobo
[04:18:58] <hellyeah> prohobo: pls halp
[04:19:58] <Kartagis> prohobo: oh, method is for jq 1.9.0+
[04:20:07] <Kartagis> before that, type
[04:20:18] <Kartagis> missed that
[04:20:39] <prohobo> hellyeah: wut
[04:22:20] <hellyeah> prohobo: click image button opn the table you will see modal window on the top and refresh the page it goes down little bit. Any idea how can i fix http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/89/embedded/result/
[04:23:22] <prohobo> dude
[04:23:34] <prohobo> that is way too complex and poorly organized
[04:23:39] <prohobo> why do you have 3 black dots
[04:23:42] <prohobo> whats the face for
[04:23:55] <prohobo> why does the titlebar extend beyond the window
[04:24:00] <prohobo> why does it open on refresh?
[04:24:25] <prohobo> i cant figure out what's supposed to be happening
[04:24:29] <prohobo> vs what is happening
[04:24:32] <taplar> the open on refresh is him trying to preserve page state and protect against f5
[04:25:00] <prohobo> i see
[04:25:29] <prohobo> when i close it and try to open it again, it wont open
[04:25:33] <hellyeah> black dots is counter
[04:25:37] <hellyeah> there is number in it
[04:25:45] <prohobo> and everytime i f5 the window is in the same position
[04:25:49] <prohobo> so that seems fine?
[04:26:01] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/91/
[04:26:16] <hellyeah> face with question is to give information about system
[04:26:22] <`ULTfood> p2sk, thanks. but i have the code from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/596351/how-can-i-know-which-radio-button-is-selected-via-jquery
[04:26:35] <prohobo> then it seems to work fine for me in chrome
[04:26:52] <hellyeah> title bar extend window i dont understand that part
[04:26:57] <`ULTfood> aah i see the mistake
[04:27:17] <hellyeah> prohobo: it didnt go down
[04:27:18] <`ULTfood> didnt close the attribute indeed like you sayed
[04:27:26] <hellyeah> you see on the top after refresh?
[04:27:30] <prohobo> yeah
[04:27:38] <prohobo> it doesnt move
[04:27:46] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:28:15] <hellyeah> it moves here
[04:28:19] <hellyeah> i dont understand
[04:29:08] <prohobo> chrome?
[04:29:40] <MagePsycho_> which is the best jQuery slider for web + mobile?
[04:29:40] <hellyeah> yes
[04:30:03] <prohobo> MagePsycho_: jquery ui
[04:30:06] <hellyeah> chrome  44.0.2403.130
[04:30:29] <prohobo> same version
[04:31:30] <hellyeah> taplar: d you have time little bit? Can you check it kindly ask
[04:31:52] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/85/embedded/result/
[04:31:58] <taplar> i'm looking.  are you opening one of the things by default now?
[04:32:17] <hellyeah> no default
[04:32:31] <hellyeah> normally you click red button and you click image button
[04:32:50] <hellyeah> when you refresdsh it moves when you close second dialog box it stays closed
[04:39:31] <Duikb00t> taplar YO :D
[04:39:47] <taplar> sup
[04:40:03] <Duikb00t> How you doing?
[04:40:09] <hellyeah> prohobo: why is it poorly organized? btw
[04:40:27] <marienz> this is a test of the bot detection system. Please disregard this test.
[04:40:35] <hellyeah> taplar: does it move on your side or doesnt move after refreshimg
[04:40:46] <hellyeah> marienz: are you bot
[04:40:50] <hellyeah> :XD
[04:40:51] <taplar> ok, trying to check out a positioning problem at the moment, :)
[04:41:00] <hellyeah> thank you taplar
[04:41:00] <marienz> hellyeah: I can see why you might think so, but no
[04:45:07] <Duikb00t> taplar my image is still bugging me :D
[04:50:17] <`ULTfood> hello, this is my HTML: <input type="radio" name="option[45]"
[04:50:26] <`ULTfood> by selecting this, $('input[name=option[45]] is conflicting
[04:50:57] <`ULTfood> can I work around this problem?
[04:51:44] <taplar> hellyeah: not sure of the fix, but it looks like the issue is something to do with the page displaying popup1 while displaying popup2.  popup1 is affecting the page dimensions so is probably why popup2 is being skewed in its placement
[04:52:31] <taplar> `ULTfood: don't put brackets in your names, :P
[04:53:56] <taplar> otherwise if it's out of your control, you have to escape the [] in the selector
[04:54:01] <taplar> they're special characters
[04:54:10] <`ULTfood> aah haha thx
[04:54:15] <`ULTfood> i can escape with / ?
[04:54:18] <taplar> \
[04:54:24] <`ULTfood> thanks, i will trie!
[04:54:32] <hellyeah> taplar: any idea what i can do
[04:54:37] <MagePsycho_> has anyone used owlslider?
[04:54:43] <`ULTfood> $('input[name=option\[45\]]
[04:54:51] <`ULTfood> such as this taplar
[04:54:57] <`ULTfood> it`s indeed out of my control.
[04:54:59] <taplar> i'd think so
[04:55:24] <taplar> i believe it's suggested to surround your value with quotes though
[04:55:45] <samssh> `ULTfood, Can you select by ID instead? That would be even better.
[04:55:56] <taplar> 'input[name="option\[45\]"]'
[04:57:00] <`ULTfood> hi samssh, by id is not posible
[04:57:20] <`ULTfood> every input has a uniq id
[04:57:42] <`ULTfood> i can maybe add a class
[04:58:20] <hellyeah> taplar: when you close animation position wont change
[04:58:26] <hellyeah> everything works smooth
[04:58:26] <taplar> Duikb00t: btw, i was thinking about your issue yesterday.  since it's primarily a css issue, you'd probably be better asking #css.  probably more people there will better skillz than i
[04:58:36] <Duikb00t> :D
[04:59:12] <taplar> hellyeah: when you are doing the operations your doing them one at a time
[04:59:22] <taplar> on your restore your doing multiple potentially
[04:59:48] <Uhkis> `ULTfood: <input type="radio" name="option[45]"
[04:59:51] <taplar> to illustrate, you can put your restore for button 2 in a timeout of 2000 and it will reopen properly
[05:00:03] <hellyeah> taplar:  seems make sense
[05:00:18] <Uhkis> `ULTfood: oops, failpaste. $('input[name="option[45]"]') works fine and is cleaner solution
[05:00:43] <taplar> huh
[05:00:49] <taplar> so the "" forces a literal?
[05:04:00] <hellyeah> YamakasY:
[05:04:04] <hellyeah> ops
[05:04:37] <`ULTfood> Uhkis
[05:04:39] <`ULTfood> working :)
[05:04:40] <`ULTfood> thanks!
[05:05:12] <`ULTfood> so with the " " you can escape
[05:11:20] <hellyeah> taplar: can you take a look can you take a look 80-144 http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/93/
[05:11:24] <hellyeah> sorry
[05:11:26] <hellyeah> :XD
[05:12:17] <hellyeah> is that what you meant?
[05:13:49] <taplar> what did you change?
[05:13:58] <taplar> 80-144 is a big bit of code
[05:14:02] <hellyeah> i added setTimeout
[05:14:17] <hellyeah> setTimeout(....),2000;
[05:14:25] <hellyeah> actually i add just two line
[05:14:30] <hellyeah> in 80 and 144
[05:14:40] <hellyeah> you dont have to look whole function
[05:14:56] <taplar> i don't see a timeout
[05:15:14] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:15:26] <gurke_> `live
[05:15:28] <gurke_> hmm
[05:15:49] <hellyeah> taplar: in line 80 http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/96/
[05:15:50] <gurke_> gurke_, Always provide a link to a *live* page or pared-down testcase so we can see the problem in action. Looking at code or images alone usually isn't very effective. Also see `paste and `testcase.
[05:16:04] <gurke_> you see dat pared-down testcase?
[05:16:04] <taplar> you linked /93 -_-
[05:16:13] <hellyeah> sorry
[05:16:22] <hellyeah> just forgot to update
[05:16:59] <taplar> no, that's an improper use of setTimeout
[05:17:12] <hellyeah> what does improrer use mean?
[05:17:14] <taplar> what i was talking about was setting a time out on the restore
[05:17:23] <hellyeah> humm
[05:17:31] <taplar> improper, the inverse of proper
[05:19:31] <hellyeah> taplar: actually i dont havew any idea about setting time out on restore may be i can find on google with that hase
[05:19:35] <hellyeah> phase
[05:19:43] <hellyeah> timeout on the restore
[05:20:06] <taplar> your restoring your popup1 and popup2
[05:20:18] <taplar> popup1 is affecting your page dimensions
[05:20:54] <taplar> until you figure out how to make the restoration of popup2 wait on popup1 to stop, you can set a timeout on the restore of popup2 to see that it does fix it and is the issue
[05:21:02] <hellyeah> yes
[05:21:05] <taplar> setTimeout(function, timeoutvalue)
[05:21:27] <hellyeah> hmm let me try smt
[05:21:28] <gurke_> hellyeah,
[05:21:32] <hellyeah> gurke_: sup
[05:21:38] <gurke_> hellyeah, Always provide a link to a *live* page or pared-down testcase so we can see the problem in action. Looking at code or images alone usually isn't very effective. Also see `paste and `testcase.
[05:22:37] <Uhkis> gurke_ pasting stuff from bot? :D
[05:22:37] <hellyeah> i plan to buy domain for development
[05:22:49] <gurke_> Uhkis, yes :D
[05:23:04] <gurke_> hellyeah thats not the reason of that text
[05:23:23] <gurke_> you should prepare just the stuff you have problem with.
[05:23:33] <gurke_> not the whole stuff
[05:23:53] <gurke_> if its getting too much its hard to understand your code
[05:24:27] <hellyeah> gurke_: ic
[05:24:38] <hellyeah> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/97/ do you mean this? line 104
[05:24:50] <hellyeah> or it is improrer again
[05:24:50] <gurke_> you see but keep doing it since 2 weeks
[05:25:26] <taplar> your trying to set a timeout on your binding, not your restoration
[05:25:34] <hellyeah> ic
[05:25:41] <taplar> your restoration is close to the bottom
[05:25:47] <gurke_> at beginning i was willing to help you, but i have not the time to check all your code
[05:25:48] <taplar> where your doing the localStorage checks
[05:26:07] <hellyeah> ops
[05:26:16] <hellyeah> yeah thats that i will say
[05:26:23] <hellyeah> like delaying if checks
[05:26:44] <taplar> also, there are many free options to choose from for preliminary development of sites, such as openshift
[05:26:47] <hellyeah> gurke_: sorry i am kinda newbie
[05:27:22] <hellyeah> i will check that
[05:27:24] <gurke_> hellyeah, try to limit the code of your problem
[05:27:28] <hellyeah> taplar: can i delay code block
[05:27:47] <taplar> for now your just wanting to delay restoring popup2
[05:28:12] <hellyeah> gurke_: http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/89/
[05:28:40] <hellyeah> taplar: i can delay localStorage.getItem
[05:28:42] <hellyeah> ?
[05:28:48] <taplar> why?
[05:29:24] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:29:35] <hellyeah> in getItem line we assign the value
[05:29:39] <taplar> there's logic to know if you should restore, and then there is logic that does the restore
[05:29:41] <hellyeah> but thats not restoration
[05:29:50] <hellyeah> we need to delat the checkState
[05:30:00] <hellyeah> delay*
[05:30:06] <taplar> both popup1 and 2 are in checkState
[05:30:36] <hellyeah> yeah thats another issue
[05:30:44] <hellyeah> i can seperate the function
[05:30:48] <taplar> why?
[05:31:00] <hellyeah> hmm to write this if checks seperately
[05:31:07] <taplar> they are separate
[05:31:12] <taplar> in their own if blocks
[05:31:23] <taplar> that's logic to know if you should restore
[05:34:59] <hellyeah> taplar: sorry
[05:35:06] <hellyeah> i have problem in my stomach
[05:35:14] <hellyeah> i needed go wc :D
[05:35:17] <hellyeah> well
[05:35:30] <hellyeah> i dont know i can get if inside setTimeout
[05:35:39] <hellyeah> i can delay the checks
[05:35:41] <hellyeah> or
[05:36:01] <hellyeah> dont need delat the check
[05:36:31] <hellyeah> just trigger line
[05:36:40] <taplar> exactly
[05:37:39] <theBeginner84> hi all
[05:39:10] <taplar> hey
[05:39:13] <hellyeah> taplar: can you check 172 there is an error expected function? http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/100/
[05:39:22] <theBeginner84> i got a little problem with my jquery script everything works  except that my click event some kind of blocks or not reacts sometime. could someone take a look what could be wrong on it? i prepared it and uploaded everything in jsfiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/qadzL5o5/1/  thanks in advance
[05:41:11] <taplar> hellyeah: setTimeout(Function, Number);
[05:42:09] <taplar> click() is not a function.  it's a function invocation
[05:42:31] <hellyeah> function invocation?
[05:42:39] <hellyeah> what does that term mean?
[05:42:42] <taplar> function me() {} <-- function
[05:42:44] <hellyeah> click is an event
[05:42:52] <taplar> me(); <-- invocation
[05:42:58] <hellyeah> ic
[05:43:51] <hellyeah> so http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/101/
[05:44:11] <YamakasY> hellyeah: now you pinged me, you need to beer all!
[05:44:33] <taplar> does that match the parameters setTimeout is looking for?
[05:44:37] <theBeginner84> if someone got time to loo at my code https://jsfiddle.net/qadzL5o5/1/  everything works except that the click event needs 2 clicks sometime any solution maybe?
[05:45:09] <hellyeah> !beer
[05:45:12] <hellyeah> .beer
[05:45:36] <hellyeah> taplar: setTimeout(Function, number)
[05:45:41] <hellyeah> 200 is a number
[05:45:51] <taplar> yeah
[05:45:53] <hellyeah> but trigger() is function invacation
[05:45:57] <taplar> yes
[05:46:09] <hellyeah> so we need anynomous function may be
[05:46:17] <taplar> go for it
[05:46:23] <hellyeah> function(){...},2000
[05:46:53] <taplar> theBeginner84: i can't seem to get your fiddle to work at all
[05:47:12] <theBeginner84> uhm?
[05:47:16] <theBeginner84> for me it works
[05:49:06] <hellyeah> taplar: kinda newbie on that usage line 172
[05:49:08] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/103/
[05:49:37] <taplar> theBeginner84: that's weird.  cause it doesn't look like any of your slides have parents.  other than body, of which there would only be one
[05:50:18] <taplar> hellyeah: .....
[05:50:37] <taplar> what's the point of making an anonymous function if your immediately invoke it...
[05:50:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:51:09] <taplar> you give setTimeout the function, IT invokes it after the time
[05:51:48] <hellyeah> yes
[05:51:56] <theBeginner84> dont you see on the right side everything when u click on the H2/h3?
[05:51:59] <hellyeah> i dont know usage about anynomous function much
[05:52:22] <taplar> theBeginner84: nope
[05:52:47] <taplar> an anonymous function is just like a regular function, just unnammed
[05:52:59] <taplar> unnamed
[05:53:58] <hellyeah> yes
[05:54:03] <hellyeah> i know like that
[05:54:22] <hellyeah> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/104/
[05:56:17] <taplar> does it work?
[05:56:41] <taplar> you don't have to ask me.  fiddle will let you know if something is still wrong
[05:57:25] <hellyeah> yah
[05:57:32] <hellyeah> well
[05:57:41] <hellyeah> you are SUPERMAN !!!!
[05:57:44] <p2sk> theBeginner84: https://jsfiddle.net/qadzL5o5/3/
[05:57:53] <hellyeah> i need to practice
[05:58:02] <hellyeah> this web thing is new world for me
[05:58:08] <hellyeah> my ideas are limited
[05:58:17] <hellyeah> taplar: thank you so much
[05:58:27] <taplar> hellyeah: the best thing you can do is just try things
[05:59:14] <taplar> p2sk theBeginner84 that one works for me
[05:59:24] <hellyeah> i am just trying
[06:00:05] <taplar> theBeginner84: two things though you might store $('.slides') and $(this) in variables since you use them over and over
[06:00:24] <hellyeah> taplar: you are really cool hope one day i can be like you in jquery
[06:00:34] <hellyeah> taplar: and probably you are reallly smart
[06:00:44] <taplar> i've just been doing js a lot longer than you
[06:01:14] <`ULTfood> taplar, what is your profession?
[06:01:18] <`ULTfood> just wondering
[06:01:35] <taplar> they label me developer/systems analyst
[06:01:50] <`ULT> aah nice, for a company?
[06:01:54] <`ULT> or for your self?
[06:02:15] <notchris> Is there sort of a “general size” that your js files should be aroun
[06:02:18] <taplar> yeah, not a tech company but we do develop their internal applications, and some groups develop their website
[06:02:19] <notchris> Or does it all depend
[06:02:31] <taplar> notchris: all depends on who you ask
[06:02:42] <notchris> taplar: Gotcha
[06:02:58] <Uhkis> manageable is a good size ;-)
[06:03:23] <taplar> notchris: just go for readability.  and a plus would be to segregate based on responsibilities if possible
[06:04:00] <hellyeah> brb
[06:04:00] <taplar> helps to find crap faster
[06:04:35] <p2sk> notchris: if you think your js files are too big you can minify them or split them into smaller parts
[06:05:12] <notchris> True, they are not, I was just curious the count (by line) average of most js files
[06:05:17] <notchris> probably no avg
[06:05:58] <p2sk> you want to solve problems not reach a minimum of lines. it needs as much as it needs
[06:06:22] <taplar> and even if you broke it up into multiple files, all the files would still have to be included on the page
[06:07:19] <notchris> I know it all depends but like “20 lines” of javascript isnt a whole lot
[06:07:23] <notchris> Right?
[06:07:38] <taplar> i don't think so, but tha's opinion
[06:08:17] <p2sk> jquery ~10k lines
[06:08:27] <p2sk> for 1.11.3
[06:08:32] <taplar> but then again, that's relative
[06:08:37] <taplar> what do those 20 lines do?
[06:08:49] <taplar> maybe it is a whole lot for what your trying to do
[06:09:13] <p2sk> infinity ajax calls ^^
[06:18:59] <theBeginner84> p2sk you change the second effect too when 1 item opens all the others need to close
[06:19:25] <p2sk> sec
[06:25:56] <taplar> mmmm, bacon
[06:28:06] <p2sk> theBeginner84: https://jsfiddle.net/qadzL5o5/4/
[06:28:55] <theBeginner84> thanks was it alot to change
[06:32:02] <taplar> oooh, i feel like playing
[06:34:37] <alaing> Hi , i'm using jquery to get loads of elements values to sum their value
[06:34:54] <alaing> now when an element is a td i get this "                         £80.00"
[06:34:56] <taplar> boom!
[06:35:01] <alaing> with the spacing
[06:35:31] <alaing> I want to remove ',', '£' and spaces
[06:35:51] <taplar> theBeginner84: https://jsfiddle.net/qadzL5o5/5/  doesn't slide right now, but it is using the css to show and hide, :)
[06:36:55] <taplar> never used the sibling operator in css before
[06:37:18] <taplar> alaing: look at replace()
[06:37:39] <taplar> regular js function
[06:37:57] <alaing> taplar: yip i've been looking at that
[06:38:19] <alaing> butnot sure how to get the regexp string to replace the values
[06:38:47] <taplar> regex /[ £]/g i would think
[06:39:53] <taplar> yeah
[06:40:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jmtuhkwp/
[06:45:13] <taplar> i left out comma but thats a small change
[06:46:44] <taplar> or https://jsfiddle.net/jmtuhkwp/1/ which would remove everything but numbers and decimal
[06:46:58] <taplar> which is a little better in this case, whitelisting instead of blacklisting
[06:52:50] <DarsVaeda> how do I lazy load an iframe properly? http://jsfiddle.net/wc71mdsk/
[06:53:16] <DarsVaeda> it loads but then it does not replace the div, also appending it to the body seems odd
[06:59:24] <tocka> hi guys maybe anyone has any tips how could i optimise this script? http://jsfiddle.net/xnuymhtz/26/
[07:01:01] <taplar> DarsVaeda: your container is creating a new div, not looking up the one that is on the page
[07:01:35] <DarsVaeda> ah sorry sloppy... http://jsfiddle.net/wc71mdsk/1
[07:04:21] <DarsVaeda> now it loads but gets removed immediately
[07:09:00] <taplar> DarsVaeda: http://jsfiddle.net/wc71mdsk/2/
[07:09:08] <taplar> i remove the replace part
[07:09:16] <taplar> since the iframe is already on the page
[07:09:28] <hellyeah> heyu
[07:09:42] <hellyeah> do i need help one more time ::XD
[07:10:06] <hellyeah> one modal window close another modal window. It didnt happen before can you take a look http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/117/
[07:10:08] <DarsVaeda> taplar, yeah but it should replace that element
[07:10:16] <DarsVaeda> shouldn't just appear anywhere
[07:11:58] <Sal> is there a way to know what parent div is the one used by a child with position absolute?
[07:12:34] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/wc71mdsk/3/ this works but just as long as the parent will just contain the iframe forever :/
[07:12:59] <BinaryKitten> define "used" Sal
[07:14:04] <Sal> an absolute div, is aligned inside the first paf its parents that has a relative/absolute position
[07:14:06] <Sal> right?
[07:14:15] <Sal> pao=of
[07:14:22] <Sal> paf=of
[07:15:00] <taplar> position absolute does not change an elements parent
[07:15:12] <taplar> just how it displays
[07:15:19] <Sal> no, waut
[07:15:37] <Sal> if the parent of a div:absolute is a div:static
[07:16:11] <Sal> then the div:absolute will have its top-left position in another parent div
[07:16:29] <Sal> yes, yes
[07:16:32] <Sal> i know that
[07:16:34] <taplar> 'parent' is misleading there
[07:16:48] <taplar> it can appear over/in another element yes
[07:17:00] <Sal> i just need to find a way to find which div is givinf the top-left origin to the div:absolute
[07:17:09] <BinaryKitten> Sal $(item).parents().filter(function() { return $(this).css('display') === 'yourchoice'; }).eq(0)
[07:17:21] <BinaryKitten> sorry
[07:17:32] <BinaryKitten> change 'display' to 'position'
[07:17:42] <Sal> let me try, thanks
[07:18:19] <taplar> you can also right click on the element and inspect it, then you can click upwards through the parents, examining the css it shows for the elements to see what they are doing
[07:20:25] <`ULT> hello, how can i achive something like this?  $("tr").data(product_id='319').show()
[07:20:40] <`ULT> show the row with data-product_id = 319
[07:21:16] <hellyeah> taplar: little bit help :xd
[07:21:24] <BinaryKitten> is the data in .data OR an attribute with data-
[07:21:33] <hellyeah> data
[07:21:37] <`ULT> attribute with data-
[07:21:53] <hellyeah> attribute with data doesnt change dom i guess
[07:22:03] <BinaryKitten> $('tr[data-product_id="319"]').show();
[07:22:44] <`ULT> working, thank you.
[07:22:49] <`ULT> no to figure out why :p
[07:22:59] <BinaryKitten> why what?
[07:23:09] <`ULT> why your`s is working and not mine
[07:23:20] <taplar> data() gets a value, not a filter
[07:23:23] <`ULT> so data in atribute
[07:23:24] <BinaryKitten> .data isn't for finding attrbutes
[07:23:30] <`ULT> aah oke, one moment
[07:23:45] <BinaryKitten> data-xxx attribute mapping is a nice passthrough but doesn't work both ways
[07:24:14] <BinaryKitten> eg item.data('blob', 'messy') would not set data-blob="messy" on the attributes
[07:24:26] <BinaryKitten> but it would set it in the "data store"
[07:24:43] <taplar> hellyeah: what's your issue?
[07:24:46] <BinaryKitten> the [attrib=value] = selector to find that
[07:25:19] <`ULT> oke thanks. :)
[07:25:22] <`ULT> i was reading on the api
[07:25:47] <BinaryKitten> :D yep. remember most of the functions are not any use until you've selected items
[07:26:02] <`ULT> and i found this: As of jQuery 1.4.3 HTML 5 data- attributes will be automatically pulled in to jQuery's data object.
[07:26:08] <hellyeah> taplar: i open one modal and wehen i open another modal. It close modal perviousl yopened http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/114/embedded/result/ you may have an idea
[07:26:44] <BinaryKitten> `ULT yep, pulled in but not updated
[07:26:52] <BinaryKitten> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[07:26:58] <BinaryKitten> (for the list of selectors)
[07:27:00] <`ULT> right, thanks!
[07:27:05] <`ULT> haha, alot work to do :p
[07:27:24] <BinaryKitten> np
[07:27:50] <BinaryKitten> at least you're trying the right concepts
[07:28:02] <BinaryKitten> i've seen people try to do that using classes
[07:28:48] <BinaryKitten> <tr class="product-319"> and want to find that product is easy.. but getting all product rows isn't
[07:29:20] <hellyeah> taplar: normally it shouldnt close each other.
[07:29:38] <taplar> hellyeah: you only have one popup2 element
[07:30:14] <hellyeah> yes?
[07:30:22] <taplar> yes
[07:30:34] <hellyeah> i have  #popup2
[07:30:40] <hellyeah> do you mean that?
[07:30:43] <taplar> yes
[07:30:43] <Abhijit> how can I set default value of <select> on each page load? if I click outside of dropdown and reload it shows correct default. but if i select any option and then reload then it just shows that selected option.
[07:31:05] <hellyeah> is there anything wrong here? i didnt see the point
[07:31:09] <taplar> Abhijit: you could set it back to default on the initial load of the page
[07:31:47] <taplar> popup2 is one element on the page
[07:31:55] <taplar> your changing it each time you open something
[07:33:12] <Abhijit> taplar, $("id").selected("selected")?
[07:33:16] <hellyeah> when i open boxContainer, popup2 is closed
[07:33:30] <hellyeah> because i am changing popup2 everytime
[07:33:33] <hellyeah> i dont get it
[07:33:59] <taplar> Abhijit: set the val()
[07:34:01] <`ULT> BinaryKitten: I need to show three rows (and underlying row) and I have now this:
[07:34:04] <`ULT>  $('tr[data-product_id="319"], tr[data-product_id="320"], tr[data-product_id="321"]').show().next().show();
[07:34:14] <`ULT> It is working, but is there a shorter (quicker) way?
[07:34:25] <Abhijit> taplar, ok
[07:34:35] <BinaryKitten> `ULT do they have a class on them?
[07:34:45] <`ULT> no, no classes.
[07:34:45] <BinaryKitten> like productRow or such?
[07:34:55] <taplar> `ULT: something like that would be easier as a filter
[07:35:08] <`ULT> oke taplar
[07:35:14] <`ULT> so filter on 319, 320 and 321
[07:35:36] <taplar> $('tr').filter(function(){  return $(this).data('product_id') in ['319', '320', '321']});
[07:35:44] <taplar> something like that
[07:36:14] <BinaryKitten> if you did `ULT then you could do $('.productRow').filter(function() { return $.inArray($(this).data('product_id'), [319,320,321]); });
[07:36:24] <`ULT> i will study that
[07:36:27] <`ULT> thanks guy`s!
[07:36:30] <BinaryKitten> ^5 taplar
[07:36:41] <hellyeah> fixerd
[07:36:41] <taplar> hmm?
[07:36:49] <BinaryKitten> hi 5
[07:36:57] <taplar> ha, lol, thought so but checkin
[07:39:15] <morphyeys> have a nice evening guys!
[07:39:17] <`ULT> inArray is the same as in?
[07:44:17] <taplar> seems right
[07:45:14] <taplar> hmm, maybe not, *playing on fiddle*
[07:45:28] <PilotBob> hi all.
[07:46:31] <PilotBob> I need a hint on how to write a selector that will select all the tr's that have a  td.rowdelete which contains a checkbox that is checked?
[07:47:18] <taplar> apparently not
[07:47:59] <taplar> in appears to work with object and arrays, but in the case of array only if your using a number
[07:48:18] <taplar> so you'd need to do inArray
[07:48:33] <`ULT> hi taplar, i tried yours and the one from BinaryKitten, yours is not wokrking, and the one from BinaryKitten is showing 2 rows instead of 3
[07:48:34] <`ULT> :p
[07:49:04] <BinaryKitten> `ULT can you put your code onto jsfiddle?
[07:49:10] <BinaryKitten> html/js
[07:49:23] <`ULT> sure
[07:49:33] <BinaryKitten> that way we can actually help, rather than just random in-dark pokings
[07:50:22] <taplar> PilotBob: what have you tried?
[07:52:24] <`ULT> here is the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/18/
[07:52:37] <taplar> 'tr' you probably know, 'td.rowdelete' probably also.  then there is 'input[type="checkbox"]' and then the ':selected' option
[07:53:03] <`ULT> is the filter method better than first solution?
[07:53:20] <`ULT> for me is the first solution a lot more readable.
[07:55:51] <taplar> make your numbers strings
[07:55:57] <taplar> '319'
[07:56:34] <PilotBob> taplar, yea, I get all that, but it seems really slow. not sure if I can speed it up.
[07:56:54] <taplar> which part?
[07:57:07] <PilotBob> I try this, and it takes like 1.5mins to run. $("td.row-deleted :input").each(function () {         if ($(this).is("checked")) {             $(this).closest("tr").hide();         }     });
[07:57:27] <PilotBob> there are 225 rows in the table.
[07:57:52] <`ULT> by making the numbers strings, BinaryKitten his code is working.
[07:59:40] <PilotBob> if I do $("td.row-deleted :input") in the console, it comes back almost instantly, but checking the value of each checkbox seems to take longer than it should.
[07:59:52] <BinaryKitten> her code.. but nvm glad to see you have it working
[08:00:08] <taplar> try $('td.row-deleted').find('input[type="checkbox]:selected').closest('tr').hide();
[08:00:28] <taplar> try $('td.row-deleted').find('input[type="checkbox"]:selected').closest('tr').hide();
[08:00:31] <taplar> missed a "
[08:00:45] <BinaryKitten> :checked not :selected
[08:01:00] <PilotBob> taplar: interesting, but it says unrecognized expression: input[type="checkbox]:selected
[08:01:01] <taplar> and ^
[08:01:04] <taplar> i never remember
[08:01:17] <taplar> i missed a " on the checkbox string
[08:01:27] <`ULT> sorry BinaryKitten haha
[08:01:29] <BinaryKitten> PilotBob: "]:checked
[08:01:46] <taplar> try $('td.row-deleted').find('input[type="checkbox"]:checked').closest('tr').hide();
[08:01:49] <PilotBob> taplar: yep, saw that. Thanks, I'll give it a shot.
[08:02:06] <`ULT> i thougt should you be a man or woman. BinaryKitten sounds a little womanly
[08:02:26] <BinaryKitten> `ULT ok.
[08:02:50] <BinaryKitten> not that my gender has any particular reference other than how i prefer to be address/referenced
[08:02:55] <BinaryKitten> so lets move on..
[08:03:02] <taplar> ^_^
[08:03:02] <`ULT> :)
[08:03:14] <BinaryKitten> *any particular relevance sorry
[08:07:32] <PilotBob> ok, small twist, it's not a checkbox, it's a text box. Can you do val='true'?
[08:07:55] <taplar> $(this).val() === ''
[08:08:05] <taplar> or replace data() with val()
[08:08:09] <taplar> if you still need your list check
[08:08:30] <taplar> oh, wait, different person had list
[08:08:55] <taplar> you'll need a filter for that
[08:09:09] <`ULT> BinaryKitten, can you maybe explain your code a little bit more? You put in a function in the filter. And than you putt some data in a array (data-product_id = 319, data-product_id = 320 and data-product_id = 321)
[08:09:37] <`ULT> but what is the (this) part and return part exactely doing?
[08:11:17] <taplar> filter is a function that can take either a selector or a function.  it works on a result set, filtering them, similar to find, except find looks for children that match
[08:11:34] <BinaryKitten> `ULT making a jsfiddle
[08:11:34] <taplar> if you give it a function, the function is expected to return true for the elements that you want to be included in your results
[08:12:25] <taplar> 'this' inside the filter function references the current element the filter is evaluating
[08:12:33] <PilotBob> so something like $('td.row-deleted').filter(function () { return $('input', this).val() == 'true' })
[08:13:20] <taplar> PilotBob: you'd want to do your filter on the inputs instead of the tds
[08:13:24] <BinaryKitten> `ULT http://jsfiddle.net/ue7xte1y/
[08:13:46] <BinaryKitten> taplar PilotBob is
[08:14:08] <PilotBob> taplar: not sure what you mean?
[08:14:08] <BinaryKitten> or at least using the input to filter
[08:14:45] <taplar> $('td.row-deleted input[type="text"]').filter(....)
[08:15:03] <`ULT> taplar and BinaryKitten, thanks alot! :)
[08:17:44] <PilotBob> taplar: ah so that is better than what I typed above?
[08:18:07] <taplar> it goes down to the collection your filtering on
[08:18:37] <taplar> otherwise for each td, you'd have to do an additional find to get the inputs
[08:21:11] <alexclark> can someone help me debug this defer?
[08:21:34] <PilotBob> so, not sure what's up here. This returns the correct set: $('td.row-deleted').filter(function () { return $('input', this).val() == 'true' })
[08:21:56] <alexclark> https://gist.github.com/alexclarkofficial/37323132deed91a069fa
[08:22:03] <alexclark> this will console log undefined
[08:22:13] <PilotBob> This returns nothing: $('td.row-deleted input').filter(function () { $(this).val() == 'true' })
[08:22:36] <taplar> alexclark: two done functions?
[08:22:46] <alexclark> taplar
[08:22:52] <alexclark> chained promises
[08:22:58] <alexclark> can i not do that using jquery?
[08:23:33] <taplar> i don't know that you cannot.  just seems strange
[08:24:16] <alexclark> async is hard
[08:24:40] <PilotBob> oh doh! Forgot the return in the other format.
[08:24:45] <taplar> would you not put the second done on the result of your checkCookie?
[08:25:06] <alexclark> taplar: like nest them?
[08:26:08] <taplar> well i'm guessing here at what your intention is.  is the second done meant to be applied to the deferred from checkCookie?
[08:26:25] <alexclark> taplar: yes
[08:26:55] <taplar> so yeah, i'd think it would need to be bg.checkCookie().done(...)
[08:28:33] <alexclark> taplar: thats not getting me what i want on the react side of things
[08:28:38] <alexclark> :/
[08:29:18] <taplar> hmm
[08:29:34] <PilotBob> taplar: thanks man, that works much faster than what I had.
[08:29:43] <taplar> cool
[08:30:09] <PilotBob> I wish I could use changetip in irc
[08:30:29] <BinaryKitten> heh
[08:30:47] <robertmaxrees> hah
[08:31:00] <robertmaxrees> we do it for free ;) that's part of the point.
[08:31:00] <BinaryKitten> people tipping? for help? in here?
[08:31:09] <PilotBob> got a btc address, I'll do it the ole fashion way and buy you a beer.
[08:31:10] * BinaryKitten falls about laughing her head off
[08:31:17] <taplar> more like cow tipping
[08:31:20] <robertmaxrees> PilotBob heh, we don't exchange money here :)
[08:31:23] <robertmaxrees> we do it for free.
[08:31:39] <PilotBob> well, much appreciated.
[08:31:49] <BinaryKitten> robertmaxrees - yeah we're suckers for it too..
[08:31:53] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[08:31:58] <taplar> i do it for the lolz.  and the change to make bad pun jokes
[08:32:04] <taplar> chance
[08:32:56] <BinaryKitten> gluton for punishments
[08:33:12] <BinaryKitten> puns for change would be a fine thing
[08:33:30] <taplar> when your master is the DOM, you enjoy punishment
[08:33:31] <taplar> bam!
[08:33:38] <taplar> like that
[08:35:02] <Abhijit> i want to call a function after specified interval by user. once user changes the interval the previous interval waiting process should be discarded. how to do this?
[08:35:06] <taplar> i meant that as like, 'boom, there's an example'  not, ya know, bam the dom hit me
[08:35:09] <naftilos76> Hi, i have been trying to copy the widths of the tds of a table and force those widths to a another table with the same number of columns. Before i do that i firstly force the table width of the second to match the first and then i started forcing one by one the width of each column (td). The weird thing however is that the sum of the individual widths of each td do not match the total width of the table which is absurd. I used .width() to get the w
[08:35:09] <naftilos76> idths. What am i missing here?
[08:35:56] <taplar> paddings?  spacings?  border widths?
[08:36:12] <taplar> margins?
[08:36:24] <robertmaxrees> naftilos76 sounds like you need to make a fiddle.
[08:36:34] <naftilos76> what is that?
[08:36:42] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/
[08:37:32] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit you'd use a recursive setTimeout call or setInterval and clearTimeout or clearInterval, depending on which option you went with.
[08:37:32] <naftilos76> taplar, you are probably right
[08:37:42] <naftilos76> thanks guys
[08:38:15] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, ok
[08:39:04] <hasan> hi all. is it better to load an html fragment into my website or provide the skeleton html already on the site and just load the data (the actual values) per JSON from the remote server?
[08:39:18] <robertmaxrees> the latter.
[08:39:41] <hasan> so the question is: should I use $.load() or use something like knockout.js to have the $.getJSON() returned JSON being mapped to an observable.
[08:39:44] <hasan> for instance.
[08:39:49] <robertmaxrees> hasan it really depends.
[08:40:13] <hasan> on what?
[08:40:45] <robertmaxrees> is this a new project?  do you need an mvc?  what are you buildng?
[08:40:49] <robertmaxrees> *building
[08:41:01] <hasan> the only difference I see is, going with the skeleton option you can see the empty html structure filled up with real data after the html request to fetch the JSON
[08:41:09] <hasan> robertmaxrees: yes new project. mvc.
[08:41:31] <robertmaxrees> hasan i'd go with an isomorphic approach so the initial page request is fully rendered.
[08:41:43] <hasan> but where the "M" and "C" is being done on the remote side.
[08:41:56] <robertmaxrees> you'll still need a client-side controller :)
[08:42:15] <hasan> my controller is servers side. if you mean the routing though.
[08:42:33] <robertmaxrees> please don't tell me you plan on putting ajax calls in your view...
[08:42:44] <hasan> yes
[08:42:48] <hasan> why not?
[08:42:59] <taplar> separation of responsibilities?
[08:42:59] <robertmaxrees> because that's not traditionally how you do MVC.
[08:43:11] <hasan> robertmaxrees: I don't even know how to do MVC with pure jquery.
[08:43:13] <robertmaxrees> if you used backbone, you'd put that in a model.
[08:43:20] <robertmaxrees> you don't do MVC with jquery.
[08:44:36] <hasan> take github for instance. if you go onto the "repositories" tab. you can see it loads a html fragment
[08:44:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[08:44:42] <hasan> and puts it into the tab div.
[08:44:42] <robertmaxrees> well aware.
[08:45:00] <robertmaxrees> if you used backbone, the ajax call would go in your model.
[08:45:27] <hasan> so, what would be the benefit of having no html fragments from remote server, instead pure JSON. and I map the JSON data into my already rendered html fragment
[08:45:54] <robertmaxrees> less network overhead, which can be very valuable for, say, mobile.
[08:46:21] <`ULT> hi BinaryKitten, your function: i cannot use it more than 1 time (duplicate)?
[08:46:31] <hasan> would I go with jquery to do this or is it better to use frameworks to handle this?
[08:46:32] <`ULT> Therefore i need to remove the values in the array?
[08:46:45] <robertmaxrees> hasan use an MV* framework for this.
[08:46:47] <hasan> like working with client side templates, render them after a getJSON etc.
[08:46:53] <BinaryKitten> `ULT the code i gave was a demo/example
[08:46:55] <hasan> robertmaxrees: any suggestions which one are out there?
[08:47:06] <`ULT> i have a live preview
[08:47:08] <BinaryKitten> the jsfiddle expanded on that to give external array
[08:47:09] <robertmaxrees> react, backbone, riot...
[08:47:25] <BinaryKitten> `ULT between the two i feel you should be able to proceed
[08:47:31] <hasan> ok thanks
[08:47:42] <robertmaxrees> hasan http://todomvc.com/ this is a good rundown on different available frameworks.
[08:48:15] <aeschylus> Hello. I am having a problem with jquery .on(). I am using it as documented (I am not "accidentally" not delegating). The problem also occurs when I do not delegate.
[08:48:20] <`ULT> hmm!!
[08:48:30] <robertmaxrees> aeschylus make a fiddle :)
[08:48:43] <hasan> uuh, somebody is using materialize.css :)
[08:48:46] <hasan> I like.
[08:48:47] <hasan> thank you.
[08:49:22] <aeschylus> I will make a fiddle if the following description does not trigger some past trauma recognition in a contributor here:
[08:49:36] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[08:49:37] <aeschylus> I am binding several event handlers to the same element:
[08:49:47] <taplar> no! god no!
[08:49:51] <taplar> jk
[08:49:52] <aeschylus> mouseover seems to override all others.
[08:50:09] <aeschylus> If I do not bind mouseover, click works. If I do, click does not work.
[08:50:24] <BinaryKitten> aeschylus - can you jsfiddle the code?
[08:50:32] <robertmaxrees> aeschylus yeah, that's not helpful.
[08:50:38] <aeschylus> Fair enough.
[08:50:38] <robertmaxrees> we need a fiddle.
[08:50:41] <Abhijit> this should work if(channel=="google") right?
[08:50:42] <aeschylus> I'll get back in a moment.
[08:50:58] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit if channel holds that value, sure.
[08:51:24] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, var channel = this.value; on dropdown value change
[08:51:30] <robertmaxrees> then sure.
[08:51:35] <robertmaxrees> use === instead of == though
[08:52:20] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, so i have three options in select. Change. Google. CNN. when i select google if condition works. if i select cnn if condition works. if i select change it passes that value to my ajax call even though i have last "else" statement
[08:52:34] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit make a fiddle.
[08:52:40] <robertmaxrees> i can't divine your code.
[08:52:46] <Abhijit> :-(
[08:52:52] <robertmaxrees> really easy to do :)
[08:54:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sb9Lyrb8/ here, i even started one for you.
[08:59:06] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, nothing works in jsfiddel https://jsfiddle.net/yLa7hwy7/2/
[08:59:18] <robertmaxrees> you have to include jquery
[08:59:21] <robertmaxrees> top left dropdown
[08:59:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yLa7hwy7/3/
[09:00:00] <Abhijit> ok
[09:00:04] <Abhijit> now it works here.
[09:00:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yLa7hwy7/4/
[09:00:07] <robertmaxrees> this works fine.
[09:00:28] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, the only change i have in my original code is that both if and else if condition has one getJSON call.
[09:02:42] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, if both condition fails, how come it still executes that json call with input as "Change"?
[09:02:49] <Abhijit> value change do not matches anything at all
[09:03:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:03:09] <`ULT> binaryKitten, i`m afraid I tested your code not good enough. It is not working correct :o
[09:03:09] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up.
[09:03:09] <Abhijit> i mean value default
[09:03:18] <`ULT> instead of filtering it is showing all the rows.
[09:03:44] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit could you clarify where things are breaking?
[09:03:45] <BinaryKitten> `ULT without seeing your working, there is little i can do to help you with "it's not working"
[09:03:58] <`ULT> true, i prepare the fiddle
[09:04:23] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, at the if condition
[09:04:30] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/19/
[09:04:42] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit this fiddle seems to work fine.
[09:04:49] <`ULT> when clicking on type poort: vrijstaand
[09:04:51] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, so my flask is doing "GET /getfeeds?channel=default HTTP/1.1" 500 - when i select the "Change" from that dropdown
[09:05:02] <`ULT> we expect to see 1 row, but we see all the products (rows)
[09:05:18] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit do you have a click event handler bound or something?
[09:05:25] <`ULT> I can understand your code. But i can not see why it is not working.
[09:05:35] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, yes. on dropdown option change as shown in this jsfiddle?
[09:06:09] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit thatns a "change" event, not "click" - i don't understand what your bug is - how do I replicate it in fiddle?
[09:06:32] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, call getJSON in both if and else if condition.
[09:06:46] <Abhijit> not in last "else" condition
[09:06:50] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit you've got a fiddle that seemingly works fine but then keep describing problems with code not contained inside the fiddle.
[09:06:58] <BinaryKitten> `ULT ok
[09:07:11] <BinaryKitten> `ULT what denotes which products to show/
[09:07:13] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, i will have to pastebin that flask code too for that getjson right?
[09:07:27] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit is the issue with flask?  or with jquery?'
[09:07:43] <Abhijit> jquery.
[09:07:50] <Abhijit> that "if else if else" condition is failing
[09:07:55] <robertmaxrees> then i don't need to see the flask code.
[09:08:10] <Abhijit> let me copy paste my code then
[09:08:16] <`ULT> data-product_id="319"
[09:08:24] <`ULT> * data-product_id
[09:08:36] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, please check https://jsfiddle.net/yLa7hwy7/5/
[09:08:51] <robertmaxrees> woah wut.
[09:08:52] <`ULT> on the table row
[09:08:53] <robertmaxrees> okay/.
[09:09:06] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit so what do i do next?
[09:09:07] <BinaryKitten> `ULT that's the info..
[09:09:11] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, :-D
[09:09:21] <robertmaxrees> how do i replicate the bug?
[09:09:30] <gnarf> `ULT: .data('product_id') will return a number, not a string
[09:09:31] <BinaryKitten> but that doesn't say which controlls it
[09:09:32] <gnarf> https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/20/
[09:09:40] <Abhijit> is there something online i can call in json for our testing? robertmaxrees
[09:09:41] <gnarf> also .inArray() returns -1 when not found
[09:09:42] <BinaryKitten> is it the typePoort?
[09:09:49] <`ULT> yes
[09:10:10] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit jsfiddle has an echo api you can use, but i can see the (failing) network requests.
[09:10:15] <robertmaxrees> so that's fine.
[09:10:16] <gnarf> `ULT: also - your css/html is atrocious, try using classes instead and defining all the properties in css instead of on style attributes
[09:10:41] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit so how do i replicate your bug?
[09:10:44] <BinaryKitten> gnarf - hey lets help with the issue, then move on to constructive criticism
[09:10:58] <gnarf> Your HTML has uneven tags all over the place (closing divs and tds out of order, etc) -- fiddle highlights all of them in red
[09:11:10] <robertmaxrees> ^ this can cause major problems with code fwiw.
[09:11:54] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: the issue already was solved -- https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/20/ --  $('table tr').hide().filter(function () { return $.inArray($(this).data('product_id'), [319]) !== -1; }).show(); <-- needed [319] to be a number, not a string, and needed to check !== -1 for "was found"
[09:12:09] <gnarf> his other filter was filtering everything because nothing matched ["319"] and -1 is "found"
[09:12:23] <gnarf> s/"found"/ "not found"
[09:12:47] <gnarf> -1 is "truthy" so the inArray filter was returning truthy for everything
[09:13:04] <robertmaxrees> because any number other than 0 is truthy
[09:13:05] <`ULT> 1 moment :p
[09:13:28] <taplar> huh, so inArray doesn't return boolean?
[09:13:41] <gnarf> taplar: no, it's indexOf semantics - returns position in array
[09:13:45] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/ - "Returns: number"
[09:13:50] <BinaryKitten> gnarf - reason i was complaining was that been helping with this a while.. just trying to also get a deploy out
[09:14:02] <taplar> weird, so why have the wrapper instead of just using indexOf?
[09:14:02] <gnarf> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[09:14:11] <BinaryKitten> I was also hoping that `ULT would notice the inArray issue and be able to read the docs
[09:14:12] <robertmaxrees> gnarf i beat you there :)
[09:14:28] * BinaryKitten is too hopeful these days
[09:14:50] <gnarf> taplar: Array.indexOf is ES5, not supported in IE<9
[09:15:00] <taplar> ah
[09:15:01] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, i just removed that Change option. kept google and cnn. it works. thanksn btw. good night.
[09:15:10] <`ULT> yeah, dont expect tomutch from newbs BinaryKitten ;)
[09:15:27] <gnarf> taplar: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf#Specifications
[09:15:37] <`ULT> after some food i will study all the things you guys said.
[09:15:39] <`ULT> thanks
[09:15:43] <`ULT> brb
[09:15:56] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: sorry - didn't mean to steal a supportee - just saw the error quick :)
[09:16:31] <robertmaxrees> gnarf likes to pop in and blows some minds.
[09:16:45] <gnarf> better than blowing transistors :)
[09:16:45] <taplar> makes sense.  for some reason i was thinking indexOf had been around forever
[09:17:15] <gnarf> taplar: String.prototype.indexOf has
[09:17:45] <gnarf> taplar: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf#Specifications ES1st
[09:18:22] <taplar> it was a thursday, when taplar was skooled by the gnarf
[09:18:56] <robertmaxrees> aaaand that's why i use es5-shim
[09:19:00] <gnarf> I wish I could forget the days before ES5 ;)
[09:22:02] <BinaryKitten> gnarf no problem..
[09:24:03] <Dr-007> i'm getting this error and it is driving me nuts; TypeError: x.easing[this.easing] is not a function
[09:24:20] <Dr-007> googling this issue stated that this is because jquery changed the easing names
[09:24:23] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're trying to use something before it's defined.
[09:24:40] <Dr-007> so i downgraded my jquery and jquery ui. but the error pretty much remained the same
[09:25:05] <Dr-007> also upgrading the jquery to the newest newest version gave an error times 500
[09:25:17] <robertmaxrees> what version are you coming from?
[09:25:35] <Dr-007> robertmaxrees, i'm now using jquery 1.10
[09:25:44] <Dr-007> that also indeed
[09:25:51] <Dr-007> i found that online aswell
[09:26:07] <Dr-007> so i put the ready tags around the script that gives me this error
[09:26:08] <robertmaxrees> is that what you updated to?  what version are you coming from?
[09:26:30] <robertmaxrees> and document ready won't fix using things before they're defined btw.
[09:27:00] <Dr-007> no i am using jquery 1.10 right now. i upgraded to the newest one. but that broke the whole site
[09:27:35] <Dr-007> so you mean the order of the javascript documents could be wrong?
[09:27:48] <robertmaxrees> maybe?  without seeing the site it's hard to know.
[09:28:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd make sure you're loading things in the correct order, then verify your pages are valid.
[09:28:46] <Dr-007> yes i'm checking it now
[09:29:00] <Dr-007> seems ok to me jquery > jquery ui > tagit
[09:29:15] <Dr-007> but its probably the tagit script thats outdated
[09:29:41] <Dr-007> im using one from another git branche for json autocompletion sweetness
[09:29:59] <robertmaxrees> if it worked with 1.10, it should work with a more recent version.
[09:30:04] <robertmaxrees> something seems really funky here.
[09:32:24] <Dr-007> it doesn't work with 1.10, it doesnt work with any of them
[09:32:30] <Dr-007> but the problem could also be..
[09:33:19] <Dr-007> im working with drupal. when you want to embed jquery or jquery ui. you will have to be real specific when embedding
[09:33:32] <Dr-007> because they cut up every jquery document to little pieces
[09:33:48] <Dr-007> like jquery.effects.bounce etc
[09:38:52] <PilotBob> Another question... is there something like serialize() but that creates a json object rather than a formEncoded string?
[09:41:41] <mdev> https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[09:41:53] <mdev> oh jsob object
[09:42:09] <mdev> https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject
[09:54:20] <Dr-007> robertmaxrees, its fixed! i just disabled the animations :P

[10:15:00] <robertmaxrees> Guest52575 i would think https://github.com/polarblau/stickySectionHeaders/blob/master/src/jquery.stickysectionheaders.js#L36-L40
[10:15:06] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit the change event.
[10:15:11] <robertmaxrees> Abhijit or the input event, either/or.
[10:15:22] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, $("#tv").change(function(){ do not work
[10:15:32] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the code, i can't help.
[10:15:36] <Abhijit> :-)
[10:15:36] <Guest5267> robertmaxrees, yes that the source
[10:15:47] <robertmaxrees> Guest52575 that's where the magic happens it looks like.
[10:15:56] <Guest5267> but, how does the header gets stuck with position: absolute?
[10:16:13] <robertmaxrees> (height + top < headHeight) ? (headHeight - (top + height)) * -1 : '',
[10:16:18] <robertmaxrees> for the top property.
[10:16:29] <Guest5267> shouldn't absolute fix top-left of container but continue scrolling because "pinned" to its parent?
[10:16:31] <robertmaxrees> oh - $this.removeClass(settings.stickyClass).css('paddingTop', '');
[10:17:03] <robertmaxrees> Guest52575 is there a particular reason you're confused?
[10:17:14] <robertmaxrees> or are you just trying to understand how this works?
[10:17:15] <gnarf> Guest5267: without looking at the code - I'm assuming that it updates its position on scroll events instead of using position: fixed cuz fixed sucks hard in old android
[10:17:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:18:08] <Guest5267> robertmaxrees, i just can't explain how absolute gets fixed
[10:18:16] <robertmaxrees> gnarf just explained it.
[10:18:21] <Guest5267> or better, understand
[10:18:58] <Guest5267> the code adds a sticky class with position:absolute to the headers container div
[10:19:08] <robertmaxrees> correct - then updates the position on scroll.
[10:19:25] <Guest5267> then, the headers sticks on top and dosn't continue scrolling like any absolute div should
[10:19:49] <robertmaxrees> because it manually "fixes" it by updating its position.
[10:20:04] <Guest5267> you mean it changes top on every scroll message?
[10:20:08] <robertmaxrees> *not css position property, but probably by using top.
[10:20:19] <robertmaxrees> yes - reread what gnarf said :)
[10:20:50] <gnarf> top/paddingTop/something like that
[10:20:59] <Guest5267> gnarf, i knew that fixe was a problem for iphone really
[10:21:02] <gnarf> its a LOT more performat
[10:21:07] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, what does === do vs ==
[10:21:24] <gnarf> Abhijit: try -- 2 == "2" and 2 === "2"
[10:21:50] <gnarf> Abhijit: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators
[10:21:53] <Guest5267> my problem is that whn i put that suff in an absolute div with x scrolling, it doesn't work
[10:22:00] <Guest5267> so, i can't get why
[10:22:05] <Abhijit> gnarf, thanks.
[10:22:12] <vanseverk> Hi guys, how can I use AJAX and Select2 for an ajax result like ["foo"]? My current code is like http://pastebin.com/pq12KmYe
[10:22:31] <vanseverk> Right now I'm just getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[10:23:28] <Guest5267> is it because the sample gas the scroller inside the stick-list container?
[10:23:40] <Guest5267> gas=has
[10:24:23] <Guest5267> i'll build a jsfiddle sample
[10:24:25] <Guest5267> latere
[10:24:28] <Guest5267> later
[10:45:54] <`ULT> hi gnarf, i checked all your information. Thank you.
[10:47:00] <`ULT> 1 thing over the html. I dont think jsfiddle is highlighting the tags correct.
[10:47:15] <`ULT> Can you tell me what is wrong with this code?
[10:47:15] <Sal__> ok
[10:47:19] <Sal__> done

[10:49:34] <Abhijit> robertmaxrees, ok
[10:51:11] <vanseverk> Hi guys, does anyone here have any advice on how I can combine Select2's AJAX and initSelection?
[10:51:58] <vanseverk> http://pastebin.com/8jbyP0jP This is my current code
[10:52:15] <vanseverk> the AJAX call returns something in the stlye of ["bla", "foo"]
[10:54:20] <saml> how can I remove click event handler from all elements?
[10:54:38] <robertmaxrees> $('*').off('click');
[10:54:43] <robertmaxrees> that'll only handle jquery handlers.

[10:55:28] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[10:55:34] <Sal> all i did was get that exact sample and put it in my layout
[10:55:47] <robertmaxrees> you didn't include the plugin on that fiddle.
[10:56:03] <vanseverk> So..can anyone answer my question too?
[10:56:09] <Sal> http://polarblau.github.io/stickySectionHeaders/
[10:56:17] <robertmaxrees> Sal so include it in the fiddle...
[10:56:26] <Sal> i did, by code
[10:56:29] <Sal> its there
[10:56:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:56:42] <Sal> its in the js pane
[10:56:54] <Sal> i pasted the code
[10:57:06] <robertmaxrees> look in your console yo.
[10:57:20] <robertmaxrees> you try to use it before it's defined.

[14:42:36] <ArchNoob> hello.. anyone here ..!
[14:54:30] <ArchNoob> help!??
[15:01:07] <derstrom> ArchNoob: Google searching can usually help with questions like this. E.g. http://codecanyon.net/item/jquery-handwriting/6354107
[15:01:35] <derstrom> With this library you can also hide the pen if you want.
[15:02:23] <Sal> can someone help me make this code scroll on the id="mainArea" container instead on the <ul> its using? https://jsfiddle.net/rcbmtmv0/5/
[15:02:29] <Sal> when i try to move it on mainArea, the headers dont stick anymore
[15:03:10] <ArchNoob> derstrom: you are right, i have google searched very much .. but wasn't so successful.. also wanted to get some other suggestions .. maybe i may be looking in a wrong direction..
[15:03:21] <ArchNoob> derstrom: thanks for the link.. :)
[15:04:45] <Sal> can someone help me make this code scroll on the id="mainArea" container instead on the <ul> its using? https://jsfiddle.net/rcbmtmv0/5/
[15:04:46] <derstrom> ArchNoob: No problem, sometimes it's the search terms we use that's the problem. I searched for "handwriting text jquery" and that appeared as the first result.
[15:04:47] <Sal> when i try to move it on mainArea, the headers dont stick anymore
[15:06:59] <ArchNoob> derstrom: haha.. seriously.. i never saw anything like that.. and searched for like 3/4 days.. Thanks.. :)
[15:07:59] <derstrom> ArchNoob: No probs.
[15:40:21] <LindsayMac> anyone here familiar with backbone.js and maybe how WP deals with backbone.js
[15:46:29] <guideX> I always seem to have problems with .prop and .attr $(topupNow).prop("disabled", false);
[15:46:46] <guideX> this isn't working
[15:46:49] <guideX> also tried attr
[15:47:12] <guideX> looks like jquery 10.2
[15:47:21] <guideX> 1.10.2
[15:49:36] <guideX> also tried removeAttr
[15:49:46] <shoky> .prop("disabled", false);   should work if run on the right element
[15:50:03] <shoky> and.. depending on what you expect it to do
[15:50:16] <guideX> the other things are working on the same element.. $(topupNow).css("opacity", "1.0"); and $(topupNow).show();
[15:50:28] <shoky> what element is it
[15:50:43] <guideX> it's an input button
[15:50:51] <guideX> not dynamically created
[15:51:00] <shoky> and it's disabled?
[15:51:02] <guideX> it starts out with disbaled
[15:51:03] <guideX> yes
[15:51:12] <guideX> it's also hidden at first
[15:51:21] <shoky> and this is a regular disabled, not some library just making it look & behave disabled ?
[15:51:46] <guideX> well I'm using bootstrap, I start like this <input disabled style="display: hidden;" />
[15:52:42] <shoky> can you make a fiddle or link to it?
[15:52:43] <guideX> I do this to find it.. var topupNow = $(tr).find(".cmdTopupNow");
[15:52:45] <guideX> sure
[15:53:47] <guideX> hrm.. I guess jsfiddle is blocked here, or it's not coming up for me...
[15:53:55] <guideX> let me see if I can do it at home on team viewer
[15:53:58] <shoky> jsbin?
[15:54:06] <Sal> can someone help me make this code scroll on the id="mainArea" container instead on the <ul> its using? https://jsfiddle.net/rcbmtmv0/5/
[15:54:08] <Sal> when i try to move it on mainArea, the headers dont stick anymore
[15:54:13] <guideX> ok that's working
[15:55:02] <guideX> one second..
[15:56:10] <guideX> hrm I'm not sure with jsbin, can you do jquery?
[15:56:20] <guideX> it doesn't seem to be working... nmaybe I need to specify the lib myself
[15:57:02] <shoky> Sal: what do you mean?
[15:57:32] <Sal> as you can see, the lists scrolls on the <ul> element
[15:57:37] <shoky> guideX: "Add library"
[15:57:43] <Sal> its that element that shows scrollbars
[15:58:02] <Sal> i want it to scroll on the mainArea div
[15:58:09] <guideX> ah ok
[15:58:12] <Sal> that element also has overflow-y auto
[15:58:41] <Sal> but, when i move the classes and change the js code, the headers stop sticking
[15:59:46] <shoky> move what classes
[16:00:24] <Sal> as i saw, the js function, works on sticky-list and sticky-header (or h2 in that sample)
[16:00:42] <Sal> it looks for headers insyde the sticky-list
[16:00:59] <Sal> so i tried movin sticky list to #mainArea
[16:01:22] <Sal> and then, where the code does a .find('> ul')
[16:01:40] <guideX> shocky: so that scenario works in this jsbin
[16:01:52] <Sal> because it wants to attach a listener to the scroll event, i cganges to to #mainArea too
[16:01:53] <guideX> but not in my code..
[16:02:07] <Sal> because thats the element that should scroll
[16:02:50] <guideX> https://jsbin.com/zacolecige/edit?html,js,output
[16:03:03] <guideX> so why does it work in here, and not in my code
[16:21:33] <shoky> Sal: it's kinda tricky to do that, needs some css fiddling and changing some of the code.. at least i dont have any simple idea, if i even understood what you want..
[16:22:37] <Sal> it has a relative container (#sticky-list) and in this, it has the scrolling container (ul)
[16:23:10] <Sal> when it adds a class of header to set position:absolute
[16:23:32] <Sal> the headers gets aligned to the first parent  going up tree that has position:relative
[16:23:42] <Sal> so it aligns in #sticky-list
[16:23:43] <shoky> yes but the problem is if you want the container to be the one scrolling, then  position:absolute will not give you an easy way anymore to make it sticky
[16:24:08] <shoky> so you have to do some calculations. and i'm not in the mood for those now ;p
[16:24:29] <Sal> so i need to separate absolute and scroller?
[16:24:43] <Sal> like the author does with that sample i got
[16:25:12] <shoky> this is as far as i got, but i got other things i'd rather be doing ;)  https://jsfiddle.net/rcbmtmv0/7/
[16:25:32] <Sal> ok, thanks
[16:25:34] <shoky> er
[16:25:38] <Sal> i'll take a look
[16:25:52] <shoky> wait that's not the one i wanted to paste
[16:26:44] <shoky> this one  https://jsfiddle.net/rcbmtmv0/9/
[16:27:01] <shoky> there's probably an easier way ;z
[16:28:35] <Sal> thanks, let me see your way to get more ideas
[16:33:41] <ahhughes> strange one... when doing an $.ajax( { data : { blah : ["hello"] } } ) on the server, the param name received is "blah[]" and the value is "hello"... I expect/need "blah" and "[\"hello\"]" ... any ideas why?
[16:38:09] <shoky> eh Sal should've been more patient :\  http://jsfiddle.net/rcbmtmv0/10/
[16:39:27] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:46:35] <shoky> ahhughes: the reason for that is found here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/    the $.param() method serializes deep objects recursively to accommodate modern scripting languages and frameworks such as PHP and Ruby on Rails
[16:47:25] <guideX> for some reason, the button does change from jquery, but it's still actually disabled.. I cannot click it <input style="opacity: 1;" type="button" class="cmdTopupNow button button-small" value="Topup Now">
[16:47:32] <shoky> ahhughes: to get your desired output you can do  $.ajax({data: {blah: '["hello"]'}})  i think
[16:48:11] <guideX> so it actually does remove the attribute, but on the front end, it's not updated
[16:48:32] <guideX> could that be like a bootstrap problem?
[16:48:54] <guideX> maybe there's something I can do to poke the button into updating or something?
[16:49:54] <ahhughes> shoky: yeah, I did a JSON.stringify()... is that a good idea to use that or is there a jQuery way?
[16:50:14] <shoky> ahhughes json is a good idea ;)
[16:50:31] <shoky> assuming your backend knows json
[16:50:39] <shoky> which it should
[16:50:54] <ahhughes> it accepts and string and then it serializes it with Gson
[16:50:56] <ahhughes> ..java
[16:51:05] <shoky> ;S
[16:51:15] <ahhughes> thanks for the explaination!!!!
[16:51:46] <guideX> ok, now I know what I'm up against.. the button just won't click ever
[16:52:02] <guideX> I have no idea why... I'll fix that instead, thanks for listen to me blunder through it :P
[17:21:32] <jchosen> is it possible to get screen size without the use of javascript?
[17:21:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:22:25] <jchosen> just trying to make my page as clean as possible for anyone who has javascript disabled...and wondering if it's even possible
[17:22:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about why you would need that information if they don't have javascript.
[17:23:05] <jchosen> so i can set the page up properly
[17:23:13] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify?
[17:23:19] <jchosen> so I have like 9 images
[17:23:23] <jchosen> that are in a grid layout
[17:23:43] <robertmaxrees> also: javascript is a reasonable requirement to expect your end users to meet to use a site.
[17:23:54] <robertmaxrees> and CSS can operate using percentages.
[17:23:56] <jchosen> i'm using a table, I tried setting width to 33% but the images load before the percent can kick in causing glitchy looking page
[17:24:08] <jchosen> so I set the width to like 120px  and it was perfect
[17:24:10] <robertmaxrees> don't use tables for that.
[17:24:18] <jchosen> well it's div's with table layout
[17:24:30] <robertmaxrees> unless you actually have tabular data - they fall apart for layout quickly.
[17:24:31] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[17:24:34] <robertmaxrees> don't use table layout.
[17:24:39] <jchosen> slightly different...but the point is, if I can pre render everything the display will be fine.
[17:24:50] <snover> robertmaxrees: that is not good advice.
[17:24:51] <robertmaxrees> not different enough ;)
[17:24:59] <snover> table layout is just a way of doing layout
[17:25:00] <jchosen> but without the use of knowing the screen size, i'm kinda at a loss
[17:25:06] <robertmaxrees> table layout is for tabular data.
[17:25:09] <snover> no
[17:25:13] <robertmaxrees> i disagree with you.
[17:25:15] <robertmaxrees> :)_
[17:25:16] <snover> table elements are for tabular data
[17:25:18] <jchosen> guys don't fight
[17:25:22] <snover> table layout is a layout method
[17:25:28] <jchosen> listen if I knew screen size before hand I could solve all my problems
[17:25:36] <jchosen> but this question is for people who don't have javascript sooo like what to do?
[17:25:38] <snover> jchosen: not sure how
[17:25:40] <robertmaxrees> snover i don't think that's a good layout method.
[17:25:51] <snover> jchosen: use the vw/vh units
[17:25:52] <jchosen> if you can't that's an answer as well, i'm just asking
[17:26:16] <jchosen> snover do you have an example of how vw/vh can help me just for this simple gridlayout?
[17:26:20] <robertmaxrees> personally, i wouldn't use tables/"table layout".
[17:26:47] <robertmaxrees> use plain ol' percentages and floats and whatnot.  though like i said, javascript is a pretty reasonable requirement these days.
[17:26:55] <jchosen> I just need 3 collumns of equal width & height
[17:27:04] <jchosen> no matter what the screen size it's just always even.
[17:27:22] <jchosen> and I can't use flexbox...
[17:27:22] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-equal-height-columns/
[17:27:27] <snover> do not use floats for this
[17:27:41] <robertmaxrees> lots of different options.
[17:27:47] <snover> jchosen: where is your test case?
[17:27:57] <jchosen> i don't have one I can make one but like
[17:28:08] <jchosen> my method works right now using javascript to determine the width pre rendered
[17:28:10] <robertmaxrees> ^ check out that article, jchosen
[17:28:16] <jchosen> i am, i'm multitasking :D
[17:28:26] <robertmaxrees> it's exactly the kind of thing you should be reading :)
[17:28:28] <snover> that article is massively overcomplicating the problem
[17:28:51] <robertmaxrees> snover i disagree.  he literally just asked a question that article is meant to answer :)
[17:28:55] <jchosen> it's very odd how my soultion fails
[17:29:04] <jchosen> like sometimes it loads perfectly via percentages...and other it fails
[17:29:20] <jchosen> i think it has to do with the image loading creating the "percent"
[17:29:53] <jchosen> in fact I bet if it's text...it will never fail
[17:29:58] <snover> http://jsfiddle.net/6um1so2e/
[17:30:01] <jchosen> it's the fact that it's images of different heights/widths that it fails
[17:30:02] <snover> 5 lines of css
[17:30:22] <jchosen> snover that was my method
[17:30:31] <jchosen> but if you put images and try to load via a phone, it can fail
[17:30:55] <snover> i’m sorry did you ever use the word phone before?
[17:30:56] <jchosen> through browser I have yet to see it fail...like ethernet it doesn't but a slow load time can fail it
[17:31:07] <jchosen> well no but i was asking a different question
[17:31:13] <jchosen> you guys are asking why i'm asking thus leading to this
[17:31:29] <snover> if you do not have viewport meta set correctly then the renderer on a phone will distort your page at will
[17:31:36] <snover> it has nothing to do with anything
[17:31:42] <jchosen> interesting
[17:31:50] <jchosen> i'm using 100% zoom...
[17:32:14] <jchosen> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, height=device-height,  initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no;user-scalable=0;"/>
[17:33:02] <jchosen> also for this test i'm loading the page of images via jquery
[17:33:15] <snover> then how could you not be running javascript
[17:33:23] <jchosen> well in the future i'd change it
[17:33:25] <jchosen> to just be a standalone page
[17:33:35] <jchosen> but now i'm thinking perhaps i'm causing the image glitch
[17:33:49] <jchosen> lemme setup a test just to make sure 1 sec
[17:42:47] <jchosen> hmm
[17:42:52] <jchosen> without jquery it actually loads perfectly
[17:43:00] <jchosen> wait...
[17:43:20] <jchosen> yeah that image has a white border yup perfect
[17:44:43] <jchosen> ok now lets add this viewport stuff to see if it's that
[17:44:53] <jchosen> snover you've been a great help to identify this
[17:46:10] <jchosen> interesting it actually loads super perfectly without my code
[17:46:32] <jchosen> well that's good to know, it's something i'm doing wrong in the .load method...
[17:49:34] <jchosen> snover thank you for helping to identify my issue, now I just have to figure out why .load is having issues doing this  but atleast for my non javascript page it will work :D

[18:08:34] <Sal> hey dear helpers!, i almost finished
[18:08:35] <Sal> https://jsfiddle.net/rcbmtmv0/12/
[18:09:25] <Sal> just a little defect when header is pushed up by nect one
[18:09:44] <Sal> and also, it seems that headers stick too high
[18:09:52] <Sal> they should stick at scrollbar top
[18:10:06] <Sal> can someone please take a look, i'm not able to finish this part
[18:10:07] <Sal> https://jsfiddle.net/rcbmtmv0/12/
[18:14:01] <JonBa> I'm going a $.get() request after page load, and that request takes a few seconds.  If I click on any link of the page to navigate to another page, that doesn't go until the $.get() request is done -- I presume due to a browser connection limit.  I was thinking about attaching an "request.abort();" event to a click anywhere on the page...is that the right approach?  It seems like a big hammer.....
[18:17:38] <JonBa> I've been Googling the issue, but its tricky to find....might not be using the right terms.
[18:19:44] <Sal> JonBa, get() should be fast. I always use ajax() but get() should be a short ajax() call
[18:20:06] <Sal> check events and callbacks
[18:20:30] <JonBa> The reason it is long is server-side
[18:20:53] <Sal> if you do the same call by browser, does it take the same time?
[18:21:17] <JonBa> But point taken, if I have a long ajax call, and if I can't shorten the call, maybe I fundamentally need to rethink this.
[18:21:48] <JonBa> Answering your 2nd question:  Yes.
[18:22:20] <JonBa> Its only a few seconds, but enough to make the experience feel laggy if you try to navigate somewhere else
[18:24:06] <Sal> you should abort request when user clicks on a link
[18:24:11] <JonBa> What I'm doing is taking social media share counts server-side.  I didn't want all this JS crap and tons of social media APIs loading to the client....I can vastly clean up the client side by making a single call to a page on MY site for the counts.
[18:24:24] <Sal> use a flag to see if browser is still waiting answer
[18:24:25] <JonBa> It works really well, but server-side that takes a few seconds to do
[18:24:30] <JonBa> Maybe the idea is just bad overall.
[18:24:39] <Sal> if so, and user clicks a link, forst abort request and then go to url
[18:25:21] <JonBa> yeah, that's what I'm thinking.....that isn't too crazy do to?
[18:25:41] <Sal> no
[18:25:46] <JonBa> I guess I have this fear that attaching a JS event to every element on the page presents....heck, even a risk to Google rankings or something
[18:26:07] <Sal> if user choose to go to another page, all ajax requests on the page should be aborted
[18:26:27] <FearDread05> greetings
[18:26:27] <JonBa> I'm suprised Chrome doesn't do that itself
[18:26:53] <Sal> are you creating content using js?
[18:27:08] <JonBa> no
[18:27:23] <JonBa> oh well...I'm populating the share counts, yeah....
[18:27:35] <FearDread05> js is the ultimate
[18:27:36] <Sal> so why are you adding events to every element?
[18:27:45] <JonBa> to cancel the request
[18:28:11] <JonBa> I could probably get away with only <a> elements
[18:28:13] <Sal> no, its to 1 class , that you apply to all
[18:29:29] <JonBa> can i just do $(document).click() ?
[18:29:39] <arc_> try it
[18:29:46] <Sal> hehehe
[18:30:07] <Sal> you want to write as less as possible
[18:30:15] <JonBa> I feel like I'm ripe for an Alt-F4 prank right now :)
[18:30:27] <Sal> :)
[18:30:53] <javalover> snover, so thx to everything you said I was able to identify that my .load method was rendering in the wrong meta viewport settings...did some tests & now it's perfect this is great news for both the jquery method & the non jquery method WOOHOO!! 2 birds one Snoverrrr :D
[18:30:58] <arc_> clicks already propogate to the document level anyway
[18:31:01] <arc_> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[18:31:07] <arc_> look under event propogation
[18:32:14] <Sal> just $('.abortRequest').on('click', .....);
[18:32:46] <Sal> and put that class wherever you want the user to be able to abort requests
[18:42:53] <FearDread05> why use $(selector).on  when $(selector).click does same thing with less options?  should always use shorthand methods when available no?
[18:44:02] <FearDread05> $(selector).on is best for triggering custom event handlers, but standard ones such as click, hover, etc.. I think are best when its not a custom event handler
[18:45:37] <FearDread05> any plugin authors here?
[19:16:13] <FearDread05> greetings jquery
[19:16:27] <FearDread05> any plugin authors available at the moment?
[19:16:32] <acidjazz> GREETINGS HAVE A SEAT
[19:16:32] <acidjazz> sort of
[19:16:33] <acidjazz> wahts up
[19:17:54] <FearDread05> not much, I develop with Nodejs and use jQuery for my front end stuff, have developed couple plugins myself and am looking for some fellow developers to possibly help with a Github project of mine
[19:18:38] <FearDread05> developing a small Sandbox pattern front end jQuery framework with pure js fallbacks for those unfortunate enough not to know about the greatness of jQuery :p
[19:19:57] <FearDread05> new to weechat though, does it have a contact manager or no?
[19:38:47] <ZeuZ> if I have a binded a functino through on('click') can I bind another and have both execute on click?
[19:39:57] <ZeuZ> function*
[19:43:18] <sqram> is it possble to assign a variable to the content of an ajax request in  `1 go?
[19:43:53] <sqram> like var foo = $.get('foo.txt').responseText    (which obv doesnt work, but demonstrates what im asking)
[20:04:47] <Unopoo> how can I bind `addToCart` both to #ele1's click event and #ele2's hover event?
[20:06:04] <Unopoo> using one line code?
[20:06:07] <Unopoo> instead of ele1.on('click', addToCart); ele2.on('hover', addToCart);
[20:15:44] <FearDread05> hey zeuz, are you trying to execute two different functions on the same click event?
[20:18:13] <sqram> Unopoo: $('#element1, #element2').click(function() { .. })
[20:22:07] <FearDread05> Well for ZeuZ, you can execute any arbritrary number of functions for any event.  And there are several ways to achieve that.
[20:23:06] <FearDread05> one way is to simply call all needed functions wrapped in the click function, $(selector).click(function(){ function1(); function2(); });
[20:24:44] <FearDread05> another way is to create a wrapper function that calls all the needed functions you want to execute for that event, like so | function allmyfunctions(){ function1(); function2(); };  and then $(selector).click('allmyfunctions');
[22:19:14] <FearDread05> nite jquery
[22:20:38] <Uhkis> morning.
[22:39:35] <gurke_> good morning.
[23:39:40] <norc> Is Promise.done() preferred to providing sucess/fail callbacks to ajax calls, and why?
[23:45:22] <BenL90> hello, I have a string that always changable, then I wanto search into the string and find something in the string, if there's no string so I don't change it. How?
[23:50:32] <duikb00t> yo
[23:50:46] <duikb00t> BenL90 plz jsfiddle
[23:51:23] <BenL90> wait
[23:52:17] <BenL90> duikb00t: I've fix it, thanks
[23:59:11] <duikb00t> good.
