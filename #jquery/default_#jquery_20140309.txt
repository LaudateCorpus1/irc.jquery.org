[00:01:39] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: If I want to do two things on key press
[00:01:44] <nahtnam> Is this the correct syntax?
[00:01:48] <nahtnam> onkeypress="validate(this); value(this);"
[00:02:07] <Jattenalle> you probably want onchange, but yeah
[00:02:08] <Jattenalle> that'd work
[00:03:16] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: Onchange wont work unless I press enter..
[00:03:30] <nahtnam> I want it to check instantly
[00:03:34] <Jattenalle> ah
[00:08:33] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: For some reason its not working!
[00:08:46] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: Let me paste my code. 1 sec
[00:08:51] <Jattenalle> how does your validate() and value() functions look?
[00:09:04] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: http://pastie.org/private/edyvnmedw4kligbqaijusq
[00:09:55] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: validate makes sure its a number
[00:10:06] <nahtnam> and that its only 2 decimal places.
[00:10:17] <nahtnam> Im in the middle of a hackathon and I barely know any JS
[00:10:50] <Jattenalle> what does your html look like?
[00:11:16] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: http://pastie.org/private/b3nhbhvskzbmtbcibxo9g
[00:11:25] <nahtnam> I also make the checks again on the server side
[00:13:36] <Jattenalle> input type="number"
[00:13:54] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: That really looks ugly..
[00:13:55] * Jattenalle shrugs

[00:15:38] <nahtnam> Thanks! :)
[00:15:44] <Jattenalle> :)
[00:21:13] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: One more thing. Do you know how to dynamically change the title?
[00:21:38] <Jattenalle> document.title = 'whatever';
[00:21:45] <nahtnam> Jattenalle: KK. Thanks! :)
[04:29:10] <jop008> is this possible expand an autocomplete field when the list has < 10 items?

[05:09:17] <nahtnam> oops
[06:20:02] <jop008> I have this included <script	src="./include/jquery-ui.js"></script> now my jquery mobile layout is gone for the select boxes
[08:31:18] <Carty> what is the best IRC channel to get help related to making your site work better on mobile devices
[08:36:41] <Carty> I would ask at the #html channel, but you can't post in it, for some bizarre reason
[09:23:41] <pYr0x> someone can help me with my question on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22237707/define-a-target-div-container-for-jquery-ui-tabs
[09:37:20] <BillCriswell> pYr0x: http://jsbin.com/hebotuqu/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:38:08] <pYr0x> what did you change?
[09:38:41] <BillCriswell> I wrapped your code in a div with the id tabs so jQuery UI has somethingt o listen on.
[09:39:01] <BillCriswell> I also hid the direct children of #myInfoTabs
[09:41:18] <pYr0x> ok.. i checked that out
[09:41:22] <pYr0x> thanks
[09:42:04] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[09:42:19] <pYr0x> can i prevend jquery ui to add classes on that container
[09:42:26] <pYr0x> (the wrapping container)
[09:43:32] <BillCriswell> pYr0x: You mean like the ui- classes?
[09:43:38] <pYr0x> yes
[09:44:19] <pYr0x> also on the panel-DIV-container
[09:44:45] <BillCriswell> Do you need jQuery ui for this? Are you using it for anything besides just this tab stuff?
[09:48:15] <pYr0x> i added the ui-classes by my self
[09:48:42] <pYr0x> because if i loaded the website... jquery is to slow and any user will see the list elements
[09:49:12] <pYr0x> and the wrapping div-container is used as a workaround
[09:49:39] <pYr0x> so i would like to add the css classes by my self and the rest should do jquery ui
[09:51:43] <HM_> is it common to be using $()[0] ?
[09:51:56] <HM_> $("something")[0] i mean
[09:52:05] <pYr0x> use eq()
[09:52:46] <BillCriswell> [0] and eq() are almost the same thing, just you could give eq negative indexes.
[09:53:09] <HM_> argh where in the docs is eq
[09:54:13] <HM_> http://api.jquery.com/category/properties/jquery-object-instance-properties/ i was looking here
[09:54:35] <shoky> `api eq
[09:54:35] <b-ot> shoky: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[09:54:40] <BillCriswell> HM_: My mistake actually. .eq(0) would return the first element in the collection as a jquery object, [0] would return the first item as a dom element.
[09:55:04] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/nonovole/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:56:13] <HM_> eq is a filter then
[09:56:49] <Sal> hi anyone here?
[09:57:03] <BillCriswell> HM_: I guess it could be called that.
[09:57:15] <Sal> :)
[09:57:27] <HM_> I'm only just starting with jQuery.
[09:58:26] <HM_> looks like .first() will do the trick as well
[09:58:55] <BillCriswell> HM_: Yes. .first() === .eq(0), .last() === .eq(-1)
[09:59:23] <HM_> yep, and get(0) is the same as [0]
[09:59:45] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:00:04] <Sal> when the user clicks on a table row, i need to add a new row under it with the max colspan and then insert a div inside it containing images and text reguarding the user selected row
[10:00:14] <Sal> what could be the best way to do it?
[10:00:22] <Sal> 1. create html on the fly on every click
[10:00:39] <Sal> 2. have a bottom page already div and then clone it on every click
[10:01:00] <Sal> 3. have a bottom hidden div and move it to different parent on every click
[10:01:04] <Sal> 4. other ideas
[10:01:39] <BillCriswell> Can only one row be shown/expanded/whatever at once?
[10:01:50] <Sal> yes, thats the idea
[10:02:09] <Sal> when user clicks on another row, i have to kill all and redo all under the new clicked row
[10:05:42] <BillCriswell> Sal: I'd probably do like... $information = $('<tr><td colspan="5">Data</td></tr>'); then on click of a tr do like $(this).after($information);
[10:06:32] <BillCriswell> Sal: http://jsbin.com/nonovole/2/edit
[10:07:09] <BillCriswell> Sal: Do you have to modify a lot of information in there?
[10:07:27] <Sal> in the div?
[10:07:51] <Sal> i have 1 title, 1 close button, 2 images and a multiline text
[10:09:00] <Sal> BillCriswell, i'm looking at your code, and its well done
[10:09:15] <Sal> how do you delete the div when the user click on another row?
[10:09:56] <BillCriswell> Sal: I'm moving around the same element since only one has to be visible.
[10:10:12] <Sal> hmmm
[10:10:34] <Sal> and how can i then close it at all?
[10:10:57] <Sal> because the user could clise the div and continue navigating the multipage table
[10:11:02] <Sal> clise=close
[10:12:19] <Sal> i could give the new created tr an id and destroy it on a button click
[10:12:55] <BillCriswell> If you want, or just toggle it if the next() tr is a certain type.
[10:13:26] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/nonovole/3/edit like this?
[10:14:03] <BillCriswell> Er, more readable: http://jsbin.com/nonovole/5/edit?js,output
[10:15:28] <Sal> BillCriswell, could you please put a button inside the new tr and close the tr on its click?
[10:16:14] <Sal> http://jsbin.com/nonovole/6/
[10:16:33] <BillCriswell> Sal: You can do that. $expand.on('click', '.closeButton', function(){ $expand.toggle(); });
[10:16:37] <glitch> I want to find the last instance of the type "input:file", could I do "$(input:file:last)"??
[10:17:05] <BillCriswell> glitch: $('input:file').last() will definitely work... not sure about :file:last
[10:17:15] <glitch> Ok, I'll try it
[10:18:21] <glitch> Only seems to be triggerd by the fist instance of input:file :/
[10:19:06] <glitch> Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/ck5SzviL
[10:22:40] <BillCriswell> glitch: Do console.log( $('input:file') ); and see if it's selecting what you think.
[10:22:49] <glitch> Ok
[10:24:27] <glitch> BillCriswell: Yup, It seems to be selecting what I want
[10:24:59] <glitch> Is there a problem that I add the second input:file with ajax?
[10:26:39] <glitch> I just clone the first input:file on the click of a button and append it with ajax
[10:26:39] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:26:42] <glitch> Oh...
[10:26:52] <BillCriswell> You clone it and append it with ajax?
[10:27:07] <glitch> Yea..
[10:28:03] <BillCriswell> What do you do with the clone?
[10:28:36] <glitch> It stays there, so there will be 2 input:files
[10:29:37] <glitch> I do it something like this "$("#songInfo").clone().appendTo("#songsContainer");"
[10:32:03] <Sal> BillCriswell, i think there's something wrong with the toggle
[10:32:04] <Sal> http://jsbin.com/nonovole/7/edit
[10:32:13] <BillCriswell> glitch: Ok, so you only want to trigger changes on the newest input?
[10:32:17] <Sal> i need to click 2 times to reopen after close by button
[10:32:47] <glitch> BillCriswell: Yes, the newest input:file is the last input:file
[10:34:43] <BillCriswell> Sal: In the else do $expand.show() since it might be hidden after it's inserted.
[10:35:57] <Sal> great works
[10:35:58] <Sal> thanks
[10:37:20] <BillCriswell> Sal: No problem.
[10:38:16] <BillCriswell> glitch: Hmmm...
[10:38:36] <glitch> BillCriswell: This is quite the prediciment
[10:38:49] <BillCriswell> I have a way to do it, but not sure it's the best way.
[10:39:18] <glitch> Any way to do it would be perfect
[10:40:41] <BillCriswell> glitch: http://jsbin.com/naqixufa/1/edit?js,output
[10:41:31] <BillCriswell> glitch: Actually, $(this).is(':last-of-type') could work.
[10:42:59] <glitch> BillCriswell: I'm not quite following
[10:44:03] <BillCriswell> glitch: http://jsbin.com/naqixufa/2/edit
[10:44:30] <BillCriswell> I wonder if this is working accidentally...
[10:44:50] <glitch> lol, it seems to work
[10:46:08] <BillCriswell> glitch: Nope.
[10:46:26] <BillCriswell> Ok I think the first thing defintiely works, but it doesn't feel ideal.
[10:49:04] <glitch> BillCriswell: I can't seem to get the first one to work either
[10:49:53] <glitch> Could I pull this off with classes?
[10:50:15] <glitch> and do "$(".class:last").change()"?
[10:50:17] <BillCriswell> glitch: http://jsbin.com/naqixufa/4/edit?js,output
[10:50:57] <BillCriswell> That wouldn't be any different than just using input:file
[10:52:28] <glitch> BillCriswell: Ok, But I can't seem to get this one to work either
[10:54:13] <glitch> BillCriswell: Sweet! I got it to work
[10:54:16] <glitch> Thanks man!
[10:54:19] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:15:45] <jrockjiggz> hey, i know this might sound like a stretch.. does anyone have a prefered, most lightweight jquery slider?
[13:01:18] <robbue> Dosen't $.support.transform work "out-of-the-box"?
[14:13:54] <damasceno> Hello Guys! I'm using datepicker to show only the available days but the problem is: When I click on the input field it opens the datepicker but it doesn't exclude the days. If I close it or click to see the next month and go back It works. So, the loop (I'm using FOR) is executed after the return (I think). What can I do to fix it? That's my code: http://pastebin.com/vfbAwy3P
[14:16:38] <__joshua__> getDates is async, right?
[14:16:49] <__joshua__> if so, there is the bug
[14:17:08] <damasceno> thanks.
[14:37:49] <RedHatter_> If I set some css using $().css(prop, value) how can I know if the value is invalid? Can I 'catch' an error?
[14:44:38] <bengalo> maybe check if reading the prop afterwards returns undefined
[14:45:53] <RedHatter_> let me try it
[14:47:15] <RedHatter_> bengalo: nope, just returns original value
[14:47:31] <bengalo> so, it accepts and actually sets those bogus values
[14:49:06] <bengalo> well, for me
[14:49:43] <bengalo> if i use $(xx).css('widthhh', 10) -> $(xx).css('widthhh') returns undefined
[14:51:49] <bengalo> i mean, what are you trying to set? you can even check if $(xx).css(yourcheck) returns undefined cuz everything else should be set in some way or another
[14:51:57] <bengalo> and return something else but undefined
[14:52:28] <bengalo> which that i mean before you try to set it
[14:52:30] <bengalo> with
[14:53:07] <RedHatter_> I'm trying $(xx).css("width", "attr(x)") to test if the browser supports the attr() function
[14:53:56] <bengalo> ah
[14:55:01] <RedHatter_> calling css("width") afterward returns the current width of the element
[14:55:09] <RedHatter_> So that's no help
[14:55:21] <bengalo> why not?
[14:55:25] <bengalo> store it before you try to set
[14:55:30] <bengalo> and check if its the same
[14:55:51] <bengalo> dunno how internal works but it probably wont set width to undefined but rather not accept the "request" of setting it to a value unknown
[14:56:36] <__joshua__> read the width, add 1, write the width with attr, read the width.
[14:56:37] <RedHatter_> oh, yeah duh
[14:56:59] <RedHatter_> I don't know why I didn't think of that
[14:57:32] <RedHatter_> guess I was too focused on detecting an 'error'
[14:57:50] <bengalo> yeah
[14:58:31] <bengalo> never actually worked with attr in css myself so far
[14:58:39] <bengalo> but looks interesting
[15:00:12] <RedHatter_> It sounds useful, but has very little browser support so far
[15:08:29] <__joshua__> little?  chrome 2+ ie 8+
[15:08:40] <__joshua__> firefox 1+
[15:09:18] <jrockjiggz> $('el').on('hover', function(){ console.log('hover'); }); isn't working???
[15:09:34] <__joshua__> also, usage on properties other than content and without strings is basically nil
[15:10:03] <__joshua__> it probably is, jrockjiggz?
[15:10:12] <jrockjiggz> yea it looks right.. must be something
[15:10:23] <__joshua__> 'el' isn't a selector?
[15:10:36] <jrockjiggz> $('.gridMenu img')
[15:10:54] <__joshua__>  $('.gridMenu img').length = ?
[15:11:48] <jrockjiggz> 7
[15:13:16] <__joshua__> event is actually mouseenter? mabye
[15:13:31] <jrockjiggz> yes!
[15:13:31] <__joshua__> $(blah).hover(enter, exit)
[15:13:37] <jrockjiggz> mousever works.. not 'hover'
[15:13:42] <jrockjiggz> *mouseenter
[15:14:06] <jrockjiggz> thats why.. lol.. ty
[15:21:48] <sunbeam> how can I really make sure, that some jquery code gets executed as final thing on a page?

[15:42:44] <shoky> what browser are you on
[15:42:44] <pyed> shoky: thanks for confirming that it's working for you, I should do some more testing.
[15:43:07] <pyed> safari, never tried chrome, i'll do now
[15:45:08] <shoky> xboi209: read about throttling/debouncing
[15:46:39] <shoky> xboi209: you can write your own or use some library's throttle like underscore's or ben alman's plugin
[15:52:32] <pyed> shoky: it's working for me in JSfiddle but when I try to run it via greasemonkey like plugins I'll get "Can't find variable: jQuery18107854276304133236_1394404507719"

[15:56:55] <in_deep_thought> often I see large amounts of jquery all wrapped in a $(function() {//code here}); type of this like this: http://pastebin.com/8tf8GhQV. wouldn't this just define the function but not execute it?

[16:03:05] <xboi209> shoky: you still here?
[16:03:31] <in_deep_thought> but so isn't the $() format just basic jquery identification? would that just mean that $(function) is identifying a function to use jquery on?

[17:39:45] <jrockjiggz_PC> how to append html and then select it?
[18:56:45] <fiveofoh> I'm working on a project with lots of jQuery UI range sliders, and have made a couple modifications to the interaction: a) Click/dragging between sliders moves the whole selection around, b) Clicking/dragging far away from a handle starts a new range, instead of just moving one handle
[18:56:55] <fiveofoh> Thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/cincodenada/8CG8V/2/
[18:59:08] <fiveofoh> Still some refinement/option-making to do if I were to do a PR, but the changes make my use case much nicer
