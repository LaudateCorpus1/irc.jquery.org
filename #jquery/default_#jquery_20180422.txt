[03:53:33] <ismithers> What is the simplest way to load some HTML and inject it in to an element on the page? I am trying $('#test_load').load('my_file.html'); and whilst it works, it prevents the rest of the content on the page from displaying.
[04:04:11] <ryan_ford> what do you mean it prevents the rest of it?
[04:04:20] <ryan_ford> while it's loading? or completely?
[04:07:05] <ryan_ford> load should run async, so it shouldn't prevent anything else from loading
[05:02:31] <sine0> how can i target an element within a div that has a unique class
[05:02:53] <sine0> <div class="im-unique"><p>i need changing</p></div>
[05:03:53] <sine0> .children woot
[06:44:06] <ismithers> ryan_ford: I have a page with a bunch of HTML, an element towards the top of the page has some HTML injected via .load(); and if I trigger that all the HTML below doesn't appear, and isn't in the DOM when I inspect it.
[06:44:17] <ismithers> Sorry I was away for munchies, just got back to this now.
[06:47:17] <ryan_ford> is it there visually?
[06:47:29] <ismithers> Nope
[06:47:45] <ryan_ford> are you sure you're not overwriting the hard coded html?
[06:48:01] <ismithers> Well, I don't _think_ so. But I guess anything goes. I will double-check.
[06:50:41] <ismithers> Found it. I had a double <p> rather than a <p></p> and that was breaking it.
[06:50:54] <ryan_ford> üéâ
[06:53:53] <ismithers> I can't tell if that's a carrot or an ice-cream.
[06:53:58] <ismithers> Either way, I'll take it!
[06:55:31] <ryan_ford> it's a party popper
[06:55:44] <ryan_ford> üéä
[06:56:32] <ismithers> An elephant! I love elephants!
[06:56:57] <ryan_ford> üêò
[06:57:28] <ismithers> Seems you are quite proficient in this game...
[06:57:36] <ismithers> My final challenge, a step-ladder!
[06:58:17] <ryan_ford> out of stock
[06:59:19] <ismithers> lol
[07:02:11] <Woet> üìö
[07:03:41] <ismithers> Lockers?
[07:03:58] <ryan_ford> stack of books
[07:04:26] <ismithers> Looks like lockers, that have been knocked during a zombie apocalypse.
[07:04:33] <ryan_ford> üóÑ
[07:06:10] <ryan_ford> what's in a modern jQ stack?
[07:06:43] <ryan_ford> like if you wanted to start a new project with jQ in 2018
[07:08:30] <ryan_ford> seems like conceptually it wouldn't play very nice with most frontend frameworks
[07:22:14] <ryan_ford> maybe I should take the silence to mean people just don't start jquery projects in 2018 üòÇ
[07:53:24] <Woet> ryan_ford: what's a jquery "stack"?
[07:53:27] <Woet> i just use jquery and thats it
[08:18:06] <ryan_ford> I don't know, maybe like a browser combatability focused set of tech?
[08:19:45] <ryan_ford> you don't have like a goto set of libs and stuff you use?
[08:27:11] <ryan_ford> i see a lot of stuff with like jquery + backbone, but looks like bb is pretty well dead, largely unmaintained, or maybe knockout
[10:03:45] <ryan_ford> oh man, so dumb, figured out my promise issues from the other day
[10:04:34] <ryan_ford> i couldn't figure out why I couldn't mutate the value being passed in a promise chain. i was using .done() in place of .then() thinking they were interchangeable üôà
[13:38:49] <steelbull> Hi, anybody for small help?

[14:17:52] <toothfai1y_> Would appreciate if someone could help me on how to make this link clickable> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/OZywNe
[14:22:28] <shoky> toothfai1y_: give it a position, e.g. absolute or relative
[14:23:17] <konrados> toothfai1y_: like this: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VxvBWV ?
[14:23:25] <konrados> ah, misunderstood the question, nvm

[17:15:55] <jak2000> hi all!
[17:15:59] <jak2000> good afternoon
[17:35:26] <ritmo2k> I need a component that allows a user to accumulate multiple choices where I offer a select and a text box. The idea is you choose a select option and enter the text associated with it, one or more times. Something like that exist?
[18:32:42] <WebStudent> Someone could help me ? I'm a fresh new webstudent and I've to change a file in  vanilla JS to Jquery and it's hard
[18:33:33] <Woet> WebStudent: https://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc/
[20:20:47] <WebStudent> Someone know how to transform this https://pastebin.com/ghQs8Hqp in JQUERY Please ?
[20:28:50] <pavonia> What part are you having problems with?
[20:34:55] <WebStudent> I'm just trying to understand the JS code and I'm lost when I try something it's always wrong
[20:38:36] <pavonia> That's very unspecific which makes helping difficult
[20:41:31] <WebStudent> I know and I understand it's just when I'm trying to change one line or function JS to Jquery my webpage didn't work I'll continue to try
[20:43:59] <pavonia> It's probably better to start from scratch with the JQuery version, adding more and more code incrementally
[23:46:09] <dw1> why would $('#user_table tbody').on('click','td'.. work but not $('#user_table tbody td').on('click', function()..
[23:53:53] <nick1> http://dpaste.com/3T6RF3Q Uncaught TypeError: $.post is not a function
[23:54:01] <nick1> assuming i'm missing something basic here - any ideas?
