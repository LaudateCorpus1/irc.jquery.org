[03:56:15] <thierry> Hello guys
[03:56:20] <thierry> I am facing a jqm issue.
[03:56:35] <thierry> I have two datepicker(start and end) in my page(jquery page) which are display when i click on div tag "DÃ©part le" or "Retour le".
[03:56:39] <thierry> Only one datepicker is display at a time.
[03:56:43] <thierry> So after my click jqm append to my url the id of my page which is (#search-date), datepicker is display
[03:56:47] <thierry> So let say my url become "www.jQM-Pages.html?id=10#search-date". My base url is ""www.jQM-Pages.html?id=10"
[03:56:52] <thierry> There i have 2 datepicker display. I notice this is due to the parameter "?id=10"
[03:56:57] <thierry> Do somebody know why i'm getting my 2 datepicker display because of "?id=10" ?
[03:57:28] <thierry> i have a code on jsfiddle if it can help
[03:57:29] <thierry> https://jsfiddle.net/x4wo2yrk/3/
[03:59:23] <thierry> ooh i think i get it
[03:59:50] <thierry> by changing my url to www.jQM-Pages.html#search-date?id=10
[03:59:54] <thierry> it works
[06:42:24] <Neo_122> hi guys , who know how change direction in plugin bxSlider ?
[06:42:38] <Neo_122> rtl
[06:42:58] <Neo_122> that slider appears from left to right, I need form right to left
[06:43:02] <Neo_122> is there anybody ?
[08:46:30] <Neo_122> who is there /
[08:46:32] <Neo_122> ?
[09:42:46] <RenokK> @Neo_123, first of all, this is jQuery, not some wierd Plugin Support. And not even really support. Second, people answer you when they know it, or have time. Third: 3 Seconds of google --> .bx-wrapper .bx-viewport{ direction: ltr; }
[09:45:34] <thierry> hi guys
[09:45:51] <thierry> i need some help on jqm $.mobile.changePage
[09:46:02] <thierry> The pageshow, pagehide, etc events typically have a signature like:
[09:46:08] <thierry> function(event, data){}
[09:46:24] <thierry> But there doesn't seem to be any way to pass information from $.mobile.changePage into that data parameter.
[09:46:38] <thierry> The keys in the data parameter seem to be fixed - you can't add your own keys from what I can see.
[09:46:42] <thierry> I often want to be able to do this:
[09:46:48] <thierry> $myPage.on('pageshow', function(event, data){
[09:46:58] <thierry>                   console.log(data.message);
[09:47:04] <thierry> });
[09:47:14] <thierry> $.mobile.changePage($myPage, {message: "my message"});
[09:48:55] <thierry> guys do you know how do handle this
[09:48:57] <thierry> ?
[10:37:05] <Es0teric> so if i am on an ajaxComplete method, how do i target a specific action within an object thats returned? for instance, i have something like this $(document).ajaxComplete(function( event, xhr, options ) { }) but the action is in options... options.action returns undefined even though the object has it -- how do i get the actual action from the options itself?
[11:15:33] <Cork> Es0teric: do console.log(Object.keys(options)) and check what keys you have
[11:15:46] <Es0teric> Cork already figured it out
[11:15:51] * hlve slaps Es0teric with a trout.
[11:15:55] <Es0teric> lol
[11:15:55] <hlve> Cork is god.
[11:16:44] <hlve> On a random thought, there's a hip hop artist from Boston named Esoteric... who is absolutely fantastic
[11:17:15] <Es0teric> hlve hes part of Army Of The Pharaohs
[11:17:28] <Es0teric> affiliated with Jedi Mind Tricks
[11:17:37] <Es0teric> 7L & Esoteric
[11:17:39] <hlve> Yep
[11:17:40] <hlve> ;)
[11:17:52] <hlve> Awesome artist.
[11:17:54] <Es0teric> my name is actually loosely off that
[11:18:04] <Es0teric> but Celph Titled is one of my favs from that group
[11:18:27] <hlve> I think he's from Boston. I might be wrong.
[11:18:43] <taplar> the devils basement
[11:19:04] <hlve> Mines based off of an old hardcore band. and then it mished and mixed in letters.
[11:19:05] * hlve shrugs
[11:21:19] * hlve is now listening to: Celph Titled, Buckwild - Buck's Four Course Meal
[11:21:24] <hlve> in honor of you.
[12:31:17] <codecutter> i'm trying sort an array of objects based on one of its properties - https://jsfiddle.net/0pnnsnya/
[12:36:01] <taplar> ok?  what's the problem?
[12:36:53] <codecutter> try changing the param to 'loss' sorter('loss');
[12:37:41] <codecutter> lowest value should be at top, right?
[12:39:02] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0pnnsnya/1/
[12:39:08] <taplar> "" isn't a float value
[12:39:13] <taplar> you have to handle for htat
[12:40:32] <codecutter> ok
[15:22:56] <czabel> I'm trying to build a dynamic selector, and I can't get it to work: https://jsfiddle.net/fxk7xcpq/
[15:23:28] <czabel> I want to select a certain option, but I get "jquery.min.js:2 Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #product-list-select option:value="pid2" "

[15:30:17] <czabel> Whoa, totally different. Okay, thank you!
[15:30:27] <czabel> Thank you for the link as well
[15:40:15] <quechon> hello guys im a beginner i know basic javascript enough to make things work but i most of the time use jquery but i have read a lot of pleople saying that is not good idea to just use jquery i would like to know since you guys use jquery how often should it be used thanks
[15:41:41] <taplar> it really depends
[15:42:07] <taplar> jquery is there to fill in the gaps between different browsers, and different browser versions
[15:42:40] <taplar> depending upon what browser support you have to write for, it can give you reasons not to use jquery if the logic exists natively
[15:43:02] <quechon> im not supporting old browsers
[15:43:20] <taplar> then there is also the concern for businesses.
[15:43:37] <quechon> what you mean
[15:43:46] <taplar> there may be businesses where the majority of their devs know jquery but are not that familiar with vanilla, or are more comfortable staying in jquery land
[15:44:08] <taplar> in which case it would be a team decision to use either/or more so than the other
[15:44:58] <quechon> how about performance
[15:45:19] <taplar> its like any library really.  use it poorly and it will perform poorly
[15:46:05] <taplar> which is also another consideration
[15:46:17] <quechon> i see i guess i have some reading to do on how to properly use jquery then
[15:47:12] <quechon> but thanks for the replies very helpful
[15:47:18] <taplar> it should also be a consideration if you are using any frameworks in your application
[15:47:48] <taplar> frameworks like angular, react, vue, etc.  they have their own approach to handling some of the things jquery does
[15:48:10] <taplar> in which case i'd suggest users should try to use those instead of intermixing jquery with the framework.
[16:01:04] <quechon> taplar: i just use jquery
[16:02:54] <taplar> its cool
[16:34:30] <bjsnider> do i need to escape square braces if i'm trying to select an id?
[16:35:00] <duch_kazatel> are they apart of the ID?
[16:35:39] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider
[16:35:58] <bjsnider> yes they are
[16:36:05] <robertmaxrees> https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/css-escapes
[16:36:59] <robertmaxrees> also: https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ - To use any of the meta-characters ( such as  !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ ) as a literal part of a name, it must be escaped with with two backslashes: \\
[16:37:49] <bjsnider> i'm just trying to establish if that's why i'm failing to successfully select the thing
[16:38:12] <taplar> [] in a selector are considered an attribute selector syntax
[16:38:23] <taplar> if not escaped
[16:38:25] <robertmaxrees> right, hence my paste from the selectors page.
[16:56:34] <bjsnider> i need to test if a data attribute is an empty string, eg. ""
[16:57:36] <bjsnider> also, $this.val("") would change the value to nothing, right?
[17:01:03] <Darren_> https://pastebin.com/M42np1Cj I got this javascript from https://codepen.io/drewhaas/pen/dGKQXp and I have it working here http://www.ankitdesigns.com/demo/ncbc/testimonials/ but the moment you go to the homepage the page is all blank, but if I comment out the entire script it loads fine. What in the js is causing this?
[17:01:42] <taplar> val() changes the value="", not a data attribute
[17:03:33] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ open your console.
[17:03:38] <robertmaxrees> "$(...).position(...) is undefined[Learn More]"
[17:03:41] <taplar> lmao, i was just about to type that
[17:03:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:03:57] <robertmaxrees> that error is likely causing your problems.
[17:05:49] <Darren_> ah, probably yes, damn this is tricky, sorry for not checking that
[17:05:54] <robertmaxrees> It's all good.
[17:05:57] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:06:09] <relipse__> Is there an event AFTER $(document).ready(.
[17:06:57] <relipse__> I have some jquery ui elements that seem to get loaded afterward
[17:07:10] <taplar> load happens after ready
[17:07:22] <robertmaxrees> relipse__ there's a window load.  but document ready can misfire early if the markup is invalid.
[17:09:29] <Darren_> robertmaxrees I'm not too knowledgable with js, I could either find a different animation or try to figure this out, what would I need to look up to figure out a solution?
[17:09:56] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ so what does that error imply to you?
[17:10:35] <Darren_> that it can't find 'left' because the item doesn't appear in the menu
[17:10:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:10:50] <robertmaxrees> so - .css("left", $(".current_page_item .nav-item-child").position().left)
[17:11:07] <robertmaxrees> if that line is the one that's erroring, what should you do?
[17:11:25] <robertmaxrees> or .data("origLeft", $magicLine.position().left)
[17:12:17] <Darren_> it has to somehow say "if the page doesn't exist, still work", but im not sure in js how ot say that, like to ignore pages not in the nav
[17:12:49] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want to run any of this if the particular element doesn't exist?
[17:12:59] <Darren_> well i do
[17:13:15] <robertmaxrees> so what should it do instead of that element doesn't exist?
[17:13:34] <robertmaxrees> *instead if that
[17:15:55] <Darren_> if it doesnt exist then there is no '.current_page_item' so it should appear on hover...as I type this, and based on the animation, i guess that doesnt make sense
[17:16:00] <Darren_> because it slides from item to item
[17:16:16] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:16:20] <Darren_> and if an item doesnt iexist it doesnt make sense
[17:16:41] <Darren_> i guess this animation works better on a single page website
[17:17:04] <robertmaxrees> you could just check to see if the element exists and then decide how you want to handle it from there.
[17:22:20] <Darren_> so something like if ($el.length == 0)?
[17:22:55] <robertmaxrees> you could just do if (!$el.length) {
[17:23:00] <robertmaxrees> or do $el.length === 0
[17:23:09] <robertmaxrees> avoid == when you can.
[17:23:30] <robertmaxrees> (which is most of the time btw ;) )
[17:23:40] <Darren_> where would i put that in my code, does it matter?
[17:24:13] <robertmaxrees> gotta figure out what you want to do in the case that it doesn't exist.
[17:25:06] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you set a whole bunmch of stuff up and then bind a hover.  if $(".current_page_item .nav-item-child") or $magicLine. don't exist, do you want any of this to run on that page?
[17:25:16] <Darren_> use the 'left' of the first menu item regardless if it's active
[17:25:46] <robertmaxrees> so then maybe your selector is bad and you need to change it
[17:25:49] <Darren_> but $magicLine would appear only on hover
[17:26:08] <robertmaxrees> "appear" and "exists" are totally different btw :)
[18:34:22] <bjsnider> got tripped up by a lack of event.preventdefault again. this is why people have post-it notes all over their monitors
[18:36:37] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[18:38:04] <bjsnider> i'm writing good code, finding 5 different ways fo doing the same thing, and nothing works
[20:26:17] <DelphiWorld> hey everyone
[20:26:31] <DelphiWorld> is there an easy way to test if a string contain "true" or "false"?
[20:31:01] <snover> DelphiWorld: what have you tried?
[20:32:28] <DelphiWorld> Snakes: if s="true" {... } but is not matching
[20:32:36] <DelphiWorld> snover:  if s="true" {... } but is not matching
[20:37:58] <DelphiWorld> snover ?
[21:39:02] <zampa> So i am using bootstrap nav tabs (and a drop down menu and i created an eventlistener for $('#gameframe-content .nav-tabs li').on('click', 'a', function(e) { the problem is... when i select something in the dropdown the eventlistener is triggered twice.
[21:44:52] <zampa> I just dont get why its called twice...
[21:44:58] <zampa> Its not like i create the event listener twice.
