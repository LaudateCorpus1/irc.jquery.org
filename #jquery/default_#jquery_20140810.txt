[01:47:18] <kirua> hi
[01:50:00] <zereraz> hello everyone , I made a simple slider menu using animate function, mouseenter then slider out , mouseleave then slide in. The problem I am facing is that if the mouse moves too fast in the menu it automatically slides it in(mouseleave) even when the mouse was still in the menu.
[01:52:53] <zereraz> ?
[01:56:20] <zereraz> help!
[02:10:59] <wa5ted> zereraz: give me a sec
[02:11:04] <wa5ted> still trying to understand what you wanna do
[02:11:13] <wa5ted> btw might be advised to make an example fiddle
[02:11:18] <wa5ted> kirua: hi
[02:12:01] <wa5ted> zereraz: could you do a jsfiddle to confirm in my mind what you are trying to do
[02:12:13] <zereraz> ok I'll try
[02:12:17] <wa5ted> i think i have a solution but want to be sure whats in my head is what you need help with
[02:14:05] <zereraz> http://jsfiddle.net/h2y3c3ju/
[02:14:12] <zereraz> Its working on fiddle
[02:14:17] <zereraz> what the hell
[02:16:52] <zereraz> like if you move the mouse in my website then the slider quickly hides
[02:17:07] <zereraz> in fiddle move your mouse fast inside the menu nothing happens
[02:18:17] <zereraz> is it because there are allot of elements behind the menu on my website that makes it think the mouse is out
[02:19:44] <zereraz> wa5ted: what do you think?
[02:20:14] <wa5ted> it disappeared for me
[02:20:25] <wa5ted> possibly
[02:20:54] <wa5ted> zereraz: im gettig weird behavious where it disappears alotgether
[02:21:46] <zereraz> wa5ted: Yeah that is because the mouseenter is slow, so if your mouse if leaves before it opens up then it does a mouse leave which does -150px
[02:22:03] <zereraz> wa5ted: I meant my animate for mouseenter is slow.
[02:22:22] <wa5ted> hmmm
[02:22:28] <wa5ted> that should be regular paced
[02:22:31] <wa5ted> thats weird
[02:22:47] <wa5ted> i was asumming somethign really different
[02:22:51] <wa5ted> di check load times
[02:22:55] <wa5ted> although wait no
[02:22:57] <wa5ted> thats not it
[02:23:02] <wa5ted> is the animation itself slow
[02:23:07] <wa5ted> wait
[02:23:09] <wa5ted> what the fuck
[02:23:16] <wa5ted> why are you opening amenu using .animate
[02:23:21] <zereraz> http://jsfiddle.net/h2y3c3ju/1/
[02:23:27] <wa5ted> oh cause  of .stop
[02:23:41] <wa5ted> it disappeared on me again XD
[02:23:55] <wa5ted> when that happens
[02:23:58] <wa5ted> you sohuld have a reset
[02:24:09] <wa5ted> where 4 seconds after it disapears it resets
[02:24:33] <zereraz> wa5ted: yeah I'll create a check if the width is -ve them make it resetr
[02:24:36] <zereraz> reset
[02:24:47] <zereraz> check the new version
[02:24:54] <zereraz> its bigger so does not disappear
[02:25:07] <zereraz> lol, it does if you enter from left
[02:25:32] <wa5ted> its still disappearingXD
[02:25:37] <wa5ted> true true
[02:25:42] <zereraz> http://jsfiddle.net/h2y3c3ju/1/
[02:25:44] <zereraz> now it does not
[02:25:57] <zereraz> sorry this http://jsfiddle.net/h2y3c3ju/3/
[02:26:16] <zereraz> wa5ted: it still does if I move too fast :(
[02:26:17] <wa5ted> sorry to burst your solution it still does
[02:26:21] <wa5ted> yeah
[02:26:24] <wa5ted> which is not ideal
[02:26:28] <zereraz> yeah
[02:26:28] <wa5ted> its a fixed bar right?
[02:26:35] <wa5ted> one that moves with the window?
[02:26:36] <zereraz> I will fix it
[02:26:38] <zereraz> yes
[02:26:43] <wa5ted> its fixed the the window
[02:26:46] <wa5ted> NOT document
[02:26:53] <wa5ted> fixed to the*
[02:26:55] <wa5ted> if so
[02:26:58] <wa5ted> use position fixed
[02:27:16] <zereraz> I used that
[02:27:20] <zereraz> still disappears
[02:27:40] <zereraz> I think I should remove the -= 150
[02:27:45] <zereraz> and make it 50
[02:27:54] <zereraz> and +=150 to 200
[02:28:20] <zereraz> http://jsfiddle.net/h2y3c3ju/4/
[02:28:29] <zereraz> this cannot hide
[02:29:00] <zereraz> now we comeback to my problem
[02:29:47] <wa5ted> which is
[02:29:49] <wa5ted> again remind me
[02:30:32] <zereraz> wa5ted: so I have figured the problem , there is another div that gets hidden behind when the menu oepsn
[02:30:33] <zereraz> opens*
[02:30:54] <zereraz> when the mouse enters that div(that is behind the now open menu) it triggers a mouse leave event
[02:31:04] <wa5ted> ahhh
[02:31:10] <wa5ted> btw
[02:31:15] <wa5ted> here is a better way of doing it
[02:31:16] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/h2y3c3ju/6/
[02:31:18] <wa5ted> no js
[02:31:19] <wa5ted> all css
[02:31:43] <zereraz> wa5ted: will it be affected by that div?
[02:31:50] <wa5ted> dunno
[02:31:54] <wa5ted> try it  out ;)
[02:31:55] <zereraz> ok let me try
[02:32:07] <wa5ted> your problem will still be there imo
[02:32:12] <wa5ted> thats just a better way of doing it
[02:32:16] <wa5ted> js is slow compared to css
[02:34:54] <zereraz> wa5ted: problem still persists
[02:35:03] <zereraz> wa5ted: thanks for the css btw
[02:35:40] <paule32> hello
[02:35:50] <paule32> i have code: function WEBUIManager() { /* ... */ }  $.webUImanager = new WEBUIManager();
[02:35:57] <wa5ted> zereraz: i really dont know
[02:36:09] <paule32> but when i look in browser console, $.webUImanager is undefined
[02:36:09] <wa5ted> it could be because of the layers
[02:36:13] <paule32> when i use: $.webUImanager.test();
[02:36:18] <paule32> what can i do to fix this?
[02:36:18] <wa5ted> paule32: are you fucking kidding me
[02:36:44] <zereraz> wa5ted: ok no problem , that div is not that important
[02:36:46] <wa5ted> like seriously
[02:36:47] <zereraz> wa5ted: thanks
[02:37:04] <wa5ted> zereraz: you command the behaviour not teh brwoser
[02:37:09] <wa5ted> if you say its not important
[02:37:12] <wa5ted> make it important
[02:37:13] <wa5ted> XD
[02:37:19] <wa5ted> paule32: but seriously
[02:37:28] <wa5ted> are you fucking kidding me
[02:37:48] <paule32> how are you
[02:38:01] <wa5ted> i already told you what to look for
[02:38:38] <paule32> i go to bed, and i look new at the moment
[02:38:38] <wa5ted> paule32: find out where the script from which $.webUImanager is being called exists
[02:38:43] <wa5ted> its like if you dont ahve jquery loaded
[02:38:46] <wa5ted> it will say
[02:38:49] <wa5ted> $ is undefined
[02:39:59] <wa5ted> paule32:  so look tosee if those files exist
[02:40:10] <wa5ted> and also that they are getting called (the library its self)
[02:40:16] <wa5ted> *before* you call it
[02:42:41] <paule32> http://codepad.org/fIyoAsgs
[02:48:11] <paule32> ah ok
[02:48:41] <paule32> i look to source "element observer" from firefox
[02:49:01] <paule32> the including file list seems to be important
[02:49:18] <paule32> thanks for the hint
[02:52:19] <wa5ted> sure....
[02:52:27] <wa5ted> next time listen when i tell you the firs ttime
[02:52:31] <wa5ted> the nyou wouldnt have to ask again
[02:52:36] <wa5ted> if something is undefined
[02:52:37] <wa5ted> its
[02:52:40] <wa5ted> *undefined*
[03:30:31] <xenaxon> hi. how can I invert camera trackball controls in three.js
[03:30:32] <xenaxon> ?
[03:37:25] <heedypo> 'quit
[03:47:06] <rajlaksh> anyone help me?
[03:47:08] <rajlaksh> http://pastebin.com/m2eAbbff
[03:52:50] <rajlaksh> how to get json data?
[03:55:26] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: data.parseJSON() ?
[03:55:40] <rajlaksh> okay
[03:55:46] <rajlaksh> trying
[03:55:50] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: i am not sure, but by logic it should return object.I am still noob :D
[03:56:00] <rajlaksh> oh
[03:56:11] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: JSON - JS Object Notation
[03:56:24] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: then data after parse would be object
[03:56:30] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: by logic ;)
[03:58:10] <rajlaksh> data.parseJSON is not a Function
[03:58:26] <rajlaksh> Current i get object object
[03:59:08] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: @_@ object object object :D
[03:59:28] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: is it,but i am not sure....
[03:59:42] <rajlaksh> okay :)
[04:00:17] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: you could write function i guess, which print each object in json
[04:00:23] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: in your json*
[04:00:38] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: and after tried call it with data as argument
[04:00:46] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: just for test :D
[04:01:57] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: probabily, you need in that http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/key-concepts/
[04:02:08] <rajlaksh> My Json print data like [{}]
[04:02:16] <AlexRussia> @_@
[04:02:30] <AlexRussia> it seems like array which have one object :D
[04:03:22] <rajlaksh> Its Jquery ToolTip code
[04:03:37] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: hm, >As of jQuery 1.4, if the JSON data sent by your server isn't properly formatted, the request may fail silently. See http://json.org for details on properly formatting JSON, but as a general rule, use built-in language methods for generating JSON on the server to avoid syntax issues.
[04:03:59] <rajlaksh> Json is Okay
[04:04:10] <rajlaksh> There is no Error
[04:04:27] <rajlaksh> Its created by php
[04:05:47] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: here nice example http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[04:06:01] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: i am use RoR usually, PHP is not my favorite language....
[04:07:06] <rajlaksh> okay
[04:08:09] <AlexRussia> yo, guys, i have request to api site: make links to code examples, it could be useful for send to guys like rajlaksh
[04:09:55] <rajlaksh> @AlexRussia that http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ tutorial does not work
[04:10:06] <rajlaksh> no Console log
[04:10:06] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: @_@
[04:10:10] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: ah
[04:10:14] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: is no console
[04:10:25] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: it should append data to your page
[04:10:32] <rajlaksh> console.log( "success" );
[04:10:41] <rajlaksh> success does not show
[04:10:55] <AlexRussia> lol
[04:11:29] <rajlaksh> But alert working superb
[04:21:46] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: i am success with first example
[04:22:17] <AlexRussia> rajlaksh: it works
[04:22:26] <rajlaksh> oh
[04:23:30] <rajlaksh> But console.log not working for me

[04:36:50] <fattest> I'm trying to add a show hide function for each of my rows for my table. I want to click on each row, and text shoud appear BELOW the text: "show/hide" (currently it's above). I also want it to take up all row's width, not just one of the <td> http://imgur.com/8PkcbzB how can I achieve this? http://jsbin.com/necuz/1/edit
[04:46:00] <fattest> any help please
[04:49:00] <clarkk> fattest: it would help if your code wasn't such a mess :/
[04:49:09] <fattest> sorry clarkk
[04:49:21] <clarkk> you need to sort that out
[04:49:49] <clarkk> I don't use jsbin, but jsfiddle has a tidyup button
[04:56:32] <fattest> clarkk: http://jsfiddle.net/oca1j3vL/3/
[04:56:54] <fattest> better?
[04:57:11] <clarkk> why didn't you just click the tidyup button? :p
[04:57:38] <clarkk> you need to include jquery on the left
[04:57:59] <fattest> clarkk: its in the external resources for jquery
[04:58:13] <clarkk> ah ok, good stuff :)
[04:58:46] <clarkk> so the layout issues you have surely will be css related, won't it, fattest?
[04:59:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> does anyone know how the MIN and MAX rules are syntaxed here: http://verifyjs.com/#included-rules
[04:59:15] <fattest> clarkk: i think so
[04:59:27] <clarkk> fattest: so that's off topic here, I'm afraid
[04:59:49] <clarkk> I'm looking at the jquery element of your question now
[04:59:50] <fattest> clarkk: the additional content takes up only one of the column; i want it to go through all of it
[05:00:01] <fattest> its not css problem
[05:00:16] <clarkk> fattest: but that's an html/css question
[05:00:37] <fattest> oh
[05:00:44] <fattest> which channel should i join
[05:00:49] <clarkk> try #css or #html
[05:01:02] <fattest> ok
[05:01:04] <fattest> thanks
[05:01:42] <clarkk> fattest: the js part seems to be working fine, doesn't it?
[05:02:01] <fattest> clarkk: i want the show hide button to be above the additional content
[05:02:14] <fattest> so the additional content comes under the "show/hide" text
[05:03:01] <clarkk> fattest: get your page looking correct, before you introduce any javascript. So design it with everything shown, then introduce js and hide the bits that you want hidden onLoad
[05:03:26] <fattest> ok
[05:04:12] <clarkk> I've amended my code, to make it closer to the demo, but it's still not working. Can anyone help, please?  http://jsfiddle.net/opx8vv9d/4/
[05:05:05] <fattest> clarkk: thought you knew jquery
[05:06:02] <clarkk> fattest: are you able to help, or not?
[05:06:20] <fattest> clarkk: sorry, i'm not that good with jquery

[07:12:09] <jop008> $(document).ready(function() {   $("#insert_mm_couple").on("click", function(e) { is not triggerd the element button is present
[07:16:45] <jop008> click event on <a is this the same as a div click?
[07:19:42] <BillCriswell> jop008: Yeah. You'd have to do e.preventDefault() to keep the link from following, though.
[07:29:42] <no_gravity> Hello! Can I apply a click handler to multiple elements with $(".someclass").on("click",myfunction)? Is .on the best way to do it these days?

[08:06:51] <Rickky> Do I need any dependencies for using animations? I try to animate the removal and adding of a class to get a slidetoggle effect. The class is removed and my div expands, but it isn't animated
[08:07:10] <Rickky> Tried both with slideotoggle(), animate() as with css transitions but nothing seems to smoothly expand my div
[08:10:48] <jop008> typo removed
[08:10:54] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/Lqy86dc6/19/ but problem remains
[08:15:28] <no_gravity> jop008: several issues
[08:16:02] <jop008> I solved them thx anyway
[08:22:41] <jq-> What's the best way to get text in a div while preserving whitespace and linebreaks?
[08:23:01] <jq-> While also being cross browser compatible ^
[08:35:08] <jop008> how to swithc this to no? http://jsfiddle.net/Lqy86dc6/22/
[08:40:54] <systemfault> jop008:
[08:40:55] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/Lqy86dc6/26/
[08:41:11] <systemfault> I used a setTimeout so you can see the result in 3 seconds,
[08:42:14] <jop008> yes I see testing it looks super
[08:46:08] <firebird1> why need to compress js file ?
[08:47:40] <frank_o> Hi! Anyone know what's up with the delay between hover and SVG animation start? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xgjpL3bg/
[08:47:43] <frank_o> The SVG also flickers for like a millisecond before it disappears and reappears to complete the animation.
[08:47:57] <frank_o> firebird1: I think speed
[08:48:52] <firebird1> frank_o, i have around 200 lines after compress it got reduced ab  200 ms how is tht?
[08:49:17] <dmsuperman> firebird1: compressing the file makes the request smaller which reduces overhead for both server and client
[08:50:49] <jenia> hello. is it possible to somehow reuse mobile-jquery's "loading animation"? you know where the wheel spins in the middle of the screen when an ajax request is loading?
[08:57:59] <ggherdov> does anybody have an opinion on "jquery in action" from manning? http://www.manning.com/derosa/ one of the author is well known (yehuda katz)
[08:58:37] <ggherdov> looking for a zero-to-hero book.
[08:59:02] * ggherdov well, zero-to-zero-dot-five would do as well
[08:59:39] <systemfault> Usually, my opinion is that books don’t work for jQuery because they’re usually outdated. But for this one, it might just do the trick since it’s a MEAP
[09:00:17] <systemfault> ggherdov: I’d probably take the chance and buy it if I was looking for a jQuery book
[09:00:40] <systemfault> ggherdov: Not interested in online books?
[09:00:41] <ggherdov> systemfault: yup
[09:01:01] <ggherdov> sure, online books are good. any link you suggest ?
[09:02:17] <systemfault> Perhaps http://jqfundamentals.com/
[09:03:48] <ggherdov> thanks systemfault

I was able to get the smart wizard running easily by using the wp_register_script and wp_enqueue_script, but I am banging my head against the wall with this uploader.
[09:31:15] <GoWingsGo> I have been able to get as far as having the uploader load a couple of blank boxes where the image should show up, but that is it. am I trying to do something that can't be done like loading a jquery script and then loading another?
[09:38:38] <clarkk> I don't understand the example in the docs for scrollTop() at http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/. Could someone tell me where my code is wrong, please? http://jsfiddle.net/opx8vv9d/4/
[09:43:36] <kpap> que se passe-t'il ici ?
[09:54:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is it safe in an ajax call to just do this: $password.val() = send to server and do password encryption server side?
[09:55:38] <Jattenalle> ecky--ptang-zoob, it'll be sent in plaintext
[09:55:46] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: That’s how it’s always done.
[09:55:58] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: This is why most login pages are HTTPS
[09:56:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can't it be intercepted?
[09:56:50] <Jattenalle> not with HTTPS, without, yes
[09:57:13] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Unlikely when using HTTPS… but guess there’s a possibility if the NSA has some magic.
[09:57:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> aight
[09:57:21] * systemfault puts his tin foil hat
[09:57:59] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: That’s how every website is doing it… sending the password in cleartext via HTTPS
[09:58:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oki
[09:58:28] <systemfault> (Every non stupid website… I’ve seen logins that weren’t HTTPS…)
[10:03:48] <harrisonn> I need help with a really basic jquery getJSON question
[10:04:09] <harrisonn> i have this function here that just grabs a json response but for some reason it's coming up null
[10:04:16] <harrisonn> this is the code: http://pastebin.com/k6KNPx82
[10:05:19] <harrisonn> basically, what I thought $.getJSON parameters do is pretty much append make it so we are going to "statistics_batchdb.jsp?batch_number=(batch_num)&slice_stats=true
[10:05:41] <harrisonn> minus "append", is this not coorrect?
[10:05:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What's wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/kgfGwgSV it says illegal invocation
[11:19:55] <MadTBone> I want to use .each() to run a named function on each element of a jQuery selection, but can't seem to get $(this) to work properly in my function.  I would expect line 11 in the following JS to make the text blue: http://jsfiddle.net/0mkbjd92/4/
[11:28:03] <jop008> Hi my input field must be 80% width but it is taken 100%
[12:01:20] <eager> MadTBone: apparently " this " is not what you meant where you used it. but if the elem we want to manipulate is also passed in, then it works: http://jsfiddle.net/0mkbjd92/5/
[12:14:16] <phoenixsun> is typeahead.js the offered autocomplete library over the jQuery widget?
[12:14:35] <phoenixsun> offered = preferred?
[12:38:23] <luigi69> Hi.
[12:38:30] <wa5ted> phoenixsun: imo its what ever gets the job done, sometimes i use non ame libraries
[12:38:35] <wa5ted> luigi69: hi
[12:39:49] <phoenixsun> wa5ted: I read little deeper and the Bloodhound feature of typeahead sounds interesting but I don't need it for now so I will go with the jQuery implementation first
[12:41:14] <luigi69> I have a question... I send ajax requests when an event occurs. Before response comes back, new requests might be sent. I woulde like to manage this, so that I do something when the last request response comes back. Is there something in jQuery that could help me with that?
[12:43:57] <wa5ted> luigi69: have you considered stackign the requests
[12:44:04] <wa5ted> so that first in first out
[12:44:08] <wa5ted> if thats what you want
[12:44:39] <MadTBone> eager: thanks.  that's a bit better than my solution.  I realized that the function called by .each() is actually a callback, so I came up with: http://jsfiddle.net/ufzL58pg/ ... your method actually allows feeding arguments to the function
[12:46:23] <luigi69> wa5ted: Not really I think.
[12:47:17] <luigi69> wa5ted: It's like... I get data from sever on form update event. I would like to ignore currently sent and running ajax requests, if a new change occurs.
[12:47:40] <wa5ted> hmmmm
[12:47:45] <luigi69> So that I would do something only when the last request response comes back.
[12:47:55] <wa5ted> so what you are talkig about
[12:47:59] <wa5ted> is say you are sending a request
[12:48:08] <wa5ted> and at the same time i have submited content
[12:48:12] <wa5ted> yu want my stuff pulled
[12:48:16] <luigi69> yep
[12:48:24] <luigi69> and ignore the request before
[12:48:25] <wa5ted> i suggest you query the db
[12:48:42] <wa5ted> and then chck for new stuf before processing the content that you uplaoded
[12:48:46] <wa5ted> and if so
[12:48:48] <eager> MadTBone: that's interesting, because you pass in " index " and " item " args, that seemingly you don't use, still, wait, it seems to be working without them too... http://jsfiddle.net/ufzL58pg/1/
[12:49:02] <wa5ted> grab that new cotnent i uploaded and send a message to the screen letting the user know so
[12:49:20] <luigi69> no no, there's no db involved
[12:49:30] <luigi69> i generate an image based on form input
[12:49:34] <wa5ted> okay
[12:49:43] <wa5ted> well the only thing yo ucan do
[12:49:47] <wa5ted> is produce a button
[12:49:56] <wa5ted> that says new content please refresh
[12:50:01] <eager> actually, I'm quite rookie when have to use function arguments in js. a world full of magic and surprises and ... surprises :)
[12:50:03] <wa5ted> or something like that
[12:50:08] <wa5ted> otherwise users will be like wtf
[12:50:25] <luigi69> I was thinking like... I could store last request identifier
[12:50:38] <luigi69> and on each response callback check is it this one.
[12:51:14] <luigi69> if in the meantime a new request would be sent - the identifier would be overwritten, so...
[12:51:27] <luigi69> but I wonder is there a method that would help me with that
[12:51:29] <luigi69> in jQuery
[12:51:58] <luigi69> you know what I mean, wa5ted?
[12:52:49] <wa5ted> yeah that would not be a bad idea
[12:53:02] <wa5ted> try writing your own
[12:53:14] <wa5ted> cause what you are talking about has a whole lot to do with live sockets
[12:53:17] <wa5ted> i think
[12:53:19] <wa5ted> anyways
[12:53:31] <wa5ted> try something along the lines of what you were saying
[12:55:50] <MadTBone> eager: according to the docs, .each() will always pass the index of the iteration and the current element to the callback function.  I just had them in the function signature so I could use them if I wanted to.  They're not needed in this case.  The callback is called within the context of the currently iterated element, so $(this) should work.
[12:56:32] <eager> I have to spend more __patient__ time going through those docs
[12:56:42] <MadTBone> same here
[12:57:19] <eager> :) thanks for pointing out though, you got me started to the right direction
[12:58:07] <MadTBone> but in this case, $(this) and $(item) are equivalent
[12:59:11] <MadTBone> thanks to you too!
[13:04:54] <crontab> hi
[13:05:26] <crontab> anyone here
[13:05:27] <crontab> ?
[13:07:38] <Jattenalle> egweimai, no
[13:07:49] <Jattenalle> egweimai, just ask your question, someone will answer it if they can :)
[13:07:57] <egweimai> okk :)
[13:08:00] <egweimai> that i will do
[13:08:08] <egweimai> i just looking for the class name of my site :) to ask the question
[13:08:49] <egweimai> i have a class name imageremove ...also i have another one
[13:09:01] <egweimai> ext_custom_html
[13:09:21] <egweimai> that i want to do is when the imageremove class exist to delete the div of ext_custom_html
[13:15:29] <Gareth__> Hi guys, I'm new to jQuery and IRC. I have a newbie question about the addClass attribute. When trying to addClass to the body tag in the css file, it doesn't work when I use the '.' class selector on the class that I am trying to add. For example, $('body').addClass('summereve'); works but not '$('body').addClass('.summereve');   Why doesn't jquery recognise that it's a class selector when being added to the body tag?
[13:21:57] <wa5ted> well its doing ..summereve
[13:22:01] <wa5ted> which doesnt make sense
[13:22:05] <wa5ted> it adds the dot for you
[13:22:08] <wa5ted> or so i suspect
[13:22:11] <wa5ted> Gareth__: ^
[13:23:37] <seggy> hello all, i have a question, should $.get('http://learn.knockoutjs.com/mail', { 'folder': "Inbox" }, self.chosenFolderData); get the data and assign it to self.chosenFolderData ?
[13:24:11] <seggy> i can curl the data and get it, but the $.get() fails, and does $.post()
[13:29:53] <Gareth__> Thanks for the reply! Turns out I was being a newbie, I thought I was only encountering this problem with the body tag!
[13:30:20] <seggy> hello, can someone help me?
[13:33:14] <frothnicator> I find myself studying some of the jQuery codebase, and realize I'm stuck at a very basic statement: can anyone enlighten me as to the point of this line near the very end of the jQuery.js file?  'if ( typeof window === "object" && typeof window.document === "object" ) {'
[13:33:48] <frothnicator> It's clearly checking that window is an object, as is the document property, but why?  Won't jQuery just not work if that's the case, as it won't work anyway?
[13:38:58] <Nyoom> g
[13:39:18] <Nyoom> What am I doing wrong here? https://lua-documentation-c9-jordynl.c9.io/ it just doesn't want to make a data Table of it :(
[13:45:58] <hxm> hello, i am using Morris.js and i try to make a stats graph, i use this http://jsfiddle.net/ycphazj6/ and the result is pretty useless, someone know how to fix this? i dont find any way to make the vertical indicator smaller
[13:51:02] <cortexman> i'm on a page with infinite scroll and jquery doesn't seem to have access to some of the elements that have been loaded
[13:52:42] <Keavon> How can I apply an event to multiple objects selected by a selector, like $("h1").mousedown?
[14:00:42] <Nyoom> Apparently no helpful person available :(
[15:33:18] <dublee> if i setup a eventhandler for a button to delete a table row, and within that row i have a delete button to delete that row why would the function only work with already existing table rows and not the ones added via js?
[15:34:32] <BillCriswell> dublee: That sounds confusing.
[15:35:19] <dublee> yeah i realized that after reading what i typed
[15:35:25] <dublee> let me codepen it
[15:35:30] <BillCriswell> dublee: Ok.
[15:35:40] <BillCriswell> If you're putting the event handler right on the button that would be an issue.
[15:35:56] <dublee> i place them at the bottom of the page
[15:36:22] <BillCriswell> I imagine you want something like $('table').on('click', 'button', function () { ... }); and no $('button').on('click', function () { ... });
[15:36:38] <dublee> possibly
[15:37:28] <clarkk> I don't understand the example in the docs for scrollTop() at http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/. Could someone tell me where my code is wrong, please? http://jsfiddle.net/opx8vv9d/4/
[15:38:49] <BillCriswell> clarkk: I think you actually want the offset. The scrollTop would be for how far down a particular element is scrolled itself.
[15:39:14] <BillCriswell> clarkk: http://jsfiddle.net/opx8vv9d/5/
[15:40:23] <clarkk> BillCriswell: thanks for answering :)  But what I want is for the value in output to update as the window is scrolling
[15:43:16] <BillCriswell> clarkk: http://jsfiddle.net/opx8vv9d/6/ this?
[15:43:46] <dublee> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ebEIi
[15:45:46] <clarkk> BillCriswell: yes, I think that's it. Thank you very much
[15:45:54] <BillCriswell> No problem clarkk.
[15:46:55] <clarkk> another question - if you select the same elements twice within the same function, will the objects be cached, or is it better to assign it to a variable and use the variable both times?
[15:47:18] <systemfault> clarkk: No caching.. so assign it
[15:47:26] <clarkk> ok, thank you  systemfault
[15:47:53] <BillCriswell> dublee: You want to look into event delegation.
[15:47:58] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/badurefe/1/edit is the basic idea.
[15:48:12] <BillCriswell> You put the listener on the table and see what element triggered it.
[15:49:17] <dublee> I see, thank you.
[15:49:30] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[15:50:55] <tocka> Hi guys
[15:51:23] <tocka> Just wanted to ask, would it be possible to check if div with a specific class exists after certain element?
[15:52:39] <BillCriswell> tocka: What do you mean by after?
[15:52:52] <BillCriswell> Are the elements siblings or just later down the DOM?
[15:53:20] <tocka> its being added later
[15:53:57] <BillCriswell> Where to though?
[15:54:31] <BillCriswell> Or do you want to do it just based on time?
[15:54:38] <tocka> no not really..
[15:54:58] <tocka> Im using jquery validate plugin, and I want to add a tick image after succesfull validation
[15:55:07] <tocka> but now its adding not one but a lot of images
[15:55:17] <tocka> thats my problem
[15:55:17] <tocka> :/
[15:56:49] <BillCriswell> I'm just having a hard time following. Have an example somewhere?
[15:59:13] <dublee> works well
[15:59:50] <k4r1m> is there a way to attach a handler for class/attribute changes?
[16:01:03] <k4r1m> ignore that...
[16:01:23] <tw2113> ignore what k4r1m ?
[16:01:40] <k4r1m> tw2113: my question.
[16:01:46] <tw2113> what question
[16:01:54] <tw2113> :)
[16:01:59] <k4r1m> tw2113: "4:59:50 PM <k4r1m> is there a way to attach a handler for class/attribute changes?"
[16:02:14] <RizziCR> :D
[16:02:23] <k4r1m> Yeah lol.
[16:02:27] <tw2113> all I see is "[18:02]  <k4r1m> tw2113: "
[16:02:30] <tw2113> did you forget something?
[16:02:51] <RizziCR> is it possible to submit an post request before the user leave a side?
[16:03:44] <RizziCR> i try with unbeforeunload.. but the post request not send
[16:03:57] <k4r1m> tw2113: really? http://imgur.com/oOZDOQe
[16:04:22] <tw2113> k4r1m, are you kind of short? because my sarcasm is going right over your head :P
[16:04:57] <tw2113> "[18:01]  <k4r1m> ignore that?" exactly what i have been doing :P
[16:05:17] <RizziCR> ^^
[16:06:12] <k4r1m> I've used irc for over ten years yet I'm still oblivious to people's sarcasm on here. Except on #haskel
[16:06:18] <tocka> i have this " <input class="valid" type="text" value="" maxlength="30" name="firstname"> " as a string, is it possible for me to get name attribute value from this?
[16:07:14] <RizziCR> tocka use regex
[16:07:20] <tocka> goood idea
[16:07:55] <BillCriswell> tw2113: lol
[16:08:26] <BillCriswell> tocka: No regex.
[16:08:31] <tocka> y not?
[16:08:47] <BillCriswell> $(string).attr('name')
[16:08:57] <RizziCR> it’s a string
[16:09:04] <BillCriswell> I'm aware.
[16:09:07] <tocka> Hmmm
[16:09:11] <tocka> Lets try it
[16:09:12] <RizziCR> ok.
[16:09:13] <RizziCR> :)
[16:09:17] <BillCriswell> That's why I chose the name string for the variable lol
[16:09:22] <RizziCR> BillCriswell: you are right
[16:10:06] <tocka> it works
[16:10:10] <tocka> you know your magic sir
[16:10:16] <tocka> (bow)
[16:10:18] <tocka> thanks:)
[16:12:22] <BillCriswell> tocka: No problem
[16:51:36] <kpap> yes
[17:21:52] <kpap> I think
[17:54:01] <Zak> if the window is already loaded, it appears as though $(window).load() doesn't fire. Is there a workaround for this?
[17:55:28] <shoky> use an event that you actually want to listen for instead..?
[17:56:57] <Zak>  hmm, there's too many caveats around load(). I won't use it
[17:57:14] <Zak> shoky: i'm trying to solve a problem where Chrome is restoring scroll position to an undesired position
[17:57:31] <Zak> window.load seemed late enough
[17:57:40] <shoky> what do you mean, restoring? like on a reload?
[17:57:43] <Zak> yeah
[17:57:49] <Zak> so i want to draw focus to a particular element
[17:57:54] <shoky> why does it matter what happens on a reload ?
[17:58:03] <Zak> and if i do it too early, Chrome will restore to another position
[17:58:06] <shoky> an app shouldn't depend on reloads..
[17:58:17] <Zak> what..?
[17:58:27] <Zak> it matters because i'm doing onboarding flow
[17:58:37] <shoky> no idea what that is
[17:58:39] <Zak> and i want to draw attention to a particular element
[17:58:49] <shoky> anyways i don't think there's a non hacky way of doing it
[17:58:51] <Zak> if they scroll away, they'll potentially get lost or side-tracked
[17:59:19] <Zak> ah man, how annoying
[17:59:22] <shoky> why would they reload though...
[17:59:33] <frank_o> Anyone know what's up with the delay between hover and SVG animation start? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xgjpL3bg/
[17:59:36] <frank_o> The SVG also flickers for like a millisecond before it disappears and reappears to complete the animation.
[17:59:43] <shoky> or are you triggering the reload yourself
[17:59:47] <Zak> shoky: its not a question of why.. it's more of a question of... what happens if they do?
[18:00:03] <shoky> if they do then a reload should happen, with everything that reloads entails..
[18:00:25] <Zak> ok, fair enough i guess
[18:00:33] <shoky> but if your app is built right, there's no reason for them to reload
[18:00:54] <Zak> they shouldn't be reloading
[18:00:58] <Zak> as in, it's not expected behaviour
[18:01:04] <Zak> it's just something i noticed
[18:01:15] <Zak> because i'm dev-ing it now, and i was like, "why isn't this element being focused?"
[18:01:22] <Zak> then i noticed that Chrome is restoring the scroll position
[18:01:22] <Zak> etc
[18:05:51] <shoky> Zak but then what did you mean with "if the window is already loaded" ?
[18:09:38] <Zak> $(window).load() only seems to "trigger" if you call it early enough
[18:09:49] <Zak> unlike $(document).ready()
[18:10:06] <Zak> so they behaviour differently
[18:10:09] <Zak> *behave
[18:10:45] <Zak> so programatically, it matters if you're trying to catch the change of state, or if you only care about the final state
[18:15:16] <shoky> welp yeah you gotta call it in a script that's executed before it's loaded already. like in the outermost scope of a <script> that's in the static html
[18:17:07] <shoky> e.g. this is working ok for me at the end of <body> tag:    <script> window.onload=function() { setTimeout(function() { window.scrollTo(0,0); }, 0) }; </script>
[18:26:20] <ccmonster> i just did yo-webapp, but i'm curious which less files I should be editing.
[18:26:46] <ccmonster> they are all under a bower > bootstrap > less > ..., yet there is a style > style.css under the app folder. I'm just confused what I should be doing, or editing as part of my workflow
[19:31:35] <wa5ted> ccmonster: question so oyu are using bootstrap with less correct?
[19:31:41] <ccmonster> yes
[19:31:45] <wa5ted> i would not recommend editing any of the base files
[19:31:55] <ccmonster> i just went and made a main.less under my style dir
[19:31:56] <wa5ted> create a seperate custom less file
[19:32:02] <wa5ted> custom.less
[19:32:04] <wa5ted> main.less
[19:32:07] <wa5ted> ad dit to the import
[19:32:09] <wa5ted> file
[19:32:11] <wa5ted> add it
[19:32:15] <wa5ted> app.less
[19:32:17] <wa5ted> or something
[19:32:24] <wa5ted> it imports a bunch of less files
[19:32:32] <wa5ted> and then add your main.less import there
[19:32:37] <wa5ted> and then right some override classes
[19:32:41] <wa5ted> ccmonster: ^
[19:33:53] <ccmonster> where is the app.less
[19:34:09] <ccmonster> and where is the 'import'
[19:43:59] <Zak> where is the love
[20:00:57] <wa5ted> ccmonster: youll have to look for it
[20:01:03] <wa5ted> if i thin less is setup the same way
[20:01:14] <wa5ted> ccmonster: there should be a file with a bunch of import statements
[20:01:18] <wa5ted> orsomething
[20:01:19] <ccmonster> i'm just trying to find the imports
[20:01:46] <ccmonster> found it. it's bootstrap.less
[20:01:55] <wa5ted> yup
[20:01:59] <wa5ted> so essentially
[20:02:02] <wa5ted> after all the importas
[20:02:09] <wa5ted> for bootstrapadd in your custom less file
[20:02:13] <ccmonster> import my main.less
[20:02:14] <wa5ted> in the same way i suppose
[20:02:17] <wa5ted> yes
[20:02:20] <wa5ted> after
[20:02:25] <wa5ted> all of the default bootstrap importats
[20:02:27] <wa5ted> imports
[20:03:10] <ccmonster> i put it at the bottom
[20:04:25] <ccmonster> the issue is, once i @font-family-artistic: "KomikaAxisRegular", Helvetica, sans-serif; something like that, how do I make a .header-artistic, use that less
[20:04:33] <axjax1> can you write javascript on one page to simulate a click on another page in an iframe
[20:05:52] <ccmonster> #about h3 {
[20:05:52] <ccmonster> font-family: @font-family-artistic;}
[20:05:59] <ccmonster> can i do that wa5ted
[20:06:04] <ccmonster> is that essentially what you mean?
[20:06:28] <wa5ted> well here is the thing
[20:06:30] <wa5ted> let me ask you this
[20:06:42] <wa5ted> ccmonster: its importing all those files
[20:06:45] <wa5ted> essentially
[20:06:51] <wa5ted> its compiling it into all these css files
[20:06:59] <wa5ted> all these less files into 1 css files
[20:07:07] <wa5ted> so to answer your question if
[20:07:11] <axjax1> i imagine it would be a security vulnerability
[20:07:24] <axjax1> can i write js on one page
[20:07:32] <axjax1> that simulates a click on another different page
[20:07:33] <axjax1> in an iframe
[20:08:05] <wa5ted> ccmonster: if you call the font files before you actually call them to use them in a class you should be fine
[20:08:34] <wa5ted> axjax1: from where is the page in the iframe being loaded?
[20:08:49] <wa5ted> in any case
[20:08:53] <axjax1> the iframe is being loaded on the same page with the js that would be simulating the click
[20:08:53] <wa5ted> wrap iframe in a div
[20:08:59] <wa5ted> and then target the div you wnt for  a click event
[20:09:21] <axjax1> are you sure this is possible?
[20:09:55] <axjax1> i can have a page with an iframe in it to another website and js code that can simulate clicks on that other website in the iframe
[20:10:20] <axjax1> iframe and js code on the same page
[20:10:25] <axjax1> website is totally differentr
[20:10:30] <axjax1> from that page
[20:10:38] <ccmonster> but if that's the case, that snippet is correct, wa5ted?
[20:12:40] <wa5ted_> axjax1: what do oyu mean simulate
[20:12:52] <axjax1> have it click on the other page
[20:12:54] <wa5ted_> ccmonster: i beleive its correct
[20:13:34] <wa5ted_> i think so
[20:13:35] <wa5ted_> i mean you could try in a fiddle
[20:13:38] <wa5ted_> and see how that goes
[20:13:41] <wa5ted_> cause remember an iframe is just an html doc loaded into a "window"
[20:18:48] <ccmonster> wa5ted: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/21711c80ea64cd61a2e6
[20:18:54] <ccmonster> doesn't seem to be picking up
[20:19:50] <wa5ted> ccmonster: check this out https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/less/variables.less
[20:20:07] <wa5ted> check your font names
[20:20:13] <ccmonster> what you mean?
[20:20:16] <ccmonster> what's wrong with them
[20:20:39] <ccmonster> i am able to declare new font-names and such, i'd assume
[20:21:02] <wa5ted> well no i was aying look at the variables.less
[20:21:06] <wa5ted> as an example
[20:21:12] <wa5ted> it seems you are doign stuff right
[20:21:27] <wa5ted> im just asking you to verify your files exist where you specified them
[20:21:59] <ccmonster> yea, because before i was just using css and it was correct.
[20:22:10] <ccmonster> it looks like i can just reference the names, because they auto load from a fonts folder
[20:22:52] <ccmonster> woops, icon-font-path
[20:23:00] <wa5ted> kk
[20:23:11] <wa5ted> so it seems they may be getting overrideen
[20:23:15] <wa5ted> thats possible by the default
[20:23:25] <wa5ted> font
[20:23:27] <wa5ted> fonts
[20:24:48] <ccmonster> maybe
[20:32:55] <ccmonster> apparently font mixins are not easy
[20:34:49] <wa5ted> ccmonster: no they are not
[20:35:00] <ccmonster> sucks
[20:38:14] <wa5ted> lol
[20:38:20] <wa5ted> ccmonster: if everything was easy
[20:38:26] <wa5ted> everyone would be designers and developers
[20:48:36] <sammych1> is jQM toolbar('hide') like...broken?
[21:17:13] <kpap> hey, could you please send me a password reset email?
[21:35:21] <sammych1> that 1px shift of toolbars in jQM is really annoying
[22:23:01] <wa5ted> kpap: wha?
[22:23:11] <wa5ted> sammych1: override it
