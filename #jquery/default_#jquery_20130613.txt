[00:08:10] <Whirl3d> aaas, what are you trying to accomplish?
[00:08:11] <mogaj> can the button text of <input type="file"> from choose file to browse?
[00:09:33] <aaas> Whirl3d im trying to change the animation based on whether the forward or backward button is pressed...any idea on how to determine that
[00:09:50] <aaas> i know back OR forward,, but i dont know eahc one specifically
[00:10:01] <unnu> mogaj, its a browser specific thing, but you can hack it up with a photo if you want
[00:10:13] <mogaj> ok
[00:11:02] <Whirl3d> aaas, you are referring to the back and forward browser buttons, correct? Not some custom set of back/fwd buttons?
[00:11:10] <aaas> Whirl3d yes
[00:12:02] <Whirl3d> I tend to use BBQ for that. Not sure if there is something better out there, but BBQ seems to work still.
[00:12:28] <aaas> Whirl3d well i've already done tons of work with history.js so changing solutions isn't really something i want to do right now
[00:15:04] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I don't really know history.js. When I started working with js, it was already deprecated for hashchange. Sorry I can't help.
[00:17:44] <aaas> np...it is a rather specific question...ill just wait for a response over at the github...there are tons of people over there and the dev is very active so hopefully ill get a bite
[00:22:19] <behr> Hello, im looking for some really basic help on how to get jquery working. I cant seem to get either javascript or jquery to work
[00:26:15] <fabioportieri> behr: check if js is enabled in your browser
[00:26:39] <behr> I have, and it is, I also cleared all my cache and things, same problems in IE8 and firefox 21
[00:26:50] <fabioportieri> paste your stuff
[00:26:56] <Nemurenai> I have a weird question...
[00:27:08] <fabioportieri> Nemurenai: shoot
[00:27:18] <Nemurenai> I need to migrate some handlers from the deprecated 'live' to 'on'...
[00:27:29] <behr> its on http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/ about halfways down there is a ":complete example"
[00:27:42] <Nemurenai> I was wondering if anyone here knew of the most concise way of doing that in vim
[00:27:48] <behr> im just saving that as index.html and trying to get something to work
[00:28:15] <fabioportieri> behr: check if jquery is really loaded, learn how to use browser developer tools
[00:28:17] <Nemurenai> i.e. if a regular expression, yanking to a named buffer or a certain key sequence or macro was the way to go
[00:28:44] <Nemurenai> I guess a macro is easiest
[00:29:04] <fabioportieri> Nemurenai: how much code are you talking about? isn't regex a little too much for the task??
[00:29:21] <Nemurenai> also, sorry that it's more vim than jQuery related, but I figured someone in here would be in the same situation
[00:29:46] <Nemurenai> fabioportieri, maybe a dozen handlers in a couple of projects
[00:29:48] <behr> fabio, im not really sure how to do that. I have the firefox develop bar but all i can find is css and html things, nothing about javascript
[00:30:04] <fabioportieri> there isn't a script panel, behr ?
[00:30:59] <fabioportieri> there are errors in console window?
[00:31:20] <fabioportieri> in the net panel can't you see your resources loaded? check if jquery.js is loaded
[00:31:33] <behr> ok i found a "view javascript" button, and it shows the correct function there
[00:32:38] <behr> reference error $ is not defined i see in error log
[00:32:51] <fabioportieri> behr: ok that means jquery isn't loaded, provide the correct path
[00:34:06] <behr> is the correct file the 9000 line js file from the site?
[00:34:47] <fabioportieri> well it would be weird if the official jquery site provide a fake version of jquery
[00:35:12] <behr> ok i think that fixed it
[00:35:35] <behr> must have messed up there, thanks a ton
[00:35:45] <behr> guess i never saved it in the right place
[00:35:52] <fabioportieri> you're welcome
[00:36:40] <behr> now i can work out my click counter thing
[00:37:43] <behr> im working on a simple fake vote system, where it shows a number + up arrow/down arrow that changes the number by 1
[00:39:38] <aladdinwang> can jquery post ajax form data whose enctype is multipart/form-data?
[00:41:56] <bso> hello
[00:43:51] <fabioportieri> aladdinwang: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5392344/sending-multipart-formdata-with-jquery-ajax
[00:54:59] <jop008> How do I get the value of a single-select field in a form?
[00:55:44] <jop008> THis doesn't work $('#dropDownId').val()
[00:58:31] <AdamPDotty> $('#dropDownId option:selected').val() ?
[00:59:05] <ravenzz> does jQuery have a method to queue ajax requests?
[00:59:30] <AdamPDotty> there ae things like when().done()
[00:59:41] <ravenzz> yeah I know
[01:00:07] <ravenzz> nvm I found a good answer by gnarf on SO
[01:00:07] <ravenzz> http://stackoverflow.com/a/3314877
[01:22:07] <gianiaz> hi, I want to use the jquery ui accordion widget, but I don't want that clickin on the header opens the panel. I've tried this way:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9041888/how-to-prevent-jquery-ui-accordion-from-opening, but it doesn't work form me.  http://jsbin.com/ijajom/6/
[01:25:01] <lemonsparrow> I have a big div container... which has a lot of child divs.. now that is hardcoded in html but I want to build this part of DOM using jquery... how can I do it? using $.append... ?? isnt it easy ?
[01:25:14] <lemonsparrow> do I have to append each and every single element ?
[01:25:36] <systemfault> lemonsparrow: Never do that.
[01:26:11] <lemonsparrow> systemfault: then what is the better way ?
[01:26:35] <systemfault> Well.. it's usually to build a string and append it at the end
[01:29:36] <gianiaz> lemonsparrow I suggest you to take a look at handlebars. :-)
[01:30:00] <lemonsparrow> gianiaz: is there any jquery bot here ? for api links
[01:30:19] <gianiaz> for sure, but I don't know the syntax
[01:30:28] <gianiaz> I'm here rarely
[01:31:05] <gianiaz> lemonsparrow, anyway handlebar.js is a javascript template engine, it's not part of jquery
[01:32:01] <gianiaz> The right method is the one suggested by systemfault, but handlebar.js can help you write the html in a more readable way, then you can compose your string, but your code will be more readable
[01:33:40] <lemonsparrow> gianiaz: till now we have been using $.append
[01:33:59] <gianiaz> lemonsparrow, it's not wrong, but it's slower
[01:34:24] <gianiaz> and if you have a lot of elements you can notice the difference between the two methods
[01:34:36] <lemonsparrow> gianiaz: is handlebar.js a library ? or a jquery api ?
[01:34:46] <systemfault> lemonsparrow: So problem, but you definitely don't want to call append for every element, just call it once.
[01:34:47] <gianiaz> it's a separate library
[01:41:13] <gianiaz> lemonsparrow, http://jsbin.com/ulanup/1/edit
[01:46:14] <bso> hello, I have a problem with this code,
[01:46:14] <bso> somebody can help me ?

[01:47:10] <bso> http://jsbin.com/ukoheg/1/edit
[01:48:44] <MACscr> ok, you might have to resize Result Window to something smaller than 970px wide, but then open up your inspector tool and what what happens to the html when you click on "Im New" http://jsfiddle.net/zv6rt/
[01:49:11] <MACscr> for some reason the style attribute keeps changing. It should only adjust once and im not sure why its cycling
[02:01:00] <bso> thx yano
[02:10:17] <Coltaine> can somebody help me to add hoverintent to the jquery ui tooltip?
[02:13:00] <Coltaine> here is my code: http://pastebin.com/2DydcXcC
[02:17:59] <Coltaine> i get these errors: TypeError: i.out is undefined and TypeError: i.over.apply is not a function
[02:22:06] <remybach> If you're going to pass it an object, you need to specify the 'over' and 'out' functionsâ€¦ see the bottom example in the documentation here: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[02:35:29] <diphtherial> hey, i'm using this library to draw a graph on a webpage: https://github.com/dhotson/springy
[02:35:33] <Coltaine> ok i did that but it's no working as intended, a better solution would be to delay the content callback. But I don't know how to do this
[02:35:53] <diphtherial> i can attach it fine, but i'd like to be able to remove and recreate the graph from scratch; it seems like each time i initialize the graph, the old versions are still attached to the canvas, too
[02:36:33] <diphtherial> i haven't been able to find anything in the docs or source for the project about removing the jquery...er, thing...that's been initialized on the canvas object
[02:37:16] <diphtherial> is there a standard approach for that? e.g. if i call $("#some_div").myPluginInit(); on something, is there a way to remove it from some_div in a standard way? maybe i have to destroy and recreate some_div?
[02:39:28] <diphtherial> well, for future reference, removing and recreating some_div seems to work
[02:39:43] <diphtherial> hard to tell what extra variables are floating around unclaimed by the gc, though...
[02:42:52] <lejocelyn> I don't understand why the success part of this $.ajax isn't executed
[02:42:53] <lejocelyn> http://pastebin.fr/27720
[02:43:01] <lejocelyn> nor the error
[02:43:29] <lejocelyn> the breakpoints of Firebug just go over success and then skip it
[02:44:22] <lejocelyn> json answer can look like : {"email":"re@test.com"} or null or {} or whatever
[02:44:27] <lejocelyn> it doesn't change anythin
[02:44:28] <lejocelyn> g
[02:44:53] <lejocelyn> I'm just stuck not understand what's wrong with it
[02:44:54] <lejocelyn> :(
[02:46:55] <lejocelyn> I've read quit a lot of threads on stackexchange about $.ajax() not processing the success event
[02:47:05] <lejocelyn> none where relevant to my issue
[02:51:30] <shoky> lejocelyn: what's the status of the request in devtools network tab?
[02:52:14] <shoky> lejocelyn: why do you have both 'success' and .done()  ?
[02:52:41] <shoky> lejocelyn: and all your variables are global..
[02:52:47] <lejocelyn> shoky: status is ok
[02:53:48] <lejocelyn> shoky: I thought .done() was executed after
[02:53:59] <shoky> lejocelyn: if you put a console.log as first line in the success and error  callbacks, you don't see them?
[02:54:27] <sangeeta_> hello
[02:54:35] <shoky> lejocelyn:  it is probably executed after.. but then why do you need a seperate callback for that code, just put that code at the end of the 'success' callback
[02:54:49] <shoky> lejocelyn: or alternatively put the success code at the beginnign of the done callback.
[02:55:17] <lejocelyn> shoky: no, I don't see anything if I put console.log something after success or error callbacks
[02:55:57] <xdjuj> Hi
[02:56:04] <xdjuj> I've a little problem with live
[02:57:30] <shoky> lejocelyn: after?  i meant put it inside, as first line in the callback
[02:59:09] <lejocelyn> shoky: sorry, this code is a bit strange but I was trying many things to see what could be the issue
[02:59:15] <shoky> lejocelyn: and you see the expected json response in the network tab? pastebin/screenshot that
[02:59:27] <lejocelyn> yes, two secs
[02:59:47] <shoky> xdjuj: live is deprecated/removed. what's the problem
[03:00:40] <shoky> lejocelyn: and your original page is run from a webserver, yea? not from the local filesystem
[03:02:24] <lejocelyn> shoky: yes, from Linux apache
[03:04:58] <lejocelyn> shoky: I'm uploading the image, sorry slow connection
[03:05:51] <shoky> lejocelyn: btw you have an extra comma in line 9
[03:05:57] <lejocelyn> now I just changed some bits according to your advices (local variables) and I have a new error : TypeError: checkEmailInDB(...) is undefined after the function is executed
[03:06:51] <shoky> donno what you did there..
[03:06:57] <shoky> nor how you're calling that function
[03:07:25] <lejocelyn> http://imgur.com/iSXYybJ
[03:07:41] <lejocelyn> shoky: I'm updating the pastebin code
[03:11:08] <lejocelyn> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/qWbkr/
[03:13:57] <shoky> lejocelyn:  you need to return $.ajax(..);   if you want to call done on the return value
[03:14:10] <shoky> lejocelyn: you're curretly not returning anything from checkEmailInDB
[03:16:41] <lejocely1> shoky: sorry a little bug
[03:16:54] <lejocely1> shoky: I though I shouldn't return anything from an ajax function
[03:17:11] <lejocely1> as it wasn't synchrous
[03:17:17] <shoky> lejocely1: i didnt say to return from inside the ajax function
[03:17:37] <lejocely1> then how?
[03:17:41] <shoky> lejocely1: i said to return the jqXHR object itself.  return $.ajax(....);
[03:18:07] <shoky> lejocely1: but i'd go for something more like this, piping with .then():   http://jsfiddle.net/qWbkr/2/
[03:18:25] <shoky> lejocely1: this way you don't need that global "valid_email"
[03:19:30] <shoky> lejocely1:  by doing  "return valid_email"  from the .then() callback,  it will "pipe" that valid_email to be the new "data" for the .done() that's called on it later
[03:19:41] <shoky> much nicer
[03:21:00] <shoky> lejocely1: uhh a problem tho is that you're referencing "emailField" inside the done callback
[03:22:19] <lejocely1> uhh, I correct that
[03:22:28] <lejocely1> thanks
[03:22:47] <shoky> lejocely1: oh and i didnt notice you're using valid_email also in checkRequiredInput
[03:23:22] <lejocely1> that's why it should be global
[03:23:58] <shoky> nah
[03:24:10] <shoky> lejocely1  http://jsfiddle.net/qWbkr/3/   the fiddle even works now
[03:27:05] <lejocely1> shoky: what I wanted to do actually for checkRequiredInputs(){} was to have a unlimited number of arguments
[03:27:13] <lejocely1> but I couldn't yet findout how to do that
[03:28:22] <lejocely1> if you know python, something like : def myfunction(*args) :
[03:29:19] <shoky> best is to just send an object
[03:29:42] <shoky> function myfunc(options) {  if (options.valid_email) { .... } )
[03:30:13] <MACscr> im wondering if i can use jquery to do this, but how can i style just "Level3A"? http://jsfiddle.net/yMyfc/
[03:30:39] <lejocely1> ok, thanks
[03:30:56] <lejocely1> problem solved :)
[03:34:09] <shoky> MACscr: can't edit the html?
[03:34:45] <MACscr> shoky: well i have classes on on my real one, but its not level based
[03:35:05] <KebabBob> How do I get the selected option of a <select> tag with jquery?
[03:36:47] <shoky> MACscr: welp.. http://jsfiddle.net/yMyfc/1/
[03:36:57] <shoky> KebabBob:  .val()
[03:37:27] <_rgn> KebabBob: did you bother googling "jquery selected"
[03:37:29] <shoky> KebabBob:  that gets the selected option's value.  if you want the option itself.. $('select option:selected')
[03:37:55] <KebabBob> Yeah I did google, but didn't find a solution that worked
[03:38:29] <KebabBob> Was trying something like $('#select option[selected="selected"]') but that didn't work
[03:39:00] <_rgn> interesting you would try that since :selected is the first hit on google
[03:39:24] <azazel91> does anybody know how to have a drop down with 4 values
[03:39:52] <azazel91> the autocomplete i mean
[03:39:58] <shoky> azazel91: what do you mean
[03:41:13] <azazel91> the autocomplete i want it to be like myspaces like 4 printed keywords
[03:41:53] <shoky> don't know what myspaces is. you'll have to be more specific... "4 printed keywords" doesn't help much
[03:42:08] <Nemurenai> I wonder how I should fix this...I have two different types of tables with editable fields that I can activate with buttons that makes it possible to change individual lines as entries...
[03:42:34] <azazel91> check out myspace.com and see the function im not that good with discribing stuff
[03:42:40] <Nemurenai> I'm using a .on handler for the buttons....now, the problem is that I have one type of table inside another
[03:42:50] <Nemurenai> so the event bubbles to both tables
[03:43:15] <shoky> azazel91:  i'm on myspace.com  uhh what function...?
[03:43:32] <azazel91> the autocomplete
[03:43:37] <shoky> azazel91: you'll have to put some effort and explain stuff if you want people to put effort for helping
[03:43:38] <Nemurenai> i.e. I have table.settings > table.crud-table  and the handlers like: .on('.settings .edit' ...)
[03:43:55] <shoky> azazel91: WHAT autocomplete.
[03:44:00] <Nemurenai> How do I tie it to just the innermost one? Prevent event propagation maybe?
[03:44:36] <MACscr> shoky: here is closer to what i am trying to actually to do. This is a snippet of my actual code: http://jsfiddle.net/zv6rt/1/. Seems actually now that i have made some css adjustments, the sub menu's are opening correctly the first time, but they dont seem to work when you try to go back to them. Only the top 4 or so have sub menus
[03:45:48] <shoky> MACscr: no thanks ;]
[03:46:15] <MACscr> shoky: how about for a little money? =P
[03:47:42] <shoky> heh not right now anyways, that's just too much crap there and i should sleep ;P
[03:47:55] <MACscr> i know, it haunts me
[03:50:00] <shoky> MACscr: hit me up next time you see me if you'll still need help
[04:12:35] <dean[h]> Is it possible to use the closest selector to find the closest hidden parent?
[04:12:50] <dean[h]> e.g. obj.closest("*:hidden") or something along those lines?
[04:16:18] <remybach> Looks like it should work to meâ€¦ you shouldn't need the * though.
[04:16:25] <dean[h]> In fact, that won't do, as all child elements are hidden too
[04:16:34] <dean[h]> I need to find the actual parent element that is hiding all the children
[04:17:23] <remybach> Haâ€¦ of course.
[04:17:54] <dean[h]> Any ideas?
[04:22:25] <marl_scot> hi folks, i am trying to use the datepicker function, the picker is working ok apart from the fact that i cant set the date format, it always displays as mm-dd-yy, and i am trying to get it to display as dd-mm-yy my source code is here : http://pastebin.com/6tnGze1K  could some kind person tell me what i am missing? there are no errors on page load, so all scripts/css are loading ok, thanks
[04:31:25] <remybach> dean[h]: how is the parent hidden? I presume it's not via a class that you can target?
[04:33:29] <remybach> Otherwise you might try doing `.parents(':hidden')` and then get the last one out of that list?
[04:34:50] <remybach> So:
[04:34:50] <remybach> hiding = $(this).parents(':hidden');
[04:34:50] <remybach> hiddenParent = hiding[hiding.length];
[04:35:01] <remybach> Not 100% sure that'll work, but give it a whirl.
[04:56:14] <GreatPotato> Not jquery as such, but can anybody tell me what im getting an error with this:
[04:56:22] <GreatPotato> update: { options.container : options.partial }
[04:56:34] <GreatPotato> "missing : after property id"
[05:01:46] <Coltaine> I try to delete something from a database using ajax. If i push a button the record should be deleted but it is not working, only when I debug the function step by step it works. http://jsfiddle.net/PXUTJ/
[05:03:50] <platinoid> Hey, I am using this script http://pastebin.com/nNCNyqEP to output into div(.result) this file(test.php) http://pastebin.com/r52Q4A2n. My question is how can I use the variable $choice in the actual php file where the jquery is being called from?
[05:06:21] <Saaether> platinoid thats a php questions not a jquery one
[05:06:50] <Saaether> but if you were looking to just output it to the screen you would just <?php echo $choice; ?>
[05:07:14] <shoky> GreatPotato:  update: { 'options.container': options.partial }
[05:07:27] <shoky> GreatPotato: unless you wanted to actually put the value of options.container there ?
[05:07:28] <GreatPotato> But that will make it a string no?
[05:07:32] <GreatPotato> Yeh
[05:07:55] <shoky> GreatPotato:  var obj = { update: {} };  obj.update[options.container] = options.partial;
[05:08:20] <GreatPotato> Can;t do it with the alternative syntax no?
[05:08:25] <shoky> nope
[05:08:44] <platinoid> Saaether: No bro, If I am passing a variable through jquery then it is a jquery question.
[05:08:44] <GreatPotato> Thought as much, thats a shame, that syntax is much clearner
[05:09:01] <shoky> that syntax is for object _literals_
[05:09:03] <GreatPotato> Cheers shoky
[05:09:07] <shoky> options.container isn't literal
[05:09:16] <Saaether> platinoid you are asking how to use a php variable in a php file, how is that jquery related?
[05:11:36] <lejocely1> is there something like phpdocumentor for jquery or javascript ?
[05:12:10] <platinoid> Saaether: I tried using global from the php file that's loaded into a div in the current one. Cannot access it. If you know the answer then please.
[05:13:07] <platinoid> and I don't have to echo it
[05:13:24] <platinoid> I am calling the variable from elsewhere in the file
[05:13:34] <lejocely1> platinoid: are you trying to use a global variable from a php script into a javascript ?
[05:14:27] <Coltaine> anybody got an idea what I did wrong?
[05:18:02] <platinoid> lejocelyl: umm, the php script is echoed into a div in the callee file through jquery, I tried referencing it normally then by global, did not work
[05:18:13] <platinoid> skewed up logic?
[05:19:10] <Swapnesh> hi all, facing some problem with a jquery slider..I erally dont know what and where exactly do i ned to fix
[05:19:46] <Swapnesh> let me know if anyone can help here
[05:21:19] <Swapnesh> anyone ??
[05:21:33] <Saaether> Swapnesh, just ask your question and if any one can help you they will answer
[05:22:26] <Swapnesh> http://sbp.siteprogress.info/ <- This is my site ..but I am facing some trouble with the image slider on the top
[05:22:46] <Coltaine> ok i fixed my error
[05:23:04] <Swapnesh> on page load all images comes at once..this looks really bad..however it adjusts when page loads completely
[05:27:06] <Saaether> Swapnesh i dont see that issue when i load your webpage in any browser, but if its an issue you could try hiding your .featured div until it is loaded
[05:27:24] <lejocely1> what would be amazing with jsfiddle would be dynamical breakpoints
[05:28:12] <Swapnesh> Saaether how could i do this??
[05:29:55] <drager> So I have made a preview function for my site; http://jsfiddle.net/zF2zz/ it works as expected but when the second "tab" is active I want to change the text "Write comment" to "Continue writing" or something like that. Ideas?
[05:30:29] <Elrinth2> anyone here good with History.js ?
[05:30:45] <Saaether> Swapnesh add display:none; to your #featured div, and then in your js after you make the call to $("#featured").tabs show it again
[05:31:10] <Elrinth2> I'm having trouble... the following isn't executed on google chrome if i push the same state again History.Adapter.bind(window,'statechange',function(){});
[05:32:27] <Saaether> Swapnesh hmm actually they may not work, not sure if they elements need to be visible for .tabs to work, that could cause it to fail heh
[05:41:26] <MACscr> why isnt my preventdefault working here? http://jsfiddle.net/tfT7c/
[05:43:44] <MACscr> i added some comments to the code http://jsfiddle.net/tfT7c/1/
[05:44:41] <Saaether> MACscr dont forgot to include jquery in your examples =P
[05:44:52] <Saaether> and it appears to be working fine in chrome
[05:45:09] <drager> Works fine for me as well
[05:45:56] <Saaether> and fine in IE as well
[05:47:47] <lejocely1> shoky: if I understood properly .then(), it's for the .done methods to pass data to its arguments, no ?
[05:49:17] <soc42> hi #jquery
[05:49:21] <soc42> how can i do a form reset / reset all form values in background without a alert/dialog box occuring?
[05:50:10] <soc42> atm i am using .trigger("reset") which always triggers an alert box too
[05:51:52] <shoky> lejocely1:  that's one of its uses, yeah.. to change the arguments sent to the next .done callbacks
[05:52:42] <MACscr> Saaether: oops. here it is updated http://jsfiddle.net/tfT7c/2/
[05:53:03] <Saaether> MACscr and its still working =)
[05:53:05] <MACscr> still doesnt follow links on level 3 like it should and the other menus arent closing
[05:53:18] <Saaether> ahh
[05:53:36] <drager> So I have made a preview function for my site; http://jsfiddle.net/zF2zz/ it works as expected but when the second "tab" is active I want to change the text "Write comment" to "Continue writing" or something like that. Ideas?
[05:53:50] <MACscr> level 3b and level 3a should both go to google because it doesnt have sub menus
[05:54:04] <MACscr> and when level 2b is clicked, level 2a should have closed
[05:54:52] <RohanBhangui> drager: use .html() functin to replace text
[05:57:37] <RohanBhangui> drager: et me know if it works
[06:00:02] <RohanBhangui> soc42: in case you dont have answer it is different for each form element....for example: for textfields and textareas you can use $(textarea).val('');
[06:00:26] <RohanBhangui> for option elements you need a differnt method
[06:02:09] <lejocely1> is it a problem to pass a global variable as an argument of a function? or is it just not required ?
[06:02:31] <Elrinth2> can I do History.back(); History.forward(); and it only loads the forward one?
[06:02:37] <soc42> RohanBhangui: well thanks, that's exactly what i am trying to accomplish now... to do the steps one after another as i didn't find any way to prevent that alert box, while i need a functional rest in background and not a user interaction
[06:02:42] <Elrinth2> I tried History.go(0); but that won't work
[06:03:23] <RohanBhangui> ummm you could do event.preventDefault(); before reseting
[06:03:36] <RohanBhangui> are you refreshing the page before reseting the values soc42:
[06:04:07] <soc42> RohanBhangui: nope
[06:04:12] <MACscr> Saaether: no ideas now that you understand the issue? =P
[06:04:40] <Elrinth2> actually popState -> pushState fixed it for me
[06:05:03] <RohanBhangui> hmm
[06:05:14] <RohanBhangui> then ajax refresh would be best idea and then reset values
[06:05:35] <RohanBhangui> i dont realy ahve a context so i can only guess soc42:
[06:11:31] <charnel> Why is the first part is returning false and the second is undefined ? http://jsfiddle.net/jfxcN/
[06:13:43] <shoky> charnel:  the second 'return false' is inside another function in the $.each(function() { ... })
[06:14:23] <shoky> charnel: also use .prop('checked') or .is(':checked'),  not .attr('checked')
[06:14:46] <charnel> shoky, Thanks.
[06:15:07] <amcsi_work> http://jsfiddle.net/aBSHE/1/
[06:15:12] <amcsi_work> here's a fix, charnel
[06:16:23] <amcsi_work>     var ret = true;           ret = false;     return ret;
[06:16:26] <amcsi_work> are the 3 new rows
[06:17:00] <charnel> amcsi_work, Thank you very much
[06:19:23] <drager> RohanBhangui: You mean use .html() to first place the text, then change it?
[06:19:35] <RohanBhangui> yes
[06:19:45] <RohanBhangui> drager: alternatively you can preset the text like you did
[06:20:01] <RohanBhangui> and then just use .html to replace
[06:20:17] <drager> Hm alright
[06:22:11] <RohanBhangui> what are you thinking?
[06:24:31] <RohanBhangui> dager: make sure .html() is grabbing what you want and that the text that you replace is the same formatt as what you grab
[06:31:25] <RohanBhangui> drager: did it work?
[06:45:07] <Ilian> Hi
[06:45:37] <NaOH> I'm using jQuery mobile with a fixed header and fixed footer and the auto-calculated page padding for the bottom is correct, but the top padding is wrong. as soon as i resize the window a tiny bit, it is recalculated and works fine. how can i fix this?
[06:45:54] <Ilian> I have a problem when doing drag-and-drop between firefox windows, the drop event does not fire
[06:46:39] <Ilian> I used $('*').on('drop', function(e){alert('aaaa')}) and the alert is not shown, however it is working when drag-and-drop from a local folder
[06:46:42] <Ilian> any ideas?
[06:47:15] <Leukocyt_> Ilian: alert('aaaa'); ?
[06:47:20] <Leukocyt_> forgot the semicolumn?
[06:47:41] <Leukocyt_> Ilian: What are you dropping?
[06:47:45] <Ilian> image
[06:47:58] <Ilian> it works with a local file, and there are not JS errors
[06:48:04] <Leukocyt_> Ilian: What kind of element? An input file?
[06:48:12] <Ilian> but when I do it with and image it just opens the image url
[06:48:12] <Leukocyt_> <input type="file"
[06:48:50] <Leukocyt_> Ilian: That's because your browser thinks you want to open the image in the browser, it does not even reach the javascript part
[06:48:58] <Ilian> the code above should catch the event no matter where I dropped it
[06:49:03] <maxmoore14> need some help with the jqXHR object...
[06:49:07] <Ilian> well it work on google images
[06:49:21] <Leukocyt_> Ilian: What are you trying to accomplish ?
[06:49:23] <Ilian> with the same browser, probably there is something I am missing
[06:49:31] <maxmoore14> trying to set a progress handler for the upload object, but upload doesn't seem to exist
[06:49:31] <Ilian> drag-and-drop upload
[06:50:17] <maxmoore14> I can set progress for the jqXHR in general, but I don't think that is going to track upload progress, is it?
[06:51:21] <maxmoore14> beforeSend: function (jqXHR) { jqXHR.upload.addEventListener('progress', function (event) {}, false); }
[06:52:04] <Leukocyt_> Ilian: You have a snippet for me? : )
[06:52:26] <maxmoore14> but upload does not exist - also, can I use jquery .on() instead of addEventListener in this case?
[07:00:18] <lord4163> Hello
[07:02:21] <Ilian> Leukocyt_, I am trying with a siple exmaple but it is not working at all http://jsfiddle.net/dFceb/
[07:03:08] <Leukocyt_> Ilian: What browser are you working with?
[07:03:50] <Ilian> firefox 20.0 on Ubuntu
[07:04:27] <qdk> hi there... How do i get trigger to wait the actual delay in the following ->    $("#myId").delay(1000).trigger('click');
[07:05:29] <Leukocyt_> Ilian: You can only drop files in an <input type=file>, as far is i know.
[07:05:46] <Leukocyt_> Ilian: I do it like this: http://jsfiddle.net/dFceb/ and i make the input opacity 0 and put a wrap around it.
[07:07:10] <Ilian> Leukocyt_, thanks for the help but the link content is not changed
[07:07:16] <Leukocyt_> oh lol
[07:07:18] <Ilian> maybe I have overwritten your changes
[07:07:28] <Leukocyt_> http://jsfiddle.net/dFceb/3/
[07:07:33] <Leukocyt_> Forgot to press save (A)
[07:07:46] <lord4163> I'm having a few tabs and how should I make the navigation for it? Got 3 links #clients, #users, #library and to div's for them on display:none how should I do?
[07:08:04] <Leukocyt_> lord4163: http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[07:08:06] <Ilian> awesome
[07:08:10] <Ilian> thank you Leukocyt_
[07:08:14] <Leukocyt_> Ilian: You're welcome : )
[07:09:03] <lord4163> Leukocyt_: Hmm so easy :P
[07:14:55] <SuperTyp> hi everybody has someone used the jQuery-File-Upload-Plugin with his Wordpress page?
[07:16:12] <SuperTyp> this one
[07:16:12] <SuperTyp> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/
[07:17:57] <jedimind> im sure someone has
[07:17:59] <jedimind> whats the problem ?
[07:20:46] <SuperTyp> the problem is
[07:21:12] <SuperTyp> I have pasted the source code to the php page
[07:21:27] <SuperTyp> the demo source code
[07:22:08] <SuperTyp> but in the action of the form is "//jquery-file-upload.appspot.com/"
[07:22:28] <SuperTyp> what should it be replaced with?
[07:22:41] <SuperTyp> is it the index file?
[07:31:34] <c4ptnh00k> http://pastebin.com/DpQTg1Xd I keep getting the error of "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaults' of undefined bootstrap-image-gallery.js:36" can anyone help me with this
[07:37:42] <c4ptnh00k> http://pastebin.com/DpQTg1Xd I keep getting the error of "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaults' of undefined bootstrap-image-gallery.js:36" can anyone help me with this
[07:38:59] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Are you calling a plugin or something?
[07:39:17] <c4ptnh00k> blueimp
[07:40:58] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: you're including the blueimp plugin before including bootstrap
[07:41:12] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: A lot of code to sort through, but do you have the bootstrap modal Js in there?
[07:42:26] <c4ptnh00k> shoky just swapped them and same error
[07:42:30] <chokeamancer> c4ptnh00k: basically check for dependancies in JS.  for instance: include files not ordered correctly or included twice
[07:42:46] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Does that .min.js have the modal plugin?
[07:42:59] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: I will have to check
[07:43:07] <BillCriswell> Try $.fn.modal in the console and see what it returns.
[07:43:31] <c4ptnh00k> function (c){return this.each(function(){var d=a(this),e=d.data("modal"),f=typeof c=="object"&&c;e||d.data("modal",e=new b(this,f)),typeof c=="string"?e[c]():e.show()})}
[07:43:50] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: repaste.
[07:44:51] <c4ptnh00k> shoky:http://pastebin.com/G8Uw9Wsh
[07:45:04] <shoky> eh.
[07:45:23] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: dude, some minimum effort, PLEASE
[07:45:49] <BillCriswell> You still have bootstrap-image-gallery.js before bootstrap.min.js
[07:48:43] <c4ptnh00k> crap I thought i switched that. OK Shoky sorry I am trying here just getting frustrated. I know this is something simple. After switching bootstrap.min.js and bootstrap-image-gallery.js That error went away, but now I get that webkit is undefined. Here is a paste of just the dependancies http://pastebin.com/NcuUigen
[07:49:02] <shoky> you're getting webkit is undefined ?
[07:49:07] <c4ptnh00k> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'webkit' of undefined
[07:49:12] <malorie> I'm looking for a jquery plugin that auto-scrolls my site and stops doing so when e.g. the mouse wheel is used. any idea what I may can use?
[07:49:14] <shoky> that's not webkit is undefined
[07:49:15] <c4ptnh00k> sorry said it wrong
[07:49:47] <shoky> c4ptnh00k:  that plugin doesn't support jquery 1.9+
[07:50:38] <BillCriswell> Brutal.
[07:50:39] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: er actually its not from that plugin maybe
[07:51:16] <shoky> but only you'd know that
[07:51:47] <BillCriswell> malorie: Like.. any random speed?
[07:52:26] <c4ptnh00k> the error is comming from bootstrap.min.js ...
[07:52:36] <malorie> BillCriswell: like you provide an id and a duration, and it scrolls to that element in the given time
[07:52:38] <BillCriswell> It's coming from inside the house!
[07:52:45] <shoky> c4ptnh00k: then you're prolly using a bootstrap version that doesn't support jquery 1.9+
[07:52:48] <malorie> but scrolling is aborted as soon as you're scrolling manually
[07:52:53] <BillCriswell> malorie: Ahhh, you don't really need a plugin for that.
[07:53:11] <c4ptnh00k> hmm lemme check into that. Thanks!
[07:53:37] <BillCriswell> malorie: Let me see if I could come up with a nice demo for you.
[07:59:01] <ph0n3tic> Hey guys, I have a strange issue. I have an element, which is getting a class removed and added. Then I search the parent element for all instances of the old removed class. I expect 0 instances, but it returns the element with the new class, thinking it still only has the old class. This is with the find() method. Any ideas?
[07:59:49] <shoky> `demo @ ph0n3tic
[07:59:49] <b-ot> ph0n3tic: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:00:15] <ph0n3tic> shoky: this is within a pretty large app, I don't think i could really recreate it...
[08:00:31] <ph0n3tic> I was hoping someone would know if their is a 'live' version of find
[08:00:39] <ph0n3tic> or ran across a similar issue
[08:00:42] <shoky> ph0n3tic: find is 'live'
[08:01:20] <shoky> ph0n3tic: no ideas then. make a jsfiddle reproducing the issue, youll most likely solve the issue while attempting to do so
[08:02:54] <shoky> `cik
[08:03:01] <shoky> ;S
[08:03:31] <shoky> ph0n3tic: you can also give more details if you want..
[08:04:14] <ph0n3tic> So basically, I'm removing the class 'read' adding the class 'unread'. Then I use find to search for all elements of the class 'read'. It returns the element where I just removed that class.
[08:04:29] <shoky> code please
[08:04:45] <ph0n3tic> If I console log the returned object though, everything is correct, which is super wierd...
[08:04:46] <shoky> not descriptions of what you think the code is doing
[08:04:47] <ph0n3tic> one sec
[08:05:40] <DeltaHeavy> To be fair we need both of those things :p
[08:06:46] <ph0n3tic> http://pastebin.com/DR3eKvJx
[08:07:23] <shoky> moar.
[08:07:42] <ph0n3tic> that's all it is
[08:08:09] <shoky> how do you know it's returning blog_elem
[08:08:46] <shoky> and how did you define/select blog_elem
[08:15:56] <ph0n3tic> shoky: I've done more digging. Right after I change the element's class (add and remove), if I print out the html of the parent element, that element I changed appears unchanged.
[08:16:26] <BillCriswell> malorie: This is being a bit of a pain haha. Still looking at it though
[08:16:29] <BillCriswell> It's become personal.
[08:16:30] <shoky> ph0n3tic: and my questions?
[08:17:09] <jop008> how to get the value of a select field (single select)
[08:17:26] <ph0n3tic> blog_elem is just an element grabbed with a previous seletor (based on a data attr).
[08:17:45] <tomasm-> hi with the UI resizable tool,  is it possible to have a callback as the resize is happening, with the accurate coordinates? I am trying to have a second object resize as I am resizing the main object. I was hoping it was possible as it resizes and not after the resize is done
[08:17:47] <ph0n3tic> I know it is returning it, because I am comoaring the objects in the console
[08:17:52] <ph0n3tic> comparing*
[08:18:25] <shoky> comparing what part of them
[08:18:47] <SuperTyp> I have implemented the jquery-file-upload-plugin of blueimp into my wordpress page (php) when I upload a picture the upload works, but the problem is there are no animations, but the console doesn't show any errors what can I do, to fix this?
[08:19:43] <ph0n3tic> shoky: same data attributes (id) which isn't being changed. blog_elem is unique, only one exists in the parent element
[08:20:39] <ph0n3tic> shoky: how is this even possible? http://i.imgur.com/248V301.png
[08:21:07] <ph0n3tic> see how the 0 element has different classes? that is what is causing my issues
[08:21:52] <tech> anyone know of a good tut for putting a scrollbar on top of the element rather than the default of below
[08:23:29] <shoky> ph0n3tic: i'm not sure what im seeing in that log to be honest
[08:23:48] <Emwat> Hello?
[08:23:49] <BillCriswell> shoky: I'm trying to stop this scrolling when the user scrolls. What the hell am I doing wrong? http://jsbin.com/epajeg/1/edit
[08:24:24] <shoky> ph0n3tic: but none of that looks like it has an id
[08:24:28] <ph0n3tic> shoky: why are the class names different, for the same element
[08:25:15] <ph0n3tic> see how the zeroth element has .group read, then when you look inside this jquery array that same element is .group unread.
[08:25:19] <shoky> ph0n3tic: console.log($('.sidebar-nav').find('.read')[0],  $('.sidebar-nav').find('.read').get());
[08:25:27] <shoky> ph0n3tic:  take a screenshot of that
[08:25:36] <BillCriswell> shoky: Ah, ignore.
[08:26:13] <shoky> ph0n3tic:  do you see that little 'i' icon in the console, when you expand the array?
[08:26:21] <raggy> Wanting to listen for all (custom) events that bubble up to the document but stumped as to how to do it.. would like $(document).on(*, handler) any ideas?
[08:27:03] <ph0n3tic> shoky: yes, I do see that icon
[08:27:16] <shoky> ph0n3tic: hover over it
[08:27:42] <shoky> ph0n3tic: that might explain why it's different when you expand it. waiting for that screenshot
[08:28:52] <ph0n3tic> shoky: yah it says that the object state is captured upon first expansion.
[08:29:01] <ph0n3tic> screen shot coming
[08:29:30] <ph0n3tic> shoky: http://i.imgur.com/wnNYvxk.png
[08:29:31] <shoky> ph0n3tic: the expanded state can be different than the unexpanded state, due to that
[08:29:41] <shoky> raggy: i don't think you can do that
[08:29:47] <ph0n3tic> so ya, get() is wrong, but accessing the array directly is correct
[08:30:03] <shoky> what?
[08:30:09] <shoky> what do you mean, get() is wrong?
[08:30:18] <ph0n3tic> get() gives me the state before expansion
[08:30:27] <ph0n3tic> why would the state differ though?
[08:30:31] <ph0n3tic> that's what I don't get...
[08:30:59] <shoky> sometimes that happens because later code changes it
[08:31:03] <shoky> by the time you expand it
[08:31:06] <shoky> but uh
[08:31:29] <shoky> i'm not really familiar with that  "li.group read"  format for an element log
[08:31:54] <ph0n3tic> umm, its just an li element with classes .group and .read
[08:32:02] <jedimind> mind = blown.
[08:32:19] <shoky> ph0n3tic: that doesnt sound right. i'd expect  li.group.read  for that
[08:35:44] <shoky> ph0n3tic: console.log( $('.sidebar-nav').find('.read').is(blog_elem) );
[08:36:35] <shoky> no screenshot needed.. i'll take your word for a boolean ;p
[08:37:14] <jop008> I tried this for a select field $("country").val(); but undefined
[08:37:33] <shoky> jop008: a select field is not a <country> field
[08:37:39] <Saaether> country isnt a tag
[08:38:10] <DeltaHeavy> jop008: What's the HTML tag for that <input> tag? I'm assuming you wrote the HTML correctly :p
[08:38:57] <Emwat> Hey, I'm trying to add divs using jquery, but apparently I got the syntax wrong.  http://jsfiddle.net/rEhCH/
[08:39:18] <shoky> apparently
[08:40:06] <anjen> Hi I have a situationm whrere I need to identify if something has been embedded. I used the window.top!=window.self trick and it works fine for FF, Chrom, Safari but fails in IE8. Any suggestions?
[08:41:10] <jop008> I hope so
[08:41:16] <jop008> May I pm?
[08:42:04] <marl_scot> anyone able to tell me what i am doing wrong with this, it does not appear to be setting the time format or steps :(
[08:42:05] <marl_scot> $('#time').timepicker({	timeFormat: "G:i", step: "10" });
[08:42:13] <jop008> this is the html                 <select name="country" id="country" multiple="multiple" data-native-menu="false">
[08:42:41] <shoky> jop008:  $("country")  looks for a <country> tag
[08:42:52] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[08:43:25] <Bloomberg> $('select[name="country"]')
[08:43:41] <Bloomberg> $('select[name="country"]').val
[08:43:44] <Bloomberg> .val()
[08:43:44] <b-ot> Bloomberg: for form fields
[08:43:54] <Bloomberg> yes
[08:43:54] <DeltaHeavy> You could also, $('#country')
[08:44:26] <anjen> DeltaHeavy: woudln't that simply isolate an element with an id of 'country'?
[08:44:31] <Bloomberg> So, you can acces there like  ::  $('form select[name="country"]').val()
[08:44:50] <DeltaHeavy> anjen: Yeah, just like he's would do that with a name of country.
[08:44:53] <shoky> $('#country') is most efficient
[08:45:26] <DeltaHeavy> Personally, depending on what I'm doing and the complexity of the form, I, $('#someForm input').each
[08:45:26] <anjen> DeltaHeavy: ah...right. methinks I came into the conv a bit late
[08:45:29] <Bloomberg> you should test it, for to know what is the most efficient for you
[08:45:41] <shoky> Bloomberg:  $('#country') is most efficient, period
[08:45:49] <DeltaHeavy> ^
[08:46:08] <Bloomberg> Ok
[08:46:16] <jop008> You mean $('#country').val()
[08:46:24] <malorie> BillCriswell: how's it coming along? :->
[08:46:26] <shoky> .whatever()
[08:46:38] <BillCriswell> malorie: Shittily.
[08:46:44] <shoky> lol
[08:46:53] <Bloomberg> I have a question
[08:47:07] <anjen> I tend to use $('input#some_id_name').val(), jsut so I don't go crosseyed later on when Icome back and have to debug something I wrote months ago
[08:47:08] <Bloomberg> If I need to set some properties to tags less what have a specific id
[08:47:12] <Bloomberg> how can I get this?
[08:47:14] <Bloomberg> for example
[08:47:32] <Bloomberg> .my_class < #the_id{}
[08:47:36] <Bloomberg> is possible?
[08:47:49] <Bloomberg> exclude the tag what has that id
[08:48:00] <DeltaHeavy> "some properties to tags less what have a" I think you grammared that up, or am I misreading that?
[08:48:06] <anjen> Bloomberg: ? you mean $('.this_class').attr('id'); ?
[08:48:13] <Bloomberg> no
[08:48:21] <Bloomberg> css
[08:48:27] <Bloomberg> for example
[08:48:40] <jop008> My code is not working what to use for country field?
[08:48:55] <jop008> this $('select[name="country"]').val();?
[08:48:56] <anjen> still not sure what you meant I guess. are you trying to insert the id into the class?
[08:48:58] <shoky> Bloomberg:  maybe you mean $('#the_id').closest('.my_class')   donno
[08:49:20] <DeltaHeavy> Yeahâ€¦NO clue what you're saying lol
[08:49:22] <Bloomberg> all elements with this class ( .this_class ) but which has the id ( #some_id ) doesn't
[08:50:14] <anjen> Bloomberg, woudln't that be $('#some_id.some_class')
[08:50:25] <shoky> Bloomberg:  $('#some_id').parents('.my_class')
[08:50:25] <Bloomberg> jop008: Don't forget each one option from your select should to have a value  , so value="this"
[08:50:56] <shoky> Bloomberg: assuming of course that your ID's are unique as they should be
[08:51:18] <jop008> good tip my options are generated from database
[08:52:22] <Bloomberg> I believe stilll you hasn't undertood me!!
[08:52:38] <jop008> may the value without quote like this
[08:52:47] <jop008> <option ' + cselected +' value='+field.typeID
[08:52:56] <jop008> typeID = a number
[08:53:53] <Bloomberg> for example. I have two differents divs, I need share the same propertes but one property I don't need share, So I need to exclude from the selector... some like .my_class < #the_div{}
[08:57:53] <lamarus> Heyâ€¦ why would $("body:not('#tmp_content>*')").on('click' not work for putting the click handler on all elements in the body that is not contained within the #tmp_content
[08:58:11] <lamarus> currently it is allowing you to click on an element in #tmp_content and it still runs the click handler
[08:58:19] <BillCriswell> malorie: http://jsbin.com/epajeg/3/edit this works... but I feel like it could/should be a lot easier
[08:58:59] <BillCriswell> malorie: http://jsbin.com/epajeg/5/edit I meant
[08:59:42] <BillCriswell> Ugh, final edit: http://jsbin.com/epajeg/6/edit
[08:59:52] <BillCriswell> Got most of the guts from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7035896/detect-whether-scroll-event-was-created-by-user
[09:03:18] <malorie> BillCriswell: thanks, man. is it just me, or isn't it working in FF?
[09:03:38] <BillCriswell> Only looked in Chrome sadly. Got kind of annoyed with it and spent too much work time on it haha
[09:03:46] <malorie> :-)
[09:03:59] <malorie> I only need it to work in chrome anyway. so, much appreciated
[09:05:08] <BillCriswell> No problem haha
[09:06:27] <BillCriswell> I was thinking customEvents, but then every scroll event would need to be triggered like .trigger('scroll', ['User);
[09:06:35] <BillCriswell> I was thinking customEvents, but then every scroll event would need to be triggered like .trigger('scroll', ['User']);  *
[09:09:13] <Bloomberg> someone has worked with jTable JQuery plugin?
[09:10:09] <jop008> what ever I try I got underined for my country field
[09:10:48] <Bloomberg> Because is undefined*
[09:10:54] <Bloomberg> show us your code
[09:11:14] <jop008> this is what I tried chtml += "Country " + $('#country :selected').val();
[09:11:15] <jop008>     //chtml += $('select[name="country"]').val();
[09:11:16] <jop008>     //chtml += $("#country").val
[09:11:41] <Bloomberg> what is chtml?
[09:11:50] <tw2113> variable?
[09:11:51] <jop008> this is the append to the select field          $('#country').append('<option ' + cselected +' value="'+field.typeID+'">'+field["country_name"]+'</option>');
[09:13:04] <jqnoob> if I'm looking for elements with $(function(){ $('a[id^="edit"]').editable({ and then I load in data with .ajax, how do I find all of the elements again?
[09:14:40] <c4ptnh00k> FINALLY got it lol
[09:14:58] <c4ptnh00k> now just to hook up the event handler
[09:16:33] <jop008> this is my html select              <select name="country" id="country" multiple="single" data-native-menu="false">
[09:16:33] <jop008>    
[09:19:28] <c4ptnh00k> boobies
[09:19:55] <lamarus> Here is the fiddle for my issue  http://jsfiddle.net/vZ6eq/
[09:19:56] <jop008> So any help on my select field?
[09:20:04] <BillCriswell> jqnoob: You can just set them to a variable.
[09:20:48] <jqnoob> BillCriswell: How do I do that?
[09:20:56] <BillCriswell> jqnoob: var $editables = $('a[id^=edit]');  $editables.editable(); $editables.on('click', doThings );
[09:21:15] <jqnoob> I see click, is a click necessary?
[09:21:28] <BillCriswell> jqnoob: No. Just an example of how to do other stuff with it.
[09:21:54] <BillCriswell> You could even do $('a[id^=edit]').something({}).somethingElse(); but it can get unreadable pretty quickly.
[09:22:06] <jqnoob> BillCriswell: If I wanted to do it when the new data is loaded, would there be an event or something else besides click?
[09:22:45] <jqnoob> or is there a real good guide for newbies?
[09:22:56] <BillCriswell> jqnoob: You mean when .ediatable() is all finished doing it's thing?
[09:23:44] <jqnoob> BillCriswell: I'm loading data serverside with datatables and using a jquery inline editor, I need to parse/scan the new id's coming in.. did I explain that correctly? :(
[09:24:29] <BillCriswell> jqnoob: Yes. In that case you'd need to look for some kind of callback with datatables to run some stuff when it's all ready.
[09:25:35] <jqnoob> Thanks BillCriswell, off to get more twister.
[09:25:46] <BillCriswell> I don't know what that means.
[09:25:48] <BillCriswell> But ok.
[09:36:56] <lhunath> does removeClass take a pattern?  Like, $(this).removeClass("item-*")
[09:37:06] <NoiseEee> lhunath: no
[09:37:41] <lhunath> how would I implement that?
[09:38:44] <Saaether> lhunath http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1227286/get-class-list-for-element-with-jquery
[09:39:16] <Saaether> you would just need to make some slight changes
[09:43:15] <lhunath> so word-splitting class names is the correct way to split them?
[09:44:25] <lhunath> I wonder whether every browser would agree on an attr class="moo, cow"
[09:46:55] <lhunath> hmm.  my js weakness is showing now; but does if's == take a regex?  if (string == /re/) ?
[09:47:14] <c4ptnh00k> thats false
[09:47:49] <NoiseEee> lhunath: no but you can see IF something MATCHed ;)
[09:47:52] <lhunath> that was not the question.
[09:47:56] <lhunath> c4ptnh00k: ^
[09:48:04] <DarkGhost`> would I use jquery/javascript to make it when a div is display:none; all inputs inside do not get submitted?
[09:48:33] <NoiseEee> DarkGhost`: sure, but always know someone can submit the form anyhow if they know some JS etc
[09:49:14] <lhunath> so how would I test whether a string matches a regular expression?
[09:49:34] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match @ lhunath
[09:49:38] <ravenzz> ..
[09:49:44] <ravenzz> what about test?
[09:49:48] <ravenzz> :p
[09:50:07] <ravenzz> lhunath regex.test(string)
[09:50:32] <lhunath> cool.  so both objects can do so.
[09:50:51] <ravenzz> methods
[09:50:56] <ravenzz> test returns a boolean
[09:50:56] <NoiseEee> right, bit of syntax difference but you can either test a regex against a string, or test a string against a regexp :)
[09:51:13] <ravenzz> match returns an array of matches
[09:51:26] <DarkGhost`> NoiseEee, how would they do that? just disable js?
[09:51:58] <ravenzz> lhunath you should read about the two
[09:52:00] <lhunath> is /re/ anchor'ed by default or does it need ^ and $ to anchor?
[09:52:25] <NoiseEee> ravenzz / lhunath you can just:  if(myString.match(/regex/)) { //yeah baby there's a match }
[09:52:36] <gswain> really simple 4 line snippet http://pastebin.com/qNBbE2BZ can you help me figure out whats wrong?
[09:52:53] <NoiseEee> DarkGhost`: well they could go into a browser console and do something like document.getElementById('yourForm').submit()
[09:53:07] <ravenzz> NoiseEee but there is no reason to use match if you are interested into know if it matches or not
[09:53:10] <NoiseEee> DarkGhost`: just a(nother) example of why the real nuts-n-bolts of validation needs to be server-side
[09:53:22] <NoiseEee> ravenzz: might be quicker/more efficient?  dun really care :)
[09:53:48] <lhunath> umm; how safe is it to mutate an element's class attribute while iterating over it with $.each( $('body').attr('class').split(/\s+/), function(index, item){
[09:55:25] <ravenzz> lhunath that's a bad idea
[09:55:31] <DarkGhost`> NoiseEee, well it will be server-side but just for sakes of it not being submitted, I wish if the div was display:none it would disable the input's I don't want to go .each() them all
[09:55:45] <ravenzz> NoiseEee test is faster than match
[09:56:35] <lhunath> I figure I'm iterating the result of split which is probably a copy of the class attribute value; so modifying the attribute won't affect the split array.
[09:56:47] <gswain> SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list  -- 4 lines  please help me figure out whats wrong. http://pastebin.com/qNBbE2BZ
[09:57:09] <ravenzz> lhunath what are you trying to do?
[09:57:43] <DarkGhost`> whats difference between .attr and .prop?
[09:58:35] <ravenzz> DarkGhost` http://lmgtfy.com/?q=difference+between+attr+and+prop
[09:58:59] <NoiseEee> http://pastebin.com/NEQcpmyS  @ gswain
[10:00:56] <DarkGhost`> your the best ravenzz!
[10:01:27] <Saaether> lhunath http://jsfiddle.net/sV6Ay/ here i made a plugin for removing classes based on pattern
[10:02:36] <DarkGhost`> I'm looking in jqurery doc
[10:02:42] <ravenzz> Saaether what is this document.getElementById($this.attr('id')).className.split(/\s+/); ? -.-
[10:02:47] <DarkGhost`> but I can't find what $("form > input") does, wahts the > ?
[10:02:53] <gswain> NoiseEee: Thanks!!
[10:03:17] <Saaether> ravenzz that gets a list of all classes for the object
[10:03:32] <ravenzz> lhunath tbh I think you shouldn't see at that example. Can you tell us what are you trying to do?
[10:03:35] <jop008> I tried this for a single select field    var val = $("country").find(":selected").val();
[10:03:39] <jop008> but no way
[10:03:48] <ravenzz> Saaether yeah but why document.getElementById($this.attr('id'))?
[10:04:11] <ravenzz> that's not a good example sorry
[10:04:57] <lhunath> ravenzz: remove all the bg-* classes from body.

[10:10:56] <lhunath> ravenzz: also mutilates abg-moo
[10:12:04] <ravenzz> yeah that would be the lazy way
[10:12:20] <ravenzz> let me write the better one
[10:12:24] <Saaether> ravenzz fine, http://jsfiddle.net/sV6Ay/1/ fixed the ugly line\
[10:12:51] <lhunath> /(\s|^)bg-[^\s]+/g
[10:13:58] <lhunath> does JS understand \S?
[10:14:11] <lhunath> (as a replacement for [^\s])
[10:15:13] <DarkGhost`> $("#Details > input").each(function(){alert($(this).attr('name'));});
[10:15:17] <DarkGhost`> shouldn't that Alert all inputs in details?
[10:16:46] <ravenzz> lhunath yeah
[10:17:29] <lhunath> so /(^|\s)bg-\S+/g
[10:18:41] <Musk> anyone i have an element <ul> which needs to be triggered when a child element is swipped.
[10:18:56] <Musk> how to peform ? :/

[10:24:14] <FireRogue> Hello. I seem to be incapable of finding a list of all the properties/functions of a jQuery object. Can somebody help me out?

[10:55:43] <robbiet480> Hi, seems my jQuery UI 1.10.0 has suddenly stopped working with resizable in Chrome, Safari and Firefox, only on Mac though. Tested on multiple machines, already checked for a ticket/bug and didn't find one. Is anyone having similar issues
[10:55:51] <robbiet480> the handles just arent there
[10:56:31] <jmmy> you know this method .data, its a javascript method, jquery?
[10:56:50] <jmmy> all dom elements have a .data() method?
[10:57:40] <Kambfhase> .data() is a jQ method
[10:57:54] <Kambfhase> data is stored in an internal jQuery cache
[10:58:10] <jmmy> Kambfhase, thx
[10:58:14] <Kambfhase> but .data() can read the data attribute. But it does not set it
[10:58:36] <robbiet480> hm
[10:58:37] <robbiet480> blindMoe:
[10:58:38] <robbiet480> hm
[10:58:42] <robbiet480> name sounds familiar
[10:59:18] <jmmy> $(getElementName(this)) is a javascript method right?
[10:59:18] <blindMoe> robbiet480: yeap... I know you
[10:59:23] <blindMoe> robbiet480: momentum
[10:59:28] <robbiet480> blindMoe: yes i was just being cute
[10:59:29] <robbiet480> hi
[10:59:32] <blindMoe> David came out last week and visited
[10:59:35] <robbiet480> orly
[11:03:17] <jmmy> var elem = $(getElementName(this)), bg = elem.css("background"); is same as var elem = $(getElementName(this)); var bg = elem.css("background"); right?
[11:05:06] <Kambfhase> jmmy: what is "getElementName" supposed to do?
[11:06:09] <jmmy> Kambfhase, not sure, I am reading a book
[11:07:16] <Kambfhase> ok, but basically the two ways are the same, yes.
[11:07:32] <jmmy> Kambfhase, thx

[11:30:41] <Bloomberg> Afternoon guys!!
[11:30:50] <Bloomberg> I have a problem!!
[11:31:11] <Bloomberg> I'm working with Jtable JQuery plugin
[11:31:26] <Danny^^P> Hi! Anyone here with experience in layout of w2ui? (http://w2ui.com/web/demo/layout)
[11:32:11] <Bloomberg> I have cascade drop downs
[11:32:16] <Kambfhase> malorie: you have to get the mouse position and then do good old maths,
[11:32:31] <malorie> Kambfhase: fair enough :-)
[11:32:34] <malorie> thanks for the input
[11:32:43] <Bloomberg> But the problem is that When I show the dropw down row show all records from the data base
[11:32:51] <Bloomberg> I need only show me the data of this record
[11:33:35] <Kambfhase> bkfitz: you code contains a syntax error!
[11:34:19] <Kambfhase> or rather three of the same kind.
[11:35:05] <Kambfhase> and you overwrite your data, for some reason.
[11:35:17] <marl_scot> anyone able to spot a problem with this? the date picker is showing fine, but it isnt using the set date format (it is just using the default format) : $(function() { $('#date').datepicker({ dateFormat : "yy-mm-dd" }); })
[11:35:37] <bkfitz> Kambfhase: yeah... it was a sample I found online somewhere... clearly doesn't work and I'm just learning so hard for me to troubleshoot
[11:35:41] <bkfitz> getting there though...
[11:36:20] <Kambfhase> bkfitz: paste your code here, to check if it is valid: http://jslint.com/
[11:36:33] <Kambfhase> ^that tool is awesome!
[11:37:06] <bkfitz> Kambfase: yeah... i was using that last night... it is piiiiiicky :) thx
[11:37:31] <bkfitz> Kambfhase: love it though... really good for teaching proper syntax
[11:38:11] <Kambfhase> This one is less picky: // Your code goes here.
[11:38:24] <Kambfhase> http://jshint.com/
[11:38:27] <Kambfhase> FAIL
[11:41:31] <malorie> Kambfhase: I got it to work. do you happen to know how'd I go about also making the mover draggable right after the mousedown? such that I don't have to click and then drag, but rather do it in one move?
[11:41:33] <bkfitz> Everytime i put jquery in jslint though it says $ is undefined
[11:42:38] <Kambfhase> bkfitz: well, jslint doesnt know you use jQuery, or does it?
[11:43:09] <Kambfhase> malorie: sorry, no. there might be an option for that whough.
[11:43:25] <malorie> in jquery ui?
[11:43:36] <bkfitz> well... i included the script tag
[11:44:16] <bkfitz> ... which it doesn't like :)
[11:44:24] <bkfitz> Unexpected '<'.
[11:44:37] <Eviltwin> ... JavaScript only
[11:44:46] <Eviltwin> HTML is not JavaScript
[11:45:01] <bkfitz> so how can i get jslint to check my jquery?
[11:46:18] <Eviltwin> bkfitz: See if adding this before your code is enough: http://pastebin.com/vRAg3vLt
[11:46:30] <Kambfhase> Please just use jshint and select the jQuery option
[11:46:47] <bendman> is there a way to manipulate an entire detached document, from <html> to </html>?  jquery appears to strip everything outside of the body tag
[11:46:52] <Eviltwin> Or that
[11:47:15] <bkfitz> Kambfhase: ok :)
[11:53:07] <amcsi> is my psu fan supposed to point towards the floor if the psu opening of my case is at the bottom?
[11:53:13] <amcsi> wrong channel
[11:54:07] <snover> soooo wrong.
[11:54:23] <Kambfhase> amcsi: try $('case').css('rotate','180deg').show()
[11:55:24] <amcsi> there are holes for a fan there at the bottom
[11:59:44] <leo-the-manic> I name all my functions that return jQuery lists with a leading dollar sign. E.g. $getFormLinks(). Is there already a community consensus on that? Is it considered an anti-pattern or something?
[12:01:50] <nsanden> hi, im trying to figure out how to use bootstrap wizard.. http://jsfiddle.net/cYVz5/3/ i just want to be able to click my custom next button and have it page to next tab
[12:01:56] <jbkkd> bkfitz: jshint supports jQuery(tick the checkbox at the bottom)
[12:02:28] <nsanden> oops, i dont have that setup right yet
[12:02:59] <Kambfhase> leo-the-manic: prefixing jQ collections with $ is consider a beginners thingie
[12:03:36] <nsanden> ok now i do, http://jsfiddle.net/cYVz5/4/
[12:03:42] <bkfitz> thx guys... jslint and jshint are always telling me to "use strict";.... is this needed in every function?  once in the global space??
[12:04:02] <bkfitz> I realize what it does/means, just want to know what proper use is
[12:04:21] <Kambfhase> you can simply put it to the very top of you js file
[12:04:46] <Azra-el> hello and excuse me but.. is this a bad place to ask if somebody is willing to do some freelance work?
[12:05:47] <brettster> I'll do it.
[12:05:52] <brettster> depending on budget
[12:06:20] <nsanden> anyone familiar with bootstrap wizard plugin, i just want to use $('#rootwizard').bootstrapWizard('next') but its not doing anything
[12:06:24] <nsanden> http://jsfiddle.net/cYVz5/4/
[12:06:31] <bkfitz> Kambfhase: but then it tells me to use the 'function form of use strict' so ive just been putting it in the first line of my self invoking anony functino
[12:07:09] <Kambfhase> If you dont know, why and when to use it. Ditch it. Doesnt matter anyways.
[12:08:10] <jbkkd> in jshint you can disable the strict error by checking the box off
[12:08:18] <jbkkd> not required in your case I guess
[12:09:06] <skypce> hello people
[12:09:13] <skypce> what i doing wrong please? $(".take span").hover(function () {$(this).animate({scaleY:1.1,scaleX:1.1}, 1000)});
[12:09:14] <bkfitz> <- wishes he could get jslint/jshint suggestions directly in sublime
[12:09:35] <skypce> i need when hover a element increase .1 his size
[12:12:03] <Kambfhase> skypce: you should not use hover in that case.
[12:13:11] <bkfitz> :) http://opensourcehacker.com/2012/04/12/jslint-integration-for-sublime-text-2/
[12:15:07] <MadLems> this makes links open in new windows:  $('a[href^="http://"]').attr('target','_blank');  - am i correct that to make that only affect links on #foo, to just throw "#foo " before 'a[href... ?
[12:15:10] <jbkkd> bkfitz: you made my day
[12:15:29] <skypce> Kambfhase: $(".take:hover").animate({scaleY:1.1,scaleX:1.1}, 1000); ?
[12:15:38] <skypce> this code doesnt work
[12:16:08] <Kambfhase> no, you have to do two different scalings for up on hover and down on leave
[12:16:18] <Kambfhase> *mouseenter/mouseleave
[12:16:55] <skypce> thank you Kambfhase
[12:17:06] <marl_scot> Please could someone tell me how to make datepicker use 'yy-mm-dd' as its date format? I cant get it to work, and its a show stopper for my project :(
[12:18:17] <shoky> marl_scot: .datepicker({dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd'})
[12:20:55] <marl_scot> shoky, nope, not working :( that is what i had, and just copy/p[asted what you typed intot he code again, and still showing mm-dd-yy
[12:21:28] <bendman> any good reason why $('<html><body></body></html>') just returns <html></html>?
[12:21:43] <bendman> jquery keeps stripping out my body tag
[12:22:35] <shoky> marl_scot: works fine  http://jsfiddle.net/K2jXC/
[12:24:04] <pythonsnake> var row = $('<tr class="template-download fade"><td class="name"></td></tr>')
[12:24:22] <pythonsnake> row.find('tr') selects that .template-download right?
[12:24:48] <BillCriswell> pythonsnake: You would need to use .filter there
[12:24:48] <shoky> bendman: jquery uses .innerHTML for that. it's the browser stripping it out. it's all written here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[12:24:57] <NoiseEee> pythonsnake: row *is* the <tr>
[12:25:00] <dorgan> So I am trying to do the following   var obj = $(document); obj[bindMethod]('click',function(){console.log('test')});   why does that not work, and is there a way to get it to work
[12:25:02] <marl_scot> ok, any idea what may be missing that would allow date picker to work, but stop it from altering its format?
[12:25:10] <bendman> shoky: thanks
[12:25:19] <dorgan> bindMethod can either be "bind" or "once"
[12:25:22] <shoky> marl_scot: reproduce the issue in jsfiddle
[12:25:43] <pythonsnake> wait, so .addClass("form_field_error");?
[12:25:57] <pythonsnake> wait, so row.addClass("form_field_error");?*
[12:26:00] <BillCriswell> Also, exactly what NoiseEee said. I just asusme there's more than one <tr> in your example. Need to stop that lol.
[12:26:03] <BillCriswell> pythonsnake: Yes.
[12:26:09] <pythonsnake> ok thanks
[12:26:14] <shoky> marl_scot:  what i wrote is for initializing the datepicker. maybe you already initialized it with no dateFormat option.
[12:26:40] <jax> what type of http response should be returned if posting an ajaxForm and there are errors?
[12:26:43] <jax> 200 or 400 or?
[12:27:07] <dorgan> anyone?
[12:27:09] <BillCriswell> jax: 200 is successful.
[12:27:25] <BillCriswell> 400 is an error I believe. Failing on which kind right now, though
[12:27:34] <BillCriswell> Ah, bad request.
[12:27:36] <jax> yeah but is a form submit successful if not all data is provided?
[12:27:40] <jax> it is a good request
[12:27:42] <jax> just didn't validate
[12:27:45] <jax> so i guess i should be returning 200
[12:28:38] <shoky> dorgan: there's no "once"
[12:28:49] <BillCriswell> jax: Agreed.
[12:29:07] <dorgan> oh
[12:29:21] <dorgan> damn me confusing jQuery and ExtJs
[12:29:50] <jax> i'm currently returning 400
[12:29:53] <jax> but i think he is caching it...
[12:29:55] <jax> can that be?
[12:29:58] <jax> because getting wrong validation errors
[12:30:25] <jax> not sure if he's caching the post or the resposne
[12:31:22] <marl_scot> shoky, my source is here : http://pastebin.com/RgDUCWVR
[12:32:22] <shoky> marl_scot: doesnt look like you're including the datepicker plugin
[12:33:48] <BillCriswell> jax: I think that would trigger the error callback. I could be wrong, though.
[12:33:52] <BillCriswell> or fail().
[12:37:17] <marl_scot> shoky, have explicitly included the datepicker js, and still the same problem (http://pastebin.com/3rTqUtTw) i presumed before hand that the fact the datepicker was apearing at all, meant it was being included wiuth the jquery-ui-min.js file
[12:38:05] <shoky> marl_scot: you're not including any jquery-ui-min.js
[12:38:39] <marl_scot> jquery.ui.core.min.js
[12:38:42] <marl_scot> sorry
[12:38:59] <shoky> marl_scot:  that's just the core, no datepicker.
[12:40:05] <marl_scot> ok, now i have the datepicker in there as well, but still not working :(
[12:40:35] <unnu> shoky
[12:40:47] <unnu> have i mentioned to you that i hate the DOM because i don't understand it
[12:41:00] <jedimind> why did you eat the dom?
[12:41:05] <shoky> unnu perhaps
[12:41:16] <unnu> ughhh
[12:41:36] <shoky> marl_scot: donno why it's not working. the datepicker is showing fine just without the format?
[12:42:01] <marl_scot> shoky, yup, thats the frustrating thing :(
[12:42:02] <unnu> i made a multi-upload script using .append to a div some file input tags and the ones i append dont post, i are pissed off
[12:42:34] <marl_scot> am i correct in thinking that 'jquery-ui.js' should contain all the ui plugins?
[12:43:15] <unnu> i gotta hit the gym now, but when i get back ill post a fiddle
[12:43:27] <shoky> marl_scot: think so. what jqui version ?
[12:43:49] <marl_scot> 1-10.3
[12:44:28] <marl_scot> coul d it be some css problem? (which should be included first in a document? the css or the js?)
[12:46:00] <shoky> marl_scot: if you see the datepicker fine then there's no css prob
[12:46:15] <jmmy> whats this: (function($){ ... })(jQuery); is equivalent to $(function(){ ... }); ?
[12:47:11] <marl_scot> ok, i will strip the code, and try from very basic and see if i can get that working, thanks shoky , will get back to you :)
[12:47:28] <shoky> jmmy: no.  the first is an IIFE (immediately invoked function expression).  the second is a shortcut for $(document).ready(...)
[12:47:53] <jmmy> shoky, thx
[12:48:30] <jmmy> shoky, whats the difference?
[12:48:51] <Hooloovoo> jmmy: The first one doesn't wait for document ready event.
[12:49:09] <Hooloovoo> also it's safe for like conflicts
[12:49:15] <shoky> jmmy: the first has nothing to do with jquery, it's a javascript concept.  it's a function with one argument called $, that's immediately called, passing in jQuery as the argument
[12:49:26] <shoky> jmmy: so inside, you can be sure that $ === jQuery
[12:50:04] <shoky> jmmy: the 2nd is a jquery thing that waits for the DOM to be ready, it isn't immediately executed
[12:50:15] <jmmy> shoky, thx
[12:50:29] <jmmy> Hooloovoo, thx
[12:53:54] <jmmy> pusher.com is worth any of my time?
[12:54:41] <jmmy> I mean, you think pusher.com has a future,  gonna be big like jquery
[12:56:52] <ajmrsn> hi, how can I fix $.browser and d.browser is undefined issues and $(â€¦).uniform() is not a function problem? do these relate to different versions of jquery?
[12:58:24] <shoky> ajmrsn:  $.browser was removed in jquery 1.9 yes.  and .uniform() is just a plugin, not built-in to jquery
[12:58:31] <ajmrsn> oh ok
[12:58:57] <ajmrsn> the $.browser and d.browser errors come up from other plugins then
[12:59:04] <shoky> yes
[12:59:12] <marl_scot> shoky, thanks, found the problem, was a js file included with 'timepicker' called 'base.js' that was preventing the formatting from working, not sure why, but once i removed that js file, it worked
[12:59:41] <marl_scot> thank you for your help, have been banging my head agasint my keybaord all ay over that one.
[12:59:43] <shoky> marl_scot: glad to hear
[13:00:53] <ajmrsn> I found from a stackoverflow post that modernizr could help with the $.browser and d.browser undefined issue
[13:00:59] <ajmrsn> but I don't know how
[13:01:16] <ajmrsn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14798403/typeerror-browser-is-undefined
[13:01:18] <shoky> it doesn't magically solve the problem for you
[13:01:21] <ajmrsn> oh
[13:01:38] <malorie> how'd I go about detecting when my site gets scrolled to top?
[13:07:44] <lamarus> opinion of requiring dependencies on a jquery plugin?   things like tweenlite and easing?
[13:07:49] <shoky> malorie: handle the scroll event on the scrolled element (e.g. document) and inside check it's .scrollTop()
[13:09:06] <malorie> shoky: thanks
[13:11:25] <lhunath> what would I do to run a function whenever the bounds of an element change?
[13:12:31] <BillCriswell> lhunath: You mean like the width or the height?
[13:12:58] <lhunath> aye.  is that $(foo).resize?
[13:14:16] <BillCriswell> I don't think that would work on a div, just on window I believe.
[13:14:48] <BillCriswell> $(window).on('resize', doThings ) is cool, $('div')on('resize', doThings ) is nope.
[13:15:33] <BillCriswell> You'd need to use a customEvent more than likely to get that working.
[13:23:17] <psynor> have a newb question.  i just started playing with jquery today and so far I love it.  i am trying to make a page with some dynamic forms and I am using the following: $('#form_content').html("form 2");
[13:23:45] <eddiemonge> what is 2? that doesnt look like a html tag
[13:23:49] <psynor> is there a way that I can have an include or something so form2 is populated by an external html file?
[13:23:56] <eddiemonge> or are you jsut trying to clear out the form?
[13:24:00] <psynor> its just a placeholder
[13:24:10] <eddiemonge> ? jquery.load @ psynor
[13:24:11] <bot-t> psynor, .load() | jQuery API Documentation - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[13:25:20] <psynor> cool thanks
[13:25:43] <harbhub> hey fellas
[13:25:48] <harbhub> i need some help with the click event
[13:25:54] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ harbhub
[13:25:54] <b-ot> harbhub: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:25:54] <bot-t> harbhub, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:26:12] <harbhub> i'm trying to detect the click event on an image inside of a div
[13:26:47] <harbhub> <div class='thumbnails'><div class='thumb><img 1></div><div class='thumb'><img2></div></div>
[13:27:02] <harbhub> i want to know when those images (the thumbnails) are clicked
[13:27:11] <harbhub> but i don't want to detect when other images are clicked
[13:27:17] <harbhub> i'm using galleria
[13:28:14] <Kambfhase> $('div.thumb > img').on('click', function(){ someCode(); })
[13:28:58] <harbhub> why the greater than sign?
[13:29:33] <harbhub> $('div.thumbnails > div.thumb > img').on....
[13:29:36] <harbhub> will that also work?
[13:29:45] <harbhub> since i need to access from that main thumbnail div
[13:31:08] <basserselim_> yes.
[13:32:48] <guhcampos> I (a real js noob) am passing an array of arrays with $.ajax() to a webapp2 handler. Everything seems to be working fine, but my array arrives on the server with all array childs as "undefined" instead of showing it's contents. I'd really appreciate some enlightenment. Code and data here: http://pastie.org/8040345
[13:32:49] <lhunath> is there a way to prevent a text element from getting selected when double-clicked (it's supposed to behave more like a button)
[13:33:22] <harbhub> how do i that the event and determine what element was clicked?
[13:33:26] <harbhub> e.elementClicked
[13:35:43] <BillCriswell> harbhub: event.target should work
[13:35:55] <basserselim_> or just $(this)
[13:35:58] <harbhub> that returns an object
[13:36:20] <harbhub> e.target returns an object that i cannot JSON.stringify since it is circular
[13:36:23] <grafi> lhunath http://jsfiddle.net/chriscoyier/vGG8F/3/
[13:36:53] <shoky> it's an element, you can't stringify it
[13:37:38] <harbhub> e.target.nodeName returns that i'm clicking an img
[13:38:57] <basserselim_> what do you want to know? the id?
[13:39:01] <lhunath> grafi: any solution that works on IE? that's what the client is testing on -_-
[13:39:06] <lhunath> IE9.
[13:39:50] <lhunath> I tried .dblclick(function() { e.preventDefault(); }); // no luck.
[13:41:15] <grafi> ie9 yuck
[13:41:15] <harbhub> got it working
[13:41:22] <harbhub> $(e.target).is...
[13:41:46] <shoky> lhunath: try that with "selectstart" event
[13:42:20] <shoky> lhunath:  $(el).on('selectstart', function(e) { e.preventDefault() })
[13:42:25] <BillCriswell> harbhub: You could also probably use on like this: $('.parent').on('click', '.child', doSomething );
[13:43:06] <grafi> lhunath or this http://stackoverflow.com/a/4448972/826625
[13:43:49] <psynor> how does caching work when you use load?  I was using the .load operator to load html forms into a div and after updating the source html forms I am still seeing the old forms.  Is that just a browser cache issue?
[13:45:49] <BillCriswell> psynor: Seems like it.
[13:46:04] <BillCriswell> psynor: Are you working in Chrome?
[13:48:26] <NaOH_> I'm using jQuery mobile and simply putting a slash in the page hash like #/something causes a DOM Exception 18 security error in Chrome. Why is this?
[13:49:12] <lhunath> shoky: that seems to work, interesting.
[13:49:20] <lhunath> the selectstart event.
[13:50:41] <BillCriswell> Holy shit I'm bored.
[13:52:59] <Kambfhase> BillCriswell: wanna have somthign to do?
[13:53:26] <Kambfhase> BillCriswell: You can tell me, what you think of this idea: https://gist.github.com/Kambfhase/5773165
[13:53:34] <BillCriswell> Terrible
[13:53:38] <BillCriswell> Just kidding, I'll look.
[13:55:01] <Kambfhase> ^^
[13:55:23] <shoky> syntax error in your example
[13:56:07] <shoky> but uh..
[13:56:23] <Kambfhase> fixed.
[13:57:05] <blindMoe> What is the name of the chrome / firefox plugin that will show what javascript events are bound to an element?
[13:57:13] <blindMoe> I have seen it before but can't remember the name
[13:57:15] <shoky> Kambfhase: what's wrong with try..catch ?
[13:57:27] <c4ptnh00k> in bootstrap how do you make a dropdown of dropdowns?
[13:57:44] <Kambfhase> shoky: slows down your code afaik.
[13:59:26] <shoky> Kambfhase: i doubt that its anything significant, on modern browsers
[14:00:50] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: likefirequery?
[14:00:50] <NaOH_> does anyone have any ideas about putting slashes in hashes?
[14:01:05] <blindMoe> eddiemonge: possibly... let me go play with it and see :)
[14:01:36] <Kambfhase> NaOH: Twitter used to do that, so it should work
[14:01:51] <shoky> blindMoe: chrome devtools already shows that
[14:01:52] <BillCriswell> NaOH_: I'd have to see it.
[14:01:59] <blindMoe> shoky: where does it show it?
[14:02:12] <shoky> blindMoe:  Elements -> Event Listeneres
[14:02:14] <shoky> -e
[14:02:23] <blindMoe> beautiful .. thanks
[14:02:30] <blindMoe> prefer Chrome to FireFox any day
[14:03:20] <blindMoe> how did I never see that tab before....
[14:03:51] <BillCriswell> Ot
[14:03:59] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: It's kind of down there a good bit.
[14:04:21] <BillCriswell> Oh, wait... no it isn't.
[14:04:38] <blindMoe> haha it is if the styles tab is opened  :)
[14:04:50] <NaOH_> BillCriswell: With this simple example putting #/something at the end of the URL (on your local machine) will cause the error http://bpaste.net/show/zRi8tnRvnhDKSYCOKS0r/
[14:04:53] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: Depending on the element definitely.
[14:05:21] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: If you dock the console on the right and split it vertically it'll show up in a tab... Kind of cool.
[14:07:33] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: http://i.imgur.com/pO01mOY.png
[14:08:02] <blindMoe> ahh nice... I have mine in a seperate window so the layout is a bit different
[14:08:25] <BillCriswell> Yeah, the split option is only available for when you're docking on the right for whatever reason..
[14:10:42] <BillCriswell> NaOH_: It looks like #whatever/foo.html is fine, just not #/whatever/foo.html
[14:10:59] <NaOH_> BillCriswell: any thoughts?
[14:11:07] <NaOH_> BillCriswell: oops
[14:11:09] <BillCriswell> Guess it's just how it's designed.
[14:11:13] <BillCriswell> Why do you need to do that?
[14:11:21] <NaOH_> BillCriswell: didn't see that last message
[14:11:35] <NaOH_> BillCriswell: i'm using ember.js
[14:12:04] <NaOH_> BillCriswell: it's just what ember.js does i guess
[14:12:36] <BillCriswell> Ah, not familiar with either enough to be of any good help probably.
[14:15:38] <jmmy> irc is a real time web app?
[14:15:39] <NaOH_> BillCriswell: thanks anyways!
[14:16:26] <jedimind> wat
[14:16:56] <jmmy> c'mon, am I wispering? its text
[14:17:45] <shoky> wat
[14:18:10] <jedimind> cant tell it troll
[14:18:11] <jedimind> or worse
[14:18:18] <jmmy> pusher is good?
[14:18:56] <shoky> never heard of it before you asked about it earlier
[14:19:05] <jedimind> what is pusher
[14:19:10] <NoiseEee> jmmy: irc and the web use different protocols
[14:19:15] <shoky> www.pusher.com
[14:19:52] <t_kjaergaard> shoky: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/getting-real-time-with-pusher/?search_index=1
[14:19:54] <jmmy> NoiseEee, I know
[14:21:18] <shoky> irc is older than the web i think
[14:21:22] <jedimind> yup
[14:21:29] <jedimind> irc existed before the internet
[14:21:37] <jedimind> people used to write messages on paper, then attach them to pigeons

[14:24:58] <bjorn_> has anyone worked with a multi image carousel?
[14:25:16] <bjorn_> as in multiple images ; on one slide
[14:25:36] <bjorn_> i  found a bootstrap carousel thing to do what i want
[14:25:39] <bjorn_> but the problem is
[14:25:49] <bjorn_> i need multiple images
[14:26:26] <gaplus> Has anyone here used require.js previously?
[14:26:44] <shoky> nobody, ever
[14:27:10] <bjorn_> so yea
[14:27:18] <bjorn_> multi image slider
[14:27:23] <bjorn_> anyone any recommondations
[14:35:00] <neybar_work> is there a method that given an element returns itself as well as it's internal html?  Basically I want .html() to return the current element as well as what is contained in it.
[14:36:37] <jmmy> neybar_work, huh, confused, it does exactly what you asked
[14:37:25] <neybar_work> no, $('.some_thing').html() returns everything that it encloses, but not itself.
[14:37:34] <jmmy> you need the element first, then you can call html() on the element, so you call it on the element
[14:37:55] <jmmy> itself is .some_thing
[14:41:16] <neybar_work> ex: <div class=a><i>h</i></div> $('.a').html() returns "<i>h</i>"  I'd like the html to include the div bit, along with any attributes
[14:41:47] <neybar_work> unfortunately just grabbing a parent is too much, since there is other stuff.
[14:43:06] <Draxelis> On click I do this : $('li.item-a').parent().css('background-color', 'red');  And when click on another element, it should undo the css change, how to achieve that?
[14:43:29] <jmmy> $('.a').parent().html() or just give the parent an id and call it on that instead
[14:43:37] <fikst> neybar_work, $('.a').andSelf().html()
[14:44:08] <Draxelis> hi jmmy :)
[14:44:16] <jmmy> Draxelis, sup
[14:44:26] <Draxelis> preparing jsfiddle :)))
[14:44:29] <fikst> neybar_work, use andBack()
[14:44:35] <fikst> andSelf() is depricated
[14:46:17] <Draxelis> http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/17/
[14:46:21] <Draxelis> jmmy,
[14:46:39] <Draxelis> remember this?
[14:47:01] <Draxelis> When new click is done, the background should get back to initial state
[14:47:19] <fikst> Draxelis, use addCLass en removeCLass
[14:47:22] <Draxelis> background-color*
[14:48:04] <jmmy> Draxelis, 1 sec, let me see
[14:49:37] <fikst> Draxelis, http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/18/
[14:49:50] <Draxelis> ok let me see:)
[14:50:21] <fikst> but, still better to use addClass
[14:50:29] <fikst> styling should be in css, not js
[14:50:33] <Draxelis> oh
[14:50:33] <Draxelis> haha
[14:50:33] <Draxelis> smart
[14:50:33] <Draxelis> :D
[14:50:40] <Draxelis> ye I agree
[14:50:51] <Draxelis> nice trick tho
[14:51:06] <jmmy> can you have two functions for click() like you do with hover()?
[14:51:20] <Draxelis> no idea
[14:52:57] <Eviltwin> jmmy: The two functions doing what?
[14:53:15] <Draxelis> fikst,  so on every click, it clears background color of all lis. Is this efficient?
[14:53:19] <jmmy> EvilEmpire, mouse over and mouse out
[14:54:04] <fikst> cannot think of an other way to do it
[14:54:17] <jmmy> EvilEmpire, if you add two functions, like hover's mouse over and mouse out, will click() automatically set them as odd and even clicks?  Probably not.
[14:55:13] <jmmy> Draxelis, didn't that dude show you how.
[14:55:20] <jmmy> fikst, you can add and remove class instead
[14:55:43] <fikst> yes, I told him
[14:55:43] <jmmy> Draxelis, remember .ontext and .offtext
[14:55:54] <fikst> principle is the same
[14:56:06] <jmmy> fikst, no some other dude showed him how to do it for each individual items instead of a list items
[14:56:06] <fikst> remove class from all elements, and add again for current element
[14:56:20] <Draxelis> hm
[14:56:33] <Draxelis> ye showed ontext offtext
[14:56:33] <Draxelis> :D
[14:56:36] <jmmy> Draxelis, but really, doing for all items is fine
[14:56:43] <Draxelis> ok
[14:57:12] <Draxelis> it doesnt slow down site or smth?  I mean on slow mobiles and stuff:)
[14:57:13] <fikst> ok, you could also store the current active element in a var, so you don't have to remove the background from all of them
[14:57:33] <fikst> but just use the one stored in the var
[14:57:47] <fikst> that would be better for perfomance
[15:00:55] <Draxelis> :)
[15:01:05] <Draxelis> fikst,  did your way
[15:01:06] <Draxelis> works
[15:01:24] <Draxelis> hopefully it isnt that bad.
[15:01:26] <Draxelis> :)
[15:23:30] <bob-98274> Is there a "standard" method to create a combo-box from a <select>?  I have played with a few of the jquery-ui "completed version of the example (http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox ) but none of them seem to work too well "out of the box".
[15:24:08] <bob-98274> Tend to be really slow or have styling issues...
[15:24:26] <geekbuntu> which ones have you looked at?
[15:26:18] <zizzl> Hey guys is there a simple way to achieve just the section that scrolls horizontally in this website http://wildbluetech.com/ I don't need any of the other paralax, I just want a section in my website to achieve that horizontal scrolling then continue

[15:40:39] <zizzl> Anyone?
[15:42:21] <Eviltwin> zizzl: Missed your question. Can you repeat it?
[15:43:24] <zizzl> Hey guys is there a simple way to achieve just the section that scrolls horizontally in this website http://wildbluetech.com/ I don't need any of the other paralax, I just want a section in my website to achieve that horizontal scrolling then continue
[15:45:19] <Eviltwin> zizzl: I think I see how this is working
[15:45:23] <Eviltwin> Let me see if I can make a demo of it
[15:46:33] <zizzl> Eviltwin, you the man!
[15:47:38] <affine> just posted this problem http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17098464/jquery-ui-draggable-css-transform-causes-jumping

[16:00:43] <Draxelis> everyone who has helped, you are welcome! :)
[16:04:28] <Eviltwin> zizzl: It's not quite there, but this is the idea:             top: '50px',

[16:04:37] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/ctuWk/
[16:05:21] <Eviltwin> A few of those numbers need a little tweaking for it to be perfect

[16:05:44] <zizzl> but thanks so much man I appreciate it!
[16:08:22] <hyperking> hello everyone, I need help animating a nav li background that sets a default state after hover out..here is a link to my code im working on http://bpaste.net/show/ho8bjszQgz1DFmwtEurd/
[16:14:11] <Eviltwin> hyperking: You know that .css(...) on line 9 will run before the animation, right?
[16:14:21] <Eviltwin> And that .stop() will prevent the animation from ever running
[16:15:12] <hyperking> Well, how would i set the css value back to the default after hover out?
[16:15:23] <potatoCannon> if I'm binding events (using 'on') to elements in jQM, what's the correct event or set of events (say 'click tap') to bind to? And do I have a timeout of some kind to prevent two events firing for the one tap/click?
[16:15:31] <hyperking> eviltwin: ^
[16:15:57] <Eviltwin> hyperking: You mean after the animation?
[16:16:02] <potatoCannon> is there a onComplete function for that?
[16:16:07] <hyperking> eviltwin: yes!
[16:16:32] <Eviltwin> hyperking: You want to use the complete callback function of animate documented here: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:16:53] <potatoCannon> animate({ /* something */, function() { /* on complete */ });
[16:17:05] <potatoCannon> oops, missed a }
[16:17:51] <Eviltwin> So something lime .animate({backgroundPosition: '-273px 48px'}, 300, function () { $(this).css({...}) })
[16:17:57] <Eviltwin> something like*
[16:18:08] <Eviltwin> And get rid of that .stop() for now at least
[16:18:23] <Eviltwin> See if you're now getting the desired effect before adding it back
[16:18:33] <Eviltwin> It definitely shouldn't be where it is now
[16:19:20] <potatoCannon> just going to repeat myself here, just in case
[16:19:24] <potatoCannon> if I'm binding events (using 'on') to elements in jQM, what's the correct event or set of events (say 'click tap') to bind to? And do I have a timeout of some kind to prevent two events firing for the one tap/click?
[16:20:27] <Eviltwin> potatoCannon: I think you can just use tap: http://api.jquerymobile.com/tap/
[16:21:16] <hyperking> eviltwin: is this right? or do i need to call a .complete http://bpaste.net/show/Ee2WRy9aEg0CCL9zkCHg/
[16:21:21] <potatoCannon> I've been switching between tap and click, but I'll try again. Tried it again and got a call stack error but that's probably on me
[16:21:41] <potatoCannon> as in, switching for all events, not just invidually
[16:21:50] <potatoCannon> individually*
[16:22:11] <Eviltwin> hyperking: Colder
[16:22:17] <Eviltwin> hyperking: You want something like this: http://bpaste.net/show/JCuRyE3AWNbZFxXM4kwy/
[16:23:56] <hyperking> eviltwin: THANKS! is this a "chaining" method?
[16:24:35] <hyperking> eviltwin: why would is it necessary to call the complete as a function?
[16:24:48] <Eviltwin> I've passed a callback function into .animate()
[16:25:00] <Eviltwin> Which is a function that gets run once the animation has completed
[16:25:01] <potatoCannon> what's the second argument in .css?
[16:25:14] <Eviltwin> Oh, yeah, that shouldn't be there
[16:25:37] <Eviltwin> Unless that's some crazy jQuery UI thing
[16:26:27] <potatoCannon> nah, I double checked
[16:26:40] <potatoCannon> well
[16:27:14] <Eviltwin> 'Cause jQuery UI adds this business: http://api.jqueryui.com/addClass/
[16:27:17] <hyperking> What im attempting to do is move a background image thats 300px from 300px to 150px(hoverstate) and contine to move it to 0px(the default state)..if that made sencse
[16:27:17] <potatoCannon> nope
[16:27:25] <Eviltwin> But why add a duration to .css when you have .animate?
[16:27:49] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ hyperking
[16:27:49] <b-ot> hyperking: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:29:58] <hyperking> b-ot: here is an example of the rollover im attempting to recreate. except without all the div insertions http://www.arsthanea.com/clients/
[16:30:17] <quuxman> Is there a standard function for the union of foo.filter and foo.find?
[16:31:06] <potatoCannon> are you talking about the line below the logos?
[16:33:29] <potatoCannon> in that case, that white 'border' could be a 1px high div. and inside that is a zero length div that you animate (width) to fill the 'border'
[16:33:39] <quuxman> or do I have to do something like $(foo.find(bar) + foo.filter(bar)) ?
[16:34:51] <potatoCannon> Eviltwin: yeah, so just tap works. Noob/lazy mistake on my part (was doing 'find/replace' and caught some of my .click()'s) No more touch delay, phew!
[16:35:39] <hyperking> potatoCannon: Yes!..working on fiddle stuff. but Eviltwin helped me resolve this so im just providing example for others.
[16:36:03] <Eviltwin> ?add @ quuxman
[16:36:17] <Eviltwin> quuxman: http://api.jquery.com/add/
[16:37:15] <quuxman> Eviltwin: so you're saying no, there's not
[16:39:42] <Eviltwin> quuxman: What the hell do you mean by $(foo.find(bar) + foo.filter(bar))
[16:39:45] <quuxman> Eviltwin: and yes, my code is completely broken
[16:39:55] <quuxman> Eviltwin: I mean this, which is pretty awkward: elements.filter('[data-menu-handle]').add(elements.find('[data-menu-handle]'))
[16:40:34] <Eviltwin> Well that's a really expensive .find()
[16:40:51] <Eviltwin> That's a full DOM walk under each of those elements
[16:41:33] <quuxman> only happens once. I'm not too concerned
[16:41:46] <Eviltwin> Then you can live with the awkwardness once
[16:42:00] <quuxman> you think I should use a class selector?
[16:42:43] <hyperking> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/A37yM/
[16:42:50] <Eviltwin> quuxman: It'd be faster
[16:42:51] <hyperking> potatoCannon: http://jsfiddle.net/A37yM/
[16:43:05] <Eviltwin> If it's happening just once and those are small trees I wouldn't worry
[16:43:15] <potatoCannon> tanks for the quick assist, I like this channel, helps with my understanding, but alas, I'm on company time. This place is distractingly helpful
[16:43:21] <hyperking> Somehow my line image is not showing up in the fiddle. but the url is correct
[16:44:20] <potatoCannon> sorry, gotta go
[16:45:26] <Eviltwin> hyperking: This is the only image I see referenced: http://hyperkingmedia.com/assets/img/line.gif
[16:45:38] <Eviltwin> hyperking: Are you going through all this hassle for a 2px-thick line?
[16:45:56] <hyperking> Eviltwin: YEs!!
[16:46:20] <Eviltwin> Well can you at least try to get the image lined up where it's supposed to be for us?
[16:46:42] <Eviltwin> Right now your fiddle looks no different from this: http://jsfiddle.net/A37yM/1/
[16:49:02] <Eviltwin> I think you're also going to need to animate background-position-x and background-position-y instead of just background-position
[16:49:10] <Eviltwin> jQuery's not going to like the two separate numbers
[16:49:36] <hyperking> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/A37yM/2/ not sure if jquery is loading
[16:50:26] <Shazz> Is it possible to redirect to an IP and setting a custom request header.
[16:50:53] <Eviltwin> hyperking: http://jsfiddle.net/A37yM/3/
[16:51:04] <Eviltwin> Shazz: Not with jQuery, no
[16:51:25] <Shazz> Eviltwin: Any other way that you know of?
[16:51:34] <Eviltwin> Shazz: No
[16:52:10] <Shazz> Hmm, okay. I might use PHP cURL to do make a request and just render it.
[16:52:21] <Eviltwin> Okay, be careful
[16:54:51] <hyperking> Eviltwin: why use BackgroundPositionX? the other way worked fine and less typing :-)
[16:56:05] <quuxman> Eviltwin: there should really be a flag to .find or a .findAll that does this
[16:56:25] <Eviltwin> quuxman: No, there really doesn't need to be
[16:56:34] <Eviltwin> hyperking: Except it didn't?
[16:57:10] <Eviltwin> hyperking: This looks pretty not working for me: http://jsfiddle.net/A37yM/4/
[16:57:11] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, I have two tabs called 'originals' and 'posters' and under each tab, I have a different gallery.  The problem is when I first load the page, both galleries end up on one page.  Clicking through the tabs fixes this but it's only when the page firsts loads. could anyone please help? http://jsfiddle.net/VRAht/2/
[16:57:46] <Eviltwin> hyperking: Also, I'd just remove the .stop()s personally
[16:58:45] <hyperking> Eviltwin: agreed! but when i use the X and Y locally it fails and the other method works. I think the fiddle app isn't loading the jquery lib
[16:59:23] <Eviltwin> You mean isn't loading jQuery?
[16:59:52] <Eviltwin> If that were the case, changing the stuff in the bottom left panel wouldn't change how it works
[17:01:22] <CocoStorm> anyone?
[17:02:09] <Eviltwin> CocoStorm: Why are you using jQuery 1.10.1?
[17:02:42] <CocoStorm> EvilEmpire, well I'm actually using 1.9.1
[17:05:53] <astomp> hey guys have anyone suffered with unresponsive buttons? The button is used to add dynamically a form with only one text input and when the user click out of this input the form is replaced by the button again. The problem is when i click on the button and click out from the input, sometimes, the button or the click out stop responding. Anyone know something that could help me with that?
[17:08:09] <CocoStorm> anyone?
[17:12:42] <__machine> is there an equivalent to the livequery plugin for jquery 1.7+ ? i was using it to dynamically add .last-child classes to :last-child selectors

[18:41:49] <stan_man_can> After you hit "ok" it fire again, after 3 fires it stops
[18:43:14] <systemfault> You have something that runs that code 3 times..
[18:43:21] <systemfault> Because that code is just fine.
[18:43:45] <stan_man_can> Odd
[18:44:23] <stan_man_can> it's not wrapped or anything
[18:50:44] <stan_man_can> systemfault: have you used bootstrap at all? I feel like it's doing something funny when i submit
[18:51:01] <systemfault> A bit.
[18:52:49] <stan_man_can> if i left or right click on the submit button (<button type="submit">) submits which i find odd
[18:52:57] <stan_man_can> well, i find the right click part odd
[18:53:02] <systemfault> It's not odd
[18:53:09] <systemfault> It's the default behavior
[18:53:16] <systemfault> Ahh
[18:53:23] <systemfault> For the right-click.. I don`t know
[19:15:55] <CapMax> hi
[19:16:07] <CapMax> is there any easy way to get the date range of this week/month, etc
[19:16:16] <CapMax> calendar
[19:55:08] <Pinkamena_D> When using the datetime-local polyfill, I get NaN problems in internet explorer
[19:55:36] <Pinkamena_D> I thought It was supposed to decect automatically?
[20:12:25] <affine> is there a way to transform something from absolute positioning into relative positioning?
[20:12:32] <affine> without it actually changing position on the page
[20:33:36] <otiuk> when i add a LI element to a sortable ul and in the LI it has a link that has a class that has a .click action and it's suppose to delete the closest LI but it doesn't even register as an event/action
[20:34:30] <Gazpacho> is the click action set before the li is added?
[20:34:40] <Gazpacho> bad question
[20:34:56] <Gazpacho> does the li exist at the time the click action is added?
[20:36:09] <otiuk> when the li is added to the sortable list it contains a link with the class
[20:36:26] <otiuk> and then i have a .click action that is set to remove() the closest li
[20:37:10] <otiuk> $('#sortable').append('<li id="'+ele_id+'" class="l_box yellow">(<a href="javascript://" class="removeItem">X</a>) blah</li>');
[20:37:11] <Gazpacho> event handlers attach to elements that have classes, not to classes. have you read the section of the jquery.on documentation about direct and delgated events?
[20:38:30] <otiuk> $("#sortable .removeElement").click(function() { $(this).closest('li').remove(); });
[20:38:45] <Gazpacho> short answer: set a handler on the ul that handles events to the li's inside it
[20:39:18] <Gazpacho> that way you can add more li's and still get the event
[20:40:08] <otiuk> do you have a good resource I could read about it (or the longer answer) i'm fairly new to jquery
[20:40:19] <Gazpacho> i already did
[22:16:23] <CapMax> is there any easy way to get the date range of this week/month, etc
[22:24:26] <murachan> does jquery changes the browser compatible mode
[22:34:40] <Cork> murachan: no, not jquery it self
[22:38:56] <Cork> ?eval var a= new Date(); var range = []; a.setDate(a.getDate() - a.getDay() + 1); range.push(a.getDate()); a.setDate(a.getDate() + 7); range.push(a.getDate()); range @ CapMax
[22:38:59] <bot-t> CapMax: [10, 17]
[22:39:48] <CapMax> thanks
[22:40:25] <Cork> and just to make it clear
[22:40:33] <Cork> ?eval var a= new Date('2013-05-02'); var range = []; a.setDate(a.getDate() - a.getDay() + 1); range.push(a.getDate()); a.setDate(a.getDate() + 7); range.push(a.getDate()); range
[22:40:34] <bot-t> Cork: [29, 6]
[22:41:05] <Cork> it works cross month/year boundaries

[23:17:07] <lamerion> or is there a way to tell jquery mobile not to mess with the page DOM
[23:24:19] <lemonsparrow> hi i have a 160 line DOM that I need to build using jQuery... should I use $.append for it or is there a better way to build the DOM using jQuery ?
[23:25:56] <systemfault> lol
[23:26:03] <systemfault> Same timeâ€¦ same question.
[23:35:46] <Anticom> good morning all together :)
[23:36:54] <Cork> lamerion: why don't you just use basic jquery instead?
[23:37:41] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the solution that gives the best performance is to generate an html string and then append that
[23:38:00] <Anticom> I'm developing some kind of editor assisting users to insert tokens into text. Now i've run into two issues: 1st: The toolbar is placed above the textarea it is attatched to and fades in, when the textarea is hovered. usually it should fade out as soon as as the focus is lost on the textarea. but now if you want to move over the toolbar it fades out. How do i solve that? timeout maybe? 2nd I just don't get the
[23:38:00] <Anticom>  button and combobox aligned vertically properly
[23:38:06] <Anticom> here's a working example: http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/
[23:38:12] <Anticom> Monring Cork :)
[23:38:15] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and if you want to generate dom elements, make sure you don't add them one at a time to a parent element that is in the document
[23:38:24] <Cork> lemonsparrow: cause that will KILL performance
[23:38:24] <lemonsparrow> Cork: u mean to say put the entire dom as a string ?
[23:38:46] <Cork> lemonsparrow: no if you have it as dom just append them in one go
[23:38:56] <Cork> if you generate it, generate it as a string from the start
[23:39:07] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hmmm.... pretty tough
[23:39:37] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well generate the dom elements and then append them
[23:40:19] <Cork> just make sure you don't do something like <loop> var elm = $('<elm/>');...; $('body').append(elm); </next loop>
[23:40:43] <Cork> cause that will trigger a reflow on each iteration of the loop; and it will totally eat your performance
[23:41:51] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can u show me in this sample example.. ur preferred best appoach? http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/mTup5/
[23:42:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: also someone suggested me handlebar.js is it good ?
[23:42:13] <Cork> never used it
[23:42:17] <Cork> so cant tell
[23:42:45] <Cork> i'm not even sure what that is meant to do
[23:43:02] <Cork> all i get is an list with Apple and Mango
[23:43:21] <Anticom> :D
[23:43:42] <Anticom> i think it's supposed to be a ui-tabs
[23:44:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: that is html right
[23:44:45] <Anticom> oh is it :O
[23:44:46] <Cork> ya?
[23:45:00] <Cork> not really sure how it relates to the question you asked
[23:45:03] <lamerion> @Cork hmm i don't really get it, basic jquery to style the forms? I choose jQuery mobile to style stuff so that it looks standard in mobile and main site though since it speed things up in development by styling the elements onload
[23:45:29] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the thing I need to do is as simple as this.. currently I have a jsp in which DOM is hardcoded... I need to remove it from the jsp.. have a js file being called in it which will generate this DOM for me.. using jQeruy
[23:45:44] <Cork> Anticom: i would prob bind a blur on the textarea and then check if the new target is the toolbar and if it isn't do the fadeout
[23:45:55] <Anticom> lamerion is the fiddle equivalent to what your real site looks like? if not you should get it to work the same way ur site does because otherwise we can't do anything with it
[23:46:17] <Cork> lamerion: then user the css from jqm, but not the lib
[23:46:27] <Cork> all the styling is just classes anyway
[23:46:36] <Anticom> Cork thought about something similar but honnestly i just don't know how to check the "next target"
[23:46:50] <Cork> lemonsparrow: jsp is server side; you don't have dom there
[23:47:50] <Anticom> lemonsparrow $('body').html('<div>hello world!</div>'); ?
[23:47:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: this is what I have inside jsp http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/mTup5/3/
[23:48:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: now I need to remove that completely and build it again using jQuery
[23:48:38] <Cork> lemonsparrow: why don't you just send the new html section from the server and then just append it?
[23:48:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can't do that
[23:49:02] <Cork> why not?
[23:49:08] <Anticom> Cork also i'm not using focus event to fade in the toolbar but hover or better to say mouseenter
[23:49:31] <Anticom> Cork how do i detect, wether a mouse is over a certain element (and it's childs!) ?
[23:49:32] <Cork> Anticom: then just wrap it all in a div and make the mouseenter on that
[23:49:44] <Cork> mouseenter is exactly for that
[23:49:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: in many areas we have used $.append so probably want to stick to the same pattern of building DOM from front that getting it send through server
[23:49:51] <lemonsparrow> http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/mTup5/3/ Cork
[23:49:52] <lamerion> pretty sure the elements are not just truely css based though
[23:50:24] <Cork> lemonsparrow: your leaving a BIG gap in the middle of your reasoning
[23:50:27] <Anticom> Cork that would move down the textarea and leave a gap on the top when the toolbar is hidden, doesn't it? and i don't want that
[23:51:00] <Cork> you have a static html page, and you want to use $.append; fine (1 and 2); 4. you have to generate dom ?!? why?
[23:51:40] <Cork> lemonsparrow: what is it with the new content that prevents the server from sending it?
[23:52:12] <Cork> Anticom: no
[23:52:20] <Anticom> no? :O
[23:52:29] <Anticom> let me try^^
[23:52:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: noting as such but...
[23:56:07] <lemonsparrow> Cork: need help on how to build it now using $.append or some other better way as far as ur question's answer is concerned.. we are doing this way since the client wants it this way :(
[23:58:16] <Anticom> dafuq
[23:58:42] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/869Xj/1/ now the stuff gets executed twice
[23:58:50] <Anticom> the dom is totally messed up now
[23:59:02] <Cork> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/2PARQ/
[23:59:14] <Cork> opps i broke it >_<
[23:59:19] <Cork> one sec let me fix it again...
