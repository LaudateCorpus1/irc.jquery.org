[00:08:44] <silv3r_m00n> hi there i am using jquery ui dialog box 1.10.4 and the problem is that if the page's vertical scroller is somewhere in the middle, dragging the dialog pushes it away from the mouse pointer
[00:08:49] <silv3r_m00n> how to fix this ?
[00:11:27] <silv3r_m00n> this happens in google chrome
[00:12:40] <silv3r_m00n> what is this, http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3568
[00:27:48] <hackal> Hello, here I have a logic to check last letter of input. http://jsfiddle.net/LVe5Z/ When its true I need to remove/prevent last letter from input. How could I do it?
[01:01:56] <MACscr> hmm, not really sure why this isnt loading the spinner first and then loading the 'test content' http://jsfiddle.net/t9XgP/
[01:02:03] <MACscr> does it immediately
[01:05:40] <MACscr> nvm, figured it out
[01:23:33] <masscrx> hi
[01:23:50] <masscrx> I want to resolve some information about this code http://pastebin.com/eyHEVhKj
[01:24:03] <masscrx> this -> function(evt, data, status, xhr)
[01:24:28] <masscrx> what should I look for in google to read about this statement?
[01:47:29] <ussher_> "xhr response" is probably a good place to start.
[01:47:52] <ussher_> masscrx:
[01:51:57] <masscrx> I've found almost all information, now I;m trying to check xhr response type
[01:53:19] <masscrx> in jquery docs is written that I can setp dataType before send request to server
[01:53:32] <masscrx> but how to get ajax response type hmm
[02:57:39] <Kirito> Only IE prohibits changing an input fields type, right?
[03:00:33] <Kirito> http://diveintohtml5.info/detect.html#input-types And according to this, if I were to use jQuery to change a text input field to color, if the browser didn't support the color input field, it would refuse to do so, yes?
[03:36:34] <Azrael_-> hi
[03:36:43] <Azrael_-> i've got a table  with groups. for each group i've got a header which uses all columns. is there a sorting-plugin which can still sort it but preserve the groups?
[04:16:42] <masscrx> i have problem with parsing json data
[04:16:48] <masscrx> this is my data: {"8":"Not enough items"}
[04:16:56] <masscrx> and after data = $.parseJSON(data); in jquery script I have error: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 2 of the JSON data
[04:21:43] <decx> put quotes around it
[04:22:32] <decx> data = {"8":"Not enough items"} is just an object. if you actually want to use parseJSON it needs to be '{"8":"Not enough items"}'
[04:23:00] <decx> then again i dont know why you would use parsejson if you already have the data
[05:06:13] <wenber> hi
[05:07:15] <wenber> this is the first time when i use this tool to chat with you!
[05:10:45] <systemfault> :)
[05:19:38] <dave_2> hello need a little help
[05:22:34] <wenber> is anyone there?
[05:32:59] <d> haha
[06:43:49] <hurram> Can someone spot why does this result in http 500? I'm probably missing something stupid...

[06:54:21] <rahuldroy> Hi Guys, I am getting a error, can someone tell me where i am going wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/LXvTC/
[07:12:13] <gnu_d> Hi, is it possible somehow to have parallel download and upload via AJAX ? This is my pseudo code: http://jsfiddle.net/7reAH/
[07:12:14] <sacho_> what's up with those label tags
[07:12:56] <sacho_> and those slashes
[07:12:57] <rahuldroy> sacho_: I wrote them just for demo and for
[07:13:16] <sacho_> the reason why you get the syntax error is because you're missing quotes around your string
[07:14:36] <sacho_> gnu_d, no, that's not how http works
[07:14:47] <sacho_> you can't "pause" a request
[07:14:52] <sacho_> you either send it or you don't
[07:15:24] <gnu_d> sacho_: I know, but how do I proxy the download between a localhost and a server ?
[07:15:45] <gnu_d> sacho_: knowing the the file can have size like 1gb
[07:16:01] <sacho_> well, you can send chunks to the server, which it builds up until you tell it you're done
[07:16:22] <gnu_d> sacho_: the localserver only gives me whole file to download
[07:16:58] <rahuldroy> sacho_: my element name has [] (just how zend framework does it). Jquery documentation says that you need a \\ before each meta character. I am really have no idea how to handle this in jQuery
[07:19:21] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: You can do $('foo[name="something[]"]') to avoid the escaping.
[07:19:41] <BillCriswell> or even $('input').filter(function(){ return this.name === 'something[]'; });
[07:20:34] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: I am getting the element names from a for loop $("input:checked").each(function () { elemName = $(this).attr('name'); ....
[07:21:11] <gnu_d> sacho_: if I don't use xmlhttprequest for the upload, can I at least get the data as chunks while it's being downloaded in the xmlhttprequest?
[07:21:15] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: Not sure how one is related to the other.
[07:21:30] <BillCriswell> Do you want all the checked ones with a particular name?
[07:21:55] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: all of them. The demo only shows one as an example
[07:22:44] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: I'm confused.
[07:23:39] <sacho_> gnu_d, you could use the onprogress events
[07:24:17] <gnu_d> sacho_: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/progress/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#progressevent this one ?
[07:24:58] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/LXvTC/1/
[07:26:15] <sacho_> sure
[07:28:06] <gnu_d> sacho_: and which is the current data parameter ?
[07:28:57] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: You're overcomplicating this. Just do checkboxes = $('input').filter(function(){ return this.name === elemName; });
[07:29:52] <BillCriswell> Remove the second elemName line.
[07:29:56] <BillCriswell> No need to replace like that.
[07:30:22] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/LXvTC/5/
[07:30:33] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: Let me try your suggestion quickly
[07:31:18] <BillCriswell> Also make sure your HTML is valid.
[07:31:33] <BillCriswell> I see some missing " that'll ruin days.
[07:39:21] <rahuldroy> I just checked the html using the validator at it is valid. just warnings about using HTML5. your solution is still generating the same error because jQuery requires us to have '\\' for meta-characters in selecters
[07:47:47] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: In the string yet.
[07:47:49] <BillCriswell> yes*
[07:48:00] <BillCriswell> In the selector, yes. Not in the filter.
[07:49:25] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: I am struggling to understand it. Can you please update this code for me - http://jsfiddle.net/LXvTC/5/
[07:51:31] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: http://jsbin.com/fofotejo/2/edit?html,js
[07:51:59] <BillCriswell> Three different ways to do it.
[08:00:17] <decx> i'd add a couple more \
[08:04:19] <BillCriswell> decx: Never have enough \.
[08:04:25] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: loved how you named the third variable. made me giggle
[08:04:56] <BillCriswell> When I see that I want to cry usually.
[08:05:20] <BillCriswell> I guess there's some valid reason for someone wanting to do it that way. I can't think of one right now, though.
[08:09:24] <decx> it's another extended weekend
[08:09:37] <decx> although i dont know what pfingsten actually is
[08:10:11] <shout_user> here's a new tiny plugin i just hacked together: http://erming.github.io/jquery-string_to_color/ it turns strings into hex colors
[08:14:51] <BillCriswell> erming: Good times haha
[08:15:01] <BillCriswell> I'm glad my name as a color turned out attractive.
[08:16:09] <decx> you gotta change your algorithm i'm not lime
[08:20:28] <erming> mine's a pretty boring dark blue :(
[08:26:31] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: I had to stay that way because I need to get the index of the selected element. That index is used to get the value from an array.
[08:26:57] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: That's not making sense.
[08:30:05] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/BjthT069 This is what I am trying to do
[08:30:45] <BillCriswell> You do not need to escape here.
[08:31:51] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: turns out the selector was fine
[08:32:16] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: I just got super confused and started to blame escape
[08:33:14] <rahuldroy> just a simple check for checkboxes and then added a + "[]" fixed it for me
[08:46:21] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: Awesome.
[08:46:29] <BillCriswell> Have to run. Take care!
[08:46:58] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell: thanks for all your help aye. I really really appreciate it :)
[09:35:15] <arxwn> Hello, I use this to get the text for a span in a table cell: $('table#tableID tbody.someClass tr#rowID td.cellCLass span').text();
[09:35:36] <arxwn> Is this slower than using find() ?
[09:42:55] <systemfault> arxwn: Same… but if you have 2 ids in a selector, you’re doing something wrong.
[09:43:33] <arxwn> That selector works fine because ids are in unigue elements
[09:43:44] <arxwn> but is it advisable to use it like this?
[09:44:39] <Jattenalle> arxwn, as long as you store the result of the select if you're doing a lot of operations on the same thing
[09:44:43] * Jattenalle shrugs
[09:44:47] <Jattenalle> i doubt it matters enough
[09:44:53] <systemfault> Unless your HTML is invalid, $('#rowID .cellCLass span').text(); should do the same
[09:45:20] <Jattenalle> systemfault, wont that early table cull down the tree it's searching though?
[09:46:06] <arxwn> $('#rowID .cellCLass span').text(); VS $('tr#rowID td.cellCLass span').text();  ??????????? Or it does not make any matter?
[09:47:10] <systemfault> Jattenalle: It depends on on the implementation of the browser’s QSA and Sizzle. Browsers have optimized lookups for ids
[09:47:19] <Jattenalle> ah
[09:48:59] <arxwn> What if $('#rowID ).find('.cellCLass span').text(); ??? will it be quicker because of sizzle?
[09:50:11] <systemfault> arxwn: At this point, just try it and see on different browsers.
[09:50:33] <systemfault> Also, I’d be surprised if this is the bottleneck of your application.
[09:50:35] <arxwn> I ll try it at jsperf
[09:50:40] <systemfault> cool :)
[10:03:37] <saucey> hey guys
[10:12:10] <arxwn> I think you should see the results: http://jsperf.com/jquery-various-selectors-vs-find-in-table
[10:13:22] <arxwn> The wiiners are the selectors with tag names
[10:13:36] <arxwn> interesting
[10:14:23] <arxwn> jquery find() is a looser
[10:14:23] <systemfault> Personally… I see that they all have the same result except for 2 which are really slow.
[10:15:36] <arxwn> damn
[10:15:48] <arxwn> In firefox the results are totsally diferrent
[10:15:52] <arxwn> what the fuck
[10:16:34] <systemfault> arxwn: Like I told you… it’s depends on the browser/QSA/Sizzle
[10:17:14] <systemfault> arxwn: But seriously, that’s a synthetic benchmark… you will never do something like jsperf does in practice..
[10:17:43] <systemfault> Like getting the text of a span in a loop without caching the selector into a variable.
[10:17:52] <arxwn> Can someone test it using IE?
[10:18:00] <arxwn> yes you are probably right
[10:18:04] <systemfault> I don’t have it here :/
[10:18:34] <arxwn> thats ok
[10:19:44] <arxwn> Thats an example what I did so to know better how to write the code, for example to use or not the tag names before id or class
[10:20:55] <systemfault> arxwn: Using the simplest selectors possible and “real css selectors(not the fake sizzle ones)” is usually the way to go
[10:21:30] <arxwn> the simplest and short ones, am I right?  eh?
[10:21:50] <systemfault> Yeah…
[10:21:57] <arxwn> OK
[10:21:59] <arxwn> thnax
[10:22:02] <arxwn> thanx
[10:38:09] <ggherdov> Hello. I am reading code from a js project that uses jquery. In there I find "$document" and "$(document)". Are they the same thing?

[11:34:08] <doug65536m> How can I see debugger output during page load? about:debug debugger console is closed during page load where the error occurs
[11:34:38] <sunbeam> how is the support for main tag in HTML5?
[11:34:43] <sunbeam> i mean the browsers
[11:35:11] <doug65536m> Check caniuse
[11:36:31] <doug65536m> http://caniuse.com
[11:36:58] <sunbeam> Strange
[11:37:05] <sunbeam> It says on most browsers
[11:37:07] <sunbeam> however i cannot style it
[11:40:25] <jaspertheghost> 73.49.186.47:8888/enter_data.html  checkbox labels at the bottom are breaking to the next line can someone explain why/how to fix?
[11:43:12] <erming> jaspertheghost: .ui-checkbox has position: absolute on it
[11:43:49] <erming> turn that off, and fix some of the css and you're good to go
[11:43:53] <jaspertheghost> where do u see that?
[11:44:11] <paulvd> .ui-checkbox, .ui-radio has position: relative here to me
[11:44:33] <doug65536m> sunbeam it works for http://jsfiddle.net/55j9x/
[11:44:34] <paulvd> jaspertheghost: are you referring to mustache, beard?
[11:44:44] <jaspertheghost> yes
[11:44:46] <doug65536m> Me*
[11:44:59] <paulvd> the input is wrapped in a div
[11:45:01] <paulvd> thats why
[11:45:04] <paulvd> jaspertheghost ^^
[11:45:52] <jaspertheghost> i dont’t follow… i mean i have a few divs in there that wrap some parent elements
[11:46:16] <jaspertheghost> its imidiate parent isnt a div though
[11:47:39] <paulvd> <div class=" ui-checkbox"><input type="checkbox" name="descmustache" data-cacheval="false"></div> << you have this
[11:47:53] <jaspertheghost> its jqeury fucking with it then
[11:48:01] <paulvd> lol?
[11:52:17] <jaspertheghost> thank you
[11:56:32] <djam90> Is there any recommend way of handling responses from an ajax request to PHP? I know jQuery has .done and .fail, but I feel this doesn't account for custom messages. So when returning (echoing) something from my PHP script, what do I send back? An object with a message of success or fail with a custom fail message? or what? How do you guys handle it for ajax?
[11:57:14] <brunoais> djam90, the success and fail callbacks are related to the status code alone. There's nothing else to it
[11:57:21] <djam90> ah I see
[11:57:29] <brunoais> the .done() callback is called always, btw
[11:58:14] <djam90> brunoais, so is there a best practice or recommended way of handling responses from PHP script (and also, what to send back from PHP?)
[11:58:27] <brunoais> not really
[11:58:44] <djam90> I see
[11:58:55] <brunoais> use the one you are msot confortable with
[11:59:09] <djam90> brunoais, well, I currently don't use one
[11:59:13] <djam90> I just echo any data back
[11:59:24] <djam90> but I don't account for failure
[11:59:24] <brunoais> use any data structure you prefer
[11:59:32] <djam90> okay
[11:59:38] <jaspertheghost> that bring me to my next question how do i remove jquery styleing for 1 thing?
[11:59:46] <brunoais> there are some "standard" ones that ppl use though
[12:00:01] <brunoais> djam90, for example, using JSON with a status response for the request
[12:00:17] <brunoais> jaspertheghost, jQuery does not do styling
[12:00:19] <brunoais> what do you mean?
[12:00:23] <jaspertheghost> jqeury mobile sorry
[12:00:33] <brunoais> then I cannot help you
[12:00:38] <brunoais> I only use CSS for styling
[12:00:42] <djam90> so echo an object with status-response?
[12:00:44] <brunoais> *stiling
[12:00:53] <brunoais> djam90, JSON
[12:01:05] <jaspertheghost> data-role="none"   might work
[12:01:19] <djam90> in PHP I just echo json_encode(response)
[12:01:33] <jaspertheghost> i love being able to do that in php so easly :)
[12:02:07] <brunoais> djam90, depending on what you want, that may be the best choice
[12:02:20] <djam90> cool
[12:07:41] <sunbeam> does anyone know how I Can add the 2x greater than icon in :after{} ?

But it seems this code enters into an infinite bucle. How can I fix it or even change the code to run better?
[12:30:39] <sunbeam> as alternative technique to icon sprites, what can I use ?
[13:06:25] <cam_y> how do I say if not IE 8 ? this doesn't work - <!--[if !IE 8 ]>
[13:28:40] <jaspertheghost> anyone else get the problemn where ur page doesnt finish loading just says read.jqeury.com or whatever at the bottom in status...
[13:34:24] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost: No.
[13:34:55] <jaspertheghost> dang
[13:35:25] <jaspertheghost> cant tell if its my internet connection (says all the shit loaded i think dont know why it just spins (saying loading)
[13:35:45] <BillCriswell> That link redirects in a bunch of weird ways.
[13:36:15] <BillCriswell> Might have something fishy going on with your computer.

[13:37:20] <sunbeam> as alternative technique to icon sprites, what can I use ?
[13:37:29] <jaspertheghost> does that page finish loading for you?
[13:44:04] <BillCriswell> No.
[13:44:14] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: SVG? Font icons?
[13:44:24] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: which would you recommend for me ?
[13:44:35] <sunbeam> not much bytes per icon
[13:46:30] <BillCriswell> I find myself using sprites mostly.
[13:47:11] <BillCriswell> For development I like fonts though because I can change sizes and colors easily.
[13:47:44] <BillCriswell> SVG is great, but it's IE9+
[13:48:06] <jenia> hello everyone.
[13:48:16] <jenia> i;m loading a page dynamically.
[13:48:25] <jenia> i'm using jqueyr mobile btw
[13:48:32] <jenia> how do I register an event with that page?
[13:48:34] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: how does SVG work?
[13:49:01] <jenia> I want to do $("dialog.html).on(function(){console.log("hello world")});
[13:49:21] <jenia> I want to do $("dialog.html).on("pageinit", function(){console.log("hello world")});
[13:49:43] <BillCriswell> It's like an XML file basically.
[13:50:28] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://icomoon.io/app/#/select this is a great resource. You can export a font or svg to create minimal files.
[13:51:03] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: from where can i best import icons?
[13:51:09] <sunbeam> i mean which way
[13:51:29] <sunbeam> and yes, this looks like a great resource :)
[13:51:50] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Depending on how the graphics were made you would export it from photoshop
[13:51:52] <BillCriswell> or AI
[13:51:59] <BillCriswell> or whatever design people use these days.
[13:53:09] <sunbeam> i have them in .png
[13:53:11] <sunbeam> but thats not good i guess
[13:53:40] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: It's not bad by any means.
[13:54:27] <BillCriswell> Nothing wrong with some propertly compressed pngs. Get them all into a sprite and it's even better since it's fewer http requests.
[13:55:07] <BillCriswell> If you use compass I think that will build the sprite sheets and CSS for you
[13:56:22] <BillCriswell> http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/spriting/
[14:00:31] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: the problem is i cannot use sprites for this project
[14:01:09] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Whatever you want to do.
[14:01:52] <tw2113> i can't think of a single situation where sprites wouldn't be an option
[14:02:32] <BillCriswell> I don't ask questions anymore lol
[14:02:44] <tw2113> i didn't ask a question either
[14:02:47] <tw2113> :D
[14:06:27] <harikb> Hello, I am trying to under code pattern such as this http://jsfiddle.net/RX3Na/1/  - I have read through what appeared as defer/promise documentation, but I am still confused the exact code that runs when the promise object is made vs when it is resolved
[14:07:28] <harikb> s/under/understand/
[14:19:26] <shoky> harikb in this case since there is nothing asynchronous going on, there's not much of a point to using promises/deferreds
[14:20:07] <harikb> shoky: thanks that was my next question. No async since resolve() is called immediate and not on a potential .done() call from localstorage. Right?
[14:21:07] <shoky> harikb: if localStorage.setItem was an async operation that takes a callback as argument (like ajax requests do, or setTimeout), then it'd make sense, yeah
[14:24:35] <harikb> Is this common for js code to use the promise / defer with these hooks to allow/force the caller to use .done() ? May be that author is leaving room to make it async in future?
[14:25:29] <shoky> could be. but i would bet that the more common case is people not fully knowing what they're doing ;)
[14:25:57] <shoky> if you're still talking about using promises for non-async stuff, that is
[14:27:20] <harikb> shoky: yes, I was talking about non-async stuff wrapped using a defer/promise setup and expecting the caller to use .done() when there is no async code path going on
[14:27:34] <harikb> shoky: thanks for your quick help, I appreciate it
[14:27:46] <shoky> no probs

[15:20:12] <Wolfed> Howdy, I am having some issues appending text to dynamically generated markup. I am doing an ajax request which is placed inside #main, but appending text to a selector inside #main doesnt seem to work.
[15:20:36] <DansVC> hi :D
[15:20:48] <Wolfed> Tried with $('#main').find('#selector').append('Test'); and $('#selector').append('Test'); neither one works
[15:21:14] <Wolfed> Any possible suggestions? (I'll make a fiddle in the meantime :P)
[15:21:47] <DansVC> what are you trying to do?
[15:27:29] <Wolfed> Ok, it goes something like this http://jsfiddle.net/EkGW4/
[15:27:57] <Wolfed> When switching one of the select groups I wanna append text into the latest <td> (#td-bet[0]) but it wont work :<

[15:55:38] <Mushr00m> Hi !
[15:56:41] <Mushr00m> I've a collection of elements doing this var $names = $container.find('.names a'); later I need to get from my collection $names the one that has the class "active" how should I it ?
[15:57:10] <shoky> .filter('.active')
[15:58:27] <Mushr00m> Filter it the equibalent of Find() but one the same level and not childs ?
[15:58:47] <shoky> that's one way of putting it.. yeah
[15:59:05] <shoky> it just filters the original collection
[15:59:34] <shoky> find looks at descendants, recursively
[15:59:45] <Mushr00m> Ok i understand
[16:00:14] <Mushr00m> Looking at the doc it's the only way to search in my collection to find a specific element
[16:01:53] <Mushr00m> thanks for the quick help

[17:03:48] <damasceno> Does anyone have only the loading Jquery css part of the code? When I use the entire file (jquery-mobile.css) it causes a conflict between this file and another one.
[17:10:50] <aFeijo> hi folks, I have a problem in a client site where we use the jquery liquid slider plugin, when you hit the right key in the keyboard, it slide half way to the right, not fully. I try a few ideas of mine without sucess... I hope someone might have a suggestion? http://www.immortal.com.sg/#work
[17:13:17] <tandroid> aFeijo, that site really freaks out when you scroll...
[17:13:30] <tandroid> I'm using a trackpad on a mac though so maybe it doesn't always do that.
[17:13:45] <aFeijo> tandroid, dont tell me!!!! I helped my contact with this freakazoid site, glad I didnt had to do much
[17:14:07] <aFeijo> the client was very specific with all that scrolling everywhere... ouch
[17:14:21] <aFeijo> he thought it was modern, futuristic, haha
[17:15:24] <tandroid> Maybe modern in the sense that it probably wouldn't work at all on any older computer or browser haha
[17:15:29] <aFeijo> it seems that liquid slider dont notice its 2 pages
[17:15:46] <aFeijo> it divide, but add only 1 dot for page 1, page 2 is missing
[17:15:57] <aFeijo> stupid bug ... :/
[17:16:46] <tandroid> I can't do anything without blowing up the site haha
[17:16:55] <aFeijo> welcome to my world
[17:17:15] <tandroid> I would start over
[17:17:20] <tandroid> With the whole site.
[17:17:26] <aFeijo> no time nor budget heh
[17:18:00] <tandroid> Show the client analytics
[17:18:11] <aFeijo> I dont have it
[17:18:44] <tandroid> Now's a good time to start it!
[17:19:26] <aFeijo> that site has the analytics tracking, they have access to the reports, I dont ... but they probably dont know how to read it lol
[17:20:11] <tandroid> Ohhh haha
[17:44:45] <damasceno> Does anyone know how to use a simple Jquery Mobile Loader? I tried using the examples here: http://api.jquerymobile.com/loader/#method-show but it's not working...
[17:49:33] <tandroid> Did you load jquery first?
[17:49:49] <tandroid> and jquery mobile?
[18:06:20] <jenia> hello
[18:07:09] <jenia> what would it mean for a company if people signed in into the application using facebook or google?
[18:09:03] <jrockjiggz> Why is there jQuery 2.0 and 1.1 ? what ever happened to jquery 1.9?
[18:11:43] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: There was a jQuery 1.9… then 1.10… and 1.11
[18:11:58] <systemfault> We’re now at 1.11
[18:12:11] <systemfault> 1.11.1 to be exact.
[18:13:30] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: But… 1.11.1 and 2.1.1 have the same features, the 2.x series drop old IE support…. so depending if you need to support old IE, you’re going to pick either 1.11.1 or 2.1.1
[18:13:41] <jenia> how do you solve the problem of login on mobile devices?
[18:13:42] <jrockjiggz> systemfault: thanks, i wondered why, why the split
[18:13:50] <jrockjiggz> ohk
[18:14:02] <jrockjiggz> cool :)
[18:14:48] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: The development of 1.x and 2.x are “sync’ed” so when 2.2 will be released, a 1.12 will also be released.
[18:17:28] <jrockjiggz> The version sequence is misleading..
[18:17:47] <jrockjiggz> why not 1.9.12
[18:18:07] <jaspertheghost> also 73.49.186.47:8888/amortization/index_test.php  i cant get the table width’s to adjust i know css should be used and not table’s but i inherited the code and converting this to css would take me about 2 hours    its prolly something stupid simple if anyone can take a look
[18:18:24] <jaspertheghost> and i know its the wrong channel but no ones talking in the right channels
[18:24:06] <jrockjiggz> jaspertheghost: set both <table>'s width="1000" to width="100%"
[18:24:12] <jenia> how does one go about authentication users in a mobile app?
[18:24:48] <jenia> i mean, should i create my own authentication subprogram or how do you proceed?
[18:29:06] <jaspertheghost> jrock i did thatg but when i goto adjust the width still not working.. im not even sure where the width of these is coming from … i inherited this code...
[18:29:26] <jrockjiggz> <table width="1000">
[18:33:36] <jaspertheghost> got it thanks!
[18:37:12] <jaspertheghost> what if i wantit smaller than 100% though?
[18:40:31] <jaspertheghost> specially where it says Records: and then breaks i want it to continue
[18:41:22] <jaspertheghost> screw it the guy shoulda used css
