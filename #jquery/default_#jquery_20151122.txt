[03:09:51] <Mark____> where can i get this kind of fade in and zoom in effect for texts? im sure there’s a jquery plugin for that http://www.undsgn.com/uncode/home/blog-metro/ anybody?
[03:23:39] <Patero-ng> hi I downloaded a jquery lightbox and I did everything put the new tag on head and footers and copied the css file and javascripts files; all but the initialization code I don't know how to make the images be zoomed, I don't understand the http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html documentation fully
[03:52:49] <Mark____> anyone give me a hand on scrollme.js?
[05:00:35] <Mark____> does anyone know why this js plugin won’t apply to my website? http://soulwire.github.io/FoldScroll/
[06:06:53] <Mark____> anyone alive?
[07:07:16] <Patero-ng> I have a question, I want part of a text link not to display text decoration or it's value set to none, so only part of the text link is underlined... is it possible? I tried and can't do it
[07:24:37] <Uhkis> Patero-ng: use span for that part

[10:26:06] <PCatinean> when doing $.fn.digits = function(){
[10:26:17] <PCatinean> why I cannot use it on strings?
[10:30:21] <shoky> because $.fn is the prototype for jQuery objects, not for strings
[10:59:10] <wili> Hey, anyone have experience with https://github.com/codedance/jquery.AreYouSure I have problem. if I am using form="article_form" in form elements outside of form tag areyousure poping dialog also during pressing submit button.
[11:06:37] <xgFx> Hello, i append li items to ul and afterwards i want that li elements to scroll. but somehow i cant manipulate those li.
[11:06:58] <xgFx> i think thats something basic but u dont know what to google for
[11:07:05] <xgFx> can someone give me a hint
[11:07:13] <derstrom> xgFx: We can't help you without seeing your code
[11:07:17] <derstrom> Please paste it on jsfiddle.net
[11:07:21] <xgFx> ah ok. one moment
[11:16:10] <xgFx> hmm, not a good exmaple because with jsfiddle it works
[11:16:11] <xgFx> http://jsfiddle.net/xzfgxug7/
[11:18:02] <xgFx> but inside the dokuwiki template it wont... i thought it has something to do with the fact that i load html in the DOM and than try to manipulate it (vticker)
[11:18:44] <xgFx> it is inside the dom. inside the ul but wont scroll by
[11:21:04] <derstrom> I would have also thought the problem here is the dynamically-appended element. I would be surprised if ln. 6 works for the dynamically appended HTML element too.
[11:22:06] <xgFx> how is this problem of the dynamically appended called ? i would like to google it and read about it...
[11:23:38] <derstrom> Something like "Manipulating dynamically added element jQuery", but interestingly, replacing ln. 6 with the following outputs the dynamically-added HTML in the dev tools: "console.log(jQuery('li:last-child').html());"
[11:25:20] <derstrom> I assume the problem here is vTicker does not cycle through the last li you've appended?
[11:27:30] <xgFx> hmm, i dont know. i'm really new to jquery and js. i will try to understand vTicker and look into it. if i dont find the answer i will ask again. Thank you so far
[11:28:45] <derstrom> https://jsfiddle.net/xzfgxug7/1/ this is the problem you have?
[11:30:23] <xgFx> nope. it just doesnt show up. but i guess it has also something to do with the doku wiki itself. because in jsfiddler it works.
[11:30:50] <xgFx> sorry my english isnt that good...
[11:30:58] <xgFx> i hope you know what i mean
[11:31:36] <derstrom> Yes, here it is working: https://jsfiddle.net/xzfgxug7/2/
[11:33:06] <derstrom> It didn't work because id="vticker" was assigned to <ul> and not to a parent <div>
[11:33:19] <derstrom> I assume the library looks for the <ul> and cycles through each <li>
[11:33:48] <xgFx> thank you. i'll try that.´
[11:41:28] <derstrom> xgFx: actually your original code also works fine when I include the vTicker library correctly on the jsfiddle page. OK so I suspect the problem you had was your append code wasn't wrapped in the ready() function, so the vTicker was firing without your appended HTML
[11:42:22] <derstrom> xgFx: I would recommend you read about: https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[11:43:27] <xgFx> thank you. i assume you are german? because of your name? Can i send you pm?
[11:43:58] <jak2000> hi all, anyone give me a hand, http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/f5v47r3c/1/   in line 40 i change the date, and after show the form, but was displayed with actual date, how to store the calendar with the date of line 40?  thanks
[11:46:22] <xgFx> the code is inside the document ready function. but i will read it anyway. it cant hurt :)
[11:47:25] <derstrom> xgFx: nope sorry, I only know very very basic German - I do hope to learn German one day though. (Yes my username is German, you're the first person to catch that!)
[11:47:46] <derstrom> I lived in Germany for a number of years, which is why I am interested in re-learning the language.
[11:47:59] <derstrom> You're English is far better than my German, put it that way.
[11:48:28] <Foxhoundz> jak2000: it shows it correctly
[11:48:55] <Foxhoundz> you put 2015/06/19 and it shows it as 201506/19 when show form is clicked. Is this not what you wanted?
[11:49:21] <jak2000> not
[11:49:28] <jak2000> in the calendar wich date is displayed?
[11:50:13] <Foxhoundz> ohhh
[11:50:15] <Foxhoundz> I see :)
[11:50:49] <jak2000> i want fix this
[11:51:12] <Foxhoundz> jak2000: on line 40, instead of calling .val() call .datepicker()
[11:51:25] <jak2000> Foxhoundz i found....
[11:51:27] <jak2000> the solution:
[11:51:28] <derstrom> xgFx: you might want to check your developer tools to see if any errors are output with your original code before replacing it with the code I have provided
[11:51:29] <Foxhoundz> as in $('#fetcha_start').datepicker('setDate', new Date...)
[11:51:37] <Foxhoundz> ok good
[11:51:38] <jak2000> line 40: $("#fecha_start").val("06/19/2015");
[11:51:43] <jak2000> not like me much
[11:51:55] <jak2000> Foxhoundz give me your solution pls
[11:52:01] <Foxhoundz> I just did ^
[11:52:12] <jak2000> new Date... ?
[11:52:22] <Foxhoundz> pass it a new date object with the desired date
[11:53:06] <Foxhoundz> or a string date
[11:53:21] <xgFx> derstrom: If i can learn jQuery you can learn german... "Übung macht den Meister" :)
[11:53:28] <Foxhoundz> $('#fetcha_start').datepicker('setDate', '12/21/1957')
[11:53:38] <derstrom> xgFx: hehe, true
[11:54:46] <derstrom> xgFx: One day it will become a reality. I'm certainly not giving up. Anyway, you are welcome to PM me if you have any problems with your jquery, but the code provided should work fine :)
[11:55:15] <jak2000> Foxhoundz: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/f5v47r3c/2/
[11:55:19] <jak2000> not work for me :(
[11:56:51] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/f5v47r3c/3/  <-- strange can you see?
[11:57:12] <Foxhoundz> jak2000: http://jsfiddle.net/f5v47r3c/4/
[11:58:08] <jak2000> yes.... or if put directly
[11:58:14] <jak2000> in the val property
[11:58:45] <jak2000> other thing why i need write in this format: MM/dd/YYYY? why not in: YYYY/MM/dd ?
[12:14:55] <jak2000> Foxhoundz: var d = new Date(2015, 0, 19);   <--- represents: 2015/01/19   right?
[12:17:15] <xgFx> derstrom: thanks for that offer. i found a workaround i'll use until i understand what i did wrong. -> workaround is to add two empty li-elements into the ul.

[14:09:00] <revolve> does anyone know how to bind to resource requests?
[14:09:45] <revolve> I'm trying to bind to every <img>, <link> and <script> type of request
[14:44:10] <__Charles> Hey, I am having an issue with Ajax, would this be a good place to ask it?  If not, do you know of a better channel?
[14:55:42] <Patero-ng> can someone help me install this code into my website? http://codepen.io/PierrickGT/pen/wBLRvX#0 it's a cute turn your cellphone animation
[14:58:26] <__Charles> https://jsbin.com/gotifojehe/1/edit?js - this is the AJAX function that I am using.  It works, I get the 'success' function part, but its not returning what I believe it should be
[14:58:49] <revolve> Patero-ng: my consulting fee is £1.80 for that :-)
[14:59:36] <Patero-ng> how can I pay you
[14:59:50] <revolve> if you wanna send me some connection details in exchange for transfer details I can actually get this done pretty swiftly, you'll just need to outline where it's being placed exactly
[14:59:57] <shoky> __Charles: it should return whatever your server responded with
[15:00:32] <revolve> best to show us the site, realistically, and I'll give you a pointer and you see if you can't do it yourself first
[15:00:42] <shoky> __Charles: check the request in your browser's devtools
[15:01:36] <__Charles> shoky I have checked the POST and its sending the correct info over to the php, but im not getting what I expect back...
[15:01:45] <Patero-ng> revolve, this is my site 174.23.62.9
[15:01:47] <Patero-ng> 2
[15:02:14] <revolve> not accepting connections, is it bound to 0.0.0.0?
[15:02:32] <Patero-ng> 174.23.62.92 works
[15:03:06] <Patero-ng> I don't know waht ip is bound to I'm not on linux I'm on windows 7
[15:03:12] <shoky> __Charles: if the server is not responding with what you want it to respond, that's a server-side issue
[15:03:13] <revolve> ah got it
[15:04:34] <shoky> __Charles: and i meant to check the response to that request in the devtools, to see the raw data sent back by the server
[15:04:56] <__Charles> shoky: ill check it
[15:05:34] <__Charles> in the response im getting the whole parent div that the onclick is in.
[15:06:21] <revolve> Patero-ng: it's going to look exactly like that codepen example, constantly. are you ok with just the phone, sans purple background?
[15:06:30] <shoky> __Charles: well that's what the server is responding with..
[15:08:28] <shoky> __Charles: and that's the same thing that's being logged to console
[15:09:34] <shoky> __Charles: btw don't use async:false   (and definitely don't use  async:'false' like you have now :P)
[15:09:58] <__Charles> well, i was trying different things haha... that obviously didnt fix it, i just havent changed it yet
[15:10:32] <Patero-ng> I don't know how it works I don't want to change my background too much
[15:10:34] <shoky> again, if the server is not responding with what you want it to respond, you'll need to fix that on the serverside
[15:11:54] <revolve> Patero-ng: keep your background
[15:12:09] <Patero-ng> is a photo of halloween
[15:12:25] <Patero-ng> hehe
[15:12:32] <Patero-ng> is past due I know
[15:12:34] <revolve> Patero-ng: you've obviously got some familiarity with css already, so you can do this for free
[15:12:52] <revolve> hit the compiled source buttons on the top left box
[15:13:09] <revolve> on the top middle box, remove the stanza for setting back purple background and hit the compiled source button on that one as well
[15:13:21] <Patero-ng> I 'm confuse about the part where all that html hacks are
[15:13:37] <revolve> there aren't any it's just transform()
[15:14:14] <Patero-ng> like that code .center I don't think that's an html
[15:14:16] <Patero-ng> I don't know what it is
[15:14:22] <revolve> that's css
[15:14:32] <Patero-ng> but it's on the html tab on that site
[15:14:59] <revolve> click "view compiled"
[15:15:07] <revolve> that's what you're actually integrating
[15:15:47] <revolve> for the css, remove the "body { background-color: }" part, and grab the "view compiled" version of that
[15:16:35] <revolve> here's the tricky bit. you're going to need to put that html in a div with its own class
[15:17:03] <revolve> something like <div class="cellphone"> ...the html from that top left box here... </div>
[15:17:28] <revolve> and in the css, change "ul,li" to ".cellphone > ul,li"
[15:17:50] <Patero-ng> tricky!
[15:18:17] <revolve> aye
[15:18:47] <revolve> that'll be 70p though. (kidding)
[15:20:31] <Patero-ng> your site is probably a pro looking one
[15:30:03] <gambl0re> any angular users?
[15:30:35] <rcyr> Because the best channel to ask about angular is of course... #jQuery.
[15:30:41] <rcyr> Makes total sense.
[16:02:25] <mxxp_14482258687> hi
[16:11:44] <jak2000> rcyr
[16:11:47] <jak2000> are you teher?
[16:12:07] <derstrom> jak2000: Have you got a question?
[16:17:31] <jak2000> hi derstrom
[16:17:35] <jak2000> onlye talking
[16:17:46] <jak2000> moment is a library only for date time right?
[16:21:18] <Patero-ng> revolve,
[16:21:30] <derstrom> jak2000: Not sure what your question is.
[16:22:03] <Patero-ng> revolve, I installed sort of the cell phone turn around animation but I'm not sure is it 100% correct can you check my site and tell me if is working?
[16:26:49] <arc_> chrome allows you to set your user agent and window size to popular devices
[16:27:04] <arc_> just click the icon that looks like a smartphone at the top left of the inspector
[16:41:43] <revolve> Patero-ng: you wanna not have it in that .center div
[16:41:56] <revolve> and change the border attribute on it to none
[16:43:00] <revolve> specifically .content { border: none; } integrated into the .content stanza
[17:04:30] <jak2000> why: var d = new Date(2015, 6, 11); $('#fecha_start').datepicker('setDate', d).datepicker('option', 'dateFormat', 'yy-mm-dd');  when the datetimepicker was displayed it contains the actual date.... 22/11/2015
[17:06:29] <derstrom> jak2000: you need to paste the full code on jsfiddle so we can see the full context
[17:10:06] <jak2000> here work: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/81207uua/    but not in my production code :(
[17:13:07] <jak2000> strange strange 1) checked the libraries, 2) checked if exist errors NO Errors,
[17:31:41] <derstrom> jak2000: Can you explain what your problem is?
[17:32:44] <jak2000> var d = new Date(2015,2,23);   $('#fecha_start').datepicker('setDate', d).datepicker('option', 'dateFormat', 'yy-mm-dd');
[17:33:33] <Rueda> revolve, I don't see .content I see .center and .smartphone and variables of smartphone. But is looking great what would those changes do in my favor
[17:34:16] <jak2000> when the calendar is displayed, it not was displayed in date: 2015/03/23  the calendar display the actual date: 2015/11/22   :(
[17:36:21] <jak2000> too not work: $('#fecha_start').datepicker({ dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy'}).datepicker("setDate", new Date(2015, 2, 17));
[17:36:22] <derstrom> jak2000: Do you have a published version I can see with this problem?
[17:36:33] <jak2000> ok
[17:36:38] <jak2000> making....
[17:36:44] <derstrom> Because what you are doing is correct, so it should work.
[17:37:32] <jak2000> yes
[17:37:47] <jak2000> the only difference into fiddle and my production code, is moment.js
[17:38:37] <derstrom> If you can publish what you're doing also with moment.js, hopefully then the problem is reproduced so we can try and identify what the problem is being caused by.
[17:38:59] <jak2000> yes opening router ports...
[17:39:45] <derstrom> jak2000: That's one way of doing it. Although I was expecting you to upload it to a website on the Internet instead.
[17:41:13] <jak2000> derstrom: http://187.253.71.81:55094/jChaol/servletIrMovCalendario
[17:41:36] <jak2000> see first:http://187.253.71.81:55094/jChaol/js/movCalendario.js
[17:42:19] <jak2000> see this function: function MuestraVentanaCita() {
[17:42:56] <jak2000> in this line: $('#fecha_start').datepicker({ dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy'}).datepicker("setDate", new Date(2015, 2, 17));   i stored the date: 2015/03/17 right?
[17:43:32] <jak2000> click on any day on the calendar pls, and immediatly you see the problem never never say the date: 2015/03/17
[17:44:19] <derstrom> jak2000: Well what I do know is datepicker will display the date that is listed in the text box regardless.
[17:45:23] <derstrom> so if you changed the month in the textbox and put focus on the textbox again, the datepicker will change accordingly
[17:45:48] <jak2000> yes but
[17:46:17] <jak2000> i need initially configure the value of the textbox with the Day click selected( and hour)
[17:46:43] <jak2000> then when calendar is displayed i need display the the textbox date value
[17:46:46] <jak2000> understand me?
[17:48:33] <derstrom> jak2000: I might be wrong but I actually think the problem here is that you are resetting the datepicker so it is using the current date/time. (https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/81207uua/ see line 18)
[17:49:18] <jak2000> yes i see
[17:49:38] <jak2000> and try, (before display the modal window) setting the datetimepiker date
[17:50:31] <jak2000> see line 84: view-source:http://187.253.71.81:55094/jChaol/js/movCalendario.js
[17:52:04] <derstrom> jak2000: I don't know what the documentation is for datepicker() but I suspect you can pass multiple options in the first parameter
[17:52:12] <derstrom> i.e. dateFormat, setDate, etc.
[17:57:55] <derstrom> http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/ this is what you use?
[17:59:34] <jak2000> yes :)
[18:00:38] <derstrom> jak2000: so I think the problem with your code is you are effectively not setting a date for the datepicker to use, so it uses the date/time now.
[18:02:41] <jak2000> ok see please the line 77 on view-source:http://187.253.71.81:55094/jChaol/js/movCalendario.js
[18:03:36] <jak2000> finally the goal is: setting up the value(date/time) selected on the calendar, see the wstart_date (at the right): http://postimg.org/image/8kfw6itlh/
[18:07:34] <jak2000> the line 77 is commented, but i need do this: 1) click on day and hour for create a appointment, and then show the dialog form
[18:09:25] <derstrom> jak2000: well I can see you have the date for each box as "data-date" attribute. I suspect what you need to do (or are already attempting to do) is gran the value of this attribute and then split the value into an array of three values separated by the dash ( - ), which is possible with the split() method
[18:09:45] <derstrom> grab, not gran
[18:10:16] <derstrom> and then create a new Date() with the supplied value from "data-date"
[18:14:05] <derstrom> jak2000: I don't know if this is of any help to you, but here is an example: https://jsfiddle.net/5w538nft/
[18:14:27] <derstrom> the code example is for illustrative purposes only, I haven't tested it
[18:14:57] <derstrom> you'd have to make changes to get it to work etc.
[18:16:09] <derstrom> we're using parseInt() here because when we split the string into an array, the array indexes hold string values
[18:18:24] <derstrom> jak2000: let me know if this is helpful
[18:19:57] <jak2000> derstrom: is similar to: var d = new Date(2015,2,23);  $('#fecha_start').datepicker('setDate', d);   right?
[18:20:04] <jak2000> not work :(
[18:20:27] <derstrom> well if I understand what you want to do, you want to automatically set the datepicker to have the day that the user has selected from the calendar, right?
[18:20:37] <jak2000> yes
[18:20:56] <derstrom> and I can see each calender option has a back-end "data-date" attribute
[18:20:57] <jak2000> if you see: http://postimg.org/image/8kfw6itlh/
[18:21:27] <jak2000> yes
[18:22:12] <derstrom> jak2000: I don't know what I am looking at with this screenshot.
[18:22:42] <jak2000> wstart_Date variable  (in this variable is stored the DATETime user choose
[18:23:10] <jak2000> i can get date: var xDate1 = wstart_date.format('YYYY/MM/DD');
[18:23:11] <jak2000> and
[18:23:16] <jak2000> var xTime1 = wstart_date.format('HH:mm');
[18:23:35] <jak2000> i checked... and is correct the value of xDate1, and xTime1 variables.
[18:23:49] <jak2000> but how to whith these values, setting the datetime picker :(
[18:24:45] <derstrom> I assume when a user clicks on a date on the calendar, the click event is all your own code?
[18:24:54] <derstrom> or is this part of the fullCalendar library?
[18:25:10] <jak2000> yes
[18:25:19] <jak2000> is own code
[18:25:42] <derstrom> OK in which case something like this should work: https://jsfiddle.net/5w538nft/
[18:25:48] <derstrom> since each calendar option has a "data-date" attribute
[18:26:01] <derstrom> this is how you would set 'd' to have the date of the user-selected option
[18:26:09] <jak2000> mm yes
[18:26:53] <derstrom> bear in mind, however, that the value is a string and must be converted to an integer to be passed to Date()
[18:26:59] <derstrom> I have covered this in the code example
[18:27:36] <derstrom> I first split the attribute values into an array, so index 0 has the year, index 1 has the month and index 2 has the day
[18:28:26] <jak2000> yes understand
[18:28:27] <derstrom> then use parseInt() when creating the new Date object
[18:28:29] <derstrom> :)
[18:28:31] <jak2000> but would be similar to:
[18:28:42] <jak2000> var d = new Date(2015,2,23);  $('#fecha_start').datepicker('setDate', d);   right?
[18:29:09] <derstrom> well, yes, the whole point is trying to change the 'd' variable so that it holds the date of the currently selected calendar option, right?
[18:29:32] <derstrom> so this code would be in the click event handler that is fired when a user selects a calendar option
[18:29:37] <jak2000> man
[18:29:42] <jak2000> i think know the problem
[18:29:50] <derstrom> cool, let me know :)
[18:30:09] <jak2000> not solved but i think exist a conflict
[18:30:12] <jak2000> see again: http://187.253.71.81:55094/jChaol/servletIrMovCalendario
[18:30:18] <jak2000> see the source code....
[18:30:30] <jak2000> see  line 36 and 62
[18:30:50] <derstrom> line 36 and 62 of what file?
[18:30:53] <derstrom> the .js?
[18:31:00] <jak2000> yes
[18:31:15] <derstrom> what's the URL to the .js again?
[18:31:27] <jak2000> view-source:http://localhost:55094/jChaol/js/movCalendario.js
[18:32:08] <jak2000> i write 2 alerts see?
[18:32:20] <derstrom> yes, what about them?
[18:32:26] <jak2000> test the page, click on any day... and wich alert was displayed first?
[18:32:53] <derstrom> yes that makes sense, dayClick is fired when a user selects a day from the calendar
[18:33:00] <jak2000> and select?
[18:33:08] <derstrom> second
[18:33:16] <derstrom> I wonder if fullCalender returns the date that is selected?
[18:33:18] <jak2000> wich is the, correct?
[18:33:24] <jak2000> yes
[18:33:27] <jak2000> wait
[18:34:52] <jak2000> click agan in one day...
[18:35:03] <jak2000> you get 4 alers, right?
[18:35:28] <jak2000> *alerts
[18:36:23] <derstrom> yes, 4th alert displays the correct date
[18:36:29] <jak2000> yes
[18:36:50] <jak2000> when select, call MuestraVentanaCita()
[18:38:05] <jak2000> the first alert with date was called by 'dayclick'
[18:38:38] <jak2000> the second(correct) when 'select' call: MuestraVentanaCita()
[18:38:57] <jak2000> then i think i erase all dayClick code, right?
[18:39:00] <jak2000> in first time
[18:41:48] <derstrom> jak2000: OK I have done some research and I can see on line 35, the "start" variable holds the date that has been selected, so the wstart_date contains the date that the user selected from the calendar.
[18:42:21] <jak2000> yes
[18:42:29] <derstrom> jak2000: it's very hard to understand what you're saying
[18:43:09] <jak2000> erased dayclick event
[18:43:37] <jak2000> testing
[18:49:11] <derstrom> jak2000: According to the documentation, select is fired "after a selection is made", and "dayClick" is fired "when the user clicks on a day". Looks like "select" is fired first. I believe in both cases the first parameter contains the date that the user has selected. It should return an ambiguously-timed moment (i.e. representing the full day): http://fullcalendar.io/docs/utilities/Moment/#ambiguously-timed
[18:53:30] <derstrom> jak2000: Hope you manage to sort it out.
[18:54:20] <jak2000> ok thanks
[18:54:25] <jak2000> i tell you how to fix
[18:54:27] <jak2000> :)
[18:55:11] <jak2000> derstrom: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1953840/datepickersetdate-issues-in-jquery
[18:56:25] <derstrom> jak2000: Looks like it's similar to what I suggested regarding parsing the date string.
[18:58:03] <jak2000> yes
[18:58:06] <jak2000> testing
[18:58:13] <derstrom> cool
[19:04:25] <jak2000> queryDate = '2009-11-01'; var parsedDate = $.datepicker.parseDate('yy-mm-dd', queryDate); $('#datePicker').datepicker('setDate', parsedDate);
[19:04:30] <jak2000> not work, testing other way
[19:16:39] <jak2000> derstrom  none of the answers solved my problem :(
[19:25:01] <derstrom> jak2000: Why are you setting a fixed date to queryDate?
[19:25:16] <derstrom> I thought you wanted the date to be based on the currently selected calendar option?
[19:26:22] <groberts> hey guys, this mousover and mouseout event is buggy if you go in and out too many times. The mouse out event will stick if you go in the center and leave really fast. Help to get rid of this bug?
[19:26:22] <groberts> http://jsfiddle.net/bqr5osh8/
[19:27:45] <jak2000> fixed date: var queryDate = '2009-11-01'; ?
[19:27:57] <derstrom> yes, that looks like a fixed date to me
[19:27:58] <jak2000> yes you are right
[19:28:27] <jak2000> NO fixed date: var queryDate = '2009-11-01 12:03:36'; ?
[19:28:27] <derstrom> don't you want queryDate to be based on the date provided in data-date attribute?
[19:29:21] <derstrom> groberts: I have similar issues with that. I think the problem is the event is basically not fired at all if you move your cursor out of the element too fast.
[19:29:53] <derstrom> I have never found a solution to that myself.
[19:30:08] <derstrom> I try and avoid relying on it.
[19:30:39] <derstrom> I think what you want to do, however, can be replicated with CSS and transitions.
[19:31:11] <groberts> So I should move away from jquery when dealing with this?
[19:31:20] <daslicht> groberts: funny issue
[19:31:26] <groberts> It is. Very weird.
[19:31:43] <derstrom> groberts: Well consider looking at replacing the jQuery with CSS, because you can perform basic stuff like that with CSS 3 transitions.
[19:31:55] <derstrom> I don't know how well it'll work, but I know it's possible. Give it a go.
[19:32:25] <derstrom> You just need to add the increased width/height in :hover, and have the transition property set to an appropriate value
[19:32:43] <groberts> Alright, let me try it out and i'll let you know what I find!
[19:32:45] <groberts> Thanks you
[19:32:49] <groberts> Thank*
[19:34:27] <derstrom> groberts: e.g. "transition: all 200ms ease 0s" (you may want to test between "ease" and "linear"
[19:34:55] <groberts> Thanks!
[19:34:58] <derstrom> For cross-browser support, you may need to use -webkit and -moz prefix
[19:35:21] <derstrom> See: http://caniuse.com/#search=transitions
[19:36:19] <derstrom> jak2000: I don't really understand what you want to do, I thought I understood but maybe I don't. Sorry!
[19:36:52] <jak2000> ok no problem
[19:37:07] <derstrom> If you want queryDate to have the date of the user-selected calendar option, then you need to look at the documentation for "select" and "dayClick"
[19:37:10] <jak2000> is simple, user select a date. time on the calendar, i want show it on datetimepicker
[19:37:17] <derstrom> yes, and it is possible
[19:37:26] <jak2000> i try
[19:37:28] <jak2000> :(
[19:38:00] <derstrom> in "select" or "dayClick"?
[19:38:45] <jak2000> in select
[19:39:22] <derstrom> is it MuestraVentanaCita() ?
[19:39:31] <jak2000> yes
[19:39:40] <jak2000> only call a function/method
[19:39:50] <derstrom> wstart_date will be empty in the function, since it's out of scope
[19:39:53] <derstrom> (I think?)
[19:39:58] <jak2000> i can move the code of MuestraVentanaCita() ?  to 'select'
[19:39:59] <printForever> I need to updated a div on the page, after another div has been updated. Is that possible?
[19:40:06] <jak2000> ok moving the code
[19:40:15] <derstrom> jak2000: you are defining the wstart_date in the "select" function handler
[19:40:20] <derstrom> it won't be visible to MuestraVentanaCita()
[19:40:34] <printForever> I just need to copy the content from the div that is changed to a new div.
[19:41:02] <jak2000> was declard, global variable
[19:41:08] <jak2000> but ok moving the code to 'select'
[19:41:20] <derstrom> yes try that
[19:41:23] <derstrom> interesting to see
[19:41:26] <printForever> can I use .change()
[19:41:37] <derstrom> jak2000: I can see you have declared wstart_date at the top, yes
[19:42:28] <printForever> and is there a way to filter the content?
[19:42:39] <jak2000>  nooooooooooooo
[19:42:41] <jak2000> view-source:http://187.253.71.81:55094/jChaol/js/movCalendario.js
[19:42:47] <printForever> I have $20.99 and I want to remove $ and use just 20.99
[19:42:54] <derstrom> jak2000: Don't call MuestraVentanaCita() in the "dayClick" event, it is already being called in the "select" event
[19:43:05] <jak2000> yes see the code... please
[19:43:18] <printForever> like, filter the first character and just copy the rest of the content
[19:44:48] <printForever> anyone?
[19:46:43] <daslicht> just split teh string?
[19:46:54] <printForever> daslicht, how?
[19:46:57] <derstrom> jak2000: https://jsfiddle.net/x3d0up86/ this won't work?
[19:47:00] <daslicht> let me try something
[19:47:07] <printForever> daslicht, ok
[19:47:14] <derstrom> jak2000: surely it will
