[00:05:51] <Whirl3d> shoky? What sorrows?
[00:14:44] <malikmasr> would it be best to use jquery to sort the data on a page, or send ajax request to database and receive the data already sorted?
[00:14:48] <malikmasr> which is more efficient
[00:15:09] <coldhead> its more efficient for the server if the client sorts it
[00:15:18] <coldhead> and it's more efficient for the client if it's already sprted
[00:15:21] <coldhead> sorted*
[00:15:59] <malikmasr> which method is preferred
[00:16:07] <malikmasr> i mean either way will put more work on either the server or client
[00:17:12] <coldhead> i'd go with whichever is easiest for the developer
[00:17:18] <malikmasr> i guess im curious which method is preferred or considered better practice
[00:17:18] <jshannon> hi. i have a ul with 500+ LIs, and an array with a portion of those LIs in a specific order. what's the fastest way to hide all and reorder and show the LIs within the UL?
[00:17:27] <malikmasr> ok, well, im not really sure how to sort on client
[00:17:27] <coldhead> if you're just hitting a database table and you can SORT BY foo
[00:17:32] <coldhead> that's the least trouble
[00:17:37] <malikmasr> yeah the database is simpler
[00:17:41] <coldhead> client sorting is generally trickier
[00:17:55] <coldhead> it's nice if you want to let the user resort in the browser
[00:18:02] <coldhead> but i'd keep it simple if i can get away with it
[00:18:37] <malikmasr> ok, thanks
[00:20:03] <oskude> hi, is there a function like closest, but that finds the first selector _anywhere_ in dom? http://jsfiddle.net/aQSF2/1/
[00:22:21] <coldhead> oskude: http://jsfiddle.net/aQSF2/2/
[00:23:11] <oskude> coldhead: that looks backwards relative to the e.target and finds the first?
[00:24:02] <oskude> coldhead: or just finds the first "a" from top of dom?
[00:24:10] <coldhead> just finds the first
[00:24:16] <coldhead> this is probably what you mean: http://jsfiddle.net/aQSF2/3/
[00:24:28] <coldhead> searches each parent, closest first
[00:25:04] <oskude> yeah, was wondering if theres a function for it
[00:25:15] <oskude> or why closest() doesnt find it
[00:25:28] <oskude> or prev(), or prevAll()
[00:25:49] <Whirl3d> closest finds things in the same heirarchy
[00:26:01] <Whirl3d> prev and prevall finds things on the same level of the heirarchy
[00:26:08] <Whirl3d> what you want is great aunt
[00:26:17] <Whirl3d> or great uncle or great great aunt or....
[00:26:19] <Whirl3d> it's tricker
[00:26:23] <Whirl3d> trickier
[00:26:45] <oskude> ok
[00:26:58] <oskude> coldhead: thanks for this manual way then :)
[00:27:46] <Whirl3d> coldhead, so parents() will do all the parent() elements up the heirarchy?
[00:28:18] <coldhead> yup
[00:28:19] <coldhead> in order
[00:28:32] <coldhead> its usually used with a filter
[00:28:35] <Whirl3d> dang that is so nice. I never knew that. Thanks...
[00:28:38] <coldhead> .parents('div')
[00:28:44] <coldhead> to only get the divs
[00:28:52] <coldhead> it's what closest grew out of
[00:29:52] <coldhead> I HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS DREAM OF YOU SERENE SURROUNDED IN A SUNFLOWER SEED
[00:31:21] <Zhy> coldhead continue please
[00:31:40] <coldhead> that's the best bit, the rest is noise
[00:33:46] <Zhy> hmm okay guess I'll have to settle with that *hums the tetris melody*
[00:35:15] <coldhead> good choice!
[00:38:43] <atno> can someone confirm that javascript run top to bottom and all variable are global unless declared local using 'var' ?
[00:40:42] <coldhead> yes atno
[00:40:48] <coldhead> EXCEPT for variable hoisting
[00:40:56] <coldhead> for more on which ask google
[00:41:10] <majd> Hey #jQuery - is there a way to get the same behaviour in Prototype's .serialize(true) function in jquery?
[00:41:11] <atno> search for what exactly ?
[00:41:23] <majd> here's Prototype's docs, for reference: http://prototypejs.org/api/form/serialize
[00:41:28] <coldhead> "javascript variable hoisting"
[00:41:42] <coldhead> and possibly "how to search for keywords using google"
[00:41:46] <coldhead> :P
[00:41:51] <atno> whatever
[00:41:53] <Whirl3d> lol,gladly, gimme a minute or two to learn prototype and I'll be able to help. brb. lol
[00:41:58] <coldhead> how rude
[00:42:52] <Whirl3d> hey majd, while I am learning prototype,maybe you could checkout jquery .serialize?
[00:43:00] <Whirl3d> ? seriealize
[00:43:02] <bot-t> Whirl3d, .serialize() - Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[00:43:49] <coldhead> bot-t: you handled that typo gracefully, kudos
[00:43:49] <bot-t> coldhead, Is that a question?
[00:44:06] <coldhead> bot-t: you know it isn't. little fella
[00:44:06] <bot-t> coldhead, Is that a question?
[00:44:07] <Whirl3d> I'm serious....that was amazing...
[00:44:34] <majd> Whirl3d, jquery serializes to a string, i want to serialize to an object so i can POST it to the backend written in python (django)
[00:44:55] <oskude> dammit, in the jsfiddle it works (when i add more entries) but in my code it finds all <a> elements :/
[00:45:21] <coldhead> you might need a more advanced search, oskude
[00:45:25] <coldhead> nested loops
[00:45:34] <coldhead> outermost with parents and innermost with siblings()
[00:45:34] <Whirl3d> majd, and there weren't any links in the api to other serialize methods for jquery, odd....
[00:45:39] <coldhead> to find the "true" closest
[00:45:53] <coldhead> the difficulty is that "closest" is not rigorously defined
[00:45:55] <dirkpennings> Cork: bit late, but thanks for the link, great! :)
[00:47:22] <oskude> coldhead: my html structure should be this http://jsfiddle.net/aQSF2/4/ but in my code it finds all the <a>s, weird
[00:47:34] <Whirl3d> majd, perhaps http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[00:48:11] <coldhead> :first @ oskude
[00:48:16] <coldhead> guh
[00:48:18] <coldhead> ?:first @ oskude
[00:48:18] <bot-t> oskude, :first: Selects the first matched element. http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[00:48:21] <majd> Whirl3d: i tried serializeArray out, but didn't work :(
[00:48:39] <Whirl3d> jsfiddle it my friend, jsfiddle it.
[00:49:19] <oskude> coldhead: i wonder why it works in that jsfiddle but not in my code
[00:49:32] <coldhead> because the fiddle is simpler?
[00:49:38] <majd> well, the backend i'm using is on my local machine, so it won't be accessible from jsfiddle...
[00:49:43] <coldhead> the HTML is different?
[00:50:06] <oskude> gotta double check
[00:54:13] <oskude> ah yeah, not exactly same, has other <a> in the same parent as, but after e.target. ok, ill add more parent() :)
[00:55:51] <coldhead> good luck oskude
[00:56:24] <oskude> $(e.target).parent().parent().parents().each does the trick, thanks coldhead
[00:57:04] <chintanparikh> Hey people - I'm having a bit of an issue with dynamically setting heights
[00:57:23] <chintanparikh> Basically, I want to height of a .well element to be the height of the largest element in that row
[00:57:30] <noregret> when append()ing, the page scrolls to the appended content, how can I avoid that ? meaning that the page stays in its same scroll spot
[00:57:35] <chintanparikh> Is that possible? Here's a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/4HxVT/34/
[00:57:38] <coldhead> oskude: this may help if you want to get real crazy http://sandbox.teo.sk/jquery-family/
[00:57:58] <Cork> noregret: thats normally caused by the scroll to hit the end of the page
[00:58:49] <Cork> noregret: if thats not it, then your doing something else that does it, append doens't cause scroll
[00:59:22] <oskude> coldhead: the thing is, i wanted to use something where i dont have to care, and just "find the first selector thats anywhere in dom, before e.target" :P
[00:59:55] <oskude> +looking backwards/upwards
[01:00:17] <Cork> chintanparikh: you need + 'px'
[01:01:10] <chintanparikh> Oh, no that jsfiddle isn't actually doing what I need. Right now, it's just grabbing the height of the first .well element and applying it to them all
[01:01:23] <coldhead> thank goddess you're here, Cork, i was going to say she needed .each()
[01:01:36] * coldhead is gomfuse
[01:01:54] <chintanparikh> What I want, is for it to grab the height of the longest .well element on that row (.row-fluid), and assign the height of all the .well elements in that row to that height
[01:01:59] <Cork> coldhead: heh that too
[01:02:01] <chintanparikh> It's a bit hard to explain :/
[01:02:17] <Cork> coldhead: at least if he wants to set it on every instance of the class :)
[01:02:18] <SeekingGuidance> Dear All. I have a requirement to have a Simple Text Box. I need to enter a number in the text box and a URL is called with that numberin  POST Data. There is a DB lookup and a HTML is returned. I would like to refresh the original Page with data returned from post Call. What should be the way to go about this? Please guide.
[01:03:13] <Cork> chintanparikh: you need to add 'px' after the value when you add it to the css; and you need to loop over the matched elements
[01:03:29] <Cork> chintanparikh: css and height only work on the first matched element
[01:04:08] <EnginA> hey guys
[01:04:12] <chintanparikh> Ah I see. I assume I'd loop over with a .each?
[01:04:18] <Cork> yes
[01:04:43] <chintanparikh> Also, how would I grab the height of the largest element in that row?
[01:04:45] <EnginA> i want to make a WYSIWYG IDE. any recommended toolkits ? I need standard controls/widgets such as accordions, tree views etc.
[01:05:16] <EnginA> users will drag drop components from a toolbox, export the project, and it will be publicly visible etc.
[01:05:41] <styol> EnginA: why not look into improving one of the many existing options #justsaying
[01:05:48] <styol> or fork a beast
[01:06:50] <EnginA> I'll be doing a WYSIWYG IDE that users will drag drop special components (not standard), such as gauges, indicators, sliders. Then I'll generate special HTML and other stuff that'll create a UI for some other purpose.
[01:07:13] <Cork> chintanparikh: var height = 0; $(this).each(function() { if(height < $(this).height()= { height = $(this).height(); } });
[01:07:18] <Cork> opps
[01:07:19] <EnginA> surely, I'll be glad to examine a framework that offers something similar to that, i.e. drag-drop components from toolbox, move, resize and edit properties of them.
[01:07:44] <Cork> chintanparikh: var height = 0; $(this).find('.child').each(function() { if(height < $(this).height()= { height = $(this).height(); } });
[01:08:05] <Cork> chintanparinow sure what it is you want to check for each .well so...
[01:08:34] <EnginA> I have already prototyped IDEs based on Visual Studio and Eclipse frameworks. Now I'd like to explore an HTML/JS counterpar because it'll remove distribution, deployment and updating problems. And our application is a very connected one anyway.
[01:08:59] <EnginA> any idea where should I start looking at ?
[01:09:06] <Cork> chintanparikh: or did you want to look each row-fluid and set the .well to the highest value for that row?
[01:09:08] <styol> EnginA: you are probably right regarding you initial question, outside of jquery UI which can do most of this, there must be some similar project.. sounds too awesome haha.. maybe look more along the lines of web site generation or something
[01:09:35] <chintanparikh> Cork: Yup, each .row-fluid
[01:10:04] <SeekingGuidance> Could someone please help?
[01:10:05] <chintanparikh> So each .well should have the maximum height for that row
[01:10:11] <SeekingGuidance> Dear All. I have a requirement to have a Simple Text Box. I need to enter a number in the text box and a URL is called with that numberin  POST Data. There is a DB lookup and a HTML is returned. I would like to refresh the original Page with data returned from post Call. What should be the way to go about this? Please guide.
[01:10:42] <EnginA> the thing I'm most curious about is there any toolkit that'd provide abstraction I'd need to implement that drag/drop, move, resize (handles) stuff.
[01:10:43] <styol> EnginA: ah a web app.. well, one option I can think of to turn web apps into apps for desktops is adobe air but I'm not sure that is a great recommendation
[01:11:02] <EnginA> I'm not looking for desktop apps.
[01:11:04] <styol> jquery UI yeah
[01:11:09] <Cork> chintanparikh:  $('.row-fluid').each(function() { var height = 0: $(this).find('.well').each(function() { if(height < $(this).height()) { height = $(this).height(); } }).each(function() { $(this).height(height); }); });
[01:11:15] <styol> has all that and a bag of chips
[01:11:27] <styol> plus bunches examples
[01:11:30] <SeekingGuidance> Could someone please guide?
[01:11:33] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: ajax?
[01:11:40] <EnginA> yeah, i should look jqui more throughly
[01:11:49] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: but i didnt quite understand what you want
[01:11:58] <styol> EnginA: just peep the examples real quick
[01:11:58] <EnginA> damn this feels right, i think i'll give this a try haha
[01:12:01] <chintanparikh> Cork: Any chance you could pastebin that for me? My irc client's playing up, won't let me copy and paste
[01:12:13] <EnginA> sounds like an exiting project
[01:12:33] <EnginA> yeah, i'm looking at the resizing example
[01:12:52] <EnginA> it seems to work, though lacks many visual feedbacks, which I think I can add
[01:13:02] <Cork> chintanparikh: http://jsfiddle.net/9NYvp/
[01:13:07] <SeekingGuidance> oskude, I am using Django which is a Python based Web Framework. When a form is submitted, Django can return a HTML template in response to the form submission.  Using that i have to load data in a tanle in a HTML page.
[01:13:21] <SeekingGuidance> Can i use Ajax?
[01:14:34] <chintanparikh> Cork: Perfect, thanks so much
[01:15:11] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: for easier use in js, i would make it return json rather than html
[01:15:29] <styol> EnginA: each module tends to have a couple examples (in the tabs iirc) but it naturally integrated with jquery pretty well.. definitely a decent springboard for some fun UI stuff ;)
[01:15:40] <styol> *integrates
[01:15:54] <SeekingGuidance> oskude, i think i can handle that. Could u please lead me to a simple example of usage?
[01:16:45] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/AJAX:Getting_Started or some jquery specific docs
[01:18:00] <oskude> jquery does make it a little easier: $.ajax({type: "POST", url: window.location.href, data: data}).done(got_ajax);
[01:18:49] <Whirl3d> jeesh, I gotta run statistics  on the number of times we see frameworks appear in a daily irc log because DJANGO has been showing up a lot lately..It's like everyone dropped Drupal for Django all at once.
[01:18:55] <SeekingGuidance> Thanks I will have a look oskude
[01:19:24] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: and then in got_ajax you would put the result in your html page
[01:19:40] <EnginA> styol: http://www.zkoss.org looks intersting too
[01:20:27] <SeekingGuidance> oskude, If i get a error in finding the number (that was entered in text box) in the db then what is the best way to show a popup which just fades away in a while?
[01:20:29] <chintanparikh> Cork: Hm, this is odd. It's working perfectly well on jsfiddle, but not so well when I actually stick it in my html file
[01:20:45] <chintanparikh> It grabs the largest .well element instead of the largest .well element in the row
[01:21:09] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: i use jqueryui dialog to show errors
[01:21:29] <SeekingGuidance> oskude, Where in .ajax call will it fit in exactly?
[01:21:57] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: when you get the result and it says if it found something or not?
[01:22:11] <styol> EnginA: yes indeed, you're asking in #jquery and I might naturally be biased and might look for a jquery based toolkit if I wasn't mobile haha
[01:22:36] <SeekingGuidance> oskude, I have been having a tough time in thinking what is that "if it found something or not?"
[01:22:44] <SeekingGuidance> Do i need to insepct the incoming data for certain pattterns?
[01:22:59] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: you cant modify the result server side?
[01:24:04] <SeekingGuidance> oskude, I can send result from server as result of POST request.But when it comes back to JQuery how do i tell it that DO a JQUeryUI dialog based on "Something"
[01:25:01] <EnginA> styol: yes, i love JQ, i looks something based on it, and this one also claims that too apparently
[01:25:09] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: you check if there was an ajax error, or error in your result/query. i have foo.OK = 1 or 0 in the result json to indicate that the query was ok
[01:25:35] <EnginA> styol: though it has its own development environment and technologies which is diferent than JQ which means another learning curve :D
[01:25:57] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: and if foo.OK = 0, i set foo.MSG to include the server error and display that to the user
[01:26:26] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: there might be better ways, but thats what i use atm.
[01:26:35] <SeekingGuidance> oskude, Suddenly it is making a little more sense now.....So in Server side i just need to set the json properly and then i will have better control right?
[01:26:58] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: i personally like json better. but you can use what ever format you want
[01:27:03] <styol> EnginA: seems like its worth a gander for sure
[01:29:27] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: mostly cause on client js side i can just do JSON.parse(the_result_text_from_ajax) and i have a js object to work with.
[01:30:05] <SeekingGuidance> Oh.
[01:30:30] <SeekingGuidance> oskude, I am reading this page now http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[01:32:27] <z3yo> Hi there
[01:32:29] <z3yo> How to simulate the old slots of symfony1 in symfony2 ?
[01:32:47] <coldhead> wrong channel, z3yo
[01:32:49] <coldhead> i am sorry
[01:33:00] <z3yo> Oops bad tab x)
[01:34:03] <coldhead> good luck bro
[01:34:19] <z3yo> thx coldhead ;)
[01:39:25] <juha_> hello there! is this the correct channel? i'm looking for a cracked serial key for jquery license
[01:39:52] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: maybe heres something useful too http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[01:40:11] <SeekingGuidance> Thanks oskude Checking that page now
[01:40:59] <SeekingGuidance> oskude, Will u be around during day time?
[01:41:36] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: which timezone? :P but no, im not often here, only when i have a problem :)
[01:41:39] <SeekingGuidance> Its 4.40 AM here for me...Was kind struggling with this but now it seems to be more manageable. Thanks for your help.
[01:41:49] <SeekingGuidance> LOL
[01:41:52] <coldhead> juha_: try #warez
[01:42:09] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: i bet heres more capable people than me, on any timezone :)
[01:42:16] <bnm> IIRC jquery does not require a serial key?
[01:42:20] <SeekingGuidance> :P
[01:42:25] <bnm> ...
[01:42:32] <juha_> coldhead: thanx! i hope there's some crackwizard who could crack jquery for me so i wouldn't need to pay the license, you know
[01:42:36] <coldhead> i think you need a key for jQuery enterprise
[01:42:37] <chintanparikh> Cork: You still around?
[01:42:54] <bnm> oh
[01:43:07] <bnm> wow, there's always something to learn
[01:43:40] <coldhead> http://enterprisejquery.com/
[01:44:44] <oskude> is that more than (paid) support?
[01:45:07] <coldhead> i doubt it, i don't know anyone who uses it
[01:45:28] <coldhead> but juha_ seems like the kind of jerk, he'll let us know
[01:45:37] <coldhead> heya amirite
[01:45:50] <juha_> you have to pay for the license and you need to put da license on the beginning of the code
[01:46:09] <ironside> aha what
[01:46:25] <coldhead> i think you might be thinking of photoshop, juha_
[01:46:26] <SeekingGuidance> ok oskude ... i will sleep now. have a nice day. Thanks for your gudance.
[01:46:36] <oskude> SeekingGuidance: np, gn8
[01:46:45] <coldhead> i can sell you the <script> tag load jQuery from google's l337 cdn
[01:46:51] <coldhead> but it'll cost you newds
[01:49:11] <siebo> I'm having an issue that I think has to do with events not being bound to elements created after the DOM has loaded
[01:49:25] <siebo> for example, I have a jQuery function which creates an element like this
[01:49:30] <NodeX> siebo : pastebin your code
[01:50:01] <siebo> NodeX: http://pastie.org/4276769
[01:50:13] <siebo> in my CMS, the $() operator is aliased to jq()
[01:50:36] <juha_> coldhead: wut
[01:50:37] <b-ot> Please resolve it. My Functions is Writedown below
[01:50:39] <siebo> the create-home-license and create-license events work just fine
[01:50:53] <atno> coldhead first sorry for being an asshole earlier, second thank you for your help
[01:50:56] <siebo> each of them writes a div with some medical license information pulled from the page
[01:51:03] <juha_> coldhead: i don't understand the difference between photoshop and jquery
[01:51:13] <oskude> siebo: you probably want $(document).ready()?
[01:51:36] <siebo> oskude: ah, ok I'll try that
[01:51:41] <NodeX> +1
[01:51:55] <siebo> so switch out:
[01:51:55] <siebo> jq(window).load(function()
[01:51:57] <siebo> for that?
[01:52:00] <oskude> yup
[01:52:21] <siebo> oskude: NodeX: ok, I'll do that now and see if it fixes it
[01:52:50] <oskude> siebo: good luck, im just guessing and didnt read the whole problem/code :P
[01:55:00] <coldhead> atno: we're cool, babe, #jQuery is pretty free and easy <3
[01:55:59] <atno> still no matter how tired i am, i had to reason to be like that, peace
[01:56:54] <horrror> need a good jquery plugin for modal that supports ajax with rails
[01:57:09] <Cristen> Hi everyone, when I do : $("input[type='checkbox']").length it says 2 ( and so : $("input[type='checkbox']").attr("name") says first) , but when I try $("input[type='checkbox']:first-child").attr("name") it says undefined why ?
[01:58:43] <NodeX> checkbox cant have a first child
[01:59:13] <Cristen> so how do I select the first checkbox then ?
[01:59:19] <Cristen> using .each() ?
[01:59:33] <liondance> Hi, I need help with seaofclouds twitter feed. I can't get it to work - worked at one time, doesn't work now.
[02:00:26] <siebo> oskude: NodeX: I changed the loading function, but it didn't solve my issue
[02:00:29] <NodeX> .first();
[02:00:37] <NodeX> or :first iirc
[02:00:39] <NodeX> ?first
[02:00:40] <bot-t> .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[02:00:54] <siebo> essentially, my jQ script adds an element like
[02:00:55] <siebo> <img src="delete.png" height="16" width="16" alt="delete"  class="delete-parent" />
[02:01:21] <siebo> but the jq(".delete-parent").click( function seems to never fire...
[02:01:27] <NodeX> you need on()
[02:01:46] <siebo> NodeX: me?
[02:01:51] <liondance> http://greenwei.com
[02:02:02] <Cristen> ok NodeX so if I won't the second checkbox I must use slice() ?
[02:02:04] <NodeX> $('body').on('click','.delete-parent',function(event){.. alert('clicked');});
[02:02:07] <Cristen> want*
[02:02:11] <liondance> Is this a good place to be asking?
[02:02:15] <NodeX> Cristen: eq();
[02:02:18] <NodeX> ?eq
[02:02:18] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[02:02:24] <Cristen> thanks a lot !
[02:02:34] <NodeX> second element would be eq(1);
[02:02:37] <NodeX> it's zero based
[02:02:57] <siebo> NodeX: cool, thanks.  I'll try that now
[02:02:57] <Cristen> sure$
[02:03:58] <NodeX> siebo : the reason is this .. at the time of the click bind.. the element doesn't exist so you have to use on() for future delegation
[02:04:45] <siebo> NodeX: aha… that was my original hunch, that the bindings were not automatically created for items not present when the document.ready init ran...

[02:22:02] <Strausser> Guys, how do I get element "offsetLeft" with jQ??
[02:22:17] <Strausser> .offset().left is not even close to be correct!
[02:26:48] <Strausser> Anyone? :P
[02:28:40] <siebo> Strausser: what does it mean offsetLeft?
[02:28:56] <siebo> NodeX: that fixed it, thanks!
[02:29:58] <Strausser> I have a li list in a scroll pane, and i want to get the offset of one of the lis
[02:31:49] <Strausser> in the DOM tree in firebug, I see there's a var called "offsetLeft", which is the one i want
[02:32:20] <Strausser> but, $elem.offset().left is not even close!
[02:32:54] <Strausser> this works however: document.querySelector('li.current').offsetLeft
[02:36:17] <Parhs> hello guys
[02:36:32] <Parhs> i am looking for a jquery gallery , but not the classic type.
[02:36:42] <Parhs> i just want thumbnails
[02:41:37] <EnginA> any recommended jq ui widget addons ?
[02:41:50] <EnginA> i think official jqui is not very comprehensive, am i wrong ?
[02:42:29] <Strausser> parhs: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/  something like this..?
[02:44:47] <Parhs> not exactly but thanks.
[02:45:34] <Parhs> maybe i'll create a custom one as it is very simple
[02:45:58] <EnginA> i'd be looking for a desktop-like-looking app in a browser. i.e. layout managers, toolboxes, top-menu.
[02:56:57] <EnginA> there's this one jqwidgets.com
[02:58:11] <AcademyIntl> I have an $.ajax POST that has an error handler, how would I go about making the error handler show the error occured...
[02:58:33] <AcademyIntl> In the error handler, the errorThrown is "PHP Error"; how would I show the actual error occuring?  (ie: display the page?)
[02:59:17] <Strausser> $("#msg").text("PHP Error") or something?
[02:59:41] <AcademyIntl> Strausser: No, I mean the actual error; the error handler has no data parameter.. ?
[03:00:16] <AcademyIntl> $.ajax error = function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)  How would I get the page "data" there, or is that not available?
[03:00:24] <Strausser> Hmm, need to refresh my memory then
[03:00:53] <NodeX> can please someone show me how to install jQuery 1.7 on my windows 98 server please?
[03:01:09] <Haprog> NodeX: you don't install it, you just use it.
[03:01:34] <Haprog> and it has nothing to do with your OS
[03:01:43] <AcademyIntl> I guess what I'm asking is, can I target the result of a $.ajax to the window itself, success or failure?  (ie: emulate a normal form submission that redirects the browser)
[03:02:40] <Strausser> You mean from "data"? i.e the result?
[03:02:55] <Haprog> AcademyIntl: If it's a PHP error you get, it doesn't go to the ajax error handler. it goes to the success handler. it only goes to error handler if it's a connection error or similar.
[03:03:19] <Haprog> and even in the error handler you have access to parameters error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[03:03:21] <_torn> hi, is there a way to get the html representation of an element - including the element itself? if I do $el.html() i only get the contents
[03:03:23] <Haprog> just check the manual
[03:03:25] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: Uhh.. nope :(  It's calling the error handler with errorThrown of "PHP Error" .. it didn't make sense to me either.
[03:03:58] <Haprog> weird
[03:04:41] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: textStatus=error  errorThrown=PHP Error
[03:05:01] <lng> .Ajax is failing because of Hash parameter - data: {UserName:UserName,Lang:Lang,AvatarId:AvatarId,Hash:Hash},
[03:05:01] <b-ot> lng, memorised “Ajax”.
[03:05:13] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: It confused me too, I couldn't for the life of me figure out how JavaScript got that smart.
[03:05:13] <lng> Hash is 37ea4e722c82d465eb99b726ea831bed9dc4b2ef26ba6e45953e73080d2a7ffc
[03:05:15] <lng> why?>
[03:05:22] <Haprog> AcademyIntl: well I guess the PHP page is throwing a HTTP error code then
[03:05:46] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: Yes, but AFAIK there's no HTTP error code for "PHP Error" :/
[03:05:58] <fredl> hi guys. I have in a $(document).ready context a $("li").live("click",function() {
[03:06:00] <NodeX> how do I jquery use 1.7.2 on my windows 98 please thanks?
[03:06:03] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: And even if, how do I get the full page data being returned?
[03:06:20] <Haprog> errorThrown is just the textual part of the error given by the server
[03:06:32] <fredl> within that function, I can use 'this' as the LI object the user clicked on, right?
[03:06:35] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: Yeah, but it's only showing the first bit.  I want the "entire" error.
[03:06:42] <AcademyIntl> fredl: yes.
[03:06:43] <Haprog> AcademyIntl: have you checked what the actual result is with Firebug or some other dev tool?
[03:07:09] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: Yup, it's "PHP Error" String (9)
[03:07:17] <Haprog> so that is the whole page output?
[03:07:40] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: According to jQuery, but I know this to not be the case on PHP errors on my server.
[03:07:44] <fredl> hmm. AcademyIntl within the function I use var comp_id = this.getElementsByTagName('DIV')[0].textContent;
[03:07:56] <_torn> does jQuery have an 'outerHTML()' method?
[03:08:06] <varnie> hello
[03:08:26] <Haprog> AcademyIntl: did you actually check the real result of the ajax call with Firebug or similar?
[03:08:28] <AcademyIntl> fredl: Erm... $(this) and this are two different things.
[03:08:29] <NodeX> fredl : yes
[03:08:38] <fredl> AcademyIntl, the getElementsByTagName() shouldnt even see DIV's within *other* li's right?
[03:08:49] <NodeX> $(this) is the element (LI) that was clicked
[03:09:05] <fredl> ok...
[03:09:06] <varnie> how can I force jquery datepicker to give me date in the format "dd M"? the problem is that it give me for example, '19 jule,'. I want to get rid of the comma.
[03:09:09] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: Firebug is not only breaking in the error handler, I cannot see the ajax response.
[03:09:10] <varnie> please help me.
[03:09:25] <AcademyIntl> varnie: The jQuery UI DatePicker has a format option.
[03:09:38] <Haprog> AcademyIntl: use the Net tab of firebug you see all ajax requests
[03:09:39] <varnie> I tried "dd M" but still I have a comma
[03:09:45] <Haprog> and the results
[03:09:47] <Haprog> when they happen
[03:09:51] <varnie> I don't understand how to get rid of it.
[03:10:06] <Haprog> AcademyIntl: first open jquery Net tab and then reload page and trigger the ajax call
[03:10:20] <varnie> I initialize it with the dateFormat: 'dd M'
[03:10:25] <Haprog> then you can expand the ajax request info to view the results
[03:10:32] <Strausser> Q: Whats the jQuery equivalent to elem.offsetLeft..? $elem.offset().left is not the same!
[03:10:54] <NodeX> offset from what ?
[03:10:57] <NodeX> ?offset
[03:10:58] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[03:11:01] <NodeX> ?position
[03:11:02] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[03:11:10] <NodeX> ;)
[03:11:19] <Strausser> NodeX: wthin a LI element within a scrol pane
[03:11:35] <Strausser> not within LI* lol
[03:11:53] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: Yes, this shows the full error page, if not.. a little style-less.
[03:11:54] <NodeX> I - like everyone else don't know your document or layout so it's either to it's parent or the document
[03:12:26] <NodeX> the latter is offset() .. left, the former is position().left
[03:12:27] <fredl> Hrmm...
[03:12:38] <Haprog> AcademyIntl: you can also view it as HTML if the output is HTML
[03:12:38] <Strausser> .position().left returns 0 if its.. in the current view
[03:12:56] <Haprog> there should be a HTML tab below the expanded request line in firebug
[03:13:05] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: Yeah, I clicked "HTML" tab and it's completely different from the format of an actual error page :/
[03:13:12] <Haprog> weird
[03:13:18] <Haprog> maybe it's not valid HTML then?
[03:13:29] <AcademyIntl> Haprog: No, it is.  Just the HTML tab of firebug doesn't seem to render CSS.
[03:13:38] <Haprog> yea maybe
[03:13:45] <Haprog> but atleast you see all the info
[03:13:58] <NodeX> Strausser : that's down to your document
[03:14:16] <NodeX> if you want the true offsetLeft use css('offsetLeft');
[03:14:21] <Strausser> NodeX: I dont really get this stuff. All I want is the LI element's offsetLeft. I can see it in the DOM tree!
[03:14:29] <Strausser> Ah
[03:14:48] <NodeX> saying the offsetLeft is all good and well .. but OFFSET FROM WHAT????
[03:14:54] <Strausser> Wait.. what.. its a css property??
[03:14:58] <NodeX> my house, your house, google.com ???
[03:15:01] <Parhs> hello guys i am new to plugins writing.. where does this refers within  $.fn.tooltip = function( options ) {  }  ??
[03:15:04] <varnie> maybe I should give datepicker some data separator?
[03:16:40] <Strausser> NodeX: As its a scroll pane, its probably the scroll offset or something. All I want is the DOM offsetLeft variable! :D
[03:17:21] <NodeX> omg, the variable is dependant on it's parent
[03:17:33] <NodeX> so (last time) I ask you offset from what
[03:19:36] <Strausser> NodeX: Haha sorry, I dont even know if offset is the right thing (noob). What I want is the position/scroll-offset of an element within a scroll pane. Hope that makes more sense hehe
[03:19:45] <NodeX> no it doesnt
[03:19:51] <NodeX> because I dont know what your scroll-pane is
[03:20:04] <NodeX> let me put it a simpler way
[03:20:28] <NodeX> do you want the offset from the very left of the page or from the inner most left pane of it's parent
[03:20:30] <Strausser> Basically, the whole thing is a slideshow
[03:20:46] <NodeX> the context isn't going to help
[03:21:54] <NodeX> I'm going to guess you want position().left because offset().left is not working for you
[03:22:33] <Strausser> From the inner most left of the pane. To be honest, I'm not even sure if that's correct! cuz I dont even know how this offset/position stuff works
[03:23:20] <NodeX> left of the page = document - offset()
[03:23:28] <NodeX> left of the pane = position()
[03:24:22] <NodeX> if your parent (the pane) has a margin-left of 10em; then offset().left will be 10em + whatever else .. position will be just that - the position away from it's parent
[03:24:27] <vladyn> how can I modify the values of an array? - for example to strip them with .replace(RegEx) and have an modified array ?
[03:24:38] <NodeX> ?map
[03:24:38] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[03:24:39] <Strausser> Ah I think i get it. I thought the pane element had some sort of the scrolled amount of its content
[03:24:41] <vladyn> with the new values
[03:24:55] <NodeX> vladyn : map ^^
[03:25:02] <vladyn> ahh - thanks !
[03:25:08] <vladyn> looking at it now
[03:25:28] <fredl> AcademyIntl, when I have http://pastebin.ca/2172130, how would I get the '1234' on the li click handler using $(this) ?
[03:26:46] <fredl> wouldn't that just be $(this).children().html() ?
[03:27:37] <Strausser> NodeX: How exactly do I select the element to offset FROM? Is it its parent by default?
[03:28:20] <NodeX> you dont
[03:29:01] <NodeX> it's parent is automagically selected by position(); and the document is selected as the parent in offset(); - after some pre-calculations
[03:29:13] <Strausser> Ah
[03:30:16] <Strausser> Hm I'll do some more testing. Thank you for your time! hehe
[03:30:31] <NodeX> nps ;)
[03:32:54] <Whirl3d> Hey all,  has anyone ever heard of or used a web-based screensaver? In other words, has anyone heard of a screensaver app that loads a webpage in fullscreen mode? I figured I would ask if anyone had personal experience with this before consulting the googlesness.
[03:34:12] <GreekFreak> hi all
[03:35:46] <NodeX> Whirl3d : yes
[03:36:00] <GreekFreak> I have a select box that updates another select box on it's onchange event. this is done through an ajax call. When I want to edit the object with these select boxes, and I set the first select box, I then run the onchange event, and set the second select box (now that it has the right items). Unfortunately I can't set the second select. Any ideas?
[03:36:01] <NodeX> but they're annoying, I built one a few years back
[03:36:20] <Whirl3d> What's annoying about them? And thanks for the reply, btw
[03:36:49] <NodeX> they used (certainly a few years ago) alot of resources to bounce stuff round the screen
[03:37:26] <ansolas> @Whirl3d: is it possible to enter fullscreen mode programatically at all?
[03:37:49] <Strausser> HTML5?
[03:38:13] <Whirl3d> Yeah. See I want to be able to use my custom jquery screensaver that I built from scratch as a screensaver. I am helping an artist friend who would like to be able to have her art available as a screensaver and I thought we could skip the step of making a custom app.
[03:38:31] <Whirl3d> custom jquery slideshow....sorry
[03:38:50] <NodeX> that's easy but the "Full screen" part is not
[03:38:50] <daslicht> http://johndyer.name/native-fullscreen-javascript-api-plus-jquery-plugin/
[03:39:02] <daslicht> try this
[03:39:05] <ruby_on_tails> Whirl3d: i recently saw some html5 canvas stuff being used as screensavers on macs
[03:39:06] <bot-t> (192 hours ago) <coldhead> tell ruby_on_tails look what just came through twitter :D https://twitter.com/javascript_news/status/222627951005536257
[03:39:07] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from javascript_news: Glazing ribbon fractals in HTML5 canvas and javascript http://t.co/BkB0WoqC ★ http://bit.ly/OUZzSH
[03:39:48] <daslicht> is there a online demo ?
[03:39:48] <ruby_on_tails> haha jquery bot records stuff cool
[03:40:00] <ruby_on_tails> daslicht: of the screensaver ?
[03:40:03] <Whirl3d> I love that so many people are using thecodeplayer, that's great
[03:40:26] <daslicht> is socialhapy a bot?
[03:41:21] <ruby_on_tails> Whirl3d: you know about thecodeplayer ?
[03:41:26] <ruby_on_tails> knew*
[03:41:43] <Whirl3d> Yeah, you made it, right?
[03:41:55] <Whirl3d> You've shown it off here a couple of times. I love it.
[03:41:58] <ruby_on_tails> aah, ok
[03:42:51] <ruby_on_tails> Whirl3d: http://blog.codepen.io/2012/07/13/codepen-screensavers/
[03:43:15] <GreekFreak> what's the best way to select an item from a select_box. using $('select').val("myVal) or $(option[value="myVal"]).attr("selected", true")? it seems ppl don't agree and saying that one or the other is wrong
[03:43:37] <ruby_on_tails> GreekFreak: use whatever works
[03:45:01] <NodeX> GreekFreak : the selected item or a specific item?
[03:45:15] <GreekFreak> ruby_on_tails, problem is it's not seeming to work either way. I'm updating this second select box using ajax to display it. And when I try try to set it, it doesnt
[03:45:43] <vl1234> gud even to all
[03:45:47] <GreekFreak> NodeX, I want to display the item that was selected when it was saved, so that the user can perform an edit
[03:46:21] <NodeX> I dont understand "when it was saved"
[03:48:39] <GreekFreak> NodeX, the user opens a form, selects an option from select box 1, then I perform an ajax call to populate select box 2. Now when I allow the user to edit this, it displays the select box 1 option correctly (from the DB), I then run an onChange() on select box 1 to repopulate select box 2. and when I try to set select box 2, it won't accept the selected attribute
[03:48:46] <vl1234> i have doubt like...i have 2 input text field and  first text field is enabled and send text field is disabled with the help of $('#secondinputid').attr('disabled','disabled')....in UI point its disabled but by using jquery we can modify,edit and enter the values for disabled field......any 1 know how to control that?
[03:49:10] <vl1234> sorry not send seconf
[03:49:21] <vl1234> second text field
[03:50:10] <vl1234> if any 1 have idea about this..please let me know
[03:53:17] <kai> hi folks
[03:55:18] <NodeX> GreekFreak $("#select-box-2").html('<option>Blah</option>');
[03:56:06] <GreekFreak> NodeX, I'm not following what you did there
[03:56:18] <GreekFreak> NodeX, are you simply populating with one option?
[03:58:11] <GreekFreak> I find that I can't do this: $("#select-1").find('option[value="1"]).attr("selected", true) then $("#select-1").chage() then $("#select-2").find('option[value="2"]).attr("selected", true).... It simply doesn't select the second select box
[04:00:48] <vladyn> is this a valid check if the dom element exist ? $('.someClass') == null
[04:03:57] <kai> I've got a webapp where I allow users to search for stuff in a database. Sometimes, the results of the search will be the input for another form in the webapp
[04:04:32] <Whirl3d> vladyn, var valid=$(".someClass").length===0?false:true;
[04:04:40] <kai> can I somehow use some javascript magic to transfer data from one page to another without having to fiddle with the webapp code?
[04:05:00] <vladyn> great ! - thanks member:identifier:whirl3d
[04:05:06] <vladyn> whirl3d
[04:05:24] <Whirl3d> because jquery will return an empty jquery object rather than undefined when nothing matches the selector, you have to check the length.   np
[04:06:05] <Whirl3d> kai as long as it doesn't violate the sop...
[04:06:13] <Whirl3d> ? sop@ kai
[04:06:13] <bot-t> kai, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin.

[04:09:24] <Narhir> guys... I have to create a website that will help me getting refferals for my MLM network..
[04:09:34] <Narhir> and Im trying to figure out best keyword that I should focus :/
[04:10:15] <Narhir> hm m
[04:10:16] <Narhir> wrong channel :D
[04:25:41] <Zerpex> Hi guys, when I use $ my code doesn't work, but it does when I use jQuery, I get following error: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Window] is not a function
[04:26:13] <Zerpex> I don't use any other libs other than jquery
[04:27:18] <Zerpex> http://pastebin.com/T71su6sT it complains with the error on line 5
[04:35:20] <Strausser> Zerpex: Does '$' work elsewhere?
[04:35:42] <Zerpex> the whole plugins.js delivered with twitter bootstrap works just fine,
[04:38:48] <Strausser> first thing that came to my mind, is if the plugin is not defined like (function($){//code})(jQuery); not sure if it's related tho
[04:39:26] <kai> daslicht: real html pages
[04:39:32] <Zerpex> anyway, I will just do jQuery(function($){//code goes here})
[04:40:19] <kai> Whirl3d: that shouldn't be a problem, the host is the same
[04:40:44] <Strausser> (function($){//plugin code})(jQuery); could be writen (function(jQuery){//code});  But then $ wont work as far as I know
[04:47:59] <cusco_> hi
[04:50:09] <kai> so I guess the actual question is _how_ I change pages in the browser while keeping some of the data around..
[04:55:28] <Strausser> NodeX: FYI, my parent(pane) element didnt have "position:relative" set. Thats why .position().left was incorrect from the beginning :)
[04:58:14] <cusco_> what effect can I use to resize a input type text ?
[04:58:20] <cusco_> so it gets longer
[04:58:28] <cusco_> <-- -->
[04:58:34] <cusco_> <-- --- --- -->
[04:58:36] <cusco_> lol
[04:59:41] <pachet> kai: take a look at history.pushState()
[04:59:47] <Strausser> cant css do it?
[04:59:51] <pachet> ?g mdn history pushstate @ kai

[05:11:07] <mikehaas763> Hi, I've got a simple jquery snippet that simply multiplies two forms fields together (it selects them by id) and puts the result into a third form field. This works when the javascript is on the actual page in <script> tags but not when I include it from a .js file. Any idea why that would be?
[05:13:27] <pachet> mikehaas763: depends on where you place the script reference in the dom
[05:13:40] <pachet> slash a bunch of other possible factors
[05:13:49] <pachet> can you make a fiddle demonstrating your issue?
[05:14:03] <mikehaas763> pachet: In both situations, I put it before the </body>. Yes I'll create a fiddle
[05:14:14] <kelye> is there a way to calculate the offset of an element that has position fixed?
[05:14:23] <kelye> after scrolling, ofc
[05:17:17] <kreantos> hi, is there a way in jquery to autoresize iframes?
[05:17:43] <kreantos> i was looking at the jquery postmessage plugin but this seems to be outdated
[05:19:21] <mikehaas763> pachet: Here is the fiddle, thanks for looking: http://jsfiddle.net/PfX8j/1/
[05:19:34] <kristaps> Hello, does anyone know flash based drag and drop upload?
[05:19:42] <mikehaas763> pachet: and sorry about the long id names they are auto generated by Symfony
[05:22:30] <Strausser> Plupload ftw! Only drag and drop for HTML5 tho
[05:22:40] <wathek> Hi everybody
[05:23:22] <pachet> mikehaas763: herm ... my intuition is that it's an issue with symfony output
[05:23:42] <pachet> no console errors? 404s?
[05:24:33] <misafirkullanici> hi
[05:24:34] <wathek> could you please help me I'm trying to use the resizable function from jquery-ui but I don't understand what's wrong it doesn't let me zoom in and even the zoom out doesn't work correctly here's an example of what I have http://wathek.homelinux.org/wathek/createur/?tid=1&cid=1  try to resize the penguin using the little icon at the bottom left you'll see what happen
[05:24:54] <mikehaas763> pachet: I've triple checked and it's always the same output, so you think it maybe could be just the names it's using for the id?
[05:26:50] <Parhs>  $('ul.plupload_filelist', target)   what does , mean there ?
[05:27:36] <wathek> what's strange is that when I remove containment: "#main" from the resizable options it works well
[05:27:45] <wathek> but I don't want to
[05:27:56] <wathek> be able to resize it to exceed the #main size
[05:30:58] <misafirkullanici> i have a div and this div's opacity is 0. and on hover function i want to animate this div left to right when div's opacity fade to 1. how can i do this?
[05:33:31] <Strausser> Tried to use .animate() on the css "left" porperty?
[05:33:39] <pachet> mikehaas763: possible, try console.log($('#superlonggenerated_id').length)
[05:34:13] <pachet> Parhs: that's the context for the selector
[05:34:35] <pachet> Parhs: 'find all uls with class plupload_filelist in target'
[05:34:39] <Parhs> pachet hm thanks :)
[05:34:53] <Parhs> it could be written in once also i guess
[05:34:58] <Parhs> but not so clean
[05:35:43] <pachet> Parhs: same as doing $(target).find('ul.plupload_filelist')
[05:36:31] <misafirkullanici> Strausser no I want to this actions at the same time.
[05:37:01] <Strausser> You can animate both at once, if thats what you want
[05:37:15] <pachet> $('#foo').animate({opacity : 1, left : 200})
[05:37:34] <Strausser> what he said ^^
[05:37:38] <misafirkullanici> pachet: from 0 to 1 ?
[05:37:51] <misafirkullanici> with fadeTo();
[05:37:59] <pachet> uh, that's the advantage of using .animate
[05:38:07] <pachet> can't animate left with a fadeTo ;[
[05:38:32] <Strausser> fadeTo only does what its name says
[05:40:39] <misafirkullanici> we are talking about dirrent things.
[05:41:25] <Strausser> do you want it to animate to the right AFTER fadeTo has finished?
[05:42:13] <misafirkullanici> when the element is moving left to right at the same time this element must fading to 1 from 0 opacity.
[05:42:49] <misafirkullanici> already i can do that like you say.
[05:43:08] <Strausser> $('#foo').animate({opacity : 0, left : 200}) like pachet said?
[05:43:25] <pachet> :[
[05:43:48] <misafirkullanici> no this is not true usage
[05:43:56] <misafirkullanici> this code is making instant action.
[05:44:11] <pachet> wat
[05:44:11] <b-ot> how do i make a rewrite if the url is exactly something to rewrite it? in web.config
[05:44:23] <Strausser> witout a duration, then yes lol
[05:44:37] <misafirkullanici> i don't want duration
[05:45:05] <pachet> then how in blazes is it 'moving' or 'fading'
[05:45:07] <pachet> gerundives
[05:45:35] <misafirkullanici> i suppose i can't explain this action :)
[05:45:46] <Strausser> must be magic!
[05:45:58] <pachet> it exceeds the capacity of our puny minds to understand it
[05:46:05] <misafirkullanici> perhaps :)
[05:48:01] <ajpiano> he wants to do one and then the other
[05:51:06] <majd> What's the jQuery selector for any input field where the name includes the string date_ ?? e.g. <input type="text" name="date_1" />
[05:51:41] <ajpiano> ?attributeContains
[05:51:42] <bot-t> [attribute*="value"]: Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing the a given substring. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[05:53:03] <majd> ajpiano: beautiful! thanks :)
[05:53:57] <platzhirsch> I use a button to clone a whole form, hence the button is cloned as well. But the cloned button triggers no change, as if the click event is was not registered to the new one
[05:54:37] <pachet> ?.clone() @ platzhirsch
[05:54:38] <bot-t> platzhirsch, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[05:55:03] <pachet> i assume you're just missing that argument
[05:55:26] <platzhirsch> pachet: ah, perfect. Thanks for pointing that out
[05:55:59] <klawd_prime> hi
[05:56:24] <klawd_prime> need some help with the validation plugin: can i validate single fields with it?
[05:56:50] <klawd_prime> i need to know if a single field is valid before i fire an ajax request with its value
[06:04:11] <cusco_> while using .ajax() data: {wizQuestion : this.value}, how can I on success: have this.value ?
[06:08:32] <maxzoil> Hy all
[06:08:47] <Strausser> yo
[06:08:52] <maxzoil> i have image that change when user click on it
[06:09:05] <maxzoil> how i can change the same image again using jquery
[06:09:15] <maxzoil> when user click on it
[06:09:31] <cusco_> isn't that already happening?
[06:10:03] <Strausser> the event is still bound to the element..?
[06:10:07] <maxzoil> http://dpaste.com/772164/
[06:10:12] <maxzoil> yaa
[06:10:25] <maxzoil> even is still bound to the element
[06:10:51] <cusco_> so its still runing the same bit of code: imageTag.attr('src','http://localhost/ci//images/like/unlike.jpg');
[06:11:04] <cusco_> it is re-setting the same image
[06:11:10] <cusco_> right?
[06:11:25] <pachet> cusco_: regarding your ajax question, by taking it out of 'this' and putting scope resolution to work in your success function
[06:11:37] <maxzoil> yes
[06:11:42] <maxzoil> its reseting the image
[06:12:02] <cusco_> maxzoil: add a if() there to set it other if src is already the same ?
[06:12:04] <maxzoil> but unlike_func doesnt work
[06:12:07] <cusco_> ow
[06:12:14] <cusco_> well you either use one or other?
[06:12:22] <keirlav87> how do you create a table out of jquery objects, not using a string?
[06:12:27] <pachet> var foo = this.value; $.ajax({url:'foo.php', data : {wizQuestion : foo}, success : function ( ) { console.log(foo); } })
[06:12:31] <pachet> cusco_^
[06:12:34] <cusco_> pachet: thanks, but how do I declare this, to be used after on the success
[06:12:44] <cusco_> ow
[06:12:58] <cusco_> hmm
[06:13:02] <cusco_> right let me see
[06:13:47] <maxzoil> cusco_:  image source change and every thing
[06:14:05] <maxzoil> cusco_: but unlike function still not working
[06:15:00] <cusco_> maxzoil: can you put that in jsfiddle ?
[06:15:37] <cusco_> does it alert('unlike') ?
[06:17:23] <maxzoil> cusco_:  no,, it give me like alert
[06:17:43] <maxzoil> cusco_:  http://jsfiddle.net/96zTx/
[06:19:48] <cusco_> maxzoil: you need to re assign the event to the element
[06:19:49] <cusco_> 14:12 < Strausser> the event is still bound to the element..?
[06:20:01] <cusco_> (I think)
[06:20:22] <maxzoil> cusco_:  check it working now ,, for like only
[06:20:42] <maxzoil> i already do that  and its working for like
[06:20:43] <cusco_> yes
[06:20:46] <maxzoil>  $('#unlike_click')
[06:21:03] <cusco_> I understand..
[06:21:46] <scathen^C> hey guys, any tips for design, when dealing with the whole can't hover on touchscreens?
[06:22:57] <cusco_> maxzoil: im a newbie myself, but sounds as if changing the id is not enough
[06:23:14] <cusco_> anyway, someone should help you soon...
[06:24:06] <maxzoil> cusco_:  do you any one can help me ?
[06:24:54] <Strausser> Sorry dont have time, but have you tried debugging it in Firebug?
[06:25:15] <cusco_> it changes the id, bet keeps on using the event assigned to the previous id
[06:25:21] <cusco_> but
[06:26:01] <maxzoil> ya
[06:26:12] <maxzoil> but no errors
[06:31:25] <ezio> i've included jquery-ui-1.8.20-custom.min.js ... is there any reason why spinner shouldn't be in there other than it was purposely removed?  if you check the documentation on spinner on the website, it's all gone
[06:34:30] <Strausser> Unless you removed it from your custom build :P
[06:34:47] <ezio> that's the only possibility?  coo
[06:35:10] <Strausser> I dont know really. Never used UI :\
[06:35:40] <ezio> i'm blaming you if this doesn't work
[06:35:50] <pachet> maxzoil: http://jsfiddle.net/bzGRj/
[06:36:04] <Strausser> ;D
[06:36:23] <ezio> nope .. included a full version .. still no spinner method
[06:36:32] <ezio> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'spinner'
[06:37:39] <ezio> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Spinner
[06:37:49] <ezio> something is seriously wrong with the spinner function
[06:37:57] <ezio> it has been abandonned
[06:38:52] <ezio> it's probably suffering from a lot of psychological stress right now because the jequery developers don't ever consider how it feels
[06:39:23] <ajpiano> ezio: spinner isn't part of jquery ui 1.8
[06:39:46] <ezio> AHA!
[06:40:01] <ajpiano> it's ni 1.9
[06:40:29] * geekbuntu dammit imski told me to spin in my chair when i heard the word spinner - now about to fooking fall over
[06:40:57] <Strausser> lol
[06:42:19] <Strausser> where is this spinnin 1.9..?
[06:43:00] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.spinner.js
[06:43:58] <Strausser> Ah
[06:50:25] <mikehaas763> I searched in my jquery reference but couldn't find anything. Is there a jquery utility function to round to say 2 decimal places? Or would it be some standard javascript function?
[06:52:38] <ezio> is there a way to remove an anonymous event handler from an object from within the event handler?
[06:52:59] <Aquaguy> Hey there
[06:53:05] <ezio> $('body').click(function(event){removethisevent();});
[06:53:15] <ezio> anyone know how to do that?
[06:53:22] <Aquaguy> after doing input.blur() shouldn't input lose focus?
[06:53:32] <Aquaguy> It remains focused, (outlined)
[06:54:05] <ezio> where do you want it to focus to?
[06:54:39] <Aquaguy> I don't mind, I want the focUS TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE
[06:54:43] <Aquaguy> sorry for those caps
[06:54:52] <ajpiano> ezio: https://raw.github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/master/entries/spinner.xml
[06:54:53] <ezio> $('body').focus();
[06:55:17] <ezio> nice
[06:56:14] <ezio> ajpiano, it doesn't have a proper blur function but i'm faking it by a click catcher on the div, stop propogation, and a click catcher on the body.  if it reaches the body then i know it has been blurred
[06:56:44] <ezio> is there a way to remove an anonymous event handler from an object from within the event handler?
[06:56:47] <Aquaguy> ezio, I already tried that and didn't work there must be some other funct. focusing the input, Ill check it, thank you for your help
[06:57:29] <ezio> Aquaguy, it's probably the browser
[06:57:35] <ezio> throw up another element
[06:57:38] <ezio> focus that
[06:57:50] <ezio> then you'll at least know if it's the browser
[07:12:57] <ezio> is there a way to remove an anonymous event handler from an object from within the event handler?
[07:13:55] <ajpiano> ezio: you can try arguments.callee but i would recommend just using a named function
[07:17:13] <Strausser> Anyone here familiar with the serialScroll plugin? http://flesler.blogspot.no/2008/02/jqueryserialscroll.html
[07:19:10] <Strausser> nvm figured it out lol
[07:24:01] <twinturbo> hey
[07:24:31] <twinturbo> I have multiple $(window).scroll() bindings. Can one halt the other? IE if one returns false
[07:32:07] <greek> Hi has anyone here implemented jquery ui sortable (with a connected draggable) on a fixed width div so that when more and more elements are dropped into the sortable, the div overflows correctly with a scrollbar? I'm struggling to get the overflow to work. It just stops insert elements after the max width is reached. Any tips would be appreciated.
[07:35:30] <ezio> twinturbo, .stoppropogation
[07:37:00] <pcboy_> Hi guys. I have a tricky question. How can I get the content of a csv from another domain when the page I'm asking is using attachment; file= in their headers?
[07:37:24] <pcboy_> It seems with jsonp it's working. But of course because it's a csv the browser just gives a parse error and I can't access the content in a string.
[07:38:01] <pcboy_> I should add that accessing this csv needs a cookie (yeah I'm basically doing a csrf here).
[07:40:15] <pcboy_> I should also add that I have no problem making the cross domain request. I'm using the jquery.xdomainajax.js plugin. My problem is really getting the content of the csv.
[07:42:49] <pcboy_> Yeah, nevermind. I suppose that's too tricky. I'll just parse the page myself instead of trying to get that csv.
[07:52:56] <some_dude> hey
[07:55:15] <some_dude> I'm doing an animation on mouseover, but every time my mouse goes over the <div> it triggers like 10 mouseover events. since Im doing an animation for the event I only wanna do the animation for the first one.
[07:56:09] <devinceartas> e.stopPropagation() ?
[07:56:51] <some_dude> should I put that in my animation callback function?
[07:57:44] <devinceartas> I'd have to look at code (& can't from here); try it
[07:58:17] <devinceartas> e is the event; make sure the event is passed to function
[07:58:37] <some_dude> nah doesn't work
[07:59:23] <some_dude> $(document).ready(function() {                var i=0;                $('#login').mouseover(function(evt){                                                evt.stopPropagation();                        $('.eventout').text(i);                        var min_offset = 20;                        var x= evt.clientX;                        var y= evt.clientY;                    debugger;            ...
[07:59:24] <some_dude> ...           var randx=$.randomBetween(0,700);                        var randy=$.randomBetween(0,300);                        var x= ((Math.abs(randx-x))>=40)?randx:randx+40;                        var y= ((Math.abs(randy-y))>=40)?randy:randy+40;                                                $('#login').animate({                            'left':x+'px',                           ...
[07:59:26] <some_dude> ...'top':y+'px'                        }, 200);                       i++;                                   });                           });

[08:01:09] <garbagegod> Hey guys, I'm trying to do something along the lines of <div id="foo20"></div> <span onclick="showdiv(20)">Click Here</span> function showdiv(its) { $("#foo"+its).lightbox_me(); } but it's not working, what am I doing wrong besides mixing JS/jQuery?
[08:01:18] <garbagegod> And how should I go about doing that
[08:01:49] <quizme> hi
[08:02:09] <quizme> i'm implementing drag of a div on ipad
[08:02:59] <devinceartas> some_dude: maybe use a global car as a flag. Set it to "animating" when starting animation. Check for that flag & exit if already set. Clear flag when done animating, if appropriate
[08:03:06] <quizme> currently i'm doing this by setting the css left property using jQuery, but i'm wondering if i'm missing any performance gains by not using webkit.transform
[08:03:09] <quizme> anybody know ?
[08:05:35] <some_dude> devinceartas: that could work but it would mean separating the event and the animation. the first event would set the flag, and the animation would reset it. that would also mean I have to transfer event parameters from the event block since they are required for my animation..
[08:06:06] <garbagegod> HALP
[08:07:21] <devinceartas> some_dude: so maybe the global that gets set is an object literal containing needed info?
[08:07:23] <some_dude> or I could trigger a custom event only for the first mouseover event and run the animation in the event handler? maybe?
[08:08:06] <garbagegod> How do I pass a variable from an onclick such as  doSomething(100) to a jquery function?
[08:08:19] <devinceartas> Maybe; still need to distinguish first mouse over
[08:10:11] <some_dude> devinceartas: http://pastebin.com/TtQVC7WD
[08:10:57] <some_dude> devinceartas: it's basically a stupid little prank program that moves your login box around the screeen when you try to log in :)
[08:11:17] <garbagegod> anyoneee?
[08:12:02] <some_dude> garbagegod: you want to pass an event info variable to a handler function? rephrase your question
[08:12:06] <devinceartas> some_dude: cute
[08:12:34] <garbagegod> some_dude: I want to be able to call doSomething(100) in an onclick attribute and have a function that will do something...
[08:12:55] <cusco_> I'm trying to make a input the same size as the div above it
[08:13:03] <cusco_> but size changes from browser to browser
[08:13:05] <cusco_> any ideas?
[08:13:12] <devinceartas> some_dude: might also use a timeout to reset flag variable
[08:13:13] <garbagegod> like function doSomething(x) { $("div"+x).show(); }
[08:13:33] <garbagegod> Do you understand?
[08:13:54] <some_dude> garbagegod: $(element).onclick(function(){ doSomething(100); });
[08:14:18] <garbagegod> some_dude: but it changes
[08:14:34] <garbagegod> I have say, div1 - div100
[08:14:51] <garbagegod> Would I just have to have 100 lines for each .show()?
[08:14:53] <oorks> hi
[08:15:05] <garbagegod> one for each show(), rather?
[08:15:15] <NoiseEee> $('.classThatIsOnYourClickableDivs').on('click',function() { this.show(); });  <-- garbagegod
[08:15:48] <garbagegod> Thanks NoiseEee
[08:15:50] <oorks> I just found this: http://jbdes.net/dev/js/fontsize.html but have no idea of jquery, however I'd like to use this. How do I modify it that it only applies to elements with a specified id or class?
[08:16:01] <some_dude> devinceartas: yea might do that
[08:17:19] <garbagegod> how does it know which div to show though?
[08:18:17] <garbagegod> clicking on one thing shows a different thing, not itself
[08:18:30] <nickasloan> what is the best way to get the index of an element among its siblings when there are other groups of elements on the page that match the same selector?
[08:18:37] <garbagegod> but I have to somehow be able to specify the ID of the div with the number to show
[08:19:41] <some_dude> garbagegod: that depends on your dom structure. you could have a button and have the div next to it show once you click it. (presuming that's what you want)
[08:21:06] <NoiseEee> garbagegod: try console.log(this); in that function and see what it is
[08:21:24] <NoiseEee> nickasloan: http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[08:21:54] <garbagegod> No, I have <span onclick="showDivNumber10">Click to show div number 10</span>
[08:21:57] <dnlmzw> Hey. I have a question regarding an Iframe - I can't get z-index to work. I want it to overlap some content, but it's not working.
[08:22:09] <garbagegod> and then <div id="div10" style="display:none;">Hello world</div>
[08:22:17] <garbagegod> Do you not see what I'm trying to do?
[08:22:38] <garbagegod> where I have many such divs such as div1, div2, div3, etc
[08:22:54] <garbagegod> or actually, onclick="showDivNumber(10)"
[08:23:01] <NoiseEee> garbagegod: yes i see what you're trying to do, my method can do it all, inline JS is a terrible idea.
[08:23:05] <davetarmac> hey guys
[08:23:29] <garbagegod> NoiseEee: so what's the function for that?
[08:23:29] <davetarmac> is there a reason that .append() and .prepend() don't work with html? http://jsfiddle.net/fnyHJ/
[08:23:52] <oorks> I just found this: http://jbdes.net/dev/js/fontsize.html but have no idea of jquery, however I'd like to use this. How do I modify it that it only applies to elements with a specified id or class?
[08:23:59] <dnlmzw> Has anyone ever had problems with frames and z-index?
[08:24:08] <garbagegod> If I have 100 divs I don't want to show all of them if you just want one, I need the showDivNumber(1) to show div 1, and etc
[08:24:35] <garbagegod> dnlmzw: has anyone ever NOT had problems with frames and z-index?
[08:25:20] <dnlmzw> garbagegod hehe. i'm a virgin in that field! but I kinda wish i was a slut, if that metaphor can apply
[08:25:58] <troll-boy> mornin all
[08:26:05] <garbagegod> dnlmzw: ;)
[08:26:06] <HassanS> morning
[08:26:23] <dnlmzw> garbagegod - i'm trying to get an iframe on top of an absolute positioned layer (background) but it wont
[08:26:55] <garbagegod> why would you absolute position a background? and WHY would you use an iframe in the first place?
[08:26:59] <dnlmzw> garbagegod: any good advice? another way you need to wrap your head around it?
[08:27:02] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, this doesn't seem like a "jquery" question, more a CSS one.. however when in doubt fiddle with the display and positioning properties
[08:27:21] <dnlmzw> background: overlay (black transparent background thingy)
[08:27:32] <troll-boy> and garbagegod is right... don't use iframes.  They suck.
[08:27:35] <dnlmzw> iframe - youtube embed player
[08:28:01] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, you totally don't need a iframe for that
[08:28:32] <dnlmzw> no, but it's the easiest way. i don't want to spend time embedding an iframe player.
[08:28:38] <dnlmzw> flash player* sorry
[08:28:42] <troll-boy> ...
[08:28:47] <garbagegod> dnlmzw: you trollin'?
[08:28:47] <ezio> http://206.248.142.234:52170/dust_results?scan_id=1
[08:28:50] <troll-boy> yet you're comfortable wasting our time with this?
[08:28:57] <garbagegod> I THINK HE TROLLIN'
[08:29:01] <dnlmzw> then i have to optimize it for iPad afterwards
[08:29:03] <ezio> can anyone tell me why i'm getting uncaught typeerror
[08:29:06] <troll-boy> garbagegod, that's racist
[08:29:07] <ezio> from the spinners
[08:29:24] <troll-boy> many of us behave well on the internet and merely live under bridges and eat children in our offline hours
[08:29:27] <some_dude> garbagegod:  don't call the onclick function in the html. instead just use jquery $("yourspan identifier").onclick(function() { $('your div').show()});
[08:29:31] <troll-boy> but regardless, I pray you're right
[08:29:34] <Trisox> whooee firefox 14.....
[08:29:47] <troll-boy> some_dude, its just $('stuff').click()
[08:29:53] <garbagegod> some_dude: but, how do I tell it which div is 'your div'?
[08:29:55] <troll-boy> not $('stuff').onclick()
[08:30:00] <oorks> I just found this: http://jbdes.net/dev/js/fontsize.html but have no idea of jquery, however I'd like to use this. How do I modify it that it only applies to elements with a specified id or class?
[08:30:08] <garbagegod> Oh, I guess I just need to repeat that line for every div I need to show
[08:30:28] <some_dude> garbagegod:  where is your <div> in relation to your <span> ? if it's next to it use sibiling selectro, if its under use child selector , etec
[08:30:49] <troll-boy> garbagegod, you should never repeat code, its a sign of something going wrong
[08:31:03] <dnlmzw> garbagegod, troll-boy: i thought there was a simple solution for this that would allow me to use the iframe. but is it even possible to put a z-index on an iframe?
[08:31:32] <troll-boy> oohnoitz, $('.classname').doStuff()  for classes,   $('#idname').doStuff() for id's
[08:31:40] <troll-boy> assuming .doStuff() is your plugin
[08:31:41] <garbagegod> troll-boy: yeah, hence my apprehension to this approach...
[08:32:01] <garbagegod> dnlmzw: uhm, just don't use an iframe?
[08:32:22] <garbagegod> dnlmzw: Just freaking put the embed code where you have your iframe instead?
[08:32:29] <dnlmzw> garbagegod: simple question - is there or is there not a way to use z-index on an iframe.
[08:32:55] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, you're soo far from "the right way" its like asking a doctor how much duct tape to use to seal this abdominal incision you made with a hacksaw.. odds are.. the doctor will not know the proper amount of duct tape.
[08:33:07] <NoiseEee> garbagegod: http://jsfiddle.net/DdzmG/1/
[08:33:10] <garbagegod> dnlmzw: maybe under certain conditions on certain browsers, but you're doing it wrong and unnecessarily complicated
[08:33:49] <garbagegod> NoiseEee: coooool. thank you so much
[08:34:33] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, you want this iframe to popup above content right?
[08:35:48] <davetarmac> Is there a reason that .apprend() and .prepend() don't work in this scenario? http://jsfiddle.net/fnyHJ/
[08:35:50] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, see this.. its like.. a plugin and then 1 line of code:   http://lab.abhinayrathore.com/jquery_youtube/
[08:35:54] <dnlmzw> troll-boy: exactly. but it seems that it's more depending on which line it's put in the code than the z-index.
[08:36:36] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, I just pasted you a way to do it with 2 lines of code (include plugin, call plugin) that doesn't use iframes and does the cool popup thingy
[08:36:53] <garbagegod> popup thingys ftfw
[08:36:53] <davetarmac> I've looked at the api.jquery.com and their example is for <p>Test</p> and that works - I'm just wondering is it because there are no closing tags on the thing I'm trying to .pre/append()?
[08:38:13] <troll-boy> davetarmac, why is there no closing tag?
[08:38:22] <dnlmzw> troll-boy: doesn't use an iframe? haha. oh, so now you're trolling.
[08:38:29] <davetarmac> you'll love this troll-boy
[08:38:49] <davetarmac> I'm trying to wrap two <div>'s in a new div
[08:38:56] <davetarmac> and I blame Magento Go for this!
[08:38:59] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, still racist BUT yeah, quicker than using an iframe, better than using an iframe.  There you go
[08:39:00] <fixxxermet> Hey guys, I'm trying to get an XML document and then parse it, but am doing something wrong.  Code at http://jsfiddle.net/yQUPR/
[08:39:23] <troll-boy> davetarmac, ah magento.. Oh I'm sorry, you wanted your app to make sense...
[08:39:30] <dnlmzw> troll-boy: i don't know if you looked in his code, but he uses an iframe.
[08:39:44] <davetarmac> troll-boy: yeah, it's stupid
[08:39:47] <fixxxermet> You should be able to navigate to the url in thje code to see that it is valid xml
[08:40:03] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, well.. he's dumb for doing so.. but there's your solution.
[08:40:03] <davetarmac> troll-boy: but is there a reason it doesn't work?
[08:40:37] <troll-boy> can you (re) paste your snippet?
[08:42:47] <dnlmzw> troll-boy garbagegod: well, i hope you get somewhere with that stubbornness of yours. thanks for your time, didn't really get anywhere with that, but i appreciate you trying.
[08:44:21] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference
[08:44:27] <troll-boy> still possible to do without an iframe
[08:44:40] <garbagegod> dnlmzw: what exactly are you wanting to accomplish? A youtube video in a lightbox style popup that works on ipad?
[08:45:14] <davetarmac> troll-boy: were you asking me to repaste?
[08:45:35] <troll-boy> davetarmac,  can you (re) paste your snippet?
[08:45:43] <davetarmac> http://jsfiddle.net/fnyHJ/
[08:45:47] <davetarmac> troll-boy: ^
[08:45:56] <troll-boy> and get me a gallon of prop-wash and 20 feet of flight line while you're at it
[08:45:59] <troll-boy> ok reading
[08:46:20] * davetarmac goes to get prop-wash and 20 feet of flight line
[08:46:51] <troll-boy> ah... I see your issue...
[08:47:36] <troll-boy> davetarmac, you got to work with whole dom objects for append() and prepend() to work
[08:48:01] <davetarmac> balzak
[08:48:09] <troll-boy> au moment fixing your code
[08:48:15] <dnlmzw> troll-boy: i'm aware! but come on. it was a simple question and you are trying to teach me what exactly? that building your website in iframes is stupid. i'm aware! but using it for embedding youtube videos with 1 line of code. i don't really see the problem with that. seo? well flash doesn't work quite that well with seo anyway, so what exactly is stupid about iframes. and now you're sending me a javascript youtube api that will add 10 more lines
[08:48:15] <dnlmzw> code when all i wanted was to use z-index on an iframe? gosh.
[08:48:22] <davetarmac> oh, thanks buddy
[08:48:36] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, z-index on an iframe has NOTHING to do with jquery
[08:48:42] <troll-boy> dnlmzw, its a css question
[08:48:46] <davetarmac> I kinda feel bad for not finding the flight line and prop wash now ;)
[08:49:09] <troll-boy> so not only are you asking the doctor about duct tape on the abdominal wound, the doctor you're calling is a doctor of literature
[08:49:14] <fixxxermet> I am also trying http://jsfiddle.net/26xe8/ with paseXML but that isn't working for me either.
[08:50:04] <dnlmzw> troll-boy: you have said that 3 times now but doctors has nothing to do with query. bye!
[08:50:25] <HassanS> out of curiosity why are you trying to keep the code length down?
[08:50:38] <troll-boy> you're right dnlmzw and we're all wrong.  So how's that iframe working for you now?
[08:52:04] <dnlmzw> garbagegod: I'm embedding an iframe for playing youtube videos and i want it over an overlay with a transparent background, but i'm having my difficulties with it. everything i search for on google is returning questions about the opposite, how to get a flash underneath.
[08:52:18] <troll-boy> davetarmac, http://jsfiddle.net/fnyHJ/2/
[08:52:48] <garbagegod> dnlmzw: the issue isn't about the amount of code you have, it's the issue of the depreciated nature of iframes, the unnecessary complexity imparted by embedding a video in the manner you're attempting, and the fact that it would be 10x better to do it the normal way
[08:53:30] <draginx> Is there a way to find out which element I'm hovered over by triggering an event?
[08:53:37] <draginx> like every 10 seconds find out which element I'm hovered over?
[08:54:00] <garbagegod> dnlmzw: why do you insist on using an iframe to save ten lines of space?
[08:54:25] <garbagegod> Why don't you just use prettyPhoto or some other equivalent plugin?
[08:55:23] <dnlmzw> garbagegod: because with the youtube player iframe, i don't have to write another script for replacing it with an html5 player on phones. it does it automatically.
[08:55:30] <davetarmac> oh right
[08:56:07] <davetarmac> so you basically take the div I'm trying to wrap, put the other one down and put the original inside
[08:56:12] <HassanS> draginx http://www.selectorgadget.com/ might help with what you want
[08:56:34] <draginx> no i dont think this is wht i want
[08:56:39] <draginx> basically i want ot know whether or not to hide a menu
[08:56:49] <garbagegod> dnlmzw: so what's the issue?
[08:57:41] <garbagegod> why do you need transparency in the iframe if it's the exact width and height of the video itself?
[08:58:55] <HassanS> draginx sorry I dunno
[08:59:57] <fixxxermet> Could anyone help  me  out with my getting & parsing XML issue?  I've tried http://jsfiddle.net/yQUPR/ and http://jsfiddle.net/26xe8/ and neither produce any result
[09:01:56] <troll-boy> davetarmac, yup pretty much
[09:02:04] <troll-boy> just always think in whole dom
[09:02:12] <troll-boy> don't just start randomly appending html around
[09:02:19] <troll-boy> you *can* do it that way though..
[09:02:25] <troll-boy> lemme show you how
[09:02:34] <davetarmac> troll-boy: expanding on that, is there a way it can be done so that it doesn't matter about the contents of the original divs?
[09:03:01] <troll-boy> davetarmac, while I'm writing the non-dom way, I'm gunna need you to "splain lucy"
[09:04:16] <davetarmac> troll-boy: Basically, I need to wrap two divs in another div because Magento Go is cr4p and won't let you play with html itself
[09:04:28] <dabear> fixxxermet: you cannot do cross site ajax
[09:04:49] <dabear> either use jsonp or a json proxy on your own site
[09:04:55] <fixxxermet> oh, that's what that is then...  So how are ... got it
[09:04:55] <dabear> implemented serverside
[09:05:09] <fixxxermet> Thanks
[09:05:13] <troll-boy> http://jsfiddle.net/fnyHJ/4/ <-- non-dom way
[09:05:30] <jedimind> i like me a little dom in the morning
[09:05:31] <davetarmac> troll-boy: the problem is that the two divs contain almost dynamic content - or more accurately, content that could change
[09:05:55] <troll-boy> davetarmac, content matters not.. class and id do
[09:06:00] <jedimind> content matters
[09:06:07] <jedimind> because he cant hardcode the messaging inside the function
[09:06:16] <jedimind> which is where extruding that view state into a logicless template layer like mustache
[09:06:23] <jedimind> and implementing i18n for localization
[09:06:29] <jedimind> is how to procceed
[09:07:10] <troll-boy> jedimind, true, but he could pull that i18n from an ajax call to something else instead of hard coding it like in my examples
[09:07:42] <jedimind> yeah, ideally, however, that view thing should be extruded into a template of some sorts instead of hardcoding the html structure into the function
[09:07:51] <jedimind> even something simple like microtemplating
[09:07:59] <troll-boy> jedimind, davetarmac's question was how do I grab 2 div's and put then in a 3rd div.. which is satisfied by my demos..
[09:08:02] <jedimind> http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[09:08:08] <jedimind> troll-boy, fair
[09:08:11] <jedimind> i didnt read his question
[09:08:13] <jedimind> im just rambling
[09:08:15] <troll-boy> lol
[09:08:55] <troll-boy> so for all intents and purposes, for his original question, the content doesn't matter
[09:09:25] <draginx> Is there a way to do .is(':hover') anymore?
[09:10:15] <troll-boy> draginx, .hover()  http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[09:10:24] <draginx> troll-boy: not good enough
[09:10:28] <draginx> i need .is(':hover')
[09:10:32] <draginx> basically im doing a heartbeat function
[09:10:48] <draginx> need to see if one of two elements are hovered
[09:10:50] <draginx> every 5 seconds
[09:11:41] <troll-boy> draginx, should I show you how using .hover()?
[09:11:50] <draginx> sure
[09:11:54] <draginx> please no "variable flags"
[09:11:55] <draginx> wont work
[09:12:11] <troll-boy> what do you mean variable flags?
[09:12:35] <draginx> ok lets see ur example
[09:12:45] <draginx> and ill let u know if it works or not :D
[09:13:24] <troll-boy> you mean having a global var called "current_hover" and sticking an id into that on hover, then every 5 sec reading current_hover won't work?
[09:14:02] <draginx> no cause i need to see if one OF TWO elements
[09:14:03] <draginx> are hovered
[09:14:27] <dnlmzw> garbagegod: found out what the problem was. position: relative apparently goes for z-index as well. only thought it had something with the top left, bottom and right parameters to do.
[09:15:26] <troll-boy> draginx, au contraire lemme show you
[09:17:16] <zoned> how do i print out a jquery object as html? example: var $img = $("<img>"); $img.attr("src", "someimg.jpg"); and then something like $img.getHtml() which would print <img src="someimg.jpg" />     is this possible?
[09:18:51] <draginx> zoned: i believe $img[0].outerHTML ?
[09:18:53] <draginx> something like that
[09:19:07] <Anime> $img.html() ?
[09:19:19] <zoned> Anime, that would return a blank string
[09:19:24] <zoned> draginx, let me try
[09:19:42] <Anime> hm, why's that?
[09:21:05] <zoned> draginx, you got it. thanks!
[09:21:37] <draginx> np
[09:22:59] <zoned> Anime, because html() returns innerHTML
[09:23:23] <Anime> ah.
[09:24:35] <Lindrian> Hello
[09:24:45] <Lindrian> This might be the wrong channel but I'll give it a go
[09:24:52] <platzhirsch> What's the best way to select an element from a given? For instsance I have an element with class = "x" and I want to select the first class, from the position of my button, something like: $this()...(".x")
[09:25:20] <Lindrian> I want a very light weight small rich text like editor where i can input text and highlight certain areas of that text, only. nothing else.
[09:25:47] <zoned> platzhirsch, .find
[09:26:19] <platzhirsch> zoned I just noticed I can pass prev() a selector
[09:26:55] <troll-boy> draginx, every 5 seconds read the value of current_div:  http://jsfiddle.net/xUwNn/12/
[09:27:00] <zoned> platzhirsch, that's a bit dangerous, make sure you never add something in the middle there to the markup or else prev() will return the wrong thing :)
[09:27:05] <HassanS> $this~(x) maybe?
[09:27:06] <troll-boy> brb
[09:27:43] <Lindrian> I need to be able to highlight word on a index-basis
[09:27:51] <Lindrian> In other words, position 1-5 for example
[09:27:58] <platzhirsch> zoned:  at least not another element with the same class
[09:28:58] <draginx> troll-boy: i se what ur saying.. ill try that method :)
[09:35:02] <Lindrian> anyone?
[09:35:06] <troll-boy> draginx, much more light weight than the other way
[09:35:17] <Lindrian> or how i can code it myself
[09:42:24] <nicholasschulz> How do I trigger a script by clicking a button? I want clicking 'Escape' to trigger this script $('#viewImage_btnClose').click(function(){ …. });
[09:44:06] <nicholasschulz> oh, never mind.
[09:45:13] <darkfrog> for some reason when I query this: https://gist.github.com/3137317 via AJAX $.post it works fine with every browser except IE.  On IE it says the "topics" array is empty
[09:45:21] <darkfrog> can anyone explain why that might be?
[09:52:09] <voot545> I've seen this kind of a call to convert html entities, but can I pass untrusted code? would it run a script if one existed? var noent = $("<div/>").html(something_with_html_entities).text();
[09:54:31] <jasabella> hi
[09:55:59] <jasabella> if i can achieve the same effect in javascript (e.g. <div id="d" onmouseover... as in css (e.g. #d:hover), where is it preferrable to do it? or should i do it in both?
[09:57:50] <cordoval> i am using backbone but i have to call autogrow plugin https://github.com/jaz303/jquery-grab-bag/blame/master/javascripts/jquery.autogrow-textarea.js , it works as an event but on init or load of that appended html it will show a textarea with a scrollbar until i click
[09:57:56] <cordoval> so on click event and such it works
[09:58:09] <cordoval> but i am trying to call the event after the part of html has loaded
[09:58:12] <cordoval> how to do that?
[10:01:25] <darkfrog> I thought $.get would keep IE from caching the result...it keeps caching the data...how do I make it stop?
[10:02:57] <mablae> hi
[10:03:51] <mablae> does anyone a jq plugin for selecting colors? i need some thing where i could parse in the color values and then put the string in a textfield like datepickers do
[10:04:02] <mablae> +know
[10:04:26] <mablae> I just found these full spektrum selectors like in Photoshop
[10:04:45] <mablae> But I need a color-set definied in database by the product
[10:06:00] <darkfrog> ah, switching to $.post instead of $.get seems to have fixed the problem!
[10:06:48] <Grundell> If i have an list is there a posibility to chose to show the first list item and then display:none on the others and from there have a button which will display the list ?
[10:07:54] <Grundell> Of course o know it's possible to do but al the list items has the same class
[10:12:08] <BFranks> I want to apply http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#multiple-vertical to a column of spans inside <td>s inside <tr>s inside a <table> and attach it to the <div> parent  .. wondering what the syntax would work out to ? "#divid > tableid > span" ?
[10:12:44] <BFranks> no that can't be right.. derp..

[10:19:04] <varnie> good day!
[10:20:03] <nicholasschulz> i have a tiny issue with my page's jquery… i have created this 'photo slideshow'-thingy, and when i press backwards or forwards (both with arrow keys and/or mouse click) a lot of times AND THEN CLOSE (close btn or escape key) AND THEN try to reopen a picture, the script seem to stall sometimes and i have to click on the picture multiple times for it to open… normal? check for yourself http://bannaky.com/blog/
[10:20:27] <varnie> could you help me with .on()?
[10:20:47] <varnie> here's my code and I don't understand why it does not work: http://pastebin.com/yFCrJEa2
[10:21:12] <varnie> is this code correct? (I am about applying .on)
[10:21:38] <varnie> it doesn't work for future added items.
[10:24:57] <Whirl3d> anyone know of a UI cdn that I can use for Jsfiddle, I need the CSS
[10:26:01] <vandunk> Could anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/3vQmV/ I'm trying to stop the top line from losing its underline on rollover.
[10:26:02] <Whirl3d> nvm got it
[10:26:30] <shwaiil> hi
[10:27:23] <shwaiil> Q: Anyone experienced http://slidesjs.com/ ? I'm currently using it, works fine. Unforuntatelly I need to change the nr of elements on the slider, so I need a way to reinitialize it. It's not documented, so I'm not sure if it's possible! Thanks for looking!
[10:27:47] <Kzim> hello, i habe a div $(this) and i want replace it with some html how can i do that plz
[10:28:56] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[10:32:09] <vandunk> shwaiil, at the moment is your 	$(function(){ $('#products').slides({ in your $(document).ready(function() {?
[10:32:20] <vandunk> or whatever your #products is
[10:32:32] <shwaiil> vandunk: thanks for looking! Yes, works fine
[10:32:58] <shwaiil> I 'm right now doing some tests, I'm thinking about just removing all inner elements and then call the initial function again
[10:33:18] <shwaiil> not sure if this is the best way to do it
[10:33:38] <MistuhKurtz> So, I have these instances of jquery Cycle. Each one is sized to "full bleed," so the image takes up the entire width and height of the viewport. The images are sized with "min-width:100%; min-height:100%; width:auto; height:auto;" and it works pretty nicely. Now I'm trying to position the image so that it's cropped evenly on both sides
[10:33:45] <vandunk> i'm just taking a look at it, pretty new at this but i'm sure it should be possible
[10:34:36] <MistuhKurtz> When I try to get the image dimensions with $("img").height(), it returns the dimensions of its container, even though if you inspect the img element you can see that a part of it continues past the container dimensions, and its cropped
[10:35:09] <BFranks> Trying to use sliders in a table: http://jsfiddle.net/JqU7n/  I think I'm lacking some DOM knowledge..?  :(
[10:35:13] <MistuhKurtz> I've been able to get the real image dimensions by creating a new Image() object, though, and doing img.width;
[10:35:44] <vandunk> shwaiil, i would do it the way you suggested, that's all i can think of
[10:35:55] <platzhirsch> Is there a recursive version of prevAll(..)?
[10:36:38] <shwaiil> vandunk: well..it does work.. but i'm wondering if everytime I'm calling this stays in memory
[10:36:43] <shwaiil> or something like that... not sure :T
[10:36:45] <MistuhKurtz> i guess I need to get the real dimensions so I have the aspect ratio, and then measure the container width, apply it to the image, solve for the image height, and then position it based off that?
[10:36:55] <shwaiil> vandunk: but thanks for your time
[10:37:10] <MistuhKurtz> Does anybody have an approach they could suggest? Or does my idea seem best?
[10:38:30] <vandunk> If you're just calling the same function it shouldn't be a problem.
[10:38:40] <jpic> hi all, can anybody confirm that dropping an item on a tab works on http://pub.yourlabs.org/sortable-working.html but not on http://pub.yourlabs.org/sortable-broken.html ? The difference is that .connectedSortable div has no width in sortable-broken.html ... is it a bug ?
[10:39:31] <jpic> (for some reason i can't post on jquery-ui ML) ...
[10:39:54] <vandunk> Can anyone tell me what's wrong with lines 5 and 9 of the javascript here? http://jsfiddle.net/3vQmV/
[10:40:10] <vandunk> I'm trying to always keep the bottom border on the first navitem element
[10:40:36] <vandunk> Sorry, wrong link: http://jsfiddle.net/3vQmV/1/
[10:43:21] <BFranks> Hmmm http://jsfiddle.net/JqU7n/ gives me the error: Cannot call method 'click' of null  which Google says is an issue with the jQuery version.. So I made a local test copy with the latest downloads and no errors, but it also doesn't apply the slider setup function to the spans in the table.. :p
[10:46:29] <rodd> what is 'meter' there?
[10:46:45] <rodd> such a spaghetti, the html
[10:47:26] <BFranks> I was using <meter> .. did I leave a reference ?
[10:47:48] <BFranks> oh wait.. one sec did I use the right URL?
[10:48:11] <BFranks> http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/
[10:48:13] <BFranks> GESH!
[10:49:13] <rodd> BFranks: so which fiddle to look?
[10:49:30] <rodd> the last one has no click events
[10:49:34] <BFranks> http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/ .. the other was some browser cache oddity..
[10:49:55] <BFranks> Before I left <meter> behind.. which should make life a lot better.. ;)
[10:50:09] <BFranks> Yeah .. I'm missing something basic I think?
[10:50:18] <BFranks> Total jQuery noob
[10:52:20] <rodd> BFranks: what are you trying to accomplish?
[10:54:44] <BFranks> rodd: I'd like it to make the % values in the spans a jquery ui slider element that I can work with interactively.. It has to be attached to the parent div though cause the table reloads
[10:55:32] <snover> danheberden: gnarf: 🍰
[10:55:42] <gnarf> yay cake!
[10:57:27] <gnarf> its not the cake
[10:57:32] <gnarf> that or the cake is too late in the topic
[10:57:47] <gnarf> nope
[10:57:50] <gnarf> must be the burger
[10:58:20] <Whirl3d> MistuhKurtz, if you place the image in a an auto-sizing div and get the clientWidth and clientHeight of the div, I believe it will work to get the image dimensions
[10:58:28] <BFranks> rod: This is what I was basing it on : http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#multiple-vertical
[10:59:00] <Whirl3d> sounds like paula deans burger on a doughnut
[10:59:40] <gnarf> aww, lost the heart!
[11:00:09] <MistuhKurtz> Whirl3d, what's clientWidth/clientHeight?
[11:00:30] <Whirl3d> ? clientWidth
[11:00:35] <rodd> BFranks: http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/1/
[11:00:37] <jfisk87> im having an issue with fixed elements on my site when theres a chrome toolbar, like stumbleUpon's
[11:00:40] <Whirl3d> doh! bot-t is out.
[11:00:59] <jfisk87> facebook fixes this by getting the measurement of the toolbar and adjusting accordingly, how do they pull this off? http://cl.ly/image/363w1v2i3L1s
[11:01:15] <Whirl3d> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.clientWidth
[11:01:17] <kborchers> got your heart back gnarf :)
[11:01:37] <jfisk87> typically they re just divs or in stumbleUpons case an iframe
[11:01:50] <gnarf> kborchers: thanks :)
[11:02:02] <BFranks> rodd: Thanks man.. That's better!
[11:02:37] <Whirl3d> jfisk87, what makes you think they adjust accordingly?
[11:02:58] <jfisk87> Whirl3D: they claculate the height if the toolbar
[11:03:10] <Whirl3d> where are they calculating it?
[11:03:52] <Whirl3d> I'm asking because it would seem more logical that they are calculating the viewport height (which excludes toolbars, I assume)  Then they wouldn't knwo the height of the toolbar, just the viewport
[11:04:09] <Whirl3d> but that's just logic, who knows how they really do it, that's why I asked
[11:10:41] <BFranks> So odd.. http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/1/  doesn't remove the # values from the spans, but the demo page I copied it from http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#multiple-vertical does not show the span values.. Almost like another instance of the source code not matching the example code?
[11:12:55] <amirite> jquery ui is naughty
[11:12:59] <amirite> and needs a spanking
[11:13:06] <amirite> who agrees
[11:15:17] <BFranks> Ahhh .empty(). .. Fixed that.. Now to tie it to the parent div.. Progress..
[11:18:35] <BFranks> Still don't have the structure figured out http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/4/ is fine .. but when I try to apply the slider function to the parent object I'm clearly doing it wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/5/
[11:21:00] <jfisk87> Whirl3d:  Iagree but in chrome these arent really toolbars
[11:21:05] <jfisk87> they are elements injected in
[11:26:58] <the_s3b> So people use Jquery for stable behavior across platforms?  Do get that, must I replace ALL javascript commands with jquery commands?
[11:27:08] <the_s3b> s/Do/To
[11:28:37] <saschagehlich> hey all, is there a way to detect who is responsible for a scroll event (user or animation)?
[11:28:54] <saschagehlich> I'm automatically scrolling and I'd like to stop that animation as soon as the user scrolls manually
[11:31:29] <pachet> the_s3b: just the ones susceptible to cross-browser weirdness
[11:32:28] <the_s3b> pachet: how is a newb supposed to know which commands those are?
[11:33:00] <the_s3b> pachet: i'm mainly creating a form dynamically and replacing contents of a textarea...does that have any cross browser weirdness?
[11:33:00] <pachet> good question
[11:33:46] <pachet> depends
[11:34:45] <pachet> do you have any file inputs :[
[11:34:54] <the_s3b> pachet: on what?
[11:35:00] <pachet> in the form
[11:35:11] <pachet> <input type="file" />
[11:35:53] <pachet> saschagehlich: that's a notoriously tricky thing to do
[11:36:08] <platzhirsch> zoned: I ended up using .find() anyway, since prev() or prevAll() do not select recursively :)
[11:36:09] <pachet> best bet is to try and detect incremental scrolls in the direction opposite of the programmatic scroll
[11:36:42] <BFranks> I think I just need DOM help, or a push in the right direction so I can get the syntax right.. I have this fiddle working: http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/4/  .. But I need to bind the slider function to the parent <div id="dynamictable">  and $( '#dynamictable > span' ).each( function() {  didn't work.. :(
[11:40:58] <Whirl3d> BFranks, if I may be Frank, this is the reason you should hire a developer to handle your coding. Because you don't have the fundamentals down, you are always going to be at a terrible disadvantage when trying to fix it yourself.
[11:42:27] <Whirl3d> And, sir, if this were a simple slideshow or form, you could do it no problems. But trying to do these advance UI things is really going to be difficult--for anyone.
[11:42:37] <jedimind> NOT ME
[11:42:38] <jedimind> sorry
[11:42:39] <KWhat_Work> If i extend a widget function _a and the widget has function _b that calls _a, is there a way to have it call the over ridden function like a sane OOP lang or is that just not possible in JS
[11:43:03] <Whirl3d> Especially that crazy funk jedimind  (coughs)
[11:43:21] <jedimind> i heard they have websites on the internet now! it's an exciting time!
[11:43:46] <Whirl3d> dem darn tubes keeping me up at night!
[11:43:49] <rmurphey> KWhat_Work: there is no super, but you can OriginalWidget.prototype._a.call(...)
[11:44:12] <KWhat_Work> rmurphey: so i need to basically copy the object to a new prototype correct ?
[11:44:26] <KWhat_Work> ex: $.widget('ux.tabs', $.ui.tabs, {
[11:44:27] <rmurphey> KWhat_Work: it depends on exactly what you're doing
[11:44:50] <rmurphey> it's likely in that case that you could call $.ui.tabs.prototype._a
[11:45:29] <rmurphey> you would need to call it in the proper context though
[11:45:56] <LindsayMac> Is there a way to animate height to a percentage?
[11:46:29] <KWhat_Work> rmurphey: one sec let me paste some code
[11:47:37] <Ant__> I need noob help, I need to run one function after another, anyone can help?
[11:49:14] <KWhat_Work> rmurphey: http://pastebin.com/gvxtTMAs  So that code basically recurses until the stacks exhausted. Even though the parent calls _processTabs(); my version never gets called...
[11:50:13] <cusco_> how do I run a function (that includes ajax()) every X seconds to pool new info?
[11:50:14] <rmurphey> my jquery ui fu is weak, i would have to dig into it and i can't right this second
[11:52:45] <BFranks> Whirl3d: If you hire a dev you have to teach him your operations, why you want things the way you want, in my case, 6+ months of having the Dev doing various roles, then you get the dev to code the product, start using it, and pay him each time you need to add/customize.. Or you learn and do it yourself. Here I am. ;)
[11:53:20] <KWhat_Work> i think I starting to understand it... You basically need to throw away any concepts of OOP that you have been using to then move to the bastardized JS version of OOP
[11:53:36] <jpic> hi all, can anybody confirm that dropping an item on a tab works on http://pub.yourlabs.org/sortable-working.html but not on http://pub.yourlabs.org/sortable-broken.html ? The difference is that .connectedSortable div has no width in sortable-broken.html ... is it a bug ? can anybody confirm this pls ?
[11:53:40] <rmurphey> KWhat_Work: you basically need to understand protoypal inheritance :)
[11:54:07] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: in jquery ui 1.8 widget factory you have to do what you've done, call the prototype publicly
[11:54:09] <rmurphey> there's nothing inherently wrong or bastardized about it, it is just different from what you're used to in classical inheritance
[11:54:23] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: in 1.9 there is super and superApply methods
[11:54:26] <rmurphey> ah ajpiano i was hoping you'd show up :)
[11:54:36] <KWhat_Work> yah but 1.9 wont be out in my lifetime ;)
[11:54:37] <BFranks> And really I am a fast study I'm just stuck on how to address the parent object in the function .. http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/4/ vs. http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/5/
[11:54:56] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: i sincerely hope you live past the end of the year :p
[11:54:57] <rmurphey> BFranks: what do you mean by the parent object?
[11:55:06] <BFranks> er 'container' ?
[11:55:11] <rmurphey> the container of what?
[11:55:31] <rmurphey> you may want to look into closest() and parent()
[11:55:52] <rmurphey> but i'm not clear what you're trying to do
[11:56:34] <BFranks> The <spans> I want to make 'sliders' are in a <table> in a <div> .. the table is reloaded .. binding to the <spans> by ID like http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/4/ .. won't work after a reload of the table data.. but if I can point to the spans as a child of the div or an object in the div then I can reload the table and they are still bound? .. My terminoligy sucks I know
[11:56:39] <medicineuk> Hi all I was wondering if someone can help me I have a question about laying out javaScript. What's the best way to orginise your functions that are related. Should you hold all your functions that are related to each other inside an object and use dot notation to reference them. Or is it better to have one master function then nest the other function inside that???
[11:57:06] <cusco_> how do I run a function (that includes ajax()) every X seconds to pool new info?
[11:57:42] <rmurphey> cusco_: set a timeout to do the ajax request, and then in the request's sucess handler, set another timeout
[11:57:54] <rmurphey> or better, use websockets and don't poll
[11:57:58] <cusco_> hmm ok
[11:58:10] <cusco_> rmurphey: the service I want to pool does not have websockets
[11:58:22] <cusco_> I actually looked into it
[11:58:34] <cusco_> and I want to set a test server too..
[12:00:02] <rmurphey> BFranks: don't reload the table
[12:00:10] <rmurphey> load the data that you need to populate the table
[12:00:14] <rmurphey> and repopulate the table
[12:00:23] <rmurphey> and update the sliders
[12:01:19] <KWhat_Work> ui tabs suck
[12:01:47] <BFranks> rmurphey: Yes that's clearly ideal .. I could make a better app that way, but it'd take more time and it'd make it harder for others (who only know basic PHP/MySQL) to contribute .. ;(
[12:02:50] <rmurphey> if you are destroying your DOM constantly by re-creating the table, and yet you want the sliders to persist ...
[12:03:01] <danheberden> that seems like a weird reason to make the gap for contribution smaller
[12:03:05] <danheberden> skip ideal for...
[12:03:16] <rmurphey> i'm kinda with Whirl3d, you might wanna work with a developer who knows this stuff :)
[12:03:24] <danheberden> i donno, they could learn and THEN contribute
[12:03:34] <rmurphey> and also, yeah, a dev who can't send JSON from a server ...
[12:03:42] <rmurphey> i don't think i want them contributing
[12:05:21] <BFranks> Yeah I know it's crazy.. making something that isn't totally obfuscated to the point where I'd have total job security.. letting people get hands on with tools they use daily.. crazy. :)
[12:06:04] <rmurphey> BFranks: json is not ... obfuscated
[12:06:09] <rmurphey> it's ... the right way to do this
[12:06:10] <rmurphey> so
[12:06:11] <b-ot> rmurphey, it possible to, you know, fix it?*
[12:06:51] <al_2000> ok so i have a huge list of LIs on a page.. When i click one it expands.. but the problem is that the page scrolls back to the top of the list.. How do i prevent that?
[12:07:27] <BFranks> rmurphey: Correct JSON is used for the AJAX calls.. Sorry .. didn't mean to imply it wasn't.. :)
[12:07:53] <rmurphey> so, BFranks, update the contents of the table, not the table itself, using json data
[12:08:02] <rmurphey> and then your sliders will not go away when you blow away the whole table
[12:08:12] <richardus> hello guys, i'd appreciate some feedback as to whether or not this is possible and the best way to do it as I am a mostly noob to jquery/this stuff.  i'd like to display a page for the user and let them select elements based on clicking and dragging over the page, kinda like Firebug but letting them select multiple elements.  I'd then like to be able to get these selected elements and modify them (add elements, set attributes) and ...
[12:08:18] <richardus> ... submit the modified HTML to a server.  Any pointers?
[12:11:12] <vandunk> Hello, at the moment all the links on my site use $j('a.linkclass').click(function(event){ linkLocation = this.href + '?c=' + colour; ... so eg ?c=blue is added to the url when a link is followed..
[12:11:50] <vandunk> apart from a have a button with <a href = #> which is used to update/refresh the page, how would i add similiar function to that?
[12:12:01] <BFranks> richardus: I did something like that with 'draggable' where the page saves the locations of the elements, but I didn't try applying it to a whole page or try binding objects together so you can drag multiple.
[12:25:08] <BoomerET> I'm trying to find links/tutorials to show me how to use jQuery UI to allow users to select their own theme (internal, no access to Internet per se)
[12:25:31] <BoomerET> Do I want the themeroller widget?
[12:26:19] <freeed> Hey guys.. if I have $('nav a').click(function….  how can I cleanly do something to all the anchors within <nav>? I.e. by default $(this) will only contain the anchor that was clicked.. but i'd like to also do something to all the anchors in the same click event without doing $('nav a').doSomething() .. like maybe a way to grab the original set before it was filtered by the click.. ? any ideas?
[12:27:11] <smearcampaign> Why don't you want to do $('nav a').doSomething()?
[12:27:25] <tash> if I have a button in a <tr> how can I console.log the entire tr on click? console.log ( ( this ) ); logs the button's attributes and what not, but I want the entire tr
[12:27:56] <rmurphey> ?parent @ tash
[12:28:03] <freeed> smearcampaign, i'm trying to clear all the class="active" on the anchors, prior to doing addClass on the one that was clicked..
[12:28:05] <rmurphey> hrm, no bot
[12:28:11] <rmurphey> tash: .parent()
[12:28:15] <rmurphey> also, .closest()
[12:28:39] <tash> thanks rmurphey, I was close .. bug close doesn't cut it
[12:28:41] <tash> going to try
[12:28:49] <medicineuk> Hi all I was wondering if someone can help me I have a question about laying out javaScript. What's the best way to orginise your functions that are related. Should you hold all your functions that are related to each other inside an object and use dot notation to reference them. Or is it better to have one master function then nest the other function inside that???
[12:29:06] <freeed> smearcampaign, so $('nav a').doSomething().click() would just remove the class before any item was clicked..
[12:29:10] <rmurphey> medicineuk: it depends :) but generally objects are going to be a good strategy
[12:29:14] <anjo> hey freeed, you can use $('nav .active').each(function(){$(this).removeClass()});
[12:29:19] <smearcampaign> freeed: ok, so why can't you do $('nav a').removeClass('active) inside the click handler?
[12:29:23] <rmurphey> medicineuk: you may also want to look into the "module pattern"
[12:29:28] <tash> wiat a minute I think I tried .parent()
[12:29:55] <rmurphey> tash: inside an event handler, this is the raw dom element -- if you want to call jquery methods on it, you need to wrap it: $(this).parent()
[12:29:55] <freeed> smearcampaign, there are multiple anchors.. so that would only remove the class from the one that was clicked.
[12:30:00] <smearcampaign> nope
[12:30:05] <smearcampaign> you aren't using this
[12:30:05] <freeed> anjo, that's what I'm trying to avoid
[12:30:21] <rmurphey> you could also do this.parentNode
[12:30:43] <medicineuk> rmurphey: thanks I've been holding them inside objects I'll have a look into module pattern
[12:30:44] <smearcampaign> so $('nav a').click(function () { $('nav a').removeClass('active); });
[12:30:44] <freeed> ohh, smearcampaign that would work, but it's doing another query, which I was trying to avoid
[12:31:03] <smearcampaign> ok
[12:31:21] <smearcampaign> var links =  $('nav a');
[12:31:40] <smearcampaign> links.click(function () { links.removeClass() })
[12:31:59] <smearcampaign> save the collection to a variable.
[12:32:23] <nFFF> are you wanting to remove the class from every link inside nav?
[12:32:28] <nFFF> or just the one thats clicked?
[12:32:47] <smearcampaign> nFFF: he said every link, I believe.
[12:32:47] <freeed> That would work as well… was hoping to find something like $('nav a').click(function(){ originalSet.removeClass();  not sure if that even exists.. similar to .end()
[12:32:59] <smearcampaign> nope
[12:33:13] <nFFF> var links = $('#nav a').click(function(){ link.removeClass('hai'); });
[12:33:34] <freeed> smearcampaign, ok.. storing the links in a var is the best I guess.
[12:33:45] <smearcampaign> nFFF: link inside function needs to be links, but yeah
[12:34:00] <freeed> Thanks smearcampaign  and nFFF
[12:34:15] <nFFF> typo :> just think its more elegant than yours :)
[12:34:26] <smearcampaign> yeah, it's better

[12:42:58] <spersaud> anyone know what rate google crawls a site at ?
[12:43:03] <tash> please ignore the php in this pastebin. When I click on my save button, I want to get the values of start[], end[] and keys[] ... can someone help me with that?
[12:43:06] <spersaud> I am getting really low crawl rates
[12:43:10] <spersaud> 500/day
[12:43:15] <tash> I think .parent() is probably right, just not sure how to get them
[12:43:16] <spersaud> I have thousands of pages ...
[12:43:30] <medicineuk> probably better http://codepen.io/anon/pen/cbdCi
[12:43:31] <BFranks> Can't believe how many hours can be wasted on just finding a small answer .. yesterday I was working with an element inside a div that reloads, asked about it and instantly got help sorting out the parent syntax.. today it's a stale mate of "no, do it all over from scratch"
[12:45:47] <spersaud> BFranks: welcome to the world of web development ...
[12:46:41] <spersaud> BFranks: you dont know how much time I wasted on simple things, takes a while to get a good grasp .. but you should always make things simple and make your life easy .. you end up throwing away all of those things that are complicated because in the end they are not necessary
[12:46:43] <BFranks> Anyways.. If someone can figure out how to reference the 'spans' inside the table, by referring to the parent DIV vs. the actual span classes, I'd be able to keep working, show proof of concept, and perhaps by some time to approach it properly: http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/4/
[12:47:20] <BFranks> sperdaud: In this case I'm actually trying 'too simple' and getting told 'more complicated' is the road forward
[12:47:35] <nFFF> The last 3 questions in this channel have been crazy :D 1) someone wants someone to optimize 50 lines of code, 2) Asking about google crawling site, non jquery specific, 3) talks about a pastebin that hasnt been pasted
[12:48:49] <BFranks> (And I know that I shouldn
[12:49:00] <nFFF> BFranks, what are you trying to do?
[12:49:29] <nFFF> Im confused, you want to select the span elements how?
[12:50:26] <BFranks> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/4/ works.. but it's applying the slider functions to "class='slider'" .. I had this problem earlier with some modal dialogs in the table.. When the table reloads the triggers are lost.. But by referencing the parent <div> it doesn't get lost..
[12:52:00] <pachet> nFFF: tell me if you reach understanding before i do
[12:52:03] <pachet> :[
[12:52:15] <nFFF> :D
[12:52:22] <nFFF> I think you have confused yourself BFranks
[12:52:40] <nFFF> Referncing the parent div is not going to help
[12:53:17] <nFFF> You need to run the slider method on the new tables when they are loaded
[12:53:26] <nFFF> usually within the success callback of your ajax request
[12:54:14] <BFranks> Well if I say "When the span inside the div is clicked do this" it is not lost when the div contents are reloaded, because it's bound to the div.. but if I say to do something when the 'span' is clicked, that is lost when the div contents reload and a new span is put in place..
[12:54:17] <nFFF> Referncing the parent will only help on events, and thats to do with delegation which won't help here, as you need to call your method directly tot eh elements
[12:54:41] <BFranks> oh
[12:54:57] <nFFF> There is no click event in your code matey :<
[12:55:16] <nFFF> ?delegation
[12:55:16] <kvnn> I'm using a jquerypp "default" events amd module to create an event. For some reason, when I do $('div').myEvent(   code    ), the $(this) in 'code' refers to the event rather than the element that I'm calling the method on. I'm new to this, and would appreciate any advice. Custom event method: http://pastebin.com/jHfpCbV6
[12:55:21] <codepython777> I've a white PNG image. I would like to change its color to borrow from another element that is a text button. Can this be done using jquery?
[12:55:37] <BFranks> Yeah I was getting stumped between what'd I been doing last night (with a click event) and applying the slider funtion to the spans.. ;p
[12:55:39] <nFFF> codepython777 it can be done using jquery and canvas
[12:56:11] <rmurphey> BFranks: as i said before, if you're blowing away the whole table, those sliders aren't going to stick around
[12:56:34] <codepython777> nFFF: so canvas can change the color of an image pixel by pixel?
[12:56:40] <BFranks> Okay the light's starting to come on.. I'm learning.. so slow.. but getting there
[12:57:06] <nFFF> codepython777, basically you draw your png image to the canvas, at this point its no longer your png, and is actually painted on the canvas pixel by pixel
[12:57:13] <nFFF> canvas has a imageData method
[12:57:23] <nFFF> which returns an object with property .data
[12:57:31] <nFFF> which returns the rgba value for every pixel
[12:57:36] <nFFF> in an array
[12:57:53] <rmurphey> BFranks: and this is why i suggested back then that you not blow away the whole table, but rather that you update the pieces you need to update
[12:58:05] <nFFF> x,y starting at 0,0 => to the last pixels of your image
[12:58:22] <BFranks> codepython777: I wouldn't use a white image, if you want a solid color or a gradient use CSS (os SVG) and make changes to the CSS with JS? (But I'm the rookie on here)
[12:58:28] <nFFF> I think you can write to imagedata to change the rgba value of each pixel
[12:58:29] <BFranks> os=or
[12:58:30] <codepython777> nFFF: I essentially have a logo that i want to flip in color depending on the theme
[12:58:44] <nFFF> css sprites?
[12:58:51] <codepython777> nFFF: never heard of them
[12:58:51] <BFranks> rmurphey: Yeah but that means a whole new approach.. :(
[12:58:53] <nFFF> would be the easiest way
[12:59:00] <nFFF> codepython777 google ? :)
[12:59:04] <codepython777> reading now
[12:59:09] <rmurphey> BFranks: you're not going to get very far with your current approach
[12:59:12] <rmurphey> so
[12:59:12] <b-ot> rmurphey, it possible to, you know, fix it?*
[12:59:45] <nFFF> its basically both your logos on one image, and use css to show part of the image, using background-position: x y;
[12:59:59] <BFranks> I better eat some food and consider kicking it up a notch.. sorta hate to make things too complex but it sounds justified here..
[13:00:22] <codepython777> nFFF: I could just check the color and load one of two images, isnt it? That would be easier?
[13:00:44] <codepython777> That would keep the contrast, either white or black ? :)
[13:00:55] <nFFF> codepython777, theres many ways
[13:01:00] <codepython777> cool. thanks
[13:01:06] <nFFF> css sprites just save on http requests :D
[13:01:32] <nFFF> BFranks, how are you loading the new table?
[13:03:43] <BFranks> nFFF: there's an input on the page with a value in secs, it takes that, *100, and then uses that as part of a refresh function via AJAX to MySQL to snoop a transaction log table.. if the last entry in there is newer than the page data it grabs the table using parameters on the page (mor input elements) using anothe AJAX -> PHP -> MySQL call..
[13:05:26] <nFFF> ok so in your AJAX request
[13:05:40] <nFFF> in the success callback throw your slider method
[13:05:52] <nFFF> and your problem is solved
[13:06:49] <rmurphey> if you don't mind re-creating your sliders every time the ajax request runs ...
[13:06:52] <BFranks> nFFF: Yep, that finally became clear (and it's what I do for the table.sortable, but all this talk of do-overs has me on the fence.. So I'll debate it over lunch.
[13:07:00] <kvnn> I'm using a jquerypp "default" events amd module to create an event. For some reason, when I do $('div').myEvent(   code    ), the $(this) in 'code' refers to the event rather than the element that I'm calling the method on. I'm new to this, and would appreciate any advice. Custom event method: http://pastebin.com/jHfpCbV6
[13:07:19] <danheberden> lol at "jquery pee pee"
[13:07:30] <BFranks> rmurphey: It actually doesn't redraw the table unless there's a data change outside the page.. ;)
[13:08:17] <danheberden> kvnn: so $('div').on('click', function(){ /* this is not the div????? */ });  ???
[13:08:50] <danheberden> what line are you even talking about?
[13:09:13] <kvnn> danheberden: for my custom event, called clickheld, $(this) would not be the div.
[13:09:35] <danheberden> that's a method on the prototype, not a custom event
[13:09:49] <Afacka> Does anyone have any experience with Paul  Irish's infnite scroll?
[13:10:06] <danheberden> this would be an array of divs
[13:10:07] <Woet> Afacka: just ask your question..
[13:10:14] <kvnn> danheberden : You're right - I've been confused
[13:10:28] <danheberden> kvnn: and now you know, so all better! :D
[13:11:27] <kvnn> danheberden: So, when creating a custom method, do I need to specify what $(this) should refer to when the method is attached to a DOM element?
[13:11:52] <Afacka> Well I am using a small script to replace an image if it is inside a specific class. Ex: If image is inside "highres" class the image source will be replaced with highres. It works fine, except when new posts are called in with Infinite scroll, they are not changed by the script
[13:12:19] <danheberden> kvnn: this, in that method, is already a jQ object
[13:12:41] <danheberden> all you're doing is getting a collection of dom nodes and calling your function
[13:12:48] <danheberden> so `this` is $('div')
[13:12:51] <danheberden> in your example above
[13:13:20] <danheberden> and then you would do if ( this.length < 1 ) { return this; } this.each(...
[13:15:29] <nFFF> if ( this.length < 1 ) { return 'Your selector is invalid you fucking idiot'; } :D
[13:15:43] <rmurphey> Afacka: you'll need to continue to do it as posts are loaded
[13:16:05] <Afacka> remurphey: Could you explain how to do that?
[13:16:05] <rmurphey> the code that's replacing the images only operates on the images that are on the page when the code executes
[13:16:07] <kvnn> danheberden: sorry, I'm trying to follow along. So, when I do $('#mine').clickheld(function(){   console.log( $(this) ) }), how can I get $(this) to be $('#mine')? Currently it is [event]
[13:16:17] <rmurphey> Afacka: i have no idea, i'm not familiar with the details of infinite scroll
[13:16:30] <Afacka> rmuphey: I placed it inside the inf. scroll callback
[13:16:31] <rmurphey> it's possible that it announces an event when it loads more content
[13:17:03] <rmurphey> Afacka: if you're running the code in the callback, it "should" work -- can you show your code?
[13:17:18] <Afacka> Yep. One sec.
[13:17:22] <rmurphey> again, i'm not familiar with infinite scroll in particular ... have you verified the callback is firing when you think it is?
[13:17:38] <danheberden> kvnn: if you're passing a callback to oeprate on, you need to call that callback
[13:17:51] <the_s3b> what types of commands typically have cross browser issues?....(i just want to dynamically create a form and change data in a text field...should i be worried?)
[13:18:01] <rmurphey> the_s3b: try it an dsee
[13:18:20] <rmurphey> there's not really a straightforward answer to your question
[13:18:48] <danheberden> kvnn and if you need to assign the context to the function, use .call or .apply
[13:19:14] <danheberden> callback.apply( theThisYouWantToSet, arrayOfArguments )
[13:19:24] <danheberden> which would be inside of your clickheld function
[13:20:00] <Afacka> rmurphey: http://jsfiddle.net/ysFFR/1/
[13:20:12] <rmurphey> Afacka: have you verified that the callback is firing when you think it is?
[13:20:17] <KWhat_Work> Anyone know of a tab library addon that works and is useful ?
[13:20:29] <nFFF> kvnn, some fo your code looks wierd
[13:20:38] <rmurphey> Afacka: you probably don't want to put it in a document raedy block
[13:20:50] <rmurphey> er, wrapper
[13:21:42] <Afacka> rmurphey: Oh sorry that is not suppose to be there, I forgot to take that out when I placed it in. I was naming the function and then just using the callback within the code
[13:21:53] <Whirl3d> the_s3b, one of the things that makes jQuery so great is that it standardizes things across browsers so you write your code once and jquery handles changing it to meet the requirements of the browser where necessary. So, NO, you don't have to worry.
[13:22:32] <the_s3b> Whirl3d: but to be 100% safe jquery would need to wrap EVERY javascript function with its own safe commands no?
[13:22:43] <Whirl3d> no
[13:23:02] <rmurphey> Afacka: try http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/n5rJR/2/
[13:23:04] <the_s3b> Whirl3d: if no then that means there *ARE* some commands that are inherently safe....is there a web page that lists those commands?
[13:23:14] <rmurphey> the_s3b: no
[13:23:18] <rmurphey> just. try. it.
[13:23:23] <Whirl3d> Have you looked?
[13:23:26] <the_s3b> Whirl3d: no
[13:24:01] <rmurphey> the_s3b: there is absolutely zero way that anyone here can anticipate the problems you might run into
[13:24:08] <rmurphey> try it. let us know what problems you run into.
[13:24:15] <Whirl3d> the_s3b, go check out google and see if they can answer your question. You are kind of being foolish if you think that your use case is going to be the one that breaks jQuery.
[13:24:29] <the_s3b> rmurphey: aren't you suggesting everyone write their code twice...once in plain JS and once in Jquery and then test on all browsers to find gotchas?
[13:24:41] <NoiseEee> obv troll is obv
[13:24:47] <rmurphey> the_s3b: for god's sake
[13:24:47] <rmurphey> no
[13:24:56] <rmurphey> i'm suggesting that you TRY TO DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT TO DO
[13:25:13] <rmurphey> do it with jquery, do it with plain js, whatever
[13:25:43] <rmurphey> and am i suggesting that you test on all browsers? yes. test on all browsers that you expect your code to work on.
[13:25:49] <Whirl3d> have you heard of prototype? try them. Actually, jquery will break for sure. Use another framework and get support in thier channel.
[13:28:15] <the_s3b> ok i'll just write everything in jquery to be safe.. i'll first look for a jquery command for each thing i want to do ...if i can't find it i will use JS..thanks
[13:30:44] <juha_> bot-t is b-ot ?
[13:31:02] <nicholasschulz> when i click next/previous multiple times and then close and try to reopen a picture, it seems that the jquery is overloaded and don't work… after some time it works again or if i reload the page it works immediately.. any ideas? http://bannaky.com/blog/
[13:31:10] <juha_> nope, chuck testa
[13:36:01] <LindsayMac> Does anyone here have a favorite light weight scroll bar plugin to refer me to? Theres a bunch otu there but figured i would get input/suggestions. I want to be able to simply add my own image / styles
[13:36:19] <Afacka> rmurphey: Thanks, but that's not working, mind if I message you?
[13:37:09] <LindsayMac> p.s. I will have multiple scrollable divs on a single page
[13:37:22] <FernandoBasso> $("input:radio[name=radioIdProfessor]:checked").val(); <-- It is always getting a value, even when no radion button was checked. Any ideas?
[13:38:16] <aniasis> jquery ui is injecting these aria elements into my markup why and how do I disabled?
[13:38:47] <tw2113> aria stuff is good though, accessibility stuff
[13:39:28] <rmurphey> Afacka: please do not message me
[13:40:36] <Afacka> rmurphey: ok sorry, the solution only works for page 1 and doesnt affect page 2 as well. Should i be using function(arrayOfNewElems){
[13:41:03] <rmurphey> Afacka: i'm simply not familiar enough with infinite scroll to tell you what to do
[13:41:04] <shoky> FernandoBasso: jsfiddle it
[13:41:10] <rmurphey> verify that the callback is firign when you expect
[13:41:16] <rmurphey> verify that you're selecting the elements you expect
[13:41:25] <juha_> where is bot-t when i need it :(
[13:41:30] <rmurphey> figure out the simplest possible thing that still breaks :)
[13:41:39] <Afacka> rmurphey: how would I verify that the callback is firing?
[13:41:41] <Whirl3d> shoky! wasssup?
[13:41:47] <rmurphey> Afacka: console.log('anything')
[13:42:05] <Afacka> rmurphey: okay thanks ill try
[13:42:31] <shoky> whirly: okz, besides my sleep hours being fucked (upside down). sups
[13:42:31] <FernandoBasso> shoky: Those radio value com from the database.
[13:42:40] <shoky> FernandoBasso: so?
[13:43:29] <FernandoBasso> So even if I jsfidle it, it won't work...
[13:43:37] <shoky> FernandoBasso: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/kCHZa/
[13:43:37] <danzik171> rmurphey: just curious, i think you've been asked this, but would u ever run that writing testable js course as a webcast?
[13:45:22] <FernandoBasso> $("input:radio[name=radioIdProfessor]:checked").val() <-- That is what I have, but it always has a value...
[13:46:23] <shoky> FernandoBasso it works in the fiddle
[13:46:25] <rmurphey> danzik171: if i could find quality software to do it with
[13:47:01] <aniasis> does anyone know how to disable jquery mobile hijacking my inputs?
[13:47:24] <rmurphey> danzik171: there's also the qeustion of how much people would pay for an online version
[13:50:40] <danzik171> rmurphey: certainly cant guarantee anything without asking higher ups of course, but ill bet my dept would be interested ( 30+ possibly ).  guess ill keep a look out to see if anything happens
[13:51:00] <rmurphey> danzik171: i think we'd be highly disinclined to try to teach 30 people at a time :)
[13:51:07] <rmurphey> but perhaps in an online format i'd feel differently
[13:51:14] <rmurphey> we keep our in-person classes at ~12-15
[13:51:40] <rmurphey> danzik171: for that many people, why not do something on-site?
[13:51:50] <Afacka> rmpurphey: console.log('anything') says undefined
[13:53:56] <shoky> Afacka: it's not saying 'anything' as well?  undefined is what console.log returns
[13:54:48] <Afacka> I went to (in chrome) view > developer > javascript console and put console.log('anything'). It returned undefined but nothing else shows up so yes
[13:55:31] <shoky> it doesn't say anything on the line above 'undefined'  ..?
[13:56:35] <Afacka> <shoky> it says failed to load 3 times besides that nothing
[13:58:29] <shoky> Afacka: that sounds pretty dubious
[13:59:06] <loincloth> is there a MediaElement.js room on freenode or anywhere?
[13:59:11] <loincloth> anybody know?
[13:59:31] <Afacka> shoky: ill try firefox
[14:00:04] <shoky> Afacka: is this happening only on a specific page? or on any page?
[14:01:13] <Afacka> shoky: it works fine on firefox. i don't really see anything in the console on any page on chrome
[14:02:11] <shoky> you go to www.google.com, go to the console, type console.log('foo') , and it doesn't say foo anywhere?
[14:03:15] <Afacka> It returned foo on the 2nd line and undefined on the 3rd line
[14:03:21] <shoky> ..
[14:03:28] <shoky> what doesnt work again? :)
[14:04:11] <Afacka> i dont see anything besides that in chrome when I see stuff in firefox
[14:04:21] <shoky> if you see foo
[14:04:25] <shoky> then console.log is working fine
[14:06:02] <shoky> why dont you explain your problem properly?
[14:06:23] <shoky> "i see stuff in firefox" is great and all, but ..
[14:07:08] <Afacka> Sorry, In Chrome, all i see is errors on a certain site. Visiting that same site on FireFox shows stuff like GET imagelinkhere
[14:07:49] <shoky> does the site work differently?
[14:07:59] <Afacka> no
[14:08:07] <shoky> what's the problem again..?
[14:08:41] <Afacka> My main problem problem actually is not this, I had a problem with infinite scroll and someone told me to check the console
[14:08:50] <shoky> and we just concluded that console is working fine
[14:08:53] <shoky> you can move on
[14:09:04] <Tomashe> hey guys

[14:09:21] <Tomashe> its undifined
[14:09:32] <shoky> ?eror

[14:09:50] <Tomashe> is the correct the way i do it
[14:09:51] <Tomashe> ?
[14:10:17] <shoky> Tomashe: put in the line before:  next_image = undefined;
[14:10:20] <nFFF> Tomashe, that should work
[14:10:31] <Afacka> NoiseEee: I was told to check for a callback in the console, how would I do that ?

[14:12:47] <Afacka> Yes< I am unsure how to log it to my console
[14:13:00] <nFFF> Tomashe, by reading some basic tutorials on javascript :D
[14:13:10] <shoky> Afacka: http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:13:16] <nFFF> if you don't know how to log to console its probably time to read
[14:13:22] <nFFF> and not to code
[14:13:38] <Afacka> no i code anyway
[14:13:46] <Afacka> lol jk ill check that link. thanks shoky
[14:13:50] <nFFF> :D
[14:13:55] <shoky> hh..
[14:14:16] <Afacka> i code national security
[14:14:20] <Afacka> yes?
[14:14:34] <shoky> i feel safe
[14:14:49] <Afacka> .firewall(terrorists, bombs, shoky)
[14:15:07] <shoky> that'll come in handy, thx!
[14:15:13] <Tomashe> ok thanks guys
[14:17:07] <Afacka> so i have to put the console logger in my code?
[14:19:26] <Afacka> shoky:
[14:20:22] <Afacka> Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
[14:20:45] <shoky> did you really just say that
[14:21:21] <Afacka> i mean if you think about it
[14:21:46] <shoky> gotcha
[14:22:15] <Afacka> shoky can i message you?
[14:22:27] <shoky> you are doing that already
[14:22:30] <shoky> it is working out fine
[14:22:49] <Afacka> okay thanks shoky
[14:33:14] <Afacka> Sorry, i'm a little confused about jquery, does it include the use of firewalls?
[14:33:43] <shoky> in response to your previous question: yes, you can get banned from #jquery
[14:34:08] <shoky> thanks to the irc firewalls
[14:34:25] <Afacka> sorry ill try #firewalls
[14:34:40] <MistuhKurtz> I'm having a problem where I'm measuring $(window).width(); and sometimes it fails to account for the scroll bar
[14:36:50] <Whirl3d> MistuhKurtz, as you prbably have gathered, a lot of folks have that problem, I just design my sites as if there is one regardless
[14:37:20] <MistuhKurtz> yeah forcing the overflow-y:scroll; takes care of it
[14:37:29] <MistuhKurtz> but I'd like to figure out if something else works...
[14:40:03] <BFranks> Hmmm http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#multiple-vertical shows the use of "range: 'min'" on the vertical sliders .. but there's not one example of it applied to a normal horizontal slider.. and I can't seem to make it work?
[14:40:03] <MistuhKurtz> the designers at my agency are on this big kick for "full-bleed" images that span the entire width/height of the window
[14:40:14] <MistuhKurtz> biggest headache ever >.<
[14:40:36] <Tomashe> i want to search for a style but i recive 2 results there is a way to tell my search to look only for 1: $(".TOOLRT a[style$='font-size:19px; color:#000']");
[14:40:42] <Tomashe> this recive me 2
[14:40:50] <MistuhKurtz> background-size would be perfect, but animating it looks horrible in chrome, and webkit has a rendering bug where sometimes a 1px gap shows
[14:42:40] <RuslanPopov> re all
[14:42:41] <tds5016> hi.
[14:42:58] <RuslanPopov> ppl, I have got ajax's response with html, then I need to change placeholders with JS and show changed response on a page
[14:43:03] <RuslanPopov> but strings are immutable in JS and I can't to understand what to do
[14:43:04] <rethus> may i catch with jquery if prototype complete a ajax-call?
[14:43:16] <tds5016> is there a way to do something like var test = document.createElement('div'); document.body.appendChild(test); test.draggable();
[14:43:17] <tds5016> ?
[14:43:18] <RuslanPopov> http://dpaste.com/772393/ - any advices?
[14:43:31] <tds5016> so basically I want to access an object that I have a reference to with query.
[14:43:38] <tds5016> that I don't have an id on.
[14:43:41] <tds5016> is there a way to do this?
[14:44:25] <supergiantrobot_> I am having a problem with .ajaxComplete() and Rails
[14:44:38] <supergiantrobot_> I register a handler, but it never gets called.
[14:44:40] <MistuhKurtz> weird. Whirl3d, $(window).innerWidth(); sizes correctly
[14:44:55] <MistuhKurtz> but the jquery docs says the window object is not supported for that method
[14:44:55] <shoky> tds5016: $(test).draggable()
[14:45:11] <tds5016> oh, it'll let me access an object that way?
[14:45:12] <tds5016> awesome!
[14:45:21] <rethus> how can i catch a mousemove on the whole page? asign it to ybody ?
[14:45:26] <shoky> it'll wrap that element into a jq object
[14:45:36] <shoky> or smth
[14:45:40] <tds5016> didn't work :-(
[14:45:44] <supergiantrobot_> i want to know when an ajax request has completed
[14:45:57] <supergiantrobot_> but none of the events seem to be firing
[14:46:09] <MistuhKurtz> er, worked in Chrome. Same result in Firefox >.<
[14:46:10] <tds5016> $(slide.filmStrip).draggable();
[14:46:13] <tds5016> am I doing that correctly?
[14:46:20] <shoky> who knows
[14:46:29] <tds5016> shoky: heh, there is that :-)
[14:46:46] <tds5016> this.filmStrip.insertBefore(slide.filmStrip, this.filmStrip.firstChild);     $(slide.filmStrip).draggable();
[14:47:04] <tds5016> that's the complete logic after having added it to the dom.
[14:48:22] <tds5016> shoky: does that make any sense what I'm trying to do?
[14:48:24] <rethus> $("body").mousemove(function(event) { this didn't work.. why
[14:48:32] <rethus> schould catch all mousemove on the page
[14:49:41] <jedimind> try body,html
[14:49:50] <jedimind> $('body,html')
[14:49:53] <rethus> in quotes?
[14:50:10] <shoky> tds5016: i donno, what's slide.filmStrip
[14:50:30] <tds5016> it's a div.
[14:51:06] <[fields]> this is day 2 I have been seeing this consistently. $('#theBody #loginForm #subm').click(function() { if($('#email').val()==”){ alert('You must provide a Username'); } }); // this alert pops twice every time it (or any, occur) and I haven't the foggiest idea why. Any ideas?
[14:51:33] <shoky> tds5016 then it should work.. but i cant really know if your code makes sense without seeing it
[14:51:52] <tds5016> okay, also, copying the javascript over to right place....
[14:51:57] <tds5016> that makes one hell of a difference :-)
[14:52:00] <tds5016> :-P
[14:52:03] <tds5016> Thanks of rate help!!!!!
[14:52:06] <shoky> tds5016 does your console  say anything?
[14:52:09] <tds5016> for the help*
[14:52:17] <shoky> did you include jqui..
[14:52:33] <tds5016> it looks like it did work; I'm just a complete idiot.
[14:52:34] <tds5016> haha.
[14:52:42] <shoky> h
[14:53:02] <tds5016> now if only there were a way to make a copy of an object that you could drop to a div.
[14:53:18] <rethus> jedimind http://jsfiddle.net/KRyEX/1/
[14:53:25] <rethus> doesn't work
[14:53:41] <shoky> rethus what about including jquery
[14:54:11] <RuslanPopov> ppl, how to change some inputs inside html before prepending it into div?
[14:54:13] <jedimind> rethus, sure it does
[14:54:14] <jedimind> http://jsfiddle.net/KRyEX/1/
[14:54:35] <shoky> same link :P
[14:54:47] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/KRyEX/3/
[14:54:58] <jedimind> yeah that
[14:55:02] <jedimind> shush :)
[14:55:09] <rethus> k, should work, i try it in my code
[14:57:52] <shoky> [fields]: you must be setting that click handler twice
[14:58:32] <[fields]> shoky: <input type="button" name="subm" id="subm" value="Next" data-icon="arrow-r" data-iconpos="right" />
[14:58:46] <shoky> ?
[14:58:49] <RuslanPopov> ppl, how to change some inputs inside html before prepending it into div?
[14:58:50] <[fields]> shoky: $('#theBody #loginForm #subm').click(function() {  /* */ });
[14:59:07] <[fields]> shoky:  I see that as only once
[14:59:13] <[fields]> am I missing something?
[14:59:19] <shoky> [fields] is that your entire code..
[14:59:30] <shoky> obviously it's not
[14:59:40] <shoky> use a pastebin
[14:59:43] <shoky> or jsfiddle
[14:59:47] <[fields]> ok
[15:01:13] <shoky> RuslanPopov: var elements = $(someHtml); /* do stuff with elements */;  elements.prependTo('#someDiv')
[15:03:45] <[fields]> http://pastebin.com/xcLwErMV
[15:05:12] <[fields]> sorry, http://pastebin.com/FLkbVfRu
[15:05:51] <[fields]> line 127 (or 127-133)  is the code which produces the problematic behavior and I've put comments there on what that behavior is.
[15:06:20] <BFranks> Hmmm so much to learn.. I'm curious how to get the value of a slider after it's changed.. http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/9/  .. clearly isn't the best approach, especially since you might mouseup outside of the slider element.. ;p
[15:07:16] <rmurphey> BFranks: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider
[15:07:19] <rmurphey> see events
[15:07:22] <shoky> [fields] you're certain that querySuccessCB is only called once?
[15:07:42] <rmurphey> specifically the change event
[15:08:29] <derekpioneer> i can't get animate() to give me any response: http://jsfiddle.net/nAeCp/2/
[15:08:52] <rethus> would this work to check, if a div is defined? if( $('#countEinheit')!='undefined'){
[15:09:12] <[fields]> shoky:  ahh I see.  but that still doesn't explain why $(#theBody #loginForm #subm').click(function() { ... is called twice, unless I've created a double instance of querySuccessCB
[15:09:27] <shoky> [fields] a double instance?
[15:09:55] <[fields]> maybe i addressed the concept by a poor name
[15:10:53] <shoky> what concept
[15:11:02] <rmurphey> rethus: you have probably discovered that it does not work
[15:11:08] <rmurphey> you can check the .length of a selection
[15:11:25] <[fields]> shoky: why 1 click which should call alert once, produces the alert twice consecutively
[15:11:28] <rmurphey> var foo = $('#foo'); if (foo.length) { ... }
[15:11:44] <BFranks> rmurphey: Got it.. http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/10/ .. Now what?
[15:13:14] <nicholasschulz> is there a way to empty ALL js vars at once?
[15:13:55] <dabear> nicholasschulz: what's the use case?
[15:14:50] <nicholasschulz> dabear: debugging. something is off with my script and i don't know if its because the variables record multiple items
[15:15:51] <rethus>  rmurphey:  thanks
[15:16:14] <dabear> BFranks: ui.value: Integer - the current handle's value
[15:16:18] <dabear> RTFM? :)
[15:16:24] <rmurphey> ^
[15:17:29] <ChkDigit> If I have a responseXML d like <elem attr1="1" attr2="2"> .  How do I get attr1 and attr2?  $("elem", d).attr("attr1") responds undefined.
[15:17:37] <kvnn> I have an issue where a custom event delegated by Backbone.View.events acts differently than (I think) it should. See http://jsfiddle.net/VdkBT/7/. Can anyone help clear that up?
[15:18:03] <BFranks> You know if everyone read the docs nobody would ask questions and less people would every take interest.. How boring would that be?
[15:18:11] <BFranks> -y
[15:18:17] <dabear> not very boring
[15:18:28] <dabear> it would be funny times, indeed
[15:18:42] <BFranks> I dunno.. I'm mildly amused when I get to answer a question (pretty damned rare)
[15:19:28] <[fields]> shoky:  thank you very much for helping me to find the trouble in my code.  very much appreciated.
[15:19:53] <BFranks> dabear: that did the trick.. yay! (Thanks!)
[15:20:08] <dabear> yay..query?
[15:20:38] <BFranks> $yes('?');
[15:29:56] <BFranks> dabear: So much noob so little time.. http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/21/  .. I'm used to just using something like "document.getElementById('pr1').innerHTML ='ui.value + '%';
[15:33:40] <gaius65> Hi!
[15:33:55] <gaius65> I believe I have found a bug, or am I doing something wrong here?
[15:33:55] <gaius65> http://jsfiddle.net/nNJu9/2/
[15:37:57] <thirdender> gaius65: I'm not sure if it's a bug... there are a few other people who posted similar issues 2 years ago
[15:38:12] <danzik171> gaius65: that might've been a bug in 1.7.2.  if you test against jQuery Edge, it looks fixed
[15:38:29] <thirdender> gaius65: the quickest fix to the jsfiddle you posted is to change .animate({ "left": 0 }) to .animate({ "left": "0%" })
[15:38:45] <rmurphey> gaius65: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10669
[15:38:57] <gaius65> thirdender: I found similar (already in 1.7.1 closed) bugs, but not this one
[15:39:15] <gaius65> rmurphey: this is similar, but a different bug!
[15:39:39] <gaius65> This bug got fixed in 1.7.1, but there the new value is a percentage, in my example the initial one is %
[15:39:49] <gaius65> thirdender: oh, nice :)
[15:40:19] <thirdender> gaius65, danzik171: hmm... interesting. jQuery Edge does fix the problem... but here's what I noticed...
[15:40:22] <gaius65> Has someone of you an account, it's a bug worth creating an issue for
[15:40:32] <gaius65> thirdender: ok, then perfect
[15:40:39] <thirdender> 1.7.2 returns .css("left") as 80%..
[15:40:40] <gaius65> What have you noticed?
[15:40:49] <thirdender> Edge returns .css("left") as 540px
[15:41:13] <gaius65> thirdender: Seems like the reason why it's working in the edge version
[15:41:35] <thirdender> gaius65: yes, but that also seems like a radical change to the .css() method too...
[15:42:25] <gaius65> true
[15:43:46] <thang> BFranks: http://jsfiddle.net/wJcwF/26/
[15:46:51] <BFranks> thang: LOL thanks! .. I was wondering why it jumped to fiddle ../27/
[16:36:30] <xhpx> Hi I'm totally new to Jquery and I love to get started learning and tried documentation. I'm wondering if there is any books that you guys can recommend
[16:38:30] <eddiemonge> xhpx: take a look at the jquery.com homepage. there are some books listed there
[16:45:25] <scalex000> hi
[16:45:45] <scalex000> I need help in jquery, im novice, but I try to learn fast
[16:46:29] <scalex000> I want to know if I can add another autocomplete on antoher php pages
[16:47:25] <bpwnr> http://jsfiddle.net/zzdGJ/ I'm trying to take an array of anchor elements and initiate jQuery UI's dialog on the content next to them.  I can't figure out a way to make each anchor correctly popup it's corresponding dialog.  Any help?
[16:49:08] <KWhat_Work> when i create a widget, under what circumstances would _create not be called?
[16:52:57] <shoky> bpwnr: 2 problems
[16:53:34] <shoky> bpwnr: you had .next('.modal') instead of .next('.dialog')
[16:54:06] <shoky> bpwnr: and, you need to be careful how you use that 'num'. because by the time those click handlers run, num will already be an invalid value
[16:54:24] <shoky> bpwnr: so a quick fix is:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/zzdGJ/2/
[16:54:38] <shoky> (i also added the jquery ui css)
[16:55:19] <bpwnr> shoky:  Thanks a bunch, I knew it was something like you just posted.  First error was just a typo, my bad.
[16:56:49] <scalex000> anyidea
[16:57:06] <scalex000> I already have one autocomplete for one page.
[16:58:22] <shoky> scalex000 you can put more than one autocomplete, yes
[17:01:31] <scalex000> shoky, let me show my code and pls teach me.
[17:03:47] <mattoly> heya #jquery
[17:04:08] <mattoly> anyone have any good experience with mobile safari and a script not firing correctly?

[17:08:17] <shoky> scalex000: you just do it the same for the second one
[17:08:34] <scalex000> shoky, I thought the same
[17:08:47] <MistuhKurtz> Just ask the question mattoly
[17:09:52] <mattoly> I've got a page that works fine in everything but mobile safari. Here's the jsfiddle:
[17:10:09] <mattoly> http://jsfiddle.net/sneakyness/qQGb8/3/
[17:10:41] <mattoly> when "stills" is clicked at the bottom, nothing happens. If "motion" is clicked, it works fine. Then, if you go back to "stills", suddenly it works
[17:10:44] <mattoly> and it's driving me nuts
[17:10:56] <Ralcala> hi fellas}
[17:11:26] <Ralcala> how many plugins can i load in one single index.html?
[17:11:37] <Ralcala> jquery plugins i mean
[17:11:46] <systemfault> as many as you want..
[17:11:54] <Ralcala> no conflicts?
[17:12:02] <systemfault> That depends on the plugins..
[17:12:07] <Ralcala> ok
[17:12:25] <Ralcala> look i working on html5 template
[17:12:42] <Ralcala> but now i got a tiny scroller

[17:14:27] <JAAulde> How can I ensure certain elements which were hidden via .hide() are visible when printing?
[17:15:03] <Ralcala> i got the sample in another index.html and on that page it works perfectly
[17:15:21] <Ralcala> i put the *.js and *.css files correctly
[17:15:27] <JAAulde> I suppose I could use a class which has display turned on in a media query for print
[17:16:08] <Ralcala> can you help please system?
[17:18:07] <Whirl3d> Ralcala, check to make sure that you code is enclosed in a doc.ready handler in the head of your original document. should look like $(document).ready(function () {       but it may look like $(function () { }    either is acceptable.
[17:18:44] <Ralcala> checking....
[17:19:51] <Whirl3d> mattoly, it appears to work for me without doing anything..
[17:20:03] <mattoly> what browser?
[17:20:09] <Whirl3d> Chrome
[17:20:12] <mattoly> ah yes
[17:20:16] <mattoly> it works in everything EXCEPT mobile safari
[17:20:20] <mattoly> that's why it's so odd
[17:20:22] <Whirl3d> It looks like your html is bad
[17:20:33] <Whirl3d> Lots of extra }{][}
[17:20:38] <mattoly> I thought it might be, but I can't find anything that's causing it
[17:20:39] <Whirl3d> at the top of the document
[17:20:44] <mattoly> lemme check that
[17:20:58] <Ralcala> original index.html    $(window).load(function() {  ....for a flexslider
[17:21:18] <JAAulde> Ok, I have this page: http://jaaulde.com/resume/ with certain elements (like job descriptions) getting hidden by jQuery when JS kicks in. Current behaviors are 1) content visible by default, then hidden by JS (ensures visibility if JS does not run) 2) content can be shown or hidden by clicking the arrows 3) show hide is animated. I want to maintain these exact behaviors, but I want the hidden elements visible when printing. Any thoughts on how I
[17:21:18] <JAAulde> 'd accomplish it?
[17:22:02] <Ralcala> tinyscroller same index.html      $(document).ready(function() { ........for the tinyscroll
[17:22:21] <ravenzz> JAAulde media type print
[17:22:41] <ravenzz> >> a stylesheet for print devices
[17:22:57] <Ralcala> what is wrong Whirl3d?
[17:23:24] <Whirl3d> mattoly, not sure if this will help, but there are some errors in validation: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/qQGb8/4/
[17:23:24] <JAAulde> ravenzz: I am using media queries in my CSS, but the only way I can think to do this is with a class which has display off in one media, and on in print. but how can I maintain the animation?
[17:23:31] <JAAulde> (brb)
[17:23:49] <Ralcala> maybe the plugin doesnt load i think....
[17:24:53] <mattoly> Whirl3d thanks. That's the weird part though, JSlint likes it fine.
[17:24:53] <ravenzz> JAAulde your main css should be valid only for screens and projectors but not for print(ers)
[17:25:08] <Whirl3d> it's not your code, its the HTML
[17:25:58] <Whirl3d> ignore the url in there, that's my site that I saved the temp file to to validate it. LOL
[17:26:16] <mattoly> oh wait, I see
[17:26:23] <mattoly> yeah, ha
[17:26:27] <mattoly> well dammit
[17:26:28] <stan_man_can> Any easy way to restrict an input box to only accept numbers?
[17:26:35] <mattoly> so it's not the part I did. that'a  relief
[17:27:59] <ravenzz> JAAulde also I wouldn't mention XHTML if you are going to apply for cool jobs in cool companies, just go with HTML(5)
[17:29:02] <Whirl3d> mattoly, cache $(this) in a varialble to make things a little faster and smoother and more legible.

[17:31:33] <pr0ton> it assumes that date is a string, i want it to use the variable. much like it does it in python
[17:32:22] <pr0ton> other than the obvious.- res = {}; res[date] = 1; console.log(res);

[18:32:38] <Ralcala> flexslider
[18:32:42] <shoky> when does one work and not another?
[18:32:50] <shoky> why are you including jquery 3 times?
[18:32:55] <Ralcala> i dont know
[18:33:11] <Ralcala> thats why iam here shoky...
[18:33:54] <shoky> Ralcala: include it ONCE

[18:59:17] <coldhead> good talking to you, PIZDECCIO
[19:07:01] <pace_t_zulu> hey guys ... does anyone know how to bind a function to the 'minimize' or 'restore' event for this extension for jquery ui dialog widget? http://www.droptoframe.com/?p=35
[19:08:07] <pace_t_zulu> doing it from a plugin
[19:10:08] <gus_> hmm, you could add code to the minimize and restore functions to .trigger('minimize') and .trigger('restore')
[19:10:22] <gus_> Then write some .on('minimize') and .on('restore')
[19:11:17] <gus_> minimize: function () { $(document).trigger('minimize'); ... etc }
[19:11:33] <gus_> don't know if that's the best way, just an idea.
[19:12:07] <pace_t_zulu> gus ... i've tried on('minimize')
[19:12:18] <pace_t_zulu> what i'd expect would work from my plugin ... is
[19:12:41] <pace_t_zulu> $(this.element).on('minimize', function() { // do some shit });
[19:12:47] <pace_t_zulu> gus_: ^
[19:13:00] <gus_> .on('minimize') won't work if nothing is triggering that event. the current implementation of "minimize" doesn't trigger an event.
[19:13:06] <pace_t_zulu> ah
[19:13:11] <pace_t_zulu> i'll try that
[19:13:11] <gus_> but i've only skimmed so maybe I'm wrong
[19:13:26] <gus_> that 'minimize' event name it arbitrary, btw
[19:13:43] <pace_t_zulu> so in the minimize function i'll add ...
[19:13:51] <gus_> you can make the implementation of minimize trigger anything you want like $(document).trigger('omgwtf');
[19:13:55] <pace_t_zulu> $(this).trigger('minimize')
[19:13:59] <gus_> You just have to make sure to catch that event
[19:15:07] <gus_> I'd try $(document).trigger('minimize) if your idea doesn't work
[19:15:15] <gus_> forgot a single quote ^^
[19:21:47] <pace_t_zulu> gus_: that doesn't seem to be working for me
[19:24:07] <pace_t_zulu> gus_: i'm trying to follow the jquery ui dialog code ...
[19:24:09] <pace_t_zulu> ie
[19:24:17] <pace_t_zulu> self._trigger('minimize')
[19:24:37] <pace_t_zulu> and i've tried $(document)._trigger('minimize') as well
[19:30:45] <gus_> pace_t_zulu, i've never used jquery ui dialog. this is what I was talking about though: http://jsfiddle.net/VDarq/1/
[19:30:52] <gus_> just triggering a custom event
[19:36:16] <pace_t_zulu> gus_: thanks, i think that will help
[19:46:33] <pace_t_zulu> sick
[19:46:44] <pace_t_zulu> gus_: thank you for your help ... i really appreciate it
[19:48:33] <gus_> no problem. as I said before, there may be a much cleaner way of doing it but that hack should do the trick. i don't really have the time atm to lookup the plugin implementation
[19:58:20] <azbyin> whats the best waqy to clone an element?
[19:59:02] <azbyin> newel = $("#myel").clone();   wil make newel have the same id attribute as the original element!
[20:03:21] <shoky> azbyin: yes, it will
[20:09:42] <quark> Is there a way to update a css setting of a class that is not currently in use jQuery('.target').css(...) doesn't work for this
[20:12:10] <shoky> quark what do you mean
[20:13:39] <quark> I have a div with on and off class...I want to update the css settings permamently for the on class
[20:14:04] <quark> while the div's class is assigned to off
[20:17:37] <shoky> you want to change the actual class css definition?
[20:17:44] <shoky> you can't/shouldn't
[20:19:00] <shoky> doesn't matter if the class is assigned to anything or not
[20:20:45] <quark> sorry for my ignorance but why?
[20:21:26] <shoky> because that's not how css works
[20:21:47] <shoky> you define a class, then elements either have that class or they don't
[20:21:55] <shoky> and they can have their own styles defined
[20:21:59] <gus_> I have a question for anyone willing to answer, what are your thoughts on mixing jQuery API with ole regular JS DOM API? Is the extra jQuery overhead negligible or should you try to use the JS DOM API when possible? I, personally, have always made a choice between going all jQuery or all traditional.
[20:22:22] <quark> but why is overwriting a class so taboo?
[20:23:07] <shoky> quark: ask marx
[20:23:23] <quark> i can change properties of active elements using jQuery().css
[20:23:28] <shoky> yep
[20:25:08] <shoky> quark: just use more classes
[20:25:21] <shoky> and selectively add and remove them from elements
[20:26:07] <quark> thanks shoky...I will attempt this ridding my self of previous perspective on css
[20:30:08] <shoky> gus_: if you already have jquery included, use jquery for DOM manipulation. usually it'll use the best DOM API methods for the job anyway. there's some overhead in creating the jquery wrapper objects, sure.. but i'd say optimize later when you actually run into performance problems
[20:31:18] <shoky> gus_: but, there's no problem with using them together.. $( document.getElementById('mama') ).remove()  works just fine
[20:31:54] <gus_> shoky: thanks for your reply. The reason I was asking is because I have a web app design professor who insists on indexing into the returned jQuery object in order to use DOM API methods rather than just operating on the jQuery object with the available methods
[20:32:29] <gus_> for example: $('#msg')[0].style.bgcolor = etc
[20:32:32] <shoky> that'd really depend on the context
[20:33:09] <shoky> that's fine. but i'm sure using .css() would be just as fine :)
[20:33:45] <shoky> and would take care of lots of cross-browser inconsistencies
[20:33:49] <shoky> and whatnot ;S
[20:34:25] <gus_> right. yeah I agree. you shouldn't prematurely optimize unless you know things are going to get heavy on the clientside
[20:35:13] <shoky> aye
[20:44:11] <azbyin> shoky, was away at lunch. anyway, i wanted to know how i would avoid having an element with a duplicate id in the dom tree
[20:44:28] <azbyin> set the id attribute to something random after the clone() operation?
[20:44:54] <shoky> azbyin: or .removeAttr('id')
[21:05:24] <azbyin> shoky, actually the node i am cloning has many elements under it that have ids
[21:05:51] <azbyin> i want to clone the tree from that node (which clone()) does, and remove/rename the ids of every element within
[21:06:25] <azbyin> tmp = $("#area").clone().removeAttr("id");   removes the id for only that particular element.
[21:07:44] <shoky> azbyin: i guess you could .clone().find('[id]').andSelf().removeAttr('id')
[21:08:08] <shoky> or just find('*') i dunno
[21:08:31] <azbyin> "[id]" makes a bit more sense, i.e. only the elements that the id attr
[21:08:50] <azbyin> how about renaming or simply adding a prefix/postfix to the cloned attrs ?
[21:09:00] <shoky> what's the difference?
[21:09:42] <shoky> why do you want to clone something that already has ids inside anyway
[21:10:21] <azbyin> i'm planning to "open" a select dropdown by cloning it and adding it to a different layer
[21:10:55] <shoky> why does it need to have an id?
[21:11:13] <azbyin> because i will trigger/select from this cloned select dropdown too :(
[21:11:21] <shoky> so what?
[21:11:23] <shoky> why not use classes?
[21:11:34] <azbyin> so if i know what prefix/postfix i will add, i know which elements i will be selecting
[21:11:42] <azbyin> i'm not looking at modifying the existing dropdown
[21:12:02] <shoky> k then change/remove the ids
[21:13:54] <shoky> to change you can do:  .clone().find('*').andSelf().attr( 'id', function(i, val) { return 'prefix-' + val } )
[21:18:18] <azbyin> tmp = $("#area").clone(true).removeAttr("id").find("[id]").andSelf().attr("id", function(i, val){ return 'CLO'+val })
[21:18:22] <azbyin> that works. thanks shoky
[21:22:41] <Lucky--> anyone deal with animated gif problems on android?
[21:24:20] <shoky> azbyin: if you did .removeAttr("id") on the root element then you don't need that .andSelf()

[21:59:24] <biffy> I am fairly new to jquery and to learn the basics I have made a couple of jquery plugins. I am after some information regarding calling my plugin without a selector - such as $().myPlugin() which lets say does not need a selector to function. Is this good practice? Is there a better way?
[22:02:13] <coldhead> biffy: if there's no need for a selector then yes, that's a good way to do it
[22:02:35] <biffy> It is not breaking some un/written law? It looks a bit dirty
[22:02:37] <coldhead> ben_alman's plugins that don't use selectors do it that way and he's Mister Plugin

[22:07:46] <subhojit777> I want to implement the scroll functionality with keypress through suggestion list in autocomplete textbox. Currently, I am using position() and scrollTop() functions to scroll to the current item , but its behaving in somewhat odd manner, the positions of the element varies, they are not always same. Any suggestions please that will help me scroll through suggestion list. And please don't refer me to any plugins, I can't use them the autocomplete i
[22:07:46] <subhojit777> s all custom.
[22:11:33] <BoMbMoNkEy> coldhead: got a cool question for u.
[22:12:01] <BoMbMoNkEy> coldhead: when do you use var, and when do you not need to?
[22:13:26] <coldhead> defaultro: it is your job if your job is to deliver working software
[22:13:37] <coldhead> you want to prove that your stuff works, right?
[22:13:47] <coldhead> BoMbMoNkEy: you always need it
[22:14:37] <BoMbMoNkEy> coldhead: $dom = $('foo').attr('something');
[22:14:45] <defaultro> ok
[22:14:51] <BoMbMoNkEy> coldhead: you don't in that case
[22:15:20] <defaultro> because coldhead, we have testers. I don't know what they're role is going to be if they will just execute the test cases I will write
[22:15:44] <defaultro> i think it's unfair for us
[22:16:14] <defaultro> i might be wrong since it's my first time to be in this kind of department
[22:20:39] <defaultro> What's the best way to test a webpage which heavily use jquery?
[22:20:47] <defaultro> non-human
[22:20:58] <styol> subhojit777: you might want to use keyup instead and you basically need to walk an array or something of the potential items, maybe keep track in a var where you're at in that walk, and goto the next or previous item based on that var.. perhaps adding and removing some sort of class to have special CSS indicating which item is selected
[22:22:25] <gnarf> ?learn @BoMbMoNkEy
[22:22:25] <bot-t> BoMbMoNkEy, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)

[22:22:55] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[22:23:12] <gnarf> ^^^ i'm pretty sure that explains "var" in like chapter 1-3
[22:23:49] <BoMbMoNkEy> gnarf: Sure, but do you know why you don't need to declare var when you do $dom = $('foo').attr('something');
[22:24:32] <gnarf> BoMbMoNkEy: you don't ever "need" to declare it for an assignment, but if you don't you are writing to a "global" variable which is almost always horrible practice
[22:24:36] <gnarf> ?jshint
[22:24:36] <bot-t> http://jshint.com/
[22:24:45] <gnarf> ^^^ that tool even warns about it
[22:25:08] <subhojit777> styol: thanks... I think my code implements everything that you said.. just the scroll is not working. Its like when I press down arrow key or up arrow key it will get the keycode and based on that it will do some processing like adding and removing class
[22:25:34] <subhojit777> styol: And I think I have found the solution here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2905867/how-to-scroll-to-specific-item-using-jquery
[22:25:58] <subhojit777> I just need to show this to my superior whether this will work
[22:26:02] <subhojit777> styol: thanks again
[22:27:18] <BoMbMoNkEy> gnarf: So jquery automatically writes data to a global variable with the name you specify?
[22:27:39] <gnarf> BoMbMoNkEy: read those three links
[22:27:46] <gnarf> BoMbMoNkEy: thats javascript
[22:27:51] <gnarf> ?jsisjs
[22:27:51] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[22:28:39] <gnarf> thats just the default behavior of javascript, a variable assignment to an identifier not defined in the current scope assumes global
[22:29:27] <BoMbMoNkEy> gnarf: what if there is no global variable with that identifier?
[22:30:47] <gnarf> BoMbMoNkEy: it creates one
[22:31:13] <BoMbMoNkEy> gnarf: thanks.
[22:31:23] <gnarf> var defines an identifier within the function it is defined in
[22:31:57] <BoMbMoNkEy> gnarf: i noticed alot of jsfiddle test cases that don't bother using var.
[22:32:10] <jonkersjoe> hi a quick js question: if I have function asd(){…} and I create an object from it, var obj = new asd(); how can I get the function name "asd" to be returned back as a string ? I tried typeof without success ?
[22:32:34] <gnarf> jonkersjoe: there is no reliable cross-browser way to determine that
[22:32:50] <jonkersjoe> damn it I was hoping that you wouldn't say that
[22:32:54] <gnarf> BoMbMoNkEy: you should read those three links for starters references, its worth it
[22:33:16] <gnarf> jonkersjoe: if you're looking for a "typeof" you can do "myobj instanceof asd"
[22:33:29] <BoMbMoNkEy> gnarf: no worries.
[22:34:13] <gnarf> jonkersjoe: assuming you aren't dealing with cross frame js that works
[22:35:01] <jonkersjoe> crossframe ?
[22:35:09] <jonkersjoe> I'll have a quick look at instanceof
[22:36:46] <jonkersjoe> instanceof seems to be ok, it's returning back a bool which I can use. does this have browser implementation issues that you are aware of ?
[22:38:36] <coldhead> defaultro: testers can find actual broken use cases that your automated testing doesn't find. like if a message is displayed and immediately it disappears
[22:39:55] <coldhead> defaultro: selenium is pretty good for stress testing
[22:44:45] <theere> hey guys, does this work. this.find("span.year").innerHTML
[22:45:17] <theere> i need to add the year to another this.find, not really sure how to go about this
[22:45:25] <coldhead> you either want .html() or [0].innerHTML
[22:45:52] <coldhead> .find('span.year')[0].innerHTML
[22:45:55] <coldhead> ya feel me?
[22:47:33] <theere> ok, now can i just do this:  var temp = (this.find("span.year")[0].innerHTML + (this.find("span.month")[0].innerHTML)
[22:48:25] <coldhead> in that case it would be better to do var temp = this.find('span')[0].innerHTML; temp = temp + temp;
[22:49:28] <coldhead> oh wait, you want yr AND month

[22:51:30] <coldhead> i wonder if that would work

[22:56:51] <coldhead> i don't think so, azbyin
[22:56:59] <coldhead> you can use ~~ instead of parseInt

[23:01:56] <AaronCampbell> coldhead: That looks useful.  Thanks
[23:05:19] <gnarf> jQuery('.img-wrapper').map(function(){ return $(this).height(); }).get();
[23:05:24] <gnarf> AaronCampbell: ^^^
[23:05:35] <gnarf> gets you an array of all matched element's heights
[23:05:49] <coldhead> AaronCampbell: http://jsfiddle.net/XSFnz/
[23:06:07] <gnarf> damn coldhead was suggesting that ;)
[23:06:35] <coldhead> its' hard to believe
[23:06:44] <coldhead> these are truly the last days
[23:06:47] <mindis|wurk> is there any performance difference in this case between .each and .map?
[23:07:24] <gnarf> mindis|wurk: perf, very little, but map is more "direct" - you don't even need to put it into a variable, you could just use it again
[23:07:28] <coldhead> map is probably faster because it can break the chain
[23:07:35] * coldhead speculates
[23:08:05] <gnarf> the perf difference is negligable, either way the most perf will probably be spent calling the iterator function or the selector anyway
[23:08:17] <gnarf> map just looks better
[23:08:44] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: how did you leave a message for me to the bot ?
[23:08:46] <coldhead> and map is one char less typing than each
[23:08:53] <ruby_on_tails> whats the command to do so ?
[23:09:01] <coldhead> bot-t: tell ruby_on_tails some ol' bullshit
[23:09:19] <ruby_on_tails> i have to exit and come back to get the message ?
[23:09:29] <coldhead> no, the bot needs to be here
[23:09:39] <gnarf> b-ot: tell ruby_on_tails b-ot is more reliable tho
[23:09:40] <b-ot> gnarf, I’ll tell ruby_on_tails about that.
[23:09:40] <coldhead> it triggers next time you speak
[23:09:43] <coldhead> no part necessary
[23:09:46] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[23:09:47] <b-ot> ruby_on_tails, you have one new message, just say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[23:09:48] <azbyin> coldhead, or you simply send a memo
[23:09:51] <azbyin>  /help memo
[23:09:56] <ruby_on_tails> b-ot: read
[23:09:56] <b-ot> ruby_on_tails, from gnarf, 16s ago: b-ot is more reliable tho
[23:10:03] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[23:10:10] <coldhead> memos are too personal, azbyin
[23:10:13] <ruby_on_tails> nice stuff
[23:10:19] <coldhead> i only these them for notices of an erotic nature
[23:10:34] <azbyin> huh? you mean you want to be a "twit" making a tweet so the public can see?
[23:10:36] <azbyin> :p
[23:10:43] <coldhead> yes
[23:10:53] <coldhead> especially with recriminations or kudos
[23:10:58] <coldhead> i forget which i gave ruby
[23:11:03] <coldhead> probably some of each
[23:11:19] <ruby_on_tails> it was a message with a tweet about my site from javascript_weekly
[23:11:38] <coldhead> oh neet
[23:12:28] <ruby_on_tails> just pushed the improved home page
[23:13:03] <coldhead> give us a link
[23:13:13] <ruby_on_tails> http://thecodeplayer.com/
[23:13:32] <coldhead> mmm pinteresty
[23:13:50] <ruby_on_tails> the background is a texture ?
[23:13:58] <ruby_on_tails> or a blueish color ?
[23:14:50] <coldhead> i don't know man, didn't YOU do it?
[23:15:00] <ruby_on_tails> i meant, clear your cache :P
[23:15:06] <ruby_on_tails> some people were seeing older version still
[23:15:44] <coldhead> oh right
[23:15:50] <coldhead> i get a nice blue textrure
[23:16:00] <coldhead> i nuke my cache on the regular
[23:16:27] <ruby_on_tails> aah ok, thats the new one, lesser pinteresty than the previous version
[23:16:43] <ruby_on_tails> i guess i will keep the pinterest style for a while, its useful
[23:17:20] <coldhead> and women love it
[23:19:25] <theere> hey i'm using
[23:19:25] <theere> var postDate = ($(this).find('span.year, span.utc_time').text() + " UTC");
[23:19:25] <theere> postDate = Date.parse(postDate);
[23:19:31] <theere> postDate will output the correct string
[23:19:38] <theere> but that string in the Date.parse returns Null
[23:19:47] <tw2113> i heard a rumor, that coldhead is hardcore, and disables caching on every browser he uses
[23:19:48] <theere> do i have to convert postDate to a string somehow?
[23:20:14] <theere> at the date.js my input is parsed correctly
[23:20:42] <coldhead> i wouldn't even know how, tw2113
[23:20:48] <coldhead> i am a browser noob
[23:20:49] <theere> datejs.com website the string parses correctly..
[23:21:25] <coldhead> b-ot: eval 'foo'
[23:21:32] <coldhead> ?> |
[23:21:47] <coldhead> can you get this up on jsfiddle or jsbn, theere ?
[23:23:10] <orangey> hello all
[23:23:47] <ruby_on_tails> hello orangey
[23:26:56] <orangey> I'm having some difficulties with cross-browser compatibility for my jquery calendar/date picker. Here is my rendered page: https://gist.github.com/3141131 ; Here it is separated into pieces on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/hdnmu/ . The issue is that the calendar has no selectable dates: it appears 'shiftsWorking' does not happen ?
[23:38:30] <azbyin> i want to copy every computed style of an element to another element. hwats the best way to do this?
[23:38:48] <ruby_on_tails> azbyin: all the styles ?
[23:39:15] <sente> i assume azbyin wants the second element to look exactly like the first, regardless of where each style element was set/computed
[23:39:35] <azbyin> yes
[23:39:51] <azbyin> i want to copy the computed styles
[23:40:01] <coldhead> that's not easy :(
[23:40:07] <ruby_on_tails> azbyin: i guess thats what css classes are for
[23:40:22] <ruby_on_tails> pick the id/class of the elements and apply that to the duplicate element you have
[23:40:43] <sente> azbyin: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6416527/217652
[23:40:52] <azbyin> ruby_on_tails, umm.. maybe you weren;t here when i had been going on about what i want to do. but i am not going to modify the existing elements!
[23:41:16] <ruby_on_tails> azbyin: ok
[23:43:05] <some_dude> harro
[23:43:24] <sente> herrooo
[23:46:36] <orangey> AHA! Narrowed it down.. It seems this is the line it doesn't like: 		      dateDB.setDate (dateDB.getDate()+1);
[23:47:25] <orangey> woo. narrowing it down even further. It appears this is the command it doesn't like: dateDB.getDate()
[23:48:02] <azbyin> sente, umm.. how do I use a jquery plugin?
[23:48:18] <azbyin> i simply put it in its own js file and source that in <script> ?
[23:48:57] <sente> usually, yes
[23:48:59] <sente> azbyin: http://upshots.org/javascript/jquery-copy-style-copycss
[23:49:29] <sente> azbyin: http://jsfiddle.net/b9sN7/1/
[23:49:43] <orangey> got it! Problem is this: new Date(shiftDays.shiftList[i].Shift.date)
[23:49:48] <orangey> I think a #js problem..
[23:50:21] <some_dude> using setTimeout in callback function in animate(). on mouseover $(element).animate(...,300,setTimeout(reset_flag(),500)).  next time the event is triggered the animate() doesn't run for some reason.
[23:53:20] <Whirl3d> because you aren't calling animate correctly the first time (callback is misconfigured, I think)
[23:53:37] <Whirl3d> and use .delay if you need to delay a queued animation
[23:57:10] <azbyin> sente, what is the license for that bit of code?
