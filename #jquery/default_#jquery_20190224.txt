[03:41:47] <rewisy23> Just started with jQuery 3.3.1. Please help!
[03:41:54] <rewisy23> When I am doing $('li'), I get an object with my lis. Perfectly as expected. But when I am doing $('li').click(() => {console.log($(this))}), I get some inconceivable "Object [ Window ]" on click.
[03:42:01] <rewisy23> Can someone please tell me what is happening?
[03:47:36] <rewisy23> Sorry, first time here? Is this chat alive?
[03:47:50] <rewisy23> Sorry, first time here. Is this chat alive?
[03:54:29] <salad> sometimes
[03:55:10] <salad> as always, don't ask to ask, just ask.
[04:04:47] <rewisy23> Thanks! I already asked before, you just wasn't there.

[04:09:54] <shoky> rewisy23: `this` behaves differently inside arrow functions
[04:10:51] <rewisy23> Thank you! Let me try it in a moment.
[04:11:02] <shoky> rewisy23: with jquery if you want to get the `this` that jquery sets, you need to use a regular non-arrow function. alternatively:  $('li').click((e) => {console.log(e.target)})
[04:12:15] <shoky> rewisy23: sorry, i meant e.currentTarget
[04:12:43] <shoky> rewisy23: oops i'm too tired, that's not an event handler.  disregard everything i said except my first sentence ;D
[04:13:12] <shoky> rewisy23: WOW i'm really tired :) it IS an event handler. do not disregard. jeez. i'll go to bed, gnight
[04:13:41] <rewisy23> good night :)
[04:16:19] <rewisy23> thanks a lot, it really works now
[05:12:22] <paule32> hello
[05:13:18] <paule32> i searching for windows xp like windows container (with windows bar/icons) - can you help?
[05:13:36] <robertmaxrees> wat
[05:13:47] <paule32> hi robert
[05:13:53] <robertmaxrees> what are you looking for?
[05:14:21] <paule32> css styled dialog boxes in windows xp manner
[05:14:34] <robertmaxrees> ... why?
[05:14:57] <paule32> o.O
[05:15:12] <robertmaxrees> either way - sounds like you want #css maybe?
[05:15:35] <paule32> ok
[05:15:44] <paule32> i would emulate windows xp desk
[05:16:57] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you'd want to emulate windows xp :/
[05:17:50] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: maybe if you have users on xp and you want to make it look like their system is melting down due to it being long-eol
[05:19:00] <Robdgreat> while having it be indistinguishable from the actual notices that things are melting down for the same reason
[05:19:17] <robertmaxrees> that's... not a good reason imo lol
[05:19:19] <Robdgreat> microsoft agent and encarta are two reasons I keep an xp vm around
[05:19:22] <Robdgreat> no, not imo either
[05:19:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[05:20:21] <Robdgreat> I haven't figured out how to run my copy of encarta 95 natively in win 10 for high school nostalgia-fests
[05:20:36] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[05:20:41] <Robdgreat> f'realtho
[05:21:06] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i'd just... not use encarta tbh
[05:22:09] <Robdgreat> if I wanted to not use it, I would have refrained from paying 50 cents for it at salvation army
[05:22:19] <Robdgreat> that was an option
[05:22:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[05:23:06] <Robdgreat> my best friend and I spent an inordinate amount of time listening to and remixing audio clips from that thing back in the day
[05:23:14] <Robdgreat> I had a very sad childhood
[05:24:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not sad imo
[05:25:12] <robertmaxrees> i spent many, many hours making music and a teenager.  nothing wrong with that.
[05:25:30] <Robdgreat> "ask what your country can do for you, not what you can do for your country"
[05:26:06] <Robdgreat> it was mostly voice clips, not much music from that
[05:26:29] <Robdgreat> I made music on my dad's guitar. No computer involved
[05:26:34] <robertmaxrees> how were you remixing them?
[05:26:42] <Robdgreat> oh, rearranging words
[05:26:49] <robertmaxrees> ah
[05:26:50] <Robdgreat> like the above
[05:27:02] <Robdgreat> that's not how the quote historically went
[05:29:04] <robertmaxrees> anyway, i gotta sleep.  kbyeeeeee
[05:29:26] <Robdgreat> o/

[12:32:22] <Log84> hi
[12:33:40] <Log84> i'm interested in Single page application on webbrowser . I went from adobe flash actionscript experience. what's your opinion to improve my old skills?
[12:58:05] <znf> can you have multiple, uhm... promise actions?
[12:58:20] <znf> ie: thisPromise.then(function(...) ...
[12:58:35] <znf> then after this, again, thisPromise.then(function(...) something else...
[13:15:41] <shoky> znf: yes
[13:19:24] <znf> neat
[13:38:17] <jak2020> anyone know a chanel for jQueryMobile?
[13:41:27] <shoky> umm i think jquerymobile is rather dead
[14:02:48] <znf> Has anyone used Parsley? I'm trying to initialise it with javascript (as opposed to the data-* attributes), but I can't figure out how to say that a specific field needs to use my custom validator
[14:17:21] <jak2020> shoky dead?
[14:17:23] <jak2020> why?
[14:20:41] <shoky> jak2020: it hasn't had any activity in like 2 years
[14:21:32] <shoky> and well, from what i remember it was clunky and slow :p
