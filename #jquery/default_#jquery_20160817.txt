[00:00:06] <dopie> whirledpress, Im digesting it thank you very much Im going to ask some questions about it if thats ok , I really want to learn this
[00:00:55] <whirledpress> sure
[00:03:25] <dopie> whirledpress, ok when it loads up rotates.eq(i)  i == 0
[00:04:02] <whirledpress> the first element index in a jquery collection is 0
[00:04:14] <dopie> correct
[00:04:15] <whirledpress> $("elements").eq(0) selects the first element in the list
[00:04:41] <dopie> but how come i === 0 and not null the first time?
[00:05:04] <dopie> because whats throwing me off is the function(i)
[00:05:11] <whirledpress> because we call ShowNext(0)
[00:05:59] <whirledpress> i==whatever number we pass to it. So the first time, we call showNext(0) then everytime showNext is called subsequently, it's incremented or set back to 0
[00:06:23] <dopie> shhhhhh ok
[00:06:33] <dopie> so the function(i) is basically 0...
[00:06:35] <dopie> ok ok ok ok
[00:06:38] <dopie> i totally get this code
[00:07:05] <whirledpress> I am sure there is a great way to do it that someone here could write in about 30 characters...
[00:07:32] <dopie> I'm going to put this in my app and console log the crapo out of it
[00:08:34] <whirledpress> i updated the pen with comments if that helps
[00:10:50] <dopie> Ahh thank you very much
[00:11:04] <dopie> is there a reason id's are added?
[00:12:44] <whirledpress> At first I was going to use ids to style the elements to make it more obvious. no need for ids
[00:18:28] <dopie> whirledpress, wow thank you very much for everything I know understand a lot more...
[00:51:01] <VectorX> is there a function in jquery to get the contents/text of the clipboard, trying to get the text and put it into a var
[01:09:25] <whirledpress> VectorX, I don't think so.
[01:10:39] <VectorX> whirledpress thanks
[01:11:04] <VectorX> its being a pain
[01:11:19] <whirledpress> Now if you are dealing with text only, you could make it so that you capture the Ctrl-C keyboard input
[01:11:34] <whirledpress> and whatever is selected, you can assume is what is intended to be copied.
[01:13:42] <joekarma> Does anyone know of a plugin that allows users to drag and drop to match (either through alignment or a connector) items in column a to items in column b? I made a quick attempt at Googling, but couldn’t find anything. Seems like the sort of thing that would already exist, so I’d rather not reinvent the wheel…
[01:14:06] <whirledpress> jquery UI draggable and sortable
[01:14:16] <whirledpress> * droppable
[01:14:58] <VectorX> whirledpress im trying to use it from a new window, so what ever the user had in the clipboard when entering the window, trying to speed up a local data entry process
[01:15:45] <whirledpress> You could maybe use cookies to cache the data they want to copy and then in the new window lookup that cookie value?
[01:16:20] <joekarma> Thanks whirledpress, I did think of that, and it’s better than starting from scratch, but is there anything more specific to matching items up that belong together? AFAIK I’d still need quite a bit of custom code with the draggable/droppable library?
[01:16:38] <whirledpress> not really...
[01:17:01] <whirledpress> look at https://jqueryui.com/droppable/
[01:17:21] <joekarma> Having a look now
[01:17:30] <joekarma> Do you know if there’s a name for the UI element I’m describing?
[01:17:32] <whirledpress> The accept example might be what you want
[01:17:39] <whirledpress> droppable
[01:18:15] <joekarma> I’m thinking a table with two columns, allows reorganizing on the y axis...
[01:18:20] <whirledpress> or possibly sortable
[01:18:36] <whirledpress> https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists
[01:18:40] <joekarma> But with columns being reorderable independently of one another
[01:18:40] <joekarma> aha
[01:18:43] <joekarma> that sounds right
[01:18:57] <joekarma> That’s exactly what I wanted, thanks!
[01:19:02] <whirledpress> np
[03:17:39] <MarkX> anyone got any "arraybuffers" for dummies links?
[03:25:03] <slax0r> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=arraybuffers
[04:49:32] <JoshG> Does anyone here know why the .html function in jquery performs html encoding on individual symbols but not on valid html tags?
[04:49:55] <JoshG> seems like inconsistent behaviour
[04:51:37] <Cork> JoshG: cause it is meant to handle html
[04:51:50] <Cork> JoshG: if you want html escape use .text()
[04:53:34] <JoshG> I understand, it just seems misleading that sometimes it encodes and sometimes it doesn't so I was wondering what the rationale was. Surely the expected behaviour would be to not encode anything
[04:54:31] <Cork> JoshG: it doesn't encode
[04:54:41] <Cork> .html parses the string you send it into dom
[04:54:55] <Cork> when you later extract text from it, it serializes the dom to html
[04:55:01] <Cork> and what you get back is valid html
[04:55:13] <Cork> so html entities that needs to be escaped will be so
[04:59:01] <JoshG> Cork: Got it, thanks for that.
[05:31:56] <baako> hi guys i need abit of jquery / html help
[05:32:10] <slax0r> normally you'd just ask waht you need help with
[05:32:16] <baako> https://jsfiddle.net/baako/ecjxsdn4/2/ if you expand the result and click on go to payments
[05:32:46] <baako> you will see that the step 2 is below and the top bit has too many space
[05:33:10] <baako> any idea what i should do to align them ?
[05:33:17] <baako> hopefully that makes sense
[05:34:15] <Cork> baako: are you sure you have included all the css you need?
[05:34:27] <Cork> cause not sure what you're refering to in that fiddle
[05:34:47] <slax0r> Cork: expand the result window
[05:34:54] <Cork> what result window
[05:34:54] <slax0r> then click go to payment
[05:35:03] <baako> cork not all the css but the fiddle shows what it should show
[05:35:03] <slax0r> Cork: the bottom right window in the fiddle
[05:35:13] <slax0r> baako: you are using bootstrap, correct?
[05:35:20] <slax0r> the reason that payment is bellow there
[05:35:26] <slax0r> is because it is in a "row" of its own
[05:36:43] <baako> slax0r, i cannot fit it in the other row because it is md 9 while the "my order" is md 3
[05:37:21] <slax0r> baako: then have your click handler move it in there if you do not want to change layout
[05:38:20] <baako> slax0r, what do you mean please?
[05:38:54] <slax0r> programatically move that piece of html markup that is "payment" into the above row
[05:42:52] <codecutter> i have a click listen attached to <a> how do i get the actual <a> that was clicked <ul><li><a../></li>...</ul>?
[05:42:59] <codecutter> listener*
[05:43:41] <dni-> $("a").click(function(){var thisa = $(this)});
[05:43:45] <slax0r> $(this)
[05:45:18] <codecutter> is there another way?
[05:46:04] <codecutter> how is my line this.on('click', {'foo': this.foo});
[05:49:12] <Cork> codecutter: this isn't inherited into the function foo there
[05:49:24] <Cork> codecutter: so this should still be the element you are looking for
[05:50:04] <codecutter> $(this) gives me flight's component (framework)
[05:50:09] <codecutter> let me  a pastebin
[05:52:24] <codecutter> nvm
[05:53:17] <dni-> jQuery(this)
[05:53:49] <codecutter> Cork: http://pastebin.com/Vu6SwsLx
[05:55:23] <Cork> codecutter: run console.log(typeof(this)) and see what that gives you
[05:56:23] <Cork> bah no typeof doesn't work
[05:56:25] <Cork> forgot that
[05:57:00] <Cork> codecutter: console.log(this.constructor.name)
[05:57:03] <codecutter> is there another way to get a reference to the link that was just clicked with having to use $(this)?
[05:57:17] <Cork> codecutter: no not really
[05:57:28] <Cork> you can do $(event.target).closest('a')
[05:57:42] <Cork> and you aren't allowed to nest a tags inside each other
[05:57:50] <Cork> but that won't work in normal cases
[05:57:55] <Cork> you REALLY should use this
[05:58:14] <codecutter> that gives me "component"
[05:58:23] <Cork> inside the click handler?
[05:58:45] <codecutter> yes
[05:58:47] <Cork> ok, then it means the framework is using its own on method
[05:58:52] <codecutter> right
[05:58:56] <Cork> and it is binding the this variable
[05:59:03] <codecutter> yes
[05:59:05] <Cork> and making it impossible to access what the clicked element was
[05:59:09] <codecutter> sorry i should have said that
[05:59:21] <Cork> so ya, you can't get it
[05:59:30] <codecutter> hmm
[05:59:47] <codecutter> let me try $(event.target).closest('a')
[05:59:53] <Cork> hmm
[05:59:54] <Cork> wait
[06:00:13] <Cork> codecutter: check $(event.currentTarget)
[06:00:27] <Cork> it should work as long as you don't care about old browsers
[06:01:06] <codecutter> that works
[06:01:12] <Cork> though it might give you document
[06:01:18] <Cork> as you use a delegated event handler...
[06:01:51] <Cork> (i HATE when ppl remove this from event handlers...)
[06:02:07] <codecutter> i think thats how you normally get a reference to a clicked object on flight
[07:06:17] <gingitsune> Is it possible to load two different versions of the same jquery module?
[07:06:30] <gingitsune> What I'm asking is there anything i can do to namespace them?
[07:07:07] <gingitsune> I working with a framework that have made some changes to a edotor that i need to undo
[07:07:45] <Cork> gingitsune: depends on how the plugin is written
[07:07:49] <cannap> jquery has modules?
[07:07:54] <Cork> plugins
[07:08:12] <cannap> ah
[07:08:31] <Cork> gingitsune: if it is a widget factory you can change the widget prefix
[07:08:53] <Cork> gingitsune: or if it isn't you can just change the plugin to a pluginNameOld
[07:08:56] <Cork> or something like that
[07:09:08] <Cork> it is usually not too many lines you need to change to do that
[07:25:18] <amigooo> hey guys I need to get the submit button, which belongs to a text field. I have the textfield with (this) and I need to get the ID of the submit button. No matter what I try, it is not working. I tried with closest, parent, find etc. I don't get the button...
[07:27:06] <Cork> amigooo: why do you need the submit button?
[07:27:23] <Cork> to disable it?
[07:27:53] <amigooo> yes
[07:29:42] <Cork> amigooo: i would do something like $(this).closest('form').find('input[type="submit"]')
[07:29:54] <Cork> amigooo: or $(this).closest('form').find('button')
[07:30:00] <Cork> if you use <button> as submit buttons
[07:31:46] <amigooo> Cork: That's exactly what I did and it is not working... I get all the time this:
[07:31:46] <amigooo> https://gyazo.com/39004691698ecb6836b9100400cac613
[07:32:16] <Cork> amigooo: make a jsfiddle with the selector and the form structure
[07:42:37] <amigooo> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/8Lbfzcvy/1/
[07:43:35] <Cork> amigooo: that one works for me
[07:43:42] <Cork> length: 1,
[07:44:07] <amigooo> lol wait hold on
[07:44:10] <wannab3> hi, if i use $.post method, it replaces ' with &#39;
[07:44:21] <wannab3> how to make it not replace the quatation marks
[07:44:43] <slax0r> it doesn't replace, it urlencodes
[07:44:47] <slax0r> just urldecode on the other end
[07:45:20] <wannab3> well, how to make it not urlencode
[07:45:42] <Cork> wannab3: you would have to change content-type of the post
[07:45:51] <Cork> cause www-form-encoded are supposed to be url encoded
[07:46:07] <Cork> uh, wait a min
[07:46:16] <Cork> wannab3: are you sure post is doing this?
[07:46:21] <wannab3> yes
[07:46:26] <Cork> cause ' isn't a special character
[07:46:28] <wannab3> console.log says right things
[07:46:35] <wannab3> the backend sees &#39;
[07:46:38] <Woet> wannab3: show your code
[07:46:40] <Cork> one min
[07:46:42] <Woet> wannab3: frontend and backend
[07:47:15] <wannab3> you know django?
[07:47:55] <wannab3> https://dpaste.de/ZyyN
[07:48:01] <Cork> wannab3: https://jsfiddle.net/9o0ea9hk/
[07:48:26] <Cork> so make sure it isn't server side doing something
[07:48:30] <Cork> cause jquery doesn't encode it
[07:48:47] <gingitsune> The plugin is summernote
[07:48:48] <wannab3> well djagno ppl said that django doesnt encode it
[07:48:58] <wannab3> w/e
[07:49:00] <wannab3> ty
[07:49:04] <Woet> wannab3: im not seeing any debug code in django.
[07:49:20] <Woet> wannab3: and you can check what is being sent in the network tab of your browser
[07:49:22] <gingitsune> I think its a jquery plugin, but not sure
[07:49:24] <Cork> wannab3: the raw data it sends is: test=it's+the+life
[07:49:27] <Woet> wannab3: that way you can be sure.
[08:03:25] <amigooo> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/a83mg7qt/1/
[08:03:30] <amigooo> this is how the code is exactly
[08:03:38] <amigooo> it marks already the last parts
[08:03:48] <amigooo> but I have no idea why and now it is not working anymore either
[08:04:41] <Cork> amigooo: your html is invalid
[08:04:49] <Cork> amigooo: the submit button isn't inside the form tag
[08:05:26] <amigooo> cork: why? The submit button is before </form>
[08:05:48] <Cork> amigooo: https://jsfiddle.net/a83mg7qt/2/
[08:05:56] <Cork> amigooo: cause <form> can't be a child of <table>
[08:05:58] <Woet> amigooo: stop using tables for markup, tables is for tabular data.
[08:06:04] <Cork> that too
[08:06:30] <amigooo> oh wow
[08:06:32] <amigooo> that was just it...
[08:06:36] <amigooo> thank you very very much
[08:06:38] <amigooo> how silly...
[08:06:45] <Woet> amigooo: now get rid of the table
[08:06:57] <Cork> amigooo: but ya, i strongly recommend following Woet suggestion and use css to style that content instead
[08:07:26] <Cork> amigooo: i also recommend running the page through w3c validator
[08:07:41] <Cork> amigooo: https://validator.w3.org/
[08:07:45] <Cork> and make sure it is valid
[08:08:06] <amigooo> Okay I will thank you !
[08:09:47] <TimLoal> quick trivial question, var self = this;  in a self-contained function in a widget, is there and benefit to declaring and using var self - this?
[08:10:13] <Cork> TimLoal: if you need to pass it into a function
[08:10:27] <Cork> you need to do it or you will lose the value (as this is local to each function)
[08:10:42] <TimLoal> so not for as self contained function with no call backs
[08:10:53] <Cork> ya
[08:11:00] <Cork> it is only if you want to keep the value around
[08:11:01] <TimLoal> coollio
[08:11:18] <TimLoal> right thanks
[08:11:55] <TimLoal> thats nice because i like this as a key word
[08:16:38] <amigooo> Cork: Everything works now, how I wanted it to be. Thank you again! See ya
[08:34:45] <_Justice_> Im trying to get focusout/blur working but its not triggering for some reason
[08:35:37] <_Justice_> tried  $('#txtUrl').off().on('focusout', function () {.....}); and .focusout() and blur etc but still not triggering when i do focus out.
[08:36:44] <_Justice_> tried with $('#txtUrl').focus(); just above and it does indeed focus on the element but still not triggering when i tab or click outside .
[08:36:49] <TimLoal> _Justice_ can you knock up an simple example on http://jsfiddle.net
[08:37:33] <Justice> Hm will try but almost sure it will work there -_-'
[08:39:37] <TimLoal> going through the process can be benificial, googling the functions for hints
[08:41:12] <TimLoal> its a very useful practice to knock up simple test cases when something is foxing you
[08:43:50] <Justice> TimLoal: hm; https://jsfiddle.net/pvdwLLmt/
[08:45:57] <Cork> Justice: that is a div
[08:46:02] <Cork> it doesn't have focus
[08:46:06] <Cork> so it can't lose it
[08:46:45] <Justice> hm original code is input lemme update the fiddle
[08:46:47] <Cork> also... don't use alert for testing >_<'
[08:46:53] * Cork kills his browser
[08:46:54] <Justice> thought div had that
[08:46:57] <Justice> :P
[08:50:15] <Justice> Hm
[08:50:16] <Justice> https://jsfiddle.net/pvdwLLmt/
[08:50:19] <Justice> it triggers focusin
[08:50:20] <Justice> but not out
[08:50:25] <Justice> also its still alert :P
[08:50:50] <AwkwardCough> you should use console.log instead of alert
[08:51:23] <Justice> https://jsfiddle.net/pvdwLLmt/1/
[08:51:35] <Justice> since im doing colors no reason for alert or console,
[08:51:43] <Justice> colours"
[08:52:22] <TimLoal> why are you using off?
[08:52:24] <AwkwardCough> im not sure you need the .off
[08:52:38] <Cork> Justice: you first remove all event handlers
[08:52:41] <Cork> then bind focusout
[08:52:47] <Cork> then you remove all event handlers
[08:52:51] <Cork> and bind an focusin
[08:52:56] <Cork> so focusout won't be there
[08:52:56] <Justice> hm thats true
[08:53:17] <Cork> you should avoid blanket removing event handlers
[08:53:25] <Cork> it makes the code very annoying to extend in the future
[08:53:37] <Cork> if you want to have a set of handlers you want to later remove
[08:53:41] <Cork> use namespaces
[08:53:43] <TimLoal> try this
[08:53:44] <TimLoal> https://jsfiddle.net/2L7570ps/
[08:54:19] <Justice> yeah got it working without off, makes sense...
[08:54:31] <Justice> bad habbit of using off because of double bindings etc.
[08:54:39] <Cork> Justice: https://jsfiddle.net/pvdwLLmt/2/
[08:54:47] <Cork> is what i would recommend if you really need .off
[08:54:54] <TimLoal> at least i learnt what off is
[08:55:07] <Cork> TimLoal: it is the new name for .unbind
[08:55:32] <Cork> Justice: also you should fix so you don't double bind
[08:55:39] <Cork> instead of blanker removing events
[08:55:50] <TimLoal> yes its a natural pair with on
[08:56:02] <TimLoal> but can also be selective
[08:56:19] <Cork> TimLoal: it is what the fiddle i made is
[08:56:25] <Cork> TimLoal: you might want to have a look at that one too
[08:56:46] <Cork> it has a semantic you might not know about
[08:57:56] <Justice> hm i'we read about the classes ".myevents" but never used them maybe i should start =)
[08:58:09] <Cork> it isn't a class
[08:58:19] <Cork> its a event namespace
[08:58:21] <TimLoal> ohh err misses that is funky
[08:58:24] <Justice> bad wording but^
[08:58:37] <TimLoal> nice juggeling
[09:00:08] <TimLoal> i doubt i'd ever need to drive like that, but nice example
[09:00:54] <TimLoal> ohh its not doing quite what i thought
[09:02:37] <TimLoal> i thought you were swapping events each time, which would have been too funky for me, unless really needed
[09:04:42] <TimLoal> yes i do like the myevents.  creating and consuming events is a next step
[09:06:01] <Justice> yeah =)
[09:06:52] <Justice> I have to get my fingers and start using that with promises and closuers and prototypes
[09:07:37] <TimLoal> it'll be well worth it
[09:10:53] <z1haze_work> Good morning, does anyone use a fancy select plugin to style select boxes? We are using selectric, but I have a request that they only want to show the selectric inputs on desktop, but on tablet, and mobile devices they want the native selects.. is this even possible? Because I know that selectric wraps the elements and puts dives around them, etc
[09:16:09] <Velveeta_> z1haze_work: it's totally possible, just don't initialize them on smaller form factors (or however you want to determine that you're on a tablet and below)
[09:23:40] <z1haze_work> that would be find in a perfect world yes
[09:23:50] <z1haze_work> but these people like to see the changes resizing the browser etc
[09:23:56] <z1haze_work> and they only want it on specific pages
[09:27:13] <Velveeta> well then you would have to use a window resize event to occasionally poll the size of the window, and at certain breakpoints, either instantiate it, or destroy it.. i'm assuming it has a destroy type of method
[09:37:43] <Cork> z1haze_work: the simplest solution is to use mediaquery
[09:38:00] <Cork> then you can get an event when the page goes smaller then a specific size
[09:38:57] <z1haze_work> for js?
[09:42:10] <Cork> yes
[09:42:51] <Cork> z1haze_work: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Testing_media_queries
[09:43:06] <Cork> you want the event solution, not the if case
[09:43:33] <Cork> so https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Testing_media_queries#Receiving_query_notifications
[09:44:21] <shoky> nifty
[09:44:36] <Cork> ya it's nice
[10:14:20] <Justice> wow firefox still does not support focusout ?
[10:18:51] <Cork> Justice: the problem is focusout is a webkit event
[10:19:01] <Cork> Justice: and the spec and browser implementations differ
[10:19:12] <Cork> so they have to research what is web compatible to implement
[10:19:22] <Cork> they've been at it for quite some time
[10:20:22] <Cork> "Judging from https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36266 it looks like webkit just implemented focusin/focusout as if they were renamed versions of DOMFocusIn/DOMFocusOut and that seems to be how they behave in Safari/Chrome, meaning that they are only useful over focus/blur because they bubble.
[10:20:22] <Cork> IE has always implemented focusin/focusout as firing before focus shifts, which is the behaviour the spec is based on, and I think what this patch is doing."
[10:21:40] <Justice> Cork: yeah i was reading that. going at it since 2011
[10:22:28] <Cork> ya, i know
[10:22:43] <Cork> they had a big problem caused by ie and webkit differing
[10:22:50] <Justice> yup
[10:23:03] <Cork> and why following specs are so important
[10:23:15] <Cork> this is a good example of what happens when a vendor doesn't
[10:23:29] <Justice> I think we all remember ie6 :P
[10:23:42] <Cork> well ie6 wasn't the source
[10:23:45] <Cork> ie4 was
[10:24:07] <Cork> from ie4 microsoft tried to create a forked ie only (basically) web
[10:24:25] <Cork> and ie5 was around when microsoft won
[10:24:39] <Cork> and ie6 was the proof that competition is important
[10:24:58] <Justice> indeed
[10:27:08] <Justice> what is the oposite to blur if firefox does not support focusout/in?
[10:27:19] <Justice> what's*
[10:27:47] <Cork> focus?
[10:27:49] <Justice> nwm... foucs :P
[10:27:50] <Cork> :)
[10:27:53] <Justice> haha
[10:28:07] <Cork> also jquery adds compatibility code for focusout/in
[10:28:17] <Cork> so those should work in firefox too
[10:30:15] <Justice> hm bit confused that its not focusIn/Out like fadeIn/Out
[10:30:24] <Justice> well not confused but...
[10:30:47] <Cork> events isn't camelcase
[10:30:49] <Cork> never has been
[10:30:56] <Justice> oh
[10:31:26] <Cork> mouseover, keydown, keyup..
[10:31:38] <Cork> not mouseOver keyDown, keyUp :)
[10:31:59] <Justice> hm true
[10:33:38] <Justice> how do you dynamicaly use .focusin() ? with on you can bind $(document).on('focusin', 'selector', func(){});
[10:34:07] <Cork> Justice: you can't
[10:34:16] <Cork> also i don't think focusin exists as a method
[10:34:33] <Cork> those are just helper functions that translate to .on(event, func)
[10:34:54] <Cork> and hopefully they get removed in not too far into the future
[10:35:26] <Cork> they are a legacy from very VERY early jquery
[10:35:34] <Justice> I see
[10:35:50] <Cork> if i remember correctly the beginning didn't have .bind
[10:35:58] <Justice> bit sad though that .on('ready') is removed in 3.x
[10:36:03] <Cork> but ya... that was a bit too long ago for me to be sure :)
[10:36:12] <Cork> Justice: why?
[10:36:17] <Cork> it was just a bad idea
[10:36:36] <Justice> just like the syntax more over .ready(func)
[10:36:46] <Cork> .ready is removed too
[10:36:55] <Justice> no?
[10:36:57] <Cork> the syntax 3.x uses is $(function() {})
[10:37:05] <Cork> it is the only supported one
[10:37:25] <Justice> you sure? I'm using 3.x migrate plugin with 3.1 jquery and switched to .ready
[10:38:18] <Justice> the warnings.md on github says to use .ready instead
[10:38:20] <Justice> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/warnings.md
[10:38:26] <Cork> "Deprecated: document-ready handlers other than jQuery(function)"
[10:38:44] <Cork> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#deprecated-document-ready-handlers-other-than-jquery-function
[10:39:06] <Cork> so sure, they work in 3, but they are marked for removal
[10:39:20] <Justice> odd that it adds those as a solution
[10:39:33] <Cork> i agree
[10:39:43] <Cork> file a bug towards the migration plugin
[10:41:14] <Justice> hm will do
[10:44:31] <Justice> man i forgett markdown every 6 months or so... must use github more.
[10:44:40] <Cork> lol
[10:49:17] <Justice> good markdown in bugreports is win :P
[11:10:17] <TimLoal> I'm just looking at versioning, I'm currently on 1.x, but reading about 3 I may as well step-up-to-date
[11:11:00] <andywww> why can i not call a callback sent as a parameter with data returned from an ajax call?
[11:11:02] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b7c5a45d9ae31c684e6106170b3b90ef
[11:11:04] <TimLoal> whats the current state of 3.x and what do you advise on using it
[11:11:28] <andywww> notably lines 9 and 27
[11:13:57] <TimLoal> 3.x compatability obviously
[11:14:06] <Velveeta> andywww: line 27 is invoking that callback at the time it's assigning it to the success property's value, so data doesn't exist yet
[11:14:37] <Velveeta> line 9 is assigning an uncalled function to the value of the success property, which is invoked at the time the response completes, and passed the data from the response, which it can then forward on to the callback
[11:16:34] <TimLoal> also is good 3.x code also good 1/2.x code?
[11:23:43] <TimLoal> do you use jQuery 3.x? y/n
[11:24:22] <z1haze_work> Have a crazy issue with only ie on a particular page: http://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site/default/MarcMag-Landing?fdid=marcmag the article images and layout is all goofed up for the lower articles, but works fine on all other browsers, any ideas?
[11:25:38] <z1haze_work> weird it made the link shorter http://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site/default/MarcMag-Landing?fdid=marcmag
[11:26:32] <z1haze_work> d=marcmag is missing from that url  not sure why that happened
[11:33:11] <guzzlefry> I'm trying to run `grunt build:js` for jquery-mobile but getting >> Error: Cannot find module 'cheerio'. Any ideas? I've installed cheerio via `npm install -g cheerio`.
[11:44:28] <TimLoal> in the absence of better info, i'm gonna move to 3.x compatability
[11:45:59] <TimLoal> brb
[12:14:13] <FeersumEndjinn> Q:  What is the correct/best method to set an 'a class' to "active" using jQuery?  https://dpaste.de/tCL8
[12:14:35] <ZoiX> FeersumEndjinn: In my opinion, addClass()
[12:14:51] <Velveeta> i concur with the good dr. zoix
[12:16:09] <FeersumEndjinn> ZoiX / Velveeta, I'm using django and admittedly my JS/jquery knowledge is very limited.  Is it better to add an onclick event for each URL calling a jquery function?
[12:16:24] <robertbusy> just need .on()
[12:16:28] <NaN_> I'm creating a team to aquire a team licence for a react video serie tutorials (with author permission), any interested msg me
[12:21:30] <robertbusy> lol
[12:40:12] <taplar> day to for the react license request, eh?
[12:40:15] <taplar> two
[13:08:28] <Darren_> http://www.ankitdesigns.com/demo/itn-quotegen/public/ when you use the country dropdown, how come the selection disappears when you select on something? The login is jane/smith
[13:08:45] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ any reason you can't make a standalone test case?
[13:09:18] <Darren_> ahhh i'm trying to help a co-worker debug it, he set it up like that
[13:10:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the best way to get help is to create a reduced test case: http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[13:10:24] <robertmaxrees> needing us to login to a private site and making us dig through all the code takes a while.
[13:10:28] <taplar> looks like angular
[13:10:45] <Darren_> ya it is angular
[13:10:58] <robertmaxrees> oh-
[13:11:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd head to #angularjs
[13:11:10] <Darren_> but the dropdown is select2, I thought it being jquery this would be the spot to go
[13:13:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd make a reduced test case for this.
[14:00:35] <MassDebates> So if I have multiple, separate property arrays I'm referencing in the same context file for 2 different scripts within an HTML file, each using a built-in helper (#each), Do I need a comma between them?
[14:00:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:01:13] <taplar> #each sounds like handlebars or such templating
[14:02:03] <taplar> #templatingrules #notjquery
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> "property arrays" is where i'm lost.
[14:08:58] <taplar> #dontmeantodiscourage #pleasecontinue
[14:09:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:09:33] <Uhkis> i bet none of those channels exist!
[14:12:21] <taplar> i should start a #itbrotha
[14:12:55] <arc_> that multiple 'hashtag' thing drives me crazy
[14:13:00] <arc_> instagram is the worst
[14:13:26] <taplar> what's that?  (is a social media recluse)
[14:13:28] <robertmaxrees> why instagram?
[14:13:37] <robertmaxrees> twitter was the one that popularized the idea.
[14:13:42] <arc_> because instagram culture includes putting like 15 hashtags on a photo
[14:13:54] <taplar> ah, lol
[14:14:07] <taplar> attribution at it's finest
[14:16:07] <robertmaxrees> i actually know one of the earliest dengineers from instagram.
[14:16:15] <robertmaxrees> errm, *engineers
[14:16:20] <arc_> it probably wasn't his/her fault that people do that :p
[14:16:28] <robertmaxrees> nope.  not his at all.
[14:16:38] <robertmaxrees> interesting dude though.
[14:16:58] <taplar> he likes the hash?
[14:17:05] <taplar> yeah, i went there
[14:17:09] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:17:16] <arc_> like this for example https://www.instagram.com/p/BIjbHTdj9J4/
[14:17:50] <robertmaxrees> heh, i use quite a few for a series of videos i do.
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> gotta get discoverable.
[14:18:17] <arc_> on youtube? they're tags right?
[14:18:30] <robertmaxrees> nah instagram
[14:18:33] <arc_> oh
[14:19:28] <arc_> well it's worse when people just write half the commentary on the photo in hashtags
[14:19:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah - it can be really annoying.
[14:19:52] <taplar> #paris #summer #greattime
[14:20:16] <taplar> err, would it be @paris ?  dunno the difference
[14:20:21] <robertmaxrees> #paris
[14:20:27] <robertmaxrees> #hashtag vs @account
[14:20:29] <arc_> like this for example https://www.instagram.com/p/BJFZhmtjItZ/
[14:20:31] <taplar> ah
[14:40:09] <MassDebates> sorry about the confusion taplar and robertmaxrees I got dragged away from the desk at an inconvenient moment
[14:40:32] <MassDebates> (but not pinging you specifically to ask about something. Just owed you an apology!)
[14:42:50] <taplar> rude
[14:42:52] <taplar> lol
[14:42:55] <taplar> sorry
[14:43:45] <MassDebates> hello #jquery - I've got multiple, separate arrays, each of objects and I'm trying to figure out the correct convention for the context file.
[14:44:40] <MassDebates> I have 1 HTML file with 2 {{ #each }} helper blocks in there, each (no pun intended) pulling from its respective array of objects.
[14:44:48] <decx> i know some of these words
[14:44:58] <MassDebates> here's a pastery to show you
[14:45:28] <shoky> btw {{ #each }} is not HTML  :p
[14:47:08] <MassDebates> Oh, Sorry, I should have restated that I'm working with handlebars. I forgot that there was a long delay between my msgs
[14:53:03] <MassDebates> okay, there we go
[14:53:03] <MassDebates> https://www.pastery.net/wzphbh/
[14:53:49] <MassDebates> So that pastery includes two things: a template and some context (handlebars)
[14:54:36] <taplar> so.... what is the question related to jquery?
[14:55:53] <MassDebates> I figured that since #handlebars has been dead for a long time that #jquery would be the most reasonable fallback.
[14:56:34] <MassDebates> I know it doesn't require jquery but the two are often used together that it made sense.
[14:57:02] <taplar> your grasping, :)
[14:57:07] <MassDebates> much like #scss isn't exactly #css because it's a preprocessor but I still help people in #css with #scss questions.
[14:58:03] <MassDebates> taplar:  where should I go?
[14:58:57] <taplar> if #handlebars is dead, i mean you can ask here.  just be aware that you may not get a response here
[14:59:09] <decx> dont do your each in your template
[14:59:12] <MassDebates> I'm looking to figure out the proper convention for including 2 arrays of objects in my context, not just one.
[14:59:27] <decx> just loop through your array and template(data)
[14:59:53] <MassDebates> what do you mean decx
[15:00:03] <decx> dont do your each in your template
[15:00:04] <decx> just loop through your array and template(data)
[15:00:55] <pamsny> #babel
[15:18:26] <MassDebates> I'm back, sorry, I think my whole office lost internet for a moment. Weird.
[15:23:04] <taplar> MassDebates: can you create a fiddle with your issue?
[15:23:30] <MassDebates> sure thing
[15:24:08] <MassDebates> er, anyone got that pastery link I recently put up?
[15:24:32] <taplar> https://www.pastery.net/wzphbh/
[15:39:59] <lucas_ai_> when I do $("a") in the console, I'm getting a DOM element instead of a jQuery object. Why?
[15:40:06] <MassDebates> Figured it out.
[15:40:06] <MassDebates> Had a frigging typo with one of the arrays
[15:40:21] <MassDebates> because "a" is a DOM element
[15:40:26] <taplar> console.log($.fn.version)
[15:40:56] <lucas_ai_> VM1307:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'version' of undefined(…)
[15:40:57] <taplar> it maybe that $ is not referencing jQuery and your in chrome
[15:41:00] <MassDebates> if you're looking to just get an object in the dom
[15:41:00] <MassDebates> you could do something like this:
[15:41:05] <lucas_ai_> what is it otherwise?
[15:41:19] <taplar> chrome makes $ be document.querySelectorAll or something
[15:41:26] <taplar> if you don't have jquery
[15:42:05] <MassDebates> You could do "a = {}" and then do "$(a)" (no quotes)
[15:42:05] <MassDebates> Then you have an object do reference. Doing $(s) without a = {} beforehand will simply tell you it's not an object
[15:42:05] <MassDebates> er something like that.
[15:42:22] <MassDebates> Or maybe it's not defined. idk lol
[15:43:29] <lucas_ai_> I had jQuery before. Hmm... how do I get jquery on the console then?
[15:44:42] <taplar> oh i had it wrong
[15:44:43] <taplar> console.log($.fn.jquery);
[15:44:48] <taplar> what does that print?
[15:47:48] <lucas_ai_> VM2402:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined(…)4
[15:48:03] <taplar> ok, what if you do it with 'jQuery' instead of '$' ?
[15:51:06] <lucas_ai_> jQuery.fn.jquery
[15:51:06] <lucas_ai_> "1.6.2"
[15:51:19] <taplar> alright, so your running jQuery in no conflict mode
[15:51:47] <taplar> you'll either have to reference it by jQuery, or wrap your code in an IIFE and pass jQuery in, and accept it as $ so you can use $ inside
[15:54:56] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/w6u0td4v/1/
[15:55:15] <NaN_> I'm creating a team to aquire a team licence for a react videos serie tutorials, any interested msg me
[15:59:36] <robertmaxrees> NaN_ might look elsewhere to solicit for that.
[16:08:39] <TimCoal> robertmaxrees i think its a bot, always the same single message
[16:08:51] <robertmaxrees> nah.  there are variations on the message.
[16:08:58] <lucas_ai_> What's the best way to make automation scripts/macros on Chrome? Is there a great extension? I rather work mostly with code but I'd love to be able to record and have some code created too.
[16:09:03] <robertmaxrees> not uncommon to get people doing that kinda stuff though.
[16:09:13] <taplar> tampermonkey?
[16:09:33] <MassDebates> What did you just call me??!
[16:09:46] <taplar> the mass debater
[16:09:56] <MassDebates> how rude
[16:09:56] <robertmaxrees> lucas_ai_ i can't think of anything that'll create code - are you just looking to automate stuff?
[16:10:02] <Velveeta> massdebates is one of the greatest nicks i've seen
[16:10:21] <taplar> can't beat the fake cheese nick
[16:10:36] <robertmaxrees> lucas_ai_ if so, then yeah you just want tampermonkey.
[16:11:33] <lucas_ai_> robertmaxrees, yes, but I prefer code so that I can use variables, loops, copy text from one page and insert it in another, etc. Ideas?
[16:11:43] <robertmaxrees> tampermonkey is what you want for that.
[16:12:00] <robertmaxrees> though it doesn't do the "record and generate" you're looking for.
[16:19:53] <MassDebates> thanks Velveeta ! I came up with it myself.
[16:19:53] <MassDebates> I am the Original MassDebates.
[16:20:48] <Velveeta> :D
[16:23:21] <taplar> THE original.  Hand to head...err.... heart
[16:26:21] <NaN_> robertmaxrees: am I breaking some channel rules?
[16:26:43] <taplar> it's just odd to request something related to react in a jquery channel
[16:26:46] <taplar> repeatedly
[16:27:45] <robertmaxrees> it's also completely offtopic.
[16:27:55] <NaN_> got it... I will not request anymore in here
[16:27:57] <NaN_> sorry guys
[16:28:18] <robertmaxrees> like, OT stuff is okayish, but you're soliciting to get a bunch of people together to pay money for a different library.
[16:28:19] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[16:28:29] <robertmaxrees> *pay money for tutorials.  either way.
[16:28:52] <NaN> :c
[16:28:55] <NaN> OT stuff?
[16:29:00] <robertmaxrees> off topic
[16:29:42] <NaN> well in react defence, it play well with jquery :B
[16:30:05] <taplar> so does html, and css, and less
[16:30:34] <robertmaxrees> heh, not saying we don't play well, but this IS a jquery support channel :) it's all good.  just letting you know.
[16:30:55] <NaN> c:
[16:31:14] <MassDebates> NaN:  It's a general faux-pa to solicit in a support channel that's only loosely related by contextual languages involved.
[16:31:28] <robertmaxrees> heh i think he gets the message :)
[16:31:33] <robertmaxrees> anyway!
[16:31:37] <MassDebates> NaN:  It's also very commonly known and understood amongst an overwhelming majority of users with your experience on IRC and support channels.
[16:31:57] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates some places are a bit more lax about those rules to be fair,
[16:32:32] <MassDebates> That's fine and all, but I wouldn't have said what I've said if he wasn't caught doing the same crap in #wordpress.
[16:32:46] <MassDebates> I'm not confident in saying more than once, but at least once.
[16:32:56] <MassDebates> Now that I think about it, I think it was #css
[16:33:09] <robertmaxrees> sooo - let's go ahead and drop it.  it's under control and it's fine :)
[16:33:21] <NaN> easy MassDebates, I get the message
[16:33:33] <NaN> :/
[16:34:20] <taplar> i think were missing the bigger issue here
[16:34:29] <NaN> to clean my fault I will try to help (with what I know) in here
[16:34:31] <taplar> if they are NaN, wtf are they?
[16:34:53] <robertmaxrees> taplar that's the only thing we DO know about NaN - they're not a number.
[16:34:54] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:35:00] <robertmaxrees> NaN nah it's all good.  you're being cool about it.
[16:35:03] <taplar> true dat
[16:45:30] <NaN> taplar: My specie (NaN) are a rare Grakkareon specie formed by a combination of life-forms to make up a single individual
[16:46:07] <taplar> borg
[16:46:09] <NaN> taplar: so we are many but one at the same time, so we are not a number
[16:46:11] <NaN> haha
[16:46:12] <taplar> fking borg
[16:46:15] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[16:47:17] <NaN> but we are organic 100%
[17:12:03] <taplar> but are you free ranged?
[17:12:13] <taplar> no preservatives
[17:13:33] <taplar> i'm not hungry, just curious
[18:13:16] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[18:32:55] <taplar> lol, give me another one after this next statement
[18:33:08] <taplar> Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded bride?
[18:48:33] <taplar> the bride cries at the alter
[18:50:59] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:57:26] <kegster> if i append an <embed src="" type="application/pdf"> to the body of an html doc--- how can i detect if the PDF got loaded completely? i'm having an issue where when i load an iframe with an html doc that just creates an embed--- the pdf shows like 95% of the time, but 5-10% of the time, the PDF doesn't show
[18:57:27] <kegster> ant ideas?
[18:59:12] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/19140727
[19:03:00] <kegster> is there a reason the PDF only sometime shos?
[19:03:11] <kegster> robertmaxrees, thanks by the way :D sorry i stepped away for a moment heh
[19:03:14] <kegster> shows***
[19:11:54] <robertmaxrees> kegster i have literally no idea.
[19:12:00] <robertmaxrees> are you getting 404s or something?
[19:12:05] <robertmaxrees> i thought that's what you were trying to solve for.
[19:12:07] <kegster> nah. just doesn't show
[19:12:12] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.
[19:12:14] <kegster> yeah
[19:12:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it break.
[19:12:30] <robertmaxrees> that load event may or may not help then.
[19:12:42] <kegster> well, i'm going to reload if failed (if i can on failure)
[19:13:14] <kegster> can i add listener on 'error' ?
[19:13:29] <robertmaxrees> i don't think it'll throw an error heh
[19:13:38] <kegster> i was afraid :P
[19:13:46] <kegster> it seems if i do a page reload, it fixes it
[19:13:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd look into fixing the whole not showing initially part.
[19:13:54] <kegster> yaeh
[19:13:59] <kegster> it shows almost everytime. strange
[19:14:15] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a race condition against the network.
[19:34:44] <kegster> robertmaxrees, what do you mean by race condition against the network?
[19:34:59] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like it works fine when it's cached.
[19:35:08] <kegster> well, it works when not cached too
[19:35:20] <robertmaxrees> i thought you said on first hit of the page it usually doesn't work.
[19:35:39] <kegster> it shows 95% of the time, just in general
[19:35:42] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[19:35:59] <kegster> whether first load OR after i've removed/re-appended an embed (there's a prev/next feature to chnge the pdf)
[19:36:28] <robertmaxrees> aaaah - i was incorrectly extrapolating off "well, i'm going to reload if failed (if i can on failure)"
[19:36:39] <robertmaxrees> that explains it.
[20:11:04] <kegster> yeah been digging around to no avail :P
[20:11:13] <kegster> i'll come back to it after i let it rest a bit
[20:13:46] <NaN> c'ya guys
[23:30:57] <FishPencil> Are we to the point yet where best practice doesn't dictate a backup plan for JS disabled users? Google, and many others don't provide a fallback.
