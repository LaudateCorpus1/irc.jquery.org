[00:44:20] <Cork> Starship8015: javascript can't target psudo elements
[00:44:35] <Cork> Starship8015: i would recommend adding the rule to css and add a class in js
[00:44:52] <Starship8015> oops, just realize i posted in the wrong channel
[00:44:54] <Starship8015> i am sorry :)
[04:28:15] <sine`> morning folks. so to carry on from the other day, in order to change some events after a single trick such as a click, you have to use queue
[04:28:39] <sine`> and sorry i mean *chain events*
[04:28:52] <Cork> uh, what?
[04:29:01] <Cork> what does queue have to do with events?
[04:29:51] <sine`> So i click a button, I want it to then be disabled from clicking but then 3 seconds later it be reenabled again, that would require the queue right?
[04:30:18] <sine`> im trying to work out that all delayed events with multiple things happening after time would require queue
[04:30:19] <Cork> that would just require a setTimeout
[04:30:38] <Cork> setTimeout(function() { self.disabled = false; }, 3000);
[05:19:29] <CuirPork> How do I ensure that jquery is set to use $
[05:19:52] <Cork> CuirPork: jquery doesn't use it
[05:20:03] <Cork> if you mean you want to make sure $ is jquery check $.fn.version
[05:22:10] <CuirPork> can you be more specific by "check" I get cannot read property 'fn' of undefined.
[05:23:26] <Cork> CuirPork: if $.fn is undefined it isn't jquery
[05:23:46] <Cork> $.fn.version would be the version number of the jquery version you're using
[05:23:50] <CuirPork> lol, thanks.how do I make it jquery
[05:23:57] <Cork> if you can't access it then it isn't
[05:24:15] <CuirPork> i would like it to be
[05:24:40] <Cork> well you can just do $ = jQuery
[05:24:47] <Cork> $ is just a variable
[05:24:57] <Cork> you migt want to scope the code though
[05:25:10] <Cork> as the rest of the page most likely expects it to be the other lib
[05:25:38] <Cork> (function($) { /* your code goes here, and $ is jQuery */ })(jQuery);
[05:27:57] <CuirPork> beautiful, thanks.
[10:54:43] <gr0undh0g> So it's possible I might be screwed, that original author of the page may have called stopPropagation?
[10:55:12] <gr0undh0g> I might create a throw away account at dynalist.io so others can see the mess it is
[10:56:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:56:16] <Cork> gr0undh0g: if an event handler uses stopPropagation or stopImidiatePropagation you can't access the event ya
[10:56:47] <gr0undh0g> morning
[11:02:03] <gr0undh0g> can "document" be used as a selector?
[11:02:13] <Cork> $(document)
[11:02:31] <Cork> but no it isn't an element, just a global variable
[11:03:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:03:54] <gr0undh0g> So I think that worked:   $(document).on( "click", ".needsclick", function( event ) {
[11:04:10] <robertmaxrees> then there is no stopPropagtation call :)
[11:04:35] <gr0undh0g> I had to go out to the whole document and delegate because all of it is dynamic
[11:04:39] <gr0undh0g> yup :)
[11:04:51] <robertmaxrees> pretty common
[11:05:00] <Cork> ya
[11:05:24] <gr0undh0g> thanks for the breadcrumbs :)
[17:14:09] <paule32> hello
[17:14:21] <paule32> have problem with:   https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/b5xsoz4h/11/
[17:14:35] <paule32> i can switch from standard to advance
[17:14:40] <paule32> but not back
[17:27:37] <paule32> hello?
[17:28:01] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon!
[17:28:07] <paule32> n
[17:28:10] <paule32> hi
[17:31:19] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:44:52] <robertmaxrees> welp
[17:44:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:21:57] <paule32> hello robertmaxrees
[18:22:19] <paule32> you are in many channels?
[18:22:19] <robertmaxrees> how can i help you?
[18:22:20] <paule32> :D
[18:22:37] <paule32> ehm
[18:22:41] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/b5xsoz4h/11/
[18:23:10] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/XWV5sBC.png you're including jquery and jquery ui twice there.
[18:23:12] <robertmaxrees> pick one.
[18:23:13] <paule32> i can switch to "additional", but then, not back to "standard"
[18:23:15] <robertmaxrees> of each :)
[18:24:53] <paule32> it is
[18:25:20] <robertmaxrees> you're repeating them.
[18:25:23] <robertmaxrees> fix that first.
[18:26:11] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/5ONEXZ9.png
[18:28:15] <robertmaxrees> your second issue is you're doing some weird stuff with that extra function.  hositing and whatnot are likely biting you.
[18:29:49] <robertmaxrees> so why aren't you using normal jquery ui tabs?
[18:31:41] <paule32> can you provide a sample ?
[18:32:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[18:32:50] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/Ft8Vc9T.png
[18:33:05] <paule32> hehe
[18:33:10] <paule32> thanks
[20:50:30] <paule32> hello
[20:50:53] <paule32> is it possible to get the object under the mouse, by right click?
[21:02:47] <pavonia> You mean the element the click event was triggered on?
[21:04:54] <paule32> something always
[21:05:06] <paule32> little bit twisted atm
