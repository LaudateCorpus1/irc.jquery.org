[02:30:13] <beshoo> i want to support 2 touchend and mouseup in the same div , i used :
[02:30:19] <beshoo> $(".globalbody").on("touchend mouseup", ".search_hashtag_button", function(e) {
[02:30:28] <beshoo> but Chrome fire 2 time
[02:30:35] <beshoo> how can i do this correctly ?
[02:31:10] <Woet> beshoo: share your test case on www.jsfiddle.net
[02:34:22] <beshoo> https://jsfiddle.net/4fr6umwx/
[02:34:40] <beshoo> run in mobile mode
[02:35:50] <beshoo> why in mobile it fire 2 times
[02:35:55] <Woet> beshoo: did you try event.preventDefault();?
[02:36:37] <beshoo> Please kindly may you show me how
[02:39:45] <beshoo> SOLVED
[02:39:47] <beshoo> thank you
[02:40:16] <beshoo> do i have to add e.preventDefault()
[02:40:27] <beshoo> after all events
[02:40:28] <beshoo> ?
[02:40:37] <Woet> if you want to prevent the default, yes.
[02:40:56] <beshoo> what the meaning of default
[02:41:13] <beshoo> in disktop mode it does only one !
[02:41:17] <beshoo> just in mobile
[02:41:23] <beshoo> so what is going on ?
[02:48:08] <beshoo> e.preventDefault(); works but some time it stop all functions
[02:48:23] <beshoo> so i need better way to do this globaly
[04:46:25] <devi8> Here is a wild one: I figured it would be easy to duplicate this animated gif using svg elements and jquery. I haven't been able to even get the grid right. https://twitter.com/i/status/859984258290659328
[12:53:01] <Rockwood> any active?
[12:53:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:53:11] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[12:54:34] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/7sdL4mqo/  i wanna change color
[12:55:09] <Rockwood> of values-data='16' text color just
[12:55:25] <Rockwood> maths
[12:55:47] <Rockwood> something like active on 16
[12:55:50] <Rockwood> maths
[12:56:04] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:56:13] <Rockwood> i am confuse
[12:56:34] <robertmaxrees> so am I lol.  why do you need to set an "active" class on that element?
[12:56:44] <robertmaxrees> why doesn't your server od that insteaD?
[12:58:02] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, https://kopy.io/YGNCc
[12:58:12] <Rockwood> i tried this but its not working
[12:58:50] <robertmaxrees> because you need to give the element that class.
[13:00:16] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood so really, you want to know how to select by data-value?
[13:06:39] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/h9n3k6ep/ robertmaxrees
[13:06:50] <Rockwood> something like this
[13:06:57] <robertmaxrees> ol
[13:07:00] <robertmaxrees> **lol
[13:07:08] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood so really, you want to know how to select by data-value?
[13:07:19] <robertmaxrees> or get an element with a particular data-value?
[13:07:49] <robertmaxrees> your first problem is that if($('.activesubject').data().value == 16){ doesn't make any sense :)
[13:08:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .filter() on $('.activesubject') and filter down to the one whose .data('value') === 16
[13:08:57] <Rockwood> i am confuse
[13:09:07] <Rockwood> hows?
[13:09:21] <robertmaxrees> start by reading http://api.jquery.com/filter/ :)
[13:10:05] <robertmaxrees> specifically, you want this version: http://api.jquery.com/filter/#filter-function
[13:16:46] <Rockwood> still not clear
[13:18:02] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried with .filter()?
[13:19:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/bpzn4ruh/
[13:19:22] <robertmaxrees> here, start with this.
[13:27:28] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/bpzn4ruh/1/
[13:28:09] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood so your issue is, firstly, $('.activesubject') is selecting everything with that class.
[13:28:17] <robertmaxrees> you want to use $(this) there instead.
[13:28:38] <robertmaxrees> also: .data().value() isn't a thing - you want .data('value')
[13:30:24] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/bpzn4ruh/3/
[13:30:56] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood againb
[13:30:58] <robertmaxrees> *again
[13:31:07] <robertmaxrees> $('activesubject') selects ALL elements with that class.
[13:31:19] <robertmaxrees> you want $(this) inside the filter instead.
[13:31:23] <trwww> I've some code that is bootstrapped with 'jQuery( document ).ready(function( $ ) {' but a better handler is 'jQuery(document).on('gform_post_render', function() {'
[13:31:26] <trwww> is doing 'var $ = jQuery;' okay, or do I have to go through the function and change each $ to jQuery?
[13:32:35] <Rockwood> okay better option why not replace class with new one on match value
[13:32:40] <Rockwood> how the idea?
[13:32:42] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood you're not listening.
[13:32:49] <Rockwood> okay
[13:33:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0nck8hg7/
[13:33:08] <robertmaxrees> that's all you had to do.
[13:44:55] <gambl0r3> hello?
[13:46:22] <robertmaxrees> trwww you can do var $ = jQuery.  should be fine.,
[13:46:50] <robertmaxrees> though i might figure out what's running noConflict mode and get rid of that instead.
[13:46:53] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood that make sense?
[13:47:08] <Rockwood> no
[13:47:29] <robertmaxrees> okay - where are you confused?
[13:47:34] <Rockwood> it's very nested solution
[13:47:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:47:55] <Rockwood> anyway thanks
[13:47:55] <robertmaxrees> it's filtering down to the elements you want and then setting a css property on them.
[13:48:09] <Rockwood> i understand and saved it
[13:48:26] <robertmaxrees> any reason you don't do that server-side though?
[13:48:31] <robertmaxrees> just set a class and move on?
[13:49:18] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, can i PM you?
[13:49:21] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:58:10] <Rockwood> got it? robertmaxrees
[13:58:15] <robertmaxrees> got what?
[13:58:21] <robertmaxrees> oh - i didn't look at the paste.
[13:58:22] <Rockwood>  if(response.question.question.subjectId) === response.quizCurrentSubjectId){
[13:58:48] <robertmaxrees> mind poppiong your question in here?
[14:00:04] <Rockwood> this is comes from question's subject -- response.question.question.subjectId
[14:00:26] <robertmaxrees> where's the "active subject nmame in nav"??
[14:00:30] <robertmaxrees> what element are you updating?
[14:01:30] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:01:56] <Rockwood> and this is quiz's current subject id -- response.quizCurrentSubjectId
[14:02:19] <robertmaxrees> that answers neither of my questions.,
[14:02:34] <robertmaxrees> what element should update?  and what are you updationg it do?
[14:02:43] <robertmaxrees> *updating it to
[14:04:06] <Rockwood> if question's subject id and list subject is matches
[14:04:23] <Rockwood> if question's subject id and list of subjects matches
[14:04:36] <Rockwood> in subjects id
[14:04:39] <robertmaxrees> still not answering my question.
[14:04:43] <robertmaxrees> what element do you want to update?
[14:05:13] <Rockwood>    <a data-value="{{$subjects['subjectId']}}" class="nav-link activesubject" href="#">
[14:05:14] <Rockwood>                             {{title_case($subjects['subjectName'])}}
[14:05:14] <Rockwood>                         </a>
[14:05:17] <Rockwood> this
[14:05:22] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[14:05:38] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you want to select the activesubject with a particular data-value?
[14:05:48] <Rockwood> yes
[14:06:21] <robertmaxrees> i've already shown you how to do that.
[14:06:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0nck8hg7/2/
[15:36:06] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[15:39:56] <mmmveggies> or https://jsfiddle.net/0nck8hg7/4/
[15:40:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid using attrbute selectors for data attributes imo.
[15:40:42] <robertmaxrees> but that's a thing you could do.
[15:40:54] <mmmveggies> hmm, why?
[15:42:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1375nrtu/
[15:43:21] <robertmaxrees> if you set the data attribute via .data(), you can't use it as apart of a selector.

[18:32:47] <jjrabbit> hello
[18:32:52] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[18:33:13] <jjrabbit> anybody know what front end framework john resig uses
[18:33:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:33:24] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:33:33] <jjrabbit> lol
[18:33:37] <robertmaxrees> probably picks the appropraite one for the project.
[18:33:42] <jjrabbit> i can't decide one which one to use so i want to know which one he uses
[18:33:50] <robertmaxrees> that's... kind of a silly question.
[18:34:04] <jjrabbit> hm, maybe better suited for #jquery-social
[18:34:12] <robertmaxrees> not... really?
[18:34:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:34:18] <jjrabbit> doh
[18:34:25] <robertmaxrees> why don't you describe the application?
[18:34:32] <robertmaxrees> what problems do you need to solve?
[18:35:03] <jjrabbit> well, nothing atm but everybody is on the framework train and i feel like i'm at a point where it's time to hop on
[18:35:06] <robertmaxrees> just because someone uses a particular library or framework doesn't mean you should
[18:35:27] <robertmaxrees> for instance, i use a lot of backbone, but i certainly wouldn't reccommend it.
[18:35:34] <c_bluntish> hello
[18:35:46] <robertmaxrees> jjrabbit ah, yeah - find a problem before you look for a tool.
[18:35:48] <c_bluntish> how can I make something show on click then hide on second click
[18:36:16] <c_bluntish> toggle seems to mess up its display
[18:36:16] <robertmaxrees> c_bluntish depends on the use case.
[18:36:20] <jjrabbit> robertmaxrees: i got this
[18:36:21] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/ is one way.
[18:36:22] <c_bluntish> hi
[18:36:34] <jjrabbit> c_bluntish: oops nevermind i was going to say toggle lol
[18:36:36] <robertmaxrees> i'd toggle the class instace.
[18:36:42] <robertmaxrees> *class instead
[18:37:19] <jjrabbit> robertmaxrees: ok that's a good point i shouldn't use a framework just for the sake of using a framework
[18:37:28] <robertmaxrees> ^ and you shouldnm'
[18:37:45] <jjrabbit> robertmaxrees: but i met this one vue.js dev and he said the reason to use frameworks is because if you just use a library like jquery then you end up with spaghetti code
[18:37:47] <robertmaxrees> *shouldn't use a particular framework just because somebody uses iot.
[18:37:58] <jjrabbit> what would you say to him
[18:38:08] <robertmaxrees> jjrabbit you're conflating things :)
[18:38:12] <robertmaxrees> i never said "don'
[18:38:25] <robertmaxrees> fff - *i never said "don't use a framework"
[18:38:46] <jjrabbit> yea i got that
[18:38:58] <robertmaxrees> just use the appropriate tool for the job.
[18:39:09] <robertmaxrees> maybe that's react, or riot, or vue, or angular (ew)
[18:39:15] <Buoy172> I want to know what backend John Resig uses
[18:39:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:39:39] <robertmaxrees> equally irrelevant ;)
[18:39:59] <jjrabbit> we should send him some fan mail and ask him
[18:40:07] <Buoy172> hey John Resig is the law
[18:40:24] <robertmaxrees> lol what's with this recent surge in interest about resig?  he's a great dude and all, but...
[18:40:25] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:40:37] <jjrabbit> he's the one
[18:40:44] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[18:41:02] <jjrabbit> alright back to coding :)
[18:41:08] <Buoy172> lol
[18:41:41] <Buoy172> I hadn't heard of him before jjrabbit mentioned him
[18:41:50] <Buoy172> and I use a lot fo jQuery
[18:42:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:42:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, he left the project long ago.
[18:42:41] <Buoy172> What's he doing now?
[18:43:24] <robertmaxrees> He works at Khan academy last I heard.
[18:43:31] <robertmaxrees> https://johnresig.com/about/
[18:44:32] <Buoy172> At first glance I thought he was gay I misread Nell as Neil
[18:45:02] <robertmaxrees> o...kay?
[18:45:30] <Buoy172> then I clicked the link and saw her
[18:45:48] <robertmaxrees> still confused abou what his orientation has to do with anything (shrug)
[18:46:06] <Buoy172> nothing I'm just saying what I thought
[18:49:23] <c_bluntish> wow that was painfull
[18:49:26] <c_bluntish> done :)
[18:49:30] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:49:39] <robertmaxrees> oh the class toggle?
[18:49:41] <c_bluntish> thanks to Buoy172 and robertmaxrees past present help
[18:49:54] <c_bluntish> it woouldnt work the way I wanted to
[18:50:03] <robertmaxrees> what was the fix?
[18:50:23] <c_bluntish> so I used some data attributes, set the parent data-show to 0 or 1 on view
[18:50:30] <robertmaxrees> :/
[18:50:43] <c_bluntish> worked
[18:50:48] <robertmaxrees> ah letting the data element hold state you mean?
[18:50:52] <c_bluntish> yes
[18:50:55] <c_bluntish> :)
[18:50:56] <robertmaxrees> fair.
[18:51:04] <c_bluntish> you showed me that a few weeks ago
[18:51:09] <robertmaxrees> yar.

[18:51:13] <robertmaxrees> one way to do it.
