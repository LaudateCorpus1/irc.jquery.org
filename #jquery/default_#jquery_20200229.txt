[12:54:23] <thloser> Hello! im using, split to explode ":" from this line of text RCVD: :thloser!ThLoser@this.is.it PRIVMSG #wcket :What is this: doch - Im getting the line "What is this" but i need the hole line there "What is this: doch" because of the ":" he splits that aswell, how to make it so i get the hole text instead? Im sorry for this shitty question and shitty explanation im not really good at asking
[12:54:23] <thloser> questions. Hope someone knows what im talking about
[13:04:21] <thloser> So in other words i dont want it to split after the third split
[13:17:41] <grid-> hey
[13:32:42] <pavonia> thloser: Use String.match() with a regex instead. Also note that this is a channel about jQuery
[13:40:10] <thloser> pavonia i should be in a javascript channel right?
[13:43:00] <pavonia> There's ##javascript for general JS problems
