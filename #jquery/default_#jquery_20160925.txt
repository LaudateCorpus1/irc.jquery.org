[00:39:30] <DexDeadly> So I got a question.  I'm programming a dashboard for my home.  I'm wondering if jquery would give me the best option here.  I have a file I created that pulls Kodi data.  However I want to use this same file for multiple Kodi devices.  What I'd like to do is on the page have a variable or something on the page that labels it say livingroom.  I'd like to send that name to the kodi file, the
[00:39:30] <DexDeadly> Kodi file then would query my database to pull the IP and port.
[00:40:31] <DexDeadly> Then in that Kodi file based off certain information it'll echo back the format.  I'd like to take that rendered HTML and place it into a div on the page.  Maybe just have the div labeled kodi.
[00:40:40] <DexDeadly> I want to do this all on load.

[09:31:42] <PlanC> I've got a pretty annoying ui problem
[09:31:51] <PlanC> I'm using slideDown/slideUp
[09:32:18] <PlanC> I have a section that I'm toggling the slide for and while it's sliding the margin of the element is removed
[09:32:31] <PlanC> and when the slide animation is complete the margin kicks in
[09:33:34] <PlanC> I've noticed that if I add the margin to the <section> itself it solves the problem and the margin's shown even during the slide
[09:34:02] <PlanC> but at the same time I don't want to have a margin for the entire <section> but only for a specific <div>
[15:10:40] <no_gravity> Hello! Do I see it correctly, that the non-jquery equivalent of $(".day").toggleClass("active) is this? Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName("day")).forEach(function (e) {e.classList.toggle("active") });

[15:41:28] <Royale_AJS> For some reason. I can't get a script to load in Drupal. I've got jQuery loading as the first script in <head> but I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function" in my console when I type 'var $menu = $(".dropdown-menu");'
[15:41:30] <Royale_AJS> Any ideas?
[15:50:04] <Royale_AJS> ??
[15:56:10] <shoky> Royale_AJS: CMS's like drupal tend to call jQuery.noConflict() making $ undefined. you should still be able to use `jQuery`.    and if you wanna use $ you can use an IIFE like  (function($) { ... })(jQuery)
[15:57:28] <Royale_AJS> Ok...newbie here...what changes would I make to the script?
[15:57:51] <shoky> (function($) { ... your code that uses $ here ... })(jQuery)
[15:58:33] <Royale_AJS> I took the js script at the bottom of this html doc (I'm making a shopping menu) https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim/blob/master/example/example.html
[15:58:54] <Royale_AJS> Starting on line 198
[16:01:08] <Royale_AJS> basically I took everything between <script> (line 198) to  and </script> (line 258) and embedded it into Drupal.

[19:00:06] <PlanC> what's the best way of making a horizontal tab change animation?
[19:00:37] <PlanC> I've checked out animate.css and I've tried to combine slideOutRight with slideInLeft
[19:00:58] <PlanC> but the tabs stack on top of each other when they're about to change and it just doesn't look good
[19:01:53] <PlanC> my next thought is to have all the tabs next to each other horizontally with overflow:hidden and then just slide to the left or right

[22:31:09] <Alturic> Hey guys, I have a group of elements all sharing the same common class (exampleclass). The id is unique to each element, however. I'm looking to addClass to this unique element (which I have working), and then if that same unique element is clicked again it removes the class, which is working as well, technically. However, if any other element is clicked (while an existing element hasClass) I
[22:31:09] <Alturic> don't want anything to happen, unless the existing single element with the "locked" class is clicked. So I'm currently doing a .on click event for the elemenet class, and inside of that I have an if saying if this hasClass remove it else add it. The problem is that since I'm using this is the if, it just keeps addClass'ing to anything that's clicked. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I
[22:31:09] <Alturic> can achieve this?
