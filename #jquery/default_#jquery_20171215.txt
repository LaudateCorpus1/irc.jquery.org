[04:22:18] <Guest8> hello
[04:22:47] <nikio_> hihi
[04:23:09] <Guest8> how are you
[04:39:04] <nikio_> im hackin
[04:39:06] <nikio_> u?
[05:49:55] <SesMan> hi, is it possible to call the former function defined for an event on a field when overriding this element ? something like : $('input').on('blur', function(event) { doThis();}; $('input.plok').on('blur', function(event) { parent(); doThatToo(); }
[05:56:43] <Cork> SesMan: you don't need to you don't replace the other event handlers you add another one
[05:57:23] <Cork> so just do your stuff and the other event handlers will handle there cases
[05:58:11] <SesMan> that's what I knew... but now I see what I was doing wrong: calling the wrong environment. -_- thanks anyway
[05:58:28] <thykka> SesMan, https://jsfiddle.net/9h9dqxem/
[06:09:55] <SesMan> nick trick, thykka
[06:09:57] <SesMan> thanks
[10:00:55] <Sal> hey guys, does jquery add style attrib to an div after calling ajax?
[10:01:54] <Sal> i have a strange thing going on here and i can't find whats wrong. After i call an ajax in GET, on return the main container of the data gets a style set
[10:02:37] <Sal> so i'm asking if jquery does this by itself for some reason
[10:03:20] <Sal> this is what iget added to the div after ajax caal: style="overflow-y: scroll; position: fixed; width: 100%; left: 0px; top: 0px; z-index: 102;"
[10:03:39] <Sal> any idea?
[10:03:58] <thykka> no, jQuery should not do that on it's own
[10:04:00] <shoky_> Sal: no jquery doesn't do that by itself
[10:04:34] <Sal> i also get it on a main container div, and the one where the result of the call goes
[10:04:54] <thykka> does the same thing happen in incognito mode?
[10:05:04] <Sal> let me try
[10:05:49] <Sal> yes
[10:06:16] <Sal> but let me think.... style can only be set by me or by js, right?
[10:06:30] <thykka> pretty much
[10:06:35] <Sal> so if its not in the original html, it means that its been inserted by js
[10:06:46] <thykka> have you tried searching for "overflow-y" in inspector?
[10:06:56] <Sal> but if i do a global search of "overflow-y", a can't find anything
[10:07:08] <Sal> :)
[10:07:09] <thykka> hmm
[10:07:18] <thykka> is the page online somewhere?
[10:07:44] <Sal> no
[10:07:50] <shoky_> could be some plugin you're including
[10:08:18] <Sal> but if it was, doing search it would find it
[10:08:42] <Sal> and why does it get added after the ajax call?
[10:08:58] <Sal> maybe because the html gets refreshed ?
[10:09:05] <shoky_> as you said, either its in the html, or some js is adding it :p
[10:09:10] <thykka> could be a mutation observer, but it still seems weird
[10:09:37] <thykka> would it be possible to deactivate plugins one at a time until the problem disappears?
[10:09:43] <thykka> or does that break the ajax JS
[10:10:21] <Sal> ok, i'll try to comment out all my plugins
[10:11:04] <Sal> but as i said, i serached in all my plugins, and there is not .css() call inserting overflow-y
[10:12:03] <thykka> is the ajax call a jsonp?
[10:12:13] <thykka> or does it otherwise fetch code that gets run
[10:12:15] <Sal> nop, html
[10:12:20] <shoky_> they don't necessarily have to have "overflow-y" string in the code
[10:12:25] <shoky_> and it could be in the css file too..
[10:13:00] <Sal> the ajax call gets a php file that returns a piece of html with replaced variables
[10:13:15] <Sal> so, there's no js returnd and css is alreay set in html
[10:13:51] <shoky_> also you can set it with  element.style.overflowY
[10:14:20] <thykka> good catch
[10:14:29] <Sal>  $('#index-content').html(data);
[10:14:39] <Sal> it gets added after that
[10:14:57] <Sal> but it gets added at #index-main
[10:15:02] <Sal> div
[10:15:03] <Sal> strange
[10:15:45] <Sal> oh, let me search for overflow then
[10:16:23] <shoky_> even jquery has overflow..
[10:17:11] <Sal> found it guys!
[10:17:13] <Sal> https://goo.gl/TsmPoK
[10:17:34] <Sal> its a damn obj i'm using for block scrolling on iphone
[10:17:39] <Sal> grrr apple
[10:18:13] <Sal> sorry for taking your time on this stupid thing
[10:18:15] <Sal> thanks
[13:58:08] <blindmoe> ok I appologize right off the bat because I am sure this question ahs been asked a million times but I can't seem to find a solid answer on Google.  I have a parent -> child dependant drop down setup where one drop down determines the available options in the second
[13:58:44] <blindmoe> when the user changes the first dropdown it hides / shows options in the second accordingly.  The issue I am having is that even if I set the .val() of the second dropdown, the text shown in the select box is always the old value
[13:59:01] <blindmoe> even though that option is hidden and not technically selected and the .val() of the select comes back as a different value
[13:59:45] <blindmoe> I am sure there is somethign stupid I am missing
[14:00:09] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us a test case?
[14:02:28] <blindmoe> Sure I can mock one up really quick
[14:11:18] <blindmoe> robertmaxrees: haha well of course when I but it out in CodePen it works as expected
[14:11:31] <blindmoe> time to break it down on my end
[14:13:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:13:06] <robertmaxrees> maybe something else is going on.
[14:13:13] <robertmaxrees> another script is causing headaches or w/e
[14:23:08] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:remember a yesterday discussion about how to target empty input fields when there are filled ones in the DOM
[14:23:18] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/z9rkbqk8/13/
[14:23:36] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[14:25:15] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 that fiddle seems odd.  you want empty inputs but you're doing return val('');
[14:25:47] <robertmaxrees> which is going to return a jquery object, which is truthy.
[14:26:06] <robertmaxrees> oh wait - you're not even calling it on a jquery element.
[14:28:06] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:you made the same comment yesterday about val('')...at which point I said I used val() to check for the input field being empty or  not....apart from that I was not sure what I was doing
[14:28:06] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 so you have two things to chnage - 1) call val as a method int hat filter, and 2) don't set the value, just read it.
[14:31:10] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:provide some help please...
[14:31:59] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting me to do?
[14:32:04] <robertmaxrees> i explained what you need :)
[14:32:08] <dimi1947> edit the fiddle...in theory I can understand what you say but....
[14:32:14] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:32:14] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:32:15] <taplar> do it for him
[14:32:18] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[14:32:19] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:32:21] <taplar> doooooo eeeeeet
[14:32:23] <taplar> ;)
[14:32:28] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 call val() as a method on $(this)
[14:32:34] <robertmaxrees> aka $(this).val()
[14:33:24] <taplar> or this.value
[14:33:27] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[14:33:33] <robertmaxrees> either/or
[14:33:34] <dimi1947> did it....what is next
[14:33:42] <robertmaxrees> link to your update.
[14:34:14] <robertmaxrees> pls
[14:34:21] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/z9rkbqk8/15/
[14:34:29] <robertmaxrees> gotta return that.
[14:34:41] <robertmaxrees> aqnd i didn't say to do .val('')
[14:34:44] <robertmaxrees> i said .val()
[14:34:54] <robertmaxrees> if you pass anything to val, it uses that to set the value.
[14:35:02] <robertmaxrees> you want to get the value, so you don't want the '' in there.
[14:36:19] <dimi1947> hmmm...
[14:36:24] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:37:24] <dimi1947> your remark about val()...to the point
[14:37:31] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[14:37:38] <dimi1947> nevermind
[14:37:58] <dimi1947> so...I must return it know
[14:38:31] <taplar> you have to return truthy/falsy
[14:38:41] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/#filter-function
[14:38:57] <dimi1947> give me 3 minutes
[14:39:20] <robertmaxrees> there also an example of how to use the function on that page :
[14:39:56] <taplar> and as a side note, if you look up in your html area, anything that is highlighted in red is jsfiddle telling you have broken html syntax
[14:46:34] <dimi1947> what page?
[14:47:25] <dimi1947> I suppose you mean in the jquery manual in the page about filter
[14:48:37] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:48:45] <robertmaxrees> the jquery docs have a wealth of information.
[14:49:46] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/z9rkbqk8/18/
[14:51:12] <taplar> what, logically, is your filter trying to find?
[14:52:44] <dimi1947> taplar:an empty input
[14:52:54] <taplar> how do you know if an input is empty?
[14:54:02] <dimi1947> no string is found on it
[14:54:14] <taplar> how do you know 'no string' is true?
[14:54:54] <dimi1947> do you mean I should use trim...is this headed there
[14:55:13] <taplar> no, i'm trying to get you to think of the equation you need to do for your logic
[14:55:23] <taplar> you want to test if a string is empty
[14:55:34] <robertmaxrees> not if it's the number one.
[14:55:44] <dimi1947> yes....I understand what is the purpose of all these
[14:55:51] <taplar> so, how do you test for that?
[14:56:06] <robertmaxrees> return $(this).val() === 1; means "is the value of this string 1?"
[14:56:14] <robertmaxrees> you just want to know if it's empty, which is a falsy value.
[14:57:02] <taplar> but 'empty' isn't a value
[14:57:13] <taplar> so you have to put it in terms the computer understands
[14:57:17] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/z9rkbqk8/19/
[14:57:28] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[14:57:56] <robertmaxrees> you can also just do return !$(this).val();
[14:58:18] <dimi1947> AT LAST A SOLUTION WAS FOUND....
[14:58:34] <robertmaxrees> understand it now?
[14:58:34] <taplar> do you understand the solution though?
[14:58:37] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:58:39] <robertmaxrees> taplar+++
[14:58:42] <taplar> :)
[14:59:02] <dimi1947> YES...this discussion was not in vein
[14:59:14] <taplar> #nodrugs
[15:00:16] <Neo3> how to compare two jQuery objects?
[15:00:22] <robertmaxrees> Neo3 compare how?>
[15:00:27] <dimi1947> the only problem is that chars created from space are counted...so I must use trim also in that function
[15:00:32] <Neo3> equal they or not
[15:00:40] <robertmaxrees> Neo3 use .is()
[15:00:41] <taplar> dimi1947: that's a good safeguard
[15:00:47] <robertmaxrees> $foo.is($bar)
[15:01:03] <dimi1947> taplar:you mean trim?
[15:01:06] <taplar> yep
[15:01:11] <Neo3> if ($('selector1') == $('selector2') ){ to do something}
[15:01:23] <robertmaxrees> Neo3 just showed you what to use :)
[15:01:26] <dimi1947> thx for the help...both
[15:01:30] <Neo3> well
[15:02:05] <robertmaxrees> Neo3 ??
[15:02:21] <robertmaxrees> if ($('.thing').is($('.otherthing'));
[15:02:47] <taplar> you don't need the $() on the second selector, technically
[15:02:59] <robertmaxrees> oh dang.
[15:03:01] <robertmaxrees> you're right.
[15:03:38] <robertmaxrees> Neo3 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m4bfbdg6/
[15:03:42] <taplar> heh, and if you are using selectors like that, without existing objects, you could select with both and check the length
[15:04:13] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't check if they're equal to one another though.
[15:04:26] <taplar> $('.thing.otherthing').length ?
[15:04:28] <Neo3> robertmaxrees: well, it works
[15:04:30] <Neo3> thanks
[15:04:33] <robertmaxrees> taplar ah.
[15:04:41] <robertmaxrees> taplar fair poing.
[15:04:43] <robertmaxrees> *point
[15:04:47] <robertmaxrees> there's also .hasClass()
[15:04:51] <Neo3> I'm thinking about OOP in jQuery..
[15:04:59] <robertmaxrees> *javascript
[15:05:00] <taplar> javascript
[15:05:02] <taplar> lmao
[15:05:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery's just a library ;)
[15:05:07] <Neo3> only on javascript?
[15:05:12] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't a langauge.
[15:05:30] <Neo3> yes, it's only use for get and put data to DOM
[15:06:19] <Neo3> will the manage class make in javascript and inside you jQuery, I'm going to make real big framework
[15:06:41] <taplar> i don't understand that first part of that statement
[15:07:15] <taplar> but, before you 'make' a framework, see what's available already first
[15:08:10] <Neo3> taplar: manage class is class that will manage something, for example class pop_up_dialog will manage dialog. other class will manage something other, or better say served, I didn't read OOP in English and maybe confused notions, how say about correctly. I'll read
[15:08:53] <taplar> you mean, associating classes with auto initializing plugins?
[15:09:53] <Neo3> taplar: remember we've been speaking about streamline in programming? OOP is considered the best thing for it. it exactly is made for reuse code. I've already download 10 books about php oop and am going to do this for javascript
[15:10:14] <taplar> you can reuse code without oop
[15:10:22] <Neo3> taplar, no, I mean modular programming where class is module and server something itself
[15:10:36] <taplar> modularity doesn't mean oop
[15:10:44] <Neo3> taplar, no, it's not useful, maybe can
[15:10:46] <Neo3> really?
[15:11:03] <taplar> modularity is a part of oop, but it's not the whole concept
[15:11:08] <Neo3> but all advertises OOP OOP
[15:11:14] <taplar> but you can have modularity in functional programming too
[15:12:02] <taplar> random google, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2078978/functional-programming-vs-object-oriented-programming#2079678
[15:12:29] <Neo3> taplar, no there class is module, probably you can to divide part of program using structure programming
[15:12:40] <Neo3> using namespaces?
[15:13:45] <taplar> namespaces are objects
[15:14:03] <taplar> it's just a way to encapsulate operations
[15:14:33] <Neo3> taplar: see you make class wp plugin, and this class serve only wp plugin, inside this class you create a few classes, CSV, Included_files, Actions, Shortcodes. and each of this classes served their own part of code, you'll easy split program on parts and then you will reuse this parts in others your programs
[15:14:33] <taplar> The distinction for OOP is the OO.  Object Oriented
[15:15:04] <Neo3> it means you will only improve your code instead rebuild the same from zero
[15:15:24] <Neo3> taplar: yes, I badly know this theme, will learn
[15:15:57] <taplar> The "Object" in OO doesn't necessarily mean 'object'
[15:16:04] <taplar> in that if you have an object, you are doing OO
[15:16:18] <taplar> The concept is that the object defines a "thing"
[15:16:37] <taplar> And that "thing" has defined properties and methods and such.
[15:16:58] <robertmaxrees> there's also object functional programming.
[15:17:50] <taplar> what's the concept for that?
[15:18:09] <Neo3> taplar: see now I'm doing checking one checkbox form list, user checks checkbox and only one should be checked, and other not, I did it before and now again I rebuild this code. I'm tired to do it again and again
[15:18:36] <taplar> Neo3: that's fine.  i'm just talking concepts
[15:19:13] <taplar> you call a cat a tiger, i'm going to disagree with you.  you call a tiger a cat, i can't say much
[15:19:43] <Neo3> taplar: see would be good create class where I put selector "carat input[type=checkbox]" and automatically will apply checked only one checkbox in list
[15:20:09] <Neo3> taplar, how to do this?
[15:20:14] <taplar> why does that have to be a class?
[15:20:31] <robertmaxrees> classes just describe a thing and its behaviors.
[15:20:33] <Neo3> Class Check_checkbox
[15:20:40] <robertmaxrees> that's not really a class.
[15:20:45] <taplar> why not just an IIFE with that expression in it?
[15:21:14] <taplar> there's not really a reason to be able to instantiate something if that's all it does
[15:21:14] <Neo3> taplar, it can be function, but I want to in OOP, instantly learn it
[15:21:23] <Neo3> taplar: IIFE ?
[15:21:34] <taplar> Immediately Invoked Functional Expression
[15:21:35] <robertmaxrees> Neo3 then you need to build a class that describes the checkbox element, not a behavior of it.
[15:21:42] <taplar> ^
[15:22:45] <Neo3> taplar: see it's code easy, do you agree with me, I did it a few times before, but I forgot how I did and again spend time recreate from zero..... :( http://prntscr.com/ho1qia
[15:23:12] <Neo3> robertmaxrees: in javascript?
[15:23:23] <robertmaxrees> Neo3 if that's what you care about, yeah.
[15:23:39] <robertmaxrees> the problem with classical OOP is that classes are sometimes not the solution you want.
[15:23:47] <taplar> That logic could easily be put in a namespace in a method that could be executed and reused
[15:24:24] <taplar> But that logic isn't really something you want to repeat, as the selector is to broad.
[15:24:38] <Neo3> yes, I understand it's slow me, If I have my libs in OOP. I did it call one function or something similar and didn't ask how to compare. I want to say you, We are spending much time seems in vain...
[15:25:24] <Neo3> Now in modern worlds people don't think they all do copy and past, Find information, then copy past it, without learning.
[15:25:42] <Neo3> taplar: agree
[15:25:43] <robertmaxrees> also: you're basically recreating a radio button there.
[15:26:15] <Neo3> that checkbox, yes, type doesn't matter
[15:26:28] <Neo3> sense it doesn't change
[15:26:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:26:43] <taplar> [type=checkbox]  says type does matter
[15:26:44] <robertmaxrees> type does matter though.
[15:26:56] <robertmaxrees> users expect checkboxes to let you check multiples.
[15:27:11] <robertmaxrees> when you don't allow that, you're basically mucking with their expectations.
[15:27:13] <Neo3> you can change it [type=radiobutton] Or I forgot how correctly
[15:27:19] <Neo3> radio*
[15:27:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:27:21] <taplar> but that doesn't make sense
[15:27:26] <robertmaxrees> you don't need that code at all at that point.
[15:27:30] <robertmaxrees> because radios do this by default.
[15:27:36] <taplar> as robert is saying, radio buttons inherently don't let you select more than one
[15:28:02] <Neo3> robertmaxrees: but I need only one among bunch
[15:28:10] <taplar> which is what a radio does
[15:28:14] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[15:28:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/45rq8dd6/
[15:28:32] <Neo3> multiple is not problem
[15:28:54] <Neo3> taplar: oh yes, I forgot
[15:29:06] <robertmaxrees> my point is that you've recreated something that already exists ;)
[15:29:13] <robertmaxrees> no js needed.  which is always a good thing.
[15:29:24] <Neo3> oh and you mean use radiobutton instead, Understood
[15:29:34] <Neo3> )))
[15:30:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:30:57] <Neo3> but anyway I think not bad to try create your own class. Class for Ajax. or existing classes aren't bad. I'm confused. Really very slow do code :(
[15:31:12] <taplar> Why a class?
[15:32:02] <taplar> Classes are meant to be able to be instantiated, and represent a distinct instance of a given "thing"
[15:32:08] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:32:12] <robertmaxrees> you're describing behaviors.
[15:32:15] <taplar> If it doesn't make sense to have multiple "things"...
[15:33:34] <Neo3> taplar: see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes
[15:33:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:33:44] <taplar> what about what i said didn't make sense?
[15:34:44] <Neo3> taplar: yes, we can instantiate it put selectors and represent in other behavior just call differ methods
[15:35:01] <taplar> And why do you need something like that for "ajax" ?
[15:35:09] <taplar> ajax isn't a thing
[15:35:18] <taplar> a "thing"
[15:35:26] <Neo3> everybody use classes, why shall we deviate from it?
[15:35:33] <taplar> no they don't
[15:35:44] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[15:35:54] <robertmaxrees> classical OO is one way to solve for some problems.
[15:35:58] <Neo3> taplar: always use it in each project that $.ajax
[15:36:10] <taplar> not if it doesn't serve a purpose
[15:36:21] <robertmaxrees> and $.ajax describes an action to take.
[15:36:27] <Neo3> if you know it good, unless it's also problem ))
[15:36:35] <taplar> *sigh*
[15:36:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:36:44] <Neo3> )))
[15:37:05] <taplar> there are many ways to solve problems
[15:37:11] <taplar> classes are one way
[15:37:12] <taplar> BUT
[15:37:18] <taplar> there are reasons to use classes
[15:37:33] <taplar> if those reasons don't exist, you don't limit yourself to solutions
[15:38:02] <taplar> putting blinders on yourself doesn't help you be a better programmer
[15:38:20] <Neo3> taplar: you won't create one function, for future for you better learn OOP because javascript is used in many domains, such as node.js or some javascript libs, You'll apply this knowledge there
[15:38:32] <taplar> dude
[15:38:41] <Neo3> and in any languages, OOP principles are common for all languages
[15:38:45] <taplar> i know OOP
[15:38:46] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[15:38:50] <taplar> I know why to use OOP
[15:38:55] <robertmaxrees> i like how Neo3 doesn't really understand classical OO and then tries to coach everybody else on their careers.
[15:38:55] <taplar> and as a result I know why not to
[15:39:06] <taplar> :)
[15:39:15] <robertmaxrees> so Neo3 frp/react/et al are useless?
[15:39:17] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[15:40:20] <Neo3> robertmaxrees: didn't understand last
[15:40:55] <Neo3> well, I'll try to create first class, put it on fiddel, and show you for examine )))
