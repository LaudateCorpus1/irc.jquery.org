[00:00:03] <Kartagis> Uhkis: yep
[00:00:05] <dmsuperman> sacho_: sssshhhhh
[00:00:12] <dmsuperman> you don't want to open any more worm cans than need be
[00:00:16] <Kartagis> sacho_: I use moment.js as well
[00:00:18] <ceterizine|work> holy effin shit
[00:00:20] <Kartagis> used*
[00:00:22] <ceterizine|work> it saves O_O
[00:00:25] <dmsuperman> ceterizine|work: :)
[00:00:32] <sacho_> ok
[00:00:33] <ceterizine|work> only downside now is
[00:00:48] <ceterizine|work> when you actually drag and drop, the sorting doesnt change in that instance
[00:00:54] <ceterizine|work> but if you refresh, the sorting will be updated
[00:01:06] <ceterizine|work> The sorting will snap back, but the
[00:01:07] <dmsuperman> the sorting doesn't change = it doesn't save in the database?
[00:01:08] <dmsuperman> or what
[00:01:13] <ceterizine|work> no the sort saves
[00:01:27] <ceterizine|work> lets say I drag item 4 to item 1 spot
[00:01:39] <ceterizine|work> it will snap back to spot 4
[00:01:45] <dmsuperman> let's see the frontend code
[00:01:53] <dmsuperman> does it still save your intended order?
[00:02:14] <ceterizine|work> http://pastebin.com/VaDd4B8J
[00:02:17] <ceterizine|work> yep
[00:02:49] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: you got a syntax error. I straight up gave you the line to copy/paste in place there up above btw
[00:03:04] <dmsuperman> frontend JS ceterizine|work ;)
[00:03:30] <ceterizine|work> what do I have to do?
[00:04:06] <dmsuperman> paste the frontend javascript
[00:04:12] <Kartagis> oh. my. god
[00:04:22] <ceterizine|work> oh
[00:04:24] <ceterizine|work> lol
[00:04:27] <ceterizine|work> Im an idiot han gon
[00:04:34] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: you're the best man :)
[00:04:46] <Kartagis> dmsuperman++
[00:04:53] <ceterizine|work> forgot to write the .success part of
[00:05:16] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: can I buy you a beer? (this is not a date though :P)
[00:05:35] <dmsuperman> only if you blo-- oh nevermind then
[00:05:37] <dmsuperman> hahaha
[00:05:39] <dmsuperman> no worries
[00:05:42] <dmsuperman> glad we got that all sorted
[00:05:43] <Uhkis> next time use fapi #states and be done with it in a minute :-D
[00:05:45] <dmsuperman> my head hurts now.
[00:06:13] <dmsuperman> Uhkis: there's about a million things we could have done differently I suspect
[00:06:15] <Kartagis> Uhkis: me?
[00:06:35] <dmsuperman> oh you have a drupal specific suggestion, I see
[00:07:45] <Uhkis> Kartagis: yes
[00:08:26] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I was playing around with my new shiny toy, driving doug64k mad in the process
[00:08:51] <doug64k> lol
[00:09:04] <Kartagis> there you
[00:09:09] <Kartagis> smile, big fella
[00:09:22] <Kartagis> there you go*
[00:09:53] <Uhkis> very evil of you
[00:09:55] <ceterizine|work> here is my frontend JS that seems to just cause an absolute panic attack of network requests when I drag and drop http://pastebin.com/bTUt3Qaw
[00:10:09] <doug64k> can anyone see why this leaks elements http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/20/
[00:10:26] <doug64k> I checked and rechecked that it really removes elements, yet $('*').length keeps growing
[00:10:37] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I never meant to
[00:10:37] <dmsuperman> needs more caulk
[00:10:41] <dmsuperman> yuck yuck yuck
[00:10:45] <doug64k> lol
[00:11:02] <dmsuperman> leaks elements meaning what
[00:11:17] <doug64k> meaning $('*').length keeps reporting larger values when you scroll
[00:11:24] <doug64k> it is supposed to destroy the ones offscreen
[00:11:39] <Kartagis> yuck yuck yuck reminds me of Barney of The Flintstones :D
[00:12:24] <dmsuperman> doug64k: where are you counting the length?
[00:12:31] <dmsuperman> or can you update the fiddle to include the count
[00:12:33] <dmsuperman> in some way
[00:12:37] <doug64k> dmsuperman: manually, in the console
[00:12:40] <doug64k> sure
[00:12:41] <doug64k> good idea
[00:13:11] <dmsuperman> (preferably by updating a floating node instead of printing 108525k counts to the console :P0
[00:14:07] <dmsuperman> also have you considered that this will break control + f?
[00:14:46] <doug64k> http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/21/
[00:15:12] <doug64k> dmsuperman: ya normally I do put something. I just added that spam to see :D
[00:15:43] <dmsuperman> try adding a context to the selector like $('*', parts) ?
[00:15:58] <dmsuperman> maybe there's some kind of garbage collection that * doesn't account for
[00:16:04] <dmsuperman> * is a weird selector anyway
[00:16:09] <dmsuperman> another possibility, try counting only divs
[00:16:22] <doug64k> useful debug output http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/22/
[00:17:16] <doug64k> dmsuperman: now counts divs http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/24/
[00:17:42] <doug64k> it .removes them! try uncommenting the other version that puts it fixed at the top
[00:20:40] <dmsuperman> my guess is that v.v is undefined or not what you think
[00:20:46] <dmsuperman> if you inspect the DOM the rows are still there
[00:20:53] <dmsuperman> and .remove won't complain if it's run on an empty set
[00:21:12] <doug64k> dmsuperman: that isn't it
[00:21:22] <doug64k> if you uncomment the other one it can .css them and put them at the top
[00:21:43] <doug64k> v.v.css('top', '0px').css('position', 'fixed');   <-- works, puts them at the top
[00:21:53] <dmsuperman> perhaps, but when I look at the console where you have
[00:22:02] <dmsuperman> "removing row 201 row is [jquery:...]"
[00:22:07] <dmsuperman> the object is empty when I inspect it
[00:22:22] <dmsuperman> and again... when I inspect the dom the rows are definitely still there
[00:22:33] <doug64k> oh!
[00:23:07] <doug64k> :O how is that possible
[00:23:14] <doug64k> that is exactly what it appended
[00:24:20] <Kartagis> hrm
[00:25:02] <doug64k> and how could the .css work
[00:25:09] <Kartagis> closingTime.val() - openingTime.val() used to work for me, now it's giving NaN :S
[00:25:33] <dmsuperman> I don't think it used to work for you ;)
[00:25:38] <doug64k> look at this version, it puts them at the top using v.v http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/25/
[00:25:58] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: closingTime.val() is a string, right. so open your javascript console and try to see if you can subtract two time strings like that
[00:26:01] <dmsuperman> I bet you get NaN
[00:26:11] <dmsuperman> "10:15" - "10:00" will give you NaN
[00:26:19] <doug64k> js> print("hello" - "goodbye")
[00:26:25] <b-ot> doug64k: NaN
[00:26:44] <dmsuperman> (this is a good way to test code without having to modify your page and refresh btw. figure out how to properly subject those two strings and then just sub your variables back in place)
[00:26:45] <Kartagis> I forgot what I had put the other day :S
[00:26:55] <dmsuperman> subtract*
[00:27:17] <doug64k> js> print({} - 1)
[00:27:23] <b-ot> doug64k: NaN
[00:27:27] <dmsuperman> that would have helped with your earlier issue too. you need to stop and debug your statements more thoroughly
[00:27:56] <doug64k> dmsuperman: can you explain how an empty jquery does that in http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/25/
[00:28:07] <dmsuperman> it helped when I was a fresh programmer to never make one-liners (ie keep it one line = one operation)
[00:29:12] <dmsuperman> it's not empty now! haha. so maybe the console isn't retroactive
[00:29:22] <doug64k> is you mean
[00:29:30] <dmsuperman> ah yeah I guess so
[00:29:34] <doug64k> but it magically changes the jQuery object?
[00:29:43] <dmsuperman> that I'm not sure, honestly
[00:29:48] <doug64k> hold on, let me make it do both
[00:29:52] <dmsuperman> the console has always been slightly magical
[00:30:14] <dmsuperman> I was trying to test that earlier actually but I forgot its hard to run console commands against the fiddle output window
[00:30:30] <dmsuperman> and so I gave up.
[00:30:31] <dmsuperman> lol
[00:32:40] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: parseInt(closingTime.val())-parseInt(openingTime.val())
[00:33:03] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: read what I wrote above please
[00:33:06] <doug64k> dmsuperman: in chrome, pull down the <top frame> thing. in ff, execute: cd(window.frames[0])
[00:33:08] <Cork> don't forget the base when you use parseInt!
[00:33:22] <dmsuperman> at 03:26, 03:27, 03:28 (EDT)
[00:33:22] <Cork> or you can get really strange results
[00:33:34] <Cork> like "9" == 10
[00:33:41] <dmsuperman> irrelevant, parseInt isn't hte issue here. almost definitely he doesn't even want parseInt
[00:33:56] <Cork> it isn't irrelevant, as you have bugs in the code
[00:34:08] <doug64k> moment is loaded, he can parse it properly
[00:34:15] <dmsuperman> better still
[00:34:27] <dmsuperman> either way, good learning experience
[00:34:35] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: you need to stop and debug your statements more thoroughly <--- this one?
[00:35:01] <caraconan> Hi there. I want to append a <div> to a <li>. Is this code correct? http://paste.debian.net/127858/ The <li> is there, but the link is not working, because I guess the <div> where not attached to <li>. Developing on cordova + JQM. Thanks
[00:35:15] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: yeah, there were more. basically, you need to first figure out how to find the difference of two time strings
[00:35:38] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: take "10:15" and "10:00" and figure out how to get 15 minutes out of those two strings
[00:35:43] <dmsuperman> then start to build your expression back up
[00:35:55] <dmsuperman> don't start putting all your variables in place until you actually understand the solution
[00:36:14] <dmsuperman> doug64k was right, you have moment.js so it should be trivial
[00:36:54] <dmsuperman> fire up your javascript console in your browser and try stuff with those two strings until you can get 15 minutes as the result
[00:37:00] <dmsuperman> then you'll understand how to correct that line
[00:37:18] <dmsuperman> chop wood, carry water
[00:37:55] <doug64k> Cork: any ideas why http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/25/ "leaks" elements? $('*').length keeps growing even though I .remove them
[00:38:21] <dmsuperman> Cork: it is irrelevant, as the code isn't even solving the problem yet
[00:38:35] <dmsuperman> Cork: it makes no sense to fix bugs in code that you will just delete once you find the solution to the problem
[00:38:42] <dmsuperman> it's the classic XY problem
[00:38:47] <Cork> dmsuperman: but building an example that has known errors in it is kinda crazy
[00:38:53] <Cork> if you want to find where the problem is
[00:39:00] <Cork> fix the easy bugs so you know what your testing
[00:39:14] <dmsuperman> again, you're trying to solve Y when Y isn't even the right solution to X
[00:39:19] <dmsuperman> parseInt is in no way applicable to his problem
[00:39:39] <Cork> i haven't even looked at that problem
[00:39:43] <dmsuperman> I'm aware
[00:39:47] <Cork> but parseInt must always have a base
[00:39:52] <doug64k> Cork: short version: he's parsing dates
[00:39:52] <Cork> or you might parse octets
[00:39:58] <dmsuperman> I'm also aware
[00:40:02] <dmsuperman> but you're still solving Y
[00:40:03] <dmsuperman> not X
[00:40:05] <doug64k> Cork: and has moment loaded
[00:40:09] <dmsuperman> !xy @cork
[00:40:15] <dmsuperman> boo, wrong channel
[00:40:19] <doug64k> lol cork knows
[00:40:27] <Cork> dmsuperman: i'm not trying to solve anything
[00:40:33] <doug64k> he lives in this channel
[00:40:35] <Cork> i saw an error in the channel and commented on it
[00:40:37] <Cork> thats it
[00:40:42] <dmsuperman> that's not helpful
[00:40:53] <Cork> it is, it informs ppl
[00:40:55] <dmsuperman> if he would have taken that advice it would have derailed him from the actual solution
[00:41:04] * CssNoob Any help please My dropdown menus wont work from product nav http://raineerdelarita.comuv.com/nerpets/index.html# 
[00:41:23] <dmsuperman> and wouldn't have helped him in any way once he figured out that parseInt wasn't part of the solution to X
[00:41:36] <dmsuperman> I agree with you, parseInt needs a base
[00:41:44] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: parseFloat?
[00:41:47] <Cork> doug64k: that code isn't easy to read...
[00:42:07] <doug64k> Cork: it makes a div per row - and is supposed to remove the ones offscreen
[00:42:20] <doug64k> they dont remove
[00:42:41] <doug64k> activeRows has a property per row
[00:42:43] <dmsuperman> the important bit is line 54 where he removes the nodes and line 84 where he counts them
[00:42:46] <Cork> doug64k: where do you remove them?
[00:42:55] <Cork> the only remove code i can find is commented out
[00:43:00] <doug64k> line 54
[00:43:10] <dmsuperman> we're trying different stuff, go back a version
[00:43:11] <Macaveli> can you give focus to an H1?
[00:43:20] <dmsuperman> Macaveli: what do you mean by focus
[00:43:20] <Cork> doug64k: //v.v.remove(); <--
[00:43:24] <Cork> commented out
[00:43:34] <Macaveli> dmsuperman it needsto be highlight like you tab it
[00:43:44] <doug64k> Cork: oops, http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/26
[00:44:20] <dmsuperman> Macaveli: maybe through tabindex? not sure if that's even valid HTML or just IE magic though
[00:44:29] <doug64k> Cork: that wasnt it
[00:44:32] <doug64k> it still does it
[00:44:33] <Macaveli> i'm using tabindex
[00:44:38] <Macaveli> dmsuperman ^
[00:44:45] <Macaveli> stil highlights chrome browser first
[00:44:51] <doug64k> Cork: sorry I was messing about there and didnt give updated url
[00:45:05] <dmsuperman> Macaveli: you could wrap the h1 in an <a> tag maybe?
[00:45:07] <Cork> doug64k: you should try segmenting the code more
[00:45:14] <Cork> it is really hard to follow it...
[00:46:36] <dmsuperman> doug64k: I added a console.log v.v.length
[00:46:43] <dmsuperman> after you scroll for a bit the length is 0
[00:47:13] <Cork> so activeRows is leaking
[00:47:19] <dmsuperman> I bet it's a scope issue
[00:47:23] <dmsuperman> maybe you need iife?
[00:47:26] <Cork> or rather some new variables isn't added
[00:47:41] <caraconan> I'm not able to generate, dynamically, a list of <li> with popups. Any fiddle out there? Thanks
[00:47:44] <Cork> one thing that worries me is the delete in forEach
[00:47:56] <Cork> as your modifying the activeRows from inside a loop of its values
[00:47:56] <dmsuperman> hrm, .forEach creates a fresh scope though...
[00:48:02] <Cork> i think you might break things
[00:48:09] <dmsuperman> but still, v.v.length is 0. so the selector is definitely empty when it goes to remove the elements
[00:48:11] <Cork> ya, but he removes the current element from the array
[00:48:33] <dmsuperman> yeah but that doesn't really impact anything. I tried commenting out the delete line to be sure
[00:48:35] <doug64k> Cork: I looked into that, the documentation is pretty explicit that it is legal
[00:48:41] <dmsuperman> I think that's just overzealous GC prodding
[00:48:44] <doug64k> Cork: but I'll reimplement it just in case you are right
[00:48:49] <Cork> dmsuperman: you mean it caches the original array?
[00:48:56] <doug64k> ah, but
[00:49:16] <Cork> haven't done that in a long while, but i think it doesn't
[00:49:36] <dmsuperman> really all that matters here is v.v, which should be a jquery object referencing the rows he wants to remove, right?
[00:49:40] <dmsuperman> and v.v.length is 0
[00:49:47] <dmsuperman> so v.v is not what it is expected to be
[00:49:52] <Cork> no
[00:50:00] <Cork> v.v reflects the matched element of one row
[00:50:08] <dmsuperman> well, right
[00:50:16] <dmsuperman> referencing the row**
[00:50:16] <Kartagis> okay, I give up
[00:50:22] <Kartagis> what do I use?
[00:50:30] <dmsuperman> your scroll up button.
[00:50:36] <dmsuperman> where we gave you the answer
[00:50:38] <dmsuperman> like 3 times
[00:50:38] <dmsuperman> :P
[00:51:15] <doug64k> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/01h9mhLh/27/
[00:51:18] <Kartagis> debug?
[00:51:19] <doug64k> it deletes
[00:51:37] <dmsuperman> doug64k: http://jsfiddle.net/47mxrcmn/1/
[00:51:43] <Cork> doug64k: sure, that wasn't the question
[00:51:58] <Cork> doug64k: but [1,2,3] loop remove might leave [2]
[00:52:16] <Cork> cause first it goes to 1 removes it goes to the next index that is now 3
[00:52:21] <Cork> so 2 is left behind
[00:52:31] <dmsuperman> or better yet http://jsfiddle.net/47mxrcmn/2/ so we can rule out the "delete" stuff entirely
[00:52:38] <doug64k> Cork: really?
[00:52:41] <dmsuperman> I removed it. problem still there
[00:53:00] <Cork> doug64k: you modify the array as you loop it
[00:53:37] <doug64k> Cork: ok, I understand. let me try doing it after
[00:54:36] <Cork> anyway need to get back to work
[00:54:43] <dmsuperman> the delete stuff is irrelevant guys
[00:54:49] <dmsuperman> it's an array that has nothing to do with the DOM
[00:55:40] <dmsuperman> js> var a = ['a', 'b', 'c']; a.forEach(function(v,i) { console.log('item ' + i); delete a[i]; });
[00:55:45] <b-ot> dmsuperman: No output.
[00:55:48] <dmsuperman> it still fires a forEach callback each time
[00:55:53] <dmsuperman> this bot sucks :)
[00:56:05] <dmsuperman> in my console I get item 0 1 and 2
[00:56:51] <dmsuperman> however if you delete an item ahead before you get there, it indeed does not call the callback
[00:56:57] <dmsuperman> var a = ['a', 'b', 'c']; a.forEach(function(v,i) { console.log('item ' + i); if (a[i + 1]) delete a[i + 1]; });
[00:57:00] <dmsuperman> only fires twice
[00:57:02] <doug64k> Cork: done http://jsfiddle.net/47mxrcmn/3/
[00:57:09] <doug64k> same
[00:57:51] <AldNOY> why after appending content from ajax result I can't find it by $("#some_id") ? It only finds what was there already before the ajax request
[00:57:55] <doug64k> Cork: if I append a jquery (synthesized div from html string like $('<div/>')) to the dom, later, that jquery still refers to it right?
[00:58:17] <dmsuperman> AldNOY: are you sure you're running a fresh selector after the DOM change?
[00:58:26] <dmsuperman> a selector won't update with new nodes magically, you have to run it again
[00:58:28] <Cork> AldNOY: by after you mean $.ajax(); $('#some_id') ?
[00:58:45] <AldNOY> I did it inside .done() function
[00:58:56] <Cork> AldNOY: you have the same id twice?
[00:58:57] <dmsuperman> jsfiddle your code please AldNOY
[00:59:08] <AldNOY> actually yes, same id twice
[00:59:10] <Cork> try $('[id="some_id]').length
[00:59:11] <dmsuperman> ah there you go
[00:59:14] <Cork> if it is bigger then 1
[00:59:16] <dmsuperman> that's invalid
[00:59:16] <Cork> you have a bug
[00:59:28] <Cork> *try $('[id="some_id"]').length
[00:59:39] <Cork> ids is unique
[00:59:45] <AldNOY> yep, that's the problem
[00:59:46] <Cork> and my only exist on one element at a time
[00:59:50] <AldNOY> I have several with the same id
[00:59:56] <Cork> use a class instead then
[00:59:57] <AldNOY> I'll change it to class
[01:00:06] <AldNOY> thanks

[01:04:24] <doug64k> or where
[01:04:40] <Cork> doug64k: in for (var r = displayedRangeBegin; r < displayedRangeEnd; ++r) {
[01:04:46] <Cork> line 66
[01:05:34] <doug64k> exactly, if <we need to generate one for this row because the key isnt in activeRows>
[01:05:45] <Cork> sure
[01:05:51] <Cork> and if it is you replace it with $('')
[01:06:14] <doug64k> but it deletes it, (js delete property)
[01:06:15] <Cork> parts = []; ifa ctiveRows[r] == true
[01:06:32] <Cork> row = $(''); activeRow[r] = row
[01:06:42] <doug64k> activeRows stores the jquery it made on line 85
[01:06:48] <Cork> yes
[01:06:56] <Cork> but if activeRow exist you don't set any parts
[01:06:59] <doug64k> I'm totally not getting the point am I
[01:07:00] <Cork> so it is an empty array
[01:07:11] <Cork> and row will be empty
[01:07:25] <Cork> and you will overwrite the old
[01:08:29] <doug64k> oh!
[01:08:30] <dmsuperman> I also realized doug64k that you're basing the row number on the scroll offset
[01:08:39] <dmsuperman> once you fix this bug the scroll offset will always be small, no?
[01:08:56] <dmsuperman> or are you making some super expanding div?
[01:08:56] <Cork> ouch good point
[01:09:08] <dmsuperman> which seems nasty
[01:09:24] <dmsuperman> anyway it's 4am here lol
[01:09:26] <dmsuperman> I need sleep
[01:09:26] <doug64k> fixed http://jsfiddle.net/47mxrcmn/4/
[01:09:44] <doug64k> dmsuperman: there's one massive div
[01:09:49] <doug64k> that makes space
[01:09:54] <doug64k> the rest are absolutely positioned
[01:09:57] <dmsuperman> ew :)
[01:10:04] <dmsuperman> good luck haha
[01:10:15] <doug64k> dmsuperman: dude it is showing over a million cell table instantly
[01:10:34] <dmsuperman> well it's showing a <200 cell table... ;)
[01:10:37] <dmsuperman> but yeah
[01:10:43] <doug64k> dmsuperman: exactly
[01:10:54] <dmsuperman> if it works it works. just makes me shiver, that way of doing it
[01:10:59] <dmsuperman> based on height alone
[01:11:01] <doug64k> how do you make a 1 million cell table fast? by not making a 1 million cell table
[01:11:15] <dmsuperman> it's still not even that fast
[01:11:25] <doug64k> dmsuperman: no?
[01:11:31] <doug64k> the debounce code makes it feel slower
[01:11:35] <Cork> doug64k: btw, why aren't you using a normal table?
[01:11:43] <doug64k> Cork: you're joking right?
[01:11:56] <doug64k> every time you add a cell it reflows the whole thing
[01:11:56] <dmsuperman> looots of delay when I scroll
[01:11:58] <Cork> i didn't mean to keep all the rows in the rendred page
[01:12:05] <dmsuperman> more than 100 ms worth of delay
[01:12:19] <doug64k> dmsuperman: really?
[01:12:19] <dmsuperman> on a relatively unloaded i7 machine
[01:12:20] <Cork> doug64k: you create the dom elements and set them in the table as you scroll
[01:12:32] <Cork> and then just have the table position fixed
[01:12:36] <doug64k> Cork: as I scroll eh? why is the scrollbar so big tho
[01:12:46] <caraconan> I'm having issues with popups generated dynamically. Can somebody please provide an example? I'm generating <li> and I want to create a <div> with a popup for each one of them. Thanks
[01:12:47] <doug64k> without something making a reason to need to scroll
[01:13:14] <doug64k> dmsuperman: how much is lots
[01:13:36] <dmsuperman> well... if I scroll slowly I guess
[01:13:39] <doug64k> how could this implementation possibly not be fast
[01:13:40] <dmsuperman> maybe your debounce is just buggy
[01:13:55] <dmsuperman> if I try to scroll really fast though it takes a few seconds to catch up
[01:14:00] <doug64k> it makes 10 divs
[01:14:10] <doug64k> it doesnt even move anything when you scroll
[01:14:16] <dmsuperman> if I scroll slowly I get about the right amount of delay
[01:14:16] <Cork> doug64k: the reason i asked about using a table for the base is cause now the rows don't lineup
[01:14:29] <doug64k> Cork: yeah, weird eh?
[01:14:29] <Cork> and it looks kidna bad
[01:15:10] <Cork> doug64k: that is how google docs does it for excel views for example
[01:15:19] <doug64k> dmsuperman: catch up? wow
[01:15:40] <dmsuperman> yeah, like if I scroll 300 rows it's almost like it has to draw and destroy all 300
[01:15:49] <dmsuperman> instead of just skipping right to the visible ones
[01:15:49] <doug64k> how is that possible? the code hardly even needs the debounce
[01:16:01] <dmsuperman> I dunno it's your code ;)
[01:16:16] <doug64k> seriously though, no big loops, only touches what needs touching
[01:16:51] <dmsuperman> actually the debounce kind of ruins the experience for me
[01:16:58] <dmsuperman> at least with debounce off I never see a big white blank area
[01:17:03] <dmsuperman> it just stops scrolling until it can catch up
[01:17:27] <dmsuperman> it's no faster or slower tho
[01:17:31] <doug64k> Cork: oh and thanks for noticing that! :D
[01:18:27] <doug64k> dmsuperman: http://jsfiddle.net/47mxrcmn/6/
[01:18:32] <doug64k> should be buttery smooth
[01:18:39] <dmsuperman> not even close
[01:18:46] <dmsuperman> ~8% CPU load on an i7
[01:18:55] <dmsuperman> better experience than the debounced one though
[01:19:02] <dmsuperman> since again, no big white blank space
[01:19:38] <dmsuperman> let me move it to the primary display just to be sure
[01:19:39] <doug64k> dmsuperman: http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/ better?
[01:19:50] <dmsuperman> about the same
[01:20:06] <dmsuperman> nope, not the display
[01:20:19] <caraconan> I'm having issues with popups generated dynamically. Can somebody please provide an example? I'm generating <li> and I want to create a <div> with a popup for each one of them. Thanks
[01:21:10] <dmsuperman> doug64k: oh, it seems to relate to scrolling via the trackpad
[01:21:26] <dmsuperman> if I grab the scrollbar it's smoother
[01:21:34] <dmsuperman> still a *little* lag but much better
[01:21:47] <doug64k> not bad for 0x110000 cells :D
[01:22:11] <doug64k> <- cheater
[01:22:34] <dmsuperman> could you do without the activeRows and just use the scroll offset / height?
[01:22:41] <dmsuperman> that seems overly complicated
[01:22:45] <doug64k> then how do I know which to remove
[01:23:17] <doug64k> my implementation computes the valid range, then removes any with a key outside that range
[01:23:28] <doug64k> s/valid/visible/
[01:23:55] <dmsuperman> I'm not sure entirely. maybe just a different approach beside the stack
[01:23:59] <dmsuperman> it seems related to speed though
[01:24:05] <dmsuperman> code firing too fast to remove all the correct rows
[01:24:49] <dmsuperman> hey wait did you fix it?
[01:24:50] <doug64k> dmsuperman: that has to be way faster than even thinking about a selector lookup
[01:24:58] <dmsuperman> I'm not talking about selector lookup
[01:25:03] <doug64k> I know
[01:25:03] <dmsuperman> I agree there
[01:25:11] <dmsuperman> but really tho
[01:25:14] <dmsuperman> did you fix the leak?
[01:25:15] <dmsuperman> http://jsfiddle.net/7t0kuxbq/1/
[01:25:18] <dmsuperman> fixed 17 rows
[01:25:20] <doug64k> yes cork found it
[01:25:23] <dmsuperman> oh derp
[01:25:31] <doug64k> my if didnt cover those last 3 rows
[01:25:36] <doug64k> I was corrupting activeRows
[01:25:45] <doug64k> last 3 lines of code
[01:26:06] <dmsuperman> nice
[01:26:12] <dmsuperman> well why am I still up then! haha
[01:26:12] <doug64k> my code is usually more readable btw...
[01:26:15] <dmsuperman> bed time
[01:26:20] <doug64k> in this code I am trying to get max speed
[01:26:24] <dmsuperman> function now readability later
[01:26:26] <doug64k> thanks, dmsuperman . good night
[01:26:28] <dmsuperman> you too
[01:26:45] <dmsuperman> now if you can just make it smooth with a trackpad... :P
[01:26:46] <dmsuperman> haha
[01:26:50] <dmsuperman> alright seriously bye
[02:20:47] <gnu_d> Hi, is it possible to use the sort function in order to sort in categories, e.g: I have several divs, each div has a category, what I need here is to sort by category and to maintain the category order to predefined order, is it possible ?
[02:21:23] <Cork> gnu_d: and category is?
[02:21:26] <Cork> data-category?
[02:21:31] <gnu_d> for instance: yes
[02:21:37] <Cork> sure you can
[02:21:37] <gnu_d> sorry
[02:21:44] <gnu_d> I was writing something
[02:21:49] <gnu_d> I meant to says just yes
[02:21:57] <gnu_d> say*
[02:22:12] <Cork> jq.sort(function() {}) will result in a sorted list
[02:22:16] <Cork> without modifying the dom
[02:23:14] <gnu_d>  for instance: food, phone, nature, food, phone, nature; when it's sorted I need to get something like this: food, phone, nature, nature; but I need to have order of categories too, that is: nature, phone, food.
[02:24:19] <Cork> what?
[02:24:22] <gnu_d> Cork: at the moment I've a code with  jq.sort(function() {}) working, but I need to add something to maintain the category priority as well.
[02:24:27] <Cork> sorry that makes no sense
[02:24:40] <gnu_d> Cork: why it doesn't make sense ?
[02:25:02] <Cork> you have multiple categories or something?
[02:25:21] <Cork> also sort by what?
[02:25:32] <Cork> that result list isn't sorted
[02:25:53] <Cork> food, nature, phone would be
[02:26:25] <Cork> gnu_d: you should prob make a jsfiddle of the problem you have
[02:26:41] <gnu_d> Cork: let's have another example, I have 3 types of categories: breakfast, lunch, supper. When the sorter finishes, I will have all the elements sorted by type; but what I also need is to sort them all the sorted items into the proper order above.
[02:26:46] <Cork> ?paste
[02:26:46] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:32:16] <Kartagis> netPay.val(parseFloat(totalCharges.val())*4.94) <--- is this valid?
[02:32:40] <JustMozzy> hey guys. I have a strange problem which I could not reproduce on fiddle. I have a container element on which I attached a click handler. now clicking on any element inside the container will correctly trigger the click handler of the container. my problem is that the child elements may or may not have other event listeners attached which are not being executed, although I am not preventing the default behaviour in my container ele
[02:33:04] <Cork> Kartagis: it should parse if that is what you mean
[02:33:18] <Kartagis> thanks
[02:33:43] <Cork> JustMozzy: break down the line into backstory and question
[02:34:09] <JustMozzy> Cork: Can you elaborate?
[02:34:25] <Cork> JustMozzy: you just posted a 6 line blob of text
[02:34:37] <Cork> if you it won't really make it easy to answer the question
[02:34:42] <Cork> its so long the end is cut of
[02:34:50] <Cork> irc is not email keep it compact
[02:34:57] <JustMozzy> Cork: oh. sorry :)
[02:35:22] <Cork> -"if you "
[02:36:39] <gnu_d> Cork: here is the paste: http://jsfiddle.net/k4kpw46v/1/, sorry that it took me so much time to write it.
[02:36:48] <Cork> gnu_d: no problem
[02:37:25] <Cork> gnu_d: ok and in what way is this not doing what you want?
[02:37:41] <Cork> ugg replacewith??
[02:37:45] <Cork> you want append
[02:37:55] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/k4kpw46v/2/
[02:38:00] <gnu_d> Cork: what it's needed now is to maintain the order of categories, for instance, at the moment Soup is first item, which is of type supper, but we need all supper groups to go at the bottom
[02:39:04] <gnu_d> all dinner groups to be in the middle, and breakfast at the top, but this is only an example, I have many more categories
[02:39:18] <Cork> gnu_d: so http://jsfiddle.net/k4kpw46v/3/?
[02:39:51] <Cork> .not can take a function if you need a more complex filter
[02:42:30] <gnu_d> Cork: what if the data is for instance an object, e.g: data-stuff and the category is stuff.category ?
[02:42:49] <Cork> gnu_d: when you wouldn't be using jquery
[02:43:01] <Cork> gnu_d: make an example matching what you need help with
[02:43:07] <Cork> else it makes it hard to answer
[02:43:07] <gnu_d> sec
[02:44:31] <STR> so i have this $("#billedesrc").text(object.Billede.src); <- displays a img link in txt. What do i use to show a picture instead from that img link
[02:45:03] <gnu_d> Cork: here is the updated version: http://jsfiddle.net/k4kpw46v/4/, but not what's left it to upgrade the .not function
[02:45:21] <Cork> STR: .html('<img src="url">')
[02:45:45] <Cork> STR: or in your case .html($('<img>', { src: .src }))
[02:47:48] <JustMozzy> Having a container with children, on which a click event listener is attached and the children may or may not have events, I am experiencing a broken chain of events for the children. What could be reasons for this?
[02:49:57] <STR> Cork: so the .html loads all my links into the div. RIght? A bit like this? .html($('object.Billede.src, { src: .src }))
[02:50:07] <STR> i know it wrong meh
[02:51:32] <Cork> gnu_d: http://jsfiddle.net/k4kpw46v/5/
[02:52:03] <Cork> JustMozzy: the event handlers on the children might do return false; or event.stopPropagation()
[02:52:30] <Cork> STR: html adds what you give it to the dom
[02:52:36] <Cork> STR: a string will be a string
[02:52:40] <Cork> you need to make an img tag
[02:53:22] <JustMozzy> Cork: Unfortunately they don't. It is actually that their event handlers are not fired. Furthermore native actions such as following an href or submitting a form are not triggered
[02:53:24] <STR> i import those imglinks from json so i cant give it an img tag
[02:53:48] <Cork> JustMozzy: you might have another element covering the element
[02:53:49] <Cork> +s
[02:53:56] <Cork> STR: yes you can
[02:54:01] <Cork> like how i showed you a minute agio
[02:54:07] <Cork> *ago
[02:54:34] <JustMozzy> Cork: that would mean that the target property would be set to that element, however the target property is set to the child
[02:54:34] <Cork> .html('<img src="' + src + '">')
[02:54:40] <Cork> STR: ^
[02:54:44] <Cork> or a cleaner solution
[02:54:56] <Cork> .html($('<img>', { src: src }))
[02:55:10] <Cork> those two basically do the same thing (create an img tag in the dom)
[02:55:48] <Cork> JustMozzy: if normal mouse actions doesn't work it almost always means something else is covering them
[02:55:56] <Cork> or an event handler is blocking it
[02:56:18] <Cork> return false will block default actions like following links
[02:58:42] <gnu_d> Cork: how come: http://jsfiddle.net/k4kpw46v/8/ the breakfast is being ungrouped ?
[03:01:19] <Cork> gnu_d: hmm
[03:01:31] <Cork> i think the original i gave you is borked
[03:01:49] <STR> ty Cork!
[03:01:55] <STR> got it
[03:02:14] <Cork> the test looks really weird looking on it a second time -_-'
[03:02:26] <Cork> aaand by browser hung...
[03:05:25] <Kartagis> I have a problem
[03:05:32] <Cork> gnu_d: your filtering out all elements
[03:05:36] <Cork> so there is nothing to sort
[03:06:35] <Kartagis> I am concetanating values, but if the page gives an additional error because of e-mail address validation, it stops working
[03:09:15] <gnu_d> Cork: but actually need to sort the sorted groups, not filter out, guess .not is not suitable here or ?
[03:10:04] <Cork> gnu_d: you could add an exception in the sort function to always return -1 for the specific ones?
[03:10:12] <Cork> except they are another exception
[03:10:27] <Cork> i really don't get what you're trying to do so it makes it a bit hard
[03:12:08] <ThKo> Good morning guys, I’ve got a problem with page events (jqm) and indexeddb… My indexeddb function which creates the db fires „request.onupgradeneeded = function( event ) { … }“…But when I try to grab records from database I don’t know which page event I’ve to use from jqm…When I try „$( document ).on( ‚pagebeforeshow‘ , "#index" , function( event , data ) { … }“ it says that my function „openCursor()“
[03:12:09] <ThKo> isn’t defined…http://jsfiddle.net/f25rh0c8/ … Any hints for me? :-) Thanks a lot!
[03:12:22] <Cork> ugg
[03:12:25] <gnu_d> Cork: lets say I have categories: 1, 2, 3, 4, when I sort the items, I have: 33, 22, 44, 111 (each number represent which category has how many items), what I need to do after the sort is to move 111 to the top, 22 as a second position, 33 as a third an so on; On the end the result should be: 111, 22, 33, 44
[03:13:28] <Cork> gnu_d: sounds like you want to have exceptions in the sort functions
[03:13:43] <gnu_d> Cork: category priority
[03:14:51] <Cork> gnu_d: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/k4kpw46v/9/

[03:17:25] <Omar-> ThKo functions and variables should be defined before executing them inside page events
[03:17:29] <Cork> gnu_d: you know how sort works right?

[03:24:17] <Woet> Mark___: http://api.jquery.com/slidedown/
[03:24:20] <Omar-> ThKo now you create database once the app starts, right?
[03:24:28] <ThKo> Right
[03:24:29] <Omar-> ThKo after that, you want to read database?
[03:24:35] <Kartagis> can you help?

[03:25:21] <caraconan> Yes
[03:25:54] <Omar-> caraconan which version?

[03:31:19] <ThKo> Omar-: onupgradeneeded and onsuccess … this are functions which are fired when databse is created
[03:31:50] <ThKo> In onupgradeneedet I fill in the records from a json file.
[03:32:20] <Omar-> ThKo good, but you want to read database before page is shwon?
[03:32:24] <caraconan> Omar-: but you need to create all that stuff to generate dynamically the popup? Why it's not enough just creating the HTML and append it to the <ul> ?
[03:32:34] <Mark___> how do i make the navigation come down from the top slowly, anybody knows?
[03:32:56] <Omar-> caraconan you dont need much code. i'll get you with a simple example
[03:33:14] <caraconan> Omar-: thanks, but what's wrong in my code?
[03:33:19] <ThKo> Omar-: Not necessarily…It would be enough when I can show my records. It’s the same if it „reloads“ the div when the page is shown.
[03:33:23] <caraconan> http://paste.debian.net/127787/
[03:33:34] <Omar-> caraconan this is not a popup, http://paste.debian.net/127787/ this is a listview
[03:34:24] <Omar-> ThKo are you using jqm 1.4?
[03:34:31] <ThKo> Yep
[03:34:55] <caraconan> Omar-: ok, but why the hardcoded html works?
[03:35:14] <caraconan> Omar-: "works" -> CSS is ok. If you tap the link, the popup appears
[03:35:32] <Omar-> ThKo then use pagecontainershow, $(document).on("pagecontainershow", function (e, data) { var currentPage = $(data.toPage)[0].id; if(currentPage == "pageID") { do something } });
[03:35:47] <ThKo> Omar-: great, I’ll try it. Thanks al ot :)
[03:36:01] <Omar-> caraconan because jQM enhances "static" html automatically
[03:36:18] <Omar-> for "dynamic" html, you have to enhance them manually
[03:36:47] <caraconan> Omar-: ok, very important lesson learned here. The problem is how to debug, since I'm using cordova + JQM on Android device
[03:36:58] <Omar-> caraconan another mistake in the code, popup shouldn't be placed inside any div but "page div"
[03:37:02] <caraconan> Omar-: ok, let me then try this example: http://jquery404.com/dynamic-popup-using-jquery-mobile/
[03:37:38] <Omar-> caraconan I hate cordova "palmface" haha
[03:37:54] <Omar-> caraconan there are two types of popups, internal and external
[03:37:59] <caraconan> Omar-: many thanks for your help, I will play a little bit
[03:38:06] <Omar-> internals are wrapped in "page div" not any other div
[03:38:23] <Omar-> external can be placed outside "page div"
[03:39:30] <Omar-> but requires manual enhancement
[03:39:38] <NikoZz> hi there
[03:39:53] <NikoZz> serialize() works only with forms?
[03:39:59] <NikoZz> and not with single text inputs?
[03:40:09] <caraconan> Omar-: ok, if I have a working static bunch of files working fine with a desktop browser, what's your suggestion regarding port the code to cordova + JQM?
[03:40:25] <caraconan> Omar-: this particular thing of popup is killing me
[03:40:52] <Omar-> caraconan I really haven't used cordova before, I dont know how it works
[03:41:11] <Omar-> caraconan popups are very easy, let me show you how
[03:41:21] <Omar-> give me 10 mins
[03:41:44] <caraconan> Omar-: many thanks
[03:48:06] <gnu_d> Cork: one more thing, how do I replace the sorted result in the $('#items') div ?
[03:48:20] <Cork> gnu_d: replace what?
[03:48:33] <Cork> just append/prepend the new list
[03:48:40] <Cork> or .html for that matter
[03:48:52] <Cork> gnu_d: dom elements doesn't clone unless you explicitly clone them
[03:53:19] <Omar-> caraconan http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/v7gumxz4/
[03:53:36] <caraconan> Omar-: having a look, many thanks
[03:55:04] <Omar-> np
[03:56:50] <Omar-> caraconan http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/v7gumxz4/1/ this will remove popup after it's closed
[03:59:07] <caraconan> Omar-: almost done, refactoring code. Many thank
[04:00:38] <Omar-> caraconan youre welcome :)
[04:01:34] <Omar-> caraconan if you have others widgets inside popup you need to use .enhanceWithin() to create the widgets
[04:01:41] <Omar-> .popup().enhanceWithin()
[04:01:49] <caraconan> Omar-: I'm going to cry... It's working at least. Many thanks
[04:01:50] <rindolf> Hi all. Can I do something like jQuery("tr.uploaded").each(function (i) { ... })?
[04:02:01] <gnu_d> Cork: how come using this code: $('#items').empty().append(results), after the first sorting, the second sorting doesn't work, i.e perhaps the .data is missing ?
[04:02:02] * Omar- hands caraconan tissues
[04:02:18] <Cork> gnu_d: why .empty???
[04:02:30] <Cork> just append them
[04:02:32] <Omar-> rindolf yes you can, or $.each($("tr.uploaded"), function () {}
[04:02:39] <caraconan> Omar-: can you please explain again why my approach was not correct with http://paste.debian.net/127787/?
[04:02:42] <gnu_d> Cork: won't append re add the same nodes ?
[04:02:45] <rindolf> Omar-: thanks!
[04:02:48] <rindolf> Omar-++
[04:02:49] <caraconan> Omar-: I don't want to face again same issue
[04:02:57] <Cork> gnu_d: <Cork> gnu_d: dom elements doesn't clone unless you explicitly clone them
[04:03:18] <Cork> gnu_d: so unless you do .clone() no there will only be one
[04:03:26] <gnu_d> Cork: aaa, I see
[04:03:52] <Cork> gnu_d: to dive a bit under the hood
[04:04:03] <gnu_d> Cork: cool, it's working :).
[04:04:12] <Cork> gnu_d: node trees is built by childrens parentId pointing to the parent node
[04:04:23] <Cork> gnu_d: as this is a pointer it can only point to one place
[04:04:34] <Omar-> caraconan as I said before, you cant place popup div inside other elements
[04:04:34] <Cork> so if you append it to a new location the pointer will be changed
[04:04:41] <Cork> and the element move from the old location
[04:04:45] <Omar-> it should be inside "page div"
[04:04:56] <gnu_d> Cork: I though that I append an object from the sorted list, and each node in the result is being recreated.
[04:05:40] <Cork> gnu_d: only html behaves like that
[04:05:47] <caraconan> Omar-: and as you said if I hardcode the html directly on the index.html JQM framework enhances the code to make it work, right?
[04:06:24] <gnu_d> Cork: ah, I understand now :), thanks for the brief explanation.
[04:06:34] <Omar-> caraconan yes it should work
[04:06:54] <caraconan> Omar-: many thanks
[04:07:03] <Omar-> np :)
[04:12:16] <caraconan> Omar-: sorry to insist again. The reason why my code was not working can't be the nested <div> inside other element
[04:12:46] <caraconan> Omar-: I tried generating the <li> and <div> of popups separated, but still not working
[04:13:13] <Omar-> caraconan yes, even hardcoded popup should be direct child of page div
[04:13:27] <Omar-> caraconan show me a sample on jsfiddle pls
[04:13:39] <caraconan> Ok, I'll need some time
[04:13:44] <Omar-> caraconan tyt
[04:22:59] <Mark___> can anyone tell me how i can give scroll down and up events on navigation ?
[04:23:00] <Mark___> like this page. https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/wd/mens
[04:23:58] <Omar-> Mark___ listen to "scroll" event
[04:34:25] <Mark___> can anyone take alook at this and tell me where to fix to get slide down and up effects?
[04:34:26] <Mark___> http://jsfiddle.net/gocsyebt/
[04:35:32] <Mark___> too difficult.
[04:35:33] <Cork> Mark___: define "fix"
[04:35:51] <Mark___> it has to come down from the top (slowly) when i scroll down
[04:36:03] <Mark___> and has to come up to the top when i reach the vey top of the page.
[04:36:15] <Mark___> *and disappear
[04:36:19] <Mark___> like this page
[04:36:27] <Mark___> https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/wd/mens
[04:36:58] <Mark___> i only got this far.. http://jsfiddle.net/wafh1w6o/
[04:37:07] <Mark___> i dont know how to program in query yet.
[04:37:36] <Mark___> rage quit and rage join
[04:39:03] <Cork> Mark___: http://jsfiddle.net/gocsyebt/1/ ?
[04:39:15] <Cork> opps still jumps
[04:41:15] <Mark___> i don’t see any difference.
[04:41:57] <Mark___> the only thing i need right now is emulating that navigation on the abercrombie site as best as i can
[04:42:24] <Kartagis> I am concetanating values, but if the page gives an additional error because of e-mail address validation, concatenation stops working
[04:42:30] <Kartagis> what to do?
[04:42:50] <Kartagis> brb, coffee o'clock
[04:43:17] <Cork> Mark___: btw why don't you use transition?
[04:43:29] <Mark___> im a newbie, i don’t know how lol
[04:43:43] <Mark___> im just picking up bunch of this and that
[04:43:50] <Mark___> and figuring out own my own what to do with em.
[04:43:54] <Mark___> it works only for me now.
[04:43:57] <Mark___> *okay
[04:44:20] <Mark___> but i need some help before i kick off.
[04:44:41] <Mark___> i just want the source of that navigation and will develop a website first before i really dive into hardcore
[04:47:40] <Kartagis> back
[04:50:46] <caraconan> Omar-: Obviously is not working yet, but this is what I would like to achieve: http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/mvjoko2a/1/
[04:52:09] <Cork> Mark___: not complete but it should get you going http://jsfiddle.net/gocsyebt/2/
[04:52:12] <caraconan> Omar-: Its ok to separate <li> and then <div> for popups, but this is not the reason why my code is not working: http://paste.debian.net/127787/ There should be something else...
[04:52:35] <Cork> Mark___: what you need to do is separate out the height: 0 so you can animate the original element after you're done
[04:52:50] <caraconan> Omar-: Basically I need to generate dynamically the part in the OK section of http://paste.debian.net/127787/
[04:53:02] <Cork> opps except i broke it at the end...
[04:53:34] <caraconan> Omar-: this is what I have at the moment: http://paste.debian.net/127889/ But the popup always appears in the center of the page
[04:53:35] <Cork> Mark___: the one i meant to give you: going http://jsfiddle.net/gocsyebt/3/
[04:53:45] <Omar-> caraconan i'll check it
[04:53:55] <caraconan> Omar-: many thanks
[04:55:22] <Mark___> much thanks, cork.
[04:56:14] <Cork> Mark___: another note some webkit browsers still use webkit prevised events for transition end
[04:56:18] <Cork> so you might have to fiddle there
[04:56:37] <Omar-> caraconan http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/88z9yvnp/ you mean like this?
[04:56:58] <Cork> Mark___: webkitTransitionEnd
[04:58:44] <caraconan> Omar-: ok, let's modify the code to create several href
[04:59:46] <caraconan> Omar-: and yes, more or less this is what is happening, no matter which <li> you click, the popup appears in the middle of the screen
[05:01:01] <Omar-> caraconan hold on, you want to open a popup, whike another popup is open?
[05:01:10] <Omar-> or you want to reposition the popup?
[05:01:51] <caraconan> Omar-: I passed the link in a PM to the JQM code that works great on a browser
[05:01:59] <caraconan> I need to port the code to cordova/phonegap
[05:02:05] <caraconan> And I'm stuck with popups
[05:03:08] <Omar-> caraconan http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/88z9yvnp/2/
[05:03:46] <caraconan> Omar-: many thanks, I'll try to reproduce it in my code
[05:03:47] <Omar-> i've added positionTo option
[05:03:57] <Omar-> $(this) = clicked element
[05:05:25] <caraconan> Omar-: I don't know how to appreciate your help, you saved me
[05:06:24] <Omar-> caraconan you can also override x,y positions
[05:06:57] <Omar-> caraconan http://stackoverflow.com/a/24078336/1771795
[05:07:01] <caraconan> Omar-: this is work for my colleague :). Many thanks again!
[05:07:16] <Omar-> caraconan me alegro :)
[05:07:30] <Omar-> de nada hombre
[05:07:30] <caraconan> jajaa great!
[05:07:35] <Omar-> ;)
[05:08:25] <caraconan> Omar-: line 9 of http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/88z9yvnp/ shouldn't be <div>?
[05:09:06] <caraconan> Omar-: anyway, don't want to bother you, I need to learn a lot yet
[05:09:55] <Omar-> caraconan no, its $("<div/>") = $("<div></div>")
[05:10:16] <caraconan> ok
[05:10:22] <Omar-> $("<div/>", { attributes here });
[05:10:44] <Omar-> i dont know what its called in programming languages hehe
[05:12:51] <Kartagis> okay, I have some 30 fields on a page. how can I concatenate their values, leaving some of them out?
[05:13:08] <Woet> Kartagis: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[05:13:26] <Woet> Kartagis: http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:13:27] <Woet> that last one.
[05:14:21] <Kartagis> Woet: that's what I thought, but how do I concat all of them?
[05:14:32] <Woet> by using basic javascript?
[05:14:48] <Woet> concatenating variables is not magic
[05:17:46] <Raydiation> hi, does $(document).ready all functions given to it?
[05:17:51] <Raydiation> +stack
[05:19:00] <Raydiation> ive got this code which works just fine http://jsfiddle.net/e9bg04g5/
[05:19:07] <Raydiation> it outputs yeah and hii
[05:19:31] <Raydiation> but when i include it in a project only the yeah is printed (the first console.log)
[05:21:48] <mdev> anyway to also get the top <tr>? even after a sort short of .each?
[05:22:24] <mdev> $("tr#whatever td").eq(0).html();
[05:22:35] <mdev> that gets the top one but if I sort it can be moved
[05:28:02] <ThKo> Hi everybody, short question: Why is arrRespon and arrResOpt in console.log „null“ though it’s defined global? http://jsfiddle.net/ztzbkejr/ Thanks a lot :-)
[05:29:35] <jadajada> Hi, what could it be that my jQuery code gets overwritten by something, even though I’ve inserted my script as the last script in a page? I’m trying to overwrite a link in a Woocommerce webshop. It does work, because I tried overwriting the text() too. The moment the page loads I can see the change, but then it reverts. What could this be?
[05:30:13] <rindolf> jadajada: does it happen in all browsers?
[05:30:15] <Cork> jadajada: prob cause they use the dom ready event
[05:30:25] <Cork> or onload event
[05:30:29] <jadajada> rindolf: Yes.
[05:30:39] <Cork> or it might be an ajax thing
[05:30:44] <Cork> hard to tell generically
[05:31:11] <jadajada> Is there a workaround for me? I can load a second jquery ready event?
[05:35:00] <Cork> jadajada: $(function() { /* your code */ });
[05:35:02] <Cork> might work
[05:35:23] <Cork> jadajada: alternatively $(window).on('load', function() { /* your code */ });
[05:35:36] <jadajada> Cork: thank you. I’ll try a few things.
[05:38:15] <Kartagis> can you give me a hint on how to concat all fields on a page, leaving a few out?
[05:39:31] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com serializeArray
[05:39:32] <b-ot> Cork: .serializeArray() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/serializearray/
[05:40:54] <sweet2k4> i want to bring up a popup window when user clicks login, i want the background to be grayed out and the window to be able to handle html etc, any good suggestions for a plugin to handle this well?
[05:41:18] <Cork> sweet2k4: there are plenty of options, just pick on you like
[05:41:24] <Cork> or you could go plain css
[05:42:00] <Kartagis> Cork: was that for me?
[05:42:18] <Cork> Kartagis: the bot response was yes
[05:42:35] <sweet2k4> Cork: well ok, so there isnt much diffirence between the options out here?
[05:43:02] <Cork> sweet2k4: there is, but it depends on what you need/want
[05:43:09] <sweet2k4> just thought someone had some experience with serval diffirent kinds and made up their mind about the best ones :)
[05:43:18] <Cork> there are good comparisons if you just look
[05:45:08] <jadajada> Cork: tried both of them, but without any luck. What could this be? Or how can I debug this sort of problem? What reverts my changes?
[05:45:23] <Cork> both??
[05:45:51] <jadajada> Yeah, the $(function() and $(windows).on(‘load’, function()
[05:46:07] <Cork> oh, sorry mixed up the nicks
[05:46:20] <Cork> jadajada: might be from an ajax call
[05:46:31] <basiclases> how do you guys test for css regression?
[05:46:32] <Cork> jadajada: this question can't be answered generically
[05:46:41] <Cork> basiclases: css regressions??
[05:46:41] <jadajada> Can I block an ajax call for a certain element?
[05:46:51] <Cork> jadajada: ajax, isn't related to an element
[05:46:55] <Cork> so no
[05:47:06] <jadajada> Well, can I block it at all?
[05:47:16] <Cork> sweet2k4: this one is quite commonly used you might be ok with it http://designresourcebox.com/snippet/lightbox-2-jquery-plugin/
[05:47:35] <Cork> jadajada: you could see if you could find the function doing it and overwrite it
[05:47:37] <basiclases> Cork: there are so many testing libraries out there, i dont know which to pick. by css regression i mean checking for visual differences between website versions
[05:47:49] <Cork> jadajada: this is all site specific it can't be generically answered
[05:47:56] <Cork> (like i said a few mins ago)
[05:48:03] <jadajada> Cork: no, ofcourse, I understand.
[05:48:07] <sweet2k4> Cork: alright, thanks il look into that one
[05:48:34] <Cork> basiclases: there are screenshot tools
[05:48:37] <Cork> and screen shot overlays
[05:48:51] <Cork> though i can't say i've ever seen a need for it
[05:51:32] <basiclases> Cork: yeh, ive got to point where it could be pretty useful, just wondering if anyone had any experience
[05:51:39] <basiclases> thanks anywho
[05:52:18] <Cork> basiclases: if you separate out styling from content and js it is normally not a problem
[05:53:57] <dave_4> how can i scroll to a specific div after click on button regardless of screensize (currently it scroll to different area) than the div
[05:54:21] <Cork> dave_4: either use the scrollTo plugin
[05:54:41] <Cork> or grab position().top and .left and change scrollTop and scrollLeft to that
[05:55:32] <Kartagis> jQuery('input').bind('input',function(i) { con.val(i.append + " ");}) <--- what have I done wrong here?
[05:55:51] <Cork> uh
[05:55:55] <Cork> con i??
[05:56:02] <Cork> i is event
[05:56:08] <Cork> not sure what con is
[05:56:15] <Kartagis> con is my field
[05:56:30] <Cork> a field you want to update when the event fires?
[05:56:48] <Kartagis> yes,
[05:57:01] <Kartagis> I want to concat all fields into that
[05:57:04] <dave_4> Cork i tried using scrollTo plugin but it scroll to different area after screen resize and create weird space on right hand side of screen
[05:57:36] <Cork> Kartagis: you really need to learn the basics instead of expecting others to write the code for you...
[05:57:36] <mdev> nice
[05:57:51] <Cork> the code you have there makes absolutely no sense
[05:58:15] <Cork> dave_4: hmm, weird never had that
[06:00:34] <dave_4> Cork this is the site http://www.imagefix.co.uk/whitedem_02/ what i just want when i click on the button over slider it stop above request a visit heading regardless of screensize, how can i achieve it any help on that
[06:01:42] <Cork> dave_4: what heading?
[06:01:52] <Cork> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Request a Visit</h3> <-- this one?
[06:02:04] <dave_4> Cork yeah right above that
[06:02:19] <Cork> do you have a tartget element you fancy?
[06:04:08] <dave_4> right now i was trying to do it with scrollintoview plugin, i've a div over there #scroll-area
[06:06:31] <bbclover> should I always wrap my jquery in $(document).ready()?
[06:06:37] <bbclover> even if it's just a simple 1 line thing?
[06:06:45] <Cork> dave_4: jQuery([window, document.body]).animate({ scrollTop: jQuery('#scroll-area').position().top }, 500);
[06:07:09] <Cork> bbclover: if it is meant to touch the dom and run on page load
[06:07:36] <bbclover> it will touch the dom but it's only if the user opens a certain dialog I have
[06:07:51] <bbclover> I imagine they won't be able to get to that before the document is ready, if you know what I mean
[06:08:00] <Cork> bbclover: if it is code that runs from a user action, like a function declaration then no
[06:08:01] <dmsuperman> dave_4: I just pasted this into my console on your site while I was at the very top and it scrolled me to the 4 column items you have listed: jQuery('body').animate({ scrollTop: jQuery('.wpb_wrapper').offset().top }, 1000);
[06:08:08] <Cork> if it binds an event yes
[06:08:28] <Cork> dmsuperman: sounds way to generic though
[06:08:36] <bbclover> it's just to check a checkbox if a certain variable is true
[06:08:39] <Cork> .wpb_wrapper is a generic wordpress class
[06:08:42] <dmsuperman> of course
[06:08:45] <dmsuperman> I'm just demonstrating it works
[06:08:48] <dmsuperman> jQuery('body').animate({ scrollTop: jQuery('#scroll-area').offset().top }, 1000);  is also fine
[06:08:49] <Cork> bbclover: then it touches the dom
[06:09:21] <Cork> dmsuperman: except it breaks for browsers that doesn't have the scrollbars on body
[06:09:24] <Mark___> can i get some help on this : http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/board_lPQY33
[06:09:29] <dmsuperman> html,body then
[06:09:30] <Mark___> it has some glitch.
[06:09:38] <dmsuperman> the point is to demonstrate that it works.
[06:09:50] <dmsuperman> and doesn't do any weird whitespace issue that he commented about from that plugin
[06:09:53] <Cork> dmsuperman: so did i 5 mins ago :)
[06:10:08] <dmsuperman> k
[06:10:10] <Mark___> it blinks a lot, and when it reaches the very top it pushes off other body contents
[06:10:11] * dmsuperman shrugs
[06:10:39] <Mark___> can i make the top layer just stay on even after i scroll down?
[06:10:57] <dave_4> Cork it changes as the screeen size changes :(
[06:11:13] <dave_4> dmsuperman let me try that one
[06:11:18] <Cork> dave_4: shouldn't matter unless you do some magi
[06:11:20] <dmsuperman> mine is the same as his, I just missed it
[06:11:28] <Cork> cause that code i gave you grabs the position from the dom
[06:11:49] <Cork> Mark___: it comes from your moving the element to position fixed
[06:11:56] <Cork> Mark___: this causes the page to jump up
[06:12:02] <Cork> and that is why things flicker
[06:12:21] <Kartagis> if ((".page-node-add-corporate").length > 0) { <--- I'm working on the page with this class, but another code within another block works. how come?
[06:12:23] <Mark___> so how can i fix it…?
[06:12:30] <Cork> Mark___: the only way around it is to either have a placeholder or duplicate the menu
[06:12:47] <Kartagis> Mark___: position:fixed;
[06:12:53] <Cork> O_o
[06:12:55] <Mark___> hmmm...
[06:12:55] <dave_4> Cork & dmsuperman so is there any way i can achieve that?
[06:12:55] <frank_o> Hi! Slightly off topic, but which of these two selection schemes do you guys feel would be more usable on mobile? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/1ym9t70b/6/show
[06:12:57] <Mark___> i’ll try.
[06:13:17] <Cork> dave_4: you have to figure out what you do to make the dom lie to you
[06:13:23] <Cork> i've never experienced it before
[06:13:52] <Mark___> fixed it, but it still blinks ;)
[06:13:53] <Mark___> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/board_lPQY33
[06:14:14] <Mark___> so i will have to duplicate the menu then..
[06:14:44] <Cork> Mark___: seams like something is wrong with the css rules you apply
[06:15:01] <dmsuperman> dave_4: achieve what? again, the code supplied works just fine. what are the circumstances where it doesn't?
[06:15:02] <Cork> cause when the transition ends it looks like the element jumps back to height: 0
[06:15:12] <dmsuperman> dave_4: even when I resize the window and run the code again, still works fine
[06:15:34] <Cork> dmsuperman: it appears that when he resizes the browser or something things break
[06:15:51] <Cork> ah, i think i know what it might be
[06:16:04] <Cork> if the page overflows so the content takes more height
[06:16:11] <Cork> things will jump out of the view
[06:16:20] <Cork> as scrollTop doesn't care where it the content you are
[06:16:27] <Cork> that might be what he means
[06:16:52] <Cork> dave_4: am i guessing right here?
[06:16:58] <dave_4> dmsuperman code runs fine, but what i want is, that it should always stop over request a visit heading either i resize browser window
[06:17:28] <Cork> dave_4: and the resize problem isn't that when clicking the button you end up at the wrong place?
[06:17:43] <Cork> it is that when you resize they don't stay at the target?
[06:18:02] <dave_4> exactly it don't stop at the target
[06:18:16] <Cork> ok, that has absolutely nothing to do with that code
[06:18:34] <Cork> dave_4: you have to figure out a way to track if you should be at that position
[06:18:46] <Cork> and on window resize check if scrollTop is on the wrong position
[06:19:02] <Cork> dave_4: scroll is a fixed value from the top of the page
[06:19:09] <Mark___> god, jquery is so difficult.
[06:19:10] <Cork> if you resize so content take more space
[06:19:15] <dmsuperman> is the problem that it scrolls past the heading?
[06:19:18] <Cork> this will change that
[06:19:19] <dmsuperman> that's because your floating header covers it up
[06:19:23] <dmsuperman> so add the difference of the header?
[06:19:38] <Mark___> done nothing 3 days in a row
[06:21:05] <dave_4> dmsuper yeah it scroll past the heading, currently i'm using scrollintoview plugin
[06:21:28] <dmsuperman> well when I look at the #scroll-area div and inspect it, it's not at the heading
[06:21:42] <dmsuperman> it's farther down
[06:21:56] <dmsuperman> the jquery code correctly scrolls to #scroll-area, #scroll-area just isn't where you expect it to be
[06:22:58] <dmsuperman> dave_4: http://i.imgur.com/lnWPKmW.png
[06:23:48] <dmsuperman> so you have to fix the position of your #scroll-area first before the code works. but also as I mentioned you're going to want to take the header into account with the scroll position since it's floating at the top
[06:23:49] <dave_4> ok so how can i make #scroll-area to always stay above that, css position will do ?
[06:24:08] <dmsuperman> that my friend is a question for #css ;)
[06:25:01] <dave_4> hahaha exactly thank you though, this is what i'm trying that scroll always stops there, now i've to stop #scroll-area at right position :P
[06:25:41] <dmsuperman> my guess is that you're going to need to use a clearfix
[06:25:47] <dmsuperman> not sure though
[06:25:53] <dmsuperman> I tend to hate css :D
[06:27:08] <dmsuperman> anyway once you fix your #scroll-area you'll want to use this as the options argument for jQuery.animate to take the header into account: { scrollTop: (jQuery('#scroll-area').offset().top - jQuery('#tt-header-wrap').height()) }
[06:27:19] <dmsuperman> good luck
[06:27:46] <Mark___> does anybody use mac here?
[06:27:59] <Mark___> i need to install the os 10.10 first before i get going
[06:28:02] <Mark___> too buggy.
[06:29:19] <BillCriswell> Mark___: Many do in here I believe.
[06:31:20] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/2rvj76ru/1/ <--- I'm getting undefined is not a function here, but in jquery.min.js :S
[06:31:58] <Cork> Kartagis: field is undefined
[06:32:07] <Cork> Kartagis: and you can't append to a replaced element (input)
[06:33:40] <dmsuperman> and why are you adding an empty string? :/
[06:34:27] <Mark___> cork :// are you a webdeveloper?
[06:34:39] <Mark___> you seem to know a bit about jquery and on
[06:34:47] <Cork> Mark___: no i hang here for fun...
[06:34:55] <Cork> isn't that kinda obvious?
[06:35:33] <Mark___> oh well.
[06:35:36] <Mark___> good for me.
[06:36:03] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/2rvj76ru/2/ is this what you're shooting for?
[06:36:18] <Mark___> i need to reboot for osx dp6
[06:36:21] <Mark___> sec.
[06:36:28] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsfiddle.net/2rvj76ru/3/
[06:36:41] <BillCriswell> Interesting guy.
[06:37:05] <Kartagis> me? yes I am
[06:37:17] <BillCriswell> No, Mark___
[06:37:38] <BillCriswell> Your questions make sense haha
[06:37:43] <BillCriswell> Well, mostly.
[06:37:50] <Kartagis> his don't?
[06:38:35] <BillCriswell> I shouldn't say they don't make sense. They seem out of place.
[06:38:41] <BillCriswell> Maybe he wasn't aware of the channel he was in.
[06:44:20] <Kartagis> heh
[06:44:57] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: your code gave me all the invisible inputs as well :D
[06:45:20] <dmsuperman> His fiddle gave me 3 inputs with their values filled in
[06:45:23] <dmsuperman> 1, 2, 12
[06:45:50] <Kartagis> dmsuperman: seems I have a lot of hidden inputs
[06:46:45] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: filter them out
[06:47:17] <BillCriswell> Assuming you don't want them... whatever you're doing though it doesnt sound like you're taking the most ideal approach.
[06:48:35] <Kartagis> jQuery("input").not("input[type='hidden']").not(con).each(function() { con.val(con.val() + '' + this.value); }); <--- I am doing this
[06:49:30] <Cork> Kartagis: no need for the + '' +
[06:49:35] <Cork> but yes
[06:49:53] <Cork> just do con.val(con.val() + this.value)
[06:50:05] <Cork> Kartagis: value and .val() always returns a string
[06:51:29] <Kartagis> Cork: I want to space delimit them
[06:52:03] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/2rvj76ru/4/ <--- isn't this correct?
[06:52:13] <Cork> so basically you want con.val(jQuery.map(jQuery("input").not("input[type='hidden']").not(con), function(elm) { return elm.valu; }).join(' '))
[06:52:28] <Cork> *value
[06:52:42] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: '' is not a space
[06:53:12] <dmsuperman> Cork: why not .not(':hidden') out of curiousity?
[06:53:18] <dmsuperman> mild performance gain?
[06:53:23] <Cork> dmsuperman: no reason
[06:53:29] <Cork> i jus copied his filter code
[06:53:34] <dmsuperman> ah :P
[06:54:23] <Cork> : selectors is normally bad for performance, but that is mainly if they have selector code to the right of them
[06:54:24] <gnarf> dmsuperman: i think :hidden is not [type='hidden']
[06:54:33] <Cork> ah, true
[06:54:49] <Cork> :hidden checks display: none and visibility: hidden
[06:55:01] <dmsuperman> true. I just like the way it looks more and this seems like a one-off lookup
[06:55:01] <gnarf> :hidden has to do with display none/block though i think :hidden will actually catch the input because it has a width of 0
[06:55:05] <dmsuperman> not something to be run a thousand times
[06:55:49] <Cork> dmsuperman: so in this case attribute selector is needed
[06:56:18] <dmsuperman> well, technically not. :hidden finds hidden inputs. but in a roundabout way. I agree not the best practice to teach beginners
[06:57:08] <Cork> dmsuperman: no they don't
[06:57:35] <dmsuperman>  $('<input type="hidden">').is(':hidden')  returns true
[06:57:54] <dmsuperman> even if I append it to the body
[06:58:06] <Cork> weird
[06:59:28] <gnarf> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/2rvj76ru/5/
[06:59:38] <dmsuperman> ultimately I believe hidden inputs get visibility: none or display: none from the browser's base CSS rules
[06:59:44] <dmsuperman> it's a cheat
[07:00:05] <gnarf> dmsuperman: they do kind of - but its the fact that it has width of 0 that it counts as hidden
[07:00:13] <dmsuperman> ah, there we go
[07:00:15] <dmsuperman> thanks gnarf
[07:00:15] <Cork> ah tricky
[07:00:32] <Cork> they've extendended the check since last i checked
[07:00:50] <Cork> elem.offsetWidth <= 0 && elem.offsetHeight <= 0 <-- this wasn't there last i checked
[07:01:14] <gnarf> dmsuperman: Cork:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/css/hiddenVisibleSelectors.js
[07:01:49] <Cork> O_o
[07:02:03] <Cork> gnarf: that code looks different then the one on code.jquery.com
[07:02:28] <gnarf> Cork: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.x-master/src/css/hiddenVisibleSelectors.js
[07:02:38] <Cork> ah
[07:02:39] <gnarf> that was from 2.x --- maybe you were looking at the 1.x branch?
[07:02:42] <Cork> right
[07:02:52] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js so ya
[07:19:39] <caraconan> Omar-: I'm refactoring the code, but I'm sure that I'm missing something: http://paste.debian.net/127939/
[07:21:23] <lilsammy> I have a selector by class right, but how would I get that selector if say the parent of the parent had an ID = to whatever.
[07:22:00] <lilsammy> var parentDiv = $(".fc-agenda-slots:visible").parent();    but only like where the parent, parent parent ID = "someID"
[07:22:19] <lilsammy> because i have 2 of those and its selecting the wrong one
[07:22:33] <dmsuperman> lilsammy: $('#parent .some-child')
[07:22:40] <dmsuperman> it's a standard CSS query
[07:22:45] <lilsammy> oh I feel retarded, thanks man
[07:22:50] <dmsuperman> no prob :)
[07:23:25] <lilsammy> but will that be only one parent of parent will I need to list all child ID's and classes if its more than one parent?
[07:23:59] <dmsuperman> not sure I understand
[07:24:47] <dmsuperman> that selector will find all elements matching class="some-child" but only the ones that exist inside of a node with id="parent"
[07:25:21] <lilsammy> right thats what I was asking thanks :) but if a element has no ID or class can I use the tag name?
[07:25:34] <dmsuperman> lilsammy: like $('div .some-children') ?
[07:25:41] <lilsammy> nvm I will go try :) thanks
[07:25:45] <dmsuperman> that would find only class="some-children" inside of divs
[07:26:07] <dmsuperman> basing it on tag isn't ideal though, an id or class would be better. and more efficient
[07:29:02] <lilsammy> That first one worked well thanks a lot for the help
[07:31:34] <dmsuperman> no prob
[07:32:16] <gnarf> dmsuperman: tag is actually pretty effecient too
[07:32:45] <gnarf> just not very "specific" :)
[07:32:59] <dmsuperman> I'm sure. just less efficient than an ID lookup no?
[07:33:23] <dmsuperman> I guess maybe class vs tag might be arguable
[07:34:03] <gnarf> ID is >usually< fastest, class and tag pretty much tie - but really "efficiency" amongst any of these three is not going to be a bottleneck
[07:34:12] <BeWilled> How can I resize the height, and pixels of a button as the screen gets smaller?
[07:34:37] <gnarf> BeWilled: media queries and css?
[07:34:54] <dmsuperman> indeed
[07:35:04] <dmsuperman> css is the right answer there imo
[07:35:33] <gnarf> BeWilled: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries
[07:35:40] <gnarf> `media query
[07:35:50] <gnarf> `mdn media query
[07:35:52] <b-ot> gnarf: CSS media queries - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries
[07:35:57] <BeWilled> gnarf, No
[07:36:04] <gnarf> BeWilled: yes
[07:36:06] <BeWilled> gnarf, I don't need media queries
[07:36:14] <dmsuperman> oh, well then, by all means
[07:36:17] <dmsuperman> you tell us the answer :)
[07:36:18] <BeWilled> gnarf, I want it to resize real time
[07:36:25] <dmsuperman> yes that's correct
[07:36:31] <caraconan> Hi there. Do somebody know why each time that the popup opens the inner <div> is selected? http://paste.debian.net/127939/ Thanks
[07:36:32] <gnarf> BeWilled: media queries will do that
[07:36:32] <BeWilled> like an image
[07:36:36] <dmsuperman> take a look at twitter bootstrap
[07:36:43] <dmsuperman> or similar "responsive" frameworks
[07:36:50] <gnarf> they re-evaluate every time the window resizes
[07:37:11] <dmsuperman> they use media queries to accomplish the goal
[07:37:35] <gnarf> if you want it to be a % of the screen size - you can use relative widths and heights to it's container in % and/or toy around with calc()
[07:37:43] <axilla> i'd recommend foundations over bootstrap
[07:37:51] <axilla> for responsive frameworks :)
[07:38:20] <dmsuperman> I wasn't recommending the use of any framework. I would recommend a person do their own research to see which framework suits them best rather than blindly picking one because somebody on irc likes that one most
[07:38:24] <axilla> but that's like my opinion man
[07:38:48] <gnarf> BeWilled: of course, you could always var win = $(window); win.on('resize', function() { win.height(); win.width(); })
[07:38:50] <axilla> just giving him another option.. i'd make my choice between those two.
[07:39:13] <dmsuperman> gnarf: nooooo ;)
[07:39:25] <gnarf> axilla: lets not assume genders please
[07:39:38] <dmsuperman> just giving it another option*
[07:39:43] <dmsuperman> let's not assume species
[07:40:17] <gnarf> BeWilled: though i would highly suggest >not< doing that, and if you do end up needing to do that, you should "debouce" that resize event, and also cache the hell out of everything... it takes quite a bit of "work" to reflow the document when resizing
[07:40:30] <gnarf> `debounce
[07:40:39] <maloik> Considering a list of li elements with data attributes, how can I get an array of a certain data attribute from all of those? The elements all have "data-option-number" with their values being "option-1", "option-2" etc... I want to end up with a string "1,2,3" or so but I suppose the array will be the first step
[07:40:57] <BeWilled> thanks gnarf
[07:40:57] <dmsuperman> first get an array of the elements
[07:41:10] <dmsuperman> then forEach (or $.each) the array, and read the data attribute
[07:41:13] <dmsuperman> and read that into your array
[07:41:27] <dmsuperman> then optionally use Array.join to make your CSV
[07:41:30] <gnarf> maloik: $('li[data-option-number]').map(function() { return $(this).data('option-number').replace(/^option-/, ''); }).get().join(',');
[07:41:38] <dmsuperman> you're no fun gnarf
[07:41:56] <maloik> dmsuperman: I'd been trying that but to no avail... got errors in console
[07:42:03] <maloik> let me see what I'm getting with that :-)
[07:42:46] <maloik> didn't even know .map() was available, I thought that required extra libs to be loaded
[07:43:45] <BillCriswell> jQuery has had map for ages. Lots of useful things in there. =)
[07:43:52] <duce1nik> hello
[07:45:11] <duce1nik> I’m trying to create a checkbox list from IndexedDB  but after   The result is not being style. How can I get can I get the result to be Style by JQuery mobile.
[07:47:11] <Omar-> duce1nik .checkboxradio() to enhance it
[07:47:12] <maloik> gnarf: works perfectly btw, thank you!
[07:47:42] <Omar-> duce1nik or call .enhanceWithin() on parent div/wrapping div
[07:47:50] <Omar-> in case you're using jQM 1.4
[07:49:42] <gnarf> `api map @maloik
[07:49:42] <b-ot> maloik: .map(): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[07:50:08] <gnarf> we've had .map on jQuery objects forever - but it returns a jQuery object, not a real array, hence the follow up .get()
[07:50:14] <gnarf> `api get @maloik
[07:50:14] <b-ot> maloik: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[07:50:36] <duce1nik> omar   document.querySelector('#deleteList').enhanceWithin();  I try this not working
[07:50:56] <Omar-> duce1nik $('#deleteList').enhanceWithin();
[07:51:04] <Omar-> (((jQM 1.4)))
[07:51:44] <duce1nik> omar thank bor
[07:51:45] <duce1nik> bro
[07:51:50] <duce1nik> or sis ahhaha
[07:51:53] <Omar-> you're welcome
[07:52:04] <Omar-> :)
[07:52:51] <caraconan> Omar-: I'm refactoring the code, but I'm sure that I'm missing something: http://paste.debian.net/127939/
[07:53:06] <Omar-> caraconan i'll take a look
[07:53:28] <caraconan> Omar-: basically the main issue is that the <div> of the popup is being selected automatically
[07:54:17] <maloik> gnarf: interesting, thanks
[07:55:16] <Omar-> caraconan what do you mean by selected automatically?
[07:55:42] <Omar-> caraconan and btw, since it's dynamic, you should remove it once closed.
[07:56:05] <caraconan> Omar-: let me paste you the new version (almost the same)
[07:56:45] <Omar-> popup.popup({ afterclose: function () { $(this).remove(); }, "positionTo": $(obj) });
[07:56:49] <Omar-> ok
[07:56:51] <caraconan> Omar-: http://paste.debian.net/127939/
[07:57:08] <caraconan> Omar-: pure cosmetic, but otherwise I will not understand the code
[07:57:42] <caraconan> Omar-: what I mean is that after click on the <a href> of the <li> the popup opens, but it gains the focus
[07:58:11] <caraconan> Omar-: now with a <p> this is not an issue, but in the final version the popup will be a <ul> with several <li>
[07:58:14] <Omar-> caraconan this is the default behavior
[07:58:43] <Omar-> if you click outside it, it'll be close in case "data-dismissible=true"
[07:59:19] <csd_> How can I make a dynamic <add item> feature to a table list? I'd like it where clicking a link adds an additional row, the row has editable fields, after which I'd then dispatch an ajax command to create a db entry
[07:59:51] <caraconan> Omar-: let me paste you the code which is working fine, 1 sec
[08:01:15] <ash_m> for a slideshow that has lots of little animations of vector graphics on each slide would you use css3 animations, canvas, svg animations or just plain jquery?
[08:02:18] <gnarf> in this day and age, i generally suggest against using jQuery animations unless you really need old browser support - most things support css3 nowadays and the fallback is no animation
[08:02:46] <gnarf> w/r/t canvas or svg or etc, - whatever you end up using to get your "animations"
[08:03:28] <caraconan> Omar-: version works ok -> http://paste.debian.net/127948/
[08:03:37] <gnarf> ash_m: http://snapsvg.io/demos/#game
[08:03:44] <caraconan> Omar-: version with issue with focus -> http://paste.debian.net/127946/
[08:03:58] <jphase> good morning/afternoon/evening ladies/gentlemen/other :)
[08:04:30] <dmsuperman> csd_: by writing it :)
[08:04:35] <ash_m> gnarf: that's very interesting, but that doesn't quite answer my question
[08:04:54] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I got the shirt and stickers.
[08:04:54] <ash_m> gnarf: sorry, reading up
[08:05:17] <caraconan> Omar-: another difference is that the selector is unique, but I don't think this is relevant ("#li-category-" + id)
[08:05:24] <gnarf> ash_m: the actual answer is very nuanced - basically, svg is good for vectors, so i'd probably do most of it with some svg animaiton library
[08:05:35] <csd_> dmsuperman: I think I'm more hung up on how to have the text formatted the way I want it. I don't want it to look like a stock field, but more like text shaded differently that on click becomes editable. Not sure if that's a jQuery thing or CSS
[08:05:40] <gnarf> but the "slideshow" component might be easier with raw css and dom elements ash_m
[08:05:40] <Omar-> caraconan i'm trying to figure out the difference
[08:06:04] <dmsuperman> csd_: http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/  ?
[08:06:06] <Omar-> caraconan both should do the same thing and it's normal for popup to gain focus
[08:06:07] <ash_m> gnarf: do you ever get concerned about compatibility when using svgs?
[08:06:10] <dmsuperman> that's what I usually use for something like that
[08:06:17] <dmsuperman> or you could roll your own something similar
[08:06:31] <dmsuperman> the dotted underline seems fairly universal as a way to indicate that the text is editable though
[08:06:39] <dmsuperman> I've seen some people just turn the node into a contenteditable field
[08:06:39] <gnarf> ash_m: there are a few features of svg that aren't supported cross-browser well, but not really - SVG works in most modern browsers
[08:06:42] <gnarf> `caniuse svg
[08:06:42] <b-ot> gnarf: You can use SVG (basic support) with: Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 3, Chrome 4, Safari 3.2, Opera 9, iOS Safari 3.2, Opera Mini 5.0-7.0, and Opera Mobile 10. http://caniuse.com/#search=svg
[08:07:09] <Omar-> caraconan in first code, popup doesn't gain focus and on second code it gains focus?
[08:07:12] <csd_> dmsuperman: that should do, thanks!
[08:07:17] <dmsuperman> no problem
[08:07:31] <caraconan> Omar-: paste.debian.net/127946/ -> gains focus http://paste.debian.net/127948/ -> does not
[08:07:57] <ash_m> gnarf: yeah, I was looking at that. Suppose you have a slide where it's raining images that are vector based, would you use svgs or pngs?
[08:08:21] <Omar-> caraconan you dont want it to gain focus?
[08:08:29] <gnarf> ash_m: either - depends very much on the situation and the images and the sizes and the number of elements you need
[08:08:31] <printForever> guys, need some help with this
[08:08:41] <printForever> I'm running this code http://pastebin.com/MPtyAtCG
[08:08:51] <printForever> but it reports that I'm missing a semicolon
[08:08:56] <printForever> I triple checked the code
[08:08:59] <printForever> and its fine
[08:09:08] <caraconan> Omar-: the thing is that with version paste.debian.net/127946/ the first <li> element is automatically selected
[08:09:28] <caraconan> Omar-: there should be something wrong with getActivePage I guess....
[08:09:39] <gnarf> printForever: line 2 --- $function ?
[08:09:47] <printForever> gnarf?
[08:09:56] <gnarf> printForever: should be $(function ?
[08:10:01] <printForever> oh God...
[08:10:23] <printForever> SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[08:10:29] <printForever> I'm going crazy
[08:11:37] <caraconan> Omar-: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.4/popup/ if you see the examples here, the popup does not "gain the focus" (meaning that a click event is fired)
[08:11:55] <Omar-> caraconan i'll double check my code
[08:11:58] <ash_m> gnarf: hmm... well, I'm always pro svgs just for their scalability. The images are all simple enough, but I was wondering about actually getting them onto the show. I thougth I could make an svg sprite and have a bunch of <use> elements; but I couldn't get css animations working on them properly...
[08:12:34] <gnarf> ash_m: thats extended svg spec (use, etc...) probably not going to work very well
[08:12:50] <ash_m> gnarf: I see
[08:13:01] <caraconan> Omar-: many thanks
[08:13:13] <printForever> TypeError: document.url.indexOf is not a function
[08:13:17] <gnarf> but yeah - svg has a bunch of features most of which you can't use very easily - but there are a lot of libraries that help wrap it all up
[08:13:26] * printForever facepalming, hard
[08:13:28] <gnarf> printForever: location.href.indexOf() ?
[08:13:54] <printForever> gnarf, I'll try
[08:14:01] <gnarf> printForever: also, var document.url ???
[08:14:05] <gnarf> ^^^ illegal
[08:14:20] <gnarf> var docUrl = location.href; ... docUrl.indexOf()...
[08:14:36] * printForever I dont know what I'm doing
[08:15:38] <gnarf> kind of obvious by that giant if/else with 100 selectors each :)
[08:15:49] <printForever> grarf... well...
[08:16:03] <printForever> its not 100 selectors :P but I was close
[08:16:12] <Omar-> caraconan I made a mistake in the very first fiddle. "positionTo": $(this) is incorrect
[08:16:19] <Omar-> $(this) = popup itself
[08:16:19] <printForever> btw. the code isn't chanign anything on IF
[08:16:21] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/2cctqLaa/
[08:16:39] <gnarf> also you duplicate selects alot... $("#lamm_products a").html(); $("#lamm_products a").attr(); can just be $("#lamm_products a").html().attr()
[08:16:55] <dmsuperman> or at least store it in a variable and reference later
[08:16:59] <Omar-> caraconan http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/2cctqLaa/ I have defined a var that holds clicked element btn = $(this) /* clicked li */
[08:17:04] <printForever> gnarf, I didn't know I could do it like that
[08:17:05] <dmsuperman> re-running the selector is bad practice though
[08:17:16] <gnarf> `cache
[08:17:19] <caraconan> Omar-: I'll integrate the code. Many thanks
[08:17:19] <ash_m> gnarf: would a base64 svg background image be a better idea?
[08:17:24] <printForever> still learning
[08:17:35] <printForever> why isn't my IF statement working
[08:17:37] <ash_m> gnarf: kind of mimic the idea of spriting
[08:17:40] <Omar-> caraconan not much of a code, minor tweak :)
[08:17:44] <gnarf> ash_m: base64 kind of silly for svg - actually takes more characters than utf8 ;)
[08:17:50] <printForever> the domain name has /de after its name
[08:17:52] <printForever> it should work
[08:18:37] <gnarf> though it does stop you from needing to triple check that you use only one quote
[08:18:47] <gnarf> ' or " so you can wrap the data uri in the other
[08:19:11] <gnarf> but yeah - i use data-uri svg now and then
[08:19:28] <gnarf> printForever: console.log(docUrl) ?
[08:19:56] <gnarf> printForever: the line at line 5 will match for all of them you know?
[08:20:02] <printForever> gnarf I have no idea what you wrote :(
[08:20:10] <gnarf> printForever: console.log?
[08:20:11] <caraconan> Omar-: still the same, one of the options get automatically selected
[08:20:15] <printForever> gnarf, oh crap
[08:20:36] <gnarf> `fixingthesejquery @printForever
[08:20:43] <gnarf> `ftj
[08:20:45] <Omar-> caraconan ok, remove "positionTo" and try again
[08:20:55] <gnarf> printForever: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[08:21:08] <caraconan> ok
[08:21:49] <printForever> gnarf: tnx for the slides, I'll try to get something out of it
[08:22:16] <printForever> gnarf: my IF statements are correct, but nothing is changed
[08:24:04] <printForever> ReferenceError: docurl is not defined
[08:24:04] <printForever> console.log(docurl)
[08:24:46] <caraconan> Omar-: interesting. If I remove the position: 1. The popup is being opened in the center 2. It selects the inner content as usual 3. It removes the parent <a> element
[08:25:45] <printForever> gnarf: I'm getting no errors
[08:26:09] <caraconan> Omar-: anyway many thanks for your help. I will read you later in case that you come back with something else. I will attend my family guy dutties now
[08:26:10] <gnarf> printForever: set some breakpoints, make sure things have values you expect them too, that your selectors are finding things, etc
[08:27:04] <Duce1nik> how do I bind or addEventListener after I injected a new element?
[08:27:10] <Omar-> caraconan lol, because $(this) = the pressed button, its crazy
[08:27:28] <gnarf> Duce1nik: bind to it after you inject the new element?
[08:27:53] <Omar-> caraconan can you try it outside cordova? maybe it's caused by it
[08:28:12] <gnarf> Duce1nik: also - check out event delegation?  bind to a parent element and catch all events on current and future children elements
[08:28:14] <printForever> gnarf, I'm expecting jquery to get the current website address, and if it has country code (NL, DE, RU, ...) to apply the IF
[08:28:23] <printForever> what am I doing wrong?
[08:29:05] <printForever> gnarf, can you give me an example on how it should be done?
[08:29:06] <gnarf> printForever: that's just plain old JavaScript btw --- hard for me to say exactly what you're doing wrong, i'm not running your code on your site, and looking in the debugger... have you tried stepping through the code yet?
[08:29:33] <Omar-> caraconan anyway, there are many ways to center http://stackoverflow.com/a/19638417/1771795
[08:29:35] <Duce1nik> for example:  I'm creating a UL list from a database and need to bind a event when it is click
[08:29:38] <gnarf> does the location.href have the value you expect, does .indexOf() return what you expect?
[08:29:56] <gnarf> Duce1nik: so you create the element, then .on('click', doSomething)
[08:30:36] <printForever> gnarf, how can I check that?
[08:30:44] <printForever> can I write it in the console?
[08:30:50] <gnarf> or you can bind to a parent early (delegated) and catch all clicks on future stuff like $(parent).on('click','ul.fromDatabase li', doSomething)
[08:31:11] <gnarf> printForever if you put a breakpoint in your code, you can step through it, and check values in the console or in the sides of your debugger
[08:31:20] <Duce1nik> thank let me give that a try
[08:31:42] <printForever> gnarf, when I see the page, and open Firebug, all of the code is messed up
[08:31:47] <printForever> gnarf, its unredable
[08:31:57] <gnarf> sounds like you're using a minifier?
[08:32:27] <gnarf> chrome might be able to map back to original source if sourcemapping is turned on
[08:32:47] <printForever> gnarf, I'm trying to conduct an AB test with Optimizely
[08:33:07] <printForever> gnarf, I guess they are minifying the code when its served to the page
[08:33:22] <printForever> is there a way I can type something into the console and get a result?
[08:33:32] <printForever> for example: console.location.href
[08:33:35] <printForever> or something...
[08:33:41] <gnarf> location.href
[08:33:45] <gnarf> its not on console
[08:33:48] <gnarf> why would you think that?
[08:33:58] <gnarf> it's actually window.location
[08:34:02] <printForever> gnarf, no formal training
[08:34:08] <gnarf> but that means its also just location
[08:34:12] <embe> as for code readability try this: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks#prettyprint-javascript
[08:34:22] <gnarf> cuz window is the global namespace in DOM based JS
[08:34:58] <printForever> location.href returns just the url
[08:35:06] <printForever> window.location returns a lot of things
[08:36:13] <printForever> why do I get numbers 23, 24, 5
[08:36:15] <printForever> as results
[08:36:24] <printForever> when I type location.href.indexOf('/')
[08:36:35] <printForever> what do those number mean?
[08:36:43] <printForever> *numbers
[08:37:00] <dmsuperman> they are the indexOf the slash
[08:37:11] <dmsuperman> index meaning position, starting from 0, within the string
[08:37:23] <dmsuperman> 'abc'.indexOf('b') gives you 1
[08:37:29] <dmsuperman> .indexOf('c') gives you 2
[08:37:43] <printForever> dmsuperman, but when I type /nl I get 23
[08:37:58] <dmsuperman> debug location.href
[08:38:02] <printForever> location.href.indexOf('/nl') I get 23
[08:38:04] <dmsuperman> (it includes the domain)
[08:38:20] <dmsuperman> ok then that means the indexOf /nl is 23 (or 24 characters from the start of location.href)
[08:38:32] <printForever> ouh... ok
[08:38:39] <printForever> so my IF sucks
[08:38:52] <printForever> because my IF is if(location.href.indexOf('nl/') != -1) {
[08:39:10] <printForever> so basically I am applying everything to everything
[08:39:11] <gnarf> so that means 23 != -1
[08:39:24] <gnarf> 'abc'.indexOf('d') is -1
[08:39:29] <printForever> but I have multiple ifs with the same != -1
[08:39:53] <gnarf> -1 means "not found"
[08:39:56] <printForever> right
[08:39:58] <gnarf> for indexOf
[08:40:07] <gnarf> so you are looking for cases when it is not not found
[08:40:12] <gnarf> seems correct
[08:40:23] <printForever> you had me, and you lost me
[08:40:26] <printForever> NOT NOT FOUND?
[08:40:30] <gnarf> have you tried adding console.log('made it into this if') inside
[08:40:56] <Duce1nik> gnarf not work    document.querySelector('#customerList').innerHTML = startList + listResult+ endList;        $('#customerList').on('click','ul.customerList2 li', getCustomerDetail);
[08:41:13] <printForever>  console.log('location.href.indexOf('/')')
[08:41:14] <printForever> NaN
[08:41:22] <gnarf> Duce1nik: why the hell are you using querySelector ?
[08:41:33] <gnarf> printForever: yes
[08:41:39] <gnarf> because 'string'/'string' === NaN
[08:41:40] <printForever> it returns NaN
[08:41:51] <gnarf> get rid of the outer quotes
[08:42:00] <Duce1nik> because it work
[08:42:06] <gnarf> console.log( location.href.indexOf('/') )
[08:42:41] <gnarf> Duce1nik: but you have jQuery - just $('#customerList').html( startList + listResult + endList );
[08:42:43] <gnarf> also
[08:42:46] <gnarf> before that
[08:43:01] <printForever> console.log('location.href.indexOf('/nl')') --- SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[08:43:06] <gnarf> $('#customerList').on('click', function(e) { console.log('got a click on', e.target); });
[08:43:09] <gnarf> just to test
[08:43:14] <Duce1nik> I'm new to Jquery thank for  advice
[08:43:30] <gnarf> then you can add your selector to the "on" to test your "delegation" selector
[08:43:30] <robertmaxrees> printForever too many quotes - console.log(location.href.indexOf('/nl'))
[08:43:39] <gnarf> is ul.customerList2 the #customerList ?
[08:43:48] <printForever> I get 23
[08:44:09] <gnarf> the "delegated" selector is rooted at the element you bind on
[08:44:17] <printForever> I know what is 23, dmsuperman explained it to me
[08:44:23] <printForever> but what do I do with 23?
[08:44:35] <gnarf> 23 != -1 -- so it should be true and enter that if
[08:44:42] <printForever> also, because my IF's are all != -1 so they are ALL running on the page
[08:44:43] <gnarf> put a console log inside of the if, see if it runs
[08:44:52] <gnarf> printForever: not the ones that aren't found
[08:45:04] <gnarf> try console.log(location.href.indexOf('/notHere'))
[08:45:14] <gnarf> thats -1
[08:45:17] <printForever> -1
[08:45:26] <printForever> but if I try /de
[08:45:28] <printForever> it returns
[08:45:37] <printForever> -1
[08:45:40] <printForever> ...
[08:45:43] <printForever> dafuq?
[08:45:51] <gnarf> yeah, because /de isn't in your current url yeah?
[08:46:08] <gnarf> switch to a /de page, and it should return 23 or wherever it shows up in the url
[08:46:25] <printForever> gnarf, dmsuperman I GOT IT!
[08:46:28] <printForever> I UNDERSTOOD
[08:46:36] <printForever> now it sucks that the IF is not working :(
[08:46:44] <printForever> because I know that the statement is correct
[08:46:52] <printForever> (also, I now understand what I wrote)
[08:47:01] <printForever> (wrote/copied)
[08:47:02] <gnarf> printForever: it probably is - add a console.log('hey im here') inside the if you're testing
[08:47:10] <gnarf> like inside the {} part of the if
[08:47:17] <printForever> right
[08:47:43] <gnarf> hey trevor :)
[08:47:49] <printForever> SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
[08:48:32] <gnarf> printForever: did you put 'hey i'm here' ? :)
[08:48:39] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[08:48:40] <gnarf> note the mismatched quotes
[08:48:45] <trevor> hey gnarf :)
[08:48:47] <robertmaxrees> syntax highlighting helps a lot.
[08:48:52] <gnarf> 'hey i\'m here'
[08:48:53] <robertmaxrees> gnarf++
[08:49:05] <printForever> gnarf, no I copied the things between the {}
[08:49:09] <gnarf> or "hey i'm here"
[08:49:30] <gnarf> printForever: just add one simple console.log('test') inside the block for the if
[08:49:32] <gnarf> see if it runs
[08:49:41] <printForever> still the same thing SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
[08:49:53] <gnarf> printForever: well, now you've screwed your syntax - fix it
[08:49:54] <gnarf> :)
[08:50:17] <gnarf> printForever: try pasting your code into http://www.jshint.com/
[08:50:24] <gnarf> it will probably find it for you
[08:50:56] <Duce1nik> gnarf  ul.customerList2 is in the  #customerList
[08:51:35] <Duce1nik> gnarf your code work but.. when i click  my method still not being call
[08:52:00] <Duce1nik> $('#customerList').on('click','getCustomerDetail');
[08:52:11] <printForever> Expected ')' and instead saw 'span'.
[08:52:22] <robertmaxrees> Duce1nik $('#customerList').on('click', getCustomerDetail);
[08:52:27] <robertmaxrees> remove those last quotes.
[08:53:00] <printForever> so I ran this ....   console.log("$("span.icl-nl").addClass("icl-current");")
[08:53:08] <printForever> and I got  SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[08:53:34] <robertmaxrees> printForever too many quotes.
[08:53:45] <robertmaxrees>  console.log($("span.icl-nl").addClass("icl-current"));
[08:53:53] <printForever> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[08:53:55] <printForever> ok
[08:54:11] <printForever> sill the same SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[08:54:11] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to wrap everything in there in quotes, though that's not particularly useful when running something like addclass.
[08:54:11] <gnarf> Duce1nik: why are you putting the method name in quotes? is it a function?
[08:54:25] <gnarf> Duce1nik: $('#customerList').on('click', getCustomerDetail);
[08:54:48] <printForever> robertmaxrees should I use ' instead of ""
[08:55:18] <robertmaxrees> printForever that won't run the addclass method.
[08:55:23] <robertmaxrees> it'll just print a string to the console.
[08:55:24] <gnarf> printForever: you should stop wrapping things in quotes that unless you want to log the actual code inside the quotes (instead of the result of executing that code)
[08:55:27] <Duce1nik> gnarf it work... the method is being call
[08:55:34] <printForever> still the same
[08:56:08] <gnarf> Duce1nik: so if you add .on('click', 'li', getCustomerDetail) -- then this should be one of the li's inside the click handler
[08:56:14] <printForever> SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list -------- console.log($('span.icl-nl').addClass('icl-current');)
[08:56:26] <gnarf> printForever: semi-colon is inside of a statement there
[08:56:32] <printForever> ok
[08:56:32] <gnarf> console.log( somethingToLog )
[08:56:44] <gnarf> somethingToLog is an expression
[08:56:47] <printForever> TypeError: $ is not a function
[08:56:47] <gnarf> not a statement
[08:56:55] <printForever> removing $?
[08:57:09] <printForever> TypeError: "span.icl-nl".addClass is not a function
[08:57:13] <gnarf> printForever: try "jQuery" ?
[08:57:36] <gnarf> printForever: it's possible that jQuery is running in "noConflict" mode (where it removes the bidning to $)
[08:57:43] <ngharo> how is w3 schools _still_ ranked higher than mdn in most every good search? Ugh.
[08:58:00] <robertmaxrees> good SEO and they get linked to a lot.
[08:58:10] <gnarf> ngharo: years of google cache poisioning and a lot of links from old resources
[08:58:12] <printForever> <gnarf> printForever: try "jQuery" ?, tried it, it just prints out jQuery
[08:58:23] <robertmaxrees> printForever use jQuery instead of $
[08:58:24] <gnarf> printForever: instead of $
[08:58:26] <dmsuperman> I avoided MDN for the longest time thinking it was MSDN
[08:58:27] <gnarf> use jQuery
[08:58:29] <robertmaxrees> no quotes.
[08:58:30] <printForever> ok
[08:58:47] <printForever> IT WORKED
[08:58:56] <printForever> gnarf, I want your babies
[08:58:58] <printForever> now
[08:59:12] <gnarf> printForever: so - you're going to want to change the code a bit now that we know this
[08:59:13] <printForever> holly crap it worked...
[08:59:16] <gnarf> you still want to be able to use $
[08:59:28] <gnarf> so you can add what
[08:59:32] <gnarf> is called an IIFE
[08:59:34] <gnarf> `iife @printForever
[08:59:34] <b-ot> printForever: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[08:59:44] <gnarf> that wraps around the whole set of code
[08:59:50] <printForever> or I can replace every $ with jQuery?
[08:59:58] <gnarf> (function($) { ......oldcodehere.... }(jQuery))
[09:00:07] <robertmaxrees> ^ do this.
[09:00:08] <gnarf> ^^^ inside of that function $ === jQuery
[09:00:21] <gnarf> also stops you from accidentially making "var" at the global level
[09:00:31] <printForever> awesome!
[09:03:26] <Otineb> is the proper sytax to add “disabled” to an input element $(element).prop(‘disabled’, true); ?
[09:03:35] <robertmaxrees> yep
[09:03:38] <Otineb> ugh
[09:03:39] <Otineb> ok
[09:04:42] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: Can you look at line 11 here? http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/vszpe125/1/ It doesnt seem to add the prop back when the evaluation is false
[09:04:51] <Otineb> am I crowding that selector?
[09:05:11] <Otineb> is there a better way to add multiple properties with multiple arguments?
[09:05:32] <printForever> thank you guys! thanks a million!
[09:06:34] <robertmaxrees> Otineb your code has some syntax problems.
[09:07:02] <Otineb> oh?
[09:07:21] <Otineb> there are some methods I am using that I don’t fully understand but sounded like a good idea
[09:07:26] <Otineb> so I’m not surprised
[09:07:33] <robertmaxrees> it's not hitting the block yo thing it is.
[09:07:36] <robertmaxrees> *you think
[09:07:38] <Otineb> e.g. preventDefault()
[09:08:06] <Otineb> the prop(disabled)?
[09:08:08] <robertmaxrees> $('#confirm').on('keyup', '#delete-confirm-box', function() { is not what you want - you want click for the event
[09:08:34] <Otineb> well, that’s where the .one(‘click’,…) comes in
[09:08:47] <Otineb> im just trying to disabled/enable the delete button
[09:08:52] <Otineb> the click should be for that delete button
[09:09:11] <robertmaxrees> when are you expecting that binding to run?
[09:09:25] <Otineb> when the user clicks the delete button
[09:09:34] <robertmaxrees> keyup is a keyboard event.
[09:09:37] <robertmaxrees> not a mouse event.
[09:10:41] <robertmaxrees> mind trying to explain what exactly you're tyring to accomplish here?
[09:14:00] <Otineb> sure
[09:14:08] <Otineb> it’s a super CYA delete confirmation
[09:15:14] <robertmaxrees> so it launches the modal, and when they click the button, it disables?
[09:16:53] <robertmaxrees> aaaah you're confused.  I get it now.
[09:17:08] <robertmaxrees> you want to do .prop('disabled', false)
[09:17:13] <Otineb> sorry, someone in my office
[09:17:15] <Otineb> OH!
[09:17:18] <Otineb> perfect!
[09:17:52] <Otineb> so… $('#delete').prop('disabled', false).prop('class', 'btn');
[09:17:53] <Otineb> ?
[09:18:03] <robertmaxrees> use addClass('btn') instead of that last one
[09:18:08] <Otineb> copy
[09:18:50] <csd_> what's the cleanest way to .append() an html tag, and also set a ton of tag attrs at the same time
[09:19:10] <robertmaxrees> create the element using $() first.
[09:19:19] <robertmaxrees> $('<span/>', {});
[09:21:08] <csd_>  i don't think i've seen that usage before
[09:21:23] <csd_> how does that create a new element
[09:22:38] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery/ explained in here :)
[09:23:03] <frank_o> Is there a way to prevent Slick.js (https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/) from creating so many broken prev/next links? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Lr30ngo1/1/
[09:38:49] <bradfordli123> I was wondering if anyone could help me answer my stackoverflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26491763/storing-selected-checkboxes-into-an-array-jquery
[09:39:17] <robertmaxrees> bind toi the change event instead.
[09:40:15] <robertmaxrees> and do you really want arrays?  or jquery objects?
[09:40:58] <robertmaxrees> oh derp i can't read today.  so on click of the button, you want all checked inputs?
[09:45:46] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/82zs7x5e/
[09:46:16] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: thanks! ill take a look!
[09:56:21] <torbjorn> when capturing a keypress event, is there a way to tell if the element/focus that received it is an input field
[09:59:56] <robertmaxrees> look at the event.target
[10:01:10] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: I have code the has no error but im not sure how to test to see if it is functioning correctly. I left a comment under the stackoverflow question. Could you please explain? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26491763/storing-selected-checkboxes-into-an-array-jquery
[10:02:04] <robertmaxrees> why not use my version?
[10:03:47] <robertmaxrees> and your issue is your selectors - there's no .testpages or .configs in your sample html from before.
[10:05:30] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: my sample html was a sample for the specific question. I have other code that I was using. Sorry for the confusion
[10:05:50] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle to show what you've got and/or use my code that works ;)
[10:06:35] <csd_> dmsuperman: do you know of an easy way using X-Editable to disable editing upon submission?
[10:06:59] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: i tried change the code you provided me to the appropriate selectors but it doesnt work for me =/
[10:07:07] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 update the fiddle then.
[10:07:16] <robertmaxrees> i can't help you troubleshoot what I can't see ;)
[10:08:03] <gnarf> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/82zs7x5e/1/
[10:08:09] <gnarf> cc bradfordli123 ^^^
[10:08:24] <robertmaxrees> hah that's another way to do it.
[10:09:02] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/liondancer/82zs7x5e/2/
[10:09:36] <robertmaxrees> get that onclick off the button to start with.
[10:10:03] <robertmaxrees> and you're not using a button element, so that click event listener isn't bidning to anything.
[10:10:37] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: shoot sorry my mistake
[10:10:40] <gnarf> bradfordli123: robertmaxrees: use $('form').on('submit') instead of button clicks for submission stuffs
[10:10:50] <robertmaxrees> ^ yep
[10:10:54] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/82zs7x5e/3/
[10:10:54] <gnarf> that way it binds to enter keypress and other accessibility things
[10:11:05] <dmsuperman> csd_: not sure. does the plugin provide a "destroy" method?
[10:11:20] <dmsuperman> csd_: that plugin seems more oriented for continual edits
[10:11:22] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/82zs7x5e/4/ this uses the submit handler.
[10:11:26] <dmsuperman> you could just borrow the concepts though
[10:11:54] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 also: don't put a doctype or head or anything like that in jsfiddle.
[10:12:08] <csd_> I'm wondering what trigger I'd use.. I guess I could use .ajaxComplete()
[10:12:37] <csd_> I do see references to destroy when searching
[10:13:34] <dmsuperman> I think the plugin is also oriented toward saving one field at a time, where you might want to save the fields in a batch?
[10:13:46] <dmsuperman> but yeah, destroy the plugin after saving
[10:14:11] <csd_> oh yeah i'd want batch
[10:14:13] <dmsuperman> you could try writing your own from scratch, it's really rather simplistic :)
[10:14:35] <csd_> this isn't my domain .. rather just use whatever is available already
[10:14:37] <dmsuperman> just make a few text fields, with a save button, that triggers a $.post
[10:14:57] <dmsuperman> and replaces the row of text fields with a row of rendered values
[10:15:11] <dmsuperman> probably < 15 lines
[10:15:16] <dmsuperman> it also depends what your backend is for saving
[10:15:29] <dmsuperman> so off-the-shelf will probably still require some work by you
[10:27:04] <tinkiete> hi to all
[10:28:40] <bradfordli123> why is it that even though i set the array to [] when I click the button, the array gets longer and keeps appending? http://jsfiddle.net/kunknown/gwrermga/1/
[10:29:05] <tinkiete> i want to do , next previous http://jsfiddle.net/c502b3Lv/12/
[10:29:10] <tinkiete> havent achieve that
[10:29:24] <dmsuperman> bradfordli123: you aren't. you're setting it to [] when document.ready fires
[10:29:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:29:43] <robertmaxrees> you set it empty once, not every time you click.
[10:31:15] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: shoot i forgot to click update on jsfiddle
[10:31:18] <bradfordli123> my mistake
[10:38:53] <tinkiete>  i want to do , next previous http://jsfiddle.net/c502b3Lv/12/ the previous isnt working at all
[10:39:03] <tinkiete> dont know whats wrong
[10:41:56] <rubyonrailed> Hey jQuery, I wan't to grab multiple IDs that have different numeral values.  Say one page could have `product_1` and `product_2`, but another page just has `product_1`.  How can I dynamically find how many products I need to grab with jquery
[10:42:12] <robertmaxrees> give them a class and select that instead.
[10:42:21] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll need to do an attribute contains selector.
[10:43:03] <rindolf> rubyonrailed: hi.
[10:43:46] <rindolf> rubyonrailed: you can grab all items with id-s and filter them but robert's suggestion is better.
[10:43:54] <rindolf> tinkiete: hi, let me see.
[10:44:00] <rubyonrailed> As in they all share the same class?  I need them all to be individual
[10:44:14] <rubyonrailed> Nvm
[10:44:25] <rubyonrailed> I see, give them a class as well as their id
[10:44:43] <rindolf> rubyonrailed: yes.
[10:45:19] <rubyonrailed> seems like such an obvious answer :p
[10:45:35] <bradfordli123> This is probably a really beginner question but how come i can't call 'k' in my developer tools? I want to see if the array is saved to I can use it somewhere else later  http://jsfiddle.net/liondancer/gwrermga/9/
[10:45:35] <rindolf> tinkiete: why are you calling a variable name with $  -that's unnecessary.
[10:45:43] <rubyonrailed> I just start jQuerying and get scared
[10:46:18] <rindolf> tinkiete: and are you sure thhe variables stay the same at each callback?
[10:47:16] <tinkiete> rindolf: the next is working, but not the previous
[10:47:43] <tinkiete> rindolf: no, it doesnt
[10:47:47] <tinkiete> i dont get why
[10:48:26] <Otineb> tinkiete: your selector looks off
[10:48:37] <Otineb> in one function you have all buttons called
[10:48:42] <Otineb> in the other you have the second one
[10:49:04] <rindolf> tinkiete: shouldn't you distinguish between the left and right button using an id="..." or something?
[10:49:20] <frank_o> How do I pass `$(this).find('.option')` and `$(this).find('.prev_next')` to Slick.js? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Lr30ngo1/4/ produces: `Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object Object]:not(.slick-cloned) in jquery-2.1.0.js:1429`
[10:49:24] <frank_o> Without something like this, Slick.js would freak out and produce a whole bunch of broken prev/next links: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Lr30ngo1/3/
[10:49:47] <Fraz> hi
[10:50:34] <Fraz> when you do $('#somelist li').each(); are the li elements looped in order?
[10:50:36] <tinkiete> yeah
[10:50:38] <Fraz> always?
[10:50:43] <tinkiete> rindolf: let me do it now
[10:51:28] <Otineb> tinkiete: what are you trying to do?
[10:52:05] <tinkiete> rindolf: Otineb http://jsfiddle.net/c502b3Lv/13/
[10:52:26] <tinkiete> Otineb: a next and previous, of a li
[10:52:59] <Otineb> tinkiete: so the output should always ONLY display the current element?
[10:54:08] <tinkiete> Otineb: yeah , but if we click on the previous , we go back and if we click next we go to next , like a carrousel
[11:04:22] <saba> I'm catching 'mouseup mousedown mousemove click' on document and with a fast click and drag with one external mouse I see mousedown -> mouseup -> mousemove -> mousedown -> mousemove in Chrome.
[11:04:46] <saba> Has anyone noticed mousemove being called after mouseup?
[11:06:41] <BillCriswell> saba: Not clicking steady enough.
[11:07:16] <rindolf> tinkiete: maybe keep an index in a variable as  state instead of messing with the DOM.
[11:07:56] <tinkiete> i have tried that but it didnt  change any thing
[11:08:10] <saba> BillCriswell: so it is a question of mouse sensitivity? I have to think about stabilizing it then
[11:08:47] <BillCriswell> saba: That's just my assumption to be honest. Do you have your mouse speed way up?
[11:09:16] <BillCriswell> saba: You can set a flag like ignoreMouseMove after a mouse up for like... 200ms.
[11:09:40] <saba> BillCriswell: I guess so, yes
[11:09:45] <saba> BillCriswell: that's a good idea!
[11:09:59] <BillCriswell> saba: Awww yeah.
[11:24:28] <torbjorn> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[11:25:00] <checkit> Not sure why I'm having some much troble with this extension today. Can anyone help me understand why two consoles logs are being sent to the console? http://jsfiddle.net/7h8pxhcm/
[11:26:20] <robertmaxrees> checkit because $(options.selectors.location).on('change', $.fn.updateLocation(options)); is evaluating the function when you run the binding.
[11:26:33] <tirengarfio> I want to alert the values of data-something here: http://jsfiddle.net/5f6tfufg/2/ but I get "element.data is not a function"
[11:26:35] <robertmaxrees> you want $(options.selectors.location).on('change', $.fn.updateLocation);
[11:26:54] <robertmaxrees> tirengarfio because element is a raw dom node - try $(element)
[11:27:12] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Thank you! How will I be able to pass it options?
[11:27:44] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/ - check out the stuff about the optional data object.
[11:28:02] <robertmaxrees> you can't pass args like you normally would, but you can pass data, which you can treat similarly.
[11:29:01] <tirengarfio> robertmaxrees, thanks, but Im getting undefined, I expected 1, 2 an 3
[11:29:34] <robertmaxrees> tirengarfio because you want .data('something')
[11:29:41] <robertmaxrees> not .data('jander')
[11:30:04] <tirengarfio> thanks!
[11:46:29] <checkit> Okay so how can I access options from within my updateLocation method? http://jsfiddle.net/7h8pxhcm/1/
[11:47:28] <robertmaxrees> you can't.  options is currently scoped to a different function.
[11:47:38] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to put them in the same scope
[11:52:06] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Any direction for me on how to go about doing that? This "extension" is a way trimmed down version of the one I'm actually working with. Otherwise it wouldn't look  so over engineered.
[11:53:12] <robertmaxrees> learn about functions and scope, or place all of your logic within that document ready.
[11:53:35] <robertmaxrees> vars created in functions exist only within that functions and child functions.
[11:53:39] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't exist outside.
[11:55:20] <doug64k> does this scroll (very) smoothly on your machine anybody: http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/2/
[11:56:34] <dmsuperman> back again I see!
[11:56:42] <dmsuperman> It's really only the trackpad that makes it run like crap
[11:56:45] <dmsuperman> I had a thought though
[11:56:57] <doug64k> dmsuperman: ok thanks :D
[11:57:01] <dmsuperman> what if you buffer the rendered rows
[11:57:20] <checkit> doug64k: Scrolling kind of rough on mine...
[11:57:21] <dmsuperman> like instead of only rendering the 17 visible, render an extra 17 above and below
[11:57:41] <doug64k> ok, if it scrolls rough, is this just as bad: http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/2/show
[11:58:13] <dmsuperman> actually that's worse for me
[11:58:17] <dmsuperman> maybe just because it's more rows
[11:59:05] <dmsuperman> if I use the physical scrollbar in the first link, it's relatively smooth. trackpad is poor. but even physical scrollbar in the second link is laggy
[11:59:38] <NoiseEee> http://jankfree.org/ @ dmsuperman
[12:00:17] <dmsuperman> @ me?
[12:00:48] <NoiseEee> sorry, whoever is seeking to cut out lag on scrolling etc
[12:01:09] <dmsuperman> ah, you might want to look at his code
[12:01:15] <dmsuperman> it's kind of neat actually
[12:01:24] <dmsuperman> giant mega-table that scrolls pretty fast
[12:01:36] <dmsuperman> by destroying the rows off screen
[12:02:47] <BillCriswell> Might be talking about htis: http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/
[12:04:18] <doug64k> how many ms per update comes up in the console http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/3/  (if you don't mind checking :)
[12:05:16] <dmsuperman> doug64k: between 1-6ms normally.. and when it lags occasionally it bumps up to around 20ms
[12:05:30] <doug64k> wow.. that's probably GC
[12:05:43] <doug64k> when I profiled it gc was taking ~ 20 ms
[12:06:11] <doug64k> to maintain 60 fps (buttery smooth) each update must be < 16ms
[12:06:26] <dmsuperman> ooh, maybe an object pool will help fix that?
[12:06:40] <dmsuperman> defeat the GC fighting the code
[12:06:49] <doug64k> dmsuperman: yeah. instead of removing, I could modify the old rows
[12:07:41] <dmsuperman> oh that too. I was thinking the activeRows could be pooled as well maybe, not sure
[12:08:03] <dmsuperman> is this just a boredom project btw?
[12:08:05] <doug64k> dmsuperman: yes, it would be the pool if my thought works
[12:08:43] <dmsuperman> well ok, I'm thinking 2 pools now. the activeRows pool, as well as somehow pooling the DOM nodes themselves?
[12:08:59] <dmsuperman> that might not save anything since it still has to repaint
[12:09:05] <doug64k> dmsuperman: not really, this is a prototype for the next site that needs a massive scrolling area. I want to be prepared when doing real work
[12:09:17] <dmsuperman> but deleting and creating nodes is probably slower than repurposing nodes
[12:09:57] <robertmaxrees> dunno what y'all are talking about,  but sounds like you need fragments.
[12:10:13] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/3/
[12:10:26] <robertmaxrees> cliff's notes?
[12:10:40] <dmsuperman> million row table that deletes off-screen rows so scrolling is fast
[12:11:32] <dmsuperman> that infinity lib performs pretty well too doug64k, maybe worth reading that source?
[12:11:37] <dmsuperman> could learn some tips
[12:13:08] <dmsuperman> actually it performs on my machine better than your table does...and it's got images and stuff
[12:13:39] <doug64k> does it miss the font cache like crazy? maybe the ridiculous number of glyphs is overflowing the font cache
[12:13:56] <doug64k> sec
[12:14:08] <dmsuperman> would that print a console error? I think I've seen that in my console before but I don't see it for your demo
[12:14:55] <doug64k> dmsuperman: no, it would just take more ms to draw that character
[12:15:01] <doug64k> is this any better http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/4/
[12:15:35] <dmsuperman> I think I stole your fiddle
[12:15:47] <dmsuperman> version 6 I just repeated the letter A for every row and it performs much better
[12:16:01] <dmsuperman> and yeah this one as well
[12:16:08] <doug64k> so the font cache makes the test case hard
[12:16:10] <dmsuperman> so maybe the crazy characters play a part
[12:16:37] <doug64k> I suppose I can live with most updates < 10ms
[12:16:46] <dmsuperman> actually it performs wonderfully
[12:16:50] <doug64k> want to see the old 100x worse implementation of this I made?
[12:17:00] <dmsuperman> the highest I see now is 4ms
[12:17:05] <dmsuperman> most of them are 1 or 2
[12:17:11] <doug64k> nice
[12:17:39] <dmsuperman> yeah let's see it and make fun of it
[12:18:17] <doug64k> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/
[12:19:20] <doug64k> hangs for hundreds of ms while populating :D
[12:19:42] <dmsuperman> ooof yeah
[12:19:44] <dmsuperman> wow
[12:19:51] <dmsuperman> once it populates though the scroll is pretty good :P
[12:20:08] <dmsuperman> it just too like 5 seconds to start scrolling
[12:21:55] <doug64k> haha, you should see the one that is really a table. you basically have to kill the browser process :D
[12:22:40] <decx> cache win.height() unless it's resize
[12:22:45] <decx> few ns
[12:23:08] <dmsuperman> haha
[12:23:10] <doug64k> every cell, it reflows the whole table, because, maybe that cell made the column wider
[12:23:35] <decx> of course document.createDocumentFragment() and appendchild instead of all the jquery wrappers would be the most efficient
[12:23:53] <doug64k> decx: that is what it does though essentially
[12:24:04] <doug64k> but you mean bypass the jquery overhead?
[12:24:19] <decx> document.createFragment is 3 times faster than $('<>')
[12:24:25] <doug64k> it makes a fragment per row: row = $( ... the html of the row ...)
[12:24:37] <doug64k> yeah?
[12:25:10] <doug64k> it does spend slightly over half its cpu in making new rows (when you profile holdng pagedown for 20 seconds)
[12:25:13] <decx> it's createElement but same principle http://jsperf.com/document-createelement-vs-jquery-create/6
[12:25:36] <doug64k> half the cpu that isnt ide I mean - not 50% cpu
[12:25:36] <dmsuperman> jsperf is so neat
[12:25:37] <decx> nearly 4 times faster than $('<>') here
[12:25:53] <doug64k> idle*
[12:26:45] <decx> for a table with that many cells it'll be worth it for slower devices i guess
[12:28:21] <doug64k> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/ is my old crappy implementation btw decx. this one is my new way faster one http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/3/
[12:30:14] <doug64k> decx: I'll try changing it to manually creating the dom nodes
[12:30:24] <doug64k> decx: is cloneNode better than making a new one?
[12:30:54] <decx> perf it ^^
[12:31:01] <dmsuperman> I would like to see the impact that pooling the nodes has personally
[12:31:12] <dmsuperman> repurposing the old ones instead of destroying them
[12:32:30] <decx> that virtualDiv isnt virtual anymore after you append it, so append() inside a for loop isnt that great
[12:33:21] <doug64k> decx: good point
[12:33:58] <MariusIT> hello
[12:34:00] <doug64k> decx: it doesn't append the whole screen everytime though - just the ones newly exposed (just in case you thought otherwise)
[12:34:13] <dmsuperman> still, better to batch the DOM changes where you can
[12:34:15] <doug64k> but your point still applies
[12:34:24] <MariusIT> what is the best method to satifty the dependencyes in this structure http://pastebin.com/g87Sdvnm ?
[12:35:05] <doug64k> dmsuperman: yeah, caching them might be very fast if I store something per row that lets me access the cells as efficiently as possible
[12:35:17] <MariusIT> ups, typos, update there http://pastebin.com/76BAdeYF
[12:35:18] <dmsuperman> so actually you may want to revisit the debounce
[12:35:32] <BillCriswell> MariusIT: Thnk you might be in the wrong channel .
[12:35:38] <MariusIT> ah crap
[12:35:40] <MariusIT> jquery :))
[12:35:41] <MariusIT> sry
[12:35:45] <dmsuperman> kind of like how you batched the deletes
[12:47:31] <doug64k> how long has jsfiddle /show been ruined
[12:47:55] <doug64k> you can't test history or anchor code
[12:49:25] <doug64k> jsfiddle guy: if you're out there - the whole point of /show is NOT having my page in a frame
[12:49:51] <decx> yeah that new behaviour sucks
[12:50:30] <robertmaxrees> wonder if it has anything to do with people trying to abuse the service.  i know facebook gives you a big ol' warning if you try to link to a fiddle.
[12:50:48] <decx> http://fiddle.jshell.net/ user / id /show/light/ will do
[12:50:59] <doug64k> I made a mostly finished clone of jsfiddle: http://jstraight.com
[12:51:13] <doug64k> it has /show that works right
[12:52:10] <decx> i'll play around with it
[12:52:20] <decx> aaw no tabcomplete
[12:52:56] <doug64k> decx: almost :)  I think it loads the plugin but no initialization yet
[12:53:29] <decx> ah tabcontrol.js
[12:53:51] <decx> no that doesnt look like it ^^
[12:54:41] <doug64k> I made that tab control thing
[12:54:49] <doug64k> the editor is codemirror
[12:55:07] <doug64k> try layout tabbed
[12:56:52] <doug64k> the resources thing is way better for what Iuse than jsfiddle. jsfiddle makes it a (slight) PITA to find a jquery with jqui, etc
[12:57:39] <bradfordli123> can someone take a look at this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26495197/testing-jquery-js-output-on-chrome-developer-tools
[12:58:01] <decx> i'm too familiar with it to have an unbiased ux impression
[12:58:10] <decx> doug64k ^
[12:58:26] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 those variables aren't globally defined so you can't access them in the console.
[12:58:40] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to use a step debugger or declare them outside of those functions.
[12:58:55] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: so I should set them outside the click()?
[12:59:09] <BillCriswell> bradfordli123: Also, you can something more useful for your backend by using $('form').serializeArray()
[12:59:10] <robertmaxrees> why is console.log() not working for you?
[12:59:25] <robertmaxrees> and don't use var testJson = new Object();
[12:59:29] <robertmaxrees> just to testJson = {};
[12:59:45] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: it works i can see the output but it's jsut when I want to call the variables i get undefined
[12:59:48] <doug64k> bradfordli123: returning the json to the button event caller is nonsense
[13:00:01] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 right because the variables don't exist outside of that function.
[13:00:13] <robertmaxrees> you should probably do a tutorial or three to get up to speed.
[13:00:18] <bradfordli123> BillCriswell: I'll look up what serializeArray)_ means thank you
[13:00:43] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: can you suggest some please?
[13:00:56] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ is one.
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> complete with http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/
[13:01:26] <doug64k> bradfordli123: that one robertmaxrees suggested is very good
[13:01:30] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: thank you!
[13:01:38] <robertmaxrees> mdn is a fantastic resource for all things JS.
[13:01:51] <robertmaxrees> i've heard good tings about codecademy
[13:02:19] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: i have a coding background but its jsut JS and jQuery really frsutrate me
[13:02:36] <robertmaxrees> they're not that bad.
[13:02:39] <doug64k> bradfordli123: it wont take long then
[13:02:49] <doug64k> jq is EASY :D
[13:02:50] <__joshua__> once you learn js's strengths and what to avoid you will be alright
[13:02:54] <robertmaxrees> you'll figure stuff out pretty quick - just keep in mind JS is NOT a class-based language, so don't treat it like one.
[13:03:42] <doug64k> compared to most apis jq is a breeze
[13:04:00] <mdev> .each(function(){ how can i determine if it failed
[13:04:10] <robertmaxrees> mdev not sure waht you mean "failed".
[13:04:12] <mdev> didn't find what it was searching for so I can call another function
[13:04:22] <robertmaxrees> mdev check the length of your selector first.
[13:04:32] <BillCriswell> The "search" should already be done at that point.
[13:04:34] <doug64k> mdev: determine if there are any? .length
[13:04:37] <mdev> callbacks such annoying pain because cna't just call function afterwards as it calls it anyway
[13:04:50] <mdev> huh?
[13:04:52] <robertmaxrees> mdev you have to check the .length of the selector beforehand and go from there.
[13:04:57] <trewd6> $('#divStart").effect("highlight", "slow");      how can I highlight that div x number of times?
[13:05:01] <robertmaxrees> you can't do it from within the .each()
[13:05:12] <doug64k> mdev: you can return false to abort $.each
[13:05:26] <BillCriswell> mdev: You don't even need to make sure anything exists before you run each, you can run each on a empty collection and be ok.
[13:05:27] <mdev> ugh
[13:05:27] <robertmaxrees> he's not trying to abort the each - he wants to know if it ran at all.
[13:05:38] <mdev> Bill sure I can
[13:05:57] <mdev> i'm sure a table elements for specific text
[13:06:11] <mdev> if doesn't exist in a row, after searching all rows I wanna do something else
[13:06:30] <BillCriswell> mdev: Icky.
[13:06:45] <mdev> not really callbacks just dumb in lot of situations, like this one
[13:06:48] <mdev> makes logic very hard
[13:06:59] <BillCriswell> mdev: You can just do $('table').text().indexOf('string') > -1;
[13:07:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?  sounds like you have a larger design problem imo.
[13:10:32] <mdev> robertmaxress yeah blame me
[13:10:34] <mdev> nice
[13:10:48] <doug64k> mdev: $('table tr').contents().filter(function() { return $(this).text().indexOf(searchFor) >= 0; }).length > 0    maybe
[13:10:56] <robertmaxrees> not blaming you buddy
[13:11:00] <BillCriswell> lol
[13:11:13] <BillCriswell> doug64k: Didn't like my approach? =(
[13:11:45] <doug64k> BillCriswell: yours is fine but it might get confused by some html tag that matches right?
[13:12:01] <BillCriswell> doug64k: .text() shouldn't return html tags.
[13:12:02] <doug64k> ah nevermind, you .text it
[13:12:26] <doug64k> sorry didn't notice - yours is practically the same idea just does it all in one hit
[13:12:45] <mdev> thanks doug64k
[13:12:45] <doug64k> I must have noticed it subconsciously
[13:13:01] <BillCriswell> I thought it was pretty clever, but that usually mean there's some horrible side-effect lurking around.
[13:13:51] <BillCriswell> The word "cushion" always looks funny to me.
[13:17:23] <doug64k> speaking of funny words, last night when I was going to sleep I kept thinking of words that everybody says incorrectly. like comfortable (comfterble) cupboard (cubbard), environment (enviermint), etc
[13:17:41] <mdev> the text one worked, awesome ty guys
[13:17:46] <bradfordli123> I am curious as to if all the the JS/jQ code is required to be within $(document).ready(function() {}). I read somewhere that code should be within that function so that the code is loaded before the rest of the page.
[13:17:48] <robertmaxrees> doug64k depends on where you live./
[13:17:54] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: yeah
[13:18:52] <doug64k> oh and how could I forget george bush II: nukeyouler
[13:20:04] <doug64k> I never felt safe with a guy that can't *say* nuclear having any say about whether to kill people
[13:20:24] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 any code that relies on the document being loaded should be there.
[13:21:23] <robertmaxrees> think selectors and stuff.  http://api.jquery.com/ready/ covers it.
[13:21:26] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[13:24:01] <trewd6> $('#divStart").effect("highlight", "slow");      how can I highlight that div x number of times?
[13:32:56] <bradfordli123> how come when I call want to display k in chrome developer tools i get that k is undefined? http://dpaste.com/2HQVKB8
[13:33:11] <bradfordli123> sorry types*
[13:33:12] <doug64k> optimized it more http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/7/
[13:33:30] <bradfordli123> When I type in "k" in my developer tools i get that k is undefined
[13:34:31] <trewd6> $('#divStart").effect("highlight", "slow");
[13:34:33] <trewd6> how can I highlight that div x number of times?
[13:35:18] <doug64k> trewd6: it probably allows for a callback that is called when the animation is done - or perhaps it returns a deferred. that is a plugin, you'd have to say which plugin it is or read the plugin docs
[13:36:54] <doug64k> bradfordli123: return it to whom? who do you think called that? the browser is not interested in what that callback returns
[13:39:00] <bradfordli123> doug64k: I wanted to save to a variable called k so I can enter it in developer tools to see if the values are correct
[13:39:52] <doug64k> bradfordli123: http://dpaste.com/2PAF11H
[13:40:00] <doug64k> window.k = something
[13:40:14] <doug64k> it's a hack though - remember to not leave it like that
[13:40:58] <doug64k> k is assigned a jquery object that refers to the button
[13:42:08] <doug64k> bradfordli123: but for that, use console.log (as someone said a while back)
[13:42:46] <bradfordli123> doug64k: so in order for me to be able to call k or any other variable in the developer tools, I have to be in the window scope? or global scope?
[13:43:00] <bradfordli123> doug64k: however that is not good practice?
[13:43:14] <doug64k> not necessarily, if the debugger is froze somewhere by a breakpoint, that scope is active in the console
[13:43:16] <bradfordli123> doug64k: other wise console.log is the best practices?
[13:44:16] <doug64k> if I *really* want to dig deep in code like yours, I put "debugger;" there (no quotes) and it will break into the debugger right there
[13:44:52] <doug64k> remember to run run run until it isnt froze before you reload or anything
[13:45:06] <doug64k> if possible
[13:45:49] <bradfordli123> I'm confused on how to debug or check my values without using console.log =/
[13:46:03] <doug64k> debugger statement
[13:46:26] <doug64k> you have opened the debugger before right? which browser?
[13:46:49] <bradfordli123> chrome
[13:47:17] <__joshua__> press f12
[13:47:22] <doug64k> press F12 and go to Sources pane... then on the left find and click your source file, now on the right, click the line number in the gutter to ask the browser to freeze there so you can look
[13:47:41] <bradfordli123> doug64k: All i do is use the console for developer tools. Is there somewhere else I can debug step by step?
[13:47:44] <doug64k> then make the code run there and the debuggr will stop
[13:47:50] <doug64k> sources pane
[13:48:44] <doug64k> bradfordli123: see at the top it says Elements Network Sources...
[13:48:47] <doug64k> click Sources
[13:49:02] <bradfordli123> doug64k: omg this is amazing
[13:49:08] <varchar> -> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging
[13:49:15] <doug64k> damn right it is. chrome debugger is awesome
[13:49:26] <varchar> Yes it is.
[13:53:35] <__joshua__> Yeah, i have no idea how we did js before these awesome debug tools
[13:53:57] <__joshua__> also, chrome newish async stack trace is great (although used friggen heaps of memory)
[13:55:31] <doug64k> bradfordli123: you'll still find console.log useful. if you find that some code almost always works right, you might need to use console.log to pin down what's going on - it will take too long to look at every break
[13:55:50] <bradfordli123> doug64k: noted thanks!!
[13:56:08] <dave_0> hello there
[13:56:15] <MantasK> hi
[13:59:22] <dave_0> need a little help here http://www.imagefix.co.uk/hypo_demo/vehicle-graphics/  when accordion item is clicked the tab content open up currently it overlay (show over) a part of below, i want it push down the whole currently only h3("Our vehicle graphics range from the bright ") of below div push down
[14:04:58] <doug64k> saving the cpu profile in chrome creates an empty file :(
[14:06:46] <doug64k> anyway, now the highest cpu consuming thing is elemData.handle http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/7/
[14:06:52] <doug64k> whatever that is :D
[14:07:40] <__joshua__> scrolling hurts ;p
[14:09:59] <doug64k> only 2% of cpu time is in my code... I wish it elaborated on what (program) time was
[14:13:38] <mdev> rows[0].ID how can i check if that's set or not
[14:13:50] <mdev> simple if(rows[0].ID) gives error
[14:14:31] <doug64k> mdev: then rows must not be an array
[14:14:46] <doug64k>  / must not be an object with a property named '0'
[14:15:27] <doug64k> mdev: if (rows !== undefined && rows[0].id)   <-- that will always work
[14:15:33] <doug64k> ID*
[14:16:06] <doug64k> but rows not being an array might be a bug, so don't blindly do that
[14:16:25] <__joshua__> doug64k:  check the timeline
[14:16:41] <mdev> thanls
[14:17:11] <__joshua__> doug64k:  also rate limit your scroll callback
[14:17:23] <doug64k> __joshua__: why
[14:17:29] <doug64k> it's 1 to 4 ms
[14:17:42] <doug64k> I want it peppier, not slower :D
[14:17:51] <doug64k> I used to have debounce and it ruined the responsiveness
[14:18:00] <sorry_for_last_p> hello guys need a little help
[14:18:22] <__joshua__> it is spending all its time on layout (check chrome timeline)
[14:18:46] <doug64k> __joshua__: how? everything is absolutely positioned except the one div that doesn't move. perhaps the appends?
[14:19:52] <doug64k> __joshua__: any ideas on how to reduce layout time?
[14:20:17] <doug64k> maybe that one relative div causes a cascade and causes a full reflow
[14:20:31] <doug64k> it's only about 10 divs though
[14:20:36] <doug64k> 1 div per row + 1
[14:21:34] <dmsuperman> have you tried pooling the dom nodes yet?
[14:21:42] <dmsuperman> I still maintain that will prob help
[14:21:45] <__joshua__> can't you achieve this without absolute and relative positions?  using margins for isntance?
[14:22:04] <mdev> TypeError: Cannot read property 'ID' of undefined
[14:22:07] <mdev> even with your check
[14:22:13] <mdev> really dumb it's doing this
[14:22:55] <doug64k> dmsuperman: yes I will try it. I broke it down into functions to improve the profiler, to be more sure of where cpu is going
[14:23:04] <dmsuperman> cool
[14:23:33] <dmsuperman> either pooling the nodes, or batching the DOM changes with a debounce
[14:23:39] <dmsuperman> even if it's as simple as a 25ms debounce
[14:23:55] <mdev> rows is []
[14:24:02] <mdev> when I strinfy and console.log it
[14:24:02] <dmsuperman> (not debouncing the update trigger, just debouncing the DOM updates)
[14:24:12] <mdev> so how I check that for
[14:24:14] <dmsuperman> mdev: so that's why rows[0].ID is undefined :P
[14:24:19] <dmsuperman> check rows.length
[14:24:21] <dmsuperman> > 0
[14:24:25] <mdev> thanks
[14:24:28] <__joshua__> wont help.  its all layout reflows, cause by the position styles
[14:24:54] <dmsuperman> __joshua__: right, my point is he's making several reflows happen per scroll, instead of batching it into one reflow every 25ms at a minimum
[14:25:01] <dmsuperman> right now it could be firing several reflows in the same ms
[14:25:11] <__joshua__> well yeah, its the first thing i said too (to rate limit)
[14:25:24] <dmsuperman> rate limit just the DOM changes though, not the rest of the code
[14:25:29] <dmsuperman> which is what he was doing initially
[14:25:30] <dmsuperman> (last night)
[14:25:46] <dmsuperman> that might get tricky though. I suspect pooling the DOM nodes will be easier
[14:25:49] <dmsuperman> and have a similar effect
[14:26:07] <sorry_for_last_p> dmsuperman hey superman :) need a little help? :) on this site http://www.imagefix.co.uk/hypo_demo/vehicle-graphics/  accordion on right overlay the below div when clicked, i just want that to push the whole div how do i do it?
[14:26:12] <__joshua__> I suspect removing the relative positioning.
[14:26:24] <dmsuperman> well that's how he gets the scrollbar to keep working
[14:26:40] <__joshua__> is it really the only way?
[14:26:42] <dmsuperman> I don't think the margin approach is right since he would have to keep track of which row is at the top o the page
[14:26:50] <dmsuperman> and only give that row a margin
[14:26:58] <dmsuperman> vs the positioning which is a simple math calculation
[14:27:46] <dmsuperman> yeah by positioning it an arbitrary position down the page that's how he gets the big empty gaps on top and bottom so the scrollbar shows up
[14:30:17] <__joshua__> 1 million items http://jsdo.it/zz85/75cq
[14:30:40] <__joshua__> but fake scrollbar
[14:31:18] <dmsuperman> screw that
[14:31:33] <dmsuperman> it scrolls me down the page too if I scroll too fast
[14:31:38] <dmsuperman> never mess with the scrollbar
[14:31:47] <__joshua__> agreed
[14:32:12] <dmsuperman> BillCriswell linked an infinity.js lib earlier that I suspect contains many great secrets
[14:32:19] <dmsuperman> it performs buttery smooth and even has images and stuff
[14:33:14] <dmsuperman> I suspect that will be another concern for you as well doug64k. your code works well now when there's basically 0 rendering time to come up with the rows because you're just printing random letters
[14:33:24] <dmsuperman> but once you use real data you're going to be re-calculating whole templates
[14:34:57] <__joshua__> throttle works fine
[14:34:58] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/9/
[14:35:11] <__joshua__> doug64k
[14:36:38] <doug64k> __joshua__: that causes slight flicker, but that's pretty unavoidable
[14:37:13] <doug64k> well, not unavoidable if I create more rows than are displayed
[14:37:35] <doug64k> perhaps keep a whole screenful above and below the real display area
[14:37:46] <__joshua__> you could also make the scrollbar not actually contain the rows.  but that creates other problems
[14:38:09] <__joshua__> doug64k: you should do a hundred or so flanking rows
[14:38:11] <doug64k> __joshua__: the one "virtualDiv" div makes the page big. maybe I don't follow
[14:39:06] <__joshua__> disregard the second scroll div idea. you would need two scroll handlers AND it would work like shit on browsers that emit scroll events slowly
[14:40:49] <dmsuperman> I agree with the flanking rows
[14:40:54] <dmsuperman> I think I suggested that earlier today ;)
[14:40:59] <doug64k> yeah
[14:41:16] <doug64k> I'm considering all suggestions, no hand waving here
[14:41:34] <dmsuperman> ah yeah wasn't pointing fingers I guess just saying it's on the list already
[14:42:19] <__joshua__> 130.869 ms Loading 229.314 ms Scripting 121.034 ms Rendering 162.689 ms Painting 68.155 ms Other
[14:42:39] <__joshua__> no more low hanging fruit
[14:42:48] <doug64k> I think __joshua__ indirectly answered my question about (program) time. the timeline tells you
[14:53:46] <doug64k> http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/10/  (adds 2 screenfulls of offscreen rows)
[14:54:08] <dmsuperman> performance still good, visual display is nicer
[15:01:35] <doug64k> the debounce still causes lagginess though
[15:01:43] <decx> i'd still say use createElement
[15:02:05] <doug64k> I was thinking though - perhaps it is far more expensive to make changes that are onscreen - maybe removing debounce and having the extra rows will be faster
[15:02:05] <__joshua__> create once then clone
[15:02:31] <doug64k> this would make all changes be offscreen
[15:02:40] <doug64k> except first draw of course
[15:03:06] <doug64k> __joshua__: creating rows is < 1.0% cpu time
[15:03:25] <__joshua__> oh yeah
[15:03:48] <dmsuperman> where is the CPU time spent?
[15:03:52] <decx> http://jsperf.com/document-createelement-vs-jquery-create/3
[15:04:27] <dmsuperman> yeah there are a lot of performance issues you could be owrking on. I would say fix those issues and then revisit whether debounce truly makes a poor experience
[15:04:55] <dmsuperman> or just decrease the debounce delay
[15:05:21] <dmsuperman> even 25ms would probably be plenty, just enough so when you scroll really hard you aren't driving it berserk
[15:05:30] <__joshua__> biggest time is 'loading' atm
[15:05:31] <rubyonrailed> Is it possible to change the name of my variable?
[15:05:42] <dmsuperman> initial page load __joshua__?
[15:05:43] <rubyonrailed> with jquery
[15:05:46] <decx> it's a bit more code but there's now only one append to dom http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/11/
[15:06:01] <dmsuperman> rubyonrailed: has nothing to do with jquery. you can copy the value into another variable then delete the original
[15:06:32] <dmsuperman> decx: there we go! nice
[15:06:39] <dmsuperman> performance seems good
[15:06:59] <dmsuperman> almost 0 white blank spots at the bottom with that
[15:07:05] <decx> appendChild in a createElement is cheapo
[15:07:07] <dmsuperman> and the console reports no more than 2ms
[15:07:28] <dmsuperman> occasional 3 or 4ms if I really scroll it hard
[15:07:28] <decx> and when the rows fragment is done it's appended as usual
[15:07:36] <__joshua__> dmsuperman: no, the chrome timeline loading event (typically network stuff, but not here)
[15:08:06] <dmsuperman> decx: what do you think about my idea of pooling the nodes/fragments?
[15:08:07] <doug64k> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=78752
[15:08:13] <dmsuperman> repurposing old ones instead of deleting/recreating
[15:08:18] <dmsuperman> do you think that would be slower?
[15:08:27] <dmsuperman> I guess it would have to keep track of them then...
[15:08:35] <decx> you end up changing style anyway
[15:08:44] <decx> probably not that much difference
[15:08:49] <__joshua__> i don't think it would help much
[15:09:01] <dmsuperman> yeah thinking now that's probably not that great a gain if any
[15:09:10] <dmsuperman> I like the dom change batching though
[15:10:13] <decx> it's nice that jquery append() just accepts createDocumentFragment() like this
[15:10:41] <dmsuperman> alright trackpad scrolling gives me the 0-1ms in console output...but when I grab the physical scrollbar the ms shoots through the roof
[15:10:47] <dmsuperman> 20-40ms
[15:11:01] <dmsuperman> not sure if the console numbers are that useful but...
[15:11:03] <decx> that's your debaunce
[15:11:05] <decx> bounce
[15:11:25] <dmsuperman> why wouldn't it have an impact on trackpad scrolling though?
[15:11:37] <decx> magic
[15:11:42] <decx> no idea ^^
[15:11:44] <dmsuperman> visual performance seems good...but because they're all the same letter it may be hard to tell
[15:12:30] <dmsuperman> I'd like to see the letters get replaced with rendering a more realistic template maybe unless there's more optimizations to be had at this stage
[15:12:40] <dmsuperman> My guess is that will be where we see serious lag
[15:12:52] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/12/
[15:13:04] <dmsuperman> I'm thinking like images and such
[15:13:17] <dmsuperman> maybe some font formatting
[15:13:29] <decx> oops that's jsut one row
[15:13:32] <dmsuperman> and slight randomization
[15:13:32] <decx> ha
[15:14:46] <doug64k> updated profile from http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/8/ -> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=78753
[15:14:51] <dmsuperman> because if you go through all this with the building/destruction and it turns out rendering real world rows makes it not feasible it would be a waste. you'd have to go back and rework the whole thing to not destroy all the rows
[15:15:10] <__joshua__> doug64k: the most expensive thing for me now is html parsing, so maybe cloning would help
[15:15:11] <doug64k> holding pagedown until 0x17630
[15:16:17] <doug64k> yeah
[15:16:43] <dmsuperman> nevermind I guess my concern is overblown, this demo destroys and recreates rows as well and works just fine
[15:16:46] <dmsuperman> http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/demo-on.html
[15:18:05] <doug64k> dmsuperman: I could cache references to the spans within the row, and just iterate and set text, and repurpose old rows
[15:18:33] <doug64k> have a freelist that I push and pop instead of leaking to the gc
[15:19:07] <dmsuperman> I think they're right, I changed my mind. I don't think pooling the nodes will be much gain
[15:19:16] <doug64k> so, to make a row, peek at freelist and reuse row, else make new. all remove cases push old row to freelist
[15:19:26] <dmsuperman> I was just concerned that you get this tightly wound loop that gets thrown out of wack by having to render this big fancy HTML
[15:19:49] <doug64k> dmsuperman: if content is slow it's slow. just making sure fast content is super fast
[15:20:42] <doug64k> trying freelist idea now
[15:47:45] <Baako> hi guys i dont know why this http://pastebin.com/wk9jRF52 isnt getting alert
[15:47:45] <Baako> what have i done wrong?
[15:47:45] <Baako> alert($('#delete_profile').val());
[15:47:45] <Baako> seem to work but it doesnt work as a variable
[15:47:55] <doug64k> lol I managed to crash the tab in chrome :D
[15:49:04] <robertmaxrees> Baako can you make a fiddle?
[15:51:39] <doug64k> code that pools rows but not fully debugged http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/16/
[15:51:44] <doug64k> dmsuperman: ^
[15:52:23] <dmsuperman> well it doesn't work! :P
[15:53:15] <Baako> http://jsfiddle.net/c1fznrx0/
[15:53:29] <Baako> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/c1fznrx0/
[15:53:51] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c1fznrx0/1/ works fine.
[15:54:00] <robertmaxrees> are you not seeing the alert before the form submits?  is that the issue?
[15:54:38] <doug64k> dmsuperman: lol
[15:55:17] <doug64k> dmsuperman: http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/17/
[15:56:06] <dmsuperman> oof, lag is bag
[15:56:09] <Baako> robertmaxrees i am not seeing anything
[15:56:14] <dmsuperman> back*
[15:56:21] <robertmaxrees> Baako even on my version?
[15:56:23] <robertmaxrees> because it works.
[15:57:47] <doug64k> dmsuperman: http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/18/
[15:57:49] <doug64k> yeah?
[15:58:35] <dmsuperman> yeah, still quite laggy
[15:58:57] <doug64k> dmsuperman: reuses rows though http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/19/
[15:58:57] <dmsuperman> honestly I thought whatever you had after you switched to the batched dom changes __joshua__ suggested (I believe) was great
[15:59:19] <dmsuperman> 0-2ms unless I physically grabbed the scrollbar
[15:59:30] <dmsuperman> then it shoots up to 20-40, but probably because I scrolled really fast
[15:59:53] <Baako> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/c1fznrx0/ doesnt work
[16:03:20] <robertmaxrees> Baako http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c1fznrx0/2/ does
[16:03:30] <robertmaxrees> including jquery makes it work fine, sooo..
[16:17:06] <Jeroen_> Hi, I've got 10 divs all with th eclass "room" is there a posibility to get the latest div's value on the page with JQuery?
[16:18:58] <robertmaxrees> "the latest div"?
[16:19:18] <Jeroen_> well tr exactly
[16:19:21] <Jeroen_> I've got: <td class="roomId">@r.roomId</td>
[16:19:29] <robertmaxrees> define "latest"
[16:20:09] <Jeroen_> each <td class=roomId">10</td> has a number in it. (like 10 here) and I need the latest on the page to get the ID I need for later in the script.
[16:20:12] <Jeroen_> How could I do that?
[16:20:21] <Robdgreat> you're not defining "latest"
[16:20:23] <robertmaxrees> again - define "latest"
[16:20:28] <Robdgreat> you just keep using the word over and over
[16:20:50] <robertmaxrees> do you mean "most recently added"? or "the one that shows up last"?
[16:20:53] <Jeroen_> <td class=roomId">10</td> <td class=roomId">11</td> <td class=roomId">12</td> <td class=roomId">13</td> (I need to get the 13) :)
[16:21:06] <Robdgreat> so, one that shows up last
[16:21:13] <Robdgreat> here's to precision in language :D
[16:21:18] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[16:21:22] <robertmaxrees> you'd use .eq(-1)
[16:21:35] <Jeroen_> $(".roomId:last").val();
[16:21:36] <Jeroen_> doesn't work.
[16:21:50] <robertmaxrees> you want .text(), not .val()
[16:22:10] <robertmaxrees> and I'd use .eq(-1), instead of :last, but that's me.
[16:22:21] <Robdgreat> and is :last functionally equivalent to .eq(-1) ?
[16:22:25] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[16:22:28] <Robdgreat> sweet
[16:22:28] <Jeroen_> works! :D
[16:22:32] <robertmaxrees> iirc .eq() is going to be a bit faster.
[16:25:19] <Jeroen_> Thanks
[16:28:02] <doug64k> dmsuperman: smooth? http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/21/
[16:29:19] <doug64k> dmsuperman: it won't go over 3ms holding pagedown on my laptop
[16:32:17] <doug64k> the worst I can get with the mouse is 8ms
[16:32:52] <checkit> Having trouble getting this to work: $('.has-warning').each().removeClass('has-warning');
[16:33:15] <dmsuperman> doug64k: can you go back to using letters? I just realized maybe the lag was the font issue again
[16:33:21] <dmsuperman> the console reports low numbers
[16:33:28] <dmsuperman> but I get the multi-second-lags
[16:33:32] <__joshua__> $('.has-warning').each(function(){ $(this).removeClass('has-warning'); });
[16:33:37] <robertmaxrees> checkit you shouldn't need the .each()
[16:33:51] <__joshua__> yeah, listen to robertmaxrees
[16:34:28] <doug64k> dmsuperman: http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/22/
[16:34:33] <Korvin> I'm trying to work out why I can't focus inputs in an edge case, running $(document).unbind() fixes it, what exactly does that do?
[16:34:44] <Korvin> does it unbind every event on document and every node under document?
[16:34:46] <Korvin> or just document?
[16:34:49] <doug64k> dmsuperman: I'm on linux mint so you might have totally different font performance
[16:35:07] <dmsuperman> hey there you go
[16:35:19] <dmsuperman> and actually that fixes my physical scrollbar drag performance drop as well
[16:35:22] <dmsuperman> nothing above 5ms
[16:35:42] <dmsuperman> nothing above 2ms if I just use trackpad
[16:35:59] <dmsuperman> and yeah pgdn alternates between 0 and 1ms
[16:36:10] <doug64k> awesome. desktop cpu I assume?
[16:36:16] <doug64k> cpu/gpu
[16:36:18] <dmsuperman> mac book pro i7
[16:36:22] <dmsuperman> I think it's the mobile i7
[16:36:29] <dmsuperman> but i7 nonetheless :)
[16:36:51] <doug64k> ah. I have a more modest but very recent pentium M 2.3GHz
[16:37:20] <doug64k> stripped down haswell with no avx and a lot less l3
[16:37:38] <dmsuperman> I think you've done it here
[16:37:47] <dmsuperman> were there any other optimizations to consider?
[16:37:57] <dmsuperman> or are you gonna start putting in some real world data and see?
[16:38:38] <doug64k> it's fast enough now
[16:39:00] <dmsuperman> hell yeah
[16:39:02] <dmsuperman> nicely done
[16:39:03] <doug64k> all the input helped
[16:39:08] <dmsuperman> :)
[16:39:09] <dmsuperman> glad to help
[16:39:09] <doug64k> a lot
[17:08:18] <doug64k> lol, added a mechanism to try to limit the update cycle to 8ms, and if it goes over, schedule to do more work 8ms from now
[17:08:20] <doug64k> http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/25/
[17:12:25] <doug64k> http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/26/ make all changes offscreen again
[17:17:35] <doug64k> I wonder if there is anything to be gained by using requestAnimationFrame to defer the display update until the right moment
[17:19:59] <__joshua__> probably, but i can't speculate on the significance
[17:20:17] <__joshua__> it would certainly do it, however
[17:35:51] <sammych1> so I have these images saved as data-uri's as clobs in my db. Can I serve them up as-is or do I have to convert them to binary images?
[17:36:38] <robertmaxrees> are they base64 encoded?
[17:36:41] <sammych1> yes
[17:37:09] <sammych1> i'd expect them to be served up via a GET request
[17:37:12] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/data-uris/ as lonng as the format is right, you're fine.
[17:37:24] <sammych1> I'm not embedding them in the HTML
[17:37:26] <sammych1> or CSS
[17:38:09] <sammych1> http://server/images/getImage?id=1234
[17:38:28] <sammych1> I really don't want to write a servlet
[17:39:05] <sammych1> bottom line, I was hoping for a way for a src attribute to load data-uri
[17:39:13] <sammych1> remotely
[17:44:15] <doug64k> deferred with requestAnimationFrame http://jsfiddle.net/exonagvL/27/
[18:26:01] <Mark___> anyone alive ?
[18:28:55] <Moya> :D

[18:47:19] <goingcrazy> Hey Everyone :)  I really need some help with a slider on my homepage.  The slider gets stuck dragging if clicked on and on mobile instead of being directed to product when clicked on, the image just reloads itself.  The adventure time image in the slider is what I am referring to.  www.diceygoblin.com
[18:53:45] <doug64k> goingcrazy: what made it draggable to begin with?
[18:54:20] <doug64k> I got stuck in drag and couldn't let go
[18:54:23] <goingcrazy> doug64k, I am not sure.  However, I changed this  desktopClickDrag:      from true to false and it is still happening
[18:55:05] <doug64k> which plugin
[18:55:59] <goingcrazy> doug64k, here is the code for the slider   http://pastebin.com/sVjxB6ru
[18:56:25] <goingcrazy> doug64k, iosslider is the name of the plugin
[18:57:51] <doug64k> $(element).iosSlider('lock');
[18:58:07] <doug64k> Locks the slider. Temporarily disabling touch/drag events within the slider without unbinding them.
[18:59:04] <doug64k> goingcrazy: ^
[18:59:27] <goingcrazy> doug64k, do I just add that?  Sorry, I am really confused on this.
[18:59:28] <goingcrazy> :(
[18:59:58] <doug64k> goingcrazy: what you want is to disable drag right?
[19:00:51] <goingcrazy> doug64k, I want to disable the drag but still allow people to click the image to view that product, also, on mobile phone, iphone especially, the slider when clicked on, just reloads the image every time its clicked on rather than taking person to product
[19:05:01] <doug64k> goingcrazy: so you aren't even going to try it?
[19:05:24] <doug64k> I got stuck in the drag, so something isn't right
[19:05:25] <goingcrazy> doug64k, yes, but I am not sure where to put it, I do not know jQuery that well.
[19:06:28] <doug64k> http://pastebin.com/EC7fhKbD
[19:07:06] <doug64k> what's handling the click?
[19:07:34] <goingcrazy> I thought it was this: desktopClickDrag: false,
[19:08:17] <thinkxl> using $.ajax on `error: function(jqXHR, text, error) { console.log(jqXHR.status); }`
[19:08:19] <thinkxl> I got `0`
[19:08:48] <thinkxl> http://cl.ly/image/0c2d0j292O01
[19:08:55] <thinkxl> this is the response
[19:09:02] <thinkxl> I should get `400` I guess
[19:09:07] <goingcrazy> doug64k, that broke the slider
[19:09:16] <thinkxl> any reason why I'm getting 0?
[19:09:56] <doug64k> goingcrazy: ok, I think your issue is with those callbacks
[19:10:10] <doug64k> or you have a click handler that isn't doing something right
[19:10:37] <doug64k> it's all minified on that site right?
[19:10:50] <goingcrazy> dough64k, yes
[19:11:21] <goingcrazy> the best sellers slider was doing the same thing, i had to disable the desktop drag but with this one, I cannot locate the issue
[19:18:45] <Mark___> um,
[19:18:45] <Mark___> can anyone take a look at this page and tell me what kind of script it is? https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/wd
[19:18:46] <Mark___> i think several css codes are mixed together
[19:18:47] <Mark___> is it just css or does it require jquery? how do i emulate the logo fading in when i scroll to the top? very difficult.
[19:21:39] <goingcrazy> dough64k, any suggestions on what I should try, I am at a loss
[19:23:46] <goingcrazy> doug64k, any suggestions on what I should try, I am at a loss
[19:27:10] <goingcrazy> doug64k, I was able to get it to stop dragging on desktop :)  Still stuck on the iphone/mobile issue however, where it will not go to product, it just reloads image when clicked.
[19:27:31] <doug64k> goingcrazy: I asked about click handlers. what code makes click work
[19:27:42] <doug64k> do you have a click handler?
[19:28:53] <goingcrazy> doug64k, I am not sure.
[19:30:18] <doug64k> goingcrazy: you aren't the author of the code? you don't have the source code?
[19:30:27] <doug64k> just the minified code?
[19:30:31] <goingcrazy> doug64k, it is a template.
[19:43:16] <goingcrazy> doug64k, could it be this?  jQuery('.ajax-fancybox').fancybox( 					{ 					   hideOnContentClick : true, 					   width:600, 					   autoDimensions: true, 					   type : 'iframe', 					   showTitle: false, 					   scrolling: 'no', 					   afterLoad: function(){
[19:52:08] <goingcrazy> doug64k, I think I may have found where the issue is coming from, please look at this:  http://pastebin.com/s2FG7bca
[19:58:39] <slavka`_> hey guys, im eveluating the following plugin https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie#readme but i can't see a way to retrieve a cookie value with a path option... is there a way to do this?
[20:01:10] <htrap> hey i was trying to package a gem rails-assets-jquery, but there is no licence file in the directory. Please  guide me as of who to contact for the licence file
[20:01:28] <doug64k> goingcrazy: I suggest making that code run before the iosSlider code
[20:02:44] <goingcrazy> doug64k, it does actually
[20:04:57] <doug64k> goingcrazy: that just plays with the css
[20:05:14] <goingcrazy> doug64k, ok :(
[20:06:10] <doug64k> goingcrazy: look for .on('click   or .click(function
[20:07:37] <doug64k> goingcrazy: show me the code that makes it go somewhere when you click it
[20:08:11] <goingcrazy> this is the only code for that in that file: jQuery(window).on('orientationchange', function(e){ 		setTimeout(function(){ 			jQuery('.iosSlider').iosSlider('update'); 		}, 500); 	});
[20:08:21] <slavka`_> anyone got any suggestions for me?
[21:13:52] <andreic> hi there, I'm using jQuery UI draggable, after upgrade to 1.11 (from 1.10) I found it seems always add .ui-draggable-handle to my draggable element even if i set addClasses to false and didn't set handle. Is it intended or I should change my settings? thx
[21:16:17] <Velveeta> andreic: i just skimmed the source for 1.11, and it seems to always add that class regardless of anything you do
[21:16:34] <Velveeta> if you specify a handle element, it assigns it to that, otherwise, it assigns it to the target element itself
[21:17:02] <jphase> oo snap, the FM was just RT'd :o
[21:17:09] * jphase waves at cheesy
[21:17:15] <Velveeta> heya jphase
[21:17:21] <Velveeta> the FM?
[21:17:27] <jphase> hehe, RTFM'd
[21:17:36] <jphase> in a kind way, that is
[21:17:54] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha :D
[21:20:26] <andreic_> Velveeta: lost my connection.. ok i get it, then i'll leave it there, thank you very much
[21:22:05] <Velveeta> yeah, the way it's written, there's nothing you can do to avoid it
[21:35:34] <DoctorMonocular> hey everyone, I'm having an issue using bootstraptour -- one of the elements I have on my tour already triggers a popover, so when the tour gets to that element, the original popover triggers and the tour cannot continue
[21:35:38] <DoctorMonocular> is there a workaround?
[21:50:14] <grodt> hello
[21:50:32] <grodt> is there a way to have a jquery if statement always checking?
[21:50:45] <Velveeta> what do you mean?
[21:50:57] <jphase> setInterval?
[21:51:23] <grodt> I have a jquery slideshow, and I want to detect if slide #2 is detected, then do something, right now I check via, num = $('.cycle-slideshow').data("cycle.opts").currSlide;
[21:51:54] <grodt> but I can only run that one time, how can I make an if statement that is always active
[21:51:55] <Velveeta> if you set up something like that on an interval poll, it's gonna be a pretty expensive operation
[21:52:06] <grodt> hmmm
[21:52:13] <Velveeta> i would just do your if check in whatever function cycles your slideshow
[21:52:21] <grodt> ok will check, thanks

[22:20:51] <abailarri> Hello. I have a web with some JS scripts. I changed the wb to https and now the JS not work. I need to do something?
[22:23:15] <doug64k> http://www.jstraight.com/1116/8/show  <-- appreciate it if someone can test this and let me know if it works well
[22:24:09] <doug64k> http://www.jstraight.com/1116/8   <-- code
[22:28:52] <grodt> does anyone here take melatonin
[22:29:28] <Uhkis> :D
[22:29:33] <Uhkis> doug64k: works fine
[22:30:10] <emanu> hey guys, anybody here?
[22:30:49] <doug64k> Uhkis: ty
[22:31:16] <grodt> Uhkis, you use cyber for exhaustion?
[22:31:18] <Uhkis> doug64k: now all we need is a font with full utf-8
[22:31:25] <doug64k> Uhkis: yeah
[22:31:44] <doug64k> Uhkis: a lot is there in linux mint 17
[22:31:47] <emanu> Are there any good tools that can introspect the browser environment and provide some information on how our frontend code is doing?
[22:32:13] <grodt> emanu, chrome dev tools
[22:32:43] <Uhkis> doug64k: a lot here too but far from full
[22:32:52] <emanu> like, I notice my team doing things like: writing event handlers into the dom and then redrawing the node that creates the handlers dynamically, so things get re-attached
[22:32:53] <emanu> etc etc
[22:33:01] <emanu> I know chrome dev tools gives me a lot
[22:33:22] <emanu> but I'm currently building a hotkey that shows an overlay with a bunch of stats I manually measure about our code
[22:33:49] <emanu> and I'm curious if there's existing plugins that can get me some of this code-quality info I'm manually collecting
[22:33:49] <doug64k> emanu: a buildup of callback handlers you mean?
[22:34:03] <emanu> doug64k: yes, among other standard bad-practice things
[22:34:22] <doug64k> lol
[22:34:25] <emanu> currently, I'm finding the problem, instrumenting it and reporting it on this "client developper dashboard" sort of thing
[22:34:36] <emanu> but it's a lot of work for me
[22:34:49] <doug64k> jquery will mask event handler issues...
[22:34:50] <emanu> we have things like new relic/librato automatically instrumenting our backend
[22:34:58] <doug64k> jq makes sure only one listener is attached
[22:35:23] <emanu> just curious if there's any similar plugins I just don't know about for jquery/frontend
[22:36:21] <doug64k> you would need to intercept, perhaps var oldon = $.fn.on; $.fn.on = function() { ... log it here ...; $.fn.on.apply(this, [].slice.call(arguments)); }
[22:37:02] <doug64k> oops
[22:37:11] <doug64k> you would need to intercept, perhaps var oldon = $.fn.on; $.fn.on = function() { ... log it here ...; oldon.apply(this, [].slice.call(arguments)); }
[22:37:43] <doug64k> that hack has worked for me for other jquery methods
[22:37:49] <doug64k> ymmv
[22:38:58] <doug64k> that will intercept every event handler being added (I think), by intercepting all .on calls
[22:39:12] <doug64k> you can figure out for sure by inspecting the jq source
[22:39:42] <doug64k> .click etc will end up calling .on iirc
[23:11:37] <loudno15e5> hello all
[23:13:19] <doug64k> hi
[23:26:35] <DoctorMonocular> I'm considering building a sort of demo into an app I'm building, that clicks around the interface, maybe types things in, at human readable speeds, to demo how the app should be used. I'm wondering if there is a plugin or something that provides a concise DSL for that sort of thing instead of a nested nightmare of setTimeouts?
[23:37:33] <sinequanon> there is, it's called Gif :)
[23:37:38] <sinequanon> (or video)
[23:48:48] <rkrara> hello everyone
[23:50:03] <loudno15e5> hey!
[23:50:43] <rkrara> Can someone tell me how can I disable an option in the navbar <li><a>option</a></li>
[23:51:48] <doug64k> emanu: http://www.jstraight.com/1116/16 check the mini plugin iife near the top that intercepts all the jquery methods and traces them to the console. you could easily modify that to intercept repeated event handler adds for example
[23:52:12] <doug64k> right now it spams out every call to the console
[23:53:10] <doug64k> rkrara: what navbar
[23:53:11] <emanu> sweet, thanks for this and the earlier advice
[23:53:33] <rkrara> the navbar on jquery mobile
[23:53:50] <emanu> hijacking on is a good idea, I can also use localstorage to track a bunch of things too
[23:54:15] <rkrara> doug64k: there is a navbar widget on jquery mobile
[23:54:36] <emanu> ok, I'm heading out folks. Thanks for the help
[23:58:06] <Mark___> um, guys?
[23:58:18] <doug64k> rkrara: try .addClass('ui-disabled').attr('href', '#')
[23:58:35] <doug64k> or
[23:58:46] <Mark___> does anybody know how to put background video on a webpage that doesn’t use jquery?
[23:59:06] <doug64k> oops
[23:59:40] <rkrara> doug64k: I added class="ui-disabled"
[23:59:45] <doug64k> Mark___: see ##javascript for "doesn't use jquery"
[23:59:54] <rkrara> doug64k: it seem to work
