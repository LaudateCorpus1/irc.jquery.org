[00:01:16] <jancoow> Hi there
[00:02:40] <jancoow> I've a question. I need to get the outer row from a element inside. The layout is looked like this: <table><tr %I need this TR%> <table><tr> <td> <button>I click this button </button> </td> </tr></table>  </tr></table>
[00:03:04] <jancoow> how can i achieve this
[00:03:08] <taplar> that's not valid markup
[00:03:18] <taplar> your inner table needs to be in a td
[00:03:35] <jancoow> oh true, i 've that, just typed it here wrong
[00:04:19] <taplar> in that case if you click that button it would be $(this).closest('table').closest('tr')
[00:04:21] <jancoow> I can reach my first tr fine with .closest('tr'), but when i want to get the outer TR with .closest('tr').closest('tr') it doesnt owrk
[00:04:39] <jancoow> i will try that!
[00:05:26] <jancoow> thank's, it works! Why would my estimitanion with 2 times closest('tr) not work?
[00:05:34] <taplar> closest() can match the element you are operating on, iirc, so closest(x).closest(x) doesn't do anything
[03:47:46] <int-main> I have a string like var str = "It's awesome" and I want to update it into HTML but using .text(), ' is getting converted to some accented characters
[08:31:16] <NTrash> Hello guys, I've successfully written a jquery script that performs form validation on a webpage, however the .ajaxSubmit() part of the application does not send the validated data to the server. If anyone can help, here's the link: https://jsfiddle.net/c8peg197/

[09:27:18] <jak2000> when user press the button with class: btnAdd how to refer to input at the left? https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/Lb3pp5m2/1/

[10:18:23] <anli> Which event does jcrop trigger when I press esc to close the cropbox?
[10:39:35] <connectnodecc> I am sending a $.ajax with raw multipart form data in the form of a string.  The problem is, $.ajax doesn't add the necessary content-length header, and due to security restrictions I can't set the length on the header myself.  How can I get jQuery to automatically add the header?
[10:41:56] <connectnodecc> ;(
[12:52:16] <NTrash> Is this the correct approach to submit form after validation? http://codepaste.net/p8emoj
[12:52:48] <taplar> no, the ajaxSubmit does it for you
[12:53:32] <taplar> just put the 'support.php' as the action of the form and do $(form).ajaxSubmit() iirc from the docs
[12:54:01] <NTrash> How could I write it with $.post() ?
[12:54:17] <taplar> put the method of the from as post most likely
[12:55:12] <NTrash> So should this work? http://codepaste.net/hn51e3
[12:55:45] <taplar> why are you doing $('#form') ?
[12:56:20] <NTrash> I didn't check it properly, sorry. http://codepaste.net/j4jgzm
[12:56:46] <taplar> no, if your going to use ajaxSubmit, you don't write the ajax request yourself
[12:56:51] <taplar> that's the whole purpose of using it
[12:57:03] <taplar> it does it for you
[12:57:14] <taplar> do one of the other man, :)
[12:57:18] <taplar> *or
[12:57:38] <NTrash> I've been specifically told to use $.post() to perform validation
[12:58:09] <taplar> <form action="support.php" method="POST">...</form>    $('form').ajaxSubmit();
[12:58:22] <taplar> afaik that would perform an ajax request to support.php as a post

[13:01:17] <NTrash> I've written a jquery script that performs form validation, however the .ajaxSubmit() part does not send the validated data to the server. Here's the link: https://jsfiddle.net/c8peg197/
[13:03:40] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c8peg197/3/
[13:05:29] <NTrash> Don't I need to send the data to the server once validated?
[13:05:43] <taplar> the plugin does all that
[13:06:04] <taplar> check the network request when it sends, it's including all that as a post
[13:06:51] <taplar> the purpose of ajaxForm() and ajaxSubmit(), all those guys, is to let people continue to write plain jane html forms, and then quickly turn them into ajax requests without any work on their part
[13:08:55] <NTrash> Really appreciate your help, thanks.
[13:09:03] <taplar> sure
[13:11:27] <NTrash> Could you explain why you set action="/echo" in the form?
[13:12:15] <taplar> that is one of the endpoints jsfiddle has for testing ajax requests
[13:12:24] <taplar> i did that so it wouldn't die trying to hit an invalid url
[13:13:13] <taplar> on the LHS there's an "AJAX Requests" label that expands to show them
[13:13:32] <NTrash> okay
[13:15:31] <anli> I want to add a "radar" that is a div showing the document where the mouse is magnified
[13:15:41] <anli> Maybe a canvas would do...
[13:15:59] <anli> the document near the mouse should be visible in the "radar"
[13:52:04] <deecee> I had a fiddle all set up to show what was going wrong, and I finally realized that the syntax is ".html(newHtml)", not ".html = newHtml".
[14:26:38] <Jon_R> Simple cross-frame scripting question: if I control the web servers on both domains A and B, can I set things up so that I can have a web page served by domain A which includes an iframe from page B, and scripts on the page from A can see inside the iframe, but the code inside the iframe from B cannot see the outer page?
[14:45:31] <Terens> hello
[14:46:02] <Terens> is there a way to jQuery(window + ",.myclass").scroll(function() {	 somehow?
[14:48:11] <deecee> Terens: your question is kind of confusing. are you having trouble selecting something?
[14:49:43] <Jon_R> my guess would be scrolling two things at once
[14:50:43] <Terens> ?
[14:51:53] <Terens> this did the trick 	jQuery([window,jQuery('.col-3').get(0)]).scroll(function() {

[19:40:10] <sector_0> does jquery have an alternative/fallback for the native FormData feature?
[19:40:44] <sector_0> I'm looking for a 'FormData' fallback for browsers that don't yet support it
