[04:00:27] <hellyeah> what is split of jquery version?
[06:00:18] <hellyeah> what is the difference between normal execution and immediate execution?
[06:36:55] <hellyeah> is it possible to check spesific element has spescific data attr?
[06:37:05] <hellyeah> some element doesnt have any data attribute
[06:43:53] <hellyeah> come on
[06:43:55] <hellyeah> no one here
[06:43:56] <hellyeah> :D
[07:38:44] <hellyeah> how is it false event.target.closest('tr').find('td')
[07:45:59] <shoky> event.target is not a jquery obj
[08:02:01] <AdamPDotty> $(event.target) *eg*
[08:44:19] <hellyeah> okey thanks
[08:44:33] <hellyeah> $(event.target).closest('tr').find('td').find('tr[data="updatablefield"]').attr('contenteditable', 'true'); is there anything wrong in that line?
[08:45:12] <MikeD_> you really have a TR that's a child of a TD ?
[08:45:47] <hellyeah> wut
[08:45:50] <hellyeah> :D
[08:46:48] <hellyeah> tr - td
[08:46:53] <MikeD_> it's not "wrong" but it does smell funny... i'd have to check the code comment on the line before to see what you wanted that line to do :)
[08:46:55] <hellyeah> is that false?
[08:47:19] <hellyeah> let me explain
[08:47:19] <MikeD_> table rows contain table details
[08:47:39] <hellyeah> i just have td that has data updatablefield
[08:48:11] <hellyeah> oh damn,
[08:48:18] <MikeD_> $(event.target).closest('tr').find('td[data="updatablefield"]').prop('contenteditable', 'true')
[08:48:19] <hellyeah> i am fool
[08:48:20] <hellyeah> a sec
[08:48:31] <hellyeah> i just wrote tr two times
[08:48:42] <hellyeah> sorry
[08:49:10] <MikeD_> np, there is a case of markup where that line might have been correcy but then i'd point at laugh at your table-based layout
[08:49:53] <hellyeah> gimme a sec
[09:08:14] <hellyeah> this is what i am after https://jsfiddle.net/mxg29obs/2/
[09:35:04] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/ line 1-5 I suppose this function returns TRUE or FALSE...correct?
[09:37:25] <dimi1947> is there anyway the console of chrome dev tools cannot loose it's content when refreshing?
[09:45:34] <tsukasadt> Can anyone tell me while jQuery $.ajax() would return a parsererror resulting from "Unexpected token :" on line 1 at character 15 (the first colon of the response) for: https://thepasteb.in/p/Bgh9cj5oBE85mFW
[09:45:40] <tsukasadt> why*
[09:46:55] <tsukasadt> I've validated the JSON string, which is created using PHP json_encode(), via three different parsers, but jQuery keeps erring. :S
[09:47:36] <shoky> what's that  while(0);   ?
[09:48:29] <tsukasadt> Not sure, it's thrown in by the server I'm querying, but the jQuery seems to ignore it for my other calls.
[09:49:09] <shoky> huh.. well it's not valid json with that in there..
[09:49:12] <tsukasadt> I have the $.ajax() setup as part of a function where all I do is provide the call URL and callback function.
[09:49:41] <shoky> tsukasadt: what's the content-type header of the response
[09:49:42] <tsukasadt> The while(0); is included in the response from the server for every call.
[09:49:51] <shoky> well it's not valid json.
[09:50:02] <tsukasadt> Content-Type: application/json
[09:55:35] <tsukasadt> shoky, here's the URL and raw results for one that doesn't err (accounts) and the one that does (users): https://thepasteb.in/p/VmhLcJYKV1K4niW
[09:57:08] <shoky> tsukasadt: neither of those is valid json.  it seems maybe you've got something that is trying to read that as JS code, not JSON
[09:58:34] <tsukasadt> Except it's literally the exactly same $.ajax() call. Why would one work while the other errs?
[09:58:39] <shoky> i'm familiar with 'while(1)' hacks to prevent loading your json url via a <script> tag.  no idea what while(0);  is supposed to do.  but either way, you'd need special processing on the client side to parse it, as it's not valid json
[09:59:13] <shoky> i don't know, haven't seen your code. maybe some lib is doing something you're not aware of. who knows
[10:06:08] <tsukasadt> shoky, here's the function I'm using and basic test calls to make sure I'm getting the data, but no processing/manipulation of it: https://thepasteb.in/p/xGh4cw1pQk0yNCG
[10:15:54] <shoky> tsukasadt: that code does not work with the "json" you showed before. something else is going on, donno. if you got a live link i can take a look
[10:18:21] <tsukasadt> Odd, because it it working for all the calls I make other than to the users path. As for a live example, I'm afraid the live links are permission-restricted. I guess I'll need to reach out to the server/api provider. Thank you for taking a look. :)
[10:18:26] <tsukasadt> it is*
[10:20:56] <shoky> np
[13:03:11] <pippuccio76> HI at all, i have a problem with a function , this is my javascript : https://jsfiddle.net/dL7wo8ad/   but i have this error :inserisciRecord:1960 Uncaught ReferenceError: calcola_prezzo_venditore_totale is not defined           Why ?
[13:04:36] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 uuuhhh
[13:04:51] <robertmaxrees> you realize that fiddle is almost 6,000 lines, right?
[13:05:49] <Uhkis> but only about 2000 without the pointless new lines! :D
[13:05:59] <Rob235> hey
[13:06:00] <pippuccio76> but there are some code repeats itself
[13:06:09] <robertmaxrees> that alone is a problem.
[13:06:37] <robertmaxrees> and your issue is simple.
[13:06:43] <robertmaxrees> you defined calcola_prezzo_venditore_totale within a document ready handler.
[13:06:50] <robertmaxrees> and then try to use it outside of that.
[13:06:58] <Rob235> when using .one(animationEnd) is there a way to detect if its the last animation when multiple are specified by a comma delimited list such as: animation: 2s ease animName1, 4s linear animName2; ?
[13:08:15] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 also: this looks like you're generationg JS using another language.
[13:08:17] <robertmaxrees> which is a bad idea.
[13:08:47] <pippuccio76> why ? it work
[13:09:07] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 because this is unreadable.
[13:09:11] <robertmaxrees> and super hard to work in.
[13:09:17] <pippuccio76> where i must put the function calcola_prezzo_venditore_totale()
[13:09:31] <robertmaxrees> in a scope that's shared between it being defined and where it gets called.
[13:09:59] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 it looks like you've got two separate doc readys in there.
[13:10:19] <robertmaxrees> just do one.
[13:10:21] <robertmaxrees> that'll fix it./
[13:14:08] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[13:15:23] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x6bzzke9/ this is basically the sisue.
[13:19:30] <pippuccio76> This is my code :https://jsfiddle.net/x6bzzke9/1/
[13:22:01] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[13:22:16] <robertmaxrees> either way, put both of those under a single doc ready.
[13:24:20] <pippuccio76> tere is only one $(document).ready(function()
[13:25:14] <dimi1947> line 63-67 https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/8/ I suppose this function will return TRUE or FALSE...correct?
[13:25:33] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 in the rendered version there are two.
[13:25:39] <robertmaxrees> this is why generating JS is a bad idea :)
[13:26:30] <pippuccio76> sorry this is the last :https://jsfiddle.net/dL7wo8ad/2/
[13:26:57] <pippuccio76> but i have the same problem...
[13:27:40] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 with calcola_prezzo_venditore_totale right?
[13:28:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the generated JS.
[13:28:46] <pippuccio76> now work ...
[13:29:03] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 yes.
[13:29:20] <dimi1947> how am I going to see what gets returned?
[13:29:27] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what do you mean?
[13:29:49] <dimi1947> I want to see this TRUE or FALSE...in the console
[13:30:38] <robertmaxrees> set the returns to vars instead and then log those out before returning them.
[13:30:54] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 alternatively, use your debugger.
[13:30:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/76ybhnkx/9/
[13:31:12] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a GREAT tutorial answering questions like thius.
[13:35:01] <dimi1947> I see you had to edit the function...the way it was before it was impossible to get the value...correct?
[13:35:23] <robertmaxrees> if you use a debugger it's trivial.
[13:35:28] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't have to edit the function at all.
[13:36:02] <dimi1947> sorry...but what do you mean a debugger? the dev tools console for example?
[13:36:15] <hellyeah> hey there
[13:36:20] <robertmaxrees> yes.  i tossed out a link that gives you a tutorial dimi1947
[13:37:05] <dimi1947> give me a second...I just remembered I have an extension that debugs jquery....to see what can I do with this
[13:37:35] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you don't need an extension for it since it's javascript.
[13:37:42] <robertmaxrees> just read the tutorial and you'll be good to go :)
[13:39:12] <dimi1947> ok...thanks....if I have questions,probably the next days since I will be busy reading the totorial
[13:39:21] <pippuccio76> robertmaxrees : now dont work the sum it return NAN
[13:39:22] <robertmaxrees> sounds good.
[13:39:38] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 i have no clue duder.  i'm not about to debug your code heh.
[13:40:23] <pippuccio76> how can i sum a var with a value of an input field?
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 is it a text input?
[13:40:47] <Uhkis> just remember to parseFloat
[13:41:05] <robertmaxrees> because your code was doing somevar = somevar + $('foo').val()
[13:41:07] <robertmaxrees> which is weird.
[13:41:14] <pippuccio76> is this  not ok?
[13:41:18] <pippuccio76>  var valore=parseFloat($('#id_class_prezzo<?=$i?>venditore').val())
[13:41:18] <pippuccio76>       
[13:41:18] <pippuccio76>       prezzo_totale=prezzo_totale + valore ;
[13:41:18] <pippuccio76>    
[13:41:26] <robertmaxrees> yooo don't paste ionto the channel pls :)
[13:41:32] <pippuccio76> sorry
[13:42:01] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle or something.
[13:42:39] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/eoejojoa/
[13:43:20] <robertmaxrees> the rendered JS, yo.
[13:43:25] <robertmaxrees> i dunno php
[13:44:06] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/eoejojoa/1/
[13:44:36] <Uhkis> oh god
[13:44:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:44:43] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:the console of chrome dev tools is the debugger after all...
[13:44:49] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 correct.
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 this is a mess.
[13:45:02] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 you can't technically reuse var like that.
[13:45:28] <robertmaxrees> instead of these dynamically generated IDs, give all those a class like prezzo_venditore
[13:45:38] <robertmaxrees> then a simple .map().get().reduce combo and you're good.
[13:46:57] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/eoejojoa/2/
[13:47:11] <robertmaxrees> that's still pretty bad.
[13:47:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eoejojoa/3/
[13:47:15] <robertmaxrees> ezpz
[13:48:04] <Uhkis> and there's the difference between code and manually setting stuff
[13:48:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:48:15] <pippuccio76> i cannot every row is a result of an ajax call
[13:48:24] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 uh
[13:48:28] <robertmaxrees> that makes no difference in this case.
[13:48:30] <robertmaxrees> literally none.
[13:49:38] <pippuccio76> can i poppulate a class instead a ('#id_class_prezzo<?=$i?>venditore') every $i is a input field
[13:49:47] <robertmaxrees> did you even look at my fiddle?
[13:50:10] <robertmaxrees> because i literally just addressed that :)
[13:54:12] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:this tutorial you gave me is good but hard to navigate...I can only do it with the mouse wheel...is there an alternate way to navigate?
[13:54:25] <robertmaxrees> the arrow keys on your keyboard.
[13:54:36] <robertmaxrees> the spacebar
[13:54:49] <dimi1947> thanks...
[13:55:37] <pippuccio76> now work , the problem was #id_class_prezzo<?=$i?>venditore is not ever a value ...i insert an if to control
[13:55:50] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 just use a class duder.
[13:56:00] <robertmaxrees> it'll make your code 100000x better.
[13:56:07] <robertmaxrees> and that much shorter, too.
[13:56:57] <pippuccio76> i dont very able to use js and i must to rewrite my code :(
[13:57:09] <robertmaxrees> i just gave you a freebie right there.
[14:23:38] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:is a breakpoint going to help in establishing the value returned from the function?
[14:24:57] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 it can.
[14:25:09] <robertmaxrees> you can watch the evaluation of the functions.
[14:25:20] <robertmaxrees> and see what the return evaluates to.
[14:26:57] <dimi1947> well...I used a breakpoint plus added the function as a watch expression and still cannot see to what it evaluates to
[14:28:31] <dimi1947> I can see many info but nothing related to what gets returned from it
[14:28:38] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you can use your console to see.
[14:28:54] <robertmaxrees> so let's say the line in your code is return $(this).prop('foo');
[14:29:18] <robertmaxrees> you set a breakpoint there, then in your console you type $(this).prop('foo'); and it'll print out the result.
[14:29:58] <dimi1947> give me a minute...to check
[14:41:12] <dimi1947> i got undefined which does not make sense...I did what you told me above...
[14:41:36] <robertmaxrees> show the code?
[14:41:53] <robertmaxrees> and a *gasp* screenshot of the console?
[14:41:58] <robertmaxrees> while you're using it.
[14:42:59] <robertmaxrees> wait - you aren't literally doing  $(this).prop('foo'); right?
[14:43:09] <robertmaxrees> you swapped the "foo" out for the actual property name, yeah?
[14:44:23] <dimi1947> what gasp means?
[14:44:30] <robertmaxrees> lol ignore that for now
[14:45:18] <dimi1947> https://1drv.ms/i/s!AjCBrCpLQye-g3cIajnqxzGFvJUc
[14:45:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:45:45] <robertmaxrees> duder
[14:46:06] <robertmaxrees> wrong place.
[14:46:14] <robertmaxrees> completely missed the point.
[14:46:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to set the breakpoint inside inputHasValue
[14:46:39] <robertmaxrees> right now you're stopped before it actually hits that function.
[14:47:47] <dimi1947> I must tell you that the function I want to evaluate is groupHasCheckedBox and NOT inputHasValue
[14:48:00] <robertmaxrees> uuuuhhhh
[14:48:07] <robertmaxrees> then why did you set a breakpoint on the line after it?
[14:48:17] <robertmaxrees> either way, put the breakpoint inside the function itself.
[14:48:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2hebbso6/
[14:49:50] <dimi1947> just a moment to see your fiddle again cause there is something I do not understand...
[14:50:02] <robertmaxrees> and that is?
[14:50:25] <dimi1947> to which exactly line are you referring to in your example?
[14:50:45] <dimi1947> line 3??
[14:50:53] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:50:59] <robertmaxrees> the line below the comment.
[14:51:02] <robertmaxrees> which would be line three, yes.
[14:51:13] <dimi1947> ok...
[14:51:40] <robertmaxrees> what other line would that be referring to?
[14:54:02] <robertmaxrees> so you set the breakpoint ont he same line as the return.
[14:54:09] <robertmaxrees> and then just type out the statement that comes after return
[14:55:39] <Neo2> Hi!
[14:55:57] <Neo2> I need to remove this two slash and put between two http://prntscr.com/ht1msn
[14:56:14] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 fiddle pls
[14:56:23] <dimi1947> https://1drv.ms/i/s!AjCBrCpLQye-g3kWvSc3IAGYEaVq
[14:56:40] <Neo2> there I put float right for spam and all slash moved from left side
[14:56:42] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 reread my last point.
[14:56:53] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 great - fiddle?
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 kill the "return"
[14:57:08] <robertmaxrees> and just do $(this).prop('checked') in your console.
[14:57:41] <Neo2> fiddle takes long time
[14:57:47] <dimi1947> what do you mean to kill it?
[14:57:50] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 bummer :( can't really help then.
[14:57:57] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 erase "return" out of your console.
[14:58:17] <dimi1947> oh
[14:59:24] <dimi1947> I get undefined...if you want I can show you the screenshot
[14:59:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:59:37] <robertmaxrees> what is $(this)?
[15:01:06] <robertmaxrees> (proTip: you can just type $(this) while on that breakpoint and look at the object.
[15:01:07] <robertmaxrees> )
[15:01:52] <dimi1947> at last...something that worked...
[15:02:07] <Neo2> this is fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/6u6Luvj5/
[15:02:48] <Neo2> robertmaxrees: I've put style and // has shifted in front
[15:02:48] <Neo2> .breadcrumbs span{

[15:02:48] <Neo2>   text-align: right;

[15:02:52] <robertmaxrees> NeonKing duuuuuder
[15:02:57] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong autocomplete
[15:03:07] <dimi1947> but again...no clue anywhere what the function returns
[15:03:09] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 don't paste in the cahnnel pls :(
[15:03:18] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what are you actually trying to do here?
[15:03:23] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 so what are you asking?
[15:03:47] <dimi1947> see the values returned by the function,eihter true or false
[15:03:58] <Neo2> type // between words again using jquery
[15:04:13] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 why?  should be done via your server instead.
[15:04:19] <Neo2> see there structure <span> / <span>
[15:04:21] <Neo2> in files?
[15:04:27] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 yes.  on your server.
[15:04:33] <robertmaxrees> don't use jquery to tweak things like that.
[15:04:40] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 okay.  so when you type $(this) are you getting the element you expect?
[15:04:58] <Neo2> there html is right
[15:05:12] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 obviously it isn't if you need additional slashes.
[15:05:17] <Neo2> ok passed this
[15:05:34] <robertmaxrees> oh, i see what you're saying.  your CSS is bad.
[15:05:41] <Neo2> between breadcrumbs? there was there before I added css
[15:05:49] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to float the entire thing to the right, yeah?
[15:05:56] <Neo2> I do translation from LTR to RTL
[15:06:05] <Neo2> there should all words change order
[15:06:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd pick up an i18n library to handle that instead.
[15:06:18] <Neo2> yes for to change order
[15:06:30] <robertmaxrees> because it's more than just floating things right.
[15:07:01] <Neo2> no, would be good if / in <span> tag, and I don't want edit files
[15:07:08] <Neo2> no floating
[15:07:21] <Neo2> I've done a few translation in this way
[15:07:29] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 you're wanting to do internationalization
[15:07:36] <robertmaxrees> which is more complex than thios.
[15:07:37] <robertmaxrees> *this
[15:08:09] <robertmaxrees> i'd just render the site out the right way instead of using css to try to hack a fix into place.
[15:08:12] <Neo2> no, just from LTR to RTL
[15:08:24] <Neo2> oh ok, You are not in theme
[15:08:28] <robertmaxrees> right.  internationalization.
[15:08:38] <Neo2> how to do this, I'll do better faster self
[15:08:40] <robertmaxrees> render it out the right way instead :)
[15:08:45] <Neo2> it's called internationalization?
[15:08:51] <Neo2> I though it's translation
[15:08:59] <Neo2> to translate theme ...
[15:09:12] <robertmaxrees> https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n
[15:09:29] <Neo2> yes
[15:09:50] <Neo2> sense is equal
[15:09:57] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[15:10:03] <Neo2> make in other language
[15:10:05] <robertmaxrees> "translate" implies you're just changing the words.
[15:10:22] <robertmaxrees> you need to design and develop in a way that is consistently sensible to a person in that locale.
[15:10:37] <robertmaxrees> css is not a very good tool to solve that problem.
[15:11:04] <Neo2> good, I've done 2 projects see this http://test1.kselax.ru and http://test2.kselax.ru
[15:11:13] <robertmaxrees> great.  now do them the right way.
[15:11:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:11:30] <Neo2> and now to do third equal and will have still a few 5 probably
[15:11:30] <robertmaxrees> lol both of those urls go to error pages btw.
[15:11:46] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, don't use CSS to solve for this problem.
[15:11:56] <robertmaxrees> use an actual internationalization library.,
[15:11:57] <Neo2> reload again
[15:11:58] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[15:12:44] <robertLunch> kbyeee
[15:13:00] <Neo2> I do in way that I've been learned by guy who is giving me this tasks. it's right way he is doing it long
[15:13:30] <Neo2> how to do right? we create RTL.css file and use RTL languages we include this file
[15:14:06] <Neo2> this styles will apply for all RTL languages, not for determined some, for Arabic, Persian and others
[16:56:37] <z1haze> I have 2 jquery collections, how to I copy the html from one collection of elements to another? It can't be treated like an array, can it?
[16:57:57] <z1haze> scenario is on form submit, I take each submit button on the form (it can have multiple) and store them in a data attribute on the form object, because im manipulating the buttons
[16:58:06] <z1haze> I need to later go back and reapply the old button content to each button
[16:58:44] <z1haze> can i do this? http://dpaste.com/3HG1HSH
[17:33:44] <robertmaxrees> z1haze can you share some markup?
[17:35:15] <robertmaxrees> z1haze because you can do something very similar to that but I'd wonder if there isn't an easier way.
[17:35:22] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - there's an each, no forEach
[17:35:42] <robertmaxrees> ah nvm you're getting help in ##javascript
[17:36:04] <z1haze> different topic in there
[17:36:08] <z1haze> this one is jquery specific
[17:36:22] <robertmaxrees> so you want to change the submit button to some value?
[17:36:26] <z1haze> basically, the end game here is:
[17:37:09] <z1haze> I have to apply a 'loading/processing' animation to the form button when its clicked, and do some trickery behind the scenes to prevent that button from being submitted twice (im not able to use the disabled attribute because our platform doesnt play well with it)
[17:37:30] <z1haze> so im using a data-prop to say yes, the form has been submitted, then just returning false if I have that flag set.
[17:37:42] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so where are you getting stuck?
[17:37:49] <z1haze> Now, if its an ajax form, and we return an error or something other than a page refresh, I need to put the content of the submit buttons back in place
[17:38:07] <z1haze> so for now, in my disableForm function, I take all submit buttons, and store them in the data-prop on the form
[17:38:19] <z1haze> then in my enableForm function, I wanna go through the form submit buttons, and put the original html back in place
[17:38:32] <z1haze> I'm just getting hung up on how to pull an element from a jquery collection by an index is all
[17:38:45] <robertmaxrees> .eq()
[17:38:59] <robertmaxrees> $somejQueryCollection.eq(4)
[17:39:32] <z1haze> so it could be $form.find(':submit').each(function($btn, i) { $btn.html($storedCollection.eq(i) ... ?
[17:40:05] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[17:40:24] <robertmaxrees> though there's a smarter way - are you just trying to restore values?
[17:40:29] <z1haze> yes
[17:40:38] <z1haze> because im changing the html inside the buttons in disableForm
[17:40:41] <robertmaxrees> you have name attributes on all those inputs, right?
[17:40:49] <robertmaxrees> wait - values or actual markup?
[17:40:51] <robertmaxrees> there's a difference.
[17:40:53] <z1haze> markup
[17:40:59] <z1haze> the content of the button
[17:41:23] <z1haze> like <button>submit</button> gets changed <button>processing (loading animation)</button>
[17:41:26] <z1haze> so i need to change it back
[17:41:43] <robertmaxrees> so text.
[17:41:45] <z1haze> some buttons say update, some say continue, some say submit, etc
[17:41:48] <robertmaxrees> just for the buttons?
[17:41:50] <z1haze> yea, but they are html also
[17:41:51] <z1haze> yes.
[17:42:11] <z1haze> my solution currently works for if theres just one button for the form
[17:42:12] <alexweissman> I actually have a plugin that does this...
[17:42:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd give them all a data attribute or some other unique identifier and go off that.
[17:42:17] <z1haze> But I've discovered we have forms with multiple buttons
[17:42:25] <robertmaxrees> instead of by index.
[17:42:27] <alexweissman> don't reinvent the wheel.
[17:42:58] <z1haze> its not very complex though
[17:43:04] <alexweissman> https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/blob/feature-ufform-refactor/app/sprinkles/core/assets/userfrosting/js/uf-form.js
[17:43:15] <z1haze> its basic js, i just was unfamiliar of how to pull a jquery element from a collection using an index
[17:43:16] <alexweissman> feel free to see how it works and adapt if for your needs, then ^^
[17:43:31] <alexweissman> I'm actually planning to refactor it to act as a wrapper around Malsup's Form Plugin
[17:43:57] <alexweissman> (which I was surprised didn't have support for this common feature either)
[17:44:16] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty easy to use CSS to do this instead.
[17:44:20] <robertmaxrees> though that would require markup changes.
[17:44:32] <alexweissman> to save and restore the submit button text?
[17:44:52] <robertmaxrees> to change the text.
[17:45:06] <z1haze> I appreciate that alexweissman
[17:45:12] <alexweissman> np
[17:45:17] <alexweissman> key is these two lines: https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/blob/feature-ufform-refactor/app/sprinkles/core/assets/userfrosting/js/uf-form.js#L76-L79
[17:45:23] <z1haze> But our stuff is basically done and in place in production
[17:45:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:45:33] <z1haze> cant just rip it out, I was just asked to add a bit of new functionality
[17:45:39] <alexweissman> I use $.ajax's `beforeSend` and `complete` to automatically handle the button changes
[17:45:45] <robertmaxrees> heh the problem is it's gonna be error-prone and bug-prone
[17:45:54] <z1haze> but if eq() is what i need then I gues this should be fine
[17:46:05] <z1haze> is eq() the same as .get() ?
[17:46:08] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:46:15] <z1haze> I thought I needed .get
[17:46:21] <robertmaxrees> .get() gives you the dom node.
[17:46:26] <z1haze> oh
[17:46:34] <robertmaxrees> .eq() gives you a new jquery object with that one node in iut.
[17:46:35] <robertmaxrees> *it
[17:46:42] <z1haze> gotcha, thank you
[17:47:48] <alexweissman> seems like a lot of old jQuery plugin projects are making a comeback
[17:48:01] <robertmaxrees> why do you say that?
[17:48:04] <alexweissman> someone took up the jQuery Form Plugin project (malsup's)
[17:48:13] <alexweissman> and I've been working on Select2
[17:48:13] <robertmaxrees> any others?
[17:49:06] <robertmaxrees> so two projects?
[17:49:07] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:49:08] <alexweissman> jQuery Validation seems to be...maintained
[17:49:25] <alexweissman> but desperately needs a new docs website
[17:50:03] <alexweissman> https://github.com/jquery-validation/jquery-validation/releases
[17:50:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:50:17] <robertmaxrees> was already looking.
[17:50:54] <alexweissman> I was thinking about putting together a jQuery plugins coalition of some sort
[17:51:06] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:51:09] <robertmaxrees> what's the goal?
[17:51:26] <alexweissman> maintain widely-used but not widely-loved jQuery plugins
[17:51:45] <alexweissman> it's hard to find good developers to work on jQuery projects these days
[17:52:00] <alexweissman> because it's not a sexy framework
[17:52:11] <robertmaxrees> it's not a framework in the first place ;)
[17:52:16] <alexweissman> but an insane proportion of projects depend on it
[17:52:17] <robertmaxrees> i know what you mean tho
[17:52:21] <alexweissman> well...whatever you wanna call it
[17:52:26] <robertmaxrees> it's a library.
[17:52:34] <robertmaxrees> and lots of people are moving away from it.
[17:52:39] <robertmaxrees> and into the vanilla world.
[17:52:44] <alexweissman> yep
[17:52:51] <robertmaxrees> though there's still absolutely a place for it in a lot of other projects.
[17:52:53] <alexweissman> or to full-fledged frameworks
[17:53:15] <robertmaxrees> kindasoreta.
[17:53:20] <robertmaxrees> jquery never said it was a framework at all.
[17:53:25] <robertmaxrees> just a dom abstraction library.
[17:53:28] <alexweissman> well, even if no one started another new project with jQuery from here on out, there is a metric crapton of code in production that uses it
[17:53:34] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:53:46] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, so does .each not return the jquery object? it just returns the dom node?
[17:53:48] <robertmaxrees> but that doesn't mean they'll update anything./
[17:54:01] <robertmaxrees> z1haze correct - you'd need to wrap it in $()
[17:54:12] <robertmaxrees> either $(this) or whatever you call the element in the callback args.
[17:54:14] <alexweissman> who, the consumers?  or the jQuery community?
[17:54:27] <robertmaxrees> the people maintaining the sites.
[17:54:54] <robertmaxrees> a good chunk are legacy applications with no real desire or need to upda3te.
[17:54:55] <alexweissman> I mean, maintenance is 90% of software
[17:55:01] <z1haze> so do you guys really still use jquery in new development?
[17:55:10] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i do for some thing.
[17:55:10] <z1haze> this isnt a stab or anything, im just curious
[17:55:24] <z1haze> Only time i tend to use jquery anymore is on our legacy s tuff
[17:55:24] <alexweissman> my OSS project has a hard dependency on jQuery atm
[17:55:33] <robertmaxrees> alexweissman sure, and not 100% of deployed applications are maintained ;)
[17:55:40] <z1haze> so does ours, but anything new we write tends to not use it
[17:55:45] <alexweissman> thinking about migrating to Vue, but I need to make sure it's Suitable for Newbs (tm)
[17:55:48] <z1haze> probably pointless though
[17:55:54] <z1haze> yep, we use vue on a lot of stuff
[17:56:08] <robertmaxrees> really depends on the project.
[17:56:11] <z1haze> vue is pretty intuitive
[17:56:19] <alexweissman> I mean just from my experience maintaining Select2, there is still a ton of demand
[17:56:20] <z1haze> moreso than react even
[17:56:26] <robertmaxrees> we have to support back a few versions of IE so some lbraries and frameworks are kind no-go.
[17:56:36] <alexweissman> yeah React, I was told, has a steeper learning curve
[17:56:36] <robertmaxrees> *kind of a
[17:57:26] <z1haze> react still pretty easy though
[17:57:35] <z1haze> angular is where it gets stupid
[17:57:44] <robertmaxrees> i think people get tripped up with the flux pattern more than react itself.
[17:57:51] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, angular is weird.
[17:57:58] <alexweissman> agreed
[17:58:01] <z1haze> ok, so does $.each give a different result than $someCollection.each ?
[17:58:03] <robertmaxrees> great java framework.  too bad they used the wrong language.
[17:58:10] <alexweissman> lol
[17:58:18] <robertmaxrees> z1haze $.each and $.fn.each are for different things.
[17:58:37] <z1haze> im getting a weird error with my .each stuff
[17:58:52] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/ -> "The $.each() function is not the same as $(selector).each(), which is used to iterate, exclusively, over a jQuery object. The $.each() function can be used to iterate over any collection, whether it is an object or an array. In the case of an array, the callback is passed an array index and a corresponding array value each time."
[17:58:55] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me the issue?
[17:58:57] <z1haze>  Cannot read property 'createDocumentFragment' of undefined
[17:59:12] <z1haze> i was trying to narrow down the point at which is breaks but the stack trace is pretty big
[17:59:32] <robertmaxrees> you passing the args in the right order for the callback?
[17:59:39] <robertmaxrees> function(index, element)
[17:59:40] <z1haze> probably not :)
[17:59:43] <z1haze> yep, backwards
[18:00:00] <z1haze> thats unique
[18:00:01] <robertmaxrees> if you're not using fat arrows, 'this' is the same as the element.
[18:00:13] <robertmaxrees> that actually predates Array.prototype.forEach
[18:00:15] <z1haze> thats another thing, i love arrow functions, and i can hardly use then with jquery
[18:00:21] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[18:00:27] <robertmaxrees> you just can't use 'this'
[18:00:30] <z1haze> well yea
[18:00:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:01:39] <z1haze> I want so badly to just completely wipe our application and start from nothing
[18:02:00] <z1haze> trying to explain roi to the business for that, makes it impossible
[18:02:36] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:02:45] <robertmaxrees> there's also a high risk factor that business folks get weird about.
[18:03:33] <robertmaxrees> we're rolling through that right now.
[18:03:50] <z1haze> yeah that too
[18:03:53] <robertmaxrees> transitioning from coldfusion to node.  on the tail end for our biggest site.
[18:05:01] <z1haze> so if i pass a store a jquery collectoin in a data attribute, does that pass by reference?
[18:05:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:05:29] <z1haze> because for some thing, my stored jquery collection, is having the html from after I changed the content, even though I stored it before I changed it
[18:05:40] <robertmaxrees> i'
[18:05:46] <robertmaxrees> *i'd have to see what you're talking about.
[18:06:04] <alexweissman> maybe you can just gradually refactor over time?
[18:06:22] <z1haze> ok robertmaxrees
[18:06:23] <robertmaxrees> z1haze are you storing the jquery object or the html for the element?
[18:06:28] <alexweissman> UserFrosting has evolved from a plate of spaghetti into a structured MVC framework over the course of 4 years
[18:06:41] <alexweissman> never completely had to start over at any point
[18:06:52] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/2Y5ZBVA
[18:06:58] <z1haze> this is my test
[18:07:05] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't tell me much heh
[18:07:14] <z1haze> yeah, I'll walk through it
[18:07:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:07:27] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you what I'm looking for :)
[18:07:28] <robertmaxrees> one se.c
[18:07:35] <z1haze> formIsSubmitted just checks if theres an attribute set on the form if its submitted or not - and that happens in disableForm
[18:07:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2zfgzq1r/
[18:08:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:08:05] <z1haze> also in disableForm if the form has not been submitted, I store the current $('form') object in a data property on the form ok?
[18:08:22] <robertmaxrees> check out that fiddle - it should answer your question.
[18:08:24] <z1haze> then in enableForm, i got back throug $form.data('storedForm') ... and I attempt to reapply the html
[18:08:29] <z1haze> ok
[18:08:42] <z1haze> hmm
[18:08:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2zfgzq1r/1/
[18:08:59] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[18:09:08] <robertmaxrees> it's because the jquery object points back to the dom node always.
[18:09:24] <z1haze> dang
[18:09:26] <robertmaxrees> so anything done to the jquery object (regardless of how it's stored - data elements included) will reflect.
[18:09:31] <z1haze> so how can i actually store that as a unique copy
[18:09:32] <robertmaxrees> but you only care abouty the markup, right?
[18:09:35] <robertmaxrees> not the handlers
[18:09:36] <robertmaxrees> ?\
[18:09:40] <z1haze> for each button, yes
[18:10:00] <robertmaxrees> then store just the htmlk.
[18:10:04] <robertmaxrees> $('foo').html()
[18:10:24] <z1haze> right, I got confused though on how I'd use the array in the data attribute
[18:10:29] <z1haze> and how id push to it
[18:10:35] <robertmaxrees> ezpz
[18:10:38] <robertmaxrees> map()
[18:10:40] <robertmaxrees> sec
[18:11:46] <z1haze> you can map a collection?
[18:11:58] <robertmaxrees> jquery objects support .map(), but there's a catch.
[18:11:59] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you.
[18:12:49] <z1haze> $form.data('storedValue', $submitBtns.map((i, btn) => $(btn).html()));
[18:12:55] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[18:12:58] <robertmaxrees> not that simple.
[18:13:08] <robertmaxrees> becuase you still get a jquery object back - which you don't want./
[18:13:10] <robertmaxrees> one se.c
[18:13:58] <z1haze> i was going to try jsfiddle but its down for me
[18:14:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2zfgzq1r/2/
[18:14:11] <robertmaxrees> ^ does this work?
[18:15:22] <robertmaxrees> actually https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2zfgzq1r/3/
[18:15:24] <robertmaxrees> this is better.
[18:15:47] <robertmaxrees> *depending on the case.  either way, you get the idea.
[18:16:17] <z1haze> yeah, trying to understand the need for .get()
[18:16:38] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/map/ -> "As the return value is a jQuery object, which contains an array, it's very common to call .get() on the result to work with a basic array."
[18:16:41] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:16:52] <z1haze> ah interesting
[18:16:57] <robertmaxrees> gets you out of jquery land and into a native array.
[18:17:03] <robertmaxrees> i use map all the time.
[18:17:19] <z1haze> so that's not this? $form.data('storedValue', $submitBtns.map((i, btn) => $(btn).html()).get())
[18:17:54] <robertmaxrees> roughly the same, but i avoid inlining stuff like that as much as possible.
[18:18:12] <z1haze> i probably would too in this case, but thats pretty small
[18:18:22] <robertmaxrees> and not easily readable :)
[18:18:38] <robertmaxrees> small doesn't mean much to me.
[18:18:56] <robertmaxrees> storing that map in a var at least gives me some kind of clue as to what your intent was.
[18:19:05] <z1haze> so now I can do forEach, yea?
[18:19:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:19:13] <z1haze> sweet
[18:19:15] <z1haze> gonna try this out
[18:30:39] <z1haze> oh yeah, it works. thank you
[18:32:30] <robertmaxrees> rad
[21:14:41] <SideFX> I am trying to figure out what's triggering a jquery datepicker window.  I tried grepping but there are like 1000 instances of 'datepicker' throughout the site.
[21:15:00] <SideFX> Is there a way to track where it's pulling the code from while on the browser?
