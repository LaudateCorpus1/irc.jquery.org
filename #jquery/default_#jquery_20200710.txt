[06:39:52] <wolf3591> Hi, I'm trying to override add jquery-ui accordion to an existing site, I thought I could override the content class with "class" option but it doesn't seem to be working. Any example of such override? https://jsfiddle.net/aram535/phf2tbd6/
[06:49:08] <Cork> wolf3591: not sure what you mean by override unless you mean it should use the right instead of the left
[06:49:17] <Cork> and that is what it does
[06:50:37] <wolf3591> I wanted to use my own existing classes, rather than the default classes
[06:50:47] <wolf3591> my "subItems" class is what I want to collapse
[06:51:09] <wolf3591> by default the h2 is collapsed
[06:52:05] <Cork> ah, ya, that isn't what classes does
[06:52:22] <Cork> it is the classes jquery ui adds to the elements when it initializes them
[06:52:40] <wolf3591> ahhhh ok
[06:53:24] <wolf3591> is there a way to tell ui which class to collapse? or is it auto set in code?
[07:06:07] <Cork> wolf3591: i've looked around in the code familirizing me with the classes feature a bit
[07:06:34] <Cork> wolf3591: what you want to control is what class jquery ui should "look" for when collapsing elements?
[07:08:09] <wolf3591> Yeah, it's an existing site so I don't want to have to rewrite the whole thing to match it to the "default".  If it's possible I want to tell jq-ui which "id" or "class" it should collapse.
[07:08:23] <Cork> if yes, then your missing one of the key construction filosofies of jquery-ui. it doesn't set inline css values to control state
[07:08:34] <Cork> it sets classes and the css does the reset
[07:08:37] <Cork> *rest
[07:09:30] <wolf3591> yeah it may not be in the jsfiddle ... it is in my "test" code which I'm using locally.
[07:09:30] <Cork> so you need to copy the rules from the core css file and set the same rules for your new classes if you want the same behavior
[07:09:49] <wolf3591> Okay, understood. tyvm.
[07:09:55] <Cork> np
[07:11:35] <Cork> wolf3591: for reference: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widgets/accordion.js#L289 => https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widget.js#L562
[07:11:50] <wolf3591> great links thx
[07:13:13] <Cork> opps missed one => https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widget.js#L489
[07:13:26] <Cork> that is how the classes option is used
[07:14:01] <wolf3591> I'm assuming processPanels is really the one doing the work
[07:14:24] <wolf3591> looks like the other toggle and on are just "setup" functions
[07:15:38] <Cork> wolf3591: look for _removeClass, _addClass, _toggleClass in accordion.js
[07:15:41] <Cork> there are a few
