[04:03:11] <haxus> Hello all, I having still problems to understand callbacks. for instance, I have a code in Python https://codeshare.io/GLyJ76 which I want to translate in nodejs. I am guessing that would be a callbackfunction, however I an not able to rewrite it. can anybody help me ? Thanks in advance.
[04:04:29] <Uhkis> haxus: #node.js
[04:07:40] <haxus> please try again https://codeshare.io/GLyJ76, should not be blank anymore.

[07:46:17] <AdamPDotty> webs: button.on('click' nearlysamefunction) does not do?
[13:40:32] <JacquesLacan> Is there some way to "watch" functions as the browser calls them?
[13:41:09] <taplar> you can set breakpoints
[13:41:20] <robertmaxrees> JacquesLacan why do you want to do that?
[13:41:50] <JacquesLacan> After a few seconds the page is loaded, something is being called and messing everything
[13:42:17] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[13:42:25] <robertmaxrees> are you getting errors?
[13:42:34] <JacquesLacan> No
[13:43:03] <taplar> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide10
[13:43:05] <JacquesLacan> Its a grid using tablesorter
[13:44:03] <robertmaxrees> so what's breaking?
[13:46:20] <solsTiCe> hi. anyone fluent in jquery.flot ? I am using the navigate plugint o zoom in and out and I have specified a zoomRange so that You can't zoom out of the data min an d max. But when I zoom out, I can't all my plot. It seems some increment when zooming in and zooming out are done with some increment not a correct multiple or something. How cna I change that ?
[13:51:22] <robertmaxrees> solsTiCe do you have a test case or something we could look at?
[14:04:43] <robertmaxrees> welp
[14:38:29] <taplar> i got one when i fell down
[15:04:38] * robertmaxrees rimshots
[15:04:53] <taplar> lol, i love the delay we had on both of our comments
[15:05:04] <robertmaxrees> :D
[15:08:30] <taplar> i think i'm starting to get addicted to minecraft like games
[15:09:06] <robertmaxrees> why do you say that?
[15:09:36] <taplar> picked up portal knights the other day because I saw a friend playing it.  i've stayed up too late the last two nights messing around, lol
[15:09:54] <robertmaxrees> hah.  those are the best nights sometimes.
[16:52:18] <solsTiCe> robertmaxrees: sorry for the delay. so here it is: https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/546978/ at first the 2 red dots are on the plot. Try to zoom in then zoom out. Then you can't get the 2 red dots back at the time on the plot.
[16:53:24] <solsTiCe> oops https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/546983/
[16:53:50] <robertmaxrees> oh
[16:53:55] <robertmaxrees> plot.getData()[0].highlightColor = "#f00";
[16:54:02] <robertmaxrees> yoou do this all once on pageload.
[16:54:20] <solsTiCe> yes ?
[16:54:27] <robertmaxrees> and then never again.  the library probably adds/removes those elements on zoom.
[16:54:41] <solsTiCe> no no just try it
[16:54:46] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[16:54:52] <robertmaxrees> and i'm 99% sure that's the issue.
[16:55:01] <solsTiCe> it's jsut to demosntrate the problem. it' snot part of the problem
[16:55:10] <robertmaxrees> then what IS the problem?
[16:55:24] <solsTiCe> when you zoom in then out you cna't get the whole plot
[16:55:37] <robertmaxrees> ah
[16:57:59] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/flot/flot/issues/1002
[17:01:15] <robertmaxrees> woops
[17:01:22] <robertmaxrees> anyway you see that?>
[17:01:49] <solsTiCe> well, I don't change zoomRange
[17:02:07] <solsTiCe> after it is set, and it is zoomRange: [1000, end-start]
[17:04:41] <robertmaxrees> i might investigate that route a little more fully since it seems related.
[17:08:44] <solsTiCe> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/547080/
[17:09:00] <solsTiCe> robertmaxrees: ok. but ...
[17:10:50] <solsTiCe> ok. it's because panrange is not the same than zoomrange[1]
[17:11:06] <solsTiCe> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/547090/
[17:12:34] <solsTiCe> working now \o/
[17:33:49] <grid-> hey folks
[17:34:09] <taplar> hola
[17:35:28] <robertmaxrees> oi
[17:36:08] <grid-> i'm using the following script: https://pastebin.com/2aVqNbN4 it will set the url parameter after search= in the variable searchString, it will make % of the spaces in the output, can anyone help me to avoid this?
[17:36:31] <taplar> % or %20?
[17:36:44] <taplar> because %20 is an expected encoding of space in a url
[17:37:57] <grid-> 1234JA 36 will become 1234JA%2036
[17:38:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, %20
[17:38:10] <grid-> so yes, %20
[17:38:41] <grid-> in the url it would be %20 ok but it shouldnt be in the variable itself after i load it
[17:38:52] <taplar> right, the server should decode it
[17:39:09] <robertmaxrees> (the server can't in this case ;) )
[17:39:26] <taplar> what server is it?
[17:39:35] <taplar> and what language?
[17:39:36] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter - it's apart of the hash of the URL.
[17:39:46] <grid-> should i just do var replaced = str.replace(/%20/g, " "); ?
[17:39:58] <robertmaxrees> grid- no, you want decodeURI - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/afLnhj7o/
[17:39:59] <taplar> wait, the hash?  or a param?
[17:40:06] <robertmaxrees> First, get the search parameter. Here I use example.com#search=yourkeyword
[17:40:12] <robertmaxrees> grid- are you popping it after a # ?
[17:40:14] <robertmaxrees> or after a ?
[17:40:43] <taplar> r/param/queryString/
[17:40:55] <grid-> robertmaxrees: yes
[17:40:59] <robertmaxrees> to which?
[17:41:11] <robertmaxrees> is it after a hash or a question mark?
[17:41:32] <grid-> robertmaxrees: it's later being used for  "oSearch": { "sSearch": searchString }
[17:41:40] * taplar sighs
[17:41:44] <robertmaxrees> strike 2
[17:41:48] <robertmaxrees> in the url.
[17:41:59] <robertmaxrees> is it after a # or a ?
[17:42:50] <grid-> taplar: it is jquery on apache
[17:42:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:42:57] <robertmaxrees> in your paste, you have: "Here I use example.com#search=yourkeyword"
[17:43:05] <robertmaxrees> is it supposed to be a #, or a ?
[17:43:10] <grid-> robertmaxrees: the decodeURI function is the best i think
[17:43:25] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:43:31] <taplar> can you please answer the question he's asked three times?
[17:44:03] <taplar> http://myurl?search=weee or http://myurl#search=weee
[17:44:07] <taplar> what pattern is it?
[17:45:03] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:45:05] <robertmaxrees> wtf lol
[17:45:18] <taplar> ?
[17:46:07] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why he's ignoring that quiestion.
[17:46:15] <taplar> ah
[17:46:25] <grid-> robertmaxrees: var searchString2 = decodeURI(searchString); works just fine, sorry i was troubleshooting
[17:46:41] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:46:45] <robertmaxrees> so can you answer the question?
[17:46:53] <robertmaxrees> that we've asked like 5 times now?
[17:47:13] <grid-> robertmaxrees: it is having a # in the url yes
[17:47:30] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:47:50] * taplar erases his server question
[17:49:23] <grid-> when i use var searchString2 = decodeURI(searchString); and i will not set anything in the url even not the #search= i will get undefined in the search box
[17:50:08] <taplar> decodeURI just decodes the string to a new string
[17:50:25] <grid-> i should need a ifset or something i think
[17:52:41] <grid-> https://pastebin.com/3WRjnj59
[17:52:47] <taplar> is there the possibility of the hash having more than one key/value pair?
[17:54:28] <grid-> taplar: sorry to tell you, i have to dump the results, i found the script on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11217023/datatables-how-to-pass-search-parameter-in-a-url
[17:54:38] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:54:49] <robertmaxrees> that's a really hacky solution btw.
[17:55:16] <taplar> i was just asking if there could be more than one, because if so it might make sense to write a little method to parse the hash into an object you could use else where.
[17:55:44] <taplar> since i saw that part where you're getting the index of the search key
[18:00:19] <KDDLB> <+SP9002_@efnet> so, he wants the win. so we're just gonna get lunch or something, then hes gonna push me to the ground and tap my ass with his foot so he can claim he "kicked my ass" tbh im going along with it becase I dont wanna lose any teeth

[18:00:51] <robertmaxrees> *Sigh*
[18:03:27] <taplar> grid-: quick little method  http://jsfiddle.net/jq970u31/7/
[18:10:47] <grid-> taplar: yes
[18:11:21] <grid-> there is only 1 key that i need, maybe soon more, but for now 1 is ok
[20:16:10] <Aprexer> <+SP9002_@efnet> so, he wants the win. so we're just gonna get lunch or something, then hes gonna push me to the ground and tap my ass with his foot so he can claim he "kicked my ass" tbh im going along with it becase I dont wanna lose any teeth
[20:21:54] <how2hack> if i have a function that returns $.getJSON()
[20:22:21] <how2hack> is it possible to chain function.then().then() and get both json objects?
[20:23:40] <how2hack> i mean i need to get two json objects, so i do function('json1').then(function('json2').then((json1, json2) => {});
[21:04:56] <Woet> how2hack: just do a simple if check? if json1 is not null in json2 callback, execute, and vice versa.
[21:07:37] <how2hack> so i don't need something like when? i'm trying this: $.when(getJSON('json1'), getJSON('json2')).then((json1, json2) => {})
[21:07:59] <how2hack> jQuery.Deferred exception: json1.data is undefined
[21:17:58] <how2hack> hmm json1 is the actual $.getJSON object... i thought it would return just the get data...
[21:24:50] <how2hack> how can i access the responseText from both objects?
[21:25:16] <Woet> how2hack: put them in variables
