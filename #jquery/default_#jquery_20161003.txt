[00:31:13] <lucas_ai> I get this error when trying to load jQuery from the chrome console on facebook's website: "refused to load the script". How can I load jQuery?
[00:40:18] <systemfault> Could be CSP
[01:50:22] <Cork> ya, it is
[01:50:58] <Cork> facebook is one of the major reasons selfxss prevention was implemented in browsers
[02:34:03] <MarGul> Don't know if I'm thinking about this wrong. But I have 30 images that needs to be loaded. They are all in an <img> tag. I throught that the webbrowser would download all 30 images async by default but when I look in the inspector tool I can see that it doesn't. Some of them are stalled. Is there a way with jQuery to load all of these images asyncronously?

[02:40:15] <php> Hi
[02:40:32] <php> https://gist.github.com/SysVoid/64712bf3f38ce9033a79dfc683cc3007 - any idea why submitting my form twice shows an error message 3 times?
[02:58:31] <Cork> MarGul: the browsers has a max connections per domain name
[02:58:43] <Cork> MarGul: and no js is also bound by this limitation
[02:59:14] <Cork> MarGul: an option is to set up a second subdomain, pointing it to the same server and spread the resource requests cross them
[02:59:18] <MarGul> Cork, I just saw that now. There is a maximum of 6 TCP connections at one time. Is there a way to go around this?
[02:59:36] <Cork> not from server side no
[02:59:50] <Cork> you can control it from the users config settings
[03:00:00] <Cork> (well in some browsers at least)
[03:01:26] <php> MarGul, you can make a record like *.resource.mydomain.com
[03:01:59] <php> then have the * bit replaced with i, where i is from a loop.
[03:02:13] <MarGul> Is this limitation not applicable on your own domain? Because another site that I have I don't see this "stalled" because it loads images like gif.php?id=X and then that file is just from my webserver. Maybe a bit different when it's on another domain.
[03:02:34] <Cork> MarGul: the limitation is per domain name
[03:02:43] <Cork> and no what domain doesn't matter
[03:03:44] <php> var resources = ["assets/js/mysite.js", "assets/js/woopwoop.js"]; for (var i = 0; i < resources.length; i++) { /* send request to i.resources.mydomain.com/resources[i] */ }
[03:03:52] <php> shitty example
[03:04:03] <Cork> php: you don't need js to solve this
[03:04:09] <Cork> it won't change anything
[03:04:49] <php> So it's max connections per mydomain.com, and not acknowledging subdomains?
[03:05:04] <Cork> it is a max connection per fqdn
[03:05:22] <Cork> but the fqdn isn't something you can work around by js, you need to set up separate domains
[03:05:40] <Cork> and you can just as well pick different sub domains in server script then do it after the fact in js
[03:05:44] <php> I thought that blargh.mydomain.com counted as a fqdn
[03:05:49] <Cork> it is
[03:05:53] <Cork> but why do it in js?
[03:05:53] <MarGul> So if I have one.files.example.com and then two.files.example.com, and so on. And then on the server I loop through this and split the images by 6. So the first 6 images goes to one.files.example.com and the next 6 to two.files.example.com . Does this count as two different domaints?
[03:06:01] <php> Cork, that was just me showing my idea
[03:06:04] <Cork> just set the different fqdn in the <img> tag server side
[03:06:38] <Cork> MarGul: or you can just loop the domain names for each image
[03:06:43] <MarGul> Cork, yes that was my plan.
[03:06:53] <Cork> i meant without grouping
[03:06:54] <php> Cork, I was merely demonstrating my idea of how I would increment is automatically. Can be extended. JS is just an easy way to do it
[03:07:10] <Cork> php: actually it isn't an easy way
[03:07:22] <MarGul> Yes that makes sense. But one.example.com and two.example.com is two different domains even though they are subdomains of the bigger domain?
[03:07:24] <Cork> as you would have to send one url and then modify it (and break the site if js is disabled)
[03:07:33] <Cork> MarGul: yes
[03:07:43] <php> Cork, maybe you find it difficult, but I don't.
[03:08:00] <Cork> php: i didn't say difficult, just over complicated
[03:08:00] <php> or challenging
[03:08:01] <MarGul> Awesome. Thanks a lot. Probably just goin to do a round robin on like 10 subdomains.
[03:08:07] <Cork> you're solving the problem in the wrong place
[03:08:25] <Cork> MarGul: that is what is normally used ya
[03:08:41] <Cork> MarGul: a side note, http2 throws this consept out the window
[03:09:07] <php> Cork, if I was to tackle it properly, I would do the {resource's checksum}.resources.mydomain.com
[03:09:07] <Cork> as it reuses the same connection to multiplex the transfer (and pre send "needed" resources)
[03:09:24] <MarGul> Cork, That's what I saw on stackoverflow. That would have been a great thing. Don't know why it's there in the first place. To try and defend against DDoS?
[03:09:24] <Cork> so if you ever plan to move to http2 you will have to undo this
[03:09:57] <Cork> MarGul: it is cause many server hosters can't handle the load of all the resources getting loaded at the same time
[03:10:17] <Cork> MarGul: originally this number was 2, but browser vendors has slowly been pushing this up to (currently 6)
[03:10:50] <Cork> php: no, you're missing the point, the problem is your trying to solve this client side
[03:11:03] <MarGul> Okey. But my subdomains will just point to the same server anyhow so. But I'm using Azure blob storage and I hope they can handle the load. But it will probably be better than stalled anyhow.
[03:11:07] <php> Cork, the checksum would be done serverside.
[03:11:16] <Cork> php: the entire url should be done server side
[03:11:35] <php> Cork, which is what the checksum idea would be.
[03:11:49] <Cork> ...
[03:11:59] <php> Like I said multiple times, I only used JS to demonstrate my idea.
[03:12:08] <php> I did not use it as best-practice, or "woah amazing"
[03:12:24] <Cork> no you used about the worst possible solution >_<
[03:12:32] <Cork> and is why i protested
[03:12:48] <php> So? Still demonstrated the idea of incrementing per resource to get around the problem./
[03:12:57] <php> Fun fact: for loops are possible server-side!
[03:13:10] <Cork> php: remember that ppl will try to follow you to the letter when you give examples like that
[03:13:15] <Cork> so be careful with what you say
[03:13:30] <php> They're fools if they don't look for the best solution
[03:13:36] <Cork> don't go for the easy (horrible) solutions
[03:13:50] <Cork> make a good explanation of a good solution and let them implement it
[03:14:03] <Cork> php: you apparently haven't been helping ppl much...
[03:14:32] <php> I don't have to give people the best solution. That's spoonfeeding.
[03:14:52] <php> I've never given someone the best answer because it stops them from finding out better ways.
[03:14:53] <Cork> ...
[03:15:06] <Cork> then please keep quiet if someone else is taking the time
[03:15:13] <Cork> you're hurting instead of helping
[03:15:27] <php> I was demonstrating my idea, as I have said multiple times.
[03:15:33] <php> I never finished the example, either.
[03:15:43] <php> You're bitching about nothing.
[03:15:47] <Cork> so did i, except i pointed at the correct location
[03:16:07] <php> "Cork, if I was to tackle it properly, I would do the {resource's checksum}.resources.mydomain.com"
[03:16:10] <php> Remember that?
[03:16:17] <php> That is my idea of an ideal way around this.
[03:16:19] <Cork> ya, except the checksum isn't at all needed
[03:16:34] <php> It might not be, but to me that is how I would ideally tackle it to suit my own style.
[03:16:56] <Cork> the checksum can possibly making the dns and server config very hard
[03:17:01] <php> And it's probably one of the most reliable ways, considering the likelyhood of checksums matching is quite low.
[03:17:10] <Cork> so no, i wouldn't recommend doing it that way
[03:17:34] <php> How could it make configs hard? Wildcards exist in web servers and DNS servers.
[03:17:35] <Cork> (you don't know what software the questee is using, or there skill level)
[03:17:45] <Cork> so keep the answers as simple and correct as possible
[03:18:25] <php> Mine wasn't incorrect. It just wasn't ideal.
[03:18:48] <Cork> it was very incorrect ya; and i'll drop this pointless nagging here; you apparently don't understand the problem
[03:19:01] <php> Tell me how it was incorrect.
[03:19:14] <php> It was possible to pull off.
[03:19:31] <php> Educate me.
[03:22:24] <php> Back to my question before this stuff started: https://gist.github.com/SysVoid/64712bf3f38ce9033a79dfc683cc3007 - any idea why submitting my form twice shows an error message 3 times?
[03:28:43] <Sourcey> Why wont my ajax send the post variable? Or why isnt it recieved correctly at the other end(php) ? http://pastebin.com/sP1U69qf
[03:29:25] <php> Sourcey, is the variable defined within <?php ?>?
[03:29:33] <Sourcey> yes
[03:29:46] <php> you need to echo
[03:29:58] <php> <?= $status ?> or <?php echo $status; ?>
[03:30:01] <Sourcey> ops yes, just saw it. lol thx

[04:01:38] <php> https://gist.github.com/SysVoid/64712bf3f38ce9033a79dfc683cc3007 - any idea why submitting my form twice shows an error message 3 times?
[05:27:58] <theskillwithin> http://devtipsshow.com/killingitwithjquery/
[05:28:33] <Cork> theskillwithin: please stop spamming links
[07:09:56] <Arcarc> Is there a syntactically preferred way of loading a jQuery plugin that doesn't have a selector argument?
[07:10:08] <Arcarc> I've found $.fn.myPlugin(); or $().myPlugin();, but they both look wrong somehow
[07:10:17] <Arcarc> Or should I have a selector argument?
[07:10:23] <Cork> Arcarc: $.myPlugin()
[07:10:34] <Cork> just attach it on jQuery directly
[07:10:35] <Arcarc> Doesn't work for me, and I don't know why :|
[07:10:45] <Arcarc> It's my own plugin, so I guess I've done something wrong
[07:10:46] <decx> why attach it anyway
[07:10:51] <Cork> you most likely attach it on $.fn instead of $
[07:10:55] <decx> just load the module
[07:11:23] <Cork> but ya, it should only be attached if it actually has anything to do with jquery...
[07:11:52] <Arcarc> Hmmmm... that makes sense I think
[07:11:54] <decx> reminds me of $.cookie() which, in the end, saw the light and went native to become Cookies()
[07:12:02] <Arcarc> I wanted to avoid namespace pollution and keep it modularized or something like that
[07:12:19] <Cork> Arcarc: so create window.app and attach it there
[07:12:22] <decx> well export the module and you're goot
[07:12:24] <decx> good
[07:13:11] <Arcarc> Cork: Interesting, I'll look into it
[07:13:22] <decx> good excuse to get into bundling, be it with require or imports
[07:13:47] <Cork> Arcarc: its simple just do windows.app = {};
[07:13:52] <Arcarc> decx: Everytime I hear about modules and so on, terms like "AngularJS", "ReactJS", "Node.js" are attached
[07:13:58] <Cork> then you can do window.app.myFunction = function() {};
[07:14:05] <decx> has nothing to do with that
[07:15:04] <decx> are you using any tooling to compile or transpile your js yet?
[07:15:19] <Arcarc> Cork: Alright, thanks!
[07:15:29] <Arcarc> decx: I don't know what those terms mean, so most likely not!
[07:15:45] <decx> well, use the terms as a starting point
[07:15:55] <Cork> it is if you want a prescript that compacts the js before it is used on the server
[07:16:05] <decx> you'll want to get into that stuff to stay competitive
[07:16:06] <Cork> i'm not a big fan of them my self
[07:16:42] <decx> it's not just compacting
[07:16:58] <decx> it's about using modules without having to put everything into the global scope
[07:17:15] <Cork> you can do that without having to relay on those tools too
[07:17:24] <Cork> i do it all the time
[07:18:03] <Arcarc> I guess some of the infinitely many frameworks and tools will present themselves to me in an appealing manner
[07:18:06] <Cork> so i recommend on reading up on the concept and less on using a specific solution
[07:18:08] <Arcarc> With time
[07:18:24] <Cork> cause the later tends to end with lock-in
[07:18:42] <Arcarc> Cork: The concept of JS modules you mean?
[07:18:42] <Cork> while the concept is something really good to understand
[07:19:02] <Cork> Arcarc: 1. on how to optimize page loading by reducing number of requests
[07:19:29] <Cork> and 2. different ways to structure your js code so you don't have to end up with gigantic global scope blobs
[07:19:38] <Cork> don't mix those two together
[07:19:46] <Arcarc> Ah yeah, I like the sound of that
[07:19:54] <Cork> module is one solution, but it isn't the begin all and end all option
[07:20:09] <Cork> it has it's downsides too
[07:20:21] <Cork> so read up on what you need and want
[07:20:53] <Arcarc> Yeah, that shall be done
[07:21:13] <Arcarc> I have been trying to read up a bit on modules in the last few days, but the resources all make it sound so intimidating
[07:21:26] <decx> it's too much to just read up on
[07:21:31] <Cork> what i do is structure the js statically so it can be separated into files without stepping on each other (through the window.<name>)
[07:21:52] <decx> write a simple project with create-react-app or something
[07:21:54] <Cork> and then i use a simple concat script that removes indentation and merges all the files into one when i push live
[07:22:10] <decx> should give you a great insight in tooling, projectsetups and of course react
[07:22:23] <Cork> that makes debugging MUCH simpler then hard minified scripts, without losing much in bandwidth if you use gzip
[07:23:09] <decx> you dont create a sourcemap?
[07:23:29] <Cork> i don't want to have something writing the script i run
[07:23:40] <Cork> it adds a missmatch layer that causes bugs
[07:24:00] <Cork> the days i end up in a situation where this solution causes problem, i will look into it
[07:24:14] <Cork> but this is simple, reliable, AND _I_ write my code
[07:24:20] <Cork> and that is the code running not something else
[07:24:46] <Cork> (this is my biggest problem with things like coffiescript and typescript too)
[07:25:02] <decx> well i prefer to write modern code and then transpile to whatever target
[07:25:17] <Cork> why write something that end is never used?
[07:25:40] <decx> it's easier to do maintaineble big projects
[07:25:41] <Cork> if you write the code with a compatible structure it doesn't look much more different
[07:25:46] <decx> maintenable
[07:25:49] <Cork> it is less hype; sure but it looks the same
[07:25:57] <Cork> decx: this is a big project
[07:26:12] <Cork> and that is exactly why i want it to be predictable
[07:26:49] <Cork> sure, i implemented something like modules through jquery $.extend and a global scope
[07:26:57] <decx> i dont see how typescript is unpredictable
[07:27:13] <Cork> decx: you write x = z and it does something completely different
[07:27:15] <decx> that's the opposite of its draw
[07:27:16] <Cork> that is the problem
[07:27:32] <Cork> decx: the draws is hard types
[07:27:39] <decx> yeah, being predictable
[07:27:41] <decx> ;)
[07:27:46] <Cork> but as no browser supports typescript it has to be converted into js
[07:27:52] <Cork> and THAT is my problem with it
[07:28:04] <Cork> when you write the code you don't see what the browser will actually run
[07:28:39] <Cork> and from time to time that means you will have to hunt down bugs cause the code you think you write isn't what is actually running
[07:28:42] <Cork> and things go wanky
[07:29:25] <Cork> i've helped enough coffiescript users over the years to know how confusing that gets
[07:29:38] <decx> that'S because coffeescript is shit
[07:29:44] <Cork> yes it is
[07:29:56] <decx> i'm on board with that
[07:29:57] <Cork> but typescript has similar problem, though granted MUCH less
[07:30:07] <decx> but babel and typescript are great
[07:30:37] <decx> imho of course ^^
[07:31:02] <Cork> and the same argument (that i made) is true for all compiled languages all the way down to asm
[07:31:34] <Cork> but the difference is, typescript/coffiescript doesn't give enough advantages over vanilla js to justify the risk of convertion problems
[07:31:58] <Cork> that is at least my point of view for it
[07:32:38] <Cork> i am slowly adopting es6 for the web as browser compatibility comes along
[07:32:45] <decx> well thanks to all the options we have everybody can do what they like best
[07:32:46] <Cork> but i don't see any point in using it before that
[07:33:17] <Cork> as long as we don't push too hard for what we think is the best solution :)
[07:33:23] <Cork> and let ppl find it out them self
[07:33:41] <decx> that's why i like webpack
[07:33:56] <decx> just take all the things that people likle to write in and spit out a cohesive product
[07:34:24] <Cork> uh... i hate those solutions...
[07:34:55] <Cork> those always result in shitty hack solutions
[07:35:29] <Cork> cause then ppl don't bother to learn about the platform they are writing for, and things becomes really badly implemented
[07:41:19] <decx> i dont see how you can say that would result in hacky solutions, the only thing hacky about the ordeal is setting up the build process
[08:02:45] <Cork> decx: i didn't say it would result in it; i said it often result in
[08:03:41] <Cork> decx: basically i prefer when the developer is forced to actually invest some learning into the platform, cause else they don't know how things work and the result _tend to be_ very sub optimal
[08:04:20] <Cork> and yes i'm painting with a very broad brush here and it is far from always the case (though too often for my taste)
[09:25:55] <user_corrupt> does anyone have any idea as to why the following script will alert correctly when it detects 1, 2 or 3, but not 4, 5, 6, or 7? https://jsfiddle.net/c5auw191/13/
[09:26:28] <Cork> user_corrupt: don't use alert for debugging
[09:26:47] <Cork> it forces the browser to take things out of context so you might get effects that aren't real
[09:26:49] <Cork> use console.log
[09:27:45] <Cork> user_corrupt: also index === 0||1||2 isn't valid syntax
[09:28:01] <user_corrupt> I see
[09:28:03] <user_corrupt> thanks
[09:28:38] <Cork> user_corrupt: https://jsfiddle.net/c5auw191/16/
[09:32:23] <user_corrupt> cork: thanks, almost works. Does not detect #4 for some reason
[09:36:35] <decx> why bother with selectable when you can do 3 groups of radiobuttons in a label that you can map
[09:37:12] <Kazuto> user_corrupt: It's not detecting 4-7 because of what Cork said: the syntax JS is interpreting in that first conditional is `index === 0` OR `1` OR `2`; meaning, the "1" evaluates to true and is always caught regardless of what you clicked.
[09:37:49] <Kazuto> So you'll either watch a switch/case or change it to "index === 0 || index == 1..." for the indices
[09:37:54] <Kazuto> want* not watch
[09:40:38] <Cork> user_corrupt: cause it is missing from one of the lists (3 isn't in there)
[09:47:08] <chrisml> how can i make the dropdown stay open? (dropdown nav) https://jsfiddle.net/mbr3ns2y/
[09:48:29] <Cork> chrisml: well by not setting none when you want it to stay open
[09:48:44] <Kazuto> chrisml: Once you hover over it? Or when you load the page?
[09:49:35] <chrisml> yeah, i dunno how to have it so you can hover over the link and the dropdown appears, and you can hover over them too, or hide it
[09:51:07] <xenaxon> hi
[09:51:13] <Kazuto> Hey, xenaxon
[09:51:17] <Cork> chrisml: don't have the mouseenter on the link, but a wrapping element (or better yet, a button)
[09:51:27] <xenaxon> Guys, need some help with a small problem, just can't pinpoint it
[09:51:29] <Cork> chrisml: and move the dropdown into a child of that element
[09:51:35] <Cork> chrisml: then mouseenter will handle it for you
[09:51:50] <Kazuto> xenaxon: What's your issue? :)
[09:52:11] <xenaxon> I have a jquery modal on a page, and on a specific page, instead of JUST opening, it opens and then CLOSES immediately
[09:52:19] <xenaxon> http://www.boostit.net/seo-check/?subaction=16876&action=report
[09:52:45] <xenaxon> this is the page, and the modal is the button "SECURITY CHECK" in the main menu
[09:54:19] <chrisml> Cork like https://jsfiddle.net/mbr3ns2y/1/?
[09:54:38] <xenaxon> @all anybody has any idea why that is happening?
[09:54:40] <Kazuto> xenaxon: When you click on the giant, outlined button on top?
[09:54:41] <user_corrupt> cork: I see what happened now, thanks a lot
[09:54:52] <xenaxon> yes Kazuto
[09:54:57] <user_corrupt> only thing I don't get is the >- 1 part
[09:55:12] <xenaxon> Kazuto: the same with the "get a quote"modal on the left
[09:55:24] <xenaxon> this is not a local problem as you see, it's something applying globally to modals
[09:55:34] <xenaxon> it's closing them immediately after opening
[09:56:18] <Cork> chrisml: yes, but you can't use event.target
[09:56:36] <Cork> chrisml: https://jsfiddle.net/mbr3ns2y/2/
[09:56:51] <Cork> actually, it can be cleaned up even more
[09:56:55] <chrisml> $(this) instead
[09:57:03] <chrisml> yeah don't worry about untidyness
[09:57:05] <Kazuto> xenaxon: Do you have any code pertaining to the modals? If so, which files?
[09:57:09] <Kazuto> s/files/scripts/
[09:57:14] <Cork> chrisml: https://jsfiddle.net/mbr3ns2y/3/
[09:57:22] <Kazuto> Aw, no sed bot in here
[09:57:26] <Cork> chrisml: no it is more the find isn't needed
[09:57:39] <chrisml> Cork cheers
[09:58:16] <xenaxon> Kazuto: I'm not sure where the code for them is
[09:58:19] <xenaxon> have to find it
[09:58:27] <xenaxon> let me see
[10:01:45] <Kazuto> xenaxon: If you have shell access to the site, go to the seo-check directory and run `find . -name "*.js" -type f | xargs grep -l "modal"`
[10:02:13] <Kazuto> That'll recursively search all JavaScript files in the current directory if they have "modal" in them
[10:06:56] <xenaxon> i have the project in netbeans
[10:06:59] <xenaxon> much better search
[10:08:08] <xenaxon> Kazuto: but that is a really bad idea, because the word "modal"appears all over the place
[10:08:24] <xenaxon> Kazuto: Found 1,682 matches of modal in 145 files.	
[10:19:37] <nisseni> I'm doing some image filtering. Setting image object with a certain class to hidden. After that I want to get all id's that aren't hidden. However, they load asynchronous, so I'm getting the previous filtering. I'm trying $.when().then() - but it doesn't work either.
[10:23:08] <Cork> nisseni: if you have a selector from before the elements are replaces you can't use it; you have to make a new one
[10:23:29] <Cork> the jquery selector returns a result it isn't dynamically updated
[11:32:31] <mikky77> ola
[11:37:36] <mikky77> zany here
[13:39:07] <z1haze_work> i have a question about a delegated event listener.. for this example: $(el).on('click mouseover', '#thumbnails .thumb a.thumbnail-linkX', function (e) { ... does #thumbnails assume that its inside of el? or will it find the first one on the page even if its not inside of el
[13:42:41] <shoky> z1haze_work: that adds an event listener to el, that listens for events from its own children elements that match that full selector. so if the event happens on an element that is not a descendant of el, it will bubble up to el, and wont trigger your listener
[13:42:54] <shoky> it WONT bubble up to el, i meant to say
[13:44:49] <z1haze_work> ok cool, so if i have multiple components, and each fire this event listener, they shouldnt mix up
[13:47:57] <z1haze_work> i have an issue here: http://dpaste.com/3ACAK0G where this event is firing hundreds of times while the mouse has entered the element
[13:48:03] <z1haze_work> shouldnt it only fire once?
[13:48:14] <z1haze_work> i've tried mouseover and mouseenter
[14:16:44] <chrisml> anyone know if you can give blueimp file upload a url for a file? instead of file input
[14:46:17] <hellyeah> yo
[15:19:44] <momomo>  I adding a touchstart, touchend event listenr ... on touchend .. it has to be the same as touchstart ... but the problem is that event.target will return even nested childelemetns of that element  ... how can I make sure that touchend, actually releases on that same elemetn ? do I really have to recursively look on parent elements ?
[15:21:18] <momomo> touchend is triggered even when you are outside of that element if touchstart there
[17:08:07] <paulvd> hello
[17:12:34] <arc_> https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.cws9l3cjt
[17:32:29] <deecee> arc_: awesome. also educational.
[19:07:41] <TECFALL> I have created an array of id's using .map(). I now want to use that array as a value in my object -> var obj = { ids : myArray }; How can i accomplish this?
[19:08:17] <andrew9183> that should just work ?
[19:11:23] <ISmithers> I have a script (http://hastebin.com/favocaruva.php) that sets up Slick.js carousels and moves the previous/next slide buttons via jQuery to a container I specify with a CSS class. The problem I have is that when there are multiple carousels on a page, every carousel has their prev/next slide buttons dumped in to one container, rather than their respective containers.
[19:11:36] <ISmithers> Any ideas how I can track the particular instance I am working on?
[19:12:38] <andrew9183> you can assign them an id, and use the slick api to control them
[19:13:28] <andrew9183> see nextArrow, prevArrow
[19:14:34] <ISmithers> Can you elaborate a little andrew9183? I'm not sure I follow what you are saying. I already use nextArrow/prevArrow as you can see in my paste.
[19:15:07] <andrew9183> assign them to a specific node with an id selector
[19:15:33] <andrew9183> when id=“carousel-1-next”
[19:16:52] <ISmithers> I think I understand.
[19:16:57] <ISmithers> Let me give it a whirl, thanks.
[19:37:50] <ISmithers> Just in case anyone was interested I went this route http://hastebin.com/ladakaquru.php which works. Thanks for the pointer andrew9183, if not what you suggested it at least pointed me in the right direction. :)
[19:39:45] <ISmithers> (Added an extension method and then called it per instance basically which achieves the same result)
[20:18:07] <ISmithers> Does anyone know why multiple instances of this function do not run the window resize code at the bottom http://hastebin.com/asuritobig.php
[20:19:00] <ISmithers> Example, I call this twice on two different sets of elements. If I add a breakpoint in to the window resize function, it only gets hit by one instance when I resize the window.
[20:38:30] <ISmithers> Has anyone here used jQuery Duotone before? http://fabricelejeune.github.io/jquery-duotone/
[20:39:28] <ISmithers> I'm attempting to use it on some images however it is triggering an error regarding Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy, saying it the images cannot be loaded from blob.core.windows.net due to it.
[20:41:30] <arc_> where is the script running and where are the images hosted
[20:42:03] <arc_> sorry, where is the site that contains the script running
[20:42:12] <arc_> the script is obviously running in the browser on your machine
[20:42:27] <ISmithers> arc_: It is running on localhost atm, and the images are hosted on MS Azure blob storage.
[20:43:05] <arc_> ok. well you can't use javascript to modify something loaded from an external resource. try saving the image to your pc
[20:43:46] <ISmithers> So if I wish to use this plugin those images will need to be included as assets in the web project, when deployed to the server arc?
[20:43:50] <arc_> yes
[20:44:03] <ISmithers> *sigh* OK thanks for clearing that up. :)
[20:50:59] <ISmithers> Isn't this setting a crossOrigin policy arc_ http://hastebin.com/coledoquno.js This is from the source of DuoTone. Looks like that is from the HTML spec https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image
[20:52:43] <arc_> ISmithers the cross origin policy can only be changed on the server hosting the resource you are accessing
[20:52:56] <arc_> so unless you have control of microsoft's servers, i think you will have to download the images :)
[20:53:28] <ISmithers> I can't really download them because they are pulled from a CMS, uploadable by users. I just wish to style them is all.
[20:53:55] <ISmithers> I might be able to adjust some settings on the web server. But I doubt its worth the effort.
[20:55:27] <arc_> well if you have control of the azure account hosting the images you may be able to configure it https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-api-cors-consume-javascript/
[20:56:20] <ISmithers> Oh, nice find. Thanks arc_ I will give that a whirl as I do indeed have access to it.
[20:56:22] <arc_> but just be careful with this as it is a huge security hole if you don't configure it properly
[20:56:36] <arc_> depending on what you are actually hosting there
[20:57:16] <ISmithers> It is all image/video data. None of which is confidential but yes, worth being mindful
[21:23:49] <okeesss> hey i'm putting user id in jtoken, can I trust that that ID is correct so i can database query based on that?
[23:01:30] <Saint_Isidore> Anyone ever use jquery easy tabs?
