[00:56:21] <Braden`> Hello!
[00:57:19] <Braden`> What am I doing wrong?  Why am I getting errors?    	$('.grid-item').click({showContainer(); blah();});
[01:21:09] <pavonia> .click(function () {...}), I think
[01:23:38] <Braden`> Yep, that is what fixed it
[01:23:40] <Braden`> Thank you
[02:07:36] <Doodl> Need some help with this --> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44886641/disable-checkboxes-that-will-appear-empty-when-filtering
[02:50:13] <abb4s> hey every body , i want to send ajax request with post type , but it send get instead of post , I search it but i cant solve , where is the problem  ?  i use jquery 1.11 . my code : https://paste.ubuntu.com/25016649/ . thank you in advance
[02:54:13] <Cork> abb4s: make sure the server doesn't make a redirect on your post
[02:55:14] <abb4s> Cork:  i test sending request by postman(rest client program) , it response correctly
[02:55:33] <Cork> abb4s: check in the browsers network developer tools tab
[02:55:42] <Cork> if you see post > get
[02:55:52] <Cork> check the response from the server for the post
[02:56:01] <Cork> it is most likely giving you a 303 or similar
[02:56:53] <abb4s> Cork: it give 405 Method Not Allowed
[02:57:09] <Cork> does it give a location header?
[02:57:40] <abb4s> Cork: no
[02:58:02] <Cork> then i don't get how you can get a get request
[02:59:04] <EugenA> how can I get the data source of jquery UI autocomplete?
[02:59:06] <Cork> abb4s: anyway the server says you can't do post to that url so
[02:59:13] <abb4s> so it is not about redirecting request
[02:59:38] <Cork> EugenA: give a callback to the source property instead of a string
[02:59:52] <Cork> then you can do the ajax call and do what ever you want with it
[02:59:54] <abb4s> Cork: no , it say you cant send GET request , but jquery ajax send GET instead of POST
[03:00:04] <Cork> EugenA: if you use a _layout method you are given it there too
[03:00:15] <Cork> abb4s: check earlier in the network tab
[03:00:31] <Cork> you should see a post request there with a 3xx response
[03:02:24] <abb4s> what is 3xx ??
[03:04:11] <EugenA> Cork: I don't understand, can you give me an example?
[03:05:56] <Cork> abb4s: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302
[03:06:23] <Cork> EugenA: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem
[03:06:45] <Cork> "item" is the object in the response matching to that item
[03:11:33] <abb4s> Cork: i remove this line " dataType: 'jsonp' " and it send post request , but  i get cross-origin error ! :|
[03:11:42] <Cork> ah
[03:11:47] <Cork> i didn't even notice the jsonp
[03:11:53] <abb4s> what ?
[03:11:53] <Cork> abb4s: jsonp can't use post
[03:12:00] <Cork> it can't use anything other then get
[03:12:16] <Cork> abb4s: jsonp uses <script src="the url"></script> to load the content
[03:12:25] <Cork> so by definition it can only be get
[03:13:13] <abb4s> i dont know that , i just want to solve the cross-origin and add it code
[03:13:57] <Cork> abb4s: if you want to make cross origin data transmission use post + cors, or get and jsonp
[03:14:06] <EugenA> my autocomplete data is id:val. ID is stored in the field. On page load I need to take the id, search in autocomplete data and show the value in span-Tag
[03:14:10] <Cork> you can't do cross origin post without cors
[03:14:25] <abb4s> what is cors ?
[03:14:53] <Cork> Cross Origin Resource Sharing
[03:15:13] <Cork> its a header the server can send to a OPTIONS request to allow another domain to do posts to it
[03:15:39] <Cork> abb4s: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests
[03:17:47] <Cork> EugenA: sounds like this is what you want http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select
[03:17:55] <Cork> the second argument .item
[03:18:26] <Cork> it contains all the properties the json response from the source url contains
[03:21:27] <Al_nz1> I am learning jquery and the dev tools in chrome. When I send the result of a selector to console there is a lof of information - how do I know if my selector actually matched something against all that informaiton that comes back?
[03:41:25] <Cork> Al_nz1: console.log($('selector').length)
[03:47:57] <Al_nz1> Cork: yeah what I am doing is wrong
[03:48:19] <Al_nz1> Cork: https://pastebin.com/uCXpieSW both prev and closest find nothing
[03:48:57] <Cork> Al_nz1: .closest doesn't work like that
[03:49:17] <Cork> Al_nz1: http://api.jquery.com/closest/#closest1
[03:49:29] <Cork> it looks for parents not sibling children
[03:50:14] <Cork> what you want is $(this).closest('.input-group').find('input')
[03:50:42] <Cork> or just $('#nid0')
[03:53:02] <Al_nz1> Cork: What about selecting the panel-body line 6 https://pastebin.com/J7NE9s51
[03:53:25] <Al_nz1> $(this).closest('.panel-body')
[03:55:24] <Cork> sure
[03:55:36] <Cork> as long as it is a parent you can select it with .closest
[03:58:44] <Al_nz1> Cork: doesnt work : var $theForm = $(this).closest('.panel-body');
[03:58:57] <Al_nz1> $theForm.length is undefined
[03:59:03] <Cork> undefined?
[03:59:07] <Cork> it should never be undefnined
[03:59:10] <Cork> *undefined
[03:59:21] <Cork> so $ isn't jquery then
[04:00:11] <Al_nz1> what do you mean $ isnt jquery?
[04:00:53] <Al_nz1> $theForm is defined anywhere else
[04:01:22] <Cork> Al_nz1: not sure what you have there, but $theForm isn't a jquery instance
[04:01:37] <Cork> cause length is NEVER undefined in jquery
[04:02:52] <Al_nz1> Cork: I found the type
[04:02:55] <Al_nz1> typo
[04:03:24] <Al_nz1> shoudl be this console.log($theForm.length); not console.log($theForm).length
[04:03:34] <Al_nz1> never the less I am getting length 0
[04:03:35] <Cork> no
[04:03:51] <Cork> from $(this).closest() you get a jquery object
[04:03:54] <Cork> you don't need $()
[04:04:20] <Al_nz1> dont need $() where?
[04:04:25] <Cork> if you need $() it means, again $theForm isn't jquery
[04:04:37] <Cork> console.log($theForm).length) <--
[04:05:07] <Cork> if you do console.log(typeof($theForm))
[04:05:09] <Cork> what do you get then=
[04:05:10] <Al_nz1> Cork: I am trying to impliment something robertmaxrees showed me : https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pLrorvxt/3/
[04:05:11] <Cork> *?
[04:05:57] <Cork> ya, there $theForm is jquery
[04:06:16] <Al_nz1> I get object for typeof
[04:06:49] <Cork> Al_nz1: https://jsfiddle.net/pLrorvxt/4/
[04:06:52] <Al_nz1> what do you mean there it is jquery? mine is the same?
[04:07:00] <Cork> so check what you do differently to that fiddle
[04:07:16] <Cork> Al_nz1: not sure what you have, but it is different
[04:07:55] <Al_nz1> what should typeof have returned if I was doing it correctly?
[04:08:16] <Al_nz1> Cork: of course my html is different.
[04:08:30] <Cork> object, but .length would not be undefined
[04:09:03] <Al_nz1> Cork: its not undefined now
[04:09:16] <Al_nz1> now that I have the .length in the right place
[04:09:17] <Cork> ya, after you wrapped it in jquery -_-'
[04:09:34] <Cork> it doesn't help, cause it means the code that created it is wrong
[04:09:55] <Al_nz1> after I wrapped what in jquery?
[04:10:13] <Cork> console.log($theForm).length) <--
[04:10:23] <Cork> i've already answered that three times
[04:10:42] <Cork> if you need to do $($theForm) you are having a problem with creating $theForm
[04:11:02] <Al_nz1> I am not doing $($theForm)
[04:11:19] <Cork> and $theForm.length is not undefined?
[04:11:24] <Al_nz1> console.log($theForm.length) prints a number
[04:11:38] <Cork> ok, then you know the selector works
[04:11:43] <Al_nz1> yip
[04:11:54] <Al_nz1> the problem is the number is 0 -_-
[04:11:58] <Al_nz1> :(
[04:12:24] <Cork> Al_nz1: can you make a jsfiddle with the code you run and the html you're working with?
[04:12:53] <Al_nz1> I can tyr
[04:12:54] <Al_nz1> try
[04:15:49] <Al_nz1> Cork: I think I have the selector at least working now
[04:22:29] <Al_nz1> Cork: so if I now want to set a value like so : $theForm.find('input[name="surname"]').val(result.surname +'1');
[04:22:48] <Al_nz1> does the input have to be a immediate child of panel-body?
[04:23:02] <Cork> no, but it needs to be a child
[04:23:09] <Al_nz1> hmm, ok,
[04:23:19] <Cork> .children() checks for immediate children
[04:23:27] <Cork> (same syntax as .find())
[04:23:30] <Al_nz1> Im not sure its finding it
[04:23:47] <Al_nz1> I threw the +1 just to be able to see when it changes
[04:25:54] <Al_nz1> how can I debug from here
[04:26:19] <Cork> same as you did the last time you wanted to check a selector
[04:27:14] <Al_nz1> but $theForm isnt available in console
[04:27:28] <Al_nz1> and how do I use $(this) in console
[04:27:29] <Cork> so select the same element
[04:27:35] <Cork> you can't
[04:27:45] <Cork> this is just a dom element reference
[04:28:04] <Al_nz1> when you say select the same element you mean with a select statement
[04:28:15] <Cork> yes
[04:29:33] <Al_nz1> ok, and if $('.panel-body') returns multiple panel bodies how do I select say index 2?
[04:35:24] <Doodl> need help with this one --> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44886641/disable-checkboxes-that-will-appear-empty-when-filtering
[04:36:21] <Cork> Al_nz1: .eq(1)
[04:37:11] <Al_nz1> Yeah I used :eq(n)
[04:40:37] <Al_nz1> I select the top panelbody just fine : https://pastebin.com/4CaRijYK but then $theForm.find('input[name="surname"]').val(result.surname +'1'); does nothing - testing in console here
[04:40:57] <Al_nz1> even $theForm.find('input[name="surname"]').val("Hello");
[04:41:02] <Al_nz1> doesnt work
[04:41:19] <Cork> like i said before test the selector with .length
[04:41:26] <Cork> so remove the .val and see what the selector gives you
[04:47:07] <Al_nz1> nothing
[04:47:11] <Al_nz1> I get nothing
[04:47:57] <Al_nz1> $theForm.find('input') find heaps of course
[04:48:15] <Al_nz1> $theForm.find('input[name="surname"]') gets nothing
[04:48:34] <Cork> provide the jsfiddle i asked for
[04:49:08] <Al_nz1> So I can just cutn paste a bunch of html? do I need to cut n paste with matching tags?
[04:49:39] <Cork> yes, but you just need the relevant elements for the code you're working with
[04:50:30] <Al_nz1> I need to be able to make this fiddle expire? or not save?
[04:50:45] <Cork> you can't
[04:50:59] <Cork> so replace text content that is sensitive
[04:53:29] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/Lh9t45a6/
[04:54:36] <Cork> Al_nz1: https://jsfiddle.net/Lh9t45a6/1/
[04:58:40] <Al_nz1> yeah well something is different because that dont work this end
[05:02:43] <Al_nz1> how can that be?
[05:13:20] <Al_nz1> Cork: screen share??
[05:13:37] <Al_nz1> this jquery stuff is begining to drive me nuts
[05:39:24] <EugenA> I want to trigger select on autocomplete element
[05:39:41] <EugenA> $("#elem").data('autocomplete')._trigger('select', 'autocompleteselect', {item:{value:181187}});
[05:40:37] <EugenA> it doesn't work. Can be the problem in "{item:{value:181187}}" ?
[05:41:14] <Cork> EugenA: that only triggers the event that autocomplete generates
[05:41:36] <Cork> is that what you really want to emulate?
[05:42:06] <Cork> also note it WON'T trigger $().autocomplete({ select: function() {})
[05:42:29] <Cork> only $().autocomplete().bind('autocompleteselect', function() {})
[05:43:48] <EugenA> how can I trigger $().autocomplete({ select: function() {}) ?
[05:44:02] <Cork> as far as i remember, you can't
[05:49:46] <Cork> EugenA: ah, hmm try $("#elem").data('autocomplete')._trigger('select', new $.Event('menuselect'), {item:{value:181187}})
[05:50:08] <Cork> the one might work, no guarantees though
[05:57:54] <EugenA> https://jsfiddle.net/q98nmvvn/
[05:58:39] <EugenA> on page load want to see "lab2" text and 120150 in input
[05:58:55] <Cork> ah, right the format of _trigger is wrong
[05:59:34] <Cork> hmm, no its not...
[06:00:20] <Cork> EugenA: https://jsfiddle.net/q98nmvvn/2/
[06:01:05] <EugenA> hm, but the label should come from data
[06:01:44] <EugenA> the problem is: if the page loads I have only the ID and I need to tosplay the corresponding label for this id
[06:08:12] <Cork> EugenA: then you need to call the search method
[06:08:26] <Cork> cause before that autocomplete doesn't have it either
[06:11:03] <EugenA> this? 120150
[06:11:07] <EugenA> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-search
[06:11:30] <Cork> yes
[06:12:20] <Cork> EugenA: you might find http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox interesting
[06:16:24] <EugenA> https://jsfiddle.net/q98nmvvn/3/
[06:16:58] <EugenA> I need put right label near the input field
[06:17:41] <EugenA> https://jsfiddle.net/q98nmvvn/4/
[06:18:41] <EugenA> can I get the right label from data without looping the array?
[06:37:25] <Cork> EugenA: https://jsfiddle.net/q98nmvvn/6/ something like that is prob the best i can think of at least
[06:37:32] <Cork> then you can trigger the click on the first element
[06:37:53] <Cork> search searches for the label, not the value so that might be problematic
[06:38:09] <Cork> anyway afk
[07:35:17] <Doodl> how to change language on pages?
[08:12:06] <Dro> hello, if I have a function defined inside a jQuery(function($) { } in a .js and I want to invoke it from another file.js, how can I do please?
[08:20:13] <Cork> Dro: you can do window.functionName = functionName;
[08:20:24] <Cork> that makes the function javascript global
[08:20:36] <Cork> Dro: alternatively you can just define it outside $(function() {})
[09:37:40] <Amnesia> question, is it a known error that IE 11 returns "SCRIPT1002: Syntax error" for Jquery 3.2.1 ?
[10:18:37] <Cork> Amnesia: not that i know no
[10:18:53] <Cork> Amnesia: what line is it referring to?
[10:27:40] <Neo_3333__> hi guys
[10:27:55] <Neo_3333__> I hi
[10:28:10] <Neo_3333__> hi
[10:29:01] <Neo_3333> hi
[10:29:06] <Neo_3333> hi
[10:29:18] <Neo_3333> I need make search all element in javascript
[10:29:43] <Neo_3333> get all elements with class 'driver' , how possible I do it ?
[10:30:14] <Neo_3333> without jQuery
[10:30:16] <Cork> Neo_3333: http://learn.jquery.com/
[10:30:23] <Neo_3333> on jQuery I know how
[10:30:50] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll
[10:31:08] <Neo_3333> I did it on jQuery, just I can't use there jQuery , it included in bottom and I mast include this code above it
[10:31:09] <Cork> ^ that is what jquery uses underneath
[10:31:36] <Neo_3333> underneath
[10:32:38] <Neo_3333> it's my code https://hastebin.com/idikosibev.js
[10:32:49] <Cork> read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll
[10:32:57] <Neo_3333> and need it redo without jQuery
[10:33:00] <Neo_3333> ok
[10:35:04] <Neo_3333> I did it elementList = document.querySelectorAll('driver'); instead $('.driver') , and how replace 'each' ???
[10:35:11] <Neo_3333> this is loop
[10:39:15] <FilipNortic_> Neo_3333: document.getElementByClassName("driver") returns an array just loop it with a for-loop
[10:39:53] <FilipNortic_> that said this is the jQuery chat if you wanna use plain js join the javascript room
[10:42:27] <ajf-> can I intercept a form submit that's already being handled and sends a request to an address (by an external library)? I want to know if that request fails or not and place a callback
[10:44:43] <FilipNortic_> ajf-: are you using ajax to submit the form?
[10:45:30] <ajf-> it uses ajax yes
[10:45:33] <ajf-> currently
[10:47:19] <FilipNortic_> then just place a new request in the callback to the old
[10:50:01] <ajf-> i said it's being handled by an external library
[10:50:14] <ajf-> i didn't make that ajax behavior i just want to intercept it
[10:52:19] <FilipNortic_> ajf-: ahh well i think you can bind an ajaxComplete to body
[10:54:21] <FilipNortic_> ajaxComplete(function( event, xhr, settings ) , this will trigger for all ajax-requests but you should be able to filter on setings.url to get the ones you want
[10:55:56] <FilipNortic_> ajf-:  ohh, ajaxComplete has to be bound to document not body
[11:02:07] <ajf-> ah great
[11:02:13] <ajf-> thanks
[11:10:51] <Neo_3333> I use this $(this).find('.block_driver #first_name'+index).val()
[11:11:03] <Neo_3333> to find element inside block div
[11:11:44] <Neo_3333> when I use it document.querySelectorAll('div.driver'); , how I can get that element ?
[11:12:18] <Neo_3333> does existing similar function find in clean javascript ?
[11:12:22] <FilipNortic_> wekk it's wired to search for a class and an id
[11:12:27] <FilipNortic_> well*
[11:12:59] <FilipNortic_>  there shoudl only be one element with the id #firstname_+index
[11:13:24] <Neo_3333> not weird, just inside that block data is generated and there unknown amount items
[11:14:18] <FilipNortic_> yeah but the class just be unneccerary if you have an id on the element
[11:14:50] <Neo_3333> no there before was many elements with the same id, just in jQuery when I use this code $('#firstname').each ... I got only one element and I need for other actions use unique id
[11:15:03] <FilipNortic_> that's worng
[11:15:09] <Neo_3333> why ?
[11:15:31] <Neo_3333> and you can offer better way if you have dynamically generated data inside ?
[11:15:34] <FilipNortic_> the standard is that only 1 elment in the page have the same id
[11:15:43] <ajf-> looks like ajaxComplete is only for jQuery-triggered ajax calls FilipNortic_. I don't have guarantee that the external library will be using jQuery
[11:16:24] <Neo_3333> yes it have only one element , in first block drivesrs all id have 1 in end and next blocks have 2 ... till n
[11:17:08] <Neo_3333> jQuery good lib, but without it I can't do something :(
[11:17:21] <FilipNortic_> then $(this).find('.block_driver #first_name'+index)=$('#first_name'+index)
[11:17:41] <Neo_3333> yes
[11:17:59] <FilipNortic_> and you can use getElementById to get that element
[11:18:05] <Neo_3333> but I can't do it explicitly because it's dymamic data
[11:18:28] <Neo_3333> FilipNortic_ in endless loop ?
[11:18:55] <Neo_3333> FilipNortic_ , how I can check when element not exist ?
[11:19:14] <FilipNortic_> getElementById will be null
[11:19:55] <FilipNortic_> and if they have the same class you can select on classname or somthing first and get the length of the array
[11:20:41] <Neo_3333> do loop , while(flag==true){getElementById('ours_id'); if(!getElementByid('ours_id')){flag=false;} }
[11:20:47] <Neo_3333> something like that use ?
[11:21:11] <Neo_3333> ok, now to try , do it
[11:21:38] <Neo_3333> I like use 'each' instead ....
[11:22:36] <Neo_3333> than I don't need this document.querySelectorAll('div.driver'); , will use instantly id
[11:27:11] <FilipNortic_> ajf-: I have litte to non expirance with non jQuery ajax so I can't help you with that
[11:34:44] <Neo_3333> perfectly work
[11:35:44] <Neo_3333> FilipNortic_, clean javascript also not bad , similar jQuery , need learn syntax
[11:36:26] <Neo_3333> I got headache now , it's javascript guilty , up take pill now :)
[11:37:36] <Neo_3333> ok, make break , continue little later
[14:46:00] <sopparus> is it generally a bad idea to write out js with php?
[14:47:25] <tracker1> sopparus, better to JSON encode an object structure that you output for use with JS
[14:48:12] <tracker1> how to do that in PHP, not sure, I know there's classes/objects now, but every time I've used PHP my eyes start to bleed after a while.

[15:33:10] <rjCousineau> Hello. I have <input type="text" name="query" value=""> .. on submit I want to send that data with another object.   so $.extend( dataObj, $(this).serializeArray() ) is making { name: 'query', value: '' } not... { query: '' } .. i'm suprised..  if I just use serialize() i get {'q', 'u', 'e', 'r', 'y', '=', '\'', '\''}

[16:15:53] <engaged> I am using jquery-ui datepicker but my custom CSS is overriding the jquery-ui css. Is there a way to stop that? Some of mine is !important on some items so that might be doing it. But is there anyways to specify to use jquery-ui css for this div no matter what?
