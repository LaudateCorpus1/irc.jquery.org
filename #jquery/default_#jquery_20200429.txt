[08:49:10] <Jasein> There are several methods of jquery that return values instead of jquery objects, but they all seem to only return the value applied by the first element in the collection.
[08:49:36] <Jasein> how can I get something similar but return an associative array of values?
[08:50:10] <Jasein> I can't seem to figure out how to get a reference key for my array.
[09:05:37] <Jasein> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/QWjMKbB?editors=1111 works but not well.
[09:08:15] <Cork> Jasein: $.map($(), function(e) { return $(e).method() })
[09:08:28] <Cork> that way you get an array of all the values from the different elements
[09:16:48] <Jasein> Thanks for the reply,  I realized that what I was really trying to do was get the total area of all the elements like this https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/QWjMKbB?editors=1111
[09:16:53] <Jasein> though it is not working. lol
[09:26:40] <Jasein> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/QWjMKbB?editors=1111   got it finally
[09:45:32] <Jasein> inside the $.fn.getBounds function "this" is the jquery object. If there are more than one elements in the jquery object, wouldn't the first item be this.eq(0)? and it's element would be this.eq(0)[0]?
[10:00:17] <Jasein> in elem.getBoundingClientRect() returns a DOMRect object that contains a toJSON function. How can I add a toCSS function that would return css properties?
[10:34:41] <Jasein> I don't get this. I set rect.right=right then i log (rect.right, right) and rect.right is not the same as right...?

[10:35:07] <Jasein> line 20
[13:03:44] <robertparkerx> in examples I found they used .tab() but I try it and it says that the function cannot be found
[13:03:59] <robertparkerx> the only resources they're using is boostrap and jquery
[13:23:25] <shoky_> robertparkerx: it's not a jquery method. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navs/#via-javascript
[13:23:34] <robertparkerx> I found that too
[13:23:36] <robertparkerx> Sorry
[13:23:44] <robertparkerx> I can't call it and it is enqueue
[13:23:58] <shoky_> hm?
[13:25:06] <dw1> "Tab should have either a data-target or an href targeting a container node in the DOM"
[13:25:34] <dw1> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[13:26:26] <dw1> maybe you need popper too
[13:26:36] <robertparkerx> I tried
[13:26:43] * taplar heard poppers were illegal
[13:28:20] <dw1> ( à²  ÍœÊ– à² )
[13:28:36] <dw1> or nav-tabs class
[13:29:45] <robertparkerx> I'm going to try to compile with the bundle
[13:40:03] <robertparkerx> I don't know. I try to enqueue directly from the CDN on the documentation and get the same error
[13:43:07] <dw1> what are you calling it on
[13:43:14] <dw1> an individual tab
[13:43:18] <dw1> within a nav-tabs
[13:43:46] <dw1> with role="tab"
[13:43:48] <dw1> etc
[13:47:10] <robertparkerx> No a link but I am trying to use the hash to ('show') tab
[13:47:26] <robertparkerx> the tabs work by themselves
[13:47:32] <robertparkerx> and they're using bootstrap nav
[13:47:36] <robertparkerx> so makes no sense
[14:00:09] <dw1> yea works for me
[14:00:12] <dw1> post your code
[14:03:14] <dw1> i dont even use role=tab or anything
[14:03:18] <dw1> just nav-pills in the container
[14:03:22] <dw1> nav nav-pills
[14:03:30] <dw1> then some nav-item links
[14:03:34] <dw1> which i bind to
[14:04:58] <dw1> well li.nav-item a.nav-link
[14:06:56] <robertparkerx> http://nordgen.dev-mild-rp.mildmedia-dev.eu/calendar-events/nordgen-skogs-arliga-konferens/#anmalan dw1
[14:07:29] <dw1> requires login. codepen.io or jsfiddle.net is customary
[14:08:03] <dw1> show the prob at the most basic level
[14:08:20] <robertparkerx> It will likely work when I create a test case
[14:08:24] <dw1> lel
[14:08:33] <robertparkerx> I'm just being honest
[14:43:15] <robertparkerx> I figured it out
[14:43:27] <robertparkerx> It had something to do with the compile
[14:43:56] <robertparkerx> I import Bootstrap from 'boostrap'
[14:44:02] <robertparkerx> and the error went away
[15:07:04] <robertparkerx> Thank you everyone who helped
[18:00:51] <kittonian> dw1, you around?
[18:01:08] <dw1> no
[18:01:12] <kittonian> lol, ok
[18:01:19] <dw1> ( à²  ÍœÊ– à² )
[18:01:31] <kittonian> do you have a few moments to help me with another custom validation?
[18:01:51] <kittonian> everything you already helped with works perfectly, but of course a user already screwed something up and I need another one
[18:02:38] <dw1> what is it
[18:03:08] <kittonian> ok, so remember those 9 images we validated against with the post_image1_title, etc.?
[18:03:38] <dw1> yup
[18:03:44] <kittonian> there is a post_main textarea where the user types in their article, along with relevant html tags from various buttons I've created
[18:03:49] <kittonian> what I need to do is
[18:03:51] <kittonian> if post_image1_title exists then <dtml-var “blog.sitefiles.post.postimg1(_.None, _)"> line must exist within the post_main textarea
[18:04:02] <kittonian> if post_image1_title does not exist then <dtml-var "blog.sitefiles.post.postimg1(_.None, _)"> must not exist within the post_main textarea
[18:04:11] <kittonian> if post_image1_delete is true (or rather the select option value=’t’) then <dtml-var "blog.sitefiles.post.postimg1(_.None, _)"> must not exist within the post_main textarea
[18:04:17] <kittonian> that's it
[18:04:48] <kittonian> it has to somehow check for that text string in the textarea
[18:05:05] <dw1> javascript
[18:05:16] <dw1> value.indexOf('string')!==-1
[18:05:42] <dw1> means it exists
[18:06:00] <kittonian> ok, but how can we make a custom validator to check for all of this, across all 9 post images individually?
[18:11:57] <dw1> to avoid duplicating code youd prob have to use an attribute to sync related fields
[18:12:10] <dw1> data-id="image1" on all the fields or whatever
[18:12:23] <dw1> idk
[18:12:34] <dw1> make a pen
[18:12:48] <dw1> could maybe just do it with the id
[18:13:27] <dw1> hmm
[18:14:01] <dw1> i guess you just duplicated code last time
[18:14:06] <dw1> 9 validators for 9 images
[18:19:56] <dw1> anyway it will be similar to the last image stuff
[18:20:04] <dw1> just with .indexOf('string')!==-1
[18:20:18] <dw1> you should figure it out
[18:20:42] <dw1> or ===-1 if you want it not found
[18:20:46] <dw1> instead of found
[18:23:42] <kittonian> I setup a codepen for you https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/gOaxvzy
[18:24:41] <kittonian> i also left your previous validation code in there to use as a reference
[19:54:57] <dw1> did you get it kittonian
[20:26:43] <kittonian> dw1, I sort of got some of it working. https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/gOaxvzy
[20:32:39] <kittonian> brb, have to walk the dog
[20:50:45] <dw1> pretty sure you can get the last one but check this https://codepen.io/dw1/pen/WNQEJbz
[20:50:50] <dw1> i found a way to do dynamic error messages
[20:57:04] <dw1> unfortuntaely it seems parsley doesnt pass the id or object being worked on so there may not be a shortcut to avoid duplicating code for multiple similar inputs
[20:57:32] <dw1> it's not in the 'this' object either
[20:58:35] <dw1> you could avoid duplicate code by escaping to PHP and generating the javascript there though
[20:58:50] <dw1> :/
[21:01:01] <dw1> actually i think it might be in the 3rd argument passed to the validator
[21:04:35] <kittonian> back
[21:06:07] <kittonian> unfortunately php is not an option due to the application server
[21:06:09] <dw1> actually that doesnt really help all you need is a loop
[21:06:24] <dw1> and dynamic error messages
[21:07:02] <dw1> just loop 1-9 doing the check for each one
[21:07:05] <dw1> or whatever
[21:07:41] <kittonian> how would that work?
[21:08:44] <kittonian> are you thinking that because the title field is post_image#_title and the code it's checking for has postimg# in it, the # could be [] and it would match the number?
[21:11:08] <dw1> no just if you had image1 through image9 fields you could just do a for loop
[21:11:23] <dw1> for(let i=1;i<=9;i++){ // checks }
[21:11:41] <dw1> and use i for selecting the fields and and throwing custom errors
[21:11:59] <dw1> and*
[21:16:19] <dw1> youd just have to remove the top else if and replace it with the for loop and anywhere you see 9 replace it with '+i+'
[21:16:25] <dw1> get it
[21:16:39] <dw1> well put the if in the loop without else
[21:18:06] <kittonian> they aren't named that way due to a bunch of other database queries and application server statements
[21:18:36] <kittonian> the only way it would work is if we could replace where I put the # in my example with a number and see if both numbers match
[21:19:03] <kittonian> so if post_image[]_title matches postimg[]
[21:19:21] <dw1> https://codepen.io/dw1/pen/qBOXYxN
[21:19:29] <dw1> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[21:20:13] <kittonian> do you still need the first if statement?
[21:21:00] <dw1> you could probably replace the first if in all examples with just return true below the false returns
[21:21:09] <dw1> :)
[21:21:31] <kittonian> i mean if (value.indexOf('<dtml-var "blog.sitefiles.post.postimg9(_.None, _)">') !== -1 &&
[21:21:34] <kittonian> that one
[21:21:43] <kittonian> wouldn't that go away?
[21:21:54] <dw1> you would want to return true when there are no falses
[21:22:05] <dw1> if you put that at the bottom then yes
[21:22:20] <dw1> oh yeah i guess itw ould
[21:22:27] <dw1> because it's specific
[21:22:38] <dw1> either way
[21:22:47] <dw1> just put return true at the bottom
[21:22:49] <dw1> and remove it
[21:23:11] <dw1> i updated my pen
[21:23:48] <dw1> ..again
[21:24:26] <dw1> ..again
[21:24:29] <dw1> :P
[21:24:56] <kittonian> like this https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/gOaxvzy
[21:25:32] <dw1> yeah but put return true after the for loop
[21:25:37] <dw1> in case there are no falses
[21:27:10] <kittonian> gotcha. however, when you get the error and do something in the post_main textarea the field validates, but if you get the error and do something in the post_image9_title input field the error doesn't resolve
[21:29:11] <dw1> yeah
[21:29:57] <dw1> how did we fix it the first time
[21:30:19] <kittonian> you want me to post all your solutions in my codepend?
[21:30:22] <kittonian> *codepen?
[21:30:25] <dw1> lol no
[21:30:35] <kittonian> thought it might be good reference
[21:30:41] <kittonian> i don't mind
[21:30:42] <dw1> i have them
[21:30:45] <kittonian> oh ok
[21:31:34] <dw1> just need a validator on the image field that triggers a change in the post_main i guess
[21:31:42] <dw1> so it revalidates
[21:31:53] <kittonian> ok
[21:31:53] <dw1> title field
[21:31:58] <kittonian> i know what you meant
[21:32:11] <dw1> maybe $('#post_main').trigger('change');
[21:32:12] <dw1> idk
[21:32:32] <dw1> or you could put a change event on the field
[21:32:42] <dw1> trigger it from there
[21:32:44] <dw1> maybe
[21:32:58] <dw1> or .change();
[21:34:03] <kittonian> it's not just as simple as putting data-parsley-code-img on the title field is it?
[21:34:16] <dw1> no
[21:34:24] <dw1> any errors thrown from there will show under the image title
[21:34:26] <dw1> not the post main
[21:34:31] <kittonian> right
[21:34:52] <kittonian> well, we kind of want that to don't we?
[21:34:53] <dw1> and value searches would be different
[21:35:11] <kittonian> if the code exists in post_main but there is no title, don't we want the error to be under the title field?
[21:36:03] <dw1> idk do you
[21:36:12] <kittonian> it would probably be more helpful
[21:36:44] <kittonian> in that case, the user did the right thing in the textarea but forgot to include the image
[21:37:09] <kittonian> we're already validating the image fields (title, credit, alt, description) against the input file for the image
[21:37:15] <kittonian> so those should already be taken care of
[21:38:09] <kittonian> or did the wrong thing in the textarea because there isn't supposed to be an image
[21:38:23] <kittonian> hmm, maybe you're right. maybe it should be just under the post_main textarea
[21:38:38] <kittonian> or maybe both?
[21:43:20] <kittonian> can we make it do both?
[21:44:30] <kittonian> the form is so large and there are large sections for all the fields for each image, that it could get confusing if it was image7 and the user was looking for which field they forgot
[21:49:31] <kittonian> here's how you made it listen with the series stuff
[21:49:32] <kittonian> $('#series_post').change(()=>{
[21:49:40] <kittonian>  if(!validating) return; $("#createpost").parsley().validate({group:'sn'});
[21:49:47] <kittonian> });
[22:03:36] <kittonian> dw1, still with me?
[22:15:01] <kittonian> dw1, I fixed it https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/gOaxvzy
[22:25:41] <dw1> â”—(-_-)â”›
[22:26:50] <dw1> can prob use a css wildcard to bind all of em
[22:26:59] <dw1> $('#post_img*_title')
[22:27:37] <dw1> maybe https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wildcard-selectors-and-in-css-for-classes/
[22:27:57] <dw1> maybe not
[22:28:47] <dw1> ah https://stackoverflow.com/a/6874731
[22:29:34] <dw1> $('input[id^="post_img"][id$="_title"]')
[22:29:44] <dw1> or just throw a class on
[22:31:59] <kittonian> just tried it out on the real site and it doesn't work
[22:32:24] <kittonian> it only validates the 1st problem with the image vs the code and even when that is resolved it doesn't move on to the next image vs code problem
[22:33:57] <dw1> maybe because of what this guy talks about https://stackoverflow.com/a/44310863
[22:36:47] <kittonian> nope. i missed a piece of code I needed. now it works
[22:36:54] <dw1> oh good
[22:37:29] <kittonian> still need to deal with the other part of the equation regarding the delete select
[22:37:47] <dw1> thats easy :p
[23:14:17] <kittonian> dw1, perhaps tomorrow you can help me get that working. for now I got the rest of it all working for the most part. You wouldn't believe the amount of code in this page. It's really quite crazy. Have a good night.
[23:14:45] <dw1> its just one more else if similar ot others
[23:14:47] <dw1> gn
