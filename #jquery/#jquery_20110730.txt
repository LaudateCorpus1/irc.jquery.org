[00:00:04] <Cork[home]> rpcesar: what would they build the event on then?
[00:00:07] <rpcesar> basically, i have a "class" on the public namespace called "search", it does not have an actual dom representation, but I want it to shoot out events for new search results, and new individual response.
[00:00:36] <Cork[home]> ah, faked events
[00:00:46] <rpcesar> yes
[00:00:50] <gnarf> you can bind events to plain js objects
[00:01:03] <gnarf> behavior is afaik undocumented
[00:01:08] <gnarf> but it works
[00:01:26] <rpcesar> I remember reading it somewhere, but I can't find the docs now :/ lol, its why I came to ask, see if someone could point me to some of the specifics
[00:01:40] <gnarf> rpcesar: its the same as any other event
[00:02:00] <gnarf> $( obj ).bind("eventname", callback).trigger("eventname")
[00:02:01] <rpcesar> yea, the idea is I wouldent mind having something like $(search).bind("select",function(){}); // a search result was selected
[00:02:21] <gnarf> ?trigger
[00:02:22] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[00:02:22] <gnarf> ?bind
[00:02:23] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[00:02:39] <SinnerNyx> is there some way to make jquery show an element that was initially hidden via display:none in it's css?
[00:02:42] <rpcesar> yea, I have read the docs on all of those, I wanted to make sure what I was doing was "ok"
[00:02:48] <gnarf> ?show @SinnerNyx
[00:02:49] <bot-t> SinnerNyx, .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[00:02:58] <rpcesar> I do remember them making some change to the event system to ALLOW it IIRC
[00:03:08] <gnarf> SinnerNyx: might be easier to remove the class hiding it tho
[00:03:19] <rpcesar> but I wasnt sure if I could use my own object, or if they meant i had to trigger off of document
[00:03:25] <gnarf> rpcesar: i've been using that since like 1.4
[00:03:57] <rpcesar> gnarf, do you know if its possible to build fake events, with the same name as regular events, triggered from a custom javascript object?
[00:03:57] <SinnerNyx> gnarf: good idea. :) thx
[00:04:25] <rpcesar> the reason being is simply that I hate using "silly" names to avoid namespace-like confilcts
[00:04:30] <gnarf> ?tias @rpcesar
[00:04:31] <bot-t> rpcesar, Try It And See
[00:04:40] <gnarf> jsfiddle
[00:04:44] <gnarf> you could know the answer and tell me

[00:07:28] <gnarf> rpcesar: it adds a property to the obj tho
[00:07:38] <gnarf> so be careful if you plan to for...in or $.each it
[00:09:15] <rpcesar> im a bit confused, looking at the console in your fiddler. why are you recommending in or $.eaching it?
[00:09:43] <rpcesar> you mean in order to trigger from within the objects scope I would have to go $(this).trigger("search") right?
[00:11:40] <gnarf> no
[00:12:13] <gnarf> ?js var o = {}; $( o ).bind("test", $.noop); o
[00:12:14] <bot-t> gnarf: {"jQuery1312009932374": 1}
[00:12:27] <gnarf> note that it adds a property to the object
[00:12:36] <gnarf> so be careful if you $.each( o )
[00:13:02] <rpcesar> you mean the jquery "stamp"?
[00:13:07] <rpcesar> ohhh
[00:13:09] <gnarf> expando
[00:13:12] <gnarf> yeah
[00:13:21] <leP> sigh its not working Cork[home] im brb eat

[00:13:39] <Cork[home]> leP: the popup blocker might break it for you
[00:13:49] <leP> na i disabled it
[00:14:07] <leP> if it was pop up blocker, the windows wouldn't have opened in the first place
[00:14:07] <rpcesar> isnt that bad form to be iterating through an object like that anyways?
[00:14:07] <leP> anyway
[00:14:16] <gnarf> rpcesar: depends on the object
[00:14:26] <rpcesar> the only time I use $.each() is when going over an array, or a selector
[00:14:38] <gnarf> rpcesar: imagine a hash table
[00:14:41] <rpcesar> yes
[00:15:03] <gnarf> you can each it, but if you bind an event on it, it will suddenly have a jQuery.expando prop
[00:15:06] <rpcesar> I guess I did not realize that $.each would even work with an object in that degree, I always assumed if it did, it would pick up all sorts of javascript junk as well
[00:15:25] <rpcesar> yea, I wont be eaching the search, its a "static" namespace
[00:15:39] <Cork[home]> leP: its sleasy but it work http://jsbin.com/anawun/3
[00:15:40] <gnarf> ?js $.each({ a: 1, b: 2 }, function( i, v ) { console.log ( i , "is", v); });
[00:15:40] <bot-t> gnarf: "a" "is" 1"b" "is" 2{"a": 1, "b": 2}
[00:16:04] <gnarf> ?pubsub
[00:16:04] <bot-t> jQuery publish/subscribe plugin by Peter Higgins http://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js
[00:16:31] <gnarf> ?g rmurphey pubsub
[00:16:32] <bot-t> gnarf, Pubsub Screencast - rmurphey - http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/pubsub-screencast
[00:16:33] <rpcesar> im not allowed to use any plugins prefixed by the word "bloody".
[00:16:54] <rpcesar> :)
[00:16:57] <gnarf> ^^^ rpcesar interesting app concept you might want to look at
[00:17:33] <rpcesar> actually I wrote something VERY similar
[00:17:37] <gnarf> might be more of what you're looking to do
[00:17:38] <rpcesar> for jsonp
[00:17:52] <gnarf> publish that a search happend
[00:17:55] <gnarf> anything can listen
[00:17:56] <rpcesar> slightly more specific.
[00:18:24] <rpcesar> well, whats the benifit of that versus $(search).someevent() // bind
[00:18:32] <rpcesar> it seems pretty much the same to me
[00:18:45] <gnarf> rpcesar: it avoids a lot of overhead event creation / bubbling issues
[00:19:14] <gnarf> rpcesar: watch the screencast
[00:19:22] <gnarf> rmurphey does a pretty good job of explainin it
[00:19:26] <rpcesar> I wrote THIS (http://pastebin.com/buPJ1KpU) the other day
[00:19:41] <rpcesar> itI think it does the same thing essentially
[00:19:44] <gnarf> an empty paste?
[00:19:52] * gnarf grins
[00:19:55] <rpcesar> eh, hangon a second
[00:20:01] <rpcesar> 2 computers
[00:20:03] <rpcesar> code was on one
[00:20:08] <rpcesar> was trying to hand code the link
[00:20:16] <rpcesar> http://pastebin.com/bUPJ1KpU
[00:20:33] <rpcesar> ignore the idiotic comments
[00:20:53] <gnarf> yeah, except pubsub is like 10 lines of code
[00:20:58] <rpcesar> lol
[00:21:22] <leP> Cork[home] what do you mean is that my script?
[00:21:53] <leP> Cork[home] like because it should continuesly open window
[00:22:10] <gnarf> (function(a){var b={};a.publish=function(c,e){b[c]&&a.each(b[c],function(){this.apply(a,e||[])})},a.subscribe=function(a,c){b[a]||(b[a]=[]),b[a].push(c);return[a,c]},a.unsubscribe=function(c){var e=c[0];b[e]&&a.each(b[e],function(a){this==c[1]&&b[e].splice(a,1)})}})(jQuery)
[00:22:14] <gnarf> ^^^ pubsub
[00:22:18] <gnarf> you could almost tweet that
[00:22:18] <rpcesar> gnarf: the code I wrote does a bit more, it binds to any jsonp service provider, and makes it searchable.
[00:22:43] <rpcesar> i was using it to create dynamic meshups from blogger.com
[00:22:56] <gnarf> ?csb
[00:22:56] <bot-t> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[00:22:59] <gnarf> :)
[00:23:14] <rpcesar> that just made my day
[00:23:20] <leP> Cork[home] please put my name before you comment, i'm brb
[00:24:21] <gnarf> ?hi5 @rpcesar
[00:24:22] <bot-t> rpcesar, ‚Åµ
[00:25:27] <Cork[home]> leP: all you need to do is replace the w with your array
[00:25:44] <Cork[home]> leP: its just a consept to show what you need to do
[00:25:53] <leP> Cork[home] w ?
[00:25:57] <Cork[home]> ya
[00:26:15] <gnarf> leP: what are you even tryin to do? :)
[00:26:16] <Cork[home]> leP: my suspision is that your calling closeWindow, before its actually loaded
[00:26:28] <leP> Cork[home] hmm
[00:26:45] <leP> where can i get the snippet of yours?
[00:26:56] <Cork[home]> leP: in the url i gave
[00:27:15] <leP> http://jsbin.com/anawun/3/ ?
[00:27:19] <Cork[home]> gnarf: load a shitload of popups, and check if the pages has a specific content, and close it
[00:27:25] <Cork[home]> leP: yes
[00:27:36] * gnarf sighs
[00:27:40] <Cork[home]> ya
[00:27:41] <leP> ok ill be away for like an half n hour ill be back
[00:27:43] <leP> thank you cork
[00:27:48] <Cork[home]> np
[00:28:05] <rpcesar> so whats the main "perk" of using this versus events? is it that much faster? etc.
[00:28:10] <gnarf> i don't see many legitimate uses for that idea
[00:28:47] <Cork[home]> gnarf: me neather, but its not really a problem, he would hit REALLY hard into any popup blocker anyway
[00:28:51] <gnarf> rpcesar: its way simpler, and handles a lot of coolness - you don't need all the overhead of events
[00:29:00] <gnarf> if you need something events gives you
[00:29:05] <gnarf> then by all means use it
[00:29:09] <rpcesar> your right, I probably don't
[00:29:26] <gnarf> pubsub is just like "global event"
[00:29:34] <gnarf> without all the event overhead
[00:29:46] <gnarf> or "application event"
[00:29:56] <rpcesar> I am just a little worried about the scope, im having problems wrapping my head around those 30 lines of code atm :/
[00:30:11] <gnarf> watch the screencast? :)
[00:30:14] <rpcesar> i like to play with scope... a lot... i do nasty things with it... things you would not do with your drunk girlfriend
[00:31:15] <rpcesar> I am not a big fan of apply for anything other then establishing scope, passing them as parameters bothers me, I prefer passing complete objects.
[00:31:57] <rpcesar> big fan of jquery's use of 1 argument (single object) then multiple arguments.
[00:32:51] <rpcesar> namely because it lets me "extend" objects, handlers, etc so nicely. im worried about what I may lose using this pubsub, but it sounds brilliant outside of that (more applicable anyways)
[00:33:08] <gnarf> rpcesar: you build all those objects anyway
[00:33:11] <gnarf> rpcesar: use them
[00:33:48] <gnarf> rpcesar: just have one $.publish("searchComplete", data) and the other $.subscribe("searchComplete", function( data ) {});
[00:34:25] <gnarf> again, screencast is >informative<
[00:34:27] <gnarf> :)
[00:38:16] <gnarf> she talks about it literally in the scope of a "search" object :)
[00:38:26] <gnarf> which is why you made me think of it
[00:38:33] <rpcesar> I don't see the link?
[00:38:41] <gnarf> ?g rmurphey pubsub
[00:38:41] <bot-t> gnarf, Pubsub Screencast - rmurphey - http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/pubsub-screencast
[00:38:44] <gnarf> click HD on
[00:38:46] <gnarf> watch
[00:40:19] <rpcesar> going to watch it now, want to make a quick point though, because I want to make sure I can do what I want. the reason I was considering using the event model has to actually do with a very specific feature set. yes, I have multiple things listening to the listings. a google map meshup, a grid, and a sideview list of objects. but its more then just "listening" to them. there were other "events" as well. for instance, when one object is
[00:40:27] <rpcesar> listeners would then call their "selected" event
[00:40:47] <rpcesar> ie: when a user clicks on an object on the map, it would select it in the grid, and the list
[00:40:58] <rpcesar> if something was deleted from the view, its deleted from all of them
[00:45:41] <rpcesar> gnarf: many thanks for the link btw
[00:47:07] <gnarf> rpcesar: its just an interesting approach to app design
[00:47:28] <gnarf> rpcesar: your way might work better in your setup, but pubsub is soooo tiny ;)
[00:48:01] <rpcesar> it looks good... not sure if it will work well with the promises I am using, ill have to play around.
[00:48:24] <gnarf> promises and pubsub work great together
[00:48:31] <gnarf> :)
[00:48:37] <gnarf> you can publish promises
[00:48:52] <rpcesar> tell that to my girlfriend
[00:49:43] <rpcesar> alright, im going to take your advice and try this, it looks fancy.
[00:49:47] <gnarf> heh
[00:49:59] <gnarf> i think its worth at least an hour experiment
[00:50:02] <gnarf> its a good concept
[00:50:37] <gnarf> i should get back to Mask tho
[00:51:05] <gnarf> ?glwt @rpcesar
[00:51:05] <bot-t> rpcesar, Good Luck With That
[00:51:18] <rpcesar> thanks gnaf. btw, the "mask" is a gay bar about 10 min from where I live
[00:51:23] <gnarf> awesome
[00:51:32] <rpcesar> go ?glut @gnarf :)
[00:51:37] * gnarf puts on his skirt
[00:51:40] <rpcesar> *so
[00:51:42] <rpcesar> lol, later mate
[00:51:43] * gnarf dances
[00:52:08] <gnarf> sadly, http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137996/Mask not quite as fun as the gay bar
[00:52:51] <rpcesar> oh shit gnarf, I wrote something to do just that a few weeks back, if you need code.
[00:53:06] <gnarf> rpcesar: I need it as a UI plugin
[00:53:07] <gnarf> :)
[00:53:14] <gnarf> there are two examples on there already
[00:53:16] <rpcesar> its pretty dynamic...
[00:53:21] <rpcesar> ok
[00:53:31] <gnarf> if you wouldn't mind a quick review of them
[00:53:47] <gnarf> and lemme know what to look at on yours
[00:53:54] <gnarf> i might pillage chunks :)
[00:53:58] <rpcesar> I have not done any jqueryui plugins, but I am using it on exclusively jquery ui projects.
[00:54:18] <gnarf> well in 1.9 you might be able to just use .mask() :)
[00:54:19] <rpcesar> yea, outside of the fact I always namespace my code, its not bad
[00:54:29] <rpcesar> i know that irritates everyone but me
[00:54:43] <rpcesar> mind shooting me an email gnarf?
[00:54:45] <gnarf> i drop my own hangers onto $ too
[00:54:55] <rpcesar> rpcesar AT gmail dot com
[00:54:57] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37
[00:55:47] <rpcesar> alright, im not in the office where that code is repo'd, but i'll shoot you it when I get there.
[00:56:04] <rpcesar> do with it as you will, its isolated, but not a plugin by any means.
[00:56:15] <gnarf> yeah
[00:56:22] <gnarf> examples of way people solved it are useful
[00:56:45] <gnarf> I'm just struggling with organization atm
[00:56:48] <rpcesar> you are aware of the new HTML features right?
[00:56:50] <rpcesar> HTML5
[00:56:55] <rpcesar> and how it "falls back"
[00:56:57] <gnarf> most of them
[00:57:03] <rpcesar> well there are fields for most of these
[00:57:11] <rpcesar> that fall back to text
[00:57:29] <rpcesar> but on html5 compliant browsers they provide added features as well (fields like email, phone number, etc)
[00:57:50] <rpcesar> I generally used these modified types.
[00:57:58] <rpcesar> which is auto detected.
[00:58:46] <rpcesar> mirrored as a class dynamically (which is typically unstyled). additional classes can be added to tag in a number of ways
[00:59:30] <gnarf> yeah
[00:59:56] <gnarf> just working on the custom inputs widgets for grid
[01:00:02] <rpcesar> but the system in general runs off of regex
[01:00:04] <gnarf> i'm gonna rebuilding a few of em
[01:00:17] <rpcesar> you give it a regex, and it creates a binder for it.
[01:00:32] <sprezzatura> was wondering whether there is any nice plugin which displays an uploaded xls file in a an editable table.
[01:01:00] <gnarf> sprezzatura: not directly - you'll prolly be parsing that using something server side
[01:01:01] <aaairc_> what would you guys recommend on how to temporarily make a div unclickable while an animation is executing?
[01:01:08] <gnarf> sprezzatura: but
[01:01:13] <gnarf> sprezzatura: docs.google.com
[01:01:17] <gnarf> does a pretty decent job
[01:01:18] <gnarf> :)
[01:01:44] <rpcesar> <aaairc_> I would simply handle it in the click event itself.
[01:02:04] <sprezzatura> gnarf: is there some licensiing issues with it? i mean, can i do it for propritary s/w?
[01:02:16] <sprezzatura> also, what if the uploading user does not have a goog account
[01:02:16] <rpcesar> don't think of it as "make it unclickable" (you cant REALLY do that after all), think of it as "if the animations running, don't process the normal click"
[01:02:19] <gnarf> aaairc_: if ( ! $(this).is(":animated") ) { }
[01:02:57] <rpcesar> and in the time i wrote that speech, gnarf turned it into code. way to one up me.
[01:03:03] <gnarf> sprezzatura: sorry man, your like asking something way more complicated to answer than anyone here probably could
[01:03:11] <gnarf> at least in the time you have to listen
[01:03:25] <sprezzatura> ah!
[01:03:47] <gnarf> sprezzatura: i doubt there is a "plugin" to do it
[01:04:00] <aaairc_> rpcesar: thanks for the suggestion
[01:04:02] <gnarf> thats like a whole web app
[01:04:03] <sprezzatura> not a problem
[01:04:03] <rpcesar> i have a lawyer and a rabbi tied up in my closet. i'll ask one of them for you later.
[01:04:14] <aaairc_> gnarf: its actually a css animation using the transition property so don't think i can do that
[01:04:18] <gnarf> you might want to look at some of the "grid" plugins tho
[01:04:24] <gnarf> they could get you started down the right path
[01:04:25] <rpcesar> oh
[01:04:27] <rpcesar> one thing
[01:04:34] <sprezzatura> gnarf: jqgrid looks promising
[01:04:40] <rpcesar> whats the best grid plugin you know of gnarf? sortable columns in particular. no editing.
[01:04:50] <sprezzatura> rpcesar: jqgrid
[01:04:54] <sprezzatura> http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html
[01:04:54] <rpcesar> preferably, the minimal amount of extras, but easiest to expand
[01:05:02] <gnarf> rpcesar: never needed one
[01:05:12] <gnarf> ?grid
[01:05:21] <gnarf> ?g ui grid
[01:05:41] <rpcesar> well one of the search "subscribers" is currently a table that injects into the tbody.

[01:06:42] <gnarf> there it is
[01:06:50] <rpcesar> gah, seems like a lot of work to move that over... i forget what I am using now, but those are too "featured" of grids.
[01:06:57] <rpcesar> I don't want excel
[01:07:13] <rpcesar> I just want a table that features sorting, ive wrote a few myself, but trying to tie myself into less of my own code
[01:07:43] <rpcesar> my new philosophy is "do less, think less, less mess"
[01:09:54] <leP> Cork[home] why exactly did set console.log?
[01:10:32] <rpcesar> so has anyone tried webstorm lately? my new favorite ide i think.
[01:10:56] <rpcesar> mind boggling well designed feature set

[01:25:39] <steaksauce> anyone working on any cool js websites?
[01:26:28] <dr0id> nope
[01:59:30] <madprops> how can I make this layout be always 100%, stick to the bottom and not beyond so no scrollbars are needed? http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZLj7x.gif
[02:29:47] <RikudoSennin> how can I change a <select>'s selection with jquery?
[02:42:07] <Kalyan> Hi, Can anyone direct me to a solution to make find() case insensitive?
[02:45:38] <Haprog> Kalyan: what find() function are you talking about?
[02:48:22] <Kalyan> I was using find() to find elements of a particular tagname  in a document
[02:48:55] <Haprog> you mean the jQuery find() that takes a selector? what does it have to do with case-sensitivity?
[02:50:59] <Kalyan> i was trying to search for some custom tags , but if the case of tagname (selector) is not correct, it is not giving any results
[02:52:32] <Haprog> ok, then I don't know how to help. but why are you using custom tags/elements?
[02:54:46] <Kalyan> we have a requirement where the users can specify some SVG files, add some custom tags to some elements in the SVG and we should be able to find them out and do some processing on those elements
[02:57:41] <Haprog> why not just require all tags to be lowercase? :P
[02:58:13] <na3r> hi, is there any jquery plugin to separate amount number? i mean 20,000
[02:58:36] <na3r> something like http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin
[02:59:03] <na3r> but i separats from left. i wanna separate from left
[02:59:22] <na3r> but it separats
[02:59:56] <RikudoSennin> can anyone help me with jquery ui?
[03:00:17] <RikudoSennin> I've downloaded it, linked to it and to the stylesheet, but when I use .datepicker() the datepicker widget has no styling at ll
[03:00:40] <RikudoSennin> when I check it with Chrome's debugger, the stylesheet is included, but not applied for some reason
[03:00:54] <RikudoSennin> can anyone help me figure this one out?
[03:09:11] <gnarf> RikudoSennin: got a link?
[03:09:20] <RikudoSennin> local
[03:09:23] <RikudoSennin> but I managed, thanks
[03:09:28] <RikudoSennin> forgot I had to set the PHP headers :D
[03:09:36] <gnarf> for?
[03:09:54] <RikudoSennin> all my CSS files have a PHP handler enabled for them
[03:10:15] <gnarf> thats a lot of extra processing that isn't neccesarily needed
[03:10:30] <RikudoSennin> it allows me to use custom functions like <?php box_shadow("1px", "2px", "1px"); ?>
[03:11:03] <RikudoSennin> gnarf: I know I can use style.php instead of style.css but it's ugly, and it's a small app, so I don't really care about these micro optimizations :)
[03:11:05] <gnarf> RikudoSennin: you really should have a build/deploy that executes that code and saves it as pure .css
[03:11:18] <gnarf> fair nuff
[03:11:27] <gnarf> but as far as the UI css goes
[03:11:29] <gnarf> its a css file
[03:11:35] <gnarf> just use the css file :)
[03:11:41] <RikudoSennin> yes, it is a css file
[03:11:54] <RikudoSennin> I only needed to add header("content-type: text/css");
[03:12:06] * gnarf sighs
[03:12:07] <RikudoSennin> ;)
[03:12:21] <RikudoSennin> now another questio
[03:12:28] <RikudoSennin> slightly less stupid and more complicated
[03:12:35] <RikudoSennin> I have the jquery ui datepicker
[03:12:42] * gnarf raises an eyebrow
[03:13:01] <RikudoSennin> I want to disable certain DAYS OF THE WEEK, meaning, only Mondays and Wednesdays (for example) are enabled for selection
[03:13:30] <gnarf> RikudoSennin: you can do that
[03:13:35] <gnarf> ?ui datepicker
[03:13:37] <bot-t> gnarf, jQuery UI - Datepicker Demos & Documentation - Date: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[03:13:55] <RikudoSennin> I searched for that, nothing in there to help :)
[03:14:12] <gnarf> look in "beforeShowDay" event
[03:14:24] <RikudoSennin> I can set the range, and not allow before/after a certain date, but I can't change specific days
[03:14:24] <gnarf> The function takes a date as a parameter and must return an array with [0] equal to true/false indicating whether or not this date is selectable, [1] equal to a CSS class name(s) or '' for the default presentation, and [2] an optional popup tooltip for this date. It is called for each day in the datepicker before it is displayed.
[03:15:11] <RikudoSennin> aha
[03:15:13] <RikudoSennin> very nice
[03:15:17] <RikudoSennin> will try, thanks :D
[03:15:29] <gnarf> np
[03:15:49] * gnarf kinda hates datepicker
[03:15:56] <gnarf> api is so ugly now
[03:19:05] <RikudoSennin> gnarf: you can change the styling however you'd like you know
[03:19:43] <gnarf> RikudoSennin: I'm talking from a code design standpoint, not CSS
[03:20:08] <RikudoSennin> oh
[03:20:13] <gnarf> so many options
[03:20:17] <gnarf> its kinda gross
[03:20:20] <gnarf> :)
[03:21:02] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, is it possible to find a word from a paragraph?
[03:21:24] <gnarf> Paveloosha: of course, however, what do you want to do with it?

[04:21:17] <ShawnRisk>  hi
[04:21:27] <asfahaan> Can someone please help me fix the jquery slider on this website. http://www.arabesquetrove.co.nz/
[04:21:33] <asfahaan> don't know whats wrong with it.
[04:22:15] <asfahaan> it is based on a purchased theme: http://www.themesnap.com/theme-demos/shoppica/
[04:30:56] <GDmac> Any tip on how i can get the filesize for an image on the page?
[04:31:42] <GDmac> i'm generating 5 different versions of an image with PHP and would like to put/write the filesize on the page
[04:32:58] <Haprog> GDmac: http://php.net/manual/en/function.filesize.php
[04:34:19] <GDmac> i'm generating the images with image.php?quality=100 and image.php?quality=80 etc. and can't return filesize() with the image
[04:34:49] <GDmac> Is there no way to get the content.length from the document.images or something?
[04:37:12] <Haprog> You aren't saving the generated images as files for caching? WOuld be quite pointless to waste resources by generating the same images on every pageload.
[04:38:46] <GDmac> yes, i know. Currently i'm in a testing phase where i just want to determine the filesize for different qualities and possible filters.
[04:39:34] <GDmac> firebug and chrome developtools have info on the filesize. But probably hooked  into the net layer of the browser
[04:39:40] <Haprog> I guess you could load the same image url "image.php?quality=100" etc. with an ajax call and check the length of the returned data.
[04:40:22] <Haprog> it would make sense for image.php to implement it's on caching though
[04:40:27] <Haprog> *own
[04:41:10] <GDmac> I think it's actually a bit silly that such basic info is not available in document.images
[04:43:14] <Haprog> GDmac: there seems to be fileSize property for image elements, but I think it's IE only.
[04:46:04] <ShawnRisk> how do I add a class to each function that allows me only to select the font code within the class? ¬†Along with this, how do I fix the normalFontSize() code to make this go back to the original font size? ¬†Code: http://pastebin.com/fMyjTnWS
[04:48:42] <jesteracer> hello, can anyone help with jcrop? The problem is with loading it with load(), it works ok for the 1-st time, then it multiplies%)
[04:50:40] <GDmac> ok, found a work-around. Calling image.php?quality=90 for the image and again with &getsize to just get the strlen() of the buffer. Still think there should be an easy way to get content.length directly on the image

[06:36:37] <Chib> hasDatepicker
[06:36:41] <Chib> is breaking it
[06:38:16] <sprezzatura> Chib: hasDatepicker is dynamically inserted by jquery , as i need a datepicker for that component
[06:38:33] <sprezzatura> see $('input[name$="reading_date"]').datepicker(  ?
[06:38:50] <Chib> it's not dynamically entered in the code you linked

I have a CMS I want to create some templates for, but would like to rely on making things as easy as possible without getting so many graphics involved, something as easy as enabling a plugin
[07:26:19] <tomasm-> also, are there different varieties of styling available to Jquery UI tabs?
[07:29:35] <sprezzatura> given an array like this : data =[[1500,4500], [100,300], [1000,200], [100,400]] , how do i calc the max value?
[07:31:08] <nail_> well, first, how do you define the max value?
[07:32:58] <sprezzatura> well, in this just the numerical value that is higest.
[07:33:13] <sprezzatura> basically max value in a  mutlidimensional array
[07:33:31] <nail_> but between [1,2] and [2,1], what's the max? :)
[07:33:39] <sprezzatura> so some kind of flattening of the arrays and the max value.
[07:33:57] <sprezzatura> well, flatten the array and then find the max value. so how do i flatten the multi dimensional array
[07:35:32] <sprezzatura> for that how do i calculate the dimensions of the array? for example in my example : 2 and 4.
[07:35:48] <sprezzatura> 4 elements(arrays) each having 2 elements
[07:43:18] <sprezzatura> sigh! why is this generating an error for me : int[] newArray = new int[mysize];

[08:21:15] <mzo> good ol opera
[08:21:35] <savage-> hey guys, question‚Ä¶. I'm fairly new to javascript, but wondering if it's possible to start out with a beginner's book to jquery and skip a full book on just javascript to get started?
[08:21:39] <mkoell> opera users have a much more IQ than IE users!^^
[08:22:12] <mzo> savage: depends on how well you learn by immersion ;)
[08:22:22] <mzo> I'd recommend having google or a javascript reference book handy
[08:22:28] <kenthree> you can probably skip the full book, but understanding how jquery achieves what it does helps
[08:22:40] <Peter`> I'd firmly recommend learning JavaScript prior to learning jQuery
[08:22:53] <Peter`> There already are too much job offers asking for "jQuery programmers"
[08:23:02] <mzo> true true
[08:23:17] <fris> jquery isnt a language
[08:23:24] <mzo> it can't hurt to start with jquery to give you fun stuff to do right away in js tho
[08:23:25] <savage-> cool. is there a good free/online tutorial that you would recommend before jumping into jquery?
[08:24:08] <fris> savage- http://tutorialzine.com and http://tympanus.net/codrops/
[08:25:22] <savage-> thanks!
[08:25:22] <mkoell> Ok, my problem: I'm using Dirk Ginader's AccessibleTabs Plugin. All works perfect. But I want to sort some elements before i'm using the plugin. So the DOM changes and I have to use the .live() function. I'm trigger a custom event called "invert" when done with my changes. After that, the plugin doesn'T work anymore! http://pastebin.com/HQqb5kwb
[08:26:24] <kenthree> I'm looking for advice on implementing something like this http://i.imgur.com/U0fan.png , not technical details but the logic.. specifically what would I do when a user unticks a checkbox?
[08:26:59] <savage-> I will go through this tutorial first: http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
[08:27:16] <kenthree> savage-: many people recommend NOT using w3schools
[08:27:27] <mzo> kenthree: something like $(selector).change() ?
[08:27:41] <mzo> not sure what you're asking
[08:28:23] <mzo> oh I see, you want some logic on the showing/hiding?
[08:28:29] <savage-> hmm
[08:28:29] <kenthree> mzo: yes
[08:28:51] <kenthree> specifically since it's a venn diagram situation where it depends on which ones are ticked
[08:29:04] <kenthree> i'm not very smart
[08:29:05] <mzo> hmmm
[08:29:06] <mkoell> hope you understand my question, else ask me^^
[08:30:14] <mzo> are those supposed to be radio buttons or a checkbox?
[08:30:18] <mzo> meaning can you select more than one?
[08:30:23] <mzo> they say show ONLY so its unclear
[08:30:24] <kenthree> savage-: http://w3fools.com/
[08:30:38] <savage-> found it!
[08:30:38] <savage-> http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[08:30:42] <savage-> I'll start with that.
[08:30:44] <savage-> thanks!
[08:30:46] <kenthree> mzo: yeah, if you tick yellow and big, it would show only those that are both yellow and big
[08:32:14] <mzo> ok here's what you could do
[08:32:33] <mzo> create class for yellow, big, small, etc
[08:32:36] <mzo> put them on the elements
[08:32:48] <kenthree> right..
[08:32:52] <mzo> and have them display: none; by default
[08:32:59] <mzo> then have a class called showElement or something
[08:33:07] <mzo> that has display: block; or whatever you want
[08:33:27] <mzo> then when a checkbox is change()'d use the checkboxes with jquery multiple selectors ( http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/ )
[08:33:37] <mzo> to select only the elements with all the matching classes
[08:33:41] <mzo> and add the showElement class
[08:33:50] <mzo> but before doing that make sure to remove showElement from all elements
[08:34:00] <mzo> thats one approach
[08:34:31] <mzo> not sure how well that'd work with the display overriding the display: none's
[08:34:42] <kenthree> so i'd use the multiple selector with each checked box's corresponding class?
[08:35:08] <SoftLight> Hello, can anyone tell why the select options for jQuery.dualListBox are not passed in POST ? I've added the : selectOnSubmit: true option in .configureBoxes ... the page is : http://www.autohunter.com.au/extra-options
[08:35:21] <mzo> on each checkbox set the Value attribute to the name of the class you want it to toggle
[08:35:34] <mzo> that way you can read that in for building the multiple selector
[08:36:00] <mzo> so whenever you get a change() event you can go through all the checkboxes and grab the val() of the ones that are checked
[08:36:12] <mzo> put it in an array or whatever and build the multiple selector from that
[08:37:00] <mzo> you might be able to get that array with a single jquery selector
[08:37:07] <kenthree> mzo: thanks, I dont know why but I was trying to keep the checkboxes independent of each other- turned out a little too complex
[08:37:17] <mzo> lol np
[08:37:17] <dabear> SoftLight: box1View does not have a name associated with it
[08:38:09] <SoftLight> dabear, should have the same name like box2View ?
[08:38:49] <dabear> SoftLight: two selects should not have the same name
[08:38:56] <dabear> no two items should have the same name
[08:39:03] <SoftLight> ok
[08:39:10] <SoftLight> I've put the names ... still nothing :(
[08:39:36] <SoftLight> after submit I've put an foreach ($_POST .... echo ... and I'm not getting anything
[08:41:16] <dabear> SoftLight: the first submit?
[08:41:30] <dabear> or after http://www.autohunter.com.au/payment/ is submitted?
[08:41:51] <SoftLight> dabear, the first one ... on the payment page you'll on top the results
[08:42:25] <SoftLight> something similar to carsid = {caris}, x = , y =
[08:42:35] <SoftLight> x & y for firefox
[08:44:11] <dabear> carsid = {carid}
[08:44:12] <dabear> radio =
[08:44:12] <dabear> x = 20
[08:44:12] <dabear> y = 16
[08:44:15] <dabear> is what I get
[08:44:29] <SoftLight> exactly
[08:44:30] <K1ng> any idea why $("#password #username") doesnt work?
[08:44:40] <SoftLight> this are the info that are passed on submit
[08:44:56] <SoftLight> as you can see no view1 or view2 ( for the multiple selectors )
[08:45:35] <SoftLight> K1ng, put $("#password, #username")
[08:46:06] <K1ng> yay its works
[08:46:09] <K1ng> thanks mate :)
[08:46:14] <SoftLight> np
[08:46:37] <dabear> SoftLight: oh, now I know what you mean. first, in php with select multiples, you have to use names ala view1[] in your html
[08:46:47] <dabear> so that php understands it's an array
[08:47:01] <SoftLight> so the name should be view1[] ?
[08:47:01] <dabear> second: you gotta highlight the select lists to actually send data
[08:47:04] <dabear> yep
[08:47:16] <SoftLight> how do I highlight it ?
[08:47:49] <dabear> eg., each option need to have selected=true in code
[08:48:16] <dabear> SoftLight: https://skitch.com/bjorninge/fcsmn/untitled-document
[08:48:47] <SoftLight> I see
[08:48:54] <SoftLight> just 1 moment to do the changes
[08:48:55] <SoftLight> :)
[08:49:30] <dabear> the better option there, is to create a series of hidden inputs before the submit
[08:49:48] <dabear> that contain the data from the select lists
[08:50:13] <SoftLight> yes, cos no one will stay to highlight before submitting
[08:51:21] <SoftLight> dabear, still
[08:51:34] <SoftLight> if you read gere
[08:51:36] <SoftLight> here
[08:51:36] <SoftLight> http://www.meadmiracle.com/dlb/DLBDocumentation.aspx
[08:51:38] <SoftLight> the page plugin
[08:51:49] <SoftLight> selectOnSubmit option should do that
[08:51:51] <SoftLight> right ?
[08:53:28] <kenthree> is .hide() on many elements slower than a css class? (without animation)
[08:57:48] <ShawnRisk> kenthree: from my experience hide is fast
[08:58:25] <ShawnRisk> kenthree: I would say hide in jquery is faster but never benchedmarked
[08:58:44] <dabear> SoftLight: remove selectOnSubmit: true
[08:58:52] <dabear> it should be the default anyway
[08:58:59] <jbrokc> is there an easy way with jquery to say parameter("foo")  and get it's value? if ?foo=bar then it should return "bar"
[08:59:16] <SoftLight> dabear, did that ...
[08:59:38] <SoftLight> I was thinking now to change from css the attr when the next button it's clicked
[08:59:43] <dabear> it's still there on line 79
[08:59:57] <SoftLight> forgot to upload :)
[09:00:00] <SoftLight> done
[09:00:22] <SoftLight> sorry ... to change from jquery
[09:00:33] <SoftLight> something like ... $("#subselect").click( function () {
[09:00:33] <SoftLight> 		$("select option").attr("selected", "selectedss");
[09:00:33] <SoftLight> 	});
[09:00:55] <dabear> SoftLight: carsid = {carid}
[09:00:55] <dabear> view1 = Array
[09:00:55] <dabear> view2 = Array
[09:00:55] <dabear> radio =
[09:00:55] <dabear> x = 44
[09:00:57] <dabear> y = 15
[09:01:01] <dabear> so works now
[09:01:24] <SoftLight> yes... I've put the jquery code for select
[09:01:24] <SoftLight> :D
[09:01:49] <SoftLight> dabear, thanks a lot for your help .. :)
[09:05:57] <kenthree> is there a shortcut for merging arrays without repeating values?
[09:09:34] <dabear> kenthree: yeah, it's called a loop
[09:09:47] <mzo> lol
[09:10:32] <dabear> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.merge/ merges
[09:10:37] <dabear> but does not remvoe duplicated
[09:10:38] <dabear> s
[09:11:33] <dabear> kenthree: you can use underscore.js and it's uniq features
[09:11:34] <dabear> http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#uniq
[09:12:01] <kenthree> thanks all, this will work though http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1584370/how-to-merge-two-arrays-in-javascript/1584377#1584377
[09:14:47] <slaeke> anyone around in here?
[09:15:14] <slaeke> I have a couple of questions I'm looking to get some help on regarding ajaxComplete()
[09:16:11] <tbranyen> ?ask
[09:16:25] <tbranyen> damnit bot-t is dead again
[09:17:22] <slaeke> heh
[09:17:27] <slaeke> so, here's the thing
[09:17:35] <slaeke> i have a site i'm building for a client
[09:17:44] <slaeke> that uses a real estate IDX solution
[09:18:18] <tbranyen> i have no idea what that means
[09:18:19] <tbranyen> but continue
[09:18:43] <slaeke> long story short, the page helps accomplish a listing search for houses
[09:19:07] <slaeke> when the page loads, some of the search fields are hard coded, but others are brought in with a prototype.js ajax request
[09:19:28] <slaeke> i need to adjust some of the attribute on the fields and want to use jquery
[09:19:35] <ajpiano> if your question is "can you use jQuery's ajaxComplete event to catch when the prototype.js request is complete" the answer is no
[09:19:43] <slaeke> ok i thought not...
[09:19:59] <slaeke> but, i'm wondering what I can use, since i've tried prototypes onComplete also, and that didnt work
[09:20:35] <ajpiano> you can use only one general purpose js lib in an app
[09:20:36] <ajpiano> :)
[09:22:03] <ajpiano> i mean, you can also use more than one, but the inevitable question is "Why?"
[09:22:26] <slaeke> haha
[09:22:59] <slaeke> the IDX solution uses multiselects in weird sizes...
[09:23:07] <slaeke> i'm just trying to make them dropdown menus....
[09:23:11] <slaeke> and i cant.....grrrr
[09:23:33] <ajpiano> slaeke seen this plugin http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[09:23:36] <ajpiano> ?
[09:23:53] <mkoell> dropdown's are nice, as long as they are accessible enough
[09:25:29] <slaeke> better than multiselects
[09:25:34] <slaeke> what does "chosen" do?
[09:25:37] <slaeke> forme?
[09:26:09] <ajpiano> transforms a multiselect into a dropdown and tokenises each individal entry, facebook style?
[09:26:21] <ajpiano> good thing you asked, it's not like there are demos on the page :...
[09:26:30] <ajpiano> :p
[09:26:43] <slaeke> meh
[09:26:50] <slaeke> talking to my mom, and getting mom aggro..
[09:26:59] <slaeke> so i cant go to that page right now...
[09:27:07] <ajpiano> ...
[09:27:08] <slaeke> bout to go to lucnh...care to give me a quick rundown?
[09:27:12] <ajpiano> are you serious
[09:27:14] <ajpiano> is this some kind of joke
[09:28:00] <slaeke> ok nvm then....sheesh...
[09:28:43] <ajpiano> sorry but in 3.5 years of doing support like this i have never given someone a link to exactly what they need for their project and then had to describe what it does to them because they can't visit the website because their "mom is aggro"
[09:29:16] <slaeke> lol fine
[09:30:26] <mkoell> aggro is so german like, or what does this word mean?
[09:31:18] <ajpiano> "aggressive"
[09:31:44] <ajpiano> slaeke i could post a screenshot of what it does but i suspect your mom is on some kind of "stay on irc as much as you want but don't visit any websites" kick
[09:32:00] <motaka2> Whats the problem with this one?  http://pastebin.com/5b5Dv8ai it says there is a missing ) i cant fine
[09:33:15] <slaeke> lol i checked it out, but it doesnt seem like it would work
[09:33:26] <slaeke> since the fields i need to change won't be there on initial page load
[09:33:43] <slaeke> so, the chosen plugin would fire and the fields wouldnt bet here
[09:34:36] <ajpiano> ah yes and as everyone knows it's impossible to initialize a ui widget like that at any poitn after the dom is ready
[09:35:11] <jbrokc> is there an easy way with jquery to say parameter("foo")  and get it's value? if ?foo=bar then it should return "bar"
[09:37:50] <slaeke> ajpiano, so i've used a plugin similar to this, called selectbox
[09:38:00] <slaeke> that works similar, and it doesn't work on these fields
[09:38:05] <slaeke> but i'll give it a shot.
[09:38:06] <slaeke> thanks
[09:40:29] <nym> heya
[09:40:49] <nym> ajpiano: ya going to summer camp?
[09:41:00] <ajpiano> hmm?
[09:41:00] <nym> not sure if you're into node.js :)
[09:41:08] <ajpiano> ohh nodecamp
[09:41:19] <ajpiano> i'm not going to nodecamp but i'm like into node
[09:41:20] <nym> http://www.nodeconf.com/summercamp.html
[09:41:25] <ajpiano> but not THAT into it
[09:41:32] <nym> heh
[09:41:32] <ajpiano> also i have like 4 weddings and a conf this fall
[09:41:38] <nym> which conf?
[09:41:57] <ajpiano> jqcon!
[09:42:02] <nym> woot
[09:42:32] <nym> hey, i adopted jq as part of the locker project http://lockerproject.org/
[09:42:38] <nym> and backbone
[09:42:59] <ajpiano> mm i love me some backbone
[09:43:05] <nym> i know rite
[09:43:18] <nym> have you played with spine?
[09:43:31] <nym> i've just read about it
[09:43:35] <ajpiano> i haven't
[09:43:38] <ajpiano> my view of spine is like
[09:43:50] <ajpiano> please describe to me why i need to save 2k
[09:43:54] <ajpiano> and only get most of the API
[09:43:58] <nym> ahahaha
[09:44:11] <ajpiano> OTOH we picked a spine talk for jqcon :p
[09:44:26] <tbranyen> neato
[09:44:33] <nym> is it still possible to get tix?
[09:44:42] <ajpiano> nym, eminently possible :)
[09:48:19] <TeamColtra_Cloud> Can someone help me with http://forum.jquery.com/topic/check-a-radio-button-based-on-drop-down
[09:50:27] <iivvoo> you know how to use if statements in javascript, right?
[09:50:34] <iivvoo> the code makes my head hurt
[09:51:06] <g0bl1n> if one previously escapes an URI, making an ajax call re-escapes the URI ? How to prevent this ?
[09:51:41] <g0bl1n> I'm escaping a part of the URI (that may contain slash's to %2f)
[09:58:49] <TeamColtra_Cloud> iivvoo: I honestly know 0 about javascript
[09:59:12] <TeamColtra_Cloud> I took the code from some website that did the first part of what I needed to do
[10:09:04] <g0bl1n> ok, encodeURIComponent solves this.
[10:23:48] <TeamColtra_Cloud> This toggle radio button issue is the last thing I need for my script to be ready.
[10:25:01] <fvox13> I'm trying to get access to objects in the parent of an iframe (fancybox). top.$('myselector') doesn't seem to work.
[10:56:24] <kenthree> where can I find the stuff stored with .data() in firebug?
[11:12:21] <aximilation> I wanted to get an opinion: I'm making an ajax call to a php file which returns a multidimensional array, what would be the preferred method of returning the data? I was thinking json or something like that
[11:13:08] <imsky> json is best
[11:13:14] <hrwath> +1
[11:13:40] <aximilation> alright, that's what I thought, I was originally going to serialize as I haven't done much with json thus far
[11:16:44] <systemfault> Using json is trivial. And json_encode/decode makes it dead simple to do in php
[11:16:58] <aximilation> yea that's what it looks like
[11:17:02] <imsky> json_decode($x,true); makes it even better
[11:17:17] <systemfault> decode?
[11:17:29] <systemfault> He wants to get json if I read correctly.
[11:17:45] <imsky> let's just have a json party
[11:17:56] <systemfault> I agree.
[11:18:55] <systemfault> It's saturday, saturday, gotta have a JSON party on saturday...
[11:19:23] <tomoyuki28jp> Is there any good plugin to show overlay contents?
[11:20:21] <imsky> wot
[11:29:57] * aximilation looks back up
[11:30:20] <aximilation> I was trying to figure out the best way to return data from php to jquery > json
[11:30:28] <aximilation> is what I used, looking good
[11:31:48] <systemfault> JSON is pretty much stringified javascript so.. it's most of the time the best.
[11:52:45] <madprops> does this make any sense? $(document).height($(window).height());
[11:53:44] <imsky> sure it does
[11:57:27] <kenthree> does  http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Position replace the default .position() ?
[11:58:14] <madprops> imsky, any idea why the document wont change height?
[11:58:32] <imsky> madprops: jsfiddle it
[11:58:57] <madprops> imsky, this is what im trying to achieve http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6882165/100-height-no-scrollbars
[11:59:34] <imsky> you can get that done without js
[12:02:29] <croby> it seems as though .html() is encoding the URLs in my href tags -- is there any way to avoid this?
[12:12:03] <Janto> Do you know of any projects that provide a functionality like an Asp.net masterpage, but using only jquery and js? ( the funcionality would let you have all site-wide stuff like header & footer in just 1 page, and let all other pages be pure content pages, which are loaded into the master page)
[12:14:41] <Janto> I know you can just have 1 main page and use.load() to load other pages into a div of the main page, but that prevents the url from changing when navigating
[12:14:53] <jbrokc> join #less
[12:16:40] <josePhoenix> Is the safari/webkit inspector not bound by same-origin policy?
[12:17:45] <josePhoenix> Hmm. Can't tell what's killing this ajax request
[12:23:00] <brianpWins> In chrome I can verify an ajax call is responding with json data but my method: http://pastie.org/2295660 prints out the pasted info which doesn't contain my json data?
[12:24:21] <smplstk_> ugh, brianpWins: that's not how you do it...
[12:24:57] <brianpWins> smplstk_: duly noted, have a link to how I should be doing it?
[12:26:12] <smplstk_> you should check: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:27:06] <EmoSpice> Okay - I'm doing a purely horizontal layout, where each "page" is actually a div with a width 100% that of the screen. Everything's working great in FF, Opera, and Chrome. IE, however, is being a bit...difficult. I can't seem to get it to accept a width on the body element. Is this a common problem (doesn't seem to be - google turned nothing super ominous up)?
[12:27:25] <smplstk_> brianpWins: your json needs to come from a specific url
[12:27:48] <josePhoenix> gah
[12:28:00] <smplstk_> brianpWins: you can check out the flickr example on this page: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[12:28:05] <josePhoenix> Why would my $.get() callback get "[]" as data?
[12:28:42] <brianpWins> smplstk_: I have no control over the original request method though so I can't use getJSON. I can only monitor the result it sends back
[12:29:21] <smplstk_> well, that's triggering that, and what's the url? You at least need that data in order for it to work
[12:29:33] <smplstk_> what you had didn't even have a request URL
[12:30:07] <brianpWins> smplstk_: but it works. in chrome if I monitor the network tab the request is made and actually shows me the returned expected json values
[12:30:50] <smplstk_> brianpWins: if that's the case, there must be something more going on than what you shared.
[12:32:17] <brianpWins> smplstk_: it's totally possible. Rails is automagically generating the original request code but doesn't monitor the callback. so anything could be going on in the original request
[12:32:30] <smplstk_> ah
[12:36:12] <dsteinbrunner> hello all
[12:36:25] <dsteinbrunner> had a quick question about .find()
[12:36:29] <smplstk_> typically ajax/JSON requests in jQuery are like : $.getJSON( my_url, function( data ) { console.log( data ) } ); where "my_url" is the page that returns your JSON...
[12:36:43] <smplstk_> ?ask @ dsteinbrunner
[12:36:44] <bot-t> dsteinbrunner, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:37:32] <dsteinbrunner> I noticed that if what you are looking is not found the return value is what you were looking through
[12:37:50] <dsteinbrunner> and I would expect nothing to be returned
[12:38:10] <dsteinbrunner> looking at the docs does not appear to clarify
[12:38:42] <dsteinbrunner> just wanted to make sure this what should be happening
[12:39:52] <EmoSpice> dsteinbrunner: how're you calling find()?
[12:40:09] <EmoSpice> Also - not to be hasty - but no one have any ideas about my earlier question?
[12:40:14] <dsteinbrunner> $(this).find('a')
[12:41:05] <EmoSpice> hmm
[12:41:10] <dsteinbrunner> when an anchor is not present I get $(this) back for the return
[12:41:28] <dsteinbrunner> at least that is how appears
[12:42:18] <EmoSpice> I'm not sure if that's supposed to be, but couldn't you just compare $(this) vs $(this).find('a') to see if you have a result?
[12:42:52] <dsteinbrunner> yeah... I confirm that now
[12:43:30] <EmoSpice> I wouldn't expect the behavior you're seeing either - returning NULL does seem like a better way of handling it.
[12:44:09] <smplstk_> it doesn't work that way, what you should be getting is an empty obj, not null
[12:44:26] <EmoSpice> smplstk_: he's getting the original object back
[12:44:48] <EmoSpice> I should have said an empty object, rather than NULL, as that's what I really meant
[12:47:25] <RikudoSennin> OMG @ trigger_error & debug_backtrace, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN FOR THE LAST 2 MONTHS T_T
[12:47:37] <RikudoSennin> whopps wrong channel :X
[12:48:50] <dsteinbrunner> hmm.. my compare it us not saying they are the same
[12:49:12] <dsteinbrunner> I guess console.log output was just very similar on them
[12:49:22] <systemfault> Comparing the jq objects or the nodes?
[12:49:36] <smplstk_> dsteinbrunner: they are not the same, or they shouldn't be
[12:49:44] <dsteinbrunner> if (a[0] === $(this)[0]) {
[12:52:42] <Jon47> or use the .is method if you're talking about jquery objects
[12:52:49] <dsteinbrunner> alright.. it looks like me just not being familiar enough with console.log's object output
[12:53:05] <smplstk_> yeah, if you're going to do a compare, dsteinbrunner, don't do it like that
[12:53:13] <smplstk_> use .is() as Jon47 mentioned
[12:53:18] <smplstk_> dsteinbrunner: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/ztb4X/
[12:53:26] <dsteinbrunner> Jon47: thanks
[12:57:22] <dsteinbrunner> thanks to smplstk_ and EmoSpice also
[12:57:37] <whateverb> After triggering ajax on my site..jquery functions are working weirdly...like show() .live() etc doesn't work ....but there are no errors in console
[12:58:02] <whateverb> what can be the problem?
[12:59:11] <whateverb> for example .css() works
[12:59:18] <Cradam> why is google telling me that jquery have linked my site?
[13:00:03] <Cradam> Yahoo! is angry at the moment.
[13:00:14] <Cradam> oops wrong chan for the last bit
[13:04:22] <whateverb> no ideas at all? weird it doesn't give me errors or anything, just some functions aren't working
[13:08:56] <Damiox> whateverb: I would open Fiddler and see what Javascript files your web is loading up
[13:10:53] <EmoSpice> For what it's worth, I believe my problem is caused by using the body tag as a wrapper. I'm not sure that IE supports this well enough for me to get consistent results.
[13:11:26] <EmoSpice> A small test case gives me the behavior I want when using a separate div, but not when using the body tag itself.
[13:14:11] <whateverb> Damiox, You think my web is loading wrong files up?
[13:23:47] <r2wj> lo all
[13:25:47] <zoidfarb> I'm a total jquery/javascript neophyte, and what I want to do is add some text to a text input field. This seems to work: $( "#inputid" ).val( $( "#inputid" ).val() + newstring );
[13:26:18] <zoidfarb> but it seems really redundant invoking $( "#inputid" ).val() twice
[13:26:26] <zoidfarb> is there a cleaner/recommended way to do this?
[13:28:31] <zoidfarb>  $( "#inputid" ).val( $this.val + newstring );
[13:28:34] <zoidfarb> or something like that?
[13:29:22] <gnarf> zoidfarb: well, a) you don't need to search for $("#inputid") twice
[13:29:40] <gnarf> so like var input = $("#inputid"); input.val( input.val() + newstring )
[13:29:57] <gnarf> also, .val() can take a function as a param
[13:30:00] <gnarf> ?val( function )
[13:30:02] <bot-t> gnarf, .val() - Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[13:30:18] <gnarf> .val( function(index, value) )
[13:30:54] <gnarf> so input.val( function ( _, val ) { return val + newstring; } );
[13:31:48] <gnarf> that method has the advantange of working on multiple inputs selected
[13:32:00] <zoidfarb> hmm
[13:32:01] <zoidfarb> thanks
[13:32:10] <r2wj> so in this situation gnarf I've found that newlines don't work
[13:32:19] <zoidfarb> what's the _ character do?
[13:32:22] <r2wj> $("#id_description_mkd").attr('placeholder', 'Hello! \n \n I'm now a new line');
[13:32:26] <r2wj> doesn't break the line
[13:32:28] <gnarf> zoidfarb: nothing, just throwing away the "index" param
[13:32:30] <r2wj> what should I do?
[13:32:30] <zoidfarb> are you just signaling you don't want to use that
[13:32:31] <zoidfarb> ok
[13:32:40] <gnarf> zoidfarb: _ is a legal variable name
[13:32:47] <gnarf> zoidfarb: you should read up on caching selectors tho
[13:32:49] <gnarf> ?cache
[13:32:49] <bot-t> gnarf, Google Cache - Syntax: ? cache <url>
[13:32:53] <gnarf> nope
[13:32:57] <gnarf> ?g jquery cache selector
[13:32:58] <bot-t> gnarf, Does jQuery do any kind of caching of "selectors"? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/291841/does-jquery-do-any-kind-of-caching-of-selectors
[13:33:03] <gnarf> boo
[13:33:06] <gnarf> lemme find the article
[13:33:14] <zoidfarb> I did find this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/841722/append-text-to-input-field
[13:33:34] <zoidfarb> but the top answer is the same naive solution I came up with
[13:34:47] <gnarf> its right, but you should really cache the selection
[13:34:50] <gnarf> do you understand why?
[13:35:14] <gnarf> r2wj: try with double quotes instead of single quotes?
[13:35:17] <zoidfarb> it just saves you overhead searching for it again, right?
[13:35:26] <gnarf> ?js '\n' + "\n" + "test"
[13:35:28] <bot-t> gnarf: "\n\ntest"
[13:35:39] <gnarf> zoidfarb: exactly
[13:35:44] <whateverb> so IF im using ajax live search on my page all the events I have in jquery has to be with live() or bind()?
[13:35:54] <gnarf> you shouldn't need to search it again, you already have the ref from earlier
[13:36:22] <r2wj> gnarf - double quotes made no difference
[13:36:25] <r2wj> *shrug*
[13:36:33] <gnarf> perhaps placeholder doesn't support \n's
[13:36:37] <gnarf> I have no clue
[13:36:39] <gnarf> see ?p
[13:36:39] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:37:02] <RikudoSennin> r2wj: newlines are not accepted in placeholders
[13:37:20] <RikudoSennin> it's nothing because of your code, that's just the way it is
[13:39:14] <r2wj> tarnation!
[13:39:19] <r2wj> thanks RikudoSennin and gnarf

[13:42:16] <zoidfarb> @gnarf, that's awesome. That will be helpful to future googlers, I'm sure.
[13:42:24] <RikudoSennin> madprops: w00t??
[13:42:29] <gnarf> zoidfarb: gotta love stack overflow :)
[13:43:34] <madprops> RikudoSennin, i want the image to appear bigger when I click it with a semitransparent overlay modal window, and make it dissapear when it gets click on again
[13:43:38] <zoidfarb> It's like expertsexchange, except not-terrible!
[13:43:48] <madprops> stackoverflow is godsend
[13:44:00] <gnarf> expert sex change?
[13:44:51] <RikudoSennin> only one picture?

[13:44:56] <RikudoSennin> or may have many?
[13:45:29] <gnarf> madprops: what you want is called a lightbox generally and there are a ton of plugins out there for it

[13:48:57] <gnarf> madprops: i dunno, i haven't really used them
[13:50:03] <dnyy> is there a way to have slice stop at 0 instead of using a negative index (on start) as an offset? so that [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].slice(-2, 6) would return [1,2,3,4,5,6]?
[13:50:37] <gnarf> dnyy: don't pass a negative number to slice?
[13:51:09] <gnarf> ?js var a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], start = -2;  a.slice( start < 0 ? 0 : start, 6 )
[13:51:11] <bot-t> gnarf: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

[14:55:19] * RandalSchwartz waves at the channel
[14:55:29] <RandalSchwartz> are datatable questions ok here?
[14:55:37] <RandalSchwartz> datatables.net stuff
[14:55:52] <RandalSchwartz> I presume it's a simple thing, but I'm not able to parse the docs well :)
[14:56:17] <djQuery> ?ask@ RandalSchwartz
[14:56:17] <bot-t> RandalSchwartz, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:56:39] <RandalSchwartz> this is a meta-question, as in if datatables.net questions are welcome
[14:56:42] <RandalSchwartz> so I *am* asking the question
[14:56:54] <djQuery> lol
[14:57:31] <RandalSchwartz> so without further preamble... is there a way to get at the current value of the "search" filter when I submit?
[14:57:47] <RandalSchwartz> I'm not sure how those options are stored so I can get at them.
[14:57:51] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz: you mean server side or client side?
[14:58:00] <RandalSchwartz> I need to have the value server side
[14:58:07] <RandalSchwartz> but I've done client-side filtering too
[14:58:43] <vladikoff> hey RandalSchwartz!! nice to see you back in #jquery!
[14:58:49] <RandalSchwartz> I suspect I'll need to create a hidden field out of the current sSearch value
[14:58:53] <RandalSchwartz> but I don't know how to find that value
[15:00:17] <RandalSchwartz> I have $('#table').dataTable({     "oSearch": { "sSearch": "", "bRegex": true, "bSmart": false }, })
[15:00:20] <RandalSchwartz> basically
[15:00:31] <RandalSchwartz> so initially, sSearch is empty
[15:00:45] <RandalSchwartz> I'm trying to get its *current* value when a submit button in a form is pressed
[15:03:46] <djQuery> damn it puts enough stuff in the querystring dont it
[15:04:03] <djQuery> but I dont see anywhere that it actualy puts the search value
[15:04:13] <djQuery> gues it only does client side searching.

[15:17:08] <mikl> I have a strange issue with $.ajax(). If I try to set the contentType with the line commented out in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/mZ23M/1/ - the AJAX-request doesn't seem to really happen, but the success-callback is called and Firefox makes an OPTIONS http request to the server?

[15:23:39] <whitelynx> i'm running into some unexpected behavior with the Tabs widget in jQueryUI (in both 1.8.11 and 1.8.14)... if I specify the 'spinner' option, the spinner is never removed after the load is finished.
[15:24:00] <blaamann> In general, is chaining faster than 'sequential'? Or perhaps slower?
[15:24:43] <cam_> hello friends
[15:25:39] <cam_> i need a little help
[15:25:59] <japherwocky> blaamann: what is the difference between chaining and sequential?
[15:26:03] <cam_> i can use slideUp() but i can't use slideDwen()
[15:26:22] <cam_> i will be very happy if some body help me
[15:26:23] <japherwocky> cam_: you are spelling Down() wrong
[15:26:43] <cam_> in the JS file i writen well
[15:27:09] <cam_> slideUp works perfectly, but slideDown doesn't work
[15:27:41] <japherwocky> you can try pasting your code somewhere and asking someone to read it
[15:27:47] <japherwocky> that's not much to go on

[15:37:46] <kendru> I have been working on my first site using jQuery, and I have found a portion of my code that seems to be breaking the page in IE8. Could I get some help?
[15:37:47] <kendru> http://jsfiddle.net/kendru/SZc28/
[15:38:20] <dabear> kendru: nice wall of text
[15:38:35] <dabear> you didn't mention what the problem was...
[15:39:45] <cam_> hello
[15:41:25] <kendru> dabear: when I run the page in IE, it gives the error, "A problem with this webpage caused Internet Explorer to close and reopen the tab", and none of the javascript on the page will load.
[15:41:56] <bot-t> cam, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:42:02] <dabear> kendru: ok, first do this: ?reduce
[15:42:13] <dabear> kendru: see ?reduce
[15:42:13] <bot-t> kendru, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[15:43:09] <kendru> I'll give it a shot. Hopefully I won't be back in a few minutes.
[15:54:30] <kendru> thanks! i ended up finding the problem.

[15:56:06] <dabear> kendru: which was? *curious*
[15:57:30] <kendru> hehe. i forgot to remove one piece of my firefox debugging code. i still had a call to console.log().
[15:57:54] <madprops> can anybody help me getting this to work? http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2  i followed the instructions yet the lightbox doesn't show, could it be it doesn't work with external images?
[15:58:00] <kendru> dabear: so not a jquery issue at all. just a dumb programmer issue
[15:58:12] <dabear> shit happens :)
[16:00:39] <slaeke> im back
[16:00:44] <slaeke> aj, you around?
[16:02:16] <slaeke> or anyone?
[16:03:50] <cam_> who can help me?
[16:03:58] <slaeke> depends on your question :)
[16:04:09] <slaeke> i'm here to ask one of my own, but seems we are the only ones active at the moment
[16:04:09] <cam_> it is very simple
[16:04:15] <slaeke> k, shoot, I'll see what I can do
[16:05:17] * dabear shoots slaeke in the arm
[16:05:26] <slaeke> haha
[16:05:31] <slaeke> ouch
[16:05:34] <dabear> now, can you do anything with your arm?
[16:05:42] <cam_> i sent you an PM
[16:05:44] <slaeke> nope, arm dead.
[16:06:04] <dabear> we have a channel
[16:06:08] <dabear> use it, not PMs
[16:06:19] <cam_> http://200.58.112.62/~camis/test/
[16:06:28] <cam_> why slideDoen doesn't work??
[16:06:34] <cam_> slideDown i say
[16:07:04] <slaeke> well
[16:07:06] <slaeke> for starters
[16:07:24] <slaeke> you dont have your slideDown in an event function
[16:07:33] <slaeke> so, its prolly already happened by the time you see the page load
[16:07:52] <cam_> allother slide works fine
[16:07:59] <cam_> because are slideUp
[16:10:31] <cam_> i think it is a mistery
[16:10:36] <cam_> nobody knows
[16:10:58] <dabear> your mom knows
[16:11:29] <slaeke> haha, well you dont have any content in that div, so how do you know if it has moved or not?
[16:12:01] <slaeke> hey dabear, can i ask you a question?
[16:12:07] <cam_> i have a div with a background img
[16:12:09] <dabear> yes
[16:12:35] <slaeke> @cam, your div has no actual content and the bg image is the same as the whole page bg, so you wouldnt be able to tell when it moved
[16:12:40] <cam_> when the above div slide down appear the other div
[16:13:01] <slaeke> then i dunno
[16:13:02] <cam_> Man, try slideUp and everything is okay
[16:13:11] <cam_> but slideDown doesn't work
[16:13:46] <slaeke> dabear, i'm having an issue with trying to manipulate fields that are loaded in via prototype ajax
[16:13:57] <slaeke> im doing a site for a real estate client of mine
[16:14:07] <slaeke> and they need a third party house listing search service
[16:14:19] <slaeke> that service gives us an externally hosted and coded page
[16:14:22] <slaeke> that I get to style
[16:14:37] <slaeke> but the fields that they offer are silly large multi-selects
[16:14:37] <dabear> hm, ok
[16:14:45] <slaeke> and I'm trying to remove the "multiple" attrib
[16:14:49] <slaeke> to make them just dropdowns
[16:15:06] <slaeke> but, since they are being brought in via prototype ajax, I cant use jquery to fix them
[16:15:29] <slaeke> so, I'm wondering if there's any plugin I can use to execute jquery code after non-jquery ajax completes.
[16:15:31] <slaeke> ??
[16:16:01] <cam_> somedays here are so pro jquery people
[16:16:07] <cam_> today is not the day
[16:16:24] <slaeke> @cam, i cant see any reason why slideDOwn wouldnt work
[16:16:30] <slaeke> so im stumped
[16:17:32] <slaeke> any ideas dabears?
[16:18:03] <bot-t> slaeke, Plugins/livequery - Live Query utilizes the power of jQuery selectors by binding events or firing callbacks for matched elements auto-magically, even after the page has been loaded and the DOM updated. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[16:18:15] <cam_> i am losing my time here
[16:18:20] <cam_> well i have to go
[16:18:47] <slaeke> i did try livequery, but couldn't get it to work either
[16:18:47] <cam_> good luck
[16:20:23] <dabear> slaeke: you can hook into the dom contents modified event, but that is totally unsupported in several browsers
[16:20:45] <dabear> couldn't you use prototype instead?
[16:20:56] <dabear> to make the ajax hooks at least
[16:22:40] <dabear> slaeke: Ajax.Responders.register({ onComplete: function(){  do your magic here} }
[16:23:16] <slaeke> hmmm, so I just tried livequery again, and it worked on SOME fields, but not all...
[16:23:22] <slaeke> lemme look into that for a sec..
[16:24:21] <dabear> slaeke: livequery will only work if jquery is used for the updating part
[16:24:31] <slaeke> ya
[16:24:32] <dabear> e.g. .html(), .append() etc
[16:24:42] <slaeke> ive got jquery commands to do the removal of the attribs..
[16:24:46] <slaeke> and its working
[16:24:50] <dabear> as prototype has another implementation, that wouldn't work
[16:24:55] <slaeke> i wonder why it didnt last night when I tried to do this...
[16:25:46] <slaeke> ok
[16:25:51] <slaeke> so, it doesn't ALWAYS work...
[16:26:05] <slaeke> if i refresh the page, and the add-in takes a bit too long, livequery doesn't work.
[16:27:19] <slaeke> ideas?
[16:30:12] <gnarf> slaeke: i've never liked the liveQuery concept/plugin
[16:30:36] <gnarf> ?newContent
[16:30:37] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[16:30:43] <gnarf> that was my response to the livequery
[16:31:07] <gnarf> a slightly different approach, but one that I think is much more maintainable / less wasteful than something like livequery
[16:31:25] <slaeke> hmm
[16:31:33] <slaeke> does that work with non-jquery ajax adds?
[16:31:57] <gnarf> you have code adding content to your page that isn't controlled by you?
[16:32:29] <slaeke> yep
[16:32:36] <slaeke> its prototype.js ajax
[16:32:51] <slaeke> livequery works, but not everytime
[16:32:55] <dabear> slaeke: use my solution:p
[16:33:07] <dabear> Ajax.Responders.register({ onComplete: function(){  do your magic here} }
[16:33:21] <slaeke> haha, i'm about to try that, but I don't know jack crap about prototype, and I have other jquery stuff i have to do to this page..
[16:33:26] <jorenl_> is there a way to rescale an element completely? (so in/decrease width, height but also borders, padding, font size etc)
[16:33:30] <slaeke> how would I run prototype JS and jquery at the same time?
[16:33:41] <gnarf> slaeke: why are you using this prototype ajax shit then?
[16:33:43] <dabear> slaeke: you can mix jquery and prototype as much as you want
[16:33:45] <slaeke> i'm not
[16:33:54] <dabear> just use the prototype responders
[16:33:56] <slaeke> its a real estate service that my client is using
[16:34:17] <slaeke> and its the only service of its kind that I've found that allows me to style the elements at all...but they are using multiselects, and they suck...
[16:34:25] <slaeke> i dont have any control over the fields
[16:34:30] <gnarf> slaeke: and they haven't given you an extension point in the JS to be alerted when elements are added?
[16:34:36] <slaeke> nope.
[16:34:40] <gnarf> complain
[16:34:44] <gnarf> and hack one in
[16:34:46] <slaeke> ya
[16:34:53] <slaeke> thats what i'm trying to do
[16:34:59] <gnarf> find where they add the element to the dom
[16:35:05] <gnarf> use something like my newContent()
[16:35:33] <slaeke> does newContent work on non-jquery ajax?
[16:35:47] <gnarf> slaeke: newContent works on DOM Elements
[16:36:03] <gnarf> it doesn't detect them tho, you have to specifically call newContent
[16:36:17] <slaeke> hmm
[16:36:27] <slaeke> thats fine
[16:36:33] <gnarf> jQuery( newDOMElements ).newContent() from the prototype code should work fine
[16:36:36] <slaeke> I could do $('select').newCOntent()
[16:36:54] <gnarf> you only want to "newContent" on "new content" tho, so be careful
[16:37:17] <slaeke> thats fine
[16:37:24] <gnarf> my example on that gist should explain it pretty well
[16:38:52] <gnarf> jorenl_: yes, there is a way, but its not terribly easy, and suffers from rounding issues... look at the UI "Scale" effect - we do it there
[16:39:12] <jorenl_> gnarf: thanks
[16:42:14] <slaeke> @gnarf, newContent didnt work
[16:42:21] <slaeke> wait
[16:42:22] <slaeke> hold on
[16:42:24] <slaeke> typo
[16:42:26] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[16:42:27] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[16:42:37] <gnarf> :)
[16:42:47] <jorenl_> gnarf: I must have done something wrong :/
[16:42:48] <jorenl_> Fout: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Node cannot be inserted at the specified point in the hierarchy"  code: "3" nsresult: "0x80530003 (NS_ERROR_DOM_HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR)"  location: "http://joren.ath.cx/gs/static/jquery.js Line: 17"]
[16:43:14] <gnarf> that tells me nothing
[16:43:39] <slaeke> ok, fixed typo, newContent still not working
[16:43:45] <jorenl_> gnarf: I'm sorry.
[16:44:01] <gnarf> ?doesn't work @slaeke
[16:44:02] <bot-t> slaeke, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[16:44:14] <gnarf> ?p @slaeke
[16:44:15] <bot-t> slaeke, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:44:16] <slaeke> no error msg, just doesn't do whT I coded
[16:44:23] <slaeke> one sec, i'll give you code
[16:44:41] <slaeke> jQuery(document).ready( function () {
[16:44:41] <slaeke> jQuery('select').newContent(function() {
[16:44:41] <slaeke> this.removeAttr('multiple');
[16:44:41] <slaeke> this.removeAttr('size');
[16:44:41] <slaeke> });
[16:44:42] <slaeke> });
[16:44:59] <slaeke> and, when the page loads, both attribs are still there
[16:45:01] <dekhaus> Hi All.   What's the jQuery equivalent of Prototype's 'focus' call ?
[16:45:20] <slaeke> @dek, use :focus on your selecter
[16:45:33] <slaeke> as in $('#id:focus').hide()
[16:45:40] <jorenl_> http://jsfiddle.net
[16:45:52] <slaeke> or
[16:46:04] <slaeke> $('#id').focus();
[16:46:10] <dekhaus> thx
[16:46:13] <slaeke> np
[16:46:31] <slaeke> gnarf
[16:46:49] <slaeke> if youre interested, the page i'm working on is: http://www.providencerealtygroupnc.idxco.com/idx/11166/advancedSearch.php
[16:47:49] <slaeke> oh ok
[16:47:52] <slaeke> hold on
[16:49:17] <gnarf> slaeke: did you ever call .newContent() on the select as it is added from the prototype ajax callback?
[16:49:20] <slaeke> http://jsfiddle.net/sMgaC/
[16:49:29] <slaeke> no, I can't do that
[16:49:34] <slaeke> its not my ajax
[16:49:53] <slaeke> so i dont think newContent will work for me
[16:49:53] <gnarf> you can't edit their .js file?
[16:49:57] <slaeke> nope
[16:50:04] <gnarf> you lie :)
[16:50:19] <slaeke> no i dont
[16:50:25] <slaeke> the .js file is inserted via php
[16:50:36] <slaeke> and i have no control over that
[16:51:00] <slaeke> in any case, I'd much rather mess with the fields AFTER they are added
[16:51:16] <gnarf> not if you want reliable code
[16:51:17] <digitalfiz> so im using $.post to grab remote select statements but when i hit submit the selects that are added dont show in the print of the #_POST array only the input feilds that already existed is there something I have to do after adding form elements via $.post or $.ajax?
[16:51:24] <slaeke> so that if the site gets a redesign by someone else, they can just deleted my changes and not have anything be messed up
[16:51:39] <gnarf> digitalfiz: see ?p ?
[16:51:39] <bot-t> digitalfiz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:51:42] <dabear> slaeke: .........
[16:52:04] <digitalfiz> *sigh*
[16:52:04] <dabear> USE THE FUCKING Ajax.Responders method.
[16:52:08] <dabear> it WILL work
[16:52:09] <slaeke> look, this is not a preferrable solution, I know, but in the real estate world, I was lucky to fnd a solution that wasn't iframed
[16:52:12] <slaeke> lol
[16:52:14] <slaeke> OK OK
[16:52:26] <slaeke> lemme PM you
[16:52:43] <dabear> why not do it here..
[16:53:14] <gnarf> digitalfiz: why sighs?
[16:53:28] <slaeke> hey, I literally know jack shit about prototype
[16:53:28] <slaeke> so, that code you pasted me before
[16:53:28] <slaeke> does it need semi-colons
[16:53:28] <slaeke> ?
[16:53:48] <gnarf> digitalfiz: you just explained a concept using non-finite terms, code for your $.post might help
[16:53:51] <slaeke> do i need to wrap it in any kind of doc.ready or init function?
[16:54:36] <digitalfiz> gnarf, its a very complicated setup i cant really just past somewhere. Basically i use .change on a select statement so when its changed $.post grabs another select statement and puts it below it but when i hit submit the added select fields dont show up in php. I can see them when i inspect with chrome though they are properly formatted and all
[16:54:50] <digitalfiz> let me try and paste parts of it maybe that will help
[16:55:42] <gnarf> digitalfiz: are they being added inside the <form> tag?
[16:55:51] <digitalfiz> yes
[16:55:54] <gnarf> do they have a "name" ?
[16:55:58] <digitalfiz> yup
[16:56:24] <digitalfiz> they are names data[ebay_cats][1] data[ebay_cats][2] data[ebay_cats][3] so on
[16:56:29] <gnarf> debugging tip: try looking at the $("form").submit(function(){ console.log( $(this).seralize() ); });
[16:56:33] <gnarf> make sure the data looks right
[16:56:59] <gnarf> are you using the standard form submission, or are you overriding that with ajax too?
[16:57:25] <gnarf> also, you might want to use the term "select element" instead of "select statement"
[16:57:26] <gnarf> :)
[16:57:36] <cam_> hello
[16:58:09] <cam_> hey friends
[16:58:29] <cam_> does jquery works fine in iphone's browser?
[16:58:29] <digitalfiz> gnarf, its a normal form submission the only thing ajax is adding the select dropdowns
[16:58:32] <dabear> hey mom!
[16:58:44] <dabear> cam_: ofcouse not
[16:58:52] <dabear> iphone cannot handle javascript
[16:58:59] <dabear> not css either
[16:59:01] <gnarf> digitalfiz: then my assumption is that the <select> element isn't inside the <form>
[16:59:17] <gnarf> but you say that isn't the case
[16:59:43] <gnarf> at least i don't think the select element is inside the form when you submit it, or it doesn't have a name when you submit it
[16:59:44] <cam_> mmmmm
[16:59:52] <gnarf> or otherwise the value would be present and passed along
[16:59:53] <digitalfiz> it uses .html() to put the select element into a <span></span> thats inside the form its right below the hardcoded select element i see it in the inspector :/
[17:00:41] <gnarf> digitalfiz: something yer able to share an URL to if reproducing on jsfiddle is too much of an issue?
[17:01:31] <cam_> but iphone uses safari?
[17:01:39] <dabear> no
[17:01:42] <dabear> it uses android
[17:01:58] <RandalSchwartz> heh
[17:02:52] <gnarf> cam_: dabear is messing with you... both iPhone and Android builtin browsers are using a mobile webkit build
[17:03:01] <gnarf> of course they support javascript
[17:03:05] <aaairc> Anyone have any recommendations on using Google Maps. Would you advise using API directly or trying out one of the Google Map Plugins? Thanks for any advice!
[17:03:10] <RandalSchwartz> android uses webkit?
[17:03:11] <cam_> grrrr
[17:03:12] <gnarf> and jQuery is actively tested on andriod and iOS
[17:03:13] <RandalSchwartz> not chrome?
[17:03:19] <gnarf> RandalSchwartz: chrome uses webkit
[17:03:20] <cam_> i am happy now
[17:03:25] <RandalSchwartz> ah
[17:03:37] <cam_> gnaf can you help me a little?
[17:04:01] <gnarf> not before you try to help yourself and fail
[17:04:03] <cam_> you seems to be pro
[17:04:05] <dabear> yes, but that costs 100 USD per line in PM you send him
[17:04:16] * gnarf giggles
[17:04:26] <dabear> gotta make it short
[17:04:41] <digitalfiz> gnarf, http://cl.ly/3e2m0t3i1f1P2K2i1O1T
[17:04:45] <cam_> i am trying to emulate a small flash intro in jquery
[17:05:02] <gnarf> aaairc: the plugins are usualy just wrappers for the maps code itself to make the api a bit more jqueryish
[17:05:20] <gnarf> aaairc: id suggest trying without a plugin first and seeing if you really need it (which you probbly wont)
[17:05:38] <gnarf> cam_: sounds like a pain ;)
[17:05:39] <aaairc> gnarf: ok thanks for the advice... i'll try that approach then.
[17:05:44] <digitalfiz> gnarf, see under eBay Category the 3 selects? Only the first one works  and all the input feilds below it work to because they are all in the form element
[17:05:46] <cam_> hahaha
[17:05:55] <cam_> but is a very simple flash intro
[17:06:18] <cam_> but i have a problem
[17:06:18] <gnarf> digitalfiz: did you try that form seralize on submit thing?
[17:06:21] <digitalfiz> gnarf, here is the code: http://cl.ly/0Y2O3R0z28222K353Y1k
[17:06:33] <cam_> i can use slideUp but i cant use slide Down
[17:06:41] <gnarf> so the data[ebay_cat][0] shows up fine?
[17:06:52] <digitalfiz> and here is the results in php: http://cl.ly/3d0X2Y1v163K26362M3M
[17:07:10] <gnarf> hrm
[17:07:17] <gnarf> digitalfiz: what are the "value" of the options in the select?
[17:07:27] <digitalfiz> numerics
[17:07:50] <gnarf> yer sure the <option value=""> is set? (and not just saying what you think it is? :) )
[17:08:05] <digitalfiz> http://cl.ly/0X271y3y3S2g0m1p0w2s
[17:08:08] <gnarf> $("form").submit(function(){ console.log( $(this).seralize() ); });
[17:08:33] <digitalfiz> ill try that real quick see what it does
[17:08:49] <gnarf> might need to put a breakpoint/debugger; on it
[17:08:55] <gnarf> or make sure console persists
[17:08:59] <gnarf> or return false
[17:09:05] <gnarf> so the browser doesn't change pages right after
[17:09:06] <gnarf> :)
[17:09:53] <cam_> gnarf
[17:10:20] <cam_> my problem is very basic
[17:10:32] <gnarf> cam_: you are aware that slideUp() and slideDown() are hide/show right?
[17:10:39] <digitalfiz> gnarf, it says object has no method serialize lol
[17:10:49] <gnarf> so "slideDown" does nothing on an element that is already shown
[17:11:13] <cam_> good point
[17:11:14] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/serialize @digitalfiz
[17:11:31] <cam_> give me a minute i will try
[17:11:55] <gnarf> cam: perhaps you meant to just use ?animate with a height?
[17:11:55] <bot-t> cam, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[17:12:26] <cam_> i am using only basic functions for the effects
[17:12:40] <gnarf> "animate" is about the most basic it gets there
[17:12:59] <cam_> http://200.58.112.62/~camis/test/
[17:13:05] <cam_> check what i am doing
[17:13:07] <gnarf> slideUp slideDown fadeIn fadeOut etc are all frontends to animate
[17:13:46] <gnarf> how about i don't click on your link, I'll help you if the issue is broken/running on a jsfiddle, but I'm not going to dig through someone elses code for bugs
[17:13:55] <ikla> how do I include a script when document.ready() ?
[17:13:57] <ikla> within
[17:14:02] <gnarf> ?getScript @ikla
[17:14:03] <bot-t> ikla, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[17:14:27] <gnarf> ikla: might make more sense to just include the <script> tag tho
[17:14:30] <cam_> i only wanted you view what i am doing :(
[17:14:30] <ikla> getscript(url) is enuff?
[17:14:34] <cam_> only that
[17:14:39] <gnarf> $.getScript( url )
[17:14:40] <ikla> script tag still loads
[17:14:41] <ikla> within
[17:14:51] <gnarf> cam_: i'm not concerned with what you are doing.
[17:15:16] <digitalfiz> gnarf, just keeps saying 	.	Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'seralize'
[17:15:23] <gnarf> digitalfiz: missing an i?
[17:15:41] <digitalfiz> lol thats what i get for copy/pasting :P
[17:15:54] <gnarf> sorry if i was responsible for that typo ;)
[17:16:04] <gnarf> my fingers and keyboard aren't being very good friends today
[17:17:18] <digitalfiz> gnarf, it doesnt show it in the consol log either
[17:17:25] <cam_> can i load a jquery code once all the images and css in a web are loaded?
[17:17:35] <gnarf> digitalfiz: hrm... try putting a breakpoint there
[17:17:56] <gnarf> then check like $( this ).find( "select" )
[17:18:04] <gnarf> and poke around your dom
[17:18:13] <gnarf> make 100% sure those selects are in the form
[17:18:54] <gnarf> if you're still having problems after you play with it for like 5 more minutes, try to get me a link to the actual page you're having issues with and I can try to poke around
[17:19:59] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded @cam
[17:19:59] <bot-t> cam, imagesLoaded() jquery plugin ¬ó Gist - https://gist.github.com/268257
[17:20:42] <cam_> thanks bot
[17:20:46] <cam_> you are my best friend
[17:20:47] <gnarf> cam_: also, $( document ).ready( function ) or its alias $( function ) should happen after CSS is loaded, but can happen before in some situations
[17:22:50] <cam_> ok
[17:23:08] <cam_> gnaf
[17:23:41] <cam_> to use slideDown the element must have visibility = hidden ?
[17:23:50] <gnarf> no, display: none
[17:24:39] <cam_> ok
[17:24:54] <cam_> you are not a bot really?
[17:26:05] <cam_> now it works fine
[17:28:11] * gnarf claps 
[17:28:51] <ikla> hrmm getscript not working and not firing off my function
[17:29:09] <ikla> can I do document.ready { then my <script src=""> ?
[17:34:44] <digitalfiz> gnarf, if i put the select elements in there hardcoded they work fine
[17:35:54] <digitalfiz> gnarf, do you know if there needs to be any kind of "update" done to the DOM or anything to make it work ive never had the problem before
[17:36:32] <gnarf> digitalfiz: i in fact know that that no update to the dom or anything needs to be done
[17:36:45] <gnarf> you can (and i do) inject hidden inputs into forms no problem
[17:37:30] <dabear> man, I think I gotta go to bed
[17:37:47] <dabear> read that as "hardcore worked fine"
[17:41:59] <digitalfiz> i hate stupid little problems like this
[17:42:45] <digitalfiz> gnarf, see this: http://cl.ly/082u1I100U3S192s1K1F
[17:43:20] <digitalfiz> thats hardcoded select statements and i get this results: http://cl.ly/1g3H0h2O380g242S1Q3a
[17:43:25] <gnarf> digitalfiz: yeah, im puzzled too, wont be here much longer, so if u want me to dig in on the console for a bit share a link to it quick :)
[17:43:45] <digitalfiz> its got like 5 passwords to get to it the customer is very paranoid :/
[17:44:21] <digitalfiz> thanks for the help though ill mess with it till it smacks me in the face im sure its something simple
[17:45:02] <dabear> digitalfiz: what's wrong? :/
[17:45:14] <dabear> seems correct :/
[17:45:32] <digitalfiz> dabear, did you see the 2 pics i just pasted
[17:45:58] <dabear> yup
[17:45:59] <digitalfiz> thats the expected results
[17:46:10] <gnarf> dabear: he's having an issue where <select> elements he's adding to the DOM aren't being submitted with the <form> that contains them
[17:46:14] <digitalfiz> but when i add those select elements with $.post it doesnt work
[17:46:42] <dabear> a demo, if we may?
[17:47:03] <digitalfiz> all i can give is pics
[17:47:17] <digitalfiz> its behind a few passwords
[17:47:24] <RandalSchwartz> only a few?
[17:47:27] <RandalSchwartz> that's not a challenge!
[17:47:32] <digitalfiz> lol
[17:48:41] <gnarf> digitalfiz: not sure if i can offer any more inspiration without seeing it in action
[17:51:53] <dabear> digitalfiz: yep, good luck finding the error
[17:58:00] <differentSmoke> Question: I'm having a problem with the jquery validate plugin. I have to click the submit button 2 times in order for the form to submit. Does anyone know what the problem might be?
[18:03:25] <symaxian> Is there a jQuery plugin to easily link a couple of inputs/span elements to JS properties? Showing their value and/or changing them from the inputs
[18:07:15] <misterm> symaxian: there might be, but that should be pretty easy to do with a couple event listeners
[18:08:48] <symaxian> Yeah, think I'm just going to write a little script that will link JS variables to elements, checkboxes to booleans, inputs to strings and so on
[18:17:49] <gnarf> ?hi5 @digitalfiz
[18:17:50] <bot-t> digitalfiz, ‚Åµ
[18:18:02] <digitalfiz> :D!
[18:18:14] <digitalfiz> ?hi5 @gnarf
[18:18:14] <bot-t> gnarf, ‚Åµ
[18:18:24] <digitalfiz> thanks for the help man i knew it was something simple
[18:18:31] <gnarf> yeah, those problems are hard to find
[18:32:48] <Sempra> Hey guys, does the css visibility, hidden attribute stop .show() effects from loading in Chrome? I have a simple DIV I can move all around, unless I've hidden it via CSS, then jQuery doesn't seem to do anything. Without error.
[18:38:08] <mikehershey> hi im passing an array to the data param to ajax() and its automatically adding [] to the end of the param name, is there a way you can have it not modify the parameter name?
[18:40:11] <misterm> Sempra: .show() sets display, not visibility
[18:41:06] <Sempra> So I guess my question follows: How do I have one element hidden onload of the document so that I can toggle between the two.
[18:41:28] <Sempra> do I need to use .load and hide it and then show it later?
[18:41:55] <gnarf> Sempra: hide it with css?
[18:42:11] <gnarf> display: none
[18:42:18] <misterm> Sempra: you can either use the display property, or toggle the visibility yourself
[18:42:35] <Sempra> Ah I see, I had display and visibilty swaped
[18:42:45] <Sempra> Thank you :)
[18:43:19] <Sempra> fucking perfect.
[18:43:21] <aghouseh> display does not render
[18:43:52] <aghouseh> visibility renders but does not show it.. so an item still has size if its just set to visibility: hidden
[18:43:54] <misterm> Yea, disiplay affects rendering, visibility just affects...cisibility
[18:44:44] <Sempra> Which is awesome. I knew it wasn't so complicated. I kept looking at peoples example code and wondering eventually if it was a chrome issue, lol. The finite nuances of CSS tend to elude me at these early stages.
[18:45:23] <misterm> Sempra: did you get a different behaviour in other browsers?
[18:46:37] <Sempra> I believe at this point the difference I saw in FF was of my own creation.
[18:47:05] <misterm> Sempra: ok, I was gonna say afaik it should be consistent across browsers
[18:47:34] <Sempra> I'm expecting more complexity from jquery so I am overthinking it I believe.
[19:17:37] <Damiox> hi
[19:22:25] <Gotactics> yo
[19:29:12] <freenodiz> hy
[19:30:29] <freenodiz> i'm new to jquery...looking for a way to download a jquery menu with google chrome dev tools to study the code...is that possible?

[20:18:00] <bot-t> cypha, Thursday, 2011-07-07 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110707.log.html
[20:18:05] <ajpiano> wow
[20:18:08] <ajpiano> this is going awfully
[20:18:13] <kborchers> Zico: then something else is wrong with your code ... this works http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/aw7XK/
[20:18:29] <ajpiano> cypha http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html
[20:24:18] <Zico> kborchers: looks like it only works if the field-adder is outside the functions. Not sure why
[20:25:05] <kborchers> not sure what you mean see ?demo
[20:25:05] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:28:05] <Zico> http://jsfiddle.net/66CK5/
[20:29:20] <kborchers> ?live @ Zico
[20:29:21] <bot-t> Zico, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[20:29:48] <kborchers> that is what you need. the click binding only happens on elements that already exist. live will bind them as they are added as well
[20:30:13] <kborchers> http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/66CK5/1/
[20:30:23] <Zico> i see. Thank you! :) Been stuck on this one awhile and didn't know what to search for
[20:32:02] <kborchers> Zico: but don't use live if that is the only time you need it ... instead just move the click binding inside the other click binding http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/66CK5/2/
[20:35:16] <cypha> ajpiano: why are you showing me a join quit list?
[20:35:45] <ajpiano> the bot googled something by confusion
[20:35:46] <ajpiano> sorry about that
[20:35:52] <ajpiano> look at the jquery fundamentals book
[20:35:56] <cypha> oh ok, lol, np
[20:35:58] <cypha> thanks for the link
[20:36:02] <ajpiano> what he googled was logs from this channe l:p
[20:59:19] <kborchers> Gotactics: no pm's please just ask your question. i don't mind helping when i can but i do it here.
[21:40:24] <Sempra> Hrm. So I am looking into a simple single e-mail form validation. I just want to check and see if @ and . are inside the text field when the user clicks. Is there a way to validate whether those characters are in a formfield string?
[21:51:15] <kborchers> Sempra: if that's all you want to validate, on submit, var email = $("#emailID").val(); then if(email.indexOf("@") && email.indexOf(".") {submit form} else (show error}
[21:52:01] <Sempra> ahh thats what I was missing. the var being set with .var.
[21:52:16] <Sempra> I tried indexOf but couldn't... yah ok. Thank you! :D
[21:52:41] <kborchers> np
[22:05:22] <lanks> Im using jquery ui sortable to do drag & drop sorting of a set of divs. Each div has two child divs. I only want the div to drag when one of the children is dragged. Anyone know if this is possible?
[22:06:49] <kborchers> lanks: see http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ and look at the handle option
[22:08:47] <lanks> thanks kborchers
[22:08:55] <kborchers> np
[22:13:44] <madprops> is there a way to check of a string equals a string with no case sensitivity?
[22:13:50] <madprops> if*
[22:14:32] <Gotactics> madprops theres a probably like a tolower() function
[22:14:56] <madprops> orly
[22:14:58] <madprops> cool thanx
[22:15:26] <kborchers> madprops: yep, it's toLowerCase()
[22:20:31] <Sempra> Ok so here is my small amount of code with the form validation: http://chopapp.com/#gnl649nq
[22:21:09] <Sempra> All of my code works until I add lines 3 and 4. Then I just get a JS error over and over saying line 14 has an unexpected } closing
[22:22:34] <Sempra> Any ideas where my logic is flawed
[22:22:51] <kborchers> Sempra: you're missing a } before the ) on 13
[22:23:14] <kborchers> and then you need a ; at the end of 13
[22:24:01] <Sempra> Oh because of the .live();
[22:24:07] <kborchers> yep
[22:26:06] <duke2> helloo
[22:26:27] <cam> hello
[22:26:59] <cam> somebody here?
[22:27:09] <kborchers> ?ask @ cam
[22:27:09] <bot-t> cam, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:27:20] <cam> hello friend
[22:27:54] <cam> i have a code that i need to load when all images and css are loaded
[22:28:51] <kborchers> waiting for images to load is inconsistent across browsers. the best you can do is use window.load but it still may not be perfect
[22:29:48] <cam> or at least i need to wait 3 seconds since the body text is loaded, 3 seconds to give time to load images and css
[22:33:33] <Sempra> Ugh. I put an alert in to check, and "cemail" is being set correctly but it's acting as if it's ignoring the if/else check.
[22:36:33] <cam> <kborchers> or at least i need to wait 3 seconds since the body text is loaded, 3 seconds to give time to load images and css
[22:37:53] <Sempra> hrm.
[22:38:00] <Sempra> Must be something stupid because this shit looks good.
[22:38:12] <kborchers> cam: setting some arbitrary amount of time to wait is not a good solution. you have no idea if 3 seconds is long enough since you can't control the user's internet speed. if you must, you can use setTimeout
[22:38:30] <kborchers> Sempra: i don't see anything wrong with that code so not sure what's up
[22:38:36] <Sempra> Same.
[22:38:45] <cam> that is true kborchers
[22:38:51] <Sempra> Everything works, which is the scary part.
[22:39:01] <cam> but it is the only i can do
[22:45:49] <djQuery> cam: not to mention if they have cacheing turned on and visit a 2nd time they still have to wait 3 secs
[22:46:13] <cam> it is true :(
[22:46:33] <cam> but all this is only for the Index of the web
[22:46:36] <djQuery> cam: loading the css shouldnt be a problem as it should be in the head and downloaded concurtently with the rest of the page
[22:46:59] <cam> but the css load some background images
[22:47:03] <cam> what to see the website?
[22:47:10] <cam> want to see the website?
[22:47:24] <djQuery> cam: still the css file it self will be loaded.
[22:48:21] <cam> i don't know what to do
[22:49:49] <djQuery> dont use images that are too big to load quickly?
[22:50:52] <cam> the images are about 20kb only
[22:51:06] <centr0> show us the website
[22:51:53] <djQuery> <image src="whatever" onload="reportloaded"
[22:51:54] <cam> http://200.58.112.62/~camis/test/
[22:52:34] <cam> djQuery: did you see it?
[22:53:14] <djQuery> so its the 3 in the middle that are the issue?
[22:53:32] <djQuery> I dont see any other images unless the menu on the right is an image as well
[22:53:50] <cam> the images are in the css
[22:53:54] <djQuery> 'looks like they are.
[22:54:02] <cam> css loads the images for the background
[22:54:12] <djQuery> why not just do the fade in css instead of an image?
[22:54:22] <cam> djQuery this site should vi viewable from iphone and ipad :(
[22:54:46] <Sempra> ugh I can't figure out... if (cemail.indexOf("@") && cemail.indexOf(".")){ email is good } else { invalid email } - no errors, but... it isn't checking if/else properly, even the var is being set correctly. Any suggestions?
[22:54:59] <djQuery> dont know much about them, they dont support css3?
[22:55:10] <cam> can you help me to delay 3 seconds the excetution of all my jqury code?
[22:55:46] <djQuery> http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[22:56:00] <djQuery> will that site work on you iphone\ipad?
[22:56:23] <cam> i don't know :(
[22:56:44] <cam> it is fully html/css 2/jquery
[22:57:05] <cam> iphone doesn't support flash, that is why the client ask me for a html version
[22:57:41] <djQuery> cam: Web designers interested in the future of CSS have a very good reason for downloading WebKit right now. The team has introduced some astounding new CSS features that Apple is planning to release in this June‚Äôs 2.0 update to Mobile Safari for the iPhone and iPod touch. Presumably we can expect an update to the desktop version of Safari for Mac OS X and Windows around the same time.
[22:57:48] <djQuery> http://www.sitepoint.com/css-gradients-transforms-animations-and-masks/
[22:57:58] <djQuery> cam: get an iphone emulator
[22:58:16] <cam> i downloaded safari and it works perfectly
[22:58:49] <djQuery> Sempra: why not just look up a regular expression that does it allready?
[22:59:02] <djQuery> Sempra: or use <input type="email"
[22:59:15] <djQuery> Sempra: can u use see ?validation
[22:59:16] <bot-t> Sempra, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[22:59:45] <cam> what validation?
[22:59:52] <cam> i am searching a iphone emulator now
[23:00:04] <Sempra> Yeah that plugin is heavy as hell
[23:00:32] <Sempra> The reason I want to do it this way is 1) learning and 2) I will be adding more things I want to check added in the future.
[23:00:44] <djQuery> cam: I would create an array of all the images that you need then write a script that loads each one into a div that is off the page
[23:00:57] <Sempra> Everything works, except for the fact that it seems to skip the if/else
[23:01:02] <djQuery> cam: ie setting the top\left to a -999999999999
[23:01:02] <Sempra> http://pastebin.com/GTX74iX3
[23:01:43] <Sempra> No matter what email type i put in the field, it runs all the toggles
[23:02:01] <djQuery> cam: then you can register a .load on the images (hint .load dont work if the image isnt part of the dom tree )
[23:02:20] <cam> my friend, i am noob at jquery
[23:02:32] <djQuery> cam: see ?jqf
[23:02:33] <bot-t> cam, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[23:03:07] <cam> i think if i can make a delay of 3 seconds it wuold be good
[23:03:19] <cam> only for the Index where the animation is
[23:06:08] <djQuery> var imagearray = ['images\image1.gif', 'images\image1.gif'] ; var loadedcount = 0; function loaded(){ if(loadedcount === imagearray.lenght){} else {loadedcount++} } $.each(funciton(i, elm){  $('<img />', {src: elm}).load(loaded);   });
[23:06:18] <djQuery> cam: off the top of my head anyways
[23:06:57] <cam> ok
[23:07:12] <djQuery> cam: if(loadedcount === imagearray.lenght){    fancy animation code here'}
[23:08:06] <djQuery> cam: cept that I forgot to append the <img /> to the dom and set the css to left -99999999
[23:09:39] <cam> okk
[23:12:54] <djQuery> Sempra: even if you dont want that plugin. you could still grab the regex that they use in it. and just do a .match on it instead of nested if statements
[23:15:30] <Sempra> That isn't a bad idea.
[23:36:35] <Sempra> awesome regex worked perfect. Although I still don't understand the syntax for that crazy mess, I get what's going on. .match worked great. :D
[23:39:31] <Sempra> can you apply an effect to .html that fades text in, rather than load it all instantly.
[23:52:08] <hExDj> I have a SELECT, how can I find out if an option between the 1st and 3rd has been picked?
[23:52:23] <hExDj> or better yet, an option inside an optgroup
