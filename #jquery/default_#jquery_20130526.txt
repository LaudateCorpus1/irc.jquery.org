[01:54:09] <nashant> Morning guys. Cat someone tell me if I'm doing the right sort of thing here... http://tny.cz/4a7e3464  First time I'm doing something like this
[02:02:03] <nashant> Make that http://jsbin.com/igubay/1/
[02:47:55] <horrror> pretty new around here. i'm trying to fade off a div when a user scroll until almost the end of its container
[02:47:59] <horrror> any leads?
[02:48:21] <lord4163> Shouldn't this redirect me to index.html?  http://pastie.org/private/9ignsfu6dcikhryfnckmfa
[02:48:46] <lord4163> or #home I mean
[02:49:34] <systemfault> wait lol
[02:49:41] <systemfault> client-side sql? :D
[02:50:13] <systemfault> That's funny
[02:50:29] <systemfault> Thanks, you made my day
[02:50:43] <j_wright> probably not escaping the values either
[02:51:39] <horrror> j_wright: if he was it would have been funnier
[02:51:59] <lord4163> systemfault: Something bad with that? :)
[02:52:10] <lord4163> The redirection only won't work
[02:52:16] <systemfault> But seriously, this is "dailywtf"-kind-of-stuff, right :D
[02:53:08] <systemfault> lord4163: What if I drop the database?
[02:53:21] <horrror> the redirection still won't work :)
[02:53:55] <systemfault> :D
[02:54:01] <koichirose> Hello everyone. I have a masonry-like layout with a menu on the left. Clicking on menu items scrolls you to absolute positioned divs (with scrollTo). if a div is, for example, on the right edge, scrollTo won't be able to scroll there since there's no space on the right. I'd like to set the width/height of the container to the full width/height of elements + some more to be able to scroll. I hope it's clear :D
[02:55:14] <lord4163> systemfault: hmm
[02:55:59] <lord4163> systemfault: what's wrong?
[02:56:10] <systemfault> Nothing, great code bro
[02:57:45] <lord4163> systemfault: Thanks, it's still in alpha so it will become even better if you say what's wrong.
[02:58:14] <systemfault> lord4163: Well, if you leave your database wide open to the whole internet… something wrong might happen..
[03:00:04] <lord4163> systemfault: So this will be a mobile application which only is available to the employees, it will be synced with a MySQL server, this application will not be on the WWW
[03:02:10] <systemfault> Ok :/
[03:03:11] <koichirose> Here's what I meant, please click on 'Meccano'
[03:03:24] <lord4163> systemfault: you know what's wrong?
[03:03:43] <koichirose> http://jsfiddle.net/Gs8vr/1/embedded/result/
[03:07:23] <horrror> i have multiple elements using the same class. how can i access the only one visible in the window?
[03:09:04] <systemfault> horrror: IIRC, jQuery has a :visible pseudo-selector
[03:09:14] <systemfault> But imho.. using it is a code smell
[03:11:11] <horrror> systemfault: i didn't mean as visible css. i meant shown to user. e.g i have several divs classified with "wrapper" and I want that when a user reaches the end of a certain div, its child "mini-wrapper" div will be faded out
[03:15:47] <koichirose> Anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/Gs8vr/4/embedded/result/
[03:17:21] <ravenzz> horrror isn't that the same thing as visible?
[03:25:15] <motaka2> is theis wrong ?

[04:40:20] <FortuneDays> Quiick question. How can I ...increase the scope of a variable? Make it global enough to translate between two javascript files?
[04:41:58] <systemfault> FortuneDays: assign it to the global object
[04:42:05] <systemfault> In the case of a browser, it's "window
[04:42:11] <systemfault> window
[04:42:29] <FortuneDays> What would that look like?
[04:42:32] <systemfault> window.myGlobalVariable = "Hello"; // Should be accessible from everywhere.
[04:42:42] <FortuneDays> Do I have to call it from that, too?
[04:43:53] <systemfault> ?
[04:44:01] <FortuneDays> When I want to access the variable
[04:44:34] <systemfault> If the variable is not shadowed by another, you can simply do: myGlobalVariable  instead of window.myGlobalVariable
[04:45:17] <FortuneDays> Great, thanks :3

[07:23:17] <Husar> hi, how to get working alert button values? http://jsfiddle.net/ks9Ak/17/
[07:37:25] <shoky> Husar: you can't change the buttons in a confirm().. that's a native browser function, not jquery. and there's no such thing as $.alerts in jquery.. and with a form you should handle the submit event.. http://jsfiddle.net/ks9Ak/18/
[07:38:21] <Husar> Thanks shoky
[07:38:43] <shoky> i suppose you were looking at an example using an old $.alerts plugin
[07:39:36] <shoky> msafi: looks like you didn't close some quotes in your html before the script tag or something
[07:45:18] <koichirose> hrr: provide a full jsfiddle with your html, too
[07:50:49] <insel> are widgets only in jquery mobile available or in jquery too? and is there a (good) book or (chapter in a book) about this? in 2 oreilly books ('jqm' and 'jqm up and run') i found nothing about widgets.

[09:00:12] <jmmy> I really like this template http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/44368.html
[09:55:57] <darkmutt> hello jquery
[09:56:07] <abjorn> hello darkmutt
[09:57:17] <darkmutt> abjorn, may i use a minute of your time please?
[09:57:28] <abjorn> possibly
[09:57:33] <darkmutt> http://jsbin.com/unoret/1/edit please take a peek at what's happening here
[09:57:57] <darkmutt> seems to me I made some obvious mistake in the jquery but i simply can't find it out which is... irritating to say the least
[09:58:29] <abjorn> er, what's the problem?
[09:58:38] <darkmutt> well if you click on the left and right buttons
[09:58:54] <darkmutt> on the change from red to black picture and gray to black there's an obvious error
[09:59:15] <darkmutt> something i dunno for some reason toggle happens one more time then it should and messes up the entirety of the code
[10:04:05] <darkmutt> is there any kind of selector for toggled element or some way to make the one currently toggled untoggled ?XD
[10:32:17] <user_corrupt> The following page uses jQuery to post some data to a PHP emailer form via AJAX: http://www.petarivcec.com/gm/oilchange/includes/schedule.php "selection 1" posts the data successfully, but "selection 2" just doesnt work. Here is the source for that page: http://pastebin.com/ehQ4tCTC I'm a beginner, any avice much appreciated.
[10:32:40] <user_corrupt> *PHP emailer SCRIPT is what I meant to say
[10:33:13] <shoky> user_corrupt: ID's need to be unique
[10:34:24] <shoky> user_corrupt: and $('.email').val() will get you the value of the first .email element, you probably want $(this).val()
[10:34:29] <lejocelyn> I've got a strange issue, my ajax script go to check some json data. I'd like do something when the php script doesn't return any answer but it seems jquery doesn't like it
[10:34:39] <lejocelyn> what an empty json looks like ?
[10:34:46] <lejocelyn>  just {} or [] ?
[10:35:22] <shoky> empty json what? array? object? string?
[10:35:24] <shoky> lejocelyn ^
[10:35:39] <lejocelyn> object
[10:35:42] <shoky> {}
[10:35:46] <lejocelyn> ah ok
[10:35:48] <lejocelyn> I got it
[10:37:18] <darkmutt> if there's a jquery expert online (someone who has a grasp on toggling things or at least conditionals)
[10:37:20] <lejocelyn> then, if I do something like (answer is the json {} object) : if(!answer.email){// do some stuff;}  /// it shoudl be ok
[10:37:26] <darkmutt> id be very happy if you took a peek at my code here
[10:37:31] <darkmutt> http://jsbin.com/unoret/1/edit
[10:37:43] <user_corrupt> shoky: Thanks. Problem is that when I change the ID of one of the buttons, then it still does not post, I guess because the JS is set to "#submit"?
[10:38:06] <shoky> user_corrupt: you guessed right
[10:38:30] <user_corrupt> shoky: I tried changing that to ".submit" but no joy
[10:38:37] <shoky> user_corrupt: do they have a class of "submit" ?
[10:38:37] <user_corrupt> i dont know what to do at this point
[10:38:46] <shoky> .submit is for "submit" class
[10:38:57] <user_corrupt> Ill try that again
[10:39:46] <shoky> user_corrupt:  you can't have 2 class attributes.  for multiple classes:   class="class1 class2 class2"
[10:40:08] <shoky> er last one should be class3 ;p
[10:40:41] <user_corrupt> go figure, seems to be doing what i want it to do now
[10:40:42] <user_corrupt> thanks
[10:41:11] <shoky> user_corrupt: yes but now your class="email" is not really adding the class
[10:42:09] <user_corrupt> shoky: I dont understand, its posting values that are unique to each button
[10:42:17] <user_corrupt> now
[10:43:54] <user_corrupt> shoky: I guess I can just delete "class=email" from the buttons now?
[10:44:59] <shoky> user_corrupt: if you're not using that class anywhere, sure
[10:45:23] <user_corrupt> shoky: thanks again
[10:45:28] <shoky> user_corrupt: its posting those different values because of $(this).val()
[10:45:34] <shoky> user_corrupt: $(this) is the clicked button
[10:53:30] <mikef> im evaluating the plugin at http://layout.jquery-dev.net are there any other similar plugins out there?
[10:53:44] <mikef> *for layouts
[10:59:17] <banister`shop> anyone here used gridster.js ? what are the units for size it uses? i know how big my divs are in pixels, but not in whatever units it wants..
[11:06:18] <tw2113> according to the plugin's source file, it's using px as well
[11:20:35] <shoky> darkmutt: not really sure why, but :nth-child() is selecting 2 elements sometimes.  use .eq() instead:  http://jsbin.com/unoret/13/edit
[11:28:02] <shoky> darkmutt: ah i see why.. because that clip effect wraps the image in a div
[11:28:15] <darkmutt> does what?
[11:28:16] <darkmutt> O.o
[11:28:26] <shoky> darkmutt: that's how it achieves the effect
[11:28:39] <shoky> for the duration of the animation there's a wrapping div
[11:28:56] <darkmutt> ooooooh
[11:28:57] <darkmutt> but wait
[11:29:01] <darkmutt> i waited for the animation to wait
[11:29:06] <darkmutt> to end i mean
[11:29:07] <darkmutt> many times
[11:29:09] <shoky> no you didn't
[11:29:18] <shoky> you're calling .toggle('clip')  twice on each button click
[11:29:30] <shoky> to hide the previous image, and to show the new one
[11:29:31] <darkmutt> oh wait... thats how
[11:29:39] <darkmutt> and the counting gets messed up
[11:29:44] <shoky> use .eq() ;]
[11:29:57] <darkmutt> what's eq though first time i saw it gotta google :D
[11:30:11] <shoky> ?eq
[11:30:11] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[11:30:49] <darkmutt> though should it really have mattered with me using a class?
[11:31:09] <shoky> yes
[11:31:15] <shoky> because you were using :nth-child
[11:31:19] <shoky> and the DOM was:
[11:31:40] <shoky> <img/> <div><img/></div>  <img/> <img/> <img/>
[11:31:52] <shoky> so those first 2 images are both  1st-child
[11:32:13] <shoky> so nth-child(1)  would select both of them
[11:32:18] <darkmutt> mhmmm
[11:33:57] <darkmutt> thank you very much for both the answer and the explanation shoky :)
[11:34:17] <shoky> yer welcome ;]
[11:37:27] <banister_> tw2113: thanks, but check out the example on gridster.net http://cl.ly/image/2D460U000u1H
[11:37:39] <banister_> it's "data-sizey=1" etc, it's def. not 1 pixel though..
[11:39:09] <tw2113> check the source for where those values are grabbed, and see what's appended to it
[11:39:24] <tw2113> i didn't see any rem or em's in the source
[11:39:28] <tw2113> just px
[11:46:31] <banister_> tw2113: seems like it's in 'rows' and 'cols' (those are teh units)
[11:48:47] <tw2113> then it probably calculates what it does based off that
[11:48:52] <tw2113> some sort of math
[11:49:54] <banister_> tw2113: strangely i see no explanation of the size of rows/cols anywhere in the docs
[11:50:20] <tw2113> i never said documentation, i said source :P
[11:57:27] <banister_> tw2113: can you 'figure it all out' for me? :D
[11:58:38] <tw2113> no
[12:16:03] <webstormer_> is there a name for the design pattern that jquery uses?
[12:25:12] <banister_> webstormer_: jquery is a huge framework that uses a tonne of design patterns, which one are u referring to
[12:26:54] <tw2113> object orientated programming?
[12:27:00] <xhoy> hahahah
[12:27:35] <tw2113> i know objects are a core concept to js :P

[13:19:47] <foucist> axscode: well you'd detect with jquery but since it's already creating it.. there's no need to ?
[13:20:56] <axscode> foucist: another script was changing it, so i need to have another.
[13:21:52] <axscode> that script is part of existing module of cms, so whle doing its thing wanted to add additional without touching the module.

[14:23:26] <banister_> anyone here experienced with gridster ?
[14:32:43] <hugo_moss> ive posted a fiddle if anyone wants to help on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16763866/why-does-this-callback-not-unbind-itself-to-transitionend-after-completing-one-a
[14:54:05] <shoky> hugo_moss: look at the docs for .one():  If the first argument contains more than one space-separated event types, the event handler is called once for each event type.
[15:05:10] <rosieres> Hi. How do I select items from an array where the chosen items are smaller than the index No.
[15:05:11] <rosieres> EG [foo, bar,es,list,not] is my array and I have the index No. 3 so I want all elements from 1 - 3 .... didn´t find the right search term on google
[15:14:32] <shoky> rosieres: .slice()
[15:14:51] <shoky> if i understood ya
[15:16:30] <rosieres> shoky: slice strips from the beginning of the array
[15:18:21] <rosieres> shoky: slice(3) strips the first 3 items . . . but I want to select the first 3 . . . think this is my way -> for (var i = actImg; i < imagePos.length; i++) {theImg += imagePos[i] << 0;}
[15:19:16] <rosieres> or am I wrong ?
[15:20:28] <shoky> rosieres:  slice(0, 3)
[15:22:13] <rosieres> Damn ! - Thanks !

[16:25:22] <Imaginativeone> oh
[16:25:27] <Imaginativeone> That is pretty sweet.
[16:25:49] <leenug> yeah, we want to embed it ontop of all our clients websites, it will then post back to backend
[16:25:49] <Imaginativeone> you're making your own plugin?
[16:26:02] <leenug> possibly, if thats the best solution
[16:26:20] <Imaginativeone> ah - sorry.  Still learning.
[16:26:29] <leenug> I've seen companies like olark use a single script like: http://olark.com/embed/{clientID} - and we want to replicate that functionality
[16:28:52] <vst332> http://jsfiddle.net/gbyGg/118/   Yay finally working for chrome, firefox, and opera!
[16:31:56] <vst332> can some one have a look in Internet explorer 10 ? i only have 9 installed
[16:32:47] <vst332> internet explorer aged 10 .. when chrom is 23 lol
[16:33:42] <vst332> firefox is still in kindergarten
[16:35:26] <bambanx> guys anyone can recommend me a  slider can support big sites like 200 images , maybe using some kind of lazy loading pattern or some...  and with video mp4 support? i was checking html5box but i think dont support large sites....
[17:01:07] <patstoms> morning
[17:01:32] <patstoms> is there any jquery plugin for some gallery image slider where to store many, many images?
[17:01:40] <rosieres> can somebody kick my brain, why my fiunction isn´t called a click event ? http://jsfiddle.net/wgkdc/2/
[17:01:54] <patstoms> I think - that plugin is not loading all images on the page load, just some...
[17:04:53] <meingrosserfreun> when adding an event listener to an object via $(document).on("event", "selector", function() {});
[17:05:33] <meingrosserfreun> shouldn't the event fire when calling $("#idOfElement").trigger("event");
[17:05:58] <meingrosserfreun> the selector is a css class that #idOfElemt has
[17:06:21] <meingrosserfreun> event in my case beeing "change"
[17:06:50] <HarryPitfall> afaik, on will see the event triggered by code...
[17:06:58] <HarryPitfall> so, yes
[17:07:16] <HarryPitfall> but I remember trouble with $(document).on()
[17:07:29] <meingrosserfreun> anything specific?
[17:07:33] <HarryPitfall> try $('body').on()
[17:07:58] <meingrosserfreun> will do... thx
[17:10:13] <rosieres> Stripped down to a 6 liner -> even  console.log() isn´t called within click() -> http://jsfiddle.net/wgkdc/4/
[17:12:50] <FortuneDays> I need to figure out how to make these the same thing: http://i.snag.gy/NaH4S.jpg
[17:12:56] <HarryPitfall> rosieres: id="#nextImg"
[17:13:00] <HarryPitfall> no no no no
[17:13:03] <HarryPitfall> id="nextImg"
[17:13:16] <rosieres> maaannn FUCK THE DUCK ! .. .Thanks !
[17:13:25] <madprops> i'm trying to send a string through POST to the server. I pass it to Json.Stringify yet it seems to malform the request
[17:13:32] <madprops> I'm using $.post
[17:13:37] <FortuneDays> One of them is a click bind returning $(this), the other is the same object found through a $('.class') selector
[17:13:39] <madprops> maybe I should use $.ajax?
[17:14:35] <HarryPitfall> send a string to the server?
[17:17:54] <madprops> HarryPitfall: it's a dictionary
[17:18:09] <madprops> nested with other dictionaries
[17:18:21] <HarryPitfall> do you have control about how to receive the data on server?
[17:19:15] <madprops> yes but the server doesn't seem to be the problem, I'm not sending it correctly from the client. Instead of having one post request sent I have multiple requests because the dictionary structure is somehow messing things up
[17:20:25] <madprops> this is how i'm sending it http://scrot.it/327
[17:21:11] <HarryPitfall> $.get will send the information to $_GET (if is php in the backend)
[17:21:12] <madprops> this is what i'm sending on state http://scrot.it/328
[17:21:31] <HarryPitfall> is too long to get
[17:21:36] <HarryPitfall> for get method
[17:21:58] <HarryPitfall> i don't remember now, but there is a limit for get sends
[17:31:19] <madprops> I tried with $.post too
[17:32:38] <madprops> look how it sends stuff http://scrot.it/329
[17:33:14] <madprops> notice the ?name lines
[17:36:47] <meingrosserfreun> concerning my trigger(event) problem... $('body') doesn't seem to solve it either
[17:36:55] <meingrosserfreun> maybe i got something else mixed up
[17:36:58] <meingrosserfreun> hmm
[17:38:20] <JBlitzen> I have an img tag inside a div tag.  I'm in a jquery event where "this" is the div tag.  How do alert the corresponding img tag's id?
[17:40:38] <JBlitzen> alert($(this).children("img:first").attr("id"));
[17:40:41] <JBlitzen> That says undefined
[17:42:37] <meingrosserfreun> in the head-section of my page i have put $(document).ready(function(e) {}) inside of that i try to bind the event "change" to a css class selector via $('body').on("change", ".classSelector", function() {}) and since i need it to be called once after the page finishes loading i put a $('#elementID').trigger('change') which is after the bind of the change event but still inside the document.ready
[17:42:37] <meingrosserfreun> part
[17:42:58] <meingrosserfreun> am i trying to do something that is doomed to fail?
[17:44:15] <meingrosserfreun> as i mentioned "#elementID" has the classSelector that i bind the change event to
[17:44:46] <meingrosserfreun> it fires when i change it manually after the page has loaded... but not on itself
[17:49:07] <meingrosserfreun> @JBlitzen have you tried :nth-child(1)
[17:49:33] <JBlitzen> alert($(this).children("img:nth-child(1)").attr("id")); ?
[17:49:43] <meingrosserfreun> yes
[17:49:54] <JBlitzen> Undefined
[17:50:10] <JBlitzen> alert($(this).html());  correctly shows the img tag in there
[17:50:21] <JBlitzen> And it appears in the browser so it's well formatted
[17:50:37] <JBlitzen> This is some jquery syntax thing I don't get, how to select within a context of $(this)
[17:52:11] <JBlitzen> OH
[17:52:18] <JBlitzen> alert($('img',this).attr('src'));
[17:52:21] <JBlitzen> That worked
[17:52:30] <JBlitzen> Thought I tried it, maybe I was using $(this) instead of this
[17:52:49] <meingrosserfreun> hm
[17:52:56] <banister_> JBlitzen: lol
[17:53:04] <meingrosserfreun> well, as long as it works ^^
[17:53:09] <banister_> JBlitzen: i remember u from #c on undernet, from about 15 years ago
[17:53:53] <JBlitzen> Nice, hi banister
[17:54:02] <JBlitzen> I'm still on unet, though #C++ and #VC++ have basically shut down
[17:54:17] <banister_> yeah, freenode is where it's at for programming channels these days
[17:54:58] <banister_> JBlitzen: you still a microsoft-head or have you embraced the ways of *nix already?
[17:55:17] <JBlitzen> No, I like to be productive, so I'm still a microsoft fan
[17:56:52] <meingrosserfreun> i can hear the thunder of a lightning going through a *nix'lers heart
[17:57:26] <JBlitzen> Haha
[17:57:34] <JBlitzen> Here's a question
[17:57:49] <JBlitzen> My div with an image is draggable
[17:57:54] <JBlitzen> It's set to clone
[17:58:09] <JBlitzen> When I change the image source during the drag, "this" refers to the original div, not the clone
[17:58:13] <JBlitzen> How do I refer to the clone?
[17:58:22] <JBlitzen> In draggable.start
[18:01:58] <JBlitzen> Ah
[18:02:00] <JBlitzen> ui.helper
[18:02:01] <JBlitzen> Easy enough
[18:04:21] <JBlitzen> Works!  All set, thanks!
[18:04:32] <meingrosserfreun> have a nice day/night you all... have to go to bed...
[18:04:46] <meingrosserfreun> @JBlitzen good to hear
[18:04:50] <meingrosserfreun> bye
[18:05:05] <banister`shop> what was the solution?
[18:05:24] <JBlitzen> alert($('img:first-child',ui.helper).attr('src'));
[18:05:27] <JBlitzen> $(ui.helper).children("img").attr('src', $('img:first-child',ui.helper).attr('src').replace("thumbnail", "image"))
[18:05:54] <JBlitzen> The :first-child is unnecessary, but the .children call was necessary because the div is also resizable, and the image it uses as a handle was also getting switched
[18:06:10] <JBlitzen> first-child did nothing to prevent that, but children worked
[18:06:29] <JBlitzen> Not sure whether I want to resize the clone as it's being dragged to the full image size, but leaning against it
[18:06:39] <JBlitzen> I know how to do that, at any rate
[18:07:47] <JBlitzen> Wow, haha, it's great to see an application start to come together.  I can get distracted just playing with this thing
[18:10:36] <FortuneDays> Hrm. I'm having a bit of a problem. I want to use a variable to select the array's key.
[18:10:52] <FortuneDays> ie, 'colors[index].copyMode' where copyMode = hexclean
[18:11:04] <FortuneDays> When I actually type 'hexclean' where 'copyMode' is, it works fine
[18:11:08] <FortuneDays> but it returns undefined otherwise.
[18:11:29] <FortuneDays> I'm probably doing something really wrong with this methodology, but I'm hoping you have some sort of idea
[18:13:42] <FortuneDays> oh
[18:13:45] <FortuneDays> colors[index][copyMode] worked just great
[18:13:48] <FortuneDays> ^.^ didn't expect that
[18:20:56] <JBlitzen> nice
[18:41:06] <user_corrupt> I use the following block of code to control the attributes of iframes that I open with fancybox: http://pastebin.com/TW1533Ke I'm trying to use that code to control the attributes of an iframe that I am programatically opening in fancybox here: http://pastebin.com/ygAbw3YN line 39 is the line of code that is opening my iframe, but Im not able to control its attributes for some reason...
[18:42:28] <user_corrupt> the site can be viewed live here: http://www.petarivcec.com/gm/oilchange/rebuilt/ and the page in question can be found by waiting for the odometer to reach 5k, clicking yes, and selecting a button (the thank you page that the pops up is what I am trying to work on)
[18:49:33] <paul_uk> hey guys, I'm loading in https://www.google.com/jsapi after document.ready.  but when i execute: google.load('visualization', '1', {'packages': ['geomap']}); the whole DOM disappears and all I get left with is 2 script tags and a style tag and a white screen.  anyone seen this behavior before?  thanks
[18:50:24] <ckknight> Anyone know if there are any plans for jQuery's promises to be Promises/A+ compliant?
[19:05:38] <SpacyK> Hi all! I'm trying to figure out how a certain website does this scrolling graphic. I've inspected the code and just can't figure it out... I did see that it's one graphic that automatically scrolls in a div inside the page. the page is here: http://playgroundinc.com/work/magellan-vacations/
[19:05:55] <SpacyK> about half way down the page they have a frame where a graphic scrolls automatically and then a header bar pops up
[19:05:57] <SpacyK> any ideas?
[19:13:55] <unnu> anyone here?
[19:14:44] <shoky> SpacyK: css3 animation
[19:15:24] <SpacyK> shoky: thank you! I'll take a look.
[19:16:12] <unnu> so
[19:16:15] <unnu> uhmmm
[19:16:19] <unnu> ill just linky pastebin
[19:16:31] <unnu> and hopefully one of you guys can read through my mess of code
[19:16:45] <unnu> but i am hitting a wall and getting frustrated because google is no helps
[19:17:27] <unnu> http://pastebin.com/x47M0KQB
[19:17:35] <unnu> im seriously gunna stab something
[19:17:39] <unnu> okay
[19:17:39] <unnu> so
[19:18:04] <unnu> after you load new content on the page via jquery's ajax call how do you get the javascript back into the dom for the new content?
[19:18:19] <unnu> is it the way i did it or is that horrendously wrong
[19:18:27] <ss23> "how do you get the javascript back into the dom" doesn't make sense to me, but uh
[19:18:44] <ss23> unnu: If you bind with .submit and .click, it only does the current items in the DOM
[19:18:49] <ss23> If you then replace a bunch of content, you'll need to re-bind
[19:19:03] <unnu> check out the patebin link
[19:19:51] <unnu> or this one
[19:19:52] <unnu> http://pastebin.com/u8AibV6c
[19:19:56] <unnu> tried it both ways
[19:26:34] <unnu> anyone?
[19:28:52] <shoky> unnu: here's one way http://jsfiddle.net/gChwe/1/   and here's a nicer way with event delegation: http://jsfiddle.net/gChwe/2/
[19:32:54] <unnu> okay, ill try to work around that
[19:33:29] <unnu> its a post page from an old website where you can post a picture with some data about it, it used 8 pages of php to do it and i thought i could turn it into 2
[19:33:47] <unnu> one to display the html and the other to parse the ajax
[19:52:22] <unnu> thanks shoky
[19:59:39] <unnu> how would i designate the file in the form?
[20:00:37] <unnu> <input name="myPic" type=
[20:00:52] <unnu> "file" />
[20:19:52] <user_corrupt> im using javascript:parent.$.fancybox.open to programatically open an iframe, but I'm unable to control the attributes of that iframe with the following block of code: http://pastebin.com/TW1533Ke im new to JS/jQuery and any advice at all is very much appreciated.
[20:25:57] <user_corrupt> heres the source of the whole page by the way:
[20:25:58] <user_corrupt> http://pastebin.com/ygAbw3YN
[20:26:37] <user_corrupt> line 39 is where i invoke the fancybox iframe
[21:07:20] <Wolfed> Hey guys. Wondering if someone can give me a hand with this: http://jsfiddle.net/jMDg8/
[21:07:40] <Wolfed> I need to fetch each .qty, but its giving me all of them. Can't quiet figure it out
[21:09:12] <Cork> Wolf_22: don't use id as data storage
[21:09:15] <Cork> use data-id
[21:09:42] <Cork> and why don't you just do $('.claimt .qty').each() ?
[21:09:55] <Wolfed> hum
[21:10:03] <Wolfed> Ok. noted the first thing. and
[21:10:18] <Wolfed> Not sure if by any chance and changes to the dom, people would change the order of things
[21:10:35] <Wolfed> Thats why I thought .each'ing '.claimt' was better
[21:11:21] <Cork> $.each(function() { var id = $(this).closest('tr').data('id'); var qty = parseFloat($(this).text()); }
[21:11:51] <Wolfed> I guess that could work. lol
[21:11:52] <Cork> also i would prob use map instead of each
[21:12:02] <Wolfed> I'll give map a look.
[21:12:06] <Wolfed> Thanks for the suggestion
[21:12:48] <Cork> var citems= $.map($('.claimt .qty'), function(elm) { return citem { id:  $(this).closest('tr').data('id'), qty: parseFloat($(this).text()) }; });
[21:12:57] <Cork> Wolfed: ^
[21:13:07] <Cork> opps
[21:13:18] <Cork> var citems = $.map($('.claimt .qty'), function(elm) { return citem { id: $(elm).closest('tr').data('id'), qty: parseFloat($(elm).text()) }; });
[21:13:26] <Wolfed> heehee
[21:13:48] <Wolfed> Ah I get it I think
[21:13:59] <Cork> and the citem in the function shouldn't be there >_<
[21:14:10] <Cork> damn i suck at copy paste today :/
[21:14:31] <Wolfed> lol
[21:14:32] <Cork> var citems = $.map($('.claimt .qty'), function(elm) { return { id: $(elm).closest('tr').data('id'), qty: parseFloat($(elm).text()) }; });
[21:14:34] <Cork> there
[21:16:45] <Wolfed> Thanks a lot.
[21:16:53] <Cork> np
[21:19:41] <unnu> can someone help me select a form in my html?
[21:20:29] <Cork> unnu: ask the question instead for someone
[21:20:47] <unnu> okay
[21:20:51] <unnu> what am i doing wrong here
[21:20:59] <Cork> ?p
[21:21:00] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:27:09] <unnu> http://pastebin.com/8S9ftvQA
[21:27:14] <unnu> i went with pastebin
[21:27:15] <unnu> my bad
[21:28:30] <Cork> ajax expects a hash, array or a string
[21:28:39] <Cork> try using ?.serializeArray
[21:28:44] <Cork> ?.serializeArray
[21:28:44] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[21:28:51] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/bBQQU/
[21:28:54] <unnu> okay
[21:30:56] <unnu> debugger says forminfo.seralizeArray is not a function
[21:31:20] <unnu> and i should read my own shit
[21:31:21] <unnu> lol
[21:31:24] <unnu> mystype
[21:31:32] <Cork> $('form').serializeArray()
[21:34:16] <user_corrupt> when I open an iframe with fancybox with the following bit of code, I am unable to control its attributes: javascript:parent.$.fancybox.open({href : 'includes/thankyou.php', id: 'thanky', type: 'iframe'}); does anyone know a better way to make that a div that I could target?
[21:35:18] <user_corrupt> here is the full source of what im doing: http://pastebin.com/ygAbw3YN line 39 is where I trigger the iframe, and 13-25 is the code block that Im trying to use to control its attributes
[22:22:02] <asher^> is anyone aware of why .width() can return 0 on elements that have width set to auto, and how to get around this?
[22:24:32] <Cork> asher^: an element doesn't get a calculated width until it's been through the browsers "reflow", and this happens when it's appended to the dom
[22:24:43] <Cork> additionally display: inline; element doens't have a width
[22:24:51] <Cork> so it's one of those two
[22:25:24] <asher^> ok, its display:inline
[22:25:35] <Cork> change it to display: inline-block;
[22:25:41] <asher^> hmm, the inspector in chrome shows its actual width and height though
[22:25:57] <maahacka> asher^: there was something like client-width
[22:26:12] <maahacka> which displays the true width on the screen
[22:26:22] <asher^> .clientWidth gives me 0 also
[22:27:12] <asher^> hmm, even changint it to inline-block hasnt helped
[22:27:53] <Cork> is the element added to the main dom?
[22:28:08] <asher^> yeah
[22:28:31] <Cork> could you try reproduce it in jsfiddle?
[22:29:14] <asher^> sure, its an element produced by highcharts, so im guessing theres something going on in there that is causing an issue
[22:34:25] <unnu> var forminfo = new FormData($("form#addform")[0]); isn't sending my form to $_Post on the php side, any ideas ?
[22:34:41] <asher^> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/ngdDF/
[22:35:11] <asher^> the second .highcharts-grid' has a definite width and height, but returns 0 still
[22:36:45] <asher^> maybe because its svg?
[22:37:34] <Cork> ah svg
[22:37:39] <Cork> might be
[22:42:35] <Cork> asher^: ya, i really don't have a good answer why theres no computed values for that element
[22:44:19] <Cork> asher^: only thing i can tell is that the browsers all do the same thing...
[22:45:42] <Cork> asher^: you might be able to ask in #svg or something
[22:45:57] <tw2113> g'day Cork
[22:46:20] <asher^> Cork, just found it, .getBoundingClientRect().width
[22:46:21] <Cork> 'morning
[22:46:40] <asher^> that gives it, but one pixel off
[22:47:47] <Cork> asher^: this one looks a little scary actually http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#the-getclientrects-and-getboundingclientrect-methods
[22:48:10] <Cork> especially "changes to the underlying document are not reflected in the objects."
[22:48:43] <unnu> var forminfo = new FormData($("form#addform")[0]); isn't sending my form to $_Post on the php side, any ideas ?
[22:49:01] <Cork> unnu: still like i said; don't use FormData
[22:49:11] <Cork> use serializeArray
[22:49:51] <Cork> FormData gives a dom class back and $.ajax expects an object array or a string
[22:50:12] <Cork> *object, array or a string
[23:20:51] <Wolfed> .closest goes up the tree, right? o.o
[23:36:46] <enerel> hi guys http://jsfiddle.net/GYUBt/ why image hover change extension does not work?
[23:40:17] <enerel> helloo
[23:40:29] <enerel>  http://jsfiddle.net/GYUBt/ why image hover change extension does not work?
[23:40:47] <enerel> tried also $(this).src.replace('.png','.jpg');
[23:42:44] <Cork> enerel: http://jsfiddle.net/GYUBt/1/
[23:43:23] <Cork> you can't replace based on a variable that doesn't exist
[23:43:57] <Cork> $(this).attr('src', $(this).attr('src').replace('.png','.jpg')); would also work
[23:46:07] <enerel> thanks Cork
[23:46:25] <enerel> what will happen if i want fade effect
[23:46:39] <Cork> you can't fade from one source to another
[23:46:46] <Cork> you would have to use two img tags
[23:46:51] <Cork> and style opacity
[23:46:54] <enerel> i see
[23:52:12] <enerel> Cork how about this? http://jsfiddle.net/GYUBt/3/
[23:53:54] <enerel> Cork got it http://jsfiddle.net/GYUBt/5/
