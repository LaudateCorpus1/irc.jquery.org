[00:09:32] <fattest> Cork, I got the the two tables to work, but now my jquery show hide isn't working....http://jsbin.com/peyomome/3/edit
[00:10:15] <Cork> fattest: you removed the show hide code
[00:10:48] <fattest> Cork: oh whoops, i forgot to add it to the jsbin.
[00:10:56] <fattest> Cork: whats with the \ at the top of the page though, i can't remove it
[00:11:13] <Cork> in your header
[00:11:19] <Cork> after angular
[00:11:29] <fattest> yes
[00:11:35] <fattest> if i remove it, the code stops executing
[00:11:42] <fattest> i get no output
[00:13:31] <Cork> no idea
[00:13:41] <Cork> but ya, that is strange
[00:13:50] <Cork> try w3c validate
[00:43:11] <mehrdad> hello
[00:43:29] <mehrdad> does anyone know how can i populate jqgrid dropdown manually ?
[00:44:13] <fattest> Cork: I still can't figure it out. I uploaded the web page on a simple hosting site, http://google.fhost.us/index.html and with w3 validator, im getting 36 issues
[00:44:23] <fattest> Cork: on the plus side, my show hide is working
[00:45:35] <Cork> fattest: to start with add <!doctype html>
[00:45:44] <fattest> ok
[00:46:14] <fattest> Cork: i added it
[00:47:12] <Cork> secondly i think you need to add <![CDATA[ ]]> around your template data
[00:47:17] <Cork> so the browser doesn't parse it
[00:48:17] <fattest> Cork: like this? http://jsbin.com/peyomome/5/edit
[00:48:31] <Cork> no
[00:48:41] <Cork> <![CDATA[ <-- start
[00:48:48] <Cork> ]]> <-- end
[00:49:15] <Cork> also always have your link and style tags before script tags
[00:50:12] <fattest> Cork: http://jsbin.com/peyomome/5/edit
[00:50:29] <Cork> ugg
[00:50:49] <Cork> fattest: then move the tag to the bottom of the form
[00:50:51] <Cork> and not in head
[00:50:55] <Cork> uh..
[00:50:59] <Cork> *bottom of the body
[00:53:15] <fattest> Cork: done http://jsbin.com/peyomome/5/edit
[00:54:05] <Cork> uh....
[00:56:40] <fattest> problem?
[00:58:03] <Cork> fattest: http://jsbin.com/peyomome/7/edit
[00:58:33] <Cork> fattest: and when your at it add thead and tbody :)
[00:59:14] <xec> you're
[00:59:17] <xec> :D
[01:00:32] <fattest> why
[01:00:56] <Cork> fattest: well cause they belong there
[01:01:09] <Fishbowne2> anyone know how to make jquery-ui drag work on an ipAD /
[01:01:10] <Fishbowne2> ?
[01:01:15] <Fishbowne2> and Android ?
[01:01:38] <Cork> fattest: hmm there is still a syntax error somewhere i see
[01:02:34] <Cork> ah
[01:02:44] <Cork> no it's just the plugin using invalid attributes :/
[01:03:11] <Cork> Fishbowne2: there is a plugin you can include that adds the support
[01:03:33] <xec> Fishbowne2: http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[01:03:46] <xec> i haven't tried it myself though
[01:03:51] <Cork> i have
[01:04:00] <Cork> it works well
[01:04:09] <Cork> well as well as you can expect
[01:04:20] <Cork> as you can't have hover so those can't be fixed
[01:07:17] <Fishbowne2> thats pretty slick.
[01:07:30] <Fishbowne2> xec, it works GREAT
[01:07:38] <Fishbowne2> just "integrates" with jquer-ui
[01:07:47] <Fishbowne2> pretty freakin' fab!
[01:07:59] <xec> :)
[01:08:23] <Fishbowne2> downloaded, linked, and boom... works on an ipad!
[01:08:25] <Fishbowne2> no coding.
[01:08:44] <Fishbowne2> I mean my coding that I wrote for the web just "works" now on a tablet
[01:08:49] <Cork> Fishbowne2: it binds touchstart/end and fakes the events jquery expects
[01:09:44] <Fishbowne2> its magic and unicorns!
[01:10:05] <Fishbowne2> seriosuly, thats pretty amazing for just linking to a js script
[01:11:24] <mehrdad> anyone?
[01:11:37] <mehrdad> is there a jqgrid channel around here?
[01:19:37] <xec> mehrdad: i doubt it. if you make a demo with what you have so far, with a detailed explanation of what you're trying to achieve, someone might be able to help
[01:51:30] <Jacta> Does anyone know a slider that contains more elements pr slide with good responsiveness abilities?
[01:51:32] <mehrdad> almost sorted most of it it out
[01:57:09] <Danny> Hey guys whats up? I need a bit of help.. Im searching for a solution to calculate the height of an scaled image. The image is scaled by the width property of the img-tag. Actually i have the solution by resizing the window but i need it by window.load... any help?
[01:57:10] <Danny> http://jsfiddle.net/Jx6ub/
[02:01:17] <Rodael> Danny: I'm pretty sure you can't read the height of an image before it is actually rendered on the page.
[02:02:09] <Danny> Rodael: So have I another option?
[02:05:03] <Rodael> Danny: Do you need the height before you're showing the image?
[02:06:21] <Danny> Rodael: Will be the best solution.. yep.
[02:07:13] <Danny> Rodael: But not coactive..
[02:07:15] <Jacta> btw - looking for a bannerslider - not slider-slider :)
[02:09:07] <Rodael> Danny: Then something like this is probably the best way: http://jsfiddle.net/jeykeu/HZPkm/1/
[02:19:10] <Danny> Rodael: The problem is I cant write something in the doc after its loaded cause i need the scaled height from nivo-slider
[02:23:11] <Danny> Rodael: Maybe take a look what i mean. http://goo.gl/w4v592 is the site im working on.. I need the scaled height from the image before the site is complete loaded to set the header wrappers height.
[02:29:53] <yannickoo_> hey guys, can anybody of you tell me why the "Maximum call stack size exceeded" because of this script here? http://pastebin.com/5Tbgm89q
[02:31:53] <nFFF> Guys debugging someones code, and there's a custom event called qElement.trigger({type: 'fabric_change'... // yet no where in the code is there .on('fabric_change')
[02:31:57] <nFFF> am I missing something?
[02:32:05] <xec> yannickoo_: most likely it's not because of that code (at least not on its own)
[02:32:14] <Cork> yannickoo_: it means you have something recursing and it loops for too long
[02:32:32] <xec> yannickoo_: perhaps you have a click event listener triggering another click event or something like that
[02:32:34] <yannickoo_> Cork: sure but when comment that part out everything is fine :/
[02:32:52] <xec> maybe a syntax error near that part?
[02:33:06] <Cork> yannickoo_: are you doing trigger('click') or .click() anywhere?
[02:33:24] <yannickoo_> Cork: found a cool piece in the code: $('#page').bind('click', function() {        if ($('#menu').css('right') == '0px') {          $('#menu-trigger').trigger('click');        }      });
[02:33:32] <yannickoo_> i think everything is clear now...
[02:33:33] <Cork> there you go
[02:33:39] <Cork> but don't dump code in the channel
[02:33:54] <xec> :)
[02:33:59] <Cork> yannickoo_: #menu-trigger is most likely a child of #page
[02:34:05] <Cork> so your creating an event loop
[02:34:20] <xec> you're
[02:34:38] * Cork rips ' from his keyboard
[02:34:44] <xec> :D
[02:35:01] <Cork> shit... how am i to create strings now...
[02:35:07] <xec> use "
[02:43:19] <txdv> is there a possible way to get an event attached which gets called whenever does an append on a certain element?
[02:45:13] <Cork> no
[02:45:30] <Cork> there is MutationObservers
[02:45:37] <Cork> but those aren't cross browsers yet
[02:45:48] <Cork> ?mdn mutationobserver
[02:45:50] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[02:46:24] <Cork> txdv: the reason there isn't any events is cause those are very expensive
[02:46:50] <Cork> cause they need to keep that state of the old element as it bubbles up
[02:50:14] <nFFF> Guys debugging someones code, and there's a custom event called qElement.trigger({type: 'fabric_change'... // yet no where in the code is there .on('fabric_change')
[02:50:23] <nFFF> how else could the event be triggered?
[02:50:43] <antiPoP> hi, I have the following selector:                             $('#bg', self).val(item);
[02:51:02] <antiPoP> work fine in ffox/chrome but gives an error in ie. Why ?
[02:51:17] <Cork> nFFF: are you sure there is any code listning for it?
[02:51:43] <Cork> antiPoP: what's the error?
[02:52:21] <nFFF> ah found it, its inlined in some html
[02:52:44] <nFFF> when is it ever a good idea to inline js code? :|
[02:52:58] <Cork> there isn'
[02:53:03] <Cork> *t
[02:53:04] <antiPoP> Cork: SCRIPT65535: Invalid calling object
[02:53:21] <Cork> antiPoP: sounds like self in undefined
[02:53:44] <seutje> antiPoP: only if ur google or the likes
[02:53:52] <seutje> errr nFFF*
[02:54:21] <antiPoP> cork did console.log(self) and it's an object
[02:54:42] <Cork> antiPoP: and what is item?
[02:55:00] <antiPoP> let me see
[02:56:55] <antiPoP> cork console.log outputs an function, although it should be just an string
[02:57:16] <Cork> antiPoP: that is most likely the cause
[02:57:40] <txdv> Cork: I just need Webkit
[02:58:27] <txdv> need it in
[02:59:27] <antiPoP> Cork:  item is defined as                             item = $(this).data('value').trim();
[02:59:42] <seutje> I sense somebody fucking with ur Array.prototype or something
[03:00:09] <Cork> antiPoP: there is no such function in jquery
[03:00:22] <Cork> jquery has $.trim() not $().trim()
[03:00:43] <seutje> data('value') returns a string though
[03:00:53] <seutje> or could
[03:01:01] <Cork> hmm
[03:01:05] <Cork> antiPoP: what version of ie?
[03:01:25] <antiPoP> ie11
[03:01:30] <Cork> hmm
[03:02:08] <Cork> do ie11 inspector let you find where a function is defined?
[03:02:15] <Cork> never tried that in it
[03:02:34] <mehrdad> i don't think so
[03:02:47] <mehrdad> need to ctrl+F it
[03:02:59] <antiPoP> Cork.. I don't know.. I usually develop with firebug
[03:03:03] <Cork> and that will only work if it has a name
[03:03:28] <Cork> antiPoP: you could try console.log(item.toString())
[03:03:38] <Cork> hopefully it gives you the content of the function
[03:04:24] <antiPoP> let me see
[03:07:26] <antiPoP> Cork   function item() {   [native code]   }
[03:07:36] <Cork> AHA
[03:07:43] <antiPoP> remving trim seems to work
[03:07:44] <Cork> antiPoP: rename the variable
[03:07:53] <antiPoP> but in the previous line i have trim() and works proeprly
[03:07:57] <antiPoP> ok
[03:08:00] <Cork> item uses something that ie defines
[03:08:31] <Cork> i just love how html can define random variables in js
[03:08:33] <Cork> ...
[03:10:40] <antiPoP> yes, was that, now works
[03:10:45] <antiPoP> Cork:  thanks
[03:10:56] <antiPoP> why ie uses such name publicly?
[03:11:06] <Cork> antiPoP: it isn't just ie
[03:11:20] <Cork> you get bitten by things like this from time to time in all browsers
[03:12:42] <antiPoP> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6435677/ie-javascript-and-item-as-a-variable-name
[03:12:47] <antiPoP> I see
[03:13:08] <antiPoP> not a good practice... it took a while to find this...
[03:13:24] <antiPoP> and it's something you don't learn somewhere...
[03:14:26] <Cork> antiPoP: an example http://jsfiddle.net/6k4Ds/
[03:14:52] <Cork> antiPoP: ya, this is one of the things i HATE about the dom
[03:15:01] <Cork> but it is legacy and needed for many old pages
[03:15:04] <Cork> so they can't remove it
[03:15:33] <Cork> antiPoP: but basically any id you have on the page becomes global variables
[03:15:48] <Cork> there is a few other gotchas too
[03:18:52] <antiPoP> Cork: so, if I have an id called "item", I can't use it as variable in my code then?
[03:19:08] <Cork> antiPoP: you can if you define the variable
[03:19:18] <Cork> but yes it is a bit risky
[03:19:34] <Cork> if you make sure to define all variables you use you should be fine
[03:20:35] <antiPoP> so should I use var then?
[03:20:51] <Cork> always
[03:20:56] <antiPoP> it's safer var x = 1 that just x =1 ?
[03:21:01] <Cork> yes
[03:21:04] <Cork> much
[03:21:27] <xec> if you omit the "var", x will bleed out to the top level scope (global)
[03:21:28] <Cork> but you just need to do it for the first time you use the variable in a scope
[03:21:32] <antiPoP> ok, I didn't nknew that... and I have searched a lot of times for the var ussage..
[03:21:42] <Cork> antiPoP: x = 1; is basically the same as window.x = 1;
[03:21:46] <antiPoP> this is something I didn't found
[03:22:00] <Cork> unless you use strict mode
[03:22:03] <Cork> where it is an error
[03:22:38] <Cork> so yes, i can recommend using "use strict";
[03:22:46] <Cork> it saves your variable sanity :)
[03:23:10] <xec> +1 for "use strict"; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode
[03:24:14] <xec> why does mdn have such long urls, why not mdn.com/js/strict_mode
[03:24:15] <xec> :P
[03:25:11] <antiPoP> very interesting, thanks :)
[03:25:23] <Cork> xec: it's part of the new scheam to make it irrelevant
[03:26:41] <xec> scheme?
[03:27:28] <Cork> ya
[03:27:31] <xec> make what irrelevant? as in strict mode is default on? or new url scheme for mdn?
[03:27:40] <Cork> mdn
[03:27:57] <Cork> if you haven't noticed a lot of useful info is getting removed from mdn
[03:28:06] <xec> oh?
[03:28:07] <Cork> and is replaced by pointless babble
[03:28:42] <Cork> quite often i have to jump from mdn to the specs to find things like call arguments for functions and things like that :/
[03:28:49] <Cork> where the old pages had it
[03:29:14] <xec> really? that's absurd
[03:29:18] <Cork> ya
[03:29:22] <Cork> freekingly annoying too
[03:29:35] <Cork> luckely there is version history in mdn
[03:29:47] <Cork> but when they change the url the history is lost though :/
[03:29:53] <Cork> so some pages is just gone
[03:30:05] <txdv> how do I chained selects with an explicit function? $('article').select('a').attr('href')?
[03:30:21] <xec> .find()?
[03:30:34] <Cork> txdv: you can't unless the function is built for it
[03:30:35] <txdv> yeah
[03:30:50] <txdv> always forget that it is called find
[03:30:57] <xec> $("article a") is the same as $("article").find("a") - if that's what you meant
[03:31:00] <txdv> thanks
[04:12:04] <steveccc> hi all - does the jquery ui datepicker output a different format of date to the value than it displays?
[04:40:09] <nFFF> Im seeing: jQuery('#option_values_list_<?php echo $_option->getId(); ?>') in a .phml file
[04:40:28] <nFFF> how is this working? :\
[04:40:30] <nFFF> mixing hp/js
[04:40:33] <nFFF> php*
[04:42:09] <Uhkis> nFFF: browser sees that as jQuery('#option_values_list_1)
[04:42:17] <Uhkis> (assuming the id is 1)
[04:44:41] <nFFF> cool got you
[04:44:55] <nFFF> is the syntax correct (having php inside qoutes) ?
[04:46:17] <Uhkis> php is not in quotes there
[04:46:32] <Uhkis> just add php snippet where ever you need it
[04:48:45] <fattest_> How do i sort the table by name (ascending) automatically on page load? http://jsbin.com/moxenoci/11/edit
[04:55:26] <fattest_> sorry, wrong link http://jsbin.com/peyomome/14/edit
[04:59:05] <seutje> fattest_: docs suggest ng-init="predicate = 'name';" and a quick test makes it appear to work as expected
[04:59:38] <fattest_> seutje: where are the docs for this?
[05:00:17] <seutje> http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngInit
[05:00:46] <seutje> just execute what the sorter executes on init
[05:01:46] <fattest_> seutje: so where should i add it in my table?
[05:02:31] <seutje> don't think it matters, as long as the scope is right, I slapped it on the div with the ng-controller defined on it
[05:02:49] <seutje> it just sets an initial value for that scope
[05:02:51] <seutje> afict
[05:02:53] <seutje> afaict
[05:03:06] <seutje> but I've never used angular, I'm just reading docs out loud here
[05:03:21] <fattest_> oh ok
[05:23:33] <tocka> hi guys, I have multiple fields that are being generated by jquery (you press a button and a new field gets generated), how could I check which field is being edited when?
[05:23:42] <tocka> I tried
[05:23:44] <tocka> $('.field_quantity').bind('input', function() {
[05:23:55] <tocka> and then get the id of the current field
[05:23:58] <tocka> but it doesnt work:/
[05:39:47] <hawb> Hey guys trying to do something really simple can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong: http://jsbin.com/pinolope/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[05:40:16] <hawb> When you mouse over the very first word: "Peter", it should effect the image
[05:40:23] <hawb> im pretty lost though
[05:45:32] <maxorator> hawb, you're missing )}; from the end
[05:45:37] <xec> hawb: include jquery. then check the warnings (you never end the .ready({... )
[05:45:39] <maxorator> oops, });
[05:48:15] <hawb> Thanks maxorator , does including the }); at the end make the JS Bin do anything for you?
[05:48:35] <hawb> it still doesnt seem to be working is all
[05:48:40] <Cork> hawb: http://jsbin.com/pinolope/3/edit
[05:49:14] <Cork> your border css syntax was wrong
[05:49:24] <Cork> but you should also move it to the css
[05:49:34] <hawb> Ah awesome
[05:49:40] <hawb> THanks so much to all three of you
[05:49:44] <maxorator> yeah, use addClass/removeClass
[05:50:14] <xec> the border syntax was fine
[05:50:21] <xec> (when i looked at it at least)
[05:50:28] <Cork> 5px red solid?
[05:50:37] <Cork> should be 5px solid red
[05:50:52] <xec> doesnt matter
[05:50:58] <xec> http://jsbin.com/pinolope/4/edit
[05:51:10] <Cork> hmm so it doesn't
[05:51:34] <Cork> ah
[05:51:36] <xec> but i do agree using classes is much better :)
[05:51:56] <Cork> the old one set it on $(".featured-image")
[05:52:08] <hawb> oh yeah oops!
[05:52:12] <Cork> totallt missed that
[05:52:42] <Cork> so THAT was the cause :D
[05:53:24] <airdem> how can i select multiple jq object variables? $(a, b, c) does not seem to work
[05:53:24] <xec> on /4 all i did was include jquery and put }); at the end
[05:53:46] <Cork> airdem: a.add(b).add(c)
[05:53:48] <xec> but since its jsbin it might have been different when hawb first posted it
[05:54:36] <Cork> airdem: if they are jq objects, you don't need $()
[05:54:47] <airdem> thank you Cork
[05:58:58] <hawb> Just a question about using the addClass, if that element already has a class assigned to it, say for columns in a grid, will that stop it the jquery from doing its thing?
[05:59:11] <Cork> no
[05:59:24] <Cork> addClass adds the classes in the string to the element if it isn't already there
[05:59:33] <Cork> and remove removes the mentioned classes
[05:59:40] <Cork> none of them touches other classes on the element
[05:59:52] <Cork> (that is why you use it instead of className)
[06:01:26] <hawb> ah ok, just trying to figure out why this isnt working on a wordpress install, might have to link it in a second
[06:07:22] <hawb> Cork would you mind having a look at this http://samuelmitchelldesigns.com/hunterelectrics/ and this http://pastebin.com/NsWnNy25 and seeing if you can see anything?
[06:07:47] <hawb> the relevant jquery is at the very bottom of that pastebin
[06:07:58] <Cork> hawb: you can't use !important in inline style
[06:08:33] <Cork> hawb: and you have the code twice
[06:09:36] <hawb> oh oops I didnt realise that part was still in there :S
[06:10:46] <xec> actually, you can have inline !important. in fact, that's the only way to override an external !important
[06:11:00] <xec> it is a good idea? absolutely not :)
[06:11:03] <hawb> is anything else standing out that could be preventing it from functioning like it did in the js bin?
[06:12:55] <xec> hawb: on that page, where is the script? what's the filename and where is it included?
[06:17:24] <hawb> xec: I thought I was including it with this function: wp_register_script( 'bones-js', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/library/js/scripts.js', array( 'jquery' ), '', true );
[06:17:36] <hawb> and then enqueing it
[06:17:54] <xec> that looks messy, is that wordpress?
[06:18:07] * xec is suddenly glad he doesn't have to deal with wordpress
[06:19:00] <hawb> yeah wordpress indeed
[06:19:07] <xec> hawb: i just right clicked -> view source on your page, and i didn't find anything called scripts.js
[06:19:14] <hawb> hmm
[06:19:49] <hawb> maybe I should try just linking it in the header and seeing what happens?
[06:20:09] <xec> yeah but make sure it's after jquery
[06:23:15] <hawb> sigh this is way too confusing
[06:24:24] <hawb> its weird that I can get jquery stuff working on this site with the same bones theme: http://samuelmitchelldesigns.com/portfolio/
[06:25:23] <xec> hawb: for what it's worth i can see two scripts.js on that page ;D
[06:25:40] <hawb> ah hah well thats something to go an at least
[06:25:53] <xec> you can use chrome dev tools -> sources to see the scripts included on a page btw
[06:26:28] <xec> does it work if you do a simple <script> instead?
[06:29:54] <hawb> hmm I'll try that again in a second
[06:30:45] <hawb> you said you saw two script.js files on the portfolio page?
[06:32:00] <murosai_> what's the recommonded way to send ajax form-multipart requests?
[06:32:11] <murosai_> is there some library i should use?
[06:33:12] <xec> hawb: yes, just do view source and ctrl+f
[06:33:52] <xec> scripts.js*
[06:34:19] <hawb> ok I'll try some more later thanks so much for the help man
[06:37:39] <ankurk_> Suppose I want to wrap <a> tag around $(this).text()? How would I do that?
[06:38:55] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Is the text just text?
[06:39:19] <ankurk_> It's actually text in a table column
[06:39:34] <ankurk_> So I am using $(this).text()
[06:39:41] <BillCriswell> Got ya.
[06:40:16] <BillCriswell> I'd probably do $(this).html(function(i, html){ '<a href="#">' + html + '</a>'; });
[06:40:32] <ankurk_> I tried using this, http://jsfiddle.net/45M3k/ but it didn't work
[06:41:50] <ankurk_> what if I don't want to write HTML? :P
[06:42:34] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: $(this).wrapInner('<a href="#"></a>'); would also do what I did.
[06:42:37] <BillCriswell> Never needed ot do that.
[06:43:41] <ankurk_> let me try
[06:43:43] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: http://jsbin.com/hodejizo/2/edit?html,css,js,output
[06:43:56] <ankurk_> jsbin eh? :P
[06:44:29] <BillCriswell> I always use jsbin.
[06:45:14] <ankurk_> I though you were a fiddle guy
[06:45:28] <BillCriswell> Nope.
[06:45:38] <BillCriswell> Only use fiddle if a problem is presented on it.
[06:45:45] <BillCriswell> If I'm doing something from scratch I use bin.
[06:52:39] <ankurk_> This thing is quite handy, https://github.com/yuanyan/pragmatic-jquery
[06:57:43] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Yeah, seems well put together.
[06:58:04] <BillCriswell> I need to learn to use git better.
[06:58:25] <ankurk_> Me too, it's a good skill actually
[06:58:35] <ankurk_> we more of these guides
[06:58:37] <ankurk_> *need
[06:58:41] <BillCriswell> Yeah, many would deem it essential haha
[06:59:15] <ankurk_> haha
[06:59:40] <ankurk_> Why this Ajax call is stored in variable? http://jsfiddle.net/m8kfY/
[06:59:51] <ankurk_> https://github.com/yuanyan/pragmatic-jquery#async-programing
[07:00:20] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: You could do more stuff to it later is the only reason I could think of?
[07:00:42] <BillCriswell> You could do like jqxhr.done(function() { // More shit to do when done });
[07:00:59] <ankurk_> oh
[07:01:13] <ankurk_> that might be the reason
[07:05:07] <Snoopal> hey guys. im using $.post() it works really fine in chrome and i get a result. But in safari or firefox i only get 0 as response? can´t see what the difference should be?
[07:05:51] <fossxplorer> Do i need to create a JS function to get an arrow that appears after some scrolling to allow users to click to top, e.g like on http://themefuse.com/demo/wordpress/cloudhost/?
[07:05:55] <SageChaozu> For the guy that was trying to wrap <a> anchor tags around his div. I updated your JsFiddle. Check it out http://jsfiddle.net/YHKzV/10/
[07:06:10] <airdem> http://jsfiddle.net/wGBLZ/1/ this throws a json parse error but the same string turns to be valid in http://jsonlint.com/ any suggestions?
[07:06:12] <SageChaozu> It was ankurk_ I believe
[07:06:19] <airdem> *turns out
[07:06:24] <BillCriswell> fossxplorer: Yes.
[07:06:38] <BillCriswell> Pretty trivial though.
[07:07:09] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell, ok, will give it a try :)
[07:07:12] <SageChaozu> ankurk_ I could not use append and prepend since the <a> would automatically close its tag. So I had to just fill up a variable with the HTML and then empty and reappend it.
[07:07:40] <shoky> airdem: it's because jquery automatically parses the JSON for you and turns it into an object. no need to parse it again
[07:07:44] <SageChaozu> I think a final thing to do is to actually remove the event handler when you click so it does not continue forever.
[07:08:05] <ankurk_> SageChaozu: I actually went with this http://jsfiddle.net/QnQLj/
[07:08:06] <shoky> airdem: that is, .data() returns it as an object already
[07:08:22] <murosai_> i'm a bit confused about same-origin-policy, if i load an external script from my page and the script executes some ajax calls then is the 'origin' where the script was loaded or the site that loaded the script?
[07:08:36] <airdem> shoky, thank you
[07:09:07] <ankurk_> Since I just had to replace the text and initialize a popover on it
[07:09:17] <SageChaozu> and ankurk_ I just realized the JS Fiddle did not update. Here is the updated version http://jsfiddle.net/YHKzV/12/
[07:09:28] <SageChaozu> Forgot to click update, LOL
[07:09:31] <NiGhTTraX> how can you prevent events from bubbling up when dragging using the jquery ui draggable? e.g. if I start dragging on a clickable element I don't want the click event to be fired at the end
[07:10:05] <SageChaozu> ohhhh, I thought you were just trying to instantly make text a link
[07:10:48] <airdem> shoky, is it because i used the data-json attribute or is jquery always trying to identify and parse a string as json?
[07:11:00] <BillCriswell> fossxplorer: I coded it up if you get stuck cause I wanted to make sure I was thinking about ir right.
[07:11:38] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell, cool, thx. Trying out now.
[07:12:07] <murosai_> im reading about XSS vulnerabilities but i don't understand how they can work given same-origin-policy
[07:16:38] <Snoopal> hey guys. im wondering what the right syntax is for $('fo').on('hover',function(){}) <- how do i trigger hoverIn and hover out?
[07:18:21] <BillCriswell> Snoopal: Use mouseenter and mouseleave.
[07:18:50] <BillCriswell> $('foo').on({ mouseenter: function () { /* I am on foo */ }, mouseleave: function () { /* I am off foo */ });
[07:19:24] <Snoopal> oh didn´t know that this works so too :)
[07:19:27] <Snoopal> nice and thanks :)
[07:20:28] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:21:08] <Genesis_> http://jsfiddle.net/xF4LD/
[07:21:17] <Genesis_> could someone tell me how I could make this function take in an argument?
[07:21:26] <Genesis_> the document ready method?
[07:21:36] <Genesis_> I am new to JS, would I just add the two argument fields within the ()?
[07:21:46] <Genesis_> how would I call it?
[07:22:01] <Snoopal> i added new dom through an ajax call. but now my hovereffects do not work. I tried to use $('foo').on{mouseenter: etc. but it does not trigger on the newly added items. any suggestions?
[07:25:11] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell, i have an issue with my "scroller" just works on the main index.html. I've included the html code for the arrow in my footer which is included for all pages.
[07:27:57] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell, nvm, console is my friend
[07:29:42] <BillCriswell> fossxplorer: Haha.
[07:29:57] <fossxplorer> :)
[07:30:40] <Genesis_> http://jsfiddle.net/xF4LD/1/
[07:30:47] <Genesis_> could someone tell me what I am doing wrong here?
[07:30:56] <Genesis_> TextGetter(helloworld, testdiv); isn't working when I call it
[07:31:26] <BillCriswell> Snoopal: You would need to use event delegation.
[07:32:00] <BillCriswell> Snoopal: http://jsbin.com/golakefa/1/edit?html,js,output is what I was thinking.
[07:32:10] <BillCriswell> Snoopal: I wanted to make sure the events bubble.
[07:33:28] <Snoopal> hmm
[07:34:13] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: You'd just define TextGetter in the document ready.
[07:34:35] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: So wrap the entire conents inside the document ready
[07:34:36] <fossxplorer> http://pastebin.com/azSyJmda BillCriswell, why does it complain over js/jquery.scrollTo.js 404 (Not Found)  for all expect the main site?
[07:34:37] <Genesis_> in a function?
[07:35:33] <BillCriswell> fossxplorer: Not familiar with scrollTo plugin. This is what I came up with though: http://jsbin.com/fitinibu/1/edit?css,js,output
[07:35:47] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: You don't have to.
[07:36:31] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: could you show me how to fix this? I don't quite get what you mean.
[07:37:06] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell, can i see the code in action there?
[07:37:21] <BillCriswell> fossxplorer: Yeah, it should show you the css and js
[07:38:22] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell, ah there is no HTML of course to test it :)
[07:38:33] <BillCriswell> fossxplorer: Click the "HTML" tab at the top.
[07:38:58] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: http://jsbin.com/wavetixa/1/edit?html,js,output essentially this.
[07:39:16] <fossxplorer> Yeah and Output :) now i see it. Thx!
[07:39:20] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell ^
[07:39:35] <BillCriswell> fossxplorer: That should have been visible off the bat.
[07:39:40] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:40:04] <Snoopal> BillCriswell: i know change it to $('body').on('mouseenter','.tile',function() {}); and same for mouseleave <- works perfect now
[07:40:08] <Snoopal> thank you for your help! :)
[07:40:11] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell, ok :)
[07:41:12] <BillCriswell> Snoopal: Sweet.
[07:41:16] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:42:15] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: Not everything needs to happen inside a document ready, only things that require the document to be read, like manipulating the dom.
[07:44:26] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: Thank you, so in the .html I would only do the document ready call to a seperate .js file
[07:44:36] <Genesis_> my only issue is that when I do the call, it keeps saying TextGetter is not defined
[07:45:46] <BillCriswell> I'd have to see your code.
[07:46:22] <Genesis_> let me fix formatting :)
[07:48:19] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/zofuzogo/1/
[07:49:03] <BillCriswell> Getting a 404 error there.
[07:49:12] <BillCriswell> When I try to click "Edit" to see it.
[07:49:49] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: http://jsbin.com/wavetixa/2/edit?js,console
[07:50:32] <Genesis_> why the hell isn't it working on mine
[07:51:03] <nFFF> <div id="hai" data-foo="bar"> // $('#hai').prop('data-foo') should return 'bar' ?
[07:51:40] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell, i've copied your code into my plugins.js, but it's not firing :(
[07:52:04] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: I have alerts setup for debugging
[07:52:20] <Genesis_> its passing the two arguments over, but it isn't inserting it into the div.
[07:52:25] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell,no errors in console so do i need to call it?
[07:52:56] <BillCriswell> fossxplorer: That would need to run when the document is ready. Do you have it wrapped in that?
[07:53:47] <shoky> nFFF: no, either .attr('data-foo') or .data('foo')
[07:54:52] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/D4r3x/
[07:54:53] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: You have to look at the console and see if there's errors. Make sure the file is being requested and everythign.
[07:54:56] <Genesis_> am I missing something?
[07:55:01] <Genesis_> no errors in console either
[07:55:17] <Genesis_> I have alerts setup as you can see there for the 2 arguments, and they print the correct values
[07:55:24] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: There's no "text" data type.
[07:55:25] <Genesis_> but it isn't inserting the text into the div in the html
[07:55:32] <BillCriswell> Try "html"
[07:55:34] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell, now i have it  and works :) Now i need to understand your code. Will study it abit tomorrow. Thx a lot!
[07:55:40] <BillCriswell> or just remove it.
[07:55:46] <BillCriswell> Let jQuery figure it out.
[07:55:54] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: Done, still not inserting it.
[07:56:10] <Genesis_> console is clean
[07:57:02] <shoky> Genesis_: why the hell are you using jquery 1.2.6
[07:57:08] <shoky> statusCode option was added in 1.5
[07:57:33] <BillCriswell> Are you sure insertdiv is a valid selector? Are you sure textfile is a real file? Is the request being made in the network tab?
[07:57:42] <Genesis_> which version of jquery should I be using?
[07:57:50] <shoky> there is a "text" dataType, btw
[07:57:57] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: its all local, and insertdiv is a valid selector to my knowledge
[07:58:01] <Genesis_> and textfile is a real file.
[07:58:06] <BillCriswell> shoky: Doesn't say that in the docs. =(
[07:58:06] <shoky> Genesis_: the newest one ideally
[07:58:07] <Genesis_> when it was all a single document
[07:58:10] <Genesis_> within the document ready
[07:58:12] <Genesis_> it was "working"
[07:58:20] <BillCriswell> Oh, yes it does... just in a different place.
[07:58:21] <fossxplorer> BillCriswell, one last thing: if fades in and out, but nothing happens on click though. Nothing in console.
[07:58:23] <shoky> BillCriswell: "text": A plain text string.
[07:58:35] <BillCriswell> shoky:  (default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html)) is what I was looking at.
[07:58:54] <shoky> ah
[07:59:00] <shoky> that's the default ;p
[07:59:16] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: The alerts return valid files back
[07:59:26] <Genesis_> and helloworld.txt has content within it, I just checked
[07:59:30] <Genesis_> and another program is using it right now
[07:59:32] <Genesis_> and printing it fine
[07:59:35] <fossxplorer> http://pastebin.com/iVWpR235 BillCriswell
[07:59:41] <BillCriswell> shoky: Ah
[08:00:07] <fossxplorer> Btw, can i have multiple $( document ).ready(function() { ?
[08:00:49] <BillCriswell> fossxplorer: Not sure why that wouldn't work. You can have multiple readys.
[08:01:03] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: Check $(insertdiv).length
[08:02:18] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: 0, so I assume its a path issue or something?
[08:02:37] <nFFF> Main= { Functions: { setFilterPart: function(arg) { } } } // how to call setFilterPart?
[08:02:46] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: That means your selector is bad.
[08:03:08] <BillCriswell> Are you passing like '#element-id' or just 'element-id' ?
[08:03:23] <Genesis_> I am passing 'testdiv'
[08:03:27] <peey> Are there any other libraries that perform similar functions as jquery animate? ( I just want to smoothly transition element width, position, etc.)
[08:03:28] <Genesis_> where testdiv is the div name
[08:03:30] <BillCriswell> That's the issue then.
[08:03:38] <Genesis_> how would I pass it?
[08:03:39] <BillCriswell> Why do your divs have names?
[08:03:55] <Genesis_> BillCriswell: Because I want a cetain file to be inserted into a specific div.
[08:03:55] <BillCriswell> That's a class on your div.
[08:04:09] <BillCriswell> .testdiv is what you'd want to pass it.
[08:04:11] <b-ot> BillCriswell: wanttopassit.com - ☺ AVAILABLE
[08:04:24] <BillCriswell> Haha
[08:04:28] <Genesis_> oh my god
[08:04:30] <Genesis_> I am retarded
[08:04:31] <Genesis_> of course
[08:04:36] <BillCriswell> I agree a little bit.
[08:04:43] <Genesis_> sorry BillCriswell: thanks for your help
[08:04:50] <BillCriswell> Hahahh no problem.
[08:04:50] <vcarney> How would you trigger a click event on a link where event.preventDefault() has been triggered?
[08:04:57] <BillCriswell> Just kidding by the way lol
[08:43:23] <Kamuela> I know there are XSS issues with JSON across domains, but what about site.com using app.site.com. Do subdomains still have this issue?
[08:45:08] <PhonicUK> is there a method that keeps going up through parents until a given selector is matched?
[08:45:27] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery parents
[08:45:29] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .parents() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/parents/
[08:46:40] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela subdomains are technically different.
[08:47:05] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela it needs to be the same protocol, domain, and port.  none of those can differ.
[08:47:24] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: anything else is jsonp then?
[08:47:52] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela err, jsonp is a way to work around cors problems, not an alternative to.
[08:50:13] <duch_kazatel> PhonicUK did that link help?
[08:50:45] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: is there a more official way to deal with CORS?
[08:50:52] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean.
[08:52:22] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: i guess i'm not sure what i mean either. haha i'm trying to use jquery to transmit form data from a landing page hosted separately from my meteor app
[08:52:51] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela do you have control over the server(s) at play?
[08:53:11] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: yes both. i'm separating them to skip having to statically serve the landing page
[08:53:56] <duch_kazatel> then why not setup CORS?
[08:54:28] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: I think that's what I meant to ask with my last question about "official way." so what would i be doing?
[08:54:39] <duch_kazatel> !g enable cors
[08:54:41] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: enable cross-origin resource sharing → http://enable-cors.org/
[08:54:44] <duch_kazatel> :)
[08:55:04] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: thank you
[08:55:07] <duch_kazatel> that site has instructions for most platforms.
[08:55:36] <PhonicUK> duch_kazatel, just needed the method name, didn't know there was parents() as well as parent() :)
[08:55:42] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[08:58:00] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: ok i think i will host the static stuff with a node process and then use CORS on ExpressJS
[09:12:19] <BillCriswell> Damn, really quiet in here today.
[09:12:23] <duch_kazatel> right?
[09:12:52] <BillCriswell> I helped a shit load of people earlier, hasn't been much since then.
[09:14:59] <zagaza`> hi.. think anyone can help me out with my little issue? the masonry grid breaks when you press about and then back to latest post.. however it doesnt break when you press browse posts and then back to latest post.. it's because about is another page.. url/about.. anyone know how I could save the javascript from breaking despite that? http://danielnikolovski.com/
[09:21:40] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: who know if a storm is coming? :P
[09:21:59] <Jacta> How to set this? $(this).css({ transition-delay: '1s' }); - seems wrong
[09:22:12] <Jacta> i want to set it with javascrpt
[09:22:31] <BillCriswell> Jacta: quote it or do transitionDelay
[09:22:48] <BillCriswell> 'transition-delay' or transitionDelay
[09:22:56] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Haha
[09:24:04] <BillCriswell> Jacta: I think you'd be better off doing that in CSS and switching out classes.
[09:25:24] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell is right - avoid editing CSS - modify classes instead.
[09:25:47] <Jacta> BillCriswell, what if the user only have access to an data-attribute with the seconds in?
[09:26:07] <Jacta> The user needs to be able to change the delay from that
[09:26:16] <BillCriswell> Jacta: Might be able to use attr(data-delay)
[09:26:28] <BillCriswell> Would have to try that out though?
[09:26:53] <duch_kazatel> Jacta then $(this).css('transition-delay', $(this).data('delay) + 's');, if the delay value is just the number
[09:26:56] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:27:16] <PhonicUK> why is $(".class").each(function(){...}) cycling through the same element multiple times?
[09:27:18] <BillCriswell> Damn, didn't work.
[09:27:32] <Jacta> BillCriswell, :/ Thanks duch_kazatel
[09:27:58] <CrowX-> if I have opened www.example.com/somePathName  how can I dynamically change the url to www.example.com/anotherPathName  without redirecting there?
[09:28:00] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/yadifexa/1/edit?html,css,output this could have been sweeeet
[09:28:15] <CrowX-> I can successfully do it if the pathname is a hash, via window.location.hash
[09:28:19] <CrowX-> but I would like to do it without hash
[09:28:28] <duch_kazatel> ph1 i'd have to see your javascript.
[09:28:31] <duch_kazatel> err, PhonicUK
[09:28:45] <PhonicUK> sec, putting a test together
[09:29:01] <decx> CrowX- history pushstate
[09:29:12] <CrowX-> i.e. if the '#someHash' part of example.com/#someHash can be accessed/changed through window.location.hash, how can the 'noHash' part of example.com/noHash be changed?
[09:29:14] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- history.replaceState() will replace the current url without generating a history entry.
[09:29:37] <duch_kazatel> history.pushState() will change the url and insert a new entry in history.
[09:29:56] <CrowX-> isn't there any variable for the pathname, in a similar way to window.location.hash?
[09:30:05] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- nope.
[09:30:13] <decx> it's called location ;)
[09:30:22] <duch_kazatel> you can edit window.location, but that will take the browser to the new location./
[09:30:28] <PhonicUK> duch_kazatel, http://meeting.cubecoders.com
[09:30:36] <CrowX-> k
[09:30:37] <CrowX-> thanks
[09:30:49] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- http://caniuse.com/history as an fyi.
[09:31:03] <duch_kazatel> PhonicUK err, can you please just setup an example on jsfiddle instead?
[09:31:10] <PhonicUK> I can't reproduce it in a fiddle unfortunately
[09:31:26] <PhonicUK> but it's definitely cycling through the same element multiple times
[09:32:03] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/tD4Ec/
[09:32:11] <duch_kazatel> even sharing just the javascript would be helpful.
[09:32:39] <PhonicUK> http://pastebin.com/bKxvPZBJ
[09:32:51] <CrowX-> i'll just leave it with hashtags then
[09:32:55] <CrowX-> it's much simpler
[09:32:59] <PhonicUK> there's "pushBack", and "pushBackN" (n being 1 to 5)
[09:33:02] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- pushstates are pretty easy.
[09:33:21] <PhonicUK> so what i'm trying to do is for each element, increase "n" by one, remove the old pushBackN and add the new one
[09:35:01] <decx> you can just use the each index fyi
[09:35:24] <duch_kazatel> do that, or cache your selector instead.
[09:35:27] <PhonicUK> decx, they're not in order
[09:36:20] <duch_kazatel> PhonicUK so something will have classes pushBack AND pushBack1, for example?
[09:36:43] <PhonicUK> yes,
[09:36:59] <Deviad> Hello, does anyone use nivoslider?
[09:37:06] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Deviad
[09:37:06] <b-ot> Deviad: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:37:20] <Deviad> I am using its thumbnail gallery and I need to place two arrows to go back and forth through the thumbnails in the div
[09:37:21] <PhonicUK> its part of a menu system, if it has .pushBack then its color gets changed, and increasing values of pushBackN push it further to the right
[09:38:01] <duch_kazatel> PhonicUK i'd use a for loop and/or cache the selector and see if that helps.
[09:38:15] <PhonicUK> I don't see how caching the selector helps in this case?
[09:38:21] <PhonicUK> i'm not going over the same element multiple times
[09:39:22] <PhonicUK> infact I already am
[09:39:26] <duch_kazatel> just tossing out ideas.  i don't know what the rest of your code looks like or what it's doing, so i'm providing suggestions for things to attempt.
[09:40:24] <decx> how does it manifest itself that you think each goes over the same element multiple times?
[09:40:39] <duch_kazatel> ^^ that was going to be my next question
[09:40:47] <PhonicUK> I can see the ID of the item going past, and its the same one twice
[09:40:58] <PhonicUK> and there's not anything daft like two elements with the same ID
[09:41:54] <PhonicUK> I wonder if this is a bubbling issue...
[09:42:08] <duch_kazatel> is this each running off an event handler of some kind?
[09:42:19] <PhonicUK> yes
[09:42:36] <PhonicUK> gonna check if the handler is firing multiple times
[09:42:53] <duch_kazatel> do a e.stopImmediatePropagation() on that sucker ;)
[09:43:36] <PhonicUK> that's done it :D
[09:43:42] <duch_kazatel> cool.
[09:43:45] <BillCriswell> Condoleezze Rice joined Dropbox's Board of Directors... This doesn't seem real?
[09:44:03] <duch_kazatel> PhonicUK how many items is that each running over?
[09:44:25] <PhonicUK> only 3 or so in my case
[09:44:36] <duch_kazatel> mmk.
[09:46:34] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell yeah something seems... interesting about that.
[09:49:22] <decx> seems like a great time to get into private hosting again
[09:50:13] <decx> my host partner is already targeting ads on relevant sites
[09:50:37] <decx> made a mint from the nsa news
[09:50:52] <decx> "keep your data safe in germany on your own server"
[09:52:20] <Jacta> anyone into http://www.sequencejs.com/ ?
[09:54:38] <decx> forget sliders, the new way to let clients easily set up multiple things on their frontpage are gridbased drag&drop apps on the backend to set up magazine style layouts
[09:55:23] <decx> better conversions, more content meat for seo, more flexibility
[09:57:17] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha, nice.
[09:59:12] <decx> i've set something like this up for a client and they love it, and now there's actual clickthrough to all the stuff that was lost in everything but the first slide
[10:02:43] <Jacta> What about you, BillCriswell, dont you know around everything :P
[10:03:08] <BillCriswell> I wish I knew even 5% of everything.
[10:08:18] <BillCriswell> Jacta: I am not familiar with this.
[10:09:13] <decx> the sequence.js themes are 95% css
[10:09:50] <decx> ask specific questions about implementation here on in #css and don't wait for experts
[10:09:58] <decx> or in*
[10:12:23] <ajustrun> does anyone use retina.js? im having an issue where im specifying data-at2x but its not using the 2x file
[10:15:18] <duch_kazatel> helluva day so far at work though.
[10:26:42] <decx> i had to google how to delete dropbox account because it's nowhere in the account ui to be found
[10:29:20] <ankurk_> decx: why deleting your account?
[10:29:35] <duch_kazatel> probably has to do with rice getting added to the board.
[10:30:27] <decx> actually i just noticed that i hadn't used it in a year, condi was jsut a catalyst to my decision ;)
[10:30:36] <duch_kazatel> hah, fair enough.
[10:31:40] <decx> and it's always interesting if there's a feature to delete your account in anything where you can make an account
[10:32:35] <decx> for example the official way to delete your account from skype is to change all personal information and then never log in again
[10:32:52] <duch_kazatel> which is an awful way to do that, imo.
[10:33:05] <decx> not just imo ^^
[10:33:10] <duch_kazatel> :D
[10:34:52] <Jacta> BillCriswell, what is  -webkit-transition-duration named?
[10:35:01] <Jacta> if I need to set it :)
[10:35:06] <duch_kazatel> Jacta in css?
[10:35:13] <Jacta> jquery :)
[10:35:24] <decx> if you set transition with css the prefixes get added automagically
[10:35:24] <duch_kazatel> .css('-webkit-transition-duration', 'value') should work btw
[10:35:37] <decx> css()*
[10:35:37] <duch_kazatel> also that.
[10:35:58] <BillCriswell> Quote it or camelCase it.
[10:43:00] <ankurk_> I respect the guy who compiled this badass list, https://github.com/dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks
[10:43:38] <duch_kazatel> bookmarked.
[10:44:42] <Uhkis> forked
[10:45:46] <Jacta> BillCriswell, camelCase it?
[10:46:00] <BillCriswell> webkitTransitionDelay
[10:57:36] <ankurk_> Damn BillCriswell was right, it's so silent in here.
[10:57:44] <duch_kazatel> kind of spooky.
[10:58:38] <duch_kazatel> i'm almost done deprecating $.browser out of our codebase.  finallyyyyyyyy
[11:01:40] <BillCriswell> Hmm... just noticed something I launched recently isn't doing what I thought it was. Haha
[11:01:43] <BillCriswell> That's not good.
[11:03:15] <BillCriswell> Close enough I guess.
[11:03:29] <duch_kazatel> what was it?
[11:03:49] <BillCriswell> http://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/interactive-flag-html5/
[11:03:50] <Gnosis> Hi. What does it mean if you do $(function() {...}) ?
[11:04:00] <duch_kazatel> Gnosis that's like document ready.
[11:04:02] <BillCriswell> Gnosis: It's short for document ready basically.
[11:04:52] <Gnosis> ah, so the same as onLoad?
[11:04:55] <duch_kazatel> no.
[11:05:01] <duch_kazatel> the same as on ready
[11:05:07] <Gnosis> okay, got it
[11:05:16] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: There's a lot I'm not too crazy about with it, but it's not resizing the the flag properly for whatever reason now.
[11:11:23] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[11:14:19] <decx> why are some selection cirlces filled and others not?`
[11:14:29] <decx> oh wait those are the ones that got clicked
[11:15:01] <Spami> So, I have this big variable https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5f3f3f6c6d58098168c3 and I'd like to not put it in my file but include it dynamically. Any idea how to do that ?
[11:15:06] <decx> they are all doing a little dance when you drag the flag
[11:15:28] <duch_kazatel> Spami ajax or JSONP
[11:15:56] <Spami> duch_kazatel, but how to Is use it after ? Ajax is going to return a string
[11:16:05] <Spami> not arrays of objects
[11:16:19] <decx> you can return anything you want
[11:16:28] <Spami> ah, how ?
[11:16:30] <decx> what you do with the data is up to you
[11:16:48] <duch_kazatel> don't wrap the data with quotes.
[11:16:54] <duch_kazatel> there's your data.
[11:17:18] <duch_kazatel> there's also .netcom.no) Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[11:17:18] <duch_kazatel> [2014:04:10:11:16:28] <Spami> ah, how ?
[11:17:19] <duch_kazatel> [2014:04:10:11:16:30] <decx> what you do with the data is up t
[11:17:25] <duch_kazatel> JSON.parse
[11:17:28] <duch_kazatel> i give up.
[11:17:32] <duch_kazatel> new irc client time.
[11:18:12] <decx> i was looking forward to an accidental sensitive information pastemistake one point :(
[11:18:23] <decx> at*
[11:18:28] <Spami> duch_kazatel, I used JSON parse but the data isn't json
[11:19:49] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[11:21:34] <hxm> hi
[11:21:39] <hxm> where do I find this function parseFloat($.curCSS(
[11:21:55] <duch_kazatel> Spami you might want to use $.getScript in that case.
[11:22:02] <duch_kazatel> !g parsefloat javascript

[11:22:48] <CrowX-> I have a click event on a class. But I have an element of that class that loads a bit later, and the click event doesn't work on it. any elegant solutions to this, or should I re-implement the click event?
[11:23:11] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation, CrowX-
[11:26:25] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() { /* your code here */ });
[11:28:34] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, I have $(".text").on('click', loadText);   should I use $(body).on('click', '.text', loadText); ?
[11:28:39] <CrowX-> loadText in this case is a function.
[11:28:49] <duch_kazatel> don't bind to document or body if you can avoid it.
[11:28:55] <CrowX-> k
[11:28:58] <duch_kazatel> bind as far down the tree as you can.
[11:29:04] <duch_kazatel> something that doesn't swap out.
[11:29:04] <CrowX-> ok
[11:29:11] <CrowX-> what do you mean swap?
[11:29:19] <duch_kazatel> something that is static on the page.
[11:29:22] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't get removed.
[11:34:03] <hxm> curCSS has been deprecaed
[11:34:06] <hxm> what is the new command?
[11:34:58] <hxm> i found this parseInt($(el[0]).css('marginTop'), 10)
[11:35:31] <hxm> but I dont know how to adapt it to parseFloat($.curCSS(element[0], 'marginTop', true)
[11:35:39] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[11:35:45] <joroci> hey,  when i press tab the focusout event should trigger?
[11:35:46] <hxm> updating an old script
[11:36:29] <hxm> i have these functions http://pastebin.com/VsxxfudE of a fullcalendar script
[11:36:33] <hxm> to work with jquery 10
[11:38:28] <decx> why parseInt(num,10) when num | 0 does the same thing?
[11:39:16] <hxm> decx: I saw that example in a forum and I used to show it here
[11:39:22] <hxm> i even have no idea how parseint works
[11:39:39] <duch_kazatel> hxm i missed what you were saying earlier - what, specifically, are you trying to do?
[11:39:46] <decx> it'S more of a rethorical question, maybe there's some hidden benefit to parseint ,10
[11:41:27] <hxm> duch_kazatel: I am using fullcalendar and I get an addon for it which shows the full year as view
[11:41:42] <hxm> that addon is made in jquery 1.8 and my site is made with .10
[11:41:49] <hxm> then the curCSS function is gone
[11:43:06] <decx> damn, bitwise or is so much faster than parseint :o
[11:43:14] <duch_kazatel> it's also far less readable.
[11:43:18] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[11:43:38] <decx> i guess
[11:44:05] <duch_kazatel> hxm currCSS was just an alias for .css() iirc.
[11:44:06] <decx> that's the only benefit parseint has? for a simple elimination of decimals
[11:44:33] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[11:44:49] <duch_kazatel> oh readability?
[11:45:08] <decx> ye
[11:45:21] <BillCriswell> I like + over both.
[11:46:30] <duch_kazatel> parseInt()'s more for converting strings to numbers, ignoring the decimal.  9/10, the performance gain isn't worth the drop in readability imo.
[11:46:42] <duch_kazatel> *the performance gain in the bitshifting tricks.
[11:46:43] <hxm> i changed the curCSS for css but does nothing (no error but no success)
[11:46:55] <hxm> i go to go ahead in this experiment and aventure with parseint
[11:46:58] <duch_kazatel> hxm according to the jquery docs, that was the case.
[11:47:15] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/09/jquery-1-8-released/
[11:47:16] <snover> parseInt will be accurate up to 52-bits, using a bitwise operator will truncate to 32-bits. parseInt also reads non-numbers. parseInt also supports non-base-10 number values.
[11:47:30] <decx> the bitwise on position values to reduce antialiasing when something is aligned on a canvas subpixel had a measurable effect on performance compared to parseint in my canvas experiments
[11:47:36] <snover> in conclusion, don’t be a code ricer
[11:47:39] <snover> use the apis that exist
[11:47:51] <hxm> duch_kazatel: agreed
[11:48:32] <snover> Math.floor
[11:48:40] <snover> is the right one if you already have a number
[11:49:03] <decx> that always rounds up does it?
[11:49:12] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1789952/923919 -> the comment on this answer with 978 upvotes sums up my feelings.
[11:49:48] <decx> oh it doesnt
[11:49:55] <decx> which math thing always rounded up?
[11:50:01] <BillCriswell> ceil?
[11:50:05] <decx> right
[11:50:16] <duch_kazatel> also Math.round()
[11:50:27] <BillCriswell> That will round up or down.
[11:50:36] <duch_kazatel> ah that's right.
[11:50:55] <BillCriswell> Math.round(2.4) -> 2, Math.round(2.5) -> 3
[11:51:10] <duch_kazatel> kind of with b-ot had the REPL enabled.
[11:51:16] <duch_kazatel> >>> x;
[11:51:18] <duch_kazatel> >> x:
[11:52:40] <BillCriswell> I fucking hate bad html.
[11:52:49] <duch_kazatel> ++
[11:52:51] <duch_kazatel> all day erry day
[11:54:44] <decx> i saw someone use <b> for headings because the margins on h tags were too hard to grasp
[11:54:53] <duch_kazatel> that is beautiful.
[11:54:55] <decx> and extra big heading was <b><strong>heading</strong></b>
[11:55:25] <decx> even had a "b strong" css rule that speciied margins
[11:55:33] <decx> i had to "b strong" indeed to live through that
[11:55:52] <NoiseEee> hold on, b strong
[11:55:59] <duch_kazatel> uh what a moron obviously it's <FONT SIZE=24><b><strong>heading</strong></b></FONT>
[11:56:14] <decx> naw man you gotta put it in a table
[11:56:21] <duch_kazatel> fuck that's right i forgot.
[11:56:45] <duch_kazatel> oh and my tags should have been <FONT SIZE=24><b><strong>heading</FONT></b></strong>
[11:56:48] <duch_kazatel> keep them in the right order.
[11:56:56] <decx> haha
[11:57:16] <BillCriswell> Transparent pixels are the best margins.
[11:57:23] <BillCriswell> and paddings.
[11:57:26] <duch_kazatel> also: "above the fold"
[11:57:29] <duch_kazatel> and "pop"
[11:58:22] <duch_kazatel> jesus it's noon all ready
[11:58:25] <duch_kazatel> *already
[11:58:26] <BillCriswell> wow factor
[12:03:58] <duch_kazatel> reminds me of this client at my last place.
[12:05:04] <duch_kazatel> they wanted one of their clients to feel special and highlighted, so we had to add a link to their stuff in our navigation.
[12:05:26] <BillCriswell> Haha
[12:05:30] <BillCriswell> cause that makes sense.
[12:05:32] <duch_kazatel> then they wanted to link to "flash".  we asked them to clarify what they meant - they literally wanted it to change colors.
[12:05:54] <duch_kazatel> so we cooked up this:
[12:05:55] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/CR87g/3/
[12:06:14] <duch_kazatel> let it be known, this is largely the exact same code, with some very minor changes.
[12:06:52] <duch_kazatel> the account manager almost sent this out, but he asked us to change the speed of the flash because it "looked ridiculous"
[12:07:08] <BillCriswell> That's unfortunate.
[12:08:19] <duch_kazatel> when the client realized how fucking terrible it looked, they had us remove it.  We just commented it out in the source of the page, so you can still find it there as a reminder of how dumb they are.
[12:15:05] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: HAha nice.
[12:15:23] <BillCriswell> I wish I felt like spending $1,500 to go to event apart boston.
[12:15:35] <decx> should've used css3 animations instead :(
[12:15:44] <decx> vintage <blink>
[12:16:16] <duch_kazatel> decx hahahaha.  this was long enough ago that the browsers they were using didn't support them.
[12:16:18] <decx> btw, today i learned that i can set multiple % values in a keyframe rule
[12:16:19] <duch_kazatel> newspapers and all that.
[12:16:27] <decx> like 0% 100% { }
[12:17:28] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, it's amazing how flexible that makes things.
[12:17:47] <decx> by css conventions you'd think it'd be separated by a comma like multiple selectors for one rule
[12:17:56] <decx> 0%, 100%
[12:18:01] <decx> i guess that would make too much sense
[12:18:19] <BillCriswell> decx: Don't the rules go between?
[12:18:31] <BillCriswell> 0% { color: red; } 100% { color: blue; } ?
[12:18:56] <decx> yeah, now think about how normal selectors handle multiples
[12:19:15] <decx> 0% 100% { color: red; } 50% { color: blue; }
[12:19:29] <decx> instead of a more css'y
[12:19:33] <decx> 0%, 100% { color: red; } 50% { color: blue; }
[12:20:17] <BillCriswell> so 0% 100% works?
[12:20:21] <decx> yes
[12:20:41] <BillCriswell> Hm
[12:20:55] <BillCriswell> There's a demo I'm looking at here that uses the ,.
[12:21:02] <decx> huh i guess 0%,100% works too then
[12:21:55] <decx> no wonder we still have to use prefixes haha
[12:23:24] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/fexikete/1/edit?html,css,output lol weee
[12:23:50] <duch_kazatel> i thought that said "fontburgler" for a second.
[12:23:59] <BillCriswell> I'm in your computer.
[12:24:02] <BillCriswell> Stealing your fonts.
[12:24:06] <duch_kazatel> hehehehe
[12:24:28] <BillCriswell> I imagine I'd use commas very rarely in an animation?
[12:27:16] <decx> most likely in 0%,100%
[12:29:30] <axscode> hi guys how to do, i only want to addClass to li that has a child ul,like an menu item that has sub menu
[12:30:09] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, even then I think it can be avoided with animation-direction.
[12:30:17] <ankurk_> axscode: $('ul li').addClass('something');
[12:30:48] <decx> $('li').has('ul').addClass
[12:31:06] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: He wants the lis that have uls inside of them.
[12:31:30] <ankurk_> Damn
[12:31:54] <decx> that'll be 5 invisible #jquery points for me and not for you. HA
[12:32:26] <ankurk_> decx: someday I will start getting points too :P
[12:32:43] <axscode> decx: thanks, that was handy... works well..
[12:32:51] <decx> i'm keeping track and it'll be hard to catch up the 5billion that duch_lunch has
[12:33:09] <ankurk_> duch_lunch probably has more than that
[12:33:51] <decx> well i'm not here every day. so i can't keep track of it all
[12:34:50] <ankurk_> hehehe me neither :P
[12:39:15] <BillCriswell> I'm not even sure duch_lunch has a job.
[12:40:44] <duch_lunch> hahaha
[12:41:44] <duch_lunch> you guys are redic
[12:42:33] <BillCriswell> ...ulously handsome
[12:42:48] <duch_lunch> BillCriswell++
[12:43:47] <kristofers> Hey, i'm changing a buttons' class when clicked, so that i can have like a show/hide button on the same button
[12:44:09] <duch_lunch> wait what
[12:44:30] <duch_lunch> yo dawg, we heard you like buttons, so we put a button in your button so you can click while you click
[12:44:49] <kristofers> problem is it's not working after the class has changed , $('.hideButton').on('click', function() { });
[12:45:07] <kristofers> it's a button that has the class showButton when you click on it, it changes to hideButton
[12:45:10] <duch_lunch> event delegation, both classes.
[12:45:10] <ezrafree> kristofers: can you should some code perhaps so we can see what it is you're triyng to do?
[12:45:49] <duch_lunch> $('parent').on('click', '.hideButton, .showButton', function(){});
[12:47:07] <duch_lunch> OR add a third class and bind on that instead.
[12:48:18] <decx> you can attach some data to the element to keep track of state as well
[12:48:55] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/v4d8n/
[12:49:27] <decx> see, .hideButton doesn't exist on window load
[12:49:28] <duch_lunch> kristofers yeah you can only bind to things that exist at the time of binding.
[12:49:49] <decx> so you're attaching your click to an empty object
[12:50:11] <kristofers> ok but what could i do within the same click then ?
[12:50:23] <duch_lunch> bind using event delegation instead.
[12:52:50] <Omilun> hello i have 2 image ... first image is draggable and second image is droppable and i need drop fist image on second image ... and befor this hapend my i need first image fix on second image ... and when i change zoom option first image not have change position from second image : this is my project: www.omilun.ir/js-class/poiner/index.html
[12:57:33] <Omilun> hello i have 2 image ... first image is draggable and second image is droppable and i need drop fist image on second image ... and befor this hapend my i need first image fix on second image ... and when i change zoom option first image not have change position from second image : this is my project: www.omilun.ir/js-class/poiner/index.html how can i fix my first image on first pposition? plz helllllp
[12:57:45] <duch_lunch> woah dude
[12:58:08] <beancurd> hah.
[12:58:14] <duch_lunch> what exactly are you asking for help with?
[12:58:23] <beancurd> grammar i think.
[12:58:25] <duch_lunch> because that's a whole lot of "could you write this for me?" talk.
[13:06:04] <axscode> hi guys if i have   <ul>first degree<ul>second degree<ul>third degree</ul></ul></ul>   how can i do $('ul').addClass('only_for_the_top_most_parent');
[13:06:14] <duch_kazatel> axscode that's invalid.
[13:06:40] <decx> give your toplevel an id
[13:06:41] <axscode> considering there's li's inside it...
[13:06:52] <duch_kazatel> how about you share an actual example :)
[13:07:01] <duch_kazatel> in a jsfiddle, preferably.
[13:07:02] <decx> then you have your list object all packaged up and can do stuff with it
[13:07:23] <axscode> decx: my problem is that it is generated by a cms.. :(
[13:07:44] <fossxplorer> Why is the following failing? http://jsbin.com/yocecoca/1/edit
[13:08:36] <duch_kazatel> fossxplorer because you don't have jquery included?
[13:08:49] <fossxplorer> oh
[13:10:00] <duch_kazatel> axscode i mean, you could do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/dLJLC/
[13:10:16] <duch_kazatel> you could also do a filter()
[13:10:39] <fossxplorer> duch_kazatel, now i have it, still no progress
[13:11:05] <axscode> ah eq(0) works.. thanks duch..
[13:11:27] <decx> lol duch_kazatel
[13:11:34] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[13:11:45] <decx> "just hope it's the first ul on the page haha
[13:11:50] <duch_kazatel> yep
[13:12:03] <axscode> i have a wrapper... so first ul in the wrapper..
[13:12:41] <axscode> $('.the_wrapper ul').eq(0)... works..
[13:13:02] <duch_kazatel> fossxplorer i put some content in your arrowHome div and it's working.
[13:14:20] <fossxplorer> duch_kazatel, you are right. How do i bind that to click function? It should be an arrow which scrolls to top on click
[13:14:40] <duch_kazatel> .on() lets you bind events.
[13:14:46] <BillCriswell> I want to sleep
[13:14:47] <duch_kazatel> !mdn jquery on
[13:14:48] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
[13:14:49] <BillCriswell> for many moons.
[13:14:59] <duch_kazatel> woops
[13:15:00] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[13:15:02] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:15:24] <fossxplorer> Not $('#arrowHome').click(function(event){...?
[13:15:52] <duch_kazatel> fossxplorer .that uses .on('click' under the hood.
[13:16:13] <fossxplorer> i see. I will read a bit :)
[13:27:51] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: do it
[13:28:35] <duch_kazatel> a friend (who is an it director at another local company) asked me about the "heart bleed" virus.  after giving him some info on it, he then said "Thanks for the 411.  I'm a bit skeptical because Google "discovered" it."
[13:28:57] <duch_kazatel> i want to shoot myself.
[13:30:50] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Trying
[13:30:56] <BillCriswell> This project is putting me to sleep.
[13:31:48] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: Sleep man, you have been online for long now :P
[13:33:22] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: It's definitely been less than 8 hours  haha
[13:34:00] <ankurk_> It's about to be 8 hours though :P
[13:35:07] <BillCriswell> True
[13:36:52] <BillCriswell> I love that drupal gives me like 5 class names, not one of them are consistent across the same type of content.
[13:38:30] <decx> well it is php based so that makes sense
[13:40:35] <ankurk_> Sometimes I feel that I have only scratched the surface when it comes to JS
[13:40:52] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: I feel like that about most shit.
[13:41:21] <BillCriswell> decx: I need to learn it better for certain.
[13:41:34] <ankurk_> yeah, when it comes to concepts like Prototype, I go blank -_-
[13:43:59] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: I think I get that?
[13:44:16] <BillCriswell> I dunno. When words are attached to things I'm lost, but when I see it I know what's going on.
[13:44:37] <ankurk_> I am still not clear on most concepts in JS
[13:44:48] <ankurk_> even though I know common basics
[13:45:50] <BillCriswell> Got ya
[13:46:53] <duch_kazatel> prototypes is a little convoluted at first, but eventually it just sort of snaps into place.
[13:48:09] <logikos> if i use $.ajax and do not set dataType, and the server responds with text/javascript header and json (which if in firebug i can see its json) the .done() method does not fire, instead .fail() fires...
[13:48:15] <logikos> unless i set dataType='json'
[13:48:46] <logikos> but i have a case where i want it to adapt to whatever the server sends, if its json it will do one thing, if a string, something else
[13:48:58] <logikos> but if it sends json it uses .fail() instead of .done()
[13:49:10] <logikos> reading the docs i dont think this is the way it was intended to work?
[13:49:30] <logikos> it says it will try to intelligently identify the type of data ?
[13:49:37] <shoky> javascript ain't json
[13:50:17] <ankurk_> maybe duch_kazatel is right
[13:50:37] <logikos> so the header should be text/json ?
[13:50:40] <shoky> logikos: application/json is the right content-type for json
[13:50:43] <logikos> i know javascript isnt json
[13:50:46] <logikos> but json is javascript
[13:50:48] <duch_kazatel> the header needs to match the data
[13:50:51] <duch_kazatel> json isn't javascript.,
[13:50:53] <shoky> no its not
[13:50:59] <duch_kazatel> http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset
[13:51:00] <shoky> json is json, js is js
[13:51:03] <logikos> shoky: ty
[13:52:56] <BillCriswell> Aren't we just lucky that json works with javascript for the most part?
[13:53:06] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[13:53:26] <zagaza`> hi.. think anyone can help me out with my little issue? the masonry grid breaks when you press about and then back to latest post.. however it doesnt break when you press browse posts and then back to latest post.. it's because about is another page.. url/about.. anyone know how I could save the javascript from breaking despite that? http://danielnikolovski.com/
[13:54:14] <duch_kazatel> not breaking for me.
[13:54:37] <zagaza`> it must be
[13:54:47] <duch_kazatel> define "breaking"
[13:55:05] <shoky> breaks here
[13:55:20] <shoky> masonry stops working e.g. when you resize the browser
[13:55:49] <zagaza`> http://s30.postimg.org/cl8pathe8/broken.jpg
[13:56:56] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[13:57:34] <zagaza`> I've been messing with it all day can't get it right.. but then again I am new to javascript
[13:59:31] <BillCriswell> It's like... when something falls apart.
[14:00:18] <Omilun> how to know left and top on img tag ?
[14:00:34] <duch_kazatel> left and top what?
[14:00:39] <zagaza`> masonry does that
[14:00:54] <ezrafree> Omilun: do you mean the "left" and "top" css attributes?
[14:01:09] <Omilun> ezrafree: yessssss
[14:01:39] <ezrafree> Omilun: to read the value use: $('.selector').css('top');
[14:01:44] <Omilun> ezrafree: i have a project for jqury class
[14:02:07] <duch_kazatel> .css() can read and set css values
[14:02:33] <Omilun> ezrafree: and my project is this : http://www.omilun.ir/js-class/poiner/index.html
[14:02:37] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: thx

[14:05:42] <Omilun> ezrafree: i need when my pointer dropp on image not move (fixed) and when i resize my images , fix poiter not change position on image ... :(
[14:06:05] <duch_kazatel> Omilun you want the offset of it, not the css.
[14:07:07] <Omilun>  http://www.omilun.ir/js-class/poiner/index.html  ...this my project ... i can fix pointer but i can not fix on image position
[14:09:00] <duch_kazatel> Omilun stop linking over and over again.  that's going to make people NOT want to help :)
[14:09:43] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: :(
[14:10:17] <duch_kazatel> do you have any specific questions?  telling us what your assignment is or making generalizations isn't very helpful and doesn't really enable us to help you.
[14:10:44] <ezrafree> yeah i gotta do work of my own so i can't do it for you, but i'm happy to help out with any specific questions
[14:11:20] <duch_kazatel> that's the spirit of the channel :)
[14:14:31] <jimggg> Hi can I ask a jeditable question here?
[14:14:38] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ jimggg
[14:14:39] <b-ot> jimggg: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:15:03] <jimggg> http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s576/taurussable/jeditablequestion_zps117309c1.png
[14:15:29] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ jimggg
[14:15:29] <b-ot> jimggg: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:15:45] <jimggg> I am using the jeditable plugin, as you can see the input text field is not aligned with the other line making it hard for user to align their edit.
[14:16:02] <jimggg> will post code thanks guys
[14:23:55] <RiggsFolly> Anybody know blueimp Image Uploader well
[14:24:04] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ RiggsFolly
[14:24:04] <b-ot> RiggsFolly: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:24:07] <jimggg> http://jsfiddle.net/#run&togetherjs=fwFfClEc57 basically I want the input text to be aligned with the existing lines.
[14:24:23] <duch_kazatel> aaah togetherts
[14:24:32] <duch_kazatel> oh dude at least learn how to use jsfiddle rioght.
[14:24:52] <duch_kazatel> also - why are you using jquery 1.3.2 ?!
[14:25:04] <jimggg> it is from the demo of jeditable
[14:25:55] <RiggsFolly> I want to know how I can find out when image uploader has completed all its uploads. I am looking for some event I can listen to so I can start some other processing
[14:26:04] <duch_kazatel> jimggg http://jsfiddle.net/M9N7q/
[14:26:08] <duch_kazatel> this is how you fiddle
[14:26:27] <jimggg> Thank you.
[14:27:02] <duch_kazatel> RiggsFolly a cursory google search says you'd need to listen to the ajax .done()
[14:27:05] <jimggg> duch_kazatel, where is my script tags?
[14:27:53] <duch_kazatel> jimggg http://jsfiddle.net/M9N7q/3/
[14:27:59] <duch_kazatel> there we go, works now.
[14:28:03] <RiggsFolly> Not realiable I am afraid you get 1 per file  upload. I was looking for something that does a tidy up once all uploadds are ompleted
[14:29:28] <RiggsFolly> Google aint much help, the code is great, but we all know how we hate documenting our code, and its not that well documented
[14:29:41] <jimggg> thanks duck_kazatel. currently the two lines are aligned nicely, however when I try to edit one of them, the input text is not aligned with the other line. Can anyone give some suggestions?
[14:30:03] <duch_kazatel> RiggsFolly actually it's terribly well documented.  check out the stop callback maybe?
[14:30:59] <duch_kazatel> jimggg you're not going to find a very good solution to handle that unless you fundamentally change what you're doing.
[14:31:24] <jimggg> ic, I am open to other solutions. What should I look for?
[14:31:51] <duch_kazatel> this looks like tabular data to me.  would that be a fair assessment?
[14:32:04] <duch_kazatel> columns and rows of data?
[14:32:11] <jimggg> it is plaintext however it is aligned, it is free format..
[14:32:28] <jimggg> not exactly tabular, or else i'd use a editable grid plugin
[14:32:53] <jimggg> the user wants to edit the file, we give the user online edit access.
[14:33:19] <jimggg> but the user has to make sure the fields are aligned like the origninal file
[14:33:22] <duch_kazatel> the alignment isn't going to work well cross browser.  even in the same browser.
[14:33:47] <jimggg> got you. so pre can't solve that
[14:34:04] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:34:12] <duch_kazatel> you have columns and rows of data, so treat it that way.
[14:35:49] <duch_kazatel> is this data going to be consumed somewhere else?
[14:35:49] <jimggg> unfortunately that file is free format, each line may even have different columns. Thanks duch_kazatel, I may just let the user be extra careful in his/her edit.
[14:36:30] <jimggg> yes,  it is a config file, actually the alignment doesn't matter but when multiple users look at it they want it aligned.
[14:37:22] <duch_kazatel> that scares me.  you should have some kind of format that uses some kind of delimiter
[14:37:51] <jimggg> you are right, this is a legacy file which sucks
[14:37:59] <duch_kazatel> bummer.
[14:38:42] <jimggg> if you want I can show you how it looks, I can't paste it public however
[14:39:27] <duch_kazatel> if it shouldn't be public, then don't share it with me ;)
[14:39:51] <jimggg> ok I'll figure out some other ways, thank you!
[14:40:18] <duch_kazatel> you could always do what google does.
[14:40:27] <jimggg> how?
[14:40:50] <duch_kazatel> do you have gmail?
[14:40:50] <ilhami> Hey
[14:41:00] <jimggg> yes, i do
[14:41:20] <ilhami> How can I get a value from a <h2> by using jquery from a .php file?
[14:41:29] <ilhami> and where my jquery is in a .js file
[14:41:30] <ilhami> ??
[14:41:38] <duch_kazatel> jimggg compose a new message and inpsect the editable area.
[14:41:44] <decx> whitespace for a table that isn't a table? what's going on there
[14:41:49] <duch_kazatel> ilhami "value"?
[14:42:01] <ilhami> yeah the content :)
[14:42:04] <duch_kazatel> ilhami $('h2').text(); i guess.
[14:42:18] <ilhami> yeah but do I have to include the script in the file I am getting from?
[14:42:20] <duch_kazatel> not sure waht all that stuff about files is supposed to mean.
[14:42:32] <jimggg> yes, i got a ton of divs
[14:42:36] <decx> you can request a php file with ajax and handle the content it serves
[14:42:39] <ilhami> I need to show you by example I think... duch_kazatel...
[14:42:52] <duch_kazatel> the javascript must be included on that page, either via a src in a script tag, or on the page directly.
[14:43:11] <ilhami> last time I did it I got an undefined :D
[14:43:22] <duch_kazatel> did you do it in a doc ready?
[14:43:47] <ilhami> I did it in a function but dunnot if it was doc ready
[14:43:51] <ilhami> dunno*
[14:43:53] <ilhami> you can see here
[14:43:55] <ilhami> wait
[14:44:55] <duch_kazatel> hoo boy.
[14:46:16] <ilhami> duch_kazatel http://fpaste.org/93342/66363139/
[14:46:19] <ilhami> look
[14:46:31] <ilhami> the upper part is in the .js file and the lower part is in the index.php
[14:46:38] <ilhami> I havent included the script
[14:46:42] <duch_kazatel> ...
[14:46:45] <ilhami> but does it look correct?
[14:46:58] <duch_kazatel> $('#pay').click(function() {
[14:47:02] <duch_kazatel> what is this binding to?
[14:47:15] <ilhami> to a button :D
[14:47:19] <duch_kazatel> where?
[14:47:33] <duch_kazatel> this is incomplete.
[14:47:35] <ilhami> in a whole other file which I havent included in that example.
[14:47:50] <ilhami> but that part works :D
[14:47:55] <duch_kazatel> then what does the html you supplied have to do with anything?
[14:48:11] <ilhami> I want to get the text from that <h2>
[14:48:17] <ilhami> because it's product name
[14:48:26] <ilhami> and I have to include it in my order
[14:48:37] <duch_kazatel> $('front_page_title').text()
[14:48:41] <duch_kazatel> err
[14:48:43] <duch_kazatel> $('#front_page_title').text()
[14:48:49] <ilhami> so will it work that way?
[14:48:51] <duch_kazatel> also - don't do that.
[14:49:03] <ilhami> we are using Mongodb
[14:49:09] <ilhami> so we cant really join :D
[14:49:10] <duch_kazatel> generate IDs in your backend and use those instead.
[14:49:32] <ilhami> >we are using Mongodb
[14:49:36] <duch_kazatel> doesn't matter,
[14:49:48] <duch_kazatel> you need to generate a uniqueID for each product and base it on that.
[14:49:53] <duch_kazatel> not on a field the end user can edit.
[14:50:04] <ilhami> he can't edit it.
[14:50:13] <duch_kazatel> yes they can.
[14:50:15] <Omilun>  ex this is a child of my project on jsbin http://jsbin.com/yomeduso/5/edit?html,css,js,output how can i fix pointer icon on image when change image size
[14:50:16] <duch_kazatel> very easily in fact.
[14:50:22] <ilhami> this ID is stored in a session
[14:50:35] <ilhami> so how?
[14:50:47] <duch_kazatel> ilhami you just said you need to get the value of the h2 to add that product to the cart.
[14:50:58] <ilhami> yes h2 is a product name.
[14:51:14] <ilhami> not to the cart. We are adding the order to a database
[14:51:16] <ilhami> this is order info
[14:51:25] <ilhami> not product
[14:51:25] <duch_kazatel> that still sounds wrong to me, but whatever.
[14:51:40] <duch_kazatel> our application naps the product name from the database for order info.
[14:52:11] <ilhami> 2 sec
[14:52:53] <ilhami> also we made a ajax which calls every 2 seconds :D it's burning our servers hahaha
[14:52:58] <ilhami> it updates the stock
[14:53:01] <ilhami> all the time
[14:53:05] <ilhami> we are making a spotdeal site.
[14:53:11] <duch_kazatel> that's not going to be sustainable btw.
[14:53:27] <ilhami> what should we do then?
[14:53:45] <duch_kazatel> don't ajax content every 2 seconds?  refresh on pageload?
[14:53:59] <decx> start using console.log instead of alert and save 5 seconds on every reload when testing
[14:54:13] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:54:45] <ilhami> :D
[14:54:47] <ilhami> haha
[14:54:51] <ilhami> we like the alert
[14:55:08] <duch_kazatel> learn to use a debugger instead.
[14:55:23] <decx> that's frankly preposterous
[14:55:29] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[14:55:41] <duch_kazatel> using tools meant for debugging an application instead of alerts?!
[14:55:50] <ilhami> what tool do you recommend?
[14:55:56] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you using?
[14:56:30] <decx> you're mind is about to be blown and your ability to handle js problem will rise by a magnitude
[14:56:43] <ilhami> Firefox
[14:56:43] <ilhami> :D
[14:56:46] <ilhami> F12?
[14:56:48] <decx> firebug, console
[14:56:49] <duch_kazatel> firebug
[14:56:56] <ilhami> we use that as well :)
[14:57:02] <duch_kazatel> firefox's built-in tool is good, too.
[14:57:02] <ilhami> so console.log is better?
[14:57:04] <duch_kazatel> but use that.
[14:57:07] <duch_kazatel> get away from alerts()
[14:57:09] <nmz787_i> hi all, I'm trying to understand how to determine the displayed elements total height... I think somehow I'm double-counting though as the height is much larger than I expect it to be... using:        $.each($("*").children(), function(i,v) {
[14:57:09] <nmz787_i> 			    height += $(v).outerHeight(true);
[14:57:09] <nmz787_i> 			});
[14:57:18] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: ex this is a child of my project on jsbin http://jsbin.com/yomeduso/7/edit?html,css,js,output how can i fix pointer icon on image when change image size...PLZ HELP ME :(
[14:57:21] <duch_kazatel> don't paste in the channel
[14:57:30] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ nmz787_i

[14:57:32] <ilhami> :S:D:Sd.sdssd.as stop posting in channel
[14:57:35] <ilhami> pasting*
[14:57:45] <duch_kazatel> Omilun what did you try?
[14:57:50] <decx> ilhami have you ever seen an alert [object,Object] ? in console log you will be able to check what is inside that object, what functions are attached, everything
[14:58:09] <ilhami> decx: yeah I have seen it haahah
[14:58:10] <ilhami> :D
[14:58:16] <duch_kazatel> use it instead of alerts.
[14:58:19] <nmz787_i> LOL jsfiddle.net fails in IE
[14:58:26] <duch_kazatel> nmz787_i old IE, yes.
[14:58:30] <ilhami> thanks for the support guys. gotta go :)
[14:59:09] <duch_kazatel> fiddle supports back to IE9.
[14:59:15] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: whats ur mean?
[14:59:37] <duch_kazatel> Omilun what have you tried to fix your problem so far?
[14:59:56] <duch_kazatel> where do you think you'd start?
[15:01:57] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: i tried at 2days ango ... i think this chanel can help me :( i start at 3 days ago
[15:02:16] <duch_kazatel> Omilun where do you think you'd start to solve this problem?
[15:02:52] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: i dont know
[15:03:11] <duch_kazatel> okay.  start by looking at css positioning.
[15:03:33] <duch_kazatel> also, .offset() in jquery will be a big help, too.
[15:04:45] <nmz787_i> so I don't know how to make the function call get called on load or on run in jsfiddle, but here it is http://jsfiddle.net/qux4L/
[15:05:25] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: offset in jqurey can help me? ok
[15:05:38] <duch_kazatel> Omilun and css positioning.
[15:05:42] <duch_kazatel> nmz787_i http://jsfiddle.net/qux4L/1/
[15:05:48] <duch_kazatel> nmz787_i what was your issue?
[15:05:48] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: thx man
[15:06:07] <RiggsFolly> Thanks for nudging me in the right direction, not quite as simple as it looks, but at least you made me take a second or was it third look at .done
[15:06:39] <nmz787_i> duch_kazatel: what did you do to change it to get the alert?
[15:06:41] <duch_kazatel> RiggsFolly deferred objects are a little funky, but you'll learn :)
[15:06:49] <nmz787_i> duch_kazatel:  I can't see anything different
[15:06:55] <duch_kazatel> nmz787_i i added jquery in the top-left dropdown ;)
[15:07:03] <duch_kazatel> so what are you trying to do again?
[15:07:41] <nmz787_i> duch_kazatel: basically the height is about 2x too much
[15:08:05] <duch_kazatel> what do you want the height of?
[15:08:19] <duch_kazatel> wait what is this all for?
[15:08:21] <nmz787_i> the elements loaded/displayed
[15:09:02] <nmz787_i> duch_kazatel: I'm using a python web browser to make a GUI
[15:09:30] <nmz787_i> duch_kazatel: so on page load I need to get the size of the displayed elements so I can set the window size so it is fitting
[15:09:33] <duch_kazatel> nmz787_i why aren't you using CSS for this?
[15:09:39] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah okay
[15:09:51] <duch_kazatel> so you want the height of #main ?
[15:09:55] <nmz787_i> yep
[15:10:15] <nmz787_i> I knew the elements would never be wider than 300, so that's why i set that width hardcoded
[15:10:37] <RiggsFolly> duch: yea it fired on initialisation which made me look elsewhere to start with. Have to check some data exists to tell if its a dome initialising or DONE sending
[15:10:38] <nmz787_i> but the multi-select list at the bottom is populated based on dynamic data
[15:10:41] <nmz787_i> so it might change
[15:10:50] <nmz787_i> (from page load to another page load)
[15:11:34] <duch_kazatel> your floats are going to mess this all up btw.
[15:12:07] <nmz787_i> duch_kazatel: huh, actually the jsfiddle looks different than when i load it straight into chrome
[15:12:30] <nmz787_i> err
[15:12:31] <nmz787_i> wait
[15:12:33] <nmz787_i> maybe nor
[15:12:34] <nmz787_i> not
[15:12:59] <duch_kazatel> mind if I fix your markup and css a little?
[15:13:01] <nmz787_i> ugh, i wanted the text to the left of the drop-down boxes
[15:13:14] <nmz787_i> duch_kazatel: np, please, I'm not so good with css
[15:13:50] <nmz787_i> duch_kazatel: basically since its a desktop GUI, I want to turn off selection and right-click by default... but getting that done was pretty easy
[15:14:48] <duch_kazatel> there are a few things you could be doing to make this easier.  one sec.
[15:15:55] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/qux4L/2/
[15:15:57] <duch_kazatel> this is where you start.
[15:17:00] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/qux4L/3/
[15:20:57] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:23:07] <nmz787_i> duch_kazatel: http://imgur.com/By4IIC9
[15:24:24] <duch_kazatel> this was for a simplified examplke...
[15:24:45] <nmz787_i> duch_kazatel: i'm not worried about the little icon
[15:24:48] <nmz787_i> the tool
[15:24:50] <nmz787_i> the gear
[15:25:10] <duch_kazatel> what are you worried about then?
[15:25:20] <duch_kazatel> you want it taller?
[15:25:22] <nmz787_i> the "double click to open tool"
[15:25:35] <duch_kazatel> set a height on it then.
[15:25:50] <duch_kazatel> my only real change was changing some minor css and using form labels.
[15:26:41] <nmz787_i1> sry, connection dropped
[15:26:55] <duch_kazatel> my only real change was changing some minor css and using form labels.
[15:31:36] <nmz787_i1> duch_kazatel:  adding     div {clear:both;} seems to have made it look better
[15:32:04] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean, but ok.
[15:32:39] <nmz787_i1> it made the "double click to open tool" on a new line, rather than next to the dropdown
[15:33:03] <nmz787_i1> duch_kazatel: what are the label tags for? removing them seems to have no visual effect
[15:33:19] <duch_kazatel> they're semantically meaningful.
[15:33:40] <duch_kazatel> and allow you to later on target just that text if you need to.
[15:34:29] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't need clear: both; if you used my html and css changes btw, but whatever works for you.
[15:35:05] <nmz787_i1> the /3/ example doesn't look right, and simply adding a </br> didn't seem to add the separation
[15:35:30] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/ELxMIJb.png
[15:35:32] <duch_kazatel> that's what i see.
[15:35:58] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/P2lbRPD.png
[15:36:01] <duch_kazatel> that's in chrome
[15:36:29] <nmz787_i1> nah, the right side of this is what your /3/ example looks like for me, the left side is a mock-up of what i'm after http://imgur.com/By4IIC9
[15:36:51] <duch_kazatel> then i don't understand what's wrong, but ok.,
[15:37:05] <nmz787_i1> duch_kazatel: why are your two imgs looking different?
[15:37:12] <duch_kazatel> widths.
[15:37:24] <duch_kazatel> differences between chrom and firefox.
[15:37:34] <duch_kazatel> *chrome
[15:37:39] <nmz787_i1> ahh, yeah so I'm in chrome
[15:37:57] <duch_kazatel> but your target is some weird python-based browser, right?
[15:38:01] <duch_kazatel> soooo code to that instead.
[15:38:01] <nmz787_i1> using an python object to embed a chrome browser for a GUI
[15:38:11] <nmz787_i1> yeah its chrome
[15:38:18] <fission6> why is chrome complaining about an extra semi colon on line 9, http://dpaste.com/1776021/?
[15:38:20] <duch_kazatel> webkit or Blink!
[15:38:42] <nmz787_i1> i thought chrome was chromium... I thought they dropped webkit many years ago
[15:39:10] <duch_kazatel> chromium nope.
[15:39:24] <duch_kazatel> err, rather, it was the chromium project, but webkitw was the rendering engine.
[15:39:46] <duch_kazatel> Fishy because you're using that wrong.
[15:40:06] <duch_kazatel> i mean fission6  - $('#submit_btn').click(console.log("breasts")); is correct
[15:40:28] <fission6> wait why don't i need a semi colon after console?
[15:40:30] <duch_kazatel> though .click() will then append parens to that function name.
[15:40:38] <nmz787_i1> duch_kazatel: i guess the embedded chrome uses Blink
[15:40:40] <duch_kazatel> so you actually need to wrap that in an anonymous function.
[15:40:59] <duch_kazatel> fission6 because it's not the end of the statement.
[15:41:30] <fission6> ag i see
[15:41:40] <duch_kazatel> but you still have it wrong.
[15:42:35] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4hty4/1/ is what you're after.
[15:42:55] <duch_kazatel> or this: http://jsfiddle.net/4hty4/2/
[15:47:31] <nmz787_i1> duch_kazatel: so the height is still not right
[15:47:37] <duch_kazatel> nmz787_i1 yes it is.
[15:47:53] <nmz787_i1> on the jsfiddle you posted, its printing 80 ot the console
[15:47:59] <nmz787_i1> but the width is 300
[15:48:07] <nmz787_i1> and the height is obv about 1/2 the width
[15:48:15] <nmz787_i1> so ~150 should be printing
[15:48:22] <duch_kazatel> ... you're joking, right?>
[15:48:37] <nmz787_i1> no
[15:48:46] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/XMENbwJ.png
[15:49:08] <nmz787_i1> measure it on your screen with a piece of paper
[15:49:25] <nmz787_i1> the width is def 2x the height as-displayed on-screen
[15:49:27] <duch_kazatel> ...
[15:49:37] <duch_kazatel> i just showed you how it is rendered in chrome's console.
[15:49:49] <duch_kazatel> i think you are very confused about how pixels work.
[15:49:58] <nmz787_i1> duch_kazatel: even in the imgurs you posted
[15:50:05] <duch_kazatel> right.
[15:50:07] <nmz787_i1> the width is just about 2x the height
[15:50:11] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/XMENbwJ.png
[15:50:14] <duch_kazatel> look here.
[15:50:19] <duch_kazatel> i can't change how the browser renders things.
[15:50:20] <nmz787_i1> yes
[15:50:25] <nmz787_i1> i'm saying that isn't the right number
[15:51:19] <nmz787_i1> you're even in the
[15:51:20] <duch_kazatel> ah, because of the float.  that's right.
[15:51:25] <nmz787_i1> 'Computed' tab in the inspector
[15:51:28] <nmz787_i1> so its computing wrong
[15:51:41] <duch_kazatel> right - the browser is computing wrong.
[15:51:45] <nmz787_i1> :D
[15:51:54] <duch_kazatel> well, actually it's not - the float on your bottom select is the problem.
[15:51:56] <nmz787_i1> so the float messes it up?
[15:52:08] <duch_kazatel> one sec i'll show you.
[15:52:20] <nmz787_i1> I can't really understand why I can't just get the actual height as-rendered
[15:52:29] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/qux4L/7/
[15:52:31] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[15:52:31] <nmz787_i1> obv my monitor knows!
[15:53:01] <nmz787_i1> hey! 141 printed on console!
[15:53:14] <duch_kazatel> fyi - suggesting somebody holds a piece of paper up to the monitor is a quick way for them to discredit you ;)
[15:53:24] <nmz787_i1> welllll
[15:53:27] <duch_kazatel> but my apologies, i forgot about your float on that last select.
[15:53:33] <nmz787_i1> how else would i explain@
[15:53:42] <nmz787_i1> (i literally used a piece of paper)
[15:54:11] <duch_kazatel> by adding a border around #main and sharing that fiddle ;)
[15:54:50] <nmz787_i1> hmm, ok, will have to look into borders
[15:55:15] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/qux4L/8/
[15:55:26] <duch_kazatel> that should show you what's up.
[15:55:38] <nmz787_i1> as some people say about using a notebook vs a tablet computer for taking notes, paper can't crash!
[15:55:43] <nmz787_i1> anyway, thanks
[15:55:52] <duch_kazatel> kay
[15:56:07] <nmz787_i1> I will have to read up on float and why they'd mess with computed height
[15:56:17] <duch_kazatel> they remove the element from the normal flow.
[15:56:28] <duch_kazatel> clearing is how you correct it
[15:57:02] <systemfault> Or you can trigger a new BFC by adding overflow: hidden/auto
[15:57:09] <duch_kazatel> that too.
[15:57:18] <duch_kazatel> lots of ways to do it.
[15:58:00] <nmz787_i1> bfc html or bfc jquery doesn't result in seemingly meaningful google results
[15:58:24] <nmz787_i1> ah block formattting context
[15:59:31] <duch_kazatel> a-hyup
[16:03:08] <duch_kazatel> oh woah spotify made some big changes wtf.
[16:07:20] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, it went full Win8, why, spotify, why?
[16:07:32] <NicholasC> I don't even like it.
[16:08:03] <duch_kazatel> i actually really like it, but they made some minor functionality changes that are taiking me a while to get moved over.
[16:09:36] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, It feels very.. bootstrap-y
[16:09:42] <duch_kazatel> not to me.
[16:09:54] <NicholasC> I'm already looking at bootstrap all day, I don't want to see it when I want music :I
[16:09:59] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[16:10:39] <NicholasC> Ah well, I'll probably get used to it and stop noticing, like that other major overhaul a year back
[16:12:02] <duch_kazatel> they finally setup a half-decent way to manage saved albume
[16:12:10] <duch_kazatel> *albums
[16:14:00] <NicholasC> Howsat then? I just save them as playlists and be done with it
[16:14:22] <duch_kazatel> look under 'your music'
[16:14:25] <duch_kazatel> on the left.
[16:14:31] <duch_kazatel> 1-click saving for albums.
[16:14:56] <duch_kazatel> go to any album and you can click "save" on it.
[16:15:09] <duch_kazatel> also - starring went away in favor of "Saving"
[16:15:49] <NicholasC> Oh, that's pretty neat
[16:16:14] <NicholasC> I wonder how that'll look on 'droid
[16:16:31] <duch_kazatel> if you want to move all your "starred" songs to the new "saved" setup, just drag your old starred playlist onto "songs:
[16:16:58] <NicholasC> I never used the starred feature :(
[16:17:07] <duch_kazatel> I used it a lot.
[16:17:16] <NicholasC> but, I can toss out a lot of artist album playlists now
[16:17:17] <NicholasC> that's good
[16:20:20] <duch_kazatel> new android ui is nice.  i like it.
[16:20:52] <duch_kazatel> one-click "show me offline content"
[16:30:42] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, checking it now - had to free up space first. My phone's sadly cursed with the "bloated system file" problem
[16:30:55] <duch_kazatel> ouch.
[16:31:03] <duch_kazatel> i haven't run into that one.
[16:31:45] <NicholasC> Seems to be a common thing for dual-sim phones.
[16:32:17] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.
[16:33:56] <NicholasC> Still preferable over walking around with two smartphones, though
[16:34:29] <duch_kazatel> yeah, the space savings i'm sure are better - i know a dude who's doing the two phone thing, but mostly because he isn't currently able to pay for a smartphone plan.
[16:35:25] <NicholasC> It's mainly that it's easier to forget a phone when you've got two around
[16:35:33] <duch_kazatel> fiar enough
[16:35:36] <duch_kazatel> *fair
[16:35:45] <NicholasC> And let's not forget: grabbing the wrong ringing phonre
[16:35:49] <NicholasC> phone*
[16:43:02] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: ex not hellp ful for my project ... any way for my project?
[16:43:14] <duch_kazatel> "ex" ?
[16:43:41] <duch_kazatel> and those will be helpful for your project.
[16:44:31] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: ex = excuse me ... i can not use it ...
[16:44:39] <duch_kazatel> yes, you can ;)
[16:45:32] <duch_kazatel> you should probably also set those images as backgrounds to droppable divs, instead.
[16:46:25] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: dl img and make div?
[16:46:39] <duch_kazatel> nothing i said has to do with downloading.
[16:46:46] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn css background-image
[16:46:48] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: background-image - CSS | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image
[16:47:52] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: yes i know delet img tag and make div and set background color
[16:48:09] <duch_kazatel> sure
[16:48:11] <duch_kazatel> start there
[16:48:15] <duch_kazatel> make that div a droppable area.
[16:48:24] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: osu
[16:48:33] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:49:48] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: osu = ok i do it :D in tarateh we said osu
[16:50:20] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what that means, but ok.
[16:52:01] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: ok i make div and i set background color
[16:52:41] <duch_kazatel> *image
[16:52:43] <duch_kazatel> not color
[16:53:20] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: ok
[16:55:35] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: ok
[16:55:45] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: i set it
[16:56:07] <duch_kazatel> now your draggable arrow should be set relative to that container on drop.
[16:58:47] <duch_kazatel> that should get you started.
[17:01:38] <zalem-developer> i’m trying to set the value of an input control to the month and year of a session variable.  i can get the session variable but don’t know how to set the value of the input control
[17:01:52] <duch_kazatel> .val()
[17:01:53] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: for form fields
[17:02:19] <duch_kazatel> $('input').val('value here');
[17:02:35] <duch_kazatel> if you're using jquery, at least.
[17:03:12] <cluelesscoder> anyone have experience with flask? I can't get my xmlhttprequest using jquery to succeed. the server-side code is https://bitbucket.org/cluelesscoder/workprototype/src/4942f948b02deba8135be6e502ad249ff1e7f1e0/workprototype2.py?at=manytomany and the template with the jquery is https://bitbucket.org/cluelesscoder/workprototype/src/4942f948b02deba8135be6e502ad249ff1e7f1e0/templates/workprototype2.htm
[17:03:13] <cluelesscoder> l?at=manytomany
[17:03:56] <duch_kazatel> cluelesscoder are you getting any errors in the console?
[17:04:03] <cluelesscoder> no
[17:04:18] <cluelesscoder> it shows a get request but there's no response
[17:04:23] <zalem-developer> duch does that go in the document.ready function?
[17:04:33] <duch_kazatel> zalem-developer it'd need to be, yes.
[17:04:48] <cluelesscoder> not sure if there should be a response since I haven't written one in the server, but it's also not updating the database or triggering the success or fail callback function
[17:05:16] <duch_kazatel> cluelesscoder what happens if you hit the url directly, without using ajax
[17:05:25] <zalem-developer> it didn’t work…not sure what i’m doing wrong
[17:05:37] <duch_kazatel> zalem-developer fiddle your code please.
[17:05:59] <zalem-developer> i entered the line of code you suggested
[17:06:10] <cluelesscoder> AttributeError: 'sqlite3.Cursor' object has no attribute 'db'
[17:06:19] <cluelesscoder> nice... I didn't think to do that, still a newbie
[17:06:21] <duch_kazatel> zalem-developer i don't know what your html or other javascript looks like.
[17:06:29] <duch_kazatel> the code i supplied won't work out of the box...

[17:09:46] <duch_kazatel> $('#startDate').val('xyz'); will
[17:09:50] <zalem-developer> i need it to be the month and year from a date stored in a session variable
[17:10:19] <duch_kazatel> zalem-developer so set the value to whatever that was.
[17:11:30] <duch_kazatel> zalem-developer also, $(function() { and $(document).ready(function () { are basically the same
[17:11:31] <zalem-developer> almost there!…just have to know how to strip the time off!
[17:12:38] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[17:12:53] <duch_kazatel> Omilun okay?  what do you think you'd do next?
[17:14:55] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: yes i know it and in img tag worked it but i need when resize image or zoom page draggable image not change position
[17:15:21] <duch_kazatel> define "not change position".  you mean relative to the container?
[17:17:10] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: my teacher said its ur are home work ... i make a page but he said its wrong pointer ... chek this : http://www.omilun.ir/js-class/poiner/index.html
[17:17:26] <duch_kazatel> Omilun dude then DO YOUR HOMEWORK
[17:17:36] <duch_kazatel> you're not learning anything.
[17:17:53] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: :( yes ... u are right
[17:18:15] <zalem-developer> god i hate this stuff
[17:18:15] <duch_kazatel> you want those IMGs to instead be <div>s with their backgrounds set to the IMG you want.
[17:18:28] <duch_kazatel> then position the pointer dealio relative to that.
[17:18:51] <visua> Hey guys. I was hoping someone could suggest a fullscreen slider that has a vertical transition, rather than horizontal
[17:19:22] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: my pointer has relativ position
[17:19:34] <duch_kazatel> visua a "fullscreen slider"?  or a fullscreen carousel?
[17:19:51] <duch_kazatel> Omilun right.  so what do you think you'd do next?
[17:19:53] <visua> On my website (http://www.michaelnovia.net/dev/) Id like the 'launch' button to pull up a fullscreen slider. I know enough fullscreen sliders (like the one im already using) however I'm not equipped with the skills to re-write the transitions
[17:20:01] <visua> duch_kazatel yes, carousel is probably the correct terml.
[17:20:03] <visua> term*
[17:21:43] <duch_kazatel> something like this might work: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/carousel.php
[17:21:49] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to do your own styling and whatnot.
[17:22:09] <visua> Alright, i'll look into it.
[17:22:19] <visua> I guess making them 'full screen' shouldn't be too hard.
[17:22:23] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:22:26] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: i dont understand ur question ... i dont need help sory man ...
[17:22:31] <visua> Just need to mimic the background-cover functionality.
[17:22:55] <duch_kazatel> Omilun huh?
[17:23:29] <zalem-developer> sorry to bother guys….anyone know how to parse the month and year from a date value from a session variable.  i’m able to get the session value but don’t know how to parse it
[17:23:34] <visua> Well, i suppose I need to learn ajax too then ;)
[17:23:38] <visua> So i can load all the stuff in.
[17:23:46] <duch_kazatel> zalem-developer fiddle up the value.
[17:23:47] * visua goes and puts coffee o
[17:24:06] <zalem-developer> fiddle up the value?
[17:24:26] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/ -> paste the data in the javascript area.
[17:24:48] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: sory i can not understand bcz i nedd a fix pointer on a div . and i can not tell u . :(
[17:25:09] <duch_kazatel> Omilun still not getting what you mean, but whatevs.
[17:25:21] <zalem-developer> http://jsfiddle.net/zkgrp
[17:25:40] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:25:48] <duch_kazatel> what the "session variable" value?
[17:25:56] <duch_kazatel> you mean the data-value on that div?
[17:26:00] <visua> Would it be poor practice to do a fullscreen modal and stuff those galleries into their own pages?
[17:26:01] <zalem-developer> it’s a date/time
[17:26:16] <duch_kazatel> zalem-developer i need the actual value you're parsing.
[17:27:18] <zalem-developer> for example  07/01/2012 07:38:00
[17:27:27] <duch_kazatel> ...
[17:27:36] <duch_kazatel> is this being sent as a string from your backend?
[17:27:51] <zalem-developer> yes
[17:28:37] <duch_kazatel> okay.  there are a few ways to do it.
[17:28:52] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest lookling up date.parse() and the Date() object to do what you want.
[17:28:52] <snover> january 7th or july 1st?
[17:29:08] <zalem-developer> july
[17:29:21] <snover> no, i’m sorry, you’re wrong
[17:29:25] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:29:25] <snover> it’s january 7th
[17:29:35] <zalem-developer> i don’t care
[17:29:39] <zalem-developer> i just need to learn how to parse it
[17:29:41] <zalem-developer> that’s all
[17:29:54] <zalem-developer> in my controller, i set the session variable to the datetime
[17:30:06] <zalem-developer> and in my js, i need to parse the month and year from it
[17:30:18] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn date.parse()
[17:30:20] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Date.parse() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse
[17:30:25] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn date object

[17:32:15] <duch_kazatel> etc
[17:32:16] <zalem-developer> thanks duch….it has gotten me a little further
[17:36:55] <zalem-developer> duch, thank you for your patience
[17:38:20] <Omilun> duch_kazatel: i have a div for dropp and a div for dragg ... my project is when draggable div dropp on droppable div = not move and dragg again  when resive div or zoom page ... i can make updraggable div... but i can not fix it on position dropped...
[17:38:21] <duch_kazatel> of course!
[17:38:41] <zalem-developer> no, really, i appreciate it.  you don’t make me feel like a total idiot
[17:39:14] <duch_kazatel> we all had to learn some time.
[17:39:53] <cluelesscoder> duch_kazatel seems like you're the wizard on call right now, eh?
[17:40:02] <duch_kazatel> hah, something like that :)
[17:40:12] <duch_kazatel> wouldn't say i'm a wizard, just a glorified rubber duck.
[17:40:43] <cluelesscoder> duch_kazatel does that mean you're an expert at using floats or something? :p
[17:41:00] <duch_kazatel> i know my way around layout enough
[17:41:23] <cluelesscoder> I've got an issue with grabbing text from a textarea element...
[17:41:32] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it?
[17:41:42] <cluelesscoder> ok, let me see
[17:43:22] <cluelesscoder> is there a way to stop all the automatic indentation on jsfiddle?
[17:43:28] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:43:31] <duch_kazatel> embrace it :)
[17:43:47] <cluelesscoder> I like having control
[17:44:19] <duch_kazatel> do it in a text editor and paste it instead.
[17:47:15] <cluelesscoder> does jsfiddle have a console?
[17:47:45] <duch_kazatel> nope.  you just use the one in your browser.
[18:00:42] <zalem-developer> last question.  http://jsfiddle.net/almn5      when i change the date, i only wnat the onClose event to fire if the “Done” button is clicked…it will fire if you just click anywhere off the calendar.  is there a way to check to see that the “done” button was clicked?  using the sample from http://jsfiddle.net/yljdh
[18:06:30] <cluelesscoder> duch_kazatel: well having issues with the fiddle which is based on source code which uses a database. it is saying to use a post request. basically jquery is not picking up the most updated information in the text field
[18:06:36] <cluelesscoder> my fiddle is here http://jsfiddle.net/cluelesscoder/3NcGB/2/
[18:07:50] <cluelesscoder> well crap jsfiddle destroyed some of my javascript
[18:08:44] <cluelesscoder> what's the deal with jsfiddle not having a save button?
[18:10:53] <cluelesscoder> anyone know how I can get it to save my current version?
[18:11:34] <cluelesscoder> actually I figured it out... CTRL-S
[18:11:38] <gvo> cluelesscoder: update
[18:12:35] <cluelesscoder> gvo: could you give me a tip as to why my (.updatedesc).click is not firing the alert? http://jsfiddle.net/cluelesscoder/3NcGB/5/
[18:15:03] <zalem-developer> night all…thanks duch
[18:15:35] <cluelesscoder> yeah, time for me to get out of here too - thanks again duch
[18:16:03] <gvo> cluelesscoder: I don't see that it is displayed.
[18:16:12] <cluelesscoder> gvo: what do you mean?
[18:16:26] <gvo> On my screen i don't see the submit button.
[18:16:35] <cluelesscoder> click edit fields first
[18:19:14] <gvo> No I don't know why.

[19:11:46] <Jonno_FTW> hi, I have a <ul> with icons in the list elements, how can I have this converted into a dropwon looking thing
[19:19:52] <jphase> Jonno_FTW: you could accomplish most or all of that with css
[19:20:18] <Jonno_FTW> jphase: can you point me in the right direction?
[19:20:25] <Jonno_FTW> nvm
[19:21:43] <jphase> sheilablackrose: not sure I understand the description there, what are you trying to accomplish?
[19:26:47] <jphase> pzp: slideDown will only work on elements that aren't already displayed. add display: none; to your header element. also, you should use id="header" instead of id=header
[19:28:34] <pzp> jphase: the missing quotes was a typo
[19:28:49] <pzp> jphase: display: none to the HTML?
[19:28:58] <jphase> pzp: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/4eNLt/2/
[19:32:55] <pzp> jphase: thanks
[19:33:04] <jphase> np
[19:33:32] <pzp> How should I go about changing the background of <html>?
[19:37:05] <jphase> hmm?
[19:37:16] <jphase> changing, how?
[19:38:04] <Jonno_FTW> $('html').css('background:red');?
[19:38:38] <jphase> that'd be .css('background', 'red') rather
[19:39:37] <Jonno_FTW> or you could convert the mouse location to a color
[19:40:15] <pzp> hmm
[19:40:24] <pzp> how about setting it to an image
[19:40:27] <pzp> like a slideshow
[19:40:41] <pzp> would I just update an img tag?
[19:40:45] <pzp> *modify
[19:40:59] <Jonno_FTW> pzp: change the background to background-image
[19:41:11] <Jonno_FTW> and then have it on a loop or something to update
[19:43:33] <pzp> okay
[19:43:39] <pzp> too tired to try it tonight
[19:43:44] <pzp> thanks though
[19:44:19] <Jonno_FTW> pzp eg, setInterval(function(){$('html').css('background-image','url('+images.next()+')');},5000);
[19:53:58] <clueful> I just did the try.jquery.com and am pretty comfortable with that material, I'm wanting to make an autocomplete based on a call to a rest interface, I noticed jquery-ui, and also bootstrap...
[20:01:52] <jphase> clueful: super easy stuff indeed. jQuery UI makes that quite easy if you're not already using the bootstrap framework
[20:02:37] <clueful> jphase: not using anything yet, are they equivalent things jquery ui and bootstrap, as in I should choose one
[20:04:04] <jphase> clueful: they're not really the same, no. bootstrap is more of a css framework with a bunch of handy js things in a toolkit. jQuery UI is basically a set of jQuery drop-ins to perform common tasks in jQuery
[20:04:32] <jphase> if you're just wanting to add an autocomplete then I'd suggest using jQuery UI
[20:04:56] <clueful> jphase: would it make to use jquery ui for the autocompletes and then use bootstrap for css?
[20:05:43] <jphase> clueful: well if you're going to use bootstrap for the css portions of it, then you might as well use their autocomplete library as well and not worry about jQuery UI
[20:05:45] <clueful> jphase: I'm trying to get the functionality first, I've done most of the serverside stuff, and now I want to make autocompletes, but then of course I'll want to make everything pretty
[20:06:41] <clueful> jphase: do you have any suggestions for css type stuff?  I like the fact that jquery makes it relatively easy to do things without adding all kinds of abstractions...I haven't really looked into the css side of things
[20:07:23] <jphase> I personally use Foundation for a lot of my stuff
[20:07:37] <jphase> I prefer it over bootstrap, but I don't think they have an autocomplete in their js yet
[20:07:52] <jphase> it'd also be relatively easy to make a custom autocomplete if you wanted to
[20:09:07] <clueful> jphase: yeah I was also consider just doing it myself, but I did notice in the jquery-ui examples that there were a bunch of details about changing default behaviors to make things behave like you'd want
[20:09:18] <BillCriswell> jphase: How do you like foundation? Of all the css framework stuff I see out there that one seems like the only one I'd give a go.
[20:09:35] <clueful> jphase: that reminds me how does one do a debounce function in jquery
[20:09:45] <jphase> I <3 foundation personally
[20:10:48] <BillCriswell> clueful: The same way you would with regular javascript.
[20:11:16] <jphase> clueful: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/ looks like a handy example
[20:14:04] <clueful> jphase: I see you get a plugin for it and then it looks pretty simple to attach it I guess, great
[20:17:31] <clueful> It seems like bootstrap is designed to work with jquery, so at least they are compatible I guess
[20:18:04] <jphase> jquery is compatible with anything on the web since it's just javascript
[20:18:24] <jphase> well, outside of flash and things of other similar lameness ;)
[20:19:01] <nmz787_i> jphase: nice
[20:20:32] <Velveeta> is jquery compatible with telnet?
[20:20:58] <jphase> lol, I knew that generalization would get me in trouble
[20:21:02] <Velveeta> lol
[20:21:10] <Velveeta> can i jquery my aol?!
[20:21:23] <Velveeta> the commercial told me aol *is* the internet!
[20:21:45] <jphase> aol and myspace are the future
[20:22:02] <Velveeta> they're going to merge to form skynet
[20:22:37] <Velveeta> that's the reason the robots take out the humans.. not because of anything as glorious as survival, but rather a petty retribution for all the years we made fun of their users
[20:23:08] <Velveeta> i, for one, welcome our aolspace overlords...
[20:23:33] <Brewster> wait
[20:23:38] <Brewster> velveeta?
[20:23:49] <Velveeta> Brewster?
[20:23:52] <Uhkis> #jquery gone foilhat
[20:23:58] <Brewster> I think I know you from another network
[20:24:02] <Velveeta> oh yeah?
[20:24:09] <Brewster> anonops perhaps?
[20:24:50] <Velveeta> not sure.. if you're talking another irc network, i have no particular loyalty to any one of them, and i don't really track their names, only the channels i might visit... typically it's either freenet or undernet
[20:25:00] <Brewster> k
[20:25:00] <Velveeta> i think i've been on efnet a few times in the past
[20:26:00] <Velveeta> so, jphase and billcriswell, since you were just talking css frameworks...
[20:26:14] <jphase> :D
[20:26:15] <Velveeta> have either of you seen grunt-uncss? i just found out about it the other day
[20:26:21] <jphase> hmm, no
[20:26:29] <Velveeta> seems pretty splendiforous if it works as well as it sounds
[20:26:43] <Velveeta> written by addy osmani, too, and in addy i trust
[20:27:38] <jphase> looks dope
[20:27:41] <Velveeta> indeed
[20:27:50] <jphase> <3 me some grunt too
[20:27:54] <Velveeta> talking about reducing bootstrap's footprint by about 90% in a general sense
[20:27:59] <jphase> one thing most css frameworks out there are missing is the scaffold concept
[20:28:00] <Velveeta> that might actually even make it usable
[20:28:34] <Velveeta> one thing i don't like about most css frameworks, and it's a side effect of their need to gain widespread support, is just the absolute infinite extensibility of them, which adds a lot of bloat
[20:29:01] <Velveeta> in order to gain a large user base, they have to account for a huge number of design scenarios, so you end up with a package that's 100k+, easily
[20:29:09] <jphase> yeah, that's honestly what I liked about foundation was the fact that you can use sass with grunt or compass to modify and use whatever you need
[20:29:09] <Velveeta> and you may only use a small fraction of that on your own site
[20:29:18] <jphase> this does look rather spiffy though
[20:29:37] <jphase> I mean, the size alone
[20:29:59] <Velveeta> we're currently in the process of coming up with an updated style guide for our internal use at my company, and our austin and DC offices are both operating on separately ones for our respective products
[20:30:19] <Velveeta> so part of the goal is to unify the styles among the whole company, which is leading to some philosophical discussions about css architecture
[20:30:57] <jphase> yeah compilers sound like the only option for that
[20:31:18] <jphase> I'm loving SASS and LESS more and more now that I started using CodeKit on a regular basis
[20:32:06] <Velveeta> well, phase 1 is to just determine what methodology we want to use to architect the styles themselves, as in smacss, oocss, or whatever
[20:32:31] <Velveeta> then from there, figure out what semantic conventions we want to use for naming, and start adding support for a common naming convention into both of the current implementations
[20:33:00] <Velveeta> and then after a few months, when developers have had time to start migrating their markup over to the new semantic conventions, pull support for the old naming conventions, and start applying the new styles themselves
[20:33:45] <Velveeta> also, we use LESS currently, in austin, and they use SASS in DC.. neither of us are married to either of those particular technologies, so we're just evaluating the current feature sets, community support, etc, to see which one we want to use, or some 3rd option
[20:33:55] <MrTrick> Quick q: I've got some slightly complex visibility rules for certain DOM radio elements, eg "Whenever a radio button changes, show this div if ( radioA1 or radioA2 ) AND radioB1 are checked.
[20:34:35] <MrTrick> is there some way I can encode this into a selector and check to see whether it produces any matches?
[20:34:45] <jphase> yep
[20:34:59] <jphase> MrTrick: read this:  http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/extending-jquerys-selector-capabilities/
[20:35:13] <jphase> a rather neat way to extend the default selector ;)
[20:35:42] <shoky> you can't encode "whenever" into a selector
[20:36:00] <MrTrick> jphase: nifty, though what would that get me?
[20:36:06] <Velveeta> sure you can... $(':whenever') :D
[20:36:10] <shoky> ;D
[20:36:26] <jphase> granted, I usually use data attributes for what you're describing MrTrick - that link was simply to show that it's possible to make your own selectors heh
[20:36:39] <shoky> well i suppose you can if you really wanted to
[20:37:08] <MrTrick> shoky: at the moment I have something like; onchange="$('#mydiv').toggle( $('#radioA1,#radioA2').is(':checked') && $('#radioB1,#radioB2).is(':checked') )"
[20:37:45] <MrTrick> Problem is, it has to be defined on radioA1, radioA2, and every other radioA* element, and so-on for radioB*
[20:37:46] <shoky> uh
[20:37:48] <jphase> MrTrick: why not just use like data-group="2" for example and then bind to your all your radio change events to hide and show the right group?
[20:37:52] <shoky> why not put all 4 in the same selector?
[20:37:58] <jphase> ^
[20:38:06] <Velveeta> that would be about the best you could do with jquery alone, really, but maybe break that out into a standalone function rather than an inline change="" attribute
[20:38:10] <shoky> oh it's an OR, right
[20:38:33] <Velveeta> you could use some form of MVVM framework to help solidify some of that view logic, but that would be over and above jquery
[20:39:06] <MrTrick> data-group sounds familiar, but my initial googling isn't producing anything fruitful.
[20:39:36] <MrTrick> Velveeta: I looked at knockout, but it seems quite alien to me - the rest of the site is Backbone-based.
[20:39:47] <shoky> knockout would be great for this
[20:40:16] <MrTrick> possibly, but I don't really want to bind a bunch of values in there.
[20:40:17] <shoky> or yah any mvvm-like lib
[20:40:28] <shoky> sure you do
[20:40:53] <shoky> yer binding the visibility of #mydiv to the checked-state of other dom elements
[20:40:56] <MrTrick> as I said, I'm already using backbone heavily - I don't want to have *two* models to manage.
[20:41:02] <Velveeta> mrtrick: you could use backbone to set up something for this also, depending on how you have your view modules set up.. but otherwise, your best bet is just gonna be some jquery spaghetti code to hook this all up
[20:41:11] <shoky> or in mvvm speak you'd bind both to the viewmodel
[20:41:52] <Velveeta> it's gonna be tighty coupled to that specific layout, but sometimes that's just the tradeoff
[20:42:10] <Velveeta> i definitely agree though, if you're already using backbone heavily, i wouldn't throw in yet another framework on top of it just to get the benefits of mvvm
[20:42:26] <shoky> anyway $('#radioA1,#radioA2').is(':checked') && $('#radioB1,#radioB2).is(':checked')   is fine
[20:42:38] <shoky> the onchange is the bad part ;p
[20:42:43] <Velveeta> right ;)
[20:44:54] <MrTrick> hmm, how about <div id="enclosingdiv" onchange="$(this).find(".dynamicvisibility").change();"> ...
[20:45:18] <MrTrick> then the change handlers *on the elements that need to be dynamically shown* can handle whether they're visible.
[20:45:20] <Velveeta> well, like shoky said, the inline onchange attribute is really the bad part there
[20:45:56] <MrTrick> I'm trying (ha) to define this inside a mostly pure html template.
[20:46:00] <Velveeta> and as far as firing the change event of the elements in question, i would probably go with a custom event trigger
[20:46:06] <MrTrick> rather than having a bunch of logic somewhere else.
[20:46:28] <MrTrick> Given the visibility should be idempotent, I don't think it would matter if it's called more often than necessary.
[20:46:44] <Velveeta> well, i may be a bit of a purist on that, but i feel like html should be standalone as presentational markup, and behavior should all be specified in external js
[20:47:31] <__joshua__> Velveeta: purist?  more like a pragmatist.  screw maintaining inline code.
[20:48:25] <Velveeta> and as for the custom event, the change event is meant for when an element actually changes, not when an element needs to be told to change its state, so for your change event on the radios, i would probably do something like $(this).find('.dynamicvisibility').trigger('checkVisibility');
[20:48:31] <Velveeta> __joshua__: +1
[20:49:20] <Velveeta> and the elements that need to toggle their own visibility based on the state of that radio would just bind an event listener to checkVisibility
[20:49:29] <MrTrick> sure.
[20:49:31] <Velveeta> or else subscribe directly to the radio's change event
[20:49:41] <Velveeta> but they wouldn't implement their own show/hide logic in their own change event
[20:50:00] <MrTrick> inline vs separate though isn't quite so cut and dried, I feel - having it defined in a separate js file means having to switch back and forth to understand what's going on.
[20:50:28] <MrTrick> I could do something with data binding I suppose.
[20:50:41] <Velveeta> sure, to a point, but as a developer, the more tightly you couple your js to your markup, the more places you have to change it when requirements change
[20:51:13] <MrTrick> sure.
[20:51:27] <Velveeta> if someone at some point says "rather than change, let's make the even called changed", now you have to go through every place in your markup that you have an inline attribute, and change that event name
[20:51:32] <Velveeta> as opposed to one spot in your js
[20:52:54] <Velveeta> i would argue that context switching is a lot less expensive than the lack of code reusability and portability you wind up with when you do inline event attributes like that
[21:00:05] <MrTrick> oops, recursion. ^_^
[21:00:25] <MrTrick> Okay, I think I'll try for a very simple data binding approach.
[21:01:15] <Velveeta> on the topic of recursion, we were talking about that on a company skype chat earlier, since somebody mentioned the tail call support coming in ES6..
[21:01:59] <Velveeta> the funniest quote from that conversation was "not sure. i don't use recursion all that often just because i haven't needed it. turns out factorials in JS are pretty boring"
[21:02:27] <MrTrick> which brings me back to the selector question. if I want to show a div when a given combination or inputs are or aren't selected, how to?
[21:03:05] <__joshua__> perfect opportunity for declarative design, but you actually answer your question.....
[21:03:50] <__joshua__> oh, Velveeta: is es6 getting tail call elimination?
[21:04:22] <MrTrick> hmm, maybe I can get away with just parsing selectors for '&&'.
[21:04:55] <Velveeta> not sure about elimination.. the phrase he used was TCO, which i had to google because i was unfamiliar w/ it.. the article i dug up preferred the term "proper tail calls" to "tail call optimization", but makes no mention of elimination
[21:05:25] <__joshua__> same thing
[21:05:26] <shoky> same thing
[21:05:28] <shoky> ;p
[21:07:05] <Velveeta> same thing
[21:07:11] <Velveeta> sorry.. i was feeling left out
[21:08:11] <Velveeta> i still have to try to wrap my head around generator functions
[21:08:22] <Velveeta> along with the slew of other new stuff coming down the pipeline in ES6
[21:09:05] <__joshua__> var input_set = $('.input1, .input2...');.  input_set.on('change, function(){ var success= input_set.toArray().every(function(e){ return e.checked; }); ) or something.
[21:09:16] <__joshua__> yep, i must be bored
[21:09:24] <Velveeta> heheheh
[21:09:34] <__joshua__> i can't wait to use yield in real life
[21:11:25] <__joshua__> 50minutes until friday 5pm! yay
[21:11:32] <__joshua__> beer time so soon
[21:12:03] <Web4U> __joshua__, 50 minutes till friday 12:00 am
[21:12:28] <Velveeta> ^^ what that person said
[21:14:35] <beancurd> 50 minutes til... 3pm.
[21:14:37] <beancurd> ish.
[21:15:25] <Velveeta> i think we can all agree with this one: 45 minutes till the top of the hour! ........we don't have anybody in one of those weird half timezones, do we?
[21:15:57] <__joshua__> ew
[21:16:00] <beancurd> who cares about those weirdos.
[21:16:01] <shoky> namaste
[21:16:08] <shoky> j/k
[21:16:16] <beancurd> so...
[21:16:20] <Velveeta> we have office in india, so i'm quite familiar w/ that half timezoners :D
[21:16:28] <beancurd> i'm thinking of implementing jira.
[21:16:28] <Velveeta> offices*
[21:16:33] <beancurd> am i making a big mistake?
[21:16:39] <Velveeta> i love jira
[21:17:07] <beancurd> yeah? does it translate well to non-dev work?
[21:17:07] <__joshua__> i think its 5pm in the Chatham Islands
[21:17:32] <Velveeta> not sure, but i don't see why it wouldn't.. it's standard ticket tracking, despite the nature of the ticket
[21:17:43] <beancurd> say, can the designers / ux peeps get value out ouf it.
[21:17:59] <Velveeta> i've used redmine, jira, and fogbugz for tracking systems, and jira is by far my favorite
[21:18:02] <beancurd> oh, i want to use it for project management.
[21:18:27] <beancurd> less tickets, more planning/visibility/collaboration.
[21:18:34] <beancurd> i want something beefier than asana.
[21:18:39] <beancurd> which i adore.
[21:18:48] <Velveeta> well, we're currently migrating off of fogbugz and onto jira, organization wide, which will include our PM's and designers, so i would imagine there's value in it for those parties also
[21:18:57] <beancurd> neat.
[21:19:01] <Velveeta> but i haven't used asana, so i can't' make a comparison there
[21:19:40] <beancurd> asana is really easy to pick up, and ties in well with many diff kinds of workflows.
[21:23:25] <__joshua__> oh btw, im a fan of jira
[21:23:33] <__joshua__> cheap if you have <10 users
[21:23:45] <__joshua__> <=10
[21:23:50] <beancurd> yeah, I'll have about 4 users to begin with.
[21:24:05] <beancurd> i figure if i grow to 10+ users I'll be able to afford the 1k or whatever.
[21:24:19] <__joshua__> yeah release ~every 2 weeks too
[21:24:23] <__joshua__> they release*
[21:24:40] <Uhkis> isn't jira just super expensive trac?
[21:25:13] <beancurd> Uhkis: it's $10.
[21:25:21] <__joshua__> significantly nicer than trac
[21:25:28] <__joshua__> it gets expensive if you have 1000s of users
[21:25:51] <beancurd> 16k for 2000 users.
[21:25:55] <beancurd> that's... reasonable.
[21:26:13] <__joshua__> yeah, if you have 2k people using it, 16k is nothing
[21:26:16] <MrTrick> muahaha, working well now.
[21:26:18] <beancurd> if you're a 2k employee company..
[21:27:20] <Uhkis> that's monthly?
[21:27:32] <beancurd> no, self hosted.
[21:27:47] <beancurd> one time purchase
[21:27:48] <MrTrick> $form.find('input').change(function() {this.$el.find('[data-visible]').each(function() { $(this).toggle( $(this).attr('data-visible').split('&&').every(function(selector){return $(selector).is(':checked');}); }); });
[21:28:39] <MrTrick> oops, s/this.$el/$form/
[21:29:33] <__joshua__> methinks you can shorten it
[21:29:56] <__joshua__> why the toggle?
[21:30:00] <MrTrick> but basically "whenever an input in the form changes, check every element with data-visible defined (data-visible being an AND combination of selectors) If all selectors have at least one checked element, show the element."
[21:30:21] <MrTrick> __joshua__: because toggle( bool ) is 'show if true, hide if false'
[21:30:49] <MrTrick> It's more readable when it's not a one-liner. ^_^
[21:31:53] <__joshua__> ah
[21:31:56] <MrTrick> so eg one of my radio boxes is 'permanent employment' It only appears when; data-visible="#subtype_staff_support,#subtype_staff_academic&&#subtype_staff_fulltime,#subtype_staff_parttime"
[21:33:02] <Forbidd3n> I have an area (imagemap) that I am trying to take over the click event. Each map area has an attribute called menu
[21:33:15] <MrTrick> I might have to extend it to ensure that any hidden elements get cleared as well, but I'll see how it goes.
[21:33:39] <Forbidd3n> I am trying to intercept the click with $('area[menu]').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); console.log('Clicked'); });
[21:33:55] <Forbidd3n> but it still goes to the url and doesn't trigger the click function
[21:33:56] <Forbidd3n> ideas?
[21:38:07] <jphase> Forbidd3n: can you make a jsfiddle with your map in it?
[21:47:11] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can anyone help me with this
[21:47:12] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/faHBF/1/
[22:05:27] <sheilablackrose> anyone alive?
[22:08:17] <axscode> sheilablackrose: if you can rephrase your question/requirement please.
[22:08:19] <Uhkis> sheilablackrose: so what's the problem?
[22:08:34] <sheilablackrose> hey guys
[22:09:08] <sheilablackrose> if you take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/faHBF/1/  basically in each div will copy that list with its selected value
[22:09:21] <sheilablackrose> so instead of writing the list each time i would like to call it with a function
[22:09:42] <axscode> sheilablackrose: i can only see 1 div.
[22:09:43] <sheilablackrose> so when i click on one row it will copy the list set the selected value n show it on that row
[22:10:14] <sheilablackrose> acscode there one div with maindiv and the rest with myrow
[22:10:38] <axscode> where's myrow?
[22:10:49] <Uhkis> axscode: scroll down the html
[22:10:58] <axscode> err..checking
[22:11:03] <sheilablackrose> try this http://jsfiddle.net/faHBF/3/
[22:11:52] <sheilablackrose> well my real scenario is alot more complicated thats the simplest way i could think of to explain part of my problem
[22:12:38] <sheilablackrose> i have multiple rows that need that list so instead of creating it multiple times, i plan to creat eit once and when a user click on a row it will generate the list
[22:17:21] <Forbidd3n> If I have a function testThis(arg){ $('.el').click(function(){ console.log(arg); }); }
[22:17:35] <Forbidd3n> how would I pass arg from testThis to the click function?
[22:17:55] <noobgains> hey everyone, I'm a newbie deciding whether to use the 'accordion' in jQuery UI or implement this: http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/vertical-accordion-menu-using-jquery-css3

[22:18:34] <noobgains> any advice on whether it's better to use jQuery UI or not?
[22:18:49] <sheilablackrose> Uhkis let me see

[22:19:18] <Forbidd3n> anyone?
[22:19:49] <sheilablackrose> yeah exatcly
[22:22:11] <sheilablackrose> uhkis what if i have multiple selected values?
[23:06:30] <ven> hello guys, How do you  solve a problem with the Fix position in Chrome ios 7 (iphone). the fix position breaks when the virtual keyboard opens. i can't really post the actual code because it's in mobile and we can't have the virtual keyboard in this case.
