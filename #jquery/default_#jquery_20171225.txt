[00:18:10] <mehran> hi there
[00:18:21] <mehran> is this chat active?
[02:02:24] <inthl> I have an issue that drives me crazy for hours now. I am very close to give up, but I kinda need this. Assuming one has some average datatable, as given e.g. in http://jsfiddle.net/a708r8wj/ ...make the table small enough to get responvie into action. what turns up are (+) signs on the left, to show hidden content
[02:03:03] <inthl> my issue now is that I want to link the whole table row, so when one clicks anywhere on the row, it should follow a link. what I do NOT want is to follow that link if one just clicked the (+) sign to expand
[02:03:32] <inthl> (+) is a :before element, I can not make it happen to ignore a click on that pseudo element, since it is not part of the DOM. any ideas how to achieve this....?
[06:36:36] <Neo1> Hi!
[06:37:12] <Neo1> I'm adding class "fa fa-caret-right" to block and How can I remove old class only manually?
[06:38:06] <Neo1> addClass('fa-caret-right') and I'm getting two classes in block http://prntscr.com/hs0rc4
[06:38:29] <Neo1> Seems in jQuery was function that add class and remove all others?
[06:38:41] <Neo1> I've forgotten her
[07:39:45] <Garfield-fr> Neo1 removeClass().addClass('fa-caret-right')
[08:13:55] <Neo1> Garfield-fr: I've done this http://dpaste.com/3K9EZES
[08:15:00] <Neo1> Garfield-fr: I remember long ago I couldn't add class to block because when I did it all others classes automatically removed... Well, passed this
[08:20:05] <tocka> Hello!
[08:20:10] <tocka> Could someone help me out
[08:20:23] <tocka> and tell me why is the text changing only when the DIV fades in
[08:20:24] <tocka> ?
[08:20:25] <tocka> https://jsfiddle.net/s94Lqac3/6/
[08:20:38] <tocka> I want it to change when it fades out
[08:20:40] <tocka> Then it changes
[08:20:44] <tocka> then I fadein back again
[08:23:12] <Neo1> tocka: watch how it work, it's nature behavior and from here customize like you need )
[08:23:31] <tocka> Neo1 im a bit confused what you said..
[08:23:32] <tocka> :|
[08:23:52] <Neo1> said do like you need base on behavior this div
[08:24:50] <Neo1> just you asked why it works so, because this is the nature work of this block probably, it's can't work in other way )
[08:26:25] <Neo1> tocka: a few times run code careful watching how it works, then make conclusions, and change how you need. I just want to give fishing rod to you )))
[08:26:58] <tocka> Neo1: I actually dont understand why its fading in first
[08:27:02] <tocka> and then the text changes
[08:31:23] <Neo1> tocka: probably order? You call at first fading? Change order
[08:31:35] <tocka> ..
[08:31:38] <Neo1> tocka: will use deduction method
[08:31:52] <tocka> Im changing the text first ;/
[08:32:22] <Neo1> ok, well, probably this function work faster try call fade in timer
[08:32:49] <Neo1> setTimout(function(){here you call your fade fanction}, 2000);
[08:33:06] <Neo1> try explicitly make call later
[08:33:13] <Neo1> 2000 means 2 seconds
[08:35:03] <Neo1> tocka: I don't know but in javascript sometimes you call function later and they work always earlier then function that will called at first
[08:35:37] <Neo1> it's asynchronous working or I don't know how it called, not sequence
[08:48:41] <tocka> thanks:)
[11:42:14] <Rockwood> .change is depreciated ?
[11:44:52] <shoky> no

[21:37:03] <Everterstraat> Example?
[21:37:39] <Everterstraat> I hope with the libs there's nothing wrong, else everybody has the unexpected token!
[21:38:24] <Rockwood> https://kopy.io/MrFzx
[21:38:32] <Rockwood> Everterstraat, all code
[21:40:08] <Rockwood> having another error Slow network is detected. Fallback font will be used while loading: http://127.0.0.1:8000/quickadmin/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff2?v=4.3.0
[21:41:17] <Rockwood> how is it possible on my local server network is slow
[21:41:38] <Everterstraat> I can't connect to your localhost
[21:42:21] <Rockwood> .change is deprecated ?
[21:43:01] <Rockwood> or its need higher version of jquery  lib
[21:43:18] <Everterstraat> Isn't your localhost the problem with mime?
[21:43:29] <Everterstraat> libraries are good
[21:44:05] <Rockwood> mime means ?
[21:44:22] <Rockwood> i am not well aware by mime
[21:46:52] <Everterstraat> search for mime headers sent by apache/htacccess
[21:47:55] <Everterstraat> by default the present text/html insteed of text/javascript
[22:15:03] <Rockwood> core.js:5 Uncaught ReferenceError: define is not defined
[22:15:03] <Rockwood>  at core.js:5
[22:15:28] <Rockwood> Everterstraat, that is gone but now facing second one
[22:18:41] <Everterstraat> if (typeof define !== 'function') {
[22:18:41] <Everterstraat> console.log('Missing define function!');
[22:18:41] <Everterstraat> }
[22:19:15] <Everterstraat> Try that, if you'll see the "Missing define function" you're missing something before core.js
[22:19:30] <Everterstraat> I'm out of range, have a nice night
[22:21:15] <Rockwood> Everterstraat, cya take care
