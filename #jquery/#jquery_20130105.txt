[00:05:13] <eip56> How do i set the specific tag i want to grab using $.ajax... I know in load('PAGE tag')
[00:14:48] <systemfault> Create the Nodes with var content = $(contentOfTheAjaxResponse).find(tagHere); I guess
[00:35:22] <Validatorian> Is there any way to get the >clicked button< when binding to a form's submit? Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/mx7W2/
[00:44:31] <systemfault> I know it's possible with normal forms.. but I don't know with javascript
[00:46:32] <aviraldg> Validatorian, why don't you bind to the submit buttons themselves?
[00:47:14] <Validatorian> aviraldg: Using a validation script that binds to the form, would really prefer not to rewrite stuff if I don't have to.
[00:47:53] <williamherry> is it possible to bind function to dialog
[00:53:13] <aviraldg> Validatorian, something like http://jsfiddle.net/aviraldg/mx7W2/3/ should work, no?
[00:55:20] <Validatorian> aviraldg: It's not ideal, of course, but it works for me :) Thanks
[00:55:48] <aviraldg> np

[03:58:46] <HeN> jqueryQueue: whats your question?
[03:58:57] <jqueryQueue> hi i have a question why when i run such code $('some wrapper').fadeIn(function(){    console.log(  $(this).queue()  );    }).fadeOut()

[04:00:36] <Whiskey> Can someone tell me why tis be wrong http://tinkerbin.com/7K4Fvtl2
[04:00:38] <HeN> maybe you should read the jquery source code
[04:00:40] <jqueryQueue> but how jquery know about second function if it isnt run yet
[04:00:42] <Whiskey> Its shuld have the size after the box
[04:00:59] <Whiskey> Its the Math.floor(InfoViewWidth/cols) - (13*cols); that is wrong
[04:01:03] <jqueryQueue> i know i know
[04:01:32] <jqueryQueue> but maybe do u know
[04:01:46] <Whiskey> ??
[04:01:52] <jqueryQueue> HeN
[04:02:29] <HeN> jqueryQueue: I dont know, why do you need it?
[04:02:41] <jqueryQueue> im courious
[04:02:54] <jqueryQueue> becouse its strange for me
[04:03:10] <jqueryQueue> almost every jquery methods return jquery object
[04:03:29] <jqueryQueue> and i can chain methods, its normally
[04:04:09] <HeN> jqueryQueue: what are you trying to achieve?
[04:04:15] <jqueryQueue> but how jquery know about second function( and put it on the queue) i
[04:04:24] <jqueryQueue> hmm
[04:04:34] <jqueryQueue> im just intersting
[04:04:36] <jqueryQueue> courous
[04:04:38] <jqueryQueue> u know
[04:04:46] <jqueryQueue> i like to know
[04:04:48] <jqueryQueue> ;)
[04:05:02] <HeN> I see, you should go to the jQuery source code
[04:09:21] <jqueryQueue> is there any jquery guru
[04:12:30] <grafi> hm when trying that code i get an array with one item ...
[04:13:22] <jqueryQueue> ok wait
[04:26:15] <gry> hello, people! i figured jsfiddle can include external js and css files, and i can share graphs using jqplot and ask all the weird questions with you being able to test and fix things
[04:27:15] <gry> http://jsfiddle.net/9THwz/ is one example, a) what is preventing timestamp format from working? b) how can i perhaps define the y axis max value to be just large enough to include the topmost point?
[05:11:06] <Dirkos> What am i doing wrong in this one? Keep getting an error but the api gives correct result imo: http://jsfiddle.net/3jHmZ/
[05:12:03] <Dirkos> call returns http 200 though
[05:22:29] <Whiskey> dismist: :D

[05:34:13] <eizdealer> what am i missing here? why does sortable serialize only return an empty string? http://jsfiddle.net/2v2b5/
[05:35:02] <HeN> eizdealer: that should be $('#bb-stoplist').sortable('serialize')
[05:35:36] <eizdealer> aah gotcha
[05:35:37] <eizdealer> thx
[05:35:39] <HeN> .serialize() is for forms
[05:35:39] <b-ot> HeN, memorised “serialize()”.
[05:48:27] <Cameron_> how do i use the $('#divid') selector on some html
[05:48:31] <Cameron_> like rather than searching the page it just searches the "var html = "<div id="divid">sdfs</div>"
[05:48:35] <Cameron_> or how would i search the $(this) element
[05:49:26] <Iszak> Cameron_ $(htmlFragment).find('selector')
[05:49:32] <Cameron_> thanks
[05:59:02] <yousaf_> hi all any reason why this $('#brands').delay(1700).fadeTo(900, 0.3); is behaving differently in Chrome?
[05:59:42] <yousaf_> What I want is, when the page loads there should be a delay and then a particular image should fade to 30% opacity
[05:59:51] <Krambiorix> hi guys, this trigger doesn't get fired: http://pastebin.com/SnxVBjGD   can someone help? I try to add a parameter to the trigger
[06:00:34] <yousaf_> the code above does exactly that for all other browsers apart from Chrome. In chrome the on page load the image tends to be invisible, it then fades in and fades out to 30%
[06:00:40] <yousaf_> any ideas why?
[06:00:51] <Iszak> the image hasn't loaded yet?
[06:00:58] <Iszak> yousaf_ a working example would be nice.
[06:01:15] <yousaf_> sure one sec, although I can't replicate the same issue on jsfiddle
[06:01:35] <Iszak> ?trigger @ Krambiorix
[06:01:36] <bot-t> Krambiorix, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[06:02:21] <Krambiorix> Iszak, yes i tried .trigger('click',['test']); but that doesn't pass "test"
[06:04:18] <Iszak> Krambiorix oh you're trying to do this on an iframe aren't you?
[06:04:26] <Krambiorix> Iszak, yeps
[06:04:55] <Iszak> Krambiorix you first need to wait for when the iframe is loaded $(window).load() should work or perhaps $('iframe selector').load(fn) are you doing this?
[06:05:20] <Iszak> I also imagine if it's an iframe on another domain you probably can't trigger events for security reasons.
[06:06:12] <yousaf_> Iszak here it is http://jsfiddle.net/RTKYv/ but it works fine in that example
[06:06:38] <Iszak> yousaf_ well we need a situation where we can reproduce it, if we can't how are we meant to debug your code?
[06:09:21] <Kasimir> Is there an easy way to parse .xml (http://www.poikkeusinfo.fi/xml/v2/en) with jquery?
[06:10:00] <Krambiorix> Iszak, the iframe has been loaded before
[06:10:14] <Iszak> Krambiorix as in..?
[06:10:51] <Krambiorix> Iszak, the iframe is already loaded when i trigger
[06:11:01] <Krambiorix> the button is there
[06:13:19] <Iszak> Krambiorix what? visually from what you see? I don't know what you mean.
[06:13:38] <Iszak> Krambiorix I need a more complex example.
[06:14:07] <Krambiorix> Iszak if i do $("#myframe").contents().find('#shortcut_add').length  -> i get 1
[06:14:29] <Iszak> Krambiorix right, so if you run just trigger('click') does it execute the callbacks bound to that event? or not?
[06:14:34] <Iszak> Or is your problem it's not passing the extra data?
[06:16:39] <Krambiorix> Iszak, it executes the callbacks
[06:16:44] <Iszak> Krambiorix but the data is not there?
[06:16:53] <Krambiorix> Iszak, my problem is it's not passing the extra data
[06:17:02] <Iszak> Krambiorix how are you access the extra data?
[06:19:50] <Iszak> Krambiorix extra parameter (after the first) corrisponds to the data you pass (if it's an array). If you pass an object it'll be the 2nd parameter.
[06:26:46] <Whiskey> Can anyone help me whit this one, http://tinkerbin.com/OsdfGNYh
[06:33:03] <Krambiorix> Iszak, well that' s the problem : .on('click', function(ev,t)   alert(t) -> undefined
[06:34:42] <Iszak> Krambiorix hmm very odd, are you triggering it like .trigger('click', ['foo']) ?
[06:35:43] <Krambiorix> Iszak, exactly
[06:36:05] <Iszak> no idea, need a working example. Are you using the latest version of jquery for your minor branch?
[06:38:26] <Krambiorix> Iszak, 1.8
[06:40:55] <Cameron_> how would i find the code sandwiched between two variables?
[06:40:58] <Cameron_> with regex
[06:45:23] <Cameron_> str.match(/Rating:[\s](.*?)\/5/g);
[06:45:36] <Cameron_> how can i get only the (.*?) part rather than the whole thing??
[07:04:01] <SirFunk> hmm.. do errors not bubble up in javascript (to catch with try/catch) ?
[07:16:39] <duderion> Cameron_: try the .match in 2 steps
[07:17:00] <Cameron_> sorry i got it now, thanks
[07:17:17] <duderion> ok
[07:22:07] <NodeX> anyone do work with mobile sites?
[07:37:48] <jost> hi! Is there a simple way to check if an element has finished loading? I do not want to use the .load() event, as this could be registered to late, because the check should be used from a selenium test in a test grid, so delays are to be expected. So I want to use polling for this check.
[07:49:55] <kriestof> Hi, what does mean "$.infinitescroll = function infscr() ...} and what is the difference between "$.fn.smartscroll = function (fn) ..."?
[07:52:08] <Run\Stop> Quick question: I programatically create buttons in code: $('#container').append($('<button />').attr('id','some_button')); $('body').on('click', '#some_button', function() { /* some stuff here */ }) --- now when I do a mouse click on the button, nothing happens. Butwhen I trigger the button's click via $('#some_button').click(), the function does get triggered. Where should I begin looking?
[07:52:28] <sampaka> changing the select value programaticaly doesnt trigger the native change event of a select box. is there a another way to trigger this event
[07:53:06] <Run\Stop> sampaka: programatically trigger it after programatically selecting a value is the easiest way
[07:55:32] <sampaka> you think its easy - i was reading know for 2 days all i could find and no one has a satisfying solution
[07:56:20] <sampaka> .change() just trigers it only when the user changes the value
[07:57:36] <NodeX> on your change handler bind a custom handler
[07:57:53] <NodeX> when you programaitcaly fire tehn fire that too ;)
[07:58:15] <sampaka> a custom handler? any suggestion?
[07:58:23] <NodeX> ?custom
[07:58:28] <bot-t> NodeX, Custom - http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/custom-effects/
[07:58:48] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[07:59:02] <sampaka> ok! thanks a lot - i will do some more reading ;)
[07:59:05] <NodeX> ewww, what did they do to the jquery site :(
[07:59:07] <kamoricks> What happened to $.template()?
[07:59:12] <NodeX> my eyes are burning
[07:59:46] <grafi> woah thats ugly
[07:59:48] <grafi> oO
[08:00:03] <grafi> and bright
[08:00:09] <NodeX> very bright
[08:01:04] <sampaka> nodeX: i tried to trigger it like this $('#edit-field-paper-credit-layout-und').trigger('change'); after i changed the selected value programatically - but this did not work - what do you mean by a custom handler?
[08:01:30] <NodeX> bind a custom event to the select box and trugger that
[08:01:34] <NodeX> trigger
[08:01:47] <sampaka> may i ask how to do that?
[08:02:13] <NodeX> $('#foo').bind('bleh',function(......
[08:02:41] <NodeX> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-custom-events-they-will-rock-your-world/
[08:02:43] <NodeX> read that ;)
[08:02:53] <sampaka> ok! great
[08:03:23] <NodeX> :)
[08:04:10] <Run\Stop> Quick question: I programatically create buttons in code: $('#container').append($('<button />').attr('id','some_button')); $('body').on('click', '#some_button', function() { /* some stuff here */ }) --- now when I do a mouse click on the button, nothing happens. Butwhen I trigger the button's click via $('#some_button').click(), the function does get triggered. Where should I begin looking?
[08:04:57] <kamoricks> Run\Stop: $('<button>').attr('id', 'some_button').click(function () { /* some stuff here */ });
[08:04:58] <NodeX> you dont need an on() for a start
[08:05:05] <NodeX> ^^ that will do it
[08:05:34] <Run\Stop> i thought click(...) was a convenience method for .bind/.on
[08:05:39] <kamoricks> It is.
[08:06:18] <Run\Stop> i did try it the way you mentioned btw and get the same issue
[08:06:32] <NodeX> there is somehting else wrong in your code then
[08:06:39] <Run\Stop> im guessing its an issue with attaching before inserting into dom
[08:07:21] <Run\Stop> i just cant figure out why clickking on it doesnt trigger but click() does
[08:07:27] <kamoricks> Run\Stop: That would be a reason why $('#some_button') wouldn't find it, yes.
[08:08:06] <Run\Stop> kamoricks: $('#some_button') does find it since I can do $('#some_button').click() and that works
[08:09:15] <Run\Stop> going to see if .bind() or .live() makes any difference
[08:10:05] <Run\Stop> hmm i think i found the issue... maybe... one sec
[08:10:48] <Run\Stop> might be an issue with multiple buttons duplicating an id
[08:11:16] <saltcod_> I've got some nice fading, animating action happening on http://chayaczernowin.com/.  But its a complete nightmare in IE.  Should I cut my losses and not animate in IE, or does anyone think I can get things nicely animating in IE8&9?
[08:11:49] <saltcod_> Subjective question, I know, but I'm looking for a an experienced jQuery-ist to make a judgement about whether its impossible or not
[08:15:43] <Kasimir> Is there an easy way to parse .xml (http://www.poikkeusinfo.fi/xml/v2/en) with jquery?
[08:16:14] <ziyadb> saltcod_: beautiful. Though the onset delay is a little too long IMO.
[08:17:10] <saltcod_> thanks ziyadb: Yeah, likely so. I haven't tinkered too much with timing.   Think its worth translating into IE8?  Or should I just put a conditional in script, and have no animating for ie8?
[08:17:15] <jost> Kasimir, I'd try to simple create a jquery-object from it then use XPath... but I've never done that.
[08:17:38] <ziyadb> saltcod_: Hmm, at this rate, and considering its purpose, I'd say do away with animating for IE.
[08:17:54] <ziyadb> saltcod_: though it would certainly be magnificent if you did make it work..
[08:18:29] <sampaka> nodeX: i found this: The DOM only fires the onchange event as a result of user action not code. It does not provide any additional events to hook in this regard. On change my select form triggers ajax to load an image. do you think the custom event can do the trick?
[08:18:56] <Kasimir> You know of any example jost, been searching the net for the best solution, none have been good
[08:20:23] <saltcod_> ziyadb: I was going to try and make it work in IE, but then i had a look at this: http://jquery.malsup.com/fadetest.html in a virtual machine and it was very choppy. If he can't make it work, its hardly worth my time
[08:20:27] <jost> Kasimir: Perhaps this one: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[08:21:12] <ziyadb> saltcod_: fair enough.
[08:22:52] <kamoricks> Setting $('<option></option>').attr('selected', true) adds "<option selected="selected">" to the DOM but doesn't actually make it the selected item in its <option>. Why not?
[08:25:28] <Kasimir> Thanks alot jost
[08:26:45] <sampaka> can anybody help me with custom events. i try to trigger the change event when changing the selected option of select box programaticaly
[08:26:58] <eedfwchris> can i make an html audio tag "play" on demand with jquery?
[08:27:28] <eedfwchris> I tried adding .attr('autoplay')
[08:27:37] <HeN> kamoricks: try to use .prop() instead of .attr()
[08:28:49] <eedfwchris> oo bam got it jQuery("audio")[0].play();
[08:31:30] <kamoricks> HeN: No change.
[08:34:37] <HeN> kamoricks: http://jsfiddle.net/RezWa/ seems to be working
[08:35:09] <kamoricks> HeN: That it does. Something else is interfering, then, thanks.
[08:35:38] <HeN> yw
[08:45:18] <ziyadb> Good evening guys!
[08:45:24] <ziyadb> shoky: ping :P
[08:49:45] <ilian> Hi
[08:50:11] <ilian> can someone advice me a plugin or example how to load content on scroll down, like in pinterest
[08:50:15] <ilian> thanks in advance
[08:52:11] <mitzev_> ilan, its called 'lazy loading'
[08:52:15] <mitzev_> ilian,
[08:52:26] <mitzev_> g it
[08:52:58] <ilian> thanks mitzev_
[08:53:14] <mitzev_> :D
[08:53:35] <ilian> but I want to load data not only images
[08:54:12] <wroathe> ilian: What do you mean by data?
[08:54:17] <wroathe> ilian: Like text on the page?
[08:54:33] <ilian> html/javascript stull
[08:54:34] <ilian> yep
[08:55:50] <wroathe> ilian: So think about that in terms of the working parts... You'd need a container of sorts to contain your content then onscroll you'd have to perform an ajax request for just one paragraph at a time
[08:56:01] <wroathe> ilian: I wouldn't do that if I were you.
[08:57:19] <ilian> wroathe, facebook, pinterest and lots other are using it, I have separate blocks so it won't be loading half of the content but more like half of the search results
[08:59:39] <wroathe> ilian: So look at how facebook does it.
[09:00:41] <wroathe> ilian: Why are you in here asking us?
[09:01:30] <ilian> I just give facebook as example of what I wan't to achieve and asked for advice
[09:02:13] <kamoricks> ilian: Well, you want to listen for scroll events (or 'element-at-end' visibility), and when that's true, you want to load-more-elements().
[09:02:38] <ilian> thanks kamoricks
[09:02:56] <kamoricks> Yay basic reasoning.
[09:08:18] <TheEmpath> hi.  i have an element, with a click and mouseleave listener.  they work fine.  i add a mouseenter event to the element, and the click and mouseleave listener stop working and only the mouseenter event works.  also, when i click, it fires a mouseenter event as well.  any ever seen this before?
[09:26:29] <jammanbo> When I set the dataType of an Ajax to :json, the accepts headers are: application/json, text/javascript, */*. Is jQuery adding that */* or is it a browser thing? I can't find it in the source.
[09:27:28] <kamoricks> jammanbo: IE adds '*/*' to Accept.
[09:28:17] <jammanbo> kamoricks: I figured it was an IE workaround, but Im on Chrome. So is Chrome being helpful and adding it, or is it jQuery?
[09:28:30] <wroathe> jammanbo: It's jQuery
[09:28:57] <wroathe> jammanbo: Roughly line 7164
[09:28:59] <jammanbo> wroathe: Dont happen to know the line do you?
[09:29:01] <jammanbo> ah
[09:29:03] <jammanbo> thanks
[09:31:08] <jammanbo> wroathe: here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L519
[09:31:40] <wroathe> jammanbo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L40
[09:32:04] <TheEmpath> does mouseenter override click?
[09:32:09] <jammanbo> wroathe: cheers
[09:36:29] <wroathe> TheEmpath: Post code
[09:37:35] <TheEmpath> wroathe: https://gist.github.com/4251261efbf8b677b5ec
[09:37:53] <TheEmpath> i think the problem is that jsgraphic's redrawing is somehow tinkering with the listeners
[09:38:13] <TheEmpath> so when i mouseenter, the div listeners are adjusted, and so mouse enter is always firing
[09:39:56] <wroathe> TheEmpath: Why are the callbacks wrapped in extra parens?
[09:40:04] <wroathe> You don't need (function
[09:40:28] <TheEmpath> oh, sorry, thats when i was trying connectionElement.click and .mouseleave
[09:40:35] <TheEmpath> got the same effedct when i did those, too
[09:41:19] <wroathe> TheEmpath: Also, what is connection referencing?
[09:41:23] <wroathe> TheEmpath: Post more code.
[09:41:39] <TheEmpath> yeah... connection is an object that contains a jsGraphics object
[09:41:54] <TheEmpath> and the code is kinda massive.. its literally 2,000 lines of code that handle drawing
[09:42:07] <TheEmpath> its not my code.. im just hacking something to see if an idea is possible
[09:43:27] <TheEmpath> i can get away with now having mouseover functioanlity
[09:43:38] <TheEmpath> i was just struck sideways by having the events collide.. never seen it before
[09:44:49] <wroathe> TheEmpath: One sec
[09:45:18] <Whiskey> How do yuo get offsetWidth whit jQuery?
[09:46:10] <kamoricks> Whiskey: $(elem).prop('offsetWidth')... or elem.offetWidth

[09:47:09] <jrockjiggz> Hello
[09:47:12] <jrockjiggz> world
[09:47:18] <kamoricks> ggdevelop: HTML5 has the placeholder attribute. Modern phone browsers support this. Fallback would be $(elem).focus() and $(elem).blur() callbacks.
[09:49:12] <wroathe> TheEmpath: http://jsfiddle.net/Ga6HL/3/
[09:49:16] <Whiskey> k1ng it don´t like it
[09:49:18] <Whiskey> var InfoViewWidth = $('.infoViewBox').offetWidth();
[09:49:28] <Whiskey> kamoricks: :D
[09:49:34] <k1ng> what
[09:49:38] <TheEmpath> hrmmm
[09:49:46] <Whiskey> wonrg highlight k1ng
[09:50:21] <kamoricks> Whiskey: It doesn't magically become a method.
[09:50:29] <kamoricks> Function, sorry.
[09:50:47] <k1ng> highlight fail
[09:51:25] <kamoricks> Whiskey: $('.infoViewBox').closest().prop('offsetWidth'), if it's a DOM property.
[09:51:39] <wroathe> TheEmpath: So if the console.logs only fire once and then disappear than something is either deleting your events or replacing the DOM node they're bound to.
[09:51:48] <TheEmpath> ya
[09:51:52] <TheEmpath> thats my thoughts too
[09:53:22] <wroathe> deleting your event handlers I should say
[09:53:29] <Whiskey> this worked: var InfoViewWidth = $('.infoViewBox').prop('offsetWidth'); thx :)
[09:56:34] <Whiskey> what exactly does Math.floor?
[09:57:06] <wroathe> Whiskey: lol
[10:02:35] <Whiskey> I don´t get it
[10:03:03] <Whiskey> var container = document.getElementById ("infoViewBox"); give me an other sum then var InfoViewWidth = $('.infoViewBox').prop('offsetWidth');
[10:13:39] <Whiskey> i don´t get it js is so strange
[10:24:00] <shoky> one is id and the other is class..
[10:30:50] <ggdevelop>  i want to make login page to my mobile application, how am i doing a text area with the word password in it that will disappear when the user filled this
[10:33:08] <shoky> ggdevelop: kamoricks gave you an answer
[10:33:51] <mmanrique> ggdevelop: most mobile applications support the placeholder attribute for inputs
[10:34:13] <ggdevelop> really? ill chack
[10:34:22] <shoky> ggdevelop:  <kamoricks> ggdevelop: HTML5 has the placeholder attribute. Modern phone browsers support this. Fallback would be $(elem).focus() and $(elem).blur() callbacks.

[11:01:21] <Da_Wi> Hi, what is the state of the art method for using templates? I found "tmpl", but this seems to be deprecated. Any suggestions?
[11:03:54] <ryanneufeld> ?g jquery templates @Da_Wi
[11:03:54] <b-ot> Da_Wi
[11:04:02] <ryanneufeld> bah
[11:04:07] <ryanneufeld> Da_Wi: there are several
[11:04:17] <ryanneufeld> Da_Wi: Moustache, and handlebars for starters
[11:05:27] <Da_Wi> ryanneufeld, thx for the hints. I'll read the docs
[11:28:49] <Doxin> is there some sort of trick to using jquery with a templating engine? jquery events aren't playing nicely with mustache.
[11:29:28] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: What is your specific problem?
[11:29:42] <imsky> doxin just talk to me man
[11:29:47] <imsky> i am the solution
[11:30:17] <versatiletech> imsky: how modest :P
[11:30:25] <imsky> versatiletech: you can talk to me too man!
[11:30:31] <imsky> i'll solve anything
[11:30:49] <versatiletech> imsky: I need a million dollars
[11:30:58] <imsky> ok here's how you do it
[11:31:14] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: my specific problem is adding events, I can't do it onload, since the template isn't rendered yet. and I can't do it later because the template might be rendered multiple times. I can't give anything inside the template an id for that reason too,
[11:31:43] <imsky> make a web service that's a mashup of pinterest and groupon, set up referral agreements, and get at least 5000 transactions a month, versatiletech
[11:32:26] <Doxin> imsky: would you mind just leaving me alone already? you don't know the answer, and you're not helping.
[11:32:37] <imsky> lol not only do i know the answer
[11:32:49] <imsky> i'm ready to implement it for money
[11:32:51] <versatiletech> imsky: ok sounds good now how do I get to 5000 transactions a month? Not just "do seo, sem, social media"
[11:32:52] <imsky> nobody else is willing
[11:33:00] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: the problem basically boils down to needing to add the events /inside/ the template.
[11:33:11] <Doxin> imsky: I'm not paying you.
[11:33:14] <Doxin> now piss off.
[11:33:16] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: I don't understand
[11:33:19] <imsky> versatiletech: yeah that's a tough nut to crack, but you'll need to establish a presence on twitter. luckily you're just doing a mashup so a lot of marketing is already done
[11:33:52] <versatiletech> not as easy as you thought eh ;)
[11:34:07] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: it's tricky
[11:34:33] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: how do I add a click event handler normally? using blah.Click(function), right?
[11:34:42] <imsky> versatiletech: easy if you work at it, million dollars is a very low bar to clear
[11:34:54] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: or using on()
[11:35:09] <versatiletech> imsky: so you're a millionaire?
[11:35:27] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: right, where do I put that code so it's run as soon as the template is rendered though? even worse, the template might render out to multiple buttons meaning more than one event.
[11:35:28] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: so you're trying to bind a to a click event on elements that haven't been added yet?
[11:35:32] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: basically
[11:35:42] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: see ?on
[11:35:42] <bot-t> Doxin, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:36:10] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: Also, you if you're in control of when the elements are added to the dom
[11:36:22] <ryanneufeld> you can add your handlers after you've created them
[11:36:58] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: I am in control of that, but adding the handler after adding the nodes to the dom isn't going to work, let me paste the template so you can see, hold on.
[11:37:12] <imsky> versatiletech: yes
[11:37:21] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: I don't see how that won't work. I've done it. And it works fine
[11:37:31] <versatiletech> prove it
[11:37:32] <versatiletech> :D
[11:37:43] * imsky opens photoshop and BankStatement.png
[11:37:48] <imsky> one sec
[11:37:53] <versatiletech> LOL
[11:38:02] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/28886/ line 3 is the crux of the problem.
[11:38:21] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: yeah, I can see how that's a problem
[11:38:47] <ryanneufeld> Doxin, you have to pass in the ID when you generate that code
[11:38:51] <ryanneufeld> *html code
[11:38:55] <Doxin> correct
[11:39:00] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: So, you have the id
[11:39:03] <Doxin> true
[11:39:20] <ryanneufeld> so...
[11:39:37] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: can you paste the code you're using to add that html to the dom?
[11:39:46] <ryanneufeld> whatever code it is that calls your template engine
[11:39:54] <ryanneufeld> looks like moustache?
[11:40:05] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/28887/
[11:40:08] <Doxin> it is moustache
[11:41:03] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: okay, so instead of just passing the results of the template_postlist() directly into .html()
[11:41:05] <imsky> $.getJSON(apiurl+"/post/index.json?callback=?&limit=10&tags="+getQueryVariable("tags")
[11:41:08] <imsky> i love this channel
[11:41:35] <ryanneufeld> imsky: stop being an asshole
[11:41:43] <imsky> :(
[11:41:48] <imsky> but it's my specialty
[11:41:50] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: right,
[11:41:54] <chinoto> well... that's a fun opening message >.>
[11:42:29] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: gimme a sex
[11:42:32] <ryanneufeld> LOL
[11:42:33] <Doxin> ._.
[11:42:38] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: Gimme a SECOND
[11:42:41] <ryanneufeld> FML
[11:42:41] <Doxin> sure,
[11:42:43] <Doxin> will do :P
[11:42:47] <versatiletech> Doxin: O.o
[11:42:59] <Doxin> versatiletech: .-.
[11:43:08] <versatiletech> ryanneufeld: :O
[11:43:24] <ryanneufeld> who looks like the asshole now, amirite?
[11:43:30] <Doxin> lol
[11:43:32] <chinoto> blast, forgot my question
[11:43:53] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: also, you have a nasty habbit of not using semicolons
[11:43:59] <ryanneufeld> you should stop that
[11:44:03] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: yeah, I know.
[11:44:09] <versatiletech> it's a python thing
[11:44:10] <versatiletech> lol
[11:44:12] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: I program too many languages interleaved.
[11:44:29] <relipse>  when i do form.myradioboxname i get an array of radio elements, how do i know that it is not a <select> box?
[11:44:38] <imsky> relipse: you already got my paypal
[11:44:41] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: in javascript I forget semicolons, in python I keep doing if():, and in C I keep adding colons to loops.
[11:44:41] <imsky> let's do this thing
[11:45:59] <relipse> you should pay me to teach you
[11:46:01] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/28888/
[11:46:11] <imsky> relipse: what can you teach me
[11:46:14] <chinoto> relipse: you can check the tagName of the element and if it's an input, the value of type
[11:46:16] <ryanneufeld> imsky: stop asking people to pay you.
[11:46:24] <imsky> but isn't this a capitalist world
[11:46:29] <imsky> i thought this was america
[11:46:33] <ryanneufeld> I'm in Canada
[11:46:39] <ryanneufeld> so knock it off
[11:46:43] <imsky> oohh i'm sorry, i didn't know
[11:46:46] <versatiletech> relipse: $(radio).is(':not(select)')
[11:46:50] <imsky> how do you get paid, welfare checks?
[11:46:56] <chinoto> Canada is in America -_-
[11:46:56] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: that paste should help.
[11:47:07] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: right, that find("a").first looks shaky though, I'll go mucking with classes there. thanks a bundle!
[11:47:23] <chinoto> I understand the whole "America" thing, I just hate how things got screwed up
[11:47:35] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I you could also give the anchor an id='navlink_id' and then select with that
[11:47:36] <imsky> me 2 man
[11:47:37] <imsky> me 2
[11:48:53] <relipse> chinoto yeah i think that works if (!elm.tagName && elm.length > 0)
[11:49:03] <relipse> then its most likely a radio
[11:49:05] <ryanneufeld> chinoto: Canada is not in America. imsky you're really pushing the boundaries of funny vs offensive
[11:49:20] <imsky> ryanneufeld: you're really pushing the boundaries of autistic spectrum
[11:49:23] <relipse> hes only 14 give the kid a break
[11:49:29] <imsky> yeah i'm like 9
[11:49:53] <relipse> he just got through geography class
[11:50:02] <ruz1> guys any good lightgweight plugin for video player?
[11:50:02] <relipse> wait lets play with him a little more
[11:50:08] <relipse> dont kick him yet
[11:50:11] <relipse> wait like 30 seconds
[11:50:19] <ruz1> i would like just to control the play and stop and pause function
[11:50:25] <relipse> ask him to paypal you $30 to stay on the channel
[11:50:29] <ryanneufeld> ruz1: checkout popcorn.js
[11:50:34] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: its still going to #, and not the custom navigate stuff thougj
[11:50:41] <ruz1> oh ok
[11:50:41] <imsky> relipse: you just outed yourself as a high schooler
[11:50:43] <ruz1> thx
[11:51:03] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: hmm... perhaps do the binding after adding to the DOM
[11:51:09] <relipse> imsky: and how did I do that?
[11:51:13] <imsky> no wrong ryanneufeld
[11:51:14] <ruz1> @ryanneufeld does that supports all browsers?
[11:51:17] <imsky> you're already in #jquery and you're wrong
[11:51:29] <imsky> relipse: why do you think i'm 14 lol...
[11:51:32] * imsky is all ears
[11:51:45] <relipse> www.imsky.com
[11:52:08] <ruz1> @ryanneufeld it seems html5 so only webkit browser ?
[11:52:13] <chinoto> ryanneufeld: holy crap! you're partially right, America isn't a continent, but "North America" and "South America" are.
[11:52:26] <imsky> relipse: ok?
[11:52:37] <ryanneufeld> imsky: I'm wrong?
[11:52:48] <imsky> ryanneufeld: just tell him to delegate the events..jesus christ
[11:52:50] <relipse> hes got the gavel watch what you say imsky
[11:52:57] <relipse> hey dont take the Lord's name in vain
[11:53:01] <relipse> Jesus died for you
[11:53:07] <ryanneufeld> imsky: perhaps if you were being helpful instead of just trolling
[11:53:08] <chinoto> ...
[11:53:08] <imsky> relipse worst troll
[11:53:13] <relipse> i'm not trolling
[11:53:20] <imsky> ryanneufeld: i already told him to delegate in #javascript, he's just stubborn
[11:53:26] <imsky> ryanneufeld: you're gonna discover that in about...30 seconds
[11:53:33] <relipse> discover what?
[11:53:37] <imsky> nothing saxy
[11:54:08] <ryanneufeld> it can be done without delegation.
[11:54:09] <chinoto> relipse: so why not $('input[type=radio]')?
[11:54:27] <relipse> chinoto: you'll see
[11:54:33] <relipse> chinoto: gimme a few minutes
[11:54:34] <imsky> ryanneufeld: why would you do it without
[11:55:04] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: the click handler isn't getting added whatsoever
[11:55:27] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: is there somewhere I can see this?
[11:55:37] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: afraid not
[11:55:40] <ryanneufeld> http://progrium.com/localtunnel/
[11:56:15] <versatiletech> ryanneufeld: :O
[11:56:18] <imsky> :o
[11:56:20] <Doxin> ryanneufeld: right, doing that. keep in mind that I'm making a pornsite though :P
[11:56:31] <imsky> rudedogg: how r u my sweet dear friend
[11:56:41] <versatiletech> Doxin: no thx
[11:56:41] <imsky> HAHA PRON SITE
[11:56:48] <imsky> you're a low paid php monkey olol
[11:57:04] <Doxin> imsky: I'm not writing any php at all,
[11:57:10] <Doxin> imsky: (I'm not paid either)
[11:57:44] <imsky> Doxin: you're writing a porn site for free?
[11:57:52] <ryanneufeld> Doxin: haha, I see
[11:57:54] <Doxin> imsky: correct.
[11:57:57] <imsky> your life is on the upwards track
[11:58:15] <imsky> if only porn sites were in great demand
[11:58:17] <ryanneufeld> Wait, wut, you're doing a porn site for free?
[11:58:19] <relipse> lol that sucks i bet you don't broadcast that on your business card
[11:58:31] <relipse> are you the one taking your clothes off
[11:58:52] <chinoto> :D
[11:59:10] <ryanneufeld> SWEET TABS 'N SHIT
[11:59:22] <imsky> what
[11:59:26] <chinoto> derp?
[12:00:03] <tw2113> chirp?
[12:00:30] <ryanneufeld> hi tw2113
[12:00:33] <tw2113> yo
[12:01:02] <ryanneufeld> you're just in time. imsky is skating on the edge of being kicked
[12:01:21] * imsky is skating on the edge
[12:02:47] <bencahill> This is probably pretty odd, but...I'm using jquery to set the print style to be the screen style on an iframe. Then I get the height of the iframe contents, and apply it to the iframe. Unfortunately, the css change hasn't applied yet...if I step through the code, I can see that after the line where the css was changed, it still hasn't been applied. If I manually run the height code later, it works fine. Any
[12:02:49] <bencahill> ideas?
[12:03:20] <imsky> bencahill: set a timeout my dear friend
[12:03:21] <bencahill> If that wasn't clear, I'm changing media="print" to media="screen"...
[12:03:30] <imsky> something like 500 ms
[12:03:30] <bencahill> imsky: Yeah, that works, it just feels dirty. :(
[12:03:34] <imsky> it's not dirty
[12:03:38] <imsky> lol all of jquery is timeouts
[12:03:50] <imsky> you can also try nextTick
[12:03:56] <imsky> setTimeout(function(){},1)
[12:04:01] <imsky> though that may not work
[12:04:02] <Cameron_> if i have an unknown number of <p>s how can i get all of them in string form but ignoring the first 3?
[12:04:16] <imsky> $("p:gt(2)").text()
[12:04:19] <imsky> where's my money
[12:04:38] <Cameron_> ie. <p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p> would output "456"
[12:04:46] <Cameron_> er was that aimed at me imsky?
[12:05:02] <imsky> yes
[12:05:42] <Cameron_> that was quick
[12:05:58] <bencahill> imsky: Mmkay...before I was putting the setTimeout outside of the $('iframe').load(), so it was dependent on the iframe content loading...I put it inside the .load(), and set it to 50ms, and that's great. Thanks. :)
[12:06:05] <imsky> cool
[12:06:53] <ruz1> anyone good on popcorn.js ?
[12:06:54] <chinoto> I used setTimeout to see what the value of an input is after cut/paste (wanted to see if the input content changed without blurring)
[12:07:06] <ruz1> how to trigger play , pause and stop pls?
[12:07:18] <ruz1> i assumed pop.play();
[12:07:20] <ruz1> was ok
[12:09:35] <chinoto> any idea why this doesn't work?
[12:09:35] <chinoto> $(window).scroll(function() {var target=$(this).scrollLeft();$('#header').scrollLeft(target);});`
[12:09:35] <chinoto> [14:01:36.970] SyntaxError: An invalid or illegal string was specified @ chrome://browser/content/devtools/HUDService-content.js:530
[12:10:53] <ruz1> auauau popcorn.js experts here?
[12:11:21] <tripflex> if i use .ajax to load a json file is it possible to pass that data still in json form to another function?
[12:11:42] <chinoto> tripflex: you mean as the json string?
[12:11:49] <tripflex> yes
[12:12:23] <chinoto> I think you would tell jquery you want it as html
[12:12:34] <chinoto> I'm gonna go look
[12:12:47] <tripflex> ok thanks for your help
[12:14:39] <chinoto> tripflex: use 'text', html would probably be parsed and garbled
[12:14:52] <tripflex> then just pass it as a variable?
[12:15:12] <tripflex> or like right into the function
[12:15:18] <tripflex> mynextfunction(data)
[12:15:21] <chinoto> tripflex: if you want to use the json afterward, just use $.parseJSON()
[12:15:42] <chinoto> ...need to look more
[12:17:51] <chinoto> tripflex: I think you'll need to use the deferred function option, dunno what else you could do
[12:18:14] <Pwnna> is a good use case for deferred to observe if a variable is still null?
[12:18:21] <chinoto> take a look at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[12:18:40] <Pwnna> i.e. if i attach .done after the deferred object is resolved, will that handler fire?
[12:18:59] <relipse>  is it possible to do something like form.prototype.DoSomething = function(){ /*blah*/ }
[12:19:54] <Pwnna> anyone?
[12:20:05] <chinoto> relipse: why not just use $(...).on('event',callback)?
[12:21:20] <chinoto> Pwnna: I would think that any deferred function that qualifies would fire, like you could have multiple .success() chains for the same thing
[12:21:48] <Pwnna> chilversc: the thing is i need the callbacks to fire AFTER the deferred has been .resolved()
[12:22:04] <Pwnna> basically,  ineed to check if an object has come to existance, if not i wait
[12:22:13] <ruz1> does anyone knows about popcorn.js how to trigger events?
[12:22:55] <jrockjiggz> deferredObj.success( function(){ /* ... */ });
[12:23:44] <ruz1> @jrockjiggz for me?
[12:23:46] <chinoto> maybe this? http://api.jquery.com/deferred.always/
[12:24:54] <chinoto> oh wait... that's not it
[12:25:31] <imsky> chinoto let's be djs
[12:25:41] <chinoto> -_-
[12:25:49] <chinoto> *SLAP*
[12:26:20] <jbenet> Hey, quick question: could i get some help debugging a CORS issue? in short: POSTs work, PUTs dont. PUTs don't send 'Cookie' header, POSTs do. Any idea why PUT wouldn't?  (The OPTIONS response is the exact same for both, allowing the methods + allow credentials set to true)
[12:27:08] <Pwnna> http://jsfiddle.net/gQdNU/ ah it does work!
[12:27:09] <Pwnna> awesome
[12:27:35] <imsky> #1 stunna
[12:30:25] <chinoto> Pwnna: I was just looking, always() would help, you could use this.state() within it I believe
[12:30:59] <Pwnna> chinoto: it could fail.
[12:31:02] <Pwnna> so i can't use always
[12:31:18] <Pwnna> lol, i've been using recursive setTimeout before i knew this and have accumulated a lot!
[12:31:24] <Pwnna> i need to port those code over!
[12:31:53] <Pwnna> or not.. there's a lot of code xD
[12:31:58] <Pwnna> yeah.. no
[12:32:01] <chinoto> I was thinking you could say if (this.state()='resolved') {}
[12:32:27] <chinoto> unless you weren't going to do an else?
[12:32:43] <Pwnna> wait what?
[12:32:49] <Pwnna> i can either do resolve or reject
[12:33:06] <Pwnna> screw it. let's port the code over
[12:33:11] <chinoto> I think I should fiddle with this fiddle
[12:33:16] <imsky> i'll fiddle
[12:33:24] <imsky> for a generous fee
[12:33:50] <chinoto> some people need to die()...
[12:34:08] <ryanneufeld> he was warned
[12:34:55] <chinoto> Pwnna: http://jsfiddle.net/gQdNU/
[12:35:02] <chinoto> er...
[12:35:26] <chinoto> is this right? http://jsfiddle.net/ubdVm/
[12:35:39] <chinoto> haven't used jsfiddle
[12:35:50] <Pwnna> chinoto: why would i need to do this when t.done does the job without using this.state()
[12:36:07] <Pwnna> chinoto: those 2 code are equiv
[12:36:12] <Whiskey> Can someone help me whit a jquery code
[12:36:24] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @Whiskey
[12:36:24] <bot-t> Whiskey, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:36:43] <chinoto> Pwnna: if you're not doing anything on failure, your current way works better, initially I thought you were trying to handle failures
[12:36:50] <chinoto> as well as success*
[12:37:25] <imsky> ryanneufeld: <3
[12:37:26] <Pwnna> chinoto: i do handle failures
[12:37:31] <Pwnna> chinoto: i just attach a .fail
[12:37:33] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/NlvDQiTG this one :)
[12:37:37] <ryanneufeld> imsky: that was a warning shot
[12:37:39] <ti89breh> hi
[12:37:43] <ti89breh> tooltip thumnail is supposed to popup when you hover over a link: http://pupload.net/ind/ I am following this tutorial #3: http://cssglobe.com/easiest-tooltip-and-image-preview-using-jquery/
[12:37:49] <ryanneufeld> imsky: next time it's +b
[12:37:54] <imsky> ryanneufeld: i've been banned from this channel multiple times
[12:37:54] <Whiskey> I need to know how to expand the with on the lines to use whole boxsize
[12:37:57] <chinoto> I realize that, but... actually nvm, I'm just being silly
[12:38:02] <ti89breh> it does not work I am completly stumped can someone please look at it
[12:38:17] <Pwnna> lol alright.
[12:38:18] <Pwnna> no problem
[12:38:29] <Pwnna> porting a bunch of settimeout code over xD
[12:38:31] <Whiskey> the var InfoViewWidth = $('.infoViewBox').prop('offsetWidth'); will tell the size of the box and how mutch width it can use
[12:38:39] <imsky> ryanneufeld: probably shouldn't threaten people with your real name
[12:39:51] <ryanneufeld> imsky: is that a threat?
[12:39:59] <chinoto> imsky: the result of his threat is minor, why would you do anything about it?
[12:40:05] <imsky> i dunno man i might come to vancouver
[12:40:17] <imsky> check the place out

[12:41:13] <chinoto> actually that isn't an insult, nvm >.>
[12:41:17] <tw2113> you bunch of freaks

[12:41:30] <imsky> because he's tops
[12:42:17] <chinoto> your mum should have had an abortion -_-
[12:42:18] <ruz1> does anyone knows how to trigger play,stop and pause events with popcorn.js
[12:42:19] <ruz1> ?
[12:42:26] <ryanneufeld> chinoto: don't feed the trolls
[12:42:35] <chinoto> but... D:
[12:42:35] <imsky> chinoto: lol you're bad at this subtlety thing
[12:42:37] <tw2113> feed me instead

[12:44:14] <chinoto> $('chinoto').become_god()
[12:45:04] <Whiskey> im really stuck
[12:45:37] <chinoto> any idea why this doesn't work?
[12:45:37] <chinoto> $(window).scroll(function() {var target=$(this).scrollLeft();$('#header').scrollLeft(target);});`
[12:45:37] <chinoto> [14:01:36.970] SyntaxError: An invalid or illegal string was specified @ chrome://browser/content/devtools/HUDService-content.js:530
[12:52:16] <HeN> chinoto: the last "`" char?
[12:52:24] <Pwnna> how would i defer for 2 different events to be done and only when that happens, you're allowed to proceed?
[12:53:20] <Pwnna> chained done?
[12:53:27] <Pwnna> done(function(){done...})
[12:54:22] <chinoto> use an object variable both can access and use var[0] for one and var[1] for the other, then have a check on both to see if both values are true
[12:54:40] <chinoto> my first idea anyway
[12:55:24] <chinoto> or if javascript has bitwise functions, you could do some funky magic with that :D
[12:55:54] <chinoto> SWEET, it does :)
[12:57:58] <chinoto> var a=0;a=a|1;a=a|2; //a is now 3
[13:21:18] <ggdevelop> hey im beginner in jquery mobile should i download the builder ? http://jquerymobile.com/download/
[13:21:40] <ryanneufeld> ggdevelop: you don't download the builder
[13:21:47] <ryanneufeld> you use the builder to make a custom download
[13:22:03] <ryanneufeld> I would start with the full source though, until you know what components you need
[13:23:14] <jost> Is there a cross-browser version of $(img).load(someCallback) ?
[13:23:37] <jost> load does not work in IE <= 8...
[13:24:23] <chinoto> So I finally got my scrolly thing working, any idea as to why "jQuery" works, but "$" doesn't?
[13:24:24] <chinoto> $(window).scroll(function() {jQuery('#header').scrollLeft(jQuery(this).scrollLeft());});
[13:24:34] <Jon47> jost are you sure about that?
[13:24:53] <Jon47> images don't fire the load event if they are in the cache
[13:24:59] <ggdevelop> which full source?
[13:26:15] <chinoto> I thought load was an ajax shorthand for filling an element...
[13:26:30] <jost> Jon47, as far as I can tell, yes... the same code works in Firefox, Opera, Chrome and IE >= 9 in on XP, Win7 and Ubuntu... but in IE <= 8 the code triggered by $('img').one('load', function() {...}); is not executed, as far as I can tell...
[13:27:10] <ggdevelop> and other quastion : i have a option bottom and i want that when i chose an option it will link to a new page, how can i do that??
[13:27:23] <Jon47> jost interesting - usually stuff doesn't make it into jquery unless it works in IE6+
[13:27:28] <Jon47> i think that's the requirement actually
[13:27:47] <Jon47> are you absolutely certain the image isn't cached?
[13:27:53] <jost> I'm trying something else, maybe its another problem...
[13:28:14] <Jon47> are you also certain that your code is being executed BEFORE the load event occurs?
[13:28:17] <jbenet> hey, any thoughts on why a CORS PUT ajax request would not send Cookie? (POST does in the exact same setup)
[13:28:18] <jost> Jon47, no, actually the image is most surely cached. But in IE it works?
[13:28:28] <jost> In other browsers
[13:28:42] <Jon47> maybe you've turned cache off in them? I dunno
[13:29:07] <Jon47> also you can check the img.complete property to see if the image has already loaded, before you add your "load" event handler
[13:32:21] <jost> Jon47, ok, I'll try that... here are the relevant pieces of code: http://pastebin.com/Fe0GhYbR The image may or may not be cached, but it works everywhere except IE <=8...
[13:34:18] <tw2113> lols ie8
[13:36:16] <Jon47> oo new design for jquery api site
[13:36:19] <Jon47> looks pretty
[13:36:39] <tw2113> ui got one too
[13:36:43] <tw2113> ui.jquery.com
[13:37:02] <Jon47> sexy
[13:37:03] <tw2113> or whatever the right url is
[13:37:30] <tw2113> i've heard they're all getting these rolled out over time
[13:37:50] <chinoto> so I ran "var a;$(window).scroll(function() {a=$('#header');});" and checked "a" to find it was the raw element, no jquery wrapping, what happened?
[13:38:15] <chinoto> http://jqueryui.com/
[13:38:40] <tw2113> i wonder if they're using WP Multisite for this
[13:39:04] <SDr> anyone using flowplayer?
[13:40:07] <sampaka> i am strugeling the third day trying that my programaticaly changed select option triggers the change event so my ajax is executed - its now clear that changes not made by a user do not trigger the change event - so i was told to create a custom event - so i did it and it works with an alert() but now i dont know how to put my jquery so it triggers my ajax
[13:44:12] <chinoto> can't you just run .change() without arguments to get your original function to run?
[13:46:49] <hazamonzo> hey folks. If i were to attach a hover function to a div. Could i expect that hover function to execute on not only the div but also all of the contents of that div. Say for example a H1 title?
[13:46:58] <sampaka> no that seems not to be possible - i found on the web:"As you probably know setting the value of the select doesn't trigger the change() event, if you're looking for an event that is fired when an element's value has been changed through JS there isn't one."
[13:47:19] <sampaka> chinoto: las massage was for u
[13:48:10] <chinoto> sampaka: I get that, but after you are done messing with the select, just run $(...).change()
[13:48:31] <chinoto> that will trigger the event handler you added to the change event
[13:49:31] <sampaka> after reading 200 entries about that - the event handler is not trigged by programatically changed option
[13:49:32] <chinoto> perhaps I'll have to make a fiddle
[13:49:45] <chinoto> sigh...
[13:50:50] <sampaka> chinoto: FYI http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1219026/detect-programmatical-changes-on-a-html-select-box
[13:51:42] <chinoto> sampaka: I've done this before, and no it wasn't years ago, I was using it just yesterday
[13:52:27] <sampaka> i really hope you can help me - it seems  hopeless
[13:58:50] <chinoto> sampaka: I've never used selectedIndex before, got it now, will be done shortly
[13:59:12] <sampaka> ok!
[14:02:51] <chinoto> try it http://jsfiddle.net/fNPr4/
[14:03:06] <chinoto> I gotta go fold laundry now...
[14:03:08] <sampaka> great
[14:04:00] <hazamonzo> hey folks. I made a little jsfiddle to test something... http://jsfiddle.net/WmBGt/1/ this works as i would expect it to. If you hover anywhere over the div the background color changes... but for some reason.. in my app. when i hover over the div the background color changes fine but when i hover the h1... it does not... if that makes ANY sense at all
[14:05:47] <hazamonzo> Im trying to figure how i might go about debugging this issue... maybe some pointers? :)
[14:09:00] <jost> Jon47, Thanks - complete did the trick
[14:09:26] <Jon47> jost cheers
[14:18:09] <chinoto> sampaka: so, does what you want?
[14:18:35] <chinoto> (still gotta do laundry, was peeling veggies)
[14:21:28] <Cameron_> whats it called when  elements interact with the mouse, i want a very subtle effect where if the mouse brushes past leaves they will move
[14:23:51] <jost> Cameron: mouseenter() and mouseleave() could be what you want
[14:24:08] <cebor> hi, $.post('/blog/add/ajax', $('#addBlogForm').serialize());  works fine when i place this in the console,   but dont work inside a click function, does anybody know why ??
[14:24:10] <Cameron_> hmm perhaps
[14:24:27] <Cameron_> jost, but i was hoping for it to be a bit more advanced
[14:24:28] <jost> or mouseover
[14:24:31] <jost> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/mouse-events/
[14:24:35] <djQuery> getting an error on a very basic jquery mobile page.
[14:24:37] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/awojuj/4/edit
[14:24:38] <Cameron_> if the mouse comes from one direction the leaf will ping in the other
[14:24:47] <Cameron_> like it looks realistic
[14:25:20] <djQuery> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'subPageUrlKey' of undefined
[14:25:57] <Cameron_> i think i can do it
[14:26:56] <djQuery> fixed it
[14:44:49] <md_5> is there something like jquery.find that returns a jquery object
[14:50:02] <astropirate> md_5, yes
[14:50:04] <astropirate> jquery.find
[14:50:09] <astropirate>    :|
[14:50:33] <md_5> I swear I am having to do $(self.find(".col-project a")).first() though aslant
[14:50:36] <md_5> astropirate
[14:50:56] <aslant> md_5: tsk ')
[14:56:01] <amh345> im having a problem getting my .submit function working on an ajax form using an image submit button. http://jsfiddle.net/AqR28/   i've tried a few methods to get it to work but so far no luck.  can anyone offer assistance?
[15:03:40] <SDr> I'm using  http://pastebin.com/X5mxtN2n   to trigger a replay of a video (from 0). this works excellent in firefox, but does nothing in chrome. any idea why that might be
[15:03:41] <SDr> ?
[15:04:52] <SDr> oooh,chrome uses html5, while ff uses the flash player
[15:08:58] <cambazz> hello, why the following statement crashes: var a = $('#datat_'+ id + ' tr').length();
[15:09:02] <cambazz> id is a string
[15:09:24] <cambazz> datat_somename is a table
[15:11:01] <monk3y> cambazz: when you say it "crashes"; what do you mean?  What does the console say?  Maybe you'd want to dump the selected object to the console, before trying to get its length?
[15:12:32] <cambazz> monk3y: well, it is running inside a bind('submit') ..
[15:12:42] <cambazz> that returns false, thus stopping the form not to submit
[15:12:49] <cambazz> but with this line, the form will submit
[15:12:55] <cambazz> and it wont also print a
[15:13:28] <chinoto> cambazz: try replacing all instances of '$' with 'jQuery', I just had a problem that was somehow fixed by that
[15:13:47] <chinoto> I would like to find out why I couldn't use '$' >.<
[15:14:41] <cambazz> chinoto: how do we do that? $jQuery.
[15:15:19] <chinoto> "$('div')" would be "jQuery('div')"
[15:15:32] <cambazz> ok i did that and no use
[15:15:35] <chinoto> $ is convenient shorthand for jQuery
[15:15:37] <chinoto> blast
[15:15:56] <chinoto> well, that's all I got
[15:16:38] <Gorroth> hi
[15:16:45] <chinoto> boo
[15:17:16] <Gorroth> is there any way i can select all the elements of a HTML page that belong to a form or div with a particular id?  i have a couple hidden forms that only show up when i use the jquery UI dialog widget
[15:17:19] <Tomashe> hey guys i got some issue, $(".IB_CC a").animate({"right":"-=958px"},1000,'',function(){ alert('1'); }); inside setInterval , it always alert('1') twise on each loop, any ideas?
[15:17:39] <Gorroth> and when i click the "submit" button to call my JS handler, i only want to put the relevant fields in the POST
[15:18:02] <Gorroth> s/all the elements/all the input tags/
[15:18:08] <Tomashe> Gorroth try $(document).ready(function(){ }); < try to load your select inside of that
[15:18:25] <jost> Gorroth: $('#IdOfTheForm').find('input')
[15:18:35] <chinoto> Gorroth: so what you mean is you want to grab all the inputs of the form and put them into the post?
[15:18:36] <Gorroth> jost: ah, thanks!
[15:18:48] <Gorroth> chinoto: yeah, exactly
[15:18:56] <chinoto> I got a wonderful little function for that :D
[15:19:05] <jost> Gorroth: $('#IdOfTheForm input') is even shorter
[15:19:09] <Gorroth> i put things in the POST fine, i just didn't select the right elements
[15:19:23] <Gorroth> jost: beautiful!  i knew some sort of selector would do it
[15:19:47] <Tomashe> can get help guys?
[15:19:49] <amh345> does anyone have any ideas on my ajax image form submit issue? http://jsfiddle.net/AqR28/
[15:20:08] <chinoto> Gorroth: you'll have to do a little fiddling to get into a post
[15:20:18] <Gorroth> i already get it into POSTs
[15:21:01] <Gorroth> jost: that worked perfectly; thanks again!
[15:21:44] <chinoto> huh
[16:30:52] <unblockgames> i have a question about the $.get. I can have the callback function creating a string but i need that string to end up in the function that called the $.get. how do i accomplish this?
[16:33:10] <unblockgames> is there a way to get the json from the $.get response or is the callback data parameter the only way
[16:33:40] <idlesysop> you can use a deferred, since it's an ajax call it's asynchronous
[16:34:01] <unblockgames> whats a deferred?
[16:34:02] <idlesysop> does anyone know why this $(this).carousel('option', 'autoFlipInterval', 0); throws an error "cannot call methods on carousel prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'" when using jquery ui 1.9?
[16:34:16] <idlesysop> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[16:34:52] <djshotglass> i want to add a 'toolbar' to my pages and to avoid covering content on page i want it able to be moved top left right or bottom and also be collapsed so it just enough visable to click and expand again
[16:34:58] <djshotglass> jqueryui a good idea?
[16:35:06] <djshotglass> im not sure where to start
[16:35:27] <djshotglass> dont want to write it from scratch as it had to look nice and i am a programmer not a designer
[16:38:19] <unblockgames> i dont understand how a deferred would help me
[16:40:22] <shoky> unblockgames:  var req = $.get(whatever);   then whereever you want:  req.done(function(data) { do something with data })
[16:41:32] <unblockgames> isnt that the same thing as using the callback already implemented with get?
[16:41:34] <RohanBhangui> hey shoky nice to see you are still around
[16:42:09] <shoky> unblockgames:  yes, it is, but this is more flexible as you can put the callback wherever you want
[16:42:28] <shoky> unblockgames: anyways, ajax is asynchronous, you do what you do in the callback, not outside of it like you're planning
[16:42:59] <shoky> hey RohanBhangui, likewise
[16:43:28] <ezio> your db is down!!!!
[16:43:30] <ezio> haha
[16:43:57] <ezio> is something wrong with this syntax?
[16:43:58] <ezio> $('.search_field_display').on('click', function () {
[16:44:07] <shoky> nope
[16:44:11] <idlesysop> is anyone here familiar with using _setOption in ui 1.9?
[16:44:42] <idlesysop> when I call $("elem").filterable("option","className","newName"); i get an error cannot call methods on filterable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'
[16:44:52] <idlesysop> this worked in ui 1.8
[16:44:54] <shoky> idlesysop: did you initialize it
[16:45:00] <ezio> shoky, that's not catching clicks from newly created elements
[16:45:12] <shoky> ezio:  that's because you're not using event delegation
[16:45:21] <ezio> wjat
[16:45:25] <idlesysop> apparently not, I never had to initialize it in 1.8, how do I initialize it?
[16:45:27] <ezio> what's that?
[16:45:31] <shoky> ezio: you want something like:  $('#someContainer').on('click', '.search_field_display', function() { ... })
[16:45:36] <unblockgames> shoky ... thank you for saying that last thing
[16:45:42] <shoky> ezio: read about event delegation in http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:45:52] <ezio> yeah i tried but the db is down
[16:45:57] <ezio> i wouldn't have even come here normally
[16:46:00] <sampaka> i cannot get to trigger the native change event of a select box with a programaticaly changed option - sounds familiar to you shoky? ;)
[16:46:01] <shoky> oh
[16:46:03] <unblockgames> it made me realize that i needed to just do what it was i was doing inside the callback
[16:46:09] <ezio> thanks though
[16:46:33] <shoky> ezio: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:47:01] <shoky> unblockgames: indeed, see ?ajax101
[16:47:01] <bot-t> unblockgames, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[16:47:37] <shoky> sampaka: yep ;]
[16:47:47] <RohanBhangui> whats wrong with the api db connection?
[16:47:50] <ezio> shoky, thanks buds
[16:48:41] <sampaka> still no progress with this problem - i difined a custom event that gets triggerd but my ajax does not get fired
[16:48:42] <shoky> idlesysop:  you initialize like this:  $("elem").filterable({...options here...})
[16:48:57] <shoky> idlesysop:  or just .filterable()  to initialize without options
[16:49:13] <idlesysop> yes, it's initiialized
[16:49:38] <shoky> it's initialized by the time you're setting the option?
[16:50:09] <shoky> sampaka: you can't trigger the native event.. you need to find another way to trigger your cms's handler
[16:50:19] <shoky> or hwatever it was that is catching that event
[16:50:34] <idlesysop> yeah, when I invoke it, I'm setting the option to 1000 and then after initialized, I'm trying to change it on hover with .filterable('option', 'theOption', 0)
[16:50:47] <shoky> idlesysop:  setting the option to 1000 how?
[16:51:36] <idlesysop> $('elem').filterable({theOption:1000});
[16:51:47] <shoky> and then it's still saying that it's not initialied?
[16:51:49] <shoky> z
[16:51:50] <idlesysop> yeah
[16:51:54] <shoky> jsfiddle plz
[16:52:36] <shoky> here's one with jquery ui 1.9 already:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/C5Wgu/
[16:56:11] <idlesysop> http://jsfiddle.net/wfSEf/
[16:56:47] <shoky> a fiddle demonstrating the issue..
[16:57:05] <shoky> no idea what that stuff is..
[16:57:17] <idlesysop> that's just how i'm initializing it
[16:57:35] <idlesysop> there's quite a bit of code, once i have it up, i'll get back to you, thanks
[16:57:43] <shoky> it?
[16:58:03] <shoky> no filterable there
[16:58:44] <shoky> one thing that pops out is that you're setting the options inside some 'initialized' callback
[16:58:49] <idlesysop> no, i was just using that as an example
[16:58:53] <shoky> which might run before it's actually initialized ?
[16:59:01] <shoky> hence the issue.. maybe?
[16:59:37] <idlesysop> initialized is triggered at the end of my _create function
[17:00:00] <shoky> yeah.. sounds like the culprit
[17:00:23] <idlesysop> ok, I'll keep playing with it, even if I attempt to just change the option from the console after the widget is invoked, i'm getting the error
[17:00:35] <shoky> actually it's in a hover callback so it's sounding less like the culprit
[17:01:44] <shoky> have you read through the 1.9 upgrade guide?
[17:01:52] <shoky> and checked every single thing? :)
[17:01:57] <idlesysop> no, not yet, i'll take a look, thanks
[17:02:25] <idlesysop> "Error establishing a database connection" guess I'll have to check it later, thanks anyway
[17:02:43] <idlesysop> that is returned when I try to go to: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[17:02:50] <shoky> idlesysop: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Pug2-ACunxUJ:jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk
[17:02:57] <shoky> yea their shit is down right now
[17:02:58] <idlesysop> thanks
[17:07:54] <RohanBhangui> does anyone know whats wrong with he api server?
[17:08:09] <shoky> it's down
[17:09:29] <shoky> google cache is at your service
[17:09:34] <RohanBhangui> true
[17:09:43] <RohanBhangui> or google chrome api offline browser plugin
[17:09:54] <RohanBhangui> shoky:  do you know why?
[17:10:17] <shoky> no
[17:10:36] <shoky> they just updated it yesterday
[17:10:43] <shoky> so it's prolly something to do with that
[17:12:59] <shoky> RohanBhangui: it's back
[17:13:09] <RohanBhangui> nice
[17:13:26] <RohanBhangui> looks much better
[17:14:13] <idlesysop> bah, I figured it out, I was extending the widget factory and calling the parent widget instead of the one that was invoked, thanks again shoky
[17:18:33] <raj> I'm doing $('#mydiv').addClass('content'), and although if I check if it hasClass() afterwards, or console.log $('#mydiv'), I see the class, but when inspecting the element, the class isn't added to the html
[17:18:37] <raj> what's up with that?
[17:19:17] <shoky> console.log $('#mydiv') is same as inspecting it, no?
[17:19:37] <raj> i wanna show you shoky, but I'm at some rent-a-space type place
[17:19:43] <raj> so on public wifi
[17:19:51] <raj> don't think any of their router ports are open
[17:20:37] <shoky> are you inspecting it while the debugger is halted ?
[17:21:12] <shoky> while stopped on a breakpoint or smth, i mean
[17:21:43] <raj> yes, i did debbuger;
[17:21:46] <raj> debugger;
[17:21:53] <raj> and looking at the element there
[17:22:14] <raj> cuz basically, if the element doesn't have that class, it causes the browser to get stuck
[17:22:22] <shoky> ah. well in my experience many times the inspect-view isn't accurate while the debugger is stopped
[17:22:25] <raj> if I add the class directly in the html, then everything works fine
[17:22:39] <raj> but if I add the class using javascript, it doesn't work
[17:23:00] <shoky> wat
[17:23:01] <b-ot> "object literal singleton" can't vs width other two.
[17:23:05] <shoky> what causes the browser to get stuck..
[17:23:11] <raj> I think this is pointless without me showing you
[17:23:14] <raj> I have no idea
[17:23:19] <raj> I can't figure it out
[17:23:24] <shoky> ;S
[17:23:40] <raj> ok, I'm packing up and heading home then, cuz otherwise I'm totally stuck
[17:23:47] <raj> see u seoon
[17:23:51] <shoky> ;p seeya
[17:59:03] <djshotglass> jquery doesnt do cookies?!
[17:59:09] <djshotglass> da faq
[17:59:14] <alwayslearning> hey can anyone tell me why my modal overlay won't pop up? My Jquery script 'ageblock.min.js' should be creating a div called overlay but its not happening. www.quiquor.com
[17:59:20] <djshotglass> im too lazy to parse document.cookie
[17:59:29] <djshotglass> i suppose i could just ajax a cookie.php
[17:59:32] <shoky> then use a plugin
[17:59:37] <shoky> $.cookie
[17:59:39] <djshotglass> php has better functions to parse
[18:00:49] <djshotglass> what do you guys use to minify?
[18:00:50] <shoky> alwayslearning: there IS a div called overlay
[18:01:30] <shoky> alwayslearning: and otherwise.. you expect us to look at minified code?
[18:02:16] <alwayslearning> @shoky there is another js file in the same directory : ageblock.js
[18:02:16] <b-ot> alwayslearning, memorised “there”.
[18:03:23] <shoky> alwayslearning: well it's putting the div there just fine
[18:04:02] <alwayslearning> The divs not working as intended shoky, it should be covering the entire viewable area. Any ideas?
[18:04:38] <shoky> alwayslearning: it has width: 300px; height: 200px; in the css..
[18:05:04] <alwayslearning> Ahhh i'm slow, thanks shoky. Repeated classes *facepalm*
[18:54:33] <dreamingrainbow> can someone help me with autocomplete ... i have this..http://pastebin.com/QenVa9qL
[18:54:47] <dreamingrainbow> but it adds ?terms= and i dont need that
[18:58:45] <danzik17> dreamingrainbow: how do you want the terms sent to the server then?
[18:59:46] <dreamingrainbow> id like to take out the ?terms=
[19:00:10] <dreamingrainbow> because /autocomplete/word ... will show word....
[19:01:00] <danzik17> dreamingrainbow: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source - pass source option a function per those docs and you can customize it however you want
[19:05:04] <dreamingrainbow> uhh ...
[19:05:29] <dreamingrainbow> i dont really mess with jquery much... this is my first real attempt
[19:09:45] <dreamingrainbow> and im completely lost.
[19:14:48] <shoky> dreamingrainbow: it's gonna be hard doing real jquery stuff without knowing jquery
[19:15:23] <dreamingrainbow> well, i do know a bit but my language is php ..
[19:15:41] <shoky> anyways, danzik17 pointed you to what you need to do
[19:16:11] <shoky> so.. start trying that, when you get stuck, show us what you've tried so far
[19:16:27] <shoky> or well
[19:16:38] <shoky> i might have a fiddle lying around that does that
[19:16:48] <danzik17> dreamingrainbow: try this ( untested ): https://gist.github.com/4465001
[19:17:10] <danzik17> i assume your server responds with an array of suggestions in JSON format - if it doesn't adjust the code however you need.
[19:17:11] <hiall> Anyone help me with http://jsfiddle.net/Kx4nh/1/ banging my head against the wall for past hour
[19:17:24] <hiall> It has a recursive error? but im only clicking it once
[19:17:44] <dreamingrainbow> your a life saver i would of spent 8hrs looking for that
[19:19:21] <shoky> hiall: you're triggering a click event from inside a click event handler
[19:19:40] <shoky> hiall: that's what i'd call recursive
[19:20:08] <hiall> o0! hmmn ok thanks shoky
[19:20:22] <hiall> how on earth do you do what im trying to do then?
[19:20:40] <shoky> why are you triggering a click?
[19:20:48] <hiall> i want to hide the file input box
[19:20:49] <shoky> oh type='file'
[19:20:55] <hiall> and make it fire on a click of a item
[19:29:50] <shoky> hiall: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Kx4nh/3/
[19:30:21] <dreamingrainbow> I so could kiss you
[19:30:38] <dreamingrainbow> I have been working on the db and stuff for this for two days....

[19:30:58] <dreamingrainbow> and with your lil code and a few changes i have made it work!!!!!!
[19:31:01] <hiall> thanks shoky!
[19:31:27] <dreamingrainbow> Thanks danzik17
[19:34:58] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/3R5MY/
[19:35:02] <RohanBhangui> hi guys
[19:35:14] <RohanBhangui> the above code is suppose to pick a random number
[19:35:19] <RohanBhangui> and that corresponds to a class
[19:35:26] <RohanBhangui> which is then added to subject div
[19:35:30] <RohanBhangui> why isnt it working
[19:35:46] <shoky> RohanBhangui: why two sets of quotes around each colors?
[19:35:48] <shoky> color
[19:36:23] <gry> The class is updated correctly.
[19:36:27] <RohanBhangui> cause in addclass (if you arent using avariable
[19:36:31] <RohanBhangui> *a variable
[19:36:43] <RohanBhangui> you use addClass("yellow");
[19:36:51] <RohanBhangui> hence the quotes
[19:37:01] <shoky> RohanBhangui: also your css is not good
[19:37:12] <shoky> RohanBhangui:  it applies the class
[19:37:33] <RohanBhangui> well i need an initial color
[19:37:37] <RohanBhangui> and then it changes
[19:37:43] <shoky> then why not have it have class="reD" to begin with
[19:37:52] <RohanBhangui> should i just keep the background color in a seperate class?
[19:37:56] <RohanBhangui> ya hmmm
[19:38:03] <shoky> and remove the red class before adding the random one
[19:38:14] <shoky> or you could just have  #subject.green { ... }  etc
[19:38:34] <shoky> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/3R5MY/1/
[19:38:52] <shoky> it's never gonna choose purple, btw
[19:39:12] <RohanBhangui> why?
[19:39:23] <RohanBhangui> i thought arrays start at 0
[19:39:30] <shoky> because  Math.random() * 5  will never be  5
[19:39:38] <RohanBhangui> ahh
[19:40:05] <shoky> (even if it could be 5..  that would happen with a 0.01% probabilty or someshit)
[19:42:15] <RohanBhangui> kk..thanks shoky..helped me yet again
[20:07:11] <gry> rudedogg,

[20:45:46] <relipse> i need a full page refresh on each tab

[21:05:03] <Smozius> Hello everyone, I suck at jquery. I have modified some code someone else made and am looking to see why it's not working like it should anymore.
[21:05:13] <Smozius> Jfiddle of what I have - http://jsfiddle.net/5EGPf/
[21:05:40] <Smozius> If you click the link 7 times its supposed to say 'Why do you persist on clicking me?'
[21:05:59] <Smozius> However it says the string at 14 clicks instead at 7 clicks
[21:06:15] <Smozius> ignore the grammatical error in the string at 7
[21:07:35] <Smozius> Is the if structure the problem?
[21:09:00] <Mo0O> no the problem is the line 7
[21:09:20] <Mo0O> you increment the counter twice
[21:09:29] <Mo0O> 1rst is line 7
[21:09:40] <Smozius> oh
[21:09:45] <Mo0O> and a 2nd time line 10
[21:10:17] <Mo0O> 'cause the element a don't have any class ;)
[21:10:37] <Mo0O> hope this help
[21:11:10] <Roquentin> is there a website out there that lets me create a list, and add to/delete from that list, and I can also share that list with others who can add to it but not delete from it?
[21:11:43] <Smozius> So then, how would I add a string to the website to show the user the number of clicks they have made?
[21:12:31] <Smozius> I just need to count and then print the variable click_counter
[21:13:39] <Mo0O> Smozius: you could make a div like: <div id="count"></div>, and then somewhere in your code place: $('#count').html(click_counter)
[21:14:03] <Smozius> Roquentin, you could easily setup a PHP / mysql page to allow users to enter information however they wont be able to access the MySQL server to remove it
[21:14:05] <Mo0O> when you when to show|update it
[21:16:07] <Smozius> Would it be wise to create a loop to continously update the #count div?
[21:16:30] <Smozius> Having $('#count').html(click_counter) fire off at each IF works but its at each if
[21:16:46] <Mo0O> Smozius: an example which show the previous mistake -> http://jsfiddle.net/s9sfZ/
[21:17:14] <Smozius> Ah! So it doesnt even need to be in the if
[21:17:38] <Smozius> Very cool, thank you
[21:17:39] <Mo0O> it need to be where you want it ;)
[21:17:47] <Mo0O> no p
[21:27:37] <Mo0O> Smozius: just some few things about jquery, you could replace var jQuery by $ so
[21:28:04] <Mo0O> jQuery('#link1') = $('#link1')
[21:28:21] <Mo0O> and to ensure the document is loaded
[21:28:49] <Mo0O> $(function(){ //your stuff ... };
[21:29:10] <Mo0O> $(function(){ /* your stuff ... */ };
[21:30:47] <Smozius> Alright, is it possible for this jquery script to work with div IDs that are loaded into the page by a php include?
[21:30:57] <Smozius> Or would the script need to be with the PHP include file?
[21:31:05] <tw2113> yes
[21:31:20] <tw2113> all of the php is already run by the time js gets to it
[21:32:01] <Smozius> hm
[21:32:57] <Smozius> Should it matter if the jquery code is in the head vs the body tag?
[21:34:31] <Smozius> I've incorporated the jfiddle code into my web browser but nothing is happening with the link
[21:34:38] <tw2113> ideally, it's best to put it at the end, right before the </body>
[21:35:26] <Smozius> ah
[21:35:29] <Smozius> i moved it to the bottom
[21:35:31] <Smozius> and it works now
[21:35:45] <Smozius> cool
[21:36:22] <becom33> hey Im having a logical issue . I have web app Im working on . its more like a desktop application which has parent child . Im using a JqueryUI dialog boxes as child forms
[21:36:38] <tw2113> probably would have worked at the top if it was wrapped in $(document).ready(function(){ //stuff });
[21:36:55] <Mo0O> grilled ^^
[21:37:03] <Mo0O> 05:18 < Mo0O> $(function(){ /* your stuff ... */ };
[21:37:10] <Smozius> Right
[21:37:18] <Smozius> Does that just go in the header?
[21:37:35] <becom33> the problem is . each child form has deferent deferent heights and widths
[21:37:44] <becom33> Im using a one class for them
[21:37:55] <Mo0O> put it just before </body> ensure the document is load more quickly
[21:38:34] <tw2113> Smozius, it goes around your code, wherever you put it
[21:39:41] <Smozius> Done.
[21:39:49] <Smozius> Thanks for all of your help.
[21:43:53] <Smozius> What if I wanted to add text next to the counter when it shows up?
[21:44:18] <Smozius> If I add it to the div before it adds to itself it will disappear....
[21:45:42] <Smozius> Eh, I guess I can add .show(); to the script and make the div element display: none;
[21:46:38] <Mo0O> you could use append
[21:46:46] <Mo0O> .append()
[21:46:55] <Mo0O> http://api.jquery.com/append/
[21:48:04] <Mo0O> or prepend, depending on what you want - http://api.jquery.com/prepend/ -
[21:48:59] <Smozius> Hmm
[21:52:39] <Smozius> How would you call the variable instead of the prepend text?
[21:53:38] <Smozius> Ex - $("#count").prepend(document.createTextNode("Do you see this number? ($('count')); ); ?
[21:53:45] <Mo0O> the div value ?
[21:54:03] <Smozius> Yeah
[21:56:55] <Smozius> I need an easy way to keep adding new text to the number after the number hits X number
[21:56:58] <Mo0O> Smozius: like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/bGQwh/
[21:57:10] <Mo0O> or
[21:57:40] <Smozius> Yeah I had got that going already
[21:58:00] <Smozius> But I would like the text to change after the number hits another value
[21:58:21] <Mo0O> or that : http://jsfiddle.net/yDnYW/
[22:00:01] <Mo0O> Smozius: not sure I realy undersand what you want ...
[22:00:38] <Smozius> After the prepend text shows up next to the number, if the number hits say 20, have the prepend text get replaced with new text or change
[22:01:03] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/bGQwh/1/
[22:01:25] <tw2113> Smozius,
[22:01:29] <Smozius> Hm
[22:01:36] <Smozius> I had tried something just like that tw2113
[22:01:59] <tw2113> i got it to work
[22:02:03] <Smozius> I saw
[22:02:56] <Smozius> Thank you!
[22:03:06] <tw2113> not the most elegent solution
[22:03:08] <tw2113> but it'd work
[22:03:12] <Smozius> Yeah, it makes sense
[22:03:39] <tw2113> glad I could turn it into spagetti code
[22:03:42] <Smozius> =)
[22:06:20] <rg_arch> so I am trying to do basic jquery with my website and I've hit a snag... no matter what I've tried I can't get the script to work even once...
[22:07:25] <tw2113> ?link
[22:07:26] <bot-t> tw2113, .link() - Link changes to the matched elements to an object. http://api.jquery.com/link/
[22:07:31] <tw2113> book
[22:07:38] <tw2113> rg_arch, have a link to it not working?
[22:07:56] <rg_arch> tw2113: I will show you a pastebin in a second hold on
[22:08:14] <tw2113> a working link would be better
[22:08:23] <tw2113> something that we could see with a js console
[22:08:26] <rg_arch> well... my website isn't "online" yet
[22:08:35] <Mo0O> tw2113: what a good news there's a bot here <3
[22:10:44] <Smozius> Besides styling the entire div, is it possible to style the output of just my number tw2113?
[22:10:58] <tw2113> wrap it in a span
[22:17:51] <rg_arch> tw2113: http://pastebin.com/vf09qtEb I've removed most of the content but kept the basics of what I am having trouble with
[22:18:59] <Smozius> You know Korean rg_arch?

[22:25:46] <mmanrique> np
[22:25:49] <sheilablackrose> if i want to address it by name?
[22:25:58] <sheilablackrose> # this is for id . is for class right
[22:26:02] <sheilablackrose> what about name?
[22:26:34] <mmanrique> then you're looking for an attribute
[22:26:45] <mmanrique> in that case you use the brackets selector
[22:26:53] <sheilablackrose> so i got to do something like get all input type button n check the attribbute name of each right
[22:26:59] <mmanrique> it would be like this $('[name=save]')
[22:27:09] <sheilablackrose> ohhhh
[22:27:11] <sheilablackrose> got it
[22:27:13] <sheilablackrose> thanks you
[22:27:17] <mmanrique> np dude
[22:28:18] <sheilablackrose> thanks again
[22:28:20] <sheilablackrose> take care
[22:28:23] <sheilablackrose> bye bye
[22:28:31] <mmanrique> :D
[22:33:41] <ili> hello! would i come to this chatroom for a javascript question?
[22:33:56] <gry> if you're using jquery, perhaps!
[22:34:32] <ili> i don't even know! i'm just trying to call/fire a javascript file in a html file and I don't know how to do it!
[22:34:55] <ili> if there's a better place to ask would appreciate being pointed in the right direction
[22:35:03] <gry> <script src="path/to/the/file.js" type="text/javascript">
[22:35:14] <ili> ok trying this thx very much
[22:35:23] <gry> and ##javascript might be slightly closer to pure JS than here :)
[22:35:53] <gry> that tag goes in <head> to load it before the page loads, or at the bottom of <body> contents to load after the page loaded, I think
[22:36:16] <gry> (hence any scripts loading stuff onload of the page go at the top)
[22:36:39] <friskd> Hey whats the UI name for a form field where you have a label  and instead of in input, you have just a value thats not editable
[22:37:05] <friskd> its not really a form field i guess.
[22:37:19] <ili> ok i tried putting the link in the head but still no js firing
[22:37:34] <friskd> But i'm trying to use Bootstrap js and     For example for one of the "fields" on my form    I want to it say User ID:    2345
[22:37:51] <friskd> but 2345 is not a text field and its not editable, its just a value.
[22:37:57] <friskd> a display value.
[22:38:01] <ili> http://olamedia.no-ip.org/quench/home.html is the link. i am trying to make the button do a reveal - i'm using the zurb foundation js for reveal. well potentially
[22:38:05] <friskd> is there a term for that?
[22:39:22] <gry> ili: look into your error console https://pastee.org/j2gkm
[22:39:50] <gry> ili: http://olamedia.no-ip.org/quench/jquery.reveal.js 404s
[22:40:51] <ili> cheers! i'm not sure what the error means - obv the file isn't in the right place re your second point though i'm moving that now
[22:41:03] <gry> it simply means there is no file at that url :-)
[22:41:19] <ili> ah ok
[22:41:21] <gry> 404 = not found
[22:41:24] <ili> the file is at that url now
[22:41:52] <ili> what would this mean ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[22:42:12] <gry> ili: I now get https://pastee.org/6uncy and then the previous pasted errors still appear
[22:42:29] <gry> ili: you might have to also include a link to jquery js file
[22:42:56] <ili> oh i see
[22:43:06] <ili> i also am not sure how to do that tbh
[22:43:54] <tw2113> the same as any other js file
[22:43:55] <gry> ili: first snippet at http://www.zurb.com/playground/reveal-modal-plugin links to jquery, and only then to the reveal.js thing
[22:44:28] <gry> ili: you should look for jquery js file on your host, if there is none, add it
[22:44:39] <gry> ili: the reveal thing is a jquery _plugin_ and it needs jquery to work
[22:44:53] <ili> yay! it worked
[22:45:04] <ili> http://olamedia.no-ip.org/quench/home.html
[22:45:14] <ili> thanks so much!
[22:45:28] <gry> you're welcome :)
[22:45:33] <tw2113> you mean you need jQuery to use jQuery plugins?
[22:45:53] <gry> ili: that large encoding error still appears btw
[22:46:38] <gry> tw2113: needs to include a link to jquery.min.js or similar is the impression I'm getting (I have no idea whether jquery is "shipped" with the reveal things)
[22:46:55] <tw2113> :P
[22:46:56] <tw2113> sarcasm
[22:47:02] <gry> :)
[22:47:16] <gry> (with jqplot, it was, i have no ieda about others :P)
[22:47:24] <gry> idea, too
[22:47:45] <ili> gry oh right... what does the large encoding error mean?
[22:48:47] <gry> ili: I'm not particularly positive on that, but following the steps at http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-encoding-declarations may fix it (just an additional meta tag)
[22:49:13] <gry> ili: try adding <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8"> into head tag and reloading the page
[22:49:40] <ili> ok done
[22:50:00] <ili> i don't know how to check error console yet. #trainingwheels
[22:50:31] <gry> console looks good now
[22:50:38] <gry> what browser are you using?
[22:51:01] <ili> firefox
[22:51:08] <ili> sweet!
[22:51:09] <tw2113> woo firebug
[22:51:13] <gry> ok, tools -> web developer tools -> error console
[22:51:25] <tw2113> or the built in if you're adventurous
[22:51:29] <gry> ili: or firebug (although that might be slightly more confusing and need more reading, but it's pretty nice tool)
[22:51:48] <ili> ok cool! i found that. looked clear to me too. so i think i'm getting there. i'm going to make note of both those suggestions thanks guys
[22:52:15] <tw2113> may need to refresh to get them to show up now that the console is displayed
[22:53:28] <Mohsen_Hassani> Hello gusy; Where can I find some jquery right to left multi-level menus? I googled but I just found ways to build it myself. I need some ready ones.
[22:54:51] <azlon> hey guyz anyone kno where i can get free jquery photography/portfolio templates
[22:56:47] <phiz> from the googles
[22:57:37] <azlon> yah done that need more options tho..
[22:58:07] <tw2113> does jquery do templating?
[23:00:09] <azlon> i mean templates with jslider e.t.c
[23:03:34] <xenome> anyone know how to get the .ajax function to encode spaces as %20 vice +'s?
[23:03:55] <xenome> i can encode it ahead of time with encodeURI, but then the ajax call double encodes the % from %20
[23:11:16] <DrDank> Uhm.. anyone used jQuery to STRETCH(auto fill) the heights in a certian div? Ive only found one code that seems to work.. and it still has a small gap in between the divs at the bottom.. I need it to completely touch the other div.
[23:17:14] <tw2113> ?g jquery backstretch
[23:17:15] <bot-t> tw2113, Backstretch: a simple jQuery plugin that allows you to add a ... - http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/

[23:28:55] <bot-t> Mo0O, (The usage of second argument of jQuery( html [ , ownerDocument ] )) - Opened 2 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11420
[23:30:47] <DrDank> tw2113, Would you be availble to help a person in need? ;) I don't think it would be to hard.. but I am VERY inexperienced in jQuery. :-\ I have a 'snipplet' that auto stretchs a css div on page load.. Would there be a way to get the height of another div and make the one being streched stop at that certian height? --- or stretch them both the same amount.. so I can keep the divs the same
[23:30:47] <DrDank> height? Would be very much appricated... ... anyone? been stuck on this all night.. read for hours on how to do it with css.. and it seems to be all a crock.. besides the last method.. and I just dont have a crap load of extra time to pratice that method and still not perfect it.
[23:37:40] <tw2113> find a way to grab the dimensions of one part, and use them to dynamically style the other part
[23:40:30] <DrDank> haha, thats like rocket science to me.. I'm doing good to be using jquery plugins and having them work correctly.. lol.. Ive found a couple different snipplets.. but none of them seem to work the way I need them too.

[23:43:14] <DrDank> lol, well I guess I'll keep searching.. I wouldn't know how to compare them or anything.. like I said I do good to get plugins to work.. just learning.. hell I had no idea jquery would be capable of doing that.. and I ran across it during a search.
[23:45:56] <angryasian> hello all
[23:47:59] <DrDank> hello angryasian, hope your having a better night/day than me.. lol :P
[23:51:03] <angryasian> lol. what seems to be the issue DrDank?
