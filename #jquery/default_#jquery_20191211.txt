[04:36:38] <Aina021> Hi
[04:51:20] <Aina021> I got a weird error, when i run my jquery file for mobile version every thing is working good and i don't see any problem, until i am deploying in test server and then when i change my select option everything is break :-/ i don't know how can i be able to debug it
[04:57:30] <Cork> Aina021: take the mobile browser and enable remote debuggin connect  and see what error you gets
[04:58:16] <Cork> ex. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging
[05:51:39] <sine0> hey Cork
[05:52:43] <sine0> when this error appears in console, does it mean a conflict with jquery being loaded: jquery.mobile.custom.js:44 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'concat' of undefined
[05:53:12] <sine0> undefined normally means problem with the jQuery/$
[05:53:28] <sine0> im just guessing and stringing together things in my head from previous errors
[05:53:42] <Cork> undefined means the variable left of the dot is undefined
[05:53:58] <Cork> if the variable to the left is $ is means jquery isn't loaded when the code runs
[05:54:13] <Cork> *it means*
[05:56:34] <Cork> that said, i don't think jquery movile or ui adds concat and jquery doesn't provide it
[05:56:49] <Cork> so it is most likely your trying to modify an array, that isn't defined
[06:06:07] <sine0> roger that, just checking into it
[06:06:09] <sine0> thanks
[06:14:50] <Aina021> thanks :)
[09:08:35] <Wilfredor> hi, I have jquery 3.3.1, where I could find all deprecated functions from the all old versions ?
[09:17:40] <Cork> Wilfredor: it is listed in api.jquery.com
[09:18:05] <Cork> (check left side)
[09:26:20] <Kristjan1291983> Hello
[09:26:40] <Kristjan1291983> Is there a function to get the next spectre color to a given html color
[09:26:42] <Kristjan1291983> ?
[09:28:38] <Cork> there might be a plugin, but not built in
[09:29:38] <Cork> thought to be honest i don't really see how it has anything to do with jquery
[09:30:23] <Kristjan1291983> Damn
[09:30:37] <Kristjan1291983> I thought Jquery is enough powerful
[09:30:38] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[09:30:46] <Kristjan1291983> making a game
[09:30:54] <Kristjan1291983> circles moving changing colors
[09:30:54] <Cork> it is, it just isn't for that aria
[09:31:25] <Cork> jquery is for dom manipulation, mainly
[09:31:35] <Cork> plus setting som random css values
[09:34:53] <Kristjan1291983> ok. but how to get all spectre colors ?
[09:43:08] <Kristjan1291983> okey... i have a question now... how to turn rgb(x,y,z) to html color code like #XYZ ?
[09:44:11] <Kristjan1291983> hex
[09:57:24] <Uhkis> just do a regular decimal to hex conversion
[10:00:16] <Wilfredor> merci Cork
[11:47:15] <robertparkerx> I don't know much but a list is using ui-sortable unsortable ui-sortable-handle. For some reason the drag & drog sortable isn't working on tablet and mobile.
[12:43:15] <Cork> robertparkerx: for mobile you need to add som extra code so it works with touch
[12:43:36] <Cork> robertparkerx: and for tables the handle has nowhere to insert to it can't handle it
[12:47:42] <robertparkerx> So it won't handle tablets but it will mobile?
[12:47:51] <robertparkerx> Can you show me the extra code needed?
[15:12:54] <robertparkerx> Cork it seems like all I needed was touch punch
[15:13:00] <robertparkerx> It's working now
[15:32:04] <Wilfredor> $element.children(':first') is the same to tell $element.children().first()  ???
[15:32:22] <robertmaxrees> could always test to find out :)
[15:32:55] <Wilfredor> thanks but I preffer ask before to be sure
[15:33:11] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle is a great tool to test stuff like this.
[15:33:42] <Wilfredor> Excellent thanks for your comment, it was better than tell google is your friend
[15:34:04] <robertmaxrees> drop the tude, my dude :) teaching you how to fish - it's all gravy.
[15:34:54] <Wilfredor> thanks Jesus
[15:35:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:35:15] <Wilfredor> it was just a joke
[15:35:28] <robertmaxrees> no way for me to tell, holmes :)
[15:38:33] <Wilfredor> Sorry
[15:49:56] <Wilfredor> yes its the same
[15:49:57] <Wilfredor> http://jsfiddle.net/914nvf7x/
[15:50:08] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:50:26] <robertmaxrees> invalid markup there btw :)
[15:51:06] <Wilfredor> done http://jsfiddle.net/914nvf7x/1/
[15:52:10] <factor> When I use $(TAG_NAME_HERE).on({ FUNCTION_GOES_HERE  });  I can only use the event once. Do I need to register event someother method to keep it going?
[15:52:51] <factor> for example { touchstart: function(e) { etc...
[16:06:10] <robertmaxrees> factor what do you mean?
[16:06:42] <robertmaxrees> "only use the event once" - could you clarify
[16:07:15] <factor> robertmaxrees, I had setup debug for my Android device, the console log only shows 1 touch start 77 touch move 1 touch end events, but then never shows this again.
[16:07:29] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing your test case?
[16:08:06] <factor> I do have it online my local system .
[16:08:15] <robertmaxrees> great!  can we see the JS?
[16:08:54] <factor> http://47.217.151.184:8080/  The wordsearch puzzle. Dont have the code online yet but will paste it
[16:10:23] <factor> https://pastebin.com/2d7NTw5S
[16:11:34] <factor> I have it working for mouse events , just not touch events.
[16:13:12] <factor> shoud be able to right click and get cleickcheck4.js from the page source
[16:13:19] <factor> for full source
[16:13:28] <factor> clickcheck4.even
[16:15:14] <robertmaxrees> for starters - fix those JS errors.
[16:15:16] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:15:41] <factor> that is just a page transition error, Im not using it right now.
[16:15:46] <factor> I can disable the plugin
[16:16:15] <robertmaxrees> sure, but because of the way your code is setup, errors like that can cause problems.
[16:17:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm not able to see the puzzle on mobile.
[16:17:36] <factor> robertmaxrees, correct its for tablet first. Will have to recode for smartphone
[16:17:53] <factor> moble tablet yes mobile smartphone no
[16:17:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:18:11] <robertmaxrees> sorry - when you said "android device" i wasn't clear what you meant.
[16:18:23] <factor> Disabled plugin , so errors shoudl be gone
[16:18:28] <factor> check
[16:18:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm still not seeing the puzzle using tablet emulation in chrome.
[16:18:55] <factor> humm.
[16:19:17] <factor> I can see it on my tablet Samsung galaxy
[16:19:33] <factor> oh in landscape view
[16:20:05] <robertmaxrees> do you see that error that happens when you touch?
[16:20:36] <factor> You shoudl only get console log saying you touched it
[16:20:42] <factor> not error only info
[16:20:45] <robertmaxrees> i get that, as well as an error.
[16:20:50] <factor> is it an error for you
[16:20:56] <factor> humm
[16:20:58] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/7cCDwoF.png
[16:20:59] <factor> What error?
[16:21:01] <factor> Thanks
[16:21:08] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not filtering things out in your dev tools.
[16:21:17] <robertmaxrees> but that's probably your issue.
[16:21:52] <factor> ok , yes an error would cause it to fail.
[16:22:50] <factor> robertmaxrees, Thanks will look into this.
[16:41:43] <grid-> $('.bootprompt > .modal-backdrop').css('z-index','160');
[16:41:46] <grid-> is this valid?
[16:41:52] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:56:58] <factor> robertmaxrees, yes, that error was clogging the events. I imagine due to being mouse specific. Will the deeper functions for touch position as well.
[17:01:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:54:31] <Flyste> I have a <form> with a bunch of inputs, is there a way I can do an ajax call and send all the variables in the data: part of the ajax call?
[17:54:44] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:54:53] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to do :)
[17:55:23] <Flyste> How ?
[17:55:55] <Flyste> Aside from copying each form input ID and putting the .val() for each one
[17:56:10] <robertmaxrees> well, it depends.
[17:56:14] <robertmaxrees> what kind of format do you want?
[17:56:27] <Flyste> Regular post Data
[17:56:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:56:33] <Flyste> text only
[17:58:40] <Flyste> Damn I got ot run, I will have to figure this out later
[17:58:41] <robertmaxrees> could use serialize(
[17:58:49] <robertmaxrees> search google - lots of info ;)
[23:11:49] <Jonno_FTW> how do I get those <td> that have a data-field attribute?
[23:12:36] <Jonno_FTW> nvm
