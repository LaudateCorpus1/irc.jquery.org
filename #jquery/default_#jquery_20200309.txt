[06:19:58] <Phruis> hello
[06:20:07] <Phruis> how can i zoom my web page with js?
[06:20:59] <Robdgreat> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/setZoom
[06:21:34] <Robdgreat> sorry it took so long
[06:22:19] <Robdgreat> though not strictly a jquery question
[06:28:06] <Phruis> Robdgreat, no problem have you used this before
[06:28:28] <Robdgreat> no, I just googled for it
[06:28:44] <Robdgreat> but it purports to have broad support
[06:29:33] <Robdgreat> I was being a bit facetious about the delay
[06:29:43] <Robdgreat> in that it was less than a minute
[06:38:25] <Phruis> Robdgreat, gotcha ...haha hard to know on irc
[06:55:11] <Cork> uh you know that is webextension right?
[06:55:18] <Cork> as in not from a webpage
[06:56:15] <Cork> Phruis: what are you trying to do exactly?
[06:58:29] <Robdgreat> Cork: I guess I'm an idiot. Someone else should have spoken up
[09:47:31] <C2CNL> Hey folks, anyone else running into the issue that jQuery validate doesn't apply the validClass ?
[10:16:36] <Phruis> Cork, was just trying to increase font size for old people
[10:16:40] <Phruis> or hard of seeing
[10:16:58] <Phruis> but i changed to simply changing the main containers font size via css
[23:21:34] <errorous> if I know that at one point <div id="foobar"> is going to be removed with js and re-added, is there a way to catch that event?
[23:22:00] <errorous> $("body").on('DOMSubtreeModified', "#foobar", function() { didn't help
[23:22:25] <robertmaxrees> because it's deprecated.
[23:22:26] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[23:22:33] <robertmaxrees> can't use jquery for it tho
[23:22:47] <errorous> damn :(
[23:22:51] <errorous> thanks robertmaxrees
[23:22:53] <robertmaxrees> and depending on the use case
[23:22:58] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to use that, either.
[23:23:07] <errorous> why?
[23:23:23] <errorous> Another jquery script is removing that node, and adding a new one. A script I can't change
[23:23:45] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to worry about that node getting removed?
[23:24:10] <errorous> robertmaxrees I don't, as long as I know when it's being re-added
[23:24:23] <robertmaxrees> lol so why do you need to worry about that happening?
[23:24:38] <robertmaxrees> wondering if, for instance, you're trying to re-bind event listeners.
[23:24:40] <errorous> because I wanna change it after it's added
[23:24:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  interesting.
[23:25:20] <errorous> and I can't change original script because it's woocoomerce plugin, and it needs to be updated every once in a while
[23:25:24] <errorous> and no, there's no filter for it
[23:25:49] <robertmaxrees> it was worth checking :)  sometimes there are better solutions.
[23:25:55] <errorous> it's a datepicker that gets end time html every time you change start time
[23:26:23] <errorous> and I basicaly need to remove some options from <select
[23:26:31] <errorous> and <select is in that html
[23:27:32] <errorous> so, mutation observer is my only hope?
[23:28:44] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a crappy plugin.
[23:28:47] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, pretty much.
[23:29:17] <errorous> plugin is quite good. it's just that they couldn't be bothered to add a filter for this
[23:29:37] <errorous> lazy-ass wc devs
[23:29:51] <errorous> no pun intended
[23:31:52] <robertmaxrees> oh, wc as in "water closet" heh.
[23:31:54] <robertmaxrees> took me a sec.
[23:32:58] <errorous> admit you don't often see ass and wc next to each other in legit dev conversations :)
[23:33:33] <robertmaxrees> I mean, I'm in the US where we don't really called them that soooo ;)
[23:33:38] <robertmaxrees> *call
[23:34:24] <errorous> oh, right, yeah, I forgot you were always trying to re-form English :P
[23:34:53] <robertmaxrees> hey, at least some of ours kept the original accent :B
[23:36:21] <errorous> I lived in SF for a few months, and whenever my friend said: Let's go watch some footbal, my first thought was that we're actually gonna watch football, not american football
[23:36:22] <errorous> :)
[23:36:48] <robertmaxrees> aluminum :P
