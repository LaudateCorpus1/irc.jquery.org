[00:01:29] <compact> ah thats what it will be then
[00:02:04] <compact> how do i make it appear, no matter the id (so if they are the same)
[00:02:05] <Cork> compact: so change id="trailer_type" to class="trailer_type"
[00:02:17] <Cork> and use the original selector
[00:02:45] <compact> champ. thanks

[01:58:07] <dimi1947> how can I exit the loop in such a a case?
[01:58:32] <Cork> return false;
[02:29:38] <gonebro> what do u do when u bob aroudnd to alchol and yo're done
[02:41:20] <gonebro> ok
[02:42:02] <gonebro> fuck it
[02:42:52] <gonebro> i got it
[02:42:55] <gonebro> i need statas
[02:42:58] <gonebro> come on
[02:46:57] <gonebro> HELLO
[02:54:16] <Meir`> gonebro, how's the feeling to be a troll?
[03:41:38] <hellyeah> are you using append function or appendto
[03:44:38] <hellyeah> cann we do nested function in jquery?_
[05:10:48] <sash_> Hey, everyone. i could need some help with a form.
[05:11:42] <sash_> I call a serverside function via ajax and get back the correct results, when I press the submit button. now I want to send the form data via post as if nothing happened if the user presses ok, and not when he presses cancel.
[05:11:46] <sash_> *clicks
[05:12:02] <tash> http://pastebin.com/P8ivbD5v if data does equal "OK" can I add an else that actually does the default, which is a post to a different php script than my .get?
[05:12:26] <tash> lol, I think we asked about the same question, relatively close anyway.... sash_
[05:12:48] <tash> and our names are eerily similar, how odd
[05:12:49] <sash_> I set "event.preventDefault()" on the function, which I bind to the click event of the submit button and I want to $("form").submit if(confirm(message)) is true
[05:12:52] <sash_> lol
[05:13:21] <sash_> That's actually frickin the same question
[05:13:38] <tash> at basically the same time, wth
[05:15:11] <sash_> That's mine: https://jsfiddle.net/8um2wton/
[05:15:40] <tash> yours is much more sophisticated than mine lol
[05:15:52] <sash_> Well, https://jsfiddle.net/8um2wton/1/ is more correct
[05:16:29] <tash> basically you are doing the same thing though huh?  I had a form that was already written that did POST, but no verification of something specific.  So, I added .get for that...but if that all checks out I want the POST to happen
[05:16:50] <tash> brb
[05:17:10] <sash_> I needed  to write server side rest function stuff because this validation _neeeeeeeds_ to be done on the frontend -.-
[05:18:27] <sash_> unbind of the click seems not to do anything
[05:23:46] <sash_> tash: Got it
[05:26:12] <sash_> tash: http://fpaste.org/237620/14355807/
[05:26:39] <sash_> tash: in short: if (confirm(message)) is true, unbind the click event, call click, done
[05:26:57] <sash_> tash: Gotta checkout the first part now.
[05:29:17] <hellyeah> so
[05:29:20] <hellyeah> anyone here
[05:31:56] <sash_> hellyeah: hell yeah
[05:32:10] <hellyeah> humm
[05:32:38] <hellyeah> $(this).parent().parent()
[05:32:55] <hellyeah> $(this).parent().children()
[05:33:27] <hellyeah> $(this).parent().findclass('foo');
[05:33:41] <hellyeah> $(this).parent().findclass('foo').children.clone(true);
[05:34:10] <hellyeah> it is all about traversing the tree and finding element yo wish and clone to somewhere that you stlye in css
[05:34:12] <hellyeah> right
[05:34:21] <hellyeah> for example pop up boxes
[05:34:46] <hellyeah> why we use removeclass()
[05:34:56] <tash> sash_ I'll check into it later, you usually around?
[05:34:56] <hellyeah> i am really newbie btw
[05:35:11] <tash> on vacation and heading to an amusement park in a bit with family
[05:36:11] <hellyeah> sash_:  any comment?
[05:44:14] <TeddyMurray> hellyeah, sorry what was your question?
[05:44:45] <hellyeah> just a sec
[05:44:49] <hellyeah> i am beginner btw
[05:44:55] <hellyeah> this is my first day with jquery
[05:44:58] <TeddyMurray> i use $(this).parent().find('.foo')
[05:44:59] <TeddyMurray> cool
[05:45:03] <TeddyMurray> im happy to help
[05:45:19] <TeddyMurray> yes you can chain functions
[05:46:07] <tash> sash_ did it work for you btw?
[05:46:10] <hellyeah> $(this).parent().parent(), $(this).parent().children() ,  $(this).parent().findclass('foo');, #(this).parent().findclass('foo').children.clone(true); ,  it is all about traversing the tree and finding element yo wish and clone to somewhere that you stlye in css like pop up boxes
[05:46:27] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  this was my question
[05:47:06] <TeddyMurray> findClass doesnt exist as a function, its find(".class");
[05:47:17] <TeddyMurray> and children needs a children();
[05:47:27] <TeddyMurray> then yes, you can clone it
[05:47:43] <hellyeah> find but there are removeclass right
[05:47:48] <TeddyMurray> removeClass
[05:47:58] <hellyeah> camelCase you are right
[05:47:59] <TeddyMurray> most functions begin with a lower case letter, then the next word has a uppercase
[05:48:42] <TeddyMurray> yep, camelCase ^_^
[05:48:46] <hellyeah> i watched video from try jquey
[05:48:48] <hellyeah> i watched video from try jquery
[05:49:25] <hellyeah> so in pop up boxes for example you create table and you clone the content that you want with clone
[05:49:35] <hellyeah> ofc there is some other things you do
[05:49:47] <hellyeah> but main point is to get content that you want
[05:49:51] <TeddyMurray> well children() returns an array
[05:49:53] <hellyeah> from DOM
[05:50:04] <hellyeah> well
[05:50:05] <TeddyMurray> yes, you can transverse the DOM
[05:50:24] <TeddyMurray> if you ran children().clone() it would clone every class that exists. i think
[05:51:26] <hellyeah> $(this).parent().children().data("foo").clone(true)
[05:51:38] <hellyeah> can you combine javascript function with jquery function?
[05:52:11] <Zephree>  Hi All, I'm having a small spot of trouble, I am using $("#divID").css("display", "none"); - which is hiding what I want, but then it just leaves a blank spot. If I resize my window at all the white space is consumed. Is there some kind of update or re-draw I can force?
[05:52:20] <TeddyMurray> not chaining it, no
[05:52:29] <hellyeah> ic
[05:53:20] <TeddyMurray> Zephree, sounds like the parent div needs to be resized when it hides. can you pastebi?
[05:53:23] <TeddyMurray> pastebin*
[05:54:39] <Zephree> It's part of a userscript I wrote that changes a website I'm visiting. :/ I'll try to resize their div again. It just seemed odd that if I resize the screen at all it corrects itself.
[05:55:36] <TeddyMurray> oh i see, try .remove() ?
[05:55:38] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  can you suggest me to read another thing i already watched video from try jquery
[05:55:42] <TeddyMurray> that will take it out of the DOM entirely
[05:56:45] <TeddyMurray> hellyeah, http://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/jquery try this site. i used it to learn jquery. it makes you fast at it
[05:56:58] <TeddyMurray> http://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/jquery/cheatsheet here are all the commands it teaches you
[05:58:38] <TeddyMurray> jquery is best learned by practicing, and googling, though
[05:58:43] <TeddyMurray> what are you building hellyeah?
[05:59:06] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:
[05:59:36] <sash_> Zephree: Just change the opacity to 0
[05:59:39] <hellyeah> http://www.sitepoint.com/14-jquery-modal-dialog-boxes/
[05:59:44] <hellyeah> something like that
[05:59:50] <TeddyMurray> i use jqueryui $.dialog
[05:59:54] <hellyeah> they will be row of table that is selected
[05:59:56] <TeddyMurray> its pretty slick
[06:00:12] <sash_> Zephree: Oh, that would leave the spot as a whole, I misunderstood your question
[06:01:05] <sash_> Zephree: As TeddyMurray wrote, what you want is .remove() if you don't need the element anymore. Got that sort of stuff in a userscript, too.
[06:01:29] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  http://jsfiddle.net/ar6kxkfd/ i have smt like that click kvirc.com
[06:01:34] <Zephree> sash_ and TeddyMurray, OH thank you, I'll give .remove() a quick try, I forgot that was a thing
[06:01:35] <hellyeah> kvirc.net
[06:02:23] <TeddyMurray> awesome hellyeah
[06:02:38] <TeddyMurray> siblings() also returns an array
[06:02:53] <hellyeah> i actually wrote some stuff here and i get some help
[06:03:27] <hellyeah> simple one actually
[06:03:30] <hellyeah> yes
[06:03:32] <TeddyMurray> well ive been having a bad day, helping people makes me feel better... $("#teddymurray").attr("mood","happy");
[06:04:24] <TeddyMurray> just clicked the URLAddress, seems to work pretty good
[06:04:34] <TeddyMurray> but if you had multiple rows, it would copy all of them i think
[06:04:45] <sash_> Zephree: This is such an "optimization" script I use for a german it news website: http://fpaste.org/237631/35583057/
[06:05:09] <TeddyMurray> cool sash_
[06:05:35] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:
[06:05:40] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:05:56] <sash_> "Well, I don't want to see … this … and this… and that… and this stuff… and that … this … "
[06:06:24] <TeddyMurray> $(this).find(".that").remove(); ;)
[06:06:49] <sash_> ;)
[06:07:38] <TeddyMurray> hellyeah, i was wrong
[06:07:47] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:08:42] <TeddyMurray> looks like using eq(i) handles the issue
[06:09:48] <TeddyMurray> you're pretty good at jquery for 1 day =]
[06:10:00] <hellyeah> actually it is my actual table can you give me some tipes why it didnt work http://jsfiddle.net/ar6kxkfd/2/
[06:10:19] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  actually someone help me here i try to understand whole concept
[06:11:27] <Zephree> Stupid question... is there a way to see what script functions are being called if no output is being sent to the console? I'd like to try to figure out what they're running when the page get resized
[06:12:30] <sash_> Zephree: console.log
[06:13:00] <sash_> Zephree: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15270177/4858962
[06:13:35] <TeddyMurray> hellyeah, not sure, what is it supposed to do?
[06:13:55] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:14:00] <hellyeah> when you click image
[06:14:08] <hellyeah> it should view pop up boxes actually
[06:14:29] <TeddyMurray> messing with it now
[06:16:23] <ceramicskulls> Is there a way to see the whole json object in console without it getting alphabetized?
[06:17:44] <ceramicskulls> It showss the snippet of the object, but when I try to view the whole object it just alphabetizes it and makes it harder to try and figure out what is what since I'm working with a lot of integers . _ .
[06:18:43] <Cork> ceramicskulls: what happens when you view the object depends on the debugger
[06:19:48] <ceramicskulls> Cork: well, it's happening on all consoles ;[
[06:25:34] <TeddyMurray> hellyeah, .cell-which-triggers-popup doesnt exist in the DOM
[06:25:42] <TeddyMurray> those images are basically just <a href='s
[06:26:00] <hellyeah> ah yes
[06:28:18] <hellyeah> ic
[06:28:55] <TeddyMurray> http://jsfiddle.net/ar6kxkfd/3/
[06:28:58] <TeddyMurray> click the 1st one
[06:29:15] <TeddyMurray> also add return false; at the end of the click and it wont follow the link
[06:29:34] <sash_> Nah …
[06:29:43] <sash_> add event.preventDefault
[06:29:50] <TeddyMurray> or that, i like return false better =]
[06:30:01] <sash_> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[06:30:53] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  is it for me?
[06:31:06] <TeddyMurray> event.preventDefault is the proper way to do it
[06:31:26] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  co content here?
[06:31:31] <hellyeah> no content.
[06:31:42] <TeddyMurray> sorry what?
[06:32:31] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/ar6kxkfd/3/
[06:32:34] <hellyeah> click to image
[06:32:42] <TeddyMurray> oh, that's a separate issue, i dont know why its not copying the table i didnt look into that
[06:32:44] <hellyeah> you wont see no content on pop up boxes
[06:32:47] <TeddyMurray> just noticed that the class didnt exist
[06:33:24] <hellyeah> which class?
[06:33:31] <TeddyMurray> .cell-which-triggers-popup
[06:33:53] <hellyeah> ah yeah forgot that one sorry about that
[06:34:10] <hellyeah> when you click image you should get all row into pop up boxes actually
[06:34:58] <hellyeah> could you help me?
[06:35:17] <TeddyMurray> =[ you want me to code for you? i usually charge $60/hr
[06:35:42] <TeddyMurray> kidding, give me a minute need to step out
[06:36:05] <TeddyMurray> maybe sash_ can help
[06:36:26] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  you dont have to help me thats totally fine actually hehe
[06:36:40] <hellyeah> :XD
[06:36:51] <hellyeah> it would be nice if you help me :XD
[06:40:15] <TeddyMurray> http://jsfiddle.net/ar6kxkfd/5/ much simpler version, then style the table
[06:40:28] <TeddyMurray> oops, add event.preventDefault();
[06:42:01] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  sorry for that but i actually need appearence like this http://jsfiddle.net/ar6kxkfd/
[06:42:10] <hellyeah> but thanks anyway :XD

[06:51:00] <Gorge> Hello. I'm using jEditable and I want to edit 2 input/data and after SAVE all data with PHP. It's posible?
[06:51:54] <TeddyMurray> hellyeah, dont worry im still thinking. im surprised you were able to code this
[06:52:57] <Gorge> Thanks, I want to SAVE all data with only button
[06:55:39] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  thank you
[06:56:05] <Gorge> Hello. I'm using jEditable and I want to edit 2 input/data and after SAVE all data with only button. It's posible?
[07:06:01] <ceramicskulls> I'm using $.each to append my values from an object, how can I append the key and return false so it doesn't continue appending it? http://jsfiddle.net/w8kkoq2y/
[07:06:27] <Gorge> Hello. I'm using jEditable and I want to edit 2 input/data and after SAVE all data with only button. It's posible?
[07:06:50] <TeddyMurray> Gorge, im helping someone else, but maybe make a jsfiddle for us? sounds like you need to keep a json array copy of the data
[07:08:18] <Gorge> TeddyMurray ok, I wait but please..! I didn't anythink : http://pastebin.com/ypxk3tb9
[07:08:46] <Cork> ceramicskulls: why would you need each to add a key to an object?
[07:11:53] <ceramicskulls> Cork: I'm trying to add the key to create a table of data
[07:12:10] <ceramicskulls> Unless I'm doing it wrong? :l
[07:12:12] <Cork> and why not just obj[key] = value?
[07:12:17] <bnzaaap> hey I'm trying to get pep to work but it doesn't
[07:12:20] <bnzaaap> any idea?
[07:12:26] <arthurvr> bnzaaap: where is it going wrong?
[07:12:29] <Cork> or obj.keyName = value
[07:12:54] <bnzaaap> things just stay undefined it seems
[07:13:01] <arthurvr> check the console
[07:13:05] <bnzaaap> nothing :((
[07:13:17] <ceramicskulls> Cork: Well I'm trying to make the table header into a column rather than a row
[07:13:17] <arthurvr> is pep loading before your actual scripts?
[07:13:29] <bnzaaap> that's it
[07:13:31] <Cork> ceramicskulls: ok?
[07:13:31] <bnzaaap> thanks arthurvr
[07:13:38] <bnzaaap> works like expectted now
[07:13:44] <bnzaaap> huggeee thanks
[07:13:50] <arthurvr> my pleasure
[07:13:56] <bnzaaap> pep's pretty cool
[07:14:19] <bnzaaap> bye
[07:14:24] <bnzaaap> that was a quick one
[07:14:33] <arthurvr> bye-bye
[07:15:58] <ceramicskulls> Cork: did you see the fiddle? This is my first time working with JSON data and outputting results so I may be doing it wrong.
[07:16:18] <Cork> ah, no i did not
[07:17:09] <Cork> ceramicskulls: so you want the first key and nothing else?
[07:17:18] <Cork> result.keys[0]
[07:17:20] <Cork> in that case
[07:23:08] <redel> what is the best way to access nodes in DOM?
[07:23:29] <TeddyMurray> hellyeah,
[07:23:29] <TeddyMurray> http://jsfiddle.net/ar6kxkfd/6/ hope this is right
[07:23:36] <TeddyMurray> redel, selectors
[07:24:50] <Cork> redel: you normally don't work with nodes, you work with elements
[07:25:12] <Cork> and there isn't really a good way to work with nodes
[07:25:18] <Cork> only the use them directly
[07:26:26] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  yes thats right
[07:26:35] <ceramicskulls> Cork: Sorry, I don't really get what you're trying to tell me :\ but here is a more updated version. I'm sure you probably understand what I'm trying to do, but I don't :D http://jsfiddle.net/w8kkoq2y/2/
[07:27:12] <hellyeah> preventbydefault
[07:27:40] <Zeranoe> Does jquery support printing a specified pdf document when clicking a button?
[07:28:34] <Cork> Zeranoe: jquery does dom modifications
[07:28:52] <Cork> Zeranoe: the browser is the one handling loading resources/printing
[07:29:21] <Cork> Zeranoe: so do answer the question, no you can't print a specific pdf from jquery
[07:29:26] <Zeranoe> Cork: I know you can open the print dialog box using javascript. Can you change the document to be printed?
[07:29:30] <Cork> you can trigger a load of the url
[07:29:41] <Cork> but what the browser does with it is out of you're control
[07:29:48] <Cork> Zeranoe: no
[07:30:07] <Cork> Zeranoe: the browser doesn't even do the rendering on the pdf most of the time
[07:30:18] <Cork> as pdf isn't a web native format
[07:30:29] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  $("td").eq(i).html gives the content of td right
[07:30:39] <TeddyMurray> yes
[07:30:46] <TeddyMurray> could use clone()
[07:31:12] <hellyeah> clone() instead of html?
[07:31:13] <Zeranoe> Cork: I'm generating the pdf server side, so my best option would probably be to generate a page that can be printed and open the print dialog box with a click/action?
[07:31:27] <Cork> Zeranoe: ya
[07:31:35] <TeddyMurray> either works i think
[07:31:38] <TeddyMurray> i use html()
[07:31:45] <Cork> or just open the pdf and let the user click print in the client
[07:31:55] <redel> can I add jquery in mono c#
[07:31:57] <redel> ?
[07:32:22] <hellyeah> TeddyMurray:  can i ask one last question?
[07:32:28] <TeddyMurray> yes sure
[07:33:05] <hellyeah> how can i remove image from pup up box?
[07:33:35] <Zeranoe> Cork: I've seen pages print different than what is being displayed (different elements are not included, etc). Is that controlled through javascript?
[07:33:44] <TeddyMurray> skip the first index
[07:33:51] <TeddyMurray> if ( i === ) // skip
[07:33:54] <TeddyMurray> i = 0
[07:34:00] <Cork> Zeranoe: css
[07:34:07] <Cork> media="print"
[07:34:39] <Cork> Zeranoe: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Printing
[07:35:14] <Zeranoe> Cork: Thanks
[07:36:44] <malade_mental> what's the difference between $.each(element,function() {
[07:36:56] <malade_mental> }); and elem.each(function() { } );
[07:36:57] <malade_mental> ?
[07:37:00] <Cork> none
[07:37:08] <Cork> well one
[07:37:12] <malade_mental> ah!
[07:37:17] <ceramicskulls> Cork: I was following this example; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9760661/jquery-code-to-display-json-response-to-a-html-table-using-append but it doesn't really show how I can append the key once to create the header also in a readable format
[07:37:21] <Cork> $.each() doesn't return elem
[07:37:26] <Cork> elem.each() does
[07:37:37] <Abhijit> hi
[07:37:43] <malade_mental> and each of them work with "$(this)" ?
[07:38:10] <Abhijit> can i break a html5 video at given time period and start playing same videos with differnt quality from that time onwards?
[07:38:11] <Cork> ceramicskulls: could you make a working example with what you're dealing with? (without the ajax call)
[07:38:14] <Abhijit> using jquery that is
[07:38:17] <Cork> malade_mental: yes
[07:38:23] <ceramicskulls> Kk
[07:38:41] <Cork> ceramicskulls: $.map and $().map has a bigger difference though
[07:38:44] <Cork> be careful there
[07:39:04] <malade_mental> thanks :]
[07:39:22] <Cork> $.map() doesn't set this for example
[07:39:33] <Cork> and the argument order differs
[07:47:18] <_anli> Is there an event that occurs when an item is selected in a textbox dropdown
[07:47:19] <_anli> ?
[07:48:09] <Cork> textbox dropdown?
[07:48:14] <Cork> textboxes doesn't have dropdowns
[07:48:17] <_anli> Yeah, I get one in chrome
[07:48:23] <_anli> With suggestions
[07:48:37] <ceramicskulls> cork: http://jsfiddle.net/w8kkoq2y/4/
[07:48:38] <Cork> are you talking about the form fill thing?
[07:48:48] <_anli> yeah
[07:48:48] <Cork> in that cause input should catch taht
[07:48:53] <Cork> *that
[07:49:04] <_anli> Is it possible to write an event handler for it?
[07:49:31] <_anli> Also, the box gets yellow, which is ugly :)
[07:49:55] <Cork> _anli: .on('input'
[07:50:13] <Cork> ah, no you can't change the styling
[07:50:19] <Cork> chrome overrides the color you set
[07:50:41] <_anli> But maybe I can change the state of the textbox or change it to another
[07:50:54] <Cork> no
[07:51:02] <Cork> ceramicskulls: is result meant to be an array?
[07:51:13] <Cork> or why do you create it twice?
[07:51:14] <_anli> If there is an event occuring when a selection is made, that would be a possibility
[07:51:27] <ceramicskulls> It's multiple objects coming it
[07:51:28] <Cork> no, case you can't override the color they set
[07:51:37] <Cork> ceramicskulls: as separate ajax calls you mean?
[07:51:46] <_anli> I just want "normal" color
[07:51:55] <Cork> _anli: i understand what you want
[07:51:58] <Cork> but you can't
[07:52:00] <ceramicskulls> I'm just going to each object and appending the values atm, but I Want to be able to append the Key once to create the table header as a column
[07:52:00] <Cork> the browser won't let you
[07:52:14] <hellyeah> what does normal mean to you?
[07:52:14] <hellyeah> not gradient
[07:52:26] <_anli> The browser will not let me get an event when the user has selected from the list is my interpretation from what you said
[07:53:39] <_anli> Well, input occurs when a selection is done, so replacing the textbox with another would be possible
[07:53:46] <ceramicskulls> I'm using one ajax call to pull the json, but the json spits out multiple objects, that's where I go through each one then append
[07:59:00] <mad_hatter> hey...i have a html setup something like <li class = "dashitem"><a id = "item1" href = "#">item1</a></li> I'm trying to get the corresponding link id anytime a dashitem class is clicked and store it in a variable
[07:59:06] <mad_hatter> is there any easy way to do this in jquery?
[07:59:52] <mad_hatter> http://pastebin.com/HNksS5i7
[08:02:27] <ceramicskulls> Sorry if I'm not making much sense Cork ;(
[08:03:23] <Cork> ceramicskulls: json can't spit out multiple objects
[08:03:31] <Cork> it can contain an array of objects though
[08:04:47] <ceramicskulls> Ok well, I'm receiving multiple objects and I just want to create the Key (headers) once rather than multiple times which is what is currently happening
[08:06:17] <Gorge> Hello. I'm using jEditable and I want to edit 2 input/data and after SAVE all data with only button. It's posible?
[08:23:45] <malade_mental> http://jsfiddle.net/dma3wa48/
[08:24:00] <malade_mental> can somebody help? I want the callback of hover to be desactivated when I click
[08:25:34] <Pazician> Hello everyone. How can I make this just multiply once and not every time I resize the window? Now it never stops... https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0e3029a2114bba9ec006
[08:27:11] <Pazician> Oh, no I'm wrong, sorry. It just don't run when I go from 640 to higher width. Same goes for shrinking the width, it doesn't run on resize.
[08:30:31] <malade_mental> http://jsfiddle.net/dma3wa48/1/
[08:30:34] <malade_mental> I found a way
[08:36:11] <ceramicskulls> Cork: I fixed it up to how it's currently working, sorry, I did it wrong the first time...
[08:36:13] <ceramicskulls> http://jsfiddle.net/w8kkoq2y/7/
[08:37:20] <skiz> Is it possible to have a fade effect with mouseenter only? I have images and want it to change on mouseenter and stay there. unless they mouseenter another item.. but would like the fade in and out effect
[08:40:44] <gambl0re> anybody have the good parts javascript book?
[08:40:51] <robertmaxrees> i do
[08:41:06] <arthurvr> me too
[08:41:19] <skiz> Anyone know if this is even possible at all?
[08:41:34] <gambl0re> hello robertmatrix.....i have the pdf version and there seems to be a lot of blank pages, is it the same in the paperback version?
[08:41:38] <gambl0re> am i missing pages or something?
[08:41:48] <ceramicskulls> helloo robertmaxrees :)
[08:41:52] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re bad autocomplete.  and where are the blank pages?
[08:41:56] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskulls good morning
[08:42:05] <ceramicskulls> morning!
[08:42:11] <robertmaxrees> skiz not sure what you mean - it sounds possible, assuming i understand what you mean by "fade in"
[08:42:55] <skiz> Well I juse want to use a single mouse property as when you mouseenter an item. I am updating an image in another spot and I want it to stay.. but want it to fade out and in if they mouseenter on another item
[08:43:09] <gambl0re> like i said its throughout the book..
[08:43:09] <robertmaxrees> skiz that's totally possible.
[08:43:22] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re no clue then.  i don't have any random blank pages.
[08:43:42] <gambl0re> at the end of chapter 1.3 there is a whole blank page
[08:43:43] <ceramicskulls> Think you can help me out a bit? http://jsfiddle.net/w8kkoq2y/7/ I'm just trying to create the key once and make it readable
[08:43:46] <skiz> You have any idea how? I can't seem to get it to fade properly.
[08:43:50] <gambl0re> and then continues to chapter 2
[08:43:57] <robertmaxrees> skiz make a fiddle?
[08:44:02] <skiz> k
[08:44:42] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re i don't have a blank page there.
[08:44:51] <urgrap> voted for the jquery team!
[08:45:06] <urgrap> http://thenetawards.com/vote/team/the-jquery-team/
[08:45:18] <urgrap> can I ask a question?
[08:45:36] <urgrap> how can I join the team to build jquery better?
[08:45:45] <robertmaxrees> urgrap check out #jquery-dev
[08:45:51] <robertmaxrees> they'll point you in the right direction :)
[08:45:52] <urgrap> I looked at jquery.com but there doesn't seem to be much information
[08:46:05] <robertmaxrees> urgrap http://contribute.jquery.org/
[08:46:31] <arthurvr> urgrap: Let’s chat at #jquery-dev?
[08:46:35] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskulls i'm lost - what do you need help with?
[08:46:42] <urgrap> okay robertmaxrees
[08:49:54] <ceramicskulls> So I want to append the object key as well but only once, if you look, it gets duplicated with each object, I put an example in there of how I want the table to come out as http://jsfiddle.net/w8kkoq2y/7/
[08:52:31] <robertmaxrees> oh.  that's going to be gross.
[08:52:52] <jayjo> I need to flesh this idea out: I have an app that takes user inputs and creates a graph on the server (python backend, matplotlib). The graphs are highly involved, so I need the user to be able to make minor adjustments and see the output immediately instead of resubmitting a form, etc. I have a route that pulls images from the server based on the filename, can I have javascript load the image dynamically on
[08:52:58] <jayjo>  the same page
[08:52:58] <robertmaxrees> i see what you're trying to say - there a reason you're not using the headers in a more... traditional way, ceramicskulls?
[08:53:04] <ceramicskulls> robertmaxrees D:
[08:53:24] <ceramicskulls> Well, it just looks ugly UI perspective :D
[08:53:33] <ceramicskulls> It also breaks the page
[08:53:39] <Ice_Strike> Is there a way to get all the input names from a div?
[08:53:47] <Ice_Strike> then it will pass on for ajax
[08:53:56] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskulls i'd disagree with that first point, but OK.
[08:54:51] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike sure - $('div input').each(function() { console.log($(this).prop('name'); });
[08:54:58] <ceramicskulls> Well, if you look at the titles, I have some that come in as sentences and it just breaks the table, I rather have it come in as a column instead of a row
[08:55:10] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees Nice idea
[08:55:17] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskulls you mean as a row instead of a column ;)
[08:55:35] <ceramicskulls> lol D:
[08:55:37] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees Is it bad approach not to use the <form> and I am passing to ajax?
[08:55:43] <regedit> hello
[08:55:48] <ceramicskulls> It works fine now the way it is, I just wanted to make it look a bit nicer :(
[08:56:01] <regedit> is there a plugin/library for creating & inserting prepared snippets of text? think data-entry web app, repetitive "templates" or snippets of content
[08:56:03] <Ice_Strike> like I am using <div> instead of <form>
[08:56:13] <skiz> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/t2penowq/5/
[08:56:14] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskulls you can do that if you really want, yot just need to create the fields manually and then append to each tr.
[08:56:39] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike i prefer using form tags for fallbacks where appropriate, but you can get away without using 'em/.
[08:56:51] <ceramicskulls> oh fck
[08:56:57] <ceramicskulls> I'll just wait then lol
[08:57:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:57:18] <robertmaxrees> skiz yeah, this is basically how you do it.
[08:57:22] <robertmaxrees> skiz what are you lost about?
[08:57:32] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees I see
[08:57:35] <ceramicskulls> This is just a project I started to work on with out being told so - wanted it done before hand cause I know it's coming lol
[08:57:36] <skiz> The way I have it now the image shows up and then disapears and then fades in again.
[08:57:50] <skiz> I want the current image to fadeout and the new one to fade in
[08:58:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/t2penowq/6/ skiz
[08:58:05] <robertmaxrees> ...
[08:58:10] <robertmaxrees> just need to tell it to fadeout first :)
[08:58:11] <skiz> but don't want to use the mouseleave property cause I want the last mouseenter image to stay there
[08:59:24] <skiz> yeah I tried that.. it makes it all wonky.. the image fades in and out a couple times before it stays in place.. let me put some images in there
[09:00:33] <jayjo> Is there a way to take a form and submit it with AJAX? do I have to disable the submit button? Now even though I have the .ajax call in my index.js file it still does the default behavior of submitting the buton
[09:00:50] <robertmaxrees> jayjo you need to cancel the default submit opf the form.
[09:01:11] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[09:02:13] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: in that anon function do I do my ajax call?
[09:02:21] <robertmaxrees> jayjo yep.
[09:03:28] <skiz> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/t2penowq/9/
[09:04:46] <robertmaxrees> skiz oh yeah, you need to use the done/complete callbacks since animations are async
[09:04:52] <gambl0re> the Good Parts Javascript makes it complicated by using the rails diagram as examples. why not just use real js code examples instead...
[09:05:09] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re bedcause the rails diagrams are clearer if you... don't know javascript.
[09:05:12] <samssh> skiz, robertmaxrees Or possibly cancel the earlier animations.
[09:05:20] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: do I also have to remove the action from my form?
[09:05:22] <samssh> Not sure if you can do that.
[09:05:30] <skiz> hmm, any examples you know of on how I would go about doing this?
[09:05:33] <robertmaxrees> jayjo nope.  just cancel the submit event.
[09:05:39] <robertmaxrees> skiz http://api.jquery.com/fadein/ shows you.
[09:05:41] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:06:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/t2penowq/10/
[09:06:24] <gambl0re> i disagree...
[09:06:42] <gambl0re> you learn by looking at real code...
[09:06:44] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re he also goes pretty in-depth about how the parse works.
[09:07:00] <robertmaxrees> the rails diagrams help a great deal if you don't have any formal experience with the language.
[09:07:31] <gambl0re> i thought this book was intermediate level...
[09:07:35] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[09:07:47] <skiz> ok nice! thats what im trying to do. Thank you!
[09:07:52] <robertmaxrees> intermediate programmer level.  it also covers some pretty advanced topics, too.
[09:08:24] <gambl0re> does he the rails diagram throughout the entire book?
[09:08:28] <gambl0re> does he use
[09:08:40] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re when appropriate.  there are also lots of code examples throughout, too.
[09:09:04] <robertmaxrees> the rails diagrams are great for explaining things like parsing and regex.
[09:10:32] <jayjo> Still on hitting this submit button the normal behavior happens: https://bpaste.net/show/5624a7740b10
[09:10:47] <jayjo> is preventDefault() a function or was I supposed to write code for taht?
[09:10:53] <robertmaxrees> jayjo $('#single-underlying') is this the button?
[09:10:56] <robertmaxrees> or is that the form element?
[09:11:00] <jayjo> no, it's the form
[09:11:05] <jayjo> I see
[09:11:15] <jayjo> I should do that for the button specifically, and then serialize the form
[09:11:17] <robertmaxrees> and this code is in a doc ready/comes after the form's code?
[09:11:18] <robertmaxrees> and no.
[09:11:23] <robertmaxrees> you do it on the form specifically.
[09:11:31] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault() is how you prevent the default action of an event.
[09:11:38] <robertmaxrees> so this should work.
[09:13:56] <Gorge> Hello. I'm using jEditable and I want to edit 2 input/data and after SAVE all data with only button. It's posible?
[09:18:52] <boxatom> I need some help :) im trying to reorder the tabs of some elements,  but for selecting im doing something like $(“input select”).each( function(i)….
[09:19:44] <boxatom> but the order of i isint comming up as the order on the dom, mor of like, the order of the inputs, followed by the order of the selects… is there a way to sort it in the same order as the DOM?
[09:20:34] <bango2> input select is a css selector for select tags inside of input tags
[09:20:46] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball
[09:20:59] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  i can't see what you're talking about, bango2
[09:21:18] <boxatom> hmmm so is there a way to say $(everything) :D
[09:21:30] <robertmaxrees> boxatom wut
[09:21:51] <bango2> onload function () get all elements in dom order
[09:21:54] <robertmaxrees> i mean, sure, but depending on what you're actually trying to do, that's a bad idea.
[09:22:03] <robertmaxrees> bango2 "dom order' is ephemeral.
[09:22:37] <robertmaxrees> it'll pull in the order that it's in the markup.
[09:23:14] <boxatom> well i want inputs, selects, hyperlinks and everyting ordered by tabindex
[09:23:22] <robertmaxrees> boxatom O.o
[09:23:23] <bango2> robertaxrees, the man asked how to load elements in dom order. im giving him my suggested solution
[09:23:47] <bango2> robertmaxrees
[09:23:56] <robertmaxrees> boxatom why?
[09:24:03] <Bjerre> if a girl doesn't respond after an sms 8 hours ago and we've met twice on date. Is it a bad call or not?
[09:24:16] <boxatom> because some one in dataentry wants it that way :D
[09:24:21] <bango2> Bjerre, this is a case where a for loop comes in handy
[09:24:22] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre lol
[09:24:23] <Uhkis> lol Bjerre
[09:24:27] <Bjerre> :D
[09:24:34] <robertmaxrees> box that's a really strange thing to want.
[09:24:36] <Bjerre> it's jquery related because she works with it :o
[09:24:43] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre ;) sure.
[09:24:54] <Uhkis> Bjerre: try .find('#new-girl');
[09:25:02] <Bjerre> syntax error :(
[09:25:21] <samssh> Uhkis, That wouldn't be an ID, it'd be a class.
[09:25:27] <Bjerre> haha
[09:25:56] <bango2> Moral of the story: women are Objects like anything else. And I'm object oriented at heart
[09:26:13] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy
[09:26:14] <boxatom> the thing is, I have 12 inputs in a table (3x4) that instead of passing from left to right they want it in top to bottom
[09:26:16] <Uhkis> you're saying theyre all alike?
[09:26:26] <bango2> im saying they have the same metadata
[09:26:29] <robertmaxrees> boxatom then set the tabindex in your backend instead.
[09:26:29] <bango2> the same properties
[09:26:49] <robertmaxrees> since doing this via js is going to big a big PITA
[09:27:00] <boxatom> thats going to be troublesome….
[09:27:01] <skiz> robertmaxrees: Would you have any idea why on that example you showed me every once in awhile the image fades in and out twice? But it seems odd because it only happens sometimes and on some images.
[09:27:15] <robertmaxrees> skiz the images cvan take a second to load
[09:27:18] <Ice_Strike> Is it possible to use ajax to upload the file? For a example on a page contain a few <input type="text"> and a <input type="file"> ?
[09:27:18] <boxatom> maybee il just do something like catch the tab and transfer to
[09:27:24] <boxatom> the desired input
[09:27:39] <robertmaxrees> boxatom do this server-side - trust me :)
[09:27:40] <skiz> hmm, ok maybe thats whats happening.
[09:27:53] <bango2> yeah just gathher all relevant elements, and sort them. that would be the bottom up approach
[09:28:15] <boxatom> its asp.net clasic with lots of elements and user controls, its a mess
[09:28:39] <robertmaxrees> boxatom still better to do it there instead of trying to do it in your js.
[09:28:42] <samssh> skiz, Everytime you mousein, it tried to do the fade again. Maybe check that the image is already set to the correct one.
[09:28:43] <robertmaxrees> trust me :)
[09:29:06] <skiz> ok thanks
[09:29:20] <boxatom> i should take a blue pill :) or a red one, or both
[09:29:39] <boxatom> it would be nice twist if neo chooses both pills
[09:30:02] <bango2> and goes to a rave with the robots
[09:30:05] <boxatom> thats like using a hololens
[09:33:56] <Ice_Strike> Is it possible to use ajax to upload the file? For a example on a page contain a few <input type="text"> and a <input type="file"> ?
[09:34:35] <robertmaxrees> http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/uploading-files-ajax Ice_Strike
[09:36:31] <gambl0re> http://jsbin.com/cexejemiwu/edit?js,console,output ....why am i getting undefined - console.log(person.name.dob.city);
[09:36:55] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees thx
[09:37:16] <boxatom> thanks, goodbye :D
[09:37:23] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re because there is no person.name.dob.city
[09:37:37] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re there's a person.name, and a person.dob.city
[09:38:26] <gambl0re> oh yes...
[09:38:43] <assembledbits> Hey guys, I have a plugin that is using both hover and click events, how do I remove the handler for the click? unbind() isn't doing the trick
[09:38:48] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees That look a bit complicated for simple file upload
[09:38:52] <robertmaxrees> assembledbits .off()
[09:38:58] <Ice_Strike> I think I stick with <form>
[09:38:58] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike it needs to be complicated.
[09:39:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/yneemxou/ - gambl0re
[09:39:58] <assembledbits> robertmaxrees: off() doesn't seem to work either
[09:40:15] <robertmaxrees> assembledbits might be using a delegated listener on another element.
[09:40:52] <assembledbits> robertmaxrees: would $('#navbar .expanded *') work as a selector?
[09:41:07] <robertmaxrees> assembledbits sure, but i'd personally avoid it.
[09:41:23] <robertmaxrees> if the plugin doesn't do what you want, why use it?
[09:41:45] <assembledbits> Because I'm working on government websites, on someone elses project.. and it provides the drop-down hover functionality
[09:41:50] <assembledbits> but it also works for click events
[09:42:04] <assembledbits> but I need to disable the click because it prevents me from going to parent anchor path
[09:42:24] <robertmaxrees> sounds like the plugin doesn't do what y'all need it to do any more then... lol
[09:42:43] <robertmaxrees> either way, check out your dev tools and see if you can't find where the handler is bound.
[09:43:07] <assembledbits> Using the chrome tools, where would that be found?
[09:43:17] <assembledbits> I'm not familiar with troubleshooting JS that often
[09:43:24] <robertmaxrees> "event listeners" in the "elements" tab.
[09:43:34] <robertmaxrees> the firefox dev tools show you a little icon next to the elements.
[09:44:15] <assembledbits> Alright, I'll go punch around the code
[09:44:18] <assembledbits> thanks homie
[09:52:38] <gambl0re> is it best practice do call objects like this? --- var person = {"name": "barrack"}; var x = person; console.log(x.name);
[09:52:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:52:52] <robertmaxrees> just person.name
[09:52:58] <robertmaxrees> no need for the var x = person;
[09:54:04] <gambl0re> hmm douglas crockford says its best practice to do it like so...
[09:54:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:54:31] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you're misinterpreting something.  where are you seeing this?
[09:55:21] <gambl0re> Chapter 3 Objects- Reference "Objects are passed around by reference. They are never copied:"
[09:56:03] <robertmaxrees> that is not the point being made there.
[09:56:13] <robertmaxrees> nor does he say that anything in there is "best practice"
[09:56:46] <gambl0re> so what is he trying to say?
[09:57:07] <robertmaxrees> that objects are passed around by refence.  doing var x = stooge; doesn
[09:57:16] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't copy the "stooge" object.
[09:58:11] <gambl0re> what?
[09:58:19] <robertmaxrees> where are you lost?
[09:58:42] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0s7mx6bL/
[09:58:47] <robertmaxrees> this is the point it's making.
[09:59:25] <gambl0re> oh i see....ok
[09:59:31] <gambl0re> why didnt you put nice in quotes
[09:59:36] <gambl0re> nick
[09:59:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to.
[10:01:04] <gambl0re> so its best practice to put the object inside a variable and then call it?
[10:01:31] <gambl0re> instead of just calling on the object name directly?
[10:04:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:04:05] <robertmaxrees> he never says that.
[10:04:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand where you're getting this idea.
[10:06:46] <robertmaxrees> var stooge = { name: 'larry' };  console.log(stooge.name);
[10:13:20] <TeddyMurray> just made a simple mmorpg in jquery :D
[10:13:26] <TeddyMurray> and nodejs
[10:23:27] <TeddyMurray> waiting for someone to say: "impossible"
[10:23:29] <nikhil_> nice TeddyMurray
[10:23:37] <TeddyMurray> lol
[10:23:39] <TeddyMurray> thanks
[10:23:42] <robertmaxrees> TeddyMurray not impossible at all.
[10:27:16] <TeddyMurray> getting a bug out, then i will put up a demo :) jquery ftw
[10:27:49] <hispann> jQuery rocks
[10:28:01] <hispann> I'm just getting into web development for a few months
[10:28:13] <hispann> what's the best hardware to do web development?
[10:28:16] <hispann> where are you guys on?
[10:28:36] <TeddyMurray> im using windows and chrome
[10:28:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm on a work-supplied machine right now.
[10:28:46] <robertmaxrees> anything that's fast enough to run whatever you're using.
[10:30:40] <arthurvr> I’m on mac for like 90% of what I’m doing. Linux for the rest. But, don’t care and instead spend time building things :)
[10:30:48] <robertmaxrees> ^ boom
[10:30:49] <hispann> okay
[10:30:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm on windows with FF.
[10:31:21] <hispann> I think I'll go download a linux VM though. I'm on windows :(
[10:31:26] <robertmaxrees> so am i :)
[10:31:29] <robertmaxrees> windows is fine.
[10:31:36] <arthurvr> The fact that you’re on windows might be less painful than running a VM.
[10:31:52] <robertmaxrees> ^ at this point the OS matters less than you'd think.
[10:32:20] <hispann> then why are all cool kids on mac?
[10:32:34] <robertmaxrees> some of them are.
[10:32:37] <robertmaxrees> not all of them.
[10:32:39] <arthurvr> you probably just offended many ppl in the channel lolz
[10:32:43] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:32:43] <arthurvr> what robert said
[10:32:47] <arthurvr> it doesn’t matter :p
[10:32:51] <robertmaxrees> ^ this all day.
[10:32:54] <robertmaxrees> use whatever works best for you.
[10:33:01] <arthurvr> exactly
[10:34:56] <arthurvr> if you’re doing back-endy stuff you might be better off on unix but for now don’t care and build things :p
[10:35:10] <hispann> understood
[10:35:13] <hispann> thx
[10:35:40] <ceramicskulls> hey!
[10:35:42] <ceramicskulls> I bootcamp
[10:35:48] <ceramicskulls> :D
[10:37:06] <ceramicskulls> also mac is just as good for development and what makes it better imo is the UX, the multitasking is far superior than windows
[10:37:19] <robertmaxrees> i personally disagree with that statement :)
[10:37:33] <robertmaxrees> and that's what makes it fantastic - you can get a toolset that works best for you.
[10:37:59] <arthurvr> I do personally agree with that statement but that’s just a personal opinion (just like 99% of the platform vs windows discussions).
[10:38:09] <robertmaxrees> eeexactly.
[10:38:21] <ceramicskulls> that's why I said imo ;)
[10:38:37] <arthurvr> yep
[10:39:07] <serezz> 'llo
[10:39:13] <ceramicskulls> I have a friend who is C developer and I'm his only mac friend, makes me feel special lol
[10:39:28] <hispann> serezz: hey
[10:39:38] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer qualifying the statement with "for me", instead of IMO - makes it clearer that i'm not making a blanket statement that i think one platform is necessarily superior for everybody.
[10:40:42] <serezz> I'm just getting into testing code
[10:40:54] <serezz> trying to force myself to do tdd
[10:41:14] <serezz> getting to try out some frameworks and other kinds of tech
[10:42:10] <serezz> I just wanted to know what the advantages are of selenium over phantomjs?
[10:42:21] <arthurvr> mainly because the current version of phantom’s webkit is really old
[10:42:22] <robertmaxrees> phantom and selenium do two very different things.
[10:42:44] <robertmaxrees> phantom is a headless browser.  selenium does automated user testing.
[10:43:14] <arthurvr> if you’re comparing them for testing it makes sense for it to be on selenium-powered things as your end users are using the same browser.
[10:43:52] <arthurvr> but phantom is easier to automate (if we’re just talking about unit tests at least) and can run pretty much everywhere
[10:44:09] <arthurvr> if you want to have selenium-powered testing in CI, for example, you need something like sauce labs
[10:44:17] <serezz> oh that way
[10:44:22] <serezz> yeah true thing
[10:44:43] <serezz> robertmaxrees: I was talking about running unit tests on phantom or on selenium
[10:45:43] <robertmaxrees> frontend tests?  selenium gives you options for more browsers and greater flexibility.
[10:45:51] <robertmaxrees> higher spin-up cost, but a big payoff imo.
[10:46:22] <arthurvr> I always make sure to have one or the other on my local setup and just make sure CI is setup to test all the things
[10:46:43] <arthurvr> getting to love intern to take care of all the things for me
[10:46:54] <arthurvr> http://theintern.github.io/ it rocks
[10:48:10] <hispann> intern seems interesting
[10:48:15] <hispann> I will also check it out one day
[10:48:45] <serezz> I know intern just never tried it
[10:48:52] <serezz> I should, one day
[11:00:17] <hispann> is it really so much cooler?
[11:00:21] <arthurvr> yeah it’s cool
[11:10:42] <TeddyMurray> robertmaxrees, can i PM you the link to the jquery game? i dont want to overload the server... no idea how many connections it can handle
[11:11:05] <Uhkis> didn't you say it's mmorpg?
[11:11:48] <TeddyMurray> morpg i should've said
[11:11:56] <amirite> i is troll
[11:12:13] <Uhkis> :)
[11:12:42] <robertmaxrees> i can't really look at it now sooo...
[11:12:58] <amirite> @ajpiano your hair is too curly and red, i don't like it
[11:14:07] <TeddyMurray> np
[11:23:18] <skiz> Is there a simple way to preload images? So that when I mouseover an item sometimes it doesn't flicker
[11:23:38] <jayjo> I just put this into my html, and the button is id='submit', but this still does default button action when I hit it: https://bpaste.net/show/2ba39d678277
[11:23:53] <robertmaxrees> $('#submit').on('submit', function(e) {
[11:24:02] <robertmaxrees> that should select the form.
[11:24:12] <robertmaxrees> the submit event emits from the form, not the button.
[11:24:49] <jayjo> that's what I had, I just switched it back... but I can't get that console.log() to print to the console
[11:24:53] <jayjo> to even show that it's working
[11:24:57] <robertmaxrees> then you're doing something wrtong.
[11:25:01] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[11:26:32] <amirite> @binarykitten you've been here too long
[11:26:42] <amirite> don't you think 10 years is too long to hang out in a channel
[11:27:00] <skiz> robertmaxrees: It seems that when doing that fade ya helped me with earlier the images keep blinking for the first time you mouseover. I need a way to preload those images. So they stop blinking on mouseover. do you know of a good solution for that?
[11:27:18] <BinaryKitten> Nour really Amandil
[11:27:34] <BinaryKitten> *amirite
[11:27:34] <robertmaxrees> skiz https://perishablepress.com/3-ways-preload-images-css-javascript-ajax/
[11:27:44] <robertmaxrees> skiz lots of articles about it.
[11:28:15] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: i put the exact scripts and html in a fiddle and the box works now... is there a way i can test if jquery loaded on my page? Do I have to put it in a docready if it's just in a script tag on the page?
[11:28:30] <robertmaxrees> jayjo is the code before or after your form?
[11:28:37] <jayjo> before
[11:28:41] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[11:28:41] <skiz> I read some. They all just seemed a little excessive for what I need to do. To preload an image can I just create some img tags on the site and display:none them? Is that all that is really needed  to preload something?
[11:28:41] <jayjo> the script is before
[11:28:43] <jayjo> OK
[11:28:48] <robertmaxrees> it needs to be after or in a document ready.,
[11:29:34] <robertmaxrees> skiz some browsers might not actally load the images iirc.
[11:33:28] <garethdaine> Is there an easy way to detect if a subit button has been clicked that returns true or false?
[11:33:34] <garethdaine> *submit
[11:33:43] <robertmaxrees> wut
[11:34:00] <robertmaxrees> you can detect if a submit button has been clicked.
[11:34:10] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the true/false has to do with anything.
[11:34:57] <garethdaine> Well, just want to know if you can do something like if ($(‘element’).clicked()) { // stuff }
[11:35:06] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[11:35:11] <robertmaxrees> you use an event listener...
[11:35:37] <robertmaxrees> you're inverting your logic :) you do $('element').on('click', function() {});
[11:38:11] <garethdaine> No I’m not mate, I need to know if a submit button has been clicked in order not to run specific code, http://kopy.io/jIakl so I need to do if (formHasChanged && ! $(‘element’).clicked()) for example
[11:38:36] <robertmaxrees> so what you're asking is if the button had ever been clicked.
[11:38:38] <skiz> robertmaxrees: It seems even if i preload the images sometimes they blink a few times on the mouseover when they first load.... Is there any way to avoid this?
[11:38:46] <robertmaxrees> skiz not following.
[11:38:48] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[11:39:09] <amirite> BinaryKitten you were here 10 years ago fo real
[11:39:13] <amirite> i remember
[11:39:22] <robertmaxrees> garethdaine you'd need to add a class or data attribute of some kind to the form or button.
[11:39:23] <amirite> i was impressed that a female coder existed
[11:39:26] <BinaryKitten> probably
[11:39:40] <BinaryKitten> i've been a web dev for a long time
[11:40:02] <garethdaine> robertmaxrees, when the the click event happens, yup good call
[11:40:05] <Uhkis> lol amirite
[11:40:50] <BinaryKitten> amirite - yeah at least 6 years since i posted this http://binarykitten.com/js/11-jquery-image-preloader.html
[11:40:57] <robertmaxrees> garethdaine btw .on() is favored over .bind() these days
[11:41:08] <robertmaxrees> hah - nice.
[11:42:11] <garethdaine> ok, cheers buddy
[11:48:06] <jayjo> is there standard way to create an element if it does not exist, and update it if it does?
[11:48:29] <robertmaxrees> if ( !$('selector').length ) { /* create logic here */ }
[11:48:56] <jayjo> and then an else statement to update?
[11:49:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:49:07] <robertmaxrees> just create the element.
[11:49:11] <robertmaxrees> then work against it.
[11:49:27] <jayjo> but what if the element exists?
[11:49:37] <robertmaxrees> that's what the if check is for.
[11:50:13] <jayjo> but I want to update the element if it does exist... I'm putting an img tag if it does not exists, and if it exists I want to update its src
[11:50:17] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:50:22] <jayjo> sorry, update it if it exists
[11:50:36] <robertmaxrees> right, i'm not explaining it well :)
[11:50:56] <BillCriswell> What would you do with it if it exists vs if it didn't exist it? Append it somewhere?
[11:51:22] <jayjo> If it does not exist, append it or insert it in a specific place in the dom, if it does exist just update the src
[11:51:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bdtsrm4y/
[11:51:58] <robertmaxrees> jayjo ^
[11:52:00] <BillCriswell> man, thinking about this stuff is so weird after getting comfortable with a MVVM type situation
[11:52:36] <maddtech> if I'm running through an $.each loop, how to I keep adding the value to a specific variable?
[11:52:55] <jayjo> I see, you're saying just create it once, and then update it from that time on
[11:52:57] <jayjo> that's great, thanks
[11:53:35] <robertmaxrees> maddtech not sure i follow.
[11:53:46] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell yeah, stuff like that getting abstracted away is nice.
[11:53:56] <BillCriswell> maddtech: foo += fooCounter; ?
[11:54:08] <maddtech> Thanks BillCriswell
[11:54:20] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: It suurrreee is.
[11:59:14] <garethdaine> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the help. I ended up setting a globable variable when a submit button or input was clicked and then checking the value of that
[12:02:44] <BinaryKitten> i quite like using pure js for array summ  var total = arrayvar.reduce(function(t, v) { return t+v; });
[12:03:21] <BinaryKitten> unfortunately IE9+ thus a problem for some
[12:04:18] <robertmaxrees> es5-shim makes that a little better :)
[12:04:25] <BillCriswell> Yeah, luckily it's fewer and fewer people lately.
[12:27:08] <christech2> Not sure if this is jquery but it's used in one so I'm asking here. https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling , what does "a[href*=#]:not([href=#])"  mean?
[12:27:39] <robertmaxrees> that gets all links whose href contains #, but isn't just #
[12:27:40] <christech2> It's selecting anchor links that are not anchor links?
[12:28:06] <christech2> Oohh
[12:28:22] <christech2> So shouldn't it be href="#*"?
[12:28:31] <robertmaxrees> you can'
[12:28:34] <robertmaxrees> *can't do that ;)
[12:28:52] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[12:31:51] <christech2> robertmaxrees: thanks
[12:34:13] <robertmaxrees> fshosho
[12:50:06] <christech2> If I put my scripts just before </body>, I don't have to worry about using $(document), ready(), right?
[12:50:13] <robertmaxrees> generally.
[12:50:39] <christech2> Are there exceptional cases?
[12:50:59] <robertmaxrees> as long as your page is reasonably valid, they'll act the same.
[12:51:26] <christech2> cool
[12:57:57] <saml> how can I POST array?  POST request payload should be  foo=1&foo=2&foo=3   instead of foo[]=1&foo[]=2&foo[]=3
[12:58:13] <saml> jquery does the latter if I do $.post(url, {foo: [1, 2, 3]})
[12:59:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:59:43] <robertmaxrees> you want an array or a string?
[13:08:37] <decx> that's how it's done
[13:08:53] <decx> foo=1&foo=2&foo=3 would just mean foo = 3
[13:10:10] <christech2> Why doesn't this work? if ($(".sidebar").css("width") == "100")     My .sidebar width is 100%. But even if I add the %, nothing new happens.
[13:10:32] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('.sidebar').css('width'));
[13:10:34] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[13:11:10] <christech2> It's in px
[13:12:35] <robertmaxrees> that'll do it then.
[13:14:30] <decx> there's a weird clone() hack to get the css value and not the computed
[13:14:53] <decx> or just use the parent's width to get the percentage
[13:33:57] <VCoolio> hi, is there a difference between $('#target').load('file.html', function(){ blah }); and $('#target').load('file.html').done(function(){ blah });  ?
[13:37:06] <VCoolio> also, can I create a function in which I do multiple times load() and then myfunction().done()  ?
[13:38:30] <saml> decodeURI($.param({a:[1,2,3]}))  =>  "a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3"     is there a way to get "a=1&a=2&a=3"   instead?
[13:39:17] <saml> $.param({a:[1,2,3]}, true)
[13:39:21] <saml> that does it
[13:50:50] <VCoolio> ahh I need when(); nevermind :)
[14:54:31] <Sirisian|Work> Question regarding children. Do selectors work for it? http://jsfiddle.net/wa4czt0s/1/ That seems like it would work, but it doesn't.
[14:57:16] <Sirisian|Work> oh find('> h1 > span') that's valid.
[15:48:19] <nezZario> is there a datatables channel?  ....
[15:49:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:49:51] <robertmaxrees> i've asked them to make one, though.
[15:52:34] <nezZario> ok i'll try here -- just a shot in the dark -- it's hard to paste my code since it's over 1k lines long but the gist of the issue is I'm using jQuery.fn.dataTableExt.afnFiltering.push() to do filtering via drop-down box .. but it seems once the data enteres the callback defined there it is already stipped of columns that are hidden using aoColumnDefs initialization parameters
[15:53:31] <nezZario> so the idea is very simply i'm trying to have a column, it's hidden from user display, and outside of datatables, when the onchange event occurs it re-draws the tables and the filtering function filters based on this hidden column -- but the hidden column is hidden from filtering, too
[15:54:01] <nezZario> is this expected?  I mean I could save an entire extra copy of the data and use that for filtering vs. datatable's copy but it seems like The Wrong Way
[15:54:19] <robertmaxrees> you want to be able to filter on a hidden column?
[15:55:41] <nezZario> yeah basically, there are inventory items, and the hidden column is the inventory item's location, .. so there is a little drop down with the locations
[15:55:58] <robertmaxrees> why are you hiding it?
[15:56:29] <nezZario> i mean are you asking me that from a GUI standpoint or is there another way to "not show it" other than hiding it?
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> a gui standpoint.
[15:56:41] <robertmaxrees> you want to sort on information you're hiding.
[15:57:15] <uberjar> Hi.  I would like to insert a blob of html markup which includes text into an existing div and then measure it's height.  When I call height() after my html() call it always returns 0.  Is this a race condition ?
[15:57:21] <nezZario> yes because location will exist for example in location A or location B .. the options are "Show all", "Location A", or "Location B" -- it's very obvious to the user which location it's at, since they would've had to have selected the location
[15:57:26] <robertmaxrees> uberjar can you make a fiddle?
[15:57:32] <nezZario> the inventory will exist *
[15:57:38] <robertmaxrees> nezZario but they could see both at once.
[15:57:40] <robertmaxrees> so i'd just show it.
[15:58:14] <nezZario> honestly, it's not my call.. and I have more use cases for it as well.. this is just the simplest ...
[15:58:52] <robertmaxrees> nezZario https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/25782/how-to-sort-using-a-hidden-column-in-1-10-0
[15:58:53] <uberjar> robertmaxrees: is it an expected behavior to be able to get an accurate height() measurement on a div after having recently inserted it with html() or not ?   (just curious)
[15:58:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to search around for it.
[15:59:05] <robertmaxrees> uberjar .html() isn't an async operation.
[15:59:13] <robertmaxrees> are you appending all of that in an ajax call or something?
[15:59:39] <uberjar> robertmaxrees: no.. it's a call to html() and then the next line is a call that checks it's height()
[15:59:50] <robertmaxrees> uberjar can you make a fiddle then?
[15:59:59] <robertmaxrees> because html() isn't async last i checked.
[16:00:03] <uberjar> I think the browser hasnt' had time to render it.. ok I'll try
[16:00:19] <robertmaxrees> uberjar it's not async, so it's not a race condition.
[16:01:21] <uberjar> robertmaxrees: it could still be a race condition if the html() call returns too soon, before the browser has actually drawn it..
[16:01:40] <uberjar> I suspect if I did a setTimeout() between html() and height() it would work
[16:01:48] <uberjar> I'll try to demonstrate in a fiddle bbiab
[16:02:58] <nezZario> robertmaxrees, this isn't particularly my situation but somewhat helpful -- i'm taking it it is possible and maintanining a separate copy of the data isn't the correct way then?
[16:07:00] <robertmaxrees> nezZario i have no idea - i don't know datatables and don't have a fiddle in front of me ;)
[16:07:39] <nezZario> let me narrow it to my situation , at least
[16:10:10] <hackal> Hello. I have a simple input type text. https://guides-home-hackal.c9.io/home.html (the one in header). You can see that if you type something in background image changes to X. I need to add a function which clears input when clicking on the X image. What approach would you advice?
[16:10:28] <robertmaxrees> an event listener...?
[16:10:39] <uberjar> robertmaxrees: damn I can't reproduce it..  https://jsfiddle.net/p5Lme3yj/  (warning two alerts will fire)
[16:11:03] <uberjar> in the fiddle it alerts 0 and then 54.. but in my actual case it's 0 then 0
[16:11:08] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to warn me, whynot make them console logs...?
[16:11:31] <uberjar> didn't know if you'd have a js debugger on hand
[16:11:36] <uberjar> but I suppose that's kinda silly now that I think about it
[16:11:39] <robertmaxrees> uberjar lol
[16:11:43] <uberjar> lol
[16:11:43] <uberjar> :)
[16:11:45] <robertmaxrees> every browser has one these days.
[16:13:14] <uberjar> ok well I suppose all I wanted to know is what the expected behavior was really…   that it's supposed to always return the correct height
[16:13:29] <robertmaxrees> uberjar yes. that's supposed to work.
[16:13:31] <uberjar> I'll try a few things until I can either get it ironed out, or make a fiddle with a huge html blob to exactly reproduce it
[16:13:44] <uberjar> ok thnx
[16:15:12] <robertmaxrees> uberjar http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kahy7nft/
[16:23:24] <acidjazz> what is that madness
[16:25:09] <nezZario> it's actually the searchable thing
[16:33:04] <nezZario> here is a full fiddle of my issue, distilled to as little code as possible: https://jsfiddle.net/tudzs4j1/
[16:50:38] <acidjazz> man
[16:50:49] <acidjazz> i keep forgetting the syntax for a jquery .on handler for dynamic elements
[16:50:58] <acidjazz> $(parent).on 'children', 'click', funciton() ?
[16:52:07] <acidjazz> no
[16:52:12] <acidjazz> swap click and chidren
[17:04:31] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz .on()'s first arg is always the event.
[17:30:46] <acidjazz> i see
[17:30:59] <acidjazz> so parent.on event, dynamic children, function
[17:31:13] <robertmaxrees> it can be any children.
[17:31:16] <robertmaxrees> even status
[17:31:18] <robertmaxrees> *static
[17:31:32] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {});
[17:31:38] <acidjazz> but why seperate if its static then right
[17:31:44] <acidjazz> why not but the exact elements as the parent
[17:31:46] <acidjazz> isnt that faster
[17:31:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?\
[17:32:05] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean direct vs delegateD?
[17:32:07] <acidjazz> $(children).on 'click', function()
[17:32:09] <acidjazz> yea
[17:32:19] <robertmaxrees> not really?
[17:32:24] <robertmaxrees> nothing appreciable, at least.
[17:32:33] <acidjazz> qhat do you mean appreciable
[17:32:35] <acidjazz> what*
[17:32:40] <acidjazz> here let me link my code
[17:33:02] <robertmaxrees> there might be a small performance degredation, but it'd be so miniscule that nobody would ever notice it.
[17:33:04] <acidjazz> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7b833bf331d82f533623
[17:33:18] <acidjazz> ignore that return in handlers()
[17:33:22] <acidjazz> thats coffee
[17:33:46] <robertmaxrees> what's up with the excessively specific selectors?
[17:33:55] <acidjazz> less dom scrapeing
[17:33:58] <acidjazz> faster
[17:34:02] <robertmaxrees> that's... not how that works.
[17:34:24] <acidjazz> ?
[17:34:28] <robertmaxrees> you just need .browse .close
[17:34:35] <robertmaxrees> that's plenty specific and fast.
[17:34:38] <acidjazz> no thats slower
[17:34:42] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:34:46] <acidjazz> thatll scrape all elements inb etween
[17:34:50] <robertmaxrees> err...
[17:34:51] <acidjazz> in between*
[17:34:52] <robertmaxrees> no it won't.
[17:34:58] <robertmaxrees> the browser will optimize that for you.
[17:34:59] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[17:34:59] <acidjazz> yea ive ran tests
[17:35:10] <robertmaxrees> and what was the actual speed difference?
[17:35:15] <acidjazz> what if i make a differnt close button in between those elements
[17:35:18] <acidjazz> super minimal
[17:35:21] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[17:35:24] <robertmaxrees> code for readability.
[17:35:33] <robertmaxrees> and why would you ever put another close as a parent of close?
[17:35:41] <acidjazz> oh interesting
[17:36:01] <robertmaxrees> write code for readability first, then optimize later if you have issue.
[17:36:14] <robertmaxrees> also, your current code has absolutely no flexibility.
[17:36:17] <acidjazz> who knows some younger programmer might join in w/ his hip hop and saggy pants and break stuff w/ millemium-style ways
[17:36:34] <arc_> it's much easier to break stuff doing it this way
[17:36:36] <acidjazz> well.. id not really leave room for issues
[17:36:41] <robertmaxrees> hi i'm a millenial hope that help.
[17:37:05] <acidjazz> * i dont really want to leave room for issues in the first place
[17:37:11] <robertmaxrees> then don't do it this way ;)
[17:38:00] <acidjazz> there are a ton of elements between browse and close
[17:38:11] <acidjazz> it would make sense to make other close buttons possibly
[17:38:15] <robertmaxrees> great - just do the parent and target.
[17:38:21] <acidjazz> like a close button for the problems elements
[17:38:35] <acidjazz> also the childrens parent might be a common name used elsewehre
[17:38:47] <robertmaxrees> then your markup isn't very semantic.
[17:38:52] <acidjazz> i also find htis easier to read personally
[17:39:05] <robertmaxrees> you find it easier because you wrote it :)(
[17:39:08] <acidjazz> shows the exact element its handling
[17:39:17] <robertmaxrees> so would .browse .close ;)
[17:39:42] <acidjazz> maybe if you saw the page youd understand
[17:40:05] <robertmaxrees> i highly doubt that this would be an exception to a general rule i've been following for years.
[17:40:14] <robertmaxrees> unless the markup is busted.
[17:40:20] <acidjazz> where is this a rule
[17:40:29] <robertmaxrees> it's a general rule i've followed for years.
[17:40:56] <robertmaxrees> most people i know avoid doing selectors like you are unless the markup is really funky.
[17:41:01] <acidjazz> you know the difference in scrapeing between .this .that and > .this > .that?
[17:41:10] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:41:11] <acidjazz> there could be infinite children in between the two
[17:41:13] <robertmaxrees> and?
[17:41:18] <acidjazz> it has to scrape a bunch more
[17:41:26] <robertmaxrees> it's not scraping anything.
[17:41:52] <robertmaxrees> and unless you're seeing performance problems, it's really not a problem.
[17:42:02] <acidjazz> if i put like 10k divs in between those elements, youd see a significant difference in > vs not
[17:42:14] <robertmaxrees> sure - then your problem is bad markup.
[17:42:17] <acidjazz> so like i said.. i keep it a general rune to avoid performance problems off the bat
[17:42:22] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:42:30] <robertmaxrees> then you wind up with undreadable code.
[17:42:32] <acidjazz> and not wait for them to occur :)
[17:42:50] <robertmaxrees> you'll see that most people tend to agree with my stance.
[17:42:52] <acidjazz> well not only is it readable, but you can understand the hierarchy of my elements via my selector
[17:43:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good thing.
[17:43:07] <acidjazz> i understand how you'd think that, being that you've made it a rule
[17:43:10] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't couple things that tightly.
[17:43:19] <acidjazz> why
[17:43:25] <robertmaxrees> because you want decaoupled code.
[17:43:33] <acidjazz> to leave margin for error?
[17:43:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:43:47] <acidjazz> or performance issues
[17:43:50] <SirLagz> easier to debug when you can test individual sections of code
[17:43:51] <robertmaxrees> i never have the problems you're talking about fwiw.
[17:43:52] <arc_> so you don't have to change 10,000 things when you change one thing
[17:44:00] <robertmaxrees> except i never have to change 10,000 things.
[17:44:09] <acidjazz> performance issues stack up
[17:44:15] <arc_> i'm on your side here :p
[17:44:18] <acidjazz> and multiply by the device type
[17:44:20] <robertmaxrees> i have yet to exeperience.
[17:44:29] <robertmaxrees> *experience major performance issues like you'
[17:44:32] <robertmaxrees> *you're claiming.
[17:45:13] <acidjazz> i'm not claiming anything.. its just from experience
[17:45:17] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[17:45:18] <robertmaxrees> sure...
[17:45:25] <robertmaxrees> enjoy that.
[17:45:28] <acidjazz> lets agree to disagree
[17:45:48] <robertmaxrees> you'll find that most people agree with me i think.
[17:45:57] <acidjazz> you've made that clear :)
[17:45:59] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:46:02] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.
[17:46:03] <mdev> listen to the robert
[17:46:09] <acidjazz> i think i hit a nerve
[17:46:13] <mdev> :)
[17:46:18] <acidjazz> i remember one gig i did for adidas
[17:46:35] <acidjazz> their entire oregon team was on thinkpads running XP w/ some old IE and FF.. all locked down by their IT
[17:46:53] <acidjazz> ancient stuff, ran into all sorts of dom issues in general
[18:18:09] <compact> hey. i have alert($(this).closest('tr').find('.trailer_pallet').html());
[18:18:17] <compact> however it alwways shows "undefined" when there is something
[18:18:18] <compact> any idea
[18:23:03] <kevr> How can I bind a callback to an event that fires as soon as the value of an element changes? Using .change() and .keyup() don't take action immediately.
[18:23:16] <kevr> well, keyup does, but it's not what i need
[18:23:56] <kevr> if somebody holds backspace in the element, the events don't fire until they let go of backspace
[18:25:02] <mdev> anyone in here use dual monitors?
[18:25:09] <kevr> i do.
[18:25:29] <mdev> nice, a fellow dual monitor'r :D
[18:57:10] <se_bu5ca_ayuda> hi -NickServ-
[19:34:48] <erictheise> i am having the hardest time posting JSON using $.post()
[19:35:07] <erictheise> there is a lot of conflicting information on this, but i feel like i've tried it all.
[19:35:37] <erictheise> i get JSON from a server, then want to repost a fragment of it in a second call
[19:36:05] <erictheise> i am trying to post an array to an express server
[19:36:59] <erictheise> if i hit the server directly using curl or advanced rest client, the server does the right thing
[19:37:19] <erictheise> but otherwise, the server sees my array as a string
[19:37:51] <erictheise> i've tried setting the encoding, and JSON.stringifying, and it's not working.
[19:38:18] <erictheise> any suggestions would be much appreciated.
[19:38:54] <erictheise> i understand that v 3 has some features to make it easier, but i'm on 2.1.4
[19:57:54] <teamcoltra> How do I do an ".click" on a generated div? if I do "$('.navbar').click(function(){ alert('love'); }); It works fine, but as soon as I change the div clas to a class that gets created through an append
[19:58:05] <teamcoltra> it doesn't load the alert
[20:19:11] <monk3y> teamcoltra: attack the click to a parent element.  So $("#parentId").on("click", ".generatedClass", function(e)..). That means the parent will have the listener statically applied, and if/when a click is received by the right descendent element (with that class), it'll fire.
[20:19:18] <monk3y> s/attack/attach/
[20:19:39] <monk3y> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:39:26] <George__> I'm using jQuery.ajax() to hit a URL that has a very simple JSON object, however, I'm getting  "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8000' is therefore not allowed access."
[20:39:34] <George__> do I need to use a method to hit this end point?
[20:45:23] <teamcoltra> monk3y thanks... I found that I needed to put $(document) first
[20:49:01] <teamcoltra> Okay next (and last question... for the night) http://pastie.org/10265400 I am able to do the json stuff and get everything, but now I want to get the sky conditions but I don't know how to properly use each to get them $( result.data.METAR.sky_condition ).each(function( index, value ) { console.log(value); } gives me an object but I am not quite sure how to just get it go
[20:51:04] <Shebbi> teamcoltra: looks like an object to me.
[20:57:25] <printForever> Hi  guys
[20:57:44] <printForever> looking for some assistance
[20:57:59] <teamcoltra> Shebbi okay so I am a massive n00b here... I know I can do JSON.stringify(value) but that just gives me {"@attributes":{"sky_cover":"FEW","cloud_base_ft_agl":"5000"}} how do I get just sky cover?
[20:58:42] <printForever> so I have this 2 step process. 1st step - fill in the FORM, click submit. 2nd step - shown a thank you block. its all inside 1 div
[20:58:59] <teamcoltra> value.attributes.sky_cover doesn't seem to work
[20:58:59] <printForever> I was doing it via show/hide inner div containers that hold step 1 and 2
[20:59:56] <printForever> problem with the form is that it cant be submitted regularly because, when you submit a form, you reload the page
[21:00:15] <printForever> so I used .ajax for submitting the form
[21:00:23] <printForever> however I'm getting Cross site error
[21:00:44] <Shebbi> teamcoltra: you're almost there. Use stringify then search string for "sky_cover"
[21:01:20] <printForever> is there some other way I can submit the form, without AJAX and without reloading the page?
[21:02:37] <Shebbi> printForever: Probably. But it will require some other third party plugin/code/library
[21:03:53] <printForever> anyone?
[21:04:45] <printForever> Shebbi: ?
[21:06:39] <printForever> guys... its not really that hard
[21:06:53] <printForever> is there some other way I can submit the form, without AJAX and without reloading the page?.
[21:07:34] <teamcoltra> Shebbi is it possible for me to $.each attribute
[21:07:45] <teamcoltra> err @attributes
[21:11:38] <printForever> is there some other way I can submit the form, without AJAX and without reloading the page?
[21:12:16] <Robdgreat> http://i.imgur.com/96t6I9m.gif
[21:13:07] <Robdgreat> printForever: that's about it for your options.
[21:13:32] <printForever> ok, so here me out
[21:13:37] <printForever> Robdgreat: I had an idea...
[21:14:02] <printForever> when FORM submits I will preventDefault
[21:14:16] <printForever> but, inside the function, I will submit it
[21:14:43] <Robdgreat> you realize the preventDefault will stop it from submitting, right?
[21:15:00] <printForever> yes
[21:15:02] <Robdgreat> and then the submit in the function will reload the page
[21:15:09] <printForever> ah crap
[21:15:09] <Robdgreat> which you don't want
[21:15:10] <printForever> :D
[21:15:19] <printForever> I was thinking outside the box
[21:15:37] <Robdgreat> yeah, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but form submit reload the page
[21:15:46] <printForever> the thing is, the AJAX is actually posting the email to the server
[21:15:46] <Robdgreat> the only thing I can maybe think of is submitting to an iframe
[21:16:00] <printForever> the form is being submitted, but I get an error in cConsole
[21:16:19] <printForever> yeah... I thought about the iframe, but, I wont go there
[21:16:25] <Robdgreat> then I got nothing
[21:16:32] <printForever> but... how do you explain
[21:16:36] <printForever> the form being submited
[21:16:42] <printForever> but Console reports an error
[21:16:42] <ANJ7> Hey guys o/ need some help
[21:17:20] <Robdgreat> ANJ7: once you ask a question someone will be able to either help you or not
[21:17:32] <ANJ7> the transition isn't working smoothly here testingss.tk/test.php
[21:17:35] <Robdgreat> printForever: so the server is receiving the form submission?
[21:17:44] <printForever> Robdgreat: yeah... it is
[21:17:54] <Robdgreat> then what's the problem?
[21:18:10] <printForever> the Console? :/
[21:18:36] <ANJ7> Robdgreat: what is the problem there?
[21:18:52] <printForever> ANJ7: you have to take this page down, someone will get a seizure
[21:19:12] <Robdgreat> I was wary of clicking it.
[21:19:21] <Robdgreat> seems my concern was justified
[21:20:22] <ANJ7> what seizure?
[21:20:44] <ANJ7> there's nothing except a carousel.
[21:21:00] <ANJ7> which I made with Jquery.
[21:21:17] <ANJ7> jQuery*
[21:22:14] <ANJ7> ok, so. What should I do now?
[21:23:08] <ANJ7> no help??
[21:23:53] <Robdgreat> I don't see anything
[21:23:59] <Robdgreat> so probably not
[21:24:20] <ANJ7> ok, did you see the page ?
[21:24:21] <Robdgreat> all I see in the middle portion of the page is Hello
[21:24:35] <ANJ7> down there's a next click that.
[21:25:33] <ANJ7> Robdgreat: the fadeIn and fadeOut are laggy
[21:26:08] <ANJ7> Robdgreat: and the transition of first slide isn't working.
[21:27:20] <ANJ7> if I'm not clear to you. Let me know.
[21:27:36] <Robdgreat> yeah, I'm not sure. I don't know if I've ever used transitions like that
[21:28:04] <ANJ7> Robdgreat: ok, do you want the code?
[21:28:21] <Robdgreat> I see it. I'm afraid I won't be much help here
[21:28:43] <Robdgreat> I'm multitasking and only really able to field very superficial questions atm
[21:28:48] <ANJ7> http://paste.ubuntu.com/11797093/
[21:29:12] <ANJ7> next is the $('arrow-next')
[21:29:53] <kevr> is there a way to override a css attribute in the DOM instead of inline style?
[21:30:44] <ANJ7> Robdgreat: you there?
[21:30:53] <Robdgreat> yes. I hope someone can help you
[21:31:16] <ANJ7> Robdgreat: or can you tell me how can I slide image to right.
[22:04:27] <ycon_> In the same fiddle, I'm trying to use jQuery to hide the element when I click away. First time here so not sure. http://jsfiddle.net/ajtevxaj/32/
[22:05:58] <Abhijit> ycon_, what are you hiding and where?
[22:07:22] <ycon_> The search bar in the fiddle. When the icon is clicked, it appears. I want it to disapear if elsewhere is clicked. Can jquery do this or will it have to be css?
[22:08:51] <Abhijit> ycon_, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5337828/hide-a-div-when-it-loses-focus-blur
[22:10:30] <ycon_> Ah yes I attempted this- maybe I wrote it wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/ajtevxaj/33/
[22:27:28] <ANJ7> Robdgreat: are you there?
[22:47:36] <pokergod> I am writing an admin panel and I have 200 images listed locally, but I want to make sure that they are on the remote hosts.  I want to create a loop and check for each image, looking for 404 errors
[23:12:13] <compact> hey. i have alert($(this).closest('tr').find('.trailer_pallet').html());
[23:12:15] <compact> however it alwways shows "undefined" when there is something
[23:12:16] <compact> any idea
[23:19:10] <Cork> compact: never ever use alert for debugging
[23:19:17] <Cork> compact: use console.log
[23:20:12] <Woet> compact: www.jsfiddle.net
[23:21:56] <Cork> compact: and by that i mean, retry with console.log and you will most likely get a more understandable result
[23:33:22] <janny> Hi, If my form has a element which doesnt have the class valid...I don't want to submit the form.  However in the code below the alert is shown many times( due to number of elements in the form) how do I show the alert only once?
[23:33:26] <janny> http://jsfiddle.net/dn6pz5cw/
[23:34:25] <Cork> janny: if($(this).find(':input').not('.valid').length > 0) {  }
[23:35:39] <janny> Cork: Thanks :)

[23:37:31] <Cork> hellyeah: the link will abort the js code
[23:37:51] <Cork> it will redirect the page to Queriable.aspx?ID=http://www.kvirc.net/ instead
[23:38:53] <hellyeah> ops

[23:43:01] <Cork> hellyeah: you binding events on a link
[23:43:13] <Cork> the link will redirect the page if you don't cancel the action
[23:43:24] <Cork> and that is why you don't get the dialog
[23:43:35] <hellyeah> queriable.aspx
[23:45:34] <hellyeah> Cork:  what about this http://jsfiddle.net/u5zrmLr6/3/ still dont get dialog but this is what you told me?
[23:45:59] <Cork> uh... again, what did you change?
[23:46:09] <Cork> i don't see any difference between any of those
