[01:49:12] <robert_c> Hi guys. I am inexperienced in jquery and javascript. I have a couple lines of code written in jquery I need to understand. Can somebody help me understand them??
[01:49:31] <robert_c> They are here: http://pastie.org/private/vasvjhuyo8cnvfhcpudw
[03:06:15] <sacho> robert_c, what do you want to know about them
[04:35:28] <hollusion> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxstop/ "As of jQuery 1.8, the .ajaxStop() method should only be attached to document." Then what is the right way now?
[04:36:44] <arthurvr> what do you mean? That sentence explains what’s the right way now, isn’t it?
[04:39:07] <hollusion> arthurvr: i dont know what happened but somehow my brain interpreted that sentence as "should not be attached"
[04:40:13] <hollusion> ill show myself the door
[04:41:27] <arthurvr> hollusion: :-)
[05:01:23] <Meir`> i'm adding checkboxes dynamically to a page with jquery, and i need to submit the checked ones to a new php page.
[05:02:24] <Meir`> i already have a function that maps the selector $("input:checkbox:checked") into an array, and i managed to send this array by ajax
[05:03:32] <Meir`> but i'm wondering what's the best approach to send it to an external page (with POST or GET, POST preferred)
[05:04:04] <Meir`> thought of wrapping it as dummy input inside a dummy form
[05:24:35] <maxhoffman_> Hey guys! I'm trying to make cross-domain ajax call for the first time in my life) I'm trying to call json from another domain on localhost. And have the error on cosole: Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/html
[05:25:00] <maxhoffman_> $.ajax({
[05:25:00] <maxhoffman_>       url: this.props.url,
[05:25:00] <maxhoffman_>       dataType: 'jsonp',
[05:25:00] <maxhoffman_>       crossDomain: true,
[05:25:00] <maxhoffman_>       success: function(data) {
[05:25:00] <maxhoffman_>         this.setState({data: data});
[05:25:00] <maxhoffman_>       }.bind(this),
[05:25:01] <maxhoffman_>       error: function(xhr, status, err) {
[05:25:02] <maxhoffman_>         console.error(this.props.url, status, err.toString());
[05:25:02] <maxhoffman_>       }.bind(this)
[05:25:03] <maxhoffman_>     });
[05:25:03] <maxhoffman_>   },
[05:25:34] <wiggl3> maxhoffman_: Please read http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ before you go any further
[05:25:59] <arthurvr> maxhoffman_: that’s because your server-side isn’t setup right. Also, never paste that much code in the channel but build reduced testcases.
[05:26:16] <maxhoffman_> sorry guys
[05:26:42] <arthurvr> maxhoffman_: what’s the value of this.props.url?
[05:26:44] <maxhoffman_> so, whitout server changes i can't get this file?
[05:26:57] <maxhoffman_> link to json
[05:27:20] <arthurvr> well but your server sends it with text/html MIME.
[05:27:31] <arthurvr> so that’s a problem, browsers don’t like that
[05:28:53] <sc_> maxhoffman_: nice flood
[05:30:25] <Meir`> wiggl3, arthurvr, can you please help with my above question?
[05:31:14] <arthurvr> Meir`: reduced testcase and I’ll do my best
[05:31:35] <maxhoffman_> arthurvr i can't whrite mime type on ajax method on text/html, it doesn't help me?
[05:32:08] <arthurvr> Meir`: but creating a form element and clone/move all stuff in, then submit is reasonable.
[05:32:33] <arthurvr> Meir`: or just loop over them all, json.stringify, and send $.post
[05:32:48] <Meir`> $.post can't open a new page
[05:33:09] <Meir`> let's assumt i assign target of _blank to new created form
[05:33:37] <arthurvr> Meir`: does it have to send you to the page too?
[05:33:43] <Meir`> yeah
[05:33:53] <arthurvr> Meir`: well than form element is the only way I think
[05:33:57] <Meir`> my last question was a quite reduced testcase
[05:34:22] <Meir`> ok, but what's the best approach for assigning an array to input element?
[05:34:30] <Meir`> as a comma seprated string?
[05:34:34] <arthurvr> Meir`: where do you see a reduced testcase? My ZNC missed something then?
[05:35:07] <arthurvr> Meir`: with a reduced testcase we mean some jsfiddle/jsbin kinda thing
[05:35:10] <Meir`> it's simply a $("input:checkbox:checked")  now :)
[05:35:38] <arthurvr> Meir`: so no reduced testcase. Make sure you have the way you insert checkboxes in a testcase and we can help you further
[05:35:51] <arthurvr> Meir`: http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[05:36:35] <Meir`> i appreciate your willing to help, but fortunately i don't need a coding help
[05:36:45] <Meir`> only wondering about best approach
[05:36:51] <Meir`> for assigning an array to input
[05:36:57] <arthurvr> well then, I think I answered you.
[05:37:29] <Meir`> so probably i missed the answer
[05:37:46] <arthurvr> just move everything in a form element, make sure to have right method and type for it, call submit on it
[05:38:08] <Meir`> done this, but only one thing left
[05:38:22] <Meir`> to assign the array into the jquery created input
[05:38:46] <Meir`> what's the best way to serialize?
[05:38:47] <arthurvr> what do you mean with that?
[05:39:00] <arthurvr> `api serialize @ Meir`
[05:39:27] <arthurvr> Meir`: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[05:39:27] <Meir`> i know this method, but isn't it referred only to ajax requests?
[05:39:48] <arthurvr> it just creates a string. You can do with that what you want.
[05:40:29] <Meir`> it concatenates several elements into a GET string
[05:40:41] <arthurvr> Meir`: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/ might be even more helpful for you
[05:40:53] <Meir`> i want to assign the array into value of <input id="ids"> or something alike
[05:41:35] <Meir`> oh, that's what i looked for probably
[05:42:09] <Meir`> but is it acceptable to assign a json string to a html input value?
[05:42:55] <arthurvr> no. but now you have it as an array, so you can manipulate and insert the data as you want
[05:43:20] <Meir`> it's a simple array atm, so perhaps comma seprated is better?
[05:43:28] <ufk> hello
[05:43:37] <arthurvr> maybe yes, Meir`
[05:43:45] <arthurvr> that’s why I suggested .serialize first
[05:43:47] <arthurvr> `api serialize
[05:44:18] <Meir`> i think i'll go for  arr.join
[05:45:40] <ufk> can anyone help me with ajax jsonp ? i return test([])  from server but i still get parse error from jquery. i have a function test available for execution
[06:18:02] <bed777> hi guys
[06:18:04] <bed777> i've a problem
[06:18:14] <arthurvr> bed777: hi
[06:18:21] <arthurvr> !ask @ bed777
[06:18:24] <bed777> when I trigger an event with $(window).trigger() it doesn't trig anything
[06:18:40] <arthurvr> hey is the b-ot broken? :-/
[06:18:47] <bed777> but if I use jQuery(window).trigger
[06:18:49] <bed777> it wowrks, any ideas?
[06:19:02] <bed777> ... arthurvr ..
[06:19:03] <arthurvr> yes. did you call jQuery.noConflict?
[06:19:09] <bed777> no
[06:19:31] <arthurvr> what other javascript is included? there must be something overwriting the $ variable
[06:19:47] <arthurvr> bed777: is the site online somewhere?
[06:20:00] <bed777> no.. I'm using a complex structure
[06:20:03] <bed777> with requirejs
[06:21:21] <arthurvr> bed777: not online? did you use requirejs correctly? be sure to check out http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html
[06:21:45] <bed777> Right now I'm using the old way
[06:21:50] <bed777> "The previous example with a concatenated require-jquery file"
[06:22:16] <bed777> If I use the new way, with jquery separated, it works only when compressed with r.js
[06:22:39] <bed777> otherwise no, i get jquery is not defined from bootstrap.min.js
[06:24:36] <arthurvr> bed777: I can’t really help you if I can’t check it out. Could be so many things going wrong
[06:24:44] <bed777> ok, thx anyway
[06:54:28] <islalobo> Hello, I'm using the colorbox plugin and having trouble getting the colorbox to close only when one of the two buttons in the form are pressed
[07:03:15] <Meir`> islalobo: any code please?
[07:07:47] <canonaneige> can I get a what what
[07:14:43] <islalobo> Meir`: the codes isn't working as it should on jsfiddle, but that gives an idea of what I have http://jsfiddle.net/mgfhvaz1/
[07:19:30] <islalobo> Where I think I want to try to do something like this: http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/faq/#faq-close
[07:19:47] <islalobo> But have the colorbox only close when a form button is clicked
[07:22:02] <Meir`> your fiddle confused me
[07:22:27] <Meir`> your wrapping a lot of divs with a very-long-named ids and classes
[07:23:00] <Meir`> u want the color box to close when a button is pressed?
[07:24:44] <islalobo> Meir`: we are displaying a form in the colorbox and want it to close only when the user has submitted the form
[07:25:14] <Meir`> please provide some working example
[07:25:29] <Meir`> perhaps you should include the plugin in the fiddle settings
[07:44:42] <islalobo> Meir`: this is sort of what I'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/BY3ZK/1/
[07:48:40] <Meir`> islalobo: how does the form send data?
[07:48:55] <Meir`> ajax? post/get to a new page? on same page?
[07:51:15] <islalobo> We are using drupal webforms. I think there is a submit handler in there. I will end up having to use ajax, I think, because this new workflow introduces a new form (in the colorbox)
[07:51:31] <islalobo> Is that related to my efforts to prevent it from closing?
[07:55:01] <Meir`> islalobo, maybe try to assign this to the "onclick" attribute of the submit button: onClick='parent.jQuery.fn.colorbox.close();
[07:56:41] <Meir`> or maybe 'jQuery.fn.colorbox.close();'
[08:00:20] <islalobo> where would I put that?
[08:04:36] <Meir`> in the submit button tag
[08:05:07] <islalobo> of the first form?
[08:12:58] <Meir`> islalobo, I saw only one form...
[08:13:06] <Meir`> and sorry but I got to go now
[09:32:04] <islalobo> I'm using jquery colobox plugin and I'm trying to determine how to prevent the colorbox from closing

[10:42:34] <robert_c> Hi guys. I am inexperienced in jquery and javascript. I have a couple lines of code written in jquery I need to understand. Can somebody help me understand them??
[10:42:41] <robert_c> They are here: http://pastie.org/private/vasvjhuyo8cnvfhcpudw
[11:09:41] <sacho> robert_c, ask a question about them
[11:10:56] <robert_c> I just do not fully understand that section. Can you briefly mention what that section does? @sacho?
[11:15:57] <sacho> it registers an onchange event handler which either changes some font-weight or sets a data property on the element
[11:18:36] <gabmus> hello there, I'm new to js and jquery, i need to use them to change a css on page scroll, but I'm stuck... I found this http://jsfiddle.net/psvn9/900/ example online; i can play around with it in jsfiddle, but when i use it in my project it just doesnt work. i guess that $(document) should be changed to my document's name, but i tried changing it with index.html and style.css with no success. anyone can hel
[11:18:42] <gabmus> p me?
[11:19:23] <arthurvr> gabmus: no, that’s not right. $(document) selects the document object (the DOM)
[11:19:55] <arthurvr> gabmus: the ready event makes sure no dom manipulation happens when the document isn’t ready building up
[11:20:31] <xec_> there's no dom ready handler in that demo?
[11:20:52] * arthurvr is like really really stupid today
[11:21:17] <arthurvr> It’s a scroll event, sorry :-)
[11:21:24] <gabmus> what can i do to make it work in my code? do i need to do import something fancy in the header? i already imported jquery 1.11.2 from google
[11:21:36] <gabmus> and the script as well
[11:21:50] <arthurvr> gabmus: sorry for probably confusing you with my previous comments :)
[11:22:14] <gabmus> no worries
[11:24:14] <gabmus> it seems like a really stupid problem, but i never used js before so i have about no idea what i'm doing
[11:27:47] <gabmus> anyone?
[11:32:12] <gabmus> whatever, i made it, thanks anyway
[12:31:45] <marchelzo_> How can I get the responseText in the success callback when I do a POST request?
[12:40:13] <Snerf> marchelzo_ , can ya pastebin what ya got?
[12:42:44] <marchelzo_> Snerf: It was kind of a stupid question. I figured it out now.
[12:43:08] <Snerf> marchelzo_, aye :)
[12:43:23] <marchelzo_> I didn't realize that the thing passed to the success callbacl _is_ the response text.
[12:43:30] <marchelzo_> s/bacl/back
[12:43:31] <Snerf> mmhmm
[12:57:13] <StanAccy> how do folks normally handle url references within jquery ajax callbacks being relative to the app context?

[14:21:56] <sacho> try using .map()
[14:55:19] <Non> hi
[15:31:07] <TheHodge> sacho: sorry I didn't respond, I sorted it with .each, thanks though :)
[17:05:27] <reynierpm> hi and good night can I get some advice on this SO topic http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28269745/find-key-in-javascript-object-and-get-values-for-each-one ??

[23:50:22] <Beaky> Hello all. I know I can do something like this: $(this).animate()
[23:50:35] <Primero> thanks Woet
[23:50:42] <Beaky> But how do I use a variable containing the ID I am targeting rather than using this?
[23:51:15] <Woet> Beaky: have you read the jQuery docs?
[23:51:18] <Beaky> Like $(var).animate(); I have tried square brackets already. Thank you.
[23:51:38] <Woet> Beaky: http://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
[23:53:24] <Beaky> Thanks Woet. There doesn't seem to be the answer on that page. I'm not sure where to go on the docs to find this out.
[23:53:41] <Beaky> I don't want to use my own ID instead of this. I want to use a variable that contains the ID name.
[23:53:43] <Woet> Beaky: where is the # in your code?
[23:53:53] <Woet> is your var prepended with #?
[23:54:03] <Beaky> Yes.
[23:54:18] <Woet> reproduce your issue at www.jsfiddle.net
[23:54:21] <Woet> or provide a link to your site.
[23:55:05] <Beaky> Well I wouldn't know how to reproduce the issue because I don't know what syntax I need to use to include a variable in the animate line.
[23:55:30] <emocakes> hello?
