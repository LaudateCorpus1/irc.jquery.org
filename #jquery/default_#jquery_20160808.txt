[00:46:20] <mike97306> hello all
[00:46:36] <mike97306> I've got a question :=)
[00:48:40] <mike97306> how can I get two values from one select option and put into two input boxes next to the select list
[00:48:51] <mike97306> then total the list of values
[00:51:27] <mike97306> anyone here?
[01:09:10] <mike97306> how can I get two values from one select option and put into two input boxes next to the select list
[01:09:12] <mike97306> then total the list of values
[01:29:34] <Yepp> I know keypress is somewhere between keydown and up. What I need tho is keyup and keypress in one. Keypress on first press of a key in my console log says input is empty. Keyup says it has.
[01:29:36] <Yepp> But
[01:29:47] <Yepp> keyup checks all kinds of keys
[01:58:40] <Cork> Yepp: never ever use keypress, it is a legacy none cross browser event
[01:59:05] <Cork> Yepp: if you only care about use input use the "input" event
[01:59:27] <Cork> Yepp: if you want special keys like enter, tab and so on use keydown
[01:59:48] <Yepp> i somehow managed how to make keydown not to check the value instantly with settimeout
[01:59:58] <Yepp> there's still a problem tho
[02:00:31] <Yepp> with keyup, everything is fine, except that. If tab was pressed, the next input is validated right away
[02:00:37] <Yepp> with keydown it is not
[02:00:38] <Yepp> but
[02:01:02] <Cork> and you really can't use the input event?
[02:01:08] <Yepp> if I emptied the input with backspace. it doesn't catch it
[02:01:09] <Cork> it should be your default choice
[02:01:11] <Yepp> tried it
[02:01:27] <Cork> and?
[02:01:51] <Yepp> upon emptying the input, the validation is still kinda there. Disabled submit
[02:02:06] <Yepp> cause unlike the keyup, it'll detect that I emptied the input
[02:02:07] <Cork> could you make a jsfiddle?
[02:02:24] <Yepp> I'll try to make the simplest fiddle
[02:02:35] <Cork> (cause it sounds like you only tried keyup and keydown)
[02:02:47] <Cork> cause the input event shouldn't have that problem
[02:03:26] <Yepp> so you mean, supposed to be, input can detect backspace too?
[02:03:38] <Cork> it detects changes to the input field
[02:03:57] <Cork> paste removal of content
[02:04:17] <Cork> it doesn't detect keypresses that doesn't visibly change the content of the field
[02:04:31] <Cork> like enter, or ctrl, alt and so on
[02:04:58] <Cork> it should be prefect for validation tests
[02:05:24] <arc_> i thought input doesn't fire until blur
[02:05:33] <Cork> that's change
[02:05:44] <arc_> oh right
[02:05:47] <arc_> sorry, long day :p
[02:08:17] <arc_> why is 'textinput' not on mdn
[02:09:43] <Cork> cause it's only called input
[02:09:55] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input
[02:10:04] <Cork> and for the event https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[02:10:11] <arc_> i see references to textinput as a separate event from input
[02:10:20] <Cork> not as a standard event
[02:10:55] <arc_> so where did it come from, how can i read about it
[02:11:45] <Cork> donno what browser has it, cause i can't say i've seen it
[02:12:16] <Yepp> hang on a little more
[02:12:28] <arc_> The textInput event, originally proposed as a replacement for keypress, was removed in favor of the current beforeinput and input events.
[02:12:41] <arc_> https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-textinput
[02:13:33] <Cork> ok, so it never got further then spec proposition
[02:13:59] <Cork> arc_: have a look in the dom git repo / there mailing archive
[02:14:47] <arc_> it's all right, if it's not something to be used, i don't really care about it :)
[02:14:48] <arc_> thanks though
[02:15:07] <Cork> i don't think a single browser has it implemented so...
[02:15:29] <arc_> i think this is where i initially saw it http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7105997/javascript-change-event-on-input-element-fires-on-only-losing-focus
[02:15:38] <arc_> from 2011
[02:16:24] <Cork> ya, be careful about so, lots and lots of answers there sucks, and are straight out wrong
[02:16:50] <arc_> ya
[02:16:53] <Cork> never use it for more then hints on what to look up
[02:18:21] <Yepp> cant reproduce it in jsfiddle -.-
[02:18:32] <Yepp> ugh
[02:18:43] <Yepp> for some reason the lib is not being read
[02:18:52] <Cork> Yepp: sounds like the source of the problem might be other event listeners in your page
[02:19:11] <Yepp> nope. i'll just finish this fiddle and you'll see
[02:19:15] <Cork> Yepp: it needs to be served over https and use a correct mimetype
[02:19:22] <Cork> so linking to github normally doesn't work
[02:20:21] <Cork> and ya, link what you have as long as it represents what should be needed
[02:20:34] <Cork> we can fix up the rest
[02:24:07] <Yepp> does the fiddle uses html5 btw?
[02:24:19] <Yepp> I needed the required attribute to make it to work in fiddle
[02:24:19] <Cork> html5 is marketing so no
[02:24:24] <Cork> it uses html
[02:24:28] <Yepp> well that's explains it
[02:24:29] <Cork> "the living standard"
[02:24:52] <Cork> Yepp: there are no html5 standard
[02:25:04] <Yepp> I need the required attribute. hmm I guess I'll just upload it to server and let you go there. It's on development stage anyway
[02:25:13] <Cork> ya, that is part of html
[02:25:22] <Yepp> oh there you go
[02:25:26] <Cork> and yes that works as long as the browser supports it
[02:25:30] <Cork> it doesn't depend on a version
[02:25:31] <Yepp> i imported the libs from my server instead
[02:25:32] <Yepp> lol
[02:25:34] <Yepp> it works
[02:34:07] <Yepp> there
[02:34:14] <Yepp> I finally made a working fiddle
[02:34:29] <Yepp> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/j13tg3fm/
[02:34:30] <arc_> i think you should probably link it
[02:34:33] <arc_> lol ok
[02:34:41] <Yepp> try to type in the pass field
[02:34:47] <Yepp> the button will be disabled
[02:34:56] <Yepp> now ctrl+a then backspace
[02:35:08] <Yepp> you can backspace only tho but just to make things quick lol
[02:35:14] <Yepp> btn still disabled unless tabbed.
[02:35:35] <arc_> the button is never enabled for me
[02:35:42] <arc_> also ctrl+backspace deletes whole words fyi
[02:35:53] <Yepp> wut :v
[02:36:11] <arc_> actually the button is only enabled when the field is empty. it's disabled at all other times
[02:36:13] <Yepp> ctrl+a then backspace not ctrl+backspace
[02:36:29] <Yepp> it'll be enabled when you typed in minimum of 6 char pass
[02:36:47] <arc_> i know, i'm telling you ctrl+backspace will delete the whole field. you don't have to press ctrl+a and then backspace
[02:36:49] <Yepp> and same pass obviously on confirm
[02:37:01] <arc_> oh, ok
[02:37:45] <arc_> i mean .. do you want the button to be enabled even if nothing has been entered?
[02:38:33] <Yepp> That's supposed to be in an "edit" mode
[02:38:39] <Yepp> empty pass means unchanged
[02:38:45] <Yepp> so empty input is fine
[02:38:57] <Yepp> but, from typing something to deleting it. Btn is still disabled
[02:39:15] <Yepp> unless you proceed to the next input or click anywhere. That might confuse users
[02:39:41] <arc_> so the problem is that the confirm field is not resetting its state
[02:39:46] <arc_> the first field does
[02:40:18] <arc_> if you leave the confirm field and only delete what's in the first field, it works as expected
[02:41:05] <arc_> oh.
[02:41:10] <Yepp> also
[02:41:12] <arc_> it's because you have duplicate ids
[02:41:25] <Yepp> what?
[02:41:27] <Yepp> where?
[02:41:29] <arc_> ids are meant to be unique
[02:41:43] <Yepp> where? O.o
[02:41:52] <arc_> oh sorry i actually misread it
[02:41:54] <Yepp> the first one is password, the second one is password_confirmation
[02:42:01] <Yepp> also
[02:42:12] <Yepp> assuming in my original form there's more input
[02:42:15] <arc_> well you have no event bound to #password_confirmation
[02:42:29] <Yepp> upon tabbing then landing on the password field, it'll automatically validate because of the keyup
[02:42:35] <arc_> why don't you bind to a class that includes both of those fields
[02:42:43] <Yepp> if keydown, it wont
[02:42:57] <Yepp> but keydown on emptying of input does not reset the state
[02:42:59] <Yepp> keyup does
[02:43:22] <Yepp> in short, I need something like keyup but does not detect non-character keys
[02:43:25] <arc_> if i bind the event listener to .form-control it works
[02:43:58] <Yepp> i'll try
[02:44:07] <arc_> except your logic isn't really right
[02:44:24] <Yepp> on what part is not right?
[02:44:26] <arc_> you only want the submit button to become active again if both of the fields are empty
[02:45:10] <Yepp> here's another one btw
[02:45:19] <Yepp> type a pass and confirm pass. same one
[02:45:25] <Yepp> then delete the pass
[02:45:30] <Yepp> and then delete the confirm pass
[02:45:33] <Yepp> the error retains
[02:45:40] <Yepp> I expect it to be not there anymore
[02:46:02] <Yepp> because if password is empty, confirm is not required anymore
[02:47:03] <arc_> for me it changes from "does not match" to "please fill out this field" only if i don't touch anything. but if i blur the field, the error goes away
[02:47:23] <arc_> i think that's fine
[02:47:45] <Yepp> it bothers me tho when I need to change field first
[02:47:49] <Yepp> might confuse someone
[02:48:19] <MarkTheMark> hello. i have a question. im using django rest framework for API, and i just want to render what’s inside the API such as ‘post counts number’ how do i simply render that json data to html using jquery?
[02:48:20] <arc_> then validate on submit not on keyup ;/
[02:48:53] <arc_> validating on input is confusing on the face of it
[02:49:08] <arc_> the thing is giving you feedback as you're typing
[02:49:21] <Yepp> hmm, might consider that as well
[03:33:00] <Cork> damn forgot about yepp...
[03:35:02] <Cork> (the answer if anyone else cares https://jsfiddle.net/j13tg3fm/1/ )
[03:47:54] <TimLoal> Can anyone help and experianced dev, new to plugins, but has been reading watching a lot, get his head around which plugin pattern to choose for a new plugin?
[03:48:51] <Cork> TimLoal: if the plugin is a graphical plugin i would recommend widgetfactory
[03:48:56] <TimLoal> because of fluidity there seems to be a as many approaches as developers
[03:49:08] <Cork> else just create a scope and create an object in here
[03:49:10] <Cork> *there
[03:49:25] <TimLoal> thanks
[03:49:36] <Cork> TimLoal: also, it really doesn't matter much unless you plan to make a complex plugin
[03:50:22] <TimLoal> yes i am going to look at widgets, but i like a bit of pain learning the long way
[03:50:37] <TimLoal> knowing me it will be quite complex
[03:52:24] <TimLoal> i plan to make a whole UI, but for now a treeview, which i already have in JS
[03:53:24] <TimLoal> I'm presuming that the best approach is to create a suite of widgets
[03:54:06] <TimLoal> is there a good pattern to approach a large project like this?
[03:54:38] <Cork> TimLoal: for a simple none graphical plugin i would recommend something like this https://jsfiddle.net/dju9k3jd/
[03:54:51] <Cork> opps typo
[03:54:59] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/dju9k3jd/1/
[03:55:54] <TimLoal> I'm so lost with the fluidity, but i'll get there
[03:56:15] <Cork> the use pattern for that would be $('selector').myPlugin('publicFunction', arg1, arg2)
[03:56:55] <Cork> hmm, shit forgot to forward the match...
[03:57:25] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/dju9k3jd/2/
[03:57:35] <AdamPDotty> How could you?
[03:58:28] <TimLoal> see that uses a diffrent plugin pattern and i'm lost again haha
[03:58:55] <TimLoal> i'm learning somthenthing though
[03:59:39] <Cork> TimLoal: for really really simple plugins you can just do $.fn.myFunctionName = function() {}
[03:59:43] <Cork> and be done with it
[04:00:05] <Cork> TimLoal: the pattern i linked to there is a fairly common one and the one widget factory uses
[04:00:11] <TimLoal> yea i'm happy with that
[04:00:22] <Cork> it lets you create function shared for the plugin
[04:00:33] <Cork> so no everything has to be public
[04:01:03] <Cork> there are plenty of solutions and it doesn't really matter what format you choose
[04:02:51] <TimLoal> what want is to be able to grab a div and set it up with functions and even events
[04:03:29] <TimLoal> i think i will be best getting widgets to hold my hand for now
[04:04:03] <TimLoal> thank you very mush for giving me some time!
[04:04:07] <Cork> np
[04:04:24] <TimLoal> what are you doing ?
[04:05:08] <Cork> i develop an automation solution for a hosting wholesaler
[04:05:53] <TimLoal> nice, i built something like that many years ago
[04:05:57] <Cork> so everything from css down to code adding sites starting servers and so on
[04:06:23] <TimLoal> nice
[04:06:47] <TimLoal> i presume they run a virtualised stack
[04:07:20] <Cork> well some are bare metal, but quite a bit run on qemu
[04:08:55] <TimLoal> I'm currently focusing front end, but my project is SaaS and PaaS is some ways, so virtualisation is a hot topic
[04:10:02] <TimLoal> after a period of making things more complex we will see things getting increasingly simplified
[04:10:59] <TimLoal> ok let me go dig deeper into widgets
[04:11:19] <TimLoal> what timezone you in?
[04:45:52] <boann> server -m 217.23.4.138:6667
[04:53:50] <sonu_nk> Hi here any one familer with PARSE.com ?
[05:28:38] <MarkX> with jquery when i'm trying to use a button by ID, what is the difference between "#buttonID" and '#buttonID"?
[05:29:12] <Cork> none
[05:29:20] <Cork> "" and '' is the same thing in js
[05:34:05] <MarkTheMark> simple question. im trying to render the data gotten from my API. how could i render only the ‘count’ data? https://dpaste.de/ZQH5
[05:34:12] <MarkTheMark> and this is the API http://192.241.153.25:8000/api/posts/
[05:34:39] <Cork> MarkTheMark: response.count
[05:35:11] <MarkTheMark> oh.
[05:35:14] <MarkTheMark> i was going to try that
[05:35:16] <MarkTheMark> okay
[05:35:17] <MarkTheMark> thanks :)
[05:35:19] <MarkTheMark> :P
[05:35:34] <MarkX> Cork, beauty
[05:35:46] <MarkX> one more quick question. is there any way to simplify this >         $("#boxOutput").val($("#boxOutput").val + "\n" + "Device ID: " + device.device);
[05:36:03] <Cork> you need val() not .val
[05:36:08] <Cork> and no not really
[05:36:15] <MarkX> oops
[05:36:18] <MarkX> yes you are right
[05:36:22] <MarkX> okay cool
[05:36:44] <Cork> MarkX: if you can modify the html you can add extra spans in there
[05:36:48] <Cork> it is what i would do
[05:36:59] <MarkX> yes i can modify the html
[05:37:17] <Cork> oh, wait .val... >_<
[05:37:27] <Cork> sorry thats a form field you can't add spans
[05:37:42] <Cork> so ya, what you do are the best option
[05:37:48] <MarkX> okay cool. thanks!
[05:47:28] <MarkTheMark> one more question.
[05:47:50] <MarkTheMark> is there a way i can add (append) extra text besides the data that im rendering?
[05:48:08] <MarkTheMark> say, i want to add ‘POSTS’ at the end of the data
[05:48:08] <MacroMan> How can I use the !important flag in a css function? I've tried this, but it doesn't work: $('body').css('cursor', 'wait !important');
[05:48:10] <MarkTheMark> $('.post_total_count').text(response.count)
[05:48:23] <MarkTheMark> how do i go about this..?
[05:48:42] <Cork> MacroMan: you can't use important in inline styles
[05:48:49] <MacroMan> Damn
[05:48:53] <MacroMan> Thanks anyway
[05:48:57] <Cork> MacroMan: i recommend moving the css into the stylesheet
[05:49:02] <Cork> MacroMan: and use a class instead
[05:49:07] <MacroMan> Yes, good idea
[05:49:12] <MacroMan> Ty
[05:49:26] <Cork> also i recommend avoiding !important
[05:49:30] <Cork> you rarely really need it
[05:50:04] <Cork> MarkTheMark: concut the string
[05:50:41] <MarkTheMark> huh?
[05:51:00] <Cork> response.count + 'string' + 10 + 'something'
[05:51:03] <MacroMan> Cork, Yeah, I only use it sparingly. It's just in this occasion I want to make sure the cursor is always changed.
[05:51:15] * Cork nods
[05:52:54] <MarkTheMark> cork
[05:53:03] <MarkTheMark> what goes into the ‘string’?
[05:53:06] <MarkTheMark> and what is that 10 for?
[05:53:09] <Cork> uh...
[05:53:20] <Cork> have you learn js basics?
[05:53:25] <MarkTheMark> … sorry
[05:53:27] <MarkTheMark> didn’t have time :P
[05:53:31] <Cork> sounds like you should start by learning javascript
[05:53:33] <MarkTheMark> im learning django at the moment.
[05:53:46] <MarkTheMark> im learning angualr js too...
[05:59:47] <MacroMan> MarkTheMark, Learn to walk before you try and run
[06:02:16] <AdamPDotty> learn to fall first
[06:03:31] <MarkTheMark> learn to fall?
[06:03:33] <MarkTheMark> are you kidding me right now?
[06:10:18] <Alocat> Hi. I try to set attributes to multiple objects at once with jquery. It seems not be possible. Am I making somethin wrong? -> $(obj1, obj2).attr({angle: 1, distance: 20})
[06:14:04] <Cork> Alocat: you can't merge objects with $()
[06:14:19] <Cork> you would have to use obj1.add(obj2).attr()
[06:15:54] <Alocat> Cork: thx
[06:43:27] <roshan> Hi
[06:44:21] <roshan> anyone have idea my colorbox is not working on first click ? I am using it under ajax function
[06:52:39] <hellyeah> roshan:  you should fiddle it
[06:52:53] <hellyeah> roshan:  you can do ajax with jsfiddle
[07:01:03] <Cork> Alocat: btw, don't store self created attributes without data- prefixes
[07:01:17] <Cork> it risks colliding with future spec changes
[07:04:07] <km4> Cork: you use angularjs ?
[07:04:11] <Alocat> Cork: True but my objects aren't elements. I'm just manipulating the existing object properties.
[07:04:33] <Cork> Alocat: uh, so it's xml?
[07:04:41] <Cork> km4: not regularly
[07:05:14] <km4> Cork: have problem with post data in my form, send payload not form data
[07:05:18] <Alocat> Cork: No. They are three.js-objects
[07:05:31] * Cork nods
[07:05:36] <Cork> km4: ok?
[07:21:13] <hellyeah> anyone used jquery ui datepicker and bootstrap datepicker together?
[07:28:12] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[07:28:29] <shoky> hellyeah: for the millionth time - stop spamming with useless questions :|
[07:29:02] <hellyeah> aha i am sorry shoky :D
[07:29:03] <shoky> post your testcase and ask an actual question and be patient. that's all there is to it
[07:33:20] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/m03hfqqd/15/ it is my code. Code is totally fine. Everything works fluent . I want to use feature that is implemented in jquery ui datepicker with different way. But when i add bootstrap datepicker file. Ir destroys all functionality of jquery ui datepicker. How can i solve that issue any idea?
[07:37:10] <stennowork> good day, i am using jquery to create a <span> and it should have the &times; html entity as text: i specify `text: "&times;"` in the constructor, yet it does not get escaped
[07:37:37] <stennowork> is there any reason why it doesn't get escaped and written as that little 'x' ?
[07:38:07] <stennowork> my markup now looks like <span>&times;</span
[07:38:10] <stennowork> >
[07:38:11] <Cork> stennowork: cause that is html not text
[07:38:26] <stennowork> huh?
[07:38:31] <Cork> use html: '&times;'
[07:38:34] <stennowork> aah
[07:38:35] <stennowork> !
[07:38:55] <stennowork> yep, that did it, thanks!
[07:39:03] <Cork> alternatively add the unicode character directly
[07:39:12] <stennowork> right
[07:39:13] <Cork> and you can keep using text: ''
[08:09:00] <ss942> What is the bast way to provide real time notifications on new message? Do people use setInterval function for this, and send request to server? Wouldn't it be too many for server? Is there better way?
[08:09:55] <ss942> * and send request to server? -> and send request to server every second?
[08:15:51] <FilipNortic_> ss942: if you need the time from the server i guess you could query it when you need too. otherwise you can just get a time on load and diff it with the servertime all depends on what you need it for
[08:19:54] <ss942> FilipNortic_: I'm creating private messages between users, and I want to provide notification when new message just arrived. Is there a signal like function i jQuery?
[08:20:31] <Cork> ss942: either use websocket or webrtc
[08:20:41] <Cork> no need for setInterval or setTimeout
[08:21:04] <Cork> websocket means you have to push the info over your server
[08:21:22] <Cork> while webrtc sends it direct from user to user (possibly over a bounce server)
[08:21:38] <Cork> for a chat solution i would recommend websocket
[08:21:52] <Cork> then you can just push the message out to the user when it comes in to the server
[08:22:01] <Cork> and new messages can be pushed to the server over the same socket
[08:22:21] <ss942> Cork: thank you
[08:39:34] <skokkk> hi. having some problems, VERY new to jquery. here's some code: html; http://pastebin.com/upMqzKyi  jquery: http://pastebin.com/pDjdT3er
[08:40:24] <Cork> skokkk: next time please use jsfiddle.net
[08:40:44] <skokkk> inb4 I am currently learning jquery, but I needed to do something ahead of my knowledge
[08:40:48] <skokkk> Cork: will do
[08:41:04] <Cork> also your using strings for booleans
[08:41:06] <Cork> DON'T
[08:41:36] <Cork> if("false" == true) { "hello" }
[08:41:47] <Cork> "false" is actually truthy
[08:42:29] <skokkk> uuuhm ok?
[08:42:32] <Cork> also line 15 creates a local variable with "true"
[08:42:41] <Cork> so the outer homehidden will still be "false"
[08:42:48] <skokkk> so it needs to be global?
[08:42:57] <Cork> it isn't global
[08:43:23] <Cork> also you have css in the middle of your js... not sure what you want there
[08:43:26] <Cork> (line 14)
[08:43:52] <Cork> so, create a fiddle and explain what you want to happen
[08:43:54] <skokkk> I want to hide class .homebox
[08:43:59] <Cork> i think it has to be done that way
[08:44:13] <skokkk> let's do that. creating fiddle now
[08:44:20] <Cork> cause this code is a little too confused
[08:47:09] <skokkk> https://jsfiddle.net/v65v0nx5/
[08:49:54] <skokkk> Cork: do you understand a bit better what I want to do?
[08:50:21] <Cork> trying to clean it up right now, give me a min
[08:53:30] <Cork> skokkk: is this somewhat what you're looking for? https://jsfiddle.net/v65v0nx5/1/
[08:54:25] <FilipNortic_> can't you usally use is(":visible") instead of the boolean?
[08:54:55] <Cork> you can, but there is an event better solotion i'm working on right now
[08:56:55] <Cork> skokkk: https://jsfiddle.net/v65v0nx5/3/
[08:56:59] <date> Hi! I'm struggling with Flot Jquery, i have Datestamps from a Ms SQL server in yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss format which is sent through an ajax request. Now in the javascript i'm trying to plot a graph with Flot based on the timestamps, but the graph values becomes wrong
[08:57:00] <Cork> this is the solution i would recommend
[08:57:53] <skokkk> Cork: I want to be able to add a second "home" like "about" with the other one sliding away
[08:57:57] <date> Atm i'm trying to convert the datestamp by using Date() but it seems to return the wrong value
[08:58:05] <Cork> skokkk: you can
[08:58:20] <Cork> skokkk: just add another element with a slide-out class by default
[08:58:50] * skokkk begs cork for another example
[08:59:18] <FilipNortic_> for letting css do the work?
[08:59:35] <daveomcd> how come line 4 of my code executes before line 3? And how can I make sure line 3 is completed before line 4 executes? https://gist.github.com/daveomcd/f69d5207f07d46cb06d1f2252501e610
[09:00:46] <date> here's the fiddle i'm working on https://jsfiddle.net/k06ptyzm/15/ in case anyone is able to help
[09:01:55] <Cork> date: https://jsfiddle.net/v65v0nx5/4/
[09:01:59] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[09:02:01] <Cork> skokkk: https://jsfiddle.net/v65v0nx5/4/
[09:02:37] <Cork> daveomcd: it doesn't
[09:02:46] <Cork> what makes you think it does?
[09:03:00] <skokkk> Cork: that doesnt work?
[09:03:11] <Cork> skokkk: click home and slide right
[09:03:33] <skokkk> I basically want the slide right to be a second option in menu, then home goes away and slide right's content comes
[09:03:40] <Cork> you should have two articles sliding in and out
[09:03:40] <daveomcd> Cork, if I put an alert in there, the alert executes before the li elements are moved over
[09:03:57] <Cork> daveomcd: never EVER use alert for debugging
[09:04:05] <Cork> especially when you work with events and ajax
[09:04:11] <Cork> it WILL lie to you
[09:04:15] <Cork> use console.log
[09:04:48] <FilipNortic_> Cork: you seem to have a typeError in your fiddle
[09:05:00] <AwkwardCough> the alert can break you out of focus and events and can be unreliable... and annoying if you get into a loop or something
[09:05:07] <Cork> daveomcd: the reason alert will lie is cause browsers are forced to do very dirty hacks to gets the "pause" effect that alterts makes
[09:05:26] <Cork> daveomcd: this forces the browser to refire events and things and makes things run out of order
[09:05:45] <Cork> AwkwardCough: it is much more then that
[09:05:53] <daveomcd> ahhh ok I'll keep looking into the problem then
[09:06:01] <FilipNortic_> does on not work in jQeury 2.2?
[09:06:13] <Cork> FilipNortic_: it does
[09:06:14] <AwkwardCough> Cork: ah gotcha
[09:06:21] <Cork> FilipNortic_: and the fiddle works fine here
[09:07:05] <skokkk> Cork: let me show you what I'm trying to do, this is probably a bit broken
[09:07:17] <skokkk> https://jsfiddle.net/v65v0nx5/5/
[09:07:30] <Cork> ah, you added jquery in resources
[09:07:45] <skokkk> lala and about must be hidden at start
[09:07:46] <Cork> skokkk: you should use a newer version then jquery 1.4
[09:07:48] <Cork> it is VERY old
[09:08:02] <skokkk> then if about is clicked the rest go away and only about shows
[09:08:10] <skokkk> link to latest jquery>
[09:08:21] <Cork> skokkk: https://jsfiddle.net/v65v0nx5/6/ is all the js you need
[09:08:31] <Cork> the rest can be done through the html
[09:08:44] <skokkk> :O
[09:08:45] <Cork> <p class="home-menu" data-target="homebox">Home</p> <--
[09:08:46] <skokkk> it works
[09:09:02] <Cork> ya, it works when i removed the stone age version of jquery
[09:09:26] <FilipNortic_> yeah the old fiddle loaded jquery 1.4 for me over the one that was set
[09:09:27] <Cork> you want jquery 3.1 or 1.12
[09:09:48] <Cork> FilipNortic_: ya, i have an extension that blocks requests i don't allow
[09:09:52] <Cork> so i never loaded 1.4
[09:09:57] <Cork> that is why it worked for me
[09:10:14] <Cork> but 1.4 is so old it doesn't even have delegate...
[09:10:27] <FilipNortic_> ahh he loaded it himself
[09:10:33] <skokkk> so I just need to add  data-target="homebox" to each html part?
[09:10:33] <Cork> you really shouldn't learn from that :)
[09:10:43] <Cork> skokkk: to the menu entries
[09:10:48] <skokkk> yes
[09:10:53] <Cork> and an article with the class you want to slide
[09:11:02] <Cork> the data-target should match the class name
[09:11:06] <Cork> that's it :)
[09:11:28] <FilipNortic_> using css instead of js is often much better
[09:11:33] <Cork> ya
[09:11:41] <FilipNortic_> but i'm still terrible at css
[09:11:48] <skokkk> let me try and I'll msg if problems
[09:11:56] <Cork> and using left instead of width is better for the look too
[09:16:04] <daveomcd> Cork, so I removed the alert and replaced with console.log(), but it displays nothing.  If I run the same selector in console it displays the elements though.  https://gist.github.com/daveomcd/f69d5207f07d46cb06d1f2252501e610
[09:16:47] <Cork> daveomcd: you should get a string in the console history
[09:18:57] <daveomcd> I get a blank string, is it possible that the console function is executing before the elements are appended to the ul ?
[09:19:21] <Cork> no
[09:19:26] <daveomcd> Or I thought maybe it couldn't select them after being moved but if i run the same selector in the console "post-move" then it shows up
[09:20:12] <Cork> that shouldn't be possible...
[09:20:29] <daveomcd> i am using rails turbolinks... wonder if that's messing it up somehow
[09:20:43] <Cork> append is synchronous, so js doesn't get execution back before it is done
[09:20:57] <Cork> possibly
[09:21:09] <Cork> they add a bunch of event handlers
[09:21:18] <Cork> and that might mess things up for you
[09:21:22] <daveomcd> ok I'll look into that thanks!
[09:25:00] <skokkk> Cork: can you give me link to a jquery I can use for that working one you gave me?
[09:25:17] <Cork> skokkk: http://code.jquery.com/
[09:25:32] <Cork> 1.12.4 or 3.1.0
[09:25:49] <skokkk> so not 2.4?
[09:26:24] <Cork> 2.4 has the same compatibility geographic as 3, but is eol
[09:26:40] <Cork> 1.x is the only one that supports old ie (older then 9(
[09:26:42] <Cork> *)
[09:27:08] <Cork> skokkk: so if you don't care about really old ie support you should start with what will be jquery future
[09:27:24] <Cork> not with legacy code that will break later
[09:27:41] <Cork> (i plan to jump to jq 3.1 soon too)
[09:28:23] <skokkk> uuuhg I'm doing something wrng
[09:28:30] <skokkk> going to try some things then give code
[09:29:01] <skokkk> wait, that thing is for <p - I have <div's
[09:30:32] <skokkk> Cork: how would I use it for div's?
[09:31:40] <Cork> skokkk: i replaced the divs with article, not p
[09:31:49] <Cork> the p's are what you added
[09:31:52] <Cork> didn't touch those
[09:32:02] <Cork> (well except wrap them in <nav>)
[09:32:10] <skokkk> but but
[09:32:46] <skokkk> http://pastebin.com/9pMy4bRN
[09:34:17] <skokkk> Cork: that menu doesnt work with the jquery given..
[09:34:27] <Cork> skokkk: ya, cause you've replaced p with div
[09:34:38] <Cork> just change the $('nav') line to use 'div' instead of 'p'
[09:34:41] <Cork> and it should work
[09:35:02] <skokkk> cool, let me try
[09:35:37] <Cork> skokkk: and when that's done; do you understand how this works?
[09:35:52] <Cork> cause that should be the next thing to do
[09:37:21] <skokkk> Cork: yup
[09:38:21] <FilipNortic_> http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html
[09:51:41] <hellyeah> can we think those similar $extend(smt,odt) and smt.push(...,odt)
[09:52:07] <Cork> that sentence makes little sense
[09:52:45] <hellyeah> okey
[09:52:52] <hellyeah> let me try again
[09:53:28] <hellyeah> ES& has spread operator. We can push array like that smt is an array odt is another array smt.oush(...,odt) right
[09:53:45] <Cork> ya
[09:53:58] <Cork> you could do that in es5 with .apply
[09:54:13] <hellyeah> in jquery there is $extend method for merging two or more objects (afaik array is object too) so $extend(std,odt) should work
[09:54:18] <hellyeah> is it?
[09:54:26] <Cork> no, extend won't work
[09:54:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:54:42] <Cork> extend will not merge the two arrays
[09:54:55] <Cork> it will replace the index values of the first array with the ones from the second
[09:55:02] <hellyeah> ic but $extend is for merging object right?
[09:55:33] <Cork> yes
[09:55:33] <hellyeah> like this? 1,2,3 4,5,6 -> extend = 1,4,2,5,3,6
[09:55:35] <hellyeah> ?
[09:55:45] <hellyeah> is array object?
[09:55:46] <Cork> no, that is an array
[09:56:14] <Cork> yes [1,2,3] is similar to {0:1, 1:2, 2:3}
[09:56:42] <hellyeah> so apply and ... are similar yes?
[09:57:13] <Cork> apply spreads arrays as arguments
[09:57:24] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[09:57:29] <hellyeah> hmm btw is there a jquery version for es6?
[09:57:40] <Cork> jquery isn't a language, so no
[09:58:04] <Cork> you can use jquery both in es5 and es6 AND es7
[09:58:06] <hellyeah> jquery is a lib
[09:58:21] <hellyeah> 2.1.3 is for es5 right?
[09:58:21] <Cork> es6 isn't browser compatible yet though
[09:58:26] <Cork> no
[09:58:29] <Cork> it is for js
[09:58:31] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:58:32] <Cork> it works in all of them
[09:58:37] <hellyeah> ic
[09:58:45] <Cork> es6 adds new syntax
[09:58:57] <hellyeah> for example arrow notation?
[09:59:09] <Cork> ya, and most importantly let
[09:59:18] <hellyeah> so i can use let and const in jquery
[09:59:24] <Cork> and block declaration
[09:59:29] <hellyeah> let creates a new scope i guess
[09:59:34] <Cork> you can, but it won't work in most browsers
[09:59:50] <Cork> as most browsers doesn't support es6 on the web
[09:59:51] <hellyeah> i guess it will work in chrome
[09:59:58] <Cork> not really
[10:00:04] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:00:40] <Cork> most that use es6 on the web today compile it to es5 before using it
[10:00:51] <Cork> so... it just isn't any point in it yet
[10:01:02] <Cork> give it a few years
[10:01:22] <hellyeah> transpile?
[10:01:31] <hellyeah> or babel?
[10:01:55] <Cork> donno, don't really care
[10:02:09] <hellyeah> ic
[10:02:48] <Cork> https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/
[10:03:15] <Cork> when the majority of the browsers go 100% i will start getting interested
[10:03:29] <hellyeah> understand
[10:03:43] <Cork> but currently edge 12 is at 80%...
[10:03:54] <Cork> and ie11 is at 11%!
[10:04:25] <Cork> and most compilers are at ~60%
[10:04:53] <hellyeah> 11%
[10:04:55] <hellyeah> muahaha
[10:04:59] <Cork> es6 has been the standard for browsers extensions for quite a while
[10:05:10] <Cork> but it isn't ready for the open web in a while
[10:05:21] <hellyeah> understand
[11:48:20] <zenman99> Hey, is there a way to make text display as though it's been selected for copying on page load?
[11:48:45] <stennowork> you could actually select it
[11:48:55] <stennowork> programmatically
[11:48:59] <learning2> Hello All!
[11:49:09] <learning2> Would you or anyone else be able to assist me w correcting the css or jquery script to make this page responsive? http://web-mtg.com/test/carousel.html
[11:49:17] <arc_> it sounds like that's what he's asking how to do :p
[11:49:52] <stennowork> its not exactly trivial
[11:50:03] <arc_> yeah i'm noticing that
[11:50:08] <stennowork> zenman99, you could read into Range() and Selection(), see this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/985272/selecting-text-in-an-element-akin-to-highlighting-with-your-mouse
[11:50:19] <zenman99> stennowork: thanks
[11:50:34] <stennowork> zenman99, i have just worked with it as part of a low-fi contenteditable editor i wrote
[11:51:02] <zenman99> stennowork: ok
[11:51:48] <zenman99> I was hoping to find a simple "click this button to copy text to clipboard" module, but of course Safari doesn't work with them. :P So I have to display the text to be copied.
[11:52:29] <zenman99> I figure if I display the text already highlighted, users might find it slightly easier to copy. Maybe it's not worth the effort though
[11:53:17] <stennowork> seems like a convenience thing to do, the SO post i gave to you should make it work without too much effort
[11:54:02] <zenman99> stennowork: yeah I'll check it out now
[11:56:00] <learning2> I am willing to pay for solution to my lack of responsiveness on this page. I'm not up to speed on sass, lass, jquery or any builders. I assume others are quicker than I could be to make the adjustments on this page: http://web-mtg.com/test/carousel.html
[11:56:24] <robertmaxrees> learning2 wrong place to ask for that kind of help.
[11:56:51] <robertmaxrees> learning2 head to #freelance and search google for freelancing sites to find somebody to help.
[11:57:00] <learning2> oh? new to this chat/bb. trying to find the right room. i was refered here.
[11:57:28] <robertmaxrees> this is a support channel - not a good place to hire somebody :) alternatively, you can crack open your own developer tools and figure out the problem using a profiler.
[11:57:50] <learning2> have tried that when i designed the album cover...ended up doing it myself after trying a few places. PROFILER????
[11:58:58] <arc_> profiles tab in chrome developer tools
[11:58:58] <robertmaxrees> your developer tools have a built in profiler that can show you were you're having issues.
[11:59:14] <robertmaxrees> ff's tools name the tab "Performance"
[11:59:21] <learning2> google said: The page content is 1,208 CSS pixels wide, but the viewport is only 411 CSS pixels wide. The following elements fall outside the viewport:
[11:59:36] <robertmaxrees> learning2 that's not going to cause performance problems.
[12:01:35] <learning2> i'll have to load chrome. seems that is the standard now...been 3 yrs since i made a site. learning curve is large. just made 3d animated images for other pages
[12:04:41] <learning2> is there a place where i can plug in the js and make adjustments?
[12:06:08] <robertmaxrees> other than your page?
[12:06:20] <robertmaxrees> you could always start up a local development server.
[12:06:27] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, jsfiddle is great for standalone test cases.
[12:07:42] <learning2> robertmaxrees - thanks for your feedback. i found jsfiddle but need to learn how to use. i think i'll take a stab at the "freelance search
[12:07:54] <robertmaxrees> :) good luck
[12:08:10] <learning2> thanks. bye
[12:31:58] <hellyeah> yo
[12:34:20] <robertmaxrees> wuddup
[12:36:14] <whoisaCe> hello
[12:36:17] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees: hety
[12:36:20] <hellyeah> ops hey
[12:36:36] <hellyeah> i figured out jquery datepicker and bootstrap datepicker didnt get along
[12:36:43] <arc_> gather round for another tale of hellyeah and datepicker
[12:36:46] <robertmaxrees> well i mean.
[12:36:52] <hellyeah> :D
[12:37:13] <whoisaCe> lol
[12:37:43] <hellyeah> arc_:  i am sorry for asking if you dont want to see my question just state it to me :/
[12:38:04] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah he was more making light of the fact that you're in here constantly asking for help on datepickers :)
[12:38:32] <arc_> ya i'm not complaining
[12:38:36] <hellyeah> actually i finished that project
[12:38:43] <arc_> omg congratulations
[12:38:44] <hellyeah> arc_:  i am just joking
[12:38:56] <hellyeah> arc_:  thank you
[12:40:48] <hellyeah> but my manager requested so many things from me i did all but he asked one more thing that is implemented in jquery datepicker differently. I told him it is implemented like that. He doesnt like it.  He is kinda of stupid human being. I just try to find a way to make this happen. This is really extra thing i dont have to do. I can say i am sorry this is implemented like that i dont have to waste
[12:40:54] <aftab> Hello, this function works fine when there are elements already added in the html http://paste.ubuntu.com/22706873/ but it doesn't work if I add the elements using jquery.. please let me know how to fix this? the prev() function is not working here
[12:41:13] <hellyeah> anymore. But he just wont understand
[12:41:26] <robertmaxrees> aftab [class=order] ?
[12:41:39] <robertmaxrees> aftab just use .order()
[12:41:43] <robertmaxrees> err, .order
[12:42:27] <hellyeah> arc_:  it finished like 3 months ago i am search how i can implement one extra really unnecessary thing.
[12:42:30] <robertmaxrees> aftab also: if .prev() and .next() aren't working the way you want them to, your markup likely isn't structured the way you're expecting.
[12:42:44] <whoisaCe> So I'm trying to change the attribute of a button based on the URL the user came from. I currently set it up two different ways, but didn't get the outcome I wanted, am I doing something wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/5ob34gw3/
[12:42:51] <hellyeah> where is markup?
[12:43:04] <aftab> robertmaxrees: changing it to .order still doesn't work
[12:43:21] <robertmaxrees> aftab specifically, .prev() and .next() both only look at the immediate siblings.  the selector is kind of like a filter.
[12:43:32] <robertmaxrees> so if the elements you care about aren't actually immediate siblings, those won't work.
[12:43:43] <robertmaxrees> and you still want just .order
[12:43:51] <hellyeah> whoisaCe:  where is HTML markup?
[12:44:04] <plong0> hello, I just updated my jquery-ui from 1.11 to 1.12 via bower.  I am including only a subset of features => core.js, widget.js, mouse.js, sortable.js .  I am now receiving the error:  core.js:3 Uncaught ReferenceError: define is not defined   how can I fix this?  I see in jquery-ui.js it is handling declaring the define function if it is not there, but doesn’t jquery-ui.js also automatically include ALL the components?
[12:44:13] <aftab> robertmaxrees: immediate siblings must be already rendered with html ? does it not work when the siblings are generated using jquery ?
[12:44:22] <robertmaxrees> aftab that's not what i said.
[12:44:40] <whoisaCe> hellyea, well I figured since it's just a button that's being changed, didn't think it would be important, more so, just the logic I'm using my js.
[12:44:43] <robertmaxrees> aftab :) i mean that your html very likely isn't structured the way you think it is - make a fiddle and show us :)
[12:44:45] <aftab> robertmaxrees: they are immediate siblings I am pretty sure of that
[12:44:53] <hellyeah> aftab:  do you know what sibling is in tree structure?
[12:45:04] <robertmaxrees> aftab then no idea.  without seeing a functioning fiddle, it's hard to help.
[12:45:11] <robertmaxrees> whoisaCe so what's not happening that you're expecting?
[12:45:13] <aftab> robertmaxrees: ok I will try fiddling it
[12:45:19] <aftab> thank you
[12:45:22] <arc_> why are you using [class=order] instead of .order as the selector
[12:45:25] <hellyeah> aftab:  what is sibling?
[12:45:29] <whoisaCe> I wrote it in the comments of the fiddle
[12:45:35] <robertmaxrees> arc_ i already pointed that out :)
[12:45:48] <robertmaxrees> whoisaCe what is a "slug referrer"?
[12:45:56] <whoisaCe> essentially, I want the if to happen, and else is happening when visiting from referrer url
[12:46:04] <whoisaCe> http://www.example.com/slug/
[12:46:08] <whoisaCe> indexOf("slug")
[12:46:27] <robertmaxrees> whoisaCe so what happens when you do console.log(window.location.href) right before that if?
[12:46:59] <aftab> robertmaxrees: you were right I just added a <br> in the content which was generated using jquery which is why it wasn't working, now it works
[12:47:03] <aftab> thank you so much for help
[12:47:08] <robertmaxrees> aftab definitely :)
[12:47:16] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, use just a class selecotr.
[12:47:26] <robertmaxrees> also: check out the .data() method, instead of using .attr() for data attributes.
[12:47:38] <aftab> great thank you
[12:49:15] <hellyeah> .prop() .attr() .data()
[12:49:26] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:49:27] <hellyeah> better to know all of them?
[12:49:33] <whoisaCe> Ok, robertmaxrees: thanks that actually helped a lot and explained why it hasn't been working....
[12:49:44] <robertmaxrees> whoisaCe awesome.
[12:49:50] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah they're all for different things.
[12:49:52] <whoisaCe> So it's going through some kind of google redirect... Idk why...
[12:50:02] <robertmaxrees> whoisaCe is it coming from a google search?
[12:50:47] <whoisaCe> well, i was just entering the page directly - it seems like the SEM they use is affecting it.
[12:50:57] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:51:11] <robertmaxrees> i thought you said window.location.href was undefined.
[12:51:17] <robertmaxrees> is the issue the referer?
[12:51:20] <whoisaCe> yea...
[12:51:37] <whoisaCe> It's going through some google ad redirect
[12:51:55] <robertmaxrees> so then it's when you click through from somewhere else, yeah?
[12:54:08] <whoisaCe> It's a book club, so what I'm trying to do is allow users to return to the category page from the book they entered to read about, but for some reason, when they're entering the book from the category, or any part of the site, it
[12:54:27] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you've got something else going on, then.
[12:54:29] <whoisaCe> it's going through a google ad redirect first, then the actual url they clicked on...
[12:54:45] <whoisaCe> Yea, I gotta dig more internally
[12:54:46] <robertmaxrees> do you have any extensions or anything else installed that might cause that?
[12:55:07] <whoisaCe> Probably - I'm positive they have some google ad extensions on the site
[12:55:18] <robertmaxrees> i mean in chrome.
[12:55:46] <whoisaCe> Well, I was doing this from incognito and I have no extensions on
[12:55:55] <robertmaxrees> that's.... really strange.
[12:56:12] <robertmaxrees> though fwiw you can have extensions enabled in incog..
[12:56:19] <whoisaCe> Yea, I know
[12:56:25] <robertmaxrees> sho nuff
[12:56:30] <whoisaCe> Thanks a lot!
[12:56:44] <mad_moses> hi, how can I access my attribute guests in this case? https://dpaste.de/4aDL attr() is not working
[12:57:17] <robertmaxrees> mad_moses 2 things: 1 you're not technically supposed to create your own attributes on the fly.
[12:57:36] <robertmaxrees> 2. e.target isn't a jquery object - if you open your console, you'll see there's an error.
[12:58:07] <mad_moses> robertmaxrees: I thought this is valid in html5?
[12:58:19] <robertmaxrees> with the data attributes api it is.
[12:58:44] <mad_moses> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[12:59:23] <mad_moses> robertmaxrees: 2) I don't get an error? Only for the attr function
[12:59:28] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:59:32] <arc_> mad_moses he means use data() instead of attr()
[12:59:32] <robertmaxrees> so you do get an error :)
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> and then prepend the attribute with data-
[12:59:48] <robertmaxrees> like so: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3o8rmvgs/2/
[13:00:35] <mad_moses> ahh thank you so much :)
[13:00:39] <grill> anyone have any idea why $('.myelement').on('touchstart', () => dosomething ); isn't registering on an iphone?
[13:01:07] <robertmaxrees> grill does myelement get created dynamically?
[13:01:14] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming that it's registering?
[13:01:40] <grill> robertmaxrees if i change 'touchstart' to click and test on a desktop, the functionality works as expected
[13:02:47] <grill> also, the functionality appears to work in chrome inspector in "device" mode.
[13:02:51] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:11:14] <grill> is this not a common problem?
[13:12:15] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i haven't had issues but that doesn't mean they don't exist.
[13:13:04] <robertmaxrees> what kind of element is it?
[13:13:14] <grill> a button
[13:14:21] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you use just a click event instead?
[13:18:25] <grill> sec
[13:20:03] <grill> click works in the browser. not on mobile though
[13:20:12] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:20:15] <robertmaxrees> something seems strange here.
[13:20:24] <robertmaxrees> what mobile browser are you using?
[13:20:54] <grill> i tried with both chrome and safari
[13:21:10] <robertmaxrees> and you've tried clearing cache?
[13:21:14] <grill> do iOS browsers not support es6 yet?
[13:21:55] <grill> yup
[13:22:07] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[13:22:23] <robertmaxrees> never would've thought to check that.  surprising they don't support arrow functions.
[13:22:30] <robertmaxrees> they support some other stuff though.
[13:22:36] <grill> jesus christ
[13:22:54] <robertmaxrees> could always look at babel
[13:23:03] <grill> sounds like that's the only choice
[13:23:30] <robertmaxrees> we're finally integrating it into our stack.
[13:40:03] <idioglossia> hi everyone, I am trying to mix some jquery goodness in with a project of mine and I want to be able to do something like this.$('selector').someMethod and have it be the equivalent of applying someMethod to all children of the 'this' dom element
[13:40:41] <robertmaxrees> idioglossia you mean all "selector" descendents of this?
[13:41:18] <idioglossia> this.$ = (sel) => { return $('#' + this.id).find(sel); } does not seem to work
[13:41:23] <idioglossia> robertmaxrees, correct
[13:41:37] <robertmaxrees> backbone does something very similar.
[13:41:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd see how they handle it :)
[13:41:55] <robertmaxrees> fwiw, you can always just use .find()
[13:42:17] <idioglossia> i am. it's not working
[13:42:25] <robertmaxrees> without using this.
[13:43:22] <robertmaxrees> there a particular reason you want to use that pattern?
[13:43:36] <idioglossia> it's convenient
[13:43:48] <idioglossia> I am using it in React's DidMount callback
[13:45:24] <shoky> you know you can do $(this).find(selector)   yea?
[13:45:35] <robertmaxrees> just mentioned that :)
[13:45:38] <idioglossia> ...
[13:45:40] <robertmaxrees> i've always felt like that syntax is more confusing,
[13:45:51] <robertmaxrees> either way, i'd check out backbone for inspiration.
[13:45:52] <shoky> seemed like maybe it wasn't understood
[13:46:05] <shoky> which syntax is confusing?
[13:46:10] <robertmaxrees> this.$()
[13:46:19] <shoky> ah
[13:46:42] <idioglossia> oh damn
[13:46:44] <robertmaxrees> as an implicit .find() under this.$el.  backbone does that and it's always awkward.
[13:46:51] <idioglossia> so im stupid, it does work. I was doing it wrong.
[13:47:03] <shoky> obviously .find works ;)
[13:47:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:17:56] <jquery170> hi , need  to get a li clicked on window resize
[14:18:27] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:18:38] <jquery170> hi robertmaxrees
[14:18:52] <robertmaxrees> hello.
[14:19:13] <jquery170> can you help me?
[14:19:23] <robertmaxrees> sure.  plenty of people here can.
[14:19:29] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting stuck?
[14:20:38] <jquery170> i can  post  a little code on jsfiddle
[14:20:46] <jquery170> it is very easy
[14:20:51] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[14:23:10] <jquery170> https://jsfiddle.net/8odaLc9e/     See comment on window resize event
[14:23:28] <robertmaxrees> so I'd rethink the problem :)
[14:23:43] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to click that LI - you wnat to run that function against a particular LI.
[14:24:53] <jquery170>  as the first phase there is the click of the button ( them )
[14:25:05] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:25:07] <robertmaxrees> let me show you what I mean.
[14:25:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8odaLc9e/1/
[14:25:33] <jquery170> i can post also css code.. and i can show the result
[14:25:59] <robertmaxrees> so instead of artificially clicking on that link, you cna just call resizeBorder() and pass in the element you care about.
[14:26:22] <jquery170> robert thank you for post code.  i want also do on window resize
[14:26:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:26:30] <robertmaxrees> are you reaidng anything i'm saying?
[14:26:41] <robertmaxrees> we're changing the problem you need to solve :)
[14:26:53] <jquery170> ahh... :)
[14:27:06] <robertmaxrees> now you can just call that function and pass in the element you care about.
[14:28:03] <jquery170> can i call resizeBorder  in the window resize event?
[14:28:23] <jquery170> i want try
[14:28:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8odaLc9e/2/ this is actually much clearer for names.
[14:28:55] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you call that function.
[14:29:02] <robertmaxrees> be careful though - resize handlers can be very slow.
[14:29:12] <robertmaxrees> I'd make sure you throttle or debounce taht handler.
[14:31:16] <jquery170> yess it work the same, now it's more clear
[14:31:53] <jquery170> but i want get the last li clicked in the $(window).resize(function() {
[14:32:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:32:27] <robertmaxrees> you mean the current active one?
[14:32:36] <jquery170> yes i mean
[14:33:53] <jquery170> i don't know how can get the current active one in the window.resize. I think i must define a var to insert the current
[14:34:47] <robertmaxrees> so are you giving that element a class?
[14:36:52] <jquery170>  I would like to recall it in  the function window.resize
[14:37:01] <robertmaxrees> so to do that you need to select it.
[14:37:11] <jquery170> it is difficult?
[14:37:14] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to set a variable with that information because that means you'll have a global var holding some kind of state.
[14:37:16] <Yepp> setting data via .attr() works but .data() doesn't and .prop() too. Fiddle: http://jsbin.com/resatocuyu/1/edit?js,output
[14:37:27] <robertmaxrees> Yepp how are you confirming that those don't?
[14:37:31] <Yepp> my fiddle
[14:37:39] <robertmaxrees> Yepp are you using the element inspector?
[14:37:53] <Yepp> aside form that. The function of the plugin i am using
[14:38:01] <Yepp> aside from*
[14:38:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:38:36] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: I have a validator plugin. You can exclude an input manually if you'll put data-validate to false
[14:38:46] <robertmaxrees> ah, you mean the validator isn't updating when you set that data attribute.
[14:38:46] <Yepp> setting it via .data() doesn't work
[14:39:01] <Yepp> yes, but using .attr() does
[14:39:04] <robertmaxrees> sounds like they're incorrectly reading the data attribute then.
[14:39:07] <Yepp> even prop does not work
[14:39:17] <robertmaxrees> right, because they're using the wrong api to read those.
[14:39:48] <robertmaxrees> jquery170 so to ask again: are you adding a class to the li that you're clicking?
[14:41:13] <jquery170> robertmaxrees,   not necessarily. i want adding the resizeForAnElement function :)
[14:41:25] <robertmaxrees> jquery170 ...
[14:41:41] <robertmaxrees> dude, you're not reading what i'm saying.  add a class to that li, select that class and pass it to that function.
[14:41:42] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[14:43:03] <jquery170>  he must work on window.resize i want correct the position of div resized...
[14:43:09] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:43:10] <robertmaxrees> and it will.
[14:43:12] <jquery170> can  i show the css with the result?
[14:43:28] <robertmaxrees> because you will select the given element using a class.
[14:43:32] <robertmaxrees> that you give it when you click on it.
[14:43:36] <robertmaxrees> this will give you exactrly what you want.
[14:43:38] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: Ok, I look at the code and he is checking for the element using this.$element.find('[data-validate="true"]')
[14:43:45] <robertmaxrees> Yepp that'd do it.
[14:43:48] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: Would like to make a pull request
[14:43:54] <robertmaxrees> Yepp to whom.
[14:43:56] <Yepp> how do I change it to find using .data?
[14:44:03] <Yepp> to the author of this plugin
[14:44:07] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:44:08] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() and pass a function
[14:44:20] <robertmaxrees> but you'll want to update every place they use data attributes.
[14:44:28] <Yepp> .filter(.data('validate', true)) ??
[14:44:39] <robertmaxrees> you pass it a function
[14:44:57] <robertmaxrees> and then use the getter syntax
[14:45:25] <Yepp> a lil help please: https://github.com/1000hz/bootstrap-validator/blob/master/dist/validator.js#L91
[14:45:34] <robertmaxrees> what don't you understand?
[14:46:00] <Yepp> How to find element using .data() cause if it was me, i'll be doing the same thing too
[14:46:31] <robertmaxrees> so what about my explanation isn't clear?
[14:47:03] <Yepp> eym not quite sure tbh
[14:47:09] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:47:11] <Yepp> an example would be a help
[14:47:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:47:24] <robertmaxrees> is it the filter part?
[14:47:31] <Yepp> yea
[14:47:33] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:47:45] <robertmaxrees> this page has lots of examples.
[14:48:53] <Yepp> so instead of find, i'll be now using filter I assume
[14:48:59] <robertmaxrees> and find.
[14:49:05] <Yepp> oops
[14:49:08] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to find all children and then filter based on .data()
[14:49:47] <jquery170>  robertmaxrees , https://jsfiddle.net/2uwaghkw/   misinterpratation :(
[14:49:48] <Yepp> but how do I use find() there? If originally, find was looking for '[data-validate="true"]'
[14:51:51] <robertmaxrees> don't bind handlers in other handlers.  that's a big no-no.
[14:52:32] <robertmaxrees> Yepp for a freebie: https://bpaste.net/show/8892d42b593a
[14:52:36] <robertmaxrees> it'll look something like this.
[14:52:43] <jquery170> ohhh.  .. i understand your idea.
[14:52:46] <jquery170> thank you
[14:52:48] <jquery170> :)
[14:52:51] <robertmaxrees> but your PR to them will need to include much more Yepp
[14:53:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery170 how'd you get "bind a resize handler in your click handler" out of what i was suggesting?
[14:53:12] <Yepp> ohhh so that's how it is done. Thanks!
[14:53:15] <jquery170> i try now. moment
[14:53:22] <Yepp> I was still trying to understand it
[14:53:46] <Yepp> but that freebie: is for keep. I mean, I can use it the future for similar situation
[14:54:02] <robertmaxrees> i can't guarantee it'll work wioth that plugin.
[14:54:13] <robertmaxrees> because they may very well be using .attr() under the hood for data attributes.
[14:54:20] <robertmaxrees> so you'd need to make a pretty wide-sweeping change.
[14:54:56] <Yepp> But why still need for var allChildren? it is already looking for input elements
[14:55:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:55:26] <Yepp> I mean
[14:55:32] <Yepp> instead of allChildren
[14:55:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:55:45] <robertmaxrees> still lost.
[14:55:54] <Yepp> I got it
[14:55:56] <Yepp> already
[14:55:59] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[14:56:06] <Yepp> but
[14:56:10] <Yepp> was just asking
[14:56:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you're asking.
[14:56:30] <robertmaxrees> this is just matching what it was doing before.
[14:56:31] <Yepp> why not based on what it finds already?
[14:56:44] <Yepp> I mean this
[14:56:45] <Yepp> this.$element.find(Validator.INPUT_SELECTOR)
[14:56:54] <Yepp> why not filter from that? O.o
[14:57:02] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to ask the plugin maintainers.
[14:57:16] <robertmaxrees> actually.
[14:57:27] <robertmaxrees> that's easy - because you may or may not add elkements that match the INPUT_SELECTOR
[14:58:27] <Yepp> meh, it's not I guess. Another example please? If I would be basing from what I'm trying to tell you? instead of allChildren?
[14:58:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:58:38] <robertmaxrees> dude
[14:59:00] <Yepp> I would be filtering from the previous find
[14:59:06] <robertmaxrees> so we don't do that here.
[14:59:21] <Yepp> instead of doing another find.
[14:59:26] <Yepp> Kinda redundant
[14:59:28] <robertmaxrees> you got a freebie - if you need more help, go ahead and try yourself :) if you get stuck, show us your code then.
[14:59:32] <robertmaxrees> it's not redundant at all.
[14:59:33] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[15:00:27] <jquery170> https://jsfiddle.net/2uwaghkw/4/ check the example please
[15:00:48] <robertmaxrees> jquery170 what's the end result you're looking for?
[15:01:41] <jquery170> when resize window i want correct the position of black div resized
[15:02:18] <jquery170> if you try to resize window the div remains in the static position
[15:02:41] <robertmaxrees> because you're convoluting things heh.
[15:02:49] <robertmaxrees> can you see what the problem is?
[15:03:54] <taplar> heh
[15:04:08] <jquery170> i think to solve getting the current li clicked  in the window.resize function
[15:04:13] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:04:15] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:04:20] <robertmaxrees> you've already got that.
[15:04:40] <jquery170> you have suggest me to add a class writing an pretty example. i ve understand
[15:05:00] <robertmaxrees> but apparently you don't because you keep suggesting something different ;)
[15:05:15] <beshoo> i have this html <td class="time-slot" dateTime="00:00" dataDay="1"></td> , and i am trying to reach it via
[15:05:15] <beshoo> $('[dataDay="0"]').find("[dateTime='00:00']").css( "background-color", "red" );
[15:05:27] <robertmaxrees> beshoo you can't create your own attributes.
[15:05:28] <beshoo> but it dos not works
[15:05:36] <robertmaxrees> you need to use data- attributes instead.
[15:06:02] <beshoo> you mean data-[name of ]
[15:06:20] <robertmaxrees> beshoo i mean data- in your html and then use .filter() and .data()
[15:06:22] <taplar> and don't lead off with $('[]').  start with $('.time-slot') and filter
[15:06:23] <Yepp> thanks robert btw. Got it now. Again, the example was a big help :D
[15:06:24] <Yepp> ;)
[15:06:42] <robertmaxrees> Yepp you'll need to change a LOT more code to guarantee that'll work, but alright.
[15:06:52] <robertmaxrees> hey jquery170 try this one: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2uwaghkw/5/
[15:07:01] <robertmaxrees> jquery170 click on a nav item, then resize the window, and then wait.
[15:07:03] <robertmaxrees> and keep waiting.
[15:07:06] <robertmaxrees> watch what happens.
[15:07:10] <Yepp> I submitted an issue already so... hope it'll be fixed
[15:07:13] <beshoo> but $('[dataDay="0"]').css( "background-color", "red" ); this works !
[15:07:20] <robertmaxrees> beshoo that's not a good thing to do.
[15:07:21] <taplar> it's bad performance wise
[15:07:27] <robertmaxrees> attribute selectors are really slow and hard to read.
[15:07:56] <taplar> attribute selector is pretty much a dom scan
[15:08:05] <beshoo> so what is the coreect thing ?
[15:08:09] <taplar> use your class
[15:08:12] <taplar> then filter
[15:08:38] <beshoo> please any eg ,
[15:08:48] <taplar> $('.time-slot').filter(...)
[15:08:48] <robertmaxrees> where are you lost?
[15:08:57] <taplar> easy as that
[15:10:22] <beshoo> will , i want to tell javascript find : <td class="time-slot" dateTime="00:00" dataDay="0"></td> where dateTime = time,and  and dataDay="0".
[15:10:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:10:33] <beshoo> :)
[15:10:36] <taplar> sure, so you fiter on the data fields
[15:10:39] <taplar> *filter
[15:10:46] <robertmaxrees> and don't use those custom attributes.
[15:11:07] <beshoo> Ok let me google filter..
[15:11:15] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[15:12:09] <robertmaxrees> also check out the docs for data.
[15:12:26] <robertmaxrees> jquery170 see how it jumps around?
[15:17:35] <beshoo> so html has to be like this
[15:17:36] <beshoo> <td class="time-slot" data-time="00:00" data-day="0"></td>
[15:17:43] <robertmaxrees> that would be much better.
[15:18:07] <robertmaxrees> .find() is for descendeds btw.  you want .filter()
[15:18:17] <robertmaxrees> *descendents
[15:18:33] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.  enjoy.
[15:20:52] <beshoo> $('[data-day="0"]').find('[data-time="00:00"]').css( "background-color", "red" ); ?
[15:21:10] <taplar> find the class, and then filter on the data fields
[15:21:15] <beshoo> Ok
[15:33:55] <jquery170> robertmaxrees
[15:34:04] <jquery170> you are best
[15:34:19] <jquery170> i see the example work
[15:34:22] <jquery170> :)
[15:37:54] <jquery170> robertmaxrees do you like the concept'?
[16:15:06] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[16:15:42] <robertmaxrees> jquery170 you mean the animation?
[16:32:09] <jquery170> robertmaxrees, yes, now if  i resize window the div border select the li button
[16:32:29] <robertmaxrees> jquery170 i don't really understand why you need the animation, but whatever floats your boat.
[16:32:37] <robertmaxrees> make sure you throttle/debounce that sucker.
[16:34:17] <jquery170> robertmaxrees i have set a different speed for window resize . try example and resize
[16:34:19] <jquery170> https://jsfiddle.net/f3o4osv5/1/
[16:34:30] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change my suggestion.
[16:34:47] <robertmaxrees> you still always want to throttle or debounce inside of a resize handler.
[16:34:55] <robertmaxrees> same thing with a scroll handler
[16:35:49] <robertmaxrees> also: you just needed to use .stop()
[16:35:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f3o4osv5/3/
[16:37:10] <jquery170> yess... it work fine now
[16:37:11] <jquery170> :)
[16:37:14] <jquery170> it works
[16:40:07] <jquery170> robertmaxrees thank you.
[16:40:22] <jquery170>  robertmaxrees , how many years do you study jquery ?
[16:47:35] <robertmaxrees> jquery170 i haven't really "studied" jquery
[16:47:37] <robertmaxrees> i just use it
[16:48:38] <shoky> takes about 15 years to get the hang of it
[16:49:56] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[16:49:59] <robertmaxrees> shoky++
[16:50:30] <shoky> ;]
[16:56:31] <jquery170> robertmaxrees ah ok ok .  how many years do you work for coding the web?
[16:56:36] <Guest95125> hello, I'm trying to have users edit multiple textareas at the same time, is there any native function to jquery that can be used in order to achieve this functionality?
[17:08:24] <Guest95125> _|_
[17:09:43] <neilpdx> are you asking about multiple browsers accessing the same document via a web page?  that is what etherpad is
[18:44:06] <beshoo> hi
[18:44:08] <beshoo> days[$( this ).attr( "data-day" )].push($( this ).attr( "data-time" ))
[18:44:15] <beshoo> why i can not do this ?
[18:44:33] <robertmaxrees> what is  days[$( this ).attr( "data-day" )] ?
[18:44:39] <robertmaxrees> that an object or an array?
[18:44:43] <beshoo> it is the index .
[18:44:46] <beshoo> i 2 3
[18:44:52] <robertmaxrees> you sure it's an array?
[18:45:35] <beshoo> $( this ).attr( "data-day" ) it is just a number of i loop ,
[18:45:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i'm asking.
[18:45:47] <beshoo> then ?
[18:45:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:45:49] <robertmaxrees> days[$( this ).attr( "data-day" )]
[18:45:59] <beshoo> sorry i am newbe
[18:46:13] <robertmaxrees> so days[0] - does that index reference another array?
[18:46:15] <beshoo> var days = new Array();
[18:46:15] <robertmaxrees> or an object?
[18:46:26] <robertmaxrees> fwiw don't use new - just do days = [];
[18:46:37] <robertmaxrees> so now, days[0] - what is this?
[18:46:46] <robertmaxrees> is that an object or an array?
[18:47:19] <beshoo> array
[18:47:29] <robertmaxrees> then you're initializing it wrong :)
[18:47:30] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[18:47:43] <robertmaxrees> oh, and don't use .attr() for data attributes.
[18:47:44] <robertmaxrees> use .data()
[18:48:12] <beshoo> let me show you pastepain .
[18:50:14] <beshoo> http://pastebin.com/Gep3QgcE
[18:50:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, make a fiddle instead.
[18:51:32] <beshoo> let me make it more easy , i want to make an array like this :
[18:51:32] <beshoo> [["01:00","02:00"],["04:00","13:00"]];
[18:51:46] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[18:51:47] <beshoo> ["01:00","02:00"] = day 1
[18:51:47] <robertmaxrees> please.
[18:51:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:51:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't know why you're refusing to do that.
[18:52:08] <beshoo> ok hold :)
[18:52:26] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5vh1d9xe/
[18:53:01] <taplar> you can only push() to arrays
[18:53:16] <robertmaxrees> (that's what i was telling him but i need to see him actually put in effort ;) )
[18:53:25] <beshoo> LOL
[18:53:27] <taplar> yup
[18:53:31] <beshoo> hold i iwll put all thing
[18:54:26] <robertmaxrees> fwiw an array is a really bad idea here.
[18:54:42] <robertmaxrees> also: for loops are hell of gross.
[18:55:16] <taplar> i'd do a filter instead of that inner if
[18:55:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd be mapping all over this sucka.
[18:56:29] <beshoo> https://jsfiddle.net/5vh1d9xe/1/
[18:56:57] <beshoo> now here is the work , target , is to get all selected days as array
[18:57:45] <beshoo> some thing like this : [["01:00","02:00"],["04:00","13:00"]]
[18:57:51] <robertmaxrees> why not do this server-side?
[18:58:21] <beshoo> i will post the selected days to php
[18:58:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:58:32] <beshoo> but i want to formated like [["01:00","02:00"],["04:00","13:00"]]
[18:58:42] <robertmaxrees> you realize that arrays start at 0, right?
[18:58:47] <beshoo> yes
[18:58:49] <robertmaxrees> but days of the month start on 1?
[18:59:02] <beshoo> no problem by that ...
[18:59:04] <robertmaxrees> so you want [,["01:00","02:00"],["04:00","13:00"]]
[18:59:18] <beshoo> no it is not monthly
[18:59:22] <beshoo> weekly
[18:59:31] <robertmaxrees> so there's no 0 week.
[18:59:34] <robertmaxrees> there's a 1 week.
[18:59:37] <robertmaxrees> same with days.
[18:59:44] <robertmaxrees> so you'll have an empty 0th index.
[18:59:58] <beshoo> yes i know that , it is ok if index is 0
[19:00:08] <beshoo> no problem it is just View
[19:00:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:00:16] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.
[19:00:44] <beshoo> i can play with array in php , it is easy , dont know why javascript is so hard :)
[19:01:12] <taplar> your not pushing to an array
[19:01:23] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd rethink this entire setup.
[19:01:39] <robertmaxrees> you're setting yourself up for pain.
[19:01:53] <beshoo> i know , i am learning
[19:02:09] <robertmaxrees> you really should just create a flat array of datetimes.
[19:02:12] <beshoo> that is whay i am here , to learn from Ninga
[19:02:19] <robertmaxrees> you mean ninja?
[19:02:22] <beshoo> YES
[19:02:28] <taplar> who's ninja?
[19:02:30] <beshoo> lol bad english
[19:02:48] <beshoo> who can play with javascript :)
[19:03:00] <robertmaxrees> and preferably you should make each of those in unix epoch time from GMT.
[19:03:07] <robertmaxrees> which will make your life a lot simpler everywhere.
[19:04:03] <beshoo> man - it is just a view ... nothing more ! , i pass this : day = [["01:00","02:00"],["04:00","13:00"]]; to the script , then it color the times
[19:04:30] <beshoo> then user may change by clicking on the time cell ,
[19:04:39] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:04:55] <beshoo> so in this case i will grep by $(".time-slot").each(function( index )
[19:05:07] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[19:05:08] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[19:05:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:05:14] <beshoo> each selected day , has $( this ).attr( "data-selected" ) == 'selected'
[19:05:25] <beshoo> that is it !
[19:05:26] <robertmaxrees> and don't use .attr() for data attributes,
[19:05:43] <beshoo> use .data
[19:06:00] <robertmaxrees> and then use the flat array.
[19:06:21] <beshoo> what is the flat array ?
[19:06:32] <beshoo> day = [["01:00","02:00"],["04:00","13:00"]]; is this a flat ?
[19:06:40] <taplar> that's a 2d array
[19:06:59] <beshoo> aha yes i got you
[19:07:15] <robertmaxrees> just do an array of datetimes.
[19:07:23] <robertmaxrees> it'll be infinitely easier.
[19:07:30] <beshoo> aha
[19:09:08] <beshoo> ok for time been i have to stik with this code , Kindly may you help with the array section .. Please
[19:09:21] <taplar> your not pushing to an array
[19:09:29] <taplar> third time i've hinted that, :P
[19:09:30] <robertmaxrees> ...for the umpteenth time
[19:10:29] <robertmaxrees> here https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5vh1d9xe/2/
[19:10:31] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[19:12:40] <beshoo> sorry i think i dot , days[$( this ).attr( "data-day" )] is this an array ? since var days = new Array();
[19:12:54] <taplar> is it?
[19:13:01] <beshoo> i dont i am asking
[19:13:05] <robertmaxrees> days is probably an array.
[19:13:11] <robertmaxrees> but you don't care about days.
[19:13:19] <taplar> its undefined actually
[19:13:24] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:13:29] <Faizan> Hey. Can somebody help me correct the following syntax: $('a[data-foodtype=') + val.pageID(1, val.length) + ']'.addClass("activeButton");
[19:13:30] <robertmaxrees> because .attr() always returns a string.
[19:13:32] <taplar> your creating an empty array
[19:13:48] <taplar> your trying to push to an array within the array at an index
[19:14:04] <robertmaxrees> taplar he's not even creating an empty array there.  he's trying to access days["0"]
[19:14:06] <robertmaxrees> not days[0]
[19:14:18] <beshoo> AHA
[19:14:20] <taplar> his initialization is Array()
[19:14:32] <taplar> ln 37
[19:14:37] <robertmaxrees> taplar right, but .attr() returns a string.
[19:14:45] <robertmaxrees> so he's accessing days["0"]
[19:14:52] <robertmaxrees> and then trying to push into that.
[19:14:52] <taplar> ah, true
[19:14:57] <robertmaxrees> so he's not even accessing the array index.
[19:15:06] <beshoo> then i need to convert the attr to int ?
[19:15:13] <robertmaxrees> you need to use .data()
[19:15:18] <robertmaxrees> which will convert for you.
[19:15:28] <robertmaxrees> and then create the array at that index if it doesn't yet exist.
[19:15:46] <robertmaxrees> Faizan you should really use .filter() for that instead.
[19:15:52] <taplar> fwiw, data() will do the conversion
[19:16:02] <taplar> crap, missed that
[19:16:03] <Faizan> robertmaxrees: could you give an example?
[19:16:05] <beshoo> you mean $( this ).data( "data-day" )
[19:16:06] <beshoo> ?
[19:16:12] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[19:16:16] <robertmaxrees> .data('day')
[19:16:25] <robertmaxrees> Faizan http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[19:16:35] <robertmaxrees> check out the version that takes a function.
[19:20:48] <Faizan> Is there like a scroll to top function with jquery? www.lazeeztandoori.co.uk/menu#biryani - if you click another button, the page position isn't at the top of the page as I'd like it to be
[19:21:26] <robertmaxrees> see how the url is going to #punjabi, #biryani, etc?
[19:21:49] <Faizan> Yeah, it's going to the container position I understand that
[19:22:18] <robertmaxrees> i assume you want those hashes?
[19:22:27] <Faizan> it's because I chose not to have 15 different pages for the menu, and rather decided to show/hide content with jquery
[19:22:40] <robertmaxrees> 'cause the easiest way to handle this is use hashes that aren't IDs.
[19:23:00] <Faizan> right, and how would that be?
[19:23:07] <Faizan> I wasn't sure what the best way to approach this was
[19:23:20] <robertmaxrees> i usually use hashes that aren't IDs :)
[19:23:30] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you end up having to do some weird scroll preventing.
[19:23:32] <Faizan> so classes instead?
[19:23:40] <Faizan> Ah I get what you mean
[19:23:51] <Faizan> Dang that's gonna be a lot of rewriting though
[19:24:15] <robertmaxrees> you can always look into canceling the scroll conditionally.
[19:24:32] <Faizan> Yeah that's what I was looking to do, you just worded it better
[19:24:40] <Faizan> Any libraries or anything to help get me started?
[19:24:43] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/15950311
[19:24:50] <robertmaxrees> google searches are generally what you want :)
[19:24:59] <robertmaxrees> no need for a full lib in this case.
[19:25:17] <Faizan> Okay, where about in my code should I put that?
[19:25:24] <Faizan> Before/after my hide/show container code?
[19:25:24] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:25:32] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't really matter.
[19:25:34] <Faizan> Sorry that's a really novice question
[19:25:39] <Faizan> Okay
[19:25:39] <robertmaxrees> you could put it anywhere.
[19:25:49] <robertmaxrees> have you done the tutorial on learn.jquery.com?
[19:26:01] <Faizan> I have not.
[19:26:11] <Faizan> I watched a few of Derek Banas' videos on youtube
[19:26:24] <robertmaxrees> i might give that a quick run-through and/or have it handy for questions like that :)
[19:26:32] <Faizan> Thanks for the tip :)
[19:26:53] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[19:26:56] <robertmaxrees> his videos are ancient.
[19:26:58] <Faizan> are #'s in URL's generally bad practice, or nothing wrong with them?
[19:27:20] <Faizan> not even a year old, is that ancient :o
[19:27:25] <robertmaxrees> 2011?
[19:27:28] <Faizan> 2015
[19:27:31] <robertmaxrees> link?
[19:27:34] <Faizan> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWXggB-T1jQ
[19:27:35] <b-ot> (Faizan) JQuery Tutorial - length 1h 14m 26s - 1,281 likes, 21 dislikes (98.4%) - 109,303 views - Derek Banas on 2015.10.14
[19:27:37] <robertmaxrees> and the hashes are just hashes.  are you using them when the page loads to open the right section?
[19:27:49] <Faizan> Yeah
[19:28:06] <robertmaxrees> then you're fine. and i wonder why that video didn't show up at first.
[19:28:18] <Faizan> At first I didn't have anything like that, I used buttons as opposed to anchor tags, and evertyhing was under www.lazeeztandoori.co.uk/menu
[19:28:48] <Faizan> but now that the business wants to run some promotions, it would be useful to link directly to say, #desserts if some rice pudding is on a deal
[19:28:56] <robertmaxrees> sure
[19:29:33] <Faizan> But yeah, I used his video for some quick reference. His videos are normally pretty good
[19:29:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd run through the learning center and have a link to the api docs handy.,
[19:30:00] <Faizan> I will do, thanks
[19:30:07] <robertmaxrees> i get suspect of anybody who doesn't get the casing of the library right hahaha
[19:30:20] <Faizan> that code on stackoverflow doesn't have any effect for some reason
[19:30:36] <robertmaxrees> because it's not exactly what you want probably.
[19:30:36] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:30:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:30:58] <robertmaxrees> open your console - you'll see an error probably.
[19:31:07] <taplar> this website is making me hungry
[19:31:09] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to adapt it to your needs.
[19:32:13] <Faizan> okay I'll check console out
[19:32:24] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com is a  good tutorial on your dev tools.
[19:34:33] <Faizan> Awesome robertmaxrees, fixed it thanks!
[19:34:37] <robertmaxrees> coolio.
[19:36:18] <Faizan> Okay so you recommend the learning center. Anything else that's worthwhile?
[19:36:34] <robertmaxrees> the api docs are awesome.  they contain lots of examples.
[19:36:39] <Faizan> Should I actually learn javascript properly first?
[19:36:48] <robertmaxrees> or alongside.
[19:36:56] <Faizan> Okay
[19:36:58] <Faizan> Thanks
[19:37:14] <Faizan> I have an honours project I should be starting..
[19:37:24] <robertmaxrees> fwiw jquery IS javascript.
[19:37:28] <robertmaxrees> so you're still learning.
[19:37:45] <Faizan> Yeah I know
[19:37:46] <robertmaxrees> just might have some roadblocks to understanding some concepts until you get better with JS.
[19:38:03] <Faizan> but jquery is a library used to make certain things easier
[19:38:08] <robertmaxrees> DOM abstraction.
[19:38:12] <robertmaxrees> not native JS :)
[19:38:31] <Faizan> I like to think of jquery as a utility class
[19:38:37] <robertmaxrees> kind of.
[19:38:42] <Faizan> Just a framework to make things easier
[19:38:42] <robertmaxrees> it's more like a dom abstraction library.
[19:38:47] <Faizan> Yeah
[19:38:54] <arc_> lol -_-
[19:39:01] <arc_> ya i'd say it's more like what it is
[19:39:16] <robertmaxrees> partially because class and javascript aren't really words that belong together.
[19:39:41] <Faizan> For some reason, preventDefault stops jumping to hash when I click any anchor tags, but not when I give a direct link. that's strange
[19:40:58] <Faizan> Wait whaaat
[19:41:28] <arc_> "give a direct link" means what
[19:47:10] <Faizan> robertmaxrees: is there any other way to prevent scrolling? using preventDefault also stops the links #x from being updates
[19:47:13] <Faizan> updated*
[19:50:46] <arc_> Faizan you could manually update it with window.location.hash
[19:52:20] <Faizan> hmm
[19:53:40] <arc_> or you could not use hashes at all and just scroll directly to actual elements
[19:53:49] <arc_> not really sure exactly what you're trying to do
[19:54:22] <arc_> (i didn't read the whole conversation)
[19:54:42] <Faizan> okay if you go onto www.lazeeztandoori.co.uk/menu
[19:55:04] <Faizan> if you click on the left buttons, it runs some jquery code that shows and hides content according to which button is clicked
[19:55:16] <arc_> sure
[19:55:18] <Faizan> but the problem is it jumps to the hash, and I'm trying to avoid that basically
[19:55:27] <arc_> right
[19:55:42] <arc_> well, yeah. what robertmaxrees said
[19:56:37] <arc_> what is the function that's loading the new content
[19:56:45] <arc_> or showing and hiding rather
[19:56:55] <Faizan> i'll pastebin
[19:57:21] <Faizan> http://pastebin.com/FQRbYhqB
[19:57:40] <Faizan> one part of code for direct link and other for button navigation
[19:58:05] <Faizan> ignore the .replace in the latter part of code
[19:58:07] <arc_> yeah ... there is definitely some stuff in here that can be improved
[19:58:23] <Faizan> I'm sure there is lol
[19:59:13] <Faizan> What would you recommend?
[19:59:19] <arc_> so basically you're clicking a button and then taking the hash from the url
[19:59:24] <Faizan> yeah
[19:59:27] <arc_> but you already have that string in data-foodtype
[19:59:30] <Faizan> well for the button click it's not so important
[19:59:33] <arc_> you don't need to take it from the hash
[19:59:36] <Faizan> so you can ignore the location.hash part
[19:59:41] <Faizan> that was just there as a test
[19:59:49] <Faizan> but for the .ready part, that's how I'm doing it yeah
[20:00:13] <arc_> why can't you just have a default section of the menu
[20:00:25] <arc_> what purpose is there for it to open based on the hash
[20:00:36] <arc_> are users coming back to this from another page or something
[20:00:51] <Faizan> So for example if I want to run promotions on say, rice pudding
[20:00:57] <arc_> okay
[20:01:04] <Faizan> then I can link directly to www.lazeeztandoori.co.uk/menu#desserts
[20:01:14] <robertmaxrees> well that was fun.
[20:01:17] <Faizan> if I didn't have this code there would be no way to link directly to desserts
[20:01:39] <arc_> this isn't the only way to do that
[20:01:58] <Faizan> how else would you recommend?
[20:02:28] <arc_> robertmaxrees shouldn't you be able to pass an argument via url like url.com/?desserts
[20:02:50] <robertmaxrees> you can do that, though technically you'd want page=desserts, and that's not super widely supported.
[20:03:23] <arc_> is there a way you would recommend for him to avoid doing this by putting the actual hash in the links
[20:03:40] <TimLoal_> hey all
[20:03:52] <robertmaxrees> use a different hash.
[20:03:53] <arc_> i guess it doesn't matter anyway, if he just sets the hash programmatically instead of setting it by having it in the button itself
[20:03:59] <robertmaxrees> #dessert_section, #main_section, etc.
[20:04:07] <robertmaxrees> then you can just .replace()
[20:04:12] <robertmaxrees> or find another way to directly decouple.
[20:05:32] <TimLoal_> i'm an experianced backend dev trying to understand plugins and widgets, but the seems to be no standard way to do anthing and everyone has their undocumented approach
[20:05:57] <robertmaxrees> TimLoal_ depends on what you mean by "plugins and widgets" :)
[20:06:04] <taplar> such is programming
[20:06:06] <TimLoal_> does anyone know of a set of well documented and exampled plugin patterns
[20:06:24] <robertmaxrees> TimLoal_ for javascript in general?  jquery?  etc.
[20:06:32] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui has its own system for 'em, too
[20:10:30] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[20:11:36] <TimLoal_> robertmaxrees sorry yes for jquery/js i didn't think that was necessairy due to the chanel topic
[20:11:44] <robertmaxrees> so for which?
[20:11:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery or javascript?
[20:12:13] <TimLoal_> jquery
[20:12:22] <robertmaxrees> for jquery, i'd follow the guide set forth in the learning center, unless you've got jquery ui loaded and want to use its plugin syste,
[20:12:24] <robertmaxrees> *system
[20:13:54] <TimLoal_> i've tried almost every example i can find and none of them make sense
[20:14:06] <Faizan> man preventDefault would have done the trick but the problem is that the hash doesn't change either
[20:14:12] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/ TimLoal
[20:14:18] <robertmaxrees> so try this guide.
[20:14:25] <TimLoal_> too many approaches, not enough commenting
[20:14:28] <robertmaxrees> if that still doesn't make sense, let's figure out how we can help it make sense :)
[20:14:47] <TimLoal_> robertmaxrees been there
[20:14:54] <robertmaxrees> so what about it doesn't make sense?
[20:16:31] <TimLoal_> cheers dude, no point asking someone who understands it backwards but forgot they were lost once too
[20:16:39] <robertmaxrees> TimLoal uh
[20:16:45] <robertmaxrees> i remember what it was like.
[20:16:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to understand where you're lost so i can help :)
[20:17:35] <TimLoal_> I think i might just jack in jQuery as still to imature
[20:17:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:17:46] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[20:18:08] <TimLoal_> its a hacks paradise not a professional technology
[20:18:12] <arc_> lol
[20:18:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:18:27] <taplar> i don't understand it so.... unprofessional it must be
[20:18:30] <TimLoal_> :)
[20:18:37] <robertmaxrees> then feel free to leave the channel :)
[20:18:53] <robertmaxrees> been around 10 years, plenty of people find it useful.  if you don't, great!
[20:19:05] <arc_> yeah that's why 80% of the time when you go to one of the most popular websites you can put jquery code in the console and it works
[20:19:06] <TimLoal_> why because the first person couldn't help
[20:19:09] <robertmaxrees> uh
[20:19:37] <taplar> what was that theory someone mentioned the other day?  D something?
[20:19:38] <robertmaxrees> because we don't know when you're lost.
[20:19:43] <robertmaxrees> dunning-krueger.
[20:19:44] <robertmaxrees> haha
[20:19:46] <taplar> yeah
[20:19:48] <taplar> odd timing
[20:20:15] <arc_> that applies to everyone :D
[20:20:21] <TimLoal_> its not like i just read one turorial and am now crying for not getting it
[20:20:23] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[20:20:29] <arc_> not equally though lol ;)
[20:20:29] <robertmaxrees> we're not saying you are, TimLoal_
[20:20:48] <robertmaxrees> but when somebody offers to help you understand and your first reaction is to insult the library and people in this channel?
[20:20:50] <robertmaxrees> kind of weird.
[20:20:53] <TimLoal_> i've been reading and watching mountains, but there is no standard approach
[20:21:05] <arc_> standard approach to what
[20:21:05] <taplar> why do you need a standard?
[20:21:10] <robertmaxrees> for jquery, there's the way the learning center suggests.  you can follow that pattern or make your own.
[20:21:19] <robertmaxrees> that's not a fault of the library.  that's a fault of choice.
[20:21:32] <arc_> if you ask 100 professional programmers to do a task you will get 100 different answers
[20:21:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:22:00] <taplar> i disagree
[20:22:06] <taplar> lots would google and find the same answer, :P
[20:22:09] <arc_> heh
[20:22:09] <robertmaxrees> hgahahahaha
[20:22:26] <TimLoal_> to make my own i need to understand it, ususally to understand it i have a go at building something basic or break/fix an existing module
[20:22:40] <robertmaxrees> so them build something basic.
[20:22:51] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.someCrazyPlugin = function() {};
[20:23:54] <TimLoal_> thats not really a plugin in my book its an external function
[20:24:15] <robertmaxrees> so i think that's the first part of your confusion - in jquery, extending $.fn is a "plugin"
[20:24:18] <robertmaxrees> they're basically all that.
[20:24:28] <robertmaxrees> you are assigning some custom name to a function.
[20:24:33] <arc_> i actually don't know what is the difference between a plugin and a function
[20:25:07] <taplar> eh, i attribute a plugin to basicly a namespace within jquery
[20:25:18] <robertmaxrees> arc_ plugins are generally functions.
[20:25:28] <TimLoal_> a plugin in my book would have more than one function for a start
[20:25:41] <taplar> 'dialog' is a namespace, but it does a lot
[20:25:43] <robertmaxrees> "in my book" - you keep saying that :)
[20:25:58] <robertmaxrees> i think part of the confusion is you're conflating what plugin means.
[20:26:09] <robertmaxrees> it's simply extending what jquery does.
[20:27:20] <taplar> here's a question though.  why do you need a 'plugin' ?
[20:28:12] <taplar> is this something for yourself, or are you wanting to write something for everyone?
[20:28:37] <TimLoal_> to scale some JS i have for a treview, so i needs to do a lot more than add a mono-function plugin
[20:28:48] <taplar> but are you going to share it?
[20:28:58] <robertmaxrees> you can do what jqui/bootstrap/etc do and accept strings to control behavior fwiw.
[20:29:03] <robertmaxrees> they still expose a single method name.
[20:29:18] <arc_> but like, what's really the difference between $.fn.pluginName = function () {}; and just function pluginName () {}
[20:29:28] <TimLoal_> all told it probably needs a suite of plugins but thats right at the other end if the spectrum and i havent seen any discussion on it
[20:29:30] <robertmaxrees> arc_ one extends the jquery object.
[20:29:38] <taplar> cause if all your wanting to do is group together a bunch of functions pertaining to something, a simple namespace will do that
[20:29:48] <arc_> if your function acts on jquery objects anyway, does it matter?
[20:30:00] <arc_> i'm sure you can tell this is above my head
[20:30:03] <robertmaxrees> arc_ some people get really weird about wanting things on $
[20:30:10] <arc_> heh i see
[20:30:15] <robertmaxrees> plus that makes it globally available in most places.
[20:30:21] <robertmaxrees> unles you're using a module loader.
[20:30:47] <TimLoal_> i want to reuse it, i hope thats not too weird for you
[20:31:03] <taplar> so, it's just for you, but you want to reuse it
[20:31:13] <robertmaxrees> you could make a backbone view or something.
[20:31:25] <robertmaxrees> like, nobody said it has to be attached to jquery :)
[20:31:31] <taplar> ^
[20:31:31] <robertmaxrees> plenty of ways to accomplish something like this.
[20:31:40] <TimLoal_> taplar who said it was just for me?
[20:31:47] <taplar> so it's not?
[20:31:56] <robertmaxrees> he's just trying to understand your intended audience duder.
[20:31:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:32:31] <arc_> i'm not sure why but you seem more defensive than seems appropriate for how they are responding to you
[20:32:33] <TimLoal_> jQuery is a logical progression from JS with many benefits
[20:32:50] <taplar> it's not a progression though.
[20:32:56] <robertmaxrees> TimLoal it's not meant for that.
[20:32:56] <TimLoal_> taplar reality isnt binary
[20:33:02] <robertmaxrees> it's a DOM abstraction library.
[20:33:04] <taplar> lol
[20:33:47] <taplar> so, it may or may not be for other people, or not.  you can't tell me.  cause it's hard to say
[20:33:51] <Faizan> robertmaxrees: sorry to dwell back on my problem. Were you saying a possible solution was to link to an ID that doesn't actually exist?
[20:33:51] <taplar> have fun
[20:34:01] <robertmaxrees> TimLoal_ if you don't like the library, don't use it.  simple fix :)
[20:34:01] <Faizan> and when showing/hiding content, just change the hash accordingly
[20:34:06] <robertmaxrees> Faizan yep.
[20:34:18] <Faizan> I just read up in more detail and it seems so obvious
[20:34:24] <Faizan> I just wasn't quite sure what you were saying at the time
[20:34:26] <Faizan> i gotcha now!
[20:34:29] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[20:34:44] <Faizan> so i'm linking to #dessert, #rice etc
[20:34:52] <Faizan> but then the actual id is #dessert-content
[20:34:58] <arc_> sure
[20:35:04] <Faizan> so I wouild just append "-content" and show that container
[20:35:20] <arc_> that would work
[20:35:29] <Faizan> awesome
[20:35:32] <Faizan> thanks guys
[20:37:38] <TimLoal_> ok i'll pass by jQuery and stick minimal reliance on the client for functionality
[20:37:49] <Faizan> If I have something like var pageID = window.location.hash, and I want to append "-content" to pageID
[20:37:57] <robertmaxrees> TimLoal awesome :)
[20:38:00] <Faizan> would it just be $(pageID + "-content")
[20:38:06] <Faizan> since that doesn't seem to do the trick
[20:38:07] <arc_> ya
[20:38:18] <Faizan> okay must be another problem, thanks!
[20:38:20] <robertmaxrees> Faizan might need a '#' + in front of pageID
[20:38:21] <TimLoal_> its a pitty the OS community is so lazy and lax
[20:38:21] <arc_> well wait
[20:38:31] <arc_> what are you doing with that
[20:38:42] <Faizan> that's to show the relevant class
[20:39:01] <Faizan> $(pageID + "-content").removeClass('menu-hidden'); // Unhide clicked container
[20:39:11] <arc_> TimLoal_ i have had nothing but good experiences with jquery and this channel so maybe the problem isn't with whatever you think it is
[20:39:19] <robertmaxrees> and you updated your HTML Faizan?
[20:39:28] <Faizan> yeah html is updated
[20:39:30] <Faizan> but let me double check
[20:39:39] <Faizan> it's late and i should probably be sleeping
[20:39:46] <arc_> idk if window.location.hash returns #hash or just hash
[20:39:52] <Faizan> it returns #has
[20:39:54] <Faizan> #hash*
[20:39:57] <arc_> ok
[20:40:28] <Faizan> ok wtf
[20:40:35] <Faizan> all I changed was single quotes
[20:40:43] <Faizan> I had "-content" first, '-content' fixed it?
[20:40:58] <arc_> maybe it was '" or "' and you just didn't notice it
[20:41:06] <Faizan> possibly :p
[20:41:11] <Faizan> because it doesn't make sense otherwise
[20:41:14] <arc_> i agree
[20:52:20] <taplar> o.O
[20:53:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:53:45] <taplar> lol, just randomly wanted an apple?
[20:54:24] <robertmaxrees> nah
[20:57:58] <Faizan> Oh wow
[20:58:03] <Faizan> an op who isn't an ass
[20:58:15] <Faizan> not common in the css channel lol
[20:58:29] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[20:59:03] <Faizan> See at least one person get banned everyday for a simple highlight
[20:59:06] <taplar> odd given that its topic is about making things look better
[20:59:25] <Faizan> Haha right
[20:59:40] <robertmaxrees> heh, they run a slightly different show over there.  It's all good.
[21:35:56] <taplar> heh, stupid joke
[21:36:17] <taplar> an awesome mushroom.  a fun guy
[21:36:40] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
