[00:14:55] <Narhir-> sorry guys I got disconnected did anyone replied regading my jquery selector issues ?;/ https://jsfiddle.net/xcgom65e/
[00:16:20] <arthurvr> Narhir-: I don’t think so, you can always check the logs at http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20150515.log.html#t23:37:09
[00:17:34] <Narhir-> nope nothing :/
[01:05:55] <lilalinuxKL> why are .filter and .not so horribly slow?
[01:16:23] <arthurvr> lilalinuxKL: Where are you running into?
[01:20:01] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: If I fire the selector on the whole document it takes no time, but if I use filter on a subset, it takes 10 seconds
[01:20:30] <arthurvr> lilalinuxKL: that seems strange. Fiddle or jsbin would be nice.
[01:22:13] <lilalinuxKL> i'll try to create one
[01:22:19] <arthurvr> awesome
[02:21:50] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: https://jsfiddle.net/7cqvL83k/2/
[02:24:45] <arthurvr> okay let me take a look lilalinuxKL
[02:24:50] <lilalinuxKL> wait
[02:24:53] <lilalinuxKL> there's an error
[02:25:28] <arthurvr> ping me when you figured it out
[02:25:35] <lilalinuxKL> man, saves are so slow
[02:25:46] <arthurvr> jshint has been slow all week
[02:25:52] <arthurvr> s/jshint/jsfiddle
[02:26:40] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: done
[02:27:45] <arthurvr> looks like at all nothing is rendering. Is that expected?
[02:27:56] <lilalinuxKL> the .filter() can be replaced with a plain selector, speeding things up a lot, but I have no alternative to the .not()
[02:28:05] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: it takes 20s
[02:28:31] <arthurvr> no the fiddle is already loaded, it just doesn’t do anything it seems
[02:28:50] <lilalinuxKL> here it does
[02:29:16] <lilalinuxKL> ah, the url changes with each save
[02:29:19] <lilalinuxKL> https://jsfiddle.net/7cqvL83k/6/
[02:29:25] <arthurvr> yeah that makes sense
[02:29:33] <arthurvr> ok 5 minutes
[02:30:48] <arthurvr> this is one of the worst performant pages I ever saw for such little demos.
[02:30:55] <lilalinuxKL> :-)
[02:30:59] <arthurvr> it’s perhaps anyways not a good idea to have such a table :/
[02:30:59] <lilalinuxKL> it is
[02:31:30] <lilalinuxKL> yea, but I fear the performance is due to jquery
[02:31:44] <lilalinuxKL> there's no reason why the filter should take so long
[02:31:51] <arthurvr> first thing I see is a massive use of .hide() and .show() on a supper big dom. That’s something we explicitly warn about on the api docs.
[02:32:05] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: the hide and show take 0 time
[02:32:13] <lilalinuxKL> it's only the .not() and the .filter()
[02:32:44] <lilalinuxKL> the filter can be workarounded by a plain selector
[02:33:41] <lilalinuxKL> https://jsfiddle.net/7cqvL83k/7/
[02:33:52] <lilalinuxKL> this takes only 10s (halfed)
[02:34:41] <lilalinuxKL> it's really only the subselects
[02:36:24] <arthurvr> w8 a minute
[02:40:17] <arthurvr> lilalinuxKL: nah It’s def. going to be better to not use .hide() / .show() here.
[02:40:25] <arthurvr> use some kind of .hidden() class instead
[02:40:34] <arthurvr> it’s terribly slow on huge documents
[02:41:00] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: maybe, but without the filter it is 10s faster
[02:41:28] <arthurvr> lilalinuxKL: that’s also true, but you’re not going to be able to do anything about that (even if you’re not using jquery)
[02:42:22] <arthurvr> expect if you search another approach to have this kind of data on the page. this kind of things are never a good idea
[02:43:49] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: https://jsfiddle.net/lilalinux/7cqvL83k/9/
[02:44:02] <lilalinuxKL> completely removed show and hide
[02:44:05] <lintguy> How do i declare a variable in a higher scope on a namespace?
[02:44:06] <lilalinuxKL> still takes 40s
[02:44:37] <arc_> what is "spr"
[02:44:59] <arthurvr> lilalinuxKL: you shouldn’t be debugging this way :) jsfiddle is slow as well :)
[02:45:07] <arthurvr> and yeah please first explain your use case of this.
[02:45:14] <arthurvr> it seems like a terrible idea over all
[02:45:45] <lilalinuxKL> it's a table of issues grouped by domains and sprints. There is a filter control, which lets you hide some domains and sprints
[02:46:15] <arc_> lintguy i was just trying to access a variable out of scope yesterday. what i was told to do was use .data or set a class on the object in question. don't know if the latter helps in your case
[02:46:47] <lintguy> arc_: Yeah, i thought about using a cookie, but it seems extremely overkill...
[02:46:55] <arthurvr> lilalinuxKL: and what’s the deal with not using pagination (or whatever else which is better then a super big dom)
[02:47:20] <arthurvr> lintguy: how does your code look? There should be a better solution. Or just declare a variable before assigning it a value.
[02:47:46] <arc_> ah, i never thought of that. lol wow amateur
[02:47:52] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: not my choice, the customer wants a big sheet like in excel
[02:48:18] <lilalinuxKL> and the code takes the same time in the real code, so the impact of jsfiddle is minimal
[02:48:19] <lintguy> arthurvr: It's just a function that i call to increase a counter.
[02:48:35] <lintguy> arthurvr: if i pass the value to a function parameter, that would work right?
[02:48:45] <lintguy> arthurvr: that way i can reset the value if needed as well.
[02:48:58] <arthurvr> lintguy: yeah that sounds reasonable though a fiddle/jsbin and I would show it off :D
[02:49:22] <arthurvr> lilalinuxKL: never thought about server-side?
[02:49:31] <lintguy> arthurvr: I'll test these alternatives and see what seems most feasible.
[02:50:08] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: no need for server side, I could just re-render the template in JS, which would take no time at all
[02:50:34] <lilalinuxKL> but then I wouldn't have animations
[02:50:59] <lilalinuxKL> soy template that is
[02:51:05] <arthurvr> I don’t think so, but good luck lilalinuxKL :)
[02:52:45] <lintguy> Um, that didn't work well
[02:52:58] <arthurvr> lintguy: fiddle or jsbin please
[02:53:03] <arthurvr> !paste @ lintguy
[02:53:04] <lintguy> If i pass count as a number to the function and then add +1 to it, i get NaN
[02:53:26] <lintguy> arthurvr: Yeah, i'm on my way
[02:53:31] <arthurvr> awesome
[02:53:40] <arc_> yeah that won't work. isn't it a constant within the scope of that function
[02:54:56] <arc_> i mean .. you could create a local variable and return the value of the passed variable + however many times you incremented it
[02:55:27] <bqn> hey
[02:56:09] <bqn> how do I detach a .click() event?
[02:56:16] <arthurvr> it’s right on the API docs: http://api.jquery.com/click/. Command-f for ”as the .click(”
[02:56:25] <bqn> oh
[02:56:25] <bqn> okay
[02:57:17] <bqn> how did you track that sentence down that quick?
[02:57:39] <arthurvr> command+f and because I was the one that recently added that sentence
[02:57:45] <arc_> lol
[02:57:50] <bqn> what do you mean? You added it?
[02:58:05] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/commit/e420da6cacea0f08c528b7a5eeb376ad64c52f32
[02:58:08] <arthurvr> I’m a team member :)
[02:58:19] <bqn> ah okay
[02:58:22] <bqn> well that makes sense
[02:59:56] <bqn> I gotta leave. Nice to meet you arc_ and arthurvr. See you later
[03:01:22] <arthurvr> yw bqn
[03:05:45] <lintguy> Now it works :)
[03:07:00] <arthurvr> lintguy: awesome :)
[03:07:18] <lintguy> I just needed to put the variable outside of the scope
[03:08:48] <arthurvr> yeah as I told you just declare it in an upper scope and assign the value inside
[03:09:18] <lintguy> Yeah, i tried that but got some error, but it was caused by an extra space…
[03:09:27] <arthurvr> oh okay
[03:09:48] <lintguy> At least i think so, so i made the conclusion that i had to put the var in the same namespace but that's not even possible.
[03:09:54] <lintguy> Or i don't think it is
[03:10:02] <lintguy> is it?
[03:10:09] <lintguy> Namespaces are only for functions right?
[03:10:33] <arthurvr> well in ES6 you have block scope as well
[03:11:31] <lintguy> What the crap
[03:12:01] <lintguy> I wanted to reset the counter to zero when the function are done, so i did var counter = 0; and then it becomes NaN
[03:12:04] <lintguy> What gives?
[03:12:10] <lintguy> Do i need to do parsefloat on it?
[03:13:07] <lintguy> No, doesn't seem to help
[03:13:53] <arthurvr> lintguy: as I sad, please do a fiddle if you run into additional problems. generally this is some kind of type convertion going wrong
[03:13:57] <Left_Turn> is jquery secure when making requests that also send over credentials?
[03:14:21] <arthurvr> Left_Turn: depends on how you use it :)
[03:14:35] <Left_Turn> hm
[03:14:55] <lintguy> http://jsfiddle.net/xkep86ea/3/
[03:15:35] <lintguy> Left_Turn: The page and script need to load and send to and from HTTPS
[03:16:06] <Left_Turn> ah i see lintguy
[03:16:41] <lintguy> Left_Turn: A classic failure is sending sensitive data from a http site to a https site, then the data will not be encrypted during transfer.
[03:17:31] <Left_Turn> yes i'll have to try to avoid doing that now.. thanks:)
[03:18:33] <lintguy> arthurvr: did you see the fiddle?
[03:18:48] <arthurvr> yeah I just don’t have much time :)
[03:18:52] <arthurvr> but let me take a look
[03:19:16] <arthurvr> lintguy: and where exactly do you see the NaN
[03:19:30] <lintguy> lintguy: Not here, but there is actually nothing logged.
[03:19:40] <lintguy> Should at least show 0
[03:21:02] <arthurvr> let me quickly rewrite that. Looks a little crappy as-is
[03:21:18] <lintguy> Um, ok
[03:21:28] <arthurvr> what’s the deal with the global?
[03:21:55] <lintguy> Isn't it good practise to have the code in it's own namespace?
[03:22:01] <lintguy> Or you mean count?
[03:22:03] <arthurvr> yeah but not in window
[03:22:13] <arthurvr> globals can conflict you know
[03:22:31] <arthurvr> everybody can access and use `window` (the global namespace)
[03:22:45] <arthurvr> might be interested in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9WKcsiADi4
[03:23:08] <lintguy> Hm, but i'm assigning it to window.c not window
[03:23:21] <arthurvr> well yeah that’s the problem actually
[03:23:32] <arthurvr> like that you’re adding things to the global namespace
[03:23:45] <arthurvr> http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil
[03:25:14] <lintguy> So how should i assign it to it's own namespace?
[03:26:03] <arthurvr> you lack some basic knowledge of what globals are and why they’re bad so maybe read up on that first :) Depends on what you’re planning to use that namespace for
[03:27:04] <lintguy> I already know why they are bad and i've had this argument before on IRC, back then everyone said to assign it to window.somenamespace
[03:27:11] <lintguy> So that's what i did
[03:27:27] <arthurvr> well it’s better to not do that :)
[03:27:38] <arthurvr> globals are bad in any way
[03:28:02] <lintguy> This is how i previously did it:
[03:28:38] <lintguy> jQuery.namespace( 'jQuery.something' );
[03:28:38] <lintguy> jQuery.something.test = function() { something };
[03:28:59] <lintguy> But using $ instead
[03:29:12] <lintguy> Then someone there was this large argument on how it was bad
[03:29:17] <lintguy> so i changed to windows.something
[03:29:21] <lintguy> window*
[03:30:08] <arthurvr> was jQuery.namespace some kind of plugin? it’s not a jQuery core feature
[03:30:21] <arthurvr> anyways anyting that doesn’t create globals is better
[03:32:30] <lintguy> arthurvr: Then how do you namespace your code?
[03:33:10] <arthurvr> I use browserify :)
[03:34:09] <lintguy> arthurvr: Anyway, the fiddle still don't give my and 0 http://jsfiddle.net/xkep86ea/4/
[03:34:43] <arthurvr> lintguy: http://jsfiddle.net/xkep86ea/6/ :)
[03:35:34] <lintguy> arthurvr: Yeah, but how do i reset the counter to zero.
[03:35:54] <arthurvr> count = 0 seems pretty easy
[03:36:10] <lintguy> That's what i did right?
[03:36:34] <arthurvr> did you take a look at the fiddle I posted?
[03:37:15] <lintguy> Yes, but if i add the reset http://jsfiddle.net/xkep86ea/9/
[03:37:35] <lintguy> Oh, so i'm not to use var ?
[03:37:54] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: https://jsfiddle.net/lilalinux/7cqvL83k/10/
[03:38:06] <lilalinuxKL> with plain js 2s
[03:38:26] <arthurvr> this isn’t doing the same thing as well.
[03:38:49] <arthurvr> it covers your use case but doesn’t do the same thing, in fact
[03:38:53] <arthurvr> anyways I’m off
[03:39:04] <lilalinuxKL> true
[03:39:43] <lintguy> arthurvr: i get it, when changing a var variable value you don't declare it as a variable again...
[03:39:51] <lintguy> arthurvr: thanks for the help
[03:39:56] <lintguy> sorry for me being so daft
[03:40:16] <arthurvr> lintguy: well when you leave out the var keyword you declare it as a global
[03:40:20] <arthurvr> lintguy: bye,
[03:40:46] <lintguy> Bye
[03:43:55] <lintguy> arthurvr: Actually, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with having the namespace in the global scope. http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-function-namespacing-plain-english/
[03:44:26] <arthurvr> lintguy: see the date of that article? There wasn’t anything better back then
[03:45:00] <lintguy> So what have changed?
[03:45:33] <arthurvr> these days we have AMD and things like browserify to save us from this hell of global scoping. Ideally you never need to touch the global scope anymore
[03:46:07] <arthurvr> anyways i gotta leave. it’s your decision but I just want to warn that it’s generally consider bad practise.
[03:46:13] <lintguy> I'll check out browserify then, thanks again
[03:46:41] <lintguy> I really appreciate the help, i wan't to do it properly.
[03:46:48] <lintguy> But to do that, i need to understand why
[03:46:55] <arthurvr> :)
[03:49:55] <lilalinuxKL> arthurvr: using classes instead of hide() further sped things up, it's now <2s. thank you for your patience :-)
[03:50:31] <lintguy> lilalinuxKL: hide() is slow?
[03:50:47] <lilalinuxKL> lintguy: it sums up
[03:51:08] <lintguy> lilalinuxKL: So instead you add a class with hidden style?
[03:51:18] <lilalinuxKL> lintguy: display style, yes
[03:52:17] <lilalinuxKL> the table with 6000 cells took ~2.5s with hide and ~1.5s with display:none
[03:55:36] <arthurvr> lilalinuxKL: lintguy: yes classes are faster then .hide() and .show(). Generally you shouldn’t care but in big documents it makes sense.
[03:56:06] <arthurvr> 6000 times .show() would mean 6000 repaints :)
[04:03:29] <lintguy> Good to know :)
[04:33:21] <kasper_> Hello everyone. Im trying to have a div slide in from the left, when I click a button. I can get it to work with one div, but I need it to work with a lot of divs using the same class. Right now, when I click one button all the divs slide in. I know I need to use relative elements, but I cant get it to work. Hope you can help me. Heres a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQTFq/2663/
[04:36:51] <arc_> well yes because you are selecting them via a class that they all share
[04:37:36] <kasper_> Yes, I think I need to use "this" somehow to get the closest div, right?
[04:38:49] <arc_> are you able to assign an id to each object in html
[04:39:26] <kasper_> Yes I am
[04:39:42] <kasper_> but I need to use it like 20 times
[04:40:05] <kasper_> as in #id1 #id2 #id3 etc thats why I thought using a class was easier
[04:43:41] <Narhir> hey guys.. I have this jquery module.. and I'm trying to make it work with values that are inside a div :(
[04:43:45] <Narhir> anyone willing to take a look ?
[04:43:51] <Narhir> it only works if the values are not nested in div..
[04:45:19] <Narhir> https://jsfiddle.net/zo013uoe/
[04:45:36] <Narhir> and the website where it doesnt work is this: http://www.79level.pl/kalkulator-ile-kosztuje-stworzenie-strony-www
[04:48:38] <kasper_> Anyone who can help? :-)
[04:49:11] <arc_> kasper_ http://jsfiddle.net/ZQTFq/2664/
[04:49:41] <kasper_> awesome arc! :-)
[04:50:02] <arc_> also, you don't need to have an href inside <a> tag. if you put href="#" the link will always scroll the browser to the top
[04:50:24] <arc_> you can put cursor: hand; in the css to change the cursor
[04:51:05] <arc_> although that isn't fully compatible with all browsers ... there's a page somewhere describing how to do it the fully correct way
[04:51:20] <kasper_> aha yeah. Thanks a lot for the help
[04:51:24] <arc_> np
[04:52:05] <Woet> Narhir: try turning your jsfiddle into a working demo that actually demonstrates your problem.
[04:52:35] <Narhir> Good idea let me do it in a second
[04:52:54] <Falbala> I try to append a function to a div but when I do this the whole website is gone and only the return of the function is visible on a blank page  $(".divclass").empty();   $(".divclass").append("<script>function();<\/script>");
[04:53:02] <Falbala> with a simple text it works
[04:53:25] <Falbala> is there a special way to append js functions?
[04:54:29] <Falbala> I use a click event to trigger this
[04:57:00] <Uhkis> Falbala: just do your thing after the append
[05:00:20] <Falbala> Uhkis: what do you mean?
[05:00:46] <Woet> hi Uhkis
[05:01:11] <Uhkis> Falbala: like append('whatever that script does')
[05:01:12] <Uhkis> yo Woet
[05:08:12] <Narhir> well I was unable even to make it work on jsfiddle :/
[05:08:12] <Narhir> https://jsfiddle.net/zo013uoe/2/
[05:08:34] <Narhir> it work on my website tough
[05:12:08] <Uhkis> yeah, that's gonna need some explanation, we have no idea what you're trying to accomplish
[05:12:46] <Narhir> can I explain ?
[05:13:01] <Narhir> if you would go for example here: http://www.79level.pl/kalkulator-ile-kosztuje-stworzenie-strony-www
[05:13:11] <Narhir> it all works as it should you click on different checkboxes and it calculate the price
[05:13:14] <Narhir> as it should..
[05:13:43] <Uhkis> and the problem is?
[05:13:46] <Narhir> However if I enable " iCheck " then the script doesnt work any longer as I think is caused because fo the fact that the "pre icheck" version of script have label + input on same level
[05:13:52] <LaravelBoom> #cakephp
[05:14:09] <Narhir> however in iCheck the label is on same levle with div in which the input is..
[05:14:15] <Narhir> let me enable the icheck to demonstrate the issue
[05:14:39] <LaravelBoom> Hi guys
[05:14:43] <LaravelBoom> how r u ?
[05:14:44] <Narhir> now I enabled the icheck: http://www.79level.pl/kalkulator-ile-kosztuje-stworzenie-strony-www
[05:14:56] <Narhir> and you can see it looks nicer BUT it doesnt calculate the price any more :(
[05:15:08] <Narhir> and I tought it must be releated to the calculator script which was designed to the rpevious markup...
[05:15:18] <Narhir> so I was trying to modify this script in order for it to work with icheck markup
[05:17:36] <Uhkis> i don't see any difference, except for the javascript error
[05:17:59] <Uhkis> and the calculator seems to work fine?
[05:23:40] <Narhir> hmm
[05:23:42] <Narhir> it doesnt work for me
[05:23:58] <Narhir> what browser are you using?
[05:24:50] <Narhir> the icheck is not beign loaded for anoynmosue users
[05:25:39] <Narhir> I flushed caches could you take a look now ?
[05:30:31] <Narhir> any suggestions Uhkis ?
[05:30:45] <LaravelBoom> I am everywhere
[05:31:19] <Narhir> I believe :D
[05:37:23] <earational> hey ; /clearall
[05:38:48] <Narhir> oh well.. no luck :)
[05:38:56] <Narhir> doesnt work :/ how frustrating
[05:39:06] <Narhir> maybe module developer will get back after I ccreated the issue but I doubt that..
[05:58:39] <RabSimpson> hi folks. i'm using .val() to change the value of a form submit button, and i'd like to include a special character. when i add &#10142; to it it just outputs that instead of the character. any ideas?
[05:59:02] <Narhir> Hi ;d
[05:59:46] <RabSimpson> i've tried it using regular html entities and unicode hexidecimal, but no luck.
[06:01:02] <Uhkis> RabSimpson: use the actual character
[06:01:51] <RabSimpson> uhkis: copy and paste the character as-is directly into my js?
[06:01:59] <Uhkis> yes
[06:04:10] <RabSimpson> that appears to have done the trick, thanks :)
[06:07:43] <Narhir> Uhkis:  did you took a look at it ?
[06:09:45] <abara> hey guys
[06:10:57] <arthurvr> hey abara
[06:11:13] <arthurvr> what’s up?
[06:12:43] <abara> dude, i'm using jqueryUI draggable and droppable, so on droppable we have event and ui arguments. i want to access an attribute of the element who is being dropped. How can i do that?
[06:22:55] <Uhkis> Narhir: you're better off asking the original developer
[06:26:07] <Narhir> yeah.. already created issue
[06:26:09] <Narhir> will have to wait :(
[06:26:34] <Uhkis> Narhir: have you checked if the developer is in #drupal or #drupal-contribute ?
[06:34:57] <Narhir> yeah he is not...
[06:35:02] <Narhir> also tried to find him on /quer nick
[06:35:12] <Narhir> yhh... /query nick*
[06:54:04] <sadtaco> Is there a good plugin that makes creating a tutorial easier?  Like I need to dull out most of the sight to highly a certain area and add some tutorial text by that highlighted element.
[06:54:33] <sadtaco> Googling for one... I find jquery tutorials.
[06:55:25] <Jattenalle> sadtaco, simple enough, something along the lines of: $('.allMyElements :not(.currentTutorial').addClass('MyFancyBlurThing');
[06:56:14] <sadtaco> Eh?  But how would I dull them in that way?  If i change opacity you'll get ugly stacking stuff and opacity multiplication propagations
[06:56:25] <sadtaco> The element needs to be copied and positioned perfectly over top of a modal background...
[06:57:05] <Jattenalle> yeah?
[06:57:17] <Jattenalle> if you want to layer a canvas ontop of your other elements for fancy blur or whatnot
[06:57:21] <Jattenalle> that's straightforward as well
[06:57:55] <Jattenalle> $(myNewCanvasThing).Width($('.ThingItIsCovering').Width()); and so on
[06:58:13] <sadtaco> eh?... it still needs to be behind it.
[06:58:16] <Jattenalle> i mean, it takes a bit of code, but it's all fairly straightforward code
[06:58:24] <Jattenalle> what needs to be behind it?
[06:59:59] <sadtaco> The canvas or element that is giving the effect to everything underneath...
[07:00:37] <decx> what's this for?
[07:00:44] <decx> i thought i read something about a tutorial
[07:00:52] <Jattenalle> decx,
[07:00:53] <Jattenalle> [15:54:07] <sadtaco> Is there a good plugin that makes creating a tutorial easier?  Like I need to dull out most of the sight to highly a certain area and add some tutorial text by that highlighted element.
[07:01:19] <decx> http://usablica.github.io/intro.js/
[07:01:22] <sadtaco> wow I typod that bad
[07:01:24] <sadtaco> site, highlight*
[07:01:36] <sadtaco> YES, like that!
[07:01:52] <Jattenalle> nice decx
[07:20:09] <sadtaco> Gah...
[07:20:21] <sadtaco> This doesn't use proper selectors like with sizzle. It's only element ids.
[07:20:23] <sadtaco> HAving to id everything sucks
[07:21:34] <rindolf> Hi all. How can I use a sequential version of http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ in a loop in a way which won't cause too deep a stack recursion?
[07:24:08] <sadtaco> Bootstrap tour looks nicer htouh. Found that
[07:32:29] <lintguy> Is there any way to avoid having the browser load images from cache?
[07:32:50] <lintguy> I'm trying to update an image after uploading it, but it always loads the one from browser cache.
[07:35:50] <lintguy> Nvm, i'll just add a random string
[07:35:55] <rindolf> lintguy: I don't know how to do that off-hand , but I know the browser: 1. Does not cache https:// URLs. 2. May be tricked by slightly different URLs (like ?param1=va)
[07:57:33] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/o9ss3j9b/ "Tour is not defined".  Huh? http://bootstraptour.com/ The docs lie. What do?
[07:59:06] <sadtaco> nvm..
[07:59:58] <shoky> rindolf: i didn't understand your question, what are you trying to do
[08:00:19] <sadtaco> Wow i'm dumb
[08:01:00] <rindolf> shoky: like: for (var i = 1 ; i <= 32000; i++) { {Perform AJAX query related to i and wait for it to finish and return.} }
[08:02:00] <shoky> rindolf you won't have too deep a stack recursion if you call the "outer" function from inside an ajax callback
[08:02:18] <shoky> ajax callbacks, setTimeouts, etc  create a new stack
[08:02:28] <rindolf> shoky: ah, OK.
[08:02:33] <shoky> didn't understand what jQuery.get has to do with it ;p
[08:03:04] <rindolf> shoky: I want to use it to retrieve the data.
[08:03:12] <rindolf> And it uses a callback.
[08:03:30] <shoky> ohh sorry confusd it with $(..).get()
[08:05:09] <shoky> rindolf you may also wanna check out  https://github.com/gnarf/jquery-ajaxQueue
[08:09:51] <rindolf> shoky: thanks! Much appreciated.
[08:27:53] <ukfdub> can jquery be used to connect to a dbase
[08:29:53] <Mr21> ukfdub: hmm not a "connection", you can make some request in ajax only
[08:31:07] <ukfdub> whats the easiest way in ajax to load up an html/css page / div section saying get rid of 1 page, load another, or get rid of specific things, load new things
[08:50:03] <DarkChaoz> im trying to do a foreach child element count and get an element within that child.. for every intial element
[08:50:13] <DarkChaoz> can someone check if this is correct http://pastebin.com/tzKcmmVh
[08:54:34] <Mr21> ukfdub: do you have an concret example? normally the AJAX is for manipulating some data. Not for the design (html/css)
[08:55:49] <Mr21> DarkChaoz: your pastebin it's not clear not indented
[08:57:48] <Mr21> DarkChaoz: your $(i) is non-sens :/ all your lines could be shortened, what do you want to do exactly
[09:08:59] <DarkChaoz> sorry m21 i was afk
[09:09:24] <DarkChaoz> $(i) suppose to be like 0,1,2,3 because i have multiple xml elements of Skill
[09:09:37] <DarkChaoz> tryna loop it so it gets each one
[09:16:27] <Mr21> DarkChaoz: the methode who looks like of 0,1,2,3,... is .eq(), like: var jq_div = $("div"); jq_div.eq(0); // first div
[09:17:56] <Mr21> DarkChaoz: you have to many each everywhere. Made your selection in the $("...") and after use the .each methode.
[09:18:25] <DarkChaoz> i thought about doing that could be easier..
[09:18:43] <Mr21> DarkChaoz: like $(".skill").each(function(), { $(this)... })
[09:19:51] <Mr21> DarkChaoz: you dont need to rewrite some foreach loop by yourself. You have $("").each(function) or $.each(array, function)
[09:20:35] <DarkChaoz> yeah i did that before then switched to foreach
[09:20:43] <DarkChaoz> didnt know which one to use
[09:20:47] <DarkChaoz> thanks
[09:23:58] <Mr21> DarkChaoz: no problem :)
[09:34:39] <moo> whats the .live( parent, class, callback )  best practices now? i cant bind the actual item because it goes away n is re-appended sometimes
[09:35:16] <decx> live is dead
[09:35:31] <decx> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[09:36:04] <moo> ty much
[09:41:23] <MarkProffitt> I switched the class of an element but it still acts like the previous class.  How do I change it to function like the new class?
[09:42:58] <Uhkis> ?demo @ MarkProffitt
[09:43:02] <Uhkis> oh right
[09:43:03] <Uhkis> ?demo
[09:43:04] <b-ot> Uhkis: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:43:07] <Uhkis> MarkProffitt: ^
[09:48:52] <decx> if you want an element to do different things based on state then use data()
[09:54:20] <moo> Mark: maybe you have to unbind your event handlers if its still reacting to events bound to the old class --- .unbind('click') etc? idk if ur talking about events tho without an example
[09:55:04] <decx> having two handlers for one elements is ridiculous
[09:55:16] <decx> one handler, logic in there
[09:56:10] <moo> ^ good advice
[10:14:31] <Uhkis> decx: you mean for one event, right?
[10:15:34] <decx> yes?
[10:15:56] <Uhkis> well you said element, not event ;)
[10:16:42] <decx> i meant element not event
[10:18:21] <Uhkis> lets just say you meant one event per element
[10:19:03] <decx> not at all what i meant ^^
[10:21:41] <Uhkis> one handler per x events per x elements :D
[10:21:45] <Uhkis> are we there now? :D
[10:22:03] <decx> no idea the dude with the problem never came back to clarify ;DD
[10:25:48] <Uhkis> :)
[11:24:41] <uskerine> hi, I have a <div class="tab-pane"> in bootstrap and I want to include content inside, do I have to add another <div>? I have added just an <img> but it is not automatically scaled
[11:33:06] <wenqin> why does jquery return a value for the children of a <a> tag (e.g $('a').children()) gives a value which throws off my code
[11:33:47] <arc_> can you rephrase that
[11:34:27] <wenqin> How come $('a').children() returns a value? shouldn't it be nil since links will never have children?
[11:34:52] <arc_> what does it return
[11:35:36] <Uhkis> it returns a jquery object
[11:35:41] <wenqin> [prevObject: n.fn.init[1], context: a.nav-block.dropdown-toggle.log-in-block, jquery: "2.1.4", constructor: function, selector: ""…]
[11:37:22] <wenqin> actually sorry, it prints nothing
[11:37:42] <shoky> <a> can have children
[11:38:37] <wenqin> how can I check if <a> has children or not? $('a').children === null does not work
[11:38:38] <shoky> anyways check .children().length
[11:38:49] <shoky> children().length === 0
[11:39:00] <wenqin> oh ok
[11:52:07] <moo> uskerine: try adding .img-responsive class to the img (depending on the bootstrap ver)  http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_css_images.asp
[11:52:43] <uskerine> thanks moo
[11:52:52] <uskerine> I finally managed to get it responsive using that
[11:53:02] <moo> :)
[11:53:07] <uskerine> I also was terminating the <img> with />
[11:53:50] <moo> that should be ok :d
[11:54:18] <uskerine> uhm
[11:54:38] <uskerine> I am mixing it with a map plugin which seems to mess with img-responsive
[11:56:19] <moo> how so
[11:56:33] <moo> i did end up tweaking my img classes with bootstrap a lot
[11:59:33] <uskerine> I think that I will have to detect the change by myself and force a img resize
[12:00:26] <uskerine> does anyone know how to detect when a certain tab is selected/shown in bootstrap3? I've tried this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8136904/twitter-bootstrap-tabs-and-javascript-events without success, same for other google entries:
[12:04:07] <doug16k__> this channel is working right? my log has a huge gap starting at 9:23
[12:08:43] <uskerine> is there any event to detect when a div changes its width?
[12:10:35] <Uhkis> your width changing function ;-)
[12:10:55] <uskerine> ??
[12:11:08] <uskerine> Uhkis, please elaborate
[12:11:43] <moo> no your best bet is to wrap it in a div, put position:relative on that div and the parent div, and then width:100%,height:100% on the img
[12:11:48] <moo> i think
[12:11:50] <moo> i think
[12:11:54] <Uhkis> if you change width of an element, do somethimg
[12:11:55] <moo> oop
[12:13:00] <uskerine> Uhkis, that's what I am trying to detect, the change of a width in an element, it is not me the one who is initiating that
[12:13:16] <nbt> uskerine: so how does the width of the div get changed?
[12:13:27] <uskerine> the tablet is rotated
[12:13:31] <uskerine> the menu is collapsed
[12:13:40] <uskerine> the size of the browser changes
[12:13:47] <Uhkis> then the plugin should give the event
[12:14:25] <moo> $(window).on('resize', function (e) { ... })
[12:14:37] <moo> or window.screen i forget
[12:14:39] <Uhkis> theres orientationchange but its unreliable
[12:14:47] <moo> one is viewport one is browser
[12:14:59] <moo> oh nvm
[12:15:08] <moo> link to code?
[12:15:43] <uskerine> thanks moo, I'll try, the problem is that I am using a "non bootstrap-ready" map area plugin which breaks img-responsive
[12:16:22] <uskerine> so I have to detect when container div changes so I can resize the image "manually"
[12:16:35] <moo> just add the img-responsive class to the map parent div
[12:16:46] <moo> oh nvm it probably works off the img tag hmm
[12:17:00] <moo> might work tho
[12:17:05] <uskerine> I will try
[12:17:11] <uskerine> what nvm and hmm means?
[12:17:44] <moo> nvm:nevermind, hmm is like "thinking.."
[12:17:55] <uskerine> ok
[12:25:08] <moo> it looks like bootstrap img responsive just sets max-width 100% and height auto
[12:25:25] <moo> so if the parent div height is crazy or too big... your thing will break
[12:25:35] <moo> maybe set max-height on the parent div
[12:31:07] <moo> http://www.bootply.com/TNsIY42jSJ seems to work for me x=
[12:33:50] <moo> uskerine: you might just need max-width / max-height or min-width on the parent div, cheers
[12:33:57] <uskerine> moo, I am using mapster
[12:34:26] <uskerine> http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/default.aspx?docs.html
[12:38:04] <Stalkr_> I'm trying to replace a div with images. Is it possible to listen for when all images (I downloading 12) are done loading and inserted to the page?
[12:38:07] <Stalkr_> $('.photos').load(//) doesn't work for me
[12:39:27] <uskerine> Stalkr_,  you say load does not work
[12:39:37] <uskerine> did you add the function handler?
[12:40:30] <uskerine>  $('.photos').load('file.html', function() { this executes once html with img have been loaded } );
[12:40:46] <Stalkr_> uskerine: I'm using _ for templating and I have this http://git.io/vTfhI where self.photos == $('.photos')
[12:41:12] <uskerine> moo I will try that about max-width / min-width
[12:41:44] <uskerine> I don't know what self-photos is
[12:42:01] <uskerine> is that a plugin?
[12:42:07] <Stalkr_> uskerine: That's just $('.photos;)
[12:42:14] <Stalkr_> $('.photos')
[12:42:30] <uskerine> and what templates does?
[12:43:10] <uskerine> load requires that you specify a html file to be loaded in the div element
[12:45:05] <moo> uskerine: yea idk it uses a bunch of nested canvas elements
[12:45:11] <moo> it might not be possible
[12:45:17] <kevireilly> stalkr_: `self` is probably a reference to another `this` context
[12:45:39] <Stalkr_> kevireilly: Yep
[12:45:46] <jewetnit> Stalkr_: you can try using a library like async or just use a counter total = $(selector).length, loaded = 0, increment loaded by one every time one loads, when it equals the total (-1) they're all loaded
[12:45:52] <moo> uskerine: http://jsfiddle.net/nLazaxcw/1/ thats the closest i can get
[12:46:24] <moo> Stalkr_: you might wanna check out imagesLoaded plugin by i think dsandro, most ppl use that
[12:46:32] <uskerine> wow, thanks for giving it a try moo, let me check the fiddle
[12:47:52] <Stalkr_> moo: cool, I'll check that one out
[12:51:15] <moo> uskerine: http://jsfiddle.net/jamietre/jQG48/ this and monitoring the bootstrap tab clicks combined should be enough ;>
[12:51:20] <moo> gtg, gl
[12:52:48] <uskerine> thanks a lot moo, still checking your fiddles
[12:53:49] <uskerine> I will double check but I think the problem with your approach is that the div might change its width without a window resize event being raised
[12:53:56] <uskerine> think about left menu collapsed/expanded
[12:54:05] <uskerine> that changes the div width without having a window.resize event
[12:54:42] <uskerine> anyway I will double check everything carefully, thanks a lot for the help moo
[13:10:37] <wallet> Hi
[13:12:21] <wallet> Does anyone know why I can't access my global page variables in script tags for content that is loaded using AJAX?
[13:17:16] <kevireilly> wallet: can you possibly produce a simplified jsfiddle of the issue?
[13:17:31] <wallet> I can try..
[13:17:38] <wallet> It's kind've a big project :\
[13:17:50] <wallet> Trying to get it released open source.
[13:18:09] <wallet> I think it's because I shouldn't be injecting JS from the page I'm loading
[13:18:22] <wallet> I guess I might just have to strip the script tags..
[13:19:25] <kevireilly> hmm yeah generally doesn’t sound like a great idea from the perspective of security and arbitrary code execution
[13:21:11] <kevireilly> but i’m probably wrong and its probably common place
[13:21:52] <wallet> hmmm
[13:23:02] <wallet> Hmm I think I found a solution :D
[13:23:28] <wallet> Anyone here use gulp.js?
[13:25:49] <BillCriswell> wallet: I do for some things.
[13:54:13] <huck5> Hi. Can someone point out why my event isn't being triggered? https://gist.github.com/Huck5/06cbe43bf0fb26d7aec3
[13:55:11] <huck5> I pinpoint my anchor by its Id. And use $('#theId').on('click', function() { console.log("functionCalled"); });. Yet the log line is never called..
[14:03:29] <Jattenalle> huck5, need to see more of the code, for all we know it might be a duplicate element id
[14:03:49] <Jattenalle> the code as seen in that git runs just fine
[14:04:52] <BillCriswell> If you have the script in the head you need to wait for the document ready.
[14:05:17] <BillCriswell> If you're dynamically loading that HTML you'll need to use event delegation.
[14:06:39] <huck5> Jattenalle, I figured out what was going on. Rendering partials via Ajax, and the href needed unique id
[14:06:50] <huck5> Jattenalle, exactly what you said :)
[14:06:57] <Jattenalle> nice
[14:07:14] <Jattenalle> .. and i only said it to be silly as well :P
[14:07:14] <huck5> BillCriswell, could you elaborate on 'event delegation' ?
[14:07:17] <Jattenalle> sometimes it's the simple stuff
[14:08:03] <BillCriswell> huck5: You'd need to wait for the event on a parent that's always there then see if the element that triggered that event is the one you want.
[14:08:34] <BillCriswell> The most extreme example would be $(document).on('click', '#someid', function () { });
[14:09:09] <Uhkis> in code: $('element-thats-always-there').on('event', 'element-that-will-be-there', function(){});
[14:09:32] <BillCriswell> Much clearer.
[14:09:58] <huck5> Ah
[14:10:02] <huck5> That makes sense
[14:10:21] <huck5> If i put the script in a partial, will it be able to see Id's of elements in the parent-page?
[14:10:36] <huck5> Trying would be the best thing to do.
[14:11:27] <Jattenalle> if you want to use multiple elements with the same id, which you shouldnt, but if you really want to
[14:11:51] <Jattenalle> you can do something along the lines of $(unique_parent).find(some id).click
[14:12:09] <Jattenalle> or: $('#unique_parent #someid').click
[14:12:24] <Jattenalle> it will work, but yeah, duplicate id's is bad
[14:12:28] <huck5> Hm.. I'm currently generating random post-fixes for the id's, for each row (partial rendered)
[14:12:32] <huck5> which seems to work.
[14:12:47] <Jattenalle> better solution would be to just have a class for all your "Delete/Remove" elements
[14:12:49] <huck5> Could you glance at this again https://gist.github.com/Huck5/06cbe43bf0fb26d7aec3 ? I updated the script to reflect what I'm actually trying to do (which is obviously more than just log a line in console).
[14:12:56] <Jattenalle> and use the data passed by the click event
[14:13:04] <huck5> Actually, holdon. I'll add the whole page-code.
[14:13:33] <wallet> Is gulp supposed to run tasks with watch if you haven't saved the file?
[14:13:54] <huck5> What I'm trying to do is remove the deleted-partial from the parent page... https://gist.github.com/Huck5/06cbe43bf0fb26d7aec3
[14:14:16] <Jattenalle> i would do something along the lines of: $('.col-md-12 .deleteRow').on('click', function(e){ /* do stuff on $(e) */ });
[14:14:35] <huck5> e would be the partial-page in that context?
[14:14:39] <huck5> context = example*
[14:15:14] <huck5> I guess what I mean is, could I jsut just do $(e).remove() ?
[14:15:28] <Jattenalle> $(e).parent().remove() i guess
[14:15:42] <Jattenalle> or parent.parent if that's what you want
[14:15:54] <huck5> thanks!
[14:18:13] <huck5> in the current code I have (which, admittedly, I copied from an example), there is $(this).parents(...).remove();. What does "parents()" mean?
[14:18:20] <huck5> Why would it be pluralized?
[14:19:52] <huck5> A follow-up question on that, the parameter in parents("div.editorRow:first") .. that would be searching in the parent for a div containing a class 'editorRow'?
[14:21:37] <Jattenalle> https://api.jquery.com/parents/
[14:21:49] <huck5> Ty
[14:22:16] <Jattenalle> usually you dont want parents, since you'll need to filter it anyhow, better to directly get what you're after from the start.. but it doesnt really matter much
[14:23:16] <huck5> Jattenalle, well, best-practice is good to follow. But.. this is more of a proof-of-concept hackjob at this stage :/
[14:27:04] <huck5> If I have $('#uniqueId').on("click", function(e) { $(e).remove(); }); ... shouldn't that delete the Anchor with the the unique id?
[14:27:56] <doug16k__> huck5, definitely not
[14:27:59] <huck5> Oh
[14:28:12] <doug16k__> the event object is not an element. you proably meant $(e.target).remove(); }
[14:28:20] <huck5> thank you!
[14:28:42] <huck5> Beautiful
[14:29:04] <doug16k__> or in that case, $(this).remove() also works. I prefer target because it continues to work with event delegation
[14:29:17] <doug16k__> it may or may not be better, in all cases
[14:29:33] <doug16k__> if it is something with descendents, extra care is needed
[14:30:28] <huck5> It did what I expected. But the higher-level task I hoped it would accomplish failed..
[14:30:40] <huck5> But thank you nonetheless!
[14:30:59] <doug16k__> :)
[14:33:09] <huck5> Any experience adding to/removing from a nested model collection, in ASP Entity Framework? lol
[14:34:17] <doug16k__> sorry I mostly avoid vendor-lock platforms
[14:34:41] <doug16k__> or try to anyway
[14:35:24] <huck5> yeah. Seems like an excellent idea. Been giving me nothing but trouble for days now
[14:37:27] <lambdumb> say i have a function that's run multiple times, and that function has its own sub functions
[14:37:59] <lambdumb> am i wasting memory by re-declaring those sub functions (like function myfunction(). etc)? should i declare subfunctions at a global level once?
[14:57:00] <BillCriswell> drej: Assuming Safari (in-app) would mean like through facebooks little webkit thing in the app?
[14:57:11] <BillCriswell> oops, wrong channel.
[14:59:53] <lambdumb> oh, here's a question
[15:00:20] <lambdumb> so say i do something like $('#div').html(--myvar) where myvar is a number
[15:00:39] <lambdumb> does myvar get redefined with the operator in there?
[15:01:04] <lambdumb> so say i did $('#div').html(--myvar) and myvar is 3, after running that operation, would myvar be 2?
[15:01:34] <BillCriswell> lambdumb: You want to read up on post and pre increment.
[15:03:13] <BillCriswell> myvar = 3; --myvar would return 2 where myvar-- would return 3, but then myvar would be 2.
[15:04:59] <lambdumb> if i increment the variable and use it as an argument to a method is it still incremented?
[15:05:36] <lambdumb> cause i'm incrementing it in the method like .html(--myvar) but would it still be decremented after the .html() method
[15:21:10] <BillCriswell> lambdumb: Yes. If yu do that outside of the html() call you can just use myvar again.
[15:21:36] <lambdumb> oh, cool
[15:21:38] <lambdumb> thank you
[15:22:56] <BillCriswell> Welcome1
[16:55:25] <bepolite> arthurvr: Hey
[16:55:28] <bepolite> Got a sec?
[20:12:27] <pauled> very nice site :) -> http://www.codecademy.com
[20:12:54] <pauled> I am currently learning the basics of JS
[20:56:34] <pauled> getting trouble with the exercise 8/13 of JS
[20:57:08] <pauled> http://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-6LzGd/1/3
[21:00:21] <pauled> here is my result: http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/6z78ztp6/
[21:01:05] <pauled> it should be 'true' but it return 'false'
[21:04:49] <pauled> nvm, it's solved
[21:10:55] <huck5> How can I call a Button/Anchor's onClick method, from another function?
[21:57:10] <JBlitzen> .click()
[21:57:18] <JBlitzen> huck5 ^
[21:57:30] <huck5> oh hey, sorry.
[21:57:36] <huck5> I want afk.
[21:58:09] <huck5> I have a new question now.  In an anchor's on(click) method I pass the ev.target.herf to another function. https://gist.github.com/Huck5/50733cab188209ccafe6#file-script-js-L9 How can I get the same URL in a $(document).ready() function?
[22:00:03] <huck5> JBlitzen, if you are still around ^ :)
[22:00:58] <JBlitzen> .attr("href"), I believe
[22:01:23] <JBlitzen> Assuming it can't be passed through the calling chain or stored in an object variable or something
[22:03:12] <huck5> JBlitzen, Ok, thank you :)
[22:03:46] <JBlitzen> yw
[22:26:47] <tuskkk___> how do I use the token to create the charge with a server-side script, http://jsfiddle.net/9r37ozt3/
[22:32:21] <pauled> your jsfiddle is not correctly set. http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/9r37ozt3/1/
[22:34:57] <pauled> tuskkk___: http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/9r37ozt3/2/
[22:36:14] <tuskkk___> pauled: but how do I create the charge server side?
[22:36:47] <pauled> I don't know ^^ I am noob here
[22:40:20] <pauled> tuskkk___: duckduckgo is your friend ^^ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22445078/how-to-create-a-stripe-charge-with-a-checkout-token-sent-via-ajax-to-php
[22:43:13] <tuskkk___> pauled: all these examples have some server side thing involved, can't we achieve this using just js?
[22:43:49] <pauled> maybe here ? https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js https://stripe.com/docs/tutorials/charges
[22:44:28] <tuskkk___> been there already
[22:52:15] <pauled> tuskkk___: look like it's serverside script only
[22:55:58] <Woet> tuskkk___: no, you can't charge creditcards client-side
[22:56:03] <Woet> that'd be rather insecure
[22:56:42] <pauled> here is with php https://stripe.com/docs/api/php#create_charge
[22:57:08] <tuskkk___> Woet: Ok, the client is using squarespace, that only allows us to inject js, now I told him we could deploy an heroic instanace and take care of payments there, but they are adamant and want it with js only
[22:57:17] <tuskkk___> I have no idea how to explain this to them
[22:57:36] <tuskkk___> heroku*
[23:00:27] <pauled> Node.js?
[23:00:44] <pauled> it's serverside
[23:01:01] <pauled> and it's javascript too ^^
[23:01:29] <tuskkk___> yea, searching how to handle a form post in it
[23:02:14] <tuskkk___> but then I doubt we can inset it in squarespace platform
[23:50:25] <zoople> hey all, whats the preferred method of requesting help? psatebin?
[23:50:30] <zoople> *pastebin?
[23:53:36] <zoople> i have a question regarding a very simple example I can't get working involving nodeJS and JQuery
[23:53:50] <pauled> jsfiddle is a nice start
[23:54:24] <zoople> ok, ill see what my code looks like in that
[23:54:26] <zoople> thanks
[23:56:26] <zoople> not sure  if it will work coz im using nodejs...but here goes: https://jsfiddle.net/gen4z4Lz/
[23:57:02] <zoople> just trying to do a basic get request. the nodejs console receives the request but for some reason, the jquery get doesn't get the response
[23:59:00] <zoople> i THINK it may be due to the same origin policy...i'm just loading display.html in a browser and it's making GET request on localhost
[23:59:05] <zoople> am I on the right track?
