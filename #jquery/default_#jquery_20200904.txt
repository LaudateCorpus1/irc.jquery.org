[11:24:32] <inthl> instead of using e.g. alert(), is there some way to trigger that browser's question to the user about dirty forms aka unsaved content? I have a custom implementation of some ajax stuff and would like to trigger this system function instead of making something up with alert()
[21:04:47] <physikoi> Hi #jquery. I have a situation where I'm receiving a json response and I'd like to append the text values within to certain elements on the page. I know how to do that. But, is there a better way than doing `$(".user_id", "#table").text(data.user_id); $(".username", "#table").text(data.username);` etc?
[21:05:08] <physikoi> I guess i'm wondering if there's something more efficient.
[21:05:42] <robertmaxrees> guessing it's not an array but just a straight up object?
[21:06:48] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: yeah, that's right.
[21:07:12] <robertmaxrees> a few different ways.  could Object.keys(data).forEach() it
[21:07:50] <physikoi> Hm yeah, and just make sure the ids and keys have the same spellings
[21:08:26] <robertmaxrees> or just use classes :)

[21:08:43] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[21:09:32] <physikoi> nice. even better :)
[21:09:36] <physikoi> thanks i'm trying now
[21:11:52] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: wow, very slick. Thanks
[21:14:23] <robertmaxrees> def.
[21:14:38] <robertmaxrees> there are other ways to do that via an array that would be a little more elegant.
[21:15:31] <robertmaxrees> but that depends on if you want to make that change haha
