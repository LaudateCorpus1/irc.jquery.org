[00:21:53] <doug65536> tieTYT: simple way is to do this: $('...bagslot-selector...').not('.hasclick').addClass('hasclick').on('click', clickhandler);
[00:22:14] <doug65536> tieTYT: although I still recommend putting one click handler on the parent element of all the bag slots
[00:23:05] <tieTYT> do you recommend that first way on everything I add click handlers to?
[00:23:40] <doug65536> tieTYT: it would be a simple way to avoid duplicate click handlers
[00:23:59] <tieTYT> hrm yeah I could do that
[00:24:11] <tieTYT> ok thanks for the advice
[00:24:26] <tieTYT> do you know of any blog articles that explain how I should have set this up in the first place?
[00:24:37] <ph88> that's not nice to use styling to detect if something has a click handler
[00:27:47] <doug65536> $('...').not('[data-hasclick="1"]').data('hasclick','1').on('click', clickhandler) is "nicer"
[00:29:45] <doug65536> ph88: what's wrong with using class to assign a purpose to things?
[01:03:27] <ekkis> anyone around? would you expect .find("tr.main td:eq(2)") to return multiple tds?
[01:03:31] <ekkis> or just one?
[01:03:43] <ekkis> I'd expect multiple but I'm getting just one
[01:03:50] <codepodu> just one
[01:03:57] <codepodu> eq(2) does that
[01:04:04] <ekkis> is there an eq-child()?
[01:04:08] <ekkis> or some such thing?
[01:04:09] <codepodu> but if you have multiple tr.main, you'll get multiple
[01:04:16] <codepodu> what are you looking to do
[01:04:23] <ekkis> I have multiple tr.main but I'm only getting back 1
[01:04:46] <HD|Laptop> Hey all
[01:04:51] <ekkis> so I understand that if I do .find("tr.main td:first") that I'll get only one
[01:05:04] <ekkis> I have to do .find("tr.main td:first-child") to get many
[01:05:08] <HD|Laptop> I run a ajax request with $.json(...).always(function f(xhr) {});
[01:05:19] <ekkis> but with .eq() there isn't a .eq-child() - is there?
[01:05:25] <HD|Laptop> can I "pass" something from outside into the xhr-object?
[01:06:13] * ekkis hasn't played with $.json
[01:06:42] <HD|Laptop> it's the same as .ajax
[01:07:51] <ekkis> so why not use $.ajax?
[01:09:26] <HD|Laptop> because .json does validating for me
[01:09:37] <HD|Laptop> and automatically gives a json object to the done function
[01:09:43] <HD|Laptop> but anyways I found out its possible
[01:10:02] <ekkis> hmm? I get a json object in the success function of an $.ajax call too...
[01:10:09] <ekkis> I don't know what validation it does for you
[01:10:12] <HD|Laptop> the done-function gets 3 arguments a,b,c , where c is the request-object
[01:11:19] <boytoy_> Hello guys.
[01:11:34] <boytoy_> At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/33/edit (using jQuery Embedly), how do I only embed videos from YouTube and Vimeo, and not random media from random URLs? Can I use the Services API (http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/service)?
[01:18:39] <HD|Laptop> When I abort a Deferred request with .abort(), can I then give a function which is called when all always-handlers have been run?
[01:24:24] <ekkis> codepodu: got it.  you can do it with nth-child() - yea!
[02:41:26] <ert3go> Hello,can anyone point out where am I going wrong here : http://jsfiddle.net/yMdyp/
[02:53:05] <ph88> ert3go: what do you want to do ?
[03:01:09] <ert3go> ph88, pass the value selected in dropdown via ajax to the server
[03:49:55] <ert3go> So I can execute my code on jsfiddle but it doesn't work when I try it locally..can anyone point out why does this happen?
[04:55:34] <Bish> hi can anyone tell me how facebook (a.e https://www.facebook.com/me/friends_all) switch pages without really switching pages and how to detect those page changes? i tried onpopstate of the history html5 api, but that didn't work for me, please help!
[05:05:44] <Asmooh> do i always need document.ready before a load. ?
[05:05:57] <Asmooh> i notice it doesnt load the photos until refresh
[05:06:21] <Bish> Asmooh, what exactly are you talking about
[05:06:38] <Asmooh> i have: $('#explore').load(url, function() {
[05:06:38] <Asmooh> });
[05:06:44] <Asmooh> without a document.ready before it
[05:06:56] <Asmooh> when i refresh the page in chome, it loads, otherwise it doesnty
[05:06:59] <Asmooh> -y
[05:07:12] <Bish> what is "otherwise" without document ready?
[05:07:37] <Asmooh> no, when i just click on the link, i get white screen with no photos
[05:07:41] <Asmooh> when i refresh i do
[05:08:02] <Bish> im not understanding your problem by your description do you have a link?
[05:08:30] <Asmooh> notice
[05:08:52] <Asmooh> wait, click opn home first
[05:09:02] <Asmooh> than on the 4 squares
[05:09:05] <Asmooh> on*
[05:09:23] <Asmooh> so from there
[05:09:38] <Bish> i can see pictures, but what is the problem?
[05:09:54] <Asmooh> well when you start from the home / index.html
[05:09:56] <Asmooh> it doesnt show
[05:10:02] <Asmooh> only when i refresh one time
[05:10:23] <stratoss> Asmooh: it could be an browser cache problem. Have you tried to clear your cache?
[05:10:58] <Asmooh> yeah
[05:11:04] <Asmooh> but i also have it in my app
[05:12:16] <stratoss> can you give me the url?
[05:12:44] <Asmooh> click on the 4 squares
[05:13:19] <Bish> ahh no i get your problem
[05:13:40] <Bish> well doo
[05:15:51] <Asmooh> or can the issue be my data-prefetch?
[05:18:51] <Bish> frist think i would try is the document ready stuff
[05:18:53] <Bish> thing*
[05:19:36] <Asmooh> okay :)
[05:19:59] <Bish> since the function does not seem to get executed at all when going via link. also why are you using ajax anyways? it looks like you're just using it to load content, but you switch pages
[05:20:38] <Asmooh> because the content is on a remote server
[05:20:44] <Bish> i c
[05:22:54] <Asmooh> sometimes it does work, sometimes not
[05:22:59] <Asmooh> depending on the page i was before
[05:23:06] <Asmooh> but let me try with now :)
[05:23:36] <Asmooh> nah not really :P
[05:25:06] <Asmooh> i will also try to see if i really need a second div
[05:25:11] <Asmooh> i should be able to load it in content
[05:26:43] <Asmooh> you can F5 the link Bish
[05:26:48] <Asmooh> doesnt work :)
[05:27:03] <Asmooh> in the current version of the app on bb and android i use a re-direct first
[05:27:14] <Asmooh> downside is that you get to much white flashes in the app
[05:35:16] <hooligan132> hey can I asked you lower level jquery developers a big favor.. please fork jplayer fix it and make it directly part of jquerys frame work so it can be good light weight, minimal and fast.. and make sure that it supports bug free shoutcast streaming from the out set plleaeeeeasse prity pse!!!!!
[05:36:15] <mdev> why isn't this work http://pastebin.com/YWXAErWL
[05:36:34] <hooligan132> the only place you can even find support for jplayer is on google groups and its like days before your request for help even gets moderated
[05:36:53] <beatnyk> could someone please help me figure out why these objects aren't collapsing, instead they render open when they should be collapsed... example page: http://uploadwire.com/download/303/ULTIMATE%20Candy%20Crush%20Secrets.pdf
[05:37:14] <beatnyk> cant figure it out for the life of me
[05:37:20] <Asmooh> candy crush secrets :D
[05:37:22] <Bish> hooligan132, you should just throw money at it
[05:38:19] <hooligan132> I would if i could ... how much money you thinking? ...but there are perfectly good html5 audio/webaudio apis that should be able do the task from what I understand
[05:39:27] <hooligan132> I refuse to use a flash solution.. and Firefox even has mp3 support now afaik
[05:39:41] <hooligan132> theres simply no excuse
[05:58:00] <beatnyk> would someone mind telling me why these containers aren't collapsed on page load when they should be? http://uploadwire.com/download/305/LegitCodes.zip
[05:58:14] <beatnyk> namely the 'help' container
[05:58:23] <beatnyk> i think it's a jquery conflict but im not sure
[05:59:15] <Asmooh> strange, my swipe down menu doesnt work
[05:59:18] <Asmooh> -_-
[05:59:23] <doug65536> beatnyk: $ is not defined
[06:00:34] <beatnyk> doug65536 are you talking about $(document).ready(function(){
[06:00:41] <doug65536> yes
[06:00:56] <beatnyk> i dont understand how is it not defined?
[06:01:19] <doug65536> easy. $ = undefined after you do $(document).ready(function() { ...
[06:01:41] <doug65536> how it got undefined is the question
[06:01:46] <doug65536> other libraries do use $ though
[06:02:05] <doug65536> jQuery is not defined either
[06:02:38] <beatnyk> oO what the heck
[06:03:05] <beatnyk> i can't wrap my dumb brain around that
[06:03:22] <beatnyk> i have this in src <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.js"></script>
[06:03:54] <doug65536> it's not something stupid... as far as I can tell so far
[06:04:01] <beatnyk> ok
[06:04:15] <beatnyk> man if you figure this out you're a god in my book, ive been at it for hours
[06:04:49] <doug65536> I don't see jquery loaded in LegitCodes.zip
[06:04:58] <doug65536> you have init.js before jquery
[06:05:22] <beatnyk> does the placement of the src="jquery.js" matter?
[06:05:25] <beatnyk> i didnt know it did
[06:05:31] <doug65536> yes it matters very much
[06:05:37] <beatnyk> so i should place that first
[06:05:41] <doug65536> yes
[06:05:41] <beatnyk> and see what happens
[06:05:43] <beatnyk> alrighty
[06:06:08] <doug65536> why do you have jquery-1.8.3.min.js then jquery.js
[06:06:32] <doug65536> jquery.js is ancient! do you need that one?
[06:07:12] <Bish> hi can anyone tell me how facebook (a.e https://www.facebook.com/me/friends_all) switch pages without really switching pages and how to detect those page changes? i tried onpopstate of the history html5 api, but that didn't work for me, please help!
[06:07:52] <beatnyk> not sure, ill see if removing it helps
[06:08:09] <doug65536> Bish: onpopstate didn't work because you probably did it wrong.
[06:08:29] <doug65536> Bish: like I did when I first tried it
[06:09:39] <doug65536> Bish: you push an initial state, then when you go to something, you push the new state, then go to that state. when you get onpopstate, you get the thing BEFORE the last thing you pushed
[06:10:18] <doug65536> Bish: you don't push the old state then go. you push a state that represents where you are going to go
[06:11:12] <doug65536> beatnyk: did you upload the changes?
[06:11:28] <beatnyk> doug65536: yes sir
[06:11:40] <beatnyk> ditched jquery.js and put everything in correct ascending order
[06:11:51] <beatnyk> to no avail unfortunately =(
[06:12:08] <beatnyk> wait init.js is still on top
[06:12:49] <beatnyk> still no avail, darn
[06:13:22] <beatnyk> the 'help' and 'report file' containers should be collapsed...in a perfect world
[06:13:51] <doug65536> beatnyk: bxSlider is not loaded, so your document.ready crashes immediately
[06:14:25] <beatnyk> ok
[06:15:39] <beatnyk> it is loaded now
[06:15:51] <beatnyk> still no collapse =(
[06:16:00] <beatnyk> i feel we're getting closer though
[06:16:18] <doug65536> fancybox is not loaded. crashes there
[06:16:45] <ruby_on_tails> how can i clone an element right above(higher z-index) the original ?
[06:16:50] <beatnyk> ok
[06:16:52] <beatnyk> sec
[06:17:31] <anew> damnit guys i'm trying to replicate the last answer here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7109362/how-to-replicate-pinterest-coms-absolute-div-stacking-layout
[06:17:33] <anew> totally lost tho
[06:17:56] <beatnyk> doug65536, i think i got em all loaded now, but still no collapse unfortunately
[06:18:36] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: which part?
[06:18:54] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: which part of what ?
[06:19:03] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: which part is a problem
[06:19:12] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: i have a div, i want to place a transparent version of it above it
[06:20:30] <ruby_on_tails> i have successfully cloned the element and placed it .after() the original
[06:20:41] <ruby_on_tails> now the problem is positioning it exactly above the original
[06:21:09] <ruby_on_tails> just trying to figure out a way which will be robust for scenarios like resize, scroll, overflow, absolute positioning
[06:21:34] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: ok, that's what I was asking. use .offset() to get the offset from the nearest positioned parent, and use .css(original.offset()).css({position: 'absolute'}) to place it
[06:22:10] <doug65536> oops
[06:22:15] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: what happens when i scroll ? it will break i guess
[06:22:17] <doug65536> sorry I mean, use .position(), not offset()
[06:22:25] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: no, absolute doesn't mean fixed
[06:22:31] <ruby_on_tails> oh
[06:22:32] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[06:22:41] <ruby_on_tails> sounds good
[06:22:43] <ruby_on_tails> trying
[06:26:27] <Hi_Everyone> if someone could point me in the right direction, hopefully this has been done before. on click hold and drag, I need to create a box that selects all elements the box has inside.
[06:27:17] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/U7tKM/
[06:28:54] <beatnyk> doug65536, any other ideas or?
[06:29:04] <beatnyk> got all the libs loaded
[06:29:19] <doug65536> beatnyk: something funny happens...
[06:29:38] <doug65536> beatnyk: and I'm not laughin'
[06:29:54] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/U7tKM/2/ this is the problem i am facing
[06:30:16] <ruby_on_tails> i guess appending to the body will work better in here, using .offset instead of .position
[06:30:18] <ruby_on_tails> ?
[06:30:25] <beatnyk> doug65536, im crying
[06:30:27] <beatnyk> lol
[06:31:18] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: that's more likely to do the wrong thing in some scenarios though
[06:31:30] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: any better solution ?
[06:32:38] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: ah, I see what's happening... yes I have a brute-force way to fix that
[06:34:25] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: one moment
[06:38:39] <Zak> is there another generic channel for web development?
[06:39:27] <Zak> i found one, but if anybody has any suggestions, please send 'em through
[06:41:13] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: closer http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/U7tKM/4/
[06:41:19] <_rgn> Zak: which channel did you find
[06:41:54] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: thanks http://jsfiddle.net/U7tKM/5/
[06:42:20] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: good idea :)
[06:42:38] <ruby_on_tails> :)
[06:42:39] <fl0w> I have a nested array (like so: var data = [['some value', 'some value 2], ['some value 3', 'some value 3']]), and I'd like to create a select element with appropriate option elements dynamically (this is comming from a ajax call). I can append p elements but when I try selects/options it just doesn't visually show? Is there some caching issues I should be aware of?
[06:43:16] <fl0w> Tried on chrome and safari (latest for both).
[06:44:58] <beatnyk> alrigh doug65536, I fixed everything but it's still not collapsing, http://uploadwire.com/download/305/LegitCodes.zip
[06:45:13] <beatnyk> fancybox is loaded and everything else, i made sure
[06:46:37] <beatnyk> this is strange as heck
[06:47:29] <doug65536> beatnyk: ok, looking...
[06:47:38] <beatnyk> thank you doug65536
[06:48:37] <_rgn> fl0w: i don't understand your question and i feel others may not either, perhaps provide example code of what you're doing
[06:48:44] <doug65536> beatnyk: tooltip is not loaded
[06:48:50] <fl0w> I'm working on it :) brb with a fiddle.
[06:50:04] <doug65536> beatnyk: the browser just abandons the rest of the script on the first uncaught exception
[06:50:22] <beatnyk> tooltip...hold up
[06:52:24] <fl0w> _rgn: http://jsfiddle.net/d4ZEW/ this is what I'm trying to do
[06:53:07] <fl0w> (sorry, updated it just now)
[06:53:11] <beatnyk> doug65536, does it still have an exception now?
[06:53:30] <doug65536> beatnyk: gets further now
[06:53:47] <beatnyk> hrm
[06:53:54] <beatnyk> still not loading something though?
[06:54:30] <beatnyk> man this is a mindwarp
[06:54:33] <doug65536> beatnyk: $("#navMenu a.selected") doesn't exist, so it crashes because offset() returns undefined
[06:56:06] <beatnyk> ah crud I don't know what to do there then
[06:56:10] <doug65536> beatnyk: or $('#thingThatDoesntExist').offset()   <--- returns undefined
[06:56:26] <doug65536> beatnyk: $('#thingThatDoesntExist').offset().left   <--- crash
[06:56:42] <beatnyk> i merged some other code into a ppd script i have
[06:56:53] <beatnyk> im definitely no jquery ninja
[06:56:59] <beatnyk> came dang close though
[06:57:13] <doug65536> beatnyk: looks good
[06:57:31] <beatnyk> i figured the code would work if i merged it straight over
[06:57:42] <beatnyk> with the collapsible 'report file' and 'help' containers
[06:57:47] <doug65536> beatnyk: .selected is probably causing the main problem
[06:58:51] <beatnyk> got rid of it
[06:58:54] <doug65536> beatnyk: that code doesn't make a lot of sense though. perhaps an if to see if anything is selected?
[06:59:08] <beatnyk> i just ditched the 'selected'
[06:59:08] <doug65536> beatnyk: it would make sense if something was selected
[06:59:50] <doug65536> beatnyk: you need to upload for me to debug past that
[07:00:47] <_rgn> fl0w: don't see any issue there
[07:01:02] <fl0w> is it working for u in the fiddle?
[07:01:09] <beatnyk> doug65536 http://pastebin.com/Un29aSRh
[07:01:18] <beatnyk> is that what you need?
[07:01:37] <doug65536> beatnyk: no, I mean, you need to update site so I can debug further
[07:01:45] <_rgn> fl0w: ah missing )
[07:01:58] <beatnyk> doug65536, i removed selected already though, it's useless
[07:02:04] <_rgn> fl0w: read the console for errors
[07:02:14] <_rgn> ctrl/cmd-alt-j in chrome
[07:03:09] <doug65536> ctrl+shift+j on my chrome
[07:03:31] <_rgn> yeah possibly different on windows/linux
[07:03:43] <doug65536> yeah. mine's linux
[07:04:47] <doug65536> beatnyk: you need to update the site
[07:05:01] <doug65536> beatnyk: if you want me to debug any further
[07:05:28] <doug65536> beatnyk: .selected is still there
[07:06:27] <beatnyk> looking
[07:07:02] <beatnyk> can't find 'selected' anywhere in source
[07:07:08] <doug65536> beatnyk: init.js line 29
[07:07:21] <doug65536> the webserver's copy. you uploaded changes to website?
[07:07:44] <doug65536> I'm force-reloading
[07:08:33] <beatnyk> doug65536, oh baby it's alive!
[07:08:41] <beatnyk> <3
[07:09:56] <doug65536> beatnyk: responsible is misspelled on the site, in the help section. it says "responsable"
[07:11:14] <beatnyk> right on
[07:11:24] <beatnyk> gotta figure out how to get 'download' on the top div now
[07:11:30] <beatnyk> and change that, and we're all good
[07:11:32] <beatnyk> thank you
[07:11:36] <doug65536> yw
[07:15:45] <beatnyk> no clue how the right div just meandered over to the right of the page, any idea doug65536?
[07:15:49] <beatnyk> last little thing? lol
[07:16:48] <beatnyk> nevermind doug65536, got it
[07:16:55] <beatnyk> thanks again man! =)
[07:21:48] <fl0w> _rgn: heh, I forgot to close a previous form element (forgot the /) which messed up my next form! Sorry about this, stupid mistake.
[07:29:42] <jop008_> Google chrome having a debugger statemnet in  my code how can I stop the debugger (debugger statement is in a loop)
[07:30:38] <Asmooh> if i use <ul data-filter="true" data-role="listview" data-divider-theme="c"> and all the <li>'s are in a <div></div> as result, should they still accept the UL's layout?
[07:31:09] <doug65536> jop008_: you should be able to doubleclick the line and remove the debugger; statement
[07:31:39] <jop008_> close the debugger will help
[07:31:58] <doug65536> jop008_: yes I was going to suggest that... I thought you needed to still debug
[07:32:00] <jop008_> I tried double click
[07:32:08] <jop008_> thanks
[07:32:36] <jop008_> If you have time avail for the translate job please let me know :-)
[07:33:09] <doug65536> jop008_: ok
[07:36:24] <Asmooh> http://blackberry.github.io/jQueryMobile-BB10-Theme/kitchenSink/listview.html   <<< for some strange reason my photos are bigger, or should i resize them to 119x119?
[07:37:08] <Asmooh> it doesnt really work anyway
[07:37:09] <Asmooh> :P
[07:58:31] <Tingle> Can someone explain to me why when loading my page, FF displays it loading everything twice, a 0KB and normal version... http://i.imgur.com/G1Y9P0i.jpg
[08:00:14] <Asmooh> https://www.dropbox.com/s/auw9be9aypdgpi2/IMG_00000602.png
[08:00:21] <Asmooh> doesnt make sense
[08:00:29] <Asmooh> http://blackberry.github.io/jQueryMobile-BB10-Theme/kitchenSink/listview.html
[08:00:34] <Asmooh> it should be left..
[08:04:34] <kristofers> i have a if else with this as the condition if( $('#categories').has('.hd'))
[08:04:44] <kristofers> and it always passes no matter if categories has it or not
[08:07:13] <jop008_> jqm how to specify the td width?
[08:08:16] <shoky> Tingle: check the response status/headers for each of them
[08:09:21] <Tingle> shoky, what am I looking for?
[08:09:54] <shoky> Tingle: the status code. like 200. or 302 or smth
[08:10:05] <Tingle> 200
[08:10:06] <Tingle> on both
[08:10:27] <shoky> and the headers, for the first one?
[08:10:28] <Asmooh> jop008_, i tought it should be automatic
[08:10:28] <Asmooh> :)
[08:10:43] <Tingle> same
[08:10:47] <Tingle> but one has a response body
[08:10:49] <Tingle> where the other doesnt
[08:10:55] <Tingle> hence the 0kb
[08:12:21] <Tingle> what could cause this?
[08:12:37] <Tingle> a empty response, it doesnt seem to create the page twice,
[08:12:39] <shoky> Tingle: both the request and response headers are exactly the same?
[08:12:55] <Tingle> yes
[08:13:14] <shoky> can you show it
[08:13:26] <avro> kristofers, add .length
[08:13:35] <shoky> anyway i dunno, Tingle
[08:13:40] <kristofers> yeah just found this
[08:13:40] <kristofers> .length ? "Yes" : "No"
[08:14:04] <avro> it returns an empty jquery object or whatever so it's true
[08:14:53] <_rgn> https://gist.github.com/raneksi/6404980
[08:15:51] <Tingle> http://i.imgur.com/sb4kdjw.jpg whereas the left on is the 0kb without a response body
[08:15:57] <Tingle> @shoky
[08:17:26] <shoky> donno Tingle, see what you get in another browser
[08:17:40] <Tingle> dunno, but other webpages don't do that
[08:18:53] <shoky> ok, you could still learn something by trying it in chrome for example
[08:19:24] <Tingle> where can I view that is chrome
[08:19:47] <shoky> press F12 and go to the network tab
[08:20:44] <Tingle> hmm, guess its a firefox bug, everything shows up once in chrome
[08:21:44] <Tingle> well thanks for the help
[08:21:55] <Tingle> guess FF needs a bug fix
[08:22:09] <Tingle> ive noticed this in the last time tho, the new firefox version seems abit buggy and unstable
[08:22:26] <Tingle> and its webgl performance is beginning to lack compared to other browsers
[08:22:47] <shoky> adunno, i'm @chrome
[08:46:12] <jop008_> If i have html with select in it in a html string can I do a trigger("create") to update the rendering of the selectbox?
[08:46:52] <jop008_> I have 52 selectboxes in a table
[08:49:35] <jop008_> quote missing
[08:53:35] <Glasswalker> Ok, I have a problem. I am using Highcharts (jquery plugin) for charting. See this example: http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.7.2/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/highcharts/exporting/buttons-contextbutton-menuitems/
[08:53:52] <Glasswalker> In there line 24 and 31 I need to specify callback functions in the config
[08:54:11] <Glasswalker> The problem is I'm passing this config via ajax into the app (using getJSON from a php script that returns the json)
[08:57:29] <Glasswalker> This is the json being output from my php script: http://pastebin.com/N7RzztN7
[08:57:52] <Glasswalker> I realize JSON itself doesn't allow for passing functions. So how am I supposed to pass a callaback to be used?
[08:58:32] <Glasswalker> I know if I interpret the above with eval() it will be fine
[08:59:00] <Glasswalker> but I'm not familiar enough with jquery to know how I should do that to get the appropriate result (as an alternative to using getJSON()
[08:59:18] <fkm> JSONP?
[09:02:52] <Glasswalker> yeah I looked into JSONP but again, don't know enough about how it works to use it
[09:04:00] <Glasswalker> Basically I am currently doing this: http://pastebin.com/cxetyRu2
[09:04:54] <Glasswalker> And I need to know how to alter that so that the json here: http://pastebin.com/N7RzztN7 is interpreted so the javascript callback survives through so that Highcharts knows what callback functions to use for it's menu items.
[09:06:15] <avro> sounds like highcharts is expecting you to use jsonp?
[09:06:53] <avro> JSONP just wraps your json inside a callback
[09:07:36] <Glasswalker> ok
[09:07:45] <Glasswalker> that helps, so how do I use jsonp with jquery?
[09:07:53] <Glasswalker> all I know is using getJSON
[09:08:03] <Glasswalker> so obviously I need to use something different to fetch it then
[09:08:45] <avro> jquery handles it
[09:08:51] <Zak> i think all you need to do is specify a callback query parameter
[09:08:52] <avro> i think you specify it as a type or in the url
[09:09:00] <Zak> there's probably other ways to do it. check the jquery api
[09:09:37] <Zak> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[09:10:01] <Zak> 1/3 down, section titled JSONP
[09:10:23] <fl0w> Maybe a stupid question, but can I get a FormData object from a HTML form element using jQuery or do I have to create it myself?
[09:10:34] <fkm> Glasswalker: http://docs.highcharts.com/#cross-domain-data
[09:11:15] <fl0w> i.e. var fd = new FormData($('form')); // this doesn't populate the object, and I'd rather not append everything manually
[09:11:28] <fl0w> sorry, that should be an id identifier
[09:11:50] <Foxhoundz> I got a problem with this form
[09:12:16] <fkm> Glasswalker: But otherwise I can't see why you would need to use callbacks otherwise http://docs.highcharts.com/#preprocessing-data-from-a-database
[09:14:45] <Zak> fl0w: are you sure it doesn't populate the data?
[09:15:27] <Zak> maybe because jquery is returning an array of objects?
[09:15:34] <fl0w> Hm, I'm really not (thought I could console.log the object but realised maybe I'll check a live post request on server side instead)
[09:16:47] <fkm> Does anyone see, why the node_parent.parent() would work inside the jQuery.ajax() (lines 39,42,45 and 62,65,68) but not directly inside the jQuery.fn function (10,11 and 17,18 and 24,25)? I had both inside a request and since I removed the request around the first if-clause, the parent() stopped working (node_parent seems to be fine). http://dpaste.com/1362824/
[09:21:13] <fl0w> Zak: Well, what I want to do is to get all fields from a form and just submit it with post, but it's dynamically generated - I'm kind of stupid now (in crunch, been up all night)
[09:21:26] <fl0w> I dont even need to send a FormData :/
[09:21:31] <fkm> All I get is this: http://wstaw.org/m/2013/09/01/plasma-desktopuU2261.png
[09:22:03] <Zak> fl0w: there's a relatively easy way to do that in jquery
[09:22:24] <Zak> fl0w: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/ Does this help?
[09:23:44] <fl0w> Zak: So when I build an object myself (like so: $.post('url', {index: value, index2: value2}, 'json').done(function(data) { /* … */ }); It doesn't serialize it, right?
[09:25:13] <Zak> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[09:25:19] <Zak> $.post("test.php", $("#testform").serialize());
[09:25:25] <Zak> i think thats the one you might be after
[09:25:34] <Zak> try it and see?
[09:25:48] <Zak> if you want json though
[09:25:52] <Zak> that's not going to work
[09:26:35] <Zak> it sounds like you want to create JSON which represents a form
[09:26:59] <Zak> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184624/convert-form-data-to-js-object-with-jquery
[09:29:28] <fl0w> Ya, just found it. I pretty much need to do it the "hard" way .. sigh
[09:29:39] <fl0w> (ie. not use a built-in fn … heh)
[09:29:56] <fl0w> Much appreciated Zak
[09:30:02] <Zak> np. best of luck
[09:30:11] <fl0w> I need it, I'm in crunch
[09:31:59] <Zak> fl0w: Just be careful around files (if that's included in your dynamically created form)
[09:32:05] <Zak> fl0w: http://tinyurl.com/kpzg63g
[09:33:43] <fl0w> Yea I'm not. I do that in a separate stage of the application (of which the new dynamic form is generated) - I used XHR2 and FormData objects for that, we're ok! Thanks for the heads-up!
[09:34:00] <fl0w> Zak: ^
[09:34:05] <Zak> ok cool
[09:36:41] <Zak> fl0w: https://code.google.com/p/form2js/
[09:37:06] <Zak> not sure if thats helpful
[09:37:28] <ekkis> could anyone make a suggestion? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18554336/where-to-publish-code-and-issue-an-rfc
[09:40:21] <fkm> Found the problem! :-D It was in another script. The controls node hasn't been attached at the moment the .fn function was called.
[09:40:27] <fkm> So there was no parent
[09:41:25] <Zak> ekkis: i would say github. Look at ways people have supplied extensions to jquery
[10:20:34] <mehwork> i added google analytics javascript to my page but i don't see it when i view source or inspect the page. It added in the head of my document dynamically via jquery's getScript but all i see is: <script type="text/javascript" async="" src="http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js"></script>
[10:20:59] <mehwork> is that normal? Because on sites like stackoverflow when inspect their pages i can see the full analytics snippet
[10:22:10] <mehwork> i also tried it with just php echoing the script instead of using .getScript and it does the same thing of just showing: <script type="text/javascript" async="" src="http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js"></script>
[10:48:59] <stratoss> mehwork: it seems that you're not adding the tracking code
[10:49:09] <stratoss> this is a good start: http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/setupchecklist.html
[11:25:23] <clime> guys How can I set height of jquery dialog? This does not work for me: $('<div></div>').dialog({ heigth: 600 });  http://jsfiddle.net/Hq7Vx/4/
[11:29:55] <pixelpimp> clime: spellcheck.
[11:30:24] <clime> pixelpimp: oh wow
[11:30:24] <pixelpimp> your code is fine, but you misspelled 'height.'
[11:30:47] <clime> thx man, just spent 10 mins on it lolz
[11:30:57] <clime> almost post to stackoverflow xD
[11:31:04] <pixelpimp> sometimes it takes a set of fresh eyes :)
[11:32:33] <grafi> or autocompletion
[11:32:34] <grafi> :P
[11:34:12] <pixelpimp> yeah, that too.  I recommend Sublime Text 3 as a development enviroment
[11:35:29] <grafi> do the plugins work yetß
[11:35:32] <grafi> ?
[11:35:42] <tw2113> i'm still on 2
[11:36:06] <grafi> me too
[11:40:09] <pixelpimp> if the plugins were written for 3, yeah
[11:40:20] <pixelpimp> or adapted.  not sure how much changed back end
[11:40:36] <pixelpimp> package control only lists the compatible ones for you
[11:40:54] <grafi> i looked at it back when it was announced
[11:41:12] <grafi> but there were virtually no plugins available yet, so i just ignored it :P
[11:41:41] <pixelpimp> ot
[11:41:46] <pixelpimp> it's not so bad now
[11:43:31] <grafi> yeah its been some time
[11:43:38] <Maffelu> I have a situation with a jQueryUI accordion where my content div, with a width set to 100%, is having a pixel width of 1900 while its parent has a width of only 1034. Anyone had a problem like that? No text or anything inside the div, it is just huge.
[11:44:32] <pixelpimp> i always hated word problems
[11:44:55] <clime> anyone here has experience with jquery uniform? I am getting TypeError: window.getComputedStyle(...) is null :(
[11:45:13] <clime> when uniform tries to be inited in an iframe
[11:47:35] <Maffelu> Rather, now that I look at it I have two divs in my accordion (two contents) and one is huge and the other is normal. Both are empty though!
[11:51:13] <Maffelu> It's even worse. It's because the second div has display: none on startup so it gets width: 100% and its not calculated until its shown. Argh
[12:00:13] <pixelpimp> Maffelu: live version/jsfiddle?
[12:00:23] <Maffelu> behind a login :(
[12:00:41] <pixelpimp> try to recreate it in jsfiddle if you can?
[12:01:10] <Maffelu> pixelpimp, but I figured it out. It's because the width of a hidden element is set to 100% and is calculated when displayed that I get the wrong values
[12:01:29] <pixelpimp> oh
[12:01:40] <pixelpimp> well alright then ;P
[12:09:55] <username> 3
[12:10:19] <pixelpimp> never.
[12:29:18] <trappist> Hi I'm hoping to get some help with jquery file upload. I've got all the js loaded, uploads work, I can explicitly create a preview in the done callback, but without that I can't get a preview. What might I be missing?
[12:29:38] <trappist> Or, what's the link between the data object and the template?
[12:33:51] <trappist> additional details: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jquery-fileupload/TwbfbhF1IJs
[13:15:28] <grafi> boop
[14:31:22] <Asmooh> ladiela
[14:46:13] <avro> can anyone recommend a concise jquery best practices resource?
[15:13:20] <TeddyMurray> hi
[15:13:23] <TeddyMurray> anyone need help?
[15:40:35] <ekkis> hei guys, I'm looking for a plugin to handle dialogue boxes? I've looked at Alertify.js, which seems very limited in its capability, and avgrund.js which is quite nice but has a very awkward interface? can anyone recommend anything?
[15:52:25] <molossus> Does anyone know what a +(plus) sign before a jquery selector means? i found this line: var userAnswer = +$('input[name=answer]:checked').val();  at  http://bootcampcoder.blogspot.com/2013/07/my-first-simple-js-quiz-app.html?m=1,  im not really sure what the plus sign does on +$('input[name=answer]:checked').val();
[15:53:06] <molossus> is it incrementing the value? in that shouldnt that be ++ ?
[15:53:55] <shoky> molossus: it's probably for turning the string into a number
[15:54:47] <shoky> molossus: otherwise it would stay a string, and the === wouldn't work, because correctAnswer is a number
[15:55:21] <molossus> thanks shoky, now that makes sense, when i take that out the answer is always wrong.
[15:55:43] <molossus> thanks, but thats a weird way of converting it into a number
[15:56:08] <molossus> i was expecting to see something like: parseInt or something like that
[15:57:23] <shoky> yeah that'd be better to use
[16:03:29] <Asmooh> doesnt this work anymore: data-role="dialog"?
[16:03:46] <Asmooh> "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeName' of undefined "
[16:29:34] <Doxin> is it possible to trigger an event as soon as the value of an input element changes? the onchange event only triggers when it loses focus, and keyup doesn't catch stuff like using the right click menu to paste.
[16:38:38] <trappist> Doxin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17384218/jquery-input-event
[16:39:41] <Doxin> trappist: oh nice, thanks
[16:48:19] <Asmooh> can jquery refresh pages in background like to notify the person that they have a new notification?
[16:49:12] <duckgoose> sure can
[16:49:39] <Asmooh> or is there a better way?
[16:50:17] <duckgoose> I think the most efficient way is to was websockets, but I don't
[16:50:27] <duckgoose> -was+use
[16:51:08] <duckgoose> I'd use json personally
[16:52:37] <Doxin> Asmooh: you could try and set up long-polling
[16:52:42] <Asmooh> well it connects to lets say my server, when its 1 (new) it should give like a small slidedown popup that doesnt interrupy
[16:53:05] <Doxin> Asmooh: just make the update page take forever to load if nothing is new.
[16:53:36] <Asmooh> it will only show 1 line max
[16:53:42] <duckgoose> and have a lot of idle connections to your server o.o
[16:53:50] <Asmooh> true
[16:54:02] <Doxin> duckgoose: depending on what server you run that's not necessarily a problem.
[16:55:59] <Doxin> duckgoose: if you run something greenlet/select based it only wastes the socket on that connection, but not any significant processing power. it has the advantage of having instant notifications.
[16:56:04] <Asmooh> well than i need to think whats the best to do
[16:56:05] <Asmooh> :)
[16:56:19] <Doxin> Asmooh: just refresh a page every X minutes if its not time critical
[16:56:28] <Asmooh> yeah
[16:56:47] <Doxin> Asmooh: if instant feedback is required use long polling or websockets or whatnot
[16:56:49] <Asmooh> maybe that the person can choose the time
[17:06:24] <Asmooh> grrr
[17:06:28] <Asmooh> damn swipe
[17:09:30] <Asmooh> hm so the swipe part cannot be in a external js file
[17:09:32] <Asmooh> annoying
[18:23:30] <TheArtofBalance> Hey Jquery. Im running a small side show with come jquery that looks like this: $('#slider').scrollable({    circular: true,    touch: false,    easing: 'easeOutExpo',   speed: 1100 }).navigator({    navi: '#navigation'  }).autoscroll({    autoplay: true,   autopause:true,    interval: 7000 }); Is there an easy way to add a fade transition here?
[18:36:41] <amitprakash> hi, an ajax function is trigger on clicking a link. In 'success': function(data) {} against the ajax, i wish to pass the element clicked, how do I do this?
[18:37:50] <amitprakash> something like $('a.class').on('click', function() { var elem = $(this); $.ajax({success: function(data, elem) {}); });
[18:43:46] <amitprakash> nm, seems like what i wrote works
[18:46:55] <amitprakash> Another question, I have a $('a.remove_json').on('click', function(e) {}); However this function works only on pre-existing links matching selector on the page, not the ones created post document.load via javascript, what gives?
[18:48:50] <TheArtofBalance> Maybe you can answer a question for me: Im running a small side show with come jquery that looks like this: $('#slider').scrollable({    circular: true,    touch: false,    easing: 'easeOutExpo',   speed: 1100 }).navigator({    navi: '#navigation'  }).autoscroll({    autoplay: true,   autopause:true,    interval: 7000 }); Is there an easy way to add a fade transition here?
[19:09:31] <doug65536> amitprakash: selectors like that only apply at the moment they run
[19:10:27] <doug65536> amitprakash: try $('body').on('click', 'a.remove_json', function(event) { var element = $(event.target); ...they clicked 'element'... });
[19:14:18] <doug65536> amitprakash: about your earlier ajax question: javascript has closures, it can capture access to variables in its parent scopes. if you use my suggestion from a moment ago, then in the success callback, you can use 'element'
[19:21:25] <TAoB> Any of you brilliant minds available to help  out a new guy?
[19:23:33] <Dreamer3> ask
[19:24:38] <TAoB> Im using a jquery form that lookslike this:       $('#slider').scrollable({    circular: true,    touch: true,   easing: 'easeOutExpo',   speed: 1100 }).navigator({    navi: '#navigation'  }).autoscroll({    autoplay: true,   autopause:true,    interval: 7000 });
[19:24:55] <TAoB> Im wondering iof there is a soimple way to add a fade transition
[19:29:50] <TAoB> * Jquery image slider, sorry I dont know why I said form. I'd just like a nice fade transition between images.
[20:20:40] <TAoB> Anyone avaiable to try and answer a question concerning jquery image sliders?
[20:29:23] <gordian> TAoB: ask
[20:31:29] <TAoB> Im using a simple jquery image slider. I would like to be able to adda rule to fade the images as they slide. The jquery that I have looks like this: $('#slider').scrollable({    circular: true,    touch: true,   easing: 'easeOutExpo',   speed: 1100 }).navigator({    navi: '#navigation'  }).autoscroll({    autoplay: true,   autopause:true,    interval: 7000 });
[20:38:52] <TAoB> Thoughts gordian ?
[20:39:00] <tw2113> unless that slider plugin offers the options for such things, you'll need to code it yourself
[20:39:22] <TAoB> To be honest, Im not even sure what plugin it is.
[20:39:24] <gordian> TAoB: why not just post a jsfiddle so we can see it
[20:39:34] <TAoB> I can do that.
[20:39:58] <gordian> yeeeaahh if you could go ahead and take care of that, that would be great
[20:40:00] <gordian> thaaaaaaaanks
[20:40:22] <gordian> </office_space>
[20:40:37] <TAoB> Hewre we go. http://jsfiddle.net/rCxTJ/

[20:41:06] <tw2113> http://jquerytools.org/demos/scrollable/index.html ?
[20:41:10] <gordian> dude
[20:41:12] <gordian> seriously
[20:41:19] <gordian> TAoB: post some damn content in there
[20:41:27] <TAoB> I promise I didnt write this.
[20:41:33] <gordian> …preferably the content you're actually using
[20:42:07] <TAoB> how about I give you a live example instead?
[20:42:20] <TAoB> dev.collarcitytattoo.com
[20:42:43] <gordian> ugh
[20:42:55] <gordian> i can't edit and play around with your live example, can i?
[20:43:13] <TAoB> well no, but Im not sure what content to include to even make it work for you.
[20:43:32] <TAoB> Im pressy new to the jquery thing gordian, although I do appreciate the help.
[20:43:36] <TAoB> pretty
[20:43:49] <gordian> are you Brian Kimball?
[20:43:54] <TAoB> I am not.
[20:44:03] <gordian> did you design the site or is it a template?
[20:44:03] <TAoB> Hes a telented tattoo artist.
[20:44:19] <TAoB> I co-designed it.
[20:44:26] <TAoB> mostly the visual design/
[20:44:29] <gordian> nice work
[20:44:34] <TAoB> Thank you.
[20:45:09] <TAoB> Im obviously not so good with the programming aspects. but my programmer is over seas and unreachable/
[20:46:10] <gordian> but if the images fade as they slide then the background will be visible behind them...
[20:46:19] <gordian> i don't know why you would want that
[20:46:28] <gordian> most slideshow usually fade OR slide
[20:46:30] <TAoB> can they fade to eachother?
[20:46:46] <TAoB> Id be willing to sacrifice the slide for the fade I think.
[20:46:46] <gordian> you want it to fade instead of slide?
[20:46:55] <TAoB> Im speakign from a strictly visual perspective here.
[20:47:09] <gordian> let's see...
[20:47:33] <gordian> oh man that site isn't repsonsive
[20:47:38] <gordian> that makes me cry
[20:48:12] <TAoB> I know right.
[20:48:36] <TAoB> Im sad about it too unfortuantely I know almost nothing about dynamic grids or media queries, altjhough I am looking into it.
[20:48:49] <TAoB> I would LOVE to get it responsive.
[20:49:09] <TAoB> It would be icing on the cake.
[20:49:28] <gordian> if you ask me, responsive starts in the design phase so you might have missed the boat on that
[20:49:32] <gordian> but it's never too late
[20:49:34] <gordian> anyway
[20:49:47] <gordian> that slideshow is actually http://jquerytools.org/demos/scrollable/index.html
[20:49:51] <gordian> it's called SCROLLABLE
[20:50:01] <gordian> so it's not really a slideshow, it's a carousel
[20:50:05] <LinuxPhreak> Can someone help me with this http://pastebin.com/QKbsZPhp
[20:50:20] <TAoB> I was thinking these were related, and I actually visited this page looking for a work around.
[20:50:31] <gordian> TAoB: so you can either script your own quick little fading slideshow or grab one
[20:51:02] <gordian> but visually, i think "fade the images as they slide" will look hideous
[20:51:08] <gordian> and not smooth at all
[20:51:21] <gordian> TAoB: try using Nivo slider if you don't need responsive
[20:51:43] <gordian> or FlexSlider if you want it to be responsive with some more flexibility
[20:52:00] <TAoB> Well, Im going to go ahead and guess that scripting one from scratch is probably out of the question.  If what you say about the background showing through I would also agree with you about the fade and slide.... Grabbing some code maybe be more ideal, although Id still new some assistance implementing it into my current build.
[20:52:29] <gordian> TAoB: check your private msg
[20:56:14] <gordian> TAoB: for the most painless installation, given your current markup, i recommend FlexSlider
[20:56:27] <gordian> http://flexslider.woothemes.com/
[20:56:45] <gordian> are you comfortable with FTP or ssh?
[20:57:35] <Rael> anyone use sencha
[20:58:35] <gordian> i don't, but this chan is for jquery ;-)
[21:04:41] <TAoB> gordian checking that out now.
[21:06:56] <TAoB> I use FTP
[21:06:58] <TAoB> filezilla
[21:07:28] <Rael> can you comment on native vs html5 debate
[21:17:51] <gordian> TAoB: let me know when you have the FlexSlider files
[21:18:13] <TAoB> sure thing, getting a bit side tracked here, haha.
[21:19:58] <TAoB> OKay, downloaded and unzipped.
[21:20:20] <gordian> ok
[21:20:45] <gordian> throw the flexslider-min.js into http://dev.collarcitytattoo.com/js/
[21:21:05] <gordian> and put the flexslider-min.css into http://dev.collarcitytattoo.com/css/
[21:21:30] <TAoB> alrighty. hang tight.
[21:21:34] <gordian> you should also upload the images directory into the web root or you'll get 404 errors
[21:22:37] <TAoB> well I have an image folder int here now, the guy who set up the splash did a terrible job but the images in that folder control the live splash / landing page
[21:22:49] <TAoB> all my images are in /dev/images
[21:23:18] <gordian> in the flexslider files there should be an images folder
[21:23:26] <gordian> that needs to go in your web root for now
[21:23:31] <TAoB> ok
[21:23:33] <gordian> because that's where flexslider will look
[21:23:39] <gordian> by default
[21:24:09] <gordian> then you need to edit the <head> section of the site to include both of those files
[21:24:26] <gordian> just follow the pattern of the css and js files that are already there
[21:24:41] <gordian> but make sure to add the flexslider.css as the FIRST css file
[21:24:57] <gordian> and make sure to add the flexslider.js AFTER jquery
[21:25:12] <gordian> hang tight once you have that done i'll brb
[21:25:15] <TAoB> flexslider-min.css doiesnt exist anywhere
[21:25:57] <TAoB> flexslider.min is a javascript file
[21:26:16] <TAoB> flexslider.css
[21:28:02] <TAoB> Okay let me lonk those in just one of the templates since this slider is on everyone of them without exception
[21:29:57] <TAoB> all set.
[21:30:18] <TAoB> working on the index, btw
[21:33:05] <TAoB> Ready when you are gordian
[21:34:46] <DrkShadow> How can I determine if $option is checked? $option.checked()? $(option, ':checked') ?
[21:35:43] <DrkShadow> .is().. ok.
[21:36:13] <gordian> TAoB: make sure the flexslider.css is the FIRST css file… above main.css
[21:38:23] <LinuxPhreak> when someone gets the chance can they help to get thiis code to work http://pastebin.com/QKbsZPhp
[21:39:48] <TAoB> ok
[21:40:34] <TAoB> done.
[21:41:35] <gordian> k
[21:41:54] <gordian> now you need to edit sliderTweaks.js
[21:42:04] <gordian> wait
[21:42:05] <gordian> actually
[21:42:16] <gordian> first you need to move it below the flexslider.js in the <head>
[21:42:20] <gordian> then we need to edit it
[21:42:44] <TAoB> ok
[21:42:46] <TAoB> haha
[21:43:26] <TAoB> alright, lets edit that monster.
[21:43:27] <gordian> before you edit it you should make a backup
[21:43:39] <gordian> well
[21:43:47] <gordian> screw it
[21:43:50] <TAoB> lol
[21:43:52] <gordian> i'd be doing you a disservice
[21:43:53] <TAoB> I have one
[21:43:57] <gordian> but trying to make this quick
[21:44:01] <TAoB> Its already a disservice
[21:44:02] <gordian> but let's do it right
[21:44:09] <TAoB> look at the damn thing
[21:44:20] <gordian> so go back to index.html and comment out that sliderTweak.js or get rid of it altogether
[21:44:37] <gordian> we don't want it loaded at all
[21:44:52] <TAoB> ok
[21:45:08] <gordian> then make a new blank text file called main.js and upload it into the js/ directory on the server
[21:45:13] <gordian> then open it and let's edit that
[21:45:26] <gordian> i'll show you what goes in it when you're ready
[21:46:37] <TAoB> lets do it.
[21:46:40] <TAoB> Im set
[21:49:40] <gordian> ok
[21:49:52] <gordian> we need to edit a bit of markup too real quick
[21:49:57] <gordian> keep main.js open for editing
[21:50:00] <TAoB> k
[21:50:03] <gordian> but let's edit index.html real quick
[21:50:30] <TAoB> alright.
[21:50:34] <gordian> each image in the slider is inside a div
[21:50:49] <gordian> instead of a div, let's put them each into a list item
[21:51:04] <gordian> <li><img src="example.jpg"></li>
[21:51:06] <gordian> just like that
[21:51:24] <TAoB> ok
[21:53:11] <gordian> then change <div id="items"> into <ul id="items" class="slides">
[21:53:20] <gordian> and don't forget to change the closing tag
[21:56:34] <gordian> there you go
[21:56:35] <TAoB> done.
[21:56:45] <gordian> now put this into main.js: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Rpg08zc0
[21:57:24] <TAoB> okay. done
[21:58:05] <gordian> ok
[21:58:14] <gordian> now add main.js into the <head> in index.html
[21:58:20] <gordian> make sure it's LAST
[21:58:23] <gordian> in the js files
[21:59:00] <TAoB> done.
[22:00:02] <gordian> that should be it...
[22:00:05] <gordian> let's see
[22:00:35] <gordian> oh
[22:00:56] <gordian> gordian: and make sure to add the flexslider.js AFTER jquery
[22:00:58] <TAoB> nothing yet.
[22:01:16] <gordian> that was for you TAoB
[22:01:32] <gordian> there you go
[22:01:32] <TAoB> got ya.
[22:02:02] <gordian> et voila
[22:02:18] <TAoB> now question
[22:02:23] <TAoB> you are awesome btw
[22:02:41] <TAoB> these dots arew now doing nothing and theyre not incontrol of the slider anymore
[22:03:00] <TAoB> can we add code to main .js to fix that?
[22:03:17] <gordian> let's see...
[22:08:47] <TAoB> Yeah, Im not even sure where the controls wre to begin with.
[22:11:57] <gordian> ok
[22:12:07] <gordian> put this into main.js and replace everything that's in there: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=crmSqhju
[22:13:09] <gordian> TAoB:
[22:13:17] <gordian> replace all of main.js with that pastebin
[22:13:50] <TAoB> okay
[22:14:08] <gordian> wait
[22:14:39] <TAoB> No that did it.
[22:15:00] <TAoB> at least its workin in ff.
[22:15:00] <gordian> use this one: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=aRzSHBdP
[22:15:05] <gordian> it's better
[22:15:09] <gordian> slight difference
[22:15:37] <gordian> actually still not 100%
[22:16:17] <TAoB> Yeah, first one isnt clickable
[22:16:38] <gordian> well it is
[22:16:46] <gordian> if it's already active then it's not clickable
[22:16:46] <hemangpatel> Cannot read property 'PAGE_UP' of undefined
[22:16:48] <gordian> which is how it should be
[22:16:53] <TAoB> right
[22:16:55] <hemangpatel> it happen in autocomplete
[22:16:56] <gordian> but it's not auto-advancing with the slideshow
[22:17:00] <gordian> give me a min
[22:17:02] <TAoB> exactly
[22:17:07] <TAoB> sure thing.
[22:20:16] <gordian> TAoB: replace main.js again with this: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=adPgybLP
[22:20:22] <TAoB> k
[22:20:44] <gordian> there
[22:21:16] <fdspo> I want to populate a dropdown when page loads. What are the best practices? Should I get it from server or make an ajax call?
[22:21:17] <gordian> perfect
[22:21:30] <TAoB> sexual.
[22:21:35] <gordian> err, not quite
[22:21:44] <TAoB> Bwah, now I just have to edit all the other templates accpordingly.
[22:21:51] <gordian> hmmm
[22:21:54] <TAoB> glad I took notes on what we changed.
[22:22:55] <gordian> one more main.js replacement: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=d9KRq6Sq
[22:22:57] <gordian> use that one
[22:23:01] <hemangpatel> anyone please ?
[22:23:02] <gordian> should be smoother
[22:23:52] <TAoB> yeah def  a bit smooher.
[22:24:25] <gordian> btw your images are waaaaaaay too big
[22:24:40] <TAoB> in terms of file size?
[22:24:40] <gordian> they should be < 100kb each
[22:24:42] <gordian> or close
[22:24:55] <TAoB> I tried optomizing them once with a web based editor
[22:25:11] <TAoB> can you reccomed and good way to keep teh quality a lower the file size?
[22:25:22] <TAoB> this is why I need a programmer.
[22:25:43] <TAoB> Im all astetics, No concept for what actuall works.
[22:25:49] <TAoB> Typical.
[22:25:57] <gordian> yeah, here's my advice
[22:26:02] <gordian> hire me ;-)
[22:26:21] <TAoB> done, and done. :D
[22:26:25] <gordian> but if you're using photoshop take a serious look at the "Save for Web and Devices" menu
[22:26:46] <TAoB> I use ps
[22:27:09] <gordian> weird
[22:27:11] <TAoB> I usually use ai to mock and then import, rasterize, and make final edits.
[22:27:20] <gordian> clicking that first nav still isn't working
[22:27:44] <gordian> nav dot i mean
[22:27:46] <TAoB> I do alot of hand drawn logos and stuff like that so always illustrator first. black and white.
[22:28:00] <TAoB> Really?
[22:28:07] <TAoB> shit, you're right.
[22:28:24] <TAoB> We'll if you're beat Im willing to catch up with you tomorrow whcn I get up and moving.
[22:28:29] <TAoB> This is great so far.
[22:29:00] <TAoB> This would have taken me months to do alone.
[22:29:06] <gordian> replace main.js with this: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=UhdBxH2V
[22:29:51] <TAoB> now tat works.
[22:29:53] <TAoB> that
[22:30:20] <gordian> there we go
[22:30:24] <gordian> one last replace for you though
[22:30:39] <gordian> or actually
[22:30:44] <gordian> just remove the line:     console.log($(this).index());
[22:31:03] <gordian> line 18
[22:31:16] <gordian> perfect
[22:31:23] <TAoB> awesome.
[22:33:21] <TAoB> Thank you gordian, youve been amazing. and what an improvement! way better than watching the images slide from side to side.
[22:33:36] <gordian> np
[22:33:39] <gordian> i agree, much smoother
[22:33:51] <gordian> you can tweak the settings too if you need to
[22:34:25] <TAoB> Yeah these are pretty easy to undserstand.
[22:34:35] <regedit> when i send a javascript array into an ajax call, it seems to come out on the php side with all index numeric-gaps filled with blanks
[22:34:39] <regedit> i.e. if i set my_js_array[33] = 'lol'; the array comes out on the php side with 33 elements, not just 1 who's key is 33
[22:34:47] <regedit> does this make sense?
[22:35:04] <regedit> using jquery.get()
[22:35:55] <regedit> clarification: if i create var my_js_array[33] = 'lol'; ... etc
[23:52:13] <pranavrc> hi. I'm trying to load a json file with getJSON. I can't load it from a server because of the Same Origin Policy, but when I try to load it from the local machine, Chrome says 'origin null is not allowed by access-control-allow-origin'. What's going on here?
