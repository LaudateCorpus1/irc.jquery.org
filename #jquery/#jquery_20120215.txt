[00:03:34] <mehrdad> Nomikos, i am not sure what is undefined
[00:03:58] <mehrdad> isn't the second code searching the correct fn array?
[00:04:18] <Nomikos> mehrdad: hrm.. I'm not /that/ well-versed in Javascript.. one thing I'd check/try is this[jqueryui_object] instead of this.jqueryui_object on line 21?
[00:04:49] <Nomikos> since it seems to me you're trying to access this.mqLayerManager ?
[00:05:09] <Nomikos> this.jqueryui_object -> this is a simple string value
[00:05:27] <mehrdad> no the latter is what i want
[00:05:35] <mehrdad> it works for another similar code
[00:05:42] <Nomikos> ok
[00:06:16] <mehrdad>   jqueryui_object: 'mqLayerManager', is in fact a field
[00:06:36] <Nomikos> oh right, it turns into fn['mqLayerManager'] which was defined (I guess?) earlier
[00:06:36] <mehrdad> it is a dictionary syntax i guess?
[00:06:53] <mehrdad> exactly
[00:07:15] <Nomikos> you're including the first file before trying to run the code in the 2nd file/
[00:07:16] <Nomikos> *?
[00:07:42] <ajpiano> mehrdad: you aren't setting up your $.fn correctly
[00:07:50] <ajpiano> to iterate over the jquery collection
[00:07:58] <mehrdad> the other working code is in the same file anyway Nomikos
[00:08:08] <ajpiano> mehrdad: docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[00:08:16] <mehrdad> ajpiano, i think u /know/ it
[00:08:58] <ajpiano> i'm just playin scrabble pretend i'm not even her
[00:08:59] <ajpiano> e*
[00:10:01] <mehrdad> i must use the syntax in the first example for extending fn?
[00:11:09] <mehrdad> ajpiano, the fn extension code block is part of the mapquery plugin, is it still the correct procedure to follow?
[00:11:41] <mehrdad> because it says plugin authoring, it sounds to me i will be effectively creating another plugin using that syntax?
[00:11:44] <ajpiano> i can't say with any authority, i've never heard of that plugin
[00:12:12] <ajpiano> and i'm very distracted at the moment, sorry
[00:12:19] <mehrdad> np :)
[00:12:28] <krz> not sure if this is the right channel to ask this question. anyone know how to make a gif that looks like: http://jqueryui.com/demos/progressbar/images/pbar-ani.gif
[00:13:18] <krz> at http://jqueryui.com/demos/progressbar/#animated i change the theme. the animated progress bar is still orange. anyone know why?
[00:14:57] <NihilistDandy> That resizable option can turn out some odd results :D
[00:19:51] <izepstan> short question, very glad if someone could help me with: http://jsfiddle.net/V3PPt/1/
[00:25:31] <BinaryKitten> izepstan ... not many people are going to be able to help you here..
[00:25:43] <izepstan> BinaryKitten, why?
[00:25:52] <BinaryKitten> mainly because you've not supplied any information as to what's wrong
[00:25:52] <izepstan> not a common problem?
[00:25:57] <BinaryKitten> or even asked a question
[00:26:34] <BinaryKitten> i've looked at the code in the fiddled, 1st turn the dropdown above jquery to no Wrap (head)
[00:26:49] <BinaryKitten> otherwise it wraps your code in a function closure
[00:27:03] <BinaryKitten> and then that protects them from the a click
[00:27:21] <BinaryKitten> alternatively, the better way is to bind the data and leave the click to the js
[00:27:53] <jowop> how can i use serialized data and my own array together in the jquery $.post?
[00:27:56] <amirite> arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[00:29:09] <jowop> can i do .serialize()+'&myvar='+myvar ?
[00:29:56] <BinaryKitten> izepstan also on top of all that, we do need to know what you're trying to achieve
[00:30:55] <izepstan> BinaryKitten: ok, thx, yeah that is what i do in real environement (click handler), but what im trying to get with my approach is an array like {'keyvalue:value'} from each number in the arr passed from the onClick, if the keyvalue returns a second time i'd like to have {'keyvalue:oldvalue+1'}
[00:31:32] <izepstan> BinaryKitten: is that understandable?
[00:32:51] <BinaryKitten> ah increment count
[00:33:39] * mehrdad scratches his head
[00:35:48] * mehrdad murmurs nonsense
[00:36:18] * mehrdad smells his finger
[00:40:00] * mehrdad eats wafer
[00:40:23] <kevindougans> can anyone help me setup adapt.js to include 2 css files instead of just 1?
[00:41:52] <BinaryKitten> izepstan is this more like what you want?
[00:43:26] * BinaryKitten runs off to catch a bus
[00:43:36] <izepstan> no...
[00:43:42] <BinaryKitten> izepstan http://jsfiddle.net/V3PPt/3/ i mean
[00:44:51] <izepstan> you are a genious!!!
[00:45:10] <izepstan> i tried several hours last night...
[00:45:21] <BinaryKitten> had to make the komkomp object global though
[00:45:26] <BinaryKitten> for the demo
[00:45:39] <BinaryKitten> you can store it in the output as data
[00:45:50] <kreantos> hey, is there something like knockoutjs but as a jquery plugin?
[00:46:04] <BinaryKitten> eg output.data('kompkomp', kompkomp); ~ izepstan
[00:46:55] <izepstan> ok. thank you very much.
[00:48:36] <BinaryKitten> np
[00:48:45] * BinaryKitten really really runs to catch her bus
[01:03:56] <triptec> how do I fire a change event when a radio button gets unchecked due to another radio button is pressed or something?
[01:04:34] <mehrdad> ajpiano, u available?
[01:07:22] <mehrdad> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/551289/
[01:08:35] <gabriel9> for some reason i can't pass data to bind handle function
[01:09:11] <setsunafseisei> for the datepicker how can you set the year to be ahead 5 years?
[01:09:42] <gabriel9> var foo = function(a1, a2) {...} and then $('someElem').bind('click', foo(1, 2))
[01:09:59] <kevindougans> yaaas i managed to get adapt.js to include 2 css files instead of just one, result http://goo.gl/IM0yk
[01:10:02] <Cork> gabriel9: bind takes a function reference
[01:10:21] <Cork> gabriel9: what you set is the return value from your foo function
[01:10:39] <Cork> gabriel9: 'click', function() { foo(1, 2); });
[01:10:50] <gabriel9> i also tried this $('someElem').bind('click',{a1 : 1, a2 : 2}, foo)
[01:10:56] <gabriel9> Cork, live 100 years
[01:11:15] <gabriel9> i did not thinking right
[01:11:16] <Cork> the second one sould work too
[01:11:23] <Cork> it gets added to event though
[01:11:37] <Cork> so function(event) { event.data.a1 }
[01:11:44] <Cork> * function foo(event) { event.data.a1 }
[01:12:01] <gabriel9> i will try it now
[01:12:26] <Cork> the event.data one only works in jquery 1.5+ i think though
[01:12:34] <gabriel9> i use last one
[01:12:38] <Cork> so make sure you have a new one
[01:12:42] <gabriel9> ok
[01:12:51] <gabriel9> that's not a problem
[01:13:03] <Cork> ya, but its worth mentioning up ront :)
[01:13:05] <Cork> *front
[01:13:20] <gabriel9> yea, it will save me from bugs :)
[01:13:50] <gabriel9> well this would be easy, but i need to unbind also
[01:14:14] <Cork> simplest way to do that is
[01:14:22] <gabriel9> so i can't use anonymous function :/
[01:14:22] <Cork> bind('click.foo')
[01:14:28] <Cork> unbind('click.foo')
[01:14:35] <Cork> sure you can
[01:14:40] <gabriel9> and foo is function ref
[01:14:44] <gabriel9> ?
[01:14:46] <Cork> no foo is a name
[01:15:10] <Cork> unbind('.foo') removes every event under the foo namespace
[01:15:13] <gabriel9> something like namespace
[01:15:17] <gabriel9> ahaaa
[01:15:17] <Cork> yes
[01:15:19] <gabriel9> nice one
[01:15:34] <Cork> i think so ya
[01:15:35] <Cork> :)
[01:15:47] <gabriel9> every day JS have some suprises for me
[01:15:58] <Cork> this isn't js though
[01:16:05] <Cork> its jquery specific
[01:16:23] <gabriel9> i think jQuery is more popular then JS
[01:16:29] <gabriel9> if that is possible
[01:16:32] <Cork> na
[01:16:57] <Cork> as jquery is a framework that extends javascript
[01:17:01] <Cork> thats not really posible :D
[01:17:13] <gabriel9> yea, paradox
[01:17:23] <mehrdad> i add the goddamn function to $, yet i can't call it...shit
[01:17:25] <mehrdad> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/551289/
[01:17:35] <rktic> hej
[01:17:46] <gabriel9> but still i know people whod don't know how to get parent from element using js or to get id
[01:17:52] <gabriel9> but in jQuery they know
[01:17:58] <_dave_h_d> hi all, is there a way of detecting if there is wifi present on mobile safari?
[01:18:09] <mehrdad> Cork, r u up for some help mate?
[01:18:21] <rktic> i could need a hint to make a jquery accordion tab collapsible.  jQuery(".accordion").tabs(".accordion div.pane",{collapsible: true, tabs: 'h2', effect: 'slide', initialIndex: null}); < doesn't work
[01:19:07] <Cork> mehrdad: functions you add to fn is meant to be called through $().<function name>
[01:19:37] <Cork> though as far as i can tell what you do should work farly well too
[01:19:40] <mehrdad> $.fn['fn name']  <<< is this incorrect?
[01:20:05] <Cork> $('body')['fn name']
[01:20:07] <mehrdad> thing is, it is working for an identical copy
[01:20:16] <mehrdad> just different jqueryui_object
[01:20:35] <Cork> mehrdad: if your not using it from a selector it should be added to $ directly
[01:20:47] <mehrdad> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/551289/
[01:20:52] <mehrdad> it is added, right?
[01:21:27] <Cork> it is, but your missing the point
[01:23:59] <Cork> mehrdad: http://jsfiddle.net/qLTXc/
[01:26:44] <Benn> Hey, I'm using the jQuery AJAX feature, it's send the request, the JSON all seems to be perfectly valid. I can see the request reach the server, I'm passing over 4 values 3 of which are strings and one of which is a JSON Object. the Json object just doesn't seem to get server side under the $_REQUEST. It only happens on one of my many AJAX calls, I can't seem to find any significant difference
[01:26:44] <Benn> in this call to the 8 or so other that are almost identical to it bar one value in the object which if excluded has no bearing to the call.
[01:26:49] <Benn> http://pastebin.com/v0VJtxBY < The JSON Object
[01:28:16] <Cork> Benn: you should really think about shortening your question bloats
[01:28:21] <kreantos> hey, how can i avoid, that if a select option has no value, the text is used as value?
[01:28:35] <Cork> kreantos: value=""
[01:28:43] <Cork> only way
[01:29:12] <kreantos> ah
[01:29:13] <kreantos> ok
[01:29:14] <kreantos> ty
[01:30:00] <Benn> Cork: I was trying to provide as much information as I could so I didn't get a non sensical answer
[01:30:39] <Cork> the problem is even skimming that blob i can't even find your answer
[01:30:48] <Cork> *question
[01:31:24] <mehrdad> Cork, the way the jquery timepicker plugin has added a function to $.fn and in another file it is being called with the same syntax that i am using, left me puzzled and i couldn't digest what u were explaining
[01:31:24] <Benn> The Question is Why isn't the JSON Object getting read by the server
[01:31:57] <mehrdad> it must not work according to you, what timepicker is doing is exactly like mine
[01:32:00] <Cork> Benn: cause json isn't handled in $_REQUEST
[01:32:13] <mehrdad> unless, the $ is already a selector somehow?
[01:32:31] <Cork> Benn: jquery converts js objects to params and push then to the server as http params
[01:33:12] <mehrdad> let me provide u with the timepicker code
[01:33:29] <Cork> mehrdad: whats this.$input_picker ?
[01:33:46] <who_am_i> hello
[01:33:51] <mehrdad> an element searched by class name
[01:33:55] <mehrdad> and it is loaded correctly
[01:34:08] <Benn> if I send them via a GET they will appear in the $_REQUEST No?
[01:34:09] <Cork> uh, is it an element or a jquery object?
[01:34:46] <Cork> Benn: if you send a get through $.get or $.ajax, and you give it a js object, yes it will
[01:34:52] <mehrdad> i am sure that there is a web of objects working together in this lib that i have to modify and it is inevitable that i'll get error after error when i don't know the internal working of it
[01:35:18] <Cork> Benn: the difference is json is=> var a = '<{"json":["this","is","json"]}';
[01:35:19] <mehrdad> Cork, it is [input.oe_mqLayerManager_container]
[01:35:34] <mehrdad> an array containing an element
[01:35:40] <Cork> Benn: var a = {"json":["this","is","javascipt objects"]};
[01:36:18] <Benn> Yeah I know that
[01:37:06] <Cork> mehrdad: then you can't pass it as this to the jquery functions
[01:37:13] <Cork> mehrdad: it needs a jquery object
[01:37:45] <Cork> (though jquery objects is "array like" so that might be what you have, but make sure)
[01:40:01] <RedKnight91> Hello everyone
[01:40:35] <RedKnight91> Anybody knows how to use jquery .load() command on an external page?
[01:40:48] <Cork> you can't
[01:40:51] <Cork> the browser will block you
[01:40:59] <RedKnight91> woah, really? Why?
[01:41:14] <nFFF> You can use <iframe>
[01:41:30] <RedKnight91> that's not as good : p
[01:41:31] <Cork> RedKnight91: xss
[01:41:44] <rktic> any takers for a jquery accordion related problem?
[01:41:46] <RedKnight91> can't manipulate the content
[01:42:07] <Cork> RedKnight91: the reseaving server can set a Access-Control-Allow-Origin http header though
[01:42:07] <RedKnight91> i'm looking up xss on wikipedia
[01:42:11] <Cork> to allow it
[01:42:25] <RedKnight91> gotcha
[01:42:31] <Cork> doesn't work in older browsers though
[01:42:32] <RedKnight91> thanks a lot for the explanation
[01:42:33] <Cork> like ie
[01:42:49] <mindis|wurk> drop ie support, save the world
[01:43:14] <RedKnight91> haha
[01:43:14] <Cork> mindis|wurk: tell the users not the website developers
[01:43:19] <who_am_i> guys, I'm new to this. I'll read up, I just cannot find proper plugins/starting points for this. Here's my case: http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg11/scaled.php?server=11&filename=js1e.jpg&res=medium , http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg72/scaled.php?server=72&filename=js2g.jpg&res=medium
[01:43:23] <Cork> mindis|wurk: we don't really have a choice
[01:43:34] <mindis|wurk> Cork if the users don't have an option, they'll migrate ;)
[01:43:45] <Cork> not really
[01:43:51] <who_am_i> The "hold and drag" button is supposed to, well, slide the div open, as overlay to current page
[01:43:52] <mehrdad> Cork, the timepicker function
[01:43:55] <Cork> they'l just go to another page
[01:43:56] <mindis|wurk> yes really. force is always the ultimate solution
[01:44:04] <mehrdad> btw reading ur remarks
[01:44:20] <who_am_i> "click to open", "click to close" was the closest thing I could find, with ten different effects in between
[01:45:12] <Cork> mehrdad: this is what you need to reproduce in your code (but for the correct element) $.fn['func name'].apply($('body'), arguments);
[01:45:33] <Cork> the first argument to apply need to be a jquery selector object
[01:46:25] <RedKnight91> Cork, you seem to have a great knowledge about jquery and the web : )
[01:46:47] <mehrdad> Cork is great
[01:46:56] <Cork> i've been coding javascript for close to 20 years and jquery for 5+
[01:46:58] <Cork> :)
[01:47:18] <RedKnight91> damn : D
[01:47:23] <RedKnight91> so you're a pro
[01:47:26] <Cork> i hope it gives some insight ^^
[01:47:36] <mehrdad> it certainly does
[01:47:44] <mindis|wurk> 20 years of js. i'm surprised you're still sane
[01:47:48] <RedKnight91> hahaha
[01:47:50] <mehrdad> lol
[01:47:51] <Cork> lol
[01:47:55] <mehrdad> was going to say  the same
[01:47:59] <Cork> ya, its had its down times
[01:48:08] <RedKnight91> I've been using javascript and jquery for 2 years and I'm loving it
[01:48:11] <Cork> especially when jscript and javascript was WAY different
[01:48:35] <Cork> (jscript is ms implementation of ecmascript)
[01:49:34] <mehrdad> u write js scripts for windows tasks too?
[01:49:52] <Cork> i don't use windows much anymore
[01:50:02] <mehrdad> back then?
[01:50:03] <Cork> more like how others use gaming consoles :)
[01:50:12] <Cork> but ya i used wsf quite a lot
[01:50:30] <mehrdad> very fun, right?
[01:50:31] <Cork> wrote a mailing program in it '>_>
[01:50:34] <Cork> was ok
[01:50:58] <Cork> like it a heck a lot more then vbscript
[01:51:54] <mehrdad> i am shitty when it comes to js, but once i wanted to tease the crap outa someone and i wrote a simple js script and printed ".net" to the screen every few seconds
[01:52:07] <mehrdad> they had to restart the machine to remove it from start up :))
[01:52:14] <Hooloovoork> i like javascript, i don't like the dom api.
[01:52:17] <_ikke_> I'm trying to find out what event handlers get executed when I click on a dom element. Anyone has tips how to find out?
[01:52:23] <johanhar> Hi. I got a div with some stuff that got bindings on different events. If I remove the div from the document, and then append it again, all the bindings are gone :(
[01:52:34] <_ikke_> johanhar: Yes
[01:52:37] <Hooloovoork> johanhar: yes,
[01:52:58] <johanhar> A solution?
[01:53:00] <Hooloovoork> johanhar: you have to rebind them or bind them to a element that you won't remove.
[01:53:01] <Cork> _ikke_: if you've bound the events with jquery it has an array with them
[01:53:10] <johanhar> Ok..
[01:53:10] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone know a good jquerymobile pop-up?
[01:53:18] <mindis|wurk> is it me or is the most common problem on this channel that people don't know about .on and when to use it
[01:53:22] <mehrdad> the moment they opened start  menu, the characters were printed every where and opened menu items by chance
[01:53:32] <Hooloovoork> mindis|wurk: i think so
[01:54:20] <mehrdad> they started task manage and couldnt end the process cause the characters distrupted the normal working :))
[01:54:21] <johanhar> mindis|wurk: was that coz of my question?
[01:54:24] <Hooloovoork> mindis|wurk: it's definately that people don't know how events work properly. i've seen all kinds of weird solutions to problems that don't really exist.
[01:54:26] <_ikke_> Cork: What array?
[01:54:27] <mehrdad> it was pretty fun
[01:54:51] * Cork $._data(elm, 'events')
[01:54:54] <Cork> opps
[01:54:58] <Cork> _ikke_: ^
[01:55:09] <RedKnight91> Very well then, gotta go, thanks everyone, see ya guys
[01:55:28] <_ikke_> Cork: Right
[01:55:42] <mehrdad> when was js created?
[01:55:59] <Cork> mehrdad: that depends on what you mean created
[01:56:06] <mehrdad> i know it was created by netscape
[01:56:08] <rktic> rough guess many people have rather little clue about jquery but since it's somewhat involved in most things these days you somehow have to cope with it (lookin at myself ;)
[01:56:20] <Cork> mehrdad: when if first came it was more like a form pre submit validation script
[01:56:34] <Cork> mehrdad: couldn't really do much, and was really slow
[01:56:40] <johanhar> Huh.. $(element).on is not a function.. .on is for latest jquery only, maybe I have to upgrade...
[01:56:43] <johanhar> ?
[01:56:53] <mehrdad> and what year was it?
[01:56:55] <_ikke_> $('foo')[0] doesn't return a jquery object?
[01:57:01] <Hooloovoork> johanhar: yes .on is latest version only
[01:57:02] <Cork> johanhar: or use delegate/live/bind
[01:57:03] <_ikke_> (assuming that it exists)
[01:57:09] <Hooloovoork> johanhar: don't use live
[01:57:12] <Hooloovoork> D:
[01:57:13] <johanhar> Cork: live messed up
[01:57:18] <Cork> _ikke_: no it returns a dom object
[01:57:19] <johanhar> ill try bind, thanks
[01:57:39] <mehrdad> was it 20 years ago?! O_o
[01:57:46] <Hooloovoork> johanhar: bind won't work if you do it like you did last time. read up on event bubbling and use .on or .delegate properly.
[01:57:47] <Cork> _ikke_: .eq is prob what you want see ?.eq
[01:57:47] <bot-t> _ikke_, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[01:58:20] <_ikke_> ah ok
[01:59:05] <mehrdad> 20 years ago= 1992 .... i really didn't know it existed back then
[01:59:33] <mehrdad> thought it was first created by netscape late 90s
[01:59:39] <Hooloovoork> mehrdad: mid 90's
[01:59:45] <Hooloovoork> mehrdad: wikipedia says 95
[02:00:13] <Cork> mehrdad: is said close to
[02:00:13] <mehrdad> it is not 20 years surely?
[02:00:48] <_ikke_> Cork: Hmm, handler shows function(){. Anyway to find out what function it is?
[02:00:52] <Cork> and ya i think js came somewhere around 95-96
[02:01:18] <who_am_i> http://pastebin.com/QykSPvxY
[02:01:19] <Cork> _ikke_: that means its inline functions
[02:01:25] <_ikke_> Cork: Yeah, thought so
[02:01:27] <who_am_i> any idea about this?
[02:01:32] <Cork> _ikke_: those don't really have an identify
[02:01:41] <Cork> _ikke_: you can do .toSource()
[02:01:47] <Cork> and get its source code though
[02:02:01] <mehrdad> yeah "close to 20 years" :)
[02:02:29] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone know a good jquerymobile pop-up?
[02:02:33] <mehrdad> whatever back to error :/
[02:02:48] <_ikke_> Cork: Just printing handler seems to give the source
[02:02:57] <_ikke_> and it's not what I'm expecting though :(
[02:03:33] <antdillon> Q: Hi, does anyone know an easy way to strip html comments when using .html() ?
[02:04:30] <MagePsycho> is there a way to find latest jQuery version using some rss feeds or rest api?
[02:07:44] <Cork> antdillon: .html().replace(/<\!--[^-]*-->/g', '')
[02:07:53] <Cork> opps
[02:07:59] <Cork> * .html().replace(/<\!--[^-]*-->/g, '')
[02:08:59] <Cork> MagePsycho: http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[02:09:08] <Cork> grab the second line in the file
[02:09:14] <antdillon> Cork, Thank a lot!
[02:09:24] <MagePsycho> hi Cork
[02:09:26] <optraz_> $("#myform :input").tooltip({
[02:09:30] <optraz_> what does that means?
[02:09:31] <MagePsycho> thanks man.. will take a look
[02:10:06] <Cork> optraz: find inputs that has a parent with the id myform
[02:10:15] <Cork> and run the function tooltip on those elements
[02:11:18] <Benn> What could cause a JSON Object to not get set server side from an AJAX call?
[02:11:46] <optraz> mmmm
[02:11:53] <nFFF> Your serve side script
[02:12:37] <optraz> Cork: does the fucntion tooltip come in jquery?
[02:13:23] <Cork> optraz: its a plugin for jquery
[02:14:11] <optraz> ok.... sounds sad then..
[02:16:36] <optraz> so many plugins..
[02:16:39] <optraz> i just want a simple tooltip
[02:16:50] <optraz> do i need to include another plugin in the html head section..
[02:18:47] <devOlsen> not really when you could just use an extra element like a span nested in a parent that has a position relative. Then give that span a position absolute, fill it with content and set its positition / display styles to be in its parent hover selector. something like this http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-only-tooltips/
[02:20:52] <optraz> ok that is very bsexy
[02:21:05] <_ikke_> Cork: It was the eventhandler I was finding. Thanks for the help
[02:21:26] <Cork> np
[02:23:02] <devOlsen> so apparently when you use this method to embed videos with swfobject (due to mp4 encode from server side flavor and firefox only) and I pass it a video preview image url that contains more than one query string in the url, swfobject cuts off any extra query strings byond the first one in the url..
[02:23:05] <devOlsen> grr
[02:23:23] <devOlsen> http://tinyurl.com/3xgxhf6
[02:26:26] <MagePsycho> Cork: there is: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
[02:31:55] <Cork> MagePsycho: don't use that url for live pages though
[02:32:15] <Cork> MagePsycho: that server isn't cdn distributed, so if can't handle the load
[02:32:23] <Cork> use googles cdn or some other instead
[02:32:34] <MagePsycho> oh i see
[02:34:21] <Cork> MagePsycho: http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jquery
[02:36:09] <meghdad> Cork, regarding what u said about $.fn[fn name].apply(element name...)
[02:36:42] <meghdad> the input_picker returns an element, just like how datetimepicker works
[02:37:00] <MagePsycho> thanks Cork
[02:37:19] <meghdad> but the fact that the function isn't being called is irrelevant to the parameter that is an element
[02:37:27] <meghdad> alert doesn't show up
[02:38:04] <Cork> meghdad: have you checked that your picker function is called?
[02:38:35] <mehrdad> it is called, firebug says so
[02:39:16] <Cork> mehrdad: does it error out when it gets to the apply call or what happens?
[02:40:10] <mehrdad> i am tracing it right now
[02:40:38] <mehrdad> let me test something
[02:42:25] <mehrdad> brb
[02:48:59] <elfrancesco> hello
[02:49:47] <elfrancesco> may someone give me some help with jquery.ui utilization with sharepoint (yes... i know...) ?
[02:52:48] <alaing> hey ppl
[02:53:26] <elfrancesco> my problem is i am getting an error message in firebug $("#myid").dialog() is not a function. I can run my script nicely locally but when inserted into a sharepoint webpart, it is not working...
[02:56:10] <alaing> I'm having an issue with datepickers and selecting a date. I have two versions of jQuery and jQuery UI being loaded onto the page.  When I select a date I get "inst is undefined" which I have narrowed down to line 9209 var inst = this._getInst(target[0]); which is returning undefined
[02:57:13] <alaing> elfrancesco: It sounds like jquery + jquery ui is not being loaded.
[02:57:48] <alaing> or you do not have and element with an id of "myid"
[02:58:23] <Wiz_KeeD> hey guys, what is the easiest way to have two select boxes that are connected to eachother meaning that the option in select box nr 1 has several choices in nr 2 and so on...basically displaying the right options for the selections in the first box?
[02:58:54] <Cork> Wiz_KeeD: multible selectboxes for nr2 and hide/show them based on nr1
[02:59:49] <elfrancesco> alaing: that's what i thought but for jquery just before calling my dialog function, i added a alert($().jquery) and i am getting the correct jquery version (1.7.1) but for jqueryui, indeed i have no dialog function defined (but the js file is included in my source just after the reference to jquery itself.
[03:00:05] <elfrancesco> my div is ok i really think its a jquery.ui import problem
[03:00:56] <Cork> elfrancesco: 1. is the jquery-ui js file loaded?
[03:01:03] <Ortund> assuming a change to a different browser isn't an option, what's the best way to fix jquery/ie compatibility problems?
[03:01:08] <Cork> 2. is $.ui.version undefined?
[03:01:12] <Cork> elfrancesco: ^
[03:01:13] <alaing> elfrancesco: try uploading it again. Try alert($.ui.version)
[03:01:31] <alaing> Cork haha beat me to it
[03:01:42] <Cork> Ortund: sucking it up and work around them
[03:01:46] <elfrancesco> $.ui.version undefined indeed
[03:01:57] <alaing> Cork: I'm having some issues with datepickers. could you help me?
[03:01:59] <Cork> Ortund: it hurts, but its the only "good" way
[03:02:04] <Wiz_KeeD> Cork, exactly, multiple select options not selectboxes
[03:02:04] <Wiz_KeeD> 2 selectboxes, for nr 2 hide/show options based on selection in nr1
[03:02:04] <Wiz_KeeD> i've been using css display: none and block and using classes that worked so and so...any suggestions?
[03:02:16] <iNerd> Hi. I'm having a problem selecting a class. I'm using 	$("div.rg-image").hover( … etc but it's not selecting anything
[03:02:28] <iNerd> if i use an ID it works, just not a class
[03:02:35] <alaing> elfrancesco: thats why you getting the error
[03:02:41] <Cork> Wiz_KeeD: ya, that should work
[03:02:44] <elfrancesco> i already tried uploading it again it is part of a sharepoint webpart. I am wondering if another webpart could be causing troubles into the import process of jquery.ui
[03:02:53] <alaing> elfrancesco: no jquery ui being loaded
[03:03:16] <Cork> elfrancesco: sounds like ex. something is overwriting jquery later in the game
[03:03:27] <alaing> elfrancesco: sorry I dont have any experience with sharepoint
[03:03:29] <Cork> elfrancesco: check so you don't have multibe jquery.js files included
[03:03:42] <alaing> I'm having an issue with datepickers and selecting a date. I have two versions of jQuery and jQuery UI being loaded onto the page.  When I select a date I get "inst is undefined" which I have narrowed down to line 9209 var inst = this._getInst(target[0]); which is returning undefined
[03:03:42] <Cork> sharepoint, and what else doesn't really matter
[03:03:54] <Cork> all that matters is whats on the client side
[03:04:23] <alaing> Cork I think I found a bug in UI
[03:04:46] <elfrancesco> Cork: my code is part of a webpart in sharepoint :( and each webpart register their own script so yes i have multiple references to jquery, colorbox (but afaik, only one ref to jquery.ui)
[03:04:48] <Cork> donno
[03:04:52] <boobo> Hello. In a article view, I have a sidebar "toolbox" with about 500 checkboxes.. what would be the best way to store this in db? json in a text field?
[03:05:08] <Cork> alaing: i stay LONG away from loading multibe version of jquery on a page, cause it usually cause a headace
[03:05:43] <Cork> elfrancesco: so one of the parts might be overwriting jquery after your loading jquery ui
[03:05:49] <alaing> Cork unfortunately its unavoidable due to my very restricted CMS
[03:06:04] <Cork> ya, been there done that
[03:06:08] <Cork> left :)
[03:06:28] <elfrancesco> Cork: are there ways for me to check when the overwritting process is happening ?
[03:07:03] <Cork> elfrancesco: load the page in a browser
[03:07:07] <Cork> open view source
[03:07:11] <Cork> look at the script tags
[03:07:16] <Cork> no better way
[03:07:18] <alaing> Cork have a look at this extract from UI http://pastebin.com/ted57Jyx
[03:07:31] <elfrancesco> u mean the last loaded the last overwritting ?
[03:07:44] <alaing> Cork the try/catch is not catching undefined
[03:08:08] <Cork> alaing: that doesn't sound right
[03:08:14] <Cork> undefined should throw
[03:08:27] <Lion31> how can I bind an event on accordion open? (I would like to trigger an ajax request when accordion gets opened)
[03:08:36] <Cork> alaing: and all throws should be tached by the catcher
[03:08:41] <Cork> rethrown though
[03:08:55] <alaing> exactly
[03:09:19] <alaing> but  When I select a date I get "inst is undefined" which I have narrowed down to line 9209 var inst = this._getInst(target[0]); which is returning undefined
[03:09:47] <parabellum> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/551318/ I need to send one more data with ajax from other input?
[03:09:58] <Cork> alaing: just cause lines in jquery crashes, its most of the time code that calls it that does the wrong
[03:09:58] <alaing> target[0] is returning the object
[03:10:13] <Cork> alaing: make sure that target is what its suppose to be
[03:10:50] <alaing> I'm console.loging it
[03:11:43] <alaing> the target exists
[03:12:02] <elfrancesco> Cork: if i can't remove other jquery refs, could i try using jquery.noconflict ?
[03:13:28] <xec_> hrm - i'm getting "object is null" line 630 in jquery-1.7.1.js -- are there any tools i can use to trace back to what script used the jquery function?
[03:14:18] <xec_> like, what the hell is calling jquery and sending it garbage :P
[03:14:18] <elfrancesco> brb thanks for your help
[03:14:31] <Ortund> can someone load homemation.co.za in IE8 and try to help me fix it? I've got no idea what's wrong there
[03:14:48] <alaing> How do I check/see what an elements .data is?
[03:15:26] <Lion31> how can I bind an event on accordion open? (I would like to trigger an ajax request when accordion gets opened).... this is how I bind on accordion header click...$( "#accordion_acquired_services .ui-accordion-header").click(function(event) .... but how to know if the accordion is expanded or collapsed?
[03:15:49] <xec_> alaing: $("element").data() ?
[03:15:51] * alaing welcomes his fellow saffa
[03:17:43] <xec_> i found it, i can tell firebug to "stop on all errors" and i get a stack trace
[03:17:59] * xec_ starts digging
[03:18:26] * alaing welcomes his fellow saffa Ortund
[03:18:42] <Lion31> PLEASE HELP
[03:20:39] <alaing> Lion31: are you using jQuery UI?
[03:21:52] <Lion31> sure
[03:23:00] <alaing> Lion31:  why are you using click?
[03:23:52] <Lion31> what else then?
[03:24:05] <Lion31> I don't find any suitable events in the api
[03:24:39] <alaing> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#event-changestart ?
[03:24:56] <Lion31> so what does that do?
[03:25:05] <Lion31> it starts on content change, right?
[03:25:31] <xec_> accordionchangestart fires every time the accordion starts to change, so yes
[03:26:04] <Lion31> so what good does this to me?
[03:26:15] <Lion31> what I'd like to achieve is to do an ajax request that would populate the accordion's content each time it is expanded...
[03:27:19] <Lion31> so after the request is finished and content is populated, than the changeStart is triggered... so I need something onExpand and onCollapse, and not onChange... since I need to trigger the change
[03:28:02] <xec_> Lion31: i'm not so sure this is very easy to do. might be better off creating your own
[03:28:43] <xec_> Lion31: on the other hand http://stackoverflow.com/questions/646415/jquery-accordion-and-loading-content-through-ajax
[03:29:46] <Lion31> ok, I am checking it out
[03:39:50] <Lion31> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9292585/jquery-accordion-oncollapse-and-onexpand-events/9292664#9292664
[03:41:36] <rktic> got similar trouble here, eventhough without ajax content. collapsible:true doesn't seem to work
[03:42:44] <rktic> jQuery(".accordion").tabs(".accordion div.pane",{tabs: 'h2', effect: 'slide', initialIndex: null, collapsible:true}); - why doesn't it work?
[03:43:45] <Lion31> rktic: couse you are setting options of accordion to a tab maybe?
[03:43:46] <xec_> rktic: youre putting tabs on an accordion?
[03:44:01] <rktic> yes
[03:44:09] <xec_> ?demo @ rktic
[03:44:09] <bot-t> rktic, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:44:14] <rktic> well, it's not my code though - came with the worpdress theme
[03:44:27] <rktic> so far it works fine however i can't get the tabs to collapse again
[03:44:56] <rktic> using it for the sidebar category navigation here: http://rp.euve3892.vserver.de/blog/
[03:45:00] <mehrdad> how do i get all items in an array via a single method? is there such a method?
[03:45:18] <mehrdad> couldn
[03:45:23] <mehrdad> couldn't find one here http://docs.jquery.com/Types#Array_Notation
[03:45:29] <xec_> get all items?
[03:45:35] <xec_> you mean loop through them?
[03:45:47] <xec_> or join them?
[03:47:23] <rktic> xec: does the url work?
[03:48:06] <xec_> yep
[03:48:31] <xec_> waiting for your instructions :)
[03:48:55] <rktic> well, i'm looking for a way to collapse open tabs again
[03:49:35] <rktic> and as far as i went through the code the accordion is being initialized with     jQuery(".accordion").tabs(".accordion div.pane",{tabs: 'h2', effect: 'slide', initialIndex: null});
[03:51:32] <rktic> went back and forth with the collapsible option but no luck so far
[03:51:34] <xec_> rktic: where are these tabs you speak of, and where is the code? what happens and what did you expect?
[03:51:44] <rktic> http://rp.euve3892.vserver.de/blog/
[03:51:53] <rktic> below "posts by subcategory"
[03:52:20] <xec_> ah i see it
[03:52:25] <rktic> i'd like them to be able to collapse again on click of an open item
[03:52:41] <meghdad> sorry the power cord was cut off
[03:52:52] <rktic> otherwise i'd have to retrict the length of the content to make it halfway usuable
[03:53:03] <mehrdad>  what is the method for getting all elements of an array?
[03:53:10] <xec_> rktic: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#collapsible
[03:53:26] <mehrdad> searching too
[03:54:01] <rktic> tried     jQuery(".accordion").tabs(".accordion div.pane",{tabs: 'h2', effect: 'slide', initialIndex: null, collapsible: true}); already
[03:54:11] <rktic> which has zero effect
[03:54:18] <xec_> mehrdad: what do you mean "get all the elements" ? do you want to loop through them? if to try $.each(arr, function...)
[03:54:25] <xec_> if so*
[03:54:41] <mehrdad> xec, well familiar with that approach
[03:54:50] <mehrdad> so no specific method, it is alright
[03:55:05] <xec_> rktic: but that is .tabs() not .accordion() ??
[03:55:11] <mehrdad> or something like python maybe? i doubt that tho
[03:55:28] <xec_> mehrdad: what is it you are trying to achieve
[03:55:31] <fof> you mean a for..each?
[03:55:36] <mehrdad> arr[0:]
[03:55:40] <fof> slices?
[03:55:46] <mehrdad> yes
[03:56:07] <rktic> xec: you mean it should be (".accordion', {collapsible:true}) or something like that?
[03:56:22] <mehrdad> brb
[03:56:47] <xec_> rktic: no, i mean it should be $(selector).accordion(options) rather than .tabs(etc...
[03:57:16] <rktic> hm, maybe i fiddle with the wrong function...
[03:57:29] <xec_> you think :)
[03:57:32] <rktic> (gneh, this theme framework lacks some proper documentation)
[03:57:46] <rktic> the dev offers all kinds of accordions and tabs
[03:57:59] * xec_ gets back to work
[03:58:09] <rktic> thx for your input!
[04:00:44] <ansh> hi guys
[04:01:29] <mehrdad> fof, no slices?
[04:01:44] <fof> huh
[04:01:49] <mehrdad> just regular for..each ?
[04:02:18] <fof> what do you want to do? select a subset? iterate?
[04:02:31] <xec_> mehrdad: we don't know what you want - you're saying you have a cake, and you want to know how you can get all the cake
[04:02:37] <mehrdad> as i said, iterate
[04:02:57] <mehrdad> all elements in an array using a simple syntax like python
[04:03:13] <mehrdad> in python arr[0:] gets all elements out of arr
[04:03:18] <fof> js isnt so pretty unfortunately
[04:03:31] <mehrdad> ok, that's all i wanted to know
[04:03:36] <mehrdad> going for foreach
[04:03:38] <mehrdad> thx
[04:04:08] <ansh> i m having problems with different browsers i am able to navigate through my html page in chrome and firefox but not in IE which gives me an  err in this code here http://pastebin.com/pE0Pf4nk
[04:04:15] <ansh> please help me
[04:05:31] <ansh> does jquery also behaves differently in all browsers
[04:05:33] <ansh> ?
[04:06:04] <shesek> jQuery makes an effort to gap the differences between browsers
[04:06:21] <shesek> but every browser is different and has its own quirks, its not a perfect solution
[04:06:38] <shesek> and much of it is up to you - adding jQuery to your page doesn't magically make everything that you write cross-browser
[04:07:26] <ansh> shesek : can u help me to find a better solution to my prob
[04:08:11] <shesek> not unless you try helping yourself first
[04:09:08] <shesek> ... and I'm just about to leave
[04:09:28] <ansh> i have tried my way
[04:09:35] <ansh> here is the jquery code in my page  http://pastebin.com/pE0Pf4nk ,it works fine in all browsers but in IE8 it gives err "Object doesn't support this property or method" metioned in line ERROR HERE
[04:10:11] <shesek> so look at that line, see what its trying to do, which method its trying to call and on which object
[04:10:30] <shesek> check the object contains what it should, google around for that method to see if it should exists, check if other people reported the same issues
[04:10:52] <blackspotwiggins> ansh, use one of already working plugins for placeholder
[04:10:54] <blackspotwiggins> happy ending
[04:11:10] <ansh> shesek : great thanks man
[04:17:44] <mehrdad> Cork, the array $.fn is empty at all :|
[04:17:57] <mehrdad> i was barking up the wrong tree (right?)
[04:18:00] <Cork> at all?
[04:18:11] <Cork> you mean its completly empty?
[04:18:14] <mehrdad> well, it is empty completely
[04:18:16] <mehrdad> yes
[04:18:31] <Cork> your sure $ is jquery?
[04:19:02] <Cork> cause ya. $.fn shouldn't be empty
[04:19:09] <mehrdad> it is a crapload of js libs jumbled together, dunno really where to edit
[04:19:54] <mehrdad> it is openlayers + geoengine + openerp + mapquery + loads of bullcrap
[04:20:14] <mehrdad> i am lost
[04:20:34] * mehrdad scratches his head out of despair
[04:21:06] <xec_> Cork: $.fn is the same as jQuery.prototype right?
[04:21:07] <mehrdad> let me set a breakpoint and see what the heck $ is
[04:21:14] <Cork> xec_: yes
[04:21:32] <Cork> mehrdad: try replacing $.fn with jQuery.fn
[04:21:38] <Cork> might be worth a shot
[04:21:55] <xec_> Cork: in firefox i do $.fn in console and get back an empty array..
[04:22:35] <xec_> and jQuery.prototype.length returns 0
[04:22:41] <Cork> xec_: in firebug?
[04:22:44] <xec_> ye
[04:22:54] <Cork> xec_: it overwrites $
[04:23:02] <Cork> and its not an array
[04:23:09] <Cork> its an object
[04:23:38] <Cork> Object.keys($.fn)
[04:24:00] <Cork> or Object.keys($.fn).length if you like
[04:24:25] <xec_> right
[04:24:48] <mehrdad> well i tried console.log($.fn); and came to that conclusion that is empty
[04:24:55] <mehrdad> wrong approach?
[04:25:02] <xec_> mehrdad: apparently
[04:25:07] <Cork> nope log does toString
[04:25:11] <Cork> so that should work
[04:25:23] <Cork> .length is the wrong approch though
[04:25:25] <mehrdad> sure!
[04:25:37] <mehrdad> that console prints tostring
[04:26:00] <mehrdad> tostring is great in every language
[04:26:06] <Cork> or rather i think it does toSource() actually
[04:26:30] <Cork> toStirng would only be "object"
[04:27:02] <xec_> TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'toSource'
[04:27:11] <xec_> hehe i love javascript errors
[04:27:17] <mehrdad> returns [] in console, as i said empty
[04:27:23] <mehrdad> going to try jquery.fn
[04:27:58] <xec_> Cork: firebug does (ofc) not overwrite $
[04:28:00] <Cork> mehrdad: thats sounds really broken
[04:28:10] <Cork> mehrdad: fn shoudn't be an array
[04:28:15] <Cork> so something is breaking it
[04:28:36] <Cork> its actually completly breaking jquery
[04:28:43] <xec_> Cork: and doing console.log(jQuery.fn) appears to return an empty array in both chrome console and firebug
[04:28:54] <mehrdad> xec, same
[04:29:19] <Cork> what version are you running?
[04:29:26] <mehrdad> is it an error o my part? i mean xec says the same
[04:29:26] <Cork> 1.4 and 1.7 doesn't for me
[04:29:32] <Cork> in either chrome or firefox
[04:29:40] <mehrdad> damn wth
[04:29:43] <mehrdad> let me check
[04:29:47] <xec_> doing typeof $.fn returns "object" and Object.keys($.fn) returns a list of all the functions
[04:29:48] <Cork> what does Object.keys($.fn).length say?
[04:30:05] <xec_> 150
[04:30:07] <mehrdad> xec, really
[04:30:15] <mehrdad> gonna test it out
[04:31:10] <mehrdad> same here, loads of functions
[04:31:20] <mehrdad> it looks like an array tho
[04:31:22] <mehrdad> wth
[04:32:09] <xec_> yes, Object.keys returns an array, of course
[04:32:15] <xec_> thats what it's supposed to do
[04:32:19] <blackspotwiggins> mehrdad, take out all js except jquery
[04:32:20] <mehrdad> what is the semantics of array in jq? is it different from others?
[04:32:26] <blackspotwiggins> and add one by one until it breaks
[04:32:29] <blackspotwiggins> problem solved
[04:32:44] <mehrdad> blackspotwiggins, no thanks
[04:32:54] <mehrdad> it is openerp i am working with
[04:33:02] <Cork> mehrdad: what the jquery object is, is a array like object
[04:33:04] <mehrdad> not a simple date picker in a static page
[04:33:06] <blackspotwiggins> good luck trying random shit then
[04:33:17] <Cork> mehrdad: fn is a noraml javascript prototype object though
[04:33:56] <Cork> mehrdad: so its basically var fn = {}; fn.function_name = value;
[04:34:38] <mehrdad> ah :/
[04:36:17] <shwaiil> hi
[04:36:41] <shwaiil> Q: $(selector).hover() sometimes is not triggered, how to solve ? Thanks for looking
[04:37:34] <Cork> shwaiil: generically like that, no its always triggered
[04:37:50] <Cork> the structure might cause thing to not happen, but its just an event listner
[04:38:20] <Cork> shwaiil: a code example for what fails for you is needed
[04:38:25] <shwaiil> Cork: tks for looking. "No, it's allways triggered" or "not allways triggered" ?
[04:38:51] <xec_> ?demo @ shwaiil
[04:38:52] <bot-t> shwaiil, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:38:54] <shwaiil> http://pastie.org/3387251
[04:39:01] <Cork> shwaiil: that means, hover doesn't fail, cause it just adds an event listner, the problem is somewhere else
[04:39:14] <shwaiil> using intervals
[04:39:31] <Cork> shwaiil: thats prob caused by async ness
[04:39:49] <Cork> an mouseout happens after a mouseover
[04:40:01] <Cork> so you stop the event right after it starts
[04:40:09] <Cork> (like the same msec)
[04:40:25] <shwaiil> hmmm :T
[04:40:26] <mehrdad> Cork, sooo there are many functions in the jQuery, but not the one u saw i added
[04:40:30] <Cork> especially when you trigger it on a class like that
[04:40:40] <shwaiil> Cork: what's the best practice then ?
[04:40:48] <shwaiil> use a variable to flag ?!
[04:40:52] <shwaiil> I ment... "lock"
[04:40:53] <Cork> mehrdad: so check that your code is run
[04:41:14] <mehrdad> i don't understand, i used the standard syntax to extend fn, didn't i?
[04:41:19] <Cork> shwaiil: useing interval is normally a bad idea
[04:41:24] <Cork> just for this reason
[04:41:30] <mehrdad> why is it not working is beyond me at this stage
[04:41:50] <Cork> cause you don't really know when the interval will trigger, and killing it might not do what you expect
[04:42:01] <shwaiil> Cork:  I see. I'm not seeing how to, do this without the interval
[04:42:09] <shwaiil> that's the problem
[04:42:55] * mehrdad gets back js crap pool
[04:43:17] <Cork> shwaiil: could try doing it as a setTimeout loop, and then setting a variable on the element ($(this).data) to trigger when the event should stop
[04:43:25] <Cork> shwaiil: thats the best thing i can think of
[04:43:40] <shwaiil> hmm
[04:43:42] <Cork> but ya, you will always through the code have to think about race conditions
[04:43:43] <shwaiil> thanks I'll take al ook
[04:43:58] <Cork> and its a hary beast
[04:46:34] <iman> mehrdad, cut your sound
[04:50:12] <mehrdad> iman, alright :|
[04:50:39] <alaing> jQuery UI: does a button need to be visible before I can call .button?
[04:50:54] <Cork> no
[04:51:26] <Cork> you can even do var new_button = $('<button/>').button(); parent.append(new_button);
[04:51:42] <alaing> strange
[04:51:53] <jQuy> yes, very
[04:51:57] <mehrdad> wth, it doesn't seem to get loaded, i'd bang my head against the wall if it proves to be the case
[04:52:04] <xec_> it is actually magic
[04:52:06] <mehrdad> jesus :-|
[04:53:09] <alaing> Cork: I have this http://pastebin.com/JpQvKDsG I get the alert but my button is not styled like jquery ui
[04:54:42] <Cork> alaing: can't tell why from that context
[04:54:56] <Cork> alaing: that should work, but it depends on when it runs
[04:55:46] <alaing> Cork I call it after jquery and jquery ui is loaded. it is in an external file
[04:56:11] <Cork> alaing: your calling it on domready or just when the file loads?
[04:56:29] <Cork> you need to wait for domready at least
[04:56:34] <Cork> else the button just doens't exist
[04:56:41] <iman> mehrdad, w'll kill you if you'll continue you singing
[04:56:42] <alaing> my body css is set to now and at the bottom of my page I run some jquery that sets the body to display:block
[04:56:45] <Cork> so no styling
[04:57:13] <alaing> so I should wrap that inside a .ready
[04:57:35] <mehrdad> iman is my coworker
[04:57:45] <Cork> alaing: depends what triggers the function your talking about
[04:57:56] <Cork> alaing: the context is everything
[04:58:13] <Cork> if the bottom of your body calls it, no you don't need to use .ready
[04:58:35] <Cork> alaing: if its called from somewhere inside the external js files global scope
[04:58:40] <Cork> yes you need to use .ready
[04:58:48] * alaing wishes he could have gone to jquk 2012
[04:59:02] <alaing> oh I see thanks Cork
[04:59:07] <jQuy> What design patterns are you using?
[04:59:22] <jQuy> I'm just interested
[05:00:01] * alaing wonders who jQuy is talking too
[05:00:30] <jQuy> I'm talking to all of you
[05:02:05] <cyberrog> hello. I have an array ["1", "2", "3"] and Im trying to get its values by position inside a for. When I try arr[0] it prints the whole array. Here is my code. http://jsfiddle.net/xZtcZ/3/
[05:02:38] <cyberrog> I mean. If I prit arr[0] it prints the whole array, not only the 0 position
[05:03:25] <xec_> cyberrog: it does not? http://jsfiddle.net/xZtcZ/4/
[05:03:39] <cyberrog> here is an update of my code.... http://jsfiddle.net/xZtcZ/3/
[05:03:45] <cyberrog> xec_ try inside a for
[05:04:08] <cyberrog> xec_ check this http://jsfiddle.net/xZtcZ/3/
[05:04:29] <jQuy> it's because you are looping the array
[05:04:32] <xec_> youre looping through the entire thing, printing out one part at a time
[05:04:40] <jQuy> There is a better way to define an array in javascript
[05:04:44] <xec_> resulting in printing out all of the array
[05:04:48] <jQuy> var arr = [];
[05:05:35] <cyberrog> xec_ IDK why but its not working on my program. When I try that it keeps printing the whole array
[05:05:45] <jQuy> and it's a good practice to chain the variables with comma like var a = "something", b = [], c = {};
[05:05:46] <xec_> cyberrog: and you pasted the same link three times
[05:06:10] <Cork> cyberrog: http://jsfiddle.net/xZtcZ/12/
[05:06:57] * Cork shivers a bit from the use of document.write...
[05:07:32] <cyberrog> Cork LOL. I tryied printing seats[i]+'<br/>' inside the for and it printed seat_06 A,seat_07 A,seat_08 A,seat_09 A,seat_05 A,seat_04 A,seat_03 A,seat_02 A,seat_01 A,<br/>
[05:07:39] <cyberrog> See?? IDK whats happening to id.
[05:07:41] <cyberrog> it*
[05:08:22] <Cork> sounds like you might have had the array as a string or something
[05:08:39] <cyberrog> maybe
[05:09:02] <cyberrog> Cork but when I print the array it logs an object. Thats weid
[05:09:04] <jQuy> cyberrog: var i, arr = ["item1", "item2", "item3"]; for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) { document.write(arr[i]); }
[05:09:05] <cyberrog> weird*
[05:10:00] <cyberrog> when I print it, it prints an object with 10 positions
[05:10:06] <alaing> grr for the live of me i cant remember how you condition set your variable value i.e like a default. var l_variable = if value  then 1 else 0
[05:11:15] <xec_> var i = true ? "true" : "false"; <-- ternary?
[05:11:26] <jQuy> alaing: var l_variable = value ? 1 : 0;
[05:12:37] <arkascha> Coming from oo programming I currently do my first project that involves jquery.
[05:12:57] <yannickoo> hey guys, how can i sort the json by votes descending? http://jsfiddle.net/yKtgg/2/
[05:13:00] <arkascha> For three days I try to make sense from hundreds of examples to fins a simple and elegant notation, but I fail.
[05:13:07] <xec_> arkascha: how confused are you on a scale from 1 to 10 ?
[05:13:20] <arkascha> xec_: :-) I'd say 7.
[05:13:26] <arkascha> now my question:
[05:13:38] <alaing> thanks xec_  and jQuy
[05:14:19] <arkascha> since chaining animations using callbacks is so annoying and difficult to read I thought about wrapping html elements into jquery objects to compose own animation methods.
[05:14:46] <blackspotwiggins> arkascha, use deferreds
[05:14:56] <blackspotwiggins> it's slightly more readable
[05:15:01] <arkascha> I had the hope that I could then use these methods mixed with the normal jquery animations.
[05:15:14] <arkascha> I tried to use deferreds, but I gave up.
[05:15:27] <arkascha> The examples are cunfusion, since they all state different things :-(
[05:15:51] <arkascha> Maybe someone has an easy example for someone little talented as me ?
[05:16:12] <xec_> arkascha: have you seen this? http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/02/merging-jquery-deferreds-and-animate
[05:16:29] <kez> hi all
[05:16:38] <arkascha> xec_: no, I will look into that one, thanks.
[05:17:34] <blackspotwiggins> arkascha, if you are animating only one element, you can just chain them
[05:17:41] <blackspotwiggins> .animate().animate().animate()
[05:17:48] <arkascha> xec_: introductioon looks like what I am looking for, at least they mention the same problems I experienced.
[05:18:01] <kez> is there any method withing the $.ajax call that I can use in order to grab the DOM element that generated the ajax call ?
[05:18:11] <kez> specifically onSuccess
[05:18:28] <xec_> arkascha: for lower level understanding of javascript, coming from classical languages, this is a good read: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript
[05:18:30] <arkascha> blackspotwiggins: there are 2 or 3 elements involved.
[05:18:33] <Cork> kez: dom elements doens't generate $.ajax calls
[05:18:39] <Cork> kez: so no
[05:18:45] <xec_> not really relevant to your question but ;)
[05:18:59] <xec_> i wish i had that link when i was starting out
[05:19:03] <kez> what I mean is I've got an DOM element binded with an ajax event
[05:19:22] <kez> like I click this link and an ajax request is lunched
[05:19:57] <Cork> kez: you mean like .ajaxComplete?
[05:21:07] <kez> <a href="#" id="some-link" onclick="$.ajax(blabla , success => function(data) {HERE IS WHERE I NEED THE href element} />
[05:21:23] <Cork> kez: thats onclick
[05:21:27] <xec_> my eyes
[05:21:31] <Cork> its not the dom element doing it
[05:21:37] <Cork> its just javascript
[05:22:08] <Cork> kez: when you run code in inline events it just means it runs in the global js scope
[05:22:13] <jQuy> yannickoo: http://jsfiddle.net/yKtgg/6/
[05:22:14] <triptec> I've got problems setting vertical position on ui-dialog help?
[05:22:48] <Cork> kez: if you bind the event with a normal event listner, you can use the this variable though
[05:22:50] <arkascha> xec_: why is doing a simple animated web-micro-bit that complicated in jquery ?
[05:22:58] <Cork> kez: thats not posible in the global scope though
[05:23:01] <arkascha> xec_: the link you gave me first explains how to bend jquery to be usable.
[05:23:04] <arkascha> great.
[05:23:12] <jQuy> yannickoo: did that help you?
[05:23:21] <xec_> arkascha: did you see blackspotwiggins' comment? about chaining
[05:23:22] <cyberrog> WOW!! I found out that the array wasnt an array but a matrix! Thats why when I was printing [0] it printed the whole array, now [0][0] prints the value I want; Thats weird.
[05:23:40] <arkascha> xec_: yes, and I replied that there are 2 to 3 elements involved.
[05:23:56] <arkascha> is it really impossible to write that dpown in a simple function ?
[05:23:56] <cyberrog> OR NOT!
[05:24:11] <Cork> cyberrog: multi dimentional array...
[05:24:26] <xec_> arkascha: usually not - could you make a quick demo of what you're doing so far?
[05:24:29] <kez> ok thanks Cork
[05:24:32] <xec_> ?demo @ arkascha
[05:24:35] <bot-t> arkascha, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:24:56] <arkascha> xec_: obviously I cannot make a demo, since none of my attempts work :-)
[05:25:01] <cyberrog> Cork correct.
[05:25:10] <arkascha> all I want is to:
[05:25:11] <xec_> arkascha: i thought you got it working by nesting callbacks
[05:25:13] <fof> i dont understand what could be so unreadable about chaining and anonymous functions :)
[05:25:33] <arkascha> xec_: parts of it, yes. But it is horrible to read.
[05:25:36] <Cork> cyberrog: from what you said it sounds more like an array with a string in
[05:25:44] <arkascha> and then obviously even more horrible to maintain or extend.
[05:25:51] <arkascha> This is not what I chose jquery for.
[05:26:46] <xec_> arkascha: you can chain animations on multiple elements easily, really; http://jsfiddle.net/CBYNL/
[05:27:51] <xec_> arkascha: or if you dont want to chain http://jsfiddle.net/CBYNL/1/
[05:27:54] <arkascha> xec_: I want to define a function animating a few elements, and I want to be able to use that function, chain it like one of the original jquery animations.
[05:28:15] <xec_> arkascha: you can make a small plugin
[05:28:41] <shwaiil> Q: When doing something like $(foo).animate({ opacity: $(this) } can we use $(this) as $(foo) ? will that work ? Tks
[05:29:03] <arkascha> xec_: one plugin for each element in the web site I want to be able to handle ?
[05:29:11] <arkascha> that cannot be the idea behind plugins.
[05:29:23] <xec_> arkascha: no, for each set of animations, for reuse
[05:29:23] <blackspotwiggins> shwaiil, if you previously declared var foo = this
[05:29:37] <zfmf> i want have the first two rows red, next two rows white, then again two red, and so on, is tehre another method for this or can i do it with nth-child
[05:29:50] <shwaiil> blackspotwiggins: ahh ok :) I thought I could just grab this on that context
[05:29:53] <arkascha> xec_: there is no reuse on other sites, so I dont see a sense in a plugin.
[05:29:53] <shwaiil> .animate :X
[05:30:07] <blackspotwiggins> shwaiil, you are not creating a new scope
[05:30:16] <xec_> arkascha: then i'm not sure what you're doing
[05:30:25] <arkascha> xec_: sorry, but I dont see the point behind the examples you gave me.
[05:30:27] <shwaiil> blackspotwiggins: ok thanks for letting me know :)
[05:30:56] <xec_> arkascha: they are doing multiple animations on multiple elements without callbacks
[05:31:22] <xec_> arkascha: which i thought was what you were after, maybe i misunderstood what you're after
[05:32:08] <xec_> arkascha: and the way i would do reuse of a set of animations would be something like this http://jsfiddle.net/CBYNL/3/
[05:34:12] <arkascha> xec_: ok, thanks, seems to go into the direction. I will have to play around with it.
[05:34:28] <arkascha> xec_: I tried things that way, but failed.
[05:34:55] <arkascha> xec_: maybe because I did some syntax or logical mistake somewhere and the dynamic nature of this stuff swallowed it.
[05:35:41] <arkascha> xec_: I just had the faint hope that finally the web would have a way to make a decent gui instead of everyone fiddling around :-)
[05:37:50] <xec_> arkascha: maybe in the next version of the web, i hear 3.0 is right round the corner ;D
[05:37:53] <arkascha> xec_: in your last example, is there a way to stick the awesome animation method to some specific object instead of having to keep them all global ?
[05:38:18] <arkascha> xec_: yes, lol. Probably it will become even more horrible than what people nowadays for some reason call 2.0.
[05:39:08] <arkascha> xec_: back to my question: I want to define a jquery object for each composed element on my page, say different dialogs containing several html elemnts.
[05:39:11] <xec_> arkascha: plugins are not global really, but attached to the global jquery object
[05:39:29] <arkascha> xec_: I want to stick animation methods to some of those objects.
[05:39:42] <arkascha> xec_: and I want to keep those objects in some hierarchy.
[05:40:34] <arkascha> xec_: perfect would be something like this: $..desktop.Controls.DlgAdd.activate();  which would do a couple of things, close other elements, open the referred dialog and bind functions to buttons.
[05:41:24] <xec_> well, of course you can just define your own object and attach whatever you like to it, which has nothing to do with jquery really
[05:41:48] <arkascha> xec_: I have nothing against these ("my") objects being defined inside jquery.
[05:41:56] <arkascha> xec_: I just want things to work and to be readable.
[05:43:27] <xec_> arkascha: maybe something like this can help you http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth
[05:43:31] <arkascha> xec_: ah, sorry, my fault: the "$..desktop" was not meant specific, but as a fuzzy notation.
[05:43:38] <zfmf> how can i do this with jquery? http://officeimg.vo.msecnd.net/en-us/files/861/372/ZA001035918.gif is there an easy way :D
[05:44:17] <arkascha> xec_: I dont really care how I can address these objects. But whatever hierarchical structure I try to define I get 'undefined' problems somewhere.
[05:44:46] <xec_> arkascha: i would have to see your code in action in order to guess what might be causing that
[05:44:56] <arkascha> xec_: I guess I simply lok for something jquery isnt designed to offer :-)
[05:45:30] <xec_> arkascha: yeah, jQuery does not do much to help structure an application
[05:45:59] <xec_> arkascha: you could take a look at knockout.js for instance, if you're familiar with MVC pattern
[05:46:00] <fof> alternating row styles? http://www.google.es/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=jquery+alternating+row+style
[05:46:11] <fof> (zfmf)
[05:46:48] <MACscr> anyone know how to add a class to a <button> if a form isnt validating? im using the validate() plugin and validation is done after each input field and id like to have it so that if an error shows, it styles the submit button differently. Right now prevents the form from submitting and shows the error, but id like to change that button as well. Any suggestions?
[05:47:13] <xec_> zfmf: look up nth child selector
[05:52:22] <reyn> Hi, I'm using knockout (and knockout-repeat) for data binding. I'm adding elements to the dom that should become new tabs. Unfortunatelly jquery-ui doesnt pick up the changes and calling .tabs() again doesnt work. Is there any alternative ? thanks
[05:55:38] <zfmf> fof:  xec_: thanks, but my problem is i want always for  two lines the same color, i tryed with nthchild but it is coloring only one line
[05:59:20] <sylock> hello guys. I'm new with jquery. I'm trying to add dynamically a class named "active" so the css would highlight my active menu. I give to the function the argument "this". When debuging, if I display the argument received by the function I get an "undefined". I don't understand why. here is the code : http://dpaste.com/703487/
[05:59:44] <sylock> is someone have an idea?
[05:59:51] <xec_> zfmf: how about ":nth-child(4n+1):nth-child(4n+2)"
[06:00:09] <xec_> err there should be a comma there
[06:00:15] <minna> Hi, how do i temporarely replace a text with another text?
[06:00:17] <xec_> zfmf: ":nth-child(4n+1), :nth-child(4n+2)"
[06:00:45] <zykes> hmm, how can i get the error json data in a jquery ajax request ?
[06:01:19] <xec_> .fail(function(data){...}) ?
[06:02:26] <zykes> it's in a "error"
[06:02:32] <zykes> error: function(...) {}
[06:02:52] <xec_> okay, that should work too
[06:03:13] <xec_> error: function(data) { console.log(data); }
[06:04:03] <arkascha> xec_: one more question, if that's ok.
[06:04:06] <arkascha> xec_: http://paste.opensuse.org/48091149
[06:04:06] <john-dev> is it possible to change a background-image using jquery ui animate?
[06:04:39] <arkascha> why do I get a "function statement requires a name" at "Notification: function(obj)" ?
[06:05:09] <shwaiil> Q: When adding a new node el, is it possible to have a specific style already ? It's because, nested in a <el parent> I have a img that z-index 5 and a <div z-index10> this last one is added and removed accordingly. when it's added, well <img> is hover it
[06:05:11] <shwaiil> Any tip ?
[06:05:15] <zykes> xec_: i thought it was error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {} ?
[06:06:03] <xec_> arkascha: umm, not sure :)
[06:06:19] * arkascha wobbles.
[06:06:27] <xec_> arkascha: but you should always put the { on the right hand side in javascript
[06:06:53] <xec_> arkascha: there's this nasty thing called a semicolon insertion that can cause headaches
[06:07:42] <xec_> arkascha: and, are all these methods supposed to act as contstructors?
[06:07:44] <xec_> -t
[06:08:20] <arkascha> xec_: yes, I specifically want constructors. I want to construct objects, as written.
[06:08:33] <arkascha> I thought I could directly construct objects and add methods in javascript.
[06:08:51] <arkascha> Without defining classes frist. But I tend to mangle both approaches...
[06:09:10] <xec_> it looks quite messy to me
[06:09:23] <arkascha> xec_: it cetainly is, simply typed down.
[06:09:31] <elfrancesco_> hi
[06:09:42] <arkascha> wanted to handle coding mistakes later, but I even stumble at that very first place.
[06:10:39] <elfrancesco_> is there a way to force a javascript to load after another (be appended in the last line of the header) i am using sharepoint and my webpart doesn't load correctly cause there is another webpart overwritting jquery...
[06:10:49] <xec_> zykes: ah, you're right
[06:11:16] <xec_> arkascha: did you read the module pattern link i gave you?
[06:12:15] <zykes> xec_: how do i do that then ?
[06:15:48] <xec_> not sure, did you inspect the objects you get passed?
[06:17:31] <elfrancesco_> i am using sharepoint and my webpart doesn't load correctly cause there is another webpart overwritting jquery...Is there a way to force a javascript to load after another (be appended in the last line of the header)  ?
[06:19:57] <gyzmodo> hello guys
[06:20:48] <gyzmodo> i would like to officialy add a new language to the jQueryUI Datepicker, how can do it?
[06:24:15] <microhxo> I am using the Autocomplete plugin and i would like to know how i can get the id of the textbox that triggered onAutocompleteSelect ??  Here is my code: http://paste2.org/p/1904928  I know it is hooked on #FirstNameQuery but i want to expand this so that i can have multiple textboxes autocompleting and i'd like to have it figure out which textbox requested it in the onAutocompleteSelect
[06:25:11] <zykes> xec_: how can i do that ?
[06:25:27] <microhxo> I tried this inside of onAutocompleteSelect: var filter = $(this);    switch (filter.attr('id')) {   ...  But filter just ends up being the window..
[06:25:59] <xec_> zykes: just console.log them and look at them in your debugger of choice
[06:26:13] <gyzmodo> any ideas?
[06:31:13] <Ghan> i have a li and in that li i have a ul. I want to show the nested ul when the li is clicked
[06:31:20] <Ghan> so far so good
[06:31:31] <Ghan> now i have multiple of those things
[06:31:54] <Ghan>  jQuery("#click").click(function() {
[06:31:54] <Ghan>     	jQuery(this).children('ul').toggle();
[06:31:54] <Ghan>     });
[06:32:10] <Ghan> only toggles the first set of li > ul
[06:32:40] <xec_> ?demo @ Ghan
[06:32:41] <bot-t> Ghan, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:33:49] <zfmf> xec_: thanks it worked ;)
[06:34:57] <xec_> yw :)
[06:35:39] <g[r]eek> Hey fellas. I am conducting an ajax call. My alert before the ajax call shows up, but my alert inside of my ajax call's success function doesn't. How can I debug this to establish where my code is breaking? Thanks
[06:36:22] <aqeel> hi room
[06:36:23] <xec_> g[r]eek: any errors in console? can you see the http request?
[06:36:39] <aqeel> how can i alternately float my li...
[06:36:45] <Ghan> http://jsfiddle.net/xRzPr/
[06:36:53] <Ghan> the second clickme won't toggle
[06:37:04] <aqeel> 1,3,5,7,...float left........2,4,6............float right
[06:37:12] <xec_> Ghan: ID's are unique
[06:37:18] <aqeel> li...1,2,3,4,5,6....
[06:37:25] <xec_> Ghan: use a class instead if you want it to appear multiple times
[06:37:31] <fof> elements can share a class though
[06:37:37] <microhxo> Anyone?
[06:37:39] <microhxo> I am using the Autocomplete plugin and i would like to know how i can get the id of the textbox that triggered onAutocompleteSelect ??  Here is my code: http://paste2.org/p/1904928  I know it is hooked on #FirstNameQuery but i want to expand this so that i can have multiple textboxes autocompleting and i'd like to have it figure out which textbox requested it in the onAutocompleteSelect
[06:37:49] <g[r]eek> xec I'm tailing apache's error.log and nothing shows up there
[06:37:53] <xec_> Ghan: http://jsfiddle.net/xRzPr/1/
[06:37:54] <Ghan> xec_: OMG!
[06:37:57] <Ghan> that simple!
[06:37:59] <g[r]eek> xec_ see above comment
[06:38:06] <Ghan> thnx!
[06:38:53] <xec_> aqeel: can you post your markup? see ?demo
[06:38:54] <bot-t> aqeel, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:39:15] <xec_> g[r]eek: how about in your javascript console - any errors?
[06:39:28] <g[r]eek> xec_ javascript console? How do I view that?
[06:39:38] <xec_> g[r]eek: what browser?
[06:39:43] <g[r]eek> firefo
[06:39:55] <xec_> g[r]eek: install firebug if you dont have it
[06:39:59] <g[r]eek> ok thanks
[06:40:20] <aqeel> i have with css float left..and it works as required but i want half float left and half float right
[06:40:44] <xec_> aqeel: you can do that by setting width on each li and their container
[06:40:54] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com\advance.html
[06:41:08] <aqeel> yes tha is what i did
[06:41:24] <aqeel> but half should float left and half should float right
[06:41:36] <xec_> aqeel: just float all of them left
[06:41:47] <aqeel> but it will not center...
[06:41:47] <xec_> aqeel: and set their width to half of their container
[06:41:56] <xec_> center the container
[06:42:06] <aqeel> i did like that...can see in my site link
[06:42:20] <aqeel> sorry let me upload tyhe latest one
[06:42:46] <Ghan> http://jsfiddle.net/xRzPr/
[06:42:53] <xec_> aqeel: but this is a css question really, don't need jquery
[06:43:02] <g[r]eek> xec_ thanks so much the firebug console immediately pointed out the error
[06:43:06] <Ghan> how can i make the other ones collapse if i press the other one?
[06:43:07] <g[r]eek> cheers
[06:43:13] <xec_> g[r]eek: :)
[06:43:26] <xec_> Ghan: i already gave you the answer
[06:43:50] <xec_> Ghan: and you posted the exact same link again
[06:44:08] <aqeel> ok....refresh browser...
[06:44:31] <xec_> aqeel: make a jsfiddle please
[06:44:39] <donCams> zup
[06:44:48] <xec_> aqeel: i can't see any list on that page
[06:45:00] <aqeel> hover over mm
[06:47:12] <aqeel> can u see......refresh please.....and have a look
[06:47:28] <xec_> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/s5KWH/
[06:48:06] <xec_> aqeel: centered http://jsfiddle.net/s5KWH/1/
[06:48:43] <Ghan> http://jsfiddle.net/xRzPr/2/ : how can i make the other list toggle hide if i toggle a list?
[06:49:16] <xec_> Ghan: you only want one open at a time? or what do you mean
[06:49:25] <Ghan> xec_: yes
[06:49:27] <Ghan> exactly
[06:49:51] <aqeel> but if i have border, and padding/margin...it get distorted
[06:50:20] <aqeel> that is why i want to keep the space in center if somehow need to shift a bit
[06:50:53] <aqeel> so float left and float right ....balance space in between the two
[06:51:04] <Ghan> aqeel: link?
[06:51:14] <xec_> Ghan: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/xRzPr/3/

[07:01:31] <chee> do you really
[07:01:39] <xec_> sorry, I posted that twice didn't I
[07:03:17] <chee> xec_: amazingly i didn't see it either time

[07:03:39] <xec_> chee: i feel ignored =( *sits in a corner*
[07:03:52] <xec_> hehe
[07:03:57] <chee> aqeel: maybe you just want something like this http://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/
[07:04:03] <aqeel> u r being of help.....xec
[07:04:26] <aqeel> it is not i want something like box model but have it properly propotioned
[07:05:05] <xec_> aqeel: can you make a drawing of what you want, i'm not sure i get it
[07:05:46] <xec_> i love it when people have the same level of mspaint-fu as me
[07:05:53] <xec_> only pencil tool allowed
[07:05:54] <aqeel> any site where i can show ...
[07:07:50] <xec_> aqeel: yes. plenty :)
[07:08:13] <xec_> i can google it with bing for you if you like
[07:08:14] <aqeel> i will try to explain in detail........say i have width of 48%, on li and float all of them right...the distance from ul to li on left is less than the distance from ul to li on right side
[07:08:35] <aqeel> sorry float all of them to left*
[07:08:53] <xec_> aqeel: http://letmegooglethatwithbingforyou.com/?q=image%20sharing%20service
[07:09:18] <Ghan> lol letmegooglethatforyou is cool
[07:09:35] <xec_> heheh, the bing results are appalling
[07:09:53] <microhxo> I am using the Autocomplete plugin and i would like to know how i can get the id of the textbox that triggered onAutocompleteSelect ??

[07:10:24] <xec_> microhxo: could you make it a live demo instead? jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net are both nice
[07:10:55] <xec_> usually you can just do something like this.id
[07:13:23] <microhxo> xec_ this ends up being "Window" and not my textbox.
[07:16:29] <xec_> microhxo: maybe inspect the event object, see if you can find the target there
[07:16:57] <xec_> it's usually suppliad as the first argument
[07:18:45] <hlve`workaholic> hey dudes, what kind of encryption would be using '[]['\x63\x6f\'
[07:18:48] <hlve`workaholic> that kind of crap
[07:19:10] <Gradinko> hi all, having a bit of trouble here. I'm trying to focus on a text input and NOT highlight the text in that input
[07:19:32] <Gradinko> focus seems to select all, but i want the user to be able to begin typing at the end of the input. Anyone know how to achieve this?
[07:19:58] <izepstan> jquery.find doesn't work in tables?
[07:20:47] <Jon47> izepstan it does
[07:33:03] <gho5t> hey now
[07:33:13] <gho5t> is there a better way to accomplish this simple snippet http://jsfiddle.net/AfT2v/
[07:33:24] <gho5t> just looking to use as little code as possible
[07:33:58] <johnkpaul> gho5t: you can put the text "test" into your original $("<a></a>")
[07:34:10] <gho5t> yeah true
[07:34:21] <Gradinko> can alsu use live intead of document.ready
[07:34:27] <gho5t> I read online it's better to use jquery instead
[07:34:33] <gho5t> of adding the html in there
[07:34:42] <gho5t> use live instead of document.ready?
[07:34:56] <Gradinko> sec, i'll make ya a new one
[07:35:00] <johnkpaul> $("#btn").live("click"
[07:35:09] <johnkpaul> and then you don't need the docuemnt.ready wrapper
[07:35:12] <gho5t> oh really
[07:35:14] <gho5t> didn't know that
[07:35:33] <Gradinko> also you want to use live in case buttons get added to the dom by other javascript for any reason
[07:35:36] <johnkpaul> although I think the recommendation is to use on() for all event handlers now
[07:35:37] <izepstan> ca i affect an object if parent is display:none?
[07:35:38] <Gradinko> then the event still fires
[07:35:45] <gho5t> yeah
[07:35:48] <Gradinko> johnkpaul: yeah your'e correct there
[07:35:54] <johnkpaul> izepstan: what do you mean "effect"?
[07:35:57] <Gradinko> habit i'm still working on breaking myself
[07:36:00] <gho5t> one thing I was surprised about was that i couldnt' just do .append
[07:36:03] <johnkpaul> Gradinko: yeah, me too, definitely
[07:36:07] <johnkpaul> I'm so used to live and delegate
[07:36:08] <gho5t> one sec i'll make an example
[07:36:11] <johnkpaul> but I'll get there
[07:36:39] <xec_> Gradinko: maybe this can help https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Input.setSelectionRange
[07:36:40] <izepstan> "affect" f.e. hide a div which is already in a hidden div
[07:36:55] <izepstan> or alter a checkbox under a hidden div
[07:37:20] <gho5t> johnkpaul: Gradinko http://jsfiddle.net/AfT2v/1/
[07:37:21] <izepstan> or get these elements excluded from jquery selector?
[07:37:26] <gho5t> how would I get that to work correctly
[07:37:53] <gho5t> while still using .text
[07:38:01] <johnkpaul> izepstan: you _want_ to exclude them?
[07:38:05] <johnkpaul> I think there's a :visible selector
[07:38:10] <johnkpaul> but that might be an extension
[07:38:47] <domcat> hello, any ideas what can cause this problem in IE8 and less? http://d.pr/NhIm
[07:38:54] <izepstan> johnkpaul no include, they get excluded naturaly
[07:39:09] <izepstan> dont know why
[07:39:37] <gho5t> izepstan: my guess is yes since it will still exist in the dom
[07:40:08] <johnkpaul> izepstan: can I have an example of that? I've never seen that behavior, just because something is hidden, doesn't mean jQUery won't select it
[07:40:25] <johnkpaul> gho5t: http://jsfiddle.net/AfT2v/2/ is my first throught
[07:40:28] <johnkpaul> but you can change live to on
[07:40:28] <izepstan> ok i make a fiddle
[07:40:31] <SPYGAME> is there a way with which i can pass a value dynamically from outside of an event ??
[07:40:36] <johnkpaul> but I haven't memorized that yet
[07:40:37] <Gradinko> gho5t: http://jsfiddle.net/rmASg/
[07:41:09] <gho5t> Gradinko: yeah that will work the .text(0
[07:41:15] <gho5t> but what if i wanted a click function
[07:41:24] <gho5t> I just want to know how to get that idea working
[07:41:49] <gho5t> unless I need to stick with the original format I had
[07:43:59] <gnagno> hello all
[07:44:17] <gnagno> I am having an issue with jquery-ui is there a specific channel for it or I should ask here?
[07:45:08] <izepstan> johnkpaul, ok the thing is, if i hide a div under a hidden div, and then, show the parent, the child will be shown as long as i dont click anywhere, if i click somewhere the view gets refreshed somehow and the div disappears...
[07:45:14] <izepstan> is this a common problem?
[07:45:44] <xec_> gnagno: fire away
[07:46:34] <izepstan> ok no thats wrong
[07:46:36] <izepstan> moment
[07:46:37] <johnkpaul> izepstan: that's a very confusing description, but I'm sure it's a confusing problem, please send a fiddle and we can try to gigure it out
[07:46:46] <cyprox> Hi
[07:47:08] <fof> gho5t: this any good? http://jsfiddle.net/NsMDV/1/
[07:47:09] <cyprox> is there a workaround to parse HTML tags from a XML document in a Ajax call?
[07:47:17] <Whirl3d> what is the best html5 video fallback solution currently?
[07:47:23] <gnagno> simply, I am trying to use a slider from jquery-ui, but looks like I can't register for the slide callback, here is my code :http://pastie.org/3388288
[07:47:24] <gianiaz> Hi, in a script I want to load html from another domain and search in it some urls using jquery selectors
[07:47:49] <gianiaz> I think I have problems from cross-site.. .there's a workaraound?
[07:48:46] <sphinxxx> gianiaz: not possible unless you use php
[07:49:00] <sphinxxx> you can only get jsonp cross domain, if the foreign site provides it
[07:49:14] <gianiaz> ok
[07:49:15] <fotoflo> hey all. I'm using $.Callbacks() and i find myself wanting to use it in the global context most of the time: document.callbacks = $cal
[07:49:23] <sphinxxx> unless you have access to this other domain, then you could configure it to access cross domain requests
[07:49:28] <xec_> ?demo @ gnagno
[07:49:29] <bot-t> gnagno, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:49:29] <fotoflo> document.callbacks = $.Callbacks()
[07:49:42] <gianiaz> sphinxxx, I was sure that with $.get I could do it
[07:49:45] <fotoflo> do i need to do it this way, or is there a better way?
[07:50:03] <gianiaz> there are a lot of tutorials for creating an rss reader using $.get
[07:50:42] <gho5t> Is there any difference in the way these 2 operate: $(".filters", $this); $this.find(".filters") ?
[07:51:12] <sphinxxx> gianiaz: you can't get html cross domain
[07:51:22] <sphinxxx> unless the server allows it
[07:51:28] <gianiaz> thank you sphinxxx :-)
[07:51:35] <xec_> gho5t: they should be equivalent, but iirc .find() is the preferred way
[07:51:56] <sphinxxx> find is faster
[07:52:02] <johnkpaul> xec_: there is some performance diference
[07:52:07] <xec_> gho5t: of course, $this could be a DOM element and still work in the first form and not the latter
[07:52:16] <johnkpaul> http://paulirish.com/2009/perf/
[07:52:18] <johnkpaul> slide #30
[07:52:43] <cyprox> hello, is there a workaround from reading html tags from a xml doc?
[07:52:52] <cyprox> *for
[07:53:05] <NoiseEee> workaround?
[07:53:09] <gho5t> thanks!
[07:53:53] <cyprox> how can I do it without using the .html() ?
[07:54:01] <xec_> johnkpaul: that's not quite the same
[07:54:39] <sphinxxx> cyprox: query treats xml just like a regular DOM
[07:54:40] <johnkpaul> xec_: oh, you're right
[07:54:41] <xec_> johnkpaul: gho5t was using the second "context" parameter
[07:54:44] <johnkpaul> that's for descending from id
[07:54:46] <sphinxxx> jquery&
[07:54:48] <sphinxxx> **
[07:54:49] <xec_> ye
[07:54:52] <johnkpaul> yeah, but there's article about that too from paulirish
[07:54:52] <gnagno> can someone please help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/vPCDe/
[07:54:56] <johnkpaul> I remember reading it
[07:55:01] <xec_> i'm sure there is :D
[07:55:20] <domcat> any ideas what can be problematic if I pass an ID to function that I want to use as $(myID + ' .class).dosomething() … if I use that multiple times it not works in IE8 properly
[07:55:25] <cyprox> sphinxxx but how can I grab the html content of the doc?
[07:55:40] <sphinxxx> gnagno:  what exactly are you trying to do?
[07:55:48] <cyprox> since the .html() does not work
[07:55:54] <sphinxxx> cyprox:  load it through $.ajax
[07:56:00] <sphinxxx> and then do .html() on it
[07:56:07] <gnagno> sphinxxx, I would just like to make my slider work
[07:56:08] <johnkpaul> xec_: there's this - http://jsperf.com/jquery-find-vs-context-sel but it's not what I was thinking of either
[07:56:32] <gnagno> sphinxxx, actually in my page it is working, on jsfiddle it is not working (i think because there's no css)
[07:56:37] <johnkpaul> how do people keep track of their bookmarks
[07:56:39] <cyprox> that's what I'm doing sphinxxx ! But the method .html() doesn's work with XML doc
[07:56:41] <johnkpaul> so they can easily lookup things like this
[07:56:50] <sphinxxx> cyprox:  can you make a jsfiddle for it and i'll look?
[07:56:59] <cyprox> sphinxxx sure! wait a sec.
[07:57:20] <xec_> johnkpaul: i actually add masses of keywords to my bookmarks, in firefox
[07:57:30] <sphinxxx> johnkpaul: theres lots of ways, depends how ocd you want to be with it
[07:57:48] <johnkpaul> I want to be as OCD as possible, with as much laziness as possible
[07:57:49] <juho3> Can I ask jqueryui-related questions here?
[07:57:57] <xec_> johnkpaul: but, of course, i never bookmark the sites i actually want to refer to later
[07:58:01] <johnkpaul> I want my bookmarks to be downloaded and full text indexed :D
[07:58:19] <johnkpaul> xec_: yeah, that's probably my problem right now, I bookmark a lot and either not what I need or have no way of finding it
[07:58:22] <sphinxxx> gnagno:  you haven't defined "slide" anywhere
[07:58:37] <sphinxxx> is that a plugin?
[07:58:40] <johnkpaul> juho3: you can, I think ther'es also #jqueryui, but just ask don't ask to ask
[07:58:42] <sphinxxx> slider i mean
[07:59:01] <gnagno> sphinxxx, slider is from jqueryui
[07:59:10] <sphinxxx> oh ok
[07:59:17] <gnagno> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#default
[08:00:27] <cyprox> sphinxxx http://jsfiddle.net/aascensao/sDhjh/
[08:01:00] <xec_> gnagno: http://jsfiddle.net/vPCDe/4/
[08:01:10] <sphinxxx> gnagno:  I'm not sure if jsfiddle includes the jquery ui css
[08:01:36] <xec_> it doesnt, unfortunately, you need to add it under resources like i did in my link there
[08:01:58] <jeffreylevesque> seen pachet?
[08:03:13] <sphinxxx> cyprox: try it like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/sDhjh/1/
[08:04:20] <juho3> Okay so I want to create a page where you can drag an image onto a div and I'd like it to snap onto a 50x50 grid, but instead of moving the image there i'd like it to be copied there. Here's the thing so far http://haaveri.org/
[08:04:24] <juho3> oops
[08:04:31] <juho3> not there
[08:04:42] <juho3> http://haaveri.org/~juho3/testing
[08:05:41] <gnagno> xec_, I copied and pasted it in my script on my computer and it is not working....
[08:05:56] <xec_> gnagno: any errors in console?
[08:06:03] <gnagno> xec_, the slider is being displayed, but the result div is still empty
[08:06:06] <gnagno> no error
[08:06:34] <xec_> gnagno: did you open the console before you refreshed the page
[08:07:13] <xec_> sorry if i'm asking stupid questions, but you did copypaste working code and made it not work :P
[08:07:29] <gnagno> xec_, there's no stupid question :)
[08:07:41] <gnagno> xec_, yes the console is open and I don't get any error in it
[08:07:43] <johnkpaul> juho3: I think it's called clone
[08:07:46] <johnkpaul> the property that you need
[08:08:57] <cyprox> sphinxxx returns null!
[08:09:12] <xec_> ?eval sphinxxx
[08:09:13] <bot-t> xec_: ReferenceError: sphinxxx is not defined
[08:09:22] <xec_> :D
[08:09:30] <sphinxxx> lol
[08:09:49] <cyprox> :)
[08:10:11] <sphinxxx> cyprox: are you sure its pulling the xml file? (check the network tab of your browser for a 200 response)
[08:10:47] <juho3> johnkpaul: yeah I figured that much
[08:10:53] <juho3> just not sure where and  how to apply it
[08:10:55] <xec_> gnagno: well, maybe check versions, are jquery core and ui the same version as the jsfiddle?
[08:11:11] <gnagno> yes
[08:11:12] <johnkpaul> juho3: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2458817/jquery-ui-drag-and-clone-from-original-div-but-keep-clones
[08:11:22] <xec_> gnagno: check if jQuery === $
[08:12:09] <sphinxxx> juho3: do the same thing as you're doing now, except clone the img element first
[08:12:57] <gnagno> xec_, is it possible the problem is because of the css theme?
[08:13:07] <sphinxxx> juho3:  var $clone = $('#originalimage').clone(true0;
[08:13:10] <xec_> gnagno: doubt it
[08:13:13] <sphinxxx> .clone(true);
[08:13:20] <juho3> sphinxxx: try refreshing the page now
[08:13:23] <xec_> gnagno: but it sure is worth a shot
[08:13:35] <juho3> now the problem is that it doesn't snap into the correct place right away
[08:13:38] <cyprox> sphinxxx yes. positive.
[08:13:40] <juho3> it does it on the second drag
[08:13:42] <juho3> o_o
[08:14:23] <sphinxxx> cyprox: do you have it live on a site i can look at it?
[08:14:27] <cyprox> sure
[08:17:54] <xarxer> Is there any pre-defined function in jQuery to convert HTML-code to specialchars?
[08:18:26] <johnkpaul> xarxer: special chars?
[08:18:34] <johnkpaul> xmlencoded? urlencoded?
[08:18:44] <xarxer> like < is converted to &lt;
[08:19:05] <johnkpaul> I'm pretty sure that's the global escape() in browsers
[08:19:22] <juho3> sphinxxx: did you have a peek at it_
[08:20:14] <shomon> hi, how do I check that a field has an alphanumeric value in jquery?
[08:20:57] <cyprox> xarxer use escape()
[08:21:33] <xarxer> cyprox: okay! thanks!
[08:21:36] <cyprox> ups sorry johnkpaul, didn't notice your reply
[08:22:07] <Foxhoundz> Crazy question
[08:22:45] <Foxhoundz> Why doesn't jQuery allow users to download and use specific 'modules' from jQuery. I.E., jQuery without the effect tools. I just need it for AJAX.
[08:22:59] <johnkpaul> juho3: I think that the order of your cloning isn't working, you clone after it's already moved, but there's only one #snaptarget
[08:23:27] <johnkpaul> Foxhoundz: I think you can http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/08/building-a-slimmer-jquery/
[08:23:36] <johnkpaul> oh no, that's not the right link
[08:23:38] <johnkpaul> damn it bookmarks
[08:24:14] <juho3> johnkpaul: I actually noticed the same thing like a minute before you said it. It gets the name elementti-clone after it's dropped, and it only snaps into the grid when it's named elementti-clone
[08:24:36] <juho3> I think I'm pretty close to solving the issue..
[08:25:29] <jsdumb> What does a helper option do in draggable function?
[08:29:45] <rathis> I have some elements using compound class names (.button blue, .button red, etc.).  I want to select any element that starts with ".button".  How do I do this?
[08:31:04] <ajpiano> ?attributeStartsWith
[08:31:04] <bot-t> [attribute^="value"]: Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value beginning exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[08:32:09] <rathis> thanks.
[08:32:50] <Foxhoundz> johnkpaul: did you find that link?
[08:32:57] <ajpiano> Foxhoundz: you can't.
[08:33:13] <Foxhoundz> ajpiano: :(
[08:33:16] <johnkpaul> Foxhoundz: no I didn't. I was looking for a tutorial that explained how to build it yourself with ant
[08:33:17] <ajpiano> Foxhoundz: we have some pretty tight dependencies that go back to the early days of jquery, etc
[08:33:25] <johnkpaul> oh, then mayeb not
[08:33:33] <ajpiano> we are working on the stuff johnkpaul linked to in that blog post
[08:33:48] <ajpiano> and some folks have done some research to prove its possible to tease it apart into modules
[08:34:13] <ajpiano> but having a modular, buildable jquery hasn't been a high priority for us compared to, say, a dead code removal system
[08:34:58] <Foxhoundz> I see
[08:40:52] <ChristianAdamski> Hi, if I have nodes of class "main" which additionally have classes "add1" or "add2" or "add3"... how could I .each() through those subclasses without knowing how many there are?
[08:41:59] <robert`> ok i'm getting confused by this behaviour .. dunno if anyone can help me
[08:42:18] <robert`> If I create two separate elements using $('<div></div>')
[08:42:28] <robert`> and then do $.contains(elem1, elem2) it returns true
[08:42:35] <robert`> Why?
[08:42:57] <imsky> awwww yeeah
[08:43:28] <gho5t> is this legal: $filters.is(":visible")
[08:45:27] <johnkpaul> robert`: I don't know why, but it makes snese from the source
[08:45:28] <johnkpaul> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.contains
[08:45:34] <johnkpaul> a !== b is true
[08:45:43] <johnkpaul> and there is no a.contains
[08:46:57] <robert`> oh
[08:46:58] <robert`> hahaha
[08:47:06] <robert`> that seems like a bug to me
[08:47:17] <robert`> but you're right, I can see how it's happening from teh source
[08:48:55] <johnkpaul> yeah, I'd expect the end of that ternary to be false
[08:50:00] <johnkpaul> gho5t: yes, the syntax is fine
[08:50:10] <johnkpaul> as long as you have the :visible extension
[08:51:31] <robert`> ok thanks john, i've submitted a bug report
[08:51:37] <robert`> will come up with a workaround in the meantime
[08:54:04] <johnkpaul> no problem robert`
[08:58:58] <juho3> So anyone got any idea how I
[08:59:02] <juho3> ack shitty keyboard
[09:00:34] <juho3> anyone got any idea how i could get the element i'm dragging and dropping to snap onto the correct place on the grid right away after being dropped, at the moment it snaps onto the grid after being dropped, then dragged again; here's a demo http://haaveri.org/~juho3/testing
[09:06:27] <jgornick> Hey guys, are there any plans to actually deprecate delegate/undelegate and bind/unbind?
[09:06:45] <ajpiano> jgornick: i think they're very unlikely to ever be removed
[09:07:05] <jgornick> ajpiano: Thanks!
[09:07:24] <ajpiano> and in the event they were, punching in the compat layer for those would be relatively simple anyway
[09:07:59] <jgornick> ajpiano: Totally.
[09:09:03] <gnagno> I have a question about jqueryui method draggable, I saw there's an option containment, I can pass an array of values in the form  [x1, y1, x2, y2], does this mean that the top left corner of my element will not be able to get out of this box?
[09:16:27] <gnagno> can I get the x and y positions of an element in my page relative to the top left corner of the document?
[09:17:34] <NET||abuse> hi guys,, have a weird one, inheritied some code on a site, using jqueyr validate, $.validator.addMethod("SortCode", function(v,e,p){   then in the code there's a line  if(window.event.type='submit'){   but firefox and i think IE (don't have a debugger for IE) both don't have window.event defined,
[09:18:27] <NET||abuse> this function obviously isn't itself an event handler so no way to add a method param to include event, how do i work around it in this case?
[09:34:54] <silur> Hello
[09:35:30] <silur> Is it possible with jQuery: programmatically submit data via ajax + crossdomain + secure (https) + POST + be able to receive json response?
[09:35:53] <silur> So far i only found the way to do it via GET
[09:39:40] <miket3> test
[09:40:15] <miket3> anybidy got jeditable with databasles working?   I am killing myself tryingto get it together
[09:40:28] <adardesign> quick question,
[09:40:28] <adardesign> why doesn't $.ajax with dataType:"script" behave like $.getScript
[09:40:58] <fof> yes miket3, using php?
[09:41:07] <miket3> fof, yes
[09:41:24] <adardesign> $.ajax with dataType:"script" only downloads the js file but doesnt excute
[09:41:31] <miket3> i got this working a couple years back.. but i cant even get my example to work
[09:41:44] <miket3> no errors
[09:41:50] <miket3> just nothing happens....
[09:41:57] <fof> weird, should be straightforward as long as your php code is working
[09:42:02] <JaMz-> any help im new in jquery... http://jsfiddle.net/hamCa/1/
[09:42:05] <miket3> i will paste my code
[09:42:27] <JaMz-> i want to run the code if is there any "pre-selected" option like in that case...
[09:43:36] <miket3> fof, does the php code have to be valid just to get the editable field in the browser?
[09:45:00] <nsfmc> i'm almost certainly missing something, but for jquery ui droppables, is there a function on it to query all objects on it after its drop event?
[09:46:33] <JaMz-> http://jsfiddle.net/hamCa/2/
[09:50:38] <sphinxxx> JaMz-: could you explain more
[09:50:50] <sphinxxx> there will always be a selection, because you're running the code on the change event
[09:51:24] <adardesign> can anyone see my message here? (i am new here)
[09:51:32] <st4lk3r> y
[09:51:43] <byebyebyezzz> is there a way that I can remove a css element?
[09:51:51] <adardesign> st4lk3r did you answer me?
[09:51:56] <byebyebyezzz> I use .animate on an image to change height and width
[09:51:58] <byebyebyezzz> and it adds
[09:52:07] <byebyebyezzz> display: inline-block;
[09:52:12] <byebyebyezzz> I dont want that
[09:52:21] <byebyebyezzz> I tried to change display to none
[09:52:30] <byebyebyezzz> but it doesnt solve the problem completely
[09:52:45] <byebyebyezzz> anyway  I can remove display: inline-block?
[09:52:50] <sphinxxx> byebyebyezzz: do you have a jsfiddle made?
[09:53:03] <JaMz-> sphinxxx: I'm trying to change the ".selection" to another trigger so if there is alerady a selected option run the code, else, wait for the change...
[09:53:59] <adardesign> can anyone explain why
[09:53:59] <adardesign> $.ajax with dataType:"script" only downloads the js file but doesn't execute (still need to eval)
[09:53:59] <adardesign> and $.getScript downloads and executes.
[09:54:00] <adardesign>  
[09:54:35] <JaMz-> sphinxxx: i mean to change the ".change" to another thing...
[09:54:54] <sphinxxx> JaMz-:  I'm still confused
[09:55:05] <sphinxxx> the code you have is fine
[09:55:39] <JaMz-> sphinxxx: I know, and it works... but it only works on a change... so i have to use the dropbox... but what if there is a preselected option...
[09:55:39] <adardesign> JaMz, also checked that fiddle, looks good
[09:56:15] <sphinxxx> JaMz-: then just run the code on dom ready or load event
[09:56:23] <JaMz-> over there there is a preselected item... but it doesnt run the code because the ".change"
[09:56:59] <adardesign> you can have a $("#select1").trigger("change")
[09:59:52] <putsgrilla> http://dpaste.com/703575/

[10:00:10] <JaMz-> i just want to validate if is there something selected if no, then run the code...
[10:00:24] <JaMz-> also if there is a ".change
[10:01:56] <methoddk> putsgrilla: whats the problem
[10:02:00] <JaMz-> something like...
[10:02:02] <byebyebyezzz> anyway I can remove the css display: block ? I dont want to change it to display: none. I want to remove it
[10:02:36] <putsgrilla> methoddk:  i need to get the value of the variable "pos" when mouse moves on "#quadro"
[10:02:40] <methoddk> putsgrilla: you can't access that variable because its in another function

[10:28:46] <LukeNukem> ok, when i put the results inside a div, it works but puts the entire effing page inside the div and its ugly..how can i make only the javascript output from the function show?
[10:28:56] <pcperini> anyone have any ideas as to why jQuery would be returning empty lists all of the time? http://jsfiddle.net/8TvFc/
[10:29:12] <Karolis> I'm doing an A/B test and using jQuery to change the logo to a smaller one and making the header shorter. The changes are visible during the loading of the page. It's possible to see the old logo before it's changed to the new one. Is there a way to avoid this problem?
[10:29:25] <xec> LukeNukem: i'm ignoring you until you can demonstrate what's going on :)
[10:29:25] <LukeNukem> i do this on success $('#emptydiv').html(data);
[10:29:46] <LukeNukem> http://117.199.8.48/register.php
[10:30:29] <xec> LukeNukem: url not work
[10:30:39] <sphinxxx> Karolis: yes :)
[10:30:58] <Karolis> also, apparently it's only happening in Firefox
[10:30:59] <xec> sphinxxx++
[10:31:03] <LukeNukem> what error?
[10:31:11] <sphinxxx> Karolis:  can you make a jsfiddle ill show you how you can avoid the flash
[10:31:13] <xec> LukeNukem: can't connect
[10:32:35] <ranjithtenz> @xec i have container div where i drag and drop few text and edit it using content-editable after it is done i wanted to convert it into pdf/image without any change of postion
[10:32:38] <xec> pcperini: you're missing a ) at the end of your docready function
[10:32:54] <Karolis> spinxxx, the entire thing is kind of long, how much of it do you need?
[10:33:10] <sphinxxx> just copy and paste it?
[10:33:38] <pcperini> xec: fixed. was a typo, and not the problem source :) thanks though
[10:34:42] <xec> pcperini: http://jsfiddle.net/8TvFc/2/
[10:35:25] <ranjithtenz> this is what i done so far http://178.79.189.111/startdesign/
[10:35:48] <LukeNukem> xec, ok try the url now
[10:35:57] <LukeNukem> http://117.199.8.48/register.php
[10:36:15] <xec> same error
[10:36:34] <LukeNukem> FUU
[10:36:42] <sphinxxx> Karolis: i have to go in a few min
[10:36:54] <pcperini> xec: ok, it looks like jsfiddle isn't carrying the error over, so it must be somewhere else. i'll keep digging through my code
[10:36:55] <LukeNukem> can you tell me on success how to make ajax show only javascript instead of entire html
[10:37:42] <xec> pcperini: maybe you're trying to select something that doesn't exist in DOM yet, or maybe $ isn't jQuery? be sure to check your console for errors
[10:38:01] <pcperini> will do. thanks
[10:39:30] <xec> LukeNukem: you're better off doing that serverside
[10:40:20] <xec> LukeNukem: or else you would need to parse the entire result clientside, which is alot of unnessecary overhead
[10:40:35] <xec> -s+c
[10:40:45] <DarkSector> xec: done :) http://jsfiddle.net/AyxWz/
[10:41:23] <xec> DarkSector: this is a css issue. you know what specificity is?
[10:41:35] <DarkSector> xec: What/
[10:41:36] <DarkSector> ?
[10:42:09] <DarkSector> Are you saying I should be specific in pointing out css?
[10:43:12] <xec> DarkSector: it means you override the .on {} rule with an ID earlier in the css
[10:43:28] <xec> DarkSector: http://jsfiddle.net/AyxWz/1/ <-- slapped an !important on it to demonstrate
[10:43:35] <JaMz-> how i get a POST value from a form in JS
[10:43:50] <JaMz-> like $_POST["value"] of php ?
[10:44:12] <xec> JaMz-: you don't send HTTP POST to javascript
[10:44:21] <xec> JaMz-: so i'm not sure what you mean
[10:45:13] <DarkSector> xec: sorry, I don't understand, could you explain it a bit more?
[10:45:27] <xec> DarkSector: without the !important : http://jsfiddle.net/AyxWz/3/
[10:46:01] <xec> DarkSector: a css rule specified with an ID takes precedence over a css selector with a class
[10:46:11] <DarkSector> oh!
[10:47:02] <JaMz-> xec: i have a form and trought it it sends a value... a suc_id... in method POST... how do i get that value ?

[10:47:17] <DarkSector> need to read up
[10:47:19] <DarkSector> thanks xec
[10:48:11] <xec> JaMz-: you have a html form, with an input field named suc_id ?
[10:48:20] <JaMz-> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/hamCa/11/    <---- the var id2. obviusly its undefined because it is set when you do a change on var id1
[10:48:56] <JaMz-> xec: yes its an html form with a dropbox named suc_id
[10:49:05] <JaMz-> dropdownbox
[10:49:17] <xec> JaMz-: in that demo you have var id2 = $("#select2") but there is nothing in the html with that ID
[10:50:05] <JaMz-> xechttp://jsfiddle.net/hamCa/12/
[10:50:33] <JaMz-> i just add the second "id=#select2" dropdown box...
[10:50:36] <miket3> damn typo
[10:50:38] <JaMz-> it take it from there...
[10:51:16] <xec> JaMz-: ok. and what was the issue? you wanted to get what?
[10:53:05] <xec> JaMz-: just fixed a typo in the html & indentation: http://jsfiddle.net/hamCa/13/

[11:02:24] <key2> hi
[11:03:15] <rathis> I need to center-align the text of a select form.  These custom selects, written in jquery, are center-aligned.  http://sugaslide.github.com/jQuery-UI-select-menu/
[11:03:42] <rathis> However, I still want to use the native select.  Does anyone know how I can do this?
[11:03:53] <key2> if I do var foo = $(<p>foo</p>).appendTo("#bar");
[11:04:01] <key2> how can I remove foo now
[11:04:02] <key2> ?
[11:04:52] <key2> since $(foo).remove(); doesnt seam to remove the <p> from the DOM
[11:05:29] <rathis> $(<p>foo</p>).remove(); ?
[11:05:29] <xec> rathis: styling of native select boxes is very limited, i don't think you can center text inside them
[11:05:58] <xec> key2: how about foo.remove();
[11:06:03] <rathis> xec: Agh.  This UI looks pretty bad when it's not center aligned.
[11:06:12] <key2> xec: nop, doestn work
[11:07:10] <xec> rathis: you can always try css text-align: center; though
[11:07:22] <rathis> xec: Yeah, that didn't work.
[11:07:35] <xec> rathis: did you put on the select element?
[11:07:43] <rathis> xec: Yes.
[11:07:59] <rathis> xec: It just seems like such an obvious and simple thing to have.
[11:08:54] <xec> rathis: http://tinkerbin.com/kReQhDQI
[11:09:28] <rathis> xec: That's center-aligned for you?
[11:10:15] <xec> rathis; in ff, yes
[11:10:26] <xec> key2: http://jsfiddle.net/fScfK/
[11:10:45] <xec> key2: this makes for a silly demo of course, seeing as it doesnt display anything... hehe
[11:11:03] <xec> key2: but comment out the remove and you see the paragraph there :)
[11:12:14] <rathis> xec: Ahh, guess webkit doesn't support text-align.  Unfortunate.
[11:12:50] <xec> rathis: IE9 didn't like it either
[11:12:58] <xec> worth a shot though
[11:13:23] <JaMz-> xec: the select2 is populated from and onchange in the select1
[11:13:46] <xec> JaMz-_ ok
[11:13:48] <JaMz-> so when document ready there isnt a true value on select2 field...
[11:14:12] <xec> so don't try to cache its value on dom ready
[11:14:26] <ferik> hi all. Quick question on event bubbling & such. I have a number of elements within an href. The href carries data through data-issue="234" for example. In the click event, I'd like to get to that data but the target I get is whatever HTML element I click on within the href. What's the best way for me to get the HREF? The click event is on the href through a "live".
[11:14:43] <WebDragon> there's a word for the feeling you're having when you're experiencing two wholly divergent viewpoints simultaneously
[11:14:49] <JaMz-> yeah.. thats why im tring to get it from the POST of the form... but i dont know how to
[11:14:52] <WebDragon> onea them four-dolla college words like
[11:14:55] <someprimetime> i was asking in #javascript what twitter uses for maintaining the position/content after paginating tweets using their infinite scroll and someone mentioned localStorage/sessionStorage but aside from this and hashing the url.. are there other methods in js to maintain that state?
[11:15:04] <WebDragon> can't remember what it is. it's not dichotomy, or schism
[11:15:14] <JaMz-> also i cant "mix" php inside this javascript rihgt?
[11:15:15] <WebDragon> it's more an psychological term I think
[11:15:18] <WebDragon> s/an/a/
[11:15:52] <WebDragon> anyone know offhand? I realize this may be a bad place to ask, but then, it's a roomful of highly intelligent people who might know
[11:16:43] <WebDragon> JaMz-: you can embed php inside javascript if done carefully
[11:16:50] <someprimetime> WebDragon: i believe they call that a religious experience
[11:16:56] <JaMz-> xec: something like var id2 = \""<?php echo $suc_id; ?> "\";
[11:16:59] <WebDragon> put the js inside a <script tag inside a .php file
[11:17:00] <someprimetime> :p
[11:17:04] <WebDragon> someprimetime: LOL no
[11:17:11] <WebDragon> but nicely put hahaha
[11:17:19] <WebDragon> almost worth tossing that one at bash.org
[11:17:21] <someprimetime> cognitive dissonance
[11:17:26] <WebDragon> someprimetime: THAT'S it
[11:17:30] <WebDragon> thank you!
[11:17:34] <someprimetime> np
[11:17:35] * WebDragon slides the carafe of DragonCoffee™ over to someprimetime 
[11:17:42] * someprimetime takes sip
[11:17:45] <someprimetime> DECAF?!
[11:17:49] <WebDragon> cheers mate. couldn't for the life of me dredge that term up outta my memory
[11:17:52] <WebDragon> HELL no
[11:17:57] <xec> lol
[11:18:04] <JaMz-> $("#select2").load('generaselect.php?id='+id+'&suc_id='PUT_PHP_HERE);
[11:18:36] <WebDragon> carafe - An open-topped glass flask typically used for serving wine or water
[11:18:40] <WebDragon> not decaf
[11:18:45] * WebDragon shudders visibly
[11:18:52] <xec> JaMz-: theres no point in sending to php something you get from php
[11:18:52] <ibike365> hey all
[11:19:20] <JaMz-> $("#select2").load('generaselect.php?id='+id+'&suc_id=\"" <?php echo $suc_id;  ?>"\"');
[11:19:23] <JaMz-> its that ok ?
[11:19:35] <WebDragon> xec: you can use php to obtain some value from the server that you then pass to jquery for use
[11:19:46] <someprimetime> haha yeah i'm drinking some decent guatemalan  coffee atm
[11:19:48] <WebDragon> I've had to do it on occasion
[11:19:56] <ibike365> mmm coffee
[11:20:02] <WebDragon> someprimetime: hehehe got some Ethiopian Yrgacheffe (aka ZOMG) over here
[11:20:07] <xec> WebDragon: yeah but look at that code, he's passing it directly in a ajax request
[11:20:15] <someprimetime> nice ++
[11:20:19] <DMASS> Can anyone recomend a good tutorial for debugging XML parsing errors?
[11:20:30] <WebDragon> xec: agh,I missed that, being distracted by the coffee talk :D
[11:20:34] <JaMz-> WebDragon: this is my occasion...
[11:20:55] <WebDragon> all I can say, JaMz- is TIAS
[11:21:00] <someprimetime> JaMz-: yeah in order to have that value from php you're going to have to first call a controller (depending on what framework you are using if you are using one) to get that value and then do your request
[11:21:09] <xec> JaMz-: i think your issue is doing something at the wrong time in js
[11:21:14] <someprimetime> unless i'm totally missing the point
[11:21:16] <WebDragon> DMASS: aside from having an XMLLint parser around ?
[11:22:46] <xec> JaMz-: try thinking about *when* something is going to happen, like after you have filled out the second select and then hit submit?
[11:22:54] <DMASS> WebDragon: ya Im sorry, Ill be more specific, XMLParsing errors related to $.parseXML
[11:23:02] <JaMz-> xec: i think the same i have to do it before document ready... but the second select doesnt work until you make a change...
[11:23:13] <xec> ?demo @ DMASS
[11:23:14] <bot-t> DMASS, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:23:30] <nVee> Hey there, is there a jquery function which can force a integer to 2 decimal values
[11:23:32] <nVee> ?
[11:23:33] <JaMz-> and you doesnt selec from the second dropdown until you submit the form...
[11:23:34] <WebDragon> DMASS: ah
[11:23:37] <xec> JaMz-: surely, you're not doing ajax immediately 'on doc ready?
[11:24:15] <WebDragon> nVee: aside from some form of sprintf ?
[11:24:36] <JaMz-> no. im doing ajax on change....... but you dotn select an item until you submit the form
[11:25:13] <xec> JaMz-: that doesnt make sense - why would you submit a form that you're not finished creating?
[11:25:25] <nVee> WebDragon: I want to force an integer (when assigning it to a new variable) to have 2 decimals
[11:25:49] <nVee> so I have example a = 0; b = a;
[11:25:56] <WebDragon> sounds like a job for sprintf to me
[11:25:59] <BauerUK> anyone aware of a jquery/jqui plugin that will allow a user to select a hotkey and converting it to a jquery.hotkeys accepted string? (e.g. "alt+f", "shift+e", etc.)
[11:26:20] <WebDragon> does ECMAScript have a sprintf? I've never had occasion to check
[11:26:32] <JaMz-> xec: you do the first select... then it populate the second dropdown.. then you select from there and send the form... when it come back i want to the secod select to be selected...
[11:26:50] <snover> WebDragon: no.
[11:27:07] <BauerUK> WebDragon: nope. but phpjs has an implementation of it, if you want to have a look: http://phpjs.org/functions/sprintf:522
[11:27:09] <snover> WebDragon: string.replace works fine though.
[11:27:10] <xec> JaMz-: you are sending back a form after your submit?
[11:27:28] <snover> BauerUK: did you really just non-ironically link to phpjs? really?
[11:27:30] <JaMz-> yup...
[11:27:47] <BauerUK> snover: did you really just suggest string.replace as an alternative to sprintf? ;)
[11:28:01] <JaMz-> xec: so it generate a char... with data from the first select and the second one...
[11:28:08] <WebDragon> there you go, nVee
[11:28:12] <xec> JaMz-: a char?
[11:28:19] <JaMz-> chart*
[11:28:59] <xec> ok. if you are reloading the entire page anyway, you should generate the complete form (with select options preselected) on server
[11:29:25] <JaMz-> so it select data from company "select1" and from the store "select2"... so i want to save that values and return it as selected....
[11:29:50] <Eviltwin> Guys, I miss JavaScript and jQuery so much right now
[11:29:58] <Eviltwin> I'm forced to work in Java Swing
[11:30:26] <M4d3L1> $("frmProductCompare").product_id.attr('disabled', 'disabled'); why this not work?
[11:30:36] <JaMz-> xec: thats what im trying to do... the problem is that the second dropdown "select2" is generated by the ajax... so, i have to send the value in the doc.ready
[11:30:37] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: would you then call yourself a "swinger"
[11:30:45] <xec> JaMz-: what? why
[11:30:59] <M4d3L1> if I do $("frmProductCompare").product_id.value = "222" it work
[11:31:06] <someprimetime> going from language to language. no regard for monogamy
[11:31:10] <someprimetime> how dare you
[11:31:17] <xec> Eviltwin: surely, JavaScript is almost the same as Java - just look at the names!
[11:31:43] <WebDragon> Eviltwin: *silently passes the carafe of DragonCoffee™ and a triple shot of brandy to be mixed into the coffee in whatever portions you desire*
[11:31:53] <JaMz-> xec: thats why im trying to "var id2=" but it doesnt work... so thats why im tryin to embed some php code inside the script...
[11:32:26] <xec> JaMz-: at what stage is this supposed to happen?
[11:32:38] <JaMz-> xec: because i already have the second select "after first formsend" in a POST method...
[11:32:50] <someprimetime> JaMz-: do you have a demo of this?
[11:32:55] <xec> JaMz-: you lost me again
[11:33:05] <JaMz-> sure...
[11:33:17] <WebDragon> go go gadget jsfiddle
[11:33:32] <JaMz-> http://www.prueba.esmindustries.com/reporteador/
[11:33:33] <someprimetime> WebDragon: if it decides it wants to load
[11:33:35] <JaMz-> admin/12345
[11:33:45] <JaMz-> admin//12345
[11:33:48] <someprimetime> i'd so pay for the guarantee that jsfiddle would work consistently or at least 99.9% of the time
[11:34:08] <someprimetime> is this safe for me to be logging into? i don't want to break anything
[11:34:10] <JaMz-> if you select the first in the second field it save it... but not for the thirdone...
[11:34:17] <someprimetime> hopefully this is your dev server
[11:34:29] <xec> someprimetime: i hope so, i'm clicking everything i find
[11:34:49] <someprimetime> lol… JaMz- the actual day in the date picker?
[11:35:02] <someprimetime> No puede ser mayor su fecha inicial.
[11:35:07] <someprimetime> something about the mayor not being good
[11:35:20] <someprimetime> that's what i got when i tried to save it
[11:35:31] <xec> lol
[11:35:39] <JaMz-> use december dates
[11:35:47] <xec> i think it's got something to do with eating feces?
[11:35:51] <JaMz-> theres nothing on jan or feb
[11:35:59] <ferik> When an HREF contains multiple elements, how do you get that HREF in the click event instead of on of it child?
[11:36:20] <someprimetime> xec: ah, right. the mayor is eating feces so he can't process your request at the moment
[11:36:25] <someprimetime> JaMz-: nothing for december
[11:36:57] <someprimetime> http://i.imgur.com/KQcDg.png
[11:37:12] <someprimetime> i filled the date out like that and pressed enter
[11:37:12] <JaMz-> december and also chose something from the sencodn and third select boxes of the right... after that hit sumbit, send, enviar
[11:37:16] <xec> ferik: try event.currentTarget
[11:37:25] <someprimetime> so this is just plotting the coordinates
[11:37:33] <M4d3L1> why if I do $("frmProductCompare").page.remove(); it work on every navigator except on IE8?
[11:38:08] <xec> M4d3L1: what is that .page thing
[11:38:15] <M4d3L1> hidden input
[11:38:22] <xec> wha
[11:38:25] <ferik> xec: will try that, thank you
[11:38:30] <xec> ?demo @ M4d3L1
[11:38:30] <bot-t> M4d3L1, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:38:49] <ferik> xec: that works, thanks much!
[11:39:02] <JaMz-> someprimetime: did you see...
[11:39:19] <someprimetime> JaMz-: it's still processing the request
[11:39:20] <JaMz-> someprimetime: if you chose something from second, it populates the third...
[11:39:25] <xec> ferik: yw :)
[11:39:46] <someprimetime> JaMz-: it did not do that for me
[11:39:52] <someprimetime> and now you have an internal server error 500
[11:39:52] <JaMz-> someprimetime: when it returns it clean the request of the third, dropdown....
[11:40:03] <JaMz-> use one day only... is faster...
[11:40:10] <mattp_> whats the easiest way to take the first 3 elements found by a selector
[11:40:13] <mattp_> is there a selector for it?
[11:40:35] <xec> ?slice @ mattp_

[11:40:51] <mattp_> thats what im lookin for. thanks :)
[11:41:25] <M4d3L1> xec: http://paste2.org/p/1905243
[11:42:22] <xec> M4d3L1: wheres the relevant javascript at that page?
[11:43:34] <JaMz-> someprimetime: sorry typo error, i was working on localhost... theres the updated code on the server...
[11:43:51] <JaMz-> someprimetime: when you select something on the second it populates the third
[11:44:00] <M4d3L1> xec: http://paste2.org/p/1905248
[11:44:20] <M4d3L1> I copy you the 3 part of the code.
[11:44:42] <someprimetime> JaMz-: right
[11:44:50] <someprimetime> and what is the issue now?
[11:46:29] <xec> M4d3L1: on the live site, where is GoBackToBrowse() defined?
[11:46:45] <JaMz-> someprimetime: so when you send the form... it returns whit the info...
[11:47:05] <chrisvwebdev> hi.  i have a button input with a class and an id.  there are two .click event handlers in the code, with one defining a click method for the class, while the other method handles the id click.  does jquery have an established way to fire off the class and id handlers in a certain order? will the class handler always fire first? or will the order of the code blocks that define these click methods determine which is fired first?
[11:47:07] <someprimetime> JaMz-: correct
[11:47:27] <someprimetime> oh you want the third to be populated with the selection you are currently on, right?
[11:47:29] <JaMz-> someprimetime: since the second select box is in the same page i can save the value and if it was selected it returned as selected so it regenerate the third dropdown...
[11:47:35] <M4d3L1> hum after the javascript script on the image link
[11:47:45] <johnkpaul> chrisvwebdev: your name looks familiar
[11:47:52] <someprimetime> it seems this whole page is being refreshed though… it doesn't feel like an ajax content replace in the current page
[11:47:58] <JaMz-> someprimetime: thats right!... now i want to select also the third one, ehre im on...
[11:48:04] <johnkpaul> chrisvwebdev: the handlers are fired in the same order they are added
[11:48:10] <M4d3L1> xec: near line 150
[11:48:45] <JaMz-> someprimetime: i know, thats why "when doc.ready" im trying to var id2 and send it to the ajax...
[11:48:46] <xec> what file
[11:48:56] <M4d3L1> in the html directly
[11:49:08] <chrisvwebdev> hi jkp!  thanks for the response.  yes, see, that is what i was thinking.
[11:49:14] <JaMz-> someprimetime: i have the third selection in the FORM POST as &sucursal=XXX
[11:49:28] <xec> M4d3L1 i dont see it
[11:49:42] <xec> M4d3L1: hold on
[11:49:43] <M4d3L1> you are on the compare page?
[11:49:51] <JaMz-> someprimetime: so in the ajax function i want to pass also the "+id2"
[11:50:13] <JaMz-> someprimetime: but i dont know how to embeded third choice from the FORM POST...
[11:50:17] <someprimetime> why isn't the value in the select box being generated by php? honestly you should have some kind of parameter in your url and just in your select box do <?= $_GET['third_selection']; ?>
[11:50:18] <someprimetime> or whatever
[11:50:18] <chrisvwebdev> i have inherited quite a bit of code that has click handlers in separate files.  many of them reference identical elements on the page and i'm trying to consolidate the code properly.
[11:50:27] <someprimetime> as the currently selected value
[11:50:31] <johnkpaul> chrisvwebdev: so you are the chrisv I think you are?
[11:50:58] <JaMz-> someprimetime: i can do that... but how to embed that PHP inside the javascript?
[11:51:00] <johnkpaul> chrisvwebdev: if the order actually matters, then something else hairy is going on
[11:51:22] <JaMz-> someprimetime: var id2 = <?= $_GET['third_selection']; ?>;
[11:51:22] <chrisvwebdev> jkp: not sure. where are you located?
[11:51:44] <someprimetime> JaMz-: you have to have that interpreted by the php processor
[11:51:52] <someprimetime> so you'd have to page that in your .php file
[11:51:53] <johnkpaul> NYC
[11:52:06] <someprimetime> like <script type="text/javascript">var id2 = <?= $_GET['third_selection']; ?>;</script>
[11:52:11] <someprimetime> at the top of that .php page
[11:52:11] <JaMz-> someprimetime: its already in php... so i can make that call
[11:52:17] <someprimetime> then it's now a global variable
[11:52:20] <chrisvwebdev> oh, and yes, the order does actually matter in this instance. if i change the js file order in the head section, then the code chokes with errors
[11:52:25] <xec> M4d3L1: does this demonstrate the issue? http://jsfiddle.net/LXZGn/
[11:52:40] <M4d3L1> xec: hum I fix the bug other way. direct in php :)
[11:53:31] <johnkpaul> yeah, I know that it does matter, I'm saying that that dependency is very very hairy
[11:55:29] <chrisvwebdev> jkp: no doubt.  we are setting breakpoints in firebug and going through line by line to see where the issues happen to be.
[11:55:33] <chrisvwebdev> thx for the input
[11:56:09] <xec> rewrite everything from scratch! then give up halfway
[11:57:13] <johnkpaul> you already know the selectors that are being used?
[11:57:28] <johnkpaul> if so, you can just grep through your code, no?
[11:59:51] <danzajdband> hi
[11:59:56] <danzajdband> i have a question
[12:00:08] <danzajdband> i need to clone a file input
[12:00:26] <danzajdband> and hold the selected file
[12:00:31] <danzajdband> is that possible?
[12:00:41] <danzajdband> i know that the path is read-only
[12:00:46] <danzajdband> but don't know where it is
[12:00:46] <JaMz-> someprimetime: the line doesnt work... it says when I alert: undefined...
[12:03:51] <aro> is there a way i can call a function every time the screen size changes?
[12:09:47] <Whirl3d> $('window').resize(resizeHandler);
[12:10:35] <JaMz-> someprimetime: now it works it was php error... thanks for your help!!! just change <?= to <?php.... thank you so much!
[12:27:09] <someprimetime> JaMz-: hey sorry went out to get a burrito; glad you figured it out :)
[12:31:43] <blindMoe> anyone here used $.anythingSlider() and run into a problem where it is auto sizing certain <a>'s to height and width of 100% ?
[12:32:06] <lhunath> how would I start a fadeIn(2000) on any element that gets the class .active?
[12:32:33] <blindMoe> .addClass('active').fadeIn(2000);  ?
[12:32:46] <lhunath> read the question again
[12:32:53] <hays_> How would I find all elements with :hover defined?
[12:33:05] <hays_> in jquery
[12:33:09] <blindMoe> lhunath: read the question fine the first time.. just making sure you know that it is a possibility
[12:34:06] <brianlov_> lhunath: Use CSS, transition: opacity 2s;
[12:34:11] <lhunath> well, I want any element that appears in the DOM with a .active or gains an active class to be subject to fadeIn()
[12:34:14] <chovy> how do i grab an element and move it somewhere else in the dom?
[12:34:22] <lhunath> hmm.
[12:34:24] <chovy> is this good enough?
[12:34:34] <chovy> $("#foo").append($("#bar"));
[12:34:52] <chovy> where bar gets appended to foo and removed from whereever it was before.
[12:35:46] <lhunath> I csn't use live() or so to that effect?
[12:36:23] <hays_> How would I find all elements with :hover defined, in Jquery?
[12:36:29] <chovy> lhunath: you want to fade in something with class of .active?
[12:36:34] <brianlov_> lhunath: No, you can only attach to user-initiated events. Something getting a class would never be the result of a user initiated event.
[12:36:45] <chovy> $("div").addClass('.active').fadeIn();
[12:37:01] <brianlov_> chovy: The problem is that he's not adding the class manually.
[12:37:09] <brianlov_> chovy: The class is being added and he wants to react to that event.
[12:37:13] <chovy> oh
[12:37:18] <lhunath> yeah
[12:37:18] <chovy> onchangeclass
[12:37:20] <chovy> heh
[12:37:38] <chovy> and you have no way of knowing when the class gets added?
[12:38:05] <airtonix> is there a bot here i can privatemessage to get function/method/object documentation ?
[12:38:06] <lhunath> well; I'd use the class getting added as the indicator
[12:38:06] <chovy> short of polling it, i'm not sure.
[12:38:19] <hays__> sorry if I am repeating, i am not sure if my message is getting through...
[12:38:34] <hays__> Does anyone know how to find all elements with a :hover defined in CSS?
[12:38:36] <airtonix> hays__: you must have some people on ignore then
[12:38:55] <hays__> airtonix: no, its this dumb webchat I am forced to used
[12:38:58] <hays__> (at work)
[12:39:14] <airtonix> hays__: you only have port 80 outgoing?
[12:39:23] <hays__> behind a proxy
[12:39:37] <chovy> hays__: can you give your el a class?
[12:39:40] <lhunath> vpn++
[12:40:00] <hays__> chovy: that is why I am trying to find it actually
[12:40:28] <hays__> chovy: it turns out that IE8 is really slow about processing :hover s so I am trying to find all of them and convert them to something javascript that is faster.
[12:40:48] <hays__> that way I can write css like I want to and just apply a JS fix.
[12:52:04] <WebDragon> I am unable to reset my password at jsfiddle -- I enter my email, it claims to have sent the response, but nothing ever shows up in gmail (neither the spam bin nor the inbox)
[12:52:28] <WebDragon> would anyone from jsfiddle be reachable here on freenode, does anyone know?
[13:03:54] <microhxo> Guys, i keep getting this error: $dialog.dialog is not a function  and i have jquery and jquery ui added.
[13:03:56] <microhxo> why???
[13:04:43] <arieldavidzajdba> show your code
[13:04:52] <WebDragon> check your server logs, to make sure that it's not failing to load any files due to permissions problems that would cause the script to fail (simple check, take 2 secs)
[13:04:58] <microhxo> http://paste2.org/p/1905336
[13:05:06] <microhxo> yea they are all loading
[13:05:15] <WebDragon> then make sure $dialog is actually a jquery object
[13:05:43] <microhxo> im pretty sure it is, i got it from a tutorial on jquery.
[13:05:48] <microhxo> dialog has been around forever?
[13:05:55] <WebDragon> $dialog not .dialog()
[13:06:39] <WebDragon> $somevariable is not necessarily actually a jquery object. might just be a variable
[13:06:50] <WebDragon> use the debugger and set a breakpoint so you can inspect
[13:08:02] <WebDragon> microhxo: http://fixingthesejquery.com/ <-- awesomeness
[13:08:35] <dunkel2> hello
[13:08:50] <hays__> how do I in jquery make a link active?  possible?
[13:09:09] <dunkel2> o.o
[13:09:09] <elyphas> I have this code:http://pastebin.com/jECMkEHc, I want in my event click,  get the text of the cell where I do the click, How can I do this?
[13:09:17] <microhxo> WebDragon
[13:09:26] <microhxo> the debugger is how i know the error im getting
[13:09:33] <microhxo> it says $dialog is not a function
[13:09:53] <dunkel2> elyphas: html()
[13:10:00] <dunkel2> maybe
[13:10:29] <dunkel2> if you just have text and no tags inside the cell
[13:10:32] <elyphas> but, How I get the active cell?, to do this?
[13:10:57] <dunkel2> if you clicked the cell and there is anevent listener on cthe cell you can use $(this)
[13:11:05] <dunkel2> $(this).html();
[13:11:05] <elyphas> dubellz: ok
[13:11:09] <elyphas> thanks
[13:11:25] <dunkel2> np
[13:11:53] <WebDragon> microhxo: so set a breakpoint on that line
[13:11:56] <elyphas> dubellz: It works, jeje
[13:11:59] <WebDragon> microhxo: then run the pag
[13:12:11] <WebDragon> microhxo: then inspect $dialog variable to see whether it's a jquery object or just a plain variable
[13:12:16] <dunkel2> elyphas: you talking to me?
[13:12:18] <dunkel2> xD
[13:12:29] <WebDragon> microhxo: then you know why it's not a function or .. you discover somthing else wrong
[13:12:32] <elyphas> dubellz: yes, again thanks, jeje
[13:12:46] <dunkel2> ok, because i see you say the name of a different person
[13:12:47] <elyphas> dunkel2: , jeje sorry
[13:12:55] <dunkel2> hahah  no problem
[13:14:23] <hays__> Is there a way with javascript/jquery to make a link :active ?
[13:15:43] <GoSox> if i'm binding a click handler to a class, how can i reference which actual item was clicked?
[13:18:58] <microhxo> WebDragon: I have no idea why its not a function
[13:19:04] <microhxo> i have the js files imported
[13:19:07] <microhxo> they exist
[13:19:10] <microhxo> idk wtf is going on
[13:19:30] <thang> validate them?
[13:21:18] <microhxo> what do you mean
[13:21:25] <microhxo> i am using the direct URL from jquery
[13:21:32] <microhxo> other jquery works fine
[13:21:37] <microhxo> just not $dialog
[13:22:05] <WebDragon> set breakpoint. inspect variable. determine whether object or not. has this been accomplished
[13:23:17] <mod> hi all
[13:23:38] <mod> i'd appreciate it if someone could tell me what I'm doing wrong here: http://pastebin.com/ARg6AWqR
[13:23:47] <microhxo> Followed this tutorial: http://ajaxonomy.com/2011/ajax/jquery-dialog-box-tutorial  and it errors on $('#dialog').dialog({ is not a function
[13:23:49] <microhxo> so idk wtf
[13:23:56] <microhxo> I download his source as .html
[13:23:58] <microhxo> and it runs fine
[13:24:02] <mod> what I'm trying to do is enforce .extendedStay to only validate if .weekenedStay is also checked
[13:24:07] <microhxo> i am using this in a mvc3 razor webapp
[13:25:02] <mod> microhxo, what's the left curly for?
[13:28:07] <microhxo> its apart of more of the function
[13:28:44] <mod> hmm looks fishy to me
[13:32:59] <dunkel2> GoSox: $(this)
[13:33:40] <GoSox> oh yes sorry already figured it out thanks
[13:34:15] <Phoenixz> I did a $().get(url, function(){}).error(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown){alert(errorThrown);}); There is an error, but the alert shows nothing.. What am I doing wrongt?
[13:35:41] <Phoenixz> I want to know what the error is so that I can fix it (obviously) but if the errorThrown is not showing anything, I cant do much
[13:37:43] <dabear_> ?jquery.ajax @ Phoenixz
[13:37:44] <bot-t> Phoenixz, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:37:53] <dabear_> not $().ajax
[13:38:05] <john-dev> in your case, not $().get
[13:39:10] <elyphas> I have this code: http://pastebin.com/XdGPNsik, but when run the .ajax, it tells me, KeyError: "No key 'clave': Not a form request" this is from my python code, any idea?
[13:39:23] <Phoenixz> Already there, already checked.. It says how to handle the errors, with .error(), which I do, but the errorThrown is empty..
[13:42:26] <chrisvwebdev> has anyone tried the "menu" widget for jquery ui 1.9?  i know it's still in development, but it's a very good widget.
[13:42:35] <LightScry> Can I ask a jQuery Mobile question here?  #jquerymobile is inactive.
[13:43:20] <silur> LightScry, you may intercept 'submit' event and from it do ajax call to external link
[13:43:30] <GoSox> i'm trying to do a simple 'load data into a div when you click', and it's working, but there is no animation. the data just pops in there instantly, rather than sliding in
[13:43:30] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/b4cmVfKs
[13:44:05] <chovy> GoSox: $("#city_col").hide().html($result);
[13:44:06] <denom> is it possible to send a json body in a GET request?
[13:44:19] <chovy> denom: i think you have to do post for that.
[13:44:38] <LightScry> silur: I don't want to do an ajax call.  I want to force a full reload as if the form submission was non-ajax.  I want to bypass the jQuery transition.  rel="external" accomplishes this with <a> tags, but I don't know what works with submit elements of forms.
[13:44:48] <denom> I dont really understand why that is, but I'll accept that..
[13:45:10] <denom> seems like GET with a json body should be fine :/
[13:45:37] <silur> LightScry, just set action= to external URL then
[13:45:40] <ajpiano> LightScry: there's a config option you can use in jquery mobile to make it not use ajaxy forms
[13:45:52] <GoSox> chovy: doesn't seem to help
[13:46:12] <Phoenixz> Again.. I did a $().get(url, function(){}).error(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown){alert(errorThrown);}); There is an error, but the alert shows nothing.. What am I doing wrong? jqXHR.responseText is empty too, I have not a single error indication, yet .error() is called. What am I doing wrong here?
[13:46:38] <ajpiano> LightScry: $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false;
[13:46:40] <LightScry> GoSox: I'm using "ajaxFormsEnabled : false" inside the "$.extend(  $.mobile , { " but that doesn't do it.
[13:47:05] <LightScry> is my current way of doing it deprecate ajpiano?
[13:47:24] <LightScry> ajpiano: Should I use your way instead?
[13:47:24] <ajpiano> yeah, i believe it has been superseded
[13:47:31] <LightScry> ajpiano: K, thanks.
[13:49:04] <GoSox> chovy: for some reason, when I hide city_col, it never becomes visible again. slideDown doesn't DO anything
[13:50:32] <chovy> GoSox: is slideDown still supported?
[13:50:44] <GoSox> i thought it was the standard thign
[13:50:53] <chovy> GoSox: maybe you need to hide the $results html
[13:51:06] <GoSox> i just took out the slideDown and the hide and the page works perfectly, but with no animation
[13:51:11] <chovy> GoSox: $("#city_col").html( $($result).hide() );
[13:52:01] <GoSox> chovy: i tried hiding city_col via my stylessheet. loading data into it with .html, and then revealing it with a callback slideDown
[13:52:10] <GoSox> that should be working no problem
[13:52:17] <GoSox> i would shink
[13:52:19] <GoSox> think
[13:52:42] <chovy> GoSox: http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[13:52:59] <chovy> GoSox: can you setup a jsfiddle?
[13:53:09] <diverdude> Can you recommend a good jquery lib for reading cookies?
[13:53:35] <GoSox> chovy: i need to step away for 20 minutes, i'll try to recreate this when I get back...
[13:53:46] <chovy> :wqa
[13:54:25] <srj55> having some trouble with a selector.  I want to select an element with name X that doesn't have class Y:   $('[name=X]').not('.Y').removeAttr("disabled");     what am i doing wrong?
[13:58:33] <NoiseEee> srj55: $('[name="X"]')
[13:58:57] <NoiseEee> also fwiw you might as well restrict it to inputs.
[13:59:12] <chovy> srj55: .attr("disabled", false);
[13:59:23] <NoiseEee> that too
[14:03:58] <Funksmaname> hey there - recently my computer has started acting odd - all jquery transitions are fading to/from a black  box - winXP FF 10... the transitions look fine on my iPad - any ideas?
[14:10:35] <mdpatrick> I'm trying to setup some code for a click event on elements that won't appear in the dom until after click event code is established???
[14:10:40] <mdpatrick> Anyone know how to do this?
[14:11:02] <sphinxxx> mdpatrick: .on
[14:11:06] <sphinxxx> if you're using query 1.7
[14:11:09] <sphinxxx> or .live if earlier
[14:11:20] <NoiseEee> mdpatrick: google "event delegation with jquery"
[14:11:41] <NoiseEee> but don't use delegate(), use what sphinxxx said
[14:12:51] <dunkel2> do you guys use sublimetext2?
[14:13:19] <mdpatrick> ok guys thank you :)
[14:13:24] <coldhead> some people do, dunkel2
[14:13:59] <byebyebyezzz> Can some1 tell me how to remove css element display: block? I dont want to change it to display: none. I want to remove it.
[14:13:59] <dunkel2> do you know how to avoid the word wrap when entering the distraction free mode?
[14:15:07] <mdpatrick> NoiseEee, sphinx: Is there any downside to just using $.live for… everything?
[14:15:36] <mdpatrick> (i.e. never use $('my selector').click() ever again)
[14:15:54] <NoiseEee> mdpatrick: you should be using .on() from here on out if you have the jquery version
[14:16:22] <NoiseEee> mdpatrick: as far as event delegation goes, its always a wise choice for DOMs that get updated on the fly / a bunch of similar elements that call a particular function
[14:16:42] <mdpatrick> oops I meant .on sorry
[14:16:57] <dunkel2> i have never use click anymore mdpatrick
[14:17:00] <dunkel2> just on
[14:19:36] <mdpatrick> dunkel2: Sweet that helps thanks :)
[14:19:58] <dunkel2> *you
[14:20:01] <dunkel2> np
[14:20:20] <dunkel2> sorry for my bad grammar xD
[14:21:20] <dunkel2> yeah, on() is the method to go for event on this version of jquery yesterday i upgrade a project removing all the .click() on it and now it looks a lot easier to mantain
[14:21:57] <GoSox> chovy: still around?
[14:24:50] <chovy> GoSox: yes
[14:25:30] <chovy> Can someone tell me how this code works: $("div#foo").on('submit', 'form.bar', fn);
[14:25:49] <chovy> it does work when I submit the form, but I don't understand how it gets attached to the div.
[14:26:31] <NoiseEee> chovy: its saying to observe the submit event of the form with class 'bar' thats in the div with the id 'foo'
[14:27:10] <Funksmaname> any idea why my FF is buggering up the jquery rendering? a fade event always starts or ends in a flash of black box... :S
[14:27:20] <chovy> NoiseEee: yeah, but my understanding was the event gets attached to the div and checks e.target for the form.bar
[14:27:34] <chovy> how does a submit event on a form bubble up to a div?
[14:27:58] <NoiseEee> almost all events bubble.
[14:28:16] <snover> not that one, not in all browsers
[14:28:18] <chovy> a submit bubbles up?
[14:28:32] <ajpiano> jquery artificially bubbles the submit event
[14:28:41] <chovy> a click i can  understand, you can click on anything. but a submit?
[14:28:49] <chovy> oh
[14:29:04] <ajpiano> submit change focus blur do not bubble by default, jquery fakes it
[14:29:10] <ajpiano> load doesn't bubble and jquery doesn't do anything about it
[14:32:39] <ngharo> The spec says KeyboardEvent attributes are read only but maybe someone knows of a hack to send a keypress?
[14:33:59] <GoSox> chovy: sorry i just can't get anything at all to happen in jfiddle
[14:34:11] <GoSox> theres so much server side stuff on these pages anyway, it's a pain in the ass
[14:34:22] <ngharo> implementing a virtual keyboard, which works fine for ascii but with sites like facebook being buttholes and not having submit buttons makes it impossible to comment without sending ENTER, which is impossible afaik
[14:36:17] <WebDragon> ngharo: heh yeah I've been annoyed by that too
[14:37:42] <WebDragon> also another side note, by pressing enter to get a paragraph and inadvertently submitting before having finished typing
[14:40:04] <ngharo> what is when, when focused on a FB input and calling submit() on the form doesn't work
[14:40:30] <ngharo> i accidently a word
[14:47:22] <WebDragon> lol
[14:49:33] <keirlav87> if i have a php file that returns a json object to an ajax function, how do i make that object accessible outside of the success function?
[14:50:04] <GoSox> if i'm checking to see if a tag is empty, do I just do something like $(this).html() == ""
[14:54:09] <Vainoharhainen> I want to have fadeout/fadein on a image. (hover). But i dont find any good solution just bugging
[14:56:13] <andrewjackson> Vainoharhainen: $('img').bind({'mouseover':function(){$(this).fadeIn()}, 'mouseout':function() {$(this).fadeOut();}});
[14:57:22] <andrewjackson> Vainoharhainen: 1) you're going to want to set the initial fadeOut opacity using CSS, 2) you're going to want to adjust the options for fadeIn/fadeOut
[14:57:56] <GoSox> So, if I reveal an ID with show(), it works fine. But if I try to reveal an ID with slideDown(), nothing happens, no console errors and the ID remains invisible
[14:57:58] <Vainoharhainen> whats the name of that page there i can past css/html/js ?
[14:58:07] <Vainoharhainen> so can i give a better example of what im doing
[14:58:09] <GoSox> WTF ok now it's working
[14:58:15] <GoSox> maybe this was just a safari bug
[14:58:35] <andrewjackson> jsbin.com or jsfiddle.com
[14:59:37] <Vainoharhainen> Ty.
[14:59:56] <rgr> keirlav87: you learn javascript - you assign it to a var ..
[15:01:57] <zatan_> hi is anyone of you have tried to use fancybox ?
[15:05:15] <Vainoharhainen> andrewjackson: here is a better example. http://jsfiddle.net/mJAbv/1/ what im doing
[15:06:01] <keirlav87> yes but how do i make that var accessible from outside the success function?
[15:06:53] <Vainoharhainen> andrewjackson: i want to add fadein/fadeout when the images switch.
[15:07:27] <andrewjackson> Vainoharhainen: okay one moment
[15:08:05] <Vainoharhainen> andrewjackson: thanks i have struggle with hover+fadein/fadeout many times but its tricky :P
[15:08:11] <Vainoharhainen> bugs..
[15:10:10] <DerekPioneer> what's the best way to pull out the value of width and height in a url like this: http://s7w2p1.scene7.com/is/image/pioneercolor/ugc/4281943.tif?hei=100:width=300:height=450
[15:10:19] <DerekPioneer> width: , height:
[15:10:23] <DerekPioneer> sorry didn't mean to link the whole url
[15:10:44] <nFFF> Is it an external url?
[15:10:56] <nFFF> you can get it quite easy with PHP
[15:11:06] <nFFF> but itd have to be on your server
[15:11:13] <DerekPioneer> yeah i could use php
[15:11:13] <GoSox> is there something you have to do to bind to clicks, besides .click() , when you are binding to things that don't exist on the initial page load?
[15:11:20] <Vainoharhainen> DerekPioneer: you want to parse the url?
[15:11:35] <Vainoharhainen> the gets width and height?
[15:11:42] <DerekPioneer> i just want to pull the values of :width=300 and :height=450
[15:11:47] <DerekPioneer> i want to pull 300, 450 form that
[15:11:56] <Compeeler> combobox is selct and textbox is textarea and button is input, what is regular text supposed to be
[15:12:16] <mdpatrick> How do I create a query that only selects entities with a property that has more than X objects in it?
[15:12:55] <andrewjackson> arrgh can't work with these jsfiddle/jsbin sites
[15:12:56] <DerekPioneer> i could actually change the colons in that to &s
[15:13:03] <andrewjackson> gotta make a file and test it on my own server
[15:13:07] <DerekPioneer> if there's some javascript functions that parse urls
[15:13:30] <nFFF> GoSox, on()
[15:13:59] <Vainoharhainen> andrewjackson: i appreciate your help, have sit many hours on damn animations + hover .. :P
[15:14:08] <andrewjackson> np
[15:15:33] <GoSox> nFFF: .live() was the one I was  thinking of
[15:15:51] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live()
[15:15:52] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[15:16:07] <GoSox> it is
[15:16:08] <Eviltwin> Use .on in 1.7+ or .delegate pre 1.7 instead
[15:16:53] <nFFF> Use on
[15:16:55] <GoSox> jesus, they might want to make the ".live() method is deprecated" a little more…. BOLD
[15:17:21] <nFFF> $('.class').on('click','.futureclass' function(){});
[15:17:34] <nFFF> .futureclass has to be descendant of .class
[15:17:59] <nFFF> and a ',' inbetween the 2nd and 3rd argumetn , i missed it :P
[15:18:31] <nFFF> ?on(event, selector, data, handler)
[15:18:32] <bot-t> nFFF, .live() - Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:18:59] <nFFF> bastard bot :D
[15:19:22] <nFFF> ?on("click",'.class',function(){});
[15:19:23] <bot-t> nFFF, .click() - Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[15:20:31] <chovy> GoSox: it's not deprecated, but probably will be soon.
[15:20:42] <chovy> better to use .on()
[15:23:43] <Compeeler> born to be a winner
[15:23:47] <Compeeler> born to be the very best
[15:24:13] <blindMoe> listening to a self help audio book?
[15:24:42] <Compeeler> pokemon theme song
[15:24:56] <blindMoe> aww
[15:25:09] <Compeeler> its great
[15:25:28] <GoSox> So it's pretty cool having content that can load dynamically into a web page, without needing to reload the page
[15:25:40] <GoSox> but are there any tricks to getting google to index this content?
[15:31:45] <GoSox> i hate it when you're pulling your hair out for an hour, until you finally find a little missing "#"
[15:32:47] <eddiemonge> GoSox: the loading dynamically should enhance a page. you should have non-js fallbacks
[15:33:02] <eddiemonge> unless you dont care about that sort of thing. some people dont
[15:33:29] <GoSox> yeah i'm not going to essentially make two web pages. the new html5/jquery site is replacing the old boring static site
[15:35:15] <eddiemonge> i didnt say make two pages. i said enhance your page with the dynamic loading content
[15:35:37] <eddiemonge> is your site for a corporation or anyone that, if sued, could afford the lawsuit?
[15:35:41] <someprimetime> what eddiemonge is saying is.. you make a plugin for ajax tabs? add in hrefs and make them go to an actual page
[15:35:47] <someprimetime> instead of just loading the specific content
[15:35:51] <keirlav87> anyone familiar with the datatables plugin?
[15:36:09] <someprimetime> that way google won't index whatever specific content you're loading which it has done a bunch of some old sites of mine
[15:36:11] <andrewjackson> Vainoharhainen: can't get jQuery('#slider .slides .tabactive') to return anything =S
[15:36:24] <andrewjackson> seems like a big fat bug in jQuery
[15:36:49] <andrewjackson> I think that's the source of your problems though, the selectors are working right, or I'm not working right not sure lol
[15:36:52] <andrewjackson> I'll keep trying
[15:37:57] <eddiemonge> andrewjackson: ?
[15:38:27] <andrewjackson> eddiemonge: helping Vainoharhainen with something
[15:39:32] <eddiemonge> got that. was wondering the what
[15:39:33] <GoSox> i can't seem to get my .on("click") handlers to work for items that get inserted into the page dynamically (via the previous .on("click") that does work)
[15:40:18] <eddiemonge> GoSox: you need to use the delegate part of see ? on
[15:40:18] <bot-t> GoSox, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:40:45] <andrewjackson> http://jsfiddle.net/Kg9Q2/ wtf???
[15:41:10] <andrewjackson> console.log(jQuery('#slider .slides .tabactive')) returns p[
[15:41:11] <andrewjackson> []
[15:41:51] <andrewjackson> and tabactive is properly being set for the class
[15:42:28] <Vainoharhainen> andrewjackson: wierd
[15:42:41] <Vainoharhainen> yeh tabactive is there hmm
[15:43:16] <andrewjackson> it seems proper
[15:43:26] <andrewjackson> there must be some ascii problem
[15:43:44] <andrewjackson> meaning, gonna have to rewrite everything =/
[15:44:16] <Vainoharhainen> i will test
[15:44:19] <Vainoharhainen> on my orginal code
[15:44:20] <Vainoharhainen> localy
[15:44:48] <Vainoharhainen> wtf!
[15:45:01] <Vainoharhainen> if you set
[15:45:02] <Vainoharhainen> .tabactive
[15:45:05] <Vainoharhainen> you get result
[15:45:15] <GoSox> oh
[15:45:15] <GoSox> my
[15:45:16] <GoSox> god
[15:45:16] <GoSox> no
[15:45:17] <GoSox> way
[15:45:42] <GoSox> eddiemonge: that's what i'm doing but something still isn't jiving
[15:45:55] <eddiemonge> Vainoharhainen: you dont have .slides.  there is .slide or #slides
[15:46:56] <Vainoharhainen> andrewjackson-^
[15:47:17] <Vainoharhainen> eddiemonge: :)
[15:48:33] <andrewjackson> eddiemonge: I just realised that -_- lol
[15:48:44] <andrewjackson> I actually switched over to say so lol
[15:50:59] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/VM6LNKz1
[15:51:10] <GoSox> clicks in #state_col are working, but clicks in $city_col are not :(

[15:52:04] <ajpiano> ffuu
[15:52:30] <ajpiano> jaequery: what isn't working
[15:52:50] <jaequery> bah nvm, it was stupid bug on my end :|
[15:52:54] <jaequery> thx anyway
[15:52:58] <keirlav87> please can anyone point me to a resource I can read that will explain how to allow me to use a variable outside of a function
[15:53:11] <GoSox> search javascript variable scope
[15:53:13] <nFFF> keirlav87, declare it outside the funcgion?
[15:53:28] <GoSox> function is italian for function :D
[15:53:42] <GoSox> CRAP i meant to say it's italian for "fucking function"
[15:53:56] <GoSox> i just screwed up a hilarious joke
[15:54:00] <nFFF> ?jsfiddle @ GoSox
[15:54:00] <bot-t> GoSox, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[15:54:16] <jaequery> although i dont understand why the on() isn't smart enough to just let me do $('#invoice_container .trig_email_client').on('click', function(){ .....
[15:54:29] <ajpiano> because you are mising the point
[15:54:46] <andrewjackson> Vainoharhainen: http://jsbin.com/oyoyed/edit#html
[15:54:54] <andrewjackson> is that what you were expecting?
[15:55:04] <ajpiano> event delegation works by selecting something that *is* there, and then letting things inside of it 'delegate' dealing with that event until it bubbles to the container
[15:55:14] <andrewjackson> just click on render for a preview
[15:55:27] <jaequery> i mean, can't it automatically just grab the parent element and then delegate off of that by default?
[15:55:27] <Phoenixz> Can I attache a .ready() event on an <img> tag that would give me a ready event once the image has been fully loaded?
[15:56:02] <jaequery> hm i think i see the point now
[15:56:03] <ajpiano> jaequery: that would be an insane thing to put into an API
[15:56:13] <ajpiano> "read my mind"
[15:56:34] <GoSox> nFFF: can jsfiddle load external web pages?
[15:56:51] <keirlav87> i still get "an empty string" even though my function should be assigning a value into the variable when i log the var outside of the function
[15:57:02] <nFFF> GoSox no
[15:57:10] <nFFF> or maybe
[15:57:13] <nFFF> but i dont know how :>
[15:57:14] <jaequery> and live() was essentially the on('click', 'body'  .... ?
[15:58:01] <ajpiano> yes, $("selector").live("click", fn) was just $(document).on("click", "selector", fn),
[15:58:01] <GoSox> well i can't create a jsfiddle test case because all of my content is loaded from external pages, which in turn get it from my database. and my problem is with that data that is getting inserted. but i can just link you to the web page if you want to look at it
[15:58:11] <eddiemonge> keirlav87: paste the code you are using as there are various things you could be describing
[15:58:25] <eddiemonge> GoSox: yes, depending on what you mean by load
[15:58:41] <GoSox> i mean $.get()
[16:00:05] <keirlav87> can really post the whole thing as php is involved but here -> http://jsfiddle.net/v9JQz/
[16:00:12] <keirlav87> the first console.log contains the json object
[16:00:16] <keirlav87> the second is an empty string
[16:00:59] <eddiemonge> the second is empty because ajax has populated it yet
[16:01:16] <eddiemonge> the second actually executes before the first
[16:02:26] <devOlsen> has anyone ever ran into an IE issue where jquery (that lives in side of an iframe and is of same domain) wont submit when I try to submit the form via .submit(); Keeps telling me Access Denied.
[16:02:35] <devOlsen> seems to be only IE7 and 8
[16:02:48] <eddiemonge> GoSox: are the city_col ones loaded in from the state? your delegation is wrong
[16:03:00] <GoSox> eddiemonge: http://new.menulizard.com/by-city/
[16:03:14] <GoSox> wrong how?
[16:03:38] <patric100e99> Hey, I am using 1.7.1 and I was previously able to do $.fn["appear"] and $.fn["hide"] to call those effect methods...  Now that no longer works, does anyone know a way around this?
[16:03:43] <GoSox> clicking an item i #state_col loads the content into #city_col, which in turns loads #rest_col
[16:04:00] <eddiemonge> i effin hate pastebin. whats the point of the textarea below the code????
[16:04:17] <eddiemonge> GoSox: 	$("#city_col").on("click","ul li a",function()
[16:04:20] <patric100e99> exit
[16:04:27] <GoSox> oh
[16:04:28] <patrick99e99> Hey, I am using 1.7.1 and I was previously able to do  $.fn["appear"] and $.fn["hide"] to call those effect  methods...  Now that no longer works, does anyone know a  way around this?
[16:04:36] <GoSox> eddiemonge: but then how come the #state_col is working?
[16:05:36] <GoSox> yay your way IS working thought!
[16:06:51] <eddiemonge> GoSox: because the state stuff exists
[16:07:15] <eddiemonge> when you click state, you are replacing everything in city_col this the binding on city_col ul li is getting erased
[16:07:45] <eddiemonge> patrick99e99: what is that supposed to do? whats wrong with .show() and .hide() ?
[16:08:26] <eddiemonge> forgot the "supposed to do part". didnt look close enough
[16:12:43] <mrassi> is this the right way or should I chain or any other methods? $('li[class="passed"],li[class="failed"]')
[16:12:54] <chovy> is https://github.com/ down?
[16:13:40] <mrassi> chovy: it is for me 'maintenance'
[16:13:41] <ajpiano> mrassi: $("li").filter(".passed, .failed") is how i'd handle that
[16:14:04] <mrassi> ajpiano: great thanks I was expecting something cleaner
[16:15:06] <mrassi> ajpiano: there's no need to define for which attribute?
[16:15:18] <ajpiano> mrassi: .foo is a class selector...
[16:15:19] <mrassi> oh .
[16:15:21] <mrassi> ok
[16:15:46] <ajpiano> same as css....
[16:15:58] <ajpiano> for other attributes, yes, use the brackets
[16:15:59] <ajpiano> but not clases
[16:16:02] <mrassi> ok
[16:17:09] <chovy> mrassi: $(".passed, .failed");
[16:17:23] <cbart> i'm trying to make a simple picture carousel in jquery and the jquery UI hide function that allows hiding left or right.
[16:17:31] <nFFF> whats the fastest, .filter or $('li .passed, li .failed)
[16:17:54] <chovy> filter probably is too iterations.
[16:17:57] <chovy> two*
[16:17:58] <cbart> but when i loop through, the UI functions keep looping but it has no concern about the order of operations in the carousel loop
[16:18:17] <ajpiano> nFFF: do a jsperf and find out
[16:18:57] <nFFF> do you already know the answer?
[16:19:12] <nFFF> becuase its late :\
[16:19:46] <ajpiano> i am pretty sure what i wrote is faster but it really depends on the borwser and i genuinely stopped caring about that stuff so long ago
[16:20:58] <nFFF> :>
[16:24:25] <patrick99e99> is $('#foo').appear() part of core or is it a ui thing?
[16:26:53] <ajpiano> neither.
[16:27:00] <ajpiano> don't know where you got it from but it ain't a thing
[16:27:48] <eddiemonge> patrick99e99: like i said earlier, its .show()
[16:29:03] <eddiemonge> or maybe you were using a plugin like http://code.google.com/p/jquery-appear/
[16:31:33] <dogmatic69> hi all,
[16:32:15] <dogmatic69> I am having a problem including this JS on my site http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1520943753 I get errors like "Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function" but on different files
[16:32:58] <eddiemonge> dogmatic69: did you include jquery before that?
[16:33:18] <dogmatic69> ye, jquery is at the top of the includes
[16:33:26] <dogmatic69> that one is down the bottom
[16:33:32] <eddiemonge> link to that page?
[16:34:21] <dogmatic69> its local :/
[16:34:53] <eddiemonge> are there more than one jquery's on that page?
[16:36:00] <eddiemonge> ugh github being down sucks
[16:36:03] <dogmatic69> no just the one. I just noticed the errors are in files after the one I pasted
[16:36:28] <dogmatic69> is it possible its something to do with the noConflict
[16:36:59] <eddiemonge> dogmatic69: you are using noConflict in that script so you need to use the noconflict part
[16:37:10] <dogmatic69> ?
[16:37:16] <dogmatic69> DEBUGKIT.$ = jQuery.noConflict(true);
[16:37:43] <dogmatic69> could that cause issues with the rest of my js? I only use jQuery so never bothered with the noConflict
[16:37:57] * muzone is now playing: Muzone - Warm Pad (http://home.no/reddvinylene/warm_pad_after_rv.mp3)
[16:38:00] <muzone> shit is all off sync but if i put in some more work
[16:38:39] <eddiemonge> dogmatic69: it could be
[16:40:34] <eddiemonge> so any reference to $ after that wont work
[16:41:33] <dogmatic69> it was that. I removed the $ = DEBUGKIT.$ stuff
[16:41:34] <eddiemonge> to get around that, your code should be wriiten like  (function($){  })(jQuery);
[16:45:38] <someish> how does one go about using multiple forms in a single view, wherein each form saves to a separate associated model? i can get one form to save, but not two.
[16:48:37] <eddiemonge> someish: thats pretty vague. see ? demo
[16:48:38] <bot-t> someish, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[17:07:49] <SinnerNyx> eddiemonge: ^^
[17:08:05] <eddiemonge> SinnerNyx: thats not a jquery issue. thats not even really an issue

[17:09:17] <ajpiano> i *think* it works on 1.7.x, but test
[17:10:38] <SinnerNyx> eddiemonge: never said it was any kind of issue. i want to know if the scroll event you posed as an alternative to the mouse wheel event.
[17:10:46] <SinnerNyx> ajpiano: that seems to be the ticket. thanks :)
[17:19:56] <rmancy> Does anyone know if there is a way of destroying all dialog instances without actually have the reference to the instances ?
[17:20:26] <rmancy> this is in regards to jquery-ui
[17:26:41] <syborg> rmancy: Maybe something like $('.ui-dialog-content').dialog('close') ?
[17:35:50] <rmancy> syborg, no don't think that will do the trick. I think I need a different approach
[17:37:12] <someprimetime> so twitter is obviously using localstorage to go back and maintain the state when loading new tweets (with their endless scroll) but how are they not refreshing the entire page? it seems it's not even making a web server request in that it just uses whatever is in the cache
[17:37:46] <coldhead> it is a twisted string
[17:38:44] <someprimetime> huh?

[18:20:14] <prometh> hey,  honest critique
[18:20:31] <empireoflight> if it worked it would be beautiful in my eyes
[18:20:41] <chee> prometh: I don't think you know what critique means
[18:20:49] <prometh> yes i do
[18:20:51] <prometh> it looks cheap
[18:21:03] <prometh> i can go into detail, but then it'd start getting rude
[18:21:17] <chee> if you went into detail, then it would be a critique
[18:21:22] <chee> as it stands it's just an insult
[18:21:27] <empireoflight> haha touché
[18:21:35] <chee> and that's pretty rude already
[18:21:42] <prometh> drop shadow on the left looks fake and just "let's put some effects"

[18:25:36] <empireoflight> prometh how does the nab not look like a nav?
[18:25:43] <empireoflight> *nav
[18:25:57] <prometh> it's pushed over to the right above the banner.. looks like it's just tabs for the banner
[18:26:01] <jedimind> because its a nb.

[18:26:04] <jedimind> fail.

[18:27:03] <jedimind> holy shit you're stil alive prometh
[18:27:17] <prometh> :) yep

[18:28:04] <prometh> it's still great for games... but now no more awesome animated apps for the web

[18:29:38] <Shai-Tan> I have some jquery-ui tabs. in one of the subtabs, I have some links, I wish to load the link content into the current subtab. How do I do this?
[18:30:25] <ndss56> hi guys, i have a dropdown box, which i want to add an option "Enter your own text". Is this something that is done in javascript or can be done simply in HTML?
[18:32:01] <ndss56> im guessing the <option> would be somehow changed into an <input>
[18:35:06] <eddiemonge> prometh: there are lots of games being made for the web not in flash
[18:35:15] <eddiemonge> like angry birds, field runners etc
[18:36:03] <eddiemonge> ndss56: look at see ? autocomplete
[18:36:04] <bot-t> ndss56, jQuery UI - Autocomplete Demos & Documentation - The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. Here the suggestions are tags for programming languages, give "ja" (for Java or JavaScript) a try. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[18:37:02] <ndss56> eddiemonge: autocomplete?
[18:38:50] <craea> http://codepad.org/5hlhxc0R <- can i apply it for <table>??
[18:40:14] <chee> there's really nothing on derbauer.de that couldn't be done with html5 and related technology
[18:40:45] <coldhead> craea: if you replace 'ul' with 'table' and 'li' with 'tr' maybe!
[18:40:46] <Guddu> Dear all...I have a form and i want only files of certain types be allowed to be uploaded from this form. What is the best way to go about this?
[18:43:19] <eddiemonge> Guddu: check the files in the backend
[18:47:06] <ndss56> eddiemonge: i'm planning to have a drop down box with an option "Enter your own text" among predefined options
[18:47:20] <craea> coldhead: i've tried but doesn't work -> http://codepad.org/R3CBVk7I :(
[18:48:03] <ndss56> eddiemonge: when a user selects "enter your own text", i use jquery to replace drop down box with an input.
[18:48:26] <joey___> noob jquery question :  how do I insert into this field instead of append?   var ul = $("#mainDiv").empty().append("<form action='#'></form>").append("<ul style='list-style-type:none'></ul>");  I want the list inside the form
[18:48:44] <ndss56> eddiemonge: is this how you would do it?
[18:49:27] <ndss56> coldhead?
[18:50:13] <chee> coldhead?
[18:50:28] <ndss56> lol
[18:50:43] <chee> it's a good question
[18:51:23] <coldhead> i have no idea what i'm even doing in this channel
[18:51:42] <coldhead> i've a query for you: what the hell is jQuery?
[18:52:06] <ndss56> coldhead: any ideas about my drop down box?
[18:52:21] <ndss56> coldhead: is that how you would do it?
[18:52:52] <coldhead> i would probably try to find a plugin to do it for me
[18:53:05] <coldhead> and make sure i had a really great sandwich for lunch that day
[18:53:11] <coldhead> but yeah, that's what i'd try
[18:53:36] <ndss56> coldhead: a plugin? but what i am suggesting is really simple.
[18:53:55] <chee> ndss56: so is coldhead
[18:54:25] <coldhead> the nice things about plugins is you get to blame someone else
[18:54:30] <coldhead> even if they're really simple
[18:54:35] <joey___> noob jquery question answer $("#mainDiv").empty().after("<form action='#'></form>") returns the div NOT the newly created form.  is there a better way to approach this?
[18:54:37] <coldhead> but whatever floats your pontoons
[18:55:00] <ndss56> coldhead: i don't think there is a plugin for what i am suggesting.
[18:56:09] <ndss56> coldhead: i just want to have an option that the user can enter themselves.
[18:58:20] <coldhead> sounds good ndss56
[18:58:32] <coldhead> use a + sign in the menu
[18:58:35] <coldhead> so people will understand
[18:58:40] <coldhead> like chrome
[18:58:42] <coldhead> + Add New
[18:59:19] <ndss56> coldhead: right. and when user clicks + add new i want them to enter the text
[18:59:56] <ndss56> coldhead: now does whole drop down menu gets replace with an input or you show an input underneath the drop down box?
[19:00:40] <coldhead> if the menu is actually a <select> you will have to do it someplace else
[19:00:43] <coldhead> i think
[19:01:25] <ndss56> coldhead: yes menu is a <select>
[19:01:58] <coldhead> you can't have an <input> in a <select>
[19:02:00] <coldhead> i just tried it
[19:02:09] <ndss56> coldhead: would delete <select> and replace with <input> or add <input> after </select>?
[19:02:10] <coldhead> so you'll have to show the input someplace else
[19:02:20] <coldhead> i would hide the select
[19:02:25] <coldhead> and show an input in its place
[19:02:37] <coldhead> then show the select again with the input appended
[19:04:03] <ndss56> coldhead: the menu is something like select your favourite fruit
[19:04:13] <coldhead> i understand
[19:04:21] <ndss56> coldhead: but there is an option "Enter your own favourite fruit".
[19:05:42] <ndss56> coldhead: i thought you would just let the entered text as it and just expect user to hit submit button.
[19:09:01] <prometh> if I have a <p> with a bunch of <a>'s in it and I click one of them, how can I find out its index among <a>'s ONLY?
[19:10:00] <ndss56> prometh: number the <a>'s
[19:10:02] <prometh> $(this).index() is among other element types
[19:10:08] <prometh> number them?
[19:10:23] <ndss56> yes
[19:10:36] <prometh> with data(), huh?
[19:10:49] <ndss56> <a class="numberOne"...>
[19:10:58] <coldhead> ndss56: i would do something like this as quickly as possible and get on with my life http://jsfiddle.net/5zwg2/
[19:11:00] <prometh> i'd rahter not do it manually... i'll try data()
[19:11:00] <prometh> thank you
[19:12:01] <coldhead> i have to go get a boil lanced, good luck ndss56
[19:12:13] <ndss56> coldhead: cheers mate

[19:36:19] <Whirl3d> boy can I clear a channel or what?
[19:57:34] <djcercone> can someone explain 'bind' versus 'trigger'?
[19:57:58] <djcercone> are 'bind' and 'trigger' similar to getting notifications?
[19:58:18] <coldhead> bind is where you say if X happens, do Y
[19:58:26] <coldhead> trigger is where you say MAKE X HAPPEN
[19:58:33] <coldhead> and thus invoke Y
[19:58:46] <coldhead> probably better not to think of it in notification terms
[19:59:00] <ngharo> coldhead.trigger('sexytime')
[20:00:19] <coldhead> exactly, you've just invoked my arousal handler
[20:00:31] <ngharo> im learning
[20:01:17] <coldhead> next up, sildenafil citrate
[20:01:27] <monad> lol
[20:01:50] <djcercone> so if I have something like bind('fetch', params), I'm saying if a fetch happens do whatever func is declared in params
[20:02:24] <djcercone> if I say trigger('fetch', params), make fetch happen with given params?
[20:04:59] <ngharo> the docs have some good examples, see ?trigger
[20:05:00] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[20:05:22] <ngharo> look at -> Example: To pass arbitrary data to an event
[20:06:49] <djcercone> thanks, I'll give it a look.  Somewhere along the lines though, whether bind or trigger, the first parameter defines a declared function somwhere?
[20:06:58] <djcercone> somewhere*
[20:07:14] <felixqc> how can i find the position of an element in chrome?
[20:07:34] <ngharo> ?position @ felixqc
[20:07:35] <bot-t> felixqc, .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[20:07:42] <ngharo> srsly
[20:10:23] <djcercone> ngharo: was that srsly meant for my comment?
[20:11:12] <coldhead> of course not, djcercone
[20:11:12] <ngharo> djcercone: no
[20:11:18] <coldhead> #jQuery isn't that kind of place
[20:11:19] <coldhead> carry on
[20:11:45] <coldhead> open the blast shields of your heart
[20:11:48] <djcercone> sorry, just checking
[20:12:38] <ngharo> djcercone: on() is prefered vs bind() if you're using jquery 1.7+
[20:12:44] <ngharo> fyi
[20:13:28] <djcercone> ngharo: thanks, I'm trying to use the Spine JS framework, so I'll have to look what version of jQuery is being used

[20:22:09] <DreamStiffler> Hey guys
[20:22:16] <wookiehangover> heyyy
[20:22:37] <coldhead> guyyys
[20:22:47] <ngharo> :-*
[20:22:56] <DreamStiffler> im wondering what is the best way to post multiple values in a sinle checkbox...is that possible?
[20:23:36] <DreamStiffler> and girls
[20:24:33] <mrassi> PHP: Predominantly Hazardous Programming
[20:25:36] <coldhead> DreamStiffler: <input type="checkbox" name="tings" value="aids,lol,777,spiderbait" />
[20:25:42] <coldhead> and let the server pick them apart
[20:28:59] <DreamStiffler> meaning add the function to split the value then?
[20:30:06] <DreamStiffler> but what if i already have things like value="Batman,Superman,Plasticman,Ironman..." and i want to add age like 34,12,34,56,78,... ?
[20:30:27] <DreamStiffler> btw im planning to apply this to a hidden input (is this a good idea?)
[20:30:44] <DreamStiffler> should i have 2 different hidden inputs then?
[20:31:15] <coldhead> var val = $('#thing').val(); $('#thing').val(val + ',' + newvals.join(','));
[20:31:33] <coldhead> i would prefer to have one input per value
[20:31:39] <coldhead> for simplicity
[20:31:59] <coldhead> if a thousand flowers bloom on the server from a single input in the client...
[20:32:04] <coldhead> that's where bugs are born
[20:32:07] <coldhead> probably
[20:32:45] <DreamStiffler> >> var val = $('#thing').val(); $('#thing').val(val + ',' + newvals.join(','));
[20:33:26] <DreamStiffler> i would prefer to have different nputs as well
[20:33:34] <DreamStiffler> just wondering if its the better approach
[20:33:40] <DreamStiffler> thank you
[20:34:01] <coldhead> whatever works for you is the best approach
[20:34:07] <coldhead> simplicity is good <3

[20:49:53] <research4oscar> Is there a way load a page with all input items within a div disabled.
[20:50:18] <research4oscar> I would need to enable the items before form submission.
[20:51:01] <coldhead> $('.some_div').find(':input').attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[20:51:07] <coldhead> or disabled="disabled" in the html

[20:55:37] <Whirl3d> is scrollTop an attribute or property?

[20:56:01] <Whirl3d> Cork, thanks.
[20:56:04] <Cork> np
[20:56:26] <research4oscar> coldhead: The page would have to load with the items disabled if one of the questions was asked on a previous page.
[20:56:41] <research4oscar> so perhaps on ready or something?
[20:56:57] <Cork> Whirl3d: if it was an attrubute it would be something statical
[20:57:26] <Cork> Whirl3d: as attributes is set on the dom element/html tab
[20:57:28] <Cork> *tag
[20:58:03] <Whirl3d> thanks. I am slowly getting the hang of differentiating between properties and attributes. Not sure why I have a problem with it...
[20:58:05] <coldhead> research4oscar: if they're different pages you can use cookies to preserve the state and test that before disabling
[20:58:40] <coldhead> OR if it's ajaxy you can use ajax() or load() or something and retrieve the html, modifiy the disabled attribute as required and then inject it into your page
[20:58:43] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[20:58:44] <research4oscar> yeah, one of the questions is asked on a previous page.
[20:58:53] <coldhead> cookies then :(
[20:59:00] <research4oscar> lol!
[20:59:06] <research4oscar> okay. thanks.
[21:00:35] <coldhead> even molluscs have weddins'
[21:11:44] <coldhead> sooo, everybody's good?
[21:11:53] <coldhead> case closed?
[21:11:55] <coldhead> take five?
[21:12:17] <research4oscar> coldhead: here is my php condition: if ($row['id_lead_source']==55
[21:12:40] <research4oscar> then disable the items between <div1>
[21:13:10] <research4oscar> your were saying I could store the database result in a cookie?
[21:13:16] <coldhead> no
[21:13:31] <coldhead> you can save the state of the input that crates that database result in a cookie
[21:14:07] <research4oscar> the input would be a drop down list.
[21:14:12] <research4oscar> in this case.
[21:14:13] <coldhead> right
[21:14:17] <research4oscar> correct?
[21:14:25] <coldhead> so then i'd do a change handler for that drop down
[21:14:36] <coldhead> or you could test for the particular value when the form is submitted
[21:14:40] <coldhead> but in either case
[21:15:07] <coldhead> if ($('#some_thing').val() === 'Some particular value') $.cookie('disablethosethings', true);
[21:15:28] <coldhead> and then later if ($.cookie('disablethosethings')) {...}
[21:15:39] <coldhead> assuming you are using the jQuery cookie plugin
[21:15:44] <coldhead> which is a no brainer, really
[21:15:55] <coldhead> even i use that and it's my first day using jQuery
[21:16:29] <research4oscar> :)
[21:16:35] <research4oscar> sure it is.
[21:16:52] <research4oscar> i'll give it a shot. thanks for clarifying.
[21:17:08] <optraz> $("#id").click(function(){ <== i have a function where when user click the input button, the label text for that button is change, however, i noticed that, it also added extra style (style="position: absolute; top: 803.067px; left: 466.75px; opacity: 0.7; display: none;">) to the label , this make the label jump like monkey in the web form. how do i tell jquery not to add extra style?
[21:18:41] <coldhead> optraz: just changing the text won't add that stuff
[21:18:53] <coldhead> you must be using animate() or fadeIn() or fadeTo()
[21:18:56] <coldhead> or similar
[21:19:01] <coldhead> or something else is doing that
[21:21:09] <Whirl3d> how does one determine the native focus style for each browser?

[21:31:55] <Shai-Tan> hmm, 1.7.1 has errors that break ie8
[21:33:59] <coldhead> Shai-Tan: it really shouldn't, the devs run a massive test suite in all major browsers before release
[21:34:03] <coldhead> do you have a test case?
[21:34:25] <coldhead> Whirl3d: there is an html attribute and a JS property, i believe

[21:43:00] <whomp> when a user clicks on a box, i want a rectangle with rounded corners to appear over a portion of the site. how can i do this?
[21:43:19] <coldhead> ?modal
[21:43:20] <bot-t> There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
[21:43:41] <civilordergone> thanks coldhead!
[21:44:09] <whomp> thx
[21:44:42] <coldhead> my pleasure civilordergone
[21:45:12] <palanivel> hi hi
[21:45:40] <palanivel> any1 help me ....... how to display list of data dynamically
[21:46:36] <palanivel> using jquery
[21:47:41] <coldhead> ?g jquery tablesorter @ palanivel
[21:47:43] <bot-t> palanivel, jQuery plugin: Tablesorter 2.0 - http://tablesorter.com/
[21:47:50] <coldhead> use something like that and good luck
[21:50:45] <Whirl3d> jesus christ the jsfiddle plugin for chrome sux
[21:50:56] <coldhead> you can hardly blame jesus for that
[21:51:01] <coldhead> poor guy has been through enough
[21:51:10] <Whirl3d> I was asking for his help in smiting the author, thank you
[21:52:10] <coldhead> i think the crucifixion may have damaged his punching hand
[21:52:48] <Whirl3d> I'm sorry, did you say cruci-fiction?
[21:53:50] <coldhead> people generally doubt the resurrection more than the crucifixion but whatever floats your boats
[21:53:57] <coldhead> the important thing is the POWERFUL SYMBOLISM
[21:55:02] <snover> I doubt that you know anything about this coldhead
[21:55:24] * coldhead is shamed
[21:58:19] <optraz> $("#foo :input").tooltip({ <== this find all inputs within the id foo, how do i add a criteria only find input of type text?
[21:59:27] <coldhead> $('#foo input[type="text"]')
[21:59:42] <coldhead> ooh
[21:59:44] <coldhead> ?:text
[21:59:44] <bot-t> :text: Selects all elements of type text. http://api.jquery.com/text-selector/
[21:59:54] <coldhead> use :text instead of :input
[22:01:08] <optraz> $('#foo input[type="text"]') <== can i chain it by adding dropdown select?
[22:01:31] <palanivel> hi hi
[22:01:37] <palanivel> any1 help me...........
[22:02:07] <palanivel> how to display list of data in html page and dynamic too
[22:02:52] <coldhead> ?add @ optraz
[22:02:52] <bot-t> optraz, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[22:03:14] <coldhead> palanivel, you desperate mouthbreather, i linked you to a plugin that will suit your needs
[22:03:19] <coldhead> pay more attention
[22:05:23] <optraz> coldhead: no, not .add
[22:05:40] <optraz> i want something like $('#foo input[type="text|select"]')
[22:06:39] <DreamStiffler> lets say i have 5 checkboxes. but on submit id only want the value of the last checkboxes be sent. how do i unable the other four from being posted?
[22:06:43] <DreamStiffler> is it even possible?
[22:09:33] <optraz> anyone?
[22:09:33] <DreamStiffler> the thing is the fifth checkbox gets its value from the other four checkboxes
[22:09:39] <optraz> i want input type text and select only
[22:09:41] <DreamStiffler> but only the fifth needs to be posted
[22:12:33] <civilordergone> hey coldhead: here's that logic implemented :) http://paintacquaint.com/
[22:12:36] <civilordergone> when you hover images
[22:12:56] <civilordergone> i gotta add like a background to some of them
[22:13:58] <ndss56> var $input = $('<input>').blur(function() {
[22:13:58] <ndss56> }); <-- does the blur handler get fired here or do i have to do $select.after($input);
[22:13:59] <Whirl3d> optraz $("select, :text")
[22:15:45] <optraz> thanks, Whirl3d works superb
[22:16:24] <optraz> Whirl3d: i have something like $("#foo select,:text").click()
[22:16:47] <Whirl3d> DreamStiffler, perhaps you should handle a custom submit function that removes all of thefields you don't want before serializing output.
[22:16:54] <Whirl3d> optraz, that's a good case for using .on
[22:17:39] <Whirl3d> $("#foo").on("click", function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); if (targ.is("select, :text")) { do something}});
[22:17:43] <optraz> mmm.. new to jquery, yes. on() looks good too but i stick with mine now
[22:17:44] <optraz> :)
[22:17:47] <optraz> thank you anwayy..
[22:18:57] <Whirl3d> optraz, keep in mind your selector ("#foo select, :text") will select ALL input:text fields and only those "select" elements inside #foo
[22:19:15] <Whirl3d> you probably want $("#foo select, #foo input:text");
[22:19:21] <optraz> yes, exactly what i want , Whirl3d
[22:20:31] <coldhead> thanks Whirl3d
[22:21:16] <Whirl3d> ?
[22:23:16] <Whirl3d> I just came across my first plugin...how funny. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/YFHxu/18/
[22:23:53] <coldhead> Whirl3d: i was just reading the backlog and all ready to tell him to use , and you beat me to it <3
[22:24:04] <DreamStiffler> yes i know it needs to be customed
[22:24:06] <coldhead> so thanks for that
[22:24:12] <DreamStiffler> but any guidance what to be used?
[22:24:57] <Whirl3d> coldhead, I thought you were getting that boil lanced, so I stepped in. Normally, you know, I would always defer to you.
[22:27:19] <Whirl3d> $("form").on("submit",function (e) {var checkBoxes=$(this).find(":checkbox"); checkBoxes.each(function () {if ($(this).index()<3) $(this).remove();}); $.ajaxForm("somephp.php", $(this)) .....or something like that.
[22:27:38] <ndss56> coldhead: can i comment on your code?
[22:27:42] <Whirl3d> not a great solution, but it might work.
[22:27:54] <coldhead> go nuts, ndss56
[22:28:10] <ndss56> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/qQGUA/1/ <-- see comments inside
[22:29:00] <DreamStiffler> thats a long oen to understand but thanks
[22:29:25] <coldhead> ndss56: http://jsfiddle.net/qQGUA/2/
[22:31:33] <ndss56> coldhead: what does it return in that situation?
[22:31:52] <coldhead> the right thing
[22:32:02] <coldhead> oh the return bit?
[22:32:04] <Shai-Tan> uncaught exception: [Exception... "Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIDOMViewCSS.getComputedStyle]" nsresult: "0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS)" location: "JS frame :: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js :: anonymous :: line 22" data: no]
[22:32:06] <coldhead> who cares
[22:32:07] <coldhead> undefined
[22:32:09] <Shai-Tan> Is this a good error?
[22:32:11] <ndss56> coldhead: yes the return it
[22:32:11] <coldhead> no one is looking
[22:32:37] * coldhead applauds Shai-Tan's error
[22:32:38] <ndss56> coldhead: cleaner code to do the indent :D
[22:33:08] <Shai-Tan> thank you, thank you very murch </elvis>
[22:33:15] <coldhead> ndss56: that's what we in the legal business call "a matter for yourself"
[22:33:32] <ndss56> coldhead: it took me a while to figure what your code was doing :S
[22:34:03] <coldhead> i wrote it as quickly as possible to give you something to look at
[22:34:16] <coldhead> it would obviously be better if i was getting paid
[22:34:21] <coldhead> through the magic of capitalism
[22:34:22] <Shai-Tan> coldhead: that is what is breaking in IE8
[22:34:49] <coldhead> Shai-Tan: can you do a jsfiddle up as simply as possible to trigger that error?
[22:34:57] <coldhead> then someone can fix it
[22:35:05] <coldhead> and your name will go down in history
[22:35:35] <ndss56> coldhead: the only grip is that the input in only added as an option when the input loses focus. might be better if it also includes when the user hits the enter key
[22:35:44] <Shai-Tan> sure, soon as I find a work around, I need this stuff done by 4:00pm, its now 5:35pm
[22:37:23] <coldhead> ndss56: total matter for yourself
[22:37:33] <coldhead> i just did a demo of how it could work!
[22:37:38] <Shai-Tan> and why is it looking for http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js ??
[22:37:39] <coldhead> you get to debug and make it great
[22:37:57] <coldhead> Shai-Tan: THAT is a matter for yourself
[22:39:38] <ndss56> coldhead: any ideas how i bind an enter key event to input function?
[22:41:03] <coldhead> ?keypress
[22:41:04] <bot-t> .keypress(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keypress" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[22:41:16] <coldhead> and test e.keyCode (i think) for 13 (i think)
[22:41:42] <coldhead> ndss56: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/302122/jquery-event-keypress-which-key-was-pressed
[22:41:42] <ndss56> coldhead: thanks my man
[22:42:21] <coldhead> e.which is apparently preferred
[22:46:31] <ndss56> coldhead: right. i found out that you do have to do If( ===) or it will not allow you to add option after you already added one.
[22:46:58] <mehrdad> how can i tell if a js file is written using jquery?
[22:47:18] <coldhead> mehrdad: if it uses the jQuery variable or $() a lot
[22:47:22] <coldhead> then it's probably jQuery
[22:47:44] <coldhead> if the code is wrapped in $(document).ready(function () {..})
[22:47:49] <coldhead> that's very jQuery
[22:48:25] <tw2113> check if the website includes the jquery library
[22:48:54] <tw2113> if it is, subsequent script blocks may be jquery
[22:48:56] <coldhead> tw2113++
[22:49:22] <Whirl3d> can you select on option element like $("option[value='test'],option[text='test']")?
[22:49:27] <ndss56> what does ++ mean or + mean above?
[22:49:27] <tw2113> if you see "mootools"....1. the code may be mootools based 2. run
[22:49:47] <tw2113> coldhead was just incrementing my awesomeness by 1
[22:50:08] <mehrdad> well openlayers isn't written using jquery, right?
[22:50:16] <mehrdad> i dont see any jquery var
[22:50:29] <tw2113> what is openlayers?
[22:50:53] <mehrdad> let me check their site, www.openlayers.org
[22:50:56] <coldhead> Whirl3d: yes but consider :contains()
[22:51:21] <tw2113> ooh, open street maps
[22:51:22] <astropirate> mehh.. i dont' like openlayers
[22:51:43] <mehrdad> it is most certainly not jquery, or there would not be a mapquery plugin right
[22:52:14] <astropirate> looked through their code.. its a mericle hat thing runs at all :p
[22:53:03] <mehrdad> now, there's another file extending the openlayers and i need to make sure it is jquery
[22:53:12] <mehrdad> it has this line in it  this.$element.hide();
[22:53:17] <mehrdad> so it is def jquery?
[22:53:42] <Cork> can be, doens't have to be
[22:54:10] <Cork> mehrdad: that could be prototype too
[22:54:19] <mehrdad> Cork, all that attempts u saw turned out to be wasted effort
[22:54:20] <Cork> and prob extjs
[22:54:33] <mehrdad> mapquery that i was using doesnt support the functionality that i need
[22:54:40] <mehrdad> checked their channel
[22:54:45] <mehrdad> sigh
[22:55:13] <Cork> mehrdad: best say to see if a file is jquery is by looking at its selectors
[22:55:22] <Cork> or if its wrapped in a scope with jQuery
[22:55:36] <Cork> good practis jquery plugins always has that scope
[22:55:39] <ndss56> coldhead: would it be technically more correct to put a <label> for the <input>?
[22:56:38] <mehrdad> no it is not, and that has me thinking it is not jquery, 90% sure
[22:56:45] <mehrdad> it has this syntax tho  _.each(bg_layers, function (l) {
[22:56:50] <mehrdad> is it specific to jq?
[22:57:00] <tw2113> Cork are you pretty good with your plugin-fu?
[22:57:14] <Cork> mehrdad: not specific, but it can be
[22:57:31] <Cork> tw2113: i've written about 15 plugins for a site i have
[22:57:36] <coldhead> ndss56: probably
[22:57:40] <coldhead> i never use labels
[22:57:40] <mehrdad> what other lib has that syntax?
[22:57:42] <Cork> so i've fiddeled with plugins and extending them and so on
[22:58:09] <Cork> mehrdad: its just variables, so it could be for any framework that has .each
[22:58:20] <Cork> so still extjs or prototype
[22:58:50] <coldhead> or zepto!
[22:59:24] <tw2113> Cork would you be willing to look at a plugin i'm working on? just for initial best practice checks?
[22:59:47] <Cork> if its not too big sure; i'm at work so i can't stray off too much
[22:59:51] <ndss56> coldhead: it probably doesn't need it as the previous + Add New tells the story, but from what i read each control element should have a label
[22:59:57] <tw2113> it's really short and early still
[23:00:17] <tw2113> https://github.com/tw2113/tweetQuery/blob/master/tweetquery-000001.js
[23:00:21] <tw2113> 50 lines
[23:00:25] <ndss56> lol
[23:00:27] * Cork is just busting his head trying to implement websocket
[23:00:31] * Cork hates google T_T
[23:00:36] <mehrdad> well i think i better settle that it is not jquery, no jquery var no $ sign at start start and end, no wrapping
[23:02:00] <mehrdad> this could shed some light: the file uses this line many times = CLASS_NAME: "OpenLayers.Control.ToolPanel"
[23:02:03] <Cork> tw2113: those tweets concatinations, is leaky in older ie browser; not sure if you care, but anyway
[23:02:14] <mehrdad> class_name is a keyword i guess
[23:02:24] <tw2113> Ie7 and down?
[23:02:48] <tw2113> if it's bad in IE8 too, i'll take a note, otherwise, 7 and down can piss off
[23:03:05] <Cork> tw2113: i know its bad in ie6, not sure when it was fixed
[23:03:13] <Cork> (if its fixed)
[23:03:27] <tw2113> meh :D
[23:03:32] <tw2113> nothing else stands out?
[23:03:39] <Cork> tw2113: whats the success function meant to do?
[23:03:40] <coldhead> ndss56: it "should" but then your site "should" work for blind people who have javascript disabled
[23:03:50] <Cork> its declares a function nothing more
[23:03:55] <mehrdad> or some rule for a lib
[23:03:56] <mehrdad> tw2113, i would say do away with ie8 as well
[23:04:13] <Cork> mehrdad: a developer can't really do that
[23:04:21] <Cork> mehrdad: that would mean kill off winxp
[23:04:29] <Cork> and thats the major os
[23:04:32] <tw2113> it's not functional yet, but will retrieve tweets once I'm further along
[23:04:38] <ndss56> coldhead: OK i understand now. Blind people are not important. Cheers.
[23:05:14] <Cork> tw2113: how do you plan to add them back on the page?
[23:05:30] <Cork> through this.each(... this.append?
[23:05:41] <Cork> sorry $(this).append
[23:06:02] <tw2113> it'll likely be a concat'd variable appended to a container that will be specified when the plugin is used
[23:06:20] * Cork nods
[23:06:38] <Cork> don't really see anything wrong with it no
[23:06:47] <tw2113> trying to keep performance in mind from the getgo
[23:07:04] <Cork> hmm
[23:07:07] <tw2113> cool. It's my first jquery plugin attempt
[23:07:11] <Cork> wait a min
[23:07:17] <Cork> your using json cross domain
[23:07:23] <Cork> that won't work
[23:07:34] <tw2113> i need my dataType to be jsonp don't i
[23:07:39] <Cork> ya
[23:07:50] <tw2113> good catch
[23:07:50] <Cork> and thats a quit big security problem
[23:07:55] <ndss56> coldhead: I could do <label for="something"></label><input />... <--empty label :D
[23:08:04] <Cork> but hey, if your ok with it
[23:08:33] <coldhead> works for me, ndss56
[23:09:02] <ndss56> coldhead: thats what i want to hear.
[23:09:12] <Cork> tw2113: and to explain "quite big secirity problem" jsonp is a haven for xss
[23:09:16] <tw2113> we'll see further down the line when i get it more complete and ready
[23:09:28] <Cork> tw2113: as you can easily execute any js on your site
[23:09:41] <Cork> as long as you can intersept the jsonp call
[23:09:44] <tw2113> is getJSON a better option?
[23:09:48] <Cork> no
[23:09:54] <Cork> its still forced to use jsonp
[23:09:58] <tw2113> k
[23:10:06] <Cork> from a client side, cross browser jsonp is the only option
[23:10:21] <Cork> i my self would prob do a server side proxy instead though
[23:10:40] <Cork> that way you don't have to access arbitary executable code
[23:10:53] <tw2113> noted down in comments :D
[23:10:58] <tw2113> thanks again
[23:11:28] <Cork> jsonp is basically a js file with a function heres_your_json() { /* i run what i like here*/ ; return json };
[23:12:04] <tw2113> good question here...is it best to avoid a blank callback?
[23:12:16] <Cork> doesn't matter
[23:12:16] <tw2113> give the callback name a unique identifier?
[23:12:19] <tw2113> dart
[23:12:33] <tw2113> drat
[23:12:35] <Cork> if you set it to ? it just means jquery sets the name it self
[23:13:23] <Cork> the only farly safe option is csp
[23:13:35] <Cork> those many browsers doesn't support it yet
[23:13:41] <Cork> *though
[23:15:27] <tw2113> got it
[23:17:29] <Whirl3d> can someone explain why this only works for the first custom value...(it's based on colhead's earlier fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/qQGUA/22/)
[23:18:59] <Cork> only the first?
[23:19:02] <Cork> what do you mean?
[23:19:30] <Whirl3d> If you select "custom" and enter "test" for example, then re-selefct "custom" and enter test2, it will show "pear"
[23:19:40] <Whirl3d> even though the console logs "test2"
[23:19:45] <Cork> ah
[23:19:53] <ndss56> does .length work on strings?
[23:19:54] <whomp> why isnt anything popping up when a user clicks on this button?
[23:19:54] <whomp> http://thesparkcollective.com/members/misc.html
[23:20:05] <Cork> Whirl3d: cause you don't update the opts list
[23:20:42] <Cork> when a new option is added the opts need to be renewed else you won't have the new value in it
[23:20:47] <Whirl3d> I'm using $("option")...that should update it..rather than the cached opts
[23:21:28] <Whirl3d> or rather $sel.find("option")...
[23:21:42] <Whirl3d> rather than the cached opts...I found that a little while back.
[23:22:39] <Whirl3d> It sets the change handler at the beginning of the script (which only needs opts defined to look for .customOption) then the change handler doesn't use opts any more.
[23:25:37] <Whirl3d> And if you select a value that has already been defined, it logs the option with the value you entered, so I know it's there. But it still selects the first option.
[23:26:19] <whomp> do i have to import all the files like jquery.ui.selectable, jquery.ui.progressbar.js, etc. or is there a single .js file that encapsulates them all?
[23:26:52] <tw2113> it'd be easy to put them together into 1
[23:27:15] <whomp> it sounds tedious
[23:27:21] <whomp> so i was just wondering
[23:27:24] <tw2113> copy/paste ?
[23:27:31] <Cork> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/qQGUA/24/
[23:27:47] <whomp> yeah...
[23:27:49] <Cork> Whirl3d: you get a race condition cause the element isn't registered in the select box yet
[23:27:57] <whomp> i was wondering if there is a file which already has them
[23:28:36] <whomp> like, is jquery-ui-1.8.17.custom.js an encapsulation of them all, or is that something else?
[23:29:29] <Whirl3d> a "race condition"...wow. I would have never in a million years figured that out. Thanks a lot Cork!
[23:29:50] <Cork> np
[23:30:02] <Cork> Whirl3d: debugger; often helps there
[23:30:15] <Cork> if you halt the code and it "works"
[23:30:29] <Cork> its usually cause something else gets the time to do its job
[23:30:53] <tw2113> i need to learn how to use the debugger tools better
[23:31:05] <Whirl3d> Which debugger do you use?
[23:31:12] <ndss56> is there a way to print js code in this example, alert($(this)); //i get {object]
[23:31:18] <Cork> i meant add "debugger;" in the code
[23:31:31] <Cork> Whirl3d: that will trigger the tracer in firebug and chrome
[23:31:39] <Cork> not too sure about the others never use them much
[23:31:57] <whomp> how can i get this button to properly pop up a new dialog?
[23:31:58] <whomp> http://thesparkcollective.com/members/misc.html
[23:33:55] <Cork> ndss56: alert($(this).toSource())
[23:36:04] <Whirl3d> whomp, that looks like something you need to take up with the BigFrame plugin folks, I would guess.
[23:36:35] <Whirl3d> whomp, I like your mission statement. Very nice
[23:37:07] <ndss56> Cork: no such thing as toSource()
[23:37:34] <ndss56> Cork: your killing me dude :S
[23:39:21] <Cork> bah, so its gecko only
[23:39:29] <Cork> didn't know that (rarly usesit though)
[23:42:52] <Cork> ndss56: well my best sugestion is use console.log instead :)
[23:46:39] <pif> hi, how do I download jq's dev version (1.9?) ?
[23:48:09] <Cork> pif: http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Build_From_Git
[23:48:18] <pif> thanks
[23:48:38] <pif> has anyone tried the tooltips in that version? is it usable?
[23:49:31] <tw2113> it seems you can download the dev version straight from the frontpage
[23:49:44] <ndss56> Cork: i use IE
[23:49:46] <Cork> no thats just uncompressed 1.7.1
[23:49:51] <tw2113> ah
[23:50:00] <ndss56> Cork: not sure IE has console.log
[23:50:10] <ndss56> Cork: IE8
[23:50:12] <Cork> its accessable here though http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js
[23:50:43] <pif> ah, I'm confusing with jq-ui's dev version
[23:50:44] <Cork> ndss56: wouldn't use that as my development browser... >_<
[23:51:11] <ndss56> Cork: what do u use?
[23:51:13] <tw2113> i wouldn't use that as my browser period
[23:51:25] <Cork> ndss56: chrome, firefox and opera
[23:51:35] <Cork> ndss56: all of them have decent development enviroment
[23:51:38] <Cork> ie sucks
[23:51:47] <ndss56> Cork: even ie9?
[23:51:59] <Cork> yes
[23:52:03] <Cork> it sucks less, but ya it sucks
[23:52:12] <ndss56> ie10 beta?
[23:52:24] <Cork> i don't run win8 so haven't tested
[23:52:25] <pif> you'd have to run windows, which sucks
[23:52:36] <pif> so any ie sucks
[23:52:41] <ndss56> lol
[23:52:58] <Cork> i run old is in win2k8r2 enviroment (vm)
[23:53:05] <Cork> and ie10 doesn't install there
[23:53:09] <Cork> it demands win8
[23:53:25] <tw2113> it won't be supported in vista at all
[23:53:32] <ndss56> Cork: upgrade to windows 7
[23:53:41] <tw2113> upgrade to a real OS
[23:53:44] <pif> I have win7 kvm's with ie8 and ie9 for testing
[23:53:52] <Cork> uh... win2k8 r2 is the server equiv of win7
[23:54:07] * tw2113 linux snob
[23:54:11] <Cork> server os emulates much better then desktop versions so i don't run those
[23:54:17] <Cork> same here
[23:54:31] <Cork> well winxp emulites fine
[23:54:44] <ndss56> i goto run. bye all.
[23:54:49] <Cork> but vista and 7 breaks to a halt
[23:56:06] <Cork> pif: http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js
[23:56:12] <pif> cool
[23:56:12] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css
[23:56:34] <pif> Cork: have you tried it?
[23:56:35] <tw2113> oh git
[23:56:41] <Cork> no
[23:57:42] <mehrdad> he only had to press f12 to get a full dev env on ie
[23:57:52] <mehrdad> i really despise all the hate against windows
[23:58:06] <mehrdad> and yes , i suck at js
[23:58:11] <Cork> mehrdad: ya, but that env sucks
[23:58:14] <pif> mehrdad: it is well deserved

[23:59:12] <mehrdad> moe broken that linux?
[23:59:22] <mehrdad> the fucking os cant stil get the windows focus right ffs
[23:59:26] <pif> linux is what you make it
[23:59:38] <prometh> is there a multiple-element version of hasClass()? Like, say I wanted to do:  $("ul > li").hasClass("something").length
[23:59:43] <mehrdad> fuck it, i want to use it, not tamper with it
[23:59:46] <Cork> uh.. its not actually linux that has the problem
[23:59:48] <Cork> its xserver
