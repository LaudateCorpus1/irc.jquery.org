[07:13:23] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone, i have an ajax form with xhr posts, i only see my posts get triggered multiple times. Any idea where I could start debugging this?
[07:14:05] <jarr0dsz> it seems a single POST gets posted 2 times
[07:15:49] <jarr0dsz> also it seems like my javascript.js file is stackedup, so it gets loaded like 10 times. Im using a form that reloads itself to a #wrapper_form suspect this is the problem somewhere
[07:17:02] <jarr0dsz> revelant code part that loads the xhr response: https://8n1.org/14962/f1e3
[10:05:24] <jarr0dsz> good afternoon fellow rubyists.
[10:05:50] <jarr0dsz> im breaking my head on a issue with ajax post and cors. It works with no https, but with https im loosing my session variables
[10:06:27] <jarr0dsz> now there are so many online posts regarding this issue that im a bit overwhelmed i tried serveral fixes but it still fails to persist my session values upon ajax post
[10:07:52] <jarr0dsz> so what i do is post my session[] object , i can see it looses values upon post
[10:09:18] <jarr0dsz> is there someway i could fix this? it works locally just when deployed in https im loosing the values

[17:52:42] <TheWild> hello
[17:53:47] <TheWild> how does jQuery handle .data()? When setting data, do targeted element know about it (is this set on element or somewhere else)?
[17:54:01] <TheWild> I managed to get there: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data/Data.js
[17:57:20] <TheWild> never mind. I was on jQuery site to test it, but they're using older version (1.something).
[17:57:34] <TheWild> Tested on 3.4.0 and indeed, my data is in document.body.jQuery340089312993843403482
