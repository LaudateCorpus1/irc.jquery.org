[17:01:14] <lupulo> i have a problem with windows text resizer, when it has 150 %, a element in my website is moved. How to do closed to the left nav bar, i have tried with width blablabla % i cannot use zoom
[17:01:44] <robertmaxrees> great css question :)
[17:04:29] <lupulo> robertmaxrees width: auto is not :'(
[17:04:36] <robertmaxrees> i mean for the css channel.
[17:06:11] <lupulo> jquery is more powerful than css i think
[17:06:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:06:29] <robertmaxrees> your issue is due to css.
[17:06:32] <robertmaxrees> not jquery.
[17:07:15] <lupulo> but jquery could fix that at least
[17:07:21] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:07:23] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[17:07:33] <lupulo> ok thx
[17:08:29] <robertmaxrees> just out of curiosity, why not ask in #css??
[17:08:35] <robertmaxrees> there are more people in there.
[17:13:36] <lupulo> too expert for me
[17:14:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:18:54] <Waldkauz> We're even more expert here B)
[17:19:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:24:21] <lupulo> css always will be there, ok
[17:24:38] <robertmaxrees> just trying to get you help as quickly as possible :)
[17:32:23] <lupulo> mmm perhaps overflow...
[18:27:44] <lupulo> robertmaxrees i think css is more browser based, and jquery is not browser based
[18:27:56] <lupulo> it was my reason, i believe
[18:28:08] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:28:36] <robertmaxrees> they're both browser based - jquery is a DOM manipulation javascript library.  hardly useful outside of the browser.
[18:31:00] <lupulo> jquery could do a reanalisis of the situation
[18:31:15] <robertmaxrees> so can CSS.
[18:31:30] <robertmaxrees> in fact, css is a better tool for the job AND is faster at it, as well :)
[18:37:20] <lupulo> css doesn't have ajax
[18:37:41] <robertmaxrees> i mean... no?  that's a job for a different tool.
[18:37:55] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't have a way to access filesystems.
[18:38:17] <robertmaxrees> perl can't run natively in browsers.
[18:38:28] <robertmaxrees> i am, sadly, unable to make a sandwich using haskell.
[18:44:47] <lupulo> jquery could fix some errors in the web server
[18:45:04] <robertmaxrees> jquery is not intended for server-side.
[18:45:37] <robertmaxrees> in fact, 90% of what it offers has nothing to do with the server :)
[18:45:50] <lupulo> web server is the quarterback
[18:45:53] <lupulo> :)
[18:46:05] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[18:57:11] <lupulo> finally running back with bootstrap robertmaxrees :)
[18:57:36] <robertmaxrees> cool - glad you found a CSS grid system to help :)
