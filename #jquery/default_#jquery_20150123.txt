[00:54:28] <FilipNortic> can Is there any slimed down way to select a range of child element and concat their text inside?
[00:55:09] <FilipNortic> s/can//
[01:00:00] <Cork> FilipNortic: just select the elements and call .text()
[01:00:14] <funhouse> Hi guys, I have this code, but when I click submit it's still submitting, how do I prevent the form function from submitting? --> http://pastebin.com/rTdFWDk9
[01:00:52] <Cork> funhouse: and you're sure the event handler is called?
[01:00:59] <Cork> (also you don't need the return;)
[01:01:23] <AdamPDotty> and you got a form with the id form?
[01:01:41] <Cork> that's kinda implied with the first question
[01:02:18] * AdamPDotty is explicit today
[01:02:27] <FilipNortic> Cork: well it is in a function and depending on which values a search was done with it needs diffrent ranges of childs.
[01:02:38] <FilipNortic> but there are no such methods I take it
[01:03:12] <Cork> FilipNortic: didn't you just say you where explicit today? :D
[01:03:51] <Cork> funhouse: http://jsfiddle.net/ncmoeL3k/
[01:04:01] <FilipNortic> If that is a joke it over my head sry?
[01:04:28] <Cork> FilipNortic: your very vague in what you want to do
[01:04:33] <Cork> *you're
[01:12:52] <FilipNortic> Cork: $(td:nth-child(n), this).text(), but i would like to make n a range
[01:22:35] <Cork> FilipNortic: nth-child can create ranges
[01:23:06] <Cork> FilipNortic: but note nth-child is position of its parent
[01:23:24] <Cork> and if you want range in found elements you might get the wrong element with that
[01:28:27] <chargen> Hi. I'm using this line to change an img src but it doesn't have effect. $('#trophy'+trophyPosition).attr("src", "assets/trophy_"+trophyPosition+".png");
[01:28:39] <chargen> why?
[01:44:55] <Cork> chargen: are you sure the selector finds the element you want?
[01:45:12] <chargen> I have a log before and seems ok
[01:45:45] <Cork> console.log($('#trophy'+trophyPosition).length > 0)
[01:46:33] <chargen> returns false
[01:46:40] <chargen> hmm...
[01:46:41] <Cork> there you go
[01:46:46] <chargen> thanks
[01:46:46] <Cork> the selector is not matching
[01:47:45] <chargen> oh I forgot something
[01:55:06] <faraway> I currenlty write a plugin that extends the scroll event with the information how the event was tiggered:
[01:55:10] <faraway>  by user interaction (scrollbar, wheel, key, …)  or programatically (using .anmation, .scrollTop)  while this already works ok, there are still some bugs.
[01:55:20] <faraway> does anyone know a plugin that does something similar?
[01:55:40] <faraway> I already search for such a plugin, but didn’t find anything, that way i started to create an own one.
[02:06:05] <chargen> Cork: got it working now, thank you very much!
[02:23:54] <baako> hi guys how do I remove li with the id which is in the data-id stored in the array http://kopy.io/85piv
[02:25:48] <arup_r> Any body have this book - http://www.manning.com/derosa/ ?
[02:28:50] <MEGAGHZ> Hello lovely people.
[02:30:48] <Omar-> baako maybe if($.inArray(li, statuses)) { $("[data-id="+statuses+"]").remove(); }
[02:31:08] <Raydiation> hi how can i detect if an element has finished animating when using css3 animations?
[02:31:21] <Omar-> use animationEnd events
[02:31:24] <Raydiation> in jquery you could do: if !elem.is(':animated')
[02:31:34] <Omar-> !g animation end events
[02:31:35] <b-ot> Omar-: How to Capture CSS3 Animation Events in JavaScript - SitePoint → http://www.sitepoint.com/css3-animation-javascript-event-handlers/
[02:31:52] <Omar-> Raydiation ^^
[02:32:36] <Omar-> !g transition end events
[02:32:38] <b-ot> Omar-: javascript - CSS3 transition events - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2794148/css3-transition-events
[02:32:46] <Raydiation> using an event feels very weird
[02:33:15] <Raydiation> id have to attach a class on even start and remove a class on event stop just to check if it is animated
[02:33:35] <baako> Omar-: :( didnt work
[02:34:00] <Omar-> baako can create a fiddle? i'm not too familiar with $.inArray
[02:34:16] <Omar-> Raydiation then use animationend event, it's handy
[02:34:50] <Raydiation> Omar-: although its kinda easy to do with an angular directive :)
[02:35:00] <Omar-> $(document).on("animationend", ".animated", function () { $(this).removeClass("animated"); });
[02:35:01] <Raydiation> Omar-: its a bit more complicated
[02:35:51] <Omar-> Raydiation I have no idea if there's any other methods.
[02:36:00] <Omar-> there are
[02:36:18] <chargen> How can I change an img src to another with a fade effect but without white?
[02:37:18] <chargen> the new img should fade on top until it cover the old img
[02:40:15] <Cork> chargen: you can't animate between two images in the same element
[02:40:24] <Cork> you have to put two elements on top of each other
[02:40:39] <chargen> can it be done by changing the src?
[02:40:49] <Cork> no
[02:41:19] <chargen> I need to know how to put it exactly there then
[02:44:26] <Cork> chargen: simplest is to just have a span wrapping the img
[02:44:46] <chargen> I'll try it thanks
[02:45:02] <Cork> and set background-image on the span to be the current image
[02:45:08] <Cork> set the image to opacity: 0
[02:45:24] <Cork> replace the src and then animate opacity to 1
[02:45:34] <Cork> and when that's done remove the background image
[02:47:06] <chargen> I would like to put the new img on top and add opacity until 100% then remove the old one below. I already have the img in a div. Could it works as with the span right?
[02:52:38] <Cork> chargen: if you have to absolute position the img tag and position it over the old element if you want to do it that way
[02:52:56] <Cork> chargen: the reason i talked about a span is cause you don't have to do all that position juggling
[02:53:16] <chargen> ah cool, thanks
[02:53:32] <chargen> I knew you mention span for some reason
[03:01:42] <chargen> Cork: How should I add the new img to the span?
[03:02:14] <chargen> I append it but that puts it at the side of the old one
[03:02:31] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/87oqwctL/
[03:02:37] <Cork> you don't
[03:03:11] <Cork> you prob want to store the new url in another location then in the js though
[03:03:21] <Cork> but this is basically what i talked about
[03:04:17] <Cork> and a version without transparency http://jsfiddle.net/87oqwctL/1/
[03:05:10] <chargen> ok, thanks!
[03:12:21] <Erwat> var isWin = Math.random() > 0.5; <-- is this a valid way of having a 50-50 chance of winning?
[03:12:49] <Cork> depends on how precise it has to be
[03:12:57] <Erwat> or maybe it should be < 0.5?
[03:13:05] <Cork> random is psudo random so...
[03:13:45] <Erwat> it's [0, 1) so it should be [0, 0.5) and [0.5, 1)
[03:14:05] <Cork> you normally do Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)
[03:14:21] <Cork> you normally do if(Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)) {}
[03:14:38] <Erwat> what's the difference?
[03:15:04] <Erwat> isn't that just like checking if it's <0.5?
[03:15:12] <Cork> i'm not sure how much you can count on the decimal values of random
[03:15:31] <Erwat> well it'll be <0.5 or >0.5 anyway
[03:15:32] <Cork> what you typed might work
[03:15:41] <Cork> but i've never seen it used that way
[03:16:02] <Erwat> i just didn't think about whether it should be < or >
[03:16:21] <Cork> if you can count on the decimals <> doesn't matter
[03:16:32] <Erwat> what do you mean?
[03:16:52] <Erwat> Math.random returns [0, 1)
[03:17:03] <Cork> no it returns a float of decimals
[03:17:07] <Cork> not 0 or 1
[03:17:08] <Erwat> this means that Math.random() > 0.5 means that
[03:17:20] <Erwat> it is a loss on [0, 0.5] and a win on (0.5, 1)
[03:17:41] <Erwat> and [0, 0.5] "is larger" than (0.5, 1)
[03:18:03] <Erwat> i don't know what they really called it in statistics
[03:18:14] <Cork> well what you get is a value between 0 and 0.99999
[03:18:17] <Cork> you never get 1
[03:18:21] <Cork> for example
[03:18:28] <Erwat> yes that's what the [0, 1) means
[03:18:33] <Erwat> 0 is inclusive but 1 is exclusive
[03:18:43] <Erwat> so 0 to 0.5 with both inclusive has 2 more values than 0.5 to 1 exclusive
[03:18:49] <Cork> your reading straight of the documentation right now huh?
[03:18:57] <Erwat> i looked it up on mdn
[03:19:11] <Cork> anyway my comment still stands, i'm not sure how much you can count on the decimals of .random()
[03:19:30] <Erwat> well the exact values truly don't matter currently
[03:19:41] <Erwat> it's just so somebody won't later be pedantic to me about that same issue
[03:19:42] <Cork> well it does
[03:20:10] <Cork> if(Math.random() < .5) {} means you have less then 50% change
[03:20:18] <Cork> if(Math.random() > .5) {} means you have more then 50% change
[03:20:28] <Cork> as .5 isn't at the middle
[03:21:25] <Cork> floor cuts off the decimals so you know more of what you have there
[03:21:46] <Erwat> you're right about .5 not being in the middle
[03:21:53] <Erwat> or well,might be
[03:22:02] <Cork> no you know it isn't at the middle
[03:22:05] <Erwat> id on't know how float/double precision would affect this
[03:22:09] <Cork> you just don't know how far from the middle it is
[03:22:18] <Erwat> how do you know it's not in the middle?
[03:22:23] <Erwat> in math you would know that
[03:22:33] <Erwat> [0, 0.5) and [0.5, 1) would be the same size
[03:22:41] <Cork> .9 - 0.0 / 2 != .5
[03:23:08] <Erwat> i don't understand that
[03:23:12] <Cork> the problem is you don't know how many significant decimals it returns
[03:23:20] <Cork> Erwat: random never returns 1
[03:23:23] <Erwat> yes
[03:23:27] <Erwat> it doesn't
[03:23:34] <Erwat> but it does return 0
[03:23:39] <Cork> so the highest number is somewhere under 1
[03:23:45] <Erwat> yes
[03:23:51] <Erwat> but then the quesiton becomes
[03:24:02] <Cork> how far that number is under 1 is how far .5 is off from the half point
[03:24:03] <Erwat> is the float/double precision uniformly across the distribution between 0 and 1
[03:24:22] <The_Photographer> good morning
[03:24:22] <Cork> and that is why you want to use .floor
[03:24:23] <Erwat> eg is the imprecision between (0.49, 0.5) the same as it is between (0.99, 1)
[03:24:26] <Cork> cause then you don't have to care
[03:24:36] <Erwat> Cork: yeah but if it is that way
[03:24:41] <Erwat> [13:24] <Cork> how far that number is under 1 is how far .5 is off from the half point
[03:24:43] <Erwat> if this is true
[03:24:45] <Erwat> then it doesn't matter
[03:24:55] <Erwat> the problem would be if that isn't true
[03:25:00] <The_Photographer> I have a problem with mask, when the value is null, it return '01/01/1900' :S
[03:25:12] <Cork> Erwat: huh?
[03:25:12] <Erwat> [0, 0.5) contains all the numbers from 0 to 0.5 but excludes 0.5
[03:25:25] <Erwat> [0.5, 1) contains all the numbers from 0.5 to 1, but excludes 1
[03:25:41] <Cork> but that isn't what you're testing
[03:25:45] <Erwat> but i am
[03:25:51] <Erwat> if i am testing <0.5
[03:25:59] <Erwat> then it is [0, 0.5) or [0.5, 1)
[03:26:01] <Cork> [0, 0.5] [0.5x, 1]
[03:26:04] <Cork> is what your testing
[03:26:08] <Erwat> Cork: not ture though?
[03:26:15] <Erwat> Math.random() < 0.5 is [0, 0.5)
[03:26:19] <Cork> no
[03:26:21] <Erwat> yes?
[03:26:35] <Cork> it would be <= .5
[03:26:38] <Erwat> if Math.random() returns 0.5 then it is false
[03:26:48] <Erwat> <= .5 is what you stated
[03:27:13] <Erwat> [] is inclusive () is exclusive
[03:27:33] <Erwat> but you did bring up a very good point about imprecision
[03:27:35] <Cork> what ever, i don't care
[03:27:41] <Erwat> well thanks for the help though!
[03:27:50] <Cork> all i know is you don't get a 50-50 chance with the statement you wrote
[03:28:17] <paulvd> hello, if i create ul li list inside a tab, the bullets wont show? i added the css for that as well, still its not showing huh

[03:32:15] <kambridge> sigh!!
[03:32:29] <Cork> make sure you have jquery included
[03:33:08] <kambridge> oh dear... I had a syntax error
[03:33:12] <kambridge> rendering the js invalid
[03:36:05] <paulvd> what paste

[03:36:35] <chargen> 	var tspan = $('#social_frame').contents().find('#ranking_frame').contents().find('#trophyspan'+trophyPosition);
[03:36:37] <chargen> Cork: I have this two lines which are almost equal but the second doesn't get anything:
[03:37:03] <chargen> I don't know why
[03:37:57] <Cork> console.log('#trophyspan'+trophyPosition)
[03:38:03] <Cork> make sure that element actually exist
[03:39:31] <chargen> trophyPosition is the I already used it
[03:39:39] <Erwat> Cork: you're right
[03:41:40] <Erwat> in the sense that it will not yield 50% winrates
[03:41:56] <Erwat> but what you suggested seems to also yield <50% winrates
[03:42:25] <Erwat> or maybe i'm just getting unlucky over billions of rolls
[03:43:32] <Erwat> over 20 cycles of 2 billion rolls none of the cycles had a Win % of 0.5 or greater they were all 0.4999something
[03:44:22] <Cork> Erwat: that would be true if you don't round/floor the value ya
[03:44:43] <Erwat> no i copypasted what you said: if (Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)) {
[03:44:46] <Erwat> i tried this incomparison
[03:44:51] <Erwat> and it seemed to have about the same results
[03:45:07] <Cork> try with Math.round then
[03:45:50] <Erwat> >75% winrate
[03:46:14] <Cork> on how many rounds?
[03:46:15] <Erwat> anyways, it doesn't really matter, it's just interesting
[03:46:21] <Erwat> 300 million per cycle, 20 cycles
[03:52:41] <Cork> Erwat: how far off is Math.floor(Math.random() * 10.1) ?
[03:52:54] <Cork> (from a 0 to 10)
[03:53:41] <Erwat> i don't get teh question
[03:53:41] <Cork> hmm i think i see something now
[03:53:48] <Cork> ya, ignore that one
[03:53:50] <Erwat> and i'm sorry, i don't really have much time atm on it
[03:54:01] <Cork> ya, me nether
[03:54:21] <Erwat> well, thanks though! it's an interesting idea
[03:54:29] <Erwat> i think the issue might beMath.random() or the way flaots/doubles work
[03:54:36] <Cork> Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1
[03:54:52] <Cork> that should actually be correct
[03:55:03] <Cork> with a 50% chance
[03:56:23] <Cork> so (Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1) > 5
[03:56:45] <Cork> or Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) > 4 should worktoo
[03:56:48] <Cork> *work too
[03:57:03] <Erwat> all > 50% wins
[03:57:09] <Erwat> 0.5000x
[03:57:14] <Erwat> everys ingle cycle
[03:57:16] <Cork> man was too long since i fiddled with random
[03:57:19] <Erwat> but yeah, i need to stop spending time on it
[03:57:28] <Cork> and this is always the problem
[04:25:44] <mightyiam> Does anyone happen to know where the source for QUnit 2.x is?
[04:27:04] <mightyiam> I'll ask in -dev
[04:28:22] <Cork> most likely on github
[04:28:47] <Cork> yup https://github.com/jquery/qunit
[04:29:02] <Cork> mightyiam: or did you mean release?
[04:37:13] <mightyiam> Cork, I don't see a 2.x tag thre
[04:37:37] <mightyiam> This is why I can't seem to find it
[04:38:50] <Cork> hmm
[04:39:01] <mightyiam> I don't understand. This page states latest release is 1.17.1: http://qunitjs.com/
[04:39:34] <mightyiam> While also it has a link to "2.x upgrade guide" http://qunitjs.com/upgrade-guide-2.x/
[04:39:39] <Cork> ya, it is a bit confusing
[04:40:28] <mightyiam> "This guide will assist in upgrading from QUnit 1.x to QUnit 2.x"
[04:40:59] <Cork> well it doesn't look like 2.0 exist yet
[04:41:06] <Cork> https://code.jquery.com/qunit/
[04:41:27] <Cork> uh
[04:41:32] <Cork> wtf
[04:41:39] <Cork> "We should have a migration guide to the QUnit 2.0 APIs ready for the 1.16 release"
[04:41:42] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/issues/86
[04:41:56] <Cork> so 2.0 is for the api not the package release??
[04:43:00] <mightyiam> It is probably meant for a future 2.x, which doesn't even have a branch yet
[04:43:12] <Cork> sounds weird
[04:43:58] <mightyiam> So does typeof null
[04:44:06] <Cork> :D
[04:47:23] <endrem> how do I insert something after an id given a context? E.g $( newLegend, currentLegend ).after('#k243'); should insert newLegend after id=k243 into currentLegend but it doesnt work.
[04:47:50] <Cork> endrem: $( newLegend, currentLegend ).after($('#k243'));
[04:48:01] <Cork> though it is the other way around
[04:48:16] <Cork> endrem: $('#k243').after($( newLegend, currentLegend ));
[04:48:37] <Cork> or $( newLegend, currentLegend ).insertAfter($('#k243'));
[04:49:02] <Cork> ah $() isn't needed there
[04:49:07] <Cork> $( newLegend, currentLegend ).insertAfter('#k243');
[04:49:35] <Cork> endrem: wait a min after into?
[04:49:44] <Cork> endrem: you don't need to scope when you use ids
[04:49:50] <Cork> as they are page unique
[04:50:12] <Cork> so $('#k243').after(newLegend);
[04:50:22] <sammich> supposed to be unique*
[04:50:28] <Cork> has to be
[04:50:37] <endrem> cork: jQuery(newLegend, currentLegend).insertAfter( jQuery( '#k243' ) ); gives empty object
[04:50:41] <Cork> and id can only ever match only one element
[04:51:06] <Cork> endrem: ya, cause newLegent isn't a selector
[04:51:09] <sammich> that's because getElementById returns the first id
[04:51:16] <Cork> so jquery gets confused
[04:51:31] <Cork> sammich: its cause the hash in the system only allow on element per id match
[04:51:33] <sammich> newLegend could be a string in a var
[04:51:42] <endrem> and jQuery( '#k243' ).after( jQuery(newLegend, currentLegend) ); returns only newLegend...
[04:51:52] <Cork> endrem: again what is jQuery(newLegend, currentLegend)?
[04:52:02] <endrem> var newLegend = '<div id=k240>we</div>';
[04:52:10] <endrem> var currentLegend = '<div><div id="k243">adf</div><div id="k244">bc</div></div>';
[04:52:10] <Cork> O_o'
[04:52:24] <Cork> oook, so what exactly are you trying to do?
[04:52:41] <endrem> insert 240 after 243
[04:53:13] <Cork> and is any part of this in the dom?
[04:53:22] <Cork> or is it all html?
[04:53:29] <Cork> + strings
[04:53:42] <sammich> Cork: querySelectorAll('#blah') ;)
[04:53:47] <endrem> just strings - html fragments
[04:53:54] <Cork> sammich: will only give you the first instance
[04:54:06] <sammich> I made sure
[04:54:11] <Cork> endrem: ok then you first have to parse currentLegend
[04:54:23] <Cork> and store the document fragment

[04:55:17] <Cork> endrem: var domCurrentLegend = $(currentLegend); domCurrentLegend.find('#k240).after(newLegend);
[04:55:50] <endrem> how do I parse currentLegend? Can I not query it directly - as I can do: jQuery(currentLegend).find('div');
[04:55:58] <Cork> i just gave you how
[04:56:31] <Cork> endrem: you can, but after the .after() the newly created document fragment won't be referenced
[04:56:39] <Cork> and you will lose all the changes
[04:56:52] <Cork> endrem: jquery works with dom elements, not html
[04:57:05] <Cork> so it doesn't modify the unparsed string for you
[04:58:41] <endrem> var domCurrentLegend = jQuery(currentLegend); var updated = domCurrentLegend.find('#k240').after(newLegend); still only returns newLegend
[04:59:04] <Cork> endrem: the second var isn't needed
[04:59:18] <Cork> the first one parses the html into a document fragment
[04:59:23] <Cork> you later modify this fragment
[04:59:39] <Cork> .find() looks into the fragment and returns a subsection
[04:59:50] <Cork> that is why you can't save the result from there, as you will lose the rest
[05:00:04] <Cork> and .after should return 240 not 243
[05:00:44] <baako> hi guys how do I remove li with the id which is in the data-id stored in the array http://kopy.io/85piv
[05:01:47] <Cork> baako: $('#' + $(elm).data('id')).remove()
[05:02:20] <Cork> or wait...
[05:02:29] <Cork> ugg you have indentation errors
[05:03:28] <Cork> not sure why you use both this.id and status
[05:03:32] <Cork> when it is the same value
[05:04:09] <Cork> ugg
[05:04:27] <sammich> why not use an Id as #user_+ <user Id>
[05:04:34] <Cork> baako: why are you overcomplicating it like this?
[05:04:35] <sammich> then you just hit it up quickly for removal
[05:04:53] <Cork> just replace the element in the dom if it exists
[05:04:57] <Cork> you don't need the array
[05:05:01] <baako> Cork: i want to remove the <li data-id> which id is not in the array
[05:05:21] <Cork> baako: so just build a new set of elements
[05:05:29] <Cork> and replace all of the content in the list
[05:05:42] <Cork> as that is what you do anyway
[05:05:55] <Cork> you want to touch the dom as little as possible
[05:06:02] <Cork> as that is expensive
[05:06:07] <baako> what Cork?
[05:06:26] <Cork> baako: in the loop create the elements and push them into an array
[05:06:40] <Cork> after your loop is done $('#target').html(listOfElements)
[05:07:24] <Cork> you can even reuse the existing elements if you want
[05:07:42] <baako> Cork: look at the code
[05:07:51] <Cork> i have
[05:08:48] <baako> Cork: in the first part before the else if. I am displaying the li which is not in the array
[05:08:53] <baako> in the else if
[05:09:09] <baako> i now want to remove the li which id is not in the loop
[05:09:21] <sammich> oops, I didn't know jQuery could append a vanilla array of DOMElements
[05:09:59] <sammich> baako: Cork is suggesting you rewrite the code so that's it's simpler/better/faster
[05:10:33] <baako> sammich: so more or less create a new function for it
[05:10:56] <sammich> well, rewriting it, yes
[05:11:12] <sammich> it'll be about 5 lines all up, or there abouts
[05:11:30] <baako> sammich: will show u
[05:11:33] <baako> 2 mins
[05:14:19] <baako> sammich: and Cork http://kopy.io/SJkvr
[05:14:49] <sammich> now you've got no online users
[05:15:13] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/3crzwa49/
[05:15:37] <baako> sammich: thats the old one
[05:15:47] <baako> http://kopy.io/SJkvr
[05:16:27] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/3crzwa49/2/
[05:17:01] <sammich> baako: do you know what's happening in that ^?
[05:17:38] <baako> sammich: nope i cant see that
[05:18:05] <sammich> you're rebuilding the entire online userlist each time you refresh
[05:19:03] <baako> sammich: so i dont need onlineCustomers() ?
[05:19:27] <sammich> you're still calling the update function. I just happened to rename it
[05:20:06] <baako> sammich: i woulnt use this rebuld because they way the other one work was look in the array for new id and then add the image
[05:20:20] <baako> this one looks like will just remove them all and add them back
[05:20:40] <baako> will look like a message when over 100 users are online
[05:20:43] <sammich> the result is the same
[05:22:17] <baako> doesnt seem to be working
[05:23:16] <baako> remember sammich $.get reads json
[05:23:47] <sammich> (not really, the newest users are on top in your version)
[05:23:52] <sammich> $.getJSON
[05:26:42] <baako> sammich:  Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[05:26:51] <baako> anyways will try and figure it out

[05:30:37] <MeaCoder> hi,i search for a free simple jquery drop-down menu.... (where can i download a simple light free drop-down menu)????
[05:46:04] <DjMadness> is there a jquery equiviliant of document.execCommand for contenteditable items ?
[05:51:04] <Cork> DjMadness: what's wrong with document.execCommand?
[05:52:10] <DjMadness> Cork: in some browsers it behaves differently (they do different stuff)
[05:52:26] <Cork> DjMadness: ah, you want a compatibility interface?
[05:52:34] <Cork> you would have to look for a plugin for that
[05:52:55] <DjMadness> ah okays.
[06:01:15] <tdelam> How do I disable all <button> within a table row when a link is clicked?
[06:01:55] <mbrzuzy> $('tr button').attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[06:01:58] <Cork> no
[06:02:01] <Cork> prop not attr
[06:02:07] <tdelam> prop!
[06:02:11] <tdelam> ahh, my bad
[06:02:11] <Cork> prop('disabled', true)
[06:02:18] <mbrzuzy> aha Cork, you got me again :)
[06:02:19] <tdelam> thanks Cork I knew this :(
[06:04:46] <mbrzuzy> Cork, are properties essentially the boolean type values? disabled, autocomplete, etc?
[06:04:50] <mbrzuzy> checked
[06:05:11] <Cork> mbrzuzy: prop means properties on the element elm[prop]
[06:05:31] <Cork> while attribute is the raw string attribute from the element getAttribute(attr)
[06:05:44] <mbrzuzy> I see
[06:06:00] <Cork> mbrzuzy: best example is to compare $('a').attr('href') vs $('a').prop('href')
[06:06:01] <tdelam> I guess the issue is that it disables any row with <button>, perhaps I should do a better job explaining my issue.
[06:06:21] <Cork> tdelam: $(this).closest('tr').find('button').prop('disabled', true);
[06:06:40] <tdelam> I had that before... but I think i was using attr. Let me try it again
[06:06:48] <Cork> if the link is in the same row of the table tough
[06:06:55] <tdelam> yes, it is, Cork
[06:08:45] <mbrzuzy> prop and attr on href returned the same thing for me
[06:08:53] <tdelam> Cork: :) I owe you a beer, I guess I was using attr with my closest().find()
[06:09:52] <tdelam> $(this).closest('tr').find('button').prop('disabled', function (_, val) { return ! val; }); is what i ended with for toggling disable true/false

[06:10:51] <Ice_Strike> How to get a value from data-slide-index attribute? For example: <div class="pager-container"> <a data-slide-index="0"> .. </a> </div>
[06:10:52] <Cork> to toggle it you mean=
[06:10:54] <Cork> *?
[06:11:02] <tdelam> yes
[06:11:08] <Cork> Ice_Strike: .data('slide-index')
[06:11:27] <Ice_Strike> $(".pager-container, a[data-slide-index]").mouseenter(function() { val = this.val(); alert(val); });
[06:11:28] <Cork> tdelam: interesting, didn't know prop took a function
[06:11:37] <Cork> Ice_Strike: .data('slide-index')
[06:11:46] <Cork> and $(this) not this
[06:11:57] <tdelam> Cork: yea, I wrote this code before, I can't believe I was using attr. Brainblankage this morning.
[06:12:11] <BillCriswell> If you're looking for a[data-slide-index] inside .pager-container you don't want a , either.
[06:12:11] <b-ot> BillCriswell: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[06:12:16] <Ice_Strike> Cork I want to hover on pager-container and then get a data-slide-index value
[06:12:16] <BillCriswell> `read
[06:12:16] <b-ot> BillCriswell: From gnarf, 10h 7m ago: the "scroll" event can't be dispatched by the browser until "the frame after" the JS scrolled it --- (requestAnimationFrame || setTimeout)(function() { scrolling=false; }); should do it
[06:12:26] <tdelam> toggles my row on and off now without a problem, i am able to toggle forms wrapped din fieldsets now as well, which is what i need.
[06:12:33] <tdelam> Cork: thanks for your help!
[06:12:33] <BillCriswell> Ah, just got your message gnarf. Thanks.
[06:14:22] <Ice_Strike> BillCriswell Yes,
[06:14:48] <Ice_Strike> BillCriswell I want to get a value from data-slide-index when I hover class="pager-container"
[06:14:52] <mbrzuzy> Thanks for the example Cork.  I understand now
[06:15:16] <BillCriswell> When you enter an <a> that's inside .pager-container you mean?
[06:15:48] <Cork> mbrzuzy: an even better example is http://jsfiddle.net/1he4oxmv/2/
[06:16:14] <Ice_Strike> BillCriswell Yes
[06:16:20] <Cork> $($('a').attr('href')).show() vs $($('a').prop('href')).show()
[06:16:34] <mbrzuzy> nice !
[06:16:42] <BillCriswell> Then you want $('.pager-container a[data-slide-index]')
[06:16:52] <Ice_Strike> Ah

[06:43:08] <mr_highway> hi!
[06:43:17] <mr_highway> http://pastebin.com/LsRVyEFV whats wrong with this function?
[06:43:40] <Cork> mr_highway: ##javascript
[06:45:28] <kqr> I'm assuming the answer is a pretty clear "no", but I'll try anyway: is it possible to refer to elements that are adjacent to the script element that is doing the referring?
[06:45:55] <Cork> kqr: sure, if you can get a hold of that element
[06:46:02] <Cork> the script tag i mean
[06:46:15] <kqr> ah but that's not possible from within the script tag unless you give it a unique ID or whatever?
[06:46:32] <Cork> you don't run "from within"
[06:46:42] <Cork> the script tag is just a way to deliver the script text to the browser
[06:46:51] <kqr> that's what I was afraid of
[06:46:53] <Cork> js doesn't have a context relation to the dom
[06:46:55] <kqr> thanks
[06:47:06] <kqr> I'll see if I can get some kind of id :)
[06:47:45] <Cork> kqr: another option is something a little ugly as $('script[src*="name-of-script.js"])
[06:47:50] <Cork> *$('script[src*="name-of-script.js"]')
[06:49:01] <faraway> BillCriswell: I updated my code to detect the scroll reason a bit: http://jsfiddle.net/tndev/ypjruLfc/1/
[06:54:17] <Cryp71c> I'm using $.post but if I look in the chrome dev tools, the request is a $.get
[06:54:19] <Cryp71c> Why?
[06:55:27] <faraway> I try to create some parlax scrolling, it works fine in FF and Chrome.
[06:55:28] <faraway> But in Safari 8.x it seems as if the scroll event and the scrollY of the window are not always in sync. As if on of them is update of scrollY is delayed.
[06:55:52] <faraway> Does anyone know what could be the reason for this?
[06:59:53] <BillCriswell> faraway: http://jsbin.com/hulese/5/edit?js,output is what I had to do to detect it.
[07:00:41] <BillCriswell> That 20ms seems to be the lowest it can go. 10 is even too fast for some reason.
[07:01:04] <faraway> BillCriswell: Yes I had a look at it. But as I was looking for a more general aproach, and it seems to work quite well.
[07:04:01] <BillCriswell> I hear ya.
[07:11:34] <MikeD_> jquery map or native array map?  how do you decide which to use?
[07:14:21] <BillCriswell> If I'm working with a jQuery collection, $foo.map()
[07:14:37] <BillCriswell> Otherwise .map()
[07:14:53] <BillCriswell> Unless I need to support old browsers, then I'll use $.map throughout.
[07:15:04] <MikeD_> heh, stated like that i guess it's pretty obvious
[07:15:50] <BillCriswell> I used it for everything before IE caught up.
[07:16:52] <MikeD_> is it 'better' (for some definition of better) to use jquery methods throughout a codebase for the sake of consistency?
[07:17:08] <BillCriswell> I'm no good with those kinds of questions haha
[07:17:23] <MikeD_> since the signatures are almost completely opposite each other, it seems like it'd be jarring to see "map" used in two different ways
[07:21:24] <NoiseEee> MikeD_: yeah i've been bit by that before

I mean, I have a If() {...} else {...} statement and it would be much easier if could ave used something like this if(condition) {//return frm handler} skiping the else branchand making my code more flat. Is this possible?
[07:25:32] <kqr> krambiorix, not explaining your problem, for starts
[07:28:44] <ashka> are $('input[type=file]').filestyle() and $('input[type=file]').each(function() { $(this).filestyle(); }); equivalent ?

[08:34:43] <zeroquake> is event.stoppropagation supported in IE7?
[08:36:47] <NoiseEee> zeroquake: yes, but it's stopPropogation()

[08:55:19] <BillCriswell> Which felt weird, but I think it's good enough lol
[08:55:56] <BillCriswell> It's weird though, 10ms it only happens sometimes, so there must be some really hairy stuff going on.
[08:56:55] <BillCriswell> gnarf: http://jsbin.com/hulese/7/edit I hit "Run With JS" here about 20 times, got the message 4 times.

[09:03:47] <gnarf> BillCriswell: think i lost a message the first one was "which felt weird"
[09:04:13] <BillCriswell> Before that I said: gnarf: It did, but I had to set a timeout of like 20ms
[09:05:07] <gnarf> BillCriswell: requestAnimationFrame seems to never have a problem
[09:05:45] <gnarf> BillCriswell: though the approach of what your doing in general I think I'd avoid
[09:06:12] <gnarf> animating scroll seems awesome, but like it's bad ux
[09:06:32] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I agree. I was helping someone else with an issue.

[10:15:15] <whirl3d> sry , I meant $("li").eq(3)[0].innerHTML= something.
[10:15:28] <whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/hp75k53h/17/
[10:15:36] <whirl3d> it's ugly, sorry
[10:15:57] <lexmihaylov> try using nt-child selector
[10:16:06] <whirl3d> I figure I could probably do it with one regex line, but no luck yet
[10:16:28] <whirl3d> I'm referencing the element inside of an each loop
[10:16:49] <whirl3d> line 39, 40 are exactly the same
[10:17:07] <whirl3d> but 40 should be the <li></li> element
[10:18:20] <lexmihaylov> whirl3d, could you send a fiddle
[10:18:25] <shoky> whirl3d .html() is the same as .innerHTML
[10:18:28] <whirl3d> I did
[10:18:56] <whirl3d> how do I set the contents of my li element's html then?
[10:19:14] <whirl3d> I want the text inside the li element.
[10:19:16] <shoky> with either of those.. don't undersand the issue
[10:19:47] <whirl3d> I'm losing my <li> elements. they disappear when I set their innerHTML to <span>..yadayada</span>
[10:20:02] <shoky> no, they're still there..
[10:20:18] <shoky> logging .html() is just logging the .innerHTML
[10:20:32] <whirl3d> Where'd the bullet points go?
[10:20:49] <shoky> there were no bullet points to begin with ;P
[10:20:59] <whirl3d> omg, I swear there were.
[10:21:00] <whirl3d> lol
[10:21:08] <shoky> you've got the "Normalized CSS" checkbox checked in Fiddle Options
[10:21:32] <whirl3d> <--still brain damaged. Sorry.
[10:21:37] <shoky> lol
[10:21:54] <shoky> well, not lol if that's true ;)
[10:22:12] <whirl3d> What is pathetic is that this was all just to ask a bigger question.
[10:22:23] <shoky> gotta start small
[10:22:34] <whirl3d> I'm trying to find ever word combination for a telephone number
[10:22:48] <shoky> ;-o
[10:23:49] <whirl3d> So I thought if I styled the letters for each of the 10 positions, It'd be easier to describe the universal set I am trying to make. What a mess.
[10:27:58] <sniperh4x0r_> if i want to select an element with that has two classes in it how do i do that?
[10:28:10] <sinious> .class1.class2
[10:28:55] <sniperh4x0r_> derp i pretty much knew that but didnt realize i only did that to my console.log ~_~
[10:28:57] <sniperh4x0r_> thanks
[10:29:14] <shoky> sinious it's normal that you get the OPTIONS request first, if it's a cross-domain request. you have no control over that
[10:29:38] <sinious> it's a CORS request yes.. so I can't disable it even if I know the RESTful service supports the method I want aye?
[10:29:53] <shoky> sinious tho maybe if you don't use any custom http headers it might not send the options, iirc
[10:29:56] <sinious> they don't have their OPTIONS response set up for CORS but do have POST/GET.. PITA
[10:30:58] <sinious> I'm only adding a progress listener on the $.ajaxSettings.xhr
[10:31:50] <sinious> otherwise just url/type/data.. not setting header or xhrFields.. it just loves to send the OPTIONS
[10:32:25] <cjohnson> whirl3d: tip: just ask the bigger question first, always
[10:32:31] <cjohnson> the lead up questions may end up being a complete waste
[10:32:36] <shoky>  a request is preflighted if:  ... if POST is used to send request data with a Content-Type other than application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain  ... or:  It sets custom headers in the request (e.g. the request uses a header such as X-PINGOTHER)
[10:32:46] <shoky> sinious ^
[10:33:02] <StanAccy> What's the JS event that fires when you hover over an element - is it 'hover' or 'onmouseover' ?
[10:33:49] <sinious> shoky: I'm using multipart/form-data as I'm attempting to upload an image and I'm not setting any custom headers, unless binding to progress is considered that :/
[10:33:52] <sinious> thanks for that info though
[10:35:12] <Es0teric> hey, quick logic question: http://pastebin.com/dTutRriA when the input field is populated with data that was already saved, how do i get $galleryInput to change the input val to ‘’ when the user deletes the current val thats already there?
[10:36:05] <sinious> StanAccy: 'mouseover', reference: (scroll down a bit): http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-MouseEvent
[10:36:26] <StanAccy> sinious: THanks - now that seems to fire continuously as the user moves the mouse over the same element - is that expected?
[10:36:44] <StanAccy> and by continuously I mean every time the mouse cursor moves within the element
[10:39:46] <sinious> StanAccy: it just fires when you go over the object you bind it to once, however you may have things inside that object that block it and you don't realize your mouse is leaving the object and re-entering it as you mouse over child items
[10:40:24] <StanAccy> so I should be expecting a single event, and the fact that I get a series of events as I move the mouse around within the element likely means Ive got another issue masking it?
[10:41:20] <sinious> other elements are having the event propagate to them
[10:41:45] <StanAccy> not at the moment.
[10:42:09] <StanAccy> I do see the image flickering though so I suspect its being updated somehow
[10:42:20] <StanAccy> and I get repeat events every time the images is being replaced
[10:42:28] <StanAccy> thanks for the suggestion!
[10:45:35] <Es0teric> can anyone help me real quick, please?
[10:46:24] <baako|away> hi guys i want remove a li data-id ONLY IF the id(<li data-id="1">) is not in the array(statues). i am trying like this http://kopy.io/WWHMP
[10:46:51] <baako> but the else if doesnt do that why?
[10:47:17] <cjohnson> I don't see an else if?
[10:48:24] <Es0teric> http://pastebin.com/dTutRriA when the input field is populated with data that was already saved, how do i get $galleryInput to change the input val to ‘’ when the user deletes the current val thats already there?
[10:48:29] <baako> cjohnson: http://kopy.io/OJPMe
[10:50:15] <baako> dont worry about the if statement because he if statement just loops over the array and display the id in data-id
[10:50:58] <baako> but what i want to do now is similar remove the li if the value in <li data-id is not in the array
[10:51:49] <cjohnson> baako: http://jsfiddle.net/cqvs0rtw/
[10:52:51] <baako> cjohnson: what?
[10:53:07] <cjohnson> This is how I would approach it
[10:53:16] <cjohnson> instead of trying to manually loop through things, just build a better selector
[10:53:56] <cjohnson> better yet remove $( and ) from the return line and let it just return the selector so you can use it as a filter to $('li')
[10:54:53] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/cqvs0rtw/1/
[10:55:29] <baako> cjohnson: but how do i remove the li?
[10:55:38] <cjohnson> .remove()
[10:56:13] <baako> i dont understand it.
[10:56:25] <baako> why r u doing with var selector?
[10:56:55] <cjohnson> baako: so you would do, with my function:  $('li').filter( selectorByDataAttr('id', statuses) ).remove()
[10:57:13] <cjohnson> that would remove all li elements who have a data-id in statuses
[10:58:20] <cjohnson> basically I'm taking each item from statuses, turning it into [data-id=ITEM], and then combining that. so if var statuses = ['3', '4', '7'] selectorByDataAttr returns [data-id=3],[data-id=4],[data-id=7]
[10:58:25] <baako> cjohnson: http://kopy.io/BW6Vp this is what i am doign to get the id from the array and display the image. this also makes sure that i am not displaying the same image if the id already exists.
[10:58:44] <baako> so what i am trying to do next is remove the image is the id is not in the array
[10:59:48] <cjohnson> right, so after your $.each
[10:59:59] <cjohnson> that's where you'd put the line I gave above
[11:02:16] <cjohnson> baako: http://jsfiddle.net/v1Lqasb9/
[11:02:38] <cjohnson> actually http://jsfiddle.net/v1Lqasb9/1/
[11:03:11] <cjohnson> one more quick fix (you never declared statuses): http://jsfiddle.net/v1Lqasb9/2/
[11:03:56] <Es0teric> baako: are you using laravel by any chance?
[11:04:01] <hlvwrk> hey uh
[11:04:06] <baako> Es0teric: yep
[11:04:11] <hlvwrk> any known issues with nvd3 and the latest version of firefox?
[11:04:16] <Es0teric> baako: niiice… laravel is one of my fav mvc frameworks
[11:04:21] <hlvwrk> (sorry asking here, just figured i'm here anyways)
[11:04:50] <islalobo> I have a form (registration) with a jquery action that fires on .submit to load a popup block. My issue is that the popup block is a form as well and it is interrupting the submit of the registration form.
[11:05:09] <Es0teric> but either way, my question is mainly a logic issue
[11:05:13] <Es0teric> so can anyone help me out real quick?
[11:05:18] <baako> cjohnson: thanks but that just seem to stop the other codes from displaying the li
[11:05:27] <cjohnson> baako: ?
[11:06:41] <sinious> islalobo: is the first form being submitted changing the page or are you return false;ing so you don't leave the page?
[11:09:05] <baako> cjohnson: sorry for the late reply but before i added your code. http://kopy.io/rtELZ used to display an image
[11:09:18] <baako> but when i addded your code it doesnt display an image
[11:09:42] <baako> which means i cant test to see if you code is working
[11:09:46] <cjohnson> all I added were the 3 lines at the end removing the lis whose data-id wasn't in the list you wrote
[11:09:47] <islalobo> sinious: I mean, it doesn't change the page, however I haven't included a return as such in my code. The href= that the block pulls from is href="#div-that-is-hidden"  i.e. a block in a hidden region....
[11:10:15] <islalobo> sinious: but the registration form and the block popup have separate submit functions defined
[11:10:36] <cjohnson> baako: the rest is your code
[11:10:46] <sinious> islalobo: are you putting an action="" in your <form>?
[11:10:47] <islalobo> I think what I want to do is to use the second form to change or append more information to the first form — that isn't what I'm currently doing
[11:11:02] <islalobo> sinious: no
[11:12:09] <islalobo> sinious: but the registration submit function, if successful, will log the user into the site. And there is something else that controls what page users land once they have logged in
[11:12:26] <sinious> islalobo: I don't know what your needs are but if you intend to inject more content into the existing form then I'd simply do that, keeping the same <form> intact, before allowing it to ever run a submit. Just use regular type="button"s to invoke methods to inject more of your form content as you progress
[11:12:35] <islalobo> fyi our site uses Drupal. This is a mix of a module called 'webforms' and some custom forms that I've made
[11:13:30] <islalobo> sinious: does type=button use the same type of submit function? I am at a bit of a loss of how to target a button type button to perform some type of action
[11:14:04] <cjohnson> type=button will not submit the form
[11:14:13] <islalobo> cjohnson: I know
[11:14:20] <cjohnson> give it an id and bind to its onclick
[11:14:31] <baako> cjohnson: so i did an else if http://kopy.io/t0HO7 but your code removes all the li
[11:14:34] <cjohnson> then onclick, show dialogs or whatever, let them inject the extra stuff into the form
[11:14:37] <islalobo> But I'm wondering how do I target a type=button to trigger something like a popup block (to then append information and submit the form)
[11:14:41] <checkit> Hey guys. I'm having some trouble pushing data sets into my object. Can anyone point out what might be wrong with the following (short) example: http://jsfiddle.net/1w8jbmbo/
[11:14:45] <baako> including the ones in the array
[11:15:27] <cjohnson> baako: I think you need to spend more time with thiscode. you don't seem to have a good grasp of even what you had to begin with
[11:15:27] <sinious> islalobo: you can do it several ways.. since this is #jQuery then just add a class or id to the button and bind it.. <button type="button" id="load2">Load Page 2</button> .. $('#load2').click(function....);
[11:15:37] <cjohnson> you put my lines in the wrong place. I told you to put htem after the .each
[11:16:00] <cjohnson> the else if doesn't make any sense here
[11:16:04] <baako> cjohnson: yes i did BUT it didnt work
[11:16:14] <cjohnson> right. because the code is wrong
[11:16:22] <cjohnson> so you need to figure out what's going on and fix that first
[11:16:25] <baako> it killed the rest of the code. i have been spending 2 days on this
[11:16:40] <islalobo> sinious: this is what we have and what I'm thinking you're saying (top is original / bottom is an approximation of what I'll need) https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a31cd67b7f346b03ab83
[11:16:56] <sinious> islalobo: you should have a look at $.ajax or $.get in jQuery API, very easy with examples of how to grab data and inject it into your page
[11:17:04] <cjohnson> you'll have to spend more, I'm not sure what to tell you
[11:17:19] <cjohnson> it didn't "kill the rest of the code". You wrote it wrong and put it in the wrong place
[11:17:47] <islalobo> sinious: I'll look into it
[11:18:58] <baako> cjohnson: this is what you did http://kopy.io/rngAl
[11:19:05] <sinious> islalobo: If the form content really isn't that long or you have no reason to restrict it from the user I'd just place that content in your form and hide it until you're ready to show it so you don't need to use any AJAX at all
[11:19:32] <cjohnson> baako: Right. I added the 3 lines after the rest of your code. Your code adds all the images, and then mine removes any of them that aren't in your statuses list
[11:20:00] <cjohnson> you can console.log(nodesNotInList) to see evrything it's selecting to remove
[11:20:14] <cjohnson> you can console.log(selectors) to see exactly which selector it's using to select the elements
[11:20:33] <Es0teric> so can anyone help me out real quick?
[11:21:33] <baako> cjohnson: http://kopy.io/gHbpD
[11:22:00] <cjohnson> first line what?
[11:22:27] <baako> cjohnson: of the console go
[11:22:30] <baako> log
[11:22:39] <baako> selector shows "[data-id='1']", "[data-id='2']"]
[11:22:54] <cjohnson> ok. you added a console.log(something), never told me what something was, and gave me the output
[11:23:02] <cjohnson> so what are these two outputs?
[11:23:57] <cjohnson> oh bah add .join(',') to the end of the selectors line
[11:24:02] <baako> cjohnson: "you can console.log(nodesNotInList) to see "
[11:24:02] <cjohnson> not sure where that went to
[11:24:18] <cjohnson> baako: right, but you have two entirely different outputs here. so I'm not sure which corresponds to what
[11:24:38] <cjohnson> anyway I think the missing .join is the issue
[11:25:38] <devkinetic> I am not a jquery pro, I'm trying to use selectors to attach a click event to an input of type submit. It works in my fiddle, but not on my site. http://jsfiddle.net/396fs2rv/ http://zipcodepopup.dev.o4419664333.v19a.nyc.host8.biz/tree-care-service-search
[11:25:51] <baako> cjohnson: .join (',') to a function
[11:25:54] <baako> ?
[11:26:24] <baako> you mean .join to the nodesNotInList?
[11:26:56] <cjohnson> < cjohnson> oh bah add .join(',') to the end of the selectors line
[11:30:28] <_DB> hey anyone know a plugin that gives me a list of cities and countries around the world?
[11:33:56] <checkit> Hey guys. I'm having some trouble pushing data sets into my object. Can anyone point out what might be wrong with the following (short) example: http://jsfiddle.net/1w8jbmbo/
[11:38:26] <baako> cjohnson: :( still dont remove the li
[11:38:39] <baako> i added .join (',') btw
[11:38:47] <baako> var selectors = statuses.map(function(v) { return "[data-id='" + v + "']"; }).join(',');
[11:39:27] <islalobo> sinious: like instead of having a block that is hidden in a region, have a form fieldset (or something) that is hidden until <input type=button id=#button> is clicked
[11:41:13] <devkinetic> $("#zip-search-page input[type='submit']").val() isn't working for me. I have no idea why this isn't working on my development site. Can someone look at my page and help me figure ut this seemingly simple selector?
[11:41:24] <sinious> islalobo: right, something a little less 'modal' than a colorbox floating up.. I never dug into that plugins code to see if it's generating a new element to display or not.. if it is, it won't be part of your <form>.. but if it doesn't and you really do want a modal (dim out the screen and present a box the user must deal with) then put that colorbox markup inside your <form>> ... </form>
[11:42:15] <islalobo> sinious: hrm, I don't like the idea of moving away from the colorbox solution. It is only solution that has worked to get a colorbox to appear
[11:45:00] <islalobo> I mean, I'll consider it of course it allows the form to complete easily. Just the thought exhausts me… :/
[11:45:02] <Rudeboy> Hey guys, how would I do the following: if($('select[name="post_type"]').val() === 'example1'OR'example2){
[11:45:07] <Rudeboy> OR being the keyword :)
[11:45:21] <sinious> islalobo: then use it. If it has form data you need then either copy it over to hidden inputs in your existing form, generate hidden inputs with the values, or simply use jQuery's AJAX data field and supply the values yourself when you're ready to submit
[11:46:03] <cjohnson> baako: console.log selectors and nodesNotInlist now that you've added the change
[11:46:15] <cjohnson> see hwat they say. keep digging. keep debugging
[11:46:22] <cjohnson> don't just say "it doesn't work", find out why
[11:49:59] <sinious> Rudeboy: something like if ($('select[name="post_type"]').val().toString().match(/example[12]/)) { // do stuff }
[11:51:39] <Rudeboy> sinious: Thank you, will play around with that and see what comes of it:)
[11:52:52] <sinious> Rudeboy: yw, anything inside the [12] is considered a separate matchable character.. you can do ranges, e.g. 0-99 can be [0-9]{1,2} (1 or 2 numbers from 0 to 99)
[11:55:12] <cordovafan8> Hello all. Is there a way to prevent jquery mobile reloading the previous page on dialog('close')? Currently I am fetching the dialog with mobile.changePage().
[11:58:16] <baako> cjohnson: selectors [data-id='1'],[data-id='2']  nodesNotInlist [prevObject: x.fn.x.init[2], context: document, jquery: "1.10.2", constructor: function, init: function…] context: document length: 0 prevObject: x.fn.x.init[2] __proto__: Object[0]
[12:04:46] <islalobo> thanks sinious, i'm going to try that

[14:42:08] <artur99> Hi
[14:42:28] <artur99> i would like how to get the height of an image immediately after it loads
[14:42:52] <artur99> i tried this: $("#img").load(function () { a = $("#projimgch").height(); }
[14:43:01] <artur99> but got the height 0
[14:43:25] <artur99> if i try it in console, after a few seconds after the page is loaded, i get the right height
[14:43:31] <artur99> but its now working like that
[14:43:33] <artur99> why?
[14:44:16] <artur99> anyone?
[14:54:13] <nerb_> i'm pretty new to coding, and i'm having a tough time understanding whether i don't understand the replaceWith() function or if Chrome dev tools are just slightly misleading.
[14:54:34] <nerb_> i've got a span with class 'current-selection' which is just coloring a portion of a <p>
[14:54:45] <nerb_> i'm trying to remove the span and place the original text in the <p>
[14:54:54] <nerb_> the line i'm using is $(".current-selection").replaceWith($(".current-selection").text());
[14:55:11] <nerb_> from the way i understand it, i'm actually getting rid of the span from the DOM
[14:55:24] <nerb_> but the elements displayed in the chrome dev tools don't change
[14:55:33] <nerb_> and i can't tell if i'm actually affecting the DOM at all
[14:55:52] <nerb_> would love a quick explanation of this if someone has a moment
[15:07:21] <kevireilly> nerb_: it does seem to work like you expect. Can you perhaps produce or modify the following example to demonstrate the behavior you're seeing? http://jsfiddle.net/t7ajwvzx/
[15:18:25] <nerb_> kevireilly, i think that the jsfiddle example is consistent with what i'm seeing because the span won't disappear
[15:18:58] <nerb_> oh wait, i take it back
[15:19:00] <kevireilly> nerb_: hrm? for me the span disappears
[15:19:03] <nerb_> i see
[15:19:12] <nerb_> sorry, i got confused
[15:19:16] <kevireilly> no worries
[15:19:28] <strayArch> How can I look up how the default behavior of a browser :( I've been stuck on this chrome problem forever ...
[15:22:12] <kevireilly> strayArch: there are feature detection frameworks like modernizr, but what is the problem?
[15:22:29] <kevireilly> *libraries
[15:23:18] <strayArch> It only occurs on mobile, but when I dropdown a menu, and then click the page which has overflow content, the view-port/content doesn't handle in a way that I would like :S
[15:23:49] <strayArch> Only occurs on mobile probably b/c that is the only place I have a topbar menu xD
[15:24:05] <kevireilly> strayArch: hrm. Are you using some dev tools as part of the evaluation?
[15:24:48] <strayArch> kevireilly: Yes, not with much luck though... I am learning as I go :S
[15:24:51] <strayArch> stronz.co/#portfolio
[15:25:06] <strayArch> firefox handles it as I expect though
[15:25:37] <kevireilly> strayArch: I meant dev tools on the mobile device or a remote debugger more specifically
[15:25:50] <strayArch> I've been using chrome dev-tools
[15:26:05] <strayArch> The problem occurs on my actualy mobile phone as well
[15:26:12] <strayArch> actual*
[15:27:34] <strayArch> I will give modernizr a try, I've been rather stumped
[15:28:34] <kevireilly> strayArch: not sure that will help and I've not got any ideas based on the description. While it most definitely could just be a cross-browser thing, one thing that comes to mind is validation
[15:29:45] <kevireilly> as in have you tried validating your page and fixing warnings/errors. Sometimes cross-browser behavior can be affected by invalid HTML definitions and things of that nature
[15:30:03] <kevireilly> sometimes as simple as not defining a doctype as an example
[15:31:35] <strayArch> kevireilly: I have been to the best of my knowledge --- there still improvements to be made though. The biggest take I guess is that when the page loads on chrome browser it loads the to the center of the page. On firefox it loads at the top.
[15:32:37] <kevireilly> strayArch: you've ran your page through something like http://validator.w3.org ?
[15:33:43] <strayArch> kevireilly: apparently not o.o "993 Errors, 9 warning(s)" I used an extension xD
[15:36:43] <kevireilly> strayArch: I'd probably start there :) but that is possibly because I'm not sure I fully understand the issue and would be looking for more general explanations
[15:38:18] <bigwax> Can I bind an on change event listener to the form itself, or just the inputs
[15:40:39] <strayArch> kevireilly: thank you :) It's probably bad style somewhere causing the problem
[15:41:17] <kevireilly> bigwax: should be able to. Note that with a text input as an example, the change event is only emitted after you remove focus from the input
[15:41:39] <bigwax> i see
[15:41:45] <kevireilly> strayArch: no problem. It could also be a huge waste of time, but isn't a bad idea in general
[15:42:46] <bigwax> kevireilly: i can use keyup instead
[15:43:01] <kevireilly> bigwax: yes indeedie
[15:44:23] <kevireilly> bigwax: what was the goal actually? that part was missing
[15:44:27] <strayArch> kevireilly: Time enjoyed wasted isn't waster ^_^
[15:44:33] <kevireilly> I think I know now based on the keyup statement, just curious
[15:44:59] <kevireilly> strayArch: true!
[15:45:08] <bigwax> i have a few select option inputs and i'd like to update the ajax response once they select a different filter
[15:45:13] <bigwax> automatically
[15:46:23] <kevireilly> bigwax: ah gotcha. A select option won't respond to a keyup though, no? I think that one specifically should respond to a change event when it is changed
[15:46:39] <bigwax> nah i was just responding to your text example
[15:46:47] <bigwax> im using the change event
[15:47:09] <kevireilly> oh ok
[15:47:47] <bigwax> ajax in wordpress was kind of a learning curve
[15:48:11] <bigwax> got it working though
[15:48:16] <kevireilly> sahweet
[15:48:38] <ciwolsey> is there a way to say 'fade out the clicked element' from within a click handler?
[15:48:50] <ciwolsey> the problem is i dont know the class name / id of what was clicked
[15:49:12] <bigwax> can you elaborate
[15:49:15] <bigwax> why dont you know the name
[15:49:41] <ciwolsey> im doing it from within one of meteorjs click handlers
[15:49:44] <kevireilly> ciwolsey: $('element').on('click', function(e){ $(this).fadeOut(); }); // or was it $(e.target)?
[15:49:49] <ciwolsey> the only thing passed into the callback is an event
[15:50:02] <ciwolsey> like function handler(event){
[15:50:13] <kevireilly> e.target is for sure the element that was clicked, that i know
[15:50:20] <Valduare> does jquery joyride   just not line up right on ios?
[15:50:29] <ciwolsey> but i cant seem to do e.target.fadeOut();
[15:50:35] <kevireilly> $(e.target).fadeOut()
[15:50:37] <bigwax> http://stackoverflow.com/a/9012576/1822096
[15:50:45] <ciwolsey> oh ;)
[15:50:48] <kevireilly> needs to be a jquery object since dom elements don't have jquery methods bound to them by default
[15:52:27] <ciwolsey> that works, thanks ;)
[15:52:31] <kevireilly> no prollem
[15:57:20] <spookah> i'm using a drag + drop on a div element.  That element also has "overflow: auto;".  When the content is too wide - I will get a horizontal scroll bar on the div.  But when I try to click+drag the scollbar - the jquery drag+drop event occurs and I can not scoll.  How should I handle this?
[16:03:20] <varchar> spookah, use the handle option.
[16:04:51] <varchar> http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#handle
[16:15:04] <t0astt> would doing a .val() on this <input name="short-answer-required" type="checkbox" value="1" id="short-answer-required"> while UNCHECKED return a 1?
[16:15:47] <Snerf> t0astt, I think it does
[16:15:58] <Snerf> you need to to if is(':checked')
[16:16:05] <reyley> yea
[16:16:08] <reyley> you have to do
[16:16:15] <reyley> .prop("checked")
[16:16:20] <reyley> not .val()
[16:16:25] <t0astt> ah ok
[16:16:35] <t0astt> Kinda mad I just now noticed that :P
[16:16:43] <t0astt> that it wasn't working right, that is
[16:16:45] <t0astt> thanks guys
[16:17:10] <t0astt> so that returns a 0 on unchecked, 1 on checked?
[16:17:31] <Snerf> or a true or false
[16:17:37] <Snerf> but ya
[16:17:41] <snover> not “or”, it’s a boolean
[16:24:55] <t0astt> Hmm. Still returning a 1 on an unchecked box.
[16:25:10] <Snerf> jfiddle yer code
[16:25:34] <t0astt> Ok. Let me just check my backend to make sure it's generating the checkbox correctly first
[16:27:20] <strayArch> kevireilly: No erros ^_^
[16:27:27] <t0astt> Alright, gimme a sec Snerf
[16:27:45] <kevireilly> strayArch: hooray! that was pretty quick and hopefully not too terrible? Guessing a lot were repeats and stuff
[16:28:54] <t0astt> Snerf: Didn't add the HTML because it sends the data via AJAX to a backend PHP controller. jFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/6a7fdf1r/
[16:29:12] <strayArch> kevireilly: about 980+ of them were how I had text pasted
[16:29:44] <Snerf> t0astt, then its kind of useless, isnt it
[16:29:48] <t0astt> Snerf: the offending code (at least right now) is the $('#short-answer-required')
[16:29:58] <strayArch> kevireilly: same problem though xD
[16:30:19] <Snerf> t0astt, need something that can be tested :)
[16:30:52] <reyley> t0astt: what the hell is this
[16:33:06] <t0astt> it's a dynamic form
[16:33:14] <t0astt> switch based on the value of a select input
[16:33:28] <t0astt> depending on the select input, different parameters get collected
[16:33:37] <Snerf> t0astt , ya, cant do much with that
[16:33:51] <t0astt> It's fine, I might know the problem
[16:35:18] <t0astt> Ok, so I found it. If I check the box, it .prop('checked') returns "true". Is there a way I can get it to return a 0 or 1?
[16:35:43] <Snerf> ya, I thought it was a true or false. just use an if statement then
[16:35:51] <t0astt> that's what I was just thinking
[16:35:53] <t0astt> I'll try that
[16:42:25] <t0astt> dafuq. I changed it to this: ( $('#short-answer-required').is(':checked') ) ? params[0] = 1 : params[0] = 0; and it ignores the 0 or 1 and just says true or false still. >_<
[16:44:28] <spookah> varchar: thanks
[16:47:24] <jeffreylevesque> I'm using jquery validation.  When the form fails validation, the corresponding HTML label is created in the dom with the corresponding error message.  However the form is still submitted via ajax to the 'action url' - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/geolocation-web/blob/master/static/js/ajax_data.js#L20
[16:48:00] <jeffreylevesque> could anyone assist me determining why the form validation isn't prevented on failed jquery form validation?
[16:51:35] <Ansikt> jeffreylevesque, I think all jQuery validation does is straight-up validation, yeah?  You'd need to .preventDefault() the form's submit event when validation fails
[16:51:51] <Ansikt> Never used that plugin, though
[16:52:43] <Ansikt> Actually, I'm totally wrong.  Unread what I just wrote.
[16:52:52] <jeffreylevesque> it's all good :)
[16:55:08] <reyley> t0astt: change it to
[16:55:35] <reyley> params[0] = ($('#short-answer-required').is(':checked') ) ? 1 : 0;
[16:57:01] <Ansikt> jeffreylevesque, If you have a webserver or a fiddle, I'd be more than happy to check out what you've written :)
[16:59:49] <jeffreylevesque> Ansikt: I'm going to try to move my 'submitHandler' up higher - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12162534/form-still-submits-when-validation-failed
[16:59:59] <jeffreylevesque> i don't have a public webserver
[17:00:07] <jeffreylevesque> if you want to clone my repo, that's cool
[17:02:21] <Ansikt> Sure.  Where's the repo and what's the file name?
[17:03:47] <jeffreylevesque> https://github.com/jeff1evesque/geolocation-web
[17:04:03] <jeffreylevesque> i should have this in a few moments i think
[17:07:26] <jeffreylevesque> Ansikt: got it, had to restructure my 'submitHandler' like - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12162534/form-still-submits-when-validation-failed#12162561
[17:10:20] <kevireilly> strayArch: crapcakes. You're sure there isn't any insight that you can gleam from inspectors? Someone in #css might have an idea and truth be told, validation is the first thing they'll ask about
[17:10:48] <strayArch> kevireilly: I checked the CSS validation as well
[17:11:43] <Ansikt> jeffreylevesque, Awesome, glad to hear it.  As a side note, you've got one of the cleanest jQuery-only JS projects I've seen in a while.  Granted, it's rather small, but still.  I dig it.
[17:12:55] <kevireilly> strayArch: I can't recall the exact nature of the issue, but sometimes I've gotten away with searching for the browser/issue pieces and someone else had noticed it and figured out a work around
[17:13:05] <jeffreylevesque> Ansikt: thank you sir.  Feel free to use the project, or change it, if you find it useful.  All it does, is supposedly finds earthquakes within a specified GPS coordinate.  But, the proof of concept can be altered to whatever.  HTML5 has the ability to grab your current GPS coordinates
[17:13:50] <strayArch> kevireilly: I tried, and found similar topics, but none were browser specific --- chrome centers the page on load and scrolls on menu collapse
[17:15:04] <Ansikt> strayArch, can I see what everybody else is asking about?  Looks like I joined the party a little late
[17:15:51] <kevireilly> strayArch: well, you were saying mobile chrome though right? I'm not sure what the specific reference might be, but chrome on the desktop is likely not a mirror of mobile chrome
[17:16:26] <strayArch> stronz.co/#portfolio
[17:18:15] <strayArch> kevireilly: technically both. It wont occur on desktop unless you change window pixalation width
[17:18:59] <kevireilly> strayArch: window pixelation width? Also, by desktop chrome I didn't mean the mobile emulators
[17:19:20] <Ansikt> What's wrong with that page you sent me?
[17:19:48] <kevireilly> I'd personally add some padding to the text area container
[17:20:31] <strayArch> Ansikt: The easiest way to reproduce is to open the page on a mobile device (i.e. phone). Then click on the menu button and then portfolio to load the page again.
[17:21:34] <strayArch> kevireilly:  Once, I get there ^_^
[17:22:07] <strayArch> Ansikt: chrome specific**
[17:25:31] <kevireilly> strayArch: which emulator device can you replicate it from in chrome?
[17:26:05] <baako> how do i make #code which is an input field not clickable. basically make it unable to enter any value
[17:26:05] <baako> http://kopy.io/Wm9Ho
[17:26:17] <strayArch> Another way to reproduce is to open chrome dev-tools and move dev-tools to the right hand side. If you expand idev-tools up to where you hit the pixel width break-point (approx. 739-749)
[17:26:25] <strayArch> kevireilly: samsung s4
[17:26:43] <strayArch> kevireilly: It doesn't have my phone --- moto x
[17:32:46] <kevireilly> strayArch: the issue is that the page scrolls to the improper place or what is the issue?
[17:34:34] <strayArch> kevireilly: Correct, I would prefer it to either load at the top (probably the easier fix). Eventually, I would like it to load a top if the hash changes
[17:35:29] <strayArch> kevireilly: A less noticeable, unwanted, behavior is that if you collapse and uncollapse it scrolls down the page
[17:35:42] <kevireilly> strayArch: worth noting that once you do click portfolio, any subsequent clicks on the menu also scroll the page. Are you sure this isn't a javascript logic flaw or something?
[17:35:45] <baako> how do i make #code which is an input field not clickable. basically make it unable to enter any value
[17:35:46] <baako> http://kopy.io/Wm9Ho
[17:35:56] <strayArch> baako: I nknw your answer :O
[17:36:04] <baako> i have tried  $("input[name='code']").prop('disabled', true);​ but it says its illegal
[17:36:14] <kevireilly> disabled="disabled"
[17:36:48] <strayArch> baako: https://bpaste.net/show/f5c807efb787 some extra things you may find useful
[17:37:24] <strayArch> baako: If someone wants to they can always "barrow" what they see. e.g. Save page as
[17:38:17] <strayArch> kevireilly: It might be, the point that loses me: would firefox and chrome interpret js differently?
[17:38:57] <kevireilly> strayArch: possible, yeah. That is one of the things that jQuery aids in.
[17:39:23] <baako> kevireilly:  $("input[name='code']").prop(disabled='disabled', true);​ still same error
[17:39:24] <kevireilly> I just find it strange that the behavior changes after the first appearance of the issue
[17:39:43] <kevireilly> baako:  $("input[name='code']").prop('disabled', 'disabled');​
[17:40:32] <kevireilly> its possible that anything other than a boolean for the second argument will work such as 'true' or maybe even '', i just know that the suggested approach works from previous experience
[17:42:05] <systemfault> .prop is for DOM properties
[17:42:37] <kevireilly> perhaps i used attr
[17:42:46] <systemfault> So: $("input[name='code']").prop('disabled', true); or $("input[name='code']").prop('disabled', false);​
[17:42:57] <systemfault> attr is for html attribute, it's useless most of the time.
[17:42:58] <GR33NM4CH1N3> I know this is a jQuery channel, but the CSS one is dead.
[17:43:03] <systemfault> SInce it deals with string
[17:43:13] <GR33NM4CH1N3> I have a CSS/SASS related question.  Which of these css media query techniques should I use?
[17:43:15] <GR33NM4CH1N3> http://laravel.io/bin/vB2WP
[17:43:32] <GR33NM4CH1N3> Two basic, different techniques, about 30 LOC
[17:43:37] <strayArch> kevireilly: if your the one who mentioned modinizer, bootstrap utilizes it
[17:44:02] <Ansikt> @strayArch - turn off display:none; You'll notice that the second block begins exactly where the page is scrolling to.  Without reading your JS, I'd say, DON'T EVER use IDs unless you need to use CSS :target
[17:44:14] <kevireilly> strayArch: yes indeedie. It is more for detecting like localStorage suppoer and stuff like that though (I think, haven't really used it directly)
[17:44:15] <Ansikt> Get rid of the tag with id="portfolio" and you're golden
[17:44:31] <kevireilly> Ansikt to the rescue
[17:44:44] <baako> kevireilly: maybe thats not what i want. i want to make it so that you cannot type or click on the input field
[17:45:06] <Ansikt> Also, in addition to "don't use id's", don't use !important.
[17:46:09] <Ansikt> If you ever find yourself wanting to use !important, think about revising your selector specificity. It's incredibly crappy that CSS's concept of uniqueness is inextricably tied to its concept of inheritance.
[17:46:18] <Ansikt> but, such is life
[17:48:37] <strayArch> Ansikt: Sighhh, thank you but ;_; I get to rewrite all my js b/c my lazy-ness used it to define my JS xD
[17:48:39] <kevireilly> baako: should be http://jsfiddle.net/x1v5qzzk/
[17:49:05] <kevireilly> preventing clicks/selections I'm not sure about though
[17:49:36] <Ansikt> strayArch - yes, but if you don't do it while your codebase is small, your problem will only get worse
[17:51:44] <strayArch> Ansikt: Isn't that the truth. What is the best way to go about it? Currently, I have it check a list of objects for the class active and remove the class if found and add class to the current target.
[17:56:44] <Tagor> I have 'form' as an object and want to get an input field inside that form by name. How can I do this?
[17:57:21] <systemfault> What kind of object? jQuery? DOM?
[17:58:02] <Tagor> systemfault: var form = $('#formID');
[17:58:15] <systemfault> So, it's a jQuery object
[17:58:16] <cjohnson> form.find(':input[name=foo]')
[17:58:23] <systemfault> Without the :
[17:58:33] <cjohnson> depends what you mean
[17:58:46] <cjohnson> if only <input then yeah no need for :input
[17:58:51] <systemfault> It's always without the colon
[17:59:19] <cjohnson> no, it depends. input[name=foo] won't find a <select> or <textarea>
[17:59:44] <cjohnson> so if you only want <input>s then input is fine, otherwise :input
[18:02:47] <Tagor> thanks cjohnson
[18:03:13] <baako> kevireilly: thank you
[18:03:42] <kevireilly> no worries
[18:04:44] <Ansikt> strayArch, I like this pattern -
[18:04:59] <Ansikt> Actually, instead of writing an inline way to do it, give me a sec, and I'll write you a fiddle.
[18:06:36] <strayArch> Ansikt: thanks. The problem also has to do with jquery animations I believe --- there is no ID for button.
[18:12:27] <Ansikt> @strayArch http://jsfiddle.net/nwjyp6yp/
[18:13:30] <Ansikt> Truth be told, I wouldn't write it like that though - I'd hold the raw HTML in memory and just swap out the content when the route changes.
[18:13:47] <Ansikt> That being said, you can also write this with ZERO javascript.  Let me show you what that looks like.
[18:21:03] <Ansikt> strayArch, http://jsfiddle.net/nwjyp6yp/1/
[18:21:41] <Ansikt> That one's just CSS and HTML.  No JS.  Notice that even though I use IDs to achieve the :target effect, I don't actually ever reference them from the CSS its self.
[18:21:42] <strayArch> Ansikt: does that not hold the HTML in ram
[18:22:47] <Ansikt> No, it does not do that.
[18:23:33] <Ansikt> And for a small app, there's really no reason to do that.  If you're familiar with JS MVC tools, then you can use that method.  But for a small page like this, learning a whole MVC framework for that purpose doesn't make sense.
[18:24:59] <strayArch> I think I may use the first method for the pages, and the second method for the different content.
[18:27:21] <strayArch> Ansikt: I do things for fun, not purpose ^_^
[18:47:33] <t0astt> reyley: nice. I'll do that. Thanks!
[20:03:05] <tab1293> I have a table that I have a click event register whenever a table row is clicked. is there anyway to not register this click event if a specific column in the row is clicked?
[20:08:35] <sammich> tab1293: are you using delegates or bindings the event directly to the row?
[20:08:51] <tab1293> im using .on('click')
[20:08:55] <tab1293> sammich,
[20:09:09] <tab1293> I think I have to use the not selector is some way
[20:09:15] <sammich> what is the element/selector the .on is working on
[20:09:23] <sammich> the table, the row, or higher?
[20:09:39] <tab1293> its working on a row
[20:09:59] <tab1293> and I don't want it to fire the function when a specific element inside a column is clicked
[20:10:07] <sammich> actually never mind that train of thought
[20:10:12] <sammich> in the handler you already have
[20:10:28] <sammich> run your check for determining the column to ignore
[20:10:39] <sammich> if (...check...) {
[20:10:49] <sammich> return if match the column
[20:10:50] <tab1293> I tried doing $(this).is('i') inside the handler but that doesnt work
[20:11:09] <tab1293> the element i dont want to register the event is a i tag
[20:11:17] <sammich> $(this) is the target of the click
[20:11:36] <tab1293> isn't that what I am looking for
[20:11:36] <sammich> lemme make up a fiddle for you
[20:11:58] <tab1293> I thought that would be the most child element that was clicked
[20:12:11] <sammich> don't you want it to target the td?
[20:12:39] <sammich> $('selector').on('click', 'td', function() { if ($(this).index() === 3) { return; } });
[20:12:39] <Ansikt> no, wait
[20:12:54] <Ansikt> isn't this equivalent to e.currentTarget, whereas you want e.target?
[20:13:08] <Ansikt> I mean, let me see dat fiddle, but I'm pretty sure that's your problem
[20:13:10] <sammich> the target could be an element inside the td
[20:13:37] <Ansikt> yep
[20:13:37] <tab1293> Ansikt, whats the difference between target and currenttarget?
[20:14:17] <Ansikt> target is the deepest element the event is bubbling from.  Current target is the one you bound to / what jQuery's 'this' is.
[20:14:17] <sammich> currenttarget is $('selector')
[20:14:38] <tab1293> okay then that solves my problem i think
[20:14:53] <tab1293> I just want to check if e.target is the element I don't want in the handler
[20:14:57] <tab1293> and just return if it is
[20:15:10] <sammich> is e.target is $(this), though
[20:15:32] <sammich> inside the handler
[20:15:42] <Ansikt> Or more like
[20:16:07] <sammich> just use the filter part of 'on'
[20:16:32] <Ansikt> if $(e.currentTarget).find('td').contains(e.target)
[20:16:37] <Ansikt> actually, that's terrible
[20:16:52] <sammich> just use my bit above...
[20:17:01] <Ansikt> sammich, But that won't work
[20:17:10] <andrew9183> whats the question here
[20:17:27] <sammich> unless, of course, the column to ignore is specific to an element inside a td
[20:17:35] <Ansikt> If it's <tr><td><button> and he clicks on the button, then your solution would say that it's NOT in the blacklisted TD when it is.  Filter works best.
[20:18:08] <Ansikt> Oh, sorry, I was responding to your first one.  Not sure how the second would work, actually.
[20:18:25] <sammich> I did mean my coded solution
[20:18:42] <Ansikt> Oh yeah.  That would fail.
[20:18:56] <sammich> I don't see how, but lets see something else
[20:19:16] <sammich> the button click bubbles to the td
[20:19:31] <sammich> the column is blacklisted, assuming the button is always in column 4
[20:19:36] <andrew9183> whats the problem here
[20:19:53] <Ansikt> The thing is - at this point we're doing complex dom manip to figure out if a event should be triggered or not.  That seems sloppy.  I feel we can think of a cleaner way to do this.
[20:20:05] <sammich> we're not really...
[20:20:17] <Ansikt> andrew9183, trigger an event when a user clicks on a table row, but not if the user clicks on a specific row
[20:20:24] <sammich> specific column
[20:20:27] <Ansikt> Yeah
[20:20:43] <sammich> the alternative is to cancel the event
[20:20:56] <Ansikt> sammich - I've been wrong before.  Write a fiddle if you disagree.
[20:20:56] <andrew9183> so how do you click a table row without clicking a column ?
[20:21:17] <Ansikt> andrew9183, on a specific one.  Like, trigger if on the first and third column, but not the second
[20:21:19] <sammich> child elements recieve the event first, and bubble up
[20:21:42] <Ansikt> Lemme write a fiddle of how I think this should be done
[20:22:02] <Ansikt> See if you can come up with something cleaner :P
[20:25:02] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/0f2mssLf/
[20:28:51] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/sjz5x404/
[20:28:55] <andrew9183> what is wrong with this
[20:29:25] <sammich> the ignoring a column part
[20:29:30] <andrew9183> ?
[20:29:37] <sammich> see my example
[20:29:39] <andrew9183> i don’t get this ignoring a column
[20:29:58] <sammich> it's been mentioned on this channel about three times now
[20:30:11] <Ansikt> http://jsfiddle.net/3x91Lrrn/
[20:31:12] <andrew9183> why not use pointer-events ?
[20:31:14] <andrew9183> its cleaner
[20:31:19] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/sjz5x404/2/
[20:31:42] <Ansikt> Nice.
[20:32:13] <Ansikt> A hell of a lot of ways to skin a cat.
[20:32:28] <sammich> that works as well
[20:32:43] <andrew9183> well i wouldn’t do the index method since its clunky
[20:32:48] <andrew9183> and columns can change positions
[20:33:11] <Ansikt> He could have as easily used a class
[20:33:29] <sammich> classes are more semantic, at least
[20:33:33] <Ansikt> the general concept stands
[20:34:22] <sammich> it's actually ironcic, since his pointer event was defined to :first-child ;D

[23:14:29] <Puck6633> Can anyone suggest a fix for this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/x3r7rpwn/
