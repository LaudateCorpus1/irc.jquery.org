[05:51:54] <robertparkerx> I am checking the length of li to see the count of how many elements. How can I use (this) so I can select the specific ones that meet the criteria?
[05:53:41] <robertparkerx> nevermind
[06:07:05] <robertparkerx> Can someone help me with this https://termbin.com/w4ib
[06:27:38] <pavonia> robertparkerx: What's the question exactly?
[06:27:58] <robertparkerx> I got this working except for the anchor
[06:27:59] <robertparkerx> https://termbin.com/4x7u3
[06:28:22] <robertparkerx> How can I select the anchor from <ul><li><a></a></li></ul>
[06:28:28] <robertparkerx> The rest is working now
[06:30:06] <pavonia> The selector seems to be correct
[06:30:39] <robertparkerx> It works with jQuery(this).children('li').children('a').css('height', '83px').css('display', 'table-cell').css('vertical-align', 'middle');
[06:32:04] <pavonia> Oh, you want .find(), not .children()
[06:32:29] <pavonia> "li a" will never match the immediate children of the ul
[06:33:20] <robertparkerx> Yep that was it
[06:33:42] <pavonia> Why do you set the CSS style from JS? It's better to make a new class, put the CSS into the style sheet and then just change the class from JS
[06:37:32] <robertparkerx> I'll switch it out
[06:41:18] <robertparkerx> ty for the help
[07:32:02] <Sal> hi can someone tell me how can I load a webpage into a var?
[07:32:35] <Sal> I have an url that in the browser returns some json data
[07:33:05] <Sal> when I call the same url using $.ajax or $.getJSON, i get CORRS error
[07:34:02] <Uhkis> tell the webpage owner to enable cors
[07:34:57] <Sal> but why can i see it using the web browser?
[07:35:15] <Sal> i also tried using php, and I'm able to get it
[07:35:27] <Sal> only in js no
[07:37:26] <pavonia> That's how the protection works, calling it directly is different from AJAX requests
[07:37:53] <Sal> so, aint there a way to do it in js?
[07:38:06] <Sal> or do i need to cann a php file that does the work?
[07:38:14] <Sal> cann=call
[07:38:18] <Uhkis> only the proper way or you could bypass it with things
[07:44:19] <Cork> Sal: the point of cors is to prevent cross domain data calls where the server isn't secured for doing that safely
[07:44:30] <Cork> Sal: that is why only the server can enable it
[07:45:06] <Cork> you can have a server proxy the call; there are projects for ajax proxies on github
[07:45:31] <Cork> the important part is that the domains cookie isn't accessible to third party domains, as that can leak sensitive data from them
[07:46:39] <Sal> ok, thanks
[11:48:41] <stoca5943854> Hellooooooooooo!!!

[15:31:06] <iTommix> Need some help with $.each : i put some div’s with .prepend(html) in my document. after $(document).ready i want to iterate about them. but i get this: TypeError: cannot use 'in' operator to search for "length" in - why?
[15:33:09] <iTommix> all the div’s have a class with 2 classnames. one of the name is „device“ so i use $.each(„.device“).each…
[15:37:35] <iTommix> got my mistake, i guess
[16:48:31] <Guddu> What is the best way to show json data in a tabular format (one column corresponding to json message which may reach upto 50000 bytes)
[16:50:56] <Guddu> Just raw json data but beautified.
[17:30:58] <Robdgreat> Guddu: just from the description, this seems like it might do what you want https://github.com/MatchingRadar/Mr.JsonTable
[17:31:33] <Guddu> Robdgreat, Actually its a bit different my requirement
[17:31:42] <Guddu> I want to show a table with 5 columns
[17:32:08] <Guddu> 2 of those 5 columns correspond to a json string that need to be shown (may be in a modal view but beautified)
[17:32:46] <robertmaxrees> Guddu it sounds like wha3t you want is relatively specific - might be worth just building it out by hand.
[17:33:20] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, Agree
[17:33:40] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, Robdgreat Should you suggest I user jqueryui or some other framework for this?
[17:34:06] <Robdgreat> Guddu: have you used Datatables?
[17:34:15] <robertmaxrees> if you're not already using jqui or some other ui framework, i would not do so just for this one piece.
[17:34:39] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, I have used Semantic UI earlier
[17:34:50] <robertmaxrees> does the site currently use any framework?
[17:34:56] <robertmaxrees> *UI framework, that is
[17:35:08] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, New site so I will start from zero
[17:35:14] <Guddu> Robdgreat, Datatables looks so neat.
[17:35:21] <Robdgreat> it seems like a UI framework isn't needed just to pull data into a table format
[17:35:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:35:29] <robertmaxrees> what i'm getting at.
[17:35:34] <Robdgreat> so for this component I'd expect it's irrelevant
[17:35:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^
[17:35:47] <robertmaxrees> don't use a full blown UI framework just to do this one thing.
[17:35:49] <taplar> K.I.S.S
[17:36:21] <Robdgreat> as many of your pings as I intercept, robertmaxrees, I may as well do something useful sometimes
[17:36:28] <Robdgreat> though maybe sometimes I'm doing you a service
[17:36:31] <Robdgreat> I'll send an invoice
[17:36:32] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[17:36:39] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:37:58] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, robertmaxrees So is it ok to use jqueryUI and DataTables plugin for this? Would you recommend taking this route?
[17:38:12] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i wouldn't.
[17:38:15] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[17:38:33] <taplar> depends on what all you need your table to do
[17:38:44] <robertmaxrees> ^ and if your site actually needs all that functionality.
[17:44:24] <robertmaxrees> well that was fun
[17:44:54] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, I would like to put 2 buttons as well on the columns that have a JSON value...One to copy the text and one to show the complete messsage in a modal.
[17:45:17] <robertmaxrees> still not enough needed to pull in a full framework imo
[17:46:11] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, You suggest we use raw html to acocmplish this?
[17:46:28] <robertmaxrees> maybe jquery, too, but yeah.
[17:46:36] <robertmaxrees> keep it simple :)
