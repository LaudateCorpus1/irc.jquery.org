[00:00:29] <surianup> I need to hide the form if I click second time on the botton
[00:00:30] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/ak6uvhmu/
[00:00:46] <surianup> please can you help me
[00:02:28] <Cork> surianup: http://jsfiddle.net/ak6uvhmu/1/
[00:03:59] <surianup> Cork you have added toggleClass ?
[00:04:11] <Cork> replaced addClass with toggle
[00:04:11] <surianup> great buddy
[00:04:14] <Cork> and the .not(this)
[00:04:59] <surianup> Cork what is the mean of this  buttons.not(this).removeClass('active');
[00:05:20] <Cork> buttons except "this"
[00:05:33] <Cork> meaning take buttons, filter out the elements matching this
[00:05:58] <Cork> so it removes active from all buttons except the current one
[00:06:33] <surianup> ok thanks friend
[00:06:33] <kokut> Hello, i have a plugin that has a couple of event listeners or something in one element i need to stay quiet, is there a way to prevent them from calling the plugin?
[00:07:25] <kokut> i tried event.stopPropagation(); but it didn't work, maybe i wasn't targetting the correct element tho
[00:39:13] <Atreyua> is there any way i can make this " $('.searchable li').hide(); " hide all searchable list items exept the one with the class of " sidebar-search "
[01:14:38] <lintguy> Hello, I'm using dropzone with multiple instances, i can fire uploads with processqueue and then there is an even from each instance when those are complete. How can i listen with jquery and do something after those events have fired?
[01:58:55] <lintguy> Hello, I'm using dropzone with multiple instances, i can fire uploads with processqueue and then there is an even from each instance when those are complete. How can i listen with jquery and do something after those events have fired?
[02:00:19] <Cork> lintguy: keep a count of how many events you expect
[02:00:30] <Cork> and when the last of them fire call a separate function
[02:00:50] <lintguy> Hm, using a callback?
[02:00:55] <lintguy> Not a bad idea
[02:01:22] <Cork> no not callback
[02:01:37] <lintguy> They are all callback events?
[02:02:01] <lintguy> Ie. run a function when success response form the file upload
[02:02:19] <lintguy> That function runs i++ and when it reaches the expected value, run another function.
[02:02:28] <lintguy> Or did you have a different idea?
[02:02:42] <lintguy> Cork
[02:03:14] <Cork> lintguy: callback is a function you send to another function
[02:03:27] <Cork> to let that function callback to execute an undefined set of code
[02:03:38] <lintguy> Ah, ok
[02:03:52] <Cork> what i talked about was just a normal local function you call when the events you expect has fired
[02:04:08] <lintguy> Yes
[02:04:40] <lintguy> Hm, but there will be times where i don't know the expected amount
[02:05:01] <Cork> you have to extract that info then
[02:05:02] <lintguy> I guess i can add a class for checking that from a different function
[02:05:23] <lintguy> yes, like, save it on a data attribute
[02:05:29] <lintguy> or just add a class
[02:05:35] <lintguy> i guess data attribute would be faster
[02:05:48] <Cork> O_o
[02:05:55] <lintguy> ;)
[02:05:57] <Cork> a class to know the number of files updated??
[02:06:08] <Cork> not sure how that would relate at all
[02:06:33] <lintguy> dropzone instances bind to fields, so when they change the already add classes to the elements when the events are triggered
[02:06:59] <lintguy> So i could just do $('.editForm .dz-max-files-reached').length
[02:07:09] <lintguy> and get the amount of elements that have a file dropped
[02:07:59] <Cork> if you meant something like .dz-file-updated i would understand
[02:08:09] <Cork> but the name of that class sounds weird
[02:08:13] <lintguy> sure, the results would be the same
[02:08:27] <Cork> *uploaded
[02:08:50] <lintguy> i just took one that was already there, i would need to add dz-file-updated to that event
[02:08:57] <lintguy> in this case addedfile
[02:09:00] <Cork> except dz-max-files-reached would indicate a state of that element
[02:09:03] <Cork> and that doesn't make sense
[02:10:09] <lintguy> well kind of, i can block the element with some css styling now that i know it have the max amount of files added
[02:11:56] <lintguy> Hm, but now i can't use image preview
[02:12:24] <lintguy> I'll just add a manual field specific upload button instead and avoid this complexity..
[02:12:33] <lintguy> thanks Cork as usual :)
[02:13:27] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/nrffLv0v/
[02:13:47] <arc_> i need to make a variable global or something that achieves the same effect
[02:14:10] <arc_> because i have multiple click functions and i retrieve some data inside one and i need it inside another one
[02:14:48] <arc_> clicking on one thing creates a popup, clicking on the popup changes something else
[02:15:04] <arc_> well, changes the original thing i was clicking on
[02:15:07] <Cork> arc_: do these elements have a separating parent?
[02:15:19] <arc_> yes
[02:15:31] <Cork> then add the content to that element with .data
[02:16:16] <arc_> sorry, maybe i misunderstood the question
[02:17:35] <arc_> could you show me what you mean in that fiddle
[02:19:00] <Cork> arc_: http://jsfiddle.net/nrffLv0v/1/
[02:19:43] <Cork> with two sections http://jsfiddle.net/nrffLv0v/2/
[02:20:14] <arc_> well, that works, but i do not understand it at all
[02:20:34] <Cork> the on handler delegates the event handler to article
[02:20:42] <Cork> meaning it has two event handlers
[02:20:52] <Cork> instead of one event handler for each .data and .button element in the page
[02:21:16] <Cork> when the .data click handler does is search for the parent "section" and add it's content as a content data on that element
[02:21:26] <Cork> the .button event handler finds its sibling .target
[02:21:40] <Cork> and sets it content to the content of the content data entry in the parent section element
[02:22:02] <arc_> hm, ok
[02:22:05] <Cork> arc_: another option could be to just set a class on the clicked .data element
[02:22:11] <Cork> then you don't need to duplicate the data
[02:22:15] <arc_> ah, true
[02:22:23] <arc_> that probably works better for this situation
[02:22:28] <arc_> thanks
[02:23:14] <Cork> arc_: http://jsfiddle.net/nrffLv0v/3/
[02:25:48] <arc_> all i did was in the function to display the popup, add $(this).addClass("tochange");
[02:26:10] <arc_> and then in the function to change the color, $(".tochange").css("background-color", $(this).css("background-color"));
[02:26:16] <arc_> $(".tochange").removeClass("tochange");
[02:29:10] <arc_> but it works now, so thanks for giving me the iea
[02:29:11] <arc_> idea*
[02:54:12] <abishek> is there a way to queue functions in javascript so that intensive calls can be added and executed one after the other?
[02:55:12] <arthurvr> I guess you’ll like queues: http://learn.jquery.com/effects/queue-and-dequeue-explained/
[02:55:41] <Cork> abishek: you would have to check webworkers
[02:55:54] <Cork> cause normal js is single threaded
[02:56:01] <Cork> so everything else would stop while the queue process
[02:56:03] <abishek> but about browsers which don't support
[02:56:35] <Cork> ie10+ supports it
[02:56:52] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers#Browser_compatibility
[02:57:28] <abishek> Cork, I also came across this http://tomswitzer.net/2011/02/super-simple-javascript-queue/
[02:57:53] <Cork> except that one is still blocking
[02:58:06] <Cork> so the page will still freeze while the queue is processed
[02:58:38] <Cork> there are only three ways you can do heavy tasks without freezing the page
[02:58:52] <Cork> 1. split it up in small sections and call them with a setTimeout
[02:59:03] <Cork> 2. split it up in small sections and trigger it through sendMessage
[02:59:08] <Cork> 3. webworkers
[02:59:40] <Cork> 1 and 2 has quite big effect on the speed the stask is performed
[03:03:13] <mooza> hi, i'm trying to get JSON data but i can't seem to ge the data from the right keys, can someone point me in the right direction? Here is an example https://jsfiddle.net/5pa7xx4e/
[03:04:10] <Cork> mooza: the data is in elements not directly in the data variable
[03:05:23] <mooza> Cork: i see, but how can i access to data in the elements object?
[03:05:29] <mooza> the data*
[03:05:46] <Cork> $.each(data.elements, function() { this.title })
[03:06:29] <abishek> Cork, got disconnected, thanks for the info, what I am actually trying to do is to queue my ajax calls
[03:06:43] <serge> hey
[03:06:53] <mooza> Cork: wow, i was really struggling with that :) seems like this does the trick!!!
[03:06:57] <Cork> abishek: ah, queue or just know when they have all executed?
[03:07:09] <mooza> awesome, thanks Cork
[03:07:10] <serge> how do I prevent .css() from adding `px` to a specfic css property?
[03:07:28] <arthurvr> serge: just use jQuery.cssNumber
[03:07:32] <Cork> serge: .css never adds px to anything
[03:07:51] <abishek> i have a page that does almost 40 to 50 requests and I don't want them to do parallel execution but as a queue execution
[03:07:52] <Cork> or at least it didn't used to >_>
[03:08:15] <Cork> abishek: there is a ajaxQueue extension
[03:08:15] <serge> uh it always used to isn't it?
[03:08:19] <Cork> *plugin
[03:08:40] <Cork> ?g jquery.ajaxQueue
[03:08:41] <b-ot> Cork: gnarf/jquery-ajaxQueue · GitHub → https://github.com/gnarf/jquery-ajaxQueue
[03:09:01] <Cork> serge: i've had to add it manually
[03:09:17] <Cork> compared to .height() for example
[03:09:24] <serge> api.jquery.com/css
[03:09:26] <Cork> though that said, i don't use .css much
[03:09:27] <serge> "When a number is passed as the value, jQuery will convert it to a string and add px to the end of that string. If the property requires units other than px, convert the value to a string and add the appropriate units before calling the method."
[03:10:16] <arthurvr> yup. I guess cssNumber is what you was searching for. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.cssNumber/.
[03:12:27] <serge> Cork: arthurvr: so does it add px or not? I'm now not sure anymore
[03:12:43] <Cork> serge: it does
[03:12:54] <Cork> trust arthurvr on that :)
[03:13:34] <serge> okay understood. css number tends to work fine.
[03:17:46] <arc_> now i need to get the classes of an element as plain text, not as an object :|
[03:18:14] <Cork> classes as an object?!?
[03:18:20] <arc_> i have the classes in an array but when i try to set something to it, it says [object Object] instead of the text
[03:18:43] <Cork> by class are you talking about elements matched by a selector?
[03:19:29] <arc_> well, yes. i needed to return an array of the classes so i found a plugin that does that
[03:19:40] <arc_> and now i have var swatchClasses = $(this).classes();
[03:19:47] <arc_> which returns an array
[03:19:51] <Cork> why not just do this.className?
[03:20:08] <Cork> not sure why the plugin is needed at all
[03:20:17] <arc_> does that exist? i can't find it in the documentation
[03:20:26] <Cork> ?mdn element.className
[03:20:26] <b-ot> Cork: Element.className - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className
[03:20:42] <arc_> oh so it's javascript
[03:20:48] <Cork> no it's dom
[03:21:01] <arc_> ok
[03:21:24] <arc_> well if i do it that way i have to parse the string
[03:21:34] <Cork> not really
[03:21:45] <arc_> why not
[03:21:51] <Cork> this.className.split(' ') === .classes() from the sound of it
[03:22:36] <arc_> idk, i'm not sure why it returned objects
[03:23:09] <Cork> cause you most likely treat the array as a string
[03:23:10] <arc_> but for example "red" was returned as "rgb:(255, 0, 0)"
[03:23:19] <Cork> js> print([1,2,3] + 4)
[03:23:19] <arc_> class name red
[03:23:22] <b-ot> Cork: 1,2,34
[03:23:28] <Cork> bah
[03:23:36] <Cork> js> print({} + '')
[03:23:44] <b-ot> Cork: [object Object]
[03:23:52] <arc_> o_O
[03:24:09] <Cork> {}.toString() ==  [object Object]
[03:24:22] <arc_> i see
[03:24:57] <Cork> also why do you need to classes in this manner?
[03:25:11] <Cork> why isn't toggleClass/addClass/removeClass enough?
[03:25:56] <arc_> it's how i'm identifying something
[03:26:17] <Cork> so why not just .hasClass or .is()?
[03:26:58] <Cork> if you actually store data in classes your abusing the property
[03:27:21] <arc_> ok, i need to pull the class of a button and associate it with a field with the same class, then pull the field's value
[03:27:45] <Cork> the first part should not be a class
[03:28:05] <arc_> then what
[03:28:18] <arc_> they have to be the same
[03:28:25] <Cork> it should be something like <button data-target="tt1"> <input class="tt1" value="1">
[03:28:41] <Cork> then you can do $('.' +$(this).data('target')).val()
[03:29:02] <arc_> hm, ok
[03:30:30] <arc_> i have never used data
[03:30:40] <arc_> i am just a hobbyist hacking around :p
[03:31:17] <Cork> well you could replace it with .attr('data-target') if you prefer
[03:31:31] <arc_> it's ok, i think i get what to do
[03:31:35] <Cork> though .data let you store a lot more types of values then you can with .attr
[03:37:02] <Kartagis> what does Illegal invocation mean here? http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/yp9euk4z/
[03:37:06] * Kartagis hides
[03:37:50] <Cork> "TypeError: 'stepUp' called on an object that does not implement interface HTMLInputElement."
[03:38:43] <Cork> interesting, so the error isn't even related >_>
[03:39:48] <Cork> ah
[03:40:05] <Cork> ?api serialize @ Kartagis
[03:40:05] <b-ot> Kartagis: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[03:40:54] <Cork> Kartagis: you're currently trying to encode dom elements as a param string
[03:41:02] <Cork> and... lets just say that won't go so well
[03:43:14] <Kartagis> I'm assuming I need to serialise data
[03:43:24] <Abishek_> Cork, but is it a good idea to queue the ajax requests?
[03:43:33] <Cork> Kartagis: simplest is to just $('form').serialize()
[03:43:41] <Cork> instead of each field separately
[03:44:04] <Cork> abishek: you could let them be a few at a time
[03:44:22] <Cork> cause ya if you limit them to one at a time it might take quite a bit of time
[03:44:36] <Kartagis> data:$('form').serialize iiuc, amirite?
[03:44:57] <Cork> data: $('form').serialize()
[03:44:58] <Kartagis> data:$('form').serialize() iiuc, amirite?
[03:45:23] <abishek> Cork, the ajax queue plugin that you recommended, don't see on the docs on how many items to pass at a time, do you have any recommendation?
[03:45:26] <Kartagis> Cork: how are these matched on the server side? by id?
[03:45:43] <Cork> Kartagis: like forms normally are, by name
[03:45:54] <Cork> its only matter in the page
[03:45:57] <Cork> *ids
[03:46:19] <Kartagis> so I *have to* create a form
[03:46:26] <Kartagis> okay, gotcha
[03:46:45] <Cork> Kartagis: you should always have a form around user inputs
[03:47:06] <arc_> ugh wtf it's still [object Object] QQ
[03:47:14] <Cork> <form><input name="username"><input name="password"></form> is normally ehough
[03:47:52] <arc_> console.log(var); just returns a string
[03:48:04] <arc_> but if i do $(".tochange").attr("alt", $(".labelfield." + textValue));
[03:48:17] <arc_> textValue is replaced by [object Object]
[03:48:31] <arc_> wait
[03:48:34] <arc_> nevermind i screwed up
[03:49:07] <arc_> ok i fixed it
[03:49:10] <arc_> and thank you again
[03:49:40] <arc_> now that i see what i did here, i think it might have worked the way i was doing it before -_-
[03:50:20] <abishek> am just having trouble with 50 requests happening at the same time and trying to limit it
[03:52:56] <Kartagis> wtf? I am getting unexpected token :
[03:52:59] <Cork> abishek: there are more complext plugins that have paralel support
[03:53:21] <Kartagis> on type:'POST'
[03:53:22] <Cork> Kartagis: you most likely missed the comma
[03:53:44] <Kartagis> oh, jsfiddle is caching it
[03:53:55] <Kartagis> and showing me the old thing
[03:53:56] <Cork> abishek: or you could implement it you're self, it shouldn't be too hard
[03:54:49] <Kartagis> Cork: not to start a flamewar here, but "yourself", not "you're self"
[04:15:32] <arc_> k, that's as far as i'm going tonight. here's the end result of what i was working on :p
[04:15:33] <arc_> http://porath.org/map/
[04:18:47] <arc_> doesn't seem to work in firefox for now
[04:21:46] <brad> Anyone know why second onclick isn't triggering here? https://jsfiddle.net/4cgfxgxv/1/
[04:22:54] <Cork> brad: cause you replace the element with the event handler
[04:22:57] <arc_> probably because the object did not exist when the script initialized
[04:23:15] <arc_> or that :p
[04:23:46] <Cork> brad: $() looks for elements matching the selector
[04:23:57] <Cork> .click then loops that sets and binds event handlers to each of them
[04:24:09] <brad> it only does that on page load?
[04:24:13] <Cork> so if you later replace or add mew elements they won't have an event handler
[04:24:16] <Cork> yes
[04:24:20] <arc_> oh so i was right, ok
[04:24:23] <Cork> the solution is to delegate the event handler
[04:24:27] <brad> if I hide that stuff rather than add it later, would that work?
[04:24:35] <brad> display: none
[04:24:39] <arc_> should, yes
[04:25:00] <brad> perfect...thank you both
[04:25:06] <Cork> brad: https://jsfiddle.net/4cgfxgxv/2/
[04:26:01] <brad> oh, that works too, thank you
[04:26:31] <Cork> brad: also you shouldn't use alert for debugging
[04:26:44] <Cork> console.log() is a more dependable solution
[04:27:35] <brad> alright
[04:38:24] <lintguy> Hm, this doesn't work? $('[data-imageid="something'"]')
[04:38:42] <lintguy> If i only do $('[data-imageid]') i get the selectors
[04:38:56] <lintguy> So i don't get why $('[data-imageid="something'"]') don't work.
[04:40:01] <Cork> lintguy: g'"]') <--
[04:40:06] <Cork> quote error
[04:40:25] <lintguy> $('[data-imageid="Image1"]')
[04:40:40] <lintguy> Is the exact thing i'm trying with
[04:40:45] <lintguy> but it doesn't find the selector.
[04:40:49] <Cork> ok, how are you adding the imageid?
[04:41:13] <lintguy> Hm, good point…
[04:41:17] <Cork> .data('imageid', 'Image1') ?
[04:41:31] <lintguy> using .html
[04:41:39] <Cork> then it should work
[04:42:31] <Cork> lintguy: though that said, sounds like it possibly shouldn't be a data- entry (possibly a class? or id?)
[04:45:21] <lintguy> dropzone requires a unique identifier, guess it's better to just add an id.
[04:45:34] <Cork> i think so ya
[04:45:41] <lintguy> I could add a second class though
[04:45:55] <lintguy> How do i get a second class from this?
[04:46:00] <Cork> if it should be page unique and id would be the better
[04:46:09] <Cork> + choice
[04:46:20] <lintguy> Hm, ok, i'll go with that then.
[04:46:20] <Cork> get a class??
[04:46:39] <lintguy> Yeah, from this, it's in an array right?
[04:46:58] <Cork> you mean how you use two classes in a selector?
[04:47:10] <Cork> the question doesn't make any sense...
[04:47:21] <lintguy> $(this).attr('class').indexOf('packageDown')
[04:47:28] <lintguy> Like htat
[04:47:35] <Cork> oh, please don't >_<'
[04:47:39] <lintguy> ;)
[04:47:42] <Cork> ?api hasClass
[04:47:42] <b-ot> Cork: .hasClass(): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[04:47:58] <lintguy> Didn't know that existed

[04:48:36] <lintguy> Thanks
[04:56:47] <davetarmac> got a check for this: $('#header-nav').is(':hover') but it doesn't work in IE11 - is there a reason?
[04:57:09] <davetarmac> I know there were issues with IE8 and .is(':hover')
[05:07:50] <decx> in what context do you use is(':hover')
[05:12:52] <davetarmac> decx: if (!$('#header-nav').is(':hover')) { ... }
[05:13:16] <davetarmac> decx: it's for a subnav dropdown, soI'm checking if going from one element to another
[05:21:48] <decx> seems weird
[05:22:32] <decx> usually whereever you have your hover or mouseenter event you also have e.target from which you can do that
[05:23:44] <kk_drop> I have something like this: $('#element').customFunction('value'); I'm calling it on each keyup and change  event. I would like to unbind this, but it does not work.
[05:23:56] <davetarmac> I don't really know much, so I gleaned that from numerous google searches and reading the api
[05:30:55] <arc_> somehow return isn't behaving how i expect it to. i was hoping to use it to end the handling of an event, but it doesn't seem to do that
[05:31:16] <Cork> arc_: end it?
[05:31:25] <Cork> mean like exit the handler function early?
[05:31:28] <arc_> yes
[05:31:35] <Cork> that should work just fine
[05:31:52] <arc_> it doesn't seem to be for some reason
[05:32:01] <Cork> make a fiddle
[05:32:28] <arc_> i will try but i'm not sure if i will be able to reproduce this
[05:32:57] <Cork> just copy the code you're working with right now
[05:33:00] <Cork> it doesn't have to be working
[05:38:33] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/Lq4bmv4h/
[05:38:48] <arc_> so if you click a square, then click again, the picker pops up
[05:39:04] <arc_> i want to be able to click on a dark square to make the picker go away without activating that square
[05:39:15] <arc_> return should break out of that handler, but it doesn't
[05:39:39] <arc_> it goes on to fire $(this).makeActive();
[05:40:21] <Cork> arc_: have you verified that the if cases actually work?
[05:40:45] <Cork> !$(".colorselector").css("display", "none") <-- this will always be false btw
[05:41:26] <arc_> why is that
[05:41:47] <Cork> cause .css(key, value) reaturns the jquery object
[05:41:53] <Cork> so as you set the display to none
[05:42:00] <arc_> oh : /
[05:42:04] <Cork> it will return a jquery objects and objects are truthy
[05:42:14] <Cork> js> print(!{})
[05:42:19] <b-ot> Cork: false
[05:42:33] <Cork> that is equal to what you're doing ^
[05:42:49] <arc_> so i'm not actually evaluating anything, i'm assigning
[05:42:54] <arc_> how do i evaluate that
[05:43:07] <Cork> arc_: i would recommend either use .show/.hide instead of .css
[05:43:13] <Cork> and use .is(':visible')
[05:43:23] <arc_> hm, ok
[05:43:30] <Cork> or (my preference) use a .visible class or similar
[05:43:41] <Cork> and use add/remove/toggleClass instead
[05:45:10] <arc_> hmm, weird
[05:46:13] <arc_> well, i guess that was definitely a case of "works, but i don't know why"
[05:49:43] <arc_> oh whoops, missed the colon
[05:50:17] <arc_> k, it works now. thanks again
[05:51:57] <norc> Hi. Is there some magic that allows me to append an URL encoded parameter to an URL string, regardless of whether it already has parameters or not?
[05:52:13] <Kartagis> weird, I've addes CORS header on my website but jsfiddle complains there isn't
[05:52:19] <Kartagis> added*
[05:53:38] <Cork> Kartagis: if it's post you have to respond to OPTIONS not POST/GET
[05:54:30] <Kartagis> Cork: it's $.ajax
[05:54:38] <Cork> type is?
[05:54:44] <Kartagis> oh
[05:54:48] <Kartagis> right
[05:54:52] <Cork> :)
[06:15:52] <jayjo> What the best way to format a date with jquery or even just plain javascript?
[06:16:20] <jayjo> now i have var today = new Date($.now());
[06:16:23] <jayjo> but I need to format that
[06:16:34] <jayjo> into MM/DD/YYYY
[06:22:15] <BillCriswell> jayjo: The $.now() is pretty useless in the call to new Date.
[06:25:59] <BillCriswell> jayjo: Are you going to be doing alot with dates? I'd normally suggest using moment causing working with dates in javascript is terrible.
[06:27:09] <arc_> https://github.com/phstc/jquery-dateFormat
[06:27:12] <arc_> this seems fairly straightforward
[06:28:28] <BillCriswell> http://momentjs.com/ is the library I use when I'm working with dates.
[06:28:44] <arc_> oic
[06:29:24] <arc_> yeah, that looks better
[06:29:39] <BillCriswell> jayjo: Though, if you JUST need to do that this question should help a lot: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23593052/format-javascript-date-to-yyyy-mm-dd
[06:35:39] <cordovafan8> Hello. I am reading up on the changes made to page events in jquery mobile 1.4. Specifically delegation and the pagecontainershow event. Has there been any update on the model since 1.4.3, or are these still not delegate-able per-page? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7283
[06:38:07] <bigmac> i am looking for a example using ajax and jquery... serving more content as you scroll down...
[06:38:46] <FoolsRun> Question: if an element has event.preventDefault()  on it already, can I detect a click on it? I feel like I'm going crazy.
[06:38:52] <bigmac> with php i plan to display the content threw a sql query
[06:38:57] <bigmac> select * from place
[06:39:23] <bigmac> i have 55 example rows i plan to display
[06:40:22] <PrasanthG> hello there
[06:40:23] <bigmac> each row from the sql query is wrapped in a div
[06:40:44] <PrasanthG> i had been into a situation of firing on click with jquery for once on an image http://pastebin.com/ZytUMcsQ
[06:41:26] <PrasanthG> can anyone suggest me why it is not firing click more than once
[06:42:34] <PrasanthG> here is the live demo http://jsfiddle.net/c4ny2twv/
[06:43:24] <PrasanthG> when we click on bucket it shows the popup overlay video and when we click close button, it hides video which was fine, but when i try to click bucket image again, it is not firing the click event
[06:43:44] <decx> i suggest you get familiar with the youtube iframe api
[06:44:04] <decx> who is gonna maintain that stringblob
[06:44:05] <decx> ^^
[06:45:33] <PrasanthG> :) Sure, but my issue is with multiple click event
[06:46:35] <monseiur_swifty> when using $.ajax(), should it turn all of my data object's values into strings?
[06:47:09] <monseiur_swifty> i.e. {"foo": true } becomes  {"foo": "true"}
[06:48:31] <PrasanthG> any help?
[06:49:00] <BillCriswell> monseiur_swifty: That seems a little weird. Are you sure it's not "true" in the json you're sending.
[06:49:02] <BillCriswell> ?
[06:50:20] <BillCriswell> PrasanthG: You're removing the video. I think you want to hide it.
[06:50:33] <monseiur_swifty> i console logged data before putting in $.ajax() and it had all the types in it... however when i look at the request, it seems to be all strings?!
[06:50:59] <PrasanthG> yes, i want to remove video and when i click on image again, it must append video
[06:51:13] <cordovafan8> well it has to be all strings
[06:51:20] <cordovafan8> in the request
[06:51:31] <cordovafan8> no bool in GET/POST vars
[06:52:03] <BillCriswell> PrasanthG: You're trying to do $('el').show() after $('el').remove(), there's nothing to show cause it's not there.
[06:52:37] <PrasanthG> oh. got some clarification
[06:52:57] <decx> so if you .show() in the woods and nobody is there, have you really shown?
[06:53:06] <monseiur_swifty> cordovafan8: i didn't realise that... i assumed that i could just pass a json object
[06:53:18] <BillCriswell> decx: I firmly believe I don't know.
[06:53:33] <decx> didnt know you were swiss
[06:53:44] <BillCriswell> Probably.
[06:53:49] <arc_> does jquery not support the javascript event oncontextmenu
[06:53:56] <monseiur_swifty> ah, penny just dropped.... if i put the json in the body of the request, i would be allowed to have it type strict right ?
[06:53:57] <decx> no strong feelings one way or the other huh
[06:54:21] <PrasanthG> well, bill, if i use hide(), the video is still playing in background and also, it is showing video overlays as many times as i click image.
[06:54:21] <decx> it's just contextmenu arc_
[06:54:28] <mooncup> monseiur_swifty: you just need to have the server parse the json at the other end
[06:54:37] <BillCriswell> monseiur_swifty: If you run a json_decode thingie on the string, sure.
[06:54:38] <cordovafan8> anyone familiar with pagecontainershow vs pageshow changes in jqm 1.4?
[06:54:54] <arc_> decx i can't find that in the documentation
[06:54:57] <cordovafan8> I would really like to be able to delegate per page
[06:55:04] <monseiur_swifty> ah, ok, thanks guys :-D
[06:56:22] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:01:04] <flashpoint9> Hey gang, Im looking for a simple way to get a vertical full screen slde effect like here (http://www.typeform.com/), even after googling im not finding many good/easy solutions. Anyone have any advice or know any good plugins to use?
[07:03:58] <iNeophyte> Hey guys, http://privatepaste.com/40cd7b6d72 how can I select the admin link and append a new URL under it?
[07:04:17] <iNeophyte> I tried $("#moderatorBar.pageWidth.pageContent").after() but that doesn't seem to work
[07:10:05] <Cork> iNeophyte: you've missed the spaces
[07:10:14] <iNeophyte> ?
[07:10:18] <iNeophyte> What do you mean?
[07:10:41] <Cork> #moderatorBar.pageWidth.pageContent means you want an element with the id #moderatorBar and the class pageWidth and pageContent
[07:10:58] <Cork> not something inside the id
[07:11:18] <cordovafan8> So testing a jquery ajax statement, and it seems to take an extra couple of seconds (not ms) to load the ajax data even when the data is being retrieved from the same server. Ajax queries that should take 1s are taking up to 5s. I'm now on the latest jqm and jquery (1.x stream). What might I be doing wrong?
[07:11:28] <Cork> what you want is $('#moderatorBar .pageContent .adminLink')
[07:12:13] <iNeophyte> Hm but it still doesn't want to add the custom URL there :x
[07:12:32] <Cork> you said you wanted to add a link?
[07:12:42] <Cork> that is where .after comes in
[07:14:32] <iNeophyte> Hm .after adds space in the HTML? :o
[07:17:30] <iNeophyte> cool it works ty Cork !
[07:19:39] <lilalinuxKL> Is there an elegant way of hiding a table column that respects the existence of a colspan in some row?
[07:19:57] <cordovafan8> what might I use as a jquery linter these days? jqlint seems too old>?
[07:20:09] <gnarf> lilalinuxKL - tables suck
[07:20:15] <lilalinuxKL> :-)
[07:20:26] <gnarf> lilalinuxKL: I never found a nice utility, just gotta map the table and do some math... or
[07:20:32] <gnarf> use classes
[07:20:39] <gnarf> and <col> tags
[07:20:40] <lilalinuxKL> classes won't help
[07:20:50] <lilalinuxKL> col tags?
[07:21:04] <lilalinuxKL> oh, you mean mimicing a table?
[07:21:15] <gnarf> `mdn col
[07:21:16] <b-ot> gnarf: <col> - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col
[07:22:14] <gnarf> classes help with selection
[07:22:48] <gnarf> lilalinuxKL: you might be better off classes first then trying to switch up to a css layout using display table properties
[07:22:51] <lilalinuxKL> it;s not a selection problem
[07:23:15] <lilalinuxKL> the colspan cell neither should be hidden nor stay as it is
[07:23:20] <lilalinuxKL> the span should shrink
[07:23:22] <gnarf> right
[07:23:32] <gnarf> but you can update the css rule for that cell
[07:23:35] <gnarf> to reduce its span
[07:24:24] <lilalinuxKL> can I set the span explicitly?
[07:24:58] <lilalinuxKL> got it
[07:25:38] <gnarf> like $(".cell.span2").attr('colspan', function(x) { return +x - 1; });
[07:26:22] <gnarf> lilalinuxKL: honestly - i'd suggest a different kind of ux if you have this condition :)
[07:27:09] <gnarf> lilalinuxKL: also maybe look at slickgrid: https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/blob/master/examples/example-colspan.html
[07:27:11] <lilalinuxKL> maybe when it's time to refactor, but not for the moment
[07:27:15] <lilalinuxKL> thank you
[07:27:29] <gnarf> https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki
[07:28:33] <lilalinuxKL> what license is that?
[07:28:45] <gnarf> MIT
[07:28:45] <gnarf> https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE.txt
[07:29:28] <lilalinuxKL> MIT would be ok
[07:29:55] <gnarf> lilalinuxKL: http://mleibman.github.io/SlickGrid/examples/example-colspan.html
[07:30:06] <gnarf> that doesn't have hiding
[07:30:15] <gnarf> but i bet it would be pretty easy with slickgrid's api
[07:46:40] <decx> jsfiddle down?
[07:46:46] <decx> where do i send my savings?
[07:50:48] <lilalinuxKL> yeah, here too
[07:58:24] <gtwy> decx: jsfiddle down :(
[07:58:30] <gtwy> who runs it
[08:00:15] <decx> i would check but jsfiddle is down
[08:04:35] <lilalinuxKL> Registrant Name: Piotr Zalewa
[08:04:47] <lilalinuxKL> Registrant Phone: +44.2081238352
[08:04:51] <lilalinuxKL> feel free :-)
[08:05:48] <decx> who knows if he still maintains, last jsfiddle releated entry on his blog was like 5 years ago
[08:08:34] <decx> there's a twitter and people are already busy tweeting there
[08:08:48] <decx> now we play the waiting game
[08:19:48] <cordovafan8> I am really stumped about why these ajax queries take so long.
[08:20:30] <decx> when in doubt, add more ram to server
[08:42:06] <NoiseEee> cordovafan8: find out where they are slow.   the db queries?
[08:48:25] <cordovafan8> NoiseEee: Unfortunately it's not the queries. I tested the queries themselves yesterday and ajax with vanilla jquery/jqm yesterday, and the delay is gone. I also tested the execution time on the server. There is something inside my app that is causing all ajax requests (including changepage etc) to take longer than normal
[08:49:21] <cordovafan8> If I look at the chrome network tab and check the timeline for the request, there is a very long 'wait ttfb' which is ~2.5s longer than it takes the script to execute purely on the server
[08:49:43] <NoiseEee> well weren;t you attempting all sorts of sync requests and stuff the other day?
[08:49:52] <NoiseEee> have you embraced deferreds/promises/async etc yet
[08:50:00] <robertmaxrees> they said they "can't"
[08:50:09] <cordovafan8> if I test from localhost this is exacerbated and it becomes ~6s instead of 2.5 for some reason, perhaps https related
[08:50:27] <cordovafan8> this is on an async request
[08:51:06] <cordovafan8> actually on both async and sync requests, even after I eliminated the sync requests with deferreds as robertmaxrees suggested, the problem remained :(
[08:51:44] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you hit those endpoints directory, outside of an ajax request?
[08:51:48] <robertmaxrees> do they take that long?
[08:52:00] <cordovafan8> I still can't use the deferred methods because it makes page event order somewhat useless, but the main problem I'm trying to solve is this extra ajax time anyway
[08:52:16] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: they take 2.5s less if I access directly
[08:52:29] <cordovafan8> silly window is not autoscrolling down
[08:52:53] <cordovafan8> (I'm in the freenode webchat client)
[08:53:39] <cordovafan8> right now I'm trying to setup browser-perf to see if I can get some more detailed analysis
[08:54:11] <Shadow> Hi, does anyone know how to move the Google logo at the Bottom center of Google Maps to the Bottom left corner.
[08:55:58] <NoiseEee> you can see if their API has something that allows that Shadow
[08:56:44] <Shadow> NoiseEee: I checked but can't find anything about moving the logo
[08:56:58] <robertmaxrees> Shadow you mean in their embedded widget?
[08:58:51] <Shadow> robertmaxrees: It's the one that when you put your mouse over it says 'Click to see this area on Google Maps'
[08:59:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i wouldn't spend much time trying to re-style their stuff.
[08:59:47] <Shadow> Its blocking markers on the map
[09:00:02] <robertmaxrees> maybe change the zoom level then?
[09:00:45] <robertmaxrees> messing with the branding of 3rd party widgets, especially google's widgets, is kind of asking for pain.
[09:01:27] <Shadow> Its fine until the marker cluster is clicked, then its over the individual markers
[09:01:27] <andin> hi
[09:02:20] <decx> jsfiddle is back
[09:02:24] <decx> happy days are here again
[09:02:26] <robertmaxrees> yaaaaaaaaaay
[09:02:39] <andin> When I load a jquery module in a separate file like jquery.colorbox.js, after that I load additional content via ajax to the site. Do I need to register the functions in this file in any way again to be able to use them in the additionally loaded part of the site?
[09:03:12] <robertmaxrees> anderskristo generally, yeah, you need to reinitialize the plugin on newly created content.
[09:03:27] <robertmaxrees> err, andin
[09:03:30] <decx> step up yo tab game son
[09:03:34] <robertmaxrees> sheeeeeit
[09:03:51] <decx> that's the appropriate answer
[09:04:06] <andin> robertmaxrees: How do I do that normally?
[09:04:21] <decx> you dont need to reload the js
[09:04:27] <decx> just colorbox your new element
[09:04:30] <robertmaxrees> andin check the documentation of the plugin to see what the API says.
[09:07:26] <andi> Is there a small example around so I know what I'm searching for?
[09:07:49] <andi> At the moment it's the needle in the haystack and I do not even know how the needle looks like.
[09:08:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  it'd be in the documentation for the plugin.
[09:08:56] <cordovafan8> are there better suggestions for performance analysis than browser-perf? I'm also looking at JSHint and ESLint
[09:09:03] <decx> it'll just say to .colorbox() new elements
[09:09:21] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 hinters and linters are code quality tools, not performance tools.
[09:09:43] <cordovafan8> true, but maybe they would find something relevant anyway?
[09:09:45] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 if the issue is your ttfb is super high, that's usually a server issue.  either that or something is blocking.
[09:09:50] <robertmaxrees> not really, cordovafan8
[09:10:02] <robertmaxrees> you don't prematurely optimize.
[09:11:03] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: but if I send the ajax query directly, to the same server, the ttfb is fine, so I think in this case it's a client issue?
[09:11:31] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 or your server is handling client requests differently based on headers?
[09:11:36] <robertmaxrees> could be all sorts of things.
[09:12:22] <cordovafan8> so I looked at the requests with vanilla $.ajax() and my app and they are identical as far as I can see (header and content wise)
[09:12:47] <robertmaxrees> just giving you ideas to consider.
[09:13:23] <cordovafan8> sorry, didn't mean to sound ungrateful
[09:13:36] <cordovafan8> BillCriswell was helping me with this yesterday and said much the same as you
[09:14:04] <cordovafan8> I will take another look at the server side to make 100% sure I'm not missing something
[09:14:21] <robertmaxrees> it just feels like you're in here a lot asking for help on things that we can't really help with, y'know?
[09:15:01] <cordovafan8> either that, or I don't understand the problem well enough to describe it correctly, yeah
[09:15:14] <robertmaxrees> but you've figured out the problem isn't jquery related, right?
[09:15:53] <robertmaxrees> what's your server-side stack?
[09:16:53] <cordovafan8> not necessarily. It might be a configuration issue, since I use a few $.mobile variables in my mobileinit bind
[09:17:03] <cordovafan8> server side stack is php
[09:17:08] <cordovafan8> mysql
[09:17:15] <robertmaxrees> what variables do you have set?
[09:19:18] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/DQbbdTRs
[09:19:34] <cordovafan8> with jq 1.9.1 and jqm 1.3.1
[09:19:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, none of those are going to impact ajax.
[09:19:54] <cordovafan8> in an apache cordova application
[09:20:08] <cordovafan8> yeah I didn't think so, but a man can dream
[09:20:17] <robertmaxrees> eeeh, yeah, not really related.
[09:20:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to start hitting up channels related to your server-side stack and cordove.
[09:20:28] <robertmaxrees> *cordova
[09:20:34] <robertmaxrees> see if they can help you better.
[09:20:40] <robertmaxrees> same with whatever server you're using.
[09:20:47] <cordovafan8> ec2
[09:21:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need to start hitting up channels about those.
[09:23:08] <cordovafan8> I also thought it might be related to ssl
[09:23:33] <cordovafan8> since I've broken my localhost testing ssl cert and ajax takes 5x as long there as on a real server even
[09:23:57] <robertmaxrees> sure - so it sounds like you've ruled out jquery/jquery mobile as the culprit ;)
[09:33:00] <cordovafan8> so it seems :(
[09:40:03] <ratasxy> Hi, I have a problem
[09:40:23] <ratasxy> I created a div with .append()
[09:40:59] <ratasxy> but i can't create a child int this div using append
[09:41:34] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[09:41:50] <arthurvr> ratasxy: Normally that should perfectly work. A reduced testcase on jsfiddle/jsbin would be nice :)
[09:46:43] <ratasxy> my apologies, its working
[09:49:20] * tasaif is looking for a junior web dev job
[09:49:44] <arthurvr> ratasxy: glad to hear that!
[09:52:49] * robertmaxrees is looking for some tacos.
[09:54:18] * BillCriswell is searching for himself
[09:54:21] <BillCriswell> whatever that means.
[10:00:30] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: lol
[10:06:59] <cordovafan8> BillCriswell: found you!
[10:13:59] <BillCriswell> Yoooo
[10:14:06] <arthurvr> yooo
[11:22:17] <mariuscc> any clue what this means ? [prevObject: n.fn.init[1], context: document, selector: "Wc", jquery: "2.1.4", constructor: function…]
[11:22:31] <robertmaxrees> looks like a console logged function call.
[11:22:32] <mariuscc> it's console.log( $('.Wc') )
[11:22:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:23:10] <mariuscc> well the element exists or not ?
[11:23:24] <robertmaxrees> do console.log($('.Wc').length); for that.
[11:23:30] <mariuscc> and why I don't get the div but the function call ?
[11:23:45] <mariuscc> second one returns 0
[11:23:49] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[11:24:03] <robertmaxrees> the selector isn't matching anything.
[11:24:32] <mariuscc> I see. thanks
[12:06:04] <engaged> Is there a way to see all id’s within an id? like <form id=“job”><input id=“one”><input id=“two”></form>  is there any way to reference $(“#job”) and get #one and #two ?
[12:13:13] <kegster> engaged, well, probably not the way you want it to happen heh
[12:13:26] <kegster> something like...
[12:13:52] <kegster> $("#job [id]").each() perhaps?
[12:14:13] <kegster> i don't think that'd be very efficient though, engaged
[12:16:06] <engaged> ok kegster, i’m using happy.js to validate form, is tehre a way instead of putting each input id to just cover them all with the same error message:   https://jsfiddle.net/53ex6odh/
[12:16:20] <engaged> like “This field is required"
[12:16:50] <kegster> $("#job [id]").each(function() { /*code*/ });
[12:16:54] <kegster> and then for the function.. something like
[12:17:00] <kegster> (replacing /*code*/
[12:17:29] <kegster> if($(this).val().length > 0) { /* do something here like show an error */ }
[12:17:48] <kegster> just looping through each element within the form that has an ID, and checking the value of it
[12:18:23] <kegster> but i'm sure you should probably build a more efficient solution like maybe assigning any input field a class like .is_required and check for any "#job .is_required" to be empty
[12:19:26] <kegster> i'm not familiar with isHappy() forms
[12:22:15] <engaged> kegster could i do like: ‘#firstName,#lastName’: { required:true, message: “Required”}
[12:22:35] <kegster> no idea how the isHappy form works
[12:22:36] <kegster> :\
[12:23:32] <engaged> me neither
[12:30:16] <kegster> can't you just process a form normally?
[12:30:18] <kegster> heh
[13:07:00] <flashpoint9> I'm trying to wrap two divs with classes in a div, however its doubling up the wrapper div, here's my code http://dpaste.com/08P2AFE can anyone take a look
[13:10:42] <flashpoint9> I'm trying to wrap two divs with classes in a div, however its doubling up the wrapper div, here's my code http://dpaste.com/08P2AFE can anyone take a look
[13:15:10] <arc_> flashpoint9 your code is finding both h2.pane-title and div.pane-content, and wrapping each
[13:15:28] <flashpoint9> arc_: how can i wrap both divs?
[13:15:38] <arc_> change find(".pane-title, .pane-content") to find(".pane-title > .pane-content")
[13:16:33] <arc_> i assume you need to search for both because .pane-title may appear elsewhere without .pane-content inside it
[13:16:41] <arc_> if not, just get rid of .pane-content
[13:18:19] <flashpoint9> arc_: actually the code works, I just had it twice in my code
[13:18:23] <flashpoint9> sorry about that
[13:19:02] <arc_> lol okay :D
[13:19:43] <flashpoint9> :)
[13:23:59] <jayjo> is there a way to access multiple variables with the jquery selector instead of writing the same code twice ?
[13:24:17] <jayjo> I want to apply a method to elements with ids 'id1' and 'id2'
[13:24:40] <jayjo> but if I do $('#id1 #id2') that will only select the intersection, right?
[13:24:45] <jayjo> when I actuallyt want AND
[13:25:16] <arc_> #id1, #id2
[13:27:27] <tasaif> $('#id1 irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#id2') looks for #id2 inside of #id1
[13:28:01] <NoiseEee> what arc_ said
[13:32:06] <lilalinuxKL> Is there something like a transaction in jquery? i.e. I would like to remove some classes from a set of cells and set that class for a subset of them. But I don't want the display to flicker, if the class is removed and added to a cell but to stay untouched
[13:44:30] <NoiseEee> lilalinuxKL: just do the 'adds' before the 'removes' ?
[13:44:47] <NoiseEee> lilalinuxKL: but no, there is no idea of a 'transaction' kind of thing
[13:44:58] <lilalinuxKL> that would flicker, if the element doesn't have the class before
[13:50:33] <lilalinuxKL> NoiseEee: I think I have to work .filter()
[13:51:35] <jayjo> arc, thanks, that solved it
[13:51:42] <asdf12z_> hey.. so if i do a trigger for a keypress, why doesn't key down or key up get triggered? what's the best way to simulate a real key press? to just fire 3 triggers? keyup,keydown,keypress ?
[13:56:05] <flexpaint> http://jsfiddle.net/nhLLgqjk/ why does less padding on .c make the text smaller? using textfill
[13:57:47] <flexpaint> vs 1em http://jsfiddle.net/nhLLgqjk/1/ makes no sense..
[14:09:14] <arc_> flexpaint idk i'm not a css expert but if you change em to px, it works as expected. more px = smaller text
[14:10:02] <arc_> actually, if you open the inspector in chrome and mouse over the div, you can see that the div is not actually the shape of that black box
[14:10:22] <arc_> so it's your html's fault
[14:10:31] <flexpaint> arc_, which div?
[14:10:41] <arc_> you have <div class="cd"> <span>text</span> </div> </div>
[14:11:21] <arc_> er class="c"
[14:11:38] <flexpaint> c and d are inside cd
[14:11:40] <flexpaint> it's right
[14:12:31] <arc_> oh i misread because of the tabbing. ok, so the span is taking up the space between the end of the text and the right side of the div
[14:12:39] <arc_> not the space where the text is
[14:12:46] <arc_> i don't know why that is
[14:13:04] <flexpaint> if you go from 1px to 2px to 3px it gets smaller, bigger, smaller
[14:13:06] <flexpaint> wonky plugin
[14:13:32] <arc_> lol
[14:13:56] <arc_> i guess that's one option
[14:14:14] <flexpaint> no i mean changing it
[14:14:18] <flexpaint> i figured it out. it doesn't like odd numbers
[14:14:21] <flexpaint> lmao
[14:14:27] <arc_> excellent
[14:23:04] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[14:40:47] <kokut> robertmaxrees: sup
[14:41:01] <robertmaxrees> yoyo
[14:43:14] <nixnerd> Does jQuery mobile require the use of their funky css file?
[14:43:25] <robertmaxrees> you could write your own.
[14:43:30] <robertmaxrees> or customize theirs.
[14:44:49] <nixnerd> robertmaxrees: What if I just don't include it?
[14:44:57] <nixnerd> Becuase I already have all my styling set.
[14:45:12] <robertmaxrees> then don't use it.
[14:45:18] <robertmaxrees> it's not required.  nothing bad will happen.
[14:45:27] <robertmaxrees> you just might not styling on certain things.
[14:47:34] <nixnerd> fair enough.
[14:47:37] <nixnerd> thanks robertmaxrees
[14:47:48] <robertmaxrees> that was quick haha
[15:18:55] <pauled> robertmaxrees: Hi, I need your help here http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/ccd08qmr/ want to the button with 'Pause' state only if there is autoplay. (ps: I disabled audio)
[15:19:07] <robertmaxrees> there are over 700 people in this channel.
[15:19:47] <pauled> robertmaxrees: ^^ I know, but I already asked here yesterday
[15:19:48] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question out generally.
[15:20:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll get more help if you clarify your question btw.
[15:20:36] <robertmaxrees> and pair it down.
[15:21:22] <pauled> yes sorry I missed the word "start" in 'want to start the button'
[15:21:37] <robertmaxrees> right, that's not really what you're asking though ;)
[15:21:59] <robertmaxrees> break the problem down into its parts.
[15:22:18] <pauled> I don't understand ^^
[15:22:33] <decx> you already have all you need in there
[15:22:52] <robertmaxrees> break the problem down - if you want to change the button based on some information on the element, think about the first step in that process.
[15:23:46] <pauled> look in the code commented, I already tried
[15:24:06] <Sal> aint these two the same thing? $(document).on('scroll', 'div#act', onScroll)  and   $('dic#act').scroll(onScroll)
[15:24:16] <Sal> dic=div
[15:24:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:24:35] <robertmaxrees> one is a delegated listener.
[15:24:37] <robertmaxrees> the other isn't.
[15:24:49] <Sal> it gets into the onScroll function only with the second one
[15:25:00] <Sal> yes, i know
[15:25:11] <Sal> i'm saying, but it should call the function on both
[15:25:12] <Sal> no?
[15:25:15] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:25:25] <Sal> but only the second is working
[15:25:33] <robertmaxrees> the scroll event might not bubble.
[15:25:38] <robertmaxrees> or something is preventing it from bubbling.
[15:26:04] <Sal> i got preventDefault inside inScroll()
[15:26:07] <Sal> is it that?
[15:26:13] <Sal> onScoll
[15:26:15] <robertmaxrees> that could be involved, yes,
[15:26:20] <robertmaxrees> though probably not.
[15:26:22] <Sal> let me try
[15:26:25] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't stop it from bubbling.
[15:27:34] <robertmaxrees> pauled try harder man :)
[15:27:43] <pauled> also I tried this: if ($("#blast").prop('autoplay') === "true") { $("#play").text(pause);}
[15:27:59] <pauled> seems more complex
[15:28:16] <decx> do it when you init your icon
[15:30:03] <decx> http://fiddle.jshell.net/ccd08qmr/4/
[15:30:14] <Sal> robertmaxrees, its not bubbling
[15:30:20] <Sal> and i think its also right
[15:30:29] <Sal> why should a scroll event bubble?
[15:30:31] <robertmaxrees> Sal yeah scroll events might not by default, but i could be wrong.
[15:30:37] <Sal> it would scroll eberything on page
[15:30:37] <robertmaxrees> msot events DO bubble.
[15:30:43] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:30:48] <robertmaxrees> not necessaril.
[15:31:12] <robertmaxrees> i have a fire to put out at work.
[15:31:14] <robertmaxrees> good luck folks.
[15:31:35] <pauled> decx: wowww thanks, I could never have found it alone. thank you :)
[15:32:00] <decx> do you understand the ternary?
[15:32:24] <pauled> ternary?
[15:32:34] <decx> var blah = condition ? 'yes' : 'no'
[15:32:41] <decx> or like here in an object
[15:33:31] <pauled> I am trying to understand, I know the sign '?' is used in bash when something fail
[15:33:49] <Sal> just found this: "IMPORTANT: You cannot use delegated event handling for scroll because it does not bubble"
[15:34:08] <decx> it's like if (condition) { 'yes' } else { 'no' }
[15:34:21] <pauled> yeah nice
[15:34:23] <decx> but you can use it more freely
[15:34:25] <pauled> how is possible
[15:34:32] <decx> like in objects or for vars
[15:34:39] <decx> which is cumbersome with if
[15:38:19] <pauled> decx: very interesting. With my few trying to modify some code I am learning many :) It an interesting issue. I was going to rewrite the entire condition code and make it redundant.
[16:56:24] <ZeuZ> hey all, I want to call a function like $('#id').MyFunction(true);
[16:56:49] <ZeuZ> is it correct to say it like: $.fn.MyFunction = function(options) {...};
[16:56:57] <ZeuZ> or do I need to use $.fn.extend?
[16:58:41] <kevireilly> ZeuZ: https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[17:04:38] <Jeroen> Is it possible to post with JQuery and then get a result from PHP back to use in JQuery again?
[18:15:26] <Jeroen> got it.
[19:08:34] <Jeroen> I've done an ajax post and get result with data:. On success I do get data back but this is an array. How can I check what this array is?
[19:08:43] <Jeroen> as I print it I do get: "Array"
[19:15:44] <pauled> there is a way to .hide() or .remove() every thing except a child element?
[19:17:49] <pauled> hmm I guess found it
[20:11:36] <VectorX> hi, is there a version of $(document).ready(function(){ sort of thing where it will fire before images are loaded, i only need all the html basically ?
[20:11:52] <robertmaxrees> that's what document ready is.
[20:11:57] <robertmaxrees> it fires as soon as the HTML is ready.
[20:12:52] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/ - this explains it pretty well in the first paragraph :)
[20:15:48] <VectorX> robertmaxrees yeah but with that i have to wait till all the images are loaded aswell
[20:15:55] <pauled> .unwrap(); doesn't seem to work with my fiddle
[20:15:55] <robertmaxrees> not with document ready
[20:16:03] <robertmaxrees> VectorX document ready doesn't wait.
[20:16:12] <robertmaxrees> only window load waits.
[20:16:25] <pauled> unwrap() is disabled in fiddle?
[20:16:33] <robertmaxrees> pauled nope.
[20:16:45] <VectorX> ok
[20:16:49] <robertmaxrees> it's a full version of jquery in there PaulCapestany
[20:16:51] <robertmaxrees> err, pauled
[20:16:56] <VectorX> yeah guess the first paragraph says that
[20:17:20] <pauled> robertmaxrees: but it work in iframe?
[20:17:32] <robertmaxrees> pauled not sure i understand what you mean.
[20:18:07] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I mean the iframe of fiddle, but optionaly with another iframe embeded
[20:18:19] <robertmaxrees> that entirely depends on CORS
[20:18:30] <pauled> what is cors?
[20:18:50] <robertmaxrees> cross origin resource sharing - rules that dictate things like accessing pages over ajax and iframes.
[20:19:50] <robertmaxrees> pauled you might not be able to access the contents of the iframe from outside of the domain it's hosted on.  check your console to see if you get errors about that.
[20:20:38] <pauled> I am trying to embed a chessboard from lichess to see if it work, but basicaly with a simple html example of <div>balhblah<span>target</span></div> doesn't work
[20:21:18] <pauled> robertmaxrees: the lichess site allow iframe
[20:21:34] <robertmaxrees> pauled but it might not allows you to edit the contents of the iframe.
[20:21:44] <robertmaxrees> also: you need to use .contents() to access the iframe itself.
[20:22:04] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jsfiddle.net/ryohd1m2/
[20:22:08] <robertmaxrees> unwrap works fine.
[20:23:37] <pauled> let me show you: http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/4kov2obv/
[20:24:11] <duch_kazatel> right.
[20:24:14] <duch_kazatel> that's working as intended.
[20:24:19] <duch_kazatel> the wrapping element was removed.
[20:24:38] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4kov2obv/1/ - see how there's no border?
[20:24:58] <duch_kazatel> unwrap removes the parent of the element, not any sibling content.
[20:25:55] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4kov2obv/2/
[20:25:59] <duch_kazatel> this is what you want pauled
[20:28:01] <pauled> ah right !!! :)
[20:28:05] <pauled> but ...
[20:28:17] <pauled> why unwrap doesn't work
[20:28:22] <duch_kazatel> it does.
[20:28:26] <pauled> ...like that
[20:28:30] <duch_kazatel> it did exactly what it says it does - it removed the parent element
[20:28:41] <duch_kazatel> again - http://jsfiddle.net/ryohd1m2/
[20:28:45] <pauled> but not the content
[20:28:47] <duch_kazatel> right.
[20:28:51] <duch_kazatel> the content is not the parent element.
[20:28:55] <duch_kazatel> it's... the content.
[20:31:03] <pauled> right :) then replacewith is what I seeking
[20:32:36] <VectorX> or you could do this aswell http://jsfiddle.net/4kov2obv/3/
[20:33:16] <duch_kazatel> VectorX that... doesn't work.
[20:33:21] <duch_kazatel> that's not what they're looking for.
[20:34:14] <VectorX> i thought thats what you went with .content() to get the iframe contents
[20:34:26] <duch_kazatel> ... he's not using an iframe in that fiddle.
[20:35:08] <VectorX> isnt that what hes trying to use the example for though
[20:35:12] <duch_kazatel> his question in that fiddle was how to remove the test div and all of its contents from arount the newtext span
[20:35:23] <VectorX> sure
[20:35:25] <duch_kazatel> he was asking about how to unwrap content inside of an ifram.
[20:35:26] <duch_kazatel> *iframe
[20:37:02] <duch_kazatel> two-step process.  $('iframe').contents().find('someSelector').unwrap() would normally work though.
[20:37:41] <pauled> please look in iframe http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/4kov2obv/4/
[20:37:49] <pauled> I am doing wrong?
[20:39:16] <phiz> yes
[20:39:26] <duch_kazatel> the code's not even running haha
[20:40:29] <pauled> why?
[20:41:10] <duch_kazatel> race condition.
[20:41:24] <duch_kazatel> what element are you trying to replace?
[20:41:45] <pauled> div#lichess
[20:41:55] <duch_kazatel> don't prepend the tagname on id selectors btw.
[20:42:58] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, CORS.
[20:43:08] <duch_kazatel> you can't access this content over an iframe it looks like.
[20:44:41] <pauled> but it's supposed allowed according to the api
[20:44:46] <duch_kazatel> what is?
[20:44:54] <duch_kazatel> because embedding is a-ok
[20:45:05] <duch_kazatel> but they can still refuse to allow you access to edit the contents of the iframe.
[20:45:23] <pauled> https://github.com/ornicar/lila

[20:46:08] <pauled> <script src="http://en.lichess.org/embed?w=1016&h=650"></script>
[20:46:14] <duch_kazatel> please stop.
[20:46:21] <duch_kazatel> reread what i said.
[20:46:21] <pauled> ok
[20:46:57] <pauled> ok never mind
[20:47:03] <duch_kazatel> see what i mean?
[20:47:29] <pauled> nope ^^ I don't see how it can forbid edit
[20:47:34] <duch_kazatel> CORS
[20:47:40] <duch_kazatel> it can restrict that.
[20:47:59] <pauled> there is no way to bypass
[20:48:02] <pauled> ?
[20:48:15] <duch_kazatel> in this case, no.
[20:48:32] <arc_> could you dump the contents into a div and edit that
[20:48:47] <pauled> the content is dynamique
[20:48:52] <arc_> (i just got here, i don't know if that would even solve your problem)
[20:48:57] <duch_kazatel> arc_ not in this case.
[20:49:04] <arc_> k
[20:49:10] <duch_kazatel> it's a full chess app.
[20:51:29] <VectorX> pauled beside trying to unwrap stuff, what exactly are you trying to do, whats your goal here?
[20:51:43] <duch_kazatel> they're trying to make this auto-join thing.
[20:52:00] <VectorX> so a bot basically
[20:52:09] <duch_kazatel> so when somebody leaves a game they try to rematch and then when they say no it automatically puts them back into the "open" queue or whatever.
[20:52:24] <duch_kazatel> that way they don't have to hit the 3 or 4 buttons it'd take to do that.
[20:52:33] <duch_kazatel> i'd put a feature request in with the app to do that.
[20:52:50] <pauled> the goal is to display only the chessboard of a player following in a decent size,
[20:53:11] <duch_kazatel> oh i thought you were building that whole bot thing.
[20:53:14] <VectorX> wow two completly dirrent goals
[20:53:25] <duch_kazatel> hahaha that's what they were talking about a few days ago.
[20:53:47] <VectorX> ok so i think duch_kazatel might know how to make the size bigger
[20:53:49] <pauled> the userscript is another thing,
[20:53:50] <VectorX> do it man
[20:54:02] <duch_kazatel> make what size bigger?
[20:54:12] <VectorX> yeah like a penis
[20:54:18] <duch_kazatel> ... uhh...
[20:54:19] <duch_kazatel> what?
[20:54:28] <VectorX> j/k
[20:54:46] <VectorX> he said he wanted to make it bigger
[20:54:55] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[20:54:56] <pauled> I mean not like the devlopers page provide, 'tiny chessboard" of lichessTV
[20:55:16] <duch_kazatel> they want to reduce the amount of stuff being shown around the board i'll bet.
[20:55:23] <VectorX> oh god now i got people staring at me wondering why i am LOL
[20:56:14] <pauled> http://en.lichess.org/developers
[20:56:21] <duch_kazatel> ...
[20:57:03] <pauled> look that pag you will understand it's limited for tiny chessboard, and only TV or iframe of the entire site
[20:57:05] <VectorX> there you go
[20:57:14] <duch_kazatel> far out?
[20:57:45] <VectorX> i dont know, by the looks of it you can draw you on board and play the game
[20:58:19] <duch_kazatel> wat
[20:58:30] <VectorX> then you look closer and probably see thats not the case
[20:58:41] <duch_kazatel> that's just livestreaming stuff.
[21:00:06] <pauled> yes, can be enough if I can have control of what I watch, and wich size of the chess board
[21:00:23] <pauled> on live site I can follow anyone
[21:00:40] <duch_kazatel> notice how there aren't any options to let you choose?
[21:00:50] <duch_kazatel> it's almost like they WANT you on their site ;)
[21:01:15] <pauled> right
[21:01:53] <duch_kazatel> ... so then use their site?
[21:03:52] <pauled> That what I am doing, but I think for a site that provide only the chessboard to see if it can be used to broadcast live game
[21:04:09] <duch_kazatel> then ask them to make that?
[21:04:11] <pauled> ... with live commentary
[21:05:42] <VectorX> these goals keep expanding
[21:06:55] <pauled> never mind. It was just an exercise to learn if it was possible to do that
[21:07:02] <VectorX> pauled if you get any ideas, http://leethax.net/facebook/avengersalliance/  this is a browser addon i used to use, it playes most of the game automatically, probably can look it its source etc for inspiration
[21:07:19] <duch_kazatel> VectorX he can't access the site through the iframe.
[21:07:53] <VectorX> yeah so this will be on the site itself
[21:08:08] <VectorX> but work as a bot from the client machine
[21:08:16] <duch_kazatel> yeah as a plugin they might be able to do some things.
[21:08:24] <oliverio> good morning
[21:08:25] <oliverio> ;)
[21:08:35] <VectorX> just throwing an idea out
[21:08:42] <duch_kazatel> aye that's fair.
[21:08:50] <VectorX> thanks
[21:09:12] <VectorX> i think the game is in a iframe in facebook aswell
[21:09:38] <VectorX> so there would be quite a bit that can be learnt
[21:10:11] <duch_kazatel> it's really not that hard if you're already on the page.
[21:11:52] <VectorX> that depends on what page you are on i guess
[21:19:06] <oliverio> bom dia, pessoal
[21:19:14] <oliverio> o canal é de jQuery ou jQuery UI?
[21:19:18] <oliverio> só uma dúvida mesmo..
[21:36:01] <pauled> good day/nigh everyone. Tomorrow I will ask some help for userscript that use localStorage setting that work only for one setting ^^ I need it work with many vars :p
[21:37:15] <pauled> thanks again duch_kazatel. the discussion was nice :)
[21:37:21] <pauled> bye
