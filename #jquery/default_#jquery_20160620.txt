[00:08:53] <ClipperQ> Hi, I need help upgrading to jQuery 3.0.0. Checkout this simple fiddle and instead of using 2.2.4 version use 3.0.0. All CSS styles are lost. https://jsfiddle.net/pzsmd3tx/
[02:17:19] <zhy> hi. I'm trying to use progressbar for the firstime and I'm seeing this error "TypeError: $(...).progressbar is not a function"
[02:17:55] <zhy> Can someone help?
[02:19:24] <SlizardWizard> Have you included the necessary jQueryUI script?
[02:19:56] <zhy> I have included these:
[02:19:58] <zhy> <link rel="stylesheet" href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css">     <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>     <script src="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[02:21:25] <Cork> zhy: 1.11.4 might be too old
[02:21:53] <zhy> I also tried with <script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js"></script>
[02:21:54] <Cork> ah, sorry it's the latest >_<
[02:22:25] <Cork> hmm
[02:22:33] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/jquery-ui.js does include the plugin
[02:22:37] <Cork> so...
[02:25:12] <Cork> zhy: https://jsfiddle.net/j61x5tww/
[02:25:23] <Cork> so it should work fine
[02:25:54] <Cork> zhy: that said, have you thought about using <progress> instead?
[02:26:08] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress
[02:29:22] <zhy> Thans Cork. I will take a look at <progress>
[02:29:55] <Cork> zhy: something that isn't completely obvious on that page, you can style <progress> quite a lot
[02:33:29] <zhy> Sure. I still can't get the jqueryui plug-in to work. Must be something with the conflicting jquery libs. But <progress> worked as expected.
[02:33:39] <zhy> Thanks for your help, Cork.
[02:33:44] <Cork> np
[05:05:00] <ls> help
[05:56:52] <arup_r> why this line of code throws error? https://jsfiddle.net/9x4nuja5/2/ Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: 'a[rel=' + hash + ']'
[05:59:08] <arup_r> nvm, ignore me
[06:00:16] <rabbi1> any article link to display json data in nested html ?
[07:33:20] <SimpleName> why use $this=$(this)
[07:40:24] <shoky> because `this` changes in nested function calls, and also just so you don't call $() many times
[08:24:49] <KnightsOfNi> Hi, I have a div with 2 divs inside. I need an event to happen when clicking on the main div, but not somewhere inside the 2 sub-divs
[08:24:52] <KnightsOfNi> possible?
[08:32:48] <slax0r> KnightsOfNi: $("parent selector").click(function() { /* do your stuff */ }).children().click().function(e) { return false; });
[08:32:52] <slax0r> of the top of my head
[08:33:23] <KnightsOfNi> what does return false; do in this context?
[08:33:32] <slax0r> nothing
[08:33:37] <slax0r> it can be return "whatever"
[08:33:45] <slax0r> it's just a separate click handler for all the children
[08:34:30] <slax0r> or this could work too maybe $("parent selector").on("click", function(e) { if (e.target !== this) { return;
[08:34:44] <slax0r> or this could work too maybe $("parent selector").on("click", function(e) { if (e.target !== this) { return; } /* do stuff */ });
[08:34:49] <slax0r> sorry for double line
[08:48:25] <Serg_Penguin> hi ! I need a multi-language edit field so end users can give multi-language names to entities they create in my website
[08:48:46] <Serg_Penguin> try to search - there are solutions to many other multi-language demands, but not mine
[09:13:29] <homm_berger> hey all, so I'm using owl carousel to make an image slider and nav, and i also want to use javascript to append the nav to a different section. I'm having a hard time either targeting the div right or getting it not to i guess.. conflict with itself. i'm not sure if the code generating the nav and the code trying to move it might be conflicting. he
[09:14:12] <homm_berger> re's a snippet if anyone could take a look and offer some advice. http://pastebin.com/raw/XndgxNwT
[09:14:12] <homm_berger> this is in wordpress so the scripts are enqued in wordpress's functions file
[09:15:43] <homm_berger> $('#fabric-metadata-container').appendTo('#swatches-clone'); works totally find and great FWIW
[09:15:43] <homm_berger> *fine and great
[09:33:06] <xec> homm_berger: the appendTo() moves elements in the DOM, so you probably want to do that before initializing the carousel
[09:33:59] <homm_berger> put the lines before the carousel xec? I tried that earlier but it didn't work :(
[09:34:13] <homm_berger> the first line works fine
[09:34:45] <homm_berger> i figured it should go after because the carousel needs to be generated for it to move but that is noob logic
[09:34:48] <xec> does the carousel generate the elements you're trying to relocate?
[09:34:54] <homm_berger> yep
[09:35:05] <xec> right, i see. why are you moving them?
[09:35:34] <homm_berger> they are generated in the carousel and i want the controls outside of the carousel in another location
[09:35:46] <xec> depending on how the carousel works internally, it might expect (that part of) the DOM to stay the same
[09:35:49] <homm_berger> just aesthetics mostly
[09:35:56] <xec> you can probably do that with css
[09:35:57] <homm_berger> ahhhhhh oh crap, i see.. hmm
[09:36:57] <xec> like, position: absolute; and some margins or top/left values will move stuff around the page
[09:37:14] <homm_berger> yeah, i guess that would probably be a much better solution
[09:37:40] <homm_berger> good call xec, thank you for the help. It is pretty goofed to be moving the thing the script is generating with the script
[09:37:59] <homm_berger> i even tried a separate script, nada
[09:38:00] <homm_berger> heh
[10:32:03] <Z3R0> Question, when using say modals… is it better to link action on form submit? or btn submit?
[10:33:38] <mmmveggies> buttons have submit events?
[10:33:51] <Z3R0> type=submit ?
[10:34:12] <mmmveggies> yeah but all that does is tell the form to submit
[10:34:27] <Z3R0> ok so best practice to action on the form itself ?
[10:35:03] <mmmveggies> pretty sure that's the only place you can define the action O_o but yeah
[10:35:43] <Z3R0> not when using ajax… I’ve done it off buttons before… but was just curious which way people suggested
[10:36:01] <Z3R0> if they chained off the button or the form submit action itself
[10:39:04] <Serg_Penguin> hi ! how can i catch programmatic value change ? .on('change') seems not firing ...
[10:40:32] <shoky> Serg_Penguin: you can't. just call a function or something after changing the value
[10:57:28] <krambiorix> hi, with the formdata object ,how can i add an object?   In PHP i see it as an array with key undefined : https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=jwwaingbpV
[11:21:01] <zzookk> Hello. I have json like:
[11:21:01] <zzookk> {"levels":[{"name": 1,"y": 7009 }, {"name": 2,"y": 589 }, {"name": 3,"y": 432 }]} || but i need to reorginize this data to this -
[11:21:01] <zzookk> {"levels":[{"name":"1stLEVEL","y": 7009 }, {"name": "2ndLEVEL","y": 589 }, {"name": 3thLEVEL,"y": 432 }]}
[11:21:11] <zzookk> Can smb explain how can i do this?
[11:21:59] <neo12> I seem to be getting an error on line: $(document).trigger('data', { val: $('#form')} );
[11:23:51] <neo12> 	I seem to be getting an error on line: $(document).trigger('data', { val: $form} ); (where $form = $('#form');)
[11:24:33] <mikesrike> neo12 What are you trying to do?
[11:25:11] <neo12> trying to pass a node as data via trigger
[11:25:34] <neo12> that statement should work right?
[11:25:43] <neo12> maybe its something?
[11:26:18] <mikesrike> neo12 I'm not jquery expert but I think after the comma should go function() like this: $(document).trigger('data', function() { //do something})
[11:27:04] <Yepp> i have this form that I can't just prevent from submitting. Here's the script http://www.hastebin.com/yodiroyequ.coffee
[11:31:59] <mikesrike> There's an error
[11:32:21] <Yepp> who?
[11:32:25] <mikesrike> You
[11:32:32] <mikesrike> $("#delete-popover form").attr('action','{{ url('admin/employees/') }}/'+employeeID);
[11:32:57] <Yepp> where's the error? I'm using laravel blade btw
[11:33:03] <Yepp> that's not the problem tho
[11:33:18] <Yepp> the problem is i cant stop the form if it's inside the popover
[11:34:18] <mikesrike> There's an error because you used singlequotes inside another singlequote, so js thinks that end of quote is where another quote starts, but it's wrong. Use this instead and see what happens: $("#delete-popover form").attr('action','{{ url("admin/employees/") }}/'+employeeID);
[11:36:26] <Yepp> still not working. Stuffs inside the double brackets is not read by the js that way. It will be parsed by php. It'll turn it into text or html so you will not see it that way. It'll be a url
[11:36:59] <mikesrike> Can I see the view?
[11:37:35] <Yepp> i'll make a paste
[11:37:45] <Yepp> the parsed one btw? or the current one in laravel blade?
[11:38:08] <mikesrike> The one where the form is
[11:38:17] <Uhkis> you need to show us the markup/code that's read by the browser
[11:38:54] <Yepp> http://www.hastebin.com/ofafokutun.xml
[11:39:11] <Yepp> if i remove the class hidden on the popover content div, the preventDefault would work
[11:39:36] <Yepp> but if the popover content is being read by the popover inside the modal it does not
[11:39:45] <Uhkis> there you go, you dont have any submit handler on a form that's preventing the submit
[11:40:31] <mikesrike> Yepp The only form I see is on line 38 and it has no id or class
[11:40:50] <Yepp> what? I tried the .submit() too but it did not work either. I'll make a paste
[11:41:16] <mikesrike> Instead of this in line 38: <form method="POST" action="#" accept-charset="UTF-8"><input name="_method" type="hidden" value="DELETE"><input name="_token" type="hidden" value="CUYFHZ5CNY2ERSwCL782aBHpJ4gUhCceNtpjQCR3">
[11:41:18] <Yepp> im trying to prevent on that paste the action of the submit button
[11:41:37] <mikesrike> Use this: <form id="delete-popover" method="POST" action="#" accept-charset="UTF-8"><input name="_method" type="hidden" value="DELETE"><input name="_token" type="hidden" value="CUYFHZ5CNY2ERSwCL782aBHpJ4gUhCceNtpjQCR3">
[11:43:53] <Yepp> http://www.hastebin.com/gapopejove.xml
[11:46:00] <Yepp> tested it by removing the hidden class and submitting form outside the modal or modal->popover, it works
[11:46:47] <mikesrike> Now try to change doublequotes to singlequotes in line 73 and you'll see what I meant before
[11:47:56] <Yepp> forgot to paste the parsed one. that's the unparsed/raw php. i'll make a paste again
[11:50:14] <Yepp> http://www.hastebin.com/iyiyoqehon.xml
[11:58:12] <Yepp> ?
[12:02:23] <Yepp> hmm, does the content of the popover on the script section duplicates the div content? cause if yes, I guess i'll be having 2 divs with the same id
[13:04:24] <shtrb> What is the correct way to pass a dynamicly created element in a handler ? ( https://jsfiddle.net/9uoh7Lqm/ )
[13:05:43] <hassoon> ##psychology
[13:05:47] <hassoon> yay
[13:05:49] <hassoon> fail
[13:05:56] <shtrb> ?
[13:06:08] <NoiseEee> shtrb: $('#container').on('someAction','.classGivenToNewDiv', function() {}  )
[13:06:33] <NoiseEee> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ @ shtrb
[13:06:41] <shtrb> but my problem isn't with the delegation but with the value
[13:07:05] <shtrb> but I will visit the link just in case
[13:07:07] <NoiseEee> not really
[13:08:41] <shtrb> just verified
[13:08:51] <NoiseEee> verified what?
[13:09:18] <shtrb> it works (the delgation if the previous event existed)
[13:09:22] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/9uoh7Lqm/1/ (i forgot the delegation though...)
[13:09:23] <NoiseEee> oh
[13:10:06] <shtrb> moment I think it's an issue between keyboard and chair
[14:15:41] <ircbaako> hi guys i am callign a function is makes a ajax request and get data back has an object. i then try to pass that object to another function but it doesnt seem to work
[14:15:44] <ircbaako> says undefined
[14:15:56] <ircbaako> question is how do i pass an object on?
[14:25:59] <ircbaako> http://kopy.io/cXl4U
[14:31:31] <shoky> ircbaako: you can't return things from an ajax callback, it's async. you need to do whatever you wanna do in the callback(s)
[14:31:51] <NoiseEee1> ircbaako: this is a fundamental component of javascript called 'asynchronous programming'.  you use callbacks/promises etc that should fire when the request completes, more like http://kopy.io/jMKGK
[14:33:03] <NoiseEee1> and even that abstracts away too much, you should learn how to use $.ajax to see whats going on
[14:33:24] <shtrb> ircbaako, add a handler like success: function(result)
[14:41:30] <ircbaako> NoiseEee1, thanks
[14:52:50] <homm_berger> hey folks, does anyone have any resources about specificity? I'm trying to target all the way down in this structure and confused as to where to begin http://pastebin.com/GYWWYdUx
[14:55:39] <Z3R0> homm_berger: what are you trying to target specifically ?
[14:58:17] <homm_berger> well, it's not there currently but there's a div in there that's being cloned, and it's right below the image in the middle, this is the js for it $('#fabric-metadata-container').appendTo('#swatches-clone');
[14:58:37] <homm_berger> so somewhere in there, so far i have $('div[class="owl-item center"]).find('input[type="radio"]');.find['#fabric-swatch] z3r0
[14:59:43] <homm_berger> #fabric-metadata-container is in #fabric-swatch i believe (i wrote the dang html but i'll have to double check!)
[14:59:51] <Z3R0> why dod you need to go down that far ?
[14:59:52] <sillyslux> homm_berger, ids are unique
[14:59:59] <Z3R0> why not start at the unique id ?
[15:00:10] <sillyslux> so start with $('#fabric-swatch)
[15:00:30] <homm_berger> it needs to belong to the selected object, the "owl-item center"
[15:00:46] <sillyslux> it does
[15:00:57] <Z3R0> actually sillyslux it might not
[15:00:57] <homm_berger> ?? it does i think, doesn't it?!?! :P
[15:01:02] <sillyslux> there is only one div#fabric-swatch in html
[15:01:02] <homm_berger> i think it does
[15:01:06] <Z3R0> assuming he didn’t reuse id's
[15:01:15] <Z3R0> and has multiple owl-item’s with #fabric-swatch
[15:01:19] <homm_berger> they're generated with PHP, it's shortcode so they're all the same
[15:01:30] <sillyslux> then he should rewrite that part first
[15:01:53] <Z3R0> you should always only have 1 instance of a #id on anything, it’s not a re-usable …
[15:02:17] <Z3R0> if it is used more than once anywhere, make it a .clas
[15:02:24] <homm_berger> aha. i figured they were specific enough because they were all in different containers
[15:02:35] <homm_berger> should i not do that? i can not do that but i figured i'd have trouble targetting it
[15:02:41] <Z3R0> nope, because soon as you try and find #fabric-swatch
[15:02:48] <Z3R0> the first and only the first one will EVER be selected
[15:03:11] <homm_berger> can i do div[class="owl-item center"] to the same effect? just rename the divs <div class="fabric-swatch">?
[15:03:36] <sillyslux> the latter is good
[15:03:36] <homm_berger> whew! thanks guys for fixing my course here! sounds like this would have utterly failed
[15:03:41] <Z3R0> again, I would just rename #fabric-swatch to .fabric-swatch
[15:03:44] <Z3R0> and go off there
[15:04:11] <Z3R0> $(‘.fabric-swatch’).find(‘.swatches_clone’)… etc
[15:04:15] <homm_berger> awesome, will do. thank you z3r0, thank you sillyslux. besides that do you think this this seems like a good approach?
[15:04:27] <homm_berger> alrighty, awesome^, so on track besides the naming you think?
[15:04:30] <Z3R0> again it depends on what you are trying to do with those things
[15:04:40] <sillyslux> well you need to get to your elements somehow
[15:04:50] <homm_berger> each image has metadata that i want to pick out of it and append somewhere else
[15:05:17] <sillyslux> is that like.. exif data?
[15:05:18] <homm_berger> so i want to target the selected radio button's image and pick that image's metadata specifically
[15:05:50] <homm_berger> it's an owl carousel that has radio buttons in it so people can slide it and make selections, it's not just exif data but like fabric material, fabric strength, etc.
[15:05:56] <homm_berger> special metadata that another user enters
[15:06:00] <homm_berger> stored in PHP
[15:06:26] <sillyslux> ah
[15:06:28] <homm_berger> kinda like exif data i guess but it's its own thing i think, i'm a noob to the stuff but it's working so far (fingers crossed!)
[15:06:56] <homm_berger> you guys think this sounds like a legit plan all in all?
[15:07:58] <homm_berger> kinda wingin it, you already got me on a way more sensible course! :P
[15:09:07] <homm_berger> who am i kidding THIS IS SCIENCE IT HAS TO WORK!!
[15:09:29] <Z3R0> maybe?
[15:09:36] <Z3R0> Hard to tell for me, as I am more of a visual
[15:09:38] <homm_berger> :D
[15:11:46] <sillyslux> $('.fabric-swatch img') gives you the first match, if there are more, $$('.fabric-swatch img') returns an array of all matches
[15:12:03] <sillyslux> or $('.fabric-swatch input'
[15:12:35] <Karie91> Hi everyone
[15:13:33] <Karie91> Looking for some help for a Jquery/Ajax script i'm trying to fix
[15:13:54] <Karie91> If someone is willing to help me, send me a private message please...
[15:14:10] <sillyslux> does it have to be private?
[15:14:51] <Karie91> Not really, i don't want to take all the space here in the chat
[15:15:07] <Karie91> You helped me last time sillyslux, thanks again for that
[15:15:14] <sillyslux> oh did i?
[15:15:26] <sillyslux> was that the ajax news thingy?
[15:15:32] <sillyslux> ticker
[15:15:52] <Karie91> but i'm still on the same project.. trying to have my jquery/ajax/php script auto update when new item are added to the DB
[15:16:04] <Karie91> Yes ;)
[15:16:42] <sillyslux> you're still working on that very same thing?
[15:16:52] <sillyslux> and need help again?
[15:17:40] <Karie91> yes... i tried a lot of different things and nothing seems to do what i wanted
[15:17:47] <sillyslux> ok..
[15:18:07] <Karie91> i'm sticking with the original script, it should do the job but for some reason it dosnt auto-update when new things are added
[15:18:10] <sillyslux> well that involves an "active" part in your backend
[15:19:24] <sillyslux> as i said back then, you have either your clients pull from server every x seconds
[15:19:51] <sillyslux> or server sends himself, but that requires a websocket connection
[15:20:16] <sillyslux> which in turn requires ratchet(php) or socket.io(node)
[15:20:26] <Karie91> i tried with setInterval and setTimeout but its only doing it 1 time, and even if it did update every 5 second, i want to find a way that my script will no go back at the begning every X second, i just want it to add the last thing that was added in the db without having to replace everything
[15:20:52] <sillyslux> the latter are kind of webservers which would be permanently running processes
[15:21:44] <sillyslux> setInterval should do it permanently, but is considered bad
[15:21:59] <sillyslux> you can have setinterval running in a loop
[15:22:19] <sillyslux> as for adding new items to the plugin itself...
[15:22:21] <Karie91> i still need to customize the code to be able to COMPARE what is in the DB and what we have right now
[15:22:29] <sillyslux> can you paste the link again?
[15:23:46] <sillyslux> found it in history :)
[15:25:01] <Karie91> Haha there you go
[15:25:08] <sillyslux> yes :)
[15:25:47] <Karie91> If anyone has any example of a script that would od what i want, i could use that too
[15:27:28] <Azrael_-> hi
[15:28:04] <Azrael_-> i want to manually sort the rows of a table. after i sorted them, how do i make the new order visible best? removing all rows from the table or what is the best way?
[15:28:53] <Karie91> you look at test.php page, you will see that setInterval works well but if for example i was at the 4th news and it auto refresh, it will go back to the first one
[15:28:53] <Uhkis> usually there's some arrow on the sorted column
[15:29:43] <Azrael_-> Uhkis: i use it by giving numbers and after the user set the numbers, then he clicks "sort" and then i have to move the rows to the correct order
[15:30:38] <Uhkis> Azrael_-: mind showing?
[15:30:58] <Azrael_-> don't have a simple example at hand
[15:31:21] <Azrael_-> just found out that the "after"-function will remove the row from the original position and move it to the new one
[15:31:26] <Azrael_-> should work like expected
[15:32:18] <Uhkis> oh your question was about the dom manipulation, not ux :D
[15:32:40] <Azrael_-> ux?
[15:33:00] <Uhkis> user experience
[15:33:17] <sillyslux> brb
[15:33:56] <Azrael_-> correct
[15:37:25] <sillyslux> ok so test.php is easy, now the hard part may be telling jQuery-News-Ticker to add/reload items...
[15:38:06] <Karie91> Yes, thats the hard part :\
[15:38:38] <Karie91> i'm trying different option, may have to write a ticker script fromt he begining, but i dont have the skills to do that YET
[15:40:07] <homm_berger> so z3r0 , sillyslux , not seeming to have luck, do you think you guys could take a look at this structure and then the bottom line which is the targetting in JS? http://pastebin.com/raw/gF7ce0sJ
[15:40:52] <homm_berger> i'm trying to move the chunk <div class="fabric-metadata-container fabric-metadata-container-class">
[15:43:13] <shoky> homm_berger: you have a dot in your selector that shouldn't be there.. but really you shouldn't use [..] attribute selectors for classes,  use class selectors e.g. $('.fabric-metadata-container-class')
[15:45:10] <Z3R0> ya the middle find has that . in the class= which won’t work
[15:45:12] <Z3R0> it’s either or
[15:45:31] <homm_berger> thanks shoky! removing the dot didn't make it work, heh, but thank you. for the first line 'div[class="owl-item center"]' but it needs to have that center class. how would i write it like you suggeswt with two classes?
[15:45:49] <homm_berger> just .owl.center?
[15:45:49] <shoky> homm_berger:  .owl-item.center
[15:46:00] <homm_berger> awesome!!! :D thank you will give this a shot
[15:46:31] <homm_berger> wait shoky, this is being used with appendTo though, don't i need to target classes or no?
[15:46:41] <homm_berger> i mean target divs, not classes
[15:46:57] <shoky> hm?  appendTo will work on whatever you've selected
[15:46:58] <Z3R0> the classes reference the div container
[15:47:15] <Z3R0> var x = $(‘.class’) = <div class=“class”> x = <div>
[15:47:33] <homm_berger> but if i write it as .owl.class won't that not enable me to do div[.owl.class] ?
[15:47:45] <shoky> enable you to do what?
[15:47:47] <homm_berger> aha, ty shoky
[15:47:58] <homm_berger> target the divs which i suppose i don't need to do?
[15:48:20] <shoky> no idea what you mean
[15:48:32] <Z3R0> you’re targetting the element that the class is attached to
[15:49:15] <Z3R0> for instance if I have <div class=x”></div> and I do $(‘.x’).append(‘<div>test</div>’); … then I have <div class=“x”><div>test</div></div>
[15:49:22] <sillyslux> Karie91, well there's no option in jQuery-News-Ticker to add items
[15:49:42] <Z3R0> or that might be html() append might go afterwards, but either or you get the gist
[15:50:02] <homm_berger> ok, so I have $('.owl-item.center').find('.fabric-metadata-container').appendTo('#swatches-clone'); and it seems to not be working, it hasn't snatched up the element
[15:50:18] <homm_berger> still right where it was originally :(
[15:50:22] <shoky> make a jsfiddle/testcase
[15:50:31] <homm_berger> good idea
[15:50:51] <Karie91> Yes, i'm trying to figure out how i can do this
[15:51:51] <Z3R0> does #swatches-clone exist?
[15:52:10] <shoky> jsfiddle will show ;p
[15:52:24] <Z3R0> I think you have your thing backwards...
[15:53:43] <Z3R0> append will put the targetted element into the container, appendTo will put the preceding target into the targetted element...
[15:55:19] <homm_berger> i want to put what's on the left on the right z3r0
[15:55:32] <Z3R0> ok
[15:55:49] <homm_berger> it was working previously with just targetting the one section as a div specifically, making a jsfiddle now!! thanks for the help folks and pardon the noobishness
[15:56:44] <sqram> does it make sense storing an element in a variable if the element is id
[15:56:51] <sqram> like $foo = $('#foo')
[15:57:04] <shoky> yes. the element is not an id
[15:57:15] <sqram> but i thought elements with id get indexed
[15:57:32] <sqram> aka, it knows where in the dom tree it is, so it doesnt have to traverse looking for it
[15:58:05] <shoky> it still has to to do a bit of work. doesn't traverse the tree, correct
[15:58:05] <katronix> Hi all, I don't know a lot about jquery, however I need a way to validate that in 4 text boxes you only use each number once. Is there a pre-built Jquery Validator to do this?
[15:58:24] <shoky> sqram: even just doing $()  is a function call, no reason to call it twice
[15:58:49] <shoky> not to mention it causes a DOM API call
[15:59:10] <sqram> ok. so i have $foo = $('#foo').  now say I want to hide $foo, along with some other element. how could i?
[15:59:27] <Z3R0> $foo.hide(); ?
[15:59:28] <sqram> $($foo + ', #bar')
[15:59:30] <shoky> $foo.hide();   $otherelement.hide();  ?
[15:59:36] <sqram> all in one go though
[15:59:41] <shoky> why?
[15:59:50] <sqram> $('#' + $foo.attr('id')  + ', #bar')
[15:59:52] <homm_berger> ok gang, here's a jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/bp29mgt5/3/ . it is giving errors but i copied/pasted the JS code I have offline that's referenced in wordpress, does anyone know how to set it up correctly for jsfiddle to test?
[15:59:56] <shoky> anyways $foo.add('#bar').hide()
[16:00:22] <shoky> sqram ^
[16:00:25] <sqram> because bar is a child of foo, so i figued it'd be quicker than doing  2 separate calls
[16:00:25] <homm_berger> that's the JS for the owl carousel which i guess we can't reference but i don't think that's important
[16:00:42] <shoky> it's not quicker
[16:01:02] <shoky> especially not if you go looking for $foo again ;)
[16:01:30] <Z3R0> question homm_berger
[16:01:36] <Z3R0> do you always want that into #swatches-clone ?
[16:01:39] <sqram> shoky: good point
[16:01:47] <katronix> anyone?
[16:02:27] <Karie91> brb
[16:02:34] <homm_berger> yep, it's like a stationary separate portion and each fabric has info below it that is unique, so i want the unique information of each into a separate stationary/static square, z3ro
[16:02:40] <homm_berger> Z3R0 *
[16:03:03] <homm_berger> i have the owl nav clone div there but that I couldn't get to work because it was JS cloning it and JS generating it so that's kind of vestigeal
[16:03:24] <homm_berger> couple of vestigeal parts in this i suppose, but i hope enough main structure is there to replicate it
[16:04:40] <Z3R0> ok taking a stab at it, loaded it into my server
[16:05:32] <homm_berger> thank you so much Z3R0, i really appreciate it. figured it would be easier than it seems to be! thank you
[16:06:04] <Z3R0> erm
[16:06:06] <Z3R0> it works for me ?
[16:06:17] <homm_berger> it moves it to the div?!!?
[16:06:22] <Z3R0> although of course, it dies because of me not having owl carasoul
[16:06:29] <Z3R0> it won’t move… it copies...
[16:06:46] <homm_berger> yeah yeah
[16:06:52] <homm_berger> the jsfiddle works for you?
[16:06:54] <Z3R0> sec
[16:07:01] <Z3R0> didn’t do it in fiddle, did it on my server
[16:07:05] <Z3R0> let me update fiddle
[16:07:07] <homm_berger> aha
[16:07:29] <Z3R0> but it also depends on what youa re trying to move into there
[16:07:33] <Z3R0> because the stuff you are moving doesn’t have any info
[16:07:38] <Z3R0> so you don’t see any live update
[16:07:43] <Z3R0> I saw it in inspector
[16:07:44] <katronix> or does jquery validate have their own channel?
[16:08:33] <Z3R0> homm_berger: https://gist.github.com/SeoRoman/94477735ec3f12624f3d64a8623c3ee8
[16:08:35] <Z3R0> notice the html
[16:08:45] <homm_berger> the stuff i'm trying to move is all that green twirls wording
[16:09:10] <Z3R0> that’s all the code I used to test with
[16:09:12] <homm_berger> oh wow
[16:09:29] <homm_berger> so what the heck is going wrong on my end??
[16:09:44] <Z3R0> might be the carasoul ?
[16:09:49] <Z3R0> or u might have an error in console ?
[16:10:02] <Z3R0> the owl missing caused me to halt and it stopped my script
[16:13:42] <katronix> I need a way to validate that in 4 text boxes you only use each number once. Is there a pre-built Jquery Validator to do this?
[16:31:43] <silverdust> Why is jsbin just throwing out all that code in the console? I expect just a dom element to be returned
[16:31:45] <silverdust> http://jsbin.com/fiyeha/edit?html,js,console,output
[16:54:11] <sillyslux> Karie91, well i managed to add items that are loaded via ajax but it's quite painful
[16:58:38] <shoky> silverdust: that's just how jsbin's console shows objects. you're logging a jquery object, has many internal properties & methods, as do DOMElements
[17:11:58] <katronix> Anyone available to help?
[17:13:13] <raid3n`> how i can add class on sag ><
[17:13:17] <raid3n`> svg*
[17:16:09] <sillyslux> katronix idk of any validator plugins
[17:16:39] <sillyslux> but i'd help you in a fiddle
[17:16:50] <raid3n`> nobody ?
[17:17:33] <sillyslux> raid3n`, $('#mysvg').addClass('itsclass') i guess..
[17:17:47] <katronix> sillyslux: that works, my issue should be pretty easy to figure out I would think. Have 4 input boxes, they can take numbers between 1 and 4, how do you make sure each is unque?
[17:18:16] <sillyslux> we'll see
[17:18:39] <raid3n`> sillyslux, i test
[17:19:43] <raid3n`> but sillyslux
[17:19:44] <raid3n`> fr.circle55b.attr({title: "circle55b", href: "#294"});
[17:19:57] <raid3n`> i can't add
[17:20:15] <raid3n`> fr.circle55b.attr({title: "circle55b", href: "#294"}).addClass('itsclass'); ??
[17:25:55] <sillyslux> ah to elements inside an svg? i thought you meant the svg element itself.. sry don't know
[17:26:42] <raid3n`> sillyslux, https://martinwolf.org/blog/2014/12/adding-and-removing-classes-from-svg-elements-with-jquery
[17:27:03] <raid3n`> it's specific ..
[17:27:07] <katronix> sillyslux: hows it going? Sorry I don't know Javascript at all, or I'd try to figure it out myself, I just know doing it in PHP would be a mistake.
[17:27:26] <decx> why
[17:28:00] <sillyslux> who would think of that...
[17:28:39] <katronix> sillyslux: what?
[17:32:17] <sillyslux> yes yes
[17:32:18] <sillyslux> wait
[17:32:20] <sillyslux> :)
[17:35:51] <raid3n`> sillyslux, :}
[17:35:52] <raid3n`> $('#canvas_france a').each(function(i){$(this).attr('class', 'a-class another-class my-class')});
[17:35:54] <raid3n`> thanks
[17:36:50] <sillyslux> ya
[17:36:56] <sillyslux> learned something myself
[17:37:07] <sillyslux> but why not addClass?? WHY???
[17:37:42] <raid3n`> i dont know perhaps the browser don't support
[17:41:14] <katronix> sillyslux: hows it going?
[17:48:36] <juria_roberts> I am making a jquery ajax request for an image file. How do I check if the image is in browser cache before making the ajax request?
[17:49:23] <sillyslux> katronix, sry... https://jsfiddle.net/jaowwfgc/1/
[17:52:20] <katronix> sillyslux: not sure I understand the javascript code, the line that is being called invalid, is actually what I want, the line called valid, is actually wrong because 2 is duplicated, or is that just a bug in the script?
[17:55:33] <sillyslux> there is a bug
[17:55:40] <sillyslux> more than one actually..
[17:55:59] <sillyslux> but what you want is get all elements that you want to check
[17:56:07] <sillyslux> get their values
[17:56:18] <sillyslux> get an ordinary array
[17:56:40] <sillyslux> and see if there is a duplicate, if so return fals
[17:56:40] <sillyslux> e
[17:57:13] <katronix> ok
[17:58:54] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/jaowwfgc/3/
[18:03:49] <sillyslux> katronix, mmm this one checks live https://jsfiddle.net/jaowwfgc/4/
[18:03:59] <sillyslux> on keypress
[18:12:56] <katronix> sillyslux: thanks!
[18:14:18] <katronix> sillyslux: sorry to show my ignorance, but for this to go into a live web page, I'd put it in the head section is that correct?
[18:18:35] <sillyslux> well that depends
[18:19:36] <sillyslux> the input elements have to exist for $('input') to find them
[18:20:32] <sillyslux> if they are there on page load you can put the code in the head section inside $(document).ready(function(){...})
[18:23:10] <sillyslux> katronix, ^
[18:30:48] <katronix> sillyslux: thanks
[18:43:40] <sillyslux> :)
[18:59:19] <coder7of9> i am using datepicker.dateFormat('DD M d, yy') and the date is correct however the DD parameter returns Sunday not Monday. Is it a bug ro is there a configuration I am missing. This also happens if I user new Date() or new Date(2016,06,20)
[19:00:37] <coder7of9> correction new Date() is correct but not new Date(2016,06,20)
[19:01:22] <coder7of9> the later returns Wednesday Jul 20, 2016
[19:02:51] <coder7of9> okay it is  ajavascript date issue.... thanks
[19:30:22] <guest912> hey
[19:30:39] <guest912> whats happening people
[22:10:11] <katronix> Hi all can someone look at http://pastebin.com/552Rs47t for me? Trying to get the Javascript checkall to work, currently getting 2 errors: Unexpected end of input on line 55, and checkall is unknown on line 89
[22:17:33] <katronix> anyone here?
[22:17:48] <silverdust> yes
[22:18:05] <silverdust> I just looked in here
[22:18:26] <katronix> are you able to help silverdust?
[22:18:46] <katronix> Can you look at http://pastebin.com/552Rs47t for me? Trying to get the Javascript checkall to work, currently getting 2 errors: Unexpected end of input on line 55, and checkall is unknown on line 89
[22:20:00] <silverdust> I'm taking a look at it
[22:20:07] <katronix> thanks :)
[22:23:03] <silverdust> katronix: You're using comma for semi-colon?
[22:24:16] <katronix> someone in here, wrote the checkall code, I just copied and pasted it
[22:26:23] <silverdust> What's it meant to do?
[22:26:57] <katronix> I have web pages that has 4 text boxes, Its to make sure that the numbers 1 to 4 are used, with no duplicates
[22:32:17] <silverdust> Hard to believe someone from here gave that code. It's just convoluted
[22:32:34] <silverdust> Can you reproduce a test case in jsfiddle
[22:33:23] <katronix> silverdust: https://jsfiddle.net/jaowwfgc/4/
[22:35:27] <silverdust> well all it was missing for `Unexpected end of input on line 55` was a closing brace
[22:35:42] <silverdust> You needed a } to close the checkall function
[22:36:02] <silverdust> That's probably what also caused the function to not be available on line 89
[22:36:48] <katronix> silverdust: okay will try it now
[22:37:59] <katronix> silverdust: okay it works now, I suppose for it to display on the page, it needs a <span></span> ?
[22:40:17] <katronix> silverdust or can it also make the button non functional till the form is filled out correctly?
[22:42:19] <katronix> if your still there that is
[22:45:03] <silverdust> It's still don't really follow the code. Maybe I would if I wasn't so exhausted from a busy day but yes I think that's a better thing to do
[22:45:25] <silverdust> Instead of doing it on keyup of every input just check before submit
[22:46:16] <katronix> silverdust: can you show me how I would edit the code for that? and make the button not work till the boxes are correct?
[22:50:06] <katronix> or anyone else for that matter :)
[22:53:37] <katronix> or do I just change keyup to submit?
[22:53:42] <silverdust> I'm sorry katronix. I'd have really loved to help but I'm not sticking around that long. I didn't even know I was in #jquery . I just looked on the IRC to see a friend :)
[22:54:00] <katronix> silverdust: no problem :)
[22:54:05] <katronix> silverdust: thanks for your help
[22:55:22] <silverdust> but here's a short version of what you can do $('yourform').on('submit', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); // do the check here and if everything is fine $(this).submit(); })
[22:57:48] <katronix> silverdust: that would go between </body> and </html> right?
[22:59:08] <silverdust> It'd be better if you have it in a separate file and reference it before </body> as <script src="myscript.js"></script>
[22:59:31] <katronix> ok
[23:43:44] <bambanx> any free easy cool slider guys?
[23:46:49] <ryanneufeld> bambanx: there are many free sliders you can find with a google search
[23:47:41] <bambanx> i saw a few, but if someone have any recommendation
