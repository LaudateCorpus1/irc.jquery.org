[00:47:39] <Cork> rocketmagnet: $('<script>', { src: p }).appendTo('head');
[00:47:46] <Cork> rocketmagnet: would be the exact convertion
[00:48:07] <Cork> the jquery way would just be $.getScript(p); though
[06:31:27] <Bluerate> hello, i created script for conditional question on survey https://pastebin.com/Dn6niK1U ... i tested it with qweb template but not working, any advice?
[07:07:25] <Cork> Bluerate: you can't bind events on html so line 10 won't ever work
[07:08:07] <Cork> also i would recommend to not have scripts inline in the template
[07:08:26] <Cork> separating the two makes the code much simpler to maintain
[08:16:09] <tona> hello everyone
[08:16:58] <tona> I have one datatable using this structure, <table id="TableImported" class="table table-striped dataTable no-footer".   How could I change in jquery for this class "display compact nowrap"
[08:17:54] <Cork> tona: you mean change the class on the element?
[08:18:41] <tona> I would like to replace class "display compact nowrap"  instead of  class="table table-striped dataTable no-footer"
[08:19:52] <Cork> $().removeClass('class names you want to remove').addClass('class names you want to add');
[08:20:37] <Cork> so you list the classes you want to add/remove space separated and it will leave the none listed classes as is
[08:23:59] <tona> thanks iit is working :)
[09:09:42] <silva> Hello, one question, I'm using SmartWizard an I want to disable the next button until the fields are validated. Is ths possible?
[09:15:34] <Cork> silva: that is prob specific enough to have to be to a dedicated support solution for SmartWizard
[09:29:07] <tona> hello everyone, I have one html page with  jquery too, I am loading it from my main html page I am using jquery.load("secondpage.html"), when I click on button to execute jquery.load I need to click twice in order to load it, I detected under my development console that  jquery is not found, but if I load my secondpage is run ok
[09:29:55] <Cork> tona: .load doesn't load a new page it loads a partial into the current page
[09:30:18] <Cork> so you sould not expact to change what css or js you need significantly
[09:30:35] <Cork> cause then things will most likely become wonky for you
[09:31:00] <tona> how could I reload one second page in my main page is there one way to do it
[09:31:43] <Cork> that would be a normal page navigation
[09:31:56] <Cork> and you do that by setting window.location to the new url
[09:32:25] <Cork> but an option might be to just make the js dependencies more similar between the two pages
[10:00:44] <sydbarret> hi
[10:00:54] <sydbarret> anybody has used datatables?
[10:03:58] <sydbarret> https://datatables.net/reference/option/stateSave
[10:04:22] <sydbarret> can somebody explain me this line? localStorage.setItem( 'DataTables_' + settings.sInstance, JSON.stringify(data) )
[10:06:13] <sydbarret> specifically  'DataTables_' + settings.sInstance
[10:15:04] <shoky> sydbarret: sInstance is most likely some instance identifier for the datatables instance (you can have more than 1 on a page). this is just creating a localStorage key that is unique to this instance
[10:16:21] <sydbarret> shoky but in the page the datatable is rendered as id="DataTables_Table_0_wrapper"
[10:16:43] <sydbarret> is that what is getting formed by  'DataTables_' + settings.sInstance ?
[10:17:07] <shoky> sydbarret: donno, i don't think so
[10:17:19] <shoky> it shouldn't really matter to you
[10:18:12] <sydbarret> i have on my code <table class="table table-sm table-striped table-bordered datatable datatable-action">
[10:18:30] <sydbarret> no id
[10:18:40] <shoky> so?
[10:18:51] <sydbarret> so
[10:18:58] <sydbarret>  'DataTables_' + settings.sInstance
[10:19:17] <sydbarret> is just like an automatic way to refer to a datatable?
[10:19:33] <shoky> automatic..?
[10:19:37] <shoky> i told you what it is
[10:20:22] <sydbarret> sInstance is supposedly the table id?
[10:20:50] <shoky> no
[10:20:56] <sydbarret> well you said its an instance table identifier?
[10:21:08] <shoky> it is an identifier. it's not the "id" attribute of the <table>
[10:21:49] <sydbarret> yes but where that variable came for?
[10:22:02] <shoky> comes from datatables
[10:22:21] <sydbarret> so its like a property of the settings that is built in in the datatable?
[10:22:25] <shoky> yep
[10:22:37] <shoky> at least, so it seems to me
[10:23:04] <sydbarret> but where is that documented?
[10:23:15] <shoky> i don't know. it might not be documented
[10:23:57] <sydbarret> i think is in the function
[10:23:59] <sydbarret> let me check it
[10:24:16] <shoky> https://datatables.net/reference/type/DataTables.Settings
[10:24:31] <shoky> The structure of this object is considered to be private in terms of the DataTables API and reading or writing to the values in the object is not supported. The property names and values contained within the object can, will and do change between versions!
[10:24:54] <shoky> so, it's not documented
[10:27:30] <sydbarret> shoky here it says something about using your own key? https://datatables.net/reference/option/stateSave#Comments
[10:28:30] <shoky> yes? if you want to use your own ky
[10:28:31] <shoky> key
[10:28:48] <sydbarret> and where is that
[10:28:59] <sydbarret> i only have defined the table as
[10:29:08] <sydbarret>  <table class="table table-sm table-striped table-bordered datatable datatable-action">
[10:29:19] <shoky> where is what
[10:29:27] <sydbarret> the key that it says
[10:29:40] <shoky> huh?  it's your own key, can be whatever you want
[10:29:59] <sydbarret> you mean any number?
[10:29:59] <shoky> it's in your head ;]
[10:30:04] <sydbarret>  localStorage.setItem( 'YourKeyName', JSON.stringify( data ) );
[10:30:07] <shoky> any string
[10:30:27] <sydbarret> let me try it
[10:30:51] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/setItem
[10:35:00] <sydbarret> ok thanks
[10:41:48] <Phruis`> I am using serialize and it works great, but I am using it in an ajax request and I would like for each of the values to be send in the ajax request as their original form values
[10:41:52] <Phruis`> any idea how to do that?
[10:42:39] <Phruis`> would i have to loop over it and create some sort of object?
[10:46:35] <shoky> Phruis`: you want to submit the original form values? even if they have been edited?  then you need to store the original values somewhere before they are changed..
[10:47:50] <Phruis`> shoky, no sorry I just mean in my ajax request I have data { $('#filter-form').serialize() } and it would just do form_field_name : form_field_value
[10:48:21] <Phruis`> ive never seen that before but was curious if it is possible
[10:48:29] <shoky> i don't understand what you mean
[10:48:41] <shoky> if what is possible?
[10:48:52] <shoky> serialize already gives you field names and values..
[10:49:06] <Phruis`> ok
[10:51:21] <Phruis`> i guess my variable isn't being seen as a variable
[10:51:41] <Phruis`> and if i put $('#filter-form').serialize() it gives an error
[10:51:51] <shoky> no idea what you're doing
[10:54:08] <Phruis`> shoky, i am trying to get dynamic data in my ajax request
[10:55:43] <shoky> Phruis` that doesn't really clarify much.  dynamic data from where? not from the form fields?
[10:56:22] <Phruis`> shoky, i have to manually before hand in my ajax request type data { form_field_name: form_field_value }
[10:56:26] <Phruis`> i dont want to do that
[10:56:54] <Phruis`> i want to dynamically with jquery get that data { $('#filter-form').serialize() }
[10:56:57] <Phruis`> something like that
[10:57:05] <shoky> Phruis`:  that's what .serialize() is for, then.   data: $('form').serialize()
[10:57:24] <Phruis`> shoky, what if I have other data as well besides just the form?
[10:58:26] <shoky> Phruis`: then you can look at .serializeArray() which gives you an array of objects, one for each form field.  you can modify this array and add your own fields to it. and you can pass the array as 'data' option too
[10:58:51] <Phruis`> shoky, ok thanks i will look into that
[11:01:37] <shoky> Phruis` and if you prefer it as an object instead of an array you can .reduce the array e.g.   $('form').serializeArray().reduce((obj, field) => ({...obj, [field.name]: field.value}))
[11:01:56] <shoky> that'll give you { form_field_name: form_field_value, ... }
[11:02:26] <shoky> Phruis`: sorry should be:  $('form').serializeArray().reduce((obj, field) => ({...obj, [field.name]: field.value}), {})
[12:13:44] <Phruis`> shoky, that works perfectly except it doesn't seem to work after the page loads
[12:23:38] <robertmaxrees> Phruis`` mind clarifying what you mean by that?
[13:22:14] <Phruis`> robertmaxrees, basically when the page is rendered everything is fine
[13:22:38] <Phruis`> but I have an onchange event through jquery and when my ajax is then triggered again it doesn't pull in that new data
[13:22:45] <Phruis`> it is still using the data from the original load
[13:22:55] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing your code?
[13:23:18] <Phruis`> $.fn.getFormValues = function getFormValues() {
[13:23:18] <Phruis`> 							// formValues =
[13:23:18] <Phruis`> 							return $('#filter-form').serializeArray().reduce((obj, field) => ({...obj, [field.name]: field.value}), {});;
[13:23:18] <Phruis`> 						}
[13:23:21] <robertmaxrees> erm
[13:23:23] <robertmaxrees> not in the channel.
[13:23:26] <Phruis`> that is my function I put in the data { }
[13:23:36] <robertmaxrees> in context in a fiddle would be idea.
[13:23:38] <robertmaxrees> *ideal
[13:27:28] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[13:45:56] <Paul1337> Hello

[13:47:52] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, just ask.  if somebody can help, they will.
[13:49:15] <Paul1337> can anyone help me with this js chatbot https://codepen.io/abhinav43/pen/MWWVNgW
[13:49:23] <Paul1337> What i want is just take input from user and call one api and show the result from api
[13:49:30] <Paul1337> api is http://httpbin.org/post
[13:49:37] <Paul1337> and json data is payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
[13:49:44] <Paul1337> how to call this api in js and show the result to user
[13:49:51] <Paul1337> I mean take input from user fill in payload call the api and show the result
[13:49:57] <Paul1337> I tried few examples in js but couldn't figure it out
[13:50:04] <Paul1337> any type of help will be appreciated.
[13:50:05] <robertmaxrees> Paul1337 break the problem down an simplify it :)
[13:50:22] <Paul1337> Ok so there is one chatbot in js
[13:50:27] <robertmaxrees> slow down
[13:50:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:50:37] <Paul1337> it's taking input and showing some random text
[13:50:43] <robertmaxrees> break the problem down - first step: you need to get user input, right?
[13:50:59] <Paul1337> i want to call one api and show the response
[13:51:03] <robertmaxrees> right
[13:51:06] <Paul1337> yes
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> with user input, right?
[13:51:21] <Paul1337> first step : i want to take user input
[13:51:38] <Paul1337> second step : call the api with that input
[13:51:56] <Paul1337> third step : show the response of api on chatbot screen
[13:52:10] <robertmaxrees> perfect!  so let's solve step 1.
[13:52:28] <robertmaxrees> do you know how to select elements using jquery?
[13:53:16] <Paul1337> I am a backend programmer more into python stuff, I don't have any idea about js, JQUERY, i tried to search and try some example how to call api in jquery js
[13:53:22] <Paul1337> but couldn't find working one
[13:53:30] <robertmaxrees> you're getting ahead of yourself.
[13:53:34] <robertmaxrees> start from the beginning.
[13:53:49] <robertmaxrees> do you know how to select elements using jquery?
[13:53:57] <Paul1337> getelementbyid?
[13:54:02] <robertmaxrees> using jquery
[13:54:09] <Paul1337> No, sorry
[13:55:03] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/
[13:55:05] <robertmaxrees> i would start here.
[13:55:15] <robertmaxrees> this will teach you pretty much everything you need to know.
[13:56:26] <Paul1337> Sure, but I am in the middle of something where I have to show output of python backend here and I don't have time to learn from scratch :/
[13:56:41] <Paul1337> I'll learn later for sure but I need quick help
[13:56:53] <robertmaxrees> then you're in the wrong room :/
[13:57:16] <robertmaxrees> like... https://i.imgur.com/SUDEvqd.png
[13:57:24] <robertmaxrees> this tells you how to do these things.
[13:58:06] <Paul1337> And how to call an api
[13:58:18] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[14:05:18] <norbert> hi; if I may ask a question, I'm running into a strange ajax() issue; the calls fails in about 1 out of 200; when it succeeds the "Timings" tab of the Developer Tools show 'Waiting 63ms, Receiving 10ms' and when it fails 'DNS resolution 1ms' (and nothing more); also, if it fails the Security tab of Developer Tools is missing; when it fails, it throws the error:function(){alert("...");} message; when it fails it does not appear to send any
[14:05:18] <norbert> "Params"; when it fails also missing are all response headers, the "Remote address: ...", the "Status code: 200 OK" and the "Version: HTTP/1.1"; personally, I'm guessing this is some kind of DNS issue? anyone have any thoughts/suggestions? again, only fails 1 in about 200 or so, so I can't quickly test - but it definitely fails if I just keep doing the ajax().
[14:05:23] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[14:05:28] <norbert> haha :)
[14:05:33] <robertmaxrees> norbert break that down.
[14:05:39] <norbert> well, trying to help the helpers with lots of info
[14:05:47] <robertmaxrees> my eyes are glazing over already ;)
[14:06:30] <robertmaxrees> without seeing what's going on or any code or w/e, it's almost impossible to help there.
[14:14:48] <Paul1337> @robertmaxrees I tried to call api like this https://hastebin.com/xusalaxaji.js
[14:14:57] <Paul1337> but not getting the output
[14:15:03] <robertmaxrees> and what happened?
[14:15:10] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:15:18] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[14:15:26] <robertmaxrees> what about the network tab?  how does that look?
[14:15:34] <Paul1337> It's not showing output in console
[14:15:41] <robertmaxrees> and the network tab of your dev tools?
[14:16:18] <Paul1337> I didn't check that, As i said I have very minimal knowledge of frontend side
[14:16:26] <robertmaxrees> then check it :)
[14:18:15] <robertmaxrees> also: slap // in front of the url property on that settings object.
[14:18:26] <Paul1337> Failed to load response data
[14:18:53] <norbert> regarding the issue I'm running into, this is the Network tab https://i.imgur.com/6yKIpIq.png and it appears the (last) request that fails tried to fetch over non-httpS (non-SSL) for some reason
[14:19:11] <robertmaxrees> you need to make sure you make the url relative to the current page's protocol Paul1337 - "url": "//dummy_api.com/output",
[14:19:21] <robertmaxrees> norbert show some code pls.
[14:19:33] <robertmaxrees> screenshots of things is rarely helpful.
[14:21:38] <norbert> robertmaxrees: https://paste.debian.net/1114773/
[14:21:46] <norbert> screenshots of code ;)
[14:21:59] <robertmaxrees> except this i can validate ;)
[14:22:21] <robertmaxrees> kill the dataType
[14:22:22] <norbert> anyway, about 1 in 200 or so it's showing the alert ("Error calling videos.php.");
[14:22:49] <norbert> I'm returning json
[14:22:50] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, dunno still.
[14:23:03] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: just trying to give ideas of things to try homeslice.
[14:23:27] <robertmaxrees> you're describing a bug that happens inconsistently and only giving me part of the frontend JS.
[14:23:44] <norbert> true
[14:23:58] <robertmaxrees> hard to troubleshoot when i don't have the issue in front of me.
[14:24:00] <norbert> inconsistent bugs suck, either way
[14:25:13] <norbert> I think maybe I could fix it by hardcoding the url to "https://<domain>/videos.php"
[14:25:33] <robertmaxrees> you said the URL is "randomly" going to http://
[14:25:35] <robertmaxrees> right?
[14:26:26] <norbert> well, I'm running the ajax() from httpS, but according to https://i.imgur.com/6yKIpIq.png it still - for some reason - looks via non-SSL
[14:26:43] <norbert> last line on the image
[14:26:45] <robertmaxrees> for just that one call, right?
[14:26:54] <norbert> yeah
[14:27:05] <norbert> maybe my Firefox cannot verify the certificate or something
[14:27:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd triple check to make sure there isn't a redirect or something happening.
[14:27:12] <robertmaxrees> nah, it can.
[14:27:19] <robertmaxrees> this sounds like it might be server-side.
[14:27:31] <norbert> it's a VPS and I'm root
[14:27:32] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to hardcode the URL.
[14:27:36] <robertmaxrees> so?
[14:27:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:27:45] <robertmaxrees> could still have a bug in your server-side code.
[14:27:46] <norbert> just saying, I can check any logs if necessary
[14:27:52] <robertmaxrees> then check logs.
[14:28:01] <norbert> did, couldn't find anything :)
[14:28:03] <robertmaxrees> see if the system is redirecting users.
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> then add more logging ;)(
[14:28:10] <robertmaxrees> * ;)
[14:28:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:35:30] <norbert> you think it might help if I'd add "async: false", or not enough code to tell?
[14:36:18] <robertmaxrees> never use async: false
[14:36:32] <robertmaxrees> plus that'll have no bearing on this issue.
[14:36:55] <norbert> ok
[14:37:34] <norbert> I think I should expand error:function() to show the exception code/messages
[14:37:38] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:37:45] <robertmaxrees> that could work.
[14:37:49] <norbert> yeah, I'll do that
[14:48:06] <Phruis`> if you are inside a jquery object how can you reference itself?
[14:48:18] <robertmaxrees> Phruis` what do you mean?
[14:48:21] <Phruis`> this doesn't work and neither does $()
[14:48:52] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're trying to do.
[14:48:54] <Phruis`> robertmaxrees, i finally got that ajax/serialize problem worked out and I wrapped it in a function in the ajax call and all is good, but now I want to get the state
[14:49:08] <Phruis`> just need to figure out how to reference itself
[14:49:10] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing your code in a paste.
[14:49:12] <Phruis`> inside the wrapper
[14:49:19] <robertmaxrees> that changes depending on exactly what you're doing.
[14:49:24] <robertmaxrees> hence why i'm asking to see some code.
[14:52:23] <Phruis`> $('#blah').Function({ data : function blahblah() { how do I get the jquery object I am in } } );
[14:52:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:52:39] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense.
[14:53:14] <Phruis`> $('#blah').Function({ ajax { data : function blahblah() { how do I get the jquery object I am in } } } );
[14:53:19] <robertmaxrees> are you in an ajax call's success callback you mean?
[14:53:24] <Phruis`> no
[14:53:37] <Phruis`> it is an object being created that makes an ajax request inside
[14:53:52] <Phruis`> but the function i am talking about is related to the data : information that is pass
[14:53:59] <robertmaxrees> that isn't valid js.
[14:54:02] <robertmaxrees> which is why i'm confused.
[14:54:16] <Phruis`> you know classes right?
[14:54:20] <Phruis`> its a class
[14:54:28] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/XBNJC
[14:54:31] <Phruis`> you pass in config info
[14:54:44] <robertmaxrees> that is invalid code.
[14:54:48] <robertmaxrees> show me valid JS.
[14:55:30] <Phruis`> $('#blah').MyClass({ ajax { data : function blahblah() { how do I get the jquery object I am in } } } );
[14:55:55] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[14:56:12] <robertmaxrees> that still won't work since it's not valid JS.  do you mean ajax: { ?
[14:56:29] <Phruis`> it is a config object for the class
[14:56:35] <robertmaxrees> it's invalid js.
[14:56:39] <robertmaxrees> so it won't work.
[14:56:56] <Phruis`> well of course not because "how do i get the jquery object i am in" was just a place holder
[14:57:04] <robertmaxrees> and you're missing a colon
[14:57:32] <robertmaxrees> either way, check out https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[14:58:11] <robertmaxrees> this will show you how to properly create a plugin.
[15:00:01] <Phruis`> ok thanks
[15:05:28] <norbert> I tried https://paste.debian.net/1114786/ and after minutes of trying it finally failed (as it sometimes does) and just gave me 1 pop-up (the first alert, I guess) with just "undefined", so I've now removed the second and third lines to give it another try in the hopes to get the status and error pop-ups
[15:06:20] <robertmaxrees> are are you using alert and not console.log()?
[15:06:35] <julius123> hi
[15:06:37] <norbert> yeah, should I use console.log() instead?
[15:06:42] <robertmaxrees> always.
[15:06:46] <robertmaxrees> alert just prints out strings.
[15:06:57] <robertmaxrees> console.log will let you actually browse objects and stuff.
[15:06:59] <norbert> hm, ok; thanks, I'll do the console log from now on
[15:07:59] <robertmaxrees> alert also blocks the browser, which sucks.
[15:09:15] <NDT> I have something on local dev that works perfectly fine, when uploaded to server it gives [Uncaught ReferenceError: schemas is not defined] Anyone have an idea on how to fix that? Not a javascript guy lol. https://pastebin.com/uDChWSsC  also, why am I not getting the same error on local?
[15:09:33] <robertmaxrees> var schemas(); doesn't make sense.
[15:09:46] <NDT> oh shit sorry yeah ignore that
[15:09:50] <robertmaxrees> erm
[15:09:51] <NDT> that isnt really there
[15:09:53] <robertmaxrees> so show me the real code?
[15:09:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:10:05] <robertmaxrees> where do you define schemas ?
[15:11:05] <NDT> Thisis how it really is on local and real server https://pastebin.com/U7g0NAxL
[15:11:19] <robertmaxrees> so... where do you define schemas ?
[15:12:32] <NDT> in jtools.js which is loaded first var schemas = [];
[15:12:48] <robertmaxrees> can you show me more of "jtools.js"?
[15:12:59] <robertmaxrees> for instance, is var schemas = []; defined in an array?
[15:13:08] <robertmaxrees> *defined in a function, rather.
[15:14:00] <NDT> https://pastebin.com/xGv60Gm7
[15:14:12] <robertmaxrees> and this file is successfully loading?
[15:15:20] <NDT> that is part of the file it has a bunch of schema markup in it that is like this... one sec
[15:15:34] <robertmaxrees> also: any js errors?
[15:16:13] <NDT> https://pastebin.com/vAuN2kwr
[15:16:22] <NDT> no js errors, runs perfectly fine on local
[15:16:35] <robertmaxrees> i mean on your live envirionment.
[15:16:43] <NDT> upload to server, get that... and looking in consol it loads all the files fine
[15:16:52] <robertmaxrees> get what?
[15:17:56] <NDT> live environment I get https://pastebin.com/4JSav659
[15:18:08] <robertmaxrees> right/
[15:18:13] <robertmaxrees> so is that file successfully loading?
[15:18:16] <robertmaxrees> that defines schemas
[15:18:23] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab in your dev tools and make sure.
[15:18:55] <NDT> yeah it is loading... I wonder if it is somehow loading after that
[15:19:03] <robertmaxrees> could be worth checking.
[15:19:19] <robertmaxrees> also ANY js errors can cause problems with stuff like this, too.
[15:20:56] <NDT> yeah, not much of a javascript guy do all the PHP work... run into things like this from time to time that drive me nuts, since I don't see how this can change from local to dev... \o/
[15:21:10] <robertmaxrees> all sorts of things can be in play.
[15:21:18] <robertmaxrees> whcih is why i'm having you poke around.
[15:25:00] <NDT> friggin loading order... somehoe on local loads right, on server it doesn't... fml with wasted time
[15:25:05] <NDT> lol thanks man ;)
[15:25:08] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[15:25:10] <robertmaxrees> sounds like cache
[15:28:56] <NDT> yeah I thought so, cleared everything... still runs on local fine way it was.. now runs on live though, after moving things around lol
[15:29:03] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[16:11:49] <norbert> \o/~ laters!
