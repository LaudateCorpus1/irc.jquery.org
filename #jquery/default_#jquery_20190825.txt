[07:20:59] <rocketmagnet> hi everyone
[07:22:01] <rocketmagnet> i'm new to javascript and i want to learn how to create slideshows with jquery, where does i have to start learning ? i'm a c/c++/php programmer already so i know programming but i'm new to javascript so i have no idea how to build a slideshow from ground up
[09:20:54] <deitarion> To some extent, it depends on what you want to show in it and how you want the transitions, if any, to look. The simplest possible slideshow would just be some code which asks the browser to preload the images (there are various ways you can google up) and then changes the `href` of an `<img>` element on a timer using a `setInterval` callback.
[09:26:21] <deitarion> Oh, yeah. I forgot I had "only show join/part for people actively talking" configured for the channels I normally chat in. Fixed.
[13:25:55] <inthl> there is a function called _redrawChildren at line 735 as seen here: https://github.com/DataTables/Responsive/blob/master/js/dataTables.responsive.js
[13:26:05] <inthl> can one please tell me how to overload/overwrite that function?
[13:26:26] <inthl> how would one do that? I would like to extend the function by a few lines actually
[17:23:35] <primitivMedia> if i want to round 359.92 to 360 what would i need to use
[17:23:43] <primitivMedia> math.round math.ceil dont seem to do the trick
[17:26:17] <primitivMedia> ceil should work yes?
[17:39:18] <Woet> primitivMedia: why does Math.round not "do the trick"?
[17:39:37] <Woet> Math.round perfectly rounds 359.92 to 360.
[17:41:58] <pavonia> Does ceil return a float by chance?
[18:08:26] <primitivMedia> 1 sec trying
[21:56:41] <primitivMedia> https://pastebin.com/bbAaE1TS
[21:56:50] <primitivMedia> for some reason it keeps telling me myFunction is undefined
[21:57:02] <primitivMedia> idk where i need to place it for it to work, doesnt seem to wanan pick it uo anywhere
[22:27:37] <pavonia> primitivMedia: It's not defined if your first case is true
[22:28:20] <pavonia> And probably not globally too
[22:28:49] <pavonia> It's not clear from your code how you are using it
