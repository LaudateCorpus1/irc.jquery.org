[06:30:35] <wanton7> hi is it possible to create .scope (func) extensions method that would return jQuery stack to position before .stack() was called? I have something like this now .closest("tbody").find(getSelector("delete")).closest("td").html("").end().end().end() but I would want to create extension method .scope() that would make it .scope(x => x.closest("tbody").find(getSelector("delete")).closest("td").html(""))
