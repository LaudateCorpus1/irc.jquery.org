[03:15:56] <bigLanky> on submit how can I get the value of my type="submit" button that was clicked?
[03:16:53] <Cork> bigLanky: ya... that is a big limitation in form submission: there isn't a clean way to do that
[03:17:16] <Cork> well cross browsers, firefox has a proprietary solution
[03:17:22] <bigLanky> on my form I have a button for "Save" and one for "Submit"
[03:17:29] <bigLanky> need to do something extra when Submit gets clicked
[03:17:34] <bigLanky> is there a better way to accomplish?
[03:17:49] <Cork> if possible use a checkbox or toggle button instead
[03:18:11] <Cork> else you would have to bind a click handle on the buttons and set a .data value on the form
[03:18:24] <Cork> $('form').on('click', 'button
[03:18:26] <Cork> opps
[03:18:27] <bigLanky> would I just set the value of another input field on .click before form gets submitted?
[03:18:48] <Cork> $('form').on('click', 'button', function() { $(this.form).data('button', this); });
[03:19:16] <Cork> then you can check $(this).data('button').val() in the submit event
[03:19:30] <Cork> uh, no
[03:19:39] <Cork> *then you can check $($(this).data('button')).val() in the submit event
[03:20:04] <Cork> that's the cleanest solution i've found as of yet
[03:20:10] <bigLanky> ok
[03:20:16] <bigLanky> will i need to change to input type=button?
[03:20:16] <Cork> bigLanky: don't forget that you can have a submit without clicking a button
[03:20:32] <bigLanky> i was thinking about your checkbox suggestion
[03:20:34] <Cork> bigLanky: i normally use <button type="submit"></button>
[03:20:43] <Cork> cause those are easier to style and so on
[03:20:58] <Cork> but you can use input[type="submit"] if you prefer
[03:21:02] <bigLanky> what if I made each checkbox look like the save/submit buttons do and when one gets toggled, set a value and submit the form
[03:21:26] <Cork> bigLanky: its a possible solution
[03:21:47] <Cork> but again don't forget that you can have a form sumbitted without any of those buttons clicked
[03:22:00] <Cork> (enter for example)
[03:22:15] <Cork> but there are more ways
[03:22:20] <bigLanky> true
[03:22:38] <Cork> and that is why i normally try to avoid using values on buttons
[03:23:00] <Cork> and instead have a check box like "[] create" or radio buttons
[03:23:50] <bigLanky> ah
[03:24:00] <bigLanky> thats a much better solution to use [] in the name
[03:24:15] <Cork> ah, no i meant a checkbox
[03:24:27] <bigLanky> thats what I meant, sorry
[03:25:37] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/nt0kvgqx/
[03:26:09] <bigLanky> yeah I think I am going to add a "finalize" checkbox to mine that works the same way
[08:22:54] <snfgf> hello
[08:25:21] <snfgf> so, I have a function from a plugin, $('#blah').doSomething(). How do I check if this exists on a page? Because $.doSomething, does not exist, even when the plugin is included
[08:28:54] <pavonia> if (typeof $.doSomething === "function") should work
[08:30:11] <MikeD_> $.fn.doSomething  ?
[08:39:33] <Cork> ya, its if($.fn.doSomething != undefined) {}
[08:40:35] <Cork> $.<function> is for things that are global functions, like $.ajax, $.get and $.param
[08:44:58] <z1haze> its been a bit since using jquery.. but what am i doing wrong here? $('.list-group-item').click(function(e) { $(this).find('.order-details__extended').slideToggle(); });
[08:45:36] <z1haze> Uncaught TypeError: $(...).slideToggle is not a function
[09:00:58] <Cork> z1haze: nothing https://jsfiddle.net/hc6armao/1/
[09:01:08] <Cork> z1haze: i would suspect $ isn't jquery
[09:01:20] <Cork> you could try with jQuery() instead of $()
[09:02:02] <z1haze> doesnt work either
[09:02:53] <z1haze> so weird
[09:03:01] <z1haze> unless im missing something really stupid
[09:04:28] <z1haze> ah yep, see doing something stupid. i grabbed the cdn for slim by mistake
[09:09:24] <Justice_W> I got $(window).on('storage', function stuff() {... but for some reason it triggers twice on different tabs
[09:16:05] <MikeD_> storage is an event?
[09:16:39] <MikeD_> hmm rtfm: yup
[09:16:45] <Justice_W> MikeD_: ya its LocalStorage when a key gets set or changed
[09:17:03] <Justice_W> really usefull when you want to update something in different tabs =)
[09:17:18] <Justice_W> but for some reason one gets updated once and second tab gets triggered twice
[09:17:28] <MikeD_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/storage:   fired when a storage area (localStorage or sessionStorage) has been modified
[09:17:41] <MikeD_> is the "twice" because of both types of storage?
[09:18:08] <Justice_W> im changing only local storage but if that would be the case would it not update twice in both tabs?
[09:18:30] <MikeD_> idk, can you log the .storageArea property and confirm?
[09:18:44] <Justice_W> what you mean?
[09:19:16] <MikeD_> function stuff( evt ) {  console.log( evt.storageArea ); }
[09:19:27] <Justice_W> ah nwm
[09:20:04] <Justice_W> when i remove the key localy it triggers a change then one tab connects db and sets localstorage that in turn triggers a change so the second tab in turn triggers twice.
[09:21:51] <Justice_W> hm just add a random timeout so both wont connect to db at the same time and i can live with that they query the localstorage twice.
[09:21:56] <MikeD_> hmm  - weirdness might force you to change your strategy for how/when to actually DO the stuff in the stuff() function :)
[09:22:18] <Justice_W> ya i have to add so it checks against what key
[09:22:30] <Justice_W> so it wont query every time i update any key in it.
[09:23:01] <MikeD_> or something like this: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[09:28:15] <Justice_W> ooh that I like
[09:28:40] <MikeD_> where the term "debounce" comes from is interesting history too
[09:30:13] <beshoo> after LONG works with my site a just note that jQuery .on('click',.. does not trigger in safari
[09:30:58] <beshoo> and changing all of that will be very annoying
[09:31:16] <beshoo> as i understand jQuery  is cross browsers
[09:31:33] <beshoo> it seems not !
[09:31:56] <Cork> beshoo: trigger on what?
[09:32:11] <Cork> it isn't as simple as event triggering or not
[09:32:12] <Justice_W> check also so its not racecondition
[09:35:06] <beshoo> Cork : $('.hello').on('click',function(){ console.log('clicked')});
[09:35:22] <Cork> beshoo: well that i can say works for me
[09:35:35] <Cork> you would have to provide a specific case that fails
[09:35:37] <beshoo> but not for me ! on mac
[09:35:50] <beshoo> no it is on Mac and iphone
[09:35:54] <beshoo> safari
[09:35:55] <Cork> beshoo: meaning it most likely is more complest then any event handler
[09:36:01] <Cork> *complex*
[09:36:12] * Cork afk
[09:36:35] <beshoo> Not just me
[09:36:36] <beshoo> https://www.google.nl/search?client=opera&q=safari+and+jquay+onclick&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=w08cWfbiAeGBwgKK4b7YDQ#q=safari+and+jquery+onclick
[09:38:57] <beshoo> After much research i understand that Safari isn't able to call the onClick Event like the other browsers do. So how do i get Safari to act like the other browsers is my question? I have see no real alternative. Can any of you help?
[09:41:26] <beshoo> and since i am Windows user and Apple has stopped developing  Safari  browser for Windows.! how can i test
[09:41:33] <beshoo> it is just a report form my clients
[09:56:45] <Justice_W> MikeD_: have you used debounce?
[09:57:08] <MikeD_> no
[09:58:50] <Justice_W> MikeD_: it works but im not getting any console.log or info from the function it runs -_-'
[10:01:29] <MikeD_> are the consoles tab-specific?
[10:02:03] <Justice_W> think im doing something wrong here..
[10:03:51] <Justice_W> MikeD_: inside the on storage i got; $.debounce(250, setTimeout(stuff, Math.floor(Math.random() * 5000)));
[10:04:11] <Justice_W> but im guessing the setTimeout is fooling it
[10:04:50] <MikeD_> why are you using setTimeout there?
[10:05:01] <Justice_W> i dont want all tabs triggering at the same time
[10:05:58] <MikeD_> $(".my-btn").click($.debounce(250, foo))
[10:07:37] <Justice_W> yes but on storage triggers on two different tabs
[10:10:57] <MikeD_> note that the .debounce() function is returning a function that should be used as the event handler
[10:11:12] <MikeD_> the way you wrote it, you're never actually doing anything with that returned function
[10:11:58] <MikeD_> the implementation is really just a wrapper for a timeout that gets reset each time the function is called
[10:13:05] <jomofcw> When I press the tab key to switch from an input[text] to another, how can i know the initial input in the keyup event (e.tyarget is the "another") ?
[10:13:12] <jomofcw> *e.target
[10:13:15] <jomofcw> please
[10:14:04] <MikeD_> jomofcw: make a jsfiddle.net ?
[10:22:44] <jomofcw> MikeD_ hello ! Here we go : https://jsfiddle.net/u8gyb5by/1/
[10:23:10] <jomofcw> In fact the "problem" is that the keyup fired after the switch to the other input.
[10:26:46] <MikeD_> so are you trying to do something on blur from A on on focus in B?
[10:30:31] <jomofcw> MikeD_ kinda : I've got TR elements containing INPUT elements. When I press TAB on the last INPUT of the last TR, I want to create a new TR with new INPUT elements (cloning the one as model).
[10:34:00] <MikeD_> i think you'd have an easier time using the blur event
[10:34:47] <Cork> jomofcw: if you want to use the tab key specifically you would have to use the keydown event not the keyup
[10:35:03] <Cork> blur is prob too late as it would men the tab order gets messed up
[10:37:10] <MikeD_> if I wanted to make another row before I get to the last input, how do i do that?
[10:37:29] <MikeD_> ... or is that last input a required field and you have to go all the way to it?
[10:38:23] <jomofcw> MikeD_ it's a required field.
[10:38:26] <jomofcw> Cork hello !
[10:38:49] <Cork> jomofcw: https://jsfiddle.net/u8gyb5by/3/
[10:39:00] <jomofcw> Yup^, some trpouble in test case... I get no "keyCode" when I press "tab" key in the keypress event :s... normal ?
[10:39:11] <MikeD_> if your UX design is concerned with "must be easy" then I'm wondering if having that blank row already there to be randomly accessible including by clicking to it... then on any use of that row you make a new blank row - but yeah, i'm changing your design for a feature you might not want
[10:39:32] <MikeD_> yeah, keypress isn't for tab or arrows or such
[10:39:52] <Cork> keypress isn't even a webstandard
[10:40:06] <jomofcw> Cork oh OK !
[10:40:21] <Cork> keyup is what windows talk about as keypress
[10:40:42] <Cork> keydown is what you want to use if you want to trigger on the key before the browser does anything with it
[10:41:20] <jomofcw> OK, understand ! I was wrong about the keypress event and it mess all the stuff. Let me try with keydown
[10:41:37] <Cork> jomofcw: check the link i gave you
[10:41:44] <Cork> it does exactly what you asked for
[10:42:03] <Cork> though MikeD_'s comment is good points you should give back to them
[10:42:18] <Cork> (though it isn't always possible to control what you have to implement)
[10:43:01] <jomofcw> Work greet now ! Thanks Cork and MikeD_ :D.
[10:44:30] <MikeD_> does it matter if you have blank rows?
[10:44:41] <jomofcw> Thanks for the fiddle too, it confirm me the right way to use.
[10:44:43] <MikeD_> because no way to remove the extras could be confusing too
[10:45:51] <jomofcw> MikeD_ my form is way more "complicated". look at http://www.luminis-films.com/films_pour_vitrages/film_occultant/film_depoli/Film-depoli-blanc-DEPOLI-300i (click on "Découpe AUX DIMENSIONS"). It's the buggy version live, i'm coding the fixed version.
[10:46:01] <MikeD_> it would be additionally nice to have the first input be focused so you could continue with keyboard entry
[10:46:09] <jomofcw> Done :P.
[10:46:52] <jomofcw> In fact as the lan is created before the key release (and so before the tab really happen) it automaticaly focus on the next input.
[10:47:13] <MikeD_> :)
[10:47:40] <MikeD_> i like UX design, it's frustrating that my team has so little understanding of the guiding principles
[10:48:57] <Justice_W> gah this makes my head cry
[10:49:04] <Justice_W> but who cares duplicate calls i can live with that
[10:51:45] <Es0teric> if i have something that converts hex values into emoji's and when an ajax call is dynamically made to load more content and the hex values dont get converted because of the ajax call, how do i make that ajax call render with the hex values converted?
[11:57:27] <MikeD_> i never noticed that you were two people
[11:59:17] <Violinist> hey
[11:59:23] <Violinist> wats up w bitbucket today
[11:59:33] <Violinist> did they get haked lol
[12:00:32] <robertmaxrees> https://status.bitbucket.org/
[12:02:21] <Violinist> that page is not acurate
[12:02:27] <Woet> can you not type complete words?
[12:03:22] <Violinist> that page woudlnt tel u if something went wrong w profiles
[12:03:31] <Woet> im guessing that means no
[12:03:36] <Violinist> woet clone ur hole lol
[12:03:38] <MikeD_> so what problem are you suggesting it's having?
[12:03:40] <Violinist> close
[12:03:53] <Violinist> damn nerds
[12:05:26] <Violinist> my avatar icon is gone
[12:07:26] <MikeD_> mine is not
[12:07:41] <Violinist> hmm
[12:52:26] <taplar> quiet today
[12:53:13] <jarard> hi
[12:53:36] <taplar> aloha
[12:53:56] <robertmaxrees> g'morning
[13:02:07] <jarard> anyone able to tell me why this toggle() isn't working
[13:02:26] <jarard> I am trying to select a div by class and its child div by id
[13:02:27] <jarard> https://jsfiddle.net/kw5f6v2j/
[13:03:24] <robertmaxrees> jarard you know that IDs must be unique per page, right?
[13:03:57] <jarard> yes - i only have one "errorbox"
[13:04:16] <robertmaxrees> so then just do $('#errorbox');  your second issue is your css it targeting  aparent element.
[13:04:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kw5f6v2j/1/
[13:04:38] <jarard> i have several popupAlerts and these are all hidden
[13:04:57] <taplar> ah, lol, ic
[13:05:09] <taplar> your parent is hidden, doesn't matter if  you show a child
[13:05:11] <jarard> so i wanted to target the required popupAlert and toggle visibility
[13:05:30] <jarard> perhaps my logic is a bit screwed?
[13:06:04] <taplar> you just gotta decide what part is the controlling element for displaying
[13:06:32] <jarard> for example: https://jsfiddle.net/kw5f6v2j/2/
[13:07:09] <taplar> yeah, but popupAlert is always hidden in your css, as said before
[13:07:53] <taplar> doesn't matter if you show or hide a nested element in it, if the parent is invisible, the children will be invisible
[13:08:24] <jarard> so this isn't selecting it: $('.popupAlert #errorbox').toggle();
[13:08:35] <jarard> it's selecting the #errorbox right?
[13:08:47] <taplar> yes
[13:08:56] <jarard> so why if i move the id to the parent div
[13:09:35] <jarard> *what
[13:09:57] <taplar> how are you changing the selector?
[13:10:11] <jarard> ah i see i think that works, as long as I rmeove the space
[13:10:18] <taplar> just select by the id
[13:10:19] <jarard> $('.popupAlert#errorbox').toggle();
[13:10:25] <taplar> just use the id
[13:10:44] <taplar> one of the fastest lookups your browser can do
[13:11:04] <jarard> but i have to first toggle the popupAlert class
[13:11:12] <taplar> id's cannot repeat
[13:11:14] <taplar> there will only be one
[13:11:33] <taplar> if you repeat ids that is invalid markup
[13:11:44] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[13:11:48] <robertmaxrees> and then things won't ever work right.
[13:11:57] <jarard> yeah of course, id's are unique
[13:12:07] <robertmaxrees> jarard are you toggling these depenmding on where the user clicks?
[13:12:27] <Violinist> omg that is invalid lol
[13:12:35] <Violinist> # takes precedence
[13:12:40] <taplar> huh?
[13:12:42] <robertmaxrees> Violinist it's not invalid.
[13:12:48] <robertmaxrees> it's just a strange way to do it.
[13:12:58] <Violinist> aliens
[13:13:05] <robertmaxrees> it's also one way to target an ID so long as it has a particular class.
[13:13:11] <robertmaxrees> which can be useful in some instances.
[13:13:12] <taplar> ^
[13:13:22] <jarard> i have one popup for success and one for failure, the class is common hence hidden
[13:13:41] <taplar> yeah, target those with separate ids
[13:13:43] <jarard> then a unique id for each
[13:13:43] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:13:55] <taplar> it will also read nicer
[13:13:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah, just target the IDs.
[13:14:18] <jarard> would that not mean I have to set the id's to be display:none
[13:14:28] <jarard> rather than the class
[13:14:36] <taplar> no
[13:14:41] <taplar> you can use the class for the default
[13:14:50] <taplar> show/hide/toggle will change the inline which will override that
[13:14:59] <taplar> so long as you don't stick an !important on your css
[13:15:13] <jarard> i never do that
[13:15:14] <jarard> !
[13:15:16] <taplar> good deal
[13:15:51] <jarard> so do you suggest the id set on the parent div with the class, or as a child
[13:16:10] <taplar> what is the parent object that encapsulates what you are wanting to show?
[13:16:18] <taplar> think modular
[13:16:49] <jarard> popupAlert - I did this is this a good solution
[13:16:50] <jarard> https://jsfiddle.net/kw5f6v2j/3/
[13:17:17] <taplar> sure, however i'd probably use show() instead of toggle()
[13:17:28] <jarard> ok - so i was over thinking this
[13:17:54] <jarard> i was assuming that I had to toggle/show the popupAlert then requirted id
[13:18:08] <jarard> so I learnd something thanks :)
[13:18:18] <jarard> i'll switch to show
[13:18:24] <taplar> nah, what's the first C in CSS ?
[13:19:05] <taplar> ;)
[13:19:44] <jarard> cascade
[13:21:36] <robertmaxrees> *-ing
[13:30:52] <jarard> it works thanks!
[15:06:40] <Es0teric> this is so wierd... when i do console.log() on $(this).text() it outputs the string but for some reason... when i run String.fromCodePoint( $(this).text() ); on the line right after it says $(this).text() is NaN
[15:06:45] <Es0teric> what could be causing that?
[15:15:17] <taplar> example?
[15:36:48] <am55> String.fromCodePoint( parseInt( $(this).text() ) );
[15:45:36] <taplar> i mean like a fiddle showing the issue
[15:47:46] <Es0teric> taplar i cant recreate it on a fiddle
[15:47:57] <Es0teric> there are too many variables that make it difficult to recreate
[15:48:32] <taplar> hard for me to help if I can't see the issue.  best i can say is debug it
[15:48:50] <taplar> breakpoints and all that shebang
[17:26:24] <Qiller> hi ppl, how can i find and focus next input using jQuery? https://jsfiddle.net/v26k1qse/
[17:27:07] <taplar> you want to find the element that has the focused class and get the next() off of it
[17:28:01] <taplar> however none of your logic is currently shifting that class so there is an issue there too
[17:29:48] <Qiller> yep
[17:29:50] <Qiller> omg kkk
[17:30:01] <taplar> also the <br> after the inputs are considered the next() element
[17:30:08] <Qiller> hmmm
[17:30:26] <duch_kazatel> imo don't use <br>
[17:30:57] <Qiller> example only
[17:31:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:31:20] <Qiller> how can i jump to the next unfocused input?
[17:31:38] <drej> why would you have to use jquery for that?
[17:31:41] <drej> the browser does it by default
[17:31:47] <drej> just set tabindex on the inputs
[17:31:53] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:32:01] <taplar> possibly just for learning purposes, is my guess
[17:32:03] <robertmaxrees> and then go to the next highest tabindex
[17:32:14] <drej> why not learn something worthwhile :)
[17:32:39] <drej> and yeah, dont use <br>s, thats not just taplar's opinion
[17:32:45] <drej> that's the internets' opinion
[17:32:46] <drej> ;)
[17:33:03] <taplar> my suggestion if you are doing this for learning, would be to shift your view slightly
[17:33:41] <taplar> instead of going for next(), get a reference to all the inputs first.  then your logic can find the index of the input currently selected and then you just go to index + 1 % total for the next one
[17:35:09] <Qiller> hmm
[17:35:12] <taplar> which would also allow for circular next, if that is desired
[17:40:57] <Qiller> taplar: cant i find if the next input has focused?
[17:41:14] <taplar> next() will be the next element, which in your markup is a br
[17:41:21] <taplar> so you would have to do next().next()
[17:41:50] <taplar> but the next input wouldn't have the focused class, from how i'm understanding your logic
[17:41:57] <taplar> you are trying to shift that to the next element, yes?
[17:42:38] <Qiller> next unfocused element
[17:43:17] <taplar> right, so you'd have to find the one that has that class, remove that class, next().next() to the next input, put the class on it, and focus
[17:43:35] <Qiller> hmm
[17:43:41] <taplar> if you are so determined to stick with next()
[19:20:14] <remyo> Why is it that offset().top won't work with targeted classes? If I use $(this).parent() it works fine, but $(this).closest('.some-element') won't.
[19:20:37] <robertmaxrees> does .some-element actually return something?
[19:21:35] <remyo> Yeah, absolutely, it's there. But what I get every time is: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[19:22:30] <robertmaxrees> that usually means you don't actually have an element.
[19:22:36] <robertmaxrees> try try $(this).closest('.some-element').length - what do you get?
[19:30:49] <remyo> robertmaxrees: Yeah, it's weird. It's saying 0 but the element is absolutely there.
[19:31:44] <remyo> The (this) in the equation is a jQuery generated element though so maybe it's the order of my script
[19:35:30] <remyo> Wow, that was indeed it, I was just defining things in the wrong order.
[19:35:37] <remyo> Thanks robertmaxrees!
[19:37:46] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[23:58:54] <aro> has anyone seen stuff with draggable/sortable elements getting 'stuck' when resorting them?
