[00:11:23] <xaxxon> I’m writing a greasemonkye script and I have a series of actions that depend on DOM changes from the previous actions to be visible.. I’m having an awful time trying to figure out a sane way to chain them together
[00:12:04] <xaxxon> I know how to click buttons and see if DOM changes have gone through.. but I’m ending up with a disgusting looking FSM for something that seems like it should be simple
[03:10:13] <Deusdeorum> suppose i have an input box with text in it, $(...).val('whatever') will remove whatever is in that input, can i add text to an input and keep the text in it?
[03:13:57] <Cork> Deusdeorum: you have to grab the current value and then add the combined result; but be warned the caret position will change
[03:15:29] <Deusdeorum> Cork hmmm, so like $('.input-class').val($('.input-class').val() + 'whatever') ? feels like im doing a misstake here
[03:15:34] <Deusdeorum> caret position?
[03:15:44] <Cork> text input position
[03:15:51] <Cork> the blinking |
[03:15:58] <Cork> its called a caret
[03:16:12] <Deusdeorum> Cork ah, i see, thanks! It's a hidden input though..
[03:17:35] <Cork> Deusdeorum: you can do it like $('.input-class').val(function(i, val) { return val + 'whatever'; });
[03:17:44] <Cork> Deusdeorum: as the selector can match more then one element
[03:17:45] <Deusdeorum> Cork Nice!
[04:26:32] <zero> hello everyone
[04:27:09] <Guest29210> is there anyone here that understands jplayer, mediaelement that I could ask a question?
[04:33:50] <Cork> Guest29210: don't ask for ppl when you ask questions on irc, ask the question so ppl can see if they can answer it, else you are likely to have to wait for a very long time
[04:39:47] <Guest29210> ok sorry , here is my full question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46032367/jplayer-connected-bind-to-mediaelement
[04:55:26] <tayzee> hi all, im wondering if anyone can help me out, i have a site which i have put together in wordpress. Hi There,   I have an issue with the map that I am loading on my page. The first time i load the website and navigate to the contact us page, the map will load. If i navigate away from the contact us page and then back again, the map wont load. Reloading the page will load the map again.
[04:56:09] <tayzee> i believe this is due to the theme that i am using loading the pages on my site using javscript/jquery..
[04:56:37] <tayzee> if someone could help me fix my problem, id be very appreciative!
[04:56:39] <localh0st> tayzee: my magic ball is broken today
[04:57:57] <tayzee> how about your elite skills?
[05:03:29] <Guest29210> link your site
[05:04:42] <tayzee> tespauruth.co.za
[05:06:16] <localh0st> tayzee: first of all, fix your js errors, there is a lot of them
[05:06:36] <localh0st> mapsvg.min.js?ver=8.0.1:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[05:07:06] <tayzee> im not sure how to.. i think they are all stemming from the map though?
[05:10:27] <Guest29210> check Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[05:12:14] <Guest29210> plugins/mapsvg-lite-interactive-vector-maps/js/mapsvg.min.js?ver=8.0.1
[05:25:11] <tayzee> @Guest29210, im looking in the file, but not sure how to fix that error, have browsed numerous stackoverflow questions with similar issues
[05:25:29] <tayzee> however, this error isnt related to my issue..
[05:42:55] <ph88> hey guys i try to get event delegation working, i have this html and js code (at the bottom)  https://bpaste.net/show/a88063cab4b7  when i run those selectors separately they work .. but the click event is not working  what am i doing wrong ?
[05:45:15] <ph88> this doesn't work either ..  $('#testListForm').on('click', '#testListForm_combinations_0_remove_combination', function(e) {
[05:46:54] <tayzee> @Guest29210, @localh0st - those javascript errors are only happening now if i navigate away from the contact us page and then back.. if i refresh the page they dont happen anymore.
[05:49:31] <ph88> oh i got it, was editing the wrong file -___-
[06:25:58] <dejavou42> When on click executes in a test site that I'm working on, I get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'slideToggle' of null." Here is the JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/e313jtpo/
[06:27:51] <localh0st> dejavou42: surround your js with document.ready
[06:28:55] <localh0st> tayzee: still, this is some kind of error, you can't go forward without fixing it.
[06:31:08] <Guest29210> can anyone help me with this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46032367/jplayer-connected-bind-to-mediaelement
[06:31:12] <dejavou42> https://jsfiddle.net/e313jtpo/1/
[06:31:22] <dejavou42> like this?
[06:32:48] <Guest29210> hm
[06:32:58] <Guest29210> I will whisp yo
[06:33:00] <Guest29210> you
[06:34:56] <localh0st> dejavou42: like this, does it work now?
[06:36:53] <dejavou42> localh0st: nope :(  still get the same error
[06:39:36] <localh0st> dejavou42: on your test site, what does console return to you on: console.log($("#menu-trigger")); ?
[06:42:42] <dejavou42> null
[06:44:28] <localh0st> so you don't have such element in DOM, check the creation of it
[06:45:04] <dejavou42> I believe I did that right... I nested that code underneath the onclick function like this: https://jsfiddle.net/e313jtpo/2/
[06:52:29] <dejavou42> hmm ok. so, I know the element is being created, as the menu button that I am clicking would not appear if it wasn't, but it is as if the JS is not aware of that element
[06:53:18] <dejavou42> that and I can actually inspect the element, "<div id="menu-trigger">Menu</div>"
[06:58:28] <Cork> dejavou42: you should never get that error if $ is jquery
[06:58:40] <Cork> cause $() doesn't ever return nul
[06:58:42] <Cork> +l
[07:02:02] <dejavou42> prior to defining the jquery script, I have loaded the jquery <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script>.. yes I know the jquery version is much older, but I was going to try to get the script working on the test site, and then re-write it for 3.2.1
[07:03:24] <Cork> dejavou42: try using jQuery() instead of $()
[07:03:33] <Cork> that might get you around the problem
[07:03:48] <Cork> like so https://jsfiddle.net/e313jtpo/3/
[07:04:12] <Cork> if something you include after jquery is taking the $ variable you could get the problem you see
[07:08:03] <dejavou42> https://jsfiddle.net/e313jtpo/4/ <-- I updated the script like this, now the prepended <div id="menu-trigger"> Menu </div> doesn't appear in either the JSfiddle or the test site
[07:09:12] <Cork> dejavou42: you missed the $ in the first line
[07:09:48] <Cork> and it is jQuery not JQuery
[07:18:39] <dejavou42> https://jsfiddle.net/e313jtpo/6/ ?
[07:23:09] <dejavou42> that still gives an error pointing back to null #menu-trigger
[07:32:55] <Cork> you need to use the first line i gave you
[07:33:13] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/e313jtpo/7/
[07:37:18] <dejavou42> Cork: it worked!!!
[07:37:32] <Cork> dejavou42: so you have another script in the page taking over $
[07:37:36] <Cork> that is why things fails
[07:38:04] <Cork> jQuery(function($) {}) redefines so $ is jQuery inside the function
[07:38:21] <Cork> and that is why the problem is avoided through it
[07:39:18] <dejavou42> I need to familiarize myself with jquery/js syntax
[07:39:46] <Cork> $(function() {}) is just a function call passing an anonymous function to it
[07:40:16] <Cork> function myFunction(callback) { callback(variable); } myFunction(function($) {});
[07:40:27] <Cork> that is basically what you have up there
[07:43:00] <dejavou42> got it. I got it. I was thinking of jquery as a language vs thinking of it as a library of the JS language
[07:43:17] <Cork> ah, jquery isn't a language, just a framework
[07:44:46] <dejavou42> Thanks for the help Cork
[07:44:51] <Cork> np
[07:55:56] <tayzee> localh0st: I believe this problem is occurring due to the way this wordpress theme loads the pages on my site.. its loading the map config on every page but the actual map div is only on the contact us page
[10:04:38] <dimi1947> take a look at the code here:https://hastebin.com/hejitigeci.js the first line is executed on document loading while the line beneath it after an ajax request...the question if the second line is going to have any affect at all...since the first pre-exists
[10:05:53] <Cork> dimi1947: it depends on how long it takes for each to run
[10:06:27] <dimi1947> Cork:I do not understand...can you elaborate?
[10:06:28] <Cork> if you by page load mean the onload event it can depend on a <video> downloading, while the ajax call might be a header "ok" response
[10:06:41] <Cork> in that case the ajax call would complete first
[10:07:19] <dimi1947> Cork:no the first line definitely runs first...
[10:07:41] <dimi1947> assuming the above is the second line going to have any effect?
[10:08:00] <Cork> impossible to say as there is no html
[10:09:33] <dimi1947> Cork:I am going to tell you what strange happens..give me a second to show you the html
[10:15:30] <toothfairy_> Hi, I am experiencing a problem ... I am using some js to load content into an iframe when clicking a link. Problem is, most times it loads in the iframe, but sometimes for some reason it opens up the iframe in an entirely new page with iframe content only, and I don't understand why. Its supposed to load within the iframe at the current page only.  https://dpaste.de/r6eB
[10:15:33] <dimi1947> Cork: take a look at the HTML...the strange is that the hide class appears in the markup but its effect in the element(fieldset) is not applied(as you guess this happens after the ajax call runs)
[10:15:38] <dimi1947> https://hastebin.com/ananiredaf.js
[10:17:13] <dimi1947> it seems that the first line has precedence
[10:17:20] <dandar> Hi guys, I'm having some troubles using jquery sectors on an iframe. If i get the contents by calling $('#myiframe').contents() and then I make some queries by using method selectors, it doesn't retrieve nothing and considers an empty selector (""), while if I use a textual selector it works as expected. Does anyone know why?
[11:03:48] <EriC^^> hi, if i have var divid=something; and i want to do var stuff=$('#divid').html(); how can i do that?
[11:04:11] <EriC^^> how do i use a variable with $('<variable here>') ?
[11:04:55] <shoky> EriC^^: you pass a string selector to $(...)   just add '#' at the beginning..
[11:05:15] <EriC^^> shoky: what's a string selector?
[11:05:45] <shoky> EriC^^:  it's a string that is a jquery selector, like '#divid'.  it's just a string.  you can concatenate 2 strings to make that string
[11:05:56] <shoky> and if you don't know how to concatenate strings, you need to learn JS :p
[11:06:10] <EriC^^> yeah i dont know much JS
[11:06:26] <shoky> str1 + str2   concatenates them into one string
[11:07:18] <EriC^^> so i need to do var divid="#" + something; then do $(divid).html() ?
[11:07:47] <shoky> that'd work, though you don't need the '#' in divid itself,  only in what you actually pass to $()
[11:09:07] <EriC^^> shoky: alright, thanks, i'll give it a go!
[11:13:27] <EriC^^> shoky: works like a charm, thanks!
[11:17:09] <shoky> np
[11:18:41] <EriC^^> i have another question, i'm trying to send the contents of a div, to a add.php page, to do something with it, when i add the ajax post code, it just doesn't do anything
[11:19:13] <EriC^^> i put the ajax and php page here, thanks http://paste.ubuntu.com/25465727/
[11:33:21] <EriC^^> got it working, nevermind
[11:42:43] <EriC^^> does anyone know something i could use for a search Next and previous function similar to this? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wikunia/Ctrl-f.js/master/JS/search.js
[11:43:35] <EriC^^> this one highlights all the text on the screen, i'd like to add to it to jump to every word with a next and previous button, any pointers appreciated
[11:48:19] <Mrgoose2> Why's everyone leaving jquery :(
[12:10:36] <drej> Mrgoose2: because its not really relevant any more
[12:10:39] <drej> such is life
[12:17:11] <EriC^^> what took its place if you dont mind me asking?
[13:21:27] <toothfairy_> Hi, I am experiencing a problem ... I am using some js to load content into an iframe when clicking a link. Problem is, most times it loads in the iframe, but sometimes for some reason it opens up the iframe in an entirely new page with iframe content only, and I don't understand why. Its supposed to load within the iframe at the current page only.  https://dpaste.de/r6eB
[13:23:54] <dimi1947> Suppose I use the HTML panel of dev tools and add a class in an element(manually-by editing the code).Is this going to take precedence over whatever code(parsed) is the JS file?
[13:33:28] <momomo> is there an unexpensive way for jquery to return an appropiate selector for an $(element)  ?
[13:33:39] <robertmaxrees> "return an appropriate selector"?
[13:34:32] <robertmaxrees> momomo could you clarify what you're trying to do?
[13:35:20] <momomo> robertmaxrees: i am passing an element to a function which is spitting out css .. i would like to match that element without adding attributes if possible, but I am guessing i am asking for too much ... they should include in the wrc spec an element unique identifier that is assigned when the element is inserted
[13:35:23] <momomo> into the dom
[13:35:38] <momomo> and can be targeted using css .. aside  from id=''
[13:35:47] <robertmaxrees> mind showing a fiddle?
[13:35:53] <robertmaxrees> i think I get what you're trying to do.
[13:35:58] <robertmaxrees> but I wanna be sure :)
[13:40:05] <momomo> robertmaxrees: just a bit of pseudo .. to much effort  to style and append for real
[13:40:05] <momomo> https://jsfiddle.net/k49h6h1w/
[13:40:22] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:40:41] <robertmaxrees> soooo why are you generating css in the first place?
[13:42:56] <momomo> robertmaxrees: you think css only is enough in this world?
[13:43:11] <anki> Hello All,
[13:43:11] <anki> I have one query is it possible to close text area which has been opened on click using textarea id ?
[13:43:12] <momomo> many times you need to calculate stuff to get proper animations
[13:43:13] <robertmaxrees> it's a simple enough question.
[13:43:21] <robertmaxrees> momomo erm, not really.
[13:43:22] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[13:43:27] <robertmaxrees> either way, you can do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k49h6h1w/1/
[13:43:44] <robertmaxrees> anki come again?  gotta fiddle, maybe?
[13:44:17] <momomo> robertmaxrees: what do you mean not really? ofcourse you do, there's plenty of examples where you need info that's not possible to get in a static css file
[13:44:24] <robertmaxrees> monokrome
[13:44:27] <robertmaxrees> err, woops.
[13:44:28] <anki> Sorry ,I though it may be easy task didn't create fiddle for it
[13:44:45] <robertmaxrees> momomo i have never needed to calculate things dynamically like that before.
[13:44:49] <robertmaxrees> moei
[13:44:54] <robertmaxrees> wtf i can't type today hahaha
[13:45:18] <momomo> robertmaxrees: i can give you an example right now .. i have an element positioned absolute in the middle of the screen
[13:45:24] <momomo> it is of unknown hight
[13:45:37] <Mrgoose2> what do you all have against long polling
[13:45:39] <momomo> i need to translate it out of the window just so it is outside
[13:45:48] <robertmaxrees> why not fixed positioning?
[13:46:03] <robertmaxrees> momomo either way, i posted a solution using .css() :)
[13:46:08] <momomo> doesn't really matter in this case
[13:46:13] <robertmaxrees> sure it does.
[13:46:18] <robertmaxrees> you want to fly it out of the screen, right?>
[13:46:24] <momomo> robertmaxrees: i am using keyframes
[13:46:26] <momomo> :p
[13:46:34] <momomo> yes,
[13:46:46] <momomo> translateY(100%) doesn't work because 100% is relative to the element height
[13:46:51] <momomo> so that doesn't work
[13:47:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up #css.
[13:47:20] <momomo> translateY(-50vh) doesn't work because you need to account for the element height
[13:47:27] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:47:33] <robertmaxrees> your realize there's a calc(), right?
[13:47:35] <momomo> i  can overcompensate or maybe use calc
[13:47:47] <robertmaxrees> you can automatically compensate with the element height,.
[13:47:55] <momomo> but there are cases where calc will fail to know the height of the element
[13:48:05] <momomo> robertmaxrees: and i can compensate
[13:48:07] <robertmaxrees> sounds like bad css to me then heh
[13:48:13] <robertmaxrees> but you're not gonna believe me soooo.
[13:48:14] <momomo> but that would not be the perfect solutin
[13:49:02] <momomo> robertmaxrees: it's actually not that bad to generate the css on the fly anyway .. actually it's better .. you have the entire environment available
[13:49:07] <robertmaxrees> actually.
[13:49:14] <robertmaxrees> it IS pretty bad heh.
[13:49:17] <momomo> i will just be generating an id if non exists
[13:49:36] <robertmaxrees> you lose out on some optimizations.  and some browsers won't work properly at all.
[13:49:44] <momomo> robertmaxrees: why? give me on reason, and don't say performance, because i haven't noticed any of that .. not even on mobile
[13:49:55] <momomo> robertmaxrees: they work here
[13:50:05] <robertmaxrees> you care about older version of IE at all?
[13:50:10] <momomo> not really
[13:50:16] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) your choice then.
[13:50:16] <momomo> does anyone anymore?
[13:50:18] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[13:50:33] <momomo> doing so you have to sacrifice too much
[13:51:00] <robertmaxrees> agree to disagree :)
[13:51:18] <robertmaxrees> momomo we have plenty of users who still purchase from us using older IE.
[13:51:19] <robertmaxrees> sooooo
[13:52:38] <robertmaxrees> not saying that's the right choice for everybody, just something to consider.
[13:52:39] <momomo> robertmaxrees: i am guessing you use animations? or translate then?
[13:52:51] <momomo> transform, or any of that?
[13:53:00] <momomo> i am guessing not.. i choose to use those
[13:53:04] <robertmaxrees> for those users, we focus on pure functionality.
[13:53:13] <robertmaxrees> we gracefully degrade and just don'
[13:53:18] <robertmaxrees> *don't use the animations.
[13:54:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest maybe hitting up #css and seeing if they have any suggestions for your particular case.
[13:55:59] <momomo> robertmaxrees: no, i don't think so ... i guess generating id's if there are none will have to do.
[13:56:23] <robertmaxrees> but you just need a reference to the element.
[13:56:26] <robertmaxrees> why do you need an ID?
[13:56:46] <momomo> robertmaxrees: isn't that the most effecient way?
[13:56:57] <robertmaxrees> back WAY up.
[13:57:00] <momomo> id is probably better than an attribute selector ...
[13:57:03] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:57:07] <momomo> or what?
[13:57:15] <robertmaxrees> did you look at my fiddle?
[13:57:58] <momomo> robertmaxrees: yes, you style it directly i am guessing
[13:58:00] <robertmaxrees> also: 2 things: 1 - you said that my concerns over your approach shouldn't include performance heh.  2 - you were already looking at selecting the element in the first place./
[13:58:05] <momomo> you can't really do that with animations
[13:58:09] <momomo> or i mean keyframes
[13:58:12] <momomo> declare them on the fly
[13:58:15] <momomo> like that
[13:58:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:58:22] <robertmaxrees> good luck then duder.
[13:58:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd HIGHLY suggest hitting up #css :)
[13:59:06] <momomo> robertmaxrees: don't be patronizing .. i am probably more skilled than you are .. just here asking for a question i already knew there was no answer to because I just like to complain .. so it's out there
[13:59:09] <momomo> lol
[13:59:34] <momomo> robertmaxrees: here, just for you, so you see how I actually create my animations: https://hastebin.com/olewerihed.php
[14:01:19] <robertmaxrees> there's no reason to get insulting duder.
[14:01:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm not being patronizing.
[14:02:20] <momomo> I am SOOOOOOOO sorry
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> chill out, yo.
[14:02:35] <momomo> robertmaxrees: sorry for real, you seem nice
[14:02:43] <robertmaxrees> good luck mano
[14:02:51] <momomo> chest bump
[14:29:12] <robertmaxrees> momomo no need to PM me duder.
[14:29:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:48:55] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[14:49:37] <randymarsh9> i'm trying to disable clicking on elements of a certain class while i do some processing, then re-enable it after it's done
[14:50:05] <randymarsh9> is $(selector).click(false/true); the way to go or something else?
[14:51:00] <randymarsh9> i'm trying it but doing .click(true) doesn't make the click work again so i'm wondering if i should use something different
[14:54:36] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 depends on some factors :) are you doing an ajax call or something?
[14:56:11] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: animation
[14:56:49] <robertmaxrees> Ah.  i'd maybe use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[14:56:55] <robertmaxrees> and set it to none; on the element.
[14:58:29] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: good call
[14:58:34] <randymarsh9> so something like this?
[14:58:36] <randymarsh9> $(selector).css({"pointer-events": "none"});
[15:01:02] <robertmaxrees> you can omit the curlies if it's just one property.
[15:01:05] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[15:02:25] <randymarsh9> pff that's right good catch
[15:03:22] <randymarsh9> when i re-enable do i want to use "all" or "auto"?
[15:05:10] <robertmaxrees> look at the docs :)
[15:05:15] <robertmaxrees> all is for svg only.
[15:05:22] <robertmaxrees> auto or initial both work for what you want.
[15:09:46] <randymarsh9> yea it was literally right the first line in the next table *facepalm*
[15:10:01] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: thank you!!
[15:10:42] <randymarsh9> this works great, you don't want to hear what convoluted error handling i was coming up with to deal with this when i can just disable clicking lol
[15:11:59] <Al_nz1> why is my clone button not working : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/36729/
[15:15:12] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: out of curiosity do you use chrome or firefox
[15:19:22] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 FF dev
[15:21:56] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/DTcHh/36733/
[15:22:13] <robertmaxrees> you have no element with the ID personcontainer
[15:22:22] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: i should try that. using regular FF now but the more i test things in chrome i feel like it just renders jquery animation and such better
[15:22:34] <randymarsh9> was thinking of jumping to chrome tbh
[15:23:06] <randymarsh9> been using ff for like 15 years now
[15:23:18] <robertmaxrees> with the new e10s setup from ff it's been performing better.
[15:23:23] <robertmaxrees> i just like the dev tools more.
[15:23:28] <robertmaxrees> though chrome's are plenty great, too.
[15:23:51] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 you see my edit?
[15:27:14] <randymarsh9> that's a good point, i'm used to the debugger/etc so maybe i'll just continue coding in FF but write for chrome :)
[15:27:50] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 erm.
[15:27:58] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: snap - I fixed it too
[15:27:59] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/36737/
[15:28:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd write for whatever your users are using,.
[15:28:22] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 fwiw that's going to keep giving you an invalid page.
[15:28:36] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: now that the fiddle is going, I can get to the real question - looks like I need to use event delegation to get a cloned button to work?
[15:28:48] <Al_nz1> see updated  : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/36737/
[15:29:13] <robertmaxrees> already there.
[15:29:14] <robertmaxrees> and yes.
[15:29:23] <robertmaxrees> but you also need to fix your duplicate ID problem.
[15:31:16] <Al_nz1> when I am cloning, its ending up cloning id="person_template" ?
[15:31:35] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:31:47] <Al_nz1> ok - I can do that.
[15:31:48] <robertmaxrees> you're cloning the entire element.
[15:31:52] <robertmaxrees> IDs, classes, and all.
[15:32:14] <robertmaxrees> also:
[15:32:33] <robertmaxrees> $(newPerson) - stop doing this
[15:32:35] <Al_nz1> i think person_template is the only id in there, but I will remove it using the button
[15:32:53] <Al_nz1> just newPerson right
[15:32:54] <robertmaxrees> no reason to pass a jquery object back through jquery.
[15:33:37] <Al_nz1> just use newPerson right?
[15:33:54] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:33:57] <robertmaxrees> what else would it be?
[15:33:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:34:25] <Al_nz1> so, back to this event delegation for the button : http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:34:38] <robertmaxrees> what's the question?
[15:34:40] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: most users are on chrome
[15:34:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:34:54] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 on your site?
[15:35:08] <randymarsh9> yea
[15:35:10] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 because the important part is the demographic hitting your site.
[15:35:24] <robertmaxrees> and don't forget the bang for the buck on other browsers,.
[15:35:45] <randymarsh9> i figured it doesn't just apply to my site though
[15:35:57] <robertmaxrees> chrome does have a tremendous amount of market share.
[15:36:07] <robertmaxrees> but our site has a lot of other browsers, as well.
[15:36:07] <Al_nz1> well the example on the jquery docs is using $(selector).on("click",.....but I am using $(selector).click(function(.... is there a way to use event delegation with the syntax I am using (.click)
[15:36:16] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 nope.
[15:36:20] <robertmaxrees> need to use .on()
[15:36:43] <robertmaxrees> .click(function() {}) is just shorthand for .on('click', function() {});
[15:38:10] <Al_nz1> right, and so the second parameter is going to be "button" ?
[15:38:19] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:38:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:38:47] <Al_nz1> $( '.btnGetPerson').on("click", "button", function() { ?
[15:38:52] <robertmaxrees> so if you read the docs, you'll see that $(selector) needs to point to an ancestor that exists at the time of binding for all future buttons
[15:39:12] <robertmaxrees> because, as the docs point out, you're going to listen on that ancestor for any events from children that bubble up.
[15:39:39] <robertmaxrees> the docs discuss the problem, which is that $(selector).on can only bind to elements that exist when its run
[15:40:24] <Al_nz1> you mean bind it to : <div class="panel panel-default hidden"  id="person_template"> ?
[15:40:25] <robertmaxrees> so instead, like the docs show you, you'll do $('someAncestorForAllThoseNwElements').on('click', 'theSelectorFromTheButton', function() {});
[15:40:29] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:40:40] <robertmaxrees> i mean for an ancestor that exists for all elements now and forever.
[15:41:35] <Al_nz1> so a parent that contains the cloned elements, and the original element set?
[15:41:50] <jq> Hey, so if I have a few things with the selector $(".test"), then have a $("test").click function, and with ajax add another $(".test") object, the click function doesn't fire on the newly added one. Is there a workaround for this? (sorry if this is a stupid way to explain and it doesn't make sense)
[15:41:55] <robertmaxrees> whatever will have the bnutton you care about.
[15:42:07] <robertmaxrees> jq you need to use event delegation
[15:42:08] <Al_nz1> thats just about the whole page
[15:42:19] <jq> robertmaxrees: What does that mean o.O
[15:42:20] <robertmaxrees> jq http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:42:24] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:42:28] <jq> Thank you, I'll check it out
[15:42:29] <robertmaxrees> ^ these both explain it.
[15:42:36] <Al_nz1> jq: Im on the same topic....
[15:42:51] <jq> Lol
[15:42:52] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 soooo you'll need to find an element that you can bind to.
[15:43:03] <jq> Oh so just an .on event instdad of .click and problem solved?
[15:43:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:43:15] <jq> Oh lemme read again lol
[15:43:43] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/sZi1aIF.png
[15:43:54] <robertmaxrees> the first example is the "don't do this"
[15:43:56] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: in terms of the fiddle isnt it : <div id="supplementary" class="tab-pane fade in"> ?
[15:43:57] <robertmaxrees> the second is the "do this"
[15:44:20] <Al_nz1> since that contains both people inputs (and buttons)
[15:44:50] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 i dunno - have you tried?
[15:44:50] <jq> I'm not following o.O
[15:44:59] <robertmaxrees> jq where are you getting lost?
[15:45:17] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/lGsW3OG.png
[15:45:32] <jq> I understand the difference in that use case
[15:45:46] <jq> But I'm not dealing with sub class of sub class etc
[15:45:50] <jq> I just have .test
[15:45:58] <jq> So I don't understand how that applies
[15:46:00] <robertmaxrees> what's the element .test is getting appended to?
[15:46:19] <jq> OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[15:46:22] <jq> I get it
[15:46:23] <jq> Lol
[15:46:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:47:26] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aL9zdnh9/
[15:47:34] <robertmaxrees> for the compressed version.
[15:47:40] <Al_nz1> bugger - now my cloning button stoped working.
[15:47:40] <jq> Sweeeeeeeeet it works
[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> aces
[15:47:55] <jq> You're the best ;)
[15:47:57] <jq> Thanks bro
[15:49:47] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 get it working?
[15:49:54] <Al_nz1> working on it
[15:50:13] <Al_nz1> yip :-)
[15:50:26] <Al_nz1> sweet :-)
[15:50:31] <Al_nz1> thanks
[15:51:17] <jq> Multi file uploaders suck and I hate coding them
[15:51:19] <jq> That is all
[15:51:27] <jq> Just an announcement of my hate
[15:56:04] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: unless there is some reason why I shouldnt I am going to make a seperate handler to listen for the cloned on clicks - otherwise I would end up passing just about the whole DOM in?
[15:56:09] <Al_nz1> or is that ok?
[15:56:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:56:33] <robertmaxrees> you mean binding a new handler for each button?
[15:56:55] <Al_nz1> no - one handler for the original button, and one handler for all cloned buttons
[15:57:03] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:57:56] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:58:00] <Al_nz1> the source button, and the cloned ones are on seperate tabs
[15:58:18] <robertmaxrees> aren't you appending to personcontainer?
[15:58:35] <robertmaxrees> update the fidddle pls.
[15:58:38] <Al_nz1> the fiddle was simplified
[15:58:49] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:59:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm super lost.
[15:59:11] <robertmaxrees> are you not appending them all to personcontainer ?
[16:00:05] <Al_nz1> looking....
[16:00:34] <jq> Can I have a dynamic variable name? Like 'var imavariable = "hello"; var imavariable = "test"; ' so then in the end I have a variable nammed "hello"?Lol
[16:00:58] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:01:06] <jq> Lol I'm so bad at explaining shit
[16:01:10] <jq> Lemme try to fiddle what I mean
[16:01:11] <robertmaxrees> show what you mean.
[16:01:15] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ :)
[16:01:54] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: all the cloned ones go into the personcontainer - yes, but there is another set of those buttons outside that personcontainer
[16:01:59] <jq> Wait, this makes no sense
[16:02:01] <jq> Lol
[16:02:19] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 so you have two sets of buttons?
[16:02:26] <robertmaxrees> but they do the same thing?
[16:02:37] <jq> If I have 2 ajax uploads going, how can I have a cancel button for each one
[16:02:38] <jq> Hrmmm
[16:02:47] <jq> I don't know how to target the right one to cancel
[16:03:43] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1
[16:04:17] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 'cause you can do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aL9zdnh9/2/
[16:04:20] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: the button is to lookup a person in that group
[16:04:28] <Al_nz1> is to populate that set of fields
[16:04:31] <Al_nz1> ie
[16:04:41] <robertmaxrees> so the two groups have buttons that do different things?
[16:05:51] <jq> So if I have 2 ajax file uploads going, and I want to cancel one of them, how do I do so? I know .abort will cancel, but what selector do I use to select the one I want to run abort on
[16:06:04] <jq> Dude I'm so bad at explaining, wow
[16:06:28] <robertmaxrees> jq so you have a flaw in yoru loigic :)
[16:06:32] <robertmaxrees> *logic
[16:06:39] <jq> I don't think so
[16:06:41] <robertmaxrees> in that ajax calls aren't necessarily tied to elements.
[16:06:46] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: each set of person fields has its own button to lookup a person - each time those fields are cloned a corresponding button is cloned with it
[16:06:56] <jq> Well Yeah my wording wasn't right
[16:07:10] <jq> But, 2 ajax uploads going, how to I say lets cancel the 2nd one
[16:07:47] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/446626/923919
[16:08:09] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 so the two sets of buttosn have the same action?
[16:08:19] <robertmaxrees> jq you'll have to pop them into an array and go from, there.
[16:08:23] <jq> robertmaxrees: That's to abort 1, because note that it has one variable
[16:08:30] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[16:08:45] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to poke around the object to see if you can't find info about the specific request./
[16:08:45] <jq> Yeah I don't get how to do mor ethan one?
[16:09:07] <jq> Well more than one thing cant have the same variable
[16:09:12] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:09:12] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:09:13] <jq> So wouldn't 1 overwrite the other?
[16:09:14] <robertmaxrees> hence the array.,
[16:09:24] <robertmaxrees> var someArray = []; var anAjaxCall = $.ajax({}); someArray.push(anAjaxCall);
[16:09:38] <jq> Oh that sounds annoying
[16:09:38] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to find a way to do cleanup in the .then() of the ajax calls.
[16:09:41] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:09:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't have a reference to look back to otherwise./
[16:10:08] <jq> If only I could just make a dynamic variable
[16:10:11] <jq> -_-
[16:10:20] <robertmaxrees> "dynamic variable" doesn't make sense heh.
[16:10:24] <jq> Yes
[16:10:25] <robertmaxrees> nor does that solve your problem.
[16:10:25] <jq> A name
[16:10:38] <jq> If I could create a variable using the file name thats being uploaded
[16:10:51] <jq> Then access iut by whatever.abort() assuming whatever is the filename that I made a variable with
[16:10:54] <jq> Get it?
[16:10:57] <robertmaxrees> erm, you can do that basically witht he idea i just toissed out.
[16:11:22] <jq> Yeah, but I guess in this case it's just giving it a name in an array
[16:11:23] <jq> But yeah
[16:11:26] <jq> I hate arrays
[16:11:27] <jq> That's all
[16:11:29] <robertmaxrees> why??
[16:11:40] <jq> Idk, I'm a weirdo
[16:11:44] <robertmaxrees> arrays are greatr.
[16:11:50] <robertmaxrees> *great
[16:11:54] <jq> They make me have to think too hard
[16:11:57] <robertmaxrees> and super easy to work with in this case.
[16:12:01] <jq> I think it's really that I just hate javascript
[16:12:05] <jq> lol
[16:12:09] <jq> I'm a php guy
[16:12:16] <jq> Forced to do front end stuff right now
[16:12:17] <jq> Lol
[16:13:23] <robertmaxrees> it's really not that bad.
[16:13:24] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[16:15:40] <aFeijo> hi folks
[16:16:27] <aFeijo> I need to do a simple play from a <audio> tag, I'm using $('audio').play; but naturally jQuery doesnt have it, it seems I could do it with this.play, but in an each(function()) it didnt work too. What am I missing?
[16:17:00] <robertmaxrees> aFeijo show us what you mean.
[16:17:14] <robertmaxrees> jq https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lftjhmpz/1/
[16:17:18] <robertmaxrees> super hacky but you get the idea.
[16:17:21] <robertmaxrees> also untested.
[16:17:39] <jq> I actually got something else wortking
[16:17:44] <robertmaxrees> but this gives you an array of ajax calls.  can use the fileName on the button to match up with the name in the a3rray.
[16:17:49] <robertmaxrees> boom, problem solved.
[16:17:50] <jq> Lemme see if I can explain
[16:17:59] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: something else not quite right - let me try to update that fiddle.....
[16:18:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:18:20] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 you don't still have duplicate ids, do you?
[16:18:41] <jq> So var uploadsArray = []; - then var request = ajax(blahblahblah); then uploadsArray[thefilename] = request. then when the upload finishes I do delete uploadsArray[thefilename]
[16:18:43] <jq> Make ense?
[16:18:53] <robertmaxrees> so
[16:18:55] <robertmaxrees> first fof.
[16:18:58] <robertmaxrees> you're depla*off
[16:19:00] <jq> This way I can always uploadsArray[thefilename].abort()
[16:19:01] <robertmaxrees> wtf hahaha
[16:19:07] <robertmaxrees> except you're not using an array there.
[16:19:15] <robertmaxrees> you're declaring one and then putting properties on it.
[16:19:22] <robertmaxrees> also: you should avoid delete.
[16:19:32] <jq> What do you mean?
[16:19:46] <robertmaxrees> javascript doesn't have associative arrays.
[16:19:48] <robertmaxrees> just normal arrays.
[16:20:01] <robertmaxrees> so you're doing  var uploadsArray = [];  and then not using it like an array.,
[16:20:13] <jq> But if I console.log uploadsArray after, it's definitely an array
[16:20:21] <robertmaxrees> right, because everything in JS is an object.
[16:20:27] <robertmaxrees> so you can put properties on them.
[16:20:40] <jq> So forgetting the array definition in the beginning
[16:20:44] <jq> Can I just do it like I'm doing it?
[16:20:47] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't./
[16:20:48] <jq> Or is it bad
[16:20:57] <jq> Why though?
[16:21:02] <jq> Also, whats an alternative to delete?
[16:21:11] <robertmaxrees> i showed you the other way.
[16:22:51] <robertmaxrees> if you actually use the array, you can just .slice() the element out.
[16:23:02] <aFeijo> robertmaxrees, I will try to assemble a jsfiddle
[16:23:45] <jq> That fiddle seems like an unnecessary bunch of nonsense for something so simple, why is that a better way?
[16:23:46] <jq> o.O
[16:24:14] <jq> Not saying it is, just saying to me it looks like it so I'm curious why that's much better
[16:26:06] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: getting closer, the cloning works, the button works, but the dropdowns that are cloned are empty....
[16:29:20] <Al_nz1> its those "pretty" bootstrap dropdowns.....might need something special
[16:30:54] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: something to do with this maybe : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38878122/bootstrap-selectpicker-and-cloning
[16:31:36] <robertmaxrees> jq what happens when you have multiple ajax calls with the same filename?
[16:32:21] <jq> Ummmmmmmmmmm
[16:32:39] <jq> Why don't I use the filesize then
[16:32:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:32:51] <jq> Cause it's highly unlikely something is the exact same bytes
[16:32:53] <robertmaxrees> or you can just use an array (shrug)
[16:33:12] <jq> Lol but it is an array
[16:33:13] <robertmaxrees> that way you get the name you want, which makes debugging a little easier.
[16:33:26] <robertmaxrees> there's also some perf issues with delete
[16:33:30] <jq> I just need a JS developer
[16:33:32] <jq> Lol
[16:33:33] <robertmaxrees> but it looks like you're gonna go with your version.
[16:34:21] <jq> I'm trying to make something that works even if it's a little hacky just to have something that works and if the business model succeeds then I'll hire someone
[16:34:30] <jq> Lol
[16:34:37] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) it'll save you headaches down the road, but alright.
[16:34:41] <robertmaxrees> your call mano.
[16:35:21] <jq> Most of the magic in this site is stuff in the backend, the front end is very simple, took me a non front end person just about 2 days to make
[16:35:21] <jq> :P
[16:35:32] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: this looks like what I need : https://github.com/silviomoreto/bootstrap-select/issues/605
[16:35:38] <jq> So I could hire someone good to make a perfect non hacky version fairly quickly probabluy
[16:35:55] <robertmaxrees> you say you want to eventually hire a frontend guy, then get a frontend guy to give you advice, then reject it lol
[16:36:09] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 yeah, lots of bootstrap stuff doesn't work on cloned elements.
[16:36:33] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: looks like it *Can* work - but needs some fiddling
[16:37:15] <robertmaxrees> sure. though at that point I usually just get a templating engine and use that, then init on the new elements as necesary.
[16:39:01] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: they are saying to clone.find('.bootstrap-select').replaceWith(function() { return $('select', this); });
[16:39:15] <robertmaxrees> you can do that, too.
[16:39:20] <robertmaxrees> just tossing out ideas.
[16:40:28] <jq> robertmaxrees: Lol yeah when I don't have to touch the front end anymore I don't care what the code is
[16:40:38] <jq> But when I have to still go in and fix things I need to understand it
[16:40:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:40:43] <jq> And your way for this thing made no sense to me
[16:40:48] <robertmaxrees> do whatever works.
[16:40:48] <jq> Lol
[16:40:52] <robertmaxrees> just giving you ideas mang.
[16:41:10] <jq> In this case that's what I'm doing, my way works for now :P
[16:41:11] <robertmaxrees> dunno what's with the theme today of people asking for help, getting input, then searching google and rejecting it.
[16:41:14] <robertmaxrees> i'll never understand taht.
[16:41:33] <jq> Only for that one thing
[16:41:39] <jq> The other thing I listened to you :P
[16:41:42] <robertmaxrees> it's happened a few times today.
[16:41:43] <robertmaxrees> just weird.
[16:41:56] <jq> Ya know what I think it is
[16:42:05] <jq> I think it's that people come in here to ask a question and don't have it thought out yet
[16:42:17] <jq> Then in the process of asking it in question form, they now know how to google it right
[16:42:20] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really matter tbh.
[16:42:21] <robertmaxrees> just weird.
[16:42:54] <jq> Conversing helps the thought process
[16:42:59] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:43:06] <jq> I'm an idiot that usually solves my problems just because I asked the question
[16:43:07] <robertmaxrees> but why people keep asking for input and then rejecting it?
[16:43:09] <robertmaxrees> just strange.
[16:43:14] <robertmaxrees> sure, rubber duck debugging
[16:43:14] <jq> The act of formulating a question helped me solve it
[16:43:15] <jq> Lol
[16:43:24] <robertmaxrees> right, rubber duck debugging.
[16:43:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:43:35] <jq> Depends on the response you give
[16:43:42] <jq> In the first case it worked perfect and it's understandable
[16:43:46] <robertmaxrees> just kind of strange to ask for input, say "i'm not an expert", and then reject an expet's option.
[16:43:49] <jq> The 2nd thing is a little too advanced for me
[16:43:54] <robertmaxrees> *expert's
[16:43:55] <jq> And if theres a bug, I could never fix it
[16:43:56] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[16:43:59] <robertmaxrees> not really a big deal.
[16:44:06] <robertmaxrees> just funny.,
[16:44:11] <jq> You're looking over the reason over and over again as I explain
[16:44:18] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:44:19] <jq> Too complex of an answer is the issue
[16:44:32] <jq> If someone doesn't understand the code, they might not want to use it
[16:44:33] <robertmaxrees> excepot the answer *isn't* complex.
[16:44:38] <robertmaxrees> *except
[16:44:42] <jq> Your array answer is very complex looking to me
[16:44:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:45:04] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty basic stuff tho.  but like i said, it's not a big dealk.
[16:45:07] <robertmaxrees> just funny to me.
[16:45:16] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/N663T/20/ <- this fiddle does it. I tried to add lines 18 and 19 after my append?
[16:45:30] <jq> To you it's basic, to someone that does JS when they dont' wanna spend money on a brand new startup, it's complex
[16:45:40] <jq> Lol
[16:45:54] <jq> You'd cringe if you looked at my .js file right now :)
[16:46:11] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 i'm getting console errors in that fiddle.
[16:46:17] <jq> 318 lines that you. could probably code all in 100 lol
[16:46:25] <robertmaxrees> nah, i don't go for terse.
[16:46:28] <robertmaxrees> i go for readable.
[16:46:40] <robertmaxrees> either way, I always try to reason around stuff like that.
[16:46:58] <jq> Plus I'm one of those horrible people that write my js like it's php with my indenting and new line choices
[16:46:59] <jq> Lol
[16:47:11] <jq> Nothing bothers me more than } else { being on the same line
[16:47:12] <jq> Ughhh
[16:47:33] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: line 18 I take it find that class and removes it?
[16:47:52] <robertmaxrees> what else would it do?
[16:48:01] <Al_nz1> line 19? finds any select classes and adds the selectpicker function?
[16:48:45] <robertmaxrees> step through it.  think about what those method calls do.
[16:48:54] <aFeijo> robertmaxrees, I figured it out, this is what I need: $('audio').get(0).play();
[16:49:13] <robertmaxrees> aFeijo thought it might be that.
[16:49:26] <robertmaxrees> aFeijo jquery objects don't transparently pass through native dom method calls.
[16:49:42] <robertmaxrees> though you made a remark about using each() that threw me off
[16:49:53] <aFeijo> robertmaxrees, you could mention that before!! lol, thanks tho
[16:49:54] <robertmaxrees> glad you got it figured out though :)
[16:50:00] <jq> Ya know what else I hate about JS
[16:50:13] <aFeijo> its hard for me to translate my thoughts to my language, even worse to english
[16:50:14] <aFeijo> lkol
[16:50:17] <jq> Getting pinged in ##javascript by people talking about jquery by calling it JQ
[16:50:18] <jq> -_-
[16:50:28] <robertmaxrees> aFeijo heh, hard for me to know what to suggest when i'm confused by the question ;)
[16:50:41] <aFeijo> I needed to ask "how to get an jQuery selector element and access its native dom methods"
[16:50:52] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.
[16:51:00] <aFeijo> native dom was the key!
[16:51:20] <aFeijo> making a site that records audio, fun shit, but can be irritating
[16:51:28] <robertmaxrees> aye
[16:51:37] <aFeijo> now the worse one... How to post the recorded (blob) audio? and save to my server
[16:51:50] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: well I added those two lines which removes all my cloned select pickers entirely! lol
[16:52:05] <aFeijo> this doesnt work:       var form = new FormData(); form.append('file', chunks, 'cabine.mp3');
[16:53:00] <robertmaxrees> aFeijo you'll have better luck in ##javascript for that one.
[16:53:12] <aFeijo> yeah make sense, thanks!
[16:54:20] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: what does .find('select') actually select? I see there is no . or # ?
[16:54:36] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 erm.
[16:54:44] <robertmaxrees> the same thing it would select with $()
[16:55:00] <Al_nz1> <select> tags?
[16:55:01] <robertmaxrees> just as descendents of a given element
[16:55:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[16:55:29] <Al_nz1> hmm, well the code is removing all the select dropdowns entirely, and they are not getting put back
[16:55:43] <robertmaxrees> show the code again?
[16:55:53] <robertmaxrees> that you're using.
[16:57:15] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: in this fiddle (not mine) http://jsfiddle.net/N663T/20/ why are they targeting bootstrap-select - that class doesnt exist?
[16:57:28] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[16:58:01] <Al_nz1> I cant see it in the html frame?
[16:58:09] <robertmaxrees> because it's added by bootstrap.
[16:58:15] <robertmaxrees> alsO: that fiddle is busted.,
[16:58:41] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: oh so its in the rendered html the client sees?
[16:58:43] <robertmaxrees> selectpicker is undefined.
[16:58:53] <robertmaxrees> more than likely.
[17:00:26] <Al_nz1> my rendered html for a select picker looks like : <select size="3" name="episode.locationType" class="selectpicker" id="locationtype" title="Choose">
[17:00:26] <Al_nz1> so I cant even work out why clone.find('.bootstrap-select').remove(); removes anything? again bootstrap-select doesnt exist?
[17:00:52] <robertmaxrees> not in the fiddle because selectpicker isn't initializing.
[17:01:17] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: that was from my code
[17:01:22] <robertmaxrees> hard for me to help if what i have in front of me doesn't actually function/match your code.
[17:01:25] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:01:34] <robertmaxrees> and my crystal ball is in the shop hahahahhaa
[17:01:47] <Al_nz1> ya - ok will try to get a fiddle going :-)
[17:01:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:01:54] <Al_nz1> sometimes thats harder than the solution
[17:02:29] <robertmaxrees> i mean, the easy thing here would be to learn to use your dev tools heh.
[17:06:10] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/36743/
[17:06:15] <Al_nz1> i do use my devtools!
[17:06:33] <Al_nz1> and I cant see a .bootstrap-select anywhere!
[17:06:35] <robertmaxrees> so what's the bug here?
[17:06:38] <Al_nz1> never the less it removes them
[17:06:44] <Al_nz1> the cloned dropdown is empty
[17:06:54] <Al_nz1> despite reinitalizing the select picker
[17:06:58] <robertmaxrees> well
[17:07:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting an error on that fiddle.
[17:07:12] <robertmaxrees> "selectpicker is not a function"
[17:08:05] <robertmaxrees> are you getting something like that on your site?
[17:09:54] <Al_nz1> ok - try this: https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/36744/
[17:10:46] <Al_nz1> No I dont get that on my site as I i have the js loaded
[17:11:27] <robertmaxrees> okay./
[17:12:10] <Al_nz1> see on the fiddle
[17:12:16] <Al_nz1> it appears to remove the selectpicker
[17:12:18] <robertmaxrees> so why do you think that's selecting more than one element at a time?
[17:12:20] <Al_nz1> but doesnt put it back?
[17:13:28] <Al_nz1> huh? my understanding of the issue, is that I need to reinitalize the select pickers by removing a class (which I cant find in the dom) and enabling a script back on the tag?
[17:13:29] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 also: how are you so sure that fiddle works?
[17:13:41] <Al_nz1> my fiddle doesnt work! thats the point
[17:13:57] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i mean the example you found.
[17:14:11] <Al_nz1> well it did clone the picker with the values?
[17:14:19] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't for me/.
[17:14:27] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: can you tell me the difference between these two statements?
[17:14:33] <randymarsh9> 1. $(selector).fadeOut().promise().done(function() { ... stuff to do after fade completes.. });
[17:14:38] <randymarsh9> versus
[17:14:41] <randymarsh9> 2. $(selector).fadeOut(function() { ... stuff to do after fade completes.. });
[17:14:45] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 can you make a fiddle with those?
[17:14:53] <robertmaxrees> so it's easier to read? :)
[17:14:56] <randymarsh9> sure
[17:15:23] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 the example fiddle you sent that you're copying from doesn't work.
[17:15:25] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/Lhngrkow/
[17:15:32] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: what happends when you click Add More?
[17:15:39] <Al_nz1> I get another dropdown and button
[17:15:41] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[17:15:46] <Al_nz1> chrome?
[17:15:52] <robertmaxrees> link the example again?
[17:15:59] <Al_nz1> http://jsfiddle.net/N663T/20/
[17:16:04] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 one uses promises, the other uses callbacks.
[17:16:14] <randymarsh9> yea i know
[17:16:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'm gettintg console errors ont hat.
[17:16:25] <randymarsh9> i guess my question is, what's the difference between using one or the other
[17:16:39] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: sure - but when I click the Add More it does clone
[17:16:40] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 promises are arguably "cleaner" and far more flexible.
[17:16:53] <randymarsh9> but they accomplish the same thing?
[17:16:55] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 iot's bad to pattern after a broken example.
[17:16:58] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 roughly.
[17:17:05] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: cool thank you!!
[17:17:07] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 promises are a lot more flexible imo.
[17:17:11] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ok, well my fiddle doesnt error
[17:17:33] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 and it works differently tahn the example, right?
[17:17:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:17:45] <Al_nz1> its setup roughly the same
[17:17:53] <robertmaxrees> except the example has an error.
[17:17:55] <robertmaxrees> yours doesn't./
[17:18:06] <Al_nz1> yeah, and his works, mine doesnt lol
[17:18:13] <robertmaxrees> his is broken.
[17:18:16] <robertmaxrees> which is my point.
[17:18:25] <robertmaxrees> you're patterning yourself after a brojen example.
[17:18:29] <robertmaxrees> so the example is flawed.
[17:18:31] <Al_nz1> so, from my example can you see what I should remove and what I should add?
[17:18:48] <robertmaxrees> i already told you what I'd do heh.
[17:19:04] <robertmaxrees> and you keep ignoring my advice soooo (shrug)
[17:19:13] <Al_nz1> I dont even know where to begin with templating tools
[17:19:16] <Al_nz1> or what they are
[17:19:26] <robertmaxrees> i gave you a soluton to all of this last week.
[17:19:39] <Al_nz1> I wasnt here last week!
[17:19:52] <robertmaxrees> might've been the week before.
[17:20:02] <Al_nz1> maybe a month ago ;-)
[17:20:10] <Al_nz1> thats using cloning tools?
[17:20:16] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:20:21] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[17:20:50] <Al_nz1> remind me - what was the solution?
[17:21:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up ##bootstrap at this point.
[17:21:17] <robertmaxrees> they may have a solution more up your alley :)
[17:24:00] <Al_nz1> that channel is dead - but some googling...has brought up this which is more recent than the fiddle : https://github.com/silviomoreto/bootstrap-select/issues/1438
[17:26:57] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: would templating tools fix this?
[17:27:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:27:17] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to fix this.
[17:31:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/36747/
[17:31:07] <robertmaxrees> this would be the easy button./
[17:32:38] <Al_nz1> wait. what the heck did you do? I mean I see the line newPerson.find('.js-selectpicker').selectpicker(); ?
[17:33:01] <robertmaxrees> look at the "person_template"
[17:33:16] <robertmaxrees> i changed the select - took off the selectpicker class and added js-selectpicker.
[17:33:20] <robertmaxrees> that way it doesn't init on pagelaod.
[17:33:28] <robertmaxrees> completely circumvents the problem.
[17:34:35] <Al_nz1> ohh, i see - lemme try locally
[17:35:24] <Al_nz1> damn, you are a smart bugger
[17:35:54] <robertmaxrees> just been at this game for a long time.
[17:37:24] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: how long have you been using jquery?
[17:37:44] <robertmaxrees> a few years.
[17:37:50] <randymarsh9> lucky
[17:38:00] <randymarsh9> wish i started sooner
[17:38:07] <randymarsh9> don't even have time to learn the newer frameworks
[17:38:13] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.  i don't necessarily use it much these days
[17:38:22] <randymarsh9> preact?
[17:38:33] <randymarsh9> is that the new thing
[17:38:46] <Xiiiled> Anyone know why 'this' would be defaulting to 'window' when using .map() against a selector?
[17:39:01] <robertmaxrees> Xiiiled mind showing some code?
[17:39:11] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 the project i'm on is using a third party's framework, which uses riotjs.
[17:39:20] <Xiiiled> Sure. One second.
[17:39:23] <robertmaxrees> our company uses backbone, angular, react, etc.
[17:39:27] <robertmaxrees> plus jquery in a few places.
[17:39:33] <robertmaxrees> all about the job at hand.
[17:40:01] <Xiiiled> robertmaxrees $('td.recordDetailData > table').map(() => console.log($(this)))
[17:40:41] <robertmaxrees> Xiiiled and you're getting window from that?
[17:40:43] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:40:48] <robertmaxrees> because it's a fat arrow.
[17:40:53] <robertmaxrees> so jquery can't bind context.
[17:41:03] <Xiiiled> You're brilliant.
[17:41:13] <robertmaxrees> heh, swap to function or use the args to the callback
[17:41:34] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: is there a way to blank out the currently selected item when cloned?
[17:41:39] <Xiiiled> Didn't think about that, forgot => had implicit context. Usually I prefer it, I guess it's doing more harm than good in this instance.
[17:41:45] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 "blank out"?
[17:41:53] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: riotjs.. is that based on league? lol
[17:41:56] <Al_nz1> they are getting intalised with a value selected
[17:42:00] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 haha naw.
[17:42:04] <randymarsh9> jk
[17:42:22] <randymarsh9> that would be sweet for making games actually
[17:42:24] <randymarsh9> if they had one
[17:42:25] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 check the docs for the select wisget and see what it says about "resetting"
[17:42:38] <robertmaxrees> *widget
[17:43:29] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: actually I take it back - only one is cloning with a default value for some reason
[17:43:52] <robertmaxrees> which?
[17:44:08] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:44:15] <robertmaxrees> did you fix your duplicate ID thing btw?
[17:44:22] <robertmaxrees> 'cause that's going to cause headaches
[17:45:01] <Xiiiled> Using the 'function' syntax, when jQuery binds 'this' does it bind to the element, or a jQuery object?
[17:45:41] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: nah I will do that now
[17:45:48] <robertmaxrees> Xiiiled depends on the method :)
[17:46:04] <robertmaxrees> Xiiiled for map - http://api.jquery.com/map/ => "Within the callback function, this refers to the current DOM element for each iteration."
[17:46:07] <Xiiiled> "Within the callback function, this refers to the current DOM element for each iteration." So, no. Just the element. No different from passing the element from the clalback
[17:46:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:46:21] <Xiiiled> Docs...handy stuff.
[17:46:29] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: just append a number to the new person container
[17:46:32] <Al_nz1> ?
[17:46:43] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 huh?
[17:46:49] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the ID at all on the new elements?
[17:47:00] <Xiiiled> I'll just do (i,e) => and ref e, rather than 'this'
[17:47:16] <Xiiiled> 'this' is usually pretty messy anyway.
[17:47:28] <robertmaxrees> agreed :)
[17:47:36] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: true
[17:47:58] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 earlier you said you'd just remove those IDs anyway soooo
[17:49:17] <Al_nz1>     newPerson.removeAttr('personcontainer'); ?
[17:49:26] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:49:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:49:54] <robertmaxrees> think about why that wouldn't work.
[17:51:27] <Al_nz1> ok
[17:51:38] <robertmaxrees> figure it out? :)
[17:51:50] <Al_nz1> newPerson.find('#personcontiner').removeAttr('id'); ?
[17:52:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:52:24] <robertmaxrees> isn't newPerson the container that has that ID?
[17:52:43] <Al_nz1> yes, and you want me to remove it?
[17:52:50] <robertmaxrees> the id attribute.
[17:52:59] <robertmaxrees> like, don't you do newPerson = $('#newPerson').clone() ?
[17:53:08] <Xiiiled> The attribute has to be on whatever newPerson is referring to.
[17:53:26] <robertmaxrees> so no .find()
[17:53:35] <robertmaxrees> it's just newPerson.removeAttr('id')
[17:54:04] <Al_nz1> but what if there is more than 1 'id' in newPerson (I dont think there is but what if there was?)
[17:54:13] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:54:13] <robertmaxrees> what?
[17:54:18] <robertmaxrees> the element only has one.
[17:54:19] <Xiiiled> elements can only have one id
[17:54:32] <robertmaxrees> like, you can'
[17:54:37] <robertmaxrees> *can't nest the same ID.
[17:54:40] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat an ID.
[17:54:48] <robertmaxrees> this is helping you avoid that.
[17:54:53] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: var newPerson contains many lines of html
[17:55:12] <Al_nz1> there could be a id for this input or some other input
[17:55:16] <robertmaxrees> but the id="newperson" only exists on that parent div.
[17:55:18] <Xiiiled> <div id="container" personcontainer="null">
[17:55:20] <robertmaxrees> okay bnack waaaaay up.
[17:55:24] <robertmaxrees> let's solve the real problem.
[17:55:31] <robertmaxrees> if you have Ids within that "tempalte", don't heh.
[17:55:37] <robertmaxrees> stop using IDs for stuff like that.
[17:55:48] <Xiiiled> $(div.container).removeAttr('personcontainer')
[17:55:53] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes I get that because they would create duplicates which we dot want
[17:56:01] <robertmaxrees> leave one on that parent container, then kill off all the others.
[17:56:11] <robertmaxrees> or find another way to handle the "template" object.
[17:56:35] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: but your line of code newPerson.removeAttr('id') - I want to understand - would it remove ALL 'id's - if there was more than one, or is it targetting a specific one?
[17:56:50] <robertmaxrees> it's removing the id attribute from newPerson
[17:57:09] <Al_nz1> again, if there was more than one - would it remove all of them?
[17:57:13] <robertmaxrees> an element can't have more than one of a given attribute.
[17:57:25] <robertmaxrees> you can't do <div id="foo" id="bar"
[17:57:29] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[17:57:33] <robertmaxrees> so you need to not do that./
[17:57:43] <robertmaxrees> same with <div id="foo bar"
[17:57:58] <Al_nz1> but new Person might have <div id='foo'><div id='bar'> - is newPerson.removeAttr('id') removing all of the id's or just that first one?
[17:58:00] <Xiiiled> Al_nz1 are you talking about if the selector gives you more than one element?
[17:58:19] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 you're conflating concepts here.
[17:58:40] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 don't have any ids on any child nodes.
[17:58:41] <robertmaxrees> period.
[17:58:42] <robertmaxrees> use classes.
[17:58:58] <Xiiiled> "Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements."
[17:59:16] <robertmaxrees> Xiiiled he's asking about child elements as well.
[17:59:22] <robertmaxrees> but wanting to do that is sloppy.
[17:59:22] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I dont have any on the childs - but I still need to understand not just what your line of code does, but how
[17:59:35] <robertmaxrees> it removes the attribute from the given element.
[17:59:51] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't magically run a .find() for you.
[17:59:59] <robertmaxrees> that would be very strange
[18:00:02] <Xiiiled> robertmaxrees I don't think it even works that way. Would you not have to do the recursively?
[18:00:04] <Al_nz1> an element being a single <div somestuff> ?
[18:00:22] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 "an element" == whatever is currently in the object.
[18:00:30] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 this is just like any other jquery method.
[18:00:50] <robertmaxrees> so if you did $('span, p, div'), it would remove the id attribute from all spans, ps, and divs
[18:00:54] <Al_nz1> whaat I am getting at is newPerson = lots of lines of html
[18:01:07] <robertmaxrees> it's still a single object.
[18:01:14] <robertmaxrees> it would remove it from the outermost node.
[18:01:22] <Al_nz1> newPerson is $('#person_template').clone();
[18:01:27] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[18:01:28] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:01:43] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: right so it only removes one id - the first one it encounters?
[18:01:52] <robertmaxrees> no./
[18:02:03] <robertmaxrees> it removed the id of the outermost element.
[18:02:14] <Xiiiled> HTML is nested, right.
[18:02:18] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:02:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8d5Lho7f/ Al_nz1
[18:03:01] <robertmaxrees> this is the same basic concept as your case.
[18:03:35] <Xiiiled> Does that work?
[18:03:41] <robertmaxrees> does what work?
[18:03:43] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle?>
[18:03:46] <Xiiiled> Doesn't seem to work for me.
[18:03:56] <Xiiiled> Yeah, can you even remove "class" with removeAttr?
[18:03:57] <robertmaxrees> browser?
[18:04:02] <Xiiiled> Chrome.
[18:04:16] <Xiiiled> Still has a red border aroudn it
[18:04:45] <robertmaxrees> err
[18:04:48] <robertmaxrees> you only see one, right?
[18:04:53] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8d5Lho7f/1/
[18:04:54] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:05:17] <robertmaxrees> $('div').removeAttr('class') removes the class from the containing element that was selected.
[18:05:27] <robertmaxrees> *the class attribute.
[18:05:34] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't magically traverse the document.
[18:05:52] <Xiiiled> Oh, yeah it did work.
[18:05:56] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:06:04] <Xiiiled> But "p" has the same class applied to it
[18:06:09] <Xiiiled> lol
[18:06:10] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:06:18] <Xiiiled> so its overridden
[18:06:21] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:06:27] <Xiiiled> CSS style, I mean.
[18:06:37] <robertmaxrees> "overridden" by what
[18:06:37] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:06:59] <Xiiiled> CSS @ <p> still applies
[18:07:00] <robertmaxrees> my point was that .removeAttr() removes the given attribute only on the selected element.
[18:07:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:07:12] <robertmaxrees> becase removeAttr only applies to the div in that case.
[18:07:15] <robertmaxrees> my entire point./
[18:07:58] <Xiiiled> Yeah. Would have been a bit better if you just left it off the <p> tag and told him to write the JS in the console.
[18:08:02] <Xiiiled> WOuld have seen the box disappear
[18:08:06] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:08:15] <robertmaxrees> except that doesn't illustrate the point.
[18:08:24] <robertmaxrees> but hey, i've only been doing this a few years, what would I know? ;)
[18:08:26] <robertmaxrees> brb
[18:08:55] <Xiiiled> True; my bad. He's confused about nested elements.
[18:10:24] <xaxxon> I’m trying to write a greasemonkey/userscript that does a sequence of steps that each depend on DOM changes from the previous step but I’m having trouble finding a decent way to synchronize the steps while waiting for DOM changes between them.   I know how to do the invidividual steps (with things like MutationObserver) but just can’t find a sane way to express how/when to do the steps
[18:11:33] <xaxxon> “click button” “wait for window to pop up”  “fill in some input on the window and click ‘next’”  “wait for window to change”  “fill out some more data, hit submit” “wait for window to disappear” “look for another click to start the cycle again"
[18:11:59] <xaxxon> by “wait” I mean there’s some javascript creating new elements and I’m just waiting for it to be “visible” to me
[18:12:14] <xaxxon> any suggestions would be appreciated :)
[18:14:12] <robertmaxrees> back.
[18:14:45] <robertmaxrees> xaxxon are you using jquery?
[18:15:03] <xaxxon> I am .   maybe not making best use of it, though
[18:15:19] <xaxxon> I was using it for .on and .trigger and selectors
[18:15:33] <xaxxon> maybe some other stuff.
[18:15:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you might need to rely on mutationobservers at that point.
[18:16:04] <robertmaxrees> since you're not really able to rely on anything else.
[18:16:15] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: thanks for all your help today and patience
[18:16:20] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 def
[18:16:39] <xaxxon> I just sort of thought that something like this would be a solved issue.  it seems like scripting web stuff would be a pretty common thing to do
[18:16:58] <robertmaxrees> well.
[18:17:03] <robertmaxrees> it IS solved heh
[18:17:09] <robertmaxrees> mutationobservers ;)
[18:18:28] <xaxxon> fair ‘nuff
[19:28:11] <C291> I have a python form (https://paste.debian.net/plainh/cc5e6cfb) which outputs a template if nothing is POSTed, otherwise it outputs the posted data. The JQuery template (https://jsfiddle.net/bkkyrsen/) doesn't post while a plain form (https://jsfiddle.net/n1kobmxj/) does. Can somebody help me with this? Thanks
[20:11:53] <toothfairy_> How do I get the id?  <a class="email-alert" id="message_24" href="/mail/alerts/24/">  I get the href using: var href = e.currentTarget.getAttribute('href')
[20:20:31] <pachet> train a cnn on all of your possible anchor tags and let it predict the id
[20:57:56] <jq> Ughhhhh how can I get dragenter/dragleave to work just anywhere regardless of what actual element you're hovering?
[20:58:15] <jq> If you're draging somewhere on the page I wanna display something, and if you drag off the page I want it to stop displaying
[21:00:47] <kLOs> can someone help me out with this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/y28kp43s/ how would i only select the direct parents when clicking the zero, not all of them
[21:01:11] <kLOs> so when you click the zero it hides both ratings i only want it to hide the rating for the zero clicked
[21:01:32] <kLOs> but it has to be a wildcard selector
[21:21:14] <Xiiiled> Does anyone know how to convert a jQuery object into an array? $.makeArray() doesn't seem to work.
[21:24:28] <pachet> for the purposes of what?
[21:24:33] <pachet> jquery objects are already array-ish
[21:45:37] <C291> Why would this https://jsfiddle.net/bkkyrsen/ not post to a form but https://jsfiddle.net/n1kobmxj/ does?
