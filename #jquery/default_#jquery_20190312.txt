[02:19:18] <toothe> Hi all. I am trying to use the rather complex $.POST() request
[02:19:45] <robertmaxrees> not that complex :)
[02:19:51] <toothe> I am having trouble setting the Content-Type
[02:20:04] <toothe> It keeps defaulting to application/x-www-form-urlencoded: charset=UTF-8
[02:20:08] <robertmaxrees> first off - what version of jquery?
[02:20:25] <robertmaxrees> and how are you trying to set it?
[02:20:37] <toothe> i believe its the latest, but I just need this for a proof of concept
[02:20:40] <toothe> 3.1
[02:20:44] <toothe> 3.3.1
[02:20:48] <toothe> let me shwo code :)
[02:21:05] <robertmaxrees> okay cool.  not all versions support all ajax options ont he shorthand methods.
[02:21:15] <robertmaxrees> which is why i asked.
[02:22:07] <toothe> getting a paste going...
[02:22:14] <toothe> I have to sanitize some data or my client will be upset.
[02:22:27] <robertmaxrees> i just need to see the post itself.
[02:22:31] <robertmaxrees> ignore the rest :)
[02:22:39] <robertmaxrees> (i also have to go to bed soon fwiw)
[02:22:44] <toothe> err, i'll hurry
[02:23:04] <toothe> https://dpaste.de/0Eqh
[02:23:07] <toothe> That's the code
[02:23:09] <toothe> let me get an example
[02:23:58] <robertmaxrees> so 2 things
[02:24:18] <robertmaxrees> 1: you're missng a data: property with the data you want to send.
[02:24:47] <toothe> https://dpaste.de/29wu
[02:24:47] <robertmaxrees> 2: why not just use $.ajax and method: 'POST'?
[02:24:54] <toothe> i'm cool with either
[02:25:06] <robertmaxrees> do both
[02:25:17] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work, then something is real busted.
[02:25:34] <toothe> can $.POST do a post request?
[02:25:35] <robertmaxrees> but setting a bunch of random props on the config object doesn't make sense.
[02:25:37] <toothe> err
[02:25:39] <toothe> excuse me
[02:25:41] <toothe> can it set the type?
[02:26:01] <robertmaxrees> it should be able to but your config object is referencing properties it doesn't support.
[02:26:29] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax({url: 'http://foo.com', method: 'POST", data: {}});
[02:26:40] <robertmaxrees> try just using $.ajax directly.
[02:26:50] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i gotta go.  good luck :)
[02:27:31] <toothe> darn
[02:27:38] <toothe> thanks (even though you're gone)
[02:34:44] <toothe> man, its one problem after the otheer....
[02:37:12] <toothe> yeah, I'm getting a stupid error.
[02:37:16] <toothe> I don't even know how to fix it.
[02:50:40] <toothe> damn
[02:50:42] <toothe> it keeps using OPTIONS
[02:56:11] <toothe> Its this damn cross-domain nonsense, I don't know how to do this.
[04:56:10] <spinningCat> can you suggest me a good calendar plugin?
[13:07:11] <Snerf> I am looking for a way to see what the .val() of an input is, when it is autofilled by the browser, as checking initially on document ready, even with a delay,  .val() is empty
[15:37:13] <yoshie902a> Trying to solve this, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55129145/google-maps-place-api-to-auto-complete-and-parse-vs-geocoder-gem-rails. any help would be apprecaited
