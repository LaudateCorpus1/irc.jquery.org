[00:59:10] <Enerel> log says parsererror? anyidea
[01:01:44] <Enerel> anyone?
[01:02:06] <deecee> Enerel: ajax? have you checked out http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ ?
[01:02:09] <Enerel> status is 200 ok but JSON parsererror
[01:02:55] <deecee> you got a response but it wasn't valid for the datatype it expected
[01:05:14] <Enerel> deecee can you see it live?
[01:06:28] <Enerel> http://www.invescore.mn/login/main_login.php email: test@test.com pass:1111
[01:06:45] <deecee> Enerel: not sure. on firefox I can go to the web console Network tab and see ajax responses
[01:07:05] <Enerel> it was working code but since i changed username to email to login i get this parsererror
[01:07:34] <Enerel> when i refresh it works as signed in
[01:09:15] <Enerel> i cannot figureout the problem last 2 days
[01:10:39] <deecee> is "Array{}" valid json? i'm not very familiar with it beyond the basics
[01:10:53] <deecee> Enerel: did you try looking for that Network view?
[01:10:55] <Enerel> me too i have no idea
[01:15:11] <deecee> Enerel: pretty sure chrome has something similar. find it, and you can check your own ajax responses
[01:16:29] <Enerel> do you mean network tab that loads the files?
[01:18:03] <deecee> Enerel: loads the files?  I don't know.  I know that it shows me what request was made (POST to checklogin.php), what was sent (email and pw), and what was received (200 OK, "Array{"email" ...)
[01:18:45] <Enerel> yes it works and receives fine
[01:18:55] <Enerel> i dont know why there is error code there
[01:19:00] <Enerel> parsererror
[01:19:05] <Enerel> not JSON forma i guess
[01:19:17] <deecee> Enerel: well, yeah
[01:19:42] <deecee> a quick search gave me no indication that "Array" is valid json. where did that come from?
[01:19:55] <deecee> json arrays use []
[01:22:19] <Enerel> hmm
[01:38:50] <Enerel> deecee: do you know why console.log(html.response + ' ' + html.email); does not trigger
[01:39:14] <tash> on what planet is 2 > 18?  if( fabQty > fabQtyDue ) { alert("test"); } is evaluating to true and alerting "test".  I add console.log(fabQty); and console.log(fabQtyDue); prior to the alert and the console logs 2, then 18 ... what the?
[01:40:00] <deecee> tash: alphabetical order?
[01:40:41] <deecee> Enerel: no, not enough information
[01:54:51] <Mapper99> Quick question.  I have an autocomplete input box.  How do I capture the event when someone uses the mouse to click on one of the items presented in the input box?
[02:20:54] <Cork> Mapper99: it should fire the same event as if it is done with the keyboard (select)
[02:31:01] <Mapper99> >>Cork I added these listeners right to the html but they don't fire either  onChange=\"alert('here');\"
[02:31:14] <Mapper99> echo "<input id=\"autocomplete\" type = \"text\" name=\"selectOfficeData\" style=\"color:black;background-color:#ccffcc\" onClick=\"this.value='';\" onChange=\"alert('here');\" value=\"Enter part of a name...\"   onkeydown=\"if (event.keyCode == 13) { document.frmSelectEmployee.submit(); return false; }\">";
[02:31:16] <Cork> Mapper99: don't use event attributes
[02:31:24] <Cork> use event listeners
[02:32:01] <Mapper99> I was hoping to use a jQuery event to grab when a user clicks on a value in the dropdown
[02:32:09] <Cork> no
[02:32:41] <Cork> and event attributes isn't hooked into the event system so you won't get those for anything from js
[02:32:58] <Cork> (and they will mess other things up too, so don't ever use them)
[02:33:58] <Mapper99> ok.  sounds like I'm outa luck!
[02:35:22] <Cork> Mapper99: no, just use event listeners and bind the select event
[02:35:47] <Cork> but if you absolutely have to put the handling as attributes on the dom element, then yes you're out of luck
[02:53:45] <Enerel> http://www.invescore.mn/login/main_login.php email: test@test.com pass:1111 JSON Parsererror
[02:53:49] <Enerel> anyidea?
[02:55:08] <Cork> Enerel: you write "Array" before the object
[02:55:26] <Enerel> pardon?
[02:55:32] <Cork> 'Array{"email":"test@test.com","response":"true"}' <-- not json
[02:55:39] <Cork> '{"email":"test@test.com","response":"true"}' <-- correct json
[02:55:53] <Cork> well "true" should be true
[02:55:55] <Enerel> i used working script changed variable email
[02:56:06] <Enerel> only i used to be working before
[02:56:17] <Cork> ya, cause you didn't have "Array" before the json
[02:56:23] <Enerel> also i searched where does that array created cannot find any clue
[02:56:44] <Cork> => ##php
[02:58:03] <Enerel> http://pastebin.com/mptAbZiW this is the php i guess but no array right
[02:58:43] <Cork> not really on topic for this channel, but ya, you would have to look earlier in the file
[02:59:15] <Cork> ==> ##php <==
[03:03:02] <bpcpi> hi
[03:03:53] <bpcpi> I want to find the device name like andriod or linux or windows if some1 opens my website
[03:04:41] <Cork> bpcpi: its the useragent string, though you can't count on it being correct
[03:05:20] <Cork> browsers fake it quite often now days cause so many sites use broken ua sniffing
[03:05:48] <Cork> (also note that firefox on android doesn't display android anywhere)
[03:20:04] <Enerel> Cork there is no norw saying array in my PHP
[03:20:07] <Enerel> word
[03:20:24] <Cork> it doesn't have to be explicitly in the code
[03:20:32] <Cork> it can be an output from something too
[03:20:39] <Cork> and is why i pointed you to that channel
[03:21:00] <Cork> the point is, there isn't anything js can do as the data isn't valid
[03:21:23] <Cork> (well you could technically use regex to remove the junk data and then parse it but...)
[03:21:24] <Enerel> can we at least ignore that error and proceed with JS?
[03:21:30] <Cork> no
[03:21:38] <Cork> you can't ignore it as it isn't parsable
[03:21:43] <Enerel> or make JSON to TXT
[03:22:01] <Enerel> i mean data
[03:22:21] <Cork> just debug the data you have server side and find where the "Array" comes from
[03:22:32] <Cork> it shouldn't be that hard
[03:22:45] <Enerel> last 2 says searching
[03:22:58] <Enerel> 10 php 1 js could not find
[03:23:02] <Enerel> need hand bro
[03:23:23] <theskillwithin> hm
[03:23:24] <Cork> for the last time ask in =====>>>> ##php <<========
[03:23:33] <Enerel> okay
[03:23:41] <Cork> sigh...
[03:23:53] <Enerel> relax take it easy
[03:23:56] <Enerel> love ya bro
[03:24:02] <Cork> well i've pointed you there for times...
[03:24:11] <theskillwithin> http://devtipsshow.com/killingitwithjquery/
[03:24:37] <Cork> theskillwithin: why do you keep spamming that link??
[03:24:43] <Cork> you've been at it for days...
[03:25:01] <Enerel> ban him
[03:25:13] <Cork> that is what will happen if he don't answer ya
[03:25:57] <Cork> theskillwithin: well?
[03:26:28] <Enerel> Cork 1,2 last question
[03:26:40] <Cork> Enerel: shoot?
[03:26:46] <Enerel> in my js i have console.log(html.response + ' ' + html.email); why it does not output anything?
[03:27:05] <Cork> uh... html??
[03:27:31] <Enerel> success: function(html){ console.log(html.response + ' ' + html.email); ...
[03:27:49] <Cork> well html, is "data" and it is the content of the response
[03:28:03] <Cork> Enerel: and as the json can't be parsed the success hook isn't ever called
[03:28:25] <Cork> (the error hook gets called instead)
[03:37:29] <Powerhead> Hey guys. Could you advice? why this form doesn't submits in Chrome, but works in Firefox? https://jsbin.com/nolovawipu/edit?html,output
[03:38:14] <Powerhead> Is there a way to disable submit button while form submitting? i need to upload a file and it takes a while
[03:39:09] <dni-_> ofc
[03:39:30] <dni-_> just set attribute disabled on .submit() event
[03:40:11] <dni-_> Powerhead:
[03:41:22] <Powerhead> Right. Cool
[03:41:24] <Powerhead> thanks )
[03:43:18] <dni-_> https://jsbin.com/leladuceki/1/edit?html,output
[03:57:26] <Enerel> Cork can you see now?
[03:57:36] <Cork> see what?
[03:57:37] <Enerel> sorry for disturbing
[03:57:40] <Enerel> the array
[03:57:46] <Enerel> is now Obj
[03:57:54] <Cork> uh, just check the response you're self
[03:58:05] <Cork> *yourself
[04:25:57] <aortmann> Hi, using a body contextmenu listener for the right click event. The pageX and pageY coordinates seem to be wrong cause of fixed header and a navigation bar. Is there a way to calculate it dynamically with offset or something like this?
[04:28:42] <Cork> aortmann: haven't fiddled with it for ages, but i think you might get the offset based on a parent element
[04:28:55] <Cork> adding that parents position to the pageX/Y should fix the position
[04:29:09] <Cork> but no, there are no other value for mouse position
[06:33:35] <user_corrupt> Does anyone have any idea how to make the following script NOT allow for multiple selections? https://jsfiddle.net/j8t7m0aj/8/
[06:39:17] <fleeggs> hey i'm looking to document my work, i looked at jsdocs, but it says it's for API's, does that mean not for internal documentation, i'm kind of confused
[07:36:14] <sonu_nk> hi when i am appending element in iFrame element using this   $(".CHECKFRONT_DROPLET").contents().find("input#customer_name").attr("data-track",'leadname');   then error : Error: Permission denied to access property "document"
[07:36:17] <sonu_nk> any solution ?
[08:31:00] <Cork> sonu_nk: you can't go cross domain
[08:32:52] <hellyeah> what is the difference between jquery and jquery-mboile
[08:33:08] <hellyeah> the difference includes few methods or more than that
[08:33:31] <Cork> hellyeah: jquery-mobile is more a replacement for jquery-ui
[08:33:45] <Cork> but it targets mobile devices
[08:34:19] <Cork> so it works more with "views" and sliding then dialogs and sliders
[08:35:18] <hellyeah> ic
[08:36:02] <hellyeah> jquery code can run in mobile device. jquery-mobile has some tools like dialog, datepickers, tab etc. like jquery ui has. Is that what you meant
[08:36:04] <hellyeah> ?
[08:38:11] <hellyeah> sounds cool
[08:38:32] <hellyeah> but jquery-mboile has some difference in event right like touch instead of hover
[08:45:32] <Cork> hellyeah: no it has ui elements but not dialog
[08:45:48] <Cork> it has other ui elements that make sense for touch devices
[08:46:22] <Cork> (though that said, i don't make a good advocate for jquery mobile as i don't like the lib)
[08:46:28] <hellyeah> so it is jquery ui's esque?
[08:46:45] <Cork> i don't use ui or mobile for mobile devices
[08:46:50] <hellyeah> Cork:  you dont like the lib hmm
[08:46:51] <Cork> i use plain jquery
[08:47:04] <hellyeah> plain jquery for mobile device?
[08:47:13] <hellyeah> it seems it does work actually
[08:47:15] <Cork> hellyeah: it pushes you to make the page with a hard javascript requirement
[08:47:21] <hellyeah> including jquery-ui elements
[08:47:34] <Cork> and i'm very very much against that model
[08:47:56] <Cork> hellyeah: sure jquery works just fine on mobiles (why wouldn't it?)
[08:48:10] <Cork> jquery ui has some problems with drag events
[08:48:24] <hellyeah> i supposed jquery-mobile is totally different lib with method and events
[08:48:33] <Cork> so for sliders to work you need a plugin that uses touch-start/end etc.
[08:48:42] <Cork> i think it depends on jquery
[08:48:47] <Cork> but i might remember wrong
[08:49:18] <hellyeah> so what i understand is "use jquery and jqury mobile elements"
[08:49:27] <hellyeah> instead of jquery-ui
[08:49:43] <Cork> if you want to use jquery-mobile yes
[08:50:00] <Cork> mobile isn't a full replacement for jquery-ui
[08:50:04] <sumedhN> thats right cork
[08:51:49] <hellyeah> so if wanna use smt that is not in jquery-mobile i need to hack jquery-ui for making it convenient for mobile device?
[08:52:26] <Cork> not hack
[08:52:40] <Cork> http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[08:52:44] <Cork> just include that lib
[08:54:03] <hellyeah> wow
[08:54:06] <hellyeah> thats good new
[08:54:07] <hellyeah> s
[08:54:19] <hellyeah> include that lab and you can use jquery ui
[08:54:32] <hellyeah> thats nice
[08:55:14] <Cork> that said, i would still consider dialog a bad choice for mobile devices :)
[08:55:34] <Cork> but ya, it makes sliders draggable usable
[08:56:17] <hellyeah> it is because dialog covers really good place on mobile?
[08:56:25] <hellyeah> what is your suggestion about that?
[08:57:08] <Cork> cause you don't normally have dialog on mobile devices
[08:57:15] <Cork> you normally use cover screens instead
[08:57:35] <Cork> that is the main reason
[08:58:04] <hellyeah> hmm for example you have system monitoring software
[08:58:19] <hellyeah> you can see table on the screen and when you click button on the line
[08:58:29] <hellyeah> you display all information of spesific line in a place
[08:58:36] <hellyeah> in web you will do that with dialog
[08:58:48] <hellyeah> in mobile, you will do that with cover screen?_
[08:58:57] <Cork> i would prob use a plain position fixed "fake" dialog for normal web
[08:59:08] <Cork> and use a media query to make that a cover screen on mobile
[08:59:17] <Cork> (with scroll)
[08:59:49] <hellyeah> hmm i see what you mean
[09:00:04] <hellyeah> that seems a good idea
[09:00:19] <hellyeah> you can do it responsive media queries anyway
[09:00:28] <hellyeah> and you can give that scroll feature
[09:01:15] <hellyeah> good i understand
[09:42:01] <_twg_> I've got some bootstrap tabs setup and I'm needing to set the "active" class on the li and div element based on the date.  Can anyone help me with my $.each logic?  https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/rqo9w85y/
[09:58:17] <sumedhN> @_twg_ can you elaborate more what exactly you want to do?
[10:06:52] <_twg_> sumendhN I'm looking at the current date and then looking through the array of dates and applying an 'active' class to the correct items.
[10:59:07] <pugtor> hey guys, I don't know if my question is more directed towards jquery or webserver. I guess the first question I have is, if I'm using 2 buttons .on hover to pull in two different images, should I be seeing both image requests show up in DevTools, under Network? It seems like sometimes that's the case but other times it doesn't show in the network panel it just loads it, presumably from cahce..
[11:00:54] <pugtor> The "presumably" from cache part is because sometimes the image request shows up and it says (from cache), which further confuses me on whether or not it's caching I'm looking at or something else entirely.
[11:01:55] <deecee> oh, that is confusing, then.
[11:02:52] <deecee> it would make me wonder if there are multiple caches or something
[11:03:08] <pugtor> Honestly what I'm curious of, using 2 buttons (again, hover) that control an image that gets pulled in, should I always be seeing the resource request, cached or not?
[11:09:46] <afidegnum> hello, using the chosen js library, my container, when clicked doesn't have a container, can anyone please assist?
[11:09:50] <afidegnum> http://gsam.ga:9192/projects/pm/1137986/activity_add
[11:16:22] <afidegnum> any insight please, ?
[11:26:10] <hlve> Hey uh, anything inheriently wrong with this as a way to detect IE via feature test? https://jsfiddle.net/gLdrdjqo/4/
[11:30:06] <pugtor> If I was using 2 buttons (.on hover) that control an image that gets pulled in, should I always be seeing the resource request in Chromes DevTools->Network panel, cached or not?
[11:31:15] <pugtor> What I'm looking to do is not nessicarily disable browsers from caching the image, but if I hover button 1, pull the image in. Hover button 2, pull the image in. However, if I hover over button 1 again, I'd like for the browser to at least send a request back to the server to see if the file has been modified.
[11:32:29] <pugtor> Even at that, I have cache-control set to no-cache, and it doesn't always send the request to the server once it's initially pulled the image in.
[11:34:51] <C__> Hi there trying to get click to slide toggle a sub menu and double click to open a link has anyone else maybe come across this situation and have a solution?
[11:35:43] <robertmaxrees> pugtor the browser won't do that if it's already loaded the image.  you'll need to append a cachebust to the url if you want it to try again.
[11:35:53] <robertmaxrees> but that bypasses all caching sooo.
[11:35:58] <pugtor> Yea. bleh
[11:40:56] <afidegnum> any insight please?
[11:41:12] <robertmaxrees> didn't see your question afidegnum
[11:41:47] <arc_> [11:09:48] <afidegnum> hello, using the chosen js library, my container, when clicked doesn't have a container, can anyone please assist?
[11:41:47] <arc_> [11:09:51] <afidegnum> http://gsam.ga:9192/projects/pm/1137986/activity_add
[11:42:16] <robertmaxrees> getting an error hitting that URL.
[11:42:19] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle?
[11:43:07] <afidegnum> robertmaxrees: the server is on now
[11:43:13] <afidegnum> i pasted the url in fiddle, it doesn't load
[11:43:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:43:35] <robertmaxrees> still getting an error. and fiddles let me modify code and show you fixes.
[11:43:39] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[11:43:50] <C__> Hi there trying to get click to slide toggle a sub menu and double click to open a link - any ideas?
[11:44:08] <arc_> yeah, don't do that :p
[11:44:10] <robertmaxrees> C__ you'll want to find something that handles click vs double-click
[11:44:19] <robertmaxrees> but that's generally a bad idea.
[11:44:26] <C__> any solutions?
[11:44:34] <robertmaxrees> because click vs double-click isn't really a thing that users expect to have happen.
[11:44:41] <afidegnum> robertmaxrees: how do i paste the url in fiddle? i pasted it earliar, but it doesn't parse,
[11:44:41] <C__> I know...
[11:44:47] <robertmaxrees> so then why build it?
[11:44:50] <C__> Cannot seem to think of another way round it
[11:44:58] <arc_> make the element that opens a submenu separate from the elements that take the user somewhere
[11:45:01] <robertmaxrees> why not go with the much more common hover vs click
[11:45:10] <C__> Beacuse it is a mobile menuy
[11:45:13] <C__> menu*
[11:45:38] <robertmaxrees> then rethink the menu itelf at that point.
[11:45:45] <robertmaxrees> becuase tap vs double-tap is even weirder.
[11:45:54] <arc_> definitely
[11:46:03] <C__> good point except I cannot seem to find an alternative
[11:46:23] <arc_> hamburger menu
[11:46:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:46:35] <C__> Thats what i have created
[11:46:54] <C__> at present it is as you say a hamburger menu with 5 main links
[11:47:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing you have base categories and then subcats under each of those?
[11:47:06] <afidegnum> robertmaxrees: how do i paste the url of the page into jsfiddle, ? i can't make it work here,
[11:47:10] <C__> true
[11:47:18] <C__> you got it
[11:47:20] <robertmaxrees> afidegnum the url of what page?
[11:47:21] <arc_> afidegnum that's not how it works. you have to put your code directly in there
[11:47:45] <arc_> in the separate sections for html, js, css
[11:47:46] <robertmaxrees> C__ we solved that at my work by having a staight up "all {category name}" link under each of those.
[11:47:47] <C__> The main links need to be links but slo open the sub menus
[11:48:01] <robertmaxrees> C__ yeah, no.  don't have them link at all for mobile.
[11:48:04] <C__> A what and a what?
[11:48:17] <arc_> so you have "chairs / desks / all furniture"
[11:48:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:49:00] <robertmaxrees> C__ so the user taps the parent category - that opens a submenu with your list of subcategories.  as apart of that list, you'd also have a link to the parent category.
[11:49:01] <C__> sounds like you have had the same prob then?
[11:49:15] <C__> Yeah I was thinking that too
[11:49:17] <robertmaxrees> i just said that's how we solved it :)
[11:49:34] <C__> So I have main cat > main cat > sub cat
[11:49:56] <robertmaxrees> more like main cat > main cat link, sub cat link, sub cat link etc.
[11:50:14] <C__> That seems to be the only way?
[11:50:25] <robertmaxrees> it's going to be the cleanest for what you want to achieve.
[11:50:34] <robertmaxrees> the only one that won't confuse the hell out of your users.
[11:50:40] <C__> Yeah I can see what you mean
[11:50:55] <C__> Just wondered if there may have been another way?
[11:51:00] <arc_> you definitely want to avoid your users having to learn a new interaction just to use your one website
[11:51:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:51:08] <C__> true
[11:51:09] <robertmaxrees> that's why the double-tap idea is bad.
[11:51:16] <C__> I know I thought so too
[11:51:19] <robertmaxrees> your site won't be predictable.
[11:51:24] <C__> tricky..
[11:51:50] <C__> Cheers for the ideas!!!
[11:51:55] <C__> realy apreciate it
[11:52:02] <robertmaxrees> sure
[11:53:24] <robertmaxrees> soooo tiiiired.
[11:54:31] <AwkwardCough> should sleep more
[11:54:53] <robertmaxrees> heh, i should, but the last few days have been a real doozy.
[11:55:01] <robertmaxrees> came home friday to a burst water heater.
[11:55:10] <AwkwardCough> oooh dang
[11:56:08] <robertmaxrees> water in all but one room of the house.  gonna have to rip up the floors, subfloors, new walls, doors.
[11:56:09] <robertmaxrees> etc
[11:58:15] <arc_> hope your insurance company doesn't jerk you around
[11:58:54] <robertmaxrees> nah they shouldn't.  our agent showed up on friday even though she totally didn't have to.  our deductible is super low and everybody has said this agency is pretty great to work with.
[11:59:07] <arc_> cool
[11:59:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[11:59:14] <AwkwardCough> very nice
[11:59:34] <arc_> did you say "like a good neighbor, state farm is there"
[11:59:39] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.
[12:07:35] <taplar> robertmaxrees: you going to go tankless next?
[12:12:35] <robertmaxrees> taplar probabl.
[12:12:42] <robertmaxrees> *probably.  I CAN get them super cheap.
[12:13:39] <robertmaxrees> but I'm not even there yet.  waiting to hear from the adjuster so i know just how much insurance will pony up to replace what's there.
[12:51:12] <d[10]> anyone know create fadeIn with time ?
[12:51:24] <robertmaxrees> mind rephrasing that?
[13:08:59] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[13:11:50] <hellyeah> yo
[13:11:54] <robertmaxrees> sup
[13:12:39] <hellyeah> hoping to rest after tiring day what abouy uo?
[13:12:42] <hellyeah> about*
[13:12:50] <robertmaxrees> hoping i get a chance to rest soon haha
[13:14:05] <hellyeah> rest in peace :D
[13:17:10] <physikoi> Hello #jquery!
[13:17:20] <robertmaxrees> good morning physikoi
[13:19:09] <hellyeah> well i learnt smt very useful here
[13:19:40] <hellyeah> i can use jquery in mobile. That will work. Also with library i can use jquery-ui also
[13:19:55] <robertmaxrees> i would use jquery mobile for mobile, but yeah.
[13:19:57] <hellyeah> so i cannot show my effort to jquery-mobile.
[13:19:58] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[13:20:09] <hellyeah> actually i should
[13:20:32] <hellyeah> but at least i can adopt my script to mobile device
[13:22:49] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: good afternoon :)
[13:23:01] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: west coast?
[13:23:22] <robertmaxrees> yep
[13:25:08] <physikoi> I have a bit of a problem with a library I'm working on. I create this element with a bunch of nested elements with various namespace event listeners. When I cast .remove() on the "wrapper" elements, everything seems to disappear. However, it seems that it doesn't remove some of the nested elements. Why might this be?
[13:25:19] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: East for me.
[13:26:19] <physikoi> aaaaaah
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:26:31] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:27:28] <physikoi> I may have missed a response to my question. I accidentally told irssi to list every channel in existence, or something. Had to kill it.
[13:27:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your issue.
[13:27:49] <robertmaxrees> because it shouldn't be doing that.
[13:28:40] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: any typical mistakes i might be overlooking?
[13:28:52] <robertmaxrees> you don't have a single root node.
[13:29:04] <robertmaxrees> so you have siblings that you think are children.
[13:30:09] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: single root node? Would that not be the "wrapper" div?
[13:30:14] <robertmaxrees> should be.
[13:30:24] <robertmaxrees> but if you've done something wrong, you don't have a single root node.
[13:31:13] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: ok thanks. i'm going to dig around the code a bit for dupes
[13:31:26] <robertmaxrees> also make sure you're appending to the correctly places.
[13:33:52] <hellyeah> physikoi:  if you fiddle it robertmaxrees will help you more for sure
[13:34:02] <robertmaxrees> most of us can better help with a fiddle.
[13:34:05] <robertmaxrees> not just me ;)
[13:34:11] <hellyeah> :D
[13:34:28] <hellyeah> well you are much better than me :p
[13:34:30] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: What i do,without consistency, blah.appendTo($wrapper) or $wrapper.append(blah). Some subtle difference?
[13:34:47] <robertmaxrees> but if he's resistant to share code I wouldn't worry about it.  no need to highlight him in that case.
[13:34:50] <hellyeah> those are same
[13:34:55] <physikoi> hellyeah: oh yeah, good point :)
[13:35:01] <robertmaxrees> i prefer the former, but they do the exact same thing.
[13:35:22] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: it's okay, it's just a github collab
[13:35:25] <hellyeah> is it just seperation of concerns robertmaxrees
[13:35:30] <hellyeah> ?
[13:35:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[13:35:44] <robertmaxrees> you mean which version you use?
[13:36:28] <hellyeah> i mean
[13:36:35] <hellyeah> you prefer "former" one
[13:36:41] <hellyeah> :D
[13:36:41] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:37:05] <hellyeah> is it seperation of concern or is it just personal preference?
[13:37:15] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting "separation of concern
[13:37:19] <robertmaxrees> " from?
[13:37:37] <physikoi> https://jsfiddle.net/kojL88be/
[13:37:41] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with that and everything to do with consistency.
[13:37:48] <hellyeah> there is two ways doing same thing. And probably most people will prefer first one
[13:37:50] <physikoi> Something is happening, i think, around line 22.
[13:38:04] <hellyeah> physikoi:  did you check "console"?
[13:38:13] <hellyeah> developer tools
[13:38:48] <physikoi> It is those nav elements that keep "piling" up. That is, each time i quit (remove all elements), the nav elements increase for the next instance as if the previous ones had never been remove.
[13:39:00] <robertmaxrees> can you actually make this fiddle work?
[13:39:14] <robertmaxrees> 'cause that's over 500 lines of code.
[13:39:48] <physikoi> hellyeah: sure did. On line 22, I am counting the number of images on each instance -- the figure is correct. This suggest, to me, that the original elements were never removed.
[13:40:19] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: oh, a full working example? Like the CSS and HTML?
[13:40:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  that's what jsfiddle is for.
[13:40:28] <robertmaxrees> full test cases.
[13:40:32] <physikoi> ah, ok. brb
[13:40:39] <hellyeah> physikoi:  you should simplify it
[13:40:39] <robertmaxrees> :) should be pretty quick./
[13:40:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:41:03] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  am i wrong :D
[13:41:16] <robertmaxrees> slow your roll there buddy
[13:41:31] <hellyeah> okey i got it wrong i am sorry
[13:41:36] <robertmaxrees> yesh, a reduced test case would be helpful.
[13:41:41] <robertmaxrees> but that may not be necessary here.
[13:42:15] <hellyeah> people said me about "short code" here
[13:42:30] <robertmaxrees> yes, isolated test cases are often helpful.
[13:42:37] <hellyeah> i showed some almost one thousan line codes here xD
[13:42:40] <robertmaxrees> but the issue here might be really obvious after we see a functioning fiddle.
[13:43:04] <hellyeah> thats why yu are much better than me and i respect you
[13:43:16] <robertmaxrees> lol it's not about being better or worse duder.
[13:44:27] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  :) i just try to make a joke anyways
[13:44:32] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[13:49:25] <physikoi> hmm, can't seem to get it working. https://jsfiddle.net/kojL88be/6/
[13:49:53] <physikoi> is there a way to ensure my js loads after jquery is ready?
[13:50:07] <robertmaxrees> you already are
[13:50:29] <robertmaxrees> javascript -> load type.
[13:51:54] <physikoi> derp i know what im missing
[13:56:29] <physikoi> well, i was missing the call, but still not working. https://jsfiddle.net/kojL88be/10/
[13:56:51] <physikoi> Anyway,thanks robertmaxrees.
[13:56:52] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:56:59] <robertmaxrees> right, so your JS can't go in the html box.
[13:57:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kojL88be/11/
[13:57:33] <robertmaxrees> so how do I see the broken behavior?
[13:59:32] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: oh you got it -- thanks! Click just the first image, you should get two nav elements in the nav wrapper (gray thing with two circles). Close it, then repeat. you will now see four nave elements instead of four.
[13:59:56] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: keeps adding two more each time you repeat.
[14:00:36] <robertmaxrees> you mean the imagelightbox-navitem ?
[14:00:48] <physikoi> yeah, exactly, sir.
[14:04:25] <robertmaxrees> poking.
[14:04:45] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: k, thanks
[14:05:04] <robertmaxrees> in the meantime, check ytour _onEnd to make sure it's really doing what you thinlk.
[14:05:09] <robertmaxrees> and the stuff that calls it.
[14:06:25] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: ok, checking now
[14:09:30] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[14:09:31] <robertmaxrees> figured it out.
[14:09:36] <robertmaxrees> sorry - confusing code.
[14:09:46] <robertmaxrees> so - you've got $navObject, right?
[14:11:42] <robertmaxrees> basically, you're always updating and modifying that object directly.
[14:11:52] <robertmaxrees> so even when you remove the parent element, that reference persists.
[14:12:02] <robertmaxrees> you don't recreate any of those vars.
[14:12:59] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: ahhhhhhhhhh.
[14:13:29] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: that is the only object, other than $wrapper, that gets updated directly.
[14:13:33] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:13:37] <robertmaxrees> that's where your problem lies.
[14:15:11] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: thank you so much, I'm going to look into append some more. I should be able to update it "indirectly", yes?
[14:15:30] <robertmaxrees> you mean update the appended one instead?
[14:18:34] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: i think i see. like do something like "var $newNavObject = $navObject;" and then append items to $newNavObject?
[14:18:51] <robertmaxrees> more like $newNavObject = $navObject.clone();
[14:18:57] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll have the exact same problems.
[14:28:12] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: would you believe me if i said it still doesnt work?
[14:28:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see how you're using it
[14:29:53] <physikoi> https://jsfiddle.net/kojL88be/13/
[14:30:11] <physikoi> I added navObject = $navObject.clone()
[14:30:22] <physikoi> I also tried .clone(true), but nada
[14:30:22] <robertmaxrees> nononono
[14:30:26] <robertmaxrees> needs to have a different name.
[14:33:26] <robertmaxrees> but you're going to have the same problems still.
[14:35:13] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: yeah, i see. even with a different name the error persists :/
[14:35:34] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: you still think it has something to do with deleting a reference as opposed to element?
[14:35:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:35:48] <robertmaxrees> all you did was move where that var gets held.
[14:36:08] <robertmaxrees> you're doing the clone when the plugin loads basically.
[14:36:12] <robertmaxrees> same exact issue.
[14:37:59] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: $('<a/>',{href:'#',class:"imagelightbox-navitem"}).clone()
[14:38:09] <robertmaxrees> again
[14:38:10] <robertmaxrees> same issue.
[14:38:14] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: cloning the item -- not the navwrappe
[14:38:18] <physikoi> it worked!
[14:38:20] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:38:30] <robertmaxrees> that makes no sense, but OK.
[14:38:42] <robertmaxrees> oh i think i see what you did.
[14:38:44] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: know it didn't. sorry
[14:39:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's one way to do it.
[14:39:04] <physikoi> robertmaxrees:
[14:39:33] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: ok, it DOES work when i use the same image after quiting.
[14:40:00] <gambl0re> hi robert
[14:40:11] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: you've gotten me much further along -- i've been banging my head against the wall on this one. Cloneing. I need to understand it !
[14:40:32] <physikoi> robertmaxrees: thank you very much for your assitance and patience
[14:40:36] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[14:41:13] <robertmaxrees> i'll be excited once i can stop taking this much benadryl.
[14:41:39] <taplar> and awake
[14:41:55] <robertmaxrees> seriously.
[14:42:33] <taplar> the one time i took it as a kid to help with alergies, i passed out in science class
[14:42:59] <robertmaxrees> i'll believe it.
[14:57:26] <taplar> but i could breath, :D
[14:59:22] <GodGinrai> Hey guys, this isn't really a jquery question, but I figured "who would have more experience dealing with IE idiosyncrasies than the jquery community?"
[14:59:39] <GodGinrai> I have an svg on my page, included using an image tag.
[14:59:45] <GodGinrai> it has a set height in css
[14:59:51] <GodGinrai> and no set width
[15:00:06] <GodGinrai> encompassing that is an anchor tag, which is in a div
[15:00:39] <GodGinrai> somehow, in IE11, these containers for the image are getting set to 40px by the browser
[15:00:44] <GodGinrai> for no good reason
[15:00:46] <GodGinrai> (for the width)
[15:01:15] <GodGinrai> Anyone seen something like this before? (where in IE11, the containers are not respecting the width of their children?)
[15:05:17] <taplar> none of the elements have an position css rule do they?
[15:12:58] <audio> anyone hiring? https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/55uw8d/for_hire_midlevel_pythondjango_developer_looking/
[15:13:10] <robertmaxrees> wrong place to ask ;)
[15:14:30] <audio> :c
[15:17:40] <GodGinrai> taplar: no
[15:22:31] <gambl0re> what testing lib is this https://gist.github.com/rickywid/dfbb4bdf0294b4d26c8857f0377c96ee
[15:23:06] <hellyeah> wondering
[15:23:08] <robertmaxrees> chai maybe.
[15:23:24] <hellyeah> is there a method for getting all css rules of certain element in jqueery?
[15:25:37] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah not really?  that's a strange thing to want.
[15:26:20] <robertmaxrees> do you really want ALL CSS rules?
[15:27:52] <hellyeah> well i would like to get, for example, color, font-size, font-weight, font-family etc.
[15:27:58] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:29:34] <hellyeah> well it is just for study purposes also i will do web scraping not sure it is related tho. My friend said it may be related so better get those
[15:29:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:29:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery woudln't be a good tool for that.
[15:30:03] <robertmaxrees> really no need to use jquery if you're running a scraper anyway.
[15:33:58] <GodGinrai> hellyeah: you want all of the css for a particular element?  Or just the inline styles?
[15:36:35] <hellyeah> all css rules for particular element
[15:36:51] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  we are just learning
[15:37:18] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  me and friend want to write smt from scratch for experience
[15:37:24] <robertmaxrees> i know.
[15:37:28] <robertmaxrees> you'd talked about it before.
[15:37:33] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use jquery in your case.
[15:37:36] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  you can write jquery/js in phantomJS
[15:37:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:37:46] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  what is your suggestion?
[15:37:46] <robertmaxrees> i know what you can do with phantom.
[15:37:50] <robertmaxrees> don't use jquery.
[15:37:59] <robertmaxrees> you don't really need it.
[15:38:02] <hellyeah> i am open minded
[15:38:09] <hellyeah> why should i use?
[15:38:16] <robertmaxrees> the native DOM api.
[15:38:55] <hellyeah> humm
[15:39:28] <hellyeah> you mean the api that web site offer to you?
[15:39:36] <robertmaxrees> i mean the stuff built in to the browser.
[15:39:43] <hellyeah> ah
[15:39:50] <hellyeah> i dont know those actually
[15:39:54] <robertmaxrees> great time to learn :)
[15:39:59] <GodGinrai> hellyeah: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle
[15:40:11] <robertmaxrees> ^ this is one of those cases where the native DOM api is what you want.
[15:40:13] <hellyeah> sure
[15:40:27] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  any link?
[15:40:35] <robertmaxrees> to...?
[15:40:59] <hellyeah> native dom api :D
[15:41:08] <GodGinrai> ...
[15:41:18] <hellyeah> i will find
[15:41:22] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/API
[15:41:25] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
[15:41:37] <GodGinrai> hellyeah: I pasted a link to the particular function you'd want
[15:42:11] <hellyeah> GodGinrai:  it is on my browser
[15:42:17] <hellyeah> GodGinrai:  thank you
[15:42:21] <GodGinrai> np
[15:42:51] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  did you mean plain js? hum
[15:42:59] <robertmaxrees> i mean don't use jquery.
[15:43:03] <hellyeah> ic
[15:43:10] <robertmaxrees> no need to use it if you're targeting one fairly modern browser.
[15:43:38] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  because jquery is not design for that type of task
[15:43:40] <hellyeah> ?
[15:44:07] <robertmaxrees> because you don't need it.
[15:44:23] <robertmaxrees> the native dom api will give you more than enough to work with.
[15:44:52] <hellyeah> ic
[15:45:00] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  thank for that
[15:45:16] <hellyeah> i am just investigating the option what might be
[15:45:21] <hellyeah> appreciated
[15:45:32] <robertmaxrees> if you're looking to learn, you don't need jquery
[15:45:38] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) that's what you should learn first ;)
[15:46:30] <hellyeah> well
[15:46:43] <hellyeah> learning is life long process and never ends :p
[15:46:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:47:04] <robertmaxrees> sure, but you don't really need to know how to make methamphetamine ;)
[15:47:42] <hellyeah> :D
[15:47:50] <taplar> you apparently don't live close to me
[15:47:59] <GodGinrai> XD
[15:48:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:49:27] <taplar> i'd be surprised if there weren't places that had fondu night.... but without the fondu
[15:49:58] <robertmaxrees> i know that exists near me.
[15:50:03] <hellyeah> who didnt live close to you?
[15:50:06] <robertmaxrees> me.
[15:50:29] <robertmaxrees> taplar one of CA's "meth capitals" is like 30 minutes away from me.
[15:50:32] <hellyeah> what is that ondu thing?
[15:50:42] <hellyeah> ah really
[15:50:48] <hellyeah> you guys hanged out?
[15:50:50] <taplar> fondu?  melted cheeses used for dipping
[15:50:54] <taplar> or chocolate
[15:50:56] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah no...
[15:51:02] <taplar> really it's the whole dipping thing i guess.
[15:51:10] <GodGinrai> doesn't that have an E at the end?
[15:51:14] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  why not :D
[15:51:29] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah huh?
[15:51:31] <taplar> *shrug* my spelleng is bad
[15:51:33] <hellyeah> nevermind
[15:51:34] <GodGinrai> lol
[15:51:40] <robertmaxrees> so confused.
[15:51:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:51:43] <hellyeah> spelleng must be german word
[15:51:44] <hellyeah> ahahaha
[15:51:53] <robertmaxrees> close.
[15:51:57] <robertmaxrees> french, swiss, and italian iirc.
[15:52:09] <hellyeah> spelleng is same in those language
[15:52:14] <hellyeah> ?
[15:52:46] <robertmaxrees> italian is fonduta
[15:53:18] <robertmaxrees> "swiss" isn't a language
[15:53:24] <taplar> lol
[15:53:28] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:53:33] <GodGinrai> it's a cheese
[15:53:34] <GodGinrai> duh
[15:53:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:53:43] <taplar> i have a strange viseral need to argue that
[15:53:52] <robertmaxrees> that swiss isn't a language?
[15:53:59] <taplar> just for siggles
[15:54:05] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:54:22] <taplar> *shiggles
[15:54:23] <hellyeah> swiss
[15:54:25] <hellyeah> girl
[15:54:27] <robertmaxrees> Well ACTUALLY there are likely swiss dialects of french, italian, and german, blah blah blah.
[15:54:30] <hellyeah> i like swiss girl
[15:54:51] <taplar> you like holes in your girls?!?!

[15:56:11] <robertmaxrees> "swiss" would e the demonym hellyeah
[15:56:37] <robertmaxrees> kind of like "American" is the demonym for people from the US and "German" is the demonym for people from Germany, etc.
[15:56:57] <taplar> i thought ours was "Fat" ?
[15:56:59] <hellyeah> ic
[15:57:01] <GodGinrai> taplar: yes

[15:58:10] <GodGinrai> robertmaxrees: ++taplar
[15:58:21] <GodGinrai> robertmaxrees: what's the point of increasing him *after* viewing? :P
[15:58:30] <taplar> i'm mutable
[15:58:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:02:16] * taplar wonders if he doesn't talk for a bit if they'll think he was also muteable
[16:02:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:02:38] <taplar> i was going to say i wasn't but someone might prove me wrong
[16:02:49] * taplar eyes shoky
[16:12:17] <taplar> GodGinrai: i think that picture accurately portrays my brain
[16:12:32] <taplar> portrays?  depicts!
[16:12:47] <taplar> see what i mean
[16:18:03] <neilpdx> does anyone here use jqueryui?  i'm looking for a widget that looks like a bar and expands out a table of data below it. when you click on either a plus symbol or just the bar itself.  and clicking the bar again will collapse the table back upwards
[16:18:25] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want a tooltip?
[16:21:48] <taplar> or maybe like a menu thing?
[16:23:28] <taplar> may not be a widget for that.  might just be some element with a part that scrolls up and down upon interaction
[16:23:35] <robertmaxrees> or maybe an accordion?
[16:23:42] <taplar> but a single panel
[16:24:11] <taplar> *shrug*
[16:24:27] <^Lestat2> I figured how to .load(url) into modeal-body, but I want to do it with a popover instead
[16:24:59] <neilpdx> accordion!
[16:25:01] <neilpdx> thank you!
[16:25:19] <neilpdx> robert you did it again!
[16:25:32] * taplar queues britney
[16:25:33] <^Lestat2> This is what I have so far... http://pastebin.com/B7B4B2R6
[16:28:08] <taplar> what plugin is that popover() method from?
[16:28:38] <^Lestat2> bootstrap
[16:28:59] <^Lestat2> Im terrible with js
[16:29:46] <GodGinrai> taplar: lol
[16:30:38] <taplar> ^Lestat2: you may have to stick that popover initialization in the success method of an ajax call to get the content
[16:30:49] <taplar> does not look like it is inherently ajaxed
[16:31:50] <taplar> though, if you know your going to retrieve it when you load the page, not sure why you wouldn't include it on the page already
[16:34:11] <^Lestat2> Can I load a data-content="a bunch of html" ?
[16:34:30] <^Lestat2> a table per se
[16:34:43] <taplar> sure, but load() wouldn't be used for that
[16:34:48] <^Lestat2> Kinda makes readablity of my code tough
[16:35:45] <^Lestat2> I have the data on the page load, so it kinda didnt make sense to go fetch it.
[16:36:02] <^Lestat2> But I wasnt sure how to store it in the script
[16:36:17] <taplar> wait, you already have the content that you want to put in the popover?
[16:36:30] <^Lestat2> The data is available to me
[16:36:48] <taplar> oh, ok, then just select it and stick it in that content: <here> like you have
[16:37:01] <^Lestat2> ah, and as a table too?
[16:37:14] <taplar> whatever content should appear in the popover
[16:37:43] <taplar> content: $(theSelector).html()  or .prop('outerHTML')
[16:38:09] <^Lestat2> This just seems like a lot to put in data-content http://prntscr.com/cpvfoi
[16:39:07] <taplar> so stick it on your page inbetween a <script type="text/html" id="popover-content">...</script>
[16:39:19] <taplar> then content: $('#popover-content').html()
[16:40:34] <^Lestat2> foreach row?
[16:40:40] <taplar> the whole table
[16:40:49] <taplar> that's what you want in the popover right?
[16:41:28] <^Lestat2> well, I have a table of material totals, then click on the material shows a breakdown of that rows material http://prntscr.com/cpvh8i
[16:42:05] <^Lestat2> I suppose I should have asked if lightshot is permitted inhere
[16:42:15] <robertmaxrees> lightshot's ok.
[16:42:22] <^Lestat2> ty ;)
[16:42:22] <robertmaxrees> but your question's kind of confusing.
[16:42:32] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing to handle that today?
[16:42:56] <^Lestat2> I want to click on button (or text), and have a table of data in the popover.
[16:43:20] <^Lestat2> I have the table of data available on page load, but I just dont show it.
[16:43:30] <robertmaxrees> i thought you already had this all working in a modal or something.
[16:43:41] <^Lestat2> I did, I just decided the nodal wasnt pretty ;)
[16:43:46] <^Lestat2> *modal
[16:43:52] <robertmaxrees> right, so you'd apply the same logic to the popover.
[16:45:16] <^Lestat2> Thought since I was here, however, ask a better way that could display the attional table data witout running a query onclick.
[16:45:35] <^Lestat2> because I have the additional table data on page load, its all in one fat array()
[16:45:50] <robertmaxrees> how much data are you talking?
[16:46:20] <^Lestat2> like 10 rows
[16:46:25] <^Lestat2> for each entry
[16:46:31] <^Lestat2> some more, some less.
[16:46:44] <robertmaxrees> lol so much much data are you talking?
[16:46:54] <robertmaxrees> "10 rows for each entry" with how many entries?
[16:47:09] <robertmaxrees> i ask because it might make more sense to let your backend handle the data crunching.
[16:47:22] <^Lestat2> dynamically I guess. Could be as many as 100 master rows. If you have flash, this is what the modal  looks like http://www.screencast.com/t/IjcpZtKUeVUl
[16:47:43] <robertmaxrees> right, so with that much data, i'd just let your backend do its thing.
[16:48:10] <^Lestat2> Good point. I never considered what happens when ppl pull 3 months of data
[16:48:18] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:49:01] <^Lestat2> Usually, I just need to work that out by talkin bout it. That makes sense to run the query ;D
[16:49:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, rubber duck debugging :)
[16:49:35] <^Lestat2> hehe
[17:05:29] <GodGinrai> robertmaxrees: if only that worked for IE bugs
[17:05:52] <robertmaxrees> *old IE bugs.
[17:06:04] <robertmaxrees> IE11 + Edge are actually pretty decent ;)
[17:08:04] <seemikehack> Hey all. It seems as though jQuery UI is going through one of my pages and trying to enable some styling on links that I never asked for, or at least am not aware that I did. Specifically, it's taking links and giving them a bunch of ui classes, .ui-button and .ui-widget and. I don't have an MVP, I don't expect miracles, I just want to know if anyone has had a similar experience that might point me in the right direction. I have no idea on
[17:08:05] <seemikehack> where to start with this.
[17:09:37] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're not opting in?
[17:10:12] <GodGinrai> robertmaxrees: I thought that until I started dealing with these svg issues, man
[17:10:22] <GodGinrai> robertmaxrees: Now I'm about ready to toss my laptop
[17:17:59] <seemikehack> robertmaxrees, I might be, right now I'm digging through the initialization methods that are called on the page to see if I'm inadvertently triggering this thing.
[17:18:09] <robertmaxrees> that might do it then.
[17:19:04] <seemikehack> robertmaxrees, it really seems like I have to be, but I can't remember anything that even would be doing this. Like I said, figured I'd just pop in on the wild chance that someone had some similar accidental initialization problem.
[17:19:25] <seemikehack> Never hurts to ask, right? :)
[17:19:35] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:37:30] <seemikehack> I think I've got it. The container in which this link weirdness is happening is a div.radio, which jQuery UI is picking up and converting to a buttonset; apparently part of that is mucking with links. Trying to figure out where that's getting initialized and how to exclude elements.
[17:39:38] <seemikehack> Found where it's getting initialized, now to configure it...maybe.
[17:44:27] <alexander25> hi everyone, can anyone point me why his fails :   $( document ).on("click", "#search #degree input:checkbox", ':not(#tag)', function(){
[17:44:46] <alexander25> im trying to exclude a div
[17:44:50] <robertmaxrees> "#search #degree input:checkbox", ':not(#tag)'
[17:45:03] <robertmaxrees> you can't pass two args there.
[17:45:08] <robertmaxrees> needs to be on selector.
[17:45:15] <robertmaxrees> which div are you excluding?
[17:45:28] <robertmaxrees> also, multiple IDs in a selector like that is a no-no.  you only need on
[17:45:34] <robertmaxrees> *one
[17:46:30] <alexander25> or   $("#search :input").on('click', ':not(#tag)', function (e) { fails also
[17:46:43] <alexander25> robertmaxrees  im excluding the #tag div
[17:46:53] <robertmaxrees> so you want everyhing BUT a specific element?
[17:47:03] <alexander25> which is inside the #search div and contains a texfield
[17:47:16] <alexander25> that textfield inside #tag should be excluded yes
[17:47:46] <robertmaxrees> you could always just check inside the handler.
[17:48:57] <seemikehack> robertmaxrees, done and done :) thanks for being my sounding board. I did that to one of my colleagues earlier. I should just start talking out loud to myself.
[17:49:19] <robertmaxrees> alexander25 otherwiuse you wind up needing to feed a full selector to :not()
[17:49:26] <robertmaxrees> seemikehack rubber duck debugging :) glad to be here.
[17:49:31] <robertmaxrees> and help.
[17:50:34] <alexander25> robertmaxrees don't think i fully understand could you please explain your suggestion?
[17:50:46] <robertmaxrees> alexander25 which suggestion? :)
[17:51:05] <robertmaxrees> because tbh i'd just stick a check inside your handler.
[17:52:46] <alexander25> ill try to work it out
[17:53:36] <alexander25> using this plugin https://github.com/Pixabay/jQuery-tagEditor it posts tag names like "one", "two" but is there a way to have those values be inside a tags[] value in the post params somehow?
[17:53:57] <alexander25> i try to figure this out this is needed for my backend instead of posting just the values
[17:54:15] <robertmaxrees> why not modify your backend?
[17:54:25] <alexander25> any pointers to what methods one would use to post values in a tags["one","two"] format ?
[17:54:34] <alexander25> robertmaxrees  no that is no possible
[17:54:34] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:54:43] <robertmaxrees> how is that not possible?
[17:55:26] <alexander25> i need it to be in my post paramaters , backend is 3rd party
[17:55:54] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so then how does it post?
[17:56:02] <robertmaxrees> where's the bit that does that for you?
[17:56:09] <alexander25> it seems he plugin just posts the values seperatly but not in a post parameter format if that makes any sense
[17:56:22] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:57:37] <taplar> the rare case that it's not a duck?
[17:57:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:29:37] <taplar> mmm, i think i found some love
[18:29:41] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[18:30:03] <taplar> running our jasmine test on our pipelines takes forever, cause it's recloning each time
[18:30:10] <robertmaxrees> oh cool.
[18:30:17] <taplar> just found the --depth=1 option, which i'm hoping we can use
[18:31:03] <taplar> the pipelines really don't need the full clone of the repo
[20:22:02] <VectorX> whats the alternative to jQuery.browser in 1.9+ ?
[21:14:21] <`slikts> using arrow functions with jquery is really annoying
[21:14:35] <`slikts> since the first argument is not the element
[21:15:14] <`slikts> so it needs to be (_, el) or a normal function
[21:16:22] <acidjazz> so if i change a checkbox
[21:16:30] <acidjazz> via like this.checked = !this.checked
[21:16:35] <acidjazz> the 'change' event doesnt fire
[21:17:22] <acidjazz> i guess i have to fire it myself w/ $(this).change()
[21:17:31] <acidjazz> seemsghetto.jpg
[21:25:20] <BobLobLawBlog> this seemed really cool http://devtipsshow.com/killingitwithjquery/
[22:00:00] <acidjazz> man BobLobLawBlog  stop promoting crap on irc
[22:00:04] <acidjazz> how low are you
[22:00:44] <BobLobLawBlog> what dude someone in here told me about that... lol I had to check if this was #jquery when u said that
[22:01:03] <acidjazz> i remember that being you
[22:01:32] <BobLobLawBlog> someone who was helping me with jquery told me about it, seems legit
[22:02:23] <BobLobLawBlog> lol so dead in here, making drama just to talk are you.
[22:08:36] <acidjazz> no ijust know you're promoting that
[22:08:45] <acidjazz> wondering if you're travis himself
[22:08:59] <acidjazz> ive seen you dump that crap in other channels
[22:22:15] <Darmani> Hey guys, I'm trying to get a button to turn red (and stay red even if the page refreshes) if a user has clicked on it before.
[22:22:20] <Darmani> how2dothis.jpg
[22:22:36] <acidjazz> well once hte page is refreshed the state is gone
[22:22:48] <acidjazz> so you have a couple choices, one is a cookie
[22:22:51] <acidjazz> another is altering the URL
[22:23:23] <Darmani> acidjazz: hmm I don't want to alter the url so I guess a cookie will have to do.
[22:23:36] <Darmani> I haven't used that before though so I guess that will take some research haha
[22:23:39] <acidjazz> just remember to clean up and accomodate for using that in the future
[22:23:48] <acidjazz> sure
[22:24:09] <Darmani> acidjazz: thanks though ^^
[22:24:59] <Darmani> acidjazz: Is there a way I could do it through a user_session perhaps?
[22:26:19] <BobLobLawBlog> lol that dude works at google so im flattered
[22:55:20] <acidjazz> HMM
[22:55:50] <acidjazz> i need to loop through ajax calls, and not let the next one fire until the previous one is complete
[22:59:40] <taplar> sounds like some sort of recursive binding to the ajax deferreds
[23:38:55] <acidjazz> well its an array of urls righ tnow
[23:38:57] <acidjazz> right now*
[23:39:13] <acidjazz> and i want to walk through them firing off the next when the current is complete
[23:39:23] <acidjazz> waddya mean teh ajax deferreds
[23:39:38] <taplar> $.ajax() returns a deferred, right?
[23:40:17] <acidjazz> so i can like... .deferred.then()
[23:40:34] <acidjazz> $.get.always().done().fail().defererd.then() ?
[23:40:51] <taplar> not the .deferred, but yeah
[23:41:00] <taplar> and $.get()
[23:41:28] <acidjazz> right.. so just .then() ?
[23:41:39] <taplar> one sec
[23:42:00] <acidjazz> i see
[23:42:03] <acidjazz> thanks taplar  much appreciated
[23:44:40] <taplar> something along the lines of this: https://jsfiddle.net/Logsuvgp/
[23:45:51] <acidjazz> so you're just firing off a completion when all the gets are done
[23:45:59] <acidjazz> but see i dont want to fire off all the gets at once
[23:46:02] <acidjazz> i want to walk through each one
[23:46:05] <acidjazz> not firing the second until the 1st is done
[23:46:10] <acidjazz> so i error and stop properly
[23:46:14] <taplar> no, it fires the first one, and attaches the next one to fire when it is done
[23:46:32] <acidjazz> i see. thast your .then()
[23:46:32] <acidjazz> ok
[23:46:34] <taplar> which recursively repeats
[23:48:46] <acidjazz> ok so next question, if my .get.fail() fires
[23:48:50] <acidjazz> will .then still fire?
[23:48:59] <taplar> no, it would die as it is
[23:49:20] <taplar> technically the then would fire, but it would execute the second argument, of which there currently is not one
[23:51:30] <acidjazz> hmm
[23:51:37] <acidjazz> what about a way to control if it fires?
[23:51:50] <taplar> what do you mean?
[23:51:50] <acidjazz> what if i had a method wrapped w/in the .get that fired a callback w/ true/false
[23:52:36] <taplar> oh, if i understand you, that could be done with another deferred
[23:52:41] <taplar> one sec
[23:52:46] <acidjazz> thanks :)
[23:55:22] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1c4s05d4/
[23:55:57] <taplar> you can do something like that if you want.
[23:57:07] <acidjazz> crazy
[23:57:08] <acidjazz> thanks
[23:57:21] <taplar> np, :)
