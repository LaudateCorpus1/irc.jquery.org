[00:00:03] <Xotix> Is this a correct plugin structure? http://pastie.org/3772676
[00:00:20] <Cork> Hippie: you need to wait for dom ready $(function() {}); or $(document).ready(function() {});
[00:01:24] <Hippie> Cork, do you perhaps have a link on that? Not sure what you mean :)
[00:01:34] <Whirl3d> Hereisanotherlie, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5yLkU/18/
[00:03:23] <Cork> Xotix: no that shouldnät even parse
[00:03:41] <Hereisanotherlie> Whirl3d: mainBlurb.fadeOut('fast',function () {txt.fadeIn('slow')}); <- do the curly brackets make it wait for the fadeOut to complete before starting the fadeIn ?
[00:03:50] <Cork> Xotix: you sould use (function($) {})(jQuery) not ready
[00:03:59] <Cork> Xotix: http://pastey.org/356y2
[00:03:59] <Cork> [2012-04-12 07:58:42] * shakakai (~s
[00:04:01] <Cork> bah...
[00:04:09] <Cork> scratch that :/
[00:04:14] <Xotix> Cork why? thought function is just a shortcut for ready
[00:04:27] <Xotix> it works btw (not the post of course)
[00:04:29] <Cork> Xotix: $() is not ()(jQuery)
[00:04:43] <Cork> its a scop wrapper
[00:04:47] <Cork> *scope
[00:05:08] <Whirl3d> Fadein/fadeout use the structure:   $(elem).fadeIn("duration",callback)...the callback function is where you see the curly brackets...its part of the function () {} used
[00:05:32] <Cork> Hippie: just wrapp your inline code in one of those functions
[00:05:44] <Xotix> Cork i see the mistake but why shouldn't it parse?
[00:05:51] <Hereisanotherlie> oh man that makes so much sense, thanks Whirl3d
[00:05:57] <Cork> function()() <--
[00:06:12] <Cork> you have two pare of paranteses after a funciton name
[00:06:44] <Cork> or to be presice .ready()()
[00:07:20] <Xotix> Cork, so?
[00:07:21] <Whirl3d> Hereisanotherlie, here is the same thing with comments: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5yLkU/20/
[00:07:43] <Cork> ?eval function test() { return 1; }; test()();
[00:07:47] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: test() is not a function
[00:07:54] <Hippie> Whirl3d, can you maybe help me quick?
[00:07:56] <Xotix> Cork that's different
[00:08:01] <Cork> no
[00:08:06] <Cork> thats exactly what your doing
[00:08:51] <Cork> ?eval var $ = { ready: function() { return 1; } }; $.ready()()
[00:08:52] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: $.ready() is not a function
[00:08:53] <Xotix> hm, ur right, anyway, it doesn't throw an error
[00:09:17] <Whirl3d> Hippie, try jsfiddle. it's a lot better for testing things like this out. But at first glance, yes it should work.
[00:09:48] <Whirl3d> You will just need to put it inthe $(document).ready(function () { your script goes here});
[00:10:00] <Cork> Xotix: it might give you an error but its broken and won't give the expected result
[00:10:06] <Cork> *might not give you
[00:10:23] <Cork> plugins arn't interested in dom ready
[00:10:28] <Whirl3d> otherwise, your script runs, looks for li.wee and because the dom isn't ready, it can't find it, so it never binds the hover event.
[00:10:31] <Cork> (normally)
[00:11:48] <Xotix> Cork yeah, ur right but using () on a function statement (function(msg)("hi")) sould work?
[00:12:16] <Cork> (function(msg){}("hi")) or (function(msg){})("hi") works yes
[00:12:36] <Xotix> yeah of course, forgot  the {}
[00:13:07] <Cork> it basically creates a function and executes it immediately
[00:13:21] <Cork> normally called closure or scoping
[00:13:26] <Xotix> so () always "refers" to the last anonymouse function?
[00:13:44] <Wildbat> hi all, is it possible to make checkbox to be readonly?
[00:13:46] <Cork> no it referes to the function call
[00:14:11] <Cork> (function() {})() is the same as var tmp = function() {}; tmp();
[00:14:24] <Whirl3d> Wildbat, are you using html5? if so, add the "readonly" attribute to your checkbox input
[00:14:41] <Whirl3d> if not, you can disable the checkbox element and it can't be changed
[00:14:46] <Whirl3d> *by the user
[00:15:05] <Xotix> Cork yes i got that but why function call? isn't it the function call? I'm jsut hanging me up on words now. :)
[00:15:40] <Cork> Xotix: not sure what your asking now
[00:15:51] <Cork> you mean is () a function call?
[00:15:59] <Wildbat> Whirl3d, if not?:)
[00:16:06] <Xotix> Cork defined function call
[00:16:37] <Cork> a function call is when your calling a function name or a variable that points to a function
[00:16:59] <Cork> function name() {}; name is a reference name() is a call
[00:17:23] <Whirl3d> wildbat, keep reading...if not, you set the disabled attribute to disabled on the input element.
[00:18:37] <Xotix> Cork ok thanks
[00:18:43] <Hippie> Can someone tell me why its not working ? http://pastey.org/358y2
[00:19:19] <Wildbat> Whirl3d, Ar! sorry ~ :) my network is a bit laggy :) thanks i will try that
[00:19:35] <Cork> Hippie: please use a site that allow you to use live code
[00:19:42] <Cork> Hippie: not static code dumps
[00:19:52] <Cork> ?p @ Hippie
[00:19:53] <bot-t> Hippie, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:20:16] <Whirl3d> Like I said earlier, Hippie. Cork++
[00:20:40] <Whirl3d> I gotta remember the ? p thing..
[00:21:17] <Whirl3d> Wildbat, np
[00:21:27] <Cork> should prob add http://webdevout.net/test in there
[00:22:16] <Whirl3d> I dunno know. Webdevout doesn't have explicit jquery support, does it?
[00:22:23] <Cork> nope
[00:22:53] <Cork> but it allows you to change the entire content of the html
[00:23:07] <Cork> so all thats needed is to add the script tag
[00:23:12] <Whirl3d> imo, only sandboxes that have explicit support for jquery should be used. But I see your point...
[00:23:41] <Cork> as long as you can actually run the code i don't care
[00:23:56] <Cork> doesn't mean i think of it as a favorit though
[00:24:03] <Cork> but jsfiddle is damn slow sometimes
[00:24:06] <Hippie> Sigh in JSFiddle it works but not my firefox
[00:24:39] <Cork> Hippie: so its something about how your site then
[00:24:58] <Hippie> how my site what? lol
[00:24:58] <Whirl3d> wait, I don't get you. jsFiddle and Firefox are not mutually exclusive. So does it run in firefox on jsfiddle?
[00:25:08] <Hippie> Yes
[00:25:30] <Hippie> I think it has to do with the "wrap" on the left
[00:25:38] <Hippie> http://jsfiddle.net/GJ7Hv/
[00:26:29] <Whirl3d> if all you are trying to do is to style your elements on hover, I'd use CSS...add the :hover pseudo class and you are set
[00:26:39] <Whirl3d> no js/jquery needed
[00:27:00] <Hippie> Whirl3d, I'm actually using the code for nav.  That is just a simplified version
[00:27:09] <raj> it's so sad when I have to write myself reminders to make a sandwich at some point
[00:27:21] <Cork> lol
[00:27:46] <raj> I love working on this webpage so much, it's unhealthy
[00:27:54] <Whirl3d> you might also want to select the jquery framework for your fiddle.
[00:28:11] <Whirl3d> Though it seems to work regardless, huh?
[00:28:12] <Hippie> I did
[00:28:30] <Whirl3d> must be me. It says mootools on mine. Weird.
[00:28:42] <Whirl3d> *Wierd
[00:28:43] <coldhead> its nice you're having fun with it, raj
[00:28:58] <coldhead> you've come a long way very quickly as the actress said to the bishop
[00:29:37] <raj> i know, you three + Eviltwin have been there since I climbed out the womb
[00:29:55] <coldhead> it's no thanks to me, i wanted to have you banned from the channel
[00:30:09] <coldhead> but EvilTwin was like "no, he reminds me of a young me"
[00:30:16] <raj> hahaha
[00:30:16] <coldhead> "let me stay"
[00:30:31] <Whirl3d> coldhead you are a laugh riot.
[00:30:35] <raj> god damn this 'raj' fella, with his thousands of questions
[00:30:43] <Hippie> Whirl3d, rookie error.  Just had to download jQuery and reff locally instead of using goole servers
[00:31:24] <fRAiLtY-> Morning, http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/delivery I'm having issues with qtip. I've included jQuery (header) and set it in noConflict mode. I've also included the qtip js file before </body> and also initialised it just below the include, as the instructions say. It doesn't seem to work though, which is odd?
[00:33:52] <fRAiLtY-> Logically though, it's not going to work if the content it's trying to manipulate is before the include… right?
[00:34:18] <Hereisanotherlie> Whirl3d: thanks again, you really helped me out a lot. I'm customizing it further now based off your help
[00:34:49] <Whirl3d> Cool. Glad to hear it.
[00:34:55] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: yes
[00:35:16] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the script needs to be loaded before you try to use it
[00:37:53] <raj> i've got `function ajaxCallback(data)` where data = {'image_data':[{'name':'image1'},{'name':'anotherimg'}], 'currentuser_data':{'username':'bro','permissions':['view','auth']}] ... and I'd like to store the 'currentuser_data' object in a function, so I can just call `currentUser()` and it returns currentuser_data... such as `function currentUser() return data['currentuser_data']`. But I want this function to be outside of ajaxCallback so I can call it ...
[00:37:59] <raj> ... from any other function
[00:38:02] <raj> how can I do that?
[00:38:44] <Cork> window.last_data = data;
[00:39:07] <raj> oh, so it has to be a global variable, no way to do that
[00:39:11] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/skin/frontend/default/helloboginya/js/jquery.qtip.min.js because I'm running jQuery in noConflict (using jQuery instead of $) do I need to replace all the $'s in that file with jQuery? as it's still not working.. or erroring
[00:39:57] <Cork> uh... do you have a none minmized version?
[00:40:33] <raj> oops,, so it has to be a global variable, no way to do that otherwise as a function?
[00:41:34] <Cork> raj: (function() { var my_hidden_data; window.do_ajax() { $.ajax().success(function() { my_hidden_data = data; }); } })()
[00:41:49] <Cork> bah... WRONG :/
[00:41:59] <Cork> one sec and i'll create a fiddle
[00:42:08] <raj> gracias Cork
[00:44:22] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/gxyxz/
[00:44:33] <Whirl3d> Here's what I try to do, just for perspective: I try to look back at the logs from IRC and for every line that I request help, I make sure to provide help for at least the same number of lines if possible. It's a weird habit I picked up on Ultrashock.
[00:44:40] <Cork> though you have to make sure the ajax is complete before you use currentUser
[00:44:53] <Cork> else the variable will be empty
[00:45:16] <raj> does this seem like a bad idea to you?
[00:45:24] <Cork> Whirl3d: wow thats ambitional!
[00:45:33] <raj> don't hold back, i can take it
[00:45:39] <Cork> raj: depends, sometimes its nessesary
[00:45:42] <Whirl3d> Are you saying I ask for lots of help? LOL
[00:45:57] <Cork> but ya, normally its better to use callbacks instead
[00:46:09] <Whirl3d> Cork, your ratio is about 20000:1 help provided:help requested
[00:46:29] <Cork> Whirl3d: it means try to help if you can, but don't feel it as a must
[00:46:49] <Cork> its better to have a feeling of wanting to do it, instead of forced to
[00:47:03] <Whirl3d> force of habit, really I love to help when I can.
[00:47:44] <Whirl3d> I just don't see how you keep from getting burnt out on it. Especially when you are trying to help and someone wants to argue/complain/etc.
[00:48:09] <Cork> well is sit and code 8+h a day
[00:48:17] <Cork> this is what keeps me sain :D
[00:48:36] <Cork> but ya, i puts the channel away from time to time when its getting to be too much
[00:48:46] <Whirl3d> 8+ hours a day writing code. I can't imagine that.
[00:48:55] <Cork> its called work :D
[00:49:25] <Cork> and i'm a bit of a nerd, so i like it... so i do it on my free time too >_>
[00:49:26] <Flo0815> good morning guys
[00:49:30] <Whirl3d> I mean, I'll spend 12+ hours a day working on learning this stuff, but I'm not getting paid.
[00:50:08] <Whirl3d> But 99% of my time is spent chasing my tail, really. Refactoring things that don't need it.
[00:50:29] <raj> Cork, how is extending window any different than giving it the arbitrary .last_data property, as you originally suggested?
[00:50:46] <Cork> raj: its not
[00:50:46] <NickASloan> the .on does not seem to work with HTML5 video events. any thoughts on this?
[00:50:52] <Cork> except the data isn't on windows
[00:50:52] <raj> oh ok
[00:50:58] <Cork> the global functions are
[00:50:58] <NickASloan> nor does .live
[00:51:04] <NickASloan> .bind did seem to work though
[00:51:08] <raj> the global functions are on windows?
[00:51:08] <Cork> raj: the data is private
[00:51:12] <raj> oh
[00:51:13] <raj> i see
[00:51:45] <Flo0815> so i got another thing i need your help. I have a inputfield where a user types in a string which he wants to search in the database. The searchquery is sent via ajax after each keypress. So, if the user types in a string with 3 letters and the query for the first keypress takes longer than the query for the third letter, the result for the 3letterstring will be overwritten. How can i prevent
[00:51:45] <Flo0815> this?
[00:51:55] <Cork> that also means nothing beside those two functions can modify that variable
[00:51:58] <Cork> raj: ^
[00:52:20] <raj> Cork, is this doing an extra ajax request?
[00:52:35] <raj> cuz I ws trying to utilize the ajax request I was already doing
[00:52:35] <Whirl3d> Is there a succinct reference to jquery like there is for php? One that shows the method nomenclature and various arguments/events handled/etc. ?
[00:52:46] <Cork> Whirl3d: my contact with jquery was from prototype/scriptalus => drupal with jquery 1 => heaven :D
[00:52:49] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Unminified http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/skin/frontend/default/helloboginya/js/jquery.qtip.js
[00:53:26] <Cork> raj: no you would have to use the do_ajax function to do your ajax call
[00:53:36] <Cork> raj: thought it isn't completed, just a place holder
[00:53:42] <raj> oh
[00:53:46] <raj> I see
[00:53:46] <raj> hmm
[00:53:54] <raj> that would require a whole lot of changes to my code I think
[00:54:08] <Cork> raj: but it should be farly simple to use it as a wrapper around ajax
[00:54:10] <NickASloan> then again, click on the video element is working just fine
[00:54:44] <Whirl3d> NickASloan, it sounds like you need a list of methods handled by 'on'...I would look at the api for that.
[00:54:53] <raj> Cork, what's that mean?
[00:54:55] <Cork> function do_ajax() { return $.ajax.apply(null, arguments); }
[00:55:02] <Whirl3d> *events, not methods
[00:55:13] <Cork> raj: then you just use do_ajax instead of $.ajax
[00:55:30] <raj> I use $.post and $.get everywhere
[00:55:53] <Cork> so use that instead
[00:56:44] <raj> ok, dabbling with my code, let's see
[00:58:47] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I replaced all $ with jQuery but still no luck, no errors either :x
[00:59:04] <Cork> oh sorry haven't checked the file yet
[00:59:11] <fRAiLtY-> No probs, just thought I'd give it a try
[00:59:17] <fRAiLtY-> Unminified http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/skin/frontend/default/helloboginya/js/jquery.qtip.js
[00:59:38] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: can you restore it to its original state?
[00:59:42] <subdesign> hi
[00:59:45] <fRAiLtY-> Sure, 2 secs
[01:00:00] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: refresh it
[01:00:39] <fRAiLtY-> The only other thing I can guess it that it bundles with 1.5, but I use 1.7.. potentially an issue?
[01:02:08] <NickASloan> Whirl3d: I just tested an event I made up called "blah" and fired it with .trigger
[01:02:14] <NickASloan> I guess chrome is not firing the play event
[01:02:46] <Whirl3d> trigger is different than native handled bubbled events.
[01:02:47] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: interesting
[01:02:55] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Go on..
[01:03:03] <Cork> thats the first time i've seen the AMD section
[01:03:17] <Cork> anyway yes, that file should support noConflict just fine
[01:03:30] <fRAiLtY-> So, I should change all $ to jQuery, yes?
[01:03:38] <Cork> no, just leave it
[01:04:11] <Whirl3d> NickASloan, if you can get your html5 element to trigger a custom event on itself, you can grab the event with on. But natively, you need to know which events are automagically propogated for use with .on
[01:04:19] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: line 18-27 handels that
[01:04:38] <fRAiLtY-> So, could it be the jQuery version causing it not to work?
[01:04:47] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/delivery#
[01:04:49] <Whirl3d> you might be able to get different results using delegate and/or bind.
[01:04:54] <Cork> depends on what error your getting
[01:05:01] <fRAiLtY-> On that page I have a link which should qtip.
[01:05:15] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I'm not getting any errors, not related to that file anyway. Getting 1 error for another js file
[01:05:39] <NickASloan> Whirl3d: where do I look this up? in the code itself?
[01:06:41] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the crash in cycle stops the js execution
[01:06:57] <Whirl3d> ?.on @ NickASloan is the best bet that I know of.
[01:07:00] <fRAiLtY-> Ah, so hitting that error means it doesn't load the rest of the code anyway?
[01:07:18] <Cork> it loads, thats already done
[01:07:22] <Turbohao> greetings
[01:07:25] <Cork> but it doesn't execute
[01:07:38] <Whirl3d> bot-t has forsaken me it appears:  http://api.jquery.com/on.html I think...
[01:07:52] <Cork> ?.on @ NickASloan
[01:08:03] <Cork> so it looks like
[01:08:10] <Cork> ?ping
[01:08:16] <Flo0815> is it possible to get a unixtimestamp for an ajax request answer?
[01:08:28] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Couldn't find ".on @ NickASloan is the best bet that I know of." in jQuery Docs.
[01:08:29] <bot-t> NickASloan, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:08:30] <bot-t> Cork: pong!
[01:08:40] <Cork> yikse slooo
[01:08:56] <Cork> Whirl3d: if you want to have comments in your linking use see ?
[01:09:18] <Cork> Whirl3d: like see ?.hide
[01:09:19] <bot-t> Whirl3d, .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[01:09:34] <Whirl3d> see ?.on
[01:09:36] <bot-t> Whirl3d, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:10:01] <Whirl3d> nice. Is there a reference for irc commands that you would suggest reading?
[01:10:12] <Flo0815> hellooo...someone got a hint for me?
[01:10:15] <Cork> ?commands
[01:10:18] <bot-t> http://bot-t.com/docs/
[01:10:31] <Cork> bah... offline
[01:10:59] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I've reverted to 1.5.2 and same error on this sticky float thing, can you tell me what the issue is? It's part of a theme I'm using http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/delivery
[01:11:43] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you need to start commenting out code and see what line causes it
[01:12:08] <Cork> the error happens prob cause your sending something to it thats unexpected
[01:12:28] <Cork> like a dom element where a string is expected or similar
[01:18:47] <fRAiLtY-> Dam thing
[01:19:12] <Cork> ?
[01:20:44] <fRAiLtY-> Seems to be a problem with this sticky float thing
[01:20:50] <fRAiLtY-> It cannot identify "top" of null
[01:21:02] <fRAiLtY-> As it's a purchased skin I'm not sure what elements are using it
[01:22:26] <Kingsy> guys, is anyone aware of how to get fade in and out animations to work on IE ?
[01:22:41] <Kingsy> fadeToggle() doesnt seem to animate in IE, it just displays..
[01:23:25] <Xotix> How do i correctly create a Plugin without dom ready? http://pastie.org/3772926 the upper one uses dome ready and works.  why doesn't the  one below work?
[01:25:52] <NickASloan> Whirl3d: it turns out .bind uses .on
[01:26:38] <NickASloan> instead of the form $(document).on('play', 'video', function(e) { console.log(e); }); which is documented
[01:27:12] <NickASloan> I have to use $('video').on('play', null, function(e) { console.log(e); });
[01:27:39] <Cork> Xotix: uh... 1-7
[01:27:42] <NickASloan> I don't really understand why 'video' for the selector argument doesn't work, but I don't care. At least it's working.
[01:27:47] <Cork> 10-14 is just ... weird
[01:28:14] <NickASloan> I guess perhaps the play event doesn't propagate upward
[01:28:41] <Xotix> Cork, how can i use IIFE without the document ready and why should it be weird?
[01:28:56] <Whirl3d> NickASloan, I wish I had a better grasp of the overall event propogation patterns. I just kind of feel around until I get it. LOL
[01:29:11] <Cork> Xotix: 10-14 will assign what ever the function returns to $.fn.myPlugin
[01:29:31] <Cork> Xotix: and it wouldn't make sure that $.fn is actually jquery
[01:29:35] <lijzz> cork, i want to hide all textboxes with same class name i tried $(".albumview-text").hide(); but its not working
[01:29:52] <Cork> Xotix: and thats the hole point of (function($)(jQuery)
[01:30:02] <Cork> * (function($){})(jQuery)
[01:30:19] <Xotix> Cork you said most plugins don't use dom ready and function($) is a shortut for dom ready isn't it?
[01:30:42] <Cork> lijzz: that should work just find, as long as the textboxes exist when you call that line
[01:31:03] <Cork> sigh... no
[01:31:10] <Cork> like i said last time its not
[01:31:18] <Cork> $(function() {}) os
[01:31:20] <Cork> *is
[01:31:40] <Cork> (function($){})(jQuery) is scoping
[01:32:58] <MacroMan> Is it possible to have a textual link to drop down the options on a drop down, without actually showing the box itself?
[01:33:14] <Cork> not that i know of
[01:33:26] <Xotix> Cork, I'm weird. Thats a correct plugin declaration without dom ready right? jQuery.fn.upload = function() {};
[01:33:29] <Cork> you prob need to generate your own dropdown structure
[01:33:42] <MacroMan> Cork: OK, thanks
[01:33:44] <Cork> Xotix: you need the wrapping
[01:33:52] <Xotix> What wrapping?
[01:33:59] <Cork> ...
[01:34:03] <Cork> ready
[01:34:05] <Cork> *read
[01:34:15] <Cork> i've said it like 5 times
[01:34:27] <Cork> (function($){})(jQuery)
[01:34:40] <MacroMan> Is there a method I can call to drop down a box that is normally visible?
[01:34:54] <Kingsy> nope..  just cant get this to fade.. why is IE always got the problems ??
[01:35:05] <Cork> MacroMan: slideDown()
[01:35:05] <MacroMan> That I could perhaps just hide it behind another DIV
[01:35:16] <MacroMan> Cork, thanks
[01:35:29] <Kingsy> Cork: any advice on this?
[01:35:49] <Cork> Kingsy: ie7 or what?
[01:35:55] <MacroMan> Cork. No, not to display something. To show drop the options in a dropdown down,
[01:35:57] <Kingsy> ie9 at the momoent
[01:36:10] <Xotix> Cork, i quote you "plugins arn't interested in dom ready" what did you mean with that? For me it's saying: Don't use ready for plugins
[01:36:10] <Cork> MacroMan: like i said, you can't create your own
[01:36:20] <Cork> Xotix: and?
[01:36:58] <Xotix> Cork now you are saying i have to use it. I can't use iife to make sure $ is defined without using ready()
[01:37:07] <Cork> "<Cork> like i said last time its not" "<Cork> $(function() {}) is" "cork> (function($){})(jQuery) is scoping"
[01:37:57] <Kingsy> Cork: it doesnt even work in ie9
[01:38:02] <Cork> Xotix: i never have, your skipping selected parts of what i'm tellin you
[01:39:44] <Kingsy> Cork: have you ever had fadeToggle() or something similar working in IE ?
[01:40:19] <Cork> Kingsy: its specifically fadeToggle?
[01:40:22] <Kingsy> any type of animations seems to break in ie as far as I have seen, such as fadeIn, fadeOut, fadeToggle, slideUp, slideDown etc etc
[01:40:22] <Turbohao> i've got an event problem i have a form with 1 iframe when i press the submit button i submit the form in jquery, the iframe get's filled with the response data
[01:40:23] <Xotix> Cork, i'm totally weird now.
[01:41:01] <Cork> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/ucKNm/ works fine here
[01:41:40] <Turbohao> i use the $('iframe').load and execute a function it works great the first time but the second time i press the submit button it executes the function twice
[01:41:49] <Turbohao> and it get's incremented
[01:42:09] <Cork> Kingsy: and so does http://jsfiddle.net/ucKNm/1/
[01:42:37] <Turbohao> anyone an idea what's going wrong?i've tried $('iframe:first') $('iframe:last') but nothing seems to work
[01:43:21] <Turbohao> i have now a var that i set to true whenever i press the submit button and in the function i set it to false
[01:43:23] <Cork> Turbohao: your prob binding the iframe event handler each time?
[01:43:37] <Turbohao> can i avoid it?
[01:43:48] <Turbohao> maybe with bind and unvind?
[01:43:49] <Cork> the iframe isn't replaced so you don't need to bind it more then when the page loads
[01:43:52] <Turbohao> *unbind?
[01:44:27] <Turbohao> i see ok thanks for the info
[01:44:27] <Cork> so bind it when you load the parent page, and just reuse the old event handler
[01:44:44] <Turbohao> i will try that out ty
[01:45:48] <Kingsy> Cork: hmm let me try and js fiddle my example.. see if it breaks
[01:47:36] <Kingsy> Cork: arrgghhh, it works in IE the jsfiddle.. wtf
[01:47:42] <Xotix> Cork, i got my mistake. Isn't this equivalent?  http://pastebin.com/PSg7rAnq
[01:48:19] <Cork> Xotix: no
[01:48:31] <Cork> Jquery.fn.myPlugin...
[01:48:55] <Cork> is the same as
[01:49:14] <Cork> ?eval function gen() { return 1 }; myPlugin = gen(); myPlugin
[01:49:17] <bot-t> Cork: 1
[01:49:43] <Cork> it will contain the return value from the executed function, not a function
[01:50:35] <Cork> ?eval var $ = {}; (function() { $.myPlugin = function() {} })(); $.myPlugin
[01:50:37] <bot-t> Cork: <function () {}>
[01:50:48] <Turbohao> thanks Cork it works perfect :)
[01:50:50] <Cork> ?eval var $ = {}; $.myPlugin = (function() { return 1; })(); $.myPlugin
[01:50:51] <bot-t> Cork: 1
[01:51:24] <Cork> might as well to it this way
[01:51:30] <Cork> ?eval var $ = {}; (function() { $.myPlugin = function() { return 1; } })(); $.myPlugin
[01:51:31] <bot-t> Cork: <function () {return 1;}>
[01:51:51] <Xotix> Cork i see
[01:51:52] <Cork> its a BIG difference
[01:53:44] <Xotix> So that's why the wrapping is needed. So I'm not assigning the return value but the function statement.
[01:55:21] <Cork> no
[01:55:29] <Whirl3d> can you get a value returned from triggering a function bound to an element. var test=$(element).trigger("someFunc");
[01:55:32] <Cork> its needed to make sure $ is jQuery
[01:57:14] <Cork> ?eval var jQuery = {}; var $ = jQuery; $.tmp = 1; jQuery.tmp
[01:57:15] <bot-t> Cork: 1
[01:57:31] <Cork> ?eval var jQuery = {}; var $ = {}; $.tmp = 1; jQuery.tmp
[01:57:32] <bot-t> Cork: undefined
[01:57:44] <demetan> ?global
[01:57:46] <bot-t> demetan, Global Ajax Event Handlers - These methods register handlers to be called when certain events, such as initialization or completion, take place for any AJAX request on the page. http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[01:57:56] <Xotix> Cork ok thanks
[01:57:57] <Cork> ?eval var jQuery = {}; var $ = {}; (function($){ $.tmp = 1; })(jQuery)  jQuery.tmp
[01:57:58] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[01:58:03] <Cork> ?eval var jQuery = {}; var $ = {}; (function($){ $.tmp = 1; })(jQuery);  jQuery.tmp
[01:58:04] <bot-t> Cork: 1
[01:58:09] <Cork> thats the point
[01:59:36] <Xotix> Cork, I'm sure i got it now. thanks
[02:02:48] <DannyZB> anyone here knows a thing or two about plugin authoring ?
[02:02:55] <DannyZB> I can't seem to get the methods/options thing right
[02:03:04] <demetan> how can I set ip global variables : jquery outputs 2 variables, whom are undefined out. if I set up this variables above jquery
[02:03:47] <demetan> they are not synchoron
[02:03:57] * Whirl3d wipes his brow and wishes Cork good luck
[02:04:43] <Cork> demetan: ip?
[02:05:03] <Whirl3d> DannyZB, do you have a fiddle to look at?
[02:05:08] <demetan> set up sorry
[02:05:15] <XeruX> How can I compare two strings, like %mystring% with thisismystring2 (which should be true)
[02:05:29] <Cork> demetan: where do you need to create the global variable?
[02:05:30] <DannyZB> whirl3d: I can't set up a fiddle because I don't even know what I'm doing
[02:05:39] <DannyZB> I want a plugin with methods and options
[02:05:54] <DannyZB> and all the examples do it differently .. I don't get how to do it right
[02:05:56] <Cork> XeroXer: ===
[02:06:18] <Whirl3d> That's the best time to setup a fiddle. When you need help. Show us the part where "you can't seem to get methods/options thing right"
[02:06:19] <Cork> *XeruX
[02:07:13] <Whirl3d> DannyZB, I have the same issue. I wish there was a guide for when to use which format for a plugin. For someone who has done it, it's second nature. For the rest of us, it is really not easy to figure out.
[02:07:15] <DannyZB> k I'll improvise something
[02:07:41] <DannyZB> thats the problem with the plugins .. there are a million ways to do it and nobody just uses one
[02:08:00] <chris_abyi> Hey there. I'm not yet very familiar with jQuery and I've got a question ;) I have several div's that I bind an onClick event to, using their class as selector. Unfortunatelty, I need to fetch one parameter (id) which is individual for each div. Currently, I only bind the onClick event once in the masterPage, and independently of the div I actually hit, the "id" parameter is always the same.
[02:08:23] <chris_abyi> How can I resolve this issue? Do I need to bind the onClick event to each div individually? Thanks for your help!
[02:08:52] <DannyZB> chris , first of all , welcome
[02:08:59] <chris_abyi> DannyZB: cheers :)
[02:09:03] <DannyZB> second of all .. shorten your questions I got dizzy looking at it
[02:09:09] <DannyZB> and third of all , you can filter by id
[02:09:22] <DannyZB> $("#id").onclick(function() { something });
[02:10:12] <Whirl3d> chris_abyi, if you are binding .on to the master page element, you can get the id of the clicked div by loooking at the $(e.target).attr("id") value. $("masterdiv").on("click",function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); var id=targ.attr('id");});
[02:10:53] <Cork> or you can just use the delegat feature
[02:11:16] <Cork> $('masterdiv').on('click', 'div', function() { this.id });
[02:11:22] <DannyZB> he's saying he wants a different filter for each id ?
[02:11:23] <Whirl3d> I was just typing that.
[02:11:39] <Cork> so?
[02:12:22] <DEADB33F> Is there a jquery method I can use to toggle a class then toggle it back a second later?
[02:13:27] <DannyZB> DEADB33F: use $(something).removeClass("class").delay(1000).addClass("class");
[02:14:23] <chris_abyi> DannyZB, Whirl3d: thanks for the quick reply. Probably you got me wrong or I didn't get your point. Here's what I got so far: http://pastebin.com/xMzTPVxX
[02:14:46] <demetan> Cork: please see http://jsfiddle.net/BTN3w/
[02:15:03] <DannyZB> chris : var id =  $('.galleryItemMetadata')
[02:15:10] <DannyZB> why aren't you using the "this" keyword ?
[02:15:15] <chris_abyi> There are several items in the class "galleryItemMetadata", each with an individual id. When executing the function, I need the individual id.
[02:15:47] <DannyZB> var id =  $(this).parent().attr("id").substring(9);
[02:15:49] <DannyZB> try that
[02:16:18] <chris_abyi> DannyZB: what's the difference?
[02:16:27] <chris_abyi> ah
[02:16:30] <chris_abyi> okay, got it
[02:16:54] <DannyZB> yea.. it wasn't a unique selector
[02:17:32] <chris_abyi> yep, pretty cool. cheers guys!
[02:19:35] <nVee> Hey guys, i think im not understanding the concept correctly here. I want to predefine properties for a jquery function, then add the properties, as well as add additional properties, but I get a syntax error. Can someone help me please :) http://jsfiddle.net/yPNHE/
[02:19:58] <PavelloZ> click "JSLint" on top
[02:20:01] <PavelloZ> and read carefully :)
[02:20:20] <PavelloZ> i would start of removing "" around document, though
[02:23:45] <DannyZB> nVee : you're unfamiliar with the .extend function ?
[02:24:00] <nVee> hey DannyZB, yes I am
[02:24:21] <nVee> let me read up on that
[02:24:50] <nVee> ahhh i see :)
[02:24:59] <DannyZB> it's basically $.extend({ property : 'value' , property : 'value ... } , original-array );
[02:25:04] <StevenCodes> anyone tell me if http://www.stevencodes.com/    looks good ?
[02:25:39] <DannyZB> StevenCodes : looks cool , I'd lighten the background color a bit though
[02:25:42] <nVee> so I cannot merge properties by just adding them to the same function, thank you for your help :)
[02:26:04] <DannyZB> A lighter grey on the sides I mean *
[02:26:19] <StevenCodes> DannyZB, yeah I got that, thanks for input anything else :)
[02:26:24] <nVee> yeah it looks good stafamus, maybe just a bit more spacing (line height) and not to fond of the header font?
[02:26:33] <nVee> StevenCodes
[02:26:33] <nVee> lol
[02:26:34] <Whirl3d> StevenCodes, too busy for my taste. You don't have enough difference in the size of your elements, it looks like everything has the same importance.
[02:26:49] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  example ?
[02:27:00] <StevenCodes> nVee,  lol ?
[02:27:09] <DannyZB> yea he's got a point .. modern design is more spacy
[02:27:12] <Whirl3d> StevenCodes. When I look at your page, my eye jumps around trying to find the important shit.
[02:27:13] <nVee> StevenCodes: Dont ask for opinions if you cannot take it
[02:27:24] <DannyZB> The time for the war against empty spaces has long gone
[02:27:29] <StevenCodes> I am taking it im litteraly writing notes
[02:27:31] <StevenCodes> lol
[02:27:51] <DannyZB> Steven do you know a lil' bit of color theory ?
[02:28:09] <StevenCodes> DannyZB,  nah
[02:28:18] <StevenCodes> color contrasting and comparing isn't my thing
[02:28:22] <Whirl3d> StevenCodes. You should make each of your topics distinct by showing them grouped together with their titles. Right now, it's not clear if your titles are just alternate lines in a table format.
[02:28:47] <DannyZB> In short : Red gets you excited , Yellow is serene , Blue is confident/safe , green is rich and brown is sorta neutral
[02:29:09] <DannyZB> oh and black is stylish / white is pure/clean
[02:29:18] <StevenCodes> hmm thats pretty cool
[02:29:21] <nVee> your designer is using the same template tho?
[02:29:36] <nVee> but their headers is a bit better spaced
[02:29:39] <nVee> http://webmotive.pl/strony-internetowe
[02:29:50] <hurry> I can only load one side of the page with ajax? calling because I want to load the page, I also upload all the HTML structure, thus having a double layout
[02:29:55] <DannyZB> You need to pull the eyes towards the right content .. what do you want your users to focus on ?
[02:30:07] <Whirl3d> Plus, I can't stand times roman bold, blech.
[02:30:16] <StevenCodes> DannyZB, articles but how can I make it stick out ?
[02:30:20] <nVee> use the same header font as the designers users, it looks cooler :)
[02:30:30] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  I've been to fuckin hell and back trying to smooth the fonts
[02:30:38] <DannyZB> First of all use a different font
[02:30:41] <Whirl3d> fontsquirrel ftw
[02:30:44] <nVee> you cannot smooth times :P
[02:30:47] <DannyZB> second of all create more contrast in the headings
[02:30:50] <nVee> there is no smooth in times roman
[02:31:03] <DannyZB> I think Lumosity.com is an example of useful design
[02:31:04] <StevenCodes> alright
[02:31:10] <StevenCodes> checkign
[02:31:10] <nVee> times roman is like the weird kid at the party
[02:31:40] <Whirl3d> the ubiquitous weird kid at that
[02:31:50] <Pupeno_W> Damn… at some point I had a sortable connected to a nested sortable working beautifully and then I broke it… not sure how :(
[02:31:55] <DannyZB> times roman is the adopted kid nobody likes
[02:32:10] <nVee> but that adopted kid don't know he's adopted
[02:32:13] <nVee> but everyone else does
[02:32:21] <Whirl3d> whereas Georgia Italic is a whore
[02:32:25] <DannyZB> yea .. you can't avoid him but you don't want him there
[02:32:25] <Whirl3d> that everyone loves
[02:32:35] <DannyZB> and Comic sans is a Jihadist islamist
[02:32:46] <gob> lol
[02:33:03] * Whirl3d slaps forhead in disbelief
[02:33:17] <DannyZB> basically you would want a good balance of Prostitute / Lawyer in your designs
[02:33:22] <DannyZB> thats what we're trying to tell you
[02:33:39] <StevenCodes> lol i know i'm workin on it
[02:33:50] <peiper> hi there
[02:33:51] <Whirl3d> But listen. It's not terrible.
[02:33:57] <Whirl3d> So don't get us wrong
[02:34:17] <Whirl3d> We were giving "critical" reviews to help, not to discourage
[02:34:20] <DannyZB> yea I kinda like it
[02:34:26] <peiper> some1 with good jquery ui knowledge here?
[02:34:40] <DannyZB> It's just that .. if I bumped into a website like that I would exit immediately , it's hard to focus on it
[02:34:41] <Whirl3d> ?ask@peiper
[02:34:42] <bot-t> peiper, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:34:55] <StevenCodes> lol Whirl3d  trust me i'm not taking anything you say as a "bad" thing get you guys are trying to help, i'm american LMAO
[02:35:08] <DannyZB> Steven I think I got the problem
[02:35:15] <DannyZB> use a different + bigger font for the articles
[02:35:25] <DannyZB> add some spacing around it + spacing between articles
[02:35:28] <DannyZB> and make the headings stand out
[02:35:36] <StevenCodes> hmm good idea
[02:35:42] <peiper> connected UL's with .draggable(); -> have a problem when an UL gets empty and you want to put one in there
[02:35:46] <DannyZB> (maybe different color headings for articles on different topics ? )
[02:36:08] <Whirl3d> Oh, it looks like you arent' loading Droid Seriff correctly.
[02:36:48] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  only for sidebar and h2 a
[02:37:01] <dannN> Hi! Is there a way to get the key pressed as a lowercase string on jquery event keydown()? i.e. pressing escape on keyboard: 'esc'
[02:37:51] <Whirl3d> but it looks like timesRoman bold...which is indicative of a missing font load when it's supposed to be Droid Seriff
[02:38:05] <DannyZB> dannN: e.keyCode == 27
[02:38:15] <DannyZB> you can use keycodes directly
[02:38:29] <dannN> But is there a way to get the key name ?
[02:38:35] <StevenCodes> what about 	Trebuchet MS ?
[02:38:35] <peiper> not really
[02:38:36] <DannyZB> peiper : put a ghost li in there maybe ? dunno
[02:38:44] <Whirl3d> I used to have a nice keyCode->string library setup, but you are gonna have to do it yourself.
[02:38:58] <StevenCodes> little better http://www.stevencodes.com/
[02:39:09] <peiper> DannyZB, atleast a good idea ill give it a try!
[02:39:15] <Whirl3d> StevenCodes, check out FontSquirrel or Google Web Fonts.
[02:39:36] <StevenCodes> checking
[02:39:42] <DannyZB> A little bit more spacing but now it looks wierd on the left
[02:39:52] <DannyZB> it's spacey on the right and sits right on the border on the left
[02:40:19] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d, How do I use the otf?
[02:40:44] <DannyZB> And about the headings .. why don't you use an additional gradient behind the menu ?
[02:41:14] <Whirl3d> Google has a great tutorial (short) on what you need to add to your header. Same with FontSquirrel. It's really easy.
[02:41:54] <StevenCodes> alrighty checking and DannyZB  thought if i went the same on other side it would look stupid
[02:42:30] <DannyZB> Steven : about the menu
[02:42:42] <DannyZB> I played around with it a bit and lucida grande / white looks good as a font for it
[02:43:29] <Whirl3d> anybody know of an easy way to find the most specific common ancestor of a collection of elements.?
[02:43:43] <StevenCodes> DannyZB, checking
[02:45:31] <raj> I'm doing $('.info, .edit').bind('clickoutside', function(e){...}), but it breaks clickoutside
[02:45:44] <raj> as in, clicking within .info OR .edit doesn't work
[02:45:59] <raj> if I just have 1 selector, it works fie
[02:46:01] <raj> fine
[02:47:00] <peiper> raj try $('.info', '.edit')
[02:47:35] <StevenCodes> DannyZB, good now?
[02:48:04] <nFFF> peiper that would be context
[02:48:31] <raj> nope
[02:48:36] <raj> didn't work peiper
[02:48:53] <dannN> Is there a function to fire an event? var foo = function() { this.close(); }; -> fireEvent(foo) or something like that?
[02:49:21] <DannyZB> a lil' bit better
[02:49:25] <DannyZB> one sec I'll show you smth
[02:49:27] <nFFF> raj there is nothing wrong with your multiple selectors
[02:49:40] <nFFF> so perhaps they are wrong
[02:49:53] <peiper> raj can u put your code on JS fiddle? looks like the code inside is the problem
[02:49:54] <DannyZB> and I said Lucidia Grande
[02:49:55] <raj> the plugin you mean?
[02:49:59] <DannyZB> lucidia serif is something else
[02:50:14] <nFFF> raj, your syntaxis correct, so Im guessing your selectors are invalid
[02:50:15] <peiper> DannyZB, use .trigger();
[02:50:23] <raj> selectors are valid
[02:50:28] <StevenCodes> DannyZB,  kk doing didnt see the grande
[02:50:37] <nFFF> put your code on jsfiddle
[02:50:39] <nFFF> with markup
[02:50:40] <raj> nFFF, it works when I do them individually
[02:50:49] <raj> but when I put them together, it doesn't work
[02:51:11] <raj> nFFF, I'm using http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/jquery-clickoutside-event-v10/
[02:51:32] <DannyZB> StevenCodes : do you use google chrome ?
[02:51:34] <peiper> raj http://jsfiddle.net/
[02:51:41] <StevenCodes> DannyZB, ff
[02:51:49] <nFFF> cool
[02:51:51] <DannyZB> Firebug installed ?
[02:52:08] <StevenCodes> yup
[02:52:15] <nFFF> I have no idea about that plugin
[02:52:19] <DannyZB> You're playing around with it or the original code ?
[02:52:23] <nFFF> perhaps it doesn't support multiple elements
[02:52:23] <dannN> i've a code http://pastebin.com/01SYvrbH and there i want to fire the event. how can i do this?
[02:52:31] <majd> Hey #jquery - when i do $("input:radio[name=x]").each( $(this).bind("click", function() { //do something }), , is the click event fired right away?
[02:52:37] <StevenCodes> DannyZB,  im using it but the fonts dont change much
[02:52:43] <Ring0`> Hey. http://jsfiddle.net/yqHCQ/2/ I'm generating those 4 file upload forms dynamically, I'd like to submit form after selecting file but for some reason it submits some (other?) form which ain't upload.php.
[02:53:47] <peiper> majd, $("input:radio[name=x]").on("click", function() { /*code*/ }); would be better
[02:54:44] <DannyZB> StevenCodes : http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/268/screenshot20120412at125.png/
[02:54:56] <peiper> majd, you need to put it inside a $(function) or document ready
[02:55:00] <DannyZB> Not the prettiest thing in the world , but try to focus on the articles you'd see it's easier
[02:55:16] <raj> peiper, nFFF http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/CzAJA/
[02:57:33] <StevenCodes> DannyZB,  I just tried this http://www.stevencodes.com/
[02:57:46] <nFFF> Yea works for me
[02:58:01] <nFFF> raj, whats the issue?
[02:58:03] <DannyZB> oh thats better
[02:58:10] <DannyZB> now get a different font this one doesn't stand out
[02:58:28] <raj> i don't want there to be an alert if either of those two elements are clicked
[02:58:29] <peiper> nFFF, click inside the textbox
[02:58:31] <peiper> it wont work
[02:58:41] <DannyZB> and why Lucidia Serif for the menu ?
[02:58:54] <StevenCodes> dannN,  its grande now
[02:59:03] <StevenCodes> damn its not
[02:59:22] <nFFF> raj, right now it works as it should
[02:59:35] <raj> so you don't get an alert when clicking inside the textbox?
[03:00:12] <nFFF> no I do, but thats becuase its not inside the first divelement
[03:00:22] <StevenCodes> DannyZB,  there luncinda grande
[03:00:25] <nFFF> If you click on one of those elements you get 1 alert
[03:00:28] <DannyZB> non-bold
[03:00:32] <raj> right
[03:00:34] <majd> peiper: this is the behaviour i want: when the user clicks on a radio button, another list of radio buttons is displayed (content retreived via ajax from the server),
[03:00:34] <nFFF> and outside either, you get 2
[03:00:35] <raj> i don't want any alerts
[03:00:36] <DannyZB> Lucidia grande is better in it's regular form
[03:00:44] <nFFF> ok
[03:00:48] <raj> for a click INSIDE 'either' of those two elements
[03:01:03] <timing> Guys, how do I tell Opera Mini (and thus Opera's server) to not fuck up my website?
[03:01:03] <StevenCodes> DannyZB, was spelling wrong anyways lol
[03:01:18] <StevenCodes> nah didnt matter
[03:01:20] <dannN> Does anybody know how i can fire an event here: http://pastebin.com/pgQCEVNb
[03:01:49] <DannyZB> StevenCodes : Trebuchet MS looks good for the titles
[03:02:01] <StevenCodes> kk sweetness
[03:02:16] <DannyZB> and the menu .. use non-bold font already lol I hate bolded websites
[03:02:22] <xec_> dannN: keys[e.which]() ?
[03:02:26] <raj> nFFF, how do I make that happen?
[03:02:51] <StevenCodes> DannyZB,  yeah just took that off
[03:02:52] <StevenCodes> lol
[03:02:55] <StevenCodes> was like wtf
[03:03:06] <DannyZB> Yea major improvement
[03:03:12] <DannyZB> now the website doesn't hurt my eyes
[03:03:17] <StevenCodes> lol
[03:03:20] <StevenCodes> anything else?
[03:03:26] <DannyZB> Try Trebuchet MS for the article tytles
[03:03:28] <DannyZB> titles *
[03:03:41] <DannyZB> it's not super pretty but it's sorta ok for everything .. easy on the eyes
[03:03:42] <majd> peiper: both on() and bind() seem to fire the event when they binding is called - i don't understand why
[03:03:49] <Bazo0oka> Hello i attached "onChange" event to select field, but when i change the value of this select field by using jQuery("#select-field").val('value') ; the event is not executed !!! any help ?
[03:04:15] <StevenCodes> DannyZB,  doing
[03:04:24] <dannN> xec_: is a way but i want to execute the function assign to the var, so i can use the this keyword this.close()
[03:04:56] <DannyZB> And one last thing , add padding to the article texts
[03:05:00] <DannyZB> top - right padding
[03:05:08] <StevenCodes> kk
[03:05:30] <SGhosh> Hey all!
[03:05:42] <xec_> dannN: "this" inside that function doesn't make sense to me tbh - what is it supposed to do?
[03:05:57] <xec_> or be
[03:06:03] <SGhosh> var divList = $("div"); what does this return?
[03:06:08] <DannyZB> I think 10px 10px 10px 10px padding looks good
[03:06:26] <nFFF> raj, the easiest way is to wrap them in a containing element
[03:06:32] <nFFF> and bind one event to the containing element
[03:06:38] <raj> nFFF, one is a popup dialog
[03:06:46] <xec_> DannyZB, StevenCodes: design is off topic, maybe try #design or take it to PM?
[03:06:54] <Sebah> Hey! I have the following script http://jsfiddle.net/r6vh8/7/. It's working fine apart from updating the input's value in the HTML, even though if I try $('input').val() it returns the right one. What do you think the problem might be?
[03:06:56] <StevenCodes> DannyZB, mind a pm?
[03:07:01] <DannyZB> nope
[03:07:10] <raj> nFFF, even if I add a class to both of them, it doesn't work
[03:07:35] <raj> ...if I bind then to the newly assigned class, that is...it still alerts
[03:07:55] <raj> it's like it binds to .each of them
[03:08:14] <raj> even with e.stopPropagation()
[03:08:57] <Putr> hi! I'm using .each() in a class .. how do i access the classes *this* from within the each() ?
[03:09:31] <SGhosh> Please somebody help!!
[03:09:32] <SGhosh> var divList = $("div"); what does this return?
[03:09:48] <xec_> Putr: um. what? show us your code?
[03:10:04] <xec_> SGhosh: a jquery collection containing all divs
[03:10:51] <SGhosh> xec_ : so can i do this?  var divList = $(".a #g td");
[03:10:58] <Martz_> Can anyone help me? Iam making a mobile website, and whenever the orientation of the device changes i want to execute a function, but i cant find out if jquery or JS can notice a orientation change, anyone knows how to do this? (the jquery mobile orientation function doenst work)
[03:11:45] <xec_> SGhosh: maybe, if you wanted to select all td's inside something with id "g" inside something with class "a"
[03:12:03] <xec_> SGhosh: doesn't make much sense to still call the variable "divList" though
[03:12:17] <Putr> xec_: http://pastebin.com/XiZS2CAT
[03:12:43] <Putr> lol typo in the pastebin (not Show but How)
[03:12:59] <Putr> How do i set/get the this.somethign
[03:13:04] <xec_> Putr: you can cache this, like var self = this; and then use self inside the each
[03:13:33] <Putr> so basicly i have to set a global variable?
[03:13:38] <xec_> not global
[03:13:44] <majd> here the full code that's causing the problem: the code inside the function() is being excuted right away, and not on click... http://dpaste.com/730566/
[03:13:50] <Putr> aha i see... var self
[03:13:52] <xec_> var self = this; inside the foo() function
[03:13:58] <xec_> right
[03:14:05] <Putr> so aha ok ok, that makes sense
[03:14:13] <Putr> thanks!
[03:14:15] <xec_> np :)
[03:15:12] <raj> nFFF, unfortunate that there's no way to do this
[03:15:42] <SGhosh> xec_ : actually i need to get a list of all span elements inside ts which id inside a div with some id and then access the spans through an index. Is the idea possible?
[03:15:46] <raj> i solved it in another way by stopping propagation on the element's click
[03:15:59] <raj> not ideal, but it'll do for now
[03:16:12] <xec_> SGhosh: what? ts? could you pastebin a snippet of your html?
[03:16:49] <madcow> http://jsfiddle.net/WChds/2/
[03:17:07] <madcow> im trying to get the marked boxes to clear (not a working demo, just my code)
[03:17:28] <madcow> nevermind
[03:17:29] <Whirl3d> Martz, have you looked at jquery mobile. They might be able to help
[03:17:37] <madcow> << idiot ;)
[03:17:57] <SGhosh> xec_ : actually i need to get a list of all span elements inside td which id inside a div with some id and then access the spans through an index. (sorry!)
[03:18:17] <Putr> xec_: hey.. the example.. var self = this ... does this copy the variable.. or only the refrence?
[03:18:47] <xec_> theres no cloning going on, its just a reference, yes
[03:18:53] <raj> is there a better alternative to http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/Editable ?
[03:18:55] <Whirl3d> SGhosh, since only one element can have an id, you don't need any selectors before the id. Just after the id.
[03:18:55] <Putr> xec_: awsome :)
[03:19:01] <raj> perhaps with jquery-ui
[03:19:24] <dannN> Is in jQuery a similar method to MooTools's .call() ?
[03:19:38] <Martz_> Whirl3d: yea i did, but there are hardly any examples, and the 1 function i found that did work just kept spamming when ever the orientation changed (and i just want to execute 1 function, not keep executing it till the browser crashes)
[03:19:50] <Whirl3d> $("div a p#something") should give you the same results as $("#something") unless you are testing to see if #something is in the right place...then it's a very special circumstance...
[03:20:10] <xec_> SGhosh: $("#someId td span") will select all spans inside table cells inside #someID, just like a css selector
[03:20:19] <Whirl3d> Martz, try that function again, but return false in the callback.
[03:20:32] <Whirl3d> or e.stopPropogation() or e.preventDefault();
[03:20:44] <Whirl3d> Should stop the "spamming", I would guess
[03:22:54] <Zekia> hi, I have a form with some inputs and some textareas, actually I'm using $( "#"+idForm+" input" ).each(function(){. As expected, it only selects inputs. How should I do to select inputs and textareas in the order they appear in the dom. Thx :)
[03:24:28] <Whirl3d> Zekia, have you tried $("#"+idForm).children().filter(".textArea, input");
[03:24:51] <Whirl3d> *textarea (no dot)
[03:25:14] <Zekia> nop, ill try it, thx for help :)
[03:26:37] <xec_> Whirl3d, Zekia; you can throw the selector right in the .children("textarea, input")
[03:26:50] <majd> I still don't understand why when i bind an object to click using on('click', function() { // do something }, the content of function() is triggered right away, without waiting for the click...
[03:27:02] <majd> this is the code i'm using : http://dpaste.com/730566/
[03:27:09] <Whirl3d> xec_ I wasn't sure if it would find all textareas _then_ all inputs in that case
[03:28:23] <Whirl3d> majd, setup a fiddle that explains the problem.
[03:28:24] <xec_> i would expect .filter() to do the exact same
[03:28:28] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d, www.stevencodes.com :)
[03:28:34] <xec_> order, that is
[03:29:33] <majd> Whirl3d: i would, but i'm doing a bunch of ajax calls to my local dev machine to get the content...
[03:29:34] <Whirl3d> StevenCodes, you are getting there. It looks a lot better, but consider this: your tags and the little utility items under the title are the same size as your text. Are they equally as important?
[03:29:40] <NodeX> Many ask whether or not to use class or id when using css selectors. This all depends on what the use of the HTML tag is, are you going to be using the style on multiple elements? or are you going to use it on one element? Well lets go over a situation in which
[03:29:51] <NodeX> always use ID where you can it's about a zillion times faster
[03:30:13] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  good point
[03:30:20] <Whirl3d> StevenCodes, I would keep the tags/utlitiy text tiny and grey like you have it. But bump up your body text and headilines.
[03:30:40] <StevenCodes> i was going oppisite way but ill try it
[03:31:03] <Whirl3d> And if you change the headline background to be closer in nature to the background of your article elements, it will give it more uniformity and will help with the illusion that tyour articles are supposedly floating on the page.
[03:31:23] <Whirl3d> which is why you have the drop shadow background element under each article, presumably
[03:31:35] <Zekia> seems like i have an error somewhere
[03:31:38] <Zekia>         $("#"+this.idForm).children().filter("textarea, input").each(function(){
[03:31:38] <Zekia>             console.log(this);
[03:31:38] <Zekia>         }
[03:31:48] <Zekia> returns nothing :s
[03:31:54] <Whirl3d> what is "this"
[03:31:56] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  boom done
[03:32:03] <StevenCodes> way better
[03:32:12] <Zekia> this is a javascript object :)
[03:32:30] <Zekia> oh
[03:32:31] <Zekia> im
[03:32:33] <Zekia> fucking stupid
[03:32:34] <Zekia> ><
[03:32:43] <Altreus> .class:first selects the element I expect in IE. .class:not(:first) also selects it, as well as all the other .classes. Only run this test IE8 so far but IE7 seems to exhibit the same behaviour
[03:32:49] <Whirl3d> StevenCodes, you are definitely getting there. It looks much better.
[03:32:57] <Altreus> am I using :not wrong?
[03:33:08] <StevenCodes> good stuff
[03:33:20] <StevenCodes> thanks for your help Whirl3d  much appreciated
[03:33:23] <Zekia> well i logged ($(this))
[03:33:28] <Zekia> but still getting nothing
[03:33:31] <Zekia> so weirdo
[03:33:34] <Whirl3d> StevenCodes, when writing, you don't want to split a verb in the middle like to really get something...
[03:34:02] <Hippie> I have a .fadeTo then a .text on the next line.. The text changes instantly and i only want it to change after the fade has been completed
[03:34:28] <Whirl3d> so, I tend to use the same logic for my title elements and their body text. If you want to visually separate them, put the utlitiy items to the right , but they shouldn't get in the way of the flow between your headline and body copy.
[03:34:50] <StevenCodes> hmm hotcha
[03:34:52] <StevenCodes> gotcha*
[03:34:54] <Whirl3d> In fact, they should be with the tags.
[03:35:20] <Whirl3d> since they are all the same "kind" of extra information. Perhaps even hide the shit until someone clicks on it or mouses over it.
[03:36:17] <DannyZB> whirl3d : with those tags floating to the right the page looks MAJORLY better
[03:36:17] <Whirl3d> I could see a single icon in the title of your articles that toggled a verticla panel with all that extra information in it. Then it's there if they want it, but it's not getting in the way of the meat and potatoies: your writing.
[03:37:02] <PavelloZ> Hippie: try calling .text as an fadeTo() callback
[03:37:17] <DannyZB> MAAN writing plug-ins is annoying
[03:37:23] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  great idea +1
[03:37:34] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  push the >> under the article
[03:37:37] <DannyZB> I'm writing a jsfiddle $("JESUS").walkonwater plugin (:
[03:37:49] <Whirl3d> DannyZB, what are you really trying to do?
[03:38:09] <Altreus> >>> $('.step:first')[0] == $('.step:not(:first)')[0]  true
[03:38:09] <Zekia> hmmm its not working, $("#"+this.idForm).children().filter("input").each(function(){ doing nothing, and $( "#"+this.idForm+" input" ).each(function(){ is working :/
[03:38:11] <DannyZB> learn how to write a f*cking plug-in
[03:38:20] <DannyZB> I'll write a super-basic one showing how
[03:39:57] <Whirl3d> StevenCodes, I have a 46" monitor and when I click the >>, the contents of the page slides off the screen rapidly and snaps back. It's off-putting. Perhaps only expand the height of the full article to the height it needs to be...not the entire page.
[03:40:37] <Whirl3d> And then get rid of the drop shadow under the preview text, keep the tags and such at the bottom (or to the right if you did that). They are not as important as what you have to say.
[03:41:09] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  it defetely shouldnt do that :p its a plugin workin on it
[03:41:58] <Whirl3d> Still, it's looking a lot better already.
[03:42:10] <DannyZB> steven : those buttons above each article , the calendar etc ' try floating them to the right
[03:42:44] <StevenCodes> DannyZB, trying
[03:42:50] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  Thanks! :)
[03:42:54] <Nece228> hello
[03:42:55] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/4n8Yq/
[03:43:03] <Nece228> why when i click on an image it doesnt work
[03:43:09] <Whirl3d> np
[03:43:13] <Nece228> it basically should change the image on click
[03:44:06] <Whirl3d> nece228, you don't need the header stuff in the html panel. Just the body.
[03:44:14] <StevenCodes> DannyZB,  nah just floats next to text even with full width
[03:44:30] <DannyZB> StevenCodes : use text-align:right
[03:44:32] <Whirl3d> Plus, if you include a full url in your img src, we could see an image
[03:44:37] <StevenCodes> trying
[03:45:00] <Nece228> Whirl3d: ok but that doesnt solve problem
[03:45:15] <StevenCodes> DannyZB,  nah kinda just makes it look emptier
[03:45:27] <Whirl3d> another thing, try not to use words like "button" for your id's.   also you can't append something to an img element
[03:46:03] <Whirl3d> you want to say: $("#buttonItem").click(function ( e) {e.preventDefault(); $(this).attr("src", newurl);});
[03:46:22] <Whirl3d> where newurl is the url to your new image.
[03:46:32] <Nece228> Whirl3d: oh, it seems replaceWith works, but is it correct way to do this?
[03:46:38] <DannyZB> StevenCodes : .tags { display:none }
[03:46:50] <DannyZB> Just my opinion (:
[03:47:01] <Whirl3d> But even better would be to make your image contain both the smileys and then overflow:hidden
[03:47:09] <StevenCodes> hmmm
[03:47:17] <Zekia> ok, i solved the thing, its just that when you use $("#id1 type1") type1 can be the son of the son while children is only selecting direct childs, so i add to children().children(), thx for help ;)
[03:47:19] <Whirl3d> then you can just change the background offset position for your element when you click it.
[03:47:37] <Whirl3d> Zekia, try find
[03:47:46] <NodeX> $("#id1 type1") <-- type1 is not a node name
[03:47:54] <DannyZB> What Whirl3d said .. that way it doesn't need to load images when you hover over an element ( no delay )
[03:49:42] <Zekia> worked with find, and much more elegant, ty again :p
[03:50:30] <StevenCodes> alright guys i'm out bye everyone!
[03:53:21] <youngin> http://thechive.com/2012/04/11/if-you-see-a-large-red-mysterious-button-always-push-it-video/
[03:53:59] <majd> Here: why is the alert() being displayed twice? http://jsfiddle.net/2UV5g/
[03:54:09] <Nece228> Whirl3d: well your code doesnt seem to work for some reason, and whats that overflow method?
[03:54:20] <majd> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/2UV5g/ - why is the alert showing twice?
[03:55:49] <majd> seems like the function is bound twice...
[03:56:08] <Zogot> majd: http://jsfiddle.net/zpfGf/3/
[03:58:07] <spyzer> hey everyone, if a div has two classes and each of that class has been bound to a click handler through live, is there a way to execute only one of the handlers?? Please tell
[04:01:25] <majd> Zogot: hmmmm - seems to work on the jsfiddle -thanks, but can you explain what was going on?
[04:01:29] <Whirl3d> majd, enclose the value in your attrubte selector in quotes
[04:01:37] <Whirl3d> name='dst']
[04:03:11] <nVee> I am using datepicker and have a specified format (mysql date) but want to also convert that date into a timestamp, I understand I can do var newDate = new Date(oldDate) but how do I convert that into a timestamp?
[04:03:24] <nVee> I effectively want to compare 2 date
[04:04:37] <Nece228> ok so this i am figuring out
[04:04:39] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/4n8Yq/1/
[04:05:08] <Nece228> basically when i press the #button it should change the image, but it should be at the same location as it was
[04:06:03] <Nece228> because now it changes the image but it goes back to first position
[04:11:42] <Zogot> majd: When you bind an event, it binds it to all occurances in the dom that matches the "fn" you filled in
[04:11:53] <Zogot> majd: say $('.classname') understand?
[04:15:42] <NodeX> "fn" is a little misleading as in most languages it means function
[04:15:57] <majd> Zogot: so in my code, the first time the function was bound was for .children(), the second was .each() ?
[04:16:49] <Zogot> NodeX: Aye thats what I had known/though it was, but it is the way jquery calls the selectors right? I'm almost certain I saw fn.function or so

[04:17:57] <Slydder> hey all. I am needing to save the state of containers that I can open, close and swap around. I thought I'd take a look at UI Layout and am just completely lost as it seems to require a central container where other contains on the same layer are around it. this is not what I was needing because I have a central container where the containers that move and collapse are in it. is there another option to UI Layout that would work?
[04:18:05] <NodeX> $(selector).plugin({},fn);
[04:20:33] <Cork> Slydder: your talking about a plugin?
[04:21:24] <Cork> as far as i know jquery-ui doens't have a layout component yet
[04:22:03] <Kingsy> guys, how do you break out of an each() function loop ?
[04:22:13] <Cork> return false;
[04:22:17] <Kingsy> thanks
[04:24:20] <nVee> anyone ever had an issue where you use $.extend() and it says that the object is undefined?
[04:24:43] <Cork> what your extending needs to be an object
[04:24:59] <Cork> ?eval var a = 1; $.extend(a, {});
[04:25:00] <caniuse> Cork: 'ReferenceError: $ is not defined'
[04:25:05] <Cork> uh...
[04:25:09] <Cork> ah
[04:25:13] <Cork> caniuse...
[04:27:02] <raj> Instead of submitting each field that's edited, how can I have 1 submit button at the end for all my fields with jeditable? http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[04:27:12] <nVee> Cork: here is my code haha
[04:27:12] <nVee> http://jsfiddle.net/MHfDW/
[04:27:50] <Kingsy> another quick one, if I have an element as "this" in the each loop.. how do you reference a child element of that object ?
[04:28:04] <Cork> nVee: whats from?
[04:28:27] <Cork> Kingsy: $(this).find()
[04:28:39] <Kingsy> ah ok
[04:28:40] <Cork> or if you want direct children()
[04:29:02] <nVee> Cork: sorry, to be exact, this is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/MHfDW/2/
[04:31:20] <Nece228> (this).replaceWith('<img id="button" src="img/smileybad.png"/>')
[04:31:33] <Nece228> i want to add specific css code into that
[04:31:42] <Nece228> like it should also replace css
[04:31:51] <Cork> nVee: properties vs properies

[04:35:11] <f3rr31r4> hello can some one help me please - http://pastebin.com/h4tb6Zck
[04:35:58] <DannyZB> whats "data : data.json" supposed to do ?
[04:36:29] <f3rr31r4> data = the data in data.json
[04:36:48] <DannyZB> you want a json array ?
[04:37:17] <f3rr31r4> yes
[04:37:19] <f3rr31r4> data: [{"id":3,"name":"ola","series":[{"name":"proj 1","start":"Apr 1, 2012 12:00:00 AM","end":"Apr 22, 2012 12:00:00 AM"}]},{"id":6,"name":"xx","series":[{"name":"cc","start":"Apr 18, 2012 12:00:00 AM","end":"Apr 11, 2012 12:00:00 AM"}]}], 				
[04:37:34] <f3rr31r4> should be like this
[04:37:53] <DannyZB> soooo .. whats the problem?
[04:38:02] <DannyZB> a JSON array is just an associative array
[04:38:22] <f3rr31r4> the variable data doesn't exist
[04:38:45] <DannyZB> huh? jQuery.getJSON is the function to use to load JSON data
[04:39:27] <raj> has anyone used jeditable?
[04:39:41] <f3rr31r4> like this ?????   data: $.getJSON("data.json", function() {})
[04:39:46] <raj> I'm wondering how to use it with a single submit button for all fields
[04:40:02] <raj> instead of posting with the editing of each single field
[04:40:15] <DannyZB> yea
[04:40:28] <f3rr31r4> doesn't work :(
[04:40:29] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[04:41:42] <raj> caniuse has high blood pressure
[04:42:32] <f3rr31r4> basic it doesn't show any error and when trying to access to the variable in firebug it doesn't appear, and doesn't get the data.json

[04:45:13] <Nece228> why this line doesnt work?
[04:45:43] <DannyZB> it's $("#button").css("top","500px");
[04:46:52] <Nece228> DannyZB: still doesnt work for me, anyway thanks for syntax fix
[04:47:14] <DannyZB> Nece : don't forget Position:absolute or position:relative
[04:47:27] <Nece228> well its working

[04:59:01] <bmc> hello everyone
[04:59:15] <f3rr31r4> how to pass ganttData to data? http://pastebin.com/h4tb6Zck
[05:01:59] <bmc> i think i might have found a bug in .height() yikes!
[05:02:28] <pachet> f3rr31r4: do you understand what $.getJSON returns?
[05:02:34] <pachet> its a jq ajax obj
[05:02:43] <pachet> what's your thinking there
[05:02:59] <bmc> when using this method on a cssstickyfooter, .height() gives me a bigger number than firebug and chrome do
[05:03:50] <f3rr31r4> pachet, i have 6 hours reading and trying json :(
[05:03:59] <f3rr31r4> still learning :(
[05:04:15] <pachet> well, maybe i can save you some time
[05:04:29] <pachet> $.getJSON is just a convenience wrapper around $.ajax
[05:04:30] <f3rr31r4> <pachet> ;) thanks
[05:04:36] <pachet> which returns a jq ajax object
[05:04:42] <f3rr31r4> yes
[05:04:44] <pachet> is that what you're wanting to assign to data?
[05:04:54] <pachet> the reference to the ajax req?
[05:05:01] <pachet> because that's a different think entirely from the responseText
[05:05:14] <pachet> which is what people usually try and suss from a xhr callback
[05:05:34] <f3rr31r4> the object looks like this : data: [{"id":3,"name":"ola","series":[{"name":"proj 1","start":"Apr 1, 2012 12:00:00 AM","end":"Apr 22, 2012 12:00:00 AM"}]},{"id":6,"name":"xx","series":[{"name":"cc","start":"Apr 18, 2012 12:00:00 AM","end":"Apr 11, 2012 12:00:00 AM"}]}], 				
[05:05:58] <pachet> no, that'd be your xhr response
[05:06:08] <pachet> not the ajax req obj
[05:06:19] <f3rr31r4> do i have to use eval???
[05:06:28] <pachet> god, no
[05:06:32] <f3rr31r4> ;)
[05:06:49] <pachet> jquery will pass that object ( if everything goes correctly ) to the second argument that you passed to your $.getJSON
[05:06:53] <pachet> the success callback fn
[05:07:16] <f3rr31r4> ????? fn ????????? what is?
[05:07:50] <pachet> so change that fn to read something like $.getJSON(myUrl, function ( data ) { $(foo).doSomethingWith({internal_data : data}); });
[05:11:26] <vl1234> hi hi
[05:11:40] <bmc> yo
[05:11:50] <soee> hi, guys i have mousenter, mousleave event on one box (toogle class assigned in both events), inside this box i have content that is changed with ajax call, the prblem is when content is loaded and mouse is inside this box class i changed even if i wont leave this box, any idea why?
[05:12:05] <pachet> toogle class :[
[05:12:14] <pachet> $(foo).toogleClass('wtf', true)
[05:12:17] <vl1234> any 1 know how to refresh html div and load a another div content using ajax
[05:12:23] <bmc> pachet: haha
[05:12:35] <DannyZB> I have a function which accepts a variable "method" which I want to pass to a function $(objects).each(function(method) {} );
[05:12:48] <DannyZB> the "method" variable passed to the inner function is empty
[05:13:31] <pachet> DannyZB: why wouldn't it be, you're just binding that identifier, not passing it in
[05:13:43] <DannyZB> I know
[05:13:46] <f3rr31r4> <pachet> like this ? http://pastebin.com/h4tb6Zck
[05:13:49] <DannyZB> the question is how to do it right
[05:13:51] <pachet> $(objects).each(function(){myFunction(method);});
[05:13:53] <bmc> soee: in the fuction where the ajax call happens, you could grab the current class of the element and reassign that class when the ajax has successfully completed
[05:14:04] <asher^> anyone know how i could trigger html5 form validation when using a jquery ui dialog?

[05:15:35] <pachet> qvarkk: you dont HAVE to use each, you could walk the items yourself
[05:15:41] <pachet> but you do have to iterate over them, yes
[05:15:49] <Whirl3d> or map
[05:15:59] <Whirl3d> ?.map
[05:16:09] <Whirl3d> see ?.map
[05:16:24] <qvarkk> pachet: ok, sorry. must i loop through the collection or could i do something like: $('input').val( $( this ).attr('name' ));
[05:16:55] <soee> pachet, looks like setting $(this).toggleClass('shadow', false); in mousleave helped ;o
[05:17:07] <qvarkk> i also need to save the value for later use, is the preferred way to store in a JS-array?

[05:27:22] <poppiez> any way to check if a variable is a jquery object?
[05:27:26] <soee> DannyZB, God cant be delayed :D
[05:27:44] <f3rr31r4> can some one help me, please, thaks http://pastebin.com/h4tb6Zck
[05:27:55] <Cork> dannN: you could init it in dom ready
[05:28:04] <DannyZB> Whirl3d : no it's not .. as It's not the function itself it's inside
[05:28:11] <DannyZB> and in any case it wouldn't break the code
[05:28:35] <Whirl3d> however, inside of .each, you will use $(this), but cache it. So right before the comment, try: var item=$(this); and then return methods.init.apply(item, arguments)
[05:28:39] <Cork> dannN: else you would have to use a callback solution and trigger the callback when you want it initialized
[05:28:46] <Whirl3d> cool enough
[05:29:21] <dannN> Cork: I tried already to set the line 99 into JQ(function() { var Contaolove...... }); but it get an error
[05:29:46] <Cork> dannN: you prob need to make the variable global
[05:30:12] <DannyZB> Whirl3d : the caching thing was noted .. but it still doesn't explain why the delay doesn't work
[05:30:39] <dannN> Cork: I've var Contaolove; outside of the domready function, but it doesn't work
[05:31:17] <daethorian> I am having an issue with jQuery Autocomplete and a custom _renderItem method: https://gist.github.com/2366916

[05:31:27] <daethorian> Any help would be really awesome!
[05:32:08] <dannN> Cork: Is the second class initiated already if it's included into the page header?
[05:32:39] <Cork> dannN: deoens on what you mean by initialized
[05:32:42] <Cork> *depends
[05:33:42] <DannyZB> Jesus is ruining my opensourcing plans ...
[05:33:51] <Cork> dannN: the "class" is parsed and its function is created when the code is read, no way around that
[05:34:00] <dannN> Cork: ok
[05:34:12] <Cork> dannN: if you have some separat init code, that could be run as a separat function

[05:34:19] <raj> I'm loading a jquery-ui dialog, and the input box in there is automatically made active...I'd rather not have that happen
[05:34:23] <raj> how can I prevent this?
[05:35:00] <Cork> raj: don't think you can
[05:35:04] <pachet> DannyZB: your lack of a fundational understanding of javascript is ruining your opensourcing plans
[05:35:09] <pachet> jesus is just a passive observer
[05:35:10] <Cork> its browser default behavior
[05:35:15] <raj> damn
[05:35:23] <Cork> you can put focus on another element
[05:35:28] <poppiez> pachet: thx a lot :)
[05:35:29] <raj> yes, I'd rather do that
[05:35:29] <pachet> *foundational, even
[05:35:36] <dannN> Cork: I thought i can write a class with MooTools Class and I can run the class only if i need it. So i've called the first class after both classes were included into the header
[05:35:46] <raj> Cork, how might I put it on an inanimate element?
[05:35:47] <NodeX> anyone know of a good drag/drop/sort plugin that isn't bloated
[05:35:49] <raj> such as a label
[05:36:07] <dannN> Cork: so there is no way. I've to include the first class, initialize the class and after this i've to include class2?
[05:36:13] <Cork> dannN: then you delay when you declare it
[05:36:21] <DannyZB> OK so if it's a lack of foundational knowledge .. then tell me .. why isn't the delay working ?
[05:36:26] <DannyZB> http://jsfiddle.net/EwfPQ/9/
[05:36:33] <DannyZB> obviously you're the big expert (:
[05:36:37] <Cork> dannN: sure there is, but you would have to wrap your code, and delay it
[05:36:56] <Cork> a callback system that is
[05:37:13] <Cork> dannN: but its almost imposible to give generic answers for this
[05:37:28] <Cork> it depends on how your code looks like and what it needs

[05:38:26] <asher^> how can i trigger html5 form validation when using javascript/jquery to submit a form?
[05:40:11] <Cork> asher^: you need to trigger the submit event on the form
[05:40:15] <Whirl3d> doesn't delay only affect items in the fx qeue?
[05:40:22] <Cork> asher^: and then prevent the default action
[05:40:31] <Cork> Whirl3d: it does
[05:40:39] <Cork> or rather yes
[05:40:57] <asher^> Cork ive done that, but it seems to skip the validation
[05:41:05] <pachet> DannyZB: because that's not what $(foo).delay is for
[05:41:12] <Cork> asher^: what browser?
[05:41:14] <pachet> it only affects the fx queue ( or whatever queue you're using)

[06:02:33] <shwaiil> pachet: thanks for looking. i'll do some testings!
[06:02:41] <raj> WHAT IN THE WORLD??? I'm console.logging()  an element, and THEN applying an attribute on the next line...and the console.log() output is showing it as though the attribute setting line was before it!!
[06:04:16] <pachet> raj: when you console.log(someObj), someObj is passed to the console as a ref
[06:04:27] <pachet> the obj on the heap that the ref points to gets updated (with the attribute) before the console can output
[06:04:54] <raj> why isn't it getting output with the value it was when console.log() was called?
[06:05:17] <DannyZB> ?s
[06:08:13] <pachet> raj: because console doesn't show the value
[06:08:20] <pachet> er,
[06:08:27] <pachet> it doesnt show the value at the time you call console.log
[06:08:34] <pachet> it retains a reference to the object that you pass in
[06:08:44] <raj> k, fine
[06:08:49] <raj> i don't like it one bit
[06:08:55] <raj> but fine
[06:08:57] <pachet> you can do console.log(JSON.stringify(myObj))
[06:09:14] <raj> oh, clever
[06:09:16] <pachet> to force it to output a string lit representing the value at that time
[06:10:35] <demetan> please I need to output variables from a jquery post to another functions out of the request ans jquery. how can i do this ?

[06:37:17] <peiper> someone expierienced with jquery UI sortable connected lists? i need an event when the item is dragged, sortdeactivate seems good but it gets fired multiple times?!?!?!
[06:38:03] <shwaiil> peiper: pastie, show code
[06:38:27] <peiper> shwaiil, gimme a second
[06:41:03] <Putr> pachet: Ye but that's not the most reliable way (IE 8+ only)
[06:41:33] <pachet> Putr: you have to shim it for ie<8 and early opera
[06:41:44] <pachet> but assuming you use the standard shim, the syntax is the same
[06:43:40] <peiper> shwaiil, http://jsfiddle.net/bgEMY/
[06:44:39] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/64833361
[06:45:00] <Nece228> how to make stop executing any code after the button press?
[06:45:43] <Nece228> so when i click the button, the image changes and the on mouseover function should no longer execute
[06:45:55] <peiper> you want to unbind the event?
[06:45:59] <peiper> or just disable?
[06:46:19] <Nece228> i think unbinding would be cleaner way?
[06:46:44] <pachet> Nece228: just add $(this).off('mouseover'); in your click handler
[06:46:57] <Nece228> oh....lemme try
[06:47:00] * Thoams joins IRC channels just so something moves on his terminal...
[06:47:09] <pachet> and it would actually be better if you stored $(this) in a variable within the handler
[06:47:19] <pachet> var $this = $(this); $this.doStuff()
[06:47:35] <Nece228> pachet: yeah but it messes stuff up.
[06:47:46] <pachet> define 'messes stuff up'
[06:48:16] <shwaiil> peiper: the function alert() is triggered 2 times, because you bind that nr of times to elements. In your case 2,  $(".lv_allowed, .lv_hidden").bind("sortdeactivate", function(event, ui){ ... }
[06:48:37] <shwaiil> peiper: maybe add a class name to common elements and just bind to this class name.
[06:48:39] <Nece228> you see i want on button press to change image, but dont change the location of the image when i click on it, with your method the image goes on random location on click, altough it shouldnt
[06:48:42] <shwaiil> peiper: did that helped ?
[06:49:08] <peiper> shwaiil, not really i got like 10 connected lists (always 2 pairs like in the fiddle)
[06:49:31] <peiper> shwaiil, should i give them all an exact id/name ?
[06:49:56] <shwaiil> peiper: no, but just add a class name and bind to that class name. so instead of binding twice, you only bind once
[06:50:32] <DannyZB> Guys , I'm building an opensource plug-in and want your opinion : is it better to integrate a login system in a file manager or create another system for the server to manage it ?
[06:50:41] <shwaiil> peiper: nah it doesnt work
[06:50:44] <shwaiil> tested :P
[06:51:10] <Nece228> pachet: so i tried your method, but when i press on image it still moves but only one time, then it no longer moves. i want that after the button press that function should be killed instantly
[06:51:40] <Nece228> i think thats because i hover on mouse before clicking the button so function has to be completed one more time
[06:51:52] <pachet> Nece288: unbind the mouseover event first, and return false
[06:53:27] <pachet> Nece288: i wouldn't expect the mouseover to fire after you unbind it though, even without doing anything to the event or default behavior
[06:53:30] <pachet> so i dunno
[06:55:16] <DannyZB> Lets see another vote : which would you find more useful , letting your users upload files or managing CDN files for your website ?
[06:55:25] <Thoams> wow, don't /list using irssi
[06:55:29] <Thoams> that sucked
[06:55:49] <thang> not on public servers at least
[06:57:09] <Thoams> I must be in a good mood: refraining from pithy responses to questions like that isn't like me at all...
[06:58:24] <peiper> shwaiil, the problem is that i need to put an AJAX request there (the state should be saved in the database)
[06:59:13] <peiper> shwaiil, creating that request 20 times per drag and drop will quickly trigger the server firewall^^
[06:59:20] <saba> Which approach will probably have the best performance? I'm basically having var t=$('ul#foo li'); and I'm doing $(t).removeClass('bar').filter(this).addClass('bar');. That is, I want to ensure that only the current li (this) has the class bar. I know that only one other li will have the class and thus have it removed. Would $('.foo', t).removeClass('foo'); $(this).addClass('foo') have better performance?
[06:59:26] <saba> Any third suggestion?
[07:02:26] <shwaiil> peiper: I couldn't find a solution. You need someone more advanced.
[07:02:57] <pachet> saba: yes, the second will have better performance
[07:03:11] <pachet> but the best you can do is to store the previously classed 'foo' element in a variable
[07:03:39] <peiper> shwaiil, thanks anyway
[07:03:58] <pachet> that said, doing 'var t = $(ul#foo li')' is redundant --> should just be $('#foo li') since id specification is the highest precedence
[07:04:12] <saba> pachet: it has better performance because I remove the class of all elements and then filter all of them once again?
[07:04:30] <saba> I am a somewhat redundant person. ;-)
[07:04:33] <Thoams> you're all... talking at each other and it's all a wishy washy mess of ascii and WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN!?
[07:04:49] <saba> It is indeed a good idea to store the current one in a variable, thus I don't have to filter the context again.
[07:04:54] * Thoams gets back in his cage and s'stfu.
[07:05:00] <saba> Thoams: hehe
[07:05:03] <pachet> saba: correct
[07:05:17] <saba> pachet: I'll do that, cache more. Thanks for the input
[07:05:23] <pachet> saba: yw :D

[07:06:50] <MrDoomBringer> Hey folks, I've got a quick question about the specifics of an AJAX Delete request
[07:07:25] <MrDoomBringer> When I run this script from Firebug, it's reporting that the data parameters are being dropped
[07:07:26] <mayhem93> how do I transform a jquery object into a DOMElement ?
[07:07:41] <warrenparsons> ?get @mayhem93
[07:07:41] <caniuse> warrenparsons: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[07:08:05] <DannyZB> warrenandsons whats up man
[07:08:13] <MrDoomBringer> $.ajax({url:"test.php", data:{"var":"val"}, type:"DELETE"});
[07:08:13] <warrenparsons> Sup DannyZB
[07:08:19] <pachet> leo-rj-br: just do 'table.find('tr')'
[07:08:24] <MrDoomBringer> It's looking like a bug in jQuery itself. Any thoughts?
[07:08:30] <warrenparsons> Try this again...
[07:08:32] <DannyZB> Waging war against jQuery plug-ins and GIT
[07:08:35] <warrenparsons> @mayhem93 ?get
[07:08:38] <warrenparsons> Crap
[07:08:45] <warrenparsons> Syntax...
[07:08:49] <pachet> that'd be

[07:08:53] <caniuse> mayhem93: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[07:09:00] <mayhem93> ok thanks :)

[07:09:25] <DannyZB> ?kill_all_humans @ DannyZB
[07:09:37] <Thoams> There's a damned good reason that 'git' is a perjorative.
[07:09:43] <Thoams> :)
[07:09:49] <NoiseEee> MrDoomBringer: if you're sending data to ajax and one of the variables is null or undefined, it will be dropped from the actual xhr request iirc
[07:10:32] <MrDoomBringer> NoiseEee: The data is not undefined or null.
[07:10:58] <NoiseEee> MrDoomBringer: recreate in jsfiddle if you can
[07:11:04] <MrDoomBringer> One moment
[07:13:23] <pachet> MrDoomBringer: what version of jquery are you using
[07:13:28] <MrDoomBringer> 1.7.2
[07:13:34] <pachet> hm
[07:13:43] <NoiseEee> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4018982/ajax-ignoring-data-param-for-delete-requests
[07:14:02] <NoiseEee> but thats an old version
[07:14:05] <pachet> NoiseEee: doesn't apply -- that's for jq<1.5
[07:14:05] <pachet> yeah
[07:14:10] <MrDoomBringer> That's a new version of the same request that I've seen
[07:14:24] <MrDoomBringer> There was apparently a change in 1.4.4 that allowed for it, this appears to have since been removed
[07:14:45] <MrDoomBringer> There was also a Git bug report on the same issue, I'm trying to track that down as well so I can reference it in a new bug report if I need to
[07:14:58] <varnie> good day.
[07:15:01] <MrDoomBringer> Apparently the RFC does allow for DELETE body parameters, jQuery just seems to be dropping them.
[07:15:36] <Ring0`> Hey. How do I use .is(:selected) with .on() ?
[07:15:42] <varnie> how can I read HTML5 custom attributes in jquery? smth like .metadata() do
[07:16:02] <varnie> I would like to get them all from current element.
[07:16:03] <pachet> varnie: $(foo).data()
[07:16:16] <pachet> will retrieve all data-*** attributes on the element
[07:16:31] <pachet> you can specify a specific suffix like $(foo).data('bar') to fetch data-bar
[07:16:35] <varnie> and will give me a hash as metadata() did?
[07:16:42] <pachet> yeah
[07:16:48] <varnie> thanks, I'll give it a try.
[07:18:18] <pachet> Ring0`: how do you mean :[
[07:19:00] <raj> how do I select any child (as many levels deep) of an element. So I can do if($targ.is($editbox.anychild())){blabla}
[07:19:02] <dirkpennings> somebody knows an image gallery swipe/snapper just like this? http://bit.ly/IXVTIJ (test on iPhone)
[07:21:03] <pachet> raj: if ( target.parents(someOtherElem).length ) ---> its resident within the parent
[07:21:12] <Ring0`> pachet: When page loads, jQuery selects some checkboxes, I would like to use function which can check if checkbox is selected.
[07:21:37] <Ring0`> normal .is(:selected) won't work since they were dynamicly selected, thereofre I need to use .on() but I can't make it work..
[07:21:42] <MrDoomBringer> So jsfiddle is having a fun time trying to run javascript functions from a button click and I'm not sure why.
[07:22:08] <raj> k, testing
[07:22:20] <pachet> Ring0`: .on() is for binding event handlers, not sure if that's what you want
[07:22:26] <MrDoomBringer> http://jsfiddle.net/2Tast/ You get the idea.
[07:23:46] <warrenparsons> Ring0`: if ( $(this).prop('checked') === true ) { … }
[07:24:04] <MrDoomBringer> Also, according to line 11 of the ajax.js code, DELETE is not in the noContent section
[07:24:06] <MrDoomBringer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.7.2/src/ajax.js#L11
[07:24:32] <warrenparsons> Ring0`: Actually, the equality check isn't needed. if ( $(this).prop('checked') ) { … } would work
[07:24:47] <Ring0`> warrenparsons: won't work as it was dynamicly selected.#
[07:25:04] <warrenparsons> Ring0`: What do you mean "dynamically selected?
[07:26:01] <Ring0`> warrenparsons: when page loaded, jquery selected couple checkboxes. source code doesn't have them selected.
[07:26:23] <warrenparsons> Ring0`: Doesn't matter. .prop() checks the current state of a property, not what's set in the source.
[07:26:29] <warrenparsons> ?prop @ Ring0`
[07:26:34] <GadonJ> hey guys

[07:28:04] <raj> pachet, for some reason, that appears to always return true
[07:28:08] <raj> no matter where I click

[07:30:21] <GadonJ> I'm trying to make that alert show on an Android browser
[07:30:29] <warrenparsons> Ring0`: Also, $(this).is(':checked') would also work. ":selected" didn't work because it's not a valid property on a checkbox.
[07:31:13] <Ring0`> oh.
[07:31:16] <Ring0`> t_t
[07:32:18] <Men_> Guys simple question I am selection optin value using .attr('selectedIndex',1); what I would like to do is check wheter selected index 1 exists
[07:32:21] <Men_> how to do that?
[07:33:05] <warrenparsons> Men_: This is in a select?
[07:33:32] <Men_> warrenparsons:  yes
[07:33:46] <warrenparsons> Men_: if ( $('#mySelect option').length > 0 ) { … }
[07:34:42] <warrenparsons> Men_: Actually, use > 1 because it's a zero-based index.
[07:35:17] <xec_> length will return the length, not an index
[07:35:35] <warrenparsons> xec_: I know, but he's checking the length to see if index "1" is present.
[07:35:58] <xec_> so you want > 2 ?
[07:36:20] <warrenparsons> xec_: if ( $('#mySelect option').length > 1 ) { // selectedIndex 1 is present }
[07:36:35] <xec_> seeing as index 1 will be the second member
[07:36:36] <raj> pachet, genious, it worked
[07:36:51] <raj> i was using a jquery object inside .parents() which was the mistake
[07:37:01] <pachet> raj: cool
[07:37:06] <warrenparsons> xec_: And > 1 means at least 2.
[07:37:09] <warrenparsons> Just a style thing.
[07:37:11] <raj> thank you :)
[07:37:11] <GadonJ> anyone able to look at my code?
[07:37:27] <GadonJ> I just want a page load event that works on android
[07:37:31] <sayakb> hi! is there a way i can traverse through each element in $('.class') and have jQuery methods available for them at the same time?
[07:37:59] <xec_> ah right
[07:38:13] <pachet> sayakb: $('.class').each(function(){$(this).doStuff();});
[07:38:43] <sayakb> pachet: thank you!
[07:38:53] <sayakb> i was trying $.each($tableFilter, function() { !

[07:39:30] <pachet> !
[07:39:31] <cangeceiro> could anyone lend some advice on the best way to utilize jquery.ui.draggable and have my draggable contained to multiple divs?
[07:40:10] <pachet> cangeciero: you can modify the parameters for the draggable dynamically
[07:40:12] <varnie> I have the following script: http://jsfiddle.net/nzTFd/7/ . What is the easier way to find these href items by their class?
[07:40:28] <pachet> so you'd probably want to change the container param to the new div when you mouseenter it
[07:41:19] <varnie> I mean, when we click 'yes' I have to take 'no' item and perform some manipulations and vice versa.
[07:41:23] <cangeceiro> that makes sense as far as choosing the containment DOM.  where I'm not to sure about yet is having my draggable in my containment div, and how to make the interaction where if i drag it out of that div it would only snap to a group of divs that have a specific class
[07:42:19] <MrDoomBringer> NoiseEee, pachet, did you guys have any last input before I submit this jQuery ticket?
[07:43:12] <NoiseEee> MrDoomBringer: nope, im not a dev, might as well file it and see what the resposne is
[07:43:13] <rubynfootball> where can I paste some code to get some help w/ it?
[07:43:21] <MrDoomBringer> Alright then. Thanks guys.
[07:43:36] <Trisox> ?paste
[07:44:00] <GadonJ> anyone? anyone at all?
[07:44:03] <rubynfootball> :trisox, what is ?paste
[07:44:14] <GadonJ> http://pastebin.com/s0kvFaqE
[07:44:21] <GadonJ> why is that not firing on an android browser
[07:44:52] <anli_> What is better than putting div inside a?
[07:45:18] <pachet> MrDoomBringer: late response, but no sorry :[
[07:45:42] <MrDoomBringer> It's fine. Ticket created successfully and my team can put this part of the API project on hold for now
[07:46:05] <MrDoomBringer> Hopefully we can get a resolution for this. I've found a workaround that involves *manually* appending the variables to the URL string but I really want to avoid that
[07:47:36] <pachet> MrDoomBringer: have a link for the ticket? i'd like to watch it
[07:48:57] <NoiseEee> MrDoomBringer: it sounds like you/your team should be able to patch that on your own, should you desire, no?
[07:49:09] <NoiseEee> MrDoomBringer: then you can submit that patch to core etc ya know
[07:49:15] <NoiseEee> contribute if you know what needs fixing :)
[07:50:31] <apeiros_> hi there. I use something akin $('<form action="…">…</form>').submit() - that works fine in safari, but firefox doesn't like it
[07:50:51] <apeiros_> to I really have to do $(…form…).hide().appendTo('body').submit() instead?
[07:50:57] <apeiros_> *do I…
[07:51:59] <rubynfootball> here is my pastbin:  pastebin.com/Y1BS0i2g  the jquery function on line 315 does nothing
[07:52:14] <Phinnay> hey! is it OK to ask plain ol javascript questions in here. the #javascript channel is pretty dead
[07:52:58] <rubynfootball> any ideas?
[07:53:05] <pachet> Phinnay: lies! i'm in there, ask away
[07:53:18] <pachet> oh, you did
[07:53:24] <pachet> </zzz>
[07:53:37] <Phinnay> yeah, sorry... i was in the wrong JS channel haha
[07:53:49] <rubynfootball> pachet:  any idea on my jquery question?
[07:55:03] <pachet> rubynfootball : just select the element by tag name, $('select')
[07:55:09] <pachet> *element(s)
[07:55:50] <warrenparsons> rubynfootball: There is no input of type "select." Select is its own element.
[07:56:22] <pachet> ^
[07:56:38] <MrDoomBringer> pachet, NoiseEee: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11586  My team might be able to pull it up and dig through it all, but we're not really paid to be debugging third party libraries ;)
[07:57:19] <pachet> MrDoomBringer: thank you sir
[07:57:20] <NoiseEee> MrDoomBringer: thats the thing about open source, nobody gets paid
[07:57:21] <NoiseEee> :)
[07:57:35] <NoiseEee> its not like the jquery devs are making any moneys
[07:57:47] <MrDoomBringer> If I get some free time (hah!) in the next week or two I might play with it on my own. I'm very new to JavaScript development so it would be a good learning experience
[07:58:05] <pachet> (not from writing jq explicitly, at least)
[07:58:15] <MrDoomBringer> I'm trained on C/C++/Assembly and working with microcontrollers. Web development is an.. interesting world.
[07:58:44] <pachet> MrDoomBringer: same with me, started in c++
[07:58:49] <MrDoomBringer> But yeah, I'll take a look at it if I get some time and try to contribute a bit.
[07:58:51] <pachet> like going from artillery lines to guerilla warfare
[07:59:04] <MrDoomBringer> Hah, an apt description.
[07:59:55] <rubynfootball> warrenparsons:, pachet:  it still does noting, no alert or error.  What could cause that?
[08:00:12] <rubynfootball> what else could be wrong?
[08:00:37] <warrenparsons> rubynfootball: Are you getting any errors in your console?
[08:00:37] <rubynfootball> http://pastebin.com/Y1BS0i2g
[08:01:18] <rubynfootball> warrenparsons:  warnings about stuff unrelated to this js function
[08:01:57] <merlin1991> according to the docs (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring) I'm doing everything right here: http://paste.debian.net/162990/ but still when I try to use that with $.wfcJsonPost(something) I get a  $.wcfJsonPost is not a function
[08:02:02] <warrenparsons> rubynfootball: An unrelated JS error can stop execution elsewhere.
[08:02:09] <merlin1991> $.fn.wcfJsonPost(something) works
[08:02:26] <rubynfootball> warrenparsons: I'll get rid of those errors first
[08:03:36] <warrenparsons> rubynfootball: You've still got $("INPUT:select") in your code. We've told you that won't work.
[08:04:46] <pachet> rubynfootball: beyond that, you're trying to access DOM elements before the dom is loaded, as per browser spec when you have scripts in <head> they will fire before the dom is fully enumerated
[08:05:19] <bmc> see ya
[08:05:29] <warrenparsons> Jeez
[08:05:37] <MrDoomBringer> NoiseEee: I stand corrected and so do you. I was just instructed to dig through jQuery and figure out if it's easy to fix. Looks like I'm getting paid to do open source work.
[08:05:39] <pachet> jquerians will tend to have you defer code execution by passing a fn into the document.load event, which you can do via $(function(){$('#element').doSomething();});
[08:05:58] <warrenparsons> rubynfootball: You really need to develop a good understanding of valid HTML and some jQuery basics.
[08:06:01] <pachet> but i prefer to put my dom-modifying <script>s before </body>
[08:06:11] <pachet> rubynfootball: also what warrenparsons said
[08:06:13] <NoiseEee> MrDoomBringer: :)
[08:18:42] <merlin1991> I've reduced my problem to a jsfiddler: http://jsfiddle.net/nYkgS/6/
[08:22:35] <xec_> merlin1991: are you actually trying to append text? or just demonstrating the $.pluginName() vs $.fn.pluginName() ?
[08:22:52] <merlin1991> the latter
[08:23:13] <merlin1991> my plugin does something completely unrelated (but works in itself) I just can't call it how I thought I should call it
[08:23:49] <merlin1991> so I wonder why?
[08:24:54] <merlin1991> according to the docs http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring I'm doing it perfectly fine :/
[08:25:01] <xec_> well, usually you execute the jquery function so you get a collection returned, like $("#text").addText("something")
[08:26:26] <xec_> if you don't want or need it to be in the context of a collection, i'm not sure how i would do it
[08:26:45] <xec_> the way you got it now you could execute it with $().addText("something")
[08:26:50] <GadonJ> anyone know why jquery mobile is adding a div to my page with an h1 in it that says "loading" ?
[08:27:36] <merlin1991> xec_: the plugin I wrote adds another ajax function, therefore I don't want it in the context of a collection :/
[08:27:55] <xec_> i'm guessing you could attach functions directly to $ as well, not sure if that's considered bad practice though
[08:28:24] <b-lew_> can I score some help, I have two plugins butting heads... problem is my filtering plugin clones the list fancy box... is there a way to fix this? can someone help walk me through that ?
[08:28:26] <xec_> like $.plugin = function(){...}
[08:28:27] <merlin1991> xec_: seems for colletions it works jsut fine: http://jsfiddle.net/nYkgS/8/
[08:29:27] <xec_> merlin1991: http://jsfiddle.net/nYkgS/9/
[08:30:10] <merlin1991> thanks xec_
[08:30:55] <GadonJ> anyone know why jquery is adding a div to my body with an h1 in it that says "loading"?
[08:31:37] <xec_> GadonJ: i doubt jquery (core) would do that, see ?demo
[08:31:47] <warrenparsons> GadonJ: You might have more luck trying in #jquerymobile
[08:31:59] <warrenparsons> xec_: He's getting it with Mobile.
[08:32:02] <xec_> i see
[08:34:38] <GadonJ> yeah its mobile
[08:38:43] <Lobster> hi... can anyone help me with what is going on at http://venturers.willhirsch.co.uk/photos with IE 9 in compatibility mode? lightbox.js is supposed to append a bunch of elements to the body, but it only appends the first one
[08:39:03] <sekretskwerl> hey guys, anybody ever done overrides on bootstrap's typeahead?
[08:40:03] <lunias> Hi, I'm using JQuery UI and I'm trying to get portlets to actually be part of the tabs panel rather than hovering over the top of it... Do I have to add a class to my columns / portlets to get it to work properly?
[08:41:08] <nights> hi
[08:41:10] <Lobster> ugh, never mind my question, figured it out as soon as I asked, typical
[08:41:18] <nights> im trying to figure out why this animation pans in from the left
[08:42:20] <nights> https://www.maishoku.com/
[08:42:22] <nights> heres the link
[08:44:02] <Lobster> nights: I don't get any animation on page load, am I supposed to click something?
[08:45:14] <lunias> Okay, the problem appears to be the column styling...
[08:46:45] <nights> Lobster: you cant see the map?
[08:46:49] <nights> oh
[08:46:52] <Lobster> yep
[08:46:55] <nights> what
[08:46:58] <nights> which browser?
[08:47:10] <Lobster> chrome
[08:47:15] <somasin> How can I stop my keypress handler from being executed inside my paste event handler?
[08:47:51] <somasin> (when people paste with keys it fires both events)
[08:48:41] <nights> Lobster: 20.0.1096.1 ?
[08:49:00] <Lobster> nights: yes
[08:49:04] <nights> strange.
[08:49:13] <nights> how about this
[08:49:20] <nights> https://www.maishoku.com/en/
[08:49:21] <lunias> Is there an alternative to float:left? It seems to be the issues.
[08:49:23] <johnkpaul> somasin: are you executing the same thing in both situations?
[08:49:29] <johnkpaul> paste isn't a native event
[08:49:41] <somasin> johnkpaul: yes I am
[08:50:01] <johnkpaul> so why do you need a separate paste handler?
[08:50:09] <nights> Lobster: when you load the page there is no map?
[08:50:14] <somasin> one way to make it not execute twice
[08:50:14] <nights> sounds too weird....
[08:50:25] <Lobster> sorry nights
[08:50:34] <Lobster> I missed the bit where you linked to the en version
[08:50:38] <somasin> johnkpaul: I need the seperate patse hanlder for mouse only pasting
[08:50:48] <nights> Lobster: its fine, but does it work better?
[08:50:51] <nights> cant imagine it would
[08:50:52] <Lobster> but yes, the en version has the map too
[08:50:55] <nights> oh
[08:51:03] <nights> but you can see it animates in from the left no?
[08:51:10] <nights> actually you can only load it once now
[08:51:15] <nights> so dont select anything
[08:51:16] <johnkpaul> somasin: this is a good example https://github.com/chrisdone/jquery-console/blob/master/jquery.console.js
[08:51:16] <Lobster> no
[08:51:52] <Lobster> the map just appears in the middle of the page for me
[08:52:00] <nights> Lobster: i see
[08:52:05] <nights> sometimes it like loads on the left side
[08:52:13] <nights> then when its finished loading it moves to the center
[08:52:20] <nights> its really ugly and i want to remedy it somehow
[08:53:25] <percoction> hello
[08:53:43] <percoction> i have a question
[08:53:55] <MacroMan> What is wrong with this very simple piece of code: http://jsfiddle.net/WbDKP/1/
[08:54:24] <percoction> if you register multiple .click() functions to an object, does the second registration override the first, or do they just keep stacking?
[08:54:27] <xec_> MacroMan: missing a {
[08:54:49] <MacroMan> xec_: Doh. Tahnks
[08:54:51] <xec_> or, an extra }
[08:54:58] <xec_> or a : instead of ,
[08:55:01] <MacroMan> An extra }. It wasn't meant to be there
[08:55:05] <xec_> depending on what way you wanna go :D
[08:56:15] <xec_> percoction: you can have multiple click handlers bound to the same element
[08:56:17] <warrenparsons> percoction: Are you asking if multiple bound click event handlers will overwrite or stack?
[08:56:37] <percoction> yes
[08:57:04] <percoction> so they dont overwrite then?
[08:57:17] <warrenparsons> percoction: No
[08:57:20] <xec_> try it and see :)
[08:57:32] <percoction> i didn't think so
[08:58:16] <MacroMan> Can I do an .animate() on an element that has position: fixed: ?
[08:58:40] <MacroMan> It doesn't seem to work. Just wondering if there is a work around
[08:59:37] <MacroMan> Ah, never mind. Was another error preventing it
[08:59:48] <Lobster> heh, it sounded pretty fishy
[09:01:12] * MacroMan traps Lobster in a trap
[09:01:28] <Lobster> :C
[09:08:27] <fatguy-ipad> Im looking for an in-depth jquery book. Anyone have suggestions?
[09:09:03] <direct3d> Peach Pit Press
[09:09:07] <superthebobfredm> Hey, all,  I'm trying to implement the blueimp drag-and-drop file uploader, but I keep getting "a.fn.modal" is undefined....    what can I do to work toward identifying the problem?
[09:09:28] <superthebobfredm> .... oh, and it's being done in an ajax modal
[09:09:44] <superthebobfredm> meaning the modal content is rendered from ajax....
[09:10:02] <fatguy-ipad> direct3d: Was that directed to me?
[09:11:44] <rroelofs> fatguy-ipad: if you are looking for a 'recipe' book  the book based on this site is good.  http://www.learningjquery.com/
[09:16:56] <percoction> warrenparsons: got it - gotta unbind the event first
[09:17:29] <fatguy-ipad> rroelofs: Thank you for that link! :)
[09:28:19] <b-lew_> hello again
[09:30:54] <b-lew_>  $('.image-grid_' + (i+1) ).fGallery('.filter_' + (i+1) ); -> is conflicting with fancybox and duplicating all my gallery images, is there a way to make this line of code more specific so they don't butt heads
[09:32:40] <sethduncan> morning'
[09:32:46] <sethduncan> mornin' ***
[09:33:09] <b-lew_> hey setduncan.
[09:33:17] <b-lew_> is there anyway i can score some help from you?
[09:33:30] <sethduncan> haha I can give it a shot, I was coming in for help as well. what's up?
[09:33:58] <b-lew_> oh okay haha.
[09:34:09] <b-lew_> well $('.image-grid_' + (i+1) ).fGallery('.filter_' + (i+1) ); -> is conflicting with fancybox and duplicating all my gallery images, is there a way to make this line of code more specific so they don't butt heads
[09:34:25] <b-lew_> I wouldn't think it would be terribly hard but I'm no expert trying to learn
[09:34:31] <mecode> there's a jquery plugin i used a long time ago, and i can't find it anywhere on google. basically, it gave you a lot of control on moving elements around (sliding in a frame or otherwise), so you could target an element and say "slide #div4 to the center" or something. i thought it was called "slideTo" or something, but i can't find it... ideas?
[09:35:04] <b-lew_> mecode: http://razorjack.net/quicksand/ ?
[09:35:06] <sethduncan> decode - try looking at scriptaculous
[09:35:10] <sethduncan> mecode*
[09:35:30] <sethduncan> blew - that's a tough call, I don't know fancy box well enough to see anything jumping out as a conflict.
[09:35:34] <sethduncan> lol...
[09:35:36] <sethduncan> b-lew **
[09:35:42] <sethduncan> I have got to stop typing so fast
[09:35:49] <b-lew_> lol
[09:35:54] <mecode> b-lew: no that's not it. i should have mentioned it is a very basic "plugin" and doesn't have a lot of stuff built in - it just gives you the ability to easily move things around
[09:36:33] <b-lew_> yea its just frustrating sethduncan. been trying to fix it for 2 days now. thought i'd check here for some help
[09:37:25] <b-lew_> I think the rel attribute is screwing something up not quite for sure though
[09:38:46] <b-lew_> If i comment out that line though they images don't duplicate but sorting galleries doesn't
[09:38:56] <b-lew_> can't get the best of both worlds
[09:39:03] <jonathancutrell> Who needs basic jQuery help? Let me know.
[09:39:16] <b-lew_> I do jobathacutrell haha
[09:39:17] <shoky> o.o
[09:39:39] <b-lew_> but it involves fancy box which no one seems to know very well
[09:40:30] <jonathancutrell> b-lew_: I've worked with fancy box before. Got a link for me?
[09:41:05] <b-lew_> yea, I do jonathancutrell... nervous to ask for help though... haven't had much luck.
[09:41:31] <b-lew_> http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/delinea.html#home_portfolio_botm_bg -> click on "image 1" 's icon
[09:41:35] <b-lew_> to get fancy box
[09:41:52] <b-lew_> the gallery is getting duplicated because of my sort feature...
[09:42:20] <b-lew_> seams as though if i comment out this line of code it fixes the duplication error but my sort feature doesn't work
[09:42:21] <b-lew_> $('.image-grid_' + (i+1) ).fGallery('.filter_' + (i+1) );
[09:43:01] <b-lew_> can't get the best of both worlds and I'm running out of ideas
[09:43:33] <jonathancutrell> Okay.
[09:43:34] <jonathancutrell> so.
[09:43:38] <jonathancutrell> where is the sort feature?
[09:44:11] <b-lew_> if you click on videos, pictures, text tags right by where it says "filter by"
[09:44:15] <b-lew_> thats the sort feature
[09:44:46] <b-lew_> and that code is in http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/js/script.js
[09:46:06] <jonathancutrell> So what's the purpose of the cloning?
[09:46:10] <jonathancutrell> as in,
[09:46:15] <jonathancutrell> are those elements used again?
[09:46:57] <b-lew_> Just in that sort functionality of that portfolio section... i'm no expert jonathancutrell forgive me, I'm learning though
[09:46:57] <jonathancutrell> one easy way to do it would be this
[09:47:28] <abnormalex> is there any git like repository that can be privatly hosted and that has a wiki for discussing projects?
[09:48:10] <jonathancutrell> after you call your sort (wherever that cloning happens), you can go in and remove the code that defines what gallery the pictures belong in just in the cloned pieces.
[09:48:53] <b-lew_> is that hard to do? jonathancutrell?
[09:49:15] <b-lew_> so once its in fancy box it will show all again.
[09:50:23] <jonathancutrell> so $("#grid-clone li span a").each(function(i,el){ $(el).attr("rel", "") });
[09:50:39] <ovnicraft> node.js
[09:50:53] <ovnicraft> sorry
[09:51:04] <jonathancutrell> b-lew_: Then you'd want to only bind to clicks that happen inside $("#image-grid")
[09:51:05] <b-lew_> haha wow, you are good jonathancutrell. I'm assuming i need to put that in my document ready statement ?
[09:51:20] <monk13> so im going through my mostly jquery/ajax app, and suddenly I noticed a line of code a confirm('Are you sure..?') js doesn't work. if i do confirm("Press a button"); in Firebug Console it just returns true in the console, (instead of asking me in a popup and returning that value)... is there a way to see what code is in the confirm function? who knows maybe i overwrote it in a global somewhere heh, but i doubt it.
[09:52:05] <jonathancutrell> monk13: Open your console in your browser and type "confirm"
[09:52:10] <johnkpaul> monk13: in firefox, window.confirm.toSource()
[09:52:16] <jonathancutrell> monk13: press enter.
[09:52:23] <jonathancutrell> monk13: yeah, what johnkpaul said.
[09:52:24] <johnkpaul> that's not a standard method on Function though
[09:52:28] <johnkpaul> so it'll only work in FF
[09:52:38] <monk13> TypeError: window.confirm.toSource is not a function
[09:52:51] <monk13> if i just type 'confirm' and Enter i get: function()
[09:52:52] <jonathancutrell> monk13: You could also do confirm("some string") and see what happens.
[09:53:02] <monk13> yeh it just returns true in Console
[09:53:16] <monk13> if i try to run the confirm.
[09:53:22] <monk13> confirm('test') i mean^
[09:53:45] <jonathancutrell> monk13: have you searched for it in your code? Like a project search for the confirm function?
[09:53:58] <johnkpaul> hm, you're in firebug, so you're in firefox
[09:54:03] <johnkpaul> .toSource should work on all functions
[09:54:18] <monk13> weird :)
[09:54:31] <monk13> let me try it on one of my functions to be sure. and also on a regular page.
[09:54:34] <b-lew_> thanks jonathancutrell, I'll keep trying
[09:54:42] <johnkpaul> are you on a not-regular page?
[09:54:43] <jonathancutrell> monk13: what version?
[09:55:13] <monk13> 10 something i bet. one sec
[09:55:22] <monk13> Firefox 11
[09:55:31] <jonathancutrell> monk13: url?
[09:55:36] <monk13> i tried in google.com
[09:56:00] <jonathancutrell> b-lew_: Basically you want to remove the thing that puts those cloned pieces in the same gallery,
[09:56:08] <monk13> vs in my app, where confirm("test") works landing on 1st landing page, but then somewhere later in ajax app stops working.
[09:56:16] <jonathancutrell> b-lew_: and THEN bind your click (do the .fancybox() call)
[09:56:20] <b-lew_> which would be rel I'm assuming
[09:56:36] <jonathancutrell> b-lew_: probably.
[09:57:05] <johnkpaul> monk13: later in ajax app?
[09:57:17] <b-lew_> okay, i'll try to figure that out thanks! I'll have to google what bind is but makes sense.
[09:59:08] <monk13> johnkpaul, like landing on the 1st page of app, i can run confirm("test") on console and it works as i expect. Its a regular page, with some js includes... Clicking Next button starts the ajax stuff...aka click the button, make an ajax call to get the next question in a questionaiire, replace the content of the page with that content. and so on. somewhere in the middle of this it stops working.
[09:59:48] <monk13> at that point, trying console("test") in the console, just returns true without asking anything.
[09:59:58] <johnkpaul> in the scripts tab of firefbug
[10:00:04] <johnkpaul> search for the word confirm
[10:00:50] <monk13> k, i'll look now
[10:02:56] <b-lew_> this problem blows haha.
[10:05:26] <Teduardo> Howdy, can anyone help me out with a bit of example code I am trying to get working? http://pastebin.com/kkUmkhbq I need it to display the right div when the page loads AND when the page changes..
[10:05:43] <tomasm-> is there a way to see what the code is of an event handler (ie click), so I can diagnose what it's doing wrong? I can't rely upon the html code to see what it is because it's interpreted via ajax parsing (eval)
[10:06:18] <tomasm-> i'd like to see the actual lines of code to see exactly what it's doing.... I see the data('events').click object, but it's got a bunch of functions I dont know where to look
[10:06:52] <monk13> johnkpaul, only thing i found was var x = confirm("Are you sure you want to edit your answer to this question?"); and many references to a local var: confirm_email (which i changed from var confirm just to make sure its not a global var overwriting confirm function )... dont think ToSource works on regular browser functions, so seems like the browser function is stilll there and not overwritten... yet its not working as expected heh.
[10:07:20] <monk13> Maybe I can put an example up publically to try out... [but can't do that yet in my organization].
[10:08:12] <f3rr31r4> how can i display a link when i click ?  var msg = ' <a href="{User.show(11)}">view</a>'; $("#eventMessage").text(msg);
[10:08:31] <shoky> Teduardo make a named function and call it from both places
[10:08:42] <f3rr31r4> can some one tell me
[10:08:44] <f3rr31r4> thanks
[10:09:49] <Teduardo> shoky: hmm, I'm not actually calling that code currently it basically just says when #ptype changes do (xyz) but I also need it to do (xyz) when the page loads so that it shows the correct default view
[10:11:00] <johnkpaul> monk13: confirm could be shadowed if you're calling it from some internal function
[10:11:09] <johnkpaul> but if you're in the console, it should be using the global object, window
[10:11:37] <c0defr3ak> hello
[10:11:41] <shoky> tomasm-, .data('events').click is an array of the event handlers
[10:11:57] <shoky> tomasm-, so to see the code for the first handler: .data('events').click[0].handler
[10:14:35] <monk13> johnkpaul, it *might* be a weird issue involving Selenium IDE... i am using that to use a saved Test Case to go 'far' into my ajax app/questionairre... confirm seems to work when im not using Selenium.
[10:14:53] <monk13> (gonna confirm that again now)
[10:16:30] <johnkpaul> oh! monk13, I didn't realize you were using selenium
[10:16:34] <johnkpaul> what driver are you using?
[10:16:39] <monk13> yes that seems to be it...
[10:16:41] <johnkpaul> firefoxdriver?
[10:16:46] <johnkpaul> selenium can be a pain
[10:17:03] <shoky> Teduardo i dunno what you mean
[10:17:53] <shoky> what's the problem with the solution i gave?
[10:17:53] <monk13> johnkpaul,  I am using the Selenium IDE within Firefox (1.7.2 )... my first thing is: [command: Open, target: /my-app]  ... if i use this to goto my app landing page...
[10:18:10] <monk13> then run console("test"). it doesnt work. but manually going there and then trying it in console works.
[10:18:33] <monk13> So its a selenium issue.

[10:19:12] <wuwoot> Can someone please tell me how I can replace the contents within a div element tied to an anchor link? For example: I have two links, 'United States' and 'Canada', and I want a div element right below it to show the states/provinces depending on the link that is clicked on.
[10:19:50] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @wuwoot
[10:20:08] <wuwoot> johnkpaul: not familiar with it, but let me look that up. thanks.
[10:20:36] <johnkpaul> hmm, sorry, that was supposed to have the bot tell you something
[10:20:46] <jmccullough> Hi all. I'm making a plugin that alters the html of a table. However, whenever I run $("table").html() again, its as if it never changed
[10:20:49] <johnkpaul> wuwoot: we can help much more effecitvely if you give us a live example of your issue
[10:20:51] <f3rr31r4> how can i display a link when i click ?  var msg = ' <a href="{User.show(11)}">view</a>'; $("#eventMessage").text(msg);
[10:21:08] <johnkpaul> f3rr31r4: .html, not .txt
[10:21:11] <monk13> johnkpaul, the only difference is *i think* they are actually testing a Selenium test case for a confirm alert probably in Java... i am doing it within the Firefox IDE plugin so i can get to a certain point in my app and try some random stuff {like clicking Edit button which brings a Confirm alert},... so confirm itself doesn't work in the browser.
[10:21:29] <monk13> i'll google. maybe there's no solution for my specific problem.
[10:21:33] <johnkpaul> monk13: yeah, I know what you mean, but I don't know what to do...check #selenium
[10:21:38] <monk13> k
[10:22:04] <monk13> Thanks again for following along with me debug this funkyness :)
[10:22:14] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[10:22:29] <f3rr31r4> johnkpaul comes as text :(
[10:22:30] <shoky> jmccullough we need to see your code/a live example
[10:22:56] <johnkpaul> f3rr31r4: what do you mean? change your .text() to .html() and it should work
[10:23:07] <jmccullough> jmccullough: Will fiddle it :)
[10:23:14] <f3rr31r4> var msg2 = '<a href="{User.show(11)}">view</a>'; $("#eventMessage").html(msg2);
[10:23:18] <f3rr31r4> :(
[10:23:23] <f3rr31r4> comes as text
[10:23:56] <f3rr31r4> johnkpaul lol ctr + s
[10:23:59] <f3rr31r4> missing :P
[10:24:08] <johnkpaul> hahahaa

[10:24:30] <johnkpaul> f3rr31r4: find an editor that autosaves
[10:24:38] <f3rr31r4> johnkpaul how can i join text and html?
[10:24:47] <f3rr31r4> johnkpaul using eclipse
[10:24:54] <johnkpaul> join?
[10:25:06] <f3rr31r4> string + link
[10:25:32] <shoky> Teduardo you declare the doChangeThings function inside another function
[10:25:42] <johnkpaul> .html(string+link)?
[10:26:28] <ShooterMG> trying to use jquery.load() to load some html content that includes <script> tags. from what I'm seeing, any code within these tags definitely gets executed. But if I have a tag like <script src="myscript.js"></script>, then "myscript.js" doesn't seem to be available to any of the code within the other <script> tags. any ideas?
[10:26:28] <f3rr31r4> humm... 3 sec ;)
[10:26:38] <shoky> Teduardo and then you call it from the global scope
[10:26:38] <Teduardo> shoky: are you saying I should do that, or that is what I am doing incorrectly?
[10:26:51] <shoky> declare that function outside
[10:27:18] <shoky> and you should be calling it from inside the dom ready handler
[10:28:01] <shoky> (and from inside the change handler)
[10:28:14] <f3rr31r4> johnkpaul thanks
[10:28:25] <johnkpaul> no problem f3rr31r4
[10:28:49] <Teduardo> shoky: so? http://pastebin.com/SKmY71G3
[10:29:11] <jmccullough> Can someone check why my console output is outputting the same html after I change it? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/580232/
[10:29:22] <jmccullough> It's a little table sorter, just click a table header

[10:29:52] <shoky> Teduardo yes, but what is that $(this) supposed to be?
[10:30:30] <blankstare> hi guys.  i'm trying to create an event handler when an element's attribute changes as part of a separate plugin, but having a hard time pinning down the event type.  Any suggestions?
[10:31:50] <wuwoot> somebody wanna help me out with figuring out the jquery needed to accomplish the following? I have two country anchor links that need to pop out a div containing the states in the event of a click and this is what I have -- http://jsfiddle.net/rz7xx/
[10:31:55] <Teduardo> shoky: sorry I don't follow, this is example code that someone gave me to try and edit for them =|
[10:31:58] <johnkpaul> wuwoot: http://jsfiddle.net/rz7xx/1/
[10:32:06] <wuwoot> johnkpaul: thanks lemme take a look
[10:32:48] <ShooterMG> i have an external HTML page that has two script tags. one is simply <script src="swfobject.js"></script>, and the other one contains a bunch of JS to actually make use of swfobject.js.  My problem is when I use jquery.load on this page, it says swfobject.js can't be found
[10:33:12] <defaultro_> hey folks, I need some help here - http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/         I cannot hide the command. It is shown on the webpage
[10:33:16] <shoky> Teduardo the $(this) won't work when it's called from inside the ready handler
[10:33:24] <shoky> Teduardo: http://pastebin.com/3NHCuwPx
[10:33:35] <shoky> Teduardo: you need to add the ID there though
[10:33:36] <defaultro_> the codes are in color yellow
[10:33:47] <wuwoot> johnkpaul: what about having the states pop out only when somebody clicks on it? and the subsequent provinces only when somebody clicks on a state?
[10:33:59] <johnkpaul> wuwoot: :) that wasn't your question
[10:34:05] <johnkpaul> you need to add that
[10:34:14] <wuwoot> johnkpaul: yea, sorry -- not so great at describing
[10:34:27] <johnkpaul> so I gave you the template to work off of
[10:34:39] <johnkpaul> now you can add html elements after it's been clicked, after the anchor tag
[10:34:54] <[jasper]> hej guys, if I have http://pastebin.com/cJXd0hMZ <-- that pastebin.....will the function be re-added everytime the button is clicked ? or just once?
[10:35:27] <Cork[home]> [jasper]: every time
[10:35:37] <shoky> Teduardo i think maybe this is what you want: http://pastebin.com/dJkpXcJ1
[10:35:50] <[jasper]> really Cork[home] ....this feels wrong somehow...
[10:35:58] <Cork[home]> ?.one @ [jasper]
[10:36:08] <Cork[home]> sigh
[10:36:11] <[jasper]> well...one only works when the function is actually executed
[10:36:15] <[jasper]> right?
[10:36:21] <Cork[home]> [jasper]: check the .one() function
[10:36:25] <[jasper]> I allready did
[10:36:29] <[jasper]> hence my question
[10:36:37] <Cork[home]> yes its when its triggered
[10:36:45] <[jasper]> so if it isn't triggered and I press button gain
[10:36:49] <[jasper]> it gets re-added?
[10:36:51] <Cork[home]> correct
[10:37:02] <[jasper]> so then .one wouldn't really help me out here
[10:37:10] <[jasper]> right?
[10:37:20] <Cork[home]> bind the listner ones and use a value to check if it should work
[10:37:33] <Teduardo> shoky: hmm the last example you posted doesn't show the div when the #ptype select changes
[10:38:03] <Cork[home]> [jasper]: or if the cancel button is inside the popup, its prob hidden anyway
[10:38:09] <shoky> Teduardo i am just guessing at what you're trying to achieve..
[10:38:11] <[jasper]> yeah it is hidden
[10:38:17] <Cork[home]> then just bind it and let it be
[10:38:20] <[jasper]> but it somehow feels wrong to have code going around which isn't used
[10:38:29] <[jasper]> mybe I should unbind it manually?
[10:38:35] <Cork[home]> its actually more efficient
[10:38:37] <[jasper]> after the pop-up disappears
[10:38:38] <shoky> Teduardo maybe this? http://pastebin.com/ETxyea4d
[10:38:42] <Cork[home]> so just bind it and let it be
[10:38:52] <[jasper]> hmm ... you get why this feels wrong to me?
[10:38:57] <Cork[home]> not really
[10:39:21] <[jasper]> baiclly I have functions binded to elements...which maybe don't even exist anymore?
[10:39:27] <Teduardo> shoky: there is a dropdown in a form called 'ptype' when that form changes it should show the div that has the same value as the select for example if the select = cc it should show div cc or if the select = pp it should show the div pp
[10:39:48] <Cork[home]> [jasper]: uh if you remove the cancel element the listner is removed
[10:40:01] <shoky> Teduardo, and what about when the dom is ready?
[10:40:11] <Cork[home]> [jasper]:  the bind once only works if you just hide it
[10:40:12] <shoky> and did you try my last paste
[10:40:29] <Teduardo> the problem I was having with the code was that there was that when the page loads the first time it doesn't show the right div no matter what the value of ptype == in the form
[10:40:55] <[jasper]> yeah Cork[home] I see what you mean
[10:41:10] <[jasper]> but for example;....if I wnt to have a onkeydown with escpe to hide a popup
[10:41:20] <[jasper]> I need to unbind tht onkeydown when the pop-up is hidden
[10:41:25] <[jasper]> or remove the complete pop-up
[10:41:38] <Cork[home]> or just check if the dialog is visible
[10:41:50] <Cork[home]> or bind make the popup so it can have focus
[10:41:59] <Teduardo> shoky: i am checking it out now.
[10:42:00] <Cork[home]> (and bind the keydown on it)
[10:42:02] <[jasper]> true, BUT...
[10:42:09] <[jasper]> the keydown binds to the complete page...not to the popup
[10:42:20] <Cork[home]> it binds on elements that can have focus
[10:42:30] <[jasper]> cn I bind it to a div too?
[10:42:32] <Cork[home]> yes
[10:42:37] <[jasper]> hmm
[10:42:43] <[jasper]> how will I know if the div has focus?
[10:42:43] <Cork[home]> if you give them the tabindex="0"
[10:43:01] <[jasper]> if the div is visible it has focus?
[10:43:04] <Cork[home]> no
[10:43:15] <Cork[home]> its focus the same as if you click in a text field
[10:43:27] <shoky> Teduardo actually maybe this is better: http://pastebin.com/hXK7Xr5J  ;)
[10:43:35] <Cork[home]> [jasper]:  if you make the div focusable you can put the focus on it
[10:44:21] <[jasper]> Cork[home] ...imagine I put the on keydown on the div...and the div has input boxes on it...when a input box is selected and the user presses escape...the focus is on the input field right?
[10:44:33] <[jasper]> hence the onkeydown on the div won't work then?
[10:44:34] <[jasper]> or?
[10:44:43] <Cork[home]> the keypress will bubble if you don't prevent that
[10:44:51] <[jasper]> bubble?
[10:45:02] <Cork[home]> dom events bubble from child to parent
[10:45:12] <Teduardo> shoky: that seems to work exactly as I want it to
[10:45:13] <Cork[home]> or propagate if you prefer that term
[10:45:18] <[jasper]> ah
[10:45:23] <[jasper]> so the keydown will still get called then
[10:45:27] <Cork[home]> yes
[10:45:34] <shoky> Teduardo groovy
[10:45:40] <Teduardo> shoky: the reason this was such a pain is because if the user is filling out the form and they click back it would never show them what they typed in
[10:45:48] <Teduardo> on the previous page
[10:45:50] <[jasper]> that's funny...because if I then destroy the div....the keydown also disappers..
[10:45:57] <Cork[home]> yes
[10:45:59] <[jasper]> nice nice
[10:46:02] <[jasper]> this solves my problem
[10:46:43] <held> #c++
[10:46:44] <Teduardo> shoky: are there any major caveats you can think of to this approach like it will format my c:\ drive?
[10:48:10] <shoky> uhmm. seems fine ;p
[10:49:29] <Teduardo> You never know =)
[10:49:41] <Teduardo> Let me know if you need some $$ for helping me out
[10:50:15] <shoky> $$ is always needed. but i'm not here for that
[10:50:31] <shoky> thanks though
[10:50:43] <Teduardo> okay well i have like 500 other things I need done javascript wise so hit me up PM if you're interested lol =)
[10:51:19] <shoky> i think that might get you some PMs. ~1000 people here
[10:51:22] <shoky> ;P
[10:51:25] <f3rr31r4> how to get data.id http://pastebin.com/kzAiB9Gp
[10:51:50] <jonathancutrell> Teduardo: And most of them are looking for money.
[10:51:51] <johnkpaul> f3rr31r4: you need + around it
[10:52:05] <johnkpaul> you need to concatenate the strings
[10:52:07] <f3rr31r4> the link comes as +data.id+
[10:52:26] <held> uhu
[10:52:31] <johnkpaul> not in the example you just sent
[10:52:33] <johnkpaul> in the pastebin
[10:52:33] <johnkpaul> f3rr31r4:
[10:53:34] <f3rr31r4> "<a href="+"@{Projects.show("+data.id+")}>view</a>";
[10:54:57] <f3rr31r4> comes as http://localhost:9001/projects/show?id=%2B+data.id+%2B
[10:55:42] <alexr2> uhh.... what language are you running this on? :-P
[10:56:21] <f3rr31r4> <alexr2> why?
[10:57:18] <alexr2> try doing a parseInt(data.id)
[10:57:24] <WebDragon> on http://360.client-proof.com/contact/ I'm still having an issue with getting IE9 to properly display the various inputboxes with the rounded corners -- despite the fact that the linear-gradient is working just fine
[10:57:36] <alexr2> actually
[10:57:37] <alexr2> no
[10:57:44] <alexr2> don't put quotes around the data.id
[10:58:13] <f3rr31r4> <alexr2>  ???
[10:58:41] <johnkpaul> f3rr31r4: what framework is doing this interpolation?
[10:58:54] <f3rr31r4> play framework
[10:58:54] <alexr2> blah i got it
[10:58:56] <johnkpaul> javascript won't conver @{}
[10:58:58] <johnkpaul> ah
[10:59:01] <WebDragon> I've got jquery adding .roundedinput class to all of them, which has the correct behaviour:url(/PIE.htc); attached to that class
[10:59:03] <alexr2> you're compiling something
[10:59:16] <alexr2> data.id isn't a variable when you're compiling, it's a string
[10:59:20] <johnkpaul> f3rr31r4: you need to ask play how to concatthings
[10:59:26] <johnkpaul> in their templating language
[10:59:31] <johnkpaul> oh wait
[10:59:33] <johnkpaul> you can't even do that
[10:59:34] <WebDragon> additionally the fix I implemented to add the magnifier to Firefox (due to how css('background') isn't cross-browser-compatible didn't also fix it for IE9
[10:59:37] <WebDragon> which I thought strange
[10:59:44] <johnkpaul> that is converted to html on the server side, you can't use a js variable there
[10:59:51] <johnkpaul> perhaps find/replace on the client
[10:59:51] <alexr2> ^^
[11:00:20] <f3rr31r4> <johnkpaul probably
[11:00:30] <WebDragon> the lack of rounded corners on these is really contrasting with the appearance of the site on IE :/
[11:00:37] <alexr2> var msg2 = "<a href="+"@{Projects.show('')}"+data.id+">view</a>";
[11:00:38] <alexr2> try that
[11:01:43] <GarciaWebDev> ´morning
[11:02:04] <f3rr31r4> <alexr2> +1 ;)
[11:02:10] <f3rr31r4> it works well
[11:02:14] <alexr2> it's kind of a hacky way of doing it
[11:02:28] <GarciaWebDev> is there any way of binding a event once but keeping it bound?
[11:02:33] <f3rr31r4> thanks <alexr2> and <johnkpaul>  +1 for voice LOL
[11:02:42] <GarciaWebDev> .one() doesn´t keeps the bind
[11:02:52] <heldndd> #c++
[11:02:53] <alexr2> ?bind@GarciaWebDev
[11:03:00] <alexr2> oO
[11:03:02] <alexr2> is bot-t not here?
[11:03:14] <alexr2> http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[11:04:18] <GarciaWebDev> I used .on() and .bind() and both attach multiple handlers to a event
[11:04:31] <johnkpaul> f3rr31r4: no problem
[11:04:33] <alexr2> then you're binding it more than once
[11:04:40] <GarciaWebDev> is there any method that attaches only one handler per event?
[11:04:40] <alexr2> as in, in multiple locations
[11:04:46] <johnkpaul> f3rr31r4: it might be worthwhile to look into js templating solutions
[11:04:57] <GarciaWebDev> yes, sorry, multiple executions of the same code
[11:05:09] <GarciaWebDev> but I need only one handler call
[11:05:28] <alexr2> hmm... i don't know of a bindonce type method, but i guess you could unbind each time before you bind
[11:06:09] <alexr2> best way to do it is to rewrite your code so that the bind event doesn't happen more than once
[11:07:23] <GarciaWebDev> @alexr2 thanks, then i´ll do that
[11:07:32] <alexr2> there's another option
[11:07:40] <GarciaWebDev> @alexr2 thanks, then i´ll do that: unbind before bind
[11:07:41] <alexr2> set a global variable along the lines of is_bound
[11:07:49] <alexr2> set it to true once you bind the first time
[11:08:01] <alexr2> and check every time if it's true before binding again
[11:08:09] <alexr2> that's probably less costly in the long run
[11:08:16] <GarciaWebDev> hmm, maybe i´ll mess that way... there are many events
[11:08:39] <c0defr3ak> hey i am using a supersize slider and want to add related content for each image
[11:08:39] <GarciaWebDev> the thing is that i´m using a router based on fragments/hashes
[11:08:48] <GarciaWebDev> (jquery router)
[11:08:49] <c0defr3ak> can someone help me with that please?
[11:09:04] <GarciaWebDev> and that router opens a modal
[11:09:09] <GarciaWebDev> then i bind the events
[11:09:19] <GarciaWebDev> when on that route
[11:09:35] <GarciaWebDev> but i can close the modal (that exits the route)
[11:09:53] <GarciaWebDev> and then open it again (re-enter the route) and everything get´s executed again
[11:09:58] <GarciaWebDev> and the modal opens
[11:10:07] <GarciaWebDev> (uh, sorry for flood)
[11:10:41] <alexr2> GarciaWebDev, set up a hash table that stores the flag
[11:11:22] <alexr2> that way you can just check if (bound_table[hastag_set]  === true) return;
[11:12:18] <GarciaWebDev> alexr2: thanks
[11:12:59] <alexr2> no problem
[11:13:01] <alexr2> c0defr3ak what help do you need...
[11:13:16] <xSmurf> hello, how would one bind and event on bootstrap dropdown menu closing??

[11:14:26] <c0defr3ak> i am using supersized slider but cannot add related content for each image
[11:14:53] <alexr2> c0derfr3ak, use jsfiddle.net to show us the code you have and any problems you're having with it
[11:15:08] <b-lew1> I have 2 plugins butting heads can I grab some help with line of code that is screwing everything up?
[11:15:15] <c0defr3ak> basically i need something like bain.com
[11:16:26] <DannyZB> xsmurf? smurf was taken ?
[11:16:33] <alexr2> c0derfr3ak, we don't really do coding for you... we help you with issues or questions you have with your own code...
[11:16:46] <sphinxxx> how do you check if something is defined or undefined,  not true/false
[11:16:55] <alexr2> if (varname == undefined)
[11:17:10] <sphinxxx> its a regex expression
[11:17:29] <sphinxxx> if(window.location.href.match('.com/collection/')){
[11:17:32] <direct3d> I bet them peoples on IRC will make this for me for free
[11:17:50] <c0defr3ak> i dont want u to code for me or nething but if u can just suggest what kind of slider i can use in this scenario
[11:17:53] <rosascarlatta> ciao a tt
[11:17:54] <xSmurf> sphinxxx: use the test() method
[11:18:03] <rosascarlatta> !list
[11:18:16] <c0defr3ak> it would be really helpful ...i am just starting off with jquery..dont really know much about it
[11:18:18] <xSmurf> sphinxxx: and what you have in match isn't a regular expression
[11:18:20] <direct3d> Why don't you just modify the HTML & jQuery
[11:18:27] <xSmurf> it should be but right now you have only a string
[11:18:30] <direct3d> and add the content
[11:18:38] <xSmurf> if you want to test for a string use indexOf
[11:19:18] <snuggs> i need help with something somoene.  I have a div with a span that I am using to close the div.  It works on this site http://warm1013.com/keurig/  however will not work on when placed in the wordpress platform.  http://warm1013.com/contests/keurig/  can someone tell me where my error is?
[11:19:31] <alexr2> c0derfr3ak, there are a lot of jquery carousels that can do that. just google jquery carousel and read through the documentation
[11:20:05] <l3ck> snuggs: you know this is the jQuery channel right?
[11:20:32] <snuggs> l3ck: yes I am using jquery
[11:20:47] <snuggs> I'm looking for my error with the simple jquery I am using
[11:20:52] <IconicSchema> a div with a span your using to close the div...?
[11:20:54] <alexr2> "when placed in a wordpress platform" kind of specifies that it's a wordpress issue
[11:21:07] <l3ck> agreed
[11:21:11] <IconicSchema> oh lol
[11:21:12] <alexr2> does it work fine in a non-wordpress site?
[11:21:23] * IconicSchema facepalms...
[11:21:55] <snuggs> l3ck: I think it has something to do with the script I wrote
[11:22:06] <l3ck> pastebin it
[11:22:07] <snuggs> I am not jquery savy yet
[11:22:14] <b-lew1> haha IconicSchema hi!
[11:22:15] <direct3d> If it works outside of Wordpress
[11:22:18] <direct3d> and you port it into Wordpress
[11:22:20] <alexr2> ew pastebin :-P  jsfiddle :-P
[11:22:22] <direct3d> it's because another script is interfering
[11:22:28] <l3ck> haha whatever
[11:22:33] <IconicSchema> hey
[11:22:40] <l3ck> gist it
[11:22:43] <l3ck> something
[11:22:56] <c0defr3ak> this is supersized css n js http://jsfiddle.net/GJdt5/1/
[11:23:14] <snuggs> l3ck: http://jsfiddle.net/sezAL/
[11:23:53] <alexr2> snuggs, jsfiddle is made so that javascript, html, and css are separated out
[11:23:57] <alexr2> makes it a lot easier to figure things out
[11:24:08] <jonathancutrell> useless and fun: http://jsfiddle.net/jcutrell/BY6WE/9/
[11:24:11] <jonathancutrell> :)
[11:24:21] <alexr2> hahahaha that made me laugh ^^
[11:24:27] <snuggs> l3ck: http://jsfiddle.net/sezAL/
[11:24:31] <snuggs> sorry
[11:24:41] <snuggs> l3ck:  do you have a public pastebin?
[11:25:52] <snuggs> l3ck: http://pastebin.com/GvzqFqP3
[11:26:03] <l3ck> snuggs: uh... sorry i don't understand the question. is pastebin not public? doesn't matter though, jsfiddle works great too
[11:26:38] <snuggs> I'm just trying to figure out where my error lies in the jquery
[11:27:02] <alexr2> it works for me
[11:27:05] <l3ck> snuggs: your jQuery is fine as far as i can tell
[11:27:06] <alexr2> just sayin :-P
[11:27:09] <jonathancutrell> Yo dog. I heard you like js fiddle. So I put a js fiddle inside your js fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/jcutrell/EEq7B/2/
[11:27:10] <l3ck> its so simple
[11:27:31] <l3ck> jonathancutrell: INCEPTION
[11:27:34] <snuggs> l3ck: do you see any difference here http://warm1013.com/contests/keurig/
[11:28:17] <l3ck> snuggs: pop open a set of developer tools, I get "Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function"
[11:28:34] <l3ck> then "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <"
[11:29:13] <l3ck> is this stuff you're pasting into the WP page editor or is it in your theme files?
[11:29:28] <l3ck> because the WP editor will do weird things all day every day
[11:30:45] <l3ck> try changing it to jQuery(function($){ }) instead of your $(document).ready block
[11:30:50] <snuggs> l3ck: is the jquery being used on the site too old of a version to use $ should jquery be used instead?
[11:30:53] <l3ck> there's a $.noConflict later down the page
[11:31:06] <l3ck> no it might be the noConflict though
[11:31:28] <l3ck> noConflict smashes on the $ var
[11:34:30] <snuggs> l3ck: what do you use to see the error?  firebug or chrome inspector?
[11:34:42] <l3ck> chrome inspector
[11:38:53] <c0defr3ak> here is another one i am working on http://pastebin.com/pMJ4PaFW trying to add the fullsize background image behind the slider but do not know how to implement that
[11:40:51] <l3ck> alright so that whole pssh moment about pastebin was totally deserved...
[11:41:32] <gataraid> www.bottomsound.com I got the animation to work but how do I get it to center like the CSS instructs it to
[11:47:08] <W3Geek> I have a question to ask, is the code jQuery or JavaScript? $("nav a").mouseenter(function() { audio.play(); });
[11:47:29] <W3Geek> I'm thinking its jQuery.
[11:47:31] <gataraid> marginLeft: auto doesn't work
[11:47:37] <gataraid> W3Geek jquery
[11:48:31] <gataraid> www.bottomsound.com - I'm trying to animate the Logo into the center of the document
[11:48:36] <gataraid> How would I got about doing that?
[11:48:46] <gataraid> I've tried marginLeft: auto, marginRight: auto
[11:48:50] <gataraid> and setting the width and height
[11:48:53] <gataraid> It doesn't work out at all
[11:50:09] <gataraid> marginLeft: "auto" doesn't work
[11:50:10] <W3Geek> Thanks @gataraid, I was wondering how the anonymous function is assigned to the event. In JavaScript it would be assigned like document.getElementById("navID").onmouseover = function () { audio.play(); }; right?
[11:50:38] <gataraid> W3Geek something like that, yes
[11:51:15] <gataraid> the jquery channel isn't as active as others it seems
[11:51:51] <W3Geek> hmm, so in jQuery the function is being passed correct?
[11:52:05] <W3Geek> While JavaScript, its being assigned.
[11:52:54] <danzik17> jQuery is written in JavaScript.  that's not the right comparison.  you could do the same thing in pure javascript using .addEventListener or .attachEvent (IE)
[11:53:27] <l3ck> W3Geek: yeah, you'd do something like $('navID').on('mouseenter', function(){ something(); });
[11:54:43] <letterpress> gataraid try just "left"
[11:54:59] <W3Geek> I'm not really smart with event listeners, I was just curious how this syntax works... $("nav a").mouseenter(function () { });
[11:55:31] <l3ck> http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[11:55:36] <W3Geek> Why isn't it, $("nav a").mouseenter = function () { };
[11:55:39] <danzik17> W3Geek: functions are first-class on javascript, they can be passed around like any other object, which is why that works
[11:56:01] <danzik17> W3Geek: using that method, you could only ever have 1 handler
[11:56:58] <W3Geek> hmm I always think of assigning functions to handlers.
[11:58:02] <W3Geek> l3ck: I read that but I didn't understand it. I barely know anything about jQuery.
[11:58:44] <l3ck> W3Geek: got it. yeah I think you pass instead of assign because of what danzik17 said and to maintain the abstraction on events that jQuery gives you
[11:59:34] <W3Geek> That makes a bit more sense now.
[12:00:24] <gataraid> l3ck, do you mind helping me?
[12:00:48] <gataraid> l3ck, I got the animation to work on the logo but I'm wondering how can I get it to align properly
[12:01:01] <gataraid> the css has it centered with auto left and right margins
[12:01:12] <W3Geek> When I try document.getElementById("navID").onmouseover(function () { audio.play(); }); it doesn't work.
[12:01:13] <gataraid> but when I animate the Logo, it goes to the absolute left
[12:01:20] <l3ck> gataraid: are you trying to use animate with an 'auto' margin value?
[12:01:31] <gataraid> yes
[12:01:52] <gataraid> I'm learning jquery so don't be suprised if I say something that isn't relative.
[12:01:54] <Munger> When calling getJSON(), how do I handle the case when I know I will only receive a single response value? Clearly $.each( data, function( i,row ) is wrong
[12:02:20] <gataraid> for some reason it just aligns to the left without me asking it to
[12:02:22] <Munger> Still trying to wrap my head around jquery syntax
[12:02:40] <l3ck> gataraid: in my experience that doesn't work. you can calculate the exact position using width of the window and width of the element (all readable in jQuery) and animate to that
[12:03:18] <l3ck> gataraid: no worries, we'll get it sorted
[12:03:33] <gataraid> gataraid but for some reason it makes the animation come from the left into position
[12:03:40] <gataraid> I kinda wanted it to slide down from where it is
[12:03:52] <gataraid> slide from the position in the center, down to the position in center
[12:04:02] <koopa58> Hi, does anyone know a good multiple months calendar? I need one that allows me to define a range of days. I've tried jQuery Ui Datepicker, MultiDatesPicker and Eyecon's DatePicker.. all to no help yet :(
[12:04:03] <gataraid> because I set an absolute position on the logo to hide it
[12:04:38] <gataraid> I don't know why I typed my own name up there, that was kinda weird
[12:05:41] <brettster> not functioning yet - but what do you all think? http://brettfrable.com.s142783.gridserver.com/
[12:05:55] <gryg> hello, I have simple question. I have a list in html ex. <ul><li><a href="#" class="delete">dekete</a><p>some text</p></li></ul> and I need to set 2 onclick actions on li and a $('li').on('click', function(){ // do sth}) and $('li a'').on('click', function(){ // do sth}); the problem is that when I click on anchor li onclick function is lanuched. Any suggestions?
[12:06:36] <l3ck> gataraid: did you have a jsfiddle setup for this? sorry, I lost it in the scroll
[12:06:42] <gataraid> brettster pretty awesome if I say so myself
[12:06:55] <gataraid> l3ck, I can set one up right quick
[12:07:04] <brettster> thanks man
[12:07:06] <l3ck> gataraid: that'd be cool
[12:07:22] <gataraid> brettster, I honeslty don't see why you had to ask haha
[12:07:35] <brettster> just felt like showing off ;)
[12:13:15] <gataraid> http://jsfiddle.net/zXKXV/1/
[12:13:39] <gataraid> It's hard to see but this is aligned all the way to the left
[12:13:40] <alexr2> i can't tell if that's a question or a statement :-P
[12:14:00] <gataraid> I'm trying to get it to slide down the same way but in the center
[12:14:09] <gataraid> and it animate from the center down to the center
[12:14:43] <Sugitime> Anyone else have an issue qith jquery-1.7.js (min) and show()/hide()?
[12:14:45] <l3ck> gataraid: that's not a jQuery thing
[12:14:51] <alexr2> more of a css thing :-P
[12:14:56] <l3ck> margin doesn't work the same way with position:absolute
[12:14:59] <l3ck> its a css thing
[12:15:07] <Sugitime> I have jquery on the page, above my other code. but for whatever reason, I am getting show() is undefined in chrome and ff
[12:15:12] <gataraid> l3ck I gathered that too
[12:15:44] <gataraid> l3ck- I figured it was jquery because well, it's jquery that is overwriting the css but I assumed the absolute positioning threw the positioning off
[12:15:50] <gataraid> sorry, threw things off
[12:16:02] <l3ck> gataraid: fixed http://jsfiddle.net/PK8uA/
[12:16:22] <arun787987> Hi
[12:16:29] <gataraid> l3ck I don't see the differences
[12:16:30] <l3ck> took out your margin: 0 auto and added left: 50%; margin-left: -250px;
[12:16:35] <gataraid> ah
[12:16:52] <arun787987> I am testing jquery scrollTo plugin on my android
[12:16:57] <gataraid> http://jsfiddle.net/PK8uA/ shows the samething as I had
[12:17:05] <arun787987> But the horizonal scrolling doesnt work
[12:17:06] <gataraid> It still has the margin set to 0px auto
[12:17:06] <l3ck> gataraid: is it not centered?
[12:17:10] <l3ck> oh damn
[12:17:22] <gataraid> l3ck I think you forgot to save the changes as I had to do this twice myself
[12:17:22] <l3ck> http://jsfiddle.net/PK8uA/1/
[12:17:22] <gataraid> haha
[12:17:24] <westg> this would work too http://jsfiddle.net/zXKXV/1/
[12:17:26] <l3ck> haha
[12:17:28] <l3ck> how do you save?
[12:17:29] <arun787987> Test page here: http://arunrocks.com/t/
[12:17:31] <l3ck> the update button?
[12:17:34] <gataraid> haha yea
[12:17:49] <westg> http://jsfiddle.net/zXKXV/2/
[12:17:52] <westg> this ^
[12:17:54] <l3ck> ok that last link I sent should show the updates
[12:17:59] <gataraid> yours worked
[12:18:02] <gataraid> I think hold on sir
[12:18:48] <gataraid> http://www.bottomsound.com/ - yep
[12:18:50] <gataraid> that did it haha
[12:18:54] <gataraid> You're awesome man!
[12:19:10] <gataraid> Now let me study the CSS changes, so I can learn from this
[12:19:25] <westg> tbh there are a few ways to center things
[12:19:36] <l3ck> cool
[12:19:42] <westg> the best thing you can do is wrap your whole body element in a div
[12:19:50] <westg> and then have a width for that
[12:19:52] <l3ck> westg: wat?
[12:20:14] <westg> I really wish I knew what the best way to center stuff was
[12:20:35] <westg> l3ck: how do you center your stuff?
[12:20:38] <l3ck> westg: sudo rm -rf /* is the best
[12:20:41] <l3ck> haha
[12:20:41] <l3ck> nm
[12:20:50] <l3ck> westg: it all depends
[12:21:08] <l3ck> if it's in the page flow then margin: 0 auto; works great
[12:21:18] <gataraid> correct
[12:21:21] <l3ck> if you have a fixed width
[12:21:31] <westg> I read about negative margins but I'm kind of skeptical still
[12:21:40] <l3ck> westg: don't be. they're crucial
[12:22:03] <l3ck> you can create containers and then pull elements out of the containers using negative margins so they still remain within the page flow
[12:22:20] <l3ck> no need to fuck around with position: absolute and padding to cover it (or other crazy things)
[12:22:39] <westg> i know right
[12:22:58] <westg> i hate position absolute with a passion unless I'm in a relative div or something
[12:23:11] <westg> even then negative margins seem like the right way to go
[12:23:19] <l3ck> everything has its place
[12:23:41] <Sugitime> So I have a td, and within the td I have a fieldset. If a checkbox is checked, I want display: true, otherwise display: false. I got the show/hide working, but it re-sizes the page every time you check/uncheck the box. Is there a way to make it so its more smooth?
[12:23:50] <Sugitime> If I put the fieldset in a div, would that help?
[12:24:18] <Sugitime> Hm no it doesnt
[12:24:24] <koopa58> Hi everyone, do you know a good multiple months date picker? I need one that allows me to define a range of days, so selecting a second day will define the range. I've tried jQuery Ui Datepicker, MultiDatesPicker and Eyecon's DatePicker.. all to no help yet :(
[12:25:20] <l3ck> Sugitime: the page jump is because you're removing/adding height/width to the containing DOM element, causing a resize and redraw
[12:26:24] <Sugitime> So what woudl be a better solution? visibility: hidden looks bad (just one big empty block)
[12:27:20] <koopa58> MultiDatesPicker looks the most promising, but it can only make a range of predefined length
[12:27:38] <l3ck> fix the height of the containing element would do it
[12:28:36] <koopa58> And Eyecon's DatePicker does not show the current day
[12:29:15] <koopa58> Are there any other date picker plugins that I should take a look at?
[12:29:45] <JCBK> i've got a script which works fine when I dump it into the console, but it doesn't work on the page…I feel like this is a brainfart of some sort
[12:29:46] <l3ck> koopa58: sorry, dunno of any :/
[12:30:35] <JCBK> can someone take a look and see what i'm missing? http://56re.localtunnel.com
[12:30:57] <JCBK> it's this script: $(document).ready(function(){
[12:30:57] <JCBK> $(".index_post").hover(
[12:30:57] <JCBK> 	function () {
[12:30:57] <JCBK>     $(this).children('span').addClass("hover");
[12:30:57] <JCBK> 	},
[12:30:58] <JCBK> 	function () {
[12:30:58] <JCBK>     $(this).children('span').removeClass("hover");
[12:30:59] <JCBK> 	}
[12:30:59] <JCBK> );
[12:31:00] <JCBK> });
[12:31:32] <koopa58> l3ck: ah okay, thank you for your comment :) maybe someone else I hope?
[12:32:50] <RavenHursT> hey...question.... I've always been curious.... I always just copy and past the following "wrapper" whenever I've written jQuery plugins in the past.. but I really don't get it.  (function($){})(jQuery);  What exactly is javascript doing when you encapsulate two objects in parantheses like that?
[12:34:01] <l3ck> JCBK: can you setup a jsfiddle? I don't see anything with a class index_post on the link you provided
[12:34:46] <xec> RavenHursT: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[12:35:03] <sm> hi all. I'm inserting table rows with ajax, which cause the table to grow wider than the container. How come the container doesn't also resize, and what's a good way to fix that ?
[12:35:08] <lukeshu> RavenHursT: It is calling the function defined in the first part with jQuery as a parameter
[12:35:23] <RavenHursT> AH!!!
[12:35:31] <JCBK> l3ck: will do. the class index_post is there btw. body > twothird > page_holder > posts > index_post
[12:35:32] <RavenHursT> THANK YOU!
[12:36:25] <RavenHursT> lukeshu: so in the exaample above.. $ == jQuery?
[12:36:30] <l3ck> JCBK: drrr sorry i missed that
[12:36:34] <lukeshu> RavenHursT: yes
[12:36:52] <RavenHursT> Roger that.... well .. that cleared that right up.. thatnks!
[12:37:22] <lukeshu> RavenHursT: you're welcome!
[12:37:25] <JCBK> jsfiddle works exactly as expected http://jsfiddle.net/yp34c/
[12:37:50] <Dan_M_M> Hi, if there a better way of doing this $(this).parent().parent().children().children().removeClass('selected');
[12:37:53] <JCBK> oh wait, I've got a hunch of what the problem might be
[12:38:27] <Dan_M_M> basically i have some links in a list and want to remove .selected on all
[12:38:55] <l3ck> JCBK: yeah that's a little weird... seems like it ought to work
[12:39:20] <JCBK> hurray, fixed it. the script was in the index file, but the classes it was applied to were being called dynamically from another html file. so I moved the script into that file and all is fine again.
[12:39:56] <l3ck> JCBK: cool, you can also use the .on() method to do a delegate style thing so it works with dynamic content
[12:40:02] <l3ck> just fyi
[12:40:09] <JCBK> could you elaborate on that?
[12:42:47] <l3ck> JCBK: http://jsfiddle.net/QSRe7/1/ will work with dynamicly loaded .index_post elements
[12:45:12] <l3ck> JCBK: like so http://jsfiddle.net/QSRe7/2/
[12:45:40] <thinkerbell> How can I get the text from a <textarea id="theid">, I tried $('#theid').html();, but it didn't work
[12:46:21] <NoiseEee> thinkerbell: textarea is a type of input, which has  a value.   .val()
[12:46:24] <JCBK> l3ck: whats the reason for the 2nd part?
[12:46:50] <l3ck> JCBK: the bit that inserts more .index_post divs?
[12:46:57] <JCBK> yup
[12:47:49] <thinkerbell> NoiseEee, yep, of course, dunno why I never tried that, I just assumed it doesn't work, cause textarea doesn't have a value="" option in html, the text goes between <textarea></textarea> instead, so I just assumed to use html()
[12:50:40] <l3ck> JCBK: just to show that it works on newly inserted content
[12:51:03] <JCBK> l3ck: ah fair enough :)
[12:52:39] <t4nkd> Hullo jquery -- what's the 'best' way to determine if an input field has text present, maybe to bind a keypress event to the input that checks it's value? Open to opinions
[12:55:32] <skylamer`> $("name of the field").val().length !== 0
[12:55:37] <xec> t4nkd: depends entirely on *when* you need to know
[12:56:09] <xec> on submit prehaps? or page load? or blur?
[12:57:00] <t4nkd> Pretty sure I want keyup, as a button should be disabled if there is no content in the input
[12:57:51] <xec> yeah, page load + key up in field should work
[12:58:09] <xec> knockoutjs is pretty good at that sort of thing btw
[12:58:21] <shoky> knockoutjs++
[12:58:34] <t4nkd> meh, that's overkill, but good to know
[12:59:46] <t4nkd> Also I haven't really decided which I like best, Ember/Knockout/Backbone/Spine/WTFotherframeworkisnext
[12:59:58] <t4nkd> Appreciate the help tho
[13:06:53] <wuwoot> sorry, newbie question:
[13:07:07] <wuwoot> how do I set the click event to a class instead of id?
[13:07:22] <xec> swap the # with a .
[13:07:47] <wuwoot> xec: didn't appear to work. maybe i messed up the first time, but i'll try again
[13:09:49] <wuwoot> xec: let's say I wanted to set that to an id="states" and class="nv", is this accomplished with ('#states .nv').click(function() ?
[13:10:12] <t4nkd> Hrm, alright, new question. How would I go about asserting that every form input has some value before enabling the submit button; cause it's sort've working, but only the first input: http://jsfiddle.net/V56Un/3/
[13:10:15] <xec> you know css selectors?
[13:10:25] <wuwoot> xec: yea
[13:10:35] <xec> wuwoot: if the id and class is on the same you do #states.nv
[13:10:48] <wuwoot> xec: okay, thanks!!!
[13:10:49] <xec> if you want to select either, do "#states, nv"
[13:10:59] <xec> with a dot
[13:11:00] <sphinxxx> how do you add :hover rules with .css?
[13:11:09] <wuwoot> xec: got it
[13:11:22] <xec> sphinxxx: ?
[13:11:46] <t4nkd> why not just bind a hover event on that element that changes the css?
[13:11:53] <sphinxxx> like $('li a:hover').css('color:red'); doesn't work
[13:12:02] <t4nkd> not sure you can do pseudo-selectors inline
[13:12:20] <sphinxxx> problem is i don't have access to the css
[13:12:25] <t4nkd> sphinxxx: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5293299
[13:12:28] <sphinxxx> in this particular case
[13:13:53] <xec> :hover is for css, you can do mouseover or something with js though
[13:16:02] <FrozenFire> What event would I bind to that is called when an element's bottom reaches the viewport bottom? (for ajax loading)
[13:18:23] <zoned> did jquery update the way it does parseJSON?  i swear, you used to be able to say... var json = $.parseJSON(data); and json would ALWAYS be an ARRAY of objects. now it only returns an array if there more than 1?
[13:19:25] <xec> what the
[13:19:42] <xec> zoned: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png
[13:19:43] <FrozenFire> zoned, $.getJSON()
[13:19:52] <xec> oh nevermind
[13:19:58] <Dan_M_M> can anyone help me with this if you click two links quickly it will show two pages instead of one http://jsfiddle.net/HLjKD/ thanks
[13:19:58] <xec> i thought like FrozenFire xD
[13:20:19] <xec> sorry, ignore me
[13:21:27] <dwarder> i'm thinking about modifying https://github.com/robmonie/jquery-week-calendar/wiki/ in a sense that i need it to be able to show time periods like from 8 to 2 (i.e. 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,0,1,2) , question is can i trigger such functionality with a param? has anyone already written such functionality?
[13:22:12] <zoned> FrozenFire, i'm using $.ajax and parsing the response... should be no difference. question is, why doesn't it return an array if there's just one object?
[13:23:09] <FrozenFire> zoned, It should. Perhaps your server-side script is outputting differently for multiple or single objects?
[13:34:29] <Munger> Do async ajax queries to the same backend complete in the order in which they were started?
[13:35:16] <gehsekky> do they each take the same amount of time to finish?
[13:35:26] <sekretskwerl> Munger: not necessarily. that's the idea of async code, is that it finishes when it finishes, but they don't block each other
[13:36:00] <gehsekky> if they each take the same amount of time, you could argue that they do complete in the order in which they were started
[13:36:36] <Munger> sekretskwerl, That's what I thought. I have one query which detrmines the number of records matching a pattern, which I use to set the virtual width of a scrolling view, and a second which populates the thw visible area
[13:37:08] <sekretskwerl> i would make those synchronous calls.
[13:37:40] <Munger> I all likelihood, the first query should be much faster than the second because it's simply returning a count()
[13:37:53] <Munger> But, yeah. I guees I'll make that one sync
[13:39:40] <sekretskwerl> the one can't display without the information from the first one, so the async isn't doing anything for you anyway
[13:39:49] <sekretskwerl> and all your other calls will work asynchronously around those
[13:40:23] <Munger> OK. Wasn't sure if jq was doing any internal queueing
[13:40:48] <danzik17> Munger: nah, don't use synch calls.  this will bite you later.  do it right from the start - if you need the results of one for the next call, see ?pipe
[13:41:04] <Munger> ?pipe
[13:41:10] <danzik17> freaking lazy bot.
[13:41:10] <danzik17> http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.jquery.com%2Fdeferred.pipe%2F&ei=3T2HT5vYJYz2ggfU4NjeBw&usg=AFQjCNEmnQcjtEq0EMgeyHaHStVkotZU2w&sig2=hXPB2rWPYhPYE7SHvRu4oQ
[13:41:21] <Advocated> Hi there, random question, any of you come across an awesome looking jquery dialog/login type screen? I've spent ages looking around for something cool, but keep seeing the same boring stuff :s
[13:41:29] <Munger> Hah. Thought that was a message for a channel bot :-)
[13:43:41] <sunbeam> I've got a subscribe form (only 1 input field for e-mail address). I would like to know how I can best submit this
[13:46:26] <xec> Munger: it is, but bot-t is offline =(
[13:47:24] <gemini> I've wrote a x-fade page function in jquery (->mootools) for joomla 2.5. it works by turning off the current page and fading in the new page. i need to correct the code to fade out the current page and fade in the new page. can anybody help me with this?
[13:52:10] <t4nkd> hey jquery, if I'm using 1.7.1 do I still need to include JSON-js and es5-shim ?
[13:52:34] <t4nkd> for browser compatibility
[13:53:06] <bartmax> how to do a hasnot in jquery ?
[13:53:08] <bartmax> ?hasnot
[13:53:14] <bartmax> ? hasnot
[13:53:25] <bartmax> ? has
[13:53:40] <alexr2> has not for what?
[13:53:44] <johnkpaul> what's a has not?
[13:53:53] <sirecote> not has
[13:53:55] <johnkpaul> .has(":not()")?
[13:54:05] <bartmax> $('.container').hasnot('input:checked')
[13:54:17] <bartmax> johnkpaul: nice
[13:54:34] <alexr2> lol ^
[13:54:43] <bartmax> doesn't work
[13:54:43] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[13:55:03] <bartmax> console.log('info',$('.checkout_location').has(':not(input[type="radio"]:checked)'));
[13:55:14] <alexr2> bartmax, he gave you that answer based on the input you gave... it wouldn't work
[13:55:15] <bartmax> problem is, there is input not checked
[13:55:17] <d[-_-]b> How can i access an array from inside a $.post call ? it seems undefined as soon as its inside
[13:55:52] <bartmax> i just want to get the container div if none of the input is checked
[13:56:41] <alexr2> if ($('.container input:checkbox:checked').length == 0) ......
[13:57:04] <bartmax> alexr2: it has some inputs checked and some not
[13:57:12] <bartmax> alexr2: so that wont work either
[13:57:21] <bartmax> alexr2: i want the exact opposite of has()
[13:58:50] <Munger> danzik17, What advantage does pipe give me over simply nesting another getJSON() call inside the handler for the first call?
[13:59:04] <alexr2> i'm confused...
[13:59:27] <alexr2> you want to do something if all inputs in a container are not checked, correct?
[13:59:32] <alexr2> or am i missing something?
[13:59:48] <bartmax> got it! console.log('info',$('.checkout_location').not(':has(input[type="radio"]:checked)'));
[13:59:50] <bartmax> not should be first
[14:00:04] <alexr2> okay then...
[14:00:14] <danzik17> Munger: re-usability of the code for the first call for one - perhaps you don't *always* want to call that second handler.  that would certainly work though, and it accomplishes essentially the same thing as pipe
[14:00:32] <danzik17> Munger: but pipe will also return a promise that resolves when the entire chain of things are done
[14:00:35] <bartmax> the opposite of has y not(:has.......... :)
[14:03:06] <Munger> danzik17, I'll give it some more thought. More than likely I won't always be making the first query. I'm trying to implement a sideways scrolling view that displays a selection of albums in a huge collection. Obviously I only want a few loaded either side of the visible area
[14:03:54] <sunbeam> $('a[href="#contactForm"]').click( function() { }
[14:03:56] <sunbeam> what does this mean?
[14:04:09] <sunbeam> contactForm is the id of a <form>
[14:04:28] <tw2113> select the <a> tag that has the target destination of #contactForm
[14:04:46] <tw2113> probably some in-page links somewhere and that's capturing a click event for it
[14:05:05] <alexr2> a lot of tabbing plugins use that format
[14:05:07] <sunbeam> there's no a tag in the form #contactForm
[14:05:14] <sunbeam> <a> tag
[14:05:23] <sunbeam> so that's kinda strange
[14:05:29] <alexr2> no it isn't
[14:05:33] <alexr2> that's not what that is trying to get
[14:05:38] <alexr2> it's trying to find an a tag
[14:05:38] <tw2113> it's probably somewhere else
[14:05:49] <alexr2> that has a property href pointing to #contactForm
[14:05:54] <sunbeam> i'm just trying out this tutorial
[14:05:54] <sunbeam> http://www.elated.com/articles/slick-ajax-contact-form-jquery-php/
[14:06:03] <sunbeam> ah ok
[14:06:03] <alexr2> as in... <a href="#blah">Link</a>
[14:06:36] <tw2113> <a href="#contactForm">~ Send us an email ~</a>
[14:06:45] <alexr2> yep
[14:07:37] <sunbeam> ahh ok
[14:07:57] <sunbeam> is this a good way to submit a form with ajax?
[14:08:04] <dwarder> i'm thinking about modifying https://github.com/robmonie/jquery-week-calendar/wiki/ in a sense that i need it to be able to show time periods like from 8 to 2 (i.e. 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,0,1,2) , question is can i trigger such functionality with a param? has anyone already written such functionality?
[14:08:38] <tw2113> sunbeam i think that line is just used to display the form
[14:08:56] <sunbeam> tw2113: ok
[14:09:05] <sunbeam> tw2113: so i can skip that part? (where it is explained in?)
[14:09:09] <sunbeam> i don't need fading etc
[14:09:15] <sunbeam> i just want to submit a form with jquery / ajax
[14:09:25] <tw2113> is the form displayed already?
[14:09:46] <sunbeam> the markup etc i already did yes
[14:09:47] <sunbeam> and css etc
[14:10:03] <sunbeam> http://www.jstiles.com/Blog/How-To-Submit-a-Form-with-jQuery-and-AJAX
[14:10:06] <sunbeam> is this ok to learn how to
[14:10:09] <tw2113> if you're going to have the form showing from the getgo, it'd probably be fine to skip that part
[14:10:56] <alexr2> sunbeam, i've found this a good plugin for ajax form submission http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[14:11:53] <sunbeam> alexr2: maybe good later i bookmark it but for now i like to make it possible without any jquery plugins
[14:17:35] <alexr2> that tutorial is the general way to do it though
[14:17:41] <alexr2> the one you showed
[14:29:21] <b-lew> can anyone help me with a fancybox issue? seems like no one knows much about it
[14:30:44] <granville> hey guys.  Is it possible to trigger a click event on a submit button with the trigger method?
[14:31:18] <alexr2> b-lew, you should read the title of the channel
[14:31:35] <alexr2> just bind a click event to the submit buggon granville
[14:32:08] <sunbeam> <form action="includes/processform.inc.php" id="subscribe_form" method="post" onsubmit="submitForm();">
[14:32:11] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this?
[14:32:54] <granville> I have a link that openes a dialog.  when the dialog opens, I need a part of it to pull something from the server via ajax.  I had put a button on the form, which I do have a click event bound to it.  but when I have the jquery code on the link attempt to trigger the button, it doesn't work.
[14:33:24] <johnkpaul> granville: how are you attemping to trigger the button
[14:33:36] <Munger> Is there any way to pass user data to an ajax call that will be returned to the handler?
[14:33:49] <b-lew> fancybox is built on jquery i didn't think it'd matter
[14:33:50] <alexr2> sunbeam it depends, what is happening that shouldn't be?
[14:33:54] <granville> $('#element).trigger('click')
[14:34:15] <alexr2> granvile, just do $('#element').click()
[14:34:33] <brijesh_> hi, i'm trying to figure out why I inconsistently get 'parseerrors' and 'Invalid JSON' when i run an ajax change function (dynamically populate multiple select boxes). Was wondering if someone can help me figure out where I'm going wrong?
[14:34:36] <sunbeam> alexr2: it doesn't do what i want
[14:34:44] <alexr2> b-lew, i meant just ask your question
[14:34:45] <sunbeam> alexr2: execute function submitForm()
[14:34:57] <alexr2> what is it doing?
[14:35:09] <b-lew> alexr2  $('.image-grid_' + (i+1) ).fGallery('.filter_' + (i+1) );  -> this script is butting heads with fancybox.
[14:35:10] <sunbeam> alexr2: submiting the form and going to the php file
[14:35:11] <granville> click() is not working either
[14:35:21] <b-lew> duplicating the galleries
[14:35:26] <granville> does it matter if it's a submit button or a regular button?
[14:35:40] <sunbeam> granville: doesn't
[14:35:47] <b-lew> is there a way to make that line of code more specific so that it dosn't conflint
[14:35:53] <johnkpaul> granville: that depends on what handler you want to cal
[14:36:01] <johnkpaul> was this handler originally added using jquery
[14:36:02] <johnkpaul> granville: ?
[14:36:04] <alexr2> granville, select the form $(form).submit() instead
[14:36:32] <granville> the ajax call is on the button though, not on submit.
[14:36:37] <alexr2> sunbeam, try putting a return false in your submitForm() function
[14:37:06] <sunbeam> alexr2: i did
[14:37:12] <sunbeam> alexr2: but anyways .click() works fine
[14:37:25] <alexr2> oh that .click was meant for granville
[14:37:29] <alexr2> but it works for you as well i suppose
[14:37:30] <sunbeam> alexr2: is this just better to use? (in an extended .js script with all the custom jq things i do in it)
[14:37:42] <alexr2> i always use .click for that stuff
[14:37:53] <alexr2> and a <button> rather than an <input  submit
[14:38:09] <sunbeam> alexr2: ok, why if i may ask? semantically more accurate?
[14:38:13] <granville> thanks for the help.  I'm pretty sure it's because I'm using drupal's jquery version.  I bet they have something in the event binding that is preventing me from triggering the event.
[14:38:19] <brijesh_> is there anything wrong with this syntax that on some browsers I get a 'parseerror' and 'invalid JSON': $.ajax({ type: "POST", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", data: post_string_hosp, dataType: "json", cache: false,  url: hosp_url_string, timeout: 20000, error: function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) {alert(xhr.statusText); alert(thrownError); },
[14:38:31] <natte|wrk> yup
[14:38:32] <natte|wrk> trailing comma
[14:38:35] <alexr2> you should avoid putting javascript inline whenever possible
[14:38:40] <granville> I'll try their channel
[14:38:43] <alexr2> ie: the .click() is the way to go
[14:38:52] <alexr2> could be granville
[14:38:53] <alexr2> good luck
[14:38:54] <brijesh_> sorry, it's followed by a , success:, but i left that out
[14:39:10] <brijesh_> since the success is somewhat lengthy
[14:40:01] <alexr2> brijesh, is that an error you get on the callback or as you send the data to php
[14:40:09] <alexr2> or wherever you're sending it
[14:40:58] <brijesh_> my guess is on the callback; is there a clear way to figure out where the error is occurring?
[14:41:00] <Munger> Trying to pass a context into getJSON but it's throwing an exception
[14:41:07] <sunbeam> alexr2: ok thanks
[14:42:39] <brijesh_> alexr2: alexr2: i tested the encoded json on jsonlint and it's validating, so i'm not sure where the issue may lie
[14:45:19] <alexr2> brijesh_, are you using php on the backend?
[14:45:26] <brijesh_> yes i am
[14:45:53] <alexr2> is the only thing you're printing out json_encode()
[14:46:01] <brijesh_> yes
[14:46:13] <alexr2> take out the content type and try without it
[14:46:39] <Advocated> anyone know of any nice looking jquery dialog/modal forms?
[14:47:02] <brijesh_>  alexr2, ok thanks- let me give that a shot
[14:48:14] <brijesh_> alexr2, unfortunately, still getting the same parseerror and Invalid JSON: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> 	<head>...
[14:48:40] <alexr2> using zend?
[14:48:45] <brijesh_> codeigniter
[14:48:51] <alexr2> disable layouts
[14:49:08] <alexr2> for your ajax response
[14:49:27] <brijesh_> ok, let me try that
[14:49:45] <alexr2> well... what does it say in that response
[14:49:49] <alexr2> is it an error?
[14:49:55] <alexr2> or is it your response with the layout around it?
[14:50:17] <alexr2> either way you should disable layouts for it
[14:51:24] <brijesh_> it's an error
[14:51:39] <brijesh_> that makes sense, alexr2...let me do that and see if it works
[14:51:49] <alexr2> you'll have to fix the error as well :-P
[14:52:08] <brijesh_> i was thinking the parseerror is because the of the layout, no?
[14:52:24] <alexr2> yes
[14:52:33] <alexr2> but you're also getting a regular error in your php
[14:52:37] <alexr2> you'll have to fix both
[15:02:21] <someprimetime> what's a better way to do this so that I don't have to keep maintaining a bunch of if /else conditionals http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/KT7A2/32/
[15:02:48] <someprimetime> basically when you scroll to each of the images, the menu on the left should also scroll to that brand
[15:03:36] <brijesh_> alexr2, i disabled layouts, and it's now consistently working!
[15:04:04] <alexr2> awesome
[15:04:26] <brijesh_> alexr2- thank you so much, can I buy you a beer on buddybeer?
[15:06:36] <alexr2> haha no worries dude
[15:29:06] <naeluh> hey I am having some trouble with links on the nivoslider has any come across something like this?
[15:29:35] <DanYWalker> hi guys, i have a problem, i'm loading a div with ajax, and in this div i try load a google Map, but not appear nothing .. excuseme for mi inglish
[15:29:59] <naeluh> it works its just the links arent live http://nivo.dev7studios.com/support/jquery-plugin-usage/
[15:50:07] <felipe_Brz> any reason why this http://pastie.org/3777060 shouldn't work?? i'm just trying to see the checked values of each checkbox ... but my browser is giving off and error: Uncaught TypeError: Object 0 has no method 'prop'
[16:05:33] <orentanay> How would I watch an element for a change in class assignment, also, I was thinking that using .on aproach makes the most sense b/c the elements I'll be watching may not exist on the page yet, and when their class assignments change, it will be from a 3rd party script effecting them, not my own script. thanks.
[16:10:17] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Crossing T's and dotting i's to get ready for jQuery Mobile 1.1.0 FINAL tomorrow, bright and early. ★ http://bit.ly/HEApEZ
[16:10:17] <chovy> orentanay: you want something like onclasschange?
[16:12:22] <orentanay> chovy, yes, that soiunds right.
[16:17:22] <chovy> orentanay: not sure how i would go about doing that.
[16:17:32] <chovy> short of a setInterval
[16:18:44] <chovy> what can't you just trigger a function when you add the class?
[16:19:14] <Afflicto> Hey all, I have a problem where my script stops and chrome says "Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation" in the console. It occurs at the $.post() at line 70. Here: Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation
[16:20:55] <orentanay> chovy: I'm not the one triggering the addition or subtraction of the class, that is being handles by a 3rd party script that is part of the site.

[16:37:14] <Validatorian> I'm working on a browser extension, which is watching a page -- I need to send some data to the extension, but $(document).bind doesn't fire for the extension because it's a different instance of jQuery than the one hosted on the page it's viewing. I've tried using livequery plugin as well, and that has the same problem. Anyone know how I could trigger an event or talk to the other instance of
[16:37:15] <Validatorian> jquery somehow?
[16:47:18] <lenswipe> hey guys
[16:48:07] <lenswipe> like a number keypad, in the place of the normal one
[16:51:23] <helpmoi> hello, is anyone around. i need a bit of help...
[16:52:06] <helpmoi> http://jsfiddle.net/USxnd/
[16:54:58] <shoky> helpmoi whatcha need?
[17:01:30] <rpaddock> How can you add an attribute to an event object and have that new attribute propagate up with the event?
[17:01:45] <LordThumper> helpmoi

[17:12:34] <helpmoi> thx lord.. :)
[17:21:04] <majnun> can anyone help me with the selector here? I'm using $("#formsubmit").click(function() { and trying to do $('input[type=submit]', this).attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[17:21:20] <majnun> but of course it doesn't work, i guess because #formsubmit is the submit button and not the form
[17:26:42] <shoky> then why use 'this' ?
[17:26:47] <someprimetime> try $('input[type="submit"]', $(this)
[17:26:55] <majnun> also doesn't work someprimetime
[17:27:01] <someprimetime> is this a plugin?
[17:27:04] <shoky> you answered yourself..
[17:27:05] <majnun> no
[17:27:22] <majnun> shoky, selecting it directly isn't disabling it for some reason
[17:27:34] <someprimetime> $(this).find('input[type=submit]').attr('disabled', true);
[17:27:35] <majnun> so i thought maybe it's a problem with .clock and doing it this way
[17:27:57] <someprimetime> assuming that $('#formsubmit') is wrapping the entire <form>
[17:27:57] <shoky> selecting it directly how ?
[17:28:06] <shoky> someprimetime as he said, it's not
[17:28:26] <someprimetime> oh that's the submit button?
[17:28:32] <majnun> $("#buttonid").attr
[17:28:32] <shoky> yuh
[17:28:37] <majnun> like that
[17:28:46] <someprimetime> $('#formsubmit').click(function() { $(this).attr('disabled', true); });
[17:28:49] <someprimetime> how does that not work?
[17:28:56] <majnun> no idea
[17:29:03] <shoky> oh the clicked button is the one to be disabled?
[17:29:30] <westdb> hi, I'm trying to modify a tutorial I found. Can someone help me understand how it works?
[17:29:36] <majnun> yeah, i'm trying to disable it when i submit the form
[17:29:41] <majnun> since it's submitting to an iframe
[17:29:52] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/g5XfN/
[17:29:55] <someprimetime> should work
[17:30:16] <shoky> westdb don't ask to ask
[17:30:36] <someprimetime> majnun: not sure what you mean
[17:30:43] <majnun> weird, now it's really screwed up
[17:30:44] <majnun> sigh
[17:30:49] <shoky> majnun how bout you make a live demo on jsfiddle.com
[17:30:49] <westdb> shoky: will you look at this http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/06/28/awesome-cufonized-fly-out-menu/
[17:31:02] <someprimetime> what behavior are you expecting @majnun
[17:31:27] <majnun> https://gist.github.com/79701f685d7a00b25912
[17:31:28] <someprimetime> westdb: no one is going to read a tutorial to help you understand it.. start playing with it on jsfiddle, break it, then come here and ask questions
[17:31:29] <westdb> shoky: it uses cufon for the font, and has this animation on rollover where it slides in an element
[17:31:40] <shoky> westdb i'm trying their demo, very buggy :S
[17:31:44] <catcher> How can I tell if an object has a certain property?
[17:31:52] <catcher> if a property exists on a certain object, put another way
[17:32:04] <someprimetime> if (obj.property === 'undefined') {}
[17:32:06] <Afflicto> How can I do zipArchive->ectractTo(parent directory); ? doing ('../') ?
[17:32:16] <someprimetime> @catcher ^
[17:32:42] <catcher> someprimetime, ty
[17:32:52] <Afflicto> Wrong channel sorry lol :P
[17:33:01] <westdb> someprimetime: I have more specific questions. I think you can help. If you want to see what it does by looking at the original site, that's optional. I'll check out jsfiddle. I already modified it and broke it, and want to make the code original
[17:33:04] <shoky> someprimetime i think you forgot tyepof
[17:33:06] <shoky> typeof
[17:33:08] <someprimetime> yeah shoky
[17:33:09] <someprimetime> woops
[17:33:21] <someprimetime> if (typeof(obj.property) === 'undefined')
[17:33:26] <someprimetime> nice catch
[17:33:42] <someprimetime> @westdb then post the jsfiddle with your question in here
[17:33:47] <someprimetime> it's way easier to debug than a tutorial
[17:34:08] <westdb> @someprimetime: jsfiddle is awesome. thanks so much
[17:34:32] <someprimetime> sure np
[17:34:44] <catcher> Ah, there it is, thanks shoky
[17:34:56] <shoky> ;p
[17:35:13] <lenswipe> hey guys
[17:35:16] <lenswipe> anyone around?
[17:35:26] <shoky> seriously?
[17:37:56] <lenswipe> so yeah shoky
[17:38:08] <lenswipe> im using .on() but i think i might be using it wrong
[17:38:16] <shoky> do share
[17:39:01] <lenswipe> shoky, http://pastebin.com/CnY1RWyD
[17:39:55] <shoky> snippet looks fine
[17:40:05] <shoky> doesn't mean you're using it right ;p
[17:40:17] <shoky> er
[17:40:29] <shoky> no, the events go first
[17:40:45] <shoky> if you think you're using it wrong, have a look at the docs...
[17:41:03] <RubbishBin> hi
[17:41:07] <shoky> helo
[17:41:26] <RubbishBin> i am trying to create a select list from jquery
[17:41:59] <RubbishBin> is there a way to add multiple options to that list from jquery?
[17:42:29] <shoky> sure
[17:43:17] <shoky> selectBox.append('<option value="foo">foo</option>').append('<option value="bar">bar</option>')
[17:45:48] <lenswipe> shoky, the events go first?
[17:46:09] <shoky> docs lenswipe, docs
[17:46:15] <lenswipe> RubbishBin, i assume you're using ajax?
[17:46:35] <RubbishBin> no, not using ajax
[17:46:40] <lenswipe> mkay
[17:46:44] <RubbishBin> dont really know how to use it
[17:46:55] <RubbishBin> still learning this whole jquery business:)
[17:50:17] <lenswipe> RubbishBin, it took me a couple of weeks, thats all
[17:50:21] <lenswipe> its pretty simple when you get into it
[17:50:28] <lenswipe> but i still have to come in here and ask for help now and then
[17:50:49] <lenswipe> $('RubbishBin').empty();
[17:50:55] <lenswipe> *rimshot*
[17:51:11] <RubbishBin> lol
[17:51:19] <RubbishBin> i feel hollow now
[17:53:50] <lenswipe> :)
[17:56:22] <westdb> @someprimetime: jsfiddle isn't doing it. The results panel doesn't work :(

[17:56:50] <shoky> ew
[17:57:34] <westdb> helpmoi: what do you want it to do?
[17:58:53] <shoky> sure it's working
[17:59:09] <shoky> westdb that's not how to fiddle
[17:59:26] <shoky> need to seperate html/css/javascript
[17:59:34] <shoky> and external resources
[17:59:40] <RubbishBin> ok got it to work
[17:59:56] <RubbishBin> how can i change an attribute on something depending on what has been selected in the selection box
[18:00:14] <shoky> .val() to get the value of the selectbox
[18:03:49] <westdb> @shoky: so I take out all <script> references? I'm not exactly sure how to fiddle
[18:04:29] <westdb> @shoky: wait I'm getting it
[18:05:14] <shoky> put script references in 'Add Resources'
[18:07:15] <RubbishBin> put my code up here: http://typewith.me/p/asdf
[18:07:54] <RubbishBin> how come that doesnt work?
[18:08:40] <shoky> RubbishBin, jsfiddle it
[18:12:30] <helpmoi> http://jsfiddle.net/USxnd/6/ <, i wanted to do some legacy coding.. which get the buttons is, type, etc. from a onlick="function()"
[18:12:52] <helpmoi> i mean get the button's type,id,etc..
[18:17:32] <RubbishBin> sweet, got it
[18:17:41] <westdb> ok, here's my fiddle so far
[18:17:44] <westdb> http://jsfiddle.net/dbwest/LHb8r/
[18:17:53] <RubbishBin> me being an idiot, was trying to set the attr of the wrong thing duhhh
[18:20:26] <westdb> can I quickly maximize a fiddle window(i.e. the js window)
[18:24:23] <shoky> westdb, so whatcha need?
[18:24:33] <shoky> still not a proper fiddle btw
[18:24:51] <westdb> ok, here's the broken version, with my additions: http://jsfiddle.net/dbwest/VxWfJ/1/
[18:25:24] <westdb> and please tell me how to fiddle properly. Is it an RTFM thing?
[18:26:00] <shoky> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/VxWfJ/2/
[18:26:18] <shoky> or this for the non-broken one: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/LHb8r/1/
[18:26:32] <westdb> @shoky: you saw the animations on http://jsfiddle.net/dbwest/LHb8r/ right? How can I make it proper?
[18:26:41] <westdb> ok
[18:27:01] <shoky> well, what's the difference between then
[18:27:02] <shoky> them
[18:27:07] <shoky> ?
[18:28:11] <westdb> shoky: got it. I saw that in the documentation, but I couldn't believe it would work without the body tags html tags, etc
[18:28:19] <westdb> ok
[18:28:57] <westdb> the non-broken one has the nav on the right and one other major thing. The sliding descriptions for each nav element.
[18:30:45] <westdb> eventually, I want to work on the broken one and make it so that when I click a nav element, a queue happens. Something like ... a bigger blue area opens up for content. Then I move the description to the top
[18:32:16] <shoky> well you have this:  .bind('click',function(){
[18:32:19] <shoky> in a new line..
[18:32:25] <shoky> causing a javascript error
[18:32:31] <westdb> I'm trying to make the content area bigger like 350px by 650px
[18:32:42] <westdb> ok
[18:32:49] <westdb> I'll work on that
[18:33:33] <westdb> does jslint give that debug info?
[18:34:08] <shoky> i see it in chrome's console
[18:34:15] <westdb> oh looks like I need to move a semicolon
[18:34:28] <shoky> you need to close the previous handler
[18:34:35] <shoky> like this- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/VxWfJ/3/
[18:34:47] <shoky> now it works i guess
[18:35:21] <shoky> you can get a console by choosing 'jQuery (edge)' and then checking 'firebug lite'
[18:35:33] <westdb> great that's a step
[18:38:36] <westdb> so this is how you closed the handler? })
[18:39:16] <shoky> yup
[18:39:23] <shoky> } to close the anonymous function
[18:39:27] <shoky> ) to close the .bind(
[18:40:23] <westdb> ok. I'm going to look over this later. This is helpful. I'm going to look at a JS book I have, too.
[18:40:39] <shoky> sounds good
[18:40:44] <westdb> I'm still not quite sure I understand the mechanism behind this, though
[18:40:55] <shoky> which part
[18:41:41] <westdb> well the sliding blue thing is what I want to mess around with
[18:42:01] <shoky> nothing beats reading the code ;)
[18:42:08] <westdb> I want to make one that's just a different size and slides up just as a start
[18:42:28] <westdb> so, from the code, it looks like the blue thing is in the css as .slidingMenu li.move
[18:42:59] <westdb> it'shex color is blue, it has rounded corners, etc
[18:43:26] <westdb> so I copied it, but it's not appearing on the page
[18:44:38] <westdb> I'm sorry, the blue sliding element I replicated was .slidingMenuDesc div
[18:45:02] <shoky> works for me when i change .slidingMenuDesc div
[18:45:08] <westdb> I called my copy .slidingContentDesc div
[18:45:10] <shoky> changed the gradients color
[18:45:29] <westdb> so how can I get .slidingContentDesc div to show up?
[18:48:43] <westdb> can I see the fork where you changed the color?
[18:49:56] <shoky> sure.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/VxWfJ/4/
[18:50:22] <shoky> i guess you'd need to replace any occurence of .slidingMenuDesc with .slidingContentDesc
[18:50:26] <shoky> if i understand what you mean..
[18:52:16] <westdb> ok I did it. I forgot I'm using chrome and I was changing all the moz colors
[18:52:43] <shoky> change all of them whatever yer using ;p
[18:52:55] <westdb> oh, just checked out the fork with the gradient. that's cool
[18:56:11] <westdb> I want to, for instance mouse over "About Me." See "Short bio ..." zoom up. Click on "About me". Have a new sliding blue thing (.slidingContentDesc) come up. Have an animation queued after that that brings "Short bio..." to the top as a header, and then load in page content :)
[18:58:21] <westdb> it's a different kind of animation for the big box. instead of left to right it goes from the bottom to the top
[18:58:38] <shoky> step by step, then ;p
[19:02:31] <westdb> @shoky thanks for your help and goodnight :)

[19:14:31] <MysterOnyx> I globally defined an array in javascript, and then in a $.getJSON(), I populated the array. When I alert the array within the getJSON, it alerts correctly. When I try to alert immediately after the .getJSON, it tells me the array is undefined. Is there a good reason for this?
[19:15:17] <shoky> how did you globally define it
[19:15:33] <MysterOnyx> weight = [];
[19:15:47] <MysterOnyx> every one of my other arrays works fine within other functions and such
[19:16:01] <shoky> and then alert(weight) ?
[19:16:25] <MysterOnyx> alert(weight[array['id']][1]); <<< that works within the getJSON but not outside of it
[19:16:31] <shoky> why would it work outside of it?
[19:16:35] <shoky> the array is empty
[19:16:49] <MysterOnyx> I populate the array within getJSON
[19:16:54] <MysterOnyx> using data from a mysql
[19:16:56] <shoky> yes
[19:17:02] <shoky> so its asynchronous
[19:17:22] <MysterOnyx> I'm sorry I don't understand.
[19:17:27] <shoky> the array is only populated when the request gets a success response
[19:17:33] <shoky> that could take a while
[19:17:43] <MysterOnyx> I did get a success response
[19:17:50] <TheLolrus> Hi I have a function that scrolls to a certain element on a page, but before doing so it stutters abrubtly... How do I prevent that from happening? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/580535/
[19:17:51] <shoky> but the call doesn't block, it returns immediately (before the array is populated)
[19:18:04] <shoky> you didn't get it right after the getJSON call returned.
[19:18:10] <MysterOnyx> hmm
[19:18:16] <shoky> you got it only when.. you got it
[19:18:31] <MysterOnyx> all I'm trying to do is populate an array with mysql data... seems like $.getJSON isn't the best way to do it?
[19:18:53] <shoky> it's fine
[19:19:07] <fakedarren> if I wanted to do something like class from mootools with jquery any suggestions?
[19:19:15] <shoky> but you have to be aware that onnly when the request is successful then the array is populated, not before that
[19:19:23] <MysterOnyx> hmm
[19:19:46] <shoky> so put the code that needs to handle the array data, inside of the success callback for the getJSON
[19:19:54] <shoky> as you said you did and it worked.
[19:20:14] <MysterOnyx> ok
[19:20:20] <MysterOnyx> here is my code: http://pastebin.com/nrYCicRV
[19:20:28] <shoky> need i look at it?
[19:20:41] <MysterOnyx> I'm just curious if what I put there really is wrong
[19:20:50] <shoky> alert(weight[array['id']][1]); <<< that works within the getJSON but not outside of it
[19:21:00] <shoky> you already mentioned the wrong part
[19:21:10] <MysterOnyx> ok
[19:21:45] <shoky> you weren't alerting from "within getJSON"
[19:22:01] <shoky> you were alerting from within the success callback for the getJSON
[19:22:08] <MysterOnyx> in that code I pasted, no, it's outside
[19:22:11] <fakedarren> shoky: if I wanted to do something like class from mootools with jquery any suggestions?
[19:22:22] <shoky> yeah i was talking about the within part ;)
[19:22:30] <MysterOnyx> shoky ok, so I was correctly populating within the getJSON then?
[19:22:41] <MysterOnyx> within the success callback I mean
[19:22:43] <shoky> fakedarren when i wanted class based stuff i used Class.js
[19:22:57] <shoky> non-jquery related
[19:22:57] <fakedarren> ok cool thanks will take a look
[19:23:09] <shoky> john resig's
[19:23:12] <shoky> er
[19:23:29] <shoky> this one http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
[19:23:40] <fakedarren> oh
[19:23:43] <MysterOnyx> so if I was alerting within the getJSON success callback, I'm not sure why the array still isn't being populated
[19:23:49] <shoky> but i've never used mootools so i'm not sure what you want really
[19:24:01] <fakedarren> hmm ok
[19:24:03] <fakedarren> thanks
[19:24:10] <shoky> MysterOnyx you said that it alerted correctly from within
[19:24:11] <shoky> no?
[19:24:14] <MysterOnyx> yeah
[19:24:30] <MysterOnyx> which means that at some point, the array was populated
[19:24:44] <shoky> aren't you the one doing the populating?
[19:24:48] <MysterOnyx> but suddenly when getJSON is over, the array is depopulated
[19:24:57] <shoky> ill peep at your code
[19:25:01] <MysterOnyx> ok
[19:25:21] <shoky> yeah you're populating the array in the callback
[19:25:28] <shoky> so.. whats the prob?
[19:25:46] <MysterOnyx> that final alert at the bottom comes back as weight being undefined
[19:25:53] <shoky> as it should!
[19:26:00] <shoky> that gets called BEFORE the callback gets called
[19:26:10] <MysterOnyx> ok I understand now
[19:26:14] <shoky> yayz
[19:26:39] <MysterOnyx> the question then is how can I manipulated weight outside of the JSON if everything is getting called before it?
[19:26:44] <MysterOnyx> manipulate*
[19:27:07] <shoky> remember, the ajax requests are NON-blocking. meaning they return immediately, before the request gets a response
[19:27:19] <MysterOnyx> ok
[19:27:39] <shoky> the question is what you want to do
[19:27:45] <shoky> what do you want happening
[19:27:59] <shoky> do you want something to happen BEFORE the request is sent?
[19:28:09] <MysterOnyx> no
[19:28:17] <shoky> good
[19:28:40] <MysterOnyx> I'm just not sure how to make everything else hold until the response comes in
[19:28:42] <shoky> then only touch the data inside the callback, after the array is populated
[19:28:50] <shoky> what is everything else?
[19:28:59] <MysterOnyx> other functions that use the weight array
[19:29:31] <shoky> they should only be called after you know the array is populated..
[19:29:43] <shoky> what functions for example..?
[19:30:28] <MysterOnyx> there's a function that builds a table, and it needs values from weight
[19:30:33] <shoky> i guess getting into Deferreds could be useful for you, but I haven't much experience with them
[19:30:44] <MysterOnyx> I'm just surprised it's so hard to populate an array
[19:30:53] <shoky> it's not
[19:31:10] <shoky> array is populated fine
[19:31:30] <shoky> ok so there's a function that builds a table
[19:31:32] <shoky> when do you call it?
[19:31:47] <MysterOnyx> immediately after the getJSON
[19:31:59] <shoky> so move it inside the callback
[19:32:09] <shoky> after the array is populated.
[19:32:09] <MysterOnyx> the getJSON populates the array, and then a function is called to display the table, which then calls a few other functions that help with building the table
[19:32:33] <shoky> that's not a good description of what was happening
[19:32:36] <MysterOnyx> basically all of my code occurs after that array population
[19:32:50] <shoky> move that stuff inside the callback
[19:33:11] <TheLolrus> anyone? :/
[19:33:34] <MysterOnyx> the callback occurs within $(function(){ at the beginning of the script... I'm not sure if I want all of my code going inside of that. I guess I can try it though
[19:34:22] <shoky> it's up to you to refactor things into seperate functions if stuff is getting messy..
[19:35:27] <MysterOnyx> what's happening is I have jquery UI's autocomplete as a function. Once the autocomplete has been selected, the getJSON occurs
[19:35:51] <MysterOnyx> to populate the array with the properties of the item chosen
[19:36:13] <MysterOnyx> it's going to be re run every time I do another autocomplete
[19:37:29] <shoky> so? the array gets repopulated then
[19:37:40] <MysterOnyx> right
[19:37:56] <shoky> btw: http://pastebin.com/djniJ9C5
[19:38:45] <MysterOnyx> actually, thanks, that may be easier for me
[19:39:03] <MysterOnyx> I had several functions creating the tables, but I could just use the ajax function to do it all
[19:39:15] <shoky> the ajax function = the callback
[19:39:19] <shoky> ?
[19:39:22] <MysterOnyx> yea
[19:39:29] <shoky> yea so that's what i've been saying..
[19:39:33] <shoky> put stuff in the callback
[19:40:03] <MysterOnyx> yeah at first I didn't like the idea of putting all of my code within a function of a function, but seeing it the way you made it, with the ajax function separate from the .getJSON is ok with me
[19:40:16] <shoky> yuhp
[19:40:27] <MysterOnyx> thanks
[19:40:34] <shoky> you can always use a named function instead of an anonymous one
[19:40:36] <shoky> np
[19:48:39] <xiam> 8
[19:48:59] <shoky> 7
[19:49:23] <xiam> sorry, I meant /win 8. heh.
[20:01:37] <helpmoi> http://jsfiddle.net/USxnd/6/ < can some1 tell my event.target is not working?
[20:01:49] <phantomcircuit> i've got a datepicker which is inline (it's a div not an input)
[20:01:58] <justinhjohnson> helpmoi: e.target
[20:02:07] <phantomcircuit> clicking on another date doesn't change the selected date though
[20:03:09] <phantomcircuit> https://support.intersango.com/support/open_ticket
[20:03:15] <phantomcircuit> click "uk deposit inquiry"
[20:04:46] <helpmoi> only.. if e= this right?
[20:05:38] <iateadonut> i have an input text, and i would like to hit enter for it to submit; i was wondering how do i bind a function to a single input box when it is submitted like that?
[20:06:21] <justinhjohnson> helpmoi: change event.target to e.target…. or change e to event in function CallAjax(e,b)
[20:06:38] <Doppler> helpmoi: it works for me the way you have it, at least in chrome
[20:07:09] <phantomcircuit> nvm it's working
[20:07:12] <Doppler> but I get what justinhjohnson is saying, you wanted the event param to match what you're using in the function
[20:08:00] <helpmoi> well e,b e just some passed variable.
[20:08:11] <helpmoi> it doesnt work on all browsers though.
[20:08:12] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[20:08:30] <justinhjohnson> helpmoi: they're not 'just some passed variables' lol
[20:08:53] <Doppler> helpmoi: changing them like justinhjohnson suggested should make it work cross browser
[20:09:08] <justinhjohnson> helpmoi: e is the event object that has the target property you want. it's coming from the event listener on your input[type=button]
[20:09:47] <MysterOnyx> is it possible to simply make your webpage wait until json has completed its request / response?
[20:10:14] <iateadonut> iateadonut: you can only bind submit to a form
[20:10:42] <helpmoi> http://jsfiddle.net/USxnd/7/ < look at this. it says undefined.
[20:13:50] <Doppler> helpmoi: if you're passing in 'this', then use that as your param to pass into your function to read the attrs
[20:14:46] <Doppler> helpmoi: http://jsfiddle.net/USxnd/8/
[20:15:03] <Doppler> b = this, a reference to the input
[20:24:29] <justinhjohnson> helpmoi: http://jsfiddle.net/USxnd/10/
[20:25:08] <Doppler> justinhjohnson: nice move on eliminating the inline js
[20:25:26] <justinhjohnson> note that i changed the pref from 'no wrap' to onLoad, but it would be best to make it onDomReady
[20:25:40] <justinhjohnson> Doppler: i know my separation of concerns, at least ;)
[20:25:58] <Doppler> indeed
[20:30:05] <justinhjohnson> helpmoi: did that jsfiddle make sense?
[20:30:09] <shoky> MysterOnyx you want your webpage to freeze (be unresponsive) while the ajax request is going on? ;p
[20:31:15] <MysterOnyx> shoky eh, I've run into an issue because this json gets called so many times, I'm having trouble putting all of my code within the callback
[20:31:33] <shoky> some rethinking is probably in order
[20:32:04] <nook> can you have jquery and prototype on the same page?
[20:32:05] <gnarf> MysterOnyx: step one
[20:32:10] <gnarf> MysterOnyx: give your callback a name
[20:32:32] <b-lew> can anyone help me with a fancybox issue i'm having that is duplicating my galleries?
[20:32:54] <gnarf> MysterOnyx: step two.... https://gist.github.com/0d8187787242d5646d64
[20:33:30] <MysterOnyx> shoky gave me that idea earlier
[20:33:33] <shoky> aye that's what i meant by getting into deferreds before, MysterOnyx
[20:33:33] <gnarf> MysterOnyx: step three - find the "other case
[20:33:50] <shoky> i haven't used them much so wasn't aware of how simple it is to use them
[20:33:54] <gnarf> MysterOnyx: and then have .done( handleThis ).done( handleThat )
[20:33:55] <MysterOnyx> hmm
[20:34:25] <MysterOnyx> can you do $.getJSON().done the same way as $.ajax().done?
[20:34:38] <shoky> prolly
[20:36:00] <justinhjohnson> MysterOnyx: you could also trigger an event within the callback and listen for it elsewhere. gives you some additional flexibility if you want multiple methods to be called when a single event occurs, without any of the methods knowing about each other
[20:36:25] <MysterOnyx> true, justinhjohnson
[20:36:28] <shoky> ^^ great advice
[20:36:37] <gnarf> MysterOnyx: then you start thinking.... https://gist.github.com/50e7f35da5925046f7bf
[20:37:12] <gnarf> er sry
[20:37:21] <gnarf> fixed
[20:37:27] <gnarf> line 13 modified
[20:37:30] <MysterOnyx> I'll chew on that gnarf. I'm new to this ajax stuff, so I've gotta wrap my head around it
[20:37:41] <gnarf> ?101
[20:37:41] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[20:37:43] <gnarf> ?learn

[20:37:53] <justinhjohnson> MysterOnyx: an example https://gist.github.com/2373450
[20:38:02] <gnarf> justinhjohnson++
[20:38:30] <MysterOnyx> very nice justinhjohnson, thanks
[20:39:00] <justinhjohnson> sure thing
[20:41:15] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[20:41:15] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[20:41:18] <shoky> gnarf, one thing i don't understand about your paste.. when is the 'cached' argument ever set?
[20:41:28] <gnarf> ♥
[20:41:36] <gnarf> shoky: did you refresh?
[20:41:40] <justinhjohnson> bot-t++
[20:41:42] <gnarf> shoky: i had to modify line 13
[20:41:43] <justinhjohnson> lol
[20:41:47] <shoky> yeah
[20:41:53] <gnarf> shoky: line 13 is the set
[20:41:56] <justinhjohnson> oh IRC, i'll never understand you
[20:42:14] <shoky> hm I don't understand
[20:42:32] <shoky> it's setting getTheJSON.cache
[20:42:38] <gnarf> ?js function a() { return a.b = 123; } console.log( a(), a.b );
[20:42:42] <bot-t> gnarf: 123 123
[20:43:07] <gnarf> getTheJSON is a function, which is an object, and I'm setting the "cache" property equal to the jqXHR
[20:43:33] <shoky> yes i understand that
[20:43:39] <helpmoi> justinhjohnson : i cant do that.. this is a legacy code. i cant change anything aside fromthe js
[20:43:48] <gnarf> then two succesive calls to getTheJSON from anywhere in the app can retrieve (and attach done) the same jqXHR on the second call, or request a new one
[20:44:14] <gnarf> or rather invert argument name
[20:44:16] <gnarf> you're right
[20:44:30] <gnarf> updated
[20:44:39] <gnarf> its now getTheJSON( data, refreshed )
[20:44:51] <nook> how come 1 works but two doesn't? 1 http://jsfiddle.net/sZNNZ/1/ 2 http://jsfiddle.net/A3B5P/5/
[20:44:55] <gnarf> or even drop ( data )
[20:44:59] <gnarf> whatever
[20:45:03] <gnarf> abstractions
[20:46:10] <shoky> should be if ( !refresh && getTheJSON.cache )  ,  no?
[20:46:26] <gnarf> sure
[20:46:31] <gnarf> fix it yourself
[20:46:32] <gnarf> ;)
[20:46:36] <gnarf> i aircoded it man
[20:46:41] <shoky> just wanna make sure i get it man ;)
[20:46:48] <gnarf> good work debugging it
[20:46:56] <gnarf> if you really wanna make sure you got it, write a unit test for it
[20:46:57] <gnarf> ;)
[20:47:08] <gnarf> and/or from it
[20:47:28] <gnarf> console.log( getTheJSON() === getTheJSON() )
[20:47:39] <b-lew> anyone around? can i get some help with a complecated issue i'm having?
[20:47:41] <shoky> ;)
[20:47:45] <gnarf> console.log( getTheJSON() !== getTheJSON( true ) )
[20:48:02] <shoky> thanks for your patience gnarf :)
[20:48:16] <shoky> (and your work, duh)
[20:48:56] <justinhjohnson> helpmoi: how about something like http://jsfiddle.net/USxnd/13/
[20:49:35] <gnarf> shoky: I actually have an API object in my app i'm working on that returns different permutaions of api calls by like
[20:49:42] <gnarf> API.getUser({ id: 10 })
[20:50:21] <gnarf> API.getUser({ id: 10 }).done( function( user ) { console.log( user.profile ); });
[20:51:22] <helpmoi>  <justinhjohnson>  works on chrome.. but somehow in ff.. it doesnt :((
[20:52:48] <shoky> not sure i get what yer sayin there gnarf ;)
[20:53:31] <gnarf> shoky: most of my app deals with ajax calls
[20:53:44] <gnarf> most interfaces need their data from those objects
[20:54:04] <gnarf> the "user" returned is actually created from an API.User( jsonResponse )
[20:54:20] <gnarf> and has functions / templates
[20:54:33] <gnarf> or at least the branch sitting in my head
[20:54:34] <gnarf> ;)
[20:54:47] <gnarf> its a pretty api
[20:55:14] <shoky> sounds pretty
[20:55:27] <gnarf> its not that hard to do
[20:55:31] <gnarf> ?deferred.pipe
[20:55:31] <bot-t> deferred.pipe([doneFilter], [failFilter]): [New in v1.6] Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[20:56:01] <gnarf> $.ajax().pipe( function( response ) { return new API.User( response ); })
[20:56:37] <gnarf> and you could maybe even "user.getFriends({ online: true }).done( populateBuddies );" in the response
[20:57:23] <shoky> sweet
[20:57:36] <shoky> what's the app
[20:57:58] <gnarf> *shrug* its the API sitting in my head
[20:58:15] <gnarf> can't really talk about the app itself right now anyway, nor is it very "sexy"
[20:58:17] <gnarf> ask chee ;)
[20:58:29] <shoky> chee dear
[21:21:49] <totimkopf>  I want to be able to make a function based on data from ajax. Obviously this won't work but this will give you an idea of what I am trying to achieve: http://pastebin.com/STnQdgXk
[21:22:08] <totimkopf> I understand that I can't return values asynchronously, so I wonder how to achieve this
[21:23:02] <shoky> heh
[21:23:13] <shoky> <gnarf> MysterOnyx: step one
[21:23:17] <shoky> <gnarf> MysterOnyx: give your callback a name
[21:23:22] <shoky>  <gnarf> MysterOnyx: step two.... https://gist.github.com/0d8187787242d5646d64
[21:23:27] <shoky> <gnarf> MysterOnyx: step three - find the "other case
[21:23:35] <shoky> <gnarf> MysterOnyx: and then have .done( handleThis ).done( handleThat )
[21:24:44] <iateadonut> how do i get the first class of $('#addSubServiceInput'). ?
[21:24:45] <b-lew> can i score some help on a complicated issue i'm having
[21:24:45] <beancurd> in jquery mobile i want to target 'data-role="blahblah"' how would i go about doing it?
[21:24:45] <shoky> iateadonut what do you mean the first class?
[21:24:45] <shoky> beancurd i dunno mobile, but.. .attr('data-role') ?
[21:24:57] <shoky> or maybe those might even work with .data() dunno
[21:25:11] <beancurd> hmm.. will try.
[21:27:07] <iateadonut> maybe class="class1 class2"
[21:28:07] <totimkopf> hehe
[21:28:11] <totimkopf> nice nick iaj_
[21:28:14] <totimkopf> iateadonut,
[21:28:59] <justinhjohnson> iateadonut: http://jsfiddle.net/Hthqx/
[21:29:05] <justinhjohnson> $('#addSubServiceInput').get(0).className.split(' ')[0]
[21:29:22] <shoky> heh
[21:29:24] <justinhjohnson> that's a one liner but very error prone
[21:30:03] <someprimetime> how do you use $.each() without starting at a base index of 0?
[21:30:39] <shoky> you can slice the array
[21:31:07] <someprimetime> it's an object
[21:31:17] <someprimetime> must i convert it into an array?
[21:31:19] <justinhjohnson> shoky: yeah, good point
[21:31:47] <shoky> if it's not an array what do you mean by index 0?
[21:31:57] <shoky> justinhjohnson, what, the slicing?
[21:32:03] <totimkopf> one solution I can think of is to just return json data based on multiple server side checks.... then check the json data synchronously
[21:32:16] <totimkopf> but I was hoping for a more elegant solution :D
[21:32:23] <iateadonut> justinhjohnson, thanks.
[21:32:34] <crowemi> coldhead, you're on every night huh?
[21:32:41] <justinhjohnson> shoky: yeah the slice reco

[21:36:37] <serdem> hey.google plus  doesn't use ajax for the whole page i think, but it works lik it is ajax. when you click a link "loading" label shows up at the top and the most importat part is the address is not ajax...

[21:38:09] <coldhead> crowemi: every working day, my time
[21:38:17] <coldhead> the night is coldhead time

[21:38:22] <coldhead> you don't go there
[21:38:26] <shoky> wow that was scary
[21:38:31] <crowemi> Lol, nice
[21:38:52] <shoky> serdem sry i never logged into google plus
[21:39:33] <shoky> but if it looks like it works like ajax, why do you think it doesn't
[21:40:18] <serdem> shoky, because, the address changes.
[21:40:32] <serdem> shoky, not in ajax way (#)
[21:40:45] <shoky> these days javascript can easily change the address

[22:20:42] <infid> jgithub
[22:47:29] <infid> anyone know why this isn't alerting when I right-click in my textarea: $("myTextarea").on('contextmenu', function() { alert('works'); } );
[22:48:06] <infid> assuming i had closed those braces right, which I did in my actual app.. there's no syntax errors, it just fails to catch the right-click
[22:48:29] <faryshta> infid, can we see the code?
[22:48:36] <d[-_-]b> Hey guys, is the solution I'm looking for referred to as Closures? -> I have an array that is going out of scope(Fine prior to the $.post call), it seems to loose scope in the callback function
[22:49:04] <infid> faryshta: unfortunately no. It's copy protected code. And that code works for me in isolation, just not with our app and I can't figure out why
[22:49:16] <faryshta> infid, sorry we can't help.
[22:49:31] <infid> faryshta: can't throw any ballpark ideas as to what could cause that to fail?
[22:49:59] <Cork> d[-_-]b: might be, yes
[22:50:09] <infid> faryshta: what ends up happening is instead of bringing up a right-click context menu for a textarea is it just shows a right-click context menu for the background body page
[22:50:17] <resting> i have this..
[22:50:25] <Cork> d[-_-]b: would be a lot easier to say if you showed the code instead
[22:50:34] <resting> $('#bnext').on('click', function() {
[22:50:34] <resting> 		clearInterval(slideShow.runSlideShow);
[22:50:34] <resting> 		slideShow.slideSwitch('next');
[22:50:34] <resting> 		console.log('d');
[22:50:34] <resting> 	});
[22:50:43] <Cork> ?p @ resting
[22:50:43] <bot-t> resting, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:50:46] <resting> but the console d only prints once
[22:50:53] <Cork> don't dump code in the channel
[22:52:13] <resting> ok here: http://jsbin.com/etehij/2/edit
[22:52:45] <resting> console d only prints once…y is that so?
[22:53:48] <d[-_-]b> Cork, I'll get that sorted now
[22:53:49] <poppiez> hi guys! when doing $el.parents('.sweet:first'); is it possible to look for two parents and pick the first one? $el.parents('.sweet:first').or('.sweeter:first'); :D
[22:54:16] <Cork> resting: your losing the this reference in slideShow.runSlideShow when your calling it like that; just so you remember that
[22:55:51] <resting> how shld i fix this?
[22:55:58] <poppiez> maybe I can use .closest()
[22:56:10] <Cork> resting: use an anonymus function
[22:56:28] <Cork> oh wait i might have missread your code
[22:56:39] <Cork> is runSlideShow a timer handle?
[22:56:50] <Cork> (bad naming if it is)
[22:57:03] <resting> hm…ya…w8..let me paste that portion as let
[22:57:05] <resting> well
[22:57:51] <Cork> resting: if posible make a working demo
[22:58:07] <resting> alrite heres everything http://jsbin.com/etehij/3/edit
[22:58:08] <Cork> its much easier to understand what your trying to do
[22:58:41] <Cork> resting: ugg, thats a wrong way of using setInterval
[22:58:49] <Cork> you shouldn't give it strings
[22:59:33] <resting> hmm…well…tats not wat i would wan to tackle for now
[23:00:01] <resting> the autorun timer is messing the slideshow when user clicks next n prev
[23:00:11] <resting> so i intend to clear it when its clicked
[23:00:15] <Cork> resting: it might actually be the cause of your problems
[23:00:26] <resting> and set it back after a timeout
[23:00:27] <Cork> (not the string part, but how you use the timer)
[23:00:28] <d[-_-]b> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/StPXg/
[23:00:53] <d[-_-]b> Cork, it wont run, just <3 the tidy up feature
[23:00:54] <resting> hm…got tat from a tutorial
[23:02:19] <Cork> d[-_-]b: that code has a race condition
[23:02:30] <resting> thing is, console d only prints once..although the slides does keep changing with each click
[23:02:36] <Cork> d[-_-]b: the setTimeout should be in the post callback
[23:02:55] <Cork> (or even better a complete callback)
[23:03:04] <d[-_-]b> Cork, yes that is true. miss paste there
[23:03:54] <Cork> d[-_-]b: and what variable is it your losing scope over?
[23:04:08] <d[-_-]b> Cork, im trying to use .splice and .push on data[z]
[23:04:24] <d[-_-]b> Cork, Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'splice' of undefined
[23:07:09] <Cork> d[-_-]b: same comment to you as i gave to resting before
[23:07:13] <Cork> don't use strings in timers
[23:07:19] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/StPXg/5/
[23:07:32] <Cork> not sure if that solves it, but give it a try
[23:08:18] <ItsMeLenny> did anybody want to help me getting blogger/blogspot to work with json (aka did anybody want to do most of the work for me)
[23:08:29] <Cork> d[-_-]b: and make sure you can access data in updateChart
[23:08:46] <coldhead> good luck with that lenny
[23:09:31] <resting> Cork: ah…found my mistake…i rebind the on click in my method…but i didn't bind it with the rest of the codes :s
[23:10:13] <d[-_-]b> Cork, Now that would make more logical sense, i couldn't understand why they placed it in as a string.
[23:10:39] <d[-_-]b> Cork, still the same issue, data[z] is loosing scope. I'll get you a working example mate
[23:11:27] <azk> is there an easy way to get datepicker to use iso time?
[23:11:46] <azk> yyyy-mm-dd
[23:14:35] <azk> nvm found it
[23:17:32] <d[-_-]b> Cork, didnt see your last comment, just testing some stuff now thanks.
[23:21:03] <Cork> and btw the reason you shouldn't use strings in timers, is 1. it can't be compiled by the browser, so its always traced and there by slow. 2. your losing scope as you can't have scope in strings
[23:24:27] <raj> rawr...looks like no one wants to answer this one
[23:24:59] <raj> do Files get their properties modified like objects if I create a new var reference to it, and then add a property onto that new var
[23:25:28] <Cork> raj: whats Files?
[23:25:30] <raj> var file = data.file[0], file.size = 10
[23:26:07] <Cork> raj: its an array of File references?
[23:26:11] <raj> will size now become part of data.file[0]?
[23:26:14] <raj> yes
[23:26:29] <raj> although it always has only 1 file
[23:26:46] <Cork> raj: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/File#Properties
[23:26:54] <Cork> "The size of the referenced file in bytes. Read only. Obsolete since Gecko 7.0"
[23:27:19] <Cork> opps wrong line ;P
[23:27:22] <raj> obsolete?
[23:27:26] <Cork> no
[23:27:33] <Cork> thats fileSize :)
[23:27:45] <Cork> "The size (in bytes) of the file referenced by the File object. Read only."
[23:28:22] <raj> so what happens if I define var data.files[0].size=10 ?
[23:28:26] <raj> it won't retain that value?
[23:28:37] <Cork> you'll prob get an error
[23:29:00] <d[-_-]b> Cork, Thanks for the advice, turns out, it was the while loops, bouncing over and extra time thus making data[z] undefined :)
[23:29:11] <d[-_-]b> an*
[23:29:12] <Cork> k
[23:30:16] <raj> Cork, it looks like I can't add any properties to file
[23:30:42] <Cork> raj: doesn't suprice me
[23:30:47] <raj> var file = data.files[0], file.abc = 10; gives an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[23:31:58] <raj> thanks Cork
[23:32:09] <Cork> np
[23:35:44] <azk> hmm
[23:36:02] <azk> $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker.formatDate($.datepicker.ISO_8601);
[23:36:12] <azk> what is wrong with this?
[23:37:08] <Cork> $.datepicker not $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker
[23:37:42] <Cork> its not a pre element setting
[23:37:43] <vl1234> hihi
[23:37:47] <azk> ok
[23:37:49] <azk> ty
[23:37:51] <vl1234> i have 1 small doubt
[23:38:04] <Cork> *per
[23:38:37] <azk> it's inside a function though, do I just append the #datepicker (which is the id of the input tag) to it then?
[23:39:05] <Cork> this only needs to be run ones when you load the page
[23:39:19] <azk> ah ok cool
[23:39:23] <Cork> the id isn't relevant
[23:39:39] <Cork> its a page global setting for datepicker
[23:40:00] <vl1234> i having  var a = ["10","20","30","40","50"] ..........here i want to how how to find the position of 40
[23:40:01] <azk> gotcha
[23:40:06] <vl1234> using jquery
[23:40:08] <dipser> $("#datepicker").datepicker();
[23:40:28] <Cork> ?eval var a = ["10","20","30","40","50"]; a.index('40')
[23:40:29] <caniuse> Cork: 'TypeError: Object 10,20,30,40,50 has no method \'index\''
[23:40:45] <Cork> uh...
[23:41:00] <dipser> indexOf ?
[23:41:15] <Cork> right >_<
[23:41:35] <Cork> ?eval var a = ["10","20","30","40","50"]; a.indexOf('40')
[23:41:36] <caniuse> Cork: 3
[23:47:43] <azk> ended up using setDefaults({dateFormat:'yy-mm-dd'}); that worked perfectly.
[23:58:23] <quuxman> Is there anyway to get the html source of a document fragment?
[23:58:56] <quuxman> I know there's some way, because when I inspect it with chrome's console, it shows the html source
[23:59:19] <StevenCodes> quicksilver, using ff you can use firebug
[23:59:22] <StevenCodes> an addon
[23:59:58] <quuxman> $(fragment).html() returns null
