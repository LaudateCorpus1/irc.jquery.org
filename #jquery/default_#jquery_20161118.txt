[00:09:33] <GeekMonkey> Thanks shoky_
[00:35:52] <talkJS> when debugging jquery, if i go to the events tab in chrome, I see the jquery.min. hooks for the events.   Is there anyway i can only see my callback functions?
[00:42:21] <iNeedToSwapImage> Hi. I'm currently working on a personal website, and I'm looking to switch an image with another when entering that image
[00:42:50] <iNeedToSwapImage> Note: I'm using a html map to define the area of the image, so it is not a normal rectangular shape
[00:43:17] <iNeedToSwapImage> The jquery code I've written currently does not work, and I need help figuring out why
[00:44:29] <iNeedToSwapImage> Here's the jsfiddle
[00:44:31] <iNeedToSwapImage> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=cJUJISxEEb
[00:46:18] <stoned> firstly, I would recommend not using image maps.
[00:46:55] <iNeedToSwapImage> Well, I really wanted that irregular shape for a link. Image mapping was the only way I could figure out how
[00:47:09] <stoned> CSS
[00:47:22] <stoned> https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-shapes/
[00:47:25] <stoned> Ask in #css
[00:52:10] <iNeedToSwapImage> Reading over that briefly, seems to me that's changing the shape of the image and allowing content to flow around it. I want the <a> to be non-rectangular as well
[00:53:34] <iNeedToSwapImage> Regardless, if I could have some help understanding why my jquery does not work, that would be great
[00:53:36] <Cork> stoned: css shapes is way WAY to new to be something you can use on the net yet
[00:54:27] <Cork> iNeedToSwapImage: also, please create a link by clicking the "save" button in jsfiddle
[00:54:54] <iNeedToSwapImage> https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/1/
[00:55:16] <iNeedToSwapImage> good?
[00:55:26] <Cork> yup
[00:55:54] <Cork> ok, function callbacks doesn't work the way you've done it there
[00:56:04] <Cork> .hove takes a function reference
[00:56:09] <Cork> hover*
[00:56:28] <iNeedToSwapImage> so just "swapImage", no params?
[00:56:37] <Cork> what you do is call swapImage() and give .hover the return value from that function (that is undefined)
[00:56:40] <Cork> exactly
[00:57:16] <Cork> give me a min to give you a better example
[01:02:54] <Cork> iNeedToSwapImage: https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/4/
[01:03:04] <Cork> that is how i would recommend solving it
[01:03:56] <iNeedToSwapImage> Cool, that's awesome.
[01:04:14] <iNeedToSwapImage> Less lines of code than what I had too
[01:05:40] <jak2000> Cork you know about network?
[01:05:47] <iNeedToSwapImage> Just to understand this better, the only data for the image that's being changed is the source, correct?
[01:05:59] <iNeedToSwapImage> So the html mapping I'm using will not be affected?
[01:06:21] <Cork> yup
[01:06:35] <Cork> iNeedToSwapImage: if you check the img tag there is a data-alt-image entry there now
[01:06:47] <Cork> the code swaps that and the src attribute value
[01:07:05] <Cork> iNeedToSwapImage: also when we're at it .data takes a key and value not just a value
[01:07:13] <iNeedToSwapImage> ah, gotcha. Hadn't noticed the html change.
[01:07:21] <Cork> kinda wasteful to limit it to the possibility of storing one string only
[01:07:43] <Cork> jak2000: i don't follow the question
[01:07:54] <iNeedToSwapImage> Okay
[01:13:39] <iNeedToSwapImage> Cork: I've got something interesting happening
[01:14:12] <iNeedToSwapImage> Image swapping is working, but only when I'm inside the div containing the image, but *not* when I'm over the image itself
[01:14:35] <Cork> then you've bound the event handler to the div not the image
[01:14:43] <Cork> .hover doesn't take children into account
[01:15:56] <iNeedToSwapImage> Using it on the img.leftmost, and class leftmost is correctly on the image
[01:16:17] <iNeedToSwapImage> New jsfiddle?
[01:17:52] <Cork> update it and click the update button and post the new url
[01:22:32] <iNeedToSwapImage> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/7/
[01:23:11] <iNeedToSwapImage> Added in the images I'm using, so the mapping is applying as intended.
[01:25:20] <Cork> iNeedToSwapImage: https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/8/
[01:25:29] <Cork> you need to bind the hover event to the area
[01:25:46] <Cork> else you will only get it to trigger when you hover the area of the image not covered by it
[01:27:04] <iNeedToSwapImage> right. I feel stupid
[01:27:22] <Cork> also you can do this with css and no extra images
[01:27:54] <iNeedToSwapImage> The image switching?
[01:28:04] <Cork> ya
[01:28:13] <Cork> or more specifically the effect you're after
[01:29:14] <iNeedToSwapImage> I'm curious. How would you go about making the image change with css?
[01:30:30] <iNeedToSwapImage> I understand you'd use the :hover tag, but the change to the image itself I have no clue how it would be done
[01:30:57] <systemfault> You change the background image.
[01:31:34] <systemfault> Or you use the same background image for the two states and change the background position on hover
[01:31:37] <systemfault> (better)
[01:32:27] <Cork> iNeedToSwapImage: https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/9/
[01:32:55] <Cork> (that result is from me hacking a little so it isn't exactly the same)
[01:33:47] <Cork> i don't remember if map css hover can do css effects on the img tag
[01:33:52] <Cork> was too long ago since i used it
[01:35:24] <iNeedToSwapImage> Okay, gotcha. Limited on custom effects that way though, no? Say if you wanted to change the border and text color of the image to red, and grey the rest out(Don't know why you would design-wise, just talking hypotheticals)
[01:35:41] <iNeedToSwapImage> then you'd have to use the way I now am currently using, yes?
[01:36:35] <Cork> iNeedToSwapImage: to be perfectly honest i would prob not use an image at all for that kind of look
[01:36:47] <Cork> it is doable with just html and css and would make the text easier to change
[01:37:23] <Cork> css transform rotate and and some before psudo elements and you can do it
[01:39:19] <iNeedToSwapImage> Cork: Alright. I'm just starting to get into more advanced web dev stuff (Only really did basic html and css w/ dropdown menus before), so clearly I've got a lot to learn
[01:44:38] <Cork> iNeedToSwapImage: again, just some quick hacking https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/10/
[01:48:54] <iNeedToSwapImage> Okay, gotta admit, that's pretty cool
[01:50:31] <Cork> the best part is then you can drop shadow affect background and what not with just :hover
[01:53:55] <iNeedToSwapImage> Alright, well I'm going to head off. Thank you so much for all your help Cork
[01:54:01] <Cork> np
[01:54:15] <iNeedToSwapImage> You keep being awesome
[04:21:09] <sonu_nk>  hi to write this strtotime("2016-11-18 00:00:01")  from PHP to JS , how i will do this
[04:21:30] <Cork> sonu_nk: from php to js?
[04:21:42] <Cork> what exactly do you mean by write here?
[04:21:50] <sonu_nk> from PHP to JavaScript or Jquery
[04:21:55] <Cork> you can't
[04:22:07] <Cork> you can either write it into the html page and have javascript parse it from there
[04:22:17] <sonu_nk> i want to write its equilent in javascript or jquery strtotime("2016-11-18 00:00:01")
[04:22:25] <Cork> or you can have a separate ajax endpoint that javascript can call and get the data as ex. json
[04:22:32] <Cork> you can't write
[04:22:39] <Cork> ah
[04:22:45] <Cork> you want to convert the code
[04:22:50] <Cork> look at moment.js
[04:22:51] <sonu_nk> yes Cok
[04:28:14] <sonu_nk> Cork i am trying same with moment but not getting how to do

[04:37:23] <stillANoobAtJQue> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=JOsJzc9CEs
[04:39:16] <stillANoobAtJQue> Nothing happens when I click the object with the "leftmost" id, and I don't know why. It should send me to the new url, no?
[04:40:00] <Cork> you forgot to save the link
[04:41:25] <stillANoobAtJQue> Save the link? As in as a var?
[04:41:37] <Cork> as in the "save" button
[04:41:48] <Cork> your link https://jsfiddle.net/ <--
[04:42:33] <MaximusColourum> So it has been quite a while since I have done frontend work myself.  I'm struggling with a dev team which is trying to use Slick carousel to implement a menu tray with horizontal scrolling across layered navigation and filters.
[04:42:39] <MaximusColourum> Can anyone suggest what are some of the modern 2016 approaches to getting native application like touch menus and behaviors.
[04:43:30] <MaximusColourum> I'm seeking a touch scroll library which will allow inline blocks of any width scroll horizontally.
[04:43:33] <Cork> those are normally done through js and the touch event
[04:44:05] <MaximusColourum> Right? Can't this be done natively with modern jquery and jquery mobile?
[04:44:12] <stillANoobAtJQue> Alright, jsfiddle is acting up. Can't save a link at all right now
[04:48:07] <stillANoobAtJQue> Any reason why the save/update buttons would not change the jsfiddle link?
[04:48:41] <Cork> MaximusColourum: jquery mobile might provide something, can't really tell you
[04:49:25] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: they could have server problems, it used to happen from time to time
[04:49:30] <Cork> haven't seen it in a long time though
[04:49:47] <Cork> and it works fine for me
[04:49:58] <stillANoobAtJQue> Yeah, idk. Just staying at jsfiddle.net no matter what.
[04:49:58] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/39mptq7L/
[04:50:58] <stillANoobAtJQue> Well this is interesting. Even when I click update on your link, it changes the url to just be jsfiddle.net
[04:51:06] <stillANoobAtJQue> Gonna try clearing cookies
[04:52:57] <stillANoobAtJQue> Okay, this is even weirder than I thought. It's not letting me update when I have my jquery code pasted in
[04:55:23] <stillANoobAtJQue> Alright, figured it out. My code has window.location.href in it. jsfiddle doesn't like that, which makes sense, given that it runs the code
[04:55:45] <Cork> hmm
[04:55:48] <Cork> it shouldn't actually
[04:55:52] <Cork> as the code runs in an iframe
[04:56:04] <Cork> so you would change the url of the iframe page
[04:56:05] <stillANoobAtJQue> Idk. As soon as I take that out it lets me save it
[04:56:13] <stillANoobAtJQue> https://jsfiddle.net/39mptq7L/8/
[04:56:26] <stillANoobAtJQue> replaced it with w.l.href
[04:56:37] <stillANoobAtJQue> Won't run, but at least it lets me save it
[04:59:36] <Cork> ya, it is cause of the security restriction jsfiddle puts on the iframe
[04:59:46] <Cork> sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-modals"
[05:00:45] <Cork> though you should as far as possible try to use <a> tags for page navigation not window.location
[05:01:30] <TotallyNotKim> ^this
[05:01:40] <TotallyNotKim> otherwise the google index plays dumb
[05:01:46] <TotallyNotKim> if relevant
[05:01:59] <Cork> not only that
[05:02:11] <Cork> it breaks things like ctrl+click and a lot of other things
[05:02:34] <Cork> (like accessibility for none seeing visitors)
[05:02:58] <stillANoobAtJQue> Right. I couldnt figure out a way to get a <a> tag in what I have. I want the link to be irregurally shaped, but no matter what I tried it just used the rectangle of the div
[05:03:06] <TotallyNotKim> also it breaks my middle click to open in new tab
[05:03:10] <TotallyNotKim> and I _hate_ that
[05:03:12] <TotallyNotKim> :P
[05:03:33] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: use the solution i gave you last time we talked
[05:04:01] <Cork> with the slight difference of using two a tags
[05:05:03] <stillANoobAtJQue> I have very little understanding of what you coded then though, and I don't want to utilize code that I don't get.
[05:11:12] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: there https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/11/
[05:11:16] <Cork> that is what you need
[05:11:19] <Cork> opps
[05:11:32] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/12/
[05:11:45] <Cork> more cleanup https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/13/
[05:12:08] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: what is does is quite normal css + css3 transform
[05:12:15] <Pradeep1122> I am a beginner in jquery and want to know what is passed when $("button").click( //what is called here?) is called. Please let me know
[05:12:46] <Cork> Pradeep1122: .click is an overloaded helper function
[05:12:51] <Cork> it has two uses
[05:13:08] <Cork> either it does a .trigger('click') or it does an .on('click', func)
[05:13:27] <Cork> .click(function() {}) => .on('click', function() {})
[05:13:37] <Cork> and .click() => .trigger('click')
[05:13:47] <stillANoobAtJQue> Bit confused as to what the :before selector is doing in that
[05:14:11] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements
[05:14:32] <Pradeep1122> @Cork: So if I call a $("button").click(console.log(this)), does it create a anonymous function and put the statement inside the function block and execute the statement
[05:14:39] <Cork> no
[05:14:44] <Cork> Pradeep1122: what is just invalid code
[05:15:03] <Cork> opps
[05:15:08] <Cork> THAT is*
[05:15:38] <Cork> for that to do anything you have to wrap it in an anonymous function
[05:16:11] <Cork> alternatively you can do $('').click(console.log) and it will log the arguments the callback would have gotten
[05:16:24] <Cork> (in this case the event object)
[05:20:57] <Pradeep1122> @Cork: Thanks. I got it also if I pass a function and use the `this` keyword inside the function, the this will be bound to the button object right
[05:21:29] <Cork> yes
[05:21:48] <Cork> same goes for an anonymous function though
[05:22:02] <Cork> $('button').click(function() { $(this) })
[05:22:19] <Pradeep1122> @Cork: one more thing, what would be like the code inside the click function of jquery, will it just call the function passed?
[05:23:14] <Cork> Pradeep1122: extreamly simplified but .on = function(event, handler) { this.addEventListener(event, handler); }
[05:23:53] <Cork> so $('button').click(function() {}) => $('button')[0].addEventListener('click', function() {})
[05:24:27] <Cork> and that is about the same as document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function() {});
[05:25:07] <Cork> .on can do a lot more then just straight addEventListener though
[05:25:16] <Cork> but for .click is is a straight match
[05:25:57] <Pradeep1122> @Cork: extreamly simplified but .on = function(event, handler) { this.addEventListener(event, handler); }
[05:25:58] <Cork> Pradeep1122: the big difference is that $('button') matches all button elements in the page
[05:26:15] <Cork> while document.querySelector('button') only handles the first match
[05:26:21] <Pradeep1122> in the above statement, the this will be bound to the object on which teh event is called right
[05:26:34] <Cork> Pradeep1122: the dom element, but ya
[05:27:13] <Pradeep1122> oh!! got it since in a function the `this`  will be bound to the window object by default
[05:27:27] <Cork> ya, but not for event handlers
[05:27:52] <Cork> addEventListener is setting this to the dom element the event handler is bound on
[05:27:55] <Pradeep1122> then for event handlers, where will be the definition of `this` be defined
[05:28:20] <Cork> its defined in addEventListener
[05:28:30] <Pradeep1122> ok.
[05:28:52] <Pradeep1122> time to dive into the inner workings to be good as a javascript programmer
[05:29:07] <Cork> Pradeep1122: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#The_value_of_this_within_the_handler
[05:29:10] <Pradeep1122> thanks Cork
[05:30:01] <Pradeep1122> awesome Cork. Thanks for sharing
[05:30:20] <Cork> Pradeep1122: also i can recommend reading code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[05:30:33] <Cork> it is quite well written and if your interested in javascript a good read
[05:30:42] <Pradeep1122> few more haunting questions in my head. who is maintaining the javascript language now after netscape
[05:31:03] <Cork> mozilla
[05:31:15] <Cork> the javascript is an implementation in a specific engine
[05:31:28] <Cork> the specific language has never been javascript
[05:31:35] <Cork> it is actually called EcmaScript
[05:31:37] <Pradeep1122> ok. and what happened to Jscript from Microsoft. Is it still around
[05:31:44] <Cork> it is still jscript
[05:31:50] <Pradeep1122> ecmascript was the specification right
[05:31:51] <Cork> it is there implementation of ecmascript
[05:32:05] <Cork> ecmascript is the language
[05:32:10] <Cork> and the specification
[05:32:35] <Pradeep1122> so javascript is just the trademark for ecmascript which is owned by Oracle
[05:32:39] <Pradeep1122> is it correct
[05:32:56] <Cork> no
[05:33:07] <Cork> oracle owns java not javascript
[05:33:17] <Cork> javascript has nothing to do with java what so ever
[05:34:02] <Cork> (well except netscape picked "java" as part of the name for marketing reasons back in the 90's)
[05:34:31] <Pradeep1122> so ecmascript is the specificaton as well as the implementation, jscript is the implementation of ecmascript from microsoft right Cork
[05:34:42] <Cork> no
[05:34:53] <Cork> ecmascript is the language and the specification
[05:35:01] <Cork> jscript is microsofts implementation
[05:35:12] <Cork> javascript is netscape/mozillas implementation
[05:35:31] <Pradeep1122> ok and what is used in the browsers like chrome and safari
[05:35:31] <Cork> google/apples doesn't have a specific name per se
[05:35:41] <Cork> but there engines run javascript
[05:36:23] <Cork> so you have engines the engine runs implementations and the implementations follow a language and the language is a specification
[05:37:57] <Cork> and the implementation part is nameless in nitro(apple) and v8 (google) as far as i know
[05:38:45] <Cork> chakra runs jscript (microsoft)

[05:39:05] <stillANoobAtJQue> I messed around with it a bit so I could understand what everything did. Think I've got it now
[05:39:44] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: you might want to put the border on the .menu element instead of the :before and a links
[05:39:52] <Cork> makes is a bit cleaner
[05:40:03] <Cork> ah, no sorry forgot you don't
[05:40:19] <Cork> cause that would put the tilted border wrong
[05:41:09] <stillANoobAtJQue> Yeah, that'd put a border on the whole block, rather than on the slant
[05:46:39] <stillANoobAtJQue> Well, thanks for the help again Cork
[05:47:16] <stillANoobAtJQue> Think I'm going to stay in chat this time. Might as well, since I've pulled an all nighter and will probably just keep at this

[06:15:32] <stillANoobAtJQue> Right, but I mean a custom look entirely, not default
[06:15:58] <Cork> if you can wait out the next css spec it has custom styling
[06:16:11] <Cork> but ya, :after is about the best you can have until then
[06:16:33] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-style

[08:31:03] <mechanist> how can I know if this input field is empty on jquery? <input type='file' name='file' />
[08:31:45] <mechanist> i need of an input handler to raise an ouput error if no files are submitted
[08:43:27] <stillANoobAtJQue> I'm beginning to think pulling an allnighter was a bad idea
[08:58:57] <Cork> mechanist: $('input')[0].files.length == 0
[08:59:56] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: got the :hover part sorted out?
[09:00:48] <stillANoobAtJQue> Currently asking in #css, they sort of helped. Using .navbarMiddle:hover a{} but it seems to be a bit messed up
[09:03:07] <AlexP11223> Is it possible to .serialize() form using specified encoding (such as CP1252) for text? I am writiing a script for a website that as far as I can see expects requests like "?query=%E2%E8%E4%E5%EE", but .serialize() produces "query=%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BE"
[09:03:35] <Cork> AlexP11223: it isn't serialize controlling that
[09:03:43] <Cork> the page encoding does
[09:04:12] <Cork> (though ugg... all servers should expect utf8 now days)
[09:04:32] <AlexP11223> yeah, it's an old website
[09:06:08] <AlexP11223> hm. then why when the form is sent manually from the same page the request is created using different encoding?oO
[09:06:45] <Cork> AlexP11223: you have to make sure the page uses the same encoding
[09:06:59] <Cork> encoding can be controlled per form separately
[09:07:07] <Cork> but that doesn't affect js
[09:07:42] <dakar> http://pastebin.com/raw/T5y72DG8
[09:07:45] <dakar> what's wrong with this
[09:08:14] <Cork> dakar: depends on where that code is called
[09:08:26] <AlexP11223> the page has meta tag Content-Type charset=windows-1251, but .serialize() returns utf-8 =\
[09:08:33] <Cork> hmm
[09:09:14] <AlexP11223> and server response for the page has Content-Type:text/html; charset=windows-1251 too
[09:09:52] <stillANoobAtJQue> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/0wqcuzs9/1/
[09:11:40] <Cork> ah...
[09:12:00] <Cork> AlexP11223: you could try setting utf-8 as content type for the ajax post
[09:12:03] <Cork> that MIGHT work
[09:12:27] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: wow... what exactly are you trying to do?
[09:12:59] <Cork> the rest of the menu bar?
[09:13:57] <stillANoobAtJQue> Cork: The center piece for the nav bar, ye. So 3 psuedos xD
[09:17:05] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: i will try to build an example
[09:17:13] <Cork> but i have other things i have to do so it will go a little slow
[09:17:52] <stillANoobAtJQue> Np. I probably got a few things wrong. You get the idea of the shape I'm aiming for though, yeah?
[09:18:15] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: ya, you entered multiple menu entries in the one entry wrapper
[09:18:52] <Cork> very incomplete but this is the base of how it should look https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/24/
[09:30:16] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: https://jsfiddle.net/gzzufj53/25/
[09:30:34] <Cork> you want a "tilt" on the right side too?
[09:30:54] <dakar> Cork I handled it with the document.ready. it works now.
[09:31:22] <Cork> dakar: .ready is deprecated in jq 3.1, so i recommend you use $(function() {}) instead
[09:32:25] <stillANoobAtJQue> Cork: We had a miscommunication :'(
[09:33:02] <stillANoobAtJQue> Cork: Navbar: tiltLeft, straightBox, centerTrapezoid-thing, straightBox, tiltRight
[09:33:21] <stillANoobAtJQue> this: https://jsfiddle.net/0wqcuzs9/1/ was my attempt at doing the center Trap
[09:33:53] <stillANoobAtJQue> I'm getting the shape(With the exception of the excess on the top), but I'm not getting the hovers to work
[09:36:57] <Cork> ah, so you want both sides on the center part?
[09:37:24] <Cork> stillANoobAtJQue: ya, the container (.menu) is very important
[09:37:36] <Cork> it crops the visible area
[09:37:44] <Cork> you can only have one in each of those
[09:37:58] <Cork> and that is what i ilustrated in the new fiddle
[09:38:10] <Cork> (there each menu entry has it's own li)
[09:38:58] <stillANoobAtJQue> Yeah, currently using a ul(+li's obviously) on my local. So I should just use the li's as the wrapper?
[09:39:09] <Cork> yes
[09:39:11] <stillANoobAtJQue> *wrappers
[09:39:16] <Cork> look at the latest fiddle
[09:39:33] <Cork> the class="tilt" link is for the mouse effect
[09:40:08] <Cork> the tilt ALWAYS have to be before "real" link
[09:40:13] <Cork> or things break
[09:40:39] <Cork> so to get a \__/ kinda of look you have to have two tilt followed by the real link
[09:41:07] <stillANoobAtJQue> Oh, okay. Didn't know it had to be before
[09:41:10] <Cork> (would prob rename them to tilt-left and tilt-right)
[09:41:25] <Cork> it is cause else it can't emulate the hover effect on the link
[09:41:34] <Cork> as selectors can't match elements before the target
[09:41:39] <Cork> but it can match elements after it
[09:42:03] <Cork> anyway have to get back to work
[09:42:26] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:43:05] <jomofcw> Is there any math addict there :P ? I'm trying to change the ratio/scale of a "matrix" css property, but it's kinda hard :/...
[09:45:11] <jomofcw> Using the freetrans plugin (https://github.com/gthmb/jquery-free-transform) cloupling with the draggable plugin of jQuery UI, I enable my user to move/rotate/scale an image in a zone. Then they record the "project". And I have to display the result in diferent ratio/scale (i.e. smaller view). Let's see an example there : https://postimg.org/image/ddbhwx97l/
[09:47:00] <jomofcw> So i need to recalculate the value of the "matrix" css. For the fourth first items, it's easy, I simply miltiply them using the ratio used to display the project. For the two last (transX and transY) it's harder. Someone from #math help me doing it and it work, but only if the user haven't change the scale of the original added image. Else, it doesn't work, because the function probably miss
[09:47:00] <jomofcw> an element.
[09:51:07] <stillANoobAtJQue> Cork: Just wanted to say thank you for all the help you've given me yerstday/today/tonight/this morning. You're a great help, and even better person for having patience with my ineptitude.
[10:13:04] <flowdy> hello guys!
[10:18:20] <flowdy> I've got an issue after updating jquery-ui 1.11.4 -> 1.12.1: In jquery-ui.js:537, there is a "TypeError: options.extra.match is not a function"
[10:19:28] <flowdy> same as with jquery 1.9.1 by the way (just reads differently "e.extra.match ...").
[10:20:18] <flowdy> googling this message was to no avail so I am currently stuck. you know things I could check?
[10:20:44] <flowdy> browser: firefox 45.4.0
[10:24:24] <FilipNortic_> flowdy: check which ui versions go with which jQuery versions
[10:24:27] <Cork> flowdy: make sure you're using a supported version of jquery
[10:24:40] <Cork> heh
[10:24:52] <FilipNortic_> 1.9.1 is a bit old
[10:24:53] <Cork> cause ya, jquery and jquery-ui goes in pair
[10:26:04] <Cork> ya, at least update to jqeury 1.12
[10:26:43] <FilipNortic_> but i just founnd a jQuery 1.5 on one of my servers
[10:26:56] <FilipNortic_> was used as fallback when cdn borke
[10:27:09] <Cork> <_<'
[10:27:10] <Cork> ouch
[10:27:21] <MassDebates> !
[10:27:26] <MassDebates> A wild jquery appeared!
[10:27:33] <MassDebates> jQuery used "$ undefined!"
[10:27:39] <MassDebates> ITS SUPER EFFECTIVE!
[10:27:42] * Cork throws MassDebates a pocket ball
[10:27:58] * MassDebates already has 2 pocket balls o.O
[10:28:01] <flowdy> Cork, tried on jquery 1.9.1, 2.2.4 and 3.1.1
[10:28:32] <Cork> flowdy: and same errors on all of them?
[10:29:49] <flowdy> yes, except it reads "e.extra.match ..." for 1.9.1
[10:30:05] <Cork> time to reproduce it in a jsfiddle then
[10:35:08] <flowdy> Cork, okay will try that and return.
[10:36:32] <flowdy> As this error occurs on a specific (non-public) page in my site, this seems to be an edge case.
[11:04:48] <flowdy> Cork: In my endeavour to track the problem down to what could be jsfiddlable, I realized that a bug in my client code is in fact causing this type error.
[11:07:58] <flowdy> that is, a code fragment did not work before the update, but it didn't yielded a type error.
[11:47:50] * flowdy is back again
[11:48:05] <flowdy> so I know what to ask
[11:48:35] <flowdy> I have a couple of html5 <button> elements
[11:49:01] <flowdy> I make a $(...).buttonset() out of it
[11:50:06] <flowdy> then on a specific button I run mybtn.button("option", "label", "My label") - works.
[11:51:46] <flowdy> but I cannot apply an icon: mybtn.button("option", "icon", { icon: "ui-icon-folder-open" }) -> TypeError: options.extra.match(...) is not a function
[11:52:08] <flowdy> this *is* a bug, isn't it?
[11:52:46] <flowdy> let's see I can reproduce it in a jsfiddle ...
[11:56:26] <flowdy> but, oh, I see, will try if I can reproduce it with controlgroup()
[11:59:49] <flowdy> ... yes.
[12:05:42] <RonaldsMazitis> my jqplot doesn't draws a line when plotting line from dates
[12:05:42] <RonaldsMazitis> http://apaste.info/5S3Xb
[12:15:42] <RonaldsMazitis> hi robertMeeting wassup
[12:23:48] <taplar> fry day fry day, gotta get down on fry day
[12:51:54] <sgrover> Easy question.  I thought $('#myform').submit() would bypass any event handlers for onSubmit...  That does not seem to be the case.  Using jquery 1.7.1 via Magento.
[12:52:24] <taplar> on submit as in the inline bindings?
[12:53:10] <sgrover> So I have $('#myform').on('submit', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); });  - to prevent accidental submission via the Enter key in a text box.  Then later I do $('#myform').submit() in the click event for an anchor tag.
[12:53:26] <taplar> $().get(0).submit()
[12:53:55] <sgrover> $('#myform').get(0).submit()?
[12:54:01] <taplar> yes
[12:54:06] <sgrover> refer to the dom element directly then... makes sense
[12:56:44] <sgrover> hmm.. might have been caching at play.  Doing the .get(0).submit() works.  But now doing the $('#myform').submit() works as expected too, whereas it failed outright beforehand.
[12:57:22] <taplar> iirc $().submit() will usually cause jQuery bind logic to fire
[12:57:23] <sgrover> nm... forgot I disabled the preventDefault()
[12:59:16] <Caspan> .on('click', '#ModalClose' function() {$(this).style.display = "none";} )
[12:59:22] <Caspan> i know i am doign somethign wrong here
[12:59:33] <taplar> just use 'this'
[12:59:34] <Caspan> I want to change a style on the item
[12:59:36] <taplar> don't wrap it
[12:59:49] <taplar> otherwise, $(this).hide()
[12:59:55] <Caspan> ahh
[13:00:05] <Caspan> when do you wrap this?
[13:00:11] <Caspan> why smetimes and not other times
[13:00:19] <taplar> any time you want access to jQuery methods that need a stack
[13:00:21] <anexit> Anyone here good with iframes?
[13:00:36] <anexit> trying to make the following larger to fit my forms;
[13:00:38] <anexit> https://jsfiddle.net/ctuewsxp/7/
[13:00:44] <taplar> $(selector).method() <-- method will be executed on all the elements found with selector
[13:00:51] <sgrover> Caspan: as taplar said.  Or you can do $('...').css('display', 'none');  If you must alter the css
[13:01:58] <Caspan> thank you
[13:02:05] <sgrover> anexit: the content of the iframe larger or the iframe itself?
[13:02:10] <shoky_> anexit: you can't access the frame's content from the outer page if they're not from the same domain/origin
[13:02:21] <shoky_> so you can't get the body height
[13:02:32] <anexit> sgrover, larger
[13:02:42] <anexit> I would like to auto-size it
[13:03:18] <anexit> There are some forms that allow users to drop urls to syntax music
[13:03:28] <anexit> Yet.. you can't see them
[13:03:29] <anexit> haha
[13:03:40] <sgrover> you can do <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 80px;" src="..."></iframe>
[13:04:01] <sgrover> But as shoky said - if the src is a different domain you cannot alter the contents of the iframe
[13:04:12] <anexit> same domain
[13:04:16] <shoky_> you can't resize a cross-origin iframe to fit its content
[13:04:27] <shoky_> no need to alter the contents of the iframe, but you can't access its height
[13:04:54] <sgrover> shoky_: agreed, but you can alter the size of the box the iframe appears in.
[13:05:03] <anexit> ^ that
[13:05:07] <anexit> is what I need
[13:05:14] <shoky_> but you dont know what to resize it to
[13:05:19] <shoky_> if you can't get the iframe body's height
[13:05:30] <shoky_> but if you say it's the same domain.. then it should be possible
[13:05:34] <sgrover> anexit: do you control the content in the iframe?
[13:05:39] <anexit> yeah
[13:06:02] <Caspan> taplar: $('modal-content').on('click', '#ModalClose', function() {$(this).hide();} )
[13:06:08] <Caspan> that is my whole statment
[13:06:18] <Caspan> does not seem to hide the element
[13:06:23] <taplar> nope
[13:06:29] <taplar> look at your selectors
[13:06:42] <Caspan> the parent item is modal-content
[13:06:48] <Caspan> selector is modal-content
[13:06:50] <taplar> that's not a html tag
[13:07:01] <Caspan> fricek
[13:07:02] <Caspan> .
[13:07:08] <taplar> :)
[13:07:10] <sgrover> then in the iframe document you can do something like this:  $(window.top).find('#myiframe').height($('body').height));
[13:07:22] <shoky_> or just do what you already have
[13:07:26] <Caspan> that did it
[13:07:30] <shoky_> should work fine if it's the same domain
[13:07:39] <shoky_> assuming the scrollHeight is at the value you want on load
[13:09:17] <shoky_> see it resizes - https://jsfiddle.net/ctuewsxp/8/   though not a lot in this case because jsfiddle sizes the body to fit the frame
[13:10:00] <sgrover> anexit: when working inside a frame the "window" object refers to the document window (the iframe).  "window.top" refers to the topmost window.  "window.parent" refers to the containing window of the current document.  Using this you can alter the DOM of parent windows.
[13:10:18] <sgrover> er... parent documents.
[13:10:45] <shoky_> no need to access parent document.. you can access child frames too as he's already doing
[13:11:09] <sgrover> Trying to alter the content of CHILD documents is fraught with problems - especially if the child is in different domains.
[13:11:26] <shoky_> but he's NOT trying to alter the content of the child
[13:11:31] <shoky_> nor is it in a different domain..
[13:11:43] <sgrover> shoky_: understood.  But a) he said that code is not working, and b) he asked for help from someone who knew how to work with iframes.
[13:12:32] <shoky_> oks
[13:13:00] <sgrover> That indicates to me that he is looking for a solution to communicate between frames.  You are not wrong shoky_ - I'm just trying to offer the larger picture awareness for him.
[13:13:49] <shoky_> ok but you're implying that doing it your way should work any better
[13:14:03] <anexit> I can use css actually
[13:14:06] <sgrover> I didn't say that.. :)
[13:14:09] <anexit> This looks much better
[13:14:20] <shoky_> you can't use css to resize an iframe to fit its contents
[13:14:26] <shoky_> afaik at least
[13:14:38] <_genuser_> hi devs.
[13:14:54] <anexit> You place the iframe inside a div
[13:15:12] <anexit> resize the div
[13:15:17] <shoky_> to what size :)
[13:15:18] <_genuser_> hi devs
[13:15:21] <sgrover> We have faced the issue a few times, and using styles/css to alter the iframe itself (the box, not the contents of the box) usually addresses the issue.
[13:15:24] <anexit> absolute
[13:15:32] <_genuser_> my messages not making it to this channel.
[13:15:37] <shoky_> point being you can size the iframe to the same size you would size the div..
[13:15:38] <anexit> hmm
[13:15:48] <_genuser_> hello people.
[13:15:49] <sgrover> depending on the height involved.
[13:15:51] <anexit> yeah, I don't like the look of the css
[13:15:52] <shoky_> the div doesn't giv you anything
[13:16:10] <shoky_> _genuser_ we see your messages
[13:16:30] <_genuser_> shoky_: oh, my irssi was hung up on this channel only. odd. had to leave/rejoin
[13:16:54] <sgrover> anexit: careful - hold down the CTRL key and scroll your mouse wheel to change font sizes.  The layout may change unexpectedly... that's normally an edge case though.
[13:17:50] <anexit> hmm
[13:18:01] <sgrover> shoky_: if the iframe had a width of 100%, then the containing div can be used to alter the width/position of the iframe.  But yeah, you can just apply that same CSS to the iframe itself.
[13:18:39] <anexit> basically I need to fit this into a small window
[13:18:40] <anexit> https://uploadapp.net/soundbar/examples/play.html
[13:20:19] <anexit> in my members area, I have 680x308 px to play with
[13:20:21] <anexit> :D
[13:20:35] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/46ou71vj/
[13:20:38] <taplar> playing around
[13:20:44] <anexit> iframes are just an ugly thing
[13:21:15] <anexit> hmm
[13:25:18] <anexit> taplar that might work
[13:27:27] <anexit> Awesome

[16:25:25] <qakhan> hi all, i am trying to add row  in datatable with colspan=3
[16:26:29] <qakhan> first row added but next rows are updating the previous row and add emtpy rows above that. here is my code http://pastebin.com/0e8CP1RG
[16:30:38] <taplar> https://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/row_grouping.html shows on line 16 how it is doing colspans
[16:31:34] <MassDebates> Okay dude
[16:31:42] <MassDebates> taplar:  that's ridiculous and a terrible resource.
[16:31:52] <taplar> it's DT.  that's a given
[16:31:55] <MassDebates> No WAY is a man named "Tiger Nixon", 61 years old, AND a systems architect.
[16:32:00] <MassDebates> Oh, yeah, that too.
[16:32:04] <MassDebates> But cmon.
[16:32:07] <MassDebates> "tiger nixon"?
[16:32:17] <MassDebates> Wtf, did Tiger woods shag Mrs. Nixon?
[16:32:32] <MassDebates> :P
[16:34:19] <taplar> anyone here use sahi by chance?
[16:55:54] <qakhan> taplar i have tired your provided link. but its grouping the rows base on column name
[16:56:23] <qakhan> i am creating group manually.
[17:02:26] <taplar> it's grouping the rows based on the value of one of the columns
[17:02:47] <taplar> shouldn't be hard to inject your dynamic group into a column
[17:02:48] <qakhan> mine is not.
[17:04:11] <qakhan> i am adding a row (groupname) with colspan=3. then add rows under (groupname)row
[17:18:26] <[Awaxx]> well found it out
[17:18:35] <[Awaxx]> it was the scope

[17:19:57] <Caspan> i also want it to fire that ajax call below it
[17:20:20] <Caspan> both work fine on their own but I cannot seem to combine them
[17:20:43] <Caspan> sorry link will work now
[17:22:29] <taplar> can you show us how you are trying to combine them?
[17:23:10] <Caspan> sure
[17:24:24] <Caspan> http://pastebin.com/xWDCNr9a
[17:24:30] <Caspan> thats how i was thinking to get it to work
[17:24:51] <taplar> ok, what about that is not working as you expect?
[17:25:04] <Caspan> the ajax never seems to fire
[17:25:20] <taplar> how did you verify that?
[17:26:00] <Caspan> well when i run the ajax code by its selft the HTML shows up
[17:26:10] <Caspan> when i put it in this selector the HTML does not show up
[17:26:12] <taplar> are there any console errors?  do you see the request in your network tab?  have you put a console log in that event handler to see that it prints?
[17:26:19] <Caspan> no console errors
[17:26:32] <Caspan> i have not tried a console.log yet
[17:28:52] <Caspan> err im an idiot
[17:28:54] <Caspan> again
[17:29:11] <Caspan> that selector is when you click on the X to close the window
[17:29:20] <Caspan> so i bet it will work when i close the modal window!!
[17:29:23] <Caspan> doh!!!!!!
[17:30:45] <Caspan> works now!!
[17:30:54] <Caspan> when i add it to the correct selector!
[18:11:54] <qakhan> is it possible to add row in a table by jquery and after refresh the page newly created row stay in table?
[18:13:51] <taplar> no, you'll have to rebuild it each time
[18:14:44] <taplar> unless the page you are refreshing is pulling the data from a dynamic source, and when you create the row on the frontend you also send a request to the backend to update that source so when it pulls again it will have the new row
[18:16:03] <qakhan> taplar what is the best way to do that?
[18:16:35] <taplar> are you pulling the initial table data from a dynamic source?
[18:17:47] <qakhan> no its just blank table
[18:18:29] <taplar> then you're going to have to figure out a way to preserve that
[18:18:40] <qakhan> DB?
[18:18:52] <taplar> or potentially a sessionStorage variable
[18:19:28] <qakhan> i need it even after the browser restart
[18:19:39] <taplar> then localStorage
[18:20:27] <taplar> if you want it to persist through cache clears or on different pcs (if there is an account involved) then it would be a DB option
[18:21:59] <qakhan> can you please give me some example to table, tr, th , td save in DB
[18:22:32] <taplar> no, lol.  that's not a simple thing to write man
[18:23:34] <taplar> browser side it would be an ajax call to a server endpoint giving it the new row.  but you will have to have some way to identify the user with their data too.
[18:23:47] <taplar> so, lots of stuff to think about
[18:24:47] <qakhan> hmm ok
[19:16:15] <quechon> yesterday i created a form to use ajax and it was working fine now i try to do the same with an app im working on i get bad request https://paste.pound-python.org/show/Jjz1V3yoIfDqUl511qCN/
[19:16:23] <quechon> dont understand why
[19:16:57] <quechon> i compared it with the working one and to my knowledge everything is ok
[19:18:18] <shoky_> quechon: $('csrf_token')  is probably wrong
[19:19:16] <cannap> sure
[19:19:38] <cannap> its an # or .
[19:19:39] <cannap> .
[19:19:44] <cannap> .
[19:19:47] <cannap> oh
[19:19:56] <cannap> sry
[19:19:57] <quechon> wow how did i miss that
[19:20:07] <quechon> stupid me
[19:20:14] <cannap> ah np
[19:20:22] <cannap> we know this problem
[19:20:28] <cannap> because jquery :P
[19:20:43] <Caspan> i have a HTML table with multi rows and 7 columns
[19:20:56] <cannap> good to know
[19:20:58] <Caspan> is ther a way that in each column i can select only one TD
[19:21:05] <cannap> each
[19:21:06] <cannap> td
[19:21:28] <taplar> there's an nth-child selector iirc
[19:21:46] <cannap> or this one
[19:21:48] <Caspan> if there is another TD in the column slected it would unslect that and select this td
[19:22:05] <Caspan> taht way you can only select one TD per column
[19:22:15] <taplar> hold on
[19:22:19] <Caspan> NP
[19:22:22] <taplar> what are you referring to as 'select'
[19:22:35] <Caspan> put a selected class on it lets say
[19:22:40] <taplar> lol
[19:22:51] <Caspan> that will turn the background blue or some color then i can parse all the selected tags
[19:22:56] <taplar> dude, you have to tell us that stuff.  i thought you were referring to how to select them with $()
[19:23:06] <cannap> oO
[19:23:11] <Caspan> sorry Jquery and i and saying selected...
[19:23:14] <Caspan> my bad
[19:23:39] <cannap> np
[19:23:40] <taplar> so with that in mind, can you restate your question?
[19:24:22] <cannap> we are here to help and not complaint are you using jquery :O
[19:24:45] <cannap> -t
[19:25:17] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/e29cv85h/
[19:25:22] <Caspan> if you look at that table
[19:25:49] <cannap> i just see html
[19:26:01] <Caspan> i want to be able to add a class to one TD only in each column
[19:26:12] <Caspan> so in the dat column i can select only one of them
[19:26:12] <cannap> each
[19:26:27] <taplar> which td?
[19:26:30] <Caspan> sorry
[19:26:35] <Caspan> restate again
[19:26:38] <quechon> in plain html when you do type="password" it hides the password from the development tool in the browser but using jquery the password is showing in plain text
[19:27:02] <Caspan> in the date row if i click the first TD it would add a class
[19:27:04] <quechon> how to hide password or make it imposible to read
[19:27:14] <cannap> you dont need jquery for tue pw field @quechon
[19:27:19] <Caspan> if i selecect the second TD it would remove the class from the first one and add it to the second on
[19:27:39] <taplar> ok, so clicking the date td should activate the row, and deactivate the other rows?
[19:27:40] <Caspan> that way only one TD under the date column could have this class
[19:27:40] <cannap> type="password"
[19:27:44] <shoky_> jquery doesn't make password fields visible
[19:27:52] <Caspan> no
[19:27:54] <cannap> and dont forget the serve
[19:27:59] <shoky_> if you're sending the password via ajax that's fine
[19:28:04] <shoky_> (has nothing to do with jquery though)
[19:28:10] <Caspan> if i have these 5 rows of data and i want to merge them
[19:28:26] <taplar> ok, so just toggle, not remove from others
[19:28:42] <Caspan> so i select one value i want from the date filed, one value from the  cantagory field
[19:28:49] <Caspan> once value from the bill field
[19:29:09] <taplar> one per column
[19:29:15] <Caspan> so on down the columns
[19:29:18] <Caspan> taplar: correct
[19:29:44] <Caspan> then when i am done ill take the values from each TD with this class on it to construct one TR
[19:29:56] <taplar> ok, so what you can try to do is delegate bind click on the table
[19:29:57] <Caspan> merging x amount of rows into 1
[19:30:05] <Caspan> okay
[19:30:06] <taplar> handling for the click of a td
[19:30:10] <cannap> your table is wrong
[19:30:18] <quechon> in the password box password is not visible but when i submit the data and then go to the development tool i can see everythin in plain text
[19:30:23] <taplar> the event.target will have the element that was clicked
[19:30:29] <Caspan> ok
[19:30:31] <taplar> you can check to see which td it is or belongs to
[19:30:52] <taplar> from there, you can get the row and find the position of the td amongst it's siblings
[19:31:08] <taplar> and then use that to know to remove the class from other tds in that same position in the other rows
[19:31:17] <Caspan> okay
[19:31:24] <taplar> if you do not want to mess with positions, you can add classes to your cells
[19:31:36] <Caspan> so each TD will ahve to have its own class
[19:31:42] <taplar> would be less messy
[19:31:47] <quechon> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/nKk4mLZrsKX1zb5xzXWr/
[19:31:53] <Caspan> ther eis no way to know what other TDs are slected in the row if not
[19:32:08] <taplar> you said you didn't care about the row
[19:32:16] <taplar> you were excluding duplicates per column
[19:32:17] <Caspan> sorry column
[19:32:25] <taplar> so yeah, with positions you could
[19:32:27] <shoky_> quechon: passwords are sent in plain text even if you just submit a regular form with no ajax. nothing to do with jquery
[19:32:29] <taplar> but it's mroe steps
[19:32:40] <Caspan> first TD in each column would have to have a class of IE Column-1
[19:32:43] <shoky_> quechon: you should be using TLS (https) and then it will be sent encrypted
[19:33:10] <taplar> $('.column1').not(this).removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active');
[19:33:11] <quechon> for real
[19:33:25] <shoky_> quechon: for real. when you login to ANY SITE you are sending plain-text password
[19:33:26] <Caspan> okay yeah got you
[19:33:27] <quechon> well im using localhost
[19:33:48] <Caspan> I am essentually when clicking removing the selected class from all TDs then appluing it only to the td i just clicked in
[19:33:53] <taplar> yep
[19:34:00] <Caspan> perct
[19:34:03] <Caspan> thank you
[19:34:09] <Caspan> that makes sense
[19:34:46] <taplar> $('.'+ this.className).removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active');
[19:34:50] <taplar> boom, generic for all columns
[19:35:03] <taplar> provided they each have only one class
[19:35:09] <Caspan> that works per column?
[19:35:11] <Caspan> ahh
[19:35:13] <Caspan> okay
[19:35:18] <Caspan> this takes their class
[19:35:20] <Caspan> wow
[19:35:30] <taplar> this.className refers to class="this stuff"
[19:35:54] <Caspan> ahh
[19:38:04] <Caspan> ill try to implement
[19:38:08] <Caspan> i think i get it
[19:38:19] <taplar> getting the concept is 3/4 the battle, :D
[19:44:13] <taplar> i'ma head out for home though.  have a good weekend all
[19:48:27] <Caspan> thanks for all your help
[19:52:30] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/e29cv85h/2/
[19:52:57] <Caspan> okay so i can select each TD now, now i have to beable to remove selected class on any TDs in the same column
[20:03:59] <Caspan> got it!
[20:04:14] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/e29cv85h/3/
[20:04:30] <Caspan> add a class to only one TD per column!!
[21:06:50] <Mavericks> hello $('<span/>').text(participantsList).html()
[21:08:13] <Mavericks> am i correct when i say there's supposed to be a existing span element  and its text is set to the participantslist or some string
[21:08:24] <Mavericks> after which the matching first element is selected with html()
[21:09:42] <Mavericks> this is to display the participants list for a chatroom
[21:13:42] <Mavericks> Some how I can't test that line of code on codepen.io http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JbEWWR
[21:13:45] <Mavericks> any thoughts ?
[21:28:59] <Caspan> document.getElementById('CategoryToChangeToID').innerHTML = $(this).html();
[21:29:23] <Caspan> i have a TD selected but when i click on the TD it does not set the innetHTML of my item
[21:29:32] <unrecited> blah Jquery kills me sometime... I have mimicked this dudees code and its just not giving me the same result but Im incorporating PHP into it (building a time tracker proggy basically) - So I cant really upload to JSfiddle
[21:31:07] <Caspan> i can alert the $(this).html(); and i get the HTML
[21:31:25] <Caspan> but it does not seem to set the innerHTML of the TD i am targeting
[21:32:54] <Caspan> NM got it
[21:33:56] <unrecited> LOL me too
[21:34:00] <unrecited> trial and error
[21:34:09] <Caspan> :)
[21:34:35] <unrecited> SWEAR I spent all night copying the EXACT code of: 'learn ajax with Jquery' tutorial - exact all night.... studied it to a tee - and then I just retyped it saved and all of a suddent it works
[21:38:42] <Caspan> lol
[21:39:33] <Caspan> .html will get me everything inside a selected element, how do i get the element HTML and the inner HTML
[21:43:18] <unrecited> child'
[21:43:29] <unrecited> > or somethind :child maybe?
[21:43:33] <unrecited> im not fluent enough yet
[21:43:33] <systemfault> jQuery doesn't support that AFAIK, you'd have to create a container... clone the selection in it then do .html() on the container.... Or you could probably do: .props('outerHTML') (not sure)
[21:43:53] <systemfault> .prop, sorry not .props
[21:44:45] <Caspan> .get(0)
[21:46:46] <unrecited> aw I got it confused with css didnt OI
[21:46:49] <unrecited> I*
[21:46:55] <systemfault> .get(0) will unwrap your jQuery node.
[21:47:46] <Caspan> systemfault: any other ways i can get the element HTML and inner HTML?
[21:47:56] <Caspan> i want to replicate the selected elements
[21:48:00] <systemfault> I gave you a ton.
[21:48:13] <systemfault> If you want to replicate nodes, you can do .clone
[21:48:24] <Caspan> okay ill look that up
[21:48:44] <systemfault> If you really want the HTML... you can do either: node.prop('outerHTML') or node.get(0).outerHTML
[21:49:12] <systemfault> Believe it or not, browsers don't really work with HTML, they work with nodes.
[21:49:26] <systemfault> So, if you want to copy things, you want to copy nodes.
[21:51:59] <Caspan> systemfault: okay that worked
[21:52:18] <Caspan> now i need to replace another selected element with this element
[21:52:37] <Caspan> im copying one TD and replacing it over another TD
[21:53:15] <systemfault> So select the element and use .replaceWith
[21:53:40] <Caspan> replaceWith
[21:53:41] <Caspan> okay
[21:53:43] <Caspan> thank you
[21:55:05] <Caspan> document.getElementById("test123").replaceWith = $(this).get(0).outerHTML;
[21:55:25] <Caspan> when using it with getElementById  can i still use replaceWith?
[21:55:40] <systemfault> Try to not mix DOM code with jQuery code... it's bad.
[21:55:57] <Caspan> okay i shoudl use jquery to select the ID then
[21:55:59] <systemfault> document.getElementById("test123") is simply $('#test123') with jquery
[21:56:32] <systemfault> And again... stop thinking in terms of HTML.
[21:56:35] <systemfault> It's hurting you.
[21:57:01] <unrecited> yeah $ calls the IDs/Classes whatever you need with Jquery
[21:57:06] <Caspan> i get no error sstill
[21:57:21] <unrecited> Ive got that, my troubles is thinking in programming terms - PHP hardest for me Jquery seems to make most sense which is why I love it
[21:57:36] <Caspan> but when it fires i get no error or the item is nto replaced
[21:57:45] <unrecited> I am now confused on what AJAX truly is as Ive always understood it as async Javascript and XML
[21:57:49] <systemfault> Caspan: What you want is to 1) select the stuff you want to copy...2) copy it using .clone() 3) select the target that is going to be replaced 4) using replaceWith to replace it
[21:57:56] <unrecited> but it seems AJAX in the tutorails Im studying is more - Jquery and PHP
[21:58:06] <systemfault> unrecited: AJAX is a useless word
[21:58:21] <systemfault> unrecited: What you need to know is that JS has a HTTP client
[21:58:30] <systemfault> It's called XMLHttpRequest
[21:59:02] <systemfault> And you can use it to do async http request to servers and fetch data
[21:59:13] <systemfault> It can be XML... JSON.. whatever you can think of.
[21:59:38] <systemfault> jQuery provides $.ajax/$.getJSON/$.post to make it easier to use the XMLHttpRequest
[22:00:21] <systemfault> What you're likely to see in most tutorial is to use $.ajax/$.getJSON/etc to get JSON-encoded data from some server... (Could be a PHP server)
[22:01:33] <unrecited> Im working on JSON now but Im having toubles with UNIX timestamps? Guess thats more a question for PHP channel? Or anyone familiar with it here?
[22:02:34] <systemfault> Sup with unix timestamps?
[22:02:51] <unrecited> well according to www.unixtimestamp.com
[22:02:57] <systemfault> Just use the time() function in PHP
[22:03:07] <unrecited> right but its returning time in I guess UTC time
[22:03:10] <unrecited> I need it to rest EST time
[22:03:27] <unrecited> date is correct but time says its 2:58am and its only 10pm here
[22:03:59] <unrecited> nvm think I found a converter
[22:04:22] <systemfault> So you decided that all your users are going to live in EST?
[22:04:57] <unrecited> well this isnt really for others - this is a personal time tracker Im creating for myself
[22:05:13] <unrecited> so Ide like it to be in my timezone - why would it only be in UTC time anyways
[22:05:13] <systemfault> Ahhh
[22:05:32] <Caspan> systemfault: got it
[22:05:39] <Caspan> i was using = between
[22:06:05] <unrecited> there ya go always the smallest thing you overlook aint it lol
[22:06:20] <Caspan> i was forgetting .replaceWith( what i want to replace with goes in here )
[22:09:11] <systemfault> unrecited: In a real project, UTC is your friend :)
[22:19:39] <shockwave> Hello, I'm trying to implement a chainable API, similar to jQuery's. I was looking at the following code, and I'm confused about the different ways that jQuery declares it's methods: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/init.js
[22:20:03] <shockwave> Actually, it's this URL: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L1
[22:20:53] <shockwave> I see that some methods are added to the jQuery.prototype object, while others are added via jQuery.extend(). Why the different ways of adding methods to jQuery?
[22:24:52] <GeekMonkey> Anyone know where I can find a html5 clone of fruit ninja?
[22:31:23] <arc_> googled 'html5 slice game' http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/2375-wip-jelly-slice/
[23:08:17] <GeekMonkey> http://funhtml5games.com/fruitninja/
[23:08:44] <GeekMonkey> So I am trying to make a version like this ... I actually copied all the code to my server and it is still not working...

[23:35:04] <aristippos> hello. if I grab an elements html, and later modify it, is there a way to get its string? text() doesn't work on it
[23:39:35] <aristippos> never mind.
[23:57:58] <unrecited> gr this killing me! Im using Javascript to reference a PHP $('#log').load('log.php?mode=build');
[23:58:16] <unrecited> but this dude in the tutorial has more as $_GET.. wel shit - guess this is more a PHP question. nvm
