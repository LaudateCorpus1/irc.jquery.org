[02:22:01] <Cork> oh, lovely another password guesser...
[02:32:23] <JavaLover> when using $.getScript how can I check to see if a script had an error loading?
[02:33:43] <JavaLover> oh i think i know the problem now
[02:33:49] <JavaLover> lemem think how to fix this
[04:05:56] <Cork> JavaLover: you have to use jqeury 2.x or 3.x to do that
[04:06:13] <Cork> JavaLover: 1.x doesn't provide it cause older ie doesn't support it
[04:07:32] <JavaLover> oh ic thx Cork
[04:07:38] <JavaLover> but I figured out it's not an error loading the script
[04:07:46] <JavaLover> it's that I had a loop & scripts were loading faster than intended
[04:08:06] <JavaLover> so i'm resolving the issue now but creating a "only when these scripts are done loading, load the final function" function :D
[04:13:42] <JavaLover> okay this works...I guess, I can always make it better but this is fine
[04:19:36] <dantleec1> hi .. i am trying to use jquery-ui via. npm, its trying to call require("jquery")
[04:19:47] <dantleec1> and its saying that "require" is not found
[04:19:54] <dantleec1> i am trying to use it with Semantic UI
[04:20:10] <Cork> dantleec1: you should ask that in a channel related to npm not jqeury
[04:20:36] <dantleec1> Cork: the code is in the jquey-ui package
[04:20:46] <Cork> ya, but the package has nothing to do with jquery
[04:20:52] <dantleec1> oh
[04:20:57] <Cork> require isn't a jquery command
[04:20:59] <Cork> and so on
[04:21:07] <dantleec1> yeah figured that
[04:21:18] <km4> hi
[04:21:23] <Cork> so you have a problem with your package manager not jqeury
[04:21:46] <cannap> datnleec1
[04:21:54] <cannap> do you use webpack or browserify
[04:22:12] <dantleec1> cannap: neither .. i just want to include jquery draggable
[04:22:19] <dantleec1> in the build
[04:22:48] <cannap> you cant require modules on the clientside
[04:22:59] <cannap> without a build tool like webpack or browserify
[04:23:12] <dantleec1> i just want to compile it into a big js file with gulp
[04:23:21] <dantleec1> but tbh i have no idea what best practices are
[04:23:32] <dantleec1> just trying to get something to work
[04:23:38] <dantleec1> nm. will try again tmmrow
[04:24:00] <cannap> you need wbepack or browserify to require modules on client
[04:24:11] <cannap> you can just install the normal way and concat and uglify with gulp
[04:24:22] <dantleec1> cannap: don't want to require it on the client yet
[04:24:36] <dantleec1> but would rather that jquery-ui was installed as a package
[04:24:44] <dantleec1> but maybe i should learn webpack
[04:24:49] <cannap> then link to ../node_modules...
[04:24:52] <cannap> to the dist folder
[04:26:15] <dantleec1> there isn't a dist folder for jquery-ui
[04:26:20] <dantleec1> unless i am missing something
[04:26:52] <dantleec1> (the package jquery-ui on npm)
[04:27:15] <dantleec1> hmm, ok. looks like i somehow installed the wrong package
[04:27:58] <dantleec1> thanks for your help
[05:09:33] <fuchstronaut> so, this is what the netsplit-button does..

[05:15:37] <juslintek> Hi, I can't set ajax response cookie, on CORS domain.
[05:16:03] <juslintek> I'm using header("Set-Cookie: checkout_done=yes; Expires=".date("r",time() + (86400 * 30 * 9999))." GMT; Path=/; Domain=".$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']."; HttpOnly; Secure"); in response.
[05:33:18] <crockstylie> Hello, did someone here used bootstrap table library ?
[05:35:04] <crockstylie> My real question, is I'm trying to run a function inside its onClickCell option function
[05:35:21] <crockstylie> But can't manage it to work :)
[05:43:37] <crockstylie> So I found a way :) there is no problem anymore ;)
[05:43:42] <crockstylie> bye :)
[06:57:22] <_August_> has anyone experienced the math being off on highcharts percentage??
[07:55:48] <codecutter> i have a div with a class name hidden (display:none). When i remove the class i'd like to add animation so that it appears slowly.
[07:57:10] <codecutter> can I chain the animation to this statement? $('.foo).removeClass('hidden')...
[08:08:07] <daslicht> hello world!
[08:11:58] <Cork> codecutter: display isn't animated, use visibility: collapse and height: 0 / height: <fixed number>
[08:12:09] <Cork> codecutter: also note height: auto isn't animatable
[08:19:09] <Cork> ah, ya you can't use hsts with self signed certs
[08:19:23] <Cork> you have to turn it off completely
[08:19:32] <Cork> (or better yet use lets encrypt)
[08:27:40] <Kovensky> annoyingly, let's encrypt needs an externally-accessible address...
[08:30:49] <daslicht> heya Cork
[08:31:18] <Cork> opps wrote that in the wrong channel :D
[08:31:25] <Cork> (wandered where that went XD)
[08:31:29] <Cork> dalbusch1t: o/
[08:33:41] <jose3_> Ahhhh they keep changing the goal
[08:34:23] <jose3_> im quite agile
[08:39:27] <codecutter> Cork: Added a class with visibility: collapse and height: 0. Now I need to show it.
[08:39:57] <Cork> codecutter: visibility: hidden; not collapsed
[08:40:10] <Cork> and when you show it you need to set a height
[08:44:51] <Cork> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/a0q2eLd2/
[09:22:57] <decx> dont animate height tho
[09:45:55] <daslicht> jsfiddle is still buggy with comments
[09:46:17] <daslicht> we get html comments on cmd + /
[09:47:11] <jose3_> I have a question regarding timezones... suppose I have a variable equal to: "Los Angeles", "New York", "Ontario", "Boston" etc. is it possible to get that specific citys timezone based of this variable alone.
[09:47:30] <taplar> maybe something with momentjs
[09:47:33] <taplar> *shrug*
[09:47:44] <jose3_> ok ill check that out
[09:47:49] <jose3_> taplar: thx
[09:50:32] <sillyslux> http://momentjs.com/timezone/
[09:51:06] <taplar> figured they would
[09:51:48] <sillyslux> i see no "Boston" there
[09:52:44] <sillyslux> https://www.google.com/search?q=city+timezone+database&oq=city+timezone+database
[09:56:22] <codecutter> I have an element with alphanumeric text. Need to replace only the numeric values inside element $('foo')
[09:57:42] <sillyslux> codecutter, fiddle?
[09:58:43] <taplar> replace or remove?
[09:58:51] <codecutter> <div class'foo'>There is only 5 words here</div> ... need to replace the 5
[09:59:02] <jose3_> sillyslux: yes I saw this as well, im still trying to figure out how I can make something like this work with smaller cities though
[09:59:10] <codecutter> replace my with say 10
[09:59:19] <taplar> put a span around it, and replace the html() o fit
[09:59:19] <codecutter> replace 5 with say 10*
[09:59:22] <taplar> *of it
[09:59:50] <codecutter> span around the 5?
[09:59:54] <taplar> <div class='foo'>There is only <span class="count">5</span> words here</div>
[10:02:59] <codecutter> tapler: and the jquery?
[10:03:17] <codecutter> you might as well give me the whole thing :)
[10:04:42] <codecutter> nvm
[10:05:17] <sillyslux> jose3_, there also https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/timezone/intro
[10:06:20] <sillyslux> if it's for server-side, you could use this to build your own database and reduce https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/timezone/usage-limits
[10:08:59] <Cork> building your own timezone database is risky though
[10:09:07] <Cork> those change at least a few times a year
[10:09:57] <taplar> DST sux
[10:10:15] <Cork> utc ftw!
[10:11:28] <sillyslux> indeed..
[10:11:34] <codecutter> noticed when I click on the element (click hides the elment), the image at the bottom of the element seems to flicker slighty...
[10:12:00] <codecutter> how can I stop that?
[10:12:47] <codecutter> by flick I mean for a split milisec that background of the image is shown
[10:12:54] <sillyslux> so the best bet for jose3_ would be google-maps timezones only then?
[10:13:15] <jose3_> sillyslux: yeah im looking at this now
[10:13:24] <jose3_> sillyslux: I think this is closer to what I want
[10:13:41] <jose3_> sillyslux: Im just trying to find the easiest way to get the coordinates right now
[10:13:45] <jose3_> sillyslux: Thx!
[10:13:59] <jsownz> codecutter: what are you using to hide the element? hide()? slideUp()?
[10:14:30] <codecutter> this.$node.empty();
[10:14:49] <codecutter> let me try one of those insted
[10:15:10] <codecutter> my statement just remove the clears the containers children
[10:15:19] <codecutter> yikes
[10:15:25] <taplar> yup
[10:15:28] <codecutter> you get what i mean :)
[10:44:25] <codecutter> How do I stop the flicker on append?
[10:52:17] <Cork> codecutter: appending what?
[11:48:22] <Joost> is there a way to animate two elements on the same timer?
[11:48:31] <Joost> i.e. I want to reduce the overhead of starting N timers to animate N divs
[11:48:54] <Joost> there's queue=false, but it's my understanding that this does not make it any more efficient
[11:54:01] <shoky> if you want efficiency.. css transitions/animations
[13:09:03] <dcope> if i have a parent element with a click handler, and a child inside of it with a click handler, how do i prevent the parent's from being fired if the child is clicked?
[13:11:01] <taplar> e.stopPropagation on the child element's handler
[13:11:12] <taplar> e.stopPropagation()
[13:11:58] <dcope> taplar: awesome, thanks :D
[13:25:01] <arc_> i just got off the phone with the people who developed our pos software
[13:25:18] <arc_> i told them that when you go to add a vendor, the tabindex is like address 1 -> phone -> address 2 -> fax -> city
[13:25:34] <arc_> and said i'd appreciate it if they'd change it to go in the expected order
[13:25:55] <arc_> he was like "it's a little more complicated than that on the programming side"
[13:26:01] <arc_> if you say so
[14:25:12] <juzemack> hey all, anyone have experience with coin slider?
[14:38:47] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[14:42:47] <mnbn> .
[15:20:37] <jak2000> how to know wich day number is a certain date?
[15:23:27] <jose3_> lads and laddies- how would I run something like this:
[15:23:27] <jose3_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2055fb235b776fb81742b7d4c723d89d
[15:23:44] <jose3_> how could i listen to multiple fields in the same call?
[15:24:55] <taplar> how could they all be null?
[15:25:25] <jose3_> i mean their values
[15:25:43] <jose3_> no the input itself
[15:25:45] <jose3_> so text
[15:26:03] <taplar> your logic is checking if those elements are null
[15:26:36] <taplar> two things
[15:26:41] <taplar> $() will never be null
[15:27:02] <taplar> and since your processing an event for those elements, one of them will exist
[15:27:09] <taplar> making your current check pointless
[15:28:18] <jose3_> let me think about this some more
[15:28:26] <taplar> sure
[15:29:17] <jose3_> but is this still valid: $('#prompt_first_name', '#prompt_last_name','#prompt_email' ) ?
[15:29:28] <robertmaxrees> that's not doing what you think it is.
[15:29:42] <robertmaxrees> $('#prompt_first_name, #prompt_last_name, #prompt_email' )
[15:30:08] <jose3_> robertmaxrees: Ohhh thanks!
[15:52:06] <jose3_> okay I figured out a semi-working piece of code:
[15:52:06] <jose3_> the only caveat is that it doesn't work if I autofill the form
[15:52:08] <jose3_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3b4384c02ad4dcd8acfef033d62713d8
[15:55:31] <jose3_> i got it with : 'change keypress'
[15:55:38] <jose3_> thanks
[15:55:43] <robertmaxrees> just use input
[15:56:05] <robertmaxrees> or leave it with what you had and abstract that out to a function and call it whenever you modify.
[15:56:09] <robertmaxrees> orrr blah blah blah
[15:56:10] <jose3_> you mean to replace 'change keypress'
[15:58:02] <jose3_> okay i swapped out my code with input
[15:58:12] <jose3_> robertmaxrees: thanks
[16:28:19] <fxmulder> so I have a form with an input text field and a drop down box and the drop down box content depends on the text field needing to make an Ajax call
[16:29:29] <fxmulder> is there a way to allow the user to type in the text box and then click the dropdown and fill the dropdown content based on this series of actions alone?
[16:29:37] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:31:13] <robertmaxrees> though you really only care about the text in the input field.
[16:31:17] <robertmaxrees> not on clicking the dropdown.
[16:31:40] <fxmulder> how so?
[16:31:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:32:29] <robertmaxrees> "is there a way to allow the user to type in the text box and then click the
[16:32:29] <robertmaxrees> dropdown and fill the dropdown content based on this series of actions alone?
[16:33:25] <robertmaxrees> sure - but you said you want to populate the dropdown based on what the user puts in the input field.  no reason to wait until they click on the dropdown to do that.
[16:34:12] <fxmulder> well I need to know when they are done, I don't want to be making a bunch of partial calls that will all fail
[16:34:28] <robertmaxrees> right, so you debounce or wait for the change event.,
[16:35:15] <fxmulder> what is debounce and which change event?
[16:35:19] <robertmaxrees> the change event.
[16:35:34] <robertmaxrees> like, that's the event name :)
[16:41:19] <FastSnail> Hey
[16:41:47] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[16:41:51] * taplar mooooooos
[16:43:26] <taplar> some barnyard humor right there
[16:43:45] <taplar> did they get it?  Nay!
[16:43:53] <robertmaxrees> hay.
[16:43:58] <robertmaxrees> slow down there.
[16:47:18] <taplar> mooving on
[16:47:35] <robertmaxrees> hey, don't have a cow.
[16:48:03] <taplar> it's hard to quit cold turkey
[16:48:20] <robertmaxrees> have you eaten yet?  being peckish can cause that.
[16:49:19] * taplar debates a retort
[16:49:58] <fxmulder> loading the Ajax can take a second or two also depending on the server load
[16:50:07] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[16:50:17] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:50:24] <fxmulder> so clicking right after finishing typing would still open an empty list
[16:50:39] <robertmaxrees> show a loading indicator or something and prevent interaction on the dropdown.
[16:51:08] <fxmulder> but I would have to know when they're done typing to do that
[16:51:12] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:51:15] <robertmaxrees> hence the change event.
[16:51:47] <robertmaxrees> which fires when the input has lost focus and has different contents than the last time that event fired.
[16:54:05] <fxmulder> that works if the action after typing isn't clicking the dropdown but it doesn't work if you click the dropdown
[16:54:13] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't
[16:54:14] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:55:22] <fxmulder> no it drops an empty list before I can put up the loading indicator, if I close and reopen the dropdown it's populated then
[16:56:06] <robertmaxrees> well right, you'll also have to handle that click event on that dropdown as apart of the setup.
[16:56:34] <robertmaxrees> or something along those lines.
[16:57:03] <fxmulder> I don't think I can populate it before it drops an empty list
[16:57:09] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:57:18] <robertmaxrees> right, so you prevent it from dropping the list in the first place.
[16:57:38] <robertmaxrees> like - you're going to have to handle that problem pretty much no matter what.
[16:58:51] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to get creative.
[17:02:24] <fxmulder> Yeah that makes sense, will have to dig into how to do that
[17:02:33] <taplar> on focus, disable the drop down possibly
[17:28:51] <fxmulder> so if the drop down is disabled, no mouse events seem to fire when I click on it
[17:29:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'll probably have to get weird with event handlers.
[17:32:45] <taplar> re-enable it once you start building it
[17:33:00] <robertmaxrees> if it's open you can't modify it iirc.
[17:33:07] <robertmaxrees> the changes aren't reflected.
[17:33:18] <taplar> wouldn't open if it's disabled
[17:33:43] <robertmaxrees> but then the change even never fires.
[17:33:44] <taplar> if we're talking about a plain old <select>
[17:33:51] <robertmaxrees> because focus is never lost from the input.
[17:33:58] <taplar> hmm
[17:34:27] <taplar> yeah that'd be funky
[17:42:37] <taplar> is hiding it an option?
[17:48:24] <fxmulder> alright so I'm catching the drop request without dropping and then loading the select content and recognizing if the select was clicked or not, need to figure out how to drop the select now without clicking it again
[17:49:07] <taplar> you mean make the select expand?
[17:49:30] <taplar> iirc, javascript can't do that
[17:49:54] <fxmulder> well that's unfortunate
[17:50:15] <fxmulder> that pretty much defeats what I need to do
[17:50:15] <taplar> if you need that you should look at something like jqui selectable
[17:50:44] <taplar> err, no selectable
[17:50:55] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/
[17:50:58] <robertmaxrees> you want to populate a dropdown before it opens.
[17:55:20] <taplar> jasmine is going to be the death of me i think
[17:58:57] <jak2000> hi all
[17:59:08] <taplar> wb jak
[17:59:34] <jak2000> http://pastebin.com/0yFzSvY4   <--- i think not use correctly .when.apply lines 96 and 112...
[17:59:45] <jak2000> hey taplar!
[18:00:56] <jak2000> see line 15 and 16: var wfecha = $("#wfecha_1_" + wyi).val();     the value of: #wfecha_1_6  =  '2016/06/25' #wfecha_1_7  = '2016/06/26' #wfecha_1_8  = '2016/06/27' #wfecha_1_9  = '2016/06/28'  (and so on....)...
[18:00:58] <taplar> looks right syntatically
[18:01:41] <robertmaxrees> so what happens now jak2000?
[18:01:45] <robertmaxrees> or doesn't happen?
[18:02:03] <jak2000> when ajax is called line 45, save data into a DB.... but first save: '2016/06/27' and then '2016/06/28'  and then '2016/06/25' why?
[18:02:15] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:02:16] <jak2000> not ordered the data, whyyy?
[18:02:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost.
[18:02:21] <jak2000> ok
[18:02:25] <robertmaxrees> oh, because ajax calls can happen out of order.
[18:02:26] <jak2000> try explain again
[18:02:36] <robertmaxrees> can't rely on when they'll finish
[18:03:22] <jak2000> but i am expected, save in the DB first the: '2016/06/25' and then '2016/06/26' and then: '2016/06/27' ....
[18:03:39] <robertmaxrees> why does the order matter?
[18:03:44] <jak2000> how to do that?
[18:03:45] <taplar> careful of variable scope.  i already see one variable that doesn't have a var
[18:03:59] <jak2000> taplar wich line
[18:04:07] <taplar> 18
[18:04:34] <taplar> just glancing, scope could lead you to using unintended values in your ajax calls
[18:04:35] <jak2000> fixed
[18:04:55] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 is it server-side or client-side you're having problems with?
[18:05:47] <jak2000> robert: because see: line 68.... ajax call... when the Detail data was saved, wfecha have always same value: '2016/06/28'
[18:05:52] <jak2000> not understand why
[18:05:55] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:05:55] <taplar> ln 57 widMaster is being changed by the done(s)
[18:06:02] <robertmaxrees> so is the issue client side or server side?
[18:06:25] <jak2000> yew but why wfecha always have same value?
[18:06:33] <jak2000> i think is client side problem
[18:06:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:06:46] <robertmaxrees> i give up
[18:06:59] <jak2000> ajax problem....
[18:07:11] <robertmaxrees> right, but where are you seeing the out of order problem?
[18:07:21] <robertmaxrees> you said things are entering into your DB in the wrong order, right?>
[18:08:34] <jak2000> but because
[18:08:37] <jak2000> ajax not wait a result
[18:09:05] <robertmaxrees> errr, are you expecing the client-side to wait to do each request until the previous one has finished?
[18:09:26] <jak2000> yes
[18:09:34] <robertmaxrees> then you need to rewrite this entirely.
[18:09:51] <jak2000> why?
[18:09:57] <jak2000> need learn something?
[18:10:01] <robertmaxrees> because you want to make synchronous async calls.
[18:10:04] <taplar> when() doesn't make it wait
[18:10:07] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:10:13] <taplar> it just waits until they all finish
[18:10:19] <robertmaxrees> but to ask again:
[18:10:20] <jak2000> mmmm
[18:10:21] <jak2000> :(
[18:10:29] <robertmaxrees> why does it matter the order they get entered in?
[18:12:31] <jak2000> no problem or is irrelevant the order entered
[18:12:38] <robertmaxrees> then why do you care?
[18:12:41] <jak2000> but i lost some link betwen master and detail
[18:12:44] <jak2000> data
[18:12:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:12:57] <jak2000> ok
[18:13:05] <robertmaxrees> the .then()/.done() callbacks will give you what you need - the args passed are in order.
[18:13:08] <robertmaxrees> so it shouldn't matter.
[18:13:21] <jak2000> ok.
[18:13:24] <jak2000> understand
[18:13:48] <jak2000> mmmm but... i lost.. this:
[18:15:09] * taplar waits in suspense
[18:15:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:17:37] <jak2000> https://postimg.org/image/79zzuhogn/
[18:17:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:18:03] * taplar continues waiting
[18:18:16] <robertmaxrees> oh.  toss back an id or something with the response to tie it back to those rows if you need.
[18:18:25] <jak2000> i am interested in: the dates columns... and in the names.... need not lose the link...
[18:18:38] <robertmaxrees> you're relying on something ephemeral for that link.
[18:18:56] <robertmaxrees> toss back an id or something to link the two together.
[18:19:04] <jak2000> in the data... i want save the first day, 25, and the data detail...
[18:19:14] <robertmaxrees> i gathered as much.
[18:19:59] <jak2000> if the ajax start saving the data(isnerting data) in the db first the day 28, and in the detail ajax call back, save first, the day 25 i lose the link Data, understand me?
[18:20:21] <robertmaxrees> because you're relying on something ephemeral like order to dictate that.
[18:20:28] <robertmaxrees> you need to find something else to link those two things together.
[18:23:17] <taplar> trying to comprehend this.  are you doing an ajax request per row?
[18:23:26] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:23:39] <taplar> and not additional ones per column of the row i hope?
[18:23:48] <robertmaxrees> he's got three rows - he expects that the first completed request is for the first row.
[18:24:18] <jak2000> see:
[18:24:54] <robertmaxrees> d, e, f, g
[18:25:13] <taplar> i'm having trouble seeing where he's grabbing the Lun-Sab fields for the ajax call
[18:25:34] <jak2000> i expect this: positioning in column 6, then start rerun the ROWS, 1,2,3 next, positioning in next column: 7 and so on....
[18:25:49] <jak2000> taplar, see this html code:
[18:25:52] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:26:00] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/qbc97vu9/
[18:26:00] <robertmaxrees> right, your problem is you're making a broken assumption.
[18:26:33] <taplar> wait, so you are making an ajax call per column/row combination
[18:27:05] <taplar> is this correct?
[18:28:33] <taplar> ln 15 for each column and sub loop ln 59 for each row
[18:28:52] <robertmaxrees> woahj
[18:28:55] <robertmaxrees> *woah.  no way.
[18:28:58] <taplar> ;)
[18:29:24] <robertmaxrees> let me guess, you're trying to save every time every field changes.
[18:29:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah?
[18:30:51] <jak2000> taplar, robert, yes----> <taplar> wait, so you are making an ajax call per column/row combination
[18:31:04] <taplar> you should rethink that
[18:31:14] <jak2000> robert, at the bottom i have a button named: save ...
[18:31:27] <taplar> the most granular i would go would be to do an ajax call per row, giving it all the field data
[18:31:38] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:32:43] <jak2000> understand taplpar
[18:32:59] <jak2000> taplar...
[18:33:07] <jak2000> i rethink.... the things:
[18:33:21] <jak2000> put in hidden fields in each CELL, the values, MASTER and detail....
[18:33:27] <jak2000> and easy fix the problem? not?
[18:33:37] <taplar> why do you need hidden fields?
[18:33:53] <taplar> you already got your inputs for each of the table cells
[18:34:24] <jak2000> hiden inputs.. for save some data sample: Id's
[18:34:30] <taplar> oh sure
[18:34:51] <taplar> though if your doing it with ajax, you could use data attributes
[18:35:03] <taplar> less typing
[18:35:13] <jak2000> data- ?
[18:35:27] <taplar> <somefield data-id="myId"></somefield>
[18:36:05] <taplar> <tr> would be a prime canidate if your using a true table
[18:40:42] <jak2000> i not know how to send an array of inputs as a parameter to JSP :)
[18:41:05] <taplar> you'd just send an ajax per row.  select the tr's, loop on them, make a request per
[18:41:22] <taplar> if that's what your confused about
[18:41:51] <robertmaxrees> or .map() 'em
[18:42:01] <robertmaxrees> why not send everything in one big ajax request?
[18:42:06] <taplar> ^
[18:42:16] <taplar> or let it do a normal submit
[18:42:24] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing to render, even, since all data is already client-side.
[18:43:33] <taplar> assuming this data cannot be changed by other users
[18:44:05] <taplar> if other users can add more rows, you'd kinda want to redraw
[18:44:37] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:44:46] <jak2000> the user can modify the 8.0 to 4.0 or other value but not add more rows or columns
[18:44:56] <robertmaxrees> which user?
[18:45:02] <robertmaxrees> the current user?
[18:45:11] <taplar> can *any* user add more?
[18:45:18] <robertmaxrees> or change other data?
[18:45:36] <jak2000> yes the current user
[18:45:40] <jak2000> the user signed...
[18:45:58] <robertmaxrees> but no other users?
[18:46:11] <robertmaxrees> like, multiple people wouldn't be editing this at the same time, right?
[18:48:14] <taplar> heh, i don't speak spanish but the more i look at this it makes me think of a time sheet or something
[18:49:58] <taplar> woah, Lun in vietnamese is 'dwarf'
[18:51:16] <jak2000> no only 1 user
[18:51:33] <jak2000> Lun=Lunes=Monday
[18:52:00] <taplar> so that makes me beg the question.  if no one can edit those other fields, and this user cant.  why have them?
[18:52:20] <robertmaxrees> fun fact: "beg the question" is a logical fallacy
[18:52:28] <taplar> oh?
[18:53:08] <robertmaxrees> you're already making a conclusion - it's circular reasoning.
[18:53:58] <robertmaxrees> most people mean "assuming x, why not y?"
[18:54:12] <jak2000> thanks friends....
[18:54:18] <jak2000> for your comments?
[18:54:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:55:34] <jak2000> :* for yours.
[18:55:46] <taplar> so your saying something like, 'if you cant have it, why have it' is circular reasoning?
[18:55:54] <taplar> ah, i think i c
[18:55:58] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[18:56:04] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[18:56:21] <robertmaxrees> you're basically asking a question when you've already made a conclusion about the answer.
[18:56:55] <robertmaxrees> and/or what the question itself should be.
[19:00:01] <taplar> so he made a statement, which lead me to assume that something was true, but by assuming it was true it's making me ask if it's true.  but if i assume it's true, there is no point in asking if it is true. ?
[19:01:10] <robertmaxrees> "Begging the Question is a fallacy in which the premises include the claim that the conclusion is true or (directly or indirectly) assume that the conclusion is true."
[19:01:23] <robertmaxrees> you're basically assuming the outcome - you're not actually asking a question.
[19:01:29] <DonRichie> Hi, I can watch a video training to jquery which was released in 2010. Is this still up to date enough for learning the basics?
[19:01:55] <robertmaxrees> that's going to have quite a bit of outdated info, DonRichie
[19:01:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/ instead.
[19:03:23] <FastSnail> is there a better way to write this? http://pastebin.com/JmZcBi0H
[19:03:34] <taplar> ah.  i guess i don't use it in that fashion.  'beg the question' to me more means, you've said something that I either find ridiculous or has a glaring logic flaw or something, so I feel compelled to ask the question to see if not only my conclusion is accurate but my perception of the constraints that lead me to that conclusion
[19:03:43] <DonRichie> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the advice. Looks very good. Do you know if there are there some parts not covered I should keep in mind to look up seperately?
[19:03:55] <robertmaxrees> DonRichie nothing that you want to tackle yet.
[19:03:57] <robertmaxrees> start with the basics ;)
[19:04:17] <taplar> FastSnail: what part are you concerned about?
[19:04:50] <robertmaxrees> FastSnail ('#collapse-payment-address select[name=\'country_id\']').trigger('change'); - i'd abstract things and call whatever function this is trying to run explicitly instead.
[19:05:21] <DonRichie> robertmaxrees: I already did some stuff with Jquery, but now need to learn it university grade. So my focus is on catching all important information I can get :P. I did a JavaScript Tutorial before. So I think I can skip the "what is dom" part
[19:05:26] <robertmaxrees> also give things classes and select on those instead.  and store $("#collapse-payment-address") in a var and use .find() off of it.
[19:05:49] <robertmaxrees> DonRichie *jQuery.  and do the learning center.  otherwise lots of other stuff won't make sense.
[19:05:50] <audio> FastSnail: looks like line 5 and 10 are identical
[19:06:22] <robertmaxrees> DonRichie also, "university grade"?  what do you mean by that?
[19:06:48] <taplar> do universities teach jquery now?
[19:07:07] <DonRichie> robertmaxrees: I am participating at a Web-Engineering course. I would say yes.
[19:07:10] <robertmaxrees> that's part of why i'm confused.  i'm assuming he means for a web dev course.
[19:07:22] <robertmaxrees> Yep.
[19:07:27] <robertmaxrees> So start with the learning center.
[19:07:33] <robertmaxrees> it'll have a lot of really solid information.
[19:07:47] <robertmaxrees> and don't skip stuff.
[19:07:54] <robertmaxrees> they may cover things you don't already know.
[19:07:56] <FastSnail> <very new to js/jquery :) It works, I'm probably just doing it the wrong way :P
[19:08:00] <DonRichie> robertmaxrees: Usual University. But my Professor is crazy. He is trying out some kind of online learning and gives us deprecated videos
[19:08:25] <robertmaxrees> DonRichie sadly, that may be a function of a deal the university has with the publisher.  in your case, watch the video.
[19:08:30] <DonRichie> robertmaxrees: Okay thanks, will read the source you gave me
[19:08:32] <robertmaxrees> they may require you to use a version of jquery
[19:08:47] <robertmaxrees> and that version may not have features/may do things differently than what the learning center covers.
[19:08:58] <robertmaxrees> so when it comes time to do whatever, you might be SOL.
[19:09:34] <robertmaxrees> 2010
[19:09:45] <robertmaxrees> that was jq 1.4ish
[19:10:19] <robertmaxrees> so the learning center will be way off from what existed at the time.
[19:11:57] <taplar> heh, this whole convo makes me think of the time that one person came in here asking if anyone would be interested in writing some tutorials for some online training site.
[19:11:58] <DonRichie> robertmaxrees: Nobody knows what this guy will ask at the test. The exercises are asking about how to use selectors. I think it would not harm if I learn the up to date information
[19:12:08] <robertmaxrees> DonRichie it actually might.
[19:12:17] <robertmaxrees> DonRichie because he may assume methods and things used back in 2010
[19:12:34] <robertmaxrees> in short: don't use the footgun.
[19:12:39] <robertmaxrees> go with what he provided.
[19:13:31] <DonRichie> robertmaxrees: hmmm :\ , will sleep over it
[19:13:35] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[19:13:36] <DonRichie> Thanks for your advice
[19:13:45] <taplar> though do still look at the learning center.  after school in the real world, you'll want the up to date stuff
[19:13:55] <robertmaxrees> eeehhh
[19:13:59] <taplar> no?
[19:14:00] <robertmaxrees> that's going to confuse him i think.
[19:14:05] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:14:11] <robertmaxrees> after you're done with the course, sure.
[19:14:22] <taplar> i can see that
[19:14:28] <robertmaxrees> but avoid it until then.  otherwise you'll have to remember "Wait was this method available in 1.4?"
[19:15:02] <DonRichie> robertmaxrees: I feel a little uncomfortable thinking of learning deprecated stuff.
[19:15:16] <taplar> feel comfortable getting an 'A'
[19:15:17] <robertmaxrees> eh.  a lot of the basics will still apply when you get out.
[19:15:19] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[19:15:23] <robertmaxrees> focus on passing first.
[19:15:34] <robertmaxrees> fwiw, not every place you with will use an up to date version of JQ anyway.
[19:15:42] <robertmaxrees> lots of places are using ancient versions still.
[19:16:07] <robertmaxrees> so worry less about that.  the basics are far more important.  also: it's college.  if you think the point is just to learn practical knowledge, you're missing half the point :)
[19:19:01] <taplar> i know i had to learn a bunch of 'crap' not related to IT when I went, but it's all cumulative and I find it seeping in here and there. nothing wrong with being more rounded.
[19:19:28] <taplar> except for history.  fk history
[19:20:10] <taplar> just like alexander bell said.
[19:20:17] <taplar> what did he say?  i dunno
[19:20:22] <taplar> why?  fk history
[19:22:33] <robertmaxrees> not even really about rounded knowledge.
[19:22:38] <robertmaxrees> i mean, that's kind of a part of it.
[19:22:55] <Trioxin> why does this keep returning undefined? $("tspan" )[ 1 ].text;
[19:23:05] <taplar> text isn't an Element property
[19:23:10] <taplar> innerHTML
[19:23:18] <robertmaxrees> also: svg
[19:23:19] <taplar> or $().text()
[19:23:28] <Trioxin> k thx
[19:23:48] <taplar> tspan an svg thing?
[19:23:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:23:57] <robertmaxrees> and jquery + svg = :(
[19:24:37] <robertmaxrees> and college involves you doing things you kind of don't want to do without any super major ramifications (save for some stuff) - it's a safe place to learn how to function in society.  some people need that.
[19:25:11] <taplar> the extraction from the bubble
[19:25:23] <taplar> provided your college isn't in your home town
[19:25:28] <robertmaxrees> nah even then.
[19:25:52] <robertmaxrees> because you have to do things and deal with the consequences, but it's a little safer to fail than the "real world"
[19:26:27] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of like when little kids play - a big reason it's so critically important is because it helps kids learn basic social interaction.  hitting somebody hurts - and they might hit you back.
[19:30:10] <taplar> time to go do some social interactions on the highway.  :).  later
[19:30:14] <robertmaxrees> haha
[19:31:00] <Trioxin> problem: I'm inputing this text into a field that updates a list after you type into it via: $('#minlms').val(90); but doing it programmatically like this doesn't trigger the change in the table. Only if I actually type a value into the input field.
[19:31:27] <robertmaxrees> solution: abstract out the hanlder and call it when you do the programmatic change :)
[19:31:50] <Trioxin> there's that but I was wondering if there was just a simpler way
[19:32:00] <robertmaxrees> that's much clearer.
[19:32:04] <ABM_Dan> Say I have a series of forms, in which I have some checkboxes who, based on their status, enable/disable, hide/show some portions of the page, coding this is pretty trivial if I do it page by page, case by case. Is there a way to abstract this so I can have it happen through html attributes? (class names, data-*, etc)
[19:32:08] <robertmaxrees> don't use the document to proxy logic :)
[19:32:23] <ABM_Dan> I mean I know it's possible, but whatever I tried ended up looking rather ugly.
[19:32:33] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan sure.  there are a few ways.
[19:32:58] <robertmaxrees> data-controls="someClass"
[19:33:00] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[19:33:40] <Trioxin> is there some way I can use the dom inspector to see what script handles the onchange or whatever event of this input field?
[19:33:56] <ABM_Dan> ok, how would you mark up a generic checkbox, that when clicked, told a few field to gain the class disabled, and copy their value from some other fields?
[19:34:01] <robertmaxrees> sure - there's an event handlers tab, Trioxin
[19:34:15] <Trioxin> robertmaxrees, yeah but I don't see anything in it
[19:34:24] <ABM_Dan> Without having constant selectors in the js, obviously.
[19:34:27] <robertmaxrees> Trioxin maybe it's a delegated listener.
[19:34:43] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan <input type="checkbox" data-controls="someClass">
[19:35:07] <robertmaxrees> you could then specify particular behaviors for given classes.
[19:36:10] <ABM_Dan> allright, I have my input ready, when I click it, it's ready to disable and copy. But it has no idea WHAT to disable and copy.
[19:36:17] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:36:19] <robertmaxrees> data-controls
[19:36:21] <robertmaxrees> that's what that does.
[19:40:44] <ABM_Dan> https://jsfiddle.net/ugbur0bw/
[19:40:59] <robertmaxrees> use .prop() btw.
[19:41:13] <ABM_Dan> https://jsfiddle.net/ugbur0bw/1/
[19:41:43] <robertmaxrees> .prop('disabled', true); and basically.
[19:42:19] <robertmaxrees> except you'd give the copy-and-lock class to whatever inputs you want to control.
[19:42:41] <ABM_Dan> so, #two?
[19:42:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:43:11] <ABM_Dan> ideally the checkbox should copy #one's val into #two and disable #two
[19:43:45] <robertmaxrees> ah.  that explains things better.
[19:44:13] <ABM_Dan> it's the classic situation in which you have like billing address and shipping address, for instance.
[19:44:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:44:31] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't say "classic", but sure.
[19:44:44] <ABM_Dan> how is that not something that happens in a million sites.
[19:44:49] <ABM_Dan> doesn't matter.
[19:44:57] <robertmaxrees> plenty of place copy the data and let the user edit it still.
[19:45:09] <robertmaxrees> but what would i know about billing forms on sites.
[19:45:42] <robertmaxrees> so really it sounds like you have multiple forms to contend with here.  i might use that to your advantage.
[19:47:02] <ABM_Dan> I do have several forms and several behaviors.
[19:47:13] <robertmaxrees> then base it off of that.
[19:47:20] <ABM_Dan> For some reason our ux designer sometimes wants us to copy the value and then lock it
[19:47:23] <robertmaxrees> you can use the name attribute to your advantage here.
[19:47:26] <robertmaxrees> that's weird.
[19:47:29] <robertmaxrees> but fair enough.
[19:47:35] <ABM_Dan> and in some other places, hide the copied over fields
[19:47:44] <robertmaxrees> Interesting.
[19:47:59] <ABM_Dan> So basically, in order not to go insane, I ended up doing stuff like
[19:48:45] <ABM_Dan> input type="checkbox" data-action="copy|hide|disable|etc" data-target="comma-separated-list-of-ids"
[19:48:49] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[19:49:11] <ABM_Dan> and each field that had to be copied over, had data-copy-source="id-of-source-field"
[19:49:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, heh, i personally do everything I can to avoid having any logic specific in my markup.
[19:49:30] <robertmaxrees> but you could do this on a form level and filter/etc based on input names.
[19:50:00] <ABM_Dan> Those tend to be pretty rigid, due to backend features.
[19:50:11] <robertmaxrees> but are they consistent?
[19:50:25] <robertmaxrees> ie always a name="firstname" name="lastname" etc?
[19:50:26] <ABM_Dan> They are consistent, but parsing them would be tedious.
[19:50:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd disagree.
[19:50:39] <robertmaxrees> but meh. you and i rarely see eye to eye soooo.
[19:50:39] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:50:48] <ABM_Dan> like sometimes it's billing_firstname
[19:51:10] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you'd need a mapping of which fields map to which other fields.
[19:51:36] <ABM_Dan> or, actually the naming is like formname[inputgroupname][subgroupname][inputname]
[19:52:01] <ABM_Dan> like name="billing[userData][billing][firstname]"
[19:52:16] <ABM_Dan> yeah, mapping is an approach I tried.
[19:52:16] <robertmaxrees> sure, but are those consistent between all instances of billing forms?
[19:52:27] <robertmaxrees> that's what i would go with here, but (shrug)
[19:52:47] <ABM_Dan> uhm, not entirely, the last [] portion is, the rest might change, drastically at times even.
[19:53:05] <robertmaxrees> so you could have a billing form that doesn't use name="billing[userData][billing][firstname]" ?
[19:53:13] <ABM_Dan> yeah
[19:53:14] <robertmaxrees> O.o that's pretty scary.
[19:53:28] <ABM_Dan> it could be otherTypeOfBilling[billing][firstname]
[19:53:42] <ABM_Dan> skipping userData, because it doesn't need grouping in that billing form.
[19:53:45] <robertmaxrees> there's more than one type of billing?
[19:53:51] <ABM_Dan> Yeah.
[19:54:17] <ABM_Dan> security deposits vs paying for a product vs asking for a refund (reverse billing!)
[19:54:47] <robertmaxrees> heh, those are all very similar to me.  i'd change my backend at that point, but i could see why you wouldn't want to scope creep that.,
[19:55:27] <ABM_Dan> Anyway, I have to go.
[19:55:35] <ABM_Dan> Guess I will try to address that tomorrow.
[19:55:48] <ABM_Dan> In the meanwhile I'll enjoy what the other dev did: <input id="use-prof-address" data-target="#accessibility_wrap" data-trigger="change" data-toggler="class" data-class="disabled" type="checkbox" hidden="hidden" class="copy-contact-check"/>
[19:55:59] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahahahaha
[19:56:01] <ABM_Dan> (this is what I am trying to avoid)
[19:56:01] <robertmaxrees> wowzer.
[19:56:27] <kg> Hey guys, anyone got a solution for this? https://jsfiddle.net/ehesdtaf/
[19:57:34] <robertmaxrees> kg wrong palce to ask.
[19:57:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd check a freelance channel maybe.
[19:58:10] <robertmaxrees> kg unless you'd like us to help you figure it out.
[19:58:37] <kg> yes, any hint or solution is appreciated
[19:58:42] <robertmaxrees> also - you can't repeat IDs on a page.
[19:58:50] <robertmaxrees> so your needsactive id is no bueno.
[19:58:59] <kg> robertmaxrees: IDs are only for showing purposes
[19:59:05] <robertmaxrees> still invalid.
[19:59:08] <kg> I know.
[19:59:14] <robertmaxrees> ... then don't use 'em :)
[19:59:28] <robertmaxrees> either way, you can use .parents() here.
[19:59:56] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/parentsUntil/ prime candidate for this.
[19:59:58] <kg> if ($('.hasSubnav').children('a.active')) {$('.hasSubnav a.active').closest('.hasSubnav').addClass('active');}
[20:00:03] <kg> This is my current solution
[20:00:08] <robertmaxrees> nah.  flip the idea.
[20:00:11] <kg> But it doesn't work with every level
[20:00:13] <robertmaxrees> start with the active element ang up up.
[20:00:16] <robertmaxrees> *and go up
[20:01:47] <Darren_> http://darrenbachan.com/playground/chase-and-kayla/index.html http://scrollmagic.io/examples/advanced/parallax_sections.html I have my example and the source of the code I was following, I have no idea why this scrollmagic thing won't work for me to do parallax dividers
[20:01:51] <ABM_Dan> $('.active').parentsUntil('.nav_table_wrap', '.hasSubnav, .leaf, .nav_table').addClass('tag');
[20:02:05] <ABM_Dan> but your requirements don't match with your markup.
[20:02:07] <ABM_Dan> Bye.
[20:02:08] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan let him figure it out :)
[20:02:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:02:40] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ any errors in your console or anything like that?
[20:03:24] <Darren_> robertmaxrees damn, you're right, I don't know why I always forget to check that
[20:05:31] <Darren_> I see the console errors but I'm not sure how to fix them, I'll do some more research
[20:05:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:09:28] <Darren_> http://scrollmagic.io/docs/framework.jQuery.html is it possible someone could help me decipher this or point me in the right direction?
[20:23:14] <SlizardWizard> much better
[20:23:22] <SlizardWizard> Think i was stuck in a netsplit or something
[20:24:32] <SlizardWizard> $(this).children('div').not('.StagePanel') so i have this line, it works perfectly fine and returns all the divs i want, I want to select the inputs in those divs though
[20:25:06] <SlizardWizard> If i add .find('input') after it though it doesn't any elements
[20:25:29] <SlizardWizard> if i use the first line it returns the rights Divs which do contain the inputs
[21:30:35] <Darren_> anyone know how to remove that grey background images have when being lazy loaded?
[21:59:00] <furoido> $(this).text().replace("Lif3", "Lif3\n\n"); how do I make the replacement text bold?
[22:48:01] <earational> hey
[22:48:05] <earational> clearall
