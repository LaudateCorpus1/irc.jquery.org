[09:36:21] <holdmypocket> Can someone help me out with a single page nav issue? http://dev.webprojectview.com/heartland/nutrition-technology/
[09:36:38] <holdmypocket> if you click on one of the sub navigation links it takes you to the anchor and adds the active class to the corresponding sub nav item
[09:36:47] <holdmypocket> but if you just scroll down the page it doesn't apply the active class at all
[09:37:09] <holdmypocket> my js is in main.js and i'm using the jquery.nav.js plugin
[09:39:26] <taplar> this guy? https://github.com/davist11/jQuery-One-Page-Nav
[09:39:39] <holdmypocket> yeah that's the one
[09:42:32] <taplar> your missing the 'current' class on your lis
[09:42:43] <taplar> you would probably put it by default on the overview li
[09:43:10] <taplar> notice on that git's "sample markup"
[09:43:47] <holdmypocket> so for this site i used 'active' so i need to add 'active' to overview initially
[09:44:17] <taplar> ah
[09:44:44] <taplar> you may have to change the 'currentClass' option in the initialization to be active as well then
[09:45:33] <holdmypocket> yeah, I got that in my main.js.. with that said.. i've just noticed that locally the scrolling works.. on that dev site it doesn't.. i have some investigating to do
[09:45:47] <holdmypocket> actually
[09:45:53] <holdmypocket> it's intermittent now.. even on that dev site
[09:46:15] <holdmypocket> so it breaks if you click a sub nav item, and THEN scroll
[09:46:20] <holdmypocket> but if you scroll from the begining it works just fine
[09:46:29] <taplar> what do you use 'active' for?
[09:46:38] <holdmypocket> active applies that border-bottom
[09:47:11] <taplar> ah
[09:59:25] <burzum2> hi
[09:59:40] <taplar> aloha
[10:00:38] <burzum2> https://plnkr.co/edit/KbACQBlk7ugDTnw6lf3s im trying to write a small jquery plugin/method that is showing the errors from my api in the view but i dont understand why im getting the exception and its now showing the first <div> either
[10:02:04] <burzum2> meh i think i need to use each()
[10:06:47] <shoky> burzum2: you also need the elements to exist when you're running that :) include your script at the end of <body>  or use  $(document).ready(..)
[10:10:58] <taplar> plunker!  haven't seen this one before
[10:13:57] <taplar> you probably also want to check at the start of your plugin that this.length > 0
[10:14:14] <shoky> no need,  just do:   return this.each(...);
[10:14:28] <taplar> true
[10:16:06] <taplar> could even filter on the expected data attribute to avoid the throwable
[10:22:11] <burzum2> shoky yes, ive already noticed that and changed it
[10:22:34] <burzum2> taplar i want the exception in this case, just didnt understood why it came up, but then i realized i need the each
[10:22:56] <burzum2> https://plnkr.co/edit/KbACQBlk7ugDTnw6lf3s?p=preview my problem is now that for whatever reason its not finding the error objects value
[10:24:07] <shoky> burzum2: your error field is "zip" but you have "plz" in your html.  and for the addresses one you can't do it like that, the key has to match exactly
[10:24:35] <shoky> burzum2: also you can't do  errors.field,  must be errors[field]
[10:24:48] <shoky> errors.field checks if it has a "fields" property
[10:24:56] <shoky> "field"
[10:24:57] <burzum2> shoky how do i match the key correctly? guess the problem is the array with the [0]?
[10:25:08] <shoky> burzum2: they have to be equal.
[10:26:05] <shoky> burzum2: https://plnkr.co/edit/q0uP6CiKxGgYUfAWmCFO?p=preview
[10:26:37] <burzum2> shoky i cant change the error array from the API
[10:26:50] <burzum2> well I could but this would change a lot more
[10:27:10] <burzum2> is there no way to dynamically access that data in js?
[10:27:16] <shoky> burzum2: then you'll have to parse that string with the [0]  and dig into the errors object...
[10:27:40] <shoky> there are probably libraries that can do it for you, donno
[10:28:27] <burzum2> crap i wanted to avoid that, thank you!
[10:42:39] <lenswipe> hey guys
[10:42:50] <lenswipe> looking for a jquery plugin for something- wondered if you could help me out?
[10:44:32] <decx> can confirm there are jquery plugins for things
[10:45:30] <lost123> hi i cannot make my slideshow run http://tinyurl.com/jbe2ebm i have jquery included plus the responsiveslides js too
[10:45:56] <decx> apparently not
[10:46:18] <lost123> i get this error responsiveSlides is not a function although the script includes which defines this function is there.
[10:51:03] <decx> look at your sorce
[10:51:05] <decx> source
[10:51:18] <decx> you include the responsive thing which requires before jquery
[10:51:29] <decx> also you use an incredibly outdated version
[10:51:33] <lost123> i have now moved it below jquery and will see
[10:51:44] <lost123> both are outdated and used to work. Suddenly stopped working.
[10:57:55] <burzum2> shoky i solved it using the function from that answer :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6491463/accessing-nested-javascript-objects-with-string-key
[11:12:35] <shoky> sweet
[11:12:37] <decx> an object selector how weird
[12:05:08] <Ice_Strike> <tr data-status-id="123"> .. </tr> What is right approch to find data-status-id with 123?
[12:05:24] <Ice_Strike> do I have to loop through tr?
[12:05:55] <Ice_Strike> or should I go with: <tr id="status_id_123">
[12:06:51] <taplar_> $('tr').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('status-id') === 123; })
[12:07:48] <Ice_Strike> taplar_ Hmm
[12:08:24] <Ice_Strike> taplar_ Might be better to do <tr id="status_id_123">
[12:08:27] <Ice_Strike> code will be shorter.
[12:09:03] <taplar> *shrug* shoving more logic into your ids, :P
[12:09:29] <Ice_Strike> How would you do it? :)
[12:09:36] <taplar> like i listed above
[12:10:16] <taplar> get em and filter.  getElementsByTag isn't slow, and data-* fields are intended for keeping extra data for an element
[12:11:55] <Ice_Strike> Yea true
[12:12:05] <Ice_Strike> $("#status_id" + id)..
[12:15:14] <taplar> robertmaxrees: yo, did you april fools me?
[12:15:46] <robertmaxrees> heh, nah.  forgot to mention that it'll be to like half of our tablet and mobile users first.
[12:15:47] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[12:18:30] <taplar> cool, i was just checking it out and it occurred to me the day.
[12:21:56] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah.  deffo.
[12:25:00] <Ice_Strike> $("#status_id_61").addClass('selected').effect("pulsate", { times:3 }, 2000);
[12:25:13] <Ice_Strike> How do remove selected class when that is done?
[12:31:43] <taplar_lunch> i don't see a complete function on it, so maybe promise().then(function(){ $(this).removeClass(); });
[12:33:36] <Ice_Strike> Do you mean:
[12:33:37] <taplar_lunch> wait, yeah it has one
[12:33:44] <Ice_Strike> $("#status_id_61").addClass('selected').effect("pulsate", { times:3 }, 2000).promise().then(function(){ $(this).removeClass(); });
[12:34:05] <taplar_lunch> effect("pulsate", { times:3 }, 2000, function(){ $(this).removeClass('selected'); });
[12:34:11] <taplar_lunch> http://api.jqueryui.com/effect/
[12:34:16] <Ice_Strike> Thank you :)
[12:34:57] <Ice_Strike> Yep that work.
[13:53:42] <z1haze> i am trying to hack a span into acting like a checkbox label but having trouble: https://jsfiddle.net/nytwtwfj/
[13:53:53] <robertmaxrees> why not just use a label?
[13:54:04] <z1haze> i use the label to style the checkbox
[13:54:13] <robertmaxrees> also - .closest() goes to parent elements.
[13:54:17] <robertmaxrees> you have a siubling there.
[13:54:20] <robertmaxrees> *sibling.
[13:54:20] <z1haze> ah
[13:54:25] <z1haze> i thought it just went straight up
[13:54:33] <robertmaxrees> it does - through ancestors of that element.
[13:54:46] <z1haze> what would i use?
[13:55:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd uses closest to get to .squaredThree and then .find() the input.
[13:55:06] <jdubs> I have a script that is using $users.append('some html');    when i separated the html out into multiple users.append....the html goes crazy and formats weird
[13:55:12] <z1haze> i see
[13:55:13] <z1haze> ok thanks
[13:55:15] <jdubs> and idea why that cahnge would do that
[13:55:39] <robertmaxrees> jdubs do you have unclosed elements anywhere?
[13:56:12] <z1haze> voila https://jsfiddle.net/nytwtwfj/1/ thanks robertmaxrees
[13:56:17] <jdubs> no - i literalyl didnt change anything other than just creating two appends
[13:56:28] <robertmaxrees> jdubs i'd have to see it then.
[13:56:36] <jdubs> https://dpaste.de/qVGm
[13:56:42] <jdubs> line 31
[13:56:51] <jdubs> that was just one big connection of html before
[13:56:52] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[13:56:57] <robertmaxrees> mind using something with a valid cert?
[13:57:14] <robertmaxrees> weird - ff rejected dpaste.
[13:57:30] <robertmaxrees> jdubs yeah - tyhat's an unclosed div.
[13:57:35] <notchris> How to add each span text an array item?
[13:57:37] <robertmaxrees> so what happens is jquery closes that for you.
[13:57:45] <notchris> $('td.basket_border span').each(function(){});
[13:57:59] <jdubs> where?
[13:58:02] <robertmaxrees> jdubs so you're not just appending <div class="col-md-4" style="text-align: center"> - you're appending <div class="col-md-4" style="text-align: center"></div>
[13:58:10] <robertmaxrees> notchris huh?
[13:58:13] <jdubs> oh
[13:58:15] <jdubs> how???
[13:58:29] <jdubs> even if its not explicity there?
[13:58:29] <robertmaxrees> jdubs because you can't append just an opening tag.,
[13:58:32] <robertmaxrees> that's invalid markup.
[13:58:38] <robertmaxrees> and would break the page in terrible ways.
[13:58:44] <jdubs> line 45 has the closing div
[13:58:49] <robertmaxrees> right, that does't matter.
[13:58:57] <robertmaxrees> you can't just append an opening tag - jquery is fixing that for you.
[13:59:02] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I have a bunch of spans with text, I want to make an array of each of the span contents
[13:59:02] <jdubs> oh
[13:59:10] <robertmaxrees> notchris use .map().get()
[13:59:11] <notchris> Sorry I didnt phrase it well at first
[13:59:22] <jdubs> what do you use instead?
[13:59:23] <notchris> robertmaxrees: TY ill read that doc now
[13:59:24] <robertmaxrees> $('span').map(function() { return $(this).text() }).get();
[13:59:34] <notchris> ahh
[14:00:18] <robertmaxrees> jdubs do something like var myNewDiv = $('<div class="col-md-4" style="text-align: center">'); and append to myNewDiv in all those spots instead.  then append myNewDiv wherever you want it.
[14:00:37] <jdubs> ok thank you i will try this
[14:02:54] <notchris> robertmaxrees: How do I log that array to the console?
[14:03:11] <jdubs> robertmaxrees:  it worked! thank you!!!
[14:03:14] <robertmaxrees> well that'll return an array - so save it to a var and log that out.
[14:03:17] <robertmaxrees> jdubs deffo.
[14:03:37] <notchris> Ahhh
[14:19:12] <igcewieling> I'm trying change from using callback to using promises and entirely confused.  Here is a fiddle of the callback version. https://jsfiddle.net/fosf5ab1/
[14:20:36] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Thanks again man, good to practice map a bit
[14:22:29] <taplar> igcewieling: so explain more of what you want the end result to be
[14:23:39] <igcewieling> taplar: not sure what you mean.   I want the save() function to run if the validate function thinks the data is validated.    The traditional way would be to run the save function from inside the success handler of the initial ajax call.
[14:24:16] <taplar> ok, so take a look at the then() method
[14:24:26] <taplar> you can give it a success and a failure handler
[14:24:40] <igcewieling> taplar: Yup.  totally confused by that.
[14:24:51] <taplar> your validate method would return the jqXhr object and to that attach your then()
[14:25:08] <igcewieling> just can't figure out how to adapt the very, very, very, simple I put on the fiddle.
[14:26:06] <igcewieling> taplar: (from my sample code on the fiddle)  In the validate() function I would do something like return validate_xhr;  ?
[14:26:17] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/fosf5ab1/2/ i believe
[14:27:15] <igcewieling> I need to use the xhr elsewhere so I can't do exactly your sample, but it does help clairify things.
[14:32:51] <albedoa> MyClass.prototype = { $el: $('<div>') } <—this does not create a new element for each instance of MyClass. it appears to use the same one. how would i go about making a unique element per instance?
[14:34:33] <albedoa> i tried putting it in the constructor...is that the correct approach?
[14:38:28] <robertmaxrees> albedoa it'd have to be in the constructor, though that's kind of a weird pattern
[14:52:28] <albedoa> robertmaxrees know of any decent OO pattern examples specifically for jQuery? been running dry in my searches
[14:53:11] <albedoa> i thought it would be normal for a class instance to have its own element, so i apparently need help
[15:04:14] <igcewieling> taplar (or anyone):  https://jsfiddle.net/pvkrbq09/   line 46, need to make the promise fail from inside the ajax success handler when specific result is returned from the ajax call.
[15:04:37] <igcewieling> would I use something like validate_xhr.fail();
[15:05:19] <cagmz> how can I find an element with a certain aria-label?
[15:07:41] <taplar> igcewieling: so your validate method is returning a success if it logically fails?
[15:09:14] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.reject/
[15:09:27] <igcewieling> Not sure I understand.    Obviously I don't want to run save() if the validation ajax call succeeds, but returns data indicating the provided data was not validated.
[15:10:00] <taplar> personally i'd just make the endpoint not return a 200, but you can always do the reject thing
[15:12:15] <igcewieling> taplar: thanks.
[15:12:26] <taplar> sure
[15:13:42] <taplar> cagmz: i'd find the elements based on something else like a class or tagname, and then filter on the attribute
[15:13:43] <igcewieling> I must be terribly confused.
[15:14:02] <taplar> promises/deferred can be confusing to learn
[15:15:42] <igcewieling> I getting deferred is not defined.   it can be very hard to translate the examples into actual code.
[15:17:16] <arc_> yeah, i don't think the examples are very good on that particular page
[15:17:17] <igcewieling> sorry, wrong paste.   I get validate_xhr.reject() is not a function
[15:19:11] <igcewieling> arc_: if I was using callbacks I'd have been done 2 hours ago.
[15:21:39] <igcewieling> If browsers ran PHP I'd never touch javascript 8-)
[15:22:59] <arc_> uh huh..
[15:35:16] <taplar> igcewieling: https://jsfiddle.net/we6zj89h/
[15:39:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/we6zj89h/1/ <-- now with a good case
[15:41:04] <igcewieling> taplar: Thanks!   That is very helpful.
[15:41:13] <taplar> hope it helps
[15:45:23] <hhee> guys, how can i use jquery in web console (firefox)? like $("li").length; in command line
[15:45:34] <taplar> you can just do it
[15:45:42] <taplar> provided it's loaded on the page
[15:46:04] <hhee> taplar, nope. in my case it's not work
[15:46:31] <taplar> what do you see if in the console you type just: jQuery
[15:46:33] <hhee> taplar, what if jquery have not using in that page? can i load it separate
[15:47:52] <hhee> taplar, oh sorry, now it works. i wrote code in wrong line
[15:48:20] <taplar> also fwiw, if your only wanting to do just simple checking like selects you can always fallback on document.querySelector()
[15:48:26] <hhee> but i wonder if jquery not using in this page, can i load it separately
[15:49:04] <taplar> probably.  i believe some people load jquery in their greasemonkey scripts and use it that way
[15:49:16] <hhee> taplar, ok, tnx got it!
[15:55:41] <tsnfoo> Is there a transition delay baked into the tab widget in jquery mobile?
[15:56:46] <tsnfoo> Just started a new cordova project, and tapping tabs in the iOS emu lags. The tab is highlighted righ away, so I assume the vclick is firing without delay.
[16:04:50] <AlexP11223> which event should I use in jQuery mobile if I want to support both click and touch? vclick? $.support.touch ? "tap" : "click"? .on("click tap")?
[16:06:08] <tsnfoo> AlexP11223: I was just googling that. After reading like 20 SO posts, I concluded that vclick seems safest.
[16:06:30] <taplar> i've tried using click and touchend
[16:06:46] <AlexP11223> vclick documentation says something about delays
[16:07:27] <tsnfoo> I’m fighting delay issues as well, but vclick should avoid the 300ms delay on most touch platforms, if I’m reading the doc correctly.
[16:08:17] <tsnfoo> taplar: touchend is supposed to the most reliable for iOS, yeah?
[16:08:41] <taplar> no clue.  let it be known i'm a mobile newblet, ;)
[16:08:47] <tsnfoo> LOL
[16:09:37] <taplar> seemed to work fine though on my kindle fire and my friends blackberry and my other friends....android?
[16:40:43] <igcewieling> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/we6zj89h/1/ is very helpful, it should be one of the examples in the docs.    Thanks again for the help.
[16:42:02] <Mrprocom> hi, I'm trying to make a div appear after another one disappears using fadeIn and fadeOut under a special condition, https://jsfiddle.net/hLse6uc1/1/
[16:42:22] <Mrprocom> the condition is that I have many of these I want to show individually
[16:42:37] <Mrprocom> the problem with it is that it acts weird for some reason
[16:43:54] <Mrprocom> I know I could have used (in line 4, 10, 16) "#b, #c", "#a, #c" and "#b, #c" instead of ".tab", but I have many of these
[16:46:36] <Mrprocom> wait, it still acts weirdly that way
[16:47:20] <Mrprocom> it's supposed to show a when b and c finished fading, but it does both at the same time

[16:54:45] <Mrprocom> never mind, I found a way around it https://jsfiddle.net/hLse6uc1/3/ :)
[16:57:04] <shoky> Mrprocom: fwiw i'd do it like one of these  https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hLse6uc1/4/   https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hLse6uc1/5/
[16:59:53] <Mrprocom> shoky: I'm not looking for the fading look of the first one, but I like the method of the second one, thanks
[17:00:13] <shoky> only difference between them is the transition-delay
[19:21:53] <ascheel> Trying to do a jquery demo for a homework assignment and I'm demoing "size".  How do I get it to remain at the smaller size after it shrinks?  Mine just immediately snaps to its original shape.  http://scheels.dyndns.org/weber/A12/jquery.html
[19:41:24] <shoky> ascheel: that seems to be a problem with jquery-ui, happens in their example too  http://api.jqueryui.com/size-effect/
[21:53:58] <Guest94064> having a bad day getting started with jqueryui...
[21:54:38] <Guest94064> my zip download does not look like the books suggest it should
[21:55:38] <Guest94064> boks say it should have directories css,js,development-bundle, and I get nothing like that
[21:59:25] <Guest94064> I get 9 files and 2 different directories. 9 files are sort of related to jqueryui
[22:01:59] <Guest94064> ok, life is too short
[22:25:15] <ascheel> shoky: thanks for your response.
