[00:38:34] <Bjerre> o/
[00:39:17] <Ugolin> hello, best practice question
[00:39:29] <Ugolin> I am on my way to refactor some js in my app
[00:40:27] <Bjerre> what's the question Ugolin :)
[00:40:46] <AcidRain2012> bro i cleaned my comp earlier. and dropped the cpu
[00:41:06] <Ugolin> We are at the point where we have a lot of small scripts $(document).ready({$('.someclass') etc...
[00:41:18] <Bjerre> AcidRain2012: Why did you remove the cpu when cleaning it?
[00:41:38] <Ugolin> Is it ok or is it preferable to have them in one bug script that parse the DOM onece for all ?
[00:41:51] <Ugolin> one big*
[00:42:08] <Bjerre> well if they are all .ready I would assume it be better to combine it
[00:42:16] <AcidRain2012> well the thermal paste had been "glued" to the heatsink
[00:42:51] <Bjerre> well doesn't explain why you would remove either heatsink or cpu AcidRain2012
[00:42:57] <Bjerre> on cleaning the computer
[00:43:01] <Ugolin> Bjerre: Ok, so in order to optimize my stuff it is best to avoid parsing the DOM multiple times
[00:43:49] <Bjerre> decx: what would you prefer in Ugolin's question?
[00:45:17] <Bjerre> Ugolin: how many kb's is the js right now?
[00:45:34] <Bjerre> and are you having some high ms?
[00:45:36] <Bjerre> upon load
[00:47:17] <Ugolin> Bjerre: compiled 1,2 M
[00:47:25] <Bjerre> that's quite big Ugolin
[00:47:51] <Bjerre> depends on what you're doing though
[00:48:30] <Ugolin> Yes, just realizing it, but we have jquery, backbone, fullcalendar, codemirror, etc.. etc ..)
[00:48:33] <Bjerre> at least make variables of document.ready :)
[00:48:52] <Bjerre> ok
[00:49:01] <Ugolin> in fact this is my question, my IDE keep talking of that
[00:49:26] <Ugolin> making variables of objects (DOM element, etc ..)
[00:49:49] <Ugolin> so this is the way ? Make varibale ASAP, re-use them
[00:50:05] <Bjerre> yea that's what I would start with
[00:50:11] <Bjerre> it makes it a whole lot easier to read as well
[00:50:33] <Bjerre> what kind of app you're doing?
[00:50:42] <Ugolin> Business app, B2B
[00:50:46] <Bjerre> ok
[00:51:25] <Ugolin> Thanks for your feedback Bjerre
[00:51:29] <Bjerre> np Ugolin
[00:51:57] <Bjerre> Uhkis: are you here?
[00:57:24] <Macaveli> Is it possible to do a selector for a span with data-object-label
[00:58:25] <Macaveli> Found it :) $("span[data-object-label$='ZINSS_NUMBER']")
[01:23:02] <c4400> hey can someone look and see if I have a javascript problem or css problem? I have tabbed content, some of my second tab's info is showing up on the first at the bottom
[01:28:58] <Bjerre> need a little help with this one.. 1. How can I add a delay on the keybinds and clicks between the buttons so you can't swap so fast? 2. Why is the $buttons.length not making it jump back again if you press right arrow multiple times? 3. How can I avoid it from being deselected e.g removing the class on multiple clicks? 4. Is there a way to open up a site if you press on "A" on the keyboard if btn1 is active and a different site if b
[01:29:03] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/ here is the jsfiddle
[01:38:34] <sagerdearia> For a select element with options elements that have value attributes, but also text data (inside the <option></option> tags), is it possible to use jQuery to set the value of the select box using the data inside of an option element and not the value attribute?
[01:39:56] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/1/ solved the left and right arrow thingy, still need to know if there is a way to open a site if btn1 is active and a different site if btn2 is active
[01:40:21] <Bjerre> any help is much appreciated
[01:41:19] <Bjerre> and also the click is working the opposite way
[01:41:27] <Bjerre> clicking on btn1 makes btn2 active :E
[01:47:50] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/2/
[01:48:17] <Cork> Bjerre: what you you mean open site?
[01:48:25] <Cork> like a redirect the page?
[01:48:25] <Bjerre> hi Cork
[01:48:51] <Bjerre> nah, just as an example for the project that i use. In the project I will jump to a new scene (its a SPA)
[01:49:19] <Bjerre> I will use left and right arrow and then hit a keyboard button to select it, or more like click on it
[01:49:29] <Bjerre> so it will highlight the button first with left and right arrow
[01:49:38] <Bjerre> then select it with "A" on the keyboard
[01:49:39] <Cork> uh, no
[01:49:44] <Cork> left and right clicks the buttons
[01:49:46] <Cork> not highlight
[01:49:58] <Bjerre> true cork
[01:50:07] <Cork> if you just want highlight use .focus() instead
[01:50:20] <Cork> (and style it through css)
[01:50:24] <Bjerre> to add .active css?
[01:50:34] <Bjerre> or just replace .active with .focus?
[01:50:37] <Cork> button:focus {}
[01:50:42] <Bjerre> ok
[01:50:58] <Bjerre> and when I click on it as well as use "A" on the keyboard, how would you solve that?
[01:51:11] <Bjerre> how to determine which one is focused
[01:51:43] <Cork> document.activeElement
[01:52:33] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/3/
[01:52:36] <Bjerre> I'm not sure
[01:52:56] <Bjerre> what should I use instead of click?
[01:53:00] <Bjerre> in the jquery
[01:53:06] <Cork> you're still using a class
[01:53:19] <Bjerre> ye well the buttons wont be buttons later on
[01:53:22] <Cork> and you're still lisning for click
[01:53:22] <Bjerre> they will be a class
[01:54:16] <Cork> ok, then use classes
[01:54:28] <Cork> but you won't use :focus then
[01:54:34] <Bjerre> ok
[01:54:44] <Bjerre> so instead of click?
[01:54:57] <Cork> well addClass i guess
[02:00:21] <Bjerre> to be more specific Cork the class doesn't have to be added on click. It only needs to be added when using left and right arrow. the click on btn1 or btn2 should direct the user to a new scene in the project, and in this case I want it to open up a site or show a picture w/e. However, the left and arrow should add the class as it is doing right now, but upon pressing A on keyboard it should do the same thing as the click. This sounds
[02:00:25] <Bjerre> so give me a minute :)
[02:01:47] <Bjerre> nvm
[02:01:51] <Bjerre> wasn't that easy :(
[02:08:04] <Bjerre> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/4/
[02:08:16] <Bjerre> not sure on how to use an if inside an if
[02:09:33] <Cork> Bjerre: firstly, you don't need to handle disabled in the click handler
[02:09:39] <Cork> click won't fire on a disabled button
[02:09:49] <Cork> (unless you fire it through js)
[02:10:06] <Bjerre> ok
[02:12:11] <Bjerre> will it not try to invoke the addClass over and over again if not disabled?
[02:15:32] <Cork> Bjerre: this is what i talked about http://jsfiddle.net/3h270ov7/5/
[02:16:08] <Cork> (click in the preview window to see it)
[02:17:03] <Bjerre> that worked splendid
[02:17:09] <Bjerre> thank you so much Cork
[02:18:42] <Bjerre> does the focus only work with buttons Cork ?
[02:19:00] <Cork> Bjerre: and here is one that replaces the focus outline http://jsfiddle.net/3h270ov7/6/
[02:19:10] <Cork> Bjerre: it works with elements that have tabindex
[02:19:20] <Cork> so <div tabindex="-1"> works
[02:19:32] <Cork> (or 0 or any positive number)
[02:19:42] <Bjerre> oh ok
[02:19:43] <Bjerre> I see
[02:19:45] <Bjerre> thanks man!
[02:23:34] <Bjerre> Cork: the 65 should trigger like enter does
[02:23:41] <Bjerre> any way to add that?
[02:25:02] <Cork> Bjerre: you would need a separate case for that
[02:27:20] <Cork> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/3h270ov7/7/
[02:27:55] <Cork> opps missed the focus
[02:28:14] <Bjerre> it worked for button 1 :D
[02:28:38] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/3h270ov7/9/
[02:33:38] <Bjerre> nice Cork, however it shows the same index on A
[02:33:43] <Bjerre> on both btn
[02:33:59] <Bjerre> any reason why it is keyCode 66 on btn 2?
[02:34:13] <Cork> cause it is 65+1 :)
[02:34:38] <Bjerre> and it counts the index?
[02:34:53] <abailarri> Hello. I have this small script but the time of fadeout not works, dessapears instantlly. Any suggestion? https://jsfiddle.net/ah2hnu7v/
[02:34:57] <Bjerre> I don't get it Cork  :P
[02:35:12] <Cork> ah, now i get it...
[02:36:20] <Bjerre> Have you heard of the thing called Makey Makey Cork ?
[02:36:24] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/3h270ov7/10/
[02:36:34] <Bjerre> it doesn't have enter :/
[02:36:57] <Cork> no can't say i've heard of it
[02:37:11] <Cork> what do you mean doesn't have enter?
[02:37:13] <Bjerre> still shows index 1 on "A" at btn 2
[02:37:25] <Cork> doesn't here...
[02:38:06] <Cork> what os are you on?
[02:38:15] <Bjerre> yosemite
[02:38:18] <Bjerre> chrome
[02:38:25] <Cork> ah, ya mac has a messed up focus system
[02:38:33] <Bjerre> darn
[02:38:47] <Cork> when you focus things macs doesn't always do that
[02:38:52] <Bjerre> I see
[02:39:09] <Cork> though click should still click the right element...
[02:39:17] <Cork> not sure what happens there
[02:39:22] <Bjerre> it clicks on the first one only
[02:39:27] <Bjerre> even if I focus the second one
[02:39:31] <Bjerre> however
[02:39:33] <Bjerre> enter does the trick
[02:39:34] <Cork> wait a min...
[02:39:37] <Bjerre> but Makey Makey doesnt allow enter
[02:39:41] <Cork> a should always be the same as enter?
[02:39:45] <Bjerre> yes
[02:39:47] <Cork> ah...
[02:39:47] <Bjerre> excactly
[02:39:52] <Cork> that isn't what i coded...
[02:40:01] <Cork> a clicks the first button and b clicks the second

[02:41:32] <JosefDe> Hi guys. Why is slideToggle() not working with tables?: https://jsfiddle.net/4aju8du9/3/
[02:41:53] <JosefDe> The table disappears immediately and not slow, in progress
[02:42:00] <Cork> JosefDe: cause the height of a table is controlled by the height of its children
[02:42:11] <JosefDe> Cork: What can I do to solve this?
[02:42:14] <Cork> wrap it in a div and slide that
[02:42:27] <Cork> (don't forget overflow hidden on the parent)
[02:42:37] <JosefDe> perfect! Thanks
[02:42:38] <Cork> oh, wait slide sets that by default
[02:42:47] <JosefDe> thanks!
[02:42:48] <Cork> so just wrap it in a div and things should work
[03:13:37] <Bjerre> Awesome Cork thank you so much for your help as per usual!
[03:14:50] <Bjerre> I still don't get what 65+1 does though :)

[04:13:15] <zignd> hi there! can someone help me with a quick question? i'm reading on jqueryui on learn.jquery.com and i have a doubt about one thing. what is the difference between calling `$("#p1").progressbar("option", {value: 30, disabled: false})` and `$("#p1").progressbar({value: 30, disabled: false})`?
[04:14:30] <yottanami> I have a select with options like this <option value="1">text</option> I can load value by $('#select').val(); but I need to load the text of option
[04:14:37] <yottanami> How should I do it?
[04:20:20] <yottanami> $("#list option:selected").text(); returns an empty string
[04:22:14] <Cork> yottanami: that one should work
[04:22:56] <yottanami> Cork: Which one? this one you mean? $("#list option:selected").text();
[04:23:15] <Cork> yes
[04:23:22] <yottanami> Cork: $("#list:selected")  returns an empty array
[04:23:32] <Cork> ya, that one is wrong
[04:24:06] <yottanami> Cork: So how can I do it?
[04:24:16] <Cork> $("#list option:selected").text(); <--
[04:24:19] <Cork> that one should work

[04:28:57] <Bjerre> Cork: I tried to implement the code within the editor and I'm mindblown. It doesn't work, it get's stuck on index 2
[04:29:20] <Bjerre> Is there any other way to use this without focus?
[04:29:55] <Cork> Bjerre: sure, but you will have to keep the "active" tab in js instead of in the focus reference
[04:30:10] <Cork> and you will have to reimplement all the native focus features
[04:30:26] <Bjerre> :/
[04:30:40] <Bjerre> I changed some stuff to not invoke other "index" that I have on the SPA
[04:30:41] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/12/
[04:31:30] <Bjerre> is there no way to make an if statement that if "A" is clicked while ballbtn1 is active > do this?
[04:32:09] <Bjerre> or I guess that's what you told me
[04:37:28] <arup_r> any help
[04:38:11] <Bjerre> ops Cork forgot the html :) http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/3h270ov7/13/
[04:55:32] <Bjerre> Cork: the focus works except the switch
[04:55:35] <Bjerre> any idea why?
[04:55:43] <Bjerre> I hate that I've been used to this editor
[04:55:55] <Bjerre> you have no control whatsoever on what's wrong or not
[04:56:19] <Bjerre> and now it's too late to switch editor in this project
[04:56:50] <mdunbavan1985> Hi, has anyone ever used $ajax request and used different html for different data key names before?
[05:04:44] <Bjerre> Cork: it was a stupid mistake by me. It works now
[05:04:50] <Bjerre> thank you again, you're awesome
[05:35:14] <kuter> guys, i've load another page into some div on click method .. i'd like to prevent from loading this page twice, how to achive that ?
[05:35:54] <kuter> variable ? or check if some elements exists on page ?
[05:38:46] <Cork> kuter: simplest would be to store a value in data() on the link
[05:39:15] <Cork> so when the click method fires it checks if .data('loaded') and in that case just exist early
[05:39:26] <Cork> and last in the function you do .data('loaded', true)
[05:40:25] <kuter> Cork: i don't get it ..
[05:40:53] <Shebbi> Hi. How to get all the text from this HTML code: <td id="foo"><span>text1</span><span>text2</span></td>
[05:41:10] <Shebbi> tried $('#foo').text()
[05:41:23] <kuter> Shebbi: .each()
[05:41:43] <Shebbi> tried $('#foo').each().text()??
[05:41:59] <kuter> iterate throught each span and get text value
[05:42:18] <Shebbi> how you do that?
[05:42:23] <Cork> Shebbi: .text should work
[05:42:37] <Cork> but what is the context?
[05:42:41] <Cork> is  <td id="foo"><span>text1</span><span>text2</span></td> a string?
[05:42:55] <kuter> Cork: http://pastebin.com/AnbJTMhB look at my code pls.
[05:43:00] <Shebbi> it's HTML from a page
[05:43:19] <Shebbi> using jquery to retrieve the text
[05:43:35] <Shebbi> table data
[05:43:35] <kuter> Shebbi: https://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:43:37] <Cork> Shebbi: so you do something like $(data).find('#foo).test()?
[05:43:49] <Cork> kuter: no, each isn't the answer
[05:44:12] <kuter> Cork: just guessing.
[05:44:46] <Shebbi> Cork: doesn't work.
[05:44:55] <Cork> kuter: http://jsfiddle.net/guuwbchz/
[05:45:02] <Shebbi> it won't retrieve text within the span
[05:45:05] <Cork> Shebbi: that was a question not a solution
[05:45:29] <Shebbi> <Shebbi> tried $('#foo').text()
[05:46:15] <Cork> Shebbi: http://jsfiddle.net/8gz6absq/
[05:46:27] <Cork> that is just me guessing at what you're doing though
[05:48:56] <Shebbi> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/8gz6absq/3/

[05:49:37] <kuter> Cork: thanks a lot ! ;)
[05:49:43] <Cork> so ya, the td gets lost
[05:49:44] <arup_r> what I need to change ?
[05:50:06] <Cork> Shebbi: and when the td gets removed so does the id
[05:50:11] <Cork> so the id isn't in the page
[05:50:54] <Shebbi> Cork: it's just a snippet. I can put td in table for you but doesn't solve my problem.

[06:04:09] <Shebbi> whats the right code for finding a specific sibling element downstream from a current sibling element?
[06:04:23] <Cork> .nextAll()
[06:04:32] <Cork> though it isn't down stream
[06:04:38] <Cork> it is just siblings after it in the list
[06:05:20] <Shebbi> <td id="current"></td>...<td id="foo"></td>
[06:05:40] <Cork> its ids
[06:05:40] <Shebbi> $(this).sibling('#foo')?
[06:05:45] <Cork> you don't need to use sibling
[06:05:57] <Cork> $('#foo') works there
[06:05:59] <Shebbi> <td id="current"></td>...<td class="foo"></td>
[06:06:05] <Shebbi> it's suppose to be class
[06:06:05] <Cork> as long as error correction haven't removed the element
[06:06:20] <Cork> so... the id has been a class this hole time?
[06:06:32] <Shebbi> pretty much
[06:06:47] <Cork> Shebbi: could you make a jsfiddle matching what you're actually trying to do
[06:06:47] <Shebbi> <td class="current"></td>...<td class="foo"></td>
[06:06:57] <Shebbi> $(this).sibling('#foo')?
[06:07:04] <Cork> instead of a ton of diverted spudo html
[06:07:13] <Shebbi> I suck

[06:07:45] <Bjerre> do I need an else value?
[06:08:03] <Cork> Bjerre: can't really answer that
[06:08:26] <Bjerre> because of the scenetransition in my editor?
[06:08:37] <Cork> cause too much of the context is missing
[06:08:44] <Bjerre> I see
[06:08:58] <Bjerre> can't add it on jsfiddle, SPA

[06:15:38] <Cork> well more exactly 1.9+
[06:19:09] <Shebbi> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/8gz6absq/7/
[06:20:13] <Bjerre> and why is this not triggering the button at all? I used the variable and that didnt work at all  http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/fqyz37pj/1/
[06:20:27] <new0> how do i puase antmate while it play?
[06:45:44] <rickthuc> hello, i am trying to fade in a text when the parent div reaches the top, i am using the window.scroll function to do it...but is not showing up at all..http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/5/
[06:46:14] <Cork> rickthuc: you need to bind the scroll event
[06:46:21] <Cork> else you only check as the page loads
[06:46:50] <rickthuc> $(window).bind("scroll", function(){ ?
[06:47:36] <Cork> yes
[06:47:54] <Bjerre> Cork: I have no idea what is going on. I've assigned a button that will jump back to a previous scene (which you cant see in the fiddle) and then a javascript that triggers the button but it doesn't work. It have been working on all other classes except for this one. http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/fqyz37pj/2/
[06:49:11] <rickthuc> i used that also, nothing happens
[06:49:13] <Bjerre> is it something wrong in that code I provided?
[06:51:22] <Shebbi> http://jsfiddle.net/8gz6absq/8/
[06:51:26] <Shebbi> anyone care to help?
[06:52:23] <Cork> Shebbi: ask the question, not for someone
[06:52:48] <Shebbi> the question is in the jsfiddle
[06:58:09] <Shebbi> the question is too noob to get an asnwer here lol
[06:58:16] <rickthuc> all bots here
[06:58:22] <rickthuc> dont know who fills the room
[06:58:33] <Cork> Shebbi: more like if you want ppl to follow a link to see the question, you don't want answers
[06:58:52] <rickthuc> Cork: I added bind scoll, nothing happens
[06:59:20] <Cork> rickthuc: link?
[06:59:22] <rickthuc> scroll*
[06:59:28] <rickthuc> http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/5/
[06:59:43] <Cork> there isn't any scroll event handler there
[06:59:44] <Shebbi> Cork: of course I want answers. you're the one who told me to make a jsfiddle.
[07:00:36] <Shebbi> <Cork> Shebbi: could you make a jsfiddle matching what you're actually trying to do
[07:01:02] <rickthuc> Cork: there is...
[07:01:50] <rickthuc> oh didn't save..
[07:02:59] <rickthuc> http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/6/
[07:03:58] <decx> distance will never be guaranteed to be that exact value
[07:05:08] <rickthuc> how can i detect if its 110px from window top
[07:05:10] <Cork> also #member != #members
[07:05:20] <cjohnson> rickthuc: .offset()
[07:06:17] <Cork> rickthuc: http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/8/
[07:06:45] <decx> weird reflow
[07:06:49] <Cork> ya
[07:06:57] <Cork> but the if case triggers
[07:08:08] <charlie_> could anyone tell me why this is polling for a file straight away instead of waiting 15 seconds ? http://pastebin.com/A5WfgVMB
[07:08:27] <rickthuc> ?
[07:08:58] <Cork> uh...
[07:09:06] <Cork> charlie_: what part are you asking about?
[07:09:21] <Cork> you have one setInterval that fires every second
[07:09:33] <Cork> and a setTimeout that waits 15 seconds
[07:09:43] <dimi1947> cork is it you that you had told me to avoid selectos like this ("p[class*='fill']")?
[07:09:46] <Cork> and then you have an animate that takes 15 seconds
[07:09:53] <charlie_> yeah, the polling works, I just dont want it to start polling for the first 15 seconds
[07:09:57] <Cork> dimi1947: yes
[07:10:17] <dimi1947> thanks for reminding...
[07:10:17] <charlie_> looking at the inspector in chrome it polls straight away
[07:10:20] <Cork> charlie_: so you haev to have setTimeout do the function call instead of directly call it
[07:10:43] <Cork> charlie_: scure, cause pollInterval = setInterval(function() { poll(); }, 1000);
[07:10:46] <Cork> *sure
[07:11:39] <rickthuc> Cork: and what is that
[07:12:03] <Cork> richardwhiuk: what is what?
[07:12:22] <rickthuc> http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/8/ ?
[07:12:27] <rickthuc> nvm
[07:15:11] <charlie_> Cork: ok so pollInterval = setTimeout(function() { setInterval(function() { poll(); }, 1000); }, 14000); should work?
[07:15:32] <Cork> well that is one way to do it
[07:15:41] <charlie_> just tried it does, just a bit messy code :)
[07:15:42] <Cork> or you could just set a setTimeout instead of the scope
[07:16:01] <charlie_> what do you mean?
[07:16:10] <Cork> (function() {})() => setTimeout(function() {}, 14000)
[07:16:39] <Cork> (line 3)
[07:17:00] <charlie_> ah, that looks nicer thanks
[07:20:53] <charlie_> hmm, not working though
[07:27:55] <Jabberwock> var foo = function() { poll(); }; setInterval(foo, 1000);
[07:30:04] <diegoviola> hi
[07:30:27] <diegoviola> is there a way to calculate the last time a user typed something on a <input>?
[07:31:25] <rickthuc> lol
[07:31:38] <diegoviola> what's so funny?
[07:32:03] <rickthuc> diegoviola: the only way i can think of is by using a cookie..
[07:32:21] <rickthuc> but that would be php
[07:32:31] <cjohnson> don't use setInterval charlie_
[07:32:32] <cjohnson> it's broken
[07:32:38] <hlvwrk> lol
[07:32:39] <diegoviola> I want to type a character on a input and then 20 seconds later add some text to the screen
[07:32:45] <cjohnson> instead just use setTimeout to trigger another setTimeout
[07:32:50] <cjohnson> for real -- setInterval is broken.
[07:33:03] <diegoviola> how to do this?
[07:33:04] <rickthuc> funny is they are discussing setinterval, 1000 then 14000 so on lol
[07:33:12] <diegoviola> anyone?
[07:33:14] <charlie_> cjohnson: yeah literally just found this http://reallifejs.com/brainchunks/repeated-events-timeout-or-interval/ saying the same thing
[07:33:14] <charlie_> thanks
[07:33:19] <rickthuc> i told you how
[07:33:24] <cjohnson> http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[07:33:29] <cjohnson> charlie_: aha yep :)
[07:33:55] <diegoviola> rickthuc: setTimeout?
[07:34:00] <rickthuc> ?
[07:34:12] <decx> it also never stops
[07:34:20] <decx> we have raf now
[07:34:44] <diegoviola> diegoviola | I want to type a character on a input and then 20 seconds later add some text to the screen
[07:34:52] <diegoviola> rickthuc | i told you how
[07:34:57] <cjohnson> well you can clearInterval just like clearTimeout. but still, in some cases it will simply *drop* some interval requests if they're taking too long
[07:34:59] <diegoviola> it's not clear what you suggested
[07:35:32] <diegoviola> hrm
[07:35:34] <diegoviola> nvm
[07:37:23] <Jabberwock> diegoviola: So you don't need it to persist?
[07:37:28] <Jabberwock> If not then a cookie is not needed.
[07:37:39] <diegoviola> Jabberwock: no, I don't need persistence
[07:38:01] <Jabberwock> You can set an onchange listener and record the time. Then set a timer via setInterval to check the time for time + 20 minutes
[07:38:21] <Jabberwock> Or onkeyup/onkeydown etc
[07:38:27] <diegoviola> thanks
[07:38:29] <Jabberwock> np
[07:50:31] <KebabBob> I'm using el.siblings('.sel')[0] quite a bit in my code.. What's the proper way to get a jquery object from this? Just $(el.siblings('.sel')[0]) ?
[07:55:23] <decx> eq()
[07:57:12] <dcherman> KebabBob: `.first()`
[08:01:50] <Jabberwock> KebabBob: [0] will give you the DOMElement (non-jQuery) afaik
[08:06:27] <charlie_> cjohnson: ok got the poll working with setTimeout, this code should be safe right http://pastebin.com/KunB22iZ ?
[08:11:46] <cjohnson> yep charlie_ looks good
[08:11:52] <cjohnson> side note: I didn't know about that statusCode thing
[08:11:54] <cjohnson> that's pretty cool
[08:12:25] <charlie_> thanks
[08:12:31] <charlie_> yeah, works really well for what I was trying to acheive
[08:12:37] <cjohnson> KebabBob: most of the methods that operate on one node will already do that for you fyi
[08:13:00] <cjohnson> var html = $('.a-bunch-of-elements').html() will iirc just pull the first node's innerHTML
[08:13:06] <Jabberwock> charlie_: What if it gets multiple 404s?
[08:13:10] <cjohnson> though it's prob best to be explicit
[08:13:13] <Jabberwock> It looks like it has the possibility of recursion.
[08:13:20] <cjohnson> that's hte point
[08:13:26] <cjohnson> it continues to poll until 200
[08:13:41] <cjohnson> or at least that's what I think the point is
[08:13:55] <Jabberwock> It mean it is stacking calls which doesn't seem desired for a single threaded language
[08:14:21] <cjohnson> nah it shouldn't, setTimeout will then call the poll method in a new scope
[08:14:28] <Jabberwock> ok
[08:14:51] <cjohnson> or maybe not "new scope" exactly but JS is smart enough to figure this one out to not infinitely build up the stack
[08:15:27] <charlie_> I have a script running on a server that generates the file being polled for. It can sometimes run over 15 seconds to process though so wanted to keep polling until its created.
[08:15:56] <Jabberwock> cjohnson: I think you're right. I probably would have cleared the timeout before setting a new one.
[08:16:43] <Jabberwock> and I have no idea how that would affect scope with hoisting. My brain is spagooter today
[08:16:57] <cjohnson> Jabberwock: well there's no need, it's already cleared
[08:17:14] <cjohnson> setTimeout will clear and call poll in 1000 ms
[08:17:24] <cjohnson> then it will set a new setTimeout and repeat the process
[08:17:31] <Jabberwock> Oh. I did not know that. Thanks. :)
[08:18:14] <cjohnson> as far as scope poll is only defined once, it won't create a new scope each time. now if your setTimeout looked like this: setTimeout(function() { poll(somethingFromPoll); }, 1000) ;that would probably have poor effects
[08:18:23] <cjohnson> assuming you defined somethingFromPoll farther up in the poll function body
[08:18:44] <rickthuc> how can i check the distance of a div from the top of the window ?
[08:18:52] <cjohnson> rickthuc: like I told you, .offset()
[08:19:31] <rickthuc> so var offset = $('#element').offset(); var top = offset.top; ?
[08:19:48] <Jabberwock> Test it out :)
[08:19:51] <cjohnson> if that's what the docs say :)
[08:19:58] <cjohnson> rtfm! :P
[08:19:58] <rickthuc> did already and its not doing it duh
[08:20:09] <rickthuc> thats why came back to ask again
[08:20:17] <cjohnson> read the docs, if you can't figure it out, make a fiddle
[08:20:28] <rickthuc> did you test it out?
[08:20:40] <cjohnson> I'm waiting for your fiddle to do so
[08:20:51] <rickthuc> yeah
[08:21:22] <rickthuc> there was a scroll plugin, i forgot its name, it used to do the same
[08:21:26] <cjohnson> also "it's not doing it" is utterly meaningless. What is it doing? do you get an error?
[08:21:33] <cjohnson> there's no need for any plugin
[08:21:46] <rickthuc> it staying at a fixed position, on start
[08:21:56] <rickthuc> just shows 480 while its not 480
[08:22:10] <cjohnson> what do you mean staying at a fixed position. You asked how to *get* the position of a node
[08:22:21] <cjohnson> this code won't move anything
[08:22:53] <rickthuc> am doing it on .scroll
[08:23:01] <cjohnson> make a fiddle
[08:23:05] <cjohnson> there's more to your story
[08:23:24] <rickthuc> yeah
[08:26:13] <rickthuc> http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/9/
[08:26:13] <rickthuc> see
[08:28:13] <cjohnson> 1: use on, not bind
[08:28:20] <cjohnson> 2: what you have seems to be working correctly
[08:28:37] <cjohnson> #members position doesn't change as you scroll
[08:29:29] <cjohnson> rickthuc: take a look at getBoundingClientRect()
[08:29:38] <cjohnson> I think that's what you want
[08:29:52] <decx> what for?
[08:30:46] <Guest52873> stupid question: https://gist.github.com/K4T/137b27c21f84ac5a6849 - why $searchButtons is undefined in line 7?
[08:32:04] <Guest52873> nvm
[08:33:20] <Jabberwock> Guest52873: You can always toss in "debugger;" and fire it up in Chrome
[08:37:42] <rickthuc> huh
[08:39:09] <rickthuc> what is that now
[08:40:05] <Jabberwock> que?
[08:40:48] <levo> i have 4 radio buttons which are dynamically created via js, (name=radios) , how can I get the value of select radio upon click?
[08:41:35] <cjohnson> rickthuc: read the docs.
[08:41:46] <cjohnson> google "mdn getBoundingClientRect()"
[08:41:47] <levo> *selected
[08:41:50] <cjohnson> lots of info available
[08:42:36] <rickthuc> lol
[08:43:01] <decx> no reason to use getBoundingClientRect with jquery tho
[08:44:37] <rickthuc> then what to use
[08:46:12] <decx> you already have all the info you need with offset and scrollTop
[08:47:23] <rickthuc> ...
[08:48:18] <ashka> hey, is there a version of .prop('checked', true) that would trigger the handlers registered with .change() ?
[08:48:33] <rickthuc> i guess everyone's just guessing here
[08:49:03] <decx> you have to trigger('change') manually after you set the prop
[08:49:15] <ashka> mh, okay. thanks
[08:51:28] <rickthuc> jeez like

[08:58:10] <assembledbits> omg nvm
[08:58:22] <assembledbits> I forgot how jQuery works, I'm a dumb

[09:18:48] <RedRat> hi guys
[09:19:00] <sk0al> http://jsfiddle.net/8kv9jw2b/4/ Could someone maybe check this out and help me with a question. when you click the first image of the people down at the bottom it changes the data-attribute to on or off. But I also have it set so that if that attirbute is set to off it won't give the mouseover effect. So since the other images have mouseover when you click that image it updates the image but then it sees the mouseover and changes it bac
[09:19:03] <sk0al> hope that makes sense lol
[09:19:10] <sk0al> trying to figure out a fix or a solution for this
[09:22:21] <RedRat> unload() isn't to work only when closes tab or window?
[09:24:25] <sk0al> if I am using an if statement based off of a data atrribute and inside this code it also changes the data attribute how can I have the initial function notice that change.. Maybe that makes more sense.
[09:25:05] <cjohnson> don't use .attr to set data values
[09:25:07] <cjohnson> use .data
[09:25:16] <sk0al> I tried using .data and it didn't update
[09:25:16] <cjohnson> they are different things
[09:25:24] <cjohnson> yes it did
[09:25:30] <cjohnson> did you read it back using data too?
[09:25:35] <cjohnson> don't use attr at all
[09:25:37] <sk0al> wasn't working for me for some reason.
[09:25:47] <cjohnson> if you write using data then read using attr it won't reflect your change
[09:25:53] <cjohnson> because again, they are different things
[09:25:55] <sk0al> Well, I am kinda new to jquery.
[09:25:58] <sk0al> hmm ok
[09:27:43] <sk0al> I updated l line 41 http://jsfiddle.net/8kv9jw2b/6/
[09:27:51] <sk0al> and the data attribute is not being updated.
[09:31:39] <decx> imageAttributes won't be updated juts because you change data in the click
[09:31:53] <decx> only once on load
[09:35:56] <sk0al> $(this).data('attribute', 'on'); is this the proper way to update a data attribute?
[09:36:06] <sk0al> if its name is data-attribute ?
[09:36:19] <decx> yeah but your whole event binding is upside down
[09:36:35] <decx> it's never received again after you change it
[09:36:36] <sk0al> what do you mean?
[09:36:53] <decx> you go through each of your things and setup events based on that
[09:37:00] <decx> that won't change just because you change data
[09:37:13] <decx> imageAttribute will never change
[09:37:15] <sk0al> Yea, I didn't think that it would..
[09:37:38] <sk0al> What is the best way to accomplish what I am trying to do?
[09:38:37] <decx> i have no idea what that is
[09:39:35] <sk0al> Well to be able to change the data attrib and also have that each read the change.
[09:40:11] <sk0al> so that when i move my mouse after I click it the image won't change again
[09:41:46] <sebbers> Has anyone here had experiencing parsing out the day and times from a string like the following:
[09:41:46] <sebbers> “I’m available on Tuesday and Thursday from 4:15pm to 7:15pm.
[09:41:47] <sebbers> Then also from 3 to 5 on Wed. and Fri.
[09:41:48] <sebbers> Wed 10:00-2“
[09:42:57] <RedRat> is possible to force session cookies to clean on browsers with last session activated?
[09:45:10] <sk0al> decx: Am I just going about this whole thing wrong?
[09:45:16] <decx> yep
[09:45:27] <decx> have your checks inside your events not outside
[09:45:43] <sk0al> Any advice on a different way to do this?
[09:47:02] <decx> first: use css instead of .hover()
[09:47:50] <sk0al> even if i put that check inside the click function it still wouldn't see the change and my image would be changed when i moved my mouse like it currently is wouldn't it?
[09:48:01] <sk0al> ahh ok
[09:48:22] <sk0al> ohh well actually I can't use CSS since those images are inside an img tag and not background images.
[09:50:08] <decx> well try to rewrite it so you don'T have your event handlers in conditions
[09:50:13] <decx> but conditions in your event handlers
[09:50:38] <decx> it's too convoluted now to give a specific tip
[09:50:41] <Bjerre> hi again guys
[09:51:32] <sk0al> k
[09:52:04] <Bjerre> decx what would be the best way to prevent high buffer usage? I experienced it when I was at work. I believe it has to do with my javascript that loads every time I go to a new page on a SPA
[09:52:44] <decx> the garbage collector will do fine unless you go bananas
[09:54:19] <Bjerre> the thing is that there is a home button which does not reload the page but goes back to the main scene. If I go back and forth between the buttons that loads the javascript it is starting to get laggy
[09:56:29] <decx> well don't load the js again then
[09:58:08] <Bjerre> problem is that it didn't work when I put it in head wrap
[09:58:19] <Bjerre> only when I loaded it to the correct SPA page
[09:58:29] <Bjerre> I assume it has to do with variables
[10:09:33] <cam> hello friend
[10:09:54] <Guest81678> i entered this channel last time in 2011
[10:10:57] <Guest81678> anyone here?
[10:12:49] <Guest81678> hi
[10:13:19] <Bjerre> decx: Take a look at this example http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/fqyz37pj/3/
[10:13:29] <Bjerre> go to javascript console and timeline and start recording
[10:13:37] <Bjerre> do you see the buffer usage that is leaking like crazy?
[10:13:45] <Bjerre> same thing happens in my project at work
[10:14:58] <decx> keycode 40 is down btw
[10:14:59] <sk0al> decx: It seems no matter what I do. Using the format $(this).data('attribute', 'newValie'); will not update. Any idea why?
[10:15:27] <Guest81678> can somebody help me?
[10:15:33] <decx> changed up your events?
[10:15:42] <decx> nobody will help if you don't ask
[10:15:51] <Bjerre> what do you mean decx
[10:15:57] <sk0al> Yea, I moved this click function up above all that other stuff.
[10:16:12] <Bjerre> ah ye I know devx
[10:16:13] <Bjerre> decx:
[10:16:20] <Bjerre> I didnt change that, forgot
[10:16:28] <sk0al> http://jsfiddle.net/8kv9jw2b/7/
[10:16:28] <decx> i dont know what hypeDocument does
[10:16:42] <Bjerre> it's the editor dont mind that
[10:16:57] <decx> you still have event handlers inside conditions sk0al
[10:17:32] <sk0al> the hover ?
[10:17:59] <decx> this is run once on load and has no impact whatsoever on what you set after click
[10:18:29] <catcher> I'm querying an API that takes some time to load audio. I need to call play() directly in an event action (iOS / Safari requirement), so I can't use a callback once it's loaded.  What's the best way to do this?
[10:19:11] <Bjerre> sry decx forgot to change some things
[10:19:12] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/fqyz37pj/4/
[10:19:18] <Bjerre> what I mean is check the console
[10:19:32] <Bjerre> it's crazy how much buffer usage
[10:19:54] <sk0al> its just the hover event that is inside a condition right?
[10:22:03] <Guest81678> I cant remove from the DOM an element generated dinamycalli with Append() function
[10:22:07] <decx> it's 4
[10:22:13] <decx> 4 separate hover evetns
[10:22:15] <decx> should be one
[10:22:25] <decx> and inside you can test against $(this).data()
[10:23:27] <Guest81678> http://jsfiddle.net/9t6djyjv/ i cant remove from the DOM a dinamically generated content with append
[10:25:06] <decx> ids have to be unique, there is no data, the
[10:25:16] <decx> cerrar is dynamic too and has to be delegated
[10:25:21] <decx> too much stuff
[10:25:32] <Bjerre> decx: how do I log both keyCode 37 and 39?
[10:25:39] <Bjerre>  console.log('e.keyCode == 37');
[10:25:59] <Guest81678> i have only one "cerrar" eleement
[10:26:07] <decx> [37,39].indexOf(e.keyCode) > -1
[10:26:47] <decx> every append adds a new #cerrar
[10:27:02] <Bjerre> that only gives "true" as message decx
[10:27:04] <decx> which doesnt exist on pageload meaning your click event is bound to nothing
[10:28:10] <Guest81678> exactly, the cerrar element doesn't exist when the page loads, i generate when user send the form
[10:28:54] <Guest81678> i can remove from the any element but not elements generated with html o append, prepend, etc
[10:31:24] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/9t6djyjv/1/
[10:33:44] <Guest81678> it works perfectly but i don't understand what is happening
[10:34:41] <decx> read this http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[10:43:22] <Guest81678> thank you DECX
[10:43:27] <Guest81678> you are my best friend now
[11:12:50] <alasi> hello, I am trying to scrape a wikipedia article for its first paragraph. I tried: $("#mw-content-text").children("p").first().text(); however it returned nothing. How do i do it properly?
[11:22:43] <christech2> What's the difference between a .click that is outside of a document.ready and one that's within?
[11:24:11] <cjohnson> alasi: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page
[11:24:20] <cjohnson> this is how you do it properly
[11:24:38] <alasi> cjohnson: oh cool ill check that out thanks
[11:25:17] <alasi> thats a lot to sift through
[11:33:52] <RedRat__> is possible to force session cookies to clean on browsers with last session activated?
[11:49:47] <testerbit> If I have this definition inside an object, how can I call it and chain .done to it?: http://pastebin.com/MvGa1Zz0
[11:53:34] <sk0al> http://jsfiddle.net/8kv9jw2b/11/ for the images at the bottom. Could someone help me figure out how once you click on the image to set the previous clicked image back to its off state?
[11:57:44] <Pistachio> How can I add a class to an input that I've created? var input = document.createElement("input");
[12:02:49] <Jabberwock> $(input).addClass('class-name')
[12:03:02] <Jabberwock> or in pure JS input.className = 'class-name';
[12:03:57] <christech2> Jabberwock: I believe input should be within quotes.
[12:04:12] <Jabberwock> christech2: Their variable name is input
[12:04:20] <Jabberwock> Otherwise yes :)
[12:04:28] <christech2> Aha, gotcha ;)
[12:10:59] <sk0al> Anyone know why when I do something like so. $(this).data('state', 'on'); it isn't updating the data-state attribute to on?
[12:15:13] <catcher> sk0al, 1. your code isn't running, 2. $(this) isn't what you think it is, or 3. something else is overwriting it later
[12:20:57] <sk0al> catcher: look at it with firefox
[12:21:09] <sk0al> it only runs when you can mouseover one of the images.
[12:22:00] <arc_> you should use .on('click', instead of .click(
[12:22:41] <arc_> (that won't solve your problem it's just good practice)
[12:22:54] <catcher> sk0al, just noticed your fiddle above
[12:23:29] <arc_> do you intend to set all objects to state off on click, or just one
[12:24:43] <sk0al> When you click on one of the images I want it to turn the state to off on the others.
[12:25:40] <sk0al> and the image to go back to the off image
[12:26:52] <arc_> ok, what is supposed to happen when state is on
[12:27:01] <arc_> because something is happening when i click on it
[12:27:26] <sk0al> When state is on, it will show the on image and if the data-state='on' then the jquery won't use the mouseover effect on that image
[12:27:35] <arc_> it sets data-state to on, it just doesn't set all others to off. which means to me that your selector on line 24, 29, etc is probably wrong
[12:29:24] <sk0al> On line 24 I was trying to use that to find all other items that had state-on and turn it off. But it doesn't seem to be changing properly
[12:29:41] <arc_> i see that
[12:30:41] <arc_> idk why that isn't working. i would have just set a unique class to these four images and selected them that way
[12:31:44] <arc_> it works when i do that
[12:31:45] <sk0al> Well the problem is because this code will need to be reused for about 20 different types of clothing. That will have different images etc for each type. I am trying to write it in a way that I can make some configuration changes at the top of the file that will allow for someone to easily update the template file
[12:31:55] <arc_> er no it doesn't actually
[12:32:45] <arc_> wait yeah it does. ok lol
[12:33:10] <arc_> i don't really see how assigning a class to these four images makes it any easier or harder for someone else to use this
[12:35:12] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/8kv9jw2b/13/
[12:35:28] <arc_> i added css so i could actually click on the images
[12:35:40] <arc_> you should obviously remove that
[12:37:29] <sk0al> ahh ok I think that is working better. Except you have to go back through and mouseover everything to get the correct images to update where they should be. need to get the on image to become the off image when another image is turned on
[12:38:40] <christech2> How do I wait for a class name to be generated before I fire a function?
[12:43:31] <rickthuc> christech2 you can do it on doc ready itself also
[12:45:51] <christech2> rickthuc: I have a script running with delay but the timing is unpredictable. So instead of delaying, I want to check for that certain class name (this is when everything's done loading) to be generated before I fire my function.
[12:47:14] <christech2> I'm trying to make my script wait for that class name. Is this possible?
[12:47:37] <rickthuc> then do a window.load or see if that script has a callback to execute after the script has finished loading, most do have
[12:48:40] <christech2> BTW, this class name is generated by JS on click.
[12:58:13] <rickthuc> how can i check if a div is on the top of viewport?
[13:09:37] <graphettion> Hey all. I was wanting to make 3 states (first one is static, second one is hover, third is active) to an image. The hover keeps overriding the visited state when the mouse leaves. Is there any way to fix this? - https://jsfiddle.net/tbu34zLv/
[13:20:03] <gnarf> christech2: not without MutationObserver support in the browser - not "clean"
[13:22:26] <gnarf> graphettion: do you have to use img src= -- could you swap background-image on an element using css instead?
[13:22:51] <graphettion> back
[13:23:25] <graphettion> I've tried the css way and haven't got anything so far. - https://jsfiddle.net/tbu34zLv/1/
[13:23:41] <gnarf> graphettion: are you doing it with multiple things, or just one thing?
[13:24:03] <graphettion> multiple things?
[13:24:07] <graphettion> just 3 pictures for the 3 states
[13:24:35] <gnarf> on this one thing, or are there going to be multiple of these on the page?
[13:24:49] <graphettion> oh, just one page
[13:24:50] <christech2> graphettion: Was playing with your code, how about this? https://jsfiddle.net/tbu34zLv/2/
[13:25:35] <graphettion> Yeah, I think my code is wrong. It doesn't truly hover off/on on that one.
[13:29:41] <graphettion> But christech2 has the right idea
[13:32:13] <gnarf> graphettion: https://jsfiddle.net/tbu34zLv/3/ something like that?
[13:32:19] <gnarf> your images were kind of broken
[13:33:38] <graphettion> gnarf: perfect! You didn't even need the hover visited
[13:33:40] <graphettion> ty man!
[13:34:44] <gnarf> graphettion: well, without the .hover.visited - whichever you define last wins, so put .visited after if you want visited to override hover, and vice versa
[13:35:24] <graphettion> yeah, gotcha
[13:35:33] <graphettion> Thank you. This has been bugging me.
[14:16:37] <fakingfantastic> Is there a way to use an $.ajax promise in document.ready without blocking the main thread?
[14:25:46] <benlieb> how can I make the event passed to my blur(function(event){}) bubble?
[14:27:44] <AcidBeard> I'm not sure what you mean
[14:27:52] <rickthuc> is top and padding-top different in terms of spacing
[14:29:11] <AcidBeard> top applies space above the element, padding-top makes the element tller by adding space between the content of the element and the top of the element
[14:55:46] <KEHN> hi
[15:02:35] <gnarf> benlieb: huh?
[15:03:20] <gnarf> rickthuc: padding is "inside"

[16:57:06] <ganeshaditya1> guys, I am struck at a problem. See I have a link and when it is clicked it should call function A which does some processing and changes the onclick event handler to function B, so that the next time that link is clicked function B should be called.
[16:58:18] <ganeshaditya1> I tried to add this line to the end of function A $('a#link_id').click(B()); But it calls B as soon as someone clicks on A instead of waiting for someone to click on the link the second time.
[16:58:43] <ganeshaditya1> I mean it calls the function B as soon as someone clicks on the link even the first time.
[17:00:23] <ganeshaditya1> This is what I want to happen. Clicks on link -> function A is called. -> changes the link's click handler to B. and the next time. Clicks on Link -> function B is called. -> changes the link's click handler to function A
[17:01:06] <ganeshaditya1> But this is what is happening. Clicks on Link -> function A is called -> function B is called ! Instead of waiting for the user to click on the link twice.
[17:11:03] <TheHackOps> ganeshaditya1, You could just have a global click counter
[17:11:04] <TheHackOps> or
[17:11:10] <TheHackOps> you could rebind the event handler
[17:11:51] <ganeshaditya1> how can I rebind the event handler? $().unbind('click') followed by $().click(function(){}); ???
[17:13:02] <TheHackOps> Honestly just make a counter
[17:13:12] <TheHackOps> Do you know how to structure your js to do so
[17:14:34] <ganeshaditya1> There must be a more elegant solution that counting clicks -_-
[17:14:35] <TheHackOps> MyApp: {Class_Name:{Member : 0, Events:{}}}
[17:15:13] <TheHackOps> I mean somewhere even if there was an OnSecondClick sorta thing
[17:15:18] <TheHackOps> has to have a counter
[17:15:28] <TheHackOps> You could do some shitty method chainign
[17:15:44] <TheHackOps> .on("click",function(ev){})
[17:16:03] <TheHackOps> then inside that you bind another click event handler
[17:16:26] <TheHackOps> which AFAIK would override the first event click handler
[17:16:36] <TheHackOps> But then you lose the binding of the first
[17:43:16] <acidjazz> so i wanna like
[17:43:46] <acidjazz> kauteee just spammed privmsg

[18:47:59] <Insentience> is there a way to .find() the results of a previous .find()?

[18:52:37] <kevireilly> I don't believe you can because it could be a security risk, but I may be remembering wrong
[18:54:27] <AcidBeard> You can do it, one sec
[18:54:41] <kevireilly> guess I'm mistaken, just looked.. was something else -- ahh file inputs
[18:55:39] <AcidBeard> Would be easier if you gave it an ID
[19:02:54] <rfc19> I want to have multiple divs that can be replaced with a sub-menu (green section). Things that will need to be replaced are the pink and red sections -- http://jsfiddle.net/jegqbuf4/ -- what's the best way to accomplish this? I've tried adding additional divs, making them absolute and hiding them but that messes with my layout.
[19:06:59] <AcidBeard> I don't see a red section...?
[19:09:11] <rfc19> AcidBeard: the one that says "image" its there if you scroll right
[19:09:14] <rfc19> "col3"
[19:11:52] <AcidBeard> Oh, ok, one sec
[19:25:32] <rfc19> AcidBeard: any luck?
[19:40:13] <AcidBeard> Sorry, stepped away
[19:44:02] <rfc19> AcidBeard: that's ok. I've tried using 'replaceWith' but that becomes a problem when I try scale out.
[19:44:08] <rfc19> I'd like to create the 'divs' myself
[19:44:36] <AcidBeard> http://jsfiddle.net/2uy161gr/1/
[19:45:11] <AcidBeard> See if that works for you
[19:48:57] <rfc19> AcidBeard: definitely works, however it wont scale well. I have a bit of text to go into each menu item so i was hoping I could do something like: <div id="item1">This is content1</div> <div id="item2">This is content2</div> and just trigger that with the menu values
