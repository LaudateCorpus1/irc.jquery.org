[01:26:16] <raul782> Hey guys, I'm not sure why this is not being triggered: window.onload = (typeof window.onload !== "function") ? loadTracker : function() { oldonload(); loadTracker(); };
[01:26:29] <raul782> I've tried this and the jquery version
[01:26:48] <raul782> but it's not getting triggered
[02:01:33] <Cork> raul782: why aren't you just using $('window').on('load', loadTracker); ?
[02:01:38] <Cork> opps
[02:01:44] <Cork> raul782: * why aren't you just using $(window).on('load', loadTracker); ?
[02:02:26] <Cork> you can have multiple event handlers if you stop using the old event property/attribute and instead use event listeners
[02:02:40] <Cork> (old as in dom0 instead of dom4)
[02:02:59] <raul782> Ic, thanks man, I'll try that
[02:04:13] <Cork> if you want it to be jquery independent you can use window.addEventListener('load', loadTracker);
[02:04:32] <Cork> it won't work in ie < 9, but it should hopefully not be a problem anymore
[03:29:22] <a_ok> Is there a performance difference between using "$(this).operation1(); $(this).operation2(); etc..." and "var jqElem = $(this); jqElem.operation1(); jqElem.operation2(); etc..."?
[03:29:47] <Cork> a_ok: they are identical
[03:29:54] <Cork> oh, wait sorry
[03:30:01] <Cork> yes there is a difference
[03:30:27] <Cork> $() will create a new object each time you call it, so it if nothing else will cause more gc
[03:30:45] <Cork> it normally isn't a significant difference though
[03:32:33] <a_ok> Cork: OK. I have a rather nasty situation where I have to loop over all ellements to see if its on fixed on the bottom of the page periodicaly so I want it to be as fast as possible unless it is truelly insignificant
[03:34:25] <a_ok> Cork: I think i am being silly here. I could just do a performance test. Thanks for answering though
[03:46:39] <Cork> a_ok: the performance you need to care about is the dom selectors
[03:46:57] <Cork> a_ok: if possible make a query and then keep the variable around and reuse it
[03:47:11] <Cork> that has much more relevance then this
[03:47:33] <a_ok> Cork: yeah that is not happening here so I think you are right
[03:48:22] <Cork> a_ok: also if you set the fixed to bottom from code it might be better to just have a trigger from when it changes the state
[03:48:27] <Cork> then you don't need to poll
[03:49:29] <a_ok> Cork: I wish I could. I am not in controle of the what crap goes to the bottom and when.
[03:49:56] <Cork> a_ok: do you know if they call jquery to do it?
[03:52:39] <a_ok> Cork: No. I have a few situations that I can test on but don't know it beforehand. The implementations might change (that is actualy why I am revisiting this problem). I have a full with bar on the bottom of the page that is required by law but scroll to top buttons, live chat sales/support stuff etc go over it or under it. I push them just above my bar
[03:53:08] <Cork> a_ok: you could use mutationobservers?
[03:53:46] <Cork> they are very chatty so i prefer to look for other solutions first, but it can handle this if you want
[03:54:00] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver#Example_usage
[03:54:24] <Cork> then you get notified as soon as the bottom half changes
[03:54:42] <a_ok> Cork: That might work have not used it before.
[03:54:53] <a_ok> Cork: Define bottom half
[03:55:11] <Cork> what ever element you choose to have as the observed element
[03:55:48] <Cork> was intentionally vague :)
[03:56:04] <a_ok> Cork: I will have to watch the entire page... I have no clue what element is on the bottom of the page
[03:56:28] <Cork> a_ok: so there isn't an element that holds it all??
[03:56:36] <Cork> that sounds kinda insane
[03:56:39] <a_ok> body perhaps?
[03:56:46] <Cork> that is the entire page
[03:56:49] <Cork> so a no
[03:57:25] <a_ok> The elements I have to work on do there own thing and the only way I know it is at the bottom is that they all use position:fixed bottom:0px;
[03:57:45] <Cork> and can be anywhere on the entire page?
[03:57:54] <Cork> this will be very expensive
[03:58:03] <a_ok> Yeah that Is inherent by position fixed
[03:58:18] <Cork> sure it might be using position fixed
[03:58:26] <Cork> but it feels like you could handle this in a better way
[03:58:34] <Cork> what are you trying to do exactly?
[03:58:43] <a_ok> Cork: Already described that
[03:58:59] <Cork> no, you described what you want to do, not why
[03:59:04] <a_ok> but it's ok I have things working no performance impact
[04:00:07] <Cork> if all it is about is to have other floating elements to go over it, you would just have to make sure all of them has a higher z-index
[04:00:14] <Cork> and that you can control from the css...
[04:32:07] <Guest80239> Hi, I'm having problem with "SCRIPT70: Permission denied" with 2.1.4. Bug #13936 (I only care about IE11). I have tried the fixes posted but none seem to work. Can anyone help me?
[04:33:12] <Cork> Guest80239: those errors are extreamly none telling
[04:33:19] <Cork> you would have to show what code you run when you get the error
[04:33:57] <Guest80239> I see. I'm, gonna try to put a simple example together
[04:34:09] <Cork> please use jsfiddle.net
[06:38:19] <IamTrying> https://jsfiddle.net/mjye7ax4/ - How to get the console.log(event.toElement.id, coords); after resize? (dragging works)
[06:40:09] <Cork> IamTrying: please start trying to formulate understandable questions...
[06:43:10] <IamTrying> Cork: when i drag the button_0 i get values from coords. But when i resize the button_0 i do not get the new: coords value
[06:43:26] <IamTrying> So how do i get the coords also while doing resize of the button_0 ?
[06:43:53] <Cork> uh, by binding the resize event?
[06:44:21] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/#event-resize
[06:46:40] <IamTrying> https://jsfiddle.net/mjye7ax4/1/ - You mean like this but it wont give me onResize the coords Cork
[06:47:06] <Cork> your binding resize on droppable...
[06:55:12] <IamTrying> https://jsfiddle.net/mjye7ax4/2/ - I applied the resizable and resize but there not getting anything.
[06:56:17] <IamTrying> you mean like this? https://jsfiddle.net/mjye7ax4/3/
[07:21:14] <IamTrying> https://jsfiddle.net/mjye7ax4/3/ - Line 6: Resize is giving me wrong x, y where line 16 gives the valid x, y.
[07:29:16] <Cork> IamTrying: it isn't resize giving you those, the browser is
[07:30:06] <Cork> THAT is what resize gives you https://jsfiddle.net/mjye7ax4/4/
[07:34:14] <IamTrying> Cork: $(".ibutton").resizable({  resize: function( event, ui ) {  //-- CAN - I - TRIGGER - $( "#parent" ).droppable ?? --- \\ }    });
[07:34:35] <Cork> why would you?
[07:34:49] <Cork> droppable is for when you drop the element not resize
[07:35:06] <IamTrying> Cork: can i force droppable on resize?
[07:35:37] <Cork> you can make a resizable element droppable on resize if that is what you ask sure
[07:35:43] <Cork> not sure why you would want to though
[07:38:26] <IamTrying> Cork: my $( "#parent" ).droppable({ event gives the accurate coords for x,y so i want "resizable element droppable on resize"
[07:38:33] <Cork> no it doens't
[07:38:39] <Cork> cause it isn't giving you anything
[07:39:08] <IamTrying> i mean that scope $( "#parent" ).droppable({ ... }); i have the most accurate values.
[07:39:12] <Cork> you call getBoundingClientRect() and it has ZERO relations to either resizable or droppable
[07:39:21] <Cork> so calling any of them won't change those values
[07:40:17] <Cork> instead you need to figure out why you get numbers that isn't what you expect
[07:40:26] <Cork> and either adjust what element you work with, or adjust the numbers
[07:40:38] <Cork> noting else will help you
[07:40:53] <Cork> (unless you're ok with using the ui provided information)
[07:42:47] <IamTrying> http://summerstyle.github.io/summer/ - I am making this. Where you can load a picture. And then apply box. Now when you drag or resize the rect box it show you x, y correctly in my case its not.
[07:43:51] <Cork> i recommend using the size information resizable provides you
[07:45:30] <IamTrying> OK - thank you
[07:48:03] <IamTrying> https://github.com/summerstyle/summer/blob/master/summerHTMLImageMapCreator.js#L36 - Here he used getOffset
[07:48:29] <IamTrying> And then: x : Math.round(boxCoords.left + window.pageXOffset)
[07:48:39] <IamTrying> OK - got it now.

[10:58:45] <munsking> Hello, i'm trying to read the input from a textbox on input (using .on("keypress") because i need to filter the enter character sometimes), but i can't get the last character with .val(), am i missing something?
[11:03:18] <munsking> even if i use event.currentTarget.value i get the "old" value, can i make "keypress" wait for the value to update somehow?
[11:16:22] <taplar> munsking: try keyup
[11:16:51] <munsking> taplar: d'oh, ofc, makes more sense, thanks
[11:29:50] <Nuage> anyone knows of a good php pdf generator that supports many stuff including canvas elements and javascript ?
[11:43:17] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[11:44:24] <randymarsh9> if i want to chain multiple callbacks together i just put an additional "function" inside the action right?
[11:44:47] <taplar> what action are you doing that needs a callback?
[11:45:28] <randymarsh9> like this:
[11:45:33] <randymarsh9> th
[11:45:36] <randymarsh9> fml
[11:45:43] <randymarsh9> $('#selector).action('click', function () { ... }, function () { ...})
[11:45:45] <randymarsh9> there
[11:46:05] <taplar> no
[11:46:13] <randymarsh9> taplar: css transition animations
[11:46:29] <randymarsh9> i want to play them in a certain order
[11:46:29] <taplar> you'd do one function there and you could call other functions sequentially inside that method
[11:46:50] <randymarsh9> ahh
[11:46:52] <randymarsh9> so wait
[11:47:13] <taplar> $().on(event, function(){ method1(); method2(); method3(); });
[11:48:52] <randymarsh9> taplar: more like this right?
[11:48:55] <randymarsh9>  $('#selector').action('something', function () { $('#selector').action('something', function () { ... });
[11:49:37] <taplar> no
[11:49:39] <randymarsh9> lol
[11:49:42] <taplar> i just showed you what you'd do
[11:50:28] <randymarsh9> ok let me try your way
[12:04:41] <randymarsh9> taplar: i still can't get it
[12:04:53] <randymarsh9> here's what i'm trying to do
[12:05:12] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/161vfkbs/
[12:05:34] <taplar> do you understand what bind() does?
[12:05:42] <randymarsh9> i want the icon to get small, then big then small
[12:05:48] <taplar> bind() is the same as on()*
[12:05:48] <randymarsh9> taplar: not really
[12:06:06] <randymarsh9> so i can replace bind with on?
[12:06:15] <taplar> you should use on() instead of bind() as bind() is just a wrapper, but that's not your issue
[12:06:19] <taplar> what does on() do?
[12:06:26] <randymarsh9> on an action?
[12:06:38] <taplar> explain that more
[12:06:50] <randymarsh9> like, "when this happens" do this
[12:07:00] <randymarsh9> or no
[12:07:03] <randymarsh9> ?
[12:07:04] <taplar> yes, you are creating an event binding
[12:07:14] <taplar> which will execute for that event on that element, -in the future-
[12:07:40] <taplar> so if you ar expecting immediate evocation of that logic ....
[12:07:58] <randymarsh9> not expecting immediate evocation
[12:08:06] <randymarsh9> i'm expecting it to do them in order, 1 by 1
[12:08:22] <randymarsh9> so once the transition completes, then get bigger, then when that completes, get smaller again
[12:08:39] <randymarsh9> that's how i was interpreting it
[12:08:52] <taplar> this isn't going to work like that
[12:09:00] <randymarsh9> why not
[12:09:17] <taplar> you don't want to create bindings inside other bindings
[12:09:24] <randymarsh9> ok
[12:09:26] <taplar> you are going to create duplicate bindings out the ass
[12:09:29] <taplar> one sec
[12:09:32] <randymarsh9> lol
[12:10:19] <randymarsh9> ok that's why i was asking about callbacks but i still don't fully understand the syntax of that either
[12:12:15] <hellyeah> syntax of what?
[12:12:23] <hellyeah> event?
[12:12:32] <randymarsh9> hellyeah: multiple callbacks
[12:12:47] <hellyeah> is that possible?
[12:12:49] <randymarsh9> if i want to chain events together, i'm not 100% sure how to do that
[12:12:55] <hellyeah> hmm i dnd t use that so far
[12:13:02] <hellyeah> well
[12:13:13] <hellyeah> afaik you dont use two events together
[12:13:25] <hellyeah> you may chain it
[12:13:31] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/161vfkbs/1/
[12:13:50] <randymarsh9> taplar: yours works!!
[12:14:12] <taplar> ask if you have any questions about it
[12:14:15] <randymarsh9> crap i don't understand that code though
[12:14:23] <hellyeah> thats nice
[12:14:38] <taplar> it's using two classes to identify the state of the process
[12:14:42] <hellyeah> simple method
[12:14:51] <hellyeah> adding and removing class
[12:14:56] <hellyeah> and do some transition
[12:14:59] <taplar> since all the transitions invoke those events that are caught, you use the class to know what to do
[12:15:42] <taplar> though something as simple as this could probably be done with some CSS steps
[12:15:48] <randymarsh9> never used addClass action before so it's confusing to me
[12:16:03] <randymarsh9> .Class
[12:16:03] <taplar> 'method'  not action
[12:16:10] <randymarsh9> ok method
[12:16:54] <hellyeah> can i use touch event while doing mobile website
[12:16:57] <hellyeah> ?
[12:17:07] <randymarsh9> taplar: i'll have to read more about those methods to understand how you did that but that's exactly what i was trying to do
[12:17:17] <randymarsh9> taplar: thank you!!
[12:17:19] <taplar> touch events are pretty crucial to mobile development
[12:17:35] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/acvahx9m/10/
[12:17:40] <hellyeah> i have something like that
[12:17:56] <hellyeah> and in mobile it is not possible to see al text at once
[12:18:11] <hellyeah> so i will give user an option to scroll down with touch event
[12:18:28] <hellyeah> those icons at the bottom keep there everytime
[12:18:49] <hellyeah> you just scroll textContainer for example
[12:18:53] <hellyeah> is it a good idea?
[12:18:54] <taplar> users can pan down on mobile devices
[12:19:06] <hellyeah> pan down rightr
[12:19:06] <taplar> you don't need custom touch events for that
[12:19:28] <hellyeah> but i will hide some contents with overflow
[12:19:33] <hellyeah> still not necessary
[12:20:02] <taplar> if you are hiding overflow then yes you'd have to handle for showing the additional information
[12:20:34] <hellyeah> i dont think i can show all text some mobile devices are really small
[12:20:46] <taplar> why hide it though?
[12:21:58] <hellyeah> this kinda long html page https://spinningcat.github.io/blog/
[12:22:14] <hellyeah> you click items and you see the content
[12:22:20] <hellyeah> but content is kinda long too
[12:22:23] <taplar> so?
[12:22:26] <taplar> they can pan
[12:22:31] <taplar> just like i can scroll in my browser
[12:24:30] <hellyeah> yeah
[12:24:35] <hellyeah> thats true
[12:24:44] <hellyeah> but i want to put those icons at the bottom
[12:24:55] <hellyeah> you see github, jsfiddle, linkedin icon right
[12:25:02] <hellyeah> do you think it is usable
[12:25:09] <taplar> on the bottom how?
[12:25:37] <taplar> on the bottom of the window or bottom of the page?
[12:25:57] <hellyeah> bottom of the page
[12:25:57] <hellyeah> you see right
[12:25:59] <hellyeah> sec
[12:26:14] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/acvahx9m/10/
[12:26:55] <taplar> if you want to put them on the top or bottom of the page that's pretty basic
[12:27:16] <taplar> putting them on the top or bottom of the window is just using css to position: fixed it
[12:28:23] <hellyeah> yea
[12:28:26] <hellyeah> i used flexbox
[12:28:39] <hellyeah> my point is i want to hide content to use icons at the bottom
[12:28:53] <hellyeah> hope it is understandable
[12:28:57] <taplar> no
[12:29:38] <taplar> are you saying you want to make it so that the users don't have to scroll down very far to get to the icons?
[12:30:22] <hellyeah> icon has its own div
[12:30:37] <hellyeah> and text has its own div
[12:30:50] <hellyeah> and they respect each other
[12:30:52] <taplar> i'm asking about your desired result. not what you currently have
[12:30:52] <hellyeah> there will be long text there
[12:30:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[12:31:08] <hellyeah> ah
[12:31:09] <hellyeah> sorry
[12:31:13] <hellyeah> my mistake
[12:31:16] <hellyeah> hmm
[12:31:20] <hellyeah> okey i got my mistake
[12:31:35] <hellyeah> putting those icon to bottom and do position:fixed
[12:31:42] <hellyeah> it will solve the issue no need to hide content
[12:31:58] <taplar> that's one solution, sure
[12:32:21] <hellyeah> do you have suggestion?
[12:32:35] <taplar> nah, that works fine
[12:33:09] <hellyeah> this is my first experience with mobile
[12:34:41] <taplar> i'd suggest reading up on css media queries if you are unfamiliar with them.
[12:35:08] <hellyeah> yeah i work with media queries today
[12:35:12] <hellyeah> i read a bit
[12:35:52] <hellyeah> wow i wass really noob
[12:35:57] <hellyeah> not i am decent thats nice
[12:36:11] <taplar> brb
[12:36:17] <hellyeah> taplar:  you are really kind and generous guy
[12:36:19] <hellyeah> take care
[12:38:57] <MassDebates> yeah he's pretty cool.
[12:39:15] <MassDebates> Y'know he once made something that was like a cloth
[12:39:18] <MassDebates> and it worked well in javascript
[12:39:21] <MassDebates> but not well in codepen.
[12:39:27] <MassDebates> er jsfiddle* not javascript
[12:39:40] <MassDebates> and he doesn't remember what it is. I've been searching for it ever since he showed it to me like a yaer ago
[12:40:35] <hellyeah> may i help you :D
[12:43:46] <taplar> lol, cloth?
[12:46:12] <hellyeah> what is cloth btw
[12:46:36] <taplar> cloth is fabric, if you are familiar with that word
[12:47:15] <taplar> like, clothing.  clothing is made from sewn cloth
[12:47:37] <sonu_nk> https://regex101.com/r/yqSSVb/1
[12:47:45] <sonu_nk> any help for regex ?
[12:48:03] <taplar> OT for the room, but what's the issue with it?
[12:48:06] <sonu_nk> i dont want space at start, end but allow in middle
[12:48:37] <MassDebates> There's a regex room iirc
[12:48:53] <MassDebates> Try #regex maybe
[12:48:55] <sonu_nk> seems that is ghost room or light house...
[12:48:58] <sonu_nk> no one there
[12:49:04] <hellyeah> i got it
[12:49:04] <hellyeah> like pants?
[12:49:20] <taplar> pants are made from a type of cloth
[12:49:22] <MassDebates> 349 users there right now sonu_nk
[12:49:41] <sonu_nk> hehehe.. no one replying.. i know all are there..
[12:50:11] <taplar> i feel like this regex is correct
[12:50:13] <MassDebates> I would recommend you say !tuts in there. It may be answerable by the automated command
[12:50:18] <taplar> it just looks like it is multiline matching
[12:50:40] <MassDebates> just match any space next to a newline.
[12:50:44] <sonu_nk> yes.. if it will not allow end space then my work done.
[12:51:01] <sonu_nk> !tuts
[12:51:05] <taplar> there isn't an end space
[12:51:11] <taplar> there is a new line
[12:52:00] <taplar> otherwise put that [^\s] on the end of it
[12:53:11] <snover> \S is the opposite of \s
[12:53:11] <taplar> https://regex101.com/r/yqSSVb/2
[12:53:38] <taplar> ah, instead of doing the ^ ?
[12:53:43] <snover> yes.
[12:53:43] <taplar> makes sense
[12:54:42] <taplar> https://regex101.com/r/yqSSVb/3
[12:56:03] <sonu_nk> taplar, seems woking
[12:56:30] <taplar> though if you trimmed the string first you wouldn't have to worry about that, :D
[12:59:11] <hellyeah> ne is so solve
[12:59:13] <sonu_nk> taplar, how can i trim the string when anyone typing it ?
[12:59:31] <hellyeah> in js?
[12:59:34] <hellyeah> in jquery
[13:00:11] <taplar> you can trim any string that you can get a reference to
[13:00:13] <sonu_nk> jquery
[13:00:20] <hellyeah> $.trim
[13:00:23] <taplar> "whatever string".trim()
[13:00:28] <taplar> it's js, not jquery
[13:00:42] <hellyeah> $.trim is not jquery?
[13:00:50] <taplar> you don't need jquery to trim a string
[13:00:58] <sonu_nk> that i also know . but is user is typing and he adding space in start then how to just remove the space that time..
[13:01:00] <hellyeah> humm
[13:01:06] <hellyeah> this one exist
[13:01:10] <hellyeah> i keep that in my mind
[13:01:15] <taplar> oh, you mean update their input field to take it out?
[13:01:27] <sonu_nk> taplar, yes same
[13:01:32] <sonu_nk> at same time
[13:01:47] <hellyeah> you need event for that i think
[13:01:48] <taplar> personally i'd avoid that.  changing the input value while they are typing can be a jankey user experience
[13:02:18] <hellyeah> taplar knows better i am sure you can use change event and do triggering each time event is triggered
[13:02:29] <taplar> 'input' event
[13:02:41] <taplar> and yeah, you could update the value as they are typing like that
[13:02:55] <taplar> but like i said, it can be bad user experience if they are typing and their cursor shifts on them
[13:04:36] <taplar> you might could do a keydown approach though and check if their cursor is at the beginning or end, and if it is a space cancel that event
[13:04:56] <taplar> little more work, but would definitely be a better experience than updating
[13:06:13] <hellyeah> beginning and end that seems interesting
[13:16:33] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/fzqdyzwc/ ruff implementation
[13:20:19] <ltorvalds024> when it is good time to calculate the height of an element?
[13:21:48] <taplar> after it has been drawn to the page
[13:22:21] <ltorvalds024> taplar: you mean on $(document).ready() ?
[13:23:48] <taplar> what type of element are you trying to get the height of?
[13:26:57] <CarlenWhite> Using a jQuery-alike in Node.js called Cheerio to pull information from HTML. And I've managed to traverse the document to where I need to be, but I need to select all the p children until a div element.
[13:28:16] <CarlenWhite> At the moment I have it as `var tableHell = $('table:first-of-type').find('table:first-of-type')[...]` `tableHell.find('p').nextUntil('div').addBack()` but it still pull's the p elements after the div.
[13:29:47] <CarlenWhite> Derp. I think I see my problem...
[13:30:18] <ltorvalds024> taplar: div
[13:30:30] <hellyeah> javascript has getComputedStyle() to get width, heighti margin etc.
[13:30:39] <CarlenWhite> `tableHell.find('p:first-of-type').nextUntil('div').addBack()`
[13:30:56] <taplar> ltorvalds024: then so long as there aren't any images in that div, probably fine to do it in the ready()
[13:31:15] <ltorvalds024> taplar: is it possible before that?
[13:31:26] <taplar> i wouldn't
[13:31:32] <taplar> the dom hasn't fully loaded yet
[13:51:20] <CarlenWhite> Trying to get the text content of the elements I selected, but using `.text()` doesn't add newlines for each tag. I thought I could work around this by selecting everything and doing a `.each()` to combine the texts with newlines, but that caused a 'stutter'ing effect when it fetches the text twice when it traverses deeper.
[13:57:36] <simplymod> good day everyone :)
[13:58:13] <VeryBewitching> o/
[13:59:26] <grapheti> Hello all, trying to figure out how to keep the image in the middle while I zoom. Any ideas? - https://codepen.io/Graphettion/pen/ZJNLjJ
[13:59:34] <simplymod> today my sister in law contacted me because her website is marked as malicious by google. I did some research and found the jquery.js which seems a bit odd
[14:00:03] <simplymod> i compared it to the official version on jquery.org and it looks totally different, despite being the same version, 1.8.2
[14:02:11] <plamb> if i return a set of input elements will $(...).find('input:checked') return the checked element?
[14:05:38] <taplar> 'set of input elements' ?
[14:07:12] <hellyeah> is it checkbox or radiobox
[14:07:13] <hellyeah> ?
[14:07:31] <taplar> both are input
[14:08:27] <hellyeah> yeah but you can click multiple checkbox at a time but in radibox you can click only one if i know correctly
[14:08:35] <taplar> so?
[14:08:37] <hellyeah> if i remember correctly
[14:08:53] <hellyeah> so may be someone click two checkboxes and click submit button
[14:09:01] <hellyeah> and gives that two values together
[14:09:07] <taplar> submit buttons don't have a checked property
[14:09:11] <hellyeah> he may mean that with set of inputs
[14:09:38] <taplar> maybe wait for him to clarity, or ask him to clarify instead of thinking up possible problems?
[14:09:48] <hellyeah> thats right but you can find checked element with closest(), find()
[14:10:04] <hellyeah> i assume those checkboxes and submit button are under same container
[14:10:11] <hellyeah> i may be wrong
[14:10:14] <hellyeah> i just tried
[14:10:14] <hellyeah> :D
[14:10:36] <hellyeah> anyway i should go
[14:11:56] <taplar> plamb: can you go into more detail about how your 'set of inputs' relates to the jquery you provided?
[14:13:02] <plamb> sorry it was a radio
[14:13:06] <plamb> and it did work
[14:13:23] <taplar> are you sticking an array of elements inside $() ?
[14:13:47] <plamb> the selection returns a set of jquery elems yeah
[14:13:51] <plamb> an array
[14:13:57] <taplar> ?
[14:14:06] <taplar> $('someSelector') you mean?
[14:14:09] <plamb> yes
[14:14:13] <taplar> ok
[14:14:30] <robertmaxrees> fwiw that's not an array of elements.
[14:14:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:14:44] <plamb> would a
[14:14:52] <plamb> "jquery elem of jquery elems" be correct?
[14:14:58] <taplar> jquery element
[14:15:10] <taplar> or jquery object
[14:15:14] <taplar> they are inherently array "like"
[14:15:17] <plamb> overthinking it
[14:18:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.  just a jquery object.,
[14:53:46] <Randomage> Hello folks, quick issue, on event A I want to take a snapshot (not the image kind) of the values of a form, on event B I want to check if the current form values match with the snapshot, if they don't, prompt the user, and if they choose to revert, re-set the form to the old values.
[14:54:04] <Randomage> I have some solutions I can think of, but they all seem very clunky and inelegant.
[14:54:18] <Randomage> Like using serialize and unserializing.
[14:54:31] <Randomage> Can anyone think of something... good?
[14:56:59] <taplar> you could put the values at step A into data elements
[15:17:53] <plamb> does .find search through _all_ descendants for matches
[15:17:59] <plamb> or stop when it finds the first match
[15:18:04] <taplar> all
[15:20:12] <plamb> if i return a jquery object of all descendent 'input's into a var and then later want to pull the input thats ":checked" out of that object
[15:20:24] <plamb> would .find() do that or will it only look at descendent elements
[15:21:36] <taplar> filter()
[15:21:41] <plamb> ahh
[15:21:43] <plamb> of course
[15:21:50] <plamb> thanks
[15:27:56] <Randomage> I think you're thinking of .filter() maybe
[15:28:00] <Randomage> whoops
[15:28:05] <Randomage> window was scrolled up
[15:44:30] <coder7of9> i owuld like to make a div disappear into another div... so it shrinks into the other div as it vnishes (like into a button) so the user knows where it went and how tyo access it. does jquery offer anything like this.
[15:46:53] <MassDebates> well
[15:46:59] <coder7of9> like slideInto
[15:47:05] <MassDebates> With some simple class changes and some CSS magic, you can do it yourself!
[15:47:10] <MassDebates> Woo!
[15:47:36] <plamb> when i return a value from an event handler like this: https://api.jquery.com/event.result/ if i want to use that returned result later, do i put "var =" in front of the event handler?
[15:47:41] <MassDebates> jquery can help simplify the class changes that you'd essentially make in javascript yourself. since you're in #jquery it's likely you already have it loading on the page.
[15:47:58] <robertmaxrees> plamb you can't return values out of event handlers.
[15:48:01] <MassDebates> That being said, I suggest you bop on over to codepen or jsfiddle, crank out some example divs with some nice fancy dancy colors to tell what's what
[15:48:17] <robertmaxrees> oh weird.
[15:48:19] <MassDebates> And then try to see if you can come up with some good styles/transitions to make it happen
[15:48:29] <robertmaxrees> aaaah right event.result.
[15:48:37] <robertmaxrees> plamb you can't really use it later.
[15:48:43] <MassDebates> ?
[15:48:44] <MassDebates> He can't
[15:48:45] <MassDebates> ?
[15:48:49] <MassDebates> Can't he assign and store
[15:48:49] <coder7of9> thanks.... i was hoping it was already in jquery, but i can try
[15:49:10] <MassDebates> coder7of9:  there may be some extra, pre-written scripts out there, but honestly, this would be a really neat and fun exercise for you to do!
[15:49:13] <MassDebates> I bet you could od it.
[15:49:22] <coder7of9> plamb you can assign it to a class member or if you have to a global
[15:49:43] <coder7of9> yes if i can find time.. :)
[15:49:51] <robertmaxrees> plamb let's flip that around - why do you want to save the value?
[15:50:12] <plamb> well
[15:50:25] <MassDebates> coder7of9:  I think a good first step is getting the relevant elements down on a pen or fiddle.
[15:50:48] <plamb> basically in this event handler a value is used for something and i need to know what that value was at that moment in time in a later piece of code
[15:50:56] <MassDebates> coder7of9:  Then, if you're completely blanking out on how to proceed, maybe you can visit #css and ask about hwo to do this sort of thing.
[15:51:03] <plamb> im probably over complicating it
[15:51:06] <robertmaxrees> plamb heh
[15:51:11] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us a basic example?
[15:51:14] <MassDebates> wait
[15:51:14] <MassDebates> What
[15:51:25] <robertmaxrees> having to store state like that sounds like code smell to me.
[15:51:27] <coder7of9> thanks... maybe easier in css3
[15:51:53] <MassDebates> coder7of9:  You'll have to use some of the newer stuff in CSS simply by the raw fact that you want to have the visual act in that way.
[15:52:03] <plamb> i can try
[15:52:18] <MassDebates> coder7of9:  Nobody can ehlp you until you get a pen link for them, first.
[15:52:22] <plamb> yeah i think its probably simpler than what im conceiving of
[15:52:28] <coder7of9> thaks
[15:52:34] <coder7of9> thanks.
[15:57:14] <coder7of9> likethis as a start: http://jsfiddle.net/h7tuehmo/3/
[16:03:22] <plamb> alright robertmaxrees this is a nasty fiddle but
[16:03:25] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/plamb/4sawg130/12/
[16:03:38] <plamb> the two radio inputs at the top
[16:03:54] <robertmaxrees> you just wanna know which one was clicked?
[16:03:56] <plamb> their value impacts the clustersize/pricing of the recommendations below (after you slide the slider)
[16:04:01] <robertmaxrees> also: your html is invalid.
[16:04:05] <plamb> im trying to account for the case where
[16:04:24] <plamb> someone slides the slider and then decides to change the value of the two inputs above
[16:04:47] <robertmaxrees> so why do you need to store the value?
[16:04:49] <plamb> and i wanted to update the recommended prices if someone changes one of those values AFTER they've already slid the slider
[16:04:55] <robertmaxrees> why not just grab it again?
[16:05:17] <plamb> well so for the clusterSize, i need to subtract what it originally was, and add whatever the new value is now
[16:05:22] <plamb> unless there is some easier way
[16:05:35] <robertmaxrees> you just grab it on change of the inputs.
[16:05:35] <plamb> so i was trying to return the original value when the slider was slid
[16:05:39] <robertmaxrees> don't need to store it anywhere.
[16:05:43] <robertmaxrees> you can just query the value.
[16:06:15] <plamb> okay, but say i have "non-HA" selected when i get my first set of recommended instances; the value of that is "1"
[16:06:25] <plamb> "1" has already been added to the recommended instances once
[16:06:37] <plamb> now i switch it to "HA" whose value is "2"
[16:06:51] <plamb> so i need to subtract the "1" from all recommended instances, and add "2"
[16:07:15] <robertmaxrees> oooorrrrr
[16:07:22] <robertmaxrees> you need the original "base" data and then rerender using that.
[16:07:29] <plamb> right
[16:07:32] <plamb> that would work too
[16:07:45] <plamb> hmm
[16:07:50] <robertmaxrees> which is going to be far more reliable and less bug-prome.
[16:07:56] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to manage state.
[16:08:39] <plamb> its almost like i need to run the function inside the #memoryRange event handler again
[16:08:46] <plamb> so maybe abstract that into a function
[16:11:42] <robertmaxrees> (Shrug) that's your call.  i just wouldn't suggest that you try to manage what the value once was and all that.
[16:11:54] <plamb> yeah
[16:12:17] <plamb> it should have been its own function anyway just for readability
[16:14:09] <robertmaxrees> +++ always.
[16:45:44] <jak92700> hi all

[17:04:43] <taplar> lol i was staring at it thinking...... that looks stupid
[17:04:53] <grapheti> lol
[17:38:39] <mark4> so im havng some minor issues with some noob js/jquery code ive been developing, its not working in a consistent manner
[17:41:07] <robertmaxrees> show us?
[17:44:08] <mark4> kk i can show you the live site then paste the JS somewhere
[17:44:15] <mark4> solon.x10host.com
[17:44:22] <robertmaxrees> err
[17:44:31] <robertmaxrees> can you show us an isolated case?
[17:44:37] <mark4> not really
[17:44:45] <mark4> the live site IS the isolated case
[17:44:53] <robertmaxrees> so what's the bug?
[17:45:36] <mark4> i have a horizontal menu that rearranges itself based on width of the browser using media queries.  but i dont want more than 2 rows to display.
[17:46:08] <mark4> the js redefines that part of the dom to show only the currently selected items row and the next one (or previous if no next).
[17:46:27] <mark4> on mouse over the entier menu expands but when you mose off it does not always collapse
[17:46:42] <robertmaxrees> soooo first problem: you want to use css to do this.
[17:46:45] <robertmaxrees> not js.
[17:46:54] <mark4> no i did it in JS to learn JS lol
[17:47:04] <mark4> and im not proficient enough with css to do it in css
[17:47:10] <robertmaxrees> then learn?
[17:47:19] <robertmaxrees> it's really the smarter way to do it.
[17:47:20] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[17:47:22] <mark4> which is why im asking for help to understand what i did wrong?
[17:47:26] <mark4> i know it is
[17:47:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:48:00] <robertmaxrees> "hey i know this isn't the right approach but i'd rather do it this way and be told what i did wrong"
[17:48:08] <mark4> my car has a flat tire can you tell me how to fix it? i drive a pinto... oh.. you need to be driving a toyota!
[17:48:11] <mark4> not very helpful lol
[17:48:17] <robertmaxrees> bad analogy.
[17:48:40] <robertmaxrees> "i'm trying to use a vice grip to change my tire.  i know i should use a tire iron but i'd rather learn to do it this way."
[17:48:45] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[17:48:47] <robertmaxrees> link to the js?
[17:48:51] <mark4> no. im doing it this way to learn JS. i am also learning css and have no problems removing the js to redo it in css. this is an experiment
[17:49:13] <mark4> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/QWUQCM5Me1wwoz6Tczd2/
[17:49:25] <robertmaxrees> why learn to do it the wrong way?
[17:49:38] <mark4> im learning JS and jquery
[17:49:51] <robertmaxrees> then why not solve problems those are built to solve?
[17:49:51] <Al_nz1> hiya Robdgreat
[17:49:55] <Al_nz1> hiya robertmaxrees
[17:49:56] <mark4> without using jquery ui though thats not out of the question for later either
[17:50:05] <robertmaxrees> hey Al_nz1
[17:50:11] <mark4> pretend css does not exist plz lol
[17:50:24] <robertmaxrees> mark4 (sigh)
[17:50:37] <energizer> How do I get this to work? https://jsfiddle.net/tc2s17v9/
[17:51:07] <mark4> this is a invented problem to have something to do with javascript. i dont care if its done more efficiently in x86 assembler, im doing it in JS to learn JS and jquery
[17:51:17] <energizer> er https://jsfiddle.net/tc2s17v9/1/
[17:51:33] <robertmaxrees> good luck mark4 :)
[17:51:59] <robertmaxrees> energizer start by linking jquery like this: https://i.imgur.com/o1sdPlp.png
[17:52:02] <mark4> so if someone who does not have a problem helping could take a look at the JS and tell me why its not acting in a consistent manner it would be appreciated
[17:52:16] <Al_nz1> in this question on SO - what is '#summernote' ?
[17:52:30] <mark4> instead of being anal retentive with "your doing it the wrong way" when i know there are better ways of doing this kthxbai
[17:52:33] <Al_nz1> is it a id?
[17:52:45] <robertmaxrees> mark4 no reason to be insulting.
[17:53:02] <robertmaxrees> energizer also: why not do your event binding in JS?
[17:53:10] <mark4> well i told you, this is not intended to be "THE" solution. its a path to learning
[17:53:33] <mark4> and your "great! have fun!"
[17:53:44] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) you asked for advice.  maybe somebody else can help.
[17:53:54] <robertmaxrees> in the meantime, try to be a little more civil :) Thanks!
[17:54:06] <mark4> no. i asked for help in understanding why my code does not act in a consistent manner
[17:54:33] <mark4> so not only did you not understand the nature of the problem but you didnt even bother to read what i asked :/
[17:54:37] <energizer> robertmaxrees: ok https://jsfiddle.net/tc2s17v9/3/
[17:54:51] <robertmaxrees> mark4 i did read it.  and i gave advice based on a lot of experience.  it's no big deal.
[17:54:57] <robertmaxrees> somebody else may come along and offer help.
[17:55:14] <robertmaxrees> energizer i';m guessing part of your problem has to do with return values from that chain of commands.
[17:55:19] <robertmaxrees> *methods
[17:55:46] <mark4> ty for the advice but as i told you, im aware that this is not an optimal way of doing this. there are better solutions to the same problem.
[17:56:07] <mark4> meanwhile my question was "why is this code not being consistent in how it performs"
[17:56:23] <mark4> so my pinto/toyota parallel is spot on
[17:56:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:56:38] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[17:56:43] <robertmaxrees> energizer also: your markup is invalid.
[17:56:47] <robertmaxrees> which will cause other headaches.
[17:56:55] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: have you heard of thymeleaf?
[17:57:00] <energizer> robertmaxrees: you mean its missing tbody?
[17:57:12] <robertmaxrees> energizer you're missing a td./
[17:57:18] <robertmaxrees> trs can only have tds as children.
[17:57:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/tc2s17v9/4/
[17:57:48] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 I'
[17:57:52] <robertmaxrees> *i've heard of it.  never used it.
[17:58:44] <energizer> robertmaxrees: ah right. How do I get the new row to be blank (unchecked, no input, default select)?
[17:58:59] <energizer> (that was my actual reason for comnig here heh)
[18:00:21] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ok - I have a question about binding a wysiwyg package to thymeleaf. If you dont mind taking a look
[18:00:38] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 ask to the channel.  if somebody can help, they will.
[18:02:19] <robertmaxrees> energizer well, you've got a bit of a problem with that.
[18:02:56] <robertmaxrees> you have two "safe" options.  one way is to render out with a "default" value of some kind in a data attribute and then reset all inputs back to that value.
[18:03:11] <robertmaxrees> oooorrrrr just stick the template in the page as a js string and just render that out to the page.
[18:04:05] <energizer> robertmaxrees: how would i do the first row?
[18:04:16] <robertmaxrees> literally the way i said.
[18:04:40] <robertmaxrees> though https://jsfiddle.net/tc2s17v9/6/ is way cleaner.
[18:04:42] <robertmaxrees> just a thought ;)
[18:07:19] <energizer> robertmaxrees: sweet, thanks!
[18:07:31] <robertmaxrees> energizer yep.
[18:07:35] <robertmaxrees> also:
[18:07:38] <robertmaxrees> what do you need the IDs for?
[18:07:56] <energizer> <input type="submit">
[18:08:41] <energizer> so i dont need them now, i was just using them for that
[18:09:01] <energizer> but i will need some way to identify the individual rows
[18:09:18] <robertmaxrees> are you doing ajax of some kind?
[18:10:15] <energizer> i havent come to a conclusion on how the submission should work
[18:10:21] <energizer> what are your thoughts?
[18:10:26] <robertmaxrees> that totally depends.
[18:10:33] <robertmaxrees> on what your needs are.
[18:10:41] <energizer> no ajax should be needed
[18:10:55] <robertmaxrees> so you're fine with the page reloading after each submit?
[18:11:04] <energizer> yes
[18:11:19] <energizer> i mean there should only be one submit
[18:11:24] <robertmaxrees> for the whole page?
[18:11:27] <energizer> yes
[18:11:38] <robertmaxrees> this is going to get more complex then.
[18:12:25] <robertmaxrees> there are two approaches.  for both, you'll wrap basically that whole table in a form.  then make sure each "group" of inputs shares some kind of common ID within their name./
[18:12:51] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/tc2s17v9/7/ something like this.
[18:13:43] <robertmaxrees> the other option is to stop the submit event, grab all the data, and stuff it into a JSON array in a hidden input, then just submit a form containing only that.
[18:13:47] <robertmaxrees> brb
[18:13:59] <Al_nz1> I need to get some text from a database into the a WYSIWYG on a form. I am using thymeleaf which for example <input type="text" th:input="*{episode.narrative}"> --- when processed on the server generates <input type="text" name=episode.narrative>some value from db<  --- now I need to bind summernote - a wysiwyg text area to my thymeleaf. I have started with <div class="textarea narrative"
[18:14:00] <Al_nz1> contenteditable="true" th:value="*{episode.narrative}"> which generates a value="" tag - and summernote would ordinarily display the content with $('.narrative').summernote('code'); - I am not sure if it is possible to bind these two tecnologies together?
[18:21:56] <robertmaxrees> back
[18:22:24] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 well
[18:22:38] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 is thymeleaf a server-side thing?
[18:27:20] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes
[18:28:23] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:28:32] <robertmaxrees> so there's a super basic concept you gotta wrap your head around.
[18:28:32] <robertmaxrees> so.
[18:28:42] <robertmaxrees> thymeleaf is server-side, right?  which means it's pumping out html.
[18:28:44] <robertmaxrees> following so far?
[18:29:00] <Al_nz1> totally understand that bit
[18:29:04] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:29:17] <robertmaxrees> so the client-side JS only interacts with the HTML, right?
[18:29:39] <Al_nz1> totally
[18:30:01] <robertmaxrees> so that means the js never interacts with thymeleaf directly.
[18:30:22] <robertmaxrees> so you're not connect your js to thymeleaf since they live in two distinct areas and those areas don't really cross over.
[18:30:42] <robertmaxrees> *connecting
[18:32:01] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: totally get that - however thymeleaf needs to generate a "tag" that will bind an object to a input. I assume textarea's can be bound in some fashion
[18:32:14] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:32:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:32:37] <robertmaxrees> all thymeleaf is doing is pumping out HTML tho.
[18:32:38] <robertmaxrees> right?
[18:32:50] <Al_nz1> yes thats exactly what it does
[18:32:56] <robertmaxrees> so you just gotta make sure the resultant html is whatever it needs to be.
[18:33:05] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yeah get that
[18:33:11] <energizer> robertmaxrees: so how would i then label each field with its row number? https://jsfiddle.net/tc2s17v9/10/
[18:33:13] <robertmaxrees> so then where's the disconnect?
[18:33:45] <robertmaxrees> energizer putting a number on the row won't get sent server-side.
[18:33:46] <energizer> or do the json thing (which actually seems like it should be simpler, but idk)
[18:34:34] <robertmaxrees> your number would be apart of the input namess.
[18:34:36] <robertmaxrees> *names
[18:34:57] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: this might explain it better than I can and I think has the solution : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27839870/access-textarea-with-spring-thymeleaf
[18:35:34] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I can insert my text into the text area on load - but its not getting sent back to the database
[18:35:36] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 your question was "I am not sure if
[18:35:36] <robertmaxrees> it is possible to bind these two tecnologies together?
[18:36:05] <robertmaxrees> is thymeleaf also doing some kind of ORM for you?
[18:36:24] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes
[18:36:47] <Al_nz1> I have managed to set the value of the text area - but its not going back with the form data
[18:39:48] <robertmaxrees> okay, so thymeleaf isn't just a templating engine.  sounds like they expect some attribute value somewhere for that to work correctly.
[18:41:35] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I think I got it to go ....
[18:41:42] <robertmaxrees> cool
[18:53:23] <catbadger> hey all
[18:53:29] <energizer> robertmaxrees: So I guess now I need a way to make sure all the fields in each new row get assigned a name with the corresponding row number when they appear. Is there a nice way to do that? https://jsfiddle.net/tc2s17v9/11/
[18:55:25] <robertmaxrees> have you tried anything?
[18:55:56] <energizer> robertmaxrees: terrible stuff like str.replace, but i cant imagine thats the right way
[18:56:11] <robertmaxrees> that's roughly how I'd do it heh.
[18:56:22] <catbadger> energizer: try using a for loop and insert your iterator into the name.
[18:56:33] <catbadger> ;)
[18:56:40] <robertmaxrees> catbadger he needs to set it based on the current number on the page ;)
[18:56:52] <catbadger> ooh, fancy: )
[18:58:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/tc2s17v9/12/ i'd do something like this.
[18:58:25] <robertmaxrees> unless you're gonna get into more client-side templating, in which case I'd find a templating engine.
[18:58:51] <catbadger> +1
[19:08:04] <energizer> robertmaxrees: thats pretty nice, thanks
[19:09:51] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: if I have a group of 10 questions, and when all 10 are answered I want to have a total score filled out do I just have to loop over all questions after each.change or is there a better way?
[19:11:10] <robertmaxrees> each.change???
[19:11:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd just use $('.question').on('change', function() {});
[19:12:00] <robertmaxrees> dunno what the each would be fore.
[19:12:01] <robertmaxrees> *for
[19:12:57] <Al_nz1> if any question is not answered - then the score cannot be calculated. So if you answered all 10 questions the score is calculated - if any are left blank the score is "incomplete"
[19:13:33] <robertmaxrees> so you want input validation as well?
[19:13:39] <Al_nz1> so you cant attempt to calc the score until all 10 are answered, hence every time a value changed I need to loop over the lot to see if they have all been answered
[19:13:55] <Al_nz1> well they are dropdowns so its either 1 0 or blank
[19:14:05] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[19:14:10] <robertmaxrees> so you want input validation as well?
[19:15:57] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 ^
[19:16:18] <robertmaxrees> 'cause like... https://jsfiddle.net/wdwLdLfn/
[19:32:33] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: what were you trying to show in that fiddle?
[19:36:12] <robertmaxrees> load it and click "submit" while it's on the "select one" option.
[19:43:47] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ok - but for my form - they dont have to answer all questions - people are allowed to refuse some
[19:44:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:44:42] <robertmaxrees> wat
[19:44:51] <robertmaxrees> so some are required?
[19:45:07] <robertmaxrees> because what you said was "if any question is not answered - then the score cannot be calculated. So if you answered all 10 questions the score is calculated - if any are left blank the score is "incomplete""
[19:48:11] <robertmaxrees> so which is it?
