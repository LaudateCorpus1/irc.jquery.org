[04:30:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:30:46] <Anamol_> xD
[04:31:45] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[04:32:25] <Anamol_> its not working on fiddle
[04:32:26] <Anamol_> :(
[04:32:31] <robertmaxrees> just share it out.
[04:32:33] <robertmaxrees> it's fine.
[04:33:23] <Anamol_> its working on codepen
[04:33:29] <Anamol_> can i share codepens link?
[04:33:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:33:37] <Anamol_> xD
[04:33:39] <robertmaxrees> do you want help or...?
[04:33:45] <Anamol_> i want help
[04:33:46] <Anamol_> i m new
[04:33:49] <Anamol_> sorry for the mess
[04:33:52] <robertmaxrees> then share
[04:33:57] <Anamol_> http://jsfiddle.net/xawo6bkL/1/
[04:34:45] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?>
[04:34:57] <Anamol_> when i click read more button
[04:35:01] <Anamol_> the function i wrote is
[04:35:12] <Anamol_> working for all divs
[04:35:18] <robertmaxrees> but you want it just for the one?
[04:35:21] <Anamol_> yes
[04:35:29] <robertmaxrees> you want a Contextual Selector.
[04:35:30] <robertmaxrees> so
[04:35:34] <Anamol_> yeah
[04:35:42] <robertmaxrees> in the click handler, $(this) is the thing you clicked.
[04:36:10] <robertmaxrees> so if you chain your selectors off of that, you'll be golden.
[04:36:26] <Anamol_> its complicated
[04:36:32] <robertmaxrees> how?
[04:36:33] <Rockwood> nice shoes lol
[04:37:22] <Anamol_> i mean
[04:37:30] <Rockwood> Anamol_, why not use jquery css trick?
[04:37:33] <Anamol_> i dont think just writing this will solve the case
[04:37:39] <Anamol_> wont*
[04:37:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[04:38:13] <robertmaxrees> you need to contextually select off of $(this)
[04:38:16] <robertmaxrees> so where's the confusion?
[04:39:51] <Anamol_> i have no idea :(
[04:40:00] <robertmaxrees> so then try.
[04:40:09] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the button that was clicked.
[04:40:17] <robertmaxrees> oh btw you don'ty need that domcontentloaded stuff in there.
[04:40:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/xawo6bkL/8/
[04:40:24] <robertmaxrees> freebie for you.
[04:40:45] <robertmaxrees> your doncontentloaded was calling a function that called a function that called jquery's document ready.
[04:40:47] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[04:41:31] <Anamol_> ohh
[04:41:33] <Anamol_> thank you
[04:41:37] <Anamol_> can u refer me something
[04:41:43] <Anamol_> where i can learn master selector
[04:42:06] <Anamol_> i had the concept of using this but i didnt know what to use exactly
[04:42:10] <Anamol_> like u use this.closest
[04:42:35] <Rockwood> $(this).closest
[04:42:56] <Rockwood> you should try like this
[04:43:20] <Anamol_> yeah thanks to robert
[04:43:25] <Anamol_> didnt know about the closest thing

[04:47:45] <Rockwood> only
[04:47:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[04:47:54] <Rockwood> then?
[04:47:57] <robertmaxrees> i do a bit of everything.
[04:48:05] <robertmaxrees> right now I'm focused on microservies.
[04:48:10] <robertmaxrees> *microservices
[04:48:14] <Rockwood> php java js go
[04:48:27] <robertmaxrees> but I generally specialize in frontend, in-browser.
[04:48:59] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[04:49:09] <Rockwood> just generally
[04:49:29] <Rockwood> actually me to trying learning things
[04:49:43] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, but you are expert i noticed
[04:49:50] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[04:49:55] <robertmaxrees> I know some things ;0
[04:49:59] <Anamol> this is so much easier btw
[04:49:59] <Rockwood> really its not joke
[04:50:01] <robertmaxrees> *;)
[04:50:08] <Anamol> i was so bored of asking small things in stack overflow
[04:50:14] <robertmaxrees> I just have a lot of experience.
[04:50:24] <robertmaxrees> Anamol s'what we're here for.
[04:50:24] <Rockwood> in?
[04:50:36] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood I've done a bit of everything.
[04:50:49] <robertmaxrees>  but I generally specialize in frontend, in-browser.
[04:50:54] <robertmaxrees> like I said earlier.
[04:50:55] <Anamol> woahh
[04:51:06] <Anamol> whats your skills
[04:51:17] <Anamol> im learning front end as well
[04:51:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:51:18] <Anamol> :D
[04:51:39] <robertmaxrees> you'll get to a place where it's not really about "what do you know"
[04:51:50] <robertmaxrees> i just solve problems.  that's all.
[04:52:50] <Anamol> but when u go in search for a job what do you know is important :V
[04:53:09] <robertmaxrees> I'm at a point where people come to me with jobs.
[04:53:15] <robertmaxrees> but years of experience, really.
[04:53:26] <robertmaxrees> i have pure experience.
[04:53:42] <Anamol> you must be old guy then
[04:53:42] <Anamol> xD
[04:53:44] <robertmaxrees> i'm more in the leadership/management side of things these days so it's a different bag.
[04:53:48] <robertmaxrees> nah.  i'm only 31.
[04:54:04] <Anamol> thats old
[04:54:06] <Anamol> im just 20
[04:54:06] <Anamol> xD
[04:54:18] <robertmaxrees> you're just starting.
[04:54:22] <robertmaxrees> you'll get there
[04:54:26] <robertmaxrees> starting earlier than I did.
[05:41:57] <rocketmagnet> hi everyone, when i  use a selector like $("#code"), how can i get the actual element not the Jquery object ?
[05:58:33] <Robdgreat> rocketmagnet: try $("#code")[0]
[06:03:57] <rocketmagnet> ty
[06:18:48] <Robdgreat> sweet
[06:20:07] <Robdgreat> rocketmagnet: oh ok I knew there was another way, seems $("#code").get(0) will do it too, but slower
[06:20:38] <Robdgreat> per https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-pull-a-native-dom-element-from-a-jquery-object/
[07:55:44] <Rockwood> i want limit number of boxes at 50, then the 50 will take the whole width and there's a catch:  if you end up with 65 questions and limit at 50, you want the boxes on the second line to be the same size as the first ---> https://jsfiddle.net/o52L9e7x/1/
[08:12:08] <Rockwood> any active for help right now?
[08:26:15] <Robdgreat> Rockwood: I don't understand your issue. So you're asking how to do what you've just demonstrated in that fiddle?
[08:29:19] <Rockwood> i have a div as you can see in fiddle
[08:29:31] <Rockwood> divfull
[08:32:08] <DB_rando> Hey guys, I'm having a big problem and I'd appreciate some help. Spent the past 7 hours working on this :/
[08:32:17] <DB_rando> I want to set up fullpage.js with Wordpress
[08:33:04] <DB_rando> I've enqueued (and tried to run the scripts inline too at one point) but there is simply nothing showing. Like the script itself is broken. No JS errors, either
[08:33:16] <DB_rando> If I try the 2.9.4 version of the fullpage.js plugin - it works flawlessly
[08:33:27] <DB_rando> 2.9.4 https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fullPage.js/2.9.4/jquery.fullpage.extensions.min.js
[08:33:57] <DB_rando> But I've bought an extension which is made for 3.0.1
[08:34:10] <DB_rando> 3.0.1 https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fullPage.js/3.0.1/fullpage.extensions.min.js
[08:34:49] <DB_rando> For some reason when 2.9.4 will work perfectly (minus the extension I need) but 3.0.1 just does nothing. No errors, nothing; it just dies
[08:35:16] <DB_rando> I've replaced all themes, removed all plugins
[08:35:37] <DB_rando> I don't know enough jQuery to be able to tell why 3.0.1 is working but it has these bits which I think make it different from 2.9.4
[08:36:14] <DB_rando> !function(e,n){"use strict";"function"==typeof define&&define.amd?define(["jquery"],
[08:36:19] <DB_rando> 2.9.4 starts with this
[08:36:32] <DB_rando> Can someone please help me out on this?
[09:49:21] <ryan_ford> I'm not saying you *should*, but you can load 2 different versions of jQ if you need to
[09:56:34] <jak2000> hi all
[09:57:11] <DB_rando> ryan_ford wot
[09:57:17] <ryan_ford> ðŸ‘‹
[09:57:40] <ryan_ford> you could use noConflict and load both versions of jQ if you needed to
[09:57:59] <DB_rando> It's the plugin version (not the jQ version)
[10:01:07] <ryan_ford> are you doing this? https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/
[10:01:11] <ryan_ford> oops wait
[10:01:19] <ryan_ford> https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullpage.js#initialization-with-jquery
[10:03:40] <DB_rando> Yes, exactly
[10:04:19] <DB_rando> I've omitted " $.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false);" because it throws an error but
[10:04:39] <DB_rando> Otherwise that's it
[10:04:50] <DB_rando> It works fine if I don't use the responsiveSlides.js plugin, too
[10:07:17] <ryan_ford> what error do you get with that last part?
[10:10:13] <DB_rando> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fn' of undefined
[10:11:13] <ryan_ford> sounds like jQ isn't loaded
[10:12:46] <DB_rando> Just excluding that one line makes the plugin run fine
[10:12:58] <DB_rando> If you don't account for the extension, that is
[10:13:09] <DB_rando> The second I load the extension everything breaks
[10:14:18] <ryan_ford> well that error is indicative of a different problem that's probably related
[10:14:57] <ryan_ford> are you sure of your load order?
[10:15:18] <DB_rando> Who knows... Yeah, I'm sure. I've googled "responsiveSlides.min.js" and I found a list of sides that pull that extension (not a lot)
[10:15:40] <DB_rando> I've entered the source code of some and tried their previous versions of responsiveSlides (that the author surprisingly doesn't include with the purchase)
[10:15:43] <DB_rando> They seem to be working
[10:16:24] <DB_rando> So using an old version of this seems to be OK, my guess is that the load order is fine
[10:17:17] <ryan_ford> not sure than, maybe post an issue on their gh
[10:27:15] <DB_rando> Hm
[10:27:25] <DB_rando> ryan_ford, I'm using wordpress
[10:27:34] <DB_rando> I know the "$" is screwed there
[10:28:32] <DB_rando> This won't work: https://jsfiddle.net/jrmc7s6k/
[10:28:43] <DB_rando> And is giving me: Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function
[10:28:59] <DB_rando> Do you have an idea why? everything else seems fine now
[10:38:00] <ryan_ford> probably however it's loading
[10:38:08] <ryan_ford> requirejs or something maybe?
[10:38:15] <ryan_ford> or webpack?
[10:38:45] <DB_rando> Hm, looking into it
[10:41:19] <ryan_ford> do you know how to do dependency injection with IIFEs?
[10:41:25] <ryan_ford> https://digwp.com/2011/09/using-instead-of-jquery-in-wordpress/
[10:47:22] <ryan_ford> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/#use-an-immediately-invoked-function-expression
[10:52:08] <DB_rando> Ahh
[10:52:14] <DB_rando> Thanks ryan_ford
[10:52:16] <DB_rando> I figured it out
[10:53:03] <ryan_ford> good deal
[10:59:44] <[E]sc> how can i prevent the dialog box from disappearing after hitting x/closing? i want to be able to launch it again but that div vanishes. i tried setting up a close: function but it doesn't preventDefault()
[11:01:22] <ryan_ford> need context and or code
[11:03:27] <[E]sc> here is the pastebin for my code : https://pastebin.com/eA8CjhUc
[11:09:19] <ryan_ford> is this related to a plugin or something?
[11:10:18] <ryan_ford> preventDefault is more for submit buttons that would reload the page on click. I don't think it would have much effect on some libraries methods
[11:13:29] <[E]sc> ryan_ford, thanks. yes i'm using the jqueryui plugin.
[11:13:49] <[E]sc> so is there a way to close the dialog without destroying it?
[11:16:19] <ryan_ford> what kind of dialog is it? the new html dialog element, or some kind of modal/lightbox?
[11:16:46] <ryan_ford> i mean really without any info about the plugin, who could say? have you tried the docs for the plugin?
[11:22:18] <[E]sc> ryan_ford, i created a div with text at the bottom of the page and the dialog box is launched from there via javascript/jquery.
[11:23:05] <ryan_ford> the dialog is just a div?
[11:24:34] <[E]sc> ryan_ford, yes.  i'm guessing there's another way to accomplish a dialog box?
[11:24:39] <ryan_ford> you're not dealing with any native behavior, so as long as you don't attach an event that destroys it, or you override that you should be ok. you really haven't given enough info to give you a real answer
[11:33:19] <ryan_ford> https://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-beforeClose
[11:33:31] <ryan_ford> that's probably where you'd want to look
[11:44:04] <joao> hi. I'm with a problem, i have variables in python that in each 30 seconds change values, and i need to get this values dinamically in JS any idea?
[11:44:53] <ryan_ford> websockets?
[11:46:30] <joao> i thins i need json
[11:48:11] <ryan_ford> you can use json with websockets
[12:11:51] <joao> and how can i force the jquery to update in x seconds?
[12:13:42] <ryan_ford> well if you wanted to go that route, you could use some vanilla js with setInterval or requestAnimationFrame
[12:42:59] <jak2000> hi all
[14:07:32] <JohnDoe2> jak2000 hey, how are the kids?
[15:31:20] <jak2000> JohnDoe[m] are you there?
