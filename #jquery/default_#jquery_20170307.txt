[00:26:27] <WhirledPress> Alturic, sorry I was eating dinner. You still here?
[03:10:27] <WhirledPress> how can I tell if the top of an element is visible inside a scrolling div?
[03:11:25] <Cork> WhirledPress: position().top > element.height()
[03:22:47] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/aukcvuc3/
[03:23:13] <WhirledPress> I'm trying to capture the "current" article headline to stick to the top and the "next" article headline to stic k to the bottom...
[03:23:56] <Cork> stick to the bottom?
[03:24:06] <Cork> you mean only show the header but nothing else?
[03:24:18] <WhirledPress> so if you click on the bottom title, it would scroll that next article up
[03:24:34] <Cork> should the normal page be scrollable at all?
[03:24:34] <WhirledPress> or if you click on the top title, it would return you to the top of the article.
[03:24:40] <WhirledPress> no
[03:26:10] <Cork> WhirledPress: i would recommend adding an element to "hold" the full article
[03:26:28] <Cork> or isn't the title part of what should be sticky?
[03:27:16] <WhirledPress> I figured inside each "article" element, there's a h2 element. Once it scrolls off the top of the window, I'd set the top bar to the that articles title
[03:27:42] <Cork> what are the temporary suppose to be in this context?
[03:27:52] <Cork> how are they suppose to be positioned in the viewport
[03:28:11] <WhirledPress> links like (return to top of "some article")   or "next article: something"
[03:28:15] <Cork> or should that just be ignored?
[03:28:25] <Cork> is the content_scroller all you care about?
[03:29:29] <WhirledPress> imagine if you scrolled the div up and the title reached the top then stayed there while it's content scrolled up under it. The next title would replace it as you scrolled up.
[03:32:16] <Cork> WhirledPress: you mean something like https://jsfiddle.net/aukcvuc3/1/ ?
[03:32:57] <WhirledPress> how did you do that?   Yes...
[03:33:03] <Cork> position: sticky;
[03:33:13] <Cork> won't work in older ie
[03:33:24] <WhirledPress> never heard of it....wow. How about for the bottom?
[03:33:50] <Cork> not that easy
[03:33:52] <WhirledPress> I love that. Thank you so much.
[03:34:22] <Cork> you could look for the element that is in the scroll area and set a class on it
[03:34:54] <Cork> and then take the article.in-view + article h2 { position: absolute; bottom: 0; } or something like that
[03:35:33] <WhirledPress> I was cycling through all the articles and getting the one whose top coordinate was inside the viewing area, but bottom coordinate was outside. Then the next article was the one I'd put the link to at the bottom
[03:54:30] <sam__> Hi
[06:11:05] <blinky_> Hi all, Is there a cleaner way of completing this - https://jsfiddle.net/u26fd821/ ?
[06:13:01] <Cork> blinky_: sure use the css for css and toggle classes with js
[06:21:28] <jerit> something like this perhaps? https://jsfiddle.net/u26fd821/1/
[06:26:30] <jerit> (minus the typo)
[06:26:55] <blinky_> That is better then I was writting :), cheers
[06:28:18] <Cork> was thinking more in the line of https://jsfiddle.net/u26fd821/2/
[06:28:21] <Cork> but ya both works
[06:29:04] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/u26fd821/3/ is yet another option
[06:30:06] <Cork> heh and actually... https://jsfiddle.net/u26fd821/4/
[06:30:20] * Cork goes to lunch
[06:50:33] <Anticom> Hi all. Is flot charts considered on topic here? I couldn't find a dedicated channel
[07:19:23] <Cork> Anticom: not really, it isn't really jquery related
[07:20:11] <Anticom> Cork: Well it's a jq plugin ;) Also there's no dedicated #flot channel etc. However my questions are irrelevant since i've encountered an issue that ruins my day anyways
[07:20:32] <Cork> ya, i think they're holding out in google forums
[07:21:03] <Cork> Anticom: and plugins are on topic if they are normal dom related, but flot chould just as well be stand alone
[07:21:09] <Cork> as it draws all in a canvas
[07:21:16] <Cork> Anticom: try https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flot-graphs
[07:25:24] <Anticom> Cork: Flot won't work for what i'm trying to do anyways
[08:32:03] <wolfehr> is there a method in jquery to determine the instance number of a selector when multiple exist (basically the reverse of $(‘.foo’).eq(n))?
[08:35:44] <Cork> wolfehr: .index()
[08:36:03] <Cork> so specifically collection.index(elm)
[08:36:24] <wolfehr> perfect, thanks Cork
[08:54:13] <Phlow> Is there any easy way to re-initialize a datatable sourced via HTML that is rendered by a template engine (Vue)
[09:00:37] <shoky_> Phlow: google/SO have plenty of results. http://stackoverflow.com/a/29183567/1098884
[09:02:09] <Phlow> wonder why I didn't see that one...
[09:02:12] <Phlow> will have to try it
[09:20:29] <WhirledPress> can you pass a cached jquery object to .closest()?  like var pnl=$("#thepanel"); if (elem.closest(pnl).length) { do stuff  ?
[09:57:25] <dglambert> morning
[10:08:16] <PereP> hi all
[10:09:27] <PereP> I'm messing around with requests and headers to try to do basic http authentication through ajax and I'm failing miserably because jQuery don't seem to be what I'm telling it to send
[10:09:32] <realies> why cant u do $(document).on("change", $(selector), ...?
[10:10:37] <PereP> my aim is to fill an iframe with my custom content loaded via ajax
[10:11:23] <PereP> I've tried several combinations, mostly sending a custom Authorization header in the beforeSend
[10:11:47] <PereP> that always fails because it's sent as an OPTIONS request instead of a GET
[10:12:34] <PereP> but worst of all is that my Authorization param *never* seems to go through the server -- that is, it's never set nor sent
[10:12:37] <realies> how can you get the text value of a selector?
[10:13:34] <PereP> if I edit (in Firefox) the request, change it to GET, add an Authorizatoin param with a value of "Basic (whatevermyencodeduser:passwordis)" and resend it, I get the proper answer from the server
[10:13:52] <PereP> that is, the right HTML one gets after being authenticated
[10:15:44] <PereP> in Chrome developer tools I sometimes see the message "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present', etc
[10:17:31] <PereP> ...and I tried explicitly enabling it on my server but I'm convinced that's not the cause - it seems it has the proper Allow Origin by default because either setting it explicitly in my Tomcat conf or not it always works when editing and resending the request with the proper headers
[10:21:27] <PereP> any hints?
[10:23:12] <PereP> forgot to mention that I never, ever, have been jQuery sends two requests as one would think from the message above (the preflight and the "proper" one), but just one
[10:32:05] <PereP> no suggestions?
[10:32:49] <PereP> come on; I'm sure someone know how in the hell make jQuery send the header you tell him to send
[10:34:46] <taplar> did you check the api?
[10:40:31] <PereP> my custom headers are being sent as values of Access-Control-Request-Headers
[10:56:34] <steveccc> I am using the scroll position to control the opacity of an element based on scroll position. This is fine as its a number between 0 and one that i can adjust. Is there any way to adjust font colour based on a numerical figure?
[10:58:20] <jak2000> hi all
[10:58:39] <jak2000> offtopic question, anyone know a utility for convert xml to XLS (excel file)?
[11:35:21] <alphabeta> Can you use setInterval functions as 'else if' conditionals?
[11:58:24] <taplar> so sleepy
[14:20:32] <BTM> Would there be any reason why my iframe loading animation behaves differently on whether I load a video embed first, or an iframe? When I load the iframe first, my loader starts disappearing too early. If I load a video first, the loading animation works fine?
[14:28:25] <taplar> load animation for the page containing the iframe or video?
[14:29:23] <taplar> may be the case that load does not consider the load of an iframe, where as a video it definitely would
[14:29:55] <BTM> Well i'm loading each on click. So it auto loads the first tab (either video embed or iframe)
[14:30:17] <BTM> then on click, it removes the src of the iframe, and adds a src to the next tab.
[14:31:24] <BTM> If you take a look at this link, this is loading the video in slot 1, and clicking the tabs will show the loading animation in question : http://bit.ly/2my4T6n
[14:34:47] <taplar> it seems to work except for the Video 2 link
[14:35:00] <BTM> Yeah there is no link there,
[14:35:09] <BTM> now I'll switch the iframe first and you'll see the broken one
[14:35:58] <BTM> Now if you refresh and click around you'll see the animation either not appearing or disappearing early
[14:47:02] <taplar> i'm not sure, but it does look like you are repeatedly binding to iframes and such
[14:49:05] <BTM> Do you mean by adding srcs
[14:49:07] <BTM> ?
[14:49:14] <BTM> I can share the JS as well, 1 sec
[14:49:27] <taplar> no, binding the ready and the load
[14:49:32] <taplar> at the bottom of the tab click logi
[14:50:16] <BTM> https://jsfiddle.net/0kxdwf9v/ yeah, if you take a look at line 92, that is where I'm checking for the ready/load
[14:50:57] <taplar> binding, you are creating a new binding every time
[14:51:18] <BTM> in line 92?
[14:51:36] <taplar> you click a tab for an iframe 10 times, you are going to have 10 bindings of each
[14:52:17] <BTM> Even though I remove them on click?
[14:52:54] <taplar> where?
[14:53:22] <BTM> I remove the loading animation on click at the beginning of the click function
[14:53:29] <BTM> or is that not what you're referring to?
[14:53:48] <taplar> variable 'i' is an iframe, no?
[14:54:16] <taplar> (btw, this is why its important to actually name your variables what they are)
[14:54:55] <BTM> Yes, it's the attr/href of the tab ie: #Tab1 + iframe
[14:55:27] <taplar> ??? line 58 says otherwise
[14:55:59] <BTM> yeah it's h+ iframe
[14:56:11] <taplar> which returns an existing iframe element
[14:56:20] <taplar> -not- an attr/href
[14:56:31] <BTM> h is the attr/href of a tab, so if a tab is <li><a href="#tab1"></a></li>
[14:56:49] <taplar> i'm talking about what 'i' is, not how you get it
[14:56:59] <taplar> i is an existing iframe, yes?
[14:57:04] <BTM> oh then yes, i is used for the iframe
[14:57:23] <taplar> and you are never removing iframes and creating new ones, right?
[14:57:46] <BTM> no, just appending/removing the src
[14:58:15] <taplar> so then line 92-97 is creating two new bindings on the iframe every time a tab is clicked
[14:58:35] <taplar> the iframe, which is reused
[14:58:37] <BTM> so i should be appending/removing the iframe each time?
[14:58:44] <taplar> thus, your are duplicate binding the same logic any time the same tab is clicked >1 time
[14:58:58] <taplar> you should not bind that logic inside that click handler
[14:59:08] <taplar> bind it outside of any event handler
[14:59:31] <taplar> not saying that is the issue, but it is an issue
[15:00:55] <taplar> as far as the issue you are seeing, i'd kinda point you towards debugging these intervals you have
[15:02:23] <BTM> Okay I have to run to a meeting, I'll take of look at that after, thanks for taking a look
[15:24:58] <mannkind_> hi, how can i display data-img value? its returning "undefined" - https://jsfiddle.net/54hyat43/
[15:27:12] <taplar> what element has the data-img on?
[15:27:40] <mannkind_> <div id="random" data-img="1234"><div>
[15:27:53] <mannkind_> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/54hyat43/
[15:27:54] <taplar> what element are you looking for it on?
[15:28:07] <mannkind_> $(this).closest('.white-panel').attr('data-id')
[15:28:13] <taplar> so which element?
[15:28:36] <mannkind_> data-id, inside white-panel
[15:28:42] <taplar> that's not how that works
[15:28:51] <taplar> you are looking for an attribute on the white-panel
[15:28:53] <mannkind_> how its work?
[15:28:55] <taplar> with that code
[15:29:23] <mannkind_> data-img, inside white-panel
[15:29:32] <taplar> attr() looks on a dom node
[15:29:36] <taplar> not on nested nodes
[15:29:38] <mannkind_> cant i use closest white-panel?
[15:29:50] <mannkind_> val()?
[15:29:50] <taplar> you have to lookup the node you want to get the attribute off of
[15:32:34] <tsukasadt> This is mostly a learning question than a practical application question, but is it possible to return a value from a .each() to be used as the value of a variable? An example would be trying to identify the indentation level by testing each class of an element: https://jsfiddle.net/c27kn00b/
[15:32:34] <mannkind_> i have no idea how its work
[15:32:52] <taplar> tsukasadt: no, each does not return a result
[15:33:00] <taplar> it returns the object that it iterates over
[15:33:02] <mannkind_> taplar: what code can i use after on click? =\
[15:33:08] <taplar> if you want to return something, use map() instead
[15:33:19] <tsukasadt> taplar, ty, I didn't think it would work, but I wanted to ask real quick. ^^'
[15:33:32] <taplar> mannkind_: you have to target the element that has the data element on it.  you said it is the random element.  so select that element
[15:34:14] <mannkind_> taplar:  like it? $(this).closest('#random').attr('data-id')
[15:34:35] <taplar> no, just do $('#random').  id's cannot repeat on the page
[15:34:55] <mannkind_> omg, i have no idea
[15:34:57] <mannkind_> thank you
[15:35:05] <taplar> also i'd advise giving learn.jquery.com a read
[15:35:43] <mannkind_> learn.jquery.com - generic response
[15:36:00] <taplar> you are asking some very basic questions.  that tutorial is a good starter
[15:36:22] <mannkind_> taplar: i need display data-img value, only.
[16:05:35] <BTM> Hey taplar: is this better scoped?  https://jsfiddle.net/0kxdwf9v/1/
[16:07:17] <taplar> better, however iframe will not exist outside the click handler
[16:07:31] <taplar> you should select all the iframes that those bindings should exist on
[16:07:53] <BTM> even though it's declared outside of the click handler?
[16:08:35] <taplar> btw, you know that line 24 is a nested document ready, right?
[16:08:58] <BTM> Now I do :P
[16:08:59] <taplar> ln 53, iframe is a var so it is scoped to that handler
[16:08:59] <taplar> further more, it is only one of the iframes on the page
[16:09:13] <taplar> you want to bind one time, to all the iframes
[16:10:02] <taplar> i would recommend putting a class on the iframes those bindings should be put on, so you can select by the class
[16:10:31] <taplar> instead of having to figure out some work around with the their ids
[16:11:08] <BTM> So instead of using $(iframe).ready(function () { i'd use: $('.classname').ready(function () { ?
[16:11:39] <taplar> yep
[16:14:40] <BTM> So something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/0kxdwf9v/3/
[16:15:24] <taplar> line 26 is still a nested document ready
[16:15:37] <taplar> but your bindings look better, :)
[16:16:55] <taplar> instead of line 4 though i'd actually make that change to your markup
[16:17:14] <BTM> I will but I am just trying to get an idea of how I can fix this :)
[16:17:29] <BTM> Also, what could I do instead of $function() { } ?
[16:18:18] <taplar> remove it?
[16:18:18] <taplar> why do you have it?
[16:18:30] <BTM> I was seperating my functions
[16:19:31] <taplar> you could use a basic IIFE then
[16:19:41] <taplar> (function(){ ... your stuff ... })();
[16:21:11] <BTM> like this? https://jsfiddle.net/0kxdwf9v/5/
[16:21:53] <taplar> yep
[16:22:45] <BTM> So now none of my iframe stuff works :o
[16:23:11] <taplar> console errors?
[16:23:24] <BTM> none
[16:23:40] <taplar> oh, you're still referencing 'loads' in the handlers you just moved out
[16:23:56] <BTM> Ah
[16:24:29] <BTM> Wait, I though loads was able to be referenced?
[16:24:56] <taplar> nope, it's a var inside the tab click handler
[16:25:10] <taplar> wait, not it's not
[16:25:32] <BTM> Yeah, but I reference it inside the click, which I probably shouldnt?
[16:25:44] <BTM> or I should move the var inside there, then find a way to reference it outside?
[16:25:45] <taplar> wait, that doesn't make sense.  did you move those variables outside of the tab click handler?
[16:26:20] <BTM> I was under the impression if they were in doc ready but not scoped down, I could reference them?
[16:27:04] <taplar> yes, but you are missing the point of whither or not they -should- be scoped down
[16:27:13] <taplar> you can do lots of things, :)
[16:27:46] <taplar> as you had them inside the click handler, they were scoped down and defined for each tab clicked
[16:27:48] <BTM> Anytime I feel like I'm getting the hang of jquery, i come in here and get proven that I'm not  .__.   lol
[16:28:00] <BTM> https://jsfiddle.net/0kxdwf9v/6/
[16:28:14] <taplar> moving it outside the tab handler, you got multiple problems, in that they are the same for each click
[16:28:33] <andai> I'm trying to prevent a form from submitting with $('#order_form').submit(function(e){e.preventDefault();}); but instead, now it submits as soon as I load the page!
[16:29:53] <taplar> BTM: so now I take it you should have console errors
[16:30:23] <taplar> andai: that looks alright.  should be the older wrapper version of binding.  you could try to change it to on('submit', ...) instead but I wouldn't think that should be causing the submit
[16:31:30] <BTM> Well no, I swapped my 'loads' var on the outside to just '.uiLoading'
[16:31:31] <BTM> https://jsfiddle.net/0kxdwf9v/7/
[16:32:11] <taplar> cool, :)
[16:32:33] <BTM> but my iframes aren't adding a source, so I have to figure out why that is. I think it's because it's out of the click handler?
[16:32:54] <taplar> and btw, i wouldn't say you don't have a hang of jquery.  you just seem to have some confusion of scope, :)
[16:33:13] <andai> taplar: huh that's odd. it works if i do what I wrote. The original code had order_form instead of $('#order_form') because a few lines above i had order_form = $('#order_form');
[16:33:29] <andai> taplar: *shrug* oh well! thanks
[16:33:54] <BTM> taplar: I just realized, i was still calling 'url' instead of 'second_url'
[16:34:00] <taplar> np
[16:34:14] <taplar> i would though still suggest changing to on() instead of submit().  submit() is just a wrapper for on() these days
[16:35:11] <BTM> Oops, that didn't change anything, still no source *shrug*
[16:35:19] <BTM> https://jsfiddle.net/0kxdwf9v/8/
[16:35:24] <andai> taplar: alright
[16:36:02] <andai> taplar: and I figured out my other bug: I want to interrupt the form submit to send some ajax, and then submit the form.. but when I finally submit the form in the end.. it triggers the preventDefault and does an infinite loop!
[16:36:07] <taplar> BTM: console log the second_url?
[16:36:40] <taplar> andai: you can by pass that by doing $form.get().submit()
[16:36:58] <taplar> the low level submit method off of the dom Element does not trigger the event
[16:37:12] <taplar> brb
[16:39:01] <andai> taplar_brb: oh! good to know. I decided to use off() instead :)
[16:40:21] <BTM> taplar: it returns a url, but I wonder if because I'm setting src to "" in the beginning it is removing it after I append as well
[16:41:42] <BTM> Oh wait! I just logged my 'second_url' and 'iframe' and iframe is returning '#tab3.content_frame' so I needed a space in my 'var iframe = $(a_href  + " .content_iframe");'  https://jsfiddle.net/0kxdwf9v/10/
[16:49:29] <BTM> not sure if you saw taplar, but I figured out the iframe src issue
[16:51:47] <taplar> yeah, i saw.
[16:52:20] <BTM> Cool cool and it seems like my earlier issue was due to scoping because now my loader works :D
[16:52:42] <taplar> :D
[16:54:03] <BTM> If I want to check for 2 divs to be on the page before removing the initial loader, can I do that like $('.div1, .div2'); or would I need to use the &&?
[16:54:52] <taplar> you can select them like that, but you will want to check a length or something and make sure it's 2
[16:55:01] <taplar> *results
[16:56:02] <taplar> and actually in the case i might lean more towards selecting by ids instead of two classes
[16:56:08] <BTM> Well its 2 seperate divs that load in, so I just have to check if they're there. So i was using .length > 2
[16:56:20] <taplar> since you could, theoretically have two divs with a class of 'div1'
[16:56:51] <taplar> 2 > 2 ?
[16:57:46] <BTM> Well i'm more or less checking for  '#tab1 video' (only 1)  and  '.tablist .tab-active' (only 1)
[16:58:08] <BTM> Basically I'm trying to keep the full screen loader up until both the nav and video have loaded in :)
[16:59:26] <taplar> i was more pointing at the conditional logic
[17:00:19] <BTM> Oh god
[17:00:34] <BTM> I meant length > 0   I was readying .div2 while typing lol
[17:32:38] <adtersher> im trying to create an external link warning that also works with form submits. any ideas? https://codepen.io/lnorton/pen/EWNQwW
[17:38:42] <taplar> you could take the form action and stick it in a dynamic a element to get the hostname
[17:39:20] <adtersher> not really sure what you mean. the form action has to be a set link, not dynamic.
[17:39:55] <adtersher> i've added an id to the submit button in question; not sure if that makes it any easier
[17:40:14] <taplar> var a = document.createElement('a'); a.href = form.action; console.log(a.hostname);
[17:42:42] <adtersher> too much work. think i'll just create the form buttons as anchors and style them like buttons since no form data is actually being submitted. thanks though.
