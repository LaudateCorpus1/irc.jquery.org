[01:55:27] <Cork> maxpert: that isn't a jquery error, the problem comes from _alert2 that you're calling
[01:55:44] <maxpert> yep figured it out
[01:55:57] <maxpert> Crok: thanks
[01:55:58] <maxpert> :)
[01:56:11] <Cork> k
[04:23:55] <aditsu_> hi, I noticed that jquery slide methods don't really slide the content (at least when text is involved), but rather reveal it gradually, is there a way to do an actual slide effect?
[04:24:42] <Cork> aditsu_: slide slide the height/width of the element
[04:25:08] <Koopz> yoh! i heard jquery-ui ships with a "remove" event
[04:25:10] <Cork> aditsu_: and yes you can do full element slide, depending on where you want it it might require additional elements though (also i would recommend using css3)
[04:25:37] <Koopz> apparently that thing doesn't work if you delegate
[04:25:59] <Cork> Koopz: ok?
[04:26:15] <Koopz> $('.element').on('remove', function() {}); works while $(document).on('remove', '.element', function() {}); doesn't
[04:26:16] <Cork> jquery ui has lots of fake events
[04:26:22] <Koopz> is that normal?
[04:26:43] <Cork> sometimes, depends on how the fake event is triggered
[04:26:55] <Cork> bubbling is costly
[04:27:14] <Koopz> $('.element').remove();
[04:27:31] <aditsu_> Cork: so.. animate the top property?
[04:27:38] <Cork> aditsu_: exactly
[04:28:01] <Cork> position: relative or absolute and animate the top/left property
[04:28:26] <Cork> if there isn't something you can hide the element behind wrap it in an element with overflow: hidden;
[04:28:40] <aditsu_> so I can do that with jquery animate function; I also played a bit with css transitions but they seem a bit harder to control
[04:29:22] <Cork> aditsu_: the big advantage with css transition is that the browser knows what is going to happen, so it can pre generate the frames
[04:29:30] <Cork> so you get much smoother animations
[04:29:42] <Cork> (especially on low power hardware like tablets or phones)
[04:30:03] <Cork> but it makes a big difference on destkop too
[04:30:52] <aditsu_> I see.. and there's the same issue with having a wrapper, right?
[04:31:03] <Cork> yes
[04:31:13] <Cork> you will animate the same thing, just much smoother
[04:31:30] <Cork> one limitation is that css3 can't animate height: auto or width: auto
[04:32:07] <aditsu_> it can't transition "position" either :p
[04:32:27] <Cork> you can't do that with js either
[04:32:36] <Cork> but you don't need to
[04:33:06] <aditsu_> I need to change it between absolute and relative, but I can just do it explicitly
[04:33:16] <_August_> can someone take a quick look at my code I cant quite figure out how to close a table row after every loop. It opens and all the tds load inside of it. http://pastebin.com/qebySNPg
[04:33:20] <Cork> why would you need to do that?
[04:33:52] <aditsu_> I want an element to slide on top of another one, and afterwards it should replace it, occupying the space
[04:34:15] <Cork> aditsu_: so just give it a position: relative parent
[04:34:49] <Cork> then set position top at bottom and animate the parent
[04:35:47] <aditsu_> I don't understand..
[04:37:21] <Cork> aditsu_: you could make a jsfiddle of the problem and i could show you
[04:37:50] <aditsu_> ok let me write a basic example
[04:48:23] <aditsu_> Cork: ok I got something here: https://jsfiddle.net/5og2kr1j/
[04:50:00] <aditsu_> (jquery way)
[04:52:07] <Cork> aditsu_: one min i need to handle something else
[05:12:46] <Cork> there back
[05:25:41] <ozette> i'm trying to submit a form, the browser's default submit works fine with my backend, but when i try to use jquery's serialize() my backend says "Can not read property 'Foo' of undefined"
[05:26:39] <ozette> jquery serialize makes a 'query' string literal, and i assume browsers send an object by default?
[05:26:45] <Cork> aditsu_: sorry for the wait https://jsfiddle.net/5og2kr1j/1/
[05:27:24] <Cork> ozette: you want to send json?
[05:28:17] <ozette> Cork: well yes, my backend expects some kind of object to get object.Foo object.Bar etc.
[05:28:41] <Cork> ozette: $.ajax by default sends javascript objects and arrays as params
[05:28:45] <ozette> but serialze() sends a query string which somehow results in this error in my backend, but my backend proceeds to somehow still extract the values
[05:28:52] <ozette> but this error bugs me personally
[05:28:55] <Cork> ozette: ya, cause serialize uses params
[05:29:07] <ozette> hmm
[05:29:13] <Cork> and you don't have nested objects in params, unless the server side regenerates that structure
[05:29:14] <ozette> i need something like deparam
[05:29:33] <ozette> i see
[05:29:34] <Cork> ozette: what content-type does the default form submit use?
[05:29:54] <ozette> the enc-type?
[05:29:55] <Cork> (also the server might trigger on if the post comes from ajax, and expect different content type in that case)
[05:30:02] <Cork> enc...??
[05:30:08] <Cork> never heard of it
[05:30:10] <ozette> enctype
[05:30:18] <ozette> anyway it's multipart/form-dta
[05:30:25] <ozette>  /data
[05:30:40] <Cork> ah, you can't use serialize for that
[05:30:49] <Cork> you need to use formData
[05:31:07] <Cork> ozette: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData
[05:31:11] <ozette> i thought browsers didn't support formData
[05:31:33] <Cork> fairly modern browsers do
[05:31:43] <ozette> serialize seems to work fine, but it ends up in "Foo=abc&Bar=def"
[05:31:56] <Cork> it doesn't support file pickers
[05:32:04] <Cork> you can't ever send files with serialize
[05:32:07] <ozette> i see
[05:32:12] <ozette> and that's what i need :/
[05:32:24] <ozette> let's see if FormData can do anything for me..
[05:35:54] <ozette> is FormData able to prepopulate with values from hidden fields?
[05:36:21] <ozette> this isn't jquery specific, but my formData obj is empty..
[05:37:42] <Cork> ozette: it does that by default
[05:37:56] <Cork> just give it the form element and it will handle the form like a normal submit would
[05:38:13] <Cork> var data = new FormData(formElement);
[05:39:21] <ozette> well not in my browser, then again this is chrome v 43
[05:39:33] <Cork> ozette: it should work there too
[05:39:33] <ozette> FormData is known, but only has an append function
[05:39:48] <Cork> ya, that is expected
[05:39:53] <ozette> ok, but
[05:40:35] <ozette> when i say 'form = document.querySelector("#myform");'
[05:40:54] <ozette> formData = new FormData(form);
[05:40:57] <ozette> formData is empty.
[05:41:07] <Cork> ozette: make a jsfiddle
[05:41:08] <ozette> and #myform contains lots of hidden values
[05:41:13] <ozette> ok
[05:41:19] <Cork> you can't get the data out of the formData
[05:41:40] <ozette> how do you mean?
[05:41:43] <Cork> that complicates things a bit, but it should work (in basically all chrome and firefox you can get your hand on)
[05:42:05] <Cork> ozette: formdata can basically only be used to submit the data with ajax
[05:42:16] <Cork> you can't access what it has collected in the console or to a variable
[05:42:40] <Cork> this is by design
[05:45:53] <ozette> isn't that weird?
[05:46:12] <Cork> it is a must cause of what it is suppose to handle
[05:46:42] <Cork> and that is among other reasons why it only has .append()
[05:47:23] <Cork> basically formdata is a way for javascript to construct a special object the browser can use to send data you normally can't send through ajax
[05:47:30] <ozette> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/wcz8kvqd/
[05:47:51] <ozette> so this is how it should be?
[05:47:58] <ozette> because i'm not convinced..
[05:51:01] <Cork> ozette: btw, don't use event attributes
[05:51:12] <Cork> those are messy and makes event handling hard
[05:52:19] <ozette> Cork: you mean the onclick?
[05:52:23] <ozette> i figured..
[05:52:23] <Cork> yes
[05:52:35] <ozette> then what do you suggest?
[05:52:44] <Cork> one min let me get this going
[05:53:56] <Cork> gah... right chrome doesn't log network calls in the console >_<'
[05:54:02] <ozette> oh
[05:54:11] <Cork> lol man that sent me hunting...
[05:54:20] <Cork> ozette: https://jsfiddle.net/wcz8kvqd/2/
[05:54:25] <Cork> open the network tab
[05:54:29] <Cork> click the submit button
[05:54:39] <Cork> and inspect the html/ post
[05:54:49] <Cork> specifically the "Request Payload"
[05:56:01] <aditsu_> Cork: thanks, huh, a lot of calc's
[05:56:23] <ozette> Cork: i see
[05:56:29] <Cork> aditsu_: you can replace them with a fixed px or rem or % or what ever
[05:56:37] <aditsu_> I don't like to use a fixed height
[05:56:40] <ozette> Cork: looks great
[05:57:31] <Cork> aditsu_: me neither, but if that means i have to use js dom modifications for animations, "the less evil..."
[05:57:56] <aditsu_> I see fixed height as the greater evil :p
[05:58:26] <Cork> aditsu_: js animations has big problems with doing the animations
[05:58:34] <Cork> and it is actually getting worse
[05:58:51] <Cork> also it breaks liquid design
[05:59:58] <aditsu_> o_O
[06:00:29] <Cork> meaning js breaks media queries
[06:01:20] <aditsu_> I'm not using media queries; anyway... I think I can change my code to use css transitions
[06:02:02] <aditsu_> no fixed height, but still switching between absolute and relative position
[06:07:25] <ozette> Cork: this is so perfect, thanks :-)
[06:07:35] <ozette> my app likes this setup
[06:07:41] <Cork> :)
[06:08:05] <Cork> it usually helps if you send the format the server expects
[06:09:35] <ozette> makes sense
[06:20:58] <ozette> the event in the callback function of 'submit' i'd like to know what i can do with it, but i can't seem to log it
[06:23:10] <ozette> nevermind, found the documentation on this at /Types/#Event
[06:25:36] <ozette> if i'd like to keep track of the ajax progress, i'd have to make use of the xhr attribute in $.ajax, hm?
[06:25:38] <mackskay> Hi guys, just getting to know some jquery and am getting the hang of it, however would this fiddle possible to be shorten a bit: https://jsfiddle.net/ovauqjub/?
[06:40:19] <ozette> what's a good way to attach a progress listener to this set up, i've seen a project on github which allows for .progress() chaining $.ajax, https://github.com/likerRr/jq-ajax-progress, would you recommend it?
[06:43:16] <Cork> ozette: never bothered, i think it depends on the server sending information, but not sure
[06:45:02] <ozette> well, somehow browsers are aware of the progress
[06:45:39] <ozette> i will try out this plug in, but i'm not sure what's the best way to go about this
[06:46:09] <Cork> ozette: the only way you can access it is through the progress event
[06:46:19] <Cork> but like i said, i can't really help you there
[06:51:36] <ozette> yea, i'm looking to add a listener for the progress event on this $.ajax construction
[06:52:19] <ozette> for some reason the code in this .uploadProgress function body of this jq-ajax plugin is not executed
[06:53:09] <aditsu_> damn, those transitions never work when I need them to
[07:18:06] <afidegnum> hello, while i am following a tutorial at https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/How-to-submit-additional-form-data about how to form data,  i m having an error over a custom built function http://dpaste.com/2MMHBPH  unexpected $variable
[07:18:20] <afidegnum> what's the correct way?
[07:20:04] <Cork> afidegnum: {} is an object, you can't declare a local variable there
[07:20:52] <Cork> afidegnum: also i'm not fully up to date with the fileupload plugin, so you would have to provide some more context
[07:35:55] <jerit> Cork, my contractor who wrote a POS system for my client messaged me on Skype on Friday morning asking "why can't I add items for check out?" so I went and looked and I saw a jquery error about an undefined value on the page. After I tell him that he says "but nothing changed there"
[07:41:06] <ozette> why would console.log in a callback function print in jsfiddl, but not on my end when the code that follows is executed?
[07:42:09] <ozette> all logs are enabled
[07:42:13] <ozette> in my console
[07:42:19] <ozette> oh crap wrong channel
[07:46:00] <Cork> jerit: heh, ya
[07:55:57] <jerit> actually ozette I think that's a perfectly fine question for this channel
[07:57:20] <ozette> jerit: thanks
[07:57:46] <ozette> i found out that my event listener was wrapped up in a function that was never executed
[07:58:03] <ozette> -_-
[07:58:18] <ozette> anyway, i managed to get my progress bar working with this jq-ajax-progress plugin
[07:58:31] <ozette> it works very nice :)
[08:32:15] <jose3_> Hello, orning
[08:32:53] <jose3_> how can I write this more clearly/better : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f1a998920aeaa34da2122595a6f8b816
[08:33:24] <jose3_> I had it as a big else if thing, but I i didn't think it looked clean. But it seems a little silly to have two back to back switches
[08:33:43] <Cork> jose3_: firstly use $.param on a javascript object instead of the string concating on line 44
[08:34:04] <Cork> or if you use $.ajax, just store the object
[08:35:04] <Cork> jose3_: the switch cases could be converted to object lookups if you like
[08:35:30] <jose3_> hmm, okay I have too look all this stuff up now
[08:35:31] <jose3_> thanks
[08:45:05] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/2Dci86QJ/
[08:47:23] <jerit> looks about right
[08:47:34] <jerit> params would just be a collection of json objects
[08:48:30] <Cork> jose3_: data: => data =
[08:48:37] <Cork> except for that you're correct
[08:48:58] <jose3_> heh oops
[08:49:57] <Cork> jose3_: also please ask the questions in the channel so ppl don't have to load the url before they know if they can answer
[08:50:36] <jose3_> ok  no prob
[08:53:45] <dddh_> oh
[08:56:44] <jose3_> Cork: using that param object is great, thanks
[08:56:55] <Cork> np
[08:58:57] <jerit> ah well spotted there Cork. I assumed data: was part of a $.ajax so I didn't notice the problem
[08:59:16] <Cork> jose3_: for the switch cases you can do something like var apiNode = callNumTranslation[callNumAndNote];
[08:59:26] <Cork> and have an object with the translation keys
[08:59:59] <Cork> ex. { 'SWC1 Did Not Connect': 'swc1', 'SWC1 Left Message': 'swc1' }
[09:00:28] <Cork> i personally usually use that structure, but it is more a matter of taste
[09:12:28] <jose3_> oh, so make the possible note values the key that creates the variable
[09:13:13] <jose3_> don't use any kind of ifelse or switch just make it key val pair
[09:17:31] <Cork> jose3_: exactly
[09:17:44] <Cork> for simple cases like this it is often simpler to read and maintain
[09:17:58] <Cork> with more complex structures it might not though
[09:24:29] <jose3_> thanks this is a much better idea than what I had
[09:53:59] <aditsu_> hey, why is this transition not working? https://jsfiddle.net/w47gjc4n/ (it works if I remove class="hidden" but isn't x.removeClass("hidden"); supposed to take care of that?)
[09:54:57] <Cork> aditsu_: you can't animate display: none
[09:55:10] <Cork> so you get a jump
[09:55:38] <Cork> the solution is to use visibility: hidden;
[09:55:41] <aditsu_> Cork: I expect a jump for removing "hidden", but when adding "show" it should still transition
[09:55:58] <Cork> aditsu_: no, cause it will go from "not pressent"
[09:56:04] <Cork> so no previous value
[09:56:30] <aditsu_> o__O
[09:56:56] <Cork> it is cause how browser optimize how display: none elements are handled
[09:57:32] <aditsu_> so it will work if I do it with a delay?
[09:57:54] <Cork> no, you can't animate display, ever
[09:57:57] <aditsu_> like setTimeout
[09:58:03] <Cork> it doesn't participate in animations
[09:58:05] <aditsu_> I am not trying to animate display!
[09:58:08] <Cork> use visibility
[09:59:21] <aditsu_> huh, yeah it works with setTimeout, strange
[10:00:23] <Cork> except setTimeout will break in lost of cases
[10:00:39] <Cork> (ex. if the animation runs in the background while the user is on another tab)
[10:00:50] <aditsu_> yeah I don't plan to actually use it, just testing
[10:01:24] <Cork> just never use display: none on elements you want to animate into view with css3 transition or animation
[10:01:40] <aditsu_> well, TIL…
[10:14:49] <aditsu_> Cork: I think I got it: https://jsfiddle.net/49hwcsfo/
[10:17:26] <aditsu_> now to apply this to my original thing..
[10:57:01] <aditsu_> now the question is how to make something disappear by sliding up and let the content below slide up with it
[11:02:38] <Yepp> my popup inside a modal does not show up but works when placed outside. I'm using semantic UI btw
[11:02:49] <Yepp> even if id is used
[11:03:01] <Yepp> it would initialize if I were to initialize it from the browser console
[12:37:44] <tona> hello guys i am using this code in jquery to select one id on this case are tabs , but i am expecting one issue , when i copy the link like this www.localhost/#panel1 select of panel1 or first tab, i copy it again into another tab like www.localhost/#panel2 and it work fine , but when i change the value into the same page like www.localhost/#panel1 or panel2 it doesnt change i need to refresh the page in order my code work , could someon
[12:38:23] <robertmaxrees> tona that cut off.
[12:38:32] <robertmaxrees> tona could you make a fiddle to show us what you're trying to do?
[12:39:26] <tona> i tried to use it , but it doeesnt work there basically i dont know why i need to reload my page to my code work ,
[12:39:35] <robertmaxrees> i can't see your code.
[12:39:42] <robertmaxrees> so i don't know what you're doing wrong.
[12:39:44] <tona> ok let me pasted it
[12:45:55] <tona> https://jsfiddle.net/dhkz9239/#tab1
[12:46:01] <tona> https://jsfiddle.net/dhkz9239/#tab2
[12:46:10] <tona> it should change to select tab1 or tab2
[12:46:29] <tona> but i need to refresh each time in order my work works
[12:47:45] <robertmaxrees> is jquerytabs available somewhere on a cdn?
[12:49:56] <tona> yes it is into jsfiddle
[12:49:58] <robertmaxrees> actually... do you even need that tabs js file?
[12:50:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dhkz9239/3/
[12:50:18] <robertmaxrees> this functioning basically the way you'd expect it do?
[12:50:33] <tona> i remove it it is not necesasry
[12:51:42] <tona> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dhkz9239/3/#tab3
[12:51:47] <tona> should go tab3
[12:52:15] <tona> it only work in ly local but not fiddle , unfortunately on my local i need to refresh in order my code work
[12:52:39] <robertmaxrees> so the reason this doesn't work in jsfiddle is var tab = window.location.hash doesn't get what you think it does.
[12:52:48] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to refresh on your local?
[12:52:58] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused about what's broken.
[12:53:49] <robertmaxrees> you mean when you change the #3 to #1 in the url it needs to change?
[12:53:56] <tona> ok let me rphase, if i copy the url into another tab it work fine like WWW.localhost/#panel1 but when i change the url into the same tab #panel2 never change i need to reload in order to make it work
[12:54:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah - you need to setup a hashchange listener.
[12:54:22] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onhashchange
[12:54:31] <tona> how could i do it ?
[12:54:38] <robertmaxrees> look at the page i just linked.
[12:54:42] <tona> let me see it , do you undertand me :)
[12:55:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:55:08] <robertmaxrees> i just gave you the solution,
[12:55:35] <tona> ok i get it , sorry i couldn explain the first time
[12:55:41] <robertmaxrees> it's fine.
[13:00:20] <tona> robertmaxrees take a look https://jsfiddle.net/dhkz9239/7/#tab2
[13:00:30] <tona> i have put the code , but still doesnt wok :(
[13:01:47] <robertmaxrees> window.onhashchange = function() {
[13:01:50] <robertmaxrees> not funcRef
[13:18:36] <tona> robertmaxrees i have put the code but it disable the functionabilities of tabs :( https://jsfiddle.net/dhkz9239/10/
[13:18:59] <robertmaxrees> because you now have a js error.
[13:19:01] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[13:19:08] <robertmaxrees> $( window ).hashchange(function() { won't work.
[13:19:37] <robertmaxrees> youneed to use the native version.
[13:20:09] <tona> what do you mean with native version into body ?
[13:20:22] <robertmaxrees> window.onhashchange = function() {
[13:20:39] <robertmaxrees> $( window ).hashchange(function() { won't work because it doesn't exist.
[13:21:13] <tona> https://jsfiddle.net/dhkz9239/12/
[13:21:23] <tona> i have changed it i missing )
[13:21:24] <robertmaxrees> you didn't fix it.
[13:21:41] <robertmaxrees> look at your console again.
[13:23:30] <tona> robertmaxrees which console  https://jsfiddle.net/dhkz9239/10/
[13:23:32] <tona> ?
[13:23:46] <robertmaxrees> your browser's developer tools.
[13:24:05] <tona> a ok it never call window :(
[13:24:07] <tona> i check it
[13:24:21] <tona> then which function could i get to get listening on hash
[13:24:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:24:29] <robertmaxrees> you already had it.
[13:24:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dhkz9239/13/
[13:29:04] <tona> i have put this code on my local but it is not switching between tabs like should go
[13:29:05] <tona> window.onhashchange = function() {     var tab = window.location.hash;     var cadena = '#' + tab.split('#').pop()       alert (cadena);     $(cadena).click();   }
[13:29:17] <tona> seem  $(cadena).click(); never click
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> so what value are you getting for cadena?
[13:29:35] <tona> sorry rovertmaxrees :( to bother you
[13:29:48] <tona> #panel1 and #panel2
[13:30:15] <tona> i put one alert (cadena) and it return me the values expectred
[13:30:16] <robertmaxrees> try console.log($(cadena).length)); - instead of that alert. what do you get?
[13:31:48] <tona> 6
[13:31:56] <arc_> heh
[13:32:12] <robertmaxrees> also: what's with the .split('#').pop() ?
[13:32:26] <robertmaxrees> then you've got something really brojen.
[13:32:34] <robertmaxrees> *broken - that means you're not using an ID selector.
[13:32:57] <arc_> cadena is a string is it not
[13:33:19] <robertmaxrees> $(cadena).length should return the number of selected elements.
[13:33:34] <robertmaxrees> if he's using an ID selector, that should only ever be 1 or 0.
[13:33:52] <arc_> but i'm saying this isn't selecting anything, it's a string " var cadena = '#' + tab.split('#').pop() "
[13:34:13] <robertmaxrees> errr
[13:34:22] <robertmaxrees> console.log($(cadena).length)); isn't getting the length of a string though.
[13:34:30] <arc_> oh right, sorry
[13:34:41] <robertmaxrees> tona https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dhkz9239/14/
[13:34:42] <robertmaxrees> try this.
[13:34:59] <tona> ok
[13:40:44] <robertmaxrees> tona any success?
[13:42:08] <tona> i am checking , just for curious if string has one value #panel1 into , i run $(cadena).click() it should go directly on div with that id right ?
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> "go directly on div"?  it'll trigger the click event on whatever element has that ID.
[13:43:35] <tona> a ok :)
[13:43:53] <tona> that it the issue that i started to talk , sometimes work sometimes doesnt work
[13:44:00] <tona> i have put the code like you told me
[13:44:10] <tona> i need to refresh my page in order that work :(
[13:44:28] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with your developer tools?
[13:45:34] <tona> honestly no :(
[13:45:41] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[13:45:45] <robertmaxrees> check this out
[14:31:02] <z1haze_work> inside a submit() handler, what is the context of this?
[14:31:06] <z1haze_work> is it still the form?
[14:31:07] <robertmaxrees> the form.
[14:31:12] <z1haze_work> sweet thank you
[14:31:44] <z1haze_work> and wil it already be wrapped in jquery or do i need to do $(this)
[14:31:58] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other event handler - 'this' is just the ray dom node.
[14:32:00] <robertmaxrees> *raw
[14:32:10] <z1haze_work> alright
[14:53:29] <Forbidd3n> Maybe not something that is commonly done, but is there a way to set !important with .css(...)
[14:53:39] <robertmaxrees> nope.  no need to.
[14:54:10] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: why would you say there is no need to?
[14:54:45] <taplar> css sets an inline style so if it's being overridden then some rule affecting it has !important on it
[14:55:15] <robertmaxrees> because you're bypassing the entire CSSOM and modifying the element directly, which should bypass pretty much anything else that could impact the element.
[14:55:25] <robertmaxrees> also: http://api.jquery.com/css/ -> "Note: .css() ignores !important declarations. So, the statement $( "p" ).css( "color", "red !important" ) does not turn the color of all paragraphs in the page to red. It's strongly advised to use classes instead; otherwise use a jQuery plugin."
[14:55:30] <MassDebates> Forbidd3n:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2655925/how-to-apply-important-using-css
[14:55:49] <MassDebates> It's the issue of it not understanding what role the '!important' serves.
[14:56:00] <robertmaxrees> i would really avoid using .css() in general fwiw.
[14:56:00] <Forbidd3n> The issue I am having is I am using Wordpress and extending customizer. I have primary font h1-h6 tags setting color, but I need to set all other elements to a secondary color which I am using *{ ... } and that of course changes the primary color as well
[14:56:30] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't use jquery to fix that.
[14:56:59] <taplar> more specific css rules take precedence, so you could define one and add classes to make it match
[14:57:06] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I am using it with a custom solution for customizer preview. Not a live site
[14:57:58] <robertmaxrees> ah.  any reason you can't just do addClass/removeClass and handle it that way?
[14:59:13] <Forbidd3n> not sure. Thinking of a solution
[15:10:22] <kanzie> if I have a li-tag like this <li data-foo-name=“bar”> how can I select this based on its data-tag
[15:10:35] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() with a function.
[15:11:07] <robertmaxrees> you can use attribute selectors, but they're funky since data attributes can be set/modified and changed out from under you in strange ways.
[15:12:04] <kanzie> robertmaxrees: so $(“li[data-foo-name=bar]) is not recommended?
[15:12:14] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't suggest it.
[15:12:55] <kanzie> so filter on its parent is better?
[15:13:01] <robertmaxrees> that's not what I said :)
[15:13:07] <robertmaxrees> $('li').filter((index, element) => { return $(element).data('fooName') ==='bar' });
[15:13:14] <robertmaxrees> something along these lines.
[15:35:48] <OnTheRocks> hello
[15:36:00] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[15:36:06] <OnTheRocks> i am getting this error: jquery-1.11.2.min.js:4 XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:***.txt. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource.
[15:36:17] <OnTheRocks> do you know why?
[15:36:30] <robertmaxrees> OnTheRocks are you trying to access a file on the localfilesystem?
[15:36:38] <robertmaxrees> *local filesystem
[15:36:59] <OnTheRocks> yes
[15:37:02] <robertmaxrees> that would be why.
[15:37:08] <OnTheRocks> i am working on local files
[15:37:19] <OnTheRocks> how can i do it over local files?
[15:37:21] <robertmaxrees> the browser and jquery are stopping you from doing something pretty dangerous.
[15:37:33] <robertmaxrees> any reason you don't have a local server setup?
[15:39:24] <OnTheRocks> its because iam just training the language
[15:39:37] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - you should learn how to properly do it.
[15:39:38] <OnTheRocks> its not a really work
[15:40:00] <robertmaxrees> changing your browser to allow it is extremely dangerous and opens you up to some very big security problems.
[15:40:04] <OnTheRocks> but i need to have a server?~
[15:40:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:40:23] <robertmaxrees> lots of simple options out there.
[15:40:29] <OnTheRocks> what type of server?
[15:40:33] <robertmaxrees> a web server.
[15:40:35] <OnTheRocks> like a php server?
[15:40:37] <OnTheRocks> wamp?
[15:40:37] <robertmaxrees> one that can serve pages.
[15:40:43] <robertmaxrees> you could use apache, sure.
[15:40:57] <robertmaxrees> or a simple node or python setup.
[15:41:04] <robertmaxrees> an HTTP server, really.
[15:41:35] <OnTheRocks> i need only services running? or i need to put site online?
[15:41:45] <robertmaxrees> you just need to run the site using an http server.
[15:41:49] <robertmaxrees> it can be local.
[15:42:11] <OnTheRocks> but its just for a lesson tutorial
[15:42:18] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't matter.
[15:42:28] <robertmaxrees> plus it's a good thing to learn.
[15:42:41] <OnTheRocks> how can i adjust chrome to run it?
[15:42:48] <robertmaxrees> don't.
[15:43:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you are opening yoursellf up to a very dangerous kind of attack.
[15:43:03] <robertmaxrees> setup a local server instead.
[15:43:08] <robertmaxrees> it'll take a few minutes and it'll be done
[15:43:23] <OnTheRocks> ok
[15:43:33] <OnTheRocks> i will try then
[15:43:40] <OnTheRocks> thank you
[16:04:32] <JonelethIrenicus> i am trying to implement some kind of locking like function to block users from using a portion of an internal intranet site
[16:04:39] <JonelethIrenicus> it is inside a jquery tab
[16:04:44] <JonelethIrenicus> just the 1st tab
[16:05:04] <JonelethIrenicus> i tried using a css overlay, but it isn't working
[16:05:21] <JonelethIrenicus> no error just no overlay
[16:08:09] <taplar> you shouldn't rely on js for security
[16:08:16] <OnTheRocks> jquery ui and bootstrap have similar purposes?
[16:41:20] <BlackJack> Trying to use http://icheck.fronteed.com/ but I'm a little confused on so mething; when I check off a box how can I access that element?
[16:57:30] <nebby> Hello, I have the following, but it doesn't do what I expect. http://pastebin.com/j32FTsSx What should I do instead?
[16:58:26] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[16:59:52] <shoky> nebby: by the time the callback is called, the loop is already long finished and i is at the last value
[17:00:03] <shoky> don't use for loops
[17:00:25] <shoky> and don't use class/id names with numbers in them like that
[17:00:39] <nebby> what should I do instead? shoky?
[17:00:40] <shoky> just use a shared class and select by class
[17:01:02] <shoky> $('.show-more').click(...);
[17:01:15] <shoky> and use $(this)  inside the handler
[17:01:21] <nebby> but the inside of the click will be different
[17:01:35] <nebby> each button opens a different text
[17:01:43] <taplar> can you show us an example of your markup?
[17:02:22] <decx> just create a relation between team-member and their show-more
[17:02:33] <shoky> anyways to avoid a for loop you can do smth like  Array(5).fill().forEach(function(v, i) { ... })
[17:06:37] <nebby> using let instead of var fixed it
[17:07:20] <taplar> advice ignored, aaaaaachieved
[17:07:48] <shoky> heh
[17:09:06] <nebby> but yes, I will avoid for loops next time ;)
[17:09:09] <nebby> for doing this
[17:09:21] <taplar> not the advice i was referring to
[17:09:21] <nebby> and instead use data attributes
[17:09:26] <nebby> to achieve the effect
[17:19:12] <dmiess_> Hi, I'm trying to use jquery to create a spinner that shows when some work is being done. I'm using the following line to change the initial blank gif to my spinner: $("#spinpic").attr("src", "../images/indicator.gif?" + new Date().getTime());
[17:19:32] <dmiess_> This works fine on internet exploroer and firefox but doesn't seem to work on Chrome
[17:19:39] <robertmaxrees> try .prop instead of attr
[17:19:52] <dmiess_> I can see the img src changing but I never actually see the spinner in my browser
[17:20:26] <dmiess_> robertmaxrees: Thanks, I'll give that a try
[17:21:04] <decx> does it spin you round?
[17:21:13] <decx>  right round?
[17:21:33] <decx> right round round round maybe?
[17:21:37] <dmiess_> decx: Sadly no :(
[17:28:20] <dmiess_> robertmaxrees: I gave your suggestion a try but I'm still seeing the same behaviour. Works on IE + firefox but not on chrome. Oddly enough, in both cases although the spinner never shows afterwards I switch it to a checkmark and that is displayed correctly on all browsers
[17:28:47] <robertmaxrees> sooo - i have to ask: why not just hide/show another element that is the image you want?
[17:29:55] <dmiess_> robertmaxrees: I could give that a shot, I just figured this was the cleaner solution
[17:30:09] <robertmaxrees> nah.  Hiding/showing elements is really the "cleaner" way.
[17:30:13] <robertmaxrees> let your css handle it.
[17:30:38] <dmiess_> robertmaxrees: Alright, I'll give that a try then. Thanks for the help
[17:44:02] <dmiess_> robertmaxrees: Gave it a try using the show/hide method and that worked perfectly, thanks again
[17:47:29] <angelica_> Hello, I'm learning and am fairly new to jquery and Javascript.... I have a layout that is tricky to lay out with basic CSS, and I found that jquery will make it work. Is it wise to do this: Implement the jquery if available. If jquery's not available, then load secondary css (but this add un-preferred padding to the bottom of the page)
[17:47:37] <JonelethIrenicus> when i try and change the text of a button it removes the styling of the button
[17:47:51] <JonelethIrenicus> button.text("change");
[17:48:10] <lemonsparrow> var a = "AMOUNT_TO_RECOVER\tAMOUNT_TO_RECOVER\t0\tacc=1420256027425285459&amount=-$26.33 USD";  I need to fetch value 26.33 as number from this string.. how to get it ?
[17:48:40] <neilpdx> wow three questions at once
[17:49:08] <neilpdx> lemonsparrow, javascript has regex so i would probably choose to use that feature
[17:49:53] <neilpdx> JonelethIrenicus,:  is that jquery?
[17:50:18] <neilpdx> angelica, i'm not ignoring you, but i don't have the answer
[17:50:45] <JonelethIrenicus> neilpdx: buttonVarObj.text("change text")
[17:51:45] <robertmaxrees> lemonsparrow there are a few ways.  http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/ is a personal favorite.
[17:52:26] <robertmaxrees> angelica_ that's a whole lot of extra work for little benefit.
[17:52:42] <lemonsparrow>  var amount = parseFloat(a.split('&')[1].split('=')[1].split('$')[1].split('U')[0].trim());
[17:52:43] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees:
[17:52:54] <robertmaxrees> lemonsparrow yeesh.  that's unreadable as hell.
[17:53:05] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees: :(
[17:53:08] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:53:39] <robertmaxrees> that makes some assumptions, too.
[17:53:46] <JonelethIrenicus> neilpdx: any ideas?
[17:54:15] <angelica_> I'm looking to make this .red div full height of the browser window, and only way I can figure it out is with this jquery - http://jsfiddle.net/83pecdcd/
[17:54:35] <neilpdx> jonelethirenicus: i'm not knowledgeable enough to answer your question, but, i don't see anything related to jquery yet
[17:54:42] <angelica_> It's a little hacky I know, that's why I'm posing the question
[17:54:44] <robertmaxrees> angelica_ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/83pecdcd/1/
[17:55:17] <JonelethIrenicus> neilpdx: http://api.jquery.com/text/
[17:55:37] <robertmaxrees> JonelethIrenicus can you show us a case where you styling is getting busted with jquery?
[17:55:52] <angelica_> Thanks Robert!! :)\
[17:55:52] <angelica_> :)
[17:56:28] <robertmaxrees> sure
[17:58:39] <z1haze_work> With Backbone, does the navigation generally go into a view?
[17:58:46] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:58:49] <robertmaxrees> where else would it go?
[17:58:57] <z1haze_work> just html on the page
[17:59:01] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:59:06] <z1haze_work> would be static
[17:59:07] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you're building it.
[17:59:29] <robertmaxrees> i usually render out at least the shell of the page statically, but you could do it dynamically.
[17:59:37] <z1haze_work> well i've had little time to play with it since the last time you helped me but i remember getting stumped at that point
[17:59:43] <z1haze_work> thats what i want to do i think
[18:00:02] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[18:00:09] <z1haze_work> ffs! lol
[18:04:53] <Forbidd3n> Is there a way to apply css style to all elements except the <header> element or any children/descendants?
[18:08:03] <shoky> yes but that's not something you want to do, ever
[18:08:32] <Forbidd3n> shoky: why not?
[18:08:36] <shoky> apply the same styling to a div and to form inputs inside it?  hmmm..
[18:08:44] <shoky> just one nonsensical example
[18:09:00] <shoky> unless you have an actual legitimate case that i can't think of ;p
[18:09:50] <Forbidd3n> shoky: my issue is I have 4 colors in wordpress customizer settings - primary (h1-h6), secondary (all text other than h1-h6), header primary (header h1-h6), header secondary (all header text other than h1-h6)
[18:10:10] <shoky> that doesn't really mean anything to me ;S
[18:10:28] <Forbidd3n> when I set the primary color it is changing the colors in site and within header
[18:11:02] <Forbidd3n> shoky: not a Wordpress person? If not, you probably won't understand my dilemma.
[18:11:28] <shoky> nope
[18:11:54] <Forbidd3n> nvm then :)
[18:12:43] <shoky> anyways.... this is how you'd do it if you were crazy :)       *:not(header):not(header *) {   ...   }
[18:15:16] <jqnb> Hi. I've got a newbie question about error handling with jquery.
[18:15:27] <jqnb> I have a web app with authentication, and I'd like to add a global error handler that will redirect users to our login page when the server returns a 401. When this happens, I do not want the $.ajax calls' error handler to run, just the global one that will redirect the user.
[18:15:49] <jqnb> From what I can tell I have three options: 1) use .ajaxError, 2) use .ajaxSetup or 3) write a custom wrapper for $.ajax and refactor our code to use that instead of calling $.ajax directly. I don't think 1) will work because the original $.ajax error handler gets called before .ajaxError. Some of our pages show an error pop up for unhandled errors, so basically the user would be the error pop-up and then would be redirect to the login
[18:16:15] <jqnb> As far as 2) the jquery docs recommend against using .ajaxSetup as it could mess with other libraries' use of $.ajax. And I'd like to avoid 3) since that would involve a lot of work. Anyone have suggestions as to how to solve this?
[18:26:07] <shoky> ya, go with 3. there is no other right choice really if you really want this for ajax requests (instead of traditional redirects). any other choice will just make it even harder to change anything else afterwards
[18:26:40] <shoky> and you'll just be back here asking a similar question, but in an even more awkward position ;)
[18:32:22] <JonelethIrenicus> When did jsfiddle become such crap?
[18:32:37] <JonelethIrenicus> doesn't even keep references to jquery or other frameworks i need to enter it in?
[18:32:37] <robertmaxrees> i like it personally.
[18:32:49] <robertmaxrees> huh? it saves them.
[18:33:05] <JonelethIrenicus> yeah you have to enter it in manually?
[18:33:12] <JonelethIrenicus> before it had a drop down list
[18:33:16] <robertmaxrees> it still has taht list.
[18:33:20] <robertmaxrees> click the javascript title.
[18:34:40] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: mine has "External Resources"
[18:35:03] <robertmaxrees> so does mine.  click on the gear icon next to the javascript box title.
[18:35:10] <robertmaxrees> you can do either/or.
[18:35:46] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/eybezb9.png
[18:35:56] <robertmaxrees> then click "frameworks & extensions"
[18:37:05] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: well damn glad you told me that
[18:37:09] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:37:14] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: this whole time i was tyring to use other crappy sites
[18:37:20] <JonelethIrenicus> https://jsfiddle.net/og6gwen1/
[18:37:53] <robertmaxrees> so what's up?
[18:38:08] <JonelethIrenicus> click the button
[18:38:18] <JonelethIrenicus> you will see what i am see
[18:38:36] <jqnb> shoky: I was afraid that would be the answer. Refactor it is I guess :)
[18:44:21] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: any ideas?
[18:46:42] <robertmaxrees> JonelethIrenicus so your problem is that .button() changes the contents of the <a> to include a span.
[18:46:47] <robertmaxrees> but .text() destroys it.
[18:46:58] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: ahh
[18:47:11] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jqueryui.com/button/#option-text
[18:50:26] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: sweet thanks brother
[18:50:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah def
[18:55:52] <Forbidd3n> anyone know why this doesn't work as a multi-selector -- $('body :not(header) *, body :not(header)').css({'color': 'red'});
[18:56:03] <Forbidd3n> this works -- $('body :not(header) *').css({'color': 'red'});
[18:56:13] <Forbidd3n> and this works -- $('body :not(header)').css({'color': 'red'});
[18:56:40] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle real quick?
[18:57:15] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/wx38rz5L/2653/
[18:57:24] <robertmaxrees> well that sure is a fiddle.
[18:57:29] <robertmaxrees> 2653 revisions?
[18:57:53] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I just searched for a ready made jquery fiddle lol
[18:57:59] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[18:58:11] <Forbidd3n> so I didn't have to include the libraries
[18:58:12] <robertmaxrees> so i click the set body button and all but "not in h1" turn red.
[18:58:27] <Forbidd3n> on a fresh load clicking body isn't working as expected
[18:58:37] <robertmaxrees> how should it work?
[18:58:49] <Forbidd3n> correct, and everything should turn red except everything in header tag
[18:59:04] <robertmaxrees> so the h1 outside of the header?
[18:59:21] <Forbidd3n> basically and technically the buttons
[18:59:31] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:00:23] <robertmaxrees> ah - misread that.
[19:00:27] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: my end result is I need to set a font color for all elements except anything in the header
[19:00:49] <Forbidd3n> and then one for just elements within the heder
[19:00:51] <Forbidd3n> header
[19:00:53] <robertmaxrees> so :not() is trying to filter a subset of a selection - you need to attach it to an element or class or something.
[19:01:58] <Forbidd3n> {space}:not(...) is for descendants, no?
[19:02:01] <z1haze> hey
[19:02:10] <z1haze> cool, still here
[19:02:22] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n iirc, no.
[19:02:35] <robertmaxrees> it's a filtering selector - need to give it something to filter.
[19:02:36] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: huh?
[19:02:38] <robertmaxrees> i could have that wrong though.
[19:02:41] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[19:03:12] <z1haze> so robertmaxrees in backbone, you create a 'AppView() then from the initialize method in that is where you create all the sub views? im not pulling this into my brain quite how i want to
[19:03:14] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: but it works if you remove one of the body :not(header) selectors
[19:03:53] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: see here -- https://jsfiddle.net/wx38rz5L/2657/
[19:04:44] <robertmaxrees> weird.  i never really could understand the weirdo custom selectors.
[19:04:51] <robertmaxrees> fwiw https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hppz9673/1/
[19:05:10] <robertmaxrees> or just https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hppz9673/2/ - i get 8 elements in that console log.
[19:06:38] <Forbidd3n> confusing huh?
[19:08:24] <robertmaxrees> aye.
[19:08:29] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer .filter() personally.
[19:08:38] <robertmaxrees> give it a function and call it a day.
[19:30:36] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I am going to break them into header, content and footer ids
[19:31:02] <Forbidd3n> what is the best way to set link color in <div id="header-container"> without changing nested links in h1-h6?
[19:31:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:31:22] <robertmaxrees> you mean change everything except for a tags?
[19:31:25] <robertmaxrees> *h tags?
[19:32:12] <Forbidd3n> change all anchor tags within id="header-container" but not nested in h1-h6 tags
[19:32:24] <robertmaxrees> you using sass?
[19:33:02] <Forbidd3n> no using jquery selectors with wordpress customizer
[19:33:25] <Forbidd3n> I know this isn't correct, but trying to show example - #header-container *:not(h1):not(h2):not(h3):not(h4):not(h5):not(h6) a
[19:34:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd use filter with a function.  $('a').filter(function() { return !$(this).closest('h1').length; }); or something.
[19:35:04] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: any way without a filter?
[19:35:16] <Forbidd3n> just using selectors and maybe :not
[19:35:39] <robertmaxrees> any reason for that?
[19:35:48] <robertmaxrees> like... i have you a servicable solution.
[19:35:51] <Forbidd3n> based on how the Wordpress customizer live preview is working
[19:36:21] <Forbidd3n> what you have is great, but won't work with my use-case
[19:36:24] <robertmaxrees> so your problem is you're trying to do css lookups based on parents, which you can't really do last i checked.
[19:36:41] <robertmaxrees> so you'd have to build stuff out all wonky to get it to work.
[19:37:18] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: just because it is a different method doesn't make it wonky. :)
[19:37:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:38:36] <robertmaxrees> how about more like "you're going to have to build out a relatively unintuitive selector to accomplish this".
[19:38:39] <robertmaxrees> but hey, what would i know.
[19:39:07] <robertmaxrees> wonder if something like $('a:not(h1 a), a:not(:h2 a)') would work.
[19:43:07] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: will give it a try
[19:43:17] <robertmaxrees> which is still wonky, but meh (shrug)
[20:03:48] <z1haze> so robertmaxrees what would it take to get some lessons to get me going on backbone
[20:03:55] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[20:04:00] <robertmaxrees> from me?
[20:04:04] <z1haze> yea
[20:04:09] <robertmaxrees> i don't really have time tbh.
[20:04:13] <robertmaxrees> and you really couldn't afford me hehe.
[20:04:15] <robertmaxrees> *heh
[20:04:25] <z1haze> during our code freeze, probably november, i need to teach this to my people at work
[20:04:35] <z1haze> so if you teach me, i can teach them
[20:04:38] <Darmani> Hey guys, I have a navbar that shows up halfway down the landing page, I want it to be stuck to the top on every other page though. How do I get this to happen?
[20:04:57] <robertmaxrees> Darmani detect which page you're on and conditionally stick it.
[20:05:19] <z1haze> well how about i throw some code on a paste and you can kinda school me through it? would you be able to do that?
[20:05:21] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: oh hey man! ^^
[20:05:38] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i really don't have time to walk you through backbone comprehensively :/
[20:05:51] <robertmaxrees> like, i can occasionally give you feedback.
[20:05:58] <robertmaxrees> but i can't make any guarantees/
[20:05:59] <Darmani> So something like... if page != root, navbar = fixed?
[20:06:09] <robertmaxrees> Darmani sure
[20:06:14] <z1haze> well i just need to lear nthe workflow
[20:06:30] <Darmani> z1haze: You're asking an awful lot from someone on a chatroom lol
[20:06:36] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: thanks man ^^
[20:06:38] <robertmaxrees> have you checked out something like https://www.codeschool.com/courses/anatomy-of-backbone-js ?
[20:06:53] <z1haze> yea paid for a course from udemy
[20:07:04] <z1haze> waste of money. all it does is rebuild the todomvc app
[20:07:16] <robertmaxrees> heh, that should tell you something, but ok./
[20:07:43] <z1haze> sure but all those examples are super basic, they dont have more than one screen
[20:07:51] <z1haze> they have a single main view and nothing changes in it
[20:07:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:08:05] <robertmaxrees> sure things change.
[20:08:08] <robertmaxrees> you enter data.
[20:08:16] <z1haze> sure, its a SINGLE module
[20:08:17] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you don't get live updates from the server?
[20:08:21] <z1haze> no.
[20:08:24] <z1haze> all front end
[20:08:29] <robertmaxrees> then what's the issue?
[20:08:57] <z1haze> well for one if i am on my 'dashboard' page. and i want to switch to my 'settings' page, that is a COMPLETELY different scene
[20:09:12] <z1haze> my disconnect happens with how does that change occur
[20:09:15] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to make it so there's no page reload?
[20:09:20] <z1haze> of course
[20:09:25] <decx> you want a router?
[20:09:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:09:30] <robertmaxrees> that's basically what you need.
[20:09:30] <z1haze> which i have
[20:09:32] <robertmaxrees> a router.
[20:09:47] <robertmaxrees> you then have a base view that's always around and you swap out which view is currently visible.
[20:09:52] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways to do that.
[20:10:04] <z1haze> any decent code example?
[20:10:21] <robertmaxrees> erm, that's one of those cases where you shouldn't really need a code example heh.
[20:10:29] <robertmaxrees> do you know how to expose methods off of views?
[20:10:55] <z1haze> my app is laid out with a main content window, a sidebar, and a top bar .. the sidebar is just the navigation so i want to swap the main content window based on what is clicked in the sidebar
[20:11:03] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[20:11:09] <robertmaxrees> gonna answer my question?
[20:11:10] <robertmaxrees> ")
[20:11:12] <robertmaxrees> *:)
[20:11:25] <z1haze> i probably do know how (maybe) to do what you're asking, I dont dont undersatnd what you're saying
[20:11:41] <decx> if you want backbone examples try setting a timespan for search results from 2010 to 2011
[20:11:45] <decx> ^^
[20:11:46] <z1haze> After playing with this crap for a couple weeks off and on, I could make that todo app on my own without referncing any help
[20:11:54] <robertmaxrees> so when you write a view, you can write methods on thaat view, right?
[20:12:07] <z1haze> yes
[20:12:31] <robertmaxrees> those methods can do all kinds of things.  you could have them, for instance, hide the current view
[20:12:32] <robertmaxrees> or show it.
[20:12:48] <z1haze> hide/show it?
[20:12:55] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[20:13:07] <robertmaxrees> you want to click an item in your navbar and have that load another view, right?
[20:13:12] <z1haze> so i wouldnt be listening to my router and doing new ThisView() when a user clicks a certain page link
[20:13:15] <z1haze> yea
[20:13:28] <robertmaxrees> errr, how do you think your router shows/hides things?
[20:13:45] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could fully instantiate the view on demand and kill off the old one.
[20:13:49] <robertmaxrees> gotta kill the html, too.
[20:13:49] <z1haze> i dont know.. the examples never really use them because they dont have more than one page
[20:14:03] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating what page means.
[20:14:04] <robertmaxrees> *means
[20:14:24] <robertmaxrees> err, i spelled that correctly the first time around hahaha.  either way - stop thinking "page" and start thinking "view"
[20:14:30] <robertmaxrees> views can instantiate other views.
[20:15:06] <z1haze> well i've been thinking it as a view, but when one 'view' is basically the whole page, and another view is another whole page they are completely different..
[20:15:14] <z1haze> its like what you said, show/hide the view
[20:15:17] <robertmaxrees> sure - they're child views.
[20:15:24] <z1haze> i nefver learned this show hide
[20:15:36] <robertmaxrees> the parent view contains the content area and the sidebar nav thinger.
[20:15:44] <robertmaxrees> err, this.$el.addClass('hide')
[20:15:46] <robertmaxrees> done.
[20:16:00] <z1haze> so all of your code is literally on the single page?
[20:16:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:16:26] <robertmaxrees> it'd be in JS files, but yeah you'd basically load up all that js up frontt.
[20:16:53] <z1haze> lets say #container is my main window element
[20:16:58] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: hey what would this look like practically? if page != root, navbar = fixed?
[20:17:09] <z1haze> on the first load i do  new AppView() and the el: is #container, yea?
[20:17:12] <robertmaxrees> Darmani uh, depends on how you're determing what "root" is.
[20:17:17] <robertmaxrees> z1haze sure.
[20:17:32] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: root would be the landing page. But how would I define that with jquery?
[20:17:41] <z1haze> so in the initialize method of my AppView() i new up all of my child views for the 'dashboard' page, right?
[20:17:53] <robertmaxrees> Darmani jquery doesn't determine that for you >.> your server would need to define that.
[20:17:54] <z1haze> like each 'widget' i guess
[20:18:15] <robertmaxrees> z1haze or each "page" would be a view.
[20:18:23] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: My server...? You mean like the url?
[20:18:23] <robertmaxrees> each of those instantiate a series of child views.
[20:18:32] <robertmaxrees> Darmani sure.  or a var on the page.
[20:18:42] <z1haze> ok - let me put it this way
[20:19:10] <z1haze> if you had a dashboard (admin panel) type thing so on first load it loads your dashboard with several widgets, a sidebar navigation, etc - how would you kick off the app
[20:19:10] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: ohh you mean like manually set an anchor?
[20:19:20] <robertmaxrees> Darmani huh?
[20:19:27] <robertmaxrees> Darmani no i mean like a js variable.
[20:19:51] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: right that's what I mean. like if  variables.exists? then do whatever.
[20:19:54] <robertmaxrees> z1haze we already covered this... you have a main app view.  sidebar = another view.  content area = another view.
[20:20:03] <robertmaxrees> Darmani sure.  you can also check the url.
[20:20:07] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways to do it.
[20:20:07] <z1haze> so at the start you instantiate 3 views?
[20:20:18] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: hmm. kk
[20:20:31] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i guess?  your main app view which has 2 children - content and sidebar.
[20:20:39] <z1haze> oh i see
[20:20:53] <z1haze> and each page gets loaded inside content
[20:20:56] <z1haze> 'page'
[20:21:12] <robertmaxrees> which are actually views that you can instantiate on the fly.
[20:21:56] <z1haze> and i dont know if sidebar needs to be an actual view - nothing it in changes
[20:22:02] <robertmaxrees> it'd make it a view.
[20:22:05] <robertmaxrees> *id
[20:22:15] <robertmaxrees> for consistency and sanity's sake.
[20:22:18] <z1haze> and just have an el: #sidebar?
[20:22:20] <z1haze> gotcha
[20:22:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:22:46] <z1haze> does your app use pushstate or hash tags for the urls
[20:22:57] <robertmaxrees> "hash tags"?
[20:23:01] <z1haze> #
[20:23:04] <z1haze> pound sign?
[20:23:05] <robertmaxrees> neither.
[20:23:08] <z1haze> i dont know the proper term
[20:23:12] <robertmaxrees> and url hashes.
[20:23:25] <z1haze> i know ootb backbone uses #
[20:23:30] <robertmaxrees> it can ,yeah.
[20:23:32] <z1haze> but you can enable push state too
[20:23:36] <robertmaxrees> we're not using backbone like that.
[20:23:39] <z1haze> for the routers that is
[20:23:40] <z1haze> oh
[20:23:53] <robertmaxrees> caveat emptor: we're looking to move away from backbone.
[20:23:54] <z1haze> i think i remember you said you dont have an SPA but you use it on each page
[20:24:06] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, didnt you just built the new site with it?
[20:24:25] <robertmaxrees> yep :) and we're looking to migrate away potentially.
[20:24:39] <z1haze> why waste all that time building a new front end when you already want to move
[20:24:49] <robertmaxrees> "waste"?
[20:25:00] <z1haze> i wanted to learn backbone because i read it plays nicely with jquery, and other js frameworks do not
[20:25:37] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[20:25:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying you shouldn't learn it.
[20:26:01] <z1haze> lots of others have
[20:26:03] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[20:26:06] <robertmaxrees> i did, too.
[20:26:14] <robertmaxrees> it's not the only way to solve the problems you have :)
[20:26:19] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices out there at this point.
[20:26:24] <z1haze> yea i know
[20:26:34] <z1haze> i just dont know a lot of vanilla js
[20:26:47] <robertmaxrees> you should really learn imo.
[20:26:47] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: How's this?
[20:26:47] <z1haze> and i dont want to have to learn typescript or whatever angular is written in now
[20:26:48] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/ce00ab3107722f4d3d306b4cb2695e3e
[20:26:57] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't learn angular personally.
[20:27:10] <robertmaxrees> Darmani where's getUrlParameter defined?
[20:27:22] <z1haze> may I ask why? i find a major pro to angular being its probably going to live longer than any of those other frameworks
[20:27:37] <robertmaxrees> angular is the best java framework ever written in javascript ;)
[20:27:44] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: oh shit I thought it was part of the core library lol
[20:28:00] <robertmaxrees> z1haze react is going to last for a looooong time.
[20:28:04] <robertmaxrees> Darmani ;)
[20:28:14] <z1haze> what do you base that on?
[20:28:25] <decx> facebook needs it to run their shit
[20:28:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:28:36] <z1haze> what if they move to angular
[20:28:39] <robertmaxrees> they won't.
[20:28:47] <decx> they built react
[20:28:51] <z1haze> oh
[20:28:55] <z1haze> cool
[20:28:55] <robertmaxrees> and react-native.
[20:28:58] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: how would you define the root_path?
[20:29:02] <Darmani> heelpppp meeeeeeee
[20:29:17] <robertmaxrees> uh... i don't know your site at all.  is it just when you hit whatever.com/ ?
[20:29:26] <Darmani> yeah
[20:29:29] <z1haze> so what is a pro of react vs angular2
[20:29:33] <Darmani> just a standard root path
[20:29:59] <robertmaxrees> if (window.location.pathname === '/') { /* homepage */ }
[20:30:20] <Darmani> ohhhhhhhhhhh
[20:30:23] <Darmani> cool.
[20:30:32] <robertmaxrees> z1haze much more "javascript-y".  virtual DOM.  really encourages clean state manegement.
[20:30:40] <robertmaxrees> fast.  reads better imo.
[20:31:17] <robertmaxrees> fwiw react and angular isn't really a fair comparison.  react is your view layer.  angular is the entire framework.
[20:32:09] <z1haze> arent they both frontend frameworks
[20:32:19] <robertmaxrees> react is a frontent library for your view layer only.
[20:32:34] <z1haze> so no models?
[20:32:51] <robertmaxrees> or controllers.  you use other libs for those.
[20:33:00] <robertmaxrees> angular is a full-blown MVVW
[20:33:12] <z1haze> what would you consider backbone then
[20:33:18] <z1haze> it has models and views
[20:33:28] <robertmaxrees> and controllers.
[20:33:32] <robertmaxrees> so it'd be an MVC
[20:33:56] <robertmaxrees> backbone to angular is a more apt comparison.
[20:33:56] <z1haze> i thought the view is considered the controller
[20:34:03] <robertmaxrees> wat
[20:34:06] <Darmani> z1haze: bruh
[20:34:13] <robertmaxrees> oh i see what you're saying.
[20:34:18] <Darmani> you gotta do some reading my friend.
[20:34:25] <z1haze> for backbone..
[20:34:45] <robertmaxrees> z1haze yeah, sorry, it kind of leaves the controller part up to you.
[20:35:01] <robertmaxrees> at the end of the day, there are tons of options.  i'd really suggest reading up on all of them.
[20:35:04] <decx> basicly frontend has been going away from monoliths, that's why there are 5billion words that confuse everyone that looks into it for the first time
[20:35:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:35:18] <robertmaxrees> you have a lot of choices available.
[20:35:30] <robertmaxrees> which can feel daunting.  imo just pick one and learn it.
[20:35:43] <robertmaxrees> then you can start to understand the differences between each of the,./
[20:35:45] <robertmaxrees> *them
[20:35:58] <robertmaxrees> until you actually use one, you can't really understand what makes them different.
[20:36:16] <decx> just check a few of the "project in a box" packages like "create react app" or "vue cli"
[20:36:20] <robertmaxrees> honestly i'd just fully do your POC, dirty hacks and all, and go from there.
[20:36:34] <z1haze> i've heard good things of vuejs
[20:36:42] <z1haze> at least from the laravel community
[20:36:48] <decx> yeah it's great
[20:37:05] <robertmaxrees> some people really like it, yeah.
[20:37:16] <z1haze> decx, do you use it?
[20:37:21] <decx> ye
[20:37:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:37:53] <robertmaxrees> inb4 z1haze tries to make this into a vue support channek.
[20:37:55] <robertmaxrees> *channel
[20:38:08] <z1haze> lol
[20:38:24] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, just do a full POC in whatever you've got.
[20:38:31] <robertmaxrees> finish what you've got now and go from there.
[20:38:51] <z1haze> i dont have shit now :)
[20:38:55] <robertmaxrees> wait
[20:38:57] <z1haze> i have my api
[20:39:01] <robertmaxrees> have you written any frontend code?
[20:39:05] <z1haze> hardly
[20:39:08] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:39:13] <z1haze> every time i get started i get stuck
[20:39:20] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[20:39:37] <robertmaxrees> have you even tried making like one page work?
[20:39:54] <z1haze> of course
[20:40:00] <z1haze> i can do that
[20:40:14] <robertmaxrees> then do it and keep going from there.
[20:40:47] <z1haze> i had this history widget working, but i couldnt figure out how to make backbone retreive from a paginated endpoint like ?page=5
[20:41:34] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/backbone-paginator/backbone.paginator
[20:41:46] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10470481/pagination-in-backbone-js
[20:42:02] <robertmaxrees> lots of relevant results in a quick google search.
[20:43:00] <z1haze> that looks like it gets the whole collection and stores it on the frontend and paginates it there
[20:43:13] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices available.
[20:43:20] <robertmaxrees> gotta learn to google and read.
[20:45:10] <z1haze> are all of the 'views' stored in a main index file
[20:45:24] <z1haze> i couldnt really understand how to organize the js views
[20:45:29] <robertmaxrees> for backbone?
[20:45:32] <z1haze> agh sorry, templates*
[20:45:36] <z1haze> yea
[20:45:55] <robertmaxrees> really depends on how you choose to handle them.
[20:46:02] <robertmaxrees> you could store them all server-side and pull them as needed.
[20:46:07] <robertmaxrees> or inline them if you want
[20:46:23] <robertmaxrees> there's no single answer that suits every situation for something like that.
[20:46:31] <z1haze> i was going to use the underscore templates or handlebars templates
[20:46:45] <z1haze> so they are all just is <script> tags on the page
[20:46:59] <robertmaxrees> you can still store those server-side as .js files and call those via ajax and render on the fly.
[20:47:05] <robertmaxrees> or store them in script tags on-page
[20:47:20] <robertmaxrees> just gotta be somewhere you can make them into a string
[20:47:40] <z1haze> i was told they can be anything except js
[20:47:56] <z1haze> they have to be of some other type than javascript
[20:48:04] <robertmaxrees> in script tags yeah.
[20:48:16] <z1haze> i had a cool idea where i would load them on demand like you just said, i wasnt sure if that was something people did
[20:48:23] <robertmaxrees> sure.  why not?
[20:48:24] <ragas> helo
[20:48:39] <z1haze> my idea was just do have a templates file on the server that i would load in, grab the id of the templatei want and use it
[20:48:51] <robertmaxrees> sure.  that's one way.
[20:48:53] <z1haze> is there a jquery method that can load() and return a specific element
[20:48:58] <z1haze> by its ID
[20:49:02] <robertmaxrees> sure, but i wouldn't do it like that.
[20:49:26] <z1haze> of course not :\
[20:49:27] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of extra overhead for templating.
[20:49:40] <robertmaxrees> make a json file of the templates.
[20:49:42] <robertmaxrees> much cleaner.
[20:49:53] <z1haze> not following on that
[20:50:13] <z1haze> my teampltes look nothing like json
[20:50:16] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:50:45] <robertmaxrees> { "headerTemplate": "<div id='header'><%= headercontent %></div>"}
[20:50:49] <robertmaxrees> etc
[20:51:01] <z1haze> uh
[20:51:15] <z1haze> doesnt seem very readable/managable
[20:51:23] <decx> the whole point of a spa is to frontload function until you reach a certain threshold of complexity
[20:51:25] <robertmaxrees> or store them individually on your server in separate files.
[20:51:34] <robertmaxrees> you have a lot of options.
[20:51:48] <robertmaxrees> it all depends on the needs of the appication and the tradeoffs you want to make.
[20:52:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd really suggest hitting up #web at this point since this has really started to hijack the channel heh.
[20:52:24] <decx> wait we're in #jquery
[20:52:32] <z1haze> ..
[20:52:33] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:52:37] <z1haze> it is jquery
[20:52:47] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[20:52:53] <decx> i was wondering why ja wasnt throwing abuse
[20:53:02] <ragas> Helo - I have a page contain multiple dynamically generated forms, and tried to create handlers for them by iterating over the script and inserting some php for the form ID's.  the purpose is to use ajax to submit the forms.   I'm getting a 500 error.  can this work?
[20:53:04] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[20:53:16] <robertmaxrees> ragas huh?
[20:53:21] <robertmaxrees> ragas not following.
[20:55:10] <ragas> for(i=0;i<4;i++);   <script>>$("<? echo row[i]  ?>").submit()</script>
[20:55:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:55:26] <robertmaxrees> wut.
[20:55:31] <arc_> o_o
[20:55:44] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to do a bunch of submit handlers?
[20:55:48] <robertmaxrees> so you can submit via javascript?
[20:55:53] <robertmaxrees> err, ajax
[20:56:20] <ragas> i think thats what i said in the first place
[20:56:33] <robertmaxrees>  <script>>$("<? echo row[i]  ?>").submit()</script> would try to submit the forms immediately.
[20:56:49] <robertmaxrees> and you don't need to use unique IDs here - use a single delegated listener for them.
[20:57:35] <ragas> how do i get multiple forms to submit with the same handler?  is there a class handler?
[20:57:35] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[20:57:41] <robertmaxrees> you can use classes,too.
[20:57:50] <robertmaxrees> $('.someClass').on('submit', function() {});
[20:58:19] <ragas> ok, thanks, robertmaxrees
[20:59:39] <robertmaxrees> sure
[21:00:29] <lurkashf1ake> I have a form which contain only 1 input field when I press enter it send the data to a new page... I want to stop it from reloading the page and get the value to a function where I can use it
[21:00:46] <robertmaxrees> lurkashf1ake use an even handler.
[21:00:53] <robertmaxrees> *event
[21:01:19] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).find('input').val(); });
[21:01:21] <robertmaxrees> or w/eo
[21:01:47] <lurkashf1ake> ++
[21:11:47] <lurkashf1ake> http://pastebin.com/2KAdk6mp
[21:11:52] <lurkashf1ake> the event doesn't get handled
[21:12:29] <lurkashf1ake> it just reload the page with the suffix "/?"
[21:18:04] <lurkashf1ake> it looks fine?
[22:14:59] <Darmani> Hi guys, I want my navbar to appear before any other elements on a page. Am I doing it right?
