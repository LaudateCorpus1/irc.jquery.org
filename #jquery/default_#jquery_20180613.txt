[00:12:21] <artemisiaaa> can someone help me with some math stuff? I have this snipped I'm trying to change but I can't get it right
[00:12:27] <artemisiaaa> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/jKwOLp
[00:12:53] <artemisiaaa> it should start at 27040 on the specified date and increment by 0.00462963 every second
[00:13:06] <artemisiaaa> been killing myself trying to get it to work!
[00:40:53] <ryan_ford> i think the Math.ceil is messing it up
[00:41:26] <artemisiaaa> ya :s
[02:00:50] <Cork> um, where is it increasing by the fractional?
[02:01:06] <Cork> the number is ceiled so it is always increased by 1
[02:01:54] <Cork> ah, now i see CountPopInterval isn't modified
[02:02:41] <Cork> though it is ceil so the end result is still the same
[03:19:32] <sgs> Hi all. I wonder of there is a standard function (functionality) that let's one convert a number like 10000 to "10 000" (1000 -> "1 000", etc)?
[03:20:36] <Cork> no there isn't
[03:20:59] <Cork> there are a lot of libs that does it though
[03:22:19] <Cork> like ex. http://numeraljs.com/
[03:25:24] <Cork> sgs: or you can use something like (10000).toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/, " ")
[03:26:39] <sgs> Cork: Thanks! :)
[03:29:05] <Cork> sgs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString is another option
[04:35:32] <rocketmagnet> hi everyone
[04:36:13] <rocketmagnet> when loading page data with $.ajax(), is there a way i can do it with a http get so the <?php ?> code gets executed ?
[04:37:08] <AdamPDotty> You work in client, you call server server handles php.
[04:38:54] <Cork> rocketmagnet: if <?php ?> doesn't get executed, the file extension isn't .php, or the server doesn't support php
[04:40:35] <rocketmagnet> hmm... i load menu_xy.php with the following code: https://pastebin.com/0hTXtcj8
[04:40:35] <WALL-E> rocketmagnet: In order to help you better, please demonstrate your issue with a minimal amount of code here: http://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/jquery - replace the HTML/CSS/JavaScript with your test case, click "Fork" at the left top and share the URL here.
[04:40:53] <Cork> (ignore the bot)
[04:41:04] <rocketmagnet> maybe i've to alter dataType: 'text' to something different
[04:41:10] <Cork> no
[04:41:28] <Cork> if you get <?php in the response it means the server doesn't support php
[04:41:38] <rocketmagnet> oh
[04:41:41] <rocketmagnet> i try
[04:42:32] <rocketmagnet> you're right
[04:42:36] <rocketmagnet> hmpf
[04:42:42] <rocketmagnet> but thanks alot
[04:43:15] <rocketmagnet> i'm stupid sometimes but i was not sure they ways you can fetch data with xmlhttprequest (the name includes it...)
[04:43:59] <Cork> rocketmagnet: dataType just affects the accept header in the http request
[04:44:18] <Cork> rocketmagnet: you should never ever get server code in the response as long as the server supports the language
[04:44:46] <Cork> (well except for a few languages leak it when they crash)
[05:16:37] <Dro> Hello, how can I check if a div have sub div that contain a class X?
[05:20:44] <AdamPDotty> "contain a class" …
[05:21:17] <AdamPDotty> Maybe you want div.find('div.X').length.
[05:30:28] <Cork> ya, or $('.X').closest('#the-div') depending on what type of selection you need to do
[06:31:55] <iaj> Hi there :)
[06:32:54] <iaj> can someone give me a hint, when I want to simulate the kick of a ball with a mouse like "goal wall shooting" is there anything that comes to mind that I could use for that/
[06:38:42] <iaj>  
[06:41:10] <z3l> http://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/221330/ how to select only Strona główna ?
[06:43:47] <z3l> http://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/221330/ how to select only Strona główna ? and not 1, 2, 3.
[06:44:02] <z3l> http://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/221330/ how to select only the first Strona główna ? and not 1, 2, 3.
[07:02:16] <z3l> anyone ?
[07:17:07] <Cork> z3l: all of them or what?
[07:17:18] <Cork> or do you mean the id?
[07:36:42] <z3l> I mean only the first a element, saying "Strona główna" and not its 1,2,3 a elements.
[07:37:39] <Cork> i would recommend adding a class or something not content related to the a tag to select on
[07:37:49] <z3l> Thank you.
[07:38:01] <Cork> selecting on text in the content is both slow and buggy
[07:39:16] <Cork> z3l: alternatively you can do something like http://jsfiddle.net/1k8nsp4o/
[07:39:25] <Cork> though that isn't exactly flexible either
[07:57:25] <sine0> guys when trying to trigger via scroll, for a sticky navbar, do you normally set a certain amount of pixels down before it triggers ?
[07:58:06] <Cork> sine0: have you tried using position: sticky?
[07:58:42] <Cork> doing it through scroll will always flicker as scroll events are async so things will miss the location you want (scrolled too far)
[07:59:38] <sine0> Cork: I want to do it and add a class at the same time to change background color and do transition animation
[07:59:48] <sine0> from what I have seen alot of it is done with js/jq
[08:00:15] <Cork> ya, but note that you will always have to allow pixel fuzzing as events won't fire exactly
[08:00:25] <sine0> So I could use position sticky and then have the onscroll trigger the addclass right
[08:00:38] <Cork> ya, that is an option
[08:00:46] <Cork> or you can use the newer tricks
[08:00:55] <Cork> (one min)
[08:01:58] <Cork> sine0: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1656#issuecomment-359963820
[08:02:35] <sine0> ok I think I just want to use this absolute position and jjust have the scroll trigger addclass for resize and bag color
[08:02:59] <sine0> for some reason I cant get github pages at the moment
[08:03:11] <sine0> I dont have a firewall..
[08:03:30] <Cork> it will affect the smoothness of the page though (as onscroll events force browsers into legacy mode so scrolling and resizing works less smoothly)
[08:04:16] <Cork> note i'm not saying to to do it that way, just that there are consequences
[08:05:03] <sine0> thanks im sure i will check them all out as i want to crack this
[08:05:16] <sine0> i normally have multipe little folders with test sites
[08:05:24] <sine0> aka a mess
[08:26:52] <sine0> hey folks, when you do something like .class > img how do you do that in addClass in jQuery
[08:30:40] <z3l> http://77.253.182.109/tmp/18/18.html , guys how can I make the dropdown not go after hover is out on the first one of Strona glowna
[08:33:54] <Woet> z3l: "not go after hover is out on the first one of Strona glowna"
[08:33:59] <Woet> z3l: that makes zero sense.
[08:34:12] <z3l> Woet: The dropdown menu dissapears.
[08:34:47] <Woet> z3l: look at one of the many many dropdown scripts to get some ideas
[08:34:56] <Woet> z3l: you don't need JS for it btw, CSS will do just fine
[08:36:40] <Cork> sine0: add class runs on the result of the selector, not in addClass
[08:38:05] <Cork> z3l: are you asking why the dropdown is visible all the time? (kinda hard to guess what you're asking)
[08:39:20] <Woet> Cork: he's changing the code since he asked the question
[08:39:29] <Cork> ah
[08:39:30] <Woet> Cork: originally the dropdown disappeared as soon as you took your mouse off the link
[08:39:54] <Cork> so he's trying to make a popdown menu?
[08:40:01] <Woet> yup
[08:40:09] <Woet> the thing that has been solved for like 15 years I think
[08:40:16] <Cork> more like 20
[08:40:30] <Cork> i wrote a site doing it in 97-98
[08:40:47] <Cork> had to use tables and a tags all over but ... :D
[08:41:03] <Cork> it is basically the same solution for the same problem
[08:41:48] <Cork> (pre ie 5.5 didn't have hover on anything other then a tags, and absolute position didn't work reliably without a table)
[08:42:00] <Cork> uh, pre ie6 i mean :)
[08:47:48] <Cork> z3l: just a quick demo http://jsfiddle.net/xomvzyLe/5/
[08:47:57] <Cork> no styling included :)
[08:48:30] <Cork> opps forgot the position absolute :x
[08:50:27] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/xomvzyLe/7/
[09:21:25] <jak2000> hi all
[09:25:27] <jak2000> i have 3 selects, cerated at runtime only with class named 'selStatus' if i set the value: $(".selStatus").val(datos[wxi].status2);  but the 3 selects was ssetted the last value: datos[wxi].status2 how to fix it? (i want each select set the value of: datos[wxi].status2 )   in this case the 3 was different any advice?
[09:29:08] <Cork> jak2000: https://jsfiddle.net/ptLn69s7/1/
[09:29:42] <Cork> hmm actually val should work https://jsfiddle.net/ptLn69s7/3/
[09:29:50] <Cork> jak2000: so what exactly is the problem?
[09:35:04] <jak2000> checking
[09:35:52] <jak2000> i wait: 1) A 2) B 3) A
[09:36:18] <Cork> jak2000: reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[09:36:25] <jak2000> how to, without id
[09:36:37] <Cork> do what?
[09:36:44] <jak2000> ok
[09:39:28] <jak2000> see: https://jsfiddle.net/ptLn69s7/8/
[09:39:42] <jak2000> the 3 select option have last value...
[09:40:04] <Cork> $(arr).each is not valid
[09:44:54] <Cork> jak2000: https://jsfiddle.net/ptLn69s7/15/
[09:45:06] <jak2000> i used a code sample for create a select option,
[09:46:35] <jak2000> ok, interesting.
[09:46:40] <jak2000> thanks
[09:56:59] <Cork> jak2000: $('', {}) has some special access objects so text, html, val is the same as .val() .text(), .html()
[09:57:09] <Cork> so the extra things you did wasn't needed
[09:57:43] <Cork> and $().each() is only for looping elements $.each(obj, func()) is for looping objects or arrays
[09:58:36] <Cork> jak2000: and thirdly don't append a new parent element to the dom before you're done with appending to it (it causes a lot of extra work for the browser if you do)
[09:59:13] <Cork> that is why i moved the appendTo to after the $.each loop
[09:59:15] <jak2000> ok
[09:59:17] <jak2000> understand
[09:59:40] <Cork> that said this can be cleaned up a bit more :P
[10:00:13] <jak2000> not understand: sel.appendTo('body').val('2');
[10:00:25] <Cork> sel is the select element
[10:00:35] <Cork> .val('2') sets '2' to the element
[10:00:46] <Cork> .appendTo() doesn't modify what element you work on
[10:02:04] <jak2000> can i set value refering to class selStatus?
[10:02:22] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[10:02:37] <Cork> you mean you want to set all elements to the same value?
[10:03:46] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/ptLn69s7/21/
[10:04:42] <Cork> heh https://jsfiddle.net/ptLn69s7/22/
[10:05:20] <Cork> jak2000: do you mean you want to create new elements that don't have the class selStatus and set the value based on an old element with the class?
[10:08:41] <jak2000> i want set the value specify the class
[10:08:51] <jak2000> but individually values
[10:09:17] <Cork> so you want to loop the elements after they are created?
[10:09:24] <jak2000> yes
[10:09:28] <jak2000> loop and set the value
[10:09:51] <Cork> $('.selStatus').each(function() { this.value = something; });
[10:10:14] <jak2000> $('.selStatus').each(function() { this.value = 2; });
[10:10:20] <Cork> will sett all to 2
[10:10:34] <Cork> you need to pick what element should be what based on something
[10:11:12] <Cork> and i'm vague here cause, well you haven't said what it should be based on
[10:13:00] <jak2000> see: https://jsfiddle.net/ptLn69s7/25/
[10:13:23] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/ptLn69s7/27/   :(
[10:13:47] <Cork> doesn't really tell me what you want to do
[10:13:57] <Cork> all classes has the class selstatus
[10:14:19] <Cork> so setting all elements with the class to the same value will, well reset all of them to the value you set the last
[10:14:26] <jak2000> undersstand
[10:14:33] <jak2000> well i need retink the logic.
[10:14:35] <Cork> so, again what are you trying to do?
[10:14:53] <Cork> what i gave you before should do what you want
[10:15:07] <Cork> as it sets the value of the element before you append it to the dom
[10:15:12] <Cork> so each one gets the value you want
[10:15:31] <jak2000> i think need different class
[10:15:52] <Cork> why do you think you need to select it again to set the value?
[10:16:12] <Cork> you already have the element, why do you need to get it from a selector?
[10:16:29] <Cork> THAT is where the needed data is lost
[10:16:44] <Cork> or missing might be a better wording :)
[10:17:15] <jak2000> yes understand.
[10:17:27] <jak2000> need each class for diferent status.
[10:17:44] <Cork> no, you need to give each _element_ a different status
[10:17:57] <jak2000> yes yes
[10:17:58] <Cork> what i'm missing is why they need to have different classes
[10:18:08] <Cork> or why you need to reselect them
[10:18:15] <jak2000> i have 4 diferent status...
[10:18:20] <Cork> ok, and?
[10:18:29] <jak2000> 1 class for each status and solve the problem,
[10:18:34] <jak2000> not right but.. solve
[10:18:45] <jak2000> this is beautiful: <Cork> no, you need to give each _element_ a different status
[10:18:51] <Cork> but why do you need to create the element, append it and then select it again?
[10:19:09] <Cork> why not just set the value based on the element you created?
[10:19:25] <Cork> that is where you're losing me
[10:19:49] <charolastra> how consistent is the behavior of AJAX requests across different browers? safari behaves retardedly here, sending OPTIONS requests on multipart/form-data, etc ...
[10:20:19] <Cork> charolastra: its is very consistent, options is if you go cross domain
[10:20:42] <Cork> (only get is allowed cross domain without OPTIONS)
[10:20:56] <charolastra> all the other browsers just do a regular GET. and only older safari does that
[10:21:24] <Cork> charolastra: no browser does a get before a multipart for post...
[10:21:32] <Cork> *form
[10:22:05] <charolastra> in response to. the POST response is a 302
[10:22:19] <Cork> ya, and the post is what causes the OPTIONS
[10:22:50] <charolastra> after the POST is sent out???
[10:23:09] <Cork> is the POST cross domain, yes
[10:23:41] <charolastra> what's the point of that? and why doesn't FF, chrome, etc. to that?
[10:23:48] <Cork> OPTIONS is the browser asking the server if it is allowed to do a changing request from the domain it is coming from to the other domain
[10:24:07] <Cork> and all browsers does it
[10:24:29] <Cork> the only difference might be that you end up on a different domain for safari
[10:24:33] <Cork> or a different port or...
[10:25:43] <charolastra> same domain, same port. only see an OPTIONS request on safari. wouldn't it send the OPTIONS as a preflight _before_ the POST?
[10:26:36] <Cork> it would yes
[10:26:46] <Cork> is the 302 on the same domain/port?
[10:27:04] <Cork> meaning the 302 location: header
[10:27:21] <charolastra> and the documentations says this: "Note: For cross-domain requests, setting the content type to anything other than application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain will trigger the browser to send a preflight OPTIONS request to the server." so it seems that a multipart/form-data won't cause it
[10:27:49] <Cork> that isn't true
[10:28:03] <Cork> might be true for the same domain in some browser
[10:28:14] <Cork> but cross domain anything other then get causes an OPTIONS
[10:28:55] <Cork> charolastra: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Preflighted_requests
[10:31:31] <charolastra> 302 is on same domain/port as the target of the POST request. but the issue is that all browsers do the POST and nearly all then do a GET on the 302 Location header in the response of the POST. but safari on an older ipad does an OPTIONS request instead
[10:32:16] <Cork> charolastra: old old, browsers allowed 302 in a post to do a post
[10:32:41] <Cork> that has been depricated cause it allowed security bypass
[10:32:50] <Cork> and now days no browser allow that
[10:33:09] <Cork> so depending on how far back in browsers you go, cors handling will change
[10:34:19] <charolastra> this is iOS 9.3.5 btw. which is only 2 years old
[10:36:39] <Cork> charolastra: have you checked so it isn't from http to https for example?
[10:43:24] <charolastra> yeah, all https. the mozilla link says this btw: "Or if the Content-Type header has a value other than the following: multipart/form-data"
[10:44:18] <Cork> ya, but don't miss the "Or" part
[10:44:30] <Cork> meaning if it is GET AND content-type is
[10:47:40] <charolastra> content-type other than those listed. which is consistend to the jquery documentation and from the behaviour i'm observing of most browsers
[10:47:55] <Cork> again for GET ya
[11:08:42] <charolastra> a little above a 'simple request' gets defined as POST with multipart/form-data
[11:42:31] <Xorg> guys im stuck in loop

[14:32:59] <digimer> hello. I'm new to jquery, and I'm having trouble with something simple... I have a hidden form field in my HTML like this: <input type="hidden" name="interface_list" id="interface_list" value="bcn1_link1,bcn1_link2,ifn1_link1,ifn1_link2" />
[14:33:08] <digimer> To verify that I can read it, I use this: console.log('Interface list: ['+$('#interface_list').text()+'].');
[14:33:23] <digimer> When it runs though, it logs this: Interface list: [].
[14:33:33] <digimer> can someone help me figure out what I am doing wrong?
[14:43:33] <jcrawford> is there something special I need to do in order to get the value? form.serialize() is not picking up on the changed value
[14:45:47] <jcrawford> my bad nevermind
