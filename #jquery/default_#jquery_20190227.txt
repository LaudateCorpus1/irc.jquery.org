[02:13:24] <LucaVanzin> Hello to all. Sorry I'm a noob on Jquery, but I have a small jquery script that read a songle line file and put the result in a tag used in a html page. I would like now add more lines to the file IO.htm and use the script to populate more tags.
[02:13:50] <LucaVanzin> Could you kindly address me on how to prooced? This is the script https://pastebin.com/2y7NP6L5
[02:18:40] <Cork> LucaVanzin: i strongly recommend NOT to use setInterval around net connections
[02:18:54] <Cork> it will trigger every half a second even if the server takes a while to anwer
[02:19:15] <Cork> and then you will start triggering 2,3,4,5... requiests at a time
[02:19:33] <Cork> so instead use a function and call it again inside the response with setTimeout
[02:20:23] <Cork> (function update() { $.get("url").done(update).always(function() { setTimeout(update, 500); }); })();
[02:21:01] <Cork> LucaVanzin: about having more then one response per request, i would recommend using a .json file instead of html
[02:21:15] <Cork> then you can give an array as response and do what you want with that
[02:21:39] <LucaVanzin> Good morning Cork, Thankyou for answer. This script reside inside a industrial server PLC. I think Jquery is a client side script so i't ok anyway?
[02:22:02] <Cork> ok, but the answer still stands
[02:22:08] <Cork> you can have disk latency or what ever
[02:22:21] <Cork> when you use ajax, you should never use setInterval
[02:23:48] <LucaVanzin> ok. I don't know if the PLC can handle json, since the IO.htm is used as placeholder to the PLC where he write soome internal variable values
[02:24:30] <LucaVanzin> What the Jquery script get is not the label text, but the internal value of the PLC variable
[02:26:03] <Cork> LucaVanzin: well then your limitation is most likely more what the server can give you then what you can do with javascript
[02:26:04] <LucaVanzin> Cork, thankyou for the function provided, could you kindly tell me where I can get the result as string and split lines into array to get the values?
[02:26:31] <LucaVanzin> Cork, absolutely.. server inside PLC is very limited
[02:26:31] <Cork> LucaVanzin: you would have to provide an example of what you get from the server
[02:26:48] <Cork> (not the content if you don't want, but the format)
[02:27:52] <LucaVanzin> actually is a base type as integer, but in the project I have to handle time of day, integers and I would like to handle also strings
[02:28:08] <Cork> js isn't typed
[02:30:25] <LucaVanzin> Cork, ops sorry i was not aware of that
[02:30:40] <LucaVanzin> https://pasteboard.co/I34afTZ.png this is what I gget actually
[02:30:49] <Cork> ugg not a picture...
[02:32:02] <LucaVanzin> this is the html page https://pastebin.com/BzrQGmqF
[02:32:35] <Cork> ok, and you want to grab the tr?
[02:32:36] <LucaVanzin> Cork, picture doesn't load?
[02:32:57] <Cork> i always expect ppl to send picture of code or content
[02:33:02] <Cork> and then it is completely useless
[02:33:58] <LucaVanzin> the picture show the result with the data showed
[02:34:12] <Cork> ya, i need to format not a picture of it
[02:35:24] <LucaVanzin> the code is in the lartter post.. Then.. i would to put all the placeholder for the PLC in the same file and grab them with a Jquery with a refresh of a 500ms-1sec
[02:35:39] <Cork> so...
[02:35:42] <Cork> ok, and you want to grab the tr? <--
[02:36:27] <LucaVanzin> every tr contain a td in where I would to put the separated data
[02:36:40] <LucaVanzin> every tr contain MORE td in where I would to put the separated data
[02:36:55] <Cork> so the tr doesn't have a meaning?
[02:37:25] <LucaVanzin> I use only for to ceparate data in rows
[02:37:33] <Cork> ...
[02:37:38] <Cork> so it doesn't have a meaning?
[02:38:02] <LucaVanzin> sorry but I can't grasp your question...
[02:38:17] <Cork> does the tr have a meaning for the data in the html file
[02:38:34] <Cork> or is it just for structuring the output graphically
[02:38:56] <Cork> if matters for how you would have to parse the content after the request
[02:39:01] <LucaVanzin> Ah ok.. yes.. tr is relates to an actuator. every td in the line is relates to a value of that actuator
[02:39:20] <Cork> ...
[02:39:36] <Cork> so you want to loop the tr then?
[02:39:42] <Cork> you give mixed messages here...
[02:41:21] <LucaVanzin> sorry if can't explain better... all the tr in the inner table follow the same structure, td in the same column are the same format
[02:41:43] <Cork> LucaVanzin: you said you want to handle multiple rows
[02:41:52] <Cork> but you haven't explained what that would be
[02:42:02] <LucaVanzin> Maybe I can't understand your question. Yes, multiple rows in the IO.htm file
[02:42:07] <Cork> you want to process each td on its own, or each tr on its own
[02:42:20] <Cork> ya, but what do you mean by row...
[02:42:24] <Cork> tr?
[02:44:00] <LucaVanzin> I want to read all the lines in the  IO.htm, give an id to each readed data. then put that data in the html file through <label id="dataxx"
[02:44:36] <Cork> so you want to read it as unstructured text blob and not an html dom?
[02:44:48] <Cork> (not sure why...)
[02:45:50] <LucaVanzin> IO.htm doesn't contain html, but values in text format
[02:46:07] <Cork> ... then why did you show me an htnl file for the data >_<
[02:46:43] <LucaVanzin> this is what the PLC expext to replace the placeholder with the internal data
[02:47:24] <LucaVanzin> :="WebData".HourCounter_Zone1: is a plceholder for the PLC. It replace this with the associated internal data
[02:47:44] <LucaVanzin> In the picture is a numes, as you can see
[02:47:53] <LucaVanzin> number*, sorry
[02:52:11] <LucaVanzin> so, Cork can your scrip read all IO.htm text and in what point I would intercept the text and parse lines into an array?
[03:56:31] <shadowswalker> Hello guys, I have to add filter on datatable with data fetch from api call, any tutorial
[04:22:27] <Cork> shadowswalker: i don't think there is many datatables users here; at least i haven't seen many
[05:16:30] <tneva82> urgh. I have bunch of inputs with time field. There's hidden div with another empty form to be used to add forms dynamically. I copy that, change ID's and then call $(".time").datetimepicker({timeOnly: true}); again. The input elements with time class have the hasDatePicker class but the new ones don't seem to have events. Problem seems to come the empty form has already once been called for
[05:17:31] <Cork> tneva82: you can't clone an element that have a timepicker on it if i remeber correctly
[05:17:44] <tneva82> oh crap
[05:17:45] <Cork> cause it will have data assosiated to it from the old element
[07:03:14] <sine0> Hi gang. I want to have a small banner pop up on the footer after a little bit of scrolling, however I dont want it to show on mobile view. from speaking in here before I Was told that its hard to detect browser width or mobile view. shall I just use a media query to hide it on mobile size?
[07:06:00] <Cork> sine0: you can use the ua sniffing, but that is normally a bad idea
[07:06:17] <Cork> and size; modern mobiles has larger resolutions then many desktops
[07:07:58] <Cork> sine0: though, you do show it on scroll you said?
[07:08:12] <Cork> you could on touchstart set a value and not show it if it is true
[07:08:23] <Cork> though that will fail on laptops with touch screens
[07:08:44] <Cork> so ya, there are many ways, none that are really good
[07:09:46] <Cork> but i think i would use touchstart as a solution
[07:10:20] <sine0> what about just hiding it and let jquery do its thing on an invisible section or disabled \w
[07:10:42] <Cork> how would that help with detecting mobile?
[07:11:09] <sine0> im only detecting mobile to show it or now, i could use the media query to apply a class to hide it
[07:11:37] <Cork> sine0: ya, but the problem is you can't really detect mobiles with media queries
[07:12:03] <Cork> (at least if you want to support more then just the most common devices)
[07:17:37] <sine0> im concerned with screen width
[07:17:45] <sine0> if its a phone and has a high resolution thats fine
[07:17:59] <sine0> media queries have worked fine for all my usecases since time began
[07:18:00] <Cork> ah, well then its fine
[07:18:12] <Cork> ya, then i would just use a media query and be done with it
[07:18:13] <sine0> because with the resoution the font will adjust
[07:18:50] <Cork> (you didn't say why you didn't want to show it for mobiles, so i thought it wasn't relevant there)
[07:39:08] <sine0> ok sorry i didnt clarify.
[07:39:34] <sine0> I am not aware of other reasons, but im sure there are more complex reasons other than width and display purposes
[13:37:33] <GeekMonkey> anyone work with the youtube iframe API?
[13:38:10] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[13:38:47] <GeekMonkey> I want to have the api load in on window.load and have the youtube video to be loaded into a div where there is an image placeholder on click
[13:39:06] <robertmaxrees> seems like a non-jquery question to me :)
[13:39:35] <GeekMonkey> true.... but I don't think there is an youtube api channel ;-)
[13:39:52] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change the subject of this channel
[13:41:16] <GeekMonkey> though you would use jquery to lazy load the api
[13:41:23] <robertmaxrees> then whip up your attempt! :)
[13:42:22] <robertmaxrees> though i wouldn't use jquery to do this if you're not already using it.
[13:42:40] <GeekMonkey> it is in a WP site so jquery is already being loaded in
[13:42:55] <robertmaxrees> so then are you going to use jquery to try to solve this problem?
[13:45:05] <GeekMonkey> Yes
[13:45:20] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what have you tried?
[13:45:38] <GeekMonkey> putting my code together right now
[13:54:23] <robertmaxrees> why not just init everything normally, just position the image over the youtube video, then on click just hide the image?
[13:58:20] <GeekMonkey> It seems with the youtube iframe API I will still run into the current issue I am having
[13:58:30] <GeekMonkey> and that is to get the video to autoplay with sound
[13:58:35] <GeekMonkey> after click
[13:58:35] <robertmaxrees> you can't do either.
[13:58:52] <robertmaxrees> autoplay with sound is a sketch proposition in most modern browsers.
[14:00:25] <robertmaxrees> why is the standard youtube thumbnail not good enough for this case?
[14:01:26] <GeekMonkey> I am checking with the Project Manager... not sure why
[14:01:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> you can even customize it.  users are used to it, to boot.
[14:02:59] <GeekMonkey> can you have a custom preview image based on a url
[14:03:15] <robertmaxrees> nope.  but changing the thumbnail per url seems odd.
[14:08:34] <GeekMonkey> instead of the basic image that YT provides the client wants more of a customized image
[14:09:00] <GeekMonkey> without all the controls showing
[14:09:04] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:09:15] <robertmaxrees> you can do custom thumbnails
[14:09:46] <robertmaxrees> https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72431?hl=en
[14:12:40] <GeekMonkey> Ya that would be too much to change on clients videos
[14:12:45] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:12:56] <robertmaxrees> okay well you can't "autoplay with sound" in all browsers soooo
[14:13:08] <robertmaxrees> *all browsers for all users
[14:13:17] <GeekMonkey> exactly
[14:13:29] <robertmaxrees> so what you're asking for is kind of a no-go heh
[14:13:51] <GeekMonkey> but I can improve the UX a bit for mobile
[14:14:06] <robertmaxrees> by making the user click an extra time?
[14:17:32] <GeekMonkey> currently I have a custom preview on desktop... when the use clicks it replaces the preview image with the iframe and plays the video muted
[14:17:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:17:57] <robertmaxrees> autoplaying videos with sound is blocked by quite a few browsers with some specific exceptions.
[14:18:01] <GeekMonkey> for mobile I will remove the preview image and just have it load the iframe ready to be clicked
[16:36:33] <kawhi> how would i select all inputs in a form?
