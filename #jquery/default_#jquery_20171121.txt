[02:57:19] <WhirledPress> Hey all, if I have a class assigned to an element with an animated transition for the "left" property, is the element supposed to automatically animate if I change the left property?
[02:57:34] <WhirledPress> or only if I assign a new class with a different left property?
[05:49:29] <d3m0n> How do I pass the submit button to my AJAX post? In the console you can see just the email and password is being passed. https://codepen.io/jstn/pen/EbEaoM
[07:07:08] <Neo2> I look at this code and can't understand how it work https://www.detectadblock.com/
[07:07:51] <Neo2> who know how determined deleted ads? On that site adblocker is working perfectly
[07:07:59] <Neo2> I want equal
[07:16:57] <FilipNortic_> Neo2: they include a js file called ads.js and use it to create a div with  obsucure id
[07:17:16] <FilipNortic_> then they check if that div was created in the site js
[07:18:47] <Neo2> FilipNortic_: I'm going to put google adsence on my site and force users click and watch ads, How I can check that user is blocking my ads?
[07:19:41] <Neo2> FilipNortic_: do you know prepared working script without ubfiscated code
[07:20:40] <FilipNortic_> beating adblockers is half a sience on it's own so you'll have to keep diging... And might be a hard supject to find open source help for
[07:22:26] <Neo2> FilipNortic_: I've found http://www.antiblock.org/#adblocker
[07:22:42] <Neo2> FilipNortic_: or this, but this is hiden code https://blockadblock.com/configure.php
[07:23:21] <Neo2> FilipNortic_: it's long time take broken down those first code, I need the prepared code,
[07:25:45] <Neo2> those second code doesn't worked in my desktop, I had tested it
[07:25:50] <Neo2> didn't work
[07:26:18] <Neo2> I had tested it, and didn't work
[07:29:31] <Cork> Neo2: those detectos work by adding an element, a resource matching one of the rules adblockers use
[07:30:03] <Cork> Neo2: and then it detects if that resource isn't loaded or if the element has a smaller size then they expect in the page
[07:30:33] <Cork> if it is an adblocker has modified what the script adds, else there is no adblocker (or the size is whitelisted)
[07:31:13] <Cork> Neo2: the response is that adblockers has lists of filters to dedetect the adblocker so :)
[07:32:17] <Neo2> ok, understood
[07:33:50] <dimi1947> before explaining what I am trying to do I want you to tell me what is wrong wuth this code syntactically:https://hastebin.com/ubizoluzel.js
[07:57:09] <FilipNortic_> dimi1947: you shoud use $(this) inside the function
[07:57:35] <FilipNortic_> (".services") which i'm not sure were you got
[07:57:50] <FilipNortic_> not... ^
[09:20:13] <poboy> so I have this-  let tableFormJSON = JSON.parse($('#formJSON').text());   and I'm trying to change the value but this gives me "is not a function" error.  I assume this is a syntax issue?  $(tableFormJSON[0][0][86].val(0));
[09:42:48] <taplar> poboy: you don't need jQuery to change the value of a json object
[09:43:01] <taplar> tableFormJSON[0][0][86] = 0;
[10:06:45] <poboy> haha.  thanks taplar.  I really am dumb sometimes
[10:08:57] <moldy> hi
[10:09:27] <moldy> can i get the response headers of the response to a request fired with jquery.post()?
[10:16:41] <Cork> moldy: $.post().done(function(data, status, xhr) { xhr.getResponseHeader('') }
[10:16:53] <moldy> Cork: thanks
[10:16:53] <Cork> same as you would do with $.ajax
[10:17:03] <moldy> Cork: is this interface documented anywhere?
[10:17:22] <Cork> moldy: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[10:17:32] <Cork> and the rest of that page basically
[10:17:37] <moldy> Cork: ah right, thanks.
[10:17:55] <Cork> moldy: note $.post and $.get is a TINY wrapper around $.ajax
[10:18:03] <moldy> Cork: yeah, thanks
[10:18:19] <moldy> right now i wonder how i get the exact http status code
[10:18:26] <Cork> $.fn.post = function(url, data) { return $.ajax(url. { type: 'post', data: data }); }
[10:18:48] <moldy> ah, .status i guess
[10:18:55] <Cork> moldy: 2xx is .done 4xx and 5xx is fail
[10:19:19] <moldy> Cork: right, but i want to get the *exact* status :)
[10:19:45] <Cork> ya, that would be xhr.status
[10:20:15] <moldy> great, thanks!
[10:20:28] <Cork> moldy: alternatively you can use $.ajax(url, { statusCode: { 225: function() {}, 200: function() {} } });
[10:27:48] <undefined_bob> I have a bunch of divs like this one: <div class="balken"><div class="balkenclosed">our Team</div></div>.   is there a way to read the "our team" part out of multiple divs and then insert an id="our team" behind 'div class="balkenclosed"'?
[10:28:51] <taplar> what do you mean 'behind'?
[10:29:05] <taplar> remember you're talking about the DOM tree
[10:29:05] <taplar> there is no behind
[10:30:51] <undefined_bob> I mean the result should be like this: <div class="balken"><div class="balkenclosed" id="our_team">our Team</div></div>
[10:31:13] <undefined_bob> with behind I meant like after
[10:31:26] <taplar> so you want to put the id on the element that has that text
[10:31:43] <taplar> lol
[10:31:44] <taplar> don't think about it in terms of the markup
[10:31:57] <taplar> <X></X> creates a dom node
[10:32:14] <undefined_bob> the text is variable and change from div to div
[10:32:19] <taplar> that node has properties, it has parents, it has children, and siblings
[10:32:19] <taplar> think about it in that context.
[10:32:41] <undefined_bob> the id should only be used as an anchor
[10:33:12] <taplar> so you want to find those elements, read their text() or innerHTML, depending on jQuery or vanilla access, and then set the id of the element
[10:34:17] <undefined_bob> yes, find that element based on the class, because the class is always the same, read the text() and then write/insert the id to its specified place
[10:34:30] <undefined_bob> I'm not sure if that is even possible
[10:34:53] <taplar> yep
[10:34:58] <undefined_bob> maybe its just a stupid idea but I have to find a way to do something like that
[10:35:28] <taplar> you just described the steps you need to do to do it
[10:35:37] <taplar> find elements, loop over each element, for an element, set it's id = to inner text modified
[10:36:06] <undefined_bob> yes, that are the steps. but is that even possible?
[10:36:25] <undefined_bob> or is it something one would rate complicated?
[10:36:52] <taplar> yes it's possible
[10:36:52] <taplar> why would it not be?
[10:37:58] <undefined_bob> sometimes I have ideas which are too complicated to realize
[10:38:08] <undefined_bob> thats why I asked
[10:38:38] <taplar> and we just said the steps to do to do it
[10:38:44] <undefined_bob> but thank you for your help
[10:38:50] <undefined_bob> yes, its all good
[10:38:51] <taplar> so do them
[10:39:43] <FilipNortic_> well sometimes there are smarter ways, can't see any here though
[10:40:38] <undefined_bob> yes, that was also my intention why I asked. to hear if my idea is totally stupid and if there are better/smarter ones
[10:41:06] <undefined_bob> It wasnt in my mind to ask you to do my work, dont get me wrong
[10:41:35] <taplar> that wasn't very clear.  what i saw was you repeatedly asking if it was possible at all
[10:42:17] <undefined_bob> because I really had no idea if it would be. I'm a beginner with all that stuff
[10:42:29] <taplar> it's like if you asked how to bake a cake, dude gave you a recipe, and then you kept asking if it was possible
[10:42:44] <undefined_bob> and then I have a theoretical idea and have no idea if my idea is practical
[10:43:12] <taplar> heh, practicality is another issue
[10:43:24] <undefined_bob> yes, because the recipe could be full of irony which I dont see
[10:43:30] <taplar> i'm just gonna tell you how to do things, usually
[10:43:51] <taplar> wut?
[10:45:24] <undefined_bob> its all good
[10:45:41] <undefined_bob> work is over for today, heading home now. thank you very much for your help again :)
[10:46:05] <taplar> lucky dog.  my day just started
[12:18:33] <taplar> so many broken unit tests ...
[13:06:34] <poboy> So this gives me info $(this).closest('tr');    but this is undefined?  $(this).closest('tr').attr('id');
[13:07:23] <taplar> tr doesn't have to have an id
[13:07:29] <robertmaxrees> \^
[13:07:53] <taplar> or closest() is returning 0 elements
[13:08:18] <robertmaxrees> or you're getting multiple TRs, but the first one doesn't have an ID.
[13:08:50] <poboy> well shit
[13:09:31] <poboy> when I inspect, dev tools says tr id="5"
[13:10:06] <robertmaxrees> what is $(this).closest('tr').length ?
[13:10:51] <poboy> damn, 0
[13:11:03] <robertmaxrees> so then your $(this) isn't what you think it is.
[13:11:08] <robertmaxrees> likely.
[13:11:16] <robertmaxrees> is it a child element?
[13:12:18] <poboy> console.log($(this)); says Window
[13:12:27] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:12:29] <robertmaxrees> sooo.
[13:12:43] <robertmaxrees> you're not using a fat arrow, are you?
[13:13:06] <taplar> phss, californians ....
[13:13:14] <poboy> =>  ?    no
[13:13:18] <taplar> ;)
[13:13:24] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:13:30] <robertmaxrees> poboy mind showing your code then?
[13:13:58] <poboy> it's convoluted but sure
[13:14:09] <robertmaxrees> just the specific bit you're dealing with is fine.
[13:16:53] <poboy> https://kopy.io/8v5w8
[13:17:15] <robertmaxrees> erm/.
[13:17:21] <robertmaxrees> could ytopu show the actual rendered output?
[13:17:22] <taplar> inline binding
[13:17:23] <poboy> tr id is set
[13:17:45] <taplar> line 33
[13:17:46] <robertmaxrees> ah - don't do inline binding.
[13:18:02] <robertmaxrees> taplar++
[13:18:07] <poboy> yeah unfortunately that's how they like this stuff done
[13:18:13] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:18:19] <robertmaxrees> it's also going to cause bugs and issues.
[13:20:18] <taplar> such as in this case were you don't have reference to an event and the 'this' is not bound to the element that invoked the method
[13:20:27] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:20:47] <taplar> "they like" is less important in the face of "it doesn't work", :)
[13:20:52] <poboy> so if I have an event listener then $this will have what I need?
[13:21:51] <taplar> if you bind an event handler to the element(s) logically, the 'this' will be the element that is handling the event
[13:22:20] <taplar> optionally, iirc, you could also throw 'this' in that inline binding, but that's uggo
[13:25:39] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/z018x0j6/  yh
[13:25:39] <taplar> *yah
[13:51:22] <ilyaigpetrov> Hi. What does this mean: `$("<div>", { "id": "disqus_thread" });`
[13:51:36] <robertmaxrees> ilyaigpetrov it creates a div with that ID.
[13:51:42] <ilyaigpetrov> thanks, easy
[13:51:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd generally avoid doing it that way buuuuut yeah.
[13:52:14] <grapheti> Go with your gut!
[13:52:19] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:52:48] <ilyaigpetrov> he rephrased listen to your heart
[13:53:05] <grapheti> ilyaigpetrov: I was joking :P
[14:28:16] <t532> if i updated.a poperty on callback onCreate or onUpdate would it have immediate effect?https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html#onCreate
[14:29:44] <robertmaxrees> t532 sounds like an xy problem.  what are you actually trying to accomplish
[14:29:45] <robertmaxrees> "?
[14:30:57] <t532> if the popup is displayed at the top then arrow needs to appear at the bottom https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html#modifiers..arrow
[14:32:22] <t532> is is fine, it the y co-ordinate
[14:33:57] <t532> it appears to be fixed at the top, which makes sense because i have the positioned it using css, to make the arrow aligned with the hovered text, when popup is displayed at the bottom
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> so you want to change the position of the tooltip and have the arrow work correctly?
[14:35:26] <robertmaxrees> you realize there's a placements option, right?
[14:35:48] <t532> well, if the popup is displayed at the bottom it apears to be ok
[14:36:01] <t532> only when the popup is displayed at the top
[14:36:05] <t532> what do you mean?
[14:36:11] <t532> placement option?
[14:38:16] <robertmaxrees> https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html#Popper.placements
[14:39:32] <t532> right!
[14:39:44] <robertmaxrees> so why not just use that?
[14:39:50] <diverdude> I am loading a site and I am trying to understand what javascript code is running when i load the page. How can i find out?
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> diverdude your developer tools.
[14:40:02] <t532> thats for the initial position, which is set at the bottom
[14:40:12] <robertmaxrees> can run the profiler and look at it from there.
[14:41:00] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: you mean in chrome?
[14:41:14] <t532> placements, is used to tell the lib the default position, so if i set the position to bottom, then if there is enoguh space at the bottom it will display it at the bottom.
[14:41:24] <robertmaxrees> diverdude they all have a profiler, but yeah.
[14:41:38] <robertmaxrees> at least, that'll show you performance issues, which I assume is what you're tackling.
[14:41:56] <robertmaxrees> t532 right... so why is that not what you need?
[14:42:30] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: "performance"
[14:42:45] <t532> i'm using it. the lib automatically moves the popup to the top when i scroll down
[14:43:04] <robertmaxrees> diverdude so when let's reframe the question - why are you looking for scrips that run on pageload?
[14:43:41] <robertmaxrees> *then
[14:44:48] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: because on pageload there is a certain box which is set shown and other boxes as hidden, and i need to check in selenium which box is shown....but before i can do this i need to understand how and when it is set as shown
[14:45:18] <taplar> that seems weird
[14:45:19] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  our QA guys never really get into that with selenium.  hrmmm.
[14:45:21] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:45:43] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[14:45:50] <taplar> Doesn't the story detail that information?
[14:46:02] <taplar> "When the user goes to the page, X happens"
[14:46:14] <taplar> "When the user is on the page and does X, Y happens."
[14:46:15] <taplar> ?
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:46:29] <robertmaxrees> diverdude not really sure why you need to know the implementation details behind something for selenium.
[14:46:35] <taplar> Knowing how the script does it isn't really important to the user.  Just that it happens
[14:46:44] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: when you load this page: https://www.bolius.dk/radonfrithjem/vaelg-partner/?q=4&cHash=3708442503307d42ba08d11fd1a491ee     you see that one box is visible. I need to check that its the correct one
[14:47:08] <taplar> one box?
[14:47:22] <robertmaxrees> i think he means that particular "step"
[14:47:37] <robertmaxrees> you mean the one with the ID c389740 ?
[14:48:54] <taplar> selenium, iirc, should have a visibility check as part of it
[14:48:59] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:50:11] <diverdude> taplar: ?
[14:50:28] <taplar> You'd just look up the element that should be visible, and check that
[14:51:17] <diverdude> taplar: but the thing is that when i load the page with selenium they are all visible so to say
[14:51:33] <diverdude> taplar: some javascript code is running which displays only one box in the slider
[14:51:52] <robertmaxrees> diverdude there are "waits" available.
[14:51:57] <taplar> sounds like a possible configuration issue
[14:52:01] <taplar> ^
[14:52:11] <robertmaxrees> you can also bind to js events iirc.
[14:52:21] <robertmaxrees> could wait until window load or document.ready.
[14:52:23] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: i tried using : driver.set_page_load_timeout(10) but that did not work
[14:52:48] <taplar> now we're kinda getting into the selenium weeds, which is kinda OT
[14:53:09] <diverdude> taplar: right...but is there anywhere else to discuss that?
[14:53:25] <robertmaxrees> #selenium
[14:53:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:53:30] <robertmaxrees> it's a real place.
[14:53:46] <grapheti> Is it magical?
[14:53:57] <taplar> depends on how country you are
[14:54:05] <grapheti> LOL
[14:55:17] <taplar> and i grew up in a city with one flashing intersection light.  so i can say that, :P
[14:56:32] <grapheti> EXPERIENCE VALIDATED!
[14:56:43] <taplar> heh
[14:57:03] <poboy> really surprised I haven't been fired yet
[14:57:22] <Neo1> taplar: hi
[14:57:28] <taplar> bonjour
[14:57:47] <Neo1> taplar: go to my site, what do you see there say http://kselax.ru/
[14:58:00] <taplar> huh?
[14:58:23] <Neo1> taplar: I've made something interesting, you should check it. Say when you check
[14:58:30] <taplar> lol, what's it about?
[14:58:44] <Neo1> taplar: go and you notice yourself
[14:58:47] <grapheti> I see a long page load time and a timeout.
[14:58:52] <taplar> nah
[14:58:56] <grapheti> 5 stars!
[14:59:08] <Neo1> grapheti: and do you use addblocker?
[14:59:18] <grapheti> That I do.
[14:59:19] <Neo1> grapheti: what the timeout?
[14:59:32] <Neo1> grapheti: and did you see message that say you off it?
[14:59:49] <taplar> not in this browser currently.  but i'm also not in a habit of going to websites people try to get me to go to without an explaniation of what i'm going there for
[14:59:59] <taplar> and i saw some of your ads convo from yesterday, :P
[15:00:12] <grapheti> it says something like Venus For Men new fun toy.
[15:00:17] <grapheti> Experience it now.
[15:00:31] <Neo1> taplar: good, now everybody will see my adds :p
[15:00:54] <taplar> so.... do you have a jQuery question about it, or are you spaming?
[15:01:33] <grapheti> He did it for the views.
[15:01:34] <Neo1> grapheti: do you see this message http://prntscr.com/hdgx9v?
[15:01:45] <taplar> figured
[15:02:04] <taplar> whatever happened to doing the wordpress templates thing?
[15:02:07] <grapheti> Neo1: http://recordit.co/aDkSzPCblo
[15:02:09] <taplar> or the making a chat room thing?
[15:02:50] <Neo1> taplar: I'm going to do chat room on days
[15:03:21] <grapheti> Make it sexy.
[15:03:22] <grapheti> Sex sells.
[15:03:50] <Neo1> grapheti: why? Where are you from? That server placed in Moscow. Seems you live far
[15:03:52] <taplar> pretty sure snapchat already exists
[15:04:02] <grapheti> lol
[15:04:18] <grapheti> I live in Oklahoma, US.
[15:04:24] <grapheti> So, yeah, I'd say so.
[15:04:45] <grapheti> I got to take care of these Indians, just a sec.
[15:04:56] <grapheti> Alright, continue.
[15:05:15] <Neo1> grapheti: throw ocean cable is bed pass data, not surprising you couldn't load it
[15:06:09] <grapheti> dam tube got clogged
[15:06:43] <Neo1> taplar: do you know node.js? I'm learning it now
[15:07:06] <taplar> not very much
[15:08:02] <duch_kazatel> Neo1 there's an entire channel dedicated to that subject if you need help.
[15:08:08] <Neo1> taplar: and socket.io? I don't understand why there use angular.js  Was in video there guy use naked javascript, but this for education aims maybe
[15:08:21] <grapheti> #node.js
[15:08:36] <taplar> i've done some socket, sure
[15:08:37] <Neo1> duch_kazatel: I know, I often hangout there, I'm going to go there now
[15:09:23] <taplar> node js, iirc, was one of the first things to use websockets
[15:10:20] <taplar> it's supported in more languages now though, but it may be that most people are still familiar to using it in node
[15:11:16] <Neo1> taplar: socket.io seems easy, it's easy put to php site, I understood how to do it watching video
[15:13:49] <grapheti> I like playing with toy dolls.
[15:14:16] <taplar> that's nice
[15:16:44] <Neo1> see this, it's my future chat :) http://american-chat.kselax.ru/ I've prepared place
[15:17:34] <grapheti> I wish my internet connection cared.
[15:27:15] <taplar> my roommate has today until next monday off.  so jelly
[15:27:43] <grapheti> I'm off Thursday and don't come back till Tuesday. :D
[15:28:54] <t532> Before you hover over the text, make sure you scroll down so the text is at the top when hover over it. You'll see the box appear at the bottom, notice how the arrow is (correctly) pointed at the text? Now scroll up, when the text is at bottom, hover over the text again, you'll see it appear at the top, notice how the arrow is at the top? it should appear at the bottom of the popup and pointing towards the text. - https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/ojb8pwrz/6

[15:29:49] <t532> i tried following the doc but i can't get it to work, here is the relavent section - https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html#modifiers..arrow
[15:37:02] <duch_kazatel> coupla questions - why are you adding/removing the markup in a handler?
[16:02:17] <Technodrome> any jquery plugins to expand a div ? like say its so big, then click a button and it fully expands?
[19:38:35] <Cache_Money> I'm trying to add text to a form's input field using jQuery. Is it possible to do this? I'm having no luck after successfully selecing the input field. There are no methods on that variable that allow me to do so. I've tried doing `zipcodeInput.setAttribute("value", "98101");` but even if I change the `value` attribute I get an error if the input doesn't actually have any text in it
[20:04:57] <shoky_> Cache_Money:  with jquery you'd use $(...).val("98101")
[20:05:24] <shoky_> without jquery you'd use:  input.value = "98101"
[20:06:49] <Cache_Money> shoky_: .val() isn't available on that element (stored in a variable). I had to use `setAttribute()` in order to change the `value` attribute of the input. However, setting the value attr isn't enough for me to successfully submit the form. I think it must have something to do with the fact that they are using React because I see `data-reactid` attributes on all of the form elements
[20:22:35] <shoky_> Cache_Money: only the .value property matters for <input>s,  not the "value" attribute
[20:24:00] <shoky_> Cache_Money: and you can always wrap an element in ajquery object if you want..  $(element).val(...0
[20:24:07] <shoky_> $(element).val(...)
[20:25:06] <shoky_> Cache_Money but if it's in a react component then you probably don't want to touch the DOM yourself. that's what react is for :p
[21:45:15] <buzzluigiyear> What's the best way to check when an input text tag triggers focus / gets unfocused?
[21:45:25] <buzzluigiyear> I tried .focusin() and .focusout() but nothing happens
[22:01:03] <konrados> Hi, I know this is OT, but I'll try anyway, I'm a bit tired of this... I want to add an 'on play' event to mediaelement.js *after* is is created... I can do this: $('.myClass).bind('playing', function(e)... but in this way I have access to the original html code (<video...) not the one made by mediaelement...
[22:01:14] <konrados> I'm getting crazy with this
