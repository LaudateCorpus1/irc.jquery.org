[00:33:24] <coRz> Good morning
[02:04:35] <raj> instead of callbacks, how about triggering events?
[02:04:40] <raj> is this a thing?
[02:06:39] <coRz> did you people hear paul walker has died (fast and furious)
[02:06:53] <coRz> was a good actor :(
[02:07:26] <raj> yep, in a flaming car
[02:07:30] <raj> wonder if it was on set
[02:07:44] <coRz> nope he was on his way to a charity event i think
[02:07:51] <coRz> his friend was driving
[02:08:00] <raj> fast and furiously?
[02:08:12] <coRz> i guess
[02:08:24] <coRz> only 40 years old..
[02:08:35] <raj> smh
[02:08:44] <raj> I especially hate when passengers die
[02:09:42] <coRz> well maybe it was supposed to be.. never know
[02:10:26] <djangonoob> can someone tell me when to use bind(click), on(click), click()
[02:10:35] <raj> djangonoob, use .on('click')
[02:10:45] <djangonoob> what is the difference?
[02:10:53] <raj> the others are older
[02:10:59] <djangonoob> k, thx
[02:11:08] <raj> there's also .live(), which falls somewhere in that category
[02:12:12] <djangonoob> yes, I forgot this
[02:12:21] <djangonoob> is live() also old?
[02:16:52] <coRz> theres .delegate() too..
[02:17:28] <coRz> click  and bind are directly cast on the the requested element
[02:18:04] <coRz> .live and delegate both listen to event bubble
[02:22:28] <raj> djangonoob, just use .on(), it does the right thing
[02:22:31] <raj> including delegating
[02:22:46] <raj> you only need to know the others to understand older code
[02:23:15] <djangonoob> I have a checkbox slider this: http://jsfiddle.net/4DXL5/, if I click an ajax request is created, but why not if I "slide" ?
[02:24:30] <coRz> mousedown?
[02:24:36] <coRz> thats a click for you..
[02:24:47] <djangonoob> no
[02:25:17] <djangonoob> the .on(change) listen for the click
[02:26:02] <djangonoob> or did I misunderstand you?
[02:26:13] <coRz> djangonoob, trigger the change event from on("mousemove");
[02:26:38] <coRz> $(".onoffswitch-checkbox").trigger("change");
[02:27:27] <djangonoob> ah, I thought that I have to do nothing if I have a .on(change) listener
[02:27:50] <djangonoob> and I change the checkbox on(move)
[02:30:00] <coRz> djangonoob, you're funny
[02:30:16] <coRz> djangonoob, your checkbox doesnt have on change evvent
[02:30:17] <djangonoob> funny? mby a noob
[02:31:24] <djangonoob> but why was it working with checkbox.on("change") if I click the checkbox?
[02:31:33] <coRz> sec ill post a solution
[02:33:52] <djangonoob> anyway, I tried .trigger("change"). now if I keep on holding mouse down and slide, not only one request gets created
[02:35:54] <coRz> http://jsfiddle.net/4DXL5/1/
[02:37:17] <djangonoob> other question, when to use <input type="checkbox" checked> and when checked="checked", or is checked="checked" the new/old way?
[02:37:30] <coRz> sametthing
[02:37:43] <coRz> use checked
[02:38:19] <coRz> less messy (check="checked").. than just checked
[02:39:00] <djangonoob> ok
[02:39:27] <coRz> djangonoob, code worked for you?
[02:40:21] <djangonoob> you mean .trigger("change") ?
[02:41:26] <djangonoob> coRz, sry, didn't see your jsfiddle. checking...
[02:45:18] <djangonoob> coRz, it is workin. thx a lot
[02:45:35] <coRz> djangonoob, np ;)
[02:49:08] <xorcist> hi all :)
[03:04:21] <coRz> hey xorcist
[03:04:47] <xorcist> yop :)
[03:10:52] <jost> can I catch copy-events (as in "copy to the clipboard") and modify the copied text? I'd like to remove the soft hyphens from the pasted code.
[03:11:29] <jost> *from the copied text, sorry
[03:14:03] <deed02392> hey can someone recommend an appropriate input type for a 'whitelist' type interface, where a user adds a name it it's appended to a list which is then dynamically removable etc?
[03:37:20] <_rgn> deed02392: select tag with multiple attr maybe
[03:38:16] <deed02392> _rgn, is there a jquery-ui solution for this kind of thing?
[03:38:23] <deed02392> seems to me like something that would have been done many times
[03:39:39] <_rgn> i have no idea
[03:41:06] <coRz> whats the problem?
[04:11:22] <xorcist> is there someone here who know jquery datatables plugin ?
[04:11:25] <xorcist> is there someone here who know jquery datatables plugin ?
[04:11:38] <xorcist> i'm having an issue using tabs

[04:14:09] <xorcist> someone who could help plz ? guys
[04:17:53] <Alina-malina> how can i see what function is triggering when i click a button with console webdevtools?
[04:19:45] <xorcist> Alina-malina: console.log("a message here")
[04:19:53] <Alina-malina> no it is not that
[04:20:06] <Alina-malina> i click a button i want to see what functions are executed?
[04:20:22] <xorcist> ah
[04:20:38] <xorcist> well, i cannot help in that context sorry
[04:29:49] <coRz> Alina-malina, you need to use callee
[04:29:56] <Alina-malina> what is calle?
[04:30:31] <coRz> you can see what function was called and who called it
[04:30:49] <coRz> like this: arguments.callee.caller.toString()
[04:31:06] <coRz> from the function its self
[04:32:05] <Alina-malina> i dont understand
[04:32:17] <Alina-malina> i click a button i want to see what javascript is executed
[04:32:17] <coRz> and in firefox you have a plugin called javascript deobfuscator you can see live what function are executing
[04:33:24] <coRz> http://i.stack.imgur.com/XVWzI.png
[04:34:08] <coRz> you can breakpoint any event/function
[04:34:26] <Alina-malina> ok let me try it
[04:34:38] <Alina-malina> just a moment my browser freezes when i launch deobfuscator
[04:34:48] <Alina-malina> and crashed lool
[04:34:53] <coRz> lol
[04:35:03] <coRz> update the client
[04:36:40] <Alina-malina> i dont understand this deobfuscator
[04:36:47] <Alina-malina> it brings jquery only, i dont need that
[04:37:01] <coRz> Alina-malina, you need to specify the files you want to log
[04:37:02] <coRz> :/
[04:37:02] <Alina-malina> i dont want to show it the jquerymin
[04:37:07] <Alina-malina> oh how?
[04:37:40] <coRz> modify filters
[04:38:03] <Alina-malina> <script src="/js/script.js?"></script> i want to trace only this one, how i should apply filter?
[04:38:04] <coRz> and add the javascript folder : http://localhost/Scripts/em/
[04:38:06] <Alina-malina> can you give me example?
[04:38:18] <Alina-malina> only ur?
[04:38:20] <Alina-malina> url?
[04:38:27] <coRz> yeah
[04:40:36] <Alina-malina> coRz, ok i setup this, but how i can find my click in logs?
[04:42:00] <coRz> just scroll downin the executed scripts and press on the button youll see the last function called.. thats it
[04:42:22] <Alina-malina> if it is empty all and i click it should be the first? one right?
[04:43:49] <coRz> yeah, if you click and more than one function were called its prolly from the same event several functions were called but the first one is the actual click
[04:44:21] <Alina-malina> yes definitely i fugure that ony, the first one it says function (event,ui{code here}
[04:44:31] <Alina-malina> it means that it was my click right?
[04:44:35] <coRz> yeah
[04:44:46] <Alina-malina> coRz, ok, it makes alot easier things, thank you!
[04:44:56] <coRz> np :)
[04:44:59] <Alina-malina> coRz, what is compiled scrpts and executed scripts? what is the difference?
[04:45:31] <xorcist> coRz: is there something similar to deobfuscator for chrome ??
[04:45:33] <coRz> compiled scripts youll see all scripts that were loaded
[04:46:06] <Alina-malina> coRz, you mean already executed?
[04:46:12] <coRz> xorcist, i did try to find something for chrome.. i found something similar but not the same: called VisualEvent
[04:46:34] <Alina-malina> coRz, thank you so much for this tool, it will make my life alot easier, just need to bear with stuff
[04:46:38] <coRz> its a bookmark you add and it runs js code that shows you all the events and binds and the function that will be called
[04:46:38] <Alina-malina> thanks alot!
[04:47:01] <coRz> Alina, np happy to help
[04:47:29] <Alina-malina> coRz, are you online all the time? or just today?
[04:47:36] <coRz> always
[04:47:53] <Alina-malina> coRz, i may have more questions later, i would like to ask later
[04:50:16] <coRz> xorcist: add this to your bookmark on chrome:
[04:50:20] <coRz> javascript:(function() {var protocol = window.location.protocol === 'file:' ?'http:' : '';var url = protocol+'//www.sprymedia.co.uk/VisualEvent/VisualEvent_Loader.js';if( typeof VisualEvent!='undefined' ) {if ( VisualEvent.instance !== null ) {VisualEvent.close();}else {new VisualEvent();}}else {var n=document.createElement('script');n.setAttribute('language','JavaScript');n.setAttribute('src
[04:50:20] <coRz> ',url+'?rand='+new Date().getTime());document.body.appendChild(n);}})();
[04:50:22] <xorcist> coRz: in the screenshot you provided you were using chrome with deobfuscator or am i  wrong ?
[04:51:30] <xorcist> i did not install visualEvent, gonna try deobfuscator first i think
[04:51:31] <coRz> xorcist, just add the code i posted to your bookmarks as url then click on it while on your site
[04:51:41] <coRz> deob is for firefox
[04:52:06] <xorcist> i have both , chrome and firefox, gonna try firefox but i dont see it in the console
[04:53:23] <coRz> xorcist, Firefox tooltab - > webdeveloper -> deob
[04:55:27] <xorcist> got it thx :)
[04:55:44] <coRz> np
[05:11:44] <jop008> In my onchange routine I am fiddling with selected index which can create strange effects how to avoid this?
[05:12:10] <jop008> So I want to change selectedindex of other select boxes
[05:12:22] <jop008> without triggering onchange
[05:33:28] <numero_youknow> Why do some people write "$(function($)" at the beginning of their jquery code? Do we really need 2 $'s there?
[07:06:07] <joroci> did anyone import google/gmail contacts?
[07:07:39] <hfp> Hey guys, I am trying ot get a modal dialog on my webpage. From what I understand, I need a special css class for the modal background so I went to the theme roller. However, I am confused... Why does the theme roller's page asks for which components of the jQuery-UI API I want to download? I am using the Google hosted library on my page and I would only like the images and css relating to the theme. Is it safe to ignore the js part an
[07:07:39] <hfp> move the themes directory to my css directory?
[07:30:23] <Pedro> hello guys
[07:30:45] <Pedro> can someone help me with :last selector with dynamic content?
[07:34:40] <Velveeta> pedro: what's the problem with it?
[07:38:04] <Pedro> Velveeta, well Im trying to make a infinite scroll, so the plugin grab new content from a pag
[07:38:06] <Pedro> page*
[07:38:13] <Velveeta> ok
[07:38:30] <Pedro> but when I use $('#perolas:last').data('id')
[07:38:35] <Pedro> it always return the first
[07:38:37] <Pedro> not the last
[07:38:48] <coRz> lol
[07:38:55] <coRz> Pedro
[07:39:01] <coRz> Pedro, you try to select id
[07:39:10] <coRz> it will always return you the first one
[07:39:14] <coRz> use class instaed
[07:39:16] <Pedro> it it return the first #Perolas
[07:39:20] <Pedro> ahh, really?
[07:39:25] <coRz> because its an id....
[07:39:29] <coRz> unique...
[07:39:32] <Pedro> so, id is unique
[07:39:34] <Pedro> wtf dude
[07:39:39] <coRz> yeah basic html
[07:39:55] <Pedro> didnt got that haha
[07:39:58] <coRz> lol
[07:40:07] <Pedro> let me see
[07:40:10] <coRz> use class instead
[07:40:16] <Pedro> im not a front-end expert
[07:40:21] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone knows a solution to redirect to another web if the user have a mobile?
[07:40:23] <Pedro> i work on back-end :<
[07:40:27] <coRz> well thats why you are here
[07:40:32] <coRz> i work on backend too..
[07:41:21] <coRz> abailarri, sure navigator.useragent
[07:41:48] <Pedro> but coRz, the dynamic html will "bind" with the selector too?
[07:42:06] <coRz> Pedro, explain
[07:42:10] <coRz> didnt understand the question
[07:42:26] <Pedro> let me see if it will work or not
[07:42:27] <Pedro> one second
[07:42:50] <Velveeta> pedro: what corz said, id's are expected to be unique in the document, so it stops searching for them after it encounters the first one… if you use a class name, then yes, your selector will be searched against all of those classes and return just the last one
[07:43:02] <Velveeta> i think that's what you're asking when you ask if the dynamic html will bind w/ the selector
[07:43:08] <RonWhoCares> I am wondering if a jQuery plugin is available which provides similar functionality as <select> but allows each <option> to be displayed containing columns.  I am wanting to use this approach with a ticket system to select the tickets.  I would like to be able to display things like the ticket #, date created, who created the ticket, etc. in columns
[07:44:25] <Velveeta> ronwhocares: i'm sure there are probably select widgets out there that allow you to supply a template for each option in the list, which you could use some sized divs or something for to create the appearance of columns
[07:46:41] <Pedro> well, thank you guys, worked well here
[07:52:28] <Pedro> coRz, well, theres another problem
[07:52:44] <Pedro> the plugin keeps loading the same content
[07:53:43] <Velveeta> pedro: are you storing that last id into a variable somewhere that's maybe caching that value for future lookups?
[07:54:44] <Pedro> I guess, when I created the instance, it keep reading from that
[07:54:52] <Pedro> I want change the offset every request
[07:54:52] <Velveeta> like are you doing something like this? var foo = $('#perolas:last').data('id'); $('#someElement').scroll(function () { /* if at the bottom */ $('#container').load('someUrl?id=' + foo); });
[07:55:08] <Pedro> let me paste it for you
[07:55:12] <Velveeta> there ya go
[07:55:47] <Pedro> http://pastebin.com/5pwf5DQD
[07:56:04] <Velveeta> yeah, that's exactly what's going on
[07:56:16] <Pedro> how can I change it?
[07:57:16] <Velveeta> it looks like your contentData property needs to be changed, but i'm not sure what formats that plugin takes or when it evaluates them, can you link me to where you got that plugin from?
[07:57:35] <Pedro> http://andersonferminiano.com/jqueryscrollpagination/
[07:59:58] <Pedro> Velveeta, I guess im going to do it without plugin
[08:00:07] <Velveeta> nope, i think i found your answer
[08:00:25] <Pedro> Velveeta, how I can change it?
[08:00:29] <Velveeta> one minute
[08:00:33] <Pedro> o
[08:00:34] <Pedro> ok
[08:03:33] <Velveeta> ok, so a) this plugin is written piss-poorly, but there does seem to be a way to update what you're wanting to update
[08:03:48] <Velveeta> in your beforeLoad function that you're passing in as an option
[08:04:17] <Velveeta> add this line: $.fn.scrollPagination.defaults.contentData.offset = $('.perola-box:last').data('id');
[08:05:13] <Velveeta> you can remove your own var offset from that function, and the console.log
[08:05:28] <Pedro> yea
[08:05:34] <Pedro> worked well now
[08:05:51] <Pedro> didnt now I can interate with the properties on this way
[08:05:55] <Pedro> know*
[08:06:15] <Velveeta> well, you *shouldn't* be able to :)
[08:06:36] <Velveeta> if it was written properly, it would have stored those options in the element's data cache, and given you a public method to use to alter them
[08:06:45] <Pedro> ahh sure
[08:06:52] <Pedro> but its a tiny plugin
[08:06:52] <Velveeta> or allowed for contentData to be a function to evaluate that option at load time
[08:07:20] <Pedro> anyway, thank you
[08:07:21] <Pedro> worked well now
[08:08:36] <Velveeta> no problem, good to hear :)
[08:09:44] <Velveeta> as a back end dev, you should be familiar w/ certain concepts like encapsulation, public interfaces, and SRP.. the same kinds of considerations should come into play on the front end also
[08:10:25] <Mrgoose> srp?
[08:10:47] <Velveeta> single responsibility principle
[08:11:17] <Velveeta> each class should focus on a single responsibility, and expose a public interface to utilize it, without regard for how it handles its internal implementation
[08:11:28] <coRz> Velveeta, go easy on him
[08:11:37] <coRz> ;)
[08:12:09] <Velveeta> i'm not railing against him at all
[08:12:55] <Velveeta> i was saying that plugin should have been written in such a way that it exposed functionality to allow for option chancing or evaluation, without having to hack a solution that depended on the way it was written internally
[08:15:10] <coRz> Velveeta,  yeah well theres loads of poorly written plugins out there..
[08:16:19] <Velveeta> oh i know, that's one reason i sit in here, to try to impart a) general knowledge, and b) the philosophy that the front end is more than just a place to stringy spaghetti code together
[08:16:47] <Velveeta> that's why i said front end code should have the same kinds of concepts taken into account that back end code does, with regard to design patterns and principles
[08:17:46] <grafi> Velveeta cheese crusader
[08:17:47] <grafi> :p
[08:19:09] <Velveeta> das right ;) it's literally part of my job description :D
[08:19:16] <grafi> cheese?
[08:19:17] <grafi> ^^
[08:19:22] <grafi> or the crusading part
[08:19:23] <grafi> :P
[08:21:01] <Velveeta> the crusading part :D
[08:21:30] <grafi> that sounds bloody
[08:21:31] <grafi> :P
[08:26:26] <Velveeta> wth, my scrollback seems to have reset its buffer
[08:32:18] <cameron262> i have bootstrap tabs set up
[08:32:25] <cameron262> but i also have subheadings in all the tabs
[08:32:39] <cameron262> with ids in each of them
[08:32:42] <cameron262> which are repeated
[08:32:51] <cameron262> like #morning, #afternoon in each tab
[08:32:54] <grafi> i have pizza
[08:33:23] <cameron262> when i go to page.html#morning
[08:33:28] <cameron262> it only works when im in the first tab
[08:33:33] <cameron262> how can i make it work in every one
[08:35:33] <vinky> cameron262, id's are supposed to be unique
[08:49:42] <ravigehlot> I am trying to extract text from a <td> element that does not have a class or id. It is, indeed, wrapped around a tr that has a class in it. How do I extract the string from <td>?
[08:51:18] <shoky> ravigehlot: what uniquely identifies this <td>?  that is.. how do you know you want THIS td and not another
[08:51:42] <jop008> for jquery mobile is there a grid available where we have sticky headers in a table iwth sort filter options?
[08:52:12] <ravigehlot> shoky: We want to loop (each()) all <td>'s
[08:52:37] <ravigehlot> shoky: all <td>'s whitin class roster
[08:52:37] <shoky> ravigehlot: $('tr.someClass > td').each(...)
[08:56:24] <ravigehlot> shoky: http://paste.laravel.com/1bkf
[08:56:38] <ravigehlot> shoky: it returns an object...now how do I echo the string
[08:56:47] <joroci> ravie
[08:56:54] <joroci> $(this).text()
[08:57:04] <shoky> ravigehlot ^
[08:57:14] <joroci> instead of $('table.roster > td').text()
[08:57:35] <shoky> though either one should get you a string, not an object..
[08:57:44] <joroci> or even better
[08:57:54] <joroci> this.textContent
[08:57:55] <jop008> http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/mobile/html/customdetails.html will jquery mobile come with this functionality http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/mobile/html/customdetails.html?
[08:58:26] <joroci> either the train is on fire or someone is smoking
[08:58:45] <ravigehlot> shoky: it returns an object
[08:59:05] <shoky> ravigehlot: jquery's .text() returns a string
[08:59:20] <shoky> make a jsfiddle demo if you're having trouble with it
[08:59:30] <ravigehlot> shoky: Got it!
[08:59:34] <ravigehlot> shoky: Let me show you the code
[08:59:46] <shoky> ravigehlot uhh btw your paste is wrong.. lines 1-2
[09:00:02] <shoky> and 8
[09:00:50] <shoky> ravigehlot: also  your selector is wrong
[09:00:57] <shoky> ravigehlot:  not table.roster > td
[09:01:01] <shoky> you said the tr had the class..
[09:01:18] <shoky> table.roster > td   will look for <td>'s that are direct children of the table
[09:01:19] <ravigehlot> shoky: http://paste.laravel.com/1bkm
[09:01:41] <shoky> ravigehlot: ok look at the other stuff i said.
[09:01:53] <ravigehlot> shoky: I am trying that code out from Firefox Firedebug tool. That's why I use jQuery(document)
[09:02:06] <shoky> and - if you're still having problms, make a jsfiddle demo
[09:02:06] <ravigehlot> shoky: gotcha
[09:02:14] <ravigehlot> shoky: good point.
[09:02:21] <shoky> ravigehlot: no. it needs to be jQuery(document).ready(function() { .... })
[09:02:27] <shoky> not .ready()  { .. }
[09:03:17] <ravigehlot> shoky: you are right
[09:05:12] <ravigehlot> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/jG6fp/
[09:06:28] <xorcist> does anyone have any experience with jquery datatables plz ? i'm having issues with it
[09:06:32] <shoky> ravigehlot: ok, what's the problem?
[09:07:03] <ravigehlot> shoky: There are 3 <td>'s, we want to extract text for only the first <td> of all <tr>'s
[09:07:50] <shoky> ravigehlot:  $('table.roster tr > td:first-child')
[09:08:16] <ravigehlot> shoky: that's great
[09:08:44] <ravigehlot> shoky: does jsfiddle ever delete their own links?
[09:08:50] <ravigehlot> shoky: i would like to bookmark it
[09:09:49] <shoky> ravigehlot: i haven't encountered any deletions. fiddle bookmarks from ~2 years ago still work
[09:10:49] <ravigehlot> shoky: cool. now...with that output...if I want to populate it into a JSON object. how would I do it?
[09:11:31] <shoky> think you mean a JS array..?
[09:11:53] <ravigehlot> shoky: Well..we can do an array also. I would like to have it serialized....in JSON format.
[09:12:28] <shoky> JSON.stringify(...)  will do that
[09:13:06] <shoky> ravigehlot: http://jsfiddle.net/jG6fp/3/
[09:13:21] <ravigehlot> shoky: I noticed that jsfiddle is outputting my HTML..not the changes done by jQuery. What am I doing wrong?
[09:13:40] <shoky> outputting where?
[09:13:56] <shoky> what changes..
[09:14:41] <ravigehlot> shoky: when I click on "Run", it doesn't show my JSON object
[09:14:47] <ravigehlot> shoky: it is showing the HTML output
[09:14:59] <shoky> i can't see what you're doing without a link..
[09:15:07] <shoky> why would it show the JSON object
[09:15:51] <ravigehlot> shoky: look at the same link that you sent me.
[09:15:55] <ravigehlot> shoky: click on Run
[09:16:03] <shoky> ok?
[09:16:05] <ravigehlot> shoky: then look at the Result screen
[09:16:09] <ravigehlot> shoky: what do you see?
[09:16:16] <shoky> what i'm supposed to.. the table
[09:16:26] <shoky> console.log  logs to the console, not to the DOM
[09:16:33] <ravigehlot> shoky: you are right. lol
[09:16:36] <ravigehlot> shoky: sorry
[09:16:59] <jop008> I am looking for nice looking widgets for jquery mobile to make my site more fancy anyone using one of them?
[09:17:18] <pedda> hi there
[09:17:55] <pedda> i need a helping hand on how to load images and provide those to my canvas
[09:18:58] <pedda> i found some approach on the internet using the load method (alternatively onload pure js function) and getting access to the dimensions of loaded image
[09:19:38] <pedda> but how do i save provide those outside the onload/load() method?
[09:20:12] <shoky> save provide?
[09:20:33] <pedda> -save
[09:20:42] <pedda> sorry
[09:21:31] <shoky> not sure what you mean still.. you just need to make sure you're accessing the image (or its dimensions) after the load callback has fired
[09:22:12] <shoky> meaning you'll be doing stuff in a callback. might want to look up jquery's deferreds/promises APIs and $.when to make things more manageable
[09:22:58] <pedda> shoky i tried this code for example: http://pastebin.com/n1iwihCG
[09:23:18] <shoky> no, you can't return stuff from there
[09:23:26] <shoky> don't try to use stuff outside a callback, that won't work
[09:24:31] <pedda> hmm well. my initial task is i want to create a Kinetic.Image by the help of the kineticjs library
[09:24:48] <pedda> i need to pass an image object to the constructor of kinetic
[09:25:19] <pedda> but i also want to pass the image dimensions, especially to recalcuiate in aspect ration
[09:25:21] <pedda> -n
[09:25:46] <shoky> ok, you can do that in the callback
[09:25:47] <pedda> and i'm kind of dump how to structure this in my code
[09:26:27] <shoky> and here's a simple example of using deferreds to split up your callbacks  http://pastebin.com/PRi88u77
[09:27:40] <shoky> the "done" callback on the bottom will only be called after the deferred is resolved in line 13
[09:28:37] <pedda> i will take a look at this approach now.. thx for pointing me :)
[09:37:46] <Velveeta> +1 for deferreds, huzzah!
[09:39:15] <deed02392> could someone advise how to add this with jQuery? http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/build.html
[09:39:42] <deed02392> I have generated output with the ipv6 and jquery.URI.js module and tried to include it via content_scripts (chrome extension) but it doesn't get injected
[09:47:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: heyyy!!! hows it going bud? :)
[09:47:47] <TeddyMurray> is anyone familiar with this? #.Upt0PMRDuJA -- its appearing after my url trying to track down what's causing it, its random
[10:46:36] <gordian> what's the best way to contiually get the height of an element?
[10:47:03] <Velveeta> why do you need to continually get the height?
[10:47:05] <gordian> i have a navbar which collapses and expands and i want to store the height in a variable and update that variable if the height changes
[10:47:27] <gordian> guess i don't "continually" need the height
[10:47:35] <gordian> apologies for my poor wording
[10:47:53] <Velveeta> do you need the height at various steps during its animation of opening and closing also?
[10:48:04] <Velveeta> or just when a new section has opened or closed and the animation is done?
[10:50:17] <coRz> gordian, simple use css.. display: inline-block
[10:50:26] <coRz> will recalculate the new height for you
[10:50:44] <coRz> on the navbar ofc
[10:51:32] <Velveeta> yeah if ithis is just about trying to size your navbar appropriately, you can just use css… if this is about sizing something in relation to the navbar, you might need to get its height and size it manually
[10:51:57] <coRz> I think he adds new items to the navbar but sets the height staticly
[10:52:06] <Velveeta> ahhhhh gotcha, that's no bueno
[10:52:21] <coRz> so the new items wont increase the height
[10:52:39] <coRz> lol
[10:52:44] <Velveeta> right
[10:54:58] <grafi> increase the size of your navbar with one simple trick
[10:55:02] <grafi> *cough*
[10:55:30] <coRz> woot?
[10:56:03] <grafi> thats advertisement
[10:56:43] <gordian> Velveeta: ideally when it's done animating i'd like to get the height
[10:57:09] <Velveeta> gordian: so, let's hear a use case real quick, so we can give you the best advice for what you're actually using this for
[10:57:10] <coRz> hehe
[10:57:22] <gordian> ok
[10:57:38] <gordian> i have a fixed position navbar
[10:57:39] <Velveeta> is this just you adding items to an existing nav list, or just wanting to expand/contract those nav menu items, or is this something you're needing to size in relation to that nav list
[10:57:49] <gordian> within a <section>
[10:58:06] <gordian> so i add padding to the <section>
[10:58:29] <gordian> when i click the navbar and it expands, the padding needs to equal the height of the navbar after it expands (or collapses)
[10:58:40] <gordian> so there's enough space within the section to display the navbar
[10:58:53] <gordian> if that's still unclear i apologize, still haven't had lunch yet
[10:58:54] <gordian> ;-)
[10:59:06] <Velveeta> can you whip up a jsfiddle example of a sample of your markup?
[10:59:07] <coRz> gordian, thats not a javascript problem
[10:59:23] <coRz> gordian, correct css will fix it and will be alot faster than js
[10:59:36] <Velveeta> definitely, if that's the only issue going on
[10:59:58] <gordian> mkay
[11:00:19] <coRz> gordian, if you post example on jsfiddle ill check it out
[11:00:26] <gordian> yes let me do that after i eat
[11:00:30] <gordian> will you be here for a bit?
[11:03:00] <coRz> ill try ;)
[11:04:24] <Velveeta> i'll be here for a while also, i have an entire day of football ahead of me
[11:04:34] <grafi> football
[11:04:37] <grafi> or football
[11:04:38] <grafi> :p
[11:04:51] <Velveeta> football, as in actual football……. from amurrika
[11:05:00] <grafi> so not actual football
[11:05:01] <grafi> :P
[11:05:05] <Velveeta> so yes actual football :D
[11:05:17] <grafi> xD
[11:05:20] <Velveeta> that other football is actually called american soccer
[11:05:31] <Velveeta> when they play it in other countries, that's the term they should be using ;)
[11:05:33] <grafi> not outside of america its not
[11:05:41] <grafi> hahaha
[11:05:42] <coRz> guys i think on making a browser game html5 to make some money :p
[11:05:52] <grafi> lets call it "freedom football"
[11:05:52] <grafi> ^^
[11:06:03] <Velveeta> you can call soccer whatever you want ;)
[11:06:17] <grafi> just dont call it soccer^^
[11:06:23] <coRz> people spend alot of money on online games
[11:06:28] <Velveeta> you can even call it soccer if you want :D
[11:06:32] <grafi> :D
[11:06:50] <grafi> coRz whats the elevator pitch for your game idea ^^
[11:07:24] <coRz> Im still thinking about it prolly will be something with fantasy elements of rpg
[11:07:33] <coRz> and extend end game content
[11:07:36] <grafi> that sounds expensive to make
[11:07:42] <coRz> nah
[11:07:43] <Velveeta> make an online final fantasy
[11:07:43] <coRz> html 5
[11:07:50] <coRz> there is already
[11:07:57] <Velveeta> make an html5 ff7
[11:07:59] <coRz> and if ill make one its copyright
[11:08:53] <coRz> almost all the online browser games are written with Flash
[11:09:02] <grafi> because closed source
[11:09:07] <coRz> yeah
[11:09:25] <grafi> and easier animations and stuff
[11:09:26] <grafi> :P
[11:09:43] <coRz> I need to find a way to make money :./
[11:09:47] <grafi> because "html 5" is terrible :p
[11:10:10] <grafi> you could always start working ^^
[11:10:11] <Velveeta> html5 isn't terrible, unless you try to make it do terrible things :D
[11:10:35] <grafi> such as?
[11:10:45] <Velveeta> such as making high-end games
[11:10:54] <coRz> grafi, im working :) project manager and team leader at the company i work at
[11:10:59] <grafi> or replacing flash as a video player
[11:11:01] <grafi> <.<
[11:11:08] <coRz> Lookin to make moar!!
[11:11:13] <grafi> and that doesnt get you enough money oô
[11:11:24] <Velveeta> i don't see a problem with html5's video tag, but then i haven't really used it..
[11:11:27] <coRz> its enough but my dreams are further than that
[11:11:40] <Velveeta> but when i have youtube in html5 format, i don't have any issues with it
[11:11:48] <grafi> Im either just too dumb or its really shitty :P
[11:11:56] <coRz> lol
[11:12:15] <grafi> well for one its very annoying that there is no single source format that you can use
[11:12:37] <shoky> what company is that, coRz?
[11:12:44] <grafi> zynga
[11:12:45] <Velveeta> you mean like flv?
[11:12:45] <grafi> xD
[11:13:02] <coRz> nah lol im from Israel
[11:13:14] <grafi> i mean you can put an mp4 into you flashplayer and everyone with flash will be able to play the video
[11:13:43] <Velveeta> right, but that's not a problem with the video tag in html5 at all, that's a codec issue
[11:13:53] <Velveeta> flash adds that programmatic layer of abstraction to help facilitate that
[11:14:08] <grafi> html video i think you need at least 3 video formats/codecs to support the major browsers
[11:14:40] <Velveeta> as far as i understand, you can embed whatever type of video file you want, so long as the client has a codec to support it
[11:14:49] <Velveeta> but like i said, i haven't used it myself yet
[11:15:01] <grafi> sure
[11:15:23] <grafi> but every browser has its own preference
[11:15:32] <coRz> sry dc
[11:15:38] <grafi> so that sucks :P
[11:15:52] <Velveeta> but while you can embed whatever video type you want inside of flash, you still require the client to have flash installed, so there's still an expectation that they have some 3rd party package installed
[11:16:00] <coRz> how old are you all?
[11:16:08] <tw2113> 150
[11:16:11] <Velveeta> i'm 12

[11:26:13] <tw2113> turning 31 isn't anything, all you have to do is keep living
[11:26:20] <tw2113> easy!
[11:26:36] <grafi> haha
[11:26:42] <tw2113> wanna impress me with that, live on the streets of Chicago or something
[11:26:44] <shoky> living for 31 years has not been "easy"
[11:26:55] <grafi> you poor soul
[11:26:57] <shoky> having to eat and sleep every single day, come on...
[11:27:06] <grafi> dont forget breathe
[11:27:15] <coRz> So what do you think about my idea creating an online game or a private server i think here in israel it will do good
[11:27:16] <tw2113> "every single day" not a requirement
[11:27:16] * shoky boos
[11:27:33] <tw2113> you can go days without eating and still survive
[11:27:36] <coRz> kids are spending loads of money everyday on online games
[11:27:39] <tw2113> then just binge to get back to your former self
[11:27:46] <shoky> ok i'll try
[11:28:27] <TeddyMurray> hey shoky, do you think you could help me with a css issue?
[11:28:38] <jita> I have a table with ui-sortable class, the select inside td does not work. Whenever I click on it, dropdown does not work but up down keys work fine. Any idea ?
[11:28:38] <shoky> coRz mmm sure, if you got an idea for a good game, then it's a good idea i guess :P
[11:28:50] <TeddyMurray> for some reason my stylesheet isnt being applied anymore
[11:29:02] <coRz> ani hoshev seh efshar laasot yam kesef im ze
[11:29:13] <shoky> TeddyMurray: ask away, someone will answer if they know ;p
[11:29:24] <TeddyMurray> http://boldpix.com/ youll see the stylesheet isnt being applied
[11:29:39] <TeddyMurray> no one in #css is answerin
[11:29:42] <TeddyMurray> answering*
[11:29:49] <shoky> coRz: english please ;] yes if you got a good idea and good business model etc.. then you can make a lot of money :D
[11:29:54] <coRz> whats the problem Teddy?
[11:30:29] <coRz> shoky, donation/gifts is the best business for online games
[11:30:35] <TeddyMurray> coRz, index.css isn't being processed
[11:30:41] <TeddyMurray> its being downloaded though because i checked in chrome inspector
[11:31:02] <TeddyMurray> coRz, what kind of game are you making?
[11:31:55] <Velveeta> teddymurray: could it be a caching issue?
[11:31:58] <coRz> Teddy remove the * {}
[11:32:29] <TeddyMurray> Velveeta, i don't know, i cleared my cache several times, do you mean server cache?
[11:33:00] <Velveeta> nah i meant client cache, but i haven't looked at the css file itself, looks like corz did though, i'd try his suggestion
[11:33:10] <Velveeta> you could have a rule that's breaking the stylesheet from further processing
[11:33:17] <coRz> yeah
[11:33:21] <coRz> thats what happening
[11:33:40] <TeddyMurray> i just removed the * {}
[11:33:42] <TeddyMurray> same result
[11:34:38] <gordian> coRz: too much to put into a jsfiddle
[11:34:44] <gordian> can i pm you a link to my staging server?
[11:34:53] <coRz> yehah
[11:35:14] <shoky> TeddyMurray: i'd make sure that your server is serving the css with the right mimetype text/css
[11:35:21] <shoky> because currently it's not
[11:35:24] <TeddyMurray> ohh
[11:35:34] <TeddyMurray> how do i change that?
[11:35:49] <shoky> on your server :P
[11:35:56] <gordian> coRz: sent
[11:35:59] <coRz> TeddyMurray, load the css before the javascript
[11:35:59] <TeddyMurray> i think something in htaccess might be changing it
[11:36:51] <shoky> TeddyMurray   you can try:  AddType text/css .css
[11:38:41] <TeddyMurray> ill try that
[11:38:49] <TeddyMurray> its weird though, i didnt change anything and then it started loading like this
[11:40:57] <TeddyMurray> shoky, where did you check the mimetype? is it in chrome inspector?
[11:41:28] <TeddyMurray> yeah its passing as application/octet-stream
[11:41:39] <TeddyMurray> so are my javascript files
[11:41:44] <shoky> TeddyMurray: yah. also getting warnings in the console:  Resource interpreted as Stylesheet but transferred with MIME type application/octet-stream
[11:41:58] <shoky> yep getting warnings about the js and png too
[11:42:13] <Velveeta> do you own/control the server?
[11:42:16] <TeddyMurray> i have this: ForceType application/octet-stream
[11:42:16] <TeddyMurray> <FilesMatch "(?i)\.jpe?g$">
[11:42:16] <TeddyMurray>     ForceType image/jpeg
[11:42:16] <TeddyMurray> </FilesMatch>
[11:42:20] <TeddyMurray> sorry for so many lines
[11:42:34] <shoky> uhm
[11:43:25] <TeddyMurray> it was in a tutorial for uploading files securely
[11:43:30] <TeddyMurray> images*
[11:43:31] <shoky> ForceType application/octet-stream
[11:43:36] <shoky> what do you think that does :P
[11:43:42] <TeddyMurray> force the mimetype
[11:43:55] <shoky> ok, is something not clear?
[11:44:28] <TeddyMurray> i need it to work with that still existing in the code
[11:44:32] <TeddyMurray> addtype didn't work
[11:44:39] <TeddyMurray> maybe i should put it before the forcetype?
[11:45:04] <shoky> no i doubt the addtype will do anything if you have that forcetype..
[11:45:27] <TeddyMurray> i think i have a solution
[11:45:28] <TeddyMurray> one moment
[11:45:49] <shoky> guess you have to add another match thing like you did for the jpegs.. donno why you'd do it like that though
[11:46:06] <shoky> why have the ForceType for EVERY file you're serving..?
[11:46:54] <TeddyMurray> yayayay
[11:46:57] <TeddyMurray> its fixed mostly
[11:47:12] <TeddyMurray> i removed the forcetype for every file like you said
[11:47:17] <TeddyMurray> then added a filesmatch for css
[11:47:26] <TeddyMurray> thank you

[13:25:06] <mathi> hi
[13:25:20] <mathi> can anyone compare markItUp and CKEditor ?
[13:54:07] <maslo> Hi all
[13:54:36] <pedda> how can i access a method of my plugin within a load method within another method of my plugin?
[13:59:19] <shoky> pedda: totally depends on how you've written your plugin. generally.. you call functions just like you always call them in javascript
[13:59:52] <pedda> i'm not good at jquery at all so i decided to rely on the jquery plugin boilerplate
[14:00:03] <shoky> there are many jquery plugin boilerplates :P
[14:00:32] <pedda> basically this:
[14:00:33] <pedda> https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/blob/master/src/jquery.boilerplate.js
[14:00:54] <pedda> i extended this file by some custom methods
[14:01:29] <pedda> i'm about to create a slideshow based on kineticjs as well
[14:01:49] <pedda> i thought, when i rely on such a boilerplate, my code will get structured by itself
[14:02:07] <pedda> a bit more than i'm capable of at leastr
[14:02:09] <pedda> -r
[14:02:48] <shoky> ok. so if you have an instance of the plugin you just call instance.methodName(args);   and if you want to directly call the function you can do:  Plugin.prototype.methodName(...)  or if you wanna set "this" to something you can do Plugin.prototype.methodName.call(context, args..)  and "this" will be set to context inside the call
[14:03:27] <Tomashe> hey guys
[14:03:36] <Tomashe> i keep getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'on' of null  although the jquery is there :/
[14:03:40] <shoky> and no this doesn't structure your code by itself. what you see is what you get. and if you don't know javascript, now would be a good time to learn (now as in before attempting to make your own plugin)
[14:03:42] <Tomashe> im using 2.0.3
[14:04:01] <shoky> Tomashe: seems you're calling it on  null
[14:04:09] <shoky> like.. var x = null;  null.on();  :P
[14:04:15] <shoky> er i mean x.on()
[14:04:19] <Tomashe> $(".toporders").on("click",function() {
[14:04:27] <shoky> got a link?
[14:04:34] <Tomashe> u got that on top <div class="toporders">
[14:05:07] <Tomashe> i sent u the link
[14:05:37] <Tomashe> the code is on the top .. on the blue square on the header of the page
[14:05:49] <shoky> Tomashe: you're doing jquery.noConflict ..
[14:05:56] <pedda> shoky what if i want to call my Plugin.prototype.someMethod within Plugin.prototype.someOtherMethod ?
[14:05:59] <Tomashe> so..?
[14:06:10] <shoky> Tomashe: so that removes the global $
[14:06:23] <Tomashe> what should i put instead?
[14:06:37] <Tomashe> how should i ran this $(".toporders").on("click",function() { without the $
[14:06:38] <maslo> How to call this type of jQuery plugins? When menu is presented by stripes (of images) and on hovering, images become bigger. For example this one: http://www.thepetedesign.com/demos/fullpagenav_demo.html
[14:06:42] <shoky> stop using noConflict?  or use $j  i guess..
[14:06:48] <shoky> http://shipi.co.il/js/jquery/jquery-noconflict.js
[14:06:55] <shoky> oops
[14:07:03] <maslo> Does this effect has its own name? I can't find just at least one other such a plugin
[14:07:03] <pedda> ;(function($){ … })(jQuery); @Tomashe
[14:07:24] <Tomashe> doesnt matter
[14:07:32] <Tomashe> so i should remove the noconflict?
[14:07:40] <shoky> i don't know.. why did you add it
[14:07:40] <Tomashe> but it was tehre for a reason i guess
[14:07:47] <Tomashe> i did not the older coder did
[14:07:56] <shoky> heh.. then sure, remove it :)
[14:08:20] <Tomashe> ok lets see what happened lol
[14:08:23] <pedda> what if i want to call my Plugin.prototype.someMethod within Plugin.prototype.someOtherMethod ?
[14:08:29] <pedda> @shoky
[14:08:34] <Tomashe> still same errror
[14:09:27] <shoky> pedda: generally you'd just do this.someOtherMethod()   assuming "this" was properly set
[14:09:34] <Tomashe> so what do u think the issue is now?
[14:10:02] <pedda> i'm struggeling because i want to create a method which loads an image from json and
[14:10:07] <shoky> Tomashe: same issue, tabnav.js
[14:10:25] <pedda> i need to rely on the onload method or jquery load()
[14:10:40] <Tomashe> what u mean same issue, but i removed the conflict one
[14:10:48] <pedda> within that method my "this" is not set properly
[14:10:51] <shoky> Tomashe: tabnav.js line 1
[14:11:44] <shoky> pedda:  you can do  var self = this;   bla.load(function() {  self.whatever()   });
[14:11:47] <Tomashe> ok i removed that and now the website js isnt working
[14:11:48] <Tomashe> hehe
[14:12:00] <Tomashe> i changed the $j to $
[14:12:02] <Tomashe> and same :/
[14:12:05] <Tomashe> nothing works
[14:12:07] <shoky> Tomashe: oh wtf the page also uses prototype ...
[14:12:15] <shoky> Tomashe: so that's why the noConflict was there :)
[14:12:29] <Tomashe> ok i got an idea
[14:12:31] <shoky> Tomashe:  put back the noConflict i guess. just use $j or jQuery instead of $
[14:12:40] <Tomashe> yeah
[14:12:40] <Tomashe> :)
[14:12:44] <Tomashe> this is what im doing now
[14:12:44] <shoky> Tomashe: or what pedda suggested:  ;(function($){ … })(jQuery);
[14:12:55] <shoky> put that around your scripts that use $
[14:13:10] <shoky> that's the best solution really
[14:13:10] <Tomashe> works like a charm
[14:25:32] <krambiorix> hi, how can i remove all values from all input fields in atable row in one time?
[14:31:11] <shoky> $('tr.myRow input').val('')
[14:45:13] <rootcoma> Would there be any reason to switch $(".modal-table > tbody > tr").click(...) to $(".modal-table tbody tr").click(...)?
[14:45:52] <rootcoma> From what I understand '>' means 'the first found' or something to that extent, and I want every row in the table to be clickable
[14:46:10] <rootcoma> But the syntax with '>' does what I want. So is there any reason to change it?
[14:56:10] <hugo_m> http://jsfiddle.net/Sa7AP/ <-- why does the background scroll when scrolling inside the pink container?
[14:57:04] <hugo_m> when you've reached either the top or bottom of the pink container
[15:31:43] <xp_prg> hi all, I need to load an external javascript file and I don't have access to the raw html to put it into the <head> tag, would jQuery.getScript() do the same thing?
[15:34:08] <ShortWave> xp_prg: Yup
[15:34:22] <ShortWave> xp_prg: With limitations...
[15:34:50] <xp_prg> well I want to accomplish the exact same thing as putting it in the <head> area
[15:35:08] <ShortWave> I think the only thing you lose is document.ready()
[15:35:12] <ShortWave> IIRC
[15:35:18] <xp_prg> oh ok
[15:35:24] <xp_prg> I guess I will just try it :>
[15:35:33] <xp_prg> thanks!
[15:35:39] <ShortWave> Note that it's an eval
[15:35:48] <ShortWave> which, that's more or less what the interpreter does anyway
[15:36:06] <xp_prg> I heart you
[15:36:30] <xp_prg> what is your favorite javascript mockup site, is it plunk?
[15:36:38] <ShortWave> jsfiddle probably
[15:36:44] <ShortWave> It's what I screw with most often
[15:36:48] <xp_prg> ok
[15:37:15] <ShortWave> I'm wading through a pile of namespace & multi-version support issues.
[15:37:17] <ShortWave> Gaaaah
[15:39:05] <xp_prg> ShortWave what other javascript libraries/architectures do you like besides jquery?
[15:41:02] <jsc802_> i have a question- do i still need to use jsonp if i am sending data to an external domain but dont need to get anything back?
[15:42:42] <jsc802_> i guess i could just test it
[15:49:47] <mathi> hey
[15:49:53] <mathi> anyone using markItUp plugin?
[15:58:37] <chao241> hello, I'm pretty new to this and was wondering if anyone here has experience with the validation plugin
[16:23:06] <chao241> Does anyone here have experience making custom form validation?
[16:23:54] <ShortWave> I'm getting some really odd behavior from JQuery when I try to run ajax requests. The browser inspector shows me that data came back, but I'm getting nothing showing up for the handler to process.
[16:44:29] <shoky> ShortWave: got some code?
[16:48:42] <Sal> is there a way to get the path of the website?
[16:49:42] <Sal> if i have: http://localhost/mysite/module/index.php i there a way to get /mysite/module ?
[16:50:20] <Sal> i mean all the dirs that go from the domain to file
[16:50:23] <shoky> window.location.pathname
[16:51:01] <Sal> i tried that, it's not returning what i want
[16:51:45] <Sal> it returns what the browser windows says, but not the real file path
[16:52:04] <Velveeta> there's no way to determine what the actual file path is from within a browser
[16:52:17] <Sal> the windows path, could be changed be a mod_rewrite rule
[16:52:17] <Velveeta> it can only show you what the url path is, you could have that mapped to anything on the drive
[16:52:38] <Sal> hmmm
[16:52:43] <Sal> so? what could be the solution?
[16:52:56] <Sal> should i pass the path from php to a js variable?
[16:52:57] <shoky> don't try to do that
[16:53:06] <shoky> why do you need the server path
[16:54:37] <Sal> ok, this is my problem: i'm calling a php service using ajax. the service path is: mywebsite/public/services/file.php
[16:55:03] <Sal> and i can only call it using public/services/file.php
[16:55:19] <Sal> because the mysite could change depending on where i upload it
[16:55:36] <Sal> mysit=mywebsite
[16:55:55] <Sal> so, i need to know the correct path of the file
[16:56:23] <Sal> i don't see any other way, unless , as i said, i pass the current path from php to a js variable
[16:56:52] <Sal> you guys never had this problem?
[16:56:53] <Velveeta> you'll probably want to set some configuration variable for your url base, and use that to construct your urls
[16:57:33] <Sal> Velveeta, an automatic way would be better. change the config on every deployment is a pain
[16:57:37] <Velveeta> so you would just write out something like <a href="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>/public/services/file.php">
[16:58:00] <Velveeta> an automatic way would be better for sure, but you'll need to write a build or deployment script to update your config file for that
[16:58:12] <Velveeta> it's entirely doable, but it's outside the scope of the #jquery channel for that sort of thing
[16:58:58] <Sal> i know, i cam here because i thougth that maybe some of you jquery guys have already found a solution
[16:59:20] <xp_prg> hi all I am using jquery.getScript and inside the success function I am defiing another script, I am trying to do this: $('#myid').bind('click', connect); it says that $ is not defined
[16:59:46] <Sal> Velveeta, have you ever done it?
[16:59:51] <Sal> do it
[16:59:52] <xp_prg> can I use the keyword jQuery to do the same thing somehow?
[16:59:53] <Velveeta> well, to your original question, there is no client-side solution… the details of the directory structure on the server are hidden from the client… any path similarities are just coincidental :)
[17:00:17] <Sal> what about using cookies?
[17:00:19] <Velveeta> sal: i haven't done it for multiple deployment environments, no, but i used to do a lot of oscommerce work, which used that sort of config variable to construct its links
[17:00:21] <Sal> could that be better?
[17:00:43] <shoky> xp_prg maybe you called jQuery.noConflict..
[17:00:55] <xp_prg> ya I did
[17:01:03] <shoky> xp_prg then $ is not defined
[17:01:14] <shoky> and yes, $ is jQuery
[17:01:15] <xp_prg> sorry I am doing inside of drupal 7, it is quite complicated that is why this is not straight forward
[17:01:28] <xp_prg> so anywhere I am using $ I can just put jQuery right?
[17:01:35] <Velveeta> sal: sure, you could set a cookie with the base url, but you're still gonna have to use that to construct the urls you're trying to hit
[17:01:37] <shoky> if you did jQuery.getScript then you can do jQuery('#myid')
[17:01:46] <xp_prg> ok I heart you thanks!
[17:02:09] <shoky> xp_prg: just put this around your code that uses $:    (function($) { ... })(jQuery);
[17:02:16] <Sal> Velveeta, but, i'm using an ajax call, and inside an ajax call, i can't use inline php
[17:02:18] <shoky> and you don't need to worry about it
[17:02:23] <Sal> or can i?
[17:02:41] <Sal> no, because its inside a .js file. not on the main index.php
[17:02:52] <Sal> its a damn mess
[17:02:58] <Velveeta> the ajax response can have the baseurl in it
[17:03:11] <Velveeta> it'll be hitting a php endpoint, and in that php script, php syntax is perfectly valid
[17:03:17] <Velveeta> just write it out to the response stream
[17:03:20] <Sal> its the call that is giving me problems:)
[17:03:25] <xp_prg> Uncaught TypeError: Property 'jQuery' of object [object Object] is not a function
[17:03:33] <Sal> the first call to the php service
[17:03:43] <Velveeta> it's still not a great solution, mostly because i detest cookies, but it would work, yes
[17:03:46] <Sal> need to put a path there
[17:03:51] <xp_prg> I am dong this inside the success function of jQuery.getScript
[17:04:01] <Sal> i know, i hate them too
[17:04:06] <shoky> xp_prg: doing "this" ?
[17:04:25] <ShortWave> grrr
[17:04:43] <ShortWave> This drupal plugin is using a stupidly old version of Jquery
[17:04:45] <ShortWave> 1.4.4
[17:04:50] <xp_prg> jQuery('#connectLink').bind('click', connect);
[17:04:52] <Velveeta> sal: if your first call is to the php service, and you need that base url data in order to make that call, then the first call is too late
[17:05:03] <Velveeta> you'd need to write it out to the page on the initial page load
[17:05:06] <xp_prg> ShortWave that is exactly what I am dealing with!
[17:05:13] <xp_prg> I am on version 1.4.4 as well inside of drupal
[17:05:21] <Sal> so i think that the best solution could be to let the index.php write this: <script type='text/javascript'>var _URL_ = <?php echo $url; ?>;</script>
[17:05:30] <ShortWave> oh, joy.
[17:05:34] <ShortWave> You using openLayers also?
[17:05:39] <ShortWave> Because that would just ridiculous.
[17:05:42] <shoky> xp_prg i guess some script is calling jQuery.noConflict(true)  ..
[17:05:44] <ShortWave> just be ridiculous.
[17:05:49] <Sal> yep
[17:05:54] <shoky> xp_prg did you try what i said:  <shoky> xp_prg: just put this around your code that uses $:    (function($) { ... })(jQuery);
[17:05:57] <xp_prg> shoky ok, let me try something
[17:06:06] <xp_prg> I did try that and it didn't work either
[17:06:12] <ShortWave> I'm getting this ugliness
[17:06:13] <ShortWave> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined panels.js:6
[17:06:13] <ShortWave> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined overlay-parent.js:907
[17:06:13] <ShortWave> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined
[17:06:16] <ShortWave> ack
[17:06:17] <xp_prg> I am using the javascript node edit module
[17:06:21] <ShortWave> That was supposed to be one line, apologies
[17:06:28] <xp_prg> ShortWave are you in drupal 7?
[17:06:32] <ShortWave> Yup
[17:06:36] <xp_prg> wow me too!
[17:06:54] <Sal> Velveeta, thanks for the chat
[17:07:08] <Velveeta> shortwave: that sounds like it's from a more recent version of jquery, they dropped support for $.browser, which is where the msie property used to live
[17:07:14] <ShortWave> Yes
[17:08:25] <ShortWave> There's a module that supposedly does the update for you.
[17:08:27] <xp_prg> by jove I think its working
[17:08:36] <ShortWave> it only boosts it up to 1.8 tho
[17:09:04] <ShortWave> Let's see if I just broke it
[17:10:45] <ShortWave> With the right modules, drupal is kinda the bomb.
[17:11:13] <Velveeta> i'm not sure how drupal is, but i know joomla is a fuckin mess under the hood
[17:12:50] <xp_prg> ShortWave it totally is, you using json rpc?
[17:23:28] <ShortWave> xp_prg: Sorta.
[17:23:33] <ShortWave> xp_prg: Using a JSON mapping provider.
[17:24:26] <xp_prg> I use drupal services
[17:24:29] <xp_prg> why don't you?
[17:26:07] <xp_prg> what other modules do you like just curious?
[17:26:13] <xp_prg> why did you pick drupal 7?
[17:30:57] <hugo_m> http://jsfiddle.net/Sa7AP/1/ <-- anyone know why the stopPropagation doesn't work
[17:33:22] <coldhead> hugo_m: try return false instead of stopPropagation
[17:33:51] <shoky> hugo_m: you're calling stopPropagation when the handler is on <body> anyway. so it stops propagation up to <html> but you dont have any handler on <html>
[17:34:20] <hugo_m> returning false prevents the scrolling inside the pink container
[17:34:39] <hugo_m> shoky i dont understand
[17:34:57] <shoky> stopPropagation should stop the event from bubbling up to ancestor elements
[17:35:12] <hugo_m> right
[17:35:15] <shoky> both of your event handlers are on the same <body> element. so you're stopping it from bubbling up from <body>
[17:35:18] <hugo_m> thats what i was hoping it would do
[17:35:32] <shoky> so if you had a handler on <html> it wouldn't fire
[17:35:32] <hugo_m> hmm well i can try removing that
[17:35:39] <hugo_m> but i had no luck
[17:36:31] <hugo_m> http://jsfiddle.net/Sa7AP/
[17:37:16] <hugo_m> if you scroll the contents of the pink container, once the pink container reaches its max or min, the body starts to scroll
[17:39:00] <hugo_m> i think its called over scroll
[17:43:31] <hugo_m> what works is if i have an if statement that checks to see if i try to scroll beyond the pink container and then prevent default on that
[17:43:43] <hugo_m> but i don't understand why stop propagation doesn't work
[17:49:25] <hugo_m> any thoughts
[17:50:19] <Velveeta> because there's a difference between stopping event propagation and preventing the default browser action
[17:50:41] <Velveeta> stopping propagation doesn't prevent the browser from scrolling, it only stops any additional scroll event callbacks from firing
[17:51:21] <hugo_m> oh it doesn't prevent the browser from scrolling?
[17:51:29] <Velveeta> nope, that's preventDefault does
[17:51:42] <Velveeta> and if you return false, it does both a preventDefault *and* a stopImmediatePropagation
[17:51:54] <Velveeta> or maybe it's stopPropagation, i can't remember which one return false does
[17:52:01] <hugo_m> so it still tries to scroll the innermost element and then bubbles up to all the remaining elements?
[17:52:56] <Velveeta> well, scroll events don't actually bubble
[17:53:29] <Velveeta> it scrolls the body because you're at one extreme end of that inner element's scrollbar, so there's nowhere to go except to the body's scrollbar at that point
[17:54:18] <hugo_m> so if i trap it with a scroll event would that work instead?
[17:54:34] <hugo_m> and call preventdefault
[17:54:59] <raj> how do I only add $p if it isn't already in <div></div>? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/g8kCQ/
[17:55:01] <xp_prg> ShortWave you here?!!!
[17:55:14] <xp_prg> I got my stuff to work, just thought I would tell you what I did
[17:55:36] <Velveeta> hugo_m: yes, if you preventDefault from the inner container, it should stop the body from scrolling also, but only if the scroll is occuring within the inner container
[17:56:05] <hugo_m> does it have to be the topmost element when using the query on delegate?
[17:56:06] <Velveeta> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/g8kCQ/1/
[17:56:23] <Velveeta> hugo_m: i'm not sure what that question actually means..
[17:56:32] <hugo_m> because I've tried to change it to: http://jsfiddle.net/Sa7AP/3/
[17:56:32] <raj> Velveeta, I need to check the object though
[17:56:37] <raj> cuz the object will also have data and stuff in it
[17:56:46] <raj> can I do :not(:has($p)) ?
[17:58:30] <Velveeta> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/g8kCQ/4/
[17:59:05] <Velveeta> you'll notice that it still writes out 5 times… that's because each time you loop and initialize $p to $('<p>test</p>'), you're creating a new instance of that element
[17:59:28] <Velveeta> this will show what you're expecting to see, i think: http://jsfiddle.net/g8kCQ/5/
[17:59:47] <imsky> it's easier to just test for a class. why bother with filters on the parent?
[17:59:51] <raj> why does that work Velveeta ?
[18:00:47] <Velveeta> raj: because you're creating $p outside of that loop, so each iteration of the loop is comparing against the original $p
[18:01:08] <Velveeta> imsky: he didn't use a class or say anything about a class, so i was working with what he gave me for his use case
[18:01:13] <raj> oh, I see
[18:01:21] <raj> unfortunately, it's not what I'm looking to do
[18:01:25] <imsky> Velveeta, ^
[18:01:27] <raj> alternatively, I can just make sure none (of a certain class) have the same .data() object
[18:01:47] <Velveeta> imsky: what were you pointing at?
[18:01:58] <imsky> some quick evidence of inapplicability ;)
[18:02:23] <Velveeta> yeah no doubt, especially since the question changed when i answered it
[18:02:33] <raj> it did?
[18:02:35] <imsky> that's why you suggest the easier problem to solve :P
[18:02:58] <imsky> raj, what do you need this for?
[18:03:12] <Velveeta> raj: yes, you said you needed to make sure $p didn't exist in a div before adding it, then when i showed you how, you said that's not what you're looking to do
[18:03:22] <raj> I'm trying to append to a list, but I don't want to add any of the duplicates
[18:03:29] <imsky> raj, how do you define a duplicate?
[18:03:36] <hugo_m> velveeta: any other thoughts on why it doesn't work with on scroll?
[18:03:38] <raj> they may have the same .text(), but the .data() will be different
[18:03:40] <Velveeta> right, do you mean same object reference, or same object value?
[18:03:53] <raj> if the .data() is different, it is not a duplicate
[18:03:58] <raj> and can be added
[18:04:03] <imsky> raj, ok so you need to do this in memory first, then append from a filtered list
[18:04:03] <Velveeta> huge_m: not off the top of my head
[18:04:12] <imsky> don't do it through the DOM
[18:04:14] <raj> imsky, not sure what you mean
[18:04:26] <imsky> raj, filter and check for duplicates in a JS array first
[18:04:27] <hugo_m> it should work right
[18:04:32] <raj> oh, I see
[18:04:38] <Velveeta> raj: you're also gonna need to do a deep compare of the objects, because what you're saying doesn't sound like you're caching object references for comparison
[18:04:43] <imsky> ^
[18:04:46] <imsky> exactly
[18:04:54] <Velveeta> so for example: { color: 'blue' } does not equal { color: 'blue' }
[18:05:21] <raj> k
[18:05:34] <raj> alright, I'll play a little more and see where I fall
[18:05:42] <raj> thank you Velveeta, imsky
[18:05:47] <imsky> yw raj
[18:06:00] <Velveeta> one suggestion you could do
[18:06:07] <Velveeta> potentially, anyway
[18:06:15] <Velveeta> you could use the class check that imsky mentioned
[18:06:24] <Velveeta> and make the class name an md5 hash of a stringified object
[18:06:48] <raj> that sounds overkill, but let me experiment and I'll report back ;)
[18:06:51] <raj> thanks!
[18:06:51] <Velveeta> the only problem will be how different browsers enumerate object properties
[18:06:53] <Velveeta> no problem
[18:07:07] <Velveeta> some will auto alphabetize properties, and some will enumerate them based on the order in which they were added
[18:07:28] <Velveeta> so if you're constructed piecemeal, and the order is different, you may not get the same hash in some browsers, for the same object structure
[18:17:50] <hugo_m> weird
[18:21:28] <starfox21> I am having some trouble with a jquery plugin. On page load I apply the jquery plugin to element X. Then later, the user clicks in a button, and I replace element X, with another element Y which I load via ajax. Then I need to apply the same plugin to Y, but for some reason, when I do, the plugin does not work properly. It seems that the plugin has some internal state, that prevents me from applying it twice like that. What is the easiest way to fix this
[18:24:41] <shoky> starfox21: prolly you need to destroy the plugin instance first before re-initializing it. depends on the plugin tho
[18:24:58] <Sal> back again :)
[18:25:34] <Sal> is there a way to convert this into jquery code' :http://goo.gl/yBO1ez
[18:25:58] <Sal> :http://goo.gl/yBO1ez
[18:26:20] <Sal> sorry for the ":"    http://goo.gl/yBO1ez
[18:26:26] <shoky> Sal: var _server = JSON.parse( $('#jsvars').text() );
[18:26:33] <starfox21> shoky: the issue is that I am not quite sure of how to do that. The plugin in this case is SirTrevor
[18:26:48] <Sal> wow! that short??!!
[18:29:57] <Sal> shoky, not working
[18:30:12] <Sal> does that also read text from this: <script id="jsvars" type="application/json">{"url":"\/oak\/"}</script>
[18:31:12] <shoky> Sal: works fine http://jsfiddle.net/8XMFP/
[18:33:09] <Sal> damn, then why ain it working? hmmm coudl it be because it need to be on document ready?
[18:34:41] <Sal> yep, it was that
[18:34:43] <Sal> thanks
[18:34:57] <starfox21> shoky: is it possible for instance to destroy the instance of jquery and initialize it again?
[18:36:40] <shoky> starfox21: just call .destroy() on the plugin instance
[18:38:43] <shai_> Can I rename jquery-2.0.3.min.js to jquery.js and have it run the same way?
[18:38:47] <shai_> does it depend on a map file
[18:38:58] <shai_> jquery-2.0.3.min.map
[18:39:13] <shoky> shai_: the map file isn't needed. it's just for debugging
[18:39:20] <shai_> shoky, thanks
[18:40:02] <Velveeta> just know that if you change your jquery file to something generic like that, when you upgrade, you'll need to do something to bust the cache on your clients
[18:43:50] <Mentioum> thumbs up for Velveeta helping to avoid one of the most annoying of issues ;)
[18:44:41] <Velveeta> :D
[18:54:12] <sunuslee> hi, i guess most of you know javascript, so, here is my question,  var myObj = {'key1': 'val1'};   how can i get a list of attributes of myObj, i know for .. in, but for .. in can not get methods like toString
[18:54:46] <sunuslee> i mean, all of the methods, including the inherited ones
[18:57:42] <sunuslee> anyone?
[18:58:04] <shoky> sunuslee: toString and others like that are non-enumerable properties, meaning they don't show up when enumerating. you'd have to loop over the prototype chain of the object and use Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj) in the loop to get all properties in the current level
[18:58:53] <sunuslee> shoky: thank you, but how to loop the prototype chain?
[18:58:57] <Velveeta> damn, shoky beat me to it :D

[18:59:29] <sunuslee> shoky:  thank you
[18:59:30] <ShortWave> damn, you know
[18:59:33] <ShortWave> Drupal IS the bomb.
[18:59:57] <hugo_m> anyone can help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/Sa7AP/3/
[19:00:20] <ShortWave> What, exactly, is that?
[19:00:35] <hugo_m> I'm trying to prevent default on scroll
[19:00:41] <ShortWave> A. That text isn't random. :D
[19:00:41] <hugo_m> when scrolling the pink container
[19:00:47] <hugo_m> hehe
[19:01:13] <Velveeta> hugo_m: here's something that might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4770025/how-to-disable-scrolling-temporarily
[19:01:31] <hugo_m> i want the pink container to scroll, but not the container of the pink container
[19:01:32] <ShortWave> for (var a = 0; a  < 80; a++) { str = str + "random text "; str++);
[19:01:34] <Velveeta> the short answer is: you can't disable scrolling with javascript, but you can disable the mousescroll and keyboard scrolling
[19:02:07] <Velveeta> you could always set an overflow: hidden property on the container element while scrolling the inner container maybe
[19:02:10] <ShortWave> I've noticed that browser windows will scroll if the mouse is on a transparent area of an application above it.
[19:06:38] <hugo_m> hmm yea i tried mouse wheel and DOMMouseScroll events too, no luck
[19:07:43] <hugo_m> http://jsfiddle.net/Sa7AP/10/
[19:07:58] <hugo_m> i don't known how to disable just the background scroll
[19:08:06] <hugo_m> not the scroll of the pink container
[19:08:39] <hugo_m> i guess the only way is to check if the pink container is scrolling beyond its bounds
[19:08:43] <hugo_m> and prevent default on that
[19:08:48] <hugo_m> is that the only solution?
[19:09:43] <Velveeta> how about on mouseenter of the pink container, set the outer container's overflow to hidden, and on mouseleave, set it to auto
[19:10:25] <hugo_m> well that i don't want to do because it shifts the content of the background
[19:10:30] <Velveeta> that won't stop a keypress scroll event from happening if the pink container doesn't have mouse focus, but it should nail the mouse use case at least
[19:10:35] <hugo_m> thats why I've been trying to avoid that method
[19:10:51] <hugo_m> avoid shifting of the content from the removal/addition of the scrollbar
[19:10:56] <Velveeta> well, you can try setting the overflow to hidden, and maybe set a margin/padding of 18px or so on the right side
[19:11:05] <Velveeta> and then zero it out and reinstate the scrollbar
[19:11:11] <hugo_m> yea
[19:11:17] <hugo_m> thats what bootstrap 3.0 does
[19:11:24] <hugo_m> twitter bootstrap
[19:11:46] <Velveeta> well then, it sounds like they're not totally horrible
[19:11:55] <Velveeta> but a look under the hood of their javascript components would be to differ :D
[19:12:03] <hugo_m> hehe
[19:18:44] <shoky> hugo_m another option.. http://jsfiddle.net/Sa7AP/12/
[19:19:20] <shoky> getting small flickers but not too bad. most noticable on IE
[20:22:24] <hugo_m> hey shaky i got it with this solution in case you were interested: http://jsfiddle.net/Sa7AP/20/
[20:51:28] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[20:51:37] <Starcraftmazter> how can i create a <p> element with text and append to another element?

[21:19:00] <Dessimat0r> hi, any idea why this isn't working? var $lastMsg = $chatWindow('.message-box:not(.message_notification):last');
[21:19:11] <Dessimat0r> i don't think the program flow gets beyond the point
[21:23:07] <Dessimat0r> $chatWindow is obtained by var $chatWindow = this.$('#chat-contents');, but that's not my code and works 100%
[21:44:14] <jita> Select input is not working because in some event handler it is being oppressed. So I am trying to bind an event handler to select click and I want to perform the original action i.e. shown a dropdown for options instead of oppressing it. Is there a way to do event.executeDefault() action?

[22:19:30] <joroci> hey, i'm using google api to get all my contacts info and i want to create an autocomplete list with all the contacts, the problem is when i loop through the array most of the images aren't loading, i'm guessing because i'm making too many requests to google servers, is there a workaround for this?
[22:34:34] <Siraris> I'm using .prop('checked', true) to check a checkbox, yet the checkbox is not showing that it's being ticked
[22:34:37] <Siraris> Does anyone know why this would dbe?
[22:34:48] <joroci> try
[22:34:51] <joroci> checked checked
[22:35:09] <Siraris> Tried that too
[22:35:14] <Siraris> It doesn't show check state
[22:35:25] <joroci> sec
[22:35:36] <joroci> ih,need to got for 10 min
[22:43:35] <Siraris> Anyone else know?
[22:43:48] <Siraris> Why .prop('checked', true) or .prop('checked', 'checked') doesn't show a visible checkmark?

[23:50:46] <Cork> joroci: browsers is normally limited to a set number of connections (2-6 is quite common)
[23:51:11] <Cork> joroci: the rest of the connections should queue and be done as soon as the other ones are complete
[23:51:32] <Cork> joroci: just make sure you don't run your loop synchronously and it should work fine
