[00:32:26] <Snoopal> hey guys. short question. if have a select field. which is manipulated in $(window).load() by using $('select[name="foo"]').val("bar");  does this also trigger the change event on select[name="foo"] ?
[00:35:58] <sammych> why do jQM tabs still do this :| http://jsbin.com/xadut/2/
[00:36:18] <sammych> (the active state being removed)
[00:40:47] <Cork> Snoopal: no
[00:40:57] <Snoopal> yeah figured it out by myself
[00:40:58] <Cork> Snoopal: you can trigger the event manuallt though
[00:41:07] <Snoopal> .change() add the end and tit works :)
[00:42:00] <Cork> Snoopal: or trigger('change')
[00:42:09] <Cork> (same thing)

[00:58:50] <wa5ted> gosht im not familiar with
[00:58:53] <cors_react> hi, i am trying to get a json response from a public api and work around CORS block. i got this far: $.getJSON("http://pubapi.cryptsy.com/api.php?method=singlemarketdata&marketid=10&callback=?", function(result){    alert(result); });
[00:58:55] <wa5ted> achar
[00:58:58] <wa5ted> ?
[00:59:10] <wa5ted> cors_react: your question willl have to wait
[00:59:19] <cors_react> ok
[00:59:21] <wa5ted> we are having a lively discussion of various methods of
[00:59:42] <cors_react> have fun, i will be back
[00:59:42] <wa5ted> making someone sick through consumption of brown food
[00:59:51] <wa5ted> cors_react: im joking
[00:59:52] <wa5ted> XD
[01:00:01] <cors_react> ha ha
[01:00:06] <cors_react> i believed you
[01:00:17] <grodt> gosht = meat
[01:00:21] <wa5ted> right
[01:00:36] <cors_react> i got the json but also a syntax error: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[01:00:47] <wa5ted> cors_react: so there is a semi colon missing
[01:00:53] <wa5ted> run your code throug ha beautifier
[01:00:59] <wa5ted> and see if you are missing anything
[01:02:47] <cors_react> the semicolon missing was in the json response, not on my code
[01:04:01] <cors_react> and i am not sure where can i find a "ha beatifier", unless you mean something like this one http://jsbeautifier.org/ (which i love)
[01:05:01] <d0de> When using the web audio API on Safari on iOS, can you queue multiple sounds to play from a single user interaction (tap) ?
[01:05:02] <wa5ted> ^^
[01:05:06] <wa5ted> beautifer
[01:05:42] <wa5ted> d0de: im sure you can create a loop for that
[01:06:09] <wa5ted> cors_react: see how the data is being outputted and if you put all the right semi colons
[01:07:42] <d0de> wa5ted, the issue is with iOS permissions, I'm not sure how the work with the API. For example, with HTML5 audio on iOS, if you try to play multiple sounds triggered by one tap, it will only play the first sound. There's not way around this restriction with javascript that I've been able to find
[01:08:08] <d0de> I'm wondering if the web audio API is different, but the apple docs don't make it clear
[01:11:36] <cors_react> the data is visible in this url http://pubapi.cryptsy.com/api.php?method=singlemarketdata&marketid=10
[01:17:58] <cors_react> the only thing i do in my script with it is alert it, and before i get the chance, it stops because it is not reading the json preperly. it shows on firebug that there is a missing semicolon in the middle of the json response
[01:18:48] <cors_react> 	  {"success":1 (this is where the alleged missing semicolon should be) 	 ,"return":{"markets":{"BQC":{"marketid":"10","label":"BQC\...
[01:19:51] <krambiorix> when changing the content of an input field, no event is triggered, only when outoffocus the change event is triggered. How can i trigger when the user is typing in the field?
[01:20:10] <cors_react> onkeyup
[01:21:12] <krambiorix> cors_react, ooow right, thanks!
[01:22:01] <cors_react> you are welcome. could anyone help me with my thing?
[01:22:17] <cors_react> jsonp is a pain
[01:31:34] <HowardwLo> if i want to replace 500 <img> within a <li>, would it be faster with a json or a full <ul> swap ?
[01:32:51] <sahbeewah> cors_react: got some code? don’t see why that would break
[01:33:37] <sahbeewah> HowardwLo: what does doing it with json mean?
[01:33:46] <d0de> if I bind something to an element, then remove() that element and recreate it, will the thing still be bound to the element?
[01:34:18] <cors_react> $.getJSON("http://pubapi.cryptsy.com/api.php?method=singlemarketdata&marketid=10&callback=?", function(result){ //    //response data are now in the result variable //    alert(result);});
[01:34:32] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: json list with img src, and using jQ to create the img tags
[01:34:54] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: vs, swapping the <ul> from the request
[01:38:04] <cors_react> (please ignore the // chars) if i loose the callback=?, it block it as CORS problem
[01:45:50] <sahbeewah> cors_react: i don’t actually know why that is having problems, investigating…
[01:46:45] <mpajor_> I am trying to visualize child/parent-relationships form a horizontal view, instead of vertical. I am however trying to find some type of graphing library (or such) to visualize it nicely for me. Any suggestions?
[01:47:14] <cors_react> sahbeewah, thank you
[01:49:40] <KamalKaur> Is there a way to open a web page in a dialog box, (by giving url of the page to be opened), using JQuery?
[01:51:48] <KamalKaur> I can open a file using .load but how to open a url?
[01:52:30] <cors_react> KamalKaur, you mean like showing a chat box?
[01:54:08] <KamalKaur> cors_react:I just want to open another complete webpage in dialog box and that by giving it's URL.
[01:56:27] <cors_react> for some use cases you can use an iframe
[01:56:40] <mgpl> you might use .dialog() and open an iframe in it with an url you specify
[01:58:12] <faraway> Does anyone know how to change albumLabel of lightbox2 globally without changing its source?
[01:58:30] <KamalKaur> mgpl: cors_react Can you give me a simple example of a button, on click which opens a url like "google.com" ?
[02:04:22] <sahbeewah> cors_react: that endpoint doesn’t support jsonp
[02:04:50] <sahbeewah> it’s just returning json
[02:08:25] <mgpl> KamalKaur: something like http://codepen.io/anon/pen/kAKIp
[02:12:45] <KamalKaur> mgpl: Yes (Y) Can't we close it by clicking that cross?
[02:13:49] <mgpl> i dont know how codepen works, but if you try something like that on your own page, you should be able to get it to work, maybe change some things, check in docs etc
[02:19:25] <KamalKaur> mgpl: Ok, thanks :)
[02:20:06] <mgpl> or just saeach google for it. hundreds of working examples out there ;)
[02:30:20] <bas> Hi, im trying to create a vertical scrolling image slide-in effect, ala parallax. Anyone has a good starting point? I looked at skrollr, scrolly and jquery.isalive, but really dont know where to start.
[02:37:55] <Mement> I have a toolbar on my page that opens a modal (dialog). However, it loads very slow. I think the problem is somewhere with adding all the editors in the modal to edit the text on the page. How can I speed up this proces?
[02:38:29] <Mement> Is there a better way to retrieve information and place it in the modal(/dialogue)?
[02:40:36] <SugaSlide> hiya.. got a jquery ui Q. http://jsbin.com/xizene/1/edit?html,js,output when you drag the items onto the "drag here for new group" box. it gives a prompt, enter a name, and it should append the draggable to that new block.. but it isnt. i tried detach() as well but i cant seem to get it right.
[02:40:43] <SugaSlide> any ideas?
[02:48:39] <lilsammy_> does anyone know if chart.js is supported on IRC anywhere?
[02:55:58] <Snoopal> Mement: do you use jquery dialog therefor?
[03:08:54] <KamalKaur> mgpl: Hey! Check it here: http://serv.devplace.in/~kamal/popup.html It's not working, look for errors in Inspect Element.
[03:14:58] <vinou33> hello everybody. I need some help :). Is there someone who knows where i could find a jquery color picker ?
[03:15:12] <Cork> google?
[03:15:19] <Cork> ?g jquery color picker
[03:15:20] <b-ot> Cork: ColorPicker - jQuery plugin → http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/
[03:16:27] <vinou33> Cork: i agree with you. Nevertheless, there are many color picker. I would like a good one and easy to use (it is just for selecting an hexadecimal variable and put it in a text input.
[03:16:46] <Cork> so test the different ones and pick one you like
[03:17:05] <vinou33> b-ot: this one is good ?
[03:17:05] <b-ot> vinou33: as I see it, yes.
[03:17:22] <vinou33> b-ot: ok thanks. i am going to try it.
[03:17:44] <Cork> ...
[03:17:51] <Cork> vinou33: b-ot is a bot
[03:17:51] <vinou33> Cork: i was here for getting some advices ^^. Not for being sent to google. Thank you b-ot :)
[03:18:12] <Cork> b-ot: are you a bot?
[03:18:12] <b-ot> Cork: my sources say no.
[03:18:20] <Cork> b-ot: you sure?
[03:18:20] <b-ot> Cork: yes.
[03:18:25] <Cork> b-ot: ok
[03:19:04] * Cork saves that conversation in the epic log folder :)
[03:21:56] <SugaSlide> lol :P
[03:22:21] <SugaSlide> some people :(
[03:47:02] <cors_react> sahbeewah thank you. i am using an intermediate service to get the json data an i got it working
[03:56:58] <KamalKaur> cors_react: I've used iframe and JQuery dialog box as mgpl told. Here is the link to the page. I'm getting the error: "TypeError: $(...).html(...).dialog is not a function " and "An unsupported character encoding was declared for the HTML document using a meta tag. The declaration was ignored."
[03:57:07] <KamalKaur> Here's the link to page: http://serv.devplace.in/~kamal/popup.html
[03:59:33] <cors_react> when you have errors from jquery min it is probably because your syntax is wrong or you did not load the scrypts in the right order
[03:59:48] <cors_react> what do you want to happen?
[04:05:31] <cors_react> if you are trying to show a modal. i suggest call it separately then changing the html of the body in it to an iframe, which you should set inside a container
[04:06:06] <cors_react> this is easily done using bootstrap
[04:18:45] <shebbi_> i'm finding now that i have to rewrite my code from $('.foo').on('click', function(){...}); to $(document).on('click', '.foo', function(){...}); in order for things to work. I dont understand. Help needed.
[04:21:17] <decx> read this shebbi_ http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[04:21:41] <shebbi_> decx: can you explain it?
[04:21:50] <decx> the text does
[04:22:25] <KamalKaur> cors_react: Sorry, there was a network problem. I just want to open a url in JQuery dialog box.
[04:23:34] <shebbi_> decx: I find it very hard to understand.
[04:24:24] <decx> you load new .foos in there after load
[04:24:40] <decx> the .foo on click doesnt apply to those because on page load they dont exist
[04:25:00] <decx> with delegation static parent on click .foo it applies the event to the parent
[04:25:16] <decx> to a parent
[04:26:18] <Paradisee> why am i not able to run a js script importing it corretly?
[04:26:24] <Paradisee> <script type='text/javascript' src='../static/system.js'></script>
[04:26:55] <shebbi_> Are you saying if the document elements are all present on page load then use direct events. if not, use delegated events, as it can bind events to elements that do not exist on page load?
[04:27:19] <decx> that's what stands there in the link yes
[04:28:34] <shebbi_> Does using .hide() stop you from binding events? therefore, you cannot use direct event handling?
[04:28:46] <decx> no
[05:39:30] <caraconan> Hi there. There's a way to consolidate this code in just one method? http://paste.debian.net/122362/
[05:40:05] <caraconan> The goal is to dynamically populate the listview on 3 different pages
[05:40:12] <systemfault> Just use a better selector...
[05:40:28] <caraconan> At the moment my only woraround is to set 3 different DOM ids and to repeat the method 3 times (ugly)
[05:41:03] <systemfault> '#foo, #bar, #baz' is a valid selector.
[05:41:08] <caraconan> systemfault: there's a way to specify the 3 selectors at the same time? This did'nt worked:     //$(document).on('vclick', '#options, #options-page-coop-list, #options-page-coop-detail li a', function(){
[05:41:28] <systemfault> It should work.
[05:41:58] <systemfault> '#options li a, #options-page-coop-list li a, #options-page-coop-detail li a' shoudl work
[05:42:19] <caraconan> ok, I'll try both solutions again. Thanks
[05:43:57] <caraconan> systemfault: thanks, 2nd solution worked
[05:50:39] <AdamPDotty> $(#options, #options-page-coop-list, #options-page-coop-detail).on('vclick', 'li a', function(){
[05:50:46] <AdamPDotty> with '
[05:51:03] <AdamPDotty> would probably work, but have the method internally three times
[05:51:09] <AdamPDotty> that is, three event handlers
[05:51:23] <definity> http://pastie.org/9584060 Can any one see why my animate method does not work at the bottom of my page? I'm trying to turn the text red. thanks :)
[05:54:15] <caraconan> AdamPDotty: thanks as well
[05:54:29] <dANO> definity: change your id Home put it on the a
[05:55:00] <Kingsy> I have a string that contains "hello", the string is called parent.. so I am doing this --> currentSelection.push({parent:value}); <-- to attempt to add the parent along with a value as a key value pair to an array.
[05:55:28] <dANO> definity: And try to use alert in your click function . If the alert appears the problem is your animate function
[05:55:29] <Kingsy> the output is a new entry in the array object like this --> parent: "the value"
[05:55:41] <mgpl> definity: you are trying to change color of #div not <a>
[05:55:45] <AdamPDotty> the animate-function itself works
[05:55:47] <Kingsy> wtf? its actually writing the word parent rather than using the variable contents?
[05:56:19] <AdamPDotty> plus <a> inherits color from <div>
[05:56:49] <AdamPDotty> unless a has a CSS-Rule with higher priority
[05:58:12] <Kingsy> wtf.. this is weird..
[05:58:25] <dANO> I have a table with multiple dynamic id , I use the .load function and I want to load the td#id but i dont know how I can write you load all td but the content is the correct content, actually my content after the load is the same in all of my td.
[05:59:09] <dANO> And i want different content in my td. ( I use that for refresh the % of upload file present in my table ).
[06:00:48] <sniperh4x0r> anyone can get this to have a fadein/fadeout effect? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GvDFt
[06:01:03] <sniperh4x0r> i'm reading the documentation on magnific but can't figure out what i put in the callback
[06:02:03] <definity> dANO: mgpl: thanks for the help :)
[06:03:56] <definity> Can i do normal CSS syntax in selectors such as a:hover?
[06:04:48] <BillCriswell> definity: No
[06:05:51] <BillCriswell> definity: What are you trying to do? Might help if you just talk it out a bit.
[06:09:30] <definity> Well I want to make my button change color when clicked or when you hover over it. I know you can do it in CSS but I want to do it in JQuery.
[06:09:51] <definity> I have tried to select the div where the button is inside of but that does not seam to work
[06:10:06] <definity> It was sugested that i target the a tag rather than the div tag
[06:11:43] <Kingsy> how do you join() an array with both keys and values.. I want to join the values only..
[06:11:49] <Kingsy> so I really need to use a loop ?
[06:11:57] <Kingsy> join("") seems to return ""
[06:13:09] <BillCriswell> definity: You can use .hover() ( or mouseenter(), mouseout() ) but you should just use css.
[06:13:35] <fedora_newb> I am trying to select a twitter bootstrap modal header on show.bs.modal. I can console.log $(this) and it shows the modal properties but when I try to do $(this).find('div.modal-header') it never returns the object.
[06:13:35] <BillCriswell> If you want something to happen to a child of a parent on the parents hover you would do something like div:hover a { }
[06:14:24] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: You can use .map
[06:16:05] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: http://jsbin.com/kivemelejuxo/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:17:08] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: Dependong what browser you need to support there's also: Object.keys(someObject);
[06:17:30] <BillCriswell> That would work in IE9+
[06:17:48] <Kingsy> hmm naa it has to be backwards compatible really
[06:18:17] <BillCriswell> The safe route would be $.map then.
[06:21:15] <Kingsy> BillCriswell: hmm I cant get that working with my data.. does it matter than I am declaring the orignal array like currentSelection[parent] = value; ?
[06:21:52] <BillCriswell> No. An object is an object no matter how it's made.
[06:21:58] <Kingsy> hmmm
[06:22:01] <Kingsy> what the hel
[06:22:02] <Kingsy> l
[06:24:02] <BillCriswell> wtf mate
[06:32:42] <Kingsy> ah I have it
[06:32:56] <sniperh4x0r> hey guys i got it working thanks and nevermind my questino'
[06:42:02] <fedora_newb> I have a button where the modal is fetched from the server and then added to an element than .modal('show') is triggered. Now globally I am trying to set a height on the modal-body but when using .on('show.bs.modal' andthen trying to $(this).find('div.modal-header'), it never finds the object but it is there?
[06:42:52] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Do console.log($(this).find('div.modal-header').length); and make sure.
[06:42:55] <BillCriswell> Should return 1.
[06:43:53] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, returns 0 but not sure if the modal-header is there?
[06:43:58] <fedora_newb> why^
[06:44:32] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Do console.log(this) and make sure this is what you think it is.
[06:44:52] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, I have already done that and it is the modal object
[06:46:30] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, and looking through the console.log, the innerHTML shows the modal-header class
[06:46:38] <fedora_newb> on $(this)
[06:46:46] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Can you set up a demo at like http://jsbin.com/ ? They have "Bootstrap" under the "Add library".
[06:49:00] <fedora_newb> Not sure if it would be the same results as I am fetching the modal from the server and adding via .html?
[06:50:29] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, using $('.modal').on('show.bs.modal', function() { I am not even able to find div.modal-dialog which is reported by console.log($(this)) as a child
[06:55:32] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Sorry had a quick meeting.
[06:55:42] <Marchitos91> Helllo! I am trying to understand how a jquery slideshow works. How can a photo go out the border and do not overlap the body?
[06:55:44] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: You would need to bind the modal after the content is loaded.
[06:56:50] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, example?
[06:56:53] <fedora_newb> Please.
[06:59:11] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Define the modal stuff after the ajax is loaded, in the .done()
[07:00:53] <jimi_> Can someone help me identify why this xhtr is being called twice with every search? (sample http://pastie.org/private/dv34ab4wodigklwlibzz6w)
[07:02:24] <jimi_> ah, i thin its because its binding to keyup and change
[07:03:02] <beasty> hi all!
[07:04:05] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: http://jsbin.com/yujexihevusi/3/edit?html,js,output
[07:04:26] <BillCriswell> The setTimeout is there as a poor man's ajax request.
[07:04:53] <beasty> let's say i have a array build like this [{id: "foo1",description: "blahblah"},{id: "foo2", description: "blahblahblah"}] is it possible to check if there is a match in the array for id=foo2 ?
[07:06:26] <BillCriswell> beasty: Loop through and see if it exists, when it does set a variable and break out of the loop.
[07:07:49] <beasty> ok
[07:08:24] <Kingsy> if I have an object like this --> {key1 : "value1", key2 : "value2"}  <-- is it possible to see if the object contains value2 without using the associated key ?
[07:08:51] <Kingsy> like if(obj.hasValue("value2")) {} ?
[07:11:29] <BillCriswell> beasty: If you don't need to support old IE ( IE8 and down ) you can use .some.
[07:12:19] <BillCriswell> beasty: IT would be like... someArray.some(function (el) { return el.id === 3; }); and that would basically do the same as I described with the loop.
[07:13:29] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: It sounds like you're digging a hole.
[07:13:39] <Kingsy> yeah totally agree
[07:13:43] <Kingsy> I have stepped back
[07:13:52] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, other than appendTo, I use html, then in the global.js I use $('.modal').on('show.bs.modal', function () { but I guess the timeout does the trick?
[07:13:54] <Kingsy> I am looking at the data types again
[07:14:41] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: No, the trick is to set the event listener after the element is available.
[07:15:19] <fedora_newb> Right but would the .on fire right after the .modal('show')?
[07:16:15] <fedora_newb> Cause I do the .html(data), then the .modal('show') which should call the .on event?
[07:16:23] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: "This event fires immediately when the show instance method is called. If caused by a click, the clicked element is available as the relatedTarget property of the event."
[07:16:52] <fedora_newb> Right but my method should still work right?
[07:17:00] <fedora_newb> Cause the data is there before I call the show?
[07:17:17] <BillCriswell> I think I'm lost.
[07:17:22] <fedora_newb> lol, sorry
[07:18:37] <sammysam> hello to all
[07:21:21] <sammysam> i want i have created 2 modal  with forms inside in a same page.and they re using the same autocomplete, so i create 2 ids for the different  forms, but the autocomplete works on one form not the other .this is the autocomplete http://chat.developpez.com/upload/54202cfa4e2d9/code.html
[07:21:25] <sammysam> thnx in advance
[07:21:57] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, so a link is pressed, I use a $.get to get the html. I then place that html inside a div with the class modal with .html(data). After that, I call the .modal('show') on that div. Which then my $('.modal').on('show.bs.modal', function () { should be able to access right?
[07:22:21] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:23:08] <fedora_newb> But I can't :/
[07:23:48] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, I see the modal info with console.log($(this)) but I can't access the children with like $(this).find('div.modal-header')
[07:24:24] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: I have no idea unless I can see what you're doing.
[07:35:55] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, this help http://pastebin.com/ZCMP5iYr
[07:37:42] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell http://screencloud.net/v/qXUk is the result of the console.log
[07:39:54] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: What you're doing in the global file you need to do in the .get success.
[07:42:44] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, could I put it in a function and call it, be the same affect?
[07:42:58] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Yes.
[07:43:12] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, thanks for the help, much appreciated. :)
[07:43:21] <BillCriswell> You'll need to call the function in the $.get callback obviously.
[07:43:24] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: No problem.
[07:43:45] <neuromute9> hey folks! I'm trying to animate the right position of a div using 1.11.1 and using "$popup.animate({'right': '30px'}, 120);" it seems to animate opacity, margin, padding as well as right position... what gives?
[07:45:00] <Cork> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/6581292
[07:45:03] <BillCriswell> neuromute9: It sounds like you have something else going on there.
[07:45:41] <BillCriswell> Cork: Hahaha, nice.
[07:45:59] <BillCriswell> neuromute9: Are you adding a class or something in this process and have css animations going on?
[07:46:06] <Cork> BillCriswell: it was kinda epic :D
[07:47:16] <neuromute9> BillCriswell, no, here's the js code... http://jsfiddle.net/4z4u20fx/
[07:48:48] <neuromute9> BillCriswell, this contains the css too http://jsfiddle.net/4z4u20fx/2/
[07:49:17] <BillCriswell> neuromute9: I think you want .show(0, function () { ... });
[07:49:27] <BillCriswell> .show animates all that crap I think.
[07:49:49] <neuromute9> really? weird
[07:50:01] <neuromute9> I'll give it a whirl, see what happens!
[07:50:30] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking because of the callback it animates it? I never used show with a callback.
[07:50:47] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[07:51:04] <ozoness> Hey guys, I'm working on this little form validation function: http://jsfiddle.net/hfbbra37/1/ But I don't think I'm doing it right. I know I could be creating a plugin to make it cleaner, but what actually worries me is performance, specially on the tab higlighting function (toggleTabHighlight) since it's running a couple of closest() and find() t
[07:51:04] <ozoness> oo often. I'm going to use this in a much bigger form so I wanted to know if you maybe have any suggestion. I tried to put the demo as simple as possible...
[07:51:13] <neuromute9> BillCriswell, well, that's fixed it... there's a nice little gotcha!  thanks muchly
[07:51:37] <BillCriswell> neuromute9: No problem. I wouldn't have expected that to happen.
[07:51:53] <BillCriswell> Since just doing .show() doesn't cause that issue.
[07:55:18] <Velveeta> ozoness: one thing you can start by doing is scoping your dom search in getErrors(), either by passing the form to it as a parameter, or calling it with the form as the 'this' scope
[07:55:27] <neuromute9> BillCriswell, life saver, cheers!
[07:56:08] <BillCriswell> neuromute9: It was pretty much a guess haha.
[07:56:08] <Velveeta> also, .closest() searches aren't nearly as bad as .find(), so i wouldn't worry too much about closes, as it just traverses up the heirarchy
[07:56:16] <BillCriswell> Welcome though!
[07:57:15] <ozoness> Velveeta: yeah, I actually put getErrors only for demo purposes, so I didn't even care about performance there
[07:57:22] <Velveeta> gotcha
[07:57:42] <Velveeta> you could also change your $field.on('keyup change') to a delegated function so that it doesn't need to be bound each time you run through the errors
[07:58:06] <Velveeta> just delegate it to something like: $form.on('keyup change', '.has-error', function () {})
[08:01:42] <ozoness> Velveeta: hmmm that'd be really nice, but is it any way I could delegate it to '.has-error' if I'm listening for events in a '.has-error' children (input)?
[08:04:09] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, http://pastebin.com/MUQGv46a
[08:04:12] <ozoness> Velveeta: the thing with $field.on('keyup change') is it doesn't make sense to go and try to highlight the tab each time I press a key... but I didn't know how to handle that...
[08:04:32] <fedora_newb> console.log is still showing 0 for modal-header :/
[08:04:50] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha
[08:06:22] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: I would need to see it in action. Just use jsbin and make it almost work.
[08:08:06] <cubud> Can anyone recommend a blog/article on how to show a list of objects on a webpage and allow inline editing + creation + deletion?
[08:08:25] <cubud> I've googled around but I am getting the impression I need angular JS or something?
[08:09:01] <basiclases> hey guys, can i mimic browser input fields (if not valid URL, search in x search engine) with jquery ?
[08:09:20] <basiclases> the validation is what im not sure about at this point
[08:09:32] <Velveeta_> cubud: you don't ever *need* angular for anything... it makes some tasks easier, for sure, but it's just js, so anything it can do, can be done with something else also
[08:10:02] <Velveeta_> check out todomvc, which has an implementation of a list with add/edit/delete functionality
[08:10:10] <cubud> Velveeta_: I meant to follow the instructions
[08:11:09] <cubud> backbone, I've not heard of that for a long time.
[08:13:50] <basiclases> guys D:
[08:24:41] <bl4ckdu5t> Got this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/neh1jygv/
[08:25:07] <bl4ckdu5t> I don't expect the input to be doubed when UK is selected, then India is selected
[08:25:19] <bl4ckdu5t> I want it to keep the single input
[08:25:31] <bl4ckdu5t> and then change to the select in cases of the USA selection
[08:27:14] <wunz> bl4ckdu5t: not sure i understand what you mean

[08:35:35] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Haha yeah.
[08:35:49] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Do you have more than one modal on the page or something?
[08:36:00] <fedora_newb> Yep, BillCriswell
[08:36:12] <BillCriswell> It could just be targeting the wrong one.
[08:36:31] <fedora_newb> Well, now I am padding the id of the modal to the function
[08:36:33] <decx> if your traversal doesnt find anything any method you apply wont matter Shmias____

[08:38:20] <Shmias____> what does $.find('.foo') return if there is no .foo in the DOM?
[08:38:20] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, what doesn't make sense is when I console.log($(this)) and it shows the modal-header in the innerHTML
[08:38:23] <decx> robertmaxrees didnt kick ban immidiately because he knows the pain
[08:38:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.  often.
[08:38:40] <definity> I orginally tried .animate but that also did not work
[08:38:43] <BillCriswell> Worst c&per ever.
[08:38:44] <decx> Shmias____ it'll be an empty object
[08:38:49] <decx> []
[08:39:06] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Could it just be bad html?
[08:39:10] <Shmias____> decx: like return []?
[08:39:35] <decx> it'll be an empty jquery collection
[08:40:08] <Shmias____> but why doesn't this crash? var foo = $('body').find('.foo'); foo.addClass('bar');
[08:40:27] <decx> shouldnt be related
[08:40:30] <Shmias____> an empty array has no function addClass
[08:40:32] <decx> oh it doesnt crash
[08:40:40] <decx> it's an empty collection
[08:40:46] <decx> it still has all the usual jquery methods
[08:40:51] <decx> just applied 0 times
[08:41:00] <Bloomberg> hello
[08:41:18] <ortund> can someone rell me what this line is doing exactly? $.post($(this).attr("action"), $(this).serialize(), function (data) {
[08:41:36] <ortund> particularly if there's anything I have there that isn't needed for the post
[08:41:40] <decx> posts a form with its default action
[08:41:55] <Bloomberg> what difference there if I do console.log(my_var.text()) and if I set before that var with text property
[08:41:58] <robertmaxrees> with a serialized version of its own data.  use .prop() if you can, ortund
[08:42:12] <Bloomberg> because only works if I show into console with .text()
[08:42:16] <Bloomberg> why?
[08:42:19] <ortund> robertmaxrees, use .prop() where?
[08:42:28] <robertmaxrees> instead of .attr()
[08:43:01] <bl4ckdu5t> decx: hi! can you help me look into this http://jsfiddle.net/neh1jygv/
[08:43:13] <ortund> robertmaxrees, that was a prime example of rtfm before asking lol
[08:43:18] <bl4ckdu5t> select UK and then India
[08:43:31] <fedora_newb> BillCriswell, will look for dupliate ids and what not but not sure....getting a bit frustrated with it though lol
[08:43:40] <ortund> whats .prop() do thats better with serialized data?
[08:43:50] <bl4ckdu5t> see the way double input elements are prepended in the statehold class. I don't want it to be so
[08:43:56] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Understandable. It's a good thing you isolated the issue though.
[08:44:06] <decx> well dont prepend bl4ckdu5t
[08:44:33] <fedora_newb> Thanks for your help BillCriswell
[08:44:40] <robertmaxrees> ortund that has nothing to do with your serialized data.  .prop() access the underlying DOM node, instead of parsing the HTML, which is a little quicke.
[08:44:45] <BillCriswell> No problem at all.
[08:44:58] <bl4ckdu5t> decx: .html() doesn't make .statevar available for me to call back
[08:45:00] <definity> http://pastie.org/9584648 Okay I updated it and the problem seams to be with the event handeler i think.
[08:45:33] <decx> just put that input you prepend in the initial markup and hide it
[08:45:54] <robertmaxrees> definity to animate colors you need to include jquery ui as well.
[08:45:54] <BillCriswell> decx: When you click on #home chances are youwe're clicking on the <a> as well which is probably making things jump.
[08:46:01] <bl4ckdu5t> ok decx thaks
[08:46:05] <robertmaxrees> or another plugin.
[08:46:08] <bl4ckdu5t> *thanks
[08:46:21] <decx> i didnt click on shit BillCriswell wut
[08:46:29] <BillCriswell> definity: ^^^^^
[08:46:36] <BillCriswell> decx: OH YOU CLICKED ON IT
[08:46:42] <decx> i did :(
[08:48:22] <definity> Oh I see thanks, so how do i go about selecting specific a tags?
[08:49:15] <BillCriswell> decx: You can do like... #home a.
[08:49:27] <robertmaxrees> lol definity you mean, BillCriswell?
[08:49:36] <BillCriswell> Why the fuck do I keep doing that.
[08:49:42] <decx> i've had it with these motherfucking tab completes on this motherfucking channel

[08:51:20] <fedora_newb> :)
[08:51:22] <decx> oh you do your own traversal function Shmias____

[08:51:42] <BillCriswell> definity: No problem.
[08:51:47] <BillCriswell> fedora_newb: Good stuff.
[08:52:02] <fedora_newb> Again, thanks for your help today
[08:52:24] <robertmaxrees> ortund there's nothing unusual about that.
[08:52:33] <robertmaxrees> that's expected behavior.
[08:52:49] <ortund> robertmaxrees, this is code given to me by a friend so wasn't sure if it was needed or not

[09:00:53] <decx> you want to return each.function( in your getWhatLinksHere

[09:01:52] <decx> well maybe not, i never did a traversal function ^^
[09:02:12] <Shmias____> decx: but it should do it already for every hit
[09:03:28] <decx> this in the function is the complete collection, obviously doesnt matter with ids but when you have a big collection it does matter
[09:04:31] <definity> http://pastie.org/9584699 After trying what you said I still get no effect from the animation.
[09:04:48] <definity> BillCriswell:
[09:04:51] <definity> ^^^
[09:04:57] <robertmaxrees> definity can you set up a jsfiddle with what you're doing?
[09:05:05] <robertmaxrees> so we can show you a working example?
[09:05:33] <BillCriswell> definity: It's the click event that's causing the issue, not what you're trying to animate.
[09:05:46] <BillCriswell> Also, what robertmaxrees would help everyone out a lot.
[09:06:00] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like there are two issues going on atm.
[09:06:06] <robertmaxrees> that's why I ask :)
[09:06:13] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I'll give you an issue!
[09:06:18] <robertmaxrees> D:

[09:07:57] <ozoness> Hey guys! do you think you can give me a and with this? https://forum.jquery.com/topic/form-validation-function-performance-issues
[09:08:00] <Shmias____> okay, won't happen in my project
[09:08:56] <robertmaxrees> ozoness you're saying you're worried about performance - do you have any tests that corroborate your worries?
[09:09:38] <definity> robertmaxrees: Okay
[09:09:41] <robertmaxrees> also, you're bidning an event listener within an event listener - that's a big no-no.
[09:15:21] <definity> Here is a Jfidle of what im trying to do
[09:15:29] <ozoness> robertmaxrees: mmm I don't have any test, the thing is I'm running multiple DOM queries each time I submit the form. In the example it's only a couple of fields but if I take that to a bigger form I'm checking on every single input if it has a closest tab, then looking for that tab, then checking if it contains any errors, then append the error...
[09:15:29] <ozoness> and also it's probable that I'm running that over and over on the same fields, so I was thinking in some way to cache that maybe...
[09:15:36] <definity> http://jsfiddle.net/uho0g50g/
[09:15:53] <robertmaxrees> ozoness you're prematurely optimizing.
[09:16:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd start by worrying about things like var $field = $form.find('[name="' + field + '"]'),
[09:17:16] <robertmaxrees> select on classes/IDs since attribute selectors are slow.  Also, cache things like var $form = $('#form') outside of your event handler.
[09:17:24] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i wouldn't worry until you see an issue.
[09:19:03] <ozoness> robertmaxrees: nice, that's helpful, I'll do that. And what about bidning an event listener within an event listener? What's wrong with that?
[09:19:19] <robertmaxrees> ozoness it's redundant.  they stack.
[09:19:48] <robertmaxrees> and can create instances where you think you're firing a listener once, but instead you're throwing it 20 times.,
[09:20:09] <ozoness> robertmaxrees: I was caching $form inside my event handler because my form has dynamic inputs, so I need to re-cache it each time to get the updated form
[09:20:19] <robertmaxrees> ozoness not like that.
[09:20:40] <robertmaxrees> cache the form outside - the form element isn't changing.  re-run the selectors inside the handler if you need to.
[09:23:50] <ozoness> robertmaxrees: ahhh nice, gotcha... I'm not quite sure about my $field.on('keyup change') inside of $('button').on('click'), I can't imagune any other place to put that... but I'll research on it
[09:25:14] <robertmaxrees> bind it outside of the click handler.
[09:25:23] <robertmaxrees> and ditch the .each().
[09:25:43] <robertmaxrees> in fact, if you used some delegated listeners for these, you'd simplify things a lot.
[09:26:16] <definity> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/uho0g50g/
[09:27:41] <robertmaxrees> definity btw http://jsfiddle.net/uho0g50g/3/
[09:27:58] <robertmaxrees> there's a dropdown in the upper left to load in jquery.  just fyi :)
[09:28:38] <definity> oh cool thanks :)
[09:28:49] <robertmaxrees> definity okay, so I click on the #Buttons div and then you try to animate the color of a link.  don't think that's what you want.
[09:28:53] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish here?
[09:31:25] <ozoness> robertmaxrees: that sounds nice, but I'm not that advanced in jquery... :D
[09:31:44] <robertmaxrees> ozoness $('parent').on('event'
[09:31:47] <robertmaxrees> woops one sec.

[09:34:31] <raul782> Hi, I'm trying to upload directly to S3 from a preview generated in the browser
[09:34:35] <raul782> is it possible?
[09:34:50] <robertmaxrees> raul782 that's not a jquery question.
[09:35:15] <raul782> I'm using jquery file upload
[09:35:23] <definity> robertmaxrees: Okay i want it so when you click #Home it goes red
[09:35:49] <robertmaxrees> raul782 great - that's still not really a jquery question :)
[09:36:34] <robertmaxrees> definity http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uho0g50g/5/
[09:36:58] <fission6> anyone have any recommendations to tighten up the little bit of jQuery/js on this page non-ascii.com

[09:39:53] <decx> that's the strangest current category implementation i've seen this week
[09:40:07] <robertmaxrees> and it's only Monday.
[09:40:07] <decx> red color all the things !
[09:40:10] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:40:15] <robertmaxrees> (one step at a time yo.
[09:40:34] <decx> well i've done wordpress already today soooo
[09:41:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uho0g50g/7/ this is closer to what he's lookin' for.
[09:41:26] <robertmaxrees> and bummer.
[09:45:44] <ozoness> robertmaxrees: thanks for the example, here´s what I've done: http://jsfiddle.net/r09a3m2v/1/ You said "ditch the each" (line 38)... What do you suggest instead?
[09:50:14] <robertmaxrees> oh I see, you're using that to get context info.
[09:50:27] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were using that just to bind that listener.
[09:51:47] <robertmaxrees> you should also check out binding to the form submit event instead of to the submit button clock.
[09:55:19] <ozoness> robertmaxrees: ohhh nice, nice I'll do that. thanks a lot man, I really appreciate your help
[09:58:51] <fedora_newb> http://pastebin.com/SDC4EqRa can someone explain to me how the variable email is out of scope?
[10:06:50] <robertmaxrees> fedora_newb it's in scope - it gets hoisted to the top of that function like this - http://fixee.org/paste/k6mytmu/
[10:09:28] <jesselang> I'm having trouble using dynamically loaded drop-down menus with IE 8. Works in FF and Chrome. IE 8 is supposed to be A-grade according to http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/1.4/
[10:10:17] <chriscalip> quick question does jquery have an equivalent function like https://gist.github.com/benkitzelman/5372419  saferead?
[10:10:27] <chriscalip> A safe format function to read deeply nested properties
[10:10:55] <systemfault> Nope
[10:11:03] <chriscalip> joy
[10:13:44] <jesselang> Does anyone have an idea why jQuery Mobile isn't working with IE 8 for dynamically loading drop-down menus?
[10:14:52] <Prometheian> I can't tell you for sure jesselang, but the devs where I work have been tearing out their hair making jQuery mobile play nice with IE 7/8.
[10:15:06] <Prometheian> If you can avoid it, I'd say do so.
[10:15:52] <chriscalip> ahh IE giving people grief since 90's
[10:16:38] <robertmaxrees> *old IE ;) you'd gripe if you still had to support old versions of chrome.
[10:16:55] <Prometheian> But Chrome auto-updates! The users don't have a choice, thank god.
[10:17:10] <jesselang> Prometheian, believe me, I would like to. The site launches next week and my boss tells me today that it needs to support IE 7/8. I'd be laughing my head off if it wasn't my project.
[10:17:37] <robertmaxrees> aye, and starting with 11 MS set it to auto-update by default, as well.
[10:18:12] <Prometheian> Your boss is an idiot. You can try out css3 pie for some of the issues.
[10:18:39] <BillCriswell> Bring me a pie of love.
[10:18:44] <robertmaxrees> what sort of data do they have to back that decision?
[10:18:46] <jesselang> Prometheian, it won't load the content from my AJAX source into the drop-down menu, apparently.
[10:18:47] <robertmaxrees> i'd hate to see those metrics.
[10:19:20] <Prometheian> I know you can turn off some jQuery Mobile thing to allow elements on the page to be clickable.
[10:20:00] <Prometheian> But I can't find the line in the codebase I've got here.
[10:20:16] <Prometheian> Currently having issues w/ CSS3Pie giving me buttons of different sizes. T.T
[10:22:11] <Prometheian> Oh, and mousing over SOME of the urls on the page causes one of the buttons to go invisible. Like wtf.
[10:31:28] <Velveeta> sorry, had to disappear into an hour and a half meeting earlier, but it looks like ozoness got sorted out via robertmaxrees
[10:31:37] <robertmaxrees> si senor.
[10:33:50] <hlvwrk> .trim doesn't trim the beginning of a string, right?
[10:33:55] <hlvwrk> Only the end.. right?
[10:34:19] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.trim/ - http://i.imgur.com/NkHePqC.png
[10:34:23] <robertmaxrees> beginning and end.
[10:34:28] <hlvwrk> Ah.
[10:34:29] <hlvwrk> interesting
[10:34:30] <hlvwrk> thanks
[10:37:48] <Velveeta> it'll also typecast null and undefined for you
[10:38:13] <robertmaxrees> even though null and undefined are trying to get into more diverse roles.  $.trim() is very rude.
[10:38:38] <robertmaxrees> :D
[10:38:44] <Velveeta> it's true, nobody wants to be pidgeonholed into a string position for the rest of their career
[10:44:58] <tcon> hey, so for some reason I can't reference "$" in my code, I get an undefined error. But if I reference "jQuery" it works -- why is that?
[10:45:24] <Velveeta> sounds like something else is overwriting your $ reference
[10:45:45] <Velveeta> wrap your code in an IIFE and explicitly pass in jQuery as a reference and receive it as $
[10:45:51] <robertmaxrees> or it's in noConflict mode.
[10:45:55] <Velveeta> (function ($) { // your code here }(jQuery));
[10:47:09] <tcon> hmm wrapped it in an IIFE and it's still returning undefined
[10:47:09] <Cork> undefined sounds like noConflict or jquery isn't loaded yet
[10:47:32] <robertmaxrees> your code is loaded after jquery, right?
[10:47:41] <Cork> tcon: check so you don't get a 404 or 500 error from loading jquery.js / jquery.min.js
[10:48:07] <tcon> robertmaxrees yeah my Gruntfile concats it all together but jQuery is the first thing
[10:48:29] <tcon> Cork loading it from google CDN, haven't had an issue until today :\ seems jQuery is loading fin
[10:48:31] <tcon> *fine
[10:48:49] <Velveeta> you're concating it from google cdn?
[10:49:20] <tcon> Velveeta oh hmm, right -- I had forgotten I had a local copy too lol
[10:49:35] <tcon> they're probably conflicting with one another?
[10:49:43] <Cork> no
[10:49:50] <Cork> you wouldn't get undefined from that
[10:49:51] <Velveeta> also, a good practice is to concat your libs in one bundle file, and your application code in another
[10:49:51] <Prometheian> This is a shot in the dark but: I've got a button styled using CSS3Pie so it renders not-like-crap in IE7/8. However this button will go invisible when either two of the four links in its section are hovered over, and become visible when the either of the other two links are hovered over. Has anyone experienced something similar and/or found a solution?
[10:50:13] <Velveeta> because your application code is gonna change more often than your libs do as you push releases, so you make better use of the browser cache for that lib bundle
[10:50:40] <tcon> @Velveeta good call, going to restructure my grunt concats right now
[10:50:55] <Cork> Prometheian: all those solutions build around quite horrible hacks
[10:51:06] <Cork> Prometheian: and yes, they all get problems like that
[10:51:26] <Prometheian> Damn. Well hopefully I can find a fix or my boss gives it a pass.
[10:51:41] <Velveeta> what kind of button styling are you using that requires css3pie?
[10:51:55] <Prometheian> Rounded edges.
[10:52:01] <Velveeta> that's exactly what i figured :D
[10:52:04] <Cork> Prometheian: one solution builds around duplicating the element and adding them in small chunks to create the rounding
[10:52:14] <Cork> Prometheian: and one uses vml
[10:52:15] <Velveeta> yeah, you should convince your boss to let graceful degradation take its course
[10:52:20] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[10:52:23] <robertmaxrees> this all day every day.
[10:52:30] <Cork> both need to fiddle with z-order and positioning
[10:52:42] <Cork> and that is often what causes the rendering problems
[10:52:53] <Cork> Velveeta++
[10:53:04] <Velveeta> it doesn't impact the user experience at all for one browser to display rounded corners and another to display squared corners... that kind of mentality is a holdover from the olden days of the net when you had to have a consistent appearance across all browsers
[10:53:13] <Prometheian> The buttons generally appear fine, it's just this single one that goes invisible if you mouseover a thing.
[10:53:23] <Velveeta> and there's a lot of overhead in trying to maintain that sort of thing
[10:53:27] <Prometheian> No other buttons (there are several on the page) have this issue.
[10:54:09] <Cork> Prometheian: you could try fiddling with zoom, position: relative
[10:54:16] <Cork> it MIGHT get you going again
[10:54:32] <Cork> but ya, it is fragile to use those
[10:54:41] <Prometheian> I'll give it a shot, ty!
[10:54:51] <Velveeta> i'd still try floating the idea to your boss (even if you do get this issue resolved) that you should let things gracefully degrade where they're not supported
[10:55:00] <Velveeta> if he buys it, it'll put a wedge in that door
[10:55:13] <robertmaxrees> and try to understand why you're supporting back to IE7.
[10:55:15] <Velveeta> and when other issues inevitably bite you in the ass, you have precedent
[10:55:22] <Cork> ya, cause this makes the site slow in older ie too
[10:55:31] <Cork> so bad all around
[10:55:52] <Prometheian> Oh no, we have a number of clients on IE7/8, and apparently one on 6. I can't just bail out on it, sadly.
[10:56:06] <Cork> ie6...
[10:56:09] <Velveeta> plus, solutions like that typically require your code to have knowledge of its browser, as opposed to its features, and browser detection vs feature detection is a bad idea these days
[10:56:10] <Prometheian> Yup
[10:56:11] <Cork> JIKES
[10:56:15] <Prometheian> Yup....
[10:56:38] <Prometheian> Velvetta: The about of <!--[if lt IE 9]> I've done recently is appaling.
[10:56:43] <Velveeta> yeah, if you have to support those browsers for your client base, sometimes there's no way around that
[10:56:47] <Prometheian> appalling*
[10:56:57] <Cork> ya
[10:56:57] <Velveeta> however, wherever possible, i'd definitely push for letting things gracefully degrade
[10:57:07] <Velveeta> as long as there's no actual impact to the user experience itself in doing so
[10:57:18] <Velveeta> which, in the case of something like rounded corners, there isn't
[10:57:19] <Cork> but ya <!--[]> is a lot better then the hacks used before it was figured out
[10:57:24] <Velveeta> yepyep
[10:57:44] <Cork> ie7.js anyone? :D
[10:57:45] <Velveeta> compared to most hacks out there, <!--[]> is a relatively clean solution to be honest
[10:57:49] * Cork shivers
[10:57:52] <Velveeta> heheheh
[10:58:08] <robertmaxrees> it really is - it's Microsoft's apology to web devs.
[10:58:24] <robertmaxrees> "we know we did wrong - here's one fix :( "
[10:58:29] <Cork> robertmaxrees: except it created a lot of really weird dom traversal bugs
[10:58:43] <robertmaxrees> sure, but meh.
[10:58:49] <Cork> (as comments had to become dom elements)
[10:59:07] <Prometheian> Imo Microsoft should just release all the exploits in <IE9 and say if you want to stay on it, go ahead. Fuck you.
[10:59:32] <Velveeta> and the modern-day microsoft: "we know we still have lots of issues, but we're gonna pretend like we've already overcome them and go ahead and remove support for conditional includes"
[10:59:42] <Cork> Prometheian: well xp is fast getting into a state where you REALLY shouldn't use it
[10:59:57] <Velveeta> it's already out of support, so that alone should say you don't wanna use it
[10:59:57] <Cork> Prometheian: and soon the shit will hit the fan
[11:00:03] <Cork> and it SHOULD kill ie6
[11:00:07] <Prometheian> Looking forward to it.
[11:00:19] <Cork> Velveeta: true, i thought so too
[11:00:35] <Cork> then i looked around in support channels/forums/mailinlists and so on
[11:00:47] <Cork> xp is still in surprising popularity
[11:00:55] <Cork> "it still gets updates"
[11:01:04] <Cork> ... no that is "security esentials"
[11:01:06] <jesselang> Prometheian, looks like it was old crusty browser syndrome, not actually jQuery Mobile failing.
[11:01:33] <jesselang> Reserved keywords like "for" and "class" had to be quoted in object constructions.
[11:01:49] <Velveeta> cork: i remember reading soon after the EOL deadline that the irs was paying some 7-figure sum to MS to continue providing them support while they transitioned their systems
[11:02:01] <Velveeta> because apparently MS just sprung this shit on the world with no notice whatsoever
[11:02:07] <Cork> Velveeta: sure, some companies get xp updates
[11:02:09] <Velveeta> except for the years of notice and pushed back deadlines...
[11:02:23] <Cork> for things like like atm embeded machines
[11:02:30] <definity> If you have selected a tag already and you are with in the event. that means if i use self that invoking the parent right?
[11:02:35] <Cork> but consumer computers don't
[11:02:38] <Velveeta> right
[11:02:40] <Cork> and those are the ones i talked about
[11:02:59] <Cork> sadly ms decided to still ship the malware updates
[11:03:02] <Velveeta> definity: self doesn't exist as a variable in the event handler, unless you define it
[11:03:06] <Cork> and ppl see those as security fixes
[11:03:12] <Velveeta> if you're talking about 'this', it will be the element you bound your event listener to
[11:03:17] <Cork> and as a verification that xp is still maintained...
[11:03:35] <definity> Valveeta: How do I do that
[11:03:41] <Velveeta> definity: how do you do what?
[11:03:47] <Prometheian> jesselang: Glad you got it fixed. Also, word of warning, if you have a trailing comma in an array, anywhere, IE7 will flip its shit.
[11:03:59] <Velveeta> cork: i remember being so excited at the XP launch event... now i just wish it would die already :D
[11:04:07] <BillCriswell> It'll flip its shit right up into your face.
[11:04:17] <Cork> definity: $('span').on('click', function() { $(this).hide() })
[11:04:18] <jesselang> Prometheian, I'm downloading an IE 7 VM right now to try it out.
[11:04:28] <Prometheian> Good idea, I use the same one. :P
[11:04:40] <Cork> Velveeta: i've never been excited about xp
[11:04:42] <definity> Cork: Thanks :)
[11:04:46] <Cork> Velveeta: i liked 2k much more
[11:04:54] <^^x^^> time to work. Hasta luego
[11:04:59] <Velveeta> i used to love 2k also
[11:05:44] <Cork> 2k was before they mixed in all the weird 9x code into the nt kernel
[11:08:39] <Cork> Prometheian: ya, that is an old ie "feature", its been doing that since ie4
[11:09:19] <Prometheian> Ofc you wanted a null array object at the end!
[11:09:37] <Prometheian> I am but a young'n, never had to web dev for anything lower then IE7. ^^
[11:09:43] <Cork> the other engines just drop the trailing comma
[11:09:58] <Cork> Prometheian: be glad
[11:10:04] <Prometheian> Oh, I am!
[11:10:20] <Cork> i had to create a site with dropdown menus in ie 5.5 a few years bacl
[11:10:22] <Cork> *back
[11:10:37] <Cork> note ie 5.5 doesn't support hover and click on none <a> elements
[11:10:56] <drej> like 10 years back you mean?
[11:10:57] <Cork> and it doesn't support position elements without a table
[11:11:04] <Cork> drej: 2008
[11:12:00] <Prometheian> I'd say I'd love to only support the latest stuff, but this latest version of Chrome altered script load order and broke half the pages in this app.
[11:12:16] <Cork> drej: it was the last project i let my self getting pushed to support absurdly old browsers
[11:12:29] <drej> yeah thats insane
[11:12:36] <Cork> (but we have one user a month with this version, it must be supported"
[11:12:38] <robertmaxrees> also last I checked chrome has a long-standing history popstate bug that was a terrific pain in the ass to fix.
[11:12:54] <Cork> drej: at first i had to support ie4
[11:13:11] <Cork> but we had to drop it cause the site simply couldn't be generated in ie4
[11:13:22] <drej> thats just dumb
[11:13:53] <Velveeta> how recently did you have to support ie4?
[11:14:00] <Cork> Velveeta: 2008
[11:14:04] <Velveeta> holy shit
[11:14:20] <Cork> Velveeta: the next project i set a hard limit for ie7 :)
[11:14:27] * Velveeta hands Cork a time machine and a large trout to go smack his former management around with.
[11:14:28] <Cork> my boss went bananas :D
[11:14:42] <Robdgreat> Cork: I had to support ie6 for a project in 2010
[11:14:44] <Cork> and ie7 was only in legacy mode
[11:14:52] <Cork> (no rounded anything)
[11:15:13] <Cork> Robdgreat: ouch
[11:15:22] <Velveeta> damn, have a meeting in 15 minutes, better hurry and finish up some other work, afk
[11:15:35] <Robdgreat> Cork: yeah, to this day I curse Alaska Air
[11:16:23] <Cork> Robdgreat: i had a cousin that used ie5.5 until 2010.
[11:16:29] <Robdgreat> wtf
[11:16:37] <Cork> "no need to upgrade as sites has to support it"
[11:16:40] <Cork> made me cry
[11:16:52] <Robdgreat> no they don't
[11:16:54] <Robdgreat> f that
[11:16:54] <Cork> haven't asked him what he uses now days
[11:17:04] <Cork> ie6 i guess
[11:17:20] <Robdgreat> must be frustrating to surf the web on his 486
[11:17:34] <Cork> my sisters boyfriend to be precise
[11:17:56] <Robdgreat> ok, ok, maybe it's a p2
[11:17:58] <Cork> Robdgreat: was a fairly modern machine
[11:18:12] <Robdgreat> Cork: then how is it that it had 5.5 installed on it?
[11:18:13] <Cork> he still installed win2k back at 2010 though >_>
[11:18:19] <Robdgreat> sigh
[11:18:24] <Robdgreat> I hate him already
[11:18:27] <Cork> lol
[11:19:17] <Cork> we was the admin in the citys it department
[11:19:34] <Cork> and they rand win2k for as long as it was supported (and a little more)
[11:20:27] <tcon> turns out it was a wordpress plugin causing $ to become undefined
[11:20:31] <tcon> *angry fist shake*
[11:20:34] <Cork> made talks a bit strange with him on one end and me having to deal with shit caused by his lack of interest to keep up with development on the other end ^^'
[11:22:41] <cookiebow> I i have a heavy page, and i'm using document ready at top, is there any easy way to show a div (loading icon) until 'document ready' has finnished? Or have i missunderstod the purpose of doc ready?
[11:23:00] <cookiebow> In an easy way
[11:23:10] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[11:23:23] <Robdgreat> cookiebow: if you had it load with the page and hide it in document ready it should accomplish what you describe
[11:24:01] <drej> Cork: if it makes you feel any better
[11:24:14] <Robdgreat> (it won't)
[11:24:16] <Robdgreat> ;)
[11:24:20] <drej> the first site i did for a client i started when netscape 1 was out, and then netscape 2 came out and broke half the site a week before launch
[11:24:40] <Cork> drej: been there, done that :)
[11:24:50] <drej> of course, browser distribution wasnt exactly what it is today, so it took a while for anyone to get on nn2
[11:25:21] <Cork> ya, and the useragent hacks to get tables working >_>
[11:26:42] <Cork> there are some parts of html from back then i would have really liked to have changed
[11:29:21] <Cork> cookiebow: best option is prob to move the dom ready code to onload
[11:29:32] <Cork> cookiebow: dom ready is triggered before the page is drawn
[11:29:43] <Cork> and it will block drawing the page (with a timeout)
[11:29:58] <Cork> cookiebow: so no, you can't draw anything before dom ready
[11:30:30] <Cork> cookiebow: alternatively move the code into the end of body, then you would get the same behavior (as onload)
[11:30:47] <robertmaxrees> probably want something more like $(window).on('load', function() {}); cookiebow
[11:31:23] <robertmaxrees> or change things up so you don't have to do this in the first place.
[11:31:30] <Cork> true
[11:31:58] <cookiebow> thanks
[11:32:01] <Cork> ex. you could delay code that doesn't have to run on load
[11:32:08] <BillCriswell> XSLT is such a head ache.
[11:32:14] <Cork> so and run it with a postMessage or similar
[11:32:22] <Cork> so it runs slightly later
[11:32:34] <Cork> BillCriswell: ppl still use that?
[11:32:44] <robertmaxrees> xslt is neat stuff.
[11:32:46] <robertmaxrees> funky, but neat.
[11:33:27] <robertmaxrees> publish XML from your backend, let the browser run an XSLT on it on the frontent.  bam.
[11:33:46] <Cork> true
[11:34:00] <robertmaxrees> *frontend.  the WoW site ran like that for a while.
[11:34:08] <Cork> though it feels like css should have been able to do it
[11:34:24] <Cork> instead of spliting it into its own standard
[11:34:45] <Cork> it is what modern html is MEANT to be anyway
[11:34:57] <robertmaxrees> XSLT is about transforming data from one format to another - it has its place.
[11:35:48] <Cork> ya, sure i just meant i think css should have been able to fit for it
[11:35:53] <robertmaxrees> not imo.
[11:36:20] <robertmaxrees> xslt - transform this data into this markup. css - here's some info about how my markup should look.
[11:36:22] <Cork> and by fit i meant, with modifications btw
[11:37:17] <Cork> well xml is markup too
[11:37:54] <robertmaxrees> sure.  doesn't change my point, but we're not going to agree no matter what and I'd rather not derail the room for longer :)
[11:37:58] <Cork> though sure, you often have things not in the xml you want to add
[11:38:04] <Cork> and that doesn't belong in css
[11:38:22] <Cork> robertmaxrees: i don't really disagree
[11:39:17] <Cork> basically i would have liked the web to be more display and data separated then it normally is
[11:39:20] <Cork> that's all
[12:11:08] <lessergeek> greetings jquery admins
[12:12:39] <lessergeek> can someone please advise who are top admins for jquery that can answer questions from the news media? thanks
[12:13:01] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:13:15] <robertmaxrees> "top admins from jquery"? you mean like, the people in charge of jquery?
[12:13:16] <lessergeek> or just have them pm me? thanx
[12:13:23] <lessergeek> yeah those people
[12:13:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jquery.org/team/
[12:14:26] <lessergeek> thanks but that's not terribly helpful in the context of IRC handles
[12:14:44] <robertmaxrees> lessergeek also, check out #jquery-dev.
[12:14:50] <robertmaxrees> that channel is where they might hang out.
[12:14:54] <lessergeek> thank you
[12:15:22] <robertmaxrees> but contacting people via irc for "news media" purposes is a little strange - you'll probably have better luck with email.
[12:21:34] <Bloomberg> is ok this :: if(isNaN($(".fieldTx:last td").eq(3).text())){$(".fieldTx:last td").eq(3).text(0)}
[12:21:48] <Bloomberg> because doesn't works
[12:22:50] <robertmaxrees> Bloomberg what are you trying to do?
[12:24:04] <Bloomberg> What happen is if the input is empty the operation show me in each one another input NaN
[12:24:32] <robertmaxrees> then test if the input is empty?
[12:24:59] <Bloomberg> alreadybut nothing+
[12:25:13] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle demonstrating what you're trying to do?
[12:25:20] <Bloomberg> ok
[12:31:37] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/yawoqecopove/1/edit
[12:31:43] <Bloomberg> but here doesn't works
[12:34:35] <robertmaxrees> because validarNro isn't defined.
[12:35:14] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/yawoqecopove/1/edit
[12:35:20] <Bloomberg> now have validarNro
[12:35:28] <Bloomberg> but anyway doesn't works
[12:35:28] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[12:35:36] <robertmaxrees> look at your console dude.
[12:35:43] <robertmaxrees> economic.eq(...).children(...).val(...) is undefined
[12:35:57] <robertmaxrees> what line in here is broken?
[12:36:14] <robertmaxrees> ah the last one.
[12:37:05] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN this is of interest btw.
[12:37:33] <robertmaxrees> to test if it's empty, either check its length or if it's .val() === ''
[13:09:17] <Paradisee> why am i not able to check if a file exists on the server or not? http://dpaste.com/1F01PCE
[13:09:33] <Paradisee> 127.0.0.1 - - [22/Sep/2014 22:05:39] "HEAD /static/config.json HTTP/1.1" 200 -
[13:09:50] <Paradisee> this is the response that i get when i check for it, but the alert says Page not found.
[13:15:11] <robertmaxrees> the error callback can be hit if the returned data is invalid.
[13:18:26] <Paradisee> i'm actually using flask/python to manage the request of each page
[13:18:46] <Paradisee> and i have a 404 page also, could it be the problem?
[13:19:27] <Paradisee> it is not..just tried
[13:21:51] <robertmaxrees> the body of the response is what's important.  also try dropping the type from the request unless you really think you need it.
[13:23:13] <Paradisee> how can i show the response
[13:24:55] <robertmaxrees> copy/paste it into a fixee?
[13:26:26] <Paradisee> fixee?
[13:27:46] <robertmaxrees> fixee.org
[13:28:58] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: probably you missunderstand my question
[13:29:11] <robertmaxrees> oh you want to look at the response from the server?
[13:29:13] <Paradisee> im not able to log the response
[13:29:17] <robertmaxrees> which browser are you using?
[13:29:22] <Paradisee> chromium
[13:29:47] <robertmaxrees> go to thew dev tools, click "network" and reload the page.
[13:29:53] <robertmaxrees> then click the response in that tab.
[13:30:02] <Paradisee> got it probably
[13:30:13] <Paradisee> yep, that's where i was
[13:30:53] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/2YH4T4H
[13:31:03] <robertmaxrees> the contents of the response yo.
[13:31:21] <robertmaxrees> click the "response" tab.
[13:31:39] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/3N1ETXM
[13:31:48] <Paradisee> there's no contents
[13:32:04] <robertmaxrees> so it's an empty file?
[13:32:08] <robertmaxrees> becuase that'll cause it to error.
[13:32:13] <robertmaxrees> needs to at least be {}
[13:32:42] <Paradisee> still nothing
[13:32:53] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it in action, it's hard to help.
[13:33:36] <Paradisee> do you have team viewer?
[13:33:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:33:51] <robertmaxrees> and i wouldn't have time to do a remote thing anyway ;)
[13:34:59] <Paradisee> what can i do?
[13:35:31] <Paradisee> it shouldn't have data for a response btw
[13:35:41] <robertmaxrees> that'll cause it to error then.
[13:35:58] <Paradisee> im just checking if a file exists on the server
[13:36:27] <robertmaxrees> the .json file extension is making juqery try to download and parse the file.
[13:36:38] <Paradisee> lets try to rename it
[13:36:49] <robertmaxrees> change it to .txt and see fi that works.
[13:37:07] <Paradisee> it works
[13:37:26] <robertmaxrees> cool, also try to use .fail() and .done() instead of success and error
[13:38:02] <Paradisee> what's that for
[13:38:37] <robertmaxrees> .fail() and .done() are the more modern callbacks - they rely on the internal deferreds system which is a better way to do things in general.
[13:41:13] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/gtbdcwg/
[13:41:17] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[13:41:22] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/1BN8Y2M
[13:41:42] <Paradisee> ya
[13:42:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.  and get in the habit of not using alert() - use console.log() - much easier.
[13:42:47] <Paradisee> but i need to get the json file :/
[13:42:51] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:43:04] <robertmaxrees> you said you just need to know if it exists.  do you need to action against it once you have it?
[13:43:12] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: ya
[13:43:26] <robertmaxrees> then drop the type option from the ajax call.
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> and make sure you're returning valid JSON.
[13:44:01] <shoky> or use  dataType: 'text'    if you don't want it to parse any json
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> the headers need to be right on the server-side, btw.
[13:44:05] <Paradisee> works
[13:44:17] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/gtbdcwg/#url=pd0ty3n
[13:44:26] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch
[13:44:32] <Paradisee> thanks
[13:44:53] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: i suggest you to do not use tabs :D
[13:45:13] <Paradisee> tabs are bad if not made as spaces
[14:35:33] <sadtaco> http://bellbros.com/ What's a good plugin to do stuff similar to this?  With the parralax and scroll based transitions.  Preferably something that uses css3 transitions where available and stuff.
[14:37:39] <sadtaco> http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/ ah this one looks good
[14:44:30] <hancock> How can I achieve a scrolling-effect like this: http://promo.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html ?
[14:44:38] <hancock> It scrolls sections at a time
[14:49:58] <definity> Why is this not working? http://pastie.org/9585977
[14:50:37] <robertmaxrees> bad selector or you don't have jquery ui included.
[14:52:56] <robertmaxrees> any console errors, definity?
[14:57:10] <systemfault> I don't think you can animate color with just jQuery
[14:57:31] <robertmaxrees> hence the jquery ui comment :)
[14:57:50] <systemfault> Ah, right!
[14:58:48] <definity> robertmaxrees: Nope
[14:59:12] <definity> What do you mean by JQuery ui?
[14:59:14] <Woet> definity: provide a working demo on www.jsfiddle.net
[14:59:21] <Woet> oh, alright, that probably solves that.
[14:59:23] <robertmaxrees> definity you need to include jQuery ui to animate color
[14:59:25] <Woet> answers *
[14:59:25] <definity> User Interface?
[14:59:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryui.com/
[14:59:49] <definity> Ah I see a diffrent Lib. Okay thanks guys :)!!
[15:00:08] <robertmaxrees> there are plugins out there to do just colors btw.
[15:00:16] <robertmaxrees> so you don't have to do the whole lib if you don't want.
[15:15:58] <decx> i now like .animate()
[15:16:01] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/jqn31p8x/
[16:15:57] <litropy> $( ".myclass:nth-of-type(2)" ) will get me the second <div class="myclass">, correct?\
[16:17:37] <robertmaxrees> sure should
[16:17:45] <robertmaxrees> you also have $('.myclass').eq(1)
[16:21:18] <litropy> Yep that did it. Hm ... robertmaxrees - I see that. Do you (or anyone) happen to know which method is less resource-intensive?
[16:21:30] <robertmaxrees> totally depends on the use case :)
[16:22:42] <robertmaxrees> nth-of-type() will run great if the browser supports it. the latter is really awesome if you already have that selector cached somewhere.
[16:25:40] <litropy> Oh, wow. It's a CSS3 selector. Nice.
[16:25:55] <litropy> Good support as well.
[16:26:41] <litropy> robertmaxrees, what happens when the browser doesn't support it? jQuery does its own selection in the CSS3 selector's place?
[16:27:13] <robertmaxrees> litropy yep.  jquery tries to find it for ou.
[16:27:17] <robertmaxrees> *you the best it can.
[16:27:18] <litropy> I see.
[16:28:43] <litropy> robertmaxrees, once I select, the selector is cached into RAM? If I $(".myclass"), will $('.myclass').eq(1) run faster?
[16:29:15] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:29:25] <robertmaxrees> var $myClass = $('.myClass');
[16:29:39] <robertmaxrees> now if you use $myClass, that's faster.
[16:30:01] <robertmaxrees> because it doesn't have to re-run the selector OR create another object.
[16:30:21] <litropy> robertmaxrees, I see. And just to make sure, that $ in $myClass is cosmetic, right?
[16:30:50] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:31:20] <litropy> Thx for taking the time to give good info, robertmaxrees :-)
[16:31:40] <robertmaxrees> of course.
[19:55:15] <jaccob> browsers automatically cache? Like if you visit the home page, and then an about page, with both of them serving jquery, does the browser bother to download twice or does it cache it after the first page?
[19:58:36] <__joshua__> jaccob: the response headers determine an expiry
[19:59:11] <__joshua__> if using chrome or ff you can see the caching in the network tab in the developer tools
[19:59:46] <jaccob> __joshua__, thx
[20:04:37] <mshadle> any jquery (and possibly CSS) hackers available for 2 small design/plugin questions? probably simple for anyone who has used fancybox. or a sticky footer.
[20:06:24] <mshadle> i cannot for the life of me figure out why the same thing works on one page and not the other :/
[20:13:00] <__joshua__> make a jsfiddle
[20:13:02] <__joshua__> or similar
[20:18:33] <mshadle> __joshua__: i can send the URL i am working with. i'll paypal someone a few bucks for a fix :p
[21:09:47] <scrubfest> I have different sections in my site, and want to underline in my navigation where I am currently at, suggestions?
[21:11:12] <scrubfest> I should say I have gone with raw coding atm. just underlining according to y-value. But I'd like to tie it to <section id="id"> if possible
[21:23:15] <scrubfest> Nothin?
[21:40:09] <scriptThis> So, in general, should jquery.js come before or after your own .js file in the <head> ?
[21:48:34] <tw2113> before your own if you're wanting to use jQuery in your custom one
