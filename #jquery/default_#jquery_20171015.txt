[04:12:09] <V7> Hey all ;)
[04:12:55] <V7> Does anyonse here know anything about datatables ?
[04:13:10] <V7> I.e. how to close all child rows ?
[04:23:17] <V7> Okay ...
[04:26:01] <V7> This https://paste.ee/p/btfKo doesn't work
[04:26:15] <V7> Tables are generated like this: https://jsfiddle.net/8m1Lfdh4/4/
[04:26:28] <V7> So ... it just doesn't close them ...
[04:26:51] <V7> I guess that something wrong with selection because thisone is binding in cycle ..
[04:39:01] <V7> I've asked this one on their forum yesterday, but they ingoring me ... uh
[05:07:41] <anli> Is it possible to send ajax calls when the document whole document is navigating?
[05:07:55] <anli> (before it has been navigated to the new page)
[05:27:00] <jak2000> hi all
[05:27:12] <jak2000> wich plugin for graphs recommend me?
[05:32:30] <jak2000> hi
[11:54:10] <DukeDrake> hi
[11:57:30] <DukeDrake> I'm trying this: $("#container").on("click", "li", .... but apparently this only works for every immediate descendant li ,  not for li ul li  .. ??
[12:00:25] <DukeDrake> I can't get it to work for more than one layer
[12:11:07] <jphase> DukeDrake: $("#container li").on("click", function(){ // stuff }); should suffice
[12:11:24] <jphase> if you want to grab all li's that are a child of #container that is
[12:14:56] <DukeDrake> jphase: I'm actually just trying that ... or rather: I found my problem, which is in the bubbling
[12:15:27] <DukeDrake> the innermost event get's overwritten by the next outer event ....
[12:16:40] <DukeDrake> ok, adding "return false" fixed it
[12:17:12] <jphase> DukeDrake: you may want to look into .stopPropagation() as well
[12:17:18] <jphase> but glad you figured it out
[12:31:53] <DukeDrake> thanx =)
[13:33:54] <jak2000> hi all

[19:57:23] <V7> Do .on events are left after object's removal ?
[19:59:05] <V7> jak2000: chart.js ?
[20:24:09] <definitelynotjq> Is there a way of binding to each existing ajax request in my script instead of manually going now and adding code to each one?
[20:31:29] <definitelynotjq> Found it myself, in case anyone else is curious $(document).ajaxStart(function() { ... } and ajaxStop
