[00:06:56] <coj> anyone know a library for creating custom checkboxes (e.g. toggleable divs)? i'm going to try to code it but thought i'd check here first. bonus points if it's easy to insert more checkboxes e.g. via a dropdown.
[00:09:37] <ravenzz> coj what browsers do you want to support?
[00:10:04] <coj> ie >7, ff, chrome, safari
[00:10:10] <coj> pretty much everything i guess
[00:10:28] <coj> ravenzz: someone is telling me CSS alone works for chrome
[00:11:02] <ravenzz> it does
[00:11:22] <ravenzz> actually you can do it in CSS if you don't care about ie7/8
[00:11:54] <ravenzz> because IE7/8 don't have support for the :checked status
[00:12:01] <ravenzz> but you can polyfill it with js
[00:12:02] <ravenzz> later
[00:12:12] <coj> they don't? i've been using jquery's is(:checked)
[00:12:50] <ravenzz> that's javascript :)
[00:12:57] <ravenzz> I am talking about CSS
[00:14:43] <coj> oh, okay. if i do pure CSS using the :checked pseudoclass, will that work for both FF and Chrome?
[00:14:53] <ravenzz> yes
[00:15:44] <coj> thanks ravenzz!
[01:08:59] <ak5> hi guys, I want to get an array of all values which are value attrs of input fields. I tried something like this: times = $('input').each()attr('value').toArray();
[01:10:36] <ak5> the problem is that attr only gets the attribute of the first matched element, is there a good way around this?
[01:16:34] <boulet101010_> ak5: wait i write something for u
[01:16:53] <coj> ak5: you need to add all the properties to the same array
[01:17:05] <ak5> coj: correct
[01:17:19] <ak5> I just want all value="" values
[01:17:23] <ak5> in an array
[01:17:51] <coj> go read how each() works i guess
[01:18:17] <Heather_> question: if i have an array and I want to push a value to a specific elemtn I do $array_name[0].push(value) ?
[01:20:03] <boulet101010_> ak5: http://jsfiddle.net/LPM7m/
[01:20:11] <boulet101010_> say me if it's correct
[01:20:22] <boulet101010_> whut Heather_ ???
[01:20:36] <boulet101010_> if the elements are array yes
[01:20:57] <Heather_> element as in array element not html
[01:21:05] <boulet101010_> to use "push" you need $array_name[0] to be an array
[01:21:12] <boulet101010_> ok so it may be ok
[01:26:37] <MeMReS> I'm thinking about using .load() to load a form into div when the user hits submit is there a way to target the div so the page doesn't refresh?
[01:29:31] <Cork> MeMReS: its not about targeting div
[01:29:46] <Cork> MeMReS: you need to listen for the submit event and prevent it
[01:30:09] <ak5> boulet101010_: I show you how I solved it after reading each()
[01:30:11] <Cork> if you're doing .load on a form submit that is
[01:30:12] <ak5> http://jsfiddle.net/LPM7m/1/
[01:30:23] <ak5> coj: thanks
[01:30:42] <coj> glad you foud a solution
[01:30:51] <Cork> uh.. a push in a map??
[01:30:51] <ak5> coj: is my solution total crap?
[01:31:01] <ak5> no that was boulet101010_
[01:31:09] <ak5> mine is after "I did"
[01:31:19] <coj> looks fine
[01:31:25] <Cork> why not just do var array = []; $.map($("input"), function(i, v) { return v.value; }); ?
[01:31:27] <ak5> kk ty
[01:31:43] <ak5> Cork: cause I can't read that yet :D
[01:31:59] <Cork> can't read it?
[01:32:01] <coj> map is elegant
[01:32:05] <ak5> sure
[01:32:09] <seutje> ?mlu
[01:32:09] <bot-t> much like urself
[01:32:13] <Cork> ya but the first example in there uses map all wrong
[01:32:41] <coj> it should just return the value, right?
[01:32:44] <coj> instead of pushing
[01:32:52] <Cork> well yes and no
[01:32:59] <Cork> but the way map is used that you can't use return
[01:33:05] <Cork> you need to use $.map not $().map
[01:33:13] <coj> i see
[01:33:28] <Cork> $().map wraps what you return in jquery objects
[01:33:35] <Cork> $.map doesn't
[01:34:24] <MeMReS> jQuery Form Plugin :D
[01:34:57] <coj> i see. made a note
[01:41:27] <boulet101010_> ak5: thanks ;)
[01:42:56] <boulet101010_> Cork: can you explain why the callback return goes into the array?
[01:43:21] <Cork> ?jquery.map
[01:43:21] <bot-t> jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[01:43:27] <Cork> thats why
[01:43:38] <Cork> compared to
[01:43:40] <Cork> ?.map
[01:43:41] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[01:43:45] <Cork> and see ?.each
[01:43:46] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[01:44:27] <Denyerec-OnSite> Is this the kind of channel where one is hounded out for asking about jQueryUI ?
[01:44:34] <boulet101010_> ok but how does it work without specifying where to redirect $.map's output?
[01:44:39] <Cork> Denyerec-OnSite: no
[01:44:40] <Denyerec-OnSite> Got an issue with Tabs, and can't figure the solution out from the documentation.
[01:44:58] <Denyerec-OnSite> Sample Code here:  http://pastebin.com/cdeCiAUg
[01:45:03] <Cork> boulet101010_: $.map returns the newly generated array
[01:45:07] <Denyerec-OnSite> Trying to initialise tabs, AND set a show handler.
[01:45:12] <Denyerec-OnSite> Can't get them both to work :/
[01:45:19] <boulet101010_> ok, so you don't need to declare it like you did no?
[01:45:23] <Denyerec-OnSite> (The code above shows the two things I'm trying to achieve separately)
[01:45:41] <Cork> boulet101010_: yes you do, how would you else get the data?
[01:46:54] <boulet101010_> what i don't understand i how $.map understands that it's in array var where it returns the value.
[01:47:02] <boulet101010_> ewww
[01:47:16] <boulet101010_> no i still don't get it.
[01:47:33] <boulet101010_> array = []; $.map(...) is the right?
[01:48:27] <w00tner> i have a image inside a tab. and i dragged out . but when i change the tab the picture disapears... is there anyway to prevent this ?
[01:49:40] <boulet101010_> ok, there was an error in your callback Cork , it should have been : return i.value
[01:50:38] <boulet101010_> 10:31 < Cork> why not just do var array = []; $.map($("input"), function(i, v) { return v.value; }); ?var array = []; $.map($("input"), function(i, v) { return v.value; });
[01:50:49] <boulet101010_> should have been : var array = $.map($("input"), function(i, v) {return i.value; });
[01:53:01] <coj> if i need to implement that i'll read the $.map documentation
[01:54:28] <boulet101010_> Cork: i didn't understand it because of the "array = []; $.map" that made no sense to me ^^ noprob though i got it ;)
[01:54:47] <Cork> var array = []; creates the variable array
[01:54:59] <Cork> array = $.map(); sets values to it
[01:55:16] <Cork> but sure var array = $.map(); would work too
[02:00:20] <Denyerec-OnSite> http://pastebin.com/xAMKqeqL
[02:00:32] <Denyerec-OnSite> Can anyone offer any advice as to why the bind to the tabsshow there doesn't work?
[02:00:41] <Denyerec-OnSite> I replaced the inner code with a console.log() and it's not triggered.
[02:03:57] <Ortund> can anyone have a look at the slider at http://cornerstone.netgendns.co.za/ and help me figure out why the right edge is moving?
[02:06:39] <Cork> Orphis: without looking at the code i suspect margin collapse
[02:07:02] <Ortund> Cork was that for me?
[02:07:02] <Orphis> I totally agree
[02:07:20] <Cork> so check what changes the animation does to display, padding, margin and border
[02:07:44] <Cork> sorry overflow not display
[02:08:10] <Cork> make sure that the outer element have a border or padding that keeps whats inside it from leaking
[02:08:19] <Cork> overflow: hidden, might be another way to do it
[02:11:17] <oal> Any idea why when running .each on this selector, I only get "[<td>, context: <td>]"? (http://hastebin.com/dinufakabi.js)
[02:11:33] <oal> And not regular jquery objects
[02:11:52] <Denyerec-OnSite> Cork I don't suppose you can offer any insight into that tabs issue?
[02:12:40] <Cork> oal: use this
[02:13:24] <oal> Cork: ah, that works. Thanks!
[02:13:24] <Ortund> Cork, setting no change when I add overflow:hidden to the div surrounding the ul, but setting it on the ul breaks it worse
[02:13:26] <Cork> oal: but no that shouldn't happen
[02:13:55] <Cork> Denyerec-OnSite: sorry no i don't think so
[02:14:03] <Denyerec-OnSite> This is unfortunate.
[02:14:15] <Denyerec-OnSite> The internet documentation is not very helpful in this situation.
[02:14:20] <Denyerec-OnSite> None of the examples appear to work :/
[02:14:43] <Cork> Denyerec-OnSite: i'm quite restricted on right now so i can't dig too much for answers
[02:14:52] <Denyerec-OnSite> No problem
[02:15:34] <oal> Cork: well, didn't work that well. this.children() gives an error, and $(this).children() gives "[prevObject: p.fn.p.init[1], context: <td>, selector: ".children()"]" Does that make any sense to you?
[02:20:02] <ben13> hi guys
[02:20:25] <ben13> i'm creating a tagging system.  in my model (model1) it creates a row of documents by calling another model (model2). ive created a jquery script in modal1 which sets the tag(img) on n off in each row of the document. is there a way i can retrieve the document id from the documents using jquery n updating the documents wth the tags. hope u cn help or point me in the right way
[02:24:03] <Heather_> question: I've declared a multidimensional array and a variable like this : var array = [ [] ]; var variable = 0; when I want to push to a specific element in the array it works when I do array[0].push() but not array[variable].push(). Can anyone explain why?
[02:25:03] <boulet101010_> check if array[variable] exists
[02:26:35] <Heather_> hmm well array is a multidimensional and variable is an integer. And it works with array[0] so it should work with variable instead of 0? Since variable is equal 0 ?
[02:29:16] <BinaryKitten> Heather_ make sure variable is the right value
[02:29:45] <BinaryKitten> also, i'm hoping this goes without saying, but try to avoid variable names like "array" and "variable"
[02:30:44] <ben13> how do i paste a snippet of codes so that i can ask questions?
[02:30:52] <xec> ?p
[02:30:53] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:32:47] <ben13> can someone help with this http://jsfiddle.net/fg9FH/   tq
[02:33:03] <Ortund> I can't find anything in my code that explains why the right edge of my slider at http://cornerstone.netgendns.co.za/ is moving around when it animates
[02:33:45] <xec> ben13: put your text in comments, the *rendered* (no asp/php etc) html in the html field and only js in the javascript field
[02:34:10] <ben13> ok
[02:34:16] <xec> ben13: also, choose jquery from the framework dropdown
[02:34:57] <xec> that way we can see  and play with the runnable version
[02:35:15] <ben13> i dnt hv the full codes with me.
[02:40:10] <ben13> xec can you check this http://jsbin.com/iquyeg/1
[02:43:57] <xec> ben13: no. i can't parse asp code in my head ;) to get the rendered html just do view source in your browser and copy from there
[02:49:48] <chakkimatti> hello all
[02:52:28] <ben13> i have table rows of data that is generated from one module. is there a way i can retrive the data of the row using jquery? each row has <tr class="flag">  n in the main page i do something like $('.flag').click(function(){ (this).attr('src',swap) function swap(){swap the image}  })'     --- how do i get the data from the row?
[02:53:00] <NodeX> define "the data" ?
[02:53:12] <chakkimatti> I'm having trouble passing form data through jquery post method. I need to have something like $('#search').change(function() {$.post('search', {county: $('#county').value...
[02:53:25] <ben13> like documentid
[02:53:34] <NodeX> what is documentid?
[02:54:07] <NodeX> chakkimatti : try $("#county").val();
[02:54:17] <chakkimatti> ah
[02:54:28] <NodeX> value is DOM not jquery
[02:54:43] <ben13> it basically value i get from the model so it would be like <td> <%: html.displayfor(m => m.id) %> </td>
[02:54:52] <NodeX> if you want to use "value" do $(element)[0].value;
[02:54:53] <chakkimatti> NodeX: Yeah :D
[02:55:20] <NodeX> ben13 : I dunno what that is sorry
[02:55:36] <BinaryKitten> NodeX ewwwww
[02:55:46] <BinaryKitten> $(element)[0].value; ==== ultra bad
[02:55:53] <BinaryKitten> element.value = good
[02:56:04] <BinaryKitten> no point wrapping and unwrapping that
[02:56:18] <ben13> Nodex what if its something like this <td> apple </td>
[02:56:27] <ben13> could i get that value ?
[02:57:19] <chakkimatti> $('td') ?
[02:57:22] <NodeX> wth?
[02:57:23] <BinaryKitten> that's not a value
[02:57:28] <BinaryKitten> that's text
[02:57:41] <ben13> could i retrive tht text?
[02:57:45] <NodeX> "element" wasan example selector LOL
[02:57:48] <NodeX> omg
[02:57:52] <NodeX> was an *
[02:57:59] <BinaryKitten> ?.text @ ben13
[02:58:00] <bot-t> ben13, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[02:58:26] <chakkimatti> what what whaat??? I'm in love <3
[02:58:35] <chakkimatti> a bot that talks API <3
[02:59:21] <BinaryKitten> NodeX .. ah that's why i try to use names and quotes like $('selector')[0].value  so it makes sense and doesn't trigger the misconception
[02:59:40] <BinaryKitten> but nvm
[02:59:50] <chakkimatti> works!
[03:00:01] <chakkimatti> Thanks a million NodeX
[03:00:09] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/rrB5U/#
[03:00:23] <NodeX> element.value does not work ;)
[03:00:31] <NodeX> that's a misconception in itself ;)
[03:00:34] <chakkimatti> too many languages/libraries. Must.. Use.. Syntax!
[03:00:42] <Ortund> can anyone have a look at the slider at http://cornerstone.netgendns.co.za/ and help me figure out why the right edge is moving when it animates?
[03:00:52] <xec> NodeX: e in that case is not an element, it's a jq object
[03:00:58] <NodeX> xec I know
[03:01:06] <NodeX> 10:55:45] <BinaryKitten> element.value = good
[03:01:11] <NodeX> that's my point
[03:01:13] <BinaryKitten> NodeX if the element is an item that has a value then yes it does. Which is the case
[03:01:17] <ben13> thnks guys tc
[03:01:21] <xec> yes. element.value is correct, and is good
[03:01:27] <xec> BinaryKitten is right
[03:01:30] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/rrB5U/#
[03:01:35] <NodeX> and wrong at the same itme
[03:01:36] <NodeX> time*
[03:01:50] <NodeX> element.value = undefined
[03:01:52] <xec> no, you seem to be misunderstanding on purpose
[03:01:58] <NodeX> element.val() = bar
[03:02:05] <NodeX> on purpose?
[03:02:06] <BinaryKitten> element is not an element
[03:02:13] <BinaryKitten> that's just the name of the variable
[03:02:22] <NodeX> eh?
[03:02:28] <BinaryKitten> i'm talking about element in the sense of a domElement an actual element
[03:02:29] <NodeX> [10:55:37] <BinaryKitten> $(element)[0].value; ==== ultra bad
[03:02:29] <NodeX> [10:55:45] <BinaryKitten> element.value = good
[03:02:46] <NodeX> and you assumed I meant "element" was a jquery object
[03:02:57] <BinaryKitten> if you have an element and wrap it in jQuery, then use [0] to unwrap it again. that is pointless waste
[03:02:57] <NodeX> which means you thought it was which means that element.value is wrong
[03:03:03] <xec> if you have an element with a value property, you do element.value NOT $(element).val() or the even worse $(element)[0].value
[03:03:09] <BinaryKitten> no i assumed you meant element was an element
[03:03:15] <BinaryKitten> not a jq obejct
[03:03:18] <NodeX> exactly
[03:03:22] <NodeX> err
[03:03:30] <NodeX> [10:55:37] <BinaryKitten> $(element)[0].value; ==== ultra bad
[03:03:34] <BinaryKitten> yep
[03:03:35] <NodeX> would not be ultra BAD
[03:03:38] <NodeX> it would plain NOT work
[03:03:39] <xec> yes
[03:03:43] <BinaryKitten> oh ffs
[03:03:45] <xec> jesus christ
[03:03:49] <BinaryKitten> stop. being. a. DICK
[03:03:52] <xec> NodeX: shut up
[03:03:54] <xec> :P
[03:03:56] <NodeX> wth
[03:04:10] <NodeX> so you get proven wrong and resort to name calling?
[03:04:22] <xec> successful troll is successful i guess
[03:04:29] <NodeX> in your rush to prove me wrong you have made a mistake
[03:04:33] <NodeX> it's not a problem
[03:04:37] <BinaryKitten> with the assumption that element was/is a domElement, then $(element)[0].value ==== ultra bad
[03:05:37] <BinaryKitten> that clearer and more concise now?
[03:05:58] <NodeX> without being a "dick" why would "element" be a dom elment in a JQUERY channel ?
[03:06:24] <BinaryKitten> because " this " in every event is a native domElement
[03:06:37] <NodeX> lol
[03:06:46] <BinaryKitten> (unless you proxy it and fiddle with the calling procedure)
[03:06:49] <xec> also, because it definitely does not make sense to wrap it if it was already a jq object
[03:07:02] <BinaryKitten> also jQuery = JS and jQuery wraps domElements
[03:07:10] <NodeX> semantics
[03:07:23] <xec> if element == $("selector") then you basically did $($("selector"))
[03:07:29] <NodeX> we both know I was talking a jquery object not a dom element
[03:07:39] <BinaryKitten> NodeX actually i didn't
[03:07:55] <xec> NodeX: now stop being silly, this is going nowhere
[03:07:59] <BinaryKitten> if i did know then i wouldn't have spent the best part of the last 15 minutes talking on it
[03:08:05] <NodeX> xec : what's up your ass?
[03:08:29] <NodeX> yesterday you take it upon your self to try tearing me a new one, now today you're the same?
[03:08:49] <xec> NodeX: because you always misbehave
[03:08:58] <BinaryKitten> NodeX if multiple people have the same reaction to you, it may be time to look not at those people as having the problem
[03:09:02] <NodeX> misbehave?
[03:09:10] <NodeX> BinaryKitten : please dont talk to me
[03:09:39] <BinaryKitten> lol
[03:09:46] <xec> NodeX: assuming that something named "element" is actually an element makes sense, and replying with "LOL omg" is just stupid
[03:09:54] <NodeX> xec : 2 days I have had 2 conversations, once you helped and got nerd rage because I asked someone to stop giving me the wrong answer
[03:10:16] <NodeX> and today ytou jump into a conversation that's nothing to do with you and tell me again
[03:10:27] <NodeX> you*
[03:10:36] <BinaryKitten> xec.. ^5
[03:10:54] <xec> NodeX: you were outrageously bad at specifying what you needed, and when given a wrong answer, instead of elaborating you just yell at the people trying to help you
[03:10:58] <BinaryKitten> thank you for having my back and understanding what i was getting at
[03:11:02] <NodeX> a simple misunderstanding / BAD assumption it seems
[03:11:17] <NodeX> I didn't yell I asked him 4 times to stop trying to help because he didn't understand what I asked
[03:11:32] <xec> NodeX: didn't look like it to me, or the person you were yelling at
[03:11:38] <NodeX> to which you came in and helped, end of story
[03:12:28] <NodeX> looks can be decieving as we have just learnt ;)
[03:12:33] * BinaryKitten likes a good bedtime story
[03:14:04] <xec> NodeX: i apologize for any namecalling, i was out of line earlier. just... next time please try to give (more) relevant info rather than trying to win some argument
[03:14:18] <NodeX> I wasn't trying to win some argument
[03:14:38] <NodeX> BinaryKitten : said (misleading) that $(element)[0].value is bad
[03:14:49] <NodeX> which it is if "element" is a jquery object
[03:14:55] <xec> stop the discussion, it's not going anywhere
[03:14:56] <BinaryKitten> or a domElement
[03:15:01] <NodeX> and that's misleading to the person asking the question
[03:15:09] <xec> if element was a jq object you would do element.val() :P
[03:15:20] <NodeX> omg
[03:15:27] <NodeX> you're again missing the point
[03:15:40] <NodeX> the point is the person who asked the question is now confused as hell
[03:15:57] <BinaryKitten> no, you missed mine. and continue to do so. And this continues to be a pointless waste of time
[03:15:57] <xec> yes, mainly because of your arguing. now stop it please.
[03:16:04] <NodeX> because someone took iut upon themselves to point out (with a wrong assumption) that I was wrong
[03:16:33] <BinaryKitten> NodeX if i wanted to point out you were wrong i would have stated "NodeX you're wrong .. blah blah"
[03:16:44] <BinaryKitten> i was making a general statement based upon the information at hand.
[03:16:46] <NodeX> cool story]
[03:16:54] <NodeX> yes at hand - my point
[03:17:04] <NodeX> a bad assumption has started this
[03:17:39] <hazamonzo> Hey folks. Been reading a lot recently but need some advise. Im just trying to make a div fade from one colour to another (then fade back) when a hover event is triggered. There seems to be loads of ways to do this. Whats the best way for such a simple interaction?
[03:18:11] <BinaryKitten> hazamonzo what are you making use of? jquery or jquery UI?
[03:18:27] <hazamonzo> BinaryKitten: It can be either really :)
[03:18:40] <NodeX> Don't use unneccesary bloat ( Jquery UI) unless you really need to
[03:18:56] <reloadz> hi! can enyone help me alert out associated "text" values of my checkboxes
[03:18:57] <reloadz> http://jsfiddle.net/X8AGa/5/
[03:19:16] <reloadz> not "name" atribute
[03:19:26] <ak5> are browser milliseconds real milliseconds?
[03:19:31] <xec> hazamonzo: you can do this with css transitions and :hover
[03:19:35] <BinaryKitten> hazamonzo, as NodeX just stated, unless you need jquery ui in it's entirety you can use a part of it (using custom build) or not use it
[03:19:46] <agnitio> http://jsfiddle.net/agnitio/jYx4v/1/
[03:19:47] <NodeX> reloadz : they're not in an element and cannot be selected
[03:19:58] <BinaryKitten> hazamonzo if you want to use jquery then you should be able to animate the colour (in theory)
[03:20:24] <BinaryKitten> jquery ui gives you ability to animate between classes which would give you a slightly different approach
[03:20:30] <hazamonzo> Okay thats interesting. I've seen many ways to do this but i wasn't sure if there was a simple (selector).something(colour1, colour2)
[03:20:48] <hazamonzo> oh, with transition time too i guess
[03:20:59] <BinaryKitten> ?.animate @ hazamonzo
[03:21:11] * BinaryKitten kicks bot-t
[03:21:19] <xec> hazamonzo: if you want to animate colors with jquery you need the color plugin https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/
[03:22:01] <xec> hazamonzo: but the method really depends on requirements - do you need support for old IE browsers?
[03:22:04] <BinaryKitten> awesome xec
[03:22:05] <reloadz> NodeX: thx! fixed! :)
[03:22:08] <hazamonzo> xec: Appreciated but i think i can do this without another third party plugin :)
[03:22:22] <hazamonzo> hmm, also a good question
[03:22:56] <xec> hazamonzo: it's not really 3rd party. iirc it used to be part of core but taken out because of large size and low usage
[03:23:21] <ak5> I am using the jquery timer plugin, and the ms I get are not equal to ms in the real world. :(
[03:25:49] <agnitio> http://jsfiddle.net/agnitio/jYx4v/1/  - Trying to grab the button data-names, and then checking their respective class attributes to see if they're active
[03:27:49] <NodeX> function(this) { <--- not sure how that would get dealt with
[03:29:16] <xec> i think it'd be the same as ...function () {
[03:31:47] <xec> agnitio: i can't make much sense of your question - is this what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/jYx4v/5/
[03:31:51] <xec> if not - what :D
[03:32:39] <reloadz> how can I uncheck all checkboxes that i have checked (Note: i don't have attribute "checked")
[03:32:42] <reloadz> ?
[03:33:03] <NodeX> $(":checked");
[03:33:19] <NodeX> that will gather them into a collection
[03:33:21] <mandarks> hey guys, got an issue.. need to know how to crawl up the dom to the nearest class reference,
[03:33:28] <mandarks> heres my jsfiddle
[03:33:30] <mandarks> http://jsfiddle.net/puzNU/13/
[03:33:40] <NodeX> $(".bar").closest(".foo");
[03:34:04] <mandarks> will that only go up the dom or will it find those below it also??
[03:34:12] <NodeX> in your case it would be parents()
[03:34:31] <agnitio> xec: Almost - that'll get me on the road. Thank you! :-)
[03:35:20] <xec> reloadz: $('input[type="checkbox"]').prop("checked", false) ?
[03:35:31] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/puzNU/15/
[03:35:36] <NodeX> mandarks ^^
[03:35:51] <xec> reloadz: would select all checkboxes, but unchecking unchecked checkboxes (phew) shouldn't matter...?
[03:36:04] <NodeX> mandarks : things bubble "upwards" toward the top level (body then document)
[03:36:18] <NodeX> find() goes downwards
[03:36:58] <mandarks> awesome, thanks NodeX
[03:37:18] <NodeX> ;)
[03:37:24] <reloadz> xec: thx :)
[03:37:32] <xec> ?closest @ mandarks
[03:37:33] <bot-t> mandarks, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[03:37:33] <NodeX> if you forget just remember that "bubbles" rise
[03:38:03] <xec> mandarks: please ignore NodeX, he's talking about event propagation which has nothing to do with .parents() or .find()
[03:38:37] <NodeX> all thigns bubble upwards
[03:38:53] <NodeX> closest / parents - they all Bubble upwards end of story
[03:38:56] <xec> NodeX: what is a thign?
[03:39:07] <NodeX> like a thing but different
[03:39:11] <xec> :D
[03:39:16] <NodeX> sort of like a pdenatic person
[03:39:20] <NodeX> ;)
[03:39:24] <xec> hehe
[03:39:37] <xec> NodeX: anyway, you're confusing "bubbling" with "traversing"
[03:39:50] <NodeX> I thought (wrongly) that closest would get caught out
[03:40:00] <xec> and everything does not traverse upwards
[03:40:07] <NodeX> traversing is not a nice word, it implies going left and right
[03:40:11] <bencahill> Hey guys, is this right?: If I assign a clone of a jQuery object to a variable, and then run modifiers on it, it doesn't modify the DOM?
[03:40:21] <NodeX> ?closest
[03:40:22] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[03:40:34] <NodeX> "at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree"
[03:40:43] <NodeX> ... up through the dom tree
[03:40:56] <NodeX> ?parents
[03:40:57] <bot-t> .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[03:41:01] <xec> yes. "progressing" works too. "bubbling" is a concept reserved for events
[03:41:34] <NodeX> awesome
[03:41:36] <xec> .parents() will return all matching ancestor elements while .closest() will only return the first match
[03:41:56] <NodeX> but parents goes downwards?
[03:41:58] <NodeX> (no)
[03:42:10] <xec> did i say that?
[03:42:17] <NodeX> [11:39:51] <xec> and everything does not traverse upwards
[03:42:20] <Heather_> question: why am I getting NaN on var variable = 0; variable++; alert(variable);
[03:42:25] <NodeX> yep
[03:42:43] <xec> NodeX. indeed. your statement is completely false, and you proved it yourself by referring to .find()
[03:42:47] <NodeX> [11:38:44] <NodeX> closest / parents - they all Bubble upwards end of story <--- typo - should be "both" not "all"
[03:43:16] <NodeX> and here we are again thru assumptions and typos
[03:43:51] <xec> NodeX: no, i'm trying to clear up some of your confusions that you seem hellbent on spreading to other developers
[03:43:55] <NodeX> I can argue all day long that black is white , always better to remember that when trying to pick my statements apart
[03:45:25] <xec> Heather_: that should work - something else is going on that you're not telling us ;)
[03:45:44] <NodeX> to reprhrase. closest() and parents() both bubble or "traverse" upwards
[03:45:56] <xec> NodeX: not bubble. stop it please.
[03:46:03] <oal> I load a portion of my page (a table) with jquery .load. However, in IE8, the table is squeezed togeter, but I want it to be full width, as in Firefox and Chrome. Suggestions?
[03:46:18] <xec> NodeX: events bubble. not .parents() nor .closest()
[03:46:19] <NodeX> they do bubble, the word is not reserved soley for events
[03:46:29] <xec> NodeX: no
[03:46:31] <alaing> hey ppl, does any one know of a good progress plugin....eg. to show a user where they are in a wizard type interface
[03:46:38] <NodeX> ignored - end of that
[03:46:58] <xec> does that mean i can speak without getting quoted by NodeX all the time?
[03:47:29] <NodeX> to recap - thinhgs bubble, it's a fact of lige
[03:47:31] <NodeX> life *
[03:49:45] <thinkerweb> hi, I tried <strong>some text</strong> for my jquery mobile web page, but it didn't bold the text
[03:51:32] <alaing> thinkerweb: strange do you have valid html?
[03:56:12] <thinkerweb> alaing, hmm, I think it isn't strange, I mentioned jquery MOBILE, did you notice?  I think the styles are set for you
[03:56:41] <thinkerweb> alaing, but it is valid html, like I just copy and paste the template from the site
[03:58:12] <NodeX> maybe <stong> is reset in jquery mobile?
[03:58:16] <NodeX> strong *
[04:01:22] <alaing> try a span with a class and set the font to bold?
[04:01:40] <alaing> thinkerweb:
[04:01:50] <mandarks> wtf did i start ;<
[04:02:21] <thinkerweb> alaing, good idea, thx
[04:02:37] <NodeX> mandarks : don't worry, it's not you
[04:02:51] <NodeX> some people are just argumentative and -have- to prove they're right
[04:03:02] <NodeX> at the cost of confusing everyone else
[04:03:14] <NodeX> but hey at least they win an argument on the internet - cool beans
[04:03:29] <xec> hehe, you seem to be describing yourself, NodeX
[04:03:36] <alaing> thinkerweb: I tend to use that method in case the ydecide to change <strong> like <b>
[04:04:12] <alaing> does any one know of a good progress plugin....eg. to show a user where they are in a wizard type interface
[04:04:21] <mandarks> hey guys, anyone know a way using on click for multiple element
[04:04:53] <NodeX> $('.split, .your, .selectors').click(....);
[04:04:55] <thinkerweb> alaing, jquery ui progress bar?
[04:05:16] <alaing> mandarks: delegate the event at the parent level
[04:05:40] <alaing> thinkerweb: yeah I saw that. I wondered if there was a slicker way
[04:05:45] <alaing> way=one
[04:06:47] <thinkerweb> alaing, thx for your help
[04:06:48] <thinkerweb> g
[04:06:57] <thinkerweb> g'night all
[04:07:20] <shadow_fox> hi i am in a middle of something stupid i know but i couldn't figure it out. here is the code that i want to apply , instead of those divs to slide it just shows without anything. https://gist.github.com/4215022 and in the firebug i am getting the error TypeError: $(...).carouFredsel is not a function. i have queued the jquery file from google cdn , then the carouFredSel javascript file, then in a separate file the code to slide.
[04:08:00] <DukeDrake> hi
[04:08:11] <mandarks> NodeX: you're on fire today, thanks man.. now i can just implode and array of my classes
[04:08:22] <mandarks> *an
[04:09:37] <DukeDrake> is it possible to select all elements that have a class? like $('.') ?
[04:10:08] <NodeX> ;)
[04:10:18] <AL13N_work> can ayone take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/S46Gm/ <-- there's a li.bordermark:after { content: '...'} and it appears below instead after...
[04:10:51] <xec> DukeDrake: $("[class]")
[04:11:10] <NodeX> display: block;
[04:11:13] <NodeX> on the li a
[04:11:20] <NodeX> try inline-block
[04:12:16] <AL13N_work> NodeX: it looks like that works, is that x-browser?
[04:13:17] <AL13N_work> NodeX: is it normal that the after content is still inside the li ?
[04:13:28] <AL13N_work> i figured after would mean it would be AFTER the li ?
[04:14:08] <xec> AL13N_work: both :after and :before are part of the element itself
[04:14:24] <DukeDrake> xec: thanx, excellent =)
[04:14:33] <xec> AL13N_work: but the better solution for you might be to do :after on the <a> instead, like http://jsfiddle.net/S46Gm/1/
[04:15:02] <xec> depending on what you want the "..." to be part of
[04:15:55] <shadow_fox> is that a #javascript room question , i am not aware of that sorry for flooding
[04:16:41] <NodeX> AL13N_work : I think they all support inline-block, best to check though
[04:16:45] <Oddnoun> Hello
[04:16:49] <AL13N_work> xec: well, i just is meant to be a thing in between, not clickable or stuff
[04:17:27] <xec> shadow_fox: no you're in the right place, but it's hard to tell without both knowing what .carouFredSel() is and a live demo
[04:18:17] <xec> ?demo @ shadow_fox
[04:18:17] <bot-t> shadow_fox, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:18:51] <AL13N_work> xec: thanks, i'll keep it in the li then with an extra margin-left so that it apears between the li's
[04:19:42] <NodeX> make sure it doesn't bubble
[04:20:31] <xec> NodeX: why are you so opposed to learning?
[04:20:49] <noregret> can anyone confirm that forum.jquery.com is having trouble ?
[04:20:52] <shadow_fox> got disconnected
[04:20:54] <xec> i tried to tell you something and you take it as an attack on your person
[04:20:57] <noregret> trouble loading *
[04:21:27] <shadow_fox> xec; the home page for that plugin is http://caroufredsel.dev7studios.com
[04:21:57] <seutje> xec: yeah, that's how he landed a permanent spot on my ignore list
[04:22:59] <xec> seutje: i can see why, he's getting on my nerves :(
[04:25:33] <xec> noregret: yeah the forums aren't loading for me either
[04:28:30] <deepsight> hello, im trying  do a "flashing" effect using animate()  on a div with some child, all the child change color as expected but the last one does not, that one has a css metaselector that sets the background color, if i disable the metaselector, it works as expected, is there a way to keep it?
[04:29:21] <deepsight> the metaselector in question is a li:last-child
[04:30:32] <xec> deepsight: you would need to call .animate() on the LIs instead of the div
[04:31:04] <xec> deepsight: it makes sense that a child element with non-transparent background-color will keep its color :)
[04:31:21] <deepsight> all have non transparent background
[04:31:29] <Aamir> any regex guru http://pastie.org/private/k46xzvcpbtg72oy5ef0gsq
[04:31:36] <deepsight> but it is set with normal selectors
[04:31:44] <deepsight> only that one is using metaselectors
[04:32:05] <xec> deepsight: ok, that doesn't make sense.. also, there's no such thing as metaselectors, you mean pseudo-selectors ;)
[04:32:14] <xec> deepsight: do you have a live url?
[04:32:51] <deepsight> nope, internal only...
[04:33:00] <deepsight> local i mean
[04:33:39] <xec> ?p
[04:33:39] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:36:43] <deepsight> xec, i think i got it, it is as you said, i have to select the LIs directly
[04:36:55] <deepsight> thanks
[04:37:04] <BiAiB> hey, where can one find the wikitext sources for the articles of jQuery documentation ?
[04:38:48] <lolek> hello all
[04:39:21] <lolek> is this # ok for asking about plugin writing or should i go to different # ?
[04:39:55] <xec> BiAiB: on the left hand menu at http://docs.jquery.com/ you can click on View Source under Wiki: Actions
[04:40:05] <xec> lolek: here is fine
[04:40:15] <lolek> xec: ok, thx
[04:40:40] <Quest> hi
[04:41:15] <Quest>  I have searched alot but I am unable to find a way to use username password authentication view Internet Explorer (working with firefox). for example http://username:password@website-addres   . ANY work around/solutions ?
[04:42:50] <AL13N_work> if i'm doing a .ajax() call, in the data thing, how can i specify multiple values with the same name?
[04:42:54] <lolek> ok, i've got a question regarding returning values from plugin method for example. let's say that the plugin has got method: http://pastebin.com/LBxPj7CR, and how can i return something in the line: return ... ? (line 7)
[04:43:08] <NodeX> AL13N_work : use []
[04:43:19] <NodeX> foo[]=1&foo[]=2
[04:43:19] <AL13N_work> the name is 'foo[]'
[04:43:40] <AL13N_work> but in .ajax() it's specified as a map
[04:43:52] <AL13N_work> foo[]: bar
[04:45:11] <AL13N_work> NodeX: ah, nvm: "If value is an Array, jQuery serializes multiple values with same key based on the value of the traditional setting (described below)."
[04:45:14] <AL13N_work> thanks
[04:45:15] <BiAiB> xec: thanks, that's what I was looking for. Is their also a list of plugins used / templates installed ? (I want to do my own documentation inspired from jquery docs)
[04:47:10] <lolek> ok, forget that question i've got confused :D
[04:48:39] <ravenzz> ok
[04:49:03] <ravenzz> so you are saying that jQuery datepicker doesn't work on date inputs?
[04:52:14] <Quest>  I have searched alot but I am unable to find a way to use username password authentication view Internet Explorer (working with firefox). for example http://username:password@website-addres   . ANY work around/solutions ?
[05:03:20] <HarryPitfall> Quest, if you're using a ajax request, there is some extra headers that you can use to provide username / password
[05:12:25] <computer2000> im using the html5 boilerplate's conditional comments to get the IE type into the html class, but my IE9 always gets into IE7 document mode ... as soon as i remove the conditional comments, it works in ie9 standard mode ... what am i doing wrong? heres my html http://pastebin.com/ga4Hspz9
[05:13:50] <kiuma> hello
[05:16:47] <R00tk3y> hello
[05:17:11] <R00tk3y> Cp,[iyrt3---
[05:17:11] <R00tk3y> LOL
[05:17:19] <R00tk3y> that was your name computer2000
[05:17:24] <kiuma> I'm using a jqgrid, and I have only one column for which I've defined a formatter, the formatter is used to render a json objet. on cell selection I want to work again with the json object. I've tryed with $("#vdcGrid").getRowData(id) but it returns the html string and not the json object
[05:17:27] <R00tk3y> I missed the keys severely
[05:18:20] <R00tk3y> Kiuma
[05:18:25] <R00tk3y> What does the string look like?
[05:18:42] <kiuma> R00tk3y, html
[05:18:53] <R00tk3y> Okay
[05:18:56] <R00tk3y> Is this the library
[05:18:57] <R00tk3y> http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:methods
[05:18:57] <R00tk3y> ?
[05:19:16] <R00tk3y> "Returns an array with data of the requested id = rowid. The returned array is of type name:value, where the name is a name from colModel and the value from the associated column in that row. It returns an empty array if the rowid can not be found."
[05:19:27] <kiuma> R00tk3y, yep
[05:19:39] <R00tk3y> So looks like it should be JSON if its name:value pair
[05:19:54] <R00tk3y> Kiuma send me it
[05:19:56] <kiuma> mmm....
[05:27:02] <tcberner> good afternoon
[05:28:11] <tcberner> I use jq-datepicker, but unfortunately it wont always show when people use ie9.
[05:28:44] <tcberner> As it is an intranet application IE9 chooses 'Browser Mode: IE9 Compatiblity' and 'Document Mode: IE9 Standards'
[05:28:59] <R00tk3y> IE sucks and should be deleted from the history of the internet
[05:29:03] <boulet101010_> what means "it wont always show" that mean that it sometimes works sometimes no?
[05:29:09] <boulet101010_> +1 R00tk3y
[05:29:35] <tcberner> yes. I can force it to work by calling the developer tools via F12, closing them , and Ctrl+R to reload the page afterwards
[05:29:37] <tcberner> then it works
[05:29:48] <boulet101010_> you may either show us an example, or give us the error message.
[05:29:59] <tcberner> that's the problem, that there isn't one.
[05:29:59] <boulet101010_> whut ?_?
[05:30:08] <boulet101010_> any error in f12?
[05:30:12] <tcberner> nope
[05:30:20] <R00tk3y> I am a webdesigner I spend hours doing my template, all nice with the dropshadows and the glows, and then here comes f**king IE "SORRY SIR, NONE OF THAT HERE, ILL JUST MAKE IT LOOK LIKE SHIT INSTEAD!"
[05:30:38] <R00tk3y> F12 Is developer tools
[05:30:56] <R00tk3y> What doesn't work with developer tools tc?
[05:30:58] <boulet101010_> i meant js console
[05:32:16] <R00tk3y> I want to make a jquery plugin lol
[05:32:23] <tcberner> boulet101010_: yes, I know. There's only the mentioned 'intranet page, so compatibilty mode'
[05:32:24] <R00tk3y> Sounds like fun
[05:33:09] <tcberner> oh wait.. I use 'console.log'
[05:33:27] <tcberner> IE9 does not like it when one does not have F12 opened
[05:35:32] <boulet101010_> exactly
[05:36:27] <tcberner> boulet101010_: I do not like IE ^^
[05:38:12] <arielserafini> it's almost 2013. people are still making IE jokes?
[05:38:14] <arielserafini> :/
[05:38:55] <boulet101010_> arielserafini: exactly, we are happy to joke IE before the new year begins
[05:39:25] <boulet101010_> we don't know if we'll go through this year, so let's have fun with IE shittiness
[05:40:26] <halcyon1234> tcberner: Have you tried some metatag hoodoo to try to force IE to behave? Not sure if Intranet settings override this or not.
[05:40:26] <halcyon1234> <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8; IE=edge;" />
[05:43:21] <AL13N_work> does jquery have some sort of feature list to check which support there is for certain things?
[05:43:31] <AL13N_work> like if input types with date is supported?
[05:46:19] <R00tk3y> How would I compress a jquery file?
[05:46:38] <AL13N_work> get a minified zipped version from the site
[05:46:52] <R00tk3y> https://github.com/jackmoore/autosize
[05:47:23] <AL13N_work> if your apache supports gzip or deflate, then it'll be automatically zipped
[05:47:46] <AL13N_work> minifying existinc .js files is dangerous without testing
[05:48:06] <R00tk3y> Oh great
[05:50:58] <R00tk3y> What if they don't have a minified version?
[05:55:31] <seutje> AL13N_work: u mean like Modernizr?
[06:01:09] <AL13N_work> seutje: that's what i read, but nvm that, i'll do it in another way
[06:01:10] <tcberner> halcyon1234: unfortunately you cannot force it out of the intranet-compat mode
[06:01:16] <AL13N_work> btw: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[06:01:29] <AL13N_work> this is weird, the link to the wiki seems to be gone
[06:01:31] <tcberner> this is a setting which is set by the administrator I guess
[06:01:34] <AL13N_work> how do i get that linke?
[06:01:44] <seutje> AL13N_work: well, jQuery has some basic stuffs in $.support
[06:01:56] <seutje> but most feature checks are out of scope for jQuery though
[06:01:57] <tcberner> ie9compat/ie9 standard is the "best" I can get
[06:02:08] <AL13N_work> For a full list of the possible formats see the [[UI/Datepicker/formatDate|formatDate]] function.
[06:02:15] <AL13N_work> how do i get to the correct page?
[06:03:14] <AL13N_work> nvm: found it here: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/formatDate
[06:04:01] <seutje> bah, you beat my google-fu

[06:39:42] <pythonholum> has a specific class, I have an onclick event, that I would like to check if any parrent has a specific class
[06:40:11] <pythonholum> .parent() only does the next level up if I remember correctly
[06:41:26] <davoclavo> pythonholum: try this -> if($(element).parents('.class').length){}

[06:49:25] <warbler> can anyone recommend more jquery scripts to make this site even better? http://www.pointstackers.com/ I'm friggin gettin hooked on this jquery stuff
[06:49:54] <hlve[workaholic]> warbler, don't just add jquery scripts for the sake of adding jquery scripts
[06:50:05] <warbler> i want to add them to make the site come alive
[06:50:13] <warbler> so it doesnt look so boring
[06:50:34] <hlve[workaholic]> work on redesigning the website, not cluttering it with neat jquery effects
[06:50:49] <hlve[workaholic]> you're just going to bloat your site
[06:50:51] <warbler> yea ive been meaning to do that...
[06:51:01] <warbler> i want to make it load quicker...
[06:51:23] <hlve[workaholic]> Adding jquery scripts isn't going to make it load quicker...
[06:51:25] <warbler> all those background images of green and yellow arent doing speed any good
[06:51:49] <warbler> i think thats why swagbucks and points2shop use white backgrounds and such
[06:51:55] <warbler> faster load times...
[06:52:15] <hlve[workaholic]> no :3
[06:52:24] <warbler> can you recommend a good web design company?

[06:53:24] * warbler heads for the coffee
[06:53:33] <hlve[workaholic]> llo
[06:53:37] <hlve[workaholic]> I need a coffee.
[06:53:46] <hlve[workaholic]> sorry for being a debby downer
[06:54:06] <halcyon1234> pats_Toms: A bit hacky, but put a loop counter in there. When loop_counter == $("li").length, then MyLoopIsDoneCallback()
[06:54:44] <pats_Toms> halcyon1234: thanks. Really good idea.
[06:55:21] <davoclavo> pats_Toms: but you should cache this: var l = $("li").length;
[06:55:39] <halcyon1234> davoclavo: For sure, no need to run the selector over and over.

[07:21:33] <LekeFly> How can i force the browser to download the newest js file? and not use cached
[07:22:52] <BillCriswell> LekeFly: You can use cache busting or like an expire header dealie.
[07:23:44] <pats_Toms> I have question about ajax here. If that link from where I am taking ajax responses to other url, is there any way to don't get that content on that response, but only that resonsing url
[07:23:48] <pats_Toms> any ideas?
[07:23:58] <BillCriswell> LekeFly: You really should be approaching it differently though if you want to do this. Caching is a good thing.
[07:24:27] <LekeFly> BillCriswell: its just a onetime thing so no need for a random number each time etc
[07:24:57] <davoclavo> LekeFly: If its you who want to reload the cache everytime (eg. for development purposes) you can do ctrl+shift+r / ctrl+f5 on chrome
[07:25:20] <davoclavo> LekeFly: and it may work on other browsers. i'm not sure tho
[07:25:31] <LekeFly> Not just for me.. i couldnt get this to work <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/example.css?v1.0" type="text/css" /> :s

[07:28:09] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure a parameter name can have a . in it without it being encoded.
[07:28:25] <BillCriswell> ?v=1.0 should work.

[08:15:15] <wingdspur> the on change doesnt get triggered when the value is set though keyup event by calling val on it
[08:15:25] <nerk> when you dynamically set the val, also trigger('change') and use a change event to dertermine if the val has changed or not

[08:18:23] <pingou> hi
[08:19:13] <pingou> I'm facing an problem with jQuery 1.9.x, I have one page which contains both a jquery menu and jquery tabs
[08:19:58] <pingou> it seems that the menu performs an ajax call which reload the page and insert into my tab illegal content
[08:21:05] <pingou> (as in the whole page, so I end up with my page embedded within my page)
[08:21:13] <boulet101010_> illegal, you mean, like CP?
[08:21:42] <alaing> i#m using jquery ui tabs 1.8.  I would liek to make one of the tabs like a button i.e if clicked it does somethign but it is not selected like a normal tab
[08:22:05] <nerk> try updating jquery ui as well
[08:22:18] <nerk> to the latest
[08:22:38] <alaing> I figure its part of the tabselect event but I'm having problems trying to pick out the previous tab so i can set the active tab to that one
[08:22:42] <pingou> nerk: jquery-ui-1.9.2

[08:25:14] <AL13N_work> nerk: do you have something in mind?
[08:25:47] <AL13N_work> instead of having a start and stop field, i'd be interesting to have a method to let the user choose how far he wants to go to specify the date

[08:27:53] <pingou> nerk: suggestions to debug?
[08:28:07] <Olive6767> Is there a way in jquery to check if a form element has focus? something like if($("my_form_element").attr('focus')==true
[08:29:07] <aqeel> Olive6767: http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[08:29:36] <BD--> question about underscore.js - i want to use where on a collection of lots of objects of type 'Track'. Track in itself has a property called 'data', which has a property called 'isLocal'. I would suppose that I could filter this using something like "_.where(tracks, { Track.data.isLocal: "true" });" but my editor even tags this as a syntax error :s
[08:30:11] <Olive6767> aqeel: thx :)
[08:30:53] <BD--> can't i use 'dot notation' for the 'properties' parameter ?
[08:31:09] <aqeel> you can
[08:31:18] <aqeel> but jquery uses for chining too
[08:31:25] <aqeel> chaining*
[08:32:37] <BD--> hm, looks like i need to use 'find' instead of where, let's try that
[08:32:43] <shoky> BD-- no you cant use the dot notation there
[08:32:45] <MalMen> how can i check if a input is checked ?
[08:32:54] <shoky> BD-- use filter
[08:32:57] <BD--> aah :)
[08:33:04] <BD--> yea find only returns fist found instance
[08:33:16] <xckpd7> question: can't you put templates in a place other than the html document?
[08:33:21] <shoky> and jquery has $.grep btw
[08:33:25] <xckpd7> assume I'm using handlebars for templating
[08:33:32] <shoky> and EC5 has .filter
[08:33:39] <shoky> or something
[08:33:39] <aqeel> MalMen: http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[08:33:40] <BD--> oh if i can use jquery i'll use that :)
[08:33:41] <xckpd7> but just in general....
[08:34:05] <shoky> BD--: $.grep is fine, just make sure you get the order of the arguments to the callback right
[08:34:11] <shoky> i always get it wrong
[08:34:16] <BD--> ^^

[08:39:53] <shoky> firstclassfunc:  what's a jquery element?
[08:40:11] <shoky> firstclassfunc: anyway.. no, i dont think so ;p
[08:41:50] <firstclassfunc> firstclassfunc: I mean something that you wrap around with $(), such as $('<div>'), to create an element
[08:41:58] <firstclassfunc> for example

[08:43:01] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: $('.xyz').replaceWith(function(){ }); maybe?
[08:43:15] <firstclassfunc> eh maybe, just curious, thanks
[08:44:04] <nerk> http://jsfiddle.net/nKMLk/1/
[08:44:12] <nerk> although that's potentially bubbling issues
[08:44:43] <shoky> "something that you wrap around with $()"
[08:44:55] <shoky> that's really not worth asking about.. it could be any number of different things
[08:45:06] <shoky> most of them cant have classes
[08:45:38] <firstclassfunc> well whatever, you know what I mean because I just gave you an example of what I meant
[08:46:00] <alaing> i#m using jquery ui tabs 1.8.  I would liek to make one of the tabs like a button i.e if clicked it does somethign but it is not selected like a normal tab
[08:46:05] <alaing> I figure its part of the tabselect event but I'm having problems trying to pick out the previous tab so i can set the active tab to that one
[08:46:22] <shoky> firstclassfunc: you cant create an element with no type, no
[08:46:31] <shoky> < class="xyz">
[08:46:33] <shoky> ;]
[08:47:15] <firstclassfunc> well you can't add that to the DOM as a valid element, no. however it's theoretically possible with jquery
[08:47:25] <shoky> how so?
[08:47:29] <BD--> shoky: are there also jquery equivalents to _'s groupBy and countBy methods ?
[08:47:46] <BD--> and how do these sort of methods compare performance wise ?
[08:48:14] <shoky> BD--: no equivalents for those
[08:48:29] <nerk> firstclassfunc: that makes no sense as jquery just eases and utilizes dom manipulation
[08:49:03] <shoky> BD--: performance wise between jquery and underscore?  same performance for these utility methods more or less
[08:50:00] <BD--> ok, thanks a lot !
[08:50:20] <systemfault> lodash is a faster implementation of underscore... if you care
[08:51:18] <BD--> i do, thanks ! :)
[08:52:37] <boulet101010_> prototype / this question => http://jsfiddle.net/MF24Y/ please look at my fiddle
[08:53:39] <boulet101010_> ewwww i got it.
[08:54:15] <shoky> .bind(this)
[08:54:19] <rotham> hey... with the datepicker can I set it to use a different format for displaying the date and sending it to the server?
[08:54:48] <rotham> all my serverside code expects yyyy-mm-dd, and i need to switch the UI to use mm/dd/yyyy
[08:55:30] <boulet101010_> ty shoky
[08:57:56] <shoky> rotham: the datepicker doesnt send anything to the server.. i think..?
[08:58:17] <boulet101010_> shoky: you meant to use a delegated event?
[08:58:19] <rotham> how about setting the value different.. or maybe i just should use a hidden field for that
[08:58:28] <shoky> rotham: and you can switch the UI format with the dateFormat option
[08:58:34] <boulet101010_> because sadly i don't get it
[08:58:49] <shoky> boulet101010_:  i meant    click:  this.action.bind(this)
[08:58:58] <boulet101010_> kk =)
[08:59:10] <mandarks> hey guys, if i wonna split a string into an array based on the number of characters, if their a function is jQuery for me or am i gonna have to write 1?
[08:59:24] <mandarks> *is
[08:59:30] <mandarks> *in
[09:00:15] <boulet101010_> cu
[09:00:30] <shoky> mandarks: there's no jquery function for that.. jquery isn't about string manipulation. what exactly do you need
[09:01:10] <mandarks> shoky: i need a text area's height to be relative to the text in the area
[09:01:21] <shoky> :o
[09:01:33] <shoky> good luck with that ;p
[09:02:21] <mandarks> i dont need luck, guess im gonna have to go old skool then
[09:02:29] <mandarks> ;)
[09:03:03] <shoky> javascript has .split ;p
[09:03:55] <dns-away> ty nerk
[09:04:02] <mandarks> i know, but it would have to look for return lines which their are none of as the text is wrapped.. just 1 great long sting im afraid
[09:04:19] <mandarks> *string
[09:05:33] <BD--> wow, for countBy, lodash is like ~50% faster than underscore =o
[09:05:50] <mandarks> actually, screw that.. i'll just use a div,expand to fit "I LOVE IT"
[09:07:56] <BD--> and filter on an object 120% faster :')
[09:09:10] <shoky> ?eval '12345678901234567890123'.match(/.{1,5}/g)
[09:09:11] <bot-t> shoky: ["12345", "67890", "12345", "67890", "123"]
[09:24:36] <Taloncor> Problem: I'd like to have a <select>-element in a jquery-ui dialog titlebar. Problem is that said <select>-element doesnt react to left mouse clicks (in firefox). Any Ideas how to solve that?
[09:24:52] <brianjcohen> Question:  I have a click event bound, via .live(), to an element that was inserted to the DOM dynamically via .append(). The click event calls a function that makes use of .parents(). It seems .parents() is not matching elements it should, I'm guessing because the elements in question were inserted late. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[09:25:05] <amaninacan> Hello. I have a pretty simple question about jQuery.ajax. What exactly determines $.ajax().done() vs $.ajax().fail()?
[09:27:00] <johnkpaul> amaninacan: the status code sent back by the http request
[09:27:15] <amaninacan> k, what status codes indicate failure? anything other than 200?
[09:27:25] <johnkpaul> anything other than 2**
[09:27:27] <amaninacan> er, 200/300
[09:27:27] <johnkpaul> IIRC
[09:27:41] <amaninacan> really? 3xx also is considered fail?
[09:27:53] <johnkpaul> redirects are handled transparently by the browser
[09:28:02] <amaninacan> ah true
[09:28:03] <amaninacan> okay
[09:28:06] <amaninacan> thanks!
[09:28:09] <johnkpaul> no problem
[09:34:48] <rabbi1> i have got a dropdown list (using bootstrap and/or css3), on selecting the item, it should pass the value of a selected item to 'class', 'href' and 'value' of an <a> tag ? how can i achieve this ?
[09:35:24] <BD--> being new to js, i'm really bothered by associative arrays (in fact, objects) not having an order... are there any articles out there that tell me how to deal with this ?
[09:35:57] <wroathe> BD you can manually give them order...
[09:36:43] <BD--> the properties/keys seem to get ordere alphabetically ?
[09:36:55] <wroathe> http://i.imgur.com/dU4vK.png
[09:37:26] <BD--> try to get the 1 before the 0 :p
[09:38:53] <shoky> BD-- if you want order, use an array
[09:39:09] <shoky> it's the same in any programming language, just with different names..
[09:39:17] <masak> BD--: the reason they aren't ordered is so that lookup will be fast. you can always sort the keys of an associative array when you want the keys to be ordered.
[09:40:42] <BD--> actually, i want to sort the key by the value, so imagine i have {x: 5, y: 10}, i want to iterate over all 'properties' in reverse order of their value, so y first, then x
[09:41:13] <BD--> how do i transform that associative array to an array with the reversely ordered keys
[09:41:59] <BD--> i imagine a combination of _.select and _.sortBy is needed, but i cant figure it out :D
[09:45:59] <BillCriswell> Any of you guys ever get the request "Guess how long X would take to do" on a site you never even looked at or know what it's running?
[09:47:15] <wroathe> BillCriswell: You'll have to be more specific...
[09:47:25] <BillCriswell> wroathe: Thats what I said exactly.
[09:48:11] <shoky> BD--: example..  var obj = {x: 5, y: 10};  var arr = $.map(obj, function(val, key) { return {key:key,val:val} });  arr.sort(function(a,b) { return b.val - a.val });
[09:48:32] <BillCriswell> I need to add product category and attribute filtering to a site. That's all they said.
[09:48:33] <shoky> probably can be simpler with underscore, im just not well-versed in it
[09:50:09] <wroathe> BillCriswell: Then ask them to give you some idea of what the categories and attributes look like...
[09:50:17] <firstclassfunc> var div = $('<div>'); -- how can I make 10 copies of this element?
[09:50:45] <BillCriswell> wroathe: The minute I ask for more information about the task they're like "JUST GUESS" lol
[09:50:56] <wroathe> BillCriswell: Then tell them to fuck off...
[09:52:03] <BillCriswell> wroathe: I did that basically. Got in trouble. Then they apologized.
[09:52:13] <shoky> guessing is easy
[09:52:24] <BillCriswell> I made up a number.
[09:52:28] <shoky> exactly
[09:52:29] <BillCriswell> I said "53 hours"
[09:52:38] <shoky> solid number
[09:52:39] <NoiseEee> firstclassfunc: clone it
[09:52:59] <firstclassfunc> NoiseEee: it hasn't been added to the DOM. When I call .clone(), it says clone isn't a function
[09:53:22] <shoky> ?eval $('<div>').clone
[09:53:25] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: Sure you have jQuery in there?
[09:53:41] <bot-t> shoky: No output. (Process Killed)
[09:53:47] <firstclassfunc> blah, typo. I forgot the dollar sign in front of the parens.
[09:53:50] <shoky> :(
[09:56:43] <fedya> i'm having an issue with the validator plugin, I have a 2 step form, one of the fields in the first step uses a remote validation method, and there's a click event on the next button to go to the next step if $(this).valid(); the problem is valid() returns true before the remote validation returns potentially allowing you to click next with an invalid email address in the field. I was looking at possibly using a wait() call to wa
[09:56:43] <fedya> until all the fields in the first step are valid, or any other ideas?
[09:56:55] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: http://jsbin.com/icuzus/1/edit Cleanest way I can think of?
[09:59:22] <firstclassfunc> yeah that works, wonder how fast it is compared to .createElement('div') or whatever
[10:00:22] <BillCriswell> I'm sure createElement would be faster, but I doubt it would matter in most cases.
[10:01:01] <Taloncor> I need help with the jquery-ui dialog. See this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cma4X/1/
[10:01:01] <Taloncor> In Firefox i cannot use the select form element in the dialog title, it just doesn't respond to left clicks (strangely right clicking it works quite well)
[10:01:01] <Taloncor> Any ideas?
[10:05:21] <firstclassfunc> BillCriswell: I am building the next facebook, I need it fast fast fast
[10:05:52] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: Might I recommend http://vanilla-js.com/
[10:06:46] <NoiseEee> lol
[10:07:14] <aqeel> Taloncor: you just specify click, but what to do on click
[10:08:00] <Taloncor> aqeel: Thats just for debugging purpose. I just want the select to behave normally
[10:08:29] <aqeel> what is your whols scope, you might be approaching wrongly
[10:08:36] <aqeel> whole*
[10:09:43] <aqeel> .dialog() is this jquery ui?
[10:09:43] <xckpd7> no way VanillaJS is being used on more sites than jQuery
[10:09:48] <xckpd7> #falseadvertising
[10:09:59] <Taloncor> aqeel: Yes, ist jquery-ui
[10:10:30] <Taloncor> aqeel: Only problem is the fact that the select does not work properly in firefox. Works quite fine in Google Chrome and used to work in firefox too
[10:10:36] <ajpiano> xckpd7: every site that uses jquery is using vanilla-js
[10:10:43] <ajpiano> vanilla-js is joke ware, it's just regular javascript
[10:11:47] <xckpd7> ajpiano: yeah I know. trolling. you're the guy that wrote vapor.js
[10:12:38] <ajpiano> no i'm not
[10:12:52] <ajpiano> contrary to popular reports, alex and i are different people
[10:13:01] <xckpd7> oh... whoops
[10:13:26] <xckpd7> well that's embarrassing. I'll slink away now.
[10:15:21] <firstclassfunc> man I love jquery
[10:16:14] <BillCriswell> vapor.js is a new one for me.
[10:17:01] <BillCriswell> I now see why.
[10:17:09] <BillCriswell> jQuery is snazzy.
[10:17:45] <BillCriswell> http://html9responsiveboilerstrapjs.com/ is nice.
[10:20:26] <BD--> shoky: thanks, the map + sortBy method works... quite a heap of code though for something so basic, if you ask me :)
[10:23:05] <firstclassfunc> whoa, it's cross-universe compatible BillCriswell, gnarly
[10:23:24] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: Only the most compatible.
[10:28:14] <hlve[workaholic]> I may need some JSON halp. :3
[10:30:27] <firstclassfunc> how so?
[10:40:30] <rabbi1>  I need help on changing the content of last a <a> tag with the content of clicked(indexed) <a> tag value. kindly help.... http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/7/
[10:44:31] <rabbi1> anybody there?
[10:44:56] <shoky> rabbi1: .html() = ln;
[10:44:58] <shoky> doesnt work..
[10:45:03] <shoky> .html( ln )
[10:45:07] <shoky> er
[10:45:11] <shoky> also.. not .last
[10:45:13] <shoky> .last(0
[10:45:15] <shoky> .last()
[10:45:45] <rabbi1> shoky: i know my code is wrong, but i just put it for an idea. ...
[10:46:17] <shoky> :\
[10:46:41] <nerk_> that code is all wrong
[10:46:42] <nerk_> here
[10:46:43] <nerk_> http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/8/
[10:46:51] <nerk_> much simplier
[10:46:51] <rabbi1> how can i get the index and bind it? coz any link i click A,B,C i only get A...
[10:47:11] <nerk_> why do you need the index?
[10:47:16] <nerk_> that is what $(this) is reserved for
[10:47:17] <shoky> you dont need any index
[10:47:34] <nerk_> just look at my update, works fine
[10:48:15] <rabbi1> shoky: topLink li a .last is changing the last <a> tag of subLink class :(
[10:48:36] <shoky> rabbi1: this is basic jquery.. as nerk_ said you use 'this' or $(this)  to get the clicked element
[10:48:47] <nerk_> rabbi1: look at http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/8/
[10:48:49] <shoky> rabbi1:  http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[10:48:54] <nerk_> things will be much clearer
[10:49:53] <rabbi1> nerk_: i saw it, great, this will get the link i clicked, but i don want to replace the Link C, i have to add to Link 4 <a> tag
[10:50:52] <nerk_> sorry, not following?
[10:50:52] <rabbi1> which infact is not the las li of topLink, its a last but least. can i use last(-1) ?
[10:51:11] <nerk_> no
[10:51:16] <nerk_> get(index)
[10:51:31] <shoky> ?eq
[10:51:32] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[10:51:32] <nerk_> index starting at 0
[10:51:40] <nerk_> err.. yah.. sorry eq
[10:51:45] <nerk_> get gets the raw dom element
[10:52:32] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/9/ -- ok i think i have achieved with a little extra class shoky is this correct ?
[10:52:41] <rabbi1> shoky: ^
[10:53:06] <shoky> rabbi1 does it do what you want..
[10:53:20] <shoky> don't really need the .last() there
[10:53:24] <rabbi1> shoky: yeah, i can also remove the last() from there
[10:53:27] <shoky> as there is only one such <a>
[10:53:29] <rabbi1> yeah, bingo
[10:53:45] <rabbi1> but without adding a class,i can't do it ?
[10:54:11] <shoky> there are many different ways to get to any element
[10:54:25] <shoky> using a class/id makes it simple..
[10:56:52] <rabbi1> shoky: i actually, need to add that value three places, 1. inside <a> tag and 2. inside href of <a> tag and after ng-click="Link *" inside <li> tag (angularjs)... http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/10/ ----  where ever i have added "HERE" there is what i want that "Link A/B/C" appear....
[10:57:53] <shoky> eh you're using an MVC framework .. you have better ways of manipulating the view :\
[10:58:45] <rabbi1> shoky: so for href i can attr....
[10:58:47] <shoky> better ways than using jquery selectors to get at elements
[10:59:03] <rabbi1> *use attr
[10:59:05] <shoky> donno what you want man. go for it
[10:59:29] <rabbi1> shoky: thanks, will get back
[11:00:02] <shoky> and yes you can use attr
[11:03:14] <barfoo365> I am trying to do something really simple but am failing at the first hurdle!  I have jQuery('.blank').attr('src', url); which gives me the url i want but how can i save this as a variable so i can use it elsewhere?
[11:03:48] <shoky> barfoo365:  you're using .attr as a setter there
[11:03:56] <shoky> barfoo365: setting the src attribute to url's value
[11:04:12] <barfoo365> so src is already the variable i need?
[11:04:23] <shoky> huh no. src is the name of the attribute
[11:04:44] <barfoo365> I want the url to be used in jQuery('myOjbect').css('background-image', 'url("' + imageUrl + '")');
[11:04:50] <shoky> to get the current value of the src attribute:  var url = $(whatever).attr('src');
[11:05:25] <rabbi1> shoky: this is what i wanted, http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/13/  thanks a lot for your time :) have a great day ...
[11:05:38] <shoky> np RA3OR
[11:05:40] <shoky> er rabbi1
[11:05:57] <rabbi1> shoky: hope its simple and best way... ;)
[11:06:31] * RA3OR smellz shoky
[11:06:44] <RA3OR> you rang?
[11:08:28] <shoky> RA3OR: wrong nick sry
[11:08:32] <shoky> thanks for sniffing
[11:09:45] <tevfik> BillCriswell html9 it works something behind.
[11:09:58] <defaultro_> hey folks, does .append() work in Chrome?
[11:10:07] <shoky> defaultro_: of course
[11:10:23] <defaultro_> ok, not sure why our app doesn't work in Chrome
[11:10:27] <shoky> ok
[11:10:57] <defaultro_> I manually execute the $('#id').append("something"); didn't work
[11:11:07] <defaultro_> $('#id').hide() works
[11:11:15] <shoky> bummer
[11:11:18] <defaultro_> i know
[11:11:24] <defaultro_> any work arounds?
[11:11:36] <shoky> you know the drill already
[11:11:38] <shoky> ?demo @ defaultro
[11:11:39] <bot-t> defaultro, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:11:51] <defaultro_> yeah, site is still internal
[11:12:00] <shoky> $('#id').append("something") works , in chrome
[11:12:05] <defaultro_> i'll try to mimic it on jsfiddle
[11:12:08] <shoky> so you have to find a better way to explain your problem.
[11:12:15] <defaultro_> will do
[11:15:23] <WebDragon> jsfiddle is good for that sort of thing .. reducing the problem down to smaller chunks to help more easily spot what's gone agley
[11:15:57] <defaultro_> shoky: this should work right, $('#id').append('<form>First name: <input type="text" name="firstname"><br>Last name: <input type="text" name="lastname"></form>');
[11:16:17] <shoky> defaultro_: we're past such questions. ask with a fiddle
[11:16:27] <defaultro_> ok
[11:16:34] <shoky> why should i try to mimic the browser engine in my head?
[11:17:56] <defaultro_> :)
[11:18:17] <defaultro_> one more, I am thinking issue is with z-index. How can I edit that to have a z-index of 999
[11:18:29] <shoky> css
[11:19:08] <defaultro_> k
[11:19:28] <MistuhKurtz> that will work but it's not very elegant defaultro_
[11:19:32] <defaultro_> i'm looking at chrome debug window and it's really being added
[11:19:42] <defaultro_> so maybe it's just hidden
[11:20:07] <defaultro_> maybe rather than append, I should use appendTo.
[11:20:18] <MistuhKurtz> why not just have it hidden by default and call $("#id form").show();
[11:20:37] <defaultro_> it works well in Firefox
[11:20:45] <defaultro_> i'll try that approach
[11:21:19] <MistuhKurtz> yeah, mixing too much markup in your js gets a little ugly and difficult to manage
[11:21:38] <defaultro_> I saw the form I added using .append(). It got appended to the end of ('#id') tree
[11:21:50] <tevfik> guys do you know how to decode compressed javascript?
[11:22:17] <defaultro_> i'll create another form and add inline css and use z-index 999
[11:22:30] <dylan9o4> hi all, i was wondering if there was a preferred method to image rotation, upon trying jquery.rotate.js, i noticed alot of bouncing. was wondering if i could get a lil help
[11:22:43] <shoky> why inline css :\
[11:22:48] <shoky> dont be ugly
[11:23:08] <hlve[workaholic]> Shoky. can you help me with a stupid simple jquery issue? http://jsfiddle.net/pNrjk/7/
[11:23:10] <hlve[workaholic]> I don't get it
[11:23:17] <hlve[workaholic]> I can't figure out the most simple stuff.
[11:23:33] <shoky> hlve[workaholic]: if you say what the issue is, perhaps
[11:23:57] <hlve[workaholic]> basically, I want it to fire off an alert if the radio with that value is selected
[11:24:01] <hlve[workaholic]> but... I'm stupid.
[11:24:14] <shoky> if it is selected, when?
[11:24:24] <shoky> you have no event handlers
[11:24:24] <hlve[workaholic]> when a user clicks
[11:24:25] <NoiseEee> hlve[workaholic]: too crazy a question to be asking from someone here for months
[11:24:45] <hlve[workaholic]> eh
[11:24:45] <hlve[workaholic]> you're right
[11:24:47] <shoky> then what about a click handler..
[11:24:47] <hlve[workaholic]> I'm really stupid
[11:24:51] <hlve[workaholic]> lol
[11:28:44] <hlve[workaholic]> well, on a larger scale, I have a form with multiple radios, and if a user has radio with value a selected, I need it to fire a function.
[11:28:44] <shoky> if user has radio
[11:28:44] <shoky> ..
[11:28:44] <defaultro_> I can't highlight the output in Chrome debug panel so I can paste it in pastebin
[11:28:44] <hlve[workaholic]> i'm not explaining this very well
[11:28:44] <shoky> hlve[workaholic]: try english
[11:28:44] <hlve[workaholic]> I'm trying
[11:28:44] <hlve[workaholic]> :(
[11:28:45] <tevfik> guys do you know any javascript decomposer?
[11:28:45] <daniell__> hey all
[11:29:19] <systemfault> tevfik: The backspace key on your keyboard.
[11:29:30] <systemfault> tevfik: What is a javascript decomposer?
[11:29:31] <tevfik> decompressor
[11:29:33] <salientKnight> hey all
[11:29:40] <tevfik> sorry it was a typo
[11:29:43] <systemfault> tevfik: You can use the one shipped with chrome
[11:30:03] <systemfault> tevfik: You click the {} button when on the source tab
[11:30:08] <shoky> hlve[workaholic]: example.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pNrjk/8/
[11:30:33] <tevfik> hmm
[11:30:52] <NoiseEee> hlve[workaholic]: too crazy a question to be asking from someone here for months
[11:30:54] <systemfault> tevfik: If it's not good enough, google for a "javascript prettifier"
[11:31:08] <NoiseEee> hlve[workaholic]: have you actually learned stuff being here, or are just getting some free code pasted to you?
[11:31:17] <salientKnight> can anyone help me with touch drag/drop/ create... I have drag and drop working from code that I found http://pastebin.com/8GsLzfdD  but I need to be able to tell the source from which the drag is starting and create a new instance of the object if its from the "toolbar" and just move it if its from the "pallet"  can anyone point me in the right direction?
[11:31:37] <tevfik> systemfault I have found some website
[11:31:44] <tevfik> "prettifier"
[11:31:47] <defaultro_> looks like i figured the issue
[11:31:50] <tevfik> they are just re-indent to code
[11:32:02] <defaultro_> append() was adding it to a div whose class was set to hidden
[11:32:21] <shoky> tevfik: there is no way to get back the original variables names, if thats what you want ;]
[11:32:41] <defaultro_> how do make a new div so that it doesn't get added to that existing div?
[11:32:51] <tevfik> shoky no i found
[11:32:52] <tevfik> http://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html
[11:32:54] <tevfik> here it's
[11:33:10] <tevfik> If there is a way to go, there must be a way to back shoky  :)
[11:33:14] <tevfik> thanks all
[11:33:14] <tevfik> :)
[11:33:15] <shoky> defaultro_: var newDiv = $('<div>');
[11:33:24] <defaultro_> cool
[11:33:39] <shoky> tevfik: uhh thats not true..
[11:33:42] <defaultro_> will that also terminate it?
[11:33:56] <shoky> tevfik:  if i changed 'hello' to 'h'  then the 'ello' is lost....
[11:34:08] <defaultro_> i mean, does it make it like  this -> <div></div>
[11:34:18] <tevfik> shoky hello and h is same for me in coding
[11:34:20] <shoky> defaultro_: yes. go try
[11:34:31] <shoky> tevfik: then no idea what you want
[11:34:46] <tevfik> shoky http://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html look this page you will understand what i mean
[11:34:55] <tevfik> thanks anyway :)
[11:34:55] <defaultro_> cool
[11:35:20] <salientKnight> tevfik are you looking for a way to unobfuscate code?
[11:35:31] <shoky> tevfik: eh..
[11:35:44] <tevfik> salientKnight I found what i'm searching
[11:36:54] <defaultro_> shoky, so from this $('#id').append(html);     into this      var newDiv = $('<div>'); $('#id').append(newDiv + html);
[11:37:18] <fission6> anyone here using select2, i am having an issue where everything is working fine but that on page load it takes a split second to transform my selects into the select2s, should i hide these are or something?
[11:37:44] <shoky> defaultro_:  newDiv + html ? no
[11:37:54] <shoky> defaultro_: you're adding a jquery element to an html string.....
[11:37:55] <defaultro_> what would it be?
[11:38:14] <shoky> defaultro_: you want that html to be inside the newDiv right
[11:38:16] <defaultro_> html variable contains form tags
[11:38:21] <defaultro_> yes
[11:38:34] <shoky> and how do you change an element's html?
[11:39:25] <systemfault> defaultro_: Stop thinking in terms of HTML, once the browser has parsed the initial HTML... it creates a "tree" structure with Nodes representing the tags... And with Javascript, you work with those nodes, not the HTML.
[11:39:56] <shoky> defaultro_:  $('<div>').html(html).appendTo('#id')
[11:40:04] <NoiseEee> !learn @ defaultro_
[11:40:04] <b-ot> defaultro_, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:40:59] <rabbi1> how can i remove a content of a variable in jquery? suppose var test = "<li><span>Content to be removed including the span tag</span>Testing</li>". how can i replace the value of test to "<li>Testing</li> ?
[11:43:39] <fission6> any ideas how to avoid t his?
[11:44:20] <shoky> rabbi1: var t = $('<div>').append(test); t.find('span').remove(); test = t.html();
[11:45:16] <rabbi1> shoky: thank you
[11:47:50] <Eduard_Munteanu> Hi. I want to write a small javascript function that issues a DELETE request like here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2153917/how-to-send-a-put-delete-request-in-jquery
[11:48:26] <Eduard_Munteanu> How do I make it retrieve a document as if it were a normal GET request? I don't need the request to occur asynchronously or anything.
[11:48:59] <shoky> what's not normal?
[11:49:21] <psilo3> For some reason $.support is undefined in my app, any ideas why?
[11:49:32] <Eduard_Munteanu> shoky: AFAICT, that snippet will send a DELETE request in the background and not get a new document in return.
[11:49:52] <shoky> Eduard_Munteanu:  get a new document? why would it get a new document.. what do you mean
[11:49:58] <NoiseEee> Eduard_Munteanu: you'd have to do two calls.
[11:50:14] <NoiseEee> DELETE deletes, yeah?
[11:50:21] <Eduard_Munteanu> Yes.
[11:50:28] <NoiseEee> so where/why would you expect a new document
[11:50:45] <R00tk3y> Best filter flag for filtering a comment on website, since #php is invite only
[11:50:45] <Eduard_Munteanu> Hm, fair point.
[11:51:08] <shoky> R00tk3y it's not invite only, you need to register your nick
[11:51:09] <Eduard_Munteanu> I guess I just want to reload the current page then.
[11:51:35] <R00tk3y> Woops forgot to login, thanks shoky
[11:52:35] <NoiseEee> Eduard_Munteanu: so do that in the callback
[11:53:12] <Eduard_Munteanu> Yeah, I suppose the semantics of PUT/DELETE are different from GET/POST (which normally give you a page in return)
[11:53:31] <shoky> they give you whatever the server responds with
[11:53:37] <shoky> same with PUT/DELETE afaik
[11:54:07] <Eduard_Munteanu> Right, I'm just trying to work around the lack of PUT/DELETE support in HTML, I'm not trying to make async requests.
[11:54:31] <Eduard_Munteanu> If I could, I'd use a form, but there's no support for arbitrary methods.
[11:54:43] <shoky> doesnt matter if its async or not
[11:54:53] <shoky> if you want to reload the page, do it
[11:55:30] <Eduard_Munteanu> Can I load the server reply as the new page?
[11:55:58] <Eduard_Munteanu> Because e.g. a POST reply might be different than a POST+GET.
[11:56:09] <Eduard_Munteanu> (same thing should apply to DELETE)
[11:56:21] <shoky> ideally you wouldnt reload anything and just update whatever you need to (if at all) in the ajax callback
[11:56:30] <shoky> based on the server's resposne (if any)
[11:56:43] <shoky> for example the server could return JSON
[11:56:55] <Eduard_Munteanu> Yeah, that's true.
[11:57:10] <hlve[workaholic]> Any reason why my ajax is hitting an error when it queries a 200?
[11:57:17] <hlve[workaholic]> what's the best way to debug that?
[11:57:25] <shoky> hlve[workaholic]: probably a JSON parsing error
[11:57:29] <shoky> or something
[11:57:30] <shoky> ;S
[11:57:42] <AnonymousPrime> ^^ votes json parsing error
[11:57:48] <AnonymousPrime> use chrome dev tools to look at the response coming back
[11:58:11] <AnonymousPrime> c/p that into a json validator/parser to see if it's valid
[11:58:24] <AnonymousPrime> like this one: http://json.parser.online.fr/
[12:00:17] <hlve[workaholic]> the status replies back with 200 OK
[12:00:21] <hlve[workaholic]> ;/
[12:00:32] <hlve[workaholic]> The response coming back is the data I need.
[12:00:43] <shoky> hlve: no errors in console?
[12:00:46] <AnonymousPrime> but does it parse to json?
[12:00:48] <R00tk3y> Is there a way to prevent javascript from being executed in a certain division
[12:01:00] <shoky> hlve: pastebin the response, and your ajax code
[12:01:05] <AnonymousPrime> json that comes back as text will look like json, but that doesn't mean it will eval to it
[12:01:37] <shoky> R00tk3y: division?
[12:02:26] <R00tk3y> Like a no javascript zone
[12:02:32] <shoky> huh?
[12:02:41] <R00tk3y> I have a comment area on my siter
[12:02:43] <R00tk3y> Site
[12:03:00] <R00tk3y> If someone is able to get passed my php filtering
[12:03:10] <R00tk3y> Is there a way to disable javascript inside of a div
[12:03:19] <shoky> no
[12:04:57] <vacho> how can I traverse backwards with jquery??
[12:05:08] <vacho> lets say I am currently on a TD and I want to pick the TD before that?
[12:05:18] <AnonymousPrime> vacho .before
[12:05:18] <shoky> vacho: .prev .prevUntil .prevAll
[12:05:22] <shoky> not .before
[12:05:23] <AnonymousPrime> i mean prev
[12:05:28] <AnonymousPrime> shaky wins
[12:05:31] <vacho> thanks!
[12:10:31] <kripster> hey people
[12:11:08] <kripster> can someone help me with a simple jquery issue i am havnig please
[12:12:03] <wachpwnski> kripster: just ask
[12:12:19] <Davey> How do I allow for $(foo).bar() and $(foo).bar.baz() ?
[12:13:19] <hlve[workaholic]> I know you can't really help because I can't put this up on jsfiddle or even show you an example, but is there any reason why a JSON request would automatically add a parameter to the end of the request?
[12:13:21] <shoky> Davey: it's not really reccommended to do that
[12:13:44] <kripster> ok, cheers, i am trying to uncheck a radio button by the click of a button, i select the following
[12:13:45] <Davey> shoky: but I hate the $(foo).bar('baz') syntax :/
[12:13:47] <hlve[workaholic]> it's adding a ?_= random generated parameter.
[12:13:48] <kripster>    $('#rbn').click(function () {
[12:13:48] <kripster>     $('#rb1')checked = false;
[12:13:48] <kripster>    });
[12:13:48] <hlve[workaholic]> r;lmskmde
[12:14:04] <kripster> any ideas why this doesnt work?
[12:14:06] <ajpiano> hlve[workaholic]: cache: false
[12:14:09] <ajpiano> does that
[12:14:24] <Davey> hlve[workaholic]: it's to avoid hitting the browser cache, I believe
[12:14:30] <hlve[workaholic]> Ahh
[12:14:35] <hlve[workaholic]> that solved that
[12:14:46] <hlve[workaholic]> is there any reason why a 200 OK return would still be being seen as an error?
[12:14:49] <Davey> shoky: any suggestions on a better way to structure my plugin API? :)
[12:14:52] <hlve[workaholic]> :[
[12:14:58] <shoky> Davey: actually its impossible to do that ;p
[12:15:10] <Davey> shoky: yeah, I hit an infinite loop, it seems
[12:15:14] <ajpiano> it isn't *impossible*
[12:15:27] <shoky> its impossible to keep the 'this' pointer
[12:15:34] <shoky> is what i meant
[12:15:35] <ajpiano> $.fn.bar = function() {  return { baz: function() {} };  };
[12:15:38] <ajpiano> yea
[12:15:39] <ajpiano> :)
[12:16:06] <shoky> mm
[12:16:07] <Davey> ajpiano: but that doesn't chain then
[12:16:11] <ajpiano> right
[12:16:17] <ajpiano> in general it's not a good pattern
[12:16:22] <ajpiano> i would recommend you try the jquery ui widget factory
[12:16:25] <kripster> anu suggestions?
[12:17:09] <ajpiano> Davey: https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns
[12:17:39] <ajpiano> Davey: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[12:17:54] <kripster> if the id of a radio button is rbi will on the click of a button the function is call to $('#rb1').checked = false, why doesnt that uncheck the button?????
[12:18:29] <ajpiano> kripster: dom properties don't exist jQuery objects.  $("#rb1").prop("checked", false) or $("#rb1")[0].checked=false;
[12:21:26] <shoky> hlve[workaholic]: what's the error?
[12:25:57] <kripster> anyone help me with how to uncheck a radio button on the click of a button?
[12:26:02] <ajpiano> ?demo @ kripster
[12:26:03] <bot-t> kripster, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:26:18] <kripster> ok cheers, first time in this room
[12:26:26] <shoky> kripster: ajpiano gave you the answer, you didnt get it?
[12:26:37] <ajpiano> he pmed me to say that it didn't work :p
[12:26:40] <Gho5t> is there a term for disabling/enabling a button? similar to how hiding/showing is called toggling?
[12:26:42] <shoky> o ;]
[12:27:21] <shoky> Gho5t: yes, disabling/enabling is the term
[12:27:26] <shoky> oh
[12:27:28] <BillCriswell> Gho5t: Changing its.. state? Maybe.
[12:27:45] <shoky> you mean a jquery method, not a term ?
[12:27:54] <Gho5t> no just a general term
[12:27:56] <shoky> cause in english, that'd be toggle too ;)
[12:28:08] <Gho5t> so i don't have a stuipd function called enableDisableButton()
[12:28:19] <shoky> toggleButtonEnabled()
[12:28:25] <shoky> or smth
[12:29:06] <rabbi1> shoky: all my problems solved..... http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/21/  thanks... good day/ night bye bye
[12:29:18] <Gho5t> ok so i guess the answer is no
[12:29:20] <Gho5t> np thanks
[12:29:50] <BillCriswell> changeButtonState()?
[12:29:58] <BillCriswell> toggleButtonState()
[12:30:05] <AnonymousPrime> toggleAvailability() ?
[12:30:06] <Gho5t> i like that
[12:30:14] <Gho5t> or shoky's togglebuttonenabled
[12:30:23] <AnonymousPrime> his is less verbose
[12:30:27] <Gho5t> yeah
[12:30:31] <shoky> most descriptive
[12:30:46] <shoky> which is what matters.. to me, at least
[12:30:48] <wroathe> doStuff();
[12:30:53] <vacho> would u call this unacceptable: http://pastebin.com/BjMqrbsp
[12:30:59] <wroathe> returnThings();
[12:31:06] <Gho5t> very nice wroathe
[12:31:14] <Gho5t> would love to read your code sometime : )
[12:31:20] <BD--> ok i give up, i don't see what i'm doing wrong. Inside some callback function, i try to append some data to some element. But it seems like I can't get the selector to select the element - it always returns 'undefined' when alerted or '[]' when output to console, and appending something doesn't do anything... can anyone help me out ?
[12:31:29] <wroathe> You don't READ me code... you EXPERIENCE it.
[12:31:40] <Gho5t> holy.shit.
[12:31:48] <shoky> vacho: it doesnt look very nice, but i wouldnt say its unacceptable ;] if it works, that is
[12:31:48] <BD--> i'm simply using var ul = $('#favoriteArtists'); and further down the page there's <ul id="favoriteArtists"><li>dummy</li></ul>
[12:31:51] <Gho5t> i have a boner
[12:32:11] <vacho> shoky: thank you.. i'll tell my boss that shoky gave me OK on #jquery :D
[12:32:36] <AnonymousPrime> BD-- you calling yr code after doc is ready?
[12:32:52] <BD--> yop, that code is inside $(document).ready(calculateTopArtists(function(artists) {
[12:33:01] <shoky> umm
[12:33:22] <shoky> that looks suspicious
[12:33:43] <shoky> ?demo @ BD--
[12:33:43] <bot-t> BD--, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:34:10] <BD--> i'll try :)
[12:39:29] <kripster> no this is weird, heres my running code http://jsfiddle.net/2ecHH/7/
[12:39:49] <kripster> it works here but not on my project
[12:41:49] <kripster> it runs on internet explorer but not chrome
[12:41:49] <BillCriswell> kripster: That means something else is fucking it up.
[12:42:14] <kripster> thats for your technical input bill, any ideas how to fix it?
[12:42:36] <BillCriswell> kripster: It's what I do.
[12:42:44] <kripster> lol
[12:42:55] <BillCriswell> kripster: It's hard to tell without knowing what's in all your JS files.
[12:43:25] <kripster> i have the running code at http://jsfiddle.net/2ecHH/7/, its a crappy little example
[12:43:40] <BD--> nevermind, found it (reproducing it on jsfiddle helped ^^) - the usual newb mistake: instead of passing a function as a callback, i called the function directy,... silly silly :p
[12:45:07] <BillCriswell> kripster: Could it be that //section part?
[12:45:31] <BillCriswell> kripster: The doctype isn't valid either I don't think.
[12:45:42] <salientKnight> anyone know an event for tough moving that only triggers when tough ends?
[12:45:56] <salientKnight> touchend seems to be firing a whole mess of times
[12:46:10] <NoiseEee> i got fired for touching ends
[12:46:11] <kripster> doc type,sorry i am a newb at this
[12:46:16] <BillCriswell> salientKnight: touchstart maybe?
[12:47:13] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: I got a promotion for the same thing.
[12:47:20] <BryanRuiz> im trying to add a nice fade effect on this roll over but failed with an infinite loop
[12:47:21] <BryanRuiz> http://jsfiddle.net/6N7gu/
[12:47:24] <salientKnight> BillCriswell, I need this triggered at the end of the move
[12:47:28] <NoiseEee> lol @ BillCriswell
[12:47:33] <bil`> if i load a script via $.getScript or $.ajax, is there a way to view said script in chrome's dev tools? It seems that it doesn't show in the sources panel even after its loaded
[12:47:57] <BillCriswell> salientKnight: Duh. Sorry... Getting close to 5.
[12:48:30] <salientKnight> I have touchstart and touchmove and touchend bound to my object and thought touchend would only be triggered when the touching stops, but its firing a whole mess of times.
[12:48:35] <BryanRuiz> i think fade out is triggering a mouse leave when it shouldnt
[12:48:50] <BillCriswell> salientKnight: I don't have much experience with touch events to be honest. You might have to debounce it.
[12:49:09] <BryanRuiz> is there a way to make something go transparent or white instead of fadeout?
[12:49:15] <BillCriswell> salientKnight: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[12:49:16] <salientKnight> debounce?
[12:49:32] <salientKnight> thanks reading
[12:50:01] <BillCriswell> salientKnight: The name doesn't make sense to me either but I can remember it.
[12:50:08] <BillCriswell> So I guess that's good.
[12:50:14] <kripster> so any ideas guys?
[12:50:23] <salientKnight> nice thanks!
[12:50:28] <salientKnight> BillCriswell++
[12:50:44] <BillCriswell> salientKnight: Hell yeah. I might have like... 3 internet points now.
[12:51:52] <kripster> do i need to refresh the radio button after unchecking???
[12:52:03] <BillCriswell> I have an incredible ability to be sidetracked.
[12:52:09] <BillCriswell> It's almost impressive.
[12:52:21] <BillCriswell> Like no matter how important it is, I will probably forget about it.
[12:52:47] <salientKnight> :)
[12:53:32] <guy> "this" in this context refers to the object rather than the selected element, is there a way to obtain the original reference? https://gist.github.com/b7fb656c037f27d02a4e
[12:58:47] <BillCriswell> guy: I might be a bit out of my league here but are you trying to create a plugin?
[12:59:04] <guy> namespace a plugin
[12:59:44] <nerk> is there any way to inject script into the body that will get executed (jquery.mobile) after an ajax page load
[13:01:12] <kripster> so any idea why this works here http://jsfiddle.net/2ecHH/8/ but when i am running thru jquery mobile in chrome it doesn't?
[13:01:24] <nerk> guy, usually ppl use $(this).each(function() { }); to target the selected element
[13:01:32] <nerk> in plugin architecture
[13:01:51] <guy> right. again. I am trying to namespace the plugin.
[13:02:05] <guy> $('foo').myNamespace.myPlugin
[13:02:28] <nerk> i see, with ay
[13:02:29] <nerk> hrrm
[13:02:31] <nerk> good question
[13:03:10] <kripster> ok if i remove jquery mobile then it works, is there an issue with jquery 1.8.2 and jquery mobile 1.2.0????
[13:03:52] <LBo> I'm having some troubles with jquery mobile
[13:03:59] <firstclassfunc> too bad
[13:04:02] <LBo> I'm using a listview
[13:04:26] <LBo> But I can't click a link in the listview if I'm on that specific page
[13:04:34] <LBo> Well, I can click on it
[13:04:38] <LBo> But it won't activate
[13:04:49] <LBo> Is there a way to disable that behaviour?
[13:05:04] <kripster> LBo have you had issues with unchecking radio buttons?
[13:05:50] <LBo> kripster: no, not that I know of :)
[13:06:51] <kripster> crap, can you look at my running code and give any ideas how to get it working in jquery mobile??http://jsfiddle.net/2ecHH/8/
[13:07:07] <kripster> its works fine when jquery mobile is not used
[13:07:45] <nerk> guy: this works
[13:07:46] <nerk> http://jsfiddle.net/ybcjy/
[13:08:02] <nerk> your namespace should be defined as a function that returns this
[13:08:08] <nerk> then you can chain off it
[13:09:51] <nerk> remember that about jquery and plugins.. they usually always return this.. so they can continue to chain
[13:09:59] <nerk> this being the main selector
[13:13:19] <mboro> I'm inserting two script tags in my HTML using a string. the first script tag, has a `src` attribute, the next one depends on the first one. I tried to do: section.$el.filter('script').each(function(){ $.globalEval(this.text || this.textContent || this.innerHTML || ''); }); but that fires both script tags right away. how do I wait for the first one?
[13:13:55] <guy> nerk: in your example, this does not refer to body
[13:15:05] <NoiseEee> http://requirejs.org/ @ mboro
[13:15:53] <guy> nerk: Though you were close to be right, https://gist.github.com/b0436c510ab1e2aaef42
[13:16:05] <guy> the only problem is that this requires executing the namespace
[13:16:18] <mboro> NoiseEee: so you think I should extract the script tags from the HTML string and run them through requireJS?
[13:16:45] <nerk> ok, sorry.. it's been a while since I have mucked with plugin architecture
[13:16:58] <nerk> but glad, it helped you somewhat
[13:17:32] <NoiseEee> mboro: you can either use that or use the load event and load the 2nd after the first; don't just insert string into your doc like "<script src='whatever.js'></script><script src='next.js'></script>"
[13:17:50] <mboro> NoiseEee: roger, thx a lot
[13:18:32] <guy> nerk: Yes, it did. Thank you.
[13:18:54] <BillCriswell> ?deferreds
[13:18:54] <bot-t> Read this for getting started with deferreds: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[13:19:39] <nerk> god, I am really starting to hate phonegap with jquery.mobile.
[13:19:44] <nerk> three is always some wall I hit
[13:19:50] <nerk> there
[13:20:16] <R00tk3y> nerk, three times already??
[13:20:24] <R00tk3y> You got stuck three times?
[13:20:40] <nerk> troll behaviour fail. sorry. lame
[13:20:57] <R00tk3y> k
[13:21:11] <kripster> nerk you had any issues with jquery mobile in regards to radio buttons?
[13:21:17] <nerk> nah
[13:21:25] <nerk> it's all related to ajax stuff
[13:21:30] <firstclassfunc> underscore.js has a function toArray and says "useful for transmuting the arguments object" -- why would you transmute the arguments obj?
[13:21:52] <kripster> so you would know how to uncheck a radio button on the click of a button?
[13:22:22] <BillCriswell> I don't even know what transmute means lol.
[13:22:40] <nerk> first issue was that phonegap'd blackberry will not work with jquery.mobile ajax and/or $.getJSON().. so I finally solved that with a custom XHR solution, but now I need some scripts to dynamically inject into a view and run.. but of course.. that encounters the issue with BB ;/
[13:24:24] <abelitoPito> ummm
[13:24:34] <djQuery> well back to trying to get syncha touch running on linux
[13:25:07] <nerk> and the reason for this, was that one of my $.getJSON scripts use to redirect through a third - party, that works fine in a head script injection with callback, but of course.. XHR security kicked in.. so I had to remove the redirect.  which leads me to trying to inject it into a view dynamically..  I would just statically include it.. but I need dynamic parameters passed to this script.
[13:25:45] <Heather_> Hmm I'm not able to change the active class http://pastebin.com/xCpt9Hhf what am I doing wrong?
[13:25:56] <w00tner> In theory
[13:26:39] <w00tner>  If i get 3 divs positicion using  var posicion = elemento.position(); alert( "left: " + posicion.left + ", top: " + posicion.top );
[13:27:22] <w00tner> i want to retrieve 3 elements.. is there anyway to  clone them to a canvas clong the html() and using position information for x and y positionin for each element
[13:27:54] <BillCriswell> Heather_: This looks fine. Any error in the console?
[13:28:22] <kripster> ahhh this is driving me nuts
[13:28:32] <BillCriswell> I mean.. The first li already have an active class so you're reapplying the active class to it again with your code.
[13:29:15] <Heather_> yes but the "starting point" is another li so the active is on that li and not the first one
[13:29:24] <abelitoPito> hey se puede preguntar algo en españo
[13:29:37] <abelitoPito> o es que to es en ingle
[13:30:05] <Heather_> no error in the console and the rest of the script behaves as it should hmm
[13:30:41] <BillCriswell> Heather_: http://jsbin.com/ojocat/1/edit
[13:31:05] <abelitoPito> al parecer si
[13:31:12] <abelitoPito> toy perdio como un zapato
[13:31:24] <BillCriswell> Your JavaScript, with the HTML you provided would not change anything ( to the user ).
[13:32:29] <BD--> ok, i'm having a bit of a crysis here... i thought js was all about calling things asynchronously and being non-blocking... but... js is by definition single-threaded/synchronous ? o.O
[13:33:08] <BD--> on the other hand, making ajax calls *is* asynchronous ? so somehow it *does* support it ?
[13:33:20] <kripster> as i am unable to uncheck a radio button in jquery is there anyway to rest the page back to the onload display??
[13:34:04] <djQuery> kripster, sure you can
[13:34:08] <NoiseEee> kripster: you can't uncheck a radio button, period.  you can only select another.   your alternatives are to add a 'right click' modifier, or a completely new element that can be clicked/pressed/etc to 'clear radio buttons'
[13:34:38] <NoiseEee> kripster: if you're saying you can't use JS/jquery to uncheck a radio button, then you're incorrect
[13:35:13] <kripster> i can uncheck a radio button, i'm doing it here http://jsfiddle.net/2ecHH/8/, when i use jquery mobile then it doesn't let me
[13:36:48] <kripster> any ideas noisee?
[13:36:56] <NoiseEee> nope
[13:37:01] <kripster> great lol
[13:37:16] <djQuery> kripster, that link dont work
[13:37:32] <djQuery> thought removeAttr would have unchecked them
[13:37:53] <djQuery> ahh it will
[13:37:57] <kripster> jquery its http://jsfiddle.net/2ecHH/8/
[13:38:41] <djQuery> kripster, have you tried removeProp?
[13:39:49] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: That's interesting. I wonder why you can't clear it once it's checked.
[13:41:34] <kripster> lemme try
[13:41:49] <BillCriswell> Oh wait you can.
[13:42:10] <BillCriswell> removeProp('checked') worked.
[13:42:55] <BillCriswell> .prop('checked', false); worked as well.
[13:43:05] <Heather_> is there a way to see if there is a matched element like a boolean?
[13:43:15] <w00tner> abelito pito rascame un huevito
[13:43:28] <djQuery> checked and selected are some of those that you have to add them or remove them to get it to work
[13:43:43] <BillCriswell> Heather_: $('.foo').length would be falsy.
[13:43:51] <BillCriswell> falsey*
[13:43:53] <djQuery> <input type="radio" checked>
[13:44:07] * black_warlock oksushi its supersukkio !
[13:44:33] <Heather_> ok ty
[13:44:34] <kripster> i am trying it but it doesn't work
[13:45:41] <ktom49> is it possible to have a Backbone Collection as a property of a model?
[13:46:24] <defaultro_> shoky: the culprit was the html from callback. It's undefined in chrome while good in firefox. I'll troubleshoot it later
[13:46:31] <kripster> djquery, bill, it seems to be an issue with jquery mobile, these all work if i just use jquery by itself
[13:49:46] <kripster> yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[13:49:49] <kripster> i got it
[13:49:59] <joAnne> Hi. Could you please recommend me a good full content, responsive and touch enabled slider. I need to have html pages in full screen ( with several types of content) sliding...
[13:50:01] <kripster> i had to use the .checkboxradio("refresh");
[13:50:15] <kripster> you learn something new every day
[13:51:01] <djQuery> so $('input:radio').removeProp('checked').checkboxradio('refresh')
[13:51:17] <kripster> correct
[13:52:19] <kripster> thanks guys
[13:52:23] <djQuery> kripster, is this only for a mobile site?
[13:54:00] <djQuery> lol in the example on jquerymobile they are using attr instead of prop
[13:54:28] <BillCriswell> joAnne: FlexSlider, Bootstrap's Carousel.
[13:54:43] <BillCriswell> joAnne: That , should probably be an "or"
[13:54:49] <joAnne> BillCriswell, thank you very much.
[13:55:11] <BillCriswell> joAnne: No problem!
[13:55:16] <joAnne> :)
[13:56:32] <katsh> How can i get which button ('ok', 'cancel') was clicked from a file upload dialog?
[13:58:37] <NoiseEee> a file upload dialog?
[13:59:07] <katsh> Yes
[13:59:26] <katsh> The window that pops up on a file selection form
[13:59:27] <NoiseEee> what is a file upload dialog
[13:59:29] <NoiseEee> oh.
[13:59:35] <BillCriswell> katsh: I don't believe there's a way to tell.
[13:59:45] <katsh> =(
[13:59:50] <NoiseEee> katsh: presumably the 'change' event of said input would fire
[14:00:04] <BillCriswell> You can tell when someone selected a file, but not when someone clicked cancel ( since nothing changed ).
[14:00:09] <katsh> But there's no way to tell which button was clicked?
[14:00:26] <katsh> Ideally id like to start the upload when they click ok, as opposed to clicking OK, then clicking an 'upload' button after
[14:00:40] <NoiseEee> katsh: then the change event will fire.
[14:00:46] <katsh> but id need to detect if they clicked ok, or cancel / x'd out
[14:00:52] <NoiseEee> no you wouldn't
[14:00:57] <NoiseEee> onchange = startXHRupload
[14:00:58] <BillCriswell> katsh: The change event doesn't fire unless they choose a file.
[14:01:06] <katsh> oh
[14:01:11] <katsh> thanks all
[14:02:03] <ktom49> is there a good place besides #documentcloud to get help with Backbone.js?
[14:06:09] <Eduard_Munteanu> Does JQuery provide any file upload thingy, or should I get some third party script?
[14:06:57] <firstclassfunc> I need a validation library, none of the $("#myForm").validate({inputID1:"Error!... You must enter", inputID2:"OOPS!..."}); bullshit
[14:07:06] <firstclassfunc> I want to call the validators directly
[14:07:22] <meisth0th> hello all
[14:07:47] <meisth0th> i am looking for a jquery plugin that i can use instead of marquee block in sidebar, a vertical slider like thingy
[14:07:55] <BillCriswell> welcome.
[14:08:05] <meisth0th> i hope this is right place to ask.
[14:08:12] <dandaman> https://gist.github.com/4219943 so lines 1-5 produce an alert, 6-8 do not produce the alert, the request comes back with a status of 200, any idea why? seems like its not interpretting the request as a success
[14:09:24] <meisth0th> i think http://bxslider.com/examples/vertical-slideshow is good enough, thanks anyways :)
[14:11:53] <Jzarecta> hi I am a n00b of jquery and havent had good experiences
[14:12:01] <Jzarecta> I wonder if I am doing this the wrong way
[14:13:29] <Jzarecta> I have tried using some jquery-ui effect but failed misserably
[14:14:43] <Jzarecta> I wonder how many js files I need to include in my html
[14:18:08] <BillCriswell> What's a common gotcha with slideToggle?
[14:18:21] <BillCriswell> I keep clicking it... and it hides for a second, then comes right back.
[14:18:33] <BillCriswell> Yes, if I do $el.hide(); it hides it. So weird.
[14:20:16] <BillCriswell> Yet* not yes.
[14:24:06] <davoclavo> Jzarecta: could you be more specific? what effect are you trying to archieve?
[14:24:29] <Jzarecta> actually no, I want to learn in general not just fix a specific bug
[14:25:08] <Jzarecta> how does JQuery works that I cant just paste the demo code and get the effect I am looking for
[14:27:22] <NoiseEee> Jzarecta: are you including the jquery library?
[14:27:46] <Jzarecta> NoiseEee: yes I include jquery-1.8.2-min.js
[14:28:02] <guy> Here is a very simple jQuery library extension (plugin). https://github.com/gajus/toggle-element How would you suggest targeting multiple targets, as opposed to just one? (The problem is obviously keeping the reference @ localStorage)
[14:28:16] <NoiseEee> Jzarecta: then i don't know.  try jsfiddle
[14:28:16] <Jzarecta> I wonder how many js files I need to include in my html?
[14:28:32] <Jzarecta> NoiseEee: well JSfiddle is not to deploy
[14:28:49] <NoiseEee> Jzarecta: no but it shows you that things work / do not work.
[14:28:58] <NoiseEee> Jzarecta: if they work on JSfiddle and not your site, you've got some other code messing
[14:29:02] <Jzarecta> NoiseEee: so I want to know how to deploy
[14:29:07] <Jzarecta> on my page
[14:29:14] <NoiseEee> include it on your page, done!
[14:29:17] <Jzarecta> umm...
[14:29:22] <Jzarecta> include what?
[14:29:25] <NoiseEee> jquery
[14:29:28] <Jzarecta> I did
[14:29:34] <NoiseEee> and what specific problem are you having
[14:29:35] <Jzarecta> but is it only 1 file
[14:29:41] <Jzarecta> well it doesnt run
[14:29:57] <Jzarecta> I end up inclluding 10 different js and none of them work
[14:30:26] <Jzarecta> the  code in itself was only 3lines
[14:30:28] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Have fun bud.
[14:30:30] <NoiseEee> why are you calling 10 js files?  this is the purpose of jsfiddle.  you take your code thats 'not working', reduce it to an example that you can put on a fiddle, and either get it to work or not
[14:30:43] <NoiseEee> Jzarecta: nobody here has a crystal ball or ESP.
[14:31:01] <grafi> I do
[14:31:04] <grafi> :o
[14:31:06] <Jzarecta> NoiseEee: but you configure JQuery before, I assume
[14:31:15] <Jzarecta> so what would be the steps
[14:31:28] <ogk1000> anyone know of a lightweight JS script to rotate something in place, that works on all browsers?
[14:31:45] <BillCriswell> ALL browsers? You brave man.
[14:32:14] <ogk1000> or at least most? lol
[14:32:46] <NoiseEee> Jzarecta: there is nothing to figure in jquery.
[14:32:47] <ogk1000> trying to make a cool preloader but its too large on file size
[14:33:46] <BillCriswell> ogk1000: A gif won't cut it?
[14:34:37] <ogk1000> 1 mb file
[14:34:44] <ogk1000> it needs to be png cause it has some transparency
[14:34:53] <ogk1000> but its 50kb so I dont want 25 frames of it :/
[14:34:57] <grafi> oO
[14:35:06] <grafi> sounds crazy ogk1000
[14:35:12] <ogk1000> ill show ya if u want its dope 1 sec
[14:36:17] <ogk1000> http://ogkdev.com/imf/test.jpg
[14:36:33] <ogk1000> and sorta what im going for: http://ogkdev.com/imf/test.gif
[14:37:03] <mads-> Can anyone tell me what is wrong with this: http://ideone.com/9Nid9X ?
[14:37:24] <mads-> I don't get any response when clicking on my buttons named submitComment
[14:37:35] <Pilate> do you get an alert?
[14:37:53] <ogk1000> anyone used/recommend http://www.jstween.org/?
[14:38:08] <mads-> Pilate, the first one, yeah - the one where I check that I actually call the function
[14:38:25] <mads-> But the one inside the $('input....) - no
[14:38:32] <Pilate> have you checked that your selector actually selects elements?
[14:39:39] <mads-> How do I do that? I checked in the chrome developer console, and there it gave me the correct ones - but how do I make the check here?
[14:40:21] <Pilate> after your first alert, just do something like: console.log($('input[name="submitComment"]'))
[14:42:25] <mads-> Looks empty. Could it be it's because I throw those input fields in from javascript just before I call the selector?
[14:45:04] <mads-> I think I shot myself in the foot doing this half normal javascript and half jquery
[14:45:43] <Pilate> if the elements exist in the DOM when you try to make the query, then your query is wrong
[14:48:44] <joAnne> BillCriswell, i'm sorry, could you please give me a link for the  Bootstrap's Carousel. I have more than one instance o the same name and I am not sure if is the correct one.
[14:49:09] <BillCriswell> joAnne: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel
[14:49:16] <mads-> Pilate, if they _dont_ exists, right?
[14:49:28] <joAnne> ahh that's the one, Thank you BillCriswell !
[14:49:35] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[14:49:56] <mads-> I just swapped selector.click with selector.live('click',..). This way I don't have to change all my javascript doing .innerHTML
[14:50:43] <Pilate> thats certainly one way mads-, did it work?
[14:51:35] <mads-> it did :)
[14:52:07] <mads-> But thank you. I thought I was doing some awfully wrong. I guess it's not the prettiest solution I made, but at least it's working now
[14:53:23] <guy> anyone?
[14:55:51] <BillCriswell> guy: Don't you want this.each(function(){ }); to target more than one?
[14:56:20] <BillCriswell> guy: This is what I used when I was making plugins. Hopefully it's useful to you as well: http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[14:56:32] <guy> BillCriswell: "this" is already targeting more thae one. Do you mean if I want to target them independently? No.
[15:03:05] <BabySuperman> I am doing $.getJSON('some url', function(data) -- and its returning a 301 redirect error.  Whenever I type the same url in the browser, it shows up fine...
[15:03:19] <davidwongca1> Hi, I'm wondering if I can use jQuery to get the table row that a user is currently selecting
[15:10:34] <coldhead> davidwongca1: http://jsfiddle.net/eRy7A/
[15:10:40] <coldhead> doesn't work for me on select
[15:10:40] <coldhead> only click :(
[15:11:12] <davidwongca1> coldhead: I meant click. That's great, thanks.
[15:11:47] <davidwongca1> davidwongca1: I could probably then get the selected text using the class? I need a delete action to delete a highlighted user.
[15:12:48] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/eRy7A/1/
[15:18:30] <Bheam> yo
[15:19:00] <Bheam> so if i have a $(function() {}); and i add stuff to the dom, how can i make another hook when everything is loaded again?
[15:19:29] <oojacoboo> where can I get an explanation of the states of the deferreds with $.ajax?
[15:19:38] <davidwongca1> coldhead: Thanks.
[15:19:42] <oojacoboo> like… .done() vs .success()
[15:19:59] <oojacoboo> the api docs don't really explain this from what I see
[15:20:41] <systemfault> oojacoboo: There's done/fail/always and progress
[15:20:53] <oojacoboo> systemfault: and each one fires when?
[15:21:00] <oojacoboo> that's what I want… detailed info on that
[15:21:17] <oojacoboo> systemfault: there isn't .success()?
[15:21:18] <systemfault> oojacoboo: done = success, fail = failure, always = either success or failure
[15:21:26] <oojacoboo> mm
[15:21:34] <gnarf> oojacoboo: use .done() --- .success is deprecated
[15:21:35] <systemfault> oojacoboo: I think it's a deprecated alias for $.ajax
[15:21:41] <systemfault> Err
[15:21:41] <oojacoboo> For convenience and consistency with the callback names used by $.ajax(), jqXHR also provides .error(), .success(), and .complete() methods.
[15:21:46] <systemfault> $.ajax.done
[15:21:59] <oojacoboo> gnarf: gotcha
[15:22:09] <misteroneill> error = fail, success = fail, complete = always
[15:22:11] <gnarf> oojacoboo: For deprecated API jqXHR also provided....
[15:22:12] <oojacoboo> thanks guys
[15:22:18] <misteroneill> oops
[15:22:20] <gnarf> ;)
[15:22:26] <misteroneill> success = done :)
[15:22:27] <oojacoboo> gnarf: might someone update the docs :)
[15:22:27] <systemfault>  The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callbacks will be deprecated in jQuery 1.8. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead.
[15:22:40] <systemfault> It's written on the $.ajax page
[15:22:42] <gnarf> oojacoboo: already been done, api docs should launch an update soon
[15:22:58] <oojacoboo> cool
[15:24:40] <awc737> does anyone know if there is a plugin (or a way) to allow my app users to type in languages other than their keyboard's?
[15:24:40] <cprodigy29> Is there a channel for Responsive Web Development?
[15:24:48] <tw2113> #css ?
[15:24:53] <awc737> like an onscreen keyboard with language options?
[15:25:16] <danzik17> gnarf: just out of curiosity, what's the benefit of using this kind of constructor pattern? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L36-L39
[15:25:28] <cprodigy29> tw2113: thanks
[15:25:32] <gnarf> awc737: yeah, teach them to enable another keyboard input -- if you just want some glyphs, you could easily write something that would add a letter to an input
[15:26:14] <awc737> enable another keyboard input? if you don't have that keyboard?
[15:26:20] <gnarf> danzik17: implicit "new" on every call
[15:26:50] <gnarf> yup
[15:26:51] <danzik17> gnarf: ah ok, so pretty much the same thing as doing an instanceof check - got it
[15:26:59] <gnarf> like on mac os x i just enable the other keyboard
[15:27:25] <gnarf> 낦
[15:27:36] <gnarf> suddenly i can type korean
[15:27:40] <gnarf> no clue what it was
[15:27:44] <gnarf> :)
[15:28:30] <oojacoboo> I'm assuming .done and .fail callbacks return "data"?
[15:28:42] <systemfault> oojacoboo: Right.
[15:28:43] <awc737> gnarf is that an onscreen keyboard?
[15:28:58] <gnarf> awc737: most every OS has an internationalization layer to map your keyboard
[15:29:31] <gnarf> and no, it was just me typing "narf" 낦
[15:29:43] <gnarf> but anyway
[15:29:46] <gnarf> way off topic
[15:29:56] <awc737> how do you know what your english keyboard is going to map once you set it to chinese... that makes no sense
[15:29:57] <gnarf> what do you ACTUALLY want to do
[15:30:14] <awc737> onscreen keyboard makes sense because the buttons are different
[15:31:02] <gnarf> awc737: im not aware of any onscreen keyboard javascript plugins, but i bet you one exists, have you tried google?  OS'es (like phones) have internationalization layers to provide these as well
[15:31:34] <awc737> yeah this was all I found so far, looks mediocre http://www.ajaxblender.com/jquery-virtual-keyboard.html
[15:31:56] <gnarf> http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/jquery-screen-keyboard-plugin/
[15:32:15] <gnarf> but like - usually if they want to type in another language, they know how to type it
[15:32:29] <gnarf> whats the use case?
[15:32:32] <awc737> haha thats true
[15:32:44] <awc737> so for example we have a repair manual in english and spanish
[15:32:51] <awc737> I want that as one "record", but with an english file with an english title, and a spanish file with a spanish title
[15:33:17] <awc737> So someone at our US location can upload the documents for both languages, but maybe needs to type in that language to fill the Title field
[15:33:31] <gnarf> copy and paste it from the document surely seems better right?
[15:33:54] <awc737> lol yeah... I'm just trying to cover every possible imaginable aspect
[15:34:14] <gnarf> utf-8 is utf-8 🎉
[15:34:44] <awc737> so there is also this: http://mottie.github.com/Keyboard/
[15:34:49] <awc737> but I don't understand how that is multilingual
[15:34:56] <awc737> the international bit looks just like english
[15:35:03] <gnarf> awc737: let your users worry about their keyboards or their copy paste skills
[15:35:33] <gnarf> providing an on screen keyboard won't make their lives any easier
[15:35:43] <awc737> lol good point
[15:35:46] <gnarf> you try typing by clicking
[15:36:22] <gnarf> danzik17: yeah, its just organized that way for some reason way long ago
[15:36:42] <gnarf> danzik17: maybe resig has a blog post about it
[15:37:06] <danzik17> gnarf: well i noticed the same pattern was re-used in the re-written Tween stuff - was just wondering if there was something i was missing beyond not requiring "new"
[15:37:21] <gnarf> danzik17: I duplicated what I knew
[15:37:31] <danzik17> gnarf: fair enough :)
[15:39:10] <gnarf> though its probably a section where bytes could be removed
[15:40:03] <gnarf> danzik17: might want to ask about it in -dev -- DaveMethvin may know the answer, and if noone does, gibson or mikesherov might be willing to do the research
[15:40:10] <danzik17> maybe in tween - ill bet someone somewhere is using jQuery.fn.init directly for whatever reason =P
[15:41:55] <gnarf> danzik17: aside from that, hows the new effects.js
[15:42:06] <gnarf> understandable?
[15:42:28] <danzik17> gnarf: i don't use effects a ton, but the .prefilters are awesome - i <3 that concept
[15:42:45] <gnarf> yeah, thanks jaubourg/ajax1.5
[15:42:46] <danzik17> there's been a couple questions in here that previously woulda been pretty hackish - using a prefilter it was like a 5 line deal
[15:43:41] <gnarf> promises make it pretty awesome too because you can pipe an animation onto itself
[15:43:47] <FunnyLookinHat> Can you serialize two jQ selectors at the same time ?  i.e. I have $myBox and $myColors and want to serialize them on the same line
[15:43:53] <FunnyLookinHat> well - the inputs within them.
[15:43:53] <acidjazz> i have a huge map div inside another div.. i want it to be pannable.. any suggestions?
[15:44:01] <gnarf> $myBox.add($myColors).serialize()
[15:44:32] <gnarf> acidjazz: sounds like a dragable
[15:45:14] <FunnyLookinHat> gnarf, oh nice
[15:45:14] <FunnyLookinHat> thx
[15:45:22] <gnarf> ?add @FunnyLookinHat
[15:45:23] <bot-t> FunnyLookinHat, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[15:45:43] <kripster> can someone tell me how to collapse a div on the click of a button
[15:46:04] <danzik17> gnarf: that was one thing i noticed - the only way that i saw to get at the animation promise was via a prefilter.  it's understandable since you can't change the return value at this point
[15:46:17] <gnarf> danzik17: you can
[15:46:19] <gnarf> danzik17:  ;)
[15:46:27] <acidjazz> gnarf: what do you suggest
[15:46:32] <gnarf> danzik17: anim.pipe(...).promise(anim)
[15:46:43] <gnarf> it overwrites the done/fail/progress methods
[15:46:46] <BabySuperman> I am doing $.getJSON('some url', function(data) -- and its returning a 301 redirect error.  Whenever I type the same url in the browser, it shows up fine...    How can I replicate the browser get vs jquery get?
[15:47:04] <Fallout2man> How do I find where a hashchange event is being triggered from?
[15:47:57] <Fallout2man> I've got a "Menu" feature in my App that lets the user navigate to different portions of a multi-page template. Clicking to navigate works fine but when you close the menu something keeps basically hitting the back button and returning the user to where they started.
[15:48:00] <gnarf> danzik17: also - you can jQuery.Animation( elem, props, opts )
[15:48:18] <gnarf> danzik17: to get the promise directly, it avoids the queue
[15:48:26] <Fallout2man> Debugging so far just tells me that it's a "hash change" and was not triggered by a link, but I don't have any info on what where or how this event is being generated.
[15:48:36] <Fallout2man> What do I do to find that out? Thanks!
[15:48:54] <danzik17> gnarf: how do you get at that via $().animate though?  there's no pipe on there
[15:50:09] <gnarf> danzik17: you don't - the .fn.animate is kinda locked down
[15:50:34] <gnarf> danzik17: you could still catch the promise in the 'start' callback, but its too late to edit it
[15:50:47] <gnarf> the handlers have already been attached by then
[15:50:56] <gnarf> prefilters happen before the handlers get attached
[15:51:11] <gnarf> actually
[15:51:13] <gnarf> maybe start works
[15:51:46] <gnarf> yup, start works
[15:51:47] <gnarf> 🎉
[15:51:51] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L151
[15:52:52] <danzik17> ah good point, it's passed the animation - that'd work
[15:53:45] <gnarf> danzik17: and if you override the promise methods: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L164 gets the rest of the callbacks bound to your new promise
[15:54:04] <Fallout2man> No one here familiar with mobile hash change stuff? :-/
[15:54:42] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/y39QP/12/ how do i get this to work? I just want to be able to select a text input and then when i hit a number button it will get the ccurrent value and add it's own digit
[15:54:43] <gnarf> Fallout2man: hash change could be triggered by window.location, user back/forward buttons/swiping or pushState/popState
[15:55:55] <gnarf> veQue: i warn you, its going to be a pain to get that UI to work well :)
[15:55:58] <Fallout2man> gnarf: Swipe or button press? Is this something auto-enhanced into the page?
[15:56:03] <gnarf> veQue: i just fought with that myself
[15:56:07] <veQue> gnarf: why?
[15:56:08] <acidjazz> i have a 4000px by 4000px div inside of a 640x640 div and i want the 4000x400 be able to be pannable.. any suggestions?
[15:56:14] <Fallout2man> gnarf: Because my problem is that I can't find any code I've written that would do this.
[15:56:18] <gnarf> Fallout2man: like standard user navigation buttons, back forward etc
[15:56:35] <Fallout2man> gnarf: Oh, none of those. I use a stripped down build of mobile without most of the widgets.
[15:56:46] <Fallout2man> I mostly just wanted the utilities, basic page templating and transitions.
[15:56:48] <wroathe> acidjazz: overflow: scroll
[15:57:09] <gnarf> Fallout2man: the browser still has a back button tho?
[15:57:16] <veQue> gnarf: it almost seems as though i can only change values of ids and not classes
[15:57:30] <veQue> anyone able to help?
[15:57:33] <Fallout2man> gnarf: Fortunately my hand can't press it without me knowing. It hasn't quite gotten posessed...yet!
[15:57:45] <veQue> help would be much appreciated
[15:57:48] <veQue> =)
[15:57:49] <Fallout2man> Unfortunately when it does I'll have to go kill Jessica Alba
[15:57:53] <Fallout2man> man been putting that off forever
[15:58:02] <gnarf> veQue: have you tried <input type="number"> and allowing the actual keyboard to kick in?
[15:58:50] <veQue> gnarf: i've not tried this and i dont really see how that would help? will that allow me to use an onscreen keyboard?
[15:59:14] <acidjazz> wroathe: really? ooo
[15:59:38] <veQue> i can already use type="Tel" and the numpad kicks in (via phonegap) but for some reason that wont even allow me to enter numbers
[15:59:44] <veQue> android
[15:59:53] <veQue> which is weird
[16:00:13] <veQue> cause it works fine when not on android emulator
[16:00:44] <veQue> maybe i'll try #javascript
[16:00:45] <gnarf> i don't do enough mobile development to be very useful here, and sadly not many people here do
[16:00:47] <acidjazz> wroathe: no dood i mean you click your mouse on it and drag your mouse around
[16:01:22] <misteroneill> acidjazz: overflow scroll is the quick and easy way to do it, but if you mean like google maps panning, then maybe try something like jquery ui draggable. i built a ui like that last year, but i ended up doing a custom thing. there's a bit of math involved, but… that's just how it is :)
[16:01:42] <gnarf> acidjazz: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/
[16:08:15] <MistuhKurtz> acidjazz, surely there is a plugin that you could drop in pretty quickly that pans based on mouse position
[16:13:19] <acidjazz> MistuhKurtz: cant find one.. writing one
[16:13:51] <TelFiRE> How do you usually deal with the fact that in order to be on top of eachother, two elements need to be positioned absolutely but then they don't affect the height of the document, how can I make stuff under it "clear" it (although I know it's not technically "clearing")
[16:14:42] <MistuhKurtz> interesting acidjazz, it seems like it would be a common enough scenario..
[16:15:39] <gnarf> TelFiRE: fixed height or dynamic height?
[16:16:04] <gnarf> TelFiRE: if its fixed, just set a height on a container
[16:16:24] <TelFiRE> dynamic
[16:16:28] <gnarf> but if you're using absolute, it doesn't have flow
[16:17:02] <rakm> does jquery have a way to really stupidly just get the html contents of a webpage?
[16:18:02] <rakm> something like Net::HTTP.get(url)
[16:18:07] <rakm> in ruby
[16:18:10] <gnarf> TelFiRE: make the thing that needs the flow be a relative container of the "floating over" absoulte maybe?
[16:18:13] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/y39QP/12/ how do i get this to work? I just want to be able to select a text input and then when i hit a number button it will get the ccurrent value and add it's own digit
[16:18:19] <bartmax> anyone using sublime2 knows how to save some code blocks into something reusable to paste in a demo? like ssanderson does here: http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Knockoutjs
[16:18:24] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, two dynamically sized elements need to be on top of each other? or their container is what's dynamically sized?
[16:18:30] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/y39QP/14/ this only works for an id not dynamically
[16:19:00] <gnarf> arschmitz: you here?
[16:19:28] <acidjazz> how do i detect if the mouse click is held down during a mousemove event
[16:19:29] <gnarf> arschmitz: you know of any good keypad demos to answer veQue's question?
[16:19:57] <veQue> gnarf: every keypad demo ive seen is just one text input
[16:19:58] <gnarf> acidjazz: you bind mousemove on element mousedown and unbind on document mouseup
[16:20:00] <warbler> I need this website to load faster: http://www.pointstackers.com/ would any of you be capable of performing such a task, possible full redesign as well, and if so give me your ideas and your rates to pointstackers@gmail.com please & thanks!
[16:22:06] <MistuhKurtz> acidjazz, as long as mouseup hasn't fired then they've been holding the click
[16:22:27] <MistuhKurtz> oh darn I'm late to all of your questions
[16:22:28] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[16:23:53] <TelFiRE> MistuhKurtz: well the height of container is 0 because of the absoluteness
[16:25:00] <charliebone> hey folks, i have a question. on a website i am working on, there is a div that should have an image as a background only if that image exists, and otherwise not have a background image.  the problem is that because the images are served by a separate CDN, i cannot test via ajax / js whether the image exists or not (same-origin policy).
[16:25:08] <charliebone> this may be a stupid question, but is there a way to bind some kind of error handler to the css 'background-image' property? using an error handler bound to that div does not seem to catch the error (404) when the browser attempts to load the image as the div background.
[16:26:18] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, I mean, which elements are -supposed- to be dynamic in size?
[16:26:25] <MistuhKurtz> the elements layered over one another? or their container?
[16:27:19] <MistuhKurtz> charliebone, sounds like you're describing default browser behaviour iirc
[16:27:32] <MistuhKurtz> if referencing a background image that doesn't exist, it just doesn't show a background image
[16:27:33] <TelFiRE> MistuhKurtz: on my desktop view they are set height, but the mobile view is 100% width so it will stretch with land/portrait so the height of the container needs to be as tall as what it contains
[16:27:39] <MistuhKurtz> not like an <img /> tag which would show a broken image
[16:27:57] <Led_Zeppelin> is there a gauge widget for jQuery?
[16:28:09] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, not sure how 100% width relates to the height
[16:28:10] <charliebone> MistuhKurtz: this is true. but it just seems unclean to me, as there is an uncaught 404 error
[16:28:24] <TelFiRE> just the fact that it's supposed to be proportionate to the height, but I don't think I can do that
[16:28:25] <acidjazz> you know how browsers you can select an image and drag it off the browser to save it as a file.. any way to disable that?
[16:28:44] <MistuhKurtz> charliebone, would be best to drop the HTTP request altogether if you know the image won't exist. Is that a possibility?
[16:28:55] <arschmitz> gnarf: At dinner now ill take a look when I get home
[16:29:10] <MistuhKurtz> acidjazz, you shouldn't try to prevent users from saving images
[16:29:16] <TelFiRE> I'm just saying that on the desktop view it isn't a problem, I set the height and width exactly. But on the mobile view I don't know what to set the height to because the width is 100%, therefore the content could land at a wide variety of heihgts
[16:29:25] <charliebone> the thing is i dont know if the image exists or not. basically all i know is what the name of the image is and what its url would be if it existed
[16:29:26] <MistuhKurtz> it's just frustrating for the user and doesn't really work, it's easily circumvented
[16:29:54] <acidjazz> MistuhKurtz: i am a grown man
[16:30:00] <acidjazz> MistuhKurtz: you're not my real dad anyways
[16:30:04] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[16:30:17] <acidjazz> MistuhKurtz: also this image is a pannable draggable image.. i need to stop that functionality cuz its breaking it
[16:30:20] <MistuhKurtz> I'll have your mom talk to you then D:
[16:30:33] <TelFiRE> is it just I have to grab the value of the height of the inner element, then set the height of the container?
[16:30:40] <charliebone> my other option is not to use a div background-image and instead just use an image absolutely positioned in the div… but i was hoping there was some slick solution to deal with this case
[16:30:44] <TelFiRE> seems kinda performance-poor but not sure what else there is
[16:31:10] <MistuhKurtz> acidjazz, call event.preventDefault(); on your click handler
[16:31:30] <acidjazz> well the image dragging off is a browser thing
[16:31:39] <acidjazz> i dont even have a click handler
[16:31:44] <acidjazz> i dont think you underestand me
[16:31:58] <veQue> $('[type="text"].currClass') is that proper syntax before i slap myself in the head?
[16:32:13] <MistuhKurtz> if you are scripting a behaviour that happens when your element is clicked, then you have a click handler.
[16:32:41] <MistuhKurtz> or you're right and I misunderstood acidjazz, like I did the first time :P
[16:33:15] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, it seems to me like there is a better solution. could you isolate the problem and throw it up on jsfiddle or something?
[16:34:13] <acidjazz> MistuhKurtz: your solution still sorta works i think
[16:34:23] <awc737> $(lastVariant).clone().data('variant', variantId++).insertAfter(lastVariant);
[16:34:30] <awc737> am I doing that right?
[16:34:40] <awc737> my lastVariant is an element with data-variant="1"
[16:35:17] <awc737> if I change .data('variant', to .attr('id', 'something', it works
[16:35:18] <awc737> before it clones it
[16:35:19] <MistuhKurtz> charliebone, if you can't determine if the image exists server-side, you're going to need to make an HTTP request to check and then a handler based on whether it exists or not, no matter how you choose to implement that. Why not just use the browser's defaults instead of rewriting them (and probably not as efficiently) in javascript?
[16:35:47] <TelFiRE> MistuhKurtz: http://jsfiddle.net/zHfvS/
[16:36:54] <TelFiRE> Better yet http://jsfiddle.net/zHfvS/1/  -- each div "a" should be completely below the last one
[16:36:55] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, I present to you, http://jsfiddle.net/zHfvS/3/
[16:36:56] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[16:37:10] <TelFiRE> That does not work.
[16:37:16] <MistuhKurtz> yeah that was more of a joke than anything
[16:37:24] <TelFiRE> I only put height: 300 to demonstrate
[16:37:26] <MistuhKurtz> but it still highlights my original question, which elements need to be dynamic in height?
[16:37:26] <TelFiRE> I don't know the height
[16:37:38] <TelFiRE> divs b and c
[16:37:43] <TelFiRE> well no
[16:37:45] <TelFiRE> I don't know what you mean
[16:37:46] <TelFiRE> all of them
[16:38:14] <TelFiRE> I'm not sure how else to explain this. If you've ever animated a transition between two objects you've run into it.....
[16:39:10] <TelFiRE> I need "A" to contain "B" and "C"
[16:39:20] <MistuhKurtz> and B and C are variable in height
[16:39:39] <TelFiRE> It's all variable in height, there are no heights set anywhere. the 300 is just so I can show the problem
[16:40:57] <TelFiRE> Here's a better example with no fake heights http://jsfiddle.net/zHfvS/4/
[16:42:03] <awc737> $(lastVariant).clone().data('variant', variantId++).insertAfter(lastVariant);
[16:43:49] <awc737> would that be the right way to modify class="something" data-variant="1"
[16:47:07] <awc737> actually I can make it a string, but increment does not change it
[16:47:07] <awc737> .attr('data-variant', variantId++)
[16:47:40] <TelFiRE> MistuhKurtz: are you still working on it or did you move on? I'm about to leave but wouldn't want to do so just before you present something you've been working on heh
[16:47:50] <TelFiRE> thanks much for having a look either way
[16:48:13] <MistuhKurtz> heh thanks TelFiRE. yeah I think this is something for javascript
[16:48:30] <awc737> nevermind I had to increment first
[16:48:44] <MistuhKurtz> I was writing the js but if you can already figure that part out and need to head out, then farewell :)
[16:48:44] <awc737> but why does: .attr('data-variant', variantId) work
[16:48:48] <TelFiRE> MistuhKurtz: I can just set the height manually with a variable that grabs it, just seemed kinda hacky to me
[16:48:51] <awc737> but .data('variant', variantId) does not work?
[16:49:03] <TelFiRE> but I guess that's just what it is
[16:49:17] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, what i was writing would dynamically find the child with the largest height and set the container's height to that
[16:49:19] <TelFiRE> well let me see what you've got sicne you wrote it :)
[16:49:31] <TelFiRE> ah I see
[16:49:45] <TelFiRE> well I'm actually going to want to force both children to be the same height
[16:49:54] <TelFiRE> but that's still good, I can grab the tallest one and set height on all 3 elements
[16:50:46] <IAmLegend> hey everyone, I've added Quicksand to my website but on Firefox (in particular) the list of images goes vertical for a second and then changes. Any ideas? http://www.ckgd.net/
[16:53:39] <TelFiRE> were you gonna post it
[16:54:03] <MistuhKurtz> yes TelFiRE sorry  here itis
[16:54:10] <TelFiRE> np :) thanks!
[16:54:53] <MistuhKurtz> sorry I didn't realize Math.max() doesn't accept arrays by default (how dumb!) so I dropped in a function John Resig wrote to accomplish that: http://jsfiddle.net/zHfvS/5/
[16:55:56] <TelFiRE> great I'll have a look tomorrw. thanks so much :)
[16:57:08] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, I feel like it could maybe be done a little more elegantly. especially in regards to namespacing the max function, because I gave that no regard
[16:57:17] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, I'll be around tomorrow, too. take care
[16:57:49] <TelFiRE> be really nice if this kind of thing was built into jquery
[16:58:11] <TelFiRE> I can't think of many times I've written any jQuery at all when I didn't need to hack out some solution to this, and none I've found I'm happy with
[16:59:52] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, I expected it to be native, then I expected it to be at least in jquery. neither!
[16:59:58] <MistuhKurtz> I bet it's in underscore.js though
[17:00:44] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, also you don't need to define a function if you're only calculating the max value once. you can just do Math.max.apply(null, childrenHeights);
[17:01:54] <TelFiRE> man this js doesn't make any sense at all to me :s
[17:02:41] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, the js I wrote?
[17:03:30] <TelFiRE> yeah but it's ok, I mean I get it, it just looks crazy compared to the ways of doing I had imagined
[17:03:42] <TelFiRE> probably more efficient too heh
[17:04:02] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/zHfvS/6/
[17:04:05] <shoky> awc737: .data() only reads the data-* attributes the first time its called on the element, and it doesnt write back to the attribute
[17:06:39] <MistuhKurtz> heh yeah TelFiRE,  I've only just recently started to love passing in a function on setter methods
[17:07:31] <MistuhKurtz> that way all of the related code for calculating the height is in the same scope together
[17:07:49] <TelFiRE> I don't know how people come up with this stuff
[17:08:23] <MistuhKurtz> lol yeah a while ago I probably would have been equally puzzled
[17:08:55] <TelFiRE> it makes sense to me to say, get the height of all children, add it to an array, look through the array, find the one with the tallest height, then apply that to the height of the original item... but I could never logic it out to write it that way, if I did it, there would be like 3 functions and the code would be separate
[17:09:11] <MistuhKurtz> but to me this is much more elegant than assigning a bunch of variables and using if/else clauses
[17:09:17] <TelFiRE> of course it is
[17:09:20] <TelFiRE> but I suck
[17:09:30] <TelFiRE> =p
[17:10:08] <TelFiRE> just so I understand what's going on, push just adds it to the array right? Then Math.max.apply picks the tallest one?
[17:10:19] <MistuhKurtz> lol nah you're just learning. like I said, doing it this way is new to me too
[17:10:38] <MistuhKurtz> yes, push adds it the array
[17:10:52] <MistuhKurtz> if you're familiar with PHP, it's the same as $array[] = 'new value';
[17:11:22] <MistuhKurtz> I could have sworn JS worked the same but it threw an error...
[17:12:30] <TelFiRE> I'm just not good with programming in general
[17:12:40] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, Math is the javascript math object
[17:12:52] <TelFiRE> much more of a CSS guy, but considering jQuery is pretty much just messing with CSS, I'm pretty ok with it. Get away from jQuery and into JS and I'm bad
[17:13:03] <MistuhKurtz> max is the math object's max method, but it expects a list of arguments and not an array
[17:13:34] <MistuhKurtz> Apply let's you call a function with an array of arguments instead of a list
[17:13:48] <MistuhKurtz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[17:13:51] <TelFiRE> MistuhKurtz: does this only run once?
[17:14:00] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, correct
[17:14:07] <MistuhKurtz> does it need to run on window resize?
[17:14:07] <TelFiRE> I could throw the whole thing in a window.resize no probs tho?
[17:14:25] <TelFiRE> hey can you have a look at my live page
[17:14:42] <TelFiRE> when I implemented, it is definitely making the height larger, but it's not large enough something must be going bad somewhere
[17:14:46] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/zHfvS/7/
[17:15:08] <MistuhKurtz> that will execute on resize, and the trigger('resize') makes sure it executes at least once on page load
[17:15:36] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, hm it's probably not accomodating for your 'top' values
[17:15:42] <MistuhKurtz> are you positioning based on top or bottom?
[17:16:30] <TelFiRE> MistuhKurtz: well there's no value to it though
[17:16:31] <TelFiRE> it's just top: 0
[17:17:35] <MistuhKurtz> what's your container element that's being sized
[17:17:44] <TelFiRE> so the ".front" div is 396 tall while the container is 302
[17:17:47] <TelFiRE> .views-row
[17:17:59] <TelFiRE> and inside there's .front and .back
[17:19:32] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, it's working correctly for me in chrome
[17:20:12] <MistuhKurtz> each .views-row is sized to 302px which is the height of .back, and .front is 300px
[17:20:40] <TelFiRE> hmmmmm when I put it in the window.resize it started working
[17:20:45] <TelFiRE> odd though ebcause I wasn't resizing... oh well
[17:21:08] <TelFiRE> However, it is a bit glitchy. Sometimes I resize and if I let go at the wrong moment, everything's really short. You seeing any of that? And it jumps around a lot during the resize
[17:21:50] <TelFiRE> it seems to be right when you go from the narrowest desktop view to the mobile view, if you let go right after doing that it stays small
[17:22:02] <TelFiRE> like if you let go while it's animating
[17:22:33] <TelFiRE> I think it's got something to do with the fact that these elements are all CSS-transitioned out, but I need it for the flip thing that happens when you press the question mark
[17:23:20] <Caelum> how would I make a simple dialog that's better than an alert and can hold html, the jquery-ui .dialog ?
[17:24:45] <MistuhKurtz> hm, not sure TelFiRE
[17:24:46] <TelFiRE> hmm yeah the resize event isn't firing until I manually resize, if I reload in mobile mode it never runs... guess I can just copy it all to a document.ready
[17:25:04] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, did you copy my code with the trigger('resize') in it?
[17:25:23] <TelFiRE> hmm no I don't see a trigger in your fiddle
[17:25:28] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/zHfvS/7/
[17:25:31] <MistuhKurtz> use that one
[17:26:55] <TelFiRE> Ah that works better. Still, If I leave my browser at roughly 700 pixels wide, refresh, they do not load correctly. They are better than without the script, but still overlapping eachother
[17:26:57] <awc737> how can I turn "anystring-1" into "anystring-2" ?
[17:28:18] <TelFiRE> MistuhKurtz: well it's ok, still got this mostly licked, I can work out the bugs tomorrow. Thanks so much for your help, very much appreciated :)
[17:28:22] <donburks> ?eval "anystring-1".replace(1,2)
[17:28:30] <bot-t> donburks: No output. (Process Killed)
[17:28:33] <donburks> Bah.
[17:28:35] <MistuhKurtz> sure no problem TelFiRE
[17:28:36] <donburks> But, like that.
[17:29:03] <awc737> starting with a questionmark like that?
[17:29:07] <donburks> No.
[17:29:10] <donburks> That's for the IRC bot.
[17:29:11] <MistuhKurtz> at least the problems are edge cases: pretty sure you're not gonna have somebody dragging their browser back and forth to trigger your CSS media queries :P
[17:29:12] <donburks> Which STB'ed.
[17:29:39] <TelFiRE> MistuhKurtz: well it's not that, when you first initially load the page it does not load right
[17:29:51] <coldhead> Sacrae Theologiae Baccalaureus ?
[17:29:57] <oojacoboo> MistuhKurtz: you've never played browser tetris?
[17:30:16] <awc737> I think I want regex
[17:30:21] <MistuhKurtz> nope oojacoboo? brb
[17:30:26] <coldhead> now you have two problems
[17:30:37] <TelFiRE> but you know what, it actually does on mobile. this might be a chrome bug
[17:30:48] <TelFiRE> which I couldn't care less about, they introduce new bugs every release
[17:30:55] <TelFiRE> and then fix em within the next 2
[17:31:07] <oojacoboo> MistuhKurtz: it's where you create a ton of browser windows and drag them around with all kinds of different sizes, and you fit them together like tetris
[17:31:24] <TelFiRE> ok I really am gonna go now xD peace outz
[17:31:25] <TelFiRE> away
[17:31:36] <oojacoboo> it's what you use to do on windows 3.1 systems for entertainment
[17:31:59] <Caelum> is this the right way to make dialogs: http://jsfiddle.net/JKZan/
[17:32:20] <awc737> how can I turn "anystring-1" into "anystring-2" ?
[17:32:24] <shoky> Caelum: it's one way, yea
[17:32:49] <Caelum> shoky: cool, thanks :)
[17:33:18] <Caelum> awc737: for an arbitrary number after the dash?
[17:33:24] <shoky> hm
[17:33:59] <Caelum> jsfiddle needs a jquery-ui checkbox
[17:34:12] <shoky> Caelum: actually that looks weird to me.. even though it works. i'd first append the div to the DOM somewhere before calling .dialog
[17:34:30] <shoky> but it looks like .dialog does that for you, but i dont trust that ;D
[17:34:42] <awc737> Caelum I already have the iteration to go after
[17:35:16] <Caelum> shoky: so http://jsfiddle.net/JKZan/2/
[17:35:42] <shoky> Caelum: yes or http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/JKZan/3/

[17:36:49] <defaultro> ok folks. I started troubleshooting the issue in Chrome. Here is what I found out. They pull an html template using $.get then the string they receive, they convert it into a javascript function by using different regex patterns. The converted string is stored in the_function. After that line, the code is var fn = new Function("obj", the_function);     This is when it(fn variable) becomes undefined in Chrome but not in Firefox.
[17:36:51] <Caelum> shoky: got it, thanks!
[17:37:01] <defaultro> shoky, hey :)
[17:37:03] <awc737> thanks Caelum, but what if I already have the incrementation
[17:37:05] <awc737> do I need a function?
[17:37:08] <shoky> hey
[17:37:11] <defaultro> i continued my troubleshooting
[17:37:19] <defaultro> look what I found out, see above
[17:37:25] <defaultro> i'll post the code later
[17:38:12] <defaultro> any ideas?
[17:38:59] <shoky> defaultro: same answer as before. see ?demo
[17:39:00] <bot-t> defaultro, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:39:14] <defaultro> k
[17:39:40] <defaultro> in Firefox, fn becomes anonymous(obj)
[17:39:49] <shoky> if you say so
[17:40:16] <shoky> also, who is 'they' ?
[17:40:29] <shoky> i dont really remember what you talked about earlier
[17:42:27] <defaultro> we inherited a code from the other team
[17:42:37] <defaultro> then we inserted our own code to it
[17:43:07] <shoky> k
[17:43:39] <oojacoboo> defaultro: don't you get it
[17:43:47] <oojacoboo> you're not gonna get any help until you create a testcase
[17:43:54] <oojacoboo> quick being so thick
[17:44:15] <defaultro> oojacoboo, I am thinking of how I will make a demo
[17:44:44] <shoky> var fakeAjaxResponse = '<html>lol</html>';
[17:44:46] <shoky> start from that
[17:45:02] <defaultro> k
[17:47:56] <veQue> hey if i have a <div data-role="content" > that i want to use on my first page and second page.. would there be a way of doing this? besides copying markup code?
[17:48:22] <veQue> and changing ids?
[17:49:36] <oojacoboo> so, callback design question
[17:49:40] <shoky> the second page needs a <div data-role="content"> ..
[17:49:44] <shoky> then it better be there
[17:49:54] <shoky> *if the second page..
[17:50:22] <shoky> but i donno jqmobile so maybe im missing your question
[17:50:30] <oojacoboo> meh, nm :P
[17:52:19] <Caelum> I seem to have a conflict somewhere...it's telling me 'undefined is not a function' when I try to call .dialog :(
[17:52:31] <Caelum> how to debug this
[17:55:05] <shoky> you took some variable with undefined value and called it with (...)
[17:55:33] <shoky> so some function/method you're calling is undefined
[17:56:11] <shoky> break it down
[17:56:47] <Caelum> well I'm using the same exact code as in the jsfiddle, and when I end it with .dialog(...) it says undefined is not a function
[17:57:00] <shoky> show me a fiddle with that error
[17:57:05] <Caelum> and when I try to make a dialog from the js console it says the same thing
[17:57:10] <shoky> link..
[17:57:19] <veQue> shoky: yeh i just heard of something called handlebarsjs.. but in my case i think that's overkill.. i'll just copy and paste
[17:57:39] <veQue> its a templateing system
[17:57:41] <Caelum> shoky: can't, internal site, I'm guessing duplicate function somewhere
[17:57:44] <shoky> veQue: yap
[17:58:13] <shoky> Caelum: the fiddle has method chaining
[17:58:33] <shoky> Caelum: break it down.. var div = $('<div');  div.append(...);  div.dialog();
[17:58:41] <shoky> see exactly where the error is coming from
[17:58:52] <Caelum> shoky: I did, it's coming from .dialog()
[17:59:08] <shoky> Caelum: then you're not including jquery UI properly or smth is fucking it up
[17:59:40] <Caelum> shoky: yah something is fucking it up, but how do I find out what
[18:00:15] <shoky> console.log( jQuery.fn.dialog )
[18:00:18] <shoky> undefined ?
[18:01:03] <shoky> and jQuery.ui.version
[18:05:13] <jrockjiggz> is arr[] = 'new val' legal in js? i forget
[18:05:23] <shoky> ?eval arr[] = 'new val'
[18:05:24] <bot-t> shoky: SyntaxError: syntax error
[18:05:50] <Caelum> shoky: both jQuery.fn.dialog and jQuery.ui are undefined
[18:06:22] <shoky> Caelum: mm.. how are you including jquery ui ;S
[18:07:03] <shoky> Caelum: also are you including jquery more than once maybe?
[18:07:10] <jrockjiggz> if I have a <select> how can I get the val()'s content <option>this text</option>
[18:07:23] <shoky> the val()'s content?
[18:07:27] <jrockjiggz> the innerhtml
[18:07:37] <shoky> .html()  or .text()
[18:07:42] <jrockjiggz> $('#select').val().html() ?
[18:07:46] <shoky> why .val() ?
[18:07:54] <jrockjiggz> i want the content inside <option>
[18:08:01] <shoky> er
[18:08:11] <shoky> $('#select > option:selected').text()
[18:08:26] <jrockjiggz> :) ty
[18:08:39] <Caelum> shoky: that's a thought
[18:13:40] <enderx86> Can a form have two submit buttons? If so, how would you differentiate b/w the two submit events in jQuery?
[18:14:08] <oojacoboo> enderx86: you can have two submit buttons IIRC, but they're both just going to submit the action of the form
[18:14:23] <oojacoboo> I'd suggest not having one of them as a type="submit"
[18:14:24] <enderx86> So then I have to use e.target?
[18:14:29] <oojacoboo> then setting up a custom event for it
[18:15:12] <enderx86> Okay, but I want to have the non-submit-type button access form elements, like <option> values
[18:15:16] <enderx86> Can I still do that?
[18:15:23] <oojacoboo> access?
[18:15:37] <oojacoboo> what are you talking about?
[18:16:57] <enderx86> I have a form, with a <select> menu, and two submit buttons. If you hit submit1, you send a JSON. If you hit submit2, you send another JSON. Both submit events use the <option> values from the <select> menu.
[18:17:15] <enderx86> <form><select>...</select></form>
[18:17:19] <oojacoboo> enderx86: js doesn't care
[18:17:25] <coldhead> ?csb2
[18:17:25] <bot-t> http://i.imgur.com/Ic3iR.gif
[18:17:25] <oojacoboo> so, that's a non-issue
[18:17:43] <oojacoboo> coldhead: lol
[18:18:44] <enderx86> Right, I can just select $('form option:selected') from within $('input:button').click(function(e) { // do select here })
[18:19:00] <enderx86> Right?
[18:19:16] <oojacoboo> sure
[18:23:59] <Caelum> shoky: thank you very much, that was exactly it. Lots of jquery inclusions in this horrible mess of templates.
[18:26:43] <spronk> guys, if i have a collection of 3 items with the same class, and i want to fade them in one by one, is there an easy shortcut to this?
[18:26:59] <oojacoboo> spronk: $.each()
[18:27:57] <darcyclarke> oojacoboo that would animate them all at once
[18:28:13] <oojacoboo> darcyclarke: no it wouldn't
[18:28:16] <oojacoboo> not if you set a timeout
[18:28:17] <darcyclarke> no?
[18:28:21] <oojacoboo> no
[18:28:30] <oojacoboo> it's a loop, just set a timeout
[18:28:32] <spronk> so delay within the each closure?
[18:28:38] <oojacoboo> yea
[18:29:26] <spronk> hmm
[18:30:39] <spronk> seems tofade all at once
[18:30:42] <shoky> nah timeout is yucky
[18:31:02] <darcyclarke> oojacoboo saying $.each() is so ambiguous, here's what *could* have come from that: http://jsfiddle.net/e3kLk/
[18:31:18] <darcyclarke> ie. saying $.each() didn't solve his problem
[18:31:31] <darcyclarke> and it still doesn't solve the priblem
[18:31:33] <darcyclarke> problem*
[18:31:58] <darcyclarke> you need a callback for when the first animation is finished spronk
[18:32:04] <darcyclarke> and then the second
[18:32:12] <darcyclarke> if you want to stagger the animations you can do delays/timeouts
[18:32:20] <spronk> was trying to figure out whether there was some way from within the closure i could get the iterator position for something like $(this).delay(pos * 200)
[18:32:21] <darcyclarke> but that can be off
[18:32:35] <darcyclarke> yes you could
[18:33:14] <darcyclarke> spronk http://jsfiddle.net/e3kLk/1/
[18:33:18] <darcyclarke> that's your demo
[18:33:54] <darcyclarke> you can use the index of the element in the collection that's being iterated over times by the duration that your animation is going to be to get the amount of time you should delay the animation
[18:34:08] <darcyclarke> so (i * 500)
[18:34:16] <darcyclarke> 500 is the speed of the animation
[18:34:18] <spronk> oh wow, totally skipped over index in the docs
[18:34:28] * spronk facepalms
[18:34:34] <spronk> thanks darcyclarke, oojacoboo!
[18:34:35] <darcyclarke> spronk it's cool, hope that helps
[18:34:48] <spronk> perfect. much easier than setTimeout :)
[18:34:54] <darcyclarke> yes
[18:35:49] <shoky> spronk: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7QwMk/
[18:36:13] <shoky> could be cleaner im sure
[18:36:58] <darcyclarke> poo spronk you see what shock did? used deferrers which would be even better then just setting a delay
[18:37:08] <darcyclarke> oooo* not poo* lol
[18:37:14] <oojacoboo> nice shoky
[18:37:22] * spronk is wrapping his head around it now
[18:37:26] <vladikoff> shoky, darcyclarke , spronk , http://api.jquery.com/queue/ no good?
[18:37:41] <shoky> vladikoff: no. a queue is per element
[18:37:48] <vladikoff> oh ok
[18:38:48] <spronk> can anyone explain what the promise() method accomplishes there?
[18:38:58] <spronk> i.e. why couldn't just use .done()?
[18:39:01] <darcyclarke> shoky's implementation with the promise is the best…  maybe you could add some comments to help spronk figure out what you did there shocky? ie. explain the promise and the eq methods
[18:39:11] <shoky> spronk: .done() can only be called on promises/deferreds
[18:39:21] <spronk> oic
[18:41:31] <spronk> clever :) - what's the benefit over using delay() ?
[18:41:57] <oojacoboo> spronk: this is just way more accurate and clean
[18:42:09] <oojacoboo> if ensure pinpoint timing of the next animation
[18:42:15] <oojacoboo> it ensures :/
[18:42:17] <shoky> spronk:  if you decided to change the fadeIn time from 500 to 700 for example.. now you have to also change your delay() time
[18:42:19] <shoky> etc.
[18:42:59] <spronk> ah right, so it's a completely queued situ as opposed to a mock queue
[18:43:11] <darcyclarke> spronk yep
[18:43:21] <shoky> aye, and it's easiest to maintain if you wanna change smth
[18:44:07] <shoky> trying to get rid of the 'i' index altogether
[18:44:27] <shoky> gnarf would do this in a sec ;]
[18:46:24] <shoky> nvm too tired
[18:46:36] <spronk> :)
[18:49:44] <spronk> http://www.school-links.co.nz/tour/emergency-alerts/
[18:50:03] <spronk> just needed something to drill home the 1-2-3ness :)
[18:50:30] <oojacoboo> slow it down a notch
[18:50:39] <oojacoboo> and maybe check for the entire DOM to have been loaded
[18:50:56] <shoky> yeah i didnt even notice the fade-in the first time
[18:51:17] <spronk> hmm D:
[18:51:37] <shoky> well i did have devtools up hiding it maybe, heh
[18:52:03] <spronk> might hook the start to display when scrolled to that point
[18:52:32] <oojacoboo> && DOM ready
[18:52:37] <darcyclarke> spronk or window load
[18:52:43] <darcyclarke> then you know the images are loaded
[18:52:47] <darcyclarke> which you seem to rely on
[18:53:21] <spronk> am i mistaken in thinking document.ready() is dom ready?
[18:53:31] <darcyclarke> no
[18:53:43] <darcyclarke> jQuery(function(){ … });
[18:53:55] <spronk> so i just need to hook that on full load instead of dom ready
[18:54:48] <shoky> what
[18:55:00] <shoky> oops
[18:55:11] * shoky dies
[18:56:03] <ryanneufeld> wat?
[18:56:19] <shoky> y u
[18:56:19] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[18:56:26] <Caelum> yay I'm done with this crap!
[18:57:17] <darcyclarke> jQuery(function(){ $(window).on('load', function(){ … }); }); // but this will wait until every asset loads, which may not be as beneficial, you could look into something like desandros images loaded plugin and specify those 4 images you'd like to wait for before starting your fadeIn animations: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[18:57:27] <Caelum> would be nice if they made urls for like: jquery-latest.js
[18:57:37] <shoky> Caelum: they do
[18:57:53] <spronk> darcyclarke: oo, handy. I'll do a bit of testing on simulated slower connections and see what window.load is like
[18:57:54] <darcyclarke> spronk see my last message ^^^
[18:57:56] <Caelum> shoky: orly? nice :)
[18:58:00] <ryanneufeld> Caelum: though it's not recommended for production
[18:58:09] <ryanneufeld> cause it will change with every version
[18:58:19] <darcyclarke> spronk yea, it's pretty straightforward but again it will wait for everything which may not be the desired experience
[18:58:20] <ryanneufeld> and that can sometimes lead to breakage
[18:58:24] <shoky> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
[18:58:41] <shoky> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js
[18:58:54] <spronk> darcyclarke: yeah.. did quite a bit of work to get page size down to as low as possible so hopefully window.load will be ok, but will see :)
[18:59:20] <Caelum> you can just do: $(window).load(function() { ... });
[18:59:30] <Caelum> I use that to run crap after all the ready functions
[18:59:49] <Caelum> because I have a huge mess of ready functions in various templates
[19:00:09] <spronk> Caelum:  specific concern is that might be too slow if there's lots of other content to load
[19:00:43] <Caelum> depends on how much crap you're loading...for most pages it's nearly instantaneous
[19:01:08] <spronk> yeah, am gonna see what it's like on a slower conn before going and looking into imagesloaded plugin
[19:01:09] <shoky> Caelum: even for a page with a single image thats hosted on a server that might be very slow right now..
[19:01:18] <shoky> Caelum: it'll be a while before $(window).load is called
[19:01:58] <Caelum> shoky: I guess if you have huge images, didn't think of that, we just have a bunch of shitty icons
[19:03:33] <Caelum> I made heavy use of the !important tag again today, fuck you CSS
[19:03:37] <spronk> is there a recommended way to detect if an element is within scrollport view these days?
[19:03:39] <shoky> lol.
[19:03:44] <spronk> viewport*
[19:04:23] <shoky> straight math, i think :P
[19:04:56] <spronk> mm, but with respect to binding to the scroll event etc
[19:05:24] <shoky> scroll events dont really have to do with what you asked
[19:05:25] <oojacoboo> is there a way to inspect the data stores added to DOM elements in Chrome?
[19:05:31] <black_warlock> hi
[19:05:33] <darcyclarke> spronk client.height and $(el).offset().top should work
[19:05:47] <darcyclarke> use those two and some good old math
[19:05:47] <spronk> shoky: specifically what i'd like to do is start that animation sequence when the element becomes visible from scrolling
[19:05:56] <shoky> oojacoboo: you mean with .data(..) ?
[19:05:59] <oojacoboo> yea
[19:06:00] <black_warlock> anyone here knows how to get the actual div height ?
[19:06:11] <shoky> oojacoboo: $(...).data()
[19:06:13] <arschmitz> veQue: gnarf: this should work if i understand what you are trying to do correctly select an input and it will add the text to that input. http://jsfiddle.net/y39QP/19/
[19:06:13] <oojacoboo> data-whatever attr
[19:06:18] <oojacoboo> shoky: no, in the DOM
[19:06:18] <darcyclarke> by shaky I meant sprok o_O oh god too many "s" names
[19:06:19] <oojacoboo> inspect
[19:06:24] <darcyclarke> o_O
[19:06:42] <shoky> oojacoboo: without the console..?
[19:06:52] <oojacoboo> without logging to the console, yes
[19:07:01] <shoky> uhh
[19:07:45] <shoky> dont think so?
[19:07:49] <shoky> well
[19:07:58] <shoky> lets see.
[19:08:14] <danzik17> oojacoboo: what are you trying to do?  just get at all data- attributes?
[19:08:37] <oojacoboo> danzik17: yea, I wanna be able to see their values and that their added without having to log every single one
[19:08:43] <oojacoboo> just some basic inspection
[19:09:34] <shoky> i think there are plugins for that
[19:10:14] <danzik17> you could use element.dataset
[19:10:25] <danzik17> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.dataset
[19:10:27] <veQue> arschmitz: hey thanks.. i kinda got the answer from someone a while ago..
[19:10:30] <veQue> but thanks =)
[19:10:43] <oojacoboo> danzik17: I'm really looking for an easy way to inspect, non-programatically
[19:10:55] <danzik17> ummm...right click and inspect?
[19:11:00] <spronk> so it seems the answer to my question above is to use an interval timer instead of attaching detection function to scroll event
[19:11:09] <oojacoboo> danzik17: that doesn't show the data- attr
[19:11:25] <veQue> arschmitz: you wouldnt happen to know how to keep the buttons from focusing/glowing when clicked? i just want the text input that is current to be glowing
[19:11:53] <danzik17> yes it does - it's an attribute like any other.  what aren't you seeing?
[19:12:03] <oojacoboo> danzik17: not if it's added with js
[19:12:14] <oojacoboo> danzik17: I'm not seeing any of the data attr, that's what ;)
[19:12:19] <oojacoboo> yet I can log them
[19:12:23] <danzik17> using $().data?
[19:12:34] <oojacoboo> log them, yes
[19:12:34] <shoky> oojacoboo: heh.. you can in chrome elements tab, go to some element's properties and get to the window object->jQuery->cache
[19:12:42] <shoky> and see the data cache :)
[19:12:47] <shoky> with no console
[19:12:47] <oojacoboo> oh nice, thanks shoky
[19:12:52] <shoky> that is not fun at all though
[19:12:56] <shoky> use the console
[19:12:58] <oojacoboo> yea, I was searching there myself
[19:14:59] <shoky> oojacoboo: do you know about $0 ?
[19:15:18] <oojacoboo> I've seen that before, but na, remind me
[19:15:33] <shoky> inspect some element, then write $0 in the console
[19:15:41] <shoky> $0 is a reference to the current inspected element
[19:15:48] <shoky> $($0).data()  is the element's data
[19:15:56] <oojacoboo> ah ha!
[19:15:59] <oojacoboo> that's perfect
[19:16:01] <raj> wtf
[19:16:02] <shoky> ;]
[19:16:03] <raj> that's awesome
[19:16:10] <oojacoboo> shoky++
[19:17:01] <oojacoboo> shoky: still doesn't have the jquery data stores
[19:17:07] <oojacoboo> at least not in my example
[19:17:08] <shoky> $._data($0)
[19:17:12] <shoky> i think^
[19:17:12] <oojacoboo> ah
[19:17:35] <oojacoboo> bingo
[19:17:43] <arschmitz> veQue: that is done with the .ui-focus class which is automaticly added and removed by jquery mobile to work around this copy this class and give it another name and handle it your self
[19:17:50] <oojacoboo> I see, just call that function and pass that element
[19:18:30] <veQue> arschmitz: awesome thanks
[19:19:10] <arschmitz> veQue: no problem ill be around for a little while if you need anything else
[19:19:58] <veQue> cool
[19:20:24] <shoky> sup raj
[19:20:53] <black_warlock> how can update the value of a var =
[19:21:04] <black_warlock> if i have starting value =  0
[19:21:07] <black_warlock> exemple
[19:21:13] <black_warlock> var pip=0
[19:21:25] <black_warlock> after an if how do i redefine it ?
[19:21:44] <black_warlock> simply pip=newvalue or var pip=newvalue?
[19:22:20] <shoky> pip=newvalue
[19:22:38] <shoky> you don't redefine it, you just change its value
[19:25:00] <shoky> damn i wish chrome console supported this: https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Include
[19:26:04] <oojacoboo> I just found tin.cr the other day, loving it
[19:27:18] <shoky> i don't like these solutions saving automatically to the actual local file
[19:27:25] <oojacoboo> same
[19:27:28] <oojacoboo> I dislike that part
[19:27:30] <shoky> i want to have that option if needed
[19:27:39] <oojacoboo> but I love the autoreload
[19:27:47] <shoky> chrome devtools already has most of that
[19:27:50] <oojacoboo> shoky: you can disable that though
[19:27:57] <oojacoboo> shoky: auto reload?
[19:28:19] <shoky> maybe im not sure what that means
[19:28:33] <oojacoboo> shoky: you can edit the file on your fs and it will show up in the browser instantly
[19:28:39] <shoky> ahh
[19:28:43] <oojacoboo> edit css save, boom
[19:28:50] <oojacoboo> js the same
[19:29:19] <shoky> maybe ill give it a shot
[19:29:32] <oojacoboo> saves me time from having to refresh
[19:29:47] <oojacoboo> and instead of editing css in the inspector, I can edit in my final file
[19:33:01] <shoky> ya especially useful for those parts of the UI that you need some clicks or whatnot to get to, after a refresh
[19:33:17] <oojacoboo> shoky: exactly
[19:33:27] <oojacoboo> like all our forms that are in modals
[19:33:32] <oojacoboo> sooo tiresome
[19:33:45] <shoky> yar. i shall install
[19:34:09] <shoky> thx
[19:34:19] <oojacoboo> fo sho
[19:35:41] <shoky> hmm tho donno if ill be able to make it work with the office's retarded java environment
[19:35:54] <oojacoboo> :(
[19:37:06] <black_warlock> why if i split .css string
[19:37:12] <black_warlock> ($(".single_box").css("padding")).split('px')
[19:37:22] <black_warlock> i get 10,
[19:37:29] <black_warlock> or n,
[19:37:38] <black_warlock> i got comma after it ?
[19:38:19] <shoky> what's the full array?
[19:38:28] <shoky> and/or string
[19:38:45] <black_warlock> that one
[19:38:50] <black_warlock> ($(".single_box").css("padding"))
[19:38:59] <shoky> what does it return........
[19:38:59] <black_warlock> var paddingval=($(".single_box").css("padding")).split('px')
[19:39:03] <black_warlock> 10,
[19:39:10] <black_warlock> there is the comma
[19:39:15] <black_warlock> 10,<<<<<<
[19:39:15] <shoky> what does $(".single_box").css("padding")  return
[19:39:20] <black_warlock> 10px
[19:39:20] <shoky> not the split
[19:39:34] <shoky> huh.
[19:39:40] <black_warlock> wait let me post it
[19:39:42] <shoky> ?eval '10px'.split('px')
[19:39:44] <bot-t> shoky: ["10", ""]
[19:39:54] <shoky> the string is "10"
[19:39:55] <shoky> no comma
[19:40:00] <shoky> the comma is in the array
[19:40:36] <shoky> (split returns an array)
[19:41:11] <spronk> http://jsfiddle.net/7QwMk/3/ anyone give me an idea on why this wouldn't be working? Also, whether there's a better way of doing it?
[19:41:28] <spronk> is meant to start animation once scroll has reached bottom
[19:41:56] <black_warlock> it alerts so
[19:41:57] <black_warlock> 10,
[19:42:13] <spronk> oh? i'm not getting any alerts..
[19:43:10] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/EE2Ab/3/
[19:43:12] <black_warlock> see
[19:43:32] <black_warlock> i need it because i have to add the split value to the newheight
[19:43:52] <black_warlock> i have made a function that make all divs with the same class
[19:44:10] <black_warlock> have the same height adapted to the higher div
[19:44:24] <black_warlock> but
[19:44:36] <black_warlock> i dont know why looks like doesnt consider the padding
[19:45:04] <black_warlock> the result is good
[19:45:16] <black_warlock> and dont need to give fixed height
[19:45:27] <shoky> black_warlock:  you're alerting the array
[19:45:31] <black_warlock> ye
[19:45:36] <shoky> there are 2 eleemnts in it
[19:45:39] <shoky> "10" and ""
[19:45:49] <shoky> it's just printing out the array..
[19:45:54] <shoky> "10,"
[19:46:06] <black_warlock> but i didnt put the ," "
[19:46:14] <black_warlock> to get the height
[19:46:14] <shoky> ITS PRINTING OUT THE ARRAY
[19:46:19] <black_warlock> hum
[19:46:19] <shoky> the comma is part of the array
[19:46:28] <black_warlock> how to get only the value ?
[19:46:46] <shoky> how do you get a value from an array?
[19:47:00] <shoky> var a=['hi','bye'];  how do you get 'bye'  ?
[19:47:05] <shoky> or 'hi' ?
[19:47:08] <tw2113> myvar['key']
[19:47:15] <shoky> that's not an array ;]
[19:47:18] <coldhead> unshift or pop
[19:47:24] <shoky> gorramz u
[19:47:25] <tw2113> i may be mixing in php
[19:47:34] <black_warlock> ye
[19:47:36] <shoky> so rude
[19:47:51] <shoky> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/EE2Ab/6/
[19:47:54] <black_warlock> padding[0] ?
[19:48:00] <tw2113> shoky, is coldhead being rude to you?
[19:48:26] <black_warlock> ah thats right
[19:48:28] <black_warlock> so
[19:48:33] <shoky> i dont know when he's more rude, when he talks or during his long bouts of silence
[19:48:38] <black_warlock> how to add that value to newheight
[19:48:47] <black_warlock> newheight+padding[0]
[19:48:48] <black_warlock>  ?
[19:48:55] <shoky> black_warlock:  padding[0] is a string
[19:49:00] <shoky> turn it into an int
[19:49:09] <black_warlock> hum i don remember
[19:49:28] <shoky> then go find out
[19:50:05] <shoky> meh. parseInt
[19:50:13] <shoky> Number
[19:50:14] <shoky> whatever
[19:50:20] <black_warlock> parseInt
[19:50:20] <shoky> its not your first day
[19:50:32] <shoky> you should know this by now, start focusing man
[19:51:16] <tw2113> my first day is tuesday
[19:51:30] <shoky> excited?
[19:51:42] <tw2113> like coldhead around a female
[19:51:46] <oojacoboo> man, building this ajaxy document storage system has been tricky
[19:52:20] <black_warlock> amazing
[19:52:29] <black_warlock> i found the way to adapt heights
[19:52:40] <shoky> you truly are
[19:52:44] <Frozenn> /server -m irc.voltamirc.com.br
[19:52:47] <black_warlock> without fixing the container height
[19:52:49] <Frozenn> \server -m irc.voltamirc.com.br
[19:52:56] <shoky> f-f-fail
[19:53:01] <tw2113> next: take over the world, black_warlock
[19:53:02] <oojacoboo> lol
[19:53:10] <black_warlock> =(
[19:55:13] <tw2113> too much work?
[19:55:20] <oojacoboo> black_warlock: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3Pjmp4ql-w
[19:55:22] <oojacoboo> you feel like that?
[19:56:09] <black_warlock> T_T
[19:56:17] <black_warlock> bum bum bum bum bum
[19:56:33] <coldhead> hello my old country hello
[19:57:15] <coldhead> ah Frozenn, we hardly knew ye
[19:58:43] <shoky> oojacoboo: seems tincr wont let me work not with file:// urls nor with http://localhost:8000/ ...
[19:58:48] <shoky> whats up with that
[19:59:07] <oojacoboo> shoky: why would it care?
[19:59:18] <oojacoboo> you just select your localhost file location
[19:59:29] <shoky> oojacoboo: the 'select project' selectbox is disabled
[19:59:32] <oojacoboo> I could see file:// being an issue
[19:59:52] <acidjazz> so im doing something like document.ontouchmove = function(e) { alert($(e.currentTarget).attr('class')); }
[19:59:53] <acidjazz> which i keep getting udnefined.. how do i get the classname of hte nested element?
[19:59:55] <shoky> 'project type' i mean
[20:00:01] <oojacoboo> ah
[20:00:16] <oojacoboo> shoky: quick fix
[20:00:43] <shoky> well im just trying with a simple http server now
[20:01:06] <oojacoboo> sudo echo "127.0.0.1 mysite.dev" > /etc/hosts
[20:01:09] <shoky> i guess its cause of that? but i thought it would still let me choose a local folder
[20:01:30] <shoky> heh im on windows, but ye i got aliases
[20:01:35] <coldhead> you damn well want >>, not >
[20:01:41] <shoky> lol^
[20:01:43] <coldhead> otherwise you'll nuke your hosts file
[20:01:47] <oojacoboo> coldhead: lol
[20:01:48] <oojacoboo> yes!
[20:02:31] <coldhead> maybe #jQuery isn't the best place for unix advice :D
[20:02:37] <coldhead> still caveat emptor
[20:03:41] <shoky> oojacoboo: ah now its not disabled (still with localhost), i guess it was some fluke
[20:03:42] <abjorn> good thing there's probably nothing in there unless you already put something in there :p in which case you probably would've already known to use the hosts file
[20:03:56] <oojacoboo> shoky: yea, that seemed weird
[20:07:12] <coldhead> os x and most linuxes have a bunch in the hosts file without user intervention
[20:07:18] <coldhead> esp. ipv6 stuff
[20:09:16] <acidjazz> ok so what is wrong w/ document.ontouchmove = function(e) { alert(e.currrentTarget.id); };
[20:10:21] <coldhead> i don't like the lack of jquery
[20:10:24] <coldhead> or the font
[20:10:45] <shoky> oojacoboo: doesnt seem to work ;SS  just updating a css file in my editor, and saving.
[20:11:20] <acidjazz> coldhead: the jquery version doesnt work
[20:11:39] <acidjazz> coldhead: $(document).bind('touchmove', function(e) { alert($(this).attr('class')); });
[20:11:58] <acidjazz> not even an alert
[20:12:28] <coldhead> hmm, it looks like it should work
[20:12:57] <awc737> is this proper json? {"title-1":["The title-1 field is required."],"file-1":["The file-1 field is required."]}
[20:13:02] <w00tner> hello
[20:13:18] <awc737> it seems as though each key's value is itself an array...
[20:13:19] <coldhead> oh maybe that you have too many "r"s in current?
[20:14:52] <coldhead> acidjazz: http://jsfiddle.net/5rCud/ works for me in opera mobile emulator
[20:15:19] <coldhead> ?jsonlint
[20:15:20] <bot-t> JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[20:15:22] <w00tner> I have this dragable divs that you can drop to a div that contains an static images... so you can drop 3 divs (image, text, color) so i wan tto recreate this into a <canvas> so i can from there create an image to save.. i created this function to retrieve the data:  http://pastie.org/5487089    Q: How do i drop that info to a canvas correctly ??
[20:15:27] <shoky> oojacoboo: if i change background-color of some class, i'm supposed to see it change?
[20:16:05] <coldhead> jsonlint says that's valid, awc737
[20:16:57] <shoky> oojacoboo: it also isn't saving the other way around :\
[20:17:23] <oojacoboo> open inspector
[20:17:26] <oojacoboo> check for logs
[20:17:26] <acidjazz> coldhead: thats id.. i need classname
[20:19:08] <shoky> oojacoboo: not seeing any logs
[20:19:49] <coldhead> idk man it's your code
[20:20:02] <coldhead> it's pretty much my first day using ontouch
[20:20:09] <coldhead> and i am not caring for it so far
[20:21:01] <acidjazz> well the issue is i have this handler on document
[20:21:16] <acidjazz> but i want to check if the internal element im touching has a certain class before i e.preventDefault();
[20:22:05] <coldhead> can;t you just bind to the particular class and preventDefault there?
[20:22:30] <coldhead> $('.naughty').bind('touchmove', fn preventDefault) ?
[20:28:05] <shoky> oojacoboo: derp.. and suddenly it started working :\
[20:28:24] <shoky> i swear i changed nothing :P
[20:28:34] <shoky> just reloaded it a few times
[20:28:42] <awc737> if I have a script not wrapped in document ready, is it a guarantee jQuery will be loaded if jQuery is included before the script?
[20:29:24] <awc737> so the order on my index.html goes include jquery, then use jquery function (without document.ready)
[20:29:52] <coldhead> it should work, unless jQuery fails to load for some reason
[20:29:58] <coldhead> .ready() doesn't mean to wait for jQuery
[20:30:04] <coldhead> it means to wait for the DOM to finish loading
[20:30:17] <coldhead> $ won't work if jquery isn't loaded first
[20:30:24] <coldhead> the browser won't know what $ means
[20:30:43] <awc737> oh ok so its the same as document ready, if its after jquery is included
[20:31:22] <coldhead> eh, close enough
[20:31:55] <coldhead> you have to load jQuery before you can use jQuery, and you have to use ready() if the browser needs to wait for DOM elements to load before doing jQuery things with them
[20:32:08] <awc737> k perfect
[20:32:21] <awc737> my actual function in an external script is within a document.ready
[20:32:43] <coldhead> great
[20:32:48] <awc737> however, I'm setting javascript variables from PHP in my index.html
[20:32:57] <coldhead> ah yes
[20:33:01] <coldhead> classic use case
[20:33:07] <awc737> and for that I'm just doing it at the very bottom before </body>, but after the jquery include
[20:33:28] <coldhead> sounds like a recipe for success
[20:33:40] <awc737> =D thanks
[20:34:10] <shoky> take 5, coldhead
[20:34:19] <awc737> you earned it
[20:34:31] <tw2113> take 4:59 coldhead, then get back to work!
[20:34:35] <shoky> !
[20:34:38] <coldhead> thanks fellas, can do
[20:34:48] <tw2113> 5 minutes and you're costing us money
[20:34:53] <tw2113> 4:59, free
[20:36:15] <awc737> ill take two
[20:37:32] <chewed-on> Does anyone see any problem with this code especially on line 6:  http://pastebin.com/0qwtRQcc  ?
[20:38:16] <chewed-on> On IE8 we're getting a "this.form" is null or not an object
[20:38:24] <chewed-on> but on IE 7 and IE 9, Safari, Chrome, Firefox
[20:38:28] <chewed-on> we do not get any errors.
[20:39:07] <coldhead> $(this).closest('form')[0].submit()
[20:39:39] <chewed-on> coldhead: I'll give that a shot and see how it goes.
[20:41:15] <chewed-on> coldhead: would that have any problem on IE7 and IE 9 ?
[20:41:25] <chewed-on> (I'm hoping it doesn't introduce new bugs into different version of IE)
[20:42:19] <MeMReS> is it bad practice to use the onClick property?
[20:42:33] <chewed-on> coldhead: *worships coldhead like a god* hooo haaa haaa hoooo haaaa haaa *dance around the bon fire*
[20:43:12] * tw2113 dances in the bonfire
[20:44:26] <woopwoop> I'm trying to post base64 data over to server side for processing, but it seems to break when the uri is too long or contains more than 18kb of data
[20:44:32] <woopwoop> is that a known issue?
[20:44:59] <beachandbytes> what are you using server side
[20:45:24] <woopwoop> node
[20:45:36] <woopwoop> but it doesn't even reach the server
[20:45:45] <woopwoop> it gives me an error on the post itself in chrome
[20:45:59] <woopwoop> just the error icon, no actual error msg
[20:46:11] <woopwoop> same function works with smaller uri
[20:47:11] <coldhead> chewed-on: the benefit of that strategy is you do as much as possible in jQUery and let it handle any cross browser bugs without you having to know or care about them
[20:47:17] <coldhead> which is what i assume was happening
[20:48:41] <chewed-on> coldhead: It has fixed the problem but others have said that's a work around
[20:48:51] <chewed-on> I don't understand why it's a work around though
[20:49:10] <coldhead> it's a workaround because you're not doing it in the "pure JS which should just work way"
[20:49:25] <coldhead> but it works around the problem of that not working
[20:49:29] <coldhead> in some browsers
[20:49:52] <coldhead> life is too short to learn the ways in which different browsers don't work
[20:50:19] <woopwoop> here's the snippet if anyone's wondering http://pastebin.com/Rh31UH2c
[20:50:46] <coldhead> people who have a problem with doing it via an easy workaround that works can spend their evenings pushing crayons into their bodily orifices
[20:50:50] <coldhead> and you may tell them i said so
[20:51:57] <coldhead> i think we've earned another short break
[20:52:01] <coldhead> good job everyone
[20:54:50] <warden23> Hello I currently have href="javascript:history.go(-1)" what can I add to that to make the page refresh once hitting back?
[20:55:01] <tw2113> coldhead, http://i.imgur.com/zRu5w.jpg
[20:55:10] <wroathe> yeoman makes me smile
[20:55:11] <warden23> Take in mind I can only have something entered between the href="code here" tag
[20:55:19] <wroathe> Pretty snazzy tool imo
[20:55:38] <oojacoboo> shoky: you get it?
[20:56:38] <fedya_> does anyone know how to make the validator remote method wait until the remote validation succeeds? because it just marks the form valid before teh remote validation returns
[20:57:45] <awc737> what validator
[20:58:38] <acidjazz> i need a good example of an event handler on document doing something that an event handler on a class name is overriding
[21:06:23] <mynameisthom> Hello, I'm facing a little problem on 'change' event. So, my case, is I'd like to show 'live preview' below textbox. M using $(selector).change( function(){ }); to do this, but it gimme the result after the pointer is not inside the textbox/ cursor clicked outside the textbox. I've tried using live(), bind('change') but the effect is just the same. What is the right selector to solve my prob? Thank you.
[21:06:53] <Justin_T> i would like to know how i can grow a select list with multiple option enable, lets say a "list box" while adding items dynamically?
[21:08:30] <Justin_T> grow it in size
[21:10:00] <acidjazz> does anyone know of an acutal working example of binding an event to document to e.preventDefault() and overriding that in an event on an internal div?
[21:10:11] <mynameisthom> Justin_T: you may add CSS prop to the 'list', min-height. So it will dynamically grow
[21:10:36] <srj555> I have a textarea with html/css/js in the contents.  How can I prevent the browser from trying to interpret this JS ?  Can I somehow escape it without affecting the actual contents?
[21:10:46] <Justin_T> thanks
[21:11:09] <coder7of9> i would like to programatically trigger a slider
[21:11:13] <coder7of9> possible?
[21:11:42] <coldhead> sure baby
[21:11:48] <coldhead> whatever floats your boats
[21:12:22] <coder7of9> it isnb't cold
[21:12:28] * tw2113 is watching WordPress tickets go out the door
[21:12:41] <coder7of9> hotheads? not
[21:12:44] <acidjazz> PLEASE
[21:12:53] <coder7of9> ok
[21:12:57] <acidjazz> coldhead: i know you know this stuff
[21:12:58] <coldhead> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#method-value
[21:13:11] <coder7of9> thz
[21:13:33] <acidjazz> basic situation where i have an event on document doing an e.preventDefault() stopping it on the whole site.. except for certain elements
[21:13:43] <tw2113> acidjazz, so you want to prevent 1 event and inside the callback cause another
[21:13:43] <tw2113> ?
[21:13:45] <mynameisthom> case closed :D I should use keypress instead of change :D thx
[21:13:48] <acidjazz> tw2113: bingo
[21:13:58] <acidjazz> tw2113: i have touchmove on document do a preventDefault()
[21:14:07] <acidjazz> tw2113: i want to add "scrollable" classes to divs that can scroll
[21:15:19] <tw2113> $(document).on('touchmove', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('.someDOM').addClass('scrollable'); });
[21:15:32] <coder7of9> coldhead thanks very much!
[21:16:30] <acidjazz> tw2113: so the document line is eactly what i have...
[21:16:45] <tw2113> it's my guess, i haven't tested
[21:16:49] <acidjazz> tw2113: you want me to assign a class inside of there? what would that do?
[21:17:14] <tw2113> assign "scrollable" to everything you select in the first part
[21:20:09] <coldhead> how's everybody doing
[21:21:20] <awc737> how can I strip the "-2" from "string-2", to just leave string
[21:22:49] <coldhead> ?eval 'string-2'.match(/(^.*)-\d+/)[1]
[21:22:52] <bot-t> coldhead: "string"
[21:22:52] <awc737> $(this).replace(???, '')
[21:23:06] <awc737> i will never understand regex...
[21:23:13] <coldhead> you should learn them!
[21:23:19] <coldhead> they'll save you hundreds of hours
[21:23:21] <awc737> do you know them off the top of your head?
[21:23:24] <coldhead> yes!
[21:23:28] <coldhead> practice makes perfect
[21:23:47] <awc737> yeah seriously... it's like trying to encrypt hyroglyphs... written by monkeys, from another dimensions
[21:23:59] <coldhead> they're so worth learning, you can use them in so many languages
[21:24:23] <awc737> yeah your right I should
[21:24:36] <awc737> w3schools just had a crappy guide
[21:24:39] <awc737> so I got turned off
[21:24:41] <coldhead> best way to practice is use a text editor which lets you use them for search/replace
[21:24:45] <awc737> MDN looks better
[21:24:47] <coldhead> ugh fuck w3schools
[21:24:48] <awc737> that would be good
[21:24:54] <coldhead> you don't even need to learn JS regexes
[21:25:03] <coldhead> they're much the same anywhere
[21:25:17] <coldhead> mastering regular expressions from o'reilly is worth reading
[21:25:31] <coldhead> then you'll know more than most people and you can get on with more interesting problems
[21:26:28] <awc737> yes indeed =D what a great field
[21:26:53] <awc737> looks like damn ascii art /(\w+)\s(\w+)/;
[21:28:28] <coldhead> its all pretty obvious once you know what they mean
[21:28:34] <coldhead> w matches a word character
[21:28:37] <coldhead> s matches a space
[21:28:44] <coldhead> and capitals are opposite
[21:28:49] <coldhead> so \W is not a word char
[21:28:52] <coldhead> and \S is not a space
[21:29:46] <awc737> how do I use this http://regexpal.com/
[21:31:03] <coldhead> like this http://i.imgur.com/d1Dsd.png
[21:34:43] <awc737> I am getting Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'replace'
[21:34:55] <awc737> message = $(val).replace(/\d+/, 3);
[21:35:18] <coldhead> $(val).val().replace...
[21:35:24] <awc737> thanks
[21:37:00] <awc737> lol Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'toLowerCase' of undefined
[21:37:08] <awc737> val = $(val).val().replace(/\d+/, 3);
[21:37:37] <coldhead> is val a selector or a dom element or what?
[21:38:05] <awc737> $.each(formErrors, function(key, val) {
[21:38:06] <awc737> its a key / value in json array
[21:38:22] <coldhead> then you probably dont' want $()
[21:38:31] <coldhead> because if the val is "aids"
[21:38:36] <coldhead> that will be $("aids")
[21:38:41] <coldhead> trying to match <aids>
[21:38:42] <awc737> i thought I had to, as replace was a jquery function?
[21:38:52] <coldhead> nope, vanilla JS
[21:39:08] <coldhead> ?eval 'aids'.replace(/aids/, 'lol')
[21:39:09] <bot-t> coldhead: "lol"
[21:39:13] <JoeHazzers> say i have something which handles clicks, and then i append some html, how can i have the newly inserted HTML subject to the click handler?
[21:39:21] <coldhead> any luck acidjazz ?
[21:39:30] <oojacoboo> JoeHazzers: of course
[21:39:37] <awc737> who has aids?
[21:39:37] <JoeHazzers> do i need to use .on()?
[21:39:46] <oojacoboo> no
[21:39:50] <coldhead> get yourself a chocolate frog, JoeHazzers :)
[21:40:21] <JoeHazzers> oojacoboo: how can i go about it?
[21:40:59] <oojacoboo> $("#selector").click(function(event){ $(this).html("my new string"); });
[21:40:59] <awc737> val.replace( gives me error:
[21:41:00] <awc737> Object The title-1 field is required. has no method 'replace'
[21:41:52] <coldhead> the val is an object?
[21:42:07] <coldhead> replace is a method of String
[21:42:09] <awc737> surprisingly...
[21:42:11] <JoeHazzers> oojacoboo: i feel as though i was not clear... create page, append elements, new elements are not subject to existing click().
[21:42:11] <coldhead> if val is not a string...
[21:42:31] <oojacoboo> JoeHazzers: use .on()
[21:42:37] <JoeHazzers> oojacoboo: cheers
[21:42:38] <awc737> oh thats right, for no good reason, jquery parseJSON was making my 'key' => '[value]'
[21:43:12] <coldhead> val[0].replace()
[21:43:31] <awc737> lol
[21:43:46] <awc737> is it worth going back to mess with my PHP json_encode / jquery parse?
[21:44:00] <awc737> what you said should work and i'm happy with it...
[21:44:00] <coldhead> matter for yourself
[21:44:09] <coldhead> i'd make the php correct
[21:44:16] <veQue> if i out a var inside document ready function is the var global?
[21:44:16] <coldhead> just to avoid having to fix it AND the JS later
[21:44:24] <veQue> out= put
[21:44:26] <coldhead> veQue: si
[21:44:30] <veQue> thnx
[21:45:32] * black_warlock g night people !

[21:49:16] <acidjazz> coldhead: stopDefault() on body and then stopPropagation() in the inner event seems to killl stopDefault() indefinitely
[21:49:42] <acidjazz> coldhead: how about this.. if i wrap an event around document can i inside taht handler detect the inner div being clicked/selected??
[21:50:08] <coldhead> isn't that what event.target is for?
[21:50:27] <coldhead> i have done 0 work with touchevents and 0 work with non-jQ events
[21:50:53] <jessica> can any1 help me
[21:50:54] <tw2113> it's his first day
[21:50:55] <tw2113> come on
[21:51:16] <acidjazz> coldhead: hmm let me play w/ event.target
[21:51:34] <coldhead> can you be more specific, jessica? i opened your fiddle and saw a lot of code and then i felt very tired
[21:51:36] <acidjazz> coldhead: how can i pull a classname out of event.target?
[21:51:40] <awc737> I have a function which $.clone's a big block of html . Everytime I clone (button is on bottom), the page shoots me to the top again. why?
[21:51:57] <coldhead> event.target.className ?
[21:52:04] <tw2113> awc737, is it triggered on a link?
[21:52:07] <coldhead> $(event.target).attr('class')
[21:52:14] <awc737> is that event target to me?
[21:52:25] <coldhead> or $(event.target).is('.someclass') is nice if that's an option
[21:52:26] <awc737> its triggered on click
[21:52:27] <coldhead> i use that a lot
[21:52:32] <tw2113> what type of dom element?
[21:52:33] <tw2113> link?
[21:52:39] <awc737> yeah a href #
[21:52:46] <tw2113> that'd be why you move to the top
[21:52:59] <awc737> sweet, good catch because I don't want # in my url
[21:53:00] <tw2113> you're executing the link, and an href of # take you to the top of the page
[21:53:17] <acidjazz> lol coldhead im gonna marr y you
[21:53:29] <tw2113> no i am acidjazz !
[21:53:32] <awc737> me 2
[21:53:34] <tw2113> you can't have him
[21:54:22] <coldhead> now now, let's not go overboard
[21:54:27] <coldhead> i have many flaws
[21:54:47] <coldhead> i can't think of any just now but i'm sure they exist
[21:56:05] <tw2113> stuck in eternal groundhog day coldhead ?
[21:56:28] <coldhead> this is my first day being stuck in groundhog day
[21:58:35] <ejo> always is
[22:02:24] <coldhead> GOD I AM SO BORED
[22:09:54] <tintin> Anybody there? CAn i ask now?
[22:10:17] <tintin> How can i get the value of <input type="file" /> , the full path from file
[22:11:21] <coldhead> you can't, tintin http://jsfiddle.net/jzhQ4/
[22:11:30] <coldhead> it's hidden from you for security
[22:11:41] <coldhead> you CAN obtain the path using the File API
[22:11:46] <coldhead> but that doesn't work in all browsers
[22:12:34] <tintin> What is File API ?
[22:12:44] <tintin> Is File api writen in jqeury?
[22:13:01] <coldhead> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
[22:13:06] <coldhead> no, it's part of HTML5
[22:14:33] <tintin> coldhead: How is ajax file upload done then?
[22:15:41] <coldhead> very badly
[22:16:01] <tintin> Is it possible to submit a form with ajax?
[22:16:11] <tintin> How can i submit form with ajax?
[22:16:21] <coldhead> have you done ANY research into this, tintin ?
[22:16:27] <coldhead> ?ajax
[22:16:28] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:16:33] <coldhead> that will let you send most form data
[22:16:35] <coldhead> not files
[22:16:40] <coldhead> for ajax file uploads i use https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[22:16:45] <coldhead> i have no idea how it works internally
[22:16:47] <tintin> I know about .ajax() function very well
[22:16:48] <coldhead> which is why i use it
[22:18:37] <tintin> coldhead: Does jquery file upload do .ajax() ? how does it get the full path of file then?
[22:19:03] <defaultro> shoky, I fixed it. :)
[22:19:37] <tintin> shoky: Hi shocky, how are you?
[22:20:31] <coldhead> tintin: i don't know how it works, as i said
[22:20:45] <coldhead> you can have a look at the source code on github if you are interested
[22:20:52] <coldhead> i am happy to have it work without understanding why
[22:21:02] <coldhead> in that respect it is much like a woman's love
[22:21:56] <tintin> coldhead: If you can't get the full path with jquery, then how can you do .ajax() upload with jquery?
[22:22:42] <coldhead> i don't do ajax() upload with jQuery
[22:22:48] <coldhead> i use blueimp's jquery file upload
[22:22:55] <coldhead> and it does file upload via ajax for me
[22:23:10] <coldhead> if you want to do it yourself have a look at how blueimp does it
[22:23:12] <tintin> Is it possible to do .ajax() upload with jquery?
[22:23:22] <coldhead> yes tintin
[22:23:34] <coldhead> as i said above, ajax file upload with jquery is the easiest thing in the world
[22:23:43] <coldhead> there is no reason for plugins like blueimp's library
[22:23:54] <coldhead> because it all just works magically just by your hoping enough
[22:24:02] <coldhead> the more you hope the better it works
[22:24:22] <coldhead> anyway i have to go nail my scrotum to a coffee table now, good luck!
[22:24:25] <tintin> coldhead: blueimp should be the jquery ajax upload
[22:24:34] <tintin> How can i submit a form with jquery?
[22:26:02] <w00tner> hello guys
[22:26:19] <w00tner> can anyone check this function? i get [undefined] http://pastie.org/5487416

[22:36:24] <w00tner> is this correct ?   "<foreignObject width='100%' height='100%'>" + "<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' style='font-size:40px'>" + "<div>" htmlPre + <div>" + "<div>" + htmlRes + "</div>" + "<div>" + htmlTxt + "</div>" + "</foreignObject>" +

[22:42:58] <xertion> Hi guys, I want to include jQuery from a .js file, and the .js file is loaded in the <body> with <script src=""> tag. My problem is that I do successfully append the jQuery to the HTML head,
[22:43:13] <xertion> but this is done AFTER the page has loaded, which means jQuery is still not "active" to run my jQuery code.
[22:44:22] <tehopeologist> can i put more values in .css than just 1 set?
[22:44:24] <tehopeologist> http://pastebin.com/HMAc0XkE
[22:44:46] <tehopeologist> can i put, like, background-color and color?  or do i need to run another .css line?
[22:48:00] <coldhead> .css({color: '#ccc', 'background-color': '#0f0', etc: 'etc'})
[22:48:05] <tehopeologist> danke
[22:48:08] <coldhead> enjoy
[22:48:43] <coldhead> xertion: how are you adding jQuery?
[22:49:11] <xertion> coldhead: http://pastebin.com/PDgpH0tk
[22:49:46] <coldhead> xertion: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQrPL/
[22:50:09] <coldhead> that lets you run a successhandler once it's loaded
[22:50:17] <coldhead> so you can trigger the jQuery specific stuff in there
[22:50:39] <xertion> coldhead: cool checking it out.
[22:51:45] <xertion> coldhead: thanks a lot man.
[22:51:52] <coldhead> happy hacking xertion
[22:56:31] <wiremaster> hi all
[22:56:47] <wiremaster> in jQuery UI, is it possible for each handle to have a different 'step'
[22:56:48] <coldhead> hi baby

[23:15:53] <aqeel> hi room

[23:17:12] <bot-t> http://i.imgur.com/X7DSh.jpg
[23:17:22] <aqeel> why when i give saapce it says error to remove space and when i remove space it gives error to give space...ridiculous
[23:17:47] <shoky> aqeel: for what code
[23:19:28] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/wwQkf/
[23:20:03] <aqeel> any simple line too...
[23:21:50] <shoky> aqeel: its talking about the space after the {
[23:21:51] <shoky> on the first line
[23:21:54] <aqeel> if you write function(), it says to give space and write function (), but then it says error to remove space and write like this function()...
[23:22:16] <shoky> it wants: function () {
[23:22:22] <shoky> with no space after the {
[23:24:38] <shoky> aqeel: this is how it expects it-  http://pastie.org/5487575
[23:24:49] <shoky> but anyway.. there are flags you can unset
[23:26:36] <aqeel> got to go...bb
[23:28:09] <w00tner> its working yeah!
[23:28:27] <w00tner> in the part of style='font-size:40px'>"
[23:28:41] <w00tner> i want to replace the number for a variable
[23:28:56] <w00tner> its ok to do it like this: "<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' style='font-size: ' + letraSize + ' + px'>"
