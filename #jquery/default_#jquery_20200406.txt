[11:03:50] <jak2020> IS POSSIBLE CHANGE THE ID OF A INPUT TEXT?
[11:03:52] <jak2020> sorry for caps...
[11:04:11] <Cork> uh, sure just set the id attribute
[11:04:24] <Cork> .prop('id', 'new-id')
[11:09:01] <jak2020> thanks
[11:09:41] <jak2020> it ry change button text: $("#btnCambiar2").val('Agregar');  and  $("#btnCambiar2").prop('value', 'Agregar');
[11:09:42] <jak2020> not change
[11:10:43] <Cork> too little context, 1. what is the button, 2. are you sure there is only one element with that id?
[11:12:00] <jak2020> 1 bootstrap button 2) yes unique...
[11:12:16] <thykka> jak2020, if you're trying to change a button's text, use .text('Agregar'), not .val
[11:12:27] <Cork> if i remember correctly those aren't an input field, so .val() won't work
[11:13:00] <thykka> a button can have a value attribute, but that's the value sent with the form, not the button's text
[11:13:02] <Cork> ya, text() is "normally" a safer bet, but you might also have a dedicated api for doing it correctly
[11:13:25] <Cork> only if you use normal form submission, not for ajax
[11:13:35] <Cork> there button values makes no sense
[11:13:43] <jak2020> $("#btnCambiar2").text('Agregar');
[11:15:38] <jak2020> OK WORKED, THANKS
[11:15:47] <jak2020> oups sorry.... caps again
