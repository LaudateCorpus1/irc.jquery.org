[00:58:25] <Jattenalle> uh, why would an image trigger an error about a missing $ declaration?
[00:59:08] <Jattenalle> 09:58:56	JSConsole: http://p.gaicdn.com/?6,2048
[00:59:08] <Jattenalle> 09:58:56		:Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined [1]:
[00:59:08] <systemfault> Images don’t trigger errors.
[00:59:13] <Jattenalle> it sure does :/
[00:59:30] <user31> chrome -> developer tools-> heap snapshots shows me an increasing heap. how can I analyze the reason? does somebody know another place where I should ask?
[00:59:31] <Jattenalle> comment that out, no error
[01:03:39] <Jattenalle> systemfault, any ideas welcome, i am completely stumped.. like you say, it shouldnt...
[01:03:57] <systemfault> Jattenalle: You gave me a url with a picture.
[01:04:10] <systemfault> Jattenalle: There’s no JS running on a image.
[01:04:27] <Jattenalle> i know, but still, as you can see from the console output it triggers one anyhow, somehow...
[01:04:34] <systemfault> Not really.
[01:05:04] <Jattenalle> hm?
[01:05:04] <systemfault> Tried it with Firefox and Chrome
[01:05:53] <Jattenalle> you know, my bad, i'll go ask in the proper channel :)
[01:06:05] <Jattenalle> it happens when using CEF.. the chromium embedded thing
[01:06:20] <systemfault> Heh.
[01:06:50] <Jattenalle> pretty weird bug though
[01:06:51] * Jattenalle shrugs
[01:08:52] <Jattenalle> systemfault, hah, turns out i was being dumb, bug in my code logic
[01:09:18] <systemfault> I don’t know what is CEF but I’m glad you got it fixed.
[01:10:57] <Jattenalle> systemfault, it's a way to render webpages onto a texture surface so you can show it in a game as a UI for example
[01:11:11] <Jattenalle> i was sending javascript calls to the image <3
[01:11:27] <Jattenalle> so for once, the useless error message was completely correct!
[01:12:44] <sflw> systemfault: If an SMTP server is present at runtime for that php email script will it be engaged automatically when the email needs to be sent or do I need to point the script at a specific server?
[01:12:58] <sflw> I've been scouring the web and GoDaddy support for answers to this question and have come up with nothing conclusive.
[01:14:53] <systemfault> sflw: Setuping SMTP servers like postfix isn’t my cup of tea, sorry :/
[01:15:18] <sflw> systemfault: No sweat. I'll keep at it.
[02:38:44] <tasslehoff> I have a button that submits a form, and want a confirmation dialogue. Tried this: http://hastebin.com/siquqawazo.js . Didn't work. Should it, if my button has name="delete"?
[02:40:06] <dbt_> no, $(".delete") looks for something with a class of delete
[02:41:26] <tasslehoff> dbt_: ah. made myself a web page with node.js/express/jquery/bootstrap in all haste. it worked, but I'm using the slow summer weeks to try to understand what I am actually doing :)
[02:42:02] <dbt_> you can either add the class or target it with $('button[name="delete"]')
[02:42:07] <tasslehoff> dbt_: how would I look for a name or a value, and where should I have read this instead of bothering you?
[02:42:10] <tasslehoff> ah. thanks
[02:44:05] <dbt_> have a look at http://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/ the same css selectors can be transferred to jquery selectors
[02:46:06] <dbt_> or even http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[02:46:23] <tasslehoff> dbt_: thanks. that did not work for me, so I must be doing something else wrong. this is my jade template http://hastebin.com/lomipenizu.rb
[02:46:36] <tasslehoff> hope it's ok to use that pastebin
[02:49:51] <dbt_> not familiar with jade, looks like you're making a button with a data attribute - button.close(type='button', data-dismiss='alert')
[02:50:16] <dbt_> so maybe try and target that - $('button[data-dismiss="alert"]').click ...
[02:51:45] <tasslehoff> dbt_: the button I need is above that.
[02:51:55] <tasslehoff> download/delete.
[02:52:39] <dbt_> ahh, its an input not a <button>
[02:53:30] <dbt_> $('input[name="delete"]')
[02:54:04] <tasslehoff> aaaaahh. sorry, and thanks :)
[02:54:14] <dbt_> np
[02:55:26] <tasslehoff> and it works. now I just gotta see if I can find a prettier dialog than alert :)
[03:13:05] <justus> hi
[03:13:34] <justus> got a problem here with jqMobile, strangely $.noConflict(true) seems to be causing a multitude of problems instead of avoiding them
[03:14:44] <justus> is noConflict supported on mobile or not?
[03:59:54] <t432> i have to refresh page multiple times in order for the script changes to kick in, has anyone else experiances this with chrome?
[04:00:58] <decx> devtools, gear icon top right, general -> disable cache (while devtools is open)
[04:01:49] <t432> i have a the plugn acache killer
[04:02:02] <t432> cache killer, which i think serves the same purpose.
[04:02:12] <decx> apparently not
[04:02:22] <t432> i don;t seee the gear icon.
[04:02:39] <t432> i usually open it via a short cut
[04:06:23] <t432> got it.
[04:06:59] <Omar-> arschmitz: Hi
[04:07:57] <t432> that don;t work either.
[04:07:58] <t432> nvm
[05:04:43] <Omar-> hi
[05:05:14] <Omar-> Any jQM guru, need scond opinion in `pagebeforechange` event.
[05:05:19] <Omar-> second*
[05:11:39] <Omar-> hello?
[05:12:26] <Omar-> arschmitz: congrats on the new position
[05:25:29] <21WAAS1PC> Hello I want a list of records from mysql database using PHP and JQUERY.
[05:25:38] <sha1sum> Hey all... Is this a good place for turbolinks questions?
[05:26:11] <21WAAS1PC> What I want is 10 records in a page . and If I click a button then it should add up to 20
[05:26:18] <21WAAS1PC> Basic
[05:27:48] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: You could write the PHP to accept an "offset" query parameter and use the OFFSET keyword in your SQL query to pull the next 10 records based on how many are already shown (passing that with the count of items via jquery)
[05:28:34] <21WAAS1PC> Sorry dude I am a dumb fella. in jquery
[05:28:58] <petzup> http://jsfiddle.net/g3EU2/2/ why it wont color background red if i prss on tr?
[05:29:12] <21WAAS1PC> I have done some work on javascript and php but do not know much and the things I have implemented are not working
[05:30:06] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: sounds like you have some googling to do ;) search around for help with getting database records via PHP, counting items via jquery, and doing jquery ajax calls
[05:30:14] <Hausas> what happens if I call .show() on an element which is not hidden?
[05:30:31] <Hausas> does this make the world a living hell?
[05:30:44] <21WAAS1PC> I have done basic googing but not a fine answer or solution yet
[05:31:29] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: this is probably because you'll need to find answers to multiple questions in order to get things working...
[05:31:40] <flam_> Hausas, nothing iirc
[05:32:04] <21WAAS1PC> Yeah! I know that is why I am here
[05:32:09] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: basically if you break down your issue, you're going to need a PHP file which will get 10 database records and return the HTML that you want with the records displayed starting with record number 10, 20, etc.
[05:32:37] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: finding the next 10 records you can use the OFFSET SQL keyword to *start* at record 10, 20, etc.
[05:32:46] <21WAAS1PC> I have done that where can I post the php script
[05:32:47] <Hausas> Thanks, flam_
[05:33:05] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: then you will need to make a jquery ajax call that will call that PHP's URL and pass it the "offset" parameter via a $_GET variable (query param)
[05:33:35] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: you can use the jquery count() function to find out how many records are already displayed and that's your offset parameter
[05:33:38] <21WAAS1PC> I have come till here but I have no idea what to pass and where \
[05:33:44] <21WAAS1PC> Kinda lost
[05:33:46] <petzup> does anyone have idea how to solve my problem?
[05:34:26] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: take it piece-by-piece and start with the PHP file. Once you can get the PHP file returning the proper HTML, then you can begin the jquery part
[05:34:58] <21WAAS1PC> THanks but PHP part is done now it is time for JQUERY
[05:35:23] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: try this tutorial for the AJAX part: http://html.net/tutorials/javascript/lesson21.php
[05:35:38] <21WAAS1PC> Thanks buddy
[05:36:06] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: then, lets say your records are in a list where the ul element has an id of "recordsList", then you'd need something like:
[05:36:27] <sha1sum> $('#recordsList li').count()
[05:36:33] <21WAAS1PC> Yep right
[05:36:52] <sha1sum> ^--- that will get you the "offset" parameter you need to pass to your PHP URL, so it will look like http://example.com/more_records.php?offset=20
[05:37:28] <sha1sum> then in your SQL query you just add:  " OFFSET " . $_GET['offset']
[05:37:32] <sha1sum> ^--- to the end of the query
[05:38:01] <sha1sum> (with probably some checking for whether the offset query param is present, but that's the simple version)
[05:38:26] <21WAAS1PC> great answer thanks dude
[05:38:50] <sha1sum> np have fun :)
[05:39:30] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: btw sorry it's not count() it's .length
[05:39:39] <sha1sum> I get my languages mixed up lol
[05:39:50] <21WAAS1PC> Cool chil
[05:41:52] <21WAAS1PC> I will send my php scripts you look at them and give me a solution please'
[05:43:06] <sha1sum> 21WAAS1PC: little busy right now but check this out: http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_intro.asp
[05:43:51] <21WAAS1PC> Sorry , hp part is done but issue with jquery now

[06:08:28] <TheWhisper> Hi, all
[06:08:38] <TheWhisper> If I have this variable: var target = eventInfo.target || eventInfo.srcElement;
[06:08:55] <TheWhisper> how can I then check to see if the returned value includes certain words?
[06:09:19] <TheWhisper> I was thinking something like target.indexOf("word");, but this does not work.
[06:09:27] <TheWhisper> It says "TypeError: target.indexOf is not a function"
[06:11:14] <Jattenalle> TheWhisper, that's because it's an element
[06:11:40] <TheWhisper> hm
[06:11:47] <TheWhisper> Ah, the returned value is an element, you mean?
[06:12:07] <Jattenalle> try something like $(target).filter(':contains("something here")');
[06:12:19] <Jattenalle> not sure that'll work though, it depends on what exactly you mean by includes words
[06:17:43] <adv_> anyone can recommend a toggle button plugin?
[06:18:29] <t432> I have a field of type 'file' so file upload, i need to process some tasks when the file has been select and button 'open' has been clicked, is there an event for this?
[06:18:36] <t432> to*
[06:19:42] <TheWhisper> Jattenalle, don't think that works.
[06:20:17] <Jattenalle> TheWhisper, yeah, i didnt think it would.. but anyhow, target is an element, yeah.. so you need to actually get the contents of it i wager
[06:20:36] <Jattenalle> try adding a * to the filter
[06:20:46] <TheWhisper> Jattenalle: http://i.imgur.com/can6EYF.png
[06:20:50] <Jattenalle> var newlist = $(target).filter('*:contains("something here")');
[06:21:05] <io_____> hi when I try to auto open a colorbox with .click(), i get a double content, how can I fix that?
[06:27:05] <johannes__> Hello, I do get a wrong return from a query select when I call a selector in the document.ready function, after the function, I get the right selector: http://pastebin.com/ALAQ1dgK
[06:27:34] <johannes__> Can somebody explain that to me or can tell me what I have to search for to find more information?
[06:31:23] <johannes__> Does nobody have an idea, I thought this was a beginner question
[06:33:41] <adv_> anyone?
[07:03:33] <TheWhisper> If I use console.log(eventInfo.target) in Firefox on a page and then hit the back button, I get this value: "Window → http://website.com/page-I-went-back-to.html"
[07:03:59] <TheWhisper> Does anyone know how I can use that in an if() string?
[07:09:40] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: The URL?
[07:12:55] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, no, the "window" part
[07:13:05] <hlvwrk> BillCriswell:  you're a window
[07:14:57] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: where is eventInfo coming from?
[07:15:03] <BillCriswell> hlvwrk: True.
[07:15:09] <hlvwrk> 8)
[07:15:11] <BillCriswell> A big, snazzy Harry Clark glass one!
[07:15:21] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, what do you mean?
[07:16:28] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: You're logging eventInfo.target, where is eventInfo coming from?
[07:16:39] <TheWhisper> $(window).on('pronto.request', function(event, eventInfo){}
[07:20:56] <t432> i have input of type file which resides outside of the form.  when submitting the form can i submit this field as part of a multipart form using jquery?
[07:23:23] <t432> anyone?
[07:24:42] <adv_> i can't get https://github.com/simontabor/jquery-toggles to work , i have <script> $('.toggles').toggles({on:true});
[07:24:42] <adv_>  </script in <head> and <div class="toggles" data-toggle-on="true" data-toggle-height="20" data-toggle-width="60"></div> in <body>. why ?
[07:25:00] <adv_> </script>*
[07:29:34] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, any idea why this would happen also: http://notepad.cc/zbiacluga56
[07:29:45] <TheWhisper> The top one returns that value
[07:29:52] <TheWhisper> but the bottom one, which is one line after, returns a different value
[07:35:37] <t432> i have input of type file which resides outside of the form.  when submitting the form can i submit this field as part of a multipart form using jquery?
[07:43:16] <Sappy_> Hi. I`m looking for script, for my scroll down page. I need that front-page is fixed and page-two verticali hover over front-page.

[07:59:49] <BillCriswell> decx: Is that the Deku tree in the background?
[08:00:18] <decx> maybe, i took the assets from opengameart.org
[08:00:22] <BillCriswell> decx: Nice.
[08:00:28] <BillCriswell> decx: Ah, that was my next question.
[08:00:33] <AcidRain> i see no deku tree
[08:00:44] <decx> wanted to make a parallax that isnt overbearing
[08:00:48] <AcidRain> I SEE IT!
[08:00:49] <AcidRain> LOL
[08:00:50] <BillCriswell> AcidRain: All the way to the right.
[08:00:50] <decx> could be a nice header or footer
[08:01:32] <AcidRain> BillCriswell, actually, 4th tree from the left. has a face on it. that is more of a deku tree
[08:01:39] <AcidRain> i do however, see the tree u speak of
[08:01:42] <BillCriswell> decx: Have you tried getting it to work with tilting the device?
[08:01:43] <decx> subtle enough to not distract, but organic enough to look interesting
[08:02:02] <BillCriswell> AcidRain: That's the one I was talking about I think.
[08:02:11] <decx> hm nice idea
[08:02:15] <AcidRain> oh i thought u meant the one with the animal eyes
[08:02:31] <decx> i'm gonna pull a version on my network and play with that later
[08:02:39] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[08:03:00] <BillCriswell> I wish more games made use of that in little ways.
[08:03:05] <Agamemnus> hi
[08:03:06] <Agamemnus> ummmm
[08:03:21] <Agamemnus> doesn't $.ajax have a success parameter?
[08:03:33] <decx> yeah the most basic effect is really just a couple of images with relative motion to each other
[08:03:34] <BillCriswell> Agamemnus: It can, but you should probably use .done()
[08:03:45] <Agamemnus> why?
[08:03:55] <BillCriswell> Agamemnus: It's what the docs suggest.
[08:04:01] <Agamemnus> i am seeing this, seems like ppl are changing the api for no good reason every year
[08:04:05] <MikeD_> if I have an array of jquery objects, can I do parent.append( myArray ) ?
[08:04:06] <BillCriswell> You can do $.ajax({success: function() { }); for now.
[08:04:20] <BillCriswell> Agamemnus: I'm sure there's a good reason for it.
[08:04:54] <BillCriswell> araujo: One off the top of my head would be you could chain .done()
[08:05:14] <Agamemnus> Is there an "error" callback?
[08:05:17] <BillCriswell> Agamemnus: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8840257/jquery-ajax-handling-continue-responses-success-vs-done good first answer here.
[08:05:26] <BillCriswell> Agamemnus: I think it's .fail()
[08:05:38] <BillCriswell> then .always() would be either.
[08:06:01] <Agamemnus> a callback parameter
[08:06:14] <BillCriswell> decx: http://www.fireproofgames.com/the-room this game used the gyroscope or whatever that thingie is in there in fun ways.
[08:06:15] <shoky> yes, there is
[08:06:27] <thebope>  wow that fiddle is really cool decx
[08:06:27] <Agamemnus> I guess only for $.ajax not for $.post
[08:06:30] <shoky> there's both success and error and they're fine to use
[08:06:35] <Agamemnus> I wonder why $.post doesn't have error?
[08:06:39] <decx> the room hehe
[08:06:47] <decx> I DID NOT HIT HER
[08:06:51] <shoky> Agamemnus because $.post is just a shortcut for $.ajax
[08:07:08] <shoky> Agamemnus and you an still use the promises API with $.post
[08:07:13] <shoky> e.g.  .fail
[08:07:17] <Agamemnus> but does $.post have the "error" callback?
[08:07:24] <Agamemnus> I'm looking at docs, not seeing it
[08:07:26] <shoky> it does not have an "error" option, no
[08:07:36] <shoky> but it still returns a promise you can call .fail on
[08:07:40] <Agamemnus> I wonder why. doesn't sound logical
[08:07:53] <Agamemnus> gotcha but why wouldn't it have an error callback?
[08:07:54] <thebope> decx, yea I wasn't really prepared. It's tough living in NYC, there is something going on pretty much *every* day
[08:07:58] <shoky> it HAS an error callback
[08:08:04] <shoky> $.post().fail(callback)
[08:08:13] <Agamemnus> that's not an error callback
[08:08:16] <shoky> yes it is
[08:08:20] <Agamemnus> don't lie to me man
[08:08:29] <Agamemnus> i'm itchy with the trigger finger
[08:08:35] <Agamemnus> yeah yeah BUT
[08:08:39] <Agamemnus> Ignore .fail
[08:08:44] <shoky> anyways $.post is just a convenience shortcut for $.ajax
[08:08:46] <Agamemnus> .fail is recent
[08:08:49] <shoky> "recent"
[08:08:53] <Agamemnus> so before .fail, what did it have?
[08:09:07] <shoky> it's since jquery 1.5
[08:09:11] <Agamemnus> bwaaaa
[08:09:20] <shoky> before .fail there was $.ajax which has an "error" option
[08:09:36] <decx> thebope work on that "uuh", and don't do the "hey at least i'm going up here" thing, that never works out. and practise practise practise in front of the mirror, i learned that from the sims 2
[08:09:39] <Agamemnus> ok, so why keep success and not keep error?
[08:09:47] <BillCriswell> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naBEfHzGxXM
[08:09:49] <shoky> and also maybe you could still call promise-like methods on $.post  like  .error(..)
[08:09:50] <Agamemnus> doesn't make sense to me.. not logical. It's a fail
[08:09:51] <thebope> hahaha
[08:09:57] <thebope> I got some laughs out of that actually
[08:10:01] <thebope> but yea I blanked pretty bad haha
[08:10:14] <BillCriswell> thebope: Definitely a lot better than the last one.
[08:10:21] <thebope> haha yea, a lot better for sure
[08:10:21] <decx> laughs are easy, i go for gasps
[08:10:25] <shoky> Agamemnus:  there was jqXHR.success() .error() .complete()
[08:10:26] <Agamemnus> Ok, man. Thanks
[08:11:03] <thebope> lol
[08:11:31] <thebope> boom 106 views
[08:11:43] <thebope> next step is four digits
[08:11:50] <BillCriswell> Watch out, Chris Rock.

[08:18:07] <AcidRain> i miss kvirc
[08:19:15] <AcidRain> they make it for windows!
[08:23:28] <zquad> I want to  post a file to an api and started using new FormData() only to learn that ie9 doesn't support it.  How can I post a file using ajax that works in IE9?
[08:27:24] <t432> why is this string comparison failing? http://pastebin.com/x9u4FeDj
[08:27:47] <t432> there is a match on 'jpg' and yet it still enters the block;
[08:28:24] <konradb_> hi, I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/3ctKT/2/ How can I change it, to exec only when <a> is inside <td class=" username or email?
[08:29:11] <BillCriswell> t432: var extension = $.trim(tokens[tLen-1]); for starters.
[08:29:46] <BillCriswell> Then console.log(extension, extension.length); and make sure it's what you think it is.
[08:30:24] <t432> i have the variable, i was being succinct
[08:30:29] <t432> let me get pastebin
[08:31:06] <t432> http://pastebin.com/yW13ZwYY
[08:32:00] <BillCriswell> t432: I think you want && and not ||.
[08:32:38] <t432> aha
[08:33:10] <t432> BillCriswell: i have input of type file which resides outside of the form.  when submitting the form can i submit this field as part of a multipart form using jquery?
[08:33:10] <decx> not OR not always makes trouble
[08:33:32] <decx> if it's not not is probably not not not, so do not do that
[08:33:43] <decx> you not what i'm saying
[08:33:48] <BillCriswell> t432: Also, some other approaches, you can do like if($.inArray(extension, ['jpg', 'png', 'foo', 'bar') === -1) {}
[08:35:04] <BillCriswell> or even extension.match(/^jpeg|png|gif$/)
[08:35:18] <BillCriswell> I think the inArray would be the most logical way though.
[08:35:35] <t432> yep
[08:35:40] <BillCriswell> t432: You can move the input into the form on submit.
[08:36:02] <BillCriswell> I'd try to get the input in there in the html though. Shouldn't be messing with the DOM too much.
[08:36:39] <BillCriswell> decx: Well said. Clear as day haha
[08:37:43] <decx> not bad huh ^^
[08:37:50] <t432> BillCriswell: can I get a jsfiddle?
[08:38:49] <BillCriswell> t432: $('#file-input').appendTo($('#some-form'))
[08:39:24] <t432> thats all?
[08:39:39] <BillCriswell> Basically.
[08:39:39] <AcidRain> test
[08:39:47] <Germanaz0> Hello everybody, is there a possiblity to detect if the firefox browser has X extension enabled ?
[08:39:57] <Germanaz0> using just javascript
[08:41:39] <BillCriswell> t432: http://jsbin.com/cafero/1/edit?html,js,output my quick test case.
[08:42:55] <BillCriswell> Germanaz0: It looks like there's a navigator.plugins array you can go through.. haven't played with that one though.
[08:43:14] <Germanaz0> yes but it doesn't give the full list
[08:43:15] <Germanaz0> :s
[08:43:16] <Germanaz0> but thnx
[08:43:30] <decx> that name makes me uncomfortable
[08:44:33] <BillCriswell> decx: It's almost there.
[08:44:58] <BillCriswell> console.table(navigator.plugins, ['name', 'description']);
[08:45:02] <BillCriswell> mm, love console.table
[08:46:46] <BillCriswell> Germanaz0: I'm not sure I'd like someone to be able to get a hold of the plugins I have installed, but I can see it may be useful.
[08:47:27] <blakespot> What is the latest verson of jQuery -- or the best version -- to run under IE8?
[08:47:42] <BillCriswell> blakespot: 1.11 is the old IE branch haha
[08:47:42] <blakespot> Trying to get my broken menu system working under IE8
[08:47:45] <Germanaz0> BillCriswell, imagine that you have a site, and there is a plugin taking proffit of your site :D
[08:47:49] <blakespot> 1.11.0 I have here
[08:47:52] <blakespot> so that?
[08:48:05] <BillCriswell> Yes. That should be ok in old IE.
[08:48:12] <blakespot> I despise IE8
[08:48:17] <BillCriswell> Germanaz0: Yeah, that would suck.
[08:48:48] <AcidRain> i too despise IE
[08:48:56] <AcidRain> i block all IE users from all of my sites
[08:48:57] <AcidRain> <3
[08:50:58] <blakespot> What is the version I should be using for modern browsers?
[08:51:06] <BillCriswell> 2.x
[08:51:14] <blakespot> Right now just using 1.11.0 across all
[08:51:24] <duch_kazatel> we just updated to 1.11
[08:51:30] <duch_kazatel> well, on one of our sites.
[08:51:40] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Smooth?
[08:52:09] <duch_kazatel> we went from 1.8.3 and had some pain points largely because people didn't know the difference between .prop(), .attr(), and .data()
[08:52:28] <duch_kazatel> and we had some people doing things like running $(document).append(), which fails now, but didn't used to.
[08:53:00] <duch_kazatel> once you get into the groove though you're fine.
[08:53:02] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Interesting. Haven't seen anything try $(document).append()
[08:53:10] <duch_kazatel> yeah, there's a reason for that.
[08:53:35] <decx> is that like a less archaic version of document.write
[08:53:45] <duch_kazatel> nope.  it doesn't do anything.
[08:54:03] <duch_kazatel> you can't append to the document object.  it used to just silently do nothing.  now you get an error.
[08:54:24] <decx> ah, it did nothing
[08:55:12] <duch_kazatel> if you generally write things in an even semi-modular, semi-functional, semi-sane way, you'll be fine.
[09:01:34] <fonsA2> Hello. I'm trying to figure out how to create a cookie value/selection on a select option. If a user makes a selection I need to make it change/create the cookie upon selection. If the user returns back I need it to choose the selection saved in the cookie. I have a script which works for the checkbox but need to figure out how to edit it to make it work with the select/option. Code here: http://pastebin.com/kGFDbCQA
[09:04:07] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 change it to target the change event of the select instead.
[09:04:21] <duch_kazatel> set the .val() of the select to whatever option you want.
[09:06:21] <fonsA2> If the value is set on the the select it'll automatically select that dropdown?
[09:06:27] <fonsA2> selection.
[09:06:36] <duch_kazatel> it should.
[09:06:44] <duch_kazatel> also, don't use .attr('value') - use .val() instead
[09:07:16] <blakespot> I am using jQ 1.11 and under IE8 my jQ-driven left nav fly-outs don't. --> http://parentalcontrols.qa.cble.co
[09:07:47] <blakespot> If these work under jQ 1.11 on modern browsers, I Would think they would work under IE8
[09:07:58] <fonsA2> var mycookie = $.cookie($(this).val());
[09:08:00] <fonsA2> like this?
[09:08:29] <duch_kazatel> one sec i'll show you.
[09:08:31] <decx> fonsA2 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/2SMGX/
[09:10:18] <fonsA2> thanks decx. Ill see if it works
[09:10:35] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Pc2f2/1/
[09:10:36] <duch_kazatel> there
[09:10:37] <duch_kazatel> this works
[09:10:44] <duch_kazatel> or at least it should.
[09:10:57] <decx> it doesnt
[09:11:22] <decx> oh because rawgit
[09:11:24] <BillCriswell> Cookies are so 2001.
[09:11:25] <decx> nevermind
[09:11:30] <decx> cdnjs ffs
[09:11:57] <duch_kazatel> via http://rawgit.com/ should be find shouldn't it?
[09:12:09] <decx> i dont have rawgit on my js whitelist
[09:12:14] <decx> too much shit
[09:12:17] <fonsA2> @BillCriswell ;-)
[09:12:35] <duch_kazatel> hah
[09:13:02] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Pc2f2/2/ for decx
[09:13:40] <fonsA2> for me or decx?
[09:13:44] <duch_kazatel> both ;)
[09:13:56] <decx> you have to put in a fallback for no cookie
[09:13:57] <duch_kazatel> same thing as what i pasted earlier, just a different link for the plugin
[09:14:05] <duch_kazatel> good point.
[09:14:07] <decx> or else please select wont be there without a cookie
[09:14:35] <fonsA2> Awesome. It works.
[09:14:39] <fonsA2> Thanks guys.
[09:14:44] <duch_kazatel> put in that fallback though.
[09:15:33] <duch_kazatel> something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Pc2f2/3/
[09:16:31] <decx> there you go
[09:17:21] <decx> duch_kazatel check out this sweet header with assets from opengameart http://jsfiddle.net/decx/37wRU/show/
[09:17:41] <duch_kazatel> jesus dude
[09:17:46] <duch_kazatel> you build the neatest shit
[09:18:02] <decx> it looks cool, but check the draw function
[09:18:10] <decx> it's extremely simple
[09:18:15] <decx> hence parallazy
[09:19:19] <BillCriswell> fonsA2: http://jsbin.com/fucineho/1/edit this might be useful.
[09:19:56] <blakespot> To hell with Foundation
[09:19:57] <wunz> wow decx, that's amazing, i need to learn those stuff
[09:20:15] <BillCriswell> decx: What happened with the spider webs?
[09:20:23] <wunz> blakespot: why? isn't it supposed the best fluid responsive fw out there
[09:20:32] <decx> not much BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/decx/e8KZQ/5/
[09:20:50] <BillCriswell> Ended up looking more like broken glass.
[09:20:55] <decx> indeed
[09:21:12] <decx> like i said, it needs structurally sound outwards lines
[09:21:40] <BillCriswell> Word.
[09:21:43] <decx> not this teardrop in wireframewater thing
[09:21:46] <fonsA2> Bill With the localstorage script posted...will it save all values found in the form?
[09:21:53] <decx> but i bet you could animate it for that
[09:22:59] <decx> wunz just do it ^^
[09:23:07] <BillCriswell> fonsA2: Yes. That way you can write a simple function to look it up.
[09:23:18] <fonsA2> I see that it does store the values. How would I go about displaying it back?
[09:23:24] <fonsA2> Do you have a link/reference.
[09:23:31] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn localstorage
[09:23:32] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: DOM Storage guide - Web developer guide | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage
[09:24:33] <BillCriswell> fonsA2: The values are there. When you're reading it you would need to parse the json so you can look through it.
[09:25:27] <BillCriswell> fonsA2: http://jsbin.com/fucineho/2/edit a little more clearer of an example.
[09:26:26] <fonsA2> console.table(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('form')));
[09:26:33] <fonsA2> that line will bring back all the form values?
[09:26:41] <BillCriswell> fonsA2: No, just displays them.
[09:27:27] <fonsA2> Do I need to parse through all individual elements or can I do it in one line of code somehow
[09:27:34] <fonsA2> like a restore form.
[09:27:46] <BillCriswell> fonsA2: https://gist.github.com/crswll/7905125 I wrote this a while back that would take that array and restore the values to the form.
[09:27:56] <duch_kazatel> you'll need to enumerate through the JSON and set the individual elements.
[09:28:50] <BillCriswell> I should make that more pluginish.
[09:29:14] <fonsA2> That's kind of tedious. I have a form with a lot of elements.
[09:29:26] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 not at all.  it's a simple for loop.
[09:29:30] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that'd be a neat idea.
[09:29:42] <BillCriswell> fonsA2: The code I posted in the gist does just that.
[09:29:59] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah, $form.populate(formData) makes a lot more sense haha
[09:31:35] <BillCriswell> I really need to start putting things on githhub.
[09:35:13] <fonsA2> found this: http://shaneriley.com/jquery/remember_state/
[09:35:34] <duch_kazatel> it'd be good practice to write it yourself btw :)
[09:35:51] <shekib82_> this is a developer help channel?
[09:35:57] <duch_kazatel> shekib82_ yep.
[09:36:00] <shekib82_> cool
[09:36:03] <duch_kazatel> for jquery, at least.
[09:36:13] <shekib82_> first time i notice these channels
[09:36:24] <shekib82_> i work jquery java spring mvc during the day
[09:36:34] <shekib82_> if i come here and i have a question, people could help me?
[09:36:40] <duch_kazatel> with jquery, yes.
[09:36:44] <fonsA2> Why should I write it myself when I have you guys my minions write it for me!
[09:36:44] <shekib82_> cool
[09:36:46] <fonsA2> I kid. haha
[09:37:08] <shekib82_> i have a question. I have this jquery datatable i want to be able to create columns dynamically.
[09:37:22] <aboudreault> hey, I'm playing with something simple, I do a $(elem).append(myString); but the html of myString is not visible. What could cause that?
[09:37:34] <aboudreault> also tried $(myString)
[09:37:35] <shekib82_> the data that comes will have in every row a number of key value pairs. i want to put the keys as columns and the values in the rows
[09:37:37] <duch_kazatel> aboudreault your selector isn't valid.
[09:37:51] <aboudreault> my selector is valid, I see it correctly.
[09:37:55] <duch_kazatel> shekib82_ datatable's site has info on this: http://www.datatables.net/examples/api/add_row.html
[09:38:03] <duch_kazatel> aboudreault could you share a fiddle of what you're doing then?
[09:38:16] <aboudreault> when I do selector.html, looks like I see my code... but as string
[09:38:47] <shekib82_> yeah, but here's the deal i want to add columns not rows
[09:39:10] <shekib82_> when you set up the datatable you set the columns. i want to be able to add columns based on the data i get
[09:39:33] <duch_kazatel> shekib82_ https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/12270/dynamically-add-remove-columns-datatables-warning-requested-unknown-parameter
[09:41:39] <aboudreault> duch_kazatel, that's what I do: http://jsfiddle.net/5QAKD/
[09:42:19] <duch_kazatel> you don't need the .html() on the end of that btw.
[09:43:00] <aboudreault> ok
[09:44:12] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/5QAKD/1/ <- works, see?
[09:46:00] <aboudreault> duch_kazatel, my #light-child-template is a <script type="text/template">. That's probably why.
[09:46:14] <aboudreault> will parse it with _
[09:46:41] <duch_kazatel> bwuh. okay
[09:53:46] <ilgioooo> hello
[09:54:04] <ilgioooo> http://www.agriturismosacanudera.it/temp/1/1.html
[09:54:07] <ilgioooo> please
[09:54:35] <ilgioooo> when i return on 1.html and go to 2.html
[09:55:13] <ilgioooo> it create another chart bottom
[09:55:16] <ilgioooo> why?
[09:55:18] <duch_kazatel> you're appending in contenteven if you don't need to.
[09:55:22] <duch_kazatel> $(document).on('pageshow', '#2', function(){
[09:55:35] <duch_kazatel> you're pluggin' in new content without checking to see if you actually need to.
[09:56:48] <ilgioooo> what do i do to resolv?
[09:57:14] <duch_kazatel> set a bool somewhere to see if you set it and check that on pageload.
[09:57:38] <ilgioooo> mmm
[09:58:36] <ilgioooo> i want to create this chart every time to show this page
[09:58:42] <ilgioooo> how do i do?
[09:58:50] <duch_kazatel> that's exactly what you're doing now.
[09:58:56] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want to recreate it?
[09:59:16] <ilgioooo> no
[09:59:32] <ilgioooo> only one
[09:59:47] <duch_kazatel> not making any sense then.
[10:00:00] <ilgioooo> in page without query i have a document.ready
[10:00:12] <ilgioooo> but in jquerymobile it is not work
[10:00:41] <duch_kazatel> lol still not making sense.
[10:01:10] <ilgioooo> how
[10:01:12] <ilgioooo> ?
[10:03:43] <ilgioooo> duch_kazatel,  help me
[10:06:55] <duch_kazatel> explain what you want to do.
[10:07:35] <ilgioooo> i want only one chart
[10:07:52] <ilgioooo> also if i back to 1 and go to 2
[10:09:33] <fonsA2> So I got the localstorage to save my values with the jquery_remember_state script I found but before values are restored it pops a restore value message of: Do you want to restore your previously entered info?. So you have to click the link before anything restores. How would I get it to automatically input fields without that dialog. http://jsfiddle.net/XJz76/
[10:09:49] <fonsA2> script here: http://shaneriley.com/jquery/remember_state/
[10:09:50] <duch_kazatel> ilgioooo create a boolean defaulted to false.  when you load page 2 and load the chart, set it to true.  check that boolean on pageload.
[10:11:54] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 i'm not seeing any options for that in there.  might want to roll your own.
[10:12:26] <fonsA2> I'm going in! Good thing I have you guys if I need help.
[10:12:43] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell posted an example for you earlier.  pretty simple stuff.
[10:15:09] <ilgioooo> duch_kazatel,  do you have a example?
[10:15:26] <ilgioooo> I am beginer
[10:15:43] <duch_kazatel> ilgioooo give it a shot and tell me when you get stuck.
[10:17:25] <ilgioooo> but doesn't exist a possibility to refresh page when I'm coming from page 1.html?
[10:17:45] <ilgioooo> as th document.ready()
[10:18:19] <decx> whats the problem
[10:18:25] <vitkovsky> guys. how can i take second element in jquery object?
[10:18:26] <duch_kazatel> i can't tell at this point.
[10:18:35] <duch_kazatel> vitkovsky .eq(1)
[10:18:50] <duch_kazatel> or .get(1) depending on what you're doing.
[10:19:03] <vitkovsky> what get returns?
[10:19:18] <decx> get returns an array with natives
[10:20:09] <vitkovsky> i try like that $('el')[1], but methods dont work
[10:20:20] <decx> that's the same as get
[10:20:25] <decx> or sameish
[10:20:35] <ilgioooo> boo
[10:20:37] <ilgioooo> :_(
[10:20:42] <decx> if you want to use jq methods use eq
[10:20:51] <duch_kazatel> vitkovsky right, because [1] gets the underlying dom method.
[10:21:02] <duch_kazatel> ilgioooo we're not going to do it for you.  at least try, duder.
[10:21:04] <vitkovsky> explain
[10:21:06] <vitkovsky> thx
[10:21:20] <duch_kazatel> .eq(1) if you want to run jquery methods against the thing.
[10:21:30] <duch_kazatel> *err, underlying dom node, not method.
[10:22:21] <BillCriswell> I just destroyed a sandwich.
[10:22:31] <BillCriswell> That was close to perfect.
[10:23:09] <decx> may the lord have mercy on you
[10:23:17] <duch_kazatel> that sounds awesome.
[10:23:25] <decx> the lord of sandwiches that is
[10:23:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Thinking about the spider web stuff. The lines coming from the center should definitely be straight.
[10:23:47] <decx> bezsubbub
[10:24:15] <decx> yeah that's what i mean with outwards lines havign to hold the structure
[10:24:40] <BillCriswell> Oh I thought you meant the web would need to be attached to a structure.
[10:26:02] <decx> well if they just grow outwards then they could reach something that holds them
[10:26:08] <decx> either polygons or the outer bounds
[10:26:09] <decx> like
[10:26:19] <decx> like this http://ncase.me/sight-and-light/draft4.html
[10:26:20] <BillCriswell> Right, that's more what I thought you meant.
[10:26:47] <decx> but the math on that is... well... let's just say still beyond my understanding
[10:26:48] <decx> ^^
[10:27:25] <BillCriswell> I hear that
[10:27:37] <decx> T2 = (r_dx*(s_py-r_py) + r_dy*(r_px-s_px))/(s_dx*r_dy - s_dy*r_dx)
[10:27:41] <decx> ok !
[10:28:00] <duch_kazatel> :(
[10:29:52] <decx> more like :o
[10:30:23] <BillCriswell> decx: I following you up to the = sign.
[10:30:47] <BillCriswell> The + symbol adds shit together.
[10:30:54] <BillCriswell> You're welcome.
[10:30:55] <ilgioooo> it work!
[10:30:57] <ilgioooo> http://www.agriturismosacanudera.it/temp/1/1.html
[10:31:35] <ilgioooo> too bed, the code it is duplicate
[10:31:37] <ilgioooo> :(
[10:31:56] <xelra> Guys, I have a problem. I am modifying the background of a div with "cover", then I want to apply css to move the background image around. Problem, I need to know how big the background image is now, because I need to align the bottom of the background with the bottom of the div, before scrolling. I thought, maybe I could get the computed size of the background by using something like this:
[10:32:18] <xelra> alert($('#philosophy').css('background-size'));
[10:32:39] <decx> don't use cover but absolute values
[10:33:02] <PantsOfChoco> come on decx thats simple derivatives and integrals
[10:33:06] <ilgioooo> duch_kazatel, do you see?
[10:33:45] <decx> PantsOfChoco objection, filibuster!
[10:34:14] <xelra> Not using cover has the problem, that the background image doesn't adjust to the size of the window anymore though. :(
[10:34:42] <BillCriswell> decx studies bird law.
[10:35:05] <BillCriswell> Has been, for many fort nights.
[10:35:24] <PantsOfChoco> someone posted a harvey birdman reference on reddit today and i was happy, even though you are going for always sunny
[10:35:38] <xelra> I even tried pure js like this: alert(getComputedStyle(philosophyDiv).getPropertyValue("background"));    In hopes that it would actually give me computed styles. But it also returns "cover".
[10:35:58] <decx> yes, this is my dissertation http://i.imgur.com/7GcqTYt.jpg
[10:37:01] <duch_kazatel> don't use alert() btw
[10:37:18] <decx> that's why you use the values you can get with javascript instead of cover xelra like element height, width
[10:37:21] <BillCriswell> Charlie is so wirse.
[10:37:28] <BillCriswell> wise* even
[10:37:41] <decx> background-size: 500px 300px
[10:37:46] <decx> something like that
[10:38:05] <decx> or you know, canvas
[10:38:16] <decx> *peddle*
[10:38:22] <ilgioooo> duch_kazatel, did you see?
[10:38:34] <duch_kazatel> ilgioooo i saw that you complained but didn't ask any questions.
[10:38:55] <PantsOfChoco> DO YOU SEE?! http://www.quickmeme.com/img/aa/aa5187be1a5ed53be2f890e3a04cf1352c9369aa99d51a97388a6c18944a4aa1.jpg
[10:39:14] <decx> we don take too kindly to that sort of thing
[10:39:38] <BillCriswell> we don't take kindly to people not taking kindly round here.
[10:39:47] <decx> hehe yeah that was the best
[10:39:48] <duch_kazatel> derk a durr
[10:40:32] <BillCriswell> So much respect for those guys.
[10:40:43] <PantsOfChoco> haha i cant help iglioo but i can enjoy that just saying do you see reminds me of that
[10:40:57] <PantsOfChoco> theyve been going on for so damn long now
[10:41:10] <fonsA2> Comic Con is down the street from me. Are you guys jealous?
[10:41:22] <ilgioooo> my code is right? that's what you mean?
[10:41:54] <duch_kazatel> lol i have no idea what's going on any more weeee
[10:43:44] <BillCriswell> I have a lot of nerdy friends that would be jealous.
[10:43:51] <decx> BillCriswell the respect took a bump when southparkstudios.com was hulufied
[10:44:01] <decx> dump*
[10:44:58] <BillCriswell> decx: I always watched in on Netflix or on Comedy Central. What's the issue with hulu over what they were doing before?
[10:45:16] <decx> it's shit
[10:45:55] <duch_kazatel> it's not free.
[10:46:12] <BillCriswell> It seems like you can still watch the episodes at southparkstudios?
[10:46:21] <duch_kazatel> they're removing that iirc.
[10:46:49] <BillCriswell> That would be lame.
[10:50:13] <Peter_Occ> I have read lots of pages but I just just understand how to get "on" working. It works initially with $(".editField").on("click",function(event){, but apparently I need to add a selected as in $(".editField").on("click",selector,function(event){ The problem is I don't understand what to use for "selector". Can anyone please explain how to figure that out?
[10:51:10] <Peter_Occ> It works without the selector, but not for dynamically created elements
[10:51:31] <duch_kazatel> Peter_Occ flip that.
[10:51:43] <duch_kazatel> if you use that second syntaxt, you need to bind to a parent element.
[10:52:38] <Peter_Occ> can I refer to the parent element with a class or does it have to be id specific?
[10:52:46] <duch_kazatel> there are two basic versions: $(elementThatEmitsEvent).on('event', function() {}); and $(parentThatExists).on('event', 'anyChildThatEmitsEvent', function() {});
[10:52:55] <duch_kazatel> it can be any selector you want.
[10:54:24] <Peter_Occ> By parent element, do you mean a parent of the initial selector? That would be $(".editField")
[10:54:34] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[10:54:41] <Peter_Occ> a parent of $(".editField")
[10:54:47] <duch_kazatel> yes
[10:54:48] <duch_kazatel> any parent that exists at time of bindng, usually
[10:54:53] <duch_kazatel> let me show you.
[10:55:33] <Peter_Occ> I've tried that but then it doesn't work at all.
[10:55:39] <duch_kazatel> i'll show you.
[10:56:13] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Hx4Mf/2/
[10:56:17] <duch_kazatel> see that second block?
[10:56:22] <duch_kazatel> $('#menu').on('click', 'a', function(e) {
[10:57:22] <duch_kazatel> replace 'a' with '.editField' and $('#menu') with whatever parent you have that exists on pageload.
[10:58:13] <xelra> Well, after reading up on the .css() method, I think it's a bug. It shouldn't return cover, but the computed style instead. :(  Guess I will have to look for something else. :(
[10:58:43] <duch_kazatel> if you think you have a bug, head over to #jquery-dev and chat with them.
[11:00:31] <Peter_Occ> Ok, I get it now, the initial selector has to be the parent and the other selector is the child.
[11:00:38] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[11:01:44] <Peter_Occ> Thank you for the help
[11:02:22] <duch_kazatel> did you read the docs about direct vs. delegated events?
[11:06:51] <DeliriumTremens> i swear FileReader is the most unreliable hunk of...
[11:07:51] <systemfault> Never had an issue with it.
[11:07:52] <systemfault> :/
[11:08:18] <DeliriumTremens> ive been using the same file to test...and sometimes it will load the text, other times it doesnt
[11:08:21] <DeliriumTremens> with the same code
[11:08:24] <DeliriumTremens> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:09:04] <Peter_Occ> Yes, I read it at least 5 times.
[11:18:14] <duch_kazatel> kay
[11:19:55] <BillCriswell> DeliriumTremens: Can the file be like... locked or something?
[11:20:07] <duch_kazatel> race condition maybe?
[11:21:57] <DeliriumTremens> BillCriswell: i think i figured out what was wrong... misunderstanding on my part
[11:22:10] <DeliriumTremens> as usually happens -.-
[11:22:17] <duch_kazatel> to all of us.
[11:22:25] <BillCriswell> Yeah definitely.
[11:23:00] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell what was that thing you had that sped up sass compilation?
[11:23:21] <BillCriswell> libsass
[11:23:25] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[11:24:01] <BillCriswell> Not quite the feature set of Ruby Sass of as right now but I'll take the speed of it over the feature set haha.
[11:27:26] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: If you want it like.. fucking instantly there's http://usetakana.com/
[11:36:21] <duch_kazatel> oooh.
[11:36:31] <duch_kazatel> we have a semi-convoluted setup, but that might work.
[11:38:34] <BillCriswell> Yeah I remmeber you saying your Sass compile times are crazy.
[11:38:41] <BillCriswell> At greater than 4 seconds I kind of want to cry.
[11:39:04] <duch_kazatel> i dream of 4 seconds.
[11:40:05] <systemfault> Anything really good missing from libsass?
[11:40:17] <duch_kazatel> we use compass.
[11:40:20] <BillCriswell> systemfault: maps didn't exist last time I checked.
[11:40:29] <duch_kazatel> so we'd have to do a bunch of work to not break shit,.
[11:40:46] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah. I probably wouldn't switch to libsass if you're using compass haha
[11:41:03] <voronika> I need to stop reading the word libsass
[11:41:49] <BillCriswell> voronika: Why?
[11:42:02] <voronika> cause, apparently I'm 12
[11:42:14] <BillCriswell> The "ass" on the end?
[11:45:25] <voronika> it took me at least three tries before i noticed it said sass.  I should integrate some css extension into my next project.
[11:45:39] <voronika> It's something i've been lacking.
[11:49:11] <BillCriswell> voronika: Sass is addictive.
[11:49:53] <ngl> Hello. I'm having a bitch of a time dealing with ko + bootstrap + jquery when it comes to bootstrap modals - only in Chrome. I've determined the problem is that on modal-show a div is appended to the body, but my modals are within a templated model (and need to be for ko bindings) with an outer fixed position div. The backdrop actually shows over the modal. I started grabbing the modals and...
[11:49:54] <ngl> ...putting them on the same DOM level as the backdrop... (.appendTo("body"))... and that works, but optimally I'd just grab the single backdrop div and slap that into my template. BUT, I keep getting "undefined is not a function" although $(".modal-backdrop.fade.in")[0] shows me there is a div.
[11:50:00] <b-ot> ngl: justgrabthesinglebackdropdivandslapthatintomytempl.at - ☺ AVAILABLE
[11:50:57] <duch_kazatel> ngl what are you running the method against?
[11:51:23] <ngl> Hi, duch, that is just from dev tools on Chrome.
[11:51:37] <duch_kazatel> right - which means you're running a method against something.
[11:51:42] <duch_kazatel> can you share some code?
[11:51:45] <ngl> sure
[11:51:51] <duch_kazatel> or tell us what line it's throwing the error on?

[11:58:20] <pinholecamera> hey folks... can anyone recommend a good method/plugin for cross-device drag-scroll? i want to vertically drag a child div inside of an overflow: hidden parent container to scroll the contents
[11:58:36] <pinholecamera> been having a really hard time figuring it out or tracking down a modern solution
[12:01:47] <decx> the one twitch uses pinholecamera
[12:01:58] <pinholecamera> decx: twitch?
[12:03:34] <decx> pinholecamera https://github.com/jnicol/trackpad-scroll-emulator
[12:03:55] <pinholecamera> decx: thanks!
[12:07:33] <ngl> Okay, I pasted my logs into the code. I can't get this to work, but thought it'd be sooo simple! http://fixee.org/paste/9zw13dx/
[12:08:09] <duch_kazatel> backdrop.appendTo('#' + self.modalHolderId); is your problem.
[12:08:15] <duch_kazatel> because htspeed.btrgla.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)

[12:08:26] <duch_kazatel> woops - because var backdrop = $(".modal-backdrop.fade.in")[0]; isn't what you think it is
[12:08:51] <duch_kazatel> you want var backdrop = $(".modal-backdrop.fade.in").eq(0); instead
[12:09:00] <ngl> Oh
[12:09:02] <ngl> Cool
[12:09:18] <duch_kazatel> what you have now is accessing the underlying DOM node, which doesn't have jquery methods attached to it.
[12:09:49] <ngl> :) Cause setTimeout didn't fix it either. Well, thank you very much. Kinda new to jQuery still.
[12:12:41] <duch_kazatel> and now you know.
[12:13:41] <PantsOfChoco> and knowing is half the battle!
[12:13:49] <PantsOfChoco> GGGG IIII JOOOOOOOOOOOE

[12:18:46] <decx> how is that 10 minutes
[12:18:55] <duch_kazatel> there are a lot of them.

[12:20:41] <synesp> hey guys - does anyone know how to make the READ piece of the graph in this example THINNER than the UNREAD piece of the graph?
[12:20:42] <synesp> http://jsfiddle.net/hSmVH/
[12:20:43] <ngl> that worked so nicely. Thanks again.
[12:20:47] <BillCriswell> 8,497 songs in iTunes and I'm not in the mood to listen to any of it.
[12:21:47] <duch_kazatel> synesp use fiddle right to start: http://jsfiddle.net/hSmVH/
[12:22:02] <Quirker> anyone know why when i do  $(document).click(function() {  my function works but when i do $('#element').click(function() {  my function doesnt work?
[12:22:04] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Listen to the sound of a 56k modem connecting to the internet in a loop
[12:22:17] <duch_kazatel> Quirker does #element get added after pageload?
[12:22:23] <BillCriswell> systemfault: I wonder how much of that I can stand.
[12:23:01] <Quirker> duch_kazatel: it gets added in my document ready
[12:23:09] <BillCriswell> systemfault: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHW1ho8L7V8
[12:23:12] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see the code then, Quirker
[12:23:15] <BillCriswell> Let's see how far I get.
[12:23:25] <synesp> @duch_kazatel what do you  mean?
[12:23:33] <synesp> use it right?
[12:23:46] <synesp> I didn't write that, it was something I found? I'm just using it as an example
[12:23:53] <duch_kazatel> synesp i fixed the script includes for you.  you have jquery in there twice, flot twice, and weren't using the script includes correctly.
[12:24:01] <duch_kazatel> i'm looking at the docs now.
[12:24:02] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Someone needs to create a 24 hours version :/
[12:24:13] <synesp> oh ok
[12:24:24] <synesp> do you have any idea how (if possible) to make that part thinner?
[12:24:33] <duch_kazatel> i just told you i'm looking at the docs now.
[12:24:44] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: CHOP CHOP
[12:24:46] <nisseni> how can I detect if a key is clicked without using a target?
[12:25:10] <BillCriswell> systemfault: This was fun for a few seconds.
[12:25:13] <synesp> duch_kazatel: yeah I went thru them without any luck.. wondering if we have a flot expert in here haha
[12:25:13] <duch_kazatel> seriously
[12:25:23] <BillCriswell> well...2:14 seconds
[12:25:30] <xelra> Well, this parallax business is the shizzz. Really. Now that I have everything moving like I want it to, I see that it doesn't work on mobile. On mobile it only moves the background like 5 seconds after I scroll. Performance is non-existant.
[12:25:43] <BillCriswell> systemfault: http://superuser.com/questions/477358/why-did-dialup-modems-make-noise this is interesting, however.
[12:26:50] <systemfault> BillCriswell: true
[12:27:17] <nisseni> never mind
[12:27:32] <martixy> Ahoy. Is there a method for getting the next element irrespective of level or do I have to walk the tree manually?
[12:27:52] <decx> get all element
[12:27:54] <decx> s
[12:28:06] <decx> like all of a certain class
[12:28:17] <duch_kazatel> synesp yeah, you'll have to start reading docs and messing with canvas.  i know nothing about flot OR canvas but somebody else may.
[12:28:44] <decx> well i know how to draw an arc
[12:28:48] <decx> but nothing about flot
[12:28:50] <decx> ;)
[12:29:15] <BillCriswell> martixy: Are they in a collection, or do you have your own definition of "next"?
[12:29:52] <martixy> What I meant by next is the next element matching a certain selector.
[12:30:24] <BillCriswell> martixy: I *think* you'd want $el.nextAll('.foo')[0]
[12:30:38] <BillCriswell> Er, .eq(0) for a jQuery object.
[12:30:40] <martixy> Cuz otherwise it will have to be - get parent, check for siblings, if not get parent's parent then check that for siblings, etc, etc.
[12:31:49] <martixy> And nextAll does not do that.
[12:32:02] <BillCriswell> martixy: I'd need to see the structure.
[12:32:28] <fuse405> can someone have a look at http://scsys.co.uk:8002/409233
[12:32:39] <martixy> It's a tree?
[12:33:16] <BillCriswell> martixy: http://jsbin.com/vesefopo/1/edit?html,js,output is what I was thinking you want.
[12:34:06] <martixy> No imagine all these are nested every which way. You reach a leaf. Get the element below it.
[12:34:40] <PantsOfChoco> isnt a leaf the end ofa  tree
[12:34:52] <drej> or the beginning of a new tree.
[12:35:18] <PantsOfChoco> not this philosophy shit again haha
[12:36:44] <BillCriswell> martixy: You can get the index of the elmenet in the collection with $collection.index($someEl)
[12:37:47] <BillCriswell> martixy: http://jsbin.com/vesefopo/2/edit?html,js
[12:39:33] <BillCriswell> martixy: That seem about right?
[12:39:42] <BillCriswell> What the hell is philosophy.
[12:40:27] <martixy> So if I'm going var foo = $("mahSelector").childred().first().next().whatever()...... can I do myNextElement = $("mahSelector").eq($(mahSelector).index(foo)); ?
[12:40:49] <decx> BillCriswell added a non canvas way http://jsfiddle.net/decx/37wRU/17/ still feels pretty good
[12:40:56] <martixy> er,,, index +1 :)
[12:41:12] <BillCriswell> martixy: I'd try it and see. Hard time following all that.
[12:41:40] <BillCriswell> decx: They both feel handsome.
[12:41:54] <BillCriswell> decx: Would it be easy to flip the world upside down?
[12:41:58] <martixy> Get the index like you suggested, then use .eq to navigate to index+1
[12:42:07] <BillCriswell> martixy: Yes.
[12:42:10] <decx> what like translate scale(1,-1)
[12:42:16] <decx> transform
[12:42:48] <martixy> Basically flatten the tree is what I'm doing.
[12:43:05] <decx> BillCriswell the onmousemove on the div was terrible until i did requestAnimationFrame(draw) instead of draw()
[12:43:12] <BillCriswell> martixy: That sounds right, but I don't know enough about trees to argue.
[12:43:35] <decx> drawcss*
[12:44:22] <decx> but i dont feel a difference, and all in one element, pretty handy
[12:44:30] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm still not sure I ever even used a canvas tag. =(
[12:44:47] <decx> the concept is the same, move images relative to their origin
[12:44:48] <BillCriswell> decx: It feels identical.
[12:48:40] <martixy> That works. Is this okay: next = $(".thing").eq($(".thing").index(current)+1); or should I do var thing = $(".thing"); ?
[12:50:57] <BillCriswell> I'd do var thing = $('.thing') since you're using it more than one.
[12:50:59] <BillCriswell> once*
[12:52:23] <thomasreggi> How do I get the width of an element as dictated by it's style in css? e.x. return 100% rather then computed value
[12:52:57] <decx> document.styleSheets something something
[12:53:50] <BillCriswell> something something bash head on wall
[12:53:57] <decx> or (widthinpx/windowwidth)*100+'%'
[12:54:47] <thomasreggi> decx: I don't always want percent
[12:54:49] <martixy> BillCriswell: That sounds about right :P
[12:55:01] <thomasreggi> martixy: is it that hard?
[12:55:22] <martixy> What?
[12:55:47] <martixy> I solved my problem. Just remarking on the general viablity of Bill's method :P
[12:56:02] <thomasreggi> BillCriswell: It it that hard to get uncomputed css values? That we have to bash head on wall? lol
[12:56:39] <martixy> Ah, it's probably not. Just have to research a bit.
[12:56:52] <martixy> Figuring the right API call is 50% of the work.
[12:56:53] <BillCriswell> thomasreggi: It just feels annoying. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7131462/getting-values-of-global-stylesheet-in-jquery the third answer down here is what the answer would look like.
[12:57:03] <BillCriswell> and definitely not cheap
[12:57:57] <thomasreggi> BillCriswell: It's for a web component I need what is entered into the parent so I can bring it into the shadow dom. I don't wanna convert it to percentage everytime :/
[12:59:38] <thomasreggi> I'm going to try to do it with pure css. =]
[12:59:57] <BillCriswell> I'm not too familiar with shadow dom or anything like that. What are you trying to do basically?
[13:00:14] <BillCriswell> I feel like whenever someone wants to do this there's usually another way around it.
[13:00:27] <thomasreggi> BillCriswell: select the given css value of a parent and apply it to the child
[13:00:41] <thomasreggi> BillCriswell: I'm trying other things
[13:01:02] <martixy> Is it not calculatable?
[13:01:12] <BillCriswell> Wouldn't width 100% on the child give it the width of the parent/
[13:01:19] <BillCriswell> I'm probably missing something
[13:01:43] <thomasreggi> BillCriswell: yeah in pixels
[13:02:08] <martixy> As in - if somewhere you have to put 50% width, shouldn't both it's normal size and it's view size be obtainable in some way?
[13:02:30] <thomasreggi> BillCriswell: I figured it out using auto
[13:02:43] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[13:02:49] <BillCriswell> That's the kind of stuff I like to hear haha
[13:03:31] <thomasreggi> BillCriswell: inherit* excuse me
[13:03:41] <thomasreggi> BillCriswell: CSS to the rescue!
[13:03:57] <BillCriswell> Sweeeet
[13:03:58] <martixy> <MyDreamWebpage contect="auto" style="auto"> </MyDreamWebpage>
[13:04:02] <martixy> content*
[13:04:33] <Mathis> hey
[13:06:02] <BillCriswell> Mathis: Ayyyyy
[13:06:22] <Mathis> got strange behaviour with .Sortable() on a table
[13:06:42] <BillCriswell> I don't trust tables.
[13:06:48] <Mathis> whenever I drag a row in a .Sortable() table, it drags the whole table, not just the row
[13:07:01] <Mathis> is that a known bug or feature?
[13:08:01] <BillCriswell> Mathis: So you're doing $('table').sortable()?
[13:08:08] <Mathis> yes
[13:08:48] <BillCriswell> Mathis: Maybe try $('tbody').sortable() ?
[13:09:41] <Quirker> Can someone edit this div to show me how I'm implementing .css background image improperly? http://jsfiddle.net/BrCMt/
[13:09:49] <Quirker> edit this fiddle*
[13:09:56] <Mathis> you mean $("tbody#mytable").sortable()?
[13:10:17] <duch_kazatel> Quirker look at your console
[13:10:42] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/BrCMt/1/ this should make it a little clearer.
[13:10:52] <BillCriswell> Mathis: No, $('tbody').sortable()
[13:11:44] <martixy> Maybe he has more than one table.
[13:11:53] <duch_kazatel> tbody#mytable won't help with that.
[13:12:05] <duch_kazatel> #mytable is probably a table element, not a tbody.
[13:12:16] <duch_kazatel> you could to '#mytable tbody'
[13:12:26] <Mathis> mytable is the ID of the <table> element
[13:12:34] <duch_kazatel> right, you want the tbody child of that element.
[13:12:46] <duch_kazatel> $('#mytable tbody') will get you that.
[13:13:22] <Quirker> duch_kazatel: i forgot to close it but it still doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/BrCMt/2/
[13:14:30] <duch_kazatel> Quirker not going to work in the fiddle if you don't include jquery...
[13:14:36] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/BrCMt/3/
[13:15:00] <Mathis> thanks, that was the required hint that I needed
[13:15:02] <Mathis> -
[13:15:04] <Mathis> :-)
[13:15:37] <Quirker> ah whopse weird that it works on jsfiddle and not my site hmm
[13:15:50] <duch_kazatel> Quirker do you have any console errors on your site?
[13:16:01] <duch_kazatel> does #collapse_zoom_menu get added after pageload?
[13:16:14] <Mathis> now it doesnt allow me to enter text into the input elements anymore inside each row... thats stupid...
[13:20:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:21:49] <Quirker> duch_kazatel: no but im pretty sure i know what causes the issue
[13:21:51] <Quirker> ('background-image',"url('../_content/panel1/background.png')");
[13:21:57] <Quirker> there is something wrong with the quotes
[13:22:03] <Quirker> how do i correct the quotes?
[13:22:18] <duch_kazatel> that's inconsistent but shouldn't cause problems.\
[13:22:33] <duch_kazatel> i'd put doubles around background-image instead.
[13:24:23] <Quirker> ('background-image','url("../_content/panel1/background.png")') this does the same thing
[13:24:34] <fonsA2> Hello. I'm using Sisyphus (http://sisyphus-js.herokuapp.com/) to remember my form values. I'm having an issue with it not remembering past a certain field when it's on my server. When I try it out on JFiddle everything is logged. On my server it doesnt remember anything past comments. JFiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/AA94D/3/
[13:24:37] <duch_kazatel> then you have another error somewhere.
[13:25:06] <Quirker> my log is empty
[13:25:21] <Quirker> also when i do background-color instead of background image it works
[13:25:22] <duch_kazatel> Quirker inspect the element.
[13:25:28] <duch_kazatel> is the path even valid?
[13:25:35] <fonsA2> Quirker?
[13:25:41] <fonsA2> What's that.
[13:26:44] <duch_kazatel> not directed at you.
[13:26:54] <Quirker> the path should be valid it works in my css
[13:27:25] <fonsA2> I know I'm using php print in some of the input values when submitted (form validates on the same page). I don't know if Sisyphus might be logging the php code?....
[13:29:18] <Quirker> duch_kazatel: if i do the actual http path instead of '../folder_path/' it works
[13:29:25] <Quirker> so its definitely something weird about those quotes
[13:29:28] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:29:33] <duch_kazatel> it's that the path is invalid.
[13:29:52] <Quirker> oh
[13:29:54] <duch_kazatel> it works on the fiddle.
[13:29:54] <Quirker> you're right
[13:30:12] <Quirker> i copied the path from my css folder
[13:30:17] <Quirker> so it shouldnt have the ..
[13:30:19] <Quirker> derp
[13:30:28] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[13:30:42] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 huh?  how would js "log" php?
[13:31:15] <fonsA2> Nevermind.
[13:31:31] <fonsA2> *goes to hide in a cave
[13:31:45] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:31:55] <duch_kazatel> shoulda just used what BillCriswell gave you earlier ;)
[13:33:21] <Ansikt> Yo DeltaHeavy
[13:33:34] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: Yo
[13:34:30] <Ansikt> I worked on a custom dropdown thing yesterday, but then my computer died and stuff.  I imagine this should work: http://jsfiddle.net/7BmVA/14/
[13:35:25] <Ansikt> Basically, the idea is, preventDefault the mousedown and open the dropdown, but allow the touchstart.
[13:35:31] <Ansikt> Actually, let me make a modification to that.
[13:35:54] <fonsA2> *Out of cave - So I go to look at the local storage log and it doesn't log past the comments textfield
[13:36:02] <fonsA2> when it's running on my server
[13:39:29] <Ansikt> DeltaHeavy, THIS one should work http://jsfiddle.net/7BmVA/16/
[13:40:29] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: Taking a bit to load. I opted for a custom mobile version that just has taller <li>s
[13:41:56] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: Awesome, thanks! I'll tuck this away somewhere
[13:42:35] <Ansikt> Cool beans.  My phone's on the fritz, so let me know if it actually works for touch.
[13:43:52] <DeltaHeavy> Can't view the jsfiddle on my phone and I'm busy right now. I'll try later.
[14:00:58] <blakespot> ,
[14:01:02] <duch_kazatel> .
[14:01:45] <fonsA2> Ah ha! Figured it out. I had an extra closing div which stopped the script from working
[14:01:51] <fonsA2> ....like anyone cares
[14:04:42] <BillCriswell> fonsA2: I am very relieved you got it working.
[14:05:26] <fonsA2> Nice. Relieved huh. haha
[14:05:30] <blakespot> Ok I am using SetInterval on a function that rotates these 3 images on this homepage -- http://parentalcontrols.qa.cble.co
[14:05:50] <blakespot> I need to script those arrows so the user can "take over" if they want. Would I re-declare SetInterval on click?
[14:06:05] <blakespot> or is SetInterval too odd a way to go if the arrows need to fire also
[14:06:07] <blakespot> ?
[14:06:37] <BillCriswell> blakespot: Are you doing this for educational purposes?
[14:06:52] <blakespot> How do you mean?
[14:07:10] <Ansikt> SetInterval is fine. I would store the id so you can clearinterval on click.
[14:07:35] <BillCriswell> blakespot: There's many slideshow carousel scripts out there already that have these types of features already.
[14:07:35] <blakespot> store the id of what?
[14:07:38] <blakespot> tnx
[14:07:59] <BillCriswell> blakespot: var timer = setInterval(...); then timer would be the id.
[14:08:11] <BillCriswell> You can stop the interval by doing clearInterval(timer);
[14:08:34] <blakespot> BillCriswell: This is a simple 3-div switcher and it seemed better to write a little script than install some slideshow system with a larger scope
[14:08:44] <Ansikt> Exactly.  Clear, then reinstantiate.
[14:08:50] <blakespot> thanks re: cleainterval Bill, Ansikt
[14:11:01] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[14:12:37] <decx> ugh, interval
[14:14:53] <Ansikt> decx: personally, I prefer while(1)
[14:28:13] <grrrat> How can I remove jquery's added attributes from dom elements in ie8?
[14:28:26] <Ansikt> grrrat, Why?
[14:28:29] <synesp> anyone here nasty with flot?
[14:28:41] <Ansikt> synapt, what does that even mean?
[14:28:47] <synesp> I'm synesp
[14:28:48] <grrrat> Ansikt: because i end up with a set of elements having the same jquery attributes
[14:29:00] <grrrat> and it makes events to one get triggered for the rest as well
[14:29:20] <decx> synesp just draw the damn arc by yourself
[14:29:38] <grrrat> for some readon these jquery properties are only added in ie8
[14:29:55] <grrrat> Ansikt: do you know how to do it?
[14:30:08] <Ansikt> Wait - do you mean the jQuery1231231231332 attribute on the dom node?
[14:30:16] <grrrat> yes
[14:30:59] <Ansikt> I don't think that should cause issues.  Can i see your event code?
[14:31:13] <grrrat> from what i read
[14:31:21] <grrrat> it caches the elements associated with that id
[14:31:28] <grrrat> so if there are multiple with the same one
[14:31:38] <grrrat> the handlers both all with be triggered
[14:31:38] <synesp> decx how do I do that
[14:31:46] <synesp> alongside flot
[14:32:16] <grrrat> so it seems kinda obvious that this would cause the problem Ansikt
[14:32:31] <shoky> grrrat that's not true at all. and that property is added in any browser, not just ie8
[14:32:48] <grrrat> i dont see these properties in firefox and ie9+
[14:32:59] <grrrat> at least i dont see them as attributes on the element
[14:33:12] <shoky> they are there on elements on which you've added event handlers, or jquery data
[14:33:16] <shoky> they are not attributes
[14:33:19] <shoky> they're properties
[14:33:30] <grrrat> in ie8 they are attributes as well
[14:33:50] <shoky> not supposed to be, if they are then you've got something weird going on
[14:33:51] <Ansikt> grrrat, No, those only exist for sizzle selection.  I suspect the problem is that your jQuery collections which you're adding event handlers to are selecting too many nodes.
[14:34:12] <grrrat> heres what i do:
[14:34:12] <shoky> not for sizzle, it's for events and data
[14:34:16] <grrrat> i create an element
[14:34:21] <grrrat> add some handlers to it
[14:34:28] <grrrat> then this element gets copied
[14:34:37] <Ansikt> How do you copy the element?
[14:34:47] <grrrat> its done by another library
[14:34:56] <grrrat> its to display a list of elements dynamically
[14:35:32] <decx> synesp i mean without a lib http://jsfiddle.net/decx/ESt2f/
[14:36:11] <grrrat> for some reason it works fine in chrome, firefox and ie9+
[14:36:24] <grrrat> and the only difference i see upon inspecting is that ie8 has these jquery attributes
[14:37:30] <grrrat> jQuery111106373225566782157="282" is an example of what im seeing in ie8
[14:38:22] <grrrat> any ideas?
[14:38:29] <shoky> not enough info
[14:38:34] <shoky> "its done by another library"
[14:38:39] <shoky> no code
[14:39:14] <shoky> make a jsfiddle ;p
[14:39:37] <arschmitz> grrrat: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9675922/jquery-is-adding-its-own-session-attribute-in-ie8-anchor-tags
[14:40:02] <w00tb3ast> hey all
[14:40:03] <arschmitz> grrrat: better http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9675922/jquery-is-adding-its-own-session-attribute-in-ie8-anchor-tags
[14:40:26] <grrrat> arschmitz: same link
[14:40:35] <arschmitz> sorry http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2760714/jquery-attribute-auto-added-to-elements
[14:40:42] <grrrat> but it doesnt answer my question
[14:40:47] <grrrat> it just says that 'it happens' lol
[14:41:14] <arschmitz> grrrat: it has to do with how your elements are being copied
[14:41:20] <arschmitz> they are copying the event handlers also
[14:41:31] <grrrat> hmm
[14:41:41] <arschmitz> but you dont know how they are being copied
[14:41:45] <arschmitz> so its hard to help
[14:42:11] <shoky> grrrat just use event delegation instead
[14:42:29] <grrrat> i cant
[14:42:30] <shoky> then you don't need to copy any event handlers, you just have one event handler on an ancestor element
[14:42:44] <arschmitz> grrrat: you can also just remove them like any other attribute
[14:42:58] <arschmitz> and the handler will be removed as the attribute is how it is tracked
[14:43:00] <grrrat> i cant easily remove them cause they haave random names
[14:43:10] <Ansikt> grrrat, use jQuery.cleanData();
[14:43:20] <w00tb3ast> I am trying to do something like string.indexOf(variable) to determine if something exists, but I've had to add functionality and now I can't test against that anymore I need to do something more like string.indexOf('text_' + some random character that I can't determine + variable); but I am not sure how to do that, I dont really care what comes after the underscore but before the variable there will always be an ='s sign
[14:43:36] <arschmitz> Ansikt: good idea that will scrub them of any data
[14:43:41] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast you want a regular expression.
[14:43:41] <arschmitz> from jquery
[14:43:50] <w00tb3ast> duch_kazatel how do I do that
[14:44:10] <grrrat> Ansikt: is it the same as removeData() ? cause i cant find cleanData in the docs
[14:45:15] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast depends
[14:45:33] <Ansikt> No.  It's an undocumented event.  It's a garbage collection method which unbinds object references from jquery
[14:45:37] <Ansikt> * undocumented method
[14:45:38] <arschmitz> grrrat: not quite its an internal undocumented method
[14:45:56] <grrrat> how do i use it?
[14:45:57] <arschmitz> removeData only removes things added with data()
[14:46:05] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast if you're just looking for indexOf('text_'), why not do that?
[14:46:11] <duch_kazatel> maybe a jsfiddle would be helpful.
[14:46:16] <grrrat> $.cleanData()?
[14:46:24] <w00tb3ast> duch_kazatel ok I will set one up
[14:46:30] <arschmitz> grrrat: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7083884/what-is-the-purpose-of-jquery-clean-and-cleandata-methods
[14:47:08] <grrrat> arschmitz: that doesnt really say anything more about cleanData
[14:47:25] <grrrat> does it remove all handlers from all elements? does it take parameters?
[14:47:27] * synapt is beginning to wonder who is getting bugged by the tab-nick mistakes more, himself or synesp since it always seems to be him in all the same channels :P
[14:47:40] <arschmitz> it fress associated data
[14:48:29] <grrrat> element.cleanData() ?
[14:48:34] <grrrat> how do i use it?
[14:49:49] <arschmitz> $.cleanData( element )
[14:50:08] <shoky> $.cleanData( [element] )
[14:50:13] <shoky> has to be an array
[14:50:19] <arschmitz> oh right
[14:50:42] <grrrat> the problem with this is that then i will have no event handlers at all
[14:50:43] <arschmitz> i forget almost never ever use it
[14:50:57] <arschmitz> dont clean the one you want?
[14:51:26] <grrrat> I want them all to have event handlers
[14:51:35] <grrrat> but i dont want all of them to be triggered at the same time
[14:51:51] <duch_kazatel> wut
[14:52:03] <arschmitz> wait what exactly is happening?
[14:52:06] <grrrat> right now if i click on one element the event handler for all of the elements get triggered
[14:52:13] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[14:52:14] <arschmitz> like you click one and it alerts 100X
[14:52:17] <grrrat> yes
[14:52:20] <duch_kazatel> have you shared your code at all?
[14:52:30] <arschmitz> yeah we need code here
[14:52:40] <grrrat> i can post the part that matters 1 sec
[14:53:20] <Ansikt> Yeah, really.  Is the lib code a jquery plugin>
[14:54:03] <grrrat> http://lpaste.net/107986
[14:54:07] <grrrat> this is the code basically
[14:54:14] <grrrat> the copying is done afterwards
[14:54:30] <grrrat> its done by angularjs's ng-repeat
[14:54:37] <duch_kazatel> this isn't helpful at all.  are you able to set up a functioning example?
[14:54:59] <grrrat> not really
[14:55:04] <w00tb3ast> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/79J4u/
[14:55:15] <grrrat> cant even get jsfiddle et al woking on ie8
[14:55:42] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/aS8bY/ Could someone help me figure out how to modify this jquery so that depending on how many items are selected it will add the info to the url instead of changing it?
[14:56:03] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast huh?
[14:56:09] <duch_kazatel> what does this have to do with your question?
[14:56:23] <phelix> if that makes sense.. if you select more than one the url should be /car/add/p145 for a single and if added an additional it would be /cart/add/p145-p147 etc.
[14:56:27] <duch_kazatel> phelix btw don't use .attr('value'), use .val()
[14:56:34] <duch_kazatel> and don't use .attr() in general, use .prop()
[14:56:53] <w00tb3ast> duch_kazatel so basically you can see that I have a string that I am trying to add to and currently the detection is by name because previously everything was a recent but now there are favourites and one favourite can have the same 'name' as previous items in a string if you look at line 8 thats where I was using it
[14:57:07] <phelix>  ok
[14:57:26] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast huh?
[14:57:27] <synesp> decx thanks
[14:57:55] <PantsOfChoco> ugh im sleepy
[14:58:03] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast back up - if(source.indexOf(name) == -1){ <- what isn't this doing that it needs to?
[14:58:29] <Ansikt> grrrat, Angular has an eventing system.  Why use jQuery's?
[14:58:52] <w00tb3ast> determining if fav_2=burke or if recent_2=burke
[14:58:53] <grrrat> angular uses jquery for events
[14:59:03] <grrrat> see im not actually registering jquery events
[14:59:20] <grrrat> im using ng-mouseenter attribute to have angular register the event
[14:59:22] <w00tb3ast> i need to know if the combination of fav_ and the name exists before adding it to the string
[14:59:29] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast okay, so you want to enumerate through source and see which key === "Burke"?
[14:59:44] <w00tb3ast> yeah
[14:59:47] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Could you help me figure out how to add jsut that item to the url and then remove it if they deselect an item? not sure what route to go about doing this.
[14:59:58] <duch_kazatel> phelix maybve in a sec.
[15:00:03] <phelix> sure
[15:00:43] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast what's with the count?
[15:01:20] <w00tb3ast> I mean i have an add_recent(name) function that will add it as a recent to the same string so I will already know that the key will either fav_ or recent_. The count is just so that I can keep track of them because I will only have 3 recents and then start overwriting them
[15:01:38] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast you're going about this in a really strange way and not making much sense.
[15:01:52] <w00tb3ast> hang on let me update the fiddle
[15:02:47] <w00tb3ast> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/79J4u/1/
[15:03:49] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast okay, so in add_recent you need to know if 'recent_' + number + 'name' exists?
[15:03:55] <duch_kazatel> does the number part of that matter?
[15:03:57] <w00tb3ast> yes
[15:04:07] <duch_kazatel> like do you need to know which number, or only that it exists?
[15:04:08] <w00tb3ast> number part is not in important
[15:04:21] <duch_kazatel> easy.
[15:04:30] <w00tb3ast> not for me :P
[15:04:44] <duch_kazatel> you just want a regular expression.
[15:04:45] <duch_kazatel> 1 sec.
[15:04:54] <w00tb3ast> probably explains why I suck at phrasing my question haha
[15:15:12] <w00tb3ast> duch_kazatel any updates?
[15:15:31] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast sorry, at work ;)
[15:15:36] <duch_kazatel> it'll be something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/79J4u/2/
[15:15:49] <duch_kazatel> but your strategy is kind of a bad idea overall imo.
[15:16:50] <w00tb3ast> that's ok it will be revised a little but i guess the most important part is whether or not I can match that string
[15:17:00] <duch_kazatel> why are you basing it off that string?
[15:17:05] <duch_kazatel> can you change how you're doing that part?
[15:17:18] <w00tb3ast> not really, it's how I am being provided the data
[15:17:28] <duch_kazatel> okay, you can still do it smarter :)
[15:18:15] <nick1> $('#checkbox').click(function(){
[15:18:15] <nick1>     if (this.checked) {
[15:18:15] <nick1> In this case, what does this inherit? is it the same as if (('#checkbox').checked) {
[15:18:41] <w00tb3ast> duch_kazatel yeah probably, so quick question: \\d+ in your RegExp means? and what does 'g' mean?
[15:18:42] <duch_kazatel> this is the clicked checkbox
[15:18:51] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast go read on mdn :)
[15:19:03] <duch_kazatel> \\d+ is a number, 'g' is "global"
[15:19:13] <w00tb3ast> haha roger that! Thanks for all the help :D
[15:19:21] <duch_kazatel> but this is a really fragile approach.
[15:20:02] <w00tb3ast> The data's structure is always going to be consistent and the source will be consistent too so I don't think I have too much to worry about
[15:20:10] <duch_kazatel> you do, actually.
[15:20:16] <duch_kazatel> because this is the hard way to do it.
[15:20:22] <w00tb3ast> orly? what's the easy way?
[15:20:57] <nick1> thanks
[15:21:05] * w00tb3ast is a designer and ux developer not really familiar with data manipulation
[15:21:53] <duch_kazatel> use that string to build out an object whose properties are named for "recent"
[15:21:59] <duch_kazatel> * or "favorite" or wahtever.
[15:22:08] <duch_kazatel> and make them arrays to hold values.
[15:22:31] <duch_kazatel> also smack the person who decided to give you that string.
[15:22:42] <w00tb3ast> haha I wish i could but they are in #murica
[15:23:03] <w00tb3ast> will \\d\d deal with 2 digits?
[15:23:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:23:25] <duch_kazatel> try my version with 2 digits...
[15:24:36] <w00tb3ast> right
[15:24:38] <w00tb3ast> i see
[15:25:28] <duch_kazatel> and check out mdn
[15:25:35] <w00tb3ast> yeah having a look now
[15:28:21] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I'm still here if your able to help me out that would be awesome :)
[15:32:55] <the8thbit|work> When using $(input).focus() is there any way to make it focus at the END of the input box?
[15:34:14] <duch_kazatel> phelix sorry - what's up?
[15:34:21] <the8thbit|work> Nevermind, I didn't figure out how to do it, but I found a workaround that happens to work in my particular situation
[15:35:29] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/aS8bY/
[15:35:47] <phelix> I have jquery set to edit the href tag of that link at the bottom
[15:36:35] <phelix> if i click one item it works fine. But adding an additional one or unchecking one needs to remove it.. so a single item should be /cart/add/p124 and if you add another item it needs to change it to /cart/add/p124-p145 or remove one of those items if unchecked.
[15:36:47] <phelix> if that makes any sense. Not sure how to go about doing that with jquery
[15:37:33] <duch_kazatel> you're doing it the hard way.
[15:37:47] <duch_kazatel> :)
[15:37:49] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[15:37:52] <phelix> I fugred as much. When it comesto jquery I always do lol
[15:38:02] <duch_kazatel> it's actually a javascript thing.
[15:38:08] <duch_kazatel> sorta.  i'll cook up a quick example.
[15:42:38] <duch_kazatel> what browsers do you need to support?
[15:43:00] <duch_kazatel> is IE8 important?  or not?

[15:45:15] <Hrumph> the code's not doing anything at the moment
[15:47:20] <phelix> duch_kazatel: ie8 doesn't matter
[15:47:22] <phelix> just 11 and higher for ie
[15:47:30] <duch_kazatel> lol 11 is the latest version.
[15:47:36] <phelix> yea
[15:47:45] <phelix> not sure what I was thinking
[15:47:49] <phelix> actually 10 and up is what I meant
[15:47:54] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.

[15:51:04] <hExDJ> what can I do?
[15:51:21] <duch_kazatel> hExDJ search google for how to do that.  pretty easy.

[15:52:17] <duch_kazatel> that was a google search btw
[15:52:44] <hExDJ> if you would've said what the terminology was, I could have done it too

[15:53:41] <jumanji> hi guys im trying to generate an xpath for similar elements on a page. any insights? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24922357/javascript-a-single-xpath-or-css-path-expression-for-similar-elements
[15:53:45] <duch_kazatel> also doesn't handle the case where there's nothing.
[15:54:11] <duch_kazatel> Hrumph so what do you want?
[15:54:22] <Hrumph> duch_kazatel: wait a moment...i might have uncovered a problem
[15:54:39] <duch_kazatel> because your code isn't valid javascript.
[15:55:12] <Hrumph> duch_kazatel: yes i pasted the wrong thing...there is some meta code from haskell.. i am going to paste the translated code in one minute if i can't fix it now
[15:55:20] <duch_kazatel> cool
[15:56:07] <duch_kazatel> jumanji why are you tryig to generate those?
[15:56:18] <jumanji> duch_kazatel: for web testing
[15:56:34] <jumanji> duch_kazatel: say there's a whole bunch of links in a search result, i want to visit each of those
[15:57:08] <duch_kazatel> ah
[15:57:10] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[15:58:09] <jumanji> I did create an implementation where it just compares two xpaths, and tries to generate an xpath that will catch all similar elements
[15:58:14] <jumanji> but it's not very robust
[15:58:19] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I just noticed your post let me check that otu
[15:58:25] <jumanji> so im trying to see if there's a different approach to this problem
[15:58:57] <duch_kazatel> jumanji i mean, there's always css.
[15:58:58] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Perfect!! thank youso much
[15:59:05] <duch_kazatel> phelix that's not perfect btw.
[15:59:13] <duch_kazatel> if you deselect everything it'll break.
[15:59:14] <jumanji> duch_kazatel: i'm open to css path too but wonder what advantages it offers over xpath
[15:59:28] <duch_kazatel> are you familiar with css?
[15:59:33] <phelix> duch_kazatel: k
[15:59:55] <duch_kazatel> jumanji a sample of html you're working with might be helpful if you can supply it.
[16:00:38] <Hrumph> duch_kazatel: ok here is a revision (i still cant get it to work): http://pastebin.com/pD035jBm
[16:00:55] <duch_kazatel> #{toJSON ("inner_data_table_toggle_box") - this isn't valid.
[16:01:07] <phelix> any idea why I would be getting TypeError $this.prop is not a function?
[16:01:08] <duch_kazatel> what's the actual, rendered selector?
[16:01:08] <Hrumph> duch_kazatel: i fixed it
[16:01:16] <phelix> is it because of wrong jquery version on my site by chance?
[16:01:24] <Hrumph> oh crap  one second
[16:02:02] <duch_kazatel> phelix dunno.
[16:02:20] <duch_kazatel> phelix what version of jquery are you running?

[16:12:08] <freshman123> and i want to add this {"name": "Son", "parent": "Root", "children": [] } inside "children" property
[16:12:28] <freshman123> i tried treeData[0].children.push ({"name": "Son", "parent": "Root", "children": [] }); but don't work

[16:19:06] <xp_prg> hi all, I am using a jquery ui slider and I want to set the position of the slider to be other than 1 - 100 but I can't seem to figure out how to do that, anyone know?
[16:23:55] <in_deep_thought> what is the best url to use if I want to use jquery in my html? <script src=“?????”></script> I want to point to it somewhere on the internet, not deal with dwnlding it myself
[16:26:32] <in_deep_thought> <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script>
[16:26:35] <in_deep_thought> I guess thats it
[16:33:40] <Hrumph> ok can anyone look at http://pastebin.com/qsEjsgRM and tell me what i'm doing wrong?
[16:34:29] <Hrumph> duch_kazatel: i put in the raw javascript
[17:18:15] <guideX> say I have '<label class="isAdmin cb-enable selected"><span>option1</span></label><label class="isAdmin cb-disable"><span>option2</span></label>' how do I know which one has the selected class?
[17:18:25] <shoky> Hrumph: lines 3 and 4 should be swapped.  or you could just do $('input[name="checkbox_items"]').prop('checked', this.checked);
[17:18:35] <guideX> somehow var isAdmins = $(".isAdmin");var isAdminEnabled = $(isAdmins).find(".cb-enable");var isAdminDisabled = $(isAdmins).find(".cb-disable"); isn't telling me
[17:18:51] <guideX> along with console.log($(isAdminEnabled).hasClass("selected"));
[17:19:34] <Hrumph> shoky: thanks
[17:19:45] <shoky> guideX: you want .filter() not .find()
[17:19:49] <guideX> oh
[17:19:52] <guideX> ok thanks
[17:20:21] <guideX> ahh, now it's workign
[17:20:27] <shoky> also just do isAdmins.filter(..)  no need to call jquery again
[17:20:52] <guideX> is there a one liner to do this?
[17:20:57] <guideX> instead of like 3 lines
[17:21:08] <vegancow> when I load a document from jquery my input (radio buttons) dissapears?
[17:21:12] <shoky> to do what.. ? you're defining 3 new variables
[17:21:27] <guideX> well I really just want a 1 or 0 in the end, 0 being disabled, 1 being enabled
[17:21:36] <guideX> all these variables aren't really needed
[17:21:48] <shoky> 0 or 1? based on what
[17:22:15] <guideX> well there's two isAdmin labels, one is "cb-enable", one is "cb-disable"
[17:22:23] <guideX> I want a 0 for disabled, 1 for enabled
[17:22:27] <guideX> kind of like a checkbox
[17:23:13] <shoky> i dont understand the 0/1 ... what does it mean ;p  how would you do what you want in multiple lines?
[17:23:21] <guideX> oh sorry, based on which one has the "selected" class
[17:23:33] <guideX> so only one at a time will have the class "selected"
[17:24:00] <shoky> why do you need 0 or 1
[17:24:07] <guideX> could be true/false
[17:24:11] <guideX> doesn't matter I guess
[17:24:27] <guideX> just assumed numbers would be best, doesn't matter though
[17:25:17] <shoky> well if you know one of them always has the selected class..  var enabledIsSelected = $('.isAdmin.cb-enable.selected').length > 0;
[17:25:33] <shoky> gives you a true/false
[17:25:36] <guideX> ah ok cool thanks, didn't think of that
[17:26:02] <shoky> same as $('.isAdmin.cb-enable').hasClass('selected') really
[17:27:11] <shoky> oh didn't notice you said this before    <guideX> along with console.log($(isAdminEnabled).hasClass("selected"));
[17:31:54] <Keavon> I'm trying to use get, ajax, and load to load text from a text file, but every time I keep getting the error "junk after document element" because the text file isn't XML
[17:32:43] <guideX> what do you think? if ($(".isAdmin").filter(".cb-enable").hasClass("selected") == true && $(".isAdmin").filter(".cb-disable").hasClass("selected") == false) { ...  } else if ($(".isAdmin").filter(".cb-enable").hasClass("selected") == true && $(".isAdmin").filter(".cb-disable").hasClass("selected") == true) {
[17:32:56] <guideX> seems to be the shortest and best
[17:33:20] <guideX> I guess what confused me before is, the enabled one always has the selected class for some reason

[18:14:57] <duch_kazatel> derp!
[18:15:16] <luvmyh0nda> Hi, I have a page with buttons (shopping cart add/remove items). If a user clicks a second button prior to the previous ajax call completing, it aborts the previous call. How do I circumvent this?
[18:19:15] <Jattenalle> luvmyh0nda, instead of calling the functions directly, wrap them in a function(){} in the event, each having its own ajax... OR disable the buttons until the call is completed or times out
[18:46:40] <sammych> is there a cheat sheet for jQuery Mobile, or maybe a jqapi.com -like page for jQM?
[19:56:09] <Hrumph> hi
[19:56:17] <Hrumph> what does the selector  $(':input', form) mean?
[19:56:33] <Hrumph> (please help me to suck less than i already do)
[19:57:04] <Hrumph> specfically what is the :input selector all about?
[19:57:24] <systemfault> It a jQuery-ism, it means all form controls
[19:57:34] <systemfault> (By jQuery-ism, it means that it’s not part of CSS)
[19:58:08] <systemfault> It’s a selector you should not use.
[19:58:25] <Hrumph> ok can you suggest an equivalent selector (i copied and pasted that one)
[19:59:38] <systemfault> Hrumph: What do you want to select?
[19:59:42] <systemfault> And why.
[19:59:48] <Hrumph> systemfault: i'm thinking about it....
[20:00:12] <Hrumph> i'll probably have a an id set for the form
[20:00:40] <Hrumph> so i'll probably really want to do $("my_id").click(etc....)
[20:01:03] <systemfault> $('#my_id').on('click', …. ?
[20:01:14] <systemfault> What type of element is #my_id?
[20:01:25] <Hrumph> form element
[20:02:35] <Hrumph> but i'd like to generalise it so i have a function i can keep reusing
[20:02:38] <Hrumph> like the clearform function
[20:03:27] <Hrumph> hmm i think i see a way forward
[20:03:54] <Hrumph> i see that click allows for a generic object to be passed
[20:04:05] <Hrumph> sorry i am new to both jquery and javascript
[20:04:11] <Hrumph> javascript rubs me the wrong way
[20:04:52] <systemfault> The main problem I can see if that you don't want to explain what you want to do and you're not giving us a test case. (http://jsfiddle.net)
[20:04:54] <Hrumph> i'm now used to the rigidity of haskell not this language where anything can be be used a millinon differen ways
[20:05:34] <systemfault> Hrumph: Be happy, I've been fighting with haskell for two weeks now and I still feel that I can't do anything with it.
[20:05:36] <Hrumph> systemfault: the idea is to creat a cuntion that will clear a form on a click even but the form should be specified as an argument to the function i think so its general
[20:05:58] <Hrumph> anyway yes i don't know what i'm talking about at the moment
[20:06:04] <Hrumph> perhaps things will become clearer to me later on
[20:06:10] <systemfault> Hrumph: The "form" element has a .reset() function AFAIK
[20:06:20] <Hrumph> systemfault: that just resets to the defaults
[20:06:33] <Hrumph> a clear function will clear the form somehow
[20:06:41] <Hrumph> and there is no standard clear function
[20:07:07] <systemfault> Hrumph: How do you reset a set of radio buttons?
[20:07:51] <Hrumph> systemfault typically you have the first one checked and not the others i think
[20:08:24] <Hrumph> often the first one will be the "null" or "no choice" button anyway
[20:08:53] <Hrumph> its an art not a science
[20:18:03] <Hrumph> sorry misread...the reset function should put the form elements to back to whatever they were when the page was loaded
[20:18:33] <Hrumph> i think but i haven't really confirmed that
[20:18:43] <Hrumph> but i don't want the reset function anyway
[20:21:52] <Hrumph> what is :input different from input?
[20:21:59] <Hrumph> why is i meant
[20:22:36] <Hrumph> shouldn't input (no colon) also select all input elements?
[20:24:34] <Hrumph> :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. input selects input element.
[20:24:36] <Hrumph> i see
[20:24:43] <Hrumph> interesting
[21:39:36] <iAmerikan> systemfault: https://gist.github.com/0b291f73f9436b0ec67e
[21:40:12] <iAmerikan> from what i can tell the error is coming from parseDiv
[21:41:02] <systemfault> iAmerikan: You have scoping issues, basically… in your parseMessages function, the this inside the .each isn't the same as the one outside of it
[21:41:41] <iAmerikan> how do i bind it?
[21:41:44] <iAmerikan> call apply or bind?
[21:41:55] <systemfault> iAmerikan: The usual way to fix it would be to add: var that = this; between line 21 and 22 and use that inside the .each
[21:42:10] <systemfault> iAmerikan: If your don't need to support shitty browsers, .bind is definitely what you want
[21:42:33] <systemfault> You'd replace line 25 with }.bind(this));
[21:43:32] <iAmerikan> would I bind with this
[21:43:34] <iAmerikan> or $this?
[21:43:48] <systemfault> Oh wait, I think I'm misleading you :/
[21:45:05] <systemfault> Yup, I was mixed up with your mix of .each and .forEach, sorry
[21:45:19] <systemfault> The weird lines are 3 and 4
[21:45:22] <iAmerikan> no problem, i've heard it's an issue
[21:45:41] <systemfault> What are those 2 lines supposed to do?
[21:46:02] <iAmerikan> get 2 different spans from the passed div
[21:46:15] <systemfault> iAmerikan: Then you want: var $nick = $div.find('b span');
[21:46:22] <systemfault> And var $msg = $div.find('span:last');
[21:46:26] <iAmerikan> lemme see
[21:49:33] <iAmerikan> I should have came here a long time ago :p
[21:49:38] <iAmerikan> thank you very much systemfault
[21:50:01] <systemfault> You're welcome, sorry for earlier…
[21:50:05] <iAmerikan> I thought I remembered that you can use $('...') from any of the $elements
[21:50:16] <iAmerikan> don't apologize, i've ran into issues with that as well
[21:50:22] <iAmerikan> in different projects
[21:50:32] <systemfault> iAmerikan: Yup, you could have done var $msg = $('span:last', $div); instead
[21:50:58] <systemfault> But I think .find is clearer
[21:51:16] <iAmerikan> I had a simple working function earlier, but now I can use this as a basis for other features :)
[23:22:40] <frank_o> So I can do like `var a, b, c;` instead of `var a; var b; var c;` -- but is there a similar way to shorten `globalVar.a = X; globalVar.b = Y; globalVar.c = Z;`?
[23:41:13] <shoky> frank_o: $.extend(globalVar, {a:X, b:Y, c:Z})
[23:42:20] <shoky> (doesn't matter if it's global or not)
[23:58:23] <Spami> Hello
[23:58:37] <Spami> Any idea why I can't access to dom here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7dfecd53f460c7f97808 ?
[23:59:21] <systemfault> Why can't you access it?
[23:59:31] <Spami> yeah
[23:59:39] <Spami> ah, in the debugger I mean
[23:59:40] <systemfault> How do you even know?
[23:59:44] <systemfault> Do you get an error
[23:59:48] <systemfault> Ahhh…
[23:59:56] <Spami> sorry, getting late :/
