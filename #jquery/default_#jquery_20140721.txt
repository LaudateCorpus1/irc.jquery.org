[00:02:29] <dddh> Catz`: hide link - event.preventDefault()?
[00:13:02] <aki_> oh. anonymous function.
[00:37:47] <dddh> aki_: (omg)
[00:39:20] <mdev> can I have hidden html data that I can have jquery read and manipulate its text?
[00:39:37] <mdev> I need to log chat related stuff and building the html on the fly via jquery esems like a pain
[00:40:31] <aki_> dddh: let's not talk about how many hours of my day that ate up.
[00:42:14] <dddh> ;(
[00:42:34] <Zak> how do I reject/resolve a deferred from another deferred object?
[00:42:42] <Zak> almost like passing the promise on
[00:42:48] <Zak> when?
[00:48:37] <Zak> e.g. someFunction().then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
[01:14:30] <Voyage> Can I use socket.io with java websocket api? and how would the "graceful degradation" take place in old browsers?
[01:45:06] <xenaxon> hi
[01:45:49] <xenaxon> i have a json array/object with a set of rows from the database
[01:46:06] <xenaxon> how can I add data from each one, to multiple html elements?
[01:46:18] <xenaxon> depending on the date period they cover
[01:46:31] <xenaxon> I need to somehow select a range
[01:47:07] <mdev> so I created a hidden div(using display:none) that has html I want to manipulate over and over and append to another div
[01:47:18] <mdev> is it best to load the html into memory and mess with it
[01:47:26] <mdev> or just mess with it on the page or something
[01:50:05] <aki_> okay I guess I'm rusty on jquery because I have another ajax question that feels really elementary.
[01:50:39] <aki_> I'm making a request that's returning a 302, which is fine, but I want all that in the data object, not my window redirecting
[01:50:48] <mdev> ahh screw it i'll just create the html in javascript and mess with it though
[01:53:38] <aki_> I could put it in an anonymous function and it'll work on everything in firefox, or I could put it on the window object and it'll follow the 302 request.     ...    ...
[01:56:09] <jessica_> Hi, can anyone convert this code to jquery?....it's throwing "ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined" when I'm using pure JS code

[02:46:02] <Vivekananda_y510> hi everyone
[03:27:41] <__itsme> Such quiet.  Many silense.  So nothing.  What's jkweery?  Wow!
[03:36:15] <Vivekananda_y510> trying to load a page inside a div. how to do that ?  http://jsfiddle.net/WufLj/1/
[03:42:29] <__itsme> Vivekananda_y510 You can only load things on the same domain (unless you use something in the middle on your own server) same domain policy for security reasons.
[03:43:28] <__itsme> I've fixed the code so it works as expected now.  Try it again and look in your browser console... http://jsfiddle.net/WufLj/3/
[03:43:39] <Vivekananda_y510> __itsme, gosh such a difficult name to type :). okay trying now
[03:44:42] <__itsme> lol - yours is much harder :p
[03:44:42] <Vivekananda_y510> __itsme, so if I want to load that content for the moment how do I do it ?
[03:44:57] <__itsme> Simplest answer is to use an iframe
[03:47:26] <__itsme> If you can write something to do it then you could make a "proxy" on your web server.  I could give you C# asp.net code for that, but there are publicly available options...
[03:47:28] <__itsme> https://developer.yahoo.com/javascript/howto-proxy.html
[03:47:49] <__itsme> I also saw a *very* simply php implementation today
[03:52:11] <Vivekananda_y510> __itsme, that site and its code is I guess open source. I am trying to download it so that it can get data and run it locally. I wonder how to do it . currently I used winhttptrac with the link http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/projects/armsglobe/   and it did download the site but am stuck at the index page and it doesnt load beyond that
[03:52:40] <Vivekananda_y510> even with a working internet connection it does not advance
[03:53:37] <__itsme> Are you seeing any errors in the console?
[03:54:48] <Vivekananda_y510> ummm
[03:54:59] <Vivekananda_y510> lemme try it out again
[03:57:21] <Vivekananda_y510> the other issue is I have apache drupal set up
[04:00:49] <__itsme> I'm not overly familiar with apache and have has next to nothing to do with drupal
[04:01:05] <__itsme> I can't help you out with issues with either of them
[04:02:02] <Vivekananda_y510> __itsme, even if I did not have drupal yet I would have to find a way to run this locally
[04:03:40] <__itsme> I still say an iframe is your best answer
[04:03:51] <__itsme> Literally 1 line of markup and it's there
[04:06:37] <Vivekananda_y510> __itsme, I know it would be an easy solution but it wont solve the issue in the long run. The idea in the long run is to run the site from local data on a local/self-maintained server
[04:06:56] <Vivekananda_y510> so as a first step I need to download the data
[04:07:15] <Vivekananda_y510> and run it so it runs locally even with no connection to internet
[04:07:17] <__itsme> Then you need to open the page and basically see how they do it.
[04:07:31] <Vivekananda_y510> yeah I guess so too
[04:07:36] <__itsme> There's no quick "copy this site" fix, I'm afraid
[04:08:45] <Vivekananda_y510> is painful and long so will be at it. I hope I would get help wherever I get stuck . A good channel for such help ?
[04:08:52] <Vivekananda_y510> apart from #web
[04:09:59] <__itsme> Not sure - I don't come here that often
[04:10:10] <__itsme> Here's a starting point though
[04:10:18] <__itsme> Data is mostly coming from here... http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/projects/armsglobe/categories/All.json
[04:10:49] <__itsme> and is loaded in this file... http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/projects/armsglobe/js/visualize.js
[04:10:58] <__itsme> There's a LOT more to it than that, but it's a start
[04:25:09] <Vivekananda_y510> __itsme, is there a way you can tell me how to figure it out
[04:25:22] <Vivekananda_y510> ie the steps to use to figure this out ?
[04:25:40] <Vivekananda_y510> I dont know using the dev tools very well and sometimes it convuses it quite a bit

[04:30:18] <mukesh> how to disble zoom effect in ipad and iphone
[04:30:22] <__itsme> It's quite a large thing that you're trying to do so I can't walk you through it, but keep the console open at all times.  It shows you what's going on in the page and where things are in the scripts (check the right hand side to see filename and line number, and click it to go directly there)
[04:30:43] <__itsme> It's going to be a "learn on the job" kind of thing, but I believe that's the best way to learn

[04:44:00] <__itsme> xenaxon look at jquery's filter() method
[04:46:54] <karamazov> I've got an event trigger that applies some css transformations on 'mouseover' but I only want to allow one even to trigger at a time. Currently, the animations queue and I can call it on multiple elements https://gist.github.com/anonymous/463bc8d1d3bc2f62cf98
[04:47:40] <karamazov> I figured I'd create a boolean to disable to mouseover event but it seems the animations resets it before actually completing. I've tried using an animationEnd but had no luck.
[04:48:02] <karamazov> I'm thinking the next step is just to timeout the mouseover event for the duration of the animation?
[04:55:08] <__itsme> karamazov can you put it in a jsfiddle so I can see it working?
[04:56:44] <karamazov> __itsme: I'll get a live version up :)
[04:57:01] <Fr4NgUs> Hello all
[04:57:18] <Fr4NgUs> i want to know how can i upload a file wth ie9
[04:57:42] <Fr4NgUs> because ajax form does not work
[04:59:07] <Fr4NgUs> http://pastebin.com/UtLk5pCs
[05:01:51] <karamazov> __itsme: http://104.131.253.137/browser_test/index.html
[05:02:37] <karamazov> You'll see that sporadic movement build up the animation - ideally, I'd like the mouseover to only trigger for a single image at a time.
[05:16:41] <__itsme> karamazov My guess is that the animation is queued and then you set active=false, but the animations haven't actually taken place.  Try putting the calls to rotation("left") and rotation("right") inside animate callbacks - $frame.animate({ stuff }, function() { rotate("right"); });
[05:17:47] <karamazov> __itsme: Yeah that's what I'm thinking the reasoning is too. I'll give that a shot!
[05:19:38] <__itsme> karamazov in the final one where you set it to 0deg it would be    $frame.animate({transform: 'rotate(0deg)'}, function() { active = false; });
[05:20:02] <karamazov> Good call
[05:20:20] <karamazov> __itsme: For it to work as a callback do I need to add the comma?
[05:20:53] <__itsme> karamazov yes - $frame.animate({ }, function() { ... });
[05:21:08] <karamazov> Cool - trying it now
[05:21:09] <__itsme> the anonymous function is passed as the 2nd parameter to animate
[05:22:52] <karamazov> __itsme: I stayed up all night working on this...and you've solved it. Thanks.
[05:44:42] <ericx2x> Is there a way I can get this menu I made to act like accordion? This is the menu: http://jsfiddle.net/erictheprogrammer/97uXp/
[05:44:54] <ericx2x> What I mean by accordion is this: http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[05:46:59] <__itsme> karamazov Great!  Glad I could help :)
[05:50:59] <ericx2x> Hm, I think I answered my own question lol
[05:52:14] <ericx2x> I sort of got it working: http://jsfiddle.net/erictheprogrammer/97uXp/1/
[05:52:26] <ericx2x> however how do I also make the inner ul use accordion
[05:52:43] <ericx2x> like cultural should open up when you click on it...
[05:56:44] <ericx2x> Anyone know how I can get multi level accordion menu going?
[05:56:58] <ericx2x> I'm not even sure if the accordion function allows it by default
[05:57:53] <mdev> when I do
[05:58:02] <mdev> $whatever.hide(); it adds display:none
[05:58:07] <mdev> but that does nothing without !important
[05:58:14] <mdev> any easy way to force the important?
[06:00:20] <mdev> .attr("style", "display: inline !important"); apparently does it
[06:01:48] <mdev> you guys slipping
[06:01:56] <mdev> usually ontop of the answers, now google beating you out
[06:05:04] <__itsme> mdev - something else is causing the problem as inline styles override all others.  You should *never* need !important for inline styles
[06:06:09] <__itsme> also, display:none and display:inline ???  Not sure what you're trying to do
[06:06:29] <mdev> .hide sets display:none that doesn't get it done, it needs display:none !important
[06:06:35] <mdev> which above does I just typed
[06:06:38] <mdev> typo'd
[06:08:03] <blakespo1> greetings
[06:09:21] <__itsme> mdev Like I said then, something else is causing the problem.  If you've got it working though, fine.
[06:10:19] <zerribert> newb question: can someone explain why this is happening: http://pastebin.com/Q4BLzvvi  thanks!
[06:10:33] <__itsme> I think you probably have display set in css somewhere, with !important used there.  That's the only way it could override inline
[06:12:39] <__itsme> zerribert - not without seeing the html
[06:21:34] <ericx2x> Can anyone get this so that when you click on cultural the parent menu doesn't collapse? http://jsfiddle.net/erictheprogrammer/97uXp/2/
[06:22:29] <ericx2x> This one is actually clearer sorry http://jsfiddle.net/erictheprogrammer/97uXp/3/
[06:25:06] <ericx2x> never mind i just got it
[06:32:57] <Fraz> hi
[06:38:13] <mdev> I got  <a id="button-trigger" class="button-trigger" href="#"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i></a>
[06:38:24] <mdev> trying to remove the chevron class with
[06:38:25] <mdev>  $('#button-trigger').nextAll('i').first().removeClass("fa-chevron-circle-right");
[06:38:31] <mdev> not working :/ any ideas?
[06:42:05] <__itsme> mdev Is there a reason for not doing it like this?  $("#button-trigger .fa-chevron-circle-right").removeClass("fa-chevron-circle-right");
[06:42:24] <__itsme> Also, is that meant to be in the button click event handler, or not?
[06:45:16] <mdev> yeah is an .on and i'll try that thank you
[06:45:33] <__itsme> mdev if it's in the button click handler then it's different
[06:46:05] <__itsme> $("#button-trigger").on("click", function() { $(this).find(".fa-chevron-circle-right").removeClass("fa-chevron-circle-right"); });
[06:47:29] <mdev> your previous example didn't work
[06:47:46] <mdev> caues the class isn't for that div id, it's in a <i> inside the div id
[06:48:14] <mdev> nevermind it worked
[06:48:17] <mdev> thanks
[06:50:23] <__itsme> mdev What you just said makes no sense.  The selector was looking inside #button-trigger, and in your example it's not a div
[06:51:10] <__itsme> the space between #button-trigger and .fa-chevron-circle-right makes it look *inside* #button-trigger, not see if it has that class.  It would be #button-trigger.fa-chevron-circle-right to do that (no space)
[06:51:52] <mdev> whoaa now, calm down
[06:51:56] <mdev> already said you right
[06:52:02] <mdev> thanks for the help!
[06:52:59] <drej> whats with all the yelling
[06:53:02] <drej> sheesh
[06:53:10] <__itsme> Lol - I am calm.  Just explaining because your comment didn't make sense :)
[06:53:57] <drej> stop yelling!
[06:53:58] <drej> ffs
[06:55:09] <pmurias> is it possible to override the encoding with $.ajax if I'm getting an incorrect one via a Content-Type from the server?
[06:55:27] <pmurias> it sends me utf-8 disguised as iso-8859-1
[06:55:41] <pmurias> I'm using jsonp as the request is for a different server
[07:40:13] <Jon47> does anybody know the intended purpose of the "context" parameter in a jquery call, e.g. like this form: http://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery-selector-context
[07:40:43] <Jon47> is there any reason to use it versus just ".find"?
[07:41:40] <Jon47> in other words, assuming "x" and "y" are jquery collections, how would I choose whether to use x.find(y) versus $(y, x)
[07:41:51] <__itsme> Jon47 it does do the exact same thing.  I'm not sure but .find() may have simply come later.  I only say that because performance tests show that .find() is considerably faster
[07:41:52] <blakespot> So, I've got this site I'm finishing off - launch soon.,..
[07:42:07] <blakespot> left nav is using jquery to slide in and out panes of items with hover
[07:42:11] <blakespot> http://parentalcontrols.qa.cble.co
[07:42:23] <Jon47> __itsme: ah interesting, thanks. it's also much easier to read, which I'm frankly more concerned about
[07:42:26] <blakespot> I need to make this also work on tablet / iPad with tap
[07:42:40] <blakespot> I see so much info about this and that approach
[07:42:47] <blakespot> Is there a good guide out there?
[07:43:05] <blakespot> Anyone able to take a look? (Portrait mode is the target, landscape needs spacing work yet done)
[07:43:33] <__itsme> Jon47 I totally agree.  I just feel a lot more comfortable with .find()
[07:44:01] <__itsme> blakespot Are you referring to click events?
[07:44:37] <blakespot> Yes. Right now the whole thing is handled via hover events
[07:44:49] <blakespot> I need it to work with those and also click for iPad
[07:45:15] <blakespot> http://parentalcontrols.qa.cble.co/wp-content/themes/parentalcontrols/js/app.js
[07:45:30] <blakespot> left nav code is blocked in comments
[07:45:40] <__itsme> blakespot have a read up on touchstart & tap events.  I believe they vary with different mobile OSs (surprise, surprise)
[07:45:55] <blakespot> Yes, joy
[07:46:00] <blakespot> iOS is the primary target
[07:46:47] <__itsme> I did do something.  I'll have a look - brb
[07:47:04] <blakespot> __itsme: Thank you much
[07:48:25] <__itsme> Found it.  This was an app for Android devices but you should be able to adapt it for iOS...
[07:48:35] <__itsme> var _clickEvent = (function() { 	return navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().search("android") == -1 ? "click" : "touchstart"; })();
[07:48:51] <__itsme> then use  $(element).on(_clickEvent, function() { ... });
[07:49:02] <__itsme> So it will work in both browsers and as an app
[07:49:14] <blakespot> "as an app" ?
[07:49:14] <__itsme> Not sure if that will help but that's the approach I took to work for both
[07:49:41] <blakespot> == web page on a mobile device ?
[07:49:52] <__itsme> Sorry - not relevant.  I was using Cordova at the time and building something that would work as a web page or within an app
[07:50:30] <blakespot> hmm
[07:50:39] <blakespot> interesting
[07:50:40] <__itsme> That will allow you to code click events though, and target different event names on different devices
[07:51:14] <__itsme> There may well be a perfect library out there, but I couldn't find anything and that was such a simple solution to my issue that I went with it
[07:51:40] <MikeD_> is there a way to pass an object method to a jquery event handler but still have a reference to the object's properties?
[07:52:14] <__itsme> MikeD_ is there a reason you can't simply pass the object?
[07:52:17] <blakespot> __itsme: thank you
[07:52:27] <__itsme> blakespot No problem - I hope it helps :)
[07:53:39] <MikeD_> idk
[07:54:20] <workerbeetwo> hey. simple question how to select by IDs that have a certina pattern? for instance "aktive_1,aktiv_2" => or "aktiv_\d" as regex
[07:55:38] <MikeD_> .on('keyup',function(evt){ objectref.method( evt.target ); } )  <-- like that?  does 'this' in the object method refer to the object or the event target?
[07:55:56] <m1su> workerbeetwo: $("div[id^='aktiv']")
[08:06:42] <workerbeetwo> m1su: nice.
[08:07:06] <workerbeetwo> m1su: but its not divs . its selects in this case.
[08:08:16] <marc_v92> workerbeetwo: So switch “div” to “select” ;)
[08:08:25] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[08:09:54] <decx> yeah but what about spans?
[08:13:21] <ericx2x> Can anyone get this to work so that instead of being an anchor tag it is an img tag? http://jsfiddle.net/4ck4f/4/
[08:13:45] <__itsme> Just do $("[id^=aktiv]") to get everything with an ID beginning with "aktiv".  No need to specify element type
[08:14:01] <duch_kazatel> __itsme that's going to be slow.
[08:14:33] <decx> because it's actually going to take every single element and check if its attribute id contains that word
[08:14:46] <duch_kazatel> yep
[08:14:47] <__itsme> duch_kazatel - not really.  Slower, yes, but not slow.
[08:14:48] <ericx2x> Nevermind
[08:14:54] <decx> if you must use attribute selectors always minimize the footprint
[08:14:57] <ericx2x> i just needed to put in img tag within the a
[08:15:11] <decx> with context and element
[08:15:12] <duch_kazatel> __itsme fine, "slow by comparison"
[08:15:22] <duch_kazatel> avoid global attribute selectors whenever you can.
[08:15:29] <duch_kazatel> or just use a class.
[08:15:48] <__itsme> In this particular case it's fine, but using a class would be the best solution
[08:16:39] <duch_kazatel> imo using an attribute contains selector against IDs is never "fine", but others will disagree i'm sure.
[08:16:43] <MikeD_> do you know those id are inside another id ?  $("#parentid").find( ... )  ?
[08:16:51] <__itsme> good for you
[08:17:21] <duch_kazatel> wow, somebody is cranky all ready!  congrats!
[08:17:44] <decx> i wasnt but you wrote all ready so now i am
[08:18:27] <__itsme> Using generalisation when being asked for a specific scenario solution is not a good idea.  If there are several element types that meet the search criteria then it's quicker to do what I suggested than any other way.  If he can add a class then that would be ideal.
[08:19:18] <decx> an attribute selector for an initial collection isnt ideal in any scenario i'd say
[08:19:51] <decx> minimize exposure with class or context and then filter what you want
[08:20:53] <__itsme> This is all semantics.  Without the html in front of us we can't say what's best and what's not, other than the clear choices of ID, class name, element type etc..

[08:32:22] <Sal> Fr4NgUs, how does the image change?
[08:32:24] <decx> $(this).closest('table').length
[08:33:22] <MikeD_> is there a jquery setting for 'tell me when I'm being dumb' ?  I just spent 20 minutes trying to figure out that I typed 'textbox' for a selector instead of 'textarea'
[08:35:29] <Fr4NgUs> Yes when the img src
[08:36:13] <Fr4NgUs> Sal : when the src change i want submit a form
[08:36:25] <Fr4NgUs> Sal : onchange is not supported by ie :(
[08:36:42] <Sal> yues, but how does the src change? from ajax call? from user interaction?
[08:38:01] <Fr4NgUs> usr interaction
[08:38:24] <Sal> just put the exec submit there, after the interaction
[08:38:45] <Sal> if its a drag and drop, put it on drop
[08:38:55] <Sal> if its a button click, put it on the click
[08:39:00] <Fr4NgUs> onclick
[08:39:05] <Sal> forget about the src chzange
[08:39:35] <Sal> ok, so onlick, change src and then exec form submit
[08:39:48] <Fr4NgUs> onclick="document.getElementById('files').click()"
[08:39:57] <Fr4NgUs> and files is my form submit image
[08:40:19] <Fr4NgUs> and after document.getElementById("files").onchange -> function() ....
[08:40:28] <Fr4NgUs> you see ?
[08:40:35] <qwerty121> Hey guys, I am building a website with isotope jquery plugin. It's horizontal layout site. Please check here: http://dev.protosyte.com/2014/raeken.com/codes/brand/adidas/ I don't like the empty spaces. Is there any solution to it?
[08:41:24] <Sal> onclick="document.getElementById('files').click(): exec_submit_form()"
[08:41:50] <Sal> ops, that should be a semicolon
[08:42:33] <Fr4NgUs> Sal : no vecause before he must select afile
[08:42:38] <Fr4NgUs> and after submit
[08:42:47] <Fr4NgUs> your solution does not work
[08:43:04] <Sal> then after the selction
[08:43:20] <Sal> i mean, there are many events that occur before the src change
[08:43:23] <Sal> use one of them
[08:44:04] <BillCriswell> qwerty121: You can try the packery layout, which you'd need to install: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/layout-modes/packery.html
[08:45:04] <Fr4NgUs> Sal : can you give me one of them ?
[08:45:06] <BillCriswell> qwerty121: I was trying for something as simple as this though: https://myspace.com/ Really considering writing something for my own needs there though.
[08:45:11] <Fr4NgUs> Sal : i try to figured out
[08:46:11] <qwerty121> BillCriswell: yes, this site i am building is based on myspace's layout
[08:46:46] <qwerty121> BillCriswell: i was wonering which layout myspace uses
[08:47:14] <qwerty121> because their layout almost remains the same even on bigger displays
[08:47:30] <BillCriswell> qwerty121: I'd imagine something a little custom. I'm wonder if the layout would be a little easier to accomplish with flexbox. Masonry feels like a lot for that layout.
[08:48:27] <decx> to me this style reeks of: "check out all these bigger boxes because the smaller ones won't get your attention at all - guaranteed"
[08:49:03] <BillCriswell> decx: Absolutely haha.
[08:49:14] <qwerty121> BillCriswell: flexbox?
[08:49:45] <str8uplinux> I have to following json array: [{"id_1":"val_1","id_2":"val_2"}], but I need to push another id/val to it inside the same object. like such: [{"id_1":"val_1","id_2":"val_2","id_3":"val_3"}] How can I accomplish this?
[08:49:50] <BillCriswell> qwerty121: New CSS layout method.
[08:50:12] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm just tired of things being so uniform. I think MySpace's content is delivered pretty well.
[08:50:20] <str8uplinux> I know i can use push, but it creates the following: [{"id_1":"val_1","id_2":"val_2"},{"id_3":"val_3"}]
[08:52:16] <BillCriswell> str8uplinux: You can to do like... jsonArray[0].id_3 = "val_3"; in that case.
[08:54:23] <str8uplinux> BillCriswell: exactly what i was looking for! Thank you very much
[08:54:29] <BillCriswell> str8uplinux: No problem.
[08:56:22] <Fr4NgUs> Sal : ?
[08:56:34] <Fr4NgUs> Sal : i try onclick but the image is not uplaod
[08:56:47] <Fr4NgUs> Sal : I must find onchange equivalent for use my script
[08:57:02] <decx> BillCriswell better than tumblrs tagged page attempt to make things less uniform
[08:57:16] <decx> whoever greenlit that was drunk
[08:57:21] <BillCriswell> Haha
[08:57:53] <BillCriswell> The masonry they use on myspace seems simple at first but I know I'm going to bang my head against the wall 10 minutes into trying it.
[09:05:44] <workerbeetwo> Hey : ) How do I compare a user defined date (dd.mm.yyyy) with new Date ( $.now() )  ?
[09:13:36] <Miles8of9> how can i find the element which follows right after one i know?
[09:13:42] <Miles8of9> .next ?
[09:16:25] <jost> Miles8of9: yes
[09:16:50] <jost> .next([selector]);
[09:17:15] <decx> workerbeetwo you can compare dates like any other number
[09:17:17] <Miles8of9> this.next.text('etc etc');  ?
[09:17:49] <Miles8of9> or it was $(this) ? i don't know the difference
[09:17:50] <systemfault> Miles8of9: Who knows, perhaps .next is a function
[09:18:01] <Miles8of9> !
[09:18:53] <Miles8of9> this.next().text('etc etc'); ... doesn't work :\
[09:19:02] <workerbeetwo> decx: but if its user defined? can I parse the DateString in "dd.MM.yyyy" format?
[09:19:27] <decx> use one of the man parsedate functions or moment.js
[09:19:30] <Miles8of9> it was $(this)!!!
[09:19:30] <decx> many*
[09:31:14] <Miles8of9> http://jsfiddle.net/26xrt/  just for learning purpose... is it right to insert a blank div right after something and then populate it with something if needed?
[09:31:30] <duch_kazatel> modify the div first.
[09:31:52] <duch_kazatel> you want to create a fragment (which $('<div></div>') does) and then work against that before putting that into the document.
[09:32:32] <Miles8of9> ok... but if i do that i must use insertAfter or insertBefore
[09:32:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:33:08] <duch_kazatel> you can work against a fragment like you would any other node.
[09:34:20] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/26xrt/1/
[09:34:30] <jro> I have an html/php page that displays a list of IP addresses and I want to display or color code those addresses depending on the results of an icmp ping of each address when the page is loaded.  Any ideas?
[09:35:01] <duch_kazatel> do that in php and use classes.
[09:35:09] <duch_kazatel> then do your styling via css.
[09:35:50] <decx> whatever you do, don't combine each and ajax when your page comes from php anyway
[09:35:58] <jro> I need the status to change after the page is loaded, ie not waiting for the ping response of 250 addresses
[09:36:10] <jro> like a little loading icon
[09:36:16] <decx> you don't want that
[09:37:19] <Miles8of9> duch_kazatel: let's say you want to make the selected name appear instead of "here is some text" ..?
[09:37:43] <absolutezeroff> http://pastie.org/9409904 what is "this"
[09:38:00] <duch_kazatel> absolutezeroff the current .charity-selector
[09:38:14] <absolutezeroff> k
[09:38:17] <absolutezeroff> thank you
[09:38:45] <decx> use prop instead of attr or native if it's more convenient
[09:38:48] <decx> in this case this.id
[09:38:50] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 then what you've got is fine.
[09:39:03] <Miles8of9> ok thanks
[09:39:10] <duch_kazatel> thogh I might abstract out and not use .next()\
[09:39:31] <duch_kazatel> i might be a little more explicit about which div is for which select.
[09:39:32] <Miles8of9> how?
[09:39:40] <Miles8of9> hmm
[09:39:45] <Miles8of9> how?
[09:40:00] <duch_kazatel> not inserting the div via jquery and using an ID or Class that ties to back to the appropriate select.
[09:40:07] <duch_kazatel> or group then under a div or something similar.
[09:42:00] <Miles8of9> is it possible to generate some random unique id for the div and then use it?
[09:42:32] <duch_kazatel> :( why are you inserting markup like that? why not just setup your HTML the right way ahead of time?
[09:43:00] <Miles8of9> ahahah i'm a jquery noob!!
[09:43:49] <Miles8of9> your ears would cry if you could read the code i used to write 6 years ago!!
[09:44:57] <Zzaichik> why wouldn't my eyeballs cry?
[09:45:07] <Zzaichik> if they're doing the reading
[09:45:08] <duch_kazatel> because he's reading to us (wat)
[09:45:13] <Zzaichik> haha oh
[09:45:17] <duch_kazatel> i guess?
[09:45:22] <Miles8of9> lol right
[09:46:01] <Zzaichik> okay I gotcha *backs out of conversation slowly*
[09:47:35] <duch_kazatel> Do something like this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/26xrt/5/
[09:48:07] <duch_kazatel> it's more verbose, but as you build shit and want to change things around, it'll be a little easier to understand and modify.
[09:48:57] <Miles8of9> ah interesting
[09:49:28] <duch_kazatel> also, since you're not using the value attribute on your options, you can do $this.val() for your text.
[09:49:33] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/26xrt/6/
[09:50:24] <Miles8of9> well of a real case i would use option values
[09:56:11] <AcidRain> http://pastebin.com/ea4f7mJa why does this not loop through all data attributes?
[09:56:39] <AcidRain> <a href="#" data-path="link1.php" data-test="zomg" data-test1="haxor">My Link</a>
[10:01:54] <decx> whats your usecase for serializing data?
[10:02:24] <AcidRain> well to eventually pass it as post data, where it will be parsed by a php script
[10:02:54] <decx> dont you look at the console?
[10:02:59] <decx> it's right there
[10:03:03] <decx> staring you in the face
[10:03:55] <AcidRain> ReferenceError: theData is not defined
[10:03:57] <AcidRain> hmmm
[10:04:00] <decx> hint: like a public budget you are missing the dollars
[10:04:18] <AcidRain> lol
[10:04:19] <AcidRain> nice hint
[10:04:30] <decx> exactly why i don't use $ for vars
[10:09:05] <duch_kazatel> what's up?
[10:13:56] <decx> work hours are up and i can finally dig into this interesting technique http://jsfiddle.net/decx/q6k8g/3/
[10:14:05] <MikeD_> i have three categories of lists   .find( "li" ).filter(':odd').addClass('zebra');  potentially starts each category with a different 'zebra' stripe?   can I iterate first on the category, then on odd/even in a single statement?
[10:15:12] <karamazov> Ah that makes sense - I was running a timeline to try and find out what JS even was being triggered.
[10:15:19] <karamazov> wrong windo
[10:21:00] <decx> MikeD_ i dont get it so 2 lists -1,2,3- with 1 starting bright and -4,5,6- with 4 starting dark ?
[10:22:34] <MikeD_> that's how it was, yeah - i didn't like that because it put a dark item against the dark header row
[10:22:55] <decx> oh so you don't want that
[10:23:02] <decx> why not use css for that anyway
[10:23:15] <decx> ul li:nth-child(odd) {
[10:23:25] <MikeD_> right
[10:23:57] <MikeD_> and when you have to provide a kludge for the internet slow-kid...  you use jquery to add classes :)
[10:27:00] <decx> but :odd shouldnt do that anyway
[10:27:50] <MikeD_> if all the elements found are in a list, iterated and determined by index % 2 = 1 (odd)  then the first element is 0, so even.
[10:27:58] <MikeD_> yeah, kinda backwards, but whatever
[10:31:23] <guy> anyone know of "plugin" for inverse of http://fittextjs.com/? I have text and I want the container to adapt to use least possible space horizontally-vertically
[10:33:11] <antlong> which would otherwise be achieved by using auto width?
[10:33:23] <drej> antlong only for a singular line of text
[10:33:37] <antlong> interesting
[10:33:48] <drej> as in, it'll only work for a singular line of text, but not multiple
[10:33:58] <decx> i don't get either
[10:34:22] * drej hugs decx 
[10:34:23] <drej> it'll be okay
[10:34:59] <guy> oh right.. I think this can be achieved using max-width
[10:35:03] <antlong> guy ;)
[10:35:04] <guy> or am I being delusional
[10:35:12] <antlong> you're overcomplicating perhaps
[10:35:13] <drej> guy it should be adaptive based on content
[10:35:19] <drej> if thats waht youre getting at
[10:35:40] <decx> what like display: inline
[10:36:08] <decx> even with the power of hugs i don't get it
[10:38:39] <guy> yeah, what I wanted can be achieved simply with min-/max- width
[10:43:35] <decx> MikeD_ apparently :odd does indeed use i % 2 for the whole collection; but if you use .filter(function(){ return $(this).index() % 2 }) it'll be relative to it's parent again
[10:43:44] <decx> its*
[10:46:56] <MikeD_> interesting
[10:47:24] <drej> is it ?
[10:47:26] <drej> is it, really?
[10:47:39] <decx> mildly
[10:48:00] <jeremib> What's the proper way to handle event handlers inside of a class?  I want to be able to call this.addItemRow (method on my class) on a click event.  If I just pass this.addItemRow as the 2nd param to the trigger, it calls it, but because it's an a tag, it goes to the url (#).  I need to be able to preventDefault and use this within the the passed in function.
[10:48:08] <jeremib> Here's my code
[10:48:21] <jeremib> function BillMaint(){
[10:48:21] <jeremib>     this.attachHandlers = function() {
[10:48:21] <jeremib>         $j('#add-item-row-btn').off().on('click', function(ev) {
[10:48:23] <jeremib>             ev.preventDefault();
[10:48:25] <jeremib>             this.addItemRow();
[10:48:27] <jeremib>         });
[10:48:29] <jeremib>     };
[10:48:31] <jeremib> }
[10:48:33] <MikeD_> interesting - but not enough that i'd take the time to confirm it myself  :p
[10:48:51] <MikeD_> (so thanks)
[10:48:59] <jeremib> this.addItemRow -> the 'this' variable now references the event, and not my BillMaint class
[10:49:12] <MikeD_> jeremib: jsfiddle.net
[10:49:27] <jeremib> MikeD_: OK
[10:51:04] <ericx2x> Hey i'm trying to follow this codepen example but i'm having trouble.. I'm missing something important. I can't even manage to replicate it in jsfiddle
[10:51:15] <ericx2x> I can't seem to get the zoom effect to happen

[10:51:56] <ericx2x> what am I doing differently?
[10:52:04] <decx> jsfiddle doesnt do scss
[10:53:25] <ericx2x> decx:  thank you
[10:53:47] <decx> if i copy the compiled css over to your fiddle it works
[10:54:52] <jeremib> http://jsfiddle.net/wF8Y7/2/

[10:55:17] <PantsOfChoco> http://jsfiddle.net/xCsQ9/ with this jquery, I have an element that is the parent of the parent of the parent etc of the a.next and a.page variables, what is the best way to get the parent that is named load_reviews isntead of doing like 8 parentNodes or is there a different way i can do this? The document on is kind of necessary since its imported from django using a different template

[10:55:50] <decx> til
[10:56:55] <jeremib> nm, I got it
[11:11:57] <antlong> how do you find elements by partial class?
[11:12:17] <duch_kazatel> an 'attribute contains selector
[11:13:08] <antlong> isn't there a way to pass it in the $("this_area")
[11:16:08] <Miles8of9> how do i set the value of a input text? .text()?
[11:16:10] <duch_kazatel> that's where you put it, yes.
[11:16:16] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 use .val()
[11:16:38] <Miles8of9> duch_kazatel: i want to set the value not read it
[11:16:49] <duch_kazatel> Miles8of9 right - .val('new string here')
[11:16:56] <Miles8of9> ah ok
[11:16:56] <duch_kazatel> the api docs are a helluva drug.
[11:17:30] <duch_kazatel> antlong $('[class*="someClassNameSubString"');
[11:18:06] <duch_kazatel> there's also a startswith iirc.
[11:19:03] <decx> ^
[11:19:10] <drej> ^=
[11:19:12] <antlong> ah right thanks
[11:20:33] <decx> what's that drej, some kind of kawaii mutant?
[11:20:45] <drej> wassat?
[11:21:11] <duch_kazatel> decx you're in Germany, right?
[11:21:20] <decx> i am
[11:21:47] <duch_kazatel> did you hear about Stone Brewing Co. opening up a new brewery in Berlin?
[11:22:07] <decx> i don't follow the beer scene
[11:22:15] <PantsOfChoco> most ungerman thing ever said
[11:22:36] <duch_kazatel> hahaha.
[11:22:55] <decx> indeed
[11:24:29] <PantsOfChoco> thats like saying you dont care about high quality vehicles and  lederhosen
[11:24:52] <duch_kazatel> last i heard most germans really aren't all that aware of/interested in craft beer.
[11:25:14] <PantsOfChoco> its big in america more than any other country id say
[11:25:23] <decx> they are actually offended by it
[11:25:23] <sbravo> beer = gud
[11:25:23] <duch_kazatel> the last few decades yeah.
[11:25:37] <duch_kazatel> decx yeah, because it works against history right?
[11:25:47] <decx> beer dogmatism
[11:26:11] <p5yh05T> My script ain't running; (
[11:26:17] <PantsOfChoco> haha just the idea of a mind altering beverage as dogmatic makes me laugh
[11:26:41] <decx> PantsOfChoco http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot
[11:26:49] <decx> it's serious business
[11:26:51] <sbravo> clear
[11:31:43] <duch_kazatel> decx yeah when I was in berlin a few years ago i tried a few different beers and wasn't really impressed.
[11:32:32] <decx> beer fundamentalists will say your tastebuds have been tainted by years of wrong consumption
[11:32:52] <duch_kazatel> they'd be wrong: i'd hardly ever drank beer before then :)
[11:33:15] <PantsOfChoco> theyd be horribly right in my case COLLEGE WOOO
[11:33:16] <duch_kazatel> the czechs are better imo.
[11:36:01] <decx> i don't think taste can be described objectively
[11:36:24] <duch_kazatel> not at all - preference is what it is ;)  guess i shoulda slapped a "to me" on the end of that.
[11:38:00] <drej> you can objectively say that an apple has a sweet taste
[11:38:29] <PantsOfChoco> but the taste of an apple to me, is it the same or is my apple your banana?
[11:38:45] <duch_kazatel> you can objectively say that an apple has a sweet taste to most people, assuming they have not had their taste buds previously mucked with.  miracle berry demonstrates that one pretty well.
[11:38:52] <MikeD_> are we really discussing qualia in #jquery?
[11:38:57] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:39:11] <decx> green apples aren't distinctively sweet
[11:39:24] <docmur_> I'm having trouble with some code that takes a return value from PHP and should carry out an action.  The problem is no matter what I return from PHP {"status":"success"} or {"status":"error"} my jQuery only ever sees status as success, can anyone see why?  I posted both sections of code, both the PHP and jQuery, I put the PHP output into a header DIV so I can see what it's sending back, so something is wrong eith the jQuery.  This is the code:
[11:39:33] <MikeD_> what color is an invisible unicorn?
[11:39:49] <PantsOfChoco> JQUERY CAN WAIT MAN ITS QUALIA TIME
[11:39:51] <duch_kazatel> docmur where's the code?
[11:39:51] <NoiseEee> docmur_: because both are successful (200) responses
[11:39:56] <decx> ultraviolet of course
[11:40:14] <NoiseEee> docmur_: so check the 'status' of your returned JSON ya know
[11:40:17] <drej> PantsOfChoco i only just met you, please refrain from talking about my banana
[11:40:18] <drej> thanks
[11:40:23] <duch_kazatel> drej++
[11:40:36] <MikeD_> qualia conversations are about the redness of red, so ultraviolet is the wrong end of the spectrum  :P
[11:40:40] <decx> he wants the P
[11:40:49] <PantsOfChoco> i want the b
[11:40:51] <PantsOfChoco> for banana
[11:41:27] <docmur_> How would I do that?, would it be status.status?
[11:42:01] <NoiseEee> docmur_: whateverYouNameYourReturnedDataVariable.status
[11:42:15] <duch_kazatel> docmur_ we didn't see the code you posted.  it cut off.
[11:43:07] <antlong> I'm using tooltipster, when i hover an object, i see the tooltips content added to the dom, when i mouse off, it appears that its removed from the dom. is this accurate?
[11:43:20] <duch_kazatel> antlong prolly?

[11:44:20] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[11:44:22] <docmur_> this is the code: http://pastie.org/9410128
[11:44:44] <Bloomberg> how can I set the title of a tag with the data-id of itself
[11:44:44] <duch_kazatel> don't use alert() btw.
[11:44:47] <duch_kazatel> using console.log()
[11:44:52] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg do what now?
[11:44:58] <dllama1> hey guys
[11:45:12] <Bloomberg> for example
[11:45:46] <Bloomberg> <a data-id="dinamicContent" title=""this.data-id""></a>
[11:45:55] <Bloomberg> something like this
[11:46:13] <decx> wat?
[11:46:29] <duch_kazatel> you want to set the title attribute to the data-id value?
[11:46:45] <dllama1> might anyone be able to recommend a masking plugin to go along with parsleyjs ?  seems the one i'm using (http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/) doesn't seem to play very nice with parsley and i haven't been able to figure out a way to make them work together.
[11:46:54] <Bloomberg> yes
[11:47:06] <decx> don't do that with js
[11:47:09] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg by doing in the backend.
[11:47:13] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible idea with js.
[11:47:27] <Bloomberg> and from html is possible?
[11:47:38] <duch_kazatel> don't do it dynamically.
[11:47:42] <duch_kazatel> do it using your backend.
[11:48:08] <drej> kinky
[11:48:28] <duch_kazatel> ;D
[11:54:42] <AcidRain> $(".obvioushax").on("click", "a", function() {        <a href="#" class="obvioushax">My Link</a>
[11:54:44] <AcidRain> doesnt fire :(
[11:54:50] <duch_kazatel> wat.
[11:55:12] <duch_kazatel> does your <a> get added after the page loads?
[11:55:22] <AcidRain> no
[11:55:26] <decx> that's not how delegation works
[11:55:35] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah that's wrong.
[11:55:42] <duch_kazatel> obvioushax needs to be a parent of the a tag.
[11:55:56] <AcidRain> >_> shit
[11:55:57] <AcidRain> yep
[11:56:00] <decx> you should really read the api docs sometimes, they are good
[11:56:05] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[11:56:09] <duch_kazatel> $(".obvioushax").on("click", function() {
[12:07:10] <PantsOfChoco> jquery is a jerk
[12:15:25] <docmur_> I tried status.status == "success" but it doesn't seem to work.  To see what status.status would contain would I do:  console.log(status.status.val())?
[12:18:07] <Vivekananda_y510> __itsme, thanks. I did not wish to ask you to walk me through but rather I was just asking how you how you figured out that those two files were being used to send data or capture stuff
[12:18:36] <NoiseEee> yourXHR.done(function(data) { if(data.status!=='success') { //oh man, you had a successful server response but presumably a bad result on the backend in some way}); @ docmur_
[12:18:45] <AcidRain> http://pastebin.com/VLuXRVj5 am i on the right path to building my own lil front controller?
[12:40:34] <docmur_> Okay so using  $("#header").load("PHP/loginForm.php",$("#loginBox").serialize(),function( data ), when I do alert(data), I can see {"status":"success"} and {"status":"error"} but when I do if(data.status=="success") or if(data.status==="success") it always fails.
[12:40:55] <duch_kazatel> use console.log() instead.
[12:41:14] <docmur_> okay, I can make it console.log
[12:41:35] <duch_kazatel> do console.log(data.status) - what do you get?
[12:42:39] <docmur_> This is the output of console.log(data) and console.log(data.status); docmur<br>1<br>wanttoprint<br>{"status":"success"} (index):55
[12:42:44] <docmur_> undefined
[12:43:11] <duch_kazatel> see why your if() check is failing?
[12:43:48] <docmur_> I thought JSON values are key, value pairs?  so {"status":"success"}, success would be the value of the key status
[12:43:51] <docmur_> how else do I check it?
[12:44:09] <duch_kazatel> do the console.log(data) again and screenshot your console
[12:44:12] <duch_kazatel> something seems off.
[12:44:36] <docmur_> This is literally what console.log(data) will return: {"status":"success"}
[12:45:08] <duch_kazatel> what was  docmur<br>1<br>wanttoprint<br>{"status":"success"} (index):55 about earlier, then?
[12:45:22] <duch_kazatel> ah, it sounds like you're returning a string.
[12:45:26] <docmur_> Oh I copied extra stuff that I was echoing back from the server program
[12:45:47] <docmur_> Right but if the jQuery is looking for JSON then shouldn't it only see the {"X":"y"}?
[12:45:55] <docmur_> or only care about
[12:45:56] <duch_kazatel> you're giving it a string, not JSON.
[12:45:59] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse
[12:46:05] <duch_kazatel> parse that first, then try to read it.
[12:47:01] <docmur_> So basically it's seeing all the other echos and it can't automatically seperate out the JSON without me parsing it?
[12:47:25] <duch_kazatel> i don't know what your return data really looks like (which is why I asked for the screenshot), but I wonder if you're returning a string instead of JSON.
[12:48:03] <duch_kazatel> but now i'm very confused.  to be clear, iof docmur<br>1<br>wanttoprint<br>{"status":"success"} is the entire return from the server, then that's no good.
[12:48:18] <duch_kazatel> you can only return the JSON - javascript/jquery can decide what's what.
[12:49:26] <docmur_> Well I chagned it now to only return that JSON, {"status":"error"} and {"status":"success"}, so if I do console.log(data), I can see those two responses from my PHP,  My PHP echo line is: echo json_encode($response_array);
[12:49:46] <docmur_> $response_array is $response_array['status'] = 'success' OR 'error'
[12:49:49] <duch_kazatel> i don't know PHP so i can't help you there.  but that should be correct.  that should work.
[12:50:06] <docmur_> console.log(data.status) is still returning undefined
[12:50:15] <duch_kazatel> console.log(data) again.
[12:51:46] <duch_kazatel> also: if you're in chrome's console, the return from that console log should look something like this: http://i.imgur.com/jLU44Mj.png
[12:53:51] <docmur_> http://i.imgur.com/7NEWvLq.png  I did one submit with a correct name and one submit with an inccorect submit
[12:53:58] <docmur_> I also added headings with console.log
[12:56:58] <utterly_confused> hello all
[12:57:07] <utterly_confused> Has any of you fellows ever used select2?
[13:04:56] <Lost123> hi everyone http://pastie.org/9410277
[13:05:21] <Lost123> i am trying to get id but cannot, please see paste and the problem written below it.
[13:05:30] <docmur_> Got it!  I had to do JSON.parse(data).status === "success", I guess i had to run the parser to get the data out of the JSON format, not sure why jQuery just can't read it own data format :S
[13:05:32] <Lost123> any suggestions?
[13:08:15] <Lost123> is an element is hidden, can we get its id?
[13:10:09] <decx> that's one deep list
[13:11:34] <Lost123> in mouseout i am setting visibility hidden for all submenu uls, so is this the reason why when i click and then mouseout, i cannot get the id of the element?
[13:12:52] <duch_kazatel> docmur that's not a jquery issue.
[13:12:54] <duch_kazatel> that's a javascript issue.
[13:15:02] <fonsA2> Hello. I need a way to grab the timezone abbreviation of an end user. Would this be a good way of doing that: http://pastebin.com/TFLsnzcs. If not, what are my other options?
[13:20:20] <duch_kazatel> use moment.js if you're going to do a lot of datetime stuff.
[13:21:20] <duch_kazatel> or check out this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2897478/get-client-timezone-not-gmt-offset-amount-in-js
[13:22:00] <fonsA2> It's a value for one form field that needs to be submitted to an api...but it is required so it can never be sent to the api as null
[13:22:30] <duch_kazatel> okay?  that has nothing to do with your question.
[13:22:41] <duch_kazatel> if you're going to use the date object a bunch, use moment.js instead
[13:23:06] <fonsA2> thanks. looking at it right now
[13:25:11] <decx> wasnt there a function for that?
[13:25:17] <decx> offsetsomething
[13:25:45] <duch_kazatel> they want the friendly abbreviation.  without something like moment, you can't get that without some parsing.
[13:29:14] <pawelbx> hi, in ie8, if i include jquery (version 1.4.2) and i declare the variable $ like so: var $; , and then i try to print the variables value, and i get undefined. why?
[13:29:41] <duch_kazatel> are you declaring $ after you including jquery?
[13:29:47] <pawelbx> yes
[13:29:51] <duch_kazatel> that's why
[13:30:06] <pawelbx> that doesn't make sense this only happens in IE 8
[13:30:21] <duch_kazatel> you're also using an ancient version of jquery.
[13:30:24] <pawelbx> redeclaring a variable should have no effect
[13:32:38] <frank_o> pawelbx: do yourself a favor and ban all old versions of ie from your site
[13:32:50] <frank_o> :P
[13:32:53] <pawelbx> i wish
[13:33:06] <duch_kazatel> frank_o some of us can't afford that luxury ;)
[13:33:28] <frank_o> much respect to those folks
[13:33:55] <duch_kazatel> hell, we still make a good amount with it.
[13:34:06] <duch_kazatel> pawelbx i can reasonably replicate that locally.
[13:34:27] <duch_kazatel> might be a quirk in the way IE8's jscript engine works.
[13:35:10] <pawelbx> i'm amazed by this
[13:35:33] <duch_kazatel> i'm not.
[13:35:33] <pawelbx> but maybe i shouldn't be... it is ie
[13:35:35] <duch_kazatel> it's IE.
[13:35:38] <duch_kazatel> *old IE
[13:35:43] <pawelbx> yea
[13:36:29] <pawelbx> ok thanks. i thought maybe i was going crazy
[13:36:41] <duch_kazatel> why are you redeclaring $ anyway?
[13:36:44] <decx> you know, IE is german for eek
[13:37:09] <drej> ie!
[13:37:20] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha really? that's awesome.
[13:37:30] <pawelbx> duch_kazatel: it's a long story.
[13:37:36] <pawelbx> i have to go now thanks!
[13:38:27] <thebope> lol that is awesome
[13:40:53] <duch_kazatel> i think i'm going to try switching exclusively to IE at some point for at least a little while.
[13:51:11] <iamviknesh> can anyone look into this , i created  <li> in js and appended to <ul> tag . but it dosent appear as list
[13:51:26] <iamviknesh> https://github.com/vikneshwar/code
[13:52:37] <duch_kazatel> which file am I looking at?
[13:54:05] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: asking me ?
[13:54:08] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:54:38] <duch_kazatel> why are you mixing jquery with vanilla js like that?
[13:55:05] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: js/custom.js
[13:55:11] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/gUGAf/
[13:55:16] <duch_kazatel> already setup the fiddle for you :0
[13:55:26] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: sorry , i am new to js and jquery
[13:56:55] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: so mixing normal js with jquery would have any side effect ?
[13:57:11] <duch_kazatel> just wondering if you did that on purpose.
[13:57:36] <duch_kazatel> also: those var statements in that loop are bad.
[13:58:20] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: yeah i know , each time it creates a new element , i can put that in outer loop
[13:58:29] <iamviknesh> sorry out of the loop
[13:58:39] <duch_kazatel> not just that - loops don't have their own scope.
[13:59:27] <duch_kazatel> also that switch could use some fallthrough instead of what you're doing now.
[13:59:52] <duch_kazatel> also, don't do generateList('Sorting')
[13:59:55] <naeluh> yo
[13:59:58] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: so what should i do ,  sorry if i ask silly question
[13:59:59] <duch_kazatel> *don't do that inline with your html.
[14:00:04] <duch_kazatel> bind using .on() instead.
[14:00:27] <wunz> ^ jquery/js-101
[14:01:03] <wunz> iamviknesh: if it was up to him, he'd rewrite it, but to get what you requested, it'll switch it to pure jq
[14:01:16] <duch_kazatel> pretty much.
[14:01:24] <MikeD_> can i select either tag via myobject.on('click', ['div','dd'], function(){ ... } )  ?
[14:01:49] <duch_kazatel> you want a css selector there.
[14:01:56] <duch_kazatel> like the docs say./
[14:02:05] <duch_kazatel> well, a jquery selector, which is similar/.
[14:02:11] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: yeah just testing , i would add those inline events to js :)
[14:02:22] <MikeD_> i had "div, dd" and it didn't work... the array does
[14:02:32] <iamviknesh> wunz: thanks :)
[14:02:45] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ myobject.on('click', 'div, dd', function(){ ... } )  ? should work
[14:03:03] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh it's much easier to do it the right way the first time around ;)
[14:03:11] <MikeD_> lemme try again
[14:03:18] <lunks> Hey, is there an easy drop-in solution to jQuery doing CORS on IE8+?
[14:04:48] <duch_kazatel> lunks https://github.com/dkastner/jquery.iecors might work
[14:04:49] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: ok will do now , where should i add css selector ?
[14:04:58] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh i was talking to MikeD_
[14:05:13] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh if you'd like to learn about jquery, try learn.jquery.com
[14:05:41] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: thanks
[14:05:46] <MikeD_> it didn't - no problem, the array notation is self-evident too
[14:05:56] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ that doesn't make sense.
[14:06:06] * iamviknesh heading to learn.jquery.com 
[14:06:36] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ it should be a string, not an array.
[14:06:44] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery?
[14:09:01] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/qpJmg/1/ <-- should be like this.
[14:15:20] <lunks> duch_kazatel: Thanks!
[14:15:38] <lunks> It behaves a little bit differently than on other browsers, but oh well.
[14:16:32] <MikeD_> then why does the array work?
[14:18:03] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ i don't know.  you should probably share your code and not rely on something nonstandard.
[14:18:11] <duch_kazatel> just because it works doesn't mean you should rely on it.
[14:23:31] <decx> sneaky anchor there duch_kazatel, i was wondering why it always fired .one
[14:26:32] <hxm> guys i dont know where to ask here, in this http://eggdrop.es/scripts/useruptime/ the green button points to a .tar.gz file that works in chrome but not in firefox, but if i paste the link on the inputbox it works, and i see some errors in the console, is that really?
[14:31:57] <DaveOfWest> Hey, why is it that when I click on my page, nothing happens though I've written this code? Is there something fundamental that I'm missing here?? Thank you. http://jsfiddle.net/Tdk8H/1/
[14:33:16] <Ansikt> Click should be a string

[14:39:08] <sc_> how about putting 25%, 50%, 75%, 99% width calls for a div throughout your function?
[14:39:15] <sc_> aka, no idea :)

[14:40:01] <juboba> let's see
[14:40:26] <Ansikt> onprogress, sorry
[14:40:38] <decx> if you dont want to deal with that you can set to 16% on click, and then animate to 100% on success
[14:40:44] <decx> ^^
[14:41:44] <juboba> Ansikt: aha

[14:46:43] <ezio> do i need to do this var methods = { a($context){ var settings = $context.data('foo'); ... $.getJson(function() { var settings = $context.data('foo'); ...
[14:46:59] <ezio> so that i can get the settings again
[14:47:10] <ezio> in case the data has changed
[14:48:08] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:48:27] <duch_kazatel> oh you want a place to store original values?
[14:48:29] <ezio> if i call getjson inside a method in my plugin
[14:48:47] <ezio> do i have to regrab the .data
[14:48:50] <ezio> as it might have changed
[14:49:30] <duch_kazatel> data shouldn't change by virtue of calling getJson
[14:49:54] <Ansikt> ezio - I think getJSON defaults to cache:true unless it's jsonp
[14:49:56] <ezio> duch_kazatel, right but it could change between the call of getjson and the success
[14:49:58] <ezio> call back
[14:50:01] <Ansikt> Let me check that, that might be wrong
[14:51:28] <Ansikt> yeah, getJSON defaults to cache for non-jsonp.
[14:52:19] <ezio> yeah but the issue being something on the client could change a value in .data
[14:52:26] <ezio> between the json
[14:52:32] <ezio> and the success
[14:53:16] <ezio> like, the json could take 4 minutes to complete.  a lot could happen that gets saved to the data during that time
[14:53:39] <duch_kazatel> let me make sure i'm understanding correctly - you're firing getJson requests that rely on node data having certain values and then changing that data?
[14:53:55] <duch_kazatel> ezio something seems off.
[14:54:01] <shoky> ezio: if the data is a reference value, like an array or an object, and it's onnly entries/properties of the array/object that are changing, you don't need to re-fetch it
[14:54:23] <ezio> shoky, understands me
[14:54:27] <ezio> how do i know
[14:54:45] <shoky> "settings" seems like it'd be an object
[14:54:57] <ezio> yeah ... like it copied the object
[14:55:00] <ezio> not a ref
[14:56:23] <shoky> if it's an object then it just copies the ref
[14:57:19] <shoky> anyways, you only need to re-fetch if it was rewritten using .data('foo', newsettings)
[14:58:38] <ezio> shoky, that's exactly what i'm saying
[14:58:43] <ezio> so i have to do that; eh
[14:58:49] <ezio> there's no easier way?
[14:58:55] <duch_kazatel> i'm still lost about wtf is going on hahahaha
[14:59:11] <Ansikt> what?
[14:59:48] <Ansikt> getJSON returns a parsed JSON strings....even if the two JSON responses are the same, you'll have different object references.  But I'm probably wildly misunderstanding.
[14:59:54] <shoky> heh he's just asking about whether he should call .data again to fetch his data, or can he use the original "settings" reference
[15:00:02] <duch_kazatel> ah
[15:00:48] <Ansikt> Ahhh.  I think that would really have to be tuned per app.  I guess if it changes that much, then you should.
[15:03:06] <shoky> ezio: the easier way is not to rewrite it with a different object ;p
[15:04:33] <duch_kazatel> i'd rethink whatever is it that's going on and go from there.
[15:08:10] <ezio> http://jsfiddle.net/sJq46/1/
[15:08:35] <ezio> duch_kazatel, many things in the plugin could go on in that time and there needs to be local persistence
[15:09:12] <ezio> duch_kazatel, someone could start a new scan and there would be a different amount of hosts
[15:09:36] <ezio> it could take a long time for an asynchronous call to come back
[15:10:20] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/sJq46/1/
[15:10:26] <duch_kazatel> woops wrong window.
[15:10:47] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle isn't loading for me.  wtf
[15:11:12] <decx> same
[15:11:24] <ezio> yeah i had to keep refreshing
[15:11:29] <decx> that'll help
[15:11:30] <ezio> it's being a jerk
[15:12:03] <duch_kazatel> if you need persistent storage, you should create an object elswhere that isn't attached to nodes imo.
[15:13:40] <ezio> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/stateful-plugins-with-widget-factory/
[15:14:02] <duch_kazatel> that's for plugins.  are you writing a plugin?
[15:16:11] <ezio> duch_kazatel, yes
[15:16:24] <ezio> <ezio> if i call getjson inside a method in my plugin
[15:16:36] <ezio> but it doesn't really need to be for plugins
[15:17:03] <ezio> persisiting data on elements is what it was originally intended for
[15:17:19] <duch_kazatel> didn't see that part, but I disagree.  if i'm not writing a plugin and i need to maintain state, i wouldn't use data on a node personally.
[15:19:08] <ezio> duch_kazatel, as is your right but this idea for plugins came after .data already existed
[15:20:59] <duch_kazatel> lol you're the one having problems with .data() ;)
[15:21:42] <ezio> the only problem i'm having is it looks ugly to do this.  in fact, i can think of at least one prettier way to do this.
[15:22:22] <ezio> transfer the object to the namespace and always refer to it there
[15:22:40] <duch_kazatel> that's why i don't attach data to nodes if I can avoid it.
[15:23:00] <ezio> you still have to attach to the node so that future calls to your plugin have state
[15:23:09] <duch_kazatel> why?
[15:23:15] <duch_kazatel> why not store state in an object elsehwere?
[15:23:25] <ezio> so you can call further methods on an already created plugin
[15:23:28] <ezio> 'show'
[15:23:32] <ezio> 'resolve_hosts'
[15:23:47] <duch_kazatel> without seeing what you're actually doing, it's hard to know if that's really the right thing to do, but whatever helps you sleep :)
[15:23:48] <ezio> 'hide'
[15:23:53] <shoky> even if you use .data .. just don't overwrite the object
[15:25:12] <ezio> shoky, i have to have some way to update it ... in the case that new hosts come in ... or user clicks arbitrary control on the interface and the settings need to be updated
[15:25:25] <shoky> settings.hosts = 'bla'
[15:25:48] <ezio> yeah.  okay.  and settings is just on the name space right?
[15:25:59] <shoky> a var that's in scope
[15:26:03] <duch_kazatel> js doesn't have namespaces.
[15:26:30] <shoky> like your first "var settings" in your 1st example
[15:26:35] <ezio> duch_kazatel, not literally but the namespace of my plugin ... ie. $fn.mywidget.settings
[15:26:56] <duch_kazatel> yeah the property you're working inside of.
[15:27:20] <ezio> yes ... but really this is to make it seem object oriented, so namespace is actually more appropriate
[15:27:21] <shoky> mm
[15:27:26] <shoky> you're using the widget factory?
[15:27:35] <ezio> no
[15:27:39] <ezio> hand made widgets
[15:27:49] <duch_kazatel> "make it seem object oriented" - good luck with that ;)
[15:28:25] <shoky> ezio: ok , you just linked to a widget factory article..
[15:29:26] <ezio> duch_kazatel, you're an idiot.  there's a lot to be said about javascript oop and that is exactly what's happening here.  maybe you should read something before you keep telling people they're wrong because you just keep trying to shove things in my face and it ain't working, prick
[15:29:38] <duch_kazatel> what the fuck.
[15:29:41] <ezio> shoky, yeah it was the first article that i came across with .data
[15:29:49] <duch_kazatel> welp.
[15:30:00] <duch_kazatel> don't take things so personally.
[15:30:20] <duch_kazatel> i'll let you have your fit.  i'm out for a while.  bye.
[15:30:26] <shoky> eep
[15:30:33] <shoky> bye duch
[15:30:40] <ezio> sorry but he wanted to have an argument about everything
[15:30:57] <shoky> not really. he's one of the most helpful people on this channel
[15:31:03] <shoky> you should chill :P
[15:31:18] <ezio> okay
[15:31:20] <ezio> calm
[15:31:22] <ezio> :)
[15:31:38] <ezio> thanks a lot btw
[15:32:26] <shoky> np
[15:34:36] <io_____> hi I am doing something like this http://codepad.org/eBDpfrCA , it works but many img elements are created when the browser is resized, is there a smarter way to achieve the same result ?
[15:35:14] <oksushi> `live @ io_____
[15:35:15] <b-ot> io_____: deprecated
[15:35:24] <oksushi> gah, sorry (wrong channel :P )
[15:38:27] <io_____> ??
[15:41:26] <decx> io_____ do you do all that in your resize function`?
[15:41:51] <decx> if so dont
[15:43:23] <io_____> decx: a simplified version of the whole function http://codepad.org/zjeX8UPx
[16:07:31] <adv_> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function ,  $(document).ready(function() { $('.toggle').toggles();});
[16:07:37] <adv_> what am i doing wrong?
[16:07:53] <duch_kazatel> .toggles() isn't working.  do you mean .toggle()?
[16:09:26] <adv_> http://simontabor.com/labs/toggles/
[16:09:29] <adv_> duch_kazatel: it's from ^
[16:11:10] <adv_> or is there a better toggling ui plugin?
[16:12:15] <cjwelborn> adv_: probably a dumb question, but you have the toggles source included in your page right? <script src='whatever.js'></script>? Also, do you have devtools (chrome, firefox, ie) so you can check with the console?
[16:12:35] <karamazov> If I've got a $.get going to a file on someone else's server that is restricted, shouldn't passing in the username and password get me through?
[16:12:53] <adv_> yes cjwelborn
[16:14:34] <duch_kazatel> adv_ sorry on something else atm.  can you make a fiddle that replicates?  or show us the page it's breaking on?
[16:17:02] <psud3ity> Hey guys, have what I hope is a quick question.  I'm using this nifty little datepicker with the getDate method: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-getDate.  When I attempt to print the output of currentDate to console, I get an object, but I expected a date.  I've changed ".selector" to the name of the field I'm interested in, in this case "startDate", can anyone give me a hint here?
[16:17:14] <psud3ity> ".startDate" rather
[16:17:28] <Zak> psud3ity: is it a Date object?
[16:17:57] <psud3ity> startDate is the name of the html object that I have the datepicker hooked up to
[16:20:42] <psud3ity> Here's the whole mess, I'm admittedly new to javascript, so it's not pretty at all.  http://pastebin.com/XEDEYmbK
[16:23:28] <decx> does this seem reasonable http://jsfiddle.net/decx/pNzZz/ or am i off?
[16:42:57] <duch_kazatel> decx oooh.
[16:43:18] <duch_kazatel> you might want to debounce that one maybe?  otherwise it seems okay.
[16:44:26] <decx> probably in production, but the calculation itself should be negligible
[16:46:31] <duch_kazatel> that's fair. seems clean otherwise.
[16:49:48] <karamazov> I have to do a cross domain ajax call to a password protected file. Not sure if this task is legit or the client is trying to weed me out.
[16:52:19] <mdev> ajax doesn't support cross domain by default does it?
[16:52:21] <mdev> browsers that is
[16:52:56] <karamazov> By default they block it I believe
[16:58:13] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:58:31] <duch_kazatel> the remote server needs to allow it explicitly.
[17:05:41] <jro> is there anyway to get around the maxmimum number of concurrent ajax calls allowed at one time to a domain?
[17:18:10] <trewd> how can I find the next closest element with a certain id from $(this)
[17:21:43] <duch_kazatel> by selecting the ID since you can only have it on each page once.
[17:22:33] <trewd> i'm pre-loading a few modals on my page with the same user controls, so i'm having duplicate elements however with different parent modal ids
[17:23:14] <duch_kazatel> you're going to have problems if you have an ID repeated on a page - swap 'em out with classes instead.
[17:24:44] <trewd> if I'm referencing them like this, i won't have a problem: $("#AddUnitModal #tUnitDesc") $("#EditUnitModal #tUnitDesc")
[17:25:37] <duch_kazatel> i give up today.
[17:26:06] <Fall> Never gonna give you up.
[17:26:09] <Fall> Never gonna let you down.
[17:26:44] <trewd> are you Falling?
[17:28:08] <duch_kazatel> trewd why have multiples of the same ID on a given page if it's clearly invalid?  why not use classes at that point?
[17:29:41] <Fall> ;]
[17:30:43] <trewd> duch_kazatel: it's too late to go back
[17:30:50] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:31:31] <Fall> read only files?
[17:31:33] * Fall smirks
[17:32:01] <duch_kazatel> i just got done with a jquery upgrade from 1.8.3 to 1.11, corrected usage of .attr() vs .prop() and .data(), and dropped mootools out of another section of our codebase.
[17:32:42] <antlong> has anyone ever encountered a bug where you need to click an accordion header two times to collapse it?
[17:32:44] <duch_kazatel> so i guess whenever somebody says "it's too late to make my page valid" i kind of get confused.
[17:33:00] <duch_kazatel> antlong yes - when i'm putting my binding logic inside my event hanmdler.
[17:33:57] <antlong> whats the fix duch_kazatel?
[17:34:06] <duch_kazatel> turn the logic inside out.
[17:34:18] <duch_kazatel> and simplify it.
[17:35:01] <Fraz> anyone know how to make a draggable not wonky on an element inside a rotated parent?
[17:35:19] <Fraz> and also, when i rotate scaled elements they seem to act wierd
[17:35:27] <antlong> duch_kazatel i believe i know what the cause is, and unfortunately, I don't know of any fix
[17:36:06] <antlong> https://dpaste.de/mfEK
[17:36:16] <antlong> i think its because of the way i am attempting to reset the state
[17:36:26] <antlong> also, on blur doesn't work
[17:36:36] <antlong> is that a different event i should use?
[17:43:58] <Fraz> why does noone ever help me in here?
[17:44:02] <Fraz> I DEMAND HELPZ!
[17:44:17] <Zak> I demand world peace
[17:44:19] * Zak waits
[17:44:43] <Fraz> pffff, my help is more important than world peace:P
[17:45:21] <Fraz> and we all know world peice is inconceivable
[17:46:03] <Fraz> peice:S
[17:47:18] <decx> Fraz what's so wonky about it
[17:47:52] <Fraz> it jumps when you start dragging, and it doesnt move relative to where youre dragging
[17:48:16] <decx> do you transition an animation?
[17:49:25] <Fraz> oh yes theres 2 problems. im building a wysiwyg editor with a semi 3d enviroment. meaning you can rotate the window and drag an element around in it. thats the first problem
[17:50:03] <Fraz> within the editor you can scale and rotate. but when you play the transition, it deforms strangeley
[17:50:17] <decx> seems ok with the basic example http://jsfiddle.net/decx/9eYc5/
[17:50:35] <decx> you shouldnt transition: all but just transition: transform
[17:50:39] <Fraz> try rotating the parent of those elements
[17:50:43] <Fraz> then drag em around
[17:52:04] <Fraz> lol just rotating that example makes a mess
[17:52:23] <Fraz> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/9eYc5/
[17:52:58] <Fraz> see how the childredn are elongated and as you drag them they move strangely
[17:53:17] <Fraz> << firefox btw
[17:53:59] <Fraz> oops i didnt save it
[17:54:14] <Fraz> http://jsfiddle.net/9eYc5/2/
[17:55:38] <decx> hmm http://jsfiddle.net/decx/9eYc5/3/
[17:56:28] <Fraz> ah that looks much better. the draggable is still off though
[18:09:47] <w00tb3ast> Need some help using this: http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/#data-remote a
[18:10:18] <w00tb3ast> basically I have set it up the jquery is running fine but if I try specify a source or gallery option nothing happens, no errors
[18:10:37] <Fraz> so why isnt this working now?
[18:11:02] <Fraz> oh wait
[18:11:34] <w00tb3ast> code that I am trying is: http://jsfiddle.net/6685X/ will update with some html in a sec
[18:15:31] <Fraz> decx, are you still around?
[18:16:05] <Fraz> here is the initial problem with the scale http://jsfiddle.net/9eYc5/18/ however i fixed this (fiddle to follow)
[18:16:23] <w00tb3ast> Ok updated the code so that you can see how I am trying to define the call http://jsfiddle.net/6685X/1/
[18:19:20] <Fraz> decx, fixed dragging inside a scaled element http://jsfiddle.net/9eYc5/19/
[18:20:23] <Fraz> decx problem with rotated parent, http://jsfiddle.net/9eYc5/21/

[18:25:14] <antlong> is there a foolproof way to reset an accordion back to a default state?
[18:26:23] <Ansikt> antlong, What kind of accordion?
[18:26:25] <Ansikt> Tjat
[18:26:59] <Ansikt> That's a general design...it's like asking if there's a general way to reset a dropdown.
[18:27:03] <antlong> Ansikt a jqueryUI one
[18:27:36] <antlong> i'm talking about resetting the open/active headers
[18:29:05] <Ansikt> Ah. set opened to false

[18:29:17] <Ansikt> *'active' hate this keyboard
[18:31:33] <antlong> :) thanks, also, is there a more foolproof event to listen for than on blur?
[18:31:46] <antlong> it seems to not work
[18:32:41] <Ansikt> event for what?
[18:48:12] <w00tb3ast> Anyone out there care to tell me what is wrong with how I am using http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/#data-remote in this way: http://jsfiddle.net/6685X/2/
[19:29:33] <tw2113> does .text() strip out all html?
[19:32:23] <mvpgraff> no
[19:32:44] <mvpgraff> depending on your selector
[19:34:26] <tw2113> <h1 class="site-title page-title">AppPresser<span class="header-title-name"> | Just another WordPress site</span></h1>
[19:34:36] <tw2113> page load does some ajax loading
[19:34:58] <tw2113> gets replaced via titles.navtitle.text( newtitles.navtitle.text() );
[19:35:41] <tw2113> the span ends up stripped out
[19:35:45] <axscode> Hi guys, http://jsfiddle.net/hFDk2/ any help on this. please..
[19:36:33] <axscode> the third select field should have options that is  used in second select.
[19:38:21] <mvpgraff> tw2113 is better for that http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[19:38:47] <mvpgraff> You're just trying to replace the h1 content, not the span content correct?
[19:38:59] <tw2113> yes
[19:39:10] <tw2113> this is for a premium product and i'm debugging an issue a customer is having
[19:39:22] <tw2113> i found .html() works the expected way too
[19:39:56] <mvpgraff> yea, I would of said html too but I didn't know if it would work the way you wanted since it's wordpress :p
[19:42:57] <tw2113> it's just jquery

I want to hide friendslist when the person moves the mouse out of the friendslist and it's not going back to the LI. the friendslist hovers a little bit out of the li.
[19:58:25] <antlong> is it a bad idea to have 3 events, focusout, blur, and mouseleave all execute the same code?
[19:58:38] <antlong> the code is calling .accordion("refresh") if the input box of the filter is empty
