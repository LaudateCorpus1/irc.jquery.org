[00:19:00] <andrju> Hey guys, is it possible to listen to user clicking on 'back' button in browser? I have a problem with my options select when he does that and i figured out that event listener could solve it.
[00:22:34] <Cork> andrju: basically no
[00:22:49] <Cork> andrju: you can listen for unload or beforeunload
[00:22:55] <Cork> but it isn't supported in all browsers
[00:22:59] <andrju> Damn.
[00:23:06] <andrju> Because i have that weird problem which i cannot solve.
[00:23:13] <andrju> Maybe i will post what i am talking about.
[00:23:13] <Cork> andrju: what is the problem?
[00:23:48] <andrju> Cork: one second please.
[00:25:36] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[00:29:50] <andrju> Cork: this is basically it : http://screencast.com/t/7bQq9SXEaQSm . After choosing "April" i clicked back in browser and what happened - date's were alingned correctly to the previous month, but selec frield 'value' was still april which is confusing.
[00:30:58] <Cork> uh screencast?
[00:31:11] <andrju> Well sorry, but it was easiest way to show what's wrong.
[00:31:13] <andrju> 'visually'
[00:35:52] <znf> would jQuery have an issue with #selector_XX:YY:ZZ ?
[00:38:35] <andrju> Cork: so you get the idea? After clicking back button my option field doesn't refresh and that's what causes the problem :/
[00:38:46] <Cork> znf: i'm quite sure you would have to escape the : characters
[00:38:52] <znf> yup, found it
[00:38:53] <znf> thanks
[00:39:23] <Cork> andrju: i'm not watching a video about a website
[00:40:08] <andrju> I already tried to explain it using words, didn't i?
[00:40:22] <sacho> use code
[00:40:32] <sacho> make a test case and show your problem
[00:42:49] <andrju> When i select an option from a select which looks like that: https://gist.github.com/luseerr/a02fbd4db0946d2f1b5a and hit 'back' button in the browser "selected" argument changes fine, but select's label is not correct (the one from before clicking back)
[00:43:16] <Cork> andrju: set autocomplete="off" on the element
[00:44:47] <andrju> Cork: on select?
[00:44:50] <Cork> yes
[00:44:55] <andrju> Ok, checking it out.
[00:45:12] <Cork> the problem you get comes from the browser trying to restore the old select value
[00:45:16] <Cork> overriding the selected value
[00:47:11] <andrju> Cork: didn't help, same thing happens, I checked if it's turned off after hitting back button and it is.
[00:47:43] <Cork> andrju: then you need to provide runnable code for the problem
[00:47:47] <Cork> not just code dumps
[00:47:57] <Cork> make an example of the problem in jsfiddle.net
[00:48:25] <sammych> still waiting for the jQM 1.4.4 changelog ;)

[02:38:03] <mooncup> can I use .change() on a form?
[02:38:19] <Cork> mooncup: to do what?
[02:38:25] <Cork> (and to answer, no)
[02:38:31] <mooncup> ah fair enough
[02:38:38] <mooncup> I'll just give all the inputs a class then
[02:38:51] <mooncup> hm actually
[02:38:57] <mooncup> could I use #form > input
[02:39:04] <Cork> mooncup: or just do $('form')'on('change', ':input', func)
[02:39:21] <mooncup> yeah that should work
[02:39:33] <mooncup> cheers
[02:39:51] <Cork> also you might want to use 'input change' instead of just change
[02:40:13] <mooncup> what's the difference?
[02:40:33] <Cork> mooncup: input is similar to keydown except it fires after the value has been added
[02:40:38] <Cork> ?g mdn input event
[02:40:39] <b-ot> Cork: input - Event reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[02:40:56] <mooncup> cheers
[02:41:17] <mooncup> I feel like I should've known about that event sooner
[02:41:21] <mooncup> it looks very useful
[02:41:30] <Cork> ya, many don't
[02:41:46] <Cork> and many use keyup instead (or keydown)
[02:41:54] <mooncup> yeah I've been using keyup for some time now
[02:42:22] <mooncup> but I'm guessing I can bind this to all inputs, rather than needing different events for selects and text fields
[02:42:44] <Cork> the biggest problem with keyup is that it doesn't catch repeating keys
[02:42:56] <Cork> input does
[02:44:14] <mooncup> so it's on.('input change')?
[02:44:27] <Cork> on( not on.(
[02:44:30] <Cork> but the rest is correct
[02:45:32] <mooncup> yeah that was a typo
[02:45:33] <mooncup> thanks
[02:47:51] <sprihodko> Hi! I am using select2 and jQuery UI for sortable tags. All i need is to have number before each tag with tag index. Now i prepending it on page load, so when i add a new tag it is without number. Maybe select2 have some functionality for this? http://pastie.org/9555119
[03:36:30] <usc911> hey guys, could anyone point me in the right direction? this code grabs the url, cehcks if it contains '#comment' then grabs the number of the comment (e.g. #comment-88) then tries to get the previous div id https://gist.github.com/bmweeden/18b18d4ba97919cd15d3
[03:36:58] <usc911> but I getting 'undefined' returned if I try alert previousId
[03:37:36] <Cork> usc911: just use window.location.hash
[03:37:42] <Cork> no need to parse the url manually
[03:40:19] <usc911> Cork: I can get the current id, when the page loads, its the id of the previous div that I need
[03:40:42] <Cork> usc911: first make sure the hash variable is the correct value
[03:41:03] <Cork> if that is then try console.log($(hash).legnth)
[03:41:10] <Cork> to make sure you find the element
[03:43:09] <usc911> if I log that I get undefined
[03:43:22] <Woet> usc911: you corrected his typo right? it's .length, not .legnth
[03:43:28] <Cork> $(hash).legnth gives you undefined??
[03:43:31] <Cork> oh
[03:43:36] <Cork> lol
[03:52:36] <decx> that property tells you at which leg you are
[04:10:50] <mooncup> can anyone see an obvious reason why this wouldn't be getting triggered?
[04:10:51] <mooncup> $('#lead_create_form').on('input change', 'input.searchable', function() {
[04:11:06] <mooncup> I've got a form with id lead_create_form
[04:11:19] <mooncup> and I'm typing into a text field inside the form with class of input.searchable
[04:11:25] <mooncup> *class of searchable
[04:11:31] <Cork> and $('#lead_create_form').length > 0 just before the .on call?
[04:12:11] <mooncup> it's set to 1
[04:12:21] <mooncup> though there is more than 1 field in the form, so I don't know if that's right
[04:12:45] <Cork> mooncup: you can't have more then one element with the same id
[04:13:02] <mooncup> yeah I know
[04:13:02] <Cork> so that might be the source of your problem
[04:13:08] <mooncup> what?
[04:13:15] <Cork> ah number of fields
[04:13:20] <mooncup> ah sorry I was unclear
[04:13:25] <Cork> ya, that was a test to make sure the form existed
[04:13:52] <Cork> the input in the selector is most likely not needed
[04:13:59] <Cork> but ya it should work
[04:14:12] <mooncup> I had it without the input but it wouldn't work either
[04:14:17] <mooncup> no error or anything, just nothing happening
[04:14:30] <Cork> making the selector more specific won't make it match more :)
[04:14:46] <Cork> sounds like you might have invalid html
[04:14:49] <mooncup> yeah but I wasn't sure if the input event could only be triggered by "input only" selectors if you see what I mean
[04:14:51] <Cork> so the fields ends up outside the form
[04:15:00] <mooncup> tis possible, I'll have a proper look now
[04:15:41] <mooncup> nah chrome is grouping it inside the form when I expand elements inside the console
[04:15:56] <Cork> then it should work
[04:17:44] <mooncup> lemme change it to keyup, just to see if that works
[04:18:08] <mooncup> nope, tis definately the selector
[04:18:09] <mooncup> how odd
[04:18:34] <Cork> make a fiddle of the problem if you want help
[04:23:46] <mooncup> I'll have more of a play
[04:23:48] <mooncup> but it might come to that
[04:23:49] <mooncup> thanks
[04:24:40] <WhereIsMySpoon> Is there a way to transform elements to jQuery elements without using '$'?
[04:24:50] <WhereIsMySpoon> $ is mapped to prototype instead of js for us
[04:25:24] <Lebbe> use the global variable 'jQuery'
[04:25:33] <WhereIsMySpoon> Lebbe: then what? there is no jQuery.$
[04:25:42] <Lebbe> jQuery(element)
[04:25:45] <WhereIsMySpoon> aha
[04:26:04] <Lebbe> if you use an iife, you can do like this
[04:26:21] <Lebbe> (function($) { your code here!  })(jQuery);
[04:26:35] <WhereIsMySpoon> iife?
[04:26:35] <Lebbe> then you can use $ for jQuery (but not prototype)
[04:26:47] <Lebbe> google it
[04:27:03] <WhereIsMySpoon> ok then. thanks for your help!
[04:32:01] <PAGO> hey
[04:33:57] <PAGO> I have a question: Is it possible to connect 2 buttons. I mean you click one ode them and at the same time the other get the click-event too? just like an alias or something like that
[04:34:55] <gepetobio> try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3560227/jquery-javascript-trigger-button-click-from-another-button-click-event
[04:35:02] <Cork> PAGO: why would you duplicate the event?
[04:35:05] <Lebbe> it is possible, but why would you want to do it?
[04:35:12] <Cork> PAGO: just have one event handler for both
[04:35:34] <Lebbe> and if you do it for both buttons on each other, they will just continue for ever and ever and send each other click events
[04:35:58] <Cork> there is ways around that, but ya
[04:36:25] <Lebbe> why not have one function that runs when one button or the other is clicked
[04:36:35] <PAGO> well i am working with a funtion i didnt wrote my self. it uses an array. i cant use the function on the other buttons
[04:36:41] <Lebbe> $button1.add($button2).click(function)
[04:37:12] <Lebbe> $button1.add($button2).click(function() { /* call on weird third-party function here */})
[04:37:54] <PAGO> ok looks easy i am gonna try it, ty
[04:50:43] <usrb1n> Hello guys. I need your help with a little thing where I got stuckd. I have a page with several HTML tables (8 tables). None of them are identified by any ID or Name...not even class. The only way to identify my table is knowing that it's the third one on the page. Requesting the devs to change the page will take lot of time so I am looking for a solution
[04:50:52] <usrb1n> I tried to read on jquery selectors but can't reach my goal
[04:51:13] <usrb1n> What's the best way to get all table tags in the page and select the 3rd one ?
[04:51:37] <BinaryKitten> $('table').eq(2)
[04:52:07] <BinaryKitten> I think
[04:52:17] <sprihodko> Hello. I have current code if $('.collection').find('option:selected').text() ...code... If i have one collection on page it works as expected, but with two or more it not works. How can i check this if $('.collection').find('option:selected').text() for each collection? e.g If at least one collection does not have option:selected than do not run code
[04:53:23] <usrb1n> BinaryKitten: Testing that now, thank you !
[04:53:38] <BinaryKitten> usrb1n: you're welcome
[04:56:09] <BinaryKitten> sprihodko: two ticks. Can't type it out on mobile
[04:58:52] <BinaryKitten> sprihodko
[04:58:59] <BinaryKitten> you'll need to use .map
[04:59:24] <BinaryKitten> though i've not got the scrollback on here..
[05:00:47] <BinaryKitten> var selectedTexts = $('.selector option:selected').map(function() { return $(this).text(); }).get(); if ($('.selector').length < selectedTexts.length) { /* not selected all */ }
[05:03:30] <Cork> this sounds like a round about solution
[05:03:42] <Cork> why not just check if any of them isn't selected?
[05:04:37] <sprihodko> Cork: and how can i do it?
[05:04:39] <Cork> var collection = $('.collection'); collection.filter(function() { return $(this).val() == ''; }).length !== collection.length
[05:05:04] <Cork> or even simpler
[05:05:15] <Cork> $('.collection').filter(function() { return $(this).val() == ''; }).length > 0
[05:07:45] <sprihodko> Cork: Thank you! It works now, but i will try to test it more
[05:08:09] <jqff> im having issues with .animate backgroundColor
[05:08:27] <jqff> it works in jsfiddle as seen here http://jsfiddle.net/1sz1f2n0/8/  but somehow not in my app
[05:08:48] <jqff> left and opicity work but not backgroundColor
[05:08:52] <Cork> check that you have the same version of jquery
[05:09:17] <Cork> actually
[05:09:35] <Cork> i need to check this, but i'm quite sure only jquery ui enabled color animations
[05:10:08] <Cork> yup
[05:10:13] <Cork> "Note: The jQuery UI project extends the .animate() method by allowing some non-numeric styles such as colors to be animated. The project also includes mechanisms for specifying animations through CSS classes rather than individual attributes."
[05:10:38] <BinaryKitten> Cork yeah, i was trying to give them all the values, missed the bit where they only needed the chec
[05:10:51] <jqff> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/jquery-ui.min.js < this one
[05:10:57] <jqff> works in jsfiddle but not in my app
[05:16:10] <mooncup> lol Cork I went for lunch then got back and spotted it straight away
[05:16:16] <mooncup> I had it inside another selector >.<
[05:16:43] <Cork> food is good for the brain :D
[05:16:52] <jqff> cork
[05:16:57] <jqff> any other suggestions to my issue ?
[05:17:14] <Cork> not really
[05:18:05] <Cork> jqff: only tip i can give is try to reduce the page where it doesn't work
[05:18:22] <Cork> until you find what causes the difference
[05:19:38] <jqff> yep
[05:19:41] <jqff> thats what im doing
[05:31:17] <mjsey89> Hi all
[05:33:09] <mjsey89> I have written some jquery which makes an ajax call and populates a nested menu on click of each element and it updates accordingly . The problem I have is that if the page is refreshed the menu starts back at its inital state not open to its clicked state. Is there some sort of way to preserve the state of the menu on refresh?
[05:37:43] <Cork> mjsey89: you could make the page not reload
[05:37:54] <Cork> mjsey89: by loading the content you need with ajax
[05:38:12] <Cork> or you can send what menus was active in cookie, or similar solutions
[05:38:29] <Cork> (localstorage, indexeddb ...)
[05:41:00] <mjsey89> I see. Basically I run a function which will create a text file under the selected menu items path. I need the menu to reflect the newly created file which I can do by re-treversing through the menu
[05:41:07] <mjsey89> but not instantly
[05:44:57] <Cork> mjsey89: simplest is prob to go the ajax route then
[05:46:11] <mjsey89> so basically Id have to mimic the procedure of the ajax calls made by each click in order to update the menu?
[05:47:04] <Cork> mjsey89: well more like you ex. set a class on the links in the menu
[05:47:12] <Cork> and add an event handler to do the work with ajax
[05:47:29] <mjsey89> ahh i see
[05:47:36] <mjsey89> Im over complicating this for myself :p
[05:49:00] <Cork> something like $('.menu').on('click', 'a', function() { $.ajax(this.href).done(function(data){ $('#content').html(data.html); history.pushState({}, "", data.url); }); });
[05:49:46] <Cork> opps meant $.ajax(this.href, { dataType: 'json' }).done...
[05:51:04] <PAGO> $(".buttonalt1").click(function(){     $(".button1").click();  }); means when I click .buttonalt1, .button1 gets clicked too?
[05:51:30] <Cork> PAGO: kinda ya
[05:51:38] <Cork> though it fake creates a new event
[05:51:52] <Cork> and like we said before, you risk creating a loop
[05:52:58] <PAGO> ok it only creates the event but isnt true.
[05:53:14] <Cork> what?
[05:53:47] <neredsenvy> $("img[src='images/test.jpg']") why does this not find the element even tho it's called in $(document).ready(...) and that the element does actually exist in page ?
[05:54:10] <PAGO> in my newby words: it makes the click possible but ist set as clicked
[05:54:17] <PAGO> *isnt
[05:54:18] <Cork> neredsenvy: is the src attribute exactly images.test.jpg?
[05:54:32] <Cork> neredsenvy: as in the html beeing <img src="images/test.jpg">
[05:54:52] <Cork> images.test.jpg => images/test.jpg?
[05:55:01] <neredsenvy> Cork: <img class="lb-image" src="images/test.jpg" style="display: block; width: 621px; height: 891px;">
[05:55:19] <mjsey89> could I just used the trigger function to mimic the menu clicking:
[05:56:05] <Cork> neredsenvy: http://jsfiddle.net/66gaduv7/
[05:56:24] <Cork> mjsey89: .click() will fire a fake click event
[05:56:36] <PAGO> ok ty
[05:56:39] <Cork> mjsey89: though if the element you do this on is an <a> tag
[05:56:46] <Cork> and you want it to follow the link
[05:56:51] <Cork> you can't use .click()
[05:57:05] <mjsey89> what could  I use?
[05:57:12] <PAGO> no it triggers another function
[05:57:20] <Cork> mjsey89: you would have to grab the href from the link
[05:57:28] <Cork> and set it to window.location = target.href
[05:57:31] <neredsenvy> Cork: I know it should work but oddly it does not : P
[05:57:48] <Cork> neredsenvy: so something you arn't mentioning is causing the problem
[06:03:25] <neredsenvy> Cork: Is there a way to say find div whos first child is img[src="images/test.jpg"] ? Without doing $('img[src...).parent() ?
[06:03:58] <Cork> no
[06:04:11] <Cork> selectors can select on parents never children
[06:05:29] <sniperh4x0r> Is there a way to have an event listener break out from a currently running function
[06:05:42] <sniperh4x0r> im running animations and want to have a skip button on them
[06:05:46] <sniperh4x0r> this is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/fyxgy58x/1/
[06:06:04] <sniperh4x0r> im working with multiple elements so i dont know how to simply do a .stop
[06:06:50] <Cork> sniperh4x0r: animations isn't threaded so you can't breakout
[06:07:03] <Cork> $('neo_panel_0') <-- this misses the #
[06:07:10] <Cork> so that is prob why it doesn't work
[06:07:29] <Cork> also you can do $('#neo_panel_0, #neo_panel_1, #neo_panel_2, #neo_panel_3,').stop()
[06:07:55] <Cork> or simply give them a class and do $('.class_name').stop()
[06:11:19] <sniperh4x0r> actually they are fadein's not animations if that matters
[06:11:30] <sniperh4x0r> and .stop() doesnt seem to work..
[06:11:36] <Cork> it doesn't
[06:11:37] <sniperh4x0r> at least the way im implementing it
[06:11:44] <Cork> fadein is just a shorthand for animate
[06:11:50] <sniperh4x0r> ah okay
[06:11:51] <sniperh4x0r> hmm
[06:11:59] <sniperh4x0r> so is there any way i can implement a skip button?
[06:12:33] <Cork> sniperh4x0r: what exist is the .stop() call
[06:12:41] <Cork> and it should stop the animations
[06:12:54] <Cork> if it doesn't, and you can't figure out why
[06:12:57] <sniperh4x0r> Cork: I'm not chaining the animations
[06:12:59] <Cork> make a demo of the problem in jsfiddle
[06:13:11] <sniperh4x0r> ok
[06:13:24] <Cork> ah
[06:13:39] <Cork> ya, stop won't help with all those setTimeouts
[06:13:47] <Cork> you REALLY shouldn't use those
[06:22:05] <effortDee> what version does .on() work with??
[06:22:31] <Cork> 1.8+
[06:22:55] <Cork> (it is listed in the api.jquery.com if you care to look)
[06:23:12] <Cork> opps off by one
[06:23:20] <Cork> 1.7 not 1.8
[06:23:20] <effortDee> i checked
[06:23:24] <effortDee> thanks
[06:23:26] <effortDee> i thought it was
[06:23:28] <effortDee> just double checking
[06:23:35] <Cork> then why did you need to ask?
[06:23:46] <effortDee> website im using only has 1.6.1
[06:23:47] <Cork> "version added: 1.7"
[06:23:52] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:24:39] <effortDee> Cork++
[06:24:42] <effortDee> thank you kindly sir
[06:25:36] <fRAiLtY-> Cork, what do you do for a day job?
[06:25:46] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: coding
[06:25:49] <effortDee> lol
[06:25:56] <fRAiLtY-> freelance?
[06:26:01] <Cork> no
[06:27:08] <sniperh4x0r> so here is my animation that i want to skip: http://jsfiddle.net/fyxgy58x/2/
[06:27:16] <sniperh4x0r> anyone think they can get the skip button to go straight to blue?
[06:27:29] <Cork> sniperh4x0r: no
[06:27:37] <Cork> like i said you have a tone of setTimeouts in there
[06:27:40] <effortDee> what do you mean skip b utton go to blue?
[06:27:45] <Cork> and that will make the job really hard
[06:27:50] <effortDee> just use css transition
[06:27:54] <effortDee> same result
[06:27:57] <effortDee> simpler
[06:28:17] <Cork> well not transition
[06:28:24] <Cork> but @keyframe
[06:29:01] <effortDee> indeed
[06:29:09] <effortDee> but that is for another channel ;)
[06:29:18] <sniperh4x0r> effortDee: i mean the blue background that is at the end of the animation
[06:29:26] <effortDee> yer just use css
[06:29:43] <sniperh4x0r> effortDee: would the css approach allow for a skip button?
[06:32:56] <sniperh4x0r> if i dont use settimeouts
[06:33:03] <sniperh4x0r> would a .stop be possible?
[06:47:05] <Cork> sniperh4x0r: yes
[06:47:18] <Cork> jquery builds queues, and .stop clears that queue
[06:47:25] <Cork> you basically build your own queue
[06:47:40] <Cork> but without mechanics to abort it
[06:51:57] <Juc1> hi all, newbie question please - my slideshow text http://200.click-monkey.net uses fade in / fade out and I want to change (slow) the speed of the fades - should I be able to identify the file controlling fade speed in DOM inspector etc?
[06:53:13] <Cork> Juc1: no
[06:53:18] <Cork> the animation is js not html
[06:53:23] <Cork> so you won't find it in the dom
[06:53:54] <Cork> you would have to check the plugin to see if there is an option to control its speed
[06:54:51] <Juc1> Cork: ok thanks but I was thinking it must have at least one speed = the default speed so I thought maybe I could change that?
[06:55:31] <Cork> Juc1: sure, but how that is done depends on the plugin
[06:57:11] <Juc1> Cork: in the slideshow user interface there is no option to change the speed so I thought that maybe the speed was just hard wired somewhere
[06:57:31] <Juc1> so I thought I could find it for example 400 ms and then change it in the file
[07:02:37] <Juc1> Cork: or do you mean that there might be no speed at all defined in the plugin ?
[07:18:17] <Cork> Juc1: can't tell i don't know the plugin
[07:18:39] <Cork> but as js animations has to be built around timers or requestAnimation frame one way or another
[07:18:47] <Cork> there has to be some form of values
[07:18:55] <Cork> what that value is depends on the plugin though
[07:32:02] <sniperh4x0r> i have a loop going from 0 to 3 and in that loop i want to pass 4 different elements to a function. what is the syntax that i would need to make my i take over part of the element name? i have something like animateSlide(.neo_panel_[i]);
[07:32:17] <sniperh4x0r> obviously you cant have something like neo_panel_[i] thought
[07:34:47] <sniperh4x0r> doesn't it need to be something like neo_slide_.[i].
[07:34:55] <sniperh4x0r> i dont really know the syntax
[07:37:19] <Nomikos> no, neo_slide_[i] is correct
[07:38:02] <Nomikos> where neo_slide_ is an object (or array) and i is a variable holding the key (or integer for array)
[07:38:27] <sniperh4x0r> thanks
[07:38:38] <Nomikos> if i = 'foobar', neo_slide_[i] would be the same as neo_slide_.foobar
[07:39:25] <Nomikos> you can also use the square bracket syntax if the key string has spaces or other icky characters: neo_slide_['foo bar']
[07:51:09] <Juc1> Cork: ok thanks for your help
[07:51:49] <sniperh4x0r> how do i get an object in my jquery selector?
[07:52:28] <sniperh4x0r> say i have i="#foo"; and i want it to be $("i").
[07:52:42] <sniperh4x0r> i need to wrap the object in quotes
[07:53:36] <Cork> sniperh4x0r: $(i)
[07:53:42] <Cork> that isn't an object
[07:53:47] <Cork> it's a string variable
[07:55:05] <sniperh4x0r> right well if i put my string variable in there
[07:55:10] <sniperh4x0r> the string variable doesnt have quotes
[07:55:19] <sniperh4x0r> so it is simply doing $(#foo)
[07:55:29] <sniperh4x0r> which doesn't work..
[07:58:22] <sniperh4x0r> i wrapped it in quotes doing i = "'"+i+"'";
[07:58:40] <sniperh4x0r> then the string is '#foo'
[07:58:50] <Technodrome> is it possible to “freeze” a block of html , then go to another page, then go back to that page, and have it reshow that block of html?
[07:58:50] <tandroid> sniperh4x0r: That's not what it's doing.  $(i) is equal to $("#foo")
[07:58:53] <sniperh4x0r> but when i do $(i) it still doesnt select
[07:59:05] <Technodrome> since that original block is created with JS , that i was thinking it would be like a small trick or something
[08:00:03] <tandroid> sniperh4x0r: do a console.log(i) and see what you get.
[08:00:12] <tandroid> If it's not selecting there is something else wrong.
[08:00:40] <tandroid> and also make sure that the #foo element exists when the script is being called.
[08:01:51] <sniperh4x0r> the console log says #foo
[08:02:12] <sniperh4x0r> the element does exist i have the element fade in
[08:02:23] <sniperh4x0r> when i do $('#foo') it works
[08:02:29] <sniperh4x0r> but when i do $(i) it doesnt
[08:02:38] <sniperh4x0r> even though i is equivalent to the string #foo
[08:04:09] <sniperh4x0r> are you sure i dont have to do something like $(".i.")
[08:04:43] <tandroid> sniperh4x0r: http://jsfiddle.net/3L03h45t/
[08:05:19] <BillCriswell> sniperh4x0r: That can't be right.
[08:05:35] <tandroid> sniperh4x0r: I'm sure
[08:05:43] <tandroid> look at my example, That's all that you need to do.
[08:11:19] <BillCriswell> How do you all feel about mailto: links?
[08:11:38] <tandroid> It's asking for spam
[08:12:03] <tandroid> But you can make it a little better with some js.
[08:12:25] <BillCriswell> tandroid: All that aside. I'm talking from a real users experience with them.
[08:12:33] <tandroid> Ah, I don't like it.
[08:12:51] <tandroid> It always pulls up the mail app for me on mac and I don't use that, I use gmail.
[08:12:53] <jphase> no it's not actually, just use them correctly:   http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/antispambot
[08:13:09] <jphase> (in regards to asking for spam)
[08:13:45] <tandroid> jphase: that's great for wp, but what does that actually do?
[08:13:58] <tandroid> like behind the scenes so we can implement it elsewhere?
[08:14:00] <BillCriswell> tandroid: That's how I feel about them. The experience isn't consistent across browsers. A form with an option to use a mailto link is what I'm recommending.
[08:14:14] <jphase> encode your email address:  http://wpseek.com/antispambot/
[08:14:31] <tandroid> thanks jphase
[08:14:48] <jphase> it's pretty simple stuff, and granted, a bot could easily decode using the inverse of this function, but 99% of them wouldn't unless the programmer of the bot was targeting this function specifically
[08:16:05] <jphase> oh my bad btw folks, thought i was in another channel lol
[08:16:53] <tandroid> jphase: still good info for any web dev
[08:30:10] <sniperh4x0r> whats the proper way to write this? animateFoo('#foo_[i]');
[08:30:25] <sniperh4x0r> where i is a counter from 0 to 1
[08:30:33] <sniperh4x0r> inside of a loop
[08:31:17] <BillCriswell> sniperh4x0r: You should use a class name instead of a counter on id.
[08:31:17] <tandroid> animateFoo('#foo[" + i + "]");
[08:31:19] <tandroid> i guess?
[08:31:29] <jordonbiondo> is there a way to simplify ".classA.classB, .classA.classC"?
[08:31:30] <tandroid> Yeah definitely
[08:31:53] <erisco> cannot set property 'touchstart' of undefined.. this is coming from jquery mobile. has anyone seen this?
[08:32:08] <BillCriswell> jordonbiondo: .classB,.classC
[08:32:13] <Kartagis> hi
[08:32:30] <jordonbiondo> BillCriswell: yes, but class A must be specified as a parent
[08:32:52] <BillCriswell> That's not a parent selector.
[08:33:05] <Kartagis> do we target the input with the id like 'input['#id']' ?
[08:33:18] <BillCriswell> jordonbiondo: .classA .classB would be that. You're currently looking for class="classA classB"
[08:33:19] <Kartagis> specific input*
[08:33:28] <jordonbiondo> BillCriswell: I'm sorry there should be a space between those. ".classA .classB, .classA .classB"
[08:33:33] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: No, just $('#id')
[08:36:17] <BillCriswell> jordonbiondo:  You can do $('.a').find('.b,.c')
[08:37:53] <BillCriswell> I imagine just $('.a .c, .a .b') would be quicker since it would just be one go to querySelectorAll
[08:38:22] <sniperh4x0r> BillCriswell: can you specify what you mean?
[08:38:40] <sniperh4x0r> tandroid: animateFoo('#foo[" + i + "]"); doesn't seem to do the trick
[08:39:26] <BillCriswell> sniperh4x0r: Instead of <div id="foo_1"> <div id="foo_2"> just do <div class="foo"> <div class="foo"> and animateFoo($('.foo')); should work (depending n how animateFoo() is set up..
[08:40:12] <Mateo__> Hi everyone !
[08:41:13] <RyanTG> Mateo__: User everyone not found. Perhaps you meant, "Hello, .*"
[08:42:09] <Mateo__> I have a form, based on multiple pages (a previous work…) that i’d like to transform into a multiple steps form. Until that point, not a problem. Now, what I’d like to do, is taking care of the “back” button, of the browser. Any know a good way to handle it on browsers ? Including IE7 ? Thanks !
[08:42:28] <RyanTG> For as long as I took coming up with that smart-assed reply, you'd think I would have realized he wrote "hi" and not "hello".
[08:43:14] <RyanTG> Ah, yes, the web designer's worst enemy... The unstoppable back button.
[08:44:51] <RyanTG> We need one of those one-page web site... canistopthebackbutton.com  ... <html><head><title>Can I stop people clicking the back button on their browser?</title></head><body>No.</body></html>
[08:47:03] <BillCriswell> Mateo__: You can check out this answer. It seems promising: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1078501/keeping-history-of-hash-anchor-changes-in-javascript
[08:47:15] <Mateo__> RyanTG: Yep, this button should be removed from every browsers :)
[08:47:26] <jordonbiondo> BillCriswell: thanks, I'm not too worried about the speed so I'll go for the find approach
[08:47:45] <BillCriswell> The most used button in this history of the web browser should be removed? haha
[08:47:52] <BillCriswell> jordonbiondo: Okie doke.
[08:52:00] <tandroid> yeah sniperh4x0r, do what BillCriswell said. there is no need to do what you're trying to do.
[08:54:12] <Mateo__> BillCriswell: I will take a look thanks
[08:55:15] <Kartagis> what does function($) mean? run when document is ready?
[08:55:16] <sniperh4x0r> tandroid: BillCriswell thanks for the help
[08:55:24] <sniperh4x0r> i think i need to do it the way i am currently though
[08:55:30] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:55:32] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis you mean like (function($){})(); ?
[08:55:43] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: yep
[08:55:50] <robertmaxrees> that creates a new scope, Kartagis
[08:56:04] <Kartagis> meaning?
[08:56:16] <robertmaxrees> reduces variable collisions and stuff.
[08:56:23] <robertmaxrees> so your vars don't interfere with overs.
[08:56:27] <robertmaxrees> and vice versa.
[08:56:29] <Kartagis> hrm
[08:56:37] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/ is a good primer.
[08:56:45] <robertmaxrees> that's also protecting the $ variable.
[08:56:50] <Kartagis> and what is the (jQuery) at the end?
[08:56:51] <tandroid> sniperh4x0r: what are you trying to do. I can't when you would need to do that.
[08:57:04] <Kartagis> http://cgit.drupalcode.org/hierarchical_select/tree/hierarchical_select_formtoarray.js?id=b3e34d9#n94
[08:57:08] <sniperh4x0r> i'm trying to crossfade in between slides
[08:57:11] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis that's so you can use $ in noconflict mode.
[08:57:26] <sniperh4x0r> so i need each slide to have its own id
[08:57:35] <sniperh4x0r> basically fadein slide 1
[08:57:37] <sniperh4x0r> fade in slide 2
[08:57:38] <sniperh4x0r> etc
[08:58:08] <tandroid> Look at jquery's eq() and index() methods.
[08:59:04] <tandroid> And if you really need unique id's you should be doing that in the markup manually or with a server side language.
[08:59:22] <tandroid> and even then, I would use classes.
[09:19:37] <goosfraba> Can someone please tell me why this loop does'nt work? http://pastebin.com/xuHcMMMZ This is suppose to happen when page loads: officeURL is a declared variable that returns an array, I want to loop through it and print all the offices in my div id #officeList
[09:26:53] <Led_Zeppelin> <canvas id="ball" width="500" height="500"></canvas> is it possible to pass another variable to my <script> ?
[09:29:46] <lundy> heya folks im using jquery mobile to do this 	  <a href="priority.php?RID=1&new=1" data-role="button" data-icon="arrow-d" data-iconpos="notext" data-theme="a" data-inline="true">Down</a>
[09:29:46] <lundy> 		
[09:30:25] <lundy> but when it goes to priority.php iv got <?php header("location: index.php"); ?> which doesnt redirect back to index it just shows it :/
[09:49:30] <prettiestPony11> all of my selectors are returning null today and i have no idea why! le sigh..
[09:51:12] <robertmaxrees> sucks.
[09:51:15] <robertmaxrees> wait "null"?
[09:51:26] <robertmaxrees> that means jquery isn't loading properly.
[09:56:00] <tandroid> wouldn't it be "$ is undefined" if jquery wasn't loading properly?
[09:56:05] <tandroid> or something along those lines
[09:56:12] <robertmaxrees> totally depends.
[09:56:21] <tandroid> I see
[09:56:44] <robertmaxrees> if you're trying to select from the console and you're in chrome, $ is a shortcut from querySelectorAll if you don't have jquery loaded on the page.
[10:00:29] <goosfraba> Can someone please tell me why this loop does'nt work? http://pastebin.com/xuHcMMMZ This is suppose to happen when page loads: officeURL is a declared variable that returns an array, I want to loop through it and print all the offices in my div id #officeList
[10:00:57] <goosfraba> i debugged it using alert() and it get stuck at the if-statement
[10:01:36] <NoiseEee> goosfraba: maybe your data object doesn't have a 'status' key?
[10:01:59] <goosfraba> NoiseEee: yea it does, it have both status and result
[10:02:18] <NoiseEee> well what does "get stuck at the if-statement" mean goosfraba?
[10:02:49] <NoiseEee> does whatever address "officeUrl" is obey same-origin-policy?
[10:03:09] <goosfraba> that if i put alert("works"); on line 3 it doesnt show, but it does if i put it above the if statement
[10:03:30] <goosfraba> yes, i use same url to mark a google map
[10:03:39] <goosfraba> and on that function i also use the same if statement
[10:03:46] <NoiseEee> maybe pastebin whatever "data" is
[10:03:55] <NoiseEee> is data.result an array?
[10:03:55] <goosfraba> but now i want to list all the offices on the webpage
[10:04:09] <goosfraba> yes
[10:04:32] <NoiseEee> goosfraba: is your real question "why do i have the same office listed for the entire length"?
[10:04:45] <NoiseEee> ie: 15 offices = 15 markers that are the same address?
[10:05:29] <goosfraba> there's 6 offices in total, the marks on the map is correct, offices are in different countries
[10:05:51] <goosfraba> all i wanna do is to list them all to the side of the map
[10:06:09] <goosfraba> and sorry if i'm bad at explaining, pretty new to js and jquery
[10:06:32] <NoiseEee> i'd pastebin 'data' perhaps, or make your question a little clearer, and most certainly visit http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 to learn a bit more about effective debugging
[10:09:00] <Fishy> Do selectors affect new elements on page or just the elements at the time the code ran?
[10:09:12] <robertmaxrees> Fishy whenever they were run.
[10:09:30] <robertmaxrees> if you add something after the page loads and run a selector, it'll find it.
[10:09:37] <robertmaxrees> if you're caching things, however, that won't work.
[10:09:45] <goosfraba> NoiseEee: can i q you?
[10:10:01] <robertmaxrees> like var $myDivs = $('div'); won't update automatically.
[10:13:20] <hcker2000> any one had any luck reading exif data from images? I tried https://github.com/jseidelin/exif-js/blob/master/example/index.html but that always returns 6 for the orientation
[10:15:18] <decx> i think that's still a mess clientside
[10:15:38] <decx> but serverside should have plenty of options for any language
[10:25:44] <Cork> hcker2000: js has to resort to manually parsing the binary data of the image
[10:25:54] <Cork> as there is no api to access this data
[10:26:06] <Cork> though there should be a few libs out there to help with this
[10:30:09] <Cork> hcker2000: have you tried http://blueimp.github.io/JavaScript-Load-Image/ ?
[10:30:31] <Cork> i don't think i have a device that actually rotates the image that way so can't test
[10:32:18] <Cork> ah nice https://github.com/recurser/exif-orientation-examples
[10:36:50] <NoiseEee> goosfraba: better to do it in channel where others can help/learn etc
[10:37:18] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee++
[10:50:39] <litropy> How do I select the html5 tag <footer> ?
[10:50:52] <robertmaxrees> $('footer')
[10:50:55] <robertmaxrees> like any other tag.
[10:50:59] <Jattenalle> litropy, $('footer')
[10:51:53] <litropy> thx Jattenalle
[10:52:07] <Jattenalle> robertmaxrees was quicker than me, thank him :3
[10:52:11] <robertmaxrees> Jattenalle hahaha
[10:52:32] <benlieb> I made a simple slider like this:         context.$cont.animate({ scrollLeft: $(slide).position().left }) which just loops through the child elements. It works great except the sliding "overshoots" it's position, and then backs back up to the "right" position, like a slow bounce.
[10:52:46] <benlieb> I've tried various easing types and they all seem to do this. What's going on?
[10:54:25] <litropy> thx robertmaxrees
[10:54:31] <litropy> :P
[11:01:44] <benlieb> Don't know if my last message got through... got kicked off
[11:01:46] <benlieb> I made a simple slider like this:         context.$cont.animate({ scrollLeft: $(slide).position().left }) which just loops through the child elements. It works great except the sliding "overshoots" it's position, and then backs back up to the "right" position, like a slow bounce.
[11:02:01] <robertmaxrees> benlieb that doesn't really help us much - can you setup a sample fiddle?
[11:02:10] <benlieb> anyone know what's going on and how to stop it? It happens even with 'linear'...
[11:02:14] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: ok
[11:15:54] <benlieb> robertmaxrees:  a fiddle is proving harder than I thought
[11:17:50] <robertmaxrees> why's that?
[11:20:26] <benlieb> lot's of css and html involved, and the css is in sass. etc. Tried to make a fiddle but first I made a video... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZCEHklDjmc&feature=youtu.be
[11:20:41] <benlieb> not first, last
[11:20:43] <robertmaxrees> you know jsfiddle supports sass, right?
[11:20:54] <benlieb> nice to know
[11:21:07] <robertmaxrees> but you shouldn't need that much css and markup.
[11:21:14] <robertmaxrees> just enough to replicate.
[11:21:31] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: this is the js
[11:21:32] <benlieb> https://gist.github.com/pixelterra/1e07c4c19d608d593449
[11:21:40] <benlieb> I'll try later, but I have to run soon.
[11:21:57] <benlieb> anything obvious come to mind after the seeing the video?
[11:22:03] <robertmaxrees> why do you cache this in context and then not using it btw?
[11:23:15] <benlieb> i use the context in the callbacks
[11:25:21] <robertmaxrees> you're also missing some var declarations, but nothing is jumping out at me, except you're calling slide repeatedly
[11:25:40] <robertmaxrees> those timeouts might be biting you.
[11:26:38] <robertmaxrees> you're calling slide when you call slide haha
[11:29:49] <MythIncdragon> is this valid syntax?  >>  $(".bobbtn" ).$( "form input:text" ).remove();
[11:30:30] <MythIncdragon> form has a class of bobbtn and I want to remove all the input type of text
[11:31:09] <NoiseEee> no MythIncdragon
[11:31:24] <MythIncdragon> Ok, where is my mistake?
[11:31:26] <robertmaxrees> MythIncdragon you want to use a filter or .is()
[11:31:34] <NoiseEee> or a better selector
[11:31:39] <robertmaxrees> oh you want .find()
[11:31:53] <robertmaxrees> $('.bobbtn input:text') will do that, too.
[11:31:55] <NoiseEee> $('form.bobbtn input:text') should do
[11:32:13] <robertmaxrees> using what you're doing, $('.bobbtn').find('input:text') will work, too.
[11:32:38] <MythIncdragon> so $('.bobbtn').find('input:text').remove();
[11:32:41] <robertmaxrees> or $('input:text', '.bobbtn') <- this is a shortcut for using .find() the way I did earlier.
[11:32:53] <robertmaxrees> MythIncdragon sure, or the way NoiseEee just did it.  lots of ways.
[11:40:49] <ciqsteve> q:  I have a mouseenter event that only triggers on click (desktop chrome - latest)
[11:40:54] <ciqsteve> any ideas what would cause this?
[11:41:29] <MythIncdragon> do I put that jquery in $document.ready?
[11:42:00] <MythIncdragon> because it's not removing the <input>
[11:43:56] <NoiseEee> MythIncdragon: sure
[11:51:45] <MythIncdragon> is there a better place to put it?
[11:51:56] <NoiseEee> MythIncdragon: well when do you want them to be removed?
[11:52:49] <MythIncdragon> as soon as possible
[11:53:05] <robertmaxrees> either put your js before </body>, or put it in a doc ready.
[11:56:44] <MythIncdragon> There we go :)
[11:57:09] <MythIncdragon> I just put the script block, just under the <form> tag ;)
[11:57:18] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[11:57:30] <robertmaxrees> put it in the head within a document ready, or right before the closing body tag.
[12:01:06] <MythIncdragon> This is on a joomla site, so I don't know where the <input type=text is being inserted in the first place.
[12:06:17] <robertmaxrees> that's why a doc ready is generally your safest bet.
[12:06:25] <robertmaxrees> the backend doesn't matter as far as the js is concerned.
[12:25:35] <ZeroBeholder> awww... my ajax is redirecting.
[12:26:02] <ZeroBeholder> http://jsfiddle.net/k1mkh31h/
[12:26:15] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[12:26:20] <robertmaxrees> you need to fix that on your server.
[12:26:26] <ZeroBeholder> How?
[12:26:40] <robertmaxrees> by looking at your redirects.
[12:26:44] <robertmaxrees> your server manages redirects.
[12:27:00] <robertmaxrees> also, use .done() instead of success.
[12:27:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/k1mkh31h/1/ like this.
[12:27:31] <ZeroBeholder> I don't have any. Redirects set up on the server, brand new. Just my screw ups on there.
[12:27:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:28:00] <robertmaxrees> your frontend code will not do any redirects.
[12:28:23] <ZeroBeholder> Sorry, poor choice of words and the worst punctuation I've ever written.
[12:28:59] <robertmaxrees> i think i know what you meant - you don't think there are any redirects setup on the server since you just set it up.
[12:29:24] <ZeroBeholder> I get my one line of text on the target of the ajax request with the location in the browser changed. And yes, it was just me on the box and I don't have any official redirects.
[12:29:34] <ZeroBeholder> I will try it with the done...
[12:29:59] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[12:30:04] <robertmaxrees> the done() won't fix anything.
[12:30:34] <robertmaxrees> by redirect do you mean the URL of the page is changing?
[12:31:53] <robertmaxrees> beause if that's the case, THIS is what you need -> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k1mkh31h/2/
[12:32:33] <ZeroBeholder> Yes. That is probably what is tripping me up.
[12:32:53] <robertmaxrees> bind to the submit event of the form and run preventDefault() against the event object.
[12:34:13] <ZeroBeholder> I've been out of the game for about two years, when did the functionality change?
[12:34:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[12:34:30] <robertmaxrees> never.
[12:35:50] <ZeroBeholder> In that case, I have always been doing it wrong and got lucky that it worked.
[12:36:21] <ZeroBeholder> I started with an old cut & paste from my last paying gig.
[12:37:07] <sniperh4x0r> if i have a function and a settimeout in that function that hides a div is it possible to break out from that timeout with a on click event listener?
[12:37:08] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you can do it with click events and preventDefault on those instead
[12:37:20] <robertmaxrees> but it's more semantically accurate to do it on the submit event.
[12:38:51] <sniperh4x0r> my code looks like this: function foo(){  //settimeout to hide div        $('.skip_div').on('click', function() {  //break out and prevent stop the time out });
[12:39:02] <sniperh4x0r> althought i dont know how to break out and prevent the stop
[12:39:14] <sniperh4x0r> i tried simply returning to break out of the function
[12:39:19] <sniperh4x0r> doesn't work though
[12:39:20] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ sniperh4x0r
[12:39:20] <b-ot> sniperh4x0r: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:39:36] <ZeroBeholder> robertmaxrees: Hey, that part works. Thanks. Now to figure out why the welcome string is busted in my PHP.
[12:40:14] <robertmaxrees> awesome. glad i could help.
[12:50:13] <drakythe> if I’m using .attr(‘class’) to get all the classes associated with an element, how would I eliminate all but one of the classes? I have a class that varies based on html element but it has a common piece to it that I can filter off of.
[13:19:59] <__joshua____> sure
[13:30:54] <Erendrake> Sortable question: I have some connected with lists that are nested inside of a larger sortable. I am listening to the receive event and it fires normally but if i change an attribute on the item the update doesnt appear
[13:31:04] <Erendrake> it works fine for the change event.
[13:31:55] <Erendrake> I would like to be able to tell the difference between the two actions
[14:04:44] <tinkiete> hello
[14:05:25] <robertmaxrees> hola
[14:07:31] <tinkiete> i cant display the list from auto-complete the results doesnt display ,this is my code http://pastebin.com/Kf93ptLZ
[14:08:52] <Kartagis> var d=new Date(jQuery('#edit-field-opening-date-und-0-value-datepicker-popup-0').val()).toJSON().substring(0,10) why is this giving me the day before .val() ?
[14:09:07] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete that .data() call happens before the ajax returns.
[14:09:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to put all your logic inside of the success call.
[14:13:41] <tinkiete> robertmaxrees: i dont get u well
[14:14:26] <tinkiete> robertmaxrees: which data re u talking about
[14:14:30] <robertmaxrees> line 29.
[14:14:40] <robertmaxrees> the call to .data()
[14:14:49] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't wait for the ajax to return.
[14:15:18] <jqff> hi im using .animate color  background-color is working but not color
[14:19:32] <tinkiete> robertmaxrees: i did like u said but it changes nothing http://pastebin.com/PWDftRKH
[14:20:00] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete err... it's more complicated than that...
[14:21:21] <Kartagis> var d=new Date(jQuery('#edit-field-opening-date-und-0-value-datepicker-popup-0').val()).toJSON().substring(0,10) why is this giving me the day before .val() ?
[14:21:48] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete you want something closer to this: http://fixee.org/paste/uzw4xmq/
[14:22:24] <jqff> hi im using .animate color  background-color is working but not color
[14:22:45] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis what is .val() ?
[14:23:28] <robertmaxrees> jqff you need to include an extra plugin or use jquery ui
[14:23:34] <tinkiete> robertmaxrees: it doesnt work
[14:23:39] <tinkiete> nothing is display
[14:23:41] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete any console errors?
[14:23:50] <tinkiete> i got no errors

[14:26:24] <tinkiete> when i checked the console, i got some  the  info i wanted but it cant be displayed
[14:26:24] <robertmaxrees> going an extra step: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s9ebm5ws/1/
[14:27:08] <benlieb> is there a shorthand for this: $($('selector')[ 0 ])
[14:27:33] <robertmaxrees> benlieb use .eq(0)
[14:27:39] <robertmaxrees> $('selector').eq(0)
[14:28:26] <jakey> you can always do $('selector:first-child') too
[14:28:35] <jqff> robertmaxrees like i said background-color is working but not color what can be the problem ?
[14:28:36] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: tnx
[14:28:55] <robertmaxrees> jqff do you have jquery ui included?
[14:29:03] <jqff> yes
[14:29:08] <jqff> also jquery-color
[14:29:13] <robertmaxrees> okay, then no clue without seeing your code.
[14:29:23] <jqff> it works in jsfidler..
[14:29:31] <robertmaxrees> any console errors on your side?

[14:35:41] <benlieb> position() seems to not be it

[14:38:54] <Dukuo> Hey! Anyone online?
[14:39:48] <Woet> Dukuo: nope, this channel is deserted.
[14:39:55] <Dukuo> *sigh*
[14:39:56] <Dukuo> so I'm making a small website using Handlebars and jQuery for loading 'modules' or template partials but it seems that the ajax calls are out of order, you should see a header, a slider, a text and then a footer container... but sometimes it goes wrong! http://104.131.42.31/~elcobre/
[14:40:17] <Dukuo> I'm using promises but it's not working at all
[14:40:22] <robertmaxrees> back
[14:41:31] <robertmaxrees> benlieb .position() was made to do that - "The .position() method allows us to retrieve the current position of an element relative to the offset parent."
[14:42:02] <Dukuo> any ideas guys ?
[14:42:05] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: when I use position(), and then manually scroll the parent, the position() value of the child is different.
[14:42:14] <benlieb> if it were relative, it would always be the same.
[14:42:19] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: ^
[14:42:54] <benlieb> I want the position relative to the parent top or side even if it's out of view
[14:42:56] <robertmaxrees> Dukuo no clue - my guess is you need to give the three elements specific targets instead.
[14:43:29] <Dukuo> robertmaxrees could it be that some ajax calls load faster than others, resulting in reaching faster to the DOM ?
[14:43:31] <robertmaxrees> benlieb then you need to get the offset of the parent, the offset of the child, and calculate it yourself.
[14:43:44] <robertmaxrees> Dukuo ... yeah.  ajax is async by nature.
[14:43:58] <Dukuo> robertmaxrees any fix for that ? using promises is not solving the issue
[14:44:10] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: what exactly is the offset? The distance away from the viewable edge?
[14:44:20] <robertmaxrees> benlieb the docs explain it pretty well.
[14:44:44] <robertmaxrees> Dukuo promises isn't necessarily about that, though it can be used to do that kinda.
[14:44:53] <robertmaxrees> promises are just a different way to manage callback.
[14:45:30] <__joshua____> Dukuo: robertmaxrees is right, you need to target different elements
[14:45:43] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: the offset() and position() of the parent are always returning the same value even when the "top" or "left" scrolls out of view ... :(
[14:45:50] <__joshua____> or massively slow down page load by making the calls sequential
[14:45:52] <Dukuo> robertmaxrees, __joshua___ thanks, i'm trying it right now
[14:46:18] <robertmaxrees> benlieb http://api.jquery.com/category/offset/
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> check these out.
[14:47:50] <Dukuo> well silly me.. that worked flawlessly .. thanks guys, I was blocked :S
[14:50:36] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: turns out what I needed was not the offset but the scroll position.
[14:50:50] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:50:51] <benlieb> which sounds like it should be the offset, but it's not
[14:50:53] <robertmaxrees> figures.
[14:51:12] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: tnx for your help
[14:51:25] <robertmaxrees> of course.
[14:57:34] <frank_o> Hi! Does anybody know why this Embedly-embedded SoundCloud track will play and click just fine on desktop, but when emulating a mobile device in Chrome, you first have to click play, then play once more once the embed loads? http://jsbin.com/cilof/2/

[15:03:04] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete .data() is used to get and set data on nodes.
[15:03:36] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're using it for here.
[15:04:01] <tinkiete> robertmaxrees: oki
[15:04:22] <tinkiete> but it was to test if there is some thing inside
[15:04:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:12:11] <tinkiete> i was wrong
[15:18:06] <tinkiete> +++
[15:18:12] <robertmaxrees> okay
[15:35:27] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/v5pf9pg0/ <--- what am I missing here? totalCharges doesn't compute
[15:35:54] <robertmaxrees> .val() returns a string.
[15:36:01] <Woet> Kartagis: please provide a /working/ demo
[15:36:04] <robertmaxrees> also, parseInt() takes two args.
[15:36:18] <robertmaxrees> parseInt(string, radix)
[15:36:31] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: not necessarilt
[15:36:35] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:36:43] <Woet> robertmaxrees: the latter being optional, but recommended
[15:36:49] <robertmaxrees> *sigh
[15:36:52] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[15:36:58] <robertmaxrees> sure, it's "optional", and also a good ide.a
[15:37:04] <Woet> thats the definition of recommended, yes
[15:37:19] <robertmaxrees> "An integer that represents the radix of the above mentioned string. Always specify this parameter to eliminate reader confusion and to guarantee predictable behavior. Different implementations produce different results when a radix is not specified."
[15:37:33] <robertmaxrees> but hey what would i know ;)
[15:37:39] <Woet> i agreed with you
[15:37:40] <Woet> but alright
[15:37:44] <Kartagis> I'll do it tomorrow, I gotta go to bed now. gn
[15:37:53] <Woet> Kartagis: please provide a working demo tomorrow
[15:38:00] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis did you look at my initial points?
[15:38:06] <Woet> since, well, if you can't be bothered, neither can we
[15:38:20] <Kartagis> Woet: 2am here
[15:38:46] <robertmaxrees> you can't do greater than/less than comparisons on the return from .val() since it's a tring.
[15:38:47] <robertmaxrees> *string
[15:59:02] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/z3u0Lkhj/2/ <--- Woet, robertmaxrees
[15:59:23] <Kartagis> rate evaluates to NaN
[15:59:57] <Kartagis> .val() is surrounded by parseInt, still a problem?
[16:00:06] <robertmaxrees> again
[16:00:23] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window.
[16:01:22] <Kartagis> first three fields work with parseInt
[16:03:32] <Kartagis> I give up for tonight
[16:03:35] <Kartagis> gn all
[16:03:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:06:28] <robertmaxrees> btw totalKm.val(parseInt(closingKm.val() || 0) - parseInt(openingKm.val() || 0)); this doesn't do what you think it does.
[16:15:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah you need to setup fallbacks for each of those inputs for when they don't have a value.

[17:00:29] <TheBreaker1> hello All,
[17:00:29] <TheBreaker1> is it possable to target an element via an arbitrary selector? instead of say id or class. maybe something like toToggle
[17:00:37] <robertmaxrees> "toToggle"?
[17:00:43] <ronin2> what am I doing wrong $(data.context.children()[index]).value = file.name;
[17:01:11] <robertmaxrees> ronin2 .val(file.name)
[17:01:19] <robertmaxrees> .value doesn't exist on jquery objects.
[17:01:41] <TheBreaker1> robertmaxrees: yea, is it possable to set such things on a element?
[17:02:04] <robertmaxrees> TheBreaker1 still not following.  you mean like an aribrary attribute name?  or just a class?
[17:02:11] <TheBreaker1> yes
[17:02:15] <TheBreaker1> attribute name
[17:02:18] <robertmaxrees> you can, but it's not a good idea.
[17:02:26] <TheBreaker1> ok
[17:02:27] <robertmaxrees> data-* attributes let you do that, though.
[17:02:39] <robertmaxrees> prepend the attribute name with data- and you're golden.
[17:02:41] <sammych> $(data.context.children())[index].value ?
[17:02:53] <frank_o> Hi! Is there a more DRY way of doing: var isA = something.parents('#a').length, isB = something.parents('#b').length, isC = something.parents('#c').length, isD = something.parents('#d').length;?
[17:03:43] <sammych> make a pugin
[17:03:53] <robertmaxrees> write a function that returns that value of each.
[17:04:45] <robertmaxrees> frank_o also, I assume you mean .closest, not parents.
[17:06:45] <robertmaxrees> could do something like this: http://fixee.org/paste/708if00/
[17:08:50] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: looks good
[17:09:01] <frank_o> but idk if its worth it to be honest
[17:11:33] <robertmaxrees> it always is.
[17:11:43] <robertmaxrees> if you change your logic, you can change it in one place, not 4.
[17:11:54] <robertmaxrees> this is why you do abstraction :)
[17:12:07] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: also .closest works excellent. why is it preferred over .parents though?
[17:12:20] <robertmaxrees> .closest() stops when it finds the element you're looking for.
[17:12:24] <robertmaxrees> .parents() keeps going.
[17:12:48] <frank_o> oooh
[17:13:02] <frank_o> def dont want taht :D
[17:13:14] <robertmaxrees> since you have an ID, you want .closest() :)  also, you might want to turn your logic inside out.
[17:13:22] <robertmaxrees> if ($parent.find(')
[17:13:34] <robertmaxrees> err if ($parent.find('child').length)
[17:13:42] <robertmaxrees> which will be a little faster.
[17:15:26] <frank_o> very cool
[17:15:51] <frank_o> thanks for the lesson mate!
[17:16:12] <robertmaxrees> sure
[17:16:13] <frank_o> lessons rather
[17:16:35] <TheBreaker1> so ultimately I a trying to make a toggle method that I can call on a page with a bunch of data.
[17:16:35] <TheBreaker1> this should be working but its telling me my function is undefined any ideas?
[17:16:35] <TheBreaker1> http://jsfiddle.net/nsscfs4p/
[17:17:01] <robertmaxrees> TheBreaker1 don't use inline event handlers.
[17:17:50] <TheBreaker1> ok
[17:17:50] <robertmaxrees> also, your code doesn't make much sense.
[17:18:39] <robertmaxrees>  has joined #jquery
[17:18:40] <robertmaxrees> [2014:09:15:17:17:01] <robertmaxrees> TheBreaker1 don't use inline event
[17:18:41] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[17:18:44] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nsscfs4p/1/
[17:18:47] <robertmaxrees> do this instead.
[17:19:16] <robertmaxrees> the way you had it before (had it worked) would have added a new event handler every time you clicked on the button.  this generally isn't what you want.
[17:19:39] <TheBreaker1> right that will work, however I will be using this on a page with a bunch of dynamic elements
[17:19:47] <TheBreaker1> hence the function
[17:20:12] <robertmaxrees> then structure things a little differently, then.
[17:20:34] <TheBreaker1> hmm
[17:20:39] <robertmaxrees> let me show you one way.
[17:21:31] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nsscfs4p/2/
[17:21:39] <robertmaxrees> also, use css for that initial hidden state, not javascript.
[17:22:14] <TheBreaker1> ahhh i see
[17:22:15] <TheBreaker1> ok
[17:22:24] <TheBreaker1> so just do  a display none
[17:22:30] <robertmaxrees> yep.  like I did in that example.
[17:22:31] <TheBreaker1> i see, i see
[17:23:01] <TheBreaker1> cool i will give this a whirl
[17:29:13] <TheBreaker1>  robertmaxrees: should I make this into a function? or just slap it in a js file and call it in after jquery loads?
[17:29:31] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts.
[17:29:45] <robertmaxrees> it's already a function, just an anonymous one.
[17:30:04] <robertmaxrees> just really sure what you're actually asking, either way.,
[17:30:35] <robertmaxrees> *just not really sure
[17:30:38] <TheBreaker1> ok i see now
[17:30:49] <robertmaxrees> you could, for instance, do both of those things.
[17:31:30] <TheBreaker1> if I make it a function i will have to call it, where as if I just include the js by its self it will trigger on btn click
[17:31:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:31:55] <TheBreaker1> if i wrap it in a fuunction
[17:31:57] <robertmaxrees> you mean like you had before?
[17:32:03] <TheBreaker1> i will have to call the fucntion
[17:32:04] <TheBreaker1> yea
[17:32:05] <robertmaxrees> because that didn't make any sense to do it that way.
[17:32:09] <TheBreaker1> how you wrote it out
[17:32:23] <robertmaxrees> the way I wrote it out is an inline anonymous function.
[17:32:24] <TheBreaker1> i wont have to
[17:32:30] <TheBreaker1> ok

[17:33:36] <robertmaxrees> this is another way to do it.
[17:40:34] <ronin2> I cannot even get this working  $("#myid").value("test");, when i have <p id="myid"> ...
[17:40:52] <robertmaxrees> ronin2 it'd be .val(), not .value()
[17:40:59] <robertmaxrees> but that's not an input, that's a p./
[17:41:00] <ronin2> i tried with val also
[17:41:01] <robertmaxrees> you want .text9)
[17:41:05] <robertmaxrees> *.text()
[17:41:11] <ronin2> hmm
[17:41:12] <ronin2> ok
[17:41:19] <ronin2> true
[17:41:26] <robertmaxrees> .val() only works with form controls.
[17:42:00] <ronin2> what are form controls
[17:42:03] <ronin2> you mean button?
[17:42:04] <robertmaxrees> inputs
[17:42:11] <ronin2> oh
[17:42:12] <ronin2> ok
[17:42:24] <ronin2> <input val="x"> etc.
[17:42:27] <robertmaxrees> right
[17:42:30] <robertmaxrees> *value="x"
[17:42:41] <ronin2> :)
[17:42:45] <robertmaxrees> .val() accesses the value property of the element.
[18:34:00] <Xoro> Is it possible to make absolutely positioned elements respond to .click()?
[18:57:40] <shoky_> Xoro: yup
[18:59:09] <Xoro> I just worked around the issue by placing a 100% sized fixed element under the element in question. So the button does what I want and clicking anywhere else reverses it. The intended design but maybe not the cleanest execution.
[19:08:00] <joshlegs> can somebody tell me why this won't work? im sure it must be a syntax problem but idk where it might be
[19:08:03] <joshlegs> http://dpaste.com/1QRP47S
[19:11:14] <systemfault> Looks fine.
[19:13:36] <joshlegs> hmmm ok. thanks for the review
[19:14:52] <clu3> I have a jquery droppable  for a <span class="ui-droppable"> but somehow  it only works if i set style {display:block} for .ui-droppable. (Im using it together with bootstrap3). Is this an expected behavior?
[19:15:01] <clu3> jquery ui i mean
[19:15:21] <Sgeo> joshlegs: what do you mean by works? Looks like angular involved?
[19:15:46] <clu3> Sgeo no, no angular
[19:15:51] <joshlegs> Sgeo: django. i can display the user.first_name value.
[19:15:54] <joshlegs> but the alert won't alert
[19:15:57] <joshlegs> no alert happens
[19:16:16] <joshlegs> it's like the variable assignment breaks the script
[19:17:16] <Sgeo> joshlegs: works fine for me, alerting {{ user.first_name }}, in jsfiddle
[19:17:24] <Sgeo>     {{ user.first_name }}
[19:17:24] <joshlegs> hmmmmm
[19:17:25] <Sgeo> oops
[19:17:28] <Sgeo> http://jsfiddle.net/xd5gravr/
[19:17:30] <joshlegs> ok. thanks Sgeo
[19:17:36] <Sgeo> Look at emitted HTML?
[19:17:59] <joshlegs> i'll do that. tyvm for the help
[19:18:05] <Sgeo> yw
[20:36:49] <Prometheian> I'm doing an ajax call to pull a bunch of JSON data. I bind certain bits to my ko viewmodel, including an object with several sub items. I know I can get to the item via thing().thing().moreThings()[0] but in moreThings there are six items, each with an int. I want to output the items in moreThings but in order of that int (0->5). How best can I achieve this using jQuery and knockout?
[21:01:17] <Prometheian> Now I need to sort this...
[21:25:54] <wa5ted> yo
[22:11:34] <jaCen915> Hi all, can anyone explain why, on a site with jQuery, type ahead in the chrome dev tools shows two jQuerys? One a function one an object (eg ‘jQuery’ and ‘jQuery17103401247321162373), Thanks
[22:26:36] <Sgeo> Argh, jaCen isn't here
[22:31:50] <Sgeo> Anyone else wondering: Pretty sure it's how jQuery handles JSONP calls... adds a weirdly named function to global scope to act as the callback when the JSONP returns, since JSONP effectively calls a named global function
[22:42:17] <Besan> I need a real example of a responsive <div> swipe slide . . .
[22:43:49] <sammych> can you make a generic 'instanceof' function?
[22:44:02] <sammych> oh
[22:44:12] <sammych> blah instanceof window[type]
[22:44:18] <sammych> never mind
[22:44:44] <sammych> I was gonna add type checking
[22:45:35] <Besan> How can i create that << slide left 50px >> to trigger. With responsive slide effect ?
[22:46:48] <benlieb> does jquery have any effect for drawing the user's attention when a change has been made to the dom?
[22:47:05] <benlieb> some temporary flash of yellow or something
[22:47:06] <benlieb> ?
[22:50:24] <sammych> benlieb: http://api.jqueryui.com/highlight-effect/
[22:51:04] <ISmithers> Is there a way for me to detect when the user has finished resizing the window? As opposed to constantly during the drag/resize process?
[22:53:05] <benlieb> sammych: tnx

[23:14:11] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/z3u0Lkhj/6/ <--- why is totalCharges concatenating instead of mathematical adding?
[23:21:36] <Swap> hi there, any one facing the IE 11 table pagination issues
[23:42:24] <washeul> i am creating multiple text field by clicking a addfield button now i want to identify those field by clicking n them  http://laravel.io/bin/9bXVy
[23:43:11] <washeul> this script is only identifying the static text boxes
[23:43:14] <washeul> any idea
[23:47:01] <Kartagis> I see that you are mixing javascript with jquery on line #27
[23:47:42] <Kartagis> it can be written like #('#draggable1font').val() = font;
[23:47:49] <Kartagis> washeul: ^
[23:48:01] <washeul> http://jsfiddle.net/ca6jdy9s/
[23:48:11] <Cork> Kartagis: that won't work
[23:48:21] <Kartagis> will it not
[23:48:21] <Cork> you can't assign values to a function
[23:48:31] <Cork> #('#draggable1font').val(font);
[23:48:35] <Kartagis> oh
[23:48:39] <Kartagis> right
[23:48:56] <Kartagis> sorry for the mislead, washeul
[23:49:14] <Kartagis> by the way, I have a question mysels
[23:49:20] <washeul> Kartagis yes that i was experimenting here the clean code
[23:49:20] <Kartagis> myself*
[23:49:22] <washeul> http://laravel.io/bin/Dd6yo
[23:50:00] <washeul> pls ask
[23:50:05] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/z3u0Lkhj/6/ <--- why is totalCharges being concatenated with other values instead of mathematical add?
[23:51:48] <Uhkis> not enough parseInts
[23:52:35] <Kartagis> Uhkis: sarcasm or for real?
[23:52:54] <Uhkis> real
[23:53:03] <Kartagis> where?
[23:53:13] <Cork> Kartagis: never use parseInt(value)
[23:53:23] <Cork> always ALWAYS give a base
[23:53:29] <Cork> parseInt(value, base)
[23:54:20] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/z3u0Lkhj/7/ <--- like this?
[23:54:44] <Kartagis> Uhkis: parseInt(rate, base) ?
[23:54:54] <Cork> wrong nick :)
[23:55:05] <Cork> yes parseInt(number, 10) for decimals
[23:55:21] <washeul> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/ca6jdy9s/ if you click on the first & 2nd text ox the popup will come but if u create a text field by clicking addfield button ,the pop up will not come for that textbox
[23:55:21] <Cork> Kartagis: if you use parseInt(value) the number might be parsed as octals some times
[23:56:16] <Cork> Kartagis: and you still have a few parseInt without base
