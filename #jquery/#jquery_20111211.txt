[00:01:40] <IvanKuzev> good morning folks
[00:08:52] <IvanKuzev> come on gimme a problem to fix...i have a whole hour with nothing to do
[00:16:55] <danieliser> how can i take both $10 and 10 and get 10?
[00:17:18] <danieliser> tried parseInt.. get NaN instead
[00:20:25] <tgiglio21> Hi everyone. I have a fairly simple question, but I'm more than willing to PayPal someone some moolah for their time.
[00:20:33] <tgiglio21> I'm utterly stumped.
[00:22:05] <gnarf> ?ask
[00:22:06] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:22:37] <IvanKuzev> <danieliser> you can see if the first symbol is $ and if it is remove it and parse the rest
[00:22:54] <IvanKuzev> tgiglio21 : ask away
[00:23:08] <tgiglio21> Posting to a pastie now...
[00:23:17] <danieliser> i ended up using .replace('$','') on the value.. if its there its removed.. if not then nothing happens
[00:23:19] <gnarf> danieliser: parseFloat( someStr.replace("$","") )
[00:23:44] <donCams> hey Eviltwin
[00:23:55] <tgiglio21> http://pastie.org/2999278
[00:25:12] <dr0id> >> var a = 10;
[00:25:14] <donCams> so... i can't do myNamespace.myVar.filter('.item:nth-child()')
[00:25:56] <dr0id> why not ?>
[00:26:06] <donCams> i don't know. it doesn't work!
[00:26:33] <donCams> wtf am i doing wrong? i suck at life! i'm gonna go die now
[00:26:41] <dr0id> good luck
[00:27:01] <tgiglio21> IvanKuzez: Any idea how I can fix this?
[00:27:40] <IvanKuzev> try putting the jQuery('form#madmimi_inline').submit in a $(document).ready()
[00:28:13] <tgiglio21> I left all that out. It's in one. I just paraphrased.
[00:28:42] <IvanKuzev> ok...and form#madmimi_inline doesnt look right here
[00:28:57] <IvanKuzev> the form is with #madmimi id
[00:29:06] <IvanKuzev> not #madmimi_inline
[00:29:38] <Milos> How can I find all the possible uses of an object?
[00:29:42] <Milos> Is it possible on the console?
[00:29:54] <Milos> Basically I have a callback function and it takes two arguments event and ui, and I want to know what they are and what I can do with them.
[00:42:27] <Zogot> Ahoy
[00:42:55] <IvanKuzev> hello
[00:52:47] <danieliser> how do i access html attribute data-complete=""?
[00:53:09] <danieliser> thought .data('complete') would work
[01:03:48] <edgardo> I have a small problem here: http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/eshCM/
[01:04:03] <mukamike> hello
[01:04:06] <edgardo> I need the subnav not to show if the user just cruises by the navigation
[01:04:10] <edgardo> hi
[01:04:23] <mukamike> can i see what you are talking about?
[01:04:35] <macrocosm> edgardo ... checkout hoverintent plugin
[01:04:39] <edgardo> I mean, from content -> header .. the subnav flashes in between.. I need somekind of timer
[01:04:50] <macrocosm> hoverintent
[01:04:57] <Zogot> http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[01:05:00] <edgardo> is that jquerys own?
[01:05:12] <macrocosm> it does just what ya want and well
[01:06:37] <edgardo> I've tried to stay away from plugins, especially as this is going to be a commercial website
[01:06:41] <edgardo> but that works yeah
[01:08:19] <mukamike> can anyone give me a hand? http://mr.vicetto.com/ i want to make a margin and the css is not responding when i set #matrix bottom: 150px; for example. might be the jquery?
[01:09:47] <edgardo> in other words, I'd like to see if there's an easy way around this.. if not I guess I'm forced to use a plugin :X
[01:10:09] <WebDragon> mukamike: let me see
[01:10:28] <WebDragon> mukamike: which element is failing to respond?
[01:10:54] <mukamike> fixed!
[01:11:09] <mukamike> i was using bottom and margin-bottom worked
[01:11:35] <WebDragon> ah yeah. bottom is for position: absolute and position: fixed
[01:14:28] <mukamike> ooooh WebDragon , great tip! thnx :)
[01:18:37] <mukamike> are contacts forms a good way for people to contact me?
[01:18:42] <mukamike> through my site
[01:18:44] <mukamike> :p
[01:18:58] <mukamike> or just my email with mailto: would be better
[01:19:17] <mukamike> or an image with my email
[01:19:19] <edgardo> looking at hoverintent, wouldn't that become a problem when my subnav isn't inside <ul><li>, rather as a separate div that fires up. also it needs to be separate, cannot have the subnav inside the main nav for my reasons
[01:19:34] <edgardo> mukamike, it depends
[01:19:48] <WebDragon> mukamike: http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/  everything you need :)
[01:19:59] <mukamike> well if you know any inconvenience about using contact forms
[01:20:05] <mukamike> thats what i was kind of asking
[01:20:08] <edgardo> if you place a contact form, please make sure you have some hidden fields with traps for web crawlers
[01:20:24] <mukamike> mmm
[01:20:26] <WebDragon> mukamike: I generally prefer contact forms, because adding email addresses to the site itself makes it too easy for spam harvesting bots to scrape your site for the address
[01:21:09] <mukamike> thinking it that way id use an image lol
[01:21:24] <mukamike> ok contact forms then
[01:21:28] <mukamike> :) yaaai
[01:21:53] <edgardo> mukamike, you can do this by adding a hidden form like <input type="hidden" name="something" value="http://"> and then when the form is submitted you check that the value hasn't changed
[01:22:04] <edgardo> if it has, then the crawler probably filled it in ;)
[01:22:54] <edgardo> hidden form element I mean.. inside the main form of course ;)
[01:24:22] <edgardo> anyway, this was a bit off topic :)
[01:24:36] <mukamike> yeah sorry
[01:24:44] <mukamike> but im looking at jquery forms though
[01:24:49] <mukamike> :p
[01:24:53] <mukamike> http://www.tutorialchip.com/jquery/20-useful-jquery-contact-forms-tutorials/
[01:25:00] <mukamike> excellent stuff there

[02:03:12] <mukamike> hi ravenzz , good day!
[02:04:11] <ravenzz> hey there
[02:04:23] <ravenzz> sup?
[02:05:02] <baldaris> I assigned a var name , for a class hyperlink , now i want to find a div with similar id and remove a class , any suggestions?
[02:05:36] <ravenzz> define similar
[02:07:17] <ravenzz> are you trying to select divs that have the given var name has id?
[02:07:44] <ravenzz> i mean *var name* is a substring of those IDs
[02:07:44] <ravenzz> ?
[02:07:52] <baldaris> ravenzz:yeah thats correct
[02:08:11] <ravenzz> ok there is a selector for such kind of stuffs
[02:08:20] <ravenzz> ?selectors @ baldaris
[02:08:21] <bot-t> baldaris, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[02:08:43] <baldaris> a php script generated a hyperlink with class , bot-t:yeah looking at it
[02:08:44] <mukamike> all good ravenzz , coding (or trying my best)
[02:08:46] <mukamike> :p
[02:09:02] <ravenzz> ?bot @ baldaris
[02:09:03] <bot-t> baldaris, ?bot-t
[02:11:03] <baldaris> i tried using #id slectors , but i the id value generated is saved ina variable , on the fly..that value i need to select ni ids..not sure how to do that
[02:11:23] <Anime> http://jsfiddle.net/rkrkh/12/ - anyone knows how to load any amount of images you want concurrently and only display them thereafter? like with this fadein, but seems like concurrent loads are disrupting each other
[02:13:16] <baldaris> ps: http://pastebin.com/RLFD3YjX , this is the code which i have
[02:14:10] <ravenzz> baldaris var the_class = "foo"; var foo = $('[id*="'+the_class+'"]');
[02:18:17] <baldaris> ravenzz:nope not working
[02:18:25] <baldaris> what am i missing?
[02:18:28] <ravenzz> dunno
[02:19:40] <baldaris> can you explain the code which you gave me ?
[02:20:25] <Sabixkl> I need help
[02:20:28] <Sabixkl> check this code
[02:20:38] <Sabixkl> http://pastebin.com/nSxhne7J
[02:20:55] <Sabixkl> there is a variable name  _.itms[] there
[02:21:05] <Sabixkl> how do I access and change it from the outside?
[02:21:10] <Sabixkl> it's a jquery extension
[02:21:15] <Sabixkl> tmslider.js
[02:21:26] <ravenzz> baldaris yep, so your class is "foo", and then i am selecting any element which its id contain the "the_class" string/classname
[02:21:29] <ravenzz> baldaris http://jsfiddle.net/T4Daa/
[02:25:30] <baldaris> ravenzz:splendid...thanks a million...now i got it...and it worked
[02:31:08] <ravenzz> ya, you're welcome
[02:50:50] <frenocha> i'm trying to run some code upon window focus. could someone point me in the right direction? :)
[02:52:14] <frenocha> hm, focusin() looks interesting
[02:52:33] <frenocha> but that's just for elements, not the actual page :(
[02:56:21] <IvanKuzev> how about $(window).focus(function(){alert('testing')});
[03:17:35] <Axsuul> is .find() suppose to return an array of jquery objects?
[03:18:56] <ravenzz> it "construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements"
[03:22:11] <IvanKuzev> Axsuul: it searches the childrens..and their childrens...and so forth
[03:22:49] <Axsuul> is there any way to convert that jquery object, to an array of jquery objects?
[03:24:16] <ravenzz> uhm maybe you are looking for $.map
[03:24:24] <ravenzz> ?map @ Axsuul
[03:24:25] <bot-t> Axsuul, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[03:24:43] <Axsuul> ah yes, thanks
[03:35:44] <ganis> Sorry for loosely related question, but does anyone recognise this image as a jQuery/Twitter plugin? http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=10ii73r&s=5
[03:37:51] <IvanKuzev> i played that game 'mapple story' once :)
[03:39:19] <IvanKuzev> no idea otherwise
[03:45:33] <JKarsrud> what image? The twitter thingy?
[03:52:28] <edgardo> I have code like this: http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/mxXKZ/ -- How would I make a condition like: if $('.subNavWrapper').is('visible') then the command on the first line would be mouseenter, and if it's hidden then use hoverIntent?
[03:53:28] <ravenzz> is(':visible')
[03:55:13] <edgardo> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/mxXKZ/1/ ?
[03:55:49] <edgardo> because I don't want that delay of mouseenter if the submenu is already open
[03:56:13] <ganis> JKarsrud: Yes. In my tinypic there is a grab of a Twitter widget from a design that's been handed to me and I can't figure out if it's an off the shelf solution or something that the designer just conceived.
[03:57:37] <JKarsrud> it does look like some sort of premade widget for sure
[03:58:29] <JKarsrud> but I cannot be sure, why don't you just ask the designer? :)
[03:59:54] <ganis> JKarsrud: Oh theres an unhealthy level of separation beween design and development here. I've asked that the question be asked, but who knows when ill get a response.
[04:01:31] <IamTrying> How to do such UI with jQuery ?  e.g: http://mobile.componentart.com/
[04:01:43] <gloomer> ganis i would just use google to search some of the code
[04:02:44] <gloomer> IamTrying lots of code
[04:02:58] <IamTrying> :)
[04:05:55] <IvanKuzev> yeah and some of it serverside...it gives medifferent pages for ie8 and chrome
[04:07:08] <edgardo> now I'm trying something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/mxXKZ/2/ (JS console gives me unexpexted identifier)
[04:09:14] <IvanKuzev> you messed the first if
[04:09:18] <edgardo> missed a ) in my if-statement
[04:09:25] <edgardo> yeah, but still not working
[04:09:45] <edgardo> cannot call method 'apply' on undefined :)
[04:09:50] <edgardo> of*
[04:10:07] <IvanKuzev> gimme new fiddle
[04:11:30] <IvanKuzev> and mouseenter is typed incorectly
[04:11:55] <rails_noob> how is everyone this fine evening/morning
[04:11:57] <IvanKuzev> its mouseEnter unless you defined it manualy
[04:12:26] <IvanKuzev> i am good rails and its midday here
[04:12:40] <edgardo> IvanKuzev, http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/mxXKZ/4/
[04:12:43] <mukamike> :D
[04:12:45] <edgardo> here's where I'm at
[04:12:46] <Anime> is $(selector).find("div").first().replaceWith(this) faster than $(selector + " > div").replaceWith(this)?
[04:13:27] <Anime> considering theres only one div inside selector, or else > would match all of div children, i guess(?)
[04:13:45] <IvanKuzev> it shoud match only direct decendants
[04:14:14] <IvanKuzev> not the same as find
[04:14:45] <Anime> hm, how to specify find to only go 1 level deep?
[04:15:14] <Anime> .children()
[04:15:27] <IvanKuzev> yea
[04:15:28] <edgardo> IvanKuzev, with that code I get no errors but nothing is happening either when I hover on the list items
[04:16:00] <IvanKuzev> can you give fiddle?
[04:17:03] <edgardo> http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/mxXKZ/6/
[04:18:13] <edgardo> or do you want with html also?
[04:19:32] <IvanKuzev> well it curently looks for a ul inside a nav tag.(which may be ok) and mouseenter is messed up still
[04:19:40] <IvanKuzev> yeah it will be nice
[04:23:39] <edgardo> here's a very simplified version without the newest jquery code: http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/eshCM/ -- what I basically want is that when you cruise with the cursor from content -> header the submenu wouldn't flash on the screen.. same when you cruise from header to content
[04:23:59] <edgardo> you'd actually have to stop at the navbar in order to show it
[04:26:05] <edgardo> that's why I'm trying what I am now.. so if the submenu is already visible I would use mouseenter on navigation, else hoverIntent
[04:32:19] <IvanKuzev> trouble is that you tried to add hoverintend function dynamicly. try adding it with the other mouse checks
[04:32:59] <IvanKuzev> like after the mouse enter at the bottom of that last one.
[04:33:23] <IvanKuzev> and then make a visibility check inside the hover intend callback
[04:34:58] <edgardo> but as soon as I use hoverintent there is a delay.. so I need to check whether the subnav is visible before I tell the code to use either hoverintent or mouseenter
[04:35:03] <jackie99> what is the best dropdpwn menu to use?
[04:35:10] <jackie99> that is seo friendly
[04:35:19] <edgardo> jackie99, the one you make yourself :)
[04:36:10] <edgardo> IvanKuzev, I've also seen examples of setTimeout to achieve this, but wouldn't that just delay the visibility of the subnav?
[04:38:14] <IvanKuzev> edgardo: hoverintend looks ok..if it does what it says,,and yea settimeout only delays the execution of a function
[04:45:40] <ssj> hello
[04:46:22] <ssj> i m getting a object errror wen doing an ajax call
[04:46:27] <ssj> can anyone help?
[04:46:38] <ssj> the script runs fine on ff
[04:46:40] <edgardo> IvanKuzev, the hoverintent on it's own works like a charm.. the problem is that when a user does this: "hovers over the navbar -> goes down into the subnav section that opened -> back up to navbar" then the subnav disappears and re-appears for the timeout that is set in hoverintent. That's why I need to check if the submenu is visible.
[04:46:47] <ssj> but doesnt run on IE
[04:48:16] <IvanKuzev> ssj:look at ff console.if there are errors the ie might crash becouse of them
[04:49:19] <IvanKuzev> edgardo :so? make the check inside the function that shows it
[04:49:51] <ssj> IvanKuzev it runs fine in ff
[04:50:00] <ssj> doenst run in IR
[04:50:03] <ssj> IE*
[04:50:12] <ssj> and i got no idea how to debug in IE
[04:50:41] <IvanKuzev> try f12.
[04:50:56] <IvanKuzev> its a bit ugly
[04:51:26] <ssj> to be more specific
[04:51:33] <ssj> its a software which uses IE
[04:51:57] <edgardo> heh, my connection is acting up.. if anyone has said something to me, I haven't seen it :)
[04:52:13] <IvanKuzev> <IvanKuzev> edgardo :so? make the check inside the function that shows it
[04:53:08] <IvanKuzev> ssj:sorry cant help you without more information...and maybe after that
[04:54:29] * ssj hates IE
[04:57:10] <edgardo> IvanKuzev, that's what I have been trying to do with this: http://jsfiddle.net/solariks/mxXKZ/7/
[04:57:26] <edgardo> but you said something about dynamically calling the hoverintent
[04:58:13] <IvanKuzev> yes...its inside mouseover call
[04:58:25] <IvanKuzev> want me to rework your code?
[04:59:25] <edgardo> i've been fighting with it for several hours now, so yes. if it's not too much trouble it would be nice
[05:00:06] <IvanKuzev> ok...not promising anything cuz i have to guess most of the html
[05:00:30] <edgardo> wait
[05:09:21] <IvanKuzev> where the heck is writen no pm....i want to delete it
[05:14:25] <ssj> hey IvanKuzev
[05:14:26] <ssj> http://jsfiddle.net/uHqRV/

[05:21:48] <minna> Hai
[05:25:05] <minna> Hm, i really cannot get removeProp to work: http://jsfiddle.net/uaFNs/
[05:25:59] <minna> AH
[05:26:12] <minna> it's only for properties that are set by .prop() nothing else.
[05:26:28] <minna> Damn that's confusing
[05:28:27] <werner_> Hi
[05:29:16] <werner_> http://jsfiddle.net/NRDWT/2/ << im trying to make a little animation by moving a background-image. COuld anyone help me?
[05:29:27] <minna> Hm, where can i see what events that is supported on touch devices?
[05:31:03] <werner_> Whats wrong with setInterval?
[05:37:00] <werner_> http://jsfiddle.net/NRDWT/5/ hmm?
[05:39:18] <Robbington> Anyone tell me why this doesnt seem to work? .css({background-position: '-450px -580px'})
[05:41:47] <werner_> Robbington, .css('background-position': '-34px -34px');
[05:42:24] <RLa> doesn't {background-position: give error?
[05:42:35] <RLa> because of - in the middle
[05:42:56] <werner_> Ah yes. u are right, RLa
[05:43:01] <werner_> without -
[05:43:07] <werner_> backgroundPosition
[05:45:02] <Robbington> Still returns an error. SizeItems.children("." + ActiveClass).css('backgroundPosition' : '-450px -580px'});
[05:45:47] <Robbington> Abd the css page on Jquery says it should take both backgroundPosition and background-position
[05:47:31] <Robbington> There is the pastebin of what I am using
[05:47:32] <Robbington> http://pastebin.com/MfnSJEUQ
[05:48:25] <Robbington> Added the alert to the end for testing, the rest of the code works, if you comment out the last line, so seems to be a prob with css(background-positon)
[05:48:55] <werner_> Robbington, a } to much
[05:49:10] <werner_> or one { missing
[05:49:46] <werner_> Robbington, jsfiddle.net would helps more to find the problem quickly.
[05:51:37] <Robbington> (sorry, left the braket in when paste binned it), but it turned out to be background-position throwing an error.
[05:51:55] <Robbington> so backgroundPosition was right as mentioned by someone else a min ago
[05:52:45] <Robbington> Although, it does say on the Jquery site does say it takes both
[05:52:45] <Robbington> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[05:53:14] <werner_> Sorry. I didnt unterstand you ;)
[05:56:04] <RLa> Robbington, i think object properties must be proper identifiers
[05:56:19] <RLa> when not used as string literals
[05:57:32] <RLa> so using background-position as key there is not even valid javascript syntax
[05:57:54] <RLa> as string 'background-position' it should work tho
[05:58:32] <Robbington> Ahh, ok. I see
[05:59:27] <Robbington> While im here. If you could look at my code again, children("." + ActiveClass) doesnt work when the varible ActiveClass is 10.5
[06:00:06] <Robbington> so what would be the best way to find the class with a '.' in it>
[06:00:07] <Robbington> ?
[06:01:13] <dr0id> is 10.5 even a valid classname ?
[06:07:23] <werner_> http://jsfiddle.net/NRDWT/2/ << im trying to make a little animation by moving a background-image. Could anyone help me? Why is "a not defined" ?
[06:17:20] <IvanKuzev> why not use jquery animate
[06:22:11] <igore> When I hover over an element I display a popup that has been prepended to body, to overcome overflow:hidden of the parent container.
[06:22:33] <igore> now, when the mouse hovers over the popup it mousesout on the trigger.
[06:22:58] <igore> how can I retain the possition of the popup while the mouse is hovering over both the popup and the trigger
[06:22:58] <igore> ??
[06:25:55] <IvanKuzev> i dont know...here is a workaround....you hide the popup on the triger's mouseout only if its not on :hover
[06:26:38] <JKarsrud> werner_: well, you do call it amimation, not animation
[06:26:46] <JKarsrud> that might be a problem :)
[06:27:06] <werner_> :D you are right. thanks!
[06:27:31] <JKarsrud> werner_: works now? :P
[06:27:44] <werner_> yes. it works.
[06:30:57] <JKarsrud> good good :)
[06:31:35] <IvanKuzev> can i see it...maybe learn how you made it work
[06:37:17] <werner_> IvanKuzev && JKarsrud http://jsfiddle.net/NRDWT/47/
[06:40:24] <sunscreen> hey I want to make an effect where by the close button is clicked and the <div> container is made relative still staying the same position/dimensions and then shrinks down and moves into another icon in another div ...
[06:41:52] <beakybal4> hi
[06:42:10] <beakybal4> what would be the cause of .id returning "undefined" ?
[06:42:14] <IvanKuzev> ...thats a bit much. i think the jquery ui had a similar effect
[06:42:33] <IvanKuzev> sunscreen:ofcourse you can aways make your own
[06:42:58] <mukamike> hello
[06:43:14] <IvanKuzev> beakybal4 the whole line please
[06:43:26] <mukamike> can someone help me on a little something?
[06:43:50] <beakybal4> IvanKuzev: alert(jQuery(this).id);
[06:44:06] <IvanKuzev> thissss...wont work i think
[06:44:15] <beakybal4> ahhhh dw
[06:44:24] <mukamike> i cannot spot the property that makes the caption of an image have a left margin - http://mr.vicetto.com on the Selected section
[06:44:25] <beakybal4> my bad :/
[06:44:46] <IvanKuzev> i think you can get the id with .attr('id')
[06:47:06] <beakybal4> thanks IvanKuzev :D
[06:47:07] <IvanKuzev> mukamike: cant open anything on SELECTED
[06:47:23] <mukamike> no content?
[06:47:55] <JKarsrud> beakybal4: the problem is that a jquery object doesn't have the id property. so either you can use $(this)[0].id, $(this).get(0).id or $(this).attr('id')
[06:48:58] <beakybal4> JKarsrud: thanks, the second one worked :D
[06:48:59] <IvanKuzev> mukamike:nope.empty row only
[06:49:19] <beakybal4> it would also help if (this) was the element i was trying to get the ID of :3
[06:50:51] <JKarsrud> beakybal4: what do you mean?
[06:52:06] <mukamike> IvanKuzev: so weird, how come i see content, lol
[06:52:18] <mukamike> panic mode!
[06:54:53] <IvanKuzev> mukamike: i think its that caption on image plugin you use
[06:55:23] <mukamike> i see it correctly i wonder why
[06:56:09] <IvanKuzev> mukamike:dunno...it made problems for me even on ther demo site...

[07:14:39] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/jaaaX/ - how would one make jQuery in charge of the "more info on hover"? (I'd like it to fade in, plus I don't want too complex CSS)
[07:18:17] <muzone> I'll let you borrow my bungalow in French Polynesia for a month if you help me?
[07:18:29] <IvanKuzev> mukamike:sorry cant help you..hope you find something that works...
[07:19:00] <beakybal4> muzone: o.0
[07:19:11] <mukamike> IvanKuzev: yeah! no worries
[07:19:20] <mukamike> i found something that i think will work perfect
[07:19:28] <beakybal4> muzone: i'll help you :p
[07:19:43] <muzone> beakybal4: At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/jaaaX/ - how would one make jQuery in charge of the "more info on hover"? (I'd like it to fade in, plus I don't want too complex CSS)
[07:19:46] <mukamike> lol
[07:19:56] <muzone> You'd have to get there yourself though
[07:19:59] <beakybal4> LOL i heard you the first time :p
[07:20:03] <muzone> It's on the island of Ambryn
[07:20:12] <beakybal4> o.0
[07:21:22] <beakybal4> muzone: http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[07:21:30] <beakybal4> so you say like
[07:22:16] <muzone> http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ambryn/interesting/show/
[07:23:26] <beakybal4> $(#hover).mouseenter(function(){alert('ohai mouse')}).mouseleave(function(){alert('bai mousey')});
[07:23:33] <beakybal4> muzone: ^^ something like that
[07:23:48] <beakybal4> muzone: then do w/e you want in those enter and leave functions :3
[07:24:03] <beakybal4> muzone: pm me if you want me to do the whole thing for you, we could work something out.
[07:25:45] <muzone> well feel free to hit the fiddle
[07:26:42] <beakybal4> lol pm :3
[07:27:31] <muzone> forgot to mention i wish to use hoverintent
[07:27:51] <muzone> (already using it for my main menu, might as well use it here as well due to its excellent usability)
[07:35:23] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/jaaaX/2/ - I'm trying to move the "more info on hover" from CSS to jQuery. But what's left, why isn't this working?
[08:13:51] <MeirD> Hello
[08:14:40] <MeirD> Is there anyway i can get the list of all attributes of an element with their values? i.e. <div class="hello" id="bye">  => {"class": "hello", "id" : "bye"} ?
[08:15:59] <aro> i have a question - I am doing a fadeOut on a 'tr#id td' and it is executing the callback for each table cell. is there a way to make it only run once?
[08:17:57] <IvanKuzev> bind it to the tr
[08:18:03] <aro> how?
[08:18:11] <IvanKuzev> tr#id
[08:18:16] <IvanKuzev> without the td
[08:18:24] <aro> that won't work
[08:18:30] <IvanKuzev> why?
[08:18:34] <aro> you can't perform animations on tr's
[08:20:24] <IvanKuzev> the other way i can think of  is to use some boolean value to prevent the execution of the callbacks after the first
[08:20:54] <IvanKuzev> or dont use tables at all
[08:25:14] <aro> its tabular data
[08:25:17] <aro> why wouldnt i?
[08:26:30] <kenthree> why is the logged jquery object 0 length? http://zero456.com/test/1.html
[08:27:24] <IvanKuzev> aro: effects are harder on table.styling too i think
[08:29:14] <IvanKuzev> kenthree : first you dont add it to the body(dont know if thats really the problem) but you invoke find on the console.log()
[08:29:36] <IvanKuzev> ops...sorry.my bad
[08:29:41] <kenthree> IvanKuzev: isnt that valid html5 tho? :P
[08:29:56] <kenthree> but anyways, if I add .text() I still get an empty string
[08:30:22] <IvanKuzev> it gets the text of the first element in the jquery object
[08:30:27] <IvanKuzev> in your case the image
[08:30:38] <kenthree> after .find()
[08:30:42] <kenthree> shouldnt it be the p?
[08:31:06] <IvanKuzev> what are you trying to do..and it shoud not be find at all there
[08:31:54] <kenthree> I'm just trying to manipulate that html string..
[08:32:25] <IvanKuzev> ok...here is two line code
[08:32:51] <IvanKuzev> $('body').append($('<img src="pic.jpg"><p>I want this.</p>'));
[08:33:14] <IvanKuzev> this line adds image and p element to every body element i think you shoud have one of those
[08:33:37] <kenthree> no no.. I have an html string and I need to pull some data out of it
[08:33:54] <kenthree> for example "I want this."
[08:33:56] <IvanKuzev> console.log($('p').text()) and this pulls text from first p element
[08:34:17] <kenthree> but I dont want to attach it to the document :(
[08:34:40] <jackie99> what is the best menu that is also seo friendly, like css menu for example, easy to use and implement on your site
[08:35:07] <IvanKuzev> then try eq(1) instead of the find in your example
[08:35:23] <IvanKuzev> jackie99: look at the jquery ui widgets..
[08:35:50] <IvanKuzev> i think there is menu but it may be in development yet
[08:37:55] <IvanKuzev> kenthree : if eq dont work...try filter('p')
[08:39:34] <kenthree> IvanKuzev: that's really weird. filter works
[08:39:37] <kenthree> find doesnt
[08:40:25] <porusfrigyes> hi, can someone tell me why this won't work? http://m.hondaforum.hu/test.html
[08:40:26] <IvanKuzev> its not weird...find looks for child object that matches the selector...
[08:41:52] <kkuno> hi
[08:41:56] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/jaaaX/6/ - I'm trying to move the "more info on hover" from CSS to jQuery (so I can do fading but also simplify the CSS). But what's left, why isn't this working?
[08:42:00] <muzone> I'll let you borrow my beach hut at Ambryn, French Polynesia (http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ambryn/interesting/show/) for a month if you help me out.
[08:42:03] <muzone> What's going on kkuno?
[08:42:44] <kkuno> oh I'm making a simple js cms :)
[08:43:05] <porusfrigyes> i can't get the callback function of getJSON() working
[08:43:11] <kkuno> I need to select an element which must be the children of a second element
[08:43:26] <kkuno> so with css I would use    elem1 > elem2
[08:44:16] <kkuno> oh it seems that I can use the same syntax :)
[08:44:26] <kkuno> ok thx
[08:44:56] <muzone> http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/375412_194815500607526_100002372322650_400614_1702202600_n.jpg

[08:50:54] <MeirD> thnx
[08:51:05] <IvanKuzev> porusfrigyes:try putting the getJSON in a $(document).ready
[08:51:07] <baldaris> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/getAttributes
[08:52:54] <porusfrigyes> IvanKuzev: i can see in the server log that the site gets the Config.json, but no idea what happens after that
[08:53:09] <baldaris> http://pastebin.com/MYSDTwpf , by default i am hiding all the divs , when i select an id , i remove the class which hides the div...when i click again i need previuus div to hide...what logic i could use here?
[08:54:45] <IvanKuzev> $(div:not(.hiddencss)).addClass('hiddencss')
[08:54:58] <IvanKuzev> something like that
[08:55:04] <hofemich> hi there
[08:55:16] <dabear> baldaris: save the current selected element to a variable. next time, hide that variable
[08:56:11] <baldaris> dabear:okay let me try that
[08:57:57] <dabear> e.g. var $selected = $([]); $("something").click( function(){   if($selected.length) { $selected.hide();} /*....*/ $selected = new selected element    } )
[08:58:06] <dabear> pseudo code only
[08:58:16] <hofemich> since two month i'm working with jquery mobile. now i have my first problem. i can't get the fixed footer to work. can anybody help me? i'm using cms contao, for the html5 element "footer" im assigning the data-position fixed and the data-role footer. the footer is always on the bottom of the whole page. test-link: hofemich.net/contao_sandbox
[08:58:21] <dabear> adjust actions, events and variable name to your situation
[08:58:54] <hofemich> when i inspect the html, jquery mobile is adding the class-attribute fixed-inline instead of fixed-overlay
[09:00:06] <hofemich> can't find any solution/example that works for me on jquery site
[09:00:44] <porusfrigyes> IvanKuzev: tried it... now it's in a $(document).ready(), but still no result
[09:01:10] <RLa> one offtopic question, what namespaces solution are you using?
[09:02:05] <RLa> porusfrigyes, wrong ContentType
[09:02:57] <humanpipecleaner> ugh, is it possible for me to get the cursor position inside a textarea easily
[09:03:01] <humanpipecleaner> probably not :(
[09:03:36] <porusfrigyes> RLa: Content-Type:application/octet-stream
[09:04:26] <RLa> porusfrigyes, and you think jquery is supposed to know what to do with it?
[09:05:03] <porusfrigyes> RLa: well, at least it culd try to evaluate it
[09:05:06] <porusfrigyes> +o
[09:06:01] <RLa> try to eval random binary crap as javascript?
[09:06:47] <RLa> i could not imagine doing anything worse
[09:07:37] <porusfrigyes> just to think that it's random crap because its content type does not fulfill application/json ...
[09:07:48] <porusfrigyes> i can send random crap with application/json
[09:09:21] <RLa> then why are we using contenttype header at all :)
[09:09:40] <RLa> just check out how to send proper header on the server side
[09:10:50] <porusfrigyes> okay, now i send the right content type, but it still won't work
[09:13:15] <RLa> check if ready handler is executed at all
[09:13:38] <RLa> probably not
[09:13:53] <RLa> i doubt that is valid javascript at all
[09:14:24] <porusfrigyes> it is executed, i tryed with a simple alert
[09:14:38] <RLa> btw, $(function); is equivalent to $(document).ready(function)
[09:15:00] <RLa> so use $(function() { function body goes here });
[09:15:34] <RLa> i think you currently have ready argument evaluated eagerly before jquery is ready
[09:17:06] <porusfrigyes> isn't that ready function runned when all of jquery is ready?
[09:18:34] <RLa> yes, but arguments are evaluated/run first
[09:19:42] <porusfrigyes> so, what do you suggest?
[09:24:54] <IvanKuzev> use a php output with echo
[09:26:58] <RLa> porusfrigyes, wrap call into function() {}
[09:27:15] <porusfrigyes> hm... moment
[09:27:27] <RLa> so it will be evaluated when jquery is ready and evaluates it itself
[09:28:21] <porusfrigyes> okay... did it, still not working
[09:30:53] <MeirD> How do I get an object returned by a jquery selector, which returned a list of objects?
[09:31:02] <MeirD> .get() does not return a jQuery object
[09:31:16] <ThiefMaster> you already *have* the jquery object..
[09:31:25] <ThiefMaster> just omit the .get()
[09:31:40] <MeirD> but it is a list of objects..
[09:31:49] <MeirD> I want the last one..
[09:33:17] <RLa> porusfrigyes, add error handler to getJSOn
[09:33:25] <baldaris> what can i do to select all the divs inside a div with id?
[09:33:46] <RLa> #id div
[09:34:13] <_ramo> hi
[09:35:01] <_ramo> i try to use the http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote component , i return json strings like: ["{label: 'HP Home and Office Paper 500 sht, A4, 210 x 297 mm', value: 'HP Home and Office Paper 500 sht, A4, 210 x 297 mm'}"] but somehow the autocompletion does not work
[09:35:03] <baldaris> RLa:so if i want to add a class to all tge divs , do i need to use .each or just add class next to it to add the class?
[09:35:42] <_ramo> i use this code for the autocompletion http://privatepaste.com/3bf6f27e81/asdffds
[09:35:51] <RLa> baldaris, no, you already have set of those divs
[09:36:48] <RLa> baldaris, http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[09:37:14] <RLa> so $('#id div').addClass('myclass')
[09:37:44] <kTrain> I am trying to get a deferred to run after I run multiple ajax calls (which are dynamically set in an options array) http://jsfiddle.net/kellypacker/sFjxd/2/ but I can't figure out how to set up the function that holds the ajax to say it's done.
[09:38:34] <kTrain> seems like I ned to wrap it in return $.Deferred(function( dfd ){ }).promise(); but I don't know how to chain the .resolve() to multiple ajax calls
[09:39:38] <baldaris> RLa:yeah thats what i have been doing..its not showing the class in the div
[09:42:21] <RLa> baldaris, then try simpler selector first
[09:42:39] <RLa> and use something like firebug to verify whether class gets added or not
[09:43:34] <porusfrigyes> textstatus parseerror?!
[09:45:50] <RLa> your json looks valid tho
[09:45:58] <Nicktar> Hi
[09:46:16] <baldaris> RLa: yeah i am using firebug to check , class is not getting added..
[09:46:41] <baldaris> my problem is my basics are not proper...and i am working with a dynamic generated page with php
[09:47:03] <RLa> how you execute code that adds class
[09:47:12] <RLa> what you use on server side is not important
[09:47:15] <porusfrigyes> RLa: it is only valid when i use "-s to all values... it seems that '-s are not good, and one should the keys in "-quotes, too
[09:47:31] <RLa> what?
[09:47:40] <RLa> oh
[09:47:45] <RLa> those value strings
[09:48:49] <porusfrigyes> RLa: no idea why this is invalid, because its valid when i use that syntax in javascript
[09:49:07] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: json isn't javascript
[09:49:10] <RLa> yeah, json requires " and " on keys too
[09:49:13] <baldaris> RLahttp://pastebin.com/pUwxX43f
[09:49:17] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: you sould use json_decode to generate your json in php
[09:49:25] <Cork[home]> opps *json_encode
[09:49:28] <RLa> http://www.json.org/
[09:49:53] <RLa> it shows ceanly that keys are strings
[09:49:58] <RLa> and strings start with "
[09:50:11] <porusfrigyes> Cork[home]: yea, understood, but i just wanted to put together a simple config file
[09:50:30] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: json is A LOT stricter then javascript
[09:50:32] <RLa> please do not generate json manually
[09:50:38] <Cork[home]> ya
[09:50:51] <RLa> there are libs for almost every programming language
[09:51:19] <ravenzz> ["."]
[09:51:24] <porusfrigyes> RLa: as told, i just wanted a configuration file for my application, which i can read with javascript and php too :)
[09:51:29] <umren> hey, is there a method that will make each statement in .on('something', function(event)  - A SEPARATE EVENT?
[09:51:53] <ravenzz> uh what?
[09:51:59] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: in json quotes is dubble quotes, keys HAS to be wrapped in quotes
[09:52:18] <umren> ravenzz: if u do several statements in this event it will bind to 1 event
[09:52:26] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: and functions is forbidden
[09:52:45] <RLa> i think jsonp would allow arbitrary code
[09:53:02] <RLa> but good luck for reading that with php
[09:53:06] <Cork[home]> RLa: sure, cause jsonp isn't json, its just javascript
[09:53:30] <porusfrigyes> okay, thanks anyway for your help
[09:53:38] <porusfrigyes> appreciate it, really :)
[09:54:42] <porusfrigyes> anyway, it work even when i skip the documentready
[09:54:44] <porusfrigyes> +s
[09:55:10] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: you put your ready function in your json?
[09:55:17] <porusfrigyes> Cork[home]:
[09:55:24] <porusfrigyes> nope. http://m.hondaforum.hu/test.html
[09:56:09] <Cork[home]> thats risky...
[09:56:17] <RLa> i would not use unwrapped code
[09:56:28] <RLa> you might pollute globals
[09:56:32] <Cork[home]> if you ever try to touch the dom from there it will fail
[09:56:39] <baldaris> rla: http://pastebin.com/pUwxX43f , thats the code
[09:57:22] <Cork[home]> or rather it will have a chanse of failing
[09:58:25] <Nicktar> Hi, I have a documentready, that uses $(".trigger").hover(doit(), stopit()) that works just fine. But now I ajaxified that page and need to convert that to an .on() and just can't figure out, how... Could anyone give me some hints please?
[09:58:53] <Spigushe> hi there, i have one question
[09:59:13] <Spigushe> i cannot call the handler ".clic()"
[09:59:17] <RLa> baldaris, put in some debugging alerts to see if handler gets executed
[09:59:41] <Cork[home]> Nicktar: you need to bind the event on a parent that exists from the start
[09:59:50] <baldaris> Rla: ooh i removed it , i am able to get the alerts for the parsed div ids
[09:59:57] <Cork[home]> Nicktar: then add a selector for the element you add to on
[09:59:58] <nickynyfiken> hi I have a ajax call with jsonp and specified a jsonpcallback and context to this and it invokes the function but how do I pass in the data???
[10:00:03] <porusfrigyes> Cork[home]: i just want to do some initialization of variables, locales and so on, no DOM touching, the rest of the code will do that but i'll won't load that part dynamically
[10:00:26] <Cokegod> how can I use triggerHandler on a delegated event?
[10:00:37] <porusfrigyes> it's better to do on documentready by the way, i'll make it so
[10:00:38] <baldaris> remove class works fine , if in the code i embed the class..problem is i only need to show div , clicked link..
[10:00:49] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: the prob is, all your code that touch those variables would have to go into its success callback
[10:00:59] <baldaris> works..okay , but when you click second time , first result stays and second div appears at the top
[10:01:21] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: cause you don't know how long that might take, it can be 1 sec or 10 min
[10:01:58] <porusfrigyes> Cork[home]: so, what do you suggest?
[10:02:04] <Nicktar> Cork[home]: Thank you. I hope I got that right....
[10:02:27] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: an alternative would be to load it as a normal js file with a var my_variable = json;
[10:02:36] <RLa> baldaris, that seems some other problem
[10:02:39] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: that would block the page until it loads
[10:02:47] <RLa> baldaris, your current code is not adding elements
[10:03:17] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: or you would have to put the ajax call inside .ready, AND do all your code that uses the config values inside its success callback (preferably as function calls)
[10:03:53] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: else you have a risk of race conditions
[10:04:04] <Cork[home]> porusfrigyes: and a page that fails mysteriulsy
[10:04:21] <porusfrigyes> Cork[home]: i wanted to do the latter case you mentioned
[10:05:24] <Cork[home]> the $(function() { $.getJSON(.., function(data) {} }); is how it has to be done
[10:05:51] <Cork[home]> *then
[10:06:22] <Spigushe> Can someone help me with the handler ".clic()" ?
[10:06:26] <nickynyfiken> anyone used jquery ajax with jsonp? My code does not get into the success block I have tried to add jsonpcallback and invoke a function and it does but how can I pass in the data to there??
[10:06:49] <porusfrigyes> Cork[home]: by the way, any good ides on l10n/i18n?
[10:06:54] <porusfrigyes> *ideas
[10:06:59] <ravenzz> nickynyfiken do you have a live URL?
[10:07:11] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: what do you mean with live url?
[10:07:19] <ravenzz> Spigushe it is click() not clic()
[10:07:28] <nickynyfiken> I have another ajax call that get sent into the success but it has another controller (rails 3.1)
[10:07:30] <ravenzz> nickynyfiken a demo we cann see
[10:07:39] <ravenzz> -n
[10:07:45] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: aha no sorry , work stuff
[10:07:52] <baldaris> rla:could you think of something?
[10:08:09] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: the respond in chrome shows a hash with success: true and data: my data
[10:08:15] <RLa> baldaris, i gotta think about my work too :)
[10:08:17] <nickynyfiken> so I can't figure out why it is not working
[10:08:37] <ravenzz> nickynyfiken so it is impossible to me to be helpfull, you should debug that
[10:08:48] <ravenzz> ?ftj @ nickynyfiken
[10:08:48] <bot-t> nickynyfiken, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:08:53] <RLa> baldaris, it might be css issue too
[10:09:59] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: Yes it is much harder. but lets say you have a jsonp ajax call with an function as jsonpcallback and it gets invoked. can it get the data that should be sent?
[10:10:20] <nickynyfiken> or is the jsonpcallback function not able to utilize the data from the server?
[10:12:33] <ravenzz> nickynyfiken are you using getJSON() ?
[10:13:00] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: no ajax. should I use getJson instead isn't that the same thing really?
[10:13:16] <ravenzz> no buddy
[10:13:23] <ravenzz> $.ajax it's perfect
[10:13:32] <nickynyfiken> works on my other queries. sure they belong to different controllers in the back end but I mean in the network tab in chrome I can see the response is a hash with success to true and data with my data
[10:13:45] <nickynyfiken> ok cool then I am doing something right :D
[10:14:34] <ravenzz> so the server response is a valid one (200) ? no errors there?!
[10:18:08] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: yes it is valid, 200 OK, Request URL:http://localhost/inpage/inpage/?callback=jsonp1323627365035 and the response is "{"success:true, ""data":{.........}}
[10:18:36] <nickynyfiken> hm I got Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : in inpage/inpage/?callback=jsonp1323627365027
[10:18:43] <nickynyfiken> that might be it
[10:18:46] <nickynyfiken> or it must be it
[10:18:51] <nickynyfiken> hm
[10:19:37] <ravenzz> uhm
[10:19:48] <ravenzz> i think that you don't need that random number
[10:20:43] <nickynyfiken> well I don't do anything of that jqueyr does, this is my call.      jQuery.ajax({       url: 'http://' + getHost() + '/inpage/inpage/',       dataType: 'jsonp',       jsonpCallback: test(),       context: this,       success: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {         console.log('EYELLO');       }     });
[10:20:53] <ravenzz> just use the cache: 'false'
[10:21:00] <ravenzz> within your ajax req settings
[10:22:40] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: same problem
[10:23:55] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: someone said on stackoverlow it has to do with the server that I need to specify in the header that it is application/json
[10:24:26] <ravenzz> eh
[10:24:29] <ravenzz> yes of course
[10:24:57] <ravenzz> 1 sec
[10:27:40] <nickynyfiken> firefox said invalid label and then showing my response
[10:27:47] <nickynyfiken> which for me seems like the way I want it
[10:27:59] <nickynyfiken> is it because numbers are numbers and not strings?
[10:29:13] <nickynyfiken> tried it same result :(
[10:29:39] <ravenzz> nickynyfiken http://pastie.org/3001415
[10:30:42] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: well my call is a jsonp and a get other then that It seems like yours
[10:30:57] <ravenzz> sorry dataType: 'jsonp'
[10:33:04] <ravenzz> also I would check if the returned jsonp string is valid
[10:33:14] <ravenzz> http://jsonlint.com/
[10:34:00] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: it said valid json
[10:34:05] <nickynyfiken> thanks for the tip on that page tho
[10:34:58] <ravenzz> oh obvious question: is the file you are requesting into the same domain?
[10:35:30] <jackie99> how to do this effect bottom of the page?  http://blip.tv/ladrupal
[10:37:59] <walid> jackie99: what effect?
[10:38:24] <jackie99> at the bottom of the site there are 4 banners, hover effect?
[10:38:55] <jackie99> is it possible to extract all the jquery needed with the "inspect element" in Chrome?
[10:39:01] <nickynyfiken> ravenzz: found the difference between the one that worked and the one that did not. the one that worked (success callback being fired etc) the response is like this jsonp1323628513770({"exposures":841513,"visible_rate":0.337,"fill_rate":0.915}) but in my one that does not work it is not like that but just the hash
[10:39:15] <nickynyfiken> that is why it complains
[10:39:23] <walid> jackie99: i doubt that
[10:39:52] <jackie99> but the script files are accesible right?
[10:40:35] <walid> jackie99: they are, yes, but you need to find out where, and which fct does the effect
[10:40:37] <qinom> Does anyone know, where the mistake is:  http://jsfiddle.net/NRDWT/56/ ? No error returns but it didnt work, too.
[10:40:57] <walid> you're probably better off finding the plugin that does it
[10:41:24] <walid> or writing your own. my guess is that it's a simple transform: rotateY(180deg)
[10:47:13] <nickynyfiken> my jsonp response is displaying as an hash with {"success":true, "data":{......}} but it should be like jsonp123123123 etc why? :) anyone that have done alot of jsonp?
[10:48:39] <qinom> Does anyone know, where the mistake is:  http://jsfiddle.net/NRDWT/56/ ? No error returns but it didnt work, too.
[10:49:58] <KWhat_Mobile> there is no easy way to search for elements that have a particular data value is there ?
[10:51:39] <IvanKuzev> KWhat_Mobile maybe there is
[10:52:19] <KWhat_Mobile> IvanKuzev: what did you have in mind
[10:52:25] <IvanKuzev> input[name=something] works....maybe you can do input[data-somedata=value]
[10:53:21] <KWhat_Mobile> i am referring to the http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/ dom attachment, i think that only works with attributes
[10:54:12] <Nicktar> Cork[home]: Thanks you.... I got it working (basically) now I just have to figure out how to plug that into wicket...
[10:54:13] <IvanKuzev> i think it sets a data-key=value attribure.
[10:54:33] <Rabbi_Meish> hello
[10:54:33] <walid> jackie99: still here?
[10:54:33] <KWhat_Mobile> o really?
[10:54:36] <IvanKuzev> sure works from html to javascript but i dont know if you set them via js
[10:54:37] <walid> jackie99: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/UDctX/
[10:54:40] <walid> a start
[10:54:45] <walid> with no js
[10:54:51] <Nicktar> Bye all
[10:54:59] <jackie99> thx walid, i will check it out
[10:55:00] <KWhat_Mobile> IvanKuzev: ill give it a shot, do you know if that is documented ?
[10:55:34] <IvanKuzev> KWhat_Mobile : i read it somewhere in jquery documentation...but it was long ago
[10:57:06] <jackie99> walid, it is great, do you know how to rotate it back
[10:57:16] <walid> well
[10:57:22] <jackie99> it only rotates 180 and when you hover off it should retoun to previous state
[10:57:23] <walid> it does rotate back..
[10:58:33] <jackie99> with me it just jumps after you hover off
[10:58:44] <jackie99> jumps to the beginning, no rotation
[10:58:51] <jackie99> i changed 180 to 360 but nothing changes
[11:01:12] <walid> jackie99: 1sec
[11:03:14] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/UDctX/4/
[11:06:22] <walid> jackie99: then you need to play with it a bit
[11:06:38] <walid> but that's more or less what they do on the site, from what i can tell
[11:06:41] <TheDragoon> Good evenin everyone =)
[11:06:51] <walid> only with js rather than with css3
[11:07:41] <TheDragoon> Anyone has expirience in parsing XML to an array (preferable recursively)?
[11:07:53] <TheDragoon> experience * -,-
[11:13:01] <Acs> hello!
[11:13:44] <Acs> Anyone here know how to customize bassistance jquery validator
[11:13:55] <Acs> change the way the success method works
[11:14:20] <Acs> I can customize the error placement but not how the plugin treats valid fields
[11:14:22] <Acs> anyone?
[11:15:11] <abjorn> :o
[11:16:08] <Acs> I think this is a simple thing but I just can't seem to find how to do it
[11:16:18] <RLa> in javascript you cannot use class as keyword (identifier)?
[11:16:36] <Acs> in the custom errorPlacement function I made I add classes and elements which I want to be removed
[11:16:41] <Acs> RLa it's a reserved word
[11:16:43] <Acs> so no
[11:16:56] <RLa> why only ie thinks so?
[11:17:08] <Acs> http://javascript.about.com/library/blreserved.htm
[11:18:06] <RLa> thanks for the list
[11:18:39] <RLa> tho i'm not satisfied by browsers not giving proper error when they encounter these in wrong places
[11:24:23] <jackie99> thank yu walid
[11:24:56] <walid> jackie99: ur welcome
[11:25:03] <walid> could you make work nicely?
[11:25:22] <KWhat_Mobile> How many selectors can you string together?  Is it possible to do something like :selected:last ?
[11:26:14] <Acs> well.. I managed to make do with the success function
[11:26:23] <Acs> I get the parent().parent() of the label
[11:26:32] <Acs> oh well....
[11:26:44] <Acs> it's working
[11:29:50] <smurfke> Question: Attaching a click handler changes the scope of `this`, is there a way to prevent that behavior?
[11:30:52] <Zogot> you can store the this in a var
[11:30:54] <Zogot> before going into click
[11:30:59] <Zogot> normally called self
[11:31:01] <Cokegod> smurfke: it's not specific in jQuery, it's in JavaScript in general
[11:31:19] <Zogot> so prior to click, do var self = this; and in the click refernce self in place of this
[11:31:45] <cjoy> has someone here used jparallax with overlapping images ?
[11:32:47] <cjoy> trying to get click events to register for the visible content, rather than the overlapping transparent elements (top element gets all the cookies when the click event fires)
[11:32:49] <jackie99> walid, i updated it here  http://jsfiddle.net/UDctX/5/
[11:32:58] <jackie99> the text goes out of the borders
[11:33:14] <jackie99> i should set the width and align text for image right?
[11:35:39] <walid> i guess
[11:36:22] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/UDctX/12/
[11:36:24] <walid> there you go
[11:37:28] <walid> i don't understant why z-index has to have a delay of 0.25 and not 0.5s, though...
[11:38:02] <jackie99> http://jsfiddle.net/UDctX/14/   i would like to have transparent background , is the opacity:0.9; the answer?
[11:38:09] <jackie99> walid?
[11:38:50] <walid> jackie99: just have the .info have the pefect size and a background-color
[11:39:12] <walid> jackie99: erm. what should have a transparent background, act?
[11:39:50] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/UDctX/14/
[11:39:52] <jackie99> another problem is that you have to hover over the middle to turn the image, if you hover to the left it kind if flickers,......  transparent background below the text, .info so you can see an image in the background
[11:40:47] <walid> opacity:0.9 is not the answer, that makes your whle div transparent, including the text
[11:40:47] <jackie99> you have to hove in the middle otherwise it does not turn
[11:41:03] <walid> rather do:   background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);
[11:41:16] <jackie99> oh ok walid
[11:42:48] <walid> jackie99: and the flickering is there cause the .rotator has no size. http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/UDctX/16/
[11:44:48] <jackie99> great walid, you are a master
[11:44:53] <walid> (y)
[11:45:09] <jackie99> so this works on any sites that has jquery?
[11:45:22] <walid> jackie99: well this doesn't use jquery :)
[11:45:36] <jackie99> oh, you said that before
[11:45:42] <walid> but you could do the same in jquery, by animating properties
[11:45:43] <jackie99> but does it work in all browsers?
[11:45:45] <walid> nope
[11:45:51] <walid> not in ie<9
[11:46:00] <jackie99> ugh
[11:46:09] <jackie99> so jquery will work right
[11:46:12] <walid> http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions
[11:46:27] <qinom> How to access to this.variable in out-function:  http://jsfiddle.net/sU6f3/ ???
[11:46:40] <walid> and you need to add support to firefox by adding -moz-transition, etc..
[11:47:00] <walid> i'm guessing you use safari/chrome, considering the jsfiddle worked for you
[11:48:35] <qinom> hmm?
[11:48:58] <qinom> How to access to this.variable in the function called out:  http://jsfiddle.net/sU6f3/
[11:53:03] <qinom> Or here: http://jsfiddle.net/sU6f3/2/
[11:53:17] <qinom> out is everytime 0
[11:55:05] <_ramo> is someone using the autocomplet UI plugin?
[11:58:04] <Pupeno> Does anybody know how to trigger a select in query tokenizer?
[11:58:15] <jackie99> walid yes I use chrome
[11:58:29] <jackie99> uh, so i better opt for jquery
[11:58:46] <walid> jackie99: if oyu need support for ie, yes
[11:58:47] <jackie99> how long will the data be stored on jsfiddele site?
[11:58:57] <jackie99> ie 9 works?
[11:58:59] <walid> i decided to boycut it
[11:59:00] <jackie99> and ipad?
[11:59:18] <walid> hm for iPad i think there's a trick to simulate hover
[11:59:34] <walid> jsfiddle will stay
[11:59:42] <qinom> _ramo, yes
[12:01:05] <_ramo> qinom: is it possible to add a seperate link to every result that is found in the autocompletion box?
[12:03:12] <Pupeno> Anybody knows how to simulate a click with query?
[12:03:14] <Pupeno> jquery.
[12:04:18] <Eviltwin> Pupeno: see ?.click
[12:04:19] <bot-t> Pupeno, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[12:04:50] <qinom> _ramo, yes.
[12:04:51] <Pupeno> mmhhâ€¦ that didn't have any effect on my case, which I suspect it's tricky.
[12:05:17] <qinom> _ramo, but cant tell how in under 5 minutes ;)
[12:05:26] <_ramo> qinom: may with an example? :)
[12:05:40] <_ramo> i didnn't find one... may be i'm searchinb bad
[12:05:57] <Pupeno> Is it possible to simulate a press of enter with query?
[12:06:04] <Pupeno> damn auto-correctâ€¦ jquery.
[12:06:13] <Eviltwin> Why don't you explain what you're trying to do
[12:13:33] <_ramo> qinom: no code snippet for me?
[12:13:41] <qinom> sorry
[12:15:57] <Pupeno> Eviltwin: I did, but I suppose it's something nobody else did. Does anybody know how to trigger a select in query tokenizer?
[12:17:58] <Eviltwin> Pupeno: see ?.select
[12:17:59] <bot-t> Pupeno, .select(handler): Bind an event handler to the "select" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/select/
[12:18:06] <Eviltwin> Pupeno: Or more generically, see ?.trigger
[12:18:06] <bot-t> Pupeno, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:18:20] <janthony> Any idea why this .submit() isn't working? http://pastie.org/3001847 - the console.log's are functioning properly
[12:18:34] <gnarf> there is a select event? :)
[12:18:37] <Pupeno> Eviltwin: so, you think I should trigger a select?
[12:18:43] <Eviltwin> janthony: What's not working?
[12:18:59] <janthony> Eviltwin: It's not returning false and loading the page
[12:19:07] <Eviltwin> When are you running that JavaScript?
[12:19:23] <gnarf> i would think its going to be a "change" event - but it should be pretty easy to figure out what you need to trigger if you look in the code that is binding the event you want to trigger
[12:19:23] <janthony> Eviltwin: The alert isn't poping up either
[12:19:31] <Eviltwin> Pupeno: I think you need to...
[12:19:32] <Eviltwin> ?tias
[12:19:33] <bot-t> Try It And See
[12:19:47] <gnarf> janthony: do you have a form element name="submit" or id="submit" ?
[12:19:49] <Eviltwin> janthony: When are you running that JavaScript?
[12:20:04] <Eviltwin> gnarf: He does but that's for .submit() not .submit(...) and we'll get there
[12:20:07] <janthony> yeah, refer to my pastie. ;)
[12:20:22] <Eviltwin> janthony: When are you running that JavaScript?
[12:20:26] <Pupeno> soâ€¦ a select on what?

[12:20:41] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ Pupeno
[12:20:42] <bot-t> Pupeno, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[12:20:54] <janthony> Eviltwin: On document .ready
[12:21:14] <Eviltwin> janthony: I ask because I don't see a document ready here
[12:21:42] <janthony> it's because that is a snippet from the js :P
[12:21:46] <Eviltwin> Try adding a console.log($('#sales-contact-form').length);
[12:21:50] <gnarf> janthony: console.log( $("#sales-contact-form").length ) ?
[12:21:51] <Eviltwin> Where the other console.logs are
[12:21:52] <janthony> Eviltwin:  The console.log's are workign fine, so the jquery is working
[12:22:13] <Eviltwin> Looks like gnarf and I are on the same page here
[12:22:35] <janthony> Hrm, odd, looks like it returned 0 for length.
[12:22:35] <cpgo> if an ajax post goes to url1 and url1 does a redirect to url2, should the ajax call get the result of url2?
[12:22:40] <gnarf> Eviltwin: except mine is using jQuery whitespace style guide ;)
[12:23:00] <gnarf> cpgo: what kind of redirect?
[12:23:03] <Eviltwin> If only the jQuery whitespace style guide weren't wrong :P
[12:23:14] <janthony> wonder why jquery isn't finding that dom element
[12:23:18] <gnarf> Eviltwin: i actually have learned to love the extra spacing
[12:23:29] <gnarf> Eviltwin: but it took me forever to get in the style of using it
[12:23:39] <Eviltwin> cpgo: I think it depends on domain restrictions of the result
[12:24:02] <Eviltwin> cpgo: And redirects make a GET request, they can't pass on the POST
[12:24:26] <Eviltwin> But I would try it and see
[12:24:36] <gnarf> cpgo: XHR won't follow ALL redirects - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/282429/returning-redirect-as-response-to-xhr-request
[12:26:13] <gnarf> here is the spec on it: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/xhr/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#infrastructure-for-the-send-method
[12:26:33] <gnarf> so yeah, if it results in a cross-origin request, it fails
[12:26:58] <janthony> Eviltwin: gnarf: Got it working, thanks!
[12:27:08] <gnarf> janthony: what was it? :)
[12:27:29] <janthony> wasn't inside a document.ready() like I thought it was
[12:28:06] <cpgo> Eviltwin, gnarf, thanks it was my bad, its working now
[12:28:53] <gnarf> Eviltwin: so what is it you do that has you spending so much time in #jquery? I hear you're like our new support superstar :)
[12:31:17] <Rotham> hey
[12:32:05] <Rotham> does jquery have a way to select items by other random data attributes.. like if I add a "lolcat" attribute to a bunch of divs can I select all divs where lolcat=1 or something?
[12:33:00] <walid> jackie99: so what did you go with in the end?
[12:33:20] <jackie99> nothing walid, it does not work in ff
[12:33:56] <walid> jackie99: you need to add rules for firefox
[12:34:06] <jackie99> i dont know how to add that
[12:34:07] <walid> -webkit-transition = -moz-transition
[12:34:16] <jackie99> it will work in IE9?
[12:34:34] <walid> jackie99: in ie9 i think yes
[12:35:39] <walid> http://caniuse.com/
[12:37:28] <walid> oh, and i just found this :D http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/flip/
[12:42:47] <walid> jackie99: this might be interesting as well: http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/legacy/
[12:44:12] <smurfke> Zogot: I get what you're saying about `var self = this;`, but that's the thing I want to prevent.
[12:44:47] <smurfke> Cokegod: in that case, Is it a good pattern to use in javascript? or should I rather avoid this
[13:07:45] <Seppoz> hello, please how do i set the ID of an image object?
[13:08:20] <Seppoz> i would like to swap two images, one is already loaded and i would like to wait for the 2nd image to be loaded, as soon as its loaded i would like to swap them
[13:08:55] <Seppoz> http://pastebin.com/HNJTPes3
[13:09:00] <Seppoz> currently it looks like this
[13:09:13] <walid> Seppoz: see ?.load()
[13:09:14] <bot-t> Seppoz, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[13:09:22] <Seppoz> i did that
[13:09:37] <Seppoz> im stuck with removing the old image
[13:09:41] <walid> then just change the src attribute
[13:10:05] <Seppoz> does this work if it stays the same?
[13:10:26] <walid> if what stays the same?
[13:10:52] <Seppoz> the src
[13:11:46] <walid> do ou have a live example? or a fiddle?
[13:11:59] <Seppoz> do you see what i pasted?
[13:12:05] <Seppoz> its basicaly the same image
[13:12:07] <Seppoz> just reloaded
[13:12:16] <walid> yes
[13:12:28] <Seppoz> its generated by c++ code
[13:12:34] <Seppoz> i just need to request it again
[13:12:35] <walid> well by appending the img, you don't replace the content of #loader
[13:12:39] <Seppoz> and swap it
[13:12:50] <walid> oh. then you need more than that
[13:12:51] <Seppoz> yes.. how do i remove the old?
[13:13:03] <walid> you need to make a http request, no?
[13:13:17] <Seppoz> yes
[13:13:26] <walid> but to remove it, you can simply do smth like $('#loader').html(img)
[13:14:30] <Seppoz> ok this removes it
[13:14:37] <Seppoz> but now i have the issue that its not loaded
[13:14:41] <Seppoz> probably cached
[13:17:58] <PhonicUK> hey all - for some reason my datepickers won't obey the format I specify
[13:18:35] <walid> Seppoz: well you need to request it
[13:18:37] <PhonicUK> $("#licexpires").datepicker({ format: 'yy-mm-dd'}); still shows mm-dd-yy as the format in the textbox
[13:19:11] <walid> and you're right it's prob the cache
[13:19:16] <walid> but i'm no expert in that..
[13:19:23] <Seppoz> walid: how would i force a request?
[13:19:28] <PhonicUK> nevermind, I'm an idiot
[13:19:31] <walid> json/ajax
[13:19:42] <walid> i don't really know that's smth i need to learn
[13:19:46] <walid> but i would say ajax
[13:20:41] <walid> Seppoz: let me know when you did it, i'm curious.
[13:25:36] <Seppoz> walid: on it but never used jquery before..
[13:26:21] <Seppoz> is there a way to convert a jquery ajax reply to an image?
[13:27:01] <walid> this i don't know. but what about giving the images unique ids, btw?
[13:29:46] <Seppoz> doesnt help if its not reloaded at all
[13:30:15] <walid> well then you could change the src
[13:30:23] <walid> and i guess it would load it, no?
[13:30:59] <Seppoz> lets try this
[13:30:59] <Seppoz> sec
[13:31:34] <walid> i know i did this before, but always using an image from another webpage open in my browser, so i suppose it was already cached.
[13:34:18] <cornfeed> hello
[13:35:31] <cornfeed> if someone has a second, I am trying to run a .each() loop and it is causing it to add as many rows as are already there (doubling)  http://dpaste.de/JEw1U/
[13:35:54] <cornfeed> error source i think is on line 84
[13:36:07] <hightekvagabond> I have two separate ajax calls happening, one dynamically creates some content on a page, included in this content is a button that shouldn't be used until the other one completes. Both calls are started at the same time and I was trying to deal with race conditions and not knowing which one happens firstâ€¦. So, I threw a class on the button and was trying to modify that class as a result of the second ajax hitâ€¦ Th
[13:38:28] <Misiur> Hi, I've got problem where draggable works only once in IE - google found me this http://forum.jquery.com/topic/draggable-work-only-once-under-ie-6-7-8 but the topic is from 2 yrs ago, and next link is dead.
[13:38:34] <walid> does an ajax call not return anything?
[13:38:58] <walid> otherwise i could imagine doing some if(ajaxcall){load button}
[13:39:00] <walid> or smth
[13:39:16] <Seppoz> got it working
[13:39:52] <Seppoz> http://pastebin.com/v5jDyygc
[13:40:01] <Seppoz> the different url did the trick
[13:40:25] <hightekvagabond> walid: the problem is order, two calls called at once and I can't guarantee which order they fireâ€¦. if the first one doesn't return faster than the second one then there is no button to show, which is why I was trying to do it at the main css level instead of based on event because then it just wouldn't matter
[13:40:38] <walid> Seppoz: why did you html AND append img?
[13:41:12] <walid> and in the end, src is dektop.jpg01:12, and it loads desktop.jpg?
[13:41:32] <_ramo> hm, just didn't figured out how to add a custom link to each result in the jquery autocomplete plugin
[13:42:42] <Seppoz> walid: i want to remove the old image
[13:42:59] <Seppoz> is there a better way to remove all old images?
[13:43:15] <walid> hightekvagabond: well when the 2nd call returns true, change the button's class i think
[13:43:16] <walid> Seppoz: ok. but doesn't that give you 2 images??
[13:43:41] <walid> well calling div.html('smth') will replace div's content by 'smth'
[13:44:00] <Seppoz> walid: actually now
[13:44:02] <Seppoz> *not
[13:44:12] <hightekvagabond> walid: againâ€¦ problem is I don't know what order they fireâ€¦. the button may not exist yet, because it doesn't even exist as an element on the page until the first one finishes firing, so I can't just change the class of the button
[13:44:26] <walid> Seppoz: ... interesting.
[13:44:34] <walid> Seppoz: so what does html() do?
[13:44:36] <walid> and append?
[13:44:48] <hightekvagabond> html() does a replace
[13:44:54] <hightekvagabond> .append() does an append
[13:44:56] <walid> hightekvagabond: oh i get it.
[13:45:08] <Seppoz> if i remove append it still works
[13:45:22] <walid> Seppoz: ok
[13:45:31] <Seppoz> i think html is what i was looking for
[13:45:45] <Engin> guys, I'm lost a bit, I can't figure out a decent layout, way to tell required fields and errors... any recomentations ? http://beta.gettingback.at/#setSlide_post
[13:46:01] <walid> and i think hide(9 and show() are useless. i doubt that you have time to see it.
[13:48:14] <cornfeed> if someone has a second, I am trying to run a .each() loop and it is causing it to add as many rows as are already there (doubling)  http://dpaste.de/JEw1U/
[13:48:14] <walid> hightekvagabond: i'm no expert in that, but if an ajax calls returns smth, then you can wait for it to complete before next action
[13:48:32] <walid> so, you could do some if(call1 && call2){show button}
[13:49:16] <walid> not sure about this, but maybe you can even if(call1=smth && call2=smthelse){}
[13:49:28] <walid> to save the call's result
[13:49:31] <hightekvagabond> yeah, I thought about chaining the calls but it slows down the whole programâ€¦. was trying to have them happen asyncronisly so that they could both do all their processing at the same time in two different apache threads
[13:49:41] <Seppoz> walid: whats the best way for a timer?
[13:49:47] <Seppoz> not a singleshot but a continous
[13:50:01] <walid> Seppoz: sry?
[13:50:41] <Seppoz> got it :P
[13:51:00] <Seppoz> wow now we got remote desktop running :) now playing back the input events.. thats funny!
[13:52:11] <walid> hightekvagabond: then set a bool at the end of each call, and use it in a while(!call1done || !call2done ){} button.show()
[13:52:22] <walid> Seppoz: what are you guys doing`?
[13:53:52] <Seppoz> representing the framebuffer of a linux device on its webserver
[13:54:38] <janthony> Any idea what would cause a 200 ajax OK to return error? Via firefox console, if I click on the url that returned error 200 ok, it actually shows the echo'ed content from the ajax file that should be returning. Not sure why it displays fine there, but errors in console/on the page.
[13:55:46] <walid> Seppoz: ok
[13:55:49] <walid> sounds cool
[13:57:31] <walid> hightekvagabond: so?
[13:57:59] <kanzie> Im trying to copy what is in .data() but when I do var x = foo.data() and then delete x.bar, bar also gets removed on foo. Why is this and what should I do instead?
[13:58:46] <kanzie> should I clone() it
[13:59:28] <sodapop> hi, i have an input text item on a dialog, when return is pressed i close the dialog, the problem is that in firefox you get autocomplete as you type in the textbox and after the dialog closes autoselect values remain visible
[13:59:28] <hightekvagabond> walid: the ajax calls were nested inside other functions (which is why I didn't know what order they'd fire), this made it difficult to do the if that you were suggesting, I've set a global variable as a boolean flag and just check in both call back functions
[13:59:43] <hightekvagabond> which is cludgey but works and gets me on to the next thing
[13:59:46] <Eviltwin> kanzie: var x = $.extend({},foo.data())
[13:59:57] <hightekvagabond> made a "make this more eligant later" comment in the code
[14:00:00] <kanzie> Eviltwin: thanks, just found Resigs answer on SO too...
[14:00:06] <walid> hightekvagabond: hehe
[14:00:09] <walid> ok
[14:00:28] <Eviltwin> Or perhaps $.extend(true,{},foo.data())
[14:01:17] <kanzie> Eviltwin: don't think I need deep copy
[14:01:44] <Eviltwin> Probably not
[14:03:29] <Zamolxe> Hello. I've created a plugin called kiNotice http://ghita.org/ux/kinotice/demo/demo.php and after I read some articles about plugin patterns I decided to go with something simple. Please take a look at the source code of http://ghita.org/ux/kinotice/jquery.kinotice.js and suggest improvements. Thanks
[14:04:33] <minna> Hm, is navigator.userAgent a reliable way to get browser info?
[14:04:35] <Eviltwin> Zamolxe: I suggest you look at the jQuery UI Widget design
[14:05:26] <Zamolxe> Eviltwin, good point. Beside looking at the source code do you have any article that you might suggest?
[14:06:04] <Eviltwin> Zamolxe: Maybe http://bililite.com/blog/understanding-jquery-ui-widgets-a-tutorial/
[14:06:18] <Eviltwin> Or this: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[14:10:02] <minna> I'm trying to write the output of window.userAgent to a textarea, but i'm doing something wrong...
[14:11:29] <minna> shouldnt it be: $('#identifier').append(navigator.userAgent); ??
[14:12:49] <ravenzz> val()
[14:12:55] <ravenzz> minna ^
[14:13:26] <minna> val?
[14:13:38] <minna> val is for fetching value
[14:13:38] <ravenzz> you should use val instead of append
[14:13:51] <ravenzz>  $('#identifier').val(navigator.userAgent);
[14:14:05] <Eviltwin> minna: Please look at api.jquery.com
[14:14:20] <minna> you mean attribute?
[14:14:43] <Eviltwin> ?.val @ minna
[14:14:44] <bot-t> minna, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[14:14:56] <Eviltwin> Open the link
[14:14:59] <ravenzz> get or set
[14:15:00] <minna> im not trying to fetch the value, im trying to set it

[14:17:30] <Rotham> hey.. is there a jquery plugin that creates a sort of mini browser... I am creating an interface that will have 2 view panes (with html content, but not iframed), and I would like to keep a history of the content of each view pane and add a back/forward button for each pane
[14:17:40] <minna> Eviltwin: Yes, sorry.
[14:18:57] <cheshair> Hi! I have a few orders I have to show in a web page. Each order has a few main details (code, submission date, cost, ...). Each order is made up of a number of products, each product coming with its own price, quantity, ... I wish I could place my orders in a table, one per row, showing just main details. When clicking on the order code the row expands and shows products listing as well.
[14:19:10] <abjorn> split of the nets
[14:19:12] <cheshair> so I guess I need an expandable, nested table
[14:19:24] <cheshair> do you have any tips?
[14:20:12] <minna> Hm, doesn't seem to work anyway. No value is set, even though the element is found.
[14:21:34] <minna> Doesn't seem to work when the element is hidden.....
[14:22:31] <ravenzz> minna it doesn't ;)
[14:22:51] <minna> ravenzz: Um, why?
[14:24:17] <minna> ravenzz: hm, so i got the text in there, but it replaces the current text instead of appending it
[14:24:46] <ravenzz> yep
[14:24:57] <minna> How do i append it?
[14:28:41] <Eviltwin> minna: get, concatenate, set
[14:28:49] <ravenzz> ^

[14:29:23] <Alex82> how to get input from jquery dialog ? I noticed it doesn't print anything if used inside a generated div
[14:29:27] <Seppoz> im installing the mousedown handler, how do i get the x and y coordinates of the event?
[14:29:44] <Seppoz> http://pastebin.com/Yi1musAB
[14:29:54] <minna> ravenzz: Hmm, seem complicated for such a simple thing, but ok :-)
[14:29:57] <Eviltwin> Seppoz: The function gets passed an event object
[14:30:04] <Eviltwin> That event object has a pageX and pageY
[14:30:46] <Seppoz> can i get the relative ones ot?
[14:30:51] <ravenzz> minna anyway you can append text to the textarea iirc
[14:31:14] <ravenzz> something like $('textarea').append(' '+navigator.userAgent);
[14:31:34] <Eviltwin> Seppoz: Use $("#relativeToThis").offset()
[14:31:38] <Seppoz> where would i read about eventObject?
[14:32:03] <Eviltwin> Seppoz: Subtract the event's .pageY from the offset's .top and the event's .pageX from the offset's .left
[14:32:20] <minna> ravenzz: Thanks for the help, makes sense :-)
[14:32:27] <Eviltwin> Seppoz: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[14:33:28] <Alex82>  jquery dialog + form - I noticed it doesn't print anything if used inside a generated div - any clue?
[14:35:04] <Seppoz> thank you, that works like a charm
[14:39:23] <donCams> hello
[14:43:21] <Eviltwin> Hi
[14:48:25] <cornfeed> can someone tell me why this calls the function as many times as there are items in the object ?????    http://dpaste.com/672026/
[14:48:37] <cornfeed> please. i have been beating my head for hours
[14:50:25] <Eviltwin> Seriously?
[14:50:31] <cornfeed> ....yes
[14:50:31] <ravenzz> :D
[14:50:38] <Eviltwin> What do you think .each does?
[14:51:05] <Eviltwin> It literally runs a function as many times as there are items in the object
[14:51:09] <Eviltwin> Once for each item
[14:51:19] <cornfeed> i thought it was like a foreach loop
[14:51:36] <gnarf> it is... for each thing in the object, run a function
[14:51:38] <ravenzz> it is
[14:51:46] <cornfeed> ok i will change the function, thank you for that really basic explination i could have used hours ago :-P
[14:51:59] <Eviltwin> cornfeed: see ?.each
[14:51:59] <bot-t> cornfeed, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[14:52:09] * gnarf raises an eyebrow
[14:52:17] <cornfeed> Eviltwin: i understood it differently :-(
[14:52:30] <gnarf> how else could you understand that?
[14:52:41] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I'm really not understanding
[14:52:49] <gnarf> cuz if there is any confusion in the api docs, i'll happily try to correct it
[14:54:55] <cornfeed> Eviltwin: well actually i want it to do it on every object, I have a list of filter rules, and want to set a .click function for each one, this is a rre-numbering function
[14:55:56] <cornfeed> so previously they were all using onclick="" but that didn't allow me to re-number so I am looking into .click  which has been fruitless
[14:56:03] <cornfeed> https://github.com/cornfeed/cpanel_filters
[14:56:30] <Zamolxe> Eviltwin thanks for the links
[14:56:32] * gnarf sighs, remembering when jQuery was that complicated for me...
[14:56:58] <cornfeed> gnarf: sorry..
[14:57:11] <ravenzz> how many years ago? :p
[14:57:11] <gnarf> jQuery is one of those things that over time you realize that it really is easier than you think
[14:57:24] <gnarf> ravenzz: prolly jQuery1.3?
[14:57:48] <cornfeed> that is what i have begun to realize, which is why i came here, came i am at my ropes end, soo....any ideas other than my ignorance?
[14:57:52] <donCams> hey man... does jQuery have a spinner UI?
[14:57:56] <donCams> can't find it
[14:58:05] <gnarf> cornfeed: realistically - you have a design issue at a higher level
[14:58:18] <gnarf> donCams: by "spinner" do you mean an input that takes numbers and allows an up/down button?
[14:58:22] <gnarf> if so see ?spinner
[14:58:23] <cornfeed> ok explain, it is a plugin, it can be adjusted
[14:58:24] <bot-t> gnarf, UI/Spinner - http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Spinner
[14:58:28] <donCams> gnarf: yes
[14:58:42] <gnarf> donCams: jQuery UI has a spinner
[14:58:58] <donCams> i'm required to login?
[14:59:01] <donCams> jeez
[14:59:26] <donCams> i just thought that was a mistake. but apparently there's no content
[15:00:24] <memefilter> hi all - probably a noob question....
[15:00:27] <gnarf> donCams: sorry, bad link
[15:00:46] <donCams> gnarf: that's what's #1 in google search results
[15:00:48] <donCams> :)
[15:00:54] <gnarf> it seems spinner is 1.9
[15:00:59] <gnarf> i thought we had that released in 1.8
[15:01:02] <gnarf> but i guess not
[15:01:09] <donCams> oh...
[15:01:14] <donCams> crap
[15:01:28] <gnarf> you could still use it from the 1.9 milestone release prolly
[15:01:30] <cornfeed> Eviltwin: gnarf: you guys pretty much just said "really?" with no direction, if you think it is stupid you must have a solution, no?
[15:01:35] <donCams> guess i'll have to create mine
[15:01:45] <memefilter> this does NOT retrieve data when islive.txt changes: $('#playerarea').load('channels.html #<?php $channel = file_get_contents('islive.txt'); echo $channel; $channel = NULL; ?>');
[15:01:50] <memefilter> caching?
[15:02:10] <donCams> php in js?
[15:02:11] <memefilter> it'll load once, but doesn't respond to changed data
[15:02:18] <memefilter> IDFK lol - noooooob
[15:02:22] <gnarf> cornfeed: hard to give you any suggestions, but you like renumbering things / reassigning ID is not generally needed/smart
[15:02:29] <memefilter> it worked elsewhere in the doc
[15:02:39] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ cornfeed
[15:02:39] <gnarf> donCams: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2010/11/jquery-ui-1-9-milestone-3-spinner/
[15:02:40] <bot-t> cornfeed, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[15:02:42] <cornfeed> gnarf: well i can not think of a more clever way to renumber form items
[15:02:58] <gnarf> cornfeed: why do you need to renumber them? especially only the ID's, not the "name"
[15:03:01] <cornfeed> Eviltwin: oh i wish i could...its roundcube though...
[15:03:27] <gnarf> donCams: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138077/Spinner
[15:03:32] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ cornfeed
[15:03:33] <bot-t> cornfeed, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[15:03:37] <gnarf> donCams: are you already using jQuery UI for anything?
[15:03:39] <donCams> memefilter: i'm guessing it keeps loading islive.txt or it's using some long polling ajax. i'm a noob too
[15:03:42] <Eviltwin> Specific issue
[15:03:44] <donCams> gnarf. not yet
[15:03:45] <Eviltwin> Not your entire sire
[15:03:47] <Eviltwin> site*
[15:04:17] <gnarf> donCams: then go ahead and use the jQuery UI 1.9 / master branch and just grab the files you need - its pretty darn stable
[15:04:26] <cornfeed> gnarf: no i actually have the name renumbering working just fine. actually, very well. it's just once i approached the onclick="" renaming
[15:04:33] <gnarf> donCams: also, you might want to check jquerylist.com for another plugin thats already out there
[15:04:34] <donCams> cool. thanks gnarf
[15:04:36] <cornfeed> i have another approach idea... brb
[15:04:48] <gnarf> cornfeed: onclick="" for ANYTHING should be forever forgotten, and removed from EVERYTHING
[15:04:53] <donCams> just need it to copy http://css3button.net/
[15:04:53] <gnarf> ?inline
[15:04:54] <bot-t> don't use inline event handlers; instead, use jQuery's bind() or delegate() method in an external JavaScript file. Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren't reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can't normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.
[15:05:09] <cornfeed> gnarf: after this experience i agree, but the switch has been tough
[15:05:51] <donCams> gnarf: btw, it says .live is deprecated. but I have a problem with it. it doesn't listen to events from dom elements that were generated by javascript with load/append/etc
[15:06:01] <donCams> i mean i have a problem with .on
[15:06:11] <gnarf> donCams: you're just using .on incorrectly
[15:06:27] <donCams> figured.. i feel stupid. i'm gonna die now
[15:06:35] <gnarf> donCams: it helps to know how "delegation" works
[15:06:39] <cornfeed> donCams: .live doesnt work for items added with append()?
[15:06:53] <donCams> cornfeed: no, .live works perfectly
[15:07:07] <cornfeed> ok
[15:07:07] <gnarf> so like, with delegation you add an event to something "above" the element you want to catch, using a selector to filter the "inner" events
[15:07:10] <Alex82> which solution if i need to get input text values from a ui dialog ?
[15:07:14] <donCams> can't figure out .on though.. anyway, wordpress isn't using 1.7.1 yet
[15:07:27] <gnarf> so if you were doing $(".something").live("click", fn)
[15:07:32] <Alex82> i tried with html elements and i can save items into localStorage
[15:07:44] <gnarf> what that really is doing is $(document).on("click", ".something", fn)
[15:07:47] <Alex82> but through the dialog it does not print anything
[15:07:55] <donCams> oh
[15:07:59] <donCams> so that's .on syntax?
[15:08:05] <gnarf> its binding the "click" event on the document and looking for clicks that match ".something"
[15:08:06] <gnarf> ?on
[15:08:07] <donCams> crap! i was using .live syntax
[15:08:07] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:08:19] <mathi_> hi
[15:08:21] <gnarf> donCams: yeah.. also
[15:08:28] <donCams> wait. is it always $(document).on() ?
[15:08:33] <gnarf> its best if you can limit your "delegated" events to the small area they will be in
[15:08:42] <gnarf> well for live, it always does $(document).on()
[15:08:47] <gnarf> which is the downside of live
[15:08:53] <gnarf> or one of the downsides
[15:09:16] <gnarf> so if you know your ".something" is always going to be inside the "#container" which doesn't get added/removed from the dom
[15:09:27] <gnarf> its smarter to $("#something").on( "click", ".something" )
[15:09:36] <mathi_> I have a big string in "data" variable, starting with "<div class="cacheData" id="..."      I try to get all the div.cacheData => $(data).find('div.cacheData').each(function() {
[15:09:43] <gnarf> since then it won't have to check EVERY click on the page, only clicks within #something
[15:09:48] <mathi_> but it never goes into the each loop
[15:09:48] <donCams> cool. got the idea
[15:09:52] <mathi_> can anyone help please ??
[15:10:07] <gnarf> mathi_: if it is the "outermost" element, .find() wont find it
[15:10:19] <mathi_> ah
[15:10:23] <gnarf> see ?filter
[15:10:24] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[15:10:38] <Slartibart> Suppose some(maybe all) of some div siblings have the class ui-tab-panel, and all but one of them have the class ui-tab-hide as well. How do I find the index of the one without ui-tab-hide?
[15:10:43] <mathi_> gnarf, I can add a wrapper, would that be better ? or is filter fine as well ?
[15:10:49] <Eviltwin> http://www.youhavedownloaded.com/
[15:11:09] <gnarf> mathi_: either works... if you wrapped it all in an outer div it might make more sense to you :)
[15:12:34] <mathi_> thank you
[15:13:12] <memefilter> did anyone see my question (other than donCams) and know an answer?
[15:13:22] <memefilter> thx for the answer donCams :D
[15:14:58] <Eviltwin> memefilter: What?
[15:15:24] <memefilter> this does NOT retrieve data when islive.txt changes: $('#playerarea').load('channels.html #<?php $channel = file_get_contents('islive.txt'); echo $channel; $channel = NULL; ?>');
[15:15:38] <memefilter> is jquery caching the results?
[15:15:39] <donCams> i figured it could be using ajax long polling
[15:15:59] <donCams> or i just don't understand his question
[15:16:01] <Eviltwin> You know that PHP finishes execution before JavaScript starts, right?
[15:16:10] <memefilter> ah, no I did not
[15:16:12] <gosrt> Hey
[15:17:33] <memefilter> so even if the JS function is executed multiple times, php never re-processes that request?
[15:17:38] <donCams> that's next on my list: real-time applications
[15:17:43] <gosrt> I have a simple $(document).mousemove(function() { console.log("move"); }); on my site. But how can i unbind the mousemove action?
[15:18:01] <gosrt> I wouldnt get more "move" logs after a action.
[15:18:09] <Eviltwin> memefilter: PHP basically writes the JavaScript code and then once it's done writing, it gets sent to the browser and the browser runs it
[15:18:16] <gnarf> memefilter: yeah.... so like PHP is server side, it sends a result, then JS executes in the client
[15:18:44] <Eviltwin> The PHP's involvement ends when it goes to the client
[15:18:51] <gnarf> also, echoing PHP inside of JavaScript is like a pretty horrible practice
[15:18:56] <memefilter> alrighty - any hints on how I might work around it?
[15:19:08] <Eviltwin> It's called AJAX
[15:19:10] <Eviltwin> Look it up
[15:19:19] <memefilter> hehe, yeah I'm an audio engineer so not much experience
[15:19:31] <gnarf> memefilter: what is the "islive.txt" ?
[15:19:32] <memefilter> lol, the soap?  ;P
[15:19:55] <memefilter> it's a single number uploaded via ftp from mirc
[15:20:24] <memefilter> I should move to sockets but speed is priority over elegance ATM
[15:20:46] <Eviltwin> Um...sure
[15:21:31] <memefilter> basically typing "islive 3" in a chan would cause the site to load the video embed associated w/ "channel 3"
[15:21:44] <memefilter> oops - "!islive 3"
[15:21:58] <cornfeed> what does $('#myLink')[0] do? i have never seen the [] used
[15:22:00] <gosrt> a lol. there is a function called unbind :D
[15:22:08] <gosrt> cornfeed, array?
[15:22:21] <memefilter> it all works except subsequent calls to the function
[15:22:30] <cornfeed> gosrt: i thought, but best sure, since ids are supposed to be unique
[15:22:44] <Eviltwin> cornfeed: $("...") produces a jQuery object
[15:22:54] <gosrt> ;)
[15:22:55] <Eviltwin> A jQuery object is indexed like an array
[15:23:03] <Slartibart> Prev(), prevAll(), next() and nextAll() execution speed should be independent of the number of HTML elements on page, right?
[15:23:04] <cornfeed> oh i did not know that
[15:23:06] <cornfeed> thanks
[15:23:10] <Eviltwin> So if the collection contains 3 elements
[15:23:15] <Eviltwin> .length === 3
[15:23:23] <gnarf> memefilter: why not make a "channelsAjax.php" that only returns the section of HTML you want rather than the whole channels.html
[15:23:24] <donCams> wait. so if I have var mySomeClass = $('.someClass'); mySomeClass is actually an array?
[15:23:25] <Eviltwin> And [0] is the first one, [1] is the second one, ...
[15:23:26] <Eviltwin> etc
[15:23:28] <cornfeed> Eviltwin: it returns and array even if only one match
[15:23:33] <cornfeed> an*
[15:23:37] <Eviltwin> donCams: It's array-ish
[15:23:40] <gnarf> memefilter: then that can read from islive.txt and what not and return the proper chunk of html
[15:23:45] <donCams> :)
[15:23:46] <memefilter> gnarf: because I hadn't thought of it lol?
[15:23:49] <Seppoz> does QTcpserrver automatically figures out if ip addresses change? if i listen to any?
[15:23:56] <Eviltwin> cornfeed: It returns an array even if it's zero matches
[15:24:03] <cornfeed> haha ok
[15:24:05] <cornfeed> thanks
[15:24:07] <Seppoz> woops
[15:24:08] <Seppoz> sorry
[15:24:37] <gnarf> memefilter: seems that would work best in your scenario
[15:24:55] <donCams> hmmm. yes. just verified with console.log
[15:25:05] <memefilter> aight thanks a bundle - I'll bang my head against that for a while
[15:25:11] <gnarf> donCams: its "array like"
[15:25:17] <donCams> well... what it returned are actually a bunch of stuff
[15:25:31] <gnarf> donCams: its got a jQuery.prototype tho
[15:25:35] <gnarf> so it has all the jQuery functions on it
[15:25:41] <gnarf> but it behaves like an array
[15:25:44] <gnarf> also
[15:26:35] <donCams> now I know why I should be assigning selectors to variables and stop putting them inside loops
[15:26:36] <donCams> lmao
[15:27:06] <gnarf> donCams: ALWAYS cache your selectors
[15:27:10] <gnarf> ?g cache your selectors
[15:27:11] <bot-t> gnarf, Creating Caching Rules - http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B15904_01/caching.1012/b14046/cache.htm
[15:27:13] <gnarf> boo
[15:27:16] <gnarf> ?g cache your selectors jquery
[15:27:16] <bot-t> gnarf, Does jQuery do any kind of caching of "selectors"? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/291841/does-jquery-do-any-kind-of-caching-of-selectors
[15:27:20] <gnarf> boo again
[15:27:21] <donCams> gnarf: i do. i just don't know the exact reason
[15:27:24] <donCams> now i know
[15:27:42] <gnarf> donCams: well the "exact reason" is every time you do $("#something") it has to search for something in the DOM
[15:27:59] <gnarf> the only time you want to make that search happen twice is if it might of changed since the last time you ran it
[15:28:32] <daggerhart> Hi all.  Is it possible to trigger multiple keydown events at the same time?   I am trying to make a link that when clicked triggers CTRL+SHIFT+C  (chrome html inspector)
[15:28:45] <gnarf> daggerhart: its never going to happen
[15:28:52] <donCams> thank you gnarf.. you've been really helpful... glad I didn't pay for all those tutorials that didn't offer shitaki mushrooms
[15:28:56] <daggerhart> gnarf:  thanks.  glad I didn't try too hard. :-)
[15:29:05] <gnarf> daggerhart: you might try console.inspect( elem ) tho
[15:29:14] <gnarf> that may or may not work...
[15:29:30] <daggerhart> gnarf:  very nice.  thank you, i'll play with possibilities with that
[15:29:32] <gnarf> i know inspect( htmlelement ) works on the console
[15:29:35] <Seppoz> daggerhart chcek : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/596481/simulate-javascript-key-events/596580#596580
[15:30:00] <gnarf> seems .inspect isn't on console
[15:30:00] <gnarf> sorry
[15:31:42] <daggerhart> basically, i'm playing with writing a simple extension that activates the inspector thingy in chrome.   just goofing around.  in FF there is a simple button for it
[15:31:46] <donCams> btw gnarf... u sure it's ok to use ui 1.9 on commercial code?
[15:35:33] <cornfeed> gnarf: Eviltwin: you two proved to be very helpful, thanks. my problem has been solved
[15:36:32] <cornfeed> but if you ask me, it looks pretty ugly, like most of my code :-/
[15:37:10] <cornfeed> http://dpaste.de/QZcKH/
[15:37:11] <gnarf> donCams: if you were still here - i'd say yes - but beware you're using basically "unreleased" versions - if you have bugs, they won't get patched as quickly :)
[15:40:25] <gnarf> cornfeed: $("#rules_container").on("click", "input.rule-adder", function( event ) { rcmail.cpf_ruleadd( $(this).closest(".rulerow") ); });
[15:40:34] <gnarf> thats how i would approach something like that
[15:40:44] <gnarf> and then make cpf_ruleadd accept the jQuery of the row
[15:40:49] <gnarf> and get rid of all your onclick bs
[15:40:54] <gnarf> and numbering requirements
[15:41:23] <gnarf> $(this)[0] is a waste of time
[15:41:28] <gnarf> $(this)[0] === this
[15:41:52] <gnarf> also $(this).attr('id',...) === this.id = 'rulerow'+i;
[15:42:18] <gnarf> and div[class="rulerow"] as a selector is also a waste of time, div.rulerow is MUCH faster
[15:42:53] <cornfeed> gnarf: good to know, thanks
[15:42:56] <gnarf> cornfeed: ^^^^ 9 lines of comments on your 9 lines of code ;)
[15:43:05] <cornfeed> lol. pretty bad :-P
[15:43:15] <cornfeed> thanks again
[15:43:39] <gnarf> cornfeed: but that "onclick" you have still makes me want to barf
[15:43:42] <gnarf> ;)
[15:46:01] <cornfeed> gnarf: lol
[15:46:06] <rickup> Hi all...  I did figure out a solution to a problem I was having but I am not sure why this code http://jsfiddle.net/s7LVU/  worked.  Can someone help me translate this to english or pseudocode ?
[15:47:09] <gnarf> rickup: i wouldn't suggest ever running that code on a production webpage
[15:47:18] <gnarf> thats what it translates to
[15:47:21] <gnarf> why are you hiding the body?
[15:48:02] <gnarf> also if(jQuery) will totally break if the site doesn't include jQuery
[15:48:11] <gnarf> ?js if ( notDefinedHere ) { }
[15:48:12] <bot-t> gnarf: ReferenceError: notDefinedHere is not defined
[15:48:29] <gnarf> if ( window.jQuery ) is safer
[15:48:42] <gnarf> that at least wont bomb with a Reference Error
[15:48:48] <memefilter> hey gnarf - that did it, works perfectly, thanks again
[15:48:57] <gnarf> memefilter: np - glad to help
[15:49:04] <gloomer> gnarf is just serving all the jquery advise today
[15:49:16] <memefilter> if you ever need audio engineering let me know ;)
[15:49:27] <gnarf> memefilter: I'm actually an ex-live sound engineer ;)
[15:49:37] <memefilter> WHAT?
[15:49:50] <memefilter> sry, my ears are a little scorched from live work :)
[15:50:06] <gnarf> small venue in my local town, like 3 years of way to many dB in my ears
[15:50:07] <gnarf> ;)
[15:50:47] <memefilter> yeah I did a few years on the boston circuit, then another year in LA, then called it quits basically because of volume
[15:51:23] <gnarf> my left ear is like permanently ringing today due to sinus issues
[15:51:35] <gnarf> :/
[15:51:47] <memefilter> yep, tinnitus is not fun
[15:52:31] <gnarf> agreed
[15:53:19] <memefilter> and now back to coding
[15:53:38] <gnarf> gloomer: not my first time on the chopping block that is #jquery ;)
[15:54:38] <gnarf> back when paul still did IRC updates lol: http://jquery.org/updates/category/irc/
[15:54:45] <gnarf> "gnarf and ngharo were #jquery champions this week"
[15:57:33] <gnarf> maybe i should step out of the way again so Eviltwin can answer em all ;)
[15:59:04] <Eviltwin> I've done quite a bit of question answering myself in here
[15:59:12] <mathi_> wasn't there a jquery-ui channel?
[15:59:30] <Eviltwin> I wish it still existed
[15:59:46] <Eviltwin> So many people come in here asking about jQuery UI
[15:59:53] <Eviltwin> And I do almost nothing with it
[16:00:11] <cornfeed> can i use ^$ in selectors? input#^idbegin
[16:00:23] <cornfeed> (outside of [])
[16:00:30] <Eviltwin> You mean asking if the ID begins with something?
[16:00:31] <mathi_> got a jquery-ui question :/
[16:00:35] <cornfeed> Eviltwin: yeo
[16:00:47] <Eviltwin> cornfeed: Gotta do that as [id^=...]
[16:00:52] <cornfeed> figured
[16:02:06] <rickup> Thanks for the replies.  It does not actually hide the <body> It hides this annoying "flicker" in IE 8 when a lengthy ajax form is loaded... I will use the window.jQuery instead thanks again for that info.
[16:03:09] <mathi_> I am loading content dynamically (from AJAX) into a tab, then do $("#tabs").load(1); works fine but it looks like the tab container doesn't contains the HTML added
[16:03:11] <cornfeed> roundcube 0.6: ... jQuery JavaScript Library v1.4.4
[16:04:20] <cornfeed> i think i will have to save the .on for the update :-D
[16:09:37] <gnarf> mathi_: support for both is handled in #jquery
[16:09:39] <gnarf> ?channels
[16:09:40] <bot-t> For support please go to #jquery or #jquerymobile. Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev - #jquerymobile-dev ; Meetings held in#jquery-meeting
[16:09:58] <gnarf> mathi_: as far as your tabs example goes, can you fiddle something?
[16:10:42] <mathi_> gnarf, I have set an overflow:hidden to the tab container, i consider it like a hack ... not very nice as I shouldn't have this problem
[16:10:50] <mathi_> but it fixes it
[16:11:02] <gnarf> mathi_: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/2LECB/ is a decent starter for a tabs demo
[16:12:36] <gnarf> cornfeed: ewww - 1.4 ?
[16:12:44] <mathi_> gnarf, thanks that great, I will prepare someth but now it's too late, gtg sleep :P
[16:13:07] <mathi_> if I see you tomorrow I'll send you
[16:16:32] <mathi_> .on() supports all the existing events ?
[16:17:15] <Eviltwin> mathi_: You mean like .bind, .live and .delegate?
[16:18:11] <systemfault> mathi_: Yes
[16:18:19] <mathi_> Eviltwin, I need something that acts like .live(), to have events on dynamically loaded html. But I remember that live() didn't support all of the events
[16:18:23] <systemfault> mathi_: It's meant as a "does everything" replacement.
[16:18:34] <Eviltwin> mathi_: What?
[16:18:51] <mathi_> Eviltwin, I wasn't clear?:)
[16:19:14] <Eviltwin> What doesn't .live support?
[16:19:25] <Eviltwin> (First, never use .live if you have access to .on or .delegate)
[16:19:34] <ajpiano> in 1.3 it didn't support change/submit/focus/blur but that was fixed in 1.4
[16:19:35] <systemfault> Guys... there a two ways to deal with events... add handlers to specific elements (.bind) and using event delegation (.live and .delegate)
[16:19:35] <Eviltwin> But what did .live not do?
[16:19:43] <Eviltwin> Oh, huh
[16:19:50] <gnarf> mathi_: not EVERY event bubbles
[16:19:56] <ajpiano> the "load" event isn't supported for everything
[16:19:59] <systemfault> .live and .delegate both had the same exact purpose.
[16:20:03] <ajpiano> except for direct binding
[16:20:08] <systemfault> And are now being replaced with .on
[16:20:36] <gnarf> .live() -> .delegate() -> .on()
[16:20:50] <kanzie> what is a good regexp to filter out all . except the first using .replace()
[16:21:10] <mathi_> why didn't they keep one method name like live() ?
[16:21:19] <gnarf> kanzie: there isn't one
[16:21:38] <gnarf> mathi_: cuz each one of those has a different signature
[16:22:03] <gnarf> but live() made us realize we needed a delegate() and then in 1.7 we relized we could just make everything use on()
[16:22:13] <kanzie> gnarf: really? must be some way to construct a regexp for that purpose? if not, should I perhaps split at first . and then replace all and merge the two parts?
[16:22:29] <gnarf> kanzie: thats not a "regular" expression
[16:22:30] <mathi_> gnarf, what do you mean that not every event bubbles ?
[16:22:46] <systemfault> mathi_: You understand blubbling?
[16:22:49] <mathi_> no
[16:22:54] <gnarf> mathi_: not every event bubbles...
[16:23:00] <gnarf> ?g event bubbling
[16:23:01] <bot-t> gnarf, Javascript - Event order - http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[16:23:12] <systemfault> mathi_: Read that article, very important.
[16:23:17] <mathi_> oki
[16:23:28] <panfist> using jquery ui tabs, if you switch between tabs that differ in height, you get a situation where switching between tabs also toggles the appearance of a vertical scroll bar in chrome
[16:23:31] <gnarf> mathi_: jQuery forces certain events to bubble though
[16:23:56] <systemfault> gnarf: Is there a chart or something for those events?
[16:23:57] <panfist> i was wondering what strategy would be smart to avoid this behavior
[16:24:28] <kanzie> gnarf: no, bit replace() can handle regular expressions from my understanding. You say no, so I tried to go at the problem from a different perspective.
[16:25:01] <gnarf> kanzie: i was saying "every period but the first" is not a very "regular" expression
[16:25:09] <gnarf> "the first" makes it pretty much impossible
[16:25:43] <kanzie> in perl I would just do something like (.)(?=.*?\1)
[16:26:14] <gnarf> ?js var a = "this.is.a.string.omg!".split("."); a.splice(1,a.length, a.slice(1).join(" ")); a.join(".");
[16:26:14] <bot-t> gnarf: "this.is a string omg!"
[16:26:36] <kanzie> gnarf: yep, just like I suggested thenâ€¦ thanks
[16:26:54] <gnarf> kanzie: that would match the first dot, - which is not what you'd want for replace
[16:27:12] <mathi_> gnarf, ok I got the capturing/bubbling thing ... I don't think I will have this problem? I don't have child and parent listening to same event
[16:27:23] <gnarf> kanzie: you could do it with a replace function
[16:27:29] <kanzie> gnarf: I don't understand what you mean, but your POC is kind of what I need
[16:28:33] <gnarf> ?js "this.is.a.string.omg".replace(/^(.*\.)(.*)$/, function( $0, $1, $2 ) { return $1+$2.replace(".", " "); });
[16:28:34] <bot-t> gnarf: "this.is.a.string.omg"
[16:28:36] <gnarf> hrm
[16:28:49] <gnarf> dunno why i failed on that
[16:29:18] <gnarf> kanzie: like the definition of what a "regular expression" is
[16:29:35] <gnarf> JS regexps don't have lookbehind
[16:29:51] <gnarf> so you can't match "dot other than the first"
[16:30:15] <gnarf> even most RE engines with lookbehind don't allow variable length lookbehind anyway
[16:30:28] <gnarf> its just not a "regular expression" kind of job
[16:30:38] <gnarf> because the expression is - well - irregular
[16:30:48] <coldhead> pschaw
[16:35:24] <kanzie> gnarf: thanks
[16:35:50] <hye> hi
[16:36:04] <hye> what is a good jquery plugin I can use to scroll images vertically in a cool way.
[16:36:15] <hye> i mean horizontally
[16:48:59] <mathi_> I try to use on(), but I can't get it work
[16:49:26] <mathi_> I load dynamically a table, and on each TR I must bind a click event
[16:49:36] <mathi_> $("tbody.dayBody tr.entry").on('click', function(e) { console.log('HELLO'); ...
[16:49:44] <mathi_> HELLO is never printed when I click
[16:50:53] <ajpiano> mathi_: $("tbody.dayBody").on("click", "tr.entry", fn);
[16:53:23] <mathi_> ajpiano, it works until I load new content ...
[16:54:29] <mathi_> ajpiano, by the way, this is working: $("tbody.dayBody tr.entry").live('click', function(e) {
[16:54:40] <mathi_> I have jquery 1.7.1
[16:54:55] <ajpiano> ohhhh
[16:54:58] <mathi_> but with on() it doesn't work
[16:54:59] <ajpiano> you dynamically load the entire table
[16:55:06] <ajpiano> i thought you were just adding more rows
[16:55:06] <mathi_> yes
[16:55:11] <mathi_> no
[16:55:23] <ajpiano> you need $(document).on("click", "tbody.whatever tr.something", fn)
[16:55:38] <mathi_> whaaaat
[16:55:38] <ajpiano> mathi_: you have to do the part in the selector with something that is currently in the dom at the time you run the code
[16:55:55] <ajpiano> $(document).on(...) is the same as $("whatever").live(fn)
[16:56:23] <Whirl3d> but you could assign the on handler once the table is added to the dom, right?
[16:56:29] <Eviltwin> $(".foo .bar").live("click",function(){...}) calls $(document).on("click",".foo .bar",function(){...})
[16:56:57] <Eviltwin> But first it wastefully builds a collection of all of the elements that currently match .foo .bar
[16:57:06] <mathi_> ajpiano, and if I have several of these click events, I will have several lines $(document).on("click", ... ?
[16:57:17] <Eviltwin> And has misleading syntax since it's actually binding to the body
[16:57:43] <ajpiano> mathi_: $(document).on(...).on(...).on(...)
[16:59:08] <mathi_> ajpiano, if I bind with click() (or live()), I bind an event to each of the elements matched by the selectors. With on(), do I bind only one event on the body ??
[16:59:38] <ajpiano> mathi_: you can do whatever you want
[16:59:57] <ajpiano> you can do $("#something").on("clck", "selector", fn); assuming something is in the dom when you start
[17:00:18] <ajpiano> the point is that .live() *is* nothing more than having events on the document itself
[17:01:33] <cornfeed> gnarf: its working gloriously now, thanks again
[17:03:16] <mathi_> ajpiano, if "tbody.whatever tr.something" returns 1.000 elements, will it bind listeners to thousand elements, or one single listener to the body ?
[17:03:27] <ajpiano> one single listener to the body
[17:03:37] <ajpiano> that's the way event delegation works
[17:04:05] <Eviltwin> And it's why event delegation is a good idea for large documents
[17:04:07] <ajpiano> it takes advantage of the fact that events bubble to their parents, and then tests conditions of the original target element to see if it matches the selector
[17:04:28] <mathi_> ajpiano, because I have read blogs about performance and number of elements you bind an event to, but it seems that I don't need to think about these concerns in that model
[17:04:58] <ajpiano> yeah, that's why event delegation isn't just a "magic bullet" to fix the whole 'dynamic elements' problem, it actually performs better for anything more than a handful of handlers
[17:05:21] <mathi_> simply beautiful
[17:06:38] <mathi_> ajpiano, but some events don't bubble to their parents as gnarf specified, is there a list available of these events that don't bubble?
[17:07:21] <ajpiano> in native dom, focus, blur, submit, change, and load don't bubble
[17:07:43] <ajpiano> jquery in as of 1.4 artificially bubbles focus/blur/submit/change
[17:07:48] <gosrt> Why is only the first added Image draggable??? http://jsfiddle.net/Eimer/5Utmt/
[17:07:49] <ajpiano> so that you can use event delegation on that
[17:07:53] <gosrt> Has someone a tipp?
[17:08:01] <gosrt> I cant see the problem.
[17:09:37] <mathi_> omg:) so I don't need to concern about my submit/change listerners... so great
[17:10:36] <mathi_> ajpiano, is it ok if I don't use chaining with on() ? no difference I guess
[17:10:50] <gnarf> most things bubble inside of jQuery
[17:11:06] <ajpiano> mathi_: whatever you wanat to do
[17:11:16] <gnarf> but like mouseenter/mouseleave - focusin/focusout etc only really make sense on the "non-bubbling" context
[17:11:26] <ajpiano> no reason to do $(document) a bajillion times on a row tho
[17:11:47] <gnarf> the $() isn't free yo
[17:11:52] <gnarf> (tm) gnarf
[17:13:26] <mathi_> gnarf, why would these make more sense in non-bubbling context?
[17:13:46] <gnarf> i should write a blog post about caching selectors and call it "The $() isn't free"
[17:14:14] <mathi_> gnarf, removing some $() ... thx for tip :)
[17:14:17] <gnarf> mathi_: well focusin is an event that says something inside of it just gained focus
[17:14:41] <gnarf> so like if you switch focus within the same element, you don't need to fire focusin again
[17:14:52] <gnarf> (at least not on the "same element" in question)
[17:15:22] <gnarf> if those events truely "bubble" things get a little messy, imagine reciving multiple "mouseenter" events every time you mouse through something
[17:15:28] <gosrt> Could someone help me with the bind and unbind functions? http://jsfiddle.net/Eimer/5Utmt/4/
[17:16:45] <Eviltwin> gosrt: You have a line $(document).bind('mousemove'); What are you trying to do with that?
[17:16:49] <gosrt> bind and unbind works the first time. If i add a new image, i cant drag it with my self-written drag-function
[17:17:23] <gosrt> Eviltwin, oh, it was a relikt.
[17:17:48] <gosrt> forget to delete it.  new : http://jsfiddle.net/Eimer/5Utmt/5/
[17:18:16] <gnarf> why are you unbinding?
[17:18:37] <gnarf> most times you need to "unbind" its a sign you're taking the wrong approach to a problem
[17:18:44] <coldhead> relikt?
[17:18:44] <timwis> Hey guys
[17:19:22] <timwis> What's the easiest way to style my form elements, particularly a <select> box -- do I need jquery ui plugins or is there a way to do it with regular jquery ui?
[17:19:36] <gosrt> gnarf, i want to drag the image to a spezial position. i the click event starts it should be fixed on this position. the unbinnd is, to fix the image.
[17:19:47] <gnarf> although that document mousemove situation is one where its NOT the wrong approach
[17:19:55] <gnarf> however
[17:20:01] <gnarf> you might want to namespace the event
[17:20:10] <gnarf> .bind( "mousemove.mydraggable", fn )
[17:20:17] <timwis> (like jquery mobile automatically styles form elements)
[17:20:21] <gnarf> and .unbind( "mousemove.mydraggable" );
[17:20:29] <gnarf> that way it wont override others
[17:20:48] <gosrt> okay. i start a try.
[17:21:07] <gnarf> also
[17:21:57] <gnarf> that just seems a little backwards
[17:22:05] <gnarf> reading over this
[17:22:34] <gnarf> ahhh
[17:22:38] <gosrt> http://jsfiddle.net/Eimer/5Utmt/6/
[17:22:45] <gnarf> so your problem might be related to the fact that ID's are UNIQUE
[17:22:51] <gnarf> and you seem to be duplicating them
[17:23:05] <gosrt> argv. omg. Yes. u are right!
[17:23:07] <gnarf> why not var img = $("<img>",....)
[17:23:08] <gnarf> then later
[17:23:14] <gnarf> img.css({ whatever });
[17:23:28] <gosrt> !!!
[17:23:34] <gosrt> thanks.
[17:23:43] <gnarf> yet another case of "The $() isn't free"
[17:23:43] <humanpipecleaner> breauxs

[17:24:16] <gnarf> humanpipecleaner: lol @ the nick
[17:24:21] <humanpipecleaner> ty
[17:24:36] <gnarf> seems like if you can come up with nicks like that, you might be better than anything someone could write
[17:25:00] <humanpipecleaner> well i've been on a thesaurus and rhyming dictionary all day
[17:25:14] <humanpipecleaner> tryingto put words together  to find a great name for my company
[17:25:32] <humanpipecleaner> unfortunately i can't afford blackboard.com
[17:25:49] <humanpipecleaner> i'm limited to like 12 bucks a year for the domain LMAO
[17:26:03] <gosrt> gnarf, http://jsfiddle.net/Eimer/5Utmt/8/ hm?
[17:29:11] <gosrt> the problem exists furthermore :/
[17:31:31] <gosrt> gnarf, the mousemove isnt bind on the next time?!
[17:31:51] <gnarf> gosrt: i dunno - can't really dig into it right now either - got back to my own work
[17:32:42] <gosrt> gnarf, okay. thanks for you help.
[17:34:57] <gosrt> Has someone else a idea why the mousemove event wasnt bind the secound time? http://jsfiddle.net/Eimer/5Utmt/13/
[17:37:53] <durin> does anyone know of a shadowbox/lightbox style plugin that will do a full screen width slideshow with multiple images next to each other when you bring up the box?

[18:51:18] <Rotham> hey
[18:52:09] <Rotham> is there a jquery templating plugin?  (for generating html more easily)
[18:52:29] <Bankzilla> What are you needing to generate
[18:52:33] <Rotham> i need something that will help me generate code for fairly complex modals on the fly
[18:53:41] <Rotham> im currently putting it all into strings
[18:53:59] <Rotham> but it sucks to stringify/unstringify html constantly
[18:54:10] <Rotham> (while developing)
[19:02:59] <humanpipecleaner> if i have an event handler and i declare some variables, can i allow functions i call inside the same handler to access those variables?
[19:06:04] <FoolsRun> Hey, anyone have a sec to look at my function (that I stole from a blog post somewhere and tried to adapt) for setting cookies to keep checkboxes checked and unchecked between sessions?
[19:06:51] <panfist> i am using jquery ui tabs, loading tab content via ajax, but i want to add some jquery ui controls to the subsequently loaded tabs,
[19:07:05] <FoolsRun> Or, better, does anyone have a good drop-in script for remembering checkboxes with cookies?
[19:07:13] <panfist> how do i get this code to take effect when the new tabs are loaded?
[19:12:32] <panfist> using jquery ui tabs, if you switch between tabs that differ in height, you get a situation where switching between tabs also toggles the appearance of a vertical scroll bar in chrome
[19:12:36] <panfist> i was wondering what strategy would be smart to avoid this behavior

[19:26:04] <abjorn> I've never had one
[19:26:29] <imsky> are you one of those bros that prides himself on having a ridiculously high tolerance for alcohol?
[19:27:18] <abjorn> no
[19:27:25] <abjorn> I don't have a high tolerance
[19:27:33] <imsky> ok good

[19:29:05] <abjorn> Oh, I actually just put in my application.
[19:29:09] <abjorn> But I may not need it after all.
[19:29:24] <abjorn> You told me to go talk to da big bawss, well he actually came to talk to me the next day
[19:29:35] <imsky> sweet
[19:29:39] <imsky> what happened
[19:29:44] <abjorn> my supervisor apparently put in a *very* good word. He told me he was pretty much sold on me
[19:29:52] <abjorn> and he wasn't satisfied with one of his devs
[19:30:03] <abjorn> and that he really liked the code and such on my blog and github
[19:30:37] <imsky> you're moving up huh
[19:31:51] <abjorn> or...to the side. no clue if it actually counts as a promotion
[19:31:59] <abjorn> I mean, in my mind, that's a step up, yeah lol
[19:32:33] <imsky> nice bro good job
[19:33:33] <abjorn> I'll probably hear more about it this week, dunno if I'm actually getting the position or not
[19:33:41] <abjorn> if not..that impact.js job is lookin' mighty fine
[19:33:48] <abjorn> ...even if it's in south austin
[19:34:43] <jamescarr> hi
[19:35:27] <jamescarr> I have a <script type="text/template"> node that I like to put mustache templates in. When I use $(path).text() I get the template just fine except in IE, in IE I have to call $(path).html()
[19:35:39] <jamescarr> any idea what the "proper" way is to get the content?
[19:36:43] <SionEngine>  Hi
[19:39:27] <imsky> jamescarr: just use .html for both cases
[19:40:27] <abjorn> yessireebob
[19:49:37] <abjorn> but yeah, imsky, turns out the manager in charge of the dev team was interested in a lot of the same things, node.js, couchdb, etc
[19:51:31] <imsky> abjorn: that's what's up. what do they use this for
[19:54:36] <abjorn> they don't use node.js or couchdb at all
[19:54:37] <abjorn> he just likes it
[19:54:41] <imsky> lol
[19:54:42] <abjorn> but hostgator is stuck in 2001
[19:54:43] <abjorn> so
[19:54:56] <abjorn> PHP and MySQL, dats wehre itz at loL!!1
[19:55:15] <imsky> ay
[19:55:20] <imsky> with 5.3, it's not so bad
[19:55:51] <abjorn> so that's why I've had 23 people this last week who had MySQL tables crashed that I had to fix :O
[19:55:58] <abjorn> well that's not PHP's fault
[19:56:02] <abjorn> but still
[19:56:08] <imsky> that's pretty much their fault
[19:56:20] <abjorn> nah most of the time it was a wordpress site
[19:56:27] <abjorn> one was joomlaz
[19:56:30] <imsky> lol
[19:56:34] <abjorn> two were custom coded, that WAS their fault
[19:56:35] <imsky> pinnacle of competence
[19:57:00] <abjorn> all the wp's were because...idk if a wp update came out recently, but they had all just updated wordpress
[19:57:10] <abjorn> oh, wait, no one was because of a shitty plugin
[19:58:32] <imsky> sounds like tons of fun
[19:59:26] <imsky> who's using node in large scale?
[20:00:25] <imsky> wut the f
[20:03:19] <imsky> abjorn: i'm gonna bounce homie, super exhausted
[20:03:28] <imsky> have fun at the crosspromotion
[20:04:11] <nexion> is there a function between height() and outerHeight() that counts the padding but not the border?
[20:23:23] <myndzi> i've got something like: $("#empty").clone().insertBefore("#empty")
[20:23:38] <myndzi> i wanted to do something to each of the children of the clone, but .each at the end of that doesn't appear to be right
[20:23:43] <myndzi> what am i missing?
[20:28:39] <superjacaman> hey guy .hasClass don't work in iphone safari?
[20:28:59] <jeax> hey yous guys, i'm looking to get started with jquery.
[20:29:19] <jeax> i'm guessing that something like this is not difficult with jquery http://space.equiet.sk/
[20:29:23] <jeax> except it would probably operate faster
[20:49:23] <dwarder> how do i find out where the post request goes using firebug?
[20:49:25] <dwarder> maybe other tool?
[21:09:46] <rroelofs> dwarder:  check the 'network' tab
[21:10:19] <rroelofs> I also thought ajax stuff shows up on the console.  I'm using chrome dev tools atm so I'm going from memory

[21:22:28] <nullwire> and no alert
[21:26:29] <dr0id> $.cleditor(options).change(function() { alert('hi'); }); I guess
[21:28:20] <nullwire> heyy i got it workin, thans dr0id

[21:30:28] <Pallet> Hi there
[21:30:45] <Pallet> does anyone know about speed profiling sites?
[21:30:51] <Pallet> oops, wrong channel
[21:30:58] <gnarf> Pallet: jsperf ?
[21:31:05] <Pallet> ah cool,
[21:31:14] <gnarf> ?jsperf
[21:31:15] <bot-t> jsPerf: JavaScript performance playground - http://jsperf.com/
[21:32:31] <Pallet> cool, I'll do some playing, I've just spend loads moving our site to a VPS and faster platform, but I'm convinced, there's not much in it, and if I use Chrome's profile timeline, it's saying the new host is slower
[21:32:32] <Spadeski> Sup everyone lets say I wanted to generate a 8 Digit string numbers and letters with jQuery how would I do it ?
[21:32:54] <Spadeski> Pallet can I see your site ?
[21:33:18] <gnarf> Spadeski: what numbers and letters?
[21:33:23] <Pallet> Spadeski, sort of, there's not a lot to see ;)
[21:33:33] <Spadeski> gnarf, Just random ones
[21:33:41] <gnarf> a-zA-Z0-9?
[21:33:44] <Spadeski>  Pallet Alright well post link if you care
[21:33:48] <Spadeski>  gnarf yuppers
[21:33:48] <gnarf> only upper, only lower?
[21:33:53] <Spadeski> upper
[21:33:54] <Pallet> Spadeski, old location http://uk.purchaseseal.net/E42961011F965366485A22F4DF286F5F/seal.php?cid=71&dloc=www.purchaseseal.com
[21:33:55] <gnarf> and why would you want that?
[21:34:04] <Spadeski> generate a acceess key for my pastebin
[21:34:07] <Pallet> new location https://109.123.110.105/E42961011F965366485A22F4DF286F5F/seal.php?cid=71&dloc=www.purchaseseal.com
[21:34:10] <Spadeski>  which is done this is last code
[21:34:14] <Spadeski> Pallet Checking
[21:35:01] <Pallet> Spadeski,, there's a chance that I've not moved the SSL cert to the new location, so that might be causing an issue
[21:35:06] <Spadeski> Pallet Is the page supposed to be 2012 in height ?
[21:35:07] <gnarf> ?js parseInt("zzzzzzzz",36);
[21:35:08] <bot-t> gnarf: 2821109907455
[21:35:12] <Spadeski> Pallet yeah :p
[21:35:22] <Pallet> I've also not moved to domain name,
[21:35:30] <Spadeski> gnarf Nice :D
[21:35:40] <gnarf> ?js Math.floor( Math.random() * 2821109907456 ).toString( 36 )
[21:35:40] <bot-t> gnarf: "sikp294p"
[21:35:42] <gnarf> ?js Math.floor( Math.random() * 2821109907456 ).toString( 36 )
[21:35:45] <Pallet> so I'm guesssing that could have an impacts
[21:35:52] <gnarf> ?js Math.floor( Math.random() * 2821109907456 ).toString( 36 ).toUpperCase()
[21:35:53] <bot-t> gnarf: "VSUN6F8"
[21:35:59] <Spadeski> Pallet lets say I wanted it to generate a different one every time
[21:36:13] <gnarf> Spadeski: ^^^
[21:37:21] <Pallet> it's not an easy thing to guage the two sites next to each other
[21:37:22] <gnarf> then just pad the left with 0's
[21:37:44] <Spadeski> gnarf very nice
[21:38:00] <gnarf> shrug, elementary ;)
[21:38:07] <Spadeski> ?js math.floor()
[21:38:08] <bot-t> Spadeski: ReferenceError: math is not defined
[21:38:22] <gnarf> truncates the fractional part
[21:38:28] <gnarf> ?mdc floor
[21:38:29] <bot-t> gnarf, floor - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor
[21:38:54] <Spadeski> gnarf - If I may ask what are you too the jQuery community ?
[21:39:09] <gnarf> Spadeski: I'm on a few of the jQuery subteams
[21:39:31] <gnarf> UI / Bugs / Testing - i guest star in Core / Infra
[21:39:55] <Spadeski> gnarf UI work so would you mind giving me feedback on my site ?
[21:40:18] <gnarf> Spadeski: does it involve reading a lot of JS? :)
[21:40:34] <Spadeski> Only if you wanna theres no errors so far :D
[21:40:48] <gnarf> well JS is what i'd find interesting about it
[21:40:54] <sunscreen> hrm cant seem to get jquery.ui's .effect ('transfer',options,500,callback) thingy to work
[21:41:15] <gnarf> visual design != my thing
[21:41:37] <Spadeski> gnarf Only if you wannaa no errors so far , sorry getting link computer is slo
[21:41:38] <gnarf> ?p @sunscreen
[21:41:39] <bot-t> sunscreen, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:42:10] <gnarf> ?doesn't work @sunscreen
[21:42:11] <bot-t> sunscreen, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[21:42:36] <gnarf> also, "transfer" is such an annoying effect
[21:42:37] <gnarf> ;)
[21:43:21] <Spadeski> lol
[21:43:32] <Spadeski> gnarf: http://75.241.80.121/Gotactics/index.php Finishing it up tonight :D
[21:43:47] <sunscreen> there is no error
[21:43:52] * gnarf sighs
[21:43:55] <sunscreen> the callback function even completes
[21:44:03] <gnarf> i figured i might read something about the game go
[21:44:09] <Spadeski> No no no
[21:44:12] <gnarf> that sounded way cooler b4 i got to the page :)
[21:44:15] <sunscreen> there is no visuals!
[21:44:30] <gnarf> sunscreen: do you have the ui css file included?
[21:45:08] <gnarf> oh wait
[21:45:09] <gnarf> nvm
[21:45:10] <gnarf> The transfer element iself has the class name "ui-effects-transfer", and needs to be styled by you, for example by adding a background or border.
[21:45:15] <gnarf> have you done that?
[21:45:28] <gnarf> got that off of the docs page: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Transfer
[21:45:59] <gnarf> like try .ui-effects-transfer { border: 2px dotted #000; }
[21:46:04] <gnarf> and see if it does something then
[21:47:15] <Double_Rainbow> how was the guy from "Back to the future" named?
[21:47:23] <Double_Rainbow> matt? mack?
[21:47:35] <Spadeski> Double_Rainbow:  Neither I think it was michael
[21:47:43] <gnarf> marty?
[21:47:52] <Spadeski> yeah
[21:47:55] <Spadeski>  thast it gnarf
[21:47:56] <Double_Rainbow> gnarf: yaaa marty
[21:47:59] <gnarf> but like wtf offtopic
[21:48:02] <Spadeski> lol
[21:48:16] <gnarf> michael was the actor Spadeski
[21:48:37] <Spadeski> gnarf: Yup your mr. foxx
[21:48:38] <gnarf> and like i don't think that answered the question of HOW he was named
[21:48:41] <Spadeski> right*
[21:48:56] <Spadeski> His dad name in the movie was marty b4 he died wasnt it ?
[21:49:36] <MartyMcFly> all are registered :(
[21:49:42] <Spadeski> Lmao
[21:50:41] <Marty1McFly> haha :D
[21:51:15] <gnarf> sunscreen: did you see what i said about the ui-effects-transfer class in your CSS?
[21:51:33] <Spadeski> gnarf you think there would be a way to check if pipelining is enabled in Mozilla Firefox in the About:Config file
[21:52:02] <gnarf> *shrug*
[21:52:03] <sunscreen> yeah i have the ui-effect-transfer defined
[21:52:14] <gnarf> sunscreen: what are you giving it?
[21:52:25] <Spadeski>  Just wondering lo
[21:52:28] <gnarf> sunscreen: and also, see ?p :)
[21:52:29] <bot-t> sunscreen, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:56:22] <aroman> regex selectors.
[21:56:27] <aroman> do they exist?
[21:56:33] <gnarf> aroman: be glad they dont
[21:56:38] <aroman> gnarf: oh?
[21:56:44] <gnarf> aroman: what do you want?
[21:57:05] <aroman> to scrap an HTML page with JavaScript
[21:57:35] <aroman> jquery selectors + regex would do that splendidly, methinks.
[21:57:48] <gnarf> so write some jQuery selectors then use some regex
[21:57:57] <mansoor-s> aroman, you can get the content and run your regex thorugh that..
[21:58:09] <jeax> hey all--i'm on a company computer where i can't download things
[21:58:11] <aroman> mansoor-s: hmm?
[21:58:17] <jeax> is there a remote link to jquery so i can practice jquery while here?
[21:58:38] <gnarf> jeax: googleapis cdn - or any of the other cdns
[21:58:41] <gnarf> ?g cdn jquery
[21:58:42] <bot-t> gnarf, Downloading jQuery - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[21:58:50] <mansoor-s> aroman,  $('the parent to all of your content').html()   << run your regex on that
[21:59:06] <gnarf> jeax: also see ?jsfiddle
[21:59:07] <bot-t> jeax, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[21:59:20] <aroman> mansoor-s: no that wouldn't really be helpful
[21:59:33] <jeax> gnarf: thanks
[21:59:43] <mansoor-s> aroman, theni don't understand the problem :)
[21:59:48] <aroman> effectively I want a tool like BeautifulSoup in JS
[21:59:55] <gnarf> aroman: like seriously, state the problem you're trying to solve
[21:59:59] <gnarf> ?g beautifulsoup
[22:00:00] <bot-t> gnarf, Beautiful Soup: We called him Tortoise because he taught us. - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
[22:00:18] <aroman> gnarf: HTML parsing and scrapping in JavaScript.
[22:00:41] <aroman> say we have a full dom, I might want 'a' elements that have 'href' attributes that match a given regex pattern.
[22:00:50] <gnarf> aroman: like um...
[22:01:11] <gnarf> $("a[href]").filter(function() { return this.href.match(/regex/) });
[22:01:23] <gnarf> if you have JS - you have the DOM
[22:01:23] <aroman> yeah I guess tjat
[22:01:28] <aroman> that'd work.
[22:01:33] <gnarf> which is already better than this soup BS
[22:01:40] <aroman> not really
[22:02:21] <aroman> but yeah, that seems like a pattern I can use.
[22:02:49] <gnarf> aroman: jQuery + DOM Already has like all the tools you need to do this
[22:03:16] <aroman> gnarf: which is one of the reasons I decided to move away from doing this in Python :)
[22:03:20] <aroman> (with beautifulsoup)
[22:03:48] <aroman> and just do it in JavaScript since that's kind of what it was designed for.
[22:04:24] <gnarf> just beware of adding/iterating a ton of elements
[22:05:24] <coldhead> http://i.imgur.com/X4LOM.gif
[23:05:03] <svcghost> You cannot use AJAX to send a GET request to a website that is not on you domain, correct?
[23:05:11] <svcghost> your*
[23:06:30] <someprimetime> say i have : <div> <span><a></a></span></div>. would it be possible to hide the <span>, but at the same time show the <a> (thus effectively not hiding any of the inner children of <span>)
[23:07:21] <someprimetime> svcghost: i'm pretty sure you can, if your server-side script is generating the proper headers for it
[23:07:24] <karega|aniasis> when using the widget factory, how can I expose the methods defined in the $.widget() call
[23:07:29] <someprimetime> but i'm not 100% sure
[23:13:27] <svcghost> someprimetime: i don't think u can
[23:22:43] <DocNasty> Hey all, anyone here that can help me with an ajax call?
[23:23:42] <donCams> hello. this is where I need help.. http://pastebin.com/mdR0LSdT
[23:24:22] <donCams> how do I pass the value of styles, which I get from ajax, to swsoftqAppearance.styles
[23:24:58] <mazzachre> DocNasty: I would not put it past this channel... Though, who knows?
[23:25:37] <DocNasty> Ha, thanks mazz... I'm trying to return the text of an element i'm pulling in from yql  http://pastie.org/3003861
[23:26:13] <DocNasty> all I'm getting is blank text, but i've verified the xml thru firebug
[23:26:40] <karega|aniasis> how do I access prototype functions on an extended object?
[23:28:28] <mazzachre> DocNasty: Have you done a simple dump of the input? Just to verify? Also, I remember something about ajax and other domains... And that you have to do something to allow that...
[23:31:27] <donCams> help me http://pastebin.com/UXGgV62t
[23:31:30] <DocNasty> @Mazz, I've bypassing the crossDomain policy using yql, and i've verified the dump and xml in the firebug console, and looked at it in debug mode.  The xml is there, but I can't get the find to come thru.  Here are the dumps  http://pastie.org/3003889
[23:31:33] <donCams> why isn't it not extending?
[23:31:44] <mazzachre> DocNasty: Also... blahblahblah.empty() .. blahblahblah.append() could possibly be replaced with blahblahblah.replace() ...
[23:33:00] <mazzachre> DocNasty: Ah... Hmmm, that is strange then...
[23:34:07] <woozly> how to make fadeIn .html(content) ?
[23:34:13] <donCams> i'm gonna die now
[23:34:19] <DocNasty> @mazz:  I know, right?  It should be working just fine, but I think i've got an issue with the 'find' command somewhere, like it's not recognizing the data returned as xml
[23:34:28] <woozly> $("#mydiv").html(content); but how to make it fade in ?
[23:35:29] <donCams> $('#mydiv').text(content).css('opacity','0').animate({'opacity':'1'},'slow');
[23:35:32] <donCams> don't know though
[23:36:18] <mazzachre> DocNasty: Try and do something l ike var xmlObj = $(xml); and in the debugger stop it after that line, and look through the xmlObj object in the debugger... It will show you if the xml thing is working correctly for you
[23:36:41] <mazzachre> DocNasty: I don't do much in XML I'm afraid, so I am not able to help you much... mainly I do json...
[23:37:49] <DocNasty> kk.. will give that a shot.  last time i did the $.parseXML(xml) in it, and it returned an error of [object object].  I'll give it a shot tho and see what happens.  Appreciate the tip on the replace() function.
[23:44:03] <svcghost> I have a button that fadeIn() a div
[23:44:08] <svcghost> and another button to fadeOut()
[23:44:18] <svcghost> When I fadein, fadeout, and fadein again, it automatically fades out after fading in
[23:44:21] <svcghost> Any idea?
[23:53:44] <donCams> hello all... what am I doing wrong with line 20? http://pastebin.com/1TtwtWey
[23:57:26] <DocNasty> @Mazz, do you have a good example i can use to do a search/find with json?  Turns out i can use YQL to return xml or json
[23:59:06] <donCams> anybody awake?
[23:59:21] <Zogot> Yep
