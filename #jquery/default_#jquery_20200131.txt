[04:59:19] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[04:59:40] <silv3r_m00n> if i write $('.some-class') as $(document).find('.some-class');  is there any problem ?
[05:00:05] <silv3r_m00n> actually i am writing a function that takes a parent container as parameter and then finds inside that container elements of class some-class
[05:07:39] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: those two are exactly identical
[05:11:19] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: this is what the first one runs https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/init.js#L89
[05:11:32] <Cork> and in a webpage root === document
[05:18:43] <silv3r_m00n> oh great. thanks
[10:20:10] <V7> What might this be? https://i.imgur.com/qdA7BHx.png
[10:27:44] <AdamPDotty> It says :regex is not known to it.
[10:29:11] <thykka> it's an abomination c:
[11:06:23] <vish93> Hey guys in Magento, you have the following new function: https://pastebin.com/hReLhhXk but doesnt work in certain browsers like, chrome 43. Is there a reason?
[11:09:42] <taplar> I don't see an issue with that method, syntatically.
[11:10:49] <thykka> define "doesn't work"
[11:11:24] <thykka> is there an error? did the function lose it's job?
[11:12:22] <taplar> also, just to point out, none of that is jQuery.  so "you have the following new function" is incorrect any many different levels
[11:14:05] <vish93> taplar: me neither, https://pasteboard.co/ISxfLWZ.png is the issue
[11:14:27] <vish93> taplar: sorry I meant magento 1.9.4.4 introduces the said function
[11:14:45] <taplar> right, and this is a jQuery channel
[11:14:57] <taplar> not a javascript or magento channel
[11:14:57] <thykka> vish93, the error is elsewhere, the function you posted works fine as-is; https://jsfiddle.net/3s67bwqo/
[11:17:03] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList/forEach  NodeList support for forEach was added in 51
[11:17:52] <vish93> taplar! confirmed my suspision.
[11:18:33] <thykka> this begs the question; who still uses chrome 43? it must be full of security holes by now :D
[11:19:01] <thykka> like, that version is at least 10 years old
[11:19:56] <vish93> thykka: my colleague who has parental controls so can’t update HAHAHAHA
[11:19:58] <thykka> chrome should be evergreen, i.e. update itself.. unless some BOFH has decided that their company doesn't need security updates, and has set up some draconian group policy..
[11:20:22] <vish93> thykka: Like you know my crap company so well
[11:20:27] <thykka> right, well, they should probably ask their parents' permission to keep up with security patches :S
[11:21:08] <taplar> it's not unthinkable that a company would want to control which versions of a browser they have running on their machines
[11:21:38] <thykka> no, not unthinkable, and for LTS versions I'd agree, but afaik Chrome doesn't do the LTS thing, and even if they do, I doubt the last one was 49
[11:22:40] <taplar> sure, i was mainly offering a counter point to your "draconian group policy" statement
[11:23:07] <thykka> like, I know there are lots of companies still running some ancient, discontinued version of Windows, but they are putting their security at risk with that
[11:23:33] <vish93> thykka: 43 is far to bad and was Eol in 2015 I believe
[11:23:42] <vish93> tried telling him to update but get shutdown
[11:24:08] <thykka> are they also the person in charge of infosec?
[11:24:44] <vish93> They are the MD so would say yes
[11:24:55] <thykka> oof.. then the only option is to run :S
[11:25:28] <vish93> Only if I could show you the office hahaha
[11:27:17] <thykka> i mean, if you want to handle this professionally, you could gather a list of found security holes from the last 15 years, and ask if none of the holes worry them :P
[11:30:31] <vish93> thykka: I have told him, update the pc or use your laptop
[13:51:42] <relipse2> Does anyone know how to keep the original text box and make the color picker show up next to it? http://jsfiddle.net/bgrins/ctkY3/
[16:10:24] <mrkiwi> How to sum result in the console.log ..  result should be like the html: https://jsfiddle.net/csornmo/b9q0te2j/5/
[16:20:29] <mrkiwi> here is an update.. but need to get the value too --> https://jsfiddle.net/csornmo/b9q0te2j/7/
[16:27:35] <taplar> isn't the # for each key their value?
[16:28:50] <mrkiwi> taplar: this is more correct to follow --> https://jsfiddle.net/csornmo/b9q0te2j/13/
[16:29:03] <mrkiwi> I want output like I write in the HTML
[16:31:40] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/07gwLy1o/
[16:33:18] <mrkiwi> Thx taplar :)
[17:06:54] <primitivMedia> how do i test if an element is present on the page
[17:06:56] <primitivMedia> .length?
[17:15:28] <relipse2> $().length should do it
[17:15:40] <primitivMedia> it always returns 0
[17:15:49] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia then your selector is bad.
[17:16:03] <primitivMedia>  if($('.ofm-file.selected .ofm-file-preview video').length){
[17:16:22] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the HTML, i dunno how i can validate that's any good :)
[17:17:30] <primitivMedia> i have an element with the class selected
[17:17:33] <primitivMedia> i know that 199%
[17:17:34] <primitivMedia> 100%
[17:17:40] <robertmaxrees> show the html.
[17:17:40] <primitivMedia> even when i look for just that it fails returns 0
[17:17:55] <robertmaxrees> is the element inside an iframe or something?
[17:18:01] <primitivMedia> nope
[17:18:07] <primitivMedia> i think its dynamically generated
[17:18:07] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno then without seeing it.
[17:18:10] <primitivMedia> might that affect it?
[17:18:18] <robertmaxrees> only if you're trying to select before it exists.
[17:18:26] <primitivMedia> its on click
[17:18:27] <primitivMedia> so no
[17:18:28] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically generating as part of an ajax call?
[17:18:41] <primitivMedia> maybe?
[17:18:51] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:18:54] <robertmaxrees> how wouldn't you know lol
[17:21:48] <primitivMedia> i didnt build this app
[17:21:54] <robertmaxrees> share more code.
[17:22:00] <robertmaxrees> 20 question isn't very fun ;)
[17:23:09] <primitivMedia> its dynamically added
[17:23:18] <robertmaxrees> are you selecting before it's added?
[17:23:21] <primitivMedia> the original code doesnt ahve it in the html
[17:23:21] <makr8100> primitivMedia: based on your selector it's a 3-tier nested, you didn't accidentally omit the comma after .ofm-file.selected, did you?
[17:23:46] <primitivMedia> what do u mean?
[17:23:48] <makr8100> also in jquery using $(this) gets you the clicked element
[17:23:49] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia that only matters if youre trying to select before it exists.  dynamically added elements can be selected just fine otherwise.
[17:24:07] <makr8100> the first was why you've been asked to post html
[17:24:51] <makr8100> <div class="ofm-file selected"><div class="ofm-file-preview video"> ... more stuff ... </div></div>
[17:24:55] <primitivMedia> it works with html from the file
[17:25:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:25:05] <primitivMedia> anything dynamically generated does not work
[17:25:11] <robertmaxrees> then you're doing something wrong.
[17:25:28] <makr8100> then your event bindings are likely lost on dom update
[17:25:41] <robertmaxrees> they said they're getting 0 though.
[17:25:52] <makr8100> heh...
[17:26:03] <makr8100> that's right that would suggest the event is firing
[17:26:03] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: without any other code, it's near impossible to help.
[17:26:12] <robertmaxrees> and asking 1000x questions makes no sense.
[17:26:27] <makr8100> fair enough, and yes we need more code to be able to understand
[17:26:45] <makr8100> codepen or what have you
[17:26:59] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/PXJA
[17:27:20] <robertmaxrees> and the relevant js?
[17:28:31] <makr8100> oof the html I typed was wrong lol, video wasn't a class...  your html and selector look like they match
[17:28:34] <primitivMedia> ]https://bpaste.net/SYQA
[17:29:28] <robertmaxrees> sorry, had to dc.
[17:29:42] <makr8100> robertmaxrees: the js from primitivMedia
[17:30:01] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:30:34] <makr8100> between your dc and join primitivMedia posted the link to the js
[17:30:39] <makr8100> https://bpaste.net/SYQA
[17:30:41] <robertmaxrees> 1 se.
[17:30:42] <makr8100> oh I forgot to paste
[17:30:45] <robertmaxrees> *sec brb
[17:30:45] <makr8100> ffs I need sleep
[17:31:47] <makr8100> primitivMedia: I'm not seeing anything wrong with that, the nesting is correct
[17:34:04] <primitivMedia> i think i got it working
[17:35:59] <makr8100> glad we could try to help :|
[17:40:16] <primitivMedia> thanks guy
[17:44:36] <robertmaxrees> back for a few.
[17:45:12] <makr8100> He figured it out himself somehow then left lol
[17:45:22] <makr8100> It's close enough to 5 here, I'm off
[17:45:23] <robertmaxrees> without telling us the fix?
[17:45:29] <robertmaxrees> yikes.  and enjoy!
[17:45:30] <makr8100> yes, without telling us the fix
[17:45:38] <makr8100> "i think i got it working"
[17:45:45] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:45:46] <robertmaxrees> whatevs
[17:46:06] <makr8100> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:46:27] <robertmaxrees> "play 20 questions w/ me.  jk nvm."
[18:05:02] <diverdude> In the old codebase there is in the htmlfile a $(function() {...}); where they are doing:  some_variable = '{{ csrf_token }}'; `csrf_token` is a server defined variable which is available in the html file. I am trying to rebuild this codebase to a better standard, where i have all js code in js files, but how do i access that servervariable from inside js file?
[18:05:31] <robertmaxrees> you need to expose that token somewhere on the page.
[18:05:45] <robertmaxrees> it's not uncommon to have a global object that contains things like that.
[18:06:32] <robertmaxrees> or put that in a data attribute on your forms or whatever.
[18:07:14] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: ok so i make a global object inside a <script> tag on the html site and then i just reference it from within my js files?
[18:07:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  make a singular object with various props to hold your random global objects fwiw.
[18:09:06] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: singulat object? so like <script> let obj = {csrf='{{csrf_token}}'};</script> ?
[18:09:41] <robertmaxrees> const someDescriptiveName = { csrfToken = {{csrf_token}} }; etc.
[18:09:55] <robertmaxrees> and anything else you need globally should go on it.
[18:10:02] <diverdude> right ok
[18:10:25] <diverdude> const someDescriptiveName = { csrfToken = {{csrf_token}}, somethingelse ={{blabla}} }; ?
[18:10:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:10:34] <diverdude> ok cool
[18:10:36] <diverdude> thanks
[18:10:46] <diverdude> that makes sense
[19:52:05] <UJack> Aloha
[19:52:16] <UJack> I am using jquery to send form data to another page, using POST.
[19:52:51] <UJack> When I implemented datatables, my forms all broke and pass zero data. I realize this may be a datatables problem, but I am wondering the fundamental javascript under this that might cause this issue.
[19:53:31] <UJack> I am certain my function to execute the passing of variables from the forms happens AFTER the DOM is loaded, so why are the variables all blank all of a sudden when trying to augment datatables? What part of JS is that?
[21:00:17] <admin123> UJack: not sure what your issue is but I use datatables too
[21:00:37] <admin123> > I am using jquery to send form data to another page, using POST.
[21:00:56] <admin123> this is almost certainly not the case, you use js to send form data via POST to an api
[21:01:19] <admin123> you run datatables on a table not a form.
