[05:41:41] <Nertictrash> hello there
[05:41:56] <Nertictrash> is there anyone use jEasyUI for codeigniter ?
[14:05:40] <Wilfredor> hi, I'm trying search a form in a variable by id, but its not working
[14:05:59] <Wilfredor> $(data).find("#formid").length
[14:06:03] <Wilfredor> is allways 0
[14:06:21] <Wilfredor> but $(data).find(".my_span").length work perfectly
[14:09:45] <Wilfredor> https://jsfiddle.net/3r62xcgs/
[14:10:22] <Wilfredor> why form is allways 0
[14:10:25] <Wilfredor> I cant underestand
[14:28:44] <pavonia> Wilfredor: .find() searches through the element's children
[16:09:09] <taplar> everyone in my office is getting sick, :s
[16:09:16] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[16:09:30] <taplar> lol, it's like a plague is happening
[16:16:03] <robertmaxrees> drives me crazy when people don't stay home when sick.
[16:42:01] <Anthaas> Hi guys - What is the difference between these two? I can use Object.keys on the latter and get an array of length 1, using Object.keys on the former gets me an array of length 0 https://i.imgur.com/JUyI4wH.png
[16:42:14] <robertmaxrees> can you please make a fiddle?
[16:42:23] <robertmaxrees> instead of a screenshot of your dev tools :)
[16:42:50] <Anthaas> Haha - I keep being asked this, but I can't replicate it in a fiddle - its an interaction from Laravel through JS modules, and into Vue.
[16:43:28] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: without seeing actual code it's almost impossible to help heh
[16:43:48] <Anthaas> I'd happily do a screenshare to show it - I've tried making a fiddle for someone else and just couldn't replicate it.
[16:44:09] <Anthaas> There's clearly some difference in notation used to print the object - the {} vs {...} - I was wondering if that was a clue.
[16:44:14] <robertmaxrees> do a JSON.stringify on the object.
[16:44:16] <taplar> Rather than using Object.keys, console.log the JSON.stringify and see what the differences are
[16:44:20] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[16:44:22] <robertmaxrees> taplar+++
[16:44:26] <taplar> lol
[16:50:35] <Anthaas> taplar: robertmaxrees The output of console.log(myObj) and console.log(JSON.stringify(myObj)) are the same...
[16:50:56] <taplar> that's literally not possible, unless it's already a string
[16:51:16] <taplar> in which case trying to Object.keys() on a string doesn't make sense
[16:52:06] <Anthaas> Oh hang on - I had a lingering log statement.
[16:52:29] <Anthaas> Ok, so stringify prints: {}
[16:52:46] <Anthaas> How is it an empty object when it has things in it?
[16:52:46] <taplar> so it's an empty object
[16:52:50] <Anthaas> You can literally see that in the image...
[16:52:56] <taplar> it doesn't have elements at that point in time
[16:53:05] <taplar> so, point of clarification
[16:53:25] <taplar> if you console log an object to your browser console, and your logic changes it, your browser console will show you the up to date value of it
[16:53:50] <taplar> it is entirely possible that it is empty when you try are logging it, but later add stuff to it
[16:53:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd set a breakpoint via your debugger.
[16:56:28] <Anthaas> I am getting quite frustrated at myself for not being able to work this out :/
[16:57:17] <robertmaxrees> so what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[16:59:05] <taplar> and how does laravel/js modules/vue relate to jQuery?
[16:59:15] <Anthaas> Hmm, full disclosure - my front-end is Vue, not jQuery (but I was told here some time ago that "You can pretty much ask any JS question here - we are a lot friendlier than the folk at #javascript")
[16:59:26] <taplar> mmmmm
[16:59:30] <taplar> lol
[16:59:48] <taplar> you should still try to ask in the on topic room first
[16:59:51] <robertmaxrees> haha
[16:59:54] <Anthaas> I have haha
[16:59:54] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:59:58] <Anthaas> If you want me to go away, that's cool.
[17:00:09] <taplar> not saying that.  just pointing it out
[17:00:19] <Anthaas> Sorr
[17:00:20] <Anthaas> y
[17:00:43] <robertmaxrees> soooo use your debugger?
[17:01:12] <Anthaas> So - I am setting some translations in a blade template file onto window.MyApp.i18n.messages.
[17:01:37] <Anthaas> The issue is that when my mixin for my Vue component tries to access them, they are apparently not set?
[17:01:49] <Anthaas> Even though they are set _before_ my Vue component is even initialised.
[17:01:56] <Anthaas> (I just used the debugger to figure that out)
[17:02:41] <taplar> though, the thing you logged was {}
[17:04:06] <Anthaas> Hmm, I wonder if theres a simple way I can screenshare with you guys.
[17:04:12] <Anthaas> One sec, Ill try find an online thing.
[17:04:15] <taplar> where does you mixin get the data from?
[17:05:35] <Anthaas> I have a factory which accepts a locale and messages - both are provided from window.MyApp.i18n
[17:05:53] <Anthaas> the factory returns an instance of the mixin.
[17:05:56] <taplar> no, i mean, is the data set in a prop, or are you sputting it in the this.$store, or what?
[17:06:18] <Anthaas> Stored on window.
[17:06:44] <Anthaas> My mixin has functions which accesses them
[17:07:11] <taplar> err, i'm not an expert on vue so I'm going to ignore that for now
[17:07:29] <taplar> so, you are storing your data on the window
[17:07:35] <taplar> which you are loading with ajax?
[17:08:03] <Anthaas> No - haha - I'm setting it on window through blade :P
[17:08:14] <taplar> elaborate?
[17:08:34] <taplar> my "err" about the setting on the window, is typically you don't want to store data globally
[17:08:42] <taplar> that's part of the whole "component" thing
[17:09:07] <taplar> Vue has the Vuex that makes it majorly easy to share the dataModel with all the components
[17:12:12] <taplar> https://vuex.vuejs.org/ pzzzao~
[18:15:56] <Anthaas> Sorry about that - I got called away for food...
[19:20:56] <badcss> Hi all. Does anyone have any experience with masonry.js?
[19:23:16] <badcss> For some reason it's working on re-ordering all my div's except for when I click the first one. When I click the first div, it makes every other div stack on top of each other instead of rearranging the grid
