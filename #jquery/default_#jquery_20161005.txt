[00:00:24] <acidjazz> one last question
[00:00:38] <acidjazz> lets say i have a wrapper around my $.get or $.ajax that has its own general stuff it does when .fail fires
[00:00:42] <acidjazz> say its taplar.get()
[00:00:59] <acidjazz> is there a way i could pass along the .fail() that fires to my usage of it?
[00:01:02] <acidjazz> let me compile an example
[00:01:15] <taplar> so taplar.get() calls $.ajax() ?
[00:01:25] <acidjazz> it calls $.get() let me jsfiddle
[00:01:41] <acidjazz> https://jsfiddle.net/f484wnfq/
[00:01:41] <taplar> sure you could pass in the callback to the outer method
[00:02:12] <acidjazz> well i acutally pass the resposne to get itself, so i can use it and assign my own .always() and .done()
[00:02:30] <acidjazz> but now using your example id also like to intercept/add to the .fail()
[00:03:27] <acidjazz> i wonder if i can just return _this.fail(response) and also add jget.fail(repsonse0 ?
[00:03:29] <acidjazz> lemm esee
[00:05:56] <taplar> i'm having trouble visualizing this one, but i'm pretty sure the use of 'this' is wrong
[00:06:32] <taplar> the 'this' on ln 10 would either be the outer function or the object that it belongs to
[00:06:55] <taplar> or worse case the window, but in any case not a deferred for line 8
[00:07:41] <acidjazz> so all that does fire off genearl code i want to run fo revery ajax fail
[00:07:48] <acidjazz> and thats all owrking fine
[00:08:08] <acidjazz> for every ajax call*
[00:08:56] <taplar> huh
[00:11:28] <acidjazz> right so instead of $.get i use taplar.get which is that function
[00:11:34] <acidjazz> and i always have stuff firing i need to
[00:11:40] <acidjazz> but now we have this case, where i also want to do my own thing upon a fail
[00:12:14] <taplar> in addition to ln 8?
[00:12:16] <acidjazz> on top of of what taplar.get does when it fails
[00:12:19] <acidjazz> yes, ideally
[00:12:31] <taplar> iirc you can attach multiple fails
[00:12:51] <taplar> .fail(function1).fail(function2)
[00:12:56] <acidjazz> well in this cails only the first fail fires
[00:13:10] <acidjazz> let me verify
[00:13:37] <acidjazz> yea taplar.get().fail(function() {}) is not firing
[00:14:56] <acidjazz> i see
[00:14:57] <acidjazz> i got it
[00:15:21] <acidjazz> i need to call fail inside taplar.get()
[00:16:07] <acidjazz> like this https://jsfiddle.net/f484wnfq/1/
[00:16:31] <acidjazz> now lets make sure it works if i don tcall my own .fail()
[00:16:41] <taplar> or just attach it outside
[00:16:47] <acidjazz> bingo
[00:16:58] <acidjazz> ok so now i have the funcitonality required for your example
[00:17:04] <acidjazz> my own .yes() and .no()
[00:18:23] <taplar> coolio.  i'm fixing to hit the sack.  almost 24:00 here.  catch you later, :)
[00:18:47] <acidjazz> thanks again taplar, have a good one
[00:18:53] <taplar> you the same
[05:18:52] <nds_> what is the best practice for hijacking a form submit with jquery? some SO answers refers to depricated methods.
[05:34:23] <KnightsOfNi> How do you detect if a click is inside a div with other divs in it? Any of the sub divs should also be considered inside the main div and detect the clicj
[05:34:24] <KnightsOfNi> ?
[05:52:44] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: just bind a click handle on the div
[05:52:48] <Cork> click events bubble
[06:23:54] <Cork> eir: he's been spamming for days on end so have a look out for him if you remove it
[07:11:25] <shoky> always thought eir is a bot
[07:11:36] <shoky> spams my PM :|
[07:14:18] <Cork> ouch
[08:46:17] <localh0st> Hello! I've got a big table set by .html() function, I would like to render it before it's shown. Is it possible?
[08:48:10] <localh0st> Actually I've got loader icon in div, after I receive data from ajax's call I'm setting the div with the ajax's response (response is html table). It's kind of big and takes about 2 seconds to fully render the whole table in browser. Is it possible to make this 2 seconds delay smoother?
[08:58:08] <Cork> localh0st: there isn't a way to pre render out of tree elements
[08:58:36] <Cork> localh0st: if the table is that big you might want to look into a infinite scroll (or similar) solution
[08:58:37] <localh0st> Cork: thank, so I'll try to set html of hidden element and then I'll show it
[08:58:48] <Cork> so you don't load the entire table at once (as tables are very expensive to have in the dom)
[08:58:59] <Cork> localh0st: won't really make a difference
[08:59:08] <Cork> the cost comes from having the elements in the tree
[08:59:38] <Cork> localh0st: what you have do is parse the html into an out of tree variable
[08:59:47] <Cork> localh0st: and later on scroll insert/remove them from the dom
[08:59:54] <Cork> that way you would get much better performance
[09:00:19] <Cork> (you want to keep table rows below around 7-8000 rows)
[09:00:28] <Cork> if possible even lower
[09:01:19] <localh0st> Cork: yeah, I know how it would work, but I guess I need entire table to be always visible, it's view for the internal admin panel, the backend is in Java
[09:01:53] <localh0st> However, thanks for your idea, I'll see what the admins will really need
[09:02:03] <Cork> localh0st: why do you need to have it always in the dom?
[09:02:10] <Cork> you can't see all the rows as one time
[09:02:47] <Cork> and moving them in and out of the tree doesn't lose the element state as long as you don't throw away the old element
[09:03:02] <localh0st> Cork: because it's log file preview, some of the things are calculated right before it's shown in browser, I guess the would like to search for the items by "ctrl+f"
[09:03:26] <Cork> localh0st: ah, ya ctrl+f won't work; though you could provide a js filter in the page
[09:03:26] <localh0st> they would*
[09:03:50] <Cork> and that could show only relevant rows, so would be better then ctrl+f
[09:05:13] <localh0st> Cork: yes, as I said we will see that the guys will think about it, maybe the current thing is just fine for them, it would be just matter of performance adjustments :)
[09:05:34] <Cork> well and memory
[09:05:46] <Cork> big tables consume a crazy amount of ram
[09:05:58] <Cork> (and can cause chrome to crash :) )
[09:06:11] <decx> well having the fetched table in memory wont help with that
[09:06:21] <Cork> actually it does
[09:06:44] <Cork> moving the table out of the rendering tree into out of tree variables makes the browser able to handle ~80000 rows instead of 8000
[09:06:52] <decx> the trick is to have a backend that actually only gives you what you want, be it search or pagination
[09:07:52] <Cork> ya
[09:08:13] <Cork> that is what i normally do (the code i based the commend from was for csv client side import :) )
[09:08:59] <Cork> and it isn't fun to have to set a limit to how large csv files they can handle cause of bad table memory usage
[09:09:25] <decx> the solution is to put it in a pre instead ;)
[09:09:30] <Cork> and with full javascript and things it was originally as low as 500 rows :/
[09:09:39] <Cork> in a pre?
[09:10:11] <decx> it's a joke because a csv in a pre is just a string
[09:10:26] <Cork> ah
[09:10:44] <Cork> totally missed that one :/
[09:11:11] <Cork> it was really interesting though, didn't know moving the dom elements out of thee did that much for performance and memory usage before implementing it
[09:11:43] <decx> so you cache response in memory and then slice off 10
[09:12:09] <Cork> for what i needed i had form elements in each row, that the user might have modified
[09:12:17] <Cork> so i had to keep the full dom structure around
[09:12:47] <Cork> so i couldn't really cheat anywhere :)
[09:13:07] <Cork> else ya, storing the values in an array and basing it from that or similar is a really nice way to speed things up
[09:32:51] <localh0st> Cork: I used to work in the place where system was generating huge (really huge) CSV files, it was also able to generate PDF using PHPExcel. We had to set the PHP memory for single PHPExcel thread to 2GB, only it would allow them to using PDF
[09:33:34] <newbieBr> Hello, I have a problem with ajax request and same origin policy. I created a ajax request (jquery) to access an Instagram API Endpoint but the server response is blocking (Same-origin-policy). Does anyone know some solution for it? I also tried using crossDomain attribute as true, but it's not working...
[09:33:59] <localh0st> It of course didn't make any sense to use such a huge files because Excel or something was unable to operate on such big data sets, but guys from the office really needed this, ohh, that was crazy time, hopefully I'm not working there anymroe :D
[09:44:23] <verax5> hi guys
[09:44:38] <verax5> need lil help, how do i dump?
[09:45:07] <aftemark> Hello, anyone can suggest pure js or jquery based framework/lib/anything that will make forms development(like these http://oi66.tinypic.com/3zw2g.jpg) easier
[09:46:58] <localh0st> verax5: what?
[09:48:41] <Cork> verax5: what you're looking for is prob console.log or console.table
[09:48:56] <Cork> (not sure if console.table exist in all browsers)
[09:49:43] <verax5> yooo
[09:49:49] <verax5> where yall paste code man?
[09:50:20] <localh0st> pastebin.com
[09:50:21] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/tcnHQkCj
[09:50:32] <verax5> So I'm basicaly trying to get check box values..
[09:50:44] <verax5> these values are ids so i can then pass them to php script
[09:50:45] <localh0st> verax5: checkboxes works difference
[09:51:29] <verax5> so what does it return localhost?
[09:51:39] <verax5> when i do.   usersToDelete =  $("input[type=checkbox]").val();
[09:51:52] <aftemark> verax5: use $("input[type=checkbox]").each(function () { console.log($(this).val()) });
[09:52:01] <aftemark> the code u wrote wont do what u wanted
[09:52:58] <aftemark> so, anyone can help? plz suggest pure js or jquery based framework/lib/anything that will make forms development(like these http://oi66.tinypic.com/3zw2g.jpg) easier
[09:53:02] <localh0st> aftemark: however, will he get a checkbox values in Chrome using .val()?
[09:53:42] <aftemark> if its chechked i guess so
[09:53:53] <localh0st> I think he should use: usersToDelete =  $("input[type=checkbox]").is(":checked") ? 1 : 0;
[09:53:59] <verax5> damn thats so confusing lel
[09:54:05] <verax5> never seen such syntax
[09:54:09] <localh0st> because .val() didn't ever worked for me on Chrome
[09:54:33] <localh0st> verax5: it means: condition ? if true : if false;
[09:54:46] <aftemark> lawl
[09:54:55] <aftemark> for inputs .val() works perfectly
[09:56:36] <localh0st> verax5: if you want create the array with user's ids to delete, do what aftemark said before :)
[09:56:43] <Cork> verax5: what you want is var usersToDelete = $.map($(':checkbox:checked'), function(elm) { return elm.name });
[09:56:56] <Cork> that will give you a list of the checkbox names that are checked
[09:57:52] <aftemark> personally idk if he wants value of checked checkboxes or not
[09:58:08] <Cork> ya, it is a bit hard to say without the html markup
[09:58:23] <Cork> but ya, var usersToDelete = $.map($(':checkbox:checked'), function(elm) { return elm.value }); is an option
[09:58:26] <Cork> depending on what you want
[09:58:50] <aftemark> Cork: might you want to suggest me any pure js or jquery based framework/lib/anything that will make forms development(like these http://oi66.tinypic.com/3zw2g.jpg) easier &
[09:58:57] <aftemark> *?
[09:59:05] <Cork> aftemark: i don't think there is one
[09:59:25] <verax5> someone tell me what this is.. $(this)
[09:59:26] <Cork> aftemark: you might want to have a look at extjs
[09:59:30] <Cork> but donno...
[09:59:39] <Cork> verax5: kinda
[09:59:48] <Cork> verax5: $(this) is this, wrapped in a jquery object
[09:59:54] <localh0st> aftemark: extjs?
[09:59:54] <Cork> so $(this)[0] === this
[10:00:48] <aftemark> localh0st: iam asking
[10:00:59] <aftemark> localh0st: dunno what should i use
[10:01:01] <localh0st> aftemark: http://openui5.org/ is my second choise
[10:01:04] <localh0st> choice
[10:03:23] <verax5> okay obviously im doing this wrong, but why's there no errors? http://pastebin.com/ke7vtmuz
[10:04:43] <localh0st> verax5: http://pastebin.com/AuApCXQf
[10:04:49] <localh0st> paste this and take a try
[10:06:00] <Cork> you can't use each...
[10:06:10] <Cork> also please use jsfiddle.net
[10:06:10] <aftemark> why?
[10:06:19] <Cork> cause it doesn't return the processed value
[10:06:40] <verax5> this is so damn consufing man
[10:06:53] <Cork> verax5: what you want is the code i gave you a little while back
[10:07:03] <Cork> var usersToDelete = $.map($(':checkbox:checked'), function(elm) { return elm.value }); <--
[10:07:05] <aftemark> "processed value" what do you mean?
[10:07:31] <Cork> var variableName = $(...).each(...) is exactly the same as var variableName = $(...);
[10:07:38] <localh0st> aftemark: I guess he's telling about my check for the value :P
[10:07:42] <Cork> each doesn't modify the return values
[10:08:04] <aftemark> he wants to modify them?
[10:08:16] <verax5> i just wanna get checked values
[10:08:17] <Cork> he wants to collect them, not the elements
[10:09:16] <localh0st> aftemark: I think he's talking about references
[10:09:22] <localh0st> Cork: right?
[10:09:34] <Cork> no
[10:09:55] <localh0st> Ok, I'm giving up, I don't know what the problem is ;d
[10:10:18] <Cork> localh0st, aftemark, verax5: https://jsfiddle.net/4dzzcvgk/
[10:10:30] <Cork> THAT is what i think he is trying to do
[10:11:08] <Cork> alternatively he wants to keep the input name
[10:11:10] <aftemark> i think THIS xD
[10:11:11] <aftemark> $(':checkbox:checked').each(function () { console.log($(this).val()); } );
[10:11:24] <aftemark> just print damn valus in to log
[10:11:46] <Cork> ya, but i think that is for development, i don't think that is the end intention
[10:12:36] <Cork> but ya, there is too little data to do this without guessing so... verax5 would be nice if you could clarify this
[10:13:04] <verax5> I got this
[10:13:05] <verax5> <td> <input type="checkbox" value="{{$user->id}}" name="delete_users"/> </td>
[10:13:13] <Cork> verax5: modify the jsfiddle
[10:13:20] <Cork> click update and share the new link
[10:13:25] <verax5> I wanna get all the values, so i can send them to php to delete the users
[10:13:37] <Cork> verax5: have you checked the jsfiddle?
[10:13:48] <Cork> sounds like what it does is exactly what you want
[10:15:07] <verax5> oh it worked :)
[10:15:33] <aftemark> verax5: if its blade i guess its laravel just add [] to your checkbox name so its will be and get them in controller by foreach ($request->delete_users as $user) and so on
[10:16:06] <Cork> ya the input name is problematic
[10:16:46] <Cork> if you change that to have the [] at the end you could just use .serializeArray()
[10:17:47] <localh0st> Cork: aftemark verax5 it's exactly the same: https://jsfiddle.net/4dzzcvgk/1/
[10:18:12] <richardlampitt> Hello all - is this the best channel for google maps jquery questions?
[10:18:12] <Cork> localh0st: except you need to create the array out of bound
[10:18:20] <Cork> map results in a cleaner code
[10:18:50] <Cork> richardlampitt: for jquery ya, google map, no
[10:18:50] <localh0st> ohhh, he didn't even know how to use an array and you are trying to make him using a map
[10:18:53] <localh0st> :p
[10:19:05] <Cork> localh0st: ...
[10:19:42] <richardlampitt> Cork: Yeah, I'm a bit of a noob so unsure of where to ask. Just needing to get the map centre for some jQuery bits.
[10:20:07] * hlve slaps Cork with a trout.
[10:20:20] <Cork> richardlampitt: google map uses there own special api you can't use jquery with it
[10:20:44] <Cork> richardlampitt: so if you want to modify that you need to check the google api documentations
[10:21:03] <Cork> richardlampitt: if you want to center the element holding it, then you just need css
[10:21:19] <hlve> @richardlampitt, https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/
[10:21:19] <aftemark> richardlampitt: iam sure google maps api  has method for that purporse
[10:22:37] <verax5> yalll work with backend too?
[10:22:47] <Cork> ya
[10:22:55] <Cork> well not everyone in here, but some do
[10:23:47] <richardlampitt> cork, aftemark: Yeah, no doubt! My google fu is pretty weak presently. Thanks though!
[10:23:56] <aftemark> anyone tried making real time chat?
[10:24:15] <Cork> sure
[10:24:21] <aftemark> i made one with pusher but its not free after 1k messages a day
[10:24:35] <aftemark> what should i try?
[10:24:45] <Cork> you can use either webrtc if you don't want a central server
[10:24:52] <Cork> or you could use websocket (my preference)
[10:25:06] <aftemark> do i have to use some lib for that?
[10:25:17] <Cork> depends on what language the server is written in
[10:25:25] <aftemark> php ofcourse
[10:25:28] <Cork> but no both are native to "modern" browsers
[10:25:37] <Cork> php can't really handle websocket
[10:25:49] <Cork> as websocket creates a constant connection
[10:26:01] <aftemark> i thought websocket is js thingy
[10:26:11] <Cork> it is between js and the server
[10:26:18] <NoiseEee> aftemark: sure but it needs something running on the server to communicate with
[10:26:19] <aftemark> php onl sends request somewhere using curl o rsmthing
[10:26:22] <Cork> it is (as the name suggest" as socket
[10:26:25] <newbieBr> !help
[10:26:29] <NoiseEee> php has solutions like Ratchet
[10:26:50] <NoiseEee> but they only take moments to set up on Node if you're familiar with it
[10:27:09] <Cork> ya, my recommendation is to use go though
[10:27:19] <Cork> simple and very fast
[10:27:22] <NoiseEee> whatever floats the boat i suppose
[10:28:06] <aftemark> golang?
[10:28:12] <Cork> my problem is that node.js is among the slowest servers you can make
[10:28:14] <Cork> aftemark: yes
[10:28:19] <NoiseEee> Cork: ?
[10:28:29] <aftemark> so ratchet is not the way?
[10:28:41] <NoiseEee> aftemark: if you're comfy in php you can give it a spin, sure
[10:28:42] <Cork> aftemark: donno haven't looked into it
[10:28:48] <Cork> didn't exist when i started with websocket
[10:28:51] <aftemark> ratchet is node based?
[10:28:56] <Cork> no
[10:28:56] <NoiseEee> aftemark: no its php
[10:28:57] <Cork> php
[10:29:12] <NoiseEee> aftemark: the node based solution would be something like socket.io or similar
[10:29:19] <NoiseEee> aftemark: it is truly trivial to set up
[10:29:35] <hlvee> 11:11
[10:30:15] <aftemark> thx i wasnt wrong then thought that pusher is just a fraud
[10:30:34] <Cork> aftemark: it isn't fraud, it is just an old solution
[10:30:46] <Cork> it is what used to be the solution before websocket and webrtc existed
[10:31:06] <NoiseEee> also there's no need to run anything through anyone elses servers, which it seems pusher does?
[10:31:35] <aftemark> ok thx i think ill give it a try
[10:32:46] <aftemark> how many messages you think mysql can handle before it starts lag?
[10:36:15] <NoiseEee> aftemark: in terms of inserts and reads?
[10:36:34] <NoiseEee> aftemark: plenty, its designed for it... if that is truly your lag then you can always move it to its own server
[10:37:46] <aftemark> NoiseEee: 1 day i tried to select some data from 10k rows table
[10:37:54] <aftemark> it was pretty long
[10:38:22] <NoiseEee> aftemark: then that's because you had a bad query and/or your DB is not indexed properly
[10:38:33] <NoiseEee> aftemark: that kind of task should not register a blip of delay
[10:38:59] <aftemark> query was like select * where city_id=1 xD
[10:39:09] <aftemark> not much comlicated
[10:40:23] <aftemark> NoiseEee
[10:40:23] <aftemark> NoiseEee
[10:40:23] <aftemark> NoiseEee: what i want to know is it okay to store users chat messages in mysql
[10:41:01] <aftemark> NoiseEee: or should i start learnin NoSQL
[10:41:53] <NoiseEee> aftemark: thats up to you
[10:43:00] <NoiseEee> aftemark: but if you need relational data, mysql or a similar db should do fine.  they should not flinch at millions of rows in tables etc
[10:43:43] <aftemark> NoiseEee: thats i wanted to hear) thanks
[10:52:05] <hlve> 11:11
[10:54:51] <Qiller> hello friends, <div1> <div2>item</div2> </div1> function click div 1 --- function click div 2, can i click into div 1 (div2) and not trigger div 1 event?
[10:55:20] <Qiller> click into div 2, but dont active div 1 event?
[10:58:43] <AdamPDotty> In your handler (for div2) you write event.stopPropagation().

[11:11:16] <aftemark> NoiseEee: http://socketo.me/ this is ratchet right? i cant find any js lib to deal with data, there is only php implementation i guess? no js lib
[11:13:34] <NoiseEee> aftemark: yeah, hmm indeed it seems there is none
[11:13:56] <NoiseEee> aftemark: this example uses an explicit new WebSocket https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-quickly-build-a-chat-app-with-ratchet/
[11:14:24] <NoiseEee> aftemark: socket.io is really trivial if you already have a node server, a touch more involved if you need to set one up
[11:16:50] <aftemark> NoiseEee: thanks, this will help
[11:19:32] <GeekMonkey> Hey has anyone worked with Magnific Popup before?
[11:21:50] <verax5> Any idea why this wont alert or throw any error?
[11:21:50] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/PNdUiN5S
[11:22:00] <verax5> when i click the button it just submits to backend
[11:22:15] <verax5>   <button type="submit" id="deleteUser" class="btn btn-danger"> Delete </button>

[11:24:32] <GeekMonkey> Any ideas how I could pass the startT variable
[11:31:34] <richardlampitt> Hello all - is there a jQuery equivalent to php's similar_text function?
[11:31:42] <robertmaxrees> what does similar_text do?
[11:32:32] * hlve slaps robertmaxrees with a trout.
[11:32:38] <robertmaxrees> ah, song kind of percentage based thing.  not really.
[11:32:39] <richardlampitt> robertmaxrees: compares a couple of strings and gives a percentage of how similar they are
[11:33:09] <richardlampitt> Trying to compare a couple of addresses and discard them if they're similar
[11:33:34] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees: have you worked with magnific popup before
[11:33:37] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that kind of comparison work with jquery.
[11:33:51] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey nope but you can still as your question out to the channel and somebody might be able to help :)
[11:33:54] <richardlampitt> Righto. How come?
[11:34:08] <robertmaxrees> richardlampitt jquery's a froentend library. you want to do some basic data analysis.
[11:34:16] <robertmaxrees> much better job for your backend.
[11:34:40] <richardlampitt> Well, true. Fair. I'll see if I can't hack at the php that's producing these results then =]
[11:35:37] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KTKQVo_LvbM70SzMmnU
[11:35:37] <robertmaxrees> ;)

[11:35:52] <GeekMonkey> trying to pass the startT variable to the end of the src
[11:36:11] <robertmaxrees> uh
[11:36:18] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey are you trying to screenshare or something?
[11:36:37] <robertmaxrees> because that page is blank for me.
[11:38:59] <GeekMonkey> Shouldn't be
[11:39:02] <GeekMonkey> try again
[11:39:27] <robertmaxrees> still nothing.
[11:39:31] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KTKQVo_LvbM70SzMmnU
[11:39:35] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[11:39:41] <robertmaxrees> coupla refreshes fixed it.
[11:40:14] <robertmaxrees> errr., so you can'
[11:40:22] <robertmaxrees> *can't just insert a function into an object like that.
[11:44:10] <GeekMonkey> I know robermaxrees... I was just trying to show what I want to do
[11:45:21] <robertmaxrees> a cursory look at their documentation doesn't show any way to accomplish this using the native popup.  you might need to manually do it using .each()
[11:47:06] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/f6bc80beb307
[11:47:15] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i'd just comb through their docs.
[11:55:33] <verax5> this driving me crazy...
[11:55:39] <verax5> why th heck jquery throws no errorss
[11:55:52] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you're doing.

[12:01:17] <robertmaxrees>  what are you actually trying to accomplish here?
[12:01:26] <robertmaxrees> because your code doesn't really make sense?
[12:02:14] <verax5> getting all checkboxes first
[12:02:15] <verax5> 	var ids = $('input[type=checkbox]:checked');
[12:02:19] <verax5> then looping
[12:02:32] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing in the loop?
[12:02:37] <robertmaxrees> and whya re you returning false?
[12:03:00] <robertmaxrees> $.each(ids, function(index, elem){ should be ids,each(function(index, elem){
[12:03:20] <verax5> just so page doesnt submit
[12:03:43] <robertmaxrees> err, i mean inside the each
[12:03:57] <robertmaxrees> like... this really doesn't make sense.
[12:04:27] <robertmaxrees> $('input[type=checkbox]:checked').each(function(index) { console.log(index) });
[12:04:31] <verax5> just trying to get values..   <td> <input type="checkbox" value="{{$user->id}}" name="deleteUser[]"/> </td>
[12:04:59] <robertmaxrees> console.log($(this).val());
[12:05:51] <verax5> should this not return something aswell?
[12:05:52] <verax5> 		console.log(index);
[12:06:08] <robertmaxrees> it sure will, but you're returning false in to ma y place.
[12:06:10] <robertmaxrees> *places
[12:06:22] <robertmaxrees> are you not getting any console logs?
[12:06:55] <verax5> aint getting literaly nothing
[12:07:00] <verax5> sometimes syntax errors thats all
[12:07:12] <robertmaxrees> does #deleteUser actually exist.
[12:08:13] <verax5> ye i tried alerting it works
[12:08:52] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/rL0p3WN6
[12:08:53] <robertmaxrees> okay.  can you make a fiddle?
[12:09:09] <jquery741> Hello.
[12:09:15] <robertmaxrees> console,log($('input[type=checkbox]:checked').length) verax5
[12:09:21] <robertmaxrees> what does that give you?
[12:09:25] <jquery741> this not working ---> https://jsfiddle.net/aqvco77g/
[12:09:45] <jquery741> it should show "5" .. cause the day today is 5 october
[12:09:56] <robertmaxrees> jquery741 you can't compare dates like that
[12:10:17] <verax5> ive literallly spend 5 hrs
[12:10:18] <jquery741> robertmaxrees: okey how do I compare?
[12:10:22] <verax5> trying to get this shit done
[12:10:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery741 go grab a copy of moment.js and use that instead.
[12:10:41] <robertmaxrees> verax5 did you use the console log thing I just pasted?
[12:10:45] <robertmaxrees> console,log($('input[type=checkbox]:checked').length) verax5
[12:11:08] <jquery741> Ok
[12:11:09] <jquery741> thx
[12:12:02] <verax5> Well...
[12:12:03] <verax5> this. console.log($('input[type=checkbox]:checked').length);
[12:12:09] <verax5> returns nothing at all
[12:12:19] <robertmaxrees> so there's your problem.
[12:12:25] <robertmaxrees> do you want all checked checkboxes?
[12:12:40] <verax5> oh fk
[12:12:42] <verax5> oh fuckkkk
[12:13:38] <verax5> i checked the boxes this returns nothing
[12:13:39] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/VznKL8Ej
[12:13:46] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:13:50] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you?
[12:15:06] <verax5> well i check the boxed it should've returned something, maybe its an issue with html code
[12:15:35] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uebttyf9/
[12:15:43] <verax5>         <td> <input type="checkbox" value="{{$user->id}}" name="deleteUser[]"/> </td>
[12:15:45] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[12:16:05] <robertmaxrees> and is your table's markup valid?
[12:17:37] <NoiseEee> whats with the double {{ }} and php
[12:17:43] <NoiseEee> verax5: what is the *rendered* markup?
[12:17:50] <verax5> blade
[12:18:05] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:18:20] <NoiseEee> ahh
[12:18:28] <verax5> rendered
[12:18:29] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/RTuGR3sK
[12:18:52] <verax5> robers this one you liked doesnt seem to work https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uebttyf9/
[12:18:57] <drej> NoiseEee !! ltns
[12:19:12] <NoiseEee> verax5: that works fine
[12:19:32] <NoiseEee> drej: ++
[12:19:43] <robertmaxrees> verax5 that does work.
[12:19:52] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not filtering out console logs.
[12:20:02] <verax5> u see result when u click 'click' on roberts code?
[12:20:10] <NoiseEee> in the console log, yes
[12:20:45] <verax5> ohhh fkkkk
[12:20:54] <verax5> i have errors and warnings checked
[12:21:09] <verax5> thought console.log would still spit info
[12:21:14] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:22:34] <verax5> this is so strange...
[12:22:44] <verax5> wont show nothing in console in js tab...
[12:22:58] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're filtering stuff out.
[12:23:04] <verax5> ii know its idiotic but lemme restart browser..
[12:25:51] <verax5> i just installled firebug
[12:25:58] <verax5> and it shows the console.logs...
[12:26:13] <verax5> linux firefox is so stupid man
[12:27:25] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you turned off logs.
[12:28:34] <verax5> ive no idea how i did that then
[12:29:21] <robertmaxrees> go to the dev tools - click "logging"
[12:29:33] <robertmaxrees> make sue that's all checked.
[12:29:39] <robertmaxrees> *sure
[12:30:38] <verax5> where;s this tools you talk about robert?
[12:30:42] <verax5> is it console?
[12:30:48] <robertmaxrees> the developer tools?
[12:30:55] <robertmaxrees> the console, yeah.
[12:34:04] <verax5> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uebttyf9/

[12:34:25] <robertmaxrees> not that yo.
[12:34:34] <robertmaxrees> open the developer tools window itself.
[12:34:41] <robertmaxrees> go to console.
[12:34:48] <robertmaxrees> click the "logging button" under the tabs.
[12:35:36] <verax5> ohh, errors, warnings, info etc its all checked there
[12:35:49] <robertmaxrees> make sure "log" is checked, as well.
[12:37:41] <verax5> ye its checked
[12:37:47] <verax5> anyways fk that man ill just use firebug
[12:38:48] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:38:59] <robertmaxrees> no real need to use firebug these days, but ok.
[12:39:04] <robertmaxrees> fa
[12:39:07] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[12:41:43] <verax5> im trying to put values into array now
[12:41:51] <robertmaxrees> use .map()
[12:42:02] <verax5> got this so far
[12:42:03] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/xmDtqgzr
[12:42:11] <verax5> oh i thoguth it was .push method?
[12:42:31] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, but map is easier.
[12:43:26] <robertmaxrees> var myValues = $('input[type=checkbox]:checked').map(function() { return this.value }).get()
[12:44:13] <verax5> hmm need to use that in conjunction with each
[12:44:21] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[12:44:38] <verax5> hmm becaus eim using each to loop through it
[12:44:39] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/xmDtqgzr
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> right, why?
[12:44:52] <robertmaxrees> why are you looping at all?
[12:45:08] <robertmaxrees> are you just grabbing the values?
[12:46:35] <verax5> ye i just want values
[12:46:40] <verax5> then need to turn it into array so i can pass to php
[12:46:44] <verax5> using ajax
[12:46:47] <robertmaxrees> i just showed you how to do tht.
[12:46:51] <robertmaxrees> using map.
[12:51:05] <Darren_> rawafidsystems.com if you guys look at the svg map graphic on the banner, how could I animate it? Like I want it when you hover over the points it could do something, that something I am not entirely sure, I just want to know how I could have control to manipulate it
[12:51:35] <verax5> jus tried robert worked :)
[12:51:44] <verax5> jquery is pretty cool but a bit funny
[12:53:04] <robertmaxrees> why do yous say it's funny?
[12:53:52] <verax5> because of dom robert
[12:53:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:54:23] <robertmaxrees> so then the issue isn't with jquery?
[12:54:57] <verax5> some things are pretty strange like method chaining, using anonymous function in every thing, mnipuating dom with its api
[12:55:05] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:55:11] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to use anonynous functions.
[12:55:23] <verax5> btw what does .get() function do in the code you posted?
[12:55:23] <robertmaxrees> or method chaining.
[12:55:28] <robertmaxrees> in fact, I don't do either of those.
[12:55:42] <robertmaxrees> .get() in that case converts from a jquery object to a normal array.
[12:56:10] <verax5> this is it right?
[12:56:11] <verax5> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[12:56:28] <robertmaxrees> yep, but read the docs for $.fn.map instead
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/map/
[12:56:48] <robertmaxrees> "As the return value is a jQuery object, which contains an array, it's very common to call .get() on the result to work with a basic array."
[13:21:42] <taplar> i am taplar, destroyer of pipelines!
[14:03:22] <newbieBr> how can I make an ajax request to a search URL (like google.com/?q='abc') using a local javascript file with a workaround for Same Origin Policy?
[14:03:24] <robertmaxrees> https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.sc9m0njdm lol
[14:03:40] <robertmaxrees> newbieBr you'll need a local server to get around CORS
[14:04:11] <newbieBr> robertmaxrees: even if I use JSONP ?
[14:04:26] <robertmaxrees> newbieBr the other server has to support JSONP
[14:04:29] <robertmaxrees> google does not.
[14:04:39] <newbieBr> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to use jsonp but I got syntax error with the response
[14:04:41] <robertmaxrees> there's a big reason google doesn't want you to just grab their results to display elsewhere.
[14:04:50] <robertmaxrees> right, because google has to support JSONP.
[14:04:52] <robertmaxrees> which is doesn;t.
[14:05:06] <robertmaxrees> because they don't want you to display their search results elsewhere.
[14:05:22] <newbieBr> hmmm... It makes sense
[14:06:23] <newbieBr> So, one possible solution is create a single php file with "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" running in my local server?
[14:06:41] <robertmaxrees> back way up - are you just trying to learn ajax?
[14:08:04] <newbieBr> No. I've made a few ajax requests in my life... This isn't my first time.
[14:08:11] <robertmaxrees> then what are you trying to accomplish?
[14:08:42] <newbieBr> I'm trying to work with Instagram search results.
[14:09:57] <robertmaxrees> then you just need to setup a local dev server and go from there.
[14:11:47] <newbieBr> okay, I was wondering a solution without local dev server. But that's fine by me
[14:11:55] <robertmaxrees> for ajax requests, you'll need one.
[14:14:15] <newbieBr> thanks
[14:27:31] <bttf> hello, I'm doing a .ajax call with a FormData object set to the reuqest data. I'm setting contentType to false so that jquery will set the correct header (multipart/form-data) but it's defaulting to x-www-form-urlencoded. why would this happen?
[14:27:53] <bttf> since I'm uploading files, i'm expecting it to set contentType to multipart-formdata; boundary=---blahblah
[14:27:57] <taplar> processData: false too i believe is needed
[14:28:02] <bttf> did that as well
[14:31:57] <bttf> driving me nuts, dunno whati t could be
[14:32:37] <taplar> dunno, those two things as false, data as the FormData, and a post/put, should work
[14:36:32] <bttf> thank you taplar
[14:36:41] <bttf> it ended up being a wrapper method messing up my ajax params
[14:36:53] <taplar> ah, cool.  least you found it
[14:38:10] <bttf> thanks
[14:38:16] <taplar> all you man, :)
[15:25:11] <tomasm-> anyone know if theres some easy way to check if a variable is undefined or null or an empty list? I have some possible variables, that may or may not exist and if they do, they should be non-empty arrays. I just need something simple to skip if undefined or empty
[15:30:33] <tomasm-> ah $.isEmptyObject()
[15:56:25] <gmurop> I have an element $(el) who has two handlers bound to click and I want to unbind one of them with "off", the problem is that they were bound with anonymoys functions and I can't pass "off" as a second argument the handler name I want to unbind, how can I do?
[16:03:01] <robertmaxrees> gmurop check out namespaced handlers maybe?
[16:03:43] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just have a check in the one to see if it should actually run its logic or not.
[16:04:57] <gmurop> Both handlers are from third party libraries, but one of them are affecting the behavior of the other
[16:05:12] <gmurop> I just one to turn it off for one specific element
[16:05:16] <gmurop> want*
[16:05:24] <robertmaxrees> hummm
[16:05:32] <robertmaxrees> you're kind of sol at that point
[16:11:32] <taplar> can you give a name to an anonymous function after it's created?  i guess you just need a reference?
[16:11:52] <robertmaxrees> it's inside of a plugin though isn't it?
[16:12:07] <taplar> i was just thinking you could overload the jQuery.fn.on method
[16:13:27] <taplar> might be heavy handed, but could allow you to capture the provided callbacks
[16:14:39] <robertmaxrees> mmm.  that winds up modifying something you don't own to fix a weird problem.
[16:14:57] <taplar> yah, just thinking
[16:30:18] <taplar> i saw something disturbing today driving to work...
[16:31:14] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[16:31:17] <taplar> on the side of a truck: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/67/21/58/6721582d9900beae161b3ff8b030fa16.jpg
[16:31:20] <taplar> wtf man
[16:31:28] <robertmaxrees> WELP
[16:31:37] <taplar> seriously, lol
[16:44:34] <taplar> america, where the cows are the skinny ones
[17:42:50] * taplar has won his compatriots over
[17:43:14] <robertmaxrees> about?
[17:43:22] <taplar> gzipping static resources
[17:43:32] <robertmaxrees> wait you had to win people over for that?
[17:43:44] <taplar> *sigh* look, lol
[17:44:43] <taplar> i've said before and i'll say again.  i'm a grunt, ^_^
[17:44:52] <robertmaxrees> pfff
[17:45:22] <taplar> but they just saw a few moments ago approx a 1mb response compress to like 40kb
[17:45:28] <taplar> i won, :)
[17:48:00] <taplar> it was hilarious though, they were all ooohing and awwwing
[17:48:11] <taplar> and I was like, "yeah.  why have i been talking about this?"
[17:49:28] <taplar> may have to get ice cream tonight to celebrate the small victory
[17:59:20] <taplar> and i got that shallow clone for git to work on our pipeline, so it's been a great day, :D
[17:59:51] <taplar> yeah, fkin ice cream
[18:34:35] <Howdy_McGee> If I'm testing against this regex: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9 -._@]+$/` - - - Why are exclamations ( ! ) being allowed, it should fall out of bounds of the pattern.test()? https://jsfiddle.net/fuqw658v/1/
[18:38:06] <taplar> something to do with that -
[18:38:09] <taplar> it seems
[18:38:22] <robertmaxrees> -. is an ascii range iirc
[18:38:24] <Howdy_McGee> Would I need to escape the hyphen?
[18:38:29] <taplar> looks like it
[18:38:34] <Howdy_McGee> Hmm
[18:38:38] <taplar> single slash in front of it makes it work
[18:38:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:38:47] <robertmaxrees> -. would be ascii range 32 - 46
[18:38:52] <robertmaxrees> because - has special meaning iirc.
[18:39:02] <taplar> blank to period?  lol
[18:39:09] <taplar> err, space
[18:39:22] <robertmaxrees> lots of chars in there iirc
[18:39:28] <Howdy_McGee> I guess that works - I'll have to see what the special meaning of hyphens are.
[18:39:45] <taplar> it's acting like a range operator
[18:39:47] <taplar> 0-9
[18:39:48] <taplar> and such
[18:40:55] <Howdy_McGee> Ah that makes sense. Thanks taplar + robertmaxrees!
[19:34:40] <mukti> I'm having trouble when using a jquery ajax call; I'm probably doing something stupid.
[19:34:49] <mukti> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fb5bc4504c0dc5613503cd524de7b820
[19:35:09] <mukti> when I alert in the 'success' function, I see the string that I expect to have returned
[19:35:12] <robertmaxrees> because you can't return like that.
[19:35:23] <robertmaxrees> you can't return out of callbacks for ajax.
[19:35:55] <robertmaxrees> because they're async - the browser would have to lock up and wait for the ajax call to complete before continuing executing.
[19:35:59] <robertmaxrees> *execution
[19:36:54] <robertmaxrees> and even then - you're returing to $.ajax(), not to the calling function.
[20:31:11] <mukti> If I'm calling a .click at the end of my script, is there a way to pass the contents of the tag that was clicked? ex: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/653305d06317814b6f896d5fb87a4f10
[20:31:26] <mukti> (the "Value" in myFunction is the part I don't know how to do)
[20:31:53] <taplar> this.innerHTML
[20:32:02] <taplar> given your snipplet
[20:32:14] <taplar> you don't need the argument
[20:34:29] <mukti> taplar: oh
[20:34:44] <mukti> I didn't realize I could use 'this'
[20:35:23] <taplar> within an event handler, 'this' is the element processing the event
[20:35:25] <mukti> So if I put myFunction(this.innerHTML) it should be equivalent to myFunction(Value)
[20:35:33] <mukti> Okay, that makes sense
[20:35:43] <mukti> Don't know why I didn't realize that -_-
[20:35:53] <taplar> no, you don't execute the function when your give it to the binding
[20:36:39] <mukti> Not sure I understand
[20:37:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/peo0kwjc/
[20:38:17] <mukti> Oooohhh
[20:38:20] <mukti> Okay
[20:38:32] <mukti> thanks
[20:58:28] <mukti> taplar: that worked - thanks!
[20:59:37] <taplar> np
