[06:29:38] <pjanzen> Hi All, I am trying to get html data in a column inside a dataTable but all I end up with is [object object] printed the column. This is what I have so far https://gist.github.com/pjanzen/fbe3a6b0683be009d5f35db3874e497b (contains data, js and html)
[06:29:54] <pjanzen> I wonder if anyone could help.
[06:33:41] <krv> Hi guys. What is "fn" the abbreviation for? (I know it's a shorthand for the prototype property, but I like to know what it stands for – "function"?)
[06:39:24] <krv> No one? Can't find documentation about what "fn" is the abbreviation for … "function", I guess.
[06:40:38] <duderion> im pretty sure it stands for function
[06:47:26] <IamTrying> http://www.websocket.org/echo.html - when you press connect button, how long this connection stays connected? 24 hour / 48 hour when does it auto disconnect?
[07:04:02] <Cork> IamTrying: websocket doesn't close unless either part closes the connection
[07:04:07] <Cork> that is the point of a socket
[07:05:03] <Cork> IamTrying: the protocol has a ping action that each party uses to keep the connection alive
[07:05:39] <IamTrying> Cork: Guru, that is what killing us. We have A (server node), B (google chrome websocket), C,D,E...(google chrome websocket) client connected to A. Now B can connect D,E.. but B cant connect time to time with C even B / C and A can ping each others.
[07:05:59] <IamTrying> Cork: now the challenge i was assigned is to find why B and C cant connect time to time.
[07:06:12] <IamTrying> i am pulling all my hairs and cant find the cause.
[07:06:19] <Cork> connect time to time??
[07:06:33] <IamTrying> YES - Cork, let me draw you.
[07:06:58] <IamTrying> Cork = C , IamTrying = B, A = Server Node JS
[07:07:15] <IamTrying> B and C can ping each others and we are both online, also we are connected to A
[07:07:24] <Cork> uh
[07:07:27] <IamTrying> Now B can connect to all other D, E...
[07:07:33] <Cork> websocket doesn't connect between browsers
[07:07:40] <IamTrying> But when B attempt to connect C it fails
[07:07:53] <Cork> are you talking about webrtc?
[07:08:29] <IamTrying> Cork: CORRECT. WebRTC socket to Server but the signalling of WebRTC is using WebSocket
[07:08:51] <Cork> signaling... what?
[07:09:10] <Cork> webrtc is a protocol to connect between browsers
[07:09:15] <Cork> it has nothing to do with websocket
[07:09:30] <IamTrying> Cork: when B and C wants to connect they initialize webrtc signalling like hello, hi SDP sort of requests to server
[07:09:58] <Cork> the webrtc identifier needs to be submitted from each party so they can connect ya
[07:10:16] <Cork> but it still doesn't have any direct relation
[07:10:26] <Cork> the identifier can be send by snailmail if you like
[07:11:23] <IamTrying> Cork: identifier was sent/recv via WebSocket where NodeJS server is receiving it and broadcasting it to B, C. Where B and C fail time to time but after retrying within 20 to 50 seconds later same B and C can connect.
[07:12:40] <Cork> IamTrying: ya, but my point is the problem most likely has very little to do with websocket
[07:13:03] <Cork> it is most likely the webrtc that has problems finding a path or something like that
[07:13:38] <Cork> the reason i say this is that websocket is a very simple protocol
[07:13:49] <IamTrying> I was thinking that too Cork, but it will be then unresolved mistery if WebSocket is not responsible for this cause.
[07:13:51] <Cork> it isn't much more advanced then normal http
[07:13:58] <Cork> webrtc is a p2p protocol
[07:14:05] <Cork> and is much more unstable
[07:14:33] <Cork> you should break the problem down into its parts
[07:14:53] <Cork> start by ensuring that nodejs handles the message passing correctly
[07:15:31] <IamTrying> Cork: B ( iamtrying ) to A = OK ALL, C ( cork) to A = NOT OK all
[07:15:46] <IamTrying> that is why i am trying to trace the state of C WebSocket to A
[07:15:53] <Cork> IamTrying: your staring at too big part of the problem
[07:16:01] <IamTrying> OK
[07:16:06] <Cork> the problem has two parts
[07:16:19] <Cork> 1. the nodejs distributing the message correctly
[07:16:23] <Cork> and 2. webrtc
[07:16:39] <Cork> don't go from one client to end result in one go
[07:16:48] <Cork> you will miss the problem
[07:17:56] <IamTrying> Guru Cork, what do you suggest to find out the problem in C? Where B always work with others but time to time not with C
[07:18:29] <Cork> IamTrying: like i said, you should start by inspecting what the server does
[07:18:52] <Cork> and ensure that then the message comes in it locates the correct connections and pushes out the message there
[07:19:10] <Cork> also check if you have a reverse proxy somewhere
[07:19:13] <mooncup> $('input[name=categories[]][value ='+category.category_id+']').length
[07:19:18] <mooncup> can anyone tell me what is wrong with that selector?
[07:19:24] <Cork> that might close the connection cause lack of traffic
[07:19:33] <mooncup> I'm trying to select somehting with a name of categories[] and value of category.category_id
[07:19:36] <Cork> mooncup: quote variable content
[07:19:46] <R13ose> This code: http://pastebin.com/kP5kWEsK works, gets rid of the youtube video after I close the popup, on my desktop but not my mobile.  How do I make this work for mobile?
[07:19:52] <Cork> $('input[name="categories[]"][value="'+category.category_id+'"]')
[07:19:55] <IamTrying> guru Cork, server is doing pretty simple task receive from B or C and bypass here you can see for your information: http://paste.ubuntu.com/15945521/
[07:20:02] <mooncup> ok will give it a shot
[07:20:02] <mooncup> thanks
[07:20:47] <Cork> IamTrying: just cause the task is simple doesn't mean you can skip the step
[07:20:56] <IamTrying> OK
[07:20:57] <mooncup> working great
[07:20:59] <mooncup> thank you!
[07:21:09] <Cork> if the websocket is closing the connection is is cause of that code
[07:21:52] <IamTrying> Cork: you think my server causing it? when B, C does not work, at the same time B with others works
[07:22:20] <Cork> IamTrying: if as you state the problem is with websocket not working, then yes
[07:22:38] <Cork> though i still think the problem is with webrtc it is more likely
[07:22:39] <IamTrying> GReat, i got the direction guru thanks a lot Cork
[07:22:46] <Cork> but you should still not skip that part
[07:22:49] <Cork> as it is easy to verify
[07:22:54] <IamTrying> OK
[07:23:20] <Cork> just log what the server does and verify that it identifies the correct connections (by the websocket id)
[07:23:26] <Cork> and that it sends it correctly
[07:23:35] <Cork> after that log what happens in the browser
[07:24:06] <Cork> if that part works as it should, then you can exclude websocket from the problem
[07:28:39] <IamTrying> Cork: when i am checking the Browser WebSocket console. i can see a live webSocket connection is alive. When i made WebRTC call i do not see anything in that console. which means you are right the problem is not in WebSocket but in WebRTC?
[07:29:26] <Cork> IamTrying: you will have to analyze what you have there, don't jump to conclusions
[07:29:36] <Cork> make sure the server is sending the message correctly
[07:29:49] <Cork> and that the clients are getting them
[07:29:54] <IamTrying> OK - i am almost getting there now. Server is sending the message correctly i checked verified nothing is wrong in the server level.
[07:31:03] <IamTrying> Cork: clients also getting from server correctly no mistake. But what is going wrong is that WebRTC might not kicking itself to connect even though there is SDP informations given. And it execute the SDP details after a while that must be a new version BUG.
[07:31:58] <IamTrying> This problem also started recently so it must be something with new Google chrome version between v49, 50...
[07:32:38] <IamTrying> I will let you know how it goes just for your information. thanks a lot
[07:36:12] <R13ose> any thoughts on my question?

[09:06:30] <MassDebates> Hello! Quick question: Can I animate a border color change of an element if I'm using switchclass?
[09:12:21] <Cork> MassDebates: i think so, haven't used uis animations in a long time though
[09:12:38] <Cork> (you can do it with css3 transition btw)
[09:13:16] <MassDebates> I'm trying to animate a set of CSS border triangles on click
[09:13:44] <MassDebates> I'm already using jquery to change a numeric input with the click
[09:15:24] <MassDebates> I seem to have gotten the class switch right, but there's no gradual animation
[09:15:49] <MassDebates> I'm using switchclass because CSS border triangles are made with pseudo elements, which aren't a part of the DOM
[10:29:44] <helvetet> when working with cross domain, how do i make an ajax call to a crossdomain and let the crossdomain create a session? i partly solved it by doing xhrFields: { withCredentials: true} and adding "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true" to the header on the crossdomain
[10:29:57] <helvetet> but it forces me to set an allow-origin from a specific site
[10:30:14] <helvetet> and i dont really want to share cookies inbetween, i kinda just want the crossdomain to keep a session cookie by itself
[10:30:47] <helvetet> i used to do async crossdomain handling which allowed it but it got deprecated
[10:31:28] <helvetet> is there something inbetween withcredentials?
[10:44:50] <helvetet> nvm found out you could send session id's
[10:44:53] <helvetet> back and forth
[10:46:10] <joy4u> how to find the index of the number in an array which is greater than a number provided
[10:54:34] <taplar> maybe something like https://jsfiddle.net/5fwz1nqy/1/
[11:05:03] <decx> sounds more like a filter
[11:40:13] <Sal> is there a way to find a class on all elements except the this element and its children?
[11:40:59] <Sal> i mean, query all elements except the x element and all its children elements?
[11:41:18] <Sal> or do i need to loop thru all and che parent() ?
[11:43:28] <Sal> ok, i just found a way to exclude this   .not(this)
[11:43:43] <Sal> but how to exclude also this children?
[11:44:15] <taplar> maybe a filter checking for the parent
[11:44:44] <jquery051> a little problem here: http://181.224.135.163/~tommasom/node/add/rapporto-di-lavoro
[11:44:46] <jquery051> second page
[11:45:03] <jquery051> click on "scegli il livello"
[11:45:27] <Sal> taplar, if it was a class, i could do .not(".myClass *")
[11:45:29] <jquery051> if I select "altri" and click "Successivo"
[11:45:59] <jquery051> I should see the fieldset with id "altri", but it doesn't appear
[11:46:27] <jquery051> in console, if I write: jQuery("fieldset[id='altri']").show() it works
[11:46:40] <robertmaxrees> fieldset[id='altri'] lolwut
[11:46:44] <robertmaxrees> just do #altri
[11:47:01] <jquery051> I can't do #altri
[11:47:04] <jquery051> is parametric
[11:47:05] <taplar> Sal: try something like $().not(this).filter(function(){ return !$(this).parents(this).length; });
[11:47:09] <robertmaxrees> uh
[11:47:11] <jquery051> I have variable instead
[11:47:15] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs on a page.
[11:47:20] <taplar> crud, mixed this context
[11:47:34] <robertmaxrees> jquery051 so just use #
[11:47:35] <taplar> but you get the idea
[11:47:46] <jquery051> http://kopy.io/bJxd9
[11:48:03] <jquery051> this is the code for the "next" button
[11:48:15] <robertmaxrees> next_fs = $("fieldset[id=next_fs_id]"); yeah, just use #
[11:48:25] <robertmaxrees> also none of these vars are properly scoped.
[11:48:49] <jquery051> I need to change fieldset depending the radiobutton
[11:49:01] <robertmaxrees> you mean select a different fieldset?
[11:49:13] <robertmaxrees> because you can just do $('#' + theId);
[11:49:53] <jquery051> ok understand, it's for understand better the code
[11:49:59] <robertmaxrees> and also much faster.
[11:50:06] <robertmaxrees> and much clearer about what you wnat.
[11:50:08] <Sal> taplar, thanks
[11:50:13] <taplar> worked?
[11:50:32] <jquery051> the variable are initiated at the beginning of file
[11:50:51] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle of the issue?
[11:50:59] <jquery051> I tried
[11:51:11] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've got so far for a fiddle.
[11:51:13] <jquery051> but just copy and paste doesn't work
[11:51:27] <robertmaxrees> nor should it - you want a standalone test case instead :)
[11:52:15] <jquery051> well, if works for one fieldset, it will work for the others I still need to write
[11:52:38] <jquery051> but it you follow the steps I wrote is quite easy
[11:53:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you want a standalone test case instead.
[11:54:20] <robertmaxrees> that test page is huge and i'm getting warnings about not being authorized.
[11:54:48] <jquery051> check it one secodn
[11:54:56] <robertmaxrees> just make the fiddle, yo.
[11:54:59] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:56:07] <jquery051> strange, I'm using an anonimous tab for check it, it shouldn't have an authorization problem
[11:56:16] <robertmaxrees> dunno man.
[11:56:30] <jquery051> well, it's not that easy do the fiddle! :D
[12:18:39] <crucerio> many sites tell me to use google api jquery, does google offer this service to grab get hands on user-data?
[12:19:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:20:13] <robertmaxrees> i mean, they might grab some info about how fast things download, but it's really just a js file.
[12:20:21] <robertmaxrees> they're not, like, scraping for information.
[12:23:13] <crucerio> but still, if I transfer content using jquery from googles api it will be transferred over the google server?
[12:23:33] <robertmaxrees> it will come from google's CDN.  why are you so concerned about that?
[12:23:52] <crucerio> I wonder why google should offer this service for free
[12:24:01] <robertmaxrees> public service.
[12:24:22] <decx> it's in their best interest that js loads fast so people see more ads
[12:24:22] <robertmaxrees> get some data about download speeds.  might be a chance to test various optimizations. etc.
[12:24:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:24:27] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:24:33] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't worry about it very much tbqh
[12:28:16] <crucerio> I guess the best reason would be that it often already is in the browser cache placed by other websites
[12:28:37] <crucerio> so it doesn't need to be loaded again
[12:29:01] <robertmaxrees> eh, sort of.  there's such a disparity between which versions different sites use that i wouldn't really consider that to be a huge plus.
[12:34:41] <taplar> users are silly
[12:35:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:35:12] <robertmaxrees> hella
[12:37:55] <jfive> hello, please let me know if this should be a #javascript question instead, but: https://jsfiddle.net/Lv64dhcv/
[12:38:12] <robertmaxrees> you're not using any jquery in there sooo ;)
[12:38:16] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[12:38:38] <jfive> robertmaxrees: my console is open, good sir
[12:38:45] <jfive> but i'll ask over in #javascript, thanks
[12:38:59] <robertmaxrees> you have an error.
[12:39:11] <robertmaxrees> valuesArr[value1]
[12:39:17] <robertmaxrees> value1 isn't defined.
[12:39:26] <robertmaxrees> also, don't use new Array()
[12:39:34] <jfive> robertmaxrees: yes, but it shows there in the array does it not?
[12:39:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:39:53] <jfive> ahh yes i have it backwards
[12:39:54] <robertmaxrees> what do you expect that to do?
[12:39:57] <jfive> should be param1 not value1
[12:39:58] <jfive> woops
[12:40:04] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:40:09] <robertmaxrees> you're mixing arrays and objects.
[12:40:11] <jfive> https://jsfiddle.net/Lv64dhcv/1/
[12:40:24] <taplar> ["param1"]
[12:40:30] <robertmaxrees> but that's still not what you want.
[12:40:39] <robertmaxrees> oh hah derp.
[12:41:08] <jfive> ahh yes!
[12:41:13] <jfive> taplar: yes that was it: https://jsfiddle.net/Lv64dhcv/3/
[12:41:20] <jfive> taplar: thank you
[12:41:41] <robertmaxrees> also, valuesArr should just be an obejct
[12:41:43] <robertmaxrees> *object
[12:41:51] <robertmaxrees> i was tripping myself up there for a sec.
[12:42:19] <jfive> robertmaxrees: can i still obtain the value by name and not by number if i do it that way? i was having issues around that basically
[12:42:26] <jfive> by index name, i mean
[12:42:34] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:42:41] <taplar> isn't there a vanilla way to parse param strings?
[12:42:42] <robertmaxrees> there's no such thing as "index name"
[12:42:54] <jfive> robertmaxrees: i see :)
[12:42:55] <robertmaxrees> you either have array indexes or properties.
[12:43:09] <robertmaxrees> indices are actually property names with special rules.
[12:43:23] <jfive> robertmaxrees: ok so i guess the terminology is, i want to set the index to a named value and not a numerical value
[12:43:35] <robertmaxrees> "index" impliex numerical.
[12:43:39] <robertmaxrees> *implies
[12:43:45] <robertmaxrees> you want named keys.
[12:43:49] <robertmaxrees> hence an object.
[12:44:48] <jfive> robertmaxrees: is there a specific issue around why not to use new Array() like this?
[12:44:55] <jfive> browser compatibility or something?
[12:45:04] <robertmaxrees> new Array() provides a useless object wrapper.  just use the literals.
[12:45:08] <robertmaxrees> [] or {}
[12:45:17] <robertmaxrees> you want {} here.
[12:45:51] <taplar> and look into value.each()
[12:45:54] <taplar> *values
[12:46:04] <taplar> to get away from the for loop
[12:46:14] <robertmaxrees> *forEach()
[12:46:21] <taplar> ah, right

[12:47:26] <robertmaxrees> this is what i use for URL parsing.
[12:48:26] <jfive> ahh wow yes that is quite nice and succinct
[12:49:57] <jfive> looks it my doppleganger
[12:50:00] <jfive> -s

[12:50:50] <taplar> i need to watch those movies again
[12:51:22] <robertmaxrees> also: Johnny Five is similar to Jony Ive in name.
[12:51:24] <robertmaxrees> coincidence?
[12:51:25] <jonyfive> sorry, carry on :) thanks again for the advice taplar and robertmaxrees, have a deadline in 9 minutes but i will rewrite the for() loop out asap as well

[14:24:46] <pecg> I want to extract some attribute values on the <input> tags
[14:24:59] <robertmaxrees> .closest('tr').find('input')
[14:25:04] <robertmaxrees> .each() from there.
[14:25:35] <pecg> I already tried .closest, but I didn't used .each(), I missed it from the API
[14:25:55] <robertmaxrees> .closest() goes up to the parent tr.  .find() then gets the inputs.  .each() then enumerates.

[14:47:06] <pecg>  });y
[14:47:22] <pecg> This doesn't put anything to the log
[14:47:43] <pecg> Forget the last y
[14:47:43] <taplar> console.log( $(this).parent("tr").find("input") );
[15:22:41] <pecg> what if want to iterate over each element that matches the .find in: $(this).parent("td").parent().find(".valor-parametro"); ?
[15:23:08] <sdubois> how can get the next element of a selector that is NOT a <li>
[15:23:10] <pecg> I was trying: $(this).parent("td").parent().find(".valor-parametro").each(function(){...something...});
[15:23:26] <sdubois> next().not("li") doesn't work
[15:24:25] <taplar> pecg: make sure your find is actually finding elements
[15:24:54] <pecg> taplar: I'm sure it does find elements
[15:25:01] <pecg> But only gets the first one
[15:25:09] <taplar> you console.log'ed it and saw that the length was > 0?
[15:25:48] <pecg> Yes, I even was able to get attributes through .attr
[15:25:54] <sdubois> i might be going about this the wrong way. I want to select every anchor that does not have an <li> as the next sibling
[15:26:14] <taplar> then the each will work if it is finding element(s)
[15:26:53] <taplar> sdubois: try $('a').not('a + li')
[15:27:25] <pecg> taplar: how do I select each element (like in $(this)) inside the function of the each?
[15:27:54] <taplar> this inside the each is the current element in the results
[15:28:41] <taplar> or it is also a parameter passed into the each, which ever flavor you prefer
[15:28:42] <pecg> taplar: That would be $(this) or this?
[15:28:48] <taplar> either one
[15:29:05] <taplar> 'this' inside the each would be an Element, instead of a jquery object
[15:29:28] <taplar> so wrap it if you need the jquery functions
[15:33:12] <pecg> taplar: Perfect!
[15:33:21] <pecg> I don't how I missed that.
[15:33:28] <pecg> I could swear I already try it
[15:33:33] <pecg> *tried
[15:38:25] <FeyFre> guys, any known bridges jQuery<->GWT?
[15:39:54] <plccsd21> hi, can anyone suggest a html editor that has syntax checking, e.g. will tell me if i have more opening than closing tags?
[15:40:35] <taplar> sublime text might have that
[15:40:53] <taplar> if not by default it might have a plugin
[15:43:07] <plccsd21> ok thanks. a feature like that would just make working with large html/javascript pages easier :)
[15:43:42] <jonyfive> sublime can certainly help to that end... it has a feature under EDIT > LINE > REINDENT that will re-indent all of the selected code
[15:44:20] <jonyfive> it also has a feature where if you place your cursor in an opening tag it will highlight the closing tag... though i believe that comes from an extension i have iirc
[15:45:10] <jonyfive> no actually that second feature is by default also
[15:46:28] <plccsd21> im checking if there is a notepad++ plugin for that
[15:46:40] <plccsd21> thanks jonyfive , i will also have a look at sublime.
[15:49:09] <plccsd21> notepad++ highlights the closing tag by default (when the language is set to html=
[15:53:26] <taplar> i like the feel of sublime over notepad++, but hate the occasional popup
[16:22:05] <georgestephanis> @timmywil Ping when you have a moment to chat re: the quoted attribute selectors and such (#2824) [and/or anyone else who wants to talk about it]
[16:24:12] <georgestephanis> WordPress is working on a 4.5.1 point release aiming to ship early next week -- probably wouldn't be fully comfortable bumping a jQuery version in a point release of Core, but we're looking into a Migrate bump in the point release -- and I'm looking to see what would be involved on my part personally to try and get this situation covered.
[16:26:59] <johnnycadelco> hey guys got a few questions
[16:27:07] <johnnycadelco> here's my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/7pa7thfL/5/
[16:27:24] <johnnycadelco> i'd like to output the 3rd largest number in that array and then output the HTML
[16:27:46] <johnnycadelco> so far I've gotten only the max.. can you help me please on this issue?
[16:28:13] <johnnycadelco> the third larget should be the number 6
[16:28:25] <johnnycadelco> the result i'm getting is '67' from that array
[16:30:29] <taplar> should it not be 11?
[16:30:49] <taplar> 67, 15, 11, ...
[16:31:14] <johnnycadelco> hmmm
[16:31:22] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/7pa7thfL/6/
[16:31:34] <johnnycadelco> let me see
[16:31:57] <cannap> cheat :P
[16:32:06] * taplar shrugs
[16:32:18] <johnnycadelco> lol taplar
[16:32:29] <johnnycadelco> is 11 the 3rd highest number?
[16:32:37] <cannap> it start from 0
[16:32:45] <taplar> huh?
[16:32:50] <taplar> highest what?
[16:32:54] <taplar> there is no 0 in that array
[16:33:02] <cannap> no i mean 0 -> first etnry
[16:33:04] <cannap> entry
[16:33:37] <johnnycadelco> taplar: I meant is '3rd highest number' the same as '3rd largest number'
[16:33:38] <johnnycadelco> ?
[16:33:45] <taplar> lol, you tell me
[16:34:03] <johnnycadelco> lol yeah i believe so
[16:34:07] <johnnycadelco> ok so last one
[16:34:16] <johnnycadelco> how can I output the result in the HTML
[16:34:27] <johnnycadelco> like i want it in the div
[16:34:33] <johnnycadelco> so to spit out the text '11'
[16:34:53] <cannap> $('selector').html(number);
[16:34:55] <taplar> with or without jquery?
[16:35:00] <johnnycadelco> without jquery
[16:35:25] <cannap> no one knows!! :D
[16:35:50] <johnnycadelco> thanks cannap :)
[16:35:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/7pa7thfL/7/
[16:36:09] <cannap> but mine is with jquery
[16:36:14] <johnnycadelco> yes I know
[16:36:19] <johnnycadelco> i'm just saying thanks anyway ;)
[16:36:23] <johnnycadelco> taplar: thanks!
[16:48:49] <johnnycadelco> taplar: got one more for you
[16:49:01] <johnnycadelco> sry!
[16:49:03] <taplar> ho'kay
[16:49:10] <johnnycadelco> in https://jsfiddle.net/7pa7thfL/7/
[16:49:27] <johnnycadelco> how can i return the 'position' of the 3rd highest number in that array
[16:49:40] <taplar> you had to go there, :)
[16:50:06] <johnnycadelco> so instead of return the result just remove that and instead return the position ;)
[16:50:16] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/7pa7thfL/8/
[16:50:48] <taplar> hmm, hold on
[16:50:54] <taplar> sort may be changing the original array
[16:51:07] <johnnycadelco> ok cool
[16:51:46] <taplar> yeah, crap, hold on
[16:52:01] <johnnycadelco> ok no prob
[16:53:45] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/7pa7thfL/9/ <-- there we go
[16:54:17] <johnnycadelco> bingo!
[16:54:23] <johnnycadelco> thank you
[16:54:25] <taplar> if your wondering wtf, i just used slice to clone the array
[16:55:12] <johnnycadelco> i'm wondering where did you learn javascript lol
[16:55:17] <johnnycadelco> a class? or self taught
[16:55:30] <taplar> little kiddy with lots of free time, :)
[16:56:15] <johnnycadelco> haha ok
[17:03:50] <BenderRodriguez> johnnycadelco, code
[17:03:55] <BenderRodriguez> That's how you learn
[17:04:08] <BenderRodriguez> I've worked with CS graduates who were like babies
[17:04:14] <BenderRodriguez> couldn't code, couldn't handle themselves
[17:04:32] <BenderRodriguez> because they believed somehow getting that piece of paper saying they've graduated automatically makes them a competent programmer
[17:04:38] <BenderRodriguez> it comes as a practice.
[17:04:48] <BenderRodriguez> Not a pre-ordained gift from an institution
[17:06:32] <cvf> my jquery doesn't work https://dpaste.de/TvK0 because of https://dpaste.de/ZCkt selectFx.js am very new to js can someone help me?
[17:07:24] <johnnycadelco> BenderRodriguez: yea I see what you mean
[17:07:39] <johnnycadelco> I just wonder where to start.. I'm pretty good at HTML/CSS
[17:07:58] <johnnycadelco> self taught.. but when it comes to javascript i get stuck :/
[17:08:13] <taplar> johnnycadelco: personal opinion, figure out a side project you'd like to work on and start tinkering and googlin
[17:08:14] <johnnycadelco> so still trying to figure best place to start
[17:08:56] <BenderRodriguez> johnnycadelco, work on simple scripts. Research and create a way to take a user input from HTML, process it and provide an output
[17:09:00] <BenderRodriguez> then build a calculator out of it
[17:09:49] <johnnycadelco> alright guys thanks for the advice
[17:10:23] <cvf> hi
[17:10:28] <xnoxk_> someone have a good jsfiddle doing dropdown?
[17:13:37] <BenderRodriguez> xnoxk_, elaborate?
[17:14:10] <BenderRodriguez> you can google around and find many examples
[17:15:21] <cvf> my jquery doesn't work https://dpaste.de/TvK0 because of https://dpaste.de/ZCkt selectFx.js am very new to js can someone help me?
[17:15:40] <xnoxk_> BenderRodriguez: when click  Iwant the .container to dropdown https://jsfiddle.net/dd1h3thL/
[17:16:10] <xnoxk_> specifically on the top, without margin or padding on top
[17:16:23] <xnoxk_> and put it on the middle;on top;
[17:19:10] <taplar> xnoxk_: take a look at this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions
[17:20:25] <xnoxk_> taplar: I think that is too much
[17:20:36] <xnoxk_> taplar: can you work something out on my fiddle?
[17:21:12] <taplar> i could, but you wouldn't learn as much, :)
[17:21:26] <xnoxk_> I am not  a js dev
[17:21:29] <xnoxk_> though
[17:21:40] <xnoxk_> that is just something i gotta put together
[17:21:47] <xnoxk_> for this particular case i dont have much interess for js
[17:30:36] <taplar> we're a teaching room, however.  that's what we does.  we're not really about just providing solutions
[17:30:58] <taplar> we're not going to be the ones maintaining it.  you should be able to understand what your doing
[18:26:33] <Ungy> Hello all is there a way to limit an the each function to a certain number of occurances?
[18:27:04] <robertmaxrees> use https://api.jquery.com/slice/ to reduce the set first.
[18:29:01] <Ungy> hmm What I am trying to do is I have a table and I have a filter box that hides rows that do not match but I also have a row display number so I want to limit how many I turn visible. I guess I can count it in my function but I was hoping for an easier way
[18:29:25] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:29:29] <robertmaxrees> what?
[18:29:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:29:36] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want to use .filteR() then,.
[18:29:39] <robertmaxrees> *filter()
[18:30:27] <Ungy> $.each(s, function() { $('#' + table.name + ' > tbody > tr:visible > .indexColumn:not(:contains("' + this + '"))').parent().hide(); }); hmm OK I will look at filter
[18:30:41] <robertmaxrees> what is 's' supposed to be?
[18:30:56] <Ungy> var s = $(this).val().toLowerCase().split(" "); //show all rows.
[18:31:26] <Ungy> whatever I type into a textbox it filters all rows based on
[18:31:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use .filter() - invert your logic.
[20:47:44] <VectorX> is there a plugin that can detect a language such as html/javascript/ruby/php... etc when text is pasted into an editor or selected ?
[22:36:19] <drewery> so...
[22:37:51] <drewery> $('ul li.active').removeClass('active') vs $('ul li').removeClass('active')
[22:38:19] <drewery> is there really a big difference as far as practice goes, let's say I am building tabs
