[00:02:53] <sasori> hi, is this legal ? $("span.error").show(). ?or span is not recognized by jquery ?
[00:07:37] <Phelms215> try space in ebtween span and .error
[00:07:51] <Phelms215> and if that doesnt work simply do $(span).find(".error")
[00:08:14] <innociv_> How do I add arguments to a callback where the callback is called?  ie: myFunction = function(arg){ console.log(arg)}; do_then = function(callback) { callback('foo'); };  do_then(function(){ myFunction(); });
[00:17:08] <sgrover> Still no joy with IE 8.  No references to "default" anymore.  Tried to find a list of keywords with no luck.
[00:26:13] <sgrover> systemfault: thanks for the tips.  Got things partially running.  Using the IE9 dev tools showed that IE was complaining about an extra comma in an object declaration.  Removed that and things render right.
[00:26:22] <sgrover> NOW I can finish coding the thing.
[00:26:31] <systemfault> sgrover: A classic P
[00:26:34] <systemfault> Good :)
[00:26:46] <sgrover> yep.  Seen it many times.  I HATE IE.
[00:27:38] <Phelms215> hey, how do I make a function run every 10 seconds?
[00:29:29] <systemfault> Phelms215: setTimeout
[00:29:53] <systemfault> setTimeout(function() { alert('omg!'); }, 10000);
[00:32:01] <innociv_> http://jsfiddle.net/rqJPF/1/ How do I add arguments to a callback where the callback is called?  I've googled a bunch and can't figure it out. :|
[00:36:56] <shesek> innociv_, The arguments are passed to the anonymous function passed to do_then(), but you aren't passing it to myFunction
[00:38:04] <shesek> innociv_, Either http://jsfiddle.net/dpBxE/1/ for that specific case, or you could http://jsfiddle.net/dpBxE/2/ to pass all arguments
[00:38:40] <innociv_> Yes but I don't want them passed in do_then(function(){}), I want the argument set in the function itself.
[00:38:53] <systemfault> what?
[00:39:03] <innociv_> I just want the function supply by the last line, but the arguments set in the function itself
[00:39:39] <systemfault> I think you'll need to explain it better... or write an example.
[00:39:42] <innociv_> the /2/ was what Iwanted
[00:40:06] <innociv_> I think I explained it fine with the 3 line example. shesek got it.
[00:41:31] <systemfault> Not sure why he did .apply...
[00:41:36] <systemfault> and passed this..
[00:41:38] <systemfault> Anyway..
[00:45:08] <innociv_> Err.  The function I'm calling is in a class and it seems to be losing its "this" scope from that, actually..
[00:47:54] <systemfault> It should work if you pass the "this"
[00:48:15] <systemfault> also, perhaps jQuery.proxy might help.
[00:48:19] <innociv_> Oh, I guess I could get the class and pass that, but it's silly.
[00:49:56] <innociv_> I'll say this, though.  What I'm doing is I have some buttons, and clicking them calls a function with a switch since they each have some options in common.  The function with the switch makes a list, and only after something from that list is clicked does the function end.   So.. needing that pause while the user inputs something more made the callback required.  And, having the switch with different functions is why I need that supp
[00:49:56] <innociv_> lying a function in the callback.  Rather confusing.
[00:50:27] <innociv_> The other paste you gave works though, it just isn't intuitive when you look at it
[00:50:56] <systemfault> innociv_: http://jsfiddle.net/dpBxE/3/
[00:50:58] <innociv_> It appears it's simply a placeholder?
[00:50:58] <systemfault> If it helps
[00:51:54] <innociv_> Aye, yeah I knew that's what I'd need to do to make that method work.
[00:51:59] <innociv_> Both ways just seem weird to me.
[01:44:31] <sasori> is <textarea> equivalent to input.blahblah of jquery ? or it should be textarea.class ?
[02:17:58] <Adman65> hey
[02:18:19] <Adman65> is there some way I can trigger a "user selected an item" in an autocomplete manually?
[02:18:37] <Adman65> I'm doing some integration testing and need to be able to tigger it programmatically
[02:18:56] <Adman65> IE, given a value, select that value from the autocomplete
[02:28:01] <angelleye> I'm working with http://sandbox.usbswiper.com/usbswiper-low-transaction-rates.php.  I've got that flashing Mobile Swiper Coming Soon thing at the top, left.  I can easily find the CSS driving that div but I can't find the javascript (I'm assuming jquery somewhere in here) that's making it flash like that.  Any tips?

[02:32:56] <angelleye> thanks

[02:33:55] <koichirose> any tips for mine?

[03:57:15] <coldhead> maybe you can't animate the border color
[03:57:32] <coldhead> you might need the color plugin

[03:58:11] <bot-t> ;)
[03:58:17] <gnarf> is that like a plugin that gets you coors?
[03:58:45] <gnarf> there have been some bugs fixed since b1
[03:58:58] <gnarf> if you wanna try the beta, use whats on github / minify yerself
[03:59:24] <coldhead> that's what i was hoping bot-t would have

[04:00:35] <JamesTaylor> this is driving me crazy, i've search on stack overflow but found nothing. i'm using jqueryui autocomplete. It works fine until i try and use a custom tooptip, it then throws an error ".autocompelte is not a function"
[04:01:05] <gnarf> ?p @JamesTaylor
[04:01:06] <bot-t> JamesTaylor, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:01:17] <coldhead> you must be using a custom tooltip wrong
[04:01:18] <gnarf> also, sounds silly
[04:01:23] <coldhead> or a wrong custom tooltip
[04:01:28] <gnarf> but have you looked to see if $.fn.autocomplete exists?
[04:01:49] <gnarf> if it does, then whatever you're calling autocomplete on is not a jQuery object
[04:03:58] <JamesTaylor> thanks guys i will try and clean my code up and paste on jsfiddle :)
[04:04:23] <coldhead> thanks james taylor
[04:04:35] <coldhead> and keep up the smooth middle of the road adult oriented folksy rock

[04:10:38] <jbrokc> coldhead: i'm not - i just don't know how in this case
[04:13:54] <coldhead> oh i see
[04:14:05] <coldhead> i'm sad about the massacre in norway
[04:14:56] <gnarf> jbrokc: is "row" already a jQuery object btw?
[04:15:04] <jbrokc> gnarf: it's just a string
[04:15:13] <jbrokc> gnarf: "#foo" for instance
[04:16:20] <gnarf> function(row) { var elem = $(row); function animBg( color ) { elem.animate({ ....: color, ....: color, ..........}, 145); } animBg(...) animBg(....)
[04:16:33] <gnarf> one way
[04:18:08] <jbrokc> gnarf: wait what? can you paste that somewhere?
[04:20:14] <gnarf> jbrokc: https://gist.github.com/24203eccee7486435b88
[04:20:43] <jbrokc> gnarf: oh, i see. doesn't look too bad
[04:21:01] <gnarf> function calls take time in old ass browsers btw
[04:21:06] <gnarf> but whatever

[08:08:30] <Jonz> zulax, you want to center an absolute or fixed position element at the middle of the viewport?
[08:08:59] <zulax> for now just a small mini window that appears when the user clicks a button (instead of taking to the entire page)
[08:09:23] <Segaja> zulax: sounds like a job for jQuery UI
[08:09:43] <zulax> will look into it then, thanks
[08:10:04] <Segaja> zulax: look at the Dialog element of jQuery UI
[08:10:11] <zulax> ok
[08:10:21] <zulax> is it cross browser compatible?
[08:10:32] <Segaja> AFAIK
[08:10:45] <Jonz> its pretty straightforward:
[08:10:45] <Jonz> var x = ( $(window).width() + yourElement.outerWidth() ) / 2,
[08:10:45] <Jonz>     y = ( $(window).height() + yourElement.outerHeight() ) / 2,
[08:11:14] <Jonz> then … yourElement.css({top:x, left:y});
[08:11:21] <Jonz> maybe jquery-ui has an easier way of doing it
[08:11:34] <koichirose> Why can't I reselect 'name' here? http://jsfiddle.net/MjzGr/
[08:11:59] <Jonz> if it's absolute then you may need to also add the window.scrollTop or something, depending on what the nearest relative parent is

[08:39:49] <NielsMob> hello can someone help me with a TABS problem i have: http://jsfiddle.net/WqLK9/1/
[08:39:49] <NielsMob> I want to toggle <tbody> to be shown when i click on the tabs and created above code.
[08:39:49] <NielsMob> The <tbody> are correctly shown but the tabs are not switching to the selected tab
[08:45:33] <zulax> well, i put jqueryui js and css in same directory and included both in my page (as js and css)
[08:45:44] <zulax> and my jquery is actually on google server
[08:45:55] <zulax> doesnt look like that is working well,
[08:46:09] <zulax> how to do the installation?
[08:47:02] <dualcore> is there a public cdn for jquery ui or only jquery?
[08:47:30] <NielsMob> zulax: what is the head look like in you html code?
[08:49:42] <zulax> NielsMob, http://pastebin.com/MXNXEKMw
[08:50:45] <zulax> the closing tags are hidden
[08:51:55] <zulax> dualcore, http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jqueryUI
[08:54:27] <NielsMob> zulax: did you try this with firebird and firebug enabled?
[08:54:50] <NielsMob> maybe firebug tells you what is going one.
[08:55:16] <zulax> ok, i will try using googles cdn
[08:55:42] <zulax> that might take care of css
[09:00:03] <zulax> firebug says jQuery not defined for jquerUI.js
[09:00:17] <saddishwasher> so who in todays web browsing environment has js turned off on their browser?
[09:00:17] <zulax> is that a bug or is it installation problem from myside
[09:00:32] <zulax> saddishwasher, i do for every new i go
[09:00:36] <zulax> new site
[09:00:47] <zulax> and selectively enable js with noscript
[09:00:53] <saddishwasher> nowy
[09:01:00] <saddishwasher> no way
[09:01:34] <zulax> sure i do, it is safer
[09:01:47] <zulax> only turn js on for trusted sites
[09:02:11] <NielsMob> zulax did you also load the jquery self?
[09:02:36] <zulax> yes, it was already loaded from google cdn
[09:03:04] <NielsMob> can you please show the whole head section with load somehow there is the problem but with the snapshot i cant do anything
[09:04:26] <zulax> NielsMob, http://pastebin.com/PtUrSGYu
[09:04:32] <zulax> shouldnt that be all i need
[09:04:43] <zulax> maybe in opposite order?
[09:05:14] <NielsMob> indeed ;)
[09:05:39] <NielsMob> also load the css first and then the js's
[09:06:12] <zulax> well do i need to load the css too? i was hoping i didnt have to if i used public cdn
[09:06:26] <NielsMob> always
[09:06:35] <zulax> ok
[09:07:39] <NielsMob> so far i know is the public place only an easier way to have a up to date jquery.
[09:08:01] <NielsMob> but when they update you site can be broken,
[09:08:17] <deitarion> What's the cleanest way for me to pass something like "<div class="..."><ul class="..."></ul></div>" into something that generates a list of <li class="..."><a></a></li> structures and end up with them as children of the <ul> rather than as siblings?
[09:08:49] <zulax> ok
[09:09:01] <deitarion> (Ideally, I'd prefer to just do without the <div> and <a> parts altogether, but I'm piggy-backing on jQuery UI Tabs' CSS definitions and they're written to require them)
[09:12:18] <zulax> awesome, i can see the dialog box now with ui
[09:12:30] <NielsMob> ;)

[10:12:28] * ajpiano lols mildly
[10:17:24] <Viktor> hello, someone there?
[10:17:54] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[10:19:59] <Viktor> what do you think is best, usign jquery.js from https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js or include in the app?
[10:20:46] <Viktor> google: better cache...
[10:21:06] <ajpiano> Viktor: the best is to include it from google with a local fallback, like in html5boiilerplate
[10:21:34] <Viktor> ajpiano, great idea :D
[10:21:36] <ajpiano> https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/index.html#L52-54
[10:23:57] <Viktor> thx, I am trying to migrate a big banking website to jquery to avoid, at least, half the browser testing.
[10:24:29] <Viktor> but, you know, that is a delicate decission
[10:27:07] <Viktor> In your experience, how does jquery deal with old browsers like IE6 (thats not a browser..)?
[10:28:57] <ajpiano> it deals with it just fine
[10:29:12] <ajpiano> you still have to test your app in ie6 if you want to support ie6  though, jquery is not a magic bullet
[10:29:24] <Viktor> I was testing for two days and it was pretty well, but you never know...
[10:30:29] <Viktor> I thought that... but that's better that we have at the moment :D
[10:31:18] <Viktor> kilos of multibrowser code...
[10:32:37] <Viktor> any other advise for the future, about usign jquery in a banking app?
[10:33:03] <ajpiano> i would just say that like, don't assume that throwing just jquery at the problem is the best solution
[10:33:10] <ajpiano> if you are really refactoring the app from the ground up or something
[10:33:21] <ajpiano> you might want to consider using a framework on top if it
[10:33:48] <ajpiano> that offers code organisation, reuse, and loading paradigms
[10:34:12] <Viktor> loading paradigms?
[10:34:28] <ajpiano> script loading/dependency management
[10:34:32] <zulax> alright, this is taking me way too much time to figure out
[10:34:47] <zulax> doesnt jqueryUi natively allow confirmation boxes?
[10:35:01] <ajpiano> zulax: no
[10:35:06] <ajpiano> i mean... it depends
[10:35:18] <zulax> whats my easiest solution?
[10:35:18] <ajpiano> yes, jquery ui "natively" can do a "confirmation box'
[10:35:27] <ajpiano> but it will not be the same as the native browser window.confirm method
[10:35:34] <ajpiano> which is synchronous and waits for the user reply
[10:35:42] <ajpiano> whereas any custom modal dialog solution will have an evented approach
[10:35:53] <zulax> yesm that works, all i need is a yes or no
[10:36:03] <zulax> and if yes, i will need to make ajax calls
[10:36:30] <ajpiano> whatever you say
[10:36:34] <zulax> ajpiano, any reference pages i could look at for this?
[10:37:08] <zulax> I am looking at this but cant figure out why its not working for me http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-buttons
[10:37:14] <ajpiano> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/modal-confirmation.html
[10:37:41] <zulax> this is weired, in that page where is the code?
[10:37:59] <Viktor> ajpiano, thank you for your time :D
[10:38:23] <ajpiano> line 22 of the html page
[10:39:52] <zulax> well, how do i see what code produced that modal dialog
[10:40:16] <zulax> firebug :)
[10:47:05] <kryl> when I use click on div is it possible to use jquery code to activate a special mouse cursor like a normal link ?
[10:49:26] <ajpiano> use css
[10:49:42] <ajpiano> .somediv { cursor: pointer; }
[10:50:36] <kryl> thk u ;)
[11:00:39] <rhino> when hsing ajax to refresh a page/div, how can I keep the div's that were show/hidden w/ jquery on the initial page showing/hidden after the  jquery/ajax refresh?
[11:03:08] <kryl> and then when I click on a div how to simulate a normal link ? who will load gived url to browser ?
[11:03:44] <kryl> equivalent to window.location but in jquery ?
[11:06:23] <systemfault> What's wrong with window.location?
[11:08:20] <kryl> systemfault, nothing :) it's just to understand if there is equivalent !
[11:08:52] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[11:10:34] <systemfault> jQuery doesn't try to replace things that work well :)
[11:10:52] <kryl> ok ;)
[11:10:56] <kryl> thank you
[11:17:30] <Khellaz> how to make the current animation on element A to start after element B animation ends ?
[11:18:29] <Viktor> do you want to make a movie? (sorry, I am a jquery newbie)
[11:18:33] <Viktor> :D
[11:18:39] <Khellaz> :) no
[11:18:56] <Khellaz> they are notification messages
[11:19:11] <Khellaz> want to show them in sequience
[11:19:53] <ravenzz> ?animate @ Khellaz
[11:19:53] <bot-t> Khellaz, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[11:19:55] <Viktor> It seems the method animate has a callback funcion when is complete
[11:20:18] <Khellaz> Aha ok ,
[11:20:27] <Khellaz> fadeIn/Out also have
[11:20:39] <Khellaz> but I thought there might be an easier way
[11:20:41] <Viktor> complete: A function to call once the animation is complete.
[11:21:00] <Khellaz> yes , ok ,  thank you guys
[11:21:25] <Viktor> like you puts everything into a secuence...
[11:21:40] <Viktor> you could still do that :D
[11:22:40] <Viktor> with an array of animate function pointer ... (remember, I am a jquery newbie)
[11:24:15] <Khellaz> Viktor: ;) thanx
[11:58:24] <pifantastic> koichirose: because you never bind it to the click event
[11:58:34] <pifantastic> because it has .selected when the page loads
[11:58:48] <pifantastic> so $("#sort_by a").not(".selected").click() does not bind to it
[11:59:05] <pifantastic> 'nah mean bro?
[12:07:13] <drecute> hello
[12:07:26] <drecute> anyone used prettydate plugin recently?
[12:08:27] <drecute> i'm doing a simple window.alert(prettyDate('Sun, 24 Jul 2011 15:43:36 +0000'));
[12:08:43] <drecute> doesn't seem to work
[12:15:19] <pifantastic> drecute: you dont seem to be using it correctly
[12:15:27] <pifantastic> it doesnt define a function called prettyDate
[12:15:56] <EnginAy> I'm not convinced about returning HTTP Status error codes too on a failed Ajax API call. Instead I think it is better to return HTTP 200 and Sttus: FAIL in application level protocol.
[12:16:09] <EnginAy> because it leads to single point of control in the handler (instead of a succses handler and error handler
[12:16:15] <drecute> pifantastic: please how do I call it
[12:16:30] <EnginAy> any comment based on factual experience :)
[12:16:32] <EnginAy> ?
[12:16:39] <drecute> pifantastic: i'm using it as defined on JR's site
[12:17:23] <pifantastic> drecute: link
[12:17:24] <pifantastic> ?
[12:17:50] <pifantastic> I thought you were using the plugin from here: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-prettydate/
[12:18:01] <drecute> pifantastic: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-pretty-date/
[12:18:23] <pifantastic> drecute: you arent passing it the correct date format
[12:18:37] <pifantastic> ?eval new Date()
[12:18:38] <bot-t> pifantastic: <2011-07-24T19:18:35.837Z>
[12:18:45] <pifantastic> it's expecting that ^
[12:22:16] <gym_jane> hi all
[12:22:31] <gym_jane> i got some tabs which slide up and down divs
[12:22:56] <gym_jane> they animate smoothly but the div beneath just jumps and down
[12:23:19] <drecute> pifantastic: it says prettyDate not defined
[12:23:25] <gym_jane> how can i make the div changing its position with easing?
[12:23:54] <pifantastic> drecute: then it's not defined.
[12:24:02] <drecute> it is
[12:24:08] <pifantastic> apparently not
[12:24:33] <pifantastic> are you defining it *before* you use it?
[12:25:33] <drecute> pifantastic: see http://codepad.org/E21OJ9cW
[12:26:43] <pifantastic> drecute: prettyDate isnt defined there
[12:27:00] <drecute> pifantastic: how?
[12:27:12] <pifantastic> what do you mean how?
[12:27:17] <pifantastic> in that codepad
[12:27:20] <pifantastic> there is no
[12:27:26] <drecute> pifantastic: the file has been added to the top of the page
[12:27:33] <pifantastic> function prettyDate() { /* ... */ }
[12:27:45] <pifantastic> drecute: what browser are you using?
[12:27:51] <drecute> i mean jquery.prettydate.js
[12:28:00] <drecute> pifantastic: FF
[12:28:03] <hfrequency> howdy
[12:28:30] <pifantastic> drecute: are you sure the script is actually loading?  Maybe the path is wrong and it's actually loading a 404, ( you can check that with Firefox )
[12:28:41] <drecute> it is not
[12:28:44] <drecute> it is loaded
[12:28:50] <drecute> i will use jsfiddle now
[12:28:58] <pifantastic> drecute: Open a console and type "prettyDate"
[12:29:04] <hfrequency> I would like to contribute to the jQuery project debugging/testing effort. Where do I get started, and who do I have to talk with?
[12:30:24] <drecute> pifantastic: ReferenceError: prettyDate is not defined
[12:30:53] <pifantastic> drecute: can you paste the contents of jquery.prettydate.js?
[12:32:00] <drecute> pifantastic: sure
[12:32:04] <drecute> pifantastic: http://codepad.org/1KUMJFdC
[12:32:51] <Viktor>  I'm looking for a web developer (html/css/javascript) in uk(Milton Keynes), do you know a good place to ask for?
[12:33:01] <pifantastic> drecute: examples on how to use that are here: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-prettydate/
[12:33:04] <pifantastic> you are using it wrong
[12:33:12] <pifantastic> it's a jquery plugin
[12:33:52] <drecute> but it is really not appropriate
[12:34:12] <drecute> i have to put the value in title attribute before getting it out?
[12:34:22] <pifantastic> drecute: in that case, it's better to use John Resig's version: http://ejohn.org/files/pretty.js
[12:34:43] <pifantastic> you can see he makes a global function called "prettyDate" available
[12:34:55] <pifantastic> whereas the version you are using has been converted to a jquery plugin
[12:37:39] <drecute> pifantastic: ah thanks
[12:39:11] <koichirose> pifantastic, you're right. how would you solve it?
[12:39:36] <koichirose> maybe I could call click on it on page load..
[12:42:10] <drecute> pifantastic: i guess there's no difference then
[12:42:38] <drecute> though JR's version is available on the console
[12:42:46] <whateverb> Hi, does anyone know can GoogleBot run javascript?
[12:42:48] <drecute> but still returns undefined
[12:42:51] <Phelms215> hey guys, how would I setup a function to run every 10 seconds
[12:43:08] <kborchers> ?setTimeout @ Phelms215
[12:43:08] <bot-t> Phelms215, var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[12:43:27] <drecute> Phelms215: setInternal eval the function
[12:44:11] <Phelms215> i had window.setTimeout but it only runs once
[12:44:16] <Phelms215> it never repeats
[12:44:22] <kborchers> Phelms215: just write your function then use setTimeout inside to call itself after 10 seconds, then it will do so continuously
[12:44:43] <Phelms215> ok, so do like setTimeout(this, 10000);
[12:44:45] <Phelms215> at the end?
[12:45:11] <abiusx> Hello, I want to build and minify the Master release. I intend to use menus.
[12:45:15] <abiusx> Could someone please help?
[12:45:22] <kborchers> Phelms215: never used this there. just use the funtion name
[12:46:05] <abiusx> anybody there?
[12:46:40] <kborchers> abiusx: "Master release"?
[12:46:47] <abiusx> yeah the 1.9 version
[12:46:54] <abiusx> i want to have it like the minified version
[12:46:57] <iamjarvo> can someone explain to me whats going on with the show()[0] here please http://pastie.org/2264932
[12:46:58] <kborchers> you're talking about UI
[12:47:04] <abiusx> is there any pricess to "build" the release?
[12:47:13] <abiusx> yeah jQuery UI
[12:47:56] <hfrequency> abiusx: I don't know what the official tool is for minification, but jsmin is fairly popular
[12:48:11] <hfrequency> but it's written in C. What OS are you on?
[12:48:11] <kborchers> abiusx: not sure about that but you should not use that in production until it's released. i am actually still working on menu, it is not in its final state
[12:48:18] <abiusx> there are plenty of files which need to be mixed first.
[12:48:20] <Phelms215> @kborchers - TY! works beautifully
[12:48:27] <kborchers> Phelms215: np
[12:48:31] <abiusx> If you download the Master release, it has a build folder but i can't figure it out.
[12:48:47] <abiusx> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/zipball/master
[12:48:54] <abiusx> this download link
[12:50:46] <kborchers> abiusx: that is the most recent updated version of UI but it is not a release. like i said, not recommended to use in production which is why it's not minified for you. you should only use in development until an official release is made which means you don't need it minified
[12:51:16] <abiusx> I don't care if it's beta and not production version. i want to have and use it :D
[12:51:34] <abiusx> whats the process that the actual website uses for building features into the minified version!?
[12:51:36] <kborchers> plus, there is still more to menu that hasn't been added yet, i'm still building it ;)
[12:51:41] <abiusx> if you download the link i provided you might find clues
[12:53:43] <kborchers> i guess all i can say is good luck
[12:53:51] <jacof> Hey there. A theme I'm using loads jQuery in the footer. I understand that it makes the loading faster. However, my jquery scripts aren't defined when I put them in the content. Should I wrap my functions in some special container ? (on document ready perhaps?) Thanks
[12:54:48] <abiusx> textjQuery UI Release!
[12:54:48] <abiusx> 	Call task called 'deploy-release' to build a full release.
[12:54:49] <abiusx> 	The release built will be stored on 'dist' dir.
[12:55:52] <Phelms215> hey, when using the $.ajax with type: POST .. in the php file it points to what would be the naem of the POST ($_POST[namehere])  ?
[13:03:02] <madprops> why won't this work http://dpaste.com/576661/
[13:04:33] <abiusx> okay i went on with non minified version of it :)
[13:04:35] <abiusx> good luck
[13:04:36] <abiusx> :-
[13:04:37] <abiusx> :-h
[13:06:01] <iamjarvo> can someone explain to me whats going on with the show()[0] here please http://pastie.org/2264932
[13:09:01] <pifantastic> iamjarvo: jquery objects can be referenced as arrays
[13:09:11] <jacof> $("#toggle-view li") is null whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[13:09:17] <pifantastic> in that example, [0] returns the first DOM Element in the jQuery collection
[13:11:06] <iamjarvo> pifantastic: ah i see. so its basically finding the first one that has display block
[13:12:13] <boneheadj> Anyone familiar with an issue of not being able to get blank fields with .serialize because of value?
[13:12:59] <jacof> oh. noconflict
[13:13:13] <boneheadj> ?
[13:15:11] <boneheadj> Anyone?
[13:36:37] <sontek> I'm doing a .post() and I return a 400 with some json of the errors, but .error() doesn't seem to get my response content, so I can't display it
[13:36:51] <sontek> is there a way to tell .post to get the response from 400?
[13:38:32] <sontek> I see e.responseText but I have to eval() that
[13:39:58] <jacof> no one here
[13:42:47] <alix_> Hi everyone!
[13:43:14] <alix_> I have a problem with jQuery. Can someone help me?
[13:44:43] <alix_> I have a problem with jQuery. Can someone help me?
[13:45:02] <aghouseh> just ask away, there are usually plenty of people around to chime in with help
[13:45:44] <tbranyen> i am literally waiting with bated breath to assist
[13:45:52] <alix_> Each time I try to select an element, I get no result if this element has been created by jQuery after the page loading
[13:46:07] <tbranyen> alix_: did you add it to the DOM?
[13:46:22] <alix_> How do I do that?
[13:47:12] <alix_> How to add an element to the DOM?
[13:49:37] <duckspea1er> .append()
[13:50:16] <alix_> Yes, that's how  did
[13:50:45] <alix_> But if I do elem.addClass("myClass"), I am unable to get the class
[13:50:54] <alix_> It is the same problem
[13:54:53] <NielsMob> can someone help me with a TABS problem i have: http://jsfiddle.net/WqLK9/1/
[13:54:53] <NielsMob> I want to toggle <tbody> to be shown when i click on the tabs and created above code.
[13:54:53] <NielsMob> The <tbody> are correctly shown but the tabs are not switching to the selected tab
[14:09:09] <cook1es> Hello, when I use .show() on a div, the font on the website drastically decreases in quality, see examples: http://localhostr.com/files/O3Nc2wM/capture.png (hidden) vs http://localhostr.com/files/qLJKFhl/capture.png (.show(); ) any ideas?!
[14:15:59] <NielsMob> does that div use any different css/fond ?
[14:17:11] <cook1es> no NielsMob
[14:18:53] <malinens> What is proper syntax to replace every instance of text if in first parameter I want to add variable? replace("/new"+rowCountOld+"/gi", "new"+nFileRowCount); doesn't seem to work and without fancy regex it only replaces first instance
[14:20:16] <NielsMob> cook1es: not sure, i'm very bad in css stuff.
[14:20:47] <cook1es> NielsMob: I don't think it has anything to do with css?
[14:21:05] <NielsMob> did you try to use a element inspecter to see what is going on?
[14:22:41] <cook1es> NielsMob: Yes, no css changes other than the obvious visiblility: hidden/display: inline when using show() and hide()
[14:22:54] <Woet> ?demo @ malinens
[14:22:55] <bot-t> malinens, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:23:30] <malinens> found answer on #javascript : RegExp('new'+rowCountOld, 'gi')
[14:24:48] <poppiez> hi, I'm doing myContainer.children( 'div' ).bind( 'click', function() { console.log( this ); }); for some reason, when clicking on one of the divs, console.log() fires twice. why is this?
[14:25:44] <jacof> How can I .toggle to the right ????
[14:31:23] <stompyj> hey guys, is there a good canonical reference for javascript's prototype?  I know how to use it in practice, but I'm curious about the nitty gritty
[14:36:38] <EmoSpice> I'm attempting to launch an animation via click, but disable the button (or ignore further clicks on that button) while the animation is in progress. I don't want to interrupt the current animation. BlockUI seems huge for this task, and the method I'm seeing come up a lot (set global vars to true when the anumation starts and false afterward) aren't working. What is it that I'm missing?
[14:36:59] <operhiem1> EmoSpice: Can you present code or a test case please?
[14:37:02] <EmoSpice> Sure
[14:37:08] <EmoSpice> Lemme pastebin
[14:37:10] <|RicharD|> hi where i can start to learn jquery and javascript ?
[14:37:30] <|RicharD|> before js think :D
[14:37:31] <WeeJeWel> How do I select the first 8 childs of an element?
[14:38:04] <EmoSpice> operhiem1: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/445643/
[14:38:30] <EmoSpice> Yes - I'm replicating smoothScroll and scrollTo...I couldn't get them to work, so I reinvented the wheel
[14:39:00] <Engin> looks like if data type is 'json' .post() only runs success handler if {Status: 'OK'} and anything else it calls .post().error(handler). but it looks like it is not documented ?
[14:39:17] <EmoSpice> WeeJeWel: I think you should look over the slice() method.
[14:39:47] <EmoSpice> possibly each() as well, if you want to loop over the 8 returned items
[14:40:38] <operhiem1> EmoSpice: I'm not seeing anything evident.
[14:40:47] <EmoSpice> operhiem1: That's a raw cut/paste from my page. prev_in_progress is set globally.
[14:41:23] <operhiem1> As I assumed, but from the paste I'm not seeing anything that looks wrong to me. A test case on jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/) could be more useful though.
[14:41:55] <EmoSpice> Live version is here: bryanabennett.com/wedding/index.html
[14:42:21] <EmoSpice> I can definitely do a test on jsFiddle if the live version (with inline javascript) proves useless
[14:44:39] <operhiem1> The code you put on pastebin is not what I'm seeing on your live version.
[14:44:50] <nvictor> hey all
[14:44:55] <EmoSpice> Thought that might happen -_-
[14:45:01] <nvictor> is there a way to mock a server with jquery?
[14:45:01] <EmoSpice> Upping to jsFiddle
[14:46:07] <operhiem1> nvictor: $.get('/mypage/', { 'haha' : 'this server is stupid'} ); ?
[14:46:59] <EmoSpice> well played operhiem1
[14:47:07] <operhiem1> More seriously I've heard of Node.js, but I don't think it has anything to do with jQuery and I don't know if it will do what you want.
[14:47:13] <operhiem1> Do you have something more specific in mind?
[14:48:24] <EmoSpice> operhiem1: I reuploaded to my webhost, I'm afraid it won't work as expected in jsFiddle since I manipulate sizes of DOM elements based on window size
[14:48:32] <operhiem1> Ah.
[14:48:35] <nvictor> operhiem1: found something
[14:48:49] <nvictor> operhiem1: http://enterprisejquery.com/2010/07/mock-your-ajax-requests-with-mockjax-for-rapid-development/
[14:49:00] <nvictor> operhiem1: seems to be a library even, sweet
[14:49:49] <madprops> what's the easiest way to get the tail of a string, everything minus the first character?
[14:50:07] <operhiem1> madprops: substring(1) ?
[14:50:45] <madprops> operhiem1, cool i was trying (1,)
[14:52:24] <poppiez> hi, I'm doing myContainer.children( 'div' ).bind( 'click', function() { console.log( this ); }); for some reason, when clicking on one of the divs, console.log() fires twice. why is this?
[14:52:28] <IamTrying> When i submit possible to read the results? e.g: $('form').submit(function() {  // is it possible to read the submit results here? });
[14:53:27] <operhiem1> IamTrying: You need to register an event handler that takes arguments. http://api.jquery.com/submit/ ".submit( [eventData,] handler(eventObject) )"
[14:53:57] <operhiem1> poppiez: Do you have a test case? Is it possible that divs are overlapping?
[15:00:54] <operhiem1> EmoSpice: This seems to be working for me in that you can't scroll farther in the same direction; I think what you may want is a single move_in_progress instead of next_in_progress and prev_in_progress.
[15:01:32] <EmoSpice> really? double click the next or prev buttons...does it offcenter the main container?
[15:02:22] <EmoSpice> Becuase that's both what I'm seeing and what I need to prevent./
[15:02:38] <operhiem1> Aha, you're right. I was trying the tab names and hadn't noticed the prev/next arrows.
[15:02:43] <EmoSpice> ah
[15:02:50] <EmoSpice> That's a design thing that needs to be fixed >_>
[15:03:40] <operhiem1> How about instead of prev/next you have a pane index that is incremented or decremented with the target not being a screen forward or back but a multiple of the pane width?
[15:03:51] <operhiem1> prev() / next() I mean
[15:04:52] <EmoSpice> Could work, but double clicking it would cause the pane to shift twice, unless I'm mistaken
[15:05:01] <poppiez> operhiem1: as far as I can see there's nothing overlapping. weird this is, if I do $('.child-div').live( 'click', function() { console.log( this ); }}; it only fires once
[15:05:26] <nvictor> hmm how do i reference a jquery function?
[15:05:30] <operhiem1> EmoSpice: Sure. Is that what you're trying to prevent?
[15:05:32] <nvictor> or rather curry it?
[15:05:32] <operhiem1> nvictor $
[15:05:39] <operhiem1> nvictor: Hm?
[15:05:53] <nvictor> operhiem1: i need to reference getJSON
[15:06:02] <EmoSpice> Yep. I don't want the repeat click to register.
[15:06:18] <nvictor> operhiem1: with the response function and the url, already set
[15:06:28] <nvictor> operhiem1: if you know what i mean, like i'm currying or something
[15:07:40] <txt23> When I load jQuery UI from Google (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.14/jquery-ui.min.js) do I still need to load datepicker.js is would it be included with Google's CDN?
[15:08:00] <operhiem1> nvictor: http://www.dustindiaz.com/javascript-curry/ ?
[15:08:11] <tbranyen> nvictor: var myJson = function(arg) { return function() { var args = [].slice.call(arguments); args.unshift(arg); return $.getJSON.apply(this, args); }}}();
[15:08:14] <tbranyen> something like that
[15:08:15] <tbranyen> untested
[15:09:21] <nvictor> tbranyen: oulala
[15:09:33] <nvictor> looks intense :D
[15:10:35] <nvictor> tbranyen: apply doesn't actually call right?
[15:11:37] <dante1> Anyone mind helping with some noobish java work?
[15:11:44] <tbranyen> nvictor: yes it does
[15:11:46] <tbranyen> http://pastie.org/2265398
[15:11:49] <tbranyen> something like that perhaps
[15:12:17] <nvictor> tbranyen: better :)
[15:12:21] <nvictor> tbranyen: thanks
[15:15:21] <dante1> Anyone want to help with java? at all?
[15:15:48] <EmoSpice> I'd offer to help if I thought I knew enough anymore to help you :3
[15:16:03] <dante1> I could tell you more! lol
[15:16:08] <tbranyen> dante1: maybe #java ?
[15:16:08] <dante1> I need to scan this site
[15:16:17] <dante1> http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRICE3.HTM
[15:16:24] <EmoSpice> You need to scrape a site?
[15:16:31] <dante1> and need to write a program that takes a input
[15:16:37] <dante1> the input would be the name of a camera
[15:16:48] <dante1> and it would return, within the console, the next line of info
[15:16:59] <dante1> so for example, if someone inputted Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX9
[15:17:06] <dante1> in return, they would get
[15:17:11] <dante1> 16.2 megapixels, 5.00x Zoom
[15:18:02] <dante1> So far, I got my code from this site
[15:18:03] <dante1> http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/3553
[15:18:08] <EmoSpice> You're scraping a site. There are quite a few frameworks to do that. My favorite happens to be scrapy, if you know python. (assuming this isn't academic, because then that would be wrong >_>)
[15:18:33] <dante1> Well, it is academic, unfortunately lol, extra credit-ly academic
[15:18:41] <dante1> and I can only use java for it
[15:18:42] <dante1> :(
[15:19:12] <aghouseh> anyone know max image practices for mobile safari/android stuff?
[15:19:46] <operhiem1> dante1: jquery is not java. try #java
[15:20:54] <dante1> I tried #java, it said that its invite only. I figured someone in here might know java as well
[15:21:13] <EmoSpice> unfortunately, that's offtopic.
[15:21:18] <EmoSpice> I've pm'd you/
[15:21:22] <operhiem1> dante1: ##java
[15:23:15] <nvictor> java on invite only?
[15:23:19] <nvictor> lol :D
[15:23:57] <systemfault> Or just register your nick.
[15:24:08] <nvictor> i thought that
[15:24:22] <nvictor> usual thing on freenode
[15:26:29] <operhiem1> I'm having trouble with Firefox treating cache hits as 200s internally when it actually receives a 304 from the server. This becomes a problem when an AJAX GET request can return a false 200 with stale data. I can't think of a way to provide a test case easily, but I can continue working on it if it'd be useful. The same problem does not happen in Chrome or Konquerer.
[15:26:46] <Woet> operhiem1: do you want it to cache?
[15:26:51] <operhiem1> No.
[15:26:54] <Woet> else you could just append random data to the URL
[15:26:58] <Woet> ?no_cache=3487234723948194819
[15:26:59] <operhiem1> I include no-cache headers.
[15:27:00] <operhiem1> oh
[15:27:00] <bot-t> Woet, Couldn't find "no_cache=3487234723948194819" in jQuery Docs.
[15:27:04] <Woet> sorry bot-t
[15:27:05] <bot-t> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldazu28sVD1qdqv28o1_500.gif
[15:27:05] <Woet> :)
[15:27:36] <operhiem1> Woet: Thanks, that'd work. Seems somewhat of a less-than-ideal solution but worse things have happened.
[15:27:43] <Woet> operhiem1: it's quite common actually
[15:27:58] <Woet> i believe jquery itself does it too with a certain setting
[15:28:15] <Woet> 'If set to false, it will force requested pages not to be cached by the browser. Setting cache to false also appends a query string parameter, "_=[TIMESTAMP]", to the URL.'
[15:28:30] <Woet> operhiem1: boolean 'cache' for the ajax calls
[15:28:47] <operhiem1> Ooh nice.
[15:28:50] <operhiem1> Thank you.
[15:29:43] <txt23> Does jQuery have smooth scroll built in?
[15:30:44] <Woet> txt23: a smooth scroll for what?
[15:30:59] <txt23> Woet: For local anchor links
[15:31:17] <Woet> txt23: http://css-tricks.com/examples/SmoothPageScroll/
[15:31:19] <Woet> like that?
[15:31:46] <txt23> Woet: Yep :0
[15:31:55] <Woet> txt23: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/ should do it then
[15:32:24] <EmoSpice> txt23: there's a TON of plugins for that. It DOES have it, but a plugin makes it 100x easier.
[15:32:39] <EmoSpice> operhiem1: any ideas on my double click issue?
[15:32:41] <txt23> Woet: Will it work with latest version of jQuery?
[15:32:52] <Woet> txt23: on the demo it works with 1.4.3
[15:33:02] <madprops> is this how to retrieve data from a json object? $('#cname').html(data.channel.name);
[15:33:15] <Woet> txt23: i don't see anything in it's code that would break though, so i would just try it
[15:33:24] <Woet> madprops: yes
[15:33:33] <operhiem1> EmoSpice: I think my index idea would stop it from not aligning correctly, but I don't know why your variable check isn't working.
[15:33:44] <EmoSpice> txt23: http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[15:33:44] <txt23> Woet: Cool. Thanks man! Saved my day and searching on many sites :)
[15:34:02] <EmoSpice> I've not had much success, but you probably will.
[15:34:05] <Woet> txt23: i just did a google search on "jquery smooth scrolling" and linked you to the first hit, but you're welcome
[15:35:08] <EmoSpice> operhiem1: would the function return before the animation completed?
[15:35:16] <EmoSpice> phrased better - does the animation block?
[15:35:31] <operhiem1> It might not - do you have Chrome dev tools to test that?
[15:35:36] <operhiem1> Or firebug?
[15:35:57] <EmoSpice> I have both - I'm not terribly experienced with their JS testing capabilities.
[15:39:18] <Solean> Hi, i would like to remove tbody tags from a table before assigning my own thead and tbody. How do I do this? (the removing part i mean)
[15:40:36] <nvictor> what's the reverse of the function getJSON?
[15:41:07] <operhiem1> EmoSpice: I would suggest setting breakpoints after the animation call to see if you hit it before the animation is completed.
[15:41:26] <EmoSpice> Solean: look over the .remove() method. $("table tbody.remove_me").remove()
[15:41:42] <EmoSpice> operhiem1: I'm doing the same thing with an alert as we speak
[15:41:48] <Solean> EmoSpice:  I tried that but it seems to remove everything, including teh table data
[15:42:10] <EmoSpice> "table data"?
[15:42:17] <Solean> The table contents
[15:42:17] <EmoSpice> the table element?
[15:42:18] <Solean> the trs
[15:42:27] <EmoSpice> it will remove any children as well.
[15:42:32] <Solean> yes, I don't want that
[15:42:34] <Solean> Is there a way?
[15:42:40] <EmoSpice> Why do you need to inject the tbody?
[15:42:47] <EmoSpice> can you not just change the Css on it?
[15:42:54] <Solean> Trying to use tablesorter
[15:43:08] <Solean> which needs to have thead and tbody. the wiki that's generating the stuff doesn't let you put in theads and tbodies
[15:43:59] <EmoSpice> so - what's the html look like when you get it from this wiki?
[15:44:01] <EmoSpice> pastebin?
[15:45:19] <EmoSpice> operhiem1: it doesn't look like it blocks, In fact, I see my alert BEFORE the animation fires >_>
[15:45:21] <Solean> EmoSpice: this is what it looks like after generation, but browsers (i think) automatically put the rows into a tbody http://pastebin.com/GtGQBWPC
[15:45:34] <operhiem1> EmoSpice: Ouch.
[15:45:49] <EmoSpice> is there a sleep(x) function >_>?
[15:46:05] <operhiem1> EmoSpice: Can you register an event that will fire when the animation finishes? You could clear the "animation occuring" flag from there.
[15:46:16] <EmoSpice> good idea
[15:48:43] <operhiem1> EmoSpice: I also think you should have only one flag, not one for each direction.
[15:48:53] <EmoSpice> You're right.
[15:50:14] <EmoSpice> As a python programmer, these semi-colons will be the death of me
[15:51:01] <EmoSpice> Solean: .append() and a clever selector might be your best bet.
[15:51:18] <Solean> EmoSpice: can you remove stuff with append?
[15:52:02] <EmoSpice> If the html you pastebinned to me is right, you shouldn't have too
[15:52:07] <EmoSpice> s/too/to/
[15:52:12] <Solean> EmoSpice: Wait I meant that I was fine with putting in the thead and tbody, but the browser automatically generates a tbody around the tr
[15:52:14] <Solean> s
[15:52:39] <EmoSpice> so why do you need a new tbody? use the one the browser generates.
[15:53:23] <Solean> EmoSpice: because I also need a thead for the first row
[15:53:41] <Solean> EmoSpice: I can't put the thead inside the tbody tag that the browser generates unfortunately
[15:54:41] <EmoSpice> I have no idea.
[15:55:17] <Solean> Yeah it seems like such a small thing =/
[15:55:18] <EmoSpice> read the data into an array, call remove() and repopulate the table with the data using append()?
[15:55:21] <EmoSpice> >_>
[15:55:57] <Solean> hahaha xD I guess I could... but at that point it might be easier editting th wiki source lol
[15:56:10] <EmoSpice> Probably
[15:58:29] <madprops> is there anything wrong here? the request comes out ok but when i try to show the data it doesn't show
[15:58:35] <madprops> http://dpaste.com/576763/
[16:01:35] <madprops> im sending data like this 	data = {'cname': channel.name, 'post':post}
[16:01:57] <madprops> cname is a string
[16:04:56] <EmoSpice> operhiem1: fuggin genius. The callback function to unset in_progress works awesomely
[16:05:08] <operhiem1> Hooray! I'm glad it's working.
[16:05:37] <EmoSpice> Now I just need content, and I might just have a wedding site to show the fiance :3
[16:05:47] <EmoSpice> (and some design tweaks)
[16:06:30] <cook1es> hello, I have divs with id #spoiler_X where X is a number, is it possible to style all, with a CSS selector like a joker-sign or something?
[16:06:48] <cook1es> Hello, when I use .show() on a div, the font on the website drastically decreases in quality, see examples: http://localhostr.com/files/O3Nc2wM/capture.png (hidden) vs http://localhostr.com/files/qLJKFhl/capture.png (.show(); ) any ideas?!
[16:07:02] <cook1es> above was wrong message
[16:07:15] <cook1es> the first one, the second is correct :D
[16:19:28] <operhiem1> My code doesn't run with an "uncaught ReferenceError: data is not defined" in line 85. I don't understand why, as it seems identical in form to the others that don't have such errors, and JSLint comes up clean. Code is http://dark-code.bulix.org/t9ziv7-80317
[16:22:39] <Aquaguy> Hello.
[16:26:06] <Aquaguy> I have an array of td elements $(table tr td); is there any way to get the text of each td inside of an array? I've tried doing $('table tr td').text() but it's concatenating everything
[16:26:31] <vepsen> operhiem1: guessing data, status, jqXHR is not defined, try writing  success: messagePaneHandler, without the (..)
[16:28:02] <vepsen> aquaguy: var arr=[]; $("table tr td").each(function(){ arr.push($(this).text())}
[16:28:59] <operhiem1> vepsen: If I do that, the handler isn't passed any arguments. Should I try defining them inline?
[16:29:28] <operhiem1> Oh without () even
[16:29:55] <vepsen> oper: yea, you are not pasing those yourself, that is handled by jquery :)
[16:30:06] <Aquaguy> vepsen, thank you
[16:30:13] <operhiem1> vepsen: Hooray, it works! Thank you.
[16:30:15] <vepsen> np
[16:30:25] <vepsen> oper: change that in your other methods aswell
[16:30:47] <operhiem1> Done.
[16:30:53] <vepsen> cool :)
[16:51:02] <daveyjoe> Does $.animate use CSS3 transitions where possible?
[17:00:55] <Aquaguy> I'm a little bit lost. I've an array of 'n' array elements arr = [[1,'Some name'],[2,'Hey there'],[3,'Blah blah'],...]; I'm tryng to sort those text elements alphabetically and know the new order 3,2,1 in this case.
[17:01:57] <Aquaguy> I know that .sort() sorts the array alphabetically but I dont know the order
[17:02:34] <operhiem1> Aquaguy: By know the order you mean determine the previous position in the list? What are you using that for?
[17:03:26] <Assimilater> i suspect I have a syntax error, but firebug isn't showing me anything, and yes I have the console enabled, is there any other reason that code execution could stop halfway through?
[17:03:42] <coldhead> ?jshint @ Assimilater
[17:03:42] <bot-t> Assimilater, http://jshint.com/
[17:03:53] <Aquaguy> operhiem1, I'm trying to sort some tr elements, when the user clicks on a th element it orders alphabetically the table by that column.
[17:04:37] <operhiem1> Ah. I'm surprised you weren't able to find a library function for that. Any particular reason you're reinventing the wheel?
[17:05:36] <coldhead> you can't (easily) use sort() for that
[17:06:44] <Aquaguy> operhiem1, I can't use 3rd party code but the jquery library itself
[17:08:49] <DyanneNova> Hi, I'm looking for some help with a slide down menu, this is the code I'm using, but once it's styled there's a bug where it slides up and down repeatedly while hovering over the items in the drop down menu
[17:09:09] <DyanneNova> sorry, here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/LL8ud/
[17:10:01] <coldhead> Aquaguy: are you passing a function to sort() which controls the sort order?
[17:14:48] <Aquaguy> coldhead, nope
[17:18:30] <vepsen> think it would be easier to do this server side if you can't use any plugins.. tablesorter at http://tablesorter.com is a good client side jquery addon for that
[17:30:07] <madprops> what is wrong with this? this makes no sense http://dpaste.com/576812/
[17:30:15] <madprops> the alert never shows up
[17:33:45] <coldhead> ?mdc sort @ Aquaguy
[17:33:46] <bot-t> Aquaguy, sort - MDN Docs - Sorts the elements of an array in place. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[17:44:40] <egeste> is there a jquery ui element that functions like a set of resizeable panes?
[17:47:44] <Aquaguy> var siblings = $('#someID').siblings();
[17:47:57] <Aquaguy> now how can I get the 3rd sibling?
[17:48:10] <coldhead> ?eq
[17:48:10] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[17:48:18] <coldhead> .eq(2)
[17:48:33] <Aquaguy> thanks
[17:48:55] <Aquaguy> what does eq stands for?
[17:49:09] <coldhead> good question
[17:50:23] <coldhead> equivalent?
[17:57:17] <egeste> is there a jquery ui element that functions like a set of resizeable panes?
[18:02:49] <imsky> egeste: http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos.cfm
[18:04:49] <ekkis> anyone here using the LiveID API?  I'm getting an error that I'm missing the access token

[18:08:03] <Whirl3d> Hey all. How goes it this find evening?
[18:08:09] <Whirl3d> *fine
[18:08:10] <Whirl3d> lol
[18:08:12] <ale_> Hello, I am making an app which plays with the widths and heights, but when I press Ctrl + make zoom in or zoom out, the values are not fine, how can I prevent the div to expand it's height when the user makes zoom in?
[18:08:36] <imsky> Whirl3d: sup mayyyne
[18:08:53] <coldhead> that's not something you can control, ale_
[18:08:55] <Whirl3d> imsky, cool as ever I suppose. How you beeeeen?
[18:09:03] <imsky> haha
[18:09:07] <coldhead> it's like user supplied style sheets
[18:09:08] <imsky> this weekend's been pretty good
[18:09:16] <imsky> i'm working on some slickgrid stuff right now
[18:09:19] <ale_> coldhead: there's a hack with css
[18:09:20] <coldhead> it's a matter for the user, they can fuck your shit up if they want
[18:09:34] <Whirl3d> down with users!
[18:09:55] <Whirl3d> slickgrid? is that a plugin or a typo?
[18:10:04] <imsky> plugin
[18:10:10] <Whirl3d> cool. I'll have to check it out.
[18:10:12] <imsky> https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid
[18:10:23] <imsky> lol down with users?
[18:10:45] <Whirl3d> I know, I get carried away sometimes.
[18:10:52] <imsky> haha what happened
[18:11:50] <Whirl3d> Okay, my roommate is doing the entire Mommy Dearest dialog at the top of his lungs right now. wow
[18:12:54] <Whirl3d> I usually think ahead to have the parental filters prohibit him from seeing it, but somehow it slipped by me
[18:14:15] <Whirl3d> Does anyone know the modulo incrementing solution that makes it so you don't have to check for limits? It's something simple like x=(x+1)%total  or something..
[18:14:49] <imsky> 0_o
[18:14:51] <imsky> long day, huh
[18:15:39] <Whirl3d> If you consider about 72 hours and 300 cups of coffee a long day, sure.
[18:16:14] <imsky> not bad
[18:16:22] <imsky> my average is usually 302 cups of coffee
[18:17:06] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I used to do more, but since I started smoking meth, I just don't have as much time to fit as much coffee in.
[18:17:13] <imsky> i know right
[18:17:16] <Whirl3d> lol
[18:17:17] <imsky> and what about the sex?
[18:17:20] <imsky> just gobs of it
[18:17:28] <imsky> can't a guy catch a break?!
[18:17:53] <Whirl3d> And you'd think I'd be all skinny and shit, Meth just makes me eat faster, I swear
[18:18:02] <Shai-Tan> can I have two script with a jQuery(document).ready(function($) on the same page?
[18:18:08] <imsky> Whirl3d: lolol
[18:18:13] <imsky> Shai-Tan: yes
[18:18:21] <Shai-Tan> imsky: thanks
[18:20:32] <ale_> Does anyone know a hack of a canvas element that when the user zooms in the browser, the canvas element expands "widthly" and not "heightly"
[18:21:04] <imsky> i think that should be a couple of lines of jq, ale_
[18:21:32] <tbranyen> ale_: like with the zoom feature built into the browser?
[18:21:34] <tbranyen> because uh
[18:21:40] <tbranyen> thats really really not something you can hook into
[18:21:57] <DyanneNova> Can anyone help with a slide down menu? I'm having trouble with it occasionally bouncing instead of staying slide down
[18:21:57] <ale_> yes, when you press ctrl + or ctrl -
[18:23:06] <jaypitidi> $(document).load(function() { $('.loader').setTimeout(300); $('.loader').hide(); });    ---- Can anyone tell me why this isn't hiding my div with class=loader?
[18:23:10] <jaypitidi> after 3 seconds
[18:23:38] <ale_> any ideas??
[18:23:43] <Whirl3d> jaypitidi, try using a comma, not a ; in your timeout
[18:24:10] <Whirl3d> $(".loader").timeout(300, $(".loader").hide()); ?
[18:24:40] <Whirl3d> sry   try var t=setTimeout($(".loader").hide(), 3000);
[18:25:24] <jaypitidi> thanks
[18:25:41] <Whirl3d> wow. I need some sleep. Try t=setTimeout(function () {$(".loader").hide();}, 3000);
[18:26:23] <imsky> that meth is killing you
[18:26:52] <Whirl3d> Ben alman is killing me.
[18:26:57] <Whirl3d> Does he know everything?
[18:27:19] <imsky> short answer: yes
[18:27:21] <Whirl3d> I mean, every time I need something done in jquery and google it, his name is at the top of the list and he always has an elegant solution
[18:28:05] <imsky> what did you find now?
[18:28:12] <Whirl3d> doTimeout
[18:28:23] <imsky> oh yeah
[18:28:26] <imsky> oldie but a goodie
[18:28:57] <imsky> probably should be part of jquery ;)
[18:28:58] <Whirl3d> It's funny, but I have small library of ben alman scripts that I include by default on a webpage.
[18:29:04] <Whirl3d> I was about to say that
[18:36:50] <Whirl3d> seriously, no one knows how to use % to avoid limit checks. It's such a simple formula and I can't quite get it. No short term mem...what was I saying?
[18:39:36] <imsky> limit..checks?
[18:40:27] <Whirl3d> (x+1)%max helps you to avoid if x>max then x=0;
[18:40:55] <imsky> hmm
[18:40:59] <imsky> check out #programming, maybe
[18:42:04] <mattalexx> If I have two element variables, is there a way to combine them into one?
[18:42:19] <Whirl3d> I got it finally. It's var x=(x+1)%max   or x=-(x-1)%max
[18:42:26] <mattalexx> As if I had written a serlector that matched all of the elements in both
[18:42:39] <Whirl3d> $(variable, variable) ?
[18:44:18] <mattalexx> Whirl3d, Should have known. Thanks
[18:59:06] <Whirl3d> how do you select an img element that is not visible? $("img").not(":visible") ?
[19:00:51] <coldhead> $('img:hidden')
[19:00:52] <jaypitidi> Whirl3d: how can I add a fadeOut effect to setTimeout(function () {$(".loader").hide();}, 3000);
[19:01:08] <jaypitidi> that works great btw
[19:10:55] <afeijo> hi all
[19:11:06] <afeijo> is it possible to use ajaxForm() and livequery()?
[19:11:36] <coldhead> it should be, afeijo
[19:12:07] <afeijo> I have a form that I bring to my page thru AJAX, so I have this line to add ajaxForm to it: $('form#export-form').livequery('ajaxForm', function() {});
[19:12:52] <coldhead> can't you just apply ajaxForm() when you load the form?
[19:13:05] <coldhead> via the success handler for whatever you load the form with?
[19:13:39] <afeijo> coldhead, I can, but I thought it would be beter with livequery
[19:13:39] <mwhudson> hi, i want to do an ajax tab, which is easy, but the server wants to return text/plain, so i want to have some code to process what the server gives into dom nodes
[19:13:44] <afeijo> I'll try it now
[19:13:48] <mwhudson> is there an easy way of doing this?
[19:14:38] <coldhead> afeijo: i prefer to do it in the success handler because someone else reading your code later sees it all in one place "ah, so here she loads in the form... and then oh right, she adds ajaxform... cool"
[19:15:27] <afeijo> coldhead, well to prevent attacks we would need a lot more than that :)
[19:15:39] <coldhead> mwhudson: if you can get the text into a var then just $(var_name).appendTo('#wherever') should suffice
[19:16:00] <coldhead> the place to prevent attacks is on the server
[19:17:04] <afeijo> coldhead, so you're against using livequery or only when it envolves forms?
[19:17:20] <coldhead> livequery isn't very much used anymore
[19:17:25] <coldhead> it's good for some things
[19:17:31] <coldhead> and don't let me tell what to do
[19:17:41] <coldhead> if you prefer livequery and ruby on rails then BY ALL MEANS
[19:18:00] <coldhead> success handlers are the simple/obvious way for me
[19:18:35] <afeijo> coldhead, I'll go with what works, my approch wasnt, yours did it :)
[19:22:41] <afeijo> coldhead, btw thanks! :)
[19:22:47] <coldhead> you're welcome, babe
[19:22:53] <afeijo> :p
[19:24:43] <Whirl3d> jaypitidi, sorry I was away. You could use .fadeOut(time) in place of hide()
[19:25:14] <Whirl3d> jaypitidi, var t=setTimeout(function () {$(".loader").fadeOut("fast");}); would work
[19:27:22] <Whirl3d> is there an event that happens when you attach an element to the dom that you could use .live with?
[19:27:59] <jaypitidi> Thanks. my problem now is if I set .loader to display=none; in css the I can't get it to show. I wan't it to be none in case users have disabled js
[19:28:47] <jaypitidi> i did $('loader).show(); but it doesn't work
[19:29:03] <Whirl3d> $(".loader").css({display:"block", opacity:1}).delay(3000).fadeIn("fast");
[19:29:14] <Whirl3d> Not sure about .delay, lemme check
[19:29:53] <Whirl3d> should work. Makes the loader visible, waits 3 seconds, fades it out
[19:30:57] <Whirl3d> coldhead, thanks btw. Can't believe I even asked about :hidden. duh.
[19:31:39] <coldhead> no problem, Whirl3d. it's only my first day using jQuery
[19:31:46] <coldhead> just found out about serializeArray
[19:31:51] <Whirl3d> yours too?
[19:31:52] <coldhead> #noon
[19:31:56] <coldhead> #noob*
[19:33:29] <jaypitidi> yea im not sure why it isn't working. it still will not show. should I make the style in the html rather than my css file?
[19:33:59] <Whirl3d> jaypitidi, post some code on jsfiddle and I'll look at
[19:34:21] <jaypitidi> ok thanks
[19:34:49] <Whirl3d> maybe you could attach the loader using jquery/javascript. That way it won't even be present without javascript
[19:36:09] <jaypitidi> oh ok, how would i go about doing that?
[19:36:44] <jaypitidi> that method would be easier for me because I have a lot of pages that need this loader
[19:44:00] <Whirl3d> sorry, I was eating potato salad. LOL
[19:44:08] <bbrandon> rFOLOLO
[19:44:40] <Whirl3d> You would create the loader in an invisible div then when you need it append it to the container you are loading
[19:45:11] <jaypitidi> ok thanks i'll look up how to do that
[19:45:31] <Whirl3d> $(".loader").css("opacity",0).appendTo($("#loadTarget")).fadeIn("fast").delay(3000).fadeOut("fast");
[19:45:55] <Whirl3d> or use an event to call the fadout function once the page has completely loaded
[19:47:47] <Whirl3d> Or what I usually do is wrap a div around my container where I load my divs.
[19:48:14] <jaypitidi> so loadTarget would wrap the content I need loaded?
[19:49:18] <Whirl3d> Yeah, let's say you are loading .page elements <div class='outer'><div class='loader'></div><div class='inner'><div class='page'>sme content</div></div></div>
[19:49:43] <Whirl3d> then all of your pages load in the "inner" class and your loader is a sibling
[19:50:15] <madprops> can i get the text of a link, between <a> and </a>?
[19:50:26] <Whirl3d> $("a").text()
[19:51:06] <madprops> cool
[19:56:19] <jaypitidi> ok maybe it would be best if js created a div with id="loader" and appended it to #loadTarget and then hides it after the timeout with fadein and fadeout methods respectively, how would i do that?
[19:57:07] <jaypitidi> I appreciate all your help and I hate to ask so many questions, I'm just not that great with javascript
[19:57:29] <EmoSpice> create the div and then
[19:58:07] <EmoSpice> damnit - I don't remember fadeIn's syntax
[19:58:09] <EmoSpice> h.o
[19:59:06] <EmoSpice> Oh - you'd need to use a bind or some such to get the delay between showing and hiding.
[19:59:53] <EmoSpice> $('div.loader').fadeIn(3000).delay(10000).fadeOut(3000);
[20:01:03] <jaypitidi> thank you
[20:09:26] <Nicolas_Leonida2> how do you select all input objects within a div with class mydiv?
[20:10:02] <operhiem1> Nicolas_Leonida2: Wouldn't that be $('#mydiv input') ?
[20:10:08] <operhiem1> oh class
[20:10:19] <operhiem1> $('.mydiv input') I think
[20:10:48] <operhiem1> Yes.
[20:11:18] <Nicolas_Leonida2> operhiem1: thanks
[20:37:38] <Whirl3d> jaypitidi, you there?
[20:46:50] <Whirl3d> well, it's about time for some L4D2...i needa break and it's pretty quiet in here. talk to y'all later.
[21:38:57] <gf3> so quiet
[21:39:04] <gf3> nobody building a forum?

[21:39:25] <wookiehangover> just watching top gear and drinking beer
[21:39:43] <gf3> wookiehangover: do you need jQuery support for that?
[21:39:51] <gf3> wookiehangover: also how is the new season?
[21:39:56] <gf3> I haven't started watching yet
[21:40:03] <wookiehangover> $('beer').clone(true)
[21:40:07] <ajpiano> typical wookiehangover, doing a bunch of rhyming activities

[23:05:41] <NielsMob> hmm time to go
[23:05:58] <Assimilater> i have a button in a form, and when clicked on it triggers a toggle, both functions return false, but it still appears to submit the form; any ideas why?
[23:06:46] <coldhead> ?p @ Assimilater
[23:06:47] <bot-t> Assimilater, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:07:03] <Assimilater> i was hoping generalities would be enough...
[23:07:19] <Assimilater> if my approach isn't fundamentally flawed i guess i'll paste....
[23:07:29] <ajpiano> you probably are returning false from the wrong function
[23:10:03] <Assimilater> if you'll forgive the ugliness, i don't feel like adding the css :P http://jsfiddle.net/EAsbD/
[23:11:31] <ajpiano> if you don't mind an obtuse analogy
[23:11:53] <ajpiano> what you are expecting to happen here is akin to saying
[23:12:23] <ajpiano> when i call you on the phone, come over to my house
[23:12:35] <ajpiano> and then all i do is walk by the phone
[23:12:49] <ajpiano> and then you wonder why i never called.
[23:12:52] <ajpiano> that's kind of.. bad
[23:12:53] <ajpiano> in other words
[23:12:57] <ajpiano> you have to have a submit event.
[23:13:02] <ajpiano> to stop the form from submitting
[23:13:31] <ajpiano> just returning false from the click on the button is immateriali
[23:13:35] <jnylen> hi all, I'm writing a plugin which needs to store persistent state so that it can be called back later... what are good ways of doing this that support multiple instances on the page?
[23:13:41] <Assimilater> ok
[23:14:02] <Assimilater> then i guess the easiest solution is to switch out the button with input[type="button"]
[23:14:03] <ajpiano> jnylen: jQuery.data is your friend
[23:14:07] <ajpiano> Assimilater: no
[23:14:13] <pootpoot> when i use .find() do i have to specify an index? like $('#thing').find('p')[0] ?
[23:14:21] <jnylen> ajpiano: I won't have a root element, what's my key?
[23:14:26] <ajpiano> the solution is to have a $("form").submit(function(e) { }); that checks the state
[23:14:35] <Assimilater> truth be told though
[23:14:37] <Assimilater> that open setup
[23:14:38] <ajpiano> and then returns false or true accordingly
[23:14:39] <jnylen> pootpoot: depends on what you're after
[23:14:40] <Assimilater> is never meant to submit
[23:14:47] <jnylen> if you want the raw dom element, yes
[23:14:48] <Assimilater> the make changes is the submit
[23:14:52] <jnylen> if you want a jquery collection, no
[23:14:57] <ajpiano> Assimilater: so you need to put type=button on it
[23:15:02] <Assimilater> aye
[23:15:11] <ajpiano> jnylen: eh?
[23:15:12] <Assimilater> or role="button" i guess
[23:15:18] <ajpiano> you can store data on any elements,
[23:15:22] <ajpiano> Assimilater: no
[23:15:24] <ajpiano> not role
[23:15:24] <pootpoot> jnylen: if i pass $('#thing').find('p') to a function(element) can i call element.attr('id')
[23:15:25] <ajpiano> type
[23:15:36] <jnylen> pootpoot: yes
[23:15:40] <ajpiano> role is useful for ARIA stuff, but you need a type attribute on there so it doesn't default to type="submit"
[23:15:43] <ajpiano> and submit the form
[23:15:47] <jnylen> ajpiano: my plugin will be called like this
[23:16:02] <jnylen> $.shiftcheckbox('.checkbox-type-1', {options});
[23:16:09] <ajpiano> well
[23:16:11] <ajpiano> no one wants to do that
[23:16:15] <ajpiano> it's unjqueryish
[23:16:25] <jnylen> ajpiano: @me?
[23:16:29] <ajpiano> yep
[23:16:39] <jnylen> the reason for having it that way is because i need it to be able to use .live()
[23:16:41] <ajpiano> if you have some kind of constructor like that
[23:17:02] <ajpiano> you can apply it in an $.fn type way
[23:17:12] <jnylen> can I say $('.checkbox-type-1').shiftcheckbox({}) and have it work like .live()?
[23:17:25] <ajpiano> $.fn.foo = function() {  return this.each(function() {  new $.foo(this);  });  }
[23:17:36] <ajpiano> no
[23:17:40] <pootpoot> im not understanding the difference between find and next... does find() return multiple results if there are more than one? if not, then isnt it the same as next() ?
[23:17:49] <jnylen> ajpiano, which is fine if you have a static collection of elements
[23:17:51] <ajpiano> but there are other ways to have your thing support event delegation besides giving it a lame API
[23:18:29] <jnylen> yeah, I don't like it much either
[23:18:34] <jnylen> which is why I came to ask questions here :)
[23:18:40] <ajpiano> and then you could just call it on $(document)
[23:18:40] <Assimilater> my html5 newbness is showing, lol
[23:18:44] <jnylen> pootpoot: go read the docs
[23:18:50] <jnylen> find() and next() are totally utterly different
[23:18:58] <wwalser> pootpoot: next only searches direct siblings of elements within the collection. Find searches child nodes
[23:19:04] <ajpiano> they are like the hippie cow
[23:19:07] <ajpiano> uddlery differnt
[23:19:26] <wwalser> uddler...
[23:19:27] <jnylen> ajpiano: I guess my only reason for wanting to use .live() is since I'll be loading and reloading content dynamically
[23:19:39] <jnylen> but then if that happens my plugin's state is invalid anyway... so i might as well just not use .live()
[23:19:48] <ajpiano> jnylen: i'm not saying it's bad to want it to work on dynamic elements using event delegation
[23:20:00] <jnylen> ok, so how would you approach that?
[23:20:00] <ajpiano> i'm just saying you can make that work without forcing people to break the jquery paradigm
[23:21:40] <ajpiano> lazy-initialisation is one approach: http://enterprisejquery.com/2010/07/configuring-ui-widgets-and-interactions-with-live/
[23:22:41] <ajpiano> to be honest, i'm not sure how doing $.foo(args) somehow automatically means your thing "supports live"
[23:23:38] <ajpiano> just using live when doing plugin development isn't really partciularly wise compared with .delegate
[23:23:50] <ajpiano> because you're just binding a bunch of stuff on the document, it's not really instance specific at all
[23:24:06] <jnylen> yeah, i see
[23:24:22] <jnylen> i asked a question and in the process rethought the problem, i think all of that is overkill for what i'm doing
[23:24:34] <ajpiano> ah good :)
[23:24:46] <jnylen> another question: best way to tell if an object is jQuery?
[23:24:57] <jnylen> "instanceof $"?  "obj && obj.jquery"?
[23:25:12] <ajpiano> either is acceptable, i think the latter is faster
[23:28:13] <mazzachre> How can I make sure jquerymobile is initialized? I have a function that I run in document ready, it updates a list, but I get an error that listview refresh is not yet initialized.
[23:36:43] <mazzachre> Also what is the preffered way of updating a list for listview in jquerymobile? Currently I make an array where I push in the items and then do $(myList).html(myArray.join("")).listview('refresh');
[23:48:58] <pootpoot> i have this line .... var nextPost = jQuery('#' + currentPostId).next('.post').has('.l3d-player-container');
[23:49:12] <pootpoot> and sometimes nextPost.attr("id") returns undefined
[23:49:53] <pootpoot> is there something wrong with it?
[23:53:45] <wwalser> pootpoot: is the call to .attr("id") returning false, or is nextPost undefined and throwing an exception?
[23:56:08] <Double_rainbow> hello world
[23:56:47] <Double_rainbow> is there an example where when i scroll down, it scrolls horizontally instead of vertically?
[23:56:54] <pootpoot> wwalser nextPost traces [Object object]
