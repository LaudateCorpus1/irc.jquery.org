[02:09:49] <rominronin> I was thinking of using jquery to sort a list of elements by an attribute (eg. class) at the front-end. can anyone tell me if it’s even possible to sort in this way?
[02:09:53] <Mark_2> does anyone know how to make texts go up as i type away on this jquery chat room? so that the recent texts appear on the very bottom?

[02:10:21] <`ULT> Hello this is what I have now (and is working): http://prntscr.com/84hbag
[02:10:28] <`ULT> and this is what i want to achieve: http://prntscr.com/84hcfu
[02:10:33] <`ULT> My fiddle is: https://jsfiddle.net/8worawe9/5/
[02:10:38] <`ULT>  I have tried .closest, filter or another each, but I can not get it working
[02:10:49] <`ULT> anyone suggestions?
[02:16:43] <Mark_2> what’s the difference between append and prepend?
[02:17:10] <Uhkis> Mark_2: append = to the end, prepend = before
[02:17:33] <Mark_2> i have this chatroom, and i want to make the texts appear from the bottom to top
[02:17:38] <Mark_2> not from the top to bottom
[02:17:40] <Mark_2> how do i fix this?
[02:17:43] <Mark_2> anybody?
[02:26:17] <blinky_> Hi guys, I have 2 html select list with the numbers 1-25,  I would like to have the second list only allow the user to select a number matching or lower then the number selected in the first list.  What do I need to look into to complete this?
[02:29:06] <Uhkis> blinky_: listen change on the first one, then check the val() and hide <= from the next one
[02:29:43] <blinky_> ok cheers I will have a play now and see what I can do.
[03:00:52] <inex> fuck jquery
[03:16:19] <blinky_> Uhkis, Alright mate, could you have a look at this please, I have it disabling the second option list depending on the first selection but it is not working for the numbers 9 and 10, any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/5yy67ajw/
[03:18:07] <hekep> hi
[03:18:11] <blinky_> hi
[03:18:38] <Uhkis> blinky_: http://jsfiddle.net/5yy67ajw/1/
[03:18:57] <hekep> I have jqeruy 1.7  and ui 1.8  , autocomplete works fine ... after updating ui to 1.11 autocomplete stopped working ... how to debugit ?
[03:20:04] <blinky_> Uhkis, Thank you very much
[03:20:59] <Uhkis> blinky_: you want to use parseInt always when comparing numbers what you didn't set
[03:21:12] <Uhkis> (they're often strings)
[03:23:52] <blinky_> Uhkis, Did not even think about the variable type, cheers again
[03:33:59] <xvure> I have a xhr that responds a html page however I want to extract the content of a specified div from that page; is there a simple way to select the node within the xhr response?
[03:35:12] <Uhkis> xvure: $(data).find('#thatdiv')
[03:39:17] <xvure> Cheers Uhkis I swear Fridays drop my IQ 50 points
[03:39:54] <Uhkis> xvure: join the club :)
[03:42:28] <tlkrrr> morning, I have an issue with the jquery validation plugin, I need the param selectors to search within the current form rather than the entire DOM due to DOM reuse, anyone have any suggestions?
[03:44:10] <Uhkis> tlkrrr: make a jsfiddle
[03:44:26] <tlkrrr> Ok 2 minutes
[03:49:19] <`ULT-> hi!
[03:51:10] <tlkrrr> Here is a jsfiddle demonstrating the problem https://jsfiddle.net/896a2wav/   Uhkis
[03:52:54] <norc> Is it just me or is that jsfiddle broken?
[03:53:11] <norc> Oh well, seems like my Chrome has some issues rendering it.
[03:53:24] <tlkrrr> OK for me on ff and chrome
[03:53:31] * norc shrugs
[03:57:12] <Uhkis> tlkrrr: https://jsfiddle.net/896a2wav/1/
[03:58:03] <tlkrrr> Uhkis, the problem is that I have loads of reuse of code blocks, it's essentially the same form used in multiple places which makes it difficult to use ids
[03:58:23] <tlkrrr> I thought that jquery validate may search within the form it's validating but on reviewing the plugin it doesn't seem to
[03:59:20] <tlkrrr> The plugin source looks like if it's a checkable element then it searches within the form otherwise it doesn't
[03:59:41] <norc> tlkrrr: Use a depends field with a callback
[03:59:56] <norc> tlkrrr: That will call the callback, passing the element itself as an argument
[04:00:20] <norc> depends: function(element) { return your.validation; }
[04:00:34] <norc> something along these lines
[04:01:06] <tlkrrr> I will look into that norc, I was thinking about just overriding the element find method but it seems a bit crappy. Depends may well be a better solution.
[04:01:14] <Uhkis> norc: i've gotten a bunch of timeouts lately
[04:03:44] <`ULT-> hi taplar!
[04:03:54] <norc> tanath: Figured out the behavior from $.when yesterday. It was fairly simple and made perfect sense, I just had bad test examples.
[04:04:00] <taplar> yo
[04:04:01] <norc> taplar even.
[04:04:08] <taplar> cool
[04:04:46] <taplar> happy friday btw
[04:04:57] <Uhkis> isn't it just $.when(xhrhere).then(more).then(evenmore)
[04:06:13] <norc> taplar: If you have multiple deferreds resolving with multiple arguments each, the only sensible thing is to wrap these arguments into arrays. That was the logic behind it.
[04:06:28] <taplar> makes sense
[04:06:49] <norc> My test example with multiple deferreds was not useful, since they each resolved with just argument, in which case it did not wrap a single element into an array.
[04:07:34] <norc> Uhkis: well not xhrhere, but deferred/promise. ;-)
[04:08:34] <Uhkis> norc: well those aren't usually xhrs, right? ;)
[04:09:01] <taplar> 'usually' depends on context, :)
[04:09:03] <norc> Uhkis: $.ajax() returns a Promise.
[04:11:13] <Uhkis> norc: >=1.5
[04:11:13] <`ULT-> hi guys i have a problem, and i`m stucked.
[04:11:27] <norc> `ULT-: Just ask awaz
[04:11:42] <`ULT-> it is my lack of programming
[04:11:46] <`ULT-> 1 moment
[04:12:37] <norc> Uhkis: and you could even pass non-promise objects to $.when() :D
[04:13:19] <Uhkis> norc: i sure as hell wasn't gonna type in the whole api to irc
[04:14:49] <`ULT-> this is what I have now (and is working): http://prntscr.com/84hbag
[04:15:10] <`ULT-> and this is what i want to achieve: http://prntscr.com/84hcfu
[04:15:27] <`ULT-> Fiddle is: https://jsfiddle.net/8worawe9/5/
[04:15:41] <`ULT-> Do you guys have some suggestions how to achieve this?
[04:15:53] <`ULT-> I have tried another each, filter and closest
[04:16:28] <taplar> just so i'm clear, where should the result go?
[04:16:35] <taplar> in the second column?
[04:17:22] <`ULT-> against who are ou talking taplar?
[04:17:48] <taplar> u
[04:17:51] <`ULT-> aah oke,
[04:17:55] <`ULT-> you mean the product price?
[04:18:07] <`ULT-> that is only for the view.
[04:18:44] <taplar> what i mean is, from your picture it looks like your wanting to take '568,70' for example and add any selected children values
[04:18:50] <taplar> but then where do you want that result to go
[04:19:31] <`ULT-> the price from a product is the product price, and the price from 1 or more options behind that product (productoptions)
[04:19:42] <`ULT-> I want that the price from the product is updating to the new value
[04:20:04] <`ULT-> when a user clicks on a option with a value
[04:20:30] <taplar> ok, so you have a base price and then your calculating a price with options
[04:20:38] <`ULT-> yes thats true
[04:20:42] <taplar> gotcha
[04:20:55] <chriys> hi all, once an imation is over, how can I reset the original position of the element I have animated ?
[04:20:59] <`ULT-> and know i have a total price from all the selected options
[04:21:08] <`ULT-> becouse of the each loop on all the selects
[04:21:13] <`ULT-> *because
[04:24:54] <tlkrrr> Uhkis, norc if you're interested in my solution here it is: https://jsfiddle.net/896a2wav/2/
[04:25:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/8worawe9/6/
[04:27:01] <chriys> nvm found another way :p
[04:27:49] <`ULT-> hi taplar in major lines, I tried the same like you in the new fiddle :)
[04:28:00] <`ULT-> but uh, it is not working? :p
[04:28:21] <`ULT-> oow sorry
[04:28:24] <`ULT-> one moment
[04:28:27] <taplar> my mod just had it finding the related product price. i didn't use it anywhere
[04:28:29] <`ULT-> i didnt checked console.log
[04:30:02] <`ULT-> so now we have the related product price indeed :)
[04:30:05] <`ULT-> what is a good step
[04:30:43] <`ULT-> and now we have to add the selected options
[04:31:10] <Uhkis> tlkrrr: seems like the most elegant solution
[04:31:19] <taplar> so is the display of the product price going to change as user select and unselect options?
[04:32:16] <`ULT-> yes, that should be the most beatifull way
[04:32:52] <taplar> ok, in that case I would suggest changing '<span>€ 568,70</span>' to '€ <span class="totalPrice">568,70</span>' to make changing that easier
[04:33:03] <`ULT-> there are so many little things where you need to consider :p
[04:33:24] <`ULT-> oke, that is oke
[04:33:28] <`ULT-> i can change that in the html
[04:33:52] <`ULT-> 1 moment, i update the fiddle for you
[04:35:03] <`ULT-> btw taplar, if you are interested where it is for
[04:35:43] <`ULT-> this is the live site (exampel): http://www.kaskeus.nl/tuinkeus/index.php?route=product/product&path=32&product_id=313
[04:36:11] <taplar> nice
[04:36:23] <`ULT-> thanks, it is a personal project
[04:37:17] <`ULT-> and i dont have alot experience with programming, so it is slow but steady proceed
[04:37:23] <taplar> huh
[04:37:31] <taplar> € 1.068,43
[04:37:39] <taplar> is it valid that the . and , are flipped?
[04:37:43] <`ULT-> mainly due your guys help
[04:38:20] <`ULT-> what do you mean?
[04:38:34] <taplar> usually it would be 1,069.43, no?
[04:38:45] <Uhkis> where are you from taplar
[04:38:50] <`ULT-> aah, not in holland haha
[04:38:52] <taplar> gotcha, :)
[04:38:56] <taplar> see, this is why i asked
[04:39:15] <`ULT-> i should update the span
[04:39:23] <Uhkis> comma is decimal marker here in finland too
[04:45:41] <`ULT-> taplar: i updated the fiddle
[04:45:42] <`ULT-> https://jsfiddle.net/8worawe9/7/
[04:46:11] <`ULT-> the span is nog span class ="totalProductprice"
[04:46:46] <taplar> yeah, but take the € out of it
[04:46:54] <taplar> otherwise your going to have to re-set that each time
[04:46:59] <taplar> vs just setting the value
[04:52:08] <`ULT-> yes you have right
[04:52:14] <`ULT-> we need the val there
[04:52:35] <`ULT-> i fix that also for you
[04:52:46] <taplar> your fixing it for -you- :P
[04:53:13] <`ULT-> hahaaa, yes!
[04:53:54] <ABCDEF> Hi. Need some help understanding Promises: say you have assign $.Deferred to myVariable and then do 'myVariable.resolve('x'). What happens the next time you call a function which returns myVariable.promise() ?
[04:55:00] <`ULT-> should i made another span in the span taplar <span class="totalProductprice">€<span>300.00</span></span>
[04:55:02] <taplar> someone may correct me, but you'd get a new promise
[04:55:04] <`ULT-> such like this?
[04:55:18] <taplar> i'd put the class on the value span
[04:55:26] <taplar> as that's what your going to be targeting
[04:55:27] <`ULT-> oke yes
[04:55:36] <`ULT-> sounds fair enough
[04:56:27] <taplar> ABCDEF: also I don't know that myVariable.resolve() is an option.  you resolve off of the promise, not the base object
[04:56:46] <taplar> oh, nvm
[04:56:49] <taplar> it's a deferred
[04:57:25] <ABCDEF> taplar: yeah, it's a deferred so calling .resolve() on it should work
[04:58:02] <taplar> but yeah, i'd think you'd get a new promise
[05:00:25] <taplar> or no
[05:00:35] <taplar> it looks like a deferred returns the same promise
[05:00:42] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.Deferred
[05:01:04] <LogoS[es]> hello
[05:01:59] <taplar> aloha
[05:03:04] <LogoS[es]> :) can I ask you for some help?
[05:03:29] <taplar> chat room is open to question
[05:03:30] <taplar> s
[05:03:30] <`ULT-> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/8worawe9/8/
[05:03:39] <`ULT-> in the span the raw value
[05:03:44] <`ULT-> without , and €
[05:04:14] <taplar> yep, so now after you get done calculating the new total you can just set that span
[05:04:58] <ABCDEF> taplar: yep, I just founds an example to debug and it it seems like the same promise is returned.
[05:05:06] <LogoS[es]> I'm trying to execute a function from a tampermonkey script in Google Chrome console... but it say "undefined"
[05:06:04] <`ULT-> yes. and how we get the total value from the selected options only for that product?
[05:06:22] <LogoS[es]> I readed on stackoverflow that unsafewindow is needed if you want to see the vars from the script from te console...
[05:06:36] <ABCDEF> taplar: Now I'm confused about the difference between .then() and .done()
[05:06:42] <`ULT-> we need to scope this:    var sum = 0;
[05:06:42] <`ULT->     selects.each(function () {
[05:06:42] <`ULT->         sum += +$(this).find("option:selected").data("price");
[05:06:42] <`ULT->     });
[05:06:57] <`ULT-> now it is running on all the select fields
[05:07:15] <ABCDEF> taplar: I have a function that returns a .promise() of a deferred which has already been resolved
[05:07:30] <taplar> `ULT-: well, you have the one that changed. and you can find it's siblinging by looking for the other div that have a class 'option'
[05:07:50] <`ULT-> right. thanks
[05:07:51] <LogoS[es]> in this script Main.k.MushUpdate()... main is defined with unsafewindow
[05:07:58] <taplar> `ULT-: but consider this.  do you need to know about the others?
[05:08:03] <ABCDEF> taplar: if I call 'myFunc().done(function(value) { ... } ' the code inside 'done' will not run... but if I do 'myFunc().then(function(value) { ... } ' the code inside 'then' will run
[05:08:20] <ABCDEF> despite the fact that the deferred being used has been resolved successfully
[05:08:21] <`ULT-> what do you mean by others?
[05:08:40] <taplar> `ULT-: well think about it.  are you starting with no options selected?
[05:08:58] <`ULT-> yes
[05:09:30] <`ULT-> this is the starting point: http://prntscr.com/84ixoa
[05:09:40] <`ULT-> data-price = 0
[05:09:41] <taplar> `ULT-: ok, so when an option is changed.  really what your concerned about is adding that new value to the total.  and possibly subtracting the old value that was added if one was previously selected
[05:10:13] <`ULT-> you are right, the value need to be updated
[05:10:23] <`ULT-> so the old value need to subtracted
[05:10:40] <taplar> `ULT-: yep, so if you kept track of the old value added, if one, you could subract that, add your new value, and your done
[05:10:41] <`ULT-> or maybe better:
[05:11:01] <`ULT-> product price + selected options data-prices
[05:11:16] <taplar> but that's what i'm saying, you don't have to worry about the other options
[05:11:25] <taplar> they would have already been added to the total
[05:11:45] <taplar> your only concerned about how this option that just changed adjusts the total
[05:12:11] <`ULT-> yes
[05:12:57] <taplar> so you can get your current total from your span field
[05:13:03] <`ULT-> what I want is exactely what now is happeing
[05:13:38] <`ULT-> but not for all the options, but the options belonging to the product
[05:15:45] <LogoS[es]> I know my question maybe is in the right place... the script is jquery but... I don't know where I can find someone that help me with this :)
[05:29:04] <ManicPanic> anyone know how to prevent the scrollbar from jumping to the bottom when there is a new message in the chat box ? http://jsfiddle.net/nrp39was/
[05:31:10] <taplar> `ULT: something like this is what i'm talking about http://jsfiddle.net/20ruros3/
[05:32:38] <ManicPanic> do i have to use the $('#chatbox').scroll(...) function, and listen for changes all the time ?
[05:33:06] <Kartagis> when I use chosen plusing on my drupal website, the structure is select > div > a > span. do I need to create the same structure when using it standalone?
[05:35:19] <ManicPanic> When the user scrolls up i dont want the scrollbar to jump to the bottom, but still messages must be added. But when the scrollbar is at the bottom already i want it to stay there until the user moves it.
[05:43:24] <paulvd> hello, is there a video playlist plugin out there which can move to the next video , when the current video is finished ?
[05:43:55] <`ULT-> that looks good taplar, thanks
[05:44:05] <`ULT-> will studie that
[05:44:13] <taplar> cool, :)
[05:44:32] <`ULT-> I am also working on something and maybe that works also. Moment
[05:49:35] <paulvd> ?
[05:50:10] <`ULT-> taplar, do you have made that fiddle by yourself?
[05:50:30] <taplar> yup
[05:50:48] <`ULT-> thank you m8, this is exactely what it should be
[05:51:18] <taplar> you understand what it's doing?
[05:52:52] <`ULT-> not quite :p
[05:53:07] <taplar> well lets step through it
[05:53:13] <taplar> or i can add comments
[05:53:59] <`ULT-> 1 moment :p
[05:53:59] <paulvd> ?
[05:56:39] <`ULT-> i console.log all the variables taplar
[05:56:45] <`ULT-> to check what is doing exactely
[05:57:19] <LogoS[es]> someone can tell me how can I execute a function from a tampermonkey script in the Google Chrome console? Or tell me please where can I ask for this :)
[06:00:35] <`ULT-> what means: jQuery.fn.init[1] ?
[06:00:52] <KEHN> hi
[06:01:25] <taplar> `ULT-: http://jsfiddle.net/20ruros3/1/
[06:01:41] <`ULT-> wauw awesome man!
[06:01:45] <`ULT-> thanks
[06:04:45] <paulvd> i think both are same using multiple nickname
[06:05:18] <taplar> huh?
[06:18:21] <`ULT-> taplar, almost everything is clear! but what is this exactely: .prop('previousValue')
[06:18:49] <`ULT-> previousValue is something in jquery/ javascript?
[06:22:06] <taplar> it's a property on the element
[06:22:15] <taplar> think of it as a variable attached to the element
[06:22:52] <taplar> and since they're on the elements, they're relative to each
[06:23:09] <taplar> so one can change without affecting others
[06:24:02] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[06:25:11] <`ULT-> thank you taplar, so previousValue is a existing variable
[06:25:33] <taplar> only once that change handler sets it
[06:25:40] <taplar> at the end
[06:25:48] <taplar> until then it does not
[06:26:04] <`ULT-> yes, oke. I understand that.
[06:26:08] <`ULT-> I never ever heart of it
[06:26:13] <taplar> :)
[06:26:13] <`ULT-> of previousValue
[06:26:17] <taplar> nah
[06:26:20] <`ULT-> heard
[06:26:23] <taplar> can be whatever
[06:26:30] <`ULT-> yes. i get it
[06:26:32] <taplar> just a strung key
[06:26:47] <`ULT-> yes indeed, now it is clear
[06:27:00] <`ULT-> i understand what you mean :p
[06:27:47] <`ULT-> this is also working: ($select.prop(' '))
[06:28:02] <`ULT-> it doesn`t matter what here is in the prop
[06:28:10] <`ULT-> *there
[06:28:15] <taplar> nope
[06:28:32] <taplar> but being descriptive to your logic helps readability
[06:28:45] <`ULT-> yes, haha.
[06:29:05] <`ULT-> i was searching on google to previousValue :p
[06:29:16] <taplar> sorry bout that
[06:29:45] <`ULT-> no problem it is clear. thanks alot man :)
[06:29:47] <`ULT-> for helping me
[06:29:49] <Sal> can someone tell me why scrollTop doesn't jump to the right element?
[06:29:55] <KEHN> anyone use lorempixel.com ?
[06:30:10] <Sal> i first query an element and get its position().top, then i scrollTop to it
[06:30:19] <Sal> but it jumps far away from it
[06:30:44] <Sal> this is what i do: $('.scroller').scrollTop($('[data-id="' + window.$cnp + '"]').position().top);
[06:30:56] <Sal> am i doing something wrong?
[06:41:07] <taplar> Sal: you mean something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/m04ac1uy/
[06:42:17] <Sal> taplar: on phone, 2 secs
[06:43:28] <xvure> Maybe I'm just looking at this the wrong way but it there any valid reason why scrollTop would only fire once?
[06:43:55] <taplar> what do you mean?
[06:49:05] <xvure> scrollTop on a handler, on the initial click it will scroll; on any subsequent clicks it will not
[06:49:21] <xvure> However any other actions bound to the handler fire as normal
[06:55:00] <taplar> mmm, in my fiddle looks like position changes with scroll
[06:55:31] <taplar> instead of being a constant offset from top value
[06:59:36] <taplar> there we go http://jsfiddle.net/m04ac1uy/1/
[07:12:29] <Mark_2> can anyone check on my website why the ajax load isn’t working? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/Chat/
[07:12:46] <Mark_2> if i click on the load content button it shhoud load texts.
[07:18:23] <jphase> Mark_2: jQuery is not defined
[07:18:44] <Mark_2> hmm
[07:18:52] <Mark_2> i wonder what i have done wrong.
[07:18:57] <jphase> Mark_2: that's because you have it below the jquery-ui script
[07:19:26] <jphase> you should also include those before </body> instead of in the head and stick all your jQuery in a document ready wrapper
[07:23:06] <Sal> taplar, yesm something like that
[07:23:26] <Sal> but i can't use the child:nth
[07:23:35] <Sal> becaues i don't know the number
[07:24:01] <Sal> i have to query the dom for a data-id="22"
[07:24:39] <Mark_2> stil isn’t loading.
[07:24:47] <Sal> because i'm display a list and every item has a data-id on it
[07:27:34] <jphase> Mark_2: wrap your jQuery (line 14-77) in a doc ready wrapper:   jQuery(document).ready(function($) {  (lines-14-177 code here)  }); and put your jquery-ui stylesheet back in the head
[07:28:42] <jphase> 14-77*
[07:31:52] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/Chat/
[07:32:03] <Mark_2> I did exactly what you told me to do.
[07:32:08] <Mark_2> has some console errors.
[07:33:46] <jphase> Mark_2: whoa whoa, no, one sec, let me do this for you
[07:33:57] <Xatenev> Mark_2: i cant chat there
[07:33:57] <Xatenev> :(
[07:34:10] <Mark_2> hy not Xatenev ?
[07:34:19] <Xatenev> Mark_2: theres no submit button
[07:34:20] <Xatenev> xd
[07:34:24] <Mark_2> exaclty.
[07:34:34] <Xatenev> give me a submit button i wanna chat!:(
[07:34:38] <Mark_2> supposedly it is supposed to be working by only hitting enter.
[07:34:43] <Mark_2> but something went wrong.
[07:34:59] <Mark_2> occasionally it works when you refresh the page numerous times.
[07:36:04] <jphase> Mark_2: ick, this is all weird with your tabs and stuff, but try this:  http://hastebin.com/kewesahesu.xml
[07:37:25] <Xatenev> id="sendie"
[07:37:25] <Xatenev> LOL
[07:37:30] <Mark_2> um,
[07:37:50] <Mark_2> jphase: i appreciate your help and interest on this, but there are still console errors.
[07:38:05] <Mark_2> all i did was adding ajax code to my php jquery chat room
[07:38:10] <Mark_2> and now the chat room doesn’t work either.
[07:38:17] <Mark_2> ;)
[07:38:26] <jphase> yes, you're correct lol, and we're now at far less errors than were there were before
[07:38:34] <jphase> before you had jQuery is not defined errors
[07:38:45] <jphase> but if you'd like to go ahead and figure the rest of it out on your own that's fine by me
[07:38:46] <Mark_2> Xatenev: you must  know ton about jquery chatroom?
[07:38:56] <Mark_2> well, i appreciate any help really,
[07:39:03] <Xatenev> Mark_2: probably
[07:39:03] <Xatenev> xD
[07:39:04] <Mark_2> im more curious why the jquery isn’t working.
[07:39:15] <Mark_2> don’t play games on me Xatenev.
[07:39:20] <Mark_2> give me all you know!!
[07:39:27] <Mark_2> ;)
[07:39:28] <Xatenev> Mark_2: show the chat.js :)
[07:39:28] <Xatenev> :P
[07:39:35] <Mark_2> sec..
[07:39:42] <Xatenev> are u working with an IDE?
[07:39:49] <Xatenev> or just some random editor?
[07:39:51] <Mark_2> actually, this chat room is very basic.
[07:40:00] <Mark_2> nah, i downloaded this chatroom
[07:40:01] <Xatenev> <script type="text/javascript" src="chat.js"></script> it looks like chat.js might not be there
[07:40:08] <Mark_2> sec.
[07:40:52] <Mark_2> try it now : http://lifeto.cafe24.com/Chat/
[07:40:53] <Mark_2> it works.
[07:41:03] <Mark_2> that is if i get rid of the ajax part.
[07:41:18] <Mark_2> the problem is not this chat room.
[07:41:43] <Xatenev> and where is ur ajax part?^^
[07:41:43] <Mark_2> there is the upgraded version of this chat room: check this out : https://css-tricks.com/chat2/
[07:41:49] <Mark_2> i got rid of it.
[07:41:51] <Mark_2> but wait.
[07:42:30] <Mark_2> if you are so familiar with the jquery, you could probably help me figureing out how to install this chat2
[07:42:30] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/Chat/
[07:42:34] <Mark_2> wory
[07:42:36] <Mark_2> sorry wrong address
[07:42:47] <Mark_2> https://css-tricks.com/chat2/
[07:42:56] <Mark_2> i installed it on my web-server
[07:43:01] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/Chat2
[07:43:07] <Mark_2> but it doesn’t workcause there is no chat room.
[07:43:21] <Mark_2> can you perhaps teach me how to create that chatroom…? lol
[07:43:32] <Xatenev> Mark_2: yea
[07:43:35] <Xatenev> u connected it with a database?
[07:43:40] <Mark_2> yeah
[07:43:44] <Xatenev> go into the database
[07:43:53] <Xatenev> there should be a table called rooms or chatoroms
[07:43:55] <Xatenev> or something like that
[07:44:00] <Mark_2> i have php my admin.
[07:44:03] <Mark_2> sec.
[07:44:03] <Mark_2> there is, but
[07:44:16] <Xatenev> go into that table and add a new row
[07:44:21] <Mark_2> in the guideline on this website
[07:44:25] <Mark_2> https://css-tricks.com/chat2/
[07:44:37] <Mark_2> it doesn’t say much about exactly what i have to do.
[07:44:40] <Xatenev> it does
[07:44:43] <Xatenev> go into that table
[07:44:44] <Xatenev> and add a new row
[07:45:14] <Mark_2> there are 3 tables that are related to this chat plug-in
[07:45:20] <Xatenev> how are they called
[07:45:23] <Mark_2> chat_room
[07:45:24] <Mark_2> chat_users
[07:45:27] <Xatenev> chat_room
[07:45:27] <Mark_2> chat_users_rooms
[07:45:28] <Xatenev> go into that
[07:45:36] <Xatenev> add a new row there
[07:45:38] <Mark_2> i got into that
[07:45:42] <Mark_2> sec
[07:45:45] <Xatenev> name => the name of ur chatroom
[07:45:46] <Xatenev> numofuser 0
[07:45:54] <Xatenev> file => the name of the .txt where the chat log is stored
[07:46:18] <Mark_2> how do i share screenshot?
[07:46:21] <Mark_2> i have to show you this.
[07:46:26] <Xatenev> www.imgur.com
[07:46:27] <Mark_2> otherwise you won’t get it lol
[07:46:28] <Mark_2> sec
[07:46:36] <Xatenev> u can just drag your screenshot onto that page
[07:46:39] <Xatenev> and click upload.
[07:47:15] <Mark_2> the thing is
[07:47:25] <Mark_2> i do not know where the SS is stored on my mac
[07:47:26] <Mark_2> lol
[07:47:30] <Mark_2> it is not desktop
[07:47:37] <Mark_2> but give me a sec.
[07:47:44] <Xatenev> why u need to show me a screenshot
[07:47:46] <Xatenev> just do what I told u
[07:47:47] <Xatenev> lawl
[07:48:26] <Mark_2> fortunately it supports copyboard’s image
[07:48:30] <Mark_2> http://imgur.com/o4nDyWQ
[07:48:39] <Mark_2> how do i set up?
[07:48:42] <Xatenev> lawl
[07:48:48] <Mark_2> it has no ‘name’
[07:48:48] <Xatenev> your trying to add a field there
[07:48:53] <Xatenev> instead of a row into the table
[07:48:53] <NoiseEee> Mark_2: this has nothing to do with #jquery
[07:48:55] <Mark_2> oh. that’s not it?
[07:49:04] <Xatenev> just whisper me Mark_2 ...
[07:49:11] <Mark_2> i will pm you
[07:54:47] <tr3y> Hey all. I have 2 pages, page A and page B. On page A I am refreshing a DIV by using .load on a separate PHP page (page B) using setInterval. Page B is doing a MySQL query to get information so that page A can display any changes from that table. Is there a better way to do this? I was thinking maybe a "listener" of sorts on page A that can receive information from a separate page and update
[07:54:47] <tr3y> the div then? That way I can only update information when the table is updated rather than using a query every X seconds.
[07:58:12] <NoiseEee> tr3y: well sure you can bind an event to "listen" for, thats a lot of JS
[07:58:20] <NoiseEee> tr3y: but what should it listen for before making that query?
[08:04:42] <django_> hey
[08:05:17] <django_> if i use $('#a').show(); can i put multiple IDs as such: $('#a','#b','#c').show();
[08:05:53] <robertmaxrees> pass one string -  $('#a, #b, #c')
[08:06:20] <django_> robertmaxrees: ty!
[08:06:48] <tr3y> NoiseEee: Well, I am pretty new to javascript and jquery so I apologize if this is a little noobish, but I'm not sure. I have a page where a form is being filled out and that is in turn doing an INPUT to the database with the information they filled in. I was thinking at that point I could send the command to page A to run a sql query. So I guess the listener would have to just be sitting there
[08:06:48] <tr3y> waiting for my other page to say "update the info" so to say.
[08:11:23] <jak2000> hi all not know why not add a item to a select/option:  $('#xcombcatpallprod').append($woption); where $woption="<option val='41'>vfvf vfvf vfvf vfvf</option>" wich is bad? or how to add this item?
[08:11:24] <django_> robertmaxrees: im gettingan error
[08:11:44] <robertmaxrees> django_ what's the error?
[08:11:47] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that's how you do that.
[08:12:16] <django_> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[08:12:18] <django_> robertmaxrees: ^
[08:12:30] <robertmaxrees> show the code then
[08:12:41] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p67tj6jo/ - this works.
[08:12:54] <jak2000> in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/t188gq1j/9/  work but in my code not :(
[08:12:59] <jak2000> ok checking your fiddle
[08:13:03] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 any console errors?
[08:13:42] * django_ facepalm
[08:13:45] <django_> forgot )};
[08:14:08] <jak2000> robertmaxrees checking
[08:16:25] <NoiseEee> tr3y: yes, the listener would be sitting there.  something like $('input').on('change', someFunctionThatMakesAJAXCall)
[08:18:36] <django_> how do i get rid of paused in debbuger?
[08:19:01] <robertmaxrees> hit the run button.
[08:19:09] <robertmaxrees> under sources
[08:19:15] <robertmaxrees> (if you're in chrome)
[08:22:47] <jak2000> robertmaxrees yes a error....
[08:22:51] <jak2000> thanks
[08:22:54] <jak2000> i have other q.
[08:23:40] <robertmaxrees> shoot
[08:24:49] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/t188gq1j/11/  in this fiddle if the user click on new item, and add by sample orange i want insert after apple (sorted)  or.... how to append and resort the option values?
[08:25:18] <robertmaxrees> why do you have multiple handlers in there?
[08:25:40] <robertmaxrees> and there are a few ways to do this.  the cleanest way would be to modify and array and sort the array, then render that out.
[08:25:45] <jak2000> ahh error. i pasted other code
[08:25:48] <jak2000> wait a moment please
[08:26:09] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/t188gq1j/12/
[08:26:21] <robertmaxrees> ^ did you see my suggestion?
[08:26:43] <jak2000> yes i see
[08:26:52] <jak2000> ok reading
[08:27:21] <robertmaxrees> also: this.selectedOptions[0].value could be represented with this.val();
[08:27:27] <robertmaxrees> err, this.value
[08:27:40] <jak2000> ok
[08:28:49] <django_> hey guys
[08:32:05] <zigzagzi_> i was wondering if theres an alternative to contains('text')? i want to only pick up the exact word and its picking up 2 words (text and text box) instead of only the first
[08:32:33] <robertmaxrees> zigzagzi_ you can use .filter() and do whatever you want/.
[08:33:06] <zigzagzi_> so basically .filter('text') insead?
[08:33:10] <zigzagzi_> instead*
[08:33:10] <robertmaxrees> no.
[08:33:20] <zigzagzi_> sorry i'm learning :(
[08:33:25] <robertmaxrees> go check out the docs.
[08:33:30] <zigzagzi_> i'm on them
[08:33:36] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[08:33:48] <robertmaxrees> use the function option
[08:33:57] <zigzagzi_> ok
[08:34:06] <robertmaxrees> if you're still lost, whip up a fiddle :)
[08:35:06] <zigzagzi_> $(function(){ $("#FormField_11 option:contains('United States')").prependTo('select#FormField_11');
[08:35:11] <zigzagzi_> thats what i currently have.
[08:35:42] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what your markup looks like - that's why i asked for a fiddle.
[08:35:52] <zigzagzi_> okay on moment.
[08:35:53] <zigzagzi_> one*
[08:38:44] <zigzagzi_> http://jsfiddle.net/L6zh07xp/
[08:39:37] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue here exactly?
[08:40:39] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L6zh07xp/1/ <- with jquery added.
[08:41:47] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to make sure you only match on elements whose value/text is JUST "United States"?
[08:43:26] <zigzagzi_> yes
[08:43:36] <zigzagzi_> sorry had an allergy attack
[08:43:39] <robertmaxrees> it's cool.
[08:43:59] <zigzagzi_> i only want to match "United States"
[08:44:06] <zigzagzi_> not "United States Outlying whatever"
[08:44:10] <robertmaxrees> right
[08:44:14] <robertmaxrees> so yeah.
[08:44:22] <robertmaxrees> what isn't clear on .filter()?
[08:55:58] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/fmstp4bb/1/  <-- i need select a option in a second select/option control, any advice how do it? thanks
[08:56:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:56:23] <robertmaxrees> you want the two to match?
[08:57:23] <jak2000> yes
[08:57:28] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you need to update the selector for the button first.
[08:57:31] <Mark_2> what do you think of this chat room? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/Chat2/room/?name=chatroom
[08:57:32] <jak2000> if is elect apple in second i need select apple
[08:57:35] <robertmaxrees> and second you can just set the .val() of one with the other.
[08:58:18] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fmstp4bb/4/
[08:58:29] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 what do you mean?
[08:58:38] <Mark_2> how do you think of it?
[08:58:49] <robertmaxrees> it's an option to build a chat room?
[08:59:10] <Mark_2> um,
[08:59:16] <Mark_2> what can you see?
[08:59:32] <robertmaxrees> that link is takiing me to css-stricks.com
[08:59:41] <robertmaxrees> err, css-tricks.com
[08:59:42] <Mark_2> lol….
[08:59:51] <Mark_2> oh..
[08:59:52] <Mark_2> that’s why..
[08:59:55] <robertmaxrees> it's redirecting me.
[09:00:15] <jak2000> robertmaxrees done, thanks
[09:00:29] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/Chat2/
[09:00:30] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 also - don't prepend id selectors with tags.
[09:00:40] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 so you implemented the one from css-tricks?
[09:00:52] <Mark_2> yes.
[09:00:55] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[09:00:57] <robertmaxrees> well done :)
[09:01:13] <Mark_2> can you access that chat room
[09:01:15] <Mark_2> ?
[09:01:19] <Mark_2> i do not see you on the list.
[09:01:33] <robertmaxrees> not sure why i'd join...
[09:01:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:01:51] <zigzagzig> robertmaxrees: sorry internet disconnected.
[09:02:07] <robertmaxrees> zigzagzig jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L6zh07xp/3/ this was you, right?
[09:02:14] <zigzagzig> yep
[09:02:24] <zigzagzig> omg!
[09:02:27] <zigzagzig> thats exactly what i wanted ;)
[09:03:09] <zigzagzig> but I also wanted #FormField_21 ..is that an easy addition?
[09:03:17] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:03:38] <printForever> I'm looking to update a current plugin called Tabslet | tabs jQuery plugin
[09:04:00] <printForever> to extend the tab switching outside HTML structure that has been predefined
[09:04:49] <zigzagzig> thank you for your assistance robertmaxrees -- i am just starting to learn jQuery and JS over the past week.
[09:06:31] <printForever> https://cdn.rawgit.com/vdw/Tabslet/master/jquery.tabslet.js
[09:07:04] <printForever> everything starts here $this.find('> div')
[09:07:30] <printForever> I thought to replace .find() with .filter()
[09:07:53] <printForever> so it can run through entire page and find whats needed
[09:08:10] <printForever> whats needed = anchor href# paired with ID
[09:09:34] <robertmaxrees> printForever there are a few ways to do that.  the smartest would be to abstract out the whole filter thinger into a function and pass in the particular select.
[09:09:49] <printForever> now you're talking my language
[09:10:01] <printForever> ok, how do I do that? :)
[09:10:08] <robertmaxrees> err.
[09:10:15] <robertmaxrees> i meant that for zigzagzig haha
[09:10:16] <robertmaxrees> sorry
[09:10:20] <printForever> yeah...
[09:10:36] <printForever> np
[09:10:53] <robertmaxrees> printForever what does this plugin do for you?
[09:10:57] <printForever> tab switch
[09:11:01] <printForever> simple, tab, switch
[09:11:04] <robertmaxrees> why not build your own?
[09:11:26] <printForever> I used this plugin on few projects
[09:11:38] <printForever> and thought I could repay the guy by helping him
[09:11:43] <printForever> further develop his plugin
[09:11:55] <printForever> by extending html structure
[09:12:34] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you mean by that?
[09:13:16] <printForever> https://cdn.rawgit.com/vdw/Tabslet/master/jquery.tabslet.js
[09:13:21] <robertmaxrees> i already saw that.
[09:13:27] <robertmaxrees> use plain english to explain what you want :)
[09:13:30] <printForever> :D
[09:13:36] <printForever> see the "Sample html structure"
[09:14:20] <robertmaxrees> you want to be able to specify something different?
[09:14:26] <printForever> his plugin requires that HMTL is written in a specific way. So for the plugin to work, tabs and tab content need to be in the same div.
[09:14:31] <printForever> yeah
[09:15:10] <robertmaxrees> uhh...
[09:15:11] <robertmaxrees> var fn = eval(
[09:15:13] <robertmaxrees> uuuuhhhhhh
[09:15:20] <robertmaxrees> this plugin is pretty... interesting.
[09:16:09] <robertmaxrees> your issue here is going to be that you'll need to pass in a whole bunch of logic to make this work the way you're envisioning.
[09:16:31] <printForever> :/
[09:16:32] <robertmaxrees> which kind of defeats the point of the plugin.
[09:16:36] <printForever> well, that sucks
[09:16:41] <printForever> right
[09:16:45] <robertmaxrees> and that eval is kind of... funky.
[09:16:52] <printForever> I will write my own thing
[09:16:57] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you could pretty easily build your own tab system.  it's not very hard.
[09:17:13] <printForever> that was my Plan B
[09:24:28] <daynaskully> is it possible to target a specific element in an embedded svg for a hover action?
[09:39:34] <zigzagzig> I am trying to filter the text "United States" ONLY and not "United States Minor Outlying Islands" -- can anyone provide me so guidance? http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L6zh07xp/1/
[09:39:50] <robertmaxrees> we already did that part ;)
[09:40:00] <robertmaxrees> what was your next step?
[09:40:02] <zigzagzig> oh wait
[09:40:05] <zigzagzig> i sent the wrong fiddle
[09:40:24] <zigzagzig> https://jsfiddle.net/L6zh07xp/5/
[09:40:26] <zigzagzig> ^updated link
[09:40:38] <robertmaxrees> so couple issues.
[09:41:01] <robertmaxrees> first of all, var $formFields = $('#FormField_11', '#FormField_21'), isn't doing what you think, but even if you did it right, it's not what you want :)
[09:41:18] <zigzagzig> I was just trying to stick to the DRY principle.
[09:41:30] <robertmaxrees> because the prependTo() would have no way of knowing which element "belongs" to which "formField"
[09:41:32] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[09:42:05] <zigzagzig> yes
[09:42:20] <robertmaxrees> so we'd start with var $formFields = $('#FormField_11, #FormField_21'),
[09:42:26] <robertmaxrees> instead of two args, it should be one.
[09:42:55] <robertmaxrees> second, we need to abstract out that filter.
[09:42:58] <zigzagzig> okay. but not an ID?
[09:43:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:43:12] <robertmaxrees> IDs are fine - you have two different dropdowns you're concerned with.
[09:43:24] <zigzagzig> okay. so either choose 11 or 21 for the arg?
[09:43:29] <robertmaxrees> ... no.
[09:43:34] <robertmaxrees> just use var $formFields = $('#FormField_11, #FormField_21');
[09:43:38] <robertmaxrees> instead of var $formFields = $('#FormField_11', '#FormField_21');
[09:43:41] <zigzagzig> :facepalm: *embarassed*
[09:43:47] <robertmaxrees> see how it's one string instead of two?
[09:43:56] <zigzagzig> yes with the 's
[09:44:13] <zigzagzig> makes sense
[09:44:38] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[09:44:56] <robertmaxrees> so start by trying to abstract out that filtering business.
[09:45:17] <zigzagzig> it is filtering now, but it displays United States two times instead of one.
[09:45:52] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to abstract out that block into a function instead.
[09:46:30] <zigzagzig> oh okay
[09:46:53] <zigzagzig> so make an if statement? lol
[09:46:56] <zigzagzig> inside the function
[09:47:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:47:00] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:47:10] <jak2000> css questions here? :)
[09:47:14] <zigzagzig> lol
[09:47:17] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 start with #css
[09:47:28] <zigzagzig> i'm not 100% sure what abstracting is
[09:47:38] <zigzagzig> OOP?
[09:47:40] <Utils> Which is preferred: .prop('checked') or .is(':checked') ?
[09:47:48] <robertmaxrees> Utils the former - .prop()
[09:47:52] <jak2000> ye si know but, sleep the channel
[09:47:55] <robertmaxrees> zigzagzig make it so you can cann that as a function with args instead.
[09:48:12] <robertmaxrees> zigzagzig https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L6zh07xp/7/
[09:48:12] <Utils> ok thanks robertmaxrees.
[09:48:14] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[09:48:45] <zigzagzig> i will study this code
[09:49:21] <zigzagzig> that is some genius work robertmaxrees
[09:49:28] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[09:49:32] <robertmaxrees> just know the toolset ;)
[09:49:41] <zigzagzig> I just started learning! :D
[09:50:25] <zigzagzig> I signed up for a programming JavaScript bootcamp. Starts in a week. I've been doing WordPress custom themes the past couple years and think this could take me to the next levle.
[09:50:27] <zigzagzig> level*

[10:13:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:13:49] <robertmaxrees> that's definitely not my username. never has been.
[10:16:07] <kriskropd> im trying to use slideDown to slide down list items when the page loads http://jsfiddle.net/zqjdc9yh/ - am I even doing that right?
[10:17:10] <robertmaxrees> they're already "expanded.
[10:17:24] <Uhkis> hide them with css first
[10:17:33] <kriskropd> ah, okay
[10:57:39] <daynaskully> {Q} how can you access the # in the url? such as /whatever/#value -- i need to use it to trigger what displays

[11:13:19] <Lencl> hello
[11:14:30] <Lencl> I'm using jquery mobile, and I have this $("#settings").popup("yes");
[11:14:37] <Lencl> but it's not opening... how can I debug why???
[11:17:47] <hrusti> can I add event listener to *before click* event?
[11:17:54] <robertmaxrees> hrusti nope.
[11:18:09] <robertmaxrees> Lencl http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[11:21:05] <mentoc> I have an element that has style visibility:hidden. I want to slideDown() the element but can't seem to get it right. I tried $(obj).css("visibility","visible").slideDown() but that doesn't show the slideDown animation. Any ideas?
[11:22:14] <robertmaxrees> you want to display: none; it.
[11:22:47] <mentoc> trying now...
[11:23:23] <mentoc> Brilliant! Thank you so much! :)
[11:29:54] <daynaskully> {Q} is it possible to target an embedded SVG id for an on click event?
[11:30:13] <robertmaxrees> daynaskully http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3294553/jquery-selector-svg-incompatible
[11:31:15] <daynaskully> oh my
[11:31:28] <robertmaxrees> jquery and svg don't really get along, basically.
[11:31:31] <NoiseEee> well
[11:31:50] <NoiseEee> i'm pretty sure i've bound click and other events to SVG areas
[11:31:54] <PlanC> I'm trying to load a <div> asynchronously
[11:32:05] <PlanC> or to be more specific it's a <script>
[11:32:26] <PlanC> the script is on a remote server which sometimes is really slow causing the page to load for over 10 seconds!
[11:32:42] <PlanC> I unfortunately don't have the ability to move it to the bottom of the document either
[11:32:58] <PlanC> how can I have the <script> load after the page's loaded completely
[11:33:08] <PlanC> or even better, how can I have the <script> load asynchronously?
[11:33:15] <robertmaxrees> add the async and defer attributes
[11:33:18] <robertmaxrees> see if that helps.
[11:33:33] <PlanC> I'm not allowed to change the <script>
[11:33:38] <PlanC> it's an ad-tag
[11:33:41] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[11:34:04] <PlanC> yeah...
[11:34:05] <robertmaxrees> then you're SOL unless you write it in using js
[11:34:17] <robertmaxrees> what does the code you have now look like?
[11:35:06] <PlanC> I tried a simple display:none, and displayed it with jQuery, but that didn't work since browsers seem to load the content regardless of the whether it's displayed or not
[11:35:15] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[11:35:33] <PlanC> right now it's a very simple <script src="http://remoteserver.com"></script>
[11:35:40] <PlanC> I just need to have this load after the entire page has loaded
[11:35:52] <PlanC> earlier I used to just add it right before </body> and move it to the right place using CSS
[11:36:03] <PlanC> but since the page is responsive now (bootstrap) I can't do that
[11:36:29] <robertmaxrees> <script async src="http://remoteserver.com"></script>
[11:36:50] <PlanC> I can't add that
[11:37:05] <PlanC> even if I could, older browsers wouldn't support it
[11:37:06] <robertmaxrees> so then how are you putting that on the page?
[11:37:31] <PlanC> what do you mean?
[11:37:45] <Kartagis> I've got a Drupal site with a module which uses the jQuery chosen plugin. before enabling the module, it's just select > option; however after enabling, it's select > div > a > span with additional classes. which structure should I use if I want to use the plugin standalone?
[11:37:56] <PlanC> right now I'm just putting <script src="http://remoteserver"></script> and it takes > 10 seconds for the page to load sometimes
[11:38:26] <PlanC> I need to somehow have the script load in the end
[11:38:34] <robertmaxrees> ... so then add async.  that'll take care of newer browsers.  otherwise, look into using something like https://css-tricks.com/thinking-async/
[11:38:59] <PlanC> I'll take a look at that
[11:39:05] <PlanC> I'm not allowed to add "async" to the <script>
[11:39:11] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why.
[11:39:14] <PlanC> they don't allow me to alter the <script>
[11:39:19] <robertmaxrees> then you have no choices.
[11:39:20] <PlanC> it's to reduce fraud
[11:39:24] <robertmaxrees> you cannot fix this.
[11:39:25] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[11:39:42] <PlanC> there has to be a way to fix it without touching the script
[11:39:57] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[11:40:47] <robertmaxrees> i'd contact the company and let them know their ad tags are way slow.  that should be cause for concern.  if it continues being an issue, look at moving to somebody else.
[11:40:53] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:41:30] <PlanC> I was thinking about appending the script through another script which would be loaded right before </div>
[11:41:36] <PlanC> *</body>
[11:41:51] <PlanC> the problem is that this way the appended script wouldn't be executed
[11:51:27] <NoiseEee> why would there be a fix without touching the script?
[11:51:36] <NoiseEee> botched execution = re-execute
[11:59:39] <PlanC> because there has to be a way to do it
[11:59:56] <PlanC> currently trying to load the contents of the script into a div that's located in the bottom of the page
[12:00:13] <PlanC> once it's loaded the contents of the div will be moved to another div which is higher
[12:00:50] <NoiseEee> great
[12:01:13] <NoiseEee> but if your hangup is waiting for the server to give you the contents, and it's in the <head>, you're SOL
[12:01:14] <PlanC> the theory sounds good, giving it a try now to see if it actually works
[12:01:49] <NoiseEee> "i know this is the wrong way but surely it can be molded into something thats works correctly" is not really a sensible statement
[12:01:58] <NoiseEee> but best of luck
[12:10:27] <PlanC> haha, hell yeah
[12:10:34] <PlanC> I think I got close to a solution
[12:11:36] <PlanC> so basically I'm creating a <div id='loading'><script src='http://remoteserver.com'></script></div> right before </body>
[12:11:55] <PlanC> then I'm placing a <div id='location'></div> where I actually want the content to show up
[12:12:07] <PlanC> with this simple line:
[12:12:20] <PlanC> $($('#loading').contents()).appendTo('#location');
[12:12:29] <PlanC> I'm able to move the contents to #location
[12:12:38] <robertmaxrees> what a terrible ad platform.
[12:14:22] <PlanC> yeah, they're a bit retro when it comes to the tags
[12:14:33] <PlanC> but, the main thing is that there actually WAS a solution
[12:15:49] <PlanC> thanks to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3242820/move-content-from-one-hidden-div-to-another-displayed-div
[12:15:59] <PlanC> and NoiseEee for the motivation
[12:16:20] <logancderp> guys, I'm a bit confused... I'm passing a cookie value into my jquery here (nothing sensitive) but the value is the decimal 10.00 ... I want to keep the trailing decimal points because it represents a monetary figure... How can I make jquery keep them?
[12:17:31] <robertmaxrees> represent it as a string.
[12:17:46] <robertmaxrees> or use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed
[12:18:40] <logancderp> no way its that simple lawl
[12:19:37] <logancderp> so it is... thanks :)
[12:19:42] <logancderp> didn't know about that function before
[12:19:53] <logancderp> but now I do and I will love it and look after it and name it Fred
[12:19:58] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:21:55] <logancderp> now all's I gotta do is try remember how to alternate background colors for rows in a table

[14:05:51] <timg__> is it new, that this doesnt work? jQuery('a, <img>')
[14:22:26] <shoky> timg__: no, that's not supposed to work
[14:22:38] <timg__> shoky: why?
[14:22:47] <timg__> in older versions this works
[14:22:48] <shoky> what is it supposed to do?
[14:23:03] <shoky> you're supposed to either pass a selector, or an html string if you want to build an element
[14:23:32] <timg__> shoky: but it's a breaking change?
[14:23:41] <shoky> maybe older versions allowed it for some reason, i dunno
[14:23:53] <timg__> im am sure they do
[14:23:54] <shoky> what do you want it to do..?
[14:24:22] <timg__> i want to force jquery to create an <img> tag,
[14:24:31] <timg__> just some security research
[14:25:28] <shoky> and what's that  'a, '  part for
[14:25:37] <shoky> $('<img>')  creates an img tag
[14:25:59] <timg__> i know, $('<a>, <img>'), too
[14:26:15] <shoky> huh
[14:26:17] <timg__> but $('a, <img>') not
[14:26:20] <shoky> no idea what you're expecting
[14:27:14] <shoky> it probably tries to parse 'a, <img>' as a selector
[14:28:13] <shoky> As of jQuery 1.9.0 (and unless using the jQuery Migrate plugin), jQuery() requires the HTML string to start with a < (i.e text nodes cannot appear at the front of the HTML string).
[14:32:51] <timg__> shoky: where did you found this?
[14:34:05] <shoky> timg__: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[14:36:21] <timg__> mhm
[14:36:37] <timg__> thanks shoky
[17:32:24] <Lencl> for jquery mobile, am I supposed to be allowed to open popup within a popup?
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> it might not necessarily stop you from doing it.
[17:38:08] <Lencl> it shows no error when I do but it just doesn't work
[17:38:28] <Lencl> the second popup works if it was executed without that first popup
[17:38:42] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[17:38:47] <robertmaxrees> two popups is a really bad idea imo.
[18:00:03] <Mark_2> does anybody know how to create a window interface on a webpage?
[18:00:59] <Mark_2> i want to create something like this :http://imgur.com/Y7NH5pq
[18:02:35] <robertmaxrees> which part of that?
[18:04:09] <Mark_2> um
[18:04:11] <Mark_2> the window part.
[18:07:27] <robertmaxrees> all of it?
[18:07:36] <robertmaxrees> or just that thing that says “MARQUE TAG”?
[18:07:59] <Mark_2> well, basically what i want to do is
[18:08:07] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/Chat2
[18:08:22] <Mark_2> if you click on the ‘loadcontent’ it loads a board.
[18:08:30] <Mark_2> that has list of articles.
[18:08:46] <Mark_2> if you click on the testtest however it loads a page on a different page.
[18:09:01] <Mark_2> i want to load only the content of it on a  window on the same page.
[18:09:11] <Mark_2> but im guessing it’s fairly complicated.
[18:09:17] <Mark_2> i shall ask this question in the cms
[18:09:22] <Mark_2> related websites.
[18:10:34] <robertmaxrees> that would involve ajax
[18:10:44] <robertmaxrees> or trying to use an iframe.

[21:49:40] <dude999> !help, i need to do validation on file upload
[21:49:47] <dude999> so how to do that?
[21:49:56] <dude999> any help would be appreciated.
[21:50:58] <rcyr> What kind of validation?
[21:52:24] <dude999> file input validation
[21:52:34] <dude999> i am not allow to use plugin
[21:53:34] <rcyr> That doesn't help... On newer browsers you can filter by mime types... but on older ones, you're stuck with file extension validation
[21:57:30] <dude999> but it just the front end side of validation when files submitted it will be validate again on the server side
[22:01:43] <rcyr> Of course
[23:13:41] <Mark_2> anybody alive?
