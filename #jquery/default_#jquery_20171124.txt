[00:01:04] <garyserj> I am using this line to load an external page within the current page. $(function(){ $("#includedContent").load("asapschedule_embedded.html"); });   How can I adjust it to load that into a string variable (so I can adjust some characters of it), and load that variable?
[00:50:29] <itsgokul> how can iset value of textbox using query
[00:51:00] <itsgokul> how can iset value of selectbox using query
[01:46:52] <Cork> itsgokul: $('select').val('the value')
[01:47:12] <itsgokul> it does not work for select2 library
[01:47:25] <Cork> ya, as that isn't select elements
[01:47:31] <Cork> you will have to check there api
[02:55:03] <STEVOOO> Do you win any rendering time using $(function() { instead of $( document ).ready(function() {  ?
[02:57:04] <Cork> STEVOOO: no, they are the same thing
[02:57:19] <Cork> STEVOOO: the later is deprecated in newer versions though
[03:22:43] <flowerdts> hey guys, I need to get all the values from an API (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/webservices/rest/search?query=malaria) which is only returning 1k elements/call. So I need to make @200 calls per keyword
[03:23:18] <flowerdts> how do I do this considering asynchronicity?
[03:24:33] <Cork> ouch and xml?
[03:24:42] <Cork> you can't get a json api?
[03:24:50] <flowerdts> I can get json
[03:24:59] <flowerdts> &format=json
[03:25:02] <Cork> for performance i would recommend it
[03:25:06] <Woet> always JSON
[03:25:12] <Woet> XML is terrible
[03:25:15] <flowerdts> I love json too :)
[03:25:16] <Cork> ya
[03:25:41] <Cork> flowerdts: you could use $.when to wait for when all the data is back
[03:25:54] <flowerdts> well, this api is weird
[03:26:05] <flowerdts> when I make a call it returns pageSize elements (max 1000)
[03:26:09] <Cork> $.when($.get(call1), $.get(call2), $.get(call2), $.get(call2), $.get(call2), $.get(call2)).done(function(datas) {})
[03:26:10] <flowerdts> and a nextCursorMark
[03:26:22] <flowerdts> idk how many calls there are
[03:26:34] <Cork> flowerdts: then you can't make them async
[03:26:56] <Cork> flowerdts: you have to make a call parse and handle the response and then chain call a new batch
[03:27:19] <flowerdts> after the first call I get the hitcount so I could run the call hitcount/1000 times
[03:27:30] <flowerdts> but how do I make it wait for each call ?
[03:28:33] <Cork> function next(query) { $.ajax(url, { data: query }).done(function(data) { /* handle data */ next(data.hitcount); }) }; next({})
[03:28:38] <Cork> psudo code but ya
[03:28:45] <Woet> Cork: you should really link to the docs instead of holding everyones hands
[03:28:55] <Woet> flowerdts: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[03:29:10] <Cork> Woet: except the docs won't give you that answer
[03:29:28] <flowerdts> thanks, Cork: just what I needed :)
[03:29:35] <Woet> the docs dont mention the complete callback?
[03:29:36] <Woet> that seems unlikely
[03:29:49] <Cork> Woet: that isn't just the complete callback
[03:29:54] <Cork> it is to chain it
[03:30:06] <Woet> yea.. putting it in a function and calling that function
[03:30:11] <Woet> the very basics of coding
[03:30:21] <Cork> it isn't just calling it it is recursing
[03:30:30] <flowerdts> is recursivity with complete callback, yeah
[03:30:31] <Woet> if you say so
[03:30:40] <Woet> i prefer teaching people instead of just handing them the answer
[03:30:41] <flowerdts> and I think Cork has the right to manage his own time :)
[03:30:42] <Woet> but maybe thats just me
[03:30:58] <Cork> Woet: so do i
[03:31:12] <Woet> we'll see if it works out
[03:31:18] <Cork> we just have different views on what ppl should know before hand
[03:31:23] <Woet> thats alright
[03:43:16] <undefined_bob> but sometimes people are forced to do something without much and/or the requiered knowledge and then they are happy and glad for every hint they get from experienced users like your and c
[03:44:10] <Woet> can you give me an example scenario where someone is forced to code and can't obtain the required knowledge?
[03:45:55] <undefined_bob> i'm the example. which doesnt mean I cant obtain the knowledge but often its just very much you need to know and know how to combine stuff to make things working. and then every little help is great
[03:47:41] <undefined_bob> boss said "hey you, you are doing something with IT. here, make that stuff working" "but boss, I'm just a technician not a coder" "doesnt matter"
[03:48:06] <Woet> thats not forced at all
[03:48:11] <Woet> unless you live in north korea
[03:48:22] <Woet> and that also doesn't exclude learning
[03:48:49] <undefined_bob> forced in a way that I have to do it if I wanna keep my job
[03:49:08] <Woet> then you should probably reconsider your job instead of relying on people on IRC to do your job for you
[03:49:50] <flowerdts> I didn't ask for a full implementation, just for a tip.
[03:50:47] <undefined_bob> no no, like it said it doesnt mean that one/me cant learn it but its pretty much to learn at the beginning. and if you try to make things which are way over your head, its tough. and then again, every hint or push into the right direction from experienced users is very helpfull.
[03:51:51] <undefined_bob> I wouldnt ask for a copy&paste solution, thats not the way how things going and most people here know that, I guess
[03:52:11] <flowerdts> I think you are right :)
[03:52:14] <Woet> you'd be surprised
[03:52:36] <flowerdts> it seems to me that Woet sees things from a dark perspective. I wouldn't wanna be him :)
[03:52:44] <Woet> it is quite cloudy
[03:53:11] <undefined_bob> maybe lots of bad experience in the past
[03:54:09] <flowerdts> I'm not blaming him, in the meantime, I got the solution to work so that was very good advice
[03:55:40] <undefined_bob> for example, for today my goal is to learn how to loop a variable in the way I need it. I'll read a lot and try much but if I still didn't know how to archiv it in the evening, I would carefully ask here for a hint
[03:55:48] <undefined_bob> thats what I mean
[03:56:04] <undefined_bob> I think no one want to blame anyone here :)
[05:07:18] <flowerdts> guys, I have this `batch('*')    Highcharts.chart('container', {})`
[05:07:28] <flowerdts> I must plot the data that batch processes
[05:07:48] <flowerdts> how do I wait for batch to be over?
[05:08:28] <Cork> depends on what batch takes as arguments and what it returns
[05:10:36] <flowerdts> it returns nothing and it takes nextCursorMarker as input
[05:12:40] <Cork> flowerdts: that doesn't mean anything to anyone that doesn't know what the function does
[05:13:32] <flowerdts> ok, sorry. the function is fetching data from api and filtering the data
[05:13:44] <flowerdts> and then I want to draw a graph when the data is processed
[05:13:56] <Cork> flowerdts: you either have to paste the code in ex. jsfiddle.net or you're own your own
[05:14:33] <flowerdts> https://pastebin.com/bWbzY5D1
[05:15:31] <Cork> ok, that function provides no way to wait for the result except by modding it
[05:32:03] <undefined_bob> is it possible to add an element like an id with .attr instead of only changing it?
[05:33:33] <Cork> undefined_bob: sure
[05:34:08] <undefined_bob> thanks
[05:43:45] <raul782> Hi, I've managed to get an external image (CORS enabled) so I can inject it into a form,
[05:43:57] <raul782> however, I have the following issue
[05:44:08] <raul782> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39592752/read-image-from-url-upload
[05:44:36] <raul782> I get:  byteString.length is not a function
[05:45:47] <Cork> raul782: then check what typeof(byteString) is
[05:45:52] <Cork> i suspect it is null or undefined
[05:46:21] <raul782> let me see
[05:46:56] <raul782> it returns Atob
[05:48:42] <raul782> humm, wait
[05:50:00] <raul782> it returned string
[05:50:21] <raul782> but when looking at the contents
[05:50:31] <raul782> it's like garbled content
[05:50:44] <raul782> like this type of content ÿØÿà
[06:00:31] <Cork> raul782: then .length shouold work just fine
[06:00:47] <Cork> oh wait
[06:00:49] <Cork> not a function
[06:00:59] <Cork> so you ran byteString.length() ?
[06:01:00] <raul782> I'm using coffeescript btw
[06:01:11] <Cork> so it is most likely coffiescript breaking
[06:01:53] <Cork> check what javascript it is generating
[06:02:05] <Cork> i would suspect you will find byteString.length() in there
[06:02:38] <raul782> right let me check
[06:02:57] <Cork> (i for the life of me can't understand why ppl use coffiescript...)
[06:03:08] <raul782> legacy :/
[06:03:31] <Cork> no i meant from the start
[06:03:58] <Cork> when the rails guys revealed coffiescript my response was "why, whats the point" :)
[06:04:26] <Cork> the only reason i've ever found was "i don't like participants and it doens't look like ruby" :/
[06:04:57] <Cork> i don't blame ppl from using it, so don't take it as critic ^^'
[06:06:14] <raul782> so weird, the emitted code is fine
[06:06:37] <raul782> byteString.length
[06:11:29] <Cork> donno what happens there then, if the variable content is a string .length should always exist
[06:18:25] <iamarun> i have this medicine inventory page : in it there are items , and each item is generated using json from server . i have to calculate grand total , and also add functionality that can add and remove items. The problem is that i use count stored in an hidden field. now if the user removes 3 and 4 is present . please help
[06:19:29] <iamarun> should i deal with the data on the server side and should i make all field items of 3 null or " "
[07:02:26] <undefined_bob> one have a hint for me why this function seems to do nothing when I try it on my test page? (ignore the .each part, that might not work yet) https://jsfiddle.net/61bve1w5/3/
[07:05:24] <Cork> undefined_bob: what part isn't working?
[07:06:03] <undefined_bob> I assume the first two lines because it just do nothing
[07:06:28] <Cork> undefined_bob: what does $('.static2').length give you?
[07:12:11] <thykka> undefined_bob, what are you expecting it to do?
[07:12:19] <thykka> looks like the ID does come up as intended
[07:13:06] <undefined_bob> I try to figure out how to display the result of .length
[07:13:56] <thykka> i don't see what that has to do with your fiddle :O
[07:14:24] <undefined_bob> I expect that it add to my div an id="variable_name"
[07:14:29] <thykka> which happens
[07:14:49] <thykka> how are you loading the script? in a DOMContentLoaded event, inline, or..?
[07:14:56] <undefined_bob> c asked me about the value of it
[07:15:18] <undefined_bob> I put it in the head <script type="text/javascript">
[07:15:20] <thykka> right
[07:15:32] <thykka> okay, if it's in the head, the script might run before the page has loaded
[07:15:47] <thykka> so from the script's point of view, there is no .static2 on the page yet
[07:16:13] <Cork> undefined_bob: just do console.log($('.static2').length)
[07:16:21] <undefined_bob> you can see here line 17-20 http://undefined.bplaced.net/das-sind-wir/index.html
[07:16:39] <thykka> either move the script into <body> after the elements you wish to modify, OR add a load event listener before you try to access DOM
[07:16:40] <Cork> if that gives you 0 in the console on your page then your selector doesn't work
[07:17:41] <thykka> i'll bet $5 that it's length is 0
[07:17:50] <Cork> ya
[07:17:54] <Cork> it is
[07:18:06] <Cork> it can't find anything as body will be empty
[07:18:17] <thykka> `next
[07:18:22] <Cork> (it has to be unless the parser is psychic)
[07:19:52] <undefined_bob> this gave me undefined back
[07:20:25] <Cork> undefined_bob: just wrapp the code you talked about in the jquery ready handler
[07:20:54] <undefined_bob> you mean because the script is executed too early?
[07:21:01] <thykka> exactly
[07:21:11] <Cork> see what we talked about 4 mins ago
[07:21:46] <Cork> undefined_bob: when a page loads the browser parses the stream as it comes in
[07:22:05] <Cork> undefined_bob: and when a script close tag is hit the code inside the script tag is sent to the javascript engine
[07:22:23] <Cork> undefined_bob: and as this is before the element, and event before the body it will not find anything as nothing will exist
[07:22:31] <Cork> event==even
[07:22:50] <undefined_bob> ow yes, that make sense
[07:23:35] <undefined_bob> I'll read abou the ready handler, thank you two
[07:24:06] <Cork> undefined_bob: you've never used $(function() {}) before??
[07:24:41] <Cork> undefined_bob: http://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery3
[07:25:19] <undefined_bob> not by my self. I read about it and I often read code containing that but I always stick away from jq/js
[07:25:48] <undefined_bob> I feel a little bit embarrassed/ashamed now
[07:26:27] <thykka> well, sucking at something is the first step of being kinda good at something
[07:26:29] <Cork> undefined_bob: i'm more impressed you've gotten things to work :)
[07:27:04] <undefined_bob> thanks, that's very kind
[07:28:08] <Cork> but ya if one is comming from other languages the need to wait for the dom to stabilize is a kinda weird concept
[07:30:14] <undefined_bob> I really try to improve myself. its just a little bit much during the last past month. I had to learn a lot about css and a language called ccml and now I have things to do which I can only? solve with js/jq. But I'm also always curious about new things, so I just keep trying and learning :)
[07:31:53] <undefined_bob> but it make sense that the script need to wait for the dom to be ready. I admit, I had some difficults understanding "what a dom is" at all. but its better now
[07:33:06] <undefined_bob> but now time for lunch and then I try it with the ready handler. thank you all :)
[07:34:08] <Neo2> Hi
[07:34:35] <Neo2> I make plugin http://kselax.ru/test/
[07:34:57] <Neo2> it's work on jQuery, everybody can test
[07:35:10] <Neo2> It's working*
[07:36:03] <Neo2> What is my level of jQuery, am I expert if I do this? http://prntscr.com/hentl0
[07:36:55] <Neo2> there sum functions generate errors and I've wrapped them on try catch is it normally?
[07:37:52] <Neo2> Lazy seek on code and find error, easier put code inside try block and in catch output nothing
[07:39:30] <thykka> expert if you do what?
[07:39:50] <Neo2> this code I've been doing from morning, It's getting tired now
[07:39:53] <Cork> thykka: he is a lot into grades and certificates
[07:40:12] <Neo2> thykka: this code on jQuery http://kselax.ru/test/
[07:40:25] <thykka> if you're an expert, you probably don't need to ask others about it :P
[07:40:42] <Cork> Neo2: like i said last you where on about this, you're an expert when you can do jobs you need to get done without struggling
[07:40:53] <Neo2> thykka: There is complex code for <select> tag, I think not everybody able to do it
[07:41:09] <thykka> Neo2, an expert would make the code simple ;)
[07:41:26] <thykka> complexity is generally something to avoid, rather than a measure of expertise
[07:41:53] <Cork> most amount of bang with least amount of code :)
[07:42:10] <Cork> (and most readable amount of code)
[07:42:21] <thykka> yeah.. because every line of code introduces the possibility for new bugs, and more code to maintain
[07:42:42] <Cork> and more code for new maintainers to read and understand
[07:43:50] <Neo2> thykka: I'm trying as soon as possible did this code, but nevertheless it took much time, from morning I'm struggling
[07:44:00] <thykka> then you're not an expert
[07:44:03] <Neo2> I use now new conception do all in OOP
[07:44:07] <Neo2> thykka: see this http://prntscr.com/henx37
[07:44:46] <Neo2> thykka: I will be use it now, all put inside classes and automatically load those classes
[07:45:11] <thykka> what else uses these classes?
[07:45:17] <Neo2> this code that I did in this project I will reuse in new projects
[07:46:20] <Neo2> thykka: it's WP plugin, that output this code, and it's my first new boilerframe or frame
[07:47:11] <Neo2> thykka: I want put it public and give people estimate my OOP in #php, but some bitch banned me there
[07:48:34] <Neo2> thykka: Hope new structure make me to do code faster and reuse it many times
[08:49:44] <dimi1947> I have some jquery code that it does not work and the weird is that the console produces no error...how I could possbly debug it?
[08:56:07] <Cork> dimi1947: what is the code that isn't working?
[08:56:09] <pavonia> Add more console debug messages
[08:56:25] <Cork> and if it is selector based make sure the selector matches
[08:56:55] <Cork> (that is the most common cause of problems like this)
[08:57:10] <dimi1947> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/q4uy6p44/ jspane line 4...on clicking the edit button,,,the input boxes ought to be removed...but the do not
[08:57:39] <Cork> dimi1947: console.log($( ".wrapper_servp:nth-last-child(2)" ).length)
[08:57:46] <Cork> if it is 0 then you know your problem
[08:58:21] <Cork> dimi1947: also note nth-last-child counts children not of that type
[08:58:50] <Cork> so you should read ".wrapper_servp:nth-last-child(2)" as "remove the second to last element if it has the class .wrapper_servp"
[08:58:56] <dimi1947> Cork:one by one...
[09:00:18] <dimi1947> Cork:so you are saying the code is not going to work anyway..is this what are you telling me?
[09:00:37] <Cork> i'm telling you that is why that line of code isn't working
[09:01:13] <dimi1947> I did not quite understand that...
[09:01:40] <Cork> dimi1947: also you have a trailing </div> in the code
[09:02:10] <dimi1947> Cork:what do you mean with the word "trailing"?
[09:02:28] <Cork> an </div> with out a starting tag
[09:02:35] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/q4uy6p44/128/
[09:04:28] <Cork> dimi1947: that missing <div> that i added meant that :nth-last-child(1) was the <table> and :nth-last-child(2) was the .buttons
[09:04:35] <Cork> dimi1947: so the selector didn't match anything
[09:04:57] <dimi1947> Cork:Now I am starting to getting the picture
[09:05:16] <Cork> dimi1947: if you want the "last of the class you can't use nth-child
[09:05:58] <dimi1947> Cork:then what to use...I want the 2 last input boxes removed...as you have understood
[09:06:23] <Cork> dimi1947: is the button relative to the input box?
[09:06:30] <Cork> or do you have one generic for the entire list?
[09:07:02] <dimi1947> Cork:to which button you are referring to...clarify it please
[09:07:15] <Cork> the one that should remove the input box
[09:08:52] <dimi1947> and what to you mean relative...the botton tha is supposed to do that is the cancel button...just for testing I have  placed the code in the edit handler
[09:09:21] <Cork> dimi1947: is it relative to the input box in the tree or like a button in a toolbar or something like that
[09:09:40] <Cork> dimi1947: the reason i ask is if it is relative you can work from $(this) and get a MUCH more stable selector
[09:10:02] <dimi1947> Cork:it is in the tree...
[09:10:10] <Cork> sigh...
[09:10:13] <Cork> i didn't ask that
[09:10:18] <Cork> of course it is in the tree...
[09:10:41] <Cork> but is it relative to the row you want to modify
[09:10:49] <Cork> or a generic button somewhere else in the page
[09:10:53] <Cork> (like a tooblar)
[09:12:00] <dimi1947> Cork:now I am confused...it is cancel button within the fieldset where these input boxes are located...
[09:12:37] <Cork> dimi1947: so $(this).closest('fieldset').find('input') should work?
[09:13:21] <dimi1947> Cork:can you edit the fiddle please so I can see it with the rest of the code...namy thanks
[09:13:43] <Cork> i don't know what i'm modifying as all the images are missing
[09:15:04] <dimi1947> Cork:the usual problem...there must be a problem with the hosting service
[09:15:35] <Cork> looks like they point to a local live.com image account
[09:15:39] <Cork> with none public images
[09:16:05] <dimi1947> Cork:can you wait a little so I can try to fix the issue?
[09:17:26] <dimi1947> or just try to edit the JSpane without necessarily trying to see the images...if possible
[09:20:33] <dimi1947> I do not  know how to fix the issue with the images for now...can you edit the fiddle anyway?
[09:26:40] <dimi1947> and where exactly did you put that missing div?
[09:31:01] <dimi1947> I found the missing div after all...
[09:31:22] <undefined_bob> I tried to get it working with document.ready and with window.on load. I also tried to place the script to various positions like head, body, end of body. but the result of console.log was always undefined. could it be possible, that the script doesnt work because of other scripts, which also affect the div? but then it should work if I run the new script after the others, right? https://jsfiddle.net/61bve1w5/7/
[09:31:42] <DarsVaeda> hey, not sure if this is a bootstrap or jquery issue. I'm using bootstap 4. I have an element that includes elements that are col-6. it is initially hidden with display: none. if I show them with jquery.toggle() instead of being next to each other they are below each other. if I display them initially they show up as expected. does that ring a bell?
[09:34:03] <Cork> undefined_bob: jsfiddle only helps in this case if you can reproduce the problem there
[09:34:45] <undefined_bob> I know that was just to show the code I tried with
[09:34:48] <Cork> DarsVaeda: ya, it is cause toggle and .show() depends on .hide to set the correct display type
[09:35:04] <Cork> DarsVaeda: i would recommend adding a class and use toggleClass to show/hide the element
[09:35:20] <Neo2> pavonia: ;)
[09:35:29] <DarsVaeda> Cork: ah okay, thanks :)
[09:36:31] <undefined_bob> live example would be here http://undefined.bplaced.net/das-sind-wir/index.html  the script is at line 18-23 and the first div with the target class is at line 210
[09:39:01] <Cork> undefined_bob: works "fine" here <div class="balkenclosed" id=""unser TeamQualitätZentrale & VertriebsbürosUnternehmensbroschüreI gonna be a map, one day">
[09:39:32] <Cork> undefined_bob: you're grabbing the text of all the occurrences of .balkenclosed and that is prob why it isn't doing what you want
[09:41:10] <undefined_bob> ow
[09:41:20] <undefined_bob> for it still look like it does just nothing
[09:41:56] <undefined_bob> what have you done to make it working at all for you?
[09:42:04] <Cork> undefined_bob: run $('.balkenclosed').prop('outerHTML')
[09:42:07] <Cork> in a console
[09:42:56] <Cork> (why you want to push element text content into an id i don't understand but ok...)
[09:44:19] <dimi1947> Cork:I am testing the code you gave me...the only problem is always a specific numbers of divs must be removed
[09:44:43] <undefined_bob> oh I can explain, because that id should work as a fragment url. the each element text content is perfect for a #url
[09:45:11] <Cork> then why aren't you doing this server side?
[09:46:07] <undefined_bob> if I manually add an id and enter the url with the # at the end, the content is scrolled in scope and the accordion with that id open
[09:46:30] <undefined_bob> I have no real access to the server except ftp
[09:46:42] <Cork> ya, i know how anchors work
[09:46:57] <undefined_bob> I didnt before I read about :o
[09:46:57] <Cork> so you have no server scripting support at all?
[09:47:34] <undefined_bob> hm its a server hosted by a common big hoster
[09:47:45] <Cork> ya, doesn't really matter
[09:48:05] <Cork> but if you can run script server side (ex. php) you can just generate and set these ids so the page works even without js
[09:48:15] <undefined_bob> but I have no other credentials than for ftp
[09:48:27] <Cork> what does that have to do with anything?
[09:48:58] <undefined_bob> no idea, I thought it would be requierd
[09:49:05] <Cork> no
[09:49:13] <undefined_bob> php is supported by the server
[09:49:26] <Cork> server scripting is just text files similar to .html except the server has a parser that reads and acts based on them
[09:49:57] <Cork> then i would do this kind of thing server side as you generate the menu
[09:50:54] <undefined_bob> is it too difficult with javascript?
[09:51:17] <Cork> you get a page that is broken until javascript fixes it up
[09:51:38] <Cork> and that is bad practis
[09:52:28] <undefined_bob> yes, I was thinking a lot out it if the anchor even work. I mean will the script which add the id be loaded in the second the user hit enter?
[09:53:02] <undefined_bob> *-out it
[10:30:20] <fas3r> Hello
[10:35:58] <fas3r> I'm trying to use history.pushState, however when doing console.log(history.state), it show only one entry even if I call it several time. Any idea . Thank you.
[11:30:55] <dimi1947> Cork:if you can look again my problem please
[11:32:08] <dimi1947> it is half-complete
[19:25:45] <jnewt> i'm trying to do something like this: $(this).siblings('.dd')[0].children('.dd_sel')[0].append("<SOME HTML");  the .children part fails  chrome debugger shows the div to have children, and one with the '.dd_sel' class
[19:26:06] <robertmaxrees> [0] is your issue.
[19:26:17] <robertmaxrees> that's converting it to a DOM node, so you lose the jquery object.
[19:26:36] <robertmaxrees> you want .eq(0) instead
[19:26:58] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, find a different way to get what you want.
[19:27:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:27:36] <jnewt> robertmaxrees, is there a more direct way than traversing around like this?
[19:27:57] <robertmaxrees> jnewt I'd have to seee your markup.
[19:30:28] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle or something would be super helpful jnewt
[23:17:55] <Al_nz1> I am experimenting with converting to windows server.
[23:18:32] <Al_nz1> how would a remote user join the domain for the first time. they already havev vpn access via a seperate server
[23:57:19] <Al_nz1> maybe i need to set vpn to connect before logon
