[08:35:20] <OliPicard> Quick question, Just wondering is there any easy way of importing csv files into html5 tables using ajax/jquery?
[08:35:27] <OliPicard> or a javascript libaray
[08:41:54] <peterR``> OliPicard, no idea, but it is pretty easy to code up something in C or C++
[08:45:08] <decx> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/g5hfus33/
[08:55:21] <OliPicard> peterR``: I found someone has already made a pretty good template.

[09:21:47] <skinux> Does this channel support use of jQuery plugins or just jQuery itself?
[09:23:09] <Uhkis> skinux: just ask your actual question
[09:24:05] <skinux> Trying to get this grid to show up, just a blank grid. https://gist.github.com/skinuxgeek/4fd54aad533c31f54332
[09:24:53] <skinux> I don't have any json request handling setup for it yet, but there is a little bit of hard-coding so I think a blank grid should show.
[09:36:38] <isthisreallife> hmm
[09:37:52] <skinux> I don't see why it's not showing even a blank grid.
[09:55:28] <skinux> Just can't seem to figure out how to get the grid to show.
[09:59:47] <Kartagis> what is the difference between a POST request and a GET request? is it that the request returns something as a result of a GET request?
[10:02:16] <skinux> GET is intended for requesting a page/data from the server, POST is intended for sending data to the server to be processed.
[10:04:22] <Kartagis> exactly my thought
[10:04:53] <Kartagis> so, why do you make a GET request to YouTube?
[10:09:08] <Kartagis> because you get replies back?
[10:23:50] <Uhkis> you make lots of get requests on every site you visit
[11:12:23] <total_noob> hello room
[11:13:35] <total_noob> I am very new to jquery and json
[11:13:49] <total_noob> i was wondering if anyone could help me
[11:14:52] <total_noob> i want to get hold of the attribute 'location' from this http://twittercounter.com/pages/api so i can display it on a web page
[11:15:31] <total_noob> as i have said i am very new to this i have read w3 schools and through a few examples on stack but no avail
[11:33:28] <total_noob> is anyone online willing to help a noob?
[11:36:25] <ceramicskulls> total_noob ?
[11:38:34] <total_noob> yeah
[11:40:25] <ceramicskulls> total_noob ask your question
[11:40:29] <ceramicskulls> that's the point of coming in here
[11:40:31] <ceramicskulls> ....
[11:44:36] <total_noob> I am trying to display the location of a twitter user using this api : http://twittercounter.com/pages/api
[11:45:01] <total_noob> i have read around on json but cant get my head around it
[11:45:36] <ceramicskulls> total_noob: Are you already receiving the results?
[11:46:24] <total_noob> if i type the url in to the address bar yes
[11:46:32] <total_noob> i get a json object
[11:46:50] <total_noob> here is an example
[11:47:00] <ceramicskulls> Kk, but you need to receive the results in your code, not in the addess bar
[11:47:09] <total_noob> http://api.twittercounter.com/?apikey=e9335031a759f251ee9b4e2e6634e1c5&twitter_id=TheCounter
[11:47:33] <total_noob> yeah i dont know how to do that
[11:47:46] <ceramicskulls> heh, do you know jquery at all?
[11:49:04] <total_noob> can you help me with that?
[11:49:07] <ceramicskulls> Cause it's going to be complicated to explain if you don't know jquery and would suggest hiring some one that does or spending the time to learn
[11:49:28] <total_noob> no not really tbh
[11:50:32] <ceramicskulls> Do you know HTML?
[11:51:50] <ceramicskulls> http://api.jquery.com/ - if you want to start learning, for something like this, you can use ajax calls to return the json and use $.each to output the results - but this is probably going to be confusing for you
[11:52:18] <ceramicskulls> Depending on what you're doing this for and how much time you have, I really do suggest hiring some one that can help you

[12:51:53] <Doxin> so jquery-ui draggables can only be dragged once for some reason. I'm using jquery 1.11.3 and jquery-ui 1.11.4.

[13:13:00] <skinux> Anyone familiar with JQX Grid plugin? From jqwidgets.com
[13:27:39] <DjinnASD> can someone help me understand these default options and where they come from (are they from google?). im newbie https://github.com/bradoyler/GoogleCalReader-jquery-plugin
[14:14:42] <tash> I think I could use some help with an xhr get. Haven't done this in a long time. http://pastebin.com/TgXKx8U5
[14:15:45] <tash> the script that it is calling returns "successfully connected" b/c all it is at the moment is a connection to the db and tells me it succeeds.  I'm not getting my console.log's to actually log anything.  Wondering what I'm doing wrong.
[14:16:35] <tash> isan't "data" in this context whatever my script returns?
[14:18:41] <tash> isn't*
[14:30:26] <tash> looks like the problem is that it is trying to hit ../modules/pto_check.php instead of ../handlers/pto_check.php.  I specified the proper script now http://pastebin.com/NKDAqVx3 but it still hits modules/pto_check.php for some reason.
[14:30:28] <tash> any ideas?
[14:31:13] <tash> in firebug it's clear that it is hitting modules/pto_check.php?name=etc etc etc ... when I change modules to handlers in the address bar it works fine and returns what I want
[14:33:34] <tash> why would $.get be trying to hit a page differnet than what I'm specifying? Its like it is defaulting to itself
[14:52:50] <tash> anyone around today? :)
[15:30:33] <shoky_> tash: still need help?
[15:31:23] <tash> yes :)
[15:31:36] <tash> I've been doing other things in the meantime, and checking back here every now and again
[15:32:02] <shoky_> tash: oks, try changing your event handler. instead of a click handler on the submit button, change it to a submit handler on the form element
[15:33:17] <shoky_> and in the submit handler function you get an argument which is the event object, on which you should call .preventDefault() to prevent the form itself from submitting
[15:33:25] <shoky_> assuming i'm guessing right about the issue...
[15:33:35] <tash> you probably are
[15:33:47] <shoky_> is your original page modules/pto_check.php  ?
[15:33:50] <tash> so, change $("#submit").click to ?
[15:33:58] <tash> yes, original page is modules/pto_check.php
[15:34:02] <shoky_> $('form').submit
[15:34:05] <tash> ah
[15:34:08] <tash> ok, hang tight
[15:34:19] <shoky_> $('form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ... })
[15:34:34] <shoky_> ( .submit(..) is same as .on('submit, ..)  )
[15:35:44] <tash> so like: http://pastebin.com/v3R8eyMD
[15:35:45] <tash> ?
[15:35:55] <shoky_> yep
[15:35:58] <tash> k, testing
[15:35:59] <tash> sec
[15:37:53] <tash> cool, that worked ... well, to the point of returning some very basic "Successfully connected" message. I still need to add my actualy logic to select from the DB and stuff
[15:38:05] <shoky_> sweet
[15:38:19] <tash> which, I think I'll work on later...it's about time to eat and we are at family's house so I better not be too much of an anti social dude
[15:38:22] <tash> thanks a bunch shoky!
[15:38:38] <shoky_> sure thing. bon apetit
[15:38:45] <tash> nomnom

[15:48:00] <socialblogsite> what event do I hook a dialog to ask for confirmation when the user tries to edit a field? I tried on focus, but everytime the dialog closes, the field gets focused again and the dialog pops up again, in an infinite loop. I tried on change, but it might not trigger until the form is submitted if the user doesn’t jump to another field…
[16:34:30] <feathersanddown> argh, how to correctly upload files using ajax ? still can't see any value in php
[16:34:40] <feathersanddown> using $.post() is enough?

[16:35:32] <blackwhite> can someone tell me exactly why I can’t seem to spawn the video in the right size on this test page here http://www.ghostnoteapp.com/new-index.php
[16:35:41] <blackwhite> I am using this http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/
[16:36:00] <rcyr> feathersanddown: You need XHR2 to upload files
[16:36:09] <blackwhite> it should work with just adding the link but instead having a set width it just make it full screen
[16:41:37] <feathersanddown> rcyr thanks :)

[17:07:14] <socialblogsite> what event do I hook a dialog to ask for confirmation when the user tries to edit a field? I tried on focus, but everytime the dialog closes, the field gets focused again and the dialog pops up again, in an infinite loop. I tried on change, but it might not trigger until the form is submitted if the user doesn’t jump to another field…
[17:07:43] <socialblogsite> I tried change() inside a focus() but the dialog triggers in both.
[17:38:08] <blackwhite> never mind i solved it
[19:22:11] <Jittler> Got a long string from .serialize and want to pull each name/value pair out. Any clue how to do this?
[19:22:38] <Velveeta> look into $.deparam
[19:23:08] <Jittler> If my goal is to turn each thing into a variable with that name and value; should I be using .serializeArray instead?
[19:23:13] <shoky_> `api $.serializeArray
[19:23:14] <b-ot> shoky_: No matches.
[19:23:19] <shoky_> doh.
[19:23:34] <Jittler> ?
[19:23:41] <Velveeta> also, listen to whatever shoky says, because i've been drinking and he's a smart cookie
[19:23:51] <shoky_> sounds to me like serializeArray is what you want, yea
[19:27:40] <Jittler> I sorted it out. This was very helpful, if anyone is interested: http://jsfiddle.net/nick_craver/6wYQS/
[19:29:00] <Velveeta> yep, looks like you got what you needed there :)
[19:42:11] <tash> shoky_ you around?
[19:42:38] <shoky_> tash yeah for a bit
[19:43:19] <tash> so if I want to console.log(data);  what actually determines what "data" is?  If my php script echo's something back, isn't that technically data in this context?
[19:44:33] <Velveeta> data will depend entirely on the context of what you're executing
[19:44:52] <shoky_> tash: see the "dataType" argument docs here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/  for full info
[19:44:58] <Velveeta> if you're talking about a response to an ajax request, then yes, data will be whatever your php script echos
[19:45:03] <shoky_> dataType (default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html))
[19:45:41] <shoky_> tash: it depends mainly on the content-type header your server responds with
[19:46:37] <shoky_> unless you specify your own dataType argument to $.ajax
[19:46:53] <shoky_> you can force it to treat it as text, for example
[19:48:51] <tash> ok
[19:49:15] <shoky_> tash but yes if you're just asking generally if data there is what your php returns, then yeah ;p
[19:51:27] <tash> the script I'm calling with my GET is checking to see if there are already rows that exist in the datbase with a specific "start_date", and if so, I'm returning a string like "already exists".  If there is already a row that exists I basically want to alert the user that this is the case.
[19:54:46] <shoky_> that's fine. a very typical way to do this nowadays is to have your server respond with a JSON response. that way you can easily have different named fields if needed, or just any structured data
[19:56:03] <shoky_> and then data in the ajax callback would be a js object representing that json
[19:56:18] <tash> ok, will have to look into that
[19:58:37] <shoky_> i'm off. gnight
[20:00:03] <mdev> goodnight shoky
[20:00:20] <Velveeta> right, the other nice thing about responding with a json object is that it's extensible, so if you want to add props to it in the future, it's already set up for that, rather than having to switch dataTypes from string to json at that point
[20:05:06] <Jittler> I'm completely lost here, folks. Not a PHP guy. I made an array of name/value pairs and sent it through POST but can't seem to access the stuff on the other (php) side.
[20:05:26] <Jittler> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NqXjeR?editors=101
[20:06:31] <Jittler> $_POST[ 'dataObj['field-name']' ] or something?
[20:06:33] <Woet> Jittler: and what makes you think it's an issue with your JS?
[20:07:03] <Woet> Jittler: a) ##php b) http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php
[20:07:04] <Jittler> I don't think it's a problem with the js, I just posted the codepen so you can see what I'm doing. How do I read the name and value in the PHP after POST?
[20:07:20] <Jittler> Yeah, makes sense. Heading to ##php.
[20:09:41] <Velveeta> i don't think it's the JS either, i think you're just trying to reference it wrong on the php side
[20:10:21] <Velveeta> try a var_dump of $_POST... http://php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php
[20:10:30] <Velveeta> that'll show you the structure you'll want to dereference
[20:50:45] <Hebron> $.post("/email", ...);
[20:50:53] <Hebron> is that "/email" part valid?
[20:50:58] <Velveeta> yep
[20:51:00] <Hebron> sweet <3
[20:52:13] <synapt> Hebron: Keep in mind though it's an absolute reference, meaning the browser will look for /email at the base root of the domain (eg; foobar.com/email)
[20:52:25] <Hebron> yup
[20:52:28] <Hebron> that's intended
[21:04:53] <halftheman> helo
[22:52:46] <Hebron> if I have a string: {status:Success, message:Email added}
[22:52:58] <Hebron>  how can I easily turn that into something I can refer to as myVar['status'] or myVar['message'] ?
[23:06:36] <Hebron>  $.post("/email", {email: $("#email").val()}, function(data){ console.log(data) });
[23:06:44] <Hebron> that posts to the console properly
[23:07:03] <Hebron> but when I add:  $.post("/email", {email: $("#email").val()}, function(data){ console.log(data['status']);}); it says undefined
[23:07:22] <Hebron> but console.log prints {"status":"Success", "message":"blahblah"}
[23:07:40] <Hebron> can someone help me figure out why I can't access data['status'] or data['message'] ?
[23:07:50] <Woet> Hebron: you're not parsing the JSON.
[23:08:02] <Woet> Hebron: that's why console.log prints JSON instead of an object.
[23:08:13] <Hebron> it SHOULD print json though
[23:08:22] <Woet> it is.
[23:08:32] <Hebron> don't you access a json object like data['status'] ?
[23:08:37] <Woet> you do
[23:08:43] <Hebron> so then why is that undefined?
[23:08:46] <Woet> but as your console.log tells you, "data" is a JSON string.
[23:08:48] <Woet> not an object.
[23:08:57] <Hebron> oh it needs to be a json object?
[23:09:07] <Woet> yes.
[23:09:56] <Hebron> thanks Woet <3
[23:10:02] <Woet> jQuery tries to guess what you're returning, but apparently you're not sending the right headers.
[23:10:35] <Woet> if /email actually sent Content-Type: application/json, jquery would automatically parse the JSON
[23:10:51] <Woet> or if you told jQuery it's JSON using dataType, it will also automatically parse it
[23:23:57] <compact> http://pastebin.com/iCqRAacX
[23:24:00] <compact> any idea why its not working?
[23:24:03] <compact> nothing I'm missing?
[23:24:43] <Woet> compact: "its not working" is not useful.
[23:24:51] <Woet> compact: and www.jsfiddle.net
[23:27:05] <Cork> compact: what Woet
[23:27:19] <Cork> *'s trying to say is we need the html
[23:27:34] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/h8t7gs0t/
[23:28:16] <Cork> compact: it's an id not a class
[23:29:34] <Woet> well that was simple.
[23:29:52] <compact> hm, but on my local (bit more js etc added), not working
[23:30:05] <Cork> compact: did you change the selector?
[23:30:16] <compact> yuh to #
[23:30:36] <Cork> any errors in the browser console?
[23:41:58] <compact> na no errors
[23:42:06] <compact> other JS errors. so not sure if its stopping because of that
[23:42:12] <compact> however all the other JS works fine
[23:42:29] <Cork> compact: if you have any js error then ya, you need to fix those
[23:51:55] <halftheman> I WANT TO KNOOOW
[23:56:08] <compact> Cork, could it be because there are multiple "trailer_type" selects
[23:58:45] <Cork> compact: multiple selectors doesn't matter no
[23:58:57] <Cork> compact: if you have multiple elements with the same id, then ya that won't work
