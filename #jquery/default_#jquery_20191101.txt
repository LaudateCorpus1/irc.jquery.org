[00:38:51] <loganlee> fixed had to use hasClass()
[01:04:48] <loganlee> can someone have a look at this https://jsfiddle.net/fvr10ubo/1/
[02:01:54] <Cork> loganlee: https://jsfiddle.net/8wcf79eu/
[02:02:12] <Cork> $.expr is depricated and dropped in 3.2+

[08:34:23] <primitivMedia> i have an on key function that runs my fullname function
[08:34:34] <primitivMedia> it works fine when i only have the if(result === true) statement
[08:34:47] <primitivMedia> but I added one to check if the string is empty to spit out a different error message
[08:35:01] <primitivMedia> when i do that, my code doesnt work anymore it just checks if its empty and thats it
[08:36:43] <primitivMedia> is it because ive always returned true?
[08:36:49] <primitivMedia> already **
[11:49:24] <agile_prg> hi all, I am loading a json string from the server with a json call, I would like a way to verify that it has loaded correctly, is there some way to do a checksum # to make sure it loaded right?
[12:01:07] <taplar> agile_prg how to do a checksum would be more of a ##javascript question
[12:02:26] <taplar> but a quick google: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7616461/generate-a-hash-from-string-in-javascript
[12:34:43] <MikeD_> should foo.css("min-width","300px") work to make the minimum width 300 pixels?
[12:37:05] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sfgezr71/ :)
[12:37:46] <MikeD_> does this apply here: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-foo-css-min-width-fix-for-internet-explorer
[12:38:12] <robertmaxrees> that's 13 years old.
[12:39:02] <robertmaxrees> can you clarify what issue you're having?
[12:41:24] <MikeD_> hmm
[12:42:26] <MikeD_> i have a plotly graph being rendered into a div that i'm setting a width on via mydiv.css( "width", "75%") that works, but it seems mydiv.css("min-width","300px") does not work.
[12:42:38] <robertmaxrees> what browser?
[12:42:56] <MikeD_> now that i've seen the example (thanks) i might be chasing an issue with plotly not caring about the div's min-width
[12:42:58] <robertmaxrees> also: have you inspected the element to see what's overriding that CSS?  or what you're even applyiong it at all?
[12:43:11] <MikeD_> i should show this without feeding it to the plotly lib
[12:43:30] <robertmaxrees> you can quickly try to set overflow: hidden on that div and see if that's the case.
[12:48:29] <MikeD_> i guess it's working... i just don't have as visceral and intuitive a picture of 300px as i did when i was regularly doing more layout work
[12:48:42] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:53:59] <MikeD_> on another note... i just saw a pull request review comment that said font size should be in em not px "so that they honor individual users screen resolutions/zooms etc."
[12:54:10] <robertmaxrees> link?
[12:54:21] <robertmaxrees> or is this on another repo?
[12:54:21] <MikeD_> is that still a thing, or has the world moved on from that 'em' craziness
[12:54:32] <MikeD_> it's internal
[12:55:00] <robertmaxrees> it's... not that straightforward.  ideally you'd use em.
[12:55:09] <MikeD_> haven't browsers been 'zooming' px for a decade too
[12:55:09] <robertmaxrees> but there are cases to be made to not use them.
[12:55:36] <robertmaxrees> you can handle that with px, but ems make it much easier to reason about how different screen sizes etc are handled.
[12:57:33] <MikeD_> yeah, i get the theory... and if we had built everything in em from the start, it wouldn't matter... but showing up late to the party and saying "font size units should be 'em' " seems arbitrary and likely to cause problems
[12:57:45] <robertmaxrees> eh, it all depends.
[12:57:51] <robertmaxrees> it's certainly easier if you start with all ems.
[12:57:51] <MikeD_> yup
[12:57:56] <robertmaxrees> or if you're planning on migrating to px.
[12:58:14] <MikeD_> we don't "plan" anything
[12:58:19] <robertmaxrees> that somebody just willy-nilly said "use ems" without there seemingly being an agreement is a little silly.
[12:58:34] <robertmaxrees> but it's silly partially because there's no standard soooo
[12:59:11] <MikeD_> i miss the conventions that we had in mast job, they weren't perfect but they were something
[12:59:27] <MikeD_> here we have free-for-all and it's not as great as one might imagine
[13:00:02] <MikeD_> i like chatting with you (haven't done so in a while)
[13:00:29] <robertmaxrees> why not be the person that starts getting those conventions documented and handled?
[13:00:59] <MikeD_> good question
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:01:21] <robertmaxrees> stuff like that is what helps you level up
[13:01:33] <robertmaxrees> for both you and the team
[13:51:06] <kiwi_7959> hi
[13:51:40] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[13:52:04] <kiwi_7959> general question, i have a page a with 1 button called plot. and i have a page b with a d3.js plot to be plotted (with data beeing passed). can i open page b in a popup window when page a plot it pressed?
[13:52:21] <robertmaxrees> yep
[13:52:28] <kiwi_7959> how to do that?
[13:52:41] <kiwi_7959> and how to pass data from page a to page b?
[13:52:52] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open
[13:52:54] <kiwi_7959> page a receives data from the server
[13:53:04] <robertmaxrees> as far as "pass data" - do you mean send them between the pages?
[13:53:09] <robertmaxrees> or via the server?
[13:53:21] <kiwi_7959> page a gets the data from server
[13:53:26] <kiwi_7959> and page b needs them
[13:53:35] <kiwi_7959> to plot
[13:53:42] <robertmaxrees> that doesn'
[13:53:48] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't answer my question ;)
[13:53:49] <kiwi_7959> make sense? ^^
[13:54:03] <robertmaxrees> when you open page b, can you load that data from the server?
[13:54:19] <kiwi_7959> no
[13:54:27] <kiwi_7959> its already loaded
[13:54:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:54:33] <robertmaxrees> how?
[13:54:50] <kiwi_7959> i click the button on page a -> i send a request to the server -> get data from server -> open page b and want to plot the data
[13:55:02] <kiwi_7959> something like that
[13:55:23] <kiwi_7959> and page b is a popup window with a d3.js plot
[13:55:25] <robertmaxrees> you realize when you open the new window, you can use a URL./
[13:55:38] <robertmaxrees> as the source for that popup.
[13:55:52] <kiwi_7959> but what about the javascript?
[13:55:53] <robertmaxrees> either way, if you really think you need to do this client-side, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage is one option.
[13:56:14] <robertmaxrees> you could also use a service worker to handle this, but that may not be fully appropriate in this case.
[13:56:27] <kiwi_7959> with postMessage?
[13:56:27] <robertmaxrees> the client-side JS here might be totally irrelevant.
[13:56:49] <robertmaxrees> postMessage is one way to send data between windows, but nothing about your use case tells me you actually need it :)
[13:57:08] <kiwi_7959> why not?
[13:57:27] <robertmaxrees> the popup can load data from the server.
[13:57:28] <kiwi_7959> i need update the page a also based on what i receive from server
[13:57:33] <kiwi_7959> thats why
[13:57:43] <robertmaxrees> popups are like normal windows.
[13:57:44] <kiwi_7959> + i create the plot to show the data
[13:57:52] <kiwi_7959> in page b
[13:58:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, none of that requires you to handle that all client-side/
[13:58:11] <robertmaxrees> you can load directly from the server into page b.
[13:58:18] <kiwi_7959> you mean page a and page b sends both request to server?
[13:58:33] <robertmaxrees> they could.
[13:58:44] <kiwi_7959> but if there are lots of data? :)
[13:58:50] <robertmaxrees> how much data?
[13:58:54] <kiwi_7959> might not be efficient
[13:58:57] <robertmaxrees> also: caching is a thing.
[13:59:06] <kiwi_7959> 100k-1Mill data samples
[13:59:07] <robertmaxrees> so long as your server is properly configured, it shouldn't be a problem./
[13:59:08] <kiwi_7959> for the plot
[13:59:26] <kiwi_7959> the problem is i want to show the same data
[13:59:37] <robertmaxrees> at that point I'd consider using a service worker to handle caching and go from that route.
[13:59:38] <kiwi_7959> a new request will not return the same data back to user
[13:59:40] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[13:59:48] <kiwi_7959> so i need to add caching on server too
[13:59:50] <kiwi_7959> hm
[14:00:04] <robertmaxrees> what sort of browser support do you need?
[14:00:16] <kiwi_7959> chrome is fine
[14:00:37] <robertmaxrees> then i might consider looking into service workers to handle some of the data fetching and manipulation.
[14:00:46] <robertmaxrees> especialyl with that much data in play.
[14:04:09] <kiwi_7959> i try to read about Window.postMessage()
[14:10:05] <kiwi_7959> can i do window.open as a popup window as well?
[14:10:14] <kiwi_7959> like window in front
[14:10:26] <kiwi_7959> otherwize a new tab is opened
[14:11:15] <robertmaxrees> check out https://javascript.info/popup-windows
[14:11:39] <kiwi_7959> ok look like
[14:13:06] <kiwi_7959> so i need that windowObjectReference ?
[14:13:56] <robertmaxrees> heh - i'd suggest heading over to ##javascript at this point.
[14:14:02] <kiwi_7959> lol ok
[14:14:05] <robertmaxrees> since none of this involves jquery ;)
[14:14:11] <kiwi_7959> ok haha
[14:14:58] <kiwi_7959> also the receive message for postMessage is js?
[14:15:06] <robertmaxrees> all of this is native JS.
[21:28:10] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/VI4FS
[21:28:14] <primitivMedia> why doesnt my ajax return anything on error
[21:29:52] <primitivMedia> nvm fixed itr
[23:16:48] <kiwi_7911> hi
[23:17:00] <kiwi_7911> how can i read back a json response after $.post( ... ) ?
[23:17:37] <kiwi_7911> $.post( .success = function (data) { console.log(data); ) ... that prints a text string
[23:30:39] <kiwi_7911> robertmaxrees ?
[23:46:31] <kiwi_7911> someone here? :)
[23:52:06] <shoky> kiwi_7911: $.post(..., 'json')   to parse json disregarding the response content-type
[23:53:57] <kiwi_7911> the content type from server is: Content-Type: application/json
[23:55:07] <kiwi_7911> shoky you mean like that? https://ideone.com/6jlCgt
[23:56:13] <kiwi_7911> it seems not to work... dont get a response now
[23:56:15] <kiwi_7911> hm strange
[23:57:44] <shoky> kiwi_7911: if that's the content-type then jquery should parse the json automatically already
[23:58:10] <shoky> why are you doing assignments inside the $.post call ..?
[23:58:13] <shoky> url = ...
[23:58:16] <shoky> data = ...
[23:58:40] <shoky> that's totally wrong. unless this isn't pure js ?
[23:59:20] <kiwi_7911> how to fix it?
