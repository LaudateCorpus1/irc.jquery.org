[00:32:07] <Al_nz1> what I am doing wrong but here  : https://hastebin.com/zipisofeja.js
[02:12:32] <Cork> sopparus: make it a json request and it would be invalid for it to do so
[02:12:42] <sopparus> i solved it
[02:12:50] <Cork> sopparus: basically you can't parse invalid json so...
[02:12:50] <sopparus> with array merge in php
[02:12:55] <sopparus> yeah
[02:13:00] <Cork> sopparus: also if you can fix the php
[02:13:11] <Cork> make it set Content-Type: application/json
[02:13:18] <Cork> and you won't need JSON.parse in the code
[02:13:23] <sopparus> I see
[02:13:24] <Cork> (html will be json instead)
[02:13:33] <sopparus> thanks for tip
[02:13:45] <Cork> currently you need JSON.parse cause the server sends json but tells the client it is text/html
[02:14:00] <Cork> (meaning the server lies)
[02:22:39] <dimi1947> I am having problem with jquery validate...it produces an error which is rather peculiar...I have prepared a fiddle just to show off the code...I do not replicate the error just doing some code explanation
[02:23:01] <dimi1947> some help is needed...
[02:39:53] <dimi1947> when it comes to jquery validate can you tell me code like this https://hastebin.com/kizacugiqe.js where it might be helpfull?I cannnot remember why I wrote it...
[02:44:35] <Cork> dimi1947: as far as i can tell it looks like .element only accepts selectors
[02:45:42] <Cork> i at least can't find anyone using it on dom elements (and the documentation is vague)
[03:02:54] <dimi1947> then what might be it's usefulness?
[03:03:14] <dimi1947> I cannot reach a conclusion  from what you say
[03:10:49] <Cork> dimi1947: it takes a selector not an element
[03:11:03] <Cork> element('#id-of-the-element')
[03:12:04] <dimi1947> Cork:still cannot understand what is the purpose of all of this code...not only the part you are highlighting
[03:12:21] <Cork> not sure what you're asking about
[03:12:24] <Cork> what all this code?
[03:17:44] <localh0st> dimi1947: are you basiaclly asking 'what this does'?
[03:18:05] <dimi1947> local0st:YES!!!
[03:18:44] <localh0st> OK, I guess on input's keyup event it's validating the input you've just modified
[03:18:57] <Cork> dimi1947: it grabs the validator object from the form and then runs validation on a single field in the form
[03:19:26] <localh0st> so it's not validating whole form like it would on .validate(), but it's validating only single, changed input() on typing
[03:19:40] <localh0st> ** changed <input>
[03:19:56] <dimi1947> localh0st:when you say "modified" I suppose you mean "start typing"
[03:20:10] <dimi1947> localh0st:???
[03:20:54] <localh0st> dimi1947: no, it's "keyup", just check in documentation when this event is triggered...
[03:21:58] <localh0st> ...keyup is triggered on keyboard's key release
[03:22:03] <dimi1947> localh0st:ok...that is clear...the thing is that I am getting an unexpected behavior(error) originating from this code
[03:22:32] <localh0st> dimi1947: what kind of error?
[03:22:43] <localh0st> ohh, I love those details
[03:24:30] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/n8umhqqd/   JS pane,line 53 (error start)  error message:Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeName' of null
[03:25:02] <dimi1947> let me explain what is the weird thing about this error...
[03:25:38] <dimi1947> first of all it appears when typing(that's something to be expected of course)
[03:26:24] <dimi1947> I am talking about the input element in the Services fieldset:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/n8umhqqd/
[03:26:50] <dimi1947> and now the weird part...
[03:26:51] <localh0st> dimi1947: first of all, fix your html
[03:26:52] <localh0st>       </form>
[03:26:53] <localh0st>           </fieldset>
[03:26:58] <localh0st>  <form  id="formall" action="" method="post">
[03:26:58] <localh0st>        
[03:26:58] <localh0st>     
[03:26:59] <localh0st>              <fieldset class="openpersonal">
[03:27:21] <localh0st> you have the tags not properly closed, fix it, it may fix your problem
[03:28:46] <dimi1947> localh0st:I cannot find where the tags are not properly closed...
[03:29:10] <dimi1947> to which lines in the HTML pane are you referring to?
[03:30:12] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/n8umhqqd/
[03:30:18] <dimi1947> is it now OK?
[03:31:29] <dimi1947> by the way ignore for now...the HTML in the fiddle
[03:32:25] <dimi1947> I want to speak about the weird part now...are you following me?
[03:37:05] <localh0st> dimi1947: HTML is not valid at all
[03:37:07] <localh0st>     <h2>Delete Account</>
[03:37:11] <localh0st> what is this?
[03:37:17] <localh0st> this is just example
[03:37:44] <localh0st> jsfiddle is highlight invalid elements in red
[03:38:06] <localh0st> jquery's validate() method won't work properly if even your HTML is invalid
[03:39:05] <localh0st> + using validate() method will not validate your inputs like:
[03:39:06] <localh0st>   <input type="text"  class="text" data-originalvalue="" name="email" id="" size="40" value="">
[03:40:24] <localh0st> because it will not validate this input for email but for text, so I can't see any sense in validating those fields
[04:25:32] <jorgesumle> Hi, I'm using <template> HTML elements to copy and paste HTML in my program.
[04:26:00] <jorgesumle> The problem is that when I copy and paste an element the id attribute repeats, which is incorrect
[04:26:28] <Cork> jorgesumle: i would say don't use ids
[04:26:36] <Cork> use classes and element position
[04:27:22] <Cork> you normally don't need ids for elements and classes lets you have multiple with the same name
[04:27:33] <jorgesumle> That's obviously true. Maybe I'm just idiot.
[04:27:59] <Cork> no, your not, it is quite common to overuse ids
[04:28:31] <Cork> if you prefer you can take the template and loop over and increment add a number after all ids
[04:28:39] <Cork> but i find the class solution much cleaner
[04:38:11] <dimi1947> localh0st:I am going to correct the HTML issues but I believe the error I get is totally irrelevant to it
[04:43:27] <localh0st> dimi1947: yeah, sure
[04:43:55] <dimi1947> localh0st:is that an irony?
[05:29:29] <DarsVaeda> hi, how can I style the jquery ui datepicker? I need want to make it responsive. problem is that the script adds a style tag. I found some solutions like using timeout and then set the style but they feel a bit "meh"
[05:30:21] <Al_nz1> Ok, i answered my own question : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44915203/thymeleaf-ajax-mapping-json-data/44944968#44944968
[05:30:31] <Al_nz1> please upvote if you like answer
[05:32:21] <Cork> DarsVaeda: the only style information it sets should be the position: absolute and top,left to make it relative to the input field
[05:32:38] <Cork> DarsVaeda: the rest should be controlled by the stylesheet
[05:33:06] <Cork> style="position: absolute; top: 37px; left: 50.6875px; z-index: 1; display: block;" <-- is the only inline style i have
[05:33:21] <Cork> (on .ui-datepicker-div)
[05:34:56] <Cork> DarsVaeda: also and that is only if you don't make the widget inline, if you do it only has style="display: block;"
[05:45:19] <DarsVaeda> yeah that is my problem, I wanted to set it to "display: fixed"
[05:49:12] <Cork> DarsVaeda: so set display: fixed !important; in the media query
[05:49:45] <DarsVaeda> yes but it will be always display
[05:49:59] <Cork> what do you mean?
[05:50:36] <DarsVaeda> the overlay
[05:50:55] <Cork> ah, you mean you want to detect when it isn't shown
[05:53:47] <Cork> use the beforeShow and onClose events and add a class to the widget element
[05:53:48] <DarsVaeda> wait I'll try it again, I remember I set it to fixed!important yesterday and it was always displayed then because the script uses the script tag to change visibility
[05:53:55] <Cork> should solve that problem
[05:54:29] <Cork> not script tag, but script attribute
[05:54:32] <Cork> not the same thing :)
[06:03:05] <DarsVaeda> seems this won't work, which brings me back to the timeout fix: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11534635/928666
[06:03:14] <Cork> DarsVaeda: https://jsfiddle.net/0n6v7kv3/
[06:03:16] <Cork> sure it does :)
[06:03:16] <DarsVaeda> maybe I should just try that
[06:04:16] <DarsVaeda> ah I tried to set the css directly
[06:04:42] <Cork> DarsVaeda: if you want responsive that is the last thing you want :)
[06:05:32] <Cork> cause if you now wrap the css rule in a @media width < 1000px {} or something like that you have the responsive design
[06:06:21] <Cork> (the ,0 on line 7 is important, else removeClass won't respect the animation from datepicker if you use one)
[06:07:42] <DarsVaeda> hmm
[06:08:00] <DarsVaeda> in my implementatin it still prefers the position absolute of the style attribute
[06:08:44] <Cork> firstly make sure the expanded class is actually added to the widget element (#ui-datepicker-div)
[06:09:03] <Cork> and if it is, make sure the css matches as it should
[06:09:16] <DarsVaeda> yes it is and the style is applied to chrome dev console
[06:09:31] <Cork> and not crossed over?
[06:09:36] <DarsVaeda> but the console hints that the style is overwritten by the style attribute
[06:09:40] <Cork> (the display: fixed line)
[06:09:50] <Cork> not if you set !important
[06:10:15] <Cork> display: fixed !important; will win over inline styles
[06:10:35] <DarsVaeda> the page is Magento 2 they do a lot of hoopla with the datepicker, I suspect it might be something in their code
[06:11:01] <Cork> if it is you would find it in the css inspector
[06:11:10] <Cork> cause inline can't win over !important
[06:11:22] <Cork> another !important in a previous css rule can though
[06:13:14] <DarsVaeda> http://www.directupload.net/file/d/4774/hmb2nat8_png.htm
[06:13:24] <DarsVaeda> sorry for the shitty upload service
[06:14:23] <Cork> ummm, wtf
[06:14:30] <Cork> as far as i know that isn't possible...
[06:15:03] <DarsVaeda> that's what I thought too :O
[06:15:45] <Cork> hmm
[06:16:04] <DarsVaeda> but people seem to experience the same
[06:16:05] <Cork> it could be the display: block; inline has !important
[06:16:19] <Cork> cause that is the only thing i can think of
[06:16:27] <Cork> DarsVaeda: i would love it if you could reproduce it in a jsfiddle
[06:16:33] <Cork> or anything running i can look at
[06:17:42] <DarsVaeda> at least not due to the console but that might be wrong
[06:17:58] <Cork> cause this kinda contradicts how css works in my head...
[06:18:02] <DarsVaeda> unfortunately it won't be possible to reproduce the magento mess in fiddle :/
[06:18:11] <Cork> and i would prefer if that kept being true :)
[06:18:19] <DarsVaeda> hehe understandable
[06:18:41] <DarsVaeda> but as soon as you think you saw everything...
[06:18:44] <Cork> but check the style attribute in the html view
[06:18:59] <Cork> and see if it contains the same thing you see in the element.style section in the inspector
[06:19:08] <Cork> that is basically all i got :/
[06:20:24] <DarsVaeda> what's interesting is that the computed shows only the absolute in position
[06:20:46] <DarsVaeda> maybe they delete position all together and reset it then?
[06:20:48] <Cork> ya, that is normal as it wins in the element.style
[06:20:57] <Cork> the question is, why
[06:21:04] <Cork> uh.. wait, WAIT.. >_<'
[06:21:18] <Cork> its position: fixed, not display -_-'
[06:21:32] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/0n6v7kv3/1/
[06:21:35] <DarsVaeda> gnaaaaa
[06:21:36] <DarsVaeda> lol
[06:22:18] <Cork> sigh, ok css saved +1, cork -3 -_-'
[06:22:38] <DarsVaeda> I looked at this for some time as well and didn't see it -.-
[06:23:35] <DarsVaeda> now next question, why didn't that css lint thing in my ide didn't complain at least
[06:23:43] <Cork> DarsVaeda: and... that means we don't need to complicate it: https://jsfiddle.net/0n6v7kv3/2/
[06:24:19] <Cork> DarsVaeda: it prob only validates syntax and property keys
[06:24:23] <Cork> to be future safe
[06:24:42] <Cork> and display: is a valid property and the syntax is correct so...
[06:25:20] <DarsVaeda> it must have crashed, I rebooted and now it complains about it -.-
[06:28:52] <DarsVaeda> okay confirming it works now
[06:29:10] <DarsVaeda> thanks, I would probably have stared at that for some additional hours
[06:29:11] <DarsVaeda> :)
[06:29:13] <Cork> did you remove all the unneeded code too? :)
[06:29:33] <Cork> as this can be completely done in css >_>
[06:29:43] <Cork> and np
[06:31:49] <DarsVaeda> yeah I just use css now :)
[08:23:41] <afidegnum> i m facing $ is not a function error, how do i rewrite this code ? https://ghostbin.com/paste/up5zw
[08:24:11] <Uhkis> afidegnum: did you include jquery before that?
[08:24:40] <afidegnum> yes
[08:24:49] <afidegnum> before or after this code ?
[08:28:06] <Uhkis> it needs to be before
[08:31:45] <Cork> might also be its is included as noConflict
[08:32:17] <Cork> jQuery(function($) {}) instead of $(document).ready(function() {}) would solve it if that is the case
[08:33:29] <Cork> (the reason i recommend $(function() {}) instead of $(document).ready(function() {}) is cause jquery 3 is dropping the later)
[08:36:33] <jorgesumle> I found what it may be a jQuery bug: https://paste.debian.net/975099/
[08:36:42] <jorgesumle> Is this behaviour intentional?
[08:37:02] <Cork> not intentional, but a known limitation
[08:37:22] <Cork> when ready executes at line 49 the dom events it requires has already fired so it can't catch them
[08:37:40] <Cork> you should never use ready inside body
[08:38:24] <Cork> and if you put jqeury inside body a hole slue of other features beak
[08:38:27] <Cork> *break
[08:38:40] <jorgesumle> When I move the code inside the body, the same problem appears
[08:39:14] <Cork> you mean you get the same error if you have it all in head and nothing in body?
[08:41:09] <jorgesumle> No I mean: https://paste.debian.net/975101/
[08:41:23] <Cork> read the comments i just gave you
[08:41:37] <jorgesumle> With the template element, I can't modify the HTML value, but with the div it works
[08:42:02] <Cork> ya, cause templates contain text, not elements
[08:42:13] <Cork> that is the hole point of <template>
[08:42:45] <Cork> <template> is a semantic representation of <script type="text/template"></script>
[08:42:58] <Cork> so what you have inside is not part of the dom, it is just a string of text
[08:43:04] <jorgesumle> https://www.w3.org/TR/html/semantics-scripting.html#the-template-element
[08:43:21] <jorgesumle> The template element is used to declare fragments of HTML that can be cloned and inserted in the document by script.
[08:43:31] <jorgesumle> It says "fragments of HTML"
[08:43:32] <Cork> ya, of html
[08:43:37] <Cork> not fragment of dom
[08:43:55] <Cork> what is inside you later grab as html and parse into dom
[08:44:01] <Cork> aka text
[08:45:04] <Cork> the point of <template> is to be able to keep template html around without having to slow down the dom by having a lot of dom elements in it for future template use
[08:45:17] <Cork> or to have to keep said html in javascript strings
[08:46:18] <Cork> when you use the template api, it parses the html into dom and gives you a reference to the new elements
[08:47:01] <jorgesumle> So, what should I use to store templates I want to be able to modify with jQuery?
[08:47:07] <jorgesumle> Hidden divs?
[08:47:21] <jorgesumle> Is there any convention for that?
[08:47:27] <Cork> well why you would want to modify a template before you use it is beyond me
[08:47:36] <Cork> just modify it when you create an instance of the template
[08:48:11] <Cork> or ya, sure use a <div style="display: none"></div> and clone the content instead of importNode
[08:48:20] <jorgesumle> I want to change the id of a element of that template.
[08:48:27] <Cork> why?
[08:48:32] <jorgesumle> I was going to use <div hidden></div>
[08:48:43] <Cork> again it is something the template user should do
[08:49:07] <jorgesumle> Because I want to use that template multiple times, and ids should be unique. Also the name for a form control
[08:49:24] <Cork> so you mean for every time you use it you should modify the content of the template?
[08:49:28] <jorgesumle> You can't have to <input name="sample">
[08:49:30] <Cork> instead of having a base template
[08:49:46] <Cork> and then append a number you have in var idIncrement = 0;
[08:49:58] <Cork> and just <find id> = idIncrement++;
[08:50:12] <Cork> the former sounds like a lot more wasteful to me
[08:56:49] <Cork> fortysixandtwo: this is what i talk about: https://jsfiddle.net/c92t6cap/
[08:57:33] <Cork> opps wrong nick...
[08:57:35] <fortysixandtwo> Wrong name :P
[08:57:38] <Cork> jorgesumle: ^
[08:57:40] <Cork> ya, sorry
[08:57:44] <fortysixandtwo> np!
[10:22:25] <shakaponk> hey guys, $('.ui').on('ui:update', function(event) {…} works fine, while $('.ui').on('ui:update', '#panel-images', function(event) {…} does nothing, although #panel-images is a child of .ui. what am i missing?
[10:23:13] <Cork> shakaponk: what is the event.target in the former?
[10:23:44] <shakaponk> @Cork: sorry, i don’t understand. what do you mean?
[10:23:49] <Cork> meaning are you sure it is emanating from #panel-images?
[10:24:10] <Cork> never heard of a ui:update event though
[10:24:36] <shakaponk> @Cork its a custom event
[10:24:50] <Cork> you mean you create it your self?
[10:25:05] <Cork> what i meant is i have never heard of a lib creating it
[10:25:10] <shakaponk> i would like to send some custom event. and only some components will update itself
[10:25:38] <Cork> could you make a jsfiddle.net with the code triggering the event and the two listeners?
[10:25:55] <shakaponk> according to https://learn.jquery.com/events/introduction-to-custom-events/ should be easy
[10:26:21] <Cork> sure it is
[10:26:22] <shakaponk> @Cork hold on, could take a while :-)
[10:26:35] <Cork> i use it from time to time too, though i normally prefer callbacks
[10:27:12] <ozette> can i squeeze in headers in a $.get() request? or must i use $.ajax per se?
[10:27:26] <Cork> you need to use $.ajax
[10:27:32] <ozette> damn
[10:27:41] <Cork> though the difference is only one character so why the problem?
[10:27:53] <ozette> the whole codebase is full of $.get
[10:27:54] <Cork> $.get(url) => $.ajax(url)
[10:28:09] <Cork> s/$.get/$.ajax/g
[10:28:11] <Cork> done :)
[10:28:59] <Cork> ozette: if you want to add the header to all request you can look at useing $.ajaxSetup
[10:29:16] <ozette> i've seen $.ajaxSetup yes
[10:29:21] <ozette> but i only need it at a specific request
[10:29:28] <Cork> ya, then you want $.ajax
[10:29:31] <ozette> i'll see what i can do, thanks @Cork
[10:30:16] <Cork> ozette: i normally never bother with $.post and $.get as $.ajax can do the same thing with extreamly littel extra characters
[10:30:45] <Cork> $.post(url, data) => $.ajax(url, { type: 'post', data: data })
[10:31:36] <ozette> you're right, not sure why $.get was used
[10:39:07] <shakaponk> @Cork: got it https://jsfiddle.net/g0jf7ryw/1/
[10:39:40] <shakaponk> what i expect is, that every “component” get its own bg-color
[10:40:02] <Cork> shakaponk: that isn't how delegation works
[10:40:04] <shakaponk> it works without .componentX selector. but for all
[10:40:18] <Cork> shakaponk: https://jsfiddle.net/g0jf7ryw/2/
[10:40:58] <Cork> shakaponk: what are you trying to do?
[10:41:00] <shakaponk> @Cork: yes, thats obvious
[10:41:13] <Cork> shakaponk: what do you mean?
[10:41:32] <Cork> you can't delegate events for component1 to ui and then trigger it in ui
[10:41:40] <Cork> as the event won't be on component1
[10:42:00] <shakaponk> i want to post an event for all .ui elements but every element depending on granulation “component1” has their own handler
[10:42:19] <Cork> shakaponk: you can't really do that
[10:42:34] <shakaponk> i could do something if $this.hasClass(component1)…
[10:42:37] <Cork> you can do this though https://jsfiddle.net/g0jf7ryw/3/
[10:43:37] <shakaponk> @Cork: well thats exactly i would expect from my first attempt :-) why does this work?
[10:44:07] <Cork> shakaponk: cause it selects all .component elements and trigger the "ui:update" event on them
[10:44:19] <Cork> so component1 and component2 gets an event
[10:44:41] <Cork> i would recommend thinking about something like this though https://jsfiddle.net/g0jf7ryw/4/
[10:44:57] <Cork> let the element keep information on what should happen for it, and have one event handler for them all
[10:45:34] <Cork> in the long run that tends to give you code that is much easier to maintain
[10:45:40] <Cork> as it lets you write once and use many
[10:47:01] <shakaponk> ok, i’ll check it out. could you please tell me, $(‘.table tr’) creates X event handler for each tr, but $(‘.table’, ‘tr’) creates one on .table and filters on tr, why didn’t it work in my case?
[10:47:15] <Cork> you can also do something like this https://jsfiddle.net/g0jf7ryw/5/
[10:47:21] <Cork> ( i use this structure a lot)
[10:47:40] <Cork> shakaponk: no
[10:47:46] <Cork> the second one is invalid
[10:48:12] <Cork> you can do something like $('tr', $('.table')) but that is identical to $('.table tr')
[10:48:48] <Cork> $('tr', $('.table')) is a short for $('.table').find('tr')
[10:49:02] <shakaponk> but thats as far as i can see the description from here http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:49:18] <Cork> that's .on() not $()
[10:50:00] <Cork> $('selector1').on('event', 'selector2') is NOT the same as $('selector2', 'selector1').on('event'
[10:50:12] <Cork> $() finds elements
[10:50:25] <Cork> that result set is then given to .on that binds the event handler
[10:50:42] <Cork> the selector given to on can then be used by on as a filter for what event it should trigger your callback for
[10:51:05] <Cork> after the initial search for elements $() isn't involved
[10:51:17] <shakaponk> ah, oh, uh…F@$#
[10:51:26] <Cork> lol
[10:52:05] <shakaponk> ok, thx. got a little bit clearer. i’ll check out your jsfiddle
[11:19:46] <stennowork> damn, it seems to me that jquery cannot handle <select multiple> with serializeArray
[11:20:23] <stennowork> actually i think its the select box plugin, n/m
[11:27:57] <stennowork> hrm i wonder
[11:30:35] <bomb> tsk tsk
[11:35:37] <stennowork> yeah serializeArray can't handle <select multiple>
[11:36:01] <stennowork> hrm or does it
[11:36:02] <stennowork> wtf
[11:36:06] * stennowork does some more research
[11:42:49] <stennowork> yeah it can't
[11:49:31] <Uhkis> yes it does
[11:51:39] <Uhkis> https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/ it's even in the demo
[12:23:29] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning #jquery
[12:43:02] <taplar> yo
[12:43:32] <robertmaxrees> how goes?
[12:44:34] <taplar> so so, nother day in paradise
[13:15:26] <JrWebDev> how can i determine if a element is toggled
[13:15:37] <robertmaxrees> "toggled" as in...?
[13:16:55] <JrWebDev> if $('.thisClass').toggle() is true then $('.thisClass').hide()  or how can i have an ajax post request respect if a class is toggled or not
[13:17:19] <JrWebDev> when i do a ajax post request..it doesnt look if thisClass is toggled or not..it doesnt care for it
[13:18:00] <robertmaxrees> I'd rethink that strategy and use explicit addClass/removeClass
[13:18:01] <JrWebDev> how can i make ajax post respect and listen if $('.thisClass').toggle();
[13:18:05] <robertmaxrees> then jkust test the element for the class.
[13:47:38] <JrWebDev> this should be very very very simple....how do you get ajax post requests to respect the rest of the codes inside <script> tags???? should be extremely simple.
[13:48:57] <JrWebDev> if i have $('thisClass').hide() in my <script> tag at the bottom of my body...how do i get an ajax request to respect and look at that???
[13:49:38] <JrWebDev> been stuck on this for 3 straight days
[13:49:45] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "respect and look at that"?
[13:49:50] <JrWebDev> oh man
[13:49:52] <robertmaxrees> show some code so we have some context :)
[13:50:11] <JrWebDev> okay
[13:50:47] <JrWebDev> i mean i dont know how much simplier i can make it
[13:51:13] <robertmaxrees> seeing the code will help.
[13:55:28] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev also: the question of ".how do you get ajax post requests to respect the rest
[13:55:28] <robertmaxrees> of the codes inside <script> tags????
[13:55:45] <robertmaxrees> that's ephemeral.  What do you mean by "respect the rest of the codes"?
[13:55:58] <robertmaxrees> do you mean re-run some particular code?
[13:58:02] <JrWebDev> yes rerun the code..ill give you an example code right now
[13:58:42] <robertmaxrees> so that's now how JS works.  ajax calls don't magically re-run any JS - gotta do that part manually yourself.
[14:00:01] <JrWebDev> here we go
[14:00:02] <JrWebDev> https://jsfiddle.net/4wLydg8j/
[14:00:08] <JrWebDev> should explain it a bit
[14:00:48] <robertmaxrees> so what here isn't workin?
[14:01:23] <JrWebDev> i forgot to say that $.post is inside a click event
[14:01:29] <JrWebDev> well
[14:01:43] <JrWebDev> when i click...it will empty and append but it wont hide()
[14:02:10] <robertmaxrees> do you always want that to default to hiodden?
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> *hidden
[14:02:51] <JrWebDev> no...i have a button that i want to use to .toggle() or hide and unhide when clicked
[14:03:00] <robertmaxrees> so what's broken then?
[14:03:04] <robertmaxrees> is the click handler not workign any more?
[14:03:12] <robertmaxrees> after you replace that content, i mean.
[14:03:14] <JrWebDev> let me change the code
[14:03:46] <taplar> or is the new element with the class 'hideMyASS' visible again
[14:03:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:04:33] <robertmaxrees> sounds like he's got a click event bound to something that gets replaced.
[14:05:46] <taplar> i'm wondering if the state of that thing is 'resetting' and he'd be better with a css rule making it hidden by default and let the toggle show it
[14:06:08] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's where i was headed with that question about defaulting to hidden
[14:07:43] <JrWebDev> hopefully this clarifies it some
[14:07:44] <JrWebDev> https://jsfiddle.net/4wLydg8j/1/
[14:08:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/4wLydg8j/3/ fwiw.
[14:08:55] <JrWebDev> so now when i click...<div class="hideMyA**"> still shows...when i click it will toggle.. show or hide that div
[14:08:58] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, you want to default .hideMyASS to hidden and you have a click event bound to somethign that gets replaced.
[14:10:28] <robertmaxrees> so what you have is kind of like this: https://jsfiddle.net/4wLydg8j/4/
[14:10:55] <robertmaxrees> so my first question is why you don't just display: none; on that hide class.
[14:11:24] <robertmaxrees> and the second issue is that .hide_and_show_button gets replaced, so that click handler breaks.  that's an easy fix, though - just use a delegated handler.
[14:11:58] <robertmaxrees> though you also have a click handler on the parent .replaceMe element, which might be causing some headaches.
[14:12:30] <JrWebDev> using display: none in css?
[14:12:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/4wLydg8j/6/
[14:12:39] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:12:43] <robertmaxrees> hides that element by default.
[14:12:46] <robertmaxrees> no extra JS needed.
[14:12:56] <robertmaxrees> next up: what's with the nested click handlers?
[14:13:05] <JrWebDev> display none leaves whitespace if i remember correctly
[14:13:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:13:19] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of visibility: hidden;
[14:13:26] <JrWebDev> mm
[14:13:33] <robertmaxrees> display: none; removes it completely from the page, as my fiddle shows.
[14:13:43] <robertmaxrees> well, not completely - it takes it out of flow.
[14:14:07] <JrWebDev> let me see
[14:16:37] <JrWebDev> darn ur right robertmaxrees display: none leaves no whitespace
[14:16:48] <JrWebDev> that would've saved me so much headache too
[14:16:50] <JrWebDev> but
[14:17:29] <JrWebDev> which nested click handlers
[14:17:46] <robertmaxrees> $('.hide_and_show_button') targets an element that's a child of $('.replaceMe')
[14:17:54] <robertmaxrees> they both have click handlers bound to them.
[14:18:04] <JrWebDev> well yeah theres more going on there
[14:18:09] <JrWebDev> believe me i dont wanna code the whole thing
[14:18:15] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:18:18] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[14:18:19] <JrWebDev> its a chat/messaging system
[14:18:26] <JrWebDev> and theres more logic in the code
[14:18:30] <robertmaxrees> so are they nested like that?
[14:18:59] <robertmaxrees> in the "real" version.
[14:19:14] <JrWebDev> yes my js succckks i guess but yes
[14:19:26] <robertmaxrees> okay, so there are a few things you need to do.
[14:19:46] <robertmaxrees> first of all, because .hide_and_show_button gets replaced, the binding breaks.  so you need to use a delegated handler for that instead.
[14:20:11] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ explain what's going on and shows you how to fix it.
[14:20:13] <JrWebDev> hhmm okay
[14:20:40] <robertmaxrees> you also need to e.stopPropagation(); in the handler for .hide_and_show_button
[14:22:25] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:22:38] <JrWebDev> ok
[14:50:58] <Robin___> Hello! Why wont this simple script work? Thanks: https://pastebin.com/BVGbUjZp (sorry for using pastebin)
[14:51:55] <robertmaxrees> because the script runs before the element exists.
[14:52:11] <robertmaxrees> but also: you don't need jquery for that.
[14:52:52] <Robin___> ahhh ofcourse. i just moved script to bottom of body
[14:52:53] <Robin___> thanks
[14:53:04] <robertmaxrees> you can also use a document ready instead.
[14:53:20] <Robin___> how? :)
[14:54:06] <Robin___> got it
[14:54:07] <Robin___> thx
[14:58:24] <taplar> did you get the comment that you don't need js for that?
[14:59:09] <Robin___> yep :)
[15:47:52] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day
[15:48:38] <Al_nz1> why dat?
[15:49:28] <robertmaxrees> just a lot going on.  plus I have a gig right after work so I gotta ditch early to grab my gear and drive to the next town over.
[15:50:10] <Al_nz1> what inst?
[15:51:43] <robertmaxrees> for this particular project I sing and play guitar.
[15:51:50] <Al_nz1> cool bro
[15:55:47] <spinningCat> is there an particular event for that situtation? You are in a screen and there is an object such as box when you move your mouse left or right, up or down the object percieve this move and go certain direction?
[15:56:38] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah there's the mousemove event.
[15:56:43] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[15:56:57] <hellyeah> game
[15:57:03] <hellyeah> simple game
[15:57:45] <hellyeah> there will be a map and objects. When those object moves around. Some circles will be drawned.
[15:57:50] <hellyeah> This is the first step
[15:58:13] <hellyeah> let me check mousemove
[15:58:32] <hellyeah> i will have new job finally
[15:59:14] <robertmaxrees> niiiiiice
[15:59:21] <robertmaxrees> grats
[15:59:34] <hellyeah> thanks i am waiting news from HR next week
[15:59:42] <hellyeah> that is really close to my house
[15:59:59] <hellyeah> my commute was like 3:30 hours not it is just 45 mins probably
[16:00:17] <hellyeah> and i will spare time to freelance things
[16:00:31] <hellyeah> this little game is freelance's work
[16:02:36] <hellyeah> anyway i saw ;(function(){  }, +(function(){}
[16:02:45] <hellyeah> what is the difference of these usage?
[16:03:10] <robertmaxrees> the first one seems incomplete.  was there a )() or ()) after it?
[16:04:48] <Al_nz1> why is this fiddle not going? https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34573/
[16:04:55] <hellyeah> honestly i dont reemember but i am certain i saw +,; instead of $
[16:05:00] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah also: that second one was probably +function() { console.log("Foo!"); }();
[16:05:04] <robertmaxrees> right?
[16:05:41] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 valid html is helpful.
[16:06:01] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 i'm not seeing closeing taks for some of those elements.
[16:06:13] <JrWebDev> $('.table tr').find('img').css('visibility', 'visible'); how do i find with <tr data-value=myVar>
[16:06:39] <hellyeah> object didnt follow the mose https://jsfiddle.net/rk4gjzv9/
[16:06:43] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev "with"?
[16:06:53] <JrWebDev> yeah
[16:06:55] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev you mean the tr that has that data attribute?
[16:06:59] <JrWebDev> yes
[16:07:17] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you have to do the rest yourself.
[16:07:20] <hellyeah> .data()
[16:07:24] <robertmaxrees> i just told you the event.
[16:07:25] <cannap> "[data-value=myValue]"
[16:07:31] <Al_nz1> what about now : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34576/
[16:07:35] <robertmaxrees> or .filter() with a function
[16:07:53] <robertmaxrees> i tend to favor avoiding attribute selectors, especially with data attributes.
[16:07:57] <hellyeah> hmm event is not enough i got it
[16:08:12] <JrWebDev> cannap, .find("[data-value=" + myVar + "] img") ?
[16:08:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:09:02] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 how did you troublershoot it?
[16:09:04] <hellyeah> JrWebDev:  you should fiddle what you did so far
[16:10:09] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I did look to breakpoint the JS - but cant see how to do that with a fiddle
[16:10:19] <cannap> something like that but  .find('[data-value=" + myVar + "] img')
[16:10:21] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 there's also console.log
[16:10:34] <hellyeah> .data("data-value", "myVar") may be
[16:10:39] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:10:44] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:10:44] <robertmaxrees> never data- when using .data()
[16:10:46] <cannap> something like that but  .find('[data-value="' + myVar + '"] img')
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> or $('tr').filter(function() { return $(this).data('value') === myVar });
[16:11:16] <robertmaxrees> imo.
[16:11:19] <cannap> i dont know i use template strings for this ugly "''''""" mix
[16:11:34] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: console says issue with get, but I dont think that should be a problem since I am defining result
[16:11:42] <hellyeah> my mistake
[16:12:02] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: no other error on console when I click get
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> cannap hence my suggestion to use .filter() ;)
[16:12:16] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 that get will always fail on jsfiddle because that URL doesn't exist.
[16:12:19] <hellyeah> hmm i got it
[16:12:30] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34577/ so instead you just don't use it here.
[16:12:34] <robertmaxrees> since you're defining result anyway
[16:12:39] <hellyeah> i have to get x and y position of mouse move and trey to change position of object dynamically
[16:12:39] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes I get that
[16:13:40] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34579/
[16:13:44] <robertmaxrees> there's your issue.
[16:14:00] <JrWebDev>  $('.table tr').find('[data-value="' + 2 + '"] img').css('visibility', 'visible'); doesnt work
[16:14:22] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev use my filter suggestion.
[16:14:24] <robertmaxrees> it'll work.
[16:14:24] <JrWebDev> javascript sure is a challenging language to master
[16:14:32] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[16:14:41] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating what .find() does in that context.
[16:14:45] <cannap> mae jsfiddle example
[16:14:48] <hellyeah> javascript is written in 10 days afaik
[16:15:00] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah just the first version.
[16:15:07] <robertmaxrees> it's been subsequently updated.
[16:15:30] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: when the click button is clicked console.log doesnt print anything
[16:15:41] <Al_nz1> so the line where the console.log is doesnt even get hit
[16:15:43] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 it's printing 0 for me.
[16:15:43] <JrWebDev> robert which jsfiddle are you refering to
[16:15:58] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34577/
[16:15:59] <hellyeah> sure ecmascript 6 is out i heard something about exma script 7
[16:16:04] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev i sent the line of code out in chat.
[16:16:14] <robertmaxrees> $('tr').filter(function() { return $(this).data('value') === myVar });
[16:16:25] <JrWebDev> ah ok
[16:16:28] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 right, go outside of the loop :)
[16:16:58] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34580/
[16:17:00] <Al_nz1> why move the console.log out of the loop? I want to be in the loop
[16:17:08] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 look at that last fiddle.
[16:17:12] <robertmaxrees> it'll tell you the problem.
[16:18:23] <JrWebDev> robertmaxrees, yeah that didnt work for me niether
[16:18:32] <robertmaxrees> you don't get a 0 in your console?
[16:18:39] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not filtering things out of your dev tools.
[16:18:42] <cannap> use filter
[16:18:45] <cannap> my thing needs each
[16:18:54] <cannap> i thikn
[16:18:56] <robertmaxrees> the issue is $theForm.find('.bootstrap-select') doesn't find anything.
[16:18:57] <Al_nz1> what happened to all the code formatting
[16:19:07] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 huh?
[16:19:24] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/mevtfpp0/
[16:19:26] <cannap> here
[16:19:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:19:33] <cannap> you cant find the data in tr direct
[16:19:52] <robertmaxrees> cannap if the attribute selector is hard to read, why use it?
[16:20:06] <cannap> dont know
[16:20:10] <cannap> i dont need
[16:20:12] <robertmaxrees> also: data attributes can get set/modified through means that don't touch the document, so that selector won't work.
[16:20:36] <robertmaxrees> at least in some cases.
[16:20:44] <cannap> i would add a unique id when its possible
[16:20:45] <cannap> done :P
[16:20:50] <robertmaxrees> cannap ew
[16:20:57] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 see where the issue is now?
[16:21:43] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: No i dont
[16:21:55] <robertmaxrees> $theForm.find('.bootstrap-select') doesn't exist.
[16:21:59] <Al_nz1> the issue I have is that the bootstrap selects are setup different on my machine
[16:22:09] <Al_nz1> right, so yes I see the issue.
[16:22:10] <cannap> oO
[16:22:12] <robertmaxrees> in fact, bootstrap-select doesn't exist in the fiddle.
[16:22:41] <Al_nz1> I think its this live search function I have which I need to recreate on the fiddle
[16:22:54] <robertmaxrees> is it another plugin?
[16:23:01] <Al_nz1> because the data base returns the value (US) not the name of the country
[16:23:25] <Al_nz1> so setting the value "US" on the dropdown isnt really what I want....I need to set selected
[16:23:37] <robertmaxrees> that DOES set selected though.
[16:23:45] <robertmaxrees> setting the value of a dropdown selects the corresponding value.
[16:24:08] <robertmaxrees> i spent a bunch of time showing you that yesterday.
[16:24:15] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: well this plugin is screwing with the funcitonality
[16:24:21] <robertmaxrees> what plugin?
[16:24:30] <Al_nz1> because its not working that way - lemme try to get the plugin going on fiddle
[16:24:42] <robertmaxrees> what's the name of the plugin?>
[16:25:30] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i've asked like 3 times now lol
[16:25:35] <Al_nz1> https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap-select/1.11.2/js/bootstrap-select.min.js
[16:25:58] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  seems this is the way i go https://jsfiddle.net/rk4gjzv9/2/
[16:26:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34584/
[16:26:28] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 works fine here.
[16:27:05] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes, I get that but it dont work here...I am trying to reproduce on a fiddle which is a misson in itself
[16:27:47] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: No it doesnt work. See how it sets the value to US not to the name of the country "United States"
[16:28:00] <Al_nz1> well it displays US, rather than United States
[16:28:06] <Al_nz1> the value should be US
[16:28:09] <robertmaxrees> $('.selectpicker').selectpicker('val', 'Mustard');
[16:28:12] <robertmaxrees> http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/methods/
[16:28:16] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want to uise.
[16:28:17] <robertmaxrees> *use
[16:28:42] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: but the database doesnt return US and United States.
[16:28:52] <Al_nz1> United States only exists in the client
[16:28:56] <Al_nz1> the DB stores US
[16:29:05] <robertmaxrees> does the DB toss back "US"?
[16:29:09] <Al_nz1> yes
[16:29:21] <robertmaxrees> and the client uses that value for the vcalue attr.
[16:29:27] <robertmaxrees> so that method will work.
[16:29:46] <Al_nz1> but I dont want US displayed to the user. It should be United States
[16:29:51] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:29:53] <robertmaxrees> and that's what it'll display.
[16:29:55] <robertmaxrees> united states.
[16:30:02] <robertmaxrees> just like a normal dropdown.
[16:30:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34587/
[16:30:36] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you keep arguing with me about this topic heh.
[16:30:47] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:30:56] <Al_nz1> oh I see so 'val' is parameter not a var
[16:32:38] <hellyeah> why that give me zero https://jsfiddle.net/rk4gjzv9/5/
[16:32:59] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah probably because 'this' refers to the element.
[16:33:22] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript%20mousemove%20get%20mouse%20position
[16:33:33] <hellyeah> html is not an element?
[16:34:05] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah erm, what?
[16:34:08] <robertmaxrees> you want the mouse position.
[16:34:13] <robertmaxrees> not the element position, right?
[16:34:14] <hellyeah> ye
[16:34:29] <hellyeah> well i want the position of mouse in x and y axis
[16:34:37] <hellyeah> yes thats right
[16:35:56] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 you see my fiddle that sets the value?
[16:36:07] <cannap> google
[16:36:11] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: and the find "exception" I need to handle is the date picker. I guess just use moment to get it from yyyy-mm-dd to dd/mm/yyyy ?
[16:36:20] <cannap> mousemove e console.log(e)
[16:36:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:36:23] <cannap> check the output
[16:36:29] <cannap> sry @hellyeah
[16:36:29] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 you lost me.
[16:37:01] <Al_nz1> one of the fields is a date picker. It comes back from the db in yyyy-mm-dd but the usual format for that field is dd/mm/yyyy
[16:37:55] <hellyeah> it gave the position info when i select #object https://jsfiddle.net/rk4gjzv9/6/
[16:38:13] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 not sure waht you mean.  fiddle?
[16:38:16] <cannap> you want move the div?
[16:38:28] <robertmaxrees> cannap don;'t do it for him ;)
[16:38:34] <cannap> what
[16:38:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:38:47] <cannap> hellyeah first add the eventlistener on body
[16:38:56] <cannap> and check when you are o nthe div which you want move
[16:39:01] <cannap> because you will lose the focus
[16:39:32] <hellyeah> i want to move the div thats right
[16:39:41] <hellyeah> dont give me the answer
[16:39:45] <hellyeah> thats robertmaxrees said
[16:39:50] <cannap> what
[16:39:57] <hellyeah> :D
[16:40:07] <robertmaxrees> ol
[16:40:08] <robertmaxrees> *lol
[16:40:34] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you know there are tons of google results about your question, yeah?
[16:40:36] <hellyeah> dude when you do $('#object').mousemove(function(e){ console.log(e.pageX) }
[16:40:58] <hellyeah> just give you value of pageX when mouse over that object
[16:41:37] <hellyeah> i am checking google too i got pageX, pageY, offsetLeft and offsetTop information from google :D
[16:42:30] <cannap> calculate
[16:43:03] <cannap> https://feedbackr-938df.firebaseapp.com/design
[16:43:05] <cannap> i made it here :P
[16:43:29] <taplar> lol
[16:43:53] <hellyeah> this is good
[16:44:02] <taplar> it's also a solution
[16:44:15] <cannap> not sure i deleted
[16:44:16] <taplar> which was expressly asked not to be provided
[16:44:19] <cannap> wait let me search
[16:45:00] <hellyeah> taplar:  i wont be that guy
[16:45:17] <hellyeah> anyway if i understand correcly
[16:45:21] <hellyeah> correctly
[16:45:47] <hellyeah> i have to get some position information and change the position of object dynamically each time when you move the mose over html
[16:46:13] <cannap> yes
[16:46:39] <cannap> you need to change the css from the div
[16:46:47] <cannap> you can use top left what ever or translate
[16:47:03] <cannap> translate3d is easier its gues from the point where are you
[16:47:03] <cannap> atm
[16:47:08] <hellyeah> translate?
[16:47:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:47:14] <cannap> transform: translate3d
[16:47:17] <cannap> or top left
[16:47:31] <cannap> or transform:translate
[16:48:20] <cannap> you want the source from the dot?
[16:48:26] <cannap> its for vue but the move stuff is vanilla
[16:48:43] <cannap> and yea instead of the vue binding you can say $('bla).css
[16:49:11] <Al_nz1> what is missing from this fiddle to get the date picker to render properly : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34593/
[16:49:24] <cannap> https://gist.github.com/cannap/b3fa9af8d70c5d8492634be8d0fd8a87
[16:49:57] <cannap> @Al_nz1, you missed });
[16:50:04] <cannap> and dataPicker is not a function
[16:50:06] <cannap> when i add this line
[16:51:15] * robertmaxrees opens console on Al_nz1's fiddle
[16:51:21] <Al_nz1> cannap: where ? https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34594/
[16:51:41] <cannap> now its gone
[16:51:46] <cannap> i got end of line error
[16:52:13] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 you sure that's the right plugin you're including?
[16:52:50] <Al_nz1> is there a way to check my end?
[16:53:08] <robertmaxrees> well i mean
[16:54:53] <Al_nz1> wait i think i got it
[16:55:17] <hellyeah> i have a progress https://jsfiddle.net/rk4gjzv9/12/ but that moves weirdly
[16:55:28] <hellyeah> i am sure i have miscalculation error
[16:55:35] <hellyeah> i should work on it little bitr
[16:56:35] <hellyeah> cannap:  what events did you use?
[16:56:54] <cannap> what
[16:56:57] <cannap> i only know mousemove
[16:57:12] <cannap> the others are just to handle when the mouse is down
[16:57:22] <hellyeah> ah but when you click object it came with mouse right
[16:57:43] <JrWebDev> is there any way you can say when webpage reloads do this and that
[16:57:44] <Al_nz1> buggered if I know https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34600/
[16:58:02] <hellyeah> say what?
[16:59:51] <hellyeah> anyway
[17:00:03] <Al_nz1> can you reorder the load order of libs in fiddle?
[17:04:05] <cannap> @hellyeah,
[17:04:07] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/rk4gjzv9/14/
[17:04:13] <cannap> you x <-> y
[17:05:51] <cannap> @hellyeah, https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/rk4gjzv9/15/ make the mouse in the middle of the object
[17:07:05] <hellyeah> +25?
[17:07:09] <cannap> yea
[17:07:16] <cannap> its like this top50% -margin
[17:07:26] <hellyeah> i could never think of smt like that honestly
[17:07:28] <cannap> the half of width or height
[17:07:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[17:07:56] <cannap> you had this wrong css({'top': y,'left':x});  you had css({'top': x, 'left':y);
[17:08:04] <cannap> mabe you can use position:fixed
[17:08:11] <cannap> to prevent scrollbar issues
[17:08:24] <cannap> but when you dont do you need to calculate
[17:08:45] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: this is what I mean
[17:08:46] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/34606/
[17:09:03] <Al_nz1> the date picker uses one format but the db returns another
[17:09:27] <hellyeah> hmm object can go out the page so i will need scroll bar probably
[17:09:32] <cannap> no
[17:09:35] <cannap> you need to calculate
[17:09:41] <cannap> the current position
[17:09:51] <cannap> and the width/height
[17:09:54] <hellyeah> cannap:  can you suggest me a reading for that + 25 thing i didnt understand how to calculate it
[17:09:56] <cannap> how much the object can go
[17:10:06] <cannap> i have no idea
[17:10:12] <hellyeah> mm
[17:10:15] <hellyeah> thats okey
[17:10:18] <cannap> logic thing
[17:10:20] <cannap> more not
[17:10:24] <hellyeah> object can go as long as it takes
[17:10:31] <cannap> instead of meter or what ever unit you use
[17:10:34] <cannap> its just pixel
[17:10:38] <hellyeah> of course there will be an end
[17:10:44] <cannap> say the room is 500 px the object is 50px
[17:10:52] <cannap> not you are at position 450px
[17:10:56] <cannap> check this on each move
[17:11:04] <cannap> not = now
[17:11:14] <cannap> and then when you try to go out of the 500 return
[17:12:04] <hellyeah> ghot it
[22:50:34] <will-y> hey, is it alright if I ask for help here?
[22:55:33] <sopparus> ask away
[22:56:57] <will-y> how would i set up a click listener for dynamically loaded elements in an iframe?
[22:57:57] <will-y> $("#iframe").contents().find("a").on('click', function(event) {});   works fine for existing links, but it doesnt register the click on dynamically added links
[23:40:13] <ElJeffe> hey guys
