[00:02:02] <Web> how to open up a jquery popup in href?
[00:02:02] <Web> onClick =?
[00:02:02] <Web> href=?
[00:04:23] <BrotherRodriguez> Web, you want to create an event listener on your link
[00:05:05] <BrotherRodriguez> $('#link_id').on('click', function (event) { event.preventDefault; YOUR FUNCTION HERE });
[00:09:43] <joyce_> BrotherRodriguez: http://jsfiddle.net/mdprF/ . The first two, using $.proxy, does not work. Whereas the third one works.
[00:15:02] <BrotherRodriguez> joyce, is there another reason you're using .proxy, or do you just want to remove any list item when it's clicked?
[00:17:27] <BrotherRodriguez> joyce_ this seems simpler, but I might be missing some of the functionality you're trying to build out: http://jsfiddle.net/beej/mdprF/1/
[00:18:04] <joyce_> That is just an example. I have faced this problem several times in the past.
[00:18:20] <joyce_> I'm trying to build a growl like notifier
[00:18:32] <_zoggy_> why reinvent the wheel?
[00:18:44] <_zoggy_> qtip2 / pines notify / etc
[00:18:45] <joyce_> I want the notification to be removed after n seconds and on click.
[00:19:28] <joyce_> _zoggy, I'm using bootstrap and considering that it contains most of the things I need the notification plugin is just 15 - 20 lines of code
[00:20:06] <BrotherRodriguez> Again, I'm no genius, but this seems to do it: http://jsfiddle.net/beej/mdprF/2/
[00:23:08] <joyce_> http://pastebin.com/JDXxCQuH here is the whole code.
[00:24:54] <joyce_> BrotherRodriguez: anonymous function works. I'm interested in how to do it with $.proxy
[00:26:51] <BrotherRodriguez> joyce_ : in a quick scan of the code, I notice you're using things like $msg
[00:26:59] <BrotherRodriguez> are you going for a jQuery select $(msg) ?
[00:27:14] <BrotherRodriguez> it looks like you're slipping into php variables
[00:28:20] <joyce_> $msg is the <li> element. I used $ prefix because it is a jQuery object
[00:28:43] <joyce_> Btw, setTimeout($(this).remove(), 2000); will  not work
[00:29:54] <BrotherRodriguez> You're right
[00:32:15] <BrotherRodriguez> I should probably just shut up. I'm getting confused by your example and I'm not even writing decent examples of my own.
[01:05:01] <LLLLL> how can I dock a div to the bottom of a window, similar to the way firebug lite does it
[01:05:58] <ernie_> in href="javascript: stuff" type of links in html, how can I escape " characters?  say I want to do alert('"')
[01:06:34] <LLLLL> you don't need to escape it to do that alert
[01:06:47] <LLLLL> oh wait
[01:07:17] <ernie_> i want to have both ' and " inside the javascript href.
[01:08:57] <LLLLL>  <a href="javascript:alert(\'%22\')">test</a>
[01:09:16] <LLLLL> err, type, \' should just be '
[01:09:20] <LLLLL> typo
[01:09:47] <LLLLL> basically if you are in a url use %22 for a quote
[02:04:44] <ravi> Hi, When I receive a json response in jquery instead of my javascript handling it browser is opening the json file. Any help?

[02:48:26] <ravi> ravenzz, do you have any idea on my issue
[02:50:53] <ravenzz> which one?
[02:51:12] <coldhead> ravi: i think your dataType is wrong
[02:51:18] <ravenzz> uhm yes
[02:51:19] <coldhead> it should just be 'json'
[02:51:52] <ravenzz> it would be better if you can show us your code
[02:53:45] <MoTiOnXml> isn't it weird that jQuery core + ui uses "event" as name of arguments? isn't "event" a reserved word?

[03:25:11] <nVee> Hey guys, does anyone know how to open a image in a jquery dialog box?
[03:25:28] <nVee> I tried $("imagelocation").dialog(); but it does not work
[03:27:09] <shesek> nVee, $() takes an CSS-like selector or a DOM element
[03:27:38] <nVee> hmmm, I see, so what would be the best to do this?
[03:27:41] <shesek> nVee, either already have an image element in your DOM and open that as a dialog, or create a new one and display that
[03:28:28] <nVee> well, for this purpose, the user will click on a thumbnail of the same image and I would like to open that in a dialog window
[03:29:01] <nVee> so am I understanding you correctly, I create a div, insert the image in that div and display it like that?
[03:29:23] <nVee> almost like $("<div>"+location+"</div>").dialog()?
[03:29:40] <shesek> it would work - but you don't need a div to contain the image, you can just use the actual <img> element
[03:30:04] <nVee> ah i see
[03:30:11] <nVee> let me try that quick
[03:30:12] <shesek> and you should probably use proper DOM manipulation functions to create the image, rather than creating it as a string
[03:30:14] <palani> hi hi
[03:30:26] <shesek> as an HTML string, that is
[03:30:29] <palani> i am new for jquery concepts
[03:30:52] <palani> any 1 help me r refer some good tutorial
[03:33:11] <nVee> shesek: Perfect!
[03:33:24] <nVee> it works, not as nice as I would have liked, but it works :)
[03:33:31] <shesek> nVee, <shesek> and you should probably use proper DOM manipulation functions to create the image, rather than creating it as a string
[03:33:45] <shesek> I hope you didn't end up with $('<img src='+src+'>').dialog() or something like that
[03:33:54] <nVee> oops :)
[03:33:59] <nVee> can you elaborate :)
[03:34:05] <nVee> sorry, I'm also pretty new
[03:34:55] <shesek> Use `$('<img>').attr({ src: '......'}).dialog()` instead
[03:35:04] <nVee> ahhh
[03:35:14] <nVee> let me do that quick
[03:36:01] <shesek> Also, instead of creating a new image every time, you could do `var $img = $('<img>')`
[03:36:20] <shesek> Than, when you need to display the image, `$img.attr('src', ...).dialog()`
[03:38:48] <nVee> hmmm
[03:39:24] <nVee> okay, what I'm doing is because I dont have a single image, I am using an each(), than if $(this).click()
[03:39:53] <nVee> but now I am not sure how to do it next as I cannot really do a $("img").attr("src").dialog()
[03:40:05] <nVee> wait
[03:40:08] <nVee> my bad!
[03:40:10] <nVee> lol
[03:41:43] <nVee> shesek: I have it as : $("<img>").attr({"src" : $(this.attr("src"))}).dialog({title: "Banner Preview:"});
[03:41:54] <nVee> but i'm assuming I have a syntax error somewhere
[03:43:06] <nVee> got it!
[03:43:43] <shesek> $(this.attr("src")) -> $(this).attr('src')
[03:43:57] <shesek> but you shouldn't turn everything into a jQuery object just because you can
[03:44:04] <shesek> `this.src` would work just as good
[03:44:33] <nVee> i never knew I could do that
[03:44:59] <shesek> and you can set the `title` as an element attribute instead of the options to `dialog()`, e.g. $('<img>').attr({ src: this.src, title: 'Banner Preview' }).dialog()
[03:45:28] <shesek> you never knew what? that you could do `this.src`?
[03:45:35] <nVee>  yeah :)
[03:45:53] <shesek> oh boy... do you even know JavaScript or jQuery or you're just copy-pasting-code and half-guessing what you're doing?
[03:46:12] <nVee> that's a bit crude isn't it?
[03:47:54] <nVee> I must have missed the area which says if you don't know everything you're definately just copy-pasting-code and half-guessing what i'm doing
[03:47:58] <nVee> but thanks anyways
[03:48:24] <shesek> nVee, perhaps - but I don't like people trying to write a program without knowing how to program first :-\
[03:48:45] <nVee> i'm a php developer, and I use jquery on the odd occasional basis
[03:49:00] <nVee> I don't use it daily and use it where required
[03:49:24] <nVee> no where did I copy paste the code, I just never knew I could use this.src as I use jquery when needed
[03:49:46] <nVee> but thanks for your help shesek
[03:50:12] <shesek> and still, I think that programming in a language to accomplish small specific tasks every time, without ever properly learning the language, is wrong
[03:50:36] <nVee> practise makes perfect?
[03:50:47] <shesek> and in general, I don't think that using jQuery without understand JavaScript/DOM is something that can work in the long term (or short, even)
[03:50:48] <nVee> so you're assumtion is that no one should program without knowing the language a-z?
[03:51:03] <nVee> assumption*
[03:51:23] <nVee> anyways, this topic isn't really going anywhere
[03:51:31] <shesek> no - my assumption is that no one should program without //wanting// to know the language at some point and going towards knowing it
[03:51:45] <nVee> isn't this what I am doing?
[03:52:12] <ravi> <coldhead> ravi: i think your dataType is wrong [02:51] <ravenzz> uhm yes [02:51] <coldhead> it should just be 'json'
[03:52:17] <ravi> I tried with pure json as well
[03:52:20] <ravi> but dint work
[03:52:36] <shesek> I don't you to know what you're doing, but it seems like many people don't actually want to know JavaScript at some point - they just want to know solutions to their specific problem at hand
[03:53:01] <shesek> (not a specific problem to JavaScript really, I see that in many other places too)
[03:53:15] <nVee> I mean I could have just skipped it entirely, but I decided that I would like to accomplish a topic, and although I managed to succeed in doing it, I was clearly not using "best practise". But, through willingness to learn (like I did here), I now know I can properties like "src" directly from the original created object
[03:53:40] <nVee> I hear what you're saying
[03:54:33] <nVee> but the fact that I am in a chatroom not asking "please do this for me" but rather "I tried this but it doesn't work" should put me in the class of someone who wants to learn as appose to having everything done for me :)
[03:54:51] <nVee> anyways, 2 people, 2 opinions
[03:55:24] <nVee> I will definately from here on forth refer to the already created object and use console.log(this) to see what is already available to me :)
[03:55:43] <Wiz_KeeD> Hello, is anyone here familiar with xml-rpc protocol in javascript/jquery?
[03:56:00] <nVee> you should ask shesek :P
[03:56:01] <nVee> hahaha
[03:56:09] <nVee> chat a bit later :)
[03:57:38] <shesek> nVee, well ,yeah, you're definitely a whole lot better than some other people coming here
[03:57:54] <shesek> and I think I have misjudged you. I apologize :-)
[03:59:24] <shesek> I'm just a bit annoyed by people (here, other channels, stackoverflow) constantly asking for other people to write code for them / fix some code they hacked together by copy-pasting from different sources
[04:00:50] <Wiz_KeeD> xml-rpc anyone?
[04:06:10] <kratsg> Does anyone know why $.resizable ignores the grid when 'animate' is true?
[04:18:41] <ravi> When I receive a json response in jquery instead of my javascript handling it browser is opening the json file
[04:19:02] <ravi> sorry for askign again, i am tired of this
[04:20:44] <Hackwar> hi folks, what happens when I'm loading different versions of jquery on one page? Do they co-exist side by side in peace or does one overwrite the other in memory?
[05:23:53] <wojtek> hi, I’m looking for a tooltip widget as simple as possible as in Facebook
[05:27:24] <nocturnal> any shortcut to get the HTTP code from a post?
[05:27:47] <nocturnal> right now I'm having the CGI print it
[05:27:54] <Wizek> hi
[05:28:11] <Wizek> why won't this work: $('iframe#bar').contents().find('head').append('<script type="text/javascript" src="/file.js"></script>') ?
[05:29:00] <Wizek> It only seems to dismiss script with src attribute on it
[05:29:09] <Wizek> I was able to append pretty mutch everything else
[05:31:30] <James13433> Should preventDefault(); stop any onclick events also aswell as stopping the link from going ot the href?
[05:32:02] <nocturnal> I used transport.status
[05:39:20] <wojtek> James13433: preventDefault() only prevents from default action related to an element – so it only stops from following an anchor in links
[05:39:34] <wojtek> for anchors of course
[05:40:43] <wojtek> guys, is it possible to wrap any clicked text node with sth in any paragraph?
[05:41:36] <wojtek> for example, I would like to wrap double-clicked word with a span.special
[05:42:23] <gf3> wojtek: probably with some contentEditable/text selection hax

[05:47:15] <Azareth> Hi
[05:47:35] <Azareth> can someone advice me a good calendar(not datetime picker) widget?
[05:48:19] <Azareth> I want to be albe to show events on it and to mark periods and then get the marked time range, sometihng like Google Calendar?
[05:48:49] <gf3> Azareth: did you even try google?
[05:49:37] <Azareth> gf3 : I want something that cna be embeded on my website and the data to be kept in my DB not Googles
[05:49:48] <gf3> no
[05:49:50] <gf3> use google
[05:49:56] <gf3> to find the answer to your question
[05:53:24] <Azareth> yes I have but found tons of datepickers
[05:53:55] <troubleman> I'm trying to close my jQuery UI Dialog when clicking outside it (based on www.ryanjeffords.com/blog/entry/closing-a-jquery-ui-dialog-when-the-dialog-loses-focus) - but which of these snippets are best? Both work: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/VdueH/
[05:54:32] <ribot> hi
[05:54:43] <coz> Hi all - when using jQuery 1.7.1 with IE7, if you repeat a selector, is it expected that you would get a Sizzle error? For example if you simply open the console and do: $('a'); $('a'); - the second one results in an error.
[05:54:53] <troubleman> And can y'all think of a better name than overlayClickExit? exitOnClick maybe?
[05:55:35] <ribot> i'm trying to use static tabs in jqui, the problem is that when i click a link the whole frame is recreated inside the tab content area
[05:56:23] <ribot> things outside the tab content area gets loaded into the content area, so how are you actually suppose to use it intelligebly?
[05:56:29] <gf3> troubleman: use the one with .live
[05:57:06] <gf3> ribot: you'll have to make a JSFiddle illustrating your issue
[05:58:07] <troubleman> gf3: why the .live one?
[05:58:23] <gf3> troubleman: because it will work on future elements
[05:58:36] <Cine> how would I set the .html of an element but ignore a particular selector?
[05:58:50] <gf3> troubleman: ahh, nvm
[05:58:58] <gf3> troubleman: the first one delegates as well
[05:59:06] <troubleman> gf3: I tried but dialog won't work in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/KnSS3/6/
[05:59:11] <gf3> troubleman: both are fine, they do the same thing, the second is just more concise
[05:59:28] <troubleman> cool
[05:59:31] <troubleman> the second it is then!! :D
[05:59:39] <troubleman> can i get a second opinion on that though? anyone?
[05:59:50] <ribot> gf3: it is quite clear that when you put a href in a tab it is loaded with ajax, but it loads the whole page and puts it inside the tab's content area, so it makes the outer structure come inside the tab area
[06:00:12] <troubleman> gf3: what you think of the name though?
[06:02:26] <gf3> troubleman: it's not loading jQUI properly
[06:04:16] <troubleman> oh i see
[06:07:48] <Ziggy`> I've got async on for AJAX calls, I'm making a couple of calls, but when a new call is up, it waits for the last 10 ones that were waiting, how can I demand that one specific call gets in front of line?
[06:09:02] <coz> Filing a bug about the IE7 issue I found - I fill in the form, get told that it might be spam, fine, I enter the capthca. Then get told that there is a trac error. Is there a bug filing bugs or am I missing something?
[06:11:28] <nFFF> Guys, have a a string in html that I want to put n<span> tag around first word
[06:11:37] <nFFF> Any jQuery functions to help with this
[06:12:20] <nVee> I have a button in the 4th td in a tr row. How can I get the html value of the 1st td in that row?
[06:12:55] <coz> @nFFF: not jQuery as such, but direct string manipulation would do it: var a = s.split(' '); a[0] = '<span>'+a[0]+'</span>'; s = a.join(' ');
[06:13:34] <coz> @nVee: $(this).parents('tr').find('td:eq(0)')
[06:13:49] <nVee> The 4th TD has a [edit] button. Once you click on that button, I have a lightbox opening with form fields. I want the form fields to populate with the content within that row in which the edit button is located :)
[06:13:57] <nVee> let me test coz :)
[06:13:59] <nVee> thank you
[06:14:48] <nFFF> mvar me = $(this); me.html(me.html().replace(/^(\w+)/, '<span>$1</span>'));
[06:15:04] <nFFF> coz, whats the difference between the above and your way?
[06:16:36] <coz> either would work fine. Would be interesting to profile each method and see which is faster
[06:16:54] <bjensen> Normally a plugin is initialized in a document.ready({       $(".foo").do_cool_stuff();}      ), but what if I need it to initialize on some content that is retrieved through ajax? Isn't there a prettier way than have the above call be a part of the content in a $.get?
[06:18:14] <gf3> bjensen: why can't you do your initialization in the success callback of your $.get?
[06:19:15] <bjensen> gf3: I could, but how would I handle the differences? I mean if the url for /users/edit is fetch then initialize this, otherwise initiallze that..
[06:19:37] <bjensen> gf3: right now I have a general function for fetching content using ajax
[06:19:52] <gf3> bjensen: well you have control over the code doing the initial fetching
[06:20:14] <bjensen> can you point to a resource that shows me how to do this in a proper way please?
[06:20:49] <gf3> bjensen: I don't know of any off the top of my head, you can check how backbone.js does similar things with collections
[06:21:10] <bjensen> gf3: hmm ok
[06:22:27] <gf3> bjensen: of course you could always use some generic router (which is what I'd recommend)
[06:22:39] <bjensen> generic router? :)
[06:23:02] <nFFF> coz, how would we benchmark this :p
[06:23:06] <nFFF> Id be interested to know
[06:23:35] <gf3> bjensen: http://microjs.com/#spa
[06:24:12] <coz> @nFFF: http://jsperf.com/ - would need to create a test case for each case and then the site takes care of it (basically does it in a loop to see how it performs)
[06:25:23] <bjensen> gf3: the ajax stuff?
[06:25:47] <gf3> bjensen: the routing stuff
[06:27:04] <bjensen> gf3: sorry mate. But there is no routing category :-/
[06:27:40] <gf3> bjensen: yes I know, but they have routers in the category that I linked you
[06:27:45] <gf3> bjensen: Single Page Apps
[06:28:10] <bjensen> I see now. Thanks
[06:28:23] <bjensen> and thanks for the link. :)
[06:28:29] <bjensen> looks like it could be quite handy
[06:29:18] <gf3> bjensen: np
[06:29:41] <gf3> bjensen: another option is to implement a pubsub in your general function
[06:29:53] <bjensen> Id rather not :)
[06:37:13] <UukGoblin> hi

[06:42:22] <UukGoblin> oh, right, what the server returns needs to be javascript... I vaguely recall some iframe hack that could achieve it...
[06:43:23] <gf3> UukGoblin: you need a server proxy
[06:48:31] <UukGoblin> gf3, I was hoping I could write a static .html page just opened from local disk that could retrieve some stats from various sources :-)
[06:48:50] <UukGoblin> I'm trying to avoid to use a webserver :-S
[06:48:59] <gf3> UukGoblin: unfortunately not
[06:49:14] <gf3> UukGoblin: servers can be fun and easy, check out node.js!
[06:50:50] <UukGoblin> hang on... is that a webserver-in-a-browser? ;-)
[06:50:56] <UukGoblin> or just using the runtime ;-)
[06:51:15] <gf3> UukGoblin: http://nodejs.org/
[06:51:24] <UukGoblin> yeah that's where I looked
[06:51:54] <UukGoblin> it looks like a standalone binary
[06:52:04] <UukGoblin> anyway, thanks for the help, I'll go figure something out :-)

[07:18:24] <Cameron> anyone????

[07:21:32] <Cameron> oh
[07:21:38] <Prasath> Hi i want to add jqquery mobile attribute such as data-role via jquery. How to do that?
[07:21:41] <Cameron> actually
[07:21:45] <Cameron> erichynds, try again now
[07:21:52] <Cameron> i think you mght of seen it at another time
[07:22:03] <Prasath> will jquery mobile ctchup the attributes added via jquery?
[07:22:04] <erichynds> still works
[07:22:05] <UukGoblin> gf3, awesome, CORS looks like a perfect solution for me :-)
[07:22:05] <Cameron> when i was working out whats working and wahts not
[07:22:08] <Cameron> huh
[07:22:10] <Cameron> what browser?
[07:22:13] <erichynds> chrome
[07:22:18] <UukGoblin> gf3, smalles amount of changes on the stats-providing servers
[07:22:49] <Cameron> in the consolse theres no error? erichynds?
[07:22:53] <erichynds> nope
[07:23:18] <Cameron> soo what am i getting an error!? lol
[07:23:20] <Cameron> wtf!?
[07:23:32] <erichynds> clear your cache?
[07:23:39] <Cameron> i have
[07:24:23] <Cameron> register.php:416Uncaught ReferenceError: RegionSelectBox is not defined
[07:24:26] <Cameron> still getting that!?
[07:24:33] <Cameron> new RegionSelectBox('AccountCreate');
[07:24:35] <Cameron> on that line
[07:25:17] <Cameron> what do you see erichynds, is it just a plain html page or is there an image saying "GothamAds" at the top on a black bg?
[07:37:33] <coz> don't suppose any one can explain why the following would result in "1 3" being shown on the console? I just can't figure it out…
[07:37:34] <coz> var tbody = $(this).children('tbody');
[07:37:35] <coz> console.log( tbody.length, $(this).children('tbody').length );
[07:37:51] <coz> 'this' is a table
[07:38:04] <Remon> Does anybody know how you can target a spesific id in a iframe loaded by fancybox lightbox?
[07:39:11] <dabear> coz: you must have an error in your code somewhere:p
[07:41:56] <coz> @dabear: heh - that's what I figured as well. But I just can't see how the same command will give two different results!
[07:42:12] <dabear> it can't
[07:42:25] <dabear> need to see code
[07:42:28] <dabear> jfsiddle it
[07:43:45] <coz> its thousands of lines unfortunately, but the error is occurring on those  two lines. Something odd going on :-)
[07:44:19] <dabear> well, can you give me access over the internet?
[07:44:37] <coz> sure one sec
[07:49:15] <coz> @dabear: http://datatables.net/dev/tbody/examples/basic_init/themes.html - source is at: http://datatables.net/dev/tbody/media/js/jquery.dataTables.js
[07:49:40] <coz> search for console.log (skipping over the first three hits)
[07:50:11] <coz> it almost seems that the children function is sometimes taking the filter into account, and sometimes not
[07:53:44] <dabear> hehe, so strange, I agree
[07:53:49] <dabear> I set a breakpoint
[07:53:52] <dabear> and added console.log( tbody.length, $(this).children('tbody').length );
[07:53:55] <dabear> and then again
[07:54:00] <dabear> I get different results
[07:54:03] <dabear> sometimes 1 1
[07:54:06] <dabear> and sometimes 1 3
[07:54:56] <dabear> coz: kinda seems the tbodies are removes from the table temporarily
[07:55:01] <dabear> removed*
[07:55:09] <coz> I've just added a small modification - so the first output line now gives the length for the numebr of chidren, the length for the children filtered on tbody and the children with tbody
[07:55:17] <dabear> and that's what's causing this issue
[07:56:20] <coz> but the DOM isn't modified at all in those debug lines (the createElement's aren't needed in this case)
[07:56:24] <dabear> tbody.length only checks a collection for its members
[07:56:42] <dabear> while the children check is looking up the dom again
[07:56:58] <coz> yup - if there is no body - then it needs to add one
[07:59:43] <dabear> coz: $(this).find(">tbody").length always gives me 1
[08:00:16] <coz> Just uploaded a slightly modified version which will hopefulyl mgith the code slightly clearer
[08:00:55] <coz> I used to use ">…", but I was under the impression that chlidren() should be used instead
[08:02:38] <dabear> coz: $(this).children().map( function(){ return this.tagName})
[08:02:39] <dabear> ["THEAD", "TBODY", "TFOOT"]
[08:03:50] <coz> just uploaded that and that makes sense
[08:03:59] <coz> and the children selector is working on that as well
[08:05:01] <coz> ouch - but not on the tbody variable
[08:05:08] <dabear> so the correct value is 1
[08:05:46] <Guest67565> How to say it in jquery language?- onclick="document.getElementById('captchaimage').src = 'captcha.php?' + Math.random(); return false"
[08:06:27] <coz> is children returning the parent rather than the children, and only keeping the children in use for the context of that chining
[08:06:38] <coz> chaining*
[08:07:43] <dabear> coz: could you try using jquery 1.6 ?
[08:07:48] <dabear> just temporarily
[08:07:49] <coz> certainly
[08:07:58] <dabear> might be a regression
[08:08:24] <zatan> Hi can anyone look at this I cant get it working scrollpane http://jsfiddle.net/uFMmQ/ ?
[08:08:43] <coz> dabear: 1.6.4 uploaded
[08:09:50] <dabear> hm, same
[08:15:03] <dabear> coz: it seems to be consistent
[08:15:15] <dabear> I get 1 element, then 3, then 1, then 3 etc
[08:15:15] <dabear> https://skitch.com/bjorninge/gs5me/datatables-example
[08:15:16] <coz> yeah - and across browsers a well
[08:15:57] <coz> this is one of the oddest things I've come across!
[08:19:09] <dabear> coz: at least this gets you what you want: $(this).children().filter( function(){ return this.tagName.toLowerCase() === "tbody";})
[08:19:34] <coz> I think i can reproduce it without all the DataTables gubbins - just setting up a test case
[08:20:54] <dabear> coz: would help if you added the un minified version of jquery so I can step up and see what is causing it
[08:21:06] <Guest420_> How to say it in jQuery?? (to insert this reload-captcha code to my comment script) - onclick="document.getElementById('captchaimage').src = 'captcha.php?' + Math.random(); return false"
[08:21:11] <dabear> but a test case is always best
[08:21:23] <Guest420_> otherwise just have to user this current Reload link w onclick thingy
[08:21:52] <dabear> Guest420_: look at "click", "attr" and event.preventdefault at the docs: api.jquery.com
[08:22:07] <Guest420_> thx, will do
[08:22:18] <coz> dabear: uncompressed jQuery 1.7.1 uploaded
[08:22:21] <dabear> and look at the selectors too
[08:23:45] <dabear> coz: upload a test case
[08:23:50] <dabear> as you said
[08:23:55] <dabear> much easier to debug
[08:25:58] <coz> I've just narrowed it down to the syntax highlighting library. If I load that onto the page then we get this 'weirdness'. If I don't, then all is good and everything works as expected
[08:26:22] <coz> I would say an async timing problem, but it is too consistent for that
[08:26:36] <dabear> it is not an async timing problem
[08:26:45] <dabear> javascript is single threaded
[08:26:53] <dabear> I set a breakpoint
[08:27:00] <dabear> which means halting everything else
[08:27:06] <dabear> and I still got the error
[08:27:11] <coz> http://datatables.net/dev/tbody/examples/basic_init/test.html
[08:27:25] <dabear> so yout hilightinh library most likely overrides .children
[08:27:28] <coz> without datatables - just the syntax highlgihting
[08:28:17] <coz> the syntax highligther ( https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/SyntaxHighlighter ) doesn't use jQuery at all
[08:28:37] <coz> althought I suppose it might be mucking around with object prototypes
[08:30:12] <dabear> coz: ignore the tbody variable
[08:30:19] <dabear> console.log( $(n).children('a').length, $(n).children('a').length ); demonstrates the problem
[08:30:20] <dabear> too
[08:32:59] <Guest420> aaight, thanks bear, i got it to reload it
[08:34:04] <Matiasu> Hello!
[08:35:43] <Matiasu> is it a good idea to include scripts using .getScript? I have found it includes the file even if it has been previously included, aka: no cache
[08:36:36] <dabear> Matiasu: use script tags instead if you can
[08:36:49] <coz> dabear: Got it - it is an override of RegExp.prototype.exec in XRegExp that is causing the problem. Doh! Without that then everything is sensible - how very annoying
[08:36:52] <dabear> coz: where is the script altering prototpes?
[08:37:04] <dabear> heh, ok
[08:37:14] <dabear> you kinda answered my question before I asked it
[08:37:17] <coz> unbelieveable… the air was turning blue!
[08:37:28] <coz> thanks so much for staying with me on this one
[08:37:33] <Guest420> How to add a random-number (number/date/time) generating thingy to this??-       $('#captchaimage').fadeOut("fast").load('captcha.php').fadeIn("slow");
[08:37:39] <coz> I'll dig into that library and see if I can figure out what is going on
[08:37:56] <Matiasu> I mean, I can but I'm considering sending the file in the same request that says "add this script for me", it doesn't make sense to use two request (one with the filename and another one to get the file) if it doesn't apply any kind of cache
[08:37:59] <Matiasu> what do you think?
[08:38:00] <dabear> coz: you should know that using jquery when prototypes of builtins are changes, is totally unsupported
[08:38:14] <dabear> changed**
[08:38:22] <reative> ...load(page1.html)
[08:38:28] <reative> ...load(page2.html)
[08:38:51] <reative> will the pages load at the same time or succesive?=
[08:39:08] <coz> dabear: I'm not suprised! Supporting anything with 3rd party overriding prototypes would be a nightmare! But cross that this library does it
[08:39:16] <dabear> reative: they will load async
[08:40:08] <reative> ok thanks
[08:40:22] <reative> thats a problem
[08:42:03] <Matiasu> with some request the server ask the client to include some scripts (it sends the filenames) so then all I do is .getScript(...). it doesn't cache anything, so I think a better idea is to send the code instead of the filenames, it's the same but I use just one request instead of two
[08:42:06] <Matiasu> what do you think?
[08:43:54] <dabear> coz: lol @ // Fix browser bug in native method
[08:43:55] <dabear> RegExp.prototype.test = function (str) {
[08:43:57] <Matiasu> actually if I have to include n scripts it's doing n+1 request at the moment, every time the user go to the section that requires it. it doesn't sound good
[08:44:07] <dabear> coz: that is just insane
[08:44:40] <coz> dabear: sigh :-(
[08:45:03] <coz> it should be banned
[08:47:02] <dabear> coz: it overrides apply,call,exec,test,match of the regex object, in addition to regex related stuff on String
[08:47:13] <dabear> no wonder sizzle breaks
[08:49:11] <Guest420> ok, i wrote (found,copied) two functions for reloading captcha - http://pastebin.com/zF4uydvM - how to load these functions?
[08:50:13] <dabear> Guest420: learn jquery. sorry but this is fundamental
[08:50:30] <Guest420> yes, it probably is, ok, ill dig around
[08:51:02] <dabear> this isn't something you sohuld need to ask, after reading http://api.jquery.com/click/ and http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[08:52:10] <coz> debear: Looking at all the overrides just wants to make me cry
[08:52:46] <coz> teach me to include 3rd party code without looking at it a bit closer
[08:53:36] <dabear> yeah, just go to teachmetoinclude3dpartycode.com thx
[08:53:53] <coz> heh
[08:56:21] <dabear> I guess what is happening here is that the xregex switches between its own implementation and the native implementation based on the regex provided
[08:56:33] <dabear> that regex might be different for each tag name
[08:56:51] <coz> and the features in the host browser persumably
[08:56:58] <dabear> yep
[08:57:00] <coz> its a bit nasty really
[08:57:16] <coz> time to start loking for a different syntax highlighter I think
[08:57:39] <coz> not liking having that near my development environment too much
[09:01:34] <netxshare> anyone know if there is a div gridview plugin for jquery?
[09:16:44] <fatninja> I want to make a form grouping, so when the user clicks next it would hide the current one and go to the next, I do have a question , my button is an <a> and if it has href it goes there, I don't want that so I removed href, but I also want to act as a link so that hand will appear on hover, any ideas ?
[09:17:18] <Guest420> href=="#" ?
[09:17:36] <Guest420> and i think you can use <a></a> without href too
[09:17:51] <Guest420> plus u can use css cursor:pointer;
[09:18:00] <Guest420> on whatever elements :hover
[09:19:02] <fatninja> I see
[09:19:06] <fatninja> I managed to do
[09:19:38] <fatninja> make it work by returning false;
[09:19:55] <Guest420> interesting
[09:28:59] <Guest420> How to load them two functions i have?? http://pastebin.com/kgEtKb2i
[09:29:15] <Guest420> sorry bear, i really dont fancy learning jquery right now
[09:30:08] <Guest420> just hopin for a answer
[09:35:27] <Guest420> naah i better quit this stupid begging  for answers
[09:35:31] <Guest420> that way i wont anything
[09:39:46] <fatninja> how to go to a specific anchor ? using query :/
[09:39:50] <fatninja> without refreshing the page
[09:40:45] <ravenzz> fatninja what do you mean?
[09:41:04] <ravenzz> load the content of the clicked link into the same page?
[09:41:23] <fatninja> I have a long form, and at the bottom I have next, that actually hides the current div , and makes another one available, but when I click next I want it to go back on top
[09:41:42] <fatninja> in my case , the page stays down
[09:42:10] <ravenzz> what is "next" an anchor?
[09:42:48] <fatninja> hmm wait a minute :P
[09:43:52] <ravenzz> fatninja http://jsfiddle.net/QRukW/
[09:44:58] <fatninja> I think I've done it, simply by creating <a name="beginning"></a> and it worked
[09:45:43] <fatninja> the thing is, I thought that #kalsdk would refresh the page
[09:46:18] <ravenzz> I don't get it
[09:49:57] <cybersholt> after noon all does anyone know the best way to combine / minify jq plugins ?
[09:57:00] <TheDragoon> Evenin all :)
[09:57:13] <cybersholt> hello
[09:58:17] <TheDragoon> I'm trying to fix some collision detection but the way I do it is way to heavy... Anyone has suggestions for a simple but effective collision detection?
[09:59:43] <cybersholt> i just was looking @ a html 5 demo the other day
[10:00:05] <cybersholt> and it had nice snappy collision detection http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/ball_pool/
[10:00:21] <cybersholt> maybe that will help ya
[10:00:35] <ajpiano> cybersholt: i gotta restart, but check out these two projects
[10:00:37] <ajpiano> https://github.com/cowboy/grunt
[10:00:49] <TheDragoon> ahh looks nice thanks cybersholt.
[10:00:50] <ajpiano> https://github.com/fat/smoosh
[10:01:15] <cybersholt> thanks ajpiano and np dragon
[10:04:49] <cornfeed> how do I get a variable to persist outside of a function?
[10:05:05] <cybersholt> ajpiano: is it a pain in the arse installing node on windows?
[10:05:12] <ajpiano> cybersholt: no, not anymore
[10:05:20] <ajpiano> there's a binary installer
[10:05:24] <ajpiano> http://nodejs.org/#download
[10:05:38] <cybersholt> cool im gonna try the smoosh seems pretty good
[10:06:01] <cybersholt> oh nice they got a windowz installer!
[10:06:15] <ajpiano> yep
[10:06:22] <ajpiano> i've used smoosh in an app fo sho'
[10:07:19] <cybersholt> cool cool i got about 12 files i would like to merge, would it be best to input non minified versions before i compress?
[10:07:28] <ajpiano> cybersholt: yes
[10:07:43] <cybersholt> thats what i thought cool
[10:07:44] <ajpiano> trying to minify stuff that's already been minified can result in #fail
[10:07:45] <ajpiano> :(
[10:08:07] <cybersholt> yea since they use common variable names when u minify
[10:08:12] <cybersholt> like a b c
[10:08:31] <cybersholt> i can tell ya jq and this irc are a life saver
[10:08:42] <ajpiano> some of the minifcation tactics just fail also, like if you try to run something minified by closure compiler through uglify, etc.
[10:08:54] <ajpiano> hehe
[10:09:02] <cybersholt> oh ok thanks
[10:12:43] <cornfeed> how do I get a variable to persist outside of a function?
[10:14:33] <gf3> cornfeed: generally a bad idea, but declare it outside of the function
[10:15:16] <TheDragoon> cybersholt any chance you know a Jquery based collision system?
[10:15:31] <TheDragoon> (or someone else)
[10:16:34] <cybersholt> no sorry maybe this will help ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4230029/jquery-javascript-collision-detection
[10:20:59] <cornfeed> well i need to pull an ajaz request that sets a variable for later reference. defining outside the function doesnt seem to do anything
[10:23:46] <humanpipecleaner> hey guys, when i do $("textarea").val() it's returning "Hello \n->"humanpipecleaner"". but that's not a valid string, and it's giving me a lot of trouble
[10:24:17] <cornfeed> http://dpaste.org/rL3P9/  its not clean because I was messing around and posted it up without cleaning, but you should get the picture
[10:24:31] <humanpipecleaner> when i try to do a regex to get rid of the "inner" double quotes, it doesn't work because of the way tit's formatted
[10:25:35] <cornfeed> humanpipecleaner: regex is the only way i can think of
[10:26:10] <shadykhan> what are some websites you guys visit for web related articles and tuts?
[10:26:29] <humanpipecleaner> cornfeed: but it's actually returning something ass backwards "hello \n->" humanpipecleaner "", is two strings with and undefined variable in the middle, ya dig
[10:27:15] <cornfeed> is this a multiline textbox?
[10:30:42] <cornfeed> still no luck http://dpaste.org/EIwVa/
[10:31:54] <stakhanov> Any suggestions on solving this, anyone? (http://jsfiddle.net/G5fcc/4/) Already have some ideas, but I want to see any suggestions...
[10:32:39] <cornfeed> stakhanov: want it to stop flickering?
[10:33:33] <stakhanov> Yes.
[10:34:12] <sphinxxx> need a little help with jquery ui tabs
[10:34:26] <sphinxxx> i want to return json frmo the server, not html
[10:34:32] <sphinxxx> how can i do that?
[10:36:00] <Anime> stakhanov: http://jsfiddle.net/G5fcc/7/ ?
[10:37:01] <cornfeed> stakhanov: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4422291/jquery-hover-flickering
[10:38:45] <cornfeed> when the green block is showing you are no longer hovering over #button an so it disappears and then you are hovering so it draws it
[10:41:20] <stakhanov> the green button does not disappears though when hovering out of the cyan button....
[10:41:55] <stakhanov> ...on http://jsfiddle.net/G5fcc/7/
[10:42:32] <stakhanov> only when hovering out of the green box.
[10:43:08] <stakhanov> The point is to hide the green box when the cursor either exits the green and/or cyan box.
[10:49:35] <cornfeed> well this is a bit closer :-/  http://jsfiddle.net/G5fcc/14/
[10:51:22] <cornfeed> i guess you could add a timer?
[10:52:20] <stakhanov> Here is my somehow "ugly" solution (http://jsfiddle.net/G5fcc/15/).
[10:52:56] <stakhanov> But it get quite complicated when working with multiple menus, submenus, etc.
[10:54:22] <tomasm-> hi, i'm trying to set up a jquery function that a button click triggers opening a form, but clicking outside of the form will close it back up (display:none).... I thought of putting in document.bind('click'), and then a $(form).click(function { e.stopPropogation(); }) so clicking OUTSIDE of the box will close it, but assigning the click to document causes it to be triggered immediately since it was a click that caused the whole thing...
[10:54:22] <tomasm->  any ideas around this?
[10:57:27] <stakhanov> tomasm: maybe create a variable like var form_displayed = false/true and then check on the click()?
[10:57:36] <cornfeed> i think you did i t the best
[10:57:40] <tomasm-> nevermind, i called e.stopPropogation() on the first click so document.click wont be triggered first time around
[10:58:00] <cornfeed> can someone please take a look at this and tell me why it is not saving my variable http://dpaste.org/EIwVa/
[11:02:37] <stakhanov> cornfeed: what kind of errors does your console pops out?
[11:03:11] <stakhanov> does the alert box pops out at all?
[11:04:11] <cornfeed> no errors, popup box simply says undefined
[11:04:24] <cornfeed> i can not for my life get this variable to be global
[11:04:43] <stakhanov> what kind of data (in what form) is returned from the server?
[11:04:53] <cornfeed> string
[11:06:15] <cornfeed> http://dpaste.org/KZqSv/ that returns item1|item2|item3
[11:07:13] <stakhanov> http://dpaste.org/YnJ5O/
[11:07:52] <stakhanov> so maybe response.split("
[11:07:54] <stakhanov> ")
[11:08:02] <stakhanov> sorry... response.split("
[11:08:06] <stakhanov> oops.
[11:08:14] <stakhanov> response.split("|");
[11:08:33] <cornfeed> nope it is sending the alert box before the response box
[11:08:47] <cornfeed> #3 for #2
[11:09:08] <PhonicUK> can I modify the definition for an entire class via jquery?
[11:09:13] <cornfeed> well that is interesting
[11:11:24] <stakhanov> alert($.output[0])?
[11:11:34] <stakhanov> split should return an array...
[11:11:56] <stakhanov> http://jsfiddle.net/tGurE/
[11:12:27] <cornfeed> so it was working the whole time. i just wasnt seeing because the alert box pops faster than the response :-P
[11:13:03] <cornfeed> after attaching the alert box action to another element's .click() i was able to see that it indeed saves the variable properly
[11:13:21] <cornfeed> i could scream...
[11:13:26] <cornfeed> or cry...whatever
[11:21:32] <mightym> hey guys, I'm new to query and wonder how one would solve this: i have a element, absolute positioned i want it moving according to scrollTop(). but id like to add the value to the initial position of my object. right now my object is f.e. just moving from 0 to 900 y, but id like to start at its initial position f.e. y = 50
[11:26:47] <cornfeed> http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[11:28:12] <thebignoise> http://pastie.org/3144679 -- the first time the code works great the second time the animate opacity: 1 doesnt animate just pops right to 1 opacity
[11:28:23] <thebignoise> is there a bug in my code?
[11:28:43] <thebignoise> its called by an .click event
[11:31:31] <Rndnick> hi

[11:35:11] <nbari> I need help with a regex, on an input text field I want to avoid this chars: /[^"\r\n\.,'\?\!;\:#\$%&\(\)\*\+\-\/\<\>\=@\[\]\\\^_\{\}\|~]+$/.test(value);
[11:35:35] <nbari> i just want to accept a-Z0-9 but also ñ ç à etc
[11:36:30] <nbari> the problem that I am having with this regex: /[^"\r\n\.,'\?\!;\:#\$%&\(\)\*\+\-\/\<\>\=@\[\]\\\^_\{\}\|~]+$/.test(value); is that ajust match the beggining
[11:36:56] <nbari> if I type an space it breaks
[11:40:49] <shesek> nbari, why make a blacklist of characters when what you actually want is a whitelist?
[11:42:03] <nbari> I want to accept full utf8 chars but exclude just few of theme
[11:42:34] <nbari> I want to avoid something like <?php on the input text
[11:49:34] <cybersholt> nbari: have you tried processing that server side with mysql_real_escape_string ?
[11:50:16] <nbari> mmm no, I was thinking on a regex to avoid waisting resources
[11:50:55] <cybersholt> you would be waiting any resources processing it with php
[11:51:02] <cybersholt> wasting *
[11:53:23] <shesek> nbari, you do realize that any client-side protection against that can be overridden by the user, right?
[11:53:26] <shesek> you can trust any user input
[11:54:52] <nbari> the server side is working fine, is just that I would like to prevent more posts with invalid data for avoiding inecesary trafic
[11:57:11] <shesek> nbari, what is this field?
[11:57:22] <nbari> full name
[11:58:38] <nbari> and I would like to accept names like: "João Coração" and avoid something like "Joã<?+.,,,"
[12:03:39] <radiantstatic> I've got a div with a set width and a horizontal navigation thats bigger than the set width? I'd like for the ability to pan the internal content left/right with some arrows. What's the best way of going about this?

[12:05:04] <bjensen> Um what is the prettiest way to do a .find to find all those elements who has a 'data-user-id' value that is the array [1,2,3] ?
[12:09:45] <cornfeed> $.ajaxSetup({async:false});  this is what i needed the whole time!!!!!!
[12:10:43] <hightekvagabond1> syncronis ajax is bad… just because you can doesn't mean you should
[12:13:28] <Joni> Is it possible to just change the backgroundposition _top_ value somehow?
[12:14:12] <Joni> I have $('.buttons') i want to do this on, but the left value has to stay the same
[12:14:18] <shesek> Joni, el.style.backgrounPositionTop = 123
[12:14:32] <shesek> $('.buttons').css({ backgrounPositionTop: 123 })
[12:14:40] <Joni> u sure that works?
[12:14:42] <Joni> think i tried it
[12:14:53] <shesek> or $('.buttons').css('background-position-top', 123)
[12:14:55] <shesek> yep, it does
[12:16:39] <Joni> nah it didnt
[12:16:50] <Joni> the thing is that u cant do it in css either
[12:17:13] <Joni> I mean there is no background-position-top in css
[12:18:35] <shesek> oh
[12:18:51] <shesek> yeah, that confused me :-)
[12:19:26] <shesek> I guess you'll have to read the current background-position, take the current left position, and re-set both of them
[12:20:00] <Joni> Yes i guess, can i do this in jquery some smart way, or should i just loop through all .button?
[12:20:26] <hightekvagabond1> .position() doesn't give you what you want?
[12:20:33] <Joni> my knowledge of jquery is not very good =)
[12:20:38] <shesek> hightekvagabond1, its background position
[12:22:04] <shesek> Joni, no, no special way
[12:22:09] <shesek> something like
[12:22:12] <Joni> Found something called .each()
[12:22:21] <Joni> should make it a bit easier atleast
[12:22:47] <Joni> then just do a string split in javascript on the background-position css
[12:22:53] <shesek> $('.buttons').each(function(){  this.style.backgroundPosition = this.style.backgroundPosition.substr(0, this.style.backgroundPosition.indexOf(' ')) + ' 100px';  })
[12:22:57] <shesek> or, hmm, no
[12:23:02] <shesek> do something like this
[12:23:16] <Joni> heh yeah i know by myself now =) ty!
[12:24:54] <shesek> $.fn.bgPos = function(type, value) { this.each(function() { var parts = this.style.backgroundPosition.split(' '); parts[type === 'top' ? 0 : 1] = value; this.style.backgroundPosition =parts.join(' '); }); }
[12:24:55] <shesek> than
[12:25:00] <shesek> $('.buttons').bgPos('top
[12:25:05] <shesek> $('.buttons').bgPos('top', '100px')
[12:25:18] <shesek> Implement it however you like, but add it as an method on $.fn to make it re-usable
[12:25:39] <Joni> Oh good idea!
[12:26:16] <Joni> jquery should add this stuff for cssproperties like this
[12:27:37] <InDigital> happy new and the last year 2012 :D
[12:42:42] <Nicklas``> Hi
[12:44:12] <Nicklas``> A little question about jquery-ui API, from an object (a javascript variable) how can I know if my object is a widget or not
[12:46:01] <Eviltwin> You mean like $("#myelement")
[12:46:08] <Eviltwin> How can you know if that's a particular widget?
[12:46:13] <Nicklas``> In my case, I have an object from a selector ($('select')), and I want if the multiselect widget is enabled or not
[12:46:42] <Nicklas``> because, I have select objects with multiselect widget instancied and others without
[12:46:56] <Eviltwin> What version of jQuery
[12:47:00] <Nicklas``> git
[12:47:53] <Eviltwin> As part of the jQuery UI Widget Factory
[12:47:57] <Eviltwin> You get a free pseudoselector
[12:48:13] <Eviltwin> I believe you can do .is(":ui-multiselect")
[12:48:15] <Eviltwin> To check
[12:48:50] <Nicklas``> I test
[12:49:02] <Nicklas``> but, it's the feature whom I need :)
[12:49:31] <Eviltwin> I thought you were trying to check if the thing you selected was a multiselect
[12:49:53] <Eviltwin> $("#foo").is(":ui-multiselect") should tell you if #foo is a multiselect
[12:54:11] <Eviltwin> Nicklas``: Is that not what you want?
[12:59:39] <Nicklas``> Eviltwin: for the moment, I have the error : uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: ui-multiselect
[13:01:13] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/FfnM5/
[13:01:54] <Eviltwin> Like that?
[13:02:18] <Nicklas``> Yes
[13:02:23] <Nicklas``> it's ok for this code
[13:06:56] <Nicklas``> Evixion: the same test, in the same condition, is ok with ui-dialog but not ui-multiselect
[13:09:25] <abjorn> :o
[13:18:27] <dizzyone> I'm trying to find a way to see if something is a parent of something and have it return true or false
[13:18:42] <dizzyone> I can't find an easy way, right now I'm trying to use parentsUntil()
[13:18:52] <dizzyone> anyone know?
[13:20:54] <systemfault> What's that?
[13:22:15] <dizzyone> I'm doing it like this
[13:22:15] <dizzyone> Boolean($(event.target).parentsUntil($('subNav'), '.subNav').length)
[13:22:23] <dizzyone> but it feels wrong
[13:24:49] <dizzyone> pretty sure that's retarded >_>
[13:25:04] <dizzyone> tryiing to restrict bubbling with that
[13:37:26] <stakhanov> alert($("#parent > #child").length); RETURNS 1 if #parent is parent of #child, else 0... maybe?
[13:37:49] <stakhanov> You could tweak it to return boolean true/false.
[13:39:56] <stakhanov> return ( $("#parent > #child").length > 0 ) ? true : false;
[13:50:37] <Eviltwin> dizzyone: You're trying to see if a particular element is an ancestor of the event target?
[13:57:37] <shesek> stakhanov, ( $("#parent > #child").length > 0 ) would do the same
[13:57:49] <shesek> no need for the `? true : false` but
[13:57:53] <shesek> ~ bit
[13:58:02] <shesek> * bit
[13:58:05] <shesek> or simply !!$("#parent > #child").length
[14:12:42] <stakhanov> :)
[14:17:09] <amites> Could anyone point me towards how to debug some strange behavior in a .load -- blanks the DOM (including firebug) and replaces with the html being called -- http://solarpanelhost.org/garden/colorado
[14:20:43] <amites> Seems to work that way frequently -- figure something out as soon as you type it out asking for help -- reason for the behavior still seems rather off though (was a server side permissions issue)
[14:21:28] <Eviltwin> amites: Can you reproduce the specific issue at jsFiddle.net?
[14:22:19] <stakhanov> amites: which part of the web page you want to inject into your page?
[14:35:10] <amites> Eviltwin: difficult to say -- leaning towards HTML being malformed when generated with the permissions issues I was having, saved a version in the repo and will go back and tinker again to figure out why it was happening
[14:35:19] <sphinxxx> can anyone explain the $.param  part to me  with jquery BBQ:  http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/hash-history-jquery-bbq.html
[14:35:38] <amites> stakhanov: the page is set to render only the snippet I want to pull when called from an AJAX query
[14:36:42] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: What about it?
[14:38:13] <sphinxxx> i've got the hash history working, but isotope isn't
[14:38:32] <stakhanov> amites: Perhaps you should consider $.ajax() to request the page, manipulating it (grabbing just the snippet you want) and then injecting it into your page.
[14:38:48] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: Did you see ?.param
[14:38:48] <bot-t> sphinxxx, jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[14:39:19] <stakhanov> Perhaps you are having a problem specifying the 'snippet' in you .load() parameters, thereby loading unwanted content.
[14:40:25] <sphinxxx> eviltwin, where do i put it in the code?
[14:41:04] <sphinxxx> ill make a fiddle
[14:41:37] <Eviltwin> K
[14:43:29] <sphinxxx> http://jsfiddle.net/28ZHT/
[14:43:39] <sphinxxx> i'm tryign to figure out where i use the $.param  in that code
[14:44:04] <sphinxxx> ahh, the script includes are local, sry, lol
[14:44:11] <Eviltwin> Oh, I don't think you do use $.param
[14:44:25] <Eviltwin> I think they're just suggesting you encode it that way in the <a> href
[14:44:33] <Eviltwin> Then use $.deparam to parse it
[14:44:41] <sphinxxx> oh
[14:44:53] <sphinxxx> if the backend is rails, there'd be an equivalent function to encode it?
[14:45:08] <Eviltwin> I believe so
[14:45:42] <Eviltwin> If not, it's not difficult to make
[14:45:54] <Eviltwin> Assuming you have an encodeURIComponent-equivalent
[14:46:25] <Eviltwin> Alternatively, you could probably do someting using JSON instead

[15:29:57] <Eviltwin> patabugen: Can you create a jsFiddle with what you have so far?
[15:30:03] <Eviltwin> ?jsfiddle @ patabugen
[15:30:03] <bot-t> patabugen, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.

[15:32:24] <Engin> I know this is a bit awkward but... I'm calling .focus() on an element to trigger the event, can I temporarily disable .focus() handlers ?
[15:32:58] <Engin> i.e. if .focus() is not caused by user interaction and triggered programatically, handlers shouldn't be called

[15:55:50] <Agbeladem> Can I force an iframe to scroll to the top ?
[15:56:34] <Agbeladem> I tried scrollTop but it doesn't seem to be working
[16:01:54] <stakhanov> whoever: What is the CSS property of .class that makes it visible (or otherwise hidden)? Maybe try find(".class:not(:hidden))?
[16:02:35] <Agbeladem> what do you mean ? It's usually display: none; or visibility:hidden;
[16:06:32] <stakhanov> visibility:hidden does not seem to work, I think... http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[16:06:50] <stakhanov> "Elements with visibility: hidden or opacity: 0 are considered to be visible"
[16:06:59] <Agbeladem> okay, then ?
[16:07:35] <stakhanov> So how are the 'hidden' elements in your class being hidden?
[16:07:47] <stakhanov> I guess using display:none?
[16:08:13] <solidus-river> how do i filter for a textarea that does not have a certain class
[16:08:16] <solidus-river> so all text areas without this class
[16:08:39] <solidus-river> $('textarea.?');
[16:08:53] <Agbeladem> :not()
[16:09:23] <solidus-river> $('textarea:not(.myclass)');
[16:09:51] <Agbeladem> yeah
[16:10:12] <whoever> need some assistance returning elemenst in the claSs that are visible.. this just returns object   alert($(".toggleSubDiv:visible[id*]"));
[16:10:22] <whoever> what am i missing
[16:10:55] <Agbeladem> .get()
[16:11:01] <Agbeladem> this is a jquery object
[16:11:42] <nicholasschulz> What do you think of the effect when clicking "Next step" ? Notice the green dot fading in and the button fading out. Is it an ok effect or should I "illustrate" when the user moves on in a different way? http://annenetasje.com/area21/testdrive.php Go to the "sell" page.
[16:12:03] <whoever> Agbeladem: Thx now befor class or id
[16:12:26] <Agbeladem> whoever: what do you want exactly.
[16:14:03] <Agbeladem> $(".toggleSubDiv:visible[id*]").function() { alert($(this).attr('id')); }
[16:15:20] <k0rnel_> hi. how can I remove css class with :focus? but, just that :focus definition. I have some jquery fallback for css background-position transition on textarea element. but when I focus it, it will do the css .textarea:focus part at first, so the background disapear. and on next focus it will work ok http://pastebin.com/GNNPTbdN
[16:15:39] <k0rnel_> and when I remove .textarea:focus from css, it works ok
[16:15:59] <k0rnel_> so I need somehow to remove that on focusin event
[16:16:38] <k0rnel_> and there is a mistake, .removeClass("textarea"); dont suppose to be there
[16:17:10] <k0rnel_> here is correct version http://pastebin.com/pWZEwXaw
[16:20:40] <felipe_Brz> this button is still sending the form even if the input is blank... can anyone spot a mistake? http://pastie.org/3145878
[16:29:10] <whoever> Agbeladem: when i try to alert($(this).attr("id"));   i get unidentified
[16:29:36] <Agbeladem> then it means no id was given to element... so ?
[16:31:52] <whoever> Agbeladem: but i copied the function you posted and no alert so i trid what i just posted on another select
[16:35:14] <coldhead> felipe_Brz: i would bind to the form's submit event, rather than the button's click event
[16:35:22] <Agbeladem> whoever: then your selector is wrong
[16:35:28] <Eviltwin> What's up?
[16:35:33] <salvo> ciao
[16:54:51] <whoever> i used jquery to add options to my select with values but when i try to alert text() or val() on change i get a blank alert but i can only seem to get the value with $(#id option:selected).text() . any idea

[18:55:09] <felixp> how can i debug that?
[18:56:35] <Eviltwin> felixp: Set a breakpoint every place you bind a click listener and set your browser to break on click events
[18:56:42] <Eviltwin> felixp: fixingthesejquery.com
[18:56:54] <Eviltwin> Walks you through the basics
[19:01:20] <felixp> Eviltwin: i already did set the breakpoints, but i don't know what's calling it...
[19:01:22] <felixp> thank's
[19:01:34] <Eviltwin> It should show you the stacktrace
[19:02:47] <Eviltwin> Does it not?
[19:02:50] <Eviltwin> Which debugger are you using?
[19:03:58] <kggle_> hey any idea, i have a page, if i call it the jquery plugin nivo slider dont work (on subpage it does), if i call via browser the script on path and go back via browser back, the script runs, on reload it doenst work. any idea?
[19:04:20] <Eviltwin> kggle_: fixingthesejquery.com
[19:04:27] <Eviltwin> Read through that
[19:04:31] <felixp> Chrome webkit
[19:05:16] <Eviltwin> felixp: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide12
[19:05:22] <Eviltwin> See on the top right
[19:05:24] <Eviltwin> "Call Stack"
[19:05:26] <kggle_> Eviltwin, maybe wrong mention? :)
[19:05:57] <Eviltwin> kggle_: In those slides it explains common problems
[19:06:04] <Eviltwin> Thigns like $ not wokring
[19:06:06] <Eviltwin> working*
[19:06:57] <kggle_> its pretty weired, because in one browser it works, it outputs no errors in all consoles. but ok
[19:09:25] <merlin1991> I'm currently banging my head against a wall
[19:09:49] <merlin1991> I'm using jqueryui to use some tabs, in a special case I have to destroy the tabs widget and recrate it from scratch
[19:09:50] <Eviltwin> merlin1991: On?
[19:10:00] <Eviltwin> K
[19:10:07] <merlin1991> but calling $('#someid').tabs('destroy') does nothing
[19:10:20] <someish> anyone know of a solid jquery image annotation plugin? i've done a lot of google searching and everything seems to have been abandoned.
[19:10:24] * merlin1991 headdesks
[19:10:33] <merlin1991> been calling .tabs on the wrong id :$
[19:10:39] <Eviltwin> Yup
[19:11:07] <merlin1991> sometimes it just helps writing out the question :D I was about to write where #someid is the ul of the tab container which is wrong :D
[19:12:41] <merlin1991> okay time to preselect a proper tab on start now
[19:16:11] <merlin1991> another question, this time for real though, when I use jquery ui to create a button, to which click handler do I have to bind to get the buttonpress?
[19:18:05] <Patabugen> Hey Eviltwin, Did you get a chance to take a look at the jsfiddle about hovering hoverings perchance? http://jsfiddle.net/tNZWq/3/
[19:19:09] <cuppsy> Patabugen: I'm guessing you didn't see my response a while back?
[19:19:21] <solidus-river> anyone here know coffeescript well?
[19:20:57] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: I don't care for it
[19:21:04] <cuppsy> Patabugen: I use this for image hovering and it seems to work well: http://pastebin.com/kZRda7xW
[19:21:11] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: i think it has some practical limitations i just ran into
[19:21:18] <Eviltwin> Patabugen: What's flashing about it?
[19:21:18] <cuppsy> Patabugen: Obviously don't change the offset on mousemove, but I think that could work for you.
[19:21:29] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: for example, i cant seem to use the skillet paradigm with it, http://www.pastie.org/private/b8bvjvhkumvywbng4js2a
[19:21:44] <cuppsy> Check http://www.smokingtickets.com/performer-events/coldplay-tickets/ for an example where that jQuery is used (performer image). No flicker there.
[19:22:42] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: Is that actually a problem?
[19:23:06] <Eviltwin> I have a lot of disagreements with what CoffeeScript does
[19:23:14] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: well, i could just not use coffee-script, but yes, it breaks the arguments to an anonymous self executing function
[19:24:52] <Eviltwin> Patabugen: I would do this: http://jsfiddle.net/tNZWq/7/
[19:29:02] <Patabugen> cuppsy I'm afraid I didn't, I'm looking now!
[19:29:40] <Patabugen> Eviltwin when you put the mouse over the div it puts the Delete button in place, when you mouse out it hides it. But when you put the mouse onto the delete button it mouse-outs of the div and hides it - which mouse-ons so it comes back
[19:30:06] <Krinkle> patabugen: No need for any js for that
[19:30:19] <felixp> Eviltwin: i tried to debug it that way but no clue...
[19:30:42] <Patabugen> Krinkle it's not a rollover, it's a delete button
[19:31:06] <Krinkle> patabugen: I know that, Im saying you don't need js to hide/show it
[19:31:13] <Krinkle> http://jsfiddle.net/tNZWq/8/
[19:31:28] <Krinkle> to actually trigger an action, sure.
[19:32:29] <Patabugen> Ah I see, so then I use mousemove and know the co-ordinates of the 'button'?
[19:32:40] <felixp> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZsHZ/
[19:32:46] <Krinkle> patabugen: Why would you need any coordinates ?
[19:33:04] <Krinkle> $('.delete').click(function(e){ /* do your delete stuff */ });
[19:33:05] <Patabugen> Because clicking on the item itself is to edit it, but to click on the button is to delete it
[19:33:28] <Krinkle> patabugen: okay, there is stopPropagation for that
[19:34:12] <Spuddy> Hi, does anyone know why my .click won't work in FF? Other .clicks on the page work fine in FF but not this one: http://pastie.org/3146507
[19:34:20] <Patabugen> ahhhh now that sounds like what I was hoping for!
[19:34:26] <Patabugen> Thank you :) I'll take a look
[19:34:39] <felixp> Eviltwin: When i click a button, it triggers: jQuery("#imgTaskbarBlock1").openWidget({id: 1, actionPath: "/the/path/for/closed"})
[19:34:51] <Krinkle> patabugen: $('.delete').click( function( e ) { e.stopPropagation(); var id = $(this).parent().data( 'item-id' ); myLib.doDelete( id ); });
[19:34:53] <Krinkle> something like that
[19:35:13] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ felixp
[19:35:13] <bot-t> felixp, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[19:35:18] <Krinkle> e.stopPropagation will stop the click-event from going up the document element tree
[19:35:41] <Eviltwin> Spuddy: I suggest you use .delegate instead of .live
[19:35:55] <Spuddy> Oh? Let me try that. I'm new to this.
[19:36:05] <Krinkle> Or upgrade to 1.7 and use .on() so you don't have to think about delegate/live
[19:36:16] <Eviltwin> Spuddy: .live is deprecated
[19:36:24] <Spuddy> Ah...hm. Let's see.
[19:36:36] <Patabugen> Krinkle it's the hover which is the problem, not the click
[19:36:43] <Krinkle> Eviltwin: So is .delegate, right ?
[19:36:49] <Krinkle> patabugen: okay :)
[19:36:50] <timwis> coldhead: Working well :) http://68.63.108.216/redditgal
[19:37:07] <Eviltwin> Krinkle: No .delegate isn't deprecated
[19:37:09] <Krinkle> patabugen: I act on what is shown in the jsfiddle
[19:37:11] <Spuddy> Eviltwin: It doesn't work in FF, and now in Chrome either.
[19:37:23] <Eviltwin> Krinkle: But it's been superseded by .on
[19:37:23] <Krinkle> Eviltwin: Well, it practice it should be. Simply use .on()
[19:37:25] <Spuddy> But .live worked in Chrome.
[19:37:31] <Krinkle> Eviltwin: right
[19:37:38] <Eviltwin> Krinkle: Why would .delegate be deprecated?
[19:37:45] <Eviltwin> It's just a different order of arguments for .on
[19:38:07] <coldhead> woah cool split freenode
[19:38:13] <felixp> Eviltwin: i updated the code there with less stuff. i just want to know why there is 3-4 ajax calls when i click the close button...
[19:38:43] <Krinkle> Eviltwin: Well not formally deprecated, but since all it does is return this.on( … );.., it's better not to use it for clarity sake
[19:38:52] <Patabugen> Krinkle the js fiddle only has a hover (My one at least, there's been some updates http://jsfiddle.net/tNZWq/3/ )
[19:39:16] <Spuddy> So now after changing .live to delegate it stopped working in Chrome as well...
[19:40:03] <Krinkle> Spuddy: Did you just replace "live" with "delegate" or actually switched to the format that $.fn.delegate needs ? they're not interchangeable, delegate has a slightly different syntax.
[19:40:21] <Spuddy> Oh...I just changed it. Like I said, I'm new. Hmm.
[19:40:32] <Krinkle> patabugen: I assume click that delete button will delete a different item depending on where it is clicked, correct ?
[19:40:33] <Eviltwin> Spuddy: see ?.delegate
[19:40:34] <bot-t> Spuddy, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[19:40:37] <Eviltwin> Read that page
[19:40:48] <Spuddy> Ok.
[19:40:54] <Krinkle> patabugen: So probably better and easier to maintain to have one for each item, not one that is being morphed into where you need it.
[19:41:17] <Patabugen> That'll still leave me with the same hover problem though
[19:41:34] <Patabugen> Because putting the mouse onto the button counts as taking it off the div, so the button gets hidden
[19:41:38] <Krinkle> patabugen: If by hover problem you mean flikkr, that should be fixed in http://jsfiddle.net/tNZWq/8/
[19:41:50] <Krinkle> as that doesn't use any of those techiniques
[19:41:51] <Krinkle> c
[19:41:59] <Krinkle> css is build for this scenario
[19:42:50] <coldhead> shameless kiss of vanity
[19:43:18] <Patabugen> Hmm I'll have a play, but it's not a bad idea
[19:44:10] <CrazyZurfer> hello, i have a design related question Xd
[19:44:18] <CrazyZurfer> i've a background image
[19:44:36] <CrazyZurfer> and I want to use just a little bit of it and use it as a bacround
[19:44:40] <CrazyZurfer> background*
[19:44:43] <CrazyZurfer> and repeat it
[19:44:48] <CrazyZurfer> in X
[19:44:56] <Eviltwin> CrazyZurfer: Don't believe you can
[19:45:24] <CrazyZurfer> you think It's not possible? :S
[19:45:33] <Eviltwin> Correct
[19:45:42] <CrazyZurfer> :(
[19:45:47] <Eviltwin> I mean...it's kind of a weird use case
[19:46:48] <CrazyZurfer> xD
[19:46:50] <CrazyZurfer> ok
[19:46:58] <CrazyZurfer> so i've to cut the image and then use it?
[19:47:04] <Eviltwin> Yes
[19:47:25] <CrazyZurfer> I've seen that some people do something like this
[19:47:26] <CrazyZurfer> background: url("top50indie-player.png") -8px -31px no-repeat;
[19:47:41] <CrazyZurfer> and then use width:31px; height: 31px;
[19:47:57] <CrazyZurfer> but if I do that, I can't repeat it xD
[19:48:11] <Krinkle> patabugen: here, http://jsfiddle.net/tNZWq/10/ had some extra time :)
[19:48:12] <Patabugen> It's the repeating it bit which gives you the problem
[19:48:54] <Spuddy> So I've got this now, but it's back to working in Chrome and not FF: http://pastie.org/3146575
[19:48:54] <Patabugen> Thanks Krinkle, the problem I'm finding is that if there's content in that corner, it's affected
[19:48:56] <Patabugen> such as in http://jsfiddle.net/tNZWq/9/
[19:49:04] <Eviltwin> CrazyZurfer: Exactly
[19:49:18] <Eviltwin> If you want to use a piece of it once, you can do it that way
[19:49:19] <Krinkle> patabugen: Will, in a real application you probably will have a more solid layout, right ? Not all text grunted into the corner
[19:49:22] <Eviltwin> You can't repeat it that way
[19:49:56] <Patabugen> The first line might reach the end of the box
[19:50:08] <CrazyZurfer> Eviltwin, one last thing :)
[19:50:24] <CrazyZurfer> how is that you write to me with out going to another window?
[19:50:36] <Eviltwin> What?
[19:50:41] <CrazyZurfer> like "Eviltwin: something"
[19:50:51] <Spuddy> Krinkle: I've gotten delegate working in Chrome, but just like with live, not with FF.
[19:50:58] <Eviltwin> I type "CrazyZurfer: " then your name
[19:51:01] <Eviltwin> That is how I do it
[19:51:02] <CrazyZurfer> ah
[19:51:36] <Krinkle> patabugen: So, where is the real layout ?
[19:51:39] <CrazyZurfer> yep
[19:51:57] <CrazyZurfer> Eviltwin: ok
[19:52:09] <Patabugen> It's for a CMS editor, so the content of the div could be anything the user decides to enter
[19:52:40] <CrazyZurfer> Eviltwin: Thanks for everything :)
[19:53:41] <Krinkle> patabugen: example: http://jsfiddle.net/tNZWq/11/
[19:53:45] <Krinkle> use absolute position within the box
[19:53:54] <Krinkle> position: relative; on <div class="item">
[19:54:01] <Krinkle> and position: absolute on the delete button
[19:54:18] <Krinkle> or use padding so that text is not covered
[19:54:57] <Krinkle> patabugen: with padding: http://jsfiddle.net/tNZWq/12/
[19:55:33] <Patabugen> Padding isn't an option unfortunately, but #11 appears to be fantastic
[19:55:49] <Patabugen> I didn't think you could use absolute like that, I've got a bit of reading to do ;)
[19:56:04] <Krinkle> patabugen: yep, this is all I'm giving you. Now it's your turn :)
[19:56:17] <Krinkle> Good luck on your app, gotta go now
[19:56:25] <Patabugen> Thank you hugely :)
[19:56:28] <Krinkle> You're welcome
[19:57:14] <Spuddy> Can someone help me? I was originally using .live('click' but Krinkle told me to switch to delegate, and I'm still having the same problem. It works in Chrome but not Firefox.
[19:57:21] <Spuddy> Code is: http://pastie.org/3146575
[19:58:36] <Spuddy> And NONE of my javascript works in IE8...
[19:58:51] <coldhead> ?jshint @ Spuddy
[19:58:51] <bot-t> Spuddy, http://jshint.com/
[19:58:57] <coldhead> drop it in there
[20:01:48] <Spuddy> coldhead: No JavaScript errors or warnings...:|
[20:03:19] <thepro4ever> if i set cache: true; for one ajax call is the browser going to cache all my other ajax calls??
[20:09:58] <Matiasu> Hello
[20:10:12] <Matiasu> how do you select a div that has more than one class?
[20:12:39] <svcghost> select it by id
[20:12:41] <svcghost> not class
[20:13:02] <Matiasu> it's not my page, I can't add an id
[20:13:06] <Spuddy> Gosh this is frustrating...
[20:13:39] <Matiasu> http://api.jquery.com/class-selector/ says I can do $('.class1.class2') but it doesn't work for me :|
[20:14:03] <Spuddy> Matiasu: I think it's $('.class1 .class2') the space being important.
[20:14:15] <Matiasu> no, it doesn't work neither
[20:14:49] <Matiasu> <script>$(".myclass.otherclass").css("border","13px solid red");</script> <-- from jquery.com
[20:15:09] <Spuddy> You need $(document).ready
[20:15:14] <Spuddy> I think?
[20:15:30] <Matiasu> no, it's already loaded :|
[20:15:55] <Spuddy> I dunno then.
[20:24:23] <cornfeed> can i do this? will it work?  input[id^=""].class
[20:24:39] <cornfeed> $('input[id^=""].class').....
[20:26:58] <becom33> Hi I need to add a index page wich has two buttons to a coparate website and a shopping cart . I was thinking use JQuery to animate the buttons . but still wondering what do we call that type of pages
[20:27:44] <becom33> anyone?
[20:29:36] <thepro4ever> if i set cache: true; for one ajax call is the browser going to cache all my other ajax calls??
[20:30:20] <standoo> can i use closure with jquery?
[20:33:05] <bob_dole> standoo: you mean clojure?
[20:33:09] <bob_dole> or closure
[20:33:13] <standoo> closure
[20:33:25] <standoo> google closure tools
[20:33:40] <merlin1991> whenever I touch the float css property I run into a wall, this time I'm about to create a 2 column layout where I want the left column autosized and the right one just next to it, HOW?
[20:34:50] <bob_dole> standoo: hmm i don't see why not, but i've never done it..
[20:35:10] <bob_dole> mostly because I think closure is the satan's spawn :(
[20:36:22] <coldhead> isn't jquery.min.js created by closure?
[20:37:29] <coldhead> oh, they use uglify now
[20:38:06] <standoo> bob_dole: why so?
[20:38:35] <becom33> I guess nobody knows =/
[20:39:10] <bob_dole> standoo: it was made by people with PHDs that never bothered learning javascript but were forced to write it, so obviously they hated it and came out with this we-tarded tool
[20:39:54] <bob_dole> well, i have nothing MUCH against the tools, its the compile from Java to javascript that offends me
[20:39:56] <coldhead> becom33: this probably isn't what you mean but are you talking about a landing page?
[20:40:24] <coldhead> becom33: this probably isn't what you mean but are you talking about a landing page?
[20:41:41] <becom33> coldhead: whats a landing page ?
[20:43:08] <becom33> no I dont think . well I have a cart and a corp website. I need a put a main page which with two buttons which gives a user to choose which site they wants to
[20:43:11] <becom33> coldhead:
[20:44:22] <coldhead> a landing page sort of means a page you can land on, and then choose where you want to go to
[20:44:42] <coldhead> some sites have a landing page where you can pick whih language you want to browse the site in
[20:44:52] <coldhead> but you may mean something else, it's my first day using jquery
[20:44:53] <coldhead> sorry
[20:45:17] <becom33> coldhead:  its not a question on JQuery =/ . but thanks
[20:45:20] <snover> not sorry enough
[20:45:21] <coldhead> snover is the guy who moved jQuery away from closure, standoo
[20:45:30] <coldhead> so ask him about everything
[20:45:48] <snover> it’s way too fucking slow and doesn’t work as well as uglify. the end!
[20:46:01] <standoo> snover: that answer's my question
[20:46:08] <standoo> snover: thank you.
[20:52:05] <innociv> How do I figure out what called a function?  Like a stack trace.
[20:55:00] <dizzyone> Who doesn't love a good old marquee
[20:55:07] <dizzyone> marquee tag for president 2012
[20:57:12] <merlin1991> anybody know why I can't bind data with .data('somename', 'somevalue') to tr elements?
[21:00:40] <innociv> Well. I put a console log at every place this function is being called
[21:00:43] <innociv> and there is no console log.
[21:00:49] <innociv> I can't figure out what is calling it.
[21:04:04] <innociv> Anyone? This is becoming depressing :|
[21:04:08] <TahitiPetey> innociv: console.trace()
[21:04:18] <innociv> What do I put in there?
[21:04:36] <TahitiPetey> .....
[21:04:42] <TahitiPetey> Didn't you say you wanted a stack trace?
[21:04:49] <TahitiPetey> Put it where you want your script to print the stack trace.
[21:06:00] <innociv> Oh it takes no args.
[21:08:20] <innociv> Doesn't help. :|  This is so stupid. Hang on...
[21:08:43] <TahitiPetey> Why don't you pastie your code somewhere so others can potentially help you debug?
[21:14:01] <innociv> Well, trying to make an example and it's telling me missing ) when I see no such issue. http://jsfiddle.net/672W5/2/
[21:14:33] <innociv> And it's hard to narrow down hundreds of lines of code to boil it down to what the issue is here.
[21:14:50] <innociv> I'm 90% sure I won't be able to, but lets see.
[21:16:47] <SlexAxton> innociv: Topic = Row.inherit(function(args) {
[21:17:03] <innociv> Ah oops
[21:17:16] <SlexAxton> what debugger are you using?
[21:17:22] <SlexAxton> because chrome told me that instantly
[21:18:18] <innociv> firebug. I just wasn't looking up enough.
[21:28:40] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/N8BWt/ Yeah. Nope. Works perfectly fine here. :/
[21:29:22] <innociv> writePost() is getting called instead of sendChatMessage() even when I remove ever writePost() call from every bit of my code. :|
[21:31:29] <innociv> rofl oops
[21:31:31] <innociv> Found it.
[21:32:30] <innociv> I have this function to extend other functions, and had that one extending the other.
[21:33:42] <coldhead> good work innociv!
[21:33:54] <innociv> Thanks.
[21:33:56] <coldhead> i will link you to this anyway, it's how i would debug something like that: http://jsfiddle.net/DXRRX/
[21:34:41] <innociv> That didn't work in this case.
[21:34:50] <innociv> Or maybe I wasn't looking in the trace close enough
[21:34:59] <innociv> to see it calling the extend wrong or something.
[21:35:19] <coldhead> right, that thing won't work if your function is in a different closure
[21:35:30] <coldhead> it's all very gomblicated
[21:35:34] <coldhead> but you have triumphed!
[21:38:26] <innociv> I was searching code for writePost() (man times) when there is no () after it with extend. :x
[22:02:44] <cornfeed> ok i have a good one...http://jsfiddle.net/5WDzg/   i am trying to rename all elements inside $(this) to a new number

[22:20:41] <cornfeed> does anyone know if i can use $(this > "").foobar();  ??
[22:21:00] <cornfeed> will child selectors work with this?
[22:23:28] <coldhead> no

[22:35:05] <cornfeed> any ideas best way to replace the number in this string with a pre-set variable?  _wpjsp[4][arrowhover]   just want to replace any number with "var id"
[22:35:43] <cornfeed> the variable "id"**
[22:37:30] <coldhead> cornfeed: http://jsfiddle.net/CGRhB/
[22:37:45] <cornfeed> thx
[22:45:51] <cornfeed> ok actually i have a differeny approach. what would be the best way to trim everything up to the last set of brackets   String="_wpjsp[4][blah]"  Want="[blah]"?
[22:47:09] <cornfeed> replace(/^\s*\[|\]\s*$/g, '')?
[22:50:56] <cornfeed> ah ha! replace(/^_[a-z]*\[[0-9]*\]/g, '')
[22:53:28] <coldhead> ?eval '[bunch][of][blah]'.replace(/\]/g, '').split(/\[/).pop();
[22:53:41] <coldhead> oh, thanks for nothing bot-t
[22:54:58] <Web> Hey guys, im using queryloader plugin but i cant get it to load i get an error queryloader is not defined
[22:55:10] <Web> How to fix this? i have included the js file the plugin developers provide
[23:03:42] <JohnLe> cornfeed: do you need to use regex?
[23:03:53] <eggnogg> I'm having an issue where the window resize() event isnt triggering in IE in version 1.7.1
[23:04:13] <eggnogg> tested on IE9
[23:04:15] <JohnLe> for finding the trailing [blah] part?
[23:05:34] <cornfeed> JohnLe: figured it out
[23:05:38] <JohnLe> k
[23:05:46] <cornfeed> thanks though :-D
[23:05:56] <JohnLe> finding the last [ and trimming seemed more straight forward
[23:06:28] <cornfeed> i just needed to adjust my regex understand. JS a bit different than bash
[23:06:39] <JohnLe> ah
[23:06:41] <JohnLe> gotcha
[23:07:28] <cornfeed> who ever thought of regex. genious!
[23:07:38] <JohnLe> indeed
[23:07:43] <cornfeed> genius** :-P
[23:10:01] <coldhead> i think it was henry spence
[23:10:18] <Web> somebody help?
[23:10:23] <coldhead> writing a FSM to process regular expressions is better than sex in many ways
[23:10:29] <coldhead> or so i assume
[23:10:39] <Web> im having this error in firefox error console Error: QueryLoader is not defined
[23:10:39] <Web> Source File: http://localhost/bb/forum.php
[23:10:39] <Web> Line: 22
[23:10:56] <coldhead> we can't access your localhost, Web
[23:11:11] <Web> umm, u want ip?
[23:11:16] <coldhead> whatever works
[23:11:26] <Web> ok
[23:11:34] <coldhead> my guess is you aren't including the file correctly
[23:11:35] <Web> http://117.207.236.7/bb/forum.php
[23:11:42] <coldhead> it might be a 404
[23:11:44] <Web> i did this in head <script type='text/javascript' src='includes/queryLoader/js/queryLoader.js'></script>
[23:11:57] <coldhead> that IP doesn't work for me
[23:12:23] <Web> try now
[23:12:31] <coldhead> Web: do you maybe need / at the front of the src?
[23:12:35] <coldhead> /includes/ ?
[23:13:00] <coldhead> without it you are probably loading bb/includes/whatever
[23:13:06] <coldhead> which may not be correct
[23:13:49] <Web> ok added the /
[23:13:56] <coldhead> still no good?
[23:14:09] <Web> no
[23:14:26] <coldhead> can you verify in your debugger that the file is loading?
[23:14:33] <coldhead> check in the network panel
[23:14:51] <Web> firebug will do?
[23:15:06] <coldhead> sure
[23:15:50] <Web> hmm, it does not show the queryloader
[23:16:16] <coldhead> that may be part of the problem!
[23:16:43] <Web> i wonder why though, cos ive given the right path
[23:20:14] <Web> coldhead, i put the code above the jquery script
[23:20:16] <Web> and it worked
[23:20:17] <Web> o.O
[23:31:19] <cornfeed> coldhead: you seem to be quite with it. i bet this is going to get sloppy, so please don't judge me. if you have a second, maybe you can tell me why when i comment out https://github.com/cornfeed/WP-jScrollPane/blob/Version2/js/admin.js#L81 the table i clicked gets .remove()ed  but with it, table i clicked and everyone after it gets removed
[23:32:11] <cornfeed> OH I GET IT
[23:32:23] * cornfeed *facepalm*
[23:32:26] <GoddeR> :)
[23:32:34] <cornfeed> but i have no clue how to fix it .... :-/
[23:33:05] <cornfeed> it loops, renames, loops again and the deletes it because it maches the query... :-/
[23:34:41] <coldhead> good work everyone!
[23:34:52] <coldhead> glad i could halp
[23:35:54] <cornfeed> you have been very helpful, sleep well!~
[23:37:42] <Web> coldhead, dude
[23:38:04] <GoddeR> Hello I have a flickering problem in FF9, using jQuery animate on a div containing a flash object that's overlaying another div with a flash object
[23:38:09] <GoddeR> http://pastebin.com/ynczA7zD
[23:38:23] <GoddeR> that shows how I am doing the animation and all css applied
[23:38:48] <GoddeR> If anyone could I help it would be greatly appreciated, if you need more info let me know..
[23:42:39] <coldhead> Web: you said you fixed your problem!
[23:43:22] <cornfeed> lol
[23:44:00] <coldhead> GoddeR: i would fix that by telling the client it can't be done
[23:44:06] <coldhead> flash on flash is crazy
[23:44:11] <coldhead> i am not that brave
[23:45:00] <solidus-river> whats the motivation behind the change from live to on?
[23:46:11] <coldhead> simplifying bind/delegate/live into a single interface
[23:46:43] <GoddeR> http://elidoruiz.com/pagepush.html
[23:46:45] <solidus-river> oh, but theres no speed improvement?
[23:46:56] <GoddeR> that is an example of the issue
[23:47:28] <coldhead> i haven't compared, solidus-river, but it shouldn't be any slower
[23:47:31] <GoddeR> I believe it can be done, the effect is simple
[23:48:36] <solidus-river> coldhead: so if i had $(selector).live(event, function());, it should go to $(window.document).on(event, selector, function());
[23:48:37] <GoddeR> its fine on all browsers expect ff.. only test of ff9
[23:48:42] <coldhead> solidus-river: it's faster than live because you can provide a target, so not everything gets bound to document
[23:48:59] <solidus-river> coldhead: yeah, but if i wanted the exact equivalent for now
[23:49:10] <coldhead> that should work, solidus-river, but if you can be more specific than window.document that's a good thing
[23:49:24] <ziggles> is $("#my-input").blur(); the correct way to remove the user's cursor from an input?  I'm trying to get a cleared input's placeholder text to reappear after i've cleared the input's value (via the placeholder attribute)
[23:49:26] <coldhead> if you want it exactly the same you can still use live :)
[23:49:33] * coldhead still uses live
[23:49:39] <solidus-river> coldhead: can i specify multiple specific dom elements such as $('.someclass, .someotherclass')
[23:49:54] <coldhead> ziggles: you need $('#my-input')[0].blur()
[23:50:08] <coldhead> to run the native blur on the element, not the jQuery function
[23:50:14] <coldhead> solidus-river: sure you can!
[23:50:20] <coldhead> it would suck if you couldn't
[23:50:40] <ziggles> coldhead: oh wow thank you.  What is the reason for the index 0 ?
[23:50:55] <coldhead> that lets you access the actual element, ziggles
[23:51:03] <coldhead> not the jquery wrapped set that contains the elemtn
[23:51:06] <ziggles> coldhead: ahhh... not the wrapped version
[23:51:07] <coldhead> which is what you have without it
[23:51:11] <ziggles> coldhead: got ya. thanks!
[23:52:02] <coldhead> ziggles: this does the same thing: http://api.jquery.com/get/
[23:52:06] <coldhead> if you prefer that style
[23:52:33] <ziggles> coldhead: thanks 2x
[23:52:40] <coldhead> you are welcome
[23:55:07] <GoddeR> Hello, I am experencing an issue in FF9 where when I use jQuery Animate to change the opacity of a div it flickers. The div contains a flash object, which is overlayed on top of another div which contains a flash object. Let me know if you need any more information. Any help would be appreciated.
