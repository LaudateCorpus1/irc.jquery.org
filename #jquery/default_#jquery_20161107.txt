[00:55:00] <||JD||> hey, how do you match elements that have some specific css attribute?
[01:39:13] <hollabackatcha> i'm changing html with .text(), but i have a problem.. that it replaces everything in selected element. is there a way to "exclude" parts of what needs to be replaced, without changing html structure and complicating things much ? https://bpaste.net/show/bb19aadc7358
[01:40:37] <hollabackatcha> i could hardcode it, but that would defeat the purpose.. i want to leave html out of js
[02:04:12] <Cork> hollabackatcha: no, you can't replace just parts of the content in an element
[02:04:31] <Cork> hollabackatcha: the best option is to wrap the second text part in a span
[02:04:56] <Cork> hollabackatcha: or alternatively you can just move the <strong> element out of the spans
[02:05:25] <hollabackatcha> ok
[02:26:29] <DreamStuffed> Cork: heya sifoo..snail here. I have this https://jsfiddle.net/9c1a5bfv/6/ which works. And i have this http://pastebin.com/r5srB8G5 which doesnt. what am i doing wrong here
[02:29:41] <Cork> DreamStuffed: you need $(function() {}) wrap the selector ($('#demo'))
[02:29:49] <Cork> else it will run before body exists
[02:29:57] <Cork> DreamStuffed: jsfiddle does this by default
[02:30:11] <Cork> (well not exactly, but the same effect)
[02:36:01] <DreamStuffed> Cork: youre trynna say document ready?
[02:36:11] <Cork> no
[02:36:28] <Cork> DreamStuffed: $(document).ready() is depricated in jquery 3.1
[02:36:45] <Cork> so use the alternative (supported for ever) alternative $(function() {})
[02:41:39] <DreamStuffed> Cork: nothing happens ma man
[02:41:59] <DreamStuffed> try wrapping demo, tried wrapping the whole cript nada
[02:42:31] <Cork> DreamStuffed: https://jsfiddle.net/9c1a5bfv/7/
[02:42:41] <Cork> also don't forget you need to load jquery
[02:43:33] <DreamStuffed> jquery-1.7.1.min.js <--this is jquery yea?
[02:44:49] <Cork> ya, but make sure it actually loads
[02:44:59] <Cork> (check the browser console)
[02:46:07] <DreamStuffed> ...ack!
[02:46:41] <DreamStuffed> thanks cork...didnt see any errors thot it was linked.
[04:05:06] <DreamStuffed> Hi master Cork : https://jsfiddle.net/s68g0t5c/1/
[04:05:20] <DreamStuffed> trying to emulate the json
[04:05:43] <Cork> DreamStuffed: you don't need to emulate the json
[04:05:51] <Cork> if the server is configured correctly you don't need to parse it
[04:06:03] <Cork> (just make sure it sends the header Content-Type: application/json)
[04:06:55] <DreamStuffed> from the sender?
[04:07:12] <Cork> what ever generates the json
[04:07:18] <DreamStuffed> currently i couldnt adjust anything im just receiving
[04:07:35] <DreamStuffed> and server is not ready
[04:07:37] <Cork> the problem is it is sending html and you want to parse it as json
[04:08:18] <Cork> so you can't get them to fix the error?
[04:08:20] <DreamStuffed> ure saying the resukt im receiving is in html?
[04:08:26] <Cork> yes
[04:08:26] <DreamStuffed> not at the moment
[04:08:32] <Cork> it sends Content-Type: text/html
[04:08:42] <Cork> that is why you need to do JSON.parse on the response
[04:09:03] <Cork> unless that is you assuming things
[04:09:19] <Cork> data.BB should just be an object
[04:09:33] <Cork> sorry array
[04:15:58] <DreamStuffed> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/s68g0t5c/3/ so i got it error less and displaying in console correctly . But how do i then display each BBB1A, BBB2A..?
[05:01:56] <Cork> DreamStuffed: is that really the response type you're getting??
[05:02:03] <Cork> result looks REALLY weird
[05:07:18] <DreamStuffed> Cork: yeap. im gna try another way
[05:07:46] <Cork> DreamStuffed: what problem is it is double encoded (json encoded into json)
[05:08:23] <Cork> anyway to process each key, value in an object use $.each(obj, function(key, value) {});
[05:10:29] <DreamStuffed> cork: half way through another way, if i dont manage ill come back
[05:10:36] <DreamStuffed> to this one
[05:11:58] <jquery571> how to get output on html? alert works fine -- > http://jsfiddle.net/nCE9u/4255/
[05:13:47] <jquery571> oh. missed id .. had class :P
[05:35:11] <Cygn> Hi everyone, i got an element on a page, that has the class and id "test". When i select all elements with the class test using $('#test'), i get back a collection of this one element. But whenever i try to use the class selector, e.g. $('#test.test') i will get back the element 9 times in the collection... Why is that? (No other JS on the page.)
[05:35:50] <Cork> Cygn: that makes no sense
[05:35:54] <Cygn> Sorry, forget the question, while asking i recognized the error. ;)
[05:35:59] <Cork> are you sure you don't have a space between them?
[05:36:09] <Cork> (if not, could you make a jsfiddle of the problem)
[05:36:41] <Cygn> Thanks for the friendly response Cork, but i just recognized that there WERE actually multiple elements.
[05:36:44] <Cygn> Thanks anyway.
[05:37:32] <Cork> Cygn: doesn't matter, you should never EVER get more then one element if you select an id
[05:37:45] <Cork> as an id can only exist once in the page
[05:38:19] <Cygn> Cork: Yep, it should, but in this case it was existing multiple times. When i only select the id i just get one result. Id+Class returns all of em. But this is a markup error anyway.
[05:38:23] <AdamPDotty> $('#Cork').help('Cygn');
[05:38:55] <Cork> Cygn: no it still shouldn't happen unless you have a selector error
[05:40:33] <Cork> uh...
[05:41:07] <Cork> weird...
[05:41:18] <Cork> wonder how that logic works
[05:41:21] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/jh7sa81b/1/
[05:41:50] <Cork> Cygn: apparently that somehow makes a case where the browser returns multiple elements, i for the life of me can't see why
[05:44:08] <jquery006> output should be "between 10 and 12" ---> http://jsfiddle.net/nCE9u/4256/
[05:45:14] <AdamPDotty> hmm 12:0 ?
[05:46:12] <AdamPDotty> I could not parse that.
[05:47:14] <jquery006> this seems to work, but not catching minutes --> http://jsfiddle.net/nCE9u/4257/
[05:48:55] <AdamPDotty> time2 is a string, so I would expect an integer value of 0. Bet clock is not less. Let me try!
[05:51:00] <AdamPDotty> Anyway do not compare strings this way! Result would be at best confusing.
[05:52:21] <jquery006> AdamPDotty yes, like this, but it doesnt work anyway ---> http://jsfiddle.net/nCE9u/4258/
[05:53:42] <AdamPDotty> 12:0 does not make any sense
[05:53:57] <AdamPDotty> There is no :-operator in Javascript
[05:54:10] <AdamPDotty> Try http://jsfiddle.net/nCE9u/4259/
[05:54:47] <AdamPDotty> and 12/0 is still undefined
[05:55:33] <jquery006> why * 60 ? :P
[05:56:29] <jquery006> 60 is minutes now?
[05:58:38] <AdamPDotty> I heard there are 60 minutes in an hour
[05:58:42] <AdamPDotty> .
[06:23:09] <Cygn> Cork: Thanks for your input! :)
[06:51:51] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/xvKNz this is my code for post form using ajax
[06:52:47] <RonaldsM> I am confused, because my chatfunction.php headers to chat.php, that line should be deleted right?
[06:54:09] <Cork> RonaldsM: not sure what the question is
[06:54:25] <Cork> what headers are you referring to?
[06:54:30] <RonaldsM> how to load data into database without reloading page
[06:54:49] <RonaldsM> 		header('Location: chat');
[06:55:00] <RonaldsM> in my chatfunction.php
[06:55:09] <Cork> uh, that is the server response header
[06:55:20] <Cork> and location indicates a 3xx response
[06:55:32] <Cork> and those aren't visible to js
[06:56:18] <RonaldsM> so I can't write messages without loading after every submit
[06:56:36] <Cork> sure you can, you just can't use this solution
[06:57:24] <Cork> when the server sees that it is an ajax call it has to respond with the state of the change instead of the new page
[06:57:29] <Cork> (the redirect)
[06:57:36] <Cork> and a 200 status instead of a 3xx
[06:59:10] <RonaldsM> when I delete header from my php function, action happens and I am left in white page of chatfunction.php
[07:05:40] <RonaldsM> can You share ajax code that works with my solution
[07:06:00] <Cork> you would have to fix the server side
[07:06:05] <Cork> the problem isn't with the client side
[07:06:43] <RonaldsM> whats wrong with it
[07:06:53] <RonaldsM> function happens, data gets inputed
[07:07:23] <Cork> the server needs to handle that it is a script that expects response not redirects
[07:08:11] <RonaldsM> and how do I do that
[07:33:32] <d[10]> https://jsfiddle.net/7gfwhd5e/
[07:33:46] <d[10]> what wrong ?
[07:33:56] <RonaldsM> ok this is my code now
[07:33:56] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/EyH4A
[08:07:24] <RonaldsM> okay this is newest version of my code http://apaste.info/s2fdT
[08:30:59] <AdamPDotty> d[10]: https://jsfiddle.net/7gfwhd5e/7/
[08:32:39] <d10magic> AdamPDotty thanks, but $(.backMenu).removeClass("active"); $(this).addClass("active);
[08:32:40] <d10magic> :D
[08:34:25] <henk_> i'd rather do '.siblings().removeClass'
[08:34:39] <henk_> just to make sure every active elsewhere is deleted
[08:36:04] <d10magic> henk_ nice
[08:36:27] <henk_> http://codepen.io/lost-design/pen/vKgXeQ
[08:36:31] <henk_> if you want to look into it
[08:36:56] <henk_> $(".item").click(function() {
[08:36:56] <henk_> 	$(this).addClass('is-active').siblings().removeClass('is-active');
[08:36:57] <henk_> });
[08:40:22] <AdamPDotty> An improvement would be to attach the handler to the container.
[08:40:36] <henk_> or that
[09:10:09] <amanda18> can somebody help me please
[09:10:20] <amanda18> I need some advice on websites calculator on my website
[09:10:37] <amanda18> I need the form to calculate data on the fly
[09:10:42] <Cork> ash the question, and not for someone and ppl will answer if they have the question
[09:10:43] <amanda18> now have to press button calculates to do it
[09:10:57] <Cork> ash==ask
[09:11:07] <amanda18> http://www.professionalnumerology.com/freeonlinenumerologycalculator.html
[09:11:25] <amanda18> if you type in the name then press calculate you get the total vibrations of all the letters in the name
[09:11:30] <amanda18> but you need to press a button
[09:11:53] <amanda18> I want the process to be automated to calculate immediately when you type the letter and that you don't have to press the calculate button at the end
[09:12:19] <amanda18> they told me to use the JavaScript on click command but I'm lost
[09:12:25] <Cork> amanda18: just do a click on the button on input
[09:12:46] <amanda18> yes that is the problem but I don't know how to code it and where to add the code
[09:13:15] <Cork> $('input-field').on('input', function() { $('button').trigger('click') })
[09:13:31] <Cork> psudo selectors but the rest should be all you need
[09:13:46] <amanda18> thank you but I know where to put this I have the PHP file, JavaScript file, HTML file, can you tell me exactly where to put this code
[09:13:54] <amanda18> I mean I don't know
[09:14:46] <amanda18> can you see all the code for this calculator if you inspected?
[09:15:05] <amanda18> I mean if you use the inspect command
[09:15:46] <amanda18> I can give you 10 bucks if you fix it quickly via PayPal
[09:15:58] <amanda18> some beer cash
[09:19:23] <Aquazi> hey I have a stupid jquery question (new to jquery I'm following a tutorial)
[09:19:32] <Aquazi> https://code.jquery.com/
[09:19:47] <Aquazi> what is the difference between uncompressed, minified, slim and slim minified CDNs?
[09:20:39] <AdamPDotty> uncompressed = readable
[09:20:42] <Aquazi> is it just for debugging?
[09:20:51] <Aquazi> and developing?
[09:20:55] <AdamPDotty> minifed = less bytes but unreadable
[09:21:08] <AdamPDotty> do not know slim
[09:22:21] <AdamPDotty> If you want to advance jquery use uncompressed, else minified.
[09:22:45] <AdamPDotty> I would not use slim unless I know what is missing.
[09:24:54] <holycrunchitz> heelo
[09:25:00] <holycrunchitz> what's up?

[09:31:15] <holycrunchitz> I'm looping through a bunch of forms using .each, but I'm unable to use $(this).find('input')... it returns a blank array
[09:31:21] <holycrunchitz> any idea why?
[09:35:27] <amanda18> can somebody help me with my form
[09:35:38] <amanda18> or nobody knows how to
[09:39:06] <mikatone> amanda 18 what you need?
[09:44:13] <sigdk> This should be trivial: https://jsfiddle.net/ogj7sm0v/  How do I get a selector of the input box that I focused?
[09:44:38] <holycrunchitz> I figured it out. thanks anyway
[09:51:09] <sigdk> any hint on this: https://jsfiddle.net/ogj7sm0v/1/
[09:53:11] <d10magic> $conteudoimprimir = document.getElementById("vendafinalizada").html();
[09:53:23] <d10magic> why return html is not a function ?
[09:59:54] <AdamPDotty> sigdk: $("#"+this.id) = $(this)
[10:00:32] <AdamPDotty> $('.myclass')
[10:00:54] <AdamPDotty> and once more attach handler to container
[10:01:31] <sigdk> AdamPDotty, I don't get you...
[10:01:40] <AdamPDotty> pity
[10:02:00] <sigdk> AdamPDotty, oh... dot is missing
[10:02:22] <AdamPDotty> Do not leave home without it!
[10:09:56] <taplar> d10magic: getElementById is not a jQuery method.  it does not return a jQuery object
[10:11:37] <sigdk> Also, any idea whether the code at 2nd post here makes sense: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8439490/how-to-use-twitter-bootstrap-popovers-for-jquery-validation-notifications   ?
[10:11:57] <sigdk> he also gives a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3qYpM/2/
[10:12:25] <sigdk> I can't understand the purpose of all those returns
[10:13:06] <taplar> return on ln 10 doesn't make sense
[10:13:20] <taplar> nor ln 22
[10:13:36] <taplar> ln 12 could be returning the jQuery object but, *shrug*
[10:14:19] <taplar> the programmer may have been thinking of the usage of map, rather than each
[10:17:28] <sigdk> taplar, how often does this .validate() run? Any idea?
[10:17:50] <sigdk> what triggers the validation?
[10:19:10] <taplar> usually iirc jqueryvalidate fires on form submit

[11:37:38] <ExeciN> I tried populating a div with buttons (it worked) and then have something logged in the console upon clicking the buttons but it didn't work https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7b50291254638a623fc7d137334fe84a what am I doing wrong?
[12:21:55] <sigdk> I am using this stupid plugin:  https://jqueryvalidation.org/  I'm trying to make the form be validated *ONLY* when I click the button... I cannot find out how though. It seems that validation is triggered whenever I click on the text fields too. Any hints? http://jsfiddle.net/aog1tgz1/704/
[12:26:25] <robertmaxrees> sigdk https://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/#onfocusout
[12:26:44] <robertmaxrees> ther are a variety of options that you'd set false to - onfocusout, onclick, and onclick
[12:26:53] <robertmaxrees> maybe onsubmit?
[12:27:18] <ExeciN> I tried populating a div with buttons (it worked) and then have something logged in the console when you click those buttons. Nothing appears when I click the buttons though https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7b50291254638a623fc7d137334fe84a what am I doing wrong?
[12:27:32] <robertmaxrees> ExeciN you need to use a delegated listener.
[12:28:25] <taplar> robert!
[12:28:27] <robertmaxrees> ExeciN because the buttons don't yet exist when you do the binding - getJSON is async.
[12:28:31] <robertmaxrees> hey taplar :)
[12:28:38] <taplar> dude, i was kinda worried about you
[12:28:55] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[12:28:57] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[12:29:26] <taplar> you left early friday, and after what you said with the allergic reaction i was hoping nothing else came up
[12:29:33] <ExeciN> robertmaxrees: oh, can I somehow do it after getJSON finishes?
[12:29:45] <robertmaxrees> ExeciN sure - by using a delegated listener :)
[12:29:54] <ExeciN> oh, thanks
[12:30:00] <robertmaxrees> taplar i appreciate that man - I actually went to go be in a friends wedding.
[12:30:10] <taplar> good deal
[12:30:14] <robertmaxrees> ExeciN check out the docs for on for the bit about Direct and Delegated Events
[12:31:56] <RonaldsM> I tried this code and it's not working for me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AofECml9pQU
[12:32:41] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM that's not helpful :) can you share a link to the actual code and be more specific?
[12:32:53] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, thanks how did you figure it out? That's not clear from the description. Is it?
[12:33:01] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/JCRwp
[12:33:08] <robertmaxrees> sigdk i searched google heh
[12:33:28] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM so fcould you be more specific?  what do you mean "doesn't work"?
[12:33:30] <RonaldsM> it just add question mark to url
[12:33:35] <RonaldsM> adds
[12:33:39] <robertmaxrees> so the page reloads?
[12:33:53] <RonaldsM> yes
[12:33:56] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM open your console - any errors?
[12:34:17] <RonaldsM> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[12:35:27] <robertmaxrees> so fix that error first :)
[12:35:34] <robertmaxrees> also: dataString != datastring
[12:35:39] <robertmaxrees> need to fix casing on that var.
[12:36:39] <RonaldsM> it does not give the line error is at
[12:36:49] <sillyslux> url:"hi", will "hi" be rewritten by .htaccess to index.php?
[12:37:05] <RonaldsM> fixed dataString, still that
[12:37:24] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM so then it sounds like you have invalid html.  can you share the rendered html for that pagew?
[12:38:15] <RonaldsM> I shared code
[12:38:21] <sillyslux> taplar hi there, many thanks for yesterday :D
[12:38:31] <taplar> hey, no problem
[12:38:32] <RonaldsM> hi or hi.php no difference
[12:38:45] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM then you have invalid html.
[12:38:47] <robertmaxrees> fix that first.
[12:39:06] <RonaldsM> it's exactly the same like in the video
[12:39:22] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM i'm not going to watch a whole video :) sounds like you need to fix your html.
[12:39:52] <RonaldsM> but it's exactly the same
[12:40:00] <RonaldsM> and You can see my html in code
[12:40:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:40:04] <robertmaxrees> alright then.
[12:40:06] <robertmaxrees> dunno.  sorry!
[12:40:09] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/JCRwp
[12:40:54] <sillyslux> howitlookslike.vid :)
[12:41:00] <robertmaxrees> lol

[12:42:46] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM heh - really doesn't help to link the video.
[12:42:46] <robertmaxrees> can
[12:42:54] <robertmaxrees> *can't really expect people to watch it.
[12:42:55] <sillyslux> i'm tempted, but... my precious megabytes, i don't have that much of them... :(
[12:43:28] <RonaldsM> You don't need to watch it
[12:43:33] <RonaldsM> code is same
[12:43:36] <RonaldsM> in my apaste
[12:43:52] <robertmaxrees> your code looks valid there.  not sure how you expect people to help you now :)
[12:43:54] <sillyslux> your site is more than this piece of code
[12:44:03] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:44:19] <sillyslux> the error is somewhere else
[12:44:34] <robertmaxrees> right, which then cascades and causes the rest of your js to fail.
[12:44:38] <sillyslux> if you want exact line numbers, move the js to an external file
[12:45:02] <RonaldsM> I deleted every other line
[12:45:10] <RonaldsM> maybe wrong version of jquery
[12:45:12] <robertmaxrees> the paste you shared is not valid markup.
[12:45:22] <robertmaxrees> when you have invalid markup, you're going to have problems.
[12:45:27] <sillyslux> maybe you left some unclosed <script> tag somewhere
[12:47:36] <sillyslux> <script src="jquery.js"> and forgot `</script>` afterwards?
[12:48:03] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/
[12:48:08] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't cause the error he's seeing right now.
[12:48:37] <sillyslux> no? gotta try myself
[12:50:20] <taplar> i don't see html in that fiddle
[12:50:32] <robertmaxrees> he didn't paste it correctly taplar
[12:50:39] <robertmaxrees> he just pasted everything in both spots.
[12:50:43] <robertmaxrees> but the error is there.
[12:51:24] <taplar> just now poking my head in.  is he using an inline binding?
[12:51:43] <robertmaxrees> he was, but https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/1/ shows the error, too :)
[12:51:51] <RonaldsM> there is nor error in console
[12:51:54] <RonaldsM> anymore
[12:51:59] <RonaldsM> in external file
[12:52:05] <RonaldsM> but nothing loads anyway
[12:52:06] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM i'm seeing the error in the fiddle.
[12:53:03] <RonaldsM> but fiddle don't support php
[12:53:09] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:53:14] <robertmaxrees> the error is a js error, not a php error.
[12:54:10] <RonaldsM> which line
[12:54:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/2/ try this instead.
[12:54:30] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[12:54:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/3/ this
[12:56:31] <RonaldsM> doesn't work, just adds question mark to url
[12:57:37] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[12:58:09] <taplar> post params don't go on the url
[12:58:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/4/
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> he's probably not clear about how doc ready/js before html works.
[12:58:56] <taplar> ah
[12:59:16] <taplar> well yesterday he did have an issue with a post when he was expecting a get request
[13:04:16] <RonaldsM> now it echoes Response
[13:04:25] <RonaldsM> but nothing in name variable
[13:05:34] <robertmaxrees> "but nothing in name variable" on the PHP side?
[13:06:25] <RonaldsM> <?php $name = $_POST['name']; echo 'Response:'.$name;?>
[13:06:36] <robertmaxrees> so what are you getting?
[13:06:44] <RonaldsM> Response:
[13:06:51] <robertmaxrees> right - so do you see the problem?
[13:07:05] <RonaldsM> $name is not getting value
[13:07:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:07:18] <robertmaxrees> you're not posting correctly.
[13:07:32] <robertmaxrees> your "dataString" should actually be an object.
[13:07:40] <robertmaxrees> like, say, https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/7/
[13:07:43] <RonaldsM>     var dataString = 'name=' + name;
[13:07:55] <robertmaxrees> right, that's not the correct format for post.
[13:12:38] <RonaldsM> Ok, but how do I use this with textarea that has javascript function that takes enter as submit
[13:12:43] <RonaldsM> now it works
[13:13:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:13:56] <robertmaxrees> part of the reason you use textarea is because it allows multi-line input with enter.
[13:19:48] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/8/
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> ask questions yo.
[13:20:24] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use jsfiddle btw.
[13:20:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/9/
[13:20:50] <RonaldsM> question how do I mix functions
[13:20:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:21:02] <robertmaxrees> "mix functions"?
[13:21:30] <RonaldsM> yes now it does not post on enter
[13:22:02] <robertmaxrees> don't use a textarea for this fwiw.
[13:22:27] <robertmaxrees> and you have errors again.
[13:22:29] <robertmaxrees> try pressing enter.
[13:22:50] <RonaldsM> it just goes to next line
[13:23:09] <robertmaxrees> with your consoel open duder
[13:23:12] <robertmaxrees> *console
[13:23:49] <RonaldsM> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of null
[13:23:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:23:58] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you?
[13:23:59] <RonaldsM> 25 line
[13:24:22] <RonaldsM>     var fromuser = document.getElementById('fromuser').value;
[13:24:27] <RonaldsM> this is empty?
[13:24:40] <RonaldsM> no id
[13:24:46] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[13:25:16] <RonaldsM> now it works
[13:34:16] <RonaldsM> except text does not dissapear from textarea
[13:34:26] <RonaldsM> it posts to db too
[13:34:46] <RonaldsM> how do I make it dissapear
[13:34:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:35:10] <robertmaxrees> why are you using a textarea here again?
[13:35:26] <robertmaxrees> either way, setting the value to an empty string is generall what people do.
[13:35:58] <RonaldsM> so value=""
[13:36:18] <robertmaxrees> if you want the raw js way, sure.
[13:36:42] <RonaldsM> still does not dissapear
[13:36:47] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> toss me a bone here, dude.  update the fiddle, show me what you've tried.
[13:37:56] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/13/
[13:38:22] <robertmaxrees> also:
[13:38:29] <robertmaxrees> stop adding js tags to the javascript area on jsfiddle.
[13:38:33] <robertmaxrees> i keep removing them.
[13:39:01] <robertmaxrees> also: where are you emptying the the textarea?
[13:39:23] <robertmaxrees> oh and you want === not ==./
[13:40:13] <RonaldsM> <textarea id="textarea" class="msg_input" name="message" value="" rows="4"></textarea>
[13:40:20] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:40:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to do it in your js.
[13:40:44] <RonaldsM> how
[13:40:45] <taplar> textarea don't have a value attribute, btw
[13:41:09] <robertmaxrees> search google.
[13:41:10] <robertmaxrees> :)

[13:43:52] <RonaldsM> Uncaught ReferenceError: clearContents is not defined
[13:43:52] <hellyeah> yo
[13:44:00] <RonaldsM> yo
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM one last time: the fiddle.
[13:44:07] <robertmaxrees> update it and share the update.
[13:44:20] <hellyeah> listen to robertmaxrees
[13:44:27] <hellyeah> you wont regret it :p
[13:44:37] <sillyslux> ^^
[13:44:38] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/15/
[13:44:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:45:05] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/16/
[13:45:07] <robertmaxrees> why are you creatinga  new function there like that?
[13:45:08] <RonaldsM> this one
[13:45:20] <robertmaxrees> so a few things:
[13:45:28] <robertmaxrees> 1: don't use inline event bindings - use .on()
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> 2: functions have scope, so clearContents doesn't exist outside of that success callback.
[13:46:07] <robertmaxrees> 3: you should totally check out learn.jquery.com and try.jquery.com :)
[13:46:21] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/17/
[13:46:42] <robertmaxrees> don't use onfocus - use .on()
[13:47:16] <RonaldsM> on( on="clearContents(this);"
[13:47:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:47:28] <RonaldsM> on="clearContents(this);"
[13:47:29] <robertmaxrees> think like $('form').on('submit', function(e) {
[13:47:31] <robertmaxrees> dude
[13:47:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/19/
[13:48:09] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, check out those tutorials.
[13:48:33] <hellyeah> btw
[13:48:48] <hellyeah> mixing js and jquery in that way is good thing or bad thing?
[13:48:52] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/20/
[13:48:58] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah i generally avoid it but i'
[13:49:10] <robertmaxrees> *i'm just trying to help RonaldsM learn some basics.
[13:49:30] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM need to get rid of the onfocus inb your htnl.
[13:49:37] <hellyeah> hmm he used $(..) also document.getelementbyid(..)
[13:49:49] <robertmaxrees> also you don't want the submit of the form.
[13:49:56] <robertmaxrees> that was just an example of how to use .on()
[13:50:15] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah heh, yeah.  domn't worry about that part yet.
[13:50:22] <hellyeah> okey
[13:50:35] <RonaldsM> Uncaught ReferenceError: clearContents is not defined
[13:50:45] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM why are you ignoring my advice to look at the docs and stuff?
[13:51:00] <robertmaxrees> this is all pretty quick and easy if you checkj out the tutorials.
[13:51:15] <RonaldsM> those documents are painfull to understand from my point of view
[13:51:34] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to learn how to use them though.
[13:51:41] <robertmaxrees> because you'll rely on them in the future.
[13:51:49] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/21/
[13:51:50] <sillyslux> or on irc
[13:51:56] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/19/
[13:52:02] <hellyeah> no clear contenthere btw
[13:52:09] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah pl;ease let him try :)
[13:52:16] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM yeah, you really need to do a basic tutorial.
[13:52:39] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty clear you're lost about how the basics work - luckily, try.jquery.com and learn.jquery.com are both excellent places to start.
[13:52:56] <hellyeah> codeschool has also nice tutorial
[13:53:02] <robertmaxrees> and codecademy, too :)
[13:53:18] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM you'll never learn if you keep having us spoon-feed you every little thing.  trust me :)
[13:53:45] <RonaldsM> I'm using https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/19/
[13:53:49] <hellyeah> Ronald
[13:53:52] <hellyeah> ops
[13:54:26] <RonaldsM> hey:59 Uncaught ReferenceError: clearContents is not defined
[13:54:48] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM that error doesn't exist in my fiddle.
[13:55:20] <RonaldsM> okay but text don't dissapear
[13:55:21] <hellyeah> man i didnt see that error in /19/
[13:55:34] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM that fiddle works for me.
[13:55:44] <RonaldsM> there is no error if I take of onfocus=""
[13:55:53] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM right - remove onfocus attribute.
[13:56:00] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't be there - you shouldn't use it.
[13:56:15] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to clear the input on focus or on blur?
[13:56:16] <RonaldsM> but text don't dissapear on post
[13:56:27] <sillyslux> RonaldsM, at one point you'll have to throw in some beers for #jquery
[13:56:29] <robertmaxrees> so you want it to happen on post?
[13:56:36] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM so how do you think you'd do that?
[13:56:38] <RonaldsM> yeah
[13:57:41] <RonaldsM> $('#textarea').on('submit', function() {
[13:57:54] <robertmaxrees> you already have one of those, yeah?
[13:58:07] <hellyeah> RonaldsM: you want to make input box empty after you pst data?
[13:58:12] <RonaldsM> nothing happened
[13:58:17] <hellyeah> post*
[13:58:26] <RonaldsM> yes textarea should become empty
[13:58:39] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM so show us your current code.
[13:58:53] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/19/
[13:59:16] <robertmaxrees> heh - not what he wants sillyslux :)
[13:59:39] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/22/
[13:59:47] <hellyeah> RonaldsM:  good you used correct work :)
[14:00:02] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM right, so you already have a submit handler for the form - why not use that instead?
[14:00:11] <robertmaxrees> also: only forms have submits - textareas don't.
[14:01:09] <RonaldsM> $('form > textarea').on('keyup', function(e){
[14:01:09] <RonaldsM> 	this.value = '';
[14:01:09] <RonaldsM> });
[14:01:25] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste multiple lines at omnce.
[14:01:30] <robertmaxrees> why are you ignoring what i'm saying btw?
[14:01:38] <robertmaxrees> you already have a submit handler - why aren't you using it?
[14:01:51] <RonaldsM> I'm trying to use submit handler
[14:02:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:02:10] <robertmaxrees> > $('form > textarea').on('keyup' is for keyup.
[14:02:16] <RonaldsM> ok
[14:02:18] <robertmaxrees> why would you put it in there if you want it for submit?
[14:03:10] <RonaldsM> what is wrong with $('#textarea').on('submit', function() {this.value = '';
[14:03:10] <RonaldsM> });
[14:03:17] <robertmaxrees> again
[14:03:23] <robertmaxrees> textareas don't have a submit event.
[14:03:25] <robertmaxrees> forms do.
[14:03:31] <robertmaxrees> you already have a submit handler on the first, so why not use that.
[14:03:38] <RonaldsM> then what event I should make it to
[14:03:50] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to make anothe rhandler.
[14:03:57] <robertmaxrees> you already have an event handler for form submits that you should use.
[14:04:51] <RonaldsM> I don't get what line of code I should use
[14:05:12] <robertmaxrees> do you not see the form submit hanmdler in your code?
[14:06:00] <RonaldsM> $('#textarea').on('submit', function(e) {this.value = '';});
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:06:15] <robertmaxrees> your current code already has a form submit handler
[14:06:26] <robertmaxrees> that's a textarea submit handler, which wouldn't make sense.
[14:06:42] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function(e) {
[14:06:51] <robertmaxrees> that's a form submit handler, which your code already uses.
[14:07:03] <RonaldsM> okay
[14:07:03] <robertmaxrees> so you can add stuff to that instead of needing another event binding.
[14:07:33] <RonaldsM> this.value='';
[14:07:54] <robertmaxrees> right - you wouldn't use 'this' any more.
[14:07:57] <robertmaxrees> what do you think you'd use?
[14:08:10] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/23/
[14:08:23] <RonaldsM> I don't know
[14:08:39] <robertmaxrees> how have you targeted the textarea before?
[14:09:33] <RonaldsM>  $(this).parent('form').trigger('submit');
[14:09:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:10:00] <robertmaxrees> no.  in the current code you're targeting the textarea.
[14:10:09] <RonaldsM> how
[14:10:09] <robertmaxrees> how would you select the textarea?
[14:10:28] <RonaldsM> 	  textarea.value = '';
[14:10:35] <RonaldsM> I'm guessing
[14:10:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:10:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd really suggest learn.jquery.com or try.jquery.com at this point.
[14:11:10] <hellyeah> RonaldsM:  you are confused
[14:11:12] <robertmaxrees> the help you're going to get here kind of assumes that you are able to select elements.
[14:11:25] <hellyeah> you should read smt or watch vids
[14:11:35] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah he DID watch a video.
[14:11:40] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that he skipped the basics :)
[14:11:40] <RonaldsM> $('#textarea').on('submit', function(e) {this.value = '';
[14:11:40] <RonaldsM> });
[14:11:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:11:52] <RonaldsM> this is basic
[14:11:52] <robertmaxrees> again
[14:12:02] <robertmaxrees>  $('#textarea').on('submit', will never work
[14:12:08] <RonaldsM> then what will
[14:12:09] <sillyslux> no submit events on textareas
[14:12:13] <robertmaxrees> there is no submit event for textareas.
[14:12:15] <robertmaxrees> period.
[14:12:27] <RonaldsM> what will work
[14:12:30] <robertmaxrees> so stop doing that.  go to the tutorials i've referenced a few times and give them a try.
[14:12:42] <robertmaxrees> if you're still lost, feel free to come back here :)
[14:12:47] <hellyeah> textare event
[14:12:54] <RonaldsM> I am not lost, You just don't give me code of line
[14:12:57] <hellyeah> tetarea
[14:13:01] <RonaldsM> I can't imagine this
[14:13:01] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM correct.
[14:13:06] <robertmaxrees> because that's not how this chat works :)
[14:13:10] <hellyeah> RonaldsM:  they wont gibe it to you
[14:13:16] <hellyeah> give*
[14:13:17] <sillyslux> i admire your patience robertmaxrees
[14:13:32] <RonaldsM> and after that You talk how much time is wasted
[14:13:35] <robertmaxrees> we provide support - i've already shown you the bits.  the assumption is that you're able to put the pieces together and get what you need.
[14:13:35] <hellyeah> sillyslux:  taplar did the same for me
[14:13:43] <hellyeah> i respect those guys
[14:13:51] <RonaldsM> when You could adress the issue with correct line of code
[14:13:53] <sillyslux> there's #freelance where you can get a line and two and three
[14:13:56] <robertmaxrees> we showed you.
[14:14:11] <sillyslux> here you get help
[14:14:15] <hellyeah> :D
[14:14:19] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM you really should check out the tutorial and cover the basics.
[14:14:29] <RonaldsM> like how will You select textarea
[14:14:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:14:35] <hellyeah> RonaldsM:  how you select element?
[14:14:38] <RonaldsM> I give line where it's selected
[14:14:58] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM and then how to work with selected elements.
[14:15:00] <RonaldsM> and You say that submits can't be done on textarea
[14:15:07] <robertmaxrees> and the basics of event handlers.
[14:15:14] <robertmaxrees> right - so you'd do it in the form submit handler.
[14:15:28] <sillyslux> hah... i think i'll continue my fiddle plugins tonight :)
[14:15:46] <sillyslux> is #mootools still active?
[14:15:53] <RonaldsM> where else should I do it
[14:15:59] <RonaldsM> enlighten me
[14:16:02] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM in the form submit handler.
[14:16:05] <robertmaxrees> the one you already have.
[14:16:28] <RonaldsM> but that is exactly the same thing that You said can't be done on textareas
[14:16:40] <robertmaxrees> you can't do it on textareas.
[14:16:42] <robertmaxrees> but you can on forms.
[14:16:45] <robertmaxrees> forms have a submit event.
[14:16:55] <hellyeah> select form ?
[14:17:06] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah he already has what he needs.
[14:17:08] <sillyslux> which is exactly robertmaxrees already said many times?
[14:17:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:17:30] <robertmaxrees> you have a form submit handler (the $('form').on('submit' dealio)
[14:17:39] <robertmaxrees> you would empty the value inside that handler.
[14:17:55] <RonaldsM> yeah
[14:18:08] <robertmaxrees> so you'd put your code in that function,.
[14:18:21] <hellyeah> yeah check the val()
[14:18:28] <hellyeah> :p
[14:18:39] <robertmaxrees> or use the native js way you've been using.
[14:19:11] <RonaldsM> what was wrong with this one  $('#textarea').on('focus', function() { this.value = ''; });
[14:19:25] <robertmaxrees> you said you want it when the form posts, right?
[14:19:48] <RonaldsM> change focus to submit
[14:19:51] <RonaldsM> or
[14:19:53] <robertmaxrees> bi,
[14:19:56] <robertmaxrees> *no
[14:20:00] <hellyeah> :S
[14:20:03] <robertmaxrees> because texareas don't have a submit event.
[14:20:06] <robertmaxrees> for the thousandth time.
[14:20:41] <d10magic> anyone use jspdf ?
[14:20:42] <RonaldsM> I can't dream this up
[14:20:49] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM where are you lost?
[14:20:57] <robertmaxrees> you already have a form submit handler in your code - you';d empty it in there.
[14:21:01] <robertmaxrees> along with the other stuff you've got.
[14:21:14] <robertmaxrees> d10magic lots of people - though microbenchmarks are kind of silly.
[14:21:28] <RonaldsM> $('#textarea').on('post', function() { this.value = ''; });
[14:21:39] <robertmaxrees> dude
[14:21:39] <hellyeah> post?
[14:21:43] <d10magic> robertmaxrees: hum
[14:21:47] <robertmaxrees> i already showed you the line you're looking for RonaldsM
[14:22:01] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function() { -> you already have this line in your code.
[14:22:06] <robertmaxrees> put it in that function.
[14:22:13] <d10magic> robertmaxrees
[14:22:13] <d10magic> I added the jspdf.js on the page
[14:22:20] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ajzopzpL/19/
[14:22:21] <robertmaxrees> ooooh jspdf not jsperf derp
[14:22:28] <RonaldsM> this is Your last fiddle
[14:22:28] <d10magic> but saveAs is not defined ReferenceError: saveAs is not defined
[14:22:30] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM correct.
[14:22:35] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM see how you have $('form').on('submit', function(e) { there?
[14:22:46] <robertmaxrees> and that's where you put all the other code to happen when the form submits?
[14:23:13] <hellyeah> RonaldsM: go with /19/
[14:23:23] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah not helpful;.
[14:23:28] <hellyeah> sorry
[14:23:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:23:39] <hellyeah> but code is there :D
[14:23:54] <hellyeah> he just needs to focus on and understand /19/
[14:23:56] <RonaldsM> it's same code You said that cannot be done with textarea
[14:24:01] <hellyeah> correct?
[14:24:15] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah slow down.
[14:24:19] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM $('form').on('submit', function(e) { is good.
[14:24:25] <robertmaxrees> $('#textarea').on('submit', function(e) { is not.
[14:25:07] <RonaldsM> but how I can adress that same thing to textarea
[14:25:33] <robertmaxrees> let's flip this - how are you gedtting the value of the textarea right now?
[14:25:54] <RonaldsM>     var textarea = document.getElementById('textarea').value;
[14:26:04] <robertmaxrees> great - so now let's say you wanted to SET the value.
[14:26:11] <robertmaxrees> what would you do?
[14:26:23] <RonaldsM> I don't know
[14:26:30] <robertmaxrees> how do you set a variable in JS?
[14:26:55] <RonaldsM> document.getElementById('myTextarea').value = '';
[14:27:19] <robertmaxrees> have you tried?
[14:27:33] <RonaldsM> nop
[14:27:37] <RonaldsM> does it work
[14:27:38] <RonaldsM> ?
[14:27:44] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[14:27:46] <hellyeah> xD
[14:28:05] <RonaldsM> oh
[14:28:08] <RonaldsM> it worked
[14:28:12] <RonaldsM> boom
[14:28:14] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:28:24] <robertmaxrees> so litearlly everything you've asked about is addressed in the tutorials.
[14:28:30] <robertmaxrees> you really do need to give thema  once-over.
[14:28:59] <RonaldsM> those so called apis are just imposible to go trought , maybe cause english is not my native
[14:29:19] <robertmaxrees> which is why learn.jquery.com and try.jquery.com are structured differently.
[14:29:26] <robertmaxrees> they introduce you do a lot of basics.
[14:30:10] <RonaldsM> Ok I try them later
[14:30:15] <robertmaxrees> the api docs come in handy down the road.
[14:30:18] <robertmaxrees> but you need the basics.
[14:30:32] <robertmaxrees> you're also mixing and matching jquery and vanilla js which is a little strange.
[14:31:26] <RonaldsM> there is last thing I need to make, it's scrolling function
[14:31:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:31:40] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so where are you lost?
[14:32:00] <RonaldsM> my chat will be something like this http://packetcode.com/apps/facebook-like-chat/
[14:32:33] <RonaldsM> I need to scroll down msg_body https://github.com/shaadomanthra/facebook-like-chat/blob/master/index.php
[14:32:43] <robertmaxrees> be more specific.
[14:37:18] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:
[14:37:59] <RonaldsM> as messages get posted scrollbarr gets longer
[14:38:07] <hellyeah> are you against mixing js and jquery totally? or do you find mixing those way weird.  I mean selecting element with $(..) then with document.getelementbyid(..)
[14:38:12] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM so you want to scroll to bottom?
[14:38:21] * hellyeah back off
[14:38:26] <RonaldsM> yeah
[14:38:42] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah jquery IS javascript -  what you're asking is if you should mix and mathx getElementByID and basic selectors
[14:38:45] <robertmaxrees> that's highly dependent.
[14:38:52] <robertmaxrees> 9/10, use jquery if you're alreayd using it.
[14:39:10] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10503606/scroll-to-bottom-of-div-on-page-load-jquery
[14:39:17] <robertmaxrees> google is great for stuff like this.
[14:39:53] <hellyeah> i understand
[14:41:59] <RonaldsM> $('#msg_body').scrollTop($('#mgs_body')[0].scrollHeight);
[14:42:00] <robertmaxrees> like, if you're gonna use jquery, just use it.  no need to make things confusing.
[14:42:13] <Guest6958> https://jsfiddle.net/0r7bhm0L/5/ Hi there I have an each loop running through each sub li - I am having problem running it through each sub > sub > li and placing it under the sub > li any ideas?!?
[14:42:13] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM that's one way.
[14:43:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?  do you want .sub-sub > li or..?
[14:43:10] <hellyeah> once i did manual scroll with scrolltop
[14:43:10] <hellyeah> .D
[14:43:13] <arc_> hellyeah jquery is just doing the javascript way of doing it behind the scenes. all that would accomplish is making the code way less readable
[14:43:15] <robertmaxrees> also you have invalid markup.
[14:43:22] <Guest6958> yes sub-sub-li
[14:43:27] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 you need to fix your html first.
[14:43:37] <Guest6958> eah sub-sub-li to be applied under each sub-li
[14:43:44] * hellyeah w3c validator
[14:43:52] <robertmaxrees> you can only have <li> as a durect child of <ul> - right now you have <ul> as a direct child, aS WELL.
[14:43:54] <robertmaxrees> CAN'T DO THAT.
[14:43:57] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[14:44:01] <robertmaxrees> didn't mean the caps lol
[14:44:03] <Guest6958> Oh yeah
[14:45:21] <RonaldsM> that one way doesn't do
[14:45:25] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[14:45:28] <Guest6958> Let me amend it and get back if thats ok
[14:45:40] <mikatone> Hi, I'm not sure why I went to javascript channel but they seriously hate jQuery, bad start but I don't get why... well I don't understand why I can't capture this span text but I surly hope I can learn something here
[14:45:46] <mikatone> http://jsbin.com/jozukutejo/edit?html,js,console,output
[14:46:23] <robertmaxrees> mikatone .closest() searches up the tree./
[14:46:24] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/24/
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM so that'll only happen once.
[14:47:08] <robertmaxrees> also: where's #msg_body?
[14:47:25] <RonaldsM> 		<div class="msg_body">
[14:47:32] <robertmaxrees> that's a class.
[14:47:33] <robertmaxrees> not an id.
[14:47:37] <RonaldsM> oh right
[14:48:00] <mikatone> robertmaxrees you mean outside parent <div> ?
[14:48:29] <RonaldsM> <div id="msg_body" class="msg_body"> still don't scrolles
[14:48:30] <robertmaxrees> mikatone i mean .closest() searches parent elemenmts - span is a sibling of the one you're selecting in that handlker.
[14:48:38] <hellyeah> night
[14:48:43] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM update the fiddle.
[14:49:00] <mikatone> robertmaxrees and find?
[14:49:11] <RonaldsM> the function is there
[14:49:16] <robertmaxrees> mikatone .find() goes through children
[14:49:26] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM oh ok.
[14:49:26] <RonaldsM> should I add html of chat
[14:49:27] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.
[14:49:50] <RonaldsM> ?
[14:50:54] <mikatone> robertmaxrees so the tree is the div where button and span live right? By using closest it goes outside the div and find would go inside the button?
[14:51:21] <plamb_> if i have a <ul><li></li><li></li></ul> and i do a $('ul').first() will it select the first <li> ?
[14:51:32] <plamb_> right now its selecting the <ul>
[14:52:11] <robertmaxrees> mikatone huh?
[14:52:23] <robertmaxrees> .closest() goes through all parent elements until it finds something that matches.
[14:52:33] <robertmaxrees> your bin is looking for a span, which is not a parent of the element you're selecting.
[14:52:47] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ no.
[14:52:54] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ that'll get you the first ul in the selection.
[14:52:56] <plamb_> whats the best way to get the first li
[14:53:12] <robertmaxrees> $('ul').find('li').first();
[14:53:13] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:53:51] <mikatone> robertmaxrees <div class="parent">    <input></input>    <button></button>  </div>  <div class="siblings">    <p class="children"></p>  </div>
[14:53:59] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:54:05] <robertmaxrees> that's not your current html.
[14:54:36] <mikatone> I know just to clear the parent children and siblings issue
[14:54:45] <arc_> i don't really get what it would mean for siblings to not be part of the parent
[14:54:55] <arc_> but i haven't been paying attention so
[14:55:03] <robertmaxrees> mikatone a sibling is an element at the same level.
[14:55:16] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/26/
[14:55:18] <mikatone> and children ?
[14:55:38] <robertmaxrees> elements that are descendeds of the cuirrent element.,
[14:55:42] <RonaldsM> this is not good example cause posting messages don't work
[14:55:46] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM bad example.
[14:56:56] <mikatone> ok so in this case I need to capture the span text which is a sibling right?
[14:57:07] <robertmaxrees> mikatone that's one way.
[14:57:15] <RonaldsM> this is exact code from that git
[14:57:16] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/27/
[14:57:17] <robertmaxrees> mikatone i'd .closest() to get the first shared parent element perosnally.
[14:57:29] <RonaldsM> still does not post messages
[14:57:32] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM that's not the case you're solving for though, is it?
[14:57:52] <RonaldsM> scrolling down is case
[14:58:07] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:58:12] <robertmaxrees> so make a test case to figure that out :)
[14:58:16] <mikatone> robertmaxrees so I have to go parent and then search for siblings?
[14:58:35] <robertmaxrees> mikatone you go to parent and then find the child of that parent.
[14:59:26] <mikatone> ok nice so I guess that .closest('div').find('span')...
[14:59:45] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/27/
[14:59:47] <robertmaxrees> mikatone that'll do it.  i might give those elements classes to select on but either way.
[14:59:49] <RonaldsM> maybe this one
[14:59:54] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0v417ago/ you want something like this.
[14:59:58] <robertmaxrees> you need scrollable content.
[15:00:55] <mikatone> robertmaxrees thank you so much, the best teacher ever on the irc believe me I always learn something from you :)
[15:01:10] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/0v417ago/2/
[15:01:40] <robertmaxrees> mikatone lol
[15:01:51] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM so what's thje issue with your last fiddle?
[15:01:55] <robertmaxrees> what do you think the problem might be?
[15:02:02] <RonaldsM> no id
[15:02:09] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:02:16] <robertmaxrees> (try using just 'div'
[15:02:22] <mikatone> :D
[15:02:39] <RonaldsM> looks like it scrolled down
[15:02:51] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/0v417ago/3/
[15:03:06] <robertmaxrees> cool
[15:03:25] <RonaldsM> why that does not happen in my code
[15:03:36] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM what's your code?
[15:07:15] <Guest6958> https://jsfiddle.net/0r7bhm0L/6/ Hi there I have an each loop running through each sub li - I am having problem running it through each sub > sub > li and placing it under the sub > li any ideas?!?
[15:07:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:07:33] <Guest6958> :)
[15:08:10] <robertmaxrees> so look at your html and revise your question.
[15:08:15] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/30/
[15:08:16] <anexit> Anyone here running seamless iframe?
[15:08:24] <robertmaxrees> anexit define "seamless"
[15:08:45] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM how would this scroll?
[15:08:52] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing to scroll in there....
[15:09:10] <anexit> https://github.com/travist/seamless.js?files=1
[15:09:16] <anexit> Just looking for a demo
[15:09:20] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/31/
[15:09:26] <RonaldsM> this one
[15:09:34] <RonaldsM> why it does not scroll down
[15:09:34] <robertmaxrees> now open your console.
[15:09:37] <robertmaxrees> what do you see?
[15:09:48] <anexit> My wife looking at me.
[15:10:01] <Guest6958>  https://jsfiddle.net/0r7bhm0L/6/ Hi there I have an each loop running through each sub li - I am having a problem getting the sub li to format correctly any ideas?!?
[15:10:03] <RonaldsM> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[15:10:11] <robertmaxrees> anexit the readme shows you how.
[15:10:15] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/travist/seamless.js#connect
[15:10:36] <anexit> robertmaxrees: I know how, just wondering how others like it.
[15:10:39] <robertmaxrees> Guest6958 ... lol i'm lost about what you're trying to do.
[15:10:46] <anexit> has a bunch of implaments for jquery
[15:10:47] <robertmaxrees> anexit ah you want feedback about that plugin?
[15:10:52] <anexit> yes sir
[15:11:09] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look hugely popular.
[15:11:20] <anexit> I know
[15:11:28] <Guest6958> Can you see fromthe fiddle I am trying to run through each sub li and under each sub li I would like the sub sub li to appear as links
[15:11:29] <robertmaxrees> why are you using iframes in the first place btw?
[15:11:41] <Guest6958> https://jsfiddle.net/0r7bhm0L/6/
[15:11:47] <anexit> iframes are cool
[15:11:48] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 so why are you doing this via js?
[15:12:04] <robertmaxrees> anexit they;'re a pain in the ass - why do you think you need them?
[15:12:11] <RonaldsM> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'scrollHeight' of undefined
[15:12:15] <Guest6958> Not entirely sure are you suggesting I should try PHP?
[15:12:32] <anexit> robertmaxrees: They're sandboxes
[15:12:42] <robertmaxrees> anexit what do you need sandboxed?
[15:12:50] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 i'm asking why you're doing this via js on the client-side :) sounds like you're trying to give them some default styling.
[15:12:51] <anexit> avoid javascript conflicts
[15:12:55] <robertmaxrees> anexit eeeh.
[15:13:01] <anexit> more secure!
[15:13:03] <robertmaxrees> there are a ton of ways to do that much better than using iframes.
[15:13:09] <robertmaxrees> not inherently.
[15:13:18] <robertmaxrees> are you iframing content from other pages?
[15:13:18] <Guest6958> I was just thinking of adding in a menu like a mega menu of sorts
[15:13:39] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 yeah - sounds like you want to structure your html differently.  i wouldn't do that via js tbh.
[15:13:50] <anexit> yeah
[15:13:58] <anexit> privacy
[15:14:05] <robertmaxrees> anexit you're just saying words and phrases fwiw.
[15:14:05] <Guest6958> In what way robertmaxrees
[15:14:13] <Guest6958> I'm not sure I understand?
[15:14:25] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 so what's the end result you're looking for?
[15:14:38] <anexit> http://benvinegar.github.io/seamless-talk/
[15:14:42] <anexit> hehe
[15:15:04] <robertmaxrees> anexit you know how hold this must be, yeah?
[15:15:28] <Guest6958> Well lets say i have a wp menu with a sub menu at two tier and then another menu at third tier I would like to remove the menu entirely and then rebuild it back via js and appending the href and text from the links
[15:15:31] <anexit> yeah
[15:15:40] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 why not just show and hide?
[15:15:51] <anexit> I'm just sick of carring php sessions across stuff
[15:15:55] <anexit> carrying
[15:16:11] <anexit> I can pull a iframe with a simple auth against the database
[15:16:15] <Guest6958> Not Sure I understand in this way I can apply any style I wish to the menu
[15:16:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not how i'd do that anexit
[15:16:36] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/32/
[15:16:36] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 you should just be using mouseenter/mouseleave.
[15:16:42] <robertmaxrees> you could do this entirely via css even.
[15:16:47] <Guest6958> I will be applying this after
[15:16:58] <Guest6958> I need the menu struture in place before this
[15:17:03] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM you need to inclkude jquery in your fiddle.
[15:17:09] <Guest6958> I just need to .each() through the sub sub links
[15:17:18] <Guest6958> I am not sure how to do it
[15:17:43] <anexit> yeah
[15:18:13] <anexit> I'll do some digging into it, I have a small app that I would like to use iframes to adjust to smaller devices (tablets and tapscreens
[15:18:16] <anexit> );
[15:18:31] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0r7bhm0L/7/
[15:18:37] <RonaldsM> how
[15:18:38] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/35/
[15:18:41] <robertmaxrees> anexit really would avoid iframes.
[15:18:59] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM click the "javascript" title - libraries and frameworks.
[15:19:02] <robertmaxrees> select jquery out of that,.
[15:19:03] <robertmaxrees> done.
[15:19:18] <anexit> robertmaxrees: Yeah, I'll see what I can come up with;
[15:19:36] <robertmaxrees> anexit like...  we do tons of session management here - it's really not that difficult.
[15:20:23] <taplar> using iframes to show mobile layout? :/
[15:20:24] <RonaldsM> does not scroll down
[15:20:55] <Guest6958> Thanks Robert Still not entirely sure how I would get an each() loop inside another each() loop
[15:21:04] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM what do you think i'm about to ask you?
[15:21:11] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 easy - $(this).each()
[15:21:23] <Guest6958> inside another each?
[15:21:31] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 you can do that, yes.
[15:21:40] <Guest6958> ahhhhhh
[15:21:47] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid it tbh.
[15:21:48] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[15:21:55] <RonaldsM> nah, I don't know
[15:21:56] <Guest6958> whys that?
[15:22:04] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM show me the code.
[15:22:15] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM just like i've asked every other time you've said something doesn't work.
[15:22:15] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/ajzopzpL/38/
[15:22:27] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 because it really doesn't seem like you need to be doing that much.
[15:22:36] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to hide/show things.
[15:22:44] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM you changed the code...
[15:22:53] <Guest6958> I need to in order to generate a mega menu list
[15:23:01] <Guest6958> split the whole li's into divs
[15:23:10] <Guest6958> and have a 3 tier menu
[15:23:14] <robertmaxrees> why are you generating that dynamically?
[15:23:40] <Guest6958> Because coding the thing via PHP would be a nightmare
[15:23:51] <robertmaxrees> Guest66203 erm...
[15:23:57] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:24:16] <Guest6958> Not sure about the loops required to do it
[15:24:30] <Guest6958> this way I can do the whole thing via Jquery
[15:24:30] <robertmaxrees> then learn them.
[15:24:34] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:24:40] <robertmaxrees> so i would avoid that as much as possible.
[15:24:46] <robertmaxrees> that's how you wind up with crazy performance issues.
[15:24:48] <Guest6958> avoid what?
[15:24:53] <robertmaxrees> doing it via js
[15:25:12] <Guest6958> what by using an each loop incorrectly?
[15:25:36] <robertmaxrees> doing dom manipulation like that can have serious and real performance impact.
[15:25:46] <robertmaxrees> also: tyou generally want your html to reflect the actual base state of the page.
[15:25:50] <Guest6958> I know i've heard of that too
[15:26:03] <Guest6958> I know thats what I was thinking
[15:26:10] <robertmaxrees> generating menus dynamically like that is a really inefficient and extremely cumbersome way to do that.
[15:26:12] <Guest6958> in fact i'm glad you said that
[15:26:18] <robertmaxrees> so use php to generate the correct markup for the menu,
[15:26:22] <Guest6958> yeah... thats kinda what I though
[15:26:45] <Guest6958> cheers for that! i will try and get it done PHP your right!
[15:26:47] <Guest6958> many thanks
[15:27:02] <robertmaxrees> sure

[15:27:42] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsM so why wouldn't it work?
[15:27:47] <robertmaxrees> can you think of any reasons why?
[15:28:13] <robertmaxrees> it's a mistake you've made quite a few times already.
[15:30:42] <RonaldsM> element is right one
[15:30:48] <RonaldsM> code seems too
[15:31:03] <RonaldsM> sorry I don't know
[15:31:11] <robertmaxrees> wrong element.

[15:33:04] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:33:07] <robertmaxrees> did you try?
[15:33:59] <RonaldsM> it's same as my code now, but in my websyte it does not scroll down
[15:34:14] <RonaldsM> how to select by class

[16:06:30] <Xentil> hello everybody
[16:08:00] <taplar> yo
[16:21:46] <sigdk> Hello, running this multiple times: https://jsfiddle.net/7p32rcjr/1/  I get different results. Sometimes the predifined user value at the dropdown is set, others not. How can I make sure that the dropdown has been populated before I set a value to it?
[16:23:53] <taplar> are you expecting one ajax to finish before the other?
[16:25:06] <sigdk> taplar, yes
[16:25:33] <taplar> then you need to have the first one return $.ajax so it will return the promise/deferred for that call
[16:25:47] <taplar> and attach the call to the second to that promise inside a then()
[16:27:08] <sigdk> taplar, can you write the skeleton?
[16:27:24] <sigdk> may I put one ajax call inside the .done() of the other?
[16:27:59] <taplar> $.ajax().then(function(){ $.ajax() });
[16:28:01] <sigdk> or tell me what to google for :)
[16:29:19] <sigdk> taplar, how about I put it inside .done ?
[16:29:38] <taplar> sure
[16:32:54] <sigdk> taplar, is done executed before or after then?
[16:34:33] <taplar> uh, not sure.  possibly after
[16:34:44] <taplar> then() is going to specify the success and fail callbacks
[16:34:49] <taplar> done() is regardless
[16:35:17] <Aljone> hey guys, i wonder, i have a link that when clicked fire ajax request, how do i find the script that blocks the a link and preform an ajax?
[16:35:49] <taplar> does the link have an id or a class on it?
[16:35:57] <Aljone> no
[16:36:11] <taplar> is there an inline onClick on it?
[16:36:14] <Aljone> nop
[16:36:21] <Aljone> i can post u the link
[16:36:24] <Aljone> so u can see
[16:36:32] <taplar> and the href is a real url?
[16:36:35] <Aljone> yes
[16:37:04] <Aljone> i pmed u the link
[16:37:25] <sigdk> taplar, I thought done is for success: "Deprecation Notice: The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callbacks are removed as of jQuery 3.0. You can use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead."
[16:37:54] <taplar> ah
[16:38:14] <taplar> well then() is used for success and failure as part of the promise/a++ standard
[16:38:53] <Aljone> taplar: ideas?
[16:51:26] <sigdk> taplar, is there any way to rewrite this: https://jsfiddle.net/7p32rcjr/1/ keeping my functions as components?
[16:51:41] <sigdk> because as you said, it has to be nested
[16:51:52] <taplar> yeah, like i said, return from your function the $.ajax
[16:52:44] <taplar> function a() { return $.ajax(); } function b(){ $.ajax(); }       a().then(function(){ b() };
[16:52:57] <taplar> or done(), whatever
[17:15:50] <antarrah> How do I turn this into an event delegation: $('.ui.dropdown').dropdown({ }); ... now it's only being applied to items that are showing on the page, not when I add items with the same class
[17:16:27] <taplar> you wouldn't.  you'd call it on the new items after they are inserted
[17:17:51] <antarrah> taplar: that sucks :( I hoped there was a way to say hook it to all existing and new items
[17:18:19] <antarrah> using .on() or something
[17:18:27] <taplar> there isn't an event associated with the dom changing
[17:22:56] <antarrah> taplar: this works but only after the first click https://bpaste.net/show/076a8ce896b9
[17:23:38] <taplar> yep
[17:24:23] <antarrah> I refuse to believe there isn't a solution :D
[17:24:27] <sigdk> taplar, I used $.when to make sure both have finished. This is really good
[17:24:43] <taplar> $.when does not guarentee order
[17:25:09] <taplar> when delays the following then() until all of them are done, but not in order
[17:25:35] <sigdk> $.when(f1(), f2()).then( doSthThatHasToWaiTForF1AndF2() );
[17:25:54] <taplar> yep, so so long as f2 doesn't have to wait on f1, your good
[17:26:22] <sigdk> I'm just thinking a bit how to handle the fail cases
[17:26:50] <taplar> antarrah: up to you man.  like i said, there is no dom event for dom changes.  which is why mutation observers are being developed but are not widely adopted yet
[17:27:26] <antarrah> taplar: I see, thanks for the clarification
[17:33:29] <taplar> i take that back.  looks like mutation observers have support in the latest browser versions
[17:42:36] <Shadouts> use $.get with callback function, statements inside callback run out of order. Isn't the callback supposed to wait until all data from the AJAX call has been retrieved?
[17:43:24] <taplar> Shadouts: what are you doing?
[17:45:29] <Shadouts> taplar: $.get('/path/to/php', function (data) {$('#').append(objA);$('#').append(objB);}, 'json');
[17:45:57] <Shadouts> it's appending objB before A
[17:46:23] <taplar> $('#') isn't valid ...
[17:46:30] <shoky> what makes you say that
[17:46:36] <shoky> not taplar
[17:46:40] <Shadouts> I'm just keeping things short here '#id' if you will
[17:47:06] <taplar> so yeah, why do you thing it's not in order?
[17:47:50] <Shadouts> taplar: because I've codded it to append data.objA statement before data.objB but it's appending data.objB first.
[17:48:08] <shoky> you've just repeated yourself instead of answering the question
[17:49:23] <Shadouts> because the html inside of the div '#id' that is represented by the objects is being appended in the wrong order.
[17:49:57] <shoky> the appends are happening in the order you coded them, something else is going on
[17:50:15] <taplar> are you sure objA and objB are what you think they are?
[17:50:17] <shoky> and you still haven't really answered our question.. what do you see that makes you say it's the wrong order
[17:51:37] <Shadouts> okay, My actual scenario is three appends of concatenated strings. Does that change things?
[17:51:52] <shoky> probably? we can't know without seeing your code
[17:52:48] <antarrah> taplar: Do you think I can solve my issue by using MutationObserver with its web components polyfill or that won't work without coming from jQ itself?
[17:53:18] <taplar> MO's are outside of jQuery
[17:53:44] <taplar> probably a better question for ##javascript
[17:55:34] <taplar> but like i said, the best solution is to do the initialization in the logic that is creating the new elements
[18:02:04] <Shadouts> taplar: Here I've reverted the code back to what didn't work: https://jsfiddle.net/fLtr05sg/
[18:02:32] <taplar> heh, ok, so here's the problem
[18:02:37] <taplar> append() does not append text
[18:02:45] <taplar> it appends dom elements
[18:03:00] <Shadouts> okay, so it's closing the <a> first?
[18:03:00] <taplar> when you append ln 7, it's self closing that element
[18:03:07] <taplar> yes, cause it's creating an element
[18:03:52] <taplar> concat all those strings and send that whole thing to append
[18:04:17] <Shadouts> that's what I ended up doing, it's just not as easily readable
[18:04:24] <taplar> oh and pull your gallery lookup out of the loop
[18:18:58] <taplar> Shadouts: another option https://jsfiddle.net/fLtr05sg/2/
[18:21:28] <ExeciN> I'm populating a div with buttons and then I want to duplicate the clicked button in another div. This is what I thought of doing https://jsfiddle.net/04fmqnk0/1/ the problem is that the button is moved from one div to the other. How could I make this work?
[18:22:04] <taplar> clone() it
[18:22:44] <ExeciN> taplar: wow, great! thanks
[18:22:47] <taplar> also ln 11-13 your doing $(this) three times
[18:22:59] <taplar> maybe store that in a var, ;)
[18:26:21] <ExeciN> taplar: thanks. here it is working as it should https://jsfiddle.net/04fmqnk0/2/
[18:26:43] <robertmaxrees> ExeciN btw what version of jquery are you using?
[18:27:01] <ExeciN> the latest 3
[18:27:08] <robertmaxrees> Use .on() for bindings then.
[18:27:21] <ExeciN> robertmaxrees: check the commented out part of the code
[18:27:32] <robertmaxrees> Okay?
[18:27:37] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change my suggestion.
[18:27:39] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:28:11] <robertmaxrees> you mean because you need a delegated listener?
[18:28:36] <ExeciN> I had a problem before where $.getJSON was still running and there was no buttons to bind ot
[18:28:39] <ExeciN> *to
[18:28:53] <robertmaxrees> right - .on() hjas a delegated syntax.
[18:28:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/04fmqnk0/3/
[18:29:11] <robertmaxrees> .delegate was (finally) deprecated in 3.0
[18:29:17] <ExeciN> oh ok
[18:29:17] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.delegate
[18:29:27] <taplar> the magical delegate method
[18:29:42] <robertmaxrees> these days yeah.
[18:29:48] <robertmaxrees> iirc that wasn't the way it used to work.
[18:30:43] <taplar> also, as an option, you could make your selector be 'button:not(.active)' to cut down on some of your handler logic
[18:32:35] <ExeciN> lets assume I keep the condition as it was. did I have too many parenthesis?
[18:32:48] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[18:33:14] <robertmaxrees> oh - !(thisButton.hasClass("active")) this is a little weird yeah.
[18:33:15] <taplar> my suggestion was just about using existing boilerplate to cut down on your logic
[18:33:18] <robertmaxrees> !thisButton.hasClass("active")
[18:33:57] <robertmaxrees> since thisButton.hasClass("active") doesn't need to really be evaluated in any special way.
[18:34:18] <ExeciN> I find myself putting too much parenthesis all the time
[18:34:30] <taplar> you just like to hug your code
[18:34:38] <ExeciN> I like to feel safe
[18:34:47] <robertmaxrees> like - logically grouping stuff is a great time to do it.
[18:35:08] <ExeciN> taplar: but yeah your version looks more sexy
[18:35:23] <taplar> first time i've heard that
[18:36:27] <taplar> they call me the man. *wink* atee
[18:40:23] <taplar> i think the 'v' on my keyboard is going out...
[18:42:37] <taplar> first world problems man
[18:42:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:54:25] <sigdk> are jquery libraries backwards compatible or should I worry upon upgrade?
[18:54:43] * taplar dives out the window
[18:55:11] <sigdk> :/
[18:57:02] <ExeciN> this piece of code work fine when I have it in jsfiddle but it doesn't work on my page. Firefox complains with "SyntaxError: missing ) after condition  upload.js:21:18"
[18:57:11] <ExeciN> *works
[19:00:19] <ExeciN> what could be the problem?
[19:06:16] <ExeciN> oh, I forgot the actual file https://gist.github.com/anonymous/341797250fc9e47227f43ff6727aa23b
[19:17:44] <sigdk> ExeciN, well, syntactically this file looks good (no missing parenthesis)
[19:18:32] <sigdk> is this line OK: if (thisButton:not(.active)) {   ? I'm not experienced with js
[19:39:00] <robertmaxrees> sigdk did you figure out your question about plugins?
[19:39:09] <realisation> can jquery detect when there is a mouseover that is dragging a file?
[19:39:26] <robertmaxrees> realisation maybe - what're you trying to build?
[19:39:26] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, nope
[19:40:02] <realisation> I have a dropzone uploader that I want to place in the same area as an image manipulator
[19:40:07] <robertmaxrees> sigdk you cannot guarantee that they'll always work - methods get deprecated and behavior changes.
[19:40:09] <realisation> like for cropping
[19:40:26] <robertmaxrees> you can try, but they won't always work.
[19:40:35] <realisation> I thought the easiest solution would be to change the z-index on mouseover with a file
[19:40:50] <robertmaxrees> so you want drag n drop with an image editor?
[19:41:05] <realisation> mmmhm
[19:41:07] <realisation> that would be real nice
[19:41:32] <robertmaxrees> what plugin are you using for editing?
[19:41:58] <realisation> a react wrapper for something more basic let me check
[19:42:55] <robertmaxrees> depending on how it works, you might just write a handler that does everything for you.
[19:43:05] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to do some weird magic on mouseenter
[19:43:23] <realisation> it's cropper js. I'm noticing the z-index seems to decide which one is active if its the dropzone or the cropper
[19:43:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not what you want to do.
[19:44:28] <robertmaxrees> what drag and drop uploader are you using?
[19:44:31] <realisation> hmmm icic. it sounds like this would entail altering the code of these packages
[19:44:38] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:44:39] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[19:44:41] <realisation> react-dropzone
[19:44:57] <robertmaxrees> so wait are you using jquery at all?
[19:45:09] <SlizardWizard> I have a div which has a bunch of inputs and a child div with the class .disabled, the div.disabled also has inputs
[19:45:22] <realisation> it's present in the page so I can use it if I want to
[19:45:34] <realisation> I thought that would be the quickest solution if I could detect the type of mouseover
[19:45:44] <SlizardWizard> How could i select all inputs excluding the div.disabled > input
[19:45:57] <robertmaxrees> realisation heh - you really want to use react for all your bindings.
[19:46:13] <SlizardWizard> i also can't just do div > input, because some of the inputs i want to select also are apart of a div
[19:46:15] <realisation> interesting, as in bare javascript?
[19:46:20] <robertmaxrees> as in react.
[19:46:31] <robertmaxrees> SlizardWizard gotta fiddle?
[19:46:32] <realisation> right - can you elaborate?
[19:46:39] <robertmaxrees> 'cause there are a few ways to do thgis.
[19:47:15] <robertmaxrees> realisation looks like your upload dealio has a callback for accepted files - you can use that to create your cropper.js instance.
[19:47:28] <SlizardWizard> robertmaxrees: I could try mock one up
[19:47:32] <SlizardWizard> give me a couple minutes
[19:47:35] <robertmaxrees> SlizardWizard rad
[19:48:05] <realisation> right, I was unsure of how to tackle this and I just looked for some wholesale components
[19:48:18] <robertmaxrees> realisation somebody out there may have created one.
[19:48:22] <realisation> I can use cropperjs directly
[19:48:27] <robertmaxrees> but if you're stuck with the two you've got, go that route.
[19:48:48] <robertmaxrees> instead of some kind of setting z-index via js on mouseenter funk.
[19:52:13] <SlizardWizard> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/m63y4ka9/1/
[19:52:26] <SlizardWizard> What i want is a jquery selector to select all the green inputs
[19:52:33] <robertmaxrees> SlizardWizard so what have you tried? :)
[19:53:23] <SlizardWizard> $('input::not(.disabled input))
[19:55:45] <robertmaxrees> so there are a few ways dto do this.  my personal preference is .filter()
[19:55:46] <realisation> if I did it that way, wouldn't I still have a problem if the user wanted to upload another file halfway through?
[19:56:03] <realisation> they should be able to change their mind at any point
[19:56:12] <robertmaxrees> realisation huh?
[19:56:20] <robertmaxrees> how is that different from your current scenario?
[19:56:45] <SlizardWizard> robertmaxrees: so that basically lets me filter everything again
[19:56:46] <SlizardWizard> ??
[19:56:58] <robertmaxrees> let me show you what i mean.
[19:57:06] <realisation> it seems like it's the same
[19:57:07] <realisation> what I want to do is have the potential for a newly dropped file at any time
[19:57:19] <robertmaxrees> realisation you should be able to do that.
[19:57:36] <realisation> hmmm icic
[19:57:37] <robertmaxrees> SlizardWizard https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m63y4ka9/2/
[19:58:00] <robertmaxrees> SlizardWizard you can use things like .not() or w/e but .filter() always winds up being way easier imo.
[19:59:02] <SlizardWizard> robertmaxrees: I may of simplified what i wanted a bit too much as well....
[19:59:13] <robertmaxrees> why do you say that?
[19:59:33] <SlizardWizard> give me 2 seconds of what i actually might look like
[20:00:19] <robertmaxrees> try using .filter() and see if you can figure it out, too :)
[20:00:35] <SlizardWizard> https://jsfiddle.net/m63y4ka9/3/
[20:00:56] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[20:01:03] <SlizardWizard> the inputs are generated using a recursive function that duplicates parts of the form
[20:01:13] <robertmaxrees> so https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m63y4ka9/4/?
[20:02:10] <robertmaxrees> so you still want all inputs that aren't a direct discendant of .disabled, right?
[20:02:16] <robertmaxrees> *descendent
[20:02:25] <robertmaxrees> or a descendent, period.
[20:03:09] <SlizardWizard> sort of, i am given a parent div, if the parent div is disabled or if a parent is disabled i want to ignore that
[20:03:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m63y4ka9/5/
[20:03:21] <robertmaxrees> same thing then
[20:04:39] <SlizardWizard> ignore was probably a bad word
[20:04:45] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('.disabled').length; means "give me the number of all ancestor elements with the class ".disabled""
[20:04:58] <robertmaxrees> so what's wrong with that last example.
[20:05:04] <SlizardWizard> yeah closest traverses up the whole tree
[20:05:11] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:05:59] <SlizardWizard> and lets say i was given the div on line 18
[20:06:22] <robertmaxrees> right - one of the children of a div with the disabled glass
[20:06:23] <robertmaxrees> *class
[20:06:54] <SlizardWizard> i want it to check from there is anything children divs belong to disabled div, but ignore the ones i was given and everything above it
[20:07:06] <robertmaxrees> huh
[20:07:07] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:07:13] <SlizardWizard> so i want them to be blue, but your code will make them red
[20:07:22] <robertmaxrees> my code?
[20:07:27] <robertmaxrees> my code makes them blue.
[20:07:30] <robertmaxrees> clarify your question pls.
[20:07:31] <SlizardWizard> I am really bad explaining things
[20:07:36] <SlizardWizard> and i fucking hate it
[20:08:26] <robertmaxrees> back up :) so right now all inputs that are NOT ancestors of .disabled are blue.
[20:08:32] <robertmaxrees> what SHOULD be blue?
[20:09:38] <SlizardWizard> yes that is what i want, except you always start at the top of the dom tree
[20:09:50] <robertmaxrees> so what do you want instead?
[20:09:56] <robertmaxrees> are all of these inputs inside of a form?
[20:10:14] <robertmaxrees> or a div or something?
[20:10:44] <SlizardWizard> i want to be able to tell the filter code to start at specific place in the tree and go from there, closest traversess all the way up the tree, but i want it to stop at the parent div that i supply
[20:11:12] <robertmaxrees> you can supply a full selector to .closest()
[20:11:52] <robertmaxrees> like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m63y4ka9/6/
[20:13:54] <SlizardWizard> robertmaxrees: i think that works
[20:14:21] <SlizardWizard> but i don't fully understand it first, so give me a couple seconds to think
[20:14:31] <robertmaxrees> alright :) i can explain if need be.
[20:16:56] <SlizardWizard> yeah i think i understand nwo
[20:17:24] <SlizardWizard> this is what my original code was clone.find('input, select, textarea').removeAttr('Disabled');
[20:17:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, .find() would scope down.
[20:17:52] <robertmaxrees> you can use .find() there, too.
[20:19:53] <SlizardWizard> I am testing it now with my proper stuff, not sure if it will work
[20:26:28] <SlizardWizard> it didn't work and now i just want to die
[20:26:42] <robertmaxrees> mind fleshing out that example a bit?
[20:26:46] <robertmaxrees> or showing the site or something?
[20:27:39] <SlizardWizard> its not live, I could try just copying everything and see if i can get it to show
[20:27:46] <robertmaxrees> sure.
