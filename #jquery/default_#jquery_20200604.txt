[00:55:44] <Cork> V7: 1. you run the code directoy, you don't wait for document loading. so depending on where you run it the dom might not have been created yet
[00:56:10] <Cork> 2. #sidebarToggle is dynamically added, that might also change things
[00:56:23] <Cork> 2. If *
[00:56:59] <Cork> but the fundamental problem is (function($) {})(jquery); instead of jQuery(function($) {});
[05:07:36] <Fouad> hi all
[05:08:30] <Fouad> i have this code
[05:08:33] <Fouad> $(document).ready(function() {
[05:08:33] <Fouad>   if (window.File && window.FileList && window.FileReader) {
[05:08:33] <Fouad>     $("#files").on("change", function(e) {
[05:08:33] <Fouad>       var files = e.target.files,
[05:08:34] <Fouad>         filesLength = files.length;
[05:08:36] <Fouad>       for (var i = 0; i < filesLength; i++) {
[05:08:38] <Fouad>         var f = files[i]
[05:08:40] <Fouad>         var fileReader = new FileReader();
[05:08:42] <Fouad>         fileReader.onload = (function(e) {
[05:08:44] <Cork> don't paste code in the channel...
[05:08:44] <Fouad>           var file = e.target;
[05:08:46] <Fouad>           alert(file[i].index);
[05:08:48] <Fouad>           $("<span class=\"pip\">" +
[05:08:50] <Fouad>             "<img class=\"img-thumbs\" src=\"" + e.target.result + "\" title=\"" + file.name + "\"/>" +
[05:08:52] <Fouad>             "<br/><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"remove\"> Remove image</a>" +
[05:08:54] <Fouad>             "</span>").insertAfter("#files");
[05:08:56] <Fouad>           $(".remove").click(function(){
[05:08:58] <Fouad>             $(this).parent(".pip").remove();
[05:09:00] <Fouad>             
[05:09:02] <Fouad>           });
[05:09:09] <Fouad>           
[05:09:09] <Fouad>         });
[05:09:13] <Fouad>         fileReader.readAsDataURL(f);
[05:09:37] <Fouad>       }
[05:09:37] <Fouad>     });
[05:09:37] <Fouad> i want to remove selected item from files
[05:09:37] <Fouad> thanks you
[06:10:14] <V7> O.O
[06:12:03] <V7> Thank you Cork. I'll check about jQuery prefxes
[06:57:10] <Cork> V7: it isn't prefixes
[06:57:50] <Cork> (function($) {})(jQuery) creates a name scope (anonymous function) and executes it with jQuery as argument so $ = jQuery
[06:58:30] <Cork> V7: $ is normally the same as jQuery so jQuery(function($) {}) does the same thing except it deferres for jquery ready callback
[10:05:45] <V7> Thanks you, though, "it deferres for jquery ready callback", so this means that "(function($) {})(jquery);" and "jQuery(function($) {});" differ?
[10:23:07] <Cork> V7: a lot
[10:23:48] <Cork> (function($) {})(jQuery) i IDENTICAL with var func = function($) {}; func(jQuery);
[10:24:38] <Cork> while jQuery(function($) {}); is the same as var func = function($) {}; jQuery(func);
[10:27:31] <V7> oh
[10:40:44] <V7> What issue might this cause?
[10:40:54] <V7> I mean, an incorrect usage of of these?
[20:33:26] <beshoo> I have this small demo https://www.beshoo.com/howtodo.gif , i want to make same approche in jq - it is a nested tree which created in localstorge - but what is the correct way to create such component duplication ! - is there any plugin which do the same please advice
[21:03:47] <sydbarret> is there a way to pause the console.log ? it prints but it dissapear in chrome dev tools
[21:10:37] <Hoppelhase> You mean like increasing the scrollback buffer?
[21:14:25] <beshoo> I believe he meant if the page refreshed!
[21:16:45] <Hoppelhase> Either way, this doesn't seem like a jQuery issue
[21:17:21] <beshoo> True :)
[21:18:11] <beshoo> Well, I like to be open and help whenever i can. you know in corona time you have to help!
[21:18:47] <beshoo> We all share same corona - so why not share the help when ever we can!
[21:28:35] <Hoppelhase> I didn't meant to say "this is off-topic, go away", it's just this channel is pretty specific in topic and I think there are better places to get help on general browser problems
[21:58:33] <beshoo> +1
[22:36:25] <^amra> is it possible to generate new vars in loop?
[22:36:52] <beshoo> eval
[22:38:52] <^amra> eval?
[22:39:13] <^amra> eval('COUNT_'+pos)
[22:39:15] <^amra> Like this?
[22:40:48] <^amra> 10x
[22:50:24] <beshoo> yes
[22:50:30] <beshoo> eval('COUNT_'+pos)
[22:50:49] <beshoo> but do eval('var COUNT_'+pos+' = 1;')
[22:58:43] <^amra> And is it possible to do teh loop for hash in jq?
[23:00:54] <Hoppelhase> What does that even mean?
[23:03:41] <^amra> generates new vars in loop
[23:05:09] <Hoppelhase> Is this question related to jQuery in any way (given that you are already discussion that in ##js)?
[23:05:24] <Hoppelhase> *discussing
[23:09:04] <^amra> yes
[23:09:13] <^amra> The same principles
[23:09:30] <Hoppelhase> Same as what?
[23:11:32] <^amra> js, jq, coffee
[23:11:36] <^amra> For my task
