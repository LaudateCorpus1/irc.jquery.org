[03:22:38] <pj> Hi, I have an issue that I cannot reproduce in jsfiddle, but the code in question is here: https://jsfiddle.net/0dz9turw/ ...
[03:23:53] <pj> Basically put line one of the js is just setup, lines 2-4 are my actual code in my program.  When I run it in the jsfiddle it does exactly what I would expect, but when the code runs in my program the console log is slightly different: [1,"10477197",{}]
[03:24:10] <pj> ...and it's not setting the data on the element.
[03:36:25] <Cork> pj: check console.log($('[id="OrderID"]').length)
[03:36:36] <Cork> if it is != 1 you have a problem
[03:37:08] <Cork> also $("#OrderID").length will always be 1 (or 0)
[03:37:17] <Cork> as an id can only exist once
[03:39:32] <pj> Cork: I see, I did think it mgiht have been more than one element with the ID but didn't realize that $("#OrderID").length wouldn't show it.
[03:39:35] <pj> I'll check that.
[03:40:59] <Cork> if it is 1, the only thing left i can think of is that the element gets replaced by a parent update or similar (.html())
[03:41:43] <pj> Cork: it is still 1
[03:42:09] <Cork> pj: my recommendation is to:
[03:42:19] <pj> but even if it gets replaced the data should still be set in those few lines of code.
[03:42:26] <pj> set and logged, I mean
[03:42:56] <Cork> 1. where you set the data() value, store the element in a variable (don't use multiple selectors) and directly after check the .data() result
[03:43:14] <Cork> if that doesn't have the data you have something messing with jquery
[03:43:21] * pj nods
[03:43:37] <pj> I'll give that a try.
[03:43:40] <Cork> 2. when that works store the element globally and where you read it check that the selector finds the same element as the stored element
[03:43:57] <Cork> store[0] === $('#OrderID')[0]
[03:44:32] <Cork> that sould tell you what is happening
[03:47:30] <pj> I now have this: https://paste.centos.org/view/d7b096a3 and it's still not showing the data in the console log.
[03:48:33] <Cork> pj: line 3 sould use orderid_el.data()
[03:48:40] <Cork> not $('#OrderID')
[03:48:45] <Cork> for testing
[03:48:50] <pj> oh, ok
[03:49:23] <Cork> cause $() will make a new dom selection, the first one will reference the same element
[03:49:29] <Cork> even if it has gotten removed from the dom
[03:49:39] <pj> still same result
[03:50:14] <Cork> what jquery version?
[03:50:55] <Cork> (console.log(jQuery.fn.jquery)
[03:51:18] <pj> 3.2.1
[03:51:28] <pj> and I tried that version in the fiddle
[03:51:30] <Cork> and it isn't the slim version?
[03:51:39] <pj> just the min
[03:51:48] <Cork> makes no sense...
[03:51:59] <pj> but not slimmed down, I grabbed it myself a while back.
[03:52:01] <pj> I know
[03:52:21] <pj> I'm banging my head over this.
[03:52:41] <pj> maybe I'll try upgrading jquery just to see if it makes a difference.
[03:54:11] <Cork> it shouldn't
[03:55:14] <pj> yeah, but I'm out of ideas, other than to try the uncompressed and trace it out.
[03:57:44] <pj> 3.4.1 doesn't change anything.
[03:57:51] <pj> so yeah, gonna have to trace it out, I think.
[04:06:13] <pj> ok, I found the problem
[04:06:32] <pj> damn cms system was munging the code.
[04:09:34] <pj> Cork: thanks for the help.
[04:11:17] <Cork> pj: ah, np
[11:01:33] <paule32> hello
[11:01:56] <robertmaxrees> yo
[11:02:00] <paule32> i have problem with loading .php content
[11:02:02] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/1QAQNZ5
[11:02:19] <paule32> the code is loading, but it is not display in the div
[11:02:33] <robertmaxrees> are you getting your console log?
[11:02:40] <paule32> yes
[11:03:12] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id=app_p1]').length); <- what is this?
[11:05:16] <paule32> no output
[11:05:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:05:33] <robertmaxrees> even if you put it in your success handler?
[11:05:41] <paule32> yes
[11:05:53] <robertmaxrees> when you say "no output", what do you mean?
[11:06:24] <paule32> alert code display me the source (html)
[11:07:01] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with my question :)
[11:07:27] <paule32> yeah, but the output of your log string does not display in the console
[11:07:42] <paule32> not appear
[11:07:42] <robertmaxrees> are you getting you console.log("geladen"); ?
[11:08:50] <robertmaxrees> since i don't have anything but your ajax handler, it's almost impossible to help.  my guess is that your issue isn't with what's coming back from your server but that you've either got more than one element with that ID, or it doesn't exist at all.
[11:10:07] <paule32> em no
[11:10:11] <paule32> dont display
[11:10:31] <robertmaxrees> "don't display" doesn't mean anything to me since i don't have the page in front of me :)
[11:10:35] <robertmaxrees> can you show the page?
[11:12:56] <paule32> moment please
[11:16:57] <robertmaxrees> and just in case - make sure you send over the html that's getting rendered, not the backend php code :)
[11:17:22] <paule32> sp
[11:17:23] <paule32> so
[11:17:25] <paule32> https://www.kallup.solutions/windows/start.php
[11:19:00] <robertmaxrees> ok...???
[11:19:06] <paule32> no
[11:19:16] <paule32> user: demo
[11:19:21] <paule32> pass: 1234
[11:19:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:20:17] <robertmaxrees> notice how when you click that thing you get an error?
[11:20:28] <paule32> start -> All Programs -> dbase4web
[11:20:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah, already there.
[11:20:44] <robertmaxrees> open your dev tools - when you click that thing you'll get an error.
[11:22:46] <paule32> yeah
[11:22:54] <paule32> php?
[11:22:56] <robertmaxrees> that's your issue.
[11:23:01] <robertmaxrees> no, not php.
[11:23:11] <robertmaxrees> the html that you're outputting is cauing issues with jquery.
[11:23:46] <paule32> where can i find it out? global.js -> app1.php
[11:23:46] <paule32> ?
[11:23:51] <robertmaxrees> find what out?
[11:24:04] <paule32> the mistake, error
[11:24:26] <robertmaxrees> first make sure that markup fragment is valid.
[11:25:19] <paule32> global.js line: 146
[11:25:29] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[11:25:33] <robertmaxrees> that's not your uissue.
[11:27:04] <robertmaxrees> there's something wrong with your html.  fix that.
[11:28:28] <paule32> ha
[11:28:30] <paule32> $('<span>'+nachladen+'</span>').appendTo('#app_p1');
[11:28:35] <paule32> this work partly
[11:28:36] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[11:28:42] <robertmaxrees> fix the html issue.
[11:31:11] <robertmaxrees> oh, dude...
[11:31:15] <robertmaxrees> no script tags
[11:33:40] <paule32> in app1.php?
[11:33:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[11:33:50] <robertmaxrees> you're doing way too much there.
[11:34:00] <robertmaxrees> you really need to get a client-side renderer.
[11:34:09] <robertmaxrees> and then just respond with HTML from your server.
[11:34:59] <paule32> <?php echo "<script..."
[11:35:01] <paule32> ?
[11:35:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:35:28] <robertmaxrees> err, respond with JSON from your server.
[11:35:47] <robertmaxrees> sorry - misspoke.  you want to respond with JSON and then use a rendering engine.
[11:36:43] <paule32> ok, busy some minutes, dinner break ... till then
[11:36:49] <robertmaxrees> lol 'k.
[13:10:32] <paule32> so
[13:10:37] <paule32> ill be back
[13:11:07] <paule32> i try different methods to load "after" load website
[13:11:13] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:11:15] <paule32> <div id="w1000" class="easyui-window" title="Hello" data-options="iconCls:'icon-save'"
[13:11:15] <paule32> style="width:800px;height:610px;left:40px;top:30px;"></div>
[13:11:25] <paule32> this code in the main thread, it work
[13:11:27] <robertmaxrees> don't push HTML from your server.
[13:11:32] <robertmaxrees> lol "main thread"
[13:11:56] <robertmaxrees> either way - don't load html from your server.  use a templating engine.
[13:12:09] <paule32> when i try to load "$("#sel").load ...
[13:12:15] <paule32> it does not load
[13:12:28] <paule32> and dont work
[13:12:28] <robertmaxrees> and again
[13:12:39] <robertmaxrees> are you actually going to listen?
[13:12:49] <robertmaxrees> or are you going to keep ignoring what i'm saying?
[13:12:55] <paule32> no
[13:13:31] <robertmaxrees> lol "no" what?
[13:14:06] <paule32> i would simple load an html/php file, with no functions into, only plain text/html
[13:14:11] <paule32> and it don't work
[13:14:20] <robertmaxrees> and what i'm saying is that you shouldn't do that.
[13:14:21] <paule32> my server is localhost file a.t.m
[13:14:35] <paule32> script tag's ?
[13:14:42] <robertmaxrees> again
[13:14:48] <robertmaxrees> serve up JSON, render client-side.
[13:14:56] <robertmaxrees> and you'll save a whole lot of headaches.
[13:15:39] <paule32> and i say again: ajax, load, get don't work
[13:15:43] <paule32> on my side
[13:15:46] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening.
[13:16:02] <paule32> yes, json
[13:16:07] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:16:16] <paule32> but i have to make a request before
[13:16:30] <robertmaxrees> right now, your issue is the markup you're sending to the browser is causing jquery to error out.
[13:16:59] <robertmaxrees> so send json instead and render client-side.
[13:17:15] <robertmaxrees> if you keep trying to do what you're doing now, it'll keep failing.
[13:17:26] <paule32> ok
[13:17:27] <robertmaxrees> the AJAX call itself was working correctly last i looked.
[13:17:31] <robertmaxrees> ajax isn't the issue.
[13:17:37] <robertmaxrees> what you're sending from the server is.
[16:15:24] <paule32> hello
[16:15:38] <paule32> i have problem with ajax xhtmlrequest load get
[16:16:17] <paule32> the problem is: when i use static data (one website call), i get the right result (css )
[16:16:55] <paule32> but, when i do the same thing (outsource code to dynamic load it at later time, i fail
[16:17:08] <paule32> only the plain text will be display
[16:17:26] <paule32> i check webconsole devtools, the code is added properly
[16:18:04] <paule32> so, what can i do?
[22:01:34] <paule32> hello
[22:01:42] <paule32> i have problem with "click"
