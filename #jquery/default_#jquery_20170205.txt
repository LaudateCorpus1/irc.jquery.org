[03:12:59] <jango5481> Hello, I'm trying to write JS code that will loop all iframes in my page and replace them with a div, but I can't find a way to access the parent to change its inner html code? http://pastebin.com/8efpuJz2
[09:54:57] <TubbyTommy> jQuery.Mobile from 1.3.1 to 1.4.5 breaks my .js file, the .button() functionality changes I guess.
[10:03:19] <TubbyTommy> I think it has something to do with blockMouseTriggers being set but I'm not sure why that's set to begin with.
[10:04:21] <TubbyTommy> No, thats not it
[10:24:12] <TubbyTommy> Who knows about the breaking changes on the .button() event handlers from 1.3.1 to 1.4.5?
[10:32:00] <andrklein> hello :)
[10:32:44] <z1haze> i know this is ridiculously stupid and all.. but i have this: http://dpaste.com/185PDMD adn the first fadeOut doesnt occurr, but the fadeIn()'s do occur and its the same exact selectors.. am i missing something here?
[10:34:54] <shoky> z1haze: how does it fade in if it didn't first fade out?
[10:35:11] <z1haze> display: none first time through
[10:36:00] <shoky> it's visible before?
[10:36:01] <z1haze> im amazed at my level of incompetence on this.. i thought it was because i was drinking yesterday but today still.. it looks good to me
[10:36:13] <shoky> probably just a css issue
[10:36:20] <z1haze> it's a form response container
[10:36:28] <z1haze> so its display: none by default
[10:36:41] <z1haze> after the form is submitted, it shows the message fail/success
[10:37:06] <z1haze> but if its a fail, i want to fade out the message when they resubmit because in the case they correct their mistake, it shows both, the success and error
[10:37:19] <z1haze> this is the most trivial thing ever.. but its just not working
[10:40:36] <shoky> z1haze: oh :)
[10:40:53] <shoky> z1haze: $form.closest('.content')   vs  $form.closest('.contact')
[10:41:10] <andrklein> lol
[10:41:21] <z1haze> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[10:41:23] <z1haze> lol
[10:41:41] <andrklein> tunnel view you got there :D
[10:41:44] <z1haze> thanks :\
[10:41:46] <andrklein> working to many hours *gg
[10:41:53] <z1haze> i suppose
[10:43:02] <TubbyTommy> Anybody finding buttons broken in jquery.mobile 1.4.5? Working in 1.31, broken in 1.4.5
[10:49:17] <TubbyTommy> Does bootstrap depend on anything jquery or is it just JavaScript?
[11:25:41] <TubbyTommy> I have an <input type="number"> and jQuery says it must be a whole number, how do I tell jQuery everything is okay?
[11:27:56] <TubbyTommy> Or better yet, how could I take the input out of jQuery's validation scope all together?
[11:55:47] <katten11> loooking at this tutorial: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/ajax-jquery-get.htm. how would i modify to get 3 diffirent names at the same time, and to put thoes name in induvudiual divs
[12:09:42] <katten11>  $.get( "test.php", function( data ) {   Can i look for specific string in data at this point? });
[12:10:39] <katten11> lets say data contains 3 diffirent names. can i search for and output a one of the names
[12:50:14] <TubbyTommy> How do I get jQuery to accept a rational number on a form submission?
[13:07:17] <TubbyTommy> Where can I download the jQuery /images ? They didn't come with my download the .js file it seems
[15:41:52] <TubbyTommy> Hello?
[15:42:13] <TubbyTommy> this channel is dead
[16:02:46] <skypce> hi all
[16:03:04] <skypce> i have a problem , cloning and insert the second element the first works great: http://pastebin.com/4yqG38D0
[16:03:10] <skypce> some idea?
[16:08:46] <shoky> skypce: you're only cloning it once..
[16:10:08] <shoky> the 2nd .insertAfter will remove and re-insert the same clone
[16:11:19] <skypce> like this shoky: http://pastebin.com/a1tXCeTk
[16:11:59] <skypce> not working too
[16:12:00] <skypce> :S
[16:14:03] <shoky> skypce then you got something else wrong. maybe bad selector who knows
[16:46:26] <kas84> Hi!
[16:48:18] <kas84> could anybody tell me why the focus is not working for me in this example?
[16:48:19] <kas84> https://plnkr.co/edit/GxoVAytRWylHRUA8vFOu
[16:49:25] <kas84> I am doing $(“input”).focus() on document ready but it’s not focusing
[16:49:58] <kas84> I also tried $(“#myId).focus() but it’s not working either
[17:00:17] <Sllollaryee> the way you include your jquery seems kinda questionable
[17:00:24] <Sllollaryee> are you sure jquery itself is working in your page?
[17:01:25] <Sllollaryee> yeah your jquery include is broken
[17:01:44] <Sllollaryee> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[17:01:58] <Sllollaryee> if you put this on a seperate line jquery is working
[17:02:34] <Sllollaryee> line #8 should look like this:
[17:02:35] <Sllollaryee>     <script data-require="jquery" data-semver="3.1.1" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[17:04:14] <Sllollaryee> it also fixes the focus you added in your script
[17:10:05] <Sllollaryee> @kas84
[17:10:48] <kas84> ok! thanks!
[19:26:42] <Gsham> im doing an if state like if( ! $('.facetwp-type-checkboxes').length ){ how do i get $this
