[00:00:48] <seba4> someone knows why this code..
[00:00:49] <seba4> https://gist.github.com/4528513
[00:01:01] <seba4> on click needs 2 clicks to react on reload
[00:01:39] <seba4> on load  first time i need to press that button 2 times.. but the second time alert is already open then it works in 1 click
[00:08:34] <marcules> Oh god, what an awful snowy morning >.>
[00:09:04] <rakl> browser compatibility tip of the day: chrome will not care if you wrap <a> with <button>. Firefox will ignore the entire <button></button>. IE will render the <button> but not the <a> inside
[00:09:59] <mindis|wurk> i don't know why i'd want to wrap <a> with a button
[00:11:01] <marcules> Doubleclick!11 :D
[00:31:58] <xaver> good morning :)
[00:33:16] <xaver> i have a problem with a "construct" here and i want to overwrite a function from jquery-ui. I found a lot of examples, but it is the function isLocal form tabs and it is in undefined area. How can i overwrite it?
[00:46:29] <Aqeel> what is the default cursor html code if there is any, ...
[00:47:00] <Aqeel> does it even exist??
[00:47:34] <marcules> auto I guess
[00:47:45] <marcules> Or default
[00:48:24] <marcules> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/cursor @aqueel
[00:48:29] <marcules> -u
[00:48:35] <Aqeel> the html like âˆƒ 	&#8707; 	&exist; 	exists...
[00:49:11] <mindis|wurk> is cursor even the right word you're looking for?
[00:49:22] <marcules> Aahhhh
[00:49:26] <marcules> The blinking console thingy
[00:49:28] <marcules> No idea

[01:13:06] <aghouseh> can anyone suggest a localstorage wrapper or any sort of client-side js caching solution?
[01:13:51] <Aqeel> all sorts of arrow are tehre but no mouse default arrow
[01:13:56] <Aqeel> there*
[01:24:30] <Nebros> hi all
[01:26:18] <marcules> Aqeel, I'm confused - if you mean the mouse pointer - of course it's not, it's no html element, there shouldn't be any representation for it other than as an event
[01:26:48] <Aqeel> i mean relevant shape
[01:26:57] <Aqeel> resembles mouse
[01:27:42] <Aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html if you see all buttons, there is not a single image file
[01:28:51] <Nebros> i have a formular with textfield list. now i will send the formular with doubleclick on the selected line and not with the send button. is there a jquery function for this? ^^
[01:29:22] <Anticom> morning
[01:30:56] <Anticom> what's the difference between .get() and .toArray() ?
[01:38:39] <Nebros> sry i mean select list and not textfield list... ^^
[01:55:01] <rvsjoen> shouldnt $("#foo").add('div'); add an element to a container with id "foo" ? am I seriously misunderstanding something ?
[01:55:22] <kerozene> <div>
[02:00:43] <sahbeewah> rvsjoen, you're looking for .append() / .prepend()
[02:02:06] <sahbeewah> .add() adds to the selected elements... i.e. $('#foo').add('div') is functionally equivalent to $('#foo, div')
[02:10:13] <rvsjoen> ah
[02:10:16] <rvsjoen> well that makes sense
[02:10:18] <rvsjoen> thanks
[02:11:00] <kerozene> and, I think it bears repeating:
[02:11:04] <kerozene> <div>
[02:11:36] <rvsjoen> yeh
[02:11:46] <johnline> so many bears
[02:14:25] <kerozene> my god.. it's full of bears
[02:26:37] <kumavis> i have a form that I am appending additional textareas into via jquery. when i serialize the form, the added elements are not included. the added elements have the same name as the existing elements
[02:32:55] <Anticom2> kumavis fiddle?
[02:34:13] <dashavoo> Hey. I am trying to localise an inline datepicker widget, but the localisations only seem to be set once I have already interacted with the widget (clicked on a date, changed months, etc.). What am I doing wrong?
[02:34:31] <Cork> kumavis: if you're serializing by name selector ex $('input') it won't catch the new input fields if you store it in a variable before the addition
[02:34:46] <Cork> kumavis: best solution is to serialize from the form element instead
[02:35:08] <kumavis> cork I am, and thats not including the newly inserted elements for some reason
[02:35:21] <Cork> ?p
[02:35:21] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:37:56] <seutje> kumavis: if they have the same name, wouldn't they occupy the same key as well?
[02:38:32] <Cork> i took for granted that that was what wasn't happening
[02:39:00] <seutje> hm actually, I am getting both values http://jsfiddle.net/9DY5R/
[02:39:27] <Cork> ah, ya the merge happens server side
[02:39:30] <seutje> not sure how that could ever work reading them out though
[02:39:31] <Cork> sofgot that
[02:39:39] <Cork> *forgot
[02:39:46] <Cork> it depends on the server implementation
[02:39:50] <seutje> u can sofgot it, I won't judge
[02:39:59] <Cork> php and ruby can't handle it
[02:40:09] <Cork> but many other languages can
[02:40:41] <seutje> I thought multiple inputs with the same name was only allowed for radios
[02:40:50] <Cork> no
[02:41:02] <Cork> when theres more then one value the last one overwrites the first one
[02:41:09] <Cork> its actually expected
[02:41:19] <Cork> and commonly used when you have checkboxes
[02:41:36] <seutje> still consulting the spec :P
[02:41:42] <seutje> sry if I don't take ur word for it
[02:41:53] <Cork> <input type="hidden" name="enable" value="0"><input type="checkbox" name="enable" value="1">
[02:42:20] <Cork> that will send ?enable=0 if the checkbox isn't checked and ?enable=0&enable=1 if it is
[02:42:56] <Cork> (else it would be kinda hard to make checkboxes work well)
[02:44:54] <seutje> yeah, guess ur right, although spec only mentions non-unique name attributes for checkboxes and radios only
[02:45:21] * Cork nods
[02:45:31] <seutje> to amke checkboxes behave like multiselect I suppose
[02:45:37] <seutje> make*
[02:48:11] <the_kick> hi
[02:48:56] <kumavis> o gawd. my form open tag was one div in from my form close tag
[02:49:23] <seutje> heh
[02:49:33] <the_kick> if i have an event for a click on say, a.class , can i override it by having an event on a.class.anotherclass
[02:49:38] <seutje> validation: it isn't entirely worthless just yet
[02:49:48] <kumavis> i would flip this table if i had any energy left in me
[02:49:51] <the_kick> and will i get 'event bubbling'?
[02:51:08] <seutje> the_kick: having an even u bind after another cancel the first requires u to splice it into the array and then have that handler call stopImmediatePropagation on the event object
[02:51:38] <the_kick> seutje: i didnt make myself clear
[02:52:50] <the_kick> i have an event that triggers on the $('a.class').click(), but i want another event somewhere else to add another class to that a tag, so the link will be a.class.class2
[02:53:12] <the_kick> so then clicking the same link will have a different effect
[02:53:45] <the_kick> but i dont want the initial 'broader' selector to trigger the initial event.
[02:53:47] <the_kick> make sense?
[02:54:15] <seutje> the_kick: so if u click it it should do X unless it also has a certain class?
[02:54:22] <the_kick> yes exactly ut
[02:54:23] <the_kick> it
[02:54:29] <seutje> make a switch in the handler?
[02:54:35] <the_kick> at which point it will do something else
[02:54:46] <the_kick> ah ok,
[02:55:01] <the_kick> check for the existence of the second class? and keep it to one event
[02:55:10] <the_kick> good thinking sir
[02:55:52] <seutje> $('a.class').on('click', function() { var $this = $(this); if ($this.hassClass('otherClass')) { doShit() } else { doOtherShit();} })
[02:55:58] <seutje> or w/e
[02:56:21] <seutje> this prolly doesn't scale very well though
[02:57:01] <seutje> and why the f- do I always type hassClass instead of hasClass?
[02:57:02] <the_kick> seutje: that will work fine in this instance. I'm not thinking with scaling in mind as its a legacy site coming to the end of its sorry life in a couple of month.
[02:57:22] <the_kick> thank goodness!
[02:57:48] <seutje> .hassClass('The Hoff')
[02:58:04] <the_kick> it started life as a Rembrant, now it looks like a Tracy Emming
[02:58:41] <NeedSomeHelp> Hi, how do I write a function like $("path/to/file.php").ready(function(){alert("hello");}); ?
[02:59:01] <NeedSomeHelp> I want to call a function when a specified page is ready
[02:59:02] <the_kick> seutje:  you forgot to add  if(!hassle){}
[02:59:28] <seutje> ?ajax @ NeedSomeHelp
[02:59:29] <bot-t> NeedSomeHelp, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[03:07:54] <NeedSomeHelp> seutje: I tried this, but that was not working http://pastie.org/5682284. Problem is that it was triggered on any page load, not just at the specified url.
[03:08:19] <seutje> wait what?
[03:08:40] <seutje> NeedSomeHelp: u want it to alert something on that page only, not when loading that page from another page?
[03:09:26] <seutje> $(window).load(function() { if (window.location == 'some url') { alert('awkward'); } }); then?
[03:09:43] <seutje> might be more interesting to only load ur script on that page instead though
[03:10:58] <seutje> also might be interesting to only check window.location.pathname and not the entire locaiton
[03:11:01] <seutje> location even
[03:11:22] <NeedSomeHelp> thanks, that worked. Yes I considered only loading it on the specific page, but I am loading all .js files in the footer, which is a common file for all pages
[03:12:49] <NeedSomeHelp> windows.location.path did not work
[03:20:40] <seutje> NeedSomeHelp: yeah, try pathname
[03:21:08] <seutje> NeedSomeHelp: you can inspect the location object by passing it to console.log and checking the JS console (in a decent browser that is)
[03:24:44] <vaibhavjain> I have 2 select box, country and zones, I am fetching zones values via ajax, when country is changed. I want for a country if the zones have been populated already, no ajax should be fired. - My code here - http://pastebin.com/A52BQ8Yr  Please help !!!

[03:26:48] <Doumie> i got 1 million objects, how to handle them so browser wouldn't crash the crap out of itself
[03:26:49] <vaibhavjain> NodeX : Can jquery once plugin be of any help here ?
[03:27:25] <Doumie> i was thinking about holding them in localStorage
[03:27:28] <NodeX> why would you want to load a whole plugin just for a simple task?
[03:27:47] <NodeX> Doumie : do NOT hold them in local storage - it will chew memory to pieces
[03:27:51] <Doumie> but there's 2 problems : localStorage has a limit from 2.5MB to 5MB which isn't really enough to keep 1 million objects
[03:28:02] <Doumie> but where or how could i hold them?
[03:28:24] <nevvermind1> hi, guys. one bit i don't understand. in the "noConflict() tutorial" in the jQuery website, there's one alternative: http://jsfiddle.net/UxudN/
[03:28:24] <nevvermind1> Once you call noConflict(), $ becomes that of prototype's. But in the ready callback, the $ is actually jQuery's. how come?
[03:28:26] <Doumie> if i just put them into an array... it'll still be slow even if I access the array just by indexes and never looping it thru
[03:28:50] <vaibhavjain> NodeX - actually correct ..  this sounds to be easy, and should be good. I just found jquery once googling it.
[03:28:58] <Doumie> I don't need those 1 million objects all at the same time
[03:29:09] <vaibhavjain> NodeX : BTW, what is the use of jquery once
[03:29:12] <Doumie> BUT in the big picture I need them to be around so I could get them if needed
[03:29:51] <Doumie> I thought that I could build a PHP or nodejs back-end which would hold them in servers memory / in database
[03:29:53] <NodeX> nevvermind1 : you can just assign somehting to noConflict like this ... var $j=jQuery.noConflict();
[03:30:00] <Doumie> and I could get the objects from there...
[03:30:03] <NodeX> then $j = jquery and $ = prototype
[03:30:09] <mindis|wurk> ugh. i'm so frustrated with this problem. i have an element with a certain width and it has child elements with fixed top and height. i need the child elements to fill the parent element horizontally without overlapping with each other. i just don't know how to calculate optimal width and left values for them
[03:30:17] <NodeX> vaibhavjain : I dont have a clue
[03:30:28] <Doumie> but that'll lose offline part...whici really isnt THAT big of a problem, but I'd just like to know my options
[03:30:29] <nevvermind1> i know, but i was wondering how come the gloabl $ is prototype's, but injected, is jquery's
[03:30:38] <vaibhavjain> NodeX : Thanks man, this did work, Thanks for your time :)
[03:30:40] <NodeX> Doumie : store them on the server
[03:30:43] <NodeX> ;)
[03:31:09] <Doumie> i thought maybe there's a way to generate and hold each object seperatly
[03:31:18] <Doumie> so they wouldn't be in a big array
[03:31:20] <Doumie> just one by one
[03:31:27] <NodeX> nevvermind1 : jquery is loaded after prototype and ergo is evaluated last which overwrites the $
[03:31:32] <Doumie> but i'm not figuring out how could i do that...
[03:31:42] <Doumie> i mean sure, i just generate them and don't put them anywhere
[03:31:46] <Doumie> but how do i access them later on?
[03:32:20] <NodeX> I cannot advise on something that will chew memory and kill performance sorry
[03:32:54] <Doumie> everything you do in JS chews memory and kills performance, might think you're in a wrong channel ;p
[03:33:43] <Doumie> so I really can't hope that there is actually a way to make browser scope with 1 million javascript objects without crashing?
[03:33:51] <Doumie> cope*
[03:34:09] <NodeX> yes I agree you're in the wrong channel ;)
[03:34:27] <nevvermind1> NodeX: http://jsfiddle.net/UxudN/1/ ; this is what I'm referring to
[03:34:38] <Doumie> i might be... ;p
[03:35:26] <Doumie> alright
[03:35:29] <NodeX> nevvermind1 : it's not reverted back because it's already overwritten
[03:35:31] <Doumie> i'll take sockets and nodejs
[03:35:36] <Doumie> that might be fast enough
[03:35:42] <NodeX> you need to load jquery first, then call noConflist
[03:36:15] <NodeX> then load prototype
[03:36:38] <NodeX> as a side line ... why are you loading both, jquery can do everything that prototype can do plus more
[03:37:30] <nevvermind1> experimenting noConflict() stuff (magento)
[03:37:41] <nevvermind1> NodeX: i think i know what you mean thou
[03:38:56] <NodeX> eww magento :/
[03:40:56] <mr_daniel> When I hold the slider and move the mouse over other elements or even leave the browser viewport at all, no elements get selected. How is this achieved? Here is a simple fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/T2tYH/
[03:41:13] <mr_daniel> You can select both <p> elements. But when you hold the slider, the <p> elements get *not* selected, which is good. But how is this achieved? I am coding something and want this feature for code as well.
[03:45:08] <negev> is there a way i can stop this returning a blank string in the array if the input has no content?  $('#element').text().split(/,\s*/);
[03:45:16] <negev> currently i get [""]
[03:45:19] <negev> which is annoying
[03:46:15] <NodeX> not without an if
[03:46:20] <negev> booo
[03:59:25] <nevvermind1> NodeX: care to have another look? http://jsfiddle.net/UxudN/2/ i still don't get it
[04:12:23] <NodeX> not sure what part of "load jquery first then use noConflict(), then load prototype" is so hard to fathom?

[04:42:25] <Cork> Nancy2012: thats not really something you need a plugin for
[04:42:43] <Nancy2012> Cork: ok.. but i want to the way to make it
[04:43:23] <Cork> Nancy2012: just add it to the page, with display:none; and on change on the select element change it with .hide() or .show based on the select box value
[04:43:59] <Nancy2012> perfect..

[05:08:01] <vnl> anybody around for a quick help
[05:08:04] <vnl> ?
[05:09:36] <seutje> ?ask
[05:09:36] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:11:29] <vnl> was looking for the name of the slider used...here
[05:11:30] <vnl> http://www.scotch-soda.com/campaigns/portraits/
[05:14:31] <aghouseh> thats nice!
[05:14:37] <aghouseh> too bad they didnt use css3 animation tho
[05:14:54] <esk_> the slider seems to be custom built
[05:15:04] <esk_> it's indeed awesome :D
[05:15:23] <seutje> it breaks once u've scrolled past it
[05:15:24] <aghouseh> yeah, animating that much with jquery is rugged though.
[05:15:31] <esk_> and yeah, the animations are a bit jerky
[05:17:41] <vnl> I can see that...but isn't there a simpler slider
[05:17:48] <vnl> full screen version
[05:18:16] <aghouseh> yes lots
[05:18:23] <aghouseh> ive used vegas with great success
[05:18:32] <aghouseh> http://vegas.jaysalvat.com/
[05:19:10] <vnl> Thank you for the suggestion...I am building a site...and I am really bad at designs.
[05:19:18] <vnl> for the blog part I used drupal
[05:19:25] <aghouseh> sorry for you.
[05:19:32] <aghouseh> :)
[05:19:51] <vnl> :P
[05:19:59] <vnl> Vegas looks nice
[05:20:36] <aghouseh> yeah its well done
[05:20:49] <aghouseh> straight-forward, nice options and extendable
[05:21:21] <esk_> vegas looks nice :D
[05:23:36] <vnl> but isn't vegas a little heavy
[05:24:01] <vnl> as in the animation would be a tough ask on users with older browsers
[05:24:55] <aghouseh> you can disable the fade i believe
[05:25:03] <aghouseh> and you can also use it to just show an image without a slideshow
[05:25:12] <aghouseh> ive done a lot of custom stuff with it
[05:26:08] <aghouseh> its got a really cool "overlay" function that will insert a "filter" of sorts on top of the images if you wish
[05:26:19] <aghouseh> to sort of obscure the artifacting if you're using lower res imaest
[05:26:21] <aghouseh> images
[05:26:34] <aghouseh> it works nicely actually
[05:36:35] <Guest47702> Hello
[05:37:28] <esk_> howdy
[05:38:06] <Guest47702> I would like to know what script jquerymobile use in doc to hide left menu if width screen is too low ? (example: http://jquerymobile.com/demos//1.2.0/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html)
[05:39:26] <esk_> I think it is not a script, it is responsive web design
[05:40:06] <esk_> You should look up "css media queries"
[05:40:07] <Guest47702> I try to do the same with a floet menu
[05:40:17] <Guest47702> but it doesn't accept max-width :/

[05:45:06] <Hooloovoo> that's a good way to find out
[05:45:55] <masentinel900> neither runns
[05:46:26] <Hooloovoo> ?
[05:46:54] <masentinel900> don't works
[05:47:01] <Hooloovoo> what doesn't work?
[05:47:24] <Hooloovoo> the logging doesn't show anything or the post data is missing?
[05:47:33] <masentinel900> the idea that you have game me
[05:47:36] <masentinel900> gave me
[05:47:52] <Hooloovoo> in your controller
[05:47:56] <masentinel900> yes.
[05:48:06] <Hooloovoo> put var_dump($this->input->post());exit;
[05:48:17] <Hooloovoo> and check the response
[05:49:41] <masentinel900> bool(false)
[05:49:55] <shoky> you're sending the data fine according to that jquery snippet
[05:50:05] <Anticom2> wtf
[05:50:55] <the_kick> hmm, if i bind fancybox() to an element with say $(.mainclass) as well as $(.mainclass .secondclass) , wil li have to unbind it from both?
[05:51:06] <Anticom2> thought this was #jq
[05:51:11] <Anticom2> :P
[05:51:13] <the_kick> cos i can get it to unbind
[05:51:35] <the_kick> by can i mean cannot
[05:51:37] <the_kick> :-/
[05:51:46] <chilversc_> the_kick: yup
[05:51:49] <Anticom2> and why can't u?
[05:52:22] <the_kick> i think im only unbinding it from one binding, so to speak
[05:52:32] <chilversc_> the_kick: eg if you had; $('.mainclass').on(...) then $('.mainclass .secondclass').on(..) that's 2 different event handlers
[05:52:33] <Anticom2> wut?!
[05:52:33] <b-ot> if i save vars in a click event and trigger a change event in the click event, can i commit this vars in the change event?
[05:52:43] <Anticom2> ah yea right
[05:52:56] <Anticom2> chilversc_ if it's that what he means
[05:53:17] <masentinel900> The fancybox windows is working ok because in the controller I just echo "hello world"; show ok..
[05:53:22] <the_kick> chilversc thanks
[05:53:29] <Anticom2> b-ot http://www.mredkj.com/tutorials/reference_js_intro_ex.html
[05:53:47] <shoky> wut?!
[05:53:48] <b-ot> How can I replace a php include navigation with jQuery?
[05:58:16] <esk_> you coul include both navigations then just toggle the visibility
[05:59:39] <Nebros> i have here a simple code: http://jsfiddle.net/2CPLP/  i need a function that i can doubleclick a value from list and the form have to send, like send button pressed... can someone help me to expand my code?
[06:00:06] <Anticom2> Nebros what behaviour do you want?
[06:00:08] <Anticom2> didn't get it
[06:00:17] <Anticom2> when somebody double clicks a list item you want to submit that?
[06:00:35] <Anticom2> Nebros can i pm you?
[06:00:40] <Anticom2> i'm german too
[06:01:16] <Nebros> when in list are: Hans Peter Max and i cklick double on Peter, the form have to send Peter...
[06:01:26] <Nebros> yes. :)
[06:05:12] <twoten> hi there!
[06:06:22] <twoten> anyone know of a good image and text scrolling carousel/ticker tape?
[06:09:23] <twoten> 850 people here - can any of you talk?
[06:09:35] <Anticom2> i'm not into carousel plugins
[06:09:45] <Anticom2> but i recomment googleing
[06:10:03] <Anticom2> http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/12/jquery-carousel.html pick one you like
[06:10:10] <twoten> yeah I found a bout 200 and none are easy or suitable
[06:10:16] <masentinel900> Will be because I don't have the serialize() in my script
[06:10:17] <masentinel900> ?
[06:10:18] <the_kick> twoten: not to someone with your attitude :P
[06:10:25] <Anticom2> twoten they never will be "easy"
[06:11:08] <the_kick> im having a real hard time trying to get my fancybox to unbind
[06:11:19] <twoten> well, they actually are easy to install, but hard to style and config,
[06:11:33] <the_kick> ive tried unbindDamnYouUnbind() but that wont work either
[06:11:40] <Anticom2> twoten that's due to the complexity of most plugins of that kind
[06:12:26] <twoten> damn, I was on some site last week and there was a beautiful one, smooth, fully mouse aware, why didn't I make a bookmark?
[06:12:28] <Anticom2> the_kick get firequery, then you can inspect where and what handlers are bind to
[06:13:05] <masentinel900> http://pastebin.com/aMPT1NS2
[06:13:34] <bamarni> with a file input, is it possible to process the image on client side, usually I do it server side once the form is submitted, but I have to post it with ajax and get a thumbnail as soon as the input file is populated.
[06:13:35] <masentinel900> somebody can help me?     :::     I need to serialize() the data
[06:14:38] <bamarni> I can see the FileReader api but apparently it's not compatible with IE, maybe jQuery has an abstract cross-browser way?
[06:15:20] <the_kick> Anticom2: ill check it out thanks, i may be switching back to firefox temporarily then
[06:15:31] <masentinel900> I'm receiving this "bool(false) " when I put a var_dump
[06:16:04] <Anticom2> the_kick no don't do that
[06:16:08] <Anticom2> switch permanently ;D
[06:16:11] <Anticom2> :)
[06:18:44] <masentinel900> somebody know how serialize() an array for to send through of AJAX?
[06:19:43] <Anticom2> JSON.stringify(myArray)
[06:20:04] <Anticom2> but you should be careful with that, since GET params got a very low character limit
[06:20:17] <Anticom2> so if you're trying to send a lot of data through get that might go wrong
[06:20:23] <Anticom2> so i recommend using POST
[06:21:22] <Grundell_> Okay so im new to jQery - but i want to build a validation for an input form, here i want a message to be shown in the input field that wasn't valid, and a red border (css3 box shadow to be show around it)... would prefer if there was a posibility to add like class=requiererd and from there we have the first part so if its not filled in you wont get to post, the handle them idividualy... so for example e
[06:21:22] <Grundell_> mail phone adress and so on... is there a good tutorial och some script that i could work of or something like that out there ?
[06:23:16] <masentinel900> <Anticom2>: Hello, I'm receiving "bool(false) " this, with in my controller I put a var_dump.
[06:23:37] <popof_> has anyone messed with dart2js? is it notably slower than native?
[06:23:46] <popof_> than writing natively I mean
[06:23:52] <masentinel900> I don't know if this could fix it adding a serialize() in the data
[06:27:18] <Anticom2> masentinel900 this is #jquery and not #php... so the question would be what you're submitting
[06:27:27] <Anticom2> provide a fiddle and i'll take a look at it
[06:47:28] <sam17me> hello, what server are we on.
[06:47:58] <popof_> sam17me: ? you're irc.freenode.net
[06:48:05] <shoky> it give eror
[06:48:50] <popof_> sam17me: how exactly do you not know where you joined..? theres also /whoami
[06:49:24] <sam17me> I'm all kinds of new
[06:49:37] <popof_> err
[06:49:43] <popof_> ok... then why ask?
[06:49:59] <sam17me> well, that's how you learn is it not?
[06:50:16] <sam17me> I'm not content to remain ignorant
[06:50:20] <popof_> what have you learned exactly?
[06:50:26] <popof_> that you entered freenode?
[06:50:44] <sam17me> I am on server irc.freenode.net on channel #juery
[06:51:33] <popof_> and this is... learned knowledge..? sorry I just don't follow at all. carry on
[06:51:42] <sam17me> I just didn't know the server address
[06:51:51] <sam17me>  I was going to try a different irc program
[06:51:54] <popof_> then how did yo jon?
[06:51:58] <popof_> join*
[06:52:03] <sam17me>  and I needed to know the exact server address to enter it there
[06:52:33] <sam17me> some browser program
[06:52:39] <popof_> oh
[06:52:50] <sam17me> what are you using for Irc
[06:53:28] <Kasimir> Guys how would I make a fullscreen image that supports IE
[06:53:35] <popof_> Im on mac, so I use colloquy - its nice enough
[06:53:43] <N3X> limechat for me
[06:54:02] <sam17me> I'm using my web browser
[06:54:20] <sam17me>  just exploring different ways to connect
[06:54:22] <popof_> sam17me: also 'tab' is a shortcut for replies or if you type po and then tab it should auto complete to popof_. and /j #jquery is another handy shortcut
[06:54:36] <vladyn> hello everyone
[06:54:45] <N3X> hi
[06:54:59] <Kasimir> Is there an way to use (filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='.myBackground.jpg', sizingMethod='scale');
[06:54:59] <Kasimir> -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='myBackground.jpg', sizingMethod='scale')";) inside javascript style. etc?
[06:55:14] <sam17me> popof_: Thanks
[06:57:06] <fALSO> Hi!
[06:57:20] <fALSO> Anyone knows how to add a new SELECT option to the beggining of the <options>
[06:57:23] <fALSO> via jquery
[06:57:39] <fALSO> add an item before all others that are already defined
[06:58:33] <zulu-gula> is it possible to change background-image to grayscale?
[07:00:55] <fALSO> is it possible ?
[07:01:09] <fALSO> i know its possible to add new <option> AFTER the ones that already exist
[07:01:15] <fALSO> but i want to add BEFORE
[07:05:26] <BLeg> fALSO, You mean you have something like this: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp
[07:05:38] <BLeg> and you want to add a new <option> to it, right?
[07:05:44] <fALSO> yap
[07:05:49] <fALSO> add a new option before VOLVO
[07:05:53] <fALSO> (the first one)
[07:05:59] <fALSO> i want to add a new option to the TOP
[07:06:20] <BLeg> if I can load jsfiddle I'll show you
[07:07:09] <shoky> ?prepend
[07:07:09] <bot-t> .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[07:07:36] <esk_> http://jsfiddle.net/3NJm9/
[07:07:39] <esk_> here's a simple example
[07:07:46] <esk_> prepend adds before, append adds later
[07:07:49] <esk_> after*
[07:07:57] <fALSO> let me check :)
[07:08:04] <BLeg> fALSO, esk_ beat me to it.
[07:08:13] <BLeg> He's correct
[07:09:33] <fALSO> TJANKS
[07:09:35] <fALSO> so much :D
[07:09:54] <masentinel900> Hello again!!
[07:10:00] <esk_> hello
[07:10:04] <esk_> any progress? :)
[07:10:14] <masentinel900> So so
[07:10:37] <masentinel900> I'm getting this " bool[false] "
[07:10:48] <masentinel900> But is not the data
[07:11:53] <masentinel900> Now I want if there the chance of to put some like this :: $("$id_tag").val().serialize();
[07:12:00] <masentinel900> How will be?
[07:12:27] <tlvb> any benefit to doing .on('click', ... instead of .click(... ?
[07:12:52] <esk_> afaik .click() delegates to .on('click' anyway
[07:13:11] <greg5green> only benefit I've really noticed is that if you decided to go with another event later on instead of click, its easier to change
[07:13:17] <esk_> you can always check the code
[07:13:35] <tlvb> greg5green: thanks
[07:17:06] <greg5green> also, it is easier to change to .one() or to use delgated events if you already have .on instead of .click
[07:19:24] <sinclair> hi everyone
[07:19:49] <Guest47702> Thanks esk_ , it was actually css queries ;)
[07:21:24] <rex1> Why doesn't this set the background color to red? Why doesn't it remove the element?
[07:21:28] <rex1> http://jsfiddle.net/cDgQA/
[07:21:48] <rex1> 7 lines of code
[07:22:38] <masentinel900> somebody know why show "  bool[false]   " instead the data.?
[07:24:26] <popof_> masentinel900: what are you even asking...?
[07:25:14] <rex1> How can I use $(this) within a $.post() success handler?
[07:26:05] <rex1> my code  at http://jsfiddle.net/cDgQA/ but I can't use $(this) to remove the element from a $.post sucess handler, why?
[07:27:08] <masentinel900> popof_: I'm sending data with ajax but instead of show me the data that I sent just show me  (bool(false))
[07:27:48] <popof_> masentinel900: no one will be able to help you with that, you're far too vague
[07:28:27] <marcules> rex1, because it is not successful
[07:28:34] <rex1> masentinel900: put your code on Pastebin or jsfiddle
[07:28:49] <marcules> rex1, also you're overwriting your data-object with x
[07:28:50] <Nebros> Anticom2 noch da? ^^
[07:29:05] <NoiseEee> rex1: what marcules just said about overwriting
[07:29:08] <rex1> marcules: it is successful, i put an alert() in the success handler
[07:29:55] <marcules> rex1, you are right, sorry
[07:30:09] <rex1> so why doesn't it work? neither backgroundcolor or parent remove works
[07:30:21] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/w6wZc/
[07:30:30] <Andreas> Anyone familiar with .animate() problems in IE7/8 available?
[07:30:33] <NoiseEee> rex1: what marcules just said about overwriting
[07:30:34] <marcules> http://jsfiddle.net/cDgQA/1/ @rex1
[07:30:39] <esk_> http://jsfiddle.net/cDgQA/2/ @rex1
[07:31:10] <esk_> oh, yeah, and add event.preventDefault() aswel
[07:31:13] <esk_> aswell*
[07:31:34] <marcules> esk_, why does yours remove the element, but mine did not?
[07:31:48] <marcules> AH! $this VS $(this)
[07:31:49] <marcules> >.<
[07:32:07] <esk_> i saved a $(this) reference
[07:32:12] <marcules> Yeah
[07:32:13] <esk_> before any ajax is done
[07:32:17] <marcules> He did too as "x"
[07:32:27] <esk_> and then proceeded to overwrite it :)
[07:32:35] <marcules> Yeah no yeah :D
[07:32:38] <rex1> why add event.preventDefault() ?
[07:32:47] <marcules> The problem is mine calls jQuery(jQuery(this))
[07:32:50] <marcules> Which is silly
[07:32:53] <esk_> yeah that also
[07:33:04] <esk_> rex1: you call that to prevent the link from going through
[07:33:12] <marcules> rex1, to prevent the link from firing href = #
[07:33:13] <esk_> ie. if the href of the link was "#"
[07:33:20] <esk_> it would take you to the top of the page
[07:33:32] <esk_> which is usually undesireable
[07:34:02] <marcules> Nebros, was isch los? :P
[07:34:16] <rex1> i see
[07:34:39] <StephenS> why does this not work http://jsfiddle.net/Au9tc/4/ ?
[07:34:47] <esk_> rex1: run your code through http://www.jshint.com/
[07:34:52] <NodeX> define "not work"
[07:35:00] <rex1> esk_: thanks, i always do :)
[07:35:15] <popof_> masentinel900: you are replacing your 'datos' variable with the returned data in the function(datos) {}
[07:35:21] <NodeX> try binding your on() to body or somehting else
[07:35:25] <esk_> rex1: yay :)
[07:35:28] <popof_> masentinel900: look on line 7 and line 10
[07:35:29] <marcules> $(document).on('click' <<<< srsly?
[07:35:56] <StephenS> why not? :D
[07:35:59] <masentinel900> yes.
[07:36:08] <StephenS> it does not work when I implet it on my web page
[07:36:10] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/Au9tc/373/
[07:36:16] <NodeX> StephenS ^^
[07:36:51] <NodeX> and "it does not work when I implet it on my web page" is very ambiguous
[07:37:29] <marcules> NodeX, it reminds me why I hate people in general :p
[07:37:30] <StephenS> nope still not work on my page
[07:37:43] <esk_> it should be wrapped inside document ready
[07:37:54] <StephenS> maybe my css is broken?
[07:37:55] <popof_> masentinel900: okay... so your wlecome.
[07:37:59] <esk_> $(function(){ //your code here });
[07:38:02] <popof_> you're*
[07:38:07] <StephenS> how come jsrun runs without css and shows button design?
[07:38:23] <esk_> you have selected boostrap on the left
[07:38:26] <Andreas> Anyone familiar with .animate() problems in IE7/8 available?
[07:38:27] <esk_> which is a css framework
[07:38:59] <NodeX> dude, what doesnt work?
[07:39:03] <StephenS> ok how can I get bootrap source code?
[07:39:06] <StephenS> or whatever :D
[07:39:06] <NodeX> "it" IS NOT AN ANSWER
[07:39:24] <StephenS> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/css/bootstrap.css thank you
[07:39:25] <StephenS> :D
[07:39:56] <esk_> bootstrap is far more than buttons :) check out their documentation
[07:40:57] <masentinel900> <popof_>: can you tell me how is the structure of data fro might to send in ajax.
[07:41:08] <masentinel900> so, var datos = {val: $("#button-upload-gen").val()};
[07:41:11] <masentinel900> like this.?
[07:41:19] <popof_> masentinel900: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:42:47] <esk_> !help
[07:42:50] <esk_> or not :D
[07:43:14] <BillCriswell> masentinel900: It would be like [ { name: "Name", value: "Value" } ]. You can do data = $('form').serializeArray(); as well.
[07:44:31] <StephenS> esk_ do I need anything else
[07:44:48] <StephenS> I included http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/css/bootstrap.css and my code and its still not showing background like on jsrun
[07:45:13] <NoiseEee> StephenS: what errors are there in console?  where has debugging led you?
[07:45:20] <masentinel900> <BillCriswell>: is that I'm receiving this  "  bool[false]  "
[07:45:30] <Andreas> Anyone used .animate() (concerning 'left', 'top') in IE7/8 before, while having defined the element's starting-positions before? It's majorly messing up for me
[07:45:46] <rex1> marcules, esk_: thanks for your help! appreciated <3
[07:45:53] <StephenS> NoiseEee, there was no errors
[07:45:55] <marcules> rex1, np :)
[07:46:01] <esk_> rex1 np :D
[07:46:07] <masentinel900> first I'm trying just with a number. so, {val : 5}
[07:47:02] <esk_> StephenS , bootstrap is more than a simple css file, open the http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ site, and check the examples and download the whole package if you wish to use bootstrap
[07:47:11] <StephenS> ah ok thanks
[07:47:51] <BillCriswell> masentinel900: How about data: { name: "Jim" } ?
[07:48:31] <masentinel900> <BillCriswell>: var data = {val : 5};
[07:48:41] <masentinel900> and data : data,
[07:49:04] <BillCriswell> Seems like an error server side
[07:49:04] <BillCriswell> ?
[07:49:25] <esk_> anyone interested in some web app development/git usage practice? i'm pretty new to collborative development and would like some more experience
[07:49:35] <esk_> Also, is there a better channel to ask this?
[07:49:56] <sCoRpi_> esk_ practice sounds good
[07:50:01] <sCoRpi_> i need git practice myself ;)
[07:50:13] <NoiseEee> #git would probably answer your questions about typical setups/requirements etc
[07:50:37] <esk_> It's not the technical side of git, it's the experience i want :)
[07:52:58] <StephenS> esk_ I have downloaded bootstrap but it seems after including js and css stillnot working..?
[07:53:07] <StephenS> I need to includeall files from bootstrap?
[07:53:19] <esk_> hmm, i'm sorry i don't know what the problem is
[07:53:57] <popof_> StephenS: include the appropriate js files as specified by the doc
[07:54:06] <popof_> StephenS: open up the console and see the javascript errors
[07:54:14] <StephenS> I included everything but still not background popup on my web
[07:54:26] <popof_> StephenS: open up the console and see the javascript errors
[07:54:44] <StephenS> there is no js errors
[07:54:58] <popof_> then your fault lies elsewhere
[07:55:20] <StephenS> -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;
[07:55:20] <StephenS> -ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;
[07:55:22] <NoiseEee> StephenS: you've enabled breaking on all errors etc?
[07:55:33] <StephenS> ?
[07:55:36] <StephenS> which console jsrun
[07:55:37] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ StephenS
[07:55:41] <StephenS> or inspect element?
[07:57:05] <Andreas> I begin to get the feeling that I will have to fill a bugreport for .animate()'s behaviour in IE7/IE8 :/
[07:57:24] <StephenS> errors fixeed still nothing
[07:58:10] <NoiseEee> nobody has ESP StephenS
[07:58:23] <NoiseEee> well nobody here as far as i know
[07:58:31] <NoiseEee> you should go through the link I sent you.
[07:59:09] <popof_> "my code doesn't work what do pls advise"
[07:59:12] <StephenS> what css code should be for background popup like that
[08:04:16] <nabr0_> i've got a script that takes the order of a list and reorders it based on a specific order. it works fine if all of the sizes are present but if a size isn't, when creating the new array, if you end up with 0,1,2,3,5,6 only 0-3 output and 5/6 are dropped out of the array
[08:04:21] <nabr0_> http://jsfiddle.net/DUQXg/
[08:04:58] <nabr0_> if you remove say ,data-sortby="s", anything that follows will be removed
[08:05:01] <marcules> btw how's the it world treating you in croatia?
[08:05:04] <nabr0_> not sure how to account for this
[08:05:10] <marcules> esk_,
[08:08:16] <gf3> nabr0_: Have you considered using toArray and then using the array sort methods?
[08:22:17] <rex1> in old query you caught live events with .live() but in new query, you supposed to use .on('click), so how do you catch updated/new DOM elements with new jquery?
[08:24:17] <shoky> rex1: $('#staticContainer').on('click', '.someClass', function()..)
[08:24:42] <shoky> rex1: $(selector).live(type,fn) === $(document).on(type, selector, fn)
[08:25:35] <rindolf> Hi all.
[08:26:15] <zafu> hi, how do I get the contents of 'href' attribute from inside $('#pricetable a[href^="?id_cabin_"]').click() ?
[08:26:42] <shoky> $(this).attr('href')
[08:26:47] <zafu> thanks
[08:27:01] <rex1> ah, its .on('click')
[08:27:36] <rex1> oh yeah, its $(document).on now
[08:27:40] <rindolf> shoky++
[08:36:41] <Nancy2012> how can i fixed this if statement bug..and make it in proper way http://jsfiddle.net/5cZEF/1/
[08:36:44] <Nancy2012> many thanks
[08:39:04] <wumbei> i'm having trouble getting the jquery ui datepicker to select the default date to today. can anyone help?
[08:39:29] <[jmc]> wumbei, isn't that the default?
[08:40:01] <rindolf> wumbei: where's the code?
[08:40:07] <wumbei> [jmc]: it only highlights, not selects
[08:40:08] <rindolf> wumbei: you can jsfiddle.net it.
[08:40:32] <rindolf> Nancy2012: let me see.
[08:40:52] <[jmc]> wumbei, http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-setDate
[08:41:10] <Nancy2012> thanks :)
[08:41:24] <[jmc]> $( '.selector' ).datepicker( 'setDate', Date.now() );
[08:41:26] <rindolf> Nancy2012: http://jsfiddle.net/5cZEF/1/ -  the PHP seems like it will have cross-site scripting attacks.
[08:41:28] <[jmc]> something like this
[08:41:36] <wumbei> perfect
[08:41:41] <wumbei> thank you very very much

[08:42:42] <Nancy2012> i show you
[08:42:44] <Nancy2012> wait..
[08:42:48] <Nancy2012> let me modify something

[08:43:03] <Nancy2012> so u can easily to understand
[08:43:54] <molavy> hi
[08:43:58] <nFFF> Im not sure how this PHP suggests code injection
[08:44:06] <rindolf> molavy: hi.
[08:44:15] <rindolf> nFFF: markup injection.
[08:44:15] <nFFF> it looks like it's server side generated, not inputs from users
[08:44:24] <rindolf> nFFF: OK.
[08:44:26] <molavy>  i have real problem about jquery ui draggable
[08:44:35] <nFFF> common with alot of CMS, the php is used as tempating to genrate HTML code
[08:44:37] <rindolf> molavy: OK.
[08:45:03] <molavy> when i attach draggable to parent of button i can move it
[08:45:08] <systemfault> It's just bad when PHP is used to generate javascript though... ;)
[08:45:24] <molavy> but when i attach it to buttons inside parrent
[08:45:35] <molavy> i can't move them
[08:45:56] <rindolf> nFFF: https://metacpan.org/module/Template::Stash::AutoEscaping - see this.
[08:51:14] <skamikaze> rindolf: I'm with nFFF here - can't see user input..
[08:52:04] <rindolf> skamikaze: well, see http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html
[08:53:43] <skamikaze> rindolf: one id (int) and 2 booleans
[08:54:11] <skamikaze> where's the csrf gate he has to escape?
[08:54:20] <rindolf> skamikaze: XSS - not CSRF.
[08:54:51] <nFFF> rindolf, how does this apply here?
[08:55:00] <skamikaze> s/csrf/xss
[08:55:18] <nFFF> He's simply passing variables from PHP to javascript, variables that are generated server side from the content management sysmte
[08:55:21] <rindolf> nFFF: how does what apply?
[08:55:25] <nFFF> XSS?
[08:55:35] <rindolf> Well, never mind - let's drop it.
[08:55:39] <rindolf> It's off topic  here.
[09:15:13] <foo> I have spent nearly a dozen hours now looking for something like this: http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/scroll/ - but that works horizontally so we can put images of varying width/height in there... but I can't seem to find it for the life of me (is there a reason it's not possible?). I looked into swipe.js, but that swipes at a fixed width. We want it to look more like this (for mobile). Any tips?
[09:17:10] <nFFF> foo 12 hours? cant you just write it yourself?
[09:23:42] <foo> nFFF: uh, no, actually, I never even thought about that. heh
[09:23:52] <foo> nFFF: I'm not too fluent in jquery
[09:24:33] <foo> nFFF: mostly just need a wide div that allows someone to scroll through. The scrolling should begin when someone starts swiping, and end when someone stops - like http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/scroll/ .
[09:24:39] <foo> Any points on starters?
[09:26:59] <nFFF> the jquery api :>
[09:27:19] <nFFF> do you know any jquery? becuase if not your obviously not going to be able to do it
[09:27:35] <nFFF> and you can either try and find another plugin that does what you want or pay someone to do it
[09:33:17] <jcalonso> Hi there!, So, I have this huge list of 1000 elements in JQM, and when I press the back button in the navigation bar, it takes some seconds before it go back. Can some one tell me whats going in the background and how to avoid this? Thank you!
[09:34:18] <BulleTime> hi guys anyone knows why my typewriter (chrome) is white within a content editable area? in internet explorer its black like normal
[09:34:45] <BulleTime> is there a setting for that?
[09:34:49] <BulleTime> (css)
[09:36:08] <Gho5t> what is a typewriter
[09:36:31] <[jmc]> I think he means the text cursor
[09:36:52] <[jmc]> I wouldn't even know how to change its color :P
[09:39:37] <grafi> probably by setting color: to something
[09:44:25] <foo> nFFF: I know some, but probably not enough to write this. You do freelance stuff? Would be curious on how much $ we're looking at

[10:30:13] <alvaro_o> How can I return a json from my server to let know a jQuery ajax call that there was an error in order to call the 'error' callback ?
[10:32:08] <rindolf> alvaro_o: what is your server written in?
[10:32:16] <rindolf> alvaro_o: s/server/service/?
[10:32:25] <alvaro_o> it's PHP
[10:33:37] <alvaro_o> le't say I have a php file called   service.php   which contains <?php echo json_encode('error' => 'There was an error'); ?>
[10:34:11] <alvaro_o> and what I want is that jQuery rises the callback 'error'
[10:34:45] <sCoRpi_> alvaro_o if you want jquery for fire the error-callback you will have to return a proper status-code
[10:35:21] <alvaro_o> sCoRpi_: like 404 ?
[10:35:36] <sCoRpi_> for example
[10:35:47] <sCoRpi_> depends on the actual error you want to communicate
[10:39:45] <veQue> http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18359 anyone reccomend using this for ie development?
[10:41:46] <alvaro_o> sCoRpi_: thanks! It did the trick :)

[10:49:22] <sCoRpi_> just ask?
[10:49:24] <sCoRpi_> oh
[10:49:25] <sCoRpi_> you did
[10:49:30] <sCoRpi_> sorry
[10:50:01] <foobar321> It's ok. Maybe my question is too easy, FAQ, RTFM or some other easy stuff?
[10:50:16] <foobar321> Or I've not given proper explenation of my problem ?
[10:50:37] <szonek> i have an <ul> with 6 images 200px in width each and overall ul width is 600px, so there are 2 rows of 3 images. when i change with jquery width of <ul> to 400px images are reorginized this way:
[10:50:41] <szonek> 1 2
[10:50:43] <szonek> 4 5
[10:50:44] <szonek> 6
[10:50:47] <szonek> 3.
[10:50:57] <szonek> and i would like to reorginize it this way:
[10:50:59] <szonek> 1 2
[10:50:59] <szonek> 3
[10:51:01] <szonek> sry
[10:51:04] <szonek> 1 2
[10:51:06] <szonek> 3 4
[10:51:08] <szonek> 5 6
[10:51:57] <szonek> any idea what has to be done? do i have to rewrite innerhtml of <ul> in jquery to "redraw" it?
[10:53:05] <sCoRpi_> szonek: if your default layout would be
[10:53:07] <sCoRpi_> 1 2 3
[10:53:08] <sCoRpi_> 4 5 6
[10:53:11] <sCoRpi_> everything should be fine
[10:53:46] <szonek> sCoRpi_: it is, but it moves only 3 and 6 which doesn't fit in 400px
[10:53:59] <sCoRpi_> uhm
[10:54:05] <szonek> since 1 2 and 3 4 are fine they don't move
[10:54:15] <sCoRpi_> that is wrong
[10:54:21] <sCoRpi_> they are 200px each
[10:54:29] <sCoRpi_> so in 600 3 fit in one row
[10:54:34] <szonek> yes
[10:54:37] <sCoRpi_> with 400px 2 fit in one row
[10:54:43] <sCoRpi_> resulting in the following flow
[10:54:45] <sCoRpi_> 1 2
[10:54:46] <sCoRpi_> 3 4
[10:54:47] <sCoRpi_> 5 6
[10:55:00] <sCoRpi_> each row with 400px width
[10:55:14] <szonek> yeah that's the idea but it doesn't work this way
[10:55:18] <sCoRpi_> if course if you applied margins to your items, you might need to recalculate those
[10:55:25] <sCoRpi_> or apply different classe
[10:55:26] <sCoRpi_> s
[10:55:53] <sCoRpi_> and yes: it does with that way
[10:56:11] <szonek> sCoRpi_: i know that, lets assume margin, padding and border = 0px
[10:57:04] <szonek> hmm, it looks like it's something wrong with my list, because when i set it manually to 400px from the begginig it's broken anyway
[10:57:10] <szonek> i'll check that
[10:57:56] <sCoRpi_> szonek: sec
[10:58:53] <DukeDrake> hi
[10:59:00] <sCoRpi_> szonek: http://jsfiddle.net/AQQRG/
[10:59:03] <sCoRpi_> click the list
[10:59:09] <DukeDrake> how can I use the last element with class 'xyz' ?
[10:59:19] <DukeDrake> $('.xyz') ....
[10:59:36] <sCoRpi_> $('.xyz').last()
[11:00:34] <DukeDrake> nice ^^
[11:00:59] <BLeg> gotta love those colutions
[11:01:04] <BLeg> solutions *
[11:01:24] <szonek> sCoRpi_: i see what's the problem, 3 last images are in div and that's what breaks it
[11:01:33] <sCoRpi_> there you go
[11:02:09] <szonek> sCoRpi_: thanks
[11:02:18] <sCoRpi_> welcome
[11:02:42] <szonek> sCoRpi_: but it shouldn't break it :P
[11:02:50] <sCoRpi_> uhm yes it should
[11:02:59] <szonek> hmm
[11:03:08] <szonek> span breaks it also
[11:03:12] <szonek> but in different way
[11:03:13] <szonek> ;p
[11:03:15] <sCoRpi_> lol
[11:03:28] <philsturgeon> trying to set a custom "Accepts" header and struggling. It needs to be application/vnd.com.kapture.api-v3+json
[11:03:45] <philsturgeon> trying to do this http://d.pr/i/y8xG but accepts is always */*
[11:03:56] <sCoRpi_> szonek: actually if you set a width on your li's
[11:04:02] <sCoRpi_> it won't break
[11:05:02] <szonek> i will try that
[11:06:10] <szonek> sCoRpi_: it works with span, div breaks it even if i set width on <li>'s
[11:06:18] <szonek> sCoRpi_: why it breaks it?
[11:06:40] <sCoRpi_> philsturgeon: maybe a stupid question, but did you try this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1145588/cannot-properly-set-the-accept-http-header-with-jquery
[11:06:48] <sCoRpi_> szonek: it doesn't
[11:07:12] <sCoRpi_> proof: http://jsfiddle.net/AQQRG/1/
[11:07:23] <szonek> ok w8
[11:11:42] <szonek> sCoRpi_: http://wieszjakjest.net/easy/
[11:12:03] <szonek> sCoRpi_: there'is "capabilities..." secrion
[11:12:13] <szonek> click on "read more"
[11:12:32] <szonek> sCoRpi_: 3 last images are in div, when i change it to span it works just fine
[11:12:52] <sCoRpi_> szonek: change your li's from "display:inline" to "float:left"
[11:14:53] <szonek> sCoRpi_: do i have to create <div> under the <ul> with clear both? because the list is now over the next section
[11:15:10] <sCoRpi_> apply "overflow:hidden" to your ul
[11:17:07] <szonek> sCoRpi_: it works.. sort of :P
[11:17:16] <sCoRpi_> fix your css :P
[11:17:21] <szonek> hehehe
[11:17:58] <szonek> anyway, big thanks sCoRpi_
[11:18:57] <szonek> sCoRpi_: http://wieszjakjest.net/easy/
[11:19:09] <szonek> checkout what's the behaviour now
[11:19:24] <sCoRpi_> i already know that - i tested it already ;)
[11:19:26] <szonek> :D
[11:19:40] <sCoRpi_> no idea why you change the width though
[11:20:00] <szonek> sCoRpi_: the plan is to put the description on the right
[11:21:34] <Otineb> anyone know how to get a form to submit when hitting enter if the submit button is type="button"?
[11:22:01] <Otineb> It also seems to call a required function
[11:22:15] <Otineb> <input type="button" value="Log in >>" id="loginButton" onClick="javascript:LogMeIn()">
[11:22:48] <Otineb> When I change the type to submit, the form fails. =/ (I should mention that it is sharing the page with a second form)
[11:24:38] <sCoRpi_> Otineb: if you don't want to use the normal submit-button, which would work with the enter key by default, you could attach a keypress-handler to yuor down and listen to keycode 13
[11:25:11] <sCoRpi_> but you'll have to make sure that if you have textareas where you can actually hit enter to jump to the next line you will catch those
[11:25:31] <Soufedj> hello
[11:25:35] <Soufedj> quelqu'un parle francais
[11:25:38] <Soufedj> ?
[11:26:01] <Otineb> @sCoRpi_ OOh.. I'm a JS noob. I saw some  examples online of the code == 13 handler but I couldn't get a working example to function on my specific form.
[11:26:13] <Otineb> the url is energytransfer.swpponline.com
[11:26:24] <Otineb> that registration form is the one in question.
[11:26:33] <sCoRpi_> post something on jsfiddle.net
[11:26:37] <Otineb> ok
[11:26:39] <Otineb> standby
[11:26:40] <sCoRpi_> a simplyfied example of your problem
[11:28:25] <philsturgeon> sCoRpi_: thanks you answered my question :)
[11:29:05] <Otineb> @sCoRpi_ http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/CYR5X/
[11:29:51] <Otineb> this includes the form in question. There is a second form (register) that has a formal type=submit button so I'm not sure if that will be a problem
[11:30:57] <Soufedj> var tePassword = document.getElementById("Password").value;
[11:31:03] <Soufedj> Otineb,
[11:31:40] <Soufedj> why you not use jquery
[11:32:06] <Otineb> @Soufedj I didn't write this form. It's part of an editable template for a hosted solution.
[11:33:34] <Otineb> @Soufedj: I'm a JS noob too so I am not sure what's superfluous vs what is needed. If the HTML/CSS this solution has is any indicator, I'm assuming the JS is whack too.
[11:34:30] <Otineb> @Soufedj: do you think ".value" is needed after the "var teUser = documentâ€¦" line?
[11:35:00] <Soufedj> Otineb, okok if u want i can script it for you
[11:35:20] <Soufedj> just explain me what you want in frensh plz
[11:36:06] <Otineb> @Soufedj: Wow really? Well, it's complicated. This login form is part of a larger solution. Can I PM you real quick and explain?
[11:36:11] <sCoRpi_> Otineb: http://jsfiddle.net/CYR5X/1/
[11:36:30] <Otineb> @sCoRpi_ Whoa!
[11:36:31] <sCoRpi_> now you just need to write your login function properly
[11:36:38] <Otineb> lol
[11:36:46] <Soufedj> Otineb, ok i scripting for you in jquery its to easy
[11:38:24] <Soufedj> sCoRpi_, and can you help me for so hard probleme ?
[11:38:43] <sCoRpi_> ?
[11:38:55] <Soufedj> i upload files 1 second
[11:40:06] <Otineb> @sCoRpi_ Ok, I pasted in the handler you wrote, I see your comment about calling logMeIn(). Do I just paste the original logMeIn function into that commented area? (I'm so sorry, total JS noob)
[11:41:46] <sCoRpi_> you call it
[11:42:00] <sCoRpi_> like LogMeIn();
[11:42:07] <Otineb> call it = .. oh!
[11:42:18] <Otineb> ok sweet lemme try it out
[11:44:46] <Browser> Do you usually use Jquery Mobile to develop website for mobiles or another framework?
[11:46:07] <scar> does anyone recommend a jquery calendar that accepts events via ajax?
[11:46:09] <jrockjiggz> I have 3 different files that need to use the same db record set.. how can 'save' the data object instead of generating the data each hit
[11:46:36] <Soufedj> sCoRpi_, i can send you with email my files ?
[11:46:57] <sCoRpi_> Soufedj: create an example on jsfiddle.net please
[11:47:16] <Otineb> @sCoRpi_ YOU ARE AWESOME. IT WORKS.
[11:47:21] <Soufedj> i cant know where is probleme becose i have to many js
[11:47:25] <sCoRpi_> jrockjiggz: you could store it in a var maybe?
[11:47:36] <sCoRpi_> Soufedj: then try to isolate the problem first
[11:49:07] <Soufedj> sCoRpi_, if i can isolate probleme i fix it
[11:49:16] <Soufedj> the probleme are for know where is it
[11:50:40] <sCoRpi_> Soufedj: remove all unneeded scripts, see if the error still turns up
[11:50:44] <sCoRpi_> what's the error actually?
[11:51:25] <Soufedj> i dont have error, when i use open map my script bug, and when i remove it its work i dont know why
[11:52:39] <Soufedj> http://pastebin.com/yUZvh0CL sCoRpi_
[11:53:18] <sCoRpi_> uhm yeah
[11:53:37] <sCoRpi_> how about checking your developer tools in your browser?
[11:53:44] <Soufedj> sCoRpi_, when i use Floating on Hover Menu script no detect when i not hover menu
[11:53:55] <Soufedj> i just use sCoRpi_ firebug
[11:54:15] <sCoRpi_> if something is broken you will see errors in the console
[11:54:49] <sCoRpi_> if something is just not working without errors, start adding console.log's to your application
[11:54:53] <sCoRpi_> or console.assert()
[11:54:59] <Soufedj> if i upload project can you see whith me if i have errors sCoRpi_
[11:55:37] <sCoRpi_> yeah i guess

[12:04:30] <veQue> *shrugs*
[12:04:30] <b-ot> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[12:04:34] <veQue> lol
[12:04:35] <sCoRpi_> magic \o/
[12:04:55] <veQue> yeh but now the problem is telling the client how to get it to work
[12:05:16] <veQue> it would be a lot easier telling them to  just download ff
[12:06:16] <sCoRpi_> veQue, what was the problem?
[12:06:38] <veQue> basically the client
[12:06:41] <veQue> =)
[12:06:49] <veQue> and the middleman
[12:07:55] <veQue> basicallly using jquery->phonegap->app... so why exactly does it need to run on ie i dunno
[12:08:28] <veQue> i read nothing about this having to work with browsers
[12:08:51] <veQue> i call myself being nice enough to send a firefox vers to get some checks
[12:08:57] <veQue> so i can change them
[12:09:09] <veQue> but they "don't have firefox" ?????
[12:09:32] <veQue> sooo i'm probably complaining a bit too much
[12:09:39] <veQue> so Cheeeese =D
[12:17:38] <hugo_moss> http://jsfiddle.net/eD7rt/2/ thats my problem, but apparently it works in jsfiddle, but in my code the alert after the done is executed before the done callback
[12:20:30] <shoky> hugo_moss you mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/eD7rt/3/
[12:21:16] <shoky> oops
[12:23:41] <hugo_moss> thats the same
[12:23:46] <hugo_moss> as my jsfiddle
[12:23:53] <hugo_moss> its weird i dont know
[12:24:03] <hugo_moss> i dont see any difference between my code and that jsfiddle
[12:24:06] <shoky> i meant like this: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/eD7rt/4/
[12:24:57] <systemfault> That's so sexy
[12:25:10] <shoky> no u
[12:25:14] <hugo_moss> yeah
[12:25:19] <hugo_moss> exactly like that
[12:25:24] <shoky> then it's fine
[12:25:26] <hugo_moss> except no
[12:25:28] <hugo_moss> wait
[12:25:37] <hugo_moss> no mine happens in this order:
[12:25:42] <hugo_moss> promise resolved.
[12:25:47] <hugo_moss> after when alert
[12:25:54] <hugo_moss> then $.when done executing
[12:25:57] <hugo_moss> alert
[12:26:18] <shoky> anyway.. it's expected that things you put after the .done()  are being executed before the callback
[12:26:29] <shoky> that's what the callback is there for, so it happens LATER
[12:26:30] <hugo_moss> 1.promise resolved alert. 2. after when alert. 3. when done executing
[12:27:02] <hugo_moss> ok
[12:27:15] <hugo_moss> is the debugging sequence im seeing not accurate?
[12:27:25] <shoky> alerting is not debugging
[12:27:25] <systemfault> shoky: btw, do you know if jquery takes advantage of the xhr2 progress event? I know that the Deferred object now contains ./notify and progress... not sure if the ajax function uses it.
[12:27:36] <shoky> ?alert
[12:28:15] <shoky> systemfault no idea, pretty sure i didn't see a mention of it at least until 1.8
[12:28:17] <hugo_moss> how can i debug it then? use webstorm?
[12:28:38] <shoky> hugo_moss: console.log  or use your browser's step-debugger
[12:28:47] <hugo_moss> right
[12:28:53] <hugo_moss> i was doing step debugging
[12:28:59] <hugo_moss> and witnessed the alerts
[12:29:04] <hugo_moss> is that different?
[12:29:05] <shoky> alerting is not debugging :)
[12:29:08] <hugo_moss> ok
[12:29:15] <hugo_moss> so its not accurate
[12:29:18] <hugo_moss> why is that?
[12:29:53] <shoky> i'm mostly being nitpicky, cause using a step debugger is fine (if you put breakpoints everywhere..)
[12:30:11] <shoky> but.. alerts halt the browser and the scripts
[12:30:23] <shoky> console.log doesn't
[12:36:41] <Ansikt> So, one of the people at my workplace wrote a jquery plugin, which does an action similar to this: "fooValue = $(this).attr('data-foo');$(this).attr('value') = fooValue;"  Which is fine and dandy, except that it doesn't do iteration so well.  How do I force iteration?  Is it better to wrap the entire function's innards in a .each(), or do I modify fooValue so that it's an array, or rename the method to $.fn.oneFoo and then have $.fn.
[12:37:05] <Ansikt> do I just call .each(function(){$(this).foo) whenever I want to perform that action on a collection?
[12:37:42] <Ansikt> *.each(function(){$(this).foo();});
[12:38:32] <shoky> .attr  can iterate too if you give it a function
[12:38:39] <foo> I am looking for this functionality: http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/scroll/ - but with horizontal scroll for mobile. I am trying to get some swipe-like code working, but that starts/stop swiping based on actual finger swipe. We tried swipe.js, but it swipes based on fixed width. Any tips?
[12:38:45] <shoky> Ansikt: but why not use .data() instead
[12:40:10] <Ansikt> *shrug* the original jquery we had in place when this was written was 1.2, which I think dates back to 2008 and predates .data .  No reason not to use .data, really, now that we're using a newer version (which is a whole issue in its self, really).
[12:40:26] <shoky> Ansikt:  and if .foo() is a properly written plugin/method then it will do the iteration inside
[12:41:02] <Ansikt> It doesn't.  It only sets that variable once, so it only performs the action on it once.
[12:41:13] <Wolf_22> I have a bunch of divs with the class of "dept" in each. Inside this divs is also an H3 with a link that I need to grab the URL of to append an HREF at the bottom of the div. To do this, I've used .each() to iterate through each div, grab the link and store it inside an array... This part works. However, when I need to append each link, I'm at a loss on how to properly do it. Suggestions?...
[12:41:14] <Wolf_22> ...I.e. - should I use ANOTHER .each() to append to the divs or is there a way I could do this with the existing each()? I'm confused...
[12:41:41] <shoky> Ansikt:  $(this).attr('value') = fooValue;   is wrong, anyways..
[12:42:53] <Ansikt> shoky, should I be using .val instead?  What's wrong with the way it's being done?
[12:43:25] <shoky> Ansikt:  if you wanna set the value then yes use .val
[12:43:39] <shoky> Ansikt:  and it's wrong because it doesnt work, first of all..
[12:43:52] <shoky> Ansikt: suppose you meant $(this).attr('value', fooValue)
[12:44:17] <shoky> but yeh use .val()  which also accepts a function
[12:44:17] <Ansikt> Oh, right.  We're using .val(), anyway.
[12:45:45] <shoky> return this.val(function() { return $(this).data('foo') });
[12:46:00] <Ansikt> Although, that isn't the part where I'm having an issue.  a data- field is holding the name of an id which must be added or removed dynamically.  The way it's set, it's only removing the first item's div and none of the others.
[12:46:20] <OnlyMax> someone can help me ? how i do this slidedown http://www.libradesign.com.br - click on portfolio and see the slidedown
[12:46:27] <Ansikt> Sorry I confused things with bad syntax.
[12:46:42] <shoky> anyway.. .each() is fine too
[12:47:08] <OnlyMax> ._.
[12:48:49] <shoky> Wolf_22: why store it inside an array?
[12:49:02] <foo> Any freelancers in here? PM me, may need a small task done.
[12:49:24] <Wolf_22> shoky: Sheer ignorance if you know of a better (easier) way. :)
[12:49:44] <shoky> Wolf_22:  just do it all inside the original .each
[12:50:05] <Wolf_22> shoky: I'll give it a try.
[12:50:15] <shoky> Wolf_22:  for each dept div,  grab the URL you need and append whatever you need. assuming you need to do those two things per each dept div
[12:50:21] <OnlyMax> someone can help me ._. ?
[12:51:16] <Wolf_22> shoky: That sounds right. I might've been using each on the wrong elements.
[12:52:25] <Ansikt> AH.  ,attr only returns the first value in the set.  Here's the actual code:var name = $this.attr('name').replace(/\/|\./g, "_"); then later: $('#err_' + name).remove();
[12:52:58] <shoky> .each is your friend
[12:57:53] <veQue> i have ie 9 on win 7. i'm trying to download ie 8... apparently it's not supported. i cant find ie in the uninstall programs
[12:57:58] <thinboy> Hey guys, what jquery plugin do you think is the best in implementing swipe functionality in image silder?
[12:59:18] <shoky> veQue: dont think you can ..
[13:00:08] <thinboy> What is the best swipe plugin for mobile image slider?
[13:00:19] <shoky> o maybe u can uninstall ie9 somehow dono
[13:01:04] <systemfault> Why would you even uninstall ie9?!
[13:01:37] <hlve> veQue, upgrading to Windows 8 updates your IE to IE10...
[13:01:49] <veQue> O_o
[13:01:52] <veQue> that makes no sense
[13:02:00] <hlve> Yes it does.
[13:02:02] <veQue> ie was on the laptop
[13:02:06] <veQue> ie 9 i mean
[13:02:16] <veQue> no...
[13:02:23] <hlve> Windows 8 supports IE10... not IE9.
[13:02:23] <veQue> how does that make sense?
[13:02:37] <veQue> ohhhhh
[13:02:38] <systemfault> Who even mentioning Windows 8?
[13:02:42] <systemfault> *mentioned
[13:02:43] <veQue> i see i misread that
[13:02:50] <hlve> oh wait
[13:02:52] <hlve> I misread that
[13:02:53] <shoky> yeah, please no mention of windows 8
[13:03:02] <hlve> I thought he said he was upgrading to Windows 8, not from IE 8
[13:03:03] <hlve> lol
[13:03:05] <veQue> i thought you said updating to ie 8 updates ie9  to ie10
[13:03:08] <hlve> sorry.
[13:03:12] <hlve> I'm retard.
[13:03:13] <hlve> :(
[13:03:37] <veQue> =) no problem. glad for the attempt
[13:03:58] <systemfault> Anyway :P My point still stands, not sure why would anyone sane revert from ie9 to ie8
[13:04:14] <veQue> systemfault: i'd rather just have both ies on my computer
[13:04:20] <hlve> You can't
[13:04:22] <veQue> client might be running ie 8
[13:04:31] <veQue> yeh that's why i'd uninstall 9
[13:04:36] <veQue> then i'd reinstall it later
[13:04:42] <jrockjiggz> lanes that cross eachother twice :) http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&tbo=d&biw=1366&bih=667&tbm=isch&tbnid=o3yY-y4bcANknM:&imgrefurl=http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/charlotteouterloop/&docid=hZ7tLJRW2x0m-M&imgurl=http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/charlotteouterloop/graphics/DivergingDiamond.jpg&w=400&h=223&ei=zXL0UMfPEcbNqQH4z4HYCQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=499&vpy=144&dur=185&hovh=167&hov

[13:04:43] <hlve> That's a horrible way to do compatibility testing
[13:04:44] <shoky> ;S
[13:04:44] <jrockjiggz> loops
[13:04:44] <hlve> lol
[13:05:03] <hlve> Run a Virtual Machine and put Windows XP on it... which natively only supports upto IE8
[13:05:20] <systemfault> veQue: Well.. just use the ie9 dev tools and use the ie8 emulation mode..
[13:05:22] <hlve> Or get sometihng like IE Tester...
[13:05:37] <veQue> systemfault:  thanks i'll try that
[13:05:51] <systemfault> veQue: That's what I do... then when it's nice in emulation mode, I open my windows xp + ie8 VM for a final check (optional)
[13:05:58] <hlve> veQue: http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage
[13:06:01] <hlve> That works wonders, too.
[13:06:11] <hlve> That way, you can test IE6, 7, and 8.
[13:06:25] <hlve> EVEN 5.5! (Not sure who in their right might would.)
[13:06:41] <systemfault> You have to be crazy to test for ie6 nowadays.
[13:06:44] * hlve gives shoky a nookie.
[13:07:18] <shoky> i'm not sure what that means but leave my underwear alone
[13:07:24] <systemfault> My brain just short-circuited. :/
[13:07:31] <hlve> :\
[13:07:57] <systemfault> Just had a mix of shoky + that old tune from limp bizkit :(
[13:08:03] <shoky> ._.
[13:08:05] <systemfault> "I did it all for the shoky! Come on! The shoky! So you can take that cookie" :/
[13:08:06] <hugo_moss> shoky: it looked like i was debugging wrong, i was using the step to next function call button
[13:08:12] <hugo_moss> and it was skipping some code
[13:08:45] <systemfault> hugo_moss: console.log is also a nice friend to have :)
[13:08:55] <hlve> systemfault, lol.
[13:08:58] <hlve> did you just.
[13:08:59] <systemfault> At least.. you don't have to press "OK" everytime you call it.
[13:09:12] <systemfault> (Like alert())
[13:10:08] <shoky> :~-]
[13:10:15] <Gho5t> what do you guys choose for variable name in a child function if $this is already in use by the parent's?
[13:11:36] <necro2607> $that?  :)
[13:11:48] <hugo_moss> but now what i dont get, i have a handler attached to a click event, and that function handler gets executed twice. first it runs, runs a promise function, resolves the promise, returns the promise, the done method is called, and then it reaches an animation.  the animation is a fadeout, and skips the callback as its not finished, and continues executing outside that scope.  but then after it
[13:11:48] <hugo_moss> continues executing the last statement, the same function gets called again, instead of entering where it left off.
[13:11:51] <hugo_moss> why?
[13:11:57] <Gho5t> yeah
[13:12:01] <Gho5t> was thinking that
[13:12:08] <Gho5t> no pun intended hahahahahahhahahahahahahahha
[13:12:56] <necro2607> heheh
[13:21:38] <thinboy> Any alternative plugin for swipe.js?
[13:22:20] <BillCriswell> thinboy: flexslider?
[13:22:42] <BillCriswell> http://flexslider.woothemes.com/ swipy swipey swipie
[13:23:53] <thinboy> BillCriswell does it allow the user to stop the slide where ever he wants? Or it is using a fixed width when being swipe. Just want to know.Thanks for ur answer.
[13:24:27] <Laure> Hello, iwould like to limite the size of my articles list. In fact I don't want to print all the content of my articles. Which technic have i to collapse long article or put ellipsis ?
[13:24:48] <Laure> (sorry for my english...)
[13:24:56] <BillCriswell> thinboy: I think it stops auto advancing once you click a control.
[13:25:30] <BillCriswell> thinboy: Yes, appears to be the case.
[13:26:27] <BillCriswell> thinboy: Yes. That's the case.
[13:26:33] <BillCriswell> I said that twice.
[13:30:33] <thethinboy> BillCriswell I am looking for a plugin that has the ability to stop after the user stops the swipe. For ex. he want only to see half of the image. do you know any plug in like that? Not auto advance.
[13:31:04] <hlve> BillCriswell is a hero.
[13:33:20] <BillCriswell> hlve: I wish.
[13:33:35] <hlve> well, I think you are.
[13:33:36] <hlve> :)
[13:33:44] <BillCriswell> Haha niiiice.
[13:33:50] <tlvb> does jquery support selectors based on .data(...) fields? I tried both $('[x="..."]') and $('[data-x="..."]') ...so I guess not?
[13:34:12] <BillCriswell> thethinboy: I mean... you could just use .animate() on a div with overflow scroll.
[13:38:39] <tlvb> nvm, I have found some docs on the subject
[13:38:54] <tw2113> liking what i see in the state of jquery post
[13:41:13] <esk_> hi everyone
[13:42:23] <thethinboy> BillCriswell Thank you! I'll try it.
[13:42:32] <hlve> See? Hero.
[13:45:12] <BillCriswell> thethinboy: https://squareup.com/careers has something you might be interested in... for ideas. Take a look at the "Square Headquaters" section.
[13:45:41] <BillCriswell> I don't like the idea of clicking and dragging to get it to scroll but on a touch device it's fun.
[13:46:29] <thethinboy> BillCriswell Sure, I'll take a look. Thanks Bill.
[13:46:36] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[13:47:36] <hlve> THE HERO STRIKES AGAIN
[13:48:31] <necro2607> *cue Drive theme music*
[13:57:40] <thethinboy>  I am looking for a jquery plugin that allows you to swipe from left to right (through images with varying width/height). The swiping gesture needs to start/stop from the time the person starts swiping and stops swiping. I have tried swipe.js, but it swipes at a fixed width, which is not what I'm looking for. Anyone have any tips? Something that is easy to implement.
[13:59:19] <hugo_moss> wow im fuckin retarded
[13:59:25] <hugo_moss> forgot a semicolon
[13:59:29] <hugo_moss> time wasted= 2hours
[14:01:06] <hlve> lol hugo_moss.
[14:01:07] <hlve> it happens.
[14:01:52] <necro2607> dude, use jslint
[14:02:11] <necro2607> i lint everything and it catches any sort of errors like that
[14:02:34] <necro2607> then again you kinda have to configure it to be less strict than default, otherwise you get an unmanageable number of errors/warnings
[14:02:37] <hlve> WELL GOOD FOR YOU :(
[14:02:45] <necro2607> rofl
[14:02:54] <necro2607> it's just good practice if you write a lot of JS
[14:03:08] <hlve> lol
[14:03:13] <necro2607> http://www.javascriptlint.com/docs/running_from_your_ide.htm
[14:04:15] <hugo_moss> do you need semicolons after function declarations?
[14:05:15] <necro2607> noes
[14:08:13] <hugo_moss> ok
[14:08:19] <hugo_moss> well you dont apparently
[14:08:24] <hugo_moss> and that helped me identify the problem
[14:08:34] <hugo_moss> i think
[14:10:05] <hugo_moss> how can i pass a function as an argument?
[14:10:10] <hugo_moss> without it being called
[14:12:01] <Suhana> don't add the braces -- myfunc, not myfunc() ?
[14:14:58] <hugo_moss> yeah
[14:15:04] <hugo_moss> thats what im doing
[14:15:07] <hugo_moss> i guess thats not the problem
[14:15:20] <hugo_moss> for some reason this event handler is being called twice
[14:15:38] <hugo_moss> im only attaching it once
[14:37:22] <mr_daniel> It's unbelievable how messy events in JavaScript still are. Just noticed that I am not able to bind 'mouseout' event on document.body with document.body.addEventListener('mouseout', function(){...}, false);
[14:42:36] <mr_daniel> solved it: need to bind on 'window' instead on 'body'
[14:53:54] <NickNack> anyone know of a good copy to clipboard plugin?
[14:54:29] <Suhana> https://github.com/jonrohan/ZeroClipboard
[14:54:49] <NickNack> this uses flash
[15:01:13] <mboro> when I transform an element to a certain value and the element already has that value, my transitionend event doesn't fire. is the only solution to look at the transform matrix and don't do the transform if they match?

[15:32:09] <VinSpee> hey guys, I'm having trouble passing the return value of a function. https://gist.github.com/4534540
[15:32:28] <VinSpee> basically, on success of the ajax function, it should return data.data._id
[15:33:25] <VinSpee> then when I do " this.set({ id: this.getNewID() }); ", I expect it to use that value. It instead sets it as an object. any help
[15:35:03] <ajpiano> VinSpee: ajax is asynchronous, the Session.prototype.getNewId method returns a promise, not the actual value
[15:35:20] <ajpiano> $.ajax doesn't return the value returned from the success function
[15:35:40] <VinSpee> it returns a promise to return the value?
[15:35:59] <ajpiano> yes, http://api.jquery.com/Promise/
[15:36:30] <VinSpee> so
[15:36:33] <ajpiano> it's essentially an interface around adding callbacks
[15:36:46] <VinSpee> so how do I have it return the value?
[15:37:13] <VinSpee> I'm somewhat familiar with promises, I just haven't harnessed them intentionaly yet :-)
[15:37:25] <VinSpee> will it return the value once it's complete
[15:37:26] <VinSpee> ?
[15:37:42] <ajpiano> this.getNewId().then( _.bind( function(data) { this.set({id: data.data._id});  }, this ));
[15:37:48] <ajpiano> VinSpee: you don't ever "return" it
[15:37:55] <ajpiano> instead it sort of gets passed along from step to step
[15:38:06] <VinSpee> ahh
[15:39:39] <ajpiano> though no matter what you do, you won't be able to rely on a new Session instance having an ID property when .initialize() returns
[15:40:26] <ajpiano> but that's ok, cause your onIdChange handler will fire when the this.set happens :)
[15:42:07] <VinSpee> @ajpiano I'm expecting it no NOT have an ID, correct?
[15:42:38] <ajpiano> correct
[15:42:51] <therealklanni> aj want to help me with ajax prefilters? :P
[15:43:04] <ajpiano> haha, not too deeply at the moment
[15:43:17] <ajpiano> therealklanni: my gut instinct based only on your prob description is like, use a wrapping deferreed
[15:43:25] <therealklanni> I am doing that
[15:43:33] <ajpiano> darn
[15:43:52] <therealklanni> I can't get it to fire the callbacks AND abort the ajax
[15:44:22] <therealklanni> Aborting the ajax causes the jqxhr object to change to an "error" ("cancelled") status
[15:44:47] <therealklanni> So I can get the deferred to work, but not if I try to abort the ajax
[15:45:13] <therealklanni> Anyway
[15:47:18] <ajpiano> hmm
[15:47:25] <ajpiano> i would kinda say you might want to write it down for the ofurm
[15:47:26] <ajpiano> forum
[15:48:01] <therealklanni> worth a shot
[15:49:22] <martisj> i've got a $.ajax request and it's somehow being called twice, once where it returns proper data, and the next time it returns an error.
[15:49:27] <martisj> ANy ideas how to debug this/
[15:49:45] <therealklanni> haha the captcha image is not working to sign up on the forum
[15:50:21] <martisj> nvm
[15:50:22] <therealklanni> just my luck
[15:50:25] <martisj> figured it out
[15:50:46] <martisj> a script is being loaded that makes a call to the same function againa :S
[15:50:49] <martisj> god damn it
[15:57:29] <therealklanni> Hmm, I may have figured out a resolution
[15:58:30] <therealklanni> Basically, I just need a jqXHR object I can modify with my cached response
[16:04:31] <VinSpee> thanks ajpiano, that was exactly the ticket.
[16:05:01] <ajpiano> therealklanni: oh i guess sort of what i meant
[16:05:13] <ajpiano> was to kind of do a wrapping deferred instead of a prefilter
[16:05:15] <ajpiano> now that i think of it
[16:05:25] <ajpiano> so that instead of trying to muck around with the jqxhr itself
[16:05:45] <therealklanni> ajpiano: Well, I'm using deferred of course, but it has to be done in the prefilter because what I'm doing is caching the entire response
[16:06:03] <ajpiano> you have like, a service with the cache inside of it, and it always returns a new deferred if it's cached and only does ajax if it actually needs to go to the server
[16:06:37] <therealklanni> right
[16:06:40] <ajpiano> that could happen *before* the prefilter
[16:06:57] <ajpiano> instead of having to cancel ajax if there's a cache hit, you just never initiate a request
[16:07:02] <therealklanni> Well I'm trying to make it seamless in the ajax
[16:07:17] <therealklanni> So we don't have to go and rewrite every ajax call witha  function wrapper
[16:07:29] <ajpiano> ah, well then you're in trouble
[16:07:29] <therealklanni> If that's what you mean
[16:07:42] <ajpiano> this is why i always use service wrappers and never have things call $.ajax directly
[16:07:48] <ajpiano> :p
[16:07:52] <therealklanni> haha
[16:08:12] <therealklanni> Yeah, I just don't want to rewrite code, but I *could*
[16:08:14] <ajpiano> cause i always want an app-level layer of granularity instead of having to solve it "inside" of jQuery
[16:08:23] <ajpiano> depends how much $.ajax code you have already written
[16:08:34] <therealklanni> I mean technically the ajax calls are already abstracted from the rest of the framework anyway
[16:08:45] <therealklanni> A few dozen
[16:09:21] <therealklanni> It wouldn't be that big of a deal, maybe a half-day to a day's work
[16:09:49] <ajpiano> i find it's always worth it
[16:10:00] <ajpiano> cause you can like, unify any shared options you have
[16:10:00] <ajpiano> etc
[16:10:25] <therealklanni> Well the only thing shared is handled in $.ajaxSetup anyway
[16:10:49] <ajpiano> yeah i've tended to eschew that stuff since like, always
[16:10:53] <therealklanni> But yeah, I may just give up and use a function wrapper
[16:11:09] <therealklanni> What, using $ajaxSetup?
[16:11:13] <therealklanni> et al
[16:11:14] <ajpiano> yeah
[16:11:29] <therealklanni> Interesting
[16:11:53] <ajpiano> it's like, i'd rather build my house and give jquery a room in it
[16:11:57] <ajpiano> than move into jquery's apartment
[16:12:23] <therealklanni> lol
[16:12:28] <therealklanni> true
[16:12:34] <EyePulp> ajpiano: that's a really decent analogy
[16:12:35] <coldhead> if jQuery would have me, i'm there
[16:12:41] <coldhead> to hell with building houses
[16:12:45] <EyePulp> jquery completes you?
[16:12:46] <coldhead> that's for suckers
[16:12:49] <ajpiano> EyePulp: :)
[16:13:02] <ajpiano> i find that most things about jQuery can be described using either house metaphors or unicorn metaphors
[16:13:10] <EyePulp> heh
[16:14:06] <ajpiano> and then of course there's that old chestnut about the homeless unicorn
[16:14:51] <oliwe> what are you suppose to use instead of ".next" in thi script: http://jsfiddle.net/Ze7uB/5/
[16:14:56] <oliwe> i tried using .find without luck
[16:15:35] <ajpiano> ?next @ oliwe
[16:15:35] <bot-t> oliwe, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[16:15:36] <ajpiano> whoops
[16:15:39] <ajpiano> ?next2 @ oliwe
[16:15:40] <bot-t> oliwe, .next("selector") is not "magically find the next element anywhere in the DOM that matches the selector". .next() looks at an element's next immediate sibling and then filters it by the selector. You might want to try .nextAll("selector").first(). (Note: .prev and .prevAll work the same way)
[16:16:05] <oliwe> aah
[16:16:06] <oliwe> thanks
[16:16:12] <oliwe> i knew the first bit though
[16:18:54] <ajpiano> i don't doubt it :)
[16:25:39] <martisj> I've got a nav bar that follows down the site when scrolling, and when you click a link in the bar it jumps to a section of the site (based on ids) however the bar is covering part of the heading, is there a way to prevent this from happening i.e. having the id for the link higher or something of the sort?
[16:25:53] <martisj> see basketskolen.martinsjastad.com
[17:23:08] <abjorn> ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
[17:24:10] <snover> i agree abjorn
[17:58:03] <oojacoboo> jq modal plugin?  which one?
[18:00:16] <phonebook_> oojacoboo, http://jqueryui.com/dialog/ ?
[18:00:29] <oojacoboo> yea, saw that, was asking for a friend, that's what I told him
[18:00:35] <oojacoboo> I've always made my own :P
[18:02:04] <phonebook_> some nice example here. the second one is pretty cool
[18:02:08] <phonebook_> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/what-is-the-best-jquery-based-window-plug-in-you-have-ever-used
[18:02:21] <phonebook_> ive spent a few weeks with it
[18:02:48] <phonebook_> worked as advertised
[18:23:56] <martisj> what is the best way to do document_ready for jquery?
[18:25:22] <abjorn> ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°) well, you could put your javascript at the bottom of the page instead
[18:26:17] <phonebook_> document.ready is implicit with $(document).ready(function() { /* myCode */ });
[18:26:48] <phonebook_> or just document.onload = function() {}
[18:27:52] <hugo_moss> when is document.ready called? only once?
[18:29:13] <phonebook_> you can put in anywhere. 100 times if you want. it will always work. it's $(document).ready(function(){}); .i believe it is called when the browser has read through the entire page and has no other init work to do
[18:29:14] <systemfault> Yeah, when the browser is done parsing the dom tree
[18:29:37] <systemfault> Things like images are not yet loaded.
[18:30:06] <systemfault> domready would be useless if everyone would put their scripts at the end of the html file
[18:30:41] <phonebook_> youd have to be a lunatic to use it
[18:32:08] <hugo_moss> whats the consequence of creating a function expression but without a var at the beginning like:
[18:32:20] <hugo_moss> funcName= function(){};
[18:32:32] <hugo_moss> instead of var funcName= function(){};
[18:34:05] <systemfault> hugo_moss: It creates a global.. and becomes invalid in es5 strict mode
[18:34:07] <phonebook_> pollutes global namespace / possible memory leak / not clean
[18:34:49] <hugo_moss> mmhmm ok
[18:34:53] <hugo_moss> thanks
[18:42:04] <Aqeel> do get a habbit of using var
[18:42:53] <coldhead> habit*
[18:43:39] <systemfault> hobbit
[18:47:10] <hugo_moss> anyone care to help me debug something
[18:47:31] <martisj> hugo_moss: what is it?
[18:48:24] <hugo_moss> i call .on to attach a handler to a click event, when i click it, it calls that handler repeatedly
[18:48:28] <hugo_moss> i have no idea why
[18:48:37] <hugo_moss> could it be because the .on is in the document.ready?
[18:48:51] <hugo_moss> should i be using .one?
[18:49:27] <phonebook_> i didnt know there was a .one
[18:50:07] <hugo_moss> yea not alot of people use it, but its there
[18:50:24] <phonebook_> what is the event?
[18:50:40] <hugo_moss> click touchstart
[18:51:43] <phonebook_> unless you have many document.ready it will only attach once
[18:56:08] <hugo_moss> hmm
[18:56:15] <hugo_moss> i have two document.ready in separate files
[18:56:21] <hugo_moss> doing different things
[19:07:26] <zubelgenubi> NodeX, you around?
[19:28:27] <erdos> heeeeeey
[19:29:04] <erdos> the new jquery api site is sexy
[19:29:40] <hugo_moss> yea
[19:29:46] <hugo_moss> you noticed that too huh
[19:30:03] <erdos> well, i didn't not notice it
[19:30:36] <hugo_moss> so you noticed it :)
[19:30:45] <erdos> hehe
[19:35:57] <systemfault> I don't like the new "blue" :P
[19:37:56] <hugo_moss> write less, do more.
[19:38:02] <hugo_moss> jquery.
[19:58:35] <txt231> Hey guys. Does anyone know a good lightweight tool-tip that supports HTML elements inside of it?
[19:58:46] <rfish> qtip2
[20:00:27] <txt231> That's what we are using but just wanted to see if there are any alternatives :)
[20:03:00] <Cork> txt231: beautytip
[20:23:17] <therealklanni> Seems like the new operator is optional when invoking $.Deferred, is that right?
[20:25:42] <scar> can anyone tell me why this test won't work, in my page.php ? http://pastebin.com/LhCruf7F
[20:25:50] <wroathe> Would you guys consider the use of $.proxy to be a good or a bad thing?
[20:25:50] <scar> the nonce validation will not work...
[20:26:04] <scar> even if i remove the $_POST method.. and just check wp_verify_nonce....
[20:26:05] <scar> l
[20:26:17] <systemfault> wroathe: Good when needed.
[20:26:21] <wroathe> For instance: $('.btn').on('click', $.proxy(callback, this));
[20:26:58] <wroathe> Basically right now I'm at a point where I'm binding two different handlers and I need some shared data between them
[20:27:06] <wroathe> I could either force the context that has the data I need
[20:27:21] <wroathe> Or I could pass it in as the data argument to $.fn.on
[20:28:44] <wroathe> So it's between: $('.btn').on('click', $.proxy(callback, this)); and $('.btn').on('click', { options: this.options }, callback);
[20:30:25] <therealklanni> wroathe: there are benefits to both methods
[20:30:45] <wroathe> therealklanni: such as?
[20:31:11] <wroathe> element context isn't a real concern because I typically do something like var $this = $(e.target) inside of my handler
[20:31:13] <therealklanni> wroathe: for instance, with proxy you are overriding the context of the callback, with the other method you leave the context as is yet you are passing your data still, so kind of best of both
[20:31:42] <wroathe> therealklanni: Yeah, but in the former case you can get that same context by doing what I did above with $this
[20:31:57] <wroathe> so either way you've got the necessary parts
[20:31:58] <scar> woops wrong chanle!
[20:31:59] <therealklanni> Exactly, so like I said, pros and cons for both
[20:32:11] <wroathe> Well, I'd be interested in hearing some cons
[20:32:13] <therealklanni> Just depends on what you need or what you're doing with it
[20:32:38] <therealklanni> Well the pros for either are cons if what you want is the other lol
[20:33:09] <erdos> hey, is there any preferred attribute (in html) to attach arbitrary data to? like alt or rel or something like that?
[20:33:17] <wroathe> erdos: use $.data
[20:33:25] <therealklanni> ?data @erdos
[20:33:25] <bot-t> erdos, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[20:33:32] <erdos> oh yeah i got that
[20:33:39] <erdos> but i need to derive meaning from a page
[20:33:49] <wroathe> erdos: Post code
[20:33:49] <erdos> the data has to come through in the html
[20:33:51] <therealklanni> Then use data attributes
[20:34:03] <wroathe> what therealklanni said
[20:34:06] <wroathe> do taht
[20:34:16] <therealklanni> ?g mdn data attribute @erdos
[20:34:18] <bot-t> erdos, element.dataset - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.dataset
[20:34:20] <erdos> oh i didn't realise there was one!
[20:34:24] <erdos> thank you i'll check that out!
[20:34:32] <therealklanni> That might be the wrong link
[20:34:36] <therealklanni> Just google it :)
[20:35:29] <therealklanni> Bonus: jQuery will automatically scrape data attributes from HTML with its $.data method
[20:35:40] <erdos> orly? that's handy
[20:36:42] <erdos> hmmmm, no dtd in html5, will this work on older browsers?
[20:36:53] <therealklanni> So using <div id="luggage" data-combination="12345">, you can do $('#luggage').data('combination') to get the value
[20:37:08] <erdos> oh sweeeeet!
[20:37:10] <erdos> this is great!
[20:37:14] <therealklanni> Indeed
[20:38:08] <nocturne7> what's the best way to pull in a JS library such as google.maps synchronously ?
[20:38:16] <snover> you canâ€™t
[20:38:18] <snover> so donâ€™t try
[20:38:19] <therealklanni> Why syncronously
[20:38:28] <therealklanni> +h
[20:38:47] <erdos> also, just quickly, does .each guarantee to execute in the order dom elements are ordered?
[20:39:11] <nocturne7> well, I want to make the dependency obvious in the js file as opposed to loading it in the JSP with <script> tags
[20:39:43] <nocturne7> snover, yes, I tried a lot of ways of doing that today, did not work
[20:40:17] <therealklanni> nocturne7: try AMD?
[20:41:09] <nocturne7> therealklanni, I wish I could. the idiots on my team giving me a hard time simply because I am using namespaces
[20:41:27] <nocturne7> if I were using AMD, they would go nuts totally I think :)
[20:41:28] <therealklanni> Nothing wrong with namespaces
[20:41:36] <snover> there is if you are an idiot
[20:41:41] <snover> GLOBAL FUNCTIONS EVERYWHERE
[20:41:42] <therealklanni> lol
[20:41:47] <therealklanni> Fair enough
[20:42:02] <nocturne7> therealklanni, I know, but these guys are idiots
[20:42:15] <nocturne7> :)
[20:42:16] <therealklanni> Indeed, sir.
[20:42:52] <nocturne7> and they do not want to learn how to use namespace because it requires "training", give me a break
[20:46:29] <raj> in .css(), is 'width':'auto' the same as 'width':''?
[20:47:21] <danheberden> no
[20:47:35] <danheberden> 'width':'' would just set '' to the style attr on the element
[20:47:41] <danheberden> and any width set via stylesheet would still get applied
[20:47:52] <da-beginner> hi.. what is the correct syntax for this? filterState.live('change', function() {     console.log(this); 	selectedState = $(this + " option:selected").val(); 	console.log(selectedState); });
[20:47:56] <erdos> nah don't think so
[20:47:58] <danheberden> if you want an actual 'auto' width, or rather, to remove some set width in a style sheet
[20:48:09] <danheberden> then yeah, you gotta set 'auto'
[20:48:13] <danheberden> raj ^
[20:48:33] <erdos> oh actually maybe, i think it would go to whatever is default
[20:48:46] <erdos> and yeah just checked "auto" appears to be the default
[20:48:51] <danheberden> da-beginner: $(this).find( 'option:selected') i think is what you're after
[20:49:12] <danheberden> right now you're doing $( '[Object object] option:selected' )
[20:49:28] <wroathe> I've got some DOM traversal and other things I'd like to remove/optimize about this code: https://gist.github.com/c186085fa5cda38a8ac7 Any advice on how I could make this more concise would be awesome.
[20:49:32] <danheberden> because `this` is an object
[20:50:41] <wroathe> Basically if either form element is changed I perform a lookup on a hash of values that match the select's value
[20:50:48] <wroathe> and then multiply the returned number by the number of physicians
[21:01:48] <deanclkclk> is there a way to undo a preventdefault?
[21:02:10] <systemfault> Don't do it :)
[21:02:10] <coldhead> refactor your code so you only preventDefault when you really want to
[21:02:36] <coldhead> you can't unfry something, jerri. you can't be something you're not.
[21:04:17] <deanclkclk> I'm doing a mobile app
[21:04:32] <deanclkclk> when someone remove touchend...then on a dom...I remove the preventDefault
[21:04:35] <deanclkclk> something like that
[21:04:38] <deanclkclk> it can't be done?
[21:05:27] <coldhead> you can try triggering the event again when you need it
[21:05:32] <coldhead> maybe that will work
[21:05:57] <coldhead> but it's bad and you should feel bad
[21:06:00] <deanclkclk> trigger what event?
[21:06:21] <deanclkclk> there's no way around it man
[21:06:26] <deanclkclk> I've been on this for hours
[21:06:37] <deanclkclk> and to tell u the truth...right about now..i need some sleep
[21:07:16] <coldhead> i pray a more elegant solution comes to you in a dream
[21:07:25] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[21:07:34] <erdos> lol
[21:07:50] <deanclkclk> fawk this shit
[21:07:59] <deanclkclk> have deadline tomorrow man
[21:08:15] <deanclkclk> a lot insomnia right now
[21:08:23] <deanclkclk> like i'm on menopause
[21:09:50] <coldhead> can you really not just add some extra code around the preventDefault that only does it in when you want?
[21:10:45] <coldhead> if ( $(this).is(':not(.touchable)') ) e.preventDefault(); // ?
[21:26:21] <raj> thanks danheberden
[21:26:43] <raj> .resizable() in jqui is setting a z-index of 1000 on the handle
[21:26:58] <raj> it's doing so in the js, not using the css
[21:27:06] <raj> how can I fix this?
[21:27:49] <danheberden> raj: what is "fixing? this - do you need a different z-index?
[21:27:54] <danheberden> you could just set it yourself on the open event
[21:27:58] <danheberden> or resize event rather
[21:28:21] <raj> well, it would be open
[21:28:25] <raj> cuz it's overlapping a menu
[21:28:52] <raj> i see it's been found as a bug
[21:28:52] <raj> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/changing-zindex-for-resizables-handles
[21:28:58] <raj> wonder if it's been fixed
[21:29:16] <raj> or, I guess it obv hasn't
[21:35:15] <defaultro> good evening folks. How do I check if a class exists?
[21:35:24] <defaultro> hasClass?
[21:36:18] <mindis|wurk> that checks if an element has a class (duh)
[21:36:40] <defaultro> yup, I want to check if an element has a class
[21:36:58] <defaultro> somewhere in our program, we use addClass(checkmarkicon)
[21:37:09] <defaultro> i would like to check if checkmarkicon is still present
[21:37:58] <mindis|wurk> you can also use selectors/filters to check for it
[21:38:09] <defaultro> k
[21:38:25] <defaultro> ah, I didn't know hasClass is a jquery function :)
[21:38:30] <defaultro> that's enough for me :)
[21:38:37] <coldhead> ?is
[21:38:37] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[21:39:04] <defaultro> .is("checkmarkicon"), like this?
[21:39:31] <systemfault> Would work if there would be a checkmarkicon html tag...
[21:39:45] <coldhead> .is(".checkmarkicon")
[21:39:48] <coldhead> has to be a selector
[21:39:52] <defaultro> it's a class="checkmarkicon"
[21:39:57] <defaultro> ah
[21:40:01] <defaultro> awesome
[21:40:41] <defaultro> the code would be $("li#pio a").is('.checkmarkicon');
[21:41:40] <defaultro> i wrote that because there is a code like this, $("li#pio a").addClass("checkmarkicon');
[21:43:10] <defaultro> oh wait, will this be correct since I need it in my if statement
[21:43:24] <defaultro> if ($("li#pio a").is('.checkmarkicon')) {
[21:45:25] <defaultro> I got it working
[21:54:32] <coldhead> protip: class="float:left" doesn't work
[21:58:11] <Lann> aarrrrgh. I have a link inside of a colorbox's iframe. The link has an onclick event in the source and it also has an href. Even if i preventDefault on the link it's still moving the URL of the iframeâ€¦why?
[21:58:41] <Lann> even if i unbind click to ensure no other libs are adding click events
[22:01:23] <coldhead> how are you preventDefaulting?
[22:04:09] <mindis|wurk> Lann have you checked you even intercept the event in the parent document?
[22:04:29] <Lann> yeah, it does a console.log
[22:05:29] <mindis|wurk> so you have now something like thelink.click( function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }); ?
[22:06:20] <mindis|wurk> one option is that you have defined the event before the iframe content has loaded
[22:06:34] <Lann> i checked that and changed it to window.load
[22:06:55] <Lann> just to be sure, i chang ethe link color to red to ensure it fired
[22:07:07] <Lann> it's redâ€¦still moves the page
[22:07:21] <mindis|wurk> i prefer alert since it actually stops everything else but hmm
[22:08:20] <Cork> Lann: i think the best next action you can do is try to reproduce it in a minimalistic test case
[22:08:30] <Cork> (preferably in jsfiddle)
[22:08:54] <Cork> so that you know what code is working and keeping down the unknown
[22:10:49] <Lann> hmmmmâ€¦i may have found the strangeness. it was doing a window.open on this.href
[22:11:00] <Cork> heh
[22:11:02] <Lann> and with drupal involved who knows what this.href does
[22:11:23] <Cork> this.href is the href on the link most likely
[22:11:33] <Cork> so it ran javascript when the link was clicked
[22:25:20] <Jimu> Having trouble with $().off('click'..), here's my jsfiddle example: http://jsfiddle.net/j98vS/
[22:26:01] <Jimu> I remember running into this problem before with removing event listeners, but can't seem to figure out how i last fixed it
[22:36:47] <coldhead> it sure beats the heck out of me
[22:40:12] <Jimu> found it... stupid mistake
[22:42:33] <coldhead> enlighten ,e!
[22:42:34] <coldhead> me*
[22:42:50] <coldhead> i want to learn your strange prototype ways
[22:55:47] <jayd3e> so in order to scroll to the top of an element I'm doing this $('html, body').animate({'scrollTop': elem.offset().top}, 5000);  Problem is, it scrolls below the element, right below it
[22:55:53] <jayd3e> how would I debug this?
[23:01:14] <spills> "_?!
[23:01:56] <coldhead> ?fweep
[23:01:56] <bot-t> coldhead, FLIFF FLIFF
[23:14:51] <Cork> jayd3e: check what offset().top gives for that element, and verify that it is what it should be
[23:16:31] <jayd3e> Cork: I'm at a place in the page that is extremely far down
[23:16:39] <jayd3e> it would be very hard to verify it
[23:16:55] <Cork> jayd3e: not really
[23:17:07] <Cork> console.log(element.offset().top)
[23:18:18] <jayd3e> right but how do I verify that it's the "right" number
[23:18:58] <Cork> scroll the page to where that should be
[23:19:03] <jayd3e> b/c scrollTop is taking me to the wrong place(below elem), and is using element.offset().top.  So that means that element.offset().top must be yielding the wrong value
[23:19:07] <Cork> and run console.log(window.scrollTop)
[23:19:14] <Cork> then check how much it differ
[23:19:15] <jayd3e> kk yah good idea
[23:19:25] <jayd3e> so let's say it differs by 120
[23:19:26] <Cork> and look for where that would come from
[23:19:42] <jayd3e> gotcha.  Is it likely a float issue or something?
[23:19:56] <Cork> don't think so
[23:20:02] <Cork> not sure what it would be
[23:20:10] <Cork> if you can't find it you would have to generate a testcase
[23:34:54] <sCoRpi_> good morning
[23:37:28] <Nebros_> moin
[23:39:44] <Qbix1> hey guys
[23:39:54] <Qbix1> very weird bug, I submit a form and somewhere in the jquery code I get this: TypeError: Cannot call method 'toLowerCase' of undefined
[23:39:57] <Qbix1> why?
[23:40:12] <Qbix1> this happens after the submit handler function already runs, and calls event.preventDefault()
[23:40:18] <Qbix1> any advice about what could cause such errors?
[23:41:06] <Qbix1> hi woozly
[23:41:07] <Qbix1> any advice?
[23:41:27] <woozly> hi) about?
[23:42:21] <sCoRpi_> Qbix1: you are trying to call toLowerCase() on a variable i guess
[23:42:24] <sCoRpi_> and that one is undefined
[23:42:33] <sCoRpi_> hence the value you are trying to assign to it, isn't defined
[23:42:41] <sCoRpi_> has nothing to do with jquery
[23:42:48] <Aqeel> hi all
[23:42:55] <sCoRpi_> hi
[23:43:19] <Aqeel> can someone confirm ... having this issue or not...
[23:43:25] <sCoRpi_> Qbix1: start debugging your code after the call to preventDefault(), check your assignments
[23:44:01] <Aqeel> goto jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html hover over menu and submenu... does the text changes size..
[23:44:23] <Aqeel> i having this behaviour in my firefox.. i am unable to trace it logically
[23:44:48] <Qbix1> I try to debug it but it's internal jquery code
[23:44:52] <Qbix1> I will try to get the non-min version
[23:44:55] <Aqeel> tried everything.. please confirm if you people also see this behaviour
[23:44:55] <sCoRpi_> i only  get "USE OTHER BROWSERS
[23:44:56] <sCoRpi_> SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION
[23:45:07] <Aqeel> use firefox or ie..
[23:45:20] <sCoRpi_> uhm no
[23:45:30] <sCoRpi_> make it compatible with chrome :P
[23:45:47] <Aqeel> working on that..
[23:45:50] <sCoRpi_> why would you even prevent a next-gen browser?
[23:45:57] <Aqeel> not prevent
[23:46:12] <Aqeel> chrome and opera.. act differently
[23:46:12] <sCoRpi_> ?
[23:46:16] <sCoRpi_> hehe
[23:46:23] <Aqeel> yup
[23:47:07] <Aqeel> so anyone got the issue or only me?
[23:47:43] <sCoRpi_> Aqeel: i cannot even hover on the submenu
[23:47:45] <Nebros_> i tried to send a form with doubleclick on a value in select list. i can select, but it will not send with doubleclick... i dont know why. my knowlege in jquery is based on copy/paste. ^^ http://jsfiddle.net/2CPLP/4/ can someone help me? :)
[23:48:07] <sCoRpi_> i can hover on the menu, when i try  to move to the submenu (which has entries but no text) it disappears again
[23:48:17] <sCoRpi_> in firefox aswell
[23:48:29] <sCoRpi_> ah i have to click it?
[23:49:33] <sCoRpi_> Aqeel: for me the textsize doesn't change
[23:51:57] <seba4> Hi guys ... one question can u define more one action on more ids... like $('#name', '#name2').click ....  or $('#name').('#name2').click
[23:52:19] <seba4> can u define more than one id on one action *
[23:53:27] <sCoRpi_> Nebros_: first of all, don't comment your code in german :P
[23:53:54] <sCoRpi_> Nebros_: your exampel doesn't even work in jsfiddle
[23:55:44] <sCoRpi_> Nebros_: http://jsfiddle.net/2CPLP/5/
[23:55:48] <sCoRpi_> you didn'T reference your form correctly
[23:56:34] <sCoRpi_> seba4: it's the former, but i'd strongly suggest your read the jquery docs
[23:57:19] <Nebros_> its in german, cause another one helped me here 14h ago. :D
[23:57:28] <seba4> ok
[23:58:20] <ajpiano> seba4: it's $("#name1, #name2")
[23:58:30] <ajpiano> api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[23:59:58] <sCoRpi_> haha Nebros_ ;)
