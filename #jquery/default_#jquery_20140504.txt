[00:00:27] <systemfault> hi
[00:00:54] <idontevenknow> http://pastie.org/private/4psiv3yvu9g0gan8sr7mw
[00:01:06] <idontevenknow> I am trying to get the href attribute of a particular element that I hover over
[00:01:14] <idontevenknow> but it just returns an empty object when I run it
[00:01:32] <idontevenknow> however $("a['href'][onclick^='highlightReply']").href[indexnumber]
[00:01:35] <systemfault> idontevenknow: You’re mixing DOM and jQuery, you want either this.href or $(this).attr(‘href’)
[00:01:42] <idontevenknow> ok
[00:01:43] <zylophone> so any html string that's being parsed has to needlessly be wrapped in some sort of containing element?
[00:02:13] <systemfault> zylophone: Depending on your needs, yes.
[00:02:42] <zylophone> heh, thanks
[00:03:46] <systemfault> $(‘.foo’, context) means, look for all .foo that are inside the currently selected nodes(top level)
[00:37:50] <Parsi> i'm trying to add a new item to chosen enabled select
[00:38:18] <Parsi> but it's not working as expected
[00:38:22] <Parsi> https://github.com/koenpunt/chosen/issues/43
[00:38:28] <Parsi> anyone familiar with it?
[00:41:11] <TheJHNZ> how hard would it be to detect a url in a string and put it in an anchor ?
[00:41:17] <TheJHNZ> regex right ?
[00:45:16] <Parsi> yes TheJHNZ
[00:45:29] <Parsi> finding http, https until a space
[00:47:26] <TheJHNZ> would i explode by space
[00:47:33] <TheJHNZ> then check every word?
[00:48:38] <systemfault> You could probably do it entirely with a regex.
[00:48:42] <systemfault> Too bad I suck at them
[00:49:15] <sflw> Quick question before I ask my question, what's the preferred format for linking code in this channel? First-timer here.
[00:49:28] * sflw facepalm.
[00:49:31] <sflw> Nevermind. I just read the topic.
[00:49:49] <Jattenalle> sflw, :)
[00:50:05] <sflw> Let me get my code up on jsfiddle and then I'll come back with a slightly more intelligent question.
[01:02:07] <sflw> Okay, so here's what I'm working with: http://jsfiddle.net/qTe2k/. The issue I'm having is getting the .options div to toggle() on mouseenter/mouseleave of the .shopping-list div. Also, when an item is added to the list the class .need is attached. I was originally trying to target that but it wasn't working.
[01:02:34] <sflw> The positioning and some things are still messed up in this code, but if I can get the toggle of .options working properly then that's what I'm looking for.
[01:04:53] <ryez> is it safe to modify an array during traversing via array.some() ?
[01:52:46] <nimblecoin> hi, i seem to be running into a strange issue where if $.getJSON can't find the .json file, subsequent calls to the function don't seem to do anything
[01:53:00] <nimblecoin> does that make sense?
[01:53:44] <nimblecoin> do i need to add some kind of error handler
[01:55:54] <nimblecoin> the code is pretty simple http://jsfiddle.net/c3LSv/
[01:56:43] <nimblecoin> if orders.json does not exist the first time, if i call getOrders() again once the file is there, it doesn't seem to read it
[01:56:57] <nimblecoin> var orderbook stays empty
[01:59:02] <systemfault> nimblecoin: That’s weird code… but it’s difficult to help with so little information.
[01:59:36] <nimblecoin> what more information can I provide?
[02:00:43] <puchacz> hi, I have a toolbar at the top, fixed; z-index:99. the whole body is shifted down: $("body").css("padding-top", ($("#learning-toolbar").height() + 55) + "px");  now, the problem is that anchor links make page scroll to position anchors at the very top, below the toolbar. somebody here recommended I fix it with offset() and scrollTop(), but I don't know exactly how. any hints please?
[02:01:04] <puchacz> below the toolbar - I mean UNDER the toolbar
[02:01:19] <systemfault> nimblecoin: I don’t know… really. 1) Line 2 is a global variable since it’s not prefixed with “var”…. 2) getOrder uses an async function but doesn’t take a callback/return a promise
[02:01:30] <systemfault> nimblecoin: There isn’t much more to say about that code.
[02:02:38] <puchacz> there are elements that have <a name="X"> and then links like <a href="#X">, like in wikipedia Table of Contents
[02:02:50] <nimblecoin> this would be the same http://jsfiddle.net/c3LSv/1/
[02:03:40] <nimblecoin> so if $.getJSON can't find the file, what should the expected behavior be
[02:03:44] <systemfault> nimblecoin: Still, there isn’t anything wrong with that code. You’re trying to load a file that might or might not exists? How do you handle errors?
[02:04:00] <systemfault> nimblecoin: Ah! 2 seconds.
[02:04:03] <nimblecoin> from what I understand .getJSON doesn't give errors
[02:04:37] <seekhelp> need help with superfish module, nav-bar, first level main menu fine, 2nd level still good, 3level, vertical listing, how to display same horizontal list?
[02:04:59] <nimblecoin> I am a newb so the problem is probably more obvious to someone with experience ;)
[02:05:08] <systemfault> nimblecoin: Try something like http://jsfiddle.net/c3LSv/2/
[02:05:37] <nimblecoin> ah ok.  so if it fails, but doesn't have a handler, it just gets stuck in limbo or something
[02:05:57] <nimblecoin> maybe holds the variable hostage
[02:05:58] <systemfault> nimblecoin: No, when it doesn’t have a handler, nothing should happen :/
[02:06:57] <nimblecoin> ahhh
[02:07:02] <nimblecoin> i was reading old jquery documentation
[02:07:10] <nimblecoin> thank you
[02:07:16] <systemfault> You’re welcome
[02:09:44] <MagePsycho> i have a div which is hidden using style=“display:none;”, when i click on some element to make it visible: someclick function { jQuery(‘#hidden-div-element).show() }
[02:10:07] <MagePsycho> it doesn’t work.. inspecting the element i can see style tag is empty
[02:10:18] <MagePsycho> <div id=“” style>…</div>
[02:10:23] <MagePsycho> any idea guys?
[02:10:24] <slax0r> MagePsycho: is your selector ok?
[02:10:31] <MagePsycho> yeah it is
[02:10:36] <slax0r> and that function is being called?
[02:11:22] <MagePsycho> yeah
[02:11:30] <systemfault> MagePsycho: The page is parsed from top to bottom, is the code with the selector ran before the actual element it targets exist?
[02:11:37] <MagePsycho> style=“display:none” -> style when i call the function
[02:11:46] <MagePsycho> it should be style=“display:block"
[02:11:55] <systemfault> MagePsycho: If so, wrap it with a $(document).ready(function() { YOUR_CODE_HERE });
[02:13:13] <Uhkis> MagePsycho: could you show the actual markup and code, your syntax here is totally wrong
[02:15:35] <MagePsycho> <div class="top-signup-row" id="top-newsletter-wrapper-floater" style="display: none;”>..</div> is the div element hidden by default
[02:16:42] <systemfault> Fine
[02:16:49] <systemfault> Then the jQuery code?
[02:17:00] <systemfault> We all know what HTML is.
[02:17:57] <MagePsycho> http://pastebin.com/9RUfiFYT
[02:18:47] <systemfault> MagePsycho: Looks fine.
[02:19:10] <systemfault> MagePsycho: What version of jQuery do you use?
[02:19:40] <MagePsycho> jQuery v1.8.2
[02:19:51] <systemfault> Should be good...
[02:20:03] <Uhkis> yup, it's the markup (if that was copypaste)
[02:20:41] <systemfault> MagePsycho: Everything looks good man… :/
[02:20:51] <Uhkis> MagePsycho: fix that last quote of the <div>
[02:21:07] <MagePsycho> :( then why it’s not working..
[02:21:09] <Uhkis> it's not " it's ”
[02:21:13] <MagePsycho> Uhkis: what do you mean
[02:21:23] <Uhkis> not sure if your fonts can see that
[02:22:13] <MagePsycho> Uhkis: <div class="top-signup-row" id="top-newsletter-wrapper-floater" style="display: none;”> where to fix
[02:22:22] <Uhkis> MagePsycho: last "
[02:22:56] <Uhkis> http://i.imgur.com/KkcDsbt.png
[02:23:33] <systemfault> Would be fun if it’s just that :)
[02:24:24] <MagePsycho> nope :(
[02:24:24] <systemfault> OH NOES, we’re 666!
[02:24:43] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/8ZAP5/1/ vs. http://jsfiddle.net/8ZAP5/2/
[02:24:45] <MagePsycho> i will show you the live demo, just a minute
[02:24:55] <Uhkis> jsfiddle thinks it's the strange wannabe quote ;-)
[02:26:24] <MagePsycho> in my editor i ddin’t see any differentce.. just copy pasting from yours if that makes any difference
[02:36:25] <seekhelp> am I asking at the wrong place? if yes, pls advise. need help with superfish module, nav-bar, first level main menu fine, 2nd level still good, 3level, vertical listing, how to display same horizontal list?

[02:43:10] <puchacz> hi again, I thought anchors could be defined only with <a name="Reproductive_system">, but I see in wikipedia (article about insects) it is <span class="mw-headline" id="Reproductive_system">Reproductive system</span>
[02:43:14] <puchacz> how does it work please?
[02:49:46] <puchacz> ok, I just learned any ID is a target for # style link
[02:50:29] <puchacz> $(whatever).click - if I onvoke it many times, do I install multiple handlers?
[02:50:37] <puchacz> or previous handle gets disconnected?
[02:51:35] <systemfault> puchacz: It installs multiple handlers.
[02:51:47] <puchacz> thanks
[02:52:37] <systemfault> puchacz: Also… name(For <a>nchors is the old way to define targets, use ids.
[02:52:52] <puchacz> systemfault: I just learned about IDs :-)
[02:53:02] <puchacz> being targets for # style links
[03:25:24] <sadtaco> Ehh how do I find how far down something is in a scrollable element? .offset() and position() are both getting it from how far down they are of the top of element or page
[03:28:23] <sadtaco> nevermind got it
[04:45:32] <jonkristian> I have an input with name="attachment[{{ $attachment['id'] }}][options]" , options will be serialized so i was wondering how i could add to options with jquery, for instance: name="attachment[{{ $attachment['id'] }}][options][added]" ?
[06:22:30] <jaccob> you can use regex in jquery selectors, like for id="something-someMore" you can select using $('[id^=something-]')
[06:23:12] <brunoais> jaccob, That's not really regex
[06:23:25] <brunoais> that's a simple string comparison. It just means that it starts like that
[06:23:36] <solta> hello. does anyone know how can i send additional parameters to url after a row is saved in jqgrid by hitting Enter key ?
[06:24:20] <jaccob> brunoais, really, I could swear it is regex
[06:24:39] <brunoais> ;)
[06:24:55] <jaccob> brunoais, like in regex, square brackets means something about boundaries, and ^ means starts with
[06:25:16] <brunoais> jaccob, it's just some borrowed syntax from regex
[06:25:33] <brunoais> It's nothing like regex... at all
[06:25:36] <jaccob> brunoais, do by chance have  link for docs about it?
[06:26:08] <brunoais> jaccob, http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors
[06:26:43] <brunoais> jaccob, for example:
[06:26:49] <brunoais> these are equal
[06:27:05] <brunoais> div[class~="yay"]
[06:27:07] <brunoais> div.yay
[06:27:23] <brunoais> the dot is just sugar syntax :)
[06:27:39] <jaccob> brunoais, thx
[06:27:45] <brunoais> ^^

[07:24:22] <dwarder> is there a browser for ios that can show javascript debug info?
[07:26:54] <Hyperking> i have this Sun May 04 2014 10:19:27 GMT-0400 (EDT) and need to show  this Sun May 04 2014
[07:27:18] <Hyperking> looking for a simple way to remove the time
[07:28:37] <walidvb> Hyperking: did you find?
[07:29:05] <Hyperking> walidvb: find what?
[07:29:08] <dwarder> is there a browser for ios that can show javascript debug info?
[07:29:12] <dwarder> like google chrome's console
[07:29:12] <walidvb> your date thing?
[07:29:16] <walidvb> dwarder: safari
[07:29:16] <dwarder> and errors
[07:29:20] <Hyperking> not yet
[07:29:31] <dwarder> walidvb: how?
[07:29:38] <dwarder> walidvb: on IOS?
[07:30:04] <walidvb> plug to your comp, open safari, in the develop menu ur iphone will show up
[07:30:29] <dwarder> walidvb: i don't have 'comp
[07:30:35] <dwarder> walidvb: i have ipad
[07:30:48] <walidvb> you need a computer, too
[07:30:49] <dwarder> walidvb: i don't want remote debug
[07:31:01] <walidvb> dwarder: then I don't think it's possible
[07:31:06] <walidvb> except using alert() :P
[07:31:11] <dwarder> haha
[07:31:34] <walidvb> Hyperking: http://momentjs.com/
[07:31:48] <walidvb> dwarder: is remote debug not good enough?
[07:32:06] <Hyperking> walidvb: without a plugin
[07:32:24] <walidvb> well, http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp
[07:33:19] <Hyperking> walidvb: i just went there myself. given it a go
[07:34:24] <walidvb> well, in the d=Date() that gets returned, you can then myDate = d.getDate() + d.getFullYear() etc to get your format
[07:36:15] <dwarder> walidvb: i don't have mac or another pc
[07:36:26] <walidvb> well...
[07:36:34] <walidvb> so.. you're dev'ing on your ipad..?!
[07:36:37] <dwarder> walidvb: i have ipad and ipod that is all
[07:36:46] <dwarder> walidvb: right using ssh
[07:36:54] <walidvb> right..
[07:37:10] <walidvb> ok. hm i don't know how to help you, then.
[07:37:17] <dwarder> walidvb: ok, thanks
[07:37:22] <Hyperking> walidvb: calling toDateString() to my date var worked
[07:38:02] <walidvb> Hyperking: there you go  :)
[07:38:10] <dwarder> walidvb: there is a firebug lite that i could inject into my code i guess
[07:38:22] <dwarder> walidvb: the quesiton is will i be able to see the errors
[07:38:30] <walidvb> dwarder: but i doubt any ios browser will output the errors.
[07:38:48] <walidvb> dwarder: but the only way to go is to use alerts
[07:39:33] <dwarder> walidvb: looks like it was possible before ios 6
[07:40:05] <dwarder> walidvb: http://maisonbisson.com/post/14447/step-by-step-turn-on-the-iphone-ipads-web-debugging-console/
[07:40:40] <walidvb> right, but this has now moved to remote, afaik
[07:50:24] <walidvb> i'm ready to pay for someone to debug my site on iphone
[07:50:32] <walidvb> http://collinfontaine.ch/app/
[07:50:43] <walidvb> it bugs on resize / orientation change
[07:55:48] <frank_o> walidvb: jqm includes a iOS Orientation Change Fix
[07:56:04] <walidvb> frank_o: i'm not using jqm
[07:56:42] <frank_o> walidvb: "iOS Orientation Change Fix" smh
[07:58:12] <walidvb> frank_o: ?
[07:58:29] <walidvb> should i look at that? even though i'm not using jqm?
[08:13:24] <Hyperking> I need help comparing an attribute value with current date and adding a css class to an element http://plnkr.co/edit/tZzYkEGeWbDCpA1yXq7v
[08:14:09] <walidvb> Hyperking: leave the datetime attr as full date
[08:15:14] <Hyperking> meaning with the time info at end?
[08:15:44] <walidvb> yes, it's usually better to leave it like that, like this you can easily create a date from it, not losing info
[08:35:47] <walidvb> how can i get the proper size of ios safari height?
[09:29:35] <bigsky> hi all
[09:29:42] <bigsky> anybody here?
[09:30:37] <shoky> .
[09:42:52] <bakflash> hello - I've tried to get a JSON string result of a php file. But it is empty. So my question is, is this the correct way to get a result of php(my php file has no classes/functions it just returns a string): $.get("foo.php",function(data) { console.info(data); });
[09:59:14] <brunoais> bakflash, you have to tell it that it is a JSON response
[09:59:31] <brunoais> then jQuery will know that it needs to parse it somehow
[10:01:08] <walidvb> bakflash: and are you sure your php returns an answer?
[10:01:57] <brunoais> walidvb, it must be. What we don't know if what it is returning
[10:02:08] <brunoais> *is what it
[10:12:02] <bakflash> walidvb: fixed it. I had to echo it :)
[10:12:25] <bakflash> but now I've another problem.. How would I append something to the body? $('body').append("foobar");  doesn't work for me :/
[10:16:08] <walidvb> bakflash: !plknr
[10:16:22] <walidvb> !fiddle
[10:16:26] <walidvb> !jsfiddle
[10:16:29] <bakflash> hehe
[10:16:33] <walidvb> bakflash: post your code smwh :P
[10:16:38] <bakflash> well it works in a fiddle for me already :(
[10:16:48] <walidvb> but that should work, if you have jquery
[10:16:53] <walidvb> what does the console say?
[10:17:01] <bakflash> nothing :o
[10:17:23] <bakflash> http://pastebin.com/6AukDTKW
[10:17:35] <bakflash> well it's stripped down ofc, but even this example wont work for me this is kinda odd
[10:17:37] <walidvb> and "foobar" doesn't get appended to <body>?
[10:17:57] <walidvb> wrap it in $(document).ready(function(){your_function()})
[10:18:29] <bakflash> aaah!
[10:18:48] <bakflash> thanks! :)
[10:18:54] <walidvb> :)
[10:19:09] <walidvb> jsfiddle provides that as an option, which might be why you overlooked it
[10:19:33] <bakflash> yeah, prolly
[10:19:47] <bakflash> yeah true.. it was in onload
[10:20:05] <bakflash> still new to this web dev thing.. ;)
[10:22:31] <walidvb> :)
[10:31:51] <briefchain> what does $('img',html) mean?
[10:32:04] <briefchain> give me first img within html?
[10:33:55] <brunoais> briefchain, that depends of that is the "html" variable
[10:34:17] <briefchain> brunoais: its html
[10:35:19] <brunoais> briefchain, there's nothing called "html" defined by default
[10:35:30] <brunoais> there can be some exeptions in some browser
[10:35:34] <brunoais> but that's not in the spec
[10:36:01] <brunoais> do not rely on it
[10:37:03] <briefchain> brunoais: html is filled correctly
[10:37:14] <briefchain> not by the browser but externally
[10:37:17] <briefchain> it contains html code
[10:37:56] <brunoais> briefchain, Hum... In that case, I don't know
[10:38:00] <brunoais> try reading the manual
[10:38:11] <briefchain> how is this selector called?
[11:24:28] <supsup> sup
[12:16:34] <Deele> hey
[12:19:48] <wa5ted> is there anyway to use :contains
[12:19:56] <wa5ted> and eclusively serach for a string
[12:19:58] <wa5ted> asin
[12:19:59] <wa5ted> if something contains 4
[12:20:04] <wa5ted> but i want to select 4
[12:20:09] <wa5ted> elements that contain 4
[12:20:12] <wa5ted> but not somethign like 14
[12:20:16] <wa5ted> any ideas?
[12:20:54] <Deele> seems like a search to not problem that should not exist
[12:21:41] <Deele> better explain why you need such a thing
[12:22:04] <wa5ted> well i have a calander
[12:22:09] <wa5ted> calendar*
[12:22:34] <wa5ted> i need to search through the days and if the curretn month tha tis showing contains the curretnd ay (today beng the 4th)
[12:22:39] <brunoais> wa5ted, use data-* attributes
[12:22:40] <wa5ted> then it gets a special class added to it
[12:22:52] <Deele> exactly
[12:22:54] <wa5ted> brunoais: is there anyway to just seatch
[12:22:56] <wa5ted> search
[12:23:02] <Deele> no, you should not do that
[12:23:03] <wa5ted> this isnt exactly a jquery only project
[12:23:07] <brunoais> search for what? content inside tags?
[12:23:11] <wa5ted> yea
[12:23:16] <brunoais> that's crazy
[12:23:17] <wa5ted> strictly 4
[12:23:18] <Deele> iterate over every element and set data-date = "14"
[12:23:18] <wa5ted> and not 14
[12:23:26] <lericson_> a[data-date=4]
[12:23:33] <lericson_> is the css selector you're looking for
[12:23:33] <wa5ted> its a meeor project
[12:23:35] <wa5ted> meteor
[12:23:56] <brunoais> wa5ted, use data-* attributes
[12:24:04] <wa5ted> kk
[12:24:35] <wa5ted> brunoais: but to be curious (im doign the data- atribute stuff now)
[12:24:40] <wa5ted> is there not exclusive search
[12:24:46] <wa5ted> like a sort of regex i could use?
[12:25:19] <brunoais> wa5ted, there was. It was then removed from the DOM for being too innefficient, badly specified and it was not doing as expected
[12:25:30] <wa5ted> kk
[12:25:34] <wa5ted> interesting
[12:25:42] <wa5ted> i see a plugin or somethign to be built here :P
[12:25:44] <wa5ted> just kidding
[12:56:23] <Hyperking> can an element attribute be arbitrary when using defining a selector?
[12:56:53] <Hyperking> var abc = $('div[data]');
[12:57:12] <sc_> like $("#"+variable)?
[12:57:24] <jphase> Hyperking: that would select all <div data></div> tags
[12:57:35] <jphase> if by arbitrary you mean without a value, then yes
[12:58:12] <Hyperking> right, but why not here http://jsfiddle.net/VZYzE/
[12:59:01] <jphase> Hyperking: it does select that div
[12:59:27] <jphase> if you console.log(abc); you'll see the div with the data attribute
[13:01:42] <Hyperking> jphase: not showing in the results
[13:03:08] <jphase> Hyperking: exhibit A:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/VZYzE/1/
[13:33:54] <lonejack> Hello, does anyone know when will become avaliable the version 1.11 of the Ui ?
[13:35:26] <abishek> is there a simple way to check if atleast one checkbox is checked http://jsbin.com/hivot/1/edit or should I use a loop to check?
[13:47:34] <Azrael_-> hi
[13:48:44] <Azrael_-> for setting up validations in a form i can use e.g. class="digits" but i can't find the documentation reference for this behaviour. want to look up all options. can you give me a hint?
[14:03:30] <bigsky> hi all
[14:03:56] <Manaus> hi bigsky
[14:08:03] <jphase> Azrael_-: that's quite out of context. can you elaborate?
[14:08:19] <noober3> i have a div that contains an image. is there a way to select the area in the div around the image but not including the image?
[14:08:55] <jphase> noober3: put another div/span/whatever around that image and select that?
[14:10:14] <noober3> i don't want to select the image, but the area to the left and area to the right of it.
[14:10:34] <jphase> noober3: then you need elements to the left and right of it to select
[14:11:25] <noober3> so you mean i have to make div containting a div for the left, a div for the right and a div for the image?
[14:11:44] <Azrael_-> jphase: i've got a working form which validates an input with class="digits" just fine. wanted to look it up again what other options i had but couldn't find an appropriate documentation
[14:11:52] <jphase> noober3: if you want to select some area to the left and right of something, then you'll need something to the left and right of it to select, yeah
[14:13:27] <noober3> i just tried making a container div with width: 100% then a left div and right div with 10% and a image div with width: 80% but it seems to overflow, any ideas on how to fix this?
[14:13:49] <jphase> Azrael_-: not sure how you expect help with that. "I am validating a form with class="digits" and want to find other options". that's VERY vague. can you provide anything else, for example, "I'm using the jQuery validation plugin and am doing ______ with a form .digits and need to do ____" ?
[14:14:09] <jphase> it's to the point where it's nonsensical - no offense
[14:14:41] <jphase> noober3: sounds css related
[14:15:14] <noober3> ok thanks for the help
[14:15:40] <Azrael_-> ok, rephrasing: i'm using the validation plugin, have a form with an input with class="digits" and when i run $("form").validate() it validates the input just fine. i'm looking for a reference what other classes jquery validation plugin supports in this context of an input element
[14:15:50] <Azrael_-> does this make my intention clearer?
[14:18:30] <jphase> Azrael_-: .validate() will run validation based on the form. classes/attributes on each input such as "required" or "pattern" will tell the validation plugin how to validate it. check out the API docs on that plugin, they're all there
[14:19:31] <Azrael_-> and in the documentation i find tons of references for setting the rules in the validate-function, can't find anything appropriate by using classes
[14:27:37] <Hyperking> at my wits end. trying to add a class to an element with attribute value according to conditional. http://jsfiddle.net/bRt9L/1/
[14:28:22] <__joshua__> Hyperking: are you sure you can use > operators with a date?
[14:28:34] <__joshua__> maybe you should convert to a number first
[14:28:47] <Manaus> can I attach a property to $(this), like $(this).cars = 10 ?
[14:29:01] <__joshua__> date.getTime()
[14:29:30] <__joshua__> Manaus: yes, BUT.... if you want to requery it later, you should $(this).data('cars', 10);
[14:30:40] <Manaus> thanks __joshua__
[14:35:00] <__joshua__> Hyperking: did that work for you?
[14:35:46] <Hyperking> still investigating. but operators can be used
[14:36:12] <Hyperking> trying to do this simple task without adding an external library
[14:36:31] <__joshua__> operators can be used on a datestring?
[14:36:35] <__joshua__> are you REALLY sure?
[14:37:07] <__joshua__> yes, strings have a lexigraphical ordering.  but this doesn't correspond to date ording.
[14:38:25] <Hyperking> so instead i should use numeric format?
[14:38:38] <__joshua__> use getTime()
[14:39:20] <__joshua__> but first construct a date object FROM the string
[14:40:17] <Hyperking> how would getTime() be applied?
[14:40:57] <__joshua__> firstly your strings are NOT in a ISO format,
[14:41:09] <__joshua__> so you can't easily turn them into a date. YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
[14:41:32] <__joshua__> so, we have to regex it probably
[14:41:55] <Hyperking> i must take a break before my head explodes.
[14:42:13] <__joshua__> Hyperking: let me send you a fiddle in a few minutes
[14:43:21] <Hyperking> i have a static site with events. I want to use jquery to simply mark todays events, past event and future events using jquery
[14:43:56] <Hyperking> the html has a data element for each event in Fri June 04 2014  format
[14:44:40] <Hyperking> what you are suggesting is to format it in iSO Format to use operators to compare values. correct?
[14:45:32] <__joshua__> no
[14:45:51] <__joshua__> format in ISO, so you can construct date objects, that can then be compared
[14:51:29] <__joshua__> Hyperking: http://jsfiddle.net/bRt9L/2/
[14:55:04] <__joshua__> Hyperking: new Date();  (right now) will have hours and minutes etc components.  you will want to zero those.
[15:03:30] <opus_> hello. when I run a selector, even if I sepcify a bunch of > div.yada > div.Main > nth-child(4) > etc, jquery returns results for stuff all over the page and not specific to what i want
[15:03:54] <opus_> What am I doing wrong?
[15:03:59] <ryorky1> can someone tell me where I am going wrong with my code here.  Here is my fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/w94aF/
[15:04:24] <ryorky1> it always returns undefined
[15:07:49] <opus_> ryorkyl looks like your api call isn't working
[15:11:23] <opus_> i manuualy tested the api and it works in the browser
[15:17:33] <CoDEmanX> do trigger() or triggerHandler() ever fake native events?
[15:18:51] <CoDEmanX> it looks like they work for jquery event listeners only
[15:19:02] <CoDEmanX> a raw dispatchEvent() does work however
[15:23:52] <LoneStar99> anyone see anything wrong with this -> $('.pkg-indy').hide();  ??
[15:25:16] <CoDEmanX> LoneStar99: no?
[15:25:31] <CoDEmanX> should hide all elements with class .pkg-indy
[15:26:00] <CoDEmanX> do you use $(document).ready()?
[15:26:08] <CoDEmanX> or .on(...) ?
[15:27:37] <jphase> s/.pkg-indy/pkg-indy
[15:28:43] <CoDEmanX> is it an element?
[15:30:12] <LoneStar99> CoDEmanX: do I need to place a .pkg-indy {  display:block; }  in css for it to function correctly?
[15:30:44] <LoneStar99> CoDEmanX: yeah weird issue
[15:31:44] <CoDEmanX> no you don't
[15:31:52] <CoDEmanX> but maybe it has a different name?
[15:32:00] <CoDEmanX> should be like
[15:32:09] <CoDEmanX> <div class="pkg-indy">...</div>
[15:32:15] <CoDEmanX> no . in class name!
[15:32:56] <LoneStar99> found the issue,  i have an append and the class is appended so need to add hide(); after
[16:29:37] <Sal> hi
[16:31:09] <Sal> is there a way to know the div nearest to top:70px when scrolling up and down a list of divs?
[17:17:09] <Hyperking> is there such a thing as getElementsByAttribute()?
[17:19:02] <seich> Hyperking: How about using a document.querySelectorAll()?
[17:20:57] <Hyperking> seich: what if it's an attribute?

[19:35:16] <bowenac_> anyone know how I can check if an ajax action was finished?
[19:35:31] <bowenac_> or success or when it is done
[19:36:08] <bowenac_> this is outside the ajax file, as I do not know where this is coming from... but on the same page I need to trigger something when the ajax is done
[19:46:08] <Jattenalle> bowenac_, one sec
[19:47:12] <Jattenalle> $.ajax({url:'some url whatever'}) .done(function(data){ code here! });
[19:47:19] <Jattenalle> there's also .fail
[19:47:46] <Jattenalle> if you mean to trigger something when all ajax calls on a page, out of your control, are done.. i dont think that can be done
[19:51:31] <bowenac_> like I know the action woocommerce_update_order_review
[19:51:56] <bowenac_> Im removing a shipping option if specific states are selected from a drop down
[19:52:18] <bowenac_> but after the user fills out everything else, the order review gets updated using ajax, which then causes the shipping option to reset lol
[19:52:33] <bowenac_> So I need to do this after the ajax completes
[19:52:43] <bowenac_> or do it when they click on the shipping options select field
[19:53:07] <bowenac_> which is what I am doing right now but it seems a bit clunky you can see it for a split second and then it dissapears haha
[19:53:59] * Jattenalle shrugs

[22:05:41] <ElisaCt> Hello guys!
[22:06:18] <ElisaCt> I'm having some problems with this bit of code, some brain around here? I want to load a content through the .load function, but I want to do it more automatically.  >>> http://pastebin.com/tycx147k
[22:10:20] <ElisaCt> anyone?
[22:15:39] <ElisaCt> someboy?
[22:19:12] <Uhkis> i don't really get your problem
[22:23:24] <ElisaCt> Uhkis: I want to make it more automatic
[22:23:43] <ElisaCt> instead of me writing the name of the file (i.e: game.html) I would like to use something more like "this"
[22:24:10] <ElisaCt> something that takes the name of the link from the link itself, maybe if the link is <a href="#" data="file.html" id="file">FILE</a>
[22:24:17] <ElisaCt> but I have no idea how to get to the data out
[22:26:15] <Uhkis> $('#yourlink').text() would get you the link name
[22:26:15] <AntEater> <a href="#" data-file="game.html">GAME</a>    $(this).data("file")
[22:26:39] <Uhkis> and that would get the data-file attribute
