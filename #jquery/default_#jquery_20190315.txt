[02:56:33] <MACscr> ok, so i this little mockup of a layout im wanting to do. I have what i want as far as layout and i have the bottom code editor set to toggle open and close, but i would love to when open, be able to manually resize the code editor area up and down. thoughts? https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/GexJBR
[02:59:38] <MACscr> nvm, jquery ui resizable() with north and sound handles
[03:11:25] <MACscr> well almost https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/GexJBR
[03:12:04] <MACscr> the drawer when open and than dragged up to make larger doesnt stay anchored to the bottom
[03:26:31] <shoky> MACscr: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/jJzqvB
[03:27:07] <shoky> some cosmetic changes of mine, and using this solution  https://stackoverflow.com/a/16027849/1098884
[03:30:52] <MACscr> shoky thanks
[04:55:55] <haroldjfks> hello, a question please: trigger an input as selected where the table row which contains this input radio also contains the text "something". How would you do it? Thanks
[05:11:19] <thykka> $([type="radio"]).each((_, $r) => if($r.text() === 'something') { $r.parents('tr').find('input').attr('selected', 'selected') })
[05:11:23] <thykka> something like that maybe
[05:12:06] <thykka> but it's unlikely that the radio element itself has text, so you'll want to find it's corresponding label or what have you
[05:15:56] <haroldjfks> thykka: ok, thanks
[06:08:36] <haroldjfks> hello, if a class appears on the page...I tried $("body").on('DOMSubtreeModified', ".myclass", function() but it doesn't work
[06:08:43] <haroldjfks> maybe isn't it the right method?
[06:31:38] <thykka> haroldjfks, that event is deprecated
[06:32:11] <thykka> should probably use these instead https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[12:41:30] <soda__hobart> Hi everybody, I'm having some trouble getting this ajax request to work properly.  I'm trying to send form data with HTTP PUT--I used serializeArray() to put the form data into an array, but I also need to include at least one query parameter, so I tried creating an object that has a key for the parameter and a key for the array, but I get a syntax error.  Here is my paste:  https://pastebin.com/kPE7bexY
[12:42:17] <taplar> concat is not a string method
[12:42:29] <taplar> "+" is the concatenation operator for strings
[12:43:44] <soda__hobart> taplar:  ah good to know, I'll fix that but I don't think it's the cause of the problem
[12:43:59] <taplar> actually that's a lie
[12:44:09] <taplar> there is a concat method, lol.  i guess i just always used +
[12:44:19] <taplar> any who, lets see...
[12:45:26] <taplar> so params is an object with target resources, and update data, which is set as the array of object for all the form data
[12:45:52] <soda__hobart> so I'm using Flask with Jinja2 templates, and I was doing some searching on the problem and I was thinking it might be unescaped special characters used by the template engine, but I don't think that's the case because I use them elsewhere between <script> tags and it works fine
[12:46:16] <taplar> What is the computed output of {{ mods.resourceURI }} ?
[12:46:17] <soda__hobart> taplar:  yep that's right.  targetResource is actually a URI to a single resource.
[12:46:42] <soda__hobart> taplar:  it's just a string containing the URI
[12:46:53] <taplar> right, but does it have quotes around it or no?
[12:47:12] <taplar> because if that command is associated with a pre-processor, that may be an issue
[12:47:43] <taplar> as { key: http://blahblahblah.com } is invalid object syntax
[12:47:44] <soda__hobart> hm, maybe if I put quotes around the brackets
[12:49:39] <soda__hobart> well, that got rid of the syntax error, so thanks!
[12:49:45] <taplar> awesome, :)
[12:49:52] <soda__hobart> still getting the 500 error, but I will have to take a look at my API maybe
[12:49:58] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're not binding to the form submit?
[12:52:39] <soda__hobart> robertmaxrees:  so the application is a bibliographic metadata editor, and it's got a master-detail interface with a tree-view and then a form for each metadata element and I'm trying to have it submit data automatically rather than having the user have to click "submit" each time they enter or change some values.
[12:53:15] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[12:53:22] <robertmaxrees> so then it won't necessarily be on $("#saveSubmit").click(function () { ?
[12:55:58] <soda__hobart> robertmaxrees:  yeah, exactly, I just set that up as a temporary thing for testing.  I want my "update_element" API method to be called when the user navigates to another element, or x number of milliseconds after data is entered or changed.
[12:57:41] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[12:58:32] <taplar> 300ms, bootstrap style, :D
[13:06:03] <soda__hobart> Is that good or bad?  Haha!  Honestly, I know very little about front-end stuff.  I think eventually I will try to make a single-page app, but they are the devil.
[13:14:18] <taplar> sorry spaced out.  which part?
[13:14:31] <taplar> soda__hobart: ^
[13:15:58] <soda__hobart> taplar:  like updating every so often, would that be really slow?  I don't imagine too many people would be using the app at the same time, though, if ever, haha.
[13:16:15] <taplar> it really depends upon the ramifications of the operation
[13:16:27] <taplar> which you would be more informed about than me
[13:16:35] <taplar> but take this as an example
[13:16:52] <taplar> one of the applications I work on is being turning into more of a front end app
[13:17:09] <taplar> and the web developers like you had the idea of making an update every time the user changed input
[13:17:13] <taplar> BUT
[13:17:32] <taplar> i know, as one of the backend developers, that a ramification of changing data, is that we tell other systems when things change
[13:17:52] <taplar> so, if the frontend saves every keystroke, that's A TON of messages to other systems
[13:17:56] <taplar> === not good
[13:18:14] <taplar> so we had to tell them, no you can't do that
[13:18:51] <taplar> so you have to be aware of what work you are causing for your system by the UI you implement
[13:21:39] <robertmaxrees> ^ or modify your backend with a messaging and queueing service.  or find some other way to handle all of that.
[13:22:51] <taplar> we do use a queueing service, but when you queue, that delays the processing of messages if you flood the queue
[13:24:04] <robertmaxrees> absolutely.  we're very familiar with the pains you're talking about :) changing some tables kick off cascading updates to others and clear some caches and all kinds of crazy stuff.
[13:24:27] <taplar> egh
[13:24:53] <robertmaxrees> infrastructure when you've got 1.5 mil skus on just one site is A Thing™ :)
[13:25:25] * taplar goes to count his skus
[13:26:15] <taplar> :D
[13:27:08] <taplar> 4.4 mil, but we never perform an update to the majority of them all at once
[13:28:10] <soda__hobart> taplar: interesting, thanks for the insights.  Right now the system is pretty simple, it's just de-serializing JSON to Python objects, performing some simple operations, then serializing to JSON and XML.  But I want to have some useful autocompletes and validators for the GUI, stuff like Library of Congress Subject Headings--which is a much bigger list than could be shipped with front-end JS...
[13:29:19] <taplar> ok, so if the impact on other systems isn't a big thing, then that's less of a worry.  it then more becomes a concern with user experience
[13:30:10] <taplar> and also making sure that users are cool with their updates taking affect at whatever automated point in time you implement
[13:31:07] <robertmaxrees> also make sure you take into account long-running queries - you wouldn't want races to hit where an older request from the client overwrites data from a newer one.
[13:31:14] <taplar> ^^^
[13:31:21] <taplar> and network latency is a thing
[13:45:58] <taplar> oooh, it's back up in the 50s. :D
[14:25:50] <z1haze> does addClass return the jquery object?
[14:26:01] <taplar> yes
[14:26:52] <z1haze> hmm, alright thanks. gotta see what im goofin up
[16:24:00] <McJohn> Question on $.when.apply
[16:24:21] <taplar> sup
[16:24:29] <McJohn> if there are multiple deferreds, I get an array back; if there’s just one, I get the object.
[16:24:35] <McJohn> Am I nuts?
[16:24:47] <taplar> nope
[16:25:08] <taplar> one of those weird things
[16:25:29] <McJohn> Thanks, good to know
[16:25:49] <McJohn> Right pain that is
[16:40:28] <aro> i am using sortable - and for some reason, every time i drag it over the receiving zone it drops
[16:40:35] <aro> Even though I havent let go of the mouse button
[16:40:44] <aro> are there any limitations to sortable that I am not aware of?
[16:41:51] <taplar> you doing something similar to https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#empty-lists
[16:41:53] <taplar> ?
[16:42:02] <aro> one of the lists is empty, yes
[16:42:16] <aro> oh snap
[16:42:19] <aro> how did i miss this
[16:43:18] <aro> Thank you so much!
[16:43:25] <taplar> :D
[16:43:39] <taplar> glad that helped, otherwise my knowledge of jqui is so low, lol
[16:44:51] <aro> :)
[16:45:02] <aro> Except now it wont drop in there, but I can try to figure that out
[16:45:05] <aro> thanks again!
[16:45:15] <taplar> np
[16:45:47] <aro> Is tehre a way to not remove an item from source list when moving it to target?
[16:46:00] <taplar> iirc, there's a copy option?
[16:46:02] <aro> Like say i wanted to drop multiple of the same thing in the target
[16:46:22] <aro> i didnt see that
[16:47:04] <taplar> mmm, i could swear there was some option that when you dropped, it would leave it in the original list and make a copy of it in the new list
[16:47:34] <taplar> not seeing it in the api though
[16:47:38] <aro> i thought it was clone
[16:47:41] <aro> but that doesnt seem to work
[16:49:41] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3669039/jquery-sortable-keep-it-in-original-list
[16:50:02] <aro> ah ok
[16:52:35] <aro> So - where would I put my callbacks? Draggable or sortable?
[16:53:26] <taplar> that, not sure.  might have to try both and see which works
[16:53:39] <taplar> like i said, jqui isn't my strong suit, :)
[16:54:09] <aro> :)
[16:54:14] <aro> this helps a ton
[23:14:55] <MACscr> hmm, how do you think most live preview code editors properly evaluate when to do an update to the preview area? I mean, you wouldnt do it after every key press as code could be incomplete, etc
[23:15:16] <MACscr> Right now i just have a update preview button, but would love to remove the need for it
