[09:20:46] <ButtDog> What's the best way to determine if a file upload is completed using XMLHttpRequest?
[10:17:38] <nate> ButtDog: Add a custom header in your request?
[10:18:13] <nate> Otherwise I don't believe jQuery or XMLHttpRequest() add anything to explicitly distinguish source
[10:18:22] <ButtDog> Actually ended up adding an eventlistener xhr.upload.addEventListener('load')
[10:18:38] <ButtDog> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/upload
[10:21:08] <nate> Oh, you meant completed as in like, from the JS perspective, sorry
[10:21:12] <nate> I thought you meant from the backend lol
[13:22:12] <ButtDog> I'm trying to do something after an XMLHttRequest file upload adding an event listener to the upload object, but it's not firing for some reason: https://dpaste.org/kFWg#L l

[13:23:51] <robertmaxrees> that's now how you do that :) any reason you're not using $.ajax() instead?
[13:24:11] <robertmaxrees> oh, nvm.  you're already asking for help in ##javascript.  happy hacking! :)
[13:25:35] <ButtDog> Ya, asked in wrong channel
[13:25:43] <ButtDog> I thought this was #Javascript sorry
[13:26:35] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[13:27:32] <pavonia> Why are you using three different quote styles? :o
[13:28:20] <ButtDog> Hah! Good question
[13:28:29] <ButtDog> I suppose it's from copy/pasting
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> fwiw if you just used $.ajax(), you'd just do $.ajax().then(function() { /* your code here */ });
[21:12:23] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/P7MQ when i have this code present in my js file
[21:12:33] <primitivMedia> which is inside my submit function
[21:12:35] <primitivMedia> it causes
[21:12:40] <primitivMedia> Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[21:12:48] <primitivMedia> if i comment out these three lines it works fine
[21:20:04] <pavonia> What jQuery version?
[21:20:44] <primitivMedia> latest i think
[21:26:36] <pavonia> Unless your $form element is huge, this looks like a jQuery bug to me
[21:28:28] <pavonia> Do $form.find("[name='post_instagram']").filter(":input") etc. work?
[21:38:40] <primitivMedia> yes
[21:38:42] <primitivMedia> it does work
