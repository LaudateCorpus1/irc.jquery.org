[00:00:26] <jop008> I try this  element = $("#body")[0];
[00:00:26] <jop008>   if (element.classList.contains("is1920")) {
[00:00:27] <jop008>     alert ("class present");
[00:00:28] <jop008>   }
[00:00:39] <jop008> It seems that body has no class
[00:00:59] <Cork> well the selector you pasted before isn't about classes on body
[00:01:11] <Cork> also don't paste code in the channel
[00:01:37] <Cork> body.is1024 would be about classes on body
[00:01:40] <jop008> this is .is1024 body { font-size:1em; } a body class or am I wrong?
[00:01:46] <Cork> .is1024 body is about classes on <html>
[00:02:40] <jop008> So with .is1024 how to arrange font?
[00:03:03] <Cork> have you checked that you actually have the classes?
[00:03:05] <jop008> how can you see with .is9999 is active?
[00:03:24] <jop008> How to check if classes are present?
[00:03:33] <jop008> I try to
[00:03:34] <Cork> ...
[00:03:49] <Cork> grab the html element and check if it has them?
[00:04:26] <Cork> like i said, use the developer tools, source view or js
[00:04:27] <jop008> Like this   element = $("#body")[0];
[00:04:28] <jop008>   debugger;
[00:04:29] <jop008>   if (element.classList.contains("is1920")) {
[00:04:34] <Cork> ...
[00:04:40] <Cork> DON'T PAST CODE IN THE CHANNEL
[00:04:52] <jop008> You talk about html element
[00:04:55] <Cork> yes
[00:05:05] <jop008> what do you refer to?
[00:05:19] <Cork> you know the element you normally have on line 2 in every html file?
[00:05:30] <jop008> meta?
[00:05:31] <Cork> the '<html>' one
[00:06:24] <jop008> I don't understand line 2 of a file
[00:06:30] <Cork> uh...
[00:06:36] <jop008> normally include stuf
[00:06:42] <Cork> O_o'
[00:06:52] <Cork> are you messing with me?
[00:07:30] <jop008> No
[00:07:49] <Cork> ok what do you have on the first two lines in your html file?
[00:08:33] <jop008> I am not to allow to paste lines here making it hard
[00:08:38] <jop008> to explain
[00:08:48] <Cork> those two lines should be very easy to name
[00:08:52] <jop008> <!DOCTYPE html>
[00:08:53] <jop008> <html>
[00:08:53] <jop008> <head>
[00:08:56] <jop008> line 2 is empty
[00:09:03] <Cork> ...
[00:09:11] <Cork> try reading what you just pasted...
[00:09:39] <jop008> head is n't an element
[00:09:44] <Cork> ---
[00:09:56] <Cork> well it isn't line 2, but yes it is
[00:10:33] <jop008> head isn\t a dom element
[00:10:38] <Cork> yes it is
[00:10:45] <Cork> but it isn't the element i talked about
[00:10:47] <jop008> new to me
[00:10:55] <jop008> 10 years javascript experience
[00:11:14] <Cork> var h = document.createElement('head') works just fine
[00:11:44] <jop008> okay but how to use .is9999 ?
[00:11:49] <Cork> ...
[00:12:14] <Cork> well you could create random classes add them to random elements and hope it works...
[00:12:31] <Cork> or you could check the element i asked you to verify have the class your looking for
[00:13:13] <jop008> I try to follow page http://rezitech.github.io/syze/
[00:13:29] <Cork> sigh, what ever, do it your way
[00:13:35] <jop008> But I don't understand the ELEMENT
[00:15:13] <le_gars> Hello, How can  you use nokogiri to strip the content of p and br tags?
[00:15:24] <jop008> I don't understand you Cork
[00:16:24] <Cork> le_gars: are you sure you asked that in the correct channel?
[00:16:33] <shoky> jop008:   .is480  body { font-size:0.55em; }    means  a <body> element which is inside another element that has "is480" class.  e.g.:   <html class="is480"> <body> ... </body> </html>
[00:16:53] <le_gars> Cork: sorry no I did not :)
[00:17:08] <le_gars> good luck with manipulating the DOM ;)
[00:17:16] <Cork> :)
[00:20:41] <jop008> aha so my class wheren't avtive
[00:21:19] <jop008> but using <html class = "is9999"> how do I know the correct number to use?
[00:21:33] <jop008> is1024 or is320 for example
[00:21:57] <shoky> choose your favorite
[00:22:11] <jop008> but it depends on the device of the user
[00:22:21] <shoky> then do it based on that
[00:22:40] <jop008> so back were we started that was my point
[00:23:08] <shoky> using a plugin you dont know how to use? seems so
[00:29:46] <jop008> So where to put this line ? .is320  body { background-image: url(mobile-tall-128x128.png); }
[00:29:50] <jop008> in the head?
[00:32:10] <jop008> or withinhtml tag?
[00:36:11] <jop008> I now have <html body { background: no-repeat center center; } .is320  body { font-size :0.55em; } but no effect
[00:37:35] <jop008> also for othere screens added a css
[00:55:50] <aro_> what is the plugin that makes boxes kind of drop into place?
[00:58:49] <Relequestual> aro_ either this http://vnjs.net/www/project/freewall/ or http://masonry.desandro.com/ ?
[00:59:05] <shoky> tetris
[00:59:17] <shoky> oh, *plugin*
[01:00:01] <aro_> checking
[01:00:40] <aro_> the best way i can describe it, is every time a new row of boxes is appended to the bottom of the page, the first one slides up and stops, then the next one slides up and stops and so forth til it reaches the end of the row
[01:00:43] <aro_> then starts on the next row
[01:01:05] <Relequestual> don't know then sorry
[01:01:23] <shoky> gameboy->tetris  look no further
[01:01:23] <ghostlines> is there a way to halt execution until a specific function completes?
[01:01:45] <aro_> gameboy tetris?
[01:01:55] <shoky> aro_ no not rly
[01:02:38] <aro_> ok
[01:03:35] <Whirl3d> aro, did you check the links Relequestual provided? I did and noticed that Masonry has a lot of fill effects that might work for you..
[01:03:36] <Whirl3d> http://tympanus.net/Development/GridLoadingEffects/index2.html
[01:03:42] <Whirl3d> Hey Shoky!
[01:03:44] <shoky> ghostlines: call the function. that will execute it until it completes.  if you have async stuff in there, they are run only after the function completes
[01:03:50] <shoky> heys Whirl3d ;p
[01:04:30] <Whirl3d> aro, specifically demo 2
[01:04:36] <ghostlines> ok thanks!
[01:04:41] <aro_> thanks :) will check it
[01:04:48] <aro_> thats it
[01:04:48] <aro_> !
[01:04:50] <aro_> thanks!
[01:05:06] <Whirl3d> thank Relequestual, he found it.
[01:05:16] <Relequestual> kl cheers Whirl3d =]
[01:07:42] <jop008> I have a body and there within I have a div page element it seems like this is done with a css since my body classes don't work
[01:08:36] <jop008> not true on another page it works fine also with a page tag
[01:14:32] <aro_> Whirl3d: you there
[01:14:59] <aro_> what scripts are required to make that work? the demo page doesnt really tell us what we need to do
[01:23:40] <seutje> aro_: masonry, imagesloaded, classie and AnimOnScroll, the latter seems to be written by codrops, but I can't find the repo in their githubs
[01:23:45] <seutje> sauce file says it's MIT though
[01:24:15] <seutje> nvm, here we go https://github.com/codrops/GridLoadingEffects
[01:37:08] <jop008> I have one page who is reponsive and aother it is not same approach on both pages
[01:37:19] <jop008> So how to debug this?
[01:37:25] <jop008> jquery mobile
[01:37:47] <jop008> the page is holding a form and the other page not
[01:38:20] <jop008> the form page doesn't react but also the title of the page is not reacting on different font size
[01:39:02] <Whirl3d> aro, they give you the source code. Did you check it out?
[01:40:21] <Whirl3d> gnite all.
[01:41:01] <jop008> this is doing nothing <style>body { font-size:20em; }
[01:41:15] <jop008> size fo font stays the same
[01:47:50] <ghostlines> maybe something is overruling it, add an !important maybe
[01:50:20] <jop008> I have this <div class='txtwrapper'> .txtwrapper{   font-size: 20px; } textwrapper most outside div
[01:50:29] <jop008> but no change in font size
[01:53:45] <jop008> So how to change the font size on jq mobile?
[01:58:08] <jop008> I try to follow this http://jsfiddle.net/DC2Ry/ tet wrapper on my page but no success
[01:58:33] <jop008> it looks like css on the page is somewerhe else influenced
[02:05:33] <jop008> but where to look for?
[02:14:58] <jop008> my page is like this http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/86/ I can change the font size using the txtwrapper class
[02:15:17] <jop008> on my page it won't using the same html
[02:25:27] <lite_> xSo ive got this directive. I wish to slide an element in whenever a mouseover event occurs. the problem here is that if I mouse over the same element say 10-15 times in a row the animation is "chained" and will repeat itself the amount of times I moused over the element https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1b48bd97daf4f90cd663
[02:25:49] <seutje> `api stop
[02:25:49] <b-ot> seutje: .stop(): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[02:27:14] <seutje> lite_: not sure how it works with transit though
[02:28:29] <seutje> actually, looks like you can just pass queue: false;
[02:30:12] <lite_> thanks
[02:30:19] <lite_> looks like queue:false fid the trick
[02:38:30] <jop008> This my page http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/101/
[02:38:44] <jop008> I want to change fontsize using textwrapper
[02:38:57] <jop008> what ever I do the page stays the same
[02:39:06] <jop008> I can't see why
[02:45:52] <coRz> jop008, you should use media queries
[02:46:24] <jop008> I tied also
[02:46:50] <jop008> if I want it to change for all stuff do I need media queries?
[02:46:59] <coRz> ofc
[02:47:21] <coRz> and you have an override .ui-btn-text has a font-size too 15px
[02:47:30] <coRz> so your text-wrapper wont work
[02:47:35] <jop008> Why is this fiddle working? http://jsfiddle.net/DC2Ry/
[02:47:36] <coRz> unless you add !important
[02:48:01] <coRz> You have an override!!!
[02:48:32] <jop008> I use a responsive helper syze.min.js
[02:49:14] <jop008> in my css I have .is768  body { font-size:2em; }
[02:49:23] <coRz> jop008, theres 2 classes .ui-btn-text
[02:49:30] <jop008> which worked fine on one page but not in the example on fiddle
[02:50:15] <jop008> .ui-btn-text {     font-size: 15px; /* Play with font size of the text */ }
[02:50:37] <coRz> jop008, you want the txtwrapper class to change all font sizes in the page?
[02:50:39] <jop008> but it looks like css is ginored some how
[02:51:04] <jop008> yes
[02:51:15] <jop008> to make life easier
[02:52:10] <coRz> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/102/
[02:52:12] <coRz> done
[02:52:49] <jop008> clever solution
[02:53:42] <coRz> well its all about css hierarchy
[02:54:16] <coRz> the ui button wont even look at the txtwrapper rules because the the ui class is more relevant to the element than txtwrapper
[02:55:00] <coRz> then you need to make it more relevant so you add rules to those classes so if theres .txtwrapper above those classes then use the new rules
[02:55:02] <coRz> got it/
[02:55:03] <coRz> ?
[03:00:47] <jop008> Must I combine textwrapper with media queries?
[03:05:13] <Radditz> hello
[03:05:24] <Radditz> can someone give me an example of adding a new div element with a custom id
[03:05:31] <Radditz> to an already existing div id in the html
[03:05:56] <Cork> $('#id').append('<div id="something"></div>')
[03:06:14] <beasty> oh that's nasty :p
[03:06:26] <Cork> or $('#id').append($('<div>').attr('id, 'something'))
[03:06:33] <Cork> * $('#id').append($('<div>').attr('id', 'something'))
[03:06:58] <coRz> or var $newDiv = $("<div></div>").appendTo("somewhere"); $newDiv.attr("id", "woot");
[03:07:27] <Cork> or $('<div>').attr('id', 'something').appendTo('#id')
[03:07:28] <Cork> :)
[03:07:30] <coRz> lol
[03:07:31] <Cork> the list is long
[03:07:35] <coRz> yep
[03:08:21] <seutje> I usually prefer the appendTo method, as it allows you to store and chain on the element you created instead of the wrapper you're putting it in
[03:10:33] <SprkDev> How can I use the quicksand jquery plugin to filter my post item in wordpress?
[03:10:49] <coRz> dont they have an api?
[03:11:08] <coRz> check google before asking..
[03:11:40] <SprkDev> thats what I've already done.
[03:13:24] <mtlife> hey, is there any way with jquery to catch this .ajax error 'No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. ' ?
[03:14:14] <coRz> SprkDev, sry im not familiar whit that plugin
[03:14:58] <SprkDev> Do you know any other plugin which accomplished the same goal? I am simply trying to put a filter onto my page. If it looks fancy the better.
[03:17:20] <coRz> sec ill check
[03:17:40] <Cork> mtlife: i'm quite sure the fail/error callback is fired
[03:18:23] <mtlife> yes but I need to have an error status, I need to know if its 404 or that it really does exist but is denying the request because of CORS
[03:19:08] <coRz> SprkDev, this is what you want? http://www.developingtheweb.co.uk/quicksand-demo/
[03:19:55] <SprkDev> yes, I've tried that one. But even when I put the shortcode, I don't see it.
[03:20:00] <sacho_> mtlife, why is the origin 'null'?
[03:20:31] <mtlife> sacho_: I have no idea, that's what chrome reporting back... I haven't set origin to null manually.
[03:21:12] <Cork> mtlife: just bind a fail handler and see what status and the list you get in the callback
[03:21:20] <sacho_> mtlife, are you running this locally?
[03:21:52] <mtlife> sacho_ yes
[03:22:01] <Cork> ugg
[03:22:11] <Cork> so file:// is trying to access a server
[03:22:17] <Cork> that most likely won't ever work
[03:22:26] <Cork> cause it would be a security problem if it was
[03:22:26] <mtlife> ugh ofc... let me fire up localhost
[03:22:45] <Cork> + allowed
[03:23:26] <sacho_> mtlife, general rule of thumb, if you're running your own,trusted scripts locally, you want to run them with disabled security because of all the security restrictions
[03:23:41] <Cork> uh...
[03:23:50] <Cork> sacho_: that is a terrible suggestion
[03:24:02] <sacho_> why is it a "terrible suggestion"?
[03:24:02] <Cork> those restrictions are there for a reason
[03:24:19] <Cork> if you disable them you will be vulnerable to a lot of problems
[03:24:32] <Cork> and i'm not just talking about things from your code
[03:24:32] <sacho_> Yes, you'll be vulnerable to all the attacks you wrote against yourself.
[03:24:37] <Cork> no
[03:24:57] <Cork> you will be vulnerable to attacks from web to get into local system
[03:25:12] <sacho_> Uh, lol
[03:25:29] <mtlife> Well this is an interesting discussion..
[03:25:52] <Radditz> hello
[03:26:00] <Radditz> I am terribly sorry I am having connection problems
[03:26:01] <Radditz> and have no log
[03:26:06] <Radditz> how do I add an element ( append?)
[03:26:12] <Radditz> and how do I add style = " "
[03:26:14] <Radditz> thank you
[03:28:11] <Cork> ...
[03:28:12] <seutje> Radditz: append, prepend, appendTo, prependTo, insertBefore, ...
[03:28:25] <Radditz> I write directly
[03:28:33] <Radditz> <div id="foo" style ="bar" ?
[03:28:54] <Radditz> or there is a better way to do it?
[03:29:03] <Radditz> can I see the log? please
[03:29:03] <Cork> Radditz: http://pastebin.com/UQvBaH1W
[03:29:06] <seutje> "better" is a loaded word
[03:29:23] <Radditz> someone said that doing append("<div ... is nasty
[03:29:30] <Radditz> is there a dissadvantage into doing that?
[03:29:41] <Cork> yes and no
[03:29:47] <Cork> it is fine for shorter strings
[03:29:55] <Cork> for longer you most likely are doing it wrong
[03:30:10] <Cork> (keep your html in the html file, it makes everything much easier)
[03:30:48] <Radditz> I have to generate some stuff dynamically cork
[03:31:07] <Radditz> in my case I need a div with a certain id, and a style that I pass to something else
[03:31:08] <Cork> templating might be a nice solution then
[03:31:19] <Radditz> javascript has templates?
[03:31:28] <jop008> If I change size of text the ehader row shrinkks the buttons within the header don't shrink and become out of line. So how to avoid this?
[03:31:30] <Cork> ?g jqote2
[03:31:31] <b-ot> Cork: jQote2 – Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code → http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[03:31:36] <Cork> ?g mustash
[03:31:36] <b-ot> Cork: Mustash - devot:ee - Devoted to ExpressionEngine → http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/mustash
[03:31:46] <Radditz> well I'd have to talk about integrating that into the js library I think it's simpler to do append
[03:31:46] <Cork> ?g jquery underscore
[03:31:47] <b-ot> Cork: Underscore.js → http://underscorejs.org/
[03:31:50] <Cork> and so on
[03:32:18] <Cork> Radditz: you can build dom elements and append those, but be prepared that it is many many times slower
[03:32:36] <Cork> to actually generating and adding strings
[03:32:48] <Radditz> is there a stringbuffer in javasript?
[03:32:58] <Cork> stringbuffer?
[03:33:21] <Cork> not sure what you are looking for
[03:34:19] <Radditz> in java you have a stringbufer class or stringbuilder to build strings
[03:34:26] <Radditz> because strings are immutable it's faster that way
[03:34:31] <Radditz> you build a string then retrievei t
[03:34:43] <Cork> no need
[03:34:49] <Cork> just concat the strings
[03:34:57] <Cork> for easier to read you might want to use an array
[03:34:58] <Radditz> but you said it's slow
[03:35:06] <Cork> uh no
[03:35:11] <Cork> i said building dom is slow
[03:35:35] <Cork> var d = document.createElement('div'); d.id = 'something'; ...
[03:35:43] <Radditz> oh, right
[03:35:53] <Cork> var d = $('<div'); d.attr('id', 'something'); ...
[03:36:11] <Cork> it is much faster to build a string and insert that into the dom
[03:36:15] <Radditz> is this better than doing append("<div id = ..."> ?
[03:36:27] <Cork> it depends
[03:36:39] <Cork> if you build strings you can have xss problems
[03:36:54] <Cork> so there are situations where dom elemetns is worth the cost
[03:37:07] <Cork> ex if you add data from sources you don't control
[03:37:20] <Cork> like user input or third-party
[03:37:28] <Radditz> I dont use input on third party
[03:37:37] <Radditz> but the user could inject javascript I guess
[03:37:41] <Radditz> its related to server response
[03:37:52] <Radditz> the worse he can do is make a bad page
[03:37:53] <Cork> na javascript isn't the problem
[03:38:24] <Cork> the problem is something like $('id').append('<div="' + id + '"></div>');
[03:38:38] <Cork> where id comes from an input field or something in a response through the server
[03:38:42] <Cork> cause id coudl be something like
[03:39:25] <Cork> id = 'none"></div><script src="http://hackserver.com/attack.js"></script>';
[03:39:38] <Cork> opps
[03:39:46] <Cork> id = 'none"></div><script src="http://hackserver.com/attack.js"></script><div id="';
[03:39:50] <Radditz> id comes in a response from the server, but I guess it can be modified through the console
[03:40:07] <Cork> Radditz: you don't have to be affraid about the console
[03:40:17] <Radditz> I dont see how a user can hijack the server response
[03:40:21] <Cork> where the data you send from the server matters though
[03:40:22] <Radditz> unless they hijack the dns and so on
[03:40:58] <Cork> http://your-server.com/request.php?id=<the id to use>
[03:41:04] <Cork> then you could just craft the info
[03:41:12] <Cork> just an example
[03:41:40] <Radditz> I don't do that, but this is supposed to be used on internal networks anyway
[03:41:46] <Radditz> and I don't expose any data
[03:41:49] <Cork> uh...
[03:41:58] <Cork> Radditz: your missing the point entirely
[03:42:01] <Radditz> I mean you can't use my page to modify data in any way only access it
[03:42:07] <Cork> xss is not the user attacking you
[03:42:16] <Cork> it is a third party attacking your user through you
[03:42:19] <Radditz> you mean is someone compromises the connection they can inject stuff?
[03:42:22] <Cork> no
[03:42:51] <Radditz> I don't have any input fields ,I  have a javascript variable that is set as part of the dynamically generated response
[03:42:57] <Radditz> that I reuse ( no ajax)
[03:43:07] <Cork> cause you allow data to come from a request and then echo it out into the page without sanitizing it
[03:43:18] <Cork> Radditz: sure no input field
[03:43:25] <Cork> but where does the data you send out come from?
[03:43:27] <Cork> your data base?
[03:43:32] <Cork> *database
[03:43:41] <Cork> THAT is what matters
[03:43:44] <Radditz> yes
[03:43:58] <Cork> and it is generated info, not something inputed from somewhere else?
[03:44:10] <Radditz> it is data that exists in the databse, it's used to make charts
[03:44:20] <Cork> sigh...
[03:44:24] <Radditz> hm?
[03:44:30] <Cork> is the data in the database sanitized?
[03:44:44] <Cork> if no, then you need to sanitize it now
[03:44:52] <Radditz> I dont particularily control the databse, it's supposed to work for pretty much anything
[03:44:56] <Cork> if it is, then yes you can just concat a string and be safe
[03:44:59] <Radditz> you just configure the fields and it makes a query to get the data
[03:45:13] <Radditz> I read the fields and transform them to javascript numbers server side
[03:45:22] <Radditz> then send the response as javascript objects
[03:45:23] <Cork> Radditz: well then i would take them as unsanitized
[03:45:48] <Radditz> the server doesnt send strings back but numbers
[03:45:49] <Cork> and make sure to treat it as unsafe and make sure to carefully make sure it can't inject code
[03:46:03] <Cork> Radditz: you apparently don't know that
[03:46:05] <Radditz> it uses that system of objects translation
[03:46:12] <Cork> it is just what you are currently happening to get
[03:46:13] <Radditz> I get an Integer
[03:46:26] <Radditz> well since I have a java Integer object I can't send a string to the user
[03:46:33] <Cork> and you sure you can't ever get anything else from the server for that field?
[03:46:55] <Cork> every time i've asked about the integrity of the data you answer something else
[03:47:16] <Cork> you need to be sure you can't get malisush data into the string, cause then it can be used for xss
[03:47:19] <Radditz> I am sure I can't get anything else since I send it
[03:47:32] <Cork> no
[03:47:37] <Radditz> I do the query then I do object translation, then I work on a Integer object myself
[03:47:40] <Cork> just cause you send it doesn't mean it can't be
[03:47:44] <Cork> where it comes from does
[03:47:48] <Radditz> if it isn't an integer it will fail
[03:47:59] <Cork> ...
[03:48:01] <Radditz> iI have Integer in java, it can't be anything else
[03:48:13] <Radditz> unless the connection is compromise in the middle and someone sends something else
[03:48:17] <Radditz> the server will never send strings
[03:48:42] <Radditz> maybe I am not explaining this right
[03:49:00] <Radditz> if it fails to be parsed as an Integer there will be a server side exception way before the javascript response
[03:49:10] <Radditz> and a message will be shown saying an exception occured
[03:49:32] <Cork> Radditz: no you quite apparently doesn't know how to verify if the data is safe
[03:49:38] <Cork> you should most likley read up on it
[03:49:43] <Cork> so you know what to look out for
[03:49:44] <Radditz> on the server side?
[03:49:50] <Cork> from start to end
[03:50:02] <Cork> through the entire managing of the specific data
[03:50:03] <Radditz> well TBH I don't particularly care since I am not responsible for security
[03:50:08] <Radditz> but for generating charts and pie-charts
[03:50:16] <Cork> ...
[03:50:28] <Radditz> I don't do SQL queries directly I use an API provided to me that does object mapping in java
[03:50:37] <Radditz> It's not my fault if that api is compromised
[03:50:48] <Cork> Radditz: your missing the point my miles
[03:50:54] <Radditz> ok I don't understand then
[03:51:01] <Cork> your talking about data transfer and storage
[03:51:03] <Radditz> I dont see how an attack is possible
[03:51:06] <Cork> not source
[03:51:08] <Radditz> withot compromising teh connection
[03:51:21] <Cork> the SOURCE is what matters
[03:51:28] <Radditz> I am not responsible for storage, this system existed before I worked here,
[03:51:36] <Cork> ...
[03:51:39] <Cork> >_>
[03:51:43] <Radditz> AFAIK it is serialized to xml and validated against a schema
[03:51:45] <Cork> read again
[03:51:50] <Radditz> the source of what?
[03:51:52] <Cork> i said storage is NOT what matters >_<
[03:51:57] <Radditz> the server request?
[03:51:58] <Cork> where the data came from
[03:52:03] <Cork> when it was first generated
[03:52:09] <Radditz> the data I use?
[03:52:12] <Cork> not where it is stored and fetched
[03:52:17] <Cork> yes
[03:52:26] <Radditz> I generate it from a databse query
[03:52:29] <Cork> no
[03:52:33] <Cork> it is fetched through a query
[03:52:37] <Cork> where does it come from
[03:52:38] <Radditz> yes
[03:52:41] <Radditz> the query?
[03:52:57] <Cork> so the query magically generates data from thin air?
[03:53:00] <Radditz> its an http parameter on the selection, theoretically you can hijack it
[03:53:18] <Radditz> but it doesn't receive SQL queries but a subset of xpath queries so you can't delete anything or modify
[03:53:36] <Cork> Radditz: your thinking about sql injection
[03:53:41] <Radditz> but a user could inject other queries in the server request
[03:53:41] <Cork> Radditz: it is not xss
[03:54:13] <Cork> xss is where a site can attack a user by adding content to your page cause you don't sanitize it
[03:54:28] <Cork> *sanitize your input data
[03:54:50] <Radditz> I see
[03:54:58] <Radditz> it includes javascript ojects
[03:55:01] <Radditz> or only html ones?
[03:55:16] <Radditz> I don't parse anything on the client
[03:55:32] <Radditz> I dont send an ajax response, I generate dynamic javascript as part of a response
[03:55:36] <Radditz> it's still vurnerable?
[03:55:36] <Cork> Radditz: it is when you append things that could be parsed as html to the dom
[03:55:50] <Radditz> I don't read any user input on the client side
[03:55:50] <Cork> Radditz: again, it depends on where the data comes from
[03:55:57] <Radditz> it comes from a javascript variable
[03:56:03] <Cork> no
[03:56:04] <Cork> ...
[03:56:09] <Radditz> that is part of the server response
[03:56:13] <Cork> please stop mixing containers with source
[03:56:16] <Radditz> ok
[03:56:19] <Cork> a variable doesn't generate data
[03:56:22] <Cork> it contains it
[03:56:34] <Cork> user or administrators or scripts generate data
[03:57:54] <Radditz> I see I will google about it
[03:58:11] <Cork> Radditz: google about where your data comes from??
[03:58:17] <Radditz> about xss?
[03:58:18] <rightnow> Hello can i change $(".content").touchwipe({   to only trigger on the actual .content, not on the inner elements?
[03:58:26] <Radditz> I said my data comes from the server
[03:58:27] <Radditz> ...
[03:58:29] <Radditz> I generate it
[03:59:23] <Radditz> I have to go eat, I will come back
[03:59:42] <Radditz> Cork: I personally don't see how it can be abused, even if the databse has <tab> it won't be a valid integer
[04:04:42] <rightnow> My question is, is there a selector for like $('body') that does not trigger anything child elements?
[04:09:30] <lostlogix> good morning all!
[04:17:35] <Cork> rightnow: why use 'body' ?
[04:17:41] <Cork> just do document.body
[04:18:00] <Cork> rightnow: not sure what trigger you are talking about though
[04:22:12] <lacrymology> I need to make an interactive tutorial for my webapp. Something that shows a tooltip on a div until the user hovers over it, and then another one on a button until the users clicks on that, et-cetera. Does anyone know a tool or tested strategy to do that?
[04:24:16] <aro_> is there a jquery plugin that loads blocks of content in in a waterfall type manner
[04:45:29] <F1skr> I have a div with overflow: auto; is it possible to not scroll the whole page when I'm scrolling inside that div?
[04:46:01] <Cork> F1skr: that depends on the browser
[04:46:22] <Cork> but ya you could bind a scroll event listener on the element and dom something from there
[04:46:47] <Cork> though it would be a bit weird to scroll the parent from the scrollbar of the child
[04:47:13] <xec_> he said "not scroll the whole page" ;)
[04:47:22] <Cork> >_<
[04:47:35] <F1skr> I see, firefox does what the "right" thing, but chromium which I was testing in doesn't..
[04:47:46] <xec_> which i thought was the default behaviour, really
[04:48:18] <Cork> F1skr: are you scrolling with the scrollbar or with mousewheel or?
[04:48:36] <F1skr> mousewheel
[04:48:42] <xec_> F1skr: could you make a jsfiddle demo?
[04:49:22] <Cork> F1skr: you could try something like catching the mousewheel event and running event.stopPropagation()
[04:49:47] <Cork> though can't say i've ever seen this problem my self
[04:50:28] <F1skr> thanks guys, I don't think I will bother with this right now since it seems to be related how the different browsers handle this..
[04:55:49] <jop008> how to change the size of a label text?
[04:55:55] <jop008> on a form
[05:01:19] <jop008> when I do inspect element I see <label
[05:01:32] <jop008> how to attach css to that elemant?
[05:01:38] <jop008> Just label?
[05:02:36] <jop008> Yes just label!
[05:33:56] <aro_> has anyone had any experience with masonry?
[05:36:52] <Radditz> hello , is it possible to create a dom then only change it's id?
[05:36:53] <Radditz> before inserting it?
[05:37:16] <aro_> what kind of dom
[05:37:31] <Radditz> a html element I mean
[05:37:33] <Radditz> a divb
[05:37:34] <Radditz> div*
[05:37:48] <aro_> var $elem = $('<div></div>');
[05:37:56] <aro_> then use $elem.attr('id', 'whatever');
[05:37:59] <aro_> or .prop
[05:38:05] <aro_> dont remember which is the right one to use for that
[05:38:08] <Radditz> and it's mutable?
[05:38:15] <Radditz> I can modify it add it
[05:38:20] <Radditz> modify it and add it again?
[05:38:20] <aro_> yes
[05:38:26] <Radditz> thank you aro_
[05:38:30] <aro_> try it out
[05:39:44] <Radditz> I am going to try it now
[06:00:04] <Radditz> err it doesn't work
[06:00:12] <Radditz> it says myElement.attr is not a function
[06:08:03] <aro> what?
[06:08:05] <aro> Radditz:
[06:08:14] <aro> show me what you did
[06:08:15] <seutje> Radditz: you're probably running it on an HTML element instead of a jquery collection
[06:08:20] <Radditz> aro: it works now I think
[06:08:22] <seutje> $(myElement).attr()
[06:08:24] <Radditz> hm
[06:08:29] <Radditz> I did .prop
[06:08:35] <seutje> same thing
[06:08:38] <Radditz> oh ok
[06:08:42] <aro> you need to call it on a jquery collection
[06:08:47] <jop008> how to change font size of a header element?
[06:08:49] <aro> it sounds like you tried doing it on a standard DOM element
[06:08:52] <Radditz> but now I am having troubles with something else, I am not sure if I should pass
[06:09:04] <Radditz> hm
[06:09:19] <Radditz> you sait it's mutable I can modify the id and append it (without recreating)?
[06:09:26] <Radditz> cause it doesn't seem like it's being correctly added
[06:09:36] <aro> create a fiddle
[06:09:38] <seutje> got demo?
[06:09:43] <jop008> th { won't work

[06:10:05] <seutje> jop008: ^
[06:10:20] <Radditz> I think I did something wrong, it works partially probably because of a mistake in my loop
[06:10:24] <Radditz> one element is appended
[06:11:30] <seutje> usually a scoping issue when loops are involved
[06:12:40] <jop008> horrible link counting for styles
[06:17:51] <Radditz> jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/6zp7C/
[06:19:37] <Radditz> I forgot the #
[06:19:40] <Radditz> but it adds only once
[06:19:42] <Radditz> not multiple
[06:20:23] <Radditz> http://jsfiddle.net/6zp7C/1/ updated version
[06:21:53] <Radditz> If I put it inside the loop ( create it multiple times it works)
[06:22:21] <Radditz> so I am force to create it multiple times
[06:23:44] <seutje> Radditz: labelElement continues to be a reference to the same element
[06:23:53] <seutje> so it's just re-appending the element every time
[06:24:07] <Radditz> seutje: but when I append it, why does it modify it?
[06:24:29] <Radditz> seutje: I mean if I have a ="hello", b.append(a); b.append(a) ?
[06:24:52] <seutje> nah, that's a string, it generally doesn't get passed as a reference
[06:25:07] <jop008> How to change thead item above a responsive table?
[06:25:18] <jop008> Now the label is to big
[06:25:21] <Radditz> seutje: but I don't understand why it changes it, because I do append
[06:25:32] <Radditz> seutje: It appends a dom element? it's supposed to add a new one?
[06:25:34] <jop008> and with media querries I want to shrink it
[06:25:38] <aro> has anyone used masonry?
[06:25:49] <jop008> but can find out how I did inspect element
[06:25:52] <Radditz> sow what am I supposed to do? create it each time? clone it?
[06:25:56] <seutje> Radditz: you are appending the same element, but changing it before re-appending it
[06:26:09] <seutje> Radditz: create a scope in which you define the element: http://jsfiddle.net/6zp7C/4/
[06:26:14] <Radditz> seutje: if I change it's id, isn't it supposed to append it again?
[06:26:21] <seutje> no
[06:26:25] <Radditz> seutje: compared to other languages I have done I find this strange
[06:26:29] <seutje> you are changing the ID and then re-appending the same element
[06:26:38] <Radditz> say in java if I create an object and have a list, I will add it again and again
[06:26:58] <Radditz> unless I have a set and it will check the hash to know if to add it or replace it
[06:27:02] <seutje> it's like saying "I have a kid, let's call him John, I put him in this school, now I change his jacket and send him back to school"
[06:27:12] <seutje> it's the same child, same school, you only changed the jacket
[06:27:38] <seutje> the sending back to school is essentially useless
[06:27:45] <Radditz> so it's like
[06:27:48] <seutje> look: http://jsfiddle.net/6zp7C/5/
[06:27:49] <Radditz> having a pointer?
[06:28:03] <seutje> doing the append once and then changing it, changes the already appended element that's still being referenced
[06:28:11] <Radditz> why did you put a function outside it seutje ? it works witohut
[06:28:13] <seutje> reference/pointer/whatever
[06:28:30] <seutje> Radditz: what?
[06:28:33] <Radditz> is there a way to tell it to append a new value based upon the value I give?
[06:28:47] <seutje> sure, give it a new value
[06:28:47] <Radditz> seutje: you make an inline function inside the loop that is applied
[06:28:54] <seutje> or clone the one you have a reference for
[06:29:05] <seutje> Radditz: yeah, that's how I create the scope for labelElemen t
[06:29:51] <Radditz> oh
[06:30:07] <Radditz> so the idea is that because it's inside a function it will be recreated each time
[06:30:08] <seutje> js> (function(){ var lol = 'lalalla'; })(); print(typeof lol);
[06:30:11] <Radditz> but why not just put it inside the loop
[06:30:12] <b-ot> seutje: undefined
[06:30:13] <Radditz> ?
[06:30:23] <Radditz> instead of putting it inside a function
[06:30:25] <seutje> cause the loop doesn't create a scope
[06:30:32] <seutje> JS doesn't have block scope
[06:30:33] <Radditz> but it will re-create the labelElement each time
[06:30:36] <seutje> it has function scope
[06:30:39] <seutje> yeah
[06:30:44] <seutje> that's what you wanted, no?
[06:30:50] <seutje> you could also clone it
[06:30:50] <Radditz> wyhat the point of the scope then?
[06:31:02] <Radditz> I wanted to reuse it so it doesn't get parsed or whataever
[06:31:03] <seutje> not sure I follow
[06:31:04] <Radditz> each time
[06:31:13] <Radditz> if you remove the function(){ outside it
[06:31:15] <Radditz> it will work the same
[06:31:27] <seutje> the doc rdy handler?
[06:31:28] <Radditz> http://jsfiddle.net/6zp7C/6/
[06:31:36] <seutje> oh, that one
[06:32:11] <seutje> yeah, guess the function wrapper wasn't entirely necessary
[06:32:23] <seutje> xcept now it'll leak outside the loop, which might be undesired
[06:32:28] <Radditz> so I am forced to clone?
[06:32:35] <Radditz> is this the way jquery handles it or html does?
[06:32:44] <Radditz> is there a method that will append the value of tthe element?
[06:32:47] <Radditz> instead of the element?
[06:32:49] <seutje> you could also clone: http://jsfiddle.net/6zp7C/7/
[06:32:54] <Nancy2012> Hello… Is there any way to sotrt or filter by dropdown select value in datatable.. http://jsfiddle.net/575L8/1/
[06:32:59] <seutje> what do you mean by the value of an element?
[06:33:11] <seutje> I assume you don't mean the value attribute of input elements
[06:33:24] <seutje> do you mean the textContent? the innerHTML?
[06:33:25] <Radditz> I mean if I have a list of numbers say in java
[06:33:27] <Radditz> and I add a new one
[06:33:33] <jop008> tried this th.ui-table-priority-1 {     font-weight: 0.5em !important;   }
[06:33:35] <Radditz> I dont want everytime I add 5 to not do anything
[06:33:49] <jop008> but size of the header title won't change
[06:34:03] <seutje> Radditz: like an array?
[06:34:57] <seutje> js> var foo = []; for (var i = 0, len = 20; i < len; i++) { foo.push(i); } print(foo.join(', '));
[06:34:58] <seutje> like taht?
[06:35:02] <Radditz> seutje: IDK, I mean I  understand the behaviour, but since html is like text, can't it redd it after I modify
[06:35:05] <b-ot> seutje: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
[06:35:29] <seutje> Radditz: HTML is like text, but you're not dealing with HTML, you're dealing with the DOM
[06:35:50] <seutje> if you say x is that element over there and you move it, the pointer doesn't break
[06:35:51] <Radditz> so when you add a dom you still hold the reference inside the html document?
[06:35:58] <_pingu> i want to deactivate all way to open link x in a new tab. i know how to deactivate the contextmenue which appears on right mouse click. wwhich other ways are there, and how can i deactivate them?
[06:36:01] <Radditz> is there an addCopyOf?
[06:36:04] <seutje> so if you then say change x's text content and move it, the pointer remains
[06:36:17] <seutje> did u see the clone example?
[06:36:36] <seutje> can't expect all chainable methods to be concatenated into combinations of them
[06:36:52] <Skullclown> hey, I used $('.pager-item a').on('click', function() { ... }); (.pager-item are LI elements with an A tag in them), but it keeps throwing the error Object has no method 'on'
[06:36:57] <Radditz> I didnt see the clone exxample
[06:37:14] <seutje> 15:32 seutje: you could also clone: http://jsfiddle.net/6zp7C/7/
[06:37:33] <seutje> note that cloning can be more expensive in some situations
[06:37:49] <Radditz> oh ok
[06:38:15] <Radditz> I find it more readable if I can clearly see that the one on the outside is a certain way and doesn't change
[06:38:18] <Radditz> thank you seutje
[06:39:07] <ravenzz> I have a ton of <span> that I fill out with sentences after an ajax req, it seems to affect performances on IE. Initially the spans are visually hidden (visibility: hidden) on success I set the text and change the visibility to visible. Any idea on how can this be improved?
[06:39:31] <ravenzz> is there any way I can show them in bulk at least? so the style recalculation is done once?
[06:41:57] <shoky> ravenzz:  display:none instead of visiblity:hidden could improve it
[06:42:15] <shoky> or giving it an explicit width/height
[06:42:26] <ravenzz> but then they are turned into block, so there will be a style recalculation
[06:42:27] <obert> or remove it from markup!
[06:42:35] <shoky> ravenzz: sure but just one
[06:42:48] <ravenzz> just one? what do you mean?
[06:42:48] <shoky> er what do you mean turned into block?
[06:42:57] <ravenzz> they are shown
[06:43:12] <ravenzz> with either .show() or css('display', 'block')
[06:43:14] <shoky> yes, so style shit is recalculated once
[06:43:20] <ravenzz> mh
[06:43:23] <ravenzz> let me try that
[06:43:24] <shoky> display:block on a span?
[06:43:39] <ravenzz> err
[06:43:42] <ravenzz> show()
[06:43:51] <shoky> k ;p
[06:44:15] <shoky> but it'd be best to set the element's contents in one go
[06:44:28] <shoky> then it wouldn't matter much if its visiblity:hidden, i guess
[06:46:13] <ravenzz> eh unfortunately they aren't siblings
[06:46:51] <shoky> doesnt matter.. as long as you build it up detached from the DOM and then append it somewhere in one go
[06:47:31] <ravenzz> how could I append them in one go? if they belong to different containers?
[06:47:36] <aro> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20378351/use-of-masonry-with-infinite-scroll-content-creates-unstyled-flash
[06:47:46] <shoky> oh multiple containers
[06:47:59] <shoky> umm. how many containres ;s
[06:48:07] <ravenzz> a lot :(
[06:48:15] <ravenzz> it is a countries/regions list
[06:48:50] <jayayseakay> Can anyone have a quick look at http://jsfiddle.net/euug/XFALu/6/ I want it so the animation only plays once when a button is clicked etc.. can anyone shed any light on how to achieve that in jQuery??
[06:49:51] <shoky> ravenzz welp if you make a fiddle demonstrating it i can try to help, dunno
[06:52:40] <Drognan> I started working with backbone.js.  If I want to make a view for graphing latency and also have a sparkline graph you can click on to get a bigger graph, should I make 2 models and views or just one model and adjust it based on the view I want to get?
[06:55:59] <ravenzz> shoky thanks, I'll keep trying.. if I can't improve this I'll ask my cto if I can give you access to my local env. Meanwhile here is a snapshot of the IE timeline, https://www.dropbox.com/s/vu4ib38q2wenvnf/Untitled.jpg the spans I am talking about are those numbers next to the countries names
[07:01:56] <Woet> http://jsfiddle.net/4ZTfN/ - how do I change it to make it support 2 countdowns at the same tiem?

[07:04:29] <jop008> this works fine for column 1 .ui-table-priority-1 {    font-size:0.5em !important;   }
[07:04:56] <jop008> how to make it more flexible avoiding ten lines of css for a 10 column table?
[07:05:27] <Woet> jop008: im not sure how thats related to jquery?

[07:20:08] <fps> TypeError: $(...).getContext is not a function

[07:20:46] <fps> the canvas is there allright in the document with the id set
[07:21:00] <johnline> hi aro
[07:21:02] <fps> aro: that's the error i get in the firefox console
[07:21:23] <johnline> i want to block the use of it after one click
[07:21:33] <johnline> until i re-enable it with the other button
[07:21:55] <fps> hurdos: guessing: "any selectors" meaning what?
[07:23:25] <aro> johnline: hang on
[07:23:57] <johnline> hang.on() :v
[07:24:04] <hurdos> fps: e.g. I have some DOM with #id1 #id2 #id3, I need catch click from any of these selector instead of #id2.
[07:24:28] <aro> johnline: it seems to work fine to me
[07:24:44] <fps> hurdos: ah ok. http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[07:24:59] <fps> $("#id1, #id2, #id3").click()
[07:25:09] <johnline> clickonce > renabler > clickonce > renabler . nothing happens
[07:25:17] <johnline> i need this toggling to be infinite
[07:25:17] <aro> ohh
[07:25:19] <aro> hang on
[07:26:47] <fps> hmm, adapted the code a little.. http://pastebin.com/RRvu5wW9
[07:27:04] <fps> the var ctx = c.getContext("2d"); still fails..
[07:27:29] <fps> the console.log(c) results in output like this: Object[canvas#521c5bde4865de97571dc051521c7f43185cabf6540011cf]

[07:28:12] <aro> you were ont he right track
[07:28:17] <aro> does that work for you?
[07:28:50] <johnline> thanks aro, but after the first renabler
[07:28:55] <fps> aha
[07:28:57] <johnline> clickone can fire more than once
[07:29:04] <johnline> *clickonce
[07:29:08] <fps> one has to address the [0] child of the canvas element
[07:29:09] <fps> oh well
[07:30:54] <fps> aah, ok, the results is always an array.. and the other jquery functions handle that transparently (e.g. css(), etc..)
[07:33:02] <sacho_> fps, the results are actually an object usually called a jquery collection
[07:33:32] <sacho_> and yes, the methods you can call from that collection take into account that it can have multiple members.
[07:33:46] <sacho_> There are some that don't, though, e.g.

[07:48:48] <Sna4x8> Is this a decent way to queue up ajax calls so that they run in order? http://jsfiddle.net/nMfb5/
[07:49:16] <limpc> im saving a mood board by JSON.stringifying the whole div object that contains buttons and an image as well as transform properties.  Saves to file fine, but how do i reverse it and put it back on the UI?  JSON.parse gives me an object, but when I try $(myobject).appendTo('#moodboard') I get an obscure jquery error about 'e' being undefined
[07:49:16] <Sna4x8> Queuing the events up against a dummy div seems hacky..
[07:51:55] <dnsdds> I want to implement this; http://jsbin.com/azare/1/edit  -- but I really don't feel like including the massive jQ UI just for this. Is there a way to make it independent of jQ UI?

[07:54:58] <WaltherPPK> I'm using the window.resize event to trigger a function that resizes an iframe
[07:55:40] <lisamarie> Hello. I'm trying to set up a website for one of my class. I based it on the JInvertScroll script. It's basically an interactive timeline where the user has to click on icons to pop up informations. My problem is that the only places I can click to make the text bos appear is on the lower part of the icons. I removed tried a lot of things to debug it, but nothing seems to work (remove all the other elements to only keep the icons, changed the javascr
[07:55:40] <lisamarie> ipt of place, etc.) It really is bothering me!  Does anybody has a hint of what it could be? Here is the link to my page: hybrid.concordia.ca/l_sav/jInvertScroll/Final website/
[07:55:45] <limpc> shoky: ah thanks that helped me fix that issue.
[07:56:09] <WaltherPPK> Noticed that once the iframe is resized, window.resize is called once again, so I get stuck in an endless loop. How should I work around that?
[08:00:12] <shoky> WaltherPPK: not sure it's the same issue but try checking event.target on the event argument
[08:00:43] <shoky> actually donno if that makes sense. lemme check
[08:03:39] <pachet> WaltherPPK: window resize is one of those events that it's almost always better to throttle the handlers for
[08:03:48] <pachet> s/throttle/debounce or what have you
[08:08:04] <jayayseakay> Can anyone help how in JQuery I might get to the <a> tag in this http://pastebin.com/L44XbaL9
[08:09:09] <Cork> jayayseakay: $('.ui-link-inherit') ?
[08:09:19] <Cork> or what are the limitations of how to find it?
[08:10:29] <jayayseakay> Thats got it i think.. cheers
[08:12:30] <WaltherPPK> patchet: I've added a 100 ms timer that is reset on every window.resize and only fires my function once the 100 ms has passed. But it doesn't seem to help. Is there anything else I can do?
[08:13:18] <WaltherPPK> Also wondering when exactly the window.resize could fire. Which variables should I add watches for to check if any values change that could cause a window.resize?
[08:16:20] <WaltherPPK> is a changed document height or window height the only things that could cause the window.resize event to fire or could other changes also cause it?
[08:19:09] <Nomikos> WaltherPPK: width, I guess
[08:19:50] <Nomikos> WaltherPPK: and I think a script could also trigger it
[08:20:03] <WaltherPPK> sure
[08:20:43] <WaltherPPK> are there any other weird cases where other parts of the DOM (than the document and the window) could trigger a window.reisze when they are modified?
[08:20:44] <Nomikos> not sure what in/de-creasing textsize would do
[08:21:05] <WaltherPPK> good point. I'll look into that
[08:22:14] <BillCriswell> I feel dumb, just realized event is automatically defined, no reason for function(e){} or whatever.
[08:22:25] <BillCriswell> Well, not realized.. learned.
[08:22:53] <Nomikos> BillCriswell: in what context
[08:22:54] <Nomikos> ?
[08:23:07] <Nomikos> I am curious, I still use a lot of function(e) {
[08:23:35] <grafi> oô

[08:25:27] <grafi> oô
[08:25:31] <grafi> how does that work
[08:25:32] <grafi> ...
[08:26:22] <BillCriswell> I don't know. Some wizard in ##javascript mentioned it... I didn't believe him at first.
[08:26:37] <Nomikos> BillCriswell: if I do $('body').on('click', function(){ console.log(event); }); I get "ReferenceError: event is not defined"
[08:26:41] <grafi> i mean is that jquery magic?
[08:26:43] <Nomikos> after clicking in the body, obv
[08:26:44] <grafi> or what
[08:27:21] <Nomikos> if event was defined in  a parent scope it might work, but maybe not do what you intended
[08:28:54] <grafi> if
[08:29:03] <grafi> i have never ever ever seen any var event xD
[08:29:12] <BillCriswell> Nomikos: I tried it on an <a> element.

[08:30:38] <sodapoppin> with HTML5, are you able to query a directory on the same server the web app is running using jquery, to list all the files in a dir, even a dir that the web app is not in?

[08:31:07] <BillCriswell> grafi: Which browser?
[08:31:10] <grafi> ff
[08:31:15] <Nomikos> sodapoppin: you'll need a serverside language, like php, but then yes, that'd be easy

[08:35:58] <sodapoppin> thanks guys
[08:36:31] <BillCriswell> Nomikos: I think that's just jsbin. When I load it up sometimes it just seems to give like.. a blank stare or something, a refresh adjusts it usually.

[09:22:48] <Velveeta> rethus: are you getting any errors in your console?
[09:23:03] <Velveeta> kegster: possibly the gutter for the scrollbar?
[09:23:40] <glambert> is there a way of finding elements containing text without getting their parents too?
[09:23:43] <rethus> Velveeta so errors
[09:24:12] <glambert> $(document.body).find(":contains('hello world')"); is returning table cells and spans etc. but also their parent elements
[09:24:23] <rethus> console log give out my string, but the event is not fired

[09:25:43] <nafta> how are you BillCriswell and Velveeta?
[09:25:46] <nafta> long time :D
[09:25:53] <Velveeta> awright awright awright
[09:26:12] <BillCriswell> Living the dream.
[09:26:17] <Velveeta> nafta: post data can be modified before transmission to the server as well, it's just not as easy
[09:26:26] <Velveeta> that's why you always sanitize your inputs, never just trust data from the client
[09:26:29] <nafta> but is it harder?
[09:26:36] <Velveeta> http://xkcd.com/327/
[09:26:45] <BillCriswell> I bet that's bobby drop tables.
[09:26:46] <koneko> nafta, that's all the same, you can send a POST request with a simple Chrome addon
[09:26:53] <Velveeta> that's little bobby tables alright ;)

[09:29:08] <nafta> Velveeta http://jsfiddle.net/52Ucm/
[09:29:13] <koneko> nafta, you need to sanitize it server-side. If it's PHP and the data is for a SQL query you probably need to use mysql_real_escape_string or the likes.
[09:29:36] <BillCriswell> PDO!

[09:33:07] <rethus> http://counter.troteclive.de/
[09:33:55] <rethus> have i to add a wait ?
[09:34:05] <kegster> Velveeta, interesting concept.
[09:34:24] <Velveeta> nafta: when you say you're getting hacked by that string, what exactly is happening?
[09:35:35] <Velveeta> kegster: if you use a method like that, make sure you just execute it once, at load time or something, and cache that value, rather than calculating it on the fly each time you want to muck with scrollbar width/height ;)
[09:36:08] <fabioportieri> anyone?
[09:36:20] <rethus> shoky didnt work
[09:36:30] <koneko> nafta, do you mean the sessName variable capturing someone's session? Anyway, it's probably a PHP question, not a jQuery question.
[09:37:13] <nafta> Velveeta I'm getting points on my database directly to the php script...but I guess koneko is right...this is more a php question
[09:38:01] <koneko> nafta, you need to authenticate better in PHP, jQuery won't help you with this
[09:38:22] <koneko> Anyway, that's what I would advise - do it server-side
[09:38:24] <Velveeta> fabioportieri: firefox supports transitions doesn't it?
[09:38:47] <fabioportieri> Velveeta: not background transition, am i right?
[09:39:08] <Velveeta> i'm not sure, what are you actually transitioning?
[09:39:18] <rethus> shoky it doesnt switch
[09:39:32] <fabioportieri> it works on chrome not on firefox
[09:39:49] <fabioportieri> but that function returns true in firefox too
[09:39:53] <fabioportieri> Velveeta: a background image
[09:41:52] <Velveeta> let me check my firefox
[09:43:28] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/6mW6YvZy
[09:43:32] <rethus> have this now
[09:43:35] <Velveeta> fabioportier: but 'transition' itself is a supported property
[09:43:41] <rethus> not working.
[09:43:48] <Velveeta> whether a background transition is supported or not is a separate issue
[09:44:32] <fabioportieri> Velveeta: i guess so.. any idea how to check for background transition, if i can..?
[09:44:43] <Velveeta> that i'm not sure of
[09:45:04] <fabioportieri> i do background transition like that  '-webkit-transition': 'background-image 0.2s ease-in-out', '-moz-transition': 'background-image 0.2s ease-in-out',  etc etc
[09:45:06] <kegster> Velveeta, well i want it to adjust on browser size change. did pretty well with an all css responsive site, but i have a few fancy tables and features that ive made pretty darn responsiove as well, but want to patch it up with some JS to make it more smooth for JS enabled devices
[09:45:16] <kegster> so im listening for window change as well ;)
[09:46:01] <rethus> shoky please can you give me a hint?http://pastebin.com/6mW6YvZy
[09:47:20] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: You ever use the "Map To Network Resource" option in chrome?
[09:47:21] <Velveeta> fabioportieri: looks like firefox will support it with :before and :after pseudo-elements: http://jsfiddle.net/BXLkx/
[09:47:37] <Velveeta> billcriswell: what voodoo sorcery is this of which you speak?
[09:48:40] <Velveeta> kegster: but the scrollbar width/height aren't going to change based on the browser window, unless you talking about whether they appear at all or not based on the size of the window
[09:48:51] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: You can edit a CSS file locally and have it injected to a live site basically... It's great when it works but sometimes it just stops working and I can't tell why.
[09:49:23] <rethus> anybody has an idea?
[09:49:59] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what I just did... but it fixed it. My least favorite kind of fixes haha.
[09:50:09] <Velveeta> rethus: what's the question?
[09:50:47] <Velveeta> billcriswell: there's a guy here that gave us a presentation on this long, convoluted setup of livereload for chrome, so that when he saves an asset file on disk, it autoreloads his browser
[09:50:58] <Velveeta> i was like "so you went through all that just to save yourself 1 keystroke?"
[09:51:18] <rethus> Velveeta http://pastebin.com/6mW6YvZy
[09:51:44] <Velveeta> rethus: that's not a question
[09:51:51] <rethus> each label should be clicked after 3500 ms
[09:52:04] <BillCriswell> Does live reload inject the style changes or does it need to reload the whole page?
[09:52:14] <rethus> http://counter.troteclive.de/ this is the page
[09:52:40] <Velveeta> oh, well, you're not clicking the label in that code example, you're finding the element it's bound to, and setting its checked property to true
[09:53:09] <Velveeta> billcriswell: it physically reloads the whole page
[09:53:18] <kegster> Velveeta, ahh, cache the scroll width duh my bad ha
[09:53:24] <Velveeta> i was like "dude, that's a split-second cntl/cmd-r"
[09:53:24] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Blah.
[09:54:01] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha when it's on a dev server with caching disabled it can be a pretty big difference.. at least in my experience.
[09:54:42] <Velveeta> rethus: you're triggering that setTimeout once as opposed to intermittently
[09:54:49] <Velveeta> i'll make a fiddle for you
[09:54:50] <BillCriswell> Of course I also have to save > upload > refresh, with this way I just have to save which is really nice ( when it's working )
[09:56:06] <BillCriswell> Ideally I'd like ot work locally all the time haha
[10:01:28] <aro> anyone familiar with masonry?
[10:02:27] <BillCriswell> aro: I have some friends who went to school for it!
[10:03:49] <aro> very funny
[10:14:46] <Velveeta> rethus: if you're still here, here's an example of something like you'll need: http://jsfiddle.net/RH83j/5/
[10:23:38] <Velveeta> i'm stupid, not that one, this one: http://jsfiddle.net/RH83j/12/
[10:35:35] <Drognan> This is working "this.attributes.network.attributes.networkid" but I'm pretty sure it's the wrong way to do it.  Any tips?
[10:40:35] <Ziberius> hello
[10:41:02] <Ziberius> not sure if it's off topic but does anyone know what version of IE is used for compatibility view on IE11?
[10:42:56] <snover> Ziberius: it is always an inaccurate emulation of ie7
[10:43:21] <Ziberius> inaccurate? lol
[10:43:25] <Ziberius> thanx for the info
[10:46:42] <rainabba> I have a function that simple returns $('#selUseWebService :selected').val() but that call from my app is throwing a 'DOMException' from jQuery-1.9.1.min.js even though in console, the exact same code returns false as I'd expect. What's going on?
[10:48:13] <rainabba> I'm stumped on such an apparently simple issue :P
[10:48:50] <Ziberius> rainabba, I think you should use $('#selUseWebService selected').val()
[10:50:56] <Ziberius> rainabba, sorry it's  $('#selUseWebService option:selected').val()
[10:51:03] <rainabba> Ziberius: I'm pretty sure that syntax isn't valid and mine is fine. Mine even returns false as I expect after I resume the debugger. I just can't figure out why I'm getting the DOMException.
[10:51:15] <rainabba> I'll try that one :)
[10:51:17] <Ziberius> it's the latter sorry
[10:51:19] <Ziberius> :-)
[10:51:57] <Velveeta> :selected should be valid by itself also, i believe
[10:51:59] <rainabba> Ziberius: Same thing. I get a valid response after I resume past the DOMException but don't see why i get the exception in the meantime.
[10:52:20] <Velveeta> rainabba: are there any details with the domexception?
[10:54:11] <rainabba> Velveeta: https://plus.google.com/116853723811027299597/posts/SRy2KGoWGv3
[10:54:25] <rainabba> Call stack and Locals
[10:56:01] <Velveeta> what happens if you console.log($('#selUseWebService').length) ?
[10:57:06] <rainabba> Returns 1 without the exception
[10:58:08] <rainabba> console.log($('#selUseWebService :selected')) throws the DOMException again
[10:58:31] <rainabba> console.log($('#selUseWebService')) does NOT throw any exceptions
[10:58:32] <Velveeta> what if you change that to $('#selUseWebService').find(':selected') ?
[10:58:48] <rainabba> DOMException again
[10:59:10] <rainabba> This is Chrome 33 btw
[10:59:20] <Velveeta> how about if you do ('[selected="selected"]') instead of :selected ?
[10:59:43] <Velveeta> let me take a look at the src real quick to see what it does for the :selected pseudo-selector
[11:01:24] <rainabba> Velveeta: Thank you. All the variations I try with that approach just return an empty array. My syntax is fine right? I wouldn't expect empty array. $('#selUseWebService[selected="selected"]')
[11:01:42] <Velveeta> you need a space between selUseWebService and [selected
[11:01:59] <rainabba> $('#selUseWebService [selected="selected"]')
[11:02:01] <Velveeta> right
[11:02:04] <rainabba> Still returns an empty array
[11:02:25] <rainabba> Shouldn't that either return the element or undefined?
[11:02:58] <Velveeta> it should return a jquery collection of matching elements… if there are no matching elements, it should return an empty collection
[11:03:06] <rainabba> ahh
[11:03:07] <Velveeta> which is technically [], but with extra properties on it
[11:03:19] <rainabba> Only getting []
[11:03:20] <Velveeta> so, let me ask you this, i'm assuming selUseWebService is a wrapper
[11:03:27] <Velveeta> around some selectable options
[11:03:36] <Velveeta> what's your markup actually look like?
[11:04:04] <rainabba> <select id="selUseWebService" name="selUseWebService"><option value="true">Use Web Service When Possible</option><option value="false" selected="true">Always Open in Browser</option></select>
[11:04:06] <Guest34729> got a question what do i need to do to get jquery to connect to a postgres database?
[11:04:35] <rainabba> Guest12834: Expose it via a webservice and use something like an $.ajax() call to pull JSON
[11:04:50] <Velveeta> guest34729: jquery can't connect to a postgres db directly, it needs to run through another layer like rainabba said
[11:05:28] <Guest34729> can you you please be more specific or anybody know a link that discusses the topic?
[11:05:30] <Velveeta> rainabba: what happens if you console.log this: $('#selUseWebService')[0].selectedIndex
[11:05:58] <Velveeta> guest34729: the db is going to be on the back end server, whatever is handling your requests (php, .net, RoR, whatever) is what connects to the db
[11:06:02] <rainabba> Guest12834: Google "JSON Web Services" and prepare for a lot of learning. It's not exactly a simple/fast task.
[11:06:08] <Velveeta> jquery itself just makes a request to that php, .net, whatever back end
[11:06:20] <rainabba> Velveeta: Returns 1
[11:06:24] <rainabba> No exception :)
[11:06:32] <Guest34729> thanx :)
[11:06:51] <rainabba> Velveeta: Changes to 0 with the select as expected
[11:06:56] <aro> is there a way to insert a jquery object into a page and then reference it somehow to add a class to it?
[11:07:04] <aro> instead of adding the class to the object and THEN inserting it?
[11:07:16] <Velveeta> rainabba: how about this, let's try low-tech :D var selUseWebService = $('#selUseWebService')[0]; console.log(selUseWebService.options[selUseWebService.selectedIndex]);
[11:07:33] <rainabba> aro: A jQuery object is just a JS object and not an element with the class attribute as I think you're imagining.
[11:07:48] <Velveeta> aro: sure, just cache it off to a variable, insert it, then add the class to the variable instance
[11:08:11] <Velveeta> var myEl = $('<div>sdf</div>'); $('body').append(myEl); myEl.addClass('foo');
[11:08:34] <Velveeta> you could also do it in one line like this: $('<div>sdf</div>').appendTo('body').addClass('foo');
[11:08:47] <rainabba> Velveeta: That returns the selected OPTION element (thank you) which will get me going but I'm still curious why my simple selector is throwing an Exception because that will likely cause me problems elsewhere.
[11:09:03] <rainabba> aro: Sorry if I got that wrong :)
[11:09:08] <Velveeta> i have no clue what's going on w/ the standard selector syntax
[11:09:48] <Velveeta> if you wrap that (crashing) selector in a try / catch, can you get any textual error message besides just DOMException?
[11:10:00] <Velveeta> like maybe "DOMException: element doesn't exist" or anything like that?
[11:11:27] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[11:13:36] <rainabba> Velveeta: I'll try that but I do get a return value after the DOMException. If you want to try something REAL interesting, goto jquery.com, edit the page and add my select from above, then in the console, try the same select and see if you get the DOMException. I thought maybe it was an issue with 1.9.1 so I figured I'd try on jquery.com (which is likely running something way newer and maybe
[11:13:36] <rainabba> not even released) and got the EXACT same exception.
[11:14:22] <Bloomberg> I have problems with this  ::::   .scrollabletab()
[11:14:35] <Guest34729> Velveeta, forgive me but am I understanding this right jquery itself just makes a request to that php, .net, whatever back end. It does this automatically? I thought I have to make a call to whatever is handling the request
[11:14:41] <Bloomberg> Until here works ok  :::: $('#tabs').tabs()
[11:14:48] <motaka2> can anyone explain this code to me? http://codepaste.net/6xgk4z
[11:14:52] <Bloomberg> But If I put this  ::::   $('#tabs').tabs().scrollabletab();
[11:14:58] <Bloomberg> doesn't works
[11:15:36] <Velveeta> guest34729: that is what's handling the request… let's say you have a php page, edit_user.php… that php script then calls out to the db to get the user data that's being edited, perform updates, whatever.. from jquery, you call to that php script, you don't call to the database itself, php does that
[11:15:39] <rainabba> Velveeta: Stranger still... try { $('#selUseWebService :selected') } catch(foo) { console.log("error: %o", foo); debugger; }
[11:15:57] <rainabba> That gives me the exception instead of hitting the catch.
[11:16:42] <Guest34729> Ah-ha! that clears the confusion, I'm new to jquery but I love it it's pretty robust.
[11:17:00] <Velveeta> it definitely is, that's why i've stuck w/ it so long ;)
[11:21:16] <Guest34729> got another question, I've built a website with jquery and the page will mirror itself example: tabs and login -username: password on top, then the username, and password on the bottom of the page I've looked and don't see any extra <div> tags? got any ideas?
[11:21:45] <rainabba> Guest12834: jQuery is just a JavaScript library to simplify common and complex client operations. It cannot do anything your browser is not capable of (like talking to a DB). Databases are made accessible by servers and a browser can only access a DB via a web-server (usually using web-services that provide JSON data these days).
[11:22:01] <ReBa1> Has anyone had this "max-height" problem too? I've got a div that has a height of 1000px, and I set my max-height via $('.selector').first().css('max-height', 273); -> all browsers accept it, except for Safari...
[11:22:15] <rainabba> Guest12834: Ever used jsFiddle?
[11:22:24] <Guest34729> no
[11:22:56] <Alina-malina> I am thinking to use .json files as database alternative for mysql, tell me is it good and how safe it will be to use it?
[11:23:01] <rainabba> Guest12834: If not, check it out. it's a common way to ask JS/HTML/CSS related questions and quite often, by the time you create an example of your issue there, you'll have found the problem and if not, you can share the code with a URL that we can check out.
[11:23:34] <Guest34729> thanx rainabba :)
[11:24:24] <rainabba> Alina-malina: JSON is not an alternative to a DB really. Is your data completely static or at least only ever changed by you (one person at a time)? If so, then you could do that though it might/might-not be a good idea for any number of reasons. If more than one person needs to change that data, it will not work.
[11:25:00] <rainabba> If you need a "lighter" solution that MySQL, you might check out SQLite
[11:25:04] <Alina-malina> rainabba, it is a blog, i add stuff, but people ar egoing to leave comments as well and those also will be in json format
[11:25:20] <ReBa1> Alina-malina: You can pass your data from server to your client via json or from the client to the server, but you can't do anything specific with your database when on client-side.
[11:25:56] <rainabba> Alina-malina: Then you can't use a JSON flat file realistically because of locking issues. JSON is just a format and can be stored many ways, but you'll need some DB on the back-end (like SQLIte, MySql, etc..)
[11:26:38] <Alina-malina> rainabba, i mean i want to store them like .json format, withut database, is it going to work more faster?
[11:27:04] <Alina-malina> i want to make that website like static
[11:27:08] <rainabba> Velveeta: I'm starting to suspect some strangeness in my browser. Would you be willing to drop that SELECT in another page with jQuery then try the selector and see if you get the DOMException? I'm going to try a jsFiddle right now as a final check.
[11:27:57] <rainabba> Alina-malina: That's not a static site though if your readers can do anything to modify it (like leaving comments). If you just want a blog, why not use a common blog solution like Blogger?
[11:28:14] <Alina-malina> rainabba, i hate blogger
[11:28:15] <Velveeta> rainabba: i've used that kind of selector before with no problems
[11:28:18] <Alina-malina> i want to make something special
[11:28:26] <Velveeta> that's why i was saying it seems like a perfectly valid selector
[11:28:38] <Alina-malina> if clients send the comments with ajax and the processor like php store them in json format, will that work?
[11:28:49] <rainabba> Alina-malina: How would you do it?
[11:28:50] <Alina-malina> and save those files
[11:28:59] <Alina-malina> with php
[11:29:04] <rainabba> Alina-malina: If you can't answer that question, then no, it won't work because you can't code it :)
[11:29:18] <Alina-malina> why it wont work?
[11:29:25] <rainabba> Alina-malina: If you can't answer that question, then no, it won't work because you can't code it :)
[11:29:32] <rainabba> Alina-malina: How would you do it?
[11:29:41] <rainabba> YOU being the key there
[11:29:45] <Alina-malina> open write and close
[11:29:50] <Alina-malina> how else it is possible?
[11:29:51] <Alina-malina> loool
[11:29:55] <rainabba> If you can imagine how to do it, then it's possible
[11:30:09] <rainabba> We can't answer that for you
[11:30:16] <Alina-malina> will it work or not?
[11:30:55] <rainabba> Alina-malina: Go try and find out
[11:31:04] <rainabba> If you can't imagine how to do it, then YOU can make it work.
[11:31:05] <Alina-malina> php cant handle writing files in json format and closing them?
[11:31:19] <rainabba> s/can't/can
[11:32:34] <rainabba> i've been coding 15+ years and i wouldn't try it that way. You'd have to write some nasty scripts to scan folders for files to load data. By the time you get all that done, you've done a lot more than would be required to store the EXACT same data in a DB. That's what they're for :)
[11:33:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: bro you there
[11:33:17] <rainabba> Of course, in my experience, PHP developers are usually either inexperienced developers or like doing such nasty things :P
[11:33:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: couldnt agree more
[11:33:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: esp. when they try their hand on front end
[11:33:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> ooohhh does it get messy
[11:34:08] * rainabba is trying to spin up with Node.js, Yoeman, Grunt, NPM, etc.. but doing so on Windows is proving a bit tricky.
[11:34:11] <Alina-malina> rainabba, heh philosopy looool
[11:35:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: thats why they call it a challenge
[11:35:55] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: Those developer generally don't know the difference between client/server, developer/designer, compiled/interpreted, etc... I can't imagine becoming a developer these days. I got to spin up slowly from the days of gwbasic on DOS 3 and wasn't in a rush to produce a live web application :)  I was content trying to tweak Gorillas to see if I could do it without breaking the game
[11:35:55] <rainabba> and maybe even getting results I expected :)
[11:36:43] <Velveeta> who knew bananas could be so explosive?
[11:36:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: its a learning process you need to quickly adapt.. in our day and age backend and front end is the same now
[11:36:47] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: That's putting it lightly really. NPM seems to want node-gyp which in turn wants to do some compiling using vcbuild.exe (or such) and NOTHING is documented so I'm SOL at the moment.
[11:37:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:37:26] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: I disagree strongly there but then I build some fairly hefty apps where I can have a proper designer doing one thing, a DBA doing another, then multiple developers in the middle.
[11:37:46] <rainabba> Clearly understanding the different roles is key even if you're doing them all yourself.
[11:38:12] * rainabba realises that he's both a project manager, dba, developer and designer most of the time
[11:38:23] <rainabba> No wonder I always have headaches :P
[11:38:47] <rainabba> Time to go figure out why my extremely simple code is blowing up :(
[11:39:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: you sohuld split that work amoungst 2 atleast
[11:39:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> 1 to ocncentrate on backend
[11:39:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> one on front end
[11:39:19] <Velveeta> another way to split it is like this:
[11:39:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> i mean I do all those but i fond it hard
[11:39:31] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: Looking for work and in the US (more or less)?
[11:39:36] <Velveeta> 1 to do all the work, 1 to collect the paycheck for the project and dish out a portion of it to the codemonkey
[11:39:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol Velveeta
[11:39:52] <rainabba> Velveeta: Exactly! I get to do both though.
[11:39:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: well
[11:40:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> over what epriod of time
[11:40:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> *period
[11:40:07] <rainabba> Finding good help is as hard as my code most of the time.
[11:40:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> *period
[11:40:34] <Velveeta> yeah, we hire probably 1 out of every 15 or 20 people we interview for a job here
[11:40:44] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: This project is in year 7 right now and I don't see an end at the rate we're growing. I'm an ass to work for though (former Marine)
[11:40:45] <Velveeta> and only about 1 in 5-10 even make it to the point of an interview
[11:40:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol Velveeta i think i beter that rate in #jquery
[11:41:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: a bit of discipline with a guys foot up my ass (figuritively) is nothing new
[11:41:34] <rainabba> Hehe
[11:41:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> how long would you need me for
[11:41:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> its part time right?
[11:43:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol ive been listening to epic sax guy for 4 hours straight 6 more hours left in vid
[11:43:23] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: Couldn't say until much more conversation was had. I prefer to do peice-meal (project) work so it's neither full/part-time. Depends on how much you agree to do at any moment and how long it takes you. If you're serious, link me to a resume with your email on it and I'll check it out.
[11:43:52] <ReBa1> http://jsfiddle.net/Wd9wE/ This menu works in Firefox, IE10 & Chrome (I tested the fiddle in FF and it worked, chrome didn't work right...). How could it be that it doesn't work in safari at all?
[11:43:54] <Velveeta> i have a better idea
[11:44:04] <Velveeta> how about you just come work for us, rainabba
[11:44:17] <Velveeta> you could be our next 1 in 15 or 20
[11:44:20] <rainabba> I REALLY doubt you could afford me :)
[11:44:52] <Velveeta> i don't know, i'm pretty comfortable :D
[11:45:05] <Velveeta> although i have a pretty comfortable job title too
[11:45:05] <rainabba> Velveeta: I've considered it a few times but for what most people want to pay, I think I'd have to join some friends at Google before I'd be willing to take a JOB.
[11:45:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay. That last part might be an issue, im developing my portfolio right now, thats why I am showing interest in your job. Although I have dribbble stuff and 1-2 web projects i can show you the front end for.
[11:45:39] <Velveeta> i used to say i was gonna be with my current company until google was ready to scoop me up, but then i heard they work their devs like slaves, and that dream was slightly dashed
[11:45:50] <Velveeta> i still sometimes feel like it might be worth it just for the learning experience
[11:46:00] <Velveeta> and they have such fun projects like polymer going on
[11:46:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: I have better thigns about google
[11:46:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> you should check their job postings
[11:46:25] <Velveeta> i've checked their job postings
[11:46:30] <Velveeta> i'm not ready to market myself to them yet
[11:46:32] <rainabba> Velveeta: I wouldn't be a dev, I'd be a Dev Advocate (same thing Paul Irish does now) which is basically their title for "Project Manager who actually knows their shit"
[11:46:36] <Velveeta> i'm still developing my own brand ;)
[11:46:52] <Velveeta> rainabba: that's what i'm talkin about, i aspire to irish's position
[11:47:04] <Velveeta> or programmer evangelist
[11:47:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol rainabba
[11:47:22] <Velveeta> just being able to advocate for the devs, and play with bleeding edge tech to be able to speak for it
[11:47:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> love Paul Irish
[11:47:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> best guy ever.....I really want to get #jquery conference tickets and hear him speak
[11:47:59] <Velveeta> i got to speak at a jquery conference here a couple months ago
[11:48:04] <Velveeta> but sadly he wasn't there
[11:48:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> damn
[11:48:19] <Velveeta> got to meet alex sexton briefly, but he didn't speak
[11:48:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya toronto, canada got him in 2013
[11:48:41] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: He speaks at Google I/O as well and recently, the Chrome Dev Summit (both of which are available on YouTube now).
[11:48:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: just for curiousity purposes where are you located
[11:48:58] <rainabba> Chandler, AZ (Suberb of Phoenix)
[11:48:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: one of my programming idols
[11:49:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: okay, nvm
[11:49:45] <Velveeta> i watched him on #perfmatters a month or 2 back
[11:49:52] <Velveeta> along w/ a trio of other brainiacs
[11:49:58] <Velveeta> that was roughly 4 hours of awesome
[11:50:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:51:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: so to show my dirbbble files: http://dribbble.com/rohanbhangui
[11:51:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> also some sites you can check out i coed a while back
[11:51:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://gethighered.ca/
[11:52:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: also I have somethign I just finished
[11:52:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://higher.comuv.com/
[11:52:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> backend was hooked by someone else
[11:52:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> its not much but I have a real knack for it
[11:53:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> the last link was bound for touch devices
[11:54:35] <tubiz> pls what is the best way tolearn jquery
[11:55:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> tubiz: by trial and error and setting small self proejcts and asking any difficulties right here
[11:55:20] <rainabba> Dribble ... :) Thought that was a metaphor
[11:55:37] <tubiz> Rohan_Bhangui but i dont know js
[11:56:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> tubiz: its a good skill to have to know js to learn jquery, but its not essential at the moment
[11:56:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i learned jquery before learning pure js
[11:56:32] <tubiz> ok
[11:56:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> tubiz: start here i suggest: http://learn.jquery.com/
[11:56:39] <tubiz> ok
[11:57:24] <tubiz> thanks
[11:57:43] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: Liking the design for higher.comuv.com.
[11:57:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya it wasnt something I liked though
[11:58:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> directv approved it so I didnt try to question
[11:58:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> i prefer flat design, there is a purtiy to it
[11:58:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> *purity
[11:59:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: i have a front end just add water framework in the works right now which is meant for rapid flat design prototyping --> http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[11:59:28] <obert> pff
[12:01:35] <Aquaword> hi
[12:02:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Aquaword: hi
[12:02:02] <Aquaword> is it possible to get the DIV where my cursor is staying currently?
[12:02:13] <Aquaword> div name, class
[12:02:47] <Aquaword> i dont want a hover effect to run if the cursor is in a specific DIV element
[12:03:09] <aquaone> a word, eh?
[12:03:38] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: There a reason you're loading 3 different jQuery libraries at higher.comuv.com?
[12:04:03] <Velveeta> in…. case……… he wants to use jquery more than once?
[12:04:09] <rainabba> Velveeta: Something is VERY wrong here because I'm getting those DOMExceptions on other pages now.
[12:04:12] <sparr> I want my user to click a button, that to trigger an AJAX request, and the results of that request to appear in a dialog box. I'm using jQuery right now, and can also use jqueryui if necessary. How would I do this?
[12:04:16] <rainabba> Velveeta: Lol
[12:04:38] <Velveeta> `api ajax @ sparr
[12:04:38] <b-ot> sparr: No matches.
[12:04:42] <Velveeta> wtf b-ot
[12:04:53] <Velveeta> sparr: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:04:55] <sparr> bot error messages should go to the requester, not the @
[12:06:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: we hand a local one running for local devlopment
[12:06:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> forgot to remove
[12:06:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> the other one is amigrate plugin if im not mistaken
[12:08:34] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: Should check something like if ($) { //Don't load jQuery } instead of loading 3 times.
[12:08:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[12:08:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have to do some eprformance stuff for it
[12:09:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> its ongoing actually
[12:09:16] <rainabba> Might be something funny on my side too :)
[12:12:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> dw, try it on a mobile device
[12:12:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> see the issue is
[12:13:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> browsers on mobile the adress bar and stuff take alot of realestate, with that in mind, we can compressed the design to accommodate the adress bar
[12:13:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: it was built with iphone and ipad in mind
[12:14:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: so i know its not alot to go on, but what you think
[12:14:39] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: Now I can't hire you :P
[12:15:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol, figured
[12:15:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i guess im apart of those 19/20 people right? :P
[12:16:06] <Velveeta> we set a pretty high bar, it takes a lot just to even make it to an in-person interview :D
[12:16:28] <sparr> http://jsfiddle.net/sparr/78XQb/ I would like to write a userscript that modifies the behavior of this fiddle, such that when your ip is displayed the string is modified in some way first. How would I go about accomplishing that?
[12:16:50] <kpl> I have a table where one tr has class="even row_selected". In Firebug, if I click tr, in the right panel "style" tab I can see the background-color for style tr.even, but how do I see the css of class row_selected?
[12:17:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: my main issue I have nothing to show
[12:17:13] <Velveeta> sparr: which string is modified? the IP?
[12:17:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> and people giving me a shot despite that is rare
[12:17:38] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: we're not quite so concerned with a lack of portfolio, but we grill em on a wide variety of technical stuff
[12:17:56] <sparr> Velveeta: yes. say instead of (data.ip) I want to output ("Your ip:" + data.ip)
[12:18:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i figure that I would fail your interview :P
[12:18:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> I guess Richard is the man when it comes to interview, eh?
[12:18:35] <Velveeta> sparr: http://jsfiddle.net/78XQb/1/
[12:18:42] <sparr> kpl: you should also see other classes that apply to the element below the tr.even in the style tab
[12:18:47] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: i'm one of em, yep :)
[12:19:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> ( i helped you out with something a while back thats why I know your name, a slider if I recall)
[12:19:06] <Velveeta> we encourage all of our front end engineers to get into the rotation for phone screens
[12:19:11] <sparr> Velveeta: sorry, I was unclear. I do not want to modify the existing script's code. I want to write a userscript that modifies its behavior.
[12:19:26] <Velveeta> what was that mean: "a userscript" ?
[12:19:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: device sizes are important
[12:19:49] <sparr> Velveeta: a script run by the browser/agent, separate from and in addition to the scripts provided by the site
[12:20:04] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: we don't ask about any specific device sizes, we ask a lot of fundamentals, things to be considered for various types of tasks, etc
[12:20:08] <sparr> Velveeta: http://userscripts.org has many examples. bookmarklets are also a kind of userscript
[12:20:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: interesting, id still fail
[12:21:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> im an ass when it comes to adopting things, but once I embrace something, oho do I fucking embrace it, I give it a squeezing hug
[12:23:26] <kpl> sparr: The only background-color I see in the style tab is tr.even{  }
[12:24:26] <sparr> kpl: firebug occasionally misses things, sadly. that's one reason I moved to chrome for that sort of ui debugging
[12:26:48] <kpl> sparr: But then there is a hyperlink to the css file containing that background-color, and if I click that I get that css file in the left panel. Now if I search for row_selected I do find table.display tr.even.row_selected td {}, but how do I know that this is the one currently applied? I mean, it could be overridden, right?
[12:27:42] <sparr> kpl: it could be. firebug misses overrides, or mis-prioritizes them, sometimes
[12:31:26] <rethus> hi, If i run this script, the 6 slides are run directly till the last, no delay. http://jsfiddle.net/Dba5B/1/
[12:31:28] <rethus> why
[12:32:08] <Velveeta> rethus: i answered this question for you a couple of hours ago, but you disappeared
[12:32:50] <rethus> yes, sorry. My company was closed, and the boss throw me out. Now i'm at home
[12:32:51] <rainabba> Bad jQuery! http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11478 Cost me HOURS of head-scratching and all they have to say is: "Sometimes we do operations that throw exceptions, and it's unavoidable. As long as we catch them it shouldn't be a problem."
[12:33:15] <rethus> did you have it into the history of this irc and could past it again please
[12:33:25] <Velveeta> rethus: http://jsfiddle.net/RH83j/12/
[12:33:39] <Velveeta> that's example code to model your own code after
[12:33:40] <kpl> sparr: So it is supposed to show the values of the currently applied styles, and in which file and line they are defined?
[12:33:44] <rethus> Thanks a lot, I'll have a look
[12:34:04] <sparr> kpl: yes, and it does that *almost* all the time
[12:34:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> rainabba: so for the fact I dont have much of a portfolio you didn't pick me right (im trying to get contructive critisism)
[12:35:47] <rainabba> Rohan_Bhangui: Honestly, not a portfolio, but resume. Your comment about iStuff doesn't help. Get me a proper resume and I will look at it.
[12:36:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> alright, I hve to update
[12:36:11] <rainabba> List of skills, time with them, previous work, education, etc...
[12:36:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> havent applied to formal job in  a while
[12:36:33] <rainabba> I'll PM you a link to mine so you have an idea of the type of info I'd be looking for.
[12:36:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[12:36:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> do you have an email I can send it to (for privacy sake and should you not be online)
[12:39:45] <relipse> it seems I want to do this: var a = b = 'foobar'; but b refers to the global b, is it possible to specify b as a local variable all in one statement like that?
[12:47:33] <kpl> For a css like "tr.even.row_selected td" it means td descending from a tr with BOTH class even AND row_selected, right?
[12:48:21] <Velveeta> kpl: yes
[12:48:45] <Velveeta> relipse: maybe something like: var b, a = b = 'foobar';
[12:48:55] <Velveeta> that's awfully ugly though, just to save a line
[12:49:49] <relipse> then a would be global
[12:49:54] <relipse> right?
[12:49:56] <relipse> or wait no
[12:50:06] <relipse> lol i was just wondering, in the mean time i've resorted to 2 lines
[12:51:02] <Velveeta> nope, a should be local in that case also, it just reads weird :D
[12:52:22] <MarchHare> Anybody what did I do wrong:

[12:54:04] <guymandude> ERROR:  relation "webtest" does not exist
[12:55:14] <Velveeta> uh… this is #jquery...
[12:55:44] <guymandude> sorry, thanx got confused brains on overtime
[12:56:19] <Guest53835> amm. people.  this is not valid syntax? $(this).parents('tr').first().remove();
[12:56:44] <Guest53835> want to delete a table row TR from dom
[12:57:06] <Velveeta> yes, that looks valid
[13:03:42] <Guest53835> Velveeta,  I have that table row in side a jquery ui dialog box. it seems i cant even delete it by id. why so?
[13:04:11] <Velveeta> the only thing i can think is that it may be loaded in an iframe inside that dialog
[13:04:23] <Velveeta> can you put up a jsfiddle example or a link to see it live?
[13:09:36] <Guest53835> Velveeta, hm
[13:27:16] <brombomb> I'm trying to select all li's inside a ul, that have the property 'selected="selected"'
[13:27:54] <brombomb> I know li's aren't supposed to have a selected property but the code owners don't... any ideas?
[13:30:42] <sparr> brombomb: when you say "aren't supposed to have", you mean "don't have".
[13:31:53] <sparr> brombomb: you/they can't make up new properties. officially, there's no DOM-y way to detect that "property". the only approach I might suggest is to parse the innerHTML of the ul, but that's a horrible approach.
[13:31:54] <Guest53835> Velveeta,  iam getting "undefined" for $("#attachmentid"+id).remove();
[13:32:18] <Guest53835> Velveeta,  sorry, my bad, wait
[13:34:18] <brombomb> well in my existing code they do have them sparr...  My coworker informed me we're using a custom plugin for it, and it provides a method to grab them
[13:35:19] <brombomb> and for the curious their solution is $('li[selected]') (more or less)....
[13:35:31] <brombomb> the :selected selector doesn't work
[13:35:45] <sparr> brombomb: their plugin will determine what works and doesn't work, then
[13:36:15] <brombomb> no.... it works as valid jquery as well, without the plugin
[13:39:50] <rethus> Velveeta, great, works like a charm. Thanks a lot
[13:40:23] <Velveeta> good to hear
[13:45:23] <rethus> good bye

[13:49:19] <ReBa1> Hi, I have this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Wd9wE/ --> My javaScript executes perfectly in FireFox, Google Chrome and even IE10! But when I look at Safari, I get to see a header-wrapper of 10px... Does someone have a clue why everywhere it is rendered perfectly, but in not in Safari?
[13:50:36] <ReBa1> pedrommone: Where is that popup showing?
[13:50:41] <ReBa1> I don't have any popup coming up
[13:56:43] <doonie> hello friends!

[14:40:19] <shouvik> my bad on the localhost link *sheepish*. check this http://www.scholowiz.com/ hover on our work and click on framework. It stops above 200 px above framework
[16:20:37] <dlam> im moving some ad html via `adHTML.html()`  now, adHTML might contain an inline <script> document.write(...)  </script> which I don't want to run:  is there a way to make it not do that?
[16:20:52] <dlam> like right now, im just setting document.write = functino() {}  (and restoring it after)
[16:21:06] <dlam> mebbe there's jquery thing for it
[16:21:30] <duch_kazatel> dlam err, not really.
[16:22:05] <duch_kazatel> dlam you shouldn't be mucking with ad code in general anyway
[16:27:08] <dlam> yeah agree totally,   but dlam has "special ad requirements"  :D
[16:27:47] <duch_kazatel> either way, you'd have to capture the code before it gets written to the document, strip that out, then write it in.
[16:47:50] <shouvik> Facing issues in smooth scroll, can someone assist? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20387886/smooth-scroll-to-anchor-tag-stops-much-above-the-anchor-tag?noredirect=1#comment30442755_20387886
[17:22:53] <Ullarah> Hi everybody! Having a bit of trouble with this: http://paste.thezomg.com/12094/13862068/  For some reason setting the index as a variable doesn't work, what am I doing wrong?
[17:24:39] <duch_kazatel> Ullarah you can't change the index like that.
[17:24:46] <duch_kazatel> it's all ready defined by .each();
[17:25:33] <Ullarah> Ah ok, so how would I go about defining the variable. Since I want to use the first part of the 'index' which is 'i' ?
[17:26:27] <duch_kazatel> you don't define ind.
[17:26:31] <duch_kazatel> ind cannot be redefined.
[17:26:41] <duch_kazatel> so i'm not sure what you're trying to do.
[17:26:56] <Ullarah> Ok, see in my array, I have 'i':'#idn'.
[17:27:01] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to get the value #idn for 'i'?
[17:27:11] <duch_kazatel> that's not an array btw - that's an object
[17:27:34] <Ullarah> I want to make a variable with 'i'
[17:27:59] <duch_kazatel> as its value?
[17:28:35] <Ullarah> Oh nevermind, I just worked it out, ignore me. I have to create another object as you say and reference that.
[17:28:48] <Ullarah> Thanks for your help duch_kazatel!
[17:28:52] <duch_kazatel> no clue what you're on about, but glad you figured it out :)
[17:29:02] <Ullarah> Haha. My mind works in mysterious ways.
[17:29:26] <duch_kazatel> for future reference, in javascript, arrays use square brackets, objects use curly brackets
[17:30:38] <Ullarah> duch_kazatel: I was getting confused with using it, too early in the morning for object associative arrays :P
[17:31:04] <duch_kazatel> javascript doesn't actually have associative arrays - it has objects with properties, though you can largely treat them the same.
[17:31:17] <Ullarah> Yep, and that's how I 'fixed' my issue, haha.
[17:31:53] <duch_kazatel> all right.  well, enjoy yourself.
[18:01:28] <Pedroshow> can someone help me with popup issue? my page is triggering a popup without any code to do that!
[18:32:20] <louism2wash> Hey guys, If I set a click listener on div and then refer to that element from inside the click's function using $(this), is jquery creating a new object each time I reference $(this)?  Should I just be creating a variable that refers to $(this) instead to avoid the overhead due to object creation?  Thanks.
[18:32:43] <Velveeta> yes, and yes
[18:38:27] <louism2wash> Velveeta: thanks for the help
[18:40:12] <jwmann> I'm doing ('[data-wcmb-total]').data('wcmb-total', total).html(total); and the total on the page is actually changing but the source shows nothing happening.. How can I change this behaviour?
[18:43:21] <jwmann> I can confirm via console.log() that these data attributes ARE changing.
[19:28:46] <Velveeta> jwmann: still around and have a question?
[19:29:41] <jwmann> Velveeta: Yes! :)
[19:29:52] <Velveeta> alllllllrighty then, i have your answer
[19:30:17] <Velveeta> so there's a difference between your data-wcmb-total attribute and the wcmb-total data you're accessing
[19:31:17] <Velveeta> whenever you have a data-* attribute, jquery automatically creates access to those via its data() cache
[19:31:26] <Velveeta> but the data cache is separate from that attribute
[19:31:43] <Velveeta> if you modify one, you're not modifying the other
[19:31:45] <Velveeta> per se
[19:32:11] <Velveeta> if you want your changes to be reflected in the actual dom, you need to reference that attribute via the .attr() function
[19:32:34] <Velveeta> also, whenever you have a hyphenated attribute, property, data key, etc, you need to remove the hyphens and camelcase it for accessing it
[19:32:52] <Velveeta> so in this case, you'd want to check $('[data-wcmb-total']).data('wcmbTotal')
[19:33:00] <jwmann> Ahhhh okay.
[19:33:03] <Velveeta> that will actually hand you the value from that attribute
[19:33:43] <Velveeta> if you want the storage of it to be reflected in the dom as opposed to just the jquery data cache, then you need to do something like this instead $('[data-wcmb-total]').attr('data-wcmb-total', total)
[19:34:00] <Velveeta> so i might have lied about the hyphenated attribute and camelcasing
[19:34:21] <Velveeta> but for the .data() function purposes, you camelcase it, i can't remember if you need to camelcase it for the .attr() function or if you pass the literal string
[19:34:43] <Velveeta> but i'm gonna *guess* you do camelcase it, so maybe modify that to .attr('dataWcmbTotal', total)
[19:35:41] <jwmann> Okay!
[19:36:00] <jwmann> I read somewhere that attr() is not deprecated for the prop() is that true?
[19:36:18] <Velveeta> it's not deprecated, it's used in a different way
[19:36:34] <Velveeta> .attr() is for strictly modifying the attributes on an element, like what you see in the dom inspector
[19:36:44] <Velveeta> however, those attributes may not reflect the actual state of an element
[19:37:02] <Velveeta> so for example, if you have this: <input type="checkbox" checked="checked" id="test" />
[19:37:12] <jwmann> PS: I tried both camelCase and literal string and CamelCase didn't work but literal string did.
[19:37:22] <Velveeta> and via js, you do this: $('#test').trigger('click')
[19:37:51] <Velveeta> actually that's a bad example, something like this: $('#test')[0].checked = false;
[19:38:04] <Velveeta> then the checkbox will be unchecked, but the dom inspector may still show checked="checked"
[19:38:31] <Velveeta> because the actual checked attribute isn't necessarily reflective of what the checked state is on the element at any given time
[19:39:00] <Velveeta> so .attr() only modifies the attribute you'll see on the element in the inspector, but .prop() will reflect the actual state of the element property
[19:39:24] <Velveeta> so you can set .prop('readonly', true) and the element will be readonly at that point, even if the inspector doesn't show an attribute of readonly="readonly"
[19:39:55] <Ullarah> Hi, I'm just wondering if there is a better way to make dynamic variables from an object? http://paste.thezomg.com/12099/62149361/ The code I'm using works great, but just wondering :) Sorry if the code looks messy. I have only been using jQuery for about 3 weeks now.
[19:39:55] <Velveeta> the .attr() function used to handle both of those things, it would set the attribute as well as syncing the property with that setting
[19:40:04] <Velveeta> they split it out to be more proper about it
[19:41:27] <Velveeta> ullarah: that's not a bad example of something like that, we do something similar at times in our own code at my company, where we'll initialize a View object with selectors, and then in document.ready, we'll iterate over the object and assign the actual dom references over those keys
[19:41:46] <Ullarah> So it's fine to use?
[19:42:26] <Velveeta> sure, in that specific example, i don't know that you'll see a performance boost by scoping those dom lookups to 'ec' as upposed to just $(<selector>), since they're all id's
[19:42:35] <Velveeta> but if they were class names or something instead, you would for sure
[19:43:05] <Velveeta> now actually, you'll want to change ob's initialization from [] to {}
[19:43:15] <Velveeta> because you're creating an object map in your loop, instead of an array
[19:43:46] <Ullarah> Ah ok.
[19:44:17] <Ullarah> Thanks so much for your input Velveeta! :)
[19:44:37] <Velveeta> jwmann: did that kind of clear up the difference between .attr and .prop ?
[19:44:42] <Velveeta> ullarah: no problem :)
[19:45:05] <jwmann> Velveeta: Yes it did, Thank you so much for the help and the explanations! :)
[19:45:12] <Velveeta> you're welcome :)
[19:54:34] <jwmann> Hmm what's the easiest way to pass an unserialized php array to jquery?
[19:54:50] <jwmann> Should I json_encode it into an data-attr?
[19:58:27] <iwantoski> jwmann: What do you mean by pass an array to jquery from php? Like maybe it available as a variable for jquery to use?
[19:59:49] <jwmann> Sorta, I've tried it this way but I ran into the problem where I could dynamically grab that variable based on other dom elements - http://stackoverflow.com/a/4885796
[20:00:30] <jwmann> But I just found this and it looks very promising! - http://stackoverflow.com/a/6071653
[20:03:00] <iwantoski> uhm, well, I'd use JSON
[20:04:19] <jwmann> I kinda have to I think xD
[20:05:21] <iwantoski> So what's your issue?
[21:12:16] <raj> no action in over an hour? unbelievable
[21:14:32] <tw2113> i'd call that a good thing
[21:14:40] <tw2113> people aren't needing help
[21:19:03] <raj> perhaps
[21:20:27] <raj> ok, I have an input that accepts text. However, I want a little delay to give the user a few moments to finish writing their text before a function is run. How can I do that?
[21:21:01] <raj> so the function isn't run multiple times for each oninput, or whatever
[21:21:05] <raj> onchange, etc
[21:21:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: you could measure the time between keystrokes
[21:21:35] <raj>  I tried $.throttle and $.debounce, but they don't seem to execute the function at all
[21:21:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> using key down
[21:21:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> or keyup and then
[21:21:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> or evn better settimeout or setinterval
[21:21:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> after key up
[21:22:18] <raj> that wouldn't change the number of times the functoin is run Rohan_Bhangui
[21:22:28] <raj> it'll just delay the running of all of them
[21:22:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> settimeout would
[21:22:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> setitimeout
[21:23:49] <raj> no it wouldn't
[21:23:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> runs once
[21:23:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats it
[21:23:54] <raj> how?
[21:30:50] <raj> why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/2CLfy/
[21:32:15] <raj> actually, debounce is what I need http://jsfiddle.net/2CLfy/1/
[21:32:19] <raj> but still doesn't work
[21:32:21] <raj> not sure why
[21:44:03] <HugWolf> Hi guys, what's the best way of adding a delay to a forloop, I've done this: https://dpaste.de/Gsot but it's not working
[21:46:08] <HugWolf> does it have anything to do with the scope?
[21:49:05] <raj> HugWolf, setTimeout?
[21:53:33] <iwantoski> HugWolf: do you want to delay the for-loop itself?
[21:54:30] <iwantoski> because that will not work, its not about scope, it's about execution
[22:12:51] <b0fh_ua> Hello! I'm very new to jquery, how do I convert DOM element (table row) into jQuery object and then get named attribute?
[22:22:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> b0fh_ua: you have an id or class o nthat DOM
[22:22:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> for general rows you can od $("tr")
[22:28:19] <b0fh_ua> Rohan_Bhangui: https://gist.github.com/jdevelop/be627f8bcd86cb29be7f
[22:28:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> b0fh_ua: whats the issue
[22:29:23] <b0fh_ua> now I need to iterate over rows and check if ID of first TD exists in passed object, if it does - then replace content of some other cells in the same row
[22:29:54] <b0fh_ua> So I'm stuck if I need to convert "val" to jQuery object somehow and then apply selectors, or just use plain javascript
[22:37:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> well any string really can be passed into jquery object
[22:37:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> remember ajquery object is basically
[22:37:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> $(...)
[22:38:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> b0fh_ua: ^ with that in mind you should be able to test for the name attribute by doing somethign like $(...).attr("name");
[22:38:47] <iwantoski> b0fh_ua: $('<p>You just created a paragraph element.</p>')
[22:56:53] <scottmielcarski> raj: this is a while later, but removing the anonymous function, and listening on an 'input' event instead of a 'change' event fixes your issue. http://jsfiddle.net/PKr4k/
[23:04:40] <raj> scottmielcarski, ya, someone pointed that out to me earlier
[23:04:42] <raj> thank you
[23:05:17] <scottmielcarski> sorry mustve missed that, no problem
[23:42:52] <frosch> Hi!  Is there a jquery method available that can tell me how far some element is away from some other element in the DOM? Example: <div id="a"><div id="b"><button class="target">  -> onClick on #target I have to check whether div#a or div#b is closer to #target.
[23:44:23] <raj> frosch, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15149573/find-distance-between-two-divs-using-jquery
[23:44:25] <frosch> Currently I'm thinking of a counter which gets incremented while the function calls parent() and checks the parent against some selector in a loop
[23:44:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> frosch: you could use a combination of while loop and .previous or .next
[23:45:54] <frosch> raj: cool!  didn't think about .offset() at all... but in my case the coordinates should work. thanks!  I'll try that...
[23:46:11] <frosch> Rohan_Bhangui: thanks as well
[23:46:40] <Aquaword> morning
[23:47:12] <Aquaword> how to get the class from a $(this) object? the class is which is active, hovered..
[23:47:42] <raj> Aquaword, $(this).attr('class')
[23:48:03] <Aquaword> hm with that I had error .. let me check
[23:48:38] <Aquaword> no, working

[23:52:08] <mogaj> How to sort a json object
[23:52:09] <mogaj> ?
[23:55:16] <Cork> mogaj: you can't
[23:55:27] <raj> mogaj, convert it to an object :)
[23:55:29] <raj> then sort
[23:55:29] <Cork> json is a string you can't sort structures in it
[23:55:42] <Cork> also there is no way to sort an object
[23:55:46] <Cork> you need to create a new one
[23:56:19] <Cork> so if you want to sort json you need to
[23:56:41] <Cork> 1. convert it to an object, 2. loop the object and create a new object that is sorted
[23:56:51] <Cork> 3. stringify the object back to json
[23:57:06] <raj> 4. rinse and repeat as desired
[23:58:26] <mogaj> Cork : please the objects i need to sort here http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/nWs7z/ ... need to sort by room_number
[23:58:32] <mogaj> *see
[23:58:59] <Cork> mogaj: what browsers do you need support for?
[23:59:31] <Cork> btw those objects looks sorted already
[23:59:53] <Cork> or do you mean you need to sort the outer array based on something in the objects?
