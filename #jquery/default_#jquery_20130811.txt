[00:50:34] <ekkis> I'm having an issue with the UI accordion.  it doesn't seem to want to work when I load the divs up dynamically.  anyone around that's messed with that?
[01:02:44] <Hexagonite> Can anyone help me with an onscreen jQuery keyboard? I currently have this (http://jsfiddle.net/p37yL/), which I got from this guide (http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/creating-a-keyboard-with-css-and-jquery/)
[01:03:02] <Hexagonite> The keys doesn't seem to work
[01:05:56] <ekkis> Hexagonite: sorry dude... I've never worked with it
[01:15:26] <Hexagonite> Nevermind, it's fixed by replacing the last line with $write.val($write.val() + character);, if anyone's wondering.
[01:19:38] <jop008> I use add class but the new class is not reflected on the screen
[01:20:01] <jop008> I can find the object fine and then I use addclass
[01:20:44] <jop008> This is the code alert ( activeheader + " " + $("#" + activeheader) );  $("#" + activeheader).addClass( "ui-btn-active ui-state-persist" );
[01:25:53] <jop008> I tried this also $("#" + activeheader).attr("class", "ui-btn-active ui-state-persist" ); but still not okay
[01:36:28] <Quest> hi, its a javaee question but its more of a strategy question rather a php/javaee
[01:36:29] <Quest> I need to update the changed elements of a page every 10 seconds by ajax. I populate the elements in the first place on page load is by send an object to jsp. the iterating like wise. the object  are  e.g a board which have many boxes, and each box may have many tasts. tasks then have child nodes like text and title.  Now 1. how do I interchange/pass the data from ajax call and page. 2. how to see/compare for changes and reflect only the changed nodes/ obj
[01:36:29] <Quest> ects?
[02:14:08] <ekkis> can anyone tell me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/gc3zu/
[02:15:15] <ravenzz> ekkis Request is undefined, there is no such method in jQuery
[02:15:43] <ekkis> I was following the examples
[02:15:48] <ravenzz> ekkis the examples are using Mootools
[02:16:08] <ekkis> I thought Request was provided by jsfiddler as part of their ajax strategy
[02:16:13] <ekkis> ah... I see
[02:16:20] <ekkis> that's why I'm not familiar with it
[02:16:24] <ravenzz> eh
[02:16:48] <ekkis> they don't have examples that use jquery
[02:17:31] <ekkis> ravenzz: so if I wanted to make a $.ajax() call in jsfiddler how would I do it?
[02:18:03] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/gc3zu/1/
[02:18:11] <ravenzz> ekkis ^
[02:19:17] <ekkis> ravenzz: oh, that's simple.  cool
[02:29:07] <ekkis> ravenzz: curiously IE10 won't run jsfiddle
[02:29:25] <ekkis> I get an error of access denied on jquery... but chrome runs it fine
[02:46:21] <jop008> I have made my first fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/mYJKf/ but the result show no styles
[02:48:55] <pixelpimp> there is no styling

[03:35:25] <Quest> roflmaus,  ok
[03:52:11] <henn1nk> can i found an object by its data attribute?
[03:52:34] <henn1nk> $('data[my_id]') for example?
[03:53:05] <jop008> I have this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-08-11_at_12.50.48_PM-CnqrFVdH.png filled by this html http://pastebin.com/UkXHbPfm in a routine I build a string and use .html() to fill #activity
[03:53:18] <jop008> Why is the background not correct?
[03:57:10] <nicoekkart> henn1nk: $("[data-my_id]") will return all elements that have a data-my_id attribute
[03:57:20] <henn1nk> thanks
[03:59:23] <henn1nk> why does it not run? http://jsfiddle.net/LKbcm/
[04:04:00] <nicoekkart> henn1nk: several things. You haven't included jquery in your fiddle. .each only works on jquery elements
[04:04:19] <nicoekkart> You shouldn't return an alert
[04:04:45] <henn1nk> i can't use the coffeescript syntax in jsfiddle or?
[04:04:45] <nicoekkart> if you want each on an array, use $.each (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/)
[04:05:08] <henn1nk> oh i can. wait :D
[04:06:08] <henn1nk> nicoekkart: http://jsfiddle.net/LKbcm/1/
[04:06:59] <henn1nk> nicoekkart: so what i am doing wrong? :)
[04:07:04] <nicoekkart> I think you should be on the coffeescript channel for that, I don't know anything about it.
[04:07:14] <nicoekkart> http://jsfiddle.net/LKbcm/2/ works in jquery
[04:18:53] <henn1nk> nicoekkart: thanks, but would be nice to know how to do this in coffee :(
[04:21:50] <jop008> If I use this           <div data-role="fieldcontain" style="height:auto;" ><label for="activity" >Afstand tot Utrecht:</label><div class="divinfo" id="activity"></div>
[04:22:23] <jop008> I got a background color problem if I change stye height to 10 em
[04:23:03] <jop008> then tha page is better but I don't want the heigth with a  fixed size
[04:49:22] <roflmaus> jop008, use http://jsbin.com to demonstrate your problem

[04:51:28] <jop008> I tried js fiddle but without success
[04:52:47] <roflmaus> jop008, you will hardly find help without a demo on http://jsbin.com or similar service
[04:53:08] <jop008> Yes thanks
[04:53:15] <jop008> I know I tried
[04:58:03] <jop008> Here is my almost jsfiddle http://pastebin.com/erHfq9Ww
[05:03:00] <roflmaus> jop008, why don't you use http://jsbin.com
[05:03:01] <roflmaus> ?
[05:03:43] <jop008> because I don't know how to use it and any exmaples shown so far were with jsfiddle
[05:04:43] <roflmaus> jop008, are you using jQuery in the first place?

[05:07:05] <roflmaus> jop008, open http://jsbin.com, use the Libraries menu to select jQuery and jQuery Mobile, then paste your HTML, CSS and JS into corresponding fields, then use the Share menu to share a link.
[05:08:57] <jop008> the problem is that it is not rendered the way as on my screen but I try it again
[05:12:06] <jop008> I got it in jsbin
[05:12:12] <jop008> put no url to share
[05:12:18] <jop008> I didn't login
[05:12:42] <fooman2011> Hello, I would like to know from my javascript if the user is currently infront of the screen or not. In fact I would like to know if the user move its mouse or press a key on the keyboard.  So I have to get the mouse and keyboard event sent to the browser but outside of the browser too. Do you know how to do this ?
[05:13:02] <jop008> Maybe this http://jsbin.com/ekihiz/1/
[05:13:20] <jop008> that's the output view
[05:13:37] <jop008> Code view http://jsbin.com/ekihiz/1/edit
[05:14:01] <roflmaus> jop008, okay i see it, what is the problem?
[05:14:19] <jop008> the output
[05:14:28] <jop008> the box is out of his parent
[05:14:41] <jop008> divinfo style
[05:17:55] <nick07> i'm loading the mediaelement.js into a slider,and the controlbar is too small  when loading, when hoverout and hover in the bar -auto- adjusts.. how to resolve that?
[05:18:42] <roflmaus> jop008, i got it, one moment
[05:19:58] <nick07> so the problem looks only to be happing if the video is in a slider, if loaded outside the slider the player controls are correct width
[05:22:04] <roflmaus> jop008, here you go: http://jsbin.com/ekihiz/3/edit You use a float, and in order for a float not to appear outside of its container, the container should be clearfixed.
[05:23:28] <roflmaus> jop008, sorry, here's the correct link: http://jsbin.com/ekihiz/4/edit
[05:27:29] <fooman2011> I would like to "Detecting user idle from computer". NOTE! I want to detect all activity, even if my page in in backround. Ex: If user is writing it notepad(not in my page), id'd like still know that user is active..  Do you know a way to do this using javascript ?
[05:34:52] <jop008> I take a look
[05:35:36] <henn1nk> i am loading different elements via ajaxâ€¦ but know the new elements aren't recognized by jquery. how can i handle this?
[05:36:37] <rgr> I have two absolute divs with different parents. Whats the neatest JQ way to have a click make them appear top most. e.g click the background one and it appears over  the more foreground one. then click the new bg one and it becomes top most again (they overlap but both have visible clickable areas)
[05:44:30] <roflmaus> henn1nk, stir up jQuery against them after they've been created.
[05:44:48] <henn1nk> roflmaus: hm?
[05:45:07] <henn1nk> roflmaus: u mean i have to reload the jquery/js file too?
[05:45:20] <roflmaus> henn1nk, no, i mean do `$('.new-element').whatever;` again
[05:45:57] <henn1nk> roflmaus: but i handle click events
[05:46:21] <roflmaus> henn1nk, reapply `$('foo').click()`
[05:46:36] <henn1nk> roflmaus: how can i reapply them? Oo
[05:46:45] <sunbeam> Any bootstrap coders in here?
[05:46:59] <roflmaus> henn1nk, execute `$('foo').click()` again after new elements are created
[05:47:01] <jop008> So clear both did the trick?
[05:48:35] <roflmaus> jop008, google "clearfix"
[05:50:06] <sammich> if there are dynamic elements on the page which need events, look into this http://api.jquery.com/on/

[06:19:27] <nick07> anyone around?
[06:22:46] <nick07> how do i stop all classes with the same name (.player1) from playing html5 video?
[06:41:54] <Quest> I do need to write complex things and embeded objects though. I knew xml and sounded more simpler to me. but I dont know its support in java / JS . nor the advantages of JSON
[06:47:17] <duckgoose> xml is supported in both very nicely
[06:47:48] <duckgoose> but keep in mind java and javascript are two very different things
[06:48:21] <duckgoose> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[06:48:30] <Technical_13> And are not the same.
[06:50:17] <doug65536> jop008: hi
[06:50:29] <fooman2011> Using javascript, is there a way to detect that the pc is locked or the screensaver has started ?
[06:51:15] <jop008> With javascript I think not JS lives in the browser and I don't know a browser event that traps this
[06:51:34] <jop008> I try to update your code for the class stuf but not success full
[06:51:56] <fooman2011> There is nothing accessible from javascript which can help me to know if there is the user is infront the pc or not ?
[06:52:02] <jop008> I learned another bug in CSS using clearfix
[06:53:58] <fooman2011> If not, is there a way to do this ? Maybe adding a plugin ?  asking for permission ? or anything else ?
[06:55:25] <Quest> duckgoose, Technical_13  i know the diff b/w java and js,  i am confused which to use.  xml is just more taggy but easy to read. hi, its a javaee question but its more of a strategy question rather a php/javaee
[06:55:25] <Quest> I need to update the changed elements of a page every 10 seconds by ajax.

[06:55:25] <Quest> ects?
[06:58:12] <sammich> Quest: still stuck on this? So you have a page with data loaded via ajax. Then every 10 seconds you want to update this data?
[06:58:40] <Quest> sammich,  yes
[06:58:53] <Quest> sammich,  only the changed ones
[06:58:59] <sammich> why not just recall the same ajax?
[06:59:04] <henn1nk> ehm how can i test if an var is in an array?
[06:59:05] <sammich> redraw the whole page
[06:59:16] <sammich> henn1nk: you don't
[06:59:35] <sammich> you can test if a value is in an array, but not an exact var
[06:59:35] <henn1nk> sammich: ?
[06:59:43] <henn1nk> sammich: sorry value of course
[07:00:03] <sammich> is it a simple array? ie string/number?
[07:00:14] <Quest> sammich,  redrawing the full page would be just reloading it
[07:00:27] <sammich> Quest: not really.
[07:01:09] <sammich> suppose you have a table with all your data. You just draw up the HTML for the table, and replace the HTML for just that table
[07:01:22] <Quest> sammich,  ok. wel either way. what to use. xml or json
[07:02:27] <sammich> Quest: alternatively, if that table had an edit function, and you kept track of those changes, you could submit a listing of only the relevant row IDs that have changed, then your server side app will just retrieve a listing of the data associated with those IDs
[07:02:50] <sammich> Quest: does it matter, both XML and JSON can hold data
[07:03:10] <sammich> though, if you were asking me, JSON is better for data
[07:03:21] <Quest> ya. iam just confused which one to use and why. json or xml
[07:03:22] <sammich> XML is far too verbose
[07:03:27] <Quest> how json is better for data
[07:03:53] <sammich> http://stackoverflow.com/a/3537499/1353224
[07:03:57] <Quest> xml only has an aditional overhead of </closingtage>   thats it
[07:04:11] <sammich> multiply that for every single individual data element, yeah
[07:06:05] <Quest> ok. but what else?
[07:06:21] <Quest> if simplicity is gained by some 7 extra chars every line. worth it?
[07:09:09] <sammich> verbosity != better
[07:09:17] <sammich> it's not simple
[07:09:37] <sammich> have you tried reading an XML document?
[07:10:05] <sammich> your eyes have to wade through all the closing tags to find the 'meat'
[07:10:10] <Quest> yes
[07:10:19] <Quest> hm
[07:10:28] <sammich> not that you'd be reading them anyway
[07:10:42] <sammich> I need to find you a decent example
[07:11:01] <sammich> http://json.org/example.html
[07:11:15] <sammich> the second last one is fairly clear
[07:11:19] <sammich> or not
[07:11:43] <sammich> the thing I like about JSON is that it's a distinct key:value pair
[07:12:25] <sammich> I can also write up a JSON structure by hand, and I don't need to keep track of anything more than how many braces I need
[07:17:22] <Quest> sammich,  i dont now even see an overhead of </closingTage> in the link  http://json.org/example.html   second example     <menuitem value="New" onclick="CreateNewDoc()" />
[07:21:13] <sammich> I'm just going to make it easy for you
[07:21:18] <sammich> Quest: use JSON
[07:21:22] <raj> if I have--> `function myfunc() { $('#something').on('click', function(){ return }); alert('hi'); }` ... will the alert happen?
[07:21:22] <sammich> I'm leaving now
[07:22:32] <sammich> PS: if you read that StackO post, it says that JSON stores data in a format well suited for data
[07:22:34] <Quest> hm
[07:22:47] <Quest> thanks sammich !!
[07:22:57] <sammich> XML by it's nature is typeless as wel
[07:23:07] <sammich> so more ambiguous for data
[07:23:16] <Quest> my document was more of a tree shape . may be thats why i hesitated
[07:23:19] <sammich> it's not 'wrong', but it's not the idea solution
[07:23:27] <Quest> hierarchy and tree shape
[07:23:30] <sammich> it doesn't matter what form that data is in
[07:23:44] <Quest> hm
[07:23:45] <sammich> if it's data (strings, numbers, structs), use JSON
[07:23:46] <Quest> ok..
[07:24:00] <Quest> thanks
[07:24:14] <Quest> sammich,  do rss feeds come in json?
[07:24:19] <Quest> or its still xml based?
[07:24:31] <sammich> it's a confusing boundary between XML and JSON, I'll agree, but I can safely say for you, use JSON
[07:24:44] <sammich> Quest: what's RSS?
[07:24:54] <Quest> RSS new feeds for example
[07:24:57] <sammich> (I know what it is, I'm just surprised it's actually still a thing)
[07:25:01] <sammich> or was ever a thing
[07:25:15] <Quest> en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS
[07:25:35] <Quest> sammich,  what do you mean
[07:25:38] <sammich> the amount of information RSS provides is about as much as a tweet can provide
[07:26:03] <sammich> I seriously doubt the usefulness of the RSS feed
[07:26:40] <sammich> gotta go
[07:27:23] <Quest> thanks. bye :)

[07:36:04] <doug65536> is it something quick?
[07:36:19] <nick07> how do i stop a <video> from playing when I click another <video> on same page?
[07:36:34] <nick07> video in .player
[07:36:50] <nick07> or #player1,#player2 ect
[07:37:40] <doug65536> nick07: call pause() should work
[07:38:04] <nick07> any good examples of that?
[07:39:43] <doug65536> $('video').each(function() { this[0].pause(); });   should work
[07:39:52] <doug65536> to pause all videos
[07:40:07] <doug65536> do that right before playing new video
[07:40:54] <doug65536> brb
[07:47:13] <nick07> thx will try that
[07:58:20] <nick07> found this, that worked; $('video, audio').each(function() {       $(this)[0].pause(); });
[07:58:37] <nick07> huh wait
[07:58:49] <nick07> that's your code sorry
[07:59:49] <nick07> thx doug!I worked too hard today, so i need some rest!
[08:00:02] <doug65536> nick07: try $('video').each(function() { this.pause(); });   <-- might be more efficient
[08:00:10] <nick07> ow
[08:00:21] <doug65536> I forgot that .each gives you raw elements
[08:01:18] <doug65536> $(this)[0] is redundant
[08:01:32] <nick07> ah i see
[08:01:38] <doug65536> this is already equal to $(this)[0]
[08:01:39] <nick07> 1 question

[08:03:07] <nick07> i really need to find that issue, can you look through that script why the image jumps back?

[08:36:07] <nick07> i bought a slider, this slider jumps back to the first image every time when i close it
[08:36:25] <nick07> i cannot find the code that does that
[08:36:48] <nick07> would you mind check it why it does that?
[08:46:21] <nick07> i'm away to eat..
[08:49:48] <ericx2x> Hey guys, I'm really new to Jquery and I need to use it for a website I'm working on for a client.
[08:50:25] <ericx2x> I have a slider that has a "learn more" button and I need to make it link to the page the corresponds appropriate slide. http://protimeter.erictheprogrammer.com/
[08:51:22] <ericx2x> I'm using some slider that was given to me to use. Here is what the JS file looks like, I'm sorry I'm putting this on JSfiddle, its a lot of lines. http://jsfiddle.net/9nqcZ/
[08:51:38] <ericx2x> Does anyone know the easiest way to make that learn more button link to the appropriate slide?
[08:52:19] <ericx2x> it travels through three slides and I want the learn more link to change based upon which slide its currently on
[08:57:31] <codepython777> I need to generate html from a string array : Something like <div class="myclass" style="background: #8fd4d3">Name_i</div> ... - I have an array of names - how can i create the html and insert it in another div?
[08:57:33] <doug65536> ericx2x: having a look...
[08:57:48] <ericx2x> doug65536 thanks
[09:00:27] <doug65536> codepython777: $('#somecontainer).append($('div').addClass('myclass').css({background: '#8fd4d3'}).text(name))
[09:01:02] <doug65536> codepython777: oops, typo: $('#somecontainer').append($('div').addClass('myclass').css({background: '#8fd4d3'}).text(name))
[09:02:12] <codepython777> Lemme try, thanks
[09:05:13] <codepython777> doug65536: Is there a problem in this one: $('#myclass').append($('div').addClass('myclass').css({background: data[i]}).text(data[i])); - myclass just vanishes after this
[09:06:00] <doug65536> codepython777: I'll make a quick fiddle...
[09:06:01] <shoky> $('div')  ->    $('<div>')
[09:06:19] <doug65536> yes
[09:06:26] <doug65536> thank
[09:06:27] <doug65536> s
[09:06:53] <codepython777> ah
[09:07:06] <codepython777> indeed
[09:07:07] <codepython777> thanks
[09:09:52] <doug65536> codepython777: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Pymj4/1/
[09:13:01] <ericx2x> wow thats cool i didnt know u can do that with JS
[09:13:16] <ericx2x> anyhow doug did u take a look?
[09:13:22] <ericx2x> doug65536
[09:14:04] <doug65536> ericx2x: yes I looked...
[09:14:10] <doug65536> ericx2x: I haven't seen a way yet
[09:14:15] <ericx2x> =x
[09:14:16] <doug65536> it provides a way to go next, prev
[09:14:22] <ericx2x> is it that difficult of a task?
[09:14:25] <ericx2x> hm
[09:14:26] <doug65536> perhaps you could call next or prev several times?
[09:14:48] <doug65536> ericx2x: yeah, odd that it doesn't document a way to do that
[09:15:22] <ericx2x> h,
[09:15:28] <ericx2x> do you know of any other sliders?
[09:15:32] <ericx2x> that can do this sort of thing
[09:15:41] <ericx2x> I remember I got linked to an awesome slider before
[09:15:45] <ericx2x> I forgot the link though
[09:17:03] <Pratyya> bye guys
[09:20:05] <doug65536> ericx2x: there are many image sliders
[09:20:38] <ericx2x> do you know of any that could have some element like a button that can link to a seperate page?
[09:20:42] <ericx2x> im looking for one
[09:20:54] <ericx2x> although im not sure if my client will allow me to use another slider
[09:21:05] <doug65536> the button has to be on the image?
[09:22:05] <doug65536> ericx2x: you don't really mean separate page right? you mean a button that takes you to a specific image?
[09:22:20] <ericx2x> no sorry
[09:22:25] <ericx2x> i need to be more clear
[09:22:30] <ericx2x> i mean that same button
[09:22:32] <ericx2x> called learn more
[09:22:40] <ericx2x> will link to a three different pages
[09:22:47] <ericx2x> depending upon which slide its currently on
[09:23:00] <ericx2x> so for instance, if its on the mms2 slide it will link to the mms2 page
[09:23:01] <doug65536> ericx2x: ok that I might be able to figure out
[09:23:06] <ericx2x> oh cool
[09:23:21] <doug65536> I would have to modify the plugin slightly
[09:23:28] <ericx2x> yeah thats fine
[09:23:37] <ericx2x> thanks
[09:23:39] <ericx2x> for the help
[09:23:50] <sunbeam> Anyone knows whether it is okay to change the .container width in bootstrap3?
[09:26:21] <doug65536> ericx2x: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9nqcZ/1/
[09:26:43] <doug65536> ericx2x: I added a function, current_image_info(). it returns an object with current_slide and current_image properties
[09:26:48] <ericx2x> ok
[09:27:25] <ericx2x> um
[09:27:42] <doug65536> var info = $('#my_slider').current_image_info();  info.current_image     is the image, info.current_slide is a slide number
[09:28:03] <doug65536> ericx2x: add lines 618 thru 624
[09:28:08] <ericx2x> im new to Jquery, do you know a way I can easily make this into a pack file?
[09:28:10] <doug65536> added*
[09:28:19] <ericx2x> ok ill add those lines then nvm
[09:28:53] <doug65536> you have to modify the plugin - it deliberately hides that data inside where you can't get at it (and screw it up :)
[09:29:24] <doug65536> I just create a little object and return it that has the info
[09:29:40] <doug65536> ericx2x: oops, typo!
[09:29:54] <ericx2x> oh theres a type?
[09:29:57] <ericx2x> typo*
[09:29:59] <ericx2x> can u fix it
[09:30:04] <ericx2x> im going to pack the JS file
[09:30:08] <ericx2x> sry
[09:30:27] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9nqcZ/4/
[09:30:32] <ericx2x> thanks
[09:30:50] <doug65536> I can't test it, but I expect it to work - very simple change
[09:30:55] <doug65536> (famous last words)
[09:31:43] <ericx2x> yea
[09:32:00] <ericx2x> gimme a few minutes lol
[09:32:11] <ericx2x> i need to figure out how to get your changes into a .pack.js file correctly
[09:32:18] <ericx2x> by copy and pasting somehow
[09:32:39] <doug65536> ericx2x: find settings.afterLoad.call(this);
[09:33:23] <doug65536> put   this.current_image_info=function(){return{current_slide: vars.current_slide,current_image: vars.current_image};};   before it
[09:33:48] <doug65536> put   this.current_image_info=function(){return{current_slide:vars.current_slide,current_image:vars.current_image};};   before it
[09:38:12] <ericx2x> man im confused
[09:38:20] <ericx2x> i cant find settings.afterload in the pack file
[09:38:38] <ericx2x> i guess the pack file is different?
[09:38:45] <ericx2x> im not sure how pack file work exactly
[09:39:12] <ericx2x> i have jquery.nivo.slider.js and jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js
[09:39:24] <doug65536> what is the pack file filename
[09:39:30] <doug65536> ok
[09:39:40] <ericx2x> im pretty sure if i want to get changes to work i need to put them in the pack.js file correct?
[09:40:10] <ericx2x> shouldnt the pack.js file be the same as the other file?
[09:40:23] <ericx2x> just formated differently to be more efficient for the computer to run?
[09:40:29] <doug65536> yes
[09:40:46] <doug65536> I'll look at it...
[09:41:23] <doug65536> when I said find I didn't mean find with your eyes
[09:41:28] <doug65536> use find in text editor!
[09:41:36] <doug65536> wait though...
[09:41:38] <ericx2x> yea i know
[09:41:41] <ericx2x> this is my pack file
[09:41:42] <ericx2x> http://jsfiddle.net/PEStQ/
[09:41:42] <doug65536> it is minified, so names changed
[09:41:58] <ericx2x> oh
[09:42:11] <ericx2x> so i cant simply use ctrl+f to locate it?
[09:42:36] <doug65536> use ctrl+f to find    r.afterLoad.call(this);    and put the line I showed you above BEFORE it
[09:43:04] <doug65536> oh wait...
[09:43:08] <doug65536> needs name changed
[09:44:37] <ericx2x> ok
[09:44:47] <ericx2x> that is what im thinking
[09:45:02] <ericx2x> so the pack changes the more than i was expecting
[09:45:08] <ericx2x> is there a converter or something?
[09:45:36] <ericx2x> should i use http://javascriptcompressor.com/ ?
[09:45:41] <doug65536> no
[09:46:17] <doug65536> put   this.current_image_info=function(){return{current_slide:i.current_slide,current_image:i.current_image};};   before    r.afterLoad.call(this);
[09:46:32] <ericx2x> how do you know
[09:46:32] <doug65536> oops
[09:46:45] <doug65536> put   this.current_image_info=function(){return{current_slide:i.currentSlide,current_image:i.currentImage};};   before    r.afterLoad.call(this);
[09:46:53] <doug65536> from looking at it
[09:47:24] <doug65536> from looking at var i={currentSlide:0,currentImage:"",totalSlides: ... etc ...
[09:49:46] <ericx2x> ok
[09:49:48] <ericx2x> i put that line there
[09:49:53] <ericx2x> but what does that change exactly?
[09:50:41] <doug65536> now you can do $('#slider_element_id').current_image_info(). it returns an object with current_slide and current_image information
[09:50:51] <doug65536> I told you already above
[09:51:03] <doug65536> var info = $('#my_slider').current_image_info();  info.current_image     is the image, info.current_slide is a slide number
[09:51:47] <doug65536> replace #my_slider with the selector for the slider element
[09:52:04] <ericx2x> ok
[09:52:11] <ericx2x> so i put this in the html file?
[09:54:13] <doug65536> ericx2x: do you know how to attach an event handler to a link?
[09:54:29] <ericx2x> no
[09:54:42] <ericx2x> sorry
[09:54:51] <doug65536> how do you know which link to send them to?
[09:54:59] <doug65536> do you have a list?
[09:55:02] <ericx2x> yea
[09:55:15] <ericx2x> its the same links as the explore tab
[09:55:18] <ericx2x> the three links
[09:55:21] <ericx2x> correspond
[09:55:42] <doug65536> I guess I could do the whole job for you...
[09:55:55] <ericx2x> =x
[09:55:58] <ericx2x> sorry
[09:56:01] <doug65536> can you tell me a link to the page?
[09:56:04] <ericx2x> MMS2
[09:56:08] <ericx2x> so /mms2
[09:56:24] <ericx2x> i mean u can link to google or whatever
[09:56:46] <ericx2x> just try linking to google for slide 1, yahoo for slide 2 and cnn for slide 3
[09:57:21] <doug65536> if you don't know how to attach a click handler, how will you write the code?
[09:57:33] <doug65536> I would have to give you exact copy/paste code
[09:57:54] <ericx2x> sorry
[09:57:58] <ericx2x> i wish i were better at this
[09:58:00] <doug65536> mineral solutions?
[09:59:33] <ericx2x> doug65536 are you asking for where to link to?
[10:00:02] <doug65536>  /msg me if you are afraid to post to main channel
[10:00:49] <doug65536> if you can't bother to copy and paste a link, then find someone else to help you
[10:12:23] <nick07> back
[10:12:45] <nick07> doug still around?
[10:15:22] <grafi> i bet he is if you highlight him
[10:15:36] <grafi> doug65536 doug65536 doug65536
[10:15:41] <grafi> beetlejuice!
[10:15:48] <doug65536> nick07: hi
[10:16:43] <nick07> so, want to look at that script for a sec?
[10:17:19] <doug65536> yeah ok
[10:19:08] <nick07> any idea where i can drop a save line?
[10:19:32] <doug65536> jsfiddle.net?
[10:21:12] <nick07> it is copyrighted code..
[10:21:31] <nick07> don't know if i'm allowed to post it to fiddle?
[10:21:42] <RRR2> perhaps..
[10:28:13] <tw2113> if it's javascript, then anyone viewing the page could get to it anyway
[10:29:12] <nick07> how does codecanyon does that with their examples?
[10:29:38] <grafi> minify, obfuscate
[10:29:57] <grafi> not very helpful when trying to get help^^
[10:31:21] <nick07> i see
[10:32:21] <nick07> doesn't feel right to put the code on the internet thought O_o
[10:32:38] <tw2113> why not
[10:32:50] <nick07> because  of the license agreement
[10:33:06] <grafi> well dont then ^^
[10:33:22] <tw2113> what are we going to use it for? world domination
[10:33:24] <tw2113> ?
[10:33:35] <grafi> i would certainly try tw2113
[10:33:51] <tw2113> yeah, i probably would too
[10:33:58] <tw2113> nick07, best leave it not fiddled
[10:33:59] <nick07> ;)
[10:34:01] <grafi> xD
[10:34:26] <grafi> i should sell my javascript
[10:34:34] <grafi> if i had any
[10:34:35] <grafi> ...
[10:34:57] <grafi> under the "do not upload to the internet license"
[10:35:11] <grafi> nobody could ever use it
[10:35:22] <nick07> mm
[10:35:32] <nick07> so i'm afraid for nothing?
[10:36:11] <grafi> i dont even know
[10:37:48] <nick07> maybe there is some program that traces jquery's steps?
[10:38:11] <nick07> I find it myself where it go's wrong
[10:39:19] <grafi> you could start by telling us what plugin you are using and what error you are getting
[10:39:20] <grafi> ^^+
[10:40:38] <nick07> bought this on : http://codecanyon.net/item/jsprouts/4362842?WT.ac=search_item&WT.seg_1=search_item&WT.z_author=GreenTreeLabs Problem: image always go's back to first when closes
[10:43:51] <grafi> sounds buggy
[10:44:26] <nick07> any idea?
[10:44:42] <nick07> don;t know if you see the minified version?
[10:47:15] <grafi> nah
[10:47:29] <grafi> message the plugin author
[10:47:31] <grafi> ^^
[10:47:50] <nick07> did that
[10:48:05] <nick07> he's away for a while
[10:48:36] <grafi> as in he didnt answer?
[10:49:25] <nick07> as in no time on vacation :D
[10:51:03] <grafi> talk about bad support ^^
[10:52:15] <nick07> i just want to solve it sooner :D can'twait
[10:56:39] <gordian> good responsive image script?
[10:57:19] <doug65536> nick07: closes?
[10:57:42] <doug65536> nick07: you left without giving me anything to look at
[10:59:02] <grafi> i think when the overlay closes the image switsches back to the frist one, not the one you selected
[10:59:07] <doug65536> nick07: yes you can find out where it is going wrong with a debugger
[10:59:16] <doug65536> he's gone again is he?
[10:59:22] <grafi> no
[10:59:28] <grafi> at least hes in the channel
[10:59:29] <grafi> ^^
[10:59:55] <grafi> i never stepped through a script with firebug
[10:59:56] <grafi> oÃ´
[11:00:20] <nick07> i;m here
[11:00:20] <doug65536> grafi: chrome can break on exception
[11:00:35] <grafi> well its not an exception though
[11:00:38] <grafi> i think
[11:00:53] <grafi> it just goes back to start
[11:01:02] <doug65536> nick07: what do you mean "when closes"
[11:01:22] <doug65536> <nick07> bought this on : http://codecanyon.net/item/jsprouts/4362842?WT.ac=search_item&WT.seg_1=search_item&WT.z_author=GreenTreeLabs Problem: image always go's back to first when closes
[11:01:31] <nick07> ehm
[11:01:53] <nick07> when mouse leave the slider and then go back in
[11:02:08] <nick07> image jumps back to first LI
[11:02:35] <grafi> should be easy enough to fix
[11:02:43] <grafi> do you have an unminified version?
[11:03:29] <nick07> yes i did buy the whole script
[11:04:00] <doug65536> nick07: do you have that up on a working website that I can go to and see if I can debug it?
[11:04:53] <nick07> unfortunally not...
[11:05:10] <doug65536> good luck then
[11:06:07] <nick07> kay thx
[11:07:11] <doug65536> nick07: there's no documentation on the site and there's no code to look at so I am unable to help
[11:07:25] <nick07> i understand.
[11:07:30] <grafi> actually there is
[11:07:32] <grafi> ^^
[11:07:46] <grafi> @ doug65536 http://romanovian.com/laboratorio/jsprouts/
[11:08:06] <doug65536> grafi: where is the documentation
[11:08:08] <nick07> ha that's smart
[11:08:17] <doug65536> I was already there
[11:08:24] <grafi> apparantely there is none
[11:08:27] <grafi> but the code is there
[11:10:04] <nick07> can you do anything without a documentation?
[11:10:30] <doug65536> I can't do much without seeing your code
[11:11:04] <nick07> it's the same as: http://romanovian.com/laboratorio/jsprouts/
[11:11:09] <doug65536> it's all lumped together into a bootstrap mess
[11:11:15] <nick07> ah ok
[11:12:30] <nick07> thx for your time, i will wait for the author
[11:12:35] <gordian> doug65536: have a good recommendation for and adaptive image script?
[11:12:58] <gordian> i've been looking at riloadr.js (https://github.com/tubalmartin/riloadr)
[11:14:32] <nick07> have a good day, bye
[11:15:27] <doug65536> gordian: that one looks really good
[11:15:53] <gordian> documentation isn't particularly straightforward though unfortunately
[11:18:07] <doug65536> gordian: looks alright. are you having a problem?
[11:18:09] <grafi> now hes gone
[11:18:10] <grafi> oÃ´
[11:18:14] <grafi> and i have the answer
[11:18:17] <grafi> oÃ´
[11:18:21] <gordian> doug65536: yes, but not a specific problem
[11:18:36] <gordian> i don't understand how it works or how i need to setup my images :P
[11:18:53] <gordian> maybe my adderall just needs to kick in
[11:18:53] <doug65536> gordian: do you understand breakpoints?
[11:18:59] <gordian> yes, very much
[11:19:21] <grafi> doug65536 do you know any way to contact nick07 ?
[11:19:28] <doug65536> grafi: no
[11:19:35] <grafi> oh well
[11:19:38] <grafi> his fault
[11:19:40] <grafi> :P
[11:21:08] <doug65536> gordian: you specify your breakpoints and names, then you have images with data-src attribute
[11:21:16] <gordian> doug65536: even looking at the demo page, i don't see a difference in page weight
[11:21:21] <doug65536> <img class="responsive" data-src="../Hollywood-{breakpoint-name}.jpg">
[11:22:10] <doug65536> gordian: does that make sense?
[11:24:12] <doug65536> gordian: let's say you had 2 breakpoints, one named Tablet and the other named Desktop. your img tags would have that example img tag I mentioned above, and riloadr would load ../Hollywood-Tablet.jpg or ../Hollywood-Desktop.jpg
[11:27:54] <doug65536> gordian: it will defer loading until images are near the viewing area, watch the browser size and automatically load new images at the breakpoints, it can check connection speed and limit image sizes for slow connections...
[11:28:31] <doug65536> you can point it at a container element to limit which images it tries to control
[11:29:44] <doug65536> gordian: do you have different sized images to use? if not, you can just use the lazy load functionality
[11:33:03] <basic6_> I have many buttons that trigger a AJAX request and I want the clicked button to be replaced with a loader GIF. I've found several complicated plugins and also blockUI seems very nice and simple ($this.block(message:null) done), but it won't show a GIF. any tips?
[11:34:28] <gordian> doug65536: i think i understand the basics
[11:34:47] <gordian> of course it doesn't help that i'm trying to implement this in WordPress
[11:34:57] <gordian> well, it kinda does
[11:35:05] <gordian> at least it will generate image thumbnails
[11:35:18] <gordian> just need to figure out how to weave the two together
[11:35:31] <gordian> i know there's a Riloadr for WP plugin but i don't like using premade WP plugins
[11:35:36] <gordian> â€¦ if i can help it
[11:35:45] <gordian> somethign like this seems easy enough without the need for one
[11:43:18] <mobile8> what's a good plugin to have some text fly in, from left to right?
[11:43:22] <mobile8> text/elements
[11:43:44] <gordian> mobile8: flexslider
[11:43:57] <gordian> https://github.com/woothemes/FlexSlider/
[11:44:12] <mobile8> thats a slide plugin
[11:44:24] <gordian> correct
[11:44:29] <mobile8> I use this for many times
[11:44:37] <mobile8> do you have any examplof what i mean?
[11:44:52] <gordian> do *I* have an example of what *YOU* mean?
[11:45:02] <gordian> hahaha how would that work?
[11:45:10] <mobile8> Yes, elements,  fly in from left to right
[11:45:27] <mobile8> Because that's *not* what this plugin can
[11:45:28] <gordian> mayeb you should think about giving an example
[11:45:31] <mobile8> ok sec
[11:45:45] <mobile8> let me see if I can find any
[11:45:49] <gordian> flexslider does that though, and relatively well
[11:45:57] <mobile8> its a slides carrousel
[11:46:00] <mobile8> Completely different
[11:46:10] <gordian> mkay
[11:48:25] <mobile8> gordian: http://jsfiddle.net/DonamiteIsTNT/KaTNH/5/
[11:48:38] <mobile8> I can do it using animate()
[11:48:47] <mobile8> but, isn't there some plugin that helps with this, with better effects etc
[11:49:03] <gordian> ummmm
[11:49:08] <gordian> jQuery might be a good one
[11:49:11] <gordian> look into it
[11:49:13] <gordian> ;-)
[11:49:26] <gordian> just write your own function
[11:50:08] <mobile8> regarding the effect? elastic
[11:50:11] <mobile8> how
[11:50:23] <basic6_> how could i put a loader gif on top of a button (centered)?
[11:50:24] <gordian> i don't understand what you want
[11:52:02] <basic6_> gordian: when a button is clicked, there should be a gif image (ajax loader) on it, the button should remain in the background, disabled
[11:52:32] <basic6_> (or the button could disappear as well, but the loader gif should be there)
[11:54:19] <gordian> basic6_: the best way to do that might be to position the element exactly where you want it to show up
[11:54:30] <gordian> then use css to set visibility: hidden
[11:54:49] <gordian> then use click() to add/remove a class
[11:56:07] <basic6_> gordian: i'm looking for an out of the box solution. i could write something myself and figure out how to make it look good. but i just want to call $this.showLoader() and $this.hideLoader. on any button.
[11:56:35] <mobile8> gordian: ok, given I do this with jQuery
[11:56:45] <mobile8> there is really no way to have this working responsive
[11:56:48] <mobile8> correct?
[11:57:08] <gordian> mobile8: i still don't understand what you want
[11:57:22] <gordian> basic6_: i'm not aware of anything out of the box
[11:57:48] <gordian> but you should be able to accomplish what i wrote in a few lines
[11:57:50] <gordian> maybe 10
[11:58:13] <basic6_> gordian: there must be a busload of jquery plugins that do that. only the things that i've seen in the past always had flaws
[11:58:26] <basic6_> anyway i'll write something myself then
[11:58:27] <gordian> jquery is capable of doing that on its own
[11:58:33] <gordian> why add another plugin?
[11:58:39] <gordian> you're going to add a ton of weight to your app
[11:58:55] <gordian> jqueryUI might have something like that
[11:59:16] <mobile8> gordian: http://jsfiddle.net/KaTNH/1032/
[11:59:18] <mobile8> this effect
[12:01:14] <mobile8> Don't see how you can make this effect responsive
[12:04:24] <gordian> instead of animating it to a fixed value animate it to a percentage of $(window).width
[12:05:03] <beachandbytes> I would just attach a spinner show event to the ajaxstart/end
[12:05:09] <beachandbytes> then append the element on the button click event
[12:11:59] <mobile8> gordian: yep thats what i would thought
[12:12:01] <mobile8> but the issue is
[12:12:07] <mobile8> If it are 10 text elements next to each other
[12:12:33] <mobile8> with % you can't be sure they will be exactly next to each other , right?
[12:13:33] <gordian> basic6_: http://jsfiddle.net/gGv65/
[12:14:16] <gordian> mobile8: there's probably a way but i can't think that far ahead without an example
[12:14:20] <gordian> sorry
[12:14:24] <gordian> i'm very visual
[12:18:50] <mobile8> no problem
[12:19:05] <mobile8> I can figure out something myself thanks for help
[12:22:04] <grafi> basic6_ http://lab.hakim.se/ladda/

[12:41:44] <jt_000_jesse> but my jQuery isn't working
[12:43:06] <jt_000_jesse> I am trying to get my accordian hover to work, as with this link here:  http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#hoverintent
[12:43:31] <grafi> have a fiddle/live site?
[12:43:43] <jt_000_jesse> I have the appropriate code in place, as far as I know, but it does not do the desired effect.
[12:44:01] <jt_000_jesse> grafi I do not know what that means
[12:44:47] <grafi> im just asking to see your code
[12:45:05] <Krambiorix> hi, i made a div draggable and the dropped it and gave it another class. on init (when the div is created initially) I try to put the draggable event already on it :   $(".aci").draggable({                but this doesn't do it (no class has been added to the dropped layer)   How can i make it work?
[12:45:19] <grafi> which you could put up on http://jsfiddle.net or give us a link to a live site
[12:47:08] <Krambiorix> grafi, all elements are created with ajax
[12:48:55] <ra1n> i'm trying to setup a slider in my header, but its pretty complex. i've got so many divs and logos that are stacked on top of each other in this div and for some reason  i just cant get the slider to load. i actually gave up cause it was that frustrating
[12:49:32] <jt_000_jesse> ra1n: sliders are easy, just eliminate other elements until you see it
[12:50:29] <jt_000_jesse> ra1n: and make sure your x-order is proper
[12:50:45] <ra1n> honestly thats whats held me back i've had this design for like 1 year and i just never got round to finishing it cause of the damned slider
[12:50:47] <ra1n> lol
[12:51:19] <jt_000_jesse> ra1n: me too... darn thing "where the heck is it!?!"....
[12:52:13] <jt_000_jesse> so no one can help me with my jQuery accordion question?
[12:53:00] <jt_000_jesse> :(
[12:53:17] <naeluh> yo!
[12:54:22] <jt_000_jesse> naeluh:  you know jQuery?
[12:54:40] <naeluh> jt_000_jesse: what do yo mean?
[12:55:10] <jt_000_jesse> naeluh: so you use jquery, are you familiar with the accordion?
[12:55:47] <naeluh> I mean sort of which one ? do you have a fiddle or some jsbin I could look at ?
[12:56:19] <jt_000_jesse> this one, naeluh >> http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#hoverintent
[12:56:36] <jt_000_jesse> I have the control on my page, but the "hover" doesn't work
[12:57:13] <jt_000_jesse> it works on their site, in the demo, but for me it does not work, and I have copy and pasted the same code
[12:57:17] <naeluh> do you have hover intent as the event
[12:57:58] <ra1n> my code is so messy
[12:58:24] <InDigital> hi every...
[12:58:40] <jt_000_jesse> ...one
[12:58:59] <jt_000_jesse> naeluh:  where would I check that
[12:59:07] <InDigital> noo...
[12:59:11] <InDigital> every every :D
[12:59:17] <naeluh> then your selector is wrong
[12:59:23] <jt_000_jesse> :) *smiles* InDigital
[13:00:03] <basic6_> i actually tried Ladda (http://lab.hakim.se/ladda/) just now, but it throws an error undefined is not a function - anyone here used Ladda before?
[13:00:04] <naeluh> do you have the3 code
[13:00:07] <naeluh> the
[13:00:08] <jt_000_jesse> so I have all of the functions in my header.php
[13:00:31] <naeluh> yeah that does really tell me much
[13:00:38] <naeluh> doesnt
[13:00:54] <jt_000_jesse> haha It's just a basic wordpress theme, I can send you the code if you ant
[13:00:56] <jt_000_jesse> *want
[13:01:41] <naeluh> my guess is that you need to wrap your function in window.onload = function () { your code here };
[13:01:45] <jt_000_jesse> It's just that I pasted in the code from their site, into the appropriate areas, and it does not work, and unlike Winforms, I cannot debug
[13:01:59] <naeluh> what is winforms?
[13:02:16] <jt_000_jesse> windows development, like VB.NET etx
[13:02:19] <jt_000_jesse> *etc
[13:02:47] <jt_000_jesse> is there a way to debug jQuery?
[13:03:16] <grafi> jt_000_jesse so just copying the code from jqueryui didnt work for me either
[13:03:42] <jt_000_jesse> grafi: thank you for you help!  what do you think might be the problem
[13:03:46] <grafi> i had to move the .accordion() stuff below the hoverintent stuff
[13:03:50] <grafi> now it works
[13:04:01] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/cRWYy/
[13:04:32] <rmurphey> jt_000_jesse: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/part1/
[13:04:54] <rmurphey> you can absolutely debug javascript
[13:05:38] <basic6_> (nevermind, had the js files included in the wrong order)
[13:05:39] <jt_000_jesse> grafi: which code did you move?  can you tell me exactly which lines I need to move?
[13:05:45] <ra1n> everything is so much easier with dual monitors
[13:05:54] <ra1n> :(
[13:05:59] <jt_000_jesse> rmurphey: how can I debug javascript??  I didn't know it was possible
[13:06:18] <rmurphey> read up on chrome dev tools, including the js console, breakpoints, step debugging
[13:06:27] <jt_000_jesse> rmurphey: ok I see the link you sent... thank you
[13:07:37] <rmurphey> jt_000_jesse: http://www.codeschool.com/courses/discover-devtools also good
[13:07:44] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/cRWYy/1/ jt_000_jesse look there last 5 lines are above the rest on jqueryui i moved them below, which causes hoverintent to work on the jsfiddle example
[13:09:03] <rmurphey> jt_000_jesse: and this is old but good http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOEw9iiopwI
[13:09:13] <InDigital> jt_000_jesse: firebug for debugging javascript
[13:09:22] <InDigital> shows javascript errors :D
[13:10:15] <rmurphey> jt_000_jesse: last link: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[13:11:29] <jt_000_jesse> information overload whoa!  thanks everyone, I'm trying to process this all.  InDigital  yes I use Firebug and it's great, also the Firefox and Chrome inspectors are both useful
[13:12:30] <jt_000_jesse> grafi:  the darn this still won't work.  I moved the hoverintent down to the bottom, by my </script> but still the hover doesn't work
[13:13:06] <InDigital> jt_000_jesse:  what is the problem with hover?
[13:13:21] <jt_000_jesse> InDigital: when I hover, nothing happens.
[13:13:48] <jt_000_jesse> I am such a newb, so I really could be doing one million things wrong here
[13:14:08] <InDigital> hover can be written in CSS
[13:14:20] <InDigital> sometimes it wont work without !important
[13:14:51] <jt_000_jesse> InDigital: I actually know what !important is... I'll try that
[13:16:41] <jt_000_jesse> gah.. nothing yet.  I'll talk to you all later; I'm going to go watch a show
[13:16:51] <jt_000_jesse> Thank you everyone!!!

[13:46:34] <naeluh> I though thats what || or did
[13:48:10] <Ernest> no idea why the autocomplete stops working :9
[14:05:59] <mobile8> Is it possible to have a certain function only execute if screen width is more than 1000px?

[14:56:46] <Ernest> 6th being "39"
[14:56:56] <Krambiorix> anyone? when a draggable is dropped, is there anyway to get the source element?
[14:57:10] <Ernest> i thought it would be splice(6,1)
[14:58:07] <RRR2> Krambiorix: onmouseup
[14:58:29] <Krambiorix> RRR2, ?!
[14:59:06] <Krambiorix> RRR2, onmouseup get the element?
[14:59:55] <RRR2> yeah, isn't it?
[15:03:02] <huafu> Ernest: array.splice(idOfElem, 1); idOfEleme being 6-1 (5) in your case, and the 1 is because you delete one
[15:03:45] <huafu> Ernest: the index in a javascript array begins at 0
[15:04:56] <Krambiorix> RRR2, nope
[15:05:08] <RRR2> nope what?
[15:06:02] <Ernest> am just trying this splice
[15:06:14] <obert> javascript??
[15:06:24] <RRR2> Ernest: plz
[15:07:08] <Ernest> ?
[15:08:01] <RRR2> Ernest: use google for these things
[15:08:47] <Ernest> i am
[15:08:56] <Ernest> am just voicing my confusion sorry
[15:09:46] <Krambiorix> hmm i really can't find the source
[15:10:24] <Krambiorix> RRR2 you mean on start drag, get the parent id and store it somewhere?
[15:12:03] <RRR2> Krambiorix: are you using HTML5 drag?, drag element?, if the 'API' you're using for drag doesn't support adding a function for mouseup I think you gotta use your own drag function
[15:12:43] <RRR2> The mouseup, is on the document object not necessarily on the element object
[15:13:12] <pixelpimp> or dragend?
[15:13:21] <pixelpimp> might not be a mouse involved
[15:14:10] <RRR2> pixelpimp: yes, if he's using HTML5 element drag, I think.
[15:14:34] <pixelpimp> right; i'm just saying more along the lines of he hasn't given enough info
[15:14:45] <pixelpimp> many ways to accomplish the task, most of which won't work with his situation
[15:15:06] <RRR2> Krambiorix: post some code
[15:15:29] <Krambiorix> RRR2, i got it
[15:15:47] <Krambiorix> on start drag -> store parent
[15:15:53] <RRR2>  ...
[15:16:01] <RRR2> You haven't got anything
[15:17:18] <pixelpimp> sounds like a pretty bad way, but probably works.
[15:17:25] <pixelpimp> surely you have an event fired at the end.
[15:18:15] <Al1> need help with jquery + datetimepicking : http://jsfiddle.net/albertpak/q9TGc/22/Â , i got it to add an extra hour to the second input field, but how can i keep formatting same?
[15:24:09] <Al1> anyone?
[15:26:54] <jt_000_jesse> Al1:  hi I am looking for jquery help too
[15:27:03] <jt_000_jesse> al1 unfortunately I'm a noob
[15:29:30] <Al1> yeah, im trying to figure out how to do a datetimepicker range
[15:35:10] <TeddyMurray> hiya
[15:50:39] <steakofthesea> my script calls a page with ajax. the page has inline javascript in it. the script only works inside the div the ajax was called. can the script work outside the div?
[15:52:27] <Al1> need help with jquery + datetimepicking : http://jsfiddle.net/albertpak/q9TGc/22/Â , i got it to add an extra hour to the second input field, but how can i keep formatting same?
[15:53:15] <nsanden> anyone know why .done() of $.ajax wont fire? confirming the ajax page is loading with 200 response. also, tried .always() and its working
[16:47:18] <nesoi> hey doug65536_ are you around?
[16:48:24] <nesoi> or any other JQM hackers :)
[16:57:56] <doug65536_> nesoi: yes
[16:59:35] <nesoi> hey doug65536, how are you?
[16:59:44] <doug65536> pretty good
[17:00:12] <nesoi> so I'm trying to get that reverse working in the actual page where I was trying to use it, and it's not working for meâ€¦ I was wondering if you could take a look?
[17:00:55] <nesoi> I tried to put in the screen adjust code I am using, but apparently $.mobile.activePage isn't working..
[17:03:43] <doug65536> sure
[17:04:16] <nesoi> thanks!
[17:04:36] <nesoi> here's what I've gotâ€¦ it was working/not working before I put in the js code http://jsfiddle.net/gaEzu/57/
[17:04:56] <nesoi> which I took from my little app, but which doesn't seem to work here
[17:05:14] <nesoi> if you get rid of the js it displays
[17:05:27] <nesoi> not sure why that isn't working though
[17:06:30] <nesoi> the message balloons are too far left, but otherwise it looks right except for the reverse not working when applied
[17:06:35] <doug65536> $.mobile.activePage is undefined - so the browser just abandons the rest of the code
[17:06:53] <nesoi> right, but it should be defined. see this: http://jsfiddle.net/9XThY/3/
[17:07:58] <doug65536> your initialization code should be in document.ready right?
[17:08:23] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gaEzu/59/
[17:11:10] <nesoi> thanks doug65536â€¦ why does it have to be wrapped in a function?
[17:12:13] <nesoi> so this is how it looks with reverse added: http://jsfiddle.net/gaEzu/61/
[17:12:28] <nesoi> no li display
[17:14:50] <javalover> i have a layout issue & css is dead
[17:15:39] <javalover> my layout issue is this,  i formatted so that all content is centered which is great...but then I have a window frame that pops out to display more content, for seeking info on something
[17:16:03] <javalover> this window is not effected by the fact that I centered everything....so instead of being centered, it's being centered inside the center...
[17:16:08] <javalover> now* is now*
[17:16:42] <javalover> my question is this, should I make a new div outside the centered content...or is there a way to still center this element based on the window not the div it's inside
[17:17:06] <nsanden> so i have a <div data-whatever='1'> and i update it later with jquery to <div data-whatever='2'>. I see in dom it is updated. Then when i check the value of it, after that, with jquery, it is saying its the old value... i am doing these updates and checks with $('body').on('click', '#element', function(e) { } so from what i understood that should work to see dom changes
[17:18:09] <javalover> nsanden try data with more abstract like jim and bob
[17:18:29] <javalover> just to see if it's really checking the value & not whether data exist
[17:18:53] <nsanden> 1 is just an example, its really a unix timestamp
[17:18:59] <javalover> oh okay well in that case
[17:19:09] <javalover> wait is it getting timestamp in real time?
[17:19:25] <nsanden> from ajax
[17:19:28] <javalover> okay then
[17:19:30] <javalover> theres your issue
[17:19:31] <doug65536> nesoi: that delays it until the document is ready
[17:19:44] <javalover> you're checking a timestamp
[17:19:50] <doug65536> nesoi: hold on, helping sister with major computer issue. will be afk for a bit
[17:19:52] <javalover> the time it takes to display is different from when it grabs it
[17:19:52] <nsanden> sorry not ajax
[17:19:53] <nesoi> oic
[17:19:59] <nesoi> np, thanks doug65536
[17:19:59] <nsanden> ajax updates the data-whatever
[17:20:07] <nsanden> and then next click, i check data-whatever
[17:20:11] <javalover> are you sure it updates
[17:20:16] <nsanden> yes, i check the dom
[17:20:20] <nsanden> firebug
[17:20:22] <javalover> but ti's  atimestamp
[17:20:24] <javalover> try doing this
[17:20:29] <javalover> don't change based on timestamp
[17:20:38] <javalover> force it to a new value you predetermine
[17:20:40] <javalover> then see if it works
[17:20:45] <nsanden> i tried that as well
[17:20:48] <javalover> same bug?
[17:20:50] <nsanden> tried just doing test2
[17:20:52] <nsanden> yes
[17:21:03] <javalover> what's the exact result you're getting?
[17:21:11] <javalover> does it just not activate a function?
[17:21:26] <javalover> like ur doing check & it's not going through?
[17:21:36] <nsanden> well for example, if my <div data-whatever='test1'> and i update it to 'test2', then i check the value it is still test1
[17:21:53] <nsanden> my check activates
[17:21:54] <javalover> can you show me how you update
[17:22:08] <javalover> just that line of code will help
[17:22:32] <nsanden> $('#whatever').attr('data-timestamp', ps.mytimestamp);
[17:22:52] <nsanden> but like i said, i tried 'test2' instead of ps.mytimestamp
[17:23:01] <javalover> hold on   lemme lookthat up
[17:23:08] <nsanden> it updates it fine
[17:23:43] <nsanden> i tried $('#whatever').data('timestamp', 'test2') but that was not updating it at all
[17:24:25] <javalover> no
[17:24:32] <javalover> i don't think it's .data
[17:24:38] <javalover> it is .attr
[17:24:42] <javalover> but the thing is
[17:24:49] <javalover> on doc they just put a vlue
[17:24:54] <javalover> don't do data-timestamp
[17:24:56] <javalover> just do timestamp
[17:25:14] <javalover> $('#whatever').attr('timestamp', ps.mytimestamp);
[17:25:19] <nsanden> realy
[17:25:24] <nsanden> ill try
[17:25:25] <rmurphey> why not do a data- attribute?
[17:25:32] <javalover> idk his thing won't work
[17:25:37] <javalover> but the doc shows it without it
[17:25:43] <javalover> http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[17:25:48] <javalover> i'm just basing it on the doc
[17:26:06] <javalover> as a coder I disagree with my own statement, but as a jquery coder...do everything based on doc
[17:26:14] <rmurphey> well, .attr will get any attribute
[17:26:25] <rmurphey> so .attr('data-timestamp') should get the data-timestamp attr ...
[17:26:39] <javalover> apparently that's what doc says
[17:26:56] <javalover> this is as if it's implied & say he's checking the value same way
[17:27:04] <javalover> perhaps the value doesn't exist if he inputs it wrong
[17:28:20] <javalover> hmm interesting things i'm reading
[17:28:46] <javalover> okay so say he was doing .attr  & also doing .data
[17:29:03] <RRR2> I don't understand jQuery doc at all
[17:29:25] <javalover> .attr relates to things written in the html so <height="5" width="10">   those are .attr    but .data referes to literally the data attribute so data = "stuff";
[17:29:40] <javalover> so maybe what he should be doing is not .attr  but only .data
[17:29:53] <javalover> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:29:54] <shoky> .data only fetches the data-xxx attributes, one time
[17:30:02] <javalover> listen to shoky
[17:30:04] <shoky> it doesn't write to any attribute, ever
[17:30:08] <javalover> as i'm a noob please everyone listen to shoky
[17:30:13] <rmurphey> so, .data('timestamp') will return the value of the data-timestamp attr if it's set
[17:30:34] <rmurphey> but, what shoky said, it's not for writing
[17:30:45] <rmurphey> well, not for writing attribures
[17:30:48] <rmurphey> attributes
[17:30:53] <javalover> right,
[17:31:07] <javalover> and that could be his problem, in trying to call it with .attr
[17:31:11] <nsanden> ok so $('#whatever').attr('timestamp', ps.mytimestamp); is not updating dom
[17:31:12] <javalover> instead of just .data
[17:31:21] <javalover> sanden we've been talking while you were gone
[17:31:29] <rmurphey> nsanden: do you have a demo?
[17:31:30] <javalover> my advice is listen to shoky
[17:31:33] <nsanden> so now i am going to try $('#whatever').data('timestamp', ps.mytimestamp); again
[17:31:45] <javalover> yes and try not to mix them
[17:31:50] <javalover> only use .data
[17:32:05] <rmurphey> ... unless you're trying to read and write attributes on the element itself
[17:32:21] <rmurphey> if you're just trying to store data on the element, use data
[17:32:24] <nsanden> i think it may be working now... odd
[17:32:33] <javalover> cuz you were tryign to make na attribute
[17:32:38] <javalover> using .attr on .data
[17:32:49] <javalover> but that's not how .data works, shoky understands this more than I do
[17:33:11] <javalover> <shoky> .data only fetches the data-xxx attributes, one time
[17:33:18] <javalover> <shoky> it doesn't write to any attribute, ever
[17:34:10] <nsanden> yes its working!
[17:34:25] <nsanden> i dont see where i was using both attr and data though
[17:34:30] <nsanden> but maybe i was
[17:34:31] <nsanden> at one time
[17:34:51] <nsanden> but in any case than you both very much
[17:35:41] <javalover> you're most welcome, thank you for fixing your bug :-)
[17:35:53] <RRR2> I didnt know attributes were Nodes..
[17:36:10] <shoky> they're not
[17:36:29] <shoky> elements are, tho
[17:36:48] <RRR2> they aren't?
[17:37:09] <shoky> if you mean a DOM node, then no they aren't
[17:38:49] <RRR2> The prototype of the Attr object is a Node Object
[17:39:05] <shoky> what's an Attr object?
[17:39:15] <RRR2> an attribute
[17:39:44] <RRR2> for example... document.body.attributes[0]
[17:39:48] <shoky> Warning: In DOM Core 1, 2 and 3, Attr inherited from Node. This is no longer the case in DOM4. In order to bring the implementation of Attr up to specification, work is underway to change it to no longer inherit from Node. You should not be using any Node properties or methods on Attr objects.
[17:39:52] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attr
[17:40:16] <shoky> weird shit
[17:40:16] <RRR2> Oh
[17:40:31] <RRR2> So it's just fallback support
[17:40:36] <RRR2> I understand
[17:40:41] <shoky> i suppose. had no idea about that
[17:41:23] <nsanden> so strange... checking firebug data-whatever is not updated, but using jquery to check it, it is updated. is that to be expected?
[17:42:02] <shoky> nsanden: yes, if you changed the data with .data()
[17:42:22] <shoky> .data() doesn't write to the attributes. it writes to jquery's internal data cache
[17:43:12] <nsanden> ah
[17:46:22] <nsanden> and the problems keep getting wierder
[17:50:04] <nsanden> i pass my timestamp to a date formatting plugin. possible the plugin caches the old value?
[17:50:22] <rmurphey> nsanden: do you have a fiddle or jsbin showing your code?
[17:50:41] <nsanden> no i dont, id have to strip it down a lot
[17:50:55] <rmurphey> and stripping it down a lot might help you solve your problems :)
[17:51:32] <rmurphey> i'd recommend either usng attributes or using jquery's data cache
[17:51:34] <rmurphey> one or the other
[17:51:41] <nsanden> yes i am doing that now
[17:51:50] <nsanden> its giving me the correct value every time onclick
[17:51:52] <rmurphey> and then i'd recommend ensuring that the value you are passing to your plugin is the value you expect to be passing to the plugin
[17:52:04] <nsanden> problem is i send that to timezoneJS.Date()
[17:52:11] <nsanden> and its seeing my very first value always
[17:52:27] <rmurphey> without a demo of the problem it is going to be difficult for people to help
[17:52:36] <nsanden> sure
[17:52:38] <RRR2> shoky: jQuery writes a number to the DOM element can that be done with any element?
[18:12:48] <shoky> RRR2: what do you mean?
[18:13:41] <RRR2> the DOM element is added an attribute, like jQuery+"Random numbers here"
[18:25:23] <Ernest> hlello anyone still around?
[18:36:26] <nsanden> ...
[18:36:56] <nsanden> i just love spending an hour debugging something to find its as simple as using a string in a function that expects int
[18:37:28] <nsanden> need someone to smack me
[18:38:11] <RRR2> but this is jQuery
[18:38:59] <nesoi> why isn't there a nice error message that pops out on the console "expected string, saw integer"? etc
[18:39:25] <RRR2> Well, uhh because javascript isn't strong typed?
[18:39:55] <RRR2> if the function expects an int, and if you wrote that function you can make it throw a TypeError
[18:39:56] <nsanden> well the function could check it no?
[18:39:59] <garbagecollectio> can i use jquery to set an -ms-filter alpha load propert
[18:40:19] <nsanden> try it
[18:43:18] <RRR2> JSfiddle doesn't allow document.write?!
[18:44:39] <Ernest> can i have some advice
[18:44:50] <Ernest>  am trying to work something out but i think my logic is failing
[18:45:12] <RRR2> Ernest: Yes, you can try a flowchart
[18:45:19] <Ernest> :s
[18:45:29] <RRR2> Ernest: you're welcome
[18:45:37] <duckgoose> Well :0
[18:46:00] <Ernest> when i click a button nested in a <li>
[18:46:29] <Ernest> hold on let me try something
[18:46:48] <grafi> oÃ´
[18:46:58] <duckgoose> you'll figure it out after all the trouble of coming here
[18:47:01] <grafi> oh look a squirrel
[18:47:22] <Ernest> $("#favList li .delurl").click(function (e) {
[18:47:30] <Ernest> i am trying to make the click on the .delurl class
[18:47:32] <duckgoose> grafi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDPkyBCVWsQ
[18:47:43] <Ernest> then access the li index
[18:47:49] <Ernest> of that list item
[18:48:27] <grafi> duckgoose he escaped though
[18:48:28] <grafi> ^^
[18:48:45] <grafi> and then Ernest?
[18:49:03] <Ernest> it deletes the item from localstorage
[18:49:08] <Ernest> i have the localstorage part working
[18:49:32] <Ernest> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/121
[18:49:32] <Ernest> so far
[18:50:00] <Ernest> it adds to favourites ok :)
[18:50:17] <Ernest> but am trying to get the delete favourite button to work
[18:50:45] <Ernest> so am trying to get the li index() and splice the array and store it back in the local storage
[18:52:59] <duckgoose> so
[18:53:19] <duckgoose> when the button is pressed you want to get the <li> the button pressed is in?
[18:53:28] <Ernest> the index of it
[18:53:38] <Ernest> so i can use that value in the splice(x,1)
[18:53:58] <Ernest> normally i would do $('#favList li').index();
[18:54:47] <doug65536> RRR2: if you want to force jsfiddle to allow it (at your own risk), use document["write"]("foo")
[18:55:26] <doug65536> RRR2: it only makes sense to do that to a popup window or if the script section is in body (option at top left)
[18:55:47] <doug65536> RRR2: it could make sense in head too
[18:55:48] <RRR2> doug65536: hah, brilliant
[18:56:02] <RRR2> doug65536: I used document.open() anyway
[19:01:08] <Ernest> how can i find the index value of a li on the click of a button
[19:03:01] <doug65536> Ernest: make your event handler take a parameter called 'event', and use $(event.target).index()
[19:03:29] <doug65536> Ernest: but it depends on whether you are binding to a parent, etc
[19:03:39] <Ernest> ok am confused
[19:03:50] <Ernest> am trying to find something similiar online so i can understand
[19:04:01] <Ernest> i have a function for the li click
[19:04:21] <Ernest> but i now am creating one for a button in the <li> it is a split list item
[19:04:27] <doug65536> Ernest: the click is on the li itself>
[19:04:29] <doug65536> ?
[19:04:32] <Ernest> no
[19:04:39] <Ernest> a button
[19:04:55] <doug65536> your fiddle is big, hard to know what you're talking about
[19:05:10] <Ernest> which number are you looking at
[19:05:58] <Ernest> $('#favourites').on
[19:06:02] <Ernest> is the start of the favourites page
[19:13:44] <duckgoose> do you have a click fucntion for the li you want the index of
[19:14:29] <Ernest> yes that function takes you to the shop page
[19:14:49] <Ernest> on the jsfiddle, click the li
[19:14:56] <Ernest> and then the add to fav in top right corner
[19:15:04] <Ernest> you will then see the split list
[19:16:13] <duckgoose> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1633205/getting-the-index-of-a-list-item-with-jquery perhaps this will help you
[19:16:30] <Ernest> let me have a read thx
[19:18:52] <duckgoose> $("#someul li").click(function () { var index = $("#someul li").index(this); })
[19:19:13] <duckgoose> maybe...
[19:21:03] <Ernest> am trying to click #favList li .delUrl
[19:21:15] <Ernest> and get the #favList li index()
[19:21:21] <Al1> looking at the console and i get "Unexpected string" - http://jsfiddle.net/albertpak/q9TGc/2/ - why?
[19:23:50] <Al1> my bad, this is the updated one: http://jsfiddle.net/albertpak/q9TGc/34/
[19:24:00] <Ernest> $("#favList li .delurl").click(function (e) {
[19:24:05] <Ernest> that is my selector
[19:24:23] <Ernest> but obviously this (this) does not work as expected for me
[19:27:10] <duckgoose> I can't find what you're talking about in that example, Ernest
[19:27:14] <pixelpimp> $(this) will be your .delurl; you want the parent?
[19:28:24] <Ernest> the li yeah
[19:28:29] <Ernest> its not direct parent i dont think
[19:28:31] <pixelpimp> .parent()
[19:28:35] <Ernest> as jquery adds loads of shit
[19:28:39] <Ernest> jquery mobile
[19:30:03] <pixelpimp> .parents('li') i think should suffice there, then
[19:30:28] <pixelpimp> although may return multiple results
[19:30:39] <Ernest> 			var numItem = $('this').parents('li').index();
[19:30:48] <Ernest> tried that and parent()
[19:31:28] <Ernest> wat example number duckgoose?
[19:31:37] <pixelpimp> there is also .closest('li')
[19:33:15] <Ernest> i think parent() has solved it
[19:33:16] <Ernest> thx
[19:33:17] <Ernest> :D

[20:00:59] <Orxata_> hi
[20:15:26] <duckgoose> hello, Orxata_
[20:17:39] <dbcclarke> Does anyone know why my simple code is not producing the simple jqPLOT graph one my webpage? code -> http://pastie.org/private/7lukkwk3hmsxgroieb7ea what is shown -> http://grab.by/pgIi
[20:17:47] <dbcclarke> on*
[20:18:11] <dbcclarke> I want the jqPLOT to show above the "Chart goes here"
[20:35:22] <fr0ggie> I need something like a simple desktop. My site has lots of php pages that output blobs of incomplete HTML, for embedding into other stuff. Now i want to make a desktop. Something that'd really rock would be having the window decorations disappear when the mouse goes off the window, so to save even more screen real estate. Any good starting points? open source, preferably MIT-ish licensed projects out there doing it already?
[20:37:47] <feathersanddown> Hi, need to ask something about a jquery pluggin, can I ask here ?
[20:38:13] <dbcclarke> I need to ask something about a jqPLOT, can I ask here?

[20:40:27] <shoky> `ask
[20:40:28] <tw2113> and i'm asking here whether i can or not
[20:40:29] <b-ot> shoky: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[20:40:45] <tw2113> i don't care what shoky says about me to my face
[20:40:53] * shoky flamethrower tw2113
[20:41:05] <tw2113> further proving i'm hot stuff
[20:41:14] * shoky slaps tw2113 around a bit with a wakeboard
[20:41:34] <tw2113> i got nothing witty for that one
[20:41:35] <feathersanddown> anyway.........  I'm using fullcalendar, need to avoid events overlap
[20:41:47] <shoky> heehee
[20:49:17] <LLckfan> I am trying to rreconnect my blu-ray player to my routeers wifi and I am getting DHCP cannot be acquired. I have checked the routers settings and DHCP is enabled. Is there a way to fix this?
[20:50:29] <feathersanddown> LLckfan: offtopic.......  but have you checked how many ip's router can assign ?
[20:50:40] <LLckfan> 49
[20:50:52] <feathersanddown> and are all used?
[20:51:16] <LLckfan> nope
[20:52:27] <feathersanddown> maybe in #networking can help you
[20:52:42] <LLckfan> They never have tried
[20:52:44] <pixelpimp> wat
[20:52:47] <LLckfan> Then they baned me
[20:52:49] <pixelpimp> why is this in jquery?
[20:53:21] <pixelpimp> try one of the sex channels, i hear they do a lot of network troubleshooting
[20:57:25] <feathersanddown> pixelpimp: very rude
[20:59:13] <pixelpimp> as is asking a question like that in a channel like this, and to be fair, all the girls in those channels are 40-year-old networking experts ;)

[21:37:00] <k_sze[work]> The documentation says that "the .html() method is not available in XML documents". That doesn't include XHTML strict files, right?
[22:06:54] * tw2113 runs up and hugs shoky just to make him feel uncomfortable
[22:49:48] <sacrilicious> hello
[22:49:59] <sacrilicious> how do i test if jquery is loaded ?
[22:50:34] <sacrilicious> i get this error Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function
[22:56:33] <sacrilicious> heloooooo
[22:59:33] <Phlow> check if jQuery exists
[22:59:50] <sacrilicious> it is there
[22:59:55] <sacrilicious> it is loaded
[23:00:13] <sacrilicious> but i still get this message "Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function"
[23:02:09] <Phlow> Are you or some other js putting jquery into no conflict mode?
[23:02:22] <sacrilicious> nevermind, i used the no conflict mode
[23:02:24] <sacrilicious> of jquery
[23:02:44] <sacrilicious> thanks though
[23:41:43] <lemonsparrow> hi all
[23:53:04] <DarsVaeda> if I select of elements and bind an event handler to each of them, can I know which one (number) of them in the set triggers an event?
[23:53:27] <DarsVaeda> if I select a set of elements (sorry)
[23:54:59] <amirite> my head is going to implode
[23:55:33] <amirite> console.debug(event.type)
[23:55:34] <Cork> DarsVaeda: no, the set is used to loop over the element to bind the listeners
[23:55:45] <Cork> the info isn't keept for when they are triggered
[23:56:06] <amirite> liar
[23:56:10] <DarsVaeda> what I want to do is: select a number of links bind click events on them and due to the number use the :nth-child() selector to display and hide other elements
[23:56:47] <Cork> DarsVaeda: you could store the set, and then use index(this) to get the index
[23:56:48] <DarsVaeda> that way I would not have to give each of them an id
[23:57:12] <DarsVaeda> okay I'll try that thanks
[23:57:28] <Cork> var set = $('a.something'); set.on('click', function() { set.index(this) });
[23:58:48] <DarsVaeda> works like a charm :)
[23:58:51] <DarsVaeda> thanks
