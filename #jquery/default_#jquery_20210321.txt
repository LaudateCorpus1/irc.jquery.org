[18:51:10] <johntalent> does jquery work with polyline?
[18:51:43] <johntalent> nevermind got it working.
[18:51:43] <robertmaxrees> jquery and svg generally don't mix.
[18:51:59] <robertmaxrees> you might be able to get things to work a bit, but i'd avoid it.
[19:01:18] <johntalent> it works, but not well. sometimes it just refuses to work depending on the value!
[20:52:29] <robertmaxrees> johntalent sure, some things might work, but i would seriously avoid it anyway.  you'll just run into headaches :)
