[00:24:06] <WhirledPress> Anybody know how to handle scrolling past the end of a series of elements so that the first element appears seamlessly after the last element?
[00:24:49] <WhirledPress> rather than forcing the user to watch the content scroll backwards through the list to the first element
[00:25:54] <raj> can these links be reliably used as a cdn? https://code.jquery.com/
[00:26:40] <ExoUNX> raj, yes
[00:38:14] <impliednude> slideToggle starts open. I have tried to keep it closed by declaring display:none on the attribute. but it doesn't open at all then.
[00:38:27] <impliednude> please assist
[00:38:40] <WhirledPress> wheres your code? jsfiddle, codepen?
[00:43:34] <impliednude> nevermind. I realized why. Thanks!!!
[00:46:33] <WhirledPress> circular scrolling? anyone?
[01:14:19] <raj> thanks ExoUNX
[01:43:47] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/0d4qufnu/ - I don't know js very much. I am trying to figure out how to apply if ($('#DivToSlide').is(':visible')) to close that slide.. Any help appreciated.
[02:05:25] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/0d4qufnu/1/ - why does this not work?
[02:22:13] <Cork> impliednude: your line 8 and 15 is invalid
[05:24:36] <__hassoon__> 'morning
[05:25:23] <__hassoon__> anyone knows of some jquery multiple file upload plugin, that has the drag 'n drop feature as well as thumbnaling image files, and not requiring ajax ?
[05:26:12] <__hassoon__> not requiring ajax meaning just letting the server receive the multiple list of files within the current POST form
[05:26:18] <__hassoon__> dunno i'm searching already
[05:42:30] <itsgokul> which plugin is good for creating charts
[06:10:55] <itsgokul> which library uses $.plot
[09:06:26] <WhirledPress> hey all. I was wondering how you can find a coordinate to move an element to if you have both pixels and viewheight units.
[09:35:22] <Cork> WhirledPress: what exactly are you asking?
[09:35:42] <Cork> if you want to move an element to a coordinate just move it there
[09:35:54] <Cork> or is there some more constraints to that question?
[10:20:13] <Es0teric> i want to recursively move a couple of divs from one div to another... how would i go about doing that?
[10:20:40] <Cork> Es0teric: $('the-divs').appendTo('other-div')
[10:20:56] <Cork> or $('other-div').append('the-divs')
[10:21:20] <Cork> no need to remove them from the original place or anything like that
[10:21:21] <Es0teric> i have that
[10:22:23] <Es0teric> Cork this is what it looks like: https://puu.sh/vvJmG/66efaed505.png
[10:22:41] <Cork> i can't debug an image...
[10:22:42] <Es0teric> it just adds multiples of the same ones... $('.button.acomment-reply').appendTo($( '.comment-reply' ));
[10:23:05] <Cork> make a jsfiddle if you need help with an exact problem
[10:23:23] <Es0teric> Cork idk how to replicate that
[10:27:35] <Es0teric> Cork if you were to guess as to why its duplicating like that based off what i just told you i had that i was calling... what do you think the problem might be?
[10:27:56] <Cork> i have no clue, i can't even tell what is happening
[10:28:05] <Cork> cause; it is just an image
[10:28:21] <Cork> it could be the css size changes to the background image repeats or what ever
[10:29:06] <Cork> *so the
[10:29:45] <Cork> if you want to get help you need to provide a dom with the problem, else there isn't anything i can do
[10:46:33] <FilipNortic> Es0teric: have you tried checking the values of the slectors manualy. Cause when you get errors like this. The "usal" error is not that you're using a function wrong but that the selectors isn't returning what you think they are
[10:55:51] <Es0teric> FilipNortic did you see the image?
[10:56:51] <FilipNortic> I did and if you appendTo a selector that gets more then 1 elemant that would be one explanation
[10:58:09] <Es0teric> so should i just do an each?
[10:58:12] <Es0teric> or a .filter()
[10:59:26] <Cork> FilipNortic: no that isn't correct
[10:59:34] <Cork> if you append html that would be true
[10:59:40] <Cork> but dom elements doesn't clone them self
[10:59:49] <Cork> so they will only append to the last position
[11:01:15] <FilipNortic> ahh right. so to get that error you need to do something in some sort of loop then.
[11:01:32] <Cork> well no you have to either select multiple sources
[11:01:37] <Cork> or generate from html
[11:01:48] <Cork> or do a clone somewhere
[11:02:22] <Cork> but again we can guess here all day based on an image, but we can't help before we get to see the problem
[11:02:42] <Cork> (and that requires the dom and the js doing it)
[11:06:13] <GoSox> i can never remember how to do this, how can i bind an event (.mouseup( ) in this case) to elements that don't exist yet when the page is loaded?
[11:07:11] <FilipNortic> GoSox: you bind it to the closest parrent that exists on page load
[11:08:30] <FilipNortic> but that will be $("#parrent").on("mouseup", "newElement", function(){...})
[11:10:04] <FilipNortic> GoSox: a less simple way is to bind the handler when you introduce the element but that usally a backwards approch
[11:10:11] <GoSox> FilipNortic: so the "newElement" in that statement, I assume I can toss in a classname? And it will search for all of those classes within the parent?
[11:11:19] <FilipNortic> anySelector is fine but if it's not a decendent of the "#parent" then it won't trigger
[11:11:28] <FilipNortic> any selector*
[11:11:35] <Cork> GoSox: http://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data-handler
[11:19:50] <GoSox> great thats all working, but now i have a new problem. $(this) doesn't work inside of the callback function of an animation. im assuming this is a scope thing. theres no unique id or class i can use to reference the item i'm trying to first hide with animation, then once that animation is done, delete
[11:20:07] <GoSox> i suspect theres a way of doing this i'm overlooking
[11:23:47] <GoSox> hah i was hoping i could just add a variable pointing to $(this) as an argument to the callback function, but that doesn't seem to work
[11:27:58] <Es0teric> AH HA! Cork https://jsfiddle.net/duc8zuzc/1/
[11:28:01] <Es0teric> its happening in the fiddle
[11:28:14] <Es0teric> reply is displaying 3x
[11:28:17] <Es0teric> on each div
[11:29:53] <GoSox> ok the problem i was just having is not at all the problem i thought i was having
[11:33:19] <Es0teric> FilipNortic https://jsfiddle.net/duc8zuzc/1/
[11:43:25] <Es0teric> anybody?
[11:43:42] <Es0teric> is anyone going to help me with my code here?
[11:51:36] <Uhkis> Es0teric: what's your problem?
[11:52:39] <Es0teric> Uhkis well on my fiddle ( https://jsfiddle.net/duc8zuzc/1/ ) basically the reply div keeps repeating when its moved for some reason
[11:55:40] <Uhkis> Es0teric: your problem is that there's 3 of those
[11:55:49] <Es0teric> yes
[11:55:53] <Es0teric> but its supposed to be one each
[11:55:56] <Es0teric> on appendTo
[11:57:13] <Es0teric> Uhkis
[11:57:51] <Uhkis> yes, but your selector has 3 items so they're all appended
[11:58:39] <Es0teric> Uhkis so how do i fix it?
[12:02:19] <Es0teric> o.O
[12:03:05] <Uhkis> Es0teric: https://jsfiddle.net/duc8zuzc/2/ something like that
[12:05:06] <Es0teric> Uhkis ohhh i see... you're appending as long as the item is relative to the parent right?
[12:05:21] <Es0teric> thats how you ensure that you only get one
[12:06:09] <Uhkis> yes
[12:07:44] <Es0teric> hmm i'll play around with it then
[12:31:08] <GoSox> I'm a little confused. Once i'm in the callback function of a $.post( ) request, what does $(this) become?
[12:31:20] <robertmaxrees> the $.post() call itself.
[12:31:26] <GoSox> it is clearly no longer the element i clicked on to start the process
[12:31:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah - gotta hand it that directly.
[12:32:06] <robertmaxrees> couple ways to accomplish that.
[12:32:52] <robertmaxrees> you can use .bind() on the function to change the "this" value to what you want.  or you can just var $theElement = $(this); and then use $theElement in there instead.
[12:32:53] <GoSox> there are no unique identifiers on the items i'm manupilating, other than the fact that they are what i clicked on
[12:33:15] <GoSox> i tried your second method and it didn't work
[12:33:21] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me?
[12:33:41] <GoSox> well its gone, but i did what you said but without the 'var' in front of the declaration
[12:33:59] <robertmaxrees> did you declare that var inside of the callback itself?
[12:34:51] <GoSox> no
[12:35:00] <robertmaxrees> then I'd have to see what you did.
[12:35:13] <robertmaxrees> because that works heh
[12:35:18] <GoSox> ok hold on then
[12:36:05] <GoSox> i don't remember exactly what i did, but lets just recreate it :D
[12:36:06] <GoSox> https://jsfiddle.net/209grd3k/
[12:36:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so your 'this' keeps changing there.  also: use var.
[12:36:41] <GoSox> so if i declare $myvar = $(this) after line 3, then I can use $myvar after line 5 to referr to the item i clicked
[12:36:58] <robertmaxrees> after line 2.
[12:37:35] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/2f1034501cae
[12:37:40] <robertmaxrees> these are your options.
[12:37:56] <GoSox> ok lemme see if this works
[12:38:06] <GoSox> this is what i did i believe, but i didn't use var
[12:38:13] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[12:38:14] <GoSox> javascript scope is very confusing to me
[12:38:25] <robertmaxrees> it's not that hard to understand.
[12:39:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5pq8g6q9/5/
[12:39:16] <robertmaxrees> this shows you the ideas.
[12:39:57] <GoSox> yeah that is hard to undersatnd
[12:40:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:40:05] <robertmaxrees> lemme simplify it then.
[12:40:23] <GoSox> this is easy to understand: http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php
[12:40:29] <GoSox> but anyway this is offtopic
[12:40:30] <GoSox> testing now...
[12:40:36] <robertmaxrees> not offtopic at all heh
[12:40:37] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[12:41:38] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/da35ah99/
[12:41:46] <robertmaxrees> for a super-simplified version.
[12:42:47] <robertmaxrees> and https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/209grd3k/1/ for a slightly cleaner version of your code.
[12:43:35] <GoSox> well, clean intendation is in the eye of the beholder :)
[12:43:41] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:43:44] <robertmaxrees> not just indentation.
[12:43:46] <robertmaxrees> uses vars, too.
[12:44:00] <robertmaxrees> instead of doing the same dom traversal over and over.
[12:44:55] <GoSox> well actually, the $this on line 9 is wrong, as that is supposed to be the newly-scoped $(this)
[12:45:18] <robertmaxrees> so you want it to be the row_id ?
[12:45:21] <GoSox> but yeah once i get it to work, then ill clean it and possibly merge it with a few almost identical event handlers
[12:45:59] <robertmaxrees> err,t he row that you get the ID from?
[12:46:21] <robertmaxrees> because for that I'd do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/209grd3k/2/
[12:47:48] <Kartagis> I give up, I have to ask you guys
[12:47:54] <Kartagis> ahoy first
[12:48:57] <robertmaxrees> sup
[12:49:26] <Kartagis> I have several lines in a table and several cells on each line. cells have no classes or ids. how do I colorise this td based on its text?
[12:50:02] <robertmaxrees> gross.
[12:50:51] <GoSox> what does "based on its text" mean exactly?
[12:50:59] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis before you go down that road, why not give them classes server-side?
[12:51:31] <Kartagis> I can't, the CMS I'm using didn't allow that
[12:51:42] <robertmaxrees> then use .filter() with a function.
[12:52:22] <robertmaxrees> body of the function does something like returnn $(this).text().indexOf('something') > -1;
[12:52:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ctvbxfL7/1/
[12:53:02] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis ^
[12:54:48] <GoSox> woohooo it all seems to be working! i wish i didn't spend 4 hours making a fancy admin panel that only i'm going to use. but all this work will lead to a site that is managed with less reaction time and thats a good thing
[12:55:04] <robertmaxrees> always a good thing GoSox
[12:55:12] <robertmaxrees> did that fiddle about scope help clarify for you?
[12:55:22] <robertmaxrees> it's a really important topic to understand.
[12:55:49] <GoSox> honestly, not really. i mean i've read many documents on javascript variable scope before but i still find it kind of voodoo-ey compared to variable scope in php
[12:56:00] <robertmaxrees> it's not voodoo-ey at all.
[12:56:18] <robertmaxrees> it's all about where the function was declared.
[12:56:36] <robertmaxrees> also: leaving the var keyword off is a really bad idea.
[12:56:55] <GoSox> why? what id the difference between using var and not using var?
[12:57:39] <robertmaxrees> not using var is technically invalid but browsers allow you to get away with it for heritage reasons.
[12:57:44] <robertmaxrees> it makes every variable global.
[12:58:37] <robertmaxrees> which seems innocent enough until you start using stuff like $this = $(this); in your code and then randomly $this is things you don't expect it to be because of race conditions.
[13:02:03] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: thanks, but why doesn't it work with this? https://jsfiddle.net/1L07nfge/
[13:03:09] <GoSox> no <table> tag for your table?
[13:03:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:03:34] <robertmaxrees> that'll fix it ;)
[13:04:53] <Uhkis> is it just me or is addClass with css-animations really buggy?
[13:05:04] <robertmaxrees> buggy how?
[13:05:11] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/1L07nfge/1/
[13:05:23] <Kartagis> wee
[13:05:28] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis ;)
[13:05:29] <Kartagis> thanks a lot
[13:05:59] <GoSox> Kartagis: also you can do "every other #" in css easy enough without needing "even" and "odd" classes
[13:06:09] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: need a second to make a fiddle, but seems it just sometimes works with the transition and sometimes dont, depending on what calls it
[13:06:28] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis huh?  should be fine.
[13:06:44] <Kartagis> GoSox: I don't know where those words are
[13:07:06] <Kartagis> could be on 1st row, 3rd row, anywhere
[13:13:52] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/vemvyaew/ no animation
[13:14:45] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/vemvyaew/2/ animation just fine
[13:18:17] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:18:57] <robertmaxrees> it's not a jquery issue fwiw.
[13:19:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vemvyaew/3/
[13:19:37] <robertmaxrees> looks like a weird reflow issue.
[13:20:52] <Uhkis> tackled with similar weirdness with this https://uhkis.net/drop/css/ there's 2 wtf-moments in the code
[13:21:09] <Uhkis> #88 and #101
[13:21:55] <robertmaxrees> sec
[13:22:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vemvyaew/4/
[13:22:38] <robertmaxrees> check this out.
[13:22:59] <robertmaxrees> iirc the browser does some weird optimizations for stuff like this.
[13:23:56] <Uhkis> no animation there either
[13:24:02] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:24:16] <robertmaxrees> but then do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vemvyaew/6/
[13:24:34] <robertmaxrees> it has to do with how the rendering engine works iirc.
[13:24:46] <Uhkis> yeah.. weird "wait a sec" :D
[13:24:58] <robertmaxrees> http://www.christianheilmann.com/2015/08/30/quicky-fading-in-a-newly-created-element-using-css/
[13:32:43] <Uhkis> thanks!
[14:21:33] <sine0> I have read that jqueryvalidation.org is only compatable with older versions of jquery, so does that hold you back if you want to utilise functions of a newer version of jquery and also use this validation plugin ?
[14:22:28] <robertmaxrees> sine0 where'd you read that?
[14:23:29] <sine0> probably from an illinformed blogpost, are you saying its fine with the latest version? if so ill crack on
[14:23:54] <robertmaxrees> the homepage says it's compatible with 3.1.1
[14:24:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryvalidation.org
[14:24:21] <robertmaxrees> specifically https://jqueryvalidation.org/#required
[14:25:11] <sine0> ok cool, my bad at reading skills.
[14:25:16] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :)
[14:26:11] <Uhkis> animationend event does not fire properly, darn
[14:27:15] <Uhkis> http://uhkis.rocks/ works nicely if you dont touch the browser

[14:28:01] <Uhkis> taplar: no 's in the url! :D
[14:29:01] <taplar> jazzy
[14:29:38] <taplar> but i feel like you should make it continually grow, and insert a new small one after a point so it seems like it loops forever, :D
[14:38:34] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeee
[14:42:21] <Uhkis> taplar: if only animationiteration would give progress
[16:38:10] <WebDragon> https://hastebin.com/bipomebula.lisp  so I have these two datepicker fields, and they do this lovely thing where it sets minmax after clicking a date based on the opposite field's choices
[16:38:54] <WebDragon> BUT on reloading the Wordpress Custom Post Type, when it pre-fills the fields with metadata from the database for the existing post, it fails to maintain the visual minmax appearance you would get after you clicked
[16:39:05] <WebDragon> is there a way I can ensure that happens either way?
[16:40:47] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon what does "on reloading the Wordpress Custom Post Type" mean?
[16:40:50] <robertmaxrees> that an ajax thing or...?
[16:40:59] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: I
[16:41:01] <WebDragon> derp
[16:41:34] <WebDragon> I am building a wordpress plugin that uses the datepicker from jquery-ui to add start/stop dates for a featured entree for this restaurant website I'm doing some work on
[16:41:50] <Stragler> Hello. I have a $.get that fetches some HTML from the backend and then inserts it into a <div></div> through the callback. This newly inserted HTML has a tag with an id, however I am not able to reach the id through jQuery after the ajax request. Been trying to access it and just console.log something but its not working. Any suggestions?
[16:42:01] <WebDragon> a custom post type lets me add entrees that are independent of the theme, so that if I change themes, I don't have to recreate all the code in the theme
[16:42:08] <WebDragon> separation of concerns
[16:42:16] <robertmaxrees> right so like...
[16:42:19] <WebDragon> this is, however specific to jquery/jquery-ui
[16:42:19] <taplar_> Stragler: define "after the ajax request"
[16:42:31] <robertmaxrees> you just want to set the datepicker stuff, right WebDragon?
[16:42:55] <WebDragon> when you have an existing field already populated with a value, I want the minmax to be reflected the same way as it would be if I clicked a date and close the field and click on the other one
[16:43:13] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon then yeah, i'd look at the setter options in the api docs.
[16:43:15] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: correct, but a bit more specific than just that
[16:43:15] <robertmaxrees> that may fix it.
[16:43:32] <robertmaxrees> Stragler are you console logging in the success callback of the ajax call or just after the call itself?
[16:44:05] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon i might try using http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-setDate
[16:44:12] <WebDragon> I just want to know if there's something similar to the onClose: in my script that will do the same thing when the field's already pre-loaded with a date
[16:44:12] <robertmaxrees> and see if that works maybe?
[16:44:44] <Stragler> https://dpaste.de/A5Ww robertmaxrees taplar_
[16:45:21] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon also, why is that in the close handler?  any reason it's not onSelect?
[16:45:38] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: originally I
[16:45:44] <WebDragon> damn stupid ' key
[16:45:50] <Stragler> after I load in the returned HTML from /artists I want to be able to access the #artistpage id
[16:46:07] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: originally I'm pulling the script from an online tute and modifying the details to suit my individual needs
[16:46:08] <robertmaxrees> Stragler yeah, because $.get() is async, anything that relies on it being done needs to be in its success callback.
[16:46:24] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon okay?  not sure what that has to do with my advice :)
[16:46:33] <taplar_> hold on, you already have an element with an id of artistpage
[16:46:47] <WebDragon> so I could use onSelect for this instead of onClose ? or a combination of the two ...  ?
[16:48:17] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon the question about onSelect vs onClose was just a generic one - not specific to your problem.
[16:48:51] <WebDragon> no but I think you're on to something there
[16:49:02] <WebDragon> looking at the API docs now
[16:49:10] <robertmaxrees> either way, you may need to just manually set the date after init.
[16:49:27] <Stragler> taplar_: Yes, the artistpage id is in the HTML which is returned from the /artists ajax call
[16:49:41] <WebDragon> well the date will be filled in by php when you edit an existing post, or after you save a new post
[16:50:07] <WebDragon> I just want the visual appearance of the datepicker to remain consistent with regards to the mindate maxdate
[16:50:13] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:50:13] <taplar_> ah, gotcha.  yeah you can't do that binding how you are doing it as the element doesn't exist yet on the page
[16:50:18] <WebDragon> (if you click it again after having saved)
[16:51:02] <robertmaxrees> right.  you may just need to call that setDate method.
[16:51:44] * WebDragon nods and munches his way through a homemade chicken quesadilla pot-pie contemplatively 
[16:54:42] <Stragler> robertmaxrees taplar_ So when does it exist on my page? Because the second ajax (or the console.log in this current case) is supposed to be fired whenever you click on this HTML tag with the #artistpage id.
[16:55:22] <taplar_> it will exist after you load it.  which is when you would need to direct bind on it.  OR, change it to be a delegate binding
[16:55:52] <taplar_> $(preExistingParentSelector).on('click', '#artistpage', function(){ /* stuff */ });
[16:56:13] <WebDragon> onClose, it takes the selectedDate and sets the min/maxDate on the OPPosite field. but onSelect, I want to GRAB the opposite field's datevalue and set THIS field's min/maxDate
[16:56:31] <WebDragon> in which case I wouldn't need the onClose. is that what you were saying, robertmaxrees ?
[16:57:05] <Stragler> taplar_: I did already load it thorugh. I can see it, and I physicallly click on it, but still it doesn’t work
[16:57:35] <taplar_> you seeing it vs it being available when you try to bind on it are two different things
[16:58:13] <taplar_> as robert mentioned, ajax is asynchronous.  meaning there is a high probability that the request to retrieve that data will still be active at the point that it tries to bind on it, with it not existing on the page yet
[17:01:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:01:39] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon i was just suggestion onSelect instead of onClose.  really not a big deal.
[17:02:10] <robertmaxrees> *suggesting
[17:02:30] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: yeah but as this was not originally my code, I'm working through the logic of this change out loud
[17:02:49] <robertmaxrees> kay
[17:03:30] <WebDragon> because half the time, in an effort to explain the problem to someone else, in English (or whatever language), you solve the problem in your head as you're putting the words together xD
[17:03:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:03:45] <robertmaxrees> it's called Rubber Duck Debugging.
[17:03:58] <WebDragon> hehe yeap
[17:05:08] <taplar_> i prefer AD&D over RD&D
[17:05:15] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:06:29] <GanzAndere> Is there a way to get geolocation data based on ip address?
[17:06:49] <taplar_> googs may have a service for that
[17:06:51] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere yeah, using a 3rd party service.
[17:07:05] <robertmaxrees> though that's not terribly accurate sometimes.
[17:07:12] <GanzAndere> Well, accuracy isn't i mprotnt
[17:07:13] <GanzAndere> at all.
[17:07:23] <robertmaxrees> even if it's the wrong side of the country? ;)
[17:07:24] <GanzAndere> as long as it's in like a 10-20-30 mile radius
[17:07:25] <GanzAndere> we're good
[17:07:27] <robertmaxrees> what kind of feature are you building?
[17:07:31] <GanzAndere> oh
[17:07:31] <GanzAndere> here
[17:08:07] <GanzAndere> I jsut got a ridiculous talk on ethics by some goofy holier than thou programmers in some other channel.
[17:08:17] <GanzAndere> https://marijuanadaily.net/cannadeals/
[17:08:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:08:29] <GanzAndere> So, based on your geolocation (html5 api) you get deals/coupons
[17:08:30] <GanzAndere> right?
[17:08:35] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[17:08:38] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things.
[17:08:50] <GanzAndere> Now, if for Any reason, should they deny it, or should they not knwo their locatio is off, or something
[17:08:54] * taplar_ waits for robert to stoke a joke
[17:08:56] <GanzAndere> I want to stil ldisplay local coupons
[17:09:04] <GanzAndere> Ther'e snothing unethical about that.
[17:09:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:09:13] <robertmaxrees> there is though
[17:09:13] <GanzAndere> as long as the copuons are in the same city, that'll work
[17:09:17] <GanzAndere> yeah ...
[17:09:19] <taplar_> didn't say there was.  but i'll still crack jokes
[17:09:20] <GanzAndere> depend son how you kind ause it
[17:09:21] <robertmaxrees> "I don't want to share my information with you".
[17:09:30] <GanzAndere> sure, then dont'
[17:09:33] <GanzAndere> I still won't kno wit
[17:09:37] <GanzAndere> ip base d isn't accurate
[17:09:44] <GanzAndere> but it should get the sam ecity
[17:09:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:09:50] <GanzAndere> hopefully
[17:09:55] <robertmaxrees> i get located in neighboring towns all the time.
[17:09:57] <GanzAndere> i mean, you know what I mean
[17:10:03] <GanzAndere> that's cool too
[17:10:11] <GanzAndere> there are not many dispensaries
[17:10:13] <robertmaxrees> and if the user said "i don't want to share my location", respect their choice.
[17:10:23] <GanzAndere> what if the user has no idea their location services are off
[17:10:33] <GanzAndere> It happened yesterday
[17:10:47] <GanzAndere> while testing a buddy came over, he couldn' tifgure out why my app won't workon his phone
[17:10:47] <robertmaxrees> Then make sure they can set their location on your site themself.
[17:11:29] <WebDragon> taplar_: LOL @ ad&d vs rd&d
[17:12:33] <WebDragon> https://hastebin.com/gudojekoke.js  so, slightly revised to replace the onclose SETTING the opposite side's option, I think I've got it so that onSelect, it pulls the opp-side date and sets THIS side's option
[17:13:03] <WebDragon> unless I'm completely decaffeinated at this point, I think I've got it, but would appreciate an experienced eye for a quick glance
[17:13:13] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon well...
[17:13:18] <robertmaxrees> did you try it on your page?
[17:13:21] <GanzAndere> so
[17:13:22] <GanzAndere> hey
[17:13:30] <WebDragon> not yet, but that's next
[17:13:34] <GanzAndere> https://marijuanadaily.net/cannadeals/ <- I don't like this... gets too many coupons
[17:13:35] <robertmaxrees> so try it.
[17:13:42] <GanzAndere> no... sorting.
[17:13:45] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere dunno what to tell you duder.
[17:13:45] <WebDragon> just thought I'd share first in case someone were to go hey, wait....
[17:13:51] <GanzAndere> hang on broski
[17:13:53] <GanzAndere> gimme one
[17:14:04] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere i deal with location stuff at my own job.
[17:14:07] <robertmaxrees> respect the user's choice.
[17:14:49] <GanzAndere> YEah, well sometimes th euser is tupid
[17:14:57] <GanzAndere> and you can't respect stupdi decions
[17:14:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:15:00] <GanzAndere> what the hell?
[17:15:15] <GanzAndere> How have we convinced ourselves that evrery stupid decision has to be respected?
[17:15:16] <robertmaxrees> you need to give them a way to manually set their location.
[17:15:20] <GanzAndere> Some decision are just stupid.
[17:15:24] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, oh.
[17:15:28] <GanzAndere> Ohhhhh. I see.
[17:15:31] <robertmaxrees> which i already suggested.
[17:15:36] <GanzAndere> Interesting development.
[17:15:40] <GanzAndere> The plot thickens.
[17:15:46] <GanzAndere> so... what. ike a drop down?
[17:15:46] <robertmaxrees> and if they still don't want to, you need to let them browse by city.
[17:15:47] <WebDragon> and the light dawns as the plot thickens
[17:15:49] <GanzAndere> they can select their state?
[17:15:52] <GanzAndere> hunyh.
[17:15:54] <GanzAndere> that never occured tome.
[17:15:59] <GanzAndere> you sir, are a smart man.
[17:16:00] <robertmaxrees> let them enter their zip.
[17:16:11] <GanzAndere> yeah no.
[17:16:17] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:16:19] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[17:16:19] <GanzAndere> some people can't type.
[17:16:22] <robertmaxrees> dude
[17:16:24] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:16:25] <GanzAndere> dude, I'm dealing w/ medical patients.
[17:16:26] <GanzAndere> ffs.
[17:16:35] <GanzAndere> i know a lot of the veterans can't type a lot on tiny phones
[17:16:35] <WebDragon> GanzAndere: now you know why we hang around here. you can't help but get smarter by surrounding yourself with other intelligent folks and being willing to listen to reason
[17:16:42] <GanzAndere> I gotta give them a way to select w/o typing
[17:16:52] <sillyslux> No Deals You must allow us to use your location! lol
[17:16:54] <robertmaxrees> i deal with a far larger userbase than you do and have to handle accessibility issues.
[17:16:57] <GanzAndere> sillyslux, see?
[17:17:01] <GanzAndere> Ialady say that
[17:17:08] <GanzAndere> I alrady*
[17:17:11] <GanzAndere> my fingers suck today
[17:17:12] <GanzAndere> too cold.
[17:17:22] <robertmaxrees> make it dead simple and obvious on how to set their zip.
[17:17:29] * WebDragon hands GanzAndere a spare fresh hot chicken quesadilla pot pie
[17:17:34] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, let them browse by location.
[17:17:40] <robertmaxrees> not that difficult.
[17:17:40] <GanzAndere> https://marijuanadaily.net/cannadeals/ <- how's this test script
[17:17:47] <GanzAndere> I made it so that it doesn't give you coupons when yo ugo there
[17:17:49] <GanzAndere> you have to click a button
[17:17:53] <GanzAndere> I can make a dropdown w/ location.
[17:17:56] <GanzAndere> that's not hard.
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> don't use a dropdown, duder.
[17:18:03] <GanzAndere> ok
[17:18:04] <GanzAndere> what then?
[17:18:07] <robertmaxrees> an input.
[17:18:08] <robertmaxrees> for zip.
[17:18:09] <GanzAndere> like a picture of a us map
[17:18:17] <GanzAndere> no man, they dont' wanna type
[17:18:23] <GanzAndere> two guys i know have no hands.
[17:18:36] <GanzAndere> iraq trip.
[17:18:51] <WebDragon> hm doesn't seem to be working
[17:18:52] <robertmaxrees> then solve that problem next.
[17:18:59] <GanzAndere> WebDragon, it should be working
[17:19:03] <GanzAndere> oh
[17:19:05] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere do you have any jQuery questions?
[17:19:09] <WebDragon> my thing, nnot yours LOL :)
[17:19:09] <GanzAndere> hangon
[17:19:37] * WebDragon headscratches and goes to refuel his coffeemug. clearly my caffeine levels are dropping
[17:19:43] <GanzAndere> ok fine.
[17:19:47] <GanzAndere> I'll let them enter a zip.
[17:19:49] <GanzAndere> you dork.
[17:19:50] <GanzAndere> <3
[17:20:01] <GanzAndere> i just realized, they can talk into th ephone.
[17:20:06] <GanzAndere> they already do that.
[17:20:22] <GanzAndere> thanks for the ideas, man, I appreciate you.
[17:20:31] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[17:20:36] <Stragler> robertmaxrees taplar_ https://dpaste.de/q0eE this still doenst work. I put the id in the callback.
[17:21:10] <robertmaxrees> Stragler "doesn't work" as in...?
[17:21:16] <taplar_> uh, no.  seriously man, just use a delegate binding
[17:21:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:21:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:22:56] <Stragler> what is delegate binding? .delegate and .bind?
[17:23:05] <taplar_> i gave an example in chat earlier
[17:23:11] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:23:24] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[17:24:01] <Stragler> $(preExistingParentSelector).on('click', '#artistpage', function(){ /* stuff */ }); this example right?
[17:24:51] <taplar_> yep
[17:27:10] <jak2000> hi all
[17:27:15] <jak2000> taplar_?
[17:27:17] <jak2000> are you there?
[17:27:22] <Stragler> Oh I think I know what to do. So if I have a container <div> with an id=“container” which is where the HTML requested from my first ajaxcall is being inserted to, I’ll use that as the parent selector, then #artistpage inside the .on() function?
[17:27:25] <taplar_> yep
[17:27:48] <taplar_> Stragler: yes
[17:28:02] <jak2000> escuse me ask directly but in other times helped me with this: can you see: http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples
[17:28:06] <jak2000> example 6 ?
[17:28:22] <taplar_> jak2000: sure
[17:28:47] <jak2000> ok my question is:
[17:28:49] <robertmaxrees> "see"?
[17:28:56] <jak2000> robertmaxrees :*
[17:29:31] <Stragler> Thank you so much robertmaxrees and taplar_ !! it worked
[17:29:40] <jak2000> in OnAjax... execute the url: url: 'example.php'  right?
[17:29:42] <robertmaxrees> aces, bruddah
[17:30:08] <jak2000> when i execute i return a json variable, how to evaluate it and send an alert?
[17:30:08] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 wat
[17:30:17] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:30:23] <robertmaxrees> look at the onSuccess
[17:30:33] <robertmaxrees> console.log(data);
[17:30:40] <Stragler> Haha robertmaxrees
[17:30:44] <jak2000> ok testing
[17:30:47] <taplar_> http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#documentation  look at the bottom jak2000
[17:32:15] <jak2000> ok... but how to know if return is false?
[17:32:35] <jak2000> testing: onSuccess: function (data, textStatus, jqXHR) {
[17:32:35] <jak2000>                         console.log(json.xmsg);
[17:32:46] <robertmaxrees> data
[17:33:05] <robertmaxrees> that example you shared has a js snippet that shows you how to do that.
[17:34:48] <jak2000> yes
[17:34:53] <jak2000> json.xmsg is undefined
[17:35:02] <robertmaxrees> because that's not what it's called there.
[17:35:04] <robertmaxrees> it's called data
[17:35:09] <robertmaxrees> data.xmsg
[17:35:18] <robertmaxrees> or whatever - try just doing console.log(data)
[17:35:24] <jak2000> ok
[17:35:47] <jak2000> data = Object {xmsg: "Error, Este Articulo no se puede Borrar, tiene Historial en el movimiento de Compras"}, textStatus = "success", jqXHR = Object
[17:35:59] <robertmaxrees> so there you go.
[17:37:21] <WebDragon> https://hastebin.com/rowacacawu.lua I paired it down but it's still not working
[17:37:26] <WebDragon> pared*
[17:37:40] <WebDragon> is $(this) the wrong 'this' to use?
[17:38:17] <jak2000> other thing: http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples     if tou see all tables with rows  samples have a button (edit or Delete)  yes? how to show the button or hidde?   (if canedit then showEditButton else hiddeEditButton) ?
[17:38:18] <WebDragon> the api docs are non-specific and don't show even one example of which 'this' one is to use
[17:41:01] <WebDragon> oh frig. THERE's my thinko
[17:42:03] <WebDragon> onSelect is not 'when you pop up the datepicker' by selecting the field, it's 'when you select a date in the popped up datepicker'
[17:43:14] <WebDragon> doesn't seem to be an onEnter or somesuch
[17:44:18] <jak2000> editButton :)
[17:44:25] <taplar_> enter as in the enter key?
[17:44:25] <jak2000> but....
[17:45:07] <jak2000> mmm arghh: editButton is a general variable, show or not, but how to do for a specific Row ? thanks
[17:48:14] <WebDragon> oooooooooooooookay, this is strange. .datepicker("getDate") isn't retrieving the value set in the field
[17:48:52] <taplar_> it returns the Date that was last selected/entered i believe
[17:50:07] <taplar_> iirc datepicker has two different hooks, onSelect and onChange
[17:52:30] <WebDragon> ok NOW it works like the way I wanted it to. went back to onChange, but set a hard-coded beginning so that if you're reloading the page after a save, or if you're editing an existing post, the minmax is still visible when you first pop up the datepicker
[17:52:59] <WebDragon> https://hastebin.com/uganalemup.js  this one does what I want
[17:53:23] <WebDragon> presets the minmax sensibly and updates them when changed
[17:53:43] <WebDragon> I was thinking about it the wrong way
[17:54:14] * WebDragon sips his DragonCoffee™ contemplatively
[17:54:21] <WebDragon> ok contemplation over, back to work
[17:54:32] <taplar_> i might suggest caching those lookups
[17:55:13] <WebDragon> it's basically part of a plugin for wordpress for a custom post type "featured entree" with title, desc, start/stop date and that's it
[17:55:28] <taplar_> still wouldn't hurt
[17:55:44] <WebDragon> so the only time those fields even get seen is on the admin side when editing them, or when reviewing the posts list overview
[17:56:06] <WebDragon> but the values are all pulled from the db by WP when viewing things client-side so that's the only place caching is gonna be relevant
[17:56:34] <WebDragon> but if you mean save the selectors in a variable for re-use, yeah, I can see that
[17:56:38] <taplar_> uh, i think maybe you're misunderstanding what i mean
[17:56:40] <taplar_> yes, that
[17:56:42] <WebDragon> that makes sense
[17:57:08] <WebDragon> got my head too far up wordpress's internals to think straight
[17:57:12] <taplar_> :)
[17:57:13] <WebDragon> :D
[18:03:20] <WebDragon> done.
[18:03:57] <WebDragon> this is what I get for starting with someone else's code example instead of writing it from scratch
[18:04:01] <WebDragon> xD
[18:04:20] <taplar_> *shrug* examples can be good
[18:04:53] <taplar_> lord knows in the absence of documentation if examples didn't exist for some of the things i've had to do in the past, i'd have probably offed myself
[18:06:44] <jak2000> robertmaxrees are you there?
[18:07:04] <robertmaxrees> just got back.
[18:07:14] <robertmaxrees> 450 someodd other people here, too.
[18:08:05] <jak2000> yes understand
[18:08:14] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:08:52] <robertmaxrees> despite what people may tell you, I am not a gatekeeper of knowledge
[18:10:21] <taplar_> everybody wants a piece of the apple
[18:10:54] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:13:21] <jak2000> ok, later reasking the question :)
[18:13:27] <jak2000> much tanks...
[18:13:40] * jak2000 send 8 pack of miller high life to robertmaxrees...
[18:14:24] <taplar_> "the champagne of beers" interesting
[18:14:40] <robertmaxrees> nah, i'd take some SN pale though ;)
[18:15:01] * jak2000 send 8 pack of miller BudLight to robertmaxrees...
[18:15:07] <robertmaxrees> hahahhaa
[18:15:07] <jak2000> hehe for Taplar :)
[18:15:10] <taplar_> i had to enter in my birthday to go to the website.  that's secure
[18:15:24] <jak2000> give me your website pls
[18:15:26] <jak2000> the url
[18:15:34] <taplar_> https://www.millerhighlife.com/
[18:16:15] <jak2000> :)
[18:16:52] <taplar_> #iamrich
[18:17:02] <taplar_> ... i don't understand this marketing ploy
[18:17:24] <robertmaxrees> it's tongue-in-cheek
[18:17:38] <taplar_> lol
[18:17:54] <WebDragon> taplar_: yeah no kidding. I learn mostly from examples so if they didn't exist (so I could learn from other's mistakes) i'd be in a rough way :D
[18:18:05] <WebDragon> (re your earlier statement. I was afk a bit)
[18:18:33] <taplar_> i don't believe you.  you ignored me.  <3 le broken
[18:18:39] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:19:01] <WebDragon> rofl
[18:19:51] <WebDragon> the amount of general whimsy that programmers need to acquire in order to stay sane and keep laughing at the universe, is astounding.
[18:20:06] <robertmaxrees> it's far less than you think.
[18:20:10] <WebDragon> it's a beautiful thing, don't get me wrong. I wish more people had this level of whimsy
[18:20:25] <robertmaxrees> you said you rely on examples a lot, yeah?>
[18:20:36] <WebDragon> it's depressing as hell being in an office full of VERY SERIOUS PEOPLE who are VERY SERIOUS at their jobs
[18:21:05] <WebDragon> I learn best from examples. a dry explanation of the API without showing how to use it, is largely useless to me
[18:21:26] <robertmaxrees> most good documentation also has examples.
[18:21:27] <WebDragon> I wind up poking around in the dark for a long time before finding what works, when that's the case
[18:21:32] <WebDragon> agreed.
[18:21:35] <taplar_> that's what she said
[18:21:47] <robertmaxrees> but the documentation will have very salient information for you to understand.
[18:21:48] <WebDragon> but we don't always get that. I'm looking at you X-Cart and you too, Magento
[18:22:06] <robertmaxrees> the jquery api docs for direct vs delegated events are a great example.
[18:22:07] <WebDragon> those guys are all "but the code IS the documentation"
[18:22:17] <WebDragon> yeah agreed. the jqapi stuff is great
[18:22:24] <robertmaxrees> if the api is designed right, then yeah, it is the documentation.
[18:22:48] <WebDragon> but examples are always welcome because there's always some interesting thing you can do with it if you know what you're doing, and it
[18:22:57] <WebDragon> is THAT stuff that sparks off the imagination
[18:22:57] <taplar_> i think either to the extreme is a bad thing.  like, i think it was docushare that i had to integrate with years ago.  TERRIBLE documentation.  and terrible examples.
[18:23:06] <taplar_> it was literally trial and error to figure out how to use it
[18:23:06] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:23:09] <WebDragon> heh docushare
[18:23:15] <robertmaxrees> Solid documentation is important, absolutely.
[18:23:21] * WebDragon nodnods
[18:23:29] <robertmaxrees> but relying on examples is bad imo.
[18:23:32] * WebDragon passes around the coffee and Jameson
[18:23:44] <robertmaxrees> copy/pasting and poking around is kind of a bad idea.
[18:23:49] <WebDragon> no I am not saying I rely on them, just that I learn fastest FROM them
[18:24:33] <WebDragon> I look at stuff all over stackoverflow before making up my mind what to *actually* do, because by and large a lot of the questions being asked are months and even years out of date
[18:25:00] <robertmaxrees> heh, that's the kind of thing you shouldn't need to rely on.
[18:25:06] <taplar_> yeah but you have to be careful of just taking the answer, and not learning why it is the answer
[18:25:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:25:12] <WebDragon> even the wordpress plugin code tute I'm working with uses some outdated methods I've had to replace as I work through it and modernize the stuff
[18:25:44] <WebDragon> taplar_: exactly, you can't just take the answer at face value and expect to cut and paste it in. sheep dip don't work like that
[18:26:00] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon but you're saying that's how you work >.>
[18:26:05] <taplar_> sheep dip?
[18:26:12] <WebDragon> sheiat* (my irc client replaces it with 'sheep dip' because of one channel's bot not liking swearing)
[18:26:22] <WebDragon> xD
[18:26:25] <taplar_> aaaaah
[18:26:29] <taplar_> lmao
[18:26:39] <WebDragon> but I'm from NY originally and can't help myself
[18:26:44] <taplar_> i'm going to start using that
[18:26:48] <WebDragon> LOL
[18:27:03] <WebDragon> excellent
[18:27:28] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: I'm perhaps not being general enough due to lack of sleep and caffeine
[18:27:44] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[18:28:17] <WebDragon> it's not a hard and fast rule. Heck, I read through the perl Camel cover to cover several times, and each time I picked up new things
[18:28:59] <WebDragon> but *seeing how things work* is more effective for me, than saying to me " you use this function to do that. figure out the imeplementation yourself"
[18:29:24] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts there fwiw.
[18:29:26] <robertmaxrees> but okie :)
[18:29:28] <WebDragon> I could spend hours poking at it til I get it right, without a good example to base off of as a point of departure
[18:30:05] <WebDragon> I dont mean a function like sin() there
[18:30:18] <WebDragon> and again am tripping over terminology when I mean something else
[18:30:29] <taplar_> i think there are different view points on it.  a different person could look at the same thing and say "you use this function to do this" and they run off with "oh, well if it can do that, then that means I can use it to do this and this and this"
[18:30:56] <WebDragon> some of us are like kindling and need a spark to set off the ideas
[18:31:24] <taplar_> oh, don't take what i say in any way as criticism.  just making a statement
[18:31:33] <taplar_> different ways to learn
[18:31:38] <WebDragon> oh no, I don't at all. I know how my mind works and I'm used to it :)
[18:31:41] <WebDragon> exactly
[18:31:44] <WebDragon> no one learns the same way
[18:31:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm more trying to illuminate the fact that there's a distinction between "knowing how to read documentation" and "knowing how an api works".  i won't fault somebody for not knowing about the delegated syntax of $.fn.on, for instance, but I do fault them when they simpyl skip to the first example and ignore the rest of the docs.
[18:32:15] <robertmaxrees> all about becoming self-sufficient.
[18:32:26] <taplar_> the TL;DR, tell me how to do it, mentality, eh?
[18:32:27] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: no, I agree with you there. I read the docs, AND the examples, because they complement each other
[18:32:57] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon but you didn't really read the docs for the calendar widget earlier heh
[18:33:35] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: I didn't have time or inclination to read ALL the docs, as I'm somewhat undercaffeinated and it's already 18:33 here
[18:33:40] <taplar_> catch you guys luego
[18:33:41] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:33:47] <robertmaxrees> peace taplar_
[18:33:52] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon i wasn't saying that.
[18:34:01] <WebDragon> it didn't occur to me to go look at the API docs til you mentioned it, TBH :)
[18:34:11] <robertmaxrees> which is exactly the kind of point i'm making.
[18:34:24] <WebDragon> at that point I went and made a fresh pot as it was clear I needed to
[18:35:48] <WebDragon> but my point also was that there's more than 20 pieces of that API on the page, and having a suggestion where to start, is far better than trying to figure things out by reading ALL the docs for all the irrelevant functions to what i was trying to achieve.
[18:35:49] <robertmaxrees> you make it sound like you've been at it for like 16 hours already.
[18:36:41] <WebDragon> nah, not the jquery stuff, I've been at the WP plugin stuff for hours. the jquery stuff just needed a little tweaking but by that time I'd had my head in PHP and WP internals for quite a while and needed to make a mental paradigm shift
[18:37:06] <WebDragon> I was, as you may have noticed, a trifle slow, at that point
[18:37:29] <robertmaxrees> and the docs are pretty sensibly laid out (shrug).  when you wonder what stuff it supports and you have a basic question like "how do i set the date for the widget?" and then see a link that says "setDate" >.>
[18:37:31] * WebDragon sands down a rough spot on the counter with the dryness of his comment
[18:38:36] <WebDragon> some things are obvious in retrospect, and if I was spending my whole day working with jquery and jqui I'd have been more inclined to think in terms of that
[18:38:49] <robertmaxrees> heh, just providing some feedback, yo.
[18:38:57] <robertmaxrees> i don't spend my whole day in jq land either :)
[18:39:01] <WebDragon> hey no worries. :)
[18:39:23] <WebDragon> you guys here deal with people a LOT more obtuse than I am on low caffeine levels
[18:39:28] <WebDragon> xD
[18:39:46] <robertmaxrees> heh, so i take you your caffeione levels are low? ;)
[18:39:55] <WebDragon> not quite as much anymore
[18:40:53] <WebDragon> and not long from now, I'll be switching to the irish coffee over at my bud's house while we kick back and relax and bitch about our various work-related computer crap (I do webstuff, he works at the University NOC)
[18:41:18] <robertmaxrees> i was making a joke.  you've mentioned your caffeine intake like 8 times in the last hour or so ;)
[18:41:51] <WebDragon> well that was then. 'but halfway thru the fresh cup, now.
[18:41:57] <WebDragon> and I make goooooood coffee
[18:42:01] <robertmaxrees> lol

[20:35:39] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, hi
[20:36:22] <robertmaxrees> sup
[20:43:07] <GanzAndere> Hey guyt
[20:43:13] <robertmaxrees> sup
[20:43:21] <GanzAndere> https://news.marijuanadaily.net/coupons.html
[20:43:24] <GanzAndere> Geolocation was annoying.
[20:43:32] <GanzAndere> I figurd, when I go to sits, and they pop up asking me for geolocaiton crap
[20:43:36] <GanzAndere> That's SUPER annoying.
[20:43:43] <robertmaxrees> got a jquery question?
[20:43:46] <GanzAndere> So, forget ip to geolocation, why use geolocaiotn at all.
[20:43:53] <GanzAndere> Maybe.
[20:44:53] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, sometimes, you need context before you can think of solutions.
[20:45:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:45:10] <GanzAndere> It's not as cut and dry as "you have a jquery question?"
[20:45:16] <GanzAndere> That's unhelpful at best.
[20:45:19] <robertmaxrees> you're in the jquery channel
[20:45:25] <robertmaxrees> so the pretense is that you have a question about jquery ;)_
[20:45:27] <GanzAndere> Doesn't matter which channel.
[20:45:32] <GanzAndere> "you have a X question?"
[20:45:32] <robertmaxrees> actually it does!
[20:45:35] <GanzAndere> No.
[20:45:47] <GanzAndere> Not in the context you're talking about.
[20:46:15] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, are you new on irc or something?
[20:46:28] <GanzAndere> New on freenode? Overzealous about all this?
[20:46:29] <robertmaxrees> Actually it does.  It's the jquery support channel.  That's what it's here for.  If you have a jquery question, we're game!
[20:46:40] <GanzAndere> I might have had you not been kind of a dick.
[20:46:49] <GanzAndere> Patience, dude.
[20:46:53] <GanzAndere> Wait for bloody context.
[20:47:10] <robertmaxrees> Hey now - please don't insult anyone like that :)
[20:47:18] <GanzAndere> A person makes a peep and you jump on them, do you have a jquery question? Why not setup a bot to automatically spam people w/ that mesage?
[20:47:23] <GanzAndere> Would save you some hassle.
[20:47:36] <robertmaxrees> If you have a problem with that, feel free to PM me about it.
[20:47:41] <GanzAndere> No thanks.
[20:47:49] <robertmaxrees> Otherwise, feel free to explain your problem and move on!
[20:47:52] <GanzAndere> The desire to speak w/ you further is gone.
[20:47:55] <GanzAndere> Have a good one.
[20:48:06] <GanzAndere> I'll explain it to another who is actually intersted.
[20:48:14] <robertmaxrees> I absolutely am interested!
[20:48:21] <GanzAndere> Someone who doesn't bagder users with "do you have a jquery question?"
[20:48:22] <robertmaxrees> Sorry if I gave you the impression I wasn't.
[20:48:29] <GanzAndere> why else do people come on irc?
[20:48:35] <robertmaxrees> please move on.
[20:48:37] <GanzAndere> in to a support channle?
[20:49:02] <GanzAndere> you did give me that impression, that you are impatient and wont' take the time to understand another's issue
[20:49:15] <GanzAndere> If you can't take th etime to do that, perhaps support on freenode is not your cup of tea.
[20:49:19] <GanzAndere> Peace.

[20:56:19] <robertmaxrees> hah
[21:59:00] <damo221> how do i filter a set of dom elements such that i want to exclude any elements whose children may contain a particular class of element?
[22:00:10] <damo221> eg, a bunch of tables with a td element with class "error" and exclude all the error tables
[22:01:31] <D-rex> damo221: $('td:not(.error)')
[22:02:16] <damo221> D-rex: i dont want to keep any of the table if it contains a error class td
[22:04:06] <damo221> as in, i want to exclude the whole table if any of its elements have an error class
[22:04:07] <D-rex>     $('.table_class').filter(function() { return !($(this).children().is('.error')); })
[22:04:13] <damo221> ohh
[22:04:23] <damo221> thank you
[23:14:58] <damo221> $('a[name="Race1"]').nextAll('table').filter(function() { return $(this).find().is('.Scratched'); });  <--- this returns an empty set but without the filter it returns a list of tables, what is wrong?
[23:54:15] <damo221> worked it out nm
