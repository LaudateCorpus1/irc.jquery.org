[00:00:36] <buzzybron> hi i am trying to work on a jquery plugin with $.extend
[00:00:59] <buzzybron> can someone direct me as to how can i add public functions with $.extend
[00:01:16] <Cork> buzzybron: you can't
[00:01:37] <Cork> you need to add them to the global scope
[00:01:47] <Cork> extend adds them to $.fn
[00:01:57] <Cork> (or possibly a different object
[00:01:59] <Cork> )
[00:02:39] <maasan> what is best way to scroll to top? $(window).scrollTop(0), $(document).scrollTop(0), $(html,body).scrollTop(0)
[00:04:10] <jphase> maasan: depends on how you want to do that stylistically imo. I like to use .animate with .scrollTop personally
[00:05:03] <maasan> jphase: Which one is correct method? will everything do the same work? are they any diff?
[00:06:12] <majuscule> why does fadeIn() add display: block and how can i avoid that?
[00:07:05] <jphase> maasan: if you just set the scrollTop of the window then it will just jump to the top immediately. Using something like $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $("#yourelement").offset().top }, 500);  would make it slide nicely to the id="yourelement"
[00:07:23] <jphase> maasan: or alternatively you could just exchange that with 0 to scroll to the top of the page
[00:09:01] <jphase> majuscule: Cork might know this better than I, but I'd probably start by trying .fadeIn().css('display', 'inherit'); or whatever you want the property as
[00:09:44] <maasan> jphase: Thanks. Does $(document).scrollTop(0) work?
[00:10:17] <jphase> maasan: hmm, I normally bind to window, I don't know if that's out of habit for any reason or if it's just how I do it =\
[00:10:22] <Baluse> jphase i mean bottom of the barel cpu
[00:10:45] <maasan> jphase: Okay understood
[00:12:45] <jphase> Baluse: there's not much you can do about that then besides minify your CSS, JS, and add compression. Your elements are made entirely with CSS and just about as good as you can get for load time (using all CSS, no images, good HTM5 code, etc.).
[00:13:32] <jphase> Baluse: really well done beginning to an app interface btw.
[00:27:03] <buzzybron> anyone has issue with .hover()? currently working on an overlay, and when the overlay using the hover(), it blinks
[00:27:39] <buzzybron> i know what is causing the issue, basically when the overlay pops up mouse is focusin on the new span div, and which is why it is triggering the hover method
[00:27:49] <buzzybron> any work arounds for this?
[00:38:08] <tobago> I tried this to delay the submit of form after typing something into a field: https://gist.github.com/trinibago/6822301
[00:39:14] <regedit> doug65536: still there?
[00:39:20] <tobago> but it doesn't delay...
[00:39:58] <LLckfan>  I have a Gateway laptop and when I opened the lid the power light was on but the laptop was aleep. then after i ushed the power it started flashing with the light bulb light and the battery light but only when it was plugged in. Is this a sign I need a new end tip for my power supply?
[00:41:05] <Cork> jphase: .css isn't animated, so you need to use the callback from fadeIn
[00:41:36] <jphase> ahh, I knew you'd know better
[00:41:51] <jphase> I wouldn't know 'til I tried it that it wouldn't work :X
[00:42:24] <regedit> if i create a var 'foo' in a function, an within this function i do an ajax call with .done() / .fail() handlers, will 'foo' still be visible & valid to use inside the .done() / .fail() functions?
[00:42:41] <Cork> yes
[00:42:59] <Cork> inline functions inherit the variables from the parent scope
[00:44:02] <regedit> Cork: even if the .done() / .fail() can be invoked multiple times & out of order (based on ajax response), each "instance" of the handlers will have its own correct "version" of the var?
[00:44:24] <tobago> how to delay submitting a form in firefox? https://gist.github.com/trinibago/6822301
[00:44:31] <Cork> regedit: yes, but there isn't several instances of the function
[00:44:39] <Cork> there is only one function for each declaration
[00:45:07] <Cork> ?mdn setTimeout @ tobago
[00:45:09] <jphase> tobago: you could wrap your .submit in a function and use setTimeout
[00:45:09] <b-ot> tobago: Mozilla Firefox Beta Release Notes → http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/5.0beta/releasenotes/
[00:45:17] <Cork> O_o
[00:45:20] <Cork> wtf...
[00:45:25] <jphase> hehe
[00:45:26] <Cork> ?g mdn setTimeout @ tobago
[00:45:27] <b-ot> tobago: Contact Us - Esquire → http://www.esquire.com/talk
[00:45:27] <jphase> fail
[00:45:35] <Cork> oook, the bot is broken
[00:45:41] <jphase> so cool that there's mdn though!!!
[00:45:57] <Cork> bot-t had ?mdc so not much difference
[00:46:06] * jphase has yet to successfully use the bot and fails on api references every he tries
[00:46:29] <Cork> jphase: you can use instance functions directly
[00:46:40] <Cork> but you need to prefix the generic functions with jquery.
[00:46:53] <Cork> ?api jquery.ajax
[00:46:53] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ajax(): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[00:50:54] <tobago> Cork, jphase I tried this: https://gist.github.com/trinibago/6822301 which I found in stackoverflow answer.
[00:51:09] <tobago> but it doesn't delay in firefox.
[00:51:19] <Cork> tobago: form[0].submit()
[00:51:29] <Cork> else you will retrigger the original handler
[00:51:34] <Cork> and cause an infinite loop
[00:51:52] <Cork> also if(form){ is pointless
[00:51:55] <Cork> it will always be true
[00:52:07] <Cork> as form will always have a jquery object
[00:52:22] <Cork> if(form.length < 1){ would work though
[00:52:28] <Cork> oh
[00:52:44] <Cork> opps scratch the loop comment, didn't notice that it wasn't a submit event
[00:52:45] <tobago> Cork, but that: https://gist.github.com/trinibago/6822301 changes anything in terms of it does not delay.
[00:53:18] <tobago> Cork, right. it's a keyup
[00:53:25] <Cork> tobago: is the keyup for enter?
[00:53:41] <Cork> if so then you need to handle the submit event from the form, not keyup on the field
[00:53:42] <tobago> I want to be able to typi in something and fire the submit only after some ms.
[00:53:53] <tobago> Cork, no. any key
[00:54:02] <Cork> tobago: what is doing the call?
[00:54:07] <Cork> is it autocomplete?
[00:54:32] <tobago> Cork, no. it returns an updated list (but yeah some kinda searching result)
[00:54:47] <Cork> tobago: what is triggering the submit?
[00:54:48] <tobago> but no autocomplete by its definition.
[00:54:57] <Cork> does it happen if you disable this handler all together?
[00:55:15] <tobago> trying
[00:56:59] <tobago> Cork,  mmh. odd. the submit fires even, when comment the entire event handler. I have to dig deeper...
[00:57:34] <Cork> tobago: so you have another handler somewhere handing the submission, and you need to do the delay there
[00:59:42] <tobago> Cork, right. fuck. there was the same stuff in another js file... some collegue wanted to kid me...
[00:59:54] <Cork> :)
[01:03:29] <tobago> Cork, got it workin... thank you!
[01:03:29] <Ububegin> str +="<tr>" + "<td>"+red+"</td"> .... str+="<tr>" + "<td>"+green+"</td">..... $('#tbody1').html(str) ... this forms the table..  I want the top half to be red and bottom hald to green...  I cant apply style to "<td  style="font-color:red">" ... this gives problem
[01:03:57] <Cork> Ububegin: use your css files
[01:04:59] <Ububegin> Cork: there are css files.. but I populate the table from a jquery/javascript method..  how to apply css such that first half is red and second half is green
[01:05:37] <lintguy> Hello.
[01:05:45] <lintguy> Why do i get "undefined" here? http://jsfiddle.net/Zxez4/
[01:05:52] <Cork> Ububegin: #tableid tbody tr:first-child {}  #tableid tbody tr:last-child {}
[01:07:15] <Cork> lintguy: cause the third and forth doesn't have that key
[01:07:56] <lintguy> Oh, yeah, that makes sense
[01:08:29] <lintguy> So how do i avoid undefined in these cases?
[01:08:49] <Ububegin> Cork: hi, the red color rows can be n rows and green color can be m rows.. I cant use first-child last child notations..
[01:09:43] <Cork> Ububegin: so add a class to the tr in the string then
[01:12:43] <Cork> lintguy: if(group.<key> !== undefined)
[01:13:01] <DarsVaeda> I want to submit a form when a select changes, how can I send a jumpmark with that so the page does not jump to top?
[01:13:30] <Cork> DarsVaeda: you can't
[01:13:49] <Cork> if you make a normal post you will do a full page reload
[01:13:53] <Cork> so the page will start at the top
[01:13:57] <lintguy> Cork: <key> is new to me
[01:14:02] <Cork> if you want to avoid that use ajax instead
[01:14:07] <DarsVaeda> how unfortunate
[01:14:12] <DarsVaeda> but thanks!
[01:14:14] <Cork> lintguy: it's a placeholder for the key you want to test
[01:14:31] <lintguy> Cork: Ah
[01:15:03] <Cork> so yes, that isn't valid js, but well... hope you get what i mean
[01:15:36] <Ububegin> Cork: how do i add the class tag....           before: "<tr>" --> "<tr class="red">" ... notice the ""  quotes.. the string is malformed
[01:15:54] <Cork> Ububegin: no on the tr element
[01:15:58] <Cork> if it is for the row
[01:16:12] <Cork> (also you should use a different class name then red
[01:16:19] <Cork> use it for what it means instead of how it looks
[01:16:42] <Cork> like "error" or "faulty" or "important" or what ever
[01:17:09] <Ububegin> Actually, i want to apply the css to the whole row...  you mean apply on the <td> element is it
[01:17:58] <Cork> Ububegin: uh... no
[01:18:05] <Cork> td is for columns, tr is for rows
[01:18:11] <Cork> so if you want it on rows add it to the row
[01:18:27] <Ububegin> is there a way to insert the ..." ...on a var str...
[01:18:37] <Cork> \"
[01:18:39] <Ububegin> if i could do it, problem solved
[01:18:45] <Cork> or use '<tr class="">'
[01:25:42] <nisseni> I have a script where I move around an area, when moving the area it updates an input field which then is posted by jquery, in chrome the field is updated by the script live, but not in firefox, am I missing something here?
[01:26:25] <Cork> nisseni: "where I move" how?
[01:26:49] <lite_> Is there any way to call a method every time a page is fully loaded? so far my $('body').load(function()) fires way too early(as in before the dom has been generated)
[01:27:04] <Ububegin> Cork: the escape character was smooth.. :)
[01:27:19] <nisseni> Cork: it's for setting a "printing-area" of an image, for printing on t-shirts for example, the client is suppose to set that area themselves
[01:27:21] <Cork> lite_: no .load is fired when the original html document has been parsed and all it's content has been loaded
[01:27:32] <Cork> lite_: this does NOT include ajax calls done by js
[01:27:51] <DarsVaeda> Cork: turns out you can just do <form action="action.php#jumphere">
[01:27:55] <Cork> nisseni: that isn't an answer
[01:28:20] <Cork> DarsVaeda: and that is sent cross the sever?
[01:28:27] <Cork> interesting, didn't think the browser did that...
[01:28:33] <Cork> DarsVaeda: thx for the info
[01:28:47] <lite_> Cork: Okay. So any suggestions as to how I can solve my problem? I want to run method fooFunc() but not untill data is set and the dom reflects this
[01:29:08] <Cork> lite_: run it from the ajax callback
[01:29:41] <cam> What happens if I have <div><b>test</b></div> and I do $(mydiv).text() - do I get "test"?
[01:29:43] <Cork> lite_: you don't have any dom event you can depend on if you add content through ajax
[01:29:51] <Cork> cam: yes
[01:29:56] <cam> oh that's so col
[01:29:58] <cam> *cool
[01:30:03] <cam> :>
[01:30:11] <lite_> Cork: right. So there are multiple triggers where I may need to call the function.
[01:30:36] <Cork> lite_: then you need to keep track of the callbacks and call it when all has been fired
[01:30:47] <Cork> deferred and $.when might help there
[01:31:17] <lite_> At this point I wish I was the guy who wrote the implementation of the ajax calls and had an actual understanding of the flow here :/
[01:31:22] <nisseni> Cork: what would an answer look like?
[01:31:38] <Cork> nisseni: not enough info
[01:32:03] <Cork> nisseni: you didn't answer the how question
[01:32:26] <Cork> you answered what and why, but now how
[01:32:39] <nisseni> Cork: I'm "dragin-and-dropping" an area that is layed over an image
[01:32:47] <Cork> how
[01:32:56] <Cork> thoguh draggable? native js?
[01:33:00] <Cork> html d&d?
[01:33:01] <Cork> how?
[01:33:32] <nisseni> Cork: I didn't write the script, but js, I suppose, pretty sure
[01:33:38] <Cork> ok
[01:33:54] <Cork> nisseni: then you need to look into what the script does
[01:34:02] <Cork> how it updates the input field
[01:34:30] <LLckfan> I have a Gateway laptop and when I opened the lid the power light was on but the laptop was asleep. When I pushed the power it started flashing with the lights for the light bulb and the battery but only when it was plugged in. Is this a sign I need a new tip end for my charger?
[01:34:31] <nisseni> Cork: it changes the area coordinates in an input field. This works properly in chrome, not inff
[01:34:43] <Cork> LLckfan: off topic for this channel
[01:35:08] <Cork> nisseni: again find how this happens and show the code
[01:35:27] <Cork> nisseni: from what you've told me this far i can only say "wfm"
[01:35:31] <Cork> and that won't help you
[01:36:20] <buzzybron1> i have .hover with an overlay div appearing, it's giving me a flickering problem, does anyone know the fix for htis?
[01:36:51] <Cork> buzzybron1: can you reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net?
[01:37:03] <buzzybron1> gimme a sec
[01:37:34] <schonert> Can i some how force the browser to load an image out of viewport?
[01:37:49] <Cork> schonert: no, not in modern browsers
[01:38:04] <Cork> schonert: you can trigger it to be fetched from the server
[01:38:07] <Cork> but not rendered
[01:38:37] <schonert> Cork how can i trigger it to be fetched? I't might be enough
[01:38:51] <Cork> ?g javascript image preload
[01:38:51] <b-ot> Cork: 3+ Ways to Preload Images Using CSS, JavaScript, or Ajax ... → http://perishablepress.com/3-ways-preload-images-css-javascript-ajax/
[01:39:04] <schonert> Cork awesome - thanks!
[01:39:24] <Cork> schonert: basically you create an image element and loop over the url's to trigger them to be cached
[01:40:04] <Cork> though browsers tries really hard to not touch images that isn't visible
[01:40:21] <Cork> so expect that it might stop working in a little while
[01:41:03] <schonert> Cork - that's a bummer.. A bump on the hover
[01:41:29] <Cork> schonert: doesn't say it WILL happen, just that you should be prepared for it
[01:41:48] <Cork> browser fight hard to reduce memory use, and images is a quite big part of that
[01:42:16] <Cork> schonert: if the images is reasonably small you can try using a splice
[01:42:46] <schonert> Cork it's an small icon
[01:42:56] <Cork> then it sounds like you should use a splice
[01:43:04] <Cork> put all states in one image
[01:43:08] <schonert> i'll pm you with the live example - if you don't mind?
[01:43:16] <Cork> and through css background-position switch image
[01:43:21] <buzzybron1> Cork : take a look at this > http://jsfiddle.net/78JRu/
[01:43:34] <Cork> schonert: na, i don't have the time to look at it anyway
[01:43:38] <buzzybron1> basically do a mouseover the good ol text
[01:43:53] <buzzybron1> and when you do so, there is suppose to be a hint overlay
[01:43:58] <schonert> Cork Thanks for the help :-)
[01:44:47] <buzzybron1> if you move your mouse over the hint overlay, the overlay will keep triggering the hover since the overlay is not the element which hover is listening to, not quite sure if you get it
[01:44:55] <Cork> buzzybron1: you insert a new element on hover
[01:45:08] <Cork> that might be the casue
[01:45:35] <Cork> ah
[01:45:46] <Cork> buzzybron1: use mouseenter/museleave instead of hover
[01:46:00] <Cork> then it won't trigger when you move from parent to child
[01:48:03] <buzzybron1> like this> http://jsfiddle.net/78JRu/1/
[01:48:08] <buzzybron1> still having the same problem
[01:48:32] <Cork> how do i see the flickering in the fiddle?
[01:48:51] <buzzybron1> just move your  mouse to the good ol text, and move it for a bit
[01:49:33] <buzzybron1> try this > http://jsfiddle.net/78JRu/2/
[01:50:56] <Cork> ah, it only happens if you move over the overlay
[01:51:31] <Cork> the simplest solution would be to make sure the overlay never is over the target element
[01:52:59] <buzzybron1> Cork : thanks! but i've just fixed it using a container div and use the listerner on the container div, for reference here it is > http://jsfiddle.net/78JRu/2/
[01:55:47] <MJCDoffice> Hey guys, total jquery noob just trying to quickly help out a colleague
[01:55:56] <MJCDoffice> he's trying to adapt some code
[01:56:00] <MJCDoffice> <button class="modalInput" rel="#yesno">Yes or no?</button>
[01:56:15] <MJCDoffice> realistically we just want to trigger the same action this would from within the same scope
[01:56:21] <MJCDoffice> but without the button lol
[01:56:41] <MJCDoffice> no idea what #yesno is even meant to mean heh
[01:57:20] <Cork> MJCDoffice: that sounds like some special code that checks the rel attribute, or the class attribute
[01:57:40] <MJCDoffice> yeah, so much of this seems like blackbox tech
[01:57:44] <Cork> MJCDoffice: none of that is jquery inspired solutions, or even common as far as i know
[01:57:46] <MJCDoffice> where you cant really see the actual flow
[01:57:59] <Cork> MJCDoffice: check the code for event listeners
[01:58:20] <MJCDoffice> but the button has no ID or anything
[01:58:34] <Cork> you can still build a selector for it
[01:58:37] <MJCDoffice> so not sure how itd easily add a handler dynamically to it
[01:58:39] <MJCDoffice> hmm
[01:58:44] <Cork> $('.modalImput')
[01:58:53] <MJCDoffice> ooh yeah true
[01:58:58] <Cork> or $('[rel="#yesno"]')
[01:59:04] <Cork> or similar
[01:59:27] <Cork> could be based on it being a child of the form
[01:59:31] <Cork> or ... what ever
[01:59:47] <Cork> MJCDoffice: might also be that this button doesn't do anything beside the default submit action
[01:59:57] <Cork> MJCDoffice: and then it would be a submit event on the parent form
[01:59:59] <MJCDoffice> nah it launches a modal dialog
[02:00:06] <Cork> could still be from the form
[02:00:08] <MJCDoffice> perhaps theres an easier way?
[02:00:34] <MJCDoffice> I hate so much about jquery.. like theres a modal class in the CSS but none of it hides the actual modal (eg; display: none; or similar)
[02:00:39] <Cork> you would have to know what listens for the action to be able to simulate it
[02:00:39] <MJCDoffice> it just comes from *somewhere*
[02:00:48] <MJCDoffice> well there's two event handlers
[02:00:52] <MJCDoffice> one is exactly as described
[02:00:58] <MJCDoffice> but only seems to be to trigger the overlay
[02:01:01] <MJCDoffice> sec
[02:01:02] <Cork> MJCDoffice: that isn't jquery, it is just how css works
[02:01:18] <Cork> jquery is just a set of function to help you work with the dom
[02:01:23] <MJCDoffice> lol so .modal is just magically hidden as part of the css standard?
[02:01:25] <Cork> there is very little magic in jquery
[02:01:26] <MJCDoffice> seems unlikely :P
[02:01:45] <Cork> MJCDoffice: no modal isn't part of css, dom, html OR jquery
[02:01:58] <MJCDoffice> right, exactly
[02:02:01] <MJCDoffice> so if its not in MY css
[02:02:07] <MJCDoffice> the only other css is jquery/jquery mobile
[02:02:55] <Cork> MJCDoffice: that is from jquery tools
[02:03:06] <Cork> that's a third party plugin that builds ontop of jquery
[02:03:28] <MJCDoffice> they dont seeeem to be loading anything else
[02:03:32] <MJCDoffice> just jquery or jquery mobile
[02:03:41] <Cork> http://jquerytools.org/demos/overlay/modal-dialog.html <--
[02:03:53] <lite_> is there a tool available to see exactly which events are triggered at any given moment ?
[02:03:54] <MJCDoffice> thats the example we're using, yeah
[02:04:01] <Cork> modalInput points to that library
[02:04:03] <MJCDoffice> with the messed up button
[02:04:10] <Cork> so you are using jquery tools
[02:04:29] <MJCDoffice> how strange
[02:04:30] <Cork> so don't blame jquery for there structure
[02:04:35] <MJCDoffice> maybe they built it in with the build tools
[02:04:40] <MJCDoffice> because im sure not loading it
[02:04:45] <MJCDoffice> well, as far as I can see
[02:04:51] <MJCDoffice> its not my project so I wouldn't know
[02:04:58] <Cork> none of jquery, jquery ui or jquery mobile depend on jquery tools
[02:05:14] <Cork> the relation is jquery mobile depends on jquery and jquery ui
[02:05:19] <Cork> and jquery ui depends on jquery
[02:05:23] <Cork> no other dependencies
[02:05:35] <Cork> (well except for sizzle, but that is built into jquery)
[02:05:37] <MJCDoffice> jquery.SPServices-2013.01.min.js
[02:05:42] <MJCDoffice> thats the only other library loaded
[02:05:50] <MJCDoffice> I mean the css im using does have a .modal class
[02:05:56] <Cork> well like you just stated, you are using tools
[02:06:01] <MJCDoffice> but no visibility setting or display:
[02:06:09] <Cork> and none of the default libraries bundles it
[02:06:36] <MJCDoffice> lol I stated I dont know, but cant see it being loaded, just that, regular jquery
[02:06:37] <MJCDoffice> and jquery.mobile-1.1.0.min.css
[02:06:44] <billyonecan> hi everyone, i was wondering if anybody could help me with an issue i'm having with jquery mobile swipe events in ios7: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19164002/erratic-behaviour-of-jquery-mobile-swipe-events-in-ios7
[02:06:52] <Cork> MJCDoffice: i can try help if you ask specific question; but i know very little about jquery tools
[02:07:24] <MJCDoffice> well its just this example, but we're trying to have the modal trigger when we click an anchor, not a button
[02:07:29] <MJCDoffice> I guess I can try rel="..."
[02:07:41] <MJCDoffice> but im really not sure how or why that works on the button in the example you posted
[02:08:34] <Cork> MJCDoffice: from the page it looks like you should have a ar triggers = $(".modalInput").overlay( call somewhere
[02:08:42] <Cork> ar==ah
[02:08:47] <MJCDoffice> yeah but isn't that just for the backdrop?
[02:08:55] <MJCDoffice> I dont see any mention of the actual modal itself in there
[02:08:58] <Cork> not sure, don't think so
[02:09:11] <Cork> nope
[02:09:14] <Cork> "First we enable those trigger elements to open our dialogs."
[02:09:19] <Cork> so that is what makes the connection
[02:09:28] <MJCDoffice> but it just sets some 'mask' properties
[02:09:38] <Cork> well you call the overlay function
[02:09:48] <MJCDoffice> ok ill give it a gooo
[02:10:18] <Cork> MJCDoffice: but dig into the tools documentation, you should be able to find what happens there
[02:12:42] <MJCDoffice> ive got to run im going to put my friend on here just incase he needs anything
[02:12:43] <Ububegin> I have some data... how do i spit out that data as a csv so user can download it
[02:12:46] <MJCDoffice> thanks for your time
[02:12:53] <MJCDoffice> hes not as experienced as me so go easy heh
[02:13:29] <Cork> Ububegin: there isn't anything pre built to generate csv in js
[02:15:22] <Ububegin> Cork: is this the process.. I have a var str='a1,b1,c1\n,a2,b2,c2'; ... and users upon clicking a download button , can get this str variable to put inside a file and passed to them..
[02:15:57] <lite_> whats the difference between .on() and .bind() ?
[02:16:06] <Cork> Ububegin: there is really new browser implementations that let you create downloads locally
[02:16:20] <Cork> Ububegin: but you most likely want to have a fallback that goes over the server
[02:16:33] <Cork> lite_: on is a combination function for bind and delegate
[02:16:54] <Ububegin> Cork: Oh, so I have to make a ajax call to retrieve the csv file...
[02:16:57] <Cork> lite_: so to answer the question; the difference is that on has a syntax for delegate too
[02:17:05] <Cork> Ububegin: not ajax
[02:17:15] <Cork> you can't trigger a download through ajax
[02:17:37] <Ububegin> Cork: hmm, I have always used ajax liberally as I dont want a page reload to happen
[02:18:17] <Cork> Ububegin: unless the server sends back an error (4xx, 5xx) it won't replace the current page
[02:20:09] <Ububegin> Cork: so i have to serve the file from the controller..
[02:20:29] <lite_> thanks Cork
[02:20:30] <Cork> Ububegin: it depends on how much browser support you feel you must have
[02:20:51] <Cork> Ububegin: newer browser allows you to generate data uris and use that for a download source
[02:21:32] <Ububegin> Cork: hmm, I think i will stick with server then.. I will ask the guys in #playframework channel then
[02:25:27] <Deas> http://pastebin.com/iv3LcPbR anyone ?
[02:26:19] <Cork> Deas: wrong channel
[02:26:23] <Cork> you want ##php
[02:27:55] <Deas> Cork: i'm aware of that, i posted that there too, just thought that peps here at #jquery might know php too.
[02:28:15] <Cork> Deas: 1. please only ask in one channel at a time
[02:28:20] <Cork> don't dubble post
[02:28:33] <Deas> Cork: ;p
[02:28:34] <Cork> 2. ask in the channel that matches the subject of the question
[02:28:43] <Ububegin> Cork: just found some solution... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4639372/export-to-csv-in-jquery
[02:28:44] <Cork> there isn't one single line of jquery in that pb
[02:28:57] <Ububegin> Cork: Is it similar to waht you mentioned
[02:29:39] <Cork> Ububegin: ya, that is the data uri solution
[02:31:28] <billyonecan> can anyone help me with this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19164002/erratic-behaviour-of-jquery-mobile-swipe-events-in-ios7
[02:35:01] <_oiseaux> Hey all, when I'm calling a method on an element, is there much practical difference between say $("div ol li").mymethod() and $("ol li", mydiv).mymethod() where mydiv is something like $("div")
[02:35:14] <_oiseaux> If you see what I mean, using the context argument rather than just a straight up selector
[02:36:33] <Cork> _oiseaux: the second one is a bit faster
[02:36:53] <_oiseaux> Cork: So one could benefit if the DOM was particular large/dense, perhaps
[02:37:05] <Cork> _oiseaux: cause it doesn't traverse the entire dom
[02:37:37] <Cork> _oiseaux: yes, also you might want to use classes or id's as that means the browser doesn't have to traverse the dom to find the element
[02:37:53] <Cork> _oiseaux: though the size of the section to search matters for if that matters
[02:44:03] <xxtjaxx> Hi! Anybody from the Miso Project around? Or sufficient in d3.chart?
[02:46:53] <lite_> is there any way to find out "who" triggered a certain event?
[02:47:07] <xxtjaxx> lite_: e.target
[02:48:05] <xxtjaxx> lite_: target property gives you the element that caused the event to fire.
[02:48:12] <lite_> thanks
[02:51:04] <_oiseaux> Cork: thankyou
[02:51:19] <xxtjaxx> http://paste.debian.net/50153/ < This is the data and the graph tasked with drawing it. POI is a selected key from the dataset. This is all hooked up to an angular app. Each time a key is selected I want to add it to the of things to draw. but each time it adds a bar without recalculating the rest any ideas?
[03:01:09] <Timmy911lolz> Hey all, I'm trying to replace a javascript 'prompt' input with,  what I believe is called,  a jquery 'modal' input/dialog. Total noob and totally lost, can anyone point me in the right direction?
[03:01:55] <shafox> hi i have a json object, how can i access each key to show their value in frontend ?http://pastebin.ws/flrjwy
[03:03:36] <Cork> ?g jquery ui dialog
[03:03:36] <b-ot> Cork: Dialog | jQuery UI → http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[03:03:40] <Cork> Timmy911lolz: ^
[03:04:03] <Cork> ?api jquery.each @ shafox
[03:04:03] <b-ot> shafox: jQuery.each(): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[03:04:48] <shafox> Cork: I receive that json object in a variable lets say result. i want to access the property name and id from that object.
[03:05:12] <Cork> result.property_name
[03:05:19] <shafox> Cork: if i do result.id or result.name it gives me undefined
[03:05:22] <Cork> or if you want to loop over it use what i just linked to
[03:05:42] <Cork> shafox: fix your server to send the correct mimetype for json
[03:05:47] <Cork> application/json
[03:06:03] <Cork> (instead of text/html)
[03:07:25] <Timmy911lolz> Thanks cork - I'll have aplay around with that
[03:07:29] <shafox> Cork: The type is text/html but i am getting the json object in the response tab.
[03:07:51] <Cork> shafox: yes, but the browser doens't know it is json cause you tell it is html
[03:08:10] <Cork> so fix the server to tell the truth and things will just work
[03:08:26] <shafox> ahh ok . thanks Cork
[03:10:06] <shafox> Cork:  thanks Worked. just had to set the content type in my php controller before sending out the data :)
[03:27:36] <wild_oscar> if someTr.find('td') gets me all the <td> in that tr...what is the best way to get "an array, with each element being the html contained on each row?
[03:28:16] <wild_oscar> anything smarter than someTr.find('td').each ( add iteratedElement.html() to an array variable)
[03:28:17] <wild_oscar> ?
[03:29:34] <Cork> wild_oscar: someTr.html()
[03:30:13] <wild_oscar> Cork: that gets me the html, not an array of td html contents
[03:30:41] <Cork> ah
[03:31:18] <Cork> $.map(someTr.children(), function(elm) { return elm.innerHTML; });
[03:37:24] <wild_oscar> cheers, let me try that in a sec
[04:10:38] <ripthejacker> how can I convert an array to a set.
[04:10:50] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/5ZDE2/ <-- how can I do this in a "smart" and quick way?`
[04:10:51] <ripthejacker> Or how do I check if all the elements in the array are same.
[04:16:18] <ripthejacker> Or how do I check if all the elements in the array are same.
[04:18:33] <ripthejacker> ok gotit $.unique
[04:18:33] <DRSK> .not( '.top, .right, .bottom, .left' ).addClass( defaultPos ); seems to be working
[04:24:06] <Cork> ripthejacker: that only works for dom elements though
[04:24:51] <ripthejacker> yeah I saw that.
[04:25:11] <ripthejacker> any other way to know if an array has same elements?
[04:26:08] <Cork> as in same what string?
[04:26:10] <Cork> object?
[04:28:05] <lite_> i know the element triggering my event is class='foo'(among other classes). so how come, in $('body').on('barEv', ".foo" fooFunc), fooFunc isnt called? ?
[04:28:15] <ripthejacker> Cork: yes same string
[04:28:36] <Cork> lite_: are you sure the event bubbles?
[04:28:45] <Cork> ripthejacker: $.grep would do the job then
[04:28:53] <Cork> ?api jquery.grep
[04:28:54] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.grep(): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[04:28:58] <lite_> Cork: how do I make sure that it is ?
[04:29:11] <Cork> lite_: how is the event triggered?
[04:29:53] <ripthejacker> Cork: how can it help. Somehow the $.unique is working for my array of strings.
[04:30:01] <lite_> Cork: $target.trigger("barEv"); in updateSucceded() - A method called on succesful ajax calls
[04:30:09] <lite_> ajax requests*
[04:30:13] <Cork> lite_: then it should bubble
[04:30:25] <Cork> lite_: if you remove the selector does the event fire?
[04:30:29] <lite_> yup
[04:32:06] <Cork> ripthejacker: loop over the array and check though inArray if it exists in the array already
[04:32:47] <lite_> Cork: and e.target is : <div class='foo bar foofoo' ....></div>
[04:33:01] <Cork> interesting
[04:33:18] <Cork> and by $('body').on('barEv', ".foo" fooFunc) you meant $('body').on('barEv', ".foo", fooFunc) ?
[04:33:46] <ripthejacker> I made an array from the map( $('td'),func{ $(this).text())}
[04:34:06] <ripthejacker> a = map( $('td'),func{ $(this).text())}
[04:34:15] <ripthejacker> and then makearray(a)
[04:34:16] <Cork> and the different td elements can contain the same text?
[04:34:23] <ripthejacker> yes
[04:34:31] <Cork> ripthejacker: no need to use makearray if you use $.
[04:34:36] <Cork> it already returns a real array
[04:34:43] <Cork> uh
[04:34:46] <Cork> $.map
[04:34:50] <ripthejacker> I tried but it is an object
[04:35:12] <Cork> your sure?
[04:35:12] <ripthejacker> actually I need to do .trim that's why used map
[04:35:23] <ripthejacker> yes
[04:35:41] <ripthejacker> It's working, now that I've used makearray
[04:35:58] <ripthejacker> but somehow $.unique is also working
[04:35:58] <lite_> Cork: yes
[04:37:46] <Cork> ripthejacker: http://jsfiddle.net/jLY8U/
[04:38:35] <Cork> lite_: not sure then, that should work
[04:38:52] <Cork> lite_: do you have any event listeners in the tree that does return false?
[04:38:54] <ThemNuts> hi guys, i can't get this jquery autocomplete to work. i get the data from json but the suggestionlist doesn't show
[04:38:56] <ThemNuts> http://pastebin.com/72maqmNh
[04:39:07] <lite_> Cork. wait a second i think i may have made a retarded mistake
[04:39:40] <Cork> ThemNuts: the autocomplete doens't work like that
[04:39:59] <Cork> ThemNuts: response expects to be called with an array of options for the dropdown
[04:40:54] <ThemNuts> and then how do i populate different input fields with values?
[04:41:40] <Cork> you do that in select not source
[04:41:57] <Cork> also you can give the url to source instead of doing the call your self
[04:42:28] <Cork> ThemNuts: read the examples and the documentation
[04:42:35] <wild_oscar> is there a preferable approach between: 1) having javascript conditionally add some html code to the page and 2)having the content there, but hidden, and have javascript toggle the hide status?
[04:42:38] <Cork> it explains how the callbacks work really well
[04:42:57] <ThemNuts> yeah did that already and works with regular input, but as soon as i want to populate a city input i get stuck
[04:43:11] <Cork> wild_oscar: normally the prefered option is to have it there (visible) and hide it with js on load
[04:43:17] <Cork> wild_oscar: and then show it when you want to
[04:43:25] <Cork> wild_oscar: that way the content is readable even without js
[04:44:03] <wild_oscar> Cork: doesn't that cause loading rendering  problems - the kind where you briefly see the wrong content?
[04:44:21] <Cork> ThemNuts: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#multiple-remote
[04:44:32] <Cork> ThemNuts: except you want to set two fields instead of the this.join
[04:44:40] <doug65536> wild_oscar: it does if you follow the poor advice of having your scripts load at the bottom of the page
[04:44:43] <Cork> wild_oscar: not if you do it in ready
[04:45:25] <ripthejacker> Cork:Oh yes it's working now. Wonder what was the problem when I tried it first.
[04:45:29] <ripthejacker> Thanks :)
[04:45:46] <wild_oscar> doug65536: is it poor advice? I actually bought a theme on themeforest where I saw that for the first time - some scripts loaded on top, some on bottom
[04:46:01] <wild_oscar> and I thought it was an interesting concept
[04:46:30] <Cork> the script loaded at bottom is running similarly as ready
[04:47:00] <Cork> and it should be early enough to actually prevent the flickering
[04:47:11] <Cork> though the browser doesn't guarantee it as if you use the ready callback
[04:47:48] <lite_> im having some difficulties wrapping my head around this. why is it that i cant simply set my listener on the element itself rather than having to use a selector? What I mean is why does $('body').on('fooEv', ".fooBar", barFunc) work but $('.fooBar').on('fooEv', barFunc) doesnt ?
[04:47:51] <doug65536> wild_oscar: inexperienced devs that are obsessed with every last millisecond want the page to draw a split second earlier, loading at the bottom causes it to show content before your code has run. if you load in head you can initialize before the page is visible
[04:48:26] <Cork> lite_: the first one adds the listener to body, and listens for bubbling events from .fooBar
[04:48:43] <Cork> lite_: while the second one adds it to .fooBar directly (if it exists)
[04:49:06] <lite_> aah. so if .fooBar doesnt exist when i initially add the listener im fucked
[04:49:10] <Cork> lite_: that means the second one adds one event listener per element, and only works for element that exists when the selector runs
[04:49:13] <lite_> on the second one
[04:49:22] <dereuromark> hello. i have a select2 jquery plugin question. if someone is able to help pretty quick
[04:49:40] <Cork> lite_: while the first one adds one listener to body, and it will work for all element matching that selector as long as the event bubbles
[04:50:17] <Cork> doug65536: actually that isn't really true
[04:50:38] <doug65536> Cork: I knew you were going to say that
[04:50:42] <Cork> doug65536: you can get quite a big difference from moving scripts out of head
[04:50:51] <doug65536> Cork: you don't like me do you
[04:51:17] <Cork> doug65536: i only don't like when you say something that isn't true
[04:51:26] <Cork> big scripts in head delays first draw of the page
[04:51:40] <doug65536> how many milliseconds is "quite a difference". 80ms? 120ms?
[04:51:44] <Cork> and that can be for up to 2-3 sec if you have a log of scripts on slow nodes
[04:51:56] <Cork> *a lot
[04:52:21] <doug65536> yeah, well, on "slow nodes", the place that scripts load is the least of your worries
[04:52:42] <screamingbanshee> nuh uh
[04:53:02] <Cork> hack i've seen pages that has scripts for adds and tracking (dbclick) that delays the first draw for ages cause the node doesn't respond
[04:53:06] <screamingbanshee> latency has a way of snowballing
[04:53:15] <Cork> so the page doesn't draw cause the third party is down
[04:53:27] <Cork> so it isn't as simple as a few ms
[04:53:32] <doug65536> exactly, which is why you don't use a CDN
[04:53:33] <dereuromark> http://hastebin.com/wujagafufo.vhdl => I would like to show the last search again if one selected/clicked the wrong search result. currently it is always resetted on reopen
[04:53:40] <Cork> heh....
[04:54:04] <Cork> doug65536: it depends on the load and how distributed the users are if you need to
[04:54:36] <Cork> and adnetworks and similar usually forces you to load scripts from third party
[04:54:54] <doug65536> cdn is an advertising scam to track people's browsing habits. the client has to connect to the cdn every time so what do you gain?
[04:55:07] <Cork> uh...
[04:55:30] <Cork> that's so wrong on so many areas that i'm not even sure where to start...
[04:55:56] <doug65536> ah, yeah, they run the CDNs out of the goodness of their heart
[04:56:07] <doug65536> gives them a warm feeling inside with hundreds of thousands of requests coming in
[04:56:14] <Cork> doug65536: your talking about the free cdn's now
[04:56:21] <Cork> there are payed ones too
[04:56:26] <Cork> heck we run some here
[04:56:32] <Cork> and take good bucks for it
[04:56:43] <screamingbanshee> hrm. so, what if you're using something a little more complex. Like haproxy between server instances on nodes across multiple regions with internal calls between interconnected systems in a polyglot environment requesting resource creation that may or may not exist yet? what happens to failovers and catchalls when latency pushes on them? etc.
[04:58:14] <screamingbanshee> and if your load spike is around two million requests?
[04:58:59] <doug65536> screamingbanshee: cool story bro
[04:59:08] * screamingbanshee not a bro but ok
[05:03:10] <ThemNuts> Cork: i took the example you showed me but now i can't even see my json data in firebug.. http://pastebin.com/RkByrDuX
[05:03:31] <dereuromark> any quick hints on how to resolve this? thx
[05:03:59] <screamingbanshee> dereuromark cake?
[05:04:22] <Cork> ThemNuts: you can replace $("#autocomplete").val() with request it is the same thing
[05:04:39] <dereuromark> screamingbanshee: the backend yes, frontent not so much :)
[05:05:01] <Cork> ThemNuts: you arn't giving the response to autocomplete
[05:05:14] <screamingbanshee> I'll msg
[05:05:34] <Cork> ThemNuts: also and like i said; source: "<?php echo site_url('autocomplete/suggestions'); ?>", should do the same thing
[05:06:12] <ThemNuts> without the entire ajax bit?
[05:09:17] <shafox> Cork: I am using $.each as you suggested to loop through the array of object in the json object , but the console log in jsfiddle works fine, but while implemennting the same its not showing up all the results in a list format here is the code for reference . http://pastebin.ws/am2qs  v
[05:09:19] <shafox> http://jsfiddle.net/PYZ7R/
[05:10:31] <Cork> shafox: i don't follow what isn't working?
[05:10:35] <Cork> -?
[05:11:00] <Cork> shafox: is the jsfiddle what should happen or what is wrong with it?
[05:11:38] <Cork> shafox: also you most likely want append, not html
[05:11:53] <shafox> Cork: How to show all the results in a list? jsfiddle is happening in the application, but i want to do like this one a several result came it will show in a list one result per list.
[05:11:55] <Cork> as it will replace the everything in #results each itteration
[05:12:12] <Cork> shafox: side note, don't use tagnames infront of your id's
[05:12:25] <Cork> (why is so many ppl doing this...)
[05:12:59] <shafox> kinda followed someone code hence...
[05:13:16] <shafox> Cork: Thanks for that append tip
[05:13:17] <shafox> :)
[05:13:23] <Cork> shafox: that selector means find all ul's in the page
[05:13:46] <Cork> from that match pick out the specific element that matches the unique id
[05:13:46] <shafox> and then it will look for id named whatever
[05:13:51] <shafox> yes
[05:21:12] <ThemNuts> Cork: so now i add the response but it still doesnt' give me te json data in firebug or show me the suggestionlist. Rly sorry but not good with jquery at all
[05:21:13] <ThemNuts> http://pastebin.com/1b0KXNBJ
[05:21:48] <Cork> ThemNuts: have you even tried the simple approach?
[05:22:03] <ThemNuts> i did and that worked fine
[05:22:16] <ThemNuts> i get the dropbox and can select and the input is polulated.
[05:22:17] <Cork> so why do you need to use the function call?
[05:22:59] <ThemNuts> what function call? of the response?
[05:23:04] <Cork> source
[05:23:14] <Cork> just give it the url and let the default request handle it
[05:23:32] <Cork> i've asked this three times now...
[05:27:27] <ThemNuts> Like this http://pastebin.com/AcY2maru ?
[05:28:06] <Cork> yes
[05:28:29] <Cork> it would make a get request instead of a post request
[05:28:41] <Cork> but as you arn't updating anything it should be a get request either way
[05:28:45] <ThemNuts> nah can't do that since i use CodeIgniter
[05:28:56] <Cork> ok?
[05:30:45] <ThemNuts> it doesn't use GET, only post
[05:31:22] <t432> any jquery nonjas about?
[05:31:26] <t432> ninjas*
[05:31:37] <grafi> they are, but you cant see them
[05:33:22] <Cork> ThemNuts: that's... weird...
[05:33:25] <t432> I been messing with this (on and off) since last night - http://pastebin.com/Ti0amfE2
[05:33:48] <Cork> ThemNuts: that means you can't ever use the browsers cache...
[05:34:06] <ThemNuts> codeigniter has cache options of its own
[05:35:38] <screamingbanshee> cork, how are you so patient? you're like a saint
[05:37:15] <Cork> screamingbanshee: donno, don't find it that hard
[05:37:17] <ThemNuts> agreed..
[05:37:37] <ThemNuts> enough that i'm frustrated with this, last thing i want is to frustrate other people
[05:37:38] <screamingbanshee> cork I think I've only ever seen you get irritated once
[05:37:40] <ThemNuts> sorry
[05:37:42] <Cork> when i do i just drop it and someone else have to take over
[05:38:05] <Cork> that's one of the reason why i don't want ppl in pm'
[05:38:08] <Cork> +s
[05:38:34] <screamingbanshee> lol because you'd get COMPLETELY DOGPILED CONSTANTLY
[05:38:39] <screamingbanshee> in caps
[05:39:45] <screamingbanshee> themnuts, what cork is saying is CI's caching options are only accessible to the server. the browser can't leverage them.
[05:39:51] <MJCD> Cork: I appreciate you helping my coworker earlier
[05:40:05] <MJCD> we'll see what he came up with based on that advice on Monday I guess lol!
[05:40:10] <Cork> ah, i meant that post is never cached by the browser
[05:40:24] <Cork> or rather the only request that is cached is get
[05:40:46] <Cork> post/patch/put/options and so on are all without cache
[05:41:10] <Cork> MJCD: heh, yw
[05:41:37] <Cork> ThemNuts: if you need post, i don't see anything wrong with http://pastebin.com/1b0KXNBJ
[05:41:51] <Cork> that should work just fine
[05:42:14] <Tomashe> hey guys, wondering something, i want to create a script that when u write to a specific input text it will calcular thing and show them on input text2
[05:42:55] <Cork> Tomashe: bind an input event on the first field
[05:43:02] <ThemNuts> Cork: that doesn't fire the ajax. firebug doesn't show the request and no data
[05:43:21] <Cork> ThemNuts: and no errors in the console?
[05:43:55] <Tomashe> hmm
[05:44:01] <Cork> ThemNuts: btw another side note; i recommend using json_encode instead of echo in a js string
[05:44:03] <Tomashe> how do i do it , can show me an example?
[05:44:08] <Cork> as that might give you escape problems
[05:44:32] <Cork> Tomashe: $('#field1').on('input', function() {  })
[05:45:22] <Tomashe> hmm
[05:45:26] <Tomashe> ok let me try that
[06:01:30] <shafox> how to remove previously called results from jquery ajax. i want to show updated result everytime the value changes ?
[06:04:16] <ThemNuts> i think i'm almost there. I get the right data and a suggestionlist shows but its empty. http://pastebin.com/Fi0pJZeT The $("#autocomplete").val() needs to stay or i get term[term]= "900";
[06:05:27] <Cork> shafox: cache: false in the ajax call
[06:05:45] <shafox> Cork: done but still showing
[06:05:59] <Cork> shafox: what is showing?
[06:06:42] <shafox> Cork: Here is the live example. http://linkmysport.com/beta/event/index/public/eventid/4
[06:07:02] <shafox> try to search something in the search bar and you will notice it repeats the results
[06:07:09] <shafox> Cork: ^^
[06:08:23] <Cork> shafox: simplest is prob to add the new li's to an array first (.push())
[06:08:30] <Cork> and then use html() on that array
[06:08:45] <Cork> that way you replace everything that was there before with everything you have now
[06:09:24] <shafox> COrkso first something like this .push(list).html(list) ???
[06:09:37] <shafox> Cork: ^^
[06:09:45] <Cork> $("#results").html($.map(result, function(arrayId, teams) { return '<li><a href="team/index/index/teamid/'+teams.id+'"><h5>'+teams.name+'</h5></a></li>';
[06:09:55] <Cork> opps
[06:10:09] <Cork> $("#results").html($.map(result, function(arrayId, teams) { return '<li><a href="team/index/index/teamid/'+teams.id+'"><h5>'+teams.name+'</h5></a></li>'; }).join(''));
[06:11:06] <Cork> shafox: you need to move arrayId, and teams
[06:11:15] <Cork> $.map has the oposite order from each
[06:11:25] <Cork> $("#results").html($.map(result, function(teams, arrayId) { return '<li><a href="team/index/index/teamid/'+teams.id+'"><h5>'+teams.name+'</h5></a></li>'; }).join(''));

[06:14:21] <Cork> just look in there
[06:14:51] <horse> i have a "basic" put anoying problem and i wonder if one of you can help.  i want to launch a modal pop up from a button, ie:  <a href="#popup" class="btn btn-success">Create</a>
[06:14:54] <horse> all works ok
[06:15:13] <horse> but.. how the hell do i point to this if the modal is on another page?
[06:15:23] <podman99> Any code for jquery creating HTML form elements or simply .html(FIELD HERE)
[06:15:43] <horse> ie: <a href="my_other_page.php#windowTitleDialog" class="btn btn-success">Create</a>
[06:16:27] <horse> the above donst work, can someone please tell me what im doing wrong, or where to look?  i want to split my modal pop up code from the rest of the page
[06:16:45] <Cork> horse: that is how you would do it, if it works depends on the landing page
[06:17:00] <horse> thanks Cork
[06:17:46] <joland9> instead of using a tag like <div id="output"></div> what would be the way to get the actual code there
[06:17:48] <Cork> horse: the landing page would have to handle if the url has a hash when the page loads
[06:18:11] <horse> i dont think i follow?
[06:18:12] <Cork> horse: either through css (the way i would do it) or through .ready and window.location.hash
[06:19:00] <horse> so at the moment my other page (with the modal) just has a large button on it, that when pressed launches the modal
[06:19:29] <Cork> horse: you can't trigger events on a page after your page has been unloaded
[06:19:32] <horse> i dont want a button that links to another page with a button, i just want the modal to launch if you see what i mean
[06:19:40] <horse> ah ok
[06:19:57] <Cork> horse: so the second page would have to detect that the hash was there and do the right thing
[06:20:06] <Cork> horse: css has :target
[06:20:18] <Cork> horse: so the css could just make the elements visible by default
[06:20:40] <Cork> it would be positive from a second reason, that it would work without js too on the page
[06:21:35] <ThemNuts> Cork: i figured out that the succes is the problem because of the multiple values. it shows a suggestionlist but its empty. tried mapping the data http://pastebin.com/D5DRdFJh
[06:21:55] <Cork> ah
[06:22:24] <Cork> ya, i usually do that server side
[06:23:13] <Tomashe> $('select[name="currency"]').on("change",function() {	console.log($(this).attr("rate"),1); < why this giving me undefined ?
[06:24:02] <Cork> why would rate give you anything?
[06:24:25] <Cork> if that is a custom attribute be user to use data-rate
[06:24:34] <Cork> *be sure to use
[06:24:53] <Tomashe> cuz i added inside the option rate="1.2"
[06:24:58] <Tomashe> so it should giv eme
[06:25:05] <Cork> if that is a custom attribute be user to use data-rate <--
[06:25:16] <Tomashe> ok i changed it to data rate
[06:25:20] <Tomashe> and now it should work ?
[06:25:31] <Tomashe> $(this).attr("data-rate")
[06:25:36] <Cork> well that isn't the source of the problem
[06:25:42] <Cork> this is the select element, not the option
[06:25:54] <Tomashe> ohh ok, so how do i choose the optiong then?
[06:26:12] <Cork> so you would have to do $(this).find('option:selected').first().attr('rate')
[06:26:23] <Tomashe> hmm
[06:26:26] <Tomashe> why need the first ?
[06:26:39] <Cork> in case you use multiselect :)
[06:26:45] <Cork> oh, wait sorry
[06:26:48] <Cork> attr does that by default
[06:26:53] <Cork> so ya, you can skip first()
[06:27:06] <under> Hello. I'm new at web dev, here's my website ( http://gdera.co/ ), it doesn't fit for mobile devices. why?
[06:27:20] <Tomashe> ok great, now its working

[07:13:18] <t3ch> Hello everyone, I'm generating the following highchart with jquery and injecting it into the head of my document with an onclick / ajax request... it runs on jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Yrygy/70/, but will not load after successfully being inserted into the head of the document, as described here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19171406/ajax-request-to-insert-highcharts-into-head-and-run-function
[07:13:40] <t3ch> any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
[07:24:04] <pu239> i'm new to jquery, i have a list with checkboxes, when i select the parent i want to select all of the children also
[07:24:31] <pu239> should this give me the children - $("input[name='parentcheckbox']").children();
[07:24:32] <pu239> ?
[07:24:50] <BillCriswell> pu239, Yup.
[07:25:06] <Quest> how do make this menu appear on click on a div ? http://jqueryui.com/menu/#icons
[07:25:07] <BillCriswell> Why does this put a comma after an auto completed nickname...
[07:25:09] <pu239> hmm, i'm not getting anything back
[07:25:27] <BillCriswell> pu239, If you have children of a checkbox something is seriously up.
[07:25:36] <BillCriswell> pu239, You sure you don't want the siblings?
[07:26:00] <grafi> BillCriswell because thats cool ^^
[07:26:10] <pu239> BillCriswell, doh!
[07:26:19] <pu239> yes, that's what i want

[07:27:12] <grafi> what do I know
[07:27:14] <BillCriswell> pu239, .siblings() should do the trick?
[07:27:22] <BillCriswell> grafi, I thought there would be a way to find out.
[07:27:28] <grafi> probably
[07:27:33] <grafi> im not smart enough though :P
[07:27:59] <BillCriswell> Me either... must be around somewhere.
[07:28:04] <grafi> I always use .doWhatIWant()
[07:28:11] <grafi> it always does what I want
[07:28:21] <grafi> 20k loc of magic xD
[07:28:30] <pu239> would it be $("input[name='parentcheckbox']").siblings(':checkbox');
[07:28:59] <grafi> looks about left
[07:29:30] <BillCriswell> pu239, If you want the sibling checkboxes I think that's right.

[07:32:18] <BillCriswell> pu239, No problem!
[07:34:51] <t3ch> BillCriswell: Highcharts is included after jquery, as is the billajax.js file that calls the request.   This was my initial post with examples of what is happening.

[07:35:40] <t3ch> BillCriswell, I have a similar example that works fine on another page, when replicating it, it isn't working.
[07:36:02] <BillCriswell> t3ch, Too specific for me to look at right now.
[07:36:13] <grafi> "being inserted" seems like the problem point
[07:36:43] <t3ch> if I copy the code that is generated and appended in the head of the document, the same error is thrown.
[07:36:56] <grafi> cool
[07:37:12] <grafi> wheres the generated code?
[07:37:25] <grafi> ah i found it
[07:37:31] <billyonecan> can anyone help me with this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19164002/erratic-behaviour-of-jquery-mobile-swipe-events-in-ios7
[07:38:34] <t3ch> grafi, I load the page without initiating the ajax request, and I just insert the code into the console of chrome and hit enter, the same error is thrown.
[07:39:12] <t3ch> HandleResponse4 billajax.js:323
[07:39:15] <t3ch> xmlHttp2.onreadystatechange billajax.js:218
[07:39:33] <t3ch> those are the errors, but it doesn't seem to make any sense.
[07:40:06] <grafi> yeah, strange
[07:40:23] <t3ch> if the script with an id of votescode already exists, HandleResponse4 is thrown.  if it doesn't exist, HandleResponse3 is thrown.
[07:40:54] <t3ch> at this point, i've stripped all unnecessary code out of the document, and widdled it down to the object object 'highcharts' error.
[07:43:30] <t3ch> I figured it out.
[07:43:47] <t3ch> jquery was included in the body of a page as well as the head of the document.
[07:43:51] <t3ch> stripping it out changed it.
[07:44:29] <t3ch> why is javascript so picky, and what tools exist to better understand what errors are happening?
[07:44:32] <t3ch> any advice?
[07:47:45] <grafi> well i suppose if you are including juery, then adding the plugin and then including a new jquery, the plugin is just not there anymore ... thats not really surprising to me

[08:56:06] <ChaZ> can someone give me a hint on how to refresh/reload a getJson after a link is clicked?
[08:56:42] <duch_kazatel> like fetch it again?
[08:57:53] <ChaZ> yeap
[08:58:12] <duch_kazatel> put your getJson call in a function then ref the function any time you want to to download content.
[08:58:50] <ChaZ> Wow... stupid me. I really didn't think of that! Tanks!
[09:00:43] <amcsi_work> what's the quickest way to find out whether a jquery object is empty or not? if (jqObj.length)? if (jqObj[0])? something else?
[09:00:44] <duch_kazatel> Rubber duck problem solving ;)
[09:01:03] <duch_kazatel> amcsi_work i check .length and see if it's greater than 0.
[09:04:18] <ChaZ> duch_kazatel, one more thing: when using $.ajax i get only one item from JSON, when using getJson, it returns the whole data. http://jsfiddle.net/dmbostan/ktVU2/
[09:04:37] <ChaZ> is it a problem with my code?
[09:05:35] <duch_kazatel> why are you runnind a .each?

[09:06:59] <duch_kazatel> that should work
[09:15:19] <gregf_> hi, i'm new to ajax :/
[09:15:25] <gregf_> the scenario i have is:
[09:16:22] <dieguezz> [jop008] with .text?hi, i got a dropdown value multiplied for an input number. The problem is that depending on the order i choose the number or the dropdown, i get NaN or it doesnt update correctly when one of both fields change: http://jsfiddle.net/8R26P/6/#&togetherjs=HxxuJQNf0v
[09:16:44] <dieguezz> sorry jop008 that wasnt for u
[09:17:23] <gregf_> i've got a form with a button which the user clicks. this opens a new window and make a POST to a webservice. the user is then provided with a interactive form and clicks accept which sends a response. i take the response. parse it and put it into the DB. now from the original page i needed to write an ajax GET which returns to me json.
[09:23:40] <gregf_> or to put it another way: i have a form and from the form i needed to make a n ajax request after say 5 seconds(to a script which hits the db) and checks if the data is loaded into a specific table. is this possible please?
[09:24:19] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ do you have a server-side setup?
[09:24:49] <gregf_> duch_kazatel:yep i need to call a script on the server
[09:25:01] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ so the server portion is all ready done?
[09:25:18] <gregf_> well its a sample script i have from which i return json
[09:25:36] <gregf_> so yes, its there
[09:25:50] <duch_kazatel> okay.  so then use the jquery $.ajax() method to run your ajax.
[09:26:20] <duch_kazatel> not sure what youre stuck on.  do you have some sample code?
[09:26:51] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: i mean i need to make the request only until i know my table is populated with the data and then stop
[09:27:53] <gregf_> duch_kazatel:my actual server is : http://localhost:3001/. now, using ajax would i be able to call a script like https://secure.server/myscript.pl ?
[09:28:06] <gregf_> or would that be a cross site request?
[09:28:51] <duch_kazatel> aaaah your issue is Cross-domain.  that won't float unless you do jsonp
[09:29:09] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067472/what-is-jsonp-all-about
[09:29:17] <duch_kazatel> or you look at how to securely do just that.
[09:29:44] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: so its possible with jsonp huh?
[09:30:13] <gregf_> i can hit the same server though :)
[09:30:48] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: let me try something. thank you very much!
[09:38:15] <fission6> how do i insert a <Script> element to another element
[09:38:24] <fission6> it does't like var $tag_template = $('<div class="tag-example"><script src="" type="text/javascript"></script></div>');
[09:45:47] <fission6> how do i execute javascript being returned from fetching a <Script>
[09:52:46] <fission6> how do i fetch scripts which have document.write in them and execute
[09:52:47] <fission6> ?
[09:53:50] <Jon47> fission6: i can't answer that question but I can advise you to avoid document.write if at all possible
[09:54:02] <fission6> its not mine to control
[09:54:15] <Jon47> fission6: if you inject a script into the DOM it will execute
[09:54:15] <NoiseEee> fission6: just curious what you've googled so far.
[09:54:17] <fission6> I'm fetching ad tags and trying to show them in a page, after the page i sloaded
[09:54:23] <NoiseEee> not "load scripts with jquery" i guess
[09:54:49] <Jon47> your code above creates a dom fragment with the script tag
[09:55:06] <Jon47> if you were to append that fragment into the live dom of the webpage, the script would then load and execute
[09:55:07] <fission6> i have an add tag which looks like <script src="whatever"></script> tag has document.write() in it, its getting fetched but not "rendering itself in the dom
[09:55:19] <fission6> its not
[09:55:22] <fission6> its getting it
[09:55:30] <duch_kazatel> fission6 the ad tag is probably targeting something that doesn't exist on the page.
[09:55:35] <Jon47> fission6: if the ad has document.write i would suggest sandboxing it in an iframe
[09:55:56] <fission6> then i need to know the size of it to set the iframe
[09:56:03] <fission6> or can you autsize the frame to set it
[09:56:10] <Jon47> eh, not easily
[09:56:14] <Jon47> you don't know the size of it?
[09:56:33] <duch_kazatel> a lot of ad tags require that you load the init and then put in "placeholders" where you want them to prefer.
[09:56:38] <duch_kazatel> *where you want them to show.
[09:56:55] <fission6> not the case with this
[09:57:03] <fission6> document.write just isn't executing
[09:57:12] <duch_kazatel> fission6 and the console isn't erroring?
[09:57:19] <bberry> noob question alert.  How do i do something like addEventListener but with jquery.  I have tried with this http://jsfiddle.net/jHPjK/  to no avail.  Also, what is the difference between those two implementations?
[09:57:29] <fission6> i append the script element i see chrome fetch it and i see console.log(script_el) print
[09:57:31] <Jon47> i could make a fortune if i made an ad network that promised not to use `document.write`
[09:57:38] <duch_kazatel> bberry use .on();
[09:57:49] <bberry> duch_kazatel: mmk. ill look at it
[09:59:10] <fission6> damn it! its fetching the script when i append, just not executing it
[09:59:42] <duch_kazatel> fission6 is it look for the onload event or something?
[10:00:34] <fission6> nope
[10:01:46] <bberry> duch_kazatel: I used .on(); and it has the same result as the other 2 methods. Is it a problem with using jsfiddle or something? http://jsfiddle.net/jHPjK/1/
[10:02:00] <duch_kazatel> bberry what are you trying to accomplish?
[10:02:21] <bberry> duch_kazatel: in the example, just to get alert windows when you click any of those buttons
[10:03:14] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[10:04:24] <duch_kazatel> oh dude your selectors are wrong.
[10:05:01] <bberry> oh haha. just started jquery.
[10:05:08] <bberry> oh shit
[10:05:11] <bberry> i need the # dont i
[10:05:11] <duch_kazatel> are you familiar with css selectors?
[10:05:14] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[10:05:27] <bberry> yeah. im just an idiot.
[10:05:30] <duch_kazatel> sizzle is a lot like CSS.
[10:06:59] <pu239> how do i get sibling select elements? $("select[name='x']").siblings(?)
[10:07:03] <bberry> duch_kazatel: It still didnt work. but ithink its because i needed to wrap it in a function
[10:07:12] <bberry> because it was just auto-calling the alert function
[10:07:26] <bberry> which makes sense
[10:07:30] <shoky> pu239: .siblings('select')
[10:07:38] <bberry> duch_kazatel: Thx for the help. sorry for my idiocy >.<
[10:07:51] <duch_kazatel> bberry np broseph.  you'll learn :)
[10:08:07] <pu239> shoky, ah, thanks, kept trying ':select'
[10:12:43] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: i've managed to get the response using jsonp
[10:13:20] <gregf_> but it somehow alerts 'WRONG' when i was expecting it to alert('GOOD')
[10:14:25] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ code example?
[10:16:57] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: sure, this is what i have atm:
[10:17:06] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ don't paste in here.
[10:17:11] <duch_kazatel> use jsfiddle
[10:17:45] <gregf_> paste
[10:17:55] <duch_kazatel> `paste
[10:17:55] <gregf_> well, do i need a login :/
[10:17:56] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:18:00] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:18:41] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: could see a paste option :/
[10:18:45] <gregf_> save?
[10:18:53] <gregf_> or run?
[10:19:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:19:06] <gregf_> *could'nt
[10:19:11] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[10:19:28] <duch_kazatel> paste your js into the box that says "javascript", click the "save" link at the top, then send the URL.
[10:19:42] <gregf_> ah - cool :)
[10:20:05] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/m4BnC/
[10:21:07] <gregf_> i can see the response in firebug
[10:21:08] <duch_kazatel> and http://www.secure.com/cgi-bin/fetch_pc_config.pl works when you paste it into a browser?
[10:21:16] <gregf_> it does
[10:21:42] <duch_kazatel> if it's hitting the error alert, then there is an error with the request.
[10:22:14] <gregf_> is there a way to figure out the error. i can see that its a 200
[10:23:27] <duch_kazatel> why are you doing that $.each() on lines 7-8?
[10:24:15] <gregf_> well i need to loop through the json object just to see whats returned. i know i need to use i.property_name?
[10:24:35] <duch_kazatel> you can just do console.log(data)
[10:24:37] <duch_kazatel> and see it.
[10:24:39] <mrcloud> hello. I'm using jquery to toggle a class in an element but although that is working, new css values for properties of old class are ignored. What could be the problem?
[10:26:38] <gregf_> duch_kazatel:sure
[10:27:06] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ in firebug, click the link for the request in the console.
[10:27:16] <gregf_> ok
[10:27:20] <duch_kazatel> then click the "response" tab.
[10:27:24] <duch_kazatel> what do you see there?
[10:27:35] <gregf_> ah - yes
[10:27:41] <gregf_> the console shows an error
[10:27:45] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:27:59] <gregf_> but its a valid JSON object :/
[10:28:07] <duch_kazatel> what's the error?
[10:28:24] <gregf_> SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[10:28:42] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:28:52] <duch_kazatel> in the "response"?
[10:29:39] <duch_kazatel> I need context for the error.
[10:32:08] <bberry> Okay, so on a button click, i want to have an overlay where you can fill in a bunch of text fields and then click a button to submit it.  Should i create the all the text fields and stuff using createElement in js, or should i have a div that is hidden/disabled and then make it appear when you click the button. or is there some other solution?
[10:32:59] <duch_kazatel> bberry hidden markup is my preference.
[10:33:09] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: yep. its weird, but its a valid json object
[10:33:11] <duch_kazatel> what happens when somebody doesn't have javascript?
[10:33:23] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ could you take a screenshot of what you're seeing?
[10:33:32] <gregf_> sure
[10:37:43] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: ok this is sample data: {"blp":"8683.33","fact_opt":[{"price":"875.00","description":"interior material package in crystal grey","code":"IBE"},{"price":"216.67","description":"grey metallic","code":"ECG"}]}
[10:38:00] <gregf_> that does look like a proper object :/
[10:38:08] <Atlantic777> I'm trying to use jQuery mobile dialogs but something's wrong. I tried with <a data-role="dialog"> and with $.mobile.changePage("#div_id") and $.mobile.changePage("dialog.html") but the result is the same.
[10:38:13] <bberry> duch_kazatel: Okay. separation of concerns again?
[10:38:29] <Atlantic777> The "dialog" opens, has those rounded corners but style isn't ok.
[10:38:37] <duch_kazatel> bberry not really?
[10:38:50] <Atlantic777> It just white "dialog" on "white background". Any ideas how and what to debug?
[10:39:04] <durango> Any reason why $.ajax is NOT sending to OPTIONS before a POST with crossDomain: true and xhrFields: { withCredentails: true } ?
[10:39:10] <bberry> duch_kazatel: k. i thot that it would be bad to generate all this HTML when you can just do it in the .html file.
[10:39:32] <duch_kazatel> bberry generally it is.  don't generate a ton of markup in javascript if you can avoid it.
[10:39:50] <duch_kazatel> and gregf_ something tells you you're missing something basic.  i gotta go get some work done all.
[10:39:52] <duch_kazatel> sorry.
[10:39:55] <duch_kazatel> good luck.
[10:39:56] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: is the syntax i pasted in jfiddle proper :/
[10:40:05] <gregf_> *jsfiddle
[10:40:31] <gregf_> or is jsonp a different format?
[10:41:44] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2681466/jsonp-with-jquery
[10:41:48] <duch_kazatel> enjoy :)
[10:43:44] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: i need to learn to google seems liek :/. thanks tho' much!
[10:43:51] <gregf_> *like
[10:43:53] <durango> no
[10:43:59] <durango> whoops wrong chat
[10:44:17] <durango> so yeah does anyone know why jquery woul d*not* send OPTIONS before POST on a cross domain?
[10:48:22] * ChaZ Test :D

[10:54:14] <cusco> hi folks, using datatables calling fnAddData() I would like the new row to have a specified ID
[10:54:21] <cusco> how should I acomplish this?
[10:55:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> Swayz: your welcome :D
[10:55:48] * Swayz *Thumbs Up*
[10:56:37] <fission6> anyone around to help me continue to investigate why the code is not executing when i dynamical pop in a <Script> element? https://dpaste.de/bmwy
[11:05:52] <cusco> hmm
[11:06:04] <cusco> how do I select all <li> that have class 'xpto'
[11:06:12] <cusco> $('td .xpto')
[11:06:16] <cusco> does't seem to work
[11:06:27] <NoiseEee> cusco: why would you choose td?
[11:06:34] <NoiseEee> you just asked about <li> ?
[11:06:35] <cusco> I meant <td> not <li>
[11:06:36] <cusco> lol
[11:06:38] <cusco> sorry
[11:06:46] <NoiseEee> cusco: kill the space in the selector
[11:06:50] <cusco> ah thanks
[11:06:57] <NoiseEee> np
[11:07:48] <BillCriswell> I wonder if he literally killed it.
[11:07:57] <cusco> with a knif
[11:07:58] <cusco> with a knife
[11:08:27] <cusco> using .each() I'm trying to update a progress bar... and adding elements, but only at the end of the each() the progress bar shows
[11:08:31] <cusco> what could be wrong?
[11:11:14] <NoiseEee> chaining it to the end of each() so it only happens after the iteration?  show some code, channel crystal ball has been down since gov't stopped working
[11:14:50] <jedimind> with a spoon cusco
[11:15:00] <jedimind> he's a vicious bastard
[11:17:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> Swayz: sry I had to do that.....but its neccessary
[11:17:49] <Swayz> its fine
[11:18:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> you have to admit it was funny
[11:20:43] <BillCriswell> Patrick Swayze used illegal parts on his train.
[11:22:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: lol?
[11:23:11] <BillCriswell> Trailer Park Boys joke.
[11:25:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhh
[11:52:12] <Dykotomee> Hey guys, qq: I have a ton of JS and somewhere, somehow, a function is being bound to an element's hover event. I can't find where this is happening - what tool[s] do you guys use?
[11:52:23] <Dykotomee> I've tried $._data, but that hasn't helped locate the source.
[11:54:45] <cnap> hey people how are u today ?

[11:57:33] <cnap> what would be a nice approach to do this ?
[11:58:07] <cnap> I see there are image sliders, html sliders not sure which one will be the easiest and correct approach
[12:00:55] <quadHelix> Greetings all,  I am attempting to use the jquery datepicker widget to determine rush fee's for a clients order.  I have a working jquery datepicker dialog that is inputing the selected date into a database.  How should I go about calculating the due date?  I can paste the widget I am using  if desired...
[12:01:23] <quadHelix> Should it be performed via java script or server side PHP?
[12:06:05] <Deele> if I have defined $(function() { function foo() { } }); how do I call foo() now, outside jquery?

[12:29:21] <fission6> Deele: why did you define it like that
[12:32:33] <Quest> when menu is clicked. it shows three menus. the reason is that I am using classes and not ids. but I want this functionality on a page with many menu buttons. how can I do that ? http://jsfiddle.net/MMfJZ/5/

[12:37:55] <charanl> hi, I am trying to detect the keycodes on keyup, click and navigating on 1, 2, 3, 13. what are the other valid keycodes to navigate?
[12:38:01] <odyniec> Quest: it modifies the selector to match in the context of the element that was clicked
[12:38:21] <Quest> hm
[12:39:03] <Quest> odyniec,  so you added the "this" keyword ?
[12:39:03] <Quest> $('.board-number-3-menu-options', this).toggle();
[12:39:12] <odyniec> Quest: yep
[12:39:45] <Quest> nice
[12:39:46] <Quest> thanks
[12:39:54] <odyniec> yw
[12:44:43] <Atlantic777> After opening a dialog in jquery mobile there's a "pop in" effect which sets a dark overlay but that overlay dissapears right after the effect finishes.
[12:45:14] <Atlantic777> I'm using $.mobile.changePage() and data-role="dialog"
[12:45:43] <Atlantic777> Any ideas?
[12:50:53] <jphase> Atlantic777: hmm, that should be fine, but maybe try passing your role in your changePage call?
[12:51:09] <jphase> $.mobile.changePage('#myPage', {transition: 'pop', role: 'dialog'});
[12:51:28] <Atlantic777> jphase: I do that, without transition though...
[12:51:39] <jphase> oic, hmm
[12:51:48] <jphase> idk, that's "supposed" to work :\
[12:52:44] <Atlantic777> it wouldn't be interesting if everything is just working :D
[12:52:52] <jphase> heh
[12:53:03] <jphase> not fiddleable?
[12:53:23] <Atlantic777> i can try...
[13:04:19] <Atlantic777> jphase: yeah, on jsfiddle it "just works".
[13:04:41] <jphase> doh!
[13:04:46] <jphase> h8 when that happens :[
[13:11:00] <Atlantic777> jphase: hahah, ok, this one's good. :D
[13:11:10] <Atlantic777> typo in base html template
[13:11:19] <jphase> bazinga
[13:11:37] <charanl> sorry for repeating. Does anyone know "I am trying to detect the keycodes on keyup, click and navigating on 1, 2, 3, 13. what are the other valid keycodes to navigate?"
[13:27:56] <jphase> charanl: this is my resource for that:   http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html
[13:28:21] <charanl> jphase, thanks
[13:29:23] <jphase> charanl: if you need a more basic set of keys:  http://www.javascripter.net/faq/keycodes.htm that one is good too
[13:32:44] <charanl> jphase, no, I wanted to figure out that what all are valid combinations for navigating. Like cmd + clk
[13:32:57] <jphase> ohh
[13:35:23] <charanl> jphase, the basic ones would be 1,2,3, 13. But to include things like I stated above, had to compare complex conditions
[13:36:30] <jphase> charanl: hmm, well you can grab key modifiers from the first one, and here's some with shift: http://selfcontained.us/2009/09/16/getting-keycode-values-in-javascript/  but you need more ctrl modifiers I suppose
[13:38:06] <jphase> aha, here we go
[13:38:09] <jphase> charanl: http://www.k68.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Key_Codes.htm
[13:38:10] <charanl> jphase, I am trying to see combos like e.keycode = 1 && e.ctrlKey
[13:39:53] <Xander1> hello
[13:41:40] <charanl> jphase, yeah, that looks like a more detailed explanation of keycodes in JS
[13:41:44] <Xander1> got an issue when i try to use .each function - it returns the same field over and over: https://gist.github.com/albertpak/9b5b3c85e9a1b371d6b8 - same field_type and value…what am i doing wrong?
[13:43:33] <jphase> Xander1: instead of $("[id^=profilefieldname]").val() you should probably use $(this).val()
[13:43:46] <jphase> or... actually
[13:44:14] <jphase> $(this).children("[id^=profilefieldname]")).val();
[13:45:19] <jphase> Xander1: actually, even better.... $(this).children('#profilefieldname').val();
[13:45:30] <jphase> no need to match with regex selector in your case
[13:45:45] <Xander1> @jphase ok, let me try that
[13:50:02] <Xander1> @jphase - that worked but it skips first one
[13:51:18] <jphase> Xander1: you have no id on the first
[13:51:28] <jphase> can you change that or you need the regex selector?
[13:52:50] <Xander1> wow! thank you for pointing that out :)
[13:52:55] <Xander1> can't believe i missed that
[13:59:45] <jphase> np
[14:04:44] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/mDK2M/2/ -- I'm processing some content with Embedly and finally cloning it into a separate Packery page. But at that Packery page, how come there's a huge white gap at the bottom?
[14:10:07] <jphase> boytoy: what browser are you using? I'm not seeing the white space at the bottom I don't think
[14:10:26] <jphase> ohhh the background color
[14:10:54] <boytoy> ah yeah the bg =)
[14:11:13] <shoky> boytoy: i think it's cause of the hash added to the url
[14:11:18] <boytoy> this does not happen with Packery only: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/mDK2M/3/ ..
[14:11:33] <boytoy> shoky: oh yeah?
[14:12:03] <boytoy> ooh lah lah ai karamba
[14:12:59] <boytoy> shoky: why would that be a problem though?
[14:14:00] <shoky> boytoy: is there a problem? outside of jsfiddle?
[14:14:53] <shoky> i don't see anything happening at your 2nd link tho so maybe i donno what you're talking about
[14:15:31] <boytoy> shoky: Well yeah the white gap happens outside of jsfiddle as well
[14:15:49] <boytoy> nevermind that 2nd link =)
[14:16:03] <shoky> i only saw a gap in the jsfiddle interface, because the whole window got scrolled
[14:16:42] <boytoy> lemme screenie this weenie for ya, 1 sec
[14:16:53] <shoky> wee
[14:17:51] <boytoy> shoky: http://s22.postimg.org/vjmi9mza9/Untitled_2.png u getting this over at your place too?
[14:18:38] <shoky> you're talking about the gap on the right or on the bottom?
[14:18:55] <Atlantic777> jphase: hey, can you try to make me a fiddle for triggering some function on dialog create? I can't make it work. :/
[14:19:29] <boytoy> shoky: on the right i think.. not exactly gap, but rather the lower half of the page gets a white bg instead of black
[14:19:31] <jphase> Atlantic777: sure, let me finish thing thing up for this client real quick
[14:19:43] <Atlantic777> jphase: thanks ;)
[14:23:28] <shoky> boytoy: put  overflow: auto  on #packery_page
[14:23:56] <boytoy> oh word!!
[14:24:40] <boytoy> shoky: thanks man, this has been a very long standing bug of mine.. at least 2 weeks =)
[14:25:21] <shoky> np ;p
[14:25:28] <boytoy> curious why i have to set overflow auto though.. when at http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/mDK2M/3/ (without the embedly and deferred code) i do not have to set overflow auto..
[14:26:04] <shoky> boytoy: cause jqmobile has it on overflow:visible
[14:26:29] <shoky> which causes it to have no scrollbar of its own, so the window got the scrollbar to show the overflow
[14:27:11] <boytoy> oh riiiiiiight riiiiiiiiiight.. hmm..
[14:27:14] <shoky> and when you scrolled the window (instead of #packery_page's content) you were looking at the content overflowed into the window
[14:28:13] <boytoy> ah yeah, i see, hence the black bg only on the visible portion?
[14:29:03] <shoky> yea
[14:30:58] <shoky> how does #packery_page get those jqmobile classes anyway?
[14:32:35] <boytoy> shoky: i think because it's inside data-role="page" which is what jqmobile expects
[14:33:26] <shoky> boytoy: yea but you're adding that element dynamically.. and i don't see you running anything like .trigger('create') on it to trigger the jqmobile stuff
[14:34:24] <shoky> i guess clicking the link does it
[14:34:40] <boytoy> ah yeah, true theres a little logical breach there ;)
[14:34:54] <boytoy> anyway jqmobile's css is a disaster area
[14:35:00] <shoky> ya it's the link doing it
[14:35:07] <boytoy> cool
[14:35:25] <boytoy> heres my current struggles with it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6529
[14:35:25] <b-ot> boytoy: Issue #6529 by jp1988 (6d 2h ago): Stuff we could do without in structure only CSS
[14:38:05] <aphid> how feasible is it to start a GET request of a hunk of JSON and abort the xfer if the modified date in the header doesn't match x?
[14:38:15] <aphid> s/hunk of JSON/a JSON file
[14:38:23] <duch_kazatel> aphid wat
[14:39:16] <duch_kazatel> aphid that would involve a chunking mechanism.
[14:43:12] <aphid> what i'm doing now is i have a one line/one function php thing that passes the modified date of the data, if it's newer than what's in localStorage it pulls.. otherwise just uses what's already in the client.  if I could do it all with one request and nothing on the server it would be … elegant.
[14:43:18] <aphid> hellagant
[14:44:26] * hexed is gone: idle 30 minutes [2:43pm]
[14:51:51] <Atlantic777> jphase: nevermind, I hacked it somehow with $(document).delegate("#pageDeailog", "pageshow", function() {...});
[14:52:15] <duch_kazatel> Atlantic777 what version of jquery are you using?
[14:52:25] <jphase> Atlantic777: oh nice!
[14:52:34] <Atlantic777> duch_kazatel: jQuery mobile 1.3.2
[14:52:59] <Atlantic777> too much typos, time for a pause
[14:53:02] <duch_kazatel> Atlantic777 you might want to use .on() instead
[14:54:13] <Atlantic777> duch_kazatel: on('pageshow') doesn't seem to work...
[14:54:45] <duch_kazatel> $('parent).on('event', 'selector', function(){})
[14:55:05] <duch_kazatel> adding that second arg to .on() forcet it to use delegation.
[14:55:22] <duch_kazatel> *forces
[14:58:22] <ChaZ> duch_kazatel a short question: http://jsfiddle.net/dmbostan/YaMfQ/ i have getjson and I try to wrap it in a function but it wouldn't work. Is my syntax ok?
[14:59:18] <duch_kazatel> ChaZ huh?
[14:59:22] <duch_kazatel> why are you doing that?
[14:59:56] <duch_kazatel> ah i get it now.
[15:00:02] <ChaZ> earlier you said to reload the getjson, i need to call the function
[15:00:29] <duch_kazatel> wait are you testing this IN jsfiddle?
[15:00:38] <ChaZ> nope
[15:00:43] <ChaZ> on my server
[15:01:07] <duch_kazatel> because I'm getting nothing back from that URL./
[15:03:05] <ChaZ> here is a working example: http://chivriga.com/PrivescApp/assets/www/jsonp.html
[15:03:18] <ChaZ> i just can't wrap it in a function
[15:03:42] <ChaZ> so i could call it later
[15:04:50] <aphid> ChaZ you sure document is ready when you call retrieve() ?
[15:04:55] <aphid> could be trying to append to stuff that aint there
[15:05:13] <aphid> are you seeing the request go off in console?
[15:07:40] <ChaZ> aphid the console shows nothing
[15:09:55] <ChaZ> aphid Thanks! It was the document.ready issue. Sorry, but I'm still learning
[15:22:10] <Atlantic777> How can I pass arguments to a callback?
[15:22:20] <Atlantic777> Like, button.on('click', callback);
[15:22:30] <Atlantic777> function callback(arg1, arg2) {...};
[15:24:37] <shoky> button.on('click', { arg1: 'hi', arg2: 'wow' }, function(e) { console.log( e.data.arg1, e.data.arg2 ) })
[15:25:13] <shoky> also...   var arg1 = ..., arg2 = ...;  button.on('click', function() { console.log(arg1, arg2) })
[15:25:16] <Atlantic777> shoky: it should work without inline definition?
[15:25:40] <shoky> yes
[15:26:01] <Atlantic777> great, let's try :)
[15:48:26] <Atlantic777> shoky: nope, I can't make it work. http://jsfiddle.net/w7WTY/
[15:49:19] <duch_kazatel> Atlantic777 the second arg to .on() is the element to watch.
[15:49:38] <Atlantic777> duch_kazatel: sorry, I don't understand.
[15:50:17] <duch_kazatel> .on() has 2 versions.  the version you're using is $('parent').on('event', 'selector', function(){}})
[15:50:40] <Atlantic777> aham, ok
[15:50:59] <Atlantic777> So, what about this?
[15:51:00] <Atlantic777> 00:24 < shoky> button.on('click', { arg1: 'hi', arg2: 'wow' }, function(e) { console.log( e.data.arg1, e.data.arg2 ) })
[15:51:01] <duch_kazatel> you attach to a parent element that exists at time of binding.  the "selecter" should match on whatever you want to trigger on.
[15:51:16] <odyniec> Atlantic777: FTFY: http://jsfiddle.net/w7WTY/1/
[15:51:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah that should work.
[15:51:55] <duch_kazatel> what odyniec posted i mean.
[15:52:12] <Atlantic777> argh, sorry shoky
[15:52:20] <Atlantic777> thanks guys
[16:02:22] <defk0n> Hey does anyone know how to log output from firefox console? im getting: -- The string you are trying to view is too long to be displayed by the Web Console.
[16:08:55] <defk0n> nvm
[16:35:15] <ChaZ> When clicking a link, the JSON is not updated, the console is clean. Can someone give me a link to the docs?
[16:39:20] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com
[16:59:00] <bobbytek> Does remove() remove all bound event handlers on descendant elements as well?
[16:59:10] <bobbytek> Or only direct children?
[17:00:45] <jphase> bobbytek: remove() should remove whatever selected elements and all their events (including all their children and child events)
[17:01:04] <bobbytek> Children doesn't imply grandchildren though...
[17:01:37] <bobbytek> The docs are a bit vague here
[17:02:04] <bobbytek> Technically a grandchild is not a child of the grandparent
[17:05:37] <bobbytek> jphase, Thoughts?
[17:06:58] <jphase> bobbytek: hmm, if you have a bunch of elements inside a div for example, and those elements have events, when you .remove() the parent div it literally removes it from the DOM, including all children recursively (so grandchildren should be included).
[17:08:23] <bobbytek> jphase, I agree that from a DOM perspective the grandchildren will be removed. But does that hold for handlers as well?
[17:08:45] <jphase> ohh
[17:09:25] <jphase> bobbytek: read this explanation in the first answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/209029/best-way-to-remove-an-event-handler-in-jquery
[17:09:28] <bobbytek> I'm not sure how to parse the documentation in that regard
[17:09:29] <bobbytek> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13945025/jquery-remove-all-event-handlers-inside-element
[17:09:41] <bobbytek> Shows that you need to use *
[17:10:57] <jphase> bobbytek: if your event handler is used with the $('body').on('click', childelement, function(){  type way, it may be best to unbind first to be safe, idk, I'd just test by reinserting the same elements to check
[17:13:30] <bobbytek> jphase, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L357
[17:13:56] <bobbytek> Looks like the call jQuery.cleanData( getAll( elem ) ) does a recursive remove
[17:13:57] <jphase> oo nice
[17:14:21] <guideX> is there some way to animate $("#my").append("<blah>");
[17:14:28] <bobbytek> getAll( elem ) uses '*' if the second argument isn't provided
[17:14:49] <jphase> guideX: jQuery masonry or jQuery packery
[17:15:10] <guideX> oh hmm
[17:15:13] <jphase> there's a few others too
[17:15:20] <guideX> there isn't a simple way to do it without a library?
[17:15:28] <guideX> like fadein or sometjhing
[17:15:33] <jphase> guideX: well, you'd have to make your own methods yeah
[17:15:46] <jphase> not methods like .method but... animation methods
[17:16:08] <guideX> something like this $("myappended").fadeIn(200, function () { or something
[17:16:29] <guideX> I suppose I could hide them and then use the fadein
[17:16:35] <guideX> hmm I guess i'll do that :)
[17:16:40] <jphase> bobbytek: for loop line 362 looks like it's missing something, is that normal?
[17:16:45] <guideX> thanks
[17:16:51] <jphase> np
[17:17:05] <jphase> bah, I gotta go, sorry bobbytek :[
[17:17:14] * jphase = bad friend
[17:17:26] <jphase> ciao

[18:32:01] <funhouse> Hi guys just wondering what you guys use to minify your scripts?
[18:36:54] <tw2113> sublime text plugin
[18:37:03] <tw2113> and if i happen to get to use grunt, i just use their stuff to minify
[19:23:08] * Rohan_Bhangui ahhhh Sublime, sweet, sweet Sbulime
[19:23:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> *suvlime
[19:23:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> *sublime
[19:33:24] <raj> I think the worst part of writing code in perpetual callbacks is the indentation
[19:33:55] <raj> probably shouldn't use the word perpetual with you guys
[19:34:12] <shoky> using promises can alleviate some of that
[19:34:23] <tw2113> totes to the shoky
[19:34:34] <shoky> probably shouldn't use the world alleviate with raj
[19:34:44] <shoky> oi tw2113
[19:34:49] <raj> haha
[19:34:51] <tw2113> you two should spare everyone, don't use words with each other
[19:35:01] <raj> clever one
[19:35:09] * shoky farts
[19:35:16] <shoky> now who's clever
[19:35:22] <tw2113> air communication
[19:35:26] <tw2113> now do morse code that way
[19:35:40] <raj> extra points if you don't shard
[19:35:42] <shoky> i can do json that way
[19:35:51] <tw2113> without syntax error?
[19:36:03] <shoky> depends what i had for dinner
[19:37:34] <mehwork> is it just me or does chrome's dev tools kinda suck for jquery debugging? Like it's not even showing me scripts that are loaded in the 'source' tab
[19:37:43] <mehwork> sources
[19:38:30] <mehwork> which makes it so i can't set a break point where i need to
[19:38:58] <tw2113> maybe it only shows scripts that load properly
[19:40:36] <mehwork> well if i view source it shows the file should be loading properly: <script src="js/whatever.js"></script>
[19:40:49] <tw2113> are you clicking it to make sure you're not getting 404?
[19:41:01] <mehwork> clicking what
[19:41:06] <tw2113> the link to the js file
[19:41:06] <mehwork> oh
[19:41:07] <mehwork> yeah
[19:41:13] <mehwork> loads fine when i do that
[19:41:24] <tw2113> public url?
[19:41:31] <tw2113> i can try in my chrome copy, even if i'm a firefox guy
[19:41:43] <mehwork> wish it was but it's not public yet
[19:42:09] <mehwork> in the 'scripts' section of the 'resources' tab it shows all the scripts
[19:42:42] <mehwork> but in the 'sources' tab it only shows like 3 out of the 12 that should be showing
[19:43:35] <tw2113> try in firefox, see if it does the same
[19:43:38] <tw2113> just an idea
[19:43:40] <mehwork> good idea
[19:45:43] <mehwork> firebug is only showing ONE script, jquery.min
[19:45:57] <mehwork> even when i click the 'show all static and eval scripts' thing
[19:46:13] <mehwork> ohhhh
[19:46:17] <mehwork> if i click on the dropdown it shows it
[19:46:45] <mehwork> unfortunately chrome doesn't have a dropdown like that. It just shows what it shows which is 4 files as tabs
[19:47:46] <mehwork> at least i can use firebug to set breakpoints but it seems like chrome should be working too. Wonder if i'm doing something wrong of if it's just a bug
[19:53:02] <raj> how do I return a promise object at the end of one of my functions
[19:53:09] <raj> so i can then run another function afterwards
[19:54:01] <raj> `function parent(){ myFunc().done(function() { doOtherStuff() }) }
[19:54:02] <raj> `
[19:54:16] <raj> so I want myFunc() to return a promise object, I think
[19:55:31] <mehwork> based off that code it looks like you don't want it to return
[19:56:01] <raj> I haven't defined myFunc there
[19:56:31] <CorySimmons> Hi guys, I'm looking to learn about jQuery's AJAX function and specifically using it to interact with an API
[19:56:50] <CorySimmons> Basically I'm wondering if there are any dummy API sites out there that I can test with
[19:57:50] <raj> CorySimmons, you can use jsfiddle.net
[19:57:59] <raj> click Ajax Requests on the left side
[19:58:02] <mehwork> CorySimmons: or googling turns up http://mollom.com/api
[19:58:18] <CorySimmons> What about Postman?
[19:58:27] <CorySimmons> Could I use that to create some dumby API to play with?
[20:02:52] <CorySimmons> Thanks a lot guys ;)

[20:04:54] <Erneston> hello
[20:06:07] <Erneston> is jquery 1.10 capable of parallex scrolling?
[20:08:07] <tw2113> were earlier versions capable
[20:08:07] <tw2113> ?
[20:11:50] <Erneston> not sure, first time i looked at this
[20:12:28] <tw2113> my money is on "yes, it'd be fine"
[20:12:42] <tw2113> check parallax scroll sites and see what version of jQuery they use
[20:18:24] <raj> that's neat, didn't know there was a name for that
[20:38:47] <RonWhoCares> How do I empty the contents of this  <textarea id="latest_news"></textarea>?  $('#latest_news').val(''); didn't work.

[21:36:01] <CorySimmons> Hey guys, how would I go about fetching a range of JSON? Say I wanted to get JSON "rows" in increments of 5
[21:36:43] <CorySimmons> Or do I have to fetch the entire thing, and then do some hiding stuff?
[21:37:01] <CorySimmons> It'd be nice if I could just fetch them in increments of 5
