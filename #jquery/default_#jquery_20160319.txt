[06:17:48] <amincd> hi, if I have a table, with a number of <tr> elements, and all the elements have the same class (client_row), and I want some data to be pulled from one of the columns of a row, when that row is clicked, how would I do that?
[07:02:22] <ravu> Hi
[10:15:26] <noname85421> Good day

[10:17:28] <noname85421> how should i construct selector?
[10:43:01] <gagi_new> try this: $( "ul:first > li" ) noname85421
[10:57:38] <everson> Hi. I've set my mouse cursor to be "wait" on ajaxStart and remove "wait" on ajaxComplete. In my ajax calls, in the success block, I sometimes show an alert() message. The mouse cursor remains on the "wait" animation until after I close the alert() message. I tried using ajaxSuccess instead of ajaxComplete just to test if it does the same, and it still does. Is there an event for ajaxSuccess that would fire off before the alert() message s
[10:57:39] <everson> hows?
[10:59:33] <gagi_new> everson: can you show the code? because It's really confusing this way...
[11:00:14] <everson> gagi_new, not sure how to jsfiddle an ajax call
[11:01:04] <gagi_new> everson:  you don't have to .... just so I understand where you put the alert..
[11:01:52] <everson> gagi_new, for what it's worth, I've manage to solve this using a brief timeout before displaying the alret
[11:02:30] <everson> it seems the alert() fires before the ajaxSuccess event has chance to update my css for the mouse cursor.
[11:02:53] <gagi_new> everson:  the thing is alert is a user input so, it wont let you go on in the code until the user will press ok...
[11:03:43] <everson> gagi_new, surely the ajaxSuccess event fires as soon as the ajax call returns successfully (ie: before the success: block in the ajax call has a chance to process its contents such as an alert() message)
[11:06:03] <gagi_new> everson: btw, do you know how to use deffered objects? from my experience onSuccess attribute sometimes returns success too fast. that's why I started to use the deffered objects function like, .then() ,fail() ,.done()
[11:06:22] <everson> gagi_new, nope but I'll look into that, thanks :)_
[11:07:02] <gagi_new> everson: wellcome.
[13:33:53] <jose3> WHat do you think is going on with my code: I am working on my app and it runs fine on its 1st run: but then any subsequent runs chrome says: Uncaught TypeError: synonyms is not a function
[13:35:18] <jose3> What do ya'll think of this: here is the base of the code: https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/3bd8ddc11e5572637060. So i included 2 functions, one main one and the one that keeps causing the error
[13:37:35] <z1haze> can anyone explain how some admin templates have modules that you click a button and they go full screen? is that a plugin or just some simple css?
[13:38:18] <shoky> jose3:  line 52 seems .. suspicious.. :p
[13:55:11] <jose3> shoky: in what way?
[13:55:53] <shoky> jose3: it is assigning an array to `synonyms`.  remember your error message: "synonyms is not a function"
[13:57:29] <jose3> Im just going to rebuild this function I guess
[13:57:42] <jose3> I cant figure out the exact problem, ill rebuild it with .map
[13:57:44] <shoky> jose3:  you just need to add `var` before that line..
[13:57:54] <shoky> you're changing what `synonyms` points to
[13:57:59] <shoky> the global synonyms
[13:58:15] <shoky> so you're changing it from being that synonyms function, to being that array
[13:58:25] <shoky> hence, it is no longer a function the 2nd time you try to call it
[13:58:40] <jose3> Ohh
[13:58:43] <jose3> boy
[13:58:46] <jose3> You are right
[13:58:50] <shoky> if you put `var` at the beginning of that line, it'll make it a local variable and you won't overwrite the outer one
[13:59:06] <jose3> bu outer one.... do you mean the function itself?
[13:59:10] <shoky> yes
[13:59:16] <jose3> snappppppppppp
[13:59:21] <shoky> or rather, the reference to the function
[13:59:32] <jose3> so best practice... would you not name those 2 things the same in the future?
[13:59:53] <shoky> best practice: use var for local vairables :)
[14:00:01] <jose3> yes
[14:00:01] <shoky> then you don't care about name clashing with outer stuff
[14:00:11] <jose3> got chya, thanks
[14:01:08] <cangelosx1> Does anyone use Date.js? I can't find a method in the documentation to get the milliseconds or unix timestamp.
[14:03:30] <shoky> cangelosx: no, people use moment.js
[14:04:58] <cangelosx1> shoky: I'll check it out. Thanks
[14:09:18] <cangelosx1> shoky: I'm reading through the docs, but I don't see anything about parsing offsets like `+7d`
[14:14:22] <jose3> Anyone ride a motorcycle?
[14:15:52] <shoky> cangelosx1: i didn't say it has every single feature that date.js has ;p
[14:16:22] <cangelosx1> I know, but it appears to be better made and designed, so I figured I could do moment('3 days ago') or moment('-7d')
[14:17:40] <cangelosx1> shoky: basically I have records stored in my database like 'Last 30 days' is {start: '-30d', end:'+1d'}
[14:17:57] <cangelosx1> shoky: is there a format I can pass moment.js so it calculates that?
[14:18:05] <cangelosx1> I can easily change format in database
[14:20:11] <shoky> don't think there's a text format you can pass it so it does that, no
[14:20:51] <shoky> should be pretty easy to parse yourself tho
[14:23:09] <cangelosx1> nah, too much
[14:23:13] <cangelosx1> I'm the backend guy
[14:23:26] <cangelosx1> who also has to do frontend
[14:23:27] <cangelosx1> lol
[14:26:56] <shoky> closest thing i found was that you can parse iso8601 durations that look like "P3D" for 3 days.  http://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/creating/
[14:58:14] <phpcoder> hello everybody
[14:58:17] <phpcoder> pardon for the stupid question
[14:58:39] <phpcoder> but how can i add a class if i have a raw html like:       <div class="item">1111111</div>
[14:58:40] <phpcoder> ?
[14:59:02] <phpcoder> i should add a class ...so it should be "item active"
[15:01:37] <phpcoder> someone here?
[15:58:30] <mohsen_> Any idea why doesn't this code work: http://pastebin.com/7xKvXc2F
[18:55:17] <vacho> why does my first deseletAll work but not second one within my loop? http://pastie.org/10766609
[18:55:26] <vacho> how do I call deselectAll from within my loop?
[18:56:45] <shoky> vacho: because it's a different `this` inside. you can save a reference to the outer one and use that
[18:57:37] <vacho> shoky: I tried saving a reference like this but no luck..... var select_picker = $(this).selectpicker('deselectAll'); select_picker.selectpicker('deselectAll');
[18:59:59] <vacho> shoky: any ideas?
[19:00:26] <shoky> vacho: donno what you're doing really, since it's not a <select> anymore, why are you looking for .find(':selected')
[19:00:40] <shoky> and you can get a select's value with  .value on the select itself, no need to loop through the options
[19:04:42] <vacho> shoky: it's a multi select.. so I have to loop through it.. if I find a "no" value.. I want to deselectALL on my selectpicker.. I can't seem to figure this out.
[19:05:17] <shoky> vacho dunno, i can help if you make a jsfiddle
[19:07:04] <shoky> vacho: you can also get the values as an array by calling  .selectpicker('val')
[19:07:20] <vacho> ok that might help..thx
[19:08:22] <shoky> vacho also show your code after the change you did
[19:08:27] <shoky> not sure where you put that var select_picker
[19:09:25] <vacho> shoky: I am getting null when I do $(this).selectpicker('deselectAll');
[19:09:53] <shoky> vacho: i cant help without seeing the full context of that code.  again, probably `this` is not what you think it is
[19:27:02] <Newtonianb> question: how can I base 64 encode my json before sending it to the backend. Right now I setup a hook to do some processing on my POST json data and finally base 64 everything before sending it to the server. I did this using ajaxaPreFilter.  My problem is on the php receiving end I get an empty $_GET and an empty $_POST although in my browser NETWORK I see the Request Payload with the encoded
[19:27:02] <Newtonianb> value. I noticed dataType and contentType, I've been playing with these but I still can't get to access the request payload when I set contentType to text/plain
[20:16:38] <jspanda> Hi!
[20:17:37] <jspanda> I read the jQuery UI documentation but couldn't find any information as to which CSS classes are used by the Selectable component. Did I miss it or is it documented elsewhere?
[20:22:04] <shoky> jspanda: don't think it's in the docs, but easy to inspect the elements and see `ui-selectee`, `ui-selecting`, `ui-selected`
[20:23:41] <jspanda> shoky: yeah I'd started to inspect already, was just wondering if there was an official list since manual inspection means I might miss one
[20:23:47] <shoky> jspanda: looking at the source, there's also  ui-unselecting,  ui-selectable-helper,
[20:24:00] <shoky> and the whole selectable container gets  ui-selectable
[20:24:02] <shoky> and that's it ;p
[20:25:39] <jspanda> shoky: Ok, thank you for your help
[20:26:54] <shoky> jspanda: seems they'ev added it for the latest version  https://api.jqueryui.com/1.12/selectable/
[20:27:11] <shoky> to the docs, that is
[20:27:50] <jspanda> Indeed. Wow, how could I have missed that :)
[20:28:26] <shoky> jspanda: because that version is still a release candidate
[20:28:37] <shoky> jspanda: i found that page via google
[20:28:47] <shoky> specifically searching for those class names ;p
[20:29:08] <shoky> not that stinking google made it easy
[20:31:13] <jspanda> Yeah, google likes to return code from random Github repos and jsfiddles in my experience :)
[20:32:37] <jspanda> That, intermixed with various stackoverflow questions that are more or less related to the actual search
[20:33:04] <ondra_> Hello guys, may I ask you for advice? I am doing my first project with jQuery and I got lost in selectors. What should i use when i want to select element with class newvalue which is in div with id tel2? I've tried to use $(".newvalue > #tel2") but with no luck.
[20:33:08] <shoky> and suggestions for how it thinks you really meant to spell ui-unselectable or whatever
[20:33:49] <shoky> ondra_: that looks for #tel2 that's a direct child of .newvalue
[20:34:09] <shoky> ondra_: what you described would be  $("#tel2 .newvalue")
[20:34:42] <ondra_> oh, kill me! thank you so much!
[20:46:16] <z1haze> how could I build this graph with actual data? http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.9.1/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/pie-legend/
[20:47:12] <z1haze> i have the data, I just am having trouble figuring out how to get it into the graph.. this one seems diffrent than typical line graphs because i just pass the data as a whole for the line graph and it just ubilds itself from start to finish.. this one is different because there are specific sections
[20:48:40] <z1haze> actually, sorry I think i understand now, i wasnt thinking clearly
[20:52:03] <jspanda> zlhaze: see the 'series' property of the object passed to the highcharts function? That's where you put your data
[20:54:59] <jspanda> Here, for example, I added another browser by adding an element to this array http://jsfiddle.net/p4do84kq/
[20:58:39] <jspanda> Every item in that array has a name property, and a 'y' property which I assume is a coordinate to allow you to make three-dimensionnal graphs
[20:58:46] <jspanda> For example, to replace the data: http://jsfiddle.net/p4do84kq/1/
[21:49:07] <psyxopompos> getJSON, how to get JSON object?

[22:54:27] <easyOnMe> sorry I just want to ask this question again
[22:55:20] <easyOnMe> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vGxXYN
[22:55:27] <easyOnMe> that is the codepenio url
[22:56:00] <easyOnMe> I just want to implement a scenario that when an image is clicked a text is written on top of the image at its center
[22:56:05] <easyOnMe> that is all that simple
[22:59:03] <easyOnMe> the thing is the code is working as per console.log check but I do not get to see the text at all
