[11:12:05] <Jesper> Hi guys! I'm having trouble with a form that i create dynamically, when I try to submit it. Here's a jsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/hqtn6q9z/1/
[11:12:20] <Jesper> First of all, I can create the form dynamically, and get it displayed
[11:12:53] <Jesper> However, when I try to submit the form, I'm having trouble.. I can reach the first console.log("registered click");
[11:13:17] <Jesper> But I never reach the second console.log("submitting form") statement
[11:24:41] <bancik> hi, how can I listen for a svg modification?
[13:58:20] <juinn> can someone help on how i get day difference please? https://jsfiddle.net/vxpexqc8/
[14:19:34] <pavonia> juinn: Give the date as string: new Date("2017/03/15")
[14:23:19] <pavonia> Apparently, Date(2017/03/15) is legal too, but would be considered the same as Date(44.822222) which is the time 45 miliseconds after midnight of Jan 1 1970 ;)

[16:58:08] <mkwia> Hi all, I am having trouble finding the width of an element. http://i.imgur.com/oALgtay.png
[17:03:13] <pavonia> mkwia: What is elemwidth?
[17:03:43] <juinn> pavonia: thank you
[17:03:46] <mkwia> pavonia, a variable.
[17:03:59] <juinn> pavonia: just seen your reply :)
[17:04:09] <pavonia> mkwia: Of course, but what is it set to?
[17:04:18] <pavonia> juinn: No problem
[17:04:30] <mkwia> pavonia, elemwidth = $( "#" + obj ).width();
[17:05:23] <pavonia> Could you make a minimal sample that shows the problem?
[17:35:26] <momomo> jquery jQuery('div') returns an array right?
[17:35:41] <momomo> Array.isArray(returned) returns false
[17:36:05] <momomo> what is the proper way to check if something is an array that passes even a jquery object
[17:36:10] <momomo> without juqery
[17:36:31] <momomo> Array.isArray($('div'))
[17:36:32] <momomo> false
[17:37:34] <momomo> why would Array.isArray(jQuery('div')) return false?? It's obviously an array
[17:39:52] <shoky_> momomo: it's not an array, it's "array-like". it has a .length property and indexed items, but doesn't inherit from Array prototype
[17:40:51] <momomo> shoky_: how is jquery able to get the inspector to show the object as an array rather than object
[17:40:53] <momomo> ?
[17:41:13] <shoky_> momomo: the inspector automatically does that for such array-like objects, iirc
[17:41:22] <shoky_> (sometimes...)
[17:42:17] <momomo> hmm ... but what would the proper way of iterating all array like objects ?
[17:42:24] <momomo> to determine if it is an array or not
[17:42:33] <momomo> without relying on jquery
[17:42:39] <shoky_> momomo: Array.from( arrayLikeObj )
[17:42:47] <momomo> the library references no jquery
[17:42:54] <momomo> shoky_: sounds expesie
[17:43:03] <momomo> expensive to check if it's an array
[17:43:09] <momomo> does that copy ?
[17:44:03] <momomo> isn't there a test for arraylike objecgts /
[17:44:05] <momomo> ?
[17:45:02] <shoky_> donno if it copies, i'd hope not but not sure
[17:45:15] <shoky_> what do you need to test that for
[17:46:56] <momomo> I need to find out if its an array to do some things
[17:47:41] <shoky_> don't think there's any built-in way to check for that
[17:48:32] <momomo> i can check for splice and length
[17:48:41] <momomo> i guess that'll have to do

[22:57:37] <sparxxx> Hi all! I'm having issues with jquery 3.1.1 and jquery ui 1.12.1 producing the error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'step' of undefined"
[22:58:49] <sparxxx> I thought it was my page, so I produced a test page: http://pastebin.com/FW3ZsiJs which produces the same error. I'm running Chrome 56
