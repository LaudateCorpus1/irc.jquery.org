[00:01:40] <arup_r> Talow: thanks
[00:01:56] <Talow> welcome.
[00:02:18] <arup_r> this is to set --         $("#wp_title").text(data.title);  .. how to clear the value ?
[00:02:43] <Uhkis> text('')
[00:03:13] <arup_r> Oh.. I was lookig for .clear();
[00:03:18] <arup_r> anyway thanks
[00:32:59] <IvanKuzev> hello, i am looking for a jquery extension to help me work with html5 canvas shapes and text and listen for events on them
[00:33:06] <IvanKuzev> any recomendations?
[00:39:31] <EGreg> hey all
[00:39:35] <EGreg> I'm using jQuery and running into a weird bug
[00:39:49] <EGreg> on touchscreens
[00:39:57] <EGreg> basically, on desktop everything is fine with mouse events, bubbles correctly
[00:40:19] <EGreg> but on touchscreens, the touchend event for some reason bubbles from the LI element, even though the actual target of the touch is INSIDE the LI
[00:40:30] <EGreg> and its touchend handler never gets called!
[00:40:41] <EGreg> is there something in the spec about li elements that causes this?
[00:43:00] <EGreg> anyone?
[00:47:58] <IvanKuzev> DOnt know.. i think everybody is asleep in the mornings
[00:53:54] <EGreg> I can give u a url to test
[00:53:55] <EGreg> if u luike
[00:54:21] <IvanKuzev> not mobile here. wont be usefull
[00:55:07] <IvanKuzev> but you can give it anyway..atleast i can see if it works on another computer
[01:00:52] <arup_r> How can I refactor this https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/ca7c9d297019b51fbab4 ?
[01:00:56] <arup_r> hints please
[01:00:59] <arup_r> it is working
[01:16:39] <EGreg> Okay I will give it tomorrow
[01:21:21] <Uhkis> arup_r: why are you emptying all those values?
[01:21:33] <arup_r> Good question/
[01:22:27] <arup_r> there is a text box if someone put a link on it.. I am putting data inside those fields as you see.. if the text box link someone cleared.. so respective all fields has to be cleared out also
[01:23:45] <xebra> hi, I get the warning "Empty string passed to getElementById()" in Firefox, even "minimal" code triggers it (just a click event in the code and nothing else). I read other people complaining online. Is it a known bug? Thanks
[01:24:08] <Woet> xebra: share the code.
[01:25:20] <Woet> arup_r: use a class to empty all the fields and then foreach through the data, making the indexes the same name as the fields, to populate them
[01:25:35] <Uhkis> arup_r: so it's intentional if the data is empty, all the stuff gets emptied too?
[01:25:45] <xebra> Woet, wait a sec, I'm trying to isolate it as much as possible, and I see it's absurd. It's probably an incompatibility with something else. I'll come back in a while
[01:26:29] <arup_r> Uhkis: yes
[01:26:52] <arup_r> data is coming from backend controller..
[01:26:54] <Uhkis> xebra: you don't have $('#') in your code, do you?
[01:27:10] <arup_r> data can be empty or not empty
[01:28:41] <arup_r> Uhkis: you can see there I am doing ajax get request
[01:34:03] <xebra> Uhkis, no, I'm noticing that even basically NO CODE like jQuery(document).ready(console.log('logged!')); triggers it. I think it might be some extension or something in firefox, but it's weird because in other cases this doesn't happen
[01:34:13] <xebra> I'll keep investigating
[01:45:35] <xqo> is loading data with workers a bad idea? like if i have a huge database-like object in a file, dictionary.js, is it bad form to load that with workers at the top of my main script, or should I stick to just loading all my database-like files with a <script> tag each?
[01:46:20] <Woet> xqo: how is it relevant to jquery?
[01:50:11] <Xatenev> xqo: gave u an answer on this in ##javascript
[01:50:35] <xqo> yes, thank you.
[02:04:51] <arup_r> is `paste` event out of the box in Jquery? http://stackoverflow.com/a/1503425/2767755

[02:12:00] <kokut> Hello, $('.img').slideDown('slow', function(){console.log('animation complete');}); is not animating the image, am i missing something? it has bootstrap class img-responsive and hidden-xs
[02:13:53] <kokut> nvm fixd it
[02:20:01] <xebra> ok, I found the origin of the problem, and I'll ignore it. Basically it's caused by Boostrap (old version I think). The weird thing is that these warnings don't appear on another website, which uses the same Bootstrap js. I'll ignore it, since everything (my code) seems to work.
[02:41:51] <kokut> Anyone knows an alternative to jquery's animate that doesnt bounce the element up'n down?
[02:50:01] <kokut> nvm fixedit
[02:55:07] <kokut> what i dont understand is why the animation is only working once
[03:18:47] <xebra> hi, need some advice. I have a form that should have "duplicable" fields. I use clone(true,true) to make sure I have a "deep" copy, but still the copy doesn't behave like the original. What am I gonna lose with a clone?
[04:13:10] <dimi1947> in backbone when I want to access an element of the DOM I use the event object...this available of course aftern an event is triggered<click etc>...is there any way I can acess it when the page just refreshes?
[04:15:05] <dimi1947> I want to access the event object through the parse function which is called on page refresh  https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/v6vujo86/35/
[04:15:23] <dimi1947> line 8
[04:22:45] <Xatenev1> Yo I got a weird problem

[04:28:38] <Deltanic> how does jquery handle empty jsonp responses? it seems like this still somehow calls JSON.parse(""), causing a syntax error
[04:28:48] <Deltanic> but the jsonp callback is never fired so how does that work?
[04:29:39] <Starcraftmazter> hi, is anyone familiar with datatables?
[04:30:17] <Starcraftmazter> i have datatables in conjunction with 3 drop downs, and i want their selections to narrow down the data, but im not sure how to accomplish this. Is there a way to specify searching accoridng to some specific attribute (ie. data-search-field1) or something?
[04:56:03] <titii> How to get input element in the UI autocomplete? Because this data of source doesnt works, $( "#formAddarticle-znacka" ).autocomplete({source: $(this).data('source')...
[05:16:21] <decx> any drawbacks to using data() to exchange data between unrelated scopes? http://jsfiddle.net/k6smxfq3/
[05:38:54] <Fogest> decx, shouldn't be as long as you can assume whatever you are attaching your data() to will always be there which in this case it looks like it should :)
[07:06:03] <theRealAlexz> I'm trying to make my if statements work: http://jsfiddle.net/tyckr/dfh11gj1/2/
[07:06:34] <theRealAlexz> It's not activated
[07:07:43] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, what do you mean? When I click on the books button it shows up saying books, and same for ebooks. What is hte issue?
[07:08:32] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: I want it to push the #pushdiv1 respectively #pushdiv2
[07:12:24] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, well I mean the problem is that .readmore is hidden, thus the divs visible within it are hidden even if you show them.
[07:12:40] <Fogest> Your #pushdiv's are within .readmore
[07:12:50] <Fogest> You can't see them because .readmore is hidden still
[07:13:12] <Fogest> I think you instead when to hide #pushdiv1 and #pushdiv2 from the css, not .readmore
[07:14:32] <theRealAlexz> thank you Fogest
[07:15:00] <theRealAlexz> Either that, or I will give the readmore to the #pushdiv1 id.
[07:17:49] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, up to you how you want to do it.
[07:45:08] <notchris> Hello

[07:45:27] <notchris> I’m trying to use https://github.com/jfhovinne/jFeed
[07:57:22] <converge> is there a way to replace some character when the user type ? for example, if he types: "12.34/56-78" I want to delete the characters " . / and - "
[07:58:19] <randomguy1> converge: you could have a keyup event check which key was pressed, and if it was one of those, prevent default to ignore it
[08:01:28] <converge> randomguy1: nice, I do ignore it in the script, how could I do to show the result on screen ? .append() or .html() or something like tat?
[08:02:04] <randomguy1> converge: if your ignoring it as they type it won't show up in their textfield
[08:04:57] <ozette> how does the jquery library make jQuery and $ global? all functions and variable names seem encapsulated in the source

[09:27:25] <delboy1978uk> any good equal height plugins?
[09:27:45] <delboy1978uk> i have 2 floating divs, the first is bigger than the 2nd
[10:05:36] <theRealAlexz> I can't make my jquery-script to continue when I have clicked a link: http://jsfiddle.net/tyckr/dfh11gj1/7/
[10:08:19] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, hello again :)
[10:08:42] <theRealAlexz> hello Fogest :) I didn't think you would still be present :))
[10:08:44] <arc_> theRealAlexz one of your ids in html has # before it. i don't think that's the problem but you should fix that
[10:09:00] <theRealAlexz> arc_ of course! thank you
[10:09:03] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, Don't you need to clear the data() element
[10:09:16] <delboy1978uk> why can’t i set the height of my boxes? http://jsbin.com/miqezoveqa/1/edit?js,output
[10:09:27] <Fogest> arc_, haha all those extra people you mentioned :P
[10:09:35] <arc_> also, you cannot have multiple elements with the same id
[10:09:50] <arc_> there are multiple links here with the same id
[10:10:00] <arc_> Fogest huh? o_O
[10:10:41] <Fogest> arc_, I see a bunch of extra names after your message, maybe my client just messed up
[10:10:51] <arc_> yeah, i think it did ;)
[10:10:51] <delboy1978uk> oops ignore that. schoolboy error
[10:11:02] <Fogest> arc_, ah yes it did :P
[10:11:33] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, what exactly is your goal with this program?
[10:12:04] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: I realize I'm too tired programming with this now, too many mistakes. Hang on.
[10:12:22] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: The goal is essentially, to nestle an interaction with links
[10:12:32] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, okay because it seems like this could be done in a much easier way
[10:12:38] <arc_> i agree
[10:12:44] <theRealAlexz> That is, if you click on books, you will be served a link with ebooks
[10:13:01] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, It will give you a link, or pop up a box that contains a link?
[10:13:17] <theRealAlexz> and if you click on ebooks, you will be served book-link, and if you have clicked both of them it will throw an else.
[10:13:32] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: just showing a div that is on the page.
[10:13:34] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, what does the else do?
[10:13:43] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, show both of them?
[10:13:53] <theRealAlexz> show a third link that has nothing to do with ebooks and books
[10:14:28] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, so after they have clicked both of them a 3rd div will show up? And only one of these divs can be shown at a time?
[10:14:52] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: yes
[10:15:12] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, would you mind if I throw together an example of a different way you could do this?
[10:15:19] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: not at all
[10:15:31] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, okay I'll get back to you in about ~5 minutes
[10:15:35] <autrilla> Can you set onclicks to text with jquery?
[10:15:48] <robertmaxrees> autrilla you can use .on(), yes.
[10:15:57] <robertmaxrees> you should avoid using onclick in your html though
[10:16:00] <theRealAlexz> thank you Fogest
[10:16:11] <Meir`> autrilla, use <span id="some_id"> inside the text
[10:16:17] <autrilla> robertmaxrees: yeah I meant on("click", blah)
[10:16:24] <robertmaxrees> autrilla yeah, you can do that.
[10:16:27] <Meir`> then you can do $("#some_id").click
[10:16:30] <robertmaxrees> err, wait.
[10:16:37] <robertmaxrees> to text, autrilla?
[10:16:38] <autrilla> Meir`: why give them ids?
[10:16:41] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[10:16:53] <autrilla> it's dynamically generated, I'm not going to give them ids
[10:17:02] <cotalinux> hello
[10:17:07] <cotalinux> how can I submit a form?
[10:17:09] <cotalinux> https://dpaste.de/TCmV#L5
[10:17:10] <autrilla> https://gist.github.com/autrilla/358a12b0f1851ebe613b
[10:17:27] <Meir`> autrilla, so class
[10:17:27] <robertmaxrees> cotalinux wrong way to handle that.
[10:17:35] <autrilla> As you can see lis have uls inside them. I want onclicks on just the text on the li, not on the uls too
[10:17:41] <robertmaxrees> cotalinux is the form_submit_btn within the form itself?
[10:17:42] <Meir`> autrilla, if you want bind something to text, you must wrap it inside some DOM element.
[10:17:47] <cotalinux> yes
[10:17:56] <autrilla> A span, I guess
[10:18:00] <Meir`> yeah
[10:18:04] <robertmaxrees> cotalinux then you want $('form').on('submit', function(e) {}); instead.
[10:18:09] <cotalinux> I need to add a hidden input with a value before form submission
[10:18:10] <Meir`> maybe span class="click"
[10:18:27] <robertmaxrees> cotalinux easy - mind setting up a quick jsfiddle?
[10:18:46] <autrilla> But I don't need ids :p
[10:19:11] <Meir`> autrilla, as i said, instead of unique ids, you can use the same class
[10:19:20] <autrilla> Or no class
[10:19:34] <Meir`> or maybe a nested selector
[10:19:49] <Meir`> like $("#divId span")
[10:20:22] <Meir`> then same event will be binded to all spans
[10:20:33] <robertmaxrees> why use IDs at all in this case?
[10:20:58] <Meir`> forget about ids
[10:21:23] <Meir`> i thought he wants to bind unique events to unique texts
[10:21:35] <autrilla> Like $("#drawer > ul > li > span")
[10:21:40] <robertmaxrees> also, the original problem was that there were duplicated IDs.
[10:21:52] <Meir`> robertmaxrees, are you talking to me?
[10:21:57] <arc_> that was for someone else
[10:22:06] <Meir`> heh
[10:22:06] <robertmaxrees> theRealAlexz
[10:24:04] <autrilla> You can't get the type of an object? Does JS suck that much?
[10:24:22] <robertmaxrees> autrilla js types are funky.
[10:24:25] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to get?
[10:24:34] <Fogest> theRealAlexz,  how about this: http://jsfiddle.net/Fogest/cL5hvajr/1/ ?
[10:24:36] <autrilla> The type of $(this)
[10:24:37] <robertmaxrees> note: arrays are actually objects, just with some special rules :)
[10:24:47] <autrilla> Arrays are also objects in python
[10:24:54] <autrilla> And you can still get their type
[10:24:57] <robertmaxrees> autrilla ah, you want to know if $(this) is an instanceof jquery i'm guessing?
[10:25:09] <autrilla> No, I want to know what $(this) is.
[10:25:18] <robertmaxrees> autrilla it's going to be an object.
[10:25:27] <autrilla> That's why JS's "oop" sucks
[10:25:35] <robertmaxrees> that's why you don't do OOP in JS in the first place ;)
[10:25:50] <autrilla> So I'm supposed to guess what $(this) is?
[10:26:00] <robertmaxrees> you know that $(this) will ALWAYS be an object that inherits from jquery, right?
[10:26:01] <robertmaxrees> always.
[10:26:17] <autrilla> Inherits from jquery? what?
[10:26:31] <Meir`> autrilla, it's a jquery instance
[10:26:43] <autrilla> is jquery a class?
[10:26:45] <cotalinux> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/hL2zL8m9/ does this help?
[10:26:45] <robertmaxrees> when you do $(this), you're actually running a constructor that's spitting back out a "jquery object"
[10:26:48] <Meir`> the dollar '$' is a simple class name
[10:26:48] <autrilla> Well, not like js has classes
[10:26:54] <robertmaxrees> the resulting object has jquery as its prototype.
[10:27:12] <Meir`> autrilla, yeah
[10:27:31] <robertmaxrees> autrilla so when you do $(this) you effectively have a "new jquery object"
[10:27:37] <Meir`> writing $(this) is the same as writing jQuery(this)
[10:27:39] <autrilla> robertmaxrees: ok. What can it do?
[10:27:47] <robertmaxrees> autrilla run all the jquery methods.
[10:27:57] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/
[10:28:00] <autrilla> Why does it complain when I try to do [0].on("click...?
[10:28:02] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, does it work?
[10:28:08] <robertmaxrees> because [0] is the underlying DOM node.
[10:28:20] <robertmaxrees> you want .eq(0), which returns what you want.
[10:28:30] <autrilla> So much for descriptive names
[10:28:40] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain it pretty well :)
[10:28:54] <autrilla> I'm sure they do. It's an obscure name anyway.
[10:29:05] <robertmaxrees> what would you propose instead?
[10:29:17] <robertmaxrees> that there is a jquery object that contains jquery objects?
[10:29:54] <autrilla> No, I'd propose a sane method name
[10:29:58] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[10:30:14] <autrilla> .getItemAtIndex(int index)
[10:30:22] <autrilla> Maybe even getItem(int i)
[10:30:26] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't often need to access things by index imo.
[10:30:49] <robertmaxrees> but you could put in a ticket at the repo with that suggestion :)
[10:31:05] <arc_> what is eq actually supposed to mean
[10:31:14] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[10:31:22] <robertmaxrees> "Description: Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index."
[10:31:31] <arc_> i know what it does but what does the name mean
[10:31:38] <robertmaxrees> "equal" i'm assuming.
[10:31:49] <arc_> i don't get that
[10:31:57] <autrilla> It makes no sense
[10:32:00] <arc_> but i don't really care if it's a descriptive name or not :p
[10:32:16] <robertmaxrees> i don't necessarily disagree that the name isn't entirely sensible, but i also don't think you should be accessing things by explicit index often in the first place.
[10:32:48] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: I was AFK, will dive into it now
[10:33:01] <autrilla> It's always going to be the first item, is there a reason not to access it by index?
[10:33:03] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, okay, let me know if it works :)
[10:33:09] * autrilla doesn't like JS
[10:33:18] <robertmaxrees> autrilla you don't need to specify and index at all.
[10:33:19] * Fogest likes JS\
[10:33:20] <robertmaxrees> *an
[10:33:47] <autrilla> What I dislike the most is the lack of support for other languages in browsers
[10:34:19] <robertmaxrees> i actually like javascript.  the DOM apis have their problems, but the language itself is largely pretty "OK"
[10:34:31] <autrilla> The OOP part SUCKS.
[10:34:39] <arc_> it's always going to be the first item? how about first() then
[10:34:40] <autrilla> It's not proper OOP
[10:34:45] <robertmaxrees> right, don't do OO in JS.
[10:34:46] <robertmaxrees> ever.
[10:34:48] <snover> uh
[10:34:49] <snover> wut
[10:35:03] <robertmaxrees> target a more functional approach imo.
[10:35:07] <snover> prototypal inheritance is most certainly ‘proper’ oo
[10:35:18] <robertmaxrees> eeeh... sort of.  it's more like "behavior delegation"
[10:35:22] <autrilla> snover: eh... everything being an object and only an object is not proper OO
[10:35:26] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't do what people think it does.
[10:35:49] <autrilla> type $("foo") should return jquery. Not 'object'.
[10:35:52] <snover> sorry how is everything being an object not object-oriented programming?
[10:36:05] <robertmaxrees> autrilla you mean OOP or "classical inheritance"?
[10:36:07] <autrilla> snover: everything being _only_ an instance of object.
[10:36:18] <robertmaxrees> autrilla you're conflating things btw :)
[10:36:20] <snover> instanceof is the operator for instances
[10:36:38] <autrilla> snover: so I'm supposed to check instanceof against every single object?
[10:36:45] <robertmaxrees> autrilla why are you checking at all?
[10:36:57] <autrilla> Because I want to know what the object is?
[10:37:01] <snover> no, you are supposed to look for APIs that are structurally compatible with whatever you want to call
[10:37:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:37:23] <autrilla> So I'm supposed to read the docs for EVERYTHING
[10:37:31] <robertmaxrees> after a while, you don't need to.
[10:37:34] <robertmaxrees> you're able to figure it out.
[10:37:38] <snover> you’re complaining about all dynamic languages
[10:37:40] <snover> if you want static typing, use typescript
[10:37:45] <autrilla> snover: no.
[10:37:48] <autrilla> I like python.
[10:37:53] <arc_> well ... i don't think the language can really be blamed if you don't know the language well enough to do what you want to do in it
[10:38:05] <autrilla> In python type(Foo()) returns Foo, not 'object'
[10:38:18] <robertmaxrees> autrilla you're conflating things again.
[10:38:30] <snover> Foo().constructor -> Foo
[10:38:53] <autrilla> But why is type() 'object'?
[10:38:59] <robertmaxrees> *typeof btw
[10:39:00] <autrilla> Sure it's an object, but we know that already
[10:39:03] <autrilla> Everything is an object
[10:39:08] <robertmaxrees> welcome to JS :)
[10:39:25] <autrilla> An umpleasant one
[10:39:29] <autrilla> unpleasant*
[10:39:45] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.  the language is fine as long as you don't try to treat it like a classical language.
[10:39:57] <autrilla> Yeah. Like PHP.
[10:40:10] <robertmaxrees> or Python.  Or Ruby.
[10:40:24] <autrilla> Nah, I was just quoting PHP devs
[10:40:28] <snover> autrilla: typeof is for checking primitive types
[10:40:37] <snover> string, number, boolean, object, function
[10:40:40] <autrilla> "PHP is fine as long as you use it like you should"
[10:40:53] <autrilla> snover: so what's the thing to check the real type? Not the primitive.
[10:40:58] <snover> instanceof
[10:41:07] <autrilla> s/check/get
[10:41:16] <Meir`> snover, it's a genereal JS issue
[10:41:20] <snover> the `constructor` property
[10:41:21] <Meir`> sorry
[10:41:25] <Meir`> autrilla &
[10:41:35] <autrilla> It is, yes
[10:41:43] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why people get so stuck on this point.  stop treating JS like a classical OO language.
[10:42:04] <autrilla> Because it is supposed to be OO
[10:42:07] <robertmaxrees> it is?
[10:42:09] <robertmaxrees> according to whom?
[10:42:11] <autrilla> Yes.
[10:42:13] <snover> it *is*.
[10:42:25] <snover> not using classes does not make a language not object oriented. it uses objects.
[10:42:39] <robertmaxrees> snover the issue with his statement is that he's conflating OOP with Classical inheritance.
[10:42:42] <autrilla> snover: it is not until you answer my question. How do you get the type of an object instance?
[10:42:44] <snover> therefore it is an object oriented programming language. in fact it is *more* object oriented than class-based languages since there is no differentiation between a type and any other object
[10:42:49] <snover> autrilla: i just told you twice
[10:42:50] <autrilla> robertmaxrees: no, I'm not.
[10:42:51] <Meir`> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/332422/how-do-i-get-the-name-of-an-objects-type-in-javascript
[10:42:55] <robertmaxrees> autrilla yeah, you are though.
[10:42:57] <snover> the constructor property of an object refers to the constructor (type) that created the object
[10:42:59] <dcherman2> besides, classes is a poor argument since ES6 has classes defined
[10:43:05] <dcherman2> which is just sugar for existing constructs
[10:43:06] <autrilla> snover: .constructor?
[10:43:11] <snover> yes
[10:43:17] <snover> the constructor property of any object refers to the constructor that created it
[10:43:21] <robertmaxrees> dcherman2 except the class keyword is just syntactic sugar for constructors, so it's still not the same :)
[10:43:28] <snover> assuming it was, in fact, created by a constructor, and not by e.g. Object.create
[10:43:36] <autrilla> snover: eh... $("div").constructor is a function
[10:43:39] <dcherman2> robertmaxrees: ya, i'm aware ( and said as much )
[10:43:51] <robertmaxrees> dcherman2 i know, just clarifying for those keeping score :)
[10:43:58] <autrilla> typeof is useless.
[10:44:14] <snover> you just want to complain
[10:44:20] <autrilla> yes.
[10:44:25] <autrilla> Because there's reasons for it.
[10:44:44] <snover> there is one reason, which is that you don’t yet understand how prototypical inheritance works
[10:44:53] <autrilla> I do.
[10:44:57] <autrilla> typeof is still useless.
[10:45:08] <robertmaxrees> yep.  you also rarely need to use it.
[10:45:35] <snover> autrilla: go read: https://gist.github.com/csnover/eb8ef0bbfac0329bbca5
[10:46:11] <autrilla> So you're supposed to code just by looking at docs? You don't trust code completion or any of that stuff because it can't know what the object is?
[10:46:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:46:30] <arc_> -_-;
[10:46:31] <robertmaxrees> i can look at the open and infer types just fine.
[10:46:35] <robertmaxrees> *object
[10:46:45] <autrilla> You can?
[10:46:54] <dcherman2> if you want code completion, then you want TypeScript.
[10:46:56] <autrilla> What editor do you use/
[10:46:58] <snover> autrilla: that is the case for all languages that have dynamic objects. you can add any property to any object at any time and so you can’t know it.
[10:47:05] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: It is elegant but the nested linking which I was looking for wasn't included in the code. E.g. that you are able to continue to open up divs in this script: $(".questioncard").hide();
[10:47:07] <dcherman2> what you want *may* come in ES7 with type annotations.
[10:47:10] <autrilla> snover: python has code completion.
[10:47:26] <snover> you can enforce some rules to make it possible to guess that some object probably has certain properties but it’s not a guarantee that it is all properties.
[10:47:35] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, What do you mean continue to open up divs?
[10:47:48] <autrilla> snover: of course it isn't, yeah. But you can guess, a guess is better than nothing
[10:47:55] <arc_> maybe i'm misunderstanding, but how can a language have code completion? isn't that the editor's job?
[10:47:57] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: http://jsfiddle.net/tyckr/Lnpqad64/
[10:48:00] <autrilla> And surely it's pretty tough if you can't get the class of an object instance
[10:48:12] <autrilla> arc_: languages can help
[10:48:15] <robertmaxrees> autrilla so your problem is code autocompletion?
[10:48:15] <snover> you can guess in js just as well as anything else. and as I believe I already said if you want static typing then use typescript
[10:48:27] <autrilla> robertmaxrees: no, but it'd be something nice to have
[10:48:28] <snover> as well as anything else dynamic*
[10:48:44] <autrilla> I don't dislike dynamic
[10:48:54] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: In this case, I would continue to code info in the html. I will do it now for five minutes. :)
[10:48:55] <robertmaxrees> autrilla great, use an editor that has it.  plenty of IDEs and Editors offer packages to give you completion.
[10:49:00] <autrilla> As I said, I love python. It's dynamic, but you can get the type of any object at runtime
[10:49:20] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, okay
[10:49:24] <snover> autrilla: are you going to read what i sent you?
[10:49:34] <autrilla> snover: maybe. Is it worth it?
[10:50:17] <BlueShark> Hi.
[10:50:20] <snover> autrilla: no, i only send unhelpful information to people.
[10:50:27] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha snover
[10:50:53] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, yeah I still don't understand what you want even form the new fiddle :P
[10:51:14] <autrilla> This type of inheritance is very simple and powerful:
[10:51:19] <autrilla> Why is it powerful?
[10:51:25] <BlueShark> I have two div blocks, and I'd like to display a loading gif for each one of them. What's the way to go about it? .load?
[10:51:27] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, are you saying you want to hide the books part if they clicked on books?
[10:52:05] <arc_> the colon seems to indicate that it will explain the answer to that question
[10:52:07] <robertmaxrees> BlueShark you could set the contents of them with .html()
[10:52:27] <autrilla> snover: also, there's some errors in that text. "In class-based languages, you typically cannot modify the properties or methods of a class at runtime.". Sure you can.
[10:52:28] <BlueShark> I'm reading the contents from an API endpoint that returns JSON output, and then use parseJSON to parse it. As I understand it, .load requires the endpoint to output markup right?
[10:53:14] <robertmaxrees> BlueShark you don't want .load() in this case it sounds like.
[10:53:40] <BlueShark> robertmaxrees, I want this gif to cover the divs (two gifs; one for each div), i.e. the div should not be seen, just the gif.
[10:53:46] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:54:13] <robertmaxrees> BlueShark so you use .html() to write in the image, then replace the contents of each div in the .done() callback.
[10:54:37] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: =) People will be able to read about books and ebooks. If they click ebooks, they will at the end of the paragraph be able to read about books.
[10:54:48] <theRealAlexz> be able to click and read about books
[10:54:49] <theRealAlexz> *
[10:55:17] <autrilla> Hmmmm https://github.com/PythonJS/PythonJS
[10:55:25] <theRealAlexz> if they click books, they will at the end of the paragraph be able to click on a link about ebooks.
[10:56:29] <robertmaxrees> theRealAlexz where's that fiddle again?
[10:56:33] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, so hang on, it sounds like you just want to use anchor links in html and link to the element. What is the point of using jquery in this case?
[10:56:56] <theRealAlexz> and if someone for example click on ebooks while reading about books, they will not be served a link back to ebooks, which is the else-statement that will show "a way out".
[10:57:26] <BlueShark> robertmaxrees, This is what I have now. Not sure what you mean. http://jsfiddle.net/bv8qrwho/
[10:58:03] <theRealAlexz> it's more like a conversational interaction Fogest, you will choose the readingpath, not scrolling up and down on a page.
[10:58:07] <robertmaxrees> BlueShark woah.
[10:58:21] <robertmaxrees> BlueShark first off, i wouldn't use setinterval here.
[10:58:44] <BlueShark> robertmaxrees, noob here, all critisicmm welcome :D
[10:59:03] <BlueShark> what then?
[10:59:31] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:00:03] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, ah okay. Maybe someone else here can help you get to that kind of point. I unfortunately am out of time to help with this :/. Good luck though!
[11:00:30] <theRealAlexz> thanks Fogest =)
[11:04:30] <robertmaxrees> crap my brain is broken today.
[11:05:42] <BlueShark> You're not alone :P
[11:07:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/bv8qrwho/1/ i know this isn't the optimal way to do this.
[11:07:58] <robertmaxrees> but my brain is broken.
[11:08:37] <robertmaxrees> the reason you use setTimeout instead of setting an interval is because you cannot guarantee that the ajax request completes in time for the interval.
[11:08:43] <robertmaxrees> so you need to explicitly call the timeout instead.
[11:13:15] <robertmaxrees> derp http://jsfiddle.net/bv8qrwho/2/
[11:13:18] <robertmaxrees> this is what you really want.
[11:14:10] <decx> the hell is $(fireAjax)
[11:14:24] <robertmaxrees> $(function() {});
[11:14:36] <robertmaxrees> a super terse way to pass a function to document ready ;)
[11:14:37] <decx> oh like a shorter hand
[11:14:43] <decx> shorter than shorthand
[11:14:54] <decx> some might call it littlefinger
[11:15:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha asure.
[11:19:16] <tads421> hi all, i have a slidetoggle on my page but i need the submenu to stay open if i click a link in the submenu (the submenu to stay open).... i have the js getting the id of the mastermenu but im unsure on how to make that mastermenu open when i click a link in the sub menu. if you get what i mean... https://jsfiddle.net/3ney9y7k/
[11:21:07] <decx> let's start at line 2 ok
[11:21:15] <decx> there is no .sub-menu after .mainmenu

[11:22:02] <pauled> getting trouble to get the list in arry
[11:22:05] <pauled> arrey*
[11:22:23] <decx> you want to highlight friends in teh spec list?
[11:22:24] <robertmaxrees> pauled you want .map() for this/.
[11:22:54] <tads421> sorry... just updated the link
[11:22:56] <pauled> yes I want to put a css on the word are matched
[11:23:36] <robertmaxrees> pauled http://fiddle.jshell.net/n5qu67p2/2/
[11:24:39] <pauled> thanks robertmaxrees :)
[11:24:45] <decx> you should have that data already
[11:24:51] <decx> why map again
[11:25:13] <robertmaxrees> he has two separate boxes he's trying to match the username highlighing on.
[11:25:17] <robertmaxrees> *highlighting
[11:25:24] <decx> well sure but the server is already sptting out that list
[11:25:39] <robertmaxrees> this is all client-side for him.
[11:25:39] <decx> oh is that for a userscript again
[11:25:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:25:46] <decx> on that chess site
[11:25:48] <decx> or what it was
[11:25:57] <robertmaxrees> tads421 https://jsfiddle.net/3ney9y7k/7/
[11:26:43] <pauled> I didn't saw this. that's true, there is a preload for friendbox <div id="friend_box" data-preload="trojan03,Shahmatti,komar7,SketchTurner,penandpaper,Planteur-Citron,winstonchills,Sasqwatch,XPJ-v134,Gezal,boom007,OrangeSpaceDrink,FM ZibbitVideos">
[11:27:04] <robertmaxrees> then use that.
[11:27:16] <decx> ha!
[11:27:44] <decx> either way you each through your watchers and indexOf againts the array
[11:27:52] <robertmaxrees> $('#friend_box').data('preload').split(',');
[11:29:10] <Insentience> there's this input button with a set onclick function. how am i able to add my own 'onclick' function that is guaranteed to run before the first onclick function?
[11:29:11] <pauled> I think I have to use the first way you gave robertmaxrees to array the watchers?
[11:29:40] <robertmaxrees> Insentience you can't.
[11:30:17] <pauled> oh nevermind, I guess I have to use match perhaps against the watcher
[11:30:36] <robertmaxrees> Insentience you'd have to remove the original binding, add yours, then *re add* the original binding using .on()
[11:30:42] <robertmaxrees> something really awkward like that.
[11:31:31] <Insentience> robertmaxrees: that is what i imagined the solution would look like, https://jsfiddle.net/0o54n8fs/
[11:31:38] <Insentience> this isn't working for me, however
[11:31:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to remove the original binding, too.
[11:31:57] <Insentience> event.data.submit()
[11:31:59] <Insentience> that is a typo
[11:32:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/0o54n8fs/1/
[11:32:16] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[11:33:03] <tads421> @robertmaxress http://m-w-m.co.uk/slide/ this is the code live.... when i click the link1 master and then page 2 i need to keep link1 master open after page2 loads.
[11:33:23] <robertmaxrees> tads421 then you want either AJAX or you need your server to control that.
[11:34:16] <tads421> oh right ok
[11:51:23] <theRealAlexz> Fogest: This is essentially the behavior I wanted to do: http://jsfiddle.net/tyckr/dfh11gj1/
[11:51:35] <theRealAlexz> just run the script and see how it behaves
[11:51:49] <theRealAlexz> e.g. the coding is surely horrible, but it works now.
[11:52:39] <Fogest> theRealAlexz, I am busy right now but I could try and give you a cleaner version of what you want later today. Will you be on later? If not I can email you? If you'd like me to email you just PM me your email :)
[11:52:59] <robertmaxrees> err.
[11:53:03] <robertmaxrees> that defeats the purpose of the channel :(
[11:53:57] <Fogest> Well I don't mind if someone else helps him, I just don't know if he'll be on later.
[11:54:01] <Insentience> i want to .each() across an element's comment nodes. is that possible?
[11:54:19] <robertmaxrees> not really, Insentience
[11:54:33] <Insentience> hmm, well looping across them in any way
[11:54:48] <robertmaxrees> not without some really gross finagling.  why do you want the comments?
[11:55:15] <pauled> getting many error http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/n5qu67p2/6/
[11:55:16] <Insentience> that is a good question
[11:55:31] <Insentience> i dont want to answer it, i think i will look for a better solution
[11:55:34] <robertmaxrees> pauled open your console - you have a syntax error.
[11:56:35] <pauled> yes it say missing ')' but I don't see where
[11:56:57] <robertmaxrees> right - double-check your opening braces and parens.
[11:57:02] <robertmaxrees> figre it out like we would :)
[11:57:31] <ozette> shoky: thanks :-)
[11:58:25] <ozette> makes sense now
[11:58:53] <ozette> return the variable to the window
[12:04:37] <decx> what's a fuction?
[12:04:50] <decx> is that like a fuck ton in italian?
[12:06:27] <pauled> I don't see why jshint say missing semicolon in line 19: http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/n5qu67p2/9/
[12:06:50] <decx> fuction
[12:06:55] <snover> because it can’t get over your syntax error
[12:07:11] <robertmaxrees> function, not fuction
[12:07:17] <pauled> oh right :) fuction
[12:07:22] <pauled> haha
[12:07:34] <robertmaxrees> also, onlineFriends is used out of scope.
[12:07:46] <decx> also this.text()
[12:07:58] <decx> you should not be making these mistakes anymore
[12:08:05] <robertmaxrees> ^ agreed

[12:14:26] <snobber> what's the best way of comparing MVC frameworks?

[12:14:44] <arthurvr> snobber: TodoMVC is a good starting point https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc :p
[12:15:05] <snobber> todo list's okay I'll check todomvc
[12:15:10] <NoiseEee> snobber: read blogs, check out that link ^^ (I guess), and just go aroud
[12:15:56] <snobber> is todomvc something well known? I just want to not spend time on non-reliable things.
[12:16:13] <NoiseEee> it is, but whether or not it makes your decision easier is <shrug>
[12:16:19] <NoiseEee> http://todomvc.com/
[12:16:50] <pauled> I turned in all directions. It's funny :) http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/n5qu67p2/12/
[12:16:55] <arthurvr> yeah TodoMVC is a starting point. You should build things yourself to know how it feels like.
[12:17:08] <snobber> arthurvr: can you link to me the official todomvc repo please?
[12:17:11] <NoiseEee> i'd say look at the github repos of the ones you're interested in, check out if there's action on them, do some reading on current JS blogs... choosing an MVC is the worst
[12:17:24] <arthurvr> snobber: uh? That’s the official one...
[12:17:39] <snobber> no it's a fork your nickname is there
[12:17:50] <arthurvr> snobber: I’m just a todomvc team member that’s why my nick is there :p
[12:17:56] <snobber> oh sorry
[12:19:09] <snobber> which ones should I start with
[12:19:50] <arthurvr> I think you should have a decent look at the ones on the first tab of todomvc.com. Those are the more popular well known things. The other tabs are things we’re just experimenting with.
[12:20:04] <arthurvr> but again don’t limit you to todomvc of course I was just linking up one thing

[12:42:55] <decx> what was it called again
[12:50:18] <DietDrK> I'd like http://jsfiddle.net/hqfheq9q/ to return a pretty array
[12:50:44] <DietDrK> I can't figure out how to add the result of serializeArray to an already existing associative_array/object
[12:51:10] <DietDrK> I'd like a result more like: "{"Action":"RequestGraph","GraphPID":"1","UserID":"0"}"
[12:53:15] <DietDrK> Cleaned up a bit: http://jsfiddle.net/hqfheq9q/1/
[12:56:36] <DietDrK> http://jsfiddle.net/hqfheq9q/1/ I'm trying to combine the result of serializeArray() to an existing associative_array/object. The current output and the desired output are shown in the paste
[13:00:56] <pantsofchocolate> im having some trouble with using jquery and bootstrap for affix and offset anyone have experience with this?
[13:05:26] <Insentience> is it possible to have a jquery selector that simply looks for 'blank' divs? not empty divs, i mean divs without any changes. for instance, <div></div> would be found but <div style="etc"></div> would not
[13:05:41] <decx> DietDrK you're extending the array that holds a single object not the objet, so you need $.extend(Basic, asdf[0]) there
[13:08:35] <DietDrK> decx: That got me a bit closer. Now I added another input in the fieldset: http://jsfiddle.net/hqfheq9q/6/
[13:09:38] <decx> well loop it
[13:09:53] <DietDrK> I'm thinking a .each(function(){}); might do it, yeah?
[13:11:14] <decx> no idea, should the inputs be separate objects that both have the graph and user ids?
[13:11:39] <DietDrK> graph&UserID is for the page. It will never change. It needs to be sent with the AJAX Payload, though.
[13:12:34] <decx> and?
[13:12:40] <decx> what about the inputs?
[13:12:50] <decx> they cant be part of the same object now can they
[13:13:02] <DietDrK> Before I combined them into the same object:  "{"Action":"RequestGraph","GraphPID":"1","UserID":"0"}"
[13:14:44] <DietDrK> I think my best bet is to traverse the JS Array and append each name->value to payload by PayLoad[Name]=value;
[13:14:55] <DietDrK> I think conceptually, it's sort of a bad idea
[13:15:17] <DietDrK> It should be {unchanging data per session, {things related to the action requested} }
[13:15:17] <decx> no idea why you cant just post a the form
[13:15:36] <DietDrK> Then I'd have to throw in hidden inputs containing userID into every form
[13:15:48] <DietDrK> That's what I did before, now I'm trying to ease away from that
[13:16:08] <decx> you can add data to a serialized form
[13:17:49] <DietDrK> So i have this 'Basic' object. I would iterate through that and add it to the serializeArra() object?
[13:17:56] <OliPicard> Right I have a question about schemas with the kendo grid plugin for Jquery. Not sure if this is a good place to ask. I'm trying to figure out a way of navigating thru the schema.
[13:18:38] <decx> use serialize() on your form, then it's just a string where you can attach whatever other parameters and values you want to send
[13:22:56] <DietDrK> I'll try to figure that out now
[13:23:04] <pauled> how do not cache a variable that changes
[13:26:38] <pauled> can I use 'onlineFriends = ...' instead of 'var onlineFriends = ...'
[13:27:08] <NoiseEee> pauled: what do you mean by 'not cache'?  what kind of variable?
[13:27:17] <NoiseEee> pauled: unless you
[13:27:21] <Talow> var is used to define a variable, once it's been defined you do not need to use it again.
[13:28:13] <pauled> the var have data dynamicaly updated with websocket or something like
[13:28:26] <OliPicard> for example this YQL query, see my jsfiddle- http://jsfiddle.net/yrt0j1gx/ This is my first time doing anything related to JSON with Kendo grid.
[13:28:44] <pauled> I haded obeserveMutation on a element but the variable are static
[13:29:11] <NoiseEee> pauled:  just fetch the variable again  $(element)
[13:31:15] <DietDrK> Alright, I got this far: http://jsfiddle.net/hqfheq9q/7/
[13:31:28] <DietDrK> I have two objects in a similar format now
[13:33:30] <Talow> I think you might be looking for the .map functionality
[13:34:05] <Talow> DietDrK ^
[13:34:48] <DietDrK> Talow: Thanks. i feel like I just don't know the function names to look for. Appreciated!
[13:35:20] <Talow> I only know cuz I needed it not long ago ;)
[13:36:16] <DietDrK> This works: http://jsfiddle.net/2r494sd5/ but I'm just hacking around stuff, I feel
[13:38:25] <DietDrK> I stole someone else's   $.fn.serializeObject. I don't really understand what's going on here. but it's getting me a bit closer. http://jsfiddle.net/2r494sd5/1/ if anyone cares.
[13:40:11] <DietDrK> I think I need to study callbacks and syntax/common_usage in JS/JQ before using .map. I don't get lines 27-28 in http://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/
[13:41:09] <DietDrK> I don't get how there can be function ( n, i) when the variable they're applying it to is a 1-d array.
[13:42:12] <Talow> n = the key, i = item
[13:43:28] <shoky> n is the item here, i is the index
[13:43:37] <Talow> sorry yea
[13:53:15] <Talow> here's a fast example of how I used map in the past, not pretty but it gets the idea across I hope.
[13:53:15] <Talow> http://jsfiddle.net/engale/d6a42hmh/4/
[13:56:18] <DietDrK> I think I'll get to understanding it with time.
[13:57:23] <DietDrK> how long to jsfiddles stay up/
[13:57:31] <DietDrK> Do they exist before they're erased?
[14:00:18] <Talow> ?
[14:00:37] <DietDrK> Never mind. The answer to my question is: JSFiddle keeps all submissions forever.
[14:19:10] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, you have a minute?
[14:19:52] <decx> ask the bloody question
[14:20:25] <DietDrK> is there a bot in here for that?
[14:20:35] <DietDrK> !+survey or something?
[14:20:39] <claytonzaugg> hey
[14:20:48] <claytonzaugg> chill out, putting a jsfiddle together ;)
[14:21:10] <markholmes> his minute is up
[14:21:40] <decx> 2 even, on the second
[14:22:34] <claytonzaugg> lol
[14:22:54] <claytonzaugg> okay
[14:23:19] <claytonzaugg> so I'm trying to change the data from an AJAX get, but it's not updating the data with the revisions I'm trying to inject
[14:23:21] <claytonzaugg> http://jsfiddle.net/5czsfw0e/
[14:23:38] <claytonzaugg> JS Fiddle isn't working, but you can see the code and hopefully understand what I'm trying to do
[14:24:50] <claytonzaugg> removed the comment: http://jsfiddle.net/5czsfw0e/1/
[14:25:39] <decx> $($html) creates a new object
[14:25:50] <claytonzaugg> ...fuh
[14:26:01] <decx> cache that then you can do stuff with it
[14:26:24] <decx> oh you already do
[14:26:28] <decx> why the double wrap then
[14:26:34] <decx> just $html.find
[14:26:45] <claytonzaugg> because it produces object
[14:26:51] <claytonzaugg> non-searchable
[14:26:59] <decx> it's searchable alright
[14:27:10] <claytonzaugg> well, lemme give you the error, one sec
[14:28:14] <claytonzaugg> Uncaught TypeError: $html.find is not a function
[14:29:06] <decx> oh right you do .html
[14:29:12] <claytonzaugg> line 22 is what I changed http://jsfiddle.net/5czsfw0e/2/
[14:29:15] <decx> well cache your jqueriefied object
[14:29:20] <claytonzaugg> okay
[14:30:06] <decx> or just lose the .html()
[14:30:18] <decx> in your initial $html = $(html)
[14:30:22] <claytonzaugg> so put a var revisedCode = $($html).find("#scriptContainer").html('<script> ' + optionsData + '</script>');
[14:30:41] <decx> no have you not listened?
[14:30:46] <decx> $() creates a new object
[14:30:50] <claytonzaugg> correct
[14:31:21] <claytonzaugg> sorry I'm interning and trying to understand these deeper js functions
[14:31:50] <claytonzaugg> I'm going to lost the .html() in the initial $html and see what happens.
[14:33:51] <claytonzaugg> decx, would you mind updating the jsfiddle so I can see what you are talking about? I just tried removing the initial .html() for $html and I'm getting [object object]
[14:34:05] <decx> i suggest you start looking at the objects that are being created
[14:34:16] <decx> that makes it all quite visible
[14:51:21] <gradymcd> Hello. I'm trying to wait for a function to execute before calling another function, but I can't get it to work. My code: https://gist.github.com/gradymcd/53e18b942346222df82d
[14:51:47] <robertmaxrees> gradymcd that's an issue with scope.
[14:52:00] <robertmaxrees> what is fileHandler()?
[14:52:26] <gradymcd> it takes a xlsx file and puts it into json
[14:52:33] <robertmaxrees> is it an ajax function call?
[14:53:43] <gradymcd> I'm not sure. This is the code for the function: https://gist.github.com/gradymcd/fb1e6e3d2b4568674e48
[14:54:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, okay, so that's not how deferreds work.
[14:54:50] <gradymcd> how would i do that then?
[14:55:14] <robertmaxrees> $.when() expects one or more deferred objects.  can't just feed it functions.
[14:55:56] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to just do this: http://fixee.org/paste/cjg340u/
[14:56:10] <robertmaxrees> oh, that registers a liostener.
[14:56:41] <robertmaxrees> this isn't doing what you think it is.
[14:57:06] <robertmaxrees> and you can't do json = fileHandler(e); in this case.
[14:57:46] <gradymcd> ok
[14:58:47] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to call another function when that onload runs?
[14:59:25] <decx> you put the callback in the loadend event
[14:59:28] <decx> or load in this case
[14:59:42] <gradymcd> im trying to call fileHandler and then return the json to the parse function
[14:59:44] <decx> loadend is safer tho
[15:00:05] <robertmaxrees> gradymcd you can't do it that way.  you need to use the callback and pass it around that way.
[15:00:24] <gradymcd> alright, thanks
[15:00:37] <decx> is that a drop or an input file?
[15:02:11] <gradymcd> decx, its input
[15:02:31] <decx> you would use it like this in your input event handler fileHandler(e, function(){ do stuff with this })
[15:02:51] <decx> when you call that callback is up to you
[15:03:03] <decx> either on every successful load or jsut after all have been completed
[15:32:34] <hd1> if I have a non-anonymous mouseOver function, what should I have, if anything as parameters?
[15:35:21] <shoky> hd1: if you mean a mouseover event handler, then like any event handler, you have the event as parameter. doesn't matter if it's anonymous or not
[15:36:31] <Poppabear> Whats the best way to keep a cache of html content that was received from a get response, this way it won't have to send a request every time but maybe clearing the cache after a browser refresh or after so much time passes ... i am not that familiar in this area, any reading material would be great also :P
[15:37:53] <shoky> you can keep it in a string.. the browser will clear it after a refresh
[15:38:13] <hd1> shoky: why isn't my mouseover being triggered then? http://hasan.d8u.us/links.js and the page it's supposed to be active on is http://links.d8u.us
[15:38:49] <shoky> hd1: first thing i see is $(document).ready(load());   which should be:  $(document).ready(load);
[15:39:05] <hd1> shoky: that doesn't work, full stop
[15:40:40] <Poppabear> shoky: you think this would be a resonable solution http://davidwalsh.name/cache-ajax ?
[15:41:08] <shoky> hd1: what doesn't?
[15:41:23] <Poppabear> other than the string solution which is a very resonable one also :P
[15:42:21] <gambl0re> which way is better? $('div > li').show(); or $('div').find('li').show();
[15:42:21] <hd1> ready(load)
[15:42:44] <Poppabear> gambl0re: my opinion is $('div').find('li').show();
[15:43:24] <shoky> Poppabear: that's fine, you can store the strings in an object if you want
[15:43:56] <Poppabear> is that all that is doing with a cacheHandler ? storing the string in an object ?
[15:43:58] <gambl0re> so it just depends on which way you like to do it? they're no advantages/disadvantages for using one over the other?
[15:44:09] <shoky> hd1:  it should work fine.  $(document).ready(load);   and  $('.link a').on("mouseover", mouseOver);
[15:44:20] <hd1> $(this) is empty :(
[15:44:32] <Poppabear> gambl0re: as far as i know, its just easier on the eyes :P
[15:44:36] <shoky> hd1: change it to what i said and let me see
[15:44:41] <hd1> it doesn't, shoky, but I got the working incantation
[15:44:44] <gambl0re> ok
[15:45:32] <shoky> Poppabear: yes it's storing them in an object. in his example it may not be just strings, but whatever type those "tweets" objects are
[15:46:35] <Poppabear> ok makes since.
[15:46:56] <Poppabear> i think i will just simply store them in a var then and let it be that simple
[15:47:13] <Poppabear> unless i find later that solution just won't work :P
[15:49:11] <shoky> hd1:  done: done(thePage)   is wrong..
[15:49:37] <hd1> shoky: what should it be?
[15:50:24] <hd1> done is a named function, shoky, look above it
[15:51:11] <Poppabear> done: should be success: done() ??
[15:52:02] <shoky> hd1: function mouseOver(evt) { var elem = $(this), thePage = $(this).text();  $.ajax{{... done: function(data) { elem.text(data); }})}
[15:52:54] <shoky> hd1:  when you do:    done: done(thePage)   it calls  done(thePage)  and puts the return value as the "done" option for $.ajax
[15:53:06] <hd1> shoky: I really don't like anonymous functions
[15:53:07] <shoky> it calls it immediately instead of when the ajax is done
[15:53:13] <shoky> hd1: it doesn't have to be anonymous
[15:53:45] <shoky> hd1:  function mouseOver(evt) { var elem = $(this), thePage = $(this).text();  $.ajax{{... done: done}); function done(data) { elem.text(data); } }
[15:53:54] <hd1> nor do i enjoy being spoonfed :(
[15:54:10] <shoky> hd1: i explained the problem..
[15:55:31] <Poppabear> hd1:  done: done(thePage)   is wrong.. shoky: what should it be? ............... <hd1> nor do i enjoy being spoonfed :(
[15:55:39] <Poppabear> sorry just thought it was funny :P
[15:55:43] <shoky> Poppabear:  it should be    done: done
[15:55:52] <shoky> done(thePage)  is not a function, it's a return value from a function call
[15:56:04] <Poppabear> oh
[15:56:33] <shoky> $.ajax({done: done(thePage)})   is exactly like:    var result = done(thePage);  $.ajax({done: result});
[15:56:54] <gambl0re> is this code wrong? http://i.imgur.com/qofn1PC.png
[15:57:03] <rcyr> TIL... the callback version of $.ajax has a 'done'
[15:57:05] <gambl0re> i copied and pasted the line but it's not working
[15:57:48] <rcyr> wth is that code.
[15:57:58] <Poppabear> gambl0re: thats ugly
[15:58:07] <rcyr> It's like 5 lines badly formatted.
[15:58:14] <Poppabear> ^ agree
[15:58:17] <rcyr> hmm.. 6 lines formatted into 5
[15:58:17] <gambl0re> i know its ugly....
[15:58:40] <hd1> should it not be success: done?
[15:58:41] <Poppabear> gambl0re: its hard to tell if its valid or not its that ugly
[15:59:00] <shoky> hd1:  "this" changes in function calls
[15:59:09] <gambl0re> this is the code on one line...$('#selected-plays li:not(.horizontal)').addClass('sublevel');li:not(.horizontal)').addClass('sub-level');
[15:59:19] <gambl0re> $('#selected-plays li:not(.horizontal)').addClass('sublevel');li:not(.horizontal)').addClass('sub-level');
[15:59:35] <shoky> gambl0re: that is bad code, not just ugly
[15:59:42] <Poppabear> :P
[15:59:50] <gambl0re> i dont understand why the author put another li:not after the first semicolon
[16:00:08] <shoky> Poppabear: did you buy the book?
[16:00:18] <Poppabear> no
[16:00:23] <shoky> (or is it free)
[16:00:41] <shoky> then don't complain if your pdf has such errors :P
[16:00:45] <Talow> ygwypf
[16:00:51] <Poppabear> thats not my book ? thats gambl0re :P
[16:00:59] <shoky> whoops sorry, meant gambl0re
[16:01:02] <Poppabear> lol
[16:01:27] <gambl0re> obviously i didnt buy it, downloaded the pdf..
[16:01:33] <gambl0re> but still...
[16:01:44] <shoky> then you don't really know if the author put it there
[16:02:14] <gambl0re> they did, you can download the code from their website
[16:02:15] <Poppabear> gambl0re: look at the code, understand what it is "trying" to do, and use basics to rip it apart and put it back together ....
[16:02:20] <Talow> the stuff after the ; is another command all together
[16:02:31] <shoky> gambl0re ok then it's a mistake/error. move on.
[16:02:37] <Talow> people use white spaces, compilers don't have to
[16:03:03] <gambl0re> i know how to rewrite it to make it work but i still want to understand what the original code is doing.
[16:03:16] <gambl0re> why is there another .addClass after the first semicolon
[16:03:19] <gambl0re> $('#selected-plays li:not(.horizontal)').addClass('sublevel');li:not(.horizontal)').addClass('sub-level');
[16:03:32] <gambl0re> aren't you just adding it twice?
[16:03:37] <gambl0re> i dont see any difference.
[16:03:39] <shoky> hd1: add to the ajax options:    context: this
[16:03:44] <gambl0re> except the selector
[16:03:48] <shoky> hd1: and it will keep the "this" in the success handler
[16:03:49] <hd1> ok, I'm now getting to the done function with the right data, how do I replace  the element the mouse was over when the function call was made?
[16:04:30] <hd1> will try, shoky
[16:04:40] <hd1> works thanks
[16:05:12] <hd1> kewl
[16:05:28] <hd1> ok... so that's just me being stupid/retarded/whatever :(
[16:05:35] <arc_> gambl0re well ... sublevel is not the same class as sub-level
[16:06:08] <arc_> (i don't know anything about what you're looking at other than that one line you just pasted)
[16:07:26] <gambl0re> it's supposed to be sub-level in both cases. i dont know why when i copied/pasted it removed the dash
[16:07:40] <gambl0re> should i just move on from this example?
[16:08:00] <gambl0re>  http://i.imgur.com/qofn1PC.png
[16:08:24] <gambl0re> compare the sub-level on both cases...same spelling
[16:12:09] <shoky> gambl0re: it's an error, ignore it
[16:19:29] <Poppabear> whats the best way to check if a key exists in an array ?
[16:21:25] <gambl0re> is it common to do something like this? $('div.horizontal:eq(1)')
[16:22:04] <Poppabear> its sudo code
[16:22:19] <Poppabear> rturns the 2nd item from a 0 based index
[16:22:37] <decx> generally you want to cache your collections, but if you just need it once then whatevs
[16:23:04] <rcyr> Poppabear: Is it an array? Or an object?
[16:23:43] <rcyr> (Usually.. when someone talks about "key", he/she means a dictionary/map structure... which would be an object in JS)
[16:24:01] <Poppabear> rcyr: well its an array with key value pairs, but let me ask .. if i simply check something like contentCache[name] and it doesn't exist, will it return null ?
[16:24:14] <rcyr> Poppabear: undefined.
[16:24:24] <rcyr> Poppabear: So, it's an object?
[16:24:25] <Poppabear> undefined as a string i assume ?
[16:24:34] <rcyr> No, the undefined "value"
[16:24:40] <Poppabear> ok
[16:25:06] <rcyr> Don't use an array for key/value.... don't use an object when you need an array
[16:26:23] <Poppabear> well this is my goal, at doc ready it will init an empty object or array, then when content is requested it will simply push the key value to the object/array ... then i can check if the content has already been added i can simply pull the stored results instead of sending another request ...
[16:27:52] <rcyr> What I'm trying to say.... JS is not like PHP, arrays are for numbered indices only
[16:28:10] <rcyr> If you do var x = [];  x['lol'] = 23; You're doing it wrong.
[16:28:19] <Poppabear> sorry, i am so used to PHP ...
[16:28:41] <rcyr> That's okay, I also write PHP these days at work.
[16:29:16] <Poppabear> ok so init a object which would be x = {}, how would you add to the object ?
[16:29:31] <Poppabear> i know this is all 101 but since i am here :P
[16:29:34] <rcyr> À la PHP
[16:29:43] <rcyr> x['key'] = value;
[16:30:17] <Poppabear> you are confusing me now .. lmao
[16:30:41] * Poppabear goes to read :P
[16:30:52] <rcyr> PHP: $lol = []; $lol['foo']  = 10;   JS var lol = []; lol['foo'] = 10;
[16:31:08] <rcyr> Old PHP: $lol = array(); $lol['foo'] = 10;
[16:31:44] <Poppabear> i know php very well, the issue is with jquery :P
[16:32:03] <rcyr> Hehe :)
[16:32:22] <rcyr> Err WTF... I wrote crap.
[16:32:36] <rcyr> 	PHP: $lol = []; $lol['foo']  = 10;   JS var lol = {}; lol['foo'] = 10;    // I mean to write that.
[16:32:52] <rcyr> *meant...
[16:37:43] <hd1> meh
[16:38:35] <Poppabear> rcyr: https://jsfiddle.net/6Lo7przs/ does that look resonable ?
[16:51:07] <rcyr> Poppabear Still alive?
[16:51:22] <Poppabear> yea, but i am debugging a little out of that code
[16:51:23] <Poppabear> :P
[16:52:04] <Poppabear> it works, but the content is not loading until i switch back to the tab ... so i am working that out now
[16:52:14] <rcyr> There's 2 issues with that code 1) You're fighting against async (getContent should be async since it uses async code) 2) You're using when for no reason
[16:52:33] <Poppabear> hmm ok
[16:53:38] <Poppabear> well i have to use when to be sure the templates are loaded correctly in the right order basically
[16:54:41] <Poppabear> well i guess i do not have to now that i moved my template into a solid index template, before it was broken up into header, menu, footer ect ... and a request was being made for it all
[16:54:42] <Poppabear> lol
[16:54:57] <Poppabear> so i can rework that now that i changed it
[16:55:56] <Poppabear> hmmm idk .. that just threw me through a loop
[16:55:58] <Poppabear> lmao
[16:58:16] <Poppabear> yea i am going to rework the code a bit
[17:10:03] <Poppabear> hmmm
[17:33:12] <pauled_> I am getting error when trying to update data in line 49 http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/n5qu67p2/19/
[17:34:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:34:59] <pauled_> NoiseEee: sorry for late response. I updated my fiddle to simulate that case
[17:35:10] <robertmaxrees> do you not see why?
[17:36:09] <pauled_> robertmaxrees: nope, I would not ask otherwise ^^
[17:36:31] <pauled_> JSHint show no errors
[17:37:23] <pauled_> I am trying to simulate new friend added
[17:38:04] <robertmaxrees> preload: [onlineFriends, "foo"] what are you trying to do here?
[17:38:45] <robertmaxrees> put differently - http://fiddle.jshell.net/n5qu67p2/21/
[17:38:56] <pauled_> trying to add foo in prelod
[17:39:11] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you want to do there.
[17:39:17] <robertmaxrees> see why that doesn't work?
[17:40:24] <robertmaxrees> protip: open your console.
[17:41:41] <pauled_> I didn't say it doesn't work, just getting error in console, same as your fiddle
[17:41:45] <pauled_> "Uncaught TypeError: $(...).data(...).split is not a function"
[17:41:50] <robertmaxrees> right. see why?
[17:43:22] <pauled_> I don't see difference, you just removed the '+' but same error?
[17:43:38] <robertmaxrees> i added a console.log() that displays the problem.
[17:43:57] <pauled_> ok let me see again
[17:44:25] <Poppabear> var onlineFriends = $('#friend_box').data('preload')[0].split(','); ??
[17:44:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:45:17] <robertmaxrees> http://fiddle.jshell.net/n5qu67p2/22/
[17:45:34] <robertmaxrees> onlineFriends.push('foo');, then preload: onlineFriends.join(',')
[17:47:14] <arc_> is it possible to show the difference between two versions on jsfiddle
[17:47:20] <pauled_> wow thanks robertmaxrees
[17:47:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:47:28] <robertmaxrees> pauled_ see the issue now?
[17:47:34] <pauled_> there is push and then join
[17:47:45] <robertmaxrees> right - do you see what you were doing wrong?
[17:48:17] <pauled_> I didn't know push and join
[17:48:26] <robertmaxrees> right, that's not what i'm asking.
[17:48:36] <robertmaxrees> do you see why $("#friend_box").data({preload: [onlineFriends, "foo"]}); wasn't what you wanted?
[17:49:11] <pauled_> I followed jquery example
[17:49:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:49:22] <pauled_> let me check the exampe
[17:49:35] <robertmaxrees> preload: [onlineFriends, 'foo'] - you had changed onlineFriends from its original string representation to an array (with the .split() earlier)
[17:49:51] <robertmaxrees> then you tried to set preload to an array with two objects - onlineFriends and 'foo'
[17:50:03] <pauled_> $( "body" ).data( { baz: [ 1, 2, 3 ] } );
[17:50:14] <pauled_> in that page http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:50:23] <robertmaxrees> right, that sets the 'baz' data attribute to an array.
[17:50:48] <robertmaxrees> you wanted to add something to the original string.
[17:51:49] <pauled_> object is not something like that $( "body" ).data( "bar", { myType: "test", count: 40 } );
[17:52:05] <pauled_> I dont see preload as object
[17:52:05] <robertmaxrees> ... right.
[17:52:11] <robertmaxrees> because it's not.
[17:52:13] <pauled_> I see as array
[17:52:23] <robertmaxrees> actually, arrays ARE objects, but that's a whole 'nother topic.
[17:53:00] <robertmaxrees> when you did  preload: [onlineFriends, 'foo'], you were setting preload to an array with two objects.   the first object was the onlineFriends array.
[17:53:07] <robertmaxrees> the second object was the foo string.
[17:54:38] <pauled_> I tought data() it handle with ','
[17:54:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:55:03] <robertmaxrees> you were reading a string with .data()
[17:55:17] <robertmaxrees> you then did .split(',') on that string, which turned it into an array.
[17:56:18] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: you have time to help me better understand this async mess that i keep running into ..... https://jsfiddle.net/6Lo7przs/ .... console.log() shows the content but its not changing the DOM with .html .... I assume its because the .html() is being ran while the ajax call is still processing or is not complete ??
[17:56:19] <pauled_> oh, I guess I see what was the probleme, the '[' ']' ?
[17:56:28] <robertmaxrees> pauled_ again.
[17:56:32] <robertmaxrees> i've explained this multiple times.
[17:56:38] <robertmaxrees> it's a series of things you did incorrectly.
[17:56:58] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear err...
[17:57:02] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use deferreds.
[17:57:17] <Poppabear> sorry, i don't mean to fustrate :P
[17:57:27] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear what are you actually trying to do?
[17:58:18] <Poppabear> is it not clear in that code what my goal is ?
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:58:31] <robertmaxrees> you're combining global variables with deferreds.
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> which never makes sense.
[17:59:16] <jwmann> How come everytime I want to check for a non jquery property I have to do $( 'foobar' )[0].pathname or am I doing this wrong?
[17:59:28] <robertmaxrees> jwmann there's also .get()
[17:59:38] <robertmaxrees> and you can use .prop() usually.
[17:59:42] <robertmaxrees> .prop('pathname')_
[17:59:46] <robertmaxrees> err, no _ after
[18:00:29] <jwmann> Hmm that could work.
[18:00:32] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear i have to leave soon, but https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/
[18:00:52] <robertmaxrees> jwmann that's what .prop() is there for - to read properties.
[18:00:52] <jwmann> Never used .get() before but prop seems very obvious. I don't know why I didn't use it before haha
[18:01:09] <Poppabear> thanks robertmaxrees ...
[18:01:18] <jwmann> I've been using prop this whole time for 'attributes' haha
[18:01:36] <jwmann> Thank you robertmaxrees , again :)
[18:01:39] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[18:01:44] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go home.
[18:01:46] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[18:01:56] <spillere> I have a <select with id='price_option-115' how can I make a selector that will trigger to all price_option-X? thanks
[18:02:34] <rcyr> [id^="price_option-"] ?
[18:03:18] <spillere> rcyr thanks!! just got it jQuery('select[id^="price_option"]').addClass('display_yes');
[18:03:30] <rcyr> Great
[18:14:53] <pauled_> NoiseEee: you there?
[18:15:25] <pauled_> do you see my problem here http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/n5qu67p2/26/
[18:17:15] <pauled_> when I update data-preload manually with the dom inspector by adding another name, the script doesn't handle with it
[18:39:38] <Poppabear> omg this shit is sooo confusing ... why o why
[18:46:07] <Talow> chill it's not that bad.
[18:46:16] <Talow> breath. It's good to have air
[19:22:31] <z1haze> how can i submit a form via ajax from a link? like i have a previous file that ive used but it submits from a form.. this im trying to submit it from a link so i need to know how to designate which form to submit
[19:22:56] <z1haze> here's my example http://hastebin.com/yipuzinixo.coffee
[19:25:21] <DietDrK> I'm typing in  console.log( $('input:radio[name="RankGroup"]:checked').val()); and I'm getting 2 lines in console. The first one is the value, the second one is 'undefined'.  I was under the impression that .val() should always return exactly 1 value.
[19:25:29] <DietDrK> Also, I'm typing the console.log part directly into the console.
[19:26:00] <DietDrK> Oh. If I type "$('input:radio[name="RankGroup"]:checked').val();" I get only the value I requested.
[19:28:23] <shoky> DietDrK: the 2nd value printed is the return value from console.log()
[19:30:41] <z1haze> please?
[19:32:48] <Poppabear> shoky ... does this code look any better then the previous ? it works but i want to make sure that its atleast semi-sane :P https://jsfiddle.net/gh9prwxz/
[19:33:34] <shoky> Poppabear: what previous? i wasn't here for a while..
[19:34:05] <Poppabear> oh, well nevermind about previous, but can you give me any feedback on it as it sits ?
[19:37:58] <shoky> Poppabear: seems ok more or less
[19:38:23] <Poppabear> any suggestions that stand out like a sore thumb ?
[19:38:30] <shoky> that deferred in prepareInterface isn't doing anything, don't need it
[19:38:59] <Poppabear> even tho it has to return a promise ?
[19:39:11] <shoky> why does it have to return a promise
[19:40:14] <shoky> anyways i dont really know what you're actually trying to do, so hard to give any suggestions
[19:40:21] <Poppabear> because the tbContent selector will not be available until after the index content has finished, and i am calling getContent right after prepareInterface ?
[19:40:40] <DietDrK> shoky: I thought console.log() was VOID?
[19:41:11] <shoky> Poppabear: the index content has already finished by the time prepateInterface is called
[19:41:29] <shoky> DietDrK: it returns undefined
[19:41:41] <DietDrK> that's what VOID means in JS?
[19:41:49] <Poppabear> oh i see .. hmmm
[19:42:09] <Poppabear> ok well i will try without the deferred
[19:42:13] <shoky> DietDrK: it's an operator that returns undefined, or something stupid like that, you can ignore it
[19:44:17] <Poppabear> shoky: thanks seems to work fine without it ... still trying to learn how this async in jquery works :P
[19:45:15] <DietDrK> async in JS is just AJAX, no?
[19:46:03] <shoky> ajax, timeouts, etc
[19:46:32] <Poppabear> right but async in jquery by definition is different then the familiar async
[19:46:43] <shoky> not really
[19:48:15] <Poppabear> async means that the operation is running while not disturbing the rest of the operations, the operations run side by side, its doesn't wait for the ajax call to finish before process the rest of the code. unless i am mis understanding something
[19:48:18] <shoky> unless you mean that jquery's promises are different from the familiar promises
[19:48:57] <shoky> Poppabear more or less... that's true in jquery and outside jquery
[19:51:02] <Poppabear> right but in jquery the rest of the operations don't care about the async operation, no ?
[19:51:18] <shoky> same outside jquery
[19:52:00] <DietDrK> So it can get the AJAX response on its own time?
[19:52:06] <Poppabear> i must be confused or not explaining correctly why i think its different
[19:52:24] <shoky> the browser does the ajax "on its own time" in the background, whether you're using jquery or not
[19:52:45] <DietDrK> Doesn't all JS stop while waiting for response?
[19:52:56] <Poppabear> no
[19:52:57] <shoky> no, the A in ajax is async
[19:53:10] <DietDrK> So what can be more async than AJAX?
[19:53:34] <shoky> stuff are either async, or not ;p
[19:54:52] <Poppabear> if you are familier with windows developement, its like multithreading. :P
[19:55:09] <DietDrK> oh. setting async: false makes everything else sto pfiring
[19:55:12] <shoky> haha fortunately it's nothing like multithreading ;D
[19:55:36] <shoky> setting async: false  should be forgotten
[19:55:53] <DietDrK> I know async in the low-level sense of the term
[19:55:57] <Poppabear> kinda, allowing operations work indepently :P
[19:56:45] <shoky> yes threads allow that too. that's where the similarity ends ;p
[19:56:52] <Poppabear> lmao
[19:57:32] <DietDrK> I had difficulty understanding how up/down-ticks could be related to JQuery
[19:58:22] <Poppabear> its sooo bed time for me ... nite all
[20:09:59] <gambl0re> if you can do something in css instead of jquery, is it better to just do it the css way?
[20:10:40] <gambl0re> for example a sliding dropdown menu..
[20:30:55] <rubyronin> I'maaxing json which contains html I want to format in a particular matter
[20:31:06] <rubyronin> i have json rather. Whats the best way to go about doing that?
[20:32:04] <DietDrK> This is my ajax with a JSON object: http://pastebin.com/Qah66TVY
[20:33:00] <DietDrK> Are you asking how to perform string manipulations in JS?
[20:33:17] <rubyronin> I don't know
[20:33:28] <DietDrK> or you want to load it into DOM then change it with stuff like $('selector').attr("id","100"); ?
[20:33:34] <rubyronin> My json object contains an iframe
[20:33:56] <rubyronin> I want to display that in a jquery mobile page
[20:34:35] <DietDrK> Then I'd do something like this:                   $('#iFrameDiv').append(json_x['iFrameStuff']);
[20:34:37] <DietDrK> I'd try that
[20:35:04] <DietDrK> but I don't really know about append/innerHTML or even JSONObject.html(); that well
[20:35:10] <rubyronin> thanks
[22:30:26] <thealphanerd> anyone wanna go to jQuerySF?
[22:30:29] <thealphanerd> if you pm me I’ll hook you up with a special IRC discount :D woop woop
[22:41:48] <Uhkis> jquery what?
[22:53:15] <DietDrK> It's an event, but not much information on it online.
[22:53:20] <DietDrK> http://jquerysf.com/
[22:53:30] <DietDrK> They have a list of speakers, but not topics or anything...
[22:53:58] <DietDrK> Also, it looks like it was just created this year...
[23:01:19] <Uhkis> maybe some year.. :)
[23:26:34] <larsemil> how do i change hover color with jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/kuLv4fno/
[23:26:37] <larsemil> that does not work.
[23:28:39] <DietDrK> You didn't load JQuery
[23:28:52] <Uhkis> larsemil: http://jsfiddle.net/kuLv4fno/1/
[23:29:07] <DietDrK> there's an error in the console.
[23:29:22] <larsemil> Uhkis: yes. i did get that to work
[23:29:31] <DietDrK> also, why'd you add :something to $(this)?
[23:29:32] <larsemil> i was wondering how to set css for a:hover
[23:29:49] <DietDrK> http://jsfiddle.net/kuLv4fno/2/
[23:30:01] <ozette> use .on("hover").css(...)
[23:30:17] <larsemil> no. that sets the css for the object even when its not hovered
[23:30:29] <larsemil> imagine i have following css: a:hover{color: #333}
[23:30:32] <DietDrK> it is only triggered when #logo is hovered over.
[23:30:34] <larsemil> thats the attribute i want to change
[23:30:41] <ozette> https://jsfiddle.net/kuLv4fno/
[23:31:05] <ozette> DietDrK's example works as well
[23:31:06] <larsemil> ozette: does not work.
[23:31:30] <DietDrK> I really don't know where you get off adding ':hover' to $(this) like $(this+':hover')
[23:31:39] <larsemil> no, thats not working
[23:31:45] <DietDrK> I've only been doing jquery for like 4 days, but I don't think that would ever work.
[23:31:51] <larsemil> i am wondering if there is a way to access the :hover attributes from jquery
[23:33:09] <DietDrK> Why do you want to do it from JQuery?
[23:33:17] <Uhkis> well that wasn't your original question
[23:33:39] <ozette> larsemil: oops, https://jsfiddle.net/kuLv4fno/3/
[23:33:41] <DietDrK> http://jsfiddle.net/kuLv4fno/4/
[23:33:42] <larsemil> Uhkis: kind of. changing color and changing hover color are two different things
[23:34:11] <DietDrK> now you have two triggers on the same thing?
[23:34:21] <larsemil> you dont understand what i mean
[23:34:28] <DietDrK> I can see how that's my fault.
[23:34:35] <larsemil> DietDrK: your example. how do i change that css from jquery
[23:34:42] <larsemil> that is what i need
[23:35:01] <DietDrK> I'm brand new to JS/JQ and haven't touched CSS.
[23:35:04] <ozette> ah
[23:35:08] <ozette> i see..
[23:35:58] <ozette> but honestly
[23:36:21] <ozette> if that should happen on hover or mouseover, what's the difference?
[23:36:32] <larsemil> none
[23:36:36] <larsemil> still not my question
[23:36:38] <DietDrK> He's trying to add an extra layer of complexity.
[23:36:48] <DietDrK> So people don't steal his styling.
[23:36:56] <larsemil> no. thats not it.
[23:37:08] <larsemil> i want to set a random hover color every time i hover. not the original color. only hover color
[23:37:20] <ozette> that's what's happening
[23:37:22] <larsemil> no
[23:37:29] <larsemil> you set the elements color upon hover.
[23:37:30] <DietDrK> he shouldn't be using mouseenter then
[23:37:44] <larsemil> you know about the :hover selector in css?
[23:37:59] <ozette> there is no hover color
[23:38:03] <larsemil> yes there is
[23:38:13] <ozette> then what is it
[23:38:18] <larsemil> hang on
[23:38:48] <DietDrK> hold original color in memory. on mouseleave return to original color.
[23:38:58] <larsemil> DietDrK: yes. that is one way.
[23:39:03] <larsemil> DietDrK: and that works fine
[23:39:10] <larsemil> http://jsfiddle.net/kuLv4fno/5/
[23:39:25] <larsemil> in that example. how do i access the css from the hover attribute?
[23:39:37] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/kuLv4fno/6/
[23:39:59] <ozette> $("#logo").css("hover") ?
[23:40:01] <DietDrK> with .css()
[23:40:23] <larsemil> DietDrK: how? its not possible
[23:40:42] <DietDrK> I won't bother if it's not possible, then!
[23:40:58] <DietDrK> That'd be silly
[23:41:10] <larsemil> it seems inpossible
[23:41:16] <larsemil> but obviously there has to be a way
[23:43:07] <Uhkis> larsemil: there is, but it's not pretty
[23:43:17] <larsemil> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4434
[23:43:25] <larsemil> found that bug, seems to have been for a while
[23:43:51] <Uhkis> larsemil: http://stackoverflow.com/a/13651994/1381706
[23:44:31] <DietDrK> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4719421/get-the-css-value-from-hover-with-css-jquery
[23:44:33] <larsemil> Uhkis: THANKS! not pretty, i agree. :)
[23:46:18] <ozette> so, why are you doing this?
[23:46:41] <larsemil> actually i tried something, and it did not work. so i started experimenting just to know
[23:48:21] <larsemil> thanks for the discussion though. :)
