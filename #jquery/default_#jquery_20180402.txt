[07:54:33] <HackeMate> hello
[07:55:00] <HackeMate> i have a form, then i add new input text to the form using jquery, but when i submit the form the new elements are missing
[07:55:11] <HackeMate> how can i reload DOM document before submiting?
[11:13:00] <spaces> is there any basic en-US to find like these ? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/ui/i18n
[13:42:07] <codecutter> Not sure how to format this json date object (java localdatetime) to "02-04-2018 18:38:7 PM GMT+1" https://pastebin.com/NU5i5XFM
[13:43:57] <robertmaxrees> codecutter you've got everything you need but the time zone info.
[13:44:32] <codecutter> i aready know the time zone (its fixed)
[13:44:37] <codecutter> GMT+1
[13:44:49] <robertmaxrees> codecutter okay... so it's just a bunch of concatenation then.
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> also: 18:38:7 PM is redundant
[13:45:36] <robertmaxrees> and odd - why are you 0-padding in some cases but not others?
[13:45:41] <codecutter> yeah, just realised
[13:45:44] <codecutter> :)
[13:57:54] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: what do you mean/
[13:57:58] <codecutter> ?
[13:58:35] <codecutter> here's my formatter https://pastebin.com/wBWs4Lig
[14:00:11] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:02:55] <codecutter> 18:45:35]  <robertmaxrees>	and odd - why are you 0-padding in some cases but not others?
[14:03:44] <robertmaxrees> 02-04-2018 18:38:7 PM GMT+1 - no 0 padding on seconds.
[14:05:50] <codecutter> i know
[14:05:55] <codecutter> strange
[14:06:45] <codecutter> anyway, line 11 takes care of that
[14:07:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:07:12] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:07:55] <codecutter> no, go on...
[14:08:04] <codecutter> did you mean something else?
[14:08:31] <codecutter> nvm, it appears to work :)
[14:09:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:09:42] <robertmaxrees> just confusedf.
[14:09:56] <robertmaxrees> you asked for help getting data into a format but that wasn't really the format you wanted in the first place.
[14:09:59] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[14:11:39] <dimi1947> I cannot understand why this code here is not working https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/cbm82n6L/2/
[14:13:13] <dimi1947> I am just trying to grab the data-service value
[14:13:56] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 because that selector isn't matching anything.
[14:14:25] <robertmaxrees> $('form[0][service]') don't select on the name attribute.
[14:15:36] <dimi1947> yes...I understand
[14:15:53] <dimi1947> I am trying to figure out how to alter the syntax
[14:19:14] <dimi1947> I am stuck...I cannot think clearly
[14:21:08] <robertmaxrees> so
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> step back.
[14:21:22] <robertmaxrees> what kinds of things do you normally use to select?
[14:30:20] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: its the same format, well it should be
[14:30:27] <codecutter> show me where
[14:30:38] <codecutter> maybe i missed something
[14:31:39] <codecutter> oh, you mean the missing '0' before the '7'?
[14:32:35] <codecutter> if thats the case, all single digital must have leading zero (i overlooked that)
[14:38:01] <robertmaxrees> and the PM thing.  and the GMT + 1 or /we
[14:38:02] <robertmaxrees> *w/e
[14:38:29] <robertmaxrees> not a big deal, just got a chuckle outta me :)
[15:55:23] <vacho> some help would be appreciated.. https://paste.ofcode.org/eK2pEQE7MpzxcrdiS6PA2D
[15:55:31] <vacho> I am trying to add the class "error" to line 5
[16:18:51] <Woet> vacho: do you have an actual question or did you just want to let us know?
[16:19:21] <vacho> Woet: i figured it out..thanks
[16:19:30] <Woet> that was quick
[16:20:12] <vacho> Woet: I am quick even outside the bed
[16:20:16] <Woet> nice
[16:22:09] <LooenyToones> anyone wanna take a look at something...trying to replace or add/remove 1st element of an array everything i've tried seems to fail.... https://jsfiddle.net/9umh1fwr/734/
[16:23:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:23:45] <LooenyToones> i create an array and use .push() to add to it
[16:23:51] <LooenyToones> but I can't seem to remove from i t
[16:24:04] <robertmaxrees> what will these arrays contain?  jquery objects?
[16:24:05] <LooenyToones> its based on dependencies
[16:24:17] <robertmaxrees> also: why do you need these arrays at all?
[16:24:23] <robertmaxrees> trying to understand the problem :)
[16:24:43] <LooenyToones> the array represents a breadcrumb history, live, add / delete as clicks occur
[16:25:27] <LooenyToones> ignore all the console.log's
[16:25:28] <LooenyToones> LOLOL
[16:25:48] <robertmaxrees> okay... so if it's a history, why do you need to remove things?
[16:26:52] <LooenyToones> because the history path changes
[16:27:06] <robertmaxrees> already lost heh.
[16:27:09] <LooenyToones> Home / about / us / is L0, L1 and L2
[16:27:25] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to record history, or are you trying to get the current "path" to the thing that was clicked?
[16:27:30] <LooenyToones> Home / contact / is L0, and still L1
[16:27:47] <LooenyToones> so replace the item corresponding to L1
[16:27:55] <robertmaxrees> ^ see my last question.
[16:30:44] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:32:50] <LooenyToones> both
[16:33:06] <LooenyToones> it has to do with menu levels
[16:33:11] <robertmaxrees> 'cause it's pretty trivial to get the path to the current element.
[16:33:14] <robertmaxrees> without needing to store state
[16:33:57] <LooenyToones> sigh
[16:34:05] <vacho> hey guys I am using this plugin and I am hoping to make it validate as the user it typing in the input field, https://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/ any great would be apprecaited
[16:34:12] <LooenyToones> its up levels and sub levels.
[16:35:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost then, I guess.
[16:35:38] <LooenyToones> A, B, C, root = A, options B1, B2, B3, if you have A, click on B1, you get A / B1, but if you click on B3, change A/B3, if you further click C2 (of C1, C2, C3), you get A/B3/C2 if you then click again, you get D4 of (D1, D2, D3, D4), hence your array should look like A/B3/C2/D4
[16:36:33] <LooenyToones> but the array original looked like A/B1
[16:36:45] <LooenyToones> you just kept adding / deleting from it to maintain the route
[16:36:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm having a hard time understanding how that structure relates back to your fiddle >.>
[16:37:42] <robertmaxrees> if you want the “path” to the current clicked menu item (which it looks like you want), that’s easy.  i don’t see why you need to store history for any of this.  that’s where I’m lost.
[16:38:08] <LooenyToones> do you see the the menu in the fiddle
[16:38:26] <robertmaxrees> i do.
[16:38:38] <LooenyToones> ok...consider
[16:38:48] <LooenyToones> I'm sitting @ home (or A)
[16:39:16] <LooenyToones> I click on option B which is . level 1 option or I click on C which is also level 1 option or D also Level 1
[16:40:35] <robertmaxrees> ‘kay
[16:40:57] <LooenyToones> so  A -> B or A ->C or A ->D but the array is build on 1 of those 3 the arr = [A, nextItem changes, nextItem changes] because, if I clicked on B, and then I click on D, the arr = [A, B], but once I click on D, the arr = [A,D]
[16:41:22] <robertmaxrees> right, so when you click on “d”, you want the array to be [A, D]?
[16:41:31] <LooenyToones> yeah, but I can't remove the B
[16:41:36] <LooenyToones> its pissing me off LOLOL
[16:41:48] <robertmaxrees> right, literally what I’m saying - you don’t need to maintain state at all for that.
[16:42:10] <LooenyToones> um
[16:42:14] <LooenyToones> can i call you robert?
[16:42:19] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[16:42:26] <LooenyToones> uh robert, I don't know what a state "is"?
[16:42:32] <robertmaxrees> the array.
[16:42:34] <LooenyToones> i'm just starting out in JS / jQuery
[16:43:00] <LooenyToones> it was the only way I could think of to keep all the items in 1 list, just add and delete from list as needed
[16:43:01] <robertmaxrees> you’re trying to record actions and then hold that information - there’s literally no reason to do that when what you’re trying to do is get the “path” of clicked navitems
[16:44:31] <robertmaxrees> also: your html is invalid.
[16:44:49] <LooenyToones> how so ?
[16:44:53] <robertmaxrees> ULs can only have LIs as direct children.
[16:45:16] <robertmaxrees> but you’re doing <ul><ul> </ul></ul> for your child menus.
[16:47:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c59L8bo1/8/ I fixed your “page B” in this example.
[16:52:01] <LooenyToones> thanks, gonna have to watch my tags
[16:52:16] <robertmaxrees> you’ll want to fix that before trying to move forward.
[16:52:22] <LooenyToones> already did
[16:52:26] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[16:52:41] <LooenyToones> if someone see's 1, i go hunt fo more
[16:52:45] <LooenyToones> becuz probably
[16:52:46] <LooenyToones> LOLOL
[17:57:11] <Nirvash> Any thoughts on why .change() isn't noticing the text in a textarea change?
[20:23:29] <LooenyToones> no idea...haven't seen code
[20:54:56] <jak2000> hi all
[20:55:23] <jak2000> any plugin for wait an ajax request (the reponse) somethin like 1% 4% 23% 45% 60% 78% 90% 100% ?
