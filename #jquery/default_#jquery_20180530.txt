[00:16:25] <n00b654> hey - I'm having some issues. can anybody help?
[00:19:34] <Robdgreat> n00b654: not if you don't ask your question
[00:20:20] <Robdgreat> potentially not even then, but at least we'll have a chance to know if we can help or not
[00:20:28] <n00b654> I'm trying to select this element: <h1 name="a" id="b">Welcome To Website</h1> using this code: $('body',  window.parent.parent.document).find("*:contains('Welcome To Website')").attr('id') but it gives 'undefined'
[00:20:37] <Robdgreat> as it stands, only the mindreaders among us have a chance of that
[00:20:50] <n00b654> however, this code works properly: $('body',  window.parent.parent.document).find("h1").attr('id')
[00:21:13] <n00b654> I need to search the document for a string and return the id containing the string
[00:21:46] <Robdgreat> find the id of the element containing the string?
[00:22:31] <n00b654> yeah, for example, search plain text for "Welcome To Website" , if it's found return #b
[00:25:28] <Robdgreat> make a jsfiddle
[00:25:37] <Robdgreat> it works for me in some random site
[00:25:47] <Robdgreat> (using a different string, one that appears in the text)
[01:15:58] <Cork> n00b654: is the parent.parent document on the same domain?
[01:16:09] <n00b654> yes
[01:16:18] <n00b654> it's just not finding the text
[01:16:25] <Cork> you have a link?
[01:16:44] <n00b654> no link, it's on my local machine
[01:16:47] <Cork> (you can't really reproduce this in jsfiddle or any of the other demo sites)
[01:18:22] <n00b654> I keeping getting length: 0 w/ the :contains
[01:19:54] <Cork> ah sorry i missed that .find works
[01:20:25] <n00b654> yes, it does
[01:20:50] <n00b654> am I using contains properly?
[01:20:54] <Cork> n00b654: what happens if you search for .find(':contains("Welcome")') ?
[01:21:00] <Cork> you don't need *
[01:21:06] <Cork> but other then that, yes
[01:22:06] <n00b654> $('body',  window.parent.parent.document).find(':contains("Welcome")').attr('id') undefined
[01:22:07] <Cork> though that said, if you can i would strongly recommend to not use :contains if you can
[01:22:18] <Cork> that is weird...
[01:22:19] <n00b654> oh
[01:22:44] <n00b654> well, I need to search the html for a string and return the id of the element
[01:23:04] <Cork> :contains serializes the elements to html and then string searches that for match, so it is very slow
[01:23:27] <Cork> n00b654: and you can't do something like $('h1').first() to get it?
[01:23:50] <n00b654> the string isn't always in an h1 tag
[01:23:58] <n00b654> it can be in other tags also
[01:24:45] <Cork> ya, well it sill only work for one locale, and that is one of the biggest problems i have with the solution
[01:25:39] <n00b654> I see
[01:26:25] <Cork> do depend on the translation of the page, and the slow structurs of the selector is the two biggest problems i have with the selector
[01:26:32] <Cork> do == to
[01:28:21] <n00b654> right.
[01:29:21] <n00b654> I'm not sure why it doesn't work though
[01:29:38] <Cork> ya, can't really tell you
[01:30:08] <n00b654> is it a bug?
[01:30:11] <Cork> no
[01:30:24] <Cork> but see if you can reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[01:30:31] <Cork> (not cross document though)
[01:31:05] <n00b654> I tried, it seemed to work within the same document
[01:31:35] <Cork> are both pages using the same encoding?
[01:31:54] <n00b654> meaning?
[01:32:38] <Cork> text encoding of the html content
[01:34:38] <n00b654> they are all using utf-8
[01:34:59] <Cork> ya, can't guess without actually inspecting the result
[01:35:33] <n00b654> could I load the html() into a string and get the id that way?
[01:35:48] <Cork> possibly
[01:35:59] <Cork> you would have to use regex though
[01:36:33] <n00b654> I can't just search the string for text?
[01:36:57] <Cork> sure. but that won't really help you find the id too much
[01:37:04] <Cork> from html you don't have elements
[01:37:12] <n00b654> ah
[01:37:16] <Cork> just a blob of characters
[01:37:34] <n00b654> any idea what the regex would be?
[01:38:06] <n00b654> select all instances of "text" and return the ids for each
[01:41:30] <n00b654> I've got this working: 					var body = $("body", window.parent.parent.document); 					var text = body.html();
[01:47:42] <Cork> ya, just $(window.parent.parent.document).html() should work too
[01:49:33] <n00b654> ok
[01:49:43] <n00b654> you know what the regex would look like?
[01:50:37] <Cork> maybe /id.*>Welcome To Website/
[01:51:15] <Cork> but that said, i would really recommend looking at element selectors instead of this solution
[01:51:32] <Cork> or to have the caller give you the content instead
[01:51:47] <n00b654> meaning the :contains selector?
[01:51:51] <Cork> no
[01:52:03] <Cork> cause that is basically what you're currently doing
[01:52:22] <Cork> i mean to stop selecting on content and start selecting with real selectors
[01:52:41] <Cork> for example ask the embeder to set a class on the target element
[01:52:43] <Cork> or what ever
[01:53:02] <Cork> there are a lot of simple solutions to this that isn't this hacky
[01:54:41] <n00b654> ok, I'll look into that.
[01:54:47] <n00b654> thanks
[01:54:50] <Cork> np
[02:20:16] <Jonno_FTW> how can I disable a button until all inputs in a form are entered?
[02:27:58] <Cork> Jonno_FTW: set it disabled and remove disabled (.prop('disabled', false)) when the input gets the input event for example
[05:00:40] <ryan_ford> does disabled=false work or do you need to remove the property?
[05:01:07] <Cork> i gave you exactly what to use
[05:01:12] <ryan_ford> i thought disabled/hidden were either on or off
[05:08:44] <FilipNortic> ryan_ford: might wanna read some documentation and convince yourself...
[05:09:30] <ryan_ford> I've read plenty.. that was kind of condescending
[05:10:53] <ryan_ford> html anyway, i guess it could be jQuery magic you're referring to
[05:12:04] <Cork> magic?
[05:12:24] <FilipNortic> disabled work just with the empty attribute i think
[05:12:30] <Cork> no
[05:12:43] <Cork> and you shouldn't control dom state with html attributes
[05:12:54] <ryan_ford> https://jsfiddle.net/ryanford/of8s2LLu/
[05:13:09] <Cork> something i was trying to hint on if ppl cared to look up the documentation for the function i pointed at...
[05:13:14] <ryan_ford> magic polymorphism i suppose
[05:13:35] <Cork> hidden isn't even valid attribute
[05:13:37] <FilipNortic> we were talking html now...
[05:14:13] <FilipNortic> and in html disable is represented with disabled="" I think?
[05:14:22] <ryan_ford> https://devdocs.io/html/global_attributes/hidden
[05:14:36] <Cork> disabled, disabled="" disabled="disabled" disabled="fish"
[05:14:43] <Cork> all sets the form element as disabled
[05:14:52] <Cork> (or what ever value you give it)
[05:15:11] <ryan_ford> that's what I meant, so if you set disabled="false" i was under the impression it would still be disabled
[05:15:16] <ryan_ford> that's what I was originally asking
[05:15:27] <Cork> ryan_ford: well that doesn't make it a valid attribute
[05:15:34] <Cork> just an abused attribute by angular
[05:16:11] <Cork> and if angular parses html attributes in a none standard way ask in an angular related channel
[05:16:15] <ryan_ford> what? it's in the standard
[05:16:18] <Cork> no
[05:16:48] <ryan_ford> https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/editing.html#the-hidden-attribute
[05:17:42] <ryan_ford> anyway, I'll just see what jQ is doing with it. probably just removes those on/off attributes. I was just curious. carry on
[05:20:05] <Cork> ryan_ford: it isn't attributes when it is in the dom, it is properties so just set the property
[05:20:42] <Cork> attribute doesn't have on/off it is just an attribute with a string value, never anything else
[05:20:54] <Cork> it is in the dom it becomes states like toggles
[05:22:02] <FilipNortic> and even the posted docs uses it  like: document.getElementById('login').hidden = true;  document.getElementById('game').hidden = false;
[05:22:18] <ryan_ford> yeah i saw that lol
[05:22:50] <FilipNortic> which is basicly what the jQuery prop() function does
[05:24:47] <Cork> it is actually exactly what jquery does
[05:24:55] <Cork> except it is ['hidden']
[05:25:22] <ryan_ford> i think Cork had the tldr, it's an attribute in the html, but a dom property. so you can set it with js but not in html
[05:25:44] <Cork> you can set it in html too if it is a dom property
[05:25:54] <Cork> but you can't set it in an off state
[05:25:59] <Cork> (you don't set it at all then)
[05:26:22] <ryan_ford> well that's what I was getting at
[05:27:30] <ryan_ford> anyway, that answers the original question I had, thanks
[05:59:44] <nQk> Hi, how can I force re-validation of a form with jquery validate?
[06:00:59] <nQk> I have different sections/pages of a form. Some fields are dependant on others. When the user goes back one section/page and resets a value such that formerly hidden inputs appear, I want the form to be invalid because the new field are empty.
[06:07:02] <FilipNortic> nQk: $("#myform input").change(function(){$("#myform").validate()}); something like that?
[06:08:44] <nQk> FilipNortic: $("form").valid() stays true if once true
[06:09:50] <nQk> even after .validate()
[06:10:11] <AdamPDotty> hard reset would be Validator.destroy(); Validator = form.validate();
[06:12:24] <AdamPDotty> but then again, I would expect each change in an element o reset valid()
[06:12:29] <AdamPDotty> Do you have a fiddle?
[06:12:54] <nQk> VM729:1 Uncaught TypeError: $.validator.destroy is not a function
[06:13:20] <nQk> code is too complex for a fiddle I think ^^
[06:14:08] <nQk> what could the validator object be called?
[06:14:52] <AdamPDotty> The demo works with back: https://jqueryvalidation.org/files/demo/multipart/
[06:15:29] <AdamPDotty> You get the Validator returned from form.validate();
[06:18:18] <FilipNortic> nQk: and I still think reset() should work
[06:18:38] <FilipNortic> lol but that not what i wrote...
[06:18:55] <nQk> $('form').validate().reset() doesnt work
[06:19:09] <nQk> $('form').validate().destroy() is not a function
[06:20:19] <FilipNortic> $("form").validator() ?
[06:22:07] <nQk> I'm setting the "disabled" attribute of certain inputs back to false. Somehow the validator does not recognize these newly enabled inputs
[06:22:25] <FilipNortic> which version are you using?
[06:22:29] <nQk> VM859:1 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).validator is not a function
[06:23:02] <nQk> FilipNortic: I must say I dont know, it's copied code, ha. How do I find out?
[06:25:07] <FilipNortic> I don't know the docs on validate are not that good...
[06:25:32] <AdamPDotty> So for all we know it might be a diy validator.
[06:26:42] <nQk> I acutally think it's not jquery validate
[06:26:45] <nQk> thanks anyway ^^
[07:09:16] <irisarce> https://pastebin.com/LkgDUZeq - how can i clone this data with click events... ive tried detach and clone(true, true)... although when item is clicked does not work
[07:13:27] <irisarce> :)
[07:16:41] <Cork> irisarce: make a jsfiddle
[07:22:58] <pj> Hi, if I'm iterating over an object with $.each() will it cause problems if I modify the object from inside the callback function?  Eg: $.each(myObj, function(k,v){if (k=="foo"){myObj[k] = v+"bar"}})
[07:26:31] <FilipNortic> pj: it shouldn't matter, any special reason you think it would ?
[07:26:37] <irisarce> my internet cut out, real sorry everyone... currently hotspotting off my phone
[07:27:36] <pj> FilipNortic: well probably not for modifying the value, but I was also wondering about adding and removing keys, how that would affect looping through the object.
[07:28:39] <pj> my main thinking is along the lines of if the object changes mid-loop how will it affect the loop?
[07:29:26] <irisarce> not sure if anyone replied to me, my internet keeps dropping out
[07:30:08] <FilipNortic> js is singlethreaded for the most part so there is no issues on that end but you might not get the resluts you are expecting...
[07:30:34] <FilipNortic> irisarce: no, make a fiddle is the only response you got so far
[07:31:05] <irisarce> https://jsfiddle.net/q4j2L7mm/
[07:31:23] <irisarce> FilipNortic: thanks for the help :)
[07:31:33] <FilipNortic> there is still no js there...
[07:37:06] <irisarce> https://jsfiddle.net/q4j2L7mm/1/
[07:37:14] <irisarce> FilipNortic: updated
[07:37:23] <irisarce> any help much appreciated
[07:38:43] <AdamPDotty> What a mess! Anyways what was the question?
[07:40:31] <irisarce> AdamPDotty: haha Im trying to make my front end better, I would like to clone the div-spend_money_form into the form so that when a dropdown is clicked the user can make a choice
[07:42:08] <irisarce> full html is https://pastebin.com/xZ7r1R8S if that helps anyone
[07:42:18] <irisarce> it gets messy while debugging :)
[07:43:26] <irisarce> oh that does not render nice... this is a django project
[07:43:33] <Cork> pj: changing future key names and things like that can make things weird
[07:43:52] <FilipNortic> never tried to add click elements on a select... feel strange
[07:43:59] <Cork> pj: but in its core it is just a for(o in object) {} so it has the same limitations
[07:44:41] <Cork> irisarce: my response was <Cork> irisarce: make a jsfiddle
[07:44:53] <Cork> not fun debugging a pastebin
[07:45:12] <FilipNortic> he made a fiddle but the js is a bit lacking
[07:45:44] <Cork> ya, doesn't really explain what the problem is
[07:47:18] <irisarce> the select works as a dropdown when i normally render it. It is how Django outputs ForeignKey as Choice
[07:47:57] <Cork> irisarce: what is the real question?
[07:48:36] <Cork> you just hint that you've tried something with clone and detach, not what you're actually trying to solve
[07:49:36] <irisarce> when i clone the div.spend_money_form to a transaction(this case form.spend_money_form-21),the data is there but when i click on the checkbox it does not drop or load data(but all data is there)
[07:50:51] <AdamPDotty>  /locate checkbox …
[07:51:00] <Cork> irisarce: most likely cause the script bound in the event handlers are defined to work with the original elements
[07:51:17] <irisarce> Cork: $("#spend_money_form").clone(true, true).appendTo("#spend_money_form-21");
[07:51:50] <AdamPDotty> That would surely lead to double id.
[07:52:03] <irisarce> Cork: So is it possible to use the cloned data and still allow the user to click as if it were normal?
[07:52:16] <Cork> irisarce: that just clones the dom elements and the event bindings, it doens't rewrite the event handlers bound, IF they depend on that
[07:52:58] <Cork> some bind event handlers with references to the outer scope around it, and then you can't clone then dom elements
[07:53:05] <Cork> as it will always break there expectation
[07:53:39] <Cork> but ya, as AdamPDotty said another option is that you get duplicate ids and that is why the second form doesn't fire anything
[07:54:22] <Cork> but i suspect more the hard bound dom refernces
[07:55:12] <Cork> ex selector = $('<div class="selector">'); selector.on(function() { selector.find() });
[07:55:40] <Cork> ^ that would break royally if you cloned the selector div
[07:56:35] <irisarce> Cork: thanks for the reply
[07:56:41] <irisarce> AdamPDotty: thanks as well!
[07:58:04] <Cork> basically for code to support cloning it has to be written explicitly for it, cause you can never store dom references outside even handlers, cause those will break things
[07:58:16] <Cork> even==event
[08:02:28] <irisarce> Cork: I've saved everything you've said and I will study it, thanks for the help!!
[08:03:29] <Cork> irisarce: also an alternative is to make the even handlers delegated, then you would not have to clone the event handlers at all :)
[08:03:35] <Cork> just saying ;)
[08:04:21] <AdamPDotty> Still it would be advisable to build the DOM for that purpose.
[08:04:29] <Cork> yup
[08:04:51] <Cork> and... why do i keep losing the t in event...
[08:05:18] <irisarce> Cork: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ is this what you mean by even handlers delegated?
[08:05:41] <Cork> irisarce: yes, and good that you picked that source!
[08:09:03] <irisarce> Cork: thanks heaps, going to jump off my choopy internet connection and read all about it and try to fix
[08:09:17] <irisarce> Cork: have a great day!
[08:09:22] <Cork> same
[09:35:30] <xhoy> Anybody any experience with access key's on mobile browsers? (how do i do alt+shift+<accesskey> in  amobile browser without a keyboard?)
[09:36:54] <Cork> xhoy: you don't, as far as i know
[09:37:21] <Cork> the browser/site has to either provide an alternative way to input it, or you have to install something like the hacker keyboard
[09:37:40] <xhoy> ok
[09:38:07] <xhoy> but you are not aware of any alternative way how this is handeld on mobile browsers (some gesture or something?)
[09:39:14] <Cork> nope
[09:39:32] <Cork> as far as i know alt is not something that mobile devices has as a concept
[09:45:54] <brk_> Hi, is there any pre-built bundle with jquery AND jquery UI?
[09:46:29] <Cork> brk_: you mean a zip file?
[09:46:48] <Cork> jquery ui requires css to work so it can't be in one usable file
[09:47:27] <brk_> Cork, no I mean when I go visit a website in the network request it is downloading jquery and jquery UI, wouldn't it be an optimization to combine those two?
[09:47:48] <Cork> no
[09:48:16] <Cork> for http you can just concat them after each other and send them as on .js + the .css file
[09:48:29] <Cork> and in http2 it is better to just serve them straight off
[09:51:00] <gm____> hi i have a problem to change the combox in SharePoint. The value none must be : Select value: instead of (None)
[09:51:18] <brk_> Cork, sorry I meant the jquery ui js file not the css file.
[09:51:37] <Cork> brk_: ya, but the same answer applies
[09:52:13] <Cork> gm____: look at the generated <select> element
[09:52:58] <Cork> gm____: if you want to change the content of the first <option> element you can either change this after the fact with jquery, but i would recommend looking for a server side solution
[09:55:19] <gm____> i have used the following : http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[09:56:00] <gm____> it works fine instead that I cannot change (none)
[09:56:04] <Cork> uh, what does that have to... oh you mean a scripted autocomplete with a dropdown button
[09:56:12] <gm____> yes
[09:56:21] <Cork> gm____: look at the data you give as source to the autocompete
[09:59:23] <gm____> This is the url i have found : http://wp.ahcheng.com/2015/12/06/enable-search-feature-for-sharepoint-lookup-table-single-value-only/
[10:00:46] <Cork> gm____: from skimming the page it looks like the (none) comes from the server
[10:00:52] <Cork> cause it doesn't exist in the source code
[10:03:48] <gm____> i think also that it comes from the server. The following i have used and worked but the changing that I done before are gone.
[10:03:50] <gm____> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.0/jquery.min.js"></script> <script> $(document).ready(function() { $('select option:contains("(None)")').text(''); }); </script>
[10:04:55] <gm____> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.0/jquery.min.js"></script> <script> $(document).ready(function() { $('select option:contains("(None)")').text('Select Value'); }); </script>
[10:05:19] <Cork> please don't paste html in the channel
[10:05:23] <Cork> noone is reading it anyway
[10:05:51] <Cork> if you want to ask a jquery question related to this, try reproducing the problem in a jsfiddle
[10:06:36] <Cork> gm____: and also, the option might be added through ajax so when js can hack around this might not be that early
[10:10:05] <gm____> the option is with SharePoint Designer done en linked to a custom list in SharePoint
[10:10:21] <Cork> that info doesn't help me any
[10:11:11] <gm____> If have following the steps on this site : http://wp.ahcheng.com/2015/12/06/enable-search-feature-for-sharepoint-lookup-table-single-value-only/ and it works.
[10:11:38] <gm____> only the none field changing to "Select value"
[10:48:51] <nebulae> I'm a populating a table in a twig for loop. Inside the td I have an id="some_id" but the id is the same for all elements since it's declared inside the loop. Now in jQuery how can I find a specific id ?
[10:49:22] <Cork> nebulae: you can't find the id, but you can find the attribute
[10:49:35] <Cork> (as there is only one element that has the id, the first)
[10:50:04] <nebulae> Cork: thank you. But i I need the click(). Inside the ts there is a button :(
[10:50:04] <Cork> but you should fix the error, as that is invalid html
[10:50:08] <AdamPDotty1> Just don't!
[10:50:25] <nebulae> Cork: what is the error ?
[10:50:32] <Cork> multiple elements with the same id
[10:50:37] <Cork> use a class for example
[10:50:53] <nebulae> Cork: I though I could use the twig counter
[10:51:04] <Cork> nebulae: the html you have is invalid
[10:51:13] <Cork> don't just let it be invalid, fix it
[10:51:37] <nebulae> you mean.. not give the same id.. and give something else
[10:51:50] <Cork> or just change is from id="" to class=""
[10:52:03] <Cork> as it is valid to have the same class on multiple elements
[10:52:32] <Cork> then you just have to know what row you care about and you can from there pick the correct td
[10:52:38] <nebulae> wouldn't it result in the same class again as it is looping through the same elements ?
[10:52:46] <Cork> yes, but that isn't a problem
[10:53:40] <nebulae>  ok.. wait... the problem occurs because the <td> has the same id, not the <tr>
[10:53:46] <Cork> yes
[10:53:58] <Cork> you should never have the same id anywhere in the page
[10:54:04] <nebulae> true
[10:54:18] <Cork> if you do, you are doing it wrong for no good reason
[10:54:26] <Cork> just replace the id with a class and it would work
[10:54:35] <nebulae> so class instead of id would solve it /
[10:54:39] <nebulae> ?
[10:54:58] <Cork> well depending on where you want find the td from, but most likely yes
[10:55:07] <Cork> i am assuming a lot here as you haven't shared any info
[10:56:02] <nebulae> https://pastebin.com/ajUJfuVx
[10:56:08] <nebulae> looks like this
[10:56:19] <nebulae> I changed to class though
[10:56:37] <Cork> that is unprocessed server code, doesn't help me much
[10:56:51] <nebulae> huh.. what would you need?
[10:57:09] <Cork> the html structure the browser works with
[10:57:18] <Cork> and even better a working jsfiddle of the problem
[10:57:57] <nebulae> jsfiddle... well.. I am pulling values from a local elastic search ...
[10:58:55] <nebulae> but anyway ... there is a button that says class="approve" ans class="decline" I want to be able to click each button individually
[10:59:33] <nebulae> wow...
[10:59:37] <nebulae> with class it works
[10:59:39] <nebulae> lol
[11:02:19] <Cork> nebulae: just a small example of how i would do something like that https://jsfiddle.net/7qmafk7a/
[11:02:21] * Cork sfk
[11:02:26] <Cork> *afk
[11:03:11] <nebulae> Thank you..!!!!
[11:17:42] <MikeD_> is it "easy" to make a button background into a progress bar fill over 2 seconds without using an image?
[11:24:10] <jomofcw> Helo !
[11:24:59] <jomofcw> How can i check if a jQuery plugin is loaded ? i've tried "typeof $.myPluginMethod === 'function'" but it seems to doesn't work...
[11:48:56] <jomofcw> fixed ! jQuery().myPlugin
[15:30:38] <robertmaxrees> i have been off this entire week.
[15:31:50] <taplar> you should take some vacation then
[15:32:33] <robertmaxrees> i really need to
[15:32:47] <robertmaxrees> starting to burn out.
[15:32:56] <taplar> i took a much needed one on monday
[15:33:25] <robertmaxrees> I might do that friday.
[18:04:26] <GeekMonkey> Can someone help with this ajax call
[18:04:27] <GeekMonkey> http://pasted.co/99b06420
[18:04:55] <GeekMonkey> this function works but I want to pass the input field value to the function
[18:05:08] <GeekMonkey> the input field is called rating
[18:05:29] <robertmaxrees> "pass the input field to the function"?
[18:05:53] <GeekMonkey> input value to function
[18:05:58] <robertmaxrees> can you show the html?
[18:06:15] <GeekMonkey> <form id="frmSubmitReview" name="frmSubmitReview" class="write-review-section form-inline" action="" method="post" novalidate="novalidate">
[18:06:15] <GeekMonkey>    					<input type="hidden" class="" id="review__overallRating" name="review__overallRating" value="">
[18:06:38] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0u54bb5j/
[18:07:03] <robertmaxrees> guess i'm not clear about what the issue is...
[18:07:44] <robertmaxrees> which function are you trying to pass that input to?
[18:07:47] <GeekMonkey> http://pasted.co/9af7b14d
[18:08:09] <GeekMonkey> the say_hello_function
[18:08:29] <GeekMonkey> instead of echoing out hello I want to echo out the input value
[18:08:29] <robertmaxrees> you mean server-side?
[18:08:35] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:09:16] <robertmaxrees> so you want to pass the input's value via that .get() call?
[18:10:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm not familiar with PHP but I'm like 75% sure that's not how you access querystring params.
[18:11:11] <robertmaxrees> but basically you need to pass that value as apart of the .get(), then access the 'GET' values within your PHP.
[18:15:21] <GeekMonkey> Or how would I do it with jquery?
[18:15:24] <GeekMonkey> or ajax
[18:16:05] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey you can't call the php function directly with JS
[18:16:12] <robertmaxrees> you have to pass that data to your server.
[18:16:18] <robertmaxrees> then your server handles it from there.
[18:19:07] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey are you asking how you'd alert that value without sending it to the server?
[18:39:45] <taplar> i almost had a heart attack today
[18:40:24] <taplar> my tech lead was talking to awkwardCough about some issue with one of the apps and I heard the phrase
[18:40:35] <taplar> "or you could just set async: false"
[18:40:54] <Gh0st_Preacher> {triggered}
[18:41:21] <taplar> quickly followed by me repeatedly saying no
[18:41:23] <taplar> lok
[18:41:28] <taplar> *lol
[18:42:08] <robertmaxrees> https://ajbrosterblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/hell-no-meme-gif-26.gif?w=464&h=379
[18:42:31] <taplar> yeah.  to be fair though, he and I are the most into js on the team
[18:43:01] <taplar> he whipped out a $.when().then() and it was all good
[18:43:21] <robertmaxrees> hah.  ezpz
[18:43:48] <robertmaxrees> it's funny how some people treat JS like it's some kind of Duplo of languages.
[18:43:56] <robertmaxrees> "but it works!"
[18:44:15] <taplar> it's not the best, but it's not broken!
[18:44:27] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other language.
[18:44:32] <robertmaxrees> it has things it's good at and things it's bad at.
[19:02:30] <GeekMonkey> I got it working....
[19:02:35] <GeekMonkey> on another note
[19:02:46] <GeekMonkey> how can I use date() to output just Wed May 30 2018
