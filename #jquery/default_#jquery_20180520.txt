[03:47:35] <anddam> at https://jsfiddle.net/5cuc1pbx/6/ I'm doing some calculation on elements' width in setDatePosition() at +134, or so I would
[03:49:04] <anddam> the width I see logged in console is different than the actual width, in the fiddle I see logged the same value of 24 (px) while the anchors have variable lengths
[03:49:38] <anddam> locally I see different number, still not equal to actual widths of the elements, and not even proportional to those
[03:50:37] <anddam> I added ids attributes thinking the function was working on other elements, but the log call at +134 prints out the exact element in console
[03:51:31] <anddam> I figure something is changing the width of the element after the script has run, but I'm not sure what or -more importantly- how to postpone the execution of the function
[03:52:30] <anddam> from what I read I could  use    jQuery(window).on('load',     rather than jQuery(document).ready(   but when I try I get an error since the jquery object is not found
[03:52:44] <anddam> any hint appreciated
[03:55:07] <anddam> actually switching to 'load' event results in an empty rendered quadrant on jsfiddle
[07:20:04] <salad> I have in a jsfiddle some code that has jquery and it's selected javascript + jquery and works but when i use the code locally  it does not work, and i have added jquery 3.3.1 from google cdn
[07:20:15] <salad> anything else i need to do?
[07:31:55] <thykka> salad, when you say "locally", do you mean from a filesystem or from a local server?
[07:32:27] <thykka> browsers might block loading 3rd party resources when the page is loaded from a file:// url
[08:00:00] <salad> intex.html, style.css and scripts.js run in a browser tab
[08:02:30] <salad> same when running jquery from local
[08:07:28] <salad> oh so uncaught referenceerror $ is not defined
[08:08:54] <thykka> right, your jquery isn't loading
[08:08:57] <salad> but index has <script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
[08:09:04] <thykka> is that file in the same dir?
[08:09:32] <thykka> doesn't look like a cdn url to me :]
[08:10:14] <salad> well it's not because it was suggested that it might not work from cdn
[08:11:05] <thykka> look in devtools' network tab and refresh the page
[08:11:58] <salad> scripts.js has finished and jquery has 200, added cdn back
[08:12:24] <thykka> is scripts.js loaded first?
[08:12:29] <salad> yes
[08:12:46] <thykka> then jquery hasn't initialized yet
[08:12:57] <thykka> try switching their order?
[08:13:01] <salad> aand it's fixed
[08:13:04] <thykka> _b
[09:25:47] <VectorX> hi anyone know of a snippet i can use to do a sidebar like this where the content stops at the top but continues towards the footer http://www.techearl.com/
[09:26:15] <VectorX> sorry this page might be a better example https://www.techearl.com/php/installing-gearman-module-for-php7-on-ubuntu
[10:52:25] <anddam> can someone explain me why line 135 at https://jsfiddle.net/5cuc1pbx/8/ is logging the same the same result for width() for all the for, very different in width, anchors?
[10:52:45] <anddam> I'd like to use it in the function for some calculation, rather than the dates like the original script
[11:26:56] <webdude_> has anyone managed to figure out jquery click() in webview elements? the only way I can seem to get click to work on links in the webview is to cancel the default link action which sort of defeats the purpose
[11:27:04] <webdude_> *iphone webview elements
[11:27:37] <graingert> webdude_: you're trying to simulate a click?
[11:27:42] <graingert> Or listen to clicks?
[11:27:48] <webdude_> listen to clicks
[11:28:04] <graingert> webdude_: what actually happens and what does your code look like
[11:28:49] <webdude_> like i have $('a').click(function...blah blah blah). It should trigger an overloay with a load animation. Works on every platform and browser except ios webview elements
[11:29:03] <webdude_> works on android *snickers a little*
[11:30:01] <webdude_> i hit google and found lots of "workarounds" but nothing worked. The only way it will trigger the proper animation is if the link is broken. It actually triggers fine in airplane mode
[11:30:15] <webdude_> even tried having the app wait a second or two to help it show, nada
[12:03:18] <webdude_> woot, got it working. the event.target.href was close but it still didnt trigger on some links. Kept swearing at it and eventually landed on grabbing the href attrib and using a var outside document ready to hold the link allowing me to use settimeout, which got it to fire properly
[15:45:21] <Nirvash> Any thoughts on how to figure out what part of a script is running slowly? I'm using quicksearch and with 1200 records, it's crawling =/
[16:35:59] <kl_> Why Im having this message : ReferenceError: $_GET is not defined , When trying to do this : https://jsfiddle.net/16cpjx9e/
[16:37:41] <kl_> I'm trying to load dataSelect.php on a div when I come on this page categories.php?t=f  or  categories.php?t=p   by calling load function with data : type =  f  or type = p
[16:41:55] <Woet> kl_: because you can't just put PHP code in jQuery..?
[16:42:09] <Woet> kl_: you gotta actually open PHP tags.
[16:42:32] <kl_> haaaan
[16:44:02] <kl_> thx
[16:44:09] <kl_> Woet
[16:46:19] <BirdZeus> help
[17:02:46] <kl_> Woet Why now I'm having Notice: Undefined index: type  <?php 	include 'dbconnect.php'; 	$type = $_POST['type']; ... ?>
[17:02:48] <kl_> https://jsfiddle.net/16cpjx9e/1/
[17:02:56] <Woet> kl_: your jQuery question being..?
[17:03:13] <kl_> oh
[17:03:57] <kl_> Woet Do I pass my type correctly to getData function ?
[17:04:07] <Woet> I don't know, do you?
[17:04:18] <kl_> $(document).ready(getData(<?php $_GET['t']?>));
[17:04:52] <Woet> kl_: your jQuery question being..?
[17:06:33] <kl_> Woet  is it correct to call a function like this $(document).ready(getData(<?php $_GET['t']?>)); when I come on this page categories.php?t=f or categories.php?t=p ?
[17:06:39] <Woet> kl_: your jQuery question being..?
[17:06:50] <kl_> Woet why are you trolling srsly ?
[17:06:54] <Woet> kl_: in case you're not getting the hint, that has nothing to do with jQuery.
[17:07:17] <kl_> Wtf  https://api.jquery.com/ready/
[17:08:31] <Woet> kl_: the $(document).ready part is correct.
[17:08:39] <Woet> kl_: https://jsfiddle.net/L05hjnzo/
