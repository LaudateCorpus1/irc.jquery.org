[00:08:40] <SlizardWizard> i have var selector1 = $('.foo'); and selector2 = $('bar');
[00:09:39] <SlizardWizard> is there a way i can combine selector1 and selector2 together as variables
[00:09:59] <SlizardWizard> like combined = selector1 + selector2
[00:10:50] <SlizardWizard> i know i could just use $('.foo, .bar') but the selector i am using is very complicated and uses a custom filter that doesn't work when trying to use commas
[00:17:52] <pavonia> SlizardWizard: $(".foo").add(".bar")
[00:33:31] <SlizardWizard> pavonia: but selector2 isn't just '.bar' it is complicated list of element thats aren't children of a certain class
[00:35:01] <pavonia> So?
[00:35:49] <SlizardWizard> pavonia: so i can't just throw it in a string and put it in the add()
[00:37:35] <pavonia> It doesn't have to be a string. Maybe paste an example of what you are really trying to do
[00:38:22] <SlizardWizard> okay give me a second
[00:39:51] <SlizardWizard> pavonia:
[00:39:52] <SlizardWizard> https://gist.github.com/SlizardWizard/6d94a421e276df19493302089933c5ff
[00:41:30] <pavonia> So input.add(select).add(...) should work
[00:41:46] <SlizardWizard> pavonia: well that is pretty easy
[00:42:41] <SlizardWizard> testing it now\
[00:44:32] <SlizardWizard> In my scenario it didn't work, but it is very likely that i messed up somewhere else
[00:47:01] <SlizardWizard> I console.logged the length of all the 4 selectors and then added them to input then logged them again
[00:47:14] <SlizardWizard> first time it was 92, after i added them it was only 67
[00:50:18] <SlizardWizard> oh just read the docs, .add returns a new element rather than mutating
[00:51:24] <SlizardWizard> worked perfectly
[01:24:14] <jak2000> hi all
[04:26:01] <bertdj> hello all, question... is something like this possible? onclick="$.get('http://www.google.com/'); return false;"
[04:27:33] <Cork> bertdj: 1. don't use event attributes, use event handlers, 2. sure as long as www.google.com allows ajax calls from your domain (they have to provide a cors header allowing your domain)
[04:30:41] <bertdj> Cork: with a $.get, how would Google see it's not a regular request?
[04:31:26] <Cork> bertdj: it is more that the browser will check the response and block it if the server doesn't explicitly allow your request
[04:32:00] <Cork> bertdj: there is also a X-Request (or something like that) in the request header
[04:32:09] <Cork> that indicates that it is xhr
[04:32:20] <Cork> but the later doesn't matter for security
[04:34:34] <bertdj> <a href="#" onclick="$.get('http://www.google.com/')">test</a>
[04:34:50] <Cork> again, don't use event attributes
[04:34:51] <bertdj> (without "return:false;") this is not sending me to Google
[04:34:59] <Cork> no cause it is ajax
[04:35:06] <Cork> not url navigation
[04:35:22] <Cork> if you went a link use href
[04:35:40] <bertdj> hm, yeah, but I don't want people to go there
[04:35:46] <Cork> uh...
[04:35:55] <bertdj> google.com is just an example, I have a php script I want to call when people click a link
[04:35:57] <Cork> you want to navigate there but not send ppl there??
[04:36:09] <bertdj> so the PHP script should run but people should stay on the current page
[04:36:13] <bertdj> :)
[05:02:27] <AtiSs> hello here
[05:02:28] <AtiSs> I would need the light of a dev knowing the javascript and more precisely concerning a module of kiwiirc (SideBar) I modified in order to be able to display the avatar of my members in place of those of the sex
[05:02:29] <AtiSs> For its i use image.onabort method, to check if the avatar perso existed or not, however I am obliged to open a first time the private of the user
[05:02:29] <AtiSs> Close it, reopen it for the image to appear, to believe that the variable puts too much time to define itself to display it at the first blow
[05:02:29] <AtiSs> thank you in advance
[05:02:29] <AtiSs> (I posted on a devs forum with the code if needed I would provide you the link)
[05:03:12] <Cork> AtiSs: please split the question and description
[05:22:06] <bsdnoob> hey how can I replace clicked button with image?
[05:22:26] <Woet> by writing the code to do so.
[05:23:23] <bsdnoob> Woet, correct
[05:23:29] <Woet> go ahead
[05:23:33] <bsdnoob> there there any method for such a task ?
[05:23:39] <Woet> of course.
[05:23:41] <bsdnoob> replace element directly ?
[05:23:45] <Woet> yes.
[05:23:58] <bsdnoob> what's that method called ?
[05:24:21] <bsdnoob> by method I mean function  :P
[05:26:10] <Woet> bsdnoob: what have you googled for so far? which documentation did you read? what have you tried so far?
[05:31:38] <Cork> bsdnoob: $(this).replaceWith('<img>')
[05:33:32] <Woet> Cork doesn't want people to learn apparently
[05:34:10] <Cork> Woet: if they are asking in here it means they haven't been able to find it
[05:34:21] <Woet> you vastly overestimate people
[05:34:41] <Uhkis> you guys need to find some middle-ground there :P
[05:34:44] <Woet> 90% of the questions here can be answered by googling and reading the first result
[05:34:59] <Cork> i would say 99%
[05:35:02] <Woet> the majority of people asking questions doesn't google or read documentation
[05:35:10] <Uhkis> Woet: and now you overestimate peoples google-fu
[05:35:22] <Cork> though googling has the problem that there are a LOT of bad answers out there
[05:35:29] <Woet> "jquery replace element"
[05:35:33] <Woet> yes, very difficult
[05:35:44] <Woet> first result: .replaceWith() | jQuery API Documentation
[05:35:45] <Cork> or just go to api.jquery.com and search for replace
[05:35:49] <Woet> sure
[05:35:59] <Woet> like i said, the majority doesnt even attempt it, else they wouldn't be asking
[05:36:22] <Woet> so I dislike giving people the answer because it doesn't teach them anything
[05:36:28] <Woet> give a man a fish etc etc
[05:36:29] <Cork> i'm not arguing with you, i'm just not going to sit and help them type the query
[05:36:38] <Woet> fair enough
[05:37:19] <Cork> depending on what mood i'm in i might point them to lmgtfy.com
[05:38:37] <Uhkis> Woet: you still could've gone to the "what have you googled so far" before those wiseass comments :P
[05:39:15] <Woet> Uhkis: i could have
[05:40:19] <Uhkis> Woet: yes, that's what i said ;)
[06:29:41] <Nancy2012> I m using bootstrap drag and drop feature to upload images(https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/bootstrap-drag-and-drop-upload) but whenver I send images to upload via ajax post method. It shows empty data on php side. here is my code (https://pastebin.com/hBeNvkDH)
[06:30:35] <Cork> Nancy2012: you need to use formData
[06:30:47] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[06:31:25] <Cork> you can't convert files into an object or paramstring so ajax can normally not handle them
[06:31:36] <Cork> that is why FormData was added
[06:31:48] <Nancy2012>  I understand similiar to this.var formData = new FormData(); formData.append('file', $(this)[0].files[0]);
[06:32:29] <Cork> yes
[06:34:38] <Nancy2012> thanks :)
[09:24:41] <ahn> hi guys
[09:26:46] <ahn> Is there a way to trigger jquery datepicker beforeShowDay each time calendar is display ?
[09:27:18] <ahn> i'm using 2 inline datepicker which i display with jquery mobile tabs
[09:28:39] <ahn> the function beforeShowDay  is called just one time at the initialize
[09:57:29] <dimm> hello! question related to datatables. is this possible do not send initial request?
[10:06:13] <momomo> input.is(":focus") is always returning false
[10:06:15] <momomo> why??
[10:09:57] <Woet> momomo: why dont you tell me? https://jsfiddle.net/y6y2Lwpn/
[10:12:50] <momomo> Woet: setInterval?
[10:13:01] <Woet> momomo: just to show you the code works fine.
[10:16:44] <momomo> Woet: this is my real example
[10:16:52] <momomo> it uses keyboard event
[10:16:52] <momomo> https://jsfiddle.net/y6y2Lwpn/1/
[10:16:57] <momomo> doesn't seem to weokr
[10:17:21] <momomo> Woet: here is a better example: https://jsfiddle.net/y6y2Lwpn/2/
[10:17:52] <Woet> momomo: how do you expect $(this) to magically refer to the input field?
[10:18:35] <momomo> well, ok .. that was a mistake .. in my code it's different ...
[10:18:39] <momomo> let my fix that
[10:18:56] <momomo> ok, now it works
[10:19:05] <momomo> not sure what the is the problem with my code
[10:19:11] <Woet> momomo: next time, just start your question with a link to the code that actually has an issue
[10:19:19] <Woet> momomo: instead of starting with "input.is(":focus") is always returning false" (which works fine)
[10:19:27] <Woet> momomo: and then creating a test case which also works fine
[11:05:14] <reynierpm> hi there, can I get some ideas here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44569978/how-to-populate-a-select2-element-on-open-event-through-an-ajax-call ??
[11:49:28] <catbadger> hey
[11:49:50] <catbadger> anyone in here use cordova? #cordova is a ghost town and I'm just curious if jq can be used inside cordova.
[11:52:52] <Woet> catbadger: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/cordova-jquery-mobile/
[11:53:03] <Woet> second google result
[11:53:44] <catbadger> Woet. jquerymobile is not jquery
[11:55:27] <Woet> catbadger: what do you need that jquery mobile doesnt provide?
[11:56:48] <catbadger> Woet does not matter. thank you for help.
[11:57:03] <Woet> catbadger: you know jQuery mobile includes jQuery right?
[11:57:34] <catbadger> yeah, i'm kind of embarassed I asked now.
[11:58:12] <catbadger> I wanted a cleaner ajax call, but I'm able to do what i want in core js... as per usual, I don't even need jquery
[11:58:40] <catbadger> dude, you'd think i'd be out of dumb questions by this time...
[11:58:42] <Woet> catbadger: true, you never /need/ jQuery, its a framework. it just makes things easier.
[11:58:47] <catbadger> yups
[11:58:58] <robertmaxrees> *library ;)
[11:59:09] <catbadger> hi robertmaxrees.
[11:59:12] <catbadger> :)
[11:59:14] <robertmaxrees> morning
[11:59:18] <Woet> fair enough
[12:20:02] <WebDevB> I know this might be a long shot but does anything know of a package or a snippet of where I could pinch something like this from?
[12:20:03] <WebDevB> http://www.wilton.com/stores/
[12:20:34] <robertmaxrees> the store locator?
[12:21:58] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: yea
[12:22:07] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/maps/solutions/store-locator/simple-store-locator
[12:22:16] <robertmaxrees> i mean, google maps has tutorials for that kind of thing.
[12:22:26] <catbadger> yups
[12:23:05] <WebDevB> robertmaxrees: hmmmm thanks for this... I'll take a look now.
[12:23:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:37:38] <ChrisCwmbran_> Im loading two "subpages" into divs using $.ajax( .... ) and then trying in $( document ).ready to give focus to an input box on the main page but it isnt working. Can anyone assist please?
[12:40:38] <ChrisCwmbran_> https://jsfiddle.net/bzxL81rr/
[12:40:47] <ChrisCwmbran_> My JS code is there
[12:43:05] <ChrisCwmbran_> And added the relevant bits of html: https://jsfiddle.net/bzxL81rr/1/
[12:45:32] <robertmaxrees> document ready is only for the "parent" page.
[12:45:54] <robertmaxrees> gotta use $.ajax().then() for any stuff you wanna do after those divs load.
[12:48:52] <robertmaxrees> ChrisCwmbran ^
[12:49:30] <ChrisCwmbran_> https://jsfiddle.net/bzxL81rr/2/
[12:49:40] <ChrisCwmbran_> Like the displayTable1 there?
[12:49:54] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[12:54:47] <ChrisCwmbran_> Ive changed it thus: https://jsfiddle.net/bzxL81rr/3/  but its still not doing it for me
[12:57:15] <robertmaxrees> does each of those includes have their own #filter ?
[12:58:25] <ChrisCwmbran_> #filter is part of the page they are included into
[12:58:38] <robertmaxrees> and the focus isn't working?
[12:58:44] <robertmaxrees> or what?
[12:58:47] <ChrisCwmbran_> Nope :/
[12:59:04] <robertmaxrees> also: then and done are basically the same thing.
[12:59:51] <robertmaxrees> (not exactly, but you cna just use .then() for both cases.
[13:00:40] <ChrisCwmbran_> Ok Ive changed again but still without luck to: https://jsfiddle.net/bzxL81rr/4/
[13:01:03] <taplar> what is that in the html section?
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> are you getting any errors in your console or anything?
[13:01:31] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/bzxL81rr/5/
[13:01:33] <robertmaxrees> does this work?
[13:01:38] <robertmaxrees> just the initial focus?
[13:05:50] <ChrisCwmbran_> Oddly, no it doesnt
[13:06:22] <robertmaxrees> and no errors?
[13:06:49] <ChrisCwmbran_> Nope. No errors
[13:07:06] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you slap console.log($('[id="filter"]').length); right before that first focus call
[13:08:15] <ChrisCwmbran_> It echoes 1 to the console
[13:10:53] <robertmaxrees> window.onload = function() { document.getElementById("filter").focus() }; maybe?
[13:11:45] <ChrisCwmbran_> Even that doesnt give the input box focus
[13:12:03] <robertmaxrees> i smell something really funky going on.
[13:17:51] <ChrisCwmbran_> I can't say I understand it - but then Im very new to jQuery and JS really
[13:18:17] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you testing in?
[13:18:27] <robertmaxrees> and are there any plugins or anything in play?
[13:18:35] <ChrisCwmbran_> At the moment Edge
[13:18:41] <ChrisCwmbran_> I can try it in another if you wish though
[13:18:51] <robertmaxrees> nah shouldn't need to.
[13:18:52] <ChrisCwmbran_> I have Chrome and Firefox installed
[13:19:05] <robertmaxrees> just making sure it isn't something super old :)
[13:19:46] <taplar> it's an input that has the id on it?
[13:20:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:20:33] <taplar> can you hit tab enough times that the element gets focus?
[13:21:29] <taplar> wanting to make sure it is a focusable element in the first place
[13:22:18] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/b4f9ac5b81c1
[13:22:20] <robertmaxrees> like, this works.
[13:22:20] <ChrisCwmbran_> When the page is first loaded tab moves between the controls of the browser. If I click on the window background it then tabs through the elements of the page. Its as if for some reason the browser itself has focus
[13:22:57] <robertmaxrees> your page has valid markup, right?
[13:23:14] <ChrisCwmbran_> What do you mean?
[13:23:40] <robertmaxrees> exactly that heh.  like, you have a doctype, closing all tags you should, etc.
[13:24:06] <ChrisCwmbran_> As far as I can tell yes
[13:24:13] <ChrisCwmbran_> Edge is complaining about any tags etc
[13:24:17] <taplar> is it possible to see verbatum the html that is generated?
[13:24:27] <taplar> no the echo stuff
[13:24:31] <taplar> *not
[13:24:35] <robertmaxrees> ^ copy the page source off that initial pageload.
[13:24:40] <ChrisCwmbran_> Its not exposed on the net but I can paste what it renders in the browser
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> that'd be perfect.
[13:25:59] <ChrisCwmbran_> https://jsfiddle.net/bzxL81rr/6/
[13:26:06] <ChrisCwmbran_> I pasted it all into the HTML tab
[13:26:37] <ChrisCwmbran_> There are a number of css includes - I apologise for that - its a long story
[13:27:46] <ChrisCwmbran_> Im quite new to websites btw to please go easy on me :P
[13:29:30] <taplar> no body or html close?
[13:30:21] <ChrisCwmbran_> Lines 202 and 203?
[13:31:14] <taplar> oh wow, tidy actually removed them
[13:31:17] <taplar> nvm
[13:31:55] <taplar> or they are hidden behind the yellow warnings
[13:33:22] <taplar> i don't see anything that should keep it from focusing
[13:33:30] <taplar> but you said on page load, tabbing never went to it?
[13:33:38] <ChrisCwmbran_> nope
[13:33:45] <taplar> until you clicked on the page itself?
[13:33:59] <ChrisCwmbran_> It moves focus through the buttons on the browser until I click on the background
[13:34:08] <ChrisCwmbran_> page background*
[13:34:12] <ChrisCwmbran_> Then tab works fine
[13:34:12] <taplar> ball park question.  this isn't in an iframe is it?
[13:34:25] <ChrisCwmbran_> nope
[13:36:23] <taplar> hummm
[13:37:57] <robertmaxrees> labels as descendents of anchors seems off to me.
[13:38:34] <robertmaxrees> also: <div id="clear-both"></div> - you repeat this ID a few times.
[13:38:53] <ChrisCwmbran_> The drop down menus were written by a 3rd party
[13:39:06] <ChrisCwmbran_> Yeah I guess clear-both should be a class
[13:39:10] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out possible culprits
[13:40:11] <robertmaxrees> try moving that window onload bit out of the document ready handler.
[13:41:00] <ChrisCwmbran_> You mean put it on its own? Or delete it?
[13:41:28] <robertmaxrees> move it out.
[13:41:32] <robertmaxrees> like, put it before or after.
[13:41:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:42:16] <ChrisCwmbran_> Tried. No change
[13:42:54] <taplar> really weird.  i keep thinking frames or iframe for this issue
[13:43:09] <robertmaxrees> try commenting out all other js and just leave that onload.
[13:44:00] <ChrisCwmbran_> Still no change
[13:44:23] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing that copy with us?
[13:44:28] <robertmaxrees> wonder what that markup looks like.
[13:44:57] <taplar> when you get the markup, don't right click on the page to get it
[13:45:10] <taplar> go up to your browser bar and get it from those options
[13:45:53] <taplar> Ctrl+U for IE it looks like
[13:46:18] <robertmaxrees> from the dev tools?
[13:46:40] <ChrisCwmbran_> https://jsfiddle.net/bzxL81rr/8/
[13:46:52] <taplar> no from the toolbar.  Alt Key -> View -> Source
[13:47:18] <taplar> just want to make sure he's not getting a nested (i)frame source by doing the right clicking
[13:47:18] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't work with edge fwiw :)
[13:47:21] <taplar> bah
[13:47:56] <taplar> some of us use respectable browsers, :D
[13:48:08] <robertmaxrees> edge IS respectable ;)
[13:48:42] <robertmaxrees> ChrisCwmbran just for giggles, try commenting out the CSS file includes, too.
[13:48:43] <taplar> looks like the focus is working in that fiddle
[13:50:34] <ChrisCwmbran_> Dropped the style sheets, refreshed the page. Still no focus on the input field
[13:50:53] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure you're clearing cache?
[13:51:04] <ChrisCwmbran_> Yep
[13:51:09] <robertmaxrees> because that markup works for me if I paste it into an html file and open in edge
[13:51:53] <taplar> did you get that source by Ctrl+U or right clicking?
[13:52:08] <robertmaxrees> taplar there's no Ctrl-U in edge heh
[13:52:21] <taplar> https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000746.htm  says there is.  ?
[13:52:27] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean the dev tools?
[13:52:38] <taplar> oh, so Ctrl-U does the dev tools?
[13:52:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:52:44] <taplar> bah
[13:52:51] <taplar> well, i guess that would work too
[13:53:03] <taplar> if there is a frame the source there should show it
[13:56:16] <ChrisCwmbran_> Incidentally I tried commenting out the navigation and that made no difference to the problem either
[13:58:17] <robertmaxrees> taplar has a legit suggestion - go to the edge dev tools, click dom explorer, right click the html tag and click "copy" then share that with us.
[13:58:27] <robertmaxrees> won't include the doctype but that should be fine.
[13:59:49] <ChrisCwmbran_> https://jsfiddle.net/bzxL81rr/9/
[13:59:52] <ChrisCwmbran_> There you go
[14:00:11] <taplar> i'm out of ideas then lol
[14:01:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that works if I just load the markup.
[14:01:16] <robertmaxrees> sooooo i have no idea.
[14:01:24] <ChrisCwmbran_> Hmm oh well
[14:01:34] <ChrisCwmbran_> I guess all I can say is thanks for trying anyway both of you :)
[14:21:48] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/mf7kfcrf/1/ -> element id is #terms its not registering that its been checked. I tried prop also, still nothing
[14:22:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:22:32] <robertmaxrees> it's not checked.
[14:22:43] <impliednude> I have clicked it to be checked..
[14:22:46] <impliednude> or am I missing something
[14:22:51] <robertmaxrees> so you want that to log after you click it?
[14:23:21] <robertmaxrees> need an event handler for that.
[14:23:28] <robertmaxrees> the code doesn't keep constantly checking to see if something happenhed.
[14:23:29] <impliednude> yep
[14:23:39] <robertmaxrees> gotta tell it to watch for an event of some kind.
[14:24:01] <MikeD_> you could also default the check state in the html
[14:24:03] <robertmaxrees> for that kind of element, you want the change event.,
[14:24:42] <MikeD_> ex: https://jsfiddle.net/mf7kfcrf/2/
[14:25:05] <robertmaxrees> no need for a value on boolean attributes.
[14:25:07] * hlve slaps MikeD_ with a trout.
[14:25:21] <hlve> praise be.
[14:25:32] <robertmaxrees> and his question was about how to detect when they've changed :)
[14:26:02] <MikeD_> oh, i thought the question was about whether to use .is(':checked') or .prop('checked')
[14:26:26] <MikeD_> rather than add a handler, i assumed setting the initial state would be sufficiently detectable.
[14:27:15] <impliednude> basically, I ran into an issue. For woocommerce, if users on a desktop browser autofill it doesn't update the tax area. so my way of handling that is when the user selects the I accept the terms and conditions it refreshes the browser.
[14:27:29] <impliednude> via ajax.
[14:27:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you want that change handler :)
[14:28:21] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> can you provide a small code example :/
[14:28:29] <impliednude> it would be greatly appreciated!
[14:28:41] <robertmaxrees> .on() is the method.
[14:28:49] <robertmaxrees> takes the event and the function you wanna run.
[14:29:01] <robertmaxrees> $('someselector').on('event', function() {});
[14:29:56] <impliednude> $('#terms').change(function() ?
[14:30:00] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[14:30:05] <impliednude> okay
[14:30:07] <robertmaxrees> does the exact same thing.
[14:30:21] <robertmaxrees> .change() just uses .on('change' under the hood
[14:46:56] * impliednude sighs.
[14:47:11] <impliednude> the events not kicking in.
[14:47:17] <robertmaxrees> show yer code?
[14:47:34] <robertmaxrees> also: make sure your js is either coming after the button OR in a doc ready
[14:48:11] <impliednude> it is on the jsfiddle. just not on my site
[14:48:29] <robertmaxrees> are you meeting the criteria i just mentioned?
[14:48:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:52:14] <impliednude> I put in footer of the doc just tomake sure
[14:52:26] <impliednude> would it matter if the element is generated by js?
[14:52:46] <impliednude> and doc ready.. hm
[14:52:47] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:52:59] <robertmaxrees> that means you want a delegated listener instead.
[15:08:43] <impliednude> How can I do a window.onload I tried it and it doesn't work due to my ignorance.
[15:08:55] <impliednude> I had hoped I could just load the js after everything else
[15:13:00] <rickymiller> window.onload = function() {}; or: window.addEventListener('load', function() {});
[15:14:56] <impliednude> What if I am inlining my events into html
[15:15:08] <impliednude> function has no name.
[15:15:19] <impliednude> right now its just a change function
[15:15:43] <impliednude> I know I should make it a function with name properly but its just 4 freaking lines
[15:17:06] <impliednude> and doing window.onload = function() {insert jquery code here }; doesn't work
[15:19:28] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/vL9gpp5o/ and I need to load it onload after everything else.
[15:21:20] <goodenough> https://jsfiddle.net/vL9gpp5o/1/
[15:39:19] <robertmaxrees> impliednude did you see my suggestion about using a delegated listener?
[15:39:24] <robertmaxrees> onload won't work for that.
[16:27:37] <knew2this> Hello all.  I am a relatively new programmer, and in my short time programming, i have always been more foused on backend stuff like Node, AWS services, database stuff, with a little bit of front end experience.  So if anyone could help me with creating some dynamic forms or direct me to a good source for reading up on them I would be greatly appreciative
[16:27:56] <robertmaxrees> "dynamic forms"?
[16:28:03] <knew2this> dynamically created
[16:28:20] <robertmaxrees> kind of a broad topic.  could you be a little more specific with what you're trying to do?
[16:28:24] <knew2this> Like, they fill out one form, hit a button, and the 2nd form pops up
[16:28:36] <knew2this> with the ability to hit another button and go back a level
[16:28:55] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty basic stuff.  simple jquery, really.
[16:29:03] <robertmaxrees> you're just hiding/showing elements.
[16:29:15] <knew2this> But they need to be able to create as many as they want
[16:29:17] <knew2this> not a set amount
[16:29:26] <robertmaxrees> that's fine, too.
[16:29:37] <knew2this> Its basically like this:
[16:30:10] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:30:43] <knew2this> exposure form -->  hazard form --> type of exposure --> Safety steps, Safety Steps, Safety steps <done> ---> exposure form
[16:30:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  that's pretty easy stuff.
[16:30:59] <robertmaxrees> just hiding/showing elements.
[16:31:14] <knew2this> Can you tell me somewhere good to read up on it?
[16:31:21] <knew2this> I have a basic understanding of front end stuff
[16:31:28] <knew2this> but i am far from any good at it
[16:31:35] <knew2this> <--noob
[16:31:56] <robertmaxrees> there's not really any resource for "dynamic forms" that I can think of.  the basic idea is really simple though.
[16:31:59] <knew2this> I feel like I can read code and see whats going on if I had some decent examples
[16:32:06] <knew2this> maybe they arent called dynamically created forms
[16:32:14] <knew2this> i thought that is what you call them when they are created like that
[16:32:29] <knew2this> thats what they keep referring them to me as
[16:32:32] <robertmaxrees> the name isn't really important.
[16:32:46] <knew2this> lol yes i agree
[16:32:57] <robertmaxrees> the basic concept is very simple tho.  where are you getting stuck?
[16:34:00] <knew2this> Well right now, I am basically using javascript functions ran onclick but they arent jquery, that use style.display = "none" and "block".  I am trying to create all the steps i mentioned in 1 form tag
[16:34:24] <robertmaxrees> so you should really check out learn.jquery.com and try.jquery.com to get your head around jq basics.
[16:34:25] <knew2this> I am unsure as to how to make buttons that will let them skip a step if need be, or go back a step if need be
[16:34:34] <robertmaxrees> also: https://codepen.io/atakan/pen/gqbIz this is one take on your idea.
[16:34:38] <knew2this> Hey thats great
[16:34:41] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of "multi step forms"
[17:53:54] <brekfist> i have an object on which I'd like to impose more hierarchy. Here's what I mean: https://jsfiddle.net/gangstermath/w9scrL1u/ . What's the correct way?
[17:54:04] <robertmaxrees> "correct"?
[17:54:17] <brekfist> (I have a lot of control over names & order of properties)
[17:54:19] <robertmaxrees> to get it from one format to another you mean?
[17:54:55] <brekfist> Yeah I want more hierarchy, so that I can easily grab a property group at a time to use elsewhere
[17:55:10] <robertmaxrees> hard to know without seeing an actual sample of data.
[17:55:38] <brekfist> It's html form data, just text.
[17:56:07] <robertmaxrees> are you punting this to a server?
[17:56:11] <robertmaxrees> to process there?
[17:56:30] <brekfist> probably clientside, but it's not huge, doesn't matter
[17:56:43] <robertmaxrees> so can you flesh out a bit more with real data?
[17:56:58] <robertmaxrees> sorry, it's really difficult without a concrete example of the data itself.
[17:57:07] <brekfist> not sure what you mean -- the data is just arbitrary strings
[17:57:20] <robertmaxrees> lolsecond form
[17:57:29] <robertmaxrees> *lol - your second format makes references to groups.
[17:57:41] <robertmaxrees> without seeing how the data relates, or even IF it relates, would be helpful.
[17:57:44] <brekfist> the important part is what i'm doing with it. I want to be able to iterate through properties for each "group" (eg, myoject.group1.each()   )
[17:57:59] <robertmaxrees> then those groups shjould be arrayus.
[17:58:01] <robertmaxrees> *arrays
[17:58:16] <brekfist> ahhh. that's an interesting point
[17:58:18] <brekfist> hmmm
[17:58:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:58:40] <robertmaxrees> but that really depends.
[17:58:43] <robertmaxrees> for instance
[17:59:00] <robertmaxrees> what is a "group"?  is it a concrete object or a collection of objects?
[17:59:52] <brekfist> when the form gets parsed it comes out as a flat one-dimensional object. so turning them into arrays is just the sort of thing i'm talking about. but how to do that? should i iterate through object properties and for each one ask if its name starts with "group1"? or....
[18:00:15] <robertmaxrees> heh, that's whjere I need a better example oif the data you're working with./
[18:00:25] <brekfist> the group is a short list of properties to be used in the same context. a group is, itself, one-dimensional
[18:00:35] <robertmaxrees> imo i'd format that data whjen you pull it from the dom.
[18:02:02] <robertmaxrees> depending on what the data itself is, maybe an array of groups, each one an array of items makes sense?
[18:02:08] <robertmaxrees> hard to know (shrug)
[18:03:07] <brekfist> hmm. I'm using    $(form).serializeArray()  -- it seemed clean, but I guess you're saying that if I have to sift thru stuff later....
[18:03:12] <brekfist> I might as well do it up front?
[18:03:28] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:03:54] <brekfist> Hmm that's a good thought. I'll play with that. Thanks for the chat
[18:22:19] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/pFYUM/260/ - return null because the button element is loaded by javascript.
[18:22:46] <impliednude> and I have no idea what a delegated listener list
[18:22:48] <impliednude> is*
[18:22:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:22:57] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[18:23:07] <robertmaxrees> also: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[18:25:14] <impliednude> give me an ecma language that's not so confusing or requires me to learn chinese...
[18:25:21] <impliednude> problem is there is no such thing
[18:25:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:25:49] <impliednude> I am a php person. not a js person. it just literally confuses me
[18:26:02] <robertmaxrees> ah, didn't go through the jquery learning center yet?
[18:26:17] <impliednude> that even confuses me
[18:26:23] <robertmaxrees> and js isn't that hard tbh.  the DOM is.
[18:26:23] <taplar> what's confusing ya?
[18:26:27] <robertmaxrees> so where are you confus..
[18:26:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah that.
[18:26:49] <impliednude> I need a cheat sheet with examples that I can use
[18:26:55] <impliednude> not to really learn the language honestly.
[18:27:03] <taplar> eh
[18:27:06] <impliednude> I am an old person
[18:27:22] <taplar> kinda like saying you just need instructions to the car
[18:27:23] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/KCj3AQc.png
[18:27:25] <taplar> not learn how to drive
[18:27:37] <robertmaxrees> that shows you the direct binding vs the delegated binding.
[18:27:54] <robertmaxrees> though, admittedly, the docs assume you have a grasp of the basics.
[18:28:09] <robertmaxrees> because I'm bored, https://jsfiddle.net/pFYUM/261/
[18:28:35] <robertmaxrees> $('.some-ancestor') would be an ancestor element that exists when you do the binding.
[18:30:19] <Aljone> hey guys i have some issue , i have object wwith arround 20k elements, each element represent customr.
[18:30:32] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy.
[18:30:35] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:30:38] <taplar> lol
[18:30:48] <taplar> unclench your keyboard robert
[18:30:51] <robertmaxrees> please don't say you want to sort it on the client
[18:30:59] <Aljone> now i have input field when user can text and search users so everytime he is writing i loop over the object find the matching customer create the html and put it in the html
[18:31:07] <robertmaxrees> called it
[18:31:24] <robertmaxrees> 20k is too much.  server-side, use ajax if you don't want a pageload.
[18:31:29] <taplar> ^
[18:31:35] <Aljone> when write the first letter and ihave alot of result it take LONG TIME TO show the html and the browser stuck
[18:31:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:31:41] <fiord> LOL
[18:31:51] <fiord> hoo boy indeed
[18:31:52] <Aljone> robertmaxrees: ajax wont help
[18:31:53] <robertmaxrees> because you have an excess of data for the client to churn through.
[18:31:54] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> that I know. I just feel overwhelmed by all the knowledge I have to aqquire these days.
[18:32:01] <robertmaxrees> Aljone doing that client-side is the problem.
[18:32:15] <robertmaxrees> setup an endpoint on your server to do the filter and return the data.
[18:32:18] <Aljone> even if i have ajax i still get reply arround 8k result and making it html and show it its too much
[18:32:30] <robertmaxrees> Aljone that's why you also debounce it.
[18:32:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:32:40] <Aljone> debounce?
[18:32:48] <taplar> you may also be building it in such a way that you are redrawing like a sumbitch
[18:32:53] <Aljone> u mean dont return all results just limit it by X amount?
[18:32:54] <robertmaxrees> don't run the query until the user has stopped typing after x amoutn of time.
[18:33:18] <taplar> i'd be interested in seeing your logic that builds the html and puts it on the page
[18:33:20] <robertmaxrees> i mean your server should only return the relevant results, but only do it after the user has probably stopped typinmg.
[18:33:32] <robertmaxrees> ^ also the logic building the markup is probably causing a lot of DOM thrashing.
[18:33:50] <Aljone> i just repalce the html inside the list
[18:34:04] <taplar> what list?
[18:34:08] <robertmaxrees> heh, are you doing a bunch of .append() calls to the page?
[18:34:18] <Aljone> <div id="list"></div> ... my fucnction buiding all the html adnd then #list").html(html)
[18:34:25] <taplar> k
[18:34:28] <victorqueiroz> Hi. What's the best way to encode a string with emojis into a uint8array?
[18:34:29] <Aljone> no, not append
[18:34:45] <robertmaxrees> Aljone then yeah, filter server-side and ajax your business in.
[18:34:49] <taplar> victorqueiroz: might ask ##javascript
[18:34:52] <Aljone> i assign all html results into varible and then use .html to change the html in the element
[18:35:13] <Aljone> robertmaxrees: ok or i might be limiting the result by at least 2 chars
[18:35:47] <robertmaxrees> Aljone so long as you do the other things i mentioned.
[18:36:00] <taplar> i'd possibly limit the results too.  potentially make them filter further if the results are over so many
[18:36:14] <Aljone> yeah
[18:36:15] <Aljone> ill do it
[18:36:19] <Aljone> thanks guys
[18:36:44] <robertmaxrees> ^ even google limits to like 100 pages or something.
[18:37:04] <robertmaxrees> or at least used to
[18:47:16] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> I kinda got the idea. but I still don't understand how to do that with this https://jsfiddle.net/vL9gpp5o/
[18:48:03] <robertmaxrees> .on('change'
[18:48:23] <robertmaxrees> and then it's the same basic format.
[18:51:21] <robertmaxrees> just gotta target an ancestor that exists on pageload.
[19:02:30] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/pFYUM/262/ - this is what's confusing to me. on my site, it doesn't run -sighs-
[19:03:15] <impliednude> in php, if you write it, it doesn't just stop working for no reason.
[19:04:58] <impliednude> apparent reason that is
[19:16:49] <jak2000> hi all
[19:16:56] <jak2000> how to detect if F12 was pressed?
[19:26:22] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> it's kinda frustrating though. so I added the code properly and in jsfiddle. it works. however, I am wondering how much of the page is dynamic and is using jquery / javascript to populate the system's dom elements.
[19:27:27] <impliednude> should I just try body as the element on that?
[19:29:02] <robertmaxrees> impliednude you can do that, but I highly suggest avoiding it.
[19:29:12] <robertmaxrees> also: jquery IS javascript :)
[19:31:38] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> I know this.
[19:32:07] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> every single element up to the column placement of div.col-2 is generated by js.
[19:32:22] <impliednude> so my only choice in this case was to do div.col-2 as the parent element.
[19:34:44] <robertmaxrees> then do that.
[19:34:49] <robertmaxrees> the lower you can go, the better.
[19:35:13] <robertmaxrees> impliednude the problem is that js can't see stuff that doesn't yet exist.
[19:35:33] <robertmaxrees> so when you do jQuery('div.form-row.place-order'), you're only able to bind to it if it's on the page.
