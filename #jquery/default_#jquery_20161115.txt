[00:20:08] <flerfb0rt> how do you get the jquery validator plugin to react to a failure? i know how to use success:
[00:59:50] <SlizardWizard> how does .each run?
[01:00:09] <SlizardWizard> does it wait for the previous code to run completely first? or does it run multiples at the same time?
[01:16:30] <SlizardWizard> and does the selector always start at the top, work down the first tree
[01:16:35] <SlizardWizard> then go to the next one
[01:16:38] <SlizardWizard> like this https://jsfiddle.net/bch2qph6/1/
[01:46:45] <Cork> SlizardWizard: no it doesn't work like that at all
[01:47:07] <Cork> SlizardWizard: $() selects all the elements in the page matching the selector in dom tree order
[01:47:11] <Cork> it creates an array
[01:47:17] <Cork> and .each loops the result array
[01:47:35] <Cork> so each has no knowledge of dom traversal
[01:48:31] <Cork> SlizardWizard: also javascript is single threaded by definition
[01:48:47] <Cork> so it never runs multiple of things at the same time unless you use a webworker
[01:59:32] <lemonsparrow> is there any good loader design depicting querying from database ?
[03:35:43] <anli_> I want to show the validation errors in a html form, is that only shown onsubmit?
[03:47:56] <anli_> What is making those validation message bubbles coming up?
[03:48:43] <henk_> you can check the input with js and if it does not match your requirements you can give them a message
[03:49:11] <anli_> yes, but there are message bubbles built in the browser
[03:49:28] <anli_> I have them on one page, but not on the other, I dont know whats the difference in the code
[03:49:40] <anli_> Well, which difference that makes them break on page 2
[03:50:13] <anli_> element.validity.valid is false for those elements, when I check manually
[03:51:11] <FilipNortic_> anli_: the event that triggers the validation should be the important part
[03:51:26] <anli_> I am not sure what triggers the validation
[03:51:33] <anli_> Should be onsubmit, should it not?
[03:51:40] <anli_> Maybe I have nested forms then
[03:51:58] <FilipNortic_> then you will get the validation errors when trying to submit
[03:52:19] <anli_> I have put the button inside the form, so onsubmit should trigger
[03:52:25] <anli_> I create a handler to check
[03:52:25] <FilipNortic_> if you add extra with cahnge or keyup then it validats on the fly
[03:54:01] <FilipNortic_> if you are using a validation framework or plugin, they often can be configured for when which events to run on
[03:59:30] <anli_> I use the validation builtin the browser
[03:59:45] <anli_> "add extra"?
[03:59:49] <henk_> imo you should disable the validation from the browser
[03:59:52] <henk_> too insecure
[03:59:56] <anli_> Ah, setting custom validation messages, you mean?
[03:59:56] <henk_> and do it on your own
[04:00:13] <anli_> I have done that on one page, works fine, do I need to do that to trigger the other messages?
[04:00:22] <anli_> That actually should show up anyway
[04:00:40] <anli_> Hm, must test that
[04:08:39] <anli_> Looking at the form, it seems like angular has added some info, maybe I should move this discussion to the #angularjs channel
[06:11:30] <queryguy> hello
[06:11:43] <queryguy> how to return a value from ajax
[06:11:48] <queryguy> is it not possible?
[06:13:02] <queryguy> all answers i see just use the respoonse data inside callback..no example shows how to return the value\
[06:13:22] <Cork> queryguy: cause the answer is "you can't"
[06:13:28] <Cork> the callback from ajax is async
[06:13:40] <Cork> so the outer function has already returned when it is called
[06:13:53] <Cork> and that is why a callback is used and not a return value from ajax
[06:14:32] <queryguy> so there is no way? i have to use the response without returning..?
[06:14:44] <queryguy> ok thank u
[06:27:45] <jquery133> yo
[06:27:46] <jquery133> :D
[06:41:16] <ilithium> Mornin' all. Do any of you have experience with jQuery dateTimePicker (of http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/ fame)? I'm seeing an odd problem: I set the 'format' value to 'jS M Y' and, when I select a date, the selected value is overwritten with the current date. If I take out my format option, the correct date is stored. Any ideas?
[07:15:25] <anyonebutme> Hi, I have a question about querySelectors
[07:16:47] <anyonebutme> suppose I have something like this: <span class="summit"><a href="summer"> Sumting </a> Sumting Elz </span>
[07:17:07] <anyonebutme> How do i refer to the  "Sumting Elz" part?
[07:19:01] <anyonebutme> I've tried several thing, like "span[class=summit] > :not(a)", or last-child, and a bunch of other things.
[07:33:21] <sayhi> hey  - i have some weird behaviour on a recursive function which works with selectors.. can anyone explain this behaviour? im trying to traverse hierarchical xhtml and create an array of objects.. but somehow the "root" node gets overwritten by the last node in the hierachy..
[07:33:23] <sayhi> https://jsfiddle.net/m2z718bq/1/
[07:33:48] <sayhi> the console logs the created object
[07:36:13] <sayhi> I'd greatly appriciate any help :)
[07:36:22] <sayhi> stuck on this for an hour
[07:50:46] * AdamPDotty starts at the top.
[07:51:00] <AdamPDotty> $("#content > #projects) is too complicated.
[07:53:11] <AdamPDotty> what you give to toResource() is not a selector
[07:55:56] <AdamPDotty> [0].innerText should be the same as .text()
[07:56:04] <sayhi> ye.. its a jQuery object
[07:56:14] <AdamPDotty> use a variable for $(objectSelector) !
[07:56:31] <AdamPDotty> Do not execute this function again and again!
[07:57:09] <sayhi> kk
[07:57:27] <AdamPDotty> hmm, I am suspicious about resource
[07:57:47] <AdamPDotty> maybe the inner variavble overwrites the outer
[07:57:52] <sayhi> why does it overwrite the first with the last
[07:58:24] <AdamPDotty> I guess it its called by reference.
[07:58:24] <sayhi> shouldnt the function be scoped in a way that it cant overwrite?
[07:58:36] <AdamPDotty> maybe, if you use "var"
[07:59:02] <sayhi> lol, thats it
[07:59:19] <sayhi> .. i thought it'd automatically scope that
[07:59:45] <AdamPDotty> length is already truthy
[07:59:49] <AdamPDotty> no need for >0
[07:59:58] <sayhi> AdamPDotty: thanks a lot
[08:00:11] <sayhi> i like the eplicit notation on that though
[08:00:15] <sayhi> explicit*
[08:00:22] <jquery298> hi, my ajax response contains html, but simply appending it via .append() doesn't show it. why?
[08:00:44] <AdamPDotty> yep, var helps
[08:00:56] <sayhi> AdamPDotty: is there maybe something i can do to simplify this process?
[08:01:06] <sayhi> i started looking for a json parse for xml
[08:01:19] <sayhi> which it kind of is
[08:01:32] <AdamPDotty> There are parsers out there, but I do not know them well.
[08:01:55] <AdamPDotty> it looks pretty straightforward minus some usual bad practices.
[08:02:02] <sayhi> ye.. its also not exactly what im looking for..
[08:02:15] <sayhi> i just want the html nodes to become json objects..
[08:02:45] <AdamPDotty> possibly there is some very easy solution to that, but I am not aware of it.
[08:02:51] <sayhi> i guess its ok like this.. but i can imagine theres a more simplified way
[08:03:03] <sayhi> :)
[08:03:06] <sayhi> anyway thanks again
[08:03:10] <AdamPDotty> jquery298: Did you console.log() it?
[08:03:22] <sayhi> ill refactor a bit and be on my way :)
[08:03:26] <AdamPDotty> fine
[08:03:57] <jquery298> yep, everything's there. it even works with .after, but not .append
[08:05:01] <AdamPDotty> hmm, did you append to an empty-defined element?
[08:05:55] <jquery298> empty-defined?
[08:06:57] <AdamPDotty> like <input> or <image>
[08:07:46] <jquery298> nope, it's a div container
[08:09:01] <AdamPDotty> and its itself appended to the dom?
[08:09:06] <AdamPDotty> and visible ...
[08:14:09] <jquery298> nope, nothing is appended. idk why
[08:14:39] <triggered> hey guys
[08:14:42] <triggered> so im a jquery pro
[08:14:46] <triggered> like 15 years already, easy
[08:14:54] <triggered> but i have a question
[08:15:22] <triggered> i dressed my dog in my sister clothes and pretended its my sister when i fked it does this make my dog a role player ?
[08:20:20] <hassoon> guys i'm trying to figure out how to use the .map() and .get() functions, to access every <td class='here'> in each <tr> and form a set of elements to put in the data: section of $.ajax(), any help ? http://paste.debian.net/895848/
[08:21:13] <triggered> hassoon: kek get atta here, do your own work
[08:21:14] <hassoon> like {elem1 : val1, elem2 : val2 , elem3 : val3, etc}
[08:21:30] <hassoon> triggered: meh troll elsewhere
[08:21:56] <triggered> im not even trolling, you're lazy or stupid and we're supposed to just drop everything we're doing and do your job for you?
[08:22:35] <hassoon> triggered: seriously cut the crap and troll elsewhere
[08:22:45] <triggered> seriously go fuck yourself back to first grade
[08:22:53] <hassoon> triggered: ignored
[08:23:01] <triggered> #triggered
[08:24:18] <triggered> fucking hate people like that
[08:24:30] <triggered> is too lazy to google something, better go annoy people on irc
[08:24:57] <hassoon> triggered: gtfo you understand ?
[08:25:10] <hassoon> i've been googling already
[08:25:35] <hassoon> wait where else are you now in freenode , imma beat you hard there
[08:25:36] <triggered> yeah googling your dick, you pedo
[08:25:53] <triggered> more like beat my dick, amiright
[08:25:54] <anyonebutme> Wow, the trump crap is getting out of control
[08:26:22] <anyonebutme> I can't believe 4chan won!
[08:26:25] <triggered> is not related to trump, this dumb fuck came out of nowhere expecting to be spoonfed, and gets butthurt when is refused
[08:27:09] <anyonebutme> Which dumb fuck are you referring to?
[08:27:13] <anyonebutme> I assume you mean the dog
[08:27:17] <triggered> hassoon
[08:27:18] <hassoon> anyonebutme: yep
[08:27:23] <hassoon> his one do
[08:27:25] <hassoon> * dog
[08:27:26] <hassoon> rofl
[08:27:33] <triggered> go learn jquery dumbass
[08:27:46] <triggered> cant even select an element
[08:28:04] <hassoon> meh can't waste more time with some dumb nab like you
[08:28:05] <hassoon> so long
[08:28:21] <triggered> lol you're just triggered
[08:28:28] <anyonebutme> Yeah, tbh can't stand javascript! doesn't even have sprintf, what sane language would do that
[08:28:30] <triggered> run away and cry
[08:28:50] <triggered> anyonebutme: just hold shift to sprint
[08:28:52] <hassoon> anyonebutme: at least we got jquery :v
[08:28:56] <anyonebutme> lol
[08:29:33] <anyonebutme> back in my days we didn't even have jquery, we had to write lots and lots of code just to get the dumb menu to open
[08:29:46] <hassoon> triggered: okey you're the 15-years experienced pro here, tell me how to do it then
[08:29:54] <triggered> no lol
[08:30:01] <hassoon> triggered: 'cause you don't know :D
[08:30:04] <triggered> im not gonna do your homework for you, go learn it yourself
[08:30:05] <hassoon> fake pro
[08:30:05] <hassoon> :D
[08:30:19] <triggered> you're retarded :D
[08:30:28] <hassoon> nah, you're a false fake tard
[08:30:36] <Uhkis> did you guys miss your naptime or something? try to behave.
[08:30:42] <triggered> shit man i dont come into channels asking syntax questions
[08:30:43] <triggered> you are
[08:30:45] <triggered> like a retord
[08:30:45] <triggered> :D
[08:30:49] <hassoon> Uhkis: you talk to him, not me
[08:30:56] <triggered> he started it
[08:31:11] <hassoon> Uhkis: very obviously he is trying to take the piss out of me
[08:31:59] <triggered> are you an indian?
[08:32:03] <triggered> your english is very broken
[08:32:08] <triggered> as is your programming skills
[08:32:14] <hassoon> it's not
[08:32:29] <anyonebutme> hanssoon: programmers are the most obnoxious arrogant people on the planet (barring Trump+Pence) don't take it seriously, javascript developers are the lowest possible denominator.
[08:32:57] <triggered> kek
[08:33:00] <triggered> source: you
[08:33:10] <anyonebutme> source: anyonebutme
[08:35:27] <Uhkis> hassoon: his point was: show some actual code, don't expect us to write it from scratch. use jsfiddle.net
[08:35:45] <hassoon> Uhkis: i did share a pastebin of the html code
[08:36:09] <Uhkis> hassoon: exactly. it had no actual code whatsoever.
[08:39:16] <anyonebutme> all of this might be true, and hassoon might just be the worst developer ever (idk), but that's no reason to be rude to him
[08:39:59] <anyonebutme> people (like me) come to these chat rooms because they don't know things, not to be patronised.
[08:40:15] <hassoon> anyonebutme: me the worst developer ever? excuse me ?
[08:40:28] <anyonebutme> soz, i'm just following the herd here
[08:40:37] <hassoon> don't follow anything
[08:40:49] <anyonebutme> idk your coding foo
[08:41:52] <triggered> dont make excuses, the guy cant even select an element, he's not even the worst coder ever, he's not a coder at all :/
[08:42:11] <anyonebutme> the point being that peeps can answer, or ask you a question, or ignore you, but there's no reason to give you this shit.
[08:43:15] <hassoon> holy moly this is funny, you guys really need to move on
[08:43:20] <anyonebutme> There might be very talented JQuery devs here, but that in itself does not make them smarter.
[08:43:34] <anyonebutme> ok, move on
[08:46:51] <anyonebutme> hassoon: idk jquery really, but i think what you are trying to do is something like $("tr > td.here")
[08:47:08] <hassoon> anyonebutme: no what i'm trying to know is far beyond that
[08:47:20] <hassoon> whateva i'll try to figure it out
[08:47:40] <triggered> no you wont lol
[09:14:16] <quechon> im building a app with flask is there anyway to use jquery to prevent the page to reload but still alowing it to submit data
[09:16:00] <sillyslux> !ops
[09:16:40] <triggered> {}{_}{} vjjjjiiu
[09:18:30] <Tennis> quechon ajax
[09:21:03] <quechon> i just need ajax to get data once the button is click but i know i can use preventDefault func to prevent the form to from normal behavior but my thing is that the only behavior i want to avoid id refreshing not the submit one
[09:24:16] <AdamPDotty> quechon ajax
[09:27:03] <Kodax> Any idea why this is not working:
[09:27:06] <Kodax>  $('.btn-add-shift', timeContainer).prev().show();
[09:46:44] <rjCousineau> Hi. I'm having trouble copying an element, adding a class, and placing it a second time in the dom (with addClass).   I have: $(el).append( $('#table').clone() );  //works!!!    but.  $(el).append( $('#table').clone().addClass() ); //don't work..
[09:53:08] <hassoon> what do we call that phenomena when we try to associate an event handler to a dynamically-added element
[10:05:54] <hassoon> found it, delegated element
[10:06:34] <rjCousineau> hassoon: They're called "Descendant Elements"
[10:06:48] <hassoon> rjCousineau: i mean delegated events
[10:06:49] <hassoon> d'oh
[10:07:08] <rjCousineau> "Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from descendant elements that are added to the document at a later time."
[10:07:25] <hassoon> rjCousineau: yep
[10:17:43] <hlve> yep!
[10:42:29] <shakaponk> hello, i have a question: on document.ready myelement.position() retrieves top 1125 and after some actions the same call returns 2330 although the element is still at the same position… why is that?
[11:04:23] <quechon_> how can i pass a flask variable to get() in jquery
[11:54:58] <emx> how is it possible that despite remote rule in jquery validator, the form is valid although the ajax request has not yet been sent?
[12:06:13] <regedit> is there a way to use $.when() (or other jquery facilities?) in order to invoke event listeners in a synchronous manner, and even return a value to the triggering/calling point?
[12:06:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:07:00] <regedit> how can i call event listeners synchronously and return a value
[12:07:46] <robertmaxrees> you can't return a value.
[12:07:55] <robertmaxrees> and they ARE synchronous.
[12:08:11] <robertmaxrees> could you provide more detail on what you're trying to do?
[12:09:27] <regedit> trying to make a sort of "hooking" mechanism, where at some point in my code i kinda say "ok at this point lets invoke any functions that have been hooked to this event, and pay attention to their return value(s)"
[12:10:09] <regedit> i thought maybe some event listeners with synchronous capabilities might exist and do the trick, but maybe not
[12:11:09] <regedit> i had understood that events are asynchronous, i.e. they actually execute the callbacks after the current execution completes all scripts
[12:11:42] <regedit> but i need it to be synchronous so that these hooks can return values to the code invoking the hooks
[12:12:06] <regedit> if you're familiar with WordPress development you'd know exactly what i mean by hooks (and filters)
[12:13:53] <regedit> robertmaxrees: ^ am i failing to make any sense at all? :D
[12:15:45] <robertmaxrees> sorry i had to step away for a minute.
[12:16:29] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating what async means
[12:16:41] <robertmaxrees> and you cannot return values out of event handlers.
[12:17:22] <regedit> does jquery maybe have other facilities available to use as such a hook/filter system?
[12:18:08] <robertmaxrees> not really - jquery is a DOM abstraction library.  you're looking to build a kind of complicated pub/sub system.
[12:18:49] <robertmaxrees> why are you wanting to hook all of this into events?
[12:19:42] <dglambert> yo
[12:19:46] <regedit> doesn't seem *that* complicated in principle http://stackoverflow.com/a/20132960 but i guess jquery doesnt have anything like that to use
[12:20:23] <regedit> robertmaxrees: doesn't have to be "events" per se, i thought events might serve the purpose but really anything that has the hooks/filters effect is fine for me
[12:20:29] <robertmaxrees> regedit the original question there and what you're asking are two different things :)
[12:20:51] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty easy to listen for change/input events and calculate totalsd.
[12:20:55] <robertmaxrees> *totals
[12:21:25] <regedit> that's why i linked the answer - don't care about the question
[12:21:46] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you're looking for a pub/sub - you can build that on your own.  there are some solutions out there for backbone.
[12:21:53] <robertmaxrees> though really i'd check out the flux pattern.
[12:22:25] <robertmaxrees> specifically the reflux and redux libraries.
[12:22:31] <robertmaxrees> those are a much smarter way to handle this imo.
[12:25:31] <regedit> ok thanks
[12:25:38] <regedit> looks interesting
[12:26:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd personally avoid pub/sub - every time i've used it it's become a mess.
[12:27:10] <regedit> awesome! because the codebase i'm working on here is a hopeless damned-to-hell mess already, so this addition would feel quite welcome into the horrible mix
[12:27:50] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:27:53] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[12:53:55] <quechon> im trying to use ajax but and preventDefault() but from what ive seen if i use that function the post functionality is  lost from my <form>
[12:54:07] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:54:14] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us what you mean?
[12:55:31] <quechon> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/NqyJGvCpklV3w9FcZSg0/
[12:55:40] <quechon> thats my html
[12:56:11] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:56:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:56:15] <robertmaxrees> that's templating,.
[12:56:23] <robertmaxrees> show us the actual rendered html.
[12:57:07] <quechon> what you mean
[12:57:15] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't interact with python.
[12:57:21] <robertmaxrees> your server is spitting out html.
[12:57:24] <robertmaxrees> i care about that html.
[12:57:36] <quechon> ok
[12:59:42] <quechon> you mean this right https://paste.pound-python.org/show/qbFFl2QqS2XCZ3CzbcNT/
[12:59:56] <robertmaxrees> almost.
[13:00:03] <robertmaxrees> i don't care about the {{ url_for('home')}} stiff/
[13:00:15] <robertmaxrees> but close enough.
[13:00:17] <robertmaxrees> what about the JS?
[13:00:29] <quechon> i will translate to /home/
[13:01:40] <quechon> my js isntr complete cuz ive trying different things so i dont think you gonna find anything there
[13:01:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:01:53] <robertmaxrees> you said you're having a problem with your js.
[13:01:59] <robertmaxrees> sooo i'd need to see it to help :)
[13:04:23] <quechon> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/zdmfWjfmgwRhpudyR8DQ/ well this is all  i got
[13:04:33] <robertmaxrees> so what's your question?
[13:04:51] <robertmaxrees> if you use preventDefault() the form no longer posts, right?
[13:05:05] <quechon> tes
[13:05:08] <quechon> yes
[13:05:11] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[13:05:15] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what it does.
[13:05:25] <robertmaxrees> it prevents the default thing from happening.
[13:05:40] <quechon> is there anyway to make it post without refreshing
[13:05:41] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to do an ajax call AND the form post?
[13:05:42] <Arcarc> Quick question: if you add multiple .on() statements to a selector, are they stacked or replaced?
[13:05:44] <quechon> using that form
[13:05:50] <robertmaxrees> quechon that's exactly why you use ajax.
[13:05:56] <robertmaxrees> ajax is how you post without refreshing.
[13:06:03] <robertmaxrees> Arcarc stacked.
[13:06:37] <robertmaxrees> Arcarc let me guess - you're binding multiple listeners?
[13:07:00] <robertmaxrees> maybe because you're ajaxing/writing in new content?
[13:08:59] <Arcarc> robertmaxrees: Good to know! I want to add an event handler to every dynamically created object that has a specific class, except those that already have one
[13:09:12] <robertmaxrees> that's actually the wrong way to do it! haha
[13:09:12] * hlve slaps robertmaxrees with a trout.
[13:09:20] <robertmaxrees> you want a delegated event listener instead.
[13:09:28] <robertmaxrees> check out http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[13:09:35] <robertmaxrees> and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:09:58] <Forbidd3n> When using this the modal content area is not cleared - $('body').on('hidden.bs.modal', '.applicationModal', function () { $(this).removeData('bs.modal'); });
[13:09:58] <Arcarc> robertmaxrees: I had a feeling there was a better way -- thanks, I'll check that out :)
[13:10:01] <robertmaxrees> nbasically, you want $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {}); where "parent" is an ancestor that exists on pageload.
[13:10:15] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n "removeData"?
[13:10:22] <Forbidd3n> when I do $(this).find('.modal-content').empty() it doesn't allow the modal to work again.
[13:10:37] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n gotta fiddle or something?
[13:10:40] <quechon> so if i use ajax i dont need preventDefault
[13:10:41] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I found that online, but know it isn't correct. Hence the reason I am asking
[13:10:54] <robertmaxrees> quechon you do actually.
[13:11:03] <robertmaxrees> quechon otherwise the form will submit normally and the page will reload.
[13:11:13] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: no, there must be a way to clear modal window by default when closing or hiding it
[13:11:16] <robertmaxrees> quechon google around for how to set the data for an ajax submit.
[13:11:28] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n it really depends on what you mean by "clear"
[13:11:47] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n sounds like you need to call .empty() on a particular element.
[13:11:49] <quechon> i know how to i just would like to keep my flask form
[13:11:59] <robertmaxrees> quechon then you're good to go?
[13:12:13] <robertmaxrees> the ajax call is what will allow your form to submit wiothout refreshing the page.
[13:12:19] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I loaded via external url a form. When closed I want to clear all the information within modal-content so when the button is clicked to use the same modal it doesn't first show the old form and then refresh to the new link form
[13:12:25] <robertmaxrees> but you need the preventDefault call as well to stop that from happening.
[13:12:30] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: Yeah, I did that on the modal-content
[13:12:33] <quechon> ok i see
[13:12:35] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n so you want to reset the form?
[13:12:44] <Forbidd3n> no, clear the data in the modal.
[13:12:49] <Forbidd3n> Let me see if I can find an example
[13:12:52] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n then call .empty(0 on the correct element.
[13:12:55] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, make a fiddle.
[13:12:57] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go.
[13:12:58] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[13:51:04] <arup_r> Hi, when I am doing `console.log($inspectionPlaceContainer.find('.inspection-places-list').val());` gives the selected option value as 1. But `$inspectionPlaceContainer.find('.inspection-places-list').is(':selected')` gives me `false`. Any idea why though?
[13:51:29] <arup_r> the 2 similar code contradicts with each other. I expect the later result should be true.
[13:51:46] <taplar> selected !== value
[13:52:01] <taplar> value relates to value=""
[13:52:10] <taplar> selected or checked relates to state
[13:53:29] <arup_r> taplar: ok, but dropdown has a selected value.
[13:54:01] <taplar> uh, afaik dropdowns don't have a checked state
[13:54:07] <taplar> that's for radios and checkboxes
[13:57:19] <arup_r> ok, this $inspectionPlaceContainer.find('.inspection-places-list option').is(':selected') worked.
[14:10:42] <arup_r> How should I use `triggerHandler` function on delegated elements? https://jsfiddle.net/p5htv6t2/2/ here, $(".btnContainer").find('.btn').triggerHandler('click'); doesn't give the alert 1.
[14:11:14] <arup_r> this is a sample example to reproduce my actual problem original codebase.
[14:13:56] <arup_r> I see doc says: "Events triggered with .triggerHandler() do not bubble up the DOM hierarchy; if they are not handled by the target element directly, they do nothing." http://api.jquery.com/triggerhandler/ .. hm.
[14:36:41] <rickymiller> Vangelis: luv ur work
[14:37:24] <rickymiller> Blade Runner soundtrack is :fire:
[14:37:41] <ldlework> true
[14:39:57] <jqueerie> Hello everyone :-)
[14:40:07] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[14:41:48] <jqueerie> I would like to ask about deferred objects. So I have a timing question: Let's say I have a when(effect()).done activity inside a onclick event. That's fine but the effect is only started on clicking. But I would like it to be possible for the effect to be started "before" clicking so then it's available "when" I click. Example would be a json query to another server
[14:42:15] <thealphanerd> Vangelis love your work too. Good catch rickymiller
[14:42:35] <robertmaxrees> jqueerie so you want to be able to subscribe to it being done before it's even been run?
[14:42:53] <Vangelis> :P thealphanerd  :-)
[14:43:26] <Vangelis> I am not the great Composer. :-)
[14:43:43] <Vangelis> we just have the same Name. :-)
[14:44:00] <robertmaxrees> aaaah jqueerie easy.  i see what you want.
[14:44:16] <jqueerie> @robertmaxrees: Kind of! I want a result to be to be pre-ready so when I click, it's already calculated
[14:44:22] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:44:36] <Robdgreat> the @ isn't necessary, FYI
[14:44:43] <jqueerie> I apologize
[14:44:45] <Robdgreat> :)
[14:44:53] <Robdgreat> I need to adjust that highlight
[14:45:41] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/97fa6a6147b7 jqueerie
[14:45:45] <robertmaxrees> that make sense?
[14:47:19] <jqueerie> interesting, but myAjaxCall is only initiated on clicking
[14:47:33] <robertmaxrees> not in that example.
[14:47:49] <jqueerie> hm, then it's exactly what I'm looking for
[14:48:07] <robertmaxrees> var myAjaxCall = $.ajax(); runs the ajax call.
[14:48:32] <robertmaxrees> the myAjaxCall.then() attaches a callback to the deferred that $.ajax() returns.
[14:48:46] <jqueerie> yes, I understand
[14:49:11] <jqueerie> that's great! Thank you very much!
[14:51:47] <jqueerie> that is so powerful
[15:04:12] <Respek> is this the most robust way to test if an input is empty? $.trim($(el).val()).length == 0
[15:04:22] <robertmaxrees> "robust"?
[15:04:34] <Respek> trim to avoid spaces
[15:04:36] <Respek> etc
[15:04:55] <robertmaxrees> well, when doing comparisons almost always do === and not ==
[15:05:03] <Respek> !!value would be the least, would this the be the most?
[15:05:06] <robertmaxrees> but in this case, you can drop that if you're using conditionals.
[15:05:38] <robertmaxrees> $(el).val().trim().length should be fine.
[15:05:38] <Respek> yeah, this'd be a conditional
[15:05:40] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[15:05:44] <Respek> yeah, shrug indeed
[15:05:54] <robertmaxrees> so then yeah - if ($(el).val().trim().length) {}
[15:05:54] <Respek> always like hearing your input robertmaxrees  :)
[15:05:56] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[15:05:57] <Respek> long time no chat :)
[15:06:58] <Respek> thanks as always :)
[15:07:02] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:07:17] <Respek> life still good, you been well?
[15:07:28] <robertmaxrees> life hasn't been good for years hahaha
[15:07:29] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[15:07:31] <robertmaxrees> it is what it is.
[15:07:53] <Respek> :-/
[15:08:37] <Respek> Well if you ever want someone to chat with you can msg me on skype
[15:08:52] <robertmaxrees> hah - i'm good man.  but thanks.
[15:09:14] <Respek> Fair enough, you're welcome. Offer stands if you ever want
[15:09:23] <Respek> till next time internet-friend
[15:12:59] * taplar can't help but sing life is a highway
[15:17:58] <taplar> i was made aware of m.2 ssds today.  cray cray
[15:21:25] <sadtaco> Eh.. I'm using sortable and trying to see, on sort change, what actually changed. When I put something in the beforeStop even and check indices, they're the same as on "stop"...
[15:22:42] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle or something?
[15:23:07] <taplar> heh, is there a 'beforeStart'?
[15:23:40] <sadtaco> There is, taplar
[15:23:51] <sadtaco> And no fiddle, is that not normal then? Hm.
[15:24:21] <taplar> i'd have to look at the api to see when specifically beforeStop fires
[15:24:38] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.  trying to understand the issue :)
[15:24:38] <sadtaco> I'm checking the index of ui.item on "beforeStop", writing to variable in higher scope, then again for a local variable in "stop". Really straight forward.
[15:24:55] <sadtaco> "This event is triggered when sorting stops, but when the placeholder/helper is still available." I guess i'm using the wrong event
[15:25:30] <sadtaco> I should prob be using start
[15:25:39] <taplar> seems more logical
[15:25:46] <robertmaxrees> trying to troubleshoot sorting stuff?
[15:27:53] <taplar> wonder if its a human readable issue, :D
[15:29:18] <robertmaxrees> haha
[15:29:52] <taplar> "why are my numbers sorted out of order?" ....."they are not numbers.  they're strings"
[15:30:00] <taplar> i can't be the only one that's heard that, :)
[15:30:58] <taplar> followed shortly by "fix it!!!"
[15:41:15] <hlve> let's all take a second to wish my pug a happy 9th birthday.
[15:41:45] <taplar> you should just form a party man.  make the commitment
[15:41:57] <hlve> i like how you think.
[15:42:11] <taplar> lol, i wasn't expecting the double meaning with that yoke
[15:43:17] <_genuser_> hello people.
[15:43:26] <hlve> Hi
[15:43:29] <hlve> I'm a people.
[15:43:38] <_genuser_> so look for an item that has two classes assigned would this work?  $(".class1.class2").remove();
[15:43:45] <robertmaxrees> si
[15:43:56] <taplar> hlve: debatable
[15:44:06] <hlve> not nice.
[15:44:12] <taplar> ^_^
[15:44:18] <hlve> _genuser_, it's the same selector as when you access it via CSS
[15:44:30] <hlve> .class1.class2, but it's not a great way to select an el
[15:44:39] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:44:59] <robertmaxrees> why isn't it?
[15:45:03] <hlve> give the 2nd element a unique class and be done with it.
[15:45:08] <hlve> it's ugly.
[15:45:25] <hlve> i guess it works in some situations
[15:45:29] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:45:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:45:30] <taplar> .item.active is ugly?
[15:45:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:45:48] <robertmaxrees> not that bad imo.
[15:45:52] <hlve> true when it's that I guess
[15:45:54] * hlve sighs
[15:45:58] <hlve> JUST USE ACTIVE-ITEM
[15:45:59] <hlve> <_<
[15:45:59] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:46:01] <hlve> gheh
[15:46:17] <hlve> I'm sorry. just trying to pass the rest of this day.
[15:46:35] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[15:47:00] <_genuser_> hlve: guess I've never used any of the css selectors either. :)
[15:47:04] <_genuser_> but it's working so that's good.
[15:47:37] <_genuser_> I just got tired of watching all the Yahoo ads, and I'm throwing all the class/ids into a chrome extension to just delete them from teh document via jquery.
[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:47:54] <hlve> no need to make a chrome extension
[15:48:02] <hlve> just get greasemonkey
[15:48:10] <hlve> tampermonkey on Chrome
[15:48:19] <taplar> tampermonkey is a 'chrome extension'
[15:48:21] <hlve> lets you inject your own JS into pages. No extension need.
[15:48:32] <hlve> Right, you don't need to create another extension
[15:48:36] <hlve> that's what I'm saying
[15:48:37] <hlve> >_>
[15:48:38] <taplar> your making an assumption
[15:48:42] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ if these sites had a paid subscription option, would you use it?
[15:48:49] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: no, I wouldn't.
[15:49:01] <robertmaxrees> so then how should the site make money?
[15:49:11] <hlve> Make a service.
[15:49:15] <hlve> Sell said service.
[15:49:23] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: Yahoo specifically would make money... doing anything that Marissa doesn't think is a good idea.
[15:49:25] <robertmaxrees> as we've seen, that's not realistic.
[15:49:26] <_genuser_> next!
[15:49:33] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ duder
[15:49:35] <robertmaxrees> no need to be rude
[15:49:38] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: ok, joking aside.
[15:49:41] <robertmaxrees> it's a legit question.
[15:49:42] <hlve> and chances are, if there was a paid subscription option, they'd still double dip and add advertisements.
[15:49:42] <_genuser_> nah, that was a joke.
[15:49:58] <robertmaxrees> hlve in some cases.
[15:50:04] <robertmaxrees> sites gotta make money somehow.
[15:50:05] <hlve> that's what channels on cable do.
[15:50:14] <hlve> you pay for a cable subscription. you get commercials.
[15:50:16] <hlve> double. dipping.
[15:50:18] <robertmaxrees> hlve it's also what newspapers do. ffunny how that works out.
[15:50:18] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: joking aside, it's too much. I guess to read one little article - it's an ad stack on teh left, an ad stack on the right. and ad on the bottom of the page.
[15:50:33] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: I guess that's a bit much. I just go to read the news and the comments. when I'm bored.
[15:50:38] <taplar> _genuser_: you ever tried ghostery?
[15:50:46] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ you know that those ads actually help keep some of those newspapers alive, right?
[15:50:59] <_genuser_> hlve: guess I would just use grease/tampermonkey etc. but I still need to write the jquery bit. :)
[15:51:01] <robertmaxrees> i know it's a PITa but that's just how the industry's gone.
[15:51:08] <hlve> True :P
[15:51:16] <hlve> Or if it's just CSS, get Stylish
[15:51:23] <hlve> {display: none !important;}
[15:51:28] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: sure, they do. but an ad stack (3 or more) on teh left, another on teh right, and one at the bottom, that's too much.
[15:51:30] <hlve> I do that on a ton of websites.
[15:51:44] <robertmaxrees> _genuser_ they need the money (shrug)
[15:51:47] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: and since I never click on any of those - they only make money if it's served.
[15:51:49] <robertmaxrees> at least go with css so you don't totally wreck their income.
[15:51:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:52:06] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: so technically once the ad has been served to my unique IP, and my chrome extension removes it, it's a win/win
[15:52:07] <robertmaxrees> heh i worked in the industry so i have a soft spot for 'em.
[15:52:20] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: it's an interesting discussion.
[15:52:24] <robertmaxrees> eh, not necessarily.  depends on what you're removing.
[15:52:27] <_genuser_> do theymake money on views or clicks?
[15:52:31] <robertmaxrees> both.
[15:52:33] <robertmaxrees> depends on the ad.
[15:52:42] <_genuser_> I'm removing just the classes or ID of divs.
[15:52:49] <_genuser_> taplar: I haven't used ghostery. what is it?
[15:52:52] <robertmaxrees> then the ads won't get served.
[15:52:56] <hlve> the ID typically is auto generated for ads
[15:52:57] <hlve> Eh
[15:53:02] <taplar> give it a google, you might like it
[15:53:23] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: no, unfortunately, they do get served. I see them flicker for a second. Basically by the time chrome runs my injected JS, the page has pretty much rendered.
[15:53:44] <robertmaxrees> eh, i could see cases where that would mess with metrics but you've already made up your mind soooo...
[15:53:45] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:53:50] <_genuser_> hlve: I got a bunch of these too: div[id*=\"my-adsMAST\"]
[15:53:56] <_genuser_> in my $() selector
[15:54:32] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: honestly, I'd let Yahoo tell me about the latest body shaming celebrity if I didn't have to watch the ads. But if I absolutely couldn't do away with ads, I'd stop reading Yahoo.
[15:54:48] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: I don't know how google does it so well, but I never mind those ads.
[15:54:53] <robertmaxrees> this is on yahoo's site?
[15:55:00] <robertmaxrees> and the difference is scale
[15:55:06] <_genuser_> guess they don't take over my screen, starts auto paying videos (full volume)., etc. etc.
[15:55:14] <_genuser_> yeah, on the main page.
[15:55:24] <robertmaxrees> google has much more screen real state so they have many more impressions and a higher number of clicks.
[15:55:33] <robertmaxrees> *real estate
[15:55:41] <robertmaxrees> yahoo needs their ads to be much more attention grabbibg.
[15:55:45] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: for example, I do'nt disable youtube ads.
[15:55:56] <_genuser_> somehow they're annoying and I'll click on Skip if it lets me. but I do'nt install adblock.
[15:55:57] <robertmaxrees> see prior statement :)
[15:56:10] <robertmaxrees> google has far more volume to work with,.
[15:56:16] <_genuser_> I guess I'm hearing your experience of having worked in teh industry.
[15:56:22] <_genuser_> it's interesting take.
[15:56:26] <robertmaxrees> and an important one.
[15:56:37] <robertmaxrees> people want free content but don't want to be the product any more like they were with TV.
[15:56:52] <_genuser_> I always thought as the user that I wouldn't have ditched Yahoo mail if I didn't have a Russian Dating service pushed so hard "She's WAITING FOR YOU!!!!!" click herez. plz!!!!
[15:57:09] <robertmaxrees> i've never seen one of those ads on yahoo mail.
[15:57:16] <robertmaxrees> was in there a week or so ago.
[15:57:17] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[15:57:19] <_genuser_> heh, I haven't used Yahoo mail in a loooon gtime.
[15:57:25] <robertmaxrees> heh there we go.
[15:57:29] <_genuser_> so they probably ditched those sometimes after I stopped using.
[15:57:29] <robertmaxrees> i think they backed off on that.
[15:57:35] <_genuser_> yeah, that's good then.
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> so what should those sites do to monetize?
[15:57:54] <_genuser_> I used to find my inbox link on the left 30% of the real estate and the personals ads on teh right 70%
[15:57:57] <_genuser_> heh
[15:58:06] <_genuser_> I do'nt know what they should do.
[15:58:17] <_genuser_> but stackoverflow has ads. never bothered me.
[15:58:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:58:35] <_genuser_> google/youtube (annoying but ok),
[15:58:52] <_genuser_> I never bothered with adblock. becuse I think hey, leave it be.
[15:59:09] <robertmaxrees> doesn't adblock partner with ad companies now anyway?
[15:59:13] <_genuser_> somehow Yahoo gets the attention I suppose because when I'm bored I'm reading all those articles and laughing at the comments.
[15:59:26] <_genuser_> yeah adblock has a "cleanlist" or somethign they call it.
[15:59:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:59:35] <_genuser_> you can whitelist some ad providers.
[15:59:43] <robertmaxrees> they get paid for that.
[16:00:12] <_genuser_> so ghostery is a browser extension that somehow makes money?
[16:00:34] <robertmaxrees> ghostery is a company.
[16:00:41] <robertmaxrees> they happen to offer a free browser extension.
[16:00:55] <_genuser_> right, but I thought the extension is also called the same. heh
[16:01:07] <robertmaxrees> it is
[16:01:10] <_genuser_> so I started off trying to amend the document as it's being rendered.
[16:01:14] <robertmaxrees> the extensiuon doesn't generate revenue.
[16:01:25] <_genuser_> enter mutationobserver.
[16:01:32] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[16:01:40] <robertmaxrees> why not use document ready or window load?
[16:01:43] <_genuser_> and then it all goes crap. somehow can't iterate every single item as it's being added.
[16:01:54] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just use css.
[16:01:55] <taplar> i'm going to make a library that utilizes the mutation observer.  xmenjs
[16:01:55] <_genuser_> documentready is after it's rendered, eh?
[16:01:59] <robertmaxrees> and call it a day.
[16:02:06] <robertmaxrees> document ready is after the initial page is ready.
[16:02:39] <_genuser_> document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', deleteItems, false);
[16:02:48] <_genuser_> that's what I had but it already renders the doc by then.
[16:03:02] <robertmaxrees> why is css not a viable option btw?
[16:03:22] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: because I didn't know about it being a viable option. (not heavy into new web techs).
[16:03:26] <_genuser_> how would that work?
[16:03:37] <robertmaxrees> css isn't new :)
[16:03:43] <_genuser_> provide a css that overrides styles of given elements?
[16:03:57] <robertmaxrees> right.  there are tools that do that.
[16:03:59] <_genuser_> and then inject it into every page?
[16:04:02] <robertmaxrees> you'd just use display: none !important; on those.
[16:04:21] <robertmaxrees> stylebot, stylish, etc.  lots of extensions for it.
[16:04:25] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i leave again.
[16:04:27] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[16:04:30] <_genuser_> display:none it just hides from the view real hierarchy but the element is still there, eh?
[16:04:52] <taplar> it's still in the DOM, yes
[16:05:15] <_genuser_> taplar: heh, I was really hoping to tackle after the document is built, but before rendering starts.
[16:05:34] <_genuser_> so it never even loads. hopefully would speed up page loads especially killing flash ads.
[16:05:48] <taplar> ghostery can help with that
[16:06:01] <taplar> there's also noscript and flashblock(i think)
[16:06:14] <_genuser_> lots of extensions. :)
[16:06:26] <taplar> any time i get a new box or vm i put on ghostery and noscript
[16:06:33] <_genuser_> I figured if I went looking for stuff, I'd find much better optiosn that what I have. but spur of the moment chrome extension writing was pretty fun.
[16:06:33] <taplar> and greasemonkey
[16:07:49] <_genuser_> I wonder if greasemonkey and a custom script deleting tags that are ads should just be it.
[16:07:53] <_genuser_> instead of writing a whole new extension.
[16:08:36] <taplar> most likely.  the thing with ghostery though, iirc, is that it will stop the requests from happening in the first place.  and they have a self maintained list of ads to look out for that are updated
[16:09:02] <_genuser_> probably should just go with that. :)
[16:09:03] <taplar> so it's kinda get it and forget it
[16:09:11] <_genuser_> and focus on my android project.
[16:09:43] <_genuser_> I put project X on hold to build utility Y, and put that on hold to build script Z, and it just goes like that.
[16:33:01] <JonelethIrenicus> when i add new tabs for some reason the dynamically created tabs are all shown together in the content section below
[16:33:08] <JonelethIrenicus> i can't figure out why
[17:08:37] <kurushiyama> It might not strictly speaking the correct channel, but since jqueryvalidation.org seems to be somehow affiliated, I thought I might ask. I would like to validate a bootstrap-combobox, but since that changes the DOM quite a bit, the usual "<Name>":{...} approach does not seem to work. Actually there is a field generated named "<Name>undefined", but validation on this field does not seem to work, either. While I could manually validate the
[17:08:37] <kurushiyama>  field, it seems to be a bit ugly. I'd appreciate any hint.
[18:33:22] <quechon> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/Vs1UcinUwiqciGCuKdr1/ can somebody take a look at this my request is not going through at all
[18:34:36] <taplar> does it show up in your network console?
[18:35:04] <taplar> actually you have a syntax error
[18:35:15] <taplar> you have .done() inside the ajax() call
[18:36:15] <taplar> $.ajax({ ... }).done( ... )
[18:36:25] <quechon> ok
[18:39:01] <quechon> now is working
[19:16:19] <quechon> im trying to loop through a list in the console it renders fine but no in the actual page https://paste.pound-python.org/show/csBrH5X0T7u5NM76QelY/
[21:08:46] <l33n> why are there two "localStorage.chkbx" variables in this script http://devzone.co.in/remember-functionality-signinlogin-form-using-html5-jquery/
[21:09:09] <l33n> dont get this: if (localStorage.chkbx && localStorage.chkbx != '')
[21:13:30] <l33n> o
[22:07:04] <SlizardWizard> lets say i have ('span input').not('div input')
[22:07:45] <SlizardWizard> then my html goes, <div><span><input /><div><input></div></span></div>
[22:08:13] <SlizardWizard> how can i make it so the not only refers to where the intital selector and not any higher up in the DOM
[22:09:27] <arc_> well, you can just do $('span > input') and it will only select direct descendants
[22:10:00] <SlizardWizard> arc_: yeah but my example is very simplified, i can't think of any other conditions to limit it by
[22:10:23] <arc_> okay, then i guess we'd need to see your actual html to really answer you
[22:11:12] <arc_> i mean, you could do $('span input').not('div > input') i guess ...
[22:11:45] <arc_> but if you have control over the html it's probably a lot better to just give whatever you want to select a class or id
[22:12:08] <SlizardWizard> the problem is that the html is recursivly generated
[22:12:20] <SlizardWizard> so its patern matches its parent pretty much exactly
[22:12:38] <arc_> so why can't you use a class
[22:13:14] <SlizardWizard> well everything has a class
[22:13:21] <SlizardWizard> I just can't give it a unique class
[22:14:15] <arc_> why not
[22:14:43] <SlizardWizard> because it is recursivly generated
[22:15:15] <arc_> so you need to select only one of them?
[22:15:33] <SlizardWizard> i am trying to build an example thats explains what i mean
[22:15:35] <arc_> i mean you can still give something a unique class even if it's generated, for sure
[22:16:07] <SlizardWizard> well i can
[22:16:34] <SlizardWizard> but i think it would be easier to make a selector that only selects certain parts
[22:17:57] <arc_> well there is some restriction to the selection that you aren't getting across so i guess we'll just have to wait for the example
[22:21:12] <SlizardWizard> Yeah i am trying to make an example that also explains why i want to do it
[22:21:51] <SlizardWizard> and the example is also very simplified still and doesn't have the same issues that this code will have
[22:28:29] <SlizardWizard> arc_: https://jsfiddle.net/kfvn7fc1/1/
[22:28:42] <SlizardWizard> that is not any of actual code
[22:29:15] <arc_> okay, so what are you actually trying to select
[22:30:13] <arc_> this html is different. there's no span here
[22:31:07] <SlizardWizard> yes
[22:32:15] <SlizardWizard> i used the span as an easy way to explain what i wanted
[22:32:26] <arc_> okay
[22:32:32] <arc_> so what are you actually trying to select out of this
[22:32:42] <SlizardWizard> i want to select only the first name and last name
[22:32:54] <SlizardWizard> but i can't just limit the depth
[22:33:05] <arc_> of all of the forms?
[22:34:42] <SlizardWizard> arc_: i want to give it a div
[22:35:42] <arc_> you want to give what a div
[22:35:57] <SlizardWizard> well i want to give it on of the mulitpliers
[22:36:09] <SlizardWizard> and only select the the direct inputs related to the multiplier
[22:36:20] <SlizardWizard> no child multipliers input
[22:36:38] <arc_> so how can you select an individual .multiplier
[22:37:35] <SlizardWizard> what i am trying to do is to create delete button for the extra buttons
[22:37:59] <SlizardWizard> which all works fine and dandy but i have to go through and re give each input a new name
[22:37:59] <arc_> okay, that's what i needed to know
[22:38:48] <arc_> the way you're doing this is strange. you should separate out the functionality of the two buttons that do different things
[22:39:11] <arc_> have one binding that clones the whole default state, and one binding that adds a new number
[22:39:13] <SlizardWizard> arc_: okay i will go the next level of complicated
[22:39:36] <arc_> lol :  /
[22:39:52] <SlizardWizard> the javascript code i am rewritting is supposed to go along with a php script which can create as many levels of multipliers as you would like
[22:40:34] <SlizardWizard> so a little bit of code like this https://gist.github.com/SlizardWizard/7e0c34d7117c56474c34d737e398ffe5
[22:40:42] <SlizardWizard> will create everything needed for the form
[23:29:02] <SlizardWizard> Pretty much what i need is a selector that works like this
[23:29:21] <SlizardWizard> $(this ' .multiplier > input)
[23:29:40] <SlizardWizard> welp not that
[23:34:23] <SlizardWizard> $(this).find('input).not(this + ' .multiplier > input')
[23:34:29] <SlizardWizard> but i know that wont work
[23:40:52] <SlizardWizard>  I think the best way to describe it is a childrenUntil function
