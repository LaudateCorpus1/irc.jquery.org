[03:46:43] <Deusdeorum> when should i one use $( "#target" ).on( "click", "#target", function() { ... } over $( "#target" ).click(function() { .. }
[04:03:21] <localh0st> Deusdeorum: first example is dynamic call and you should use it always when your element will be created after your DOM will be ready
[04:04:10] <localh0st> second example is static call, and you can use it if your element was in the HTML from the very beggining
[04:05:27] <localh0st> for example if your ajax function will load/create <button> element and it will be added to the page HTML in the time your page is already loaded (dynamically), you should use .on
[04:16:29] <IhrFussel> How to get the LAST 2 characters of a string? I'm receiving a time from a file like "10:15" and I try to plit them into hours and minutes "ighour=newtime.substring(0,2); igmin=newtime.substring(-2);" but when I do document.write(ighour+":"+igmin); I see something like 10:10:15
[04:18:50] <localh0st> igmin=newtime.substring(newtime.length-2, newtime.length); IhrFussel
[04:24:12] <IhrFussel> localh0st, seems to work thanks^^ so JS doesn't support negative length?
[04:30:32] <localh0st> IhrFussel: reads docs...
[04:30:33] <localh0st> https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_substring.asp
[04:31:12] <localh0st> igmin=newtime.substring(newtime.length-2); IhrFussel
[04:31:45] <localh0st> result will be equal to the previous code
[04:41:55] <Duikb00t_> hi
[04:44:34] <momomo> is there an ontouchclick like event?
[04:47:13] <Duikb00t_> When I click one of my items for my accordion it 'jumps' to it whichis good. I am looking for a way that the title is always aligned to the top of the page.
[04:47:16] <Duikb00t_> Is that possible?
[04:47:30] <Duikb00t_> Test url: https://goo.gl/WTXjia
[05:17:17] <localh0st> momomo: what do you mean 'ontouchclick' ?
[05:43:01] <Cork> momomo: you want touch
[05:44:27] <Cork> momomo: some frameworks provide a helper "tap" fake event that fires if touch end fires close to touch start
[06:48:51] <hhee> hey. how can i debug jquery ajax requests?
[07:46:21] <Deusdeorum> why is something like this failing in IE? (non working fiddle just some code) https://jsfiddle.net/e17x1yL4/
[07:46:37] <Deusdeorum> edge, works fine in FF, safari & chrome
[07:53:40] <Cork> Deusdeorum: what is the error you get in ie?
[07:53:57] <Cork> cause that shouldn't cause problem
[07:55:42] <Deusdeorum> Cork exactly, it shouldn't!
[07:56:04] <Deusdeorum> oh wait.. there might be some other html/css if IE :-)
[07:56:08] <Cork> Deusdeorum: it wasn't an assertion, it was that you most likey are looking at the wrong place
[07:56:11] <Cork> ya
[07:56:32] <Cork> ie differs from other browsers in that it REQUIRES that you don't have trailing commas
[07:56:39] <Cork> and it is a common cause for it to crash
[07:56:49] <Deusdeorum> I see! thanks
[07:56:55] <Cork> (and as it crashes when it parses it can't point at the location)
[07:57:25] <Deusdeorum> well, it works partially, the click is on delay, hiding wrong the items but on 'wrong' click.
[07:57:47] <Cork> hiding wrong the items?
[07:58:47] <Deusdeorum> nopes, the right items, but on wrong click, as if value is updated on delay somehow. if click on first item i expect val = 1, nothing happens, if i click on item 2-4 the items are getting hidden
[07:59:41] <Cork> Deusdeorum: ah, that sounds like you bind multiple event handlers or something like that
[08:00:02] <Cork> the fiddle needs to reproduce the problem for me to help though
[08:01:00] <Deusdeorum> Cork yes, i know, i will just troubleshoot a bit harder. I know there's a click function to update value in this survey tool
[08:01:48] <Deusdeorum> thought i avoided it by doing on change instead
[08:15:56] <Duikb00t1> hmmm
[08:16:23] <Duikb00t1> Is it possible to add an offset to a 'slideDown' ? Or is that only possible with 'animate' ?
[08:16:48] <Duikb00t1> NVM FIXED
[08:22:16] <Duikb00t1> Hmm not not fixed lol
[08:23:08] <Duikb00t1> I have a url like blbalabla.com/#panel2   I want it to go to that panel and open it. ( Which works) The only issue is I have a fixed header ( 90px) ;
[08:23:22] <Duikb00t1> How can I add that offset to it? Currently it just jumps to the Anchor
[08:23:41] <Duikb00t1> https://kopy.io/8wVI9
[08:23:55] <Cork> Duikb00t1: you would have to prevent the default scroll effect and then scroll to the element and adjust for the offset
[08:24:26] <Duikb00t1> Ok can you assist me abit by that first thing? :)
[08:24:32] <Duikb00t1> disable default scroll
[08:24:48] <Cork> not right now
[08:24:55] <Duikb00t1> Ok ;)
[09:51:24] <L4yer> Hi guys, anyone got some experience with jquery datatables? I've got exactly the same problem which is described here -> https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/28556/getting-the-second-row-of-headers-in-a-table and cant find any solution. Someone, who can help?
[10:30:20] <ace_me> I need to be able to use validate inside a google api function initMap() { so to be able to use form.validate(rules) but I get map.js:169 Uncaught TypeError: form.validate is not a function
[10:31:02] <taplar> is form a jquery object?
[10:31:49] <ace_me> yes form = $('#iniloc')
[10:31:53] <taplar> k
[10:32:14] <taplar> then that error would seem to suggest it is trying to use validate before it has been included in the page
[10:44:24] <robertparkerx> https://prnt.sc/fg5upc can someone help me learn?
[10:46:35] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[10:47:06] <robertparkerx> taplar, thank you
[10:48:39] <robertparkerx> Okay so it suggests using .find() with ID based selectors. Do I understand that right?
[10:49:45] <taplar> the idea is that you want to encourage situations where jquery will use the underlying operations (getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName)
[10:50:04] <taplar> selectors like "#someId otherstuff" will go through the sizzle engine
[10:50:20] <taplar> where as "#someId" will go to getElementById or querySelector
[10:50:47] <robertparkerx> +1
[10:52:18] <taplar> also if you find yourself doing $(something) over and over, it is better to store it in a variable and reuse it
[10:54:56] <robertparkerx> Is that where it talks about caching?
[10:55:02] <robertparkerx> So the variable is cached...
[10:55:42] <taplar> I would assume so
[10:55:57] <taplar> kinda an odd way to phrase it, but i guess you could call that caching
[10:56:22] <taplar> in any case, it's reused and the system isn't generating the same jquery object repeatedly
[10:56:53] <robertparkerx> thank you taplar :D
[11:06:04] <robertparkerx> taplar, "also if you find yourself doing $(something) over and over, it is better to store it in a variable and reuse it" solved it.
[11:06:26] <taplar> cool
[12:37:06] <bsdnoob> I used $.ajax() to download some page
[12:37:23] <bsdnoob> how can I use selectors to extract info from that page's html ?
[12:38:04] <Violinist> use pliers
[12:38:41] <duch_kazatel> bsdnoob it's just html you're getting back.
[12:39:04] <duch_kazatel> .then(function(data) { $(data).find('h1') });
[12:39:28] <bsdnoob> okay let me try
[13:02:49] <bsdnoob> btw how to I load page just once with $.ajax() ?
[13:03:17] <bsdnoob> it seem to load all the resources of a page
[13:03:42] <bsdnoob> calling method inside success() multiple times?
[13:18:29] <acedia3> It sounds like ajax is updating the $(document) as opposed to a singular element
[13:18:46] <acedia3> if I'm understanding correctly?
[15:41:20] <taplar> today is gonna be a day, that they're gonna throw it bad to you
[16:10:13] <amperry> hi folks, I'm trying to update a date field with some hidden values whenever a certain select option is selected, and it isn't working. Details here, if anyone would like to take a look: https://gist.github.com/amp108/2734eb533ff84173e7df98b1df2ea1d6
[16:10:39] <robertmaxrees> $('input#date_itv_given_' + placement_id).value; looks specious to me.
[16:10:42] <robertmaxrees> you sure that's correct?
[16:10:50] <robertmaxrees> (i skipped the text earlier heh)
[16:10:57] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah I see the confusion.
[16:11:24] <robertmaxrees> to basically, jquery objects don'
[16:11:24] <amperry> robertmaxrees: I'm sure of nothing, sadly.
[16:11:49] <taplar> you are trying to use .value off of a jquery object
[16:11:53] <taplar> is what i'm noticing
[16:12:24] <taplar> also 'tag#id', just use '#id'
[16:13:05] <robertmaxrees> basically, jquery objects don't have native DOM methods and props
[16:14:58] <amperry> robertmaxrees: what do I need to do to locate said props?
[16:15:02] <taplar> have you considered attaching the dates to the options as data fields rather than as hidden elements?
[16:15:57] <taplar> jquery object have wrappers to some specific dom properties, like .value which is val()
[16:16:07] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[16:16:08] <taplar> others that don't have specific wrappers can be accessed with prop()
[16:16:12] <amperry> taplar: I have not. The options need to have the ids; is there a way to attach more than one field?
[16:16:33] <taplar> why does the option need the id?
[16:16:41] <taplar> you are using it to lookup the hidden field, no?
[16:16:46] <amperry> for another function.
[16:16:50] <robertmaxrees> $('#date_itv_given').val(('#date_itv_given_' + placement_id).val())
[16:16:56] <robertmaxrees> but this does seem a little funky.
[16:17:05] <robertmaxrees> there are some other ways to do this that are cleaner, depending.
[16:17:21] <taplar> if all you are using it for is looking up the hidden field, data fields can possibly negate that
[16:17:41] <amperry> I wouldn't doubt it. Some of what would look like bad design decisions are the result of me trying to emulate a pre-existing app.
[16:17:57] <taplar> i'd be interested in seeing this in a fiddle
[16:21:05] <amperry> taplar: I would, but I'm a little coy about it. Partly out of code shame, to be honest, and partly because I don't know what I really have the right to reveal.
[16:21:25] <taplar> no shame man.  it's a teaching room
[16:21:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:22:13] <robertmaxrees> i've got way worse code running in production hahaha
[16:22:55] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6q8k63m7/
[16:23:10] <amperry> I use gist because I'm signed up with github; do you need to sign up or register to do a fiddle?
[16:23:28] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6q8k63m7/2/
[16:23:34] <taplar> nope
[16:23:44] <robertmaxrees> heh, there's an easier way to do this.
[16:24:09] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6q8k63m7/3/
[16:24:21] <taplar> i think that's what you had in your gist essentially
[16:25:33] * taplar will brb
[16:26:44] <robertmaxrees> amperry so you said you're confused about when to use .value vs .val() ?
[16:27:00] <amperry> robertmaxrees: that is one of the things that confuses me, yes.
[16:27:13] <robertmaxrees> so it's actually pretty easy.
[16:27:22] <robertmaxrees> .value is a native DOM method, right?
[16:27:37] <robertmaxrees> err, property.
[16:27:41] * amperry takes robertmaxrees's word for it
[16:27:46] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[16:28:04] <robertmaxrees> basically, that exists as apart of the browser's DOM.  .val() is jquery's accessor for values.
[16:28:21] <robertmaxrees> so if you have a jquery object, you want .val() since .value doesn't exist on jquery objects.
[16:28:45] <robertmaxrees> make more sense now?
[16:28:52] <amperry> ah. (Part of the problem with reading this stuff with ADD is that I'll read a bunch of stuff that looks really, really obvious, only to find later that I've glossed over something because it also *looked* obvious.)
[16:29:17] <robertmaxrees> sure - i have issues with stuff liek that sometimes, too.
[16:29:23] <amperry> robertmaxrees: makes a little more sense.
[16:29:25] <robertmaxrees> all about repitition and pracitcing.
[16:30:05] <amperry> yeah, I just wish I knew what to repeat and practice to get the most benefit of my study time :S
[16:30:12] <robertmaxrees> all of it tbh.
[16:30:12] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:30:15] <taplar> ^
[16:30:20] <robertmaxrees> just keep building.
[16:30:32] <robertmaxrees> staying fresh with even basic stuff is a really good thing.
[16:31:41] <amperry> in any case, for the problem at hand, you're saying I can just replace the lines I had in _matchDate() with $('#date_itv_given').val(('#date_itv_given_' + placement_id).val()) and the same for '#date_itv_for'?
[16:31:49] <robertmaxrees> sort of, yeah.
[16:31:51] <amperry> Or am I missing something else here?
[16:32:02] <robertmaxrees> $('#date_itv_given').val(('#date_itv_given_'
[16:32:02] <robertmaxrees> + placement_id).val())
[16:32:07] <robertmaxrees> that-s missing a $ in there.
[16:32:48] <amperry> after the first .val and the subsequent open paren?
[16:33:39] <amperry> Also, is there a problem with calling $(document).ready() more than once?
[16:34:03] <amperry> Because this page is getting generated dynamically, and other js code is being loaded.
[16:34:11] <robertmaxrees> amperry yes to the former, and not technically to the latter, though it's kind of a code smell.
[16:34:12] <robertmaxrees> depending.
[16:36:17] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6q8k63m7/4/
[16:38:44] <amperry> taplar: that doesn't seem to be working for me. What browser are you using?
[16:39:02] <amperry> Derp. Now I see the commented-out code.
[16:39:06] <taplar> chrome.  that doesn't do anything other than console logs the select value
[16:42:32] <netcrime> Hey. I'm receiving html from backend and I want to append it to <div class="cointainer"> to the position of first element so that already existing elements would go down the page. Can anyone suggest jquery method to do that?
[16:42:47] <taplar> prepend()
[16:46:47] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:47:06] <robertmaxrees> love those one word answers
[16:47:20] <taplar> :)
[16:53:21] <amperry> gentlefolk, I thank you. That works, and my thimbleful of knowledge has been widened a bit.
[16:53:36] <taplar> good deal
[17:51:43] <Mrprocom> How do I deselect input[type=range]? I tried .blur(), but it doesn't seem to work
[17:51:50] <Mrprocom> here is the problem I'm having https://jsfiddle.net/36mn52u8/
[17:52:47] <Mrprocom> because the OK button in the alert box is positioned after the 50 mark in the slider, it continues to alert() indicating that the slider is still being selected
[17:52:58] <Mrprocom> I want the alert box to appear when the slider goes above 50
[17:53:44] <taplar> weird
[17:55:15] <taplar> something about that alert box is causing the mouseup to not be registered it seems
[17:57:53] <taplar> i'd probably suggest using a modal instead of an alert() anyway.  and i question why you have a slider that goes above 49 if you are never letting the users select within that range
[18:01:26] <Mrprocom> taplar: I was actually planning on using modals, but I did that alert() thing as a text
[18:01:34] <Mrprocom> and I'm doing it for a silly joke :P
[18:03:24] <Mrprocom> it works with modals, thanks
[22:28:43] <aro>  is there a way to prevent the browser scrolling to the bottom of the page when i click on a label for a checkbox?
[22:28:57] <aro> https://codepen.io/barrychapman/pen/VWYgbw
[22:29:00] <aro> thats whats happening
