[04:09:39] <jdelers> anyone here using gmap3 plugin
[04:09:50] <jdelers> for googlemap api
[05:26:01] <Prabhat> Hello all
[06:50:51] <joaocastanho> Hi. I want to check for session in another website. I should use jsonp or cors?
[06:50:57] <joaocastanho> I control both of them :)
[06:55:59] <shoky> for an ajax request you should use cors. jsonp is a hack. tho not sure what you mean by 'check for session'
[06:56:18] <Prabhat> Please help me i want to implement language translation feature in corephp website having jquery a
[06:56:18] <Prabhat> How can i do that?
[06:58:44] <joaocastanho> shoky. I want to know if the user is loggedin in the other website
[07:01:05] <shoky> ajax to a different domain should use cors, in any case.  if you have a choice, never use jsonp
[07:02:03] <joaocastanho> why I shouldn't shoky?
[07:04:39] <joaocastanho> security issues?
[07:04:52] <shoky> because jsonp is a hack, using a <script> tag to get your data.  yes, security issues
[07:05:32] <joaocastanho> Okay. So if I enable cors, I should enable it using js?
[07:05:59] <shoky> the server needs to respond with http cors headers
[07:06:18] <shoky> you don't need to do anything special on the js side for cors
[07:06:38] <shoky> need to enable it on the server side
[07:06:44] <joaocastanho> okay
[07:06:58] <joaocastanho> So on the other website I just execute a normal ajax call?
[07:07:01] <Prabhat> Please help me i want to implement language translation feature in corephp website having jquery a
[07:07:02] <Prabhat> How can i do that?
[07:07:48] <Prabhat> Also i need flags on leftside or rightside of language
[07:07:49] <shoky> pretty much.  not really sure tho about your session cookies if they'll be sent along... haven't woken up enough to think about it ;)
[07:08:03] <okiedokie> should I be using $(e.target).find('span'), or $(this).find('span')?   Is e.target always the same as this, and .. is e.target covered in every browser?
[07:09:05] <joaocastanho> shoky No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
[07:09:11] <joaocastanho> But I placed it
[07:09:17] <shoky> okiedokie: e.currentTarget is the same as `this`,  not e.target.
[07:09:51] <shoky> joaocastanho: the server responding to the ajax request is the one that needs to send the cors headers
[07:10:17] <okiedokie> shoky, what's the difference between e.target and e.currentTarget?
[07:10:42] <joaocastanho> Yeah, I did it
[07:11:33] <shoky> okiedokie: e.target is the actual element that the event occured on.  e.currentTarget is the element that the event listener was attached to (can be a parent of e.target, the event bubbles up to it)
[07:12:04] <shoky> joaocastanho: then i guess you didn't do it properly, i dono
[07:12:57] <joaocastanho> which headers are needed?
[07:13:14] <shoky> the one in the error message
[07:13:55] <joaocastanho> I placed on top of the page
[07:14:22] <shoky> ok
[07:14:22] <okiedokie> what's the best 'advanced' jquery tutorial/book? a learn by doing experience
[07:16:56] <joaocastanho> shoky cors.io can I use it?
[07:17:00] <joaocastanho> it's a proxy
[07:17:21] <shoky> why would you need a proxy for your own server :)
[07:17:39] <joaocastanho> I placed to header in the requested server
[07:17:45] <joaocastanho> and still return an error :(
[07:17:49] <shoky> you didn't do it correctly, then
[07:17:54] <shoky> or in the wrong place
[07:18:04] <shoky> not jquery-related, anyways
[07:18:33] <joaocastanho> okay
[07:18:51] <shoky> check out enable-cors.org  or go ask in ##php or whatever server platform you're using
[07:19:25] <joaocastanho> enable-cors for php say to add the header I added, so... something wrong
[07:19:56] <shoky> as for cors proxies, i'll warn you that in my experience they never stay up for long ;)
[07:20:29] <shoky> maybe you added the header after already sending data
[07:20:31] <joaocastanho> ah, so you have used them before :D
[07:20:47] <shoky> i've tried to :)
[07:20:52] <shoky> but not for my own site..
[07:21:05] <joaocastanho> function link() { [native code] }
[07:21:19] <shoky> hm?
[07:21:45] <joaocastanho> ah I was trying to use a pastebin to upload
[07:22:18] <joaocastanho> https://thepb.in/p/g5hxc3XkO594ns6 shoky
[07:22:21] <joaocastanho> that's what I have
[07:23:00] <joaocastanho> no output before that
[07:23:54] <shoky> what type of request are you doing?
[07:23:56] <shoky> get/post?
[07:24:01] <joaocastanho> get
[07:24:20] <joaocastanho> want ajax code?
[07:25:29] <shoky> do you see the request in the browser network tab?  do you see the header
[07:25:55] <joaocastanho> no
[07:25:59] <joaocastanho> and I get this too
[07:26:00] <joaocastanho> Status Code:301 Moved Permanently
[07:26:49] <shoky> mm then the server is responding with a redirect..?
[07:27:03] <joaocastanho> it's not redirecting anywhere
[07:27:07] <joaocastanho> ah maybe it is to www.
[07:27:23] <shoky> check the Location header on that request
[07:27:40] <joaocastanho> no location :P
[07:28:06] <joaocastanho> It's the .htaccess file that I have
[07:28:10] <joaocastanho> I redirect to ww.
[07:28:11] <joaocastanho> www.*
[07:28:16] <joaocastanho> now it's 200
[07:28:20] <joaocastanho> and I have the header
[07:28:32] <shoky> ok
[07:29:09] <shoky> remember to check the network tab when having connection issues ;p
[07:29:49] <joaocastanho> ah session doesnt pass :(
[07:30:18] <shoky> ya, figured you might have an issue with that
[07:30:31] <joaocastanho> damn it
[07:30:51] <joaocastanho> I need a workaround
[07:31:29] <shoky> good luck sir
[07:31:49] <joaocastanho> I'm f** right?
[07:31:51] <joaocastanho> :)
[07:31:59] <shoky> no idea what you're actually trying to do
[07:33:09] <joaocastanho> I have two websites. I have a modal in site A and I get stuff from site B. I want to know if they did the action already in site B so I dont show a modal
[07:34:55] <shoky> how do they do an action in site B?  it's an iframe?
[07:35:06] <joaocastanho> yes
[07:37:06] <shoky> if you control it all, i guess easiest would be to just notify site A from within the iframe that they did the action, and store that info in site A (client side or server side, whatever is needed)
[07:37:19] <shoky> not the cleanest but should work :S
[07:37:58] <joaocastanho> I would need to know user username too
[07:38:33] <joaocastanho> it isn't ip based
[07:38:44] <shoky> pass it?  i donno dude
[07:38:51] <Prabhat> shoky:please help
[07:38:54] <Prabhat> Also i need flags on leftside or rightside of language
[07:39:18] <Prabhat> i want to implement language translation feature in corephp website having jquery a
[07:39:18] <Prabhat> How can i do that?
[07:39:22] <joaocastanho> shoky the action they do is per user
[07:39:52] <shoky> Prabhat: this isn't a php channel, and this is isn't a channel where people just give you full solutions. sorry
[07:40:37] <Prabhat> Ok..Thanks for your response.I want to implement using jquery.Is it possible?
[07:41:06] <shoky> it's possible.. but usually translation stuff is done server-side
[07:41:09] <Prabhat> I have googled but have not get proper result
[07:41:21] <joaocastanho> maybe you haven't searched correctly?
[07:41:26] <shoky> google is not a jquery teacher
[07:41:26] <joaocastanho> keywords are essential
[07:41:58] <joaocastanho> Prabhat: break your problem into parts and start solving it
[07:42:13] <Prabhat> Can you tell me what to search on google? or any other site?
[07:42:19] <shoky> translation means:   change text.   you can use  jquery's  .text() method for it   :|
[07:42:38] <shoky> other than that jquery won't be too much help here :P
[07:42:52] <Prabhat> Google translate works in jquery
[07:43:01] <shoky> i doubt it :)
[07:43:02] <joaocastanho> What you want to do?
[07:43:13] <joaocastanho> shoky have you understand? :P
[07:43:38] <shoky> joaocastanho: no. but you don't neeed to explain more.. we won't get far :)
[07:43:42] <Prabhat> language switcher that can switch language of whole site when i change language
[07:43:57] <shoky> whole site? even pages you're not on right now?
[07:43:57] <joaocastanho> ah well, no problem. Thanks :)
[07:44:19] <joaocastanho> prabhat that would be better with PHP
[07:44:21] <Prabhat> Yes shoky!!!
[07:44:32] <shoky> jquery works only on current page
[07:44:44] <shoky> please go ask elsewhere like in ##php
[07:44:51] <Prabhat> Ok
[07:44:53] <shoky> if you want to change a text of an element with jquery
[07:44:56] <shoky> .text() does it fine
[07:45:11] <shoky> for buttons you can use .on('click'
[07:45:16] <Prabhat> How can i change the whole site language
[07:45:24] <shoky> change all element's text :)
[07:45:25] <joaocastanho> again? :P
[07:45:31] <joaocastanho> xD
[07:49:10] <joaocastanho> shoky, I was thinking. What if I check if they did the action in site B (the one in the modal) and return a message saying done/not_done
[07:49:17] <joaocastanho> I think it would solve it, huh?
[07:49:40] <shoky> no idea, only you know that :)
[07:49:48] <joaocastanho> eheh :)
[07:49:49] <joaocastanho> right
[09:00:37] <fattest> I add 100 elements to my body and a verticle scrollbar appears. But when I remove these items, the scrollbar still stays, until I manually resize the window. How do I hide the scrollbar when I don't need it?
[09:01:46] <fattest> I tried $(window).trigger('resize');, but that didn't do anything
[09:09:06] <decx> i dont believe you
[11:15:19] <chromatin> I placed my <script/> to load jquery at the end of my page to speed page loads, but evidently that prevents me from being able to use jquery in code in the page body. Is there a way to have both?
[11:16:56] <chromatin> I should add that I am trying to register an event with $(“element”) but of course if jquery hasn’t loaded yet one gets the “$ not found"
[11:18:11] <shoky> why not put the code at the end too?
[11:23:05] <chromatin> shoky: Because I’m building pages from templates on server-side and including the jquery in one specific page. I could templatize page-specific jquery code to load in the common footer, but it would be very hacky
[11:24:49] <shoky> anyways no you can't use jquery before it's included
[11:25:18] <chromatin> Sure, I recognize that, but what is the typical solution? I imagine lots of javascript is context specific and can’t be put in a common footer?
[11:25:56] <shoky> sure it can.  <script> location doesn't matter, they have no context of where they are in the html, (except in relation to other scripts)
[11:26:12] <shoky> the typical solution is to include your code after including jquery
[11:26:38] <shoky> and not to have multiple <script>s scattered in your html, there's no reason to do that
[11:27:48] <shoky> anyway for your case... you can just include jquery at the top
[11:30:32] <chromatin> shoky: Thank you; I am rewriting my templates to include page-specific javascript in the footer. It is early enough that I can make it pretty transparent as far as building templates. THanks.
[11:30:57] <shoky> sure
[12:40:27] <idioglossia> hi everyone. I am using jquery mobile 1.4.5 and I get hte error that .pagecontainer is not a function
[12:40:36] <idioglossia> for both a div and $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer

[19:42:24] <arc_> okay, so this point of sale backend i'm working on right now has a checkbox to hide obsolete items from a table
[19:42:39] <arc_> and the way it determines if an item is obsolete or not is not by a class or something easy like that
[19:42:46] <arc_> it has a hidden input with value true or false
[20:11:29] <notchris> arc_: okay...
