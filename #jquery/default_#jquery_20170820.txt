[00:15:08] <victorqueiroz> Hi. Do you think that using underscore before property names (i.e. this._user = 1, this._data, this._enabled) is a bad practice?
[00:17:32] <lemonsparrow> I've been trying to solve this issue.. for some time now.. any help would be appreciated.. in my page... there are lot of elements with same class.. and it has both drag and click event attached to it.. I dont want the click event to be fired on drag... I tried even the most popular solution that is putting .draggable() above .click() but it works only for 1st element with same class.. for rest of all elements with same class..
[00:18:00] <lemonsparrow> http://jsfiddle.net/dAL5v/ this works only for one element.. not for multiple elements with same class name
[02:21:06] <hellyeah> shoky,  i am sorry for that i didnt do with purpose
[04:33:52] <GoSox> Can I bind events and actions to elements that don't exist?
[04:34:29] <GoSox> I want to merge the javascript files from two very similar pages into one big page. which means on each page, there will be a few event bindings with no element to bind to
[04:34:39] <GoSox> but if that causes a silent failure, then thats perfect
[04:38:08] <pavonia> Have you tried? I guess binding handlers to an empty query set will work
[04:41:43] <GoSox> i have not tried. i'm done coding for the night :) just thinking ahead for tomorrow
[04:42:32] <GoSox> i suppose worst case, i can just stick a simple data-type attribute somehwere on both documents and use that for js to determine what to do
[09:31:24] <codecutter> Instead of showing a new window when 'edit' icon is clicked, how do I give it a link? http://www.guriddo.net/demo/guriddojs/edit_add_delete/edit_template/index.html

[09:51:17] <peelomestari> I am trying to run function after ajax request has created #ajaxform. how come my jquery is not firing here: $(document.body).on('onload', '#ajaxform', function() { ... }
[09:58:52] <pavonia> peelomestari: The element probably doesn't exist when the document is loaded
[10:01:07] <peelomestari> pavonia: does the 'onload' refer to document instead of #ajaxform?
[10:03:43] <pavonia> Oh, it's a delegated handler
[11:04:30] <jak2000> hi all, how to display a window(float window) and minimize it? (the user can see when maximize, how to do it?

[12:26:38] <snfgf> hello
[12:27:19] <snfgf> is there a better way to loop throuhg a jQuery collection than, $.each(collection, function(i, v) { v = $(v); ...
[12:27:36] <snfgf> I don't like having to recast the HTML element to a jQuery object
[12:51:07] <shoky> not really, there are other ways but all would involve such wrapping in the loop, because a jquery collection is just a collection of DOM nodes, it's not a collection of jquery objects.
[13:01:36] <printForever> looking for a simple answer to a simple question, google is retarded
[13:01:40] <printForever> so I can't google this
[13:01:40] <printForever> ===-1
[13:01:46] <printForever> what does === -1 means?
[13:02:04] <printForever> === means that the comparison needs to be the SAME TYPE and SAME VALUE
[13:02:08] <printForever> but WTF is -1
[13:02:20] <printForever> and why would anyone put that anywhere?
[13:23:48] <pavonia> "but WTF is -1" O.o
