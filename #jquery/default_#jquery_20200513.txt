[01:10:25] <foamz> hello, can someone tell me the right syntax for using a patch request to clear a key that contains a list of items?
[01:11:29] <Cork> a "patch request"
[01:11:37] <Cork> you mean a http PATCH?
[01:11:40] <Cork> or what?
[01:11:43] <foamz> yes
[01:11:47] <foamz> sorry
[01:11:50] <foamz> new to this
[01:11:54] <Cork> well it depends on the server
[01:12:21] <Cork> so a better place to ask that is the server base support channel
[04:48:15] <jsbegin> Hi, how to get it like the below one in fiddle --> https://jsfiddle.net/csornmo/f8bpshv3/12/
[05:16:16] <jsbegin> solved it :)
[05:50:29] <snake-venom> https://jsfiddle.net/by69zkt5/ i want to get click event in iframe on the class. but seems my script is not working or there is some security in iframe
[05:51:13] <snake-venom> line -  14 in jQuery script
[05:51:58] <Cork> why do you have contents() there? is div actually an iframe or what?
[05:53:02] <Cork> snake-venom: well does the html you provide actally match the structure you have?
[05:53:05] <Cork> cause it doesn't look like it
[05:54:46] <snake-venom> Cork, iframe is generating in this div <div id="SOIDIV_InTheLoop"></div>
[05:55:02] <snake-venom> and its real example with which i am working.. same i am using on website..
[05:59:56] <snake-venom> Cork, what is your question in actual , may be i am not getting..
[06:07:22] <dw1> look in your dev console. maybe some CORS issue
[06:08:57] <dw1> nm i forget everything about iframes
[06:10:34] <dw1> but i think they may be inaccessible if not on same domain
[06:11:45] <dw1> (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
[06:57:18] <snake-venom> Cork, sorry, internet issue, i hope if you posted any suggestion for that iframe onclick issue.
[06:59:02] <Cork> snake-venom: well then your selector is wrong
[06:59:37] <Cork> contents() is meant to be run on the iframe not a parent of the iframe
[06:59:45] <Cork> also you need to run this AFTER the ifram content has loaded
[07:00:02] <Cork> as the click handler will be forgotten or the target not found before that
[07:00:37] <Cork> but what your problem is isn't possible to answer as the structure is missing
[07:02:54] <snake-venom> $('#SOI_InTheLoop') it is the Iframe id and "SOIDIV_InTheLoop'  it is html id, both are different, and with $('#SOI_InTheLoop') my approach to contents();
[07:03:43] <Cork> ugg, well so the html in the top has no meaning what so ever...
[07:03:58] <Cork> well you can't run it on ready anyway
[07:04:06] <Cork> you need to wait for the iframe to load
[07:05:56] <snake-venom> ok..
[07:05:57] <impostord> Hey! Is jqm v1.4.5 dependendant on jquery 2.x?
[07:06:06] <Cork> no
[07:06:26] <impostord> so, upgrading to jquery 3.5 should be fine? cool
[07:06:30] <Cork> 1.10+, 2.x or 3.x is replacable
[07:06:46] <Cork> well jqm might not work with 3
[07:06:53] <Cork> as some methods has been removed in it
[07:07:13] <Cork> simplest way is to use the jquery-migrate and test
[07:07:31] <impostord> thanks
[07:08:16] <impostord> jqm 1.4.5 is also dependant on jquery ui 1.12. is jquery 2.x/3.x also replaceable there?
[07:09:02] <Cork> i've used 3.x with some ui libs, but i think som plugins will cry, so your milage might vary
[07:09:37] <Cork> jquery ui is basically unmaintained so donno what state it is in
[07:10:10] <impostord> I would imagine lots of jqm webapps are in dire need of upgrading their jquery version.
[07:10:27] <Cork> ya
[07:11:08] <Cork> there isn't really a reason to move from 1.x to 2.x or 3.x unless you want so remove the old browser support
[07:11:25] <Cork> 3.x has some better support for promise but that's about it
[07:11:48] <Cork> and 1.x and 2.x is still maintained and patched so...
[07:16:31] <impostord> Cork: there are security vulns in 2.x and 3.x so isnt it worth upgrading?
[07:18:11] <Cork> impostord: if there are security problems in 1.12.4 a 1.12.5 will be released same with 2.2.4 and 3.5.1
[07:18:15] <Cork> they move in sync
[07:18:39] <Cork> so 1.x is not depricated by 2.x or 3.x they are different branches
[07:19:02] <Cork> 1.x supports ie < 9 so if you need that use 1.x else use 2.x
[07:19:24] <Cork> if you are ok with using 2.x you can move to 3.x if you don't have a dependency on the removed functions and get some speed up
[07:19:28] <impostord> aha, so latest 2.x gets security patches? thats 2.2.4 currently
[07:19:33] <Cork> yes
[07:19:51] <Cork> 1.12.4 and 2.2.4 is latest version just like 3.5.1
[07:19:58] <Cork> they aren't depricated by 3.5.1
[07:21:03] <Cork> i suspect that 1.x series are going to be dropped *soon ish* though as there isn't really anyone using ie < 9 anymore
[07:22:21] <impostord> the latest version of jquery ui seems to be 1.12.1
[07:22:32] <Cork> ya, released 3 years ago i think it was
[07:22:38] <Cork> like i said it is unmaintained
[07:23:12] <Cork> there servers goes down from time to time and it takes months for them to come up again
[07:23:38] <Cork> and the issues haven't had a code commit for ages on ages
[07:24:37] <impostord> thank you for the information. it's very helpful
[07:24:37] <Cork> also the last blog post https://blog.jqueryui.com/2017/12/the-future-of-jquery-ui-and-jquery-mobile/
[07:24:53] <Cork> as far as i know nothing has happened in jquery ui since then
[07:25:15] <Cork> (well actually a few months before that even)
[07:27:16] <impostord> looks like even jquery 2.2.4 hhas vulns? https://snyk.io/test/npm/jquery/2.2.4
[07:28:03] <Cork> well thats xss not really anything jquery has ever had in task to protect against
[07:29:09] <Cork> and ya any library that lets you inject html into the page has that voulnerability
[07:29:32] <Cork> (so innerHTML should have it too for example)
[07:32:07] <Cork> impostord: the answer to those are more that you shouldn't ever trust/accept html from pages you don't control
[07:32:18] <Cork> isolate it in iframes or take it as text data
[07:32:30] <Cork> depending on how sensitive it is
[07:32:34] <impostord> true
[07:33:41] <Cork> also csp helps a lot :)
[07:34:46] <impostord> jquery 2.x hasnt had commits since 2016. Are you sure it gets security patches?
[07:36:04] <Cork> i haven't seen a post saying it has stopped at least
[07:37:44] <Cork> vut 2016 sounds a bit long ago...
[07:40:08] <Cork> ah, ya
[07:40:32] <Cork> the jQuery.htmlPrefilter can't be added to 2.x or 1.x as it would actually break expected functionality
[07:40:57] <Cork> that is why 3.5.x don't have an eqvivalent in 2.x or 1.x
[09:57:09] <developer1211> Hi Guys
[09:57:48] <developer1211> How can I target any class in iframe loading from other url?
[09:58:09] <developer1211> https://jsfiddle.net/by69zkt5/
[09:58:34] <developer1211> _janne
[10:00:39] <dw1> have you considered that youre searching the contents before its even loaded
[10:01:28] <dw1> and you may not even be loading it right
[10:01:42] <dw1> wtf is AddEventListners
[10:01:55] <dw1> why dont you start with a basic iframe
[10:01:58] <dw1> not that weird javaload
[10:02:22] <developer1211> dw1 I am trying to search contents when Iframe loaded
[10:04:12] <dw1> i dont get how that works at all
[10:05:20] <dw1> oh
[10:05:24] <dw1> i see you included another js
[10:05:26] <dw1> nm
[10:05:36] <developer1211> dw1 I am checking it here https://jsfiddle.net/by69zkt5/
[10:05:47] <dw1> yeah i got that
[10:06:00] <dw1> anyway
[10:06:06] <developer1211> dw1 yes its loading data from another url
[10:06:29] <dw1> its more of a question for scheduleonce.com
[10:06:45] <dw1> whether their script has a method that runs after embed loads
[10:07:42] <dw1> or i guess you could make a loop that checks if the embed has a </html> or something
[10:07:51] <dw1> indicating its finished
[10:07:54] <developer1211> dw1 may be but I am not sure for this. Do we need to update something in fiddle js
[10:12:24] <developer1211> Can I access iframe loading from other domain or not?
[10:14:04] <dw1> there is so much wrong before even that
[10:14:50] <dw1> inspect the source
[10:15:07] <dw1> there are two tags with id= SOI_InTheLoop
[10:15:10] <dw1> teh div and the iframe itself
[10:15:20] <dw1> so remove the div
[10:15:46] <dw1> idk
[10:16:13] <dw1> then it doesnt work
[10:16:16] <dw1> wtf
[10:16:33] <dw1> why would it duplicate the id
[10:16:55] <developer1211> No id duplicate. separate id for div and iframe
[10:17:12] <developer1211> This is div id "SOIDIV_InTheLoop"
[10:17:39] <developer1211> This is Iframe Id "SOI_InTheLoop"
[10:18:17] <dw1> oh yeah
[10:20:22] <dw1> even with a delay it doesnt seem to find anything setTimeout(()=>{ console.log($('#SOI_InTheLoop').contents().find('body').html()); },8000);
[10:20:29] <dw1> hmm
[10:22:33] <developer1211> dw1 any idea?
[10:28:59] <dw1> well if you remove the .html()
[10:29:03] <dw1> you see an error about not being able to clone it
[10:29:16] <dw1> possible SameOrigin restriction
[10:30:43] <dw1> e.g. https://jsfiddle.net/e3xvg24m/
[10:31:24] <dw1> Uncaught DataCloneError: Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Window': HTMLIFrameElement object could not be cloned.
[10:31:45] <dw1> after the 8s timeout
[10:32:04] <dw1> which is prob why the .html() returns undefined
[10:32:48] <developer1211> dw1 ok. So, we can't access other domain iframe content is that you means?
[10:33:05] <dw1> not sure
[10:33:11] <dw1> it doesnt say SameOrigin problem
[10:34:20] <dw1> maybe its a jsfiddle problem
[10:37:09] <developer1211> Its even not working from domain where this Iframe placed
[10:40:10] <Cork> sub documents dom can't be accessed unless the page you access allow it
[10:40:17] <Cork> it is a security model
[10:40:27] <Cork> the accessing website has no control over this
[10:40:44] <dw1> so you cant steal other people's web sites
[10:40:45] <dw1> i guess
[10:40:54] <dw1> yeah seems not to wor
[10:40:55] <dw1> k
[10:40:58] <Cork> you can't get ex. a users address from facebook
[10:41:32] <Cork> as a page loading another page through iframe, frame or ajax does it as the user
[10:41:52] <Cork> so if they are logged in somewhere and this block wasn't there you could steal the users data
[10:42:02] <Cork> so it is a very important block
[10:42:11] <dw1> oh yeah
[10:42:37] <dw1> XSS
[10:42:43] <Cork> no not cors
[10:42:49] <Cork> opps not xss but cors
[10:43:01] <Cork> cross origin requests
[10:43:14] <Cork> xss is the oposite
[10:43:24] <Cork> then you inject data/script into another origin
[10:43:30] <dw1> well that puts a cork in developer1211's plans
[10:43:37] <dw1> ( ಠ ͜ʖ ಠ)
[10:43:39] <Cork> yup
[10:43:56] <Cork> there are two options you can proxy the request over your own server and have it as a proxy
[10:44:02] <Cork> then you can access the data just fine
[10:44:10] <dw1> load iwth PHP and output from your own site
[10:44:11] <dw1> yeah
[10:44:14] <Cork> but then all access will be as the server not the user
[10:44:40] <Cork> and hence not have the security problem
[10:44:53] <dw1> but also lose functionality
[10:44:56] <dw1> if any
[10:44:58] <Cork> yup
[10:45:16] <Cork> if the target site can be modified it can get support to provide this access
[10:45:38] <Cork> but again it is the target site that gives access, the requesting one can't do anything if it isn't already there
[10:45:55] <dw1> Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[10:45:56] <dw1> maybe
[10:45:59] <Cork> yup
[10:46:13] <dw1> in response header
[10:46:18] <Cork> there are a few other headers
[10:46:29] <Cork> but it is what controls if this works
[10:46:42] <Cork> you want to be careful with using * though
[10:46:49] <developer1211> Thanks
[10:47:01] <Cork> better is to list those domains that are actually allowed to access instead of everyone
[10:47:43] <Cork> unless the site doesn't use localstorage, cookies or sessions
[10:47:53] <Cork> then * should be completely safe
[23:37:25] <errorous> would someone please tell me why I do get console.log twice? http://dpaste.com/0F5DJSS
[23:45:33] <dw1> because you nested a console log in a console log
[23:45:37] <dw1> ?
[23:46:07] <dw1> ( ಠ ͜ʖ ಠ)
