[00:30:23] <snake-venom> Waldkauz, i tried html in input but its creating like a inside the input.
[00:30:36] <snake-venom> if possible can you edit the fiddle ?
[00:30:54] <robertmaxrees> tbh don't use jquery like that :)
[00:31:05] <robertmaxrees> create your three elements separately and append them separately.
[00:33:15] <snake-venom> robertmaxrees, sorry did not get you
[00:34:35] <robertmaxrees> var $verifyLicensing = $('<div id="verify-licensing">'), $verifyLicensingInputWrapper = $('<div class="verify-licensing-input">') etc
[00:34:39] <robertmaxrees> then just use .append() and the like.
[00:38:16] <Waldkauz> snake-venom: From your example and description I don't understand what the problem is
[00:39:17] <robertmaxrees> they likelky want to use the object syntaxt to create a sibling element.
[11:09:36] <coder7of9> what version of jquery is optimal to support the last 3  years of browsers
[11:18:37] <coder7of9> Chrome: (Current - 1) and Current     does this imply it supports version 7 released 2018-10-16
[14:01:45] <robertparkerx> why can't you do this + ' > .flip-card-inner'
[14:14:47] <Waldkauz> Is there more context to that question?
[14:53:41] <robertparkerx> Waldkauz this worked $(this).find('.flip-card-inner').toggleClass('flip');
[14:54:14] <robertparkerx> What I wonder is this, I'm checking window size on load and on resize the will fire a function on each
[14:54:28] <robertparkerx> if I resize larger than 992 px it will fire on or another
[14:54:51] <robertparkerx> if I change the size larger and back smaller it will malfunction and still do the one larger than 992
[14:59:12] <Waldkauz> Can't you use a CSS media query instead an extra class?
[15:06:58] <robertparkerx> I'm performing hover on larger screeen and click on smaller
[15:46:15] <coder7of9> are jquerytols  still in use  last update 2012
[15:46:26] <coder7of9> wsame question jquery ui
[18:02:39] <robertparkerx> I think I figured out my issue using .on() and .off()
[18:02:59] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx can you share your code?
[18:03:26] <robertmaxrees> using off is a code smell generally, so i'm getting there's a better way.
[18:04:36] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees https://url.hashdev.org/1h
[18:04:45] <robertparkerx> it works this way
[18:10:06] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[18:11:13] <robertparkerx> can you explain why robertmaxrees
[18:11:24] <robertmaxrees> dynamically adding/removing event listers is generally a code smell.  doing so in a resize handler is especially bad.  just check the window width in the event handler instead.
[18:11:46] <robertparkerx> I don't understand
[18:11:52] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[18:12:07] <robertparkerx> check window width in the event handler instead
[18:12:35] <robertmaxrees> what about that is confusing? lol
[18:13:22] <robertparkerx> .on('mouseenter', function() { ($(window).width() > 991) { } }); ?
[18:13:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[18:13:35] <robertmaxrees> and then remove that window resize handler.
[18:14:18] <robertmaxrees> you want to avoid resize and scroll event listeners as much as possible - one of the only cases where you're basically guaranteed to cause performance issues.
[18:15:39] <robertmaxrees> so you'd wind up with something like this: https://bpa.st/43LQ
[18:16:07] <robertparkerx> I see
[18:17:56] <robertparkerx> I need to fix something else then too
[18:18:01] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:18:02] <robertparkerx> how could I use .css()
[18:18:08] <robertparkerx> I have a dynamic height set
[18:18:21] <robertmaxrees> you're being way too vague lol
[18:18:22] <robertparkerx> it uses the resize handler
[18:18:26] <robertmaxrees> show code.
[18:19:22] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees https://url.hashdev.org/1i
[18:20:10] <robertmaxrees> you can do this with pure css.
[18:21:05] <robertmaxrees> at least, I'm guessing.  not sure what exactly you're doing here.
[18:29:54] <robertparkerx> I'm using a .scroll() too :(
[18:30:03] <robertmaxrees> what for?
[18:30:07] <robertparkerx> Well at least I'm learning the best way
[18:30:31] <robertparkerx> set a class to a element when it goes past a certain point of screen
[18:30:51] <robertmaxrees> why would you need to add/remove a class to an element the user can't see?
[18:31:09] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm read that wrong.
[18:31:11] <robertparkerx> affix header to the top
[18:31:20] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  that's a legit case.
[18:31:33] <robertmaxrees> just make sure you throttle that call and you're fine.
[18:32:26] <robertparkerx> ty
[19:11:15] <theology> anyone hiring?
[19:14:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:18:51] <robertmaxrees> theology not sure how much luck you're gonna have asking in this channel.
[21:45:35] <robertparkerx> Thanks for showing me that robertmaxrees
[22:34:45] <robertmaxrees> def
