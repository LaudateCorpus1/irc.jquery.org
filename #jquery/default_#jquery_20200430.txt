[09:06:57] <bloober> Hi Everyone I am realtively new in jQuery and I would like to ask you for help. I'am doing my school project and there is one thing I do not understand when I added new content by jQuery to the website it does not work (new content) for a clickable option. The old content that is on the website do work properly, but new would not. I attach jsfiddle link.  https://jsfiddle.net/ujy8sLpf/2/
[09:24:25] <Cork> bloober: for future irc questions, split question and backstory. makes answering the question a lot simpler
[09:25:40] <Cork> bloober: what $().on() does is $() searches the dom for the elements matching the selector, .on then loops that array and adds dom listeners to them
[09:25:58] <Cork> bloober: this means listners will only exist on those elements that existed when the selector ran
[09:26:19] <Cork> the simplest way around this is to use delegated event handlers https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[10:15:12] <destramic> it is possible to drag on mouse click and drop on second mouse click?
[10:15:32] <destramic> damn finger hurts when holding click in :)
[10:15:43] <destramic> but no, serious question...
[11:11:49] <Northwoods> Trying to access element by ID in jquery   -- >var break1_open  = "break1_open@"+d ; break1_open = $("#"+break1_open).val();

[11:12:17] <Northwoods> Something wrong with above statement
[13:04:49] <kittonian> dw1, you around? I got the select list working but it's conflicting with other validations now. Plus, the amount of code I ended up having to cover all 9 images is quite a bit. Perhaps there's a better way? https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/gOaxvzy
[13:06:33] <dw1> you can put a class on the delete and titles and just bind the class to get them all
[13:07:04] <dw1> or a css selector that ignores the number like $('input[id^="post_img"][id$="_title"]')
[13:08:36] <kittonian> well right now the select list is conflicting with the title field. if I select Yes it errors properly and says I need to remove the code from post_main, however when I remove the code it errors telling me I need the code because the title field has data in it
[13:09:05] <dw1> var imgvalidating=true;
[13:09:09] <dw1> should be inside the validation
[13:09:17] <dw1> so its only true after a validation happens
[13:09:47] <dw1> it hsould be false outside
[13:09:49] <dw1> and put it above all the binds
[13:10:03] <dw1> to make it global
[13:10:12] <dw1> when initializing it
[13:11:00] <kittonian> i updated the codepen. do I have it correct?
[13:13:30] <dw1> https://codepen.io/dw1/pen/gOaGOmb
[13:14:07] <dw1> ..updated
[13:14:43] <dw1> and you prob dont need a separate validating var like imgvalidating
[13:14:49] <dw1> because the whole form validates at the same time
[13:14:53] <dw1> prob
[13:15:04] <dw1> you just want to know if it was submitted once
[13:15:07] <dw1> remember
[13:20:02] <kittonian> ok cool. that's working to the point I had it before with a lot less code. very nice
[13:20:47] <kittonian> however, when you have data in the title field and set delete to yes, it asks you to remove the code from post_main, but as soon as you do, it says to put the code in because there is data in the title field
[13:21:42] <kittonian> the delete module I'm writing is going to remove all the data from the db for that image, as well as delete the image from the file system. the user should not have to erase any values in the form, just set the select box to yes
[13:22:20] <dw1> you could set the title value to ('') when delete is changed to yes
[13:22:51] <dw1> & revalidate after the change
[13:23:05] <kittonian> if you do that and the user made a mistake setting that box to yes and sets it back to no, their title will be gone
[13:23:30] <dw1> then change the title check validation
[13:23:46] <dw1> to not return false if delete is yes
[13:24:07] <kittonian> ahh, ok. can you update the pen?
[13:24:55] <dw1>  && $('#post_img'+i+'_delete').val()!='t'
[13:26:33] <kittonian> are we modifying the first else if or adding another one?
[13:29:13] <kittonian> adding another one didn't work
[13:29:26] <dw1> change != add
[13:29:36] <dw1> üòê
[13:30:22] <kittonian> ?
[13:31:24] <kittonian> never mind. I understand
[13:31:26] <kittonian> got it working
[13:31:46] <kittonian> I missed the !='t' part. thought you were saying if it did ='t'
[13:31:53] <kittonian> and that's why it didn't make sense to me
[13:32:56] <kittonian> thank you again. this was a bit of a pain in the ass. didn't think a user would forget to put in the image code when they added an image, or vice versa, but apparently you can never underestimate users.
[13:33:14] <kittonian> really appreciate the assistance. talk soon.
[13:34:33] <dw1> invoice @ $25/hr is $125 USD
[13:34:38] <dw1> jk
[13:42:16] <kittonian> lol
[16:25:17] <netcrash> hello, I would like to know how does jquery grid encrypts it's data , I have a tp link archer c6 and I am trying to read it's traffic statistics. But am having trouble unencrypting the json data returned. Any ideas?
[16:25:29] <netcrash> sugestions
[16:25:30] <netcrash> ...
[16:28:26] <dw1> however the author of the software encrypts it
[16:28:45] <dw1> its not jquery
[16:30:05] <dw1> if it returns json you decode the json then have an object to look at in whatever format the creator provided the data
[17:00:22] <netcrash> Where would one on grid jquery plugin place a CryptoJS code to unencrypt the message , I only receive the data: string and is automatically pulled into grid without doing anything else but the refresh
[17:01:40] <netcrash> getStore is called
