[02:31:33] <arunkumar413> @Carpii, jsplumb is mostly for HTML DOM but i want a library for SVG
[02:32:04] <carpii> to do what with? create SVG on the fly?
[02:32:46] <carpii> your best bet is probably d3.js -- https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery
[05:54:11] <arunkumar413> @carpii d3 doesn't access the inner elements of svg
[06:27:31] <dglambert> morning
[07:31:40] <minikN> Hello. Is it possible in jQuery so select an element by id dynamically based on a variable? To further explain, I have two elements I can select like: $("#next, #tab1"), but the tab I want to select is based on an index variable, which can be 0, 1 or 2. So I'm looking for something like $("#next, #tabINDEX"). Would someone know if that's possible?
[07:33:40] <slax0r> apply standard javascript string concatenation and you're golden...
[08:09:14] <KnightsOfNi> How would you go about to get 10 random rows from a select that takes the 50 rows with the highest score?
[08:09:38] <KnightsOfNi> so first take 50 and then 10 randomly from that 50
[09:58:45] <AwkwardCough> KnightsOfNi: https://jsfiddle.net/6tL8twy3/5/ something like this?
[09:59:34] <KnightsOfNi> AwkwardCough, that was actually meant to go in mysql lol
[09:59:44] <KnightsOfNi> but thanks, yeah that is how it would be in jquery :)
[10:03:11] <pete___> Hey everyone
[10:03:52] <pete___>  I'm currently trying to get a 3D secure form as per the guide on sagePay's docs at http://sagepay2013stg.prod.acquia-sites.com/content/using-3-d-secure
[10:04:02] <pete___> I've got down to step 2 handling the redirection, I'm a little confused because it says to redirect the customers browser page to their issuing bank acsUrl
[10:04:12] <pete___> Here is my paste so far https://dpaste.de/pTyK
[10:04:22] <pete___>  My idea was to create a temporary form with the details in, post that to the acsUrl and then, well I was expecting to get an iframe that updated itself with the information or something
[12:22:19] <arunkumar413> Is there a good wiring/plumbing library for working with SVG elements? I know jsplumb but is good only for HTML dom
[12:26:14] <elit3x> Im looking to build a dynamic form that makes recommendations based on user input...Different parts of the form will show/hide based on previous inputs. Is there anything out there to help me get started with that? I know it can all be done from scratch, but would rather have some help :)
[12:26:34] <elit3x> i want something exactly like https://www.typeform.com , but without a monthly fee :)
[12:36:21] <duch_kazatel> elit3x that's super easy to do yourself.
[12:38:26] <elit3x> duch_kazatel: Im having trouble getting started.... I think i understand all the concepts i need to complete it, i guess i just need to start writing the code =)
[12:38:37] <duch_kazatel> boom! basically.
[12:46:48] <arunkumar413> Elit3x u need to check the value of the input and may have to use the else statement conditions to display the other parts of the form. Example,  if input1 = 0 show field 2. Else   show Field 3 and so on
[12:57:00] <qiller> friends, using post example (jquery official), alert is returning empty array using debug print_r. http://pastebin.com/c1ZbxS9A
[12:59:19] <duch_kazatel> you sure you're returning correctly from your php?
[13:03:54] <qiller> duch_kazatel: yep, have only <?php print_r($_POST); ?>
[13:04:06] <qiller> its return empty array
[13:04:10] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) the jquery part works.
[13:04:54] <elit3x> What @arunkumar413 I will take that approach. Thank you.
[13:05:03] <qiller> duch_kazatel: when i use ajax, only error return alert.
[13:05:38] <duch_kazatel> what's the error?
[13:05:46] <duch_kazatel> also: use console.log()
[13:05:50] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/tLyrbdso/
[13:08:34] <qiller> duch_kazatel: returning-> Array()
[13:08:53] <duch_kazatel> qiller i don't know anything about PHP your js is correct.
[13:08:54] <qiller> console.log(data)
[13:09:56] <qiller> duch_kazatel: can i debug using jquery and return XMLHTTPRequest error?
[13:10:12] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:10:36] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[13:10:55] <duch_kazatel> i mean... why?  why not triple-check the php side of things.  test a normal post.
[13:10:56] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[13:12:11] <qiller> duch_kazatel: using jquery official example, return error http://pastebin.com/nbZHQDBt
[13:12:28] <duch_kazatel> open your network tab.
[13:12:36] <duch_kazatel> look at the request.
[13:12:40] <duch_kazatel> what does it say?
[13:14:05] <duch_kazatel> because https://jsfiddle.net/1sqnfnfu/
[13:14:10] <duch_kazatel> the basis works.
[13:14:11] <duch_kazatel> soooo
[13:17:27] <qiller> duch_kazatel: i'm using .htaccess, hiding .php - maybe causing the error.
[13:17:36] <duch_kazatel> heh
[13:20:27] <qiller> Mod_rewrite causes AJAX requests using a relative URL to fail
[13:20:28] <qiller> \o
[13:20:38] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[13:20:49] <duch_kazatel> sounds like the rewrite was going to the wrong place heh
[13:20:57] <qiller> ty duch_kazatel
[14:04:12] <donguston> anyone got a link to that video where the guy falls off his motorbike, sits on a wall/barrier and then another bike crashes into him?
[14:04:26] <elit3x> Can anyone recomend a plugin that will achieve a similar transition shown on this form? https://www.typeform.com/examples/#Information specifically when you go from question 1, to question 2 how it transitions and fades off the previous and next questions
[14:05:17] <elit3x> ooops just realized thats not a direct link, you have to click one of the examples on the link :(
[14:19:24] <duch_kazatel> elit3x why not use your developer tools and see how they did it?
[14:22:48] <elit3x> duch_kazatel: I am familiar with looking at the HTML markup and Checking console for errors, but thats about it. What area should i be looking at to follow allong with the javascript?
[14:25:19] <taplar> elit3x: what browser are you using?
[14:26:03] <elit3x> taplar: Im using firefox currently. I do use chrome as well though
[14:26:23] <duch_kazatel> it's less about the javascript and more about watching the styles/markup but (shrug)
[14:26:48] <taplar> you can see the scripts in the 'Debugger' tab then if you want to peruse them
[14:26:55] <duch_kazatel> ^
[14:26:59] <duch_kazatel> you can do that.
[14:27:05] <duch_kazatel> lots of choices.
[14:27:48] <taplar> but really something like that shouldn't be hard to make from scratch.
[14:28:17] <SzateX> Hi - i'm trying to implement into: https://kodziarze.tk/nope/in.html this: https://github.com/bqworks/slider-pro - but if you can see, on start the first slide have added unnescecary translate3d (after change slide and come back it works very nice). And i have no idea how to repair it. Could someone help me?
[14:29:56] <elit3x> taplar : Is there a way to highlight the part of the java script that is being called as it happens?
[14:30:10] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[14:30:31] <taplar> not without putting a breakpoint on the start of every method
[14:30:38] <duch_kazatel> ^ pretty much.
[14:30:51] <elit3x> duch_kazatel: I see your point about the styles. I guess thats really what i am after
[14:30:53] <duch_kazatel> elit3x why not approach this by breaking it down into the component parts.
[14:33:38] <duch_kazatel> SzateX so what's the issue?
[14:33:56] <elit3x> duch_kazatel: That will be my approach. I didnt want to reinvent the wheel if possible. My concern is my jquery code is not always pretty + I would like to make sure I am following responsive design best practices.  I hoped if there was something already out there i could ease those concerns
[14:34:29] <duch_kazatel> elit3x bootstrap makes some of that pretty easy.
[14:35:17] <elit3x> duch_kazatel: I am currently using bootstrap so thats a plus ;)
[14:40:53] <SzateX> duch_kazatel: on init - first slide has unnecessary atribute trranslat3d
[14:41:06] <SzateX> when i switch slide and come back everything is ok
[14:42:19] <SzateX> if you don't see at first time - refresh
[14:42:24] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[14:42:58] <duch_kazatel> you mean that sp-layer?
[14:43:00] <duch_kazatel> the first one?
[14:43:05] <duch_kazatel> and why does that matter?
[14:44:06] <SzateX> duch_kazatel: sp-slides has attribute translate3d
[14:44:28] <duch_kazatel> ye
[14:44:30] <duch_kazatel> *yep.
[14:44:35] <duch_kazatel> it always does it looks like.
[14:45:41] <SzateX> i have no idea why in first time it has (translate3d) :-/
[14:45:51] <duch_kazatel> because it's initializing the plugin.
[14:45:53] <duch_kazatel> why does it matter?
[14:47:09] <SzateX> duch_kazatel: i don't think it looks a little ugly when it puts translate3d on y at -29px when should be 0?
[14:47:21] <SzateX> dont you*
[14:47:30] <duch_kazatel> it looks fine to me.
[14:47:34] <duch_kazatel> i don't see a difference...
[14:47:58] <SzateX> it is - at bootom
[14:48:08] <SzateX> bottom*
[14:48:18] <duch_kazatel> let me rephrase :)
[14:48:38] <duch_kazatel> as somebody who's probably never seen these pictures before, I don't notice any problems.
[14:49:18] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.
[14:49:22] <duch_kazatel> different in FF and chrome.
[14:49:25] <duch_kazatel> i see what you're saying now.
[14:49:58] <SzateX> http://imgur.com/a/My7fO - this
[14:50:02] <duch_kazatel> i see it now.
[14:52:08] <duch_kazatel> what happens if you disable autoScaleLayers ?
[14:53:26] <duch_kazatel> errr, reenable or w/e
[14:55:01] <SzateX> duch_kazatel: better :)
[14:55:10] <SzateX> wait i do this on server :)
[14:56:30] <Darmani> Is there a way to create a div for an empty space on a page?
[14:56:41] <duch_kazatel> wut
[14:56:46] <duch_kazatel> xy
[14:56:47] <SzateX> duch_kazatel: look on site :)
[14:57:18] <taplar> Darmani: you can use margins/padding/spacing to create empty space
[14:58:12] <Darmani> taplar: That's what I thought too but I'm not sure how it would be done.
[14:58:23] <Darmani> I know how to give spacing and padding to a div with elements inside...
[14:58:24] <duch_kazatel> Darmani clarify what your problem is.
[14:58:28] <taplar> maybe hitup ##css then
[14:59:13] <Darmani> Well I have this shitty PSD that was gives to me and I need to create a zoom element on a small part of that PSD.
[14:59:33] <taplar> psd?
[14:59:38] <Darmani> So I guess step one is making a div on that part of the PSD.
[14:59:42] <duch_kazatel> photoshop file
[14:59:48] <taplar> ah
[15:00:15] <duch_kazatel> Darmani so what does blank space have to do with making a zoom element?
[15:02:19] <Darmani> I need a div to anchor the zoom element to.
[15:02:45] <duch_kazatel> "blank space" and "div" are two different things (shrug)
[15:03:55] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: sorry hold on.
[15:03:59] <Darmani> Got a phone call -.-
[15:04:05] <duch_kazatel> 'kay?
[15:08:14] <taplar> rude!
[15:13:54] <duch_kazatel> lel
[15:23:31] <Darmani> Ok my bad
[15:23:34] <Darmani> I'm so sorry
[15:23:59] <Darmani> Okay so I gotta figure this out...
[15:24:07] <duch_kazatel> it's fine lol
[15:24:14] <duch_kazatel> but what's there to figure out?
[15:24:20] <duch_kazatel> <div></div> <-- there you go :)
[15:24:26] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: luls
[15:24:30] * taplar was just joking
[15:25:19] <Darmani> taplar: Maybe you were right. Let me see if I can just give it some height and width and some margins to move it into place.
[15:26:00] * taplar sings "You may be right!  *mouth guitar*  I may be crazy!"
[15:26:15] <SideFX> How would I access this element via jquery?: .content_dropdown li:hover ul{
[15:26:30] <duch_kazatel> .content_dropdown li ul
[15:26:34] <taplar> css selectors work as jquery selectors
[15:26:50] <SideFX> What about the hover?
[15:26:52] <duch_kazatel> SideFX though that :hover is gonna be work.
[15:26:54] <duch_kazatel> *weird
[15:27:06] <duch_kazatel> are you meaning to bind an event listener?
[15:27:36] <dni-> taplar lol :D
[15:27:41] <SideFX> Yeah... I have a css set up to display a menu with display:none/display:block, and I'm trying to put a delay in the mouseout
[15:27:55] <dni-> with the mouth guitar :D
[15:27:56] <duch_kazatel> "put a delay in the mouseout"?
[15:28:01] <taplar> :)
[15:28:14] <SideFX> So when you move the mouse off the element the menu doesn't immediately disappear
[15:28:21] <SideFX> waits 2 seconds
[15:28:26] <duch_kazatel> okay - so then just bind the timeout.
[15:28:29] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue?
[15:28:41] <SideFX> Issue is my jquery isn't very good
[15:28:47] <duch_kazatel> the mouse isn't hovering over the element any more so there's no :hover
[15:28:51] <duch_kazatel> you want $(this).
[15:29:00] <taplar> are you going from a menu selection to hovering over child elements?
[15:29:11] <SideFX> taplar yeah
[15:29:18] <taplar> then you need to fix your markup instead, :D
[15:29:21] <duch_kazatel> ^
[15:29:53] <SideFX> I am working on inherited code.  I would have written the whole thing different.
[15:30:04] <taplar> broken windows man
[15:30:15] <duch_kazatel> SideFX can you share an example of what you're working with?
[15:30:21] <duch_kazatel> i feel like there's a missing step here.
[15:30:27] <SideFX> Let me pastebin..
[15:31:14] <duch_kazatel> why not go the next step and make a fiddle? :D
[15:31:29] <SideFX> http://pastebin.com/07mTXbyV
[15:31:35] * taplar *mouth fiddles*  *glances at dni-*
[15:31:39] <SideFX> No jquery yet..
[15:31:56] <duch_kazatel> err.
[15:31:59] <duch_kazatel> this is just CSS.
[15:32:02] <SideFX> i should just get used to using fiddle
[15:32:03] <dni-> yep
[15:32:13] <duch_kazatel> and if you just want to delay the hover stuff, add/remove via js.
[15:32:16] <SideFX> I'm trying to convert that into jquery so I can add a delay
[15:32:42] <duch_kazatel> then yeha, you wnat a mouseenter and a mouseout handler.
[15:32:43] <duch_kazatel> or w/e
[15:32:50] <duch_kazatel> the mouseenter adds a class for those styles.
[15:33:10] <duch_kazatel> mouseout does a timeout that then removes the class when it's done.
[15:34:04] <taplar> i might try to check activeElement as part of the logic
[15:34:26] <dni-> damn
[15:34:33] <dni-> i did exactly this 2-3 dys ago
[15:34:43] <dni-> but i already deleted it :D
[15:34:44] <taplar> as your going to have to handle for mouse leave and mouse enter before the timeout ends
[15:35:17] <duch_kazatel> which can get pretty complex fwiw.
[15:35:24] <duch_kazatel> i'd just fix the markup tbh.
[15:35:30] <taplar> ^^^
[15:35:48] <SideFX> This is a headache :(  They have that 1 class definiting like 15 different things via sub li ul li, stuff, so I'll have to re-write all the css complete.y
[15:36:29] <dni-> hiddenworld.taplar.com
[15:36:33] <SideFX> Using all those selectors seems like a bad practice
[15:36:36] <dni-> :D
[15:36:37] <taplar> great site
[15:36:44] <taplar> dude's a prick though
[15:36:48] <duch_kazatel> SideFX using them where?
[15:36:58] <duch_kazatel> in the css?
[15:37:01] <SideFX> Yeah
[15:37:04] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.
[15:37:07] <duch_kazatel> selectors are quick.
[15:41:19] <Darmani> taplar: Okay so it really was that simple.
[15:41:25] <Darmani> Thanks lol
[15:42:06] <taplar> if i can boast about one thing in life, i know simple
[15:42:32] <taplar> they call me the simple man, and grin.  i guess they like me
[15:44:41] <Darmani> Lol
[15:45:49] <dni-> simple is best
[15:53:09] <alan592> hey is anyone here ? O_o
[15:53:55] <taplar> crap, 'anyone' is already a nick
[15:54:03] <taplar> sup dude
[15:54:10] <alan592> haha funny
[15:54:21] <alan592> great
[15:54:44] <alan592> looking for help actually
[15:55:14] <taplar> ask your q man
[15:56:13] <alan592> I've been trying to get this http://jsfiddle.net/bbLjzspf/205/ to work all day but I can't get around that damn error
[15:56:52] <alan592> went thru a lot of documentation but I still don't understand what's wrong with it
[15:56:55] <sillyslux> that cors thing?
[15:57:52] <alan592> no just try adding a new row you will see...
[15:58:25] <alan592> I debugged my eyes out but I'm a total scrub...
[15:58:31] <taplar> the inputs being full width?
[15:58:49] <taplar> it helps if you tell us what the issue is.  not just "you'll see"
[15:58:49] <alan592> no, try adding a new row it doesn't work
[15:58:52] <alan592> it gives an error
[15:58:54] <sillyslux> DataTables warning: table id=recipientTable - Requested unknown parameter '0' for row 3, column 0. For more information about this error, please see http://datatables.net/tn/4
[15:59:02] <alan592> yeah that
[15:59:09] <Darmani> Has anyone used ElevateZoom before?
[16:00:20] <alan592> the row is being added at line 529
[16:01:20] <duch_kazatel> Darmani some people probably have.  if you have a question - just ask.
[16:02:40] <Darmani> Does it work for div's? The examples used .elevateZoom({}); on an img.
[16:02:48] <Darmani> Mine isn't working on a div so I'm assuming that's the case.
[16:02:54] <duch_kazatel> fiddle?
[16:02:56] <duch_kazatel> or something?
[16:03:06] <Darmani> oh yeah fiddle lol
[16:04:14] <Darmani> hangon.
[16:05:27] <alan592> well if you guys have any idea that would be great, meanwhile I'm gonna keep trying
[16:05:36] <taplar> alan592: add row does not take an object
[16:05:40] <taplar> it takes an array of values
[16:05:57] <alan592> it should take an object
[16:06:01] <taplar> nope
[16:06:03] <alan592> it sais so in the documentation
[16:06:10] <taplar> i just changed it to the array and it worked
[16:06:13] <alan592> https://datatables.net/reference/api/row.add()
[16:06:22] <alan592> wat? O_O
[16:07:13] <taplar> If a data structure is used (i.e. array or object) it must be in the same format as the other data in the table (i.e. if your table uses objects, pass in an object with the same properties here!).
[16:07:21] <taplar> you initialized it what arrays
[16:07:32] <taplar> what/with
[16:07:50] <taplar> pick your poison and stick with it, ;)
[16:09:00] <alan592> can you send a link to the fiddle but with an added  comment where you made changes?
[16:09:11] <Darmani> Alright here it is.
[16:09:11] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/vaa1c3zc/
[16:09:28] <Darmani> oh I forgot to add javascript
[16:09:30] <Darmani> silly me.
[16:10:06] <taplar> alan592: ln 529, change it to use inputDataSet instead of rowDataArray
[16:10:30] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/vaa1c3zc/1/
[16:10:54] <duch_kazatel> missing jquery in there.
[16:11:36] <Darmani> fffffff
[16:11:38] <Darmani> hang on.
[16:11:58] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/vaa1c3zc/2/
[16:12:04] <duch_kazatel> also you can't just link to the github page with the file.
[16:12:12] <duch_kazatel> slow down - opwn your console.
[16:12:20] <sillyslux> haha taplar how did you spot this?
[16:12:36] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: Open my console...?
[16:12:46] <duch_kazatel> in your browser dev tools?
[16:12:50] <duch_kazatel> the one with js errors and stuff?
[16:12:54] <alan592> thanks taplar
[16:13:04] <alan592> now I have to get the edit and delete buttons working
[16:13:07] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: ok...?
[16:13:15] <duch_kazatel> Darmani see the error now?
[16:13:38] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: oh
[16:13:39] <Darmani> yeah
[16:14:08] <duch_kazatel> so https://github.com/elevateweb/elevatezoom/blob/master/jquery.elevatezoom.js is npt a js file.
[16:14:20] <duch_kazatel> that's a page.
[16:14:24] <taplar> sillyslux: i'm used to using arrays with inserting into data tables
[16:14:30] <duch_kazatel> luckily, there's https://rawgit.com/
[16:14:30] <taplar> so the object was weird to me
[16:14:43] <sillyslux> ok :)
[16:14:52] <duch_kazatel> Darmani so now you have https://jsfiddle.net/vaa1c3zc/3/
[16:15:20] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: It looks like you just removed the links
[16:15:39] <sillyslux> awesome!
[16:15:47] <duch_kazatel> Darmani and added a link to the rawgit version of that js file.
[16:15:53] <sillyslux> and i just found out how much i hate verbose code
[16:15:57] <sillyslux> comments
[16:16:00] <taplar> heh
[16:16:06] <sillyslux> and for loops
[16:16:38] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: Where did you add that...?
[16:16:43] <taplar> yeah, when we had some guys come in and propose self documentation, life got a lot easier here
[16:16:50] <duch_kazatel> Darmani the external resources on the left...
[16:17:14] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: oh it has the same link name
[16:17:19] <Darmani> but with the rawgit at the beginning
[16:17:25] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[16:17:32] <Darmani> Ok now what? Lol
[16:17:41] <sillyslux> that at work?
[16:17:44] <duch_kazatel> now you have an actual fiddlke.
[16:17:50] <Darmani> great.
[16:17:50] <duch_kazatel> so what's suppopsed to happen with this?
[16:17:59] <duch_kazatel> and do you have a link to the docs of the plugin?>
[16:18:11] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: yeah hold on.
[16:19:18] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: http://www.elevateweb.co.uk/image-zoom/examples
[16:19:52] <duch_kazatel> how would this work with a div?
[16:20:08] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: Well that's what I've been trying to figure out.
[16:20:11] <Darmani> If it works with a div.
[16:20:18] <duch_kazatel> but why?
[16:20:21] <duch_kazatel> why would it need to be a div?
[16:20:26] <duch_kazatel> why can't it be an image?
[16:20:53] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to place the zoomed part into a div?
[16:20:54] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: Because I'm using a div to grab a specific spot on an image already.
[16:21:08] <duch_kazatel> but there's an image in that div.
[16:21:09] <duch_kazatel> right?
[16:21:29] <Darmani> No
[16:21:34] <taplar> unless he's setting like the background of it or something
[16:21:35] <duch_kazatel> wut
[16:21:45] <duch_kazatel> ^ either way looks like the plugin wants IMG tags.
[16:21:46] <Darmani> You mean the data-zoom-image attr?
[16:21:50] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/elevateweb/elevatezoom#getting-started
[16:21:59] <duch_kazatel> no.  i mean <img> tags.
[16:22:12] <Darmani> okay I guess it does want img tags.
[16:22:21] <Darmani> I wanted to know if it worked with just a div.
[16:22:24] <Darmani> So now I know.
[16:23:02] <taplar> so confused
[16:23:19] <Darmani> taplar: what's so hard to understand lol
[16:23:30] <taplar> how the div relates to the image
[16:23:59] <Darmani> It doesn't. It's just an anchor for the elevateZoom functionality.
[16:24:11] <duch_kazatel> also; that image link in the fiddle is bad.
[16:24:49] <taplar> ah, ok.  think i get it.  so the plugin targets an image and puts the zoom into another <img>.  but you were trying to make the zoom element a <div>
[16:25:03] <Darmani> OH WAIT
[16:25:10] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: that was the only issue.
[16:25:11] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/vaa1c3zc/4/
[16:25:12] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:25:14] <Darmani> So IT DOES WORK WITH A DIV
[16:25:18] <duch_kazatel> gross.
[16:25:30] <Darmani> wat
[16:26:23] <Darmani> We did it gang.
[16:26:26] <Darmani> Gotta celebrate.
[16:26:36] * Darmani opens bottle of champagne
[16:28:14] <taplar> reminds me of an article i read on divitis
[16:31:12] <duch_kazatel> heh
[16:32:32] <MACscr> Suggestions for modifying this code so that it only it only appends to the last occurance of the div with the class .divResize? https://jsfiddle.net/mq3ycb0L/7/. I thought last() would work, but it stills seems to create duplicates
[16:33:53] <Seich> How about:  $(dynamic_div).appendTo('.divResize:last').draggable().resizable();
[16:34:11] <taplar> i've had issues in the past with making the same element draggable and resizable
[16:34:37] <taplar> draggable sets, for some reason, width and height on the element inline which seems to conflict, or did, with resizable
[16:35:24] <MACscr> Seich genius
[16:35:26] <MACscr> thanks
[16:35:41] <Seich> :)
[16:35:46] <Seich> No problem
[16:36:42] <MACscr> im trying to create a very basic editor for some elements that i am constantly having to manually create their widths and positions on a daily basis, so starting off with something simple for POC
[16:37:10] <taplar> fwiw, you don't have to re-wrap dynamic_div.  it's already a jquery object
[16:37:51] <MACscr> oops, didnt notice till now that now all 3 are draggable at the same time instead of individually
[16:37:55] <WhirledPress> taplar, I am so close I can taste it. Here is the latest version. I can't figure out why line 39 is messing up.
[16:39:57] <taplar> MACscr: why are you appending the new resizable to the other resizable?
[16:45:01] <duch_kazatel> heh
[16:45:18] <duch_kazatel> maybe confusing appending with insertafter?
[16:49:18] <MACscr> taplar you are making the assumption i know what i am doing =P
[16:54:35] <MACscr> .insertAfter() did the trick. Thanks!
[16:55:00] <duch_kazatel> MACscr you could also just append to the parent container instead.
[16:57:32] <MACscr> now why is there a big gap after the first one, but not the others when the new ones are added? https://jsfiddle.net/mq3ycb0L/9/
[17:01:01] <MACscr> oh, nvm. I see some other issues i have to fix first
[17:05:03] <MACscr> I forgot that my elements actually have to be positioned absolutely, so what i will probably need to do is see if i can figure out the top position of the previous element and then simply get its top position, then the new element will the previous elements top value, plus its height value plus 20. lol
[17:14:08] <MACscr> sweet, got it https://jsfiddle.net/mq3ycb0L/11/
[17:18:42] <marc__> Does anybody know how or why jQuery converts entities in attributes to actual characters. $(`<div temp="&copy"></div>`).attr('temp') == ©
[17:21:04] <duch_kazatel> it's not jquery.
[17:21:13] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/23hz4ag9/1/
[17:21:15] <duch_kazatel> that's how the DOM works.
[17:22:39] <duch_kazatel> marc__
[17:24:00] * marc__ ain't around: ::activity minimal - autogone:: [message recorder::ON]
[17:26:50] <taplar> marc__
[17:26:55] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[17:26:59] <taplar> marc__
[17:27:02] <taplar> heheh
[17:27:04] <duch_kazatel> this joker
[17:27:33] <taplar> i just imagine like gladus reading that
[17:29:01] <marc__> That's pretty interesting. Thank you!
[17:29:07] <duch_kazatel> welp
[17:30:59] <MACscr> well shoot. doesnt seem to work as well with buttons. doh https://jsfiddle.net/mq3ycb0L/14/
[17:31:20] <duch_kazatel> why not just append to the parent container?
[17:32:00] <duch_kazatel> oh nvm.
[17:32:01] <duch_kazatel> derp
[17:33:32] <taplar> pelement.position(); $(pelement).height();
[17:33:34] <taplar> funky
[17:33:34] <MACscr> the end result is i want to be able to have two buttons that allows me to create resizeable and draggable buttons and inputs
[17:34:01] <MACscr> then be able to save the created DOM to a variable that i eventually push to a db
[17:48:04] <taplar> your going to save mark up to a db?
[17:52:03] <loloz> Jquery $(document).ready(... is firing too early I have also tried $(window).on('load'.. It's happening with chrome, but it's ok with firefox. How should I solve this?
[17:52:16] <duch_kazatel> "firing too early"?
[17:52:38] <duch_kazatel> got some more details?
[17:52:43] <loloz> Yes my page is not fully loaded
[17:52:56] <loloz> Divs are missing and the content of the page
[17:53:07] <duch_kazatel> are you ajaxing those things ion?
[17:53:17] <loloz> Some parts
[17:53:25] <duch_kazatel> are those the ones that are missing?
[17:53:35] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, sounds like you have invalid markup.
[17:53:40] <loloz> No, also other sections are missing
[17:53:58] <duch_kazatel> if doc ready fires before they display then you definitely have some invalid markup at play.
[17:55:08] <loloz> But all content is ok, I say it's firing too early because I need to make scroll after page loading
[17:55:29] <duch_kazatel> wut
[17:56:03] <duch_kazatel> if non-async content isn't there before the doc ready fires, it's not "OK"...
[17:56:20] <loloz> I have only one part with ajax
[17:56:30] <loloz> I will remove now
[17:56:31] <duch_kazatel> so then you have invalid markup.
[17:56:40] <duch_kazatel> document ready should fire only after stuff loads.
[17:56:47] <duch_kazatel> err, rather, renders
[17:57:48] <loloz> I've seen on stackoverflow it's happening to other people, they recommend to use window.load
[17:58:03] <duch_kazatel> those people often have invalid markup.
[17:58:07] <taplar> document ready !== window load
[17:58:10] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[17:58:15] <duch_kazatel> they're two different things.
[17:58:26] <taplar> load is after every thing loads, including images and such
[17:58:38] <duch_kazatel> if document ready fires before the base page has rendered, then you have bad markup.
[17:58:59] <taplar> neither wait for ajax to finish though
[17:59:03] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:59:24] <loloz> Yes the problem is with ajax..
[17:59:31] <duch_kazatel> back way up.
[17:59:48] <loloz> How can I wait till it finishes ?
[17:59:50] <duch_kazatel> you said you had non-async content that wasn't yet on the page by the time doc ready fires.
[18:00:22] <loloz> Yes but major content is loaded with ajax
[18:00:27] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[18:00:30] <taplar> lol
[18:00:37] <duch_kazatel> if that statement is true, then you have invalid markup.
[18:00:43] <taplar> solve your sync issue first
[18:00:47] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^^^^
[18:01:04] <loloz> taplar How?
[18:01:11] <duch_kazatel> validate your markup.
[18:01:35] <loloz> I think my markup is correct but I will double check
[18:01:47] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:01:55] <taplar> first step of debugging.  confirm your assumptions
[18:02:15] <Hello> Hello guys, I have major problem for myself, i believe it would be a matter of seconds to help me https://jsfiddle.net/ys1b9Lwv/1/ . In this version it only adds on checked radio buttons, but does not subtract!
[18:02:41] <taplar> change fires on the element being selected
[18:02:45] <duch_kazatel> ^
[18:03:03] <taplar> you'll have to find the others with the same name and decrement them
[18:03:37] <taplar> err, well that's weird since that var is global
[18:03:46] <taplar> what are you doing?
[18:03:56] <duch_kazatel> sounds like he wants a total of checked boxes.
[18:03:58] <duch_kazatel> non?
[18:04:09] <taplar> yeah, seems like he was a checkbox, not a radio
[18:04:32] <taplar> ohhh, nvm
[18:04:33] <Hello> I have two functions one add values to var tot from checked box the other function (this one) adds for radiobox value to var tot
[18:05:05] <taplar> in that case easiest way would probably not be to modify the value, just recompute it
[18:05:19] <taplar> find all the radios that are selected, sum their values
[18:05:27] <duch_kazatel> ^
[18:05:38] <duch_kazatel> super easy .map().reduce()
[18:07:13] <Hello> hmm, was also thinking about doing a value refresh in the beggining of the function. For the recomputing solution, could you give me some leads?
[18:07:33] <duch_kazatel> we just gave you the solution.
[18:07:38] <duch_kazatel> why not go with that?
[18:07:38] <taplar> duch just did with the map() and reduce() methods
[18:07:46] <Hello> ok, thanks.
[18:08:29] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:08:30] <taplar> though he'd need to get() before reduce, no?
[18:08:37] <duch_kazatel> yeah witjh a jquery mapo
[18:08:51] <taplar> that's bit me before
[18:11:49] <loloz> I've checked my markup it's correct. Problem it with the ajax. How can I set some time until call is finished?
[18:12:03] <duch_kazatel> use the .then()
[18:12:16] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax() gives you a promise.
[18:12:20] <duch_kazatel> easy enough.
[18:12:21] <taplar> i have to ask, are you doing the ajax call inside a doc ready?
[18:12:27] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:12:58] <loloz> taplar lol yes, I see now the problem off that
[18:13:12] <loloz> of*
[18:13:37] <taplar> k, i just had to ask.  cause you were asking about doc ready and load stuff, and then as if off to the side you had this ajax thing, :)
[18:14:26] <Hello> https://jsfiddle.net/ys1b9Lwv/1/  having trouble implementing .map().reduce() method
[18:14:45] <loloz> I wanted to split my page into parts and I have loaded other html files with ajaxs. That is not good idea to do? How should I do otherwise?
[18:14:46] <taplar> i don't see either of those methods in that logic
[18:14:46] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:14:53] <duch_kazatel> Hello show us what you actually tried with that.
[18:14:58] <duch_kazatel> and actuially flesh out the fiddle.
[18:15:02] <duch_kazatel> show us markup and stuff.
[18:15:14] <duch_kazatel> loloz why did you want to do that?
[18:15:24] <taplar> loloz: nothing wrong with that.  you just have to understand how that might affect your flow
[18:16:02] <loloz> Because I didn't wanted to have one large index.html. I have now parts which are more maintainable
[18:16:11] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[18:16:17] <taplar> what is 'large'?
[18:16:20] <duch_kazatel> that's not the onl;y way to do that.
[18:16:20] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:16:27] <duch_kazatel> and many smaller files isn't always a good thing.
[18:16:41] <loloz> duch_kazatel: How would you split your page?
[18:16:53] <duch_kazatel> you can pull things together server-side.
[18:16:54] <loloz> taplar: Enough large for me :D
[18:17:04] <taplar> really, what size are you calling large?
[18:17:11] <duch_kazatel> ^
[18:17:41] <loloz> You mean with server side languages like PHP duch_kazatel ?
[18:17:50] <duch_kazatel> or node.
[18:17:52] <taplar> splitting things up to be modular is one thing.  splitting files up because of size is another thing
[18:17:53] <duch_kazatel> or whatever you want.
[18:18:11] <duch_kazatel> hell apache even has SSIs last i checked.
[18:19:46] <loloz> taplar: It's divided in sections, you can call them modules it's not only because of size
[18:20:13] <taplar> ok.  are sections similar in layout?
[18:20:39] <loloz> Yes they are
[18:20:52] <taplar> have you considered any templating engines for building your markup then?
[18:21:02] <loloz> Like which one?
[18:21:23] <taplar> front end, handlebarjs, mustachejs, react, vuejs
[18:21:29] <taplar> there are others
[18:21:41] <loloz> I'm using free hosting
[18:21:42] <taplar> backend, not sure what backend you are using
[18:21:53] <taplar> those are frontend libraries, hosting isn't an issue
[18:21:55] <Darmani> taplar: duch_kazatel bruhs
[18:21:55] <loloz> it has PHP supported
[18:21:59] <duch_kazatel> then use PHP
[18:22:24] <Darmani> Is it possible to make a modal in jsfiddle?
[18:22:30] <Darmani> I gotta show you what I'm dealing with.
[18:22:46] <duch_kazatel> Darmani yes....
[18:22:46] <taplar> Darmani: sure, though 'modal' is a broad term
[18:22:48] <duch_kazatel> why wouldn't it be?
[18:23:24] <Darmani> Remember that zoom in feature I was working on?
[18:23:30] <Darmani> It's being hidden by a modal -__-
[18:23:49] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:23:52] <taplar> you mean the modal appears on top of it?
[18:24:03] <Darmani> taplar: yeah that's right.
[18:24:09] <taplar> then you need to up the z-index
[18:24:12] <duch_kazatel> ^
[18:24:18] <Darmani> taplar: It's at 999
[18:24:23] <Darmani> Still behind it.
[18:24:24] <duch_kazatel> and/or fix where it's placed in your markup
[18:24:28] * taplar sings can you take me higher
[18:24:31] <duch_kazatel> probably a stancking context issue.
[18:24:35] <Darmani> taplar: Lol
[18:24:35] <duch_kazatel> *stacking
[18:24:50] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: A stacking issue you say?
[18:25:07] <duch_kazatel> z-index stacking
[18:25:18] <duch_kazatel> z-index isn't just about the number.
[18:25:24] <loloz> taplar: Thank you very much. I will see about those. I thought PHP is only way since using mentioned hosting.
[18:25:39] <taplar> nah, you got options bro
[18:25:46] <duch_kazatel> loloz fwiw offloading that work to your browser isn't a necessarily good thing btw.
[18:26:13] <loloz> I know PHP but this is not complex site so I have avoid to using it.
[18:26:27] <duch_kazatel> "i have to avoid using it"
[18:26:28] <duch_kazatel> why?
[18:26:50] <loloz> duch_kazatel: I didn't understand you with offloading thing
[18:27:03] <taplar> shifting the processing from the server to the user
[18:27:13] <duch_kazatel> ^ using ajax to build your pages.
[18:27:30] <loloz> Oh
[18:27:56] <taplar> every request you make to the server encurs time loss with latency and just network time
[18:28:20] <taplar> caching helps, but you'll still hit it up front.  and then the user's machine has to build things, if you do it like that
[18:28:20] <duch_kazatel> also the redraws and stuff that the browser has to do.
[18:29:02] <taplar> we're not saying don't do it.  just be aware
[18:29:22] <duch_kazatel> heh, i am.  unless there's a real reason to, I'd avoid it.
[18:29:48] <loloz> Yes, I've looked at beginning, didn't also liked idea of using ajax for building pages. But it was simple enough and I've said to my self what the heck I will go for it :D
[18:31:34] <taplar> you said this is a simple page.  how simple?
[18:32:21] <taplar> like, is this a blog site or something?
[18:33:29] <loloz> One page site, entirely static data
[18:33:41] <loloz> Yes, something like that..
[18:33:48] <taplar> oh, all static
[18:34:21] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:34:48] <loloz> I'm using bootstrap and jquery for site
[18:35:23] <taplar> i dunno if i'd build it all with php or do frontend templating.  depends on how much duplication there is
[18:35:31] <duch_kazatel> ^
[18:35:37] <duch_kazatel> I wouldn't do any of either.
[18:35:42] <duch_kazatel> just build the page.
[18:36:11] <loloz> One html file?
[18:36:17] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[18:36:19] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[18:36:43] <loloz> Depends how is complex tho
[18:37:05] <duch_kazatel> if it's a single page i would imagine not very.
[18:37:58] <loloz> One page doesn't mean it's simple
[18:38:07] <loloz> It could be angular page
[18:38:09] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:38:14] <taplar> that's not 'static'
[18:38:18] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[18:38:18] <taplar> you said static
[18:38:47] <loloz> My is static, I'm just talking with duch_kazatel
[18:38:47] <duch_kazatel> you're also conflating "single page" with "single page application"
[18:38:59] <taplar> static means the page loads and that's it.  there can be scripts that make things fun and such, but nothing new gets added to the page over time
[18:39:03] <loloz> Yes you are right
[18:39:06] <duch_kazatel> right.
[18:39:20] <duch_kazatel> if it weresn't static, I wouldn't refer to it as a single page.
[18:39:41] <taplar> so which is it?
[18:39:47] <duch_kazatel> it's static.
[18:39:52] <duch_kazatel> he's just trying to make a point
[18:39:56] <taplar> k
[18:40:30] <loloz> lol It's static but things change in life so you can always make "slow" dynamic
[18:40:39] <duch_kazatel> 2 things
[18:40:43] <duch_kazatel> 1: static != slow
[18:40:57] <duch_kazatel> 2: then you need to completely rethink your strategy ;)
[18:41:16] <taplar> i dunno how to even take 'things change in life'
[18:41:22] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:41:44] <taplar> you have a static page.  you update it.  new static page achieved
[18:41:50] <duch_kazatel> ^
[18:42:00] <duch_kazatel> once that solution isn't good enough, do the next iteration.
[18:44:10] <loloz> What are people using for dynamic stuff? Like blogs and other which needs update often, cms-es?
[18:44:22] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[18:44:28] <duch_kazatel> you're not writing html at that point.
[18:44:31] <taplar> i just use ajax/endpoints with databases
[18:44:41] <duch_kazatel> at least, not for the posts
[18:44:53] <duch_kazatel> you could build your own blog engine fairly easily.
[18:45:17] <taplar> i should make a blog site.  that could be fun.  i don't have much to say though
[18:45:17] <duch_kazatel> hell or use a static site gen.
[18:45:32] <loloz> With ajax!
[18:45:45] <duch_kazatel> why ajax though?
[18:45:45] <loloz> ajax demolition of the site*
[18:45:50] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:45:53] <loloz> I'm joking
[18:46:52] <duch_kazatel> heh alright
[18:47:10] <loloz> duch_kazatel: You seem like real professional, how long do you estimate you would need for like complete from scratch site like blog or something that complex?
[18:47:39] <taplar> hardest part is implementing the security
[18:47:42] <taplar> imo
[18:47:53] <duch_kazatel> i'm rusty on building stuff like that, and i dunno that i'd ever make that from scratch
[18:48:27] <loloz> Not really from scratch but using some good frameworks and few templates?
[18:48:51] <duch_kazatel> lol lemme rephrase
[18:49:00] <duch_kazatel> i'd just use an off-the-shelf blogging platform.
[18:49:07] <loloz> taplar: How many time would you need?
[18:49:16] <duch_kazatel> that's a great case of "already been solved"
[18:49:25] <loloz> duch_kazatel: Imagine it's not solved
[18:49:29] <duch_kazatel> uh
[18:49:33] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:49:33] <taplar> time wise?  if i did nothing but worked on that?  maybe a couple days
[18:49:39] <duch_kazatel> this guy
[18:50:01] <duch_kazatel> "gimme a timeframe for this completely un-specced project and pretend it's never been done before"
[18:50:22] <loloz> taplar: Frontend, animations, security, everything in couple of day?
[18:50:29] <taplar> animation?
[18:50:32] <duch_kazatel> theeeeere we go.
[18:50:34] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:50:40] <duch_kazatel> poorly specced
[18:51:00] <loloz> taplar: Yes let's say it has cool button flows, slides and others things
[18:51:14] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:51:15] <taplar> what buttons?  when would it slide?
[18:51:20] <taplar> it's a blog site
[18:51:24] <taplar> you just show posts
[18:51:31] <taplar> as far as the user is concerned
[18:51:50] <duch_kazatel> taplar he means front-to-back, designed, architected, hosted, etc.
[18:51:51] <taplar> security is around if you wanted to make it able for you to roll up and be able to sign in and make a new blog post
[18:51:53] <quechon> duch_kazatel: he has a point lol
[18:52:05] <duch_kazatel> who does?
[18:52:10] <loloz> yes that duch_kazatel
[18:52:21] <taplar> i'm lost
[18:52:23] <duch_kazatel> that REALLY depends.
[18:52:35] <duch_kazatel> taplar it's a MUCH broader question.
[18:52:50] <duch_kazatel> loloz that's basically unanswerable without understanding the scope, designs, etf.
[18:52:52] <taplar> so from scratch he means completely from scratch?
[18:52:53] <duch_kazatel> *etc
[18:53:00] <taplar> no hosting or anything?
[18:53:01] <loloz> Yes, it's hard without specifying a lot of things
[18:53:07] <duch_kazatel> he;'s askign a question you can't really anmswer.
[18:53:47] <taplar> i took it he asked how long it would take me to make one.  not make on how he wanted it to be. :D
[18:53:54] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:54:03] <loloz> :D
[18:54:53] <loloz> But if you use your imagination for backbone of app you could also specify other things
[18:54:57] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[18:54:58] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[18:55:03] <duch_kazatel> becausse that's not the timesuck.
[18:55:09] <duch_kazatel> the timesuck is the look and feel.
[18:56:03] <taplar> heh, the "i dunno what it is i don't like.... but I know that isn't right"
[18:58:51] * taplar cracked himself up with an inappropriate joke
[18:59:55] <taplar> mmm, another minute and i can stop playing with my pipeline.  (that wasn't the joke)
[19:00:17] <taplar> heh, though i like that one
[19:00:38] <taplar> deploy!!
[19:00:43] <taplar> anywho, later
[19:01:56] <quechon> im using handlerbars but it doesnt display the username https://paste.pound-python.org/show/lvScL6P0eyPfdtgrjYLG/
[19:02:19] <quechon> on top of the code is the html
[19:02:49] <quechon> the html part renders fine but no username it comes blank
[19:03:09] <duch_kazatel> is your question about ahndlebars?
[19:03:40] <quechon> yes
[19:04:30] <duch_kazatel> good luck then heh
[19:05:07] <quechon> lol
[19:05:21] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) this isn't a handlebars channel.
[19:05:22] <duch_kazatel> sooo
[19:05:26] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: What were you saying? About z stacking?
[19:06:14] <duch_kazatel> z-index contexts and stuff.
[19:06:22] <duch_kazatel> basically, z-index isn't just abnout the number.
[19:06:30] <duch_kazatel> but about the parent container's z-index
[19:06:31] <Hello> https://jsfiddle.net/ys1b9Lwv/9/ not sure how to use .map().reduce()    , but maybe if it is really easy you can change a bit code here?  I have created a demo which represents my problem in action. Thanks
[19:06:38] <duch_kazatel> #css can tell you more, Darmani
[19:07:00] <duch_kazatel> Hello where are you using map here?
[19:07:06] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: Okayy. Thanks again %%
[19:07:07] <Darmani> ^^
[19:07:11] * Darmani join css
[19:07:21] <Darmani> Lolll
[19:07:24] <Darmani> my bad
[19:07:25] <Hello> not using here yet, wanted  your suggestestion how to implement it here
[19:07:46] <duch_kazatel> Hello so show us what you've tried.
[19:07:51] <duch_kazatel> we don't just... do it for you.
[19:07:58] <duch_kazatel> also: this markup is way invalid.
[19:08:13] <duch_kazatel> can only have li as a direct child of ul.
[19:08:36] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i go.
[19:08:37] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[19:10:45] <Hello> anyone else? I've updated my markup
[19:10:47] <Hello> https://jsfiddle.net/ys1b9Lwv/12/
[19:12:29] <skinux> I need the jquery to catch user modification of input and select menus.
[19:16:50] <Hello> https://jsfiddle.net/ys1b9Lwv/12/  Anyone knows a fix  ?
[22:12:30] <WhirledPress> Hello, did you get that worked out?
