[00:17:02] <negusnegesti> Hello guys!
[00:17:02] <negusnegesti> Unfortunately, my ajax loader doesn't work with the browser MS IE. I already tried this:
[00:17:02] <negusnegesti> $(document).ready(function() {   $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false }); });
[00:17:02] <negusnegesti> Still the same behaviour. The loading gif won't be displayed.
[00:17:02] <negusnegesti> Any ideas? Thank you!
[00:34:14] <Cork> negusnegesti: cache: false is only for adding some random numbers at the end of ajax get urls
[00:34:25] <Cork> negusnegesti: if you have a problem with a gif it is something else
[00:40:30] <krambiorix> hi, how can i unbind this handler? http://jsfiddle.net/hmnb8qvL/
[00:41:43] <Cork> krambiorix: $(document).off('click', '.delete')
[00:41:57] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks!
[00:46:09] <bl4ckdu5t> How do I get the text ofa selected option, not the value attr
[00:46:39] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: $(this).find('option:selected').text()
[00:46:59] <bl4ckdu5t> ok thank you
[00:57:52] <trini7y> i just started jquery recently
[00:58:03] <trini7y> and i want to hide a div
[00:58:13] <trini7y> but the code was not working
[00:58:30] <Justus> hey, I have a number of nested elements with a common attribute (let's call it data-id) containing an identification for this element. These elements can be nested directly (<div data-id="foo"><div data-id="bar"></div></div>) or with normal html elements in between ( (<div data-id="foo"><div><div data-id="bar"></div></div></div>) how would I select only the first set of elements containing a data-id?
[00:59:03] <Cork> ?paste @ Justus
[00:59:03] <b-ot> Justus: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:59:51] <Uhkis> ?demo @ trini7y
[00:59:51] <b-ot> trini7y: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:02:57] <Justus> Cork: Fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/ewkgjpp9/ I am looking for a selector giving me 1, 2, 3 and 4
[01:03:09] <trini7y> b-ot: am about to do that know
[01:03:32] <Cork> trini7y: that's a bot you don't have to comment to him ^^'
[01:04:51] <trini7y> i don't know
[01:05:03] <Cork> Justus: http://jsfiddle.net/ewkgjpp9/1/
[01:05:28] <Cork> or actually
[01:05:39] <joroc> is there a way to prevent deselect of text when you click another element?
[01:05:45] <Cork> $('div[data-id="root"] > div') should work too
[01:05:56] <Cork> joroc: no
[01:06:05] <Justus> Cork: the numbering was only exemplary, as is the html structure, it can be as complicated as the dom model allows or as shallow as for 2 and 4
[01:06:07] <Cork> you would have to clone the element and remove the child elements
[01:06:11] <prohobo> um, i think i'm making a JsonField script
[01:06:17] <prohobo> does anyone want something like that?
[01:06:27] <Cork> Justus: see the line i gave you in the channel
[01:06:30] <joroc> any idea how google is doing it?
[01:06:46] <Cork> joroc: is doing what?
[01:06:49] <Justus> Cork: brb
[01:07:10] <joroc> when you create an email
[01:07:23] <joroc> and you want for example to change the text color
[01:07:36] <prohobo> god, i'd have to write a documentation on this script, but it's looking to be portable enough to release it publicly on git
[01:07:55] <joroc> you open the toolbar to change it and the text stay selected
[01:08:23] <Cork> joroc: many google sites fake a lot of things
[01:08:38] <Cork> so what you see there might not even be a "real" selection
[01:08:44] <MEGAGHZ> hi guys
[01:08:46] <Cork> but just a span with a background color
[01:08:52] <Cork> for example
[01:08:52] <trini7y> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/vdr7o4a4/ can you pls he;p me solve that
[01:09:30] <Cork> trini7y: http://jsfiddle.net/vdr7o4a4/1/
[01:09:52] <Cork> trini7y: for the fiddle you hadn't loaded jquery
[01:09:55] <joroc> true, but not in that case
[01:10:01] <Cork> and you didn't have the ready handler
[01:10:15] <Cork> joroc: selection is os based
[01:10:30] <Cork> and many os don't show selection for an element/window that isn't focused
[01:11:02] <MEGAGHZ> Hi all, quicky one - is there any difference by reloading the page using cmd (crtl) + r OR focus on the address bar and press enter? I have a site that acts different.
[01:11:05] <trini7y> Cork: thanks man
[01:11:06] <joroc> maybe it's because they use a table?
[01:11:34] <Cork> joroc: like i said, they fake most verything they do
[01:11:43] <trini7y> Cork: so if i want to write a jquery code thats how i will activate it?
[01:11:54] <Cork> and no wrapping an element in a table doesn't change the default selection behavior
[01:12:18] <Cork> trini7y: not really
[01:12:38] <Cork> trini7y: the reason it is needed is cause the html has to be parsed before js can access it
[01:12:49] <Cork> the jquery ready wrapper is just to make this easy
[01:12:59] <Cork> you need to do the same thing if it was native js
[01:13:07] <trini7y> ok thanks
[01:13:19] <trini7y> whats native js Cork
[01:13:24] <Cork> O_o
[01:13:35] <Cork> js without a framework == native js
[01:14:02] <trini7y> ok i thought as much
[01:14:18] <Cork> also if you haven't check learn.jquery.com
[01:14:30] <Cork> it will tell you about the basics of what you need to do
[01:15:07] <trini7y> ok there is another question
[01:15:19] <trini7y> actually its not working know
[01:15:52] <trini7y> do you need to download jquery before one can use it
[01:16:06] <Cork> you need to reference it
[01:16:18] <Cork> you can load it from a cdn or from your own site
[01:17:22] <trini7y> pls can you elaborate
[01:17:34] <Cork> uh
[01:17:48] <trini7y> whats cdn
[01:18:58] <Cork> cdn stands for Content Delivery Network
[01:18:59] <trini7y> Cork:
[01:19:18] <Cork> trini7y: and i won't talk you through the basics of setting up a website
[01:19:41] <Cork> you would have to read on of the get started web developer tutorials
[01:20:15] <Cork> just one comment avoid w3schools.com
[01:20:21] <trini7y> ok thanks i am checking on that know
[01:20:22] <Cork> for your own good
[01:20:45] <trini7y> hehehe :-D i know that thier tutorials are stupid right?
[01:20:55] <Cork> its often straight out wrong
[01:21:10] <Cork> bad practices and old solutions
[01:21:43] <trini7y> yeah thats true i noticed that also
[01:22:09] <Cork> opera has a good tutorial, mdn is good too
[01:22:57] <krambiorix> how can i completely destroy a modal?
[01:23:10] <trini7y> can you give me a link to that
[01:23:16] <Cork> krambiorix: context
[01:24:09] <krambiorix> Cork, i use $(div).modal('show'); to show the modal , i want to destroy it
[01:24:26] <Cork> bad opera has removed there sites :/
[01:24:57] <Cork> trini7y: https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Main_Page
[01:24:58] <hellier> finally can get back to working on my saas today :D
[01:25:00] <trini7y> ok what about the later
[01:25:04] <hellier> wrong window
[01:25:12] <trini7y> i use webplatform
[01:25:20] <resting> where can i find the source for $(window).width()?
[01:25:24] <Cork> trini7y: that page is based on operas old site
[01:25:42] <hellier> console.log(window)?
[01:25:43] <Cork> krambiorix: you would have to read the documentation for the plugin you use for that
[01:26:00] <Cork> hellier: the source for?
[01:26:06] <Cork> its just a helper wrapper for the dom
[01:26:34] <hellier> just assumed that was what he wanted
[01:26:47] <trini7y> ok
[01:27:08] <Cork> ah, sorry wrong nick
[01:27:28] <Cork> resting: $(elm).width() is just a helper around the browsers dom
[01:28:21] <krambiorix> Cork, it's just bootstrap modal
[01:28:38] <resting> Cork: i just want to know where is the location of the code when I do $(window).width
[01:28:48] <resting> at least for now
[01:28:52] <krambiorix> Cork, nevermind, thanks!
[01:29:14] <Cork> resting: http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[01:29:19] <Cork> search for: jQuery.each([ "height", "width" ], function( i, name ) {
[01:31:16] <resting> Cork: thanks
[01:31:36] <Cork> though not sure why you would want to know that
[01:39:15] <Macaveli> Is it possible to disable all checkboxes on the entire page on load?
[01:39:24] <Macaveli> without specifying id's or names
[01:39:37] <Cork> $('input[type="checkbox"]').prop('disabled', true)
[01:39:49] <resting> Cork: just trying to see how jquery gets the width..but no luck i guess
[01:40:07] <Cork> ?mdn clientWidth
[01:40:09] <b-ot> Cork: Element.clientWidth - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.clientWidth
[01:40:15] <Cork> opps
[01:40:21] <Cork> this was for window
[01:40:42] <Cork> ?mdn innerWidth
[01:40:43] <b-ot> Cork: Window.innerWidth - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.innerWidth
[01:40:48] <Cork> ?mdn innerHeight

[01:49:52] <Erwat> what is hell?
[01:50:02] <Erwat> is it IE6 development for a webdev?
[01:51:10] <Cork> Erwat: having to produce feature and pixel perfect result in ie4 would be pretty close
[01:51:39] <hellier> IE6 was fucking easy to design for back in the day
[01:52:06] <Cork> hellier: only if you developed mshtml/jscript instead of web standards
[01:52:13] <Erwat> this explains why MS paid $2 billion for minecraft
[01:52:38] <Cork> and ya, if you did it worked ok in ie, but in nothing else
[01:53:38] <hellier> compared to now, when you have chrome android, chrome ios, chrome, firefox, firefox android, firefox ios, ie, safari, safari ios, etc etc
[01:53:41] <Cork> but that was mainly in pre ie < 5.5
[01:54:05] <Cork> after that the world had started to fix the fucked up web standard and ie started to become a problem
[01:54:22] <Cork> hellier: it is easier to develop a working site to day then it was back then
[01:54:34] <Cork> at least if you cut off at ie9
[01:55:20] <hellier> Well you need to be able to test on an array of devices, and the casual developer just doesn't have them
[01:55:41] <Cork> hellier: you mainly need to test on different screen sizes
[01:55:44] <Erwat> Cork: it has always been easy though
[01:55:57] <Cork> but ya, mobile is still not standardized
[01:56:02] <hellier> Well if you're doing complex JS
[01:56:06] <Erwat> just put plaintext inside the <body></body> tags
[01:56:06] <Cork> but desktop is much much easier today
[01:56:08] <Erwat> and you're done
[01:56:17] <Erwat> i mean what else do you need?
[01:56:24] <Erwat> images? why? waste of bandwidth
[01:56:28] <Cork> Erwat: why have a body tag to start with
[01:56:32] <Erwat> idk
[01:56:40] <prohobo> for mad props
[01:57:16] <Cork> Erwat: google push for just sending "<li> list1 <li> list 2 <li> list 3
[01:57:18] <Cork> "
[01:57:23] <Cork> yay for tagsoupe!
[01:57:56] <Cork> (just watch the screen case from google io 2012)
[01:57:57] <Erwat> just use tables
[01:57:58] <Erwat> jeez
[01:58:07] <Cork> Erwat: na, then you have to close tabs
[01:58:27] <Erwat> <brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[01:59:57] <Cork> it scares me that ppl still generate websites like this: http://jsbin.com/lafamekoqe/1
[02:01:33] <Erwat> i recently used a <br /> tag for placement
[02:02:00] <Cork> ya, it isn't great, but far from as bad as tagsoupe
[02:02:24] <Erwat> i just needed it once
[02:02:25] <Cork> i barely remember how you write it to be honest
[02:02:30] <Erwat> i had 2 minutes to place an element properly
[02:02:41] <Erwat> and that placed it exactly where i wanted it to go
[02:03:10] <Erwat> obviously removed it after the build was done and sent
[02:04:23] <Cork> Erwat: i think we talk about two different things, have a look at the code here: http://jsbin.com/duledoqulu/1/edit
[02:04:49] <hellier> You don't ever need to close a br tag so the / isn't required
[02:04:51] <hellier> <br>
[02:04:54] <hellier> that'll do pig
[02:05:13] <Cork> hellier: <br> is actually the correct form
[02:05:25] <Cork> <br /> is html that NOoNE uses
[02:05:47] <hellier> I see tags with the slash at the end all the time
[02:05:51] <hellier> <input /> for example
[02:06:07] <hellier> meta tags as well
[02:06:07] <Cork> sure cause it become popular when xhtml was pushed for
[02:06:19] <Cork> but xhtml was basically never used
[02:06:23] <hellier> people still do it
[02:06:34] <Cork> and error correction takes care of correcting it to the <br> <meta> form
[02:06:34] <Uhkis> xhtml never used?!
[02:06:42] <Erwat> i don't remember whether i did <br> or <br />
[02:06:53] <Cork> Uhkis: i think the use rate is like less then 2% on the web
[02:07:02] <Uhkis> every site was xhtml from like 2006 to 2010
[02:07:06] <Erwat> Cork: yeah we were talking about different things but i understood what you meant
[02:07:19] <Cork> Uhkis: no every site used broken html with a xhtml doctype
[02:07:35] <Uhkis> Cork: well mine was always valid!
[02:07:41] <hellier> okay first site I'm on, stackoverflow, they do:
[02:07:41] <hellier>     <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary">
[02:07:41] <hellier>     <meta name="twitter:domain" content="stackoverflow.com"/>
[02:07:43] <Cork> Uhkis: xhtml DEMANDS that you have application/xhtml+xml as the content-type
[02:07:45] <hellier> lol make ya mind up :P
[02:07:51] <Cork> if you don't your just sending broken html
[02:08:17] <Cork> but 99% of the web developers never noticed this part
[02:08:38] <Cork> and that ie < 10 doesn't support xhtml doesn't really help :)
[02:08:42] <negusnegesti> Thanks  Cork! My image is displayed in mozilla firefox... any experience with it under MS IE?
[02:09:00] <Cork> negusnegesti: huh?
[02:09:01] <Uhkis> Cork: did not know that
[02:09:35] <Cork> Uhkis: there is a lovely mailthread when the lead developer of the time asked in w3c how he should sniff for the xhtml doctype so he could handle it as xhtml
[02:09:45] <Cork> Uhkis: and got the lovely answer "you don't"
[02:10:06] <Cork> and that is basically where xhtml died and html(5) was started
[02:10:27] <Cork> or rather where whatwg was started
[02:10:52] <Cork> uh the "lead mozilla firefox developer at the time"
[02:11:01] <Cork> forgot half the sentence...
[02:11:13] <Erwat> whatwg?
[02:11:16] <Erwat> whatweget?
[02:11:21] <Cork> ?g whatwg
[02:11:22] <b-ot> Cork: Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group → https://whatwg.org/
[02:11:36] <Erwat> same thing
[02:11:39] <Cork> the group responsible for todays html standard
[02:11:51] <Cork> the "html living standard"
[02:12:00] <Erwat> the one that keeps on giving
[02:12:05] <Cork> ya
[02:12:21] <negusnegesti> Referring to your last post: (09:34:23) Cork: negusnegesti: if you have a problem with a gif it is something else
[02:12:22] <Cork> w3c is basically ignored by all web developers now days
[02:12:28] <prohobo> their website sucks
[02:12:32] <Cork> *web browser developers
[02:12:39] <negusnegesti> it was about the gif loader in MS IE
[02:12:47] <prohobo> really Cork? why
[02:12:57] <Erwat> Cork: i don't think this one is: http://www(dot)w3schools(dot)com/
[02:13:11] <prohobo> yeah thats what i was thinking
[02:13:13] <Cork> prohobo: its a bickering name calling mess that doesn't get anything done
[02:13:20] <Erwat> how they manage to get so high up in search is nuts
[02:13:33] <Cork> they produce standard specs that is full of errors and refuses to correct the errors
[02:15:01] <Cork> Erwat: that page has nothing to do with w3c or the like at all
[02:15:13] <Cork> that is one of the big problem with it
[02:15:18] <Erwat> i know
[02:15:21] <Cork> ppl think it is "official" somehow
[02:15:23] <Erwat> but it pretents to be associated
[02:15:28] <Cork> ya
[02:15:45] <Erwat> and because it ranks always so highly in search results i'm sure some people do care and see w3c as more important too!
[02:17:03] <Cork> ya
[02:17:17] <Cork> w3schools is a big problem
[02:17:30] <Cork> luckelly the word is getting out there
[02:17:38] <trini7y> Cork: can you send me the link to that code again
[02:17:44] <Cork> and i see more and more ppl that knows about the problem before i say so
[02:18:01] <Cork> trini7y: you would have to look in your scroll back
[02:18:51] <trini7y> i logged out and logged in again
[02:20:38] <Cork> check the topic
[02:22:00] <trini7y> i m seeing the topic but nothin
[02:22:24] <Cork> Channel logged @ http://irc.jquery.com <--
[02:25:24] <Caroga> hi all!
[02:25:35] <trini7y> this was the channel and you answered the question
[02:25:40] <trini7y> i asked
[02:27:06] <Erwat> hey Cork do you think it would be possible to develop a forum type website that would work by zooming in and out? kind of like google maps
[02:27:16] <Caroga> I need to transform a input's value and then set it back to the same input. I know I can get AND set the value using the following: $('#color-1').val();  But how do I get the current value, set it, without using another selector ?
[02:27:34] <Cork> Erwat: would most likely be annoying to navigate
[02:28:02] <Cork> Caroga: just store the value from the $('#color-1')
[02:28:11] <Cork> and use that variable with .val()
[02:29:53] <Caroga> Cork isn't there another way to chain it or something? Not that I do not want to use the suggested method, but I would like to avoid having to set a var just for something simple like this.
[02:30:27] <Cork> Caroga: as .val() returns the current value of the input
[02:30:31] <Cork> and not a jquery object
[02:30:35] <Cork> you can't chain it
[02:31:24] <encod3> Is it possible to add content in the <head> using TAL? I'm trying to add facebook metatags
[02:31:33] <Caroga> and something like $('#color-1').val( transformationMagic( this.val )); Cork ?
[02:31:59] <Cork> encod3: you can add meta tags, but it is usually pointless
[02:32:19] <Cork> encod3: as meta tags is for indexers and those often don't run js
[02:32:20] <Caroga> I know that 'this' wont work, it's just pseudo code
[02:32:49] <Cork> Caroga: that line would set the return value from transformMagic to the input field
[02:32:53] <Cork> not handle changes
[02:33:02] <Cork> Caroga: val() is an update function not an event
[02:33:04] <Caroga> Cork that's what I want.
[02:33:17] <Caroga> Some background info:
[02:33:26] <Cork> transformMagic($('#color-1')) then
[02:33:35] <encod3> Cork: thanks. But how can I share an image? Facebook documentation says that I need to add a meta property og:
[02:33:46] <Cork> then you can just do arg1.val(arg1.val() /* eith the change */);
[02:34:06] <Cork> Caroga: not sure why you're so scared about variables though
[02:34:10] <Cork> they are just names
[02:34:25] <Cork> the extra data is already created to support chaining
[02:34:46] <Cork> encod3: i don't know much about facebook
[02:34:50] <Cork> i wasy FAR away from it
[02:34:58] <Caroga> Cork, not scared, I just wanted to know if there isn't something better to do with the help of jQuery, I am no pro with it.
[02:35:07] <Cork> but <meta> tags is pointless to generate in js
[02:35:22] <Cork> Caroga: you could move the code into a function
[02:35:30] <Caroga> Already on it:)
[02:35:40] <Cork> but that will be heavier and if this is all you want to do, most likely overkill
[02:36:09] <Caroga> Cork, i need to update atleast 3 input fields, so codewise I like the usage of a method for it.
[02:36:11] <Caroga> function*
[02:37:06] <Caroga> Cork, I use html5 color picker which only handles HEX values, I have a function to convert that back to RGB since that's what my system expects to get.
[02:37:20] <Caroga> So that's why I needed to have a transformation function
[02:37:31] <Cork> Caroga: uh
[02:37:41] <Cork> Caroga: sounds like what you should do is add a hidden field
[02:37:47] <Cork> and just set its value on input
[02:38:53] <Cork> $('#display').on('input', function() { $('#submit-color').val(convertToRGB($(this).val()); });
[02:38:55] <Caroga> I fire the transformation event upon saving, so I have the HEX value available the entire time the user is editing the colors, and when saving I quickly transform it.
[02:39:29] <Cork> Caroga: you risk getting problems with the form validators
[02:39:56] <Caroga> I dont validate the color input in the browser.
[02:40:08] <Caroga> If that's what u mean ?
[02:40:12] <Cork> Caroga: but future spec change might
[02:40:19] <Caroga> Hmm true.
[02:41:12] <Cork> as the spec specifies that the field should be rgb hex
[02:41:35] <Caroga> you are correct.
[02:41:36] <Cork> i see nothing strange if a form submit would fire validation error if you replace it with a none rgb hex
[02:42:00] <Caroga> I agree with you.
[02:42:08] <Cork> it even dictates that it has to be lower case :)
[02:42:20] <Caroga> uhu
[02:42:24] <Caroga> that's true.
[02:42:31] <Caroga> I will go with your suggested solution.
[02:42:50] <Cork> Caroga: remember to not have a name attribute on the display element
[02:42:59] <Cork> that way you won't get two values server side
[02:43:30] <Cork> also you might want to set autocomplete="off" so you don't get weird behavior there
[02:43:30] <DRSK> I've got 5 elements where one of them has an .active class applied, now I'd like to get that elements eq(); what would be the easiest way of doing so? $.each( elem, if ( this ) hasClass( active ) var myEq = this .eq()  ?
[02:43:31] <Caroga> It's already gone. Also, it wont be auto processed since I am using entities on the backend.
[02:43:46] <Caroga> autocomplete="off" on the html5 color picker?
[02:44:08] <Cork> Caroga: first of, html5 is a marketing term
[02:44:11] <Cork> it isn't a spec
[02:44:25] <Cork> just html color picker
[02:44:28] <Caroga> oke.
[02:44:42] <Cork> and yes autocomplete is an OLD html standard attribute
[02:44:51] <Cork> it is to suppress the autofill feature of the browser
[02:45:04] <Cork> where some browsers even replaces what the server sends
[02:45:29] <Cork> and for hidden fields that you change with js it can be... lets say surprising :)
[02:45:45] <Caroga> ah, it's for the hidden field, not for the displayed color picker input ?
[02:46:16] <Cork> Caroga: depends on what you need, but i don't see a reason to have it there
[02:46:32] <Caroga> Me neither :)
[02:46:40] <Caroga> Thank you very much for your help Cork, much appreciated
[03:02:31] <boodllebat> can i use jquery.load() to post and then load iframe ?
[03:03:10] <Cork> no
[03:03:22] <Cork> .load can only make get calls
[03:05:37] <trini7y> Cork: you did not reply me
[03:05:50] <boodllebat> Cork: how to make GET calls using load ?
[03:06:07] <Cork> boodllebat: $('selector').load(url)
[03:06:14] <Cork> that is all .load does
[03:06:29] <martisj> mornin`
[03:06:31] <Cork> it loads the resource and replaces the content of the element matching the selector
[03:06:33] <boodllebat> Cork: you said i can request for GET vars
[03:06:47] <Cork> uh, no
[03:06:55] <Cork> you can make get >CALLS<
[03:07:29] <krambiorix> how can i sort my accordion ? http://jsfiddle.net/umwnveqv/
[03:10:02] <boodllebat> Cork: can you please tell me how do i make GET calls from load
[03:10:13] <Cork> boodllebat: i just did
[03:10:20] <Cork> ~4 mins ago
[03:10:45] <boodllebat> Cork: $('div').url(www.x.com?var=id);
[03:10:50] <boodllebat> Cork: is this right ?
[03:11:01] <Cork> ...
[03:11:09] <Cork> you're kidding right?
[03:11:45] <Cork> if not, you have to learn to read the responses better
[03:12:26] <Cork> boodllebat: but what are you trying to do?
[03:12:31] <Cork> you keep talking about variables
[03:13:04] <krambiorix> Cork, update for the accordion sorting question : http://jsfiddle.net/umwnveqv/1/
[03:13:17] <boodllebat> Cork: i created a widget i have to protect so it can viewed only in iframe not in seperate window or tabs
[03:13:35] <Cork> krambiorix: please don't prefix me of a question if i haven't commented on it
[03:13:49] <boodllebat> Cork: i'm trying to create a server side system for this but i'm failing in this thing
[03:14:03] <Cork> boodllebat: you can't really do that server side
[03:14:26] <Cork> all you can do is check for the window.parent in the js script
[03:14:46] <krambiorix> Cork, sorry, i was planning on asking you but i changed my mind and then updated my comment without removing your name
[03:15:11] <boodllebat> Cork: window.parent ? will it work ? can it protect url inside my iframe ?
[03:15:18] <Cork> krambiorix: don't ask specific persions, just ask the question
[03:15:25] <Cork> or you might not get an answer
[03:15:52] <Cork> boodllebat: firstly, the web isn't built for drm
[03:15:59] <Cork> you will have a HARD time doing that
[03:16:04] <boodllebat> Cork: what is drm ?
[03:16:13] <Cork> uh
[03:16:18] * Cork drops this...
[03:16:43] <krambiorix> how can i sort my accordion ? http://jsfiddle.net/umwnveqv/1/
[03:16:43] <boodllebat> Cork: i'm new :) what is drm ?
[03:30:06] <AdamPDotty> Cork: i'm new :) what is the web?
[03:30:22] <Cork> <_<'
[03:33:04] <krambiorix> nevermind the question
[03:49:00] <Uhkis> Cork being trolled again
[04:04:41] <Woet> Uhkis: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[04:06:02] <Uhkis> Woet: yo!
[04:13:32] <gtristan> How do you get the boolean state of an <input type="checkbox"> ?
[04:13:44] <gtristan> Or, more importantly to me... how do I ?
[04:14:56] <Kartagis> checked or not checked? or checked only?
[04:14:56] <gtristan> .prop() ?
[04:15:41] <gtristan> i.e. var checked = $('theInput').prop ('checked') ?
[04:18:17] <Cork> gtristan: yes
[04:18:32] <Cork> gtristan: also try it and see :)
[04:18:33] <gtristan> Cork, thanks, it looks there are a few ways
[04:18:43] <Cork> gtristan: not really
[04:18:49] <gtristan> yeah, I have been relying on the initial state and picking up the state from the event thus far
[04:19:07] <gtristan> oh, well some SO post says you can use .attr()
[04:19:16] <Cork> there is .is(':checked') that is a very round about way of doing .prop('checked')
[04:19:19] <gtristan> and .is (':checked')
[04:19:23] <Cork> gtristan: and that is why you shouldn't use so
[04:19:28] <gtristan> yeah
[04:19:30] <Cork> cause it is full with wrong answers
[04:19:40] <gtristan> well, I did come here too :)
[04:19:45] <Cork> .attr('checked') won't give you the checked state of the input
[04:19:50] <gtristan> take SO posts with a grain of salt I say ;-)
[04:19:53] <Cork> but if it was checked when the page loaded or not
[04:20:21] <Cork> or rather it won't give you the checked state in all browsers
[04:21:07] <Cork> gtristan: but remember one thing you should only use attr for two specific cases
[04:21:12] <Cork> and all other cases should use .prop
[04:21:19] <Cork> one is data- attribute accesses
[04:21:28] <Cork> as this isn't possible through .prop
[04:21:45] <Cork> and the other is if you need direct access to the raw unmodified attribute value
[04:22:10] <Cork> like .prop('href') vs .attr('href') for <a href="#target">
[04:22:22] <Cork> every other case should be .prop
[04:23:02] <DRSK> Cork » I'm trying to figure out how I can make a "continous" slider thing, so when at :last-child I'd basically want to append the first-child and thus create an endless thing rather than "going back" to the default one. Any suggestions on how one might want to do that? Earlier you taught me using clone and such fancyness basically makes the elements (to some extend) un-selectable with .not() and .is etc
[04:23:29] <Cork> DRSK: again, please don't prefix someone unless they have specifically asked you a question
[04:23:42] <DRSK> Fair enough
[04:24:23] <Cork> DRSK: simplest solution would prob be to just clone the first element and have it twice
[04:24:46] <Cork> and mid slide just jump to the same position on the first element
[04:25:01] <Cork> DRSK: alternatively you could move the elements in the list
[04:25:14] <Cork> so the current element is always the first element in the list
[04:25:32] <gtristan> Cork, honestly my intuition was to aim for $().val()
[04:25:38] <gtristan> but thanks for the info ;-)
[04:25:53] <Cork> gtristan: the value of a checkbox doesn't change
[04:25:57] <gtristan> i.e. because that's what I'm using for text input
[04:26:00] <Cork> only the checked state
[04:26:16] <Cork> forms just ignore the checkbox value unless the checkbox is checked (same for radio)
[04:26:45] <gtristan> right, logically the value of a checkbox is it's checked state, while the value of an entry is it's text, but it might mean something different to someone who is already corrupted with knowledge of how the DOM internals work ;-)
[04:27:06] <Cork> gtristan: no logically the value of the checkbox is the value set on the element
[04:27:42] <Cork> would be kinda strange to have <input type="checkbox" value="a"> elm.value == false
[04:27:55] <Cork> would be kinda strange to have <input type="checkbox" value="a" checked> elm.value == true
[04:29:00] <DRSK> Cork » by moving the elements you mean detaching and then appending to "after" currentSlide ?
[04:29:29] <Cork> DRSK: list = $('ul'); list.apppend(list.children().first())
[04:29:54] <Cork> though you will have to handle the element moving if you go that way
[04:30:44] <Cork> DRSK: absolute positioning the elements and doing it that way is another way
[04:30:54] <Cork> there is plenty of ways to do it :)
[04:31:42] <DRSK> Yeah I'm guessing there is although my case is rather specific; they're fixed and fullscreen centered at all times. Not sure absolute will work the way I'd want it as I'm after a sort of sliding thing (seeing one image dragging in the next etc)
[04:31:44] <Cork> the problem with the latest one is that you can't have a scrollbar that works without js (the other ones problems i've already mentioned)
[04:32:15] <Cork> DRSK: does the sliding ever stops?
[04:32:34] <Cork> meaning does it stay when the image is centered for a little while?
[04:32:45] <Cork> or is it constantly scrolling
[04:32:54] <DRSK> That's the point though, I have 3 images. At the last one, rather than "jumping" to the first (quickly showing the middle one as it swooshes by) I'd simply want to append the first after last and "repeat" I guess.
[04:33:09] <DRSK> There's no timer, only user interaction
[04:33:24] <DRSK> prev/next or nothing (also randomizing the set of images)
[04:33:30] <DRSK> at init I should add
[04:34:12] <Cork> DRSK: ah, ok ya, then i would recommend just cloning the first one and have it last too
[04:34:15] <DRSK> So I'm after something like.. if( last index of slides ) append first image to after last; But I'm unsure how to handle the middle one?
[04:34:19] <Cork> when the animation for the last element ends
[04:34:30] <Cork> just jump to the first image in the list (without animating)
[04:34:36] <DRSK> Ahh
[04:34:46] <DRSK> ofc, that would work!
[04:35:54] <gtristan> Cork, of course I agree, but it forces me to learn weird things about the DOM, like why would an <input type="checkbox"> have a value="anything other than true or false" ? ... why decide to use a valueless 'checked' attribute on the thing in the first place ? ;-)
[04:36:14] <gtristan> the underlying DOM itself is not exactly the most intuitive API anyway
[04:36:15] <Cork> gtristan: ok, lets take that stand
[04:36:26] <Cork> when the element is checked what should the element send to the server?
[04:36:40] <gtristan> absolutely nothing !
[04:36:42] <gtristan> haha
[04:36:45] <Cork> thought so
[04:37:00] <gtristan> one should fetch its value and send something appropriate with an AJAX request
[04:37:09] <gtristan> autoforms are so evil ;-)
[04:37:23] <Cork> what forms does is <input type="hidden" name="do" value="no"><input type="checkbox" name="do" value="yes">
[04:37:42] <Cork> so if the checkbox isn't check no is sent, and if it IS checked yes is sent
[04:37:57] <Cork> and that is why you have value
[04:38:11] <gtristan> eeek
[04:38:24] <gtristan> that is so screwy
[04:38:29] <Cork> not really
[04:38:34] <gtristan> add an extra hidden element
[04:38:42] <Cork> not if you remember what medium this data goes over
[04:38:51] <gtristan> just because the original <input> semantic was not designed with a good enough API
[04:39:09] <Cork> you can't really make a universally compatible representation of a toggle in params
[04:39:20] <Cork> so you need to have a string value to use for it
[04:39:25] <Cork> and it needs to be configurable
[04:39:30] <gtristan> a radio is more difficult, you need a group
[04:39:41] <Cork> gtristan: they work exactly the same way
[04:40:00] <Cork> and the api isn't really an html ting it is limited through how servers worked at the time
[04:40:08] <gtristan> but a toggle can be represented with <input true-value="pony" false-value="horse" value="true"/>
[04:40:31] <gtristan> not that the DOM would understand it, of course
[04:40:36] <Cork> gtristan: but then you would have to define two extra attribute types just for checkboxes
[04:40:50] <Cork> and you would have to define a third one for radio
[04:41:24] <gtristan> certainly, a radio is another thing, but radios have always been annoying
[04:41:43] <gtristan> the only way to handle radio well in toolkits is to refer to them with actual groups
[04:41:59] <Cork> gtristan: so you mean the dtd should define false-value true-values just so js can reuse value?
[04:42:00] <gtristan> instead of specifying their relationship from one to the other
[04:42:04] <Cork> sounds kinda silly to me
[04:42:22] <gtristan> no, I think it should be an intuitive API, that's all ;-)
[04:42:25] <Cork> gtristan: you keep thinking about the elements as a data type
[04:42:40] <gtristan> of course I do, I think of them like widgets
[04:42:40] <Cork> remember when these where created it has to be param compatible
[04:42:45] <Cork> and params has to be string
[04:42:54] <Cork> gtristan: but they aren't
[04:43:04] <Cork> they are data holders for parts in a param string
[04:43:22] <Cork> the widget had to match what was needed for the param
[04:43:27] <Erwat> i hate html
[04:43:33] <Erwat> why can't we just purely use javascript
[04:43:33] <Cork> again it isn't html
[04:43:38] <gtristan> well, when you write a GtkBuilder XML, or a NextStep .nib file, or QML, or ClutterScript, you are always deserializing an interface description into strongly types widget properties
[04:43:44] <Cork> ...
[04:43:49] <gtristan> I dont see how the DOM is really different than this
[04:43:56] <Cork> but gtk widget doesn't have to care about params...
[04:44:14] <Cork> you don't have a remote server that needs to push this data over a command line interface (cgi)
[04:44:39] <Cork> yes, if this was done today things would have been very different
[04:44:47] <Cork> we most likely wouldn't have params at all
[04:44:53] <Cork> and the data would be json encoded instead
[04:45:01] <Cork> meaning we would have had booleans
[04:45:18] <gtristan> You could very well define a widget subclass which does something automated with one of the properties it loads, and pushes that to a server at a given time, it's not really much different
[04:45:38] <Cork> gtristan: not without breaking backwards compatibility
[04:45:54] <Cork> and sure you could create a <newinput> element
[04:45:58] <Cork> but... what's the point?
[04:46:02] <gtristan> oh well there is the key reason to why this is the worst API ;-)
[04:46:09] <gtristan> api compatibility
[04:46:13] <Cork> gtristan: it isn't really an api
[04:46:16] <gtristan> of course, I wont argue that at all
[04:46:30] <Cork> form elements is extreamly special
[04:46:34] <gtristan> html has like 30 years of API to be careful not to break
[04:46:44] <Cork> in that they had a "you must work with this" when they where created
[04:46:53] <gtristan> thank god they dont add stuff to the standard as quickly as they do with C++
[04:47:07] <Cork> and most of what we have today here is out of necessity not out of api
[04:47:27] <Cork> gtristan: uh they add new things to the html/js spec every week
[04:47:36] <Cork> its moving along quite fast now days
[04:47:45] <gtristan> uh oh
[04:47:46] <gtristan> hehe
[04:48:05] <Cork> the thing is what the web would really need is a replacement for the dom interface, it is very slow and a mess
[04:48:18] <Cork> but that won't change much of how forms need to work
[04:48:26] <Cork> as that is cause of external dependencies
[04:48:28] <gtristan> that's the one thing about C++, would be a great language if you removed half the features and there was not 10 ways to accomplish the same thing
[04:48:41] <Cork> gtristan: you men c? :D
[04:48:53] <gtristan> no, the C spec hardly evolves at all
[04:49:02] <Cork> it has actually
[04:49:03] <gtristan> and C89 is good enough for everything
[04:49:11] <kk_drop> do you know any responsive menu plugin that works well with large menus (lv1: 10, lvl2: 20, lvl3: 30 items)
[04:49:20] <kk_drop> I'm wondering what should I use
[04:49:26] <gtristan> well, at least you can tell your compiler to just complain if something outside of C89 is used
[04:49:32] <gtristan> then you avoid the ridiculous
[05:09:42] <krambiorix> When i create a new news item on my page, the news item is saved via ajax and then all newsitems' html are returned with the same request and the body is replaced with that html.... After that i call my function which adds the handlers again. Is this the way to go in using ajax/PHP ?
[05:10:27] <JSnoob> Hey guys is it appropriate to ask for help with a script here?
[05:15:33] <JSnoob> I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/cgxxx2e8/ but the fadeIn/fadeOut continues to activate on pagescroll. How can I make the fade happen only once on the image src changing?
[05:58:57] <rclsilver> hi.. i've a question with jquery.validation: i've a form with 10 email fields... the first is required, other optional. form validation works fine except that the form is submitted if i enter an invalid email in an optional field
[05:59:01] <rclsilver> any idea?
[06:29:00] <assketchup> Any one else having problems, when toggling from class that is higher and wider to a smaller class, it wont show animation
[06:29:12] <assketchup> jQuery ui!
[06:30:01] <Cork> assketchup: you mean the value just snapps?
[06:30:25] <assketchup> no, it will wait the time, and then just snaps
[06:30:40] <Cork> so yes :)
[06:30:55] <Cork> and you're sure the values is supported for animation?
[06:30:59] <assketchup> div be like, i have a animation i need to run, il just wait the time and then snap
[06:31:50] <assketchup> well, im not familiar with those, but i have it in another div, and it works just fine. It is from 80~90% down to pixels
[06:31:55] <assketchup> could that be it?
[06:31:55] <BillCriswell> assketchup: What property are you trying to animate? Also, would a CSS transition be cool for the project? Would probably be a lot better for everything.
[06:32:36] <BillCriswell> assketchup: Try switching them up. I don't think it should matter though. It all ends up as pixels in the long run as far as I understand it.
[06:32:38] <Cork> ya i only use css3 animations now days
[06:32:40] <assketchup> i have 2 different css classes, wait and il type em down
[06:33:06] <Cork> but if i remember correctly uis class animation was a bit buggy
[06:33:25] <assketchup> .data-card-small{ height:325px; width:250px; }
[06:33:31] <Cork> ah
[06:33:34] <assketchup> .data-card-large { height: 94% !important; width: 95% !important; }
[06:33:37] <Cork> then you can't use css3
[06:33:40] <Cork> !!
[06:33:42] <assketchup> toggling between of those 2
[06:33:46] <Cork> never ever ever use important
[06:33:52] <Cork> it kills js animations
[06:34:00] <assketchup> wait a moment and il try
[06:34:22] <Cork> as the inline css can't override it
[06:34:31] <Cork> so the animated values won't have any effect
[06:35:01] <Cork> assketchup: actually that is a good rule for anything in css
[06:35:07] <Cork> you shouldn't ever use !important
[06:35:08] <Cork> ever
[06:35:18] <assketchup> there was a bug, and i patched it with it for then
[06:35:27] <assketchup> never went back to fix it :D
[06:35:40] <assketchup> omg...
[06:35:43] <assketchup> god damit
[06:35:44] <Cork> a better option is to move the rule in the file
[06:35:51] <assketchup> yea ;_;
[06:36:34] <Cork> assketchup: i'm guessing it works now? ^^'
[06:36:38] <assketchup> yea
[06:36:44] <assketchup> thank you so much man <3
[06:36:48] <Cork> np
[06:38:21] <BillCriswell> assketchup: I'd still use a css transition instead!
[06:38:26] <BillCriswell> Just a heads up haha
[06:38:37] <Cork> BillCriswell: you can't animate height with css3
[06:38:50] <Cork> not without graphical glitches at least
[06:39:08] <BillCriswell> If the heights are set you can.
[06:39:33] <Cork> not sure height: 94% is considered set
[06:39:42] <Cork> well it might if the parent isn't height: auto;
[06:40:26] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I assume everything else is set up fine haha.
[06:40:42] <BillCriswell> I do hate doing that max-height / min-height whatever hacky solution.
[06:40:56] <Cork> ya, especially as it doesn't work
[06:41:29] <Cork> and i usually avoid specifying heights of elements
[06:41:43] <Cork> as that is a simple way to introduce rendering errors cross platforms
[06:41:56] <Cork> (much less of a problem now days with webfonts)
[06:42:10] <BillCriswell> Yeah, understood.
[06:49:00] <Kartagis> Cork: is it jquery on https://www.elance.com/q/how-it-works faq?
[06:49:16] <Cork> ...
[06:49:28] <Cork> why is everyone addressing generic questions at me...?
[06:49:41] <Cork> Kartagis: unless it is an answer for a question just ask the question
[06:49:52] <Erwat> have you tried asking yourself that question, Cork?
[06:50:07] <Erwat> as in: "Cork: why is everyone addressing generic questions at me...?"
[06:50:13] <Cork> heh
[06:50:40] <r00s3v3lt> hello, im trying to run circle-progress plugin when its visible on screen but im not strong in jQ :) can someone help me?
[06:51:19] <Cork> r00s3v3lt: you're most likely going to have problem finding someone hooking on that
[06:51:38] <Cork> r00s3v3lt: that sounds more like a freelance question then a help question
[06:52:12] <Kartagis> anyone: is it jquery on https://www.elance.com/q/how-it-works faq?
[06:52:46] <Cork> Kartagis: its not even clear what you're asking about
[06:53:18] <Erwat> TIL
[06:53:23] <Kartagis> Cork: when we click on any of the faq items, an accordion opens?
[06:53:28] <Erwat> you can use console.log("blah: ", object);
[06:53:35] <Erwat> and then object will still be expandable
[06:55:03] <Cork> Kartagis: its a fairly basic drupal site
[06:55:11] <Cork> so ya, most likely jquery
[06:55:30] <Kartagis> k, thanks; just wanted to confirm
[06:55:30] <Cork> though didn't dig too deep into anything there
[06:55:40] <Cork> not i'm not guaranteeing anything
[07:00:59] <frabblerock> hey all. so i did this exercise for a possible employer. they came back and said they noticed some gaps in my code. that's a first for me. what does that even mean?
[07:01:27] <Cork> "gaps in the code"??
[07:01:34] <frabblerock> yeah
[07:01:36] <Cork> did they give any hint to where?
[07:01:41] <frabblerock> I have no idea what that means
[07:01:43] <frabblerock> no
[07:02:08] <Cork> lol sounds like a convenient excuse
[07:02:30] <Cork> its fuzzy enough to be close to impossible to argue against
[07:02:42] <prohobo> uhh
[07:02:51] <prohobo> well i mean, it seems pretty obvious
[07:02:59] <prohobo> they mean your code fails some obvious use-cases
[07:03:07] <prohobo> or not so obvious ones
[07:03:48] <prohobo> allowing SQL injection - is a gap in your code
[07:03:56] <frabblerock> it was a pretty basic front end exercise. i've been doing this stuff for 5 years. I use new technologies, but I wouldn't really call them new anymore. I used sass, grunt, bower, even went the extra mile to send them a build directory of everything minified, optimized, and concatenated. Super confused.
[07:03:57] <Cork> hmm, ya depends on what code they asked to get sent to them
[07:04:01] <prohobo> but yeah, they should be more constructive
[07:04:28] <frabblerock> was just html, css, js at its most basic form.
[07:05:13] <prohobo> well that's not so bad anyway
[07:05:25] <prohobo> i had a programming interview over email once
[07:05:46] <prohobo> the guy sent me a 2000 word explanation of the assignment and said i had one hour to deliver it
[07:05:52] <prohobo> then disappeared
[07:06:13] <prohobo> i went crazy and sent like 10 emails to him
[07:06:17] <Cork> frabblerock: contact them and ask them to pressesie what they emant
[07:06:20] <Cork> *meant
[07:06:23] <prohobo> he never responded, but i got a call back asking if i still wanted the job
[07:06:27] <Cork> or just let it go
[07:06:50] <Cork> cause what you have now isn't anything you can use for anything constructive
[07:07:19] <prohobo> potential employers are like really, really, really abusive spouses
[07:07:30] <prohobo> theyll mess with your head
[07:07:36] <frabblerock> https://github.com/bfrable/front-end-developer-exercise/tree/master/app
[07:07:44] <frabblerock> take a look and let me know what you think of that
[07:07:49] <Cork> you mean like the ones that demand 10 years experience of a language that came out 3 months ago? :D
[07:08:07] <prohobo> yes
[07:08:14] <prohobo> sorry not spouses, more like abusive dates
[07:08:22] <prohobo> i guess when you have a spouse you're already in
[07:08:35] <slax0r> Cork: if you're good, this shouldn't be an excuse
[07:08:57] <prohobo> what shouldn't be an excuse?
[07:09:11] <slax0r> that you don't have 10 years exp on a 3 month old language :)
[07:09:23] <mooncup> Cork: ever seen the post larry wall made about a recruiter asking him how much perl experience he had?
[07:09:29] <Cork> slax0r: if an employer gives you a very vague reason for why they won't hire you, it is usually cause they don't want to for another reason
[07:09:34] <Cork> and just want to cover it up
[07:09:42] <prohobo> ie. abusive date
[07:09:53] <Cork> mooncup: nope
[07:10:05] <prohobo> but i've had employers who were kind of nice and just said i wasnt what they were looking for
[07:10:15] <prohobo> which is always understandable
[07:10:21] <Cork> mooncup: but i've heard of companies asking for 10 years experience of swift...
[07:10:27] <frabblerock> Cork - that's kind of how I feel about this one.
[07:10:28] <slax0r> Cork: yep, that's true...
[07:10:31] <Cork> note it didn't exist 6 months ago
[07:10:35] <slax0r> I was just being sarcastic :P
[07:10:38] <mooncup> lol
[07:11:58] <Cork> on the other hand i love seeing ppl seeking for a job as a programmer
[07:12:16] <Cork> and when you ask them to write "hello" 100 times in code
[07:12:31] <Cork> repeats print("hello"); a hundred times...
[07:12:39] <Cork> (never head of for...)
[07:12:46] <prohobo> you've actually asked someone to do that?
[07:12:51] <mooncup> technically correct though!
[07:13:05] <slax0r> Cork: i -> print("hello") -> esc -> dd -> 100p :D
[07:13:09] <Cork> prohobo: we got a consultant that was meant to write an application for us
[07:13:23] <Erwat> console.log("hello\nhello\nhello\nhello\nhello\nhello...
[07:13:31] <Cork> prohobo: when he had worked there for about 3 months we noticed that all he knew how to write was bad
[07:13:33] <Cork> *bat
[07:13:42] <Cork> hard to write a backup client in bat...
[07:13:44] <prohobo> and you went with a question like that? i mean im glad it actually weeded him out, but what are the chances that would work?
[07:13:51] <mooncup> @ECHO OFF
[07:13:59] <Erwat> Cork: i've written a bat file that was hundreds of lines
[07:14:09] <Cork> so ya, we've started asking simple programing questions when we hire
[07:14:27] <prohobo> man i'd ace that part of your guys' interview
[07:14:31] <Erwat> we had a guy that used a string instead of a boolean in c#
[07:14:42] <Cork> Erwat: after three months he had about 15 lines of comments of psudo bat code
[07:14:46] <Cork> that's it
[07:14:50] <slax0r> I would write 100 lines of code, and sneak in a "you didn't specify how you want it" somewhere randomly :P
[07:14:51] <prohobo> then i'd prolly reveal too much through my unwavering stare
[07:15:09] <Erwat> i wrote that bat file in a few hours though
[07:15:17] <Erwat> batch scripts take up a lot of lines
[07:15:21] <Cork> ya
[07:15:27] <Cork> and it sucks as a language
[07:15:33] <Erwat> but we had a guy who was a C# programmer
[07:15:46] <Erwat> and he wrote something like
[07:16:03] <Erwat> if (isDone == "yes")
[07:16:07] <slax0r> Erwat: to your string instead of bool: http://thedailywtf.com/articles/Extra-Boolean :P
[07:16:11] <Erwat> isDone was a string
[07:16:45] <Erwat> slax0r: i'm afraid of that article
[07:16:57] <Erwat> because #1 "Kristian" is a reasonable name where i am from (estonia)
[07:17:05] <Erwat> and it is dated a few months after that guy got fired
[07:17:10] <Erwat> and such a thing was discovered
[07:17:23] <Cork> a little interesting read http://blog.codinghorror.com/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats/
[07:17:30] <slax0r> lol
[07:17:34] <Erwat> like seriously
[07:17:43] <Erwat> Kristian is a name in estonian instead of like "Christian"
[07:17:48] <Erwat> or something like that
[07:17:58] <Erwat> wait actually it hink it might be Kristjan, i'm not sure now
[07:18:04] <Erwat> Cork: i've read that; blows my mind
[07:18:41] <Erwat> okay that wasn't quite that, slax0r
[07:18:54] <Erwat> but yeah, he used a string, in his words "if i print it out it looks prettier"
[07:20:02] <Erwat> slax0r: a boolean takes up an int's worth of space anyway
[07:20:08] <Erwat> usually
[07:21:41] <Cork> i know one site had a script task you had to solve (a fibonacci function) before you could submit the form :)
[07:22:07] <Cork> and the script had to run for a little while to generate the secret value needed to get through :)
[07:22:35] <Cork> Erwat: that actually depends
[07:22:51] <Erwat> it was server side code
[07:22:51] <Cork> some languages has compact boolean masks
[07:22:56] <Erwat> that would have to handle hundreds of thousands of users
[07:23:00] <Erwat> yeah i know
[07:23:03] <Erwat> have heard of those too
[07:23:18] <Cork> i used to use them all the time back when i did c
[07:24:13] <Erwat> you could fit what? 5 booleans into an int?
[07:24:16] <Erwat> 32-bit int
[07:24:36] <Erwat> wait no what am i saying
[07:24:42] <Erwat> i don't know im spouting nonsense
[07:24:46] <Cork> you could fit 31 bools into one 32bit variable
[07:24:57] <Cork> 32 in some languages
[07:24:58] <Erwat> yeah that's what i'm thinking too
[07:25:04] <Erwat> how i came up with that i don't know
[07:25:09] <slax0r> Erwat: unsigned int takes up more, I think
[07:25:20] <Erwat> slax0r: what do you mean by that?
[07:25:20] <Cork> no
[07:25:26] <Erwat> usually uint is same size as int
[07:25:27] <Cork> sign just means you half the value size
[07:25:34] <Cork> cause you have a sign bit at the end
[07:25:35] <slax0r> oh, right
[07:25:39] <Erwat> int is usually just negative to positive
[07:25:43] <Erwat> uint is 0 to positive
[07:25:46] <slax0r> and I wanted to say unsigned takes up less
[07:26:06] <Erwat> doubles are really cool (or floats)
[07:26:26] <Cork> a sign byte is 01111111
[07:26:32] <Cork> while an unsigned is 11111111
[07:26:38] <Erwat> want to feel more like a badass?
[07:26:38] <Cork> so no no size difference
[07:26:43] <Erwat> instead of writing 3
[07:26:45] <Erwat> write 3.0f
[07:27:05] <gtristan> Cork, I'll read the paper tomorrow, looks very interesting :)
[07:27:19] * gtristan just went through the link
[07:27:30] <Cork> gtristan: if you search the net you will find plenty more where that came from
[07:28:02] <Cork> i've seen reports out of google, mozilla, ibm yahoo (if i remmember correctly)
[07:28:04] <Cork> and a few more
[07:28:22] <gtristan> I've always been of a mind that anyone can accomplish what they set their mind to... but have also been frustrated by some peoples inability to keep up
[07:28:25] <Cork> all stating about the same thing (more then 3/4 of applicants can't code at all)
[07:28:31] <gtristan> an interesting thing
[07:28:45] <Erwat> when i was talking about my final project
[07:29:20] <Erwat> the dude who was my instructor seemed a bit surprised when i said coding isn't really a problem
[07:29:45] <frabblerock> would anyone want to review this and give me some pointers on what im missing
[07:29:46] <frabblerock> https://github.com/bfrable/front-end-developer-exercise/tree/master/app
[07:29:56] <Erwat> turns out he himself didn't really know how to code a whole bunch
[07:30:09] <Cork> heh ya, they usually end up there :)
[07:32:14] <Erwat> frabblerock: are you missing something?
[07:32:30] <frabblerock> Erwat you may have missed the previous conversation
[07:32:36] <frabblerock> was a coding exercise
[07:32:54] <frabblerock> interviewer said there was gaps in my code
[07:34:14] <Erwat> maybe he means the part where your actual content of the site sits in the html file? i'm not sure
[07:34:25] <Erwat> i don't know what people look for in "nice and clean code" with html/js/css
[07:39:43] <prohobo> i like the way you did the exercise
[07:40:48] <fkt> hi all, again :)  can someone give me some ideas on the best way to handle this situation.  im trying to get get to ultimately fetch the contents of a csv file for processing into highcharts.  i have the code working for the chart processing the csv, but from local file only.  the get im using inside of $.get is http://192.168.0.3:5000/z.csv?select%20Date,Close%20from%20hdb%20where%20Sym=`Z     .    the issue im having is that doesnt display the z.csv file in the 
[07:41:13] <fkt> -get get  (coffee time)
[07:41:24] <frabblerock> prohobo maybe theyll get back to me
[07:41:44] <frabblerock> just for something so basic, i'm kind of taken back to hear something so negative
[07:41:45] <prohobo> is that all they said?
[07:41:49] <prohobo> and when did they say it
[07:42:11] <prohobo> i mean
[07:42:17] <frabblerock> "He initially said that he saw some gaps in your code, but wanted his architect to review.
[07:42:17] <frabblerock> The architect review and the feedback was too many concerns were raised about his work on the exercise"
[07:42:18] <prohobo> the app was updated 3 months ago...
[07:42:46] <prohobo> what the fuck is an "architect"?
[07:43:02] <supsup> guy at the end of matrix
[07:43:08] <frabblerock> front end architect
[07:43:17] <frabblerock> someone that does code reviews/etc
[07:43:30] <frabblerock> personally, i think the architect was just an idiot.
[07:43:36] <frabblerock> but i'll wait and see.
[07:44:04] <prohobo> i call those people "managers"
[07:44:11] <MEGAGHZ> lol
[07:44:20] <MEGAGHZ> architect as a planner
[07:44:45] <MEGAGHZ> system architect
[07:45:10] <prohobo> alright im going home :D
[07:45:13] <prohobo> cya
[07:45:18] <supsup> naw i saw him in the matrix movie very last movie it's online you can watch it
[07:50:08] <cjohnson> supsup: :P
[07:55:20] <baako> hi guys why isn't the function running when i click on the link? http://jsfiddle.net/nr1mvhjk/
[07:55:41] <baako> is it because it is a <a> element without href?
[07:56:12] <baako> i dont want to use href but i want to use a? due to its bootstrap styling with ul li
[07:57:54] <decx> that's a scoping issue baako
[07:57:55] <LiENUS> i realize its only... tangentially related to jquery but i cant find a channel specific to it... but is compiling jquery using google closure compiler with advanced mode optimizations still known to be broken? or is there now a fix for it?
[07:58:02] <cjohnson> don't use inline event handlers
[07:58:25] <decx> if you look closely you see that jsfiddle puts your js inside an onload, your inline event handler doesnt have access to that
[07:58:31] <cjohnson> baako: use jquery's .on method to bind to the click event
[07:59:01] <supsup> also move your form outside of your anchor tag also it makes it confusing
[07:59:11] <arup_r> the alert is not being printed.. when I am changing the value of the select box https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/98f6c60751bdf6a5cfa6
[07:59:22] <arup_r> What wrong am I doing ?
[07:59:49] <cjohnson> your paste is missing the HTML
[08:00:09] <decx> select-list1 doesnt exist when you attach the change even
[08:00:20] <cjohnson> but also you aren't binding the second change until the first change fires
[08:00:21] <decx> ajax is async
[08:00:23] <decx> it's in the name
[08:00:56] <BillCriswell> The "a" doesn't stand for "arrogant"?
[08:01:12] <xec> lol
[08:01:20] <decx> it stands for audible sigh
[08:01:48] <baako> cjohnson: thanks
[08:01:56] <LiENUS> decx, dont forget comet makes you vomit too
[08:02:29] <decx> i dont get it
[08:02:38] <LiENUS> they rhyme... the kids song..
[08:02:55] <decx> oh i thought you were a rapper
[08:02:59] <LiENUS> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28song%29
[08:03:00] <decx> :(
[08:04:04] <decx> oh the song that bart sings
[08:04:26] <arup_r> cjohnson: me?
[08:04:40] <decx> see my knowledge about american popculture is restricted to simpsons references
[08:05:07] <LiENUS> i was also joking because comet is used in javascript discussion as essentially the opposite of ajax, and i see a ton of people doing comet using php scripts running on apache server... which makes me vomit
[08:05:35] <arup_r> cjohnson: How to fix it? I am changing the drop down value but the alert is not coming..
[08:06:07] <decx> multifaceted jokes? i'm impressed
[08:06:33] <LiENUS> anyway back to writing js compiler manifests
[08:06:33] <cjohnson> disregard what I said, your crazy indentation made it hard to read. here it is fixed up: http://jsfiddle.net/x423cw5h/
[08:06:58] <cjohnson> arup_r: so now that I've tidied the indentation it seems obvious that the answer is you are binding the event listeners outside of the request.done function
[08:07:03] <cjohnson> so move that last chunk inside request.done
[08:07:07] <cjohnson> or change it to use event delegation
[08:07:15] <decx> i use crazy indentation to send morse code messages to other devs
[08:07:26] <cjohnson> that's you? I thought I was going insane
[08:07:28] <cjohnson> you bastard
[08:07:36] <decx> -.-
[08:07:38] <BillCriswell> decx: That would be hilarious.
[08:07:45] <BillCriswell> decx: Shit, more morse code.
[08:07:56] <LiENUS> morris code? use binary
[08:08:02] <arup_r> How to implement?  or change it to use event delegation
[08:08:15] <cjohnson> arup_r: as I said. move it inside the request.done function
[08:08:19] <BillCriswell> decx: So exactly what do you mean by "r"
[08:08:20] <LiENUS> i guess if you only want to communicate to the ham devs morris code might be good
[08:08:29] <arup_r> humm humm... I missed that :p
[08:08:30] <cjohnson> arup_r: or read this: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:08:31] <BillCriswell> Shit have it backwards.
[08:08:45] <cjohnson> you should learn event delegation either way it's very useful
[08:08:46] <arup_r> thanks for the link.. I'll definitely learn ity
[08:08:50] <BillCriswell> decx: what exactly do you mean by "k"
[08:08:52] <cjohnson> cool
[08:08:54] <LiENUS> now i want to go look through different companies websites and see if they have secret messages in their javascript indentation
[08:09:16] <BillCriswell> --- -.-
[08:09:35] <decx> since when is the o required?
[08:09:44] <decx> i thought the cool kids omit that o
[08:10:15] <BillCriswell> http://morsecode.scphillips.com/translator.html weee
[08:10:56] <arup_r> Yes it is working.. :) But Now I'll do messes with delegation
[08:11:56] <LiENUS> decx, nah all the cool kids nowadays just yell "yo baybay come git u sum" out the window of their car
[08:12:28] <doerteDev> hey. http://pastie.org/9851787 << line 19+20: "TypeError: invalid 'in' operand style" << can someone tell me what's going on?
[08:13:54] <cjohnson> are you sure that's the error for line 19 of your paste?
[08:13:59] <cjohnson> doesn't seem right
[08:19:03] <doerteDev> cjohnson: if i comment them out, the error doesn't pop up
[08:19:20] <cjohnson> that doesn't mean that the error is pointing to that line necessarily
[08:19:27] <cjohnson> it could just be producing the side effect which causes it farther down
[08:19:43] <cjohnson> check your console and make sure the error you have is for the line of code you think it is
[08:21:41] <arup_r> One more issue - https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/98f6c60751bdf6a5cfa6  Each change event not deleting the previous link.. It is keep adding..
[08:22:10] <arup_r> It seems this line -> https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/98f6c60751bdf6a5cfa6#file-ajax-js-L33 has no value
[08:23:04] <doerteDev> hm
[08:23:04] <cjohnson> can you use jsfiddle and tidy your output? these gists aren't very readable
[08:23:14] <doerteDev> cannot search for scrollTop in undefined Oo
[08:23:45] <arup_r> sure
[08:23:49] <cjohnson> arup_r: style note: there's no reason to re-select the select, you already have it as $selectList
[08:24:07] <cjohnson> so just do $selectList.change(...
[08:24:35] <arup_r> humm.. every where?
[08:24:41] <ircbaako> hmm i when to turn my my div class logout to a hand when it get hover right now it just pointer
[08:24:55] <cjohnson> I only see one line that selects it arup_r
[08:24:56] <arup_r> ok got it
[08:24:57] <ircbaako> css or jquery?
[08:25:07] <cjohnson> css ircbaako
[08:25:11] <cjohnson> cursor: pointer I think
[08:25:42] <ircbaako> cjohnson: yep thanks
[08:26:17] <arup_r> http://jsfiddle.net/zxb0nfds/
[08:27:06] <arup_r> cjohnson: ^^^
[08:30:15] <doerteDev> I think the scrollTop is the problem
[08:30:57] <doerteDev> :D
[08:31:09] <doerteDev> $("html, body").animate does the trick
[08:31:41] <cjohnson> yep arup_r! I would also move that event listener above the line where you append the element to the body
[08:34:32] <arup_r> ok.. trying
[08:36:33] <arup_r> not working
[08:36:37] <arup_r> keep adding it..
[08:36:47] <arup_r> cjohnson: ^^
[08:46:30] <cjohnson> Is it unemployed?
[08:46:34] <cjohnson> What does "not working" mean?
[08:47:40] <arup_r> Ok
[08:47:42] <arup_r> :)
[08:47:55] <arup_r> I thought.. you are in the context
[08:47:57] <arup_r> :p
[08:48:42] <arup_r> Each value selection should remove the <p> and add a new one.. But it is not removing earlier <p>.. but keep ading with each value change in the select lst
[08:49:36] <cjohnson> ok. so your remove is not removing elements
[08:49:46] <cjohnson> so the way to debug that is first make sure you are even getting elements to be removed
[08:49:58] <cjohnson> console.log($('#select-list1 > p').length) to check
[08:50:02] <cjohnson> hint: the answer is going to be 0
[08:50:15] <cjohnson> and that's because you can't (or shouldn't) have a p tag inside of a <select> tag
[08:50:20] <cjohnson> so your selector is wrong
[08:50:37] <cjohnson> foo > bar finds bar tags that are the first descendent of foo. Not siblings
[08:52:19] <arup_r> oh..:p
[08:52:33] <arup_r> thankls
[08:52:45] <robertmaxrees> *first descendents.
[08:53:01] <Caroga> Cork just wanted to let you know that it all turned out great.
[08:53:10] <frabblerock> thanks Cork
[08:53:17] <arup_r> git it
[08:53:19] <arup_r> got**
[08:54:50] <arup_r> not working too $('#select-list1 p').remove();
[08:54:52] <arup_r> :(
[08:55:22] <cjohnson> arup_r: so you have a <p> tag inside your <select> tag? that seems wrong
[08:55:37] <cjohnson> you might want to read up on jquery/CSS selectors more
[08:59:14] <arup_r>  insulting:p
[09:00:04] <cjohnson> truth
[09:00:12] <cjohnson> you're not using selectors correctly
[09:00:29] <arup_r> agree
[09:08:37] <arup_r> cjohnson: Fixed... I slapped myself N times.. :(
[09:08:43] <cjohnson> :D
[09:09:55] <arup_r>                 $namesDiv.find('p').remove();
[09:09:59] <arup_r> And I am done
[09:23:12] <arup_r> How can I stop even calling when the value 'Choose a link' will be selected? http://jsfiddle.net/dagm3g15/
[09:23:19] <arup_r> **event
[09:23:29] <arup_r> or avoid event calling
[09:23:40] <robertmaxrees> wrap the handler logic in a conditional that tests for that.
[09:24:24] <arup_r> Ahh.. old school way
[09:24:29] <arup_r> nothing fancy :)
[09:25:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.  i avoid juggling bindings - leave those alone and conditionally run logic instea.d
[09:32:15] <arup_r> can it be improved http://jsfiddle.net/dagm3g15/1/ ? it is working now
[09:33:14] <robertmaxrees> instead of checking someString.length > 0, you can just do someString.length
[09:33:16] <robertmaxrees> 0 is false.
[09:33:39] <robertmaxrees> so if (($("#client_surname").val().length > 0) && (data.length > 0)) { should be if ($("#client_surname").val().length && data.length) {
[09:34:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd consider not using $.each() if you can get away with it an opt for a standard enumerator instead, though that's more personal taste than anything.
[09:36:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd move that event binding outside of the .done() and use a delegated listener instead.
[09:36:37] <robertmaxrees> and finally - $(this).find('option:selected').attr('value') should use .val() instead of .attr('value').
[09:36:51] <arup_r> I don't know... delegated listener
[09:37:02] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[09:41:26] <arup_r> done -- http://jsfiddle.net/dagm3g15/2/
[09:42:31] <pantsofchocolate> weird question how do i run a dynamically named select2? http://jsbin.com/cadiqofeki/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[09:44:25] <jimi_> I have something like $(document).on('click','.button_class', function() { .... }  and inside i am doing something like button = $(this) button.closest('.lname').val();  but getting undefined for the value, but $('.lname').val() shows a value in the console. can I not access it like that?
[09:46:46] <cjohnson> pantsofchocolate: step 1: fix your errors
[09:46:48] <cjohnson> open the console
[09:47:06] <arup_r> can it be done some other way? if($(this).find('option:selected').text() != 'Choose a link'){
[09:47:25] <arup_r> hardcoding I don't like
[09:47:27] <robertmaxrees> one sec, arup_r
[09:47:35] <arup_r> ok
[09:47:42] <pantsofchocolate> cjohnson: it just says undefined is not a function what are my errors with that?
[09:48:17] <robertmaxrees> arup_r - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dagm3g15/3/
[09:48:23] <robertmaxrees> check this out.
[09:48:54] <robertmaxrees> as far as that if statement is concerned, you chould be able to check the .val() of the select itself.
[09:49:09] <cjohnson> pantsofchocolate: String({{form... is invalid
[09:49:16] <cjohnson> why do you have two {{
[09:49:24] <pantsofchocolate> oh sorry thats django template coding
[09:49:36] <pantsofchocolate> it gives me a valid number and creates a valid sstring
[09:49:48] <pantsofchocolate> even renames the id to the proper value
[09:50:42] <arup_r> var $this = $(this);  why needed this variable ?
[09:50:50] <cjohnson> well that's invalid JS so of course your jsbin doesn't work
[09:50:54] <robertmaxrees> arup_r every time you call $() is expensive.
[09:51:01] <arup_r> ok
[09:51:13] <robertmaxrees> arup_r doing it once and storing the result when possible is always a good idea.
[09:51:17] <pantsofchocolate> oh my jsbin was more to show the code thats not working, it wouldnt work out of context i guess
[09:51:24] <arup_r> hummm
[09:51:40] <robertmaxrees> arup_r noticethat i did the same thing with $clientSurname
[09:52:14] <arup_r> Yes.. Yesterday
[09:52:21] <arup_r> I can recall
[09:52:48] <arup_r> dropdown is not coming
[09:53:13] <cjohnson> pantsofchocolate: well, we can't help you with your code if it's not running :P
[09:53:28] <arup_r> 	$clientSurname.on('change', '#select-list1', function() { this part yesterday also didn't work
[09:53:40] <arup_r>  robertmaxrees: ^^
[09:53:44] <robertmaxrees> arup_r dunno why
[09:53:50] <robertmaxrees> oh that's right.
[09:53:50] <arup_r> me too
[09:53:56] <arup_r> why?
[09:53:57] <robertmaxrees> because you're not appending to $clientsurname
[09:54:10] <robertmaxrees> what's the parent element of those?
[09:54:11] <arup_r> so what should be it is?
[09:54:36] <robertmaxrees> ^ see my last question?
[09:54:41] <BillCriswell> Completed in 155.270s at Thu Jan 22 2015 12:53:20 GMT-0500 (EST)
[09:54:53] <BillCriswell> I am the champion.
[09:54:54] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[09:54:55] <arup_r> $namesDiv
[09:54:56] <robertmaxrees> wow.
[09:55:12] <robertmaxrees> arup_r clientSurname is not getting appending to namesDiv.
[09:55:27] <robertmaxrees> those share a common parent - what is it?
[09:55:31] <arup_r> yes it is $clientSurname.after($namesDiv);
[09:55:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not appending it.
[09:55:45] <robertmaxrees> that's adding it after - it's a sibling of it.
[09:55:58] <arup_r> select is under $namesDiv
[09:56:25] <robertmaxrees> lol right. but $namesDiv gets added as well.
[09:56:45] <robertmaxrees> what is the static parent element that clientSurname and namesDiv share?
[09:57:01] <arup_r>  clientSurname is static
[09:57:17] <robertmaxrees> but it is not the parent element of namesDiv
[09:57:35] <arup_r> yes it is
[09:57:50] <arup_r> ohh.. I used after that's why??
[09:57:51] <robertmaxrees> no, it isn't.
[09:57:55] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[09:58:00] <robertmaxrees> for the umpteenth time lol
[09:58:18] <robertmaxrees> and clientSurname is an input iirc, so you can't append to it.
[09:58:28] <arup_r> yes doing
[09:58:48] <robertmaxrees> so clientSurname and namesDiv share a common parent - what is the selector for that parent?
[09:59:19] <arup_r> No. $clientSurname.after($namesDiv); is right
[09:59:36] <arup_r> I wanted too add the <div> after the <input> surname
[09:59:47] <arup_r> I can't append it.
[09:59:49] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:00:23] <arup_r> but it should work 	$namesDiv.on('change', '#select-list1', function() {
[10:00:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:00:31] <arup_r> Why?
[10:00:34] <robertmaxrees> because namesDiv gets added after pageload.
[10:00:42] <robertmaxrees> so that reference breaks.
[10:00:49] <arup_r> how to fix then?
[10:01:04] <robertmaxrees> bind to the parent element of $namesDiv
[10:01:54] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events this explains everything you need to know.
[10:02:22] <arup_r> ok
[10:02:44] <robertmaxrees> the short answer is find the parent element of $namesDiv and bind to that instead
[10:03:41] <arup_r> I bound it.. not working still
[10:03:57] <robertmaxrees> try $(document)
[10:04:15] <arup_r> wait
[10:04:58] <arup_r> after adding your code.. dropdown is not coming.. something wrong happened before that part we are researching.. something screwed up above..
[10:05:05] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:05:07] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.
[10:05:55] <arup_r> :(
[10:06:06] <arup_r> No your refactoring .. :p
[10:06:20] <arup_r> After copy-paste the drop down stopped coming
[10:26:01] <t0astt> If I have a js file that is loaded with the initial page load and includes a selector for a dom element that may be added later (through ajax), the selector won't work, correct?
[10:26:45] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[10:27:24] <robertmaxrees> if you're storing it, at least.
[10:27:42] <robertmaxrees> var $myThing = $('.somethingAddedWithAjax'); // $myThing won't have your stuff.
[10:27:57] <t0astt> but if I were to do something like $(document.body).on('change', 'selector', function() {}); that'd work, right?
[10:28:27] <robertmaxrees> right.  i'd bind lower than document or body.
[10:28:41] <robertmaxrees> but that's not selecting the added dom element - that's selecting $(document.body)
[10:29:34] <t0astt> Ok. I just asked beacuse I have a bootstrap modal that is loaded into the page via ajax on a button click, and I'd like to grab form elements from that modal
[10:30:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, check out the docs for .on() for an explanation about direct vs delegated events.
[10:30:08] <robertmaxrees> it's a pretty simple concept.
[10:30:29] <t0astt> Will do. I just saw that delegated events on stack overflow
[10:30:34] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[10:52:14] <pantsofchocolate> You wont be able to run this javascript people, but do you see anything syntactically wrong with this? http://jsbin.com/fibunesido/1/edit it says Uncaught typeerror undefined is not a function and points to the identifier in the select2?
[10:53:14] <robertmaxrees> is that the rendered output?
[10:53:21] <robertmaxrees> or is that out of your templating system?
[10:53:47] <pantsofchocolate> django templating system, it would come out as like id_equipment_description_4
[10:54:02] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById('id_equipment_description').id = identifier is worrying.
[10:54:10] <robertmaxrees> and then selecting something via that same ID...
[10:54:36] <robertmaxrees> either way, try slapping a console.log($.fn.select2) in front of where you're trying to use it - what do you get?
[10:56:16] <jonez> greetings. I'm having some trouble with a getJSON call that keeps regenerating a session id instead of using the one I've already set when I logged into my account.
[10:56:31] <pantsofchocolate> well bear with me im fairly awful at javascript where is the best place to put that line
[10:56:46] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate literally before the spot where you try to use .select2()
[10:57:08] <pantsofchocolate> ok thats where i have it it returns type error undefined is not a function
[10:57:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/wuwivadugo/1/edit you have this?
[10:58:23] <pantsofchocolate> yes
[10:58:43] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.  do you get the select2 function logged out?
[10:58:57] <pantsofchocolate> actually i see it now, it returns just undefined
[10:59:09] <robertmaxrees> that's why - your plugin isn't loaded before your code runs.,
[11:00:08] <pantsofchocolate> ahhhhh awesome thank you that makes sense
[11:00:27] <pantsofchocolate> the code gets kind of weird here because im using django ajax and javascript to update a page without full reloads
[11:00:38] <robertmaxrees> what's with the String() btw?
[11:00:44] <robertmaxrees> is that a django method?
[11:00:52] <pantsofchocolate> javascript
[11:00:58] <robertmaxrees> don't use that function.
[11:01:01] <robertmaxrees> just write out the string.
[11:01:18] <pantsofchocolate> well it returns and int, i assumed it wasnt casting it properly
[11:01:33] <robertmaxrees> wrap it in quotes or explicitly convert it when you need to use it as a string.
[11:01:54] <robertmaxrees> String(), Object(), Array(), etc are bad ideas.
[11:01:54] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:02:45] <pantsofchocolate> yea that was more me trying to debug originally but now that the real problem is fixed i changed it back, thanks for the help
[11:15:29] <baako> (function ($) { }(jQuery)); is it the same as document ready?
[11:15:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:15:43] <robertmaxrees> that's just an IIFE that ensures you can use $.
[11:16:09] <baako> hmmm
[11:16:38] <robertmaxrees> you can instead use something like jQuery(function($) {}); to achieve a similar effect alonside a document ready.
[11:22:01] <baako> robertmaxrees: http://kopy.io/vD85z returns Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[11:22:16] <robertmaxrees> on which line?
[11:22:27] <baako> doesnt say
[11:22:33] <robertmaxrees> to the far right it should.
[11:22:41] <baako> it says line 261 but
[11:22:44] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[11:22:50] <baako> i do not have linke 261
[11:22:52] <baako> line
[11:22:57] <robertmaxrees> try clicking the link for that line
[11:23:00] <robertmaxrees> hey arthurvr :)
[11:23:05] <robertmaxrees> having a good day?
[11:23:19] <Samian> why learn jquery when you can just use a CMS like wordpress drupal and joomal?
[11:23:35] <baako> robertmaxrees: http://kopy.io/jswGJ
[11:23:41] <robertmaxrees> Samian because knowing a CMS and writing frontend code are different concepts :)
[11:24:03] <robertmaxrees> baako those should be clickable links that take you to your debugger.
[11:24:41] <arthurvr> Samian: you mean learn.jquery.com?
[11:25:05] <arthurvr> Samian: oh I’ve got it
[11:25:07] <arthurvr> haha
[11:25:19] <arthurvr> because those are totally different things
[11:25:27] <baako> robertmaxrees: http://postimg.org/image/llp67e183/
[11:26:06] <Samian> I don't understand why web developers aren't paid as much as developers that make programs with c++ and the like, because web stuff has always seemed pretty confusing to me. More confusing that c/c++
[11:26:25] <robertmaxrees> Samian huh?  i make as much as our backend guys.
[11:26:38] <robertmaxrees> baako weird.  it should give you a specific line to look at.
[11:27:13] <robertmaxrees> oh, i see it. ('#userstatus').prepend(users).slideDown(); - needs a $ in front of it.
[11:27:40] <arthurvr> Samian: That’s not true out of my experience at least :)
[11:28:08] <Samian> basically you have to know jquery to make the CMS that others use too
[11:28:27] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[11:28:41] <robertmaxrees> jquery is very helpful, but i wouldn't say you have to use it.
[11:29:03] <baako> robertmaxrees: thanks
[11:29:42] <baako> Samian: i aint the best frontend guy but when it comes to backend i have more strong skills
[11:30:03] <baako> i will love to learn jquery but javascript put me off
[11:30:47] <baako> i really need to learn it because i dislike page reload
[11:31:00] <robertmaxrees> javascript isn't that bad tbh.
[11:31:33] <baako> robertmaxrees: i have only been programming for about 5 years. am 20 now
[11:31:39] <baako> so i started when i was 15
[11:31:56] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[11:32:25] <baako> i was okay with css and html. but i leak design skills and the ability to make things beautify but if someone give me a design i can duplicate it
[11:32:47] <baako> then i discover php and java and my life was turn around :D
[11:32:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm pretty similar to you for frontend.
[11:32:53] <NoiseEee> i too have a programmers eye for design :|
[11:33:23] <baako> NoiseEee: lol
[11:34:40] <ph88> how can i add a jQuery function, but not on all jQuery objects but just a few ?
[11:34:56] <baako> i think without irc chat i would have given up on programming because I am visual learner and most books leak images or the ability to description in detail
[11:35:27] <robertmaxrees> ph88 if you mean like a plugin, check out the plugin guide - it'll explain everything you need to know :)
[11:35:39] <ph88> no no
[11:35:48] <ph88> i just mean that i can inherit a bunch of methods
[11:36:26] <ph88> maybe $.extend()  ?
[11:36:42] <robertmaxrees> you could do some kind of intermediary prototype that uses jquery as its prototype?
[11:37:11] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do that?
[11:37:14] <t0astt> Can someone explain why my switch isn't working correctly? From the example I saw, it should be working. qtval is being set correctly. http://pastebin.com/vwLy5Ki4
[11:37:37] <IamTrying> https://photosynth.net/preview/  - How to make such picture with jQuery 3d?
[11:38:21] <robertmaxrees> t0astt what's the tyoeof on qtval?
[11:38:35] <robertmaxrees> *typeof
[11:38:54] <t0astt> robertmaxrees: it should be an integer, being pulled from the value of a select drop-down
[11:39:07] <t0astt> unless that is not correct
[11:39:23] <robertmaxrees> t0astt :) welcome to the DOM and javascript and types.
[11:39:30] <robertmaxrees> console.log(typeof qtval);
[11:39:40] <t0astt> I feel a facepalm coming on lol
[11:40:06] <t0astt> Yuuuuup. String. :'(
[11:40:13] <robertmaxrees> boom
[11:40:19] <robertmaxrees> .val() returns strings
[11:40:32] <robertmaxrees> about the only time you'll get to play "let's guess our type!" is with .data()
[11:40:33] <t0astt> So should I just change the case to '#', or cast the string to an integer?
[11:41:11] <robertmaxrees> totally up do you.  I'd probably convert it to a number.
[11:42:29] <t0astt> Yeah, I just ended up doing a parseInt() on the variable. Thanks for your help :)
[11:42:34] <robertmaxrees> or use an object whose properties are the functions you care about and ditch the switch entiorely.
[11:42:36] <robertmaxrees> *entirelyt
[11:42:39] <robertmaxrees> ffff you get what i mean.
[11:42:58] <t0astt> I gotcha (I think :P)
[11:43:09] <IamTrying> Is there any jQuery framework for this? http://www.chronozoom.com/#/t00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/t48fbb8a8-7c5d-49c3-83e1-98939ae2ae67/td4809be4-3cf9-4ddd-9703-3ca24e4d3a26/ta6b821df-2a4d-4f0e-baf5-28e47ecb720b/t6f6e6f61-7f0e-4ce0-bafb-8d414da6aa28/tb37f255b-782a-4f61-b134-df1ba6b45819/tbebb7918-64da-4866-894c-1896e01030cf/t4afb5bb6-1544-4416-a949-8c8f473e544d/taff16829-02c1-47c9-9d6b-ebb297a4d89f/t2b415c

[11:43:21] <pantsofchocolate> jesus christ that is a link
[11:43:38] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[11:43:39] <t0astt> ^
[11:43:42] <ph88> robertmaxrees: this jsperf describe 4 different methods for inheritance http://jsperf.com/object-create-vs-crockford-vs-jorge-vs-constructor/42
[11:44:03] <robertmaxrees> ph88 jsperf doesn't tell you anything about real world performance ;)
[11:44:18] <pantsofchocolate> Ewww its inverted too
[11:44:24] <ph88> robertmaxrees: i'm just saying i found 4 different methods, don't care about performance
[11:44:54] <robertmaxrees> okay - i generally take a more functional approach to JS and avoid dealing with inheritance as much as I can these days.
[11:45:14] <robertmaxrees> especially when it comes to concepts like what you're doing.
[11:45:48] <pantsofchocolate> that site is the most difficult to navidate thing ive ever used
[11:46:02] <pantsofchocolate> navigate*
[11:46:14] <ph88> robertmaxrees: i have an object and i want to bolt on a function that checks if a position is valid. so i need something like  $tile.validMove($anotherTile);  return true or false
[11:48:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah - you can use jquery widgets for that.
[11:48:12] <ph88> o_O
[11:48:20] <robertmaxrees> *plugins, rather.
[11:48:31] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, write a function that does the check for you - isValidMove($tile, $anotherTile);
[11:48:36] <ph88> i don't want that method to be active on all jQuery objects
[11:49:04] <robertmaxrees> there are plenty of plugins that require an init on them to make certain methods available.
[11:49:19] <ph88> well i can probably do  $tile.validMove = function () {};   but how can i add a bunch of functions at once ?
[11:49:24] <robertmaxrees> they often use $.extend() or something similar internally.
[11:50:14] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/ :) check out the examples that use $.extend() - this should show you want you need to know.
[11:50:25] <ph88> i like to do this    bunchOfFunc =  {  validMove: function() {}, someOtherFunc: function() {} }
[11:50:58] <ph88> maybe it's not a jQuery question but a JS one
[11:51:05] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:51:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm showing you one way to do what you want.
[11:51:30] <robertmaxrees> you could use the jquery plugin pattern to init your methods on specific obkects.
[11:51:51] <ph88> hmm
[11:54:14] <robertmaxrees> ph88 this is one of those cases where there are a few approaches - up to you to figure out which you like best.  bolting on to the jquery object so all objects inherit is one way, having some kind of init is another, or taking a functional approach and avoiding inheritance altogether is another :)
[11:55:07] <tdelam> Hi. I am trying to find the nearest fieldset to the button clicked on my simple form and add "disabled" to the fieldset, currently I have this http://jsbin.com/delovulexi/1/edit?html,js,output but it doesn't seem to find the fieldset, any idea why or how I could find the nearest found fieldset?
[11:56:59] <robertmaxrees> tdelam where is the "ore-na" element?
[11:57:30] <tdelam> oh woops, that was removed, let me update
[11:57:51] <tdelam> robertmaxrees: that should actually be "button"
[11:58:11] <robertmaxrees> so how are you defining "nearest" fieldset?
[11:58:17] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of an ephemeral concept.
[11:58:46] <robertmaxrees> you mean the button that's "tied to" a given form?
[11:59:21] <tdelam> robertmaxrees: yes
[12:00:07] <robertmaxrees> mmk, - first off, do this: http://jsbin.com/naletobale/1/edit
[12:00:27] <robertmaxrees> see how i moved the buttons to the inside of each form?
[12:00:38] <tdelam> yep
[12:00:52] <robertmaxrees> then you can just .closest('form');
[12:01:15] <robertmaxrees> .closest() is like .parents() except that it starts on the current element and stops when it finds the first element that matches.
[12:01:21] <tdelam> Oh!
[12:01:41] <tdelam> so I guess the issue itself was the button being outside the <form>
[12:01:47] <tdelam> now i can remove find
[12:01:53] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:01:58] <robertmaxrees> you still need find.
[12:01:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/sezunubawi/1/edit
[12:02:20] <tdelam> i see
[12:02:59] <tdelam> robertmaxrees: thanks that worked out great
[12:03:29] <kevireilly> ello. I've been tasked with adding mouse support to a web application that has none and the end result is about 30 different cases handled by a single click handler along the lines of $(document).on('click', handlers.click). I'm looking to make this implementation more sane by adding handlers to individual elements/parents and due to the dynamic nature of a lot of them, I am finding myself having to do $(document).on('click', '.dynamic_element',
[12:03:30] <kevireilly> handler); which seems like it will be adding many click handlers to document which may be worse performance wise. Thoughts, ideas, consoling?
[12:04:29] <robertmaxrees> kevireilly bind lower when possible on more specific elements.  use delegation.
[12:05:08] <CapnKlutch> I must be doing something stupid, why isn't this working? - http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:05:14] <CapnKlutch> http://jsfiddle.net/ou8r5cr8/
[12:05:18] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: I would like to, but a lot of the elements are dynamically added to the page, so that approach doesn't work unless I shoehorn the binding at the time of insertion
[12:05:49] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ou8r5cr8/1/
[12:06:12] <robertmaxrees> kevireilly then stick with the actual delegated approach - add in the second arg to make things a little clearer/.
[12:06:28] <CapnKlutch> It isn't case sensitive? robertmaxrees
[12:07:02] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch there's some magic and woo that happens behind the scenes with how data attributes get converted.
[12:07:14] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: my main concern is having 20 click handlers being evaluated on every document click where presently I have 1 that goes through a chain of evaluations
[12:07:17] <robertmaxrees> it actually IS case sensitive.  the name just gets lowercases.
[12:07:21] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, okay gret thanks now I know
[12:07:29] <CapnKlutch> *great
[12:07:46] <robertmaxrees> kevireilly different tradeoffs :)
[12:07:50] <kevireilly> for instance, there are 5 or so main evaluations with some that delve into deeper evaluations
[12:08:37] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you want the tradeoff to be.  you said 20 handlers?
[12:08:54] <robertmaxrees> becauce the performance implications there are minimal.
[12:09:04] <kevireilly> probably 30 total cases, but guessing only 20 or so are dynamically added which may not be an accurate estimate
[12:09:20] <robertmaxrees> if your concerns are about performance, don't worry.
[12:09:21] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: ok cool, so you would do the same thing just to keep the code sane, yeah?
[12:09:23] <robertmaxrees> do whatever is most readable to you.
[12:09:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd do something similar, yeah.
[12:09:42] <robertmaxrees> i'd use $(document).on('click', 'someSelector', function() {});
[12:09:48] <robertmaxrees> to make it more redable.
[12:10:01] <kevireilly> yeah exactly what i'm doing, just affraid of document clicks having 20 handlers
[12:10:10] <kevireilly> or however many are dynamic and require that approach
[12:10:30] <robertmaxrees> it won't be an issue unless you're doing something really weird in those handlers.
[12:10:39] <kevireilly> performance is somewhat of a concern because the target hardware isn't very capable, but probably not going ot break the bank here
[12:11:19] <robertmaxrees> worry much more about DOM operations and the like.
[12:11:32] <kevireilly> its mostly simple stuff like adding a class and simulating keyboard presses
[12:11:43] <robertmaxrees> then you're fine.
[12:11:54] <kevireilly> ok, sweet. Thanks for the sanity check robertmaxrees. Much appreciated.
[12:11:59] <robertmaxrees> of course.
[12:12:19] <jonez> greetings. I need some help enabling CORS properly. I changed my js so that it sends session cookies to the server side, however now I get a message in console.log about enabling CORS.. which I've already done :)
[12:12:34] <robertmaxrees> jonez where'd you enable CORS?
[12:12:47] <jonez> on the subdomain that has the php and js files
[12:13:01] <jonez> I'm making a notify system that will work across multiple subdomains
[12:13:05] <robertmaxrees> triple check that to make sure you did it for the right port, protocol, and subdomain.
[12:13:48] <jonez> I put the Header lines into .htaccess ... this has worked in the past, but not when I do jquery getJSON calls
[12:14:11] <kevireilly> jonez: have you evaluated the network request's headers to make sure it is being returned to the client?
[12:14:12] <jonez> does the 'origin' need to be something other than a wildcard?
[12:14:18] <robertmaxrees> right - so make sure that getJSON is calling the correct port, protocol, and (sub)domain
[12:15:03] <jonez> yes.. the GET gets run but is blocked by ff. in the "response headers" from the GET request, I can see my access-control headers
[12:15:30] <jonez> my getJSON call is correct.. all standard ports and such
[12:16:32] <kevireilly> jonez: with * as the allowed origin, for better or worse you should be able to produce a jsfiddle that exhibits this behavior
[12:16:55] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14003332/access-control-allow-origin-wildcard-subdomains-ports-and-protocols says that should work.
[12:17:00] <jonez> could I do something like *.example.com as origin?
[12:17:12] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:17:15] <robertmaxrees> it's all or nothing.
[12:17:15] <jonez> drat
[12:17:32] <robertmaxrees> you can use *, null, or a specific domain.
[12:17:57] <robertmaxrees> you need to setup a router in your application that does that check for you and returns the correct header at the application level, depending on the request.
[12:21:46] <StanAccy> Ive got a div that Im dynamically adding elements to.  Can I bind a function to that div that applies some other JS function to its child elements?
[12:22:11] <robertmaxrees> StanAccy you can .find() to get them and do whatever to them.
[12:22:19] <StanAccy> right now the JS fires on initial load, but I dont get the JS styling applied to dynamically added elements (because they were not in the dom at the time the script ran)
[12:22:53] <robertmaxrees> you'll still need to manually fire your logic.  otherwise you get into stuf like mutation observers which can be a little messy
[12:22:54] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: but if I add a new element (say a user click event initiates a new child div addition), how do I get the JS to run on the new addition without explicitly executing it?
[12:23:10] <StanAccy> oh, ok.  then ill just fire it after addition :-)
[12:23:16] <StanAccy> thanks
[12:23:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:25:50] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: you can bind to a static element that is on the page when events are bound and provide a selector to the event. For example, $('#alreadyOnThePage').on('click', '.dynamicallyAdded', handler); or $(document).on('click', '.dynamicallyAdded', handler);
[12:25:53] <kevireilly> crap
[12:26:02] <kevireilly> meant for StanAccy, though robertmaxrees and I were just chatting about this
[12:26:22] <robertmaxrees> kevireilly reread what they were looking for :)
[12:26:26] <robertmaxrees> they aren't looking for handlers.
[12:26:36] <robertmaxrees> they want to re-run code that modifies elements after they're added to the page.
[12:26:46] <StanAccy> for styling purpoess
[12:26:50] <kevireilly> ah
[12:27:00] <StanAccy> tooltips, select boxes and the like
[12:27:23] <robertmaxrees> that's why there are usuaully manual ways to trigger those things, btw
[12:27:36] <robertmaxrees> so you can do a generic event listener to handle all of it.
[12:37:15] <baako> hi guys. I need your help please. Basically this http://kopy.io/2g2pl  recieves some id from a json file (the json file get refresh every few seconds). Anyways the function stores the "id" in the statuses variable as an array and next time its retrieves new records it then compare the "id" with the ids stored in the statuses variable and then ONLY DISPLAY record which id is not already on the html page. What I want to do now is when it retrieves new
[12:37:16] <baako> records if the "id"(s) in those records does not exists in the old records remove the image. for an example in the first record retrieved it might look like this http://kopy.io/UKMlG then in the second turn when it retrieves new records it might look like this http://kopy.io/Y56FB what i want to do is remove the image with the "id" that was relate to the other records
[12:38:33] <robertmaxrees> baako so only display ones that you got back from the server?
[12:38:58] <baako> robertmaxrees: yes and remove the one that was not in the array
[12:39:27] <baako> right now i am displaying the ones it get back from the server
[12:40:01] <baako> i dont really know how to remove the one that was not
[12:40:03] <robertmaxrees> how are you trying the images back to the array entries?
[12:40:24] <robertmaxrees> because the easiest way to do this is to simply recreate all the <li> elements instead.
[12:40:36] <robertmaxrees> and do a wholesale replacement of what's in the <ul>
[12:41:41] <baako> robertmaxrees: http://kopy.io/k3zzr updated of the first kopy
[12:41:54] <robertmaxrees> what about my explanation doesn't make sense?
[12:42:32] <baako> robertmaxrees: sounds like i show just refresh the ul?
[12:42:53] <robertmaxrees> basically.  recreate it and plop it in.
[12:43:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you need to find a way to tie each <li> back to that array.
[12:43:18] <baako>  this.id
[12:43:26] <robertmaxrees> sure.  you could use that.
[12:43:31] <baako> is how i will tie it baack to the array
[12:43:59] <robertmaxrees> you can use value like that btw.
[12:44:05] <robertmaxrees> use a data attribute or ID.
[12:44:41] <robertmaxrees> replace that with data-currentid and then loop through all your images, test if they're in the array, and remove them if not.
[12:47:22] <baako> step 1 get all the id from the data-id
[12:47:47] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:47:59] <robertmaxrees> step one, use $('li').each() to go through each li
[12:53:32] <baako> robertmaxrees: its too complex for me am just gonna replace the same stand as the other one by instead of addign i will remove. use will php to select the not exists data created by the json
[12:56:50] <krisek101> Hi. I need to use two "methods(I don't know)" in one. For example: $("div").tooltipster(); and $("div2").css(); How to combine these?
[13:03:03] <krisek101> I was trying something like that: http://jsfiddle.net/Lfsfjsq0/ | Only first instruction was working (tooltipster).
[13:11:42] <krisek101> Where can I get help on jquery?
[13:14:33] <varchar> krisek101, you need to include the toolstipster plugin to do that.
[13:15:09] <faraway> krisek101: I don’t think that you have a element with the tag name `div2` in you document.
[13:15:53] <varchar> and you dont have jquery library in that fiddle.
[13:16:07] <faraway> or is it just a sample?
[13:17:37] <faraway> Is it possible to be notified when listener is added/removed for a certain even and to be notified for every event that is emitted of that type?
[13:18:41] <faraway> Is there a better way then overwriting the `on` and `off` function?
[13:18:49] <baako> BillCriswell:
[13:18:54] <baako> are you around?
[13:19:24] <BillCriswell> Yes, very busy though.
[13:19:35] <baako> okay
[13:20:10] <baako> guys if (ids.indexOf(id) === -1) means that the value was never found so how do i check if the value was found?
[13:20:32] <baako> 0? 1?
[13:20:33] <faraway> >= 0
[13:20:34] <BillCriswell> baako: !== -1 or > -1
[13:20:44] <BillCriswell> or >= 0
[13:20:51] <BillCriswell> As faraway said haha
[13:21:53] <baako> lol
[13:22:48] <faraway> does anyone know if there is a plugin around that allows to tell if the `scroll` event happend by user interaction or e.g. by using „.animate“  or „.scrollTop“?
[13:23:48] <BillCriswell> faraway: Ran into a nasty little issue with that recently so you can figure it out for all scroll events besides the last fo some reason.
[13:27:10] <faraway> BillCriswell: I was already able to do a partial wroking solution, but currently I’m at a point where it works in most cases but with some anoying bugs :D
[13:28:18] <BillCriswell> faraway: http://jsbin.com/hulese/1/edit?html,js,output is the test case I made up the other day.
[13:28:18] <faraway> BillCriswell: Ideally i would like to add a property to the scroll event with the information „reason“ that could either be „user“ or „script“ (or somethign similar). So that i can be able to interrupt a scroll animation when the user uses the wheel or scrollbar.
[13:29:17] <krisek101> faraway: Yes, it's just a sample.
[13:29:20] <faraway> BillCriswell: looks similar to what i tried.
[13:29:45] <BillCriswell> faraway: Yeah, there was some bug that's a "wontfix" if I'm not mistaking because of some browser issues.
[13:30:09] <faraway> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/tndev/ypjruLfc/
[13:31:05] <faraway> BillCriswell: did some expected expextedScrollTop check to see if the anoimation was interruped by a user scroll
[13:34:54] <BillCriswell> Yeah, no idea why that event still fires.
[13:36:00] <baako> BillCriswell: remember what we did yesterday. now i was to remove the ones which are not in the array http://kopy.io/mGBv2 so i am addign an else if statement do you think i can do it like that?
[13:36:40] <robertmaxrees> baako that won't work - you need to go through all of the existing <li>'s on the page ;)
[13:38:11] <baako> so i more of less need to do the same product again?
[13:38:21] <reyley> are japanese urls in english?
[13:38:29] <reyley> wait that didnt make sense
[13:38:39] <robertmaxrees> baako you need ot .each() again through all of the <li> elements, yes.
[13:38:54] <reyley> are the urls of people using computers in non english speaking countries in english
[13:38:56] <robertmaxrees> reyley you mean do they use a latin charset or japanese?
[13:39:21] <reyley> yes
[13:39:50] <robertmaxrees> blend of thw two.
[13:39:52] <robertmaxrees> *the
[13:40:16] <robertmaxrees> you can have URLs in, say, full arabic, complete with those characters.
[13:40:43] <reyley> wont that throw off routing
[13:40:49] <robertmaxrees> why would it?
[13:41:05] <reyley> because i defined my routes in english
[13:41:06] <robertmaxrees> DNS can support it.
[13:41:11] <reyley> or rather latin characters
[13:41:19] <BillCriswell> gnarf: If you're still around I'm curious as to how you'd avoid this issue: http://jsbin.com/hulese/2/edit
[13:41:26] <robertmaxrees> are you talking about visitors to your site, reyley?
[13:41:30] <reyley> yes
[13:41:43] <robertmaxrees> then they'll use your urls.
[13:41:46] <robertmaxrees> whatever that structure is.
[13:42:06] <robertmaxrees> they won't see www.somesite.com/somepath and try to translate and hit that instead.
[13:42:28] <reyley> alright
[13:45:49] <baako> robertmaxrees: if if i want to get the numbers in data-id in http://kopy.io/Q6qj6 http://kopy.io/RDMJ6
[13:46:35] <robertmaxrees> .data('id')
[13:47:13] <BillCriswell> Er, this variable rename helps it make more sense: http://jsbin.com/hulese/4/edit?js,output
[13:48:33] <baako> robertmaxrees: var listItems = $('li').data('id');
[13:48:52] <robertmaxrees> baako no - you need to $('li').each(function() { console.log($(this).data('id') });
[13:49:02] <robertmaxrees> that'll show you the basic ide.a
[13:49:12] <robertmaxrees> for each one, if it's not in the array, .remove() it.
[13:50:03] <baako> robertmaxrees: thanks will try that out later let me go spend sometime with my daughter been sat here for too long
[13:53:27] <boozler> How can I launch a popup dialog from a jquery event?
[13:53:49] <robertmaxrees> do you have a plugin to make the popup?
[13:54:01] <boozler> im using jquery mobile
[13:54:16] <boozler> regarding the dialogs examples, specifically the popup dialog
[13:54:21] <CapnKlutch> Please someone help me, I can't get fancybox to load the content via ajax when I click the yellow button. - http://joinremax.es.vc/campaigns/1
[13:55:09] <CapnKlutch> Here is the plugin I'm trying to use - http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#examples
[13:55:37] <robertmaxrees> boozler http://api.jquerymobile.com/dialog/ explains it.
[13:55:39] <boozler> robertmaxrees: using the "Dialog" popup as an example, I'd like to launch this dialog from code not from clicking the button http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/popup/ try
[13:56:05] <robertmaxrees> you'd use the changePage () method inside of your event handler.
[13:56:52] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, do you think you could take a loom please
[13:56:55] <CapnKlutch> *look
[13:56:57] <robertmaxrees> CapnKlutch i already am yo.
[13:57:06] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, thanks
[13:57:07] <robertmaxrees> your selector doesn't seem to be right.
[13:57:21] <CapnKlutch> Which one
[13:57:36] <robertmaxrees> where is your code for the plugin?
[13:57:36] <CapnKlutch> It gets selected by class I thought
[13:57:57] <CapnKlutch> Looks like I forgot it, woops
[13:58:26] <robertmaxrees> also class="button various fancybox.ajax" doens't make sense.
[13:58:31] <robertmaxrees> should be class="button various fancybox ajax"
[13:58:54] <h2mster> hi
[13:59:53] <boozler> robertmaxrees: I'v tried $.mobile.changePage( "#popupDialog", { role: "dialog" } );
[13:59:57] <boozler> no luck
[14:00:17] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, I updated it, It still doesn't work
[14:00:52] <CapnKlutch> $(".fancybox").fancybox();
[14:01:03] <robertmaxrees> i can read.
[14:01:10] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:01:21] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, good man you are
[14:01:22] <reyley> sassy
[14:01:48] <CapnKlutch> Got it I had to change it to $(".fancybox").fancybox({type: 'ajax'});
[14:01:58] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right :)
[14:02:00] <CapnKlutch> Thanks though,
[14:03:02] <robertmaxrees> boozler do console.log($('#popupDialog').length); - what do you get?
[14:04:17] <boozler> robertmaxrees: nvm I worked it out, code I was looking for was $("#popupDialog").popup("open");
[14:04:24] <robertmaxrees> that works, too.
[14:04:31] <boozler> robertmaxrees: thanks for pointing me in the right direction
[14:04:41] <robertmaxrees> fsho - sorry i didn't have the answer :)
[14:07:27] <BobFrankly> using jquery to retrieve data from a rest API, and needing to control when the rest of my code will fire (holding it off until the rest data is retireved)
[14:07:35] <robertmaxrees> .done()
[14:08:13] <robertmaxrees> basically, any code that should run after the ajax call is finished should be in your .done() call.
[14:09:02] <BobFrankly> is this considered an ajax call?     ticket$paramTicket = jQuery.get(url , function( response ){// response contains site information} );
[14:10:12] <NoiseEee> BobFrankly: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/ yep
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> yes - if you look at the docs (here http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/) you'll see where is says this is a shorthand ajax function.
[14:10:27] <BobFrankly> ty, I dabble in too many languages :P
[14:41:06] <reyley> why doesnt doc ready fire in an external js file
[14:41:15] <reyley> from an*
[14:44:04] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:44:16] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[15:06:59] <t0astt> Am I correct in understand that only one delegated event listener can be attached to an element at a time? For example, I couldn't have an on click AND on change event listener for document.body?
[15:07:39] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[15:07:51] <robertmaxrees> event listeners stack.
[15:08:26] <robertmaxrees> delegated listeners are very similar to normal ones.
[15:08:49] <t0astt> hmm, ok
[15:08:55] <t0astt> I have a bootstrap modal
[15:09:05] <t0astt> it has a #save-question-button
[15:09:14] <t0astt> and a #question-type select
[15:09:40] <t0astt> I have a $(document.body).on('change') attached, as well as a $(document.body).on('click') attached
[15:09:46] <t0astt> the on change works, the on click does not
[15:10:01] <t0astt> using delegated because the modal is injected into the page via AJAX
[15:10:16] <t0astt> and I really would not like to pass all this jquery each time it's injected in :)
[15:10:31] <robertmaxrees> is anything running e.stopImmediatePropagation(); or e.stopPropagation(); on it?
[15:10:39] <t0astt> No
[15:10:59] <t0astt> Want me to pastebin my code?
[15:34:02] <Snerf> I have a website which has an <a> using the jQuery ajaxify , so href="#" , would a .trigger('click') still cause it be be "clicked" ?
[15:39:31] <Robdgreat> any idea why I'd be getting a $ is not defined when jquery is in fact present and loaded by the time the page is done loading?
[15:39:48] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat is your script loaded before jquery?
[15:39:56] <Robdgreat> it's inline in the body
[15:39:58] <robertmaxrees> Snerf yep.
[15:42:08] <Snerf> robertmaxrees, ya, its not working for me tho.. hmm..
[15:44:51] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat go to your console and do $.fn.jquery
[15:44:54] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[15:45:14] <robertmaxrees> Snerf the ajaxify might be checking to see if it's a real or fake click.
[15:47:20] <Snerf> robertmaxrees, ya, I need to see how I can get around that then :)
[15:47:45] <robertmaxrees> dunno how they're verifying.  might be e.which or any of a few other methods.
[15:47:52] <robertmaxrees> proxying logic through the dom is weird though.
[15:48:24] <robertmaxrees> can you manually call the ajaxify thing instead?
[15:48:55] <Snerf> I tried that, doesnt do anything
[15:49:15] <Snerf> I can get the link.. but nothing happens.. so, not sure..
[15:49:22] <robertmaxrees> docs?
[15:49:28] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: "1.11.0"
[15:49:47] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat then yeah, you're running code before jquery exists.  make sure your jquery include is before your body.
[15:50:37] <pantsofchocolate> alright genius jquery people i have a weird ajax question
[15:51:53] <pantsofchocolate> i have a button in a div, the button gets replaced using .html(response) from the return of an ajax request, is there a way to reload the javascript so that it is now linked with the new button created?
[15:52:20] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: yeah, got it. the script includes in my layout were somehow placed in the body at the bottom rather than in the head m(
[15:52:26] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate kind of?
[15:52:35] <robertmaxrees> pantsofchocolate what sorts of js are you trying to "re-link"?
[15:53:00] <pantsofchocolate> haha the ajax of the submit of that button
[15:53:05] <pantsofchocolate> its kind of recursive and confusing'
[15:53:13] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener for it instead.
[15:56:14] <pantsofchocolate> can i do that with a form?
[15:56:23] <pantsofchocolate> var frm = $('#create-entry-{{forloop.counter}}');
[15:56:31] <robertmaxrees> you can do that with anything.
[15:56:40] <robertmaxrees> bind to a parent element that doesn't get swapped out.
[15:56:51] <robertmaxrees> does the form get removed and re-added?  or just its contents?
[15:56:59] <pantsofchocolate> the whole form gets wiped
[15:57:04] <pantsofchocolate> and readded with ajax
[15:57:09] <robertmaxrees> then the parent element of the form
[15:57:20] <pantsofchocolate> ok so maybe like the body of the page?
[15:57:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd bind further down than that.
[15:57:35] <robertmaxrees> but that would work, yea
[15:57:54] <pantsofchocolate> so basically create a named div, around the entire parts being replaced and bind to that
[15:58:14] <robertmaxrees> where are you currently popping the form content?
[15:58:44] <pantsofchocolate> from a html file that includes the other files that are to be replaced
[15:58:56] <robertmaxrees> on the destination page, i mean.
[15:59:18] <pantsofchocolate> its the same page?
[15:59:19] <robertmaxrees> when you run the ajax, you've likely got an .append() that's adding the new form content in, right?
[15:59:33] <pantsofchocolate> i do a .html to replace the current one
[15:59:53] <pantsofchocolate> basically wipe it and start from scratch once its reloaded
[16:00:01] <robertmaxrees> oh, so the form tag is left alone.
[16:00:18] <pantsofchocolate> and along with it is a new button that needs to be binded to the old form.submit function
[16:00:26] <pantsofchocolate> i guess its more the form itself
[16:00:29] <robertmaxrees> just bind to the form.
[16:00:34] <robertmaxrees> .html() replaces the contents of the element.
[16:00:35] <pantsofchocolate> thats how its binded now
[16:00:37] <robertmaxrees> not the element itself.
[16:00:49] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('click', 'button', function() {});
[16:00:59] <pantsofchocolate> see but the problem because
[16:01:01] <pantsofchocolate> becomes*
[16:01:07] <pantsofchocolate> when it loads normal it works
[16:01:23] <robertmaxrees> then something is replacing the form tag as well.  weird.
[16:01:26] <pantsofchocolate> when the first ajax replace occurs if i hit submit it skyps my form.submit function
[16:02:02] <pantsofchocolate> i think it like keeps the old tag around or thats what it was bound to, so whats the best way to bind it to all files that will exist with the same id?
[16:02:19] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to bind to the elements directly.
[16:02:22] <robertmaxrees> you want event delegation.
[16:02:29] <robertmaxrees> feel free to bind to body, just not generally the best ide.a
[16:02:32] <pantsofchocolate> like lets say i have a form called testform, how do i bind an action to all testforms that might exist further down the road initial
[16:02:49] <pantsofchocolate> so i should emcompass what is being replace with a new div and bind to that?
[16:03:00] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to, but i guess so.
[16:03:07] <robertmaxrees> you already have a target that should work fine.
[16:03:22] <robertmaxrees> so it sounds like something else is up.  you're preventing the submit event too, right?
[16:03:50] <pantsofchocolate> yea
[16:04:07] <pantsofchocolate> but the problem is
[16:04:14] <pantsofchocolate> i cant prevent the replaced version
[16:04:14] <robertmaxrees> can you provide a fiddle, please?
[16:04:25] <robertmaxrees> you're overcomplicating this :)
[16:04:46] <robertmaxrees> you need a single delegated handler - you should hinge all of this off the submit event.
[16:05:10] <pantsofchocolate> http://jsfiddle.net/2174wujc/
[16:05:28] <pantsofchocolate> half of it is django template if thats confusing for ya
[16:05:55] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[16:06:03] <robertmaxrees> dynamically generating js like this isn't a good ide.a
[16:06:12] <robertmaxrees> you're also not binding that listener correctly.
[16:06:41] <pantsofchocolate> is it worrysome for hackers to make it dynamic?
[16:06:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:07:09] <pantsofchocolate> like why is dynamically generating it a terrible idea
[16:07:22] <robertmaxrees> tying logic to your data.
[16:07:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uj4a2jq3/
[16:08:00] <pantsofchocolate> yea well i honestly cant think of another way of developing this project haha
[16:08:00] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this instead.
[16:08:18] <robertmaxrees> you'll need ot expose the data for the data prop some other way.
[16:08:28] <robertmaxrees> same with your selector for the html() call.
[16:08:42] <robertmaxrees> before your code was erroring out, causing some bugs.
[16:09:00] <pantsofchocolate> yea it only would work with django
[16:09:27] <robertmaxrees> it's less about that and more about increasing the complexity of the code.
[16:09:45] <robertmaxrees> also you were doing event.preventDefault() without actually passing in the event object, which would cause that handler to error and do nothing.
[16:10:04] <robertmaxrees> use data attributes on your html if you need to pass data from your backend.
[16:10:52] <pantsofchocolate> wait my code is too complex or needs to be more complex?
[16:11:12] <pantsofchocolate> gotcha yea im more django and python not much of a jquery/javascript guy
[16:11:26] <robertmaxrees> generating code like you are makes it more complex.
[16:12:01] <pantsofchocolate> haha well your binding idea is actually exactly what i needed haha it worked perfect
[16:12:22] <robertmaxrees> get your js out of your djano template files and you're good to go.

[17:41:18] <baako|away> BillCriswell: aint you asleep yet?
[17:41:40] <BillCriswell> Haha, only 8:45.
[17:45:51] <baako|away> 1:45 here
[17:46:26] <baako|away> i wanted to know the inArray function you passing the value and then the array
[17:48:19] <baako|away> http://kopy.io/dM1PB how do i get values from data-id and check it with the array?
[17:53:47] <baako> BillCriswell: so i am trying to remove li with the id that is not in the array so i have done http://kopy.io/85piv
[17:53:57] <baako> but that removes all of the li
[17:55:16] <BillCriswell> baako: $.inArray() returns -1 when something is not found, which is truthy.
[17:55:57] <BillCriswell> baako: if($.inArray(li, statuses) > -1)
[17:56:00] <BillCriswell> is what you'd want.
[17:56:14] <BillCriswell> but also, $('li') selects all li's.
[17:56:46] <BillCriswell> also, don't need the else if
[17:57:39] <baako> BillCriswell: so li.remove(); using var li = $(this).attr("data-id");
[18:00:15] <BillCriswell> baako: No.
[18:00:22] <BillCriswell> li will only a string.
[18:00:41] <baako> will or with?
[18:01:03] <BillCriswell> will
[18:02:06] <BillCriswell> baako: http://pastie.org/pastes/9853212/text I think this is what you're shooting for.
[18:02:36] <BillCriswell> I have to run though, later.
[18:09:24] <baako> :( doesn't work
[18:14:56] <Duvdevan> sup niggas
[18:15:36] <Duvdevan> so a question about long polling
[18:16:04] <Duvdevan> it's just about to re-send the request recursively through a function, right?
[18:17:24] <baako> lol Duvdevan
[18:21:26] <Duvdevan> baako I kinda got that idea from this stackoverflow question brotha
[18:23:47] <baako> just think its disrespectfully you coming out like that
[18:30:56] <Duvdevan> baako what?
[18:31:23] <Duvdevan> baako: so I've used this as a tip: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/333664/how-to-implement-basic-long-polling
[18:31:36] <Duvdevan> so what did I say wrong when I mentioned: recusrive function?
[18:32:17] <baako> Duvdevan: I am not a jquery expert
[18:32:54] <Duvdevan> ?
[20:04:54] <gnarf> `tell BillCriswell the "scroll" event can't be dispatched by the browser until "the frame after" the JS scrolled it --- (requestAnimationFrame || setTimeout)(function() { scrolling=false; }); should do it
[20:04:54] <b-ot> gnarf: I’ll tell BillCriswell about that.
[20:18:55] <rangergord_> There's a jQuery-based table library I'm using that uses a URL to fetch remote JSON to populate itself. However, I'd like to run a 2nd pass once the table is fully ready. I got working code when the JSON is local (buildTree() followed by modify()), but if it's remote, buildTree() returns with a single "Loading!" node. So I looked at events (http://wwwendt.de/tech/fancytree/demo/#sample-events.html), I can't see what I could
[20:18:56] <rangergord_>  use to do something after it's done loading. I tried the postProcessing event, no dice, still a loading one.
[20:19:10] <rangergord_> could I get some advice from a jQuery greybeard? What can I do here?
[20:35:50] <firered> hi
[20:35:55] <firered> i am new to jquery
[20:36:03] <firered> any recommended tutorial
[20:36:09] <firered> i learn from web
[21:12:51] <code_worker> Hello, anyone there to talk about jQuery Dom Manipulation - how good it is
[21:12:54] <code_worker> ?
[21:13:44] <Nautilus> relative to?
[22:16:09] <gtristan> Hello channel
[22:16:25] <gtristan> So I'm having trouble with the .on() documentation vs. it's behavior
[22:16:34] <gtristan> Here is an example of it: http://jsfiddle.net/p1fctjqt/9/
[22:17:05] <gtristan> When you click on the popover button, it activates the popover, when you click anything outside of the popover, it should deactivate the popover, that works
[22:17:23] <gtristan> if you click inside the popover, the handler for the '*' selector should not trigger
[22:17:25] <gtristan> but it does
[22:18:01] <gtristan> The documentation for .on() explicitly states:
[22:18:04] <gtristan>  "Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist at the time your code makes the call to .on()"
[22:18:38] <gtristan> However this seems to be untrue, perhaps due to some sneaky intrusive optimization related to the special '*' selector
[22:26:21] <gtristan> Hmmm, I think I have an idea what's going on
[22:26:27] <gtristan> there is bubbling
[22:26:52] <dismist> man anyone have any clue why one of the faces is missing on this cube? http://jsfiddle.net/c4q2h3k9/
[22:30:22] <Uhkis> gtristan: you're doing a very simple thing so, so complex
[22:30:48] <gtristan> Uhkis, you got a better way ?
[22:31:59] <gtristan> you can just explain the technique, I don't need you to spell it out with a program or anything, just let me know if you have a better way ;-)
[22:32:45] <gtristan> I put this problem in the background yesterday while tending to other things, this is something that someone came up with, actually his version was this: http://jsfiddle.net/p1fctjqt/3/
[22:33:10] <gtristan> notice though, it also fails, since when you select an item in the boostrap-select, it deactivates the popover
[22:34:01] <gtristan> Uhkis, for unrelated reasons though, the popover should only exist when it's active, this is because many buttons on elements of a list can exist at the same time, so I want it also built dynamically on click
[22:34:14] <gtristan> maybe that's the complexity you're referring to
[22:38:32] <gtristan> not such a simple thing then is it ? ;-)
[22:39:14] <Uhkis> just move your js-generated html to html and you're done
[22:39:59] <Uhkis> and the jq part is like 10 rows
[22:41:27] <gtristan> Uhkis, the js-generated part is not there in real life
[22:41:51] <gtristan> in real life the popover itself and the select is templated into another isolated class
[22:42:55] <gtristan> so my popover button code just does something like: editor = new SomeEditor (); ... and $(this.node).popover ({ ... somthing to give editor.node to the new popover ...})
[22:43:19] <gtristan> but the fiddle does this dynamically to get closer to the real world case, where everything is constructed dynamically
[22:49:27] <Uhkis> gtristan: http://jsfiddle.net/p1fctjqt/21/ seems like the simplest solution to the problem
[22:53:40] <satio> hey guyz
[22:53:42] <satio> http://jsfiddle.net/tn9mvuqL/2/
[22:53:43] <satio> that's my fiddle
[22:53:45] <satio> is there any way to find the all li
[22:53:46] <satio> does not want to use the click function
[22:55:27] <Uhkis> "the all li" ?
[22:56:09] <satio> yes
[22:56:13] <satio> uhkis
[22:56:25] <satio> there is three li
[22:57:02] <Uhkis> $('li'); ?
[22:57:25] <satio> sorry  $('li'); ? i am not understand
[22:57:42] <Uhkis> that would select all the <li>'s
[22:57:56] <satio> ok
[22:58:11] <satio> but is it work on my fiddle
[22:58:41] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/tn9mvuqL/3/
[23:00:31] <aro> if i have a nested unordered list, how can i each over it recursively?
[23:01:46] <satio> hey uhkis it's work fine but i need a li id value like 1 2 3
[23:01:50] <gtristan> Here this get's my problem solved correctly: http://jsfiddle.net/z44jn15L/
[23:02:11] <gtristan> with a bit of a hack as I have to invade and peek the content when I receive the global clicks
[23:02:35] <satio> var disabl = $("#cart ol li").find("li").prop("id");
[23:03:00] <gtristan> but at least it only involves blacklisting content with knowledge of actual popover, so the popover button code itself need not have knowledge of the page in which it is added
[23:03:33] <gtristan> guess the hack is not bad, it excludes any open selectpicker (and another selectpicker cannot be open at the same time anyway)
[23:04:10] <Uhkis> satio: then loop through them
[23:05:58] <Uhkis> ?ask
[23:05:58] <b-ot> Uhkis: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:07:10] <satio> one thing i want to know  when i am using the this function   it's give me the second li id value why $("#cart ol li").find("li").prop("id");
[23:07:45] <kazi> Hi guys! I need to create a sticky (on scroll) nav menu like http://99u.com/ in which I want to put my contact number.
[23:08:26] <kazi> Is there any familiar plugin or technique you know can help in my case?
[23:09:07] <Kartagis> kazi: do you already have the nav menu or do you want us to do it?
[23:10:05] <kazi> I have a fixed scrolling menu in my local wordpress installation
[23:11:36] <kazi> but I just need to know how could I add my contact number with that scrolling menu bar?
[23:20:00] <Uhkis> and how is this jquery related question
[23:21:38] <Kartagis> that's what I am too wondering
[23:22:14] <Kartagis> Uhkis: maybe jquery scroll and css in addition?
[23:45:50] <gtristan> Question about memory management
[23:46:18] <gtristan> When I do $('.someClass').on ('click', function (e) { ... });
[23:46:28] <gtristan> then I have a connected event to that selector
[23:46:41] <gtristan> where does that go away ?
[23:46:46] <Cork> no to the element matching the selector
[23:47:11] <Cork> or rather element(s)
[23:47:34] <gtristan> so if that/those element(s) is/are removed from the DOM, the event handler is released ?
[23:47:43] <Cork> no
[23:47:55] <Cork> the gc handles releasing those
[23:47:58] <gtristan> must absolutely call .off() ?
[23:48:10] <Cork> when nothing is referencing a section of data
[23:48:15] <Cork> the data is released
[23:48:21] <Cork> same for dom elements
[23:48:27] <gtristan> well, sure, but the removing of the elements marks it for cleanup
[23:48:30] <gtristan> correct ?
[23:48:38] <Cork> no
[23:48:56] <Cork> just detatching it from the dom doesn't mean it will be removed
[23:49:04] <Cork> only when no variable is pointing to the element
[23:49:27] <Cork> what keeps the data alive when it is in the main dom is the parentNode reference
[23:49:43] <gtristan> right, a better question is, if I connect events to elements with .on(), must I explicitly care about releasing those with .off() ?
[23:49:43] <Cork> detatching just means setting that reference to null
[23:49:48] <gtristan> I guess the answer is no
[23:50:03] <Cork> no you don't have to
[23:50:21] <gtristan> good to know, thanks :)
