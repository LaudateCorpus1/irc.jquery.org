[01:51:49] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/57sbqx8n/12/  hi all, how to detect wich checkbox was pressed i aminterested in get the first collumn, the numbers,1288 952 and so on... thanks
[03:23:24] <IamTrying> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/FVZXfgvNsj/ - line 12 always showing 'old value'
[03:24:02] <robertmaxrees> IamTrying that's because $.get() is async
[03:24:19] <robertmaxrees> put the alert inside the callback and it'll work fine.
[03:25:33] <dimi1947> is there any problem using this syntax:$(document).on('click', '.item', function(event)...on NON dynamically created elements?...I use it oly for dynamically created element
[03:25:38] <IamTrying> thank you robertmaxrees
[03:26:02] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 avoid binding to document.
[03:26:17] <robertmaxrees> bind to the parent container(s) instead.  but otherwise, nothing wrong it that at all.
[03:26:33] <robertmaxrees> IamTrying also: is find_selected_items a jquery object?
[03:26:52] <IamTrying> yes robertmaxrees
[03:27:10] <robertmaxrees> then don't use $.each() - do find_selected_items.each() instead.
[03:28:30] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees: you are advice relates to both non dynamic elements AND dynamically created?
[03:28:40] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 yep.
[03:29:12] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 though the utility can be semi-limited when doing it that way with non-dynamically generated elements.
[03:29:34] <robertmaxrees> but binding everything to $(document) is a bad idea.
[03:30:43] <dimi1947> why?
[03:31:06] <robertmaxrees> for starters, jquery will have to filter every event of that type to see if it should handle it or not.
[03:31:22] <robertmaxrees> just bind to the parent component in those cases instead.
[03:31:33] <robertmaxrees> much easier to read and understand your intent later on, to boot.
[03:34:53] <dimi1947> ...so it is a performance issue too
[03:35:01] <robertmaxrees> it can be in some edge cases, yes.
[03:35:22] <robertmaxrees> but primarily it's far more readable and understandable.  go for that first
[03:39:53] <dimi1947> can I bind to the parent more than  1 element so the same function executes for more that one element...in this case same event..click
[03:40:35] <robertmaxrees> so you want the same listener for multiple elements?
[03:40:50] <robertmaxrees> then sure.  bind to the parent "component" and go to town :)
[03:41:22] <dimi1947> ok..thx
[10:43:37] <dimi1947> how I can clear the values of the datepicker...val() clears the input but does not "reset" it...so to speak
[10:47:37] <dimi1947> I think I found sth
[12:59:11] <FightingFalcon> i cant use jquery in AMP pages. But my table of content plugin needs it. so that i can hide/show contents. Is there a way to use it?
[12:59:53] <robertmaxrees> AMP gives you a specific subset of js.  there was once a way to hack around it by using iframes, but that defeats the purpose of AMP :)
[13:00:14] <robertmaxrees> at least, last i checked.
[13:02:53] <robertmaxrees> FightingFalcon ^
[13:03:14] <FightingFalcon> do you know a bit of css?
[13:03:25] <robertmaxrees> i know css, but head to #css for any questions :)
