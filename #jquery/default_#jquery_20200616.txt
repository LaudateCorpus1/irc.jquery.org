[18:21:38] <factor>  Anyone know how to get Owl Carousel to center on picked item ID?
[22:10:01] <Jaseinatl> has detatch been deprecated and if so, how do I move an element in the DOM?
[22:10:52] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/detach/ doesn't say it's been deprecated.
[22:11:02] <robertmaxrees> you can also just select and .append() the element elsewhere.
[22:12:41] <robertmaxrees> so

[22:13:29] <robertmaxrees> Jaseinatl
[22:13:38] <Jaseinatl> thanks for your reply. I am struggling with something really simple, i think
[22:13:55] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[22:13:56] <Jaseinatl> I have a card that has two faces. Depending on the card's class one or the other is showing.
[22:14:07] <Jaseinatl> I need to cycle quotes into the hidden side, then flip the card
[22:14:33] <Jaseinatl> So I have all the quotes in a hidden div that I can pull from. Then I just grab the next one and swap them out.
[22:14:51] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[22:14:56] <Jaseinatl> Seems simple enough..not working. Gimme one sec to produce a codepen.
[22:15:04] <robertmaxrees> rad
[22:21:09] <Jaseinatl> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/ZEQBGQb
[22:21:28] <Jaseinatl> Just typed it in, haven't tried troubleshooting it yet..
[22:21:31] <robertmaxrees> uh?
[22:21:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:22:36] <robertmaxrees> and have you tried opening your dev tools?
[22:22:40] <Jaseinatl> somewhere it is losing my "card" element
[22:22:57] <Jaseinatl> I was working locally on a much bigger project so I had to thin it down to post here
[22:23:04] <Jaseinatl> I was hjurrying so as not to waste your time.
[22:23:10] <robertmaxrees> so - have you tried opening your dev tools?
[22:23:15] <robertmaxrees> because it offers a big hint
[22:23:40] <Jaseinatl> I see that, but don't understand how it is detatching th ecard element.
[22:23:58] <robertmaxrees> it's erroring on content.appendTo(".quote_source");
[22:24:37] <Jaseinatl> I am an idiot. Sorry. It is kind of working now...
[22:24:50] <robertmaxrees> not an idiot :)
[22:24:57] <robertmaxrees> just needed a finger pointing you in the right direction.
[22:25:16] <Jaseinatl> I really appreciate your patience and help. Thanks.
[22:26:00] <robertmaxrees> All good!
[22:26:10] <robertmaxrees> S'what we're here for :)
[22:34:42] <Jaseinatl> My end goal was something like this: https://davidwalsh.name/demo/css-flip.php where I load the content into the non-visible side every 4 seconds or so.
[22:35:44] <robertmaxrees> ah, so trying to modify that concept?
[22:36:09] <Jaseinatl> Yes. I figured it would be easy to swap the contents before toggling the class
[22:36:22] <robertmaxrees> So I gotta ask - what are you putting in these spots?
[22:36:33] <Jaseinatl> quotes for an attorney
[22:36:46] <robertmaxrees> Mmm.  I might be careful with that.
[22:36:54] <Jaseinatl> why is that?
[22:37:08] <robertmaxrees> Same reason carousels are generally a bad idea.
[22:37:40] <Jaseinatl> I'm listening...
[22:37:45] <Jaseinatl> whjy are carousels bad
[22:37:45] <robertmaxrees> a few considerations: if it's stuff for the end user to read, you're assuming they can digest the content in a certain amount of time before it transitions.
[22:38:07] <robertmaxrees> they're also very, very poor for a11y.
[22:38:07] <Jaseinatl> It's fluff
[22:38:20] <robertmaxrees> also: most end users go blind to content like that.
[22:38:28] <robertmaxrees> they see automatic animations and basically ignore it.
[22:38:56] <Jaseinatl> Agreed, and technically it's just bs that goes there. It's filler at the bottom of the page in the sidebar.
[22:39:10] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[22:39:18] <Jaseinatl> right now, I have it appear as images in the background that are next to impossible to read
[22:39:19] <robertmaxrees> so if users will ignore it, why have it at all? :)
[22:39:31] <Jaseinatl> they look like graffitti but not easy to read at all
[22:39:41] <robertmaxrees> you're basically trading "next to impossible to read" with "next to impossible to read"
[22:39:50] <robertmaxrees> why not just give the text a solid color background over that image?
[22:40:03] <Jaseinatl> basically just kissing my bosses ass.
[22:40:15] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[22:40:39] <Jaseinatl> I thought ti woudl be easy and suggested it. I should have kept my mouth shut. LOL
[22:40:47] <robertmaxrees> haha.
[22:47:51] <Jaseinatl> Got it! Finally. https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/ZEQBGQb
[22:48:12] <Jaseinatl> I'll write some function to determine the time based on the length of the quote and hope that works. LOL
[22:48:41] <robertmaxrees> Or - even better - kill the autotransition and put dots/arrows so the user can control it themselves.
[22:54:37] <Jaseinatl> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/ZEQBGQb
[22:54:52] <Jaseinatl> pretty easy. Now to just make it look pretty.
[22:56:37] <Jaseinatl> I gotta run. Thanks again for all your help..
