[02:56:28] <wfpkhc> hello! :P
[02:56:42] <wfpkhc> can i please ask for help with this jquery issue?
[02:56:43] <wfpkhc> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/yGWLVx
[02:57:45] <Cork> you need to start by specifying what the issue is
[02:58:03] <wfpkhc> i will be right back
[02:58:12] <wfpkhc> its the third set of images - the count on the lightbox it wrong
[02:58:14] <wfpkhc> be right back
[03:07:31] <wfpkhc> im back
[03:07:33] <wfpkhc> sorry about that
[03:07:39] <wfpkhc> in the third set of images
[03:07:41] <wfpkhc> when you click on it
[03:07:52] <wfpkhc> its showing 5 images as total - when its not its supposed to be 4
[03:10:37] <wfpkhc> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/yGWLVx
[03:11:09] <Cork> wfpkhc: i don't see any code there at all that would even atemt to do that
[03:12:42] <wfpkhc> thats because its handled by the
[03:12:46] <wfpkhc> carousel
[03:12:49] <wfpkhc> code
[03:12:51] <wfpkhc> in the javascript
[03:13:02] <Woet> wfpkhc: so what is your jQuery question?
[03:13:37] <wfpkhc> [19:09] <wfpkhc> its showing 5 images as total - when its not its supposed to be 4
[03:13:48] <Woet> that's not a jQuery question.
[03:14:01] <wfpkhc> yes it is - its using jquery 3
[03:14:15] <Woet> so?
[03:14:29] <wfpkhc> oh hey woet
[03:14:30] <Woet> its also using HTML and CSS, that doesn't make it a HTML or CSS question.
[03:14:34] <wfpkhc> i see you again :P
[03:14:51] <wfpkhc> the jquery plugin im using
[03:14:57] <wfpkhc> seems to miscount -
[03:15:04] <wfpkhc> when combined with lightbox
[03:15:08] <Woet> so contact them.
[03:15:08] <wfpkhc> allow me to link
[03:15:27] <wfpkhc> i tried
[03:15:30] <wfpkhc> but no response
[03:15:35] <wfpkhc> thus why im here :P
[03:15:43] <wfpkhc> https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
[03:16:08] <wfpkhc> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/carousel.php
[03:16:31] <wfpkhc> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/yGWLVx  - this combines those 2
[03:16:55] <wfpkhc> and i have managed to get everything working except those 2
[03:17:06] <wfpkhc> except that - numbering issue*
[03:17:58] <wfpkhc> and i was wondering if anyone has any ideas that might help sir
[03:27:37] <wfpkhc> anyone?
[03:27:45] * wfpkhc sits quietly*
[03:28:40] <Cork> wfpkhc: i haven't used carusel enough to be able to help without digging into it, and i don't have time for that right now
[03:35:50] <wfpkhc> ok
[03:35:52] <wfpkhc> thak you sir
[03:36:00] <wfpkhc> all the best im going
[04:04:12] <bestdesign> morning
[04:24:06] <bestdesign> when use id to select elements there is better to use this current element and .find for that id?
[04:24:16] <bestdesign> or matter?
[04:25:03] <Cork> you mean if it is better to search for the element from based from the current "this" element or to use a global search?
[04:25:11] <bestdesign> yes
[04:25:15] <Cork> doesn't matter for simple selectors
[04:25:17] <bestdesign> you are correct
[04:25:29] <bestdesign> ah ok
[04:25:30] <Cork> #id and .class has hash tables in the browser
[04:25:52] <Cork> but '#id span div ul li' would benifit from $(this).find()
[04:26:06] <bestdesign> yes i got it
[04:26:18] <Cork> same with $(this).find('[title="a"]')
[04:26:42] <Cork> ^ that benifits i mean
[04:27:04] <bestdesign> Cork what you prefer for select > option with :eq(0) or by .find title?
[04:27:24] <bestdesign> .find value sorry
[04:27:34] <Cork> bestdesign: i prefer to qeustion why you need to select the option to begin with
[04:27:50] <Cork> if you just want to change the option selected, just use .val()
[04:27:58] <Cork> directly on the select element
[04:27:58] <bestdesign> I have set a ,prepend to insert text before values
[04:28:02] <Cork> ah
[04:28:14] <bestdesign> in select > option
[04:28:19] <Cork> then .find('[value=""]')
[04:28:44] <Cork> if "this" isn't the select element you want to have select before the option
[04:28:55] <Cork> but avoid > unless you absolutely have to
[04:28:59] <bestdesign> 	#('#optionid').parent().find('option:eq(0)').prop('selected', true)
[04:29:00] <Cork> cause it slows things down
[04:29:02] <bestdesign> i use this now
[04:29:20] <Cork> i would replace eq(0) with :first-child
[04:29:32] <Cork> as :eq() is a jquery function
[04:29:46] <Cork> .find('option:eq(0)') is identical to .find('option').eq(0)
[04:29:48] <bestdesign> and what about
[04:30:08] <Cork> bestdesign: also worth mentioning this is micro optimizations
[04:30:14] <bestdesign> 	$('#optionid').parent().find('option').not(':eq(0)').prepend('Choose category: ')
[04:30:20] <Cork> unless you have ten of tousens of elements it won't matter
[04:30:25] <bestdesign> so with .not first ?
[04:30:30] <Cork> or unless you do this several times a second
[04:30:36] <ZPEnf> How do you do a wildcard search on a string in jQuery? some like "If <string> is like value*" ? I tried .indexOf but that doesn't seem to work for multi-word strings?
[04:30:46] <ZPEnf> if (Z('#Name').val().indexOf("This is a string that changes") >= 0) {     Z('#tGroup').val("Some other value"); }
[04:30:47] <Cork> bestdesign: it is better to write code that is easy to read
[04:31:02] <Cork> and if you get preformance problem, optimize
[04:31:39] <Cork> ZPEnf: you don't; you do it in javascript
[04:31:53] <Cork> jquery is a helper lib to help you select and modify dom
[04:31:57] <Cork> it doesn't work with strings
[04:32:19] <Cork> (with the exception of addClass and removeClass)
[04:35:40] <ZPEnf> Alright, thanks
[04:36:19] <Cork> ZPEnf: also it works for multi word strings as long as it is a substring
[04:36:48] <Cork> "a b c d".indexOf("b c d") == 2
[04:36:56] <Cork> but it has to match exactly
[04:37:05] <Cork> (including case)
[06:08:29] <ilaraca> Good morning, someone would have some example of changing a number to a string, for example
[06:08:31] <ilaraca> Example: Integer = 3; I expect a 3x3 square back just like below as a string
[06:08:33] <ilaraca> output:
[06:08:35] <ilaraca> +++
[06:08:37] <ilaraca> +++
[06:08:39] <ilaraca> +++
[07:02:47] <Cork> ilaraca: Array(3+1).join('+')
[07:03:18] <bestdesign> hi guys
[07:03:47] <Cork> ilaraca: or Array(3).fill('+').join('')
[07:03:47] <bestdesign> $('[data-test_scroll]').on('click', scroll); I have a function with scrollTop: where I need set custom values how can make with this function?
[07:04:15] <Cork> bestdesign: wrap it in an anonymous function
[07:04:46] <bestdesign> well i am not that pro still
[07:04:52] <Cork> .on('click', function(event) { return scroll.call(this, event,'extra'); })
[07:04:54] <bestdesign> scrollTop: $('#ownvalues').offset().top - 65 - 15 - 15
[07:05:37] <bestdesign> uh is a bit new for me
[07:05:55] <bestdesign> what is 'extra'
[07:05:55] <bestdesign> ?
[07:06:00] <Cork> a string
[07:06:26] <Cork> that wraps the call to scroll and lets you add all the arguments you want
[07:06:44] <Cork> this, is to forward the originial this variable
[07:06:53] <Cork> event is the first argument (same as originally)
[07:08:07] <bestdesign> well and where i can call to own values?
[07:08:21] <bestdesign> oh i am confused
[07:10:21] <bestdesign> .call is jquery?
[07:10:24] <pavonia> "event" and "'extra'" (and possibly more) are the arguments to the scroll function
[07:10:39] <Cork> .call is standard javascript
[07:10:51] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[07:10:58] <bestdesign> yes i just google
[07:11:27] <bestdesign> With the call() method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
[07:12:29] <bestdesign> well is ok but how I can tell to whitch extra I want to scroll?
[07:13:51] <pavonia> The element is "this", you can just use $(this) in your function
[07:14:10] <pavonia> That's thre reason Cork suggested using call() here
[07:14:15] <pavonia> *the
[07:17:59] <bestdesign> $('#button').on('click', function(e){	return scroll.call($(this)), e, 'extra');})
[07:18:03] <bestdesign> this one?
[07:18:56] <bestdesign> so I need to call with extra elements to scroll?
[07:19:42] <bestdesign> sorry for noob
[07:23:18] <pavonia> bestdesign: No, scroll.call(this, e, ...) and function scroll(e, ...) { use $(this).offset() here }
[07:24:02] <pavonia> "this" in scroll will be the same as the one from the handler
[07:28:12] <bestdesign> like $('#button').on('click', function($(this).offset())
[07:28:13] <bestdesign> ?
[07:30:28] <pavonia> Or that, yes
[07:32:36] <bestdesign> and how to include preventDefault();
[07:32:37] <bestdesign> ?
[07:32:44] <bestdesign> in arguments?
[07:37:09] <pavonia> In arguments? Not sure what you mean
[07:38:29] <Cork> bestdesign: if you want to call preventDefault() before you call scroll, just call event.preventDefault()
[07:38:54] <Cork> if you want to do it from inside scroll just call <name of second argument in the scroll function>,preventDefault()
[07:41:02] <pavonia> Why not first argument?
[07:42:11] <bestdesign> i am a bit lost
[07:42:21] <bestdesign> is not that easy :D
[07:43:08] <bestdesign> OHHHHH
[07:43:15] <bestdesign> I need to rethink all LOL
[07:43:18] <bestdesign> IM a NOB
[07:49:04] <bestdesign> stil lhow can do that when .on click on scroll function after scroll do something?
[07:52:14] <bestdesign> well i think need to separate the scroll function and do something thing
[07:52:39] <bestdesign> both is not good
[07:54:07] <Cork> pavonia: lol typo...
[07:54:11] <Cork> it is first -_-'
[07:55:38] <bestdesign> Cork you are an op ?
[07:56:16] <Cork> bestdesign: no
[07:58:00] <bestdesign> Cork still as you a pro about jQuery you think about how can use css :target if set event prevent default to scroll smooth? I mean that ignore :target to set style
[08:14:18] <bestdesign> somehow is possible to combine  a :focus with a scroll function?
[08:14:55] <Cork> no, you havae to store the state in a shared variable (ex. .data()
[08:14:57] <Cork> )
[08:15:41] <Cork> bestdesign: you can't use css :target in js
[08:15:51] <Cork> but you can check the url params
[08:16:16] <Cork> (and this has very little to do with jquery, it is what javascript can do)
[08:20:06] <bestdesign> well now I removed repeat smooth scroll but :focus now jump a big up before fill elements ah
[08:20:30] <bestdesign> .focus()
[08:20:32] <bestdesign> sorry
[08:23:30] <bestdesign> 		if ($('#input:input').is(':invalid'))		{			e.preventDefault();			$('#input').focus();		}
[08:24:03] <bestdesign> .focus() is always jump big up?
[08:25:17] <bestdesign> on focused element?
[08:25:28] <Cork> i donno how you smooth scroll
[08:25:37] <Cork> but ya, unless you use that function it will jump
[08:26:47] <bestdesign> well now how include the .focus with smooth scroll? I mean how I can get that element to scroll?
[08:26:53] <bestdesign> ah :(
[08:27:12] <bestdesign> problems in problems
[08:27:59] <bestdesign> on button i cant use href to scroll with
[08:33:03] <pavonia> bestdesign: You would do an animation for smooth scrolling, I think
[08:33:45] <bestdesign>        $('html,body').animate({          scrollTop: target.offset().top          }, 1000, function () {          $("#comment-textarea").focus();        });
[08:33:55] <bestdesign> i got this but is always needed to repeat?
[08:33:57] <bestdesign> as I see
[08:34:04] <bestdesign> on every field
[08:36:30] <pavonia> Here's a more sophisticated example: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/
[08:38:15] <bestdesign> thanks
[08:38:31] <bestdesign> and you too Cork
[08:38:43] <Cork> yw
[09:48:14] <bestdesign> on click callback can use (this)?
[09:51:44] <bestdesign> as i see yes
[12:30:51] <bestdesign> hi
[12:31:02] <bestdesign> whats the logic for that elements where need to set with var?
[12:31:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> fiddle duder.
[12:31:21] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're trying to do.
[12:31:52] <bestdesign> ahah rob
[12:31:58] <bestdesign> okey
[12:32:50] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees how is good to select > option from jQuery? with [value=] or with :eq(0) 1 2 3 so on best performance?
[12:33:00] <robertmaxrees> heh?
[12:33:09] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[12:33:46] <bestdesign> 		$('#selectid').parent().find('option:eq(0)').prop('selected', true);
[12:33:51] <robertmaxrees> fiddle.
[12:34:08] <bestdesign> is select first option
[12:34:27] <bestdesign> it also can do with [value="first"]
[12:34:27] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to select by value or...?
[12:34:42] <bestdesign> i mean what is best speed?
[12:34:44] <robertmaxrees> rather, are you trying to set the select option by value?
[12:35:01] <bestdesign> i do with :eq(0)
[12:35:04] <bestdesign> for select first
[12:35:06] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[12:35:08] <bestdesign> is there better way?
[12:35:17] <robertmaxrees> the first one is selected by default.
[12:35:21] <robertmaxrees> so your question seems silly.
[12:35:25] <bestdesign> on reset
[12:35:29] <bestdesign> click not
[12:35:34] <bestdesign> reser type input
[12:35:42] <bestdesign> thats need for click event
[12:37:55] <bestdesign> $('option[value="222"]').prop("selected", true);
[12:37:58] <bestdesign> or like this
[12:38:07] <bestdesign> hmm
[12:38:26] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) without seeing a fiddle with a use case it's hard to make any suggestions.
[12:42:55] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign for the record: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lvd7hs3a/
[12:43:02] <robertmaxrees> this is what an isolated test case looks like.
[12:43:05] <robertmaxrees> really simple to do.
[12:49:09] <FilipNortic> bestdesign:  And if you make the test closer to your real use case. It will help get around the XY problem when asking questions:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem
[12:49:48] <FilipNortic> which is a real stumple block for leaning with this kind of help

[12:58:53] <bestdesign> http://jsfiddle.net/z8Lwvgbq/2/
[12:58:58] <bestdesign> whitch is more standard?
[12:59:04] <robertmaxrees> neither/.
[12:59:37] <bestdesign> hm
[12:59:46] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to set the value, right?
[13:00:45] <bestdesign> is can be with .prepend?
[13:00:51] <bestdesign> to add value?
[13:01:02] <bestdesign> .prepend('test')
[13:01:02] <robertmaxrees> could you answer my question?
[13:01:04] <bestdesign> ?
[13:01:09] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to set the value of the select?
[13:01:15] <bestdesign> i want to add before zaza
[13:01:22] <bestdesign> and every option
[13:01:25] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:01:27] <bestdesign> choose from:
[13:01:44] <bestdesign> on all values text
[13:01:54] <bestdesign> sorry for noob!
[13:02:03] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[13:03:02] <bestdesign> before both selected element "zaza" add choose from: text
[13:03:10] <bestdesign> with select
[13:03:15] <bestdesign> it with prop
[13:03:21] <bestdesign> and also add text
[13:03:31] <robertmaxrees> you want to insert an option?
[13:03:33] <bestdesign> "choose from:"
[13:03:38] <bestdesign> text to option
[13:03:53] <bestdesign> before value
[13:04:55] <bestdesign> "choose from: zaza'
[13:04:56] <bestdesign> to be
[13:05:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:05:13] <robertmaxrees> i can't figure out what you're asking for.
[13:05:25] <robertmaxrees> update your fiddle to show me what you want.
[13:06:02] <bestdesign>       <option value="insert text before this choose from with js222">222</option>
[13:07:40] <bestdesign> so I have values 222 and 2222 and zaza
[13:07:50] <bestdesign> i want the first 222 with own text choose from list
[13:08:05] <bestdesign> after first every value add a choose from: and get value from html?
[13:08:50] <bestdesign> http://jsfiddle.net/z8Lwvgbq/3/
[13:08:54] <bestdesign> on list 2
[13:09:04] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaah
[13:09:46] <robertmaxrees> you want it so when you change one select, it updates the other one?
[13:09:51] <robertmaxrees> selects a different value?
[13:10:39] <bestdesign> no
[13:10:48] <bestdesign> all text .prepend to all value
[13:10:51] <bestdesign> only not first one
[13:10:59] <bestdesign> and set for first one another text with .prepend
[13:11:42] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to do that?
[13:12:36] <bestdesign> well is looks better than Service vs: Choose from: Service
[13:12:49] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle with a more realistic example.
[13:13:02] <bestdesign> ok
[13:13:02] <robertmaxrees> as well as an example of what exactly you're looking for.
[13:17:26] <bestdesign> http://jsfiddle.net/z8Lwvgbq/4/
[13:17:27] <bestdesign> first list
[13:18:47] <bestdesign> I want add text Choose from: not for value is for select
[13:18:58] <bestdesign> uh I want too much
[13:19:06] <bestdesign> i need to relax lol
[13:19:15] <bestdesign> well i read docs
[13:19:20] <bestdesign> and learn.
[13:20:26] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing this with jquery?
[13:20:50] <robertmaxrees> why not just render out the selects the right way from the server?
[13:21:17] <bestdesign> is because i use validate on it
[13:21:26] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't change my question?
[13:21:28] <bestdesign> if not selected  value=""
[13:21:31] <bestdesign> error
[13:21:49] <robertmaxrees> you can use jquery validate just find without mucking with the values or text.
[13:22:13] <robertmaxrees> *just fine
[13:24:20] <bestdesign> got it
[13:24:22] <bestdesign> i rethink
[13:24:31] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:25:24] <bestdesign> brb
[13:25:29] <bestdesign> bad idea btw
[13:43:11] <devi8> when trying to create a sticky header, if you switch an element's position to fixed, it repositions the rest of the text. what's the best way to avoid that?
[13:44:05] <robertmaxrees> "it repositions the rest of the text" where?
[13:44:08] <robertmaxrees> you mean the page?
[13:44:42] <devi8> in the scrolling content.
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the rest of the page?
[13:44:54] <devi8> I'm scrolling the main element
[13:44:58] <devi8> so not the rest of the page
[13:45:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see it then.
[13:45:16] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/CuirPork/x53f6w4j/166/
[13:45:31] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:45:35] <robertmaxrees> getting an error there heh
[13:45:37] <devi8> it's messed up because I was trying out position:absolute on the header and content
[13:45:56] <devi8> also, haven't fixed the js.
[13:45:57] <robertmaxrees> the js is broken.  bad paste?
[13:46:44] <robertmaxrees> anyway.
[13:47:42] <robertmaxrees> since you're removing an element out of the flow of the page, it's casuing everything else to shift.  one fix would be to put a wrapping element around the header, set its height statically, then keep doing what you're doing.
[13:47:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, I'd ask in #css
[13:48:00] <devi8> Great. I'll try that thanks
[13:59:48] <devi8> that worked great, thanks. I just have one issue with this sticky header bs: https://jsfiddle.net/CuirPork/x53f6w4j/185/
[14:00:18] <devi8> it works okay, but it jumps

[16:24:42] <Forbidd3n> Anyone here know how I can set draggable to select2 items?
[16:26:49] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[16:27:21] <Forbidd3n> I am trying to initialize draggable on select2 items, but it doesn't allow it
[16:27:46] <robertmaxrees> like the drag and drop setup?
[16:28:01] <robertmaxrees> http://select2.github.io/select2/ this shows how you do it.
[16:32:35] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: that is using tags and I want to drop item into another dev
[16:32:36] <Forbidd3n> https://jsfiddle.net/blupointmedia/tzchwued/3/
[16:33:11] <robertmaxrees> so you want to drag and drop between 2 separate areas.
[16:34:11] <Forbidd3n> I want to drag select2 items to a canvas and on drop in droppable get the text of that item and place it on the droppable
[16:34:30] <Forbidd3n> canvas, meaning a div area
[16:34:59] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: like this answer - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45255331/jquery-ui-drop-event-plain-text-between-text-in-div-contenteditable
[16:35:07] <Forbidd3n> but with select2 items
[16:35:54] <robertmaxrees> so that's... not really how that works?
[16:36:02] <Forbidd3n> ?
[16:36:05] <Forbidd3n> how what works?
[16:36:29] <Forbidd3n> I can figure out the dropping, I just can't seem to figure out the dragging of the select items
[16:37:57] <robertmaxrees> oh, you need to include jquery ui separately it looks like.
[16:39:14] <robertmaxrees> could be wrong though.
[16:45:59] <Forbidd3n> still doesn't work after adding UI
[16:46:17] <robertmaxrees> jq3.x has issues with jqui iirc.  any console errors?
[23:20:46] <ceo_> Hey all! First time in this channel :)
[23:24:45] <ceo_> I'm stuck. I'm trying to take the first 3 chars of one form text input and, on focusout change them to upper case and automatically make them the value of another form text input, but I can't seem to get it to work...been googling for over an hour now with no joy. Here is what I came up with so far: https://pastebin.com/ANgehNY5 ANY suggestions/documentation would be great!
[23:24:56] <ceo_> Unless everyone's asleep :P
[23:25:16] <Woet> ceo_: thats not how you set values
[23:25:25] <Woet> ceo_: http://api.jquery.com/val/
[23:31:37] <ceo_> Woet: Thanks, that helped...I think...gotta try it first :P
[23:37:29] <ceo__> Woet: Now the only question is where I squeeze the .toUpper
[23:37:55] <ceo__> Er..toUpperCase()
