[05:53:39] <Phruis`> i have a login that gets triggered after a certain period of inactivity.  Sometimes I will be logged out, but the page itself doesn't show me being logged out.  How do people usually handle this?  I already have a loop running for notifications and I was thinking I could tap into that and if you aren't logged in just send them to the login page with a redirect.  How do you guys handle this?
[06:05:20] <pavonia> My bank has a counter at the top of the page that shows the remaining minutes left until I will be logged out automatically. However, I've never waited to see what's actually going to happen then :p
[06:06:07] <pavonia> Redirecting to the login page might be annoying, I'd just do nothing and let the page time out
[06:06:27] <pavonia> On a next page call you will detect if the session is still active
[06:17:22] <Phruis`> pavonia, thanks for your input
[07:24:04] <Cork> Phruis`: you could use a poller that contacts the server and checks if the session is still active, or you could use server events to push then the logout happens (if the server actually knows)
[07:24:24] <Cork> or you could use websockets, and simply just close the connection when the logout happens
[07:25:11] <Cork> but the base problem is most often that the logout happens inactively; meaning noone actually knows the session is dead, cause it is detected the next time it is used
[07:55:42] <GSL> does anyone know what the expected response time is for mails sent to security@jquery.com? I have been waiting a week for a reply...
[07:57:17] <Cork> GSL: no i haven't seen anything about that
[07:57:52] <Cork> and it has been a long time since i've seen any of the ones running the project around any of the jquery channels
[08:02:23] <Phruis`> Cork, thanks ill look into those suggestions
