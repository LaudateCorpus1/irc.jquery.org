[01:00:34] <robertmaxrees> ?
[01:00:56] <sydbarret> give me a sec
[01:02:23] <sydbarret> robert im tryi ng to implement this https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/components/stepper/
[01:02:33] <sydbarret> why doesnt want to load the libraries?
[01:02:46] <robertmaxrees> because you didn't put the files in the right place.
[01:02:55] <robertmaxrees> that means that the url you're using isn't pointing to the files.
[01:02:59] <sydbarret> do i have to put the link and css minified at bottom?
[01:03:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:03:13] <robertmaxrees> you mean copy the css onto the actual page?
[01:03:32] <robertmaxrees> how are you linking to the files sydbarret
[01:03:34] <sydbarret> no imean where i have to put
[01:03:37] <sydbarret> the Paths and initialization code are below:
[01:03:48] <sydbarret> am i failing in the initialization?
[01:04:02] <robertmaxrees> did you just copy/paste that html and expect it to work??
[01:04:16] <robertmaxrees> because you need to also have the files on your server.
[01:04:25] <robertmaxrees> in that directory structure.
[01:04:37] <sydbarret> oh i thougt it was a cdn
[01:04:41] <sydbarret> cant i use a cdn?
[01:04:52] <robertmaxrees> if you can find them hosted somewhere, sure.
[01:05:59] <sydbarret> i could find it later , but i dont see the files to download
[01:06:35] <robertmaxrees> https://mdbootstrap.com/pricing/jquery/pro/
[01:06:39] <robertmaxrees> they want you to buy it.
[01:07:08] <robertmaxrees> or: https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/getting-started/download/
[01:07:21] <robertmaxrees> download them there.
[01:07:25] <robertmaxrees> or via npm.
[01:09:48] <sydbarret> i have static folder so i have to copy the their css and js folder inside i guess innit
[01:09:54] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[01:10:09] <robertmaxrees> and then update those link/script tags to point to the files in that folder.
[01:11:26] <sydbarret> oh that only works in the add-ons pro version
[01:11:35] <robertmaxrees> that feature?
[01:11:42] <sydbarret> is that right?
[01:11:49] <robertmaxrees> https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/getting-started/download/
[01:12:16] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/mXPbeu7.png is it not within either of these?
[01:13:07] <sydbarret> i downloaded
[01:13:09] <sydbarret> the zip
[01:13:11] <sydbarret> and shows https://pasteboard.co/JpCSjUS.png
[01:13:11] <robertmaxrees> like, try reading the site to see what it says.
[01:13:53] <robertmaxrees> https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/components/stepper/#how-it-works
[01:14:00] <robertmaxrees> "When you are using our basic steppers you will need to copy and paste HTML code to your HTML file and you will have a static horizontal or vertical stepper."
[01:14:13] <robertmaxrees> everything you want to know is on that site.
[01:16:22] <robertmaxrees> if you need more help with the product they offer: https://mdbootstrap.com/services/
[01:16:25] <robertmaxrees> check out their free forum.
[01:20:08] <sydbarret> seems free only is static
[01:20:10] <sydbarret> crap
[01:20:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:20:31] <sydbarret> i dont see the next button i his horizontal one
[01:20:35] <sydbarret> and no javascript
[01:21:01] <sydbarret> i wanted the horizontal one because its similar to the multistep form i tried to do
[01:21:42] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[01:21:51] <sydbarret> you must have one similar
[01:22:00] <robertmaxrees> and?
[01:22:00] <sydbarret> or doesnt bootstrap has it?
[01:22:13] <sydbarret> im using bottstrap 4
[01:22:17] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[01:22:24] <sydbarret> seems it only has that carousel
[01:22:35] <robertmaxrees> then build your own.
[01:23:20] <sydbarret>  i was trying to make it based on table
[01:23:28] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[01:23:33] <sydbarret> but got complicated when trying the back button
[01:23:40] <robertmaxrees> at what point at you going to learn how to build this stuff on your own lol?
[01:23:44] <robertmaxrees> this is pretty basic.
[01:23:59] <robertmaxrees> you've been at it for a few weeks by now - why not learn the basics and go from there?
[01:24:17] <sydbarret> i had a working sample that i gave you
[01:24:22] <sydbarret> let me check if i got it
[01:24:29] <robertmaxrees> then why not use that??
[01:24:50] <robertmaxrees> and you didn't "give" me anything.  you asked for help and then got snarky.
[01:25:11] <sydbarret> this one https://codepen.io/designify-me/pen/qrJWpG
[01:25:19] <sydbarret> i should study that innit
[01:25:25] <robertmaxrees> "study" lol sure.
[01:25:45] <robertmaxrees> you should also check out something like learn.jquery.com
[01:25:53] <robertmaxrees> and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn
[01:26:09] <robertmaxrees> and any of the dozens of other free webdev 101 courses out there.
[01:26:51] <sydbarret> i dont have too much time my boss give me tasks every day
[01:27:03] <robertmaxrees> and you don't know how to do them?
[01:27:05] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[01:27:13] <sydbarret> from this i have to finish another project that calculates distance between 2 places
[01:27:21] <robertmaxrees> good luck then :)
[01:27:34] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to set some expectations and point out that you need some time to learn.
[01:27:37] <sydbarret> i know python not flask/jquery much
[01:27:45] <robertmaxrees> flask and jquery are entirely unrelated.
[01:28:14] <sydbarret> the sample i gave you
[01:28:19] <sydbarret> uses jquery or javascritt?
[01:28:26] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript
[01:28:28] <robertmaxrees> just a library.
[01:28:29] <sydbarret> looks jquery to me
[01:28:36] <sydbarret> no this last one
[01:28:49] <robertmaxrees> it's javascript which happens to use jquery.
[01:30:11] <robertmaxrees> so you'll have to learn both.
[01:30:24] <sydbarret> its a lot
[01:30:33] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it's part of your job now.
[01:30:48] <sydbarret> i need a chic to be motivated
[01:30:54] <robertmaxrees> a what?
[01:31:04] <sydbarret> send me a girl from california
