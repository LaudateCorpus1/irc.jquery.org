[00:08:59] <pavonia> arosen: You could try this library: https://github.com/emailjs/emailjs-mime-codec
[00:09:29] <Neo4> pavonia: ;)
[00:09:49] <Neo4> pavonia: What is CDN content delivery network?
[00:11:18] <pavonia> It's this encoding, I guess https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Encoded-Word
[00:13:30] <Neo4> arosen: where do you get that code?
[00:13:54] <arosen> Neo4:  from an email subject line.
[00:13:58] <Neo4> pavonia: be is AFK, better speak with me, How are you? ;)
[00:14:05] <Neo4> arosen: oh ok
[00:14:24] <Neo4> arosen: not understandable really
[00:15:37] <Neo4> arosen: and what you want to do? I wouldn't read those mails, that guy who sand that should have been care about it
[00:17:25] <arosen> So i'm working on some code that parses an email and can display it via a webpage. This subject line starts with some special character âœ¨ which is getting messes up once emailed.
[00:17:41] <Neo4> I want to include this lib, what is bowel http://izimodal.marcelodolce.com/#Start
[00:18:29] <Neo4> arosen: and at first you should determine what is that charset
[00:19:04] <Neo4> arosen: what is that utf8 windows cp1251 or others?
[00:19:39] <Neo4> after you know you should decode it to one charset that you use for all scrapped emails
[00:20:36] <Neo4> I have done many scrapers using phantomejs or windowsbrowser
[00:21:33] <Neo4> arosen: what do you use for ger mails? culr, phantomjs, selenium, or something else? Simply interesting...
[00:27:07] <Neo4> arosen: in generalit's impossible determine charset, just removed those mails or store them somewhere...
[00:31:27] <arosen> I just use ses and store the emails in s3
[00:31:39] <arosen> then i read the email right out of s3 and parse it in python
[00:36:31] <Neo4> arosen: it's impossible recognize, read only mails that is not broken
[00:37:20] <Neo4> sometimes I got also broken mails in my MUA(mail user agent) and I simply don't read it.
[01:42:17] <ajkthx> hey im having an issue, i can't get the page to stop reload on button click. i have return false and have tried e.preventDefault.. the site loads html on button press (which works fine) i think that might have something to do with the issue - https://pastebin.com/YAdP1d50
[01:46:22] <Cork> ajkthx: 1. your event handler looks for the form before it exists
[01:46:32] <Cork> 2. don't use element selectors on ids
[01:46:52] <Cork> and double ids in the page is invalid #login is already taken by <span id="login">
[01:52:16] <Cork> ajkthx: https://jsfiddle.net/rbrb8v7w/1/
[01:52:33] <Cork> opps
[01:52:54] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/rbrb8v7w/2/ is what i meant to have there :)
[01:54:21] <ajkthx> okay cool, what exactly did you fix here? it seems to work i just dont get it
[01:54:47] <Cork> 1. i removed return false; you should never use it as it makes extending the page _impossible_
[01:55:07] <Cork> 2. i changed the submit event handler from an element selector to a delegated event handler
[01:55:22] <Cork> this is as the form doesn't exist in the page so a selector doesn't find anything to bind to
[01:55:56] <Cork> while a delegated selector can find future existing elements, as you bind it to one that is in the page and it listens to bubbling events
[01:56:10] <Cork> 3. i changed the duplicate #login on the form to #login-form
[01:56:36] <ajkthx> oh so like if its bound to just the element (like $('formsubmit').on('submit'...)) when the page first loads it only checks if formsubmit exists?
[01:56:46] <Cork> (also in the future use jsfiddle not pastebin)
[01:56:56] <ajkthx> and the (document) just checks whenever anything is submitted
[01:57:03] <ajkthx> kinda sorta?
[01:57:12] <Cork> ajkthx: $() is a selector it constructs a list of elements that matches the selector
[01:57:39] <Cork> then .submit(func) (a shofthand for .on('submit, func)) loops this list and binds an event handler to each one of them
[01:58:01] <Cork> if $() doesn't return anything .on('submit') does nothing
[01:58:18] <Cork> $(document) is just a selector that wraps the document element
[01:58:49] <Cork> then .on('submit', '<selector>', func) binds on document (in this case) and binds the event submit but looks for bubbling events matching <selector>
[01:59:28] <ajkthx> gotcha i get it now thank you so much
[01:59:39] <Cork> np
[01:59:52] <Cork> btw if you haven't already it might be worth looking through learn.jquery.com
[02:00:14] <ajkthx> i just didnt really know what to look up im pretty new
[02:00:18] <ajkthx> i figured i would just learn as i go
[02:00:47] <Cork> ya, learn.jquery.com is a fairly short crash course that goes through this among other things
[02:02:25] <ajkthx> thanks man
[02:02:29] <Cork> np
[02:05:59] <ajkthx> in this case since im inserting and removing html from the container, would it be ok to use an id more than once if that id will never  be on the page at the same time
[02:06:11] <ajkthx> or only 1 instance of that id will be on the page at one time i mean
[02:06:35] <Cork> ya, though i would still recommend to keep them unique, it makes the code easier to understand
[02:20:28] <Neo4> Cork: hi
[02:20:47] <Neo4> Cork: which package manager do you might suggest to use?
[02:20:55] <Neo4> bower or npm?
[02:21:07] <Cork> pick one you like, i don't really use one
[02:21:27] <Neo4> what do you use instead?
[02:21:47] <Cork> i prefer to have the package locally so i know the project builds even if a server have problem
[02:22:06] <Cork> so nothing really
[02:22:44] <Neo4> Cork: I used to do it before, but now want to try modern method using package managers, seems it can be faster
[02:23:16] <Cork> depends, it has problems too
[02:23:43] <Cork> obscure error messages is one of the biggest problems i've hit
[02:23:53] <Neo4> in one file we can store all our packages and then when we need some progect we'll simply create file package.js with dependences and run npm install and we'll got all
[02:24:15] <Cork> yup, as long as the npm server doesn't have a problem :)
[02:24:19] <Cork> then you can't build at all
[02:24:40] <Cork> (as you don't have the source)
[02:25:43] <Neo4> Cork: do you think it will faster than manually copy past? but from other site there might be change versions and it will led to other errors. Might be better save all libs locally in folder :)
[02:26:11] <Cork> Neo4: depends on what you mean faster
[02:26:14] <Neo4> anyway I'll try
[02:26:29] <Neo4> Cork: fast include needed lib
[02:26:56] <Cork> personally i don't have that many dependencies, so i just have the links for the latest 3-4 libs i need and just download the zips and extract them
[02:27:06] <Neo4> Cork: you won't create new folder put there jqueyr plugin files
[02:27:20] <Cork> jquery is one js file...
[02:27:30] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[02:27:54] <Neo4> you need get shortname and do npm install nameofplugin, for example I did it npm install jquery and got it in folder
[02:28:17] <Cork> ya, they download each project into folders
[02:28:18] <Neo4> Cork: there many is copied with examples not one
[02:28:24] <Cork> its just how it structures it
[02:28:38] <Neo4> Cork: yes and fast, manually you'll do it longer
[02:28:46] <Cork> not really
[02:28:56] <Cork> and again i value reliability over saving 2-3 seconds
[02:30:06] <Neo4> Cork: well, I've understood you pint. will think about and try to make my mind :)
[02:30:29] <Neo4> point*
[02:30:44] <Neo4> your point*
[02:30:57] <Cork> Neo4: keep in mind, that problem has already happened once https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/
[02:35:18] <Neo4> Cork: some libs possible only install using npm http://izimodal.marcelodolce.com/#Start
[02:35:40] <devi8> How can I make a the level 2 elements of a multilevel ordered list draggable to a container without making them sortable amongst themselves or their parents in the original ordered list (jqueryui)?
[02:36:28] <Cork> Neo4: some do, that one isn't one of them though (first link)
[02:37:33] <Neo4> Cork: only first link, if I want look on code?
[02:37:47] <Cork> uh... it is in the first link...
[02:38:51] <Neo4> yes, I thought there cant copy. Ok
[03:15:09] <devi8> http://jsbin.com/rozijih/edit?html,css,js,output
[04:11:29] <Neo4> how i can get json data from this url??? https://int.datachannel.cloud/frontendsrv/apihandler.api?cmd={%22api%22:%22ls-games-by-operator-id-get%22,%22operator_id%22:%22241%22}
[04:12:34] <Neo4> I used this code https://hastebin.com/madefolari.lisp
[04:13:02] <Neo4> and get error No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
[04:13:31] <Cork> Neo4: unless you run on https://int.datachannel.cloud; you can't
[04:13:48] <Cork> the server have to allow cross domain requests, and that domain doesn't
[04:14:11] <Neo4> Cork: why this can? http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?jsoncallback=?
[04:14:15] <Neo4> I can this
[04:14:42] <Cork> it is most likely meant to be called server side, not from inside the browser
[04:15:06] <Cork> also the laster one is jsonp not json
[04:15:27] <Cork> it is an old solution to work around this restriction (not days cors is used instead)
[04:15:40] <Cork> it loads the content as javascript and executes it
[04:16:02] <Neo4> what?
[04:16:14] <Neo4> don't understand, this both url look similar
[04:16:24] <Neo4> what is differ?
[04:16:40] <Neo4> https://int.datachannel.cloud/ this I can't
[04:16:55] <Neo4> and why I can from api.flickr.com ???
[04:17:12] <Cork> jsoncallback=? gives it away, if you look in the http response header you see the second difference
[04:17:33] <Cork> the second response is test/javascript not application/json
[04:17:45] <Cork> (but the meaningful difference is in how it is called)
[04:18:10] <Neo4> ok, understood
[04:18:24] <Cork> the second one is called as javascript, and the caller defines a function, and the server then responds with a script doing theFunctionProvided(json);
[04:18:27] <Neo4> badly understood
[04:18:30] <Cork> so it is very different
[04:19:07] <Cork> and through that the client gets the response from the function executing and returning it to the calling code
[04:19:45] <Cork> like i said, it is called jsonp if you want to look it up, it is fairly similar to cors header (except much more insecure)
[04:19:47] <Neo4> Cork: I only can get json from my server?
[04:20:02] <Neo4> Cork: second url called jsonp?
[04:20:04] <Cork> unless the server has support for setting cors headers or jsonp
[04:20:08] <Cork> ya
[04:20:20] <Neo4> I have never listened it
[04:20:30] <Cork> i would recommend looking for cors headers first
[04:20:39] <Cork> jsonp should be avoided unless you don't have a choice
[04:21:01] <Neo4> Cork: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_jsonp.asp ???
[04:21:18] <Cork> ugg -site:www.w3schools.com
[04:21:21] <Neo4> Cork: I can load it using curl
[04:21:28] <Cork> avoid that side as the plague
[04:21:31] <Cork> *site
[04:21:53] <Cork> Neo4: the block happens in the browser, so ya, as long as you don't run it on the clients computer it is fine
[04:22:14] <Cork> Neo4: the block is cause attackers could grab data from services _as the user_ if it wasn't
[04:22:30] <Cork> like your friends list from facebook or...
[04:22:39] <Neo4> Cork: you I can only load from there data using curl yes?
[04:22:44] <Cork> no
[04:22:51] <Neo4> Cork: why?
[04:23:01] <Cork> see my responses the last minute
[04:23:02] <Neo4> ajax doesn't work
[04:23:10] <Cork> i've just explained all this
[04:24:20] <Neo4> Cork: I badly understand what it means
[04:25:08] <Neo4> what the block and where happen? My browser blocks ajax. I see I can't solve it?
[04:25:30] <Cork> it means the browser blocks your request from returning unless the server says "the domain this request is coming from can safely access this resource, we have taken the precaution so user data isn't leaked
[04:26:00] <Cork> unless the server response with this, the browser assumes it isn't safe and blocks it
[04:26:47] <Neo4> it blocks because we can't get data from other domains?
[04:27:04] <Neo4> if it not jsonp?
[04:27:09] <Cork> no, it blocks cause it might leak user data
[04:27:32] <Cork> and jsonp like i've already said twice is one of two ways for the server to say it is safe
[04:27:45] <Cork> the modern way is cors headers, the old pre cors header solution is jsonp
[04:27:48] <Neo4> Cork: ok,  it will infinite block, and what shall I do? I can get that data using curl?
[04:28:04] <Cork> Neo4: you can proxy it over your own server
[04:28:14] <Cork> make it local to your own domain and things should work just fine
[04:28:17] <Neo4> Cork: cors I watched video about it, there for c#
[04:28:29] <Cork> uh...
[04:28:49] <Cork> Neo4: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
[04:29:01] <Cork> THAT is cors you prob want to read up on it
[04:29:17] <Neo4> Cork: oh it's bad solution this task cost 20$ I won't do server for grab IP, I rather cope that data manually
[04:29:27] <Cork> uh, what?
[04:29:48] * SirLagz hands Cork a 'bang head here' mousepad
[04:29:59] <Neo4> Cork: low budget, I couldn't do what you say, server is no, manyally copy 6 games and put in html
[04:30:06] <Cork> Neo4: you are most likely mixing this up with some other terms in #c that is completely unrelated...
[04:30:18] <Cork> uh.. opps *c#
[04:30:40] <Cork> can't say it jumps to the front of my mind what that would be though...
[04:30:41] <Neo4> Cork: relate, or C# or it was look like c# but not that was node.js
[04:31:03] <Cork> Neo4: cors and similar solutions doesn't cost a dime
[04:31:25] <Cork> but you _NEED_ to understand why this security restrictions are there
[04:31:42] <Neo4> Cork: https://www.codeschool.com/discuss/t/how-to-solve-no-access-control-allow-origin-header-is-present-on-the-requested-resource-origin-null-is-therefore-not-allowed-access-in-angular-js/28989/3
[04:32:01] <Cork> Neo4: read the link i provided
[04:32:20] <Cork> it will give you a no bull explanation about it
[04:38:05] <pj> If I do something like this: $("#something").data("foo").bar = "baz"; so that I'm modifying the object returned by a call to data, will it work and modify the object stored in the data itself or do I need to re-save the whole object with something like $("#something").data("foo", newObj)?
[04:39:21] <Cork> pj: it will modify it; as long as it exists
[04:39:52] <Cork> $().data('foo', {}); $().data('foo').key = 'val'; $().data('foo').key === 'val'
[04:40:25] <pj> Cork: thanks.
[04:40:32] <Cork> pj: .data() returns the value stored in it, and as objects are by reference in javascript you can modify the original
[04:40:46] <Cork> it is basically as simple as that
[04:41:10] <pj> yeah, that's what I thoguht, but I wasn't entirely sure it didn't do something like store the object as JSON or something that would end up actually making a deep copy when you retrieve it.
[04:41:55] <Cork> pj: the point of .data is to allow storing _anyting_ so it can't convert it to json
[04:42:05] <Cork> heck you can even do .data('foo', function() {});
[04:42:18] <Cork> or .data('foo', elm)
[04:42:37] <pj> Cork: cool.  the JSON thing is just something I end up having to do with localStorage so I wasn't entirely sure that data wasn't the same.
[04:43:06] <pj> anyways, you answered my question perfectly, thanks.
[04:43:12] <Cork> pj: ya, localstorage is storing cross page loads, and is a quite crappy api through and through
[04:43:51] <pj> yeah, well from what I could tell it only stores strings so to get it to store an entire object I end up just using JSON.stringify()
[04:44:01] <Cork> ya
[04:44:16] <Cork> localstorage and sessionstorage is only string value and string key storage
[04:44:49] <Cork> though my point of cross page loads is you can't ever store memory references in those
[04:45:17] <Cork> that is why you can't do it for webworkers either
[04:45:47] <pj> ahhh, I see.
[04:45:53] <pj> that makes sense.
[04:46:14] <Cork> ya
[05:01:34] <Neo4> Cork: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
[05:01:55] <Cork> Neo4: yes, like i said before
[05:02:00] <Neo4> it means on remote site should be header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'?
[05:02:09] <Neo4> Cork: I badly understand English
[05:02:23] <Cork> no, it means a remote site can't use that resource directly
[05:02:42] <Neo4> Cork: I need being said more one times
[05:03:14] <Cork> then read each line twice -_-'
[05:03:52] <Neo4> Cork: I've read if on remote site can be 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' I'd can red it?
[05:04:16] <Neo4> Cork: you said I can't get that site using javascript?
[05:04:26] <Neo4> only php or other
[05:04:48] <Cork> no, as the server doesn't say it is safe for _CLIENT SIDE REQUESTS_ to access it cross domain
[05:04:57] <Neo4> Cork: if server is api server it should be have that header?
[05:05:09] <pj> Neo4: google CORS
[05:05:20] <Cork> depends if it is meant to be accessed from javascript
[05:05:22] <Cork> many aren't
[05:05:31] <Neo4> Cork: ok, it not going to say that it is safe, what shall I do?
[05:05:49] <Neo4> Cork: direct download using ajax
[05:05:53] <Neo4> liek I did
[05:06:07] <Cork> you can't download using ajax -_-'
[05:06:25] <Neo4> as we can see it is impossible, unless like you say it is safe
[05:06:40] <Cork> what are you arguing about...
[05:06:56] <Neo4> Cork: well. you should have said it immediately
[05:07:04] <Neo4> Cork: no I agree
[05:07:25] <Neo4> pj: I badly understand what is that
[05:07:47] <Cork> you have four options: 1. check if it is an api meant to javascript access, 2. contact the provider and see if they are willing to provide such an api, 3. proxy it over your own server so it is not a client request
[05:07:51] <Cork> or 4. give up
[05:08:03] <Cork> there is no 5:th option
[05:08:50] <Neo4> Cork: or get that site using file_get_content()
[05:08:56] <Cork> ...
[05:09:04] <Cork> are you even reading what i'm saying?
[05:09:17] <Neo4> ok, in general better create like you said own proxy server
[05:09:25] <Neo4> Cork: I understand your idea
[05:09:31] <Neo4> Cork: understood*
[05:09:31] <Cork> no apparently not
[05:09:45] <Cork> cause file_get_content() would be a perfect example of 3
[05:09:52] <Neo4> Cork: why not? SEE I'll explain now
[05:11:51] <Neo4> Cork: see we create your own server = php script (my_domain.com/server.php) that will make direct request to that server and get data and return it with safe header. Then we'll be able to use our server for access data from any our javascript clients
[05:11:59] <Neo4> you meant this scheme
[05:12:19] <Cork> you don't even need a header
[05:12:28] <Cork> the header is only needed when you do cors
[05:12:56] <Neo4> our javascript codes (clients) -> my proxy server (php script with safe access) -> that server with data without safe access
[05:13:20] <Cork> it isn't "server without safe access"...
[05:13:35] <Cork> server without cors header: sure
[05:14:37] <Cork> some apis don't have cors headers cause they are meant for syncing state or something like that
[05:15:06] <Neo4> Cork: don't need if it use on the same domain, assume I created plugin and it will ported to other many sites, they will not able access my site. It is necessary put safe access on my and allow access for many.
[05:15:09] <Cork> and if they opened the api for direct website access they could be ddosed and not have a way to prevent it as each request comes from a separate ip
[05:15:26] <pj> do be aware that if the API provider is not returning CORS headers and refuses to add them then it is likely that they don't want their API accessed via Javascript.
[05:15:55] <Cork> ya, and if you expose it and data is leaked that isn't safe, it is on your hands
[05:16:01] <pj> any attempt to work around it such as using a proxy might be in violation of their service agreement.
[05:16:28] <Cork> but ya, that said, the proxy might just be banned for doing to many requests
[05:16:41] <Cork> if load is the reason they have the restriction; and it commonly are
[05:17:09] <Cork> having 10+ sites cross domain accessing an api for each time a page is loaded can take a lot of loads
[05:17:24] <Cork> s/take a lots/create a lots/
[05:19:10] <Neo4> Cork: yes, it for this there should be cash on request, something like this equal requests to do once in day or in a few hours....
[05:19:33] <Neo4> it doesn't matter, main it's we understood how it works :)
[05:20:05] <Neo4> I didn't know that for use javascript API we should give access
[05:20:16] * Cork vaguely wonder who we are
[05:20:38] <Neo4> Cork: ok, I understood, just we sound much better :)
[05:21:32] <Neo4> Cork: we are who understood it with me. Will consider )
[05:35:21] <fas3r> Hello
[05:37:30] <fas3r> How to attach an event to a button created from an extend function ? https://pastebin.com/LAk7mrY4  thanks
[05:40:08] <fas3r> should I just add a specific class and bind it ?
[05:41:45] <pj> fas3r: a class or id, or any other way you can access it with a selector.  The main thing to keep in mind is that you need to make sure that the button is actually created before you attempt to bind it to an event.
[05:42:26] <fas3r> pj: ok, I though that I could define the "click" function directly on the element as in pastebin.
[05:43:02] <fas3r> it's working if  put the function outside of $.fn.extend.
[05:43:08] <fas3r> thanks for the answer.

[10:12:46] <noairbag> it was working before with CODE: setInterval(function() {$("#div1").load("scenario");}, 20000);
[10:16:30] <Cork> noairbag: .load isn't depricated
[10:16:40] <Cork> and .on is an event handler not a network action
[10:17:10] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[10:25:41] <noairbag> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/ is listed depricated since 1.8
[10:28:16] <noairbag> using .load gives ERROR: TypeError: $(...).load is not a function
[10:29:38] <Cork> noairbag: ya, but that is EVENT you can't run "scenario" as a function
[10:30:25] <noairbag> scenario is a route. like http://website.com/scenario
[10:30:45] <noairbag> (apologies, not too good with this)
[10:31:06] <noairbag> also, it was working in older version of jquery
[10:32:48] <noairbag> how about this: i would like to load an html file every 10 sec in div id "div1"
[10:34:26] <noairbag> (actually, not a html file, but a route - e.g., webserver.com/scenario/)
[10:36:03] <Cork> ya, that is load not event
[10:36:08] <Cork> that is the first link i gave you
[10:37:12] <noairbag> ok. why do I get ERROR: TypeError: $(...).load is not a function
[10:39:11] <Cork> donno, $() isn't jquery?
[11:03:44] <devi8> is there an easy way to style jqueryUI to have the expand arrows appear after the labels instead of in front of them on the accordian styling?
[11:44:16] <carcrash> Hello, I have a very simple script
[11:44:18] <carcrash> $('select#make').change( new function(){ console.log("Select has changed"); });
[11:44:22] <carcrash> It fires properly once when the page loads, but every subsequent time it gives an error
[11:44:28] <carcrash> TypeError: (intermediate value).apply is not a function
[11:44:53] <carcrash> Does anyone know what might cause this? It is the only script on the page aside from bootstrap and jquery
[11:46:02] <Woet> carcrash: show your test case on www.jsfiddle.net
[12:01:16] <carcrash> Woet, https://jsfiddle.net/m5ewg4b2/
[12:01:21] <carcrash> There it is in action
[12:23:51] <Woet> carcrash: get rid of the "new"
[12:24:04] <Woet> i didn't see it when you pasted it here (because no syntax highlighting)
[12:24:06] <Woet> not sure which example gave you that
[12:26:33] <alberto_> Hello
[12:33:08] <MikeD_> $(myselect).find( "option:contains(" + displaytext + ")").prop('selected', true )  <-- is this ok?
[12:33:14] <Woet> MikeD_: try it.
[12:33:16] <Woet> and see.
[12:33:19] <MikeD_> i did
[12:33:26] <Woet> MikeD_: then you know whether it's ok or not
[12:33:49] <MikeD_> not exactly, there are things we can write that people in this channel might say "that's dumb, do it simpler"
[12:34:15] <Woet> i guess "ok" is ambiguous
[12:34:25] <Woet> but with just one line of code it's hard to say whether it can be done in a better way
[12:34:35] <taplar> i'd personally find the options, and then do a filter.  but that's me trying to avoid sizzle
[12:34:38] <MikeD_> the contains selector might not be "safe"
[12:36:25] <carcrash> Woet, Ah, thanks! that fixed it. I think that was a slip on my end accidentally added without thought.
[12:41:47] <MikeD_> taplar: such as: https://jsfiddle.net/mngahf2u/
[12:42:21] <taplar> yep, pretty much.  though i'd use this.innerHTML instead of the text() method
[12:43:08] <taplar> and if you know #foo should be a select you could do children() rather than the find
[12:44:21] <lissitzki> hi taplar
[12:44:26] <taplar> hola
[12:45:00] <MikeD_> that's what i was looking for, thanks.
[13:00:06] <hellyeah-tired> yo

[13:01:06] <lissitzki> trying a simple addClass on clicking a menu
[13:01:16] <lissitzki> i want the active page to change color
[13:01:26] <lissitzki> not sure how to show it in jsfiddle though
[13:03:13] <taplar> well first off, you don't need the method on line 3
[13:03:19] <taplar> you're already inside a document ready
[13:03:38] <taplar> $(function) is the same as $(document).ready(function)
[13:03:59] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/65cc2aps/4/
[13:04:10] <taplar> and $('children') doesn't make sense
[13:04:22] <lissitzki> at line 4
[13:04:42] <taplar> yeah, and below.  children isn't a valid tagName
[13:04:53] <taplar> which is what the selector 'children' is looking for
[13:05:18] <taplar> if you meant to use the variable children, don't put it in quotes
[13:05:28] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/65cc2aps/5/
[13:05:33] <taplar> and it's already a jquery object so you don't have to put it inside $()
[13:05:59] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/65cc2aps/6/
[13:06:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/65cc2aps/7/

[13:07:46] <lissitzki> cool
[13:13:05] <hellyeah-tired> i cannot send decimal number to the backend. Is it possible that can be related with ajax?
[13:13:26] <taplar> how are you sending the data?
[13:13:39] <taplar> by that i mean in what format?
[13:13:45] <lissitzki> on on site is not working
[13:13:47] <lissitzki> :(
[13:14:01] <lissitzki> i'll try a console.log
[13:14:11] <taplar> :D
[13:14:21] <hellyeah-tired> json
[13:14:40] <taplar> then yeah you should be able to send decimal numbers
[13:15:22] <lissitzki> it maybe the other script on the menu acting in a way that the addClass is not working?
[13:16:00] <taplar> lissitzki: i couldn't really say without seeing it
[13:16:32] <taplar> you said you want the color to change?
[13:17:34] <hellyeah-tired> taplar,  this is my ajax http://dpaste.com/04SERQE
[13:18:15] <taplar> what does the result of JSON.stringify(monitor) look like?
[13:18:44] <hellyeah-tired> sec
[13:20:25] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/e2zvr147/15/ this is the first fiddle
[13:20:33] <lissitzki> acting on the menu
[13:20:46] <hellyeah-tired> taplar,  http://dpaste.com/3T8KRKJ
[13:21:16] <taplar> which one is the desired decimal key?
[13:21:45] <hellyeah-tired> just a sec
[13:22:28] <hellyeah-tired> sorry
[13:22:33] <hellyeah-tired> http://dpaste.com/087WJ35 here CVP
[13:22:59] <taplar> see the quotes around the value?  it's sending it across as a stirng
[13:23:00] <taplar> *string
[13:23:27] <taplar> lissitzki: right, but that fiddle doesn't do anything with a color, which I thought that was your first question?
[13:23:51] <lissitzki> yes
[13:24:16] <hellyeah-tired> right
[13:24:17] <hellyeah-tired> well
[13:24:27] <lissitzki> ok, then i'll console.log(myActive.length)?
[13:24:28] <hellyeah-tired> taplar,  json.stringify make it string
[13:24:45] <hellyeah-tired> do i need json.parse?
[13:26:10] <taplar> afaik, if you want to force it to be sent across as a decimal, you're going to have to construct the object that you stringify yourself and make it a decimal.
[13:26:22] <hellyeah-tired> i just saw the usage like that
[13:26:41] <lissitzki> .length it works...
[13:26:44] <hellyeah-tired> ajax transform to json afaik
[13:27:16] <hellyeah-tired> object stringify itself?
[13:27:39] <hellyeah-tired> what about toString()
[13:28:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/m2Lo3odf/
[13:28:31] <taplar> If the object you stringify has a numerial value, it will not put it in quotes
[13:31:33] <hellyeah-tired> taplar,  like that http://dpaste.com/1RKM9HW
[13:31:54] <taplar> yep
[13:32:34] <hellyeah-tired> I see
[13:33:54] <hellyeah-tired> hmm
[13:33:59] <hellyeah-tired> seems that worked
[13:34:03] <hellyeah-tired> let me be sure
[13:35:18] <hellyeah-tired> thanks taplar
[13:35:31] <taplar> sure
[13:36:17] <hellyeah-tired> you did teach me one more thing
[13:39:34] <lissitzki> taplar, can you suggest me which console.log i can use to check th problem with changing the color?
[13:39:58] <hellyeah-tired> you want to change color of th
[13:40:00] <hellyeah-tired> ?
[13:40:19] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/65cc2aps/8/
[13:40:31] <lissitzki> here the code is working but not in the site
[13:41:46] <lissitzki> the console.log('$myActive'.length) is giving me results, so it is working but somehow the addClass is not
[13:41:50] <hellyeah-tired> what console says?
[13:42:04] <taplar> console.log('$myActive'.length) ?
[13:42:11] <lissitzki> giving a number
[13:42:19] <hellyeah-tired> .length need to be in outside of paranthesis
[13:42:24] <taplar> ok, you've did this a few times so i'm going to have to poke at you a bit
[13:42:37] <hellyeah-tired> mena how did you get any result with that
[13:42:45] <taplar> if you want to use something as a variable, -do not- put it in quotes
[13:43:01] <taplar> '$myActive' is a string, not a reference to the variable $myActive
[13:43:02] <hellyeah-tired> console.log($('.selector').length);
[13:43:16] <taplar> if you do a length off of that it will return 9, as that is the string length
[13:43:29] <taplar> do you understand that?
[13:44:01] <lissitzki> ok
[13:44:05] <lissitzki> infact it was 9
[13:44:07] <lissitzki> console.log($myActive).length
[13:44:15] <lissitzki> giving other result
[13:44:22] <taplar> so what does that command do?
[13:44:44] <lissitzki> TypeError console.log(...) is undefined
[13:45:02] <taplar> console.log() takes whatever you put inside the () and writes it to the console of the browser
[13:45:03] <lissitzki> counting how many elemnts are
[13:45:17] <robertmaxrees>  console.log($myActive).length isn't going to work btw.,
[13:45:31] <robertmaxrees> console.log(/* your code here */);
[13:45:49] <hellyeah-tired> dude
[13:46:00] <hellyeah-tired> lissitzki,  check what i wrote above :D
[13:46:29] <lissitzki> hellyeah-tired, you said .length outside the brackets
[13:46:42] <robertmaxrees> for the selector.
[13:46:54] <taplar> yeah, the statement was ambiguous
[13:47:12] <hellyeah-tired> sorry for my english
[13:47:14] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to log out the results of $('someselector').length
[13:47:15] <lissitzki> it was about the ;?
[13:47:32] <robertmaxrees> so you have to pass that entire statement to the console.log()
[13:47:34] <hellyeah-tired> you should use .length right after closing paranthesis of selector
[13:47:44] <hellyeah-tired> taplar,  is it more clear now? :D
[13:48:05] <lissitzki> ok
[13:48:07] <taplar> idk, i feel like we're three manning this guy right now.  i'm going to turn it over to robert and step away
[13:48:15] <robertmaxrees> heh, sorry.
[13:48:16] <robertmaxrees> i'll stfu.
[13:48:30] <taplar> nah, didn't mean it like that
[13:49:01] <lissitzki> anyway TypeError: console.log(...) is undefined
[13:49:11] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?>
[13:49:11] <lissitzki> console.log($myActive).length;
[13:49:14] <hellyeah-tired> :D
[13:49:14] <lissitzki> firefox
[13:49:17] <robertmaxrees> again
[13:49:22] <robertmaxrees> console.log($myActive).length isn't what you want.
[13:49:26] <hellyeah-tired> dude select the element
[13:49:35] <hellyeah-tired> what is $myActive
[13:49:36] <lissitzki> ah yeah
[13:51:12] <lissitzki> $myActive is my selector
[13:51:36] <hellyeah-tired> $myActive could be variable
[13:51:39] <robertmaxrees> is it the selected elements, or is it a string?
[13:51:52] <hellyeah-tired> var $myActive = $('.selector');
[13:52:03] <lissitzki>  var $myActive = $('#myyenu > li > h4 > a');
[13:52:25] <robertmaxrees> okay. that doesn't really change much.
[13:52:26] <lissitzki> it is the selected elements
[13:52:39] <hellyeah-tired> okay you have error in console.log
[13:52:43] <robertmaxrees> you'd just pass $myActive.length instead of $('someselector').length
[13:52:45] <hellyeah-tired> find tit
[13:52:52] <lissitzki> sorry i'll come back in 15 min
[13:53:09] <lissitzki> thanks btw
[13:55:37] <hellyeah-tired> robertmaxrees,  i am sorry for interrupting ou
[13:55:39] <hellyeah-tired> you
[13:57:26] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i was just trying to interject some salient stuff.
[13:58:13] <hellyeah-tired> salient is a nice word
[13:58:59] <robertmaxrees> taplar+++++ for being a patient dude.
[13:59:04] <robertbusy> and now i work.
[13:59:25] <taplar> :)
[14:01:54] <taplar> heh, idrc who helps the dude.  i just didn't want to swamp the guy
[14:05:06] <robertbusy> yeah def.
[14:05:46] <hellyeah-tired> irrc?
[14:06:00] <hellyeah-tired> idrc?
[14:06:04] <hellyeah-tired> swamp the guy
[14:06:06] <hellyeah-tired> hmm
[14:06:17] <hellyeah-tired> i dont know those one anyway
[14:07:47] <robertbusy> idrc = I don't really care.
[14:08:03] <robertbusy> "swamp the guy" is inundating with too much stuff at once.
[14:08:47] <hellyeah-tired> ah
[14:08:54] <hellyeah-tired> like press someone too much
[14:08:58] <hellyeah-tired> is it?
[14:09:11] <robertbusy> to "press" implies you're trying to get something out of them.
[14:09:20] <robertbusy> "press" is similar to "squeeze" in that case.
[14:09:49] <robertbusy> you know how sometimes you have a TON of work to do and it's feeling like you're overly busy?
[14:11:21] <hellyeah-tired> overwhelming yes
[14:11:46] <hellyeah-tired> i understand i guess
[14:12:01] <robertbusy> english speakers will sometimes decribe that as saying "i'm swamped at work"
[14:13:16] <hellyeah-tired> aha
[14:13:20] <hellyeah-tired> hmm
[14:13:32] <hellyeah-tired> when you say swamped
[14:13:39] <hellyeah-tired> i remember the song of Lacuna Coil
[14:14:42] <lissitzki> hi
[14:14:44] <lissitzki> i'm back
[14:15:06] <lissitzki> so you told me that I was doing a console.log wrong

[14:15:17] <hellyeah-tired> lissitzki,  yeah
[14:15:25] <hellyeah-tired> you are selecting element thats fine
[14:15:40] <hellyeah-tired> the point you need to focus on is to get length of selector right
[14:15:57] <hellyeah-tired> console.log($('.selector)).length you wrote
[14:16:14] <lissitzki> ok
[14:16:16] <hellyeah-tired> i am sure you can see what is false here easily
[14:16:33] <hellyeah-tired> you want to get length of console.log?
[14:16:41] <hellyeah-tired> or you want to get length of selector?
[14:16:50] <lissitzki> clearly selector
[14:17:02] <hellyeah-tired> okey you need to do simple fix
[14:17:07] <hellyeah-tired> think about it
[14:17:12] <lissitzki> console.log($(''selector).length)
[14:17:18] <hellyeah-tired> yeah thats it
[14:18:09] <lissitzki> length is 0
[14:18:31] <hellyeah-tired> okey then element does not exist
[14:18:39] <hellyeah-tired> oh
[14:18:50] <hellyeah-tired> i am sorry
[14:19:05] <hellyeah-tired> console.log($mySelector.length);
[14:19:11] <hellyeah-tired> think little bit man D:
[14:19:57] <lissitzki> gett confused
[14:20:21] <lissitzki>  console.log($myActive.length) or  console.log($('myActive').length);?
[14:20:48] <lissitzki> i thouht .length goes out of brackets
[14:20:57] <robertbusy> lissitzki well
[14:21:11] <robertbusy> lilalinux $myActive is set to $('.myActive') right?
[14:21:23] <robertbusy> errr, woops.
[14:21:25] <robertbusy> lissitzki
[14:21:27] <lilalinux> ;-)
[14:21:38] <robertbusy> :B
[14:22:11] <lissitzki> robertbusy, no
[14:22:18] <robertbusy> what is $myActive set to then?
[14:22:21] <lissitzki> var $myActive = $('#menu > li > h4 > a');
[14:22:26] <robertbusy> errr, right.
[14:22:33] <hellyeah-tired> $myActive.length
[14:22:44] <lissitzki> ok
[14:22:48] <lissitzki> now i got it
[14:22:55] <robertbusy> make sense now?
[14:23:39] <lissitzki> yes, but still got the problem
[14:23:55] <hellyeah-tired> length is 0 :D
[14:23:58] <lissitzki> that is making my code https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/65cc2aps/8/ working on my site
[14:23:59] <hellyeah-tired> ?
[14:24:05] <lissitzki> no lenght is 10
[14:24:18] <lissitzki> but my menu has 5 elements
[14:25:05] <robertbusy> so the fiddle is right but your site is still broken?
[14:25:13] <lissitzki> yup
[14:25:26] <robertbusy> are you pasting the rendered html from the inspector?
[14:25:37] <hellyeah-tired> dude
[14:25:41] <hellyeah-tired> fix your click
[14:25:46] <iffraff> hi, I am trying to select an element inside a modal popup ( not jquery ) when I look at elements in dev tools it is clearly all decending children.  However, I can select the element containing the modal, but not the modal element.  am I missing something?
[14:26:08] <robertbusy> iffraff what do you mean "but not the modal element"?
[14:26:41] <lissitzki> wrong version: check this https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/65cc2aps/9/
[14:27:00] <iffraff> well, when you look at the dom, in dev tools, it's div -> div -> div etc I can select one div, but not it's child which happens to contain the modal
[14:27:10] <robertbusy> lissitzki something is obviously different between the fiddle and your site.
[14:27:16] <hellyeah-tired> it showed 3
[14:27:32] <lissitzki> yes my site has twig involved
[14:27:36] <robertbusy> iffraff i'm lost heh - is it becauise the child element ins't there oooorrrrr...?
[14:27:38] <lissitzki> can't put on fiddle
[14:27:45] <robertbusy> lissitzki i just need the rendered markup.
[14:27:52] <robertbusy> otherwise, we're flying bling.
[14:27:54] <robertbusy> *blind
[14:28:22] <iffraff> robertbusy: no, it is there.  clearly, jquery returns length of 0
[14:28:36] <robertbusy> iffraff
[14:28:39] <robertbusy> woops -
[14:28:57] <robertbusy> yeah, I'd need to see a fiddle.
[14:29:12] <robertbusy> because what you're describing seems off.
[14:30:08] <lissitzki> robertbusy, ok i  never did that
[14:30:17] <lissitzki> from console, right?
[14:30:37] <robertbusy> lissitzki your dev tools, yeah.
[14:32:11] <lissitzki> is this one, right? https://pastebin.com/zAfX4hCf
[14:32:42] <robertbusy> there's some invalid markup in there.
[14:33:09] <robertbusy> you don't want the stuff from when you hit "view source" on the page.
[14:33:15] <iffraff> I think I see what's going on, I'm using cypress.io and all of it's commands are promises, so when I call $ it's executed immeadiately, not in the sequential order
[14:33:17] <robertbusy> you want the stuff from your developer tools "elements" panel.
[14:33:54] <robertbusy> iffraff ah, so the elements don't exist when you try to select them?
[14:34:46] <iffraff> yea, I guess, I assumed it would fire sequentially.  my bad
[14:34:55] <robertbusy> funky.
[14:40:19] <lissitzki> robertbusy, https://pastebin.com/wWXPCebU ?
[14:47:04] <robertbusy> okay so first off.
[14:47:08] <robertbusy> <ul id="menu" class=""> - that's not valid.
[14:47:14] <robertbusy> can't repeat IDs
[14:48:32] <robertbusy> second off - that's a really strange markup structure.
[14:48:40] <robertbusy> why do you have a bunch of ULs with a single LI?
[14:49:29] <lissitzki> let me see
[14:50:04] <lissitzki> because there is a for loop
[14:50:34] <robertbusy> lol
[14:50:38] <robertbusy> but why that output?
[14:50:53] <robertbusy> also: that html doesn't have the problems you're describing.,
[14:50:56] <robertbusy> so something is way off.
[14:51:48] <lissitzki> how can i debug it
[14:54:15] <lissitzki> https://pastebin.com/5Gp3LZnx i adjust my ul li structure
[14:58:21] <robertbusy> lissitzki https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/urd2643f/
[14:58:24] <robertbusy> still only getting 5.
[14:58:30] <robertbusy> not sure where you're getting 20 with that.
[14:58:35] <lissitzki> 10
[14:59:23] <robertbusy> or 10.
[14:59:28] <robertbusy> anything other than 5.
[15:00:32] <lissitzki> mmh
[15:00:35] <lissitzki> no idea
[15:04:20] <lissitzki> i add another page and it calculate 12
[15:04:31] <lissitzki> so every elemnt it calculate for two
[15:04:39] <robertbusy> how are you adding things?
[15:05:00] <lissitzki> it is a folder with a .md file
[15:05:08] <robertbusy> and in your code?
[15:05:28] <robertbusy> something is duplicating - the JS is just reading what's there.
[15:05:54] <lissitzki> https://pastebin.com/hd6aNW9h
[15:06:05] <lissitzki> this is the code that makes the menu
[15:06:35] <robertbusy> (shrug) not familiar with that syntax.
[15:07:13] <lissitzki> ok, but the duplicating can be a problem for the addclass and removeclass action?
[15:08:01] <robertbusy> aye.
[15:09:14] <lissitzki> well i have another jquery functioning on the menu, it also calculate double elements and it is working
[15:10:22] <robertbusy> (shrug) it's super hard to help when you can't replicate the issue elsewhere heh.
[15:11:57] <loa> Hello. If somehow setting attribute "data" of element can lead to problems?
[15:12:20] <taplar> loa: can you elaborate on your question?
[15:15:07] <loa> taplar, i have strange situation that other person output debug info to data attribute, and somehow on one machine this data is sended like value. So he did jus $().attr('data'). So i am sking can this be a problem?
[15:15:37] <taplar> If you are going to change data attributes, you need to do it in a uniform manner
[15:15:53] <taplar> either you always get/set them with attr() or you always get/set them with data()
[15:16:20] <taplar> because data() keeps an internal cache that does not update the underlying attribute
[15:16:29] <loa> I am only about attribute data, which i never seen before. Not about something like data-json
[15:16:44] <taplar> you mean an attribute called just "data"?
[15:16:48] <loa> Yes
[15:17:20] <taplar> i'm not familiar if that is a valid attribute on elements
[15:17:35] <loa> I don't think, can this lead to problems?
[15:18:12] <taplar> I mean, if you are going to store information in the DOM, it would seem to make sense to me that you'd do it in a way that the DOM expects.
[15:19:07] <taplar> ok, data is a valid attribute, but only on objects
[15:19:15] <taplar> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#attr-object-data
[15:21:39] <lissitzki> i semplied the html structure
[15:24:37] <lissitzki> i'm giving u for today
[15:24:41] <lissitzki> up
[15:35:39] <hellyeah-tired> hey
[15:35:45] <hellyeah-tired> what did i do wrong here https://jsfiddle.net/6L3m02xg/3/
[15:36:24] <taplar> what have you done to debug it?
[15:37:00] <taplar> And please when you ask about some code, tell us what you are expecting.  "what did I do wrong" doesn't tell us what you are expecting to happen that is not happening.
[15:38:15] <hellyeah-tired> i put debugger
[15:38:39] <hellyeah-tired> i just try to replace empty string
[15:38:43] <hellyeah-tired> wen i see null
[15:39:01] <hellyeah-tired> thats it
[15:40:50] <hellyeah-tired> should i use other method?
[15:41:43] <hellyeah-tired> i determined the null
[15:42:12] <taplar> you put debugger where?
[15:43:05] <hellyeah-tired> between map and if
[15:43:19] <taplar> ok, and what did you look at?
[15:43:29] <hellyeah-tired> well
[15:43:32] <hellyeah-tired> the value of element
[15:43:50] <hellyeah-tired> when element is null i goes into if
[15:44:01] <hellyeah-tired> but i think element.replace is wrong method here
[15:44:08] <taplar> ok, so then what does the if logic do?
[15:44:30] <hellyeah-tired> logic is supposed to do replace "" instead of null
[15:45:00] <taplar> what does element.replace(null, ""); do?
[15:45:21] <hellyeah-tired> afaik it replaces "" to null value
[15:45:27] <hellyeah-tired> re-place
[15:45:32] <taplar> no, you got it backwards
[15:45:33] <hellyeah-tired> i mean re-locate the value
[15:45:47] <taplar> it would replace null with empty string
[15:45:47] <hellyeah-tired> replace("", null) ?
[15:45:55] <hellyeah-tired> dang
[15:45:58] <limpc> hello.
[15:46:06] <taplar> hold on hold on
[15:46:15] <taplar> are you trying to replace null with empty string, or empty string with null?
[15:46:48] <hellyeah-tired> empty string to position that includes null values
[15:47:00] <limpc> i have a tr row that has a mousedown event on it.  but I added a couple of form elements to the row, so I'm now trying to figure out how to get click events on those form elements instead of the tr element.
[15:47:02] <taplar> so you want to replace null with empty string
[15:47:04] <hellyeah-tired> ncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of null this is the error
[15:47:09] <hellyeah-tired> yeah
[15:47:15] <taplar> so question
[15:47:28] <taplar> how can a string "contain" null?
[15:47:54] <hellyeah-tired> "" means empty string
[15:48:00] <hellyeah-tired> string cannot contain null
[15:48:00] <taplar> that wasn't my question
[15:48:06] <taplar> right
[15:48:15] <hellyeah-tired> oh
[15:48:24] <hellyeah-tired> replace is string method right
[15:48:29] <taplar> yup
[15:48:33] <hellyeah-tired> it doesnt work for null values
[15:48:37] <taplar> nope
[15:48:37] <hellyeah-tired> okay
[15:48:39] <hellyeah-tired> hmm
[15:48:51] <taplar> null has no methods
[15:48:53] <hellyeah-tired> there must be some generic replace method
[15:48:54] <taplar> it's null
[15:49:05] <hellyeah-tired> eh
[15:49:08] <hellyeah-tired> hmm
[15:49:27] <limpc> val = (val == null) ? "":val;
[15:49:34] <hellyeah-tired> then i have to remove null
[15:49:52] <taplar> you already have your if check
[15:50:02] <taplar> you know it's null inside that if
[15:50:31] <hellyeah-tired> yes
[15:50:48] <taplar> so you'd set the key to the value of "" in that case
[15:51:35] <taplar> but
[15:51:40] <taplar> how do you know what the key is?
[15:52:34] <hellyeah-tired> key?
[15:52:38] <hellyeah-tired> i set values
[15:52:47] <taplar> you are going through the values of an object
[15:53:01] <taplar> if the value is null, you are wanting to replace it in the object
[15:53:07] <taplar> to do that, you have to know which key had that null value
[15:53:50] <hellyeah-tired> nice
[15:53:51] <hellyeah-tired> i did it
[15:54:30] <hellyeah-tired> is this correct approach? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/6L3m02xg/4/
[15:55:05] <taplar> no
[15:55:34] <taplar> isn't the desired end result the same object you started with, but without null values?
[15:56:05] <hellyeah-tired> yes
[15:56:11] <taplar> is that what you console logged?
[15:56:56] <hellyeah-tired> there is ""
[15:57:07] <hellyeah-tired> hmm
[15:57:09] <hellyeah-tired> i guess not
[15:57:20] <hellyeah-tired> i just want to see nothing on the screen
[15:57:29] <hellyeah-tired> probably i will see "" on the table
[15:57:37] <taplar> so fix your code
[15:58:08] <hellyeah-tired> i get Object.values
[15:58:22] <hellyeah-tired> to check null values on the value part of object
[15:58:36] <hellyeah-tired> but you said you need key part right?
[15:58:58] <taplar> how else would you replace part of an object?
[15:59:19] <catbadger> taplar replace the whole object with an updated one?
[15:59:31] <catbadger> as in how to replace part of an immutable object
[15:59:40] <taplar> it's not immutable
[15:59:47] <catbadger> well it's still a way ;)
[16:00:04] <taplar> which that should be asked.  are you wanting a new object without the null values, or to change the original?
[16:00:24] <catbadger> that seems like an important question
[16:00:25] <hellyeah-tired> change the original
[16:00:39] <taplar> yeah, so you are just wanting to update the original
[16:00:49] <hellyeah-tired> yeah sure
[16:01:00] <hellyeah-tired> i dont need to create extra object
[16:01:57] <catbadger> OK... todays nightmare goes like this... to force download files in browser, we rely on creating a form in memory that posts to our API using the submit() function... in all browsers but edge, error messages are caught and displayed... in Edge, the browser downloads api.json as a file... wtf ms?
[16:04:53] <taplar> what content type are you putting on the response for the file?
[16:05:20] <catbadger> application/son
[16:05:23] <catbadger> application/json
[16:05:41] <taplar> if you want to force a download, there's another you should most likely be using.  i need to google for it though
[16:06:11] <catbadger> yeah, problem is we need to bounce the attempt to get the file off the API to trigger the error that is retrieved by a subsequent call using session id
[16:06:52] <catbadger> all other browsers just fail the attempt silently...
[16:06:55] <taplar> you could conditionally set that header
[16:07:14] <catbadger> you mean the content type header?
[16:07:15] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7263923/how-to-force-file-download-with-php  the content-disposition is it i believe
[16:07:38] <catbadger> helpful. tyvm taplar.
[16:07:43] <taplar> yup
[16:08:41] <hellyeah-tired> i dont know
[16:09:08] <taplar> hellyeah-tired: So start by saying in plain english, what it is you want to do
[16:09:35] <hellyeah-tired> my object include some null values i want to change null to empty string
[16:09:52] <hellyeah-tired> for that i am mapping the object and check if there is null values
[16:10:01] <taplar> So, elaborate that sentence and say how you would change the values
[16:10:21] <hellyeah-tired> i should replace empty string to null values
[16:10:30] <taplar> elaborate the sentence
[16:10:32] <taplar> say how
[16:11:01] <hellyeah-tired> can you give me some tipes?
[16:11:05] <hellyeah-tired> tips?
[16:11:14] <taplar> think it through
[16:11:17] <taplar> you got an object
[16:11:22] <taplar> how do you change values of an object?
[16:11:50] <hellyeah-tired> Object.values(obj) i dont have a object here actually
[16:11:56] <taplar> that's code
[16:11:59] <taplar> plain english
[16:12:05] <taplar> how do you change values of an object?
[16:12:16] <hellyeah-tired> by assigning something
[16:12:19] <taplar> how?
[16:12:27] <hellyeah-tired> var x = y;
[16:12:34] <taplar> that's code
[16:13:11] <hellyeah-tired> i can assign another values to my object
[16:13:15] <taplar> how?
[16:13:31] <hellyeah-tired> my english is not enough
[16:13:42] <taplar> what are the parts of an object?
[16:13:48] <hellyeah-tired> by equalizing one to other
[16:13:59] <hellyeah-tired> key/value
[16:14:02] <taplar> ok
[16:14:10] <hellyeah-tired> is that correct?
[16:14:12] <taplar> so using those parts, how do you change an object?
[16:15:21] <hellyeah-tired> hmm
[16:15:27] <hellyeah-tired> you want sentence right
[16:15:31] <taplar> yep
[16:15:52] <hellyeah-tired> i equalize key to something
[16:16:01] <hellyeah-tired> object to another thing
[16:16:10] <hellyeah-tired> not sure equalize ÅŸs a word
[16:16:13] <hellyeah-tired> is*
[16:16:26] <taplar> equalize works.  "assign" or "set" also work
[16:16:38] <hellyeah-tired> good
[16:16:40] <taplar> so now, take that and elaborate on your sentence on what you are wanting to do
[16:17:03] <hellyeah-tired> some of values of my object is null
[16:17:18] <lissitzki> guys i've some hints about my issue
[16:17:20] <hellyeah-tired> i want to change those null to empty string
[16:17:28] <taplar> how?
[16:17:40] <hellyeah-tired> for that issue i have to assign something to value part of object
[16:17:48] <lissitzki> if console.log($("mySelector").length), length is correct
[16:17:50] <hellyeah-tired> like element == emptystring;
[16:17:58] <hellyeah-tired> =*
[16:18:03] <taplar> elaborate.  how do you know which ones to change?
[16:18:05] <lissitzki> if console.log($myVar.length), length is doubled
[16:18:26] <hellyeah-tired> i am checking for null values taplar
[16:18:31] <hellyeah-tired> with if
[16:18:32] <taplar> that's not a sentence
[16:18:42] <taplar> elaborate your statement of what you want to do
[16:19:17] <hellyeah-tired> , want to check null values and when i find it i want to change it to empty string
[16:19:29] <taplar> how do you find null values?
[16:19:39] <taplar> and how do you change it?
[16:19:52] <hellyeah-tired> by iterating object with object.values
[16:20:07] <hellyeah-tired> that takes the value part of object and iterate it
[16:20:30] <taplar> why the value part?
[16:21:01] <hellyeah-tired> taplar,  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/6L3m02xg/6/
[16:21:11] <hellyeah-tired> because value par is visible on table
[16:21:11] <taplar> dude
[16:21:15] <taplar> you have a logic flaw
[16:21:18] <hellyeah-tired> part*
[16:21:21] <taplar> i'm trying to force you to recognise it
[16:21:52] <hellyeah-tired> understand there is something with key part
[16:22:01] <hellyeah-tired> buÄ±t i am not sure it is really necessary
[16:22:02] <taplar> ok, so think more about that
[16:22:10] <hellyeah-tired> hmm
[16:22:21] <taplar> you're talking about an object.  keys are an essential part of them
[16:22:31] <hellyeah-tired> yes
[16:22:38] <taplar> so why would they be unnecessary?
[16:22:39] <hellyeah-tired> keys are never empty
[16:22:51] <hellyeah-tired> because key cannot be empty
[16:23:01] <hellyeah-tired> it is like describer
[16:23:02] <taplar> what is a key?
[16:23:10] <taplar> not a describer
[16:23:15] <taplar> it's the variale
[16:23:19] <taplar> *variable
[16:23:20] <hellyeah-tired> variable
[16:23:22] <hellyeah-tired> hmm
[16:23:25] <hellyeah-tired> okay
[16:23:27] <taplar> it's the thing you are trying to change
[16:23:32] <hellyeah-tired> variable/content
[16:24:42] <hellyeah-tired> okay i have key part with Object.keys
[16:25:39] <hellyeah-tired> anyway need to sleep
[16:25:44] <hellyeah-tired> i dont know right now
[16:26:08] <taplar> you're starting to go down the right path
[16:26:37] <hellyeah-tired> hm
[16:26:49] <catbadger> headers had no effect.
[16:26:57] <taplar> :(
[16:27:23] <hellyeah-tired> not sure about that https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/6L3m02xg/7/
[16:28:10] <taplar> you said you have the keys with Object.keys()
[16:28:49] <hellyeah-tired> key is never empty
[16:29:04] <taplar> i don't understand why you keep saying that
[16:29:22] <hellyeah-tired> key is never null
[16:29:28] <taplar> nope. so?
[16:29:30] <hellyeah-tired> i have to check smt against null
[16:29:34] <hellyeah-tired> right
[16:29:35] <taplar> yep
[16:29:51] <hellyeah-tired> well
[16:29:54] <taplar> what do you have to check against null though?
[16:30:28] <hellyeah-tired> Object.keys(element) just gave me string
[16:30:40] <taplar> that is going to give you an array of the key strings
[16:31:09] <hellyeah-tired> not make sense to check array of key against null
[16:31:19] <taplar> where does the null come from?
[16:31:20] <hellyeah-tired> but check array of values do
[16:31:24] <taplar> no
[16:31:28] <hellyeah-tired> hm
[16:31:34] <taplar> where does the null come from?
[16:31:43] <hellyeah-tired> null comes from value part?
[16:31:48] <taplar> of?
[16:31:56] <hellyeah-tired> key
[16:32:06] <taplar> and you have an array of keys
[16:33:35] <hellyeah-tired> does it make sense? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/6L3m02xg/8/
[16:34:00] <taplar> Can you say in words what you should be doing now?
[16:34:11] <hellyeah-tired> well
[16:34:28] <hellyeah-tired> i just access the value part of obj
[16:34:48] <hellyeah-tired> i have all keys
[16:34:55] <hellyeah-tired> so i can look them up
[16:35:03] <hellyeah-tired> false?
[16:35:10] <taplar> that is true
[16:35:30] <hellyeah-tired> obj[element] that is i have right now
[16:35:52] <hellyeah-tired> obj is an object but i am pretending like it is array
[16:35:57] <hellyeah-tired> am i doing wrong?
[16:35:59] <taplar> i'm not interested in the code right now.  i want you to say what you should be doing
[16:36:11] <hellyeah-tired> okay
[16:36:12] <taplar> if you can say in words what you should do, it's a simple thing to write it in code
[16:36:30] <hellyeah-tired> okay
[16:36:36] <hellyeah-tired> basically i am traversin object
[16:36:49] <hellyeah-tired> and check value of key is null or not
[16:36:54] <hellyeah-tired> plain simple it seems
[16:37:05] <hellyeah-tired> ah
[16:37:13] <hellyeah-tired> well
[16:37:21] <hellyeah-tired> i start understanding something
[16:37:37] <hellyeah-tired> i just pretend object like an array
[16:37:48] <hellyeah-tired> so i can use array method and push empty string
[16:37:52] <taplar> no
[16:37:52] <hellyeah-tired> is that correct?
[16:37:55] <hellyeah-tired> hm
[16:37:59] <hellyeah-tired> just trie
[16:38:00] <hellyeah-tired> d
[16:38:02] <taplar> an object is not an array
[16:38:25] <taplar> you've already said, i believe, how to set a value on an object
[16:38:37] <taplar> and it has nothing to do with arrays
[16:38:44] <hellyeah-tired> it is still object
[16:38:58] <hellyeah-tired> by assigining
[16:39:11] <taplar> yes
[16:39:24] <taplar> so say it all together now
[16:40:11] <hellyeah-tired> hmm
[16:40:49] <hellyeah-tired> i can access value part of key of object and assign empty object or something obj[element].
[16:41:15] <taplar> yes
[16:41:42] <hellyeah-tired> i did that https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/6L3m02xg/10/
[16:41:58] <hellyeah-tired>  i am sure it is wrong
[16:41:59] <hellyeah-tired> :D
[16:42:23] <taplar> then compare it to your statement of what you should be doing, and see where it is different
[16:42:35] <taplar> that's the whole reason i've been trying to get you to say it
[16:43:02] <taplar> if you do not understand what it is you should be doing, making it in code is a much harder thing to do
[16:43:14] <taplar> cause if you don't know what you need, how can you do it?
[16:43:27] <hellyeah-tired> well thats the last step
[16:44:03] <hellyeah-tired> i really dont know what to assign

[16:44:34] <taplar> all i did was add the console log of 'obj'
[16:44:52] <hellyeah-tired> i did that
[16:45:06] <taplar> so look at what it logs
[16:46:15] <hellyeah-tired> okay
[16:46:17] <hellyeah-tired> i checked
[16:46:32] <hellyeah-tired> i am confused
[16:46:38] <taplar> about?
[16:46:54] <merkazu> hello, could someone please look at this: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VyRRPo and tell me why the video isn't playing when the button is clicked on? the <source> tag gets populated correctly
[16:46:57] <hellyeah-tired> which one is desirable output
[16:47:08] <taplar> lol, you tell me.  it's your code man
[16:47:12] <taplar> you know what you want
[16:47:16] <hellyeah-tired> :D
[16:47:26] <hellyeah-tired> second output seems correct

[16:48:45] <hellyeah-tired> let me sleep on it
[16:48:56] <hellyeah-tired> tomorrow is work day
[16:51:19] <taplar> merkazu: not sure, the network request looks like it's stuck in pending.  but it could be my network too
[16:51:33] <merkazu> i'm wondering if it's an issue with youtube
[16:51:58] <merkazu> i think there's a fair bit of embed busting and whatnot if you don't do things the youtube way
[16:52:12] <merkazu> which involves iframes... ew
[16:53:07] <duch_kazatel> that's actually not all that bad imo.
[16:53:18] <duch_kazatel> keeps 'em sandboxed.
[17:08:28] <catbadger> I HATE EDGE
[17:08:37] <catbadger> I should have been a carpenter.
[17:11:40] <hellyeah-tired> i couldnt avoid null
[17:14:46] <catbadger> I'm nearly 37 and considering putting down 20 years of coding to go be an apprentice framer... which pays the same...
[17:18:56] <taplar> hellyeah-tired: what?
[17:20:53] <catbadger> Actually better... IT employees get no overtime in my area.
[17:21:25] <taplar> we're all salary.  there is no over time, :)
[17:21:55] <catbadger> I'm not salray
[17:21:59] <catbadger> I'm hourly
[17:22:05] <catbadger> I'm also not paid overtime.
[17:22:10] <catbadger> that's the law here.
[17:22:19] <catbadger> well they're not required to pay overtime
[17:22:28] <catbadger> I get 1.2x overtime hours
[17:23:34] <catbadger> growl b*tch moan.
[17:23:38] <catbadger> lol
[17:23:47] <catbadger> no pension
[17:24:30] <catbadger> anywho i'm going back to trying to make IE do things correctly...
[17:40:23] <devi8> This is too hard to describe without a visual, but could somebody please look at this: https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/opVmWd
[17:40:54] <devi8> I explained the situation in it. It's still a rough draft.
[18:44:18] <mrush> using the assignment operator to update a value in a json object fails. what method should i use to update an existing object, or are they not mutable?
[18:44:37] <taplar> you should be able to use assignment
[18:44:44] <taplar> theObject[aKey] = aValue
[18:44:59] <SoldierOfFORTRAN> ^
[18:45:01] <taplar> or theObject.aLiteralKey = aValue
[18:45:27] <SoldierOfFORTRAN> mrush what are you doing now?
[18:46:03] <lissitzki> anybody here?
[18:46:22] <SoldierOfFORTRAN> lilalinux about 375 people.
[18:46:25] <SoldierOfFORTRAN> errr.
[18:46:27] <SoldierOfFORTRAN> lissitzki
[18:46:30] <taplar> few peeps, and an invader of FORTRAN
[18:46:31] <lissitzki> eheh
[18:46:33] <SoldierOfFORTRAN> tabcomplete fail.
[18:46:51] <taplar> lmao

[18:50:23] <taplar> of course
[18:50:26] <AbrahamLinkedIn> nice shurt
[18:51:07] * taplar is currently in deep thought trying to figure out a nick to one up the prez
[18:51:36] <AbrahamLinkedIn> there are tons.
[18:51:58] <AbrahamLinkedIn> Thrill Gates, Wu Tang LAN, George RoR Martin
[18:52:00] <AbrahamLinkedIn> etc etc
[18:52:06] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/65cc2aps/11/
[18:52:07] <taplar> I'm failing.  All i got so far are some puns on "A penny for your thoughts" and some how working in the phrase "my heart's a twitter"
[18:52:37] <lissitzki> so this is my fiddle, it is working, except for te fact that when i use it on my site it doesn't
[18:52:47] <AbrahamLinkedIn> lissitzki is it unemployedc?
[18:52:51] <AbrahamLinkedIn> orrr...? ;)
[18:53:12] <lissitzki> i discovered also that if I use an href="#", it works on my site as well
[18:53:19] <taplar> this looks like an older fiddle.  cause you still have the double document ready in there
[18:53:35] <lissitzki> ah yes
[18:53:37] <AbrahamLinkedIn> lissitzki define "doesn't work"?
[18:53:39] <AbrahamLinkedIn> what doesn't it do?
[18:54:06] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/65cc2aps/12/
[18:54:17] <lissitzki> it doesn't change the class to the active link
[18:54:28] <AbrahamLinkedIn> any console errors or anything?
[18:54:29] <lissitzki> but if the href is on # it works
[18:55:18] <lissitzki> the $('selector').length is doubled, but that do not seems a problem
[18:55:32] <lissitzki> at least not for other jquery
[18:55:38] <AbrahamLinkedIn> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/65cc2aps/13/
[18:55:42] <AbrahamLinkedIn> what happens with this?
[18:55:45] <AbrahamLinkedIn> on your site?
[18:57:39] <Gonnareada> when all else fails, make an std joke.  night all
[18:57:47] <AbrahamLinkedIn> kbyeeeeeeeeeeee
[18:58:40] <lissitzki> AbrahamLinkedIn, there is no href so i cannot click it
[18:58:47] <AbrahamLinkedIn> ....
[18:58:51] <AbrahamLinkedIn> erm.
[18:58:57] <AbrahamLinkedIn> you can.
[19:00:13] <AbrahamLinkedIn> lissitzki https://i.imgur.com/OwgU07o.png
[19:02:09] <lissitzki> true
[19:02:11] <lissitzki> wait
[19:02:44] <lissitzki> not working
[19:02:48] <lissitzki> on the site
[19:03:06] <AbrahamLinkedIn> lissitzki how are these nav items created?
[19:03:08] <AbrahamLinkedIn> like, via JS
[19:03:08] <AbrahamLinkedIn> ?
[19:04:53] <lissitzki> no
[19:04:55] <lissitzki> twig
[19:04:59] <lissitzki> for loop
[19:05:06] <AbrahamLinkedIn> what is twig?
[19:05:12] <lissitzki> php
[19:05:24] <AbrahamLinkedIn> okay.  and your js is linked in your footer?
[19:05:29] <AbrahamLinkedIn> or within a doc ready?
[19:05:31] <AbrahamLinkedIn> and your page is valid?
[19:05:58] <lissitzki> moment, i didn't use your code properly
[19:09:07] <lissitzki> js is in a external file, loaded in head
[19:09:22] <AbrahamLinkedIn> and is your markup valid?
[19:09:25] <lissitzki> how do i know if my page is valid?
[19:10:05] <AbrahamLinkedIn> a dirty hack way is to replace $(document).ready(function() { with $(window).load(function() {
[19:12:00] <AbrahamLinkedIn> if suddenly stuff works, you've got something else going on.
[19:12:45] <lissitzki> nope
[19:12:50] <lissitzki> it doesn't
[19:13:21] <AbrahamLinkedIn> but https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/65cc2aps/14/
[19:13:26] <AbrahamLinkedIn> this gives you a number?
[19:13:40] <AbrahamLinkedIn> then you've got something else preventing the handler from hiring.
[19:13:41] <AbrahamLinkedIn> *firing.
[19:13:56] <AbrahamLinkedIn> you don't have any pointer-events: disabled; or anything going on in your css, do you?
[19:15:41] <lissitzki> let me see
[19:15:50] <AbrahamLinkedIn> you said it works once you add href="#"?
[19:15:57] <lissitzki> yes
[19:16:15] <AbrahamLinkedIn> yeah, sounds like some CSS or other js is targeting anchors withot hrefs trhen.
[19:45:56] <lissitzki> i was wron
[19:45:58] <lissitzki> g
[19:46:00] <AbrahamLinkedIn> ?
[19:46:22] <lissitzki> about working with href=#
[19:46:29] <robertmaxrees> can you be more specific?
[19:47:06] <lissitzki> it was a:focus having the same color of the class i'm trying to give with the script
[19:47:21] <robertmaxrees> so has it been working this entire time?
[19:47:24] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[19:47:25] <lissitzki> so on href it was just a:focus on on the link
[19:47:26] <robertmaxrees> i get it.
[19:47:37] <robertmaxrees> so href isn't working either?
[19:47:43] <robertmaxrees> did you try the window.load trick?
[19:49:41] <lissitzki> yeah, not working
[19:49:48] <lissitzki> giving up for the day
[19:50:05] <lissitzki> can't spend hrs on this
[19:50:15] <lissitzki> i'll try other solution
[19:50:22] <lissitzki> thanks btw
[19:50:34] <robertmaxrees> sure
[21:58:49] <WillPittenger> Is there a good way to force an image to reload from a GreaseMonkey script?  I'm seeing some images fail to load until the user clicks them.  I've tried simulating a click, but that isn't working.
