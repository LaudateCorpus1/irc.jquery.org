[00:03:33] <Cork> rubeez: ya, i tried adding a clearing loop, but sadly it failed quite bad

[00:48:23] <Christer> Anyone got any tips on how to create a dynamic image map? (add / remove content e.e)
[01:01:25] <lemonsparrow> I have code similar to this code snippet http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/pv6d7/1/ where I have four tabs and I am hiding 3 of these tabs during document ready and when users selects any of the tabs the other tab is hidden..
[01:01:58] <lemonsparrow> this seems to work but when I navigate to some other page and come back to this page.. all the contents of 4 tabs gets listed one below the other...
[01:02:13] <lemonsparrow> any help would be appreciated
[01:16:28] <j3lte> this code does not work at all in JSFiddle, so it seems
[01:27:59] <Kingsy> guys, I am changing the src on an image with jquery on hover, however there seems to be a delay before it changes, how do I stop this?
[01:28:29] <systemfault> Nobody has been doing that since year 2000 :P
[01:28:48] <Cork> Kingsy: you would have to precache the image
[01:28:51] <systemfault> I mean, can't you use CSS sprites?
[01:29:22] <Cork> Kingsy: but ya, use a background image instead and change it with bg position
[01:30:16] <Kingsy> Cork: hmm thats why? there is a delay when I use a src of ""
[01:30:28] <Kingsy> Cork: surely it wouldnt delay changing to a deadlink?
[01:30:44] <Cork> Kingsy: it would load the current url i think
[01:31:00] <Cork> Kingsy: and why don't you just hide the image instead of setting it to "" ?
[01:31:26] <Kingsy> Cork: it was just a test
[01:31:49] <Kingsy> Cork: I will use a real image when I get the functionality working, I am not actually setting to "" its "isdofjsdifsjdoidj" :P
[01:32:12] <Kingsy> and it still delays.. which is weird.
[01:32:14] <Cork> Kingsy: and that will hit the network, and there is your delay
[01:32:41] <Kingsy> Cork: ah ok, so use an image but preload it
[01:32:49] <Kingsy> thanks Cork
[01:33:04] <Cork> and make sure the image exists when you set it yes
[01:33:11] <Kingsy> :)
[01:33:23] <Cork> if the image doens't exist, it will hit the network every time
[01:34:27] <Kingsy> not a problem
[01:34:46] <Kingsy> Cork: how long you been working with js/jquery?
[01:35:06] <Cork> Kingsy: since the mid 90's :)
[01:35:47] <Kingsy> Cork: you just always seem to have the answer :P
[01:36:08] <Cork> well not always, and sometimes i'm dead wrong

[02:24:24] <chipnt-> hi everyone
[02:30:29] <chipnt-> insertAfter on versions onlder than 1.9 .. is there any trick I could use to reproduce same effect?
[02:31:56] <ServerSage> Is it possible to strip any possible HTML from a password input field?
[02:32:13] <Cork> chipnt-: what are you talking about?
[02:32:21] <Cork> chipnt-: insertAfter has been around for ages
[02:32:31] <chipnt-> http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[02:32:39] <chipnt-> not on 1.8.2 ?
[02:32:48] <Cork> "version added: 1.0"
[02:33:24] <chipnt-> K brb then I might have a issue somewhere else then thx
[02:33:48] <Cork> ServerSage: not easily no
[02:34:08] <Cork> ServerSage: a possible way MIGHT be $('<div').html($('input').val()).text()
[02:34:14] <Cork> opps
[02:34:25] <Cork> $('<div>').html($('input').val()).text()
[02:34:27] <ServerSage> Cork: Yeah, that's the only way I've found to do it.  Was hoping there was a less cludgy way.
[02:34:44] <Cork> ServerSage: only other option would be regex
[02:34:54] <ServerSage> Cork: Alrighty, thanks.
[02:57:46] <chipnt-> http://jsfiddle.net/x4Dms/ if I change to 1.8.3 Box1 dissapears when click to get back closed. Any hints?

[03:00:35] <Cork> i see no difference what so ever no matter what version of jquery i pick there
[03:01:46] <chipnt-> Cork, chrome. When u click AGAin on BOX1 to close it on jquery 1.8.3 it dissapears
[03:04:42] <Cork> chipnt-: your trying to insert the element infront of it self
[03:06:09] <chipnt-> Cork, should I add a condition, if it's the first element?
[03:06:11] <Cork> chipnt-: i would recommend using prepend instead
[03:06:14] <chipnt-> thx
[03:06:29] <Cork> $(parent).prepend(thisbox)
[03:06:53] <Cork> or thisbox.parent().prepend(thisbox)

[03:22:35] <Cork> CodeDEV: make sure you have jquery loaded
[03:22:42] <CodeDEV> But I see the jquery-1.9.1.js in the head.
[03:22:58] <Cork> CodeDEV: also that is a ready listener not a click handler
[03:23:19] <CodeDEV> its just output message so its should work, right?
[03:23:29] <Cork> CodeDEV: you've the second person in a few days i've seen done that; where form did you get that ready was a click handler?
[03:23:38] <Cork> CodeDEV: yes
[03:23:46] <Cork> as long as jquery is loaded
[03:24:05] <Cork> (and no other errors occurs in the page)
[03:24:18] <CodeDEV> what about the location of the script. Top or bottom? Its a WordPRess site btw
[03:24:45] <Cork> CodeDEV: jquery should be in the head, and the script should be below that
[03:24:58] <Cork> if you put the script in the head or at the bottom of the body, is up to you

[03:31:12] <CodeDEV> the php code is already written. This is a jquery question. If I click a button, I need a jquery action to use an alternative line of PHP code.
[03:50:09] <vsync_> CodeDEV: hmm. well the obvious choice would be to pass a param with POST I guess
[03:51:40] <cusco> Hello folks
[03:51:42] <CodeDEV> oh yeah, I remember that. BUt how did I write a post inside a jquery
[03:52:32] <vsync_> you're doing an ajax call, right?
[03:52:36] <cusco> using jquery ui menu ...I add items with .append(<li>blabla</li>) and then .menu('refresh')
[03:52:48] <cusco> can I somehow add a menu item, and make a effect on it
[03:52:50] <cusco> like hilight
[03:52:54] <cusco> ?
[03:53:41] <vsync_> cusco: I see no reason why you couldn't
[03:54:18] <moritz> hi all. I have an application which uses a datepicker on a hidden element, and that worked with jquery 1.6.4, but doesn't work with 1.10.1 anymore
[03:54:22] <vsync_> CodeDEV: ?
[03:54:54] <CodeDEV> I'll do anything to make it work
[03:54:58] <vsync_> well
[03:55:00] <CodeDEV> Don't know how though.
[03:55:03] <cusco> vsync_: when .menu('refresh') is called the jquery ui redraws the menu, how do I identify the newly added item and make a effect on it ?
[03:55:05] <CodeDEV> havent seen any examples
[03:55:09] <moritz> there is a link that should activate the datepicker, and it does $InputElem.trigger('focus')
[03:55:24] <moritz> and with newer jquery, nothing happens
[03:55:26] <cusco> or on the .append(li) I could bind a effect .. ?
[03:55:28] <vsync_> CodeDEV: well are you trying to accomplish this without a page refresh or?
[03:55:37] <moritz> but it works if I unhide the element
[03:55:53] <moritz> any idea how I can get it to work with a hidden element?
[03:56:09] <CodeDEV> I need it to happen with a page refresh. You know like in youtube, when you click latest videos, thats ajax right?
[03:56:16] <CodeDEV> *without
[03:56:18] <CodeDEV> *without
[03:56:39] <moritz> (if the question isn't clear, please ask for clarification)
[03:57:55] <vsync_> cusco: well, you could always do var foo = $("<li>", {id: "bar", class: "baz"}); I think
[03:58:44] <vsync_> CodeDEV: yeah, well then you'll do ajax. Don't know how hairy it gets when you have to populate something large
[04:00:27] <cusco> vsync_: I'm already doing: li = $('<li class="usr" data-grp="' + client.roomId + '"><a href="#">' + client.Username + '</a></li>').on('click', function (e) { stuff });
[04:00:54] <vsync_> you pass a param with, say POST to the php script, which you want to then return perhaps a JSON, CodeDEV
[04:01:09] <cusco> then .append(li) .... thing is.. on the .menu('fefresh') ... I would like only this <li> to hilight
[04:01:26] <cusco> how?
[04:01:40] <vsync_> So by default that jquery thing highlights all or?
[04:01:57] <vsync_> the menu ui or whatever you were using?
[04:02:24] <cusco> vsync_: I would like the hilight to be aplied only once the the newly added menu item (li)
[04:02:45] <vsync_> yeah i got that part
[04:02:51] <vsync_> but what exactly is the problem
[04:02:56] <mathi> hi
[04:02:59] <mathi> is that correct ?
[04:03:00] <mathi> $('input[type=radio][name=type]').(':checked')
[04:03:16] <vsync_> CodeDEV: and after that, you populate the post container with the contents of the json returned by the php
[04:03:28] <vsync_> chances are you have to highly modify your php
[04:03:51] <vsync_> and of course, before that, you clear the post container
[04:04:32] <cusco> sorry vsync_ I didn't know I could add .effec() to the var li, and it would still be processed... never mind it just works. Sorry
[04:04:39] <cusco> and thank you
[04:04:44] <vsync_> nps
[04:06:02] <vsync_> CodeDEV: at least that would be my initial approach
[04:07:25] <Kingsy> is there a way of telling from an Image() object if the image exists or not?
[04:07:26] <vsync_> in php, just populate an array with the latest posts, and sort them in the order you want, after that encode it to json and spit it out
[04:07:48] <CodeDEV> that sounds all great. but I would appreacite if there was some kinda of code I could actually see. ANy examples like this?
[04:08:58] <Kingsy> oh I see, onerror() and onload()
[04:09:35] <CodeDEV> vysnc_ are there any example code online???
[04:13:02] <CodeDEV> vsync_ you have given me a lot good advice. How can I implement it?
[04:13:14] <rabbi1> how can i get the values of object falling with in date range ?
[04:14:22] <vsync_> CodeDEV: you're basically asking me to do your work
[04:16:20] <CodeDEV> No. I just haven't used all that stuff you mentioned. With the JSON, the ajax and the post. I'm googling right now, just wondering if you had any good sources of information.
[04:19:28] <vsync_> broadly what you do is, you have a, say php file or a function in a file, you call with ajax
[04:20:57] <vsync_> now the php part, fetches the posts you want, puts them in an array, say: $arr = (0 => array('title' => 'foo', 'body' => 'bar', 'author' => 'baz'));
[04:21:20] <vsync_> then you encode & echo it, so it gets passed to the jquery: echo json_encode($arr);
[04:21:51] <vsync_> and after that, in your jquery, on ajax_success, you just clear your post container, and re-populate it iterating through the json you just created
[04:22:23] <vsync_> now that's as detailed i'm going to go
[04:22:31] <vsync_> the rest, you can find with google
[04:23:02] <vsync_> the array definition is f'd up, btw
[04:23:09] <vsync_> but you get what I mean, probably
[04:23:32] <vsync_> it's supposed to be, $arr = array(...)
[04:24:38] <drager> What's the jquery mobile channel?
[04:25:38] <vsync_> CodeDEV: chances are, you're not going to find a solution that fits exactly your needs, but you have to combine things from here and there
[04:26:28] <vsync_> oh, and FYI, the "post" part, you can just access the params passed to php in $_POST
[04:26:53] <vsync_> doesnt have to be post, per se. Now i'm off, take care
[04:28:01] <CodeDEV> thank you
[04:30:48] <drager> Is this the channel to ask questions about jquery mobile? Or is there any other specific for mobile?
[04:40:50] <rabbi1> hi, how can get data falling within specified date range http://jsfiddle.net/ckLRH/ ?
[04:42:29] <spobat> hi
[04:42:38] <rabbi1> sorry, here is the updated one http://jsfiddle.net/ckLRH/1/
[04:42:55] <spobat> in jquery ui, is it possible to get the real position (e.g. moved from 4th to 2nd) instead of absolute coordinate positions?
[04:42:55] <spobat> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-update
[04:44:00] <spobat> the problem is that not all elements are equally big

[04:50:34] <Erma_> Hi all, I am using stellar.js for my site and my problem is jquery waypoint is not working with stellar. How can i solve this? Please help, Thanks
[04:56:02] <chipnt-> Cork: that failed.. thx anyways I'll keep trying things
[04:56:50] <Erma_> Hi all, I am using stellar.js for my site and my problem is jquery waypoint is not working with stellar. How can i solve this? Please help, Thanks
[04:58:27] <CodeDEV> how can I post data from a jquery
[04:58:32] <Erma_> Anybody please help
[05:00:41] <CodeDEV> How do I put a click even on this like in jquery? http://pastebin.com/7fKdy6Pz
[05:00:46] <CodeDEV> ##javascript
[05:02:33] <vsync_> CodeDEV: first of all you wrap the .ajax inside the event bind
[05:02:41] <drager> Is this the channel to ask questions about jquery mobile? Or is there any other specific for mobile?
[05:02:56] <vsync_> CodeDEV: and the <?php part is useless
[05:05:52] <CodeDEV> How do I change the ajax to work like an event click like the one above it(the jquery)?
[05:06:08] <vsync_> look
[05:06:42] <vsync_> mmehh
[05:06:47] <vsync_> the function block for the event is fired when it triggers
[05:06:47] <vsync_> so wrap the $.ajax inside it
[05:06:51] <vsync_> gettit?
[05:07:35] <vsync_> like: $('.profile_filters li #popular').click(function(){
[05:07:38] <vsync_> fycj
[05:08:33] <vsync_> like: $('.profile_filters li #popular').click(function(){ $.ajax({ ... }); });
[05:09:45] <CodeDEV> you mean like this? How do I retrieve the post from ajax data?
[05:10:09] <Cork> CodeDEV: have you tried reading the documentation?
[05:10:11] <Cork> ?.ajax
[05:10:11] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:10:19] <Cork> or see ?.post
[05:10:19] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[05:10:32] <vsync_> i mean like how i just put it
[05:11:15] <Cork> vsync_: you don't have the success section in there
[05:11:24] <vsync_> CodeDEV: you retrieve the data sent by whatever, inside the ajax call with success: function(data) {}
[05:11:25] <Cork> but honestly he should just read the documentation
[05:11:42] <vsync_> which is fired when the call is completed successfully
[05:11:49] <vsync_> and stores the output in data, in that case
[05:12:07] <vsync_> Cork: now i do ;p
[05:12:16] <pSouper> hi all, i have a question… I run a  doc ready script that tries to "do stuff" with elements that may or may not be on the page. would i need to check if the element exists for every thing i wish to "do stuff" with? because if seems like a lot of wrapping in $('.mything').length >0){ do stuff} - is there a shorter/better way of doing it without throwing errors for missing elements
[05:12:29] <vsync_> but he needs to define a lot of other things, than success also :p so i couldn't be bothered
[05:12:36] <Cork> pSouper: no
[05:12:48] <vsync_> I hope this is not one of those cases where he's doing this for a client and he has no clue
[05:12:55] <pSouper> hehe - short an sweat and appreciated - thanks Cork
[05:12:55] <Cork> pSouper: as long as you don't work on the return values from jquery you are safe
[05:13:27] <pSouper> safe to not check and just have the mini-error?
[05:13:39] <Cork> pSouper: ex. $('something').data('some').class.object will crash if something doesn't exist
[05:13:53] <pSouper> yup
[05:14:19] <Cork> pSouper: but ex. $('something').hide().css('some', 'other').animate()...; will just not execute
[05:14:25] <pSouper> and $('.stuff).removeClass('foo'); shouldn't break right
[05:14:27] <Cork> so no error and no failing code
[05:14:51] <Cork> basically ya, except  isn't allowed in class names
[05:15:17] <pSouper> okay - thanks. my console likes to throw errors as warnings that just bugged me
[05:15:41] <CodeDEV> I'm a little confused. DO I put my code inside the function or data?
[05:15:46] <CodeDEV> http://pastebin.com/XKftV6qb
[05:15:49] <pSouper> i'd be happy to leave them in but didn't want to be missing something that later on came back to haunt me
[05:15:53] <pSouper> thanks Cork
[05:16:48] <vsync_> CodeDEV: jeez...
[05:17:05] <vsync_> the success block is the output from your script
[05:17:23] <vsync_> I think I have to call quits on this
[05:17:55] <vsync_> or, well, it's not "output" per se, but it's the thing that's executed when the ajax call is completed successfully
[05:18:01] <CodeDEV> I only need to pass a value to change the query_post of my wordpress function
[05:18:44] <CodeDEV> so if I click "latest" I can have "show_posts=5&order_by=ASC" kinda thing
[05:18:49] <vsync_> that'll make things very hairy
[05:19:04] <vsync_> I suggest just do it with a page refresh
[05:19:13] <vsync_> e.g. a static link
[05:20:05] <vsync_> you will need to do a buttload of parsing on the returned json
[05:20:30] <vsync_> and, no offense, but i think you won't be able to do it
[05:20:39] <CodeDEV> :-(
[05:20:47] <vsync_> and i'm done with this, sorry
[05:21:04] <CodeDEV> so I haven't even come close?
[05:21:05] <Cork> vsync_: he could just return a new set of html and add/replace it on the page
[05:21:21] <Cork> but ya, i think he would have to learn the basics first
[05:21:38] <vsync_> Cork: he could. But we're talking wordpress here.
[05:21:51] <Cork> vsync_: still possible
[05:21:58] <vsync_> yes, possible, also complicated
[05:22:08] <lemonsparrow> Hi I have 4 tabs in my page out of which I am hiding 3 tabs on page load and displaying the first.. when user clicks on any other tabs the other tabs gets hidden.. similar to this code snippet http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/a3uvy/ but if I navigate to some other page and visit this page back.. the contents of all the 4 tabs gets displayed together under single tab
[05:22:09] <Cork> depends on how you chose to implement it
[05:22:32] <lemonsparrow> this was a dirty fix I applied to get over the issue <body onload="setTimeout(function(){showTab(1)},3000)">
[05:22:36] <Cork> lemonsparrow: your fiddle doens't work...
[05:22:52] <Cork> its just a plain ul with 4 li's
[05:23:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I dont know why it isnt working
[05:23:03] <vsync_> you can make a plugin for wordpress, which handles the fetching of the needed posts, and call that via ajax. Then just figure the best practice to replace the post container
[05:23:13] <CodeDEV> What do I need to put in the ajax url, if it is on the same page/file?
[05:23:14] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but the js would give u the logic I have applied..
[05:23:16] <Cork> lemonsparrow: cause you have no css for it?
[05:23:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: <body onload="setTimeout(function(){showTab(1)},3000)"> this solves the issue but takes 3  seconds for the page to remove the issue
[05:24:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: its a dirty fix
[05:24:13] <lemonsparrow> Cork: is there  a better solution.. could be a flaw in my js logic eithere
[05:24:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork: pls help
[05:24:28] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well hard to tell what should happen, or not...
[05:25:22] <Cork> lemonsparrow: btw why don't you just set a class on the ul, and have that do the padding-top thing?
[05:25:28] <Cork> much cleaner code
[05:25:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork: could u show that on my code ?
[05:29:46] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/a3uvy/2/
[05:30:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: this is how it looks in a neater way http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/a3uvy/3/
[05:31:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: have u edited only the js ?
[05:31:00] <Cork> lemonsparrow: what look?
[05:31:08] <Cork> i added one class to the html
[05:31:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the html
[05:31:23] <Cork> the html means nothing to me, as i can't see the result
[05:31:40] <lemonsparrow> u added class current-tab and u made changes to js too right
[05:31:40] <lemonsparrow> ?
[05:31:47] <Cork> yes
[05:32:04] <Cork> i removed like 80% of the switch case
[05:32:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yep
[05:35:54] <lemonsparrow> Cork: didnt work at all got blank screen
[05:41:46] <Lindrian> How can I select the nth element under a certain div?
[05:42:02] <Cork> Lindrian: .children().eq(index)
[05:42:18] <lemonsparrow> Lindrian: http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[05:42:21] <Cork> or if you mean in a selector :nth-child()
[05:42:46] <Lindrian> well i wanna add a class to an element on hover in and remove it on hover out
[05:43:00] <Lindrian> its like <div><b>blah</b><b>foo</b></div>
[05:43:03] <Cork> though be warned nth-child is a bit tricky in how it works in combinations with other selectors
[05:43:15] <Lindrian> i wanna select the nth <b> inside that div
[05:43:22] <Lindrian> depending on stuff
[05:43:33] <Cork> Lindrian: i would recommend setting a class on the div, and let static css do the styling of the child
[05:43:50] <Lindrian> i have a class on the div, and its not an option
[05:43:54] <Cork> you might even not need js at all
[05:43:57] <Lindrian> it needs to be done with css as
[05:44:35] <Cork> .class-div.hover b:last-child {}
[05:44:51] <Lindrian> brother, it does not work with css.
[05:45:04] <Cork> or completely without js: .class-div:hover b:last-child {}
[05:45:15] <Cork> Lindrian: why wouldn't it?
[05:45:26] <Lindrian> because for what im doing it would not work
[05:47:12] <Lindrian> i got it to work anyway, thanks for the help
[05:47:18] <Lindrian> $(".treeview_pattern").children("b.err").eq($(this).index() - 1).addClass("selected_paren");
[05:47:19] <Lindrian> is the code
[05:47:20] <chrisbuchholz> hi guys
[05:48:18] <chrisbuchholz> Im trying to capture cmd+s, but it always opens the save dialog. I also catch ctrl+s which works fine. I am doing event.preventDefault(), so why does the save dialog still appear?
[05:49:20] <Cork> chrisbuchholz: i don't think you can prevent the save dialog actually
[05:49:28] <bluesm> How can I create my own collection
[05:49:35] <chrisbuchholz> Cork: all right
[05:49:40] <Cork> bluesm: collection of what?
[05:49:52] <bluesm> without creating elements, adding to them class and them gather them by class.
[05:50:00] <bluesm> Cork: Collection of Audio elements.
[05:50:14] <Cork> bluesm: not sure what you mean by that
[05:50:28] <bluesm> Cork: I will create audio elements.
[05:50:48] <bluesm> Cork: And I need to manage them, play appropriate in appriopriate time (regarding to user events)
[05:51:04] <Cork> bluesm: save them in an array, or an object
[05:51:06] <bluesm> Cork: And I want them in the collection, I could make array of Jquery Object
[05:51:59] <mrHAT> is this doable : http://pastebin.com/XPi8gZ77
[05:52:04] <bluesm> Cork: But This will create serveral collection of length = 1...
[05:52:04] <mrHAT> i'm missing something
[05:52:14] <SargoDarya_> hey guys, short question. I have a problem and don't know if there is a solution. We try to wrap a DOM element containing an iframe. The problem here is: When wrapping the iframe it calls the iframes site twice
[05:52:35] <X_Panni_X> Hey everyone :) I've got a lil question: I've got a div container which is hidden, then the div container is filled with text/html and using jquery's  .slideDown it becomes visible. Now it is possible that the text in the div container is longer/shorter then before how could I make the div container getting the right size using the slide effect?
[05:52:49] <Cork> bluesm: well, objects and arrays is the cheapest ways you can store multiple dom references
[05:52:55] <seutje> mrHAT: where are you trying to get at?
[05:53:31] <mrHAT> handleCatalogSettingsRequest.resultCallback(json); this line should execute     alert(json.name);
[05:53:39] <Cork> mrHAT: yes, that is doable
[05:53:44] <mrHAT> it's a wrapper for my ajax requests
[05:53:46] <bluesm> Cork: So don't use the jquery,
[05:53:47] <mrHAT> that im doing
[05:53:52] <Cork> you can pass a function as a value from one varaible to another
[05:54:09] <mrHAT> Cork but what am i missing there
[05:54:10] <Cork> bluesm: you can use an jquery object to hold the dom references if you like
[05:54:11] <bluesm> Cork: In this moment, just   document.createElement("audio") and push it to the array ?
[05:54:15] <seutje> mrHAT: sure, but this is a but silly, and u should prolly set that function to a noop instead of null
[05:54:22] <seutje> so u can call it without getting errors left and right
[05:54:28] <bluesm> Cork: But the question if I need jQuery object.
[05:54:39] <mrHAT> seutje why would i get errors :)
[05:54:49] <bluesm> Cork: Probably not, jquery doesn't offerr any good methods for audio. Is it ?
[05:54:52] <Cork> bluesm: only if you want to run jquery functions on it
[05:54:54] <mrHAT> i'm not doing random calls to that
[05:55:05] <Cork> bluesm: jquery is for dom manipulation, not much else
[05:55:20] <seutje> cause u might end up trying to call null
[05:55:21] <seutje> mrHAT: then why define it at all?
[05:55:21] <Cork> mrHAT: what is the error?
[05:55:29] <mrHAT> well .. json not defined ?
[05:55:33] <seutje> null or undefined don't matter in this case
[05:55:33] <seutje> just a couple extra bytes making it null
[05:55:44] <spobat> how can I check the how maniest child it is?
[05:55:49] <seutje> oh
[05:55:52] <mrHAT> handleCategoryData() does not receive the json object
[05:56:19] <Cork> mrHAT: look at the rest of the code http://jsfiddle.net/CB2zV/
[05:56:21] <Cork> works fine here
[05:56:24] <spobat> How can I get the order id of a child?
[05:56:32] <Cork> ?.index
[05:56:33] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[05:56:34] <spobat> I wanna know if a child is the 3rd one, the 4th one etc
[05:56:42] <Cork> spobat: ^
[05:56:53] <spobat> I have the parent and the child object
[05:57:03] <spobat> (nothing else :p)
[05:57:03] <seutje> mrHAT: this test case isn't accurate, u got some anonymous functions creating their own scope or something? -> http://jsfiddle.net/GHaTG/
[05:57:09] <mrHAT> ahh damn it
[05:57:11] <seutje> damnit cork
[05:57:17] <seutje> too fast -_-
[05:57:23] <Cork> ^^'
[05:57:25] <drager> Is this the channel to ask questions about jquery mobile? Or is there any other specific for mobile?
[05:57:28] * seutje walks away
[05:58:21] <Cork> drager: yes it is
[05:58:51] <drager> alright
[05:58:52] <drager> thanks
[06:00:31] <spobat> Cork: thank you :)
[06:00:55] <mrHAT> sorry Cork .. i was forgeting to unset that function.. it was getting executed again somewhere in my code.. hehe
[06:01:28] <SargoDarya_> Me, stupid wrap functionality
[06:01:29] <SargoDarya_> http://jsfiddle.net/b8TPW/1/
[06:01:59] <SargoDarya_> Wrapping an iframe triggers a reload of the iframe inside, sending 2 requests instead of only one
[06:04:07] <Cork> classic :D
[06:17:16] <mrHAT> Cork : anything wrong with this approach http://pastebin.com/PJ0tPirL ?
[06:17:59] <Cork> mrHAT: stuff.initStuff()
[06:18:13] <mrHAT> yes sorry
[06:18:20] <Cork> or simply $(document).ready(stuff.initStuff);
[06:18:43] <mrHAT> i got various methods that need to be called ..
[06:18:48] <sanova> hi
[06:19:01] <X_Panni_X> Could someone tell me how I can fix that error? http://pastebin.com/U9qA5c0Q I think it's caused by the <

[06:19:50] <Cork> escape the angle bracket

[06:21:25] <mrHAT> Cork what happens when "someselector1" is not located anywhere in the dom .. will the click trigger be ignored ?
[06:21:36] <mrHAT> should i do additional checks or jquery allready does that
[06:21:37] <Cork> mrHAT: yes
[06:22:05] <Cork> it will be the same as doing $([]).click() so click will loop over an empty array and do nothing
[06:22:24] <mrHAT> should i just load js corresponding to a section in my site ?
[06:22:37] <Cork> what?
[06:22:41] <mrHAT> hmm
[06:22:45] <mrHAT> let me better illustrate
[06:23:12] <mrHAT> i load tons of js  everywhere where i dont need ..
[06:23:32] <cusco> hey.. i'm looking at http://api.jquery.com/animate/ about the step option ... using backgroundColor in each step the rgb values are always the original.. are not incrementing ...
[06:23:46] <mrHAT> damn .. you don't happen to speak russian don't you
[06:23:47] <mrHAT> :)
[06:24:03] <Cork> no
[06:24:16] <jop008> Does someone made a connection with picasa for photos on a jqmobile site?
[06:24:32] <Cork> cusco: the basica animate does't support color animation
[06:24:48] <Cork> cusco: you need a plugin for that; ex. i think jquery ui has it
[06:25:11] <Cork> *basic
[06:25:30] <cusco> Cork: I am using jquery color from the link provided in http://jqueryui.com/animate/
[06:25:37] <cusco> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/
[06:26:23] <cusco> Cork: the color changes gradually, I would like to read the rgb values changing on the step: function(now,fx){...}
[06:26:56] <Cork> cusco: i think you would have to parse the color element again
[06:27:04] <cusco> hmm
[06:27:06] <cusco> ok
[06:27:17] <Cork> i don't think the plugin exposes its parsed values
[06:27:22] <cusco> I see
[06:27:24] <sanova> i have some issues refreshing tooltip text on element title update: from here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6650853/jquery-tools-tooltip-change-title nothing works for me but only following solution: $(document).tooltip("destroy"); changeTitleElement..; $(document).tooltip(myTooltipOptions); Is the only way to refresh specific tooltip if i initialize tooltips with $(document).tooltip(myTooltipOptions) ?
[06:27:26] <sanova>  
[06:28:03] <cusco> Cork: I am already using jquery ui, does that mean I don't need to use this jquery.color plugin ??
[06:28:43] <Cork> cusco: yes, it is already built into ui
[06:30:13] <jop008> Can this also be used for jqMobile http://code.google.com/p/pwi/?
[06:37:46] <Ansikt> I'd like to be able to fill two different containers with different parts of data I'm getting via ajax.  For example, if I have <div class="foo" /> and <div class="bar" />, and my ajax call returns contents containing <div class="zig" /> and <div class="zag" />
[06:37:56] <CodeDEV> Can someone please help? http://pastebin.com/B4J8NYZ6
[06:38:03] <Ansikt> how do I place zig within foo, and zag within bar?
[06:38:43] <Ansikt> Right now, my plan is to fill a hidden div with both zig and zag, then move the contents to foo and bar, then delete the hidden div, but this seems like a bad approach.  Does anyone have any suggestions?
[06:38:51] <Cork> Ansikt: simplest is prob to send the two different html sections in a json response and then just append/replace the content in the two targets
[06:40:35] <Ansikt> Cork: That seems to be the answer I've seen elsewhere on the internet, but our web framework (ATG/JSP) doesn't have any built in JSON support, so I'd like to do without using json if possible
[06:41:44] <Ansikt> Would it be possible for me to parse the data in memory without actually writing it to the page?
[06:42:05] <Cork> Ansikt: that makes it a little more complicated, but you could do something like var frag = $(data); $('#foo').html(frag.filter('#zig'));$('#bar').html(frag.filter('#zag'))
[06:42:09] <lemonsparrow> Cork: is there a way to reset body onload() method... here I am facing issue with onload problem while navigating to another page and coming back

[06:44:31] <CodeDEV> How can I get information from a WP db and load them onto the page with jquery. Anything like this  http://pastebin.com/B4J8NYZ6
[06:46:03] <myosotis> CodeDEV, what info? you can perhaps use the built in rss feed stuff in wp to get the data you want
[06:47:36] <CodeDEV> I want to display my WP posts(videos) depending on a click on the webpage (latest, popular) and filter the page accordingly.
[06:48:54] <joniop> hey ! Can someone explain me why does my charts won't show up by default (i have to select one to display it) ? http://jsfiddle.net/P2Nyf/
[06:53:53] <myosotis> then I definitely think you can get the data you want via an rss feed
[06:58:55] <CodeDEV> How can I use jquery ajax to execute a diffrent php line of code and show that within the page? Filtering basically.
[07:00:48] <joniop> hey ! Can someone explain me why does my charts won't show up by default (i have to select one to display it) ? http://jsfiddle.net/P2Nyf/
[07:01:57] <Cork> joniop: http://jsfiddle.net/P2Nyf/1/
[07:02:22] <Cork> (line 73)
[07:02:39] <joniop> what was wrong ?
[07:03:16] <Cork> you don't run the select code on page load
[07:03:27] <Cork> s/don't/didn't/
[07:03:32] <joniop> alright
[07:03:34] <joniop> thanks
[07:03:53] <joniop> and one more question ? How can i get the title to be different on each pie chart ?
[07:04:06] <joniop> ex : Market status in 2010 for 2010, etc.
[07:04:43] <joniop> i tried to put "text: 'Market status in {series.name}'" in the title
[07:04:48] <joniop> but it doesn't work
[07:05:16] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/P2Nyf/2/
[07:05:42] <Cork> there might be an automated way, but i don't know highchart
[07:05:49] <joniop> okay
[07:06:02] <joniop> but if i proceed like that, i'll still have one title for the three charts
[07:06:03] <joniop> ?
[07:06:20] <Cork> not if you set it in the separate sections
[07:06:28] <joniop> in each series then ?
[07:06:40] <Cork> yes
[07:06:41] <Cork> not in the series
[07:06:44] <Cork> but change it for each section
[07:06:52] <Cork> you already have the if cases
[07:07:16] <joniop> yeah so in each if case, i put options.title.text = '';
[07:07:21] <Cork> yes
[07:07:26] <joniop> alright, thanks
[07:09:55] <letsgohawks> (new to jquery) I have a simple todo list shown here: http://jsfiddle.net/letsGoHawks/HhruM/   I am curious why when i press enter in the textbox the page gets reloaded (and how I can change that default behavior)
[07:18:16] <fikst> letsgohawks, don't use the click event on the button, but use the submit event on the form
[07:21:57] <letsgohawks> Ahh that makes sense I changed the event handleer to this:  $('form').submit(function(){    but now it shows for a second and then reloads
[07:23:09] <letsgohawks> would event.preventDefault(); be overkill in order to stop this from happening or whould thatseem to be that correct thign to do?
[07:27:08] <fikst> preventDefault() would make sense
[07:27:52] <NoiseEee> letsgohawks: you'll notice that hitting 'enter', even if you had preventDefault(), wouldn't work with your list at all, currently
[07:28:08] <NoiseEee> letsgohawks: the correct approach is to watch the 'submit' event of the form, not the 'click' event of a submit button.
[07:28:35] <NoiseEee> letsgohawks: also, if you're learning jquery, use '.on' instead of things like $(el).click
[07:28:51] <NoiseEee> letsgohawks: $(el).on('click',function() { //etc })

[07:41:41] <chinoto> Anyone used jqGrid before? (Typing question...)
[07:42:05] <jop008> what is good code for an image carousel in jqmobile?
[07:43:57] <boytoy> jop008: slidesjs.com by far i think
[07:44:46] <boytoy> jop008: theres also swipejs and responsiveslides but in the end slidesjs was the one that made the cut
[07:45:13] <chinoto> Some of the jqgrid columns are not going to be directly related to the data received, I'm wondering how to deal with this. I was considering for any derived columns that I would just put extra data in them and use formatter to render what I need from all the columns.

[07:45:54] <chinoto> s/all the columns/the row data/

[07:46:56] <boytoy> chinoto: grids are excellent for graphic design theory (http://www.subtraction.com/pics/0703/grids_are_good.pdf) but to turn them into code is to me a lost cause

[08:04:21] <merlin1978> of a html select
[08:04:22] <KelVarnsen> is there a way to get the item before :last?
[08:06:02] <shoky> KelVarnsen: .slice(-2,-1)

[08:06:25] <CodeDEV> How do I store a jquery value in php?
[08:07:12] <NoiseEee> CodeDEV: send it to PHP in a form, or in a URL, any way you normally get a value to PHP
[08:07:33] <CodeDEV> I want to store a value in the $query so I can decide what posts to get http://pastebin.com/rZX5B2FQ

[08:16:54] <jop008> how can I test for existence of a directory?
[08:17:13] <gho5t> I'm sure there's a Directory.Exists() in php
[08:17:15] <gho5t> or something
[08:17:18] <gho5t> but this is #jquery
[08:17:58] <beasty> mm
[08:18:02] <beasty> weird
[08:18:58] <Krambiorix> hi, in autocomplete renderItem, i have an if clause, in the else i want to return false , but this throws: this._renderItem(...) is undefined   ... What can i do?
[08:19:18] <beasty> i have <li class="shop>a</li><li class="group">b</li><li class="category">c</li><li class="shop>a</li><li class="group">b</li><li class="category">c</li>
[08:19:32] <beasty> and i try to apply this on a .shop.click
[08:19:33] <shoky> `demo @ Krambiorix
[08:19:33] <b-ot> Krambiorix: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:19:41] <beasty> $(this).parent().nextUntil('.shop').find('.group').show();
[08:21:19] <Krambiorix> shoky, http://pastebin.com/5JiiRssm
[08:21:57] <shoky> beasty: .parent().next...  would look for siblings of the parent. not of the <li>
[08:22:15] <gho5t> a table wrapped in an anchor
[08:22:16] <gho5t> nice
[08:22:29] <beasty> shoky: mkay what would you sugest then ?
[08:22:45] <shoky> and a </div> from nowhere
[08:23:40] <shoky> beasty: from the html you showed..  just  skip the .parent() i guess
[08:23:58] <KelVarnsen> how do i encode the single quotes when doing a .after('<td class='test'
[08:24:20] <gho5t> KelVarnsen: ...use double quotes?
[08:24:26] <KelVarnsen> im in ASP.net
[08:24:29] <Beg__f> What event should I catch if I "click" a link and I want to see if it's finished loading?
[08:24:30] <KelVarnsen> and it hates double quotes
[08:24:45] <KelVarnsen> err im in an onclick=""
[08:24:51] <gho5t> ah
[08:24:59] <gho5t> can't you just do \'test\t ?
[08:25:07] <KelVarnsen> oh that sounds good
[08:25:20] <gho5t> \'test\' rather
[08:25:28] <beasty> shoky: neup http://jsfiddle.net/hB76V/
[08:26:09] <beasty> when i drop the .find() it finds the li's
[08:26:17] <shoky> Krambiorix: _renderItem is not the place to make that decision (to not show a certain item), _renderItem assumes it's an item you're gonna show
[08:26:46] <shoky> beasty: you didn't say you have an <a> inside
[08:27:03] <shoky> "i try to apply this on a .shop.click"
[08:27:19] <shoky> beasty: change .find to .filter
[08:28:09] <Krambiorix> shoky, where can i make that decision then?
[08:29:21] <shoky> Krambiorix:  "source" option
[08:29:42] <beasty> idd that did the trick
[08:30:39] <Krambiorix> shoky, that's a good idea!
[08:35:20] <beasty> shoky: thanks :)
[08:36:17] <KelVarnsen> can a string in JS have new lines?
[08:38:39] <Krambiorix> shoky, it works, thanks a lot!!
[08:39:27] <shoky> KelVarnsen: sure
[08:39:52] <shoky> KelVarnsen: unless you mean  var str = "hi
[08:39:58] <shoky>   bye";
[08:40:00] <KelVarnsen> yes!
[08:40:10] <KelVarnsen> is that legal?
[08:40:41] <shoky> no that's a syntax error
[08:40:41] <shoky> var str = "hi\nbye";
[08:40:47] <KelVarnsen> ah
[08:41:16] <gho5t> var str = 'hi \
[08:41:19] <gho5t> bye';
[08:41:37] <KelVarnsen> thanks
[08:41:46] <shoky> except that doesn't put a newline in the string
[08:42:43] <gho5t> I mistook his question then
[08:44:41] <shoky> whatever it is, he's now well equipped
[08:46:48] <gho5t> : )
[08:50:00] <OliverJAsh> when i use a value of `initial` in applying CSS with jquery, it just removes any inline styles. i.e.`css('display', 'initial')` will result in `<div style>`
[08:50:06] <OliverJAsh> is that documented anywhere?
[08:50:48] <BillCriswell> OliverJAsh: I don't think I follow your question..
[08:51:08] <OliverJAsh> i can't be much more explicit than that! :(
[08:51:13] <solancer> can anyone help me with this plugin
[08:51:17] <solancer> https://github.com/bigspotteddog/ScrollToFixed
[08:51:50] <solancer> using the limit option breaks the div out of the page
[08:52:22] <solancer> anyone?
[08:54:08] <BillCriswell> OliverJAsh: I think it's just consider it invlid?
[08:55:32] <BillCriswell> considers it invalid*
[08:58:52] <spencerthayer> Would anyone want to take a look at this Fiddle and help me figure out why the stored form data is not being stored in local storage http://jsfiddle.net/spencerthayer/23Wzg/ ? The idea of the script is to allow the user to restore previously saved form combinations for an application where this would be very useful.
[09:01:39] <OliverJAsh> BillCriswell: good point
[09:04:43] <Mosselmaniac> hi all
[09:05:14] <Mosselmaniac> I use jquery ui and have a dialog, where i show the ckeditor. but the style of the ckeditor is conflicting with the style of UI
[09:05:21] <Mosselmaniac> how can i prevent that jquery ui will style that ckeditor?
[09:11:20] <Mosselmaniac> can somebody help plz?
[09:12:35] <tamarche> Mosselmanic, you will probably have to do some class changes, and use a web development add on like firebug to make your css changes
[09:14:05] <RabSimpson> hi folks. i have a text input and it's currently in focus, i'd like something to happen when the value of this input changes to a specific string. the thing i want to happen i know how to do but i can't work out how to determine when the value has changed. the next element to be interacted with is a submit button which will be activated upon the value being the desired string. any ideas?
[09:15:04] <tamarche> bind the change evernt
[09:15:16] <RabSimpson> .change() ?
[09:15:27] <RabSimpson> i tried that, the button didn't become active
[09:15:59] <tamarche> Try .on
[09:17:08] <tamarche> RabSimpson: http://api.jquery.com/on/ - you can also try using keypress
[09:17:38] <RabSimpson> was just looking that page up :) trying it out now
[09:18:23] <tamarche> RabSimpson: Excellent, let me know how it goes
[09:21:28] <RabSimpson> tamarche: .on( "keyup" did the trick :)
[09:21:43] <tamarche> RabSimpson: Awesome!
[09:22:38] <RabSimpson> thanks for your help :)
[09:24:54] <tamarche> =]
[09:25:45] <spencerthayer> Too bad
[09:26:14] <tamarche> Oh
[09:26:22] <tamarche> spencerthayer, I could not access your jfiddle link
[09:30:51] <BAMbanda> I was wondering if anyone has used jquery with xul for firefox extension development?
[09:34:49] <Mosselmaniac> getting crazy here
[09:38:22] <BAMbanda> I was wondering if anyone has used jquery with xul for firefox extension development?
[09:40:53] <spencerthayer> tamarche weird. One second...
[09:41:04] <spencerthayer> http://jsfiddle.net/spencerthayer/23Wzg/
[09:43:48] <spencerthayer> Thanks
[09:52:25] <tamarche> spencerthayer: Is it just me, or does it actually work in the jsfiddle example but not on a local example
[09:53:14] <spencerthayer> Nah I cannot get it to work on the JSFiddle example at all. After a refresh all the stored values are lost. Is it working on yours?
[09:53:35] <spencerthayer> And it's not working on my local html either
[09:53:49] <tamarche> Okay
[09:54:05] <tamarche> You are saying you want form data saved after refresh
[09:54:18] <tamarche> ?
[09:55:43] <skione> Hi, I need to add items to an array and then subsiquently iterate through those items and add them to variable. I am a little fuzzy on the syntax: http://pastebin.com/7zinP5L0 I really thought this would work
[09:57:41] <tamarche> What error are you getting/
[09:57:49] <tamarche> skione
[09:57:52] <skione> the alert never fires
[09:57:58] <tamarche> You are also missing a semi-colon after the each =p
[09:58:29] <skione> its like the array is empty, and the ; didn't do it tamarche
[09:58:47] <skione> however when I log it to the console it looks like the data is there
[09:58:49] <tamarche> skione: yes the semi-colon rarely fixes all issues lol
[09:59:52] <tamarche> skione, have you tried using a standard for loop for the finished array?
[10:00:20] <skione> no I can try that
[10:00:27] <skione> you'd think .each would work tho
[10:00:32] <tamarche> Also it looks like if you have ANY object with class aff_require with no value, it won't fire at all
[10:01:20] <tamarche> h
[10:01:23] <tamarche> Nevermind, i read that wrong
[10:01:27] <tamarche> Disregard that one
[10:01:31] <skione> sure
[10:02:16] <tamarche> Also, do you have an html example?
[10:02:59] <skione> the html is inside a lightbox so its hard to give it, suffice it to say it otherwise works
[10:03:22] <tamarche> I see
[10:05:02] <skione> if I log the array I get this: http://pastebin.com/7hzc5t1e
[10:05:27] <skione> I think I might be trying to this the wrong way now that I think of it
[10:06:44] <spencerthayer> ]Sorry!
[10:06:49] <spencerthayer> Boss was around
[10:07:38] <Idiot> lol
[10:07:45] <Idiot> is he mad dogin u
[10:08:10] <spencerthayer> Nah
[10:08:15] <spencerthayer> Just had to talk.
[10:08:16] <BAMbanda> I was wondering if anyone has used jquery with xul for firefox extension development?
[10:08:44] <Idiot> our it exec was super doggin me lol

[10:09:07] <Idiot> he turned his dead down lol
[10:09:09] <Idiot> head
[10:09:15] <superdo> hi
[10:09:32] <superdo> is it possible that next to Datatables I cant run my own jquery routines?
[10:09:55] <spencerthayer> I am actually not getting an error for http://jsfiddle.net/spencerthayer/23Wzg/ it simply isn't doing what I expect it to. Each time I hit store values it should put that field combination below. Then a user can choose which combination they want to restore at a later time. The field combinations values should be stored in localStorage but upon refresh all of the saved values are lost.
[10:10:41] <tamarche> You cannot save data through a refresh of the page
[10:10:46] <tamarche> Unless you store it to session
[10:11:00] <Idiot> localstorage is a cookie
[10:11:04] <Idiot> not a session
[10:11:11] <tamarche> Ah I see
[10:11:29] <Idiot> anyhow u gaize will figure it
[10:11:34] <Idiot> i trust u
[10:12:12] <spencerthayer> I am not trying to save it through the refresh. When the user choose save value it should be putting that value into localStorage.
[10:15:47] <spencerthayer> How would I put all that data being generated into localStorage for retrieval later?
[10:16:51] <lord4163> How do I loop through all items in the my <nav> element?
[10:17:26] <tw2113> do you have an object with all of the items?
[10:18:06] <tamarche> something to the effect of $('nav').children().each(function() {});
[10:18:10] <tamarche> I would think
[10:18:48] <lord4163> tamarche: Ok thank you I need to check what Item get's hovered in the menubar.
[10:18:56] <tamarche> spencerthayer: Where are you calling localStorage?
[10:19:52] <tw2113> why not just use .on('hover') for that
[10:20:13] <spencerthayer> I thought wherever I was using data[$input.attr( but apparently that isn't how one uses localstorage/
[10:20:23] <lord4163> tw2113: Then I have to do that function for each menu item?
[10:21:12] <tw2113> what function
[10:21:23] <tamarche> .on('hover') will fire for any element you attach to it
[10:21:47] <tamarche> $('nav li').on('hover') will fire anytime you hover over an li element in nav
[10:21:55] <tw2113> ^
[10:27:06] <lord4163> Hmmm
[10:27:58] <lord4163> tamarche: It doesn't work :P Should I add .each as well?
[10:28:00] <zizzl> Hey guys I am using a jQuery accordion on some page content, each having various sized content in each. When I click one, is it possible to have the window of the screen align to the top of that header? A lot of times I'm on an area with a lot of content and click on one without a lot, the window will be way below any content
[10:28:57] <tamarche> lord4163: What doesn't work? The event not firing? The selector not working? Which part?
[10:29:37] <lord4163> tamarche: I don't really know what's going wrong http://fabianbakkum.dyndns.org:8080/max/
[10:31:18] <spencerthayer> Food time.
[10:31:56] <lord4163> tamarche: nothing happens when I hover it?
[10:32:59] <tamarche> One second
[10:34:26] <lord4163> tamarche: Okay
[10:35:27] <tw2113> switch to .hover(function(){
[10:35:38] <tw2113> maybe hover doesn't work with on() like i would think
[10:36:02] <tamarche> ^
[10:36:04] <tamarche> it works that way for me
[10:36:16] <tamarche> just tried that

[11:50:00] <jstout24> i'm dynamically injecting a jquery plugin to cache-bust it… but the plugin is undefined.. anyone know how to do this

[11:50:36] <skione> darkPassenger I forgot the link in my original question
[11:50:45] <skione> jstout24 is the link present?
[11:50:57] <skione> I mean is the file present when you click on the link?
[11:52:00] <jstout24> i have no clue what you're talking about
[11:52:40] <skione> I don't know what you mean by a plugin being undefined, so I can thing maybe its not being found, that is your path is wrong?
[11:55:14] <jnhghy> I'm using javascript .load(htmlfile.html) to load a sketch tool, the thing is I need to start it multiple times and the 2nd, 3rd... time I load it,it saves the sketch in the html.... is there a way to unload it? or to make .load overwrite it?
[11:55:46] <skione> you could empty() it
[12:01:27] <jnhghy> how can I read an html file in a variable to be used for loading a div? something like var A = somehow("file.html"); $("#divid").load(A); ?
[12:02:05] <skione> I would think that would work

[12:10:46] <ckknight> hey, anyone know a good way to make it so an input box will fill with previously submitted text when one presses the up arrow? I know I could code this on my own, just wondering if someone else has done it already.
[12:18:34] <lasha> ckknight: good question. i'm also wondering that
[12:20:25] <tamarche> ckknight: you mean previous submissions from other people?
[12:20:32] <ckknight> no
[12:20:47] <ckknight> I'm creating a webapp that includes a chat portion
[12:21:05] <tamarche> Oh so an input that saves previous entries
[12:21:05] <ckknight> one would type repeatedly into an input box, which would be transmitted to the server (no page refresh)
[12:21:07] <ckknight> yes
[12:21:34] <tamarche> I am not aware of anything that is prebuilt already for that =[
[12:22:14] <ckknight> was hoping for a plugin or something
[12:22:14] <ckknight> oh well
[12:22:31] <lasha> on adium and ichat
[12:22:38] <lasha> pressing option + up key
[12:22:41] <lasha> does it lol
[12:22:46] <lasha> just to give u ideas for UX
[12:22:58] <ckknight> in Linkinus, it's just the up arrow
[12:23:01] <ckknight> that's my plan
[12:23:25] <tamarche> You should write a jquery plugin ;-)
[12:24:33] <ravenzz> ckknight you could "borrow" it from plugins like this http://terminal.jcubic.pl/#demo
[12:25:13] <skione> looks like jquery has a queue, you could add items to it and then iterate back http://api.jquery.com/clearQueue/
[12:25:50] <skione> ckknight
[12:25:59] <ravenzz> I would use localstorage (as it would allow you to emulate the bash history thing)
[12:26:17] <lasha> yea that's easily the easiest route :D
[12:30:37] <ckknight> ravenzz: nah, I'm gonna have the server transmit the history back on page load rather than localstorage
[12:31:02] <ckknight> basically, I'm writing a web-based IRC client that keeps your state based on the user you logged in with (using OpenID)
[12:32:22] <smallfoot-> Can I match with a selector <b>foo<i>bar</i></b>, I want only match inside <b> but not children of <b> ?
[12:32:38] <Gmac_> anyone here good with touch events?
[12:32:59] <dabear> smallfoot-: you can
[12:33:04] <smallfoot-> dabear, how?
[12:33:25] <gho5t> .text()
[12:33:25] <b-ot> gho5t: usually nicer
[12:33:27] <dabear> so you want to select all immediate text inside a selector, but not any children?
[12:33:36] <smallfoot-> dabear, exactly!
[12:33:47] <ravenzz> ckknight ah ok, it should take more than 30min to code such functionality though
[12:33:55] <ckknight> yeah, I'm almost done
[12:34:17] <Gmac_> anyone good with touch events? cause i created a touch move event and its duplicaintg...
[12:34:20] <ckknight> just wanted to check if there was a plugin already available before I started
[12:34:32] <ravenzz> at least it is your code, same style of the rest etc
[12:34:36] <dabear> smallfoot-: select element, use .contents() to get all contents including text nodes
[12:34:55] <dabear> and filter out the other nodes
[12:35:39] <ravenzz> ckknight and remember to open source it! I might find myself looking for something similar in the future :p
[12:35:52] <ckknight> perhaps if I separate it from my current code
[12:36:06] <ckknight> also, I'm coding in a compile-to-JS language, people generally don't like plugins and such from those.
[12:43:15] <batman22> am i missing a return false in this function since the record is being deleted but ajaxEmployees is not displaying the correct html after the response is being sent http://jsfiddle.net/NcSVv/
[12:44:56] <gho5t> i think you need resp.data
[12:47:27] <gho5t> maybe not
[12:47:27] <gho5t> I'm rusty
[12:47:37] <batman22> um?
[12:48:14] <gho5t> log resp
[12:48:17] <gho5t> see what it is
[12:49:16] <Pavlov> is there anything I can do to make clicking on a button -> opening a popup faster with jquery mobile/
[12:49:26] <Pavlov> there is super noticable delay of focus change, etc
[12:49:48] <arschmitz> pavlov are you supporting desktop?
[12:49:57] <Pavlov> arschmitz: not really
[12:50:06] <Pavlov> but the delay is noticable on desktop
[12:50:15] <Pavlov> more noticable, on mobile
[12:50:29] <alainus> how do I convert "$2.99" to 2.99 float?
[12:50:30] <arschmitz> no do you SUPPORT desktop in your project
[12:50:41] <Pavlov> arschmitz: for testing only
[12:50:44] <batman22> gho5t:  im being redirected automatically to http://localhost/project/controllers/deleteEmployees.php?id=25
[12:51:01] <arschmitz> there is a way to make it faster but it will make it not possible to open the popup on desktop
[12:51:19] <Pavlov> arschmitz: how?
[12:51:32] <arschmitz> instead of using a link with an id for href
[12:52:03] <arschmitz> use either a button or a link with data-ajax=false and bind to the touchstart event on that element
[12:52:34] <arschmitz> note this will fail on many old BB devices as well as all windows phones
[12:52:49] <arschmitz> anything that does not support touch events
[12:53:03] <arschmitz> but it eliminates the 300ms click delay
[12:53:25] <arschmitz> so best for phonegap apps really
[12:53:47] <Pavlov> $( '#popup' ).popup( 'open' ) or something?
[12:53:54] <arschmitz> yes
[12:56:22] <ericfilkins> I've created a photo tagging system using jquery, however I need the past tags to show up. I made an iteration that goes through all the tags and finds the x-y coordinates but I'm stuck on how to display them. I was wondering if anyone could help me
[12:56:34] <ericfilkins> a rails iteration*
[12:59:01] <ericfilkins_> hello
[12:59:30] <smallfoot-> can I do anything more pleasant than .toggle() ?
[13:00:27] <ericfilkins_> .fade() i believe?
[13:00:37] <smallfoot-> oh .toggle(200) works too
[13:00:55] <smallfoot-> would be nice with expand/collapse tho
[13:00:59] <DarkGhost`> hello is it possible to do a selector something like: $("input[name='*_counter']") to get all input's with a _coutner in the name?
[13:02:24] <Pavlov> arschmitz: even just attaching a click handler is making it way faster
[13:02:26] <Pavlov> whats up with that?
[13:02:49] <arschmitz> your not going through the navigation stack
[13:03:13] <Beg__f> So guys, i seem to have performance issues when I load a iframe to frequently, is it possible to disable javascript execution in a iframe?
[13:03:23] <Pavlov> hmm
[13:03:30] <Pavlov> that doesn't seem to break anything
[13:04:01] <arschmitz> it wont break anything thats perfectly supported
[13:05:01] <arschmitz> it just skips all the call overhead
[13:05:36] <DarkGhost`> anyone?
[13:07:20] <Tomashe> Hey guys anyone worked with Pjax?
[13:07:34] <gho5t> DarkGhost`: yes
[13:07:35] <Tomashe> or know any other way to do the same
[13:10:35] * BillCriswell wants to nap
[13:22:22] <c4ptnh00k> I want to listen to the inputs within a particular div and if one of those inputs has changed show an update button. is there a way to do this in jquery?
[13:22:47] <c4ptnh00k> perferably without listening to each individual input
[13:22:47] <khmer> um, well
[13:23:04] <ericfilkins_> divname.change(function(){your function here};
[13:23:08] <ericfilkins_> or something like that
[13:23:10] <ericfilkins_> haha
[13:23:28] <khmer> $('#the-div').on('change', 'input', function() { $('#update-button').show(); });
[13:23:42] <ericfilkins_> ^ (y)
[13:23:56] <ericfilkins_> can anyone help me with for loops?
[13:24:02] <khmer> maybe?
[13:24:09] <c4ptnh00k> awesome
[13:24:17] <c4ptnh00k> what about for loops
[13:24:19] <c4ptnh00k> ?
[13:24:35] <ericfilkins_> im trying to cycle through a series of image tags and get their x-y coordinates
[13:25:46] <ericfilkins_> I created an erb iteration that goes through all the tags and finds the x-y coordinates but I'm stuck on how to display them.
[13:26:08] <maxmoore14> using html5 apis and jquery as needed, does anyone know if there is a relatively straightforward way to read text out of a Word doc? I'm thinking that using the FileAPI would make it pretty easy to read a plain text file. But not sure if there is a good way to deal with more complex files.
[13:26:49] <c4ptnh00k>  ericfilkins: maybe something like this ? $('#container img').each(function() {alert($(this).attr('src'))});
[13:27:03] <khmer> ericfilkins_: ah, if you want to do that in erb you should ask ##ruby?
[13:27:14] <maxmoore14> goal is: <input type="file">, user selects file, I read contents and insert into textarea
[13:27:15] <khmer> maxmoore14: a .docx?
[13:27:26] <maxmoore14> khmer: sure
[13:27:38] <ericfilkins_> alrighty, thanks!
[13:27:46] <khmer> maxmoore14: you really gotta do that on the server side
[13:27:46] <maxmoore14> khmer: basically I want to support as many "text" file types as I can
[13:28:21] <maxmoore14> was afraid you'd say that
[13:28:25] <khmer> maxmoore14: that said: http://blog.innovatejs.com/?p=184
[13:31:29] <maxmoore14> khmer: cool, thanks. I'm not crazy about using another library for a minor feature of my app, but I'll take a look
[13:32:24] <ericfilkins> the erb iteration however creates span tags, one with the x coordinate, and one with the y coordinate i figured i could use jquery to pull out the coordinates and then map the tag again
[13:32:27] <khmer> maxmoore14: that's a major feature!
[13:33:06] <maxmoore14> khmer: I just mean it is minor from my users perspective
[13:33:25] <khmer> i rather think that's an argument TO use a library
[13:33:36] <khmer> if it's not important to your users, why not save yourself the development time and use an external tool?
[13:35:55] <maxmoore14> fair enough
[13:36:50] <ericfilkins> is this the proper way to alert a variable value?
[13:36:52] <ericfilkins>     alert(connection.val());
[13:40:22] <ericfilkins> how does one alert the value of a variable
[13:40:36] <gho5t> you just did it
[13:40:54] <shoky> ericfilkins: what do you mean by the value of a variable?  cause the proper way to see a general variable's value is to console.log(variable)
[13:41:31] <ericfilkins> ahh i see, so is it considered bad practice to do something like: alert(myVariable.val());
[13:41:44] <ericfilkins> or is that even correct? haha sorry im new to jquery
[13:41:45] <shoky> .val() is for jquery objects..
[13:41:51] <shoky> variables have nothing to do with jquery
[13:42:25] <gho5t> yah
[13:42:29] <shoky> var x = "hi";  console.log(x);
[13:42:42] <shoky> basic javascript
[13:42:50] <ericfilkins> oh okay, thanks
[13:43:16] <shoky> (and you see the log in your browser's console)
[13:43:55] <ericfilkins> gotcha, thank you
[13:48:58] <eigentor> Am trying to learn some very basic stuff. Why does console.log not show the number, and I cannot insert it into the page  with .after() if I write it like this? http://pastebin.com/d7DQuX0y
[13:49:35] <eigentor> If I put the console.log inside one of the click functions, it works
[13:49:43] <eigentor> But I thought the variable was global?
[13:51:18] <shoky> eigentor: once you put it in the DOM, it's no longer connected to the variable
[13:51:46] <shoky> eigentor: you'd have to update the DOM with the new number on each click
[13:52:18] <eigentor> alright
[13:52:47] <eigentor> So I have to connect my functions by themselves and write it to the dom only in the end
[13:52:47] <shoky> (and same goes for the console, usually)
[13:53:04] <eigentor> thx shoky
[13:53:07] <shoky> donno what you mean
[13:55:46] <funkt> http://jsfiddle.net/NtKHT/ < Hi there I am trying to highlight the current tab but it seems to highlight and then keep on highlighting would anyone have any ideas?
[13:58:49] <mentoc> I have a div that displays behind a table. It's not pushing the table down but rather hiding behind it
[13:58:51] <pixelpimp> funkt: there is no .tabs .nav .a on line 23 of your js, so you're not really removing that class
[13:59:08] <mentoc> How do I make it push the table down?
[13:59:18] <funkt> oh
[14:00:00] <mentoc> would "display:block" work? Not entirely sure what display:block does
[14:00:02] <funkt> Oh i see
[14:00:13] <funkt> I need to make those classes
[14:00:56] <mentoc> My div only shows up behind the table if I put "float:right" on it
[14:01:34] <shoky> mentoc: you can wrap that div in another non-floating div
[14:01:52] <mentoc> shoky: hmmmmmm... I think you're onto something
[14:01:59] <mentoc> one sec, let me try this out
[14:02:00] <shoky> er or but  clear:both  or whatever that is on the table, i suppose
[14:02:08] <shoky> put*
[14:02:19] <shoky> or maybe there's a better way, i forget
[14:03:23] <mentoc> shoky: clear:both worked..
[14:03:25] <funkt> thank you pixelpimp learnt something!! cheers for your help works a treat
[14:07:06] <obenns> Who wants to help me with an .offset() / .scrollto() issue ? :)
[14:08:58] <CWSpear> I do I do!
[14:09:07] <pixelpimp> depends what it is!
[14:16:08] <obenns> Well....
[14:16:40] <CWSpear> I'm losing interest
[14:16:51] <obenns> My new site is situated here for the time being. If you click the nav (contact or work) you'll notice it scrolls down. However for some reason the text doesnt change to blue
[14:16:52] <obenns> http://www.oliverbenns.com/new_site/
[14:17:19] <obenns> Although i've coded it (i thought I'd had) so that it changes when it reaches that point
[14:17:27] <CWSpear> what text doesn't change to blue? and by blue, do you mean turqoise?
[14:17:53] <cameron262> im using this script: http://jsfiddle.net/98sAG/ but i tried copying it over to my js file and it doesnt seem to work, i get an error "Cannot read property 'left' of undefined on functions.js:7" which is:
[14:17:54] <obenns> Yes turqoise
[14:17:57] <cameron262> return [ [ pos.left, pos.left + width ], [ pos.top, pos.top + height ] ];
[14:18:01] <cameron262> but i dont think it shouldnt even need that line?
[14:18:02] <obenns> JS is here http://www.oliverbenns.com/new_site/assets/js/scripts.js
[14:19:22] <obenns> Ctrl + F "Navigation auto change 'active' state on user scroll" and you'll find the area
[14:23:52] <HarryPitfall> obenns: I didn't know that set css sizes without "px" at end works...
[14:24:24] <obenns> Yeah I found that on a Google too.
[14:24:45] <obenns> I'm not sure how to add 'px' to the offset value. Guess I'll have to change it to a string and mess about or something?
[14:24:47] <pixelpimp> obenns: you're checking the value at the very top of the screen; when you scroll to contact/blog, they're not quite up that high
[14:25:25] <pixelpimp> add a big margin-bottom to your body and you can see it 'fixes' it
[14:25:35] <obenns> pixelpimp: Should they not though?
[14:27:47] <pixelpimp> try adding the window height to doc_pos in your .scroll() function
[14:28:03] <pixelpimp> which should see if things are past the bottom of the screen, rather than past the top
[14:29:42] <obenns> pixelpimp: No luck on the margin
[14:30:32] <pixelpimp> really?  worked for me
[14:31:01] <pixelpimp> I set it to 40em, then scrolled past contact
[14:34:19] <obenns> pixelpimp: Oh I can scroll past it ok
[14:34:38] <obenns> pixelpimp: and it changes, it was ok anyway. It's just on the 'click' that it fails to work
[14:34:50] <obenns> pixelpimp: something to do with that position
[14:36:22] <obenns> Tried var doc_pos= $(window).scrollTop(); but no luck :S
[14:36:30] <BillCriswell> I kind of forgot I was logged in here today.
[14:36:54] <binaryfus10nz> plz see this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVMevwlYM8Q 1st 8 seconds notice the motion graphics... do you think anything close is possible with CSS3/JS/some graphic files?
[14:37:18] <BillCriswell> CSS Lens Flare?
[14:37:24] <Idiot> lol
[14:37:26] <Idiot> dont
[14:37:40] <pixelpimp> obenns: looks like you just have to click it and scroll one pixel
[14:38:17] <obenns> pixelpimp: Exactly.
[14:38:37] <BillCriswell> Later on, peoples.
[14:39:16] <pixelpimp> Don't see where that 1px comes into play, but a quick fix would be to just subtract a few...
[14:39:45] <obenns> pixelpimp: How can i go about doing that as the offset value returns both X and Y coords?
[14:39:50] <cameron262> when i do $('#element2').position();
[14:40:05] <edoop> any idea  to make a left top  sticket?
[14:40:06] <cameron262> i get 153.59 as the left value, even though it is clearly right next tot he edge
[14:40:09] <edoop> sticker?
[14:40:34] <cameron262> oh wait
[14:40:37] <cameron262> because of my margin-left
[14:40:40] <cameron262> ARGH
[14:40:45] <CWSpear> obenns, sorry, I was AFK
[14:40:58] <CWSpear> did you get it figured out? have you used waypoints.js before? might help with some of that
[14:41:17] <pixelpimp> obenns: don't quite know what you mean by that last question
[14:41:19] <obenns> CWSpear: No no luck on this, it's really odd and infuriating! Lol
[14:42:14] <pixelpimp> edoop: if you want something to be fixed position, CSS is probably your better choice
[14:42:36] <edoop> pixelpimp: yes i  want to set in top
[14:42:39] <obenns> pixelpimp: Sorry. So .offset() returns the X and Y co-ordinates
[14:43:11] <obenns> pixelpimp: oh wait brb
[14:44:11] <TigerParket> Hello guys, please what's wront with my spaghetti code http://pastebin.com/wzfLFKgq
[14:44:13] <obenns> pixelpimp: Thought I could just do .offset().top - 20 but apparently not :(
[14:46:08] <zizzl> hey guys I have this jQuery('.red-line-title').css('color','#e02f00').delay(800).css('color','#000000'); inside of an on() click... I want it to change colors then wait and change another color, what am I doing wrong here... sorry I'm learning
[14:47:46] <pixelpimp> obenns: i would think you could do that!  :/
[14:47:56] <TigerParket> no one for mine ?
[14:48:21] <obenns> pixelpimp: Really irritating this is!
[14:48:24] <grafi> doesnt even look like valid javascript TigerParket any errors on the console?
[14:49:20] <pixelpimp> zizzl: .delay() only works with the effects queue, which .css() won't affect
[14:49:31] <obenns> TigerParket: function(izi()) { should be function izi() {
[14:49:33] <grafi> zizzl http://api.jquery.com/delay/ afaik delay only works on e.g. the animation queue and .css ... pixelpimp was faster ...
[14:49:35] <grafi> <.<
[14:49:43] <zizzl> pixelpimp ahh ok that make sense
[14:49:53] <TigerParket> grafi what i want to do is, on resize or on load detect window width and apply something
[14:50:11] <grafi> i can see that
[14:50:25] <zizzl> grafi & pixelpimp thanks guys how can I acheive this? I am basically doing an on click that I want to highlight an an area then go back to the original color after a second
[14:51:21] <grafi> setTimeout should help you out
[14:51:21] <pixelpimp> zizzl: use .anim() or a javascript timeout
[14:52:52] <zizzl> agh wish I knew how to do so.. I'll do some reading thanks
[14:53:14] <maxmoore14> is it possible to prevent mobile browsers from trying to handle long holds? I've tried -webkit-user-select: none but that isn't working for me
[14:54:04] <maxmoore14> testing on Android 4.1.2
[14:56:32] <mentoc> in PHP I can do this: $foo = 'func'; $$foo(); <-- calls 'func'
[14:56:52] <mentoc> is there a way to dynamically generate a function to call by variable value?]
[14:57:46] <pixelpimp> obenns: line 51, you can add the 20px there! :)
[14:58:06] <shoky> mentoc:  obj[ funcNameVariable ]()  where obj is an object.  if the function is global you can window[func]()
[14:58:14] <pixelpimp> obenns: line 51--> $('html, body').animate({scrollTop:position[i] + 20 + 'px'}, 'slow');
[14:58:57] <mentoc> shoky: does funcNameVariable have to be a member of obj?
[14:59:08] <shoky> mentoc: the function does, yeah
[14:59:43] <myosotis> right now I'm executing $(selector).each(); to set up a number of widgets on a page. Unfortunately some of the widgets are loaded after the fact by various javascript.
[14:59:50] <shoky> e.g. var obj = { f: function() {} };   var x = 'f';  obj[f]()
[15:00:00] <shoky> i mean obj[x]()  ;P
[15:00:11] <mentoc> heh
[15:00:19] <obenns> pixelpimp: Awesome!!!!!!!!!
[15:00:37] <myosotis> How can I handle this situation? I'm familiar with event delegation
[15:01:04] <shoky> myosotis:  handle what about it?
[15:01:10] <obenns> pixelpimp: I changed it to + 1 . It is literally 1px! what is up with that
[15:01:17] <myosotis> I just need to do 'things' to it when it's created
[15:01:54] <maxmoore14> anyone know how to disable long holds in mobile browsers?
[15:01:57] <myosotis> I think I need to listen for some 'dom element added' event on a higher level dom element
[15:02:04] <shoky> myosotis: if the creation stuff is async, then the plugin should provide you a way to supply a callback
[15:02:04] <pixelpimp> bizarre... mostly that it was only the one
[15:02:23] <shoky> myosotis: no that's not a good solution, at least right now
[15:02:29] <myosotis> negative on the callback, wasn't designed with this in mind.
[15:02:50] <shoky> myosotis:  the creation is async?
[15:03:11] <myosotis> yes, it's created via user action
[15:03:26] <myosotis> user clicky something, not-an-iframe popup comes up and loads an html snippet from the server
[15:04:10] <myosotis> hmm, I'll make a fiddle about it tomorrow I suppose
[15:04:40] <obenns> pixelpimp: I'm going to try and figure it out but that is deffo a temp solution. Thanks so much mate I appreciate it
[15:04:41] <shoky> there's no good cross-browser way to detect dom changes. use a better plugin if the one you're using doesn't provide you with this basic hook
[15:06:32] <boytoy> hey shoky, i found a solution to the mobile scrolling on youtube embeds thing!
[15:06:51] <grafi> zizzl http://jsfiddle.net/a7PBS/
[15:06:55] <shoky> boytoy: cool glad you got it sorted
[15:07:15] <boytoy> shoky: yup, it was a pay service though

[15:13:18] <mentoc> Would it be far-fetched if I said that jquery is a conspiracy to keep people away from pure javascript and to weaken the entire world for sudden takeover by assembly coders?
[15:13:54] <shoky> jquery IS pure javascript
[15:14:17] <snover> if you have to ask
[15:14:26] <khmer> nope, john resig used special hypnotism magic
[15:14:49] <khmer> other libraries are sets of reasonable convenience functions
[15:14:52] <khmer> jquery is LIES for IDIOTS
[15:16:17] <Idiot> who called me
[15:16:32] * khmer whistles nonchalantly
[15:16:42] <mentoc> rofl
[15:16:46] <Idiot> -.^
[15:16:55] <mentoc> yes, at you Idiot.;
[15:16:58] <chovy> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'createDocumentFragment' of undefined
[15:17:07] <chovy> anyone get this erro in jQuery 2.03?
[15:18:04] <khmer> chovy: that could happen if you brought it into a closure where "document" had been redefined as undefined
[15:19:51] <chovy> khmer: i don't know what that means
[15:20:14] <khmer> chovy: i've never gotten that error, but how are you bringing in jquery and what other scripts are running on the page?
[15:20:25] <chovy> a bunch of shit
[15:20:29] <chovy> jquery plugins
[15:20:31] <chovy> backbone
[15:22:21] <khmer> any custom scripts?
[15:22:26] <khmer> is jquery being injected by anything?
[15:22:44] <chovy> yes
[15:22:48] <chovy> we have a custom package loader
[15:23:01] <khmer> it's redefining "document"
[15:23:04] <khmer> look into it
[15:23:44] <mentoc> why would you redefine document ?
[15:23:46] <chovy> what changed between 1.7.1 and 1.10.2 that would cause this?
[15:24:27] <CWSpear> chovy, quite a bit. Are you using the migration plugin? It fills in the stuff they removed and gives you a warning in the console
[15:24:34] <shoky> chovy:  could be something like this  http://jsfiddle.net/jegYG/1/
[15:25:24] <chovy> shoky. i don't understand what this fiddle is supposed to show
[15:25:59] <khmer> this does expose a bug in jquery though
[15:26:10] <shoky> chovy: it shows the same error
[15:26:13] <khmer> it shouldn't count on "document" being available
[15:26:23] <khmer> it should get the root object and get document as a property off it
[15:26:47] <chovy> maybe Backbone is breaking it
[15:26:49] <shoky> chovy: here's how some faulty code could do it by accident  http://jsfiddle.net/jegYG/2/
[15:28:27] <chovy> $targ.after($over);.
[15:28:34] <chovy> doesn't like that line i guess
[15:28:58] <shoky> console.log( $targ[0] )  before that line
[15:30:21] <chovy> Window {top: Window, window: Window, location: Location, external: Object, chrome: Object…}
[15:30:36] <shoky> there you go
[15:30:55] <khmer> chovy: yeah...in a console in your broken thing, see what "document" is
[15:31:13] <shoky> $(window).after( ... )  causes the same error
[15:31:27] <chovy> $targ = $( targ == 'window' ? window : targ )
[15:31:38] <chovy> i don't see how that would break.
[15:31:43] <shoky> you can't  add DOM to the window/after the window
[15:31:49] <shoky> only to the document and its descendants
[15:32:09] <chovy> oh i see
[15:32:12] <chovy> hmmm
[15:32:19] <chovy> wtf was i thinking when i wrote this.
[15:32:28] <khmer> ooh i know
[15:32:30] <shoky> ;p
[15:32:30] <khmer> you were thinking
[15:32:37] * khmer . o O (             )
[15:34:34] <chovy> i am trying to get middle of window
[15:37:16] <chovy> does $(document).after work?
[15:37:22] <chovy> i'm getting same error
[15:37:42] <shoky> . o O (             ) (                                                                                            )
[15:38:14] <shoky> what does it mean to add something after the document?
[15:38:37] <chovy> so i guess I need to make this function of a child of body.
[15:38:39] <shoky> just add stuff to other elements e.g. <body>
[15:38:58] <chovy> i don't know why it worked off window in 1.7.1
[15:39:05] <chovy> but it did.
[15:39:10] <shoky> what did it do
[15:39:20] <chovy> it just worked.
[15:39:26] <chovy> put the overlay in the body I guess.
[15:39:40] <shoky> nah http://jsfiddle.net/nZBFt/
[15:39:41] <cameron262> i have 10 elements and i want to check if they overlap, i can compare 2 elements to see fit ehy overlap, but this way i would have to loop 45 times to check that there's no overlaps between all of them
[15:39:44] <cameron262> is there a faster way?
[15:41:06] <shoky> what do you want to check exactly?
[15:42:29] <cameron262> shoky, that the elements dont overlap
[15:42:49] <shoky> that none of the 10 elements overlap with any of the others?
[15:42:53] <cameron262> yes
[15:42:58] <cameron262> and if they do i sort it
[15:43:26] <cameron262> i've got overlap checking working, but im trying to work out the most efficient way to actually sort it out
[15:43:33] <shoky> there's more efficient ways to do that yeah, i'm too tired to work it out tho
[15:43:49] <cameron262> oh ok
[15:43:56] <cameron262> could you point me in the right direction?
[15:43:59] <cameron262> or anyone else?
[15:44:03] <shoky> you gotta pre-sort the left/top and uhh
[15:44:09] <shoky> i'll look it up :p
[15:44:17] <grafi> still tired shoky? you should go to bed :P
[15:44:46] <shoky> heh i've slept ;p but will do so again in a bit
[15:44:54] <grafi> good job
[15:44:55] <grafi> ^^
[15:49:10] <cameron262> shoky, any idea?
[15:51:57] <shoky> cameron262: sorry too tired to think straight about it. but are you sure you need to optimize it?
[15:52:13] <cameron262> well i might have like 30 elements
[15:52:16] <cameron262> will it be really slow?
[15:52:22] <shoky> gotcha
[15:52:28] <mentoc> shoky: mtn dew, redbull, and ketchup spaghetti
[15:52:36] <grafi> ketchup spaghetti?
[15:52:48] <cameron262> does anyone else know how i can do this: i have 10 elements on a page, what's the best way to check that none of them overlap each other, and if they do, sort it out?
[15:52:58] <shoky> cameron262: well if you do it just once, no. but if you do it many times per second, it could slow things down a bit yea
[15:53:10] <mentoc> grafi: the ketchup serves as a substitute for what normal people would use tomato sauce
[15:53:17] <cameron262> i need to do it all at once shoky
[15:53:26] <grafi> gross mentoc
[15:53:27] <grafi> :P
[15:53:35] <mentoc> :P
[15:53:35] <Idiot> ketchup is not tomato sauce lol
[15:53:37] <shoky> all at once, just once?
[15:53:49] <cameron262> all at once
[15:53:50] <mentoc> I know, but tell that to that one little girl that has her own show and modeling pagent
[15:53:58] <cameron262> all of them
[15:54:01] <mentoc> honey boo boo

[16:47:40] <ericfilkins_> does anyone know how to display past photo tags on a photo?
[16:51:14] <ericfilkins_> anyone familiar with displaying data from an erb iteration with jquery?
[17:01:34] <chovy> erb?
[17:02:11] <ericfilkins_> does anyone know how to get the data from a span tag?
[17:02:24] <chovy> $("span").attr('data-foo');
[17:03:30] <ericfilkins_> and then to log that in the console i would do console.log($("span").attr('data-foo')); right?
[17:03:38] <mike_f> I feel like a noob today...
[17:03:52] <ericfilkins_> ..me too
[17:04:27] <mike_f> I want to take 2 buttons and a checkbox and turn them into 32x32-ish pixel icon buttons...
[17:05:17] <mike_f> Exactly how I do that is escaping me.
[17:06:49] <grafi> csssssss?
[17:08:03] <tw2113> background images?
[17:08:14] <mike_f> That sounds about right.
[17:08:55] <batman22> any help here http://jsfiddle.net/qgLGD/1/
[17:10:22] <pixelpimp> ericfilkins_: that'd log to the console, but you probably have multiple spans you'd want to iterate through
[17:13:32] <Tomashe> digits: function( value, element ) {return this.optional(element) || /^\d+$/.test(value);	}
[17:13:37] <Tomashe> this is for digit only
[17:13:47] <Tomashe> how can i do for letters only?
[17:14:14] <True_Evangelion> is it possible to do something like "if ($("#id1").blur or $("#id2").blur){ do something }"?
[17:14:24] <Tomashe> will that work ? ^[a-zA-Z]+$
[17:14:51] <grafi> batman22 what seems to be the problem?
[17:15:10] <batman22> grafi:  cant get the attr
[17:15:30] <ericfilkins_> how would i iterate through? i know it would be a for loop but not sure of the syntax
[17:15:51] <grafi> works perfectly once you actually include jquery in the fiddle batman22
[17:15:54] <pixelpimp> Tomashe: should; could also try A-z
[17:17:26] <chovy> is it possible to get offset from parent inside mousemove()?
[17:18:36] <shoky> js> print(  /^[A-z]+$/.test("^_^")  )
[17:18:45] <b-ot> shoky: true
[17:20:50] <pixelpimp> True_Evangelion: make a function, set it as the callback for blur events
[17:20:54] <batman22> grafi:  sorry.. i got the wrong paste.. im wondering why it doesnt get the attr doing it this way http://jsfiddle.net/qgLGD/2/
[17:22:53] <grafi> because you dont use $(this) ... you always use $('a') which takes the first a and get the id of the parent...
[17:23:45] <batman22> grafi: using this is the only way it would work fine?
[17:24:03] <grafi> ...
[17:24:10] <grafi> obv
[17:25:14] <batman22> grafi:  im calling the function from an onclick event in the a so im not able to use this
[17:26:07] <grafi> arent you doing that in the example you gave?
[17:26:25] <pixelpimp> $(this) would be the <a> the event triggered on
[17:30:17] <batman22> grafi:  this is what im doing actually http://jsfiddle.net/qgLGD/3/
[17:31:22] <True_Evangelion> Can someone tell me why this doesn't work?
[17:31:23] <True_Evangelion> jsfiddle.net/rCyuS
[17:31:49] <pixelpimp> batman22: $(this), not $('a')
[17:32:21] <grafi> batman22 http://jsfiddle.net/qgLGD/4/
[17:32:31] <True_Evangelion> I am aware of a missing ")" in mine, it wasn't the issuse
[17:33:20] <tw2113> to help others help you, fix the issues you know about :P
[17:33:55] <True_Evangelion> I didn't notice it till now lol
[17:34:15] <True_Evangelion> I saw it on jsfiddle and I'm like "I wonder if this is why", of course, no
[17:34:34] <tw2113> just checking
[17:35:09] <pixelpimp> lots of missing );s as well
[17:35:27] <pixelpimp> for both .blur(s
[17:36:17] <True_Evangelion> really?
[17:36:17] <grafi> its a nightmare
[17:36:19] <grafi> oô
[17:37:37] <cameron262> i have 10 elements on a page, what's the best way to check that none of them overlap each other, and if they do, sort it out?
[17:38:31] <blindMoe> True_Evangelion: http://jsfiddle.net/rCyuS/5/
[17:38:42] <blindMoe> it was just the missing )'s that pixelpimp mentioned
[17:38:53] <True_Evangelion> I must of forget that
[17:39:10] <grafi> True_Evangelion http://jsfiddle.net/rCyuS/6/ probably want to check that only after the second pw field is filled out ...
[17:41:15] <True_Evangelion> thank for the help! Working fine now!
[17:54:22] <CapMax> hi
[17:54:27] <CapMax> does autoscroll work well in IE and mobile?
[17:59:56] <ericfilkins_> is there a way to test if two variables are undefined in the same if statement? so like     if (xpos && ypos !== undefined) {  console.log('X-cord : ' + xpos + ' :: ' + 'Y-cord : ' + ypos); }
[18:01:48] <pixelpimp> close, just check if both are !== undefined
[18:02:08] <pixelpimp> ((xpos !== undefined) && (ypos !== undefined))
[18:02:26] <ericfilkins_> ahhh gotcha, thanks!
[18:31:30] <nesoi> So what's the easiest way to test jquery mobile layouts and css?
[18:31:43] <nesoi> jsfiddle or is there something better?
[18:31:59] <nesoi> I need to simulate mobile phone screen sizes, etc.
[18:32:47] <pixelpimp> iframe? :)
[18:33:08] <khmer> chrome inspector?
[18:34:30] <nesoi> not debugging the code. I just want to play with the layout and css to get it to look good
[18:38:52] <pixelpimp> i use an iframe which i change to different phone screen sizes and media queries to test the size
[18:39:36] <nesoi> pixelpimp:  cool, how do you set that up?
[18:43:03] <pixelpimp> example here: http://pixelpimp.net/elements/
[18:47:09] <nesoi> beautiful… thanks!
[18:47:22] <nesoi> btw, it doesn't render properly in firefox for me for some reason
[18:49:20] <nesoi> ah, I see you know that!
[18:52:28] <ericfilkins_> i've created a for loop that iterates through a series of x-y coordinates, how would i add the coordinates to an image? (I'm in the process of building an image tagger)
[18:53:20] <ericfilkins_> would i use .position() ?
[18:54:14] <systemfault> ericfilkins_: You create a wrapper div with position:relative in it and add the image to it. Then you use divs with position: absolute as tags
[18:54:58] <systemfault> In fact, you should only need jQuery to programmatically set the "top" and "left" coordinates of the position:absolute elements
[18:57:04] <ericfilkins_> hmm ok, i think i might've stated my previous question wrong. So there has been a bunch of tags (x-y coordinates) added to the database already, but the tagger that i built does not show the tags after a page refresh. so what im trying to do is iterate through all the x-y coordinates and then add a div (the tag) at each x-y position
[18:58:03] <ericfilkins_> i guess im lost on how to take the coordinates that i have and then map each one to the image
[18:59:01] <nesoi> really beautiful work pixelpimp
[19:03:24] <ericfilkins_> on a side note, does anyone know of good jquery/ajax resources (books are also welcome) :)
[19:03:43] <doug65536> ericfilkins_: http://learn.jquery.com/
[19:04:08] <fruit_pizza> i have been doing these excercises just now http://jqexercise.droppages.com/ pretty good so far
[19:05:39] <ericfilkins_> awesome, thanks!
[19:07:38] <doug65536> I'm helping a friend get a photography website working and we want to get a "slideshow" working (where the user can click next/previous). is there a way to crossfade images without a complex system with multiple overlapping img tags?
[19:09:11] <doug65536> I have the list of images coming back as ajax and I have instantly changing images, but we want to crossfade the images and the only solution I came up with involved multiple image tags and a pair of fades to transition. is there a better way?
[19:17:40] <ericfilkins_> did a quick google search, this looks like it could be helpful: http://line25.com/tutorials/build-a-simple-image-slideshow-with-jquery-cycle
[19:19:47] <doug65536> ericfilkins_: I knew jquery would have something for that. thanks! 100x simpler than what I was going to do
[19:20:55] <ericfilkins_> np, using ajax would make that way more complicated i feel haha
[19:21:21] <binaryfus10nz> any objections on being able to build this type of preloader but with JS/CSS3 no flash http://v5.2a-archive.com/
[19:21:51] <doug65536> ericfilkins_:  the ajax is there so he can just throw more image files in a specific directory and the slideshow will update by itself. I can generate the image list with a document fragment
[19:22:39] <doug65536> ericfilkins_: it's setup so a non-programmer (my nephew) can make changes easily
[19:22:44] <ericfilkins_> ahhh I see, didnt think about that
[19:32:21] <batman22> is something wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/fj74t/
[19:35:08] <spencerthayer> batman22 I am having a similar issue. http://jsfiddle.net/spencerthayer/ZrnZ4/ deleting works for me. But it doesn't let me delete more than one at a time.
[19:38:05] <batman22> spencerthayer:  why dont you put checkboxes on each row and then select all you want to delete
[19:38:23] <spencerthayer> This is for mobile at some point.
[19:38:30] <batman22> umm
[19:40:19] <doug65536> batman22: wish is misspelled (it's not whish)
[19:41:03] <spencerthayer> :)
[19:41:24] <doug65536> batman22: missing semicolon after $.ajax call
[19:41:30] <doug65536> line 14
[19:43:14] <batman22> doug65536: lol yeah i didnt realize about the misspelling
[19:43:16] <batman22> anyways
[19:43:20] <batman22> still the same
[19:43:43] <batman22> for some reason im getting an internal server error
[19:44:15] <doug65536> batman22: how are you producing the ajax response? php?
[19:44:16] <spencerthayer> Is JSFiddle down?
[19:44:32] <doug65536> batman22: sorry, not familiar with jsfiddle
[19:44:43] <batman22> ok
[19:44:58] <batman22> doug65536:  yes php
[19:45:53] <doug65536> batman22: check the permissions on the php file. some servers are very strict about the file permissions. make sure it is not group and world write and execute are not enabled
[19:46:48] <doug65536> batman22: my isp requires 744 permissions on php files, for example
[19:47:05] <batman22> doug65536:  im testing this locally
[19:49:01] <doug65536> batman22: an 'echo "hello world" php page works?
[19:49:13] <batman22> yeah
[19:49:14] <batman22> hehe
[19:49:47] <doug65536> lol, don't laugh. it might not!
[19:49:56] <doug65536> :)
[19:52:45] <doug65536> typically, 500 error is either php not configured properly to run for the page, the file permissions, or bad http headers being emitted
[19:54:04] <doug65536> check the error log on the webserver
[20:02:59] <doug65536> batman22: you're redeclaring id. id is the parameter name and you have var id in the function too. not sure exactly how scopes will resolve if you do that
[20:04:26] <doug65536> could it be that id is garbage by the time it invokes $.ajax?
[20:05:26] <batman22> doug65536:  sorry i was doing some debugging..
[20:05:44] <batman22> doug65536:  is fine with id
[20:05:59] <batman22> anyways i have changed to check and the error persists
[20:06:02] <batman22> damn
[20:08:44] <doug65536> batman22: I just realized the fiddler code is useless. where is somepage.php
[20:23:19] <batman22> doug65536: fixed it!
[20:25:40] <doug65536> batman22: what was it?
[20:26:06] <batman22> a dumb mistake in the php query
[20:38:42] <ericfilkins_> anyone want to help me iterate a div over an image?
[20:38:52] <ericfilkins_> i asked this question on stackover flow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17667594/iterating-a-div-over-an-image
[20:44:27] <Eviltwin> ericfilkins_: http://jsfiddle.net/Czmz2/
[20:46:26] <ericfilkins_> I have the coordinates iterating properly i just need a way to append a div over an image using them
[20:46:45] <Beg__f> position absolute?
[20:47:06] <ericfilkins_> ya
[20:47:51] <ericfilkins_> heres the fiddle with all the jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/filkinsteez/vATcn/29/
[20:50:08] <ericfilkins_> Eviltwin do I have to use .data(); instead?
[20:50:52] <ericfilkins_> I'm getting an error that says pos_width is undefined
[20:51:10] <ericfilkins_> it is defined in the addTag function
[20:51:18] <ericfilkins_> should I make that a global variable?
[21:00:40] <ericfilkins_> nvm just had to put the variable in the iterating function itself
[21:48:50] <r0bgleeson> can you say $("input[type=radio,name=foo]") ?
[21:49:37] <systemfault> Nope, not like that
[21:49:53] <systemfault> You'd need $("input[type=radio][name=foo]")
[21:50:17] <r0bgleeson> thanks :)
[22:50:56] <rabbi1> hi, how can get all the details, roomno and bookingdates by comparing with 5 dates  ? http://jsfiddle.net/5b7x9/
[22:54:09] <chovy> rabbi1: what do you mean comparing with 5 dates?
[22:55:11] <rabbi1> i want to get the details like roomno, and the booking dates object.  all dates are dates the room is booked.
[22:56:02] <rabbi1> chovy: so if user sends a date, to find out wether that room s booked for that day.
[22:56:56] <chovy> can you loop through the booked dates and compare each date to the one the user supplies?
[22:57:02] <chovy> if there's a match...then its booked.
[22:57:37] <rabbi1> yeah, i have done but, gettin it wrong somewhere.
[22:58:08] <rabbi1> more than the status i need the entire data of that date
[22:58:35] <chovy> what do you mean data of the date?
[22:59:09] <rabbi1> here, the roomno, sd, ed, alldates, and nod...
[23:00:58] <rabbi1> also, need compare that for 5 different dates… so the result could be rooomno 'a' s booked for 5/4/3/2/1 day of the given dates
[23:03:12] <rabbi1> chovy: i tried $.grep as well couldn't get the logical result...
[23:06:06] <chovy> i don't know.
[23:06:13] <chovy> i don't fully understand what you need to do.
[23:08:49] <rabbi1> chovy: this is what i have tried until now.. http://jsfiddle.net/5b7x9/1/
[23:10:48] <rabbi1> chovy: i have set of rooms, which is booked for certain dates…. a user would want to check the availability of the room for particular date or for particular dates… so if user sends say 'jan 1 2013 to jan 5 2013' he should get the result of which room is booked for which all dates, and available for which all dates with in that date range….
[23:12:25] <chovy> you can just access the data with obj.alldates
[23:12:40] <chovy> nm
[23:15:04] <rabbi1> chovy: it should be like for jan 1 2013, room 1 is booked, room 2 is booked, room 3 is available and room 4 is booked…. the result should be http://jsfiddle.net/5b7x9/2/
[23:15:44] <nesoi> hey so I'm doing some jquery mobile, and I am not getting everything to fit in one screen with no scrolling. How do I do that? For instance, how do I define that a listview should be only x% of the available screen height?
[23:15:48] <nesoi> I have an example here http://pastebin.com/aEAX48t3
[23:16:11] <rabbi1> chovy: something like resultdata in the fiddle
[23:19:11] <chovy> rabbi1: sorry. i can't help you.
[23:19:54] <rabbi1> chovy: that ok :(
[23:24:49] <lamerion> hello, i have a jquery MOBILE slider which has range from 1 - 5000000, the step increments when sliding is about 20000, how can i change the maths of this cause it needs to be smaller than that..
[23:25:21] <lamerion> i tried the step attribute but it doesn't seem to work as intended and only changes the end result if i manually key in the amount hmm
[23:27:42] <Cork> lamerion: step
[23:28:19] <Cork> ah...
[23:28:26] <Cork> the mobile version doesn't have that...
[23:28:59] <Cork> oh, yes it does
[23:29:06] <nesoi> while we're talking about JQM, how do I change the vertical size of a listview to a % of screen area?
[23:29:08] <Cork> lamerion: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/slider/index.html
[23:29:49] <nesoi> anyone know?
[23:33:40] <lamerion> Cork: seems like jquery mobile attempts to optimize the slider at extreme ammounts, try putting in a max of 5 million and the step size will be 30k regardless how much i put into the step attributes, was wondering if anyone has luck overriding this default behaviour or at least create segmented sliders... hmm
[23:34:33] <Cork> lamerion: might be that the ui step size can't be smaller then that cross systems
[23:35:52] <nesoi> nevermind, I figured out how to make it work....
[23:36:10] <Cork> lamerion: max number of steps might be around 170 steps
[23:36:11] <nesoi> ie: put everything in fixed header and footer, and then have whatever you want to scroll in the middle
[23:36:40] <nesoi> seems dodgy, but apparently it works
[23:37:09] <Cork> nesoi: some devices can't have more then one scrollable area (the document)
[23:37:18] <Cork> so ya, fixed is normally how it is solved
[23:37:36] <Cork> nesoi: though i know very little about how jqm works
[23:37:53] <Cork> but rendering on mobiles is quite limited in what you can do
[23:38:01] <nesoi> cork: like what I did?: fixed header with whatever data, listview put in the content div, fixed footer with textarea and buttons, etc.
[23:38:34] <nesoi> if that solves it, it's pretty easy
[23:38:37] <Cork> nesoi: not sure what listview is, but yes, a fixed bar at the top and one at the bottom, and the normal page flow for the scroll
[23:38:51] <nesoi> I just saw all kinds of discussion about how difficut it was
[23:38:59] <Cork> well it is
[23:39:01] <nesoi> I hope this actually works
[23:39:05] <Cork> but there isn't much other options
[23:39:08] <nesoi> not if what I just did actually works
[23:39:16] <nesoi> in that case it's dead simple
[23:39:20] <Cork> the problem is some mobile browsers has VERY hard time with fixed elements
[23:39:22] <nesoi> (fingers crossed)
[23:39:25] <nesoi> ah
[23:39:31] <nesoi> like what mobile browsers??
[23:39:55] <nesoi> isn't jquery supposed to isolate you from browser issues???!?
[23:40:05] <Cork> iphone, older android (pre android 4.1), older firefox
[23:40:28] <Cork> iphone gets serious probles with bottom bars when you activate edit mode
[23:40:35] <Cork> but jqm has code to hide the bar when that happens
[23:41:49] <Cork> for firefox i think it was fixed in like 15 or something like that
[23:41:52] <nesoi> dang, lots of older androids out there
[23:41:53] <Cork> but not sure there
[23:41:58] <nesoi> I don't care about FF cuz this is an app
[23:42:05] <Cork> nesoi: most of the market is 2.3
[23:42:06] <nesoi> what happens in older android?
[23:42:08] <nesoi> right
[23:42:23] <Cork> click through, it jumps around when you scroll and things like that
[23:42:45] <nesoi> click through?
[23:42:54] <Cork> by jumps around i mean, the position is updated when the scroll ends
[23:43:04] <Cork> so the bar follows with the page scroll, and then jumps back
[23:43:17] <nesoi> that's sucky
[23:43:24] <Cork> nesoi: ya, some elements if they are under the bar will take the click action even if you click the bar
[23:43:32] <lamerion> Cork: i double checked with the normal html range and it seems to have more fine grained control than the jqm one.
[23:43:47] <nesoi> cork I have that problem with android 4.1.1 with popups
[23:43:50] <Cork> nesoi: mobile browsers are VERY sucky, as soon as you try to do something that isn't animations and gradients
[23:43:54] <lamerion> well just to be clear what i was referring to.. http://jsfiddle.net/LSGAk/3/
[23:43:58] <nesoi> I solved it for most cases, but it will still select a textview
[23:44:22] <Cork> nesoi: ya, most of it can be solved, but it's just that; you need to make js hacks around the problem
[23:44:58] <nesoi> I am deciding more and more that this jqm version of my app is just the demo
[23:45:05] <nesoi> and that it will have to be rewritten in java
[23:45:07] <nesoi> :(
[23:46:12] <Cork> nesoi: well if only apple could fix there damn browser, and android would replace the sucky built in browser with chrome or something
[23:46:19] <Cork> it wouldn't be bad actually
[23:46:38] <Cork> but sadly none of the parties care about fixing there crap sadly
[23:46:58] <Cork> lamerion: ya, that looks like a maximum number of steps thing
[23:47:00] <nesoi> right, and there are lots of older ones out there
[23:59:22] <nesoi> why is it that in the jquery mobile sites I've looked at no one says to make the pages like this?
