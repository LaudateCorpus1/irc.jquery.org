[00:00:33] <jfugett> That really depends on what your overall goal is with the function. Your issue is with the scope. Personally I'd not create it on window and have the function return the array at least as a starting point
[00:00:53] <jfugett> then have the calling code operate on the returned array as necessary
[00:01:41] <Bauer1> jfugett: but how? it can only return one element at a time, due to it being inside .each..
[00:04:10] <jfugett> updated fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/wUqFT/2/
[00:04:51] <jfugett> essentially the .each still has access to the variables defined outside of it so after the .each is finished return the finalized array
[00:05:50] <Bauer1> hmmm, werid, because I tried that before, and the function inside .each didnt see the external Platforms array
[00:06:59] <Bauer1> thanks jfugett!! now I will work on processing the output into the correct data structure :)
[00:07:08] <jfugett> it should work as long as you don't redefine it inside the .each then the local scope overrides the outer scope
[00:07:13] <jfugett> no worries at all
[00:30:24] <FilipNortic> IS there a good page with jQuery best pracrices or is general for javascript?
[00:31:30] <ravenzz> FilipNortic there are plenty. eloquentjavascript.com jqfundamentals.com jslint.com
[00:31:51] <ravenzz> http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[00:39:01] <FilipNortic> ravnenzz: thanks jQfundamentals was propably what I was looking for.
[00:40:00] <FilipNortic> Do poeple reaaly use jsLint for code quality I more or less thought of it as a syntaxs valid checker...
[00:55:50] <Bauer1> jfugett: I got the first group working, but the jquery .change method does not seem to trigger when a checkbox is modified, line 57 on: http://jsfiddle.net/wUqFT/3/
[00:57:52] <Bauer1> same for .click - it doesnt work for a group of selected checkboxes, why?
[01:02:00] <jfugett> Bauer1: Taking a look
[01:04:30] <fella5s> Bauer1, pass function to that .click without ()'s
[01:05:55] <fella5s> ---change, to that change
[01:06:28] <Bauer1> thanks fella5s! interesting.. such a small thing fucked it up :)
[01:06:57] <Bauer1> this is why I dislike working with javascript.. its a very messy hard to follow or debug
[01:10:06] <Bauer1> how could I have known that? even documentation is misleading, saying $('.target').change(function()
[01:11:33] <jfugett> Bauer1: The difference is the way javascript treats functions. They're first class citizens just like a string so you can pass them around without the parenthesis. If you added parentheses after the example in the documentation it would execute it right away just like what was happening in the callback you had setup
[01:12:13] <jfugett> It takes a little different way of thinking about it but javascript really has some great power in it if you can get around the differences between it and more traditional programming languages
[01:15:10] <Bauer1> ahhh, now that makes sense :) well, question is, long is the learning/adaptation curve to really get comfortable with JS? it would be great if some day, I would feel more at ease with it the way I feel with other programming languages
[01:19:42] <jfugett> That really just depends on the person unfortunately. I can't vouch for anybody else's experience but we started using nodejs at work and it's improved everybodies javascript a great deal takes the browser aspect out of it and lets you focus on the language
[01:20:35] <Bauer1> really? one of the things I hate about JS is how you have to account for like 5 major browsers which is a big pain taking out the fun
[01:22:08] <jfugett> might be worth a shot it worked for some of the guys on the team, we've been lucky though we only support chrome and firefox for our app so we don't have to deal with all the ie mayhem
[01:23:46] <Bauer1> here they wouldnt accept work which  doesnt run on IE :) but lucky me, I am usually as far as possible from client side stuff, but still I need to improve my JS skills somehow...
[01:23:53] <Bauer1> for future jobs :)
[01:24:03] <JosephFerano> is there a way to detect if I dragged something onto something else, like being able to detect if I did mouseup over an element? If I do mousedown over another element and then mouseup over the one in question, it doesn't register it (understandably)
[01:24:36] <fella5s> I was hired as "java developer" and for first 4 months my job description was almost purely js
[01:26:03] <Bauer1> fella5s: and you didnt get frustrated with JS debuggin?
[01:27:00] <colock> hello, i'm trying to implement this behavior with jQuery Mobile 1.3.1: I have a group of checkboxes, and I want to prevent the user to uncheck the last checked one. For this i'm binding a callback on the 'change' (also tried with 'click') event on each checkbox of the group, i check the size of the :checked selector array and if it's zero, i use .preventDefault() on the event. The problem is that it seems the
[01:27:03] <colock> checkbox is still checked during the callback, and gets unchecked after the callback returns.
[01:27:33] <JosephFerano> I guess one way of doing it is to have a bool called "isHovering", have mouseenter set it to true, mouseleave set it to false, and then have this element subscribe to a $(document).mouseup event, and if it's hovering, call true
[01:27:34] <seutje> so check for 2 :D
[01:27:37] <colock> anyone has an idea of what i'm doing wrong?
[01:28:00] <seutje> colock: it's kinda logical that the handler fires before the state is updated, how else could u prevent it?
[01:28:19] <colock> well, it does not prevent it right now. so i'm stuck.
[01:28:31] <seutje> oh
[01:29:02] <JosephFerano> I found this;
[01:29:03] <JosephFerano> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309912/jquery-detect-mousedown-inside-an-element-and-then-mouseup-outside-the-element
[01:29:13] <JosephFerano> if nobody has any better suggestions I'll go for that
[01:29:55] <colock> seutje: i try to write a small(est) working example to show the thing.
[01:31:11] <JosephFerano> ok, I guess I"m going to try that solution then
[01:31:56] <seutje> colock: hmm right, forgot about the while change/click/keyup thing
[01:32:13] <seutje> colock: basically, change fires after, click/keyup fire before
[01:32:46] <colock> i tried with both change and click
[01:32:52] <colock> should i use keyup ?
[01:34:34] <seutje> colock: http://jsfiddle.net/nqGM2/
[01:34:43] <seutje> keyup is just to catch keyboard-only users
[01:35:01] <seutje> checkboxes are the type where power-users also use a11y controls
[01:35:16] <colock> okay
[01:35:30] * colock should read about delegateTarget()
[01:36:02] <colock> thanks
[01:36:04] <Coltaine> I have trouble with a timeout function for  a ajax call: when in  a select field no key is pressed for more that 500 ms  a ajaxfunction should be fired. but instead if fires everytime  a key is pressed. http://jsfiddle.net/wzjFx/
[01:37:50] <JosephFerano> what do you guys think of this? is this efficient?
[01:37:51] <JosephFerano> http://hastebin.com/jewugedive.js
[01:38:25] <JosephFerano> I'm going to have anywhere from 5-15 of those scripts running on the page, I figured it might be more efficient to bind and unbind instead of having all of them listening to $(document).mouseup
[01:38:35] <JosephFerano> oops, did something wrong
[01:38:46] <seutje> colock: I used delegateTarget to avoid having to go back up the chain from e.target (or "this")
[01:38:53] <seutje> colock: do note it's jQuery specific
[01:38:55] <colock> okay
[01:38:55] <JosephFerano> ok, fixed it;
[01:38:57] <JosephFerano> http://hastebin.com/pekaduduwu.js
[01:39:03] <seutje> (it's the element u called the .on() on)
[01:39:46] <colock> seutje: I was doing with $('input:checkbox[name=foo]').each(function (i,elem) { $(elem).bind('change', function (event) { ....
[01:39:58] <colock> binding the function on each input
[01:40:06] <colock> is that so different?
[01:41:17] <JosephFerano> I guess the question is, what is more js intensive, binding and unbinding a button, or having 10-15 buttons actively listening for mouseup events?
[01:44:17] <tuv> is there a canonical (or best-known) debounce plugin? seems to be there are a few. not sure which to use. any suggestions?
[01:44:55] <tuv> (for limiting input/keyup events that trigger ajax actions)
[01:44:59] <seutje> colock: that's kinda unnecessary, cause u don't need to keep reference to a variable on a per-field basis (aside from when it's actually triggered)
[01:45:18] <seutje> colock: most of jQuery's methods have an implied internal .each wrapper
[01:45:35] <seutje> xcept getters like .css('display')
[01:45:41] <Iszak> What is everyones opinion on binding global events on document?
[01:45:44] <seutje> they just return the value for the first item in the set
[01:46:03] <seutje> Iszak: I prefer body
[01:46:17] <seutje> well, sorta depends on the document
[01:46:31] <seutje> sometimes it becomes really interesting to narrow down the scope of the actual handler
[01:46:35] <Iszak> seutje:  any reason why? It just feels wrong (after coming from backbone)
[01:46:45] <seutje> sometimes it's more beneficial to widen the scope
[01:47:03] <seutje> Iszak: well if u do ur own delegation, u can have it all in 1 handler
[01:47:03] <colock> seutje: still not working on jquery Mobile's checkboxes
[01:47:10] * colock debugging
[01:47:14] <Iszak> seutje:  not sure what you mean by that
[01:47:17] <seutje> colock: oh... those are fakeys, no?
[01:47:28] <colock> i'm a beginner in there, no idea :\
[01:47:36] <seutje> Iszak: well if u have like 7 types of buttons in different scopes
[01:48:02] <seutje> u could use $(document).on() 7 times and pass selectors for those 7 types (or rather, their scope)
[01:48:20] <seutje> or u could use 1 $(document).on(), not pass a selector and do the checking urself
[01:48:25] <Coltaine> no one who knows what is wrong with my code?
[01:49:07] <Iszak> I guess, I just feel like $(document).bind() is bad practice if that's all you do, it may as well be a singleton.
[01:49:12] <Iszak> well technically it is.
[01:49:36] <seutje> colock: never really used jQuery mobile myself, does it create fake analogs for the checkboxes in order to style them or something? cause then it will probably only propagate the change event, which is too late, I think
[01:49:52] <lucasbonomi> Hello, is there a good technic, or a good way to displace the scrollbar 10px on the left, from the original position ?
[01:49:55] <seutje> Iszak: yeah, and that has advantages and disadvantages
[01:50:01] <colock> meh… annoying, /me should find a way
[01:50:18] <seutje> Iszak: usually, I don't bind so globally, only when I start running into perf issues or something
[01:50:53] <colock> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/api/events.html i don't fully understand the subtleties of it seutje, i'll try to find some examples (I failed so far)
[01:52:14] <seutje> Iszak: for instance, if I have a table that's always there and I'm targetting (possibly dynamic) checkboxes in said table, I'd $('.the-table').on('change', 'input', fn);
[01:52:27] <Iszak> I'm talking custom event types
[01:53:44] <seutje> Iszak: ooooh
[01:54:07] <seutje> well u should probably have an object emitting the events instead of using the document
[01:54:21] <seutje> if they're not DOM-related, keep it out of the DOM :P
[01:54:39] <lucasbonomi`> Hello, is there a good technic, or a good way to
[01:54:39] <lucasbonomi`>                     displace the scrollbar 10px on the left, from the
[01:54:40] <seutje> if ur using backbone, u already have ur state object ur listening to, no?
[01:54:45] <Iszak> seutje: yeah, good point. Know of a l/w event library? I'm thinking of using node-window.location.convertPathToArray and their event emitter
[01:54:48] <Iszak> what the fuck
[01:54:50] <Iszak> node-brosify
[01:54:56] <Iszak> node-browsify
[01:55:08] <seutje> lol autocomplete?
[01:55:14] <Iszak> something like that.
[01:55:44] <Iszak> seutje: I just feel uneasy rely on jQuery/Zepto for events, not tied to the DOM.
[01:56:14] <seutje> funny, I had a problem just the other week related to jQuery doing custom events internally
[01:56:52] <seutje> was using the require included jQuery in BB to emit events for 3rd party scripts, but they weren't catching the events, cause they were using a different (global) jQuery
[01:57:15] <Iszak> seutje: ah I'll try and remember that.
[01:57:33] <seutje> ended up giving in and using the same global jQuery in my BB
[01:58:35] <Iszak> seutje:  old version of jQuery?
[01:58:47] <seutje> saw a lightweight event library passing by the other week on the githubs, lemme try find it
[01:59:03] <seutje> Iszak: yeah, like 1.8.something
[01:59:05] <Iszak> seutje: it's okay, I think I might just recommend Backbone
[01:59:27] <Iszak> we use backbone already, this is just for l/w projects, but we can just use certain backbone elements e.g. router/events
[02:05:15] <seutje> Iszak: well, then you probably have to expose it globally, no?
[02:06:51] <seutje> heh
[02:06:55] <seutje> should probably update limechat
[02:07:08] <Iszak> seutje:  what do you mean?
[02:07:32] <seutje> Iszak: well, how is the non BB script gonna access the state object for instance
[02:07:56] <Iszak> seutje:  noo I'm just saying, I'm not going to use non-BB and BB, just commit to one.
[02:08:00] <seutje> also, if u wanna go crazy with monitoring state, https://github.com/fynyky/reactor.js might be interesting :D
[02:08:05] <seutje> Iszak: oh, ok
[02:10:06] <seutje> there we go, should crash a lil less now :D
[02:14:01] <miCSu> http://jsfiddle.net/PKcV9/ how should this be done to add the list element to the other list inside the div that's being created?
[02:15:10] <lucasbonomi`>        hi
[02:15:25] <Cork> miCSu: add what list?
[02:15:31] <lucasbonomi`> Anybody got a solution to put the scrollbars outside the scrolledbox ?
[02:15:44] <Cork> miCSu: also, live is removed so don't use it
[02:16:01] <miCSu> yeah, but it's working with 172
[02:16:15] <Cork> miCSu: yes but use .delegate instead
[02:16:17] <Cork> ?.delegate
[02:16:18] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:16:54] <miCSu> ok, but anyway I'd like to add the clicked li element to the list that's inside divEl
[02:17:02] <Cork> lucasbonomi: you would either have to add a wrapper element and fake things, or replace the scrollbar with a scrollbar emulation in javascript
[02:17:34] <lucasbonomi`> Thanks, any of you got a good link to learn how to emulate them in js ?
[02:17:45] <Cork> ok, so you want to take the clicked li, and add an ul after the current ul element, and put the li in it?
[02:17:59] <Cork> lucasbonomi: there is a lot of libs for it; google
[02:18:23] <Cork> lucasbonomi: though that said, you should be careful, cause it is not the best thing to do for compatibility
[02:18:41] <miCSu> as you can see there also is an ul element inside divEl and I'd like to add the clicked li inside it
[02:19:01] <Cork> miCSu: yes, but i'm just verifying where you want to add divEl
[02:19:18] <miCSu> after the original ul
[02:19:40] <khaan> hi everybody. I'm trying to use jquery waypoints. I want to have an object appearing at a certain offset from the bottom of the screen, fading in. Can someone help me please? did anyone ever tried this? :)
[02:21:26] <Cork> miCSu: http://jsfiddle.net/PKcV9/1/
[02:24:49] <miCSu> ah, so the problem was not creating an element from the variable
[02:25:00] <Cork> no you created many elements
[02:25:09] <Cork> one each time you did $(divEl)
[02:32:04] <miCSu> yeah
[02:32:15] <miCSu> thanks
[02:44:24] <colock> seutje: still here? i've made a small jquery mobile example for my problem, if you have time and are willing to, can you give a look? http://jsfiddle.net/nqGM2/7/
[02:44:58] <seutje> sure, but this meeting is running at its end :P
[02:47:21] <colock> seutje: lol :P
[02:51:32] <seutje> colock: this seems to work, but seems a bit dodgy
[02:51:38] <devians> hey, i'm using the standard trick to get some html as a string, ie $('<div>').append($object.clone()).html(); In chrome this pulls out cleanly, but in firefox I get reordered attributes. Since im hashing the output, order matters. How can I ensure that firefox will return this string as it exists in the source?
[02:52:02] <devians> (I'm working with an uploaded xml file)
[02:53:08] <seutje> devians: ur cloning an object, there is no more link to the source
[02:53:16] <seutje> if u want the source as a string, use it as such
[02:53:28] <seutje> once u convert, the browser decides what to make of it
[02:53:31] <devians> not sure I follow. how can I get the html string of an object?
[02:53:48] <colock> seutje: it works?
[02:53:50] <devians> ah. you're advocating i parse my xml with regex and the like?
[02:53:51] <seutje> spec doesn't enforce an order in the attributes, so browsers do whatever
[02:54:00] <colock> i can still unselect the last one seutje…
[02:54:34] <seutje> colock: bummer, worked on my chromesies :(
[02:54:43] <colock> meh, firefox here
[02:54:50] <colock> let's see with chrome
[02:54:55] <seutje> devians: erm, ok... if that's how u interpreted that, I'ma just back off and wish u the best of luck
[02:55:21] <colock> (this sucks :S)
[02:55:28] <devians> well, jquery handles xml documents fine, and seems like the correct tool.
[02:55:38] <seutje> imagine the meeting I'm in
[02:55:43] <colock> mwhuahuha
[02:55:49] <devians> but if it allows the browser to mangle the source then either it or i am doing something wrong, and its probably the latter
[02:57:41] <seutje> well, why are you relying on the order of the attributes?
[02:58:02] * colock can still unselect last checkbox with chromium
[02:58:10] <colock> so, no, does not work :(
[02:59:00] <devians> seutje, because i'm hashing the string output
[02:59:02] <seutje> colock: hmz, probably helps if I paste the correct link http://jsfiddle.net/nqGM2/8/
[02:59:07] <colock> righto :P
[02:59:28] <colock> oh, reclicking :P
[02:59:45] <seutje> eyah, hence the "dodgy" note
[03:00:01] <colock> thanks :)
[03:00:16] <colock> yeah, "make it work" >> "make it beautiful"
[03:00:39] <seutje> devians: so u just wanna compare 2 XML blobs?
[03:00:53] <seutje> that are parsed and re-serialized
[03:01:09] <devians> no, i have a large xml document, and i'm pulling a subset node of that document and sha256'ing it and comparing it against another source.
[03:01:20] <titii> hi, i am using autocomplete of jquery, and i am using custom render with method _renderItem, i dont know how, can i css style on the hover of the items, because now there is no hover style. How can I do it? I cant find any solution on the google
[03:01:56] <Cork> titii: add a class to the element you add in the _renderItem function
[03:01:59] <titii> i mean when moving on with arrows
[03:02:26] <Cork> titii: and make sure you add the expected elements in the function
[03:02:33] <tuv> i have a function that calls a $.post. when i call it as an event handler e.g. on('<event>', myf) - it works find. if i call it directly, e.g. myf(); - i get a 403 error in the javascript console!
[03:02:35] <Cork> else the autocomplete will break
[03:03:01] <Cork> tuv: are you using this.href or similar for the url?
[03:03:07] <titii> Cork: ok, on mouse hover it works, but not with arrow of keywords - down or up
[03:03:10] <tuv> no. hardcoded
[03:03:36] <Cork> titii: like i said, make sure you add the expected elements in the function
[03:03:44] <Cork> titii: autocomplete is a bit picky about that
[03:03:51] <tuv> Cork: the post url uses '/this/form/'
[03:04:00] <titii> cork what u mean by expected elements?
[03:04:12] <Cork> tuv: that doens't really make sense
[03:04:21] <Cork> titii: you have to create ul, li and an a link
[03:05:17] <titii> cork: yes, but how to make an event for keys of arrows up and down, dont understand that
[03:05:25] <tuv> Cork: $.post('/path/of/post/handler/relative/to/server/root',...) - absolute path with no hostname
[03:05:31] <Cork> titii: it will if yoiu have the correct elements
[03:05:35] <Cork> titii: return $("<li>").append("<a>" + item.label + "<br>" + item.desc + "</a>").appendTo(ul) <--
[03:05:55] <tuv> Cork: and it works when triggered by the event
[03:05:57] <Cork> tuv: ok, and why does the server return 404?
[03:06:44] <tuv> Cork: 403, not 404. forbidden. no idea why, especially that it doesn't do so when triggered by an event. only on load
[03:07:04] <Cork> tuv: sounds like the server expects some data it doesn't get
[03:07:54] <tuv> how do i call a function on load? i'm just calling it on its own now: myf();
[03:08:20] <tuv> should i use ready() or some such
[03:08:48] <seutje> devians: googling around a bit, it seems like you'll have to make ur own serialize function and implement some logic for forcing them in alphabetical order order or w/e
[03:09:17] <devians> yeah, im getting the same feeling. hrm
[03:09:22] <Cork> tuv: the function isn't the problem
[03:09:33] <seutje> even found commercial compare-XML applications that screw up on attribute order
[03:09:38] <Cork> tuv: you grab a content from somewhere and the data is missing
[03:10:58] <tuv> Cork: $(document).ready(myf); works fine!
[03:11:15] <Cork> tuv: so you run $('') or similar in the function
[03:11:52] <tuv> Cork: yes. the function looks up content in the page
[03:12:12] <titii> Cork: but its not correct for me, i would make it with some div, like: return $("<li class='table'>").append('<div class="table-cell"><a>... can i make it with it?
[03:12:43] <seutje> devians: a possible (dirty) workaround would be to abuse extra elements as pretend-attributes
[03:12:56] <devians> seutje could you elaborate?
[03:13:04] <Cork> titii: return $("<li>").append("<div class="table-cell"><a>" + item.label + "<br>" + item.desc + "</a></div>").appendTo(ul) <--
[03:13:34] <seutje> like instead of <foo bar="meh"></foo>, <foo><attr bar="meh"></foo>
[03:13:54] <seutje> I know it's dirty, but prolly beats writing a serializer
[03:15:24] <titii> Cork: yes, but now, when the div is here, the hover effect when i pressing up or down kay doesnt appear, i would like to make it somehow
[03:15:25] <tuv> Cork: console.log($('..')); myf(); -> i see the correct content in the console log. the same lookup is inside myf(). i still get a 403 in this case
[03:15:51] <Cork> titii: it might be the extra div that breaks things
[03:16:05] <Cork> titii: it most likely have to be the outer most element
[03:16:29] <Cork> tuv: so, again you need to check why
[03:16:36] <titii> Cork: yes, but can i make that fx by my self?
[03:16:47] <Cork> 403 doens't say what is invalid, just that the user does an invalid action
[03:17:03] <Cork> titii: you would have to reimplement most of ti
[03:17:05] <Cork> *it
[03:17:16] <Cork> titii: but why do you have to have the div outside the link?
[03:18:00] <titii> Cork: because of my styles, but maybe i can do it without it, right, i am gona try it
[03:18:25] <Cork> titii: you can make a link into a block element with display: block;
[03:18:28] <titii> Cork: but, ok, when i do it, i dont know how can i restyle that hover effect by my self
[03:18:32] <Cork> so there really is no need for the div
[03:20:18] <tuv> Cork: well, $(document).ready(myf) works, but 'myf();' doesn't. i'm just curious why
[03:20:30] <Cork> cause you do dom search
[03:20:40] <Cork> so you need to wait for the dom to be loaded == ready
[03:21:04] <tuv> console.log(<same search>) works fine in the same spot
[03:21:23] <tuv> or does the console wait for the dom anyway?
[03:21:24] <Cork> console.log($('search').length)
[03:21:34] <Cork> the console runs when you run it
[03:21:54] <titii> Cork: ok it works, but how canm i restyle this default hover?
[03:22:31] <Cork> titii: .ui-state-focus
[03:23:42] <tuv> Cork: console.log($('#mytextarea').val())
[03:24:13] <Cork> so does console.log($('#mytextarea').length) return 1 in both cases?
[03:24:14] <tuv> prints the textarea contents in the console
[03:24:27] <Cork> if you put them in the function
[03:24:56] <tuv> haven't tried in the function. it works right before the function call
[03:26:04] <walalang> hi.. using filter and -ms-filter to have a max width background on ie8.. i dont  know what to do to change the background on ie8.
[03:26:36] <Cork> css(
[03:26:46] <Cork> css('-ms-filter', '')
[03:27:11] <walalang> i try that sir.. no work for me
[03:27:20] <titii> Cork: thank u my friends, now i just gonna restyle it, but it works. thank u for help ;)
[03:28:17] <xtradigital> Hi, is it possible to have bookmarkable slides in jquery cycle2 carousel? Seems a little buggy..
[03:28:44] <[E]sc> is there a setting that will resize the parent of the tabs function in jqueryui?  i find that one of my tabs expands quite large, leaving the scroll bar of the smaller tabs to scroll empty space.  I'm hoping to resize to the current tab height and avoid that.
[03:30:34] <xtradigital> Hi, is it possible to have bookmarkable slides in jquery cycle2 carousel? Seems a little buggy..
[03:31:47] <walalang> other way to change filter on css with jquiery?
[03:35:45] <seutje> walalang: can you show an example of how you tried to do it, cause that should work
[03:37:45] <walalang> css({ ' filter ' : ' .... '  ,  ' -ms-filter '  :  ' ... '});
[03:38:11] <Cork> you can't have the space in the key name
[03:38:35] <mikecmpbll> lol
[03:38:37] <seutje> I was hoping for an actual example I could see not working
[03:38:59] <seutje> cause now I'm assuming the ' .... ' is not a real value (for example)
[03:39:10] <seutje> these assumptions are gonna cause this to take a while
[03:50:49] <bacilla> I cannot figure out a way to wrap a div around each two selected elements; maybe anyone is willing to do some thinking? :)
[04:01:10] <bacilla> oh wow... so silmple – slice();
[04:01:15] <bacilla> if anyone was wondering
[04:01:29] <bacilla> and wrapAll()
[04:31:47] <Reck> Are there any way I can catch both .active and .notactive in $('.active').click(function() {}); ?
[04:32:12] <sammich> comma
[04:32:22] <sammich> $('selector1, selector2')
[04:33:06] <Reck> thanks!
[04:35:11] <sammich> jQuery uses the same syntax as normal CSS selectors, as well as their own
[04:42:54] <Reck> How can I see what $('.saveFavorite').serialize() contains?
[04:43:06] <sammich> console.log()
[04:43:33] <Reck> Where can I read the output of console.log?
[04:43:42] <sammich> in console ;)
[04:43:48] <sammich> what browser are you using?
[04:45:02] <Reck> I'm pretty new to frontend development :-D I was too quick on the trigger, I actually found it on my own :-D
[04:46:36] <Reck> I have a $('.saveFavorite') form with a button for each article on my page. Using $('.saveFavorite').serialize(), it takes all of those forms together, how do I get the clicked one only?
[04:46:46] <the_dark_knight> hi
[04:47:37] <sammich> $('.saveFavourite').on('click', function() { console.log($(this)); });
[04:48:05] <seutje> use submit event for form
[04:48:18] <seutje> there's a bunch of ways to submit a form without triggering a click on it
[04:48:26] <sammich> yeah, that one
[04:50:53] <Reck> how is that done?
[04:51:15] <sammich> $('.saveFavourite').on('submit', function() { console.log($(this)); });
[04:54:37] <Reck> Thank you
[04:55:10] <bourne_at_night> Hi
[04:55:54] <Reck> I have many .saveFavourite forms. How can I get the .serialize() values form the one clicked? $('.gemFavorit').submit(function() {});
[04:56:05] <Reck> $('.saveFavourite').submit(function() {});*
[04:56:25] <sammich> $('.saveFavourite').on('submit', function() { console.log($(this).serialize()); }); I think
[04:56:52] <bourne_at_night> I am creating form builder using Jquery and bootstrap, I am able to drag the <div> but in firebug it gives error as "TypeError: $(...).droppable is not a function"
[04:57:18] <sammich> do you have jQuery UI loaded?
[04:57:20] <Reck> sammich: Thank you once again!
[04:57:27] <bourne_at_night> this is my Jquery code :
[04:57:41] <bourne_at_night> $(function() {
[04:57:41] <bourne_at_night>     $( ".card" ).draggable({helper:'clone'});
[04:57:41] <bourne_at_night>     $( "#droppable" ).droppable({
[04:57:41] <bourne_at_night>     	accept: ".card",
[04:57:41] <bourne_at_night>     
[04:57:44] <bourne_at_night>       drop: function( event, ui ) {
[04:57:46] <bourne_at_night>     	  console.log("Item was Dropped");
[04:57:49] <bourne_at_night> 			$(this).append($(ui.draggable).clone());
[04:57:51] <bourne_at_night>       }
[04:57:54] <bourne_at_night>     });
[04:57:56] <bourne_at_night>   });
[04:57:59] <bourne_at_night> please help me
[04:58:10] <sammich> okay, rule #1
[04:58:16] <sammich> don't paste chunks of code here
[04:58:26] <bourne_at_night> sorry
[04:58:38] <Reck> www.pastebin.com
[04:58:50] <gry> no. pastee.org or anything else without ads.
[04:58:51] <sammich> just see if you have jquery UI loaded via a script tag
[04:59:11] <gry> "Paste code @ http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com" @ /topic
[04:59:11] <bourne_at_night> okay
[04:59:26] <gry> presumably those are ads-free, too.
[05:01:49] <Akkumulator> hello
[05:04:07] <Akkumulator> inside my jquery plugin I use `$(this).trigger('collection.afterAdd', this);` to trigger an event. however, the event is never fired. Im listening to it using `$('.collection').plugin().on('collection.afterAdd',function(e,item){
[05:04:07] <Akkumulator>         console.log(item);
[05:04:07] <Akkumulator>     });`
[05:05:28] <seutje> Akkumulator: this example makes it rather impossible to determine if $(this) and $('.collection').plugin() compromise the same element
[05:06:21] <seutje> comprise*
[05:07:16] <Akkumulator> seutje they are the same element. options passed to the plugin are processed as exspected. I left them out for readability
[05:07:29] <Frantic1> hey guys, not sure how to ask this, but I'm about to send a link of my work to some people over email, and I'ld like to be able to see their pageviews in realtime. Is there any gogole-analytics-but-realtime product that is popular? Or should I just pick one from google searches? :)
[05:07:58] <sammich> well, goo.gl has analytics
[05:08:32] <Akkumulator> seutje ill paste a pastie
[05:08:56] <seutje> Akkumulator: that's odd... what if u bind it on the body, like $('body').on('collection.afterAdd', function(e){ console.log(e); }); ?
[05:09:23] <Reck> How can I change the class of the submit button on the .gemFavorit form? http://pastebin.com/3Yk7KF7r
[05:09:25] <Frantic1> sammich: they do, but I'd like to track it realtime for about an hour, to see the impact of my email
[05:10:06] <seutje> Akkumulator: if that does nothing, it would suggest the event is being stopPropagated by something else
[05:10:10] <Akkumulator> seutje this is my plugin http://pastie.org/8074830
[05:10:21] <monster> I have this structure. <div class="1"><div class="2"></div></div>. When I hover anywhere in Div class="1" I want the class="2" to change background. However I have several divs with the same class. This is what I've tried so far but failed. $('.1').stop().closest('div').css(...); inside a hover function ofc. But it does not work, it enlights them all.
[05:10:41] <sammich> at first thought, you could have a resource in that email that loads from a server you have access to. Then just check the logs for that file being served
[05:11:46] <sammich> monster: you'll want .children('.2')
[05:12:03] <sammich> a number of ways to do that though
[05:12:08] <seutje> Akkumulator: line 55: is that "this" the one you expect it to be, cause you seem to be using it in 2 different context
[05:12:41] <seutje> Akkumulator: shouldn't that be $(this.element).trigger ?
[05:12:51] <seutje> sry, this.$element.trigger()
[05:14:25] <monster> sammich: sacre blue
[05:14:35] <monster> bleu
[05:14:40] <Akkumulator> seutje ah thanks :) I read somewhere that I have to use $(this) inside a plugin to trigger events...
[05:14:47] <seutje> Akkumulator: I might have it the wrong way around, but the use of "this" in the addCollection method seems off, it's both being used as a reference to the instance of the plugin as as a reference to the element currently foreached
[05:15:26] <seutje> Akkumulator: yeah, but only if "this" references the element, from within prototype methods, it references the instance
[05:16:25] <Akkumulator> seutje working fine now, can I give you a flattr?
[05:17:49] <seutje> Akkumulator: sry, a what?
[05:18:00] <Akkumulator> http://flattr.com/
[05:18:13] <seutje> sounds like a euphemism for farting in somebody's face
[05:18:27] <Akkumulator> ehm :D
[05:18:44] <seutje> oh, what is this? ego-points? o.O
[05:19:22] <Akkumulator> you hava a monthy budget wich is shared betwenn all flattrs you give each month
[05:19:40] <sammich> just paypal me all your monies
[05:20:12] <seutje> Akkumulator: oh lol, s'ok, I'd just spend it on drugs anyway
[05:20:24] <sammich> hardcore ibuprofen
[05:21:12] <Akkumulator> ehm ok whatever :O
[05:21:33] <seutje> btw I changed it to use jQuery.proxy() so the "this" context remains the same, and triggered the event on e.target http://pastebin.com/YMrDCRPx
[05:22:16] <Reck> How can I get a hold of a submit button inside a form I have the name of?
[05:22:22] <seutje> I remember hearing about this flattr thing ages ago, didn't know it was being used
[05:22:39] <seutje> Reck: u have the name attribute of the button?
[05:22:44] <seutje> or of the form?
[05:23:33] <Reck> seutje: http://pastebin.com/3uP0SgMD
[05:24:01] <seutje> Reck: gemFavorit is the form, yes?
[05:24:14] <Reck> seutje: There is a lot of forms with the .gemFavorit class, but using $(this) I can get a hold of the form. The next step is just to change the class of the submit button inside the form
[05:24:29] <seutje> Reck: closest goes up the tree
[05:24:45] <seutje> basically you are telling it to look for a <submit> that wraps the form
[05:24:53] <Reck> Oh..
[05:24:58] <seutje> like <submit><form>...</form></submit>
[05:25:01] <Reck> So that is why I can't get it working :-P
[05:25:10] <seutje> obviously, that's... well silly :P
[05:25:19] <CiE> Hey guys i want to know how i can add to a form a jquery variable to be submitted when submit is clicked on the form?
[05:25:23] <seutje> use "find()" to go down the tree
[05:25:31] <khaan> hi guys. I'm kind of desperate. I am trying for some source to understand how to show divs from invisible to visible with jquery waypoints. Can anyone help me please? :(
[05:25:43] <seutje> and use ':submit' to look for buttons
[05:26:05] <seutje> :submit catches <input type="submit" /> as <button>foo</button> iirc
[05:26:12] <seutje> not sure if it includes image buttons
[05:26:44] <seutje> Reck: also note that return false from a submit handler will block submission
[05:26:57] <seutje> (and stop the events from bubbling up)
[05:27:20] <seutje> if you just want to stop the submission, pass an argument to the function and call preventDefault() on it
[05:27:23] <Reck> seutje: I know the return: false one, I am using Ajax in the actual code :-P
[05:27:27] <seutje> for just bubbling, use stopPropagation
[05:27:34] <Reck> seutje: However, it's working now! Thanks alot!
[05:27:53] <seutje> Reck: just making sure, lotsa ppl default to return false and then spend hours wondering why it's stopping propagation :D
[05:28:08] <Reck> seutje: What does propagation mean?
[05:28:12] <sammich> rookies ;)
[05:28:21] <sammich> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[05:28:36] <sammich> stops bubbling of events up the DOM tree
[05:28:45] <seutje> <div class="foo"><div class="bar"></div></div> <- when I click on .bar, the event bubbles up and is also triggered on .foo
[05:29:06] <seutje> if I put a handler on .bar and call stopPropagation on the event object, it will not trigger on .foo
[05:29:11] <sammich> I totally need emmet in my IRC client
[05:29:20] <seutje> `g emmet irc
[05:29:21] <b-ot> seutje: Hereford-IRC Express, Parking & Transportation, U.Va. → http://www.virginia.edu/parking/uts/routes/hereford.html
[05:29:26] <sammich> hah
[05:29:28] <seutje> sry wat?
[05:29:28] <sammich> cheers
[05:29:37] <sammich> oh, that's not it
[05:29:39] <seutje> yeah man, I need that shit as well! :P
[05:29:55] <seutje> what do u mean? everybody needs virginian parking spaces on IRC
[05:30:08] <sammich> helpful bot is helpful
[05:34:28] <seutje> great, the International Rescue Committee is located on Emmet street... this is gonna be impossible to google without some more context q.q
[05:34:44] <sammich> l2google
[05:34:50] <sammich> ;)
[05:38:16] <seutje> sammich: AHA! it's a plugin for textmate?
[05:38:35] <sammich> wait, you know what emmet is right?
[05:38:40] <sammich> I'm sure you do
[05:38:50] <seutje> no, hence the frantic googling
[05:38:58] <sammich> emmet.io
[05:40:26] <sammich> I hate typing tag pairs
[05:40:34] <seutje> this is just zen-coding?
[05:40:58] <sammich> hmm, apparently
[05:41:03] <sammich> but I only know of emmet
[05:41:27] <xec_> they changed the name, god knows why
[05:41:46] <xec_> at least with "zen coding" you got a hint that it's got something to do with coding :P
[05:42:01] <seutje> funny, googling "emmet" gives me 17 pages of noise
[05:42:14] <seutje> googling "zen coding" has emmet.io as the 5th result
[05:42:40] <seutje> that awkward moment when ur old name is still a better search term? :P
[05:42:44] <systemfault> Some people have stupid idea like that… to rename a wide-known brand/product to something we never heard of.
[05:42:47] <xec_> really? i get top 3 results of "emmet" to the plugin
[05:42:51] <sammich> unfortunately my search history has skewed my results
[05:43:00] <xec_> docs/main site/github
[05:43:05] <sammich> like this one time I clicked on this random google ad
[05:43:11] <sammich> then every ad became that ad
[05:43:16] <sammich> for the next week
[05:43:17] <seutje> I get like emmet county and shit
[05:43:23] <seutje> maybe cause it's localized
[05:43:32] <sammich> targeted
[05:43:39] <seutje> eventhough emmet county is prolly further in distance than the server running emmet.io
[05:44:24] <seutje> also getting a lot of emmet cullen shit... for which I will go ahead and blame my roommate :P
[05:45:17] <sammich> seems pretty clear my google-fu is much more advanced than yours, grasshopper
[05:46:57] <xec_> damn my curiousity, now I too have emmett cullen in my search history :(
[05:47:29] <seutje> I'd say the opposite, since google goes so easy on you, giving the right answer with less effort
[06:21:11] <aro> i am trying to animate a div from behind another div. the parent div has a z-index of 15, and this div has a z index of 13. The aniamted div is positioned absolutely while the parent is relatively. What am i doing wrong?
[06:25:11] <sacho> you forgot to mention what exactly you're animating
[06:34:20] <seutje> aro: z-indexes are calculated relative to their closest relatively positioned element
[06:35:01] <seutje> so the inner one would be like 13 + 15
[06:35:29] <seutje> if u wanna place an element behind it's relative parent, use negative z-index
[06:35:50] <seutje> do note that this might be problematic on oldIE
[06:36:58] <jay_> can someone provide me product filter search like myntra, flipkart?
[06:37:30] <jay_> can someone provide me product filter search like myntra, flipkart?
[06:38:52] <seutje> probably, if only I knew what myntra or flipkart were

[06:51:46] <Joe7> hi
[06:52:45] <Joe7> Using DatePicker the default hover state/class is not getting added at all. Any tips why could that be borked?
[06:58:46] <c4ptnh00k> Joe7: seeing all this information in the jsfiddle that you did not provide ofcourse we can help
[07:13:49] <Joe7> c4ptnh00k: sorry, being quite a newbie in terms of js/fiddle :> will try to extract the relevant info of the page. Basicly am simply NOT getting the hover class added on days in datepicker when hovering over.. 'used to work'
[07:14:50] <jedimind> why use js for a hover class ?
[07:14:54] <jedimind> when you can just :hover with css
[07:17:07] <sammich> jquery UI uses hover classes all over
[07:19:56] <jedimind> that doesnt make it right :)

[07:53:52] <prismgate> hi
[07:54:36] <prismgate> How do I detect changes in <script type="javascript" src="http://external.url.com"></script>
[07:55:32] <prismgate> I mean can I do client side hasing or serverside checking of these url, so that in "no case" someone can hack a site and  attack our cleints.
[07:55:55] <prismgate> requirejs etc. come in to mind
[07:56:55] <Cork> prismgate: if the file is changed on the server the js file will be the least of your problems
[07:57:10] <Cork> so secure the dns name, use https
[07:57:50] <prismgate> Cork: https will only prevent MITM in theory.
[07:58:15] <Cork> prismgate: it protects that the server is the correct server
[07:58:40] <prismgate> Cork: can you explain?
[07:58:42] <Cork> and if your server has gotten hacked and the js file changed; like i said => the js file will be the least of your problems
[07:59:00] <Cork> prismgate:the cert for the domain have to match
[07:59:14] <Cork> if it doesn't it's invalid
[07:59:23] <prismgate> Cork: you're changing the situation. The premise is that our server isn't hacked, but a server supplying us with js.
[08:00:06] <Cork> prismgate: well you shouldn't load javascript from them if you don't trust them to secure there server
[08:01:31] <prismgate> Cork: That leaves you with 0 trustable CDNs. You can't trust anyone. My question is, how do I verify that the external script loaded didn't change.
[08:01:34] <boytoy> Greetings
[08:02:05] <Cork> prismgate: the point is; you can't
[08:02:23] <prismgate> Cork: I don't know how SSL will verify that the external script didn't change. It only verifies that the external script is still hosted on the same external server.
[08:02:33] <Cork> prismgate: if the source is changed on the server; it can change your check so it passes it
[08:02:48] <Cork> prismgate: you can verify that the server is the server it claims to be
[08:03:18] <Cork> only way to know you don't get code into your page you don't expect, is by only loading from trusted sources
[08:03:19] <prismgate> Cork: As said, I mentioend that hashing the js and comparing the checksum with the verified one from the server before executing it would solve it, but that would slow things down. Are there any other ways I don't know of?
[08:03:40] <Cork> prismgate: but nothing prevents the "hacker" from modifying you're hash
[08:04:05] <Cork> unless you proxy it over you're own server and do sha check on the data before you send it to the client
[08:04:16] <prismgate> Cork: But this is as secure as two-factor authentifaction. He has to hack the CDN plus US.
[08:04:26] <Cork> prismgate: you can't
[08:04:37] <Cork> prismgate: when the js is loaded, the code in it is executed
[08:04:43] <prismgate> defer?
[08:04:46] <Cork> that means it can modify the scope you're in
[08:04:51] <boytoy> I'm using ResponsiveSlides.js which pauses when you hover it: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/6bNBL/1/ -- so I'm trying to add a manual Pause button which manipulates this feature using mouseover. It seems to work, however when you hover off the slider and then back on it, the sliding resumes. How do I fix this?
[08:04:55] <Cork> that means you can't trust the code you use to check it
[08:04:56] <boytoy> Is there a way to "force" the mouseover?
[08:05:23] <Cork> prismgate: so the best you can do is use csp, and only allow you're own server specific path to load script
[08:05:28] <Cork> and block everything else
[08:05:31] <Cork> including cdn:s
[08:05:39] <prismgate> Cork: you can use requirejs or something similar to load the js, I believe it's possible and ask for a hint on howto. You say it's impossible.
[08:05:55] <Cork> prismgate: no you cna't
[08:05:57] <Cork> *can't
[08:06:20] <Cork> cause when require loads the script it has to either run eval on it, and then you're insecure by design
[08:06:37] <Cork> or it has to use a <script src=""> tag and then it can't block the execution
[08:07:11] <Cork> basically, yes, you can do loads of complex things; but it will be less secure then trusting the server
[08:07:53] <Cork> you don't want to load data from third party if you have a solution where security is important
[08:08:26] <prismgate> Cork: ok, let's assume you're right. How can you remove the malicious javascript from the client? Is there a prioritization in code-execution?
[08:08:36] <prismgate> It needs to be removed from the DOM
[08:09:01] <Cork> prismgate: if it's loaded your to late
[08:09:09] <Cork> the only safe way to remove it is to reload the page
[08:09:25] <Cork> prismgate: and by insecure data i also mean an image link
[08:09:32] <Cork> not just script tags
[08:10:37] <Cork> prismgate: think of javascript like one big bucket, when you load a resource you poor the resource into the bucket
[08:10:59] <Cork> only way to make sure you don't have something rotten in the bucket is to empty it
[08:11:04] <prismgate> Cork: With CORS you can do Cross-origin resource sharing, which allows you to ask a trusted thirdy party server if the loaded scripts are trustworthy or not. Kind of delayed p2p DOM scanning. I just don't know how you can give your removal script the highest priority and avoid the malicious script to block you from removing it.
[08:11:35] <Cork> prismgate: cors is just a way to extend permissions to do ajax cross domain
[08:11:41] <Cork> it's not a way to make things secure
[08:12:20] <prismgate> It can be used to do that. According to Shannon "Decentralization" makes things more secure.
[08:12:40] <Cork> prismgate: not more secure no
[08:12:47] <Cork> thats csp, not cors
[08:12:55] <prismgate> csp?
[08:13:08] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP
[08:13:18] <Cork> or rather https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy
[08:13:24] <prismgate> ah you mean that
[08:13:28] <BillCriswell> CSP is a new one to me.
[08:13:45] <BillCriswell> seems exciting!!!!!
[08:13:51] <Cork> cors is just a way to losen the restrictions
[08:13:53] <BillCriswell> Just kidding.
[08:14:02] <Cork> well it is kinda neat
[08:14:13] <Cork> but it won't make it any more secure if the source is hacked
[08:15:47] <prismgate> Cork: ok, you say the only thing you can do is to remove the external script from trusted sources by enforcing CSP after a client frefresh
[08:19:04] <boytoy> Allow me to rephrase: I'm using ResponsiveSlides which pauses and resumes on hover: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/6bNBL/1/
[08:19:07] <boytoy> But how to add a manual "Pause" button using mouseover? It works initially, but as soon as you hover on and off the slider, ResponsiveSlides' built-in pause and resume overrides my mouseover and my "Pause" button stops working. Is there a way to fix this?
[08:20:35] <CiE> can someone lend a hand with dynamic form and submit to database?
[08:21:11] <prismgate> boytoy: add a stopOnHover parameter to the ResponsiveSlides and do a check if it's enabled. Don't run the buil-in pause/resume code and run your mousover code instead.
[08:21:35] <prismgate> CiE: please elaborate.
[08:22:31] <boytoy> prismgate: As far as I know the only parameter is "pause" :/
[08:23:06] <CiE> prismgate: i have a few fields i'm using jquery.clone to clone them then append them to the form. I am also appending their names with a number that gets generated from a counter i created everytime you hit add. Now i want to be able to pass that to my controller and add to the database. i'm kinda stuck there...
[08:23:07] <prismgate> Cork: OK, I think I found a way. What about a WebApplication that doesn't use src="" to load ressources through the url and verify hashes similar to this: $(window).on('hashchange', function() {....});
[08:23:42] <prismgate> boytoy: my suggestion was to add a new parameter to the plugin. I didn't look at the code though.
[08:24:04] <boytoy> Oh like that, I see
[08:24:38] <prismgate> CiE: which back-end language? It's easy actually.
[08:24:41] <boytoy> prismgate: There's no way to force a mouseover or something?
[08:24:51] <Hornet> weird issue; what's the sanest way to apply some css to an iframe that's dynamically created by another JS script?
[08:25:02] <Hornet> so #iframe.load isn't usable as it's not there initially
[08:25:46] <prismgate> boytoy: you mean stopping another even happening at the same time as your mouse over? yes there is. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[08:25:58] <Hornet> best guess thus far as a looping function that checks every 100ms if it's existant yet and adds the event if so
[08:26:04] <Hornet> but that seems terrible
[08:26:15] <Cork> prismgate: haschange is for the # at the end of the url
[08:26:27] <Cork> *hashchange
[08:26:34] <myosotis> Hornet, you can apply event handlers to higher level dom elements
[08:26:50] <boytoy> prismgate: Think that would work in my case?
[08:27:00] <boytoy> Looks cool
[08:27:08] <myosotis> jQuery(document).on('click', 'a.open', function() {}) for example, that will catch clicks on anchors created after the call
[08:27:09] <prismgate> Cork: yep, you can version and append the calculated hash to the url bar
[08:27:34] <Hornet> myosotis, so .on('load', 'iframe', etc) ?
[08:27:43] <Cork> prismgate: sure, but that can't help  you verify the content of a file...
[08:27:57] <Cork> prismgate: that data is never sent to the server or anything like that
[08:28:23] <myosotis> in general yes, but I can't say for sure what events you can listen for on an iframe...
[08:30:07] <prismgate> Cork: there's a simple solution to that, you receive the external javascript using ajax, save it in an array, do client side hashing on it, verify with the last verified hash from your own server and if it matches you eval or document.write it.
[08:30:11] <prismgate> whatever is faster
[08:30:28] <Hornet> myosotis, noted, thanks
[08:30:54] <Cork> prismgate: but eval is a bigger security hole then loading a script from the server...
[08:31:51] <boytoy> Fraid not -- http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/6bNBL/3/ -- held my breath in excitement there for a while though :)
[08:32:04] <prismgate> Cork: you can document.write it.
[08:32:12] <Cork> prismgate: same thing
[08:32:19] <Cork> or actually; even worse
[08:32:32] <Cork> cause then you can inject flash or what ever you want
[08:32:50] <prismgate> Cork: even after you verified that the hash of the data you received is the same as the verified one from your server?
[08:33:07] <boytoy> Ah, yeah that wouldnt work nohow
[08:33:19] <prismgate> Cork: Don't see what logic you have that falsifies this approach as being secure
[08:33:22] <Cork> prismgate: there is a reason csp talk about unsafe-eval (and document.write, eval, Function... is all blocked by it)
[08:33:40] <Cork> prismgate: cause xss uses what you try to use to make it secure
[08:34:10] <Cork> prismgate: if the server you depend on is insecure, your site is insecure
[08:34:28] <Cork> you can NEVER build something in the javascript to make that not true
[08:34:29] <prismgate> Cork: the premise is still that our server is secure and the other server is not.
[08:34:47] <Cork> prismgate: then load the scripts from your server not there
[08:35:04] <Cork> prismgate: if you contact your server to verify the script, you have already lost the point of the cdn anyway
[08:37:29] <prismgate> Cork: ok, let's assume then that you're right and that there is no way to trust external script. How do you avoid or detect client side dom manipulation then? This should actually be not that hard in theory.
[08:37:45] <Cork> prismgate: csp
[08:37:54] <Cork> you block modifications through that
[08:38:05] <prismgate> Cork: CSP blocks DOM manipulation??
[08:38:12] <Cork> you can't really block dom modifications, but script modifications
[08:38:33] <prismgate> Cork: that would surprise me.
[08:38:50] <Cork> prismgate: csp makes ex. the console not work for example
[08:39:02] <Cork> but you can still modify the dom from the inspector
[08:39:26] <Cork> and there is no way to go around that
[08:39:48] <Cork> though sure you could store the entire page in a string and each time you touch it replace everything
[08:39:55] <Cork> that way they can't touch it
[08:40:06] <Cork> though... it would suck memory wise
[08:40:33] <Bloomberg> Cork: Hi
[08:40:40] <Cork> ello
[08:42:07] <shoky> csp can make the console not work?
[08:42:12] <Bloomberg> you has worked with fullcalendar jquery plugin?
[08:42:18] <Cork> yes
[08:42:20] <shoky> interesting. me needs to do some reading
[08:42:40] <Cork> shoky: if you don't have unsafe-eval in the script header you can't run scripts
[08:43:00] <prismgate> Cork: OK that was new to me, that you can block mod. thorugh the console. But I know that you can observe DOM changes. You could mark every change made by your server with a HMAC OTP, changing the DOM without having a valid hash would be detectable this wa.y
[08:43:08] <shoky> me definitely needs to do some reading
[08:43:42] <Cork> prismgate: man, you can't detect changed made by file...
[08:43:57] <Cork> like i said, you have one big bucket/pool
[08:44:01] <Cork> you don't have files
[08:44:13] <Cork> when javascript is loaded; it's loaded
[08:44:15] <utroda> is it possible to check the nested depth of an ul and tell what level an li is on when clicked?
[08:44:25] <Cork> you can't track to where the code executing comes from
[08:44:44] <shoky> utroda:  .parents().length  for example
[08:44:49] <Cork> utroda: $(this).parents('ul').length
[08:45:04] <utroda> shoky: will give that a try
[08:46:57] <prismgate> Cork: But DOM4 Mutation Observer allows observing the DOM and you can mark every node with a server generated hash for example. Every node with an unknown hash is not code from your server then. Do I have a logical fallacy or is there something I missing?  https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#mutation-observers
[08:49:33] <Cork> prismgate: the cost of doing all this will be higher then just loading the files from a trusted server
[08:50:00] <prismgate> Cork: So you say it's possible, but not worth it?
[08:50:02] <Cork> prismgate: cause you will spend A LOT of js time doing hashing, and observing
[08:50:11] <Cork> prismgate: it's possible to make it HARDER
[08:50:26] <Cork> but as you still can load content not trusted you can't make something secure
[08:50:40] <Cork> cause the content you load can modify you're checks
[08:50:53] <Cork> and make them match the "hacked" version
[08:51:12] <prismgate> CSP + DOM node hashing would prevet that though, no?
[08:51:35] <prismgate> because with CSP you can tell that external ressources aren't allowed to be loaded
[08:51:36] <Cork> why do you need dom node hashing?
[08:52:12] <Cork> there is no script that can change them, so nothing can make it needed
[08:52:24] <Cork> if you want to prevent the user from doing anything; you can't
[08:52:42] <prismgate> Cork: to detect changes made by clients. But I guess detecting that a client opened the Inspector would be sufficient.
[08:52:42] <Cork> they just need to run privileged code and the entire schema breaks
[08:53:03] <Cork> prismgate: you can't prevent the user from doing what they want in there browser
[08:53:23] <Cork> you can prevent third party from modifying it
[08:53:41] <prismgate> Oh, now I see the logical error. Browsers ARE made to give the user the full power over it.
[08:53:49] <Cork> yes
[08:53:59] <Cork> and also it runs on there computer
[08:54:21] <prismgate> luckily you've teached me that CSP prevents executing code from the console
[08:54:36] <Cork> that doesn't mean they can't run code for the page
[08:54:41] <Cork> it just makes it a little harder
[08:54:58] <Cork> and also don't count on it staying that way
[08:55:00] <prismgate> yes
[08:55:08] <Cork> csp is still VERY jung
[08:55:13] <Cork> *young
[08:55:18] <prismgate> German?
[08:55:22] <Cork> no
[08:55:49] <Cork> prismgate: csp hit 1.0 (stable) less then 3 months ago
[08:56:11] <Cork> also know that many browsers out there don't support csp at all yet
[08:57:43] <prismgate> I see. I thought that applying the statefullnes of the http protocol and they ways you can use it to protect from hacks could used on the client side too.
[08:58:22] <prismgate> Appears that it's compromisable on the client side and that the server can't protect the client proactively.
[08:59:15] <Cork> prismgate: you can protect the client; you can't protect your self from the client client side
[08:59:29] <Cork> that protection has to happen server side
[09:00:33] <prismgate> Cork: Thanks for the interesting discussion. Hope to continue soon, gotta go cooking. :) See you
[09:07:41] <Bloomberg> Cork: I'm doing this
[09:08:21] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/uJ256/
[09:08:53] <Cork> what are you giving this to?
[09:08:56] <Bloomberg> This <div class='detailEventTask'><a>"+calEvent.start+"</a>" bring me like this  ::  Mon Jun 24 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500
[09:09:12] <Bloomberg> Really I need to change the way to show this date
[09:09:29] <Bloomberg> How can I remove the GMT -0400
[09:09:29] <Cork> Bloomberg: there is no native way to format dates
[09:10:25] <Cork> but if all you want is to remove the zone info you can just chop it of
[09:11:33] <Bloomberg> how?
[09:12:12] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: substr( date, date.indexOf('GMT') ); I think
[09:12:15] <Cork> calEvent.start.substring(0, calEvent.start.lastIndexOf('-'))
[09:12:23] <Cork> opps ya
[09:12:25] <Cork> calEvent.start.substring(0, calEvent.start.lastIndexOf(' '))
[09:12:51] <Cork> indexOf('GMT') would work too
[09:13:12] <Cork> though i think that would grab the G
[09:14:02] <BillCriswell> d.substr(0, d.indexOf('GMT') - 1) with d being "Mon Jun 24 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500" worked in my quick test...
[09:14:11] <BillCriswell> Might want to look into something like moment.js, love that shit.
[09:15:28] <CiE> prismgate: i'm using PHP / Laravel
[09:16:12] <Bloomberg> I put this ::  calEvent.start.substring(0, calEvent.start.lastIndexOf('GMT'))
[09:16:27] <Bloomberg> And show me :: [11:14:44.662] TypeError: calEvent.start.lastIndexOf is not a function
[09:16:28] <BillCriswell> Groovy.
[09:16:50] <BillCriswell> Then just use .indexOf
[09:17:00] <BillCriswell> What browser are you on?
[09:17:14] <Cork> you might need to do toString()
[09:17:15] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: me?
[09:17:34] <BillCriswell> Cork: Didn't even think it wouldn't be a string. =/
[09:17:37] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Yes.
[09:17:42] <Cork> BillCriswell: a date
[09:17:48] <Bloomberg> Mozilla
[09:18:04] <Cork> (new Date()).toString().lastIndexOf('GMT')
[09:18:23] <BillCriswell> Cork: Haha I know. But I just thought it'd already be a string.
[09:18:37] <BillCriswell> Sun kicked my ass this weekend, not in the right state of mind for this I don't htink.
[09:18:41] <Cork> BillCriswell: typecasting
[09:18:53] <BillCriswell> Haha I understand what you're doing.
[09:19:05] <snover> you know there is a date method for retrieving the timezone offset.
[09:19:26] <Bloomberg> Cork: But now only show me 25
[09:22:42] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: How do you want the date to look?
[09:23:15] <Cork> BillCriswell: like the string up there but without the GTM- part
[09:23:23] <Bloomberg> I just need is show like this :: Mon Jun 24 2013 00:00:00
[09:23:36] <Cork> best option is prob to build the string from start instead
[09:23:48] <Bloomberg> or maybe without the 00:00:00
[09:29:43] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Personally, I dislike working with date objects in JavaScript. With moment it would be something like this: moment(calEvent.start).format('ddd MMM DD YYYY')
[09:29:56] <BillCriswell> Well, with vanilla Javascript.
[09:30:34] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: Excuse me, butwhat will be "moment"?
[09:30:41] <Cork> BillCriswell: Intl.DateTimeFormat ? :D
[09:30:49] <Cork> Bloomberg: the moment.js lib
[09:30:51] <BillCriswell> http://momentjs.com/
[09:31:04] <Bloomberg> Ok
[09:31:21] <yura_> Hello
[09:31:45] <yura_> have a question related to Dialog from jquery ui
[09:32:09] <shoky> no need to announce it, just ask
[09:32:18] <yura_> i need to trigger drag event from mousedown
[09:33:03] <Cork> yura_: why don't you just listen for the drag event from the dialog?
[09:33:15] <yura_> i do some preparation here and need then run code that runs like dragstart
[09:34:00] <yura_> becouse i have very special code...i need to make mousedown at first...
[09:35:00] <yura_> i use mousedown on titlebar
[09:35:03] <Cork> well it sounds like you try to reinvent dragStart, and that means you would have to track that
[09:35:28] <Cork> yura_: dragStart happens after mousedown, so you can't know in mousedown if it will happen
[09:36:17] <yura_> could i simulate by running code that used when user drag
[09:36:26] <yura_> starts
[09:36:48] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: tahnks os much, moment is well!!
[09:37:12] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Well worth the 5ish KBs
[09:38:37] <yura_> how i can call _mouseStart or _mouseDrag from inner of jquery.ui.draggable.js
[09:39:10] <yura_> can i call those internal func?
[09:39:30] <Cork> not reliably no
[09:39:59] <Cork> but you can access them from $.ui. if i remember correctly
[09:40:30] <yura_> interesting...will check..thnx
[09:40:34] <Cork> yura_: remember though, that you're offpist, and there is no garantees this won't break in next minor update of jquery ui
[09:41:36] <yura_> i know...by task isn't classic thats why i need such weird things
[09:41:52] <yura_> *but
[09:42:23] <Cork> yura_: well, not sure you actually need to, but as you haven't described it...
[09:43:29] <yura_> i run dialog in iframe window, i need to make moving of iframe when i move dialog
[09:44:09] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/XTLYU/
[09:44:19] <yura_> i use postMessaging to interact with parent and child
[09:44:34] <Bloomberg> I have the problem when I click an option of filter bring me the same before option
[09:58:24] <Siecje> I am trying to make the "team" checbox check all members of the team and then if you uncheck a member the team checkbox is unchecked http://jsfiddle.net/8JEFk/6/ I have all of the members wrapped in a div with an id of the value of the team checkbox
[10:00:51] <Jar45487523923> I'm Obessed with JS rather then Jquery ?
[10:21:49] <BillCriswell> Siecje: Your HTML is a bit much to read through. I'd definitely use some different HTML to make the task easier.
[10:29:49] <choover> does anyone know if there is a way to feature detect  full file uploads as opposed to devices like iphone ios6 which allows for uploads only of photos and video from camera and camera roll?
[10:30:23] <choover> Was wondering if there is a modernizr extension that might be able to help with that
[10:50:33] <Siecje> ok I cleaned up the html removed the table in the form since it was giving me issues and now it works for select all but how do I deselect the team when I unselect one of the members http://jsfiddle.net/8JEFk/10/
[10:57:47] <user_corrupt> Im new to jquery/js, and I'm trying to figure out how to rewrite the following variable declaration in order to make it add 60 to the value that gets returned:   var stickyTop = $('.textwidget').offset().top;
[11:01:49] <wagtag> Is there a way to have a local $.ajax callback function also trigger the global handler set in ajaxSetup?
[11:05:58] <shoky> Siecje: here's your fiddle, jquery-fied: http://jsfiddle.net/8JEFk/12/
[11:06:15] <shoky> Siecje: and here it is with the extra thing you wanted:  http://jsfiddle.net/8JEFk/11/
[11:07:35] <shoky> user_corrupt: what do you mean?  add 60?  +60
[11:08:31] <user_corrupt> sm: I ended up needing to subtract, and here is how I did it: http://pastebin.com/Df8CSS63
[11:11:36] <shoky> wagtag:  use  .done(...)  for the success handler on the "local" $.ajax call
[11:13:15] <wagtag> shoky: Actually this is for .error() where I need something to happen locally but also display a message in ajaxsetup.error()
[11:13:25] <shoky> wagtag: then use .fail(...)
[11:13:53] <wagtag> shoky: Thanks. I'll that method should work
[11:14:46] <aconian> http://jsbin.com/ogecil/1/  // basically I am attempting to target the spans with acctNumber and acctName classes, but have no clue how to do so.
[11:15:02] <aconian> As I understand, my code would work if the spans were a child of the span with the split class
[11:16:44] <shoky> aconian:  $(this).closest('.ui-block-a').find('.acctNumber')
[11:17:11] <shoky> change .ui-block-a to whatever is more appropriate for your html. (or add such an appropriate class)
[11:17:48] <shoky> aconian:  also in your case you could also do  $(this).siblings('.acctNumber')
[11:18:12] <shoky> but .closest() is more robust if you start changing the structure a bit
[11:21:36] <aconian> shoky, ah! I was messing with parent() to limited sucess, something like this.parent.find('.acctNumber'). I've kinda gone crosseyed since then
[11:21:42] <aconian> thank you for all of your help~
[11:24:13] <CiE> guys in jquery how can i append to an input forms name dynamically to each input?
[11:26:04] <Siecje> shoky: thanks a lot
[11:32:53] <boytoy> Hi, is there any way to add a manual "Pause" button to ResponsiveSlides? -- http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/6bNBL/1/ -- it has this built-in pause-on-hover thing (http://responsiveslides.com/) that I'm trying to manipulate with mouseover.
[11:32:57] <boytoy> I'm able to get it to pause, but as soon as I hover and and hover off again, its built-in function will resume the sliding.
[11:33:00] <boytoy> Am I barking up the wrong tree here, am I better off finding a different slider or just making my own from scratch?
[11:35:46] <aconian> boytoy, I can't help you much, as i am new to it myself, but I wouldn't go finding something new just yet.
[11:36:27] <aconian> toss the relevant function and triggers (the onMouseOver and the function that is called when that is triggered or not) on jsbin so that others can see it easily
[11:37:50] <boytoy> aconian: I got a jsfiddle, won't that do?
[11:39:13] <aconian> that'll work well enough, though it tends to be a bit less responsive
[11:39:50] <boytoy> aconian: Cool, well u must have missed it in my question, its up there if u doublecheck
[11:40:49] <boytoy> Just switched to ResponsiveSlider from jQuery Cycle, *really* don't wanna switch again :-)
[11:42:28] <amh345> is it possible to remove selected files from a multiple file input?

[11:59:09] <apparentAlias> Hello folks, quick question if I may: I'm using jQuery UI to display data in a user-friendly manner with the accordion widget. Anytime I update the content of the div's, say with - $("#accordion").html(outputString); - the style breaks and accordion disappears. I inspected the element and calling the update functions which change the .html() of the div removes all the CSS classes that jQuery UI inserts
[11:59:30] <apparentAlias> Is there a certain way to update the contents of an accordion'd div tag that doesn't break the widget?
[12:04:25] <shoky> apparentAlias: if you really want to update the full html inside (and not just the contents of the headers/content-divs) i think you'll need to .accordion('destroy') it and re-initialize it
[12:08:10] <thin> can anyone suggest a very flexible accordian plugin that allows for nested accordians?
[12:08:16] <harshamv> Trying to create a Sticky Header which is contained to a particular section of the website and then it unsticks. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17283129/jquery-sticky-header
[12:08:38] <apparentAlias> shoky: That is exactly what I was looking for, and it worked. Thank you! :)

[12:20:30] <etfreima> Can someone help me out please?
[12:20:34] <Pavlov> anyone have a workaround for jquery mobile changePage not working on ios7?
[12:21:31] <arschmitz> can you be more specific about it not working? can you reproduce in a jsbin?
[12:21:43] <arschmitz> pavlov: ^^
[12:21:55] <darnell> Hey folks.  Anyone here have much experience with jQuery Validator?
[12:22:55] <crivera> any difference between using $("[id='x']") vs $("#x")?
[12:23:16] <Pavlov> arschmitz: i've not tried to make a simple testcase, but http://forum.jquery.com/topic/changepage-in-ios-7-appears-to-be-broken has some stuff in it
[12:23:21] <CiE> hey guys can someone help me out with a jsfiddle?
[12:23:27] <Pavlov> with a simple testcase
[12:24:55] <Cork> crivera: yes
[12:25:23] <Cork> crivera: the last one is a fast has lookup, and the first is a slow attribute search
[12:25:50] <crivera> awesome. thanks, Cork
[12:26:38] <arschmitz> Pavlov: this is the first we have seen of this no one has reported a bug on it. if you could make a simple jsbin test case and submit this as an issue on github we will look into it.
[12:26:39] <Cork> has==hash
[12:29:33] <Pavlov> arschmitz: ok i'll try to find time to do it, am overly swamped today/tomorrow
[12:29:42] <Pavlov> am just trying to find an ios6 device for now
[12:35:31] <Pavlov> arschmitz: hrm, i can get it to break sometimes, but not 100%
[12:35:35] <Pavlov> using http://jsbin.com/ozabom/1
[12:35:46] <Pavlov> but the back buttons are pretty broken in my app
[12:36:43] <Pavlov> also, $.mobile.back() should skip dialogs right?
[12:43:58] <aaron1245> I'm not sure how to search for this in Google…I have a script that is selecting elements without a class or ID e.g. $('totalProduct')
[12:44:08] <aaron1245> is that an error or some shorthand syntax or something?
[12:44:10] <beshoo> Dear all , why ajax return undefined  http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/0UXY
[12:46:26] <aravindsrivats> Hi. I have 4 inputs for datepicker. But the date is changing only in the first input
[12:48:43] <Toerkeium> hello guys. I have this script: http://www.pastebin.ca/2406925 The "problem" is that when I load the page, I see first the text and then it goes into the dialog. Do you know how can I prevent that?
[12:49:09] <Toerkeium> It don't happen always, but sometimes it happens
[12:49:19] <Toerkeium> you can see it live at http://liquidaciones.dnsba.com/untitled1.php
[12:49:35] <beshoo> please advice ?
[12:49:45] <beshoo> Dear all , why ajax return undefined  http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/0UXY

[12:54:13] <shoky> beshoo ^
[12:54:29] <shoky> oh, didn't notice the async: false
[12:54:39] <shoky> ?async @ beshoo
[12:54:39] <bot-t> beshoo, NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[12:55:06] <jedimind> thats the scariest thing that bot has ever said
[12:55:13] <jedimind> it wasnt even directed at me, but im petrified
[12:55:43] <shoky> what about..

[12:56:27] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: are you there?
[12:56:58] <aravindsrivats> http://jsfiddle.net/FZqyp/
[12:57:28] <aravindsrivats> The above fiddle works. But the same thing isn't working on my server. The only modification is that the list items are dynamically loaded.
[12:57:29] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Yes. Kind of.
[12:57:52] <Bloomberg> I was trying to do some like  ::  moment($raw['fechacreacion']).format("dddd")
[12:58:00] <Bloomberg> But doesn't allow me
[12:58:11] <Bloomberg> This works with data from database
[12:58:14] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: moment() is Javascript.
[12:58:21] <shoky> aravindsrivats: if they are dynamically loaded then you need to initialize the datepickers only AFTER they've been loaded
[12:58:33] <Bloomberg> $raw['fechacreacion'] this is a row from db
[12:58:37] <Bloomberg> hooo
[12:58:57] <aravindsrivats> shoky: I do $.holdReady until the list items are loaded.
[12:59:12] <BillCriswell> moment( '<?php echo $raw['fechacreacion'] ?>').format('dddd'); is probably what you want Bloomberg.
[12:59:19] <mikehenriquez> Hello guys, i have a question:
[12:59:27] <shoky> wtf never seen $.holdReady before
[12:59:36] <aravindsrivats> There are other inputs/buttons that work properly. but only the datepicker isn't working
[12:59:40] <NoiseEee> $.holdSteady
[12:59:41] <mikehenriquez> this is valid to apply a class to a object with that class?
[12:59:49] <mikehenriquez> $('.control').index(3).addClass('active');
[12:59:56] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Just make sure moment() understands how to parse $raw['fechacreacion']
[13:00:08] <BillCriswell> mikehenriquez: Yes.
[13:00:17] <BillCriswell> $.holdTight
[13:00:25] <aravindsrivats> to $.holdReady(true) - the .ready() isn't called until $.holdReady is set to false
[13:00:41] <mikehenriquez> BillCriswell: thanks, i was trying but is not working, but I'm going to keep trying
[13:00:42] <mikehenriquez> thanks
[13:00:53] <shoky> aravindsrivats: that seems like a backwards way of doing what you want
[13:00:59] <BillCriswell> mikehenriquez: Actually.
[13:01:11] <BillCriswell> You probably want $('.control').eq(3).addClass('active')
[13:01:12] <mikehenriquez> BillCriswell: yes?
[13:01:14] <shoky> aravindsrivats: can't help you with $.holdReady but.. just initialize the datepickers whenever you were calling $.holdReady(false)
[13:01:26] <mikehenriquez> BillCriswell: awesome, I'm going to try that
[13:01:29] <BillCriswell> Sorry about that. Brain fart.
[13:01:32] <mikehenriquez> thanks
[13:01:36] <BillCriswell> Welcoem.
[13:01:38] <mikehenriquez> BillCriswell: lol hehehehe thats ok
[13:01:41] <mikehenriquez> BillCriswell: thank you
[13:01:51] <BillCriswell> Welcome
[13:01:52] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: Did yousaw me last problem?
[13:02:03] <Bloomberg> I added here since a time ago
[13:02:07] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You said you'd keep trying.
[13:02:18] <mikehenriquez> BillCriswell: now is working :D
[13:02:23] <shoky> aravindsrivats: and btw there's no point in providing a fiddle that doesn't show what you're really doing...
[13:02:26] <BillCriswell> mikehenriquez: Awesome.
[13:02:36] <beshoo> <shoky> so how can i call the $("#ajaxReturn").html(newContent); ?  is like $("#ajaxReturn").val() ?
[13:03:30] <shoky> beshoo:  wha?   $.ajax(...).done(function(data) {  $('#ajaxReturn').html(data);  })   for example..
[13:03:44] <shoky> beshoo: just do stuff in the callback(s)
[13:03:53] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: The problem related at show time, Ok
[13:04:00] <Bloomberg> The problem that I show you is...
[13:05:02] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/XTLYU/
[13:05:03] <Bloomberg> THis
[13:05:07] <Pavlov> how can i alert() my history -- like -1, -2, etc so i can see where back should go?
[13:05:33] <Bloomberg> I have tested several options but really I don't know why doesn't works
[13:05:38] <beshoo> sorry but is this the call back ? $('#ajaxReturn').html(data);
[13:05:44] <BillCriswell> Pavlov: That could be a gross invasion of privacy if I'm understanding right.
[13:05:48] <beshoo> and the data is the function name ?
[13:05:54] <BillCriswell> shoky knows how I like my privacy.
[13:06:01] <beshoo> sorry i am new to jq
[13:06:04] <Pavlov> BillCriswell: heh i'm just trying to debug why $.mobile.back() doesn't work
[13:06:15] <beshoo> <shoky> :)
[13:06:28] <Pavlov> but yeah you're probably right :)
[13:06:42] <shoky> beshoo:  the callback is the function that you provide, that is called by jquery when the ajax is done
[13:06:56] <shoky> beshoo:  $.ajax(...).done(function(data) {  $('#ajaxReturn').html(data);  })     the function(data) { ... }  is the callback
[13:07:02] <aravindsrivats> I don't know if explaining will help, I generate 3 list-items and invoke datepickers in them. When I click on the input the date selection menu pops out individually for each of the inputs, but the value changes only in the first input.
[13:07:15] <shoky> beshoo:  and the data is the ajax response
[13:07:31] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Too much going on here. Narrow it down.
[13:07:33] <beshoo> yes i understand that
[13:07:36] <beshoo> now what is the
[13:07:37] <beshoo> $('#ajaxReturn').html(data);
[13:07:45] <shoky> beshoo:  you wrote that..
[13:07:58] <beshoo> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[13:08:04] <beshoo> it is form the website
[13:08:05] <beshoo> :)
[13:08:06] <shoky> o
[13:08:41] <beshoo> so is this mean that we create an element in the html ? with #ajaxReturn ID ?
[13:08:50] <BillCriswell> Slide 45 I think is what you want.
[13:08:54] <aravindsrivats> I am not sure that is the normal error that should happen.
[13:09:15] <shoky> beshoo:  slides 41-42 are examples of how NOT to do it
[13:10:19] <shoky> beshoo:  $('#ajaxReturn').html(data)   means:  look for the element with id="ajaxReturn"  and set its' inner-html to whatever is in "data"
[13:10:19] <beshoo> then how to DO it :)
[13:10:24] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: the problem Is that I need to reload all table when I click the left filter with the new info, but the problem is always bring me the first data
[13:10:34] <beshoo> aha
[13:10:39] <beshoo> yes i understand
[13:10:42] <shoky> beshoo: like i told you:  $.ajax(...).done(function(data) {  do stuff here with data  })
[13:11:18] <beshoo> thats is sucs , each time i need to type the ajax function
[13:11:38] <beshoo> i want to make just one global function for ajax calling
[13:11:58] <shoky> beshoo:  you can do that if you want.. you can return $.ajax(...);  from your function
[13:12:05] <shoky> and then call .done(..)  on what you returned
[13:12:14] <aravindsrivats> @shoky: It worked. I set the id attribute in addition to the name attribute
[13:12:26] <aravindsrivats> when I removed it, it worked like a charm
[13:12:31] <shoky> beshoo:  there are also $.post and $.get  and $.getJSON  as shortcuts for common options
[13:12:57] <Pavlov> does anyone know how to debug jquery mobile back?
[13:13:00] <Pavlov> since its not working :/
[13:13:04] <beshoo> <shoky> please a small examp..
[13:13:52] <Pavlov> oh, it just calls window.history.back :/
[13:14:34] <shoky> beshoo:   function doPost(dType, postData, uri) {  return $.ajax({ url: uri, dataType: dType, data: postData })  }     doPost('html', some_data, some_url).done(function(data) { .... });
[13:15:16] <Pavlov> well crap
[13:15:17] <shoky> beshoo:  though i don't see the point in making a function just for that. especially as you can use $.post or $.get if you don't like $.ajax
[13:15:45] <shoky> beshoo:  for more examples, read the documentation
[13:32:26] <poseidon> I have a button that someone clicks to start a series of ajax requests which stops uppon an error or completion.  Any suggestions for a good way to display loading
[13:32:46] <abes> Question: I am trying to find() all a tags that are not empty (i.e. <a  href="http://link.com"></a>) and this find('a:not(:empty)') doesn't seem to do the trick. Any help is appreciated!!!!
[13:33:25] <abes> poseidon: onClick show loading, on error/completiond hide loading
[13:34:46] <abes> poseidon: make a div with id="loading" that has your loading .gif in it - then when user clicks the button $("#loading").show() and then whenever it's done loading stuff or errors out call $("#loading").hide();
[13:35:13] <BillCriswell> abes: I think you want to filter on $(this).contents().length
[13:36:10] <gandul> i have this site here which has a jquery slider, its working good in firefox, but not in chrome or IE http://tinyurl.com/88stlq6
[13:36:16] <BillCriswell> abes: $('a').filter(function(){ return !$(this).contents().length; }).text('I WAS EMPTY');
[13:36:45] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/utizid/1/edit
[13:36:48] <BillCriswell> abes: ^
[13:38:02] <BillCriswell> Eh, more readable this way. http://jsbin.com/utizid/2/edit
[13:39:46] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/utizid/3/edit No idea why I had that in a console.log
[13:42:47] <bkohlmeier_> been trying to use Paul Irish's infinite scroll plugin, but appears even his demo page is broken when trying to show more content inside a scrollable div. any clue why? (getting url now)
[13:42:49] <abes> BillCriswell: nice, thank you very much!
[13:43:06] <BillCriswell> abes: Welcome.
[13:44:00] <bkohlmeier_> url: http://www.infinite-scroll.com/trigger.html  however page seems down right now, which doesn't help my cause
[13:44:20] <bkohlmeier_> it's back it appears
[13:49:40] <abes> BillCriswell: I just encountered a condition that screws me up - basically the <a> has <span> with styling inside of it, but the <span> has no content lol
[13:49:57] <abes> BillCriswell: so the condition is false as the <a> has a span inside of it, but no actual text
[13:51:09] <BillCriswell> abes: So you only want the ones without a text node?
[13:51:23] <abes> BillCriswell: correct
[13:51:45] <abes> BillCriswell: but <img> would be valid as well
[13:51:55] <abes> BillCriswell: so anything that has no image or text inside the <a>
[13:52:28] <friedbyte> I have a variable for height, but the height changes when I change the browser size
[13:52:29] <abes> BillCriswell: in essence any "ghost" link, meaning something that would be invisible from the UX perspective
[13:53:08] <friedbyte> I'm trying to use $(window).resize . . . but I'm missing something
[13:53:09] <abes> friedbyte: what is your question?
[13:54:07] <friedbyte> how does one use $(window).resize to get the height of an element that changes on browser resize?
[13:55:16] <friedbyte> here is what I have so far http://jsfiddle.net/YBC9n/
[13:56:56] <abes> friedbyte: you should add a listener to that element so whenever its dimensions change you can execute your function
[13:57:30] <BillCriswell> abes: http://jsbin.com/utizid/4/edit maybe?
[13:57:47] <BillCriswell> Should the one with <img> not show empty?
[13:59:49] <abes> BillCriswell: correct, it shouldn't - I tried what you have pasted before and I thought it doesn't work - turns out I actually have a bunch of whitespace there
[14:00:08] <abes> BillCriswell: sorry about that - I will have to add a filter
[14:01:22] <BillCriswell> abes: might have to do /\s+?/.test( $el.text() );
[14:01:39] <abes> yeah I think so
[14:02:02] <friedbyte> abes: what does a listener look like?
[14:03:09] <abes> friedbyte: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8053583/jquery-resize-listener-on-a-div
[14:04:22] <BillCriswell> abes: Just mess around with filter and you should be cool.
[14:05:45] <BillCriswell> $(this).find(*:not('img')).length === 0 along with /^\s+?$/.test( $(this).text() ); should get you close.
[14:06:35] <abes> BillCriswell: good idea - your help is greatly appreciated!!! :D
[14:06:42] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[14:13:56] <beshoo> hi all , why i can not open the dialog via coding , not with click :http://jsfiddle.net/RV6yY/2/ , you can see that there is a link you can click on it to see the dialog , but the header script can not run the dialog ?
[14:17:12] <beshoo> please advice
[14:25:22] <beshoo> any one ?
[14:33:26] <blib> we curently have templates in Jinja and would like to convert them to client side templates. Anyone who has experience with them in JS- perhaps can recommend me the one I could take a look at?
[14:33:49] <gxl> Would working from a local file on my machine have anything to do with a $("li") selector returning no results when in fact there are 50+ <li> elements on a page?
[14:42:28] <shoky> gxl: not likely that that would make a difference. working locally affects mostly ajax stuff afaik
[14:42:56] <BillCriswell> gxl: Are there any errors in the log?
[14:43:01] <BillCriswell> in the console*
[14:43:07] <beshoo> hi all , why i can not open the dialog via coding , not with click :http://jsfiddle.net/RV6yY/2/ , you can see that there is a link you can click on it to see the dialog , but the header script can not run the dialog ?
[14:43:52] <BillCriswell> Shit, have to run. Later!
[14:44:14] <gxl> No errors in the console. Acts simply like there are 0 li items on the page. I'm doing coding the script in the same flat html file so I know there is no funny business.
[14:44:31] <shoky> beshoo: look at your console.. you have a syntax error
[14:45:18] <shoky> beshoo: btw when asking about jquerymobile you should mention that
[14:45:48] <gxl> console.log($("li").length); outputs 0 to console.
[14:46:54] <gxl> Lunch calls. Will come back to this in a while.
[14:46:56] <shoky> gxl: paste the html & code on jsfiddle or somewhere
[14:54:00] <elfman> hi, i'm a little rusty, where do i go to post some code? ie, like postup or something?

[14:54:35] <shoky> `paste @ elfman
[14:54:36] <b-ot> elfman: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:58:14] <elfman> is it ok to ask a question here about a jquery plugin?
[14:58:42] <shoky> yes

[16:24:03] <mvpgraff> I have a form that I'm using and it has an action already, so I did a Jquery.post in order to send info to another server, but the other server isn't picking up the info... Is Jquery.post only meant to be on the same server?
[16:25:34] <eddiemonge> no
[16:25:47] <eddiemonge> are you getting a sop in chrome? whats the network tab show?
[16:31:38] <CiE> guys when you do a .find("input") does that include select?
[16:32:22] <mvpgraff> It doesnt show me anything eddiemonge
[16:32:47] <eddiemonge> mvpgraff: you dont see the post? are there errors in console?
[16:32:58] <mvpgraff> Oh the post happens
[16:33:04] <mvpgraff> but its not posting over to the other server
[16:33:10] <mvpgraff> http://jsfiddle.net/jwAay/5/
[16:33:14] <mvpgraff> thats what I have
[16:33:50] <mvpgraff> dont mind the === in the valid === true
[16:34:02] <mvpgraff> at the bottom, i forgot to remove that in the fiddle
[16:34:04] <sammichToo> first noob mistake of the day: didn't add parens to a function call, wonders why jQuery was throwing a weird error with my function body in it
[16:34:14] <eddiemonge> CiE: no. you want :input http://jsfiddle.net/8H454/
[16:34:53] <eddiemonge> mvpgraff: how do you know its not posting to the other site?
[16:34:58] <CiE> thanks eddiemonge just googled it and added ,select to my find
[16:35:00] <mvpgraff> I don't see it
[16:35:06] <mvpgraff> in the mysql :l
[16:35:11] <Pavlov> is it possible to position a jquery mobile dialog at the bottom of my window rather than the top?
[16:35:19] <eddiemonge> CiE: or you could just do (':input')
[16:35:34] <eddiemonge> CiE: http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[16:35:34] <CiE> eddiemonge: and input would take any field?
[16:35:45] <elfman>  can anyone show a newbie how to run this example  =>  http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-map/wiki/jquery_ui_map_v_3_tutorial   Thanks!
[16:35:53] <eddiemonge> mvpgraff: why dont you check your server logs, or have it echo back a simple response
[16:36:26] <eddiemonge> elfman: um it says exactly how to do it
[16:37:51] <mvpgraff> Do you see anything wrong with my script though? :l
[16:38:12] <elfman> eddiemonge = > i think it did it here, but doesnt seem to work  http://jsbin.com/odomul/2/edit
[16:39:12] <eddiemonge> mvpgraff: no. it posts for me. if you see the post going through in the network tab then something is wrong on your server end
[16:39:35] <eddiemonge> elfman: you need to change PATH_TO_PLUGIN
[16:39:57] <elfman> ok
[16:40:11] <elfman> thanks!
[16:46:10] <poseidon> How do I make my javascript not proceed until a $.get is done
[16:46:53] <poseidon> When someone goes to a page, I want them to see a loading bar (indicating something is underway) or a button to initiate that something
[16:48:43] <mitchdotpro> poseidon: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[16:49:02] <boytoy> In the SlideJS function at http://jsfiddle.net/ttj2p/2/ -- how do I make another function further down set its height?
[16:50:59] <duckx0r> Is there any way to use jquery UI sortable and have it highlight the original position while dragging?
[16:51:35] <duckx0r> Something similar to http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#placeholder but in reverse. Instead of highlighting the target, it would add a placeholder where the element originally was
[16:51:39] <mvpgraff> eddiemonge so I got a success response but the info still not posting through :D
[16:52:06] <mvpgraff> w.e im going to work on something else in hopes that when i come back to it, I see something
[17:02:27] <eddiemonge> mvpgraff: i would suggest looking at your php code
[17:04:30] <dogarrhea> where is the function definition for scrollTop? i can't seem to find it
[17:08:39] <danheberden> dogarrhea: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L459
[17:11:20] <danheberden> guess they didn't want the other half https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/offset.js#L140
[17:11:22] <danheberden> oh well
[17:13:09] <yehuda> I am a relative newbie to Javascript so this is probably something stupid:-
[17:13:34] <yehuda> I do not understand why my alert isn't being fired in the following code :-
[17:13:48] <yehuda> function getProgress() {     var url = "/uploadprogress?id=abcde";     x=$.getJSON(url, function(data) { 		console.log('fired');     }      ); }
[17:14:11] <yehuda> can anyone help please
[17:15:18] <danheberden> if you're expecting that code to ever alert something, you're missing something super important
[17:15:23] <danheberden> namely, calling alert
[17:16:09] <yehuda> it did say alert in a previos incarnation :) I changed it to console log thinking that might be more effective
[17:16:32] <danheberden> sounds like you aren't getting anything valid or json back
[17:16:40] <danheberden> what does the network tab in chrome dev tools show you?
[17:16:40] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - that'd be my guess
[17:16:44] <danheberden> it should show your ajax request
[17:16:51] <danheberden> and you can look at what was returned
[17:17:03] <RandalSchwartz> are you using the latest jq?  If so, the promises stuff seems like an easier interface to me
[17:17:07] <RandalSchwartz> with .then, etc
[17:17:09] <yehuda> I am getting JSON back according to firebug
[17:17:25] <danheberden> yehuda: what version?
[17:17:43] <yehuda> 1.8.3 of jquery
[17:18:05] <danheberden> try $.getJSON(allyourstuff).fail(function(){ console.log('oops', arguments); });
[17:18:09] <danheberden> and see what's going on
[17:18:17] <RandalSchwartz> was that in 1.8?
[17:18:26] <danheberden> deferreds were added in 1.5
[17:18:33] <RandalSchwartz> ahhh right
[17:18:35] <yehuda> yes 1.8.3
[17:18:38] <danheberden> pretty sure $.getJSON returns that
[17:18:52] <danheberden> if not, $.ajax({url: 'whatever' }).fail...
[17:19:05] <danheberden> if your app is sending application/x-json then you're fine anyway
[17:19:40] <danheberden> yehuda: i'd recommend $.ajax({url: 'theurl', dataType: 'json'}) over getJSON either way
[17:19:55] <danheberden> might as well just use one method for ajax with a signature you can get used to
[17:20:03] <danheberden> instead of all these other dumb ones that exist
[17:20:43] <yehuda> danheberden: tried that with an error: and in the message it returned it just said error
[17:21:01] <danheberden> the jqXHR will have the response text in it
[17:21:26] <yehuda> the response text in jqxhr was blank
[17:22:07] <danheberden> and you're sure the server is replying with valid json
[17:22:23] <yehuda> yep
[17:22:34] <yehuda> at least according to firebug
[17:22:44] <danheberden> try just $.ajax({url:'theurl', dataType:'text'}).then(function(json){ console.log(json); });
[17:22:59] <danheberden> and make sure the server is sending a valid http code
[17:23:04] <danheberden> what is the code in the jqXHR?
[17:25:13] <poseidon> Why does this make a request every second? http://ix.io/6lS
[17:25:50] <yehuda> What is the propery name of the code?
[17:26:40] <danheberden> poseidon: checkStatus() will run it right then
[17:26:59] <danheberden> and send the output of that to setTimeout
[17:27:07] <danheberden> sent JUST the function to setTimeout
[17:27:15] <danheberden> setTimeout( checkStatus, 10000 );
[17:27:15] <poseidon> ah, haha
[17:27:16] <poseidon> thanks
[17:27:17] <danheberden> or whatever
[17:27:23] <danheberden> yehuda: i don't remember
[17:28:02] <danheberden> yehuda: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[17:28:02] <yehuda> Okay Im gonna rework the code with $.ajax and see if I can get any clues
[17:28:10] <danheberden> looks like statusCode()
[17:48:42] <CiE> anyone know how to combine multiple arrays on just their [0] id ?
[17:52:50] <Stephen> CiE: Do you mean combine based on arrayMember[n].id?
[17:53:32] <CiE> Stephen: i have 3 arrays and i would like to get index 0 of each array and create a fourth array with just the index 0 of the 3 arrays
[17:56:37] <Stephen___> CiE: Sorry about that. Ok, yes
[17:57:17] <CiE> Stephen: did you see the reply or do you want me to repost?
[17:57:20] <Stephen> There, much better
[17:57:27] <CiE>  Stephen: i have 3 arrays and i would like to get index 0 of each array and create a fourth array with just the index 0 of the 3 arrays
[17:57:34] <Stephen> I saw it. Let me get a fiddle for you
[17:58:06] <CiE> thanks
[18:05:37] <Stephen> CiE: http://jsfiddle.net/ENJSS/
[18:06:58] <CiE> Stephen: no way of doing that just in PHP?
[18:08:38] <boytoy> Hi, if I do var someHeight = 55;, and then later in a function I need to override this with var someHeight = 700; -- will jQuery automatically override it for me?
[18:10:55] <boytoy> My bad, I got this
[18:11:07] <Stephen> CiE: http://jsfiddle.net/ENJSS/1/
[18:11:12] <Stephen> Possibly more useful
[18:11:27] <Stephen> CiE: Why are you asking about PHP in a jQuery channel?
[18:12:15] <Stephen> CiE: I have no context for what you are trying to do, but a similar function should work in PHP
[18:12:33] <CiE> Stephen: asking anywhere i can lol i am cloning a div with a bunch of input fields then i'm appending to each name[0] which the 0 increments the amount of times the objects get cloned now i'm having trouble getting each input added to the database trying to figure out the best way
[18:14:15] <Stephen> CiE: PHP usually handles inputs like that best if you make their name attributes look like arrays
[18:14:21] <CiE> ex if i had input name = test[0] and cloned it it would now be test[1], so i have an array of test with 0,1 and i can't figure out how to make my controller understand that for each id of 0 for all those arrays to create a new entry in the database. If you have a better way of doing it Stephen please let me know i have waisted all day on this
[18:15:01] <Stephen> when creating your inputs, name them with the array value
[18:15:21] <Stephen> So you are listing an array of test
[18:15:56] <Stephen> and a test object has properties of test->name and test->address
[18:16:38] <CiE> Stephen can i post a fiddle of how i'm doing this currently and can you modify it to the way you are recommending?
[18:16:39] <Stephen> then there should be 4 inputs, with the name attributes of: "name[0]", "address[0]", "name[1]", and "address[1]"
[18:16:46] <Stephen> CiE: sure
[18:16:55] <CiE> http://jsfiddle.net/cvCFq/
[18:17:02] <CiE> that is the principal of how i'm doing it right now
[18:23:32] <Stephen> CiE:
[18:23:33] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/cvCFq/4/
[18:23:42] <Stephen> That should make PHP more responsive to it
[18:24:31] <Stephen> You should probably cut it down to 1 submit button though
[18:24:45] <CiE> so how do i submit to the database now or PHP should just know somehow?
[18:25:43] <Stephen> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3314567/how-to-get-form-input-array-into-php-array
[18:26:05] <Stephen> CiE: What DB are you using?
[18:26:12] <CiE> mysql
[18:26:25] <Stephen> CiE: Let's take this to msg, this is much too off topic for this chan
[18:38:35] <chee> tw2113: I DON'T KNOW I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
[18:38:38] <chee> oops
[18:39:32] <RandalSchwartz> mysql?  not maria?
[18:39:46] <RandalSchwartz> friends don't let friends use oracle-mangled products like that :)
[18:40:16] <Stephen> RandalSchwartz: Can you give me some advantages of using Maria over MySQL?
[18:40:31] <RandalSchwartz> maria is being maintained by monty and crew
[18:40:35] <RandalSchwartz> it's now the upstream of mysql
[18:40:38] <Stephen> I'm not trolling, I'd really like to know if it's any better other than licensing
[18:40:55] <RandalSchwartz> the guys at oracle have pretty much abandoned mysql
[18:41:12] <RandalSchwartz> so maria is better/faster/cheaper/drop-in-replacement
[18:41:13] <Stephen> Ah, I see
[18:41:15] <RandalSchwartz> and has more features
[18:41:23] <RandalSchwartz> like non-sql features - tree data
[18:41:37] <Stephen> Oh, Cassandra in Maria?
[18:41:38] <Stephen> Interesting
[18:41:41] <RandalSchwartz> sorta
[18:41:48] <RandalSchwartz> tree-structure data definitely
[18:41:59] <RandalSchwartz> similar to what postgresql did
[18:42:04] <RandalSchwartz> but not compatible :(
[18:43:01] <RandalSchwartz> based on my interview with monty, anyone still using mysql just is uninformed :)
[18:43:21] <RandalSchwartz> they've been very very careful to maintain drop-in compatibility
[18:43:27] <RandalSchwartz> but then you can also enable features to make it better
[18:43:58] <RandalSchwartz> of course, I'd reach for pg long before maria :)
[18:44:12] <RandalSchwartz> even though I think monty's a pretty cool guy
[18:44:35] <Stephen> Oooh, Virtual Columns
[18:44:51] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/194
[18:56:39] <rhizome> what's a good way to modify google analytics directives from within jq?
[18:57:18] <rhizome> i have some ids on certain pages i'd like to track, but thought i could do this in jq rather than putting it in my overall GA tracking code
[19:07:15] <andrewSC> oh my long johnson
[19:07:18] <andrewSC> alright
[19:07:55] <sammichToo> jQuery Mobile: how do I set the default page to be loaded? Because I only just noticed that it seems to load the previous view
[19:08:22] <sammichToo> do I have to do a page transistion with no animation?
[19:08:22] <arschmitz> sammichToo: you mean in a multipage layout
[19:08:28] <sammichToo> yeah
[19:08:34] <arschmitz> make it the first one in the dom
[19:08:43] <arschmitz> first page is what is loaded by default
[19:08:47] <andrewSC> So I've written my own js object sorting method and I'm using that but when i use the .html function to update the dom with the new array of elements in the proper order. The display of the elements is.. not as expected.. The sorting is applied diagonally.
[19:08:49] <sammichToo> argh, fark
[19:09:07] <andrewSC> So if you actually look at the elements diagonally on the page they maintain the proper sorted order
[19:09:18] <andrewSC> where i actually want row-based sorting
[19:09:18] <sammichToo> I knew that. the whole time...but I somehow assumed it was already in the top of the DOM...
[19:09:33] <sammichToo> thanks again, arschmitz
[19:09:38] <arschmitz> no problem
[19:10:15] <sammichToo> actually, I still have that problem where it loads the last open page
[19:10:25] <sammichToo> on refresh
[19:10:37] <arschmitz> ah yeah thats by design
[19:10:49] <sammichToo> is there a default I can set?
[19:10:51] <arschmitz> no
[19:11:13] <arschmitz> sammichToo: basicly it works like normal pages do
[19:11:27] <arschmitz> if you navigate through a bunch then refresh its always the last one you viewed
[19:11:33] <sammichToo> oh
[19:11:41] <sammichToo> I see, it's in window.location
[19:11:55] <arschmitz> yeah we update the url every time you navigate
[19:12:11] <arschmitz> by pushstate if supported if not with a hash update
[19:12:33] <sammichToo> okay, I'll have to see how this works. My data model doesn't quite support that
[19:12:54] <arschmitz> sammichToo: you can disable history
[19:13:08] <arschmitz> but then the back button will leave your whole site not just go back a page
[19:13:38] <andrewSC> nvm it was my sort function
[19:13:39] <arschmitz> and you will have to call changePage your self links wont work
[19:14:15] <sammichToo> can I just do something stupid like changePage on page load?
[19:14:22] <sammichToo> with no transistion
[19:14:54] <arschmitz> you can bind to pagebeforechange and change the toPage property on the data object
[19:15:25] <arschmitz> but other then that fireing changepage before pagechange has completed is not supported on inital page load
[19:16:29] <sammichToo> so where does this data live?
[19:16:53] <sammichToo> hold up
[19:18:18] <arschmitz> if you bind to pagebeforechange it is passed 2 2 things
[19:18:21] <arschmitz> and event object
[19:18:28] <arschmitz> and a data object
[19:18:57] <arschmitz> if you change data.toPage it will navigate to whatever you change it to instead
[19:22:06] <sammichToo> so modify that in the trigger body?
[19:24:35] <mitchdotpro> Any Australian-based freelancers here interested in picking up some work?
[19:24:38] <arschmitz> the handler you mean?
[19:24:48] <sammichToo> yeah, that's the word
[19:29:33] <sammichToo> arschmitz: so I go data.toPage = '#somewhere'; and it freaks out
[19:30:13] <codepython777> anyone can help me fix this : http://jsfiddle.net/MgcDU/ (mostly css problem)
[19:46:08] <jeremy-> I'm trying to load an iframe inside a dialog (which is a PDF). I need to post data to the iframe. I've worked out how to serialize the form data and send it as a URI (get), but i cant work out how to post
[19:46:11] <jeremy-> any suggestions?
[20:00:20] <`teh1> is there an event that fires when the contents of a select box change (but not necessarily the val())
[20:00:22] <`teh1> ?
[20:02:41] <shoky> `teh1: no. at least not a cross-browser one
[20:02:50] <`teh1> thanks
[20:05:50] <shoky> jeremy-: use a target attribute on the form, and submit it?
[20:09:13] <codepython777> I've an element which is getting an extra "style"=height:192px. It seems JS/JQ is setting it, how do i figure out who and when sets it?
[20:17:21] <arschmitz> sammichToo: can you make a jsbin of what your trying to do?
[20:17:32] <RandalSchwartz> s/your/you're/
[20:19:19] <tw2113> jsbins are awesome
[20:19:50] <RandalSchwartz> yeah jsbin or jsfiddle
[20:19:52] <codepython777> anyone knows why bootstrap chose not to make nav.container 100% in width?
[20:21:31] <tw2113> maybe the parent is a static width and it's not as wide as you think
[20:22:43] <RandalSchwartz> what kind of html is a "nav"? :)
[20:22:55] <RandomCouch> How can I check if a JSON object is empty?
[20:23:14] <RandalSchwartz> perhaps .keys.length
[20:23:19] <RandalSchwartz> if it was perl-like :)
[20:23:23] <boytoy> At http://jsbin.com/evehis/1/edit using the awesome new slidesjs.com slider -- how do I set its height using my customHeight variable? Trying to make it possible for different slides to have different heights.
[20:23:25] <RandalSchwartz> or = {} :)
[20:23:32] <_jgr> nav is like a div, iirc.
[20:23:50] <RandalSchwartz> uh - yeah, but there are no <nav> elements in HTML
[20:23:58] <RandalSchwartz> so there can't be "nav.container"
[20:24:03] <RandomCouch> .key.length ?
[20:24:05] <RandomCouch> does this work in js?
[20:24:08] <_jgr> er
[20:24:15] <_jgr> In HTML5 there is
[20:24:31] <boytoy> yup, for ppl too lazy to type <div id="nav"> :D
[20:24:43] <tw2113> nav = new semantic tag in html5
[20:25:11] <RandalSchwartz> ahh ok
[20:25:23] <RandalSchwartz> not fully up on html5 yet
[20:26:52] <boytoy> Rephrase: At my kitten slider at http://jsbin.com/evehis/1/edit -- what's wrong with the way I'm trying to use the customHeight variable?
[20:27:09] <jeremy-> shoky: thanks, Its supposed to allow the user to print a (filled in), form as a PDF before they actually hit submit... so the post action for the form is meant to be already designated
[20:27:27] <jeremy-> I could consider attaching jquery to the pdf/submit buttons and change the post action dynamically though
[20:27:38] <jeremy-> Thats possibly the only solution
[20:28:13] <jeremy-> I thought it would be so easy to just create a jquery dialog, make an iframe inside it, and display a PDF which is generated from post data
[20:28:55] <jeremy-> apparently nearly impossible because every ajax method doesnt allow me to reset the header.. maybe my problem is trying to use an embed when i should just grab the async data and put it into some object/embed or something
[20:30:52] <Foxhoundz> Is there an IRC room for LESS.js?
[20:30:56] <Foxhoundz> I can't find it
[21:20:06] <Pavlov> is there a way to make jquery mobile dialogs not get added to history (like popups?)
[21:51:27] <tuv> is there a typical way to restrict access to ajax handlers? or is that done like any other webapp page?
[22:41:31] <chrisTech> I see a click function in the element I'm inspecting in Google Inspector. How will I trace or find out the file that click function is in?
[22:48:50] <tw2113> doesn't the debugger tab show that?
[22:49:35] <tw2113> wrong name, i'm used to firefox
[22:49:41] <tw2113> sources tab
[22:50:21] <tw2113> maybe?
[22:50:38] <tw2113> ooh Resources tab
[22:51:51] <tw2113> one of the two

[22:54:30] <jessica_> can aby 1 help me please
[22:54:45] <jessica_> tw2113 , can you help me
[22:54:52] <tw2113> not until you actually state your issue
[22:54:58] <tw2113> it may be something i know
[22:55:05] <tw2113> it could be something beyond my knowledge
[22:55:16] <jessica_> its js php related
[22:55:22] <tw2113> that doesn't tell me anything
[22:55:43] <jessica_> http://pastebin.com/8k8MAZ4E  - my html page code , i can select a file [image] to upload from this form
[22:55:56] <jessica_> and i use this php code to save - http://pastebin.com/LZV66dni
[22:56:48] <tw2113> can't say i'm great with ajax debugging
[22:56:53] <jessica_> when i retrieve the data on page, it says - C:fakepathAntonio-2.png
[22:57:10] <jessica_> why dont i see the image
[22:57:54] <tw2113> probably because you're not using the $_FILES global
[22:58:09] <tw2113> 2 guesses what that handles
[22:59:05] <jessica_> am i saving it correctly ???
[22:59:20] <tw2113> did you read what i said?
[22:59:24] <tw2113> ??
[22:59:58] <jessica_> trying to understand
[23:00:00] <tw2113> http://www.ajaxf1.com/tutorial/ajax-file-upload-tutorial.html
[23:00:37] <tw2113> http://www.saaraan.com/2012/06/ajax-file-upload-with-php-and-jquery
[23:02:30] <jessica_> thanks this jquery example will be helpful
[23:04:00] <jessica_> is this example saving image in blob ?
[23:04:32] <tw2113> *shrug* i googled and found 2 results that used the php global $_FILES which handles file uploads
[23:04:48] <jessica_> its saving in a location
[23:04:54] <jessica_> not in the db :(
[23:05:07] <tw2113> you can grab the file location and store that in a db table
[23:05:19] <tw2113> you could base64 encode the image
[23:05:21] <tw2113> store the value
[23:05:21] <jessica_> noo, i wanna store image in blob
[23:05:25] <tw2113> decode later
[23:05:36] <jessica_> kk
[23:05:51] <tw2113> let that imagination run free!
[23:19:49] <nerdman> is there a jQuery method to result false for empty objects, example $.isFalse([]) => true, $.isFalse({}) = true, also: 0,false,"",undefined,null
[23:26:27] <shmoon> hey guys
[23:26:34] <shmoon> why s jquery animate not working with backgroundColor ?
[23:26:40] <shmoon> huhhhhhhh
[23:28:05] <_Jens> shmoon: you need jquery UI for that
[23:29:10] <shmoon> ugh
[23:29:28] <Cork> shmoon: cause you need code to parse and handle the different color types
[23:46:09] <shmoon> Cork: so what color type should work by default? i dont want to get jqui
[23:46:18] <Cork> shmoon: none
[23:46:27] <Cork> all color formats needs parsing
[23:46:48] <shmoon> ok
[23:47:01] <Cork> #rgb, rgb(), hsa(), rgba(), #argb
[23:47:12] <Cork> and color names
[23:50:18] * tw2113 thinks Cork's real name is spelled Quark :)
