[12:32:28] <KnightsOfni> Hello, I have this helper button on a page, which submits a form that is placed in the footer. Problem si that when I manually submit that form with this helper button, the form in the footer takes focus and it scrolls all the way down... any way to prevent this?
[12:53:54] <robertmaxrees> KnightsOfni without seeing any other code, dunno.  that's not default behavior.
[13:09:16] <KnightsOfni> @robertmaxrees, when you go here: https://dev.linxpot.net/ - form under 'how team collaboration works'
[13:21:58] <robertmaxrees> how do i replicate the but?
[13:22:01] <robertmaxrees> *bug
[13:22:06] <robertmaxrees> KnightsOfni
[13:22:50] <robertmaxrees> oh, easy. you need to update your form validation.
[13:24:44] <robertmaxrees> you have an event handler that submits $('.subscribe-email'), which is in the footer.  just setup the two forms correctly and go from there.
[13:31:30] <KnightsOfni> what do you mean setup the two forms correctly?
[13:31:59] <KnightsOfni> @robertmaxrees,
[13:32:33] <robertmaxrees> (fyi putting the @ in front of my uname doesn't ping me - client trips up_
[13:32:43] <robertmaxrees> the event handler for the top form's submit is triggering the bottom form's submit.
[13:33:02] <KnightsOfni> Yes, that's what needs to happen, the form in the footer needs to be submitted.
[13:33:07] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:33:17] <robertmaxrees> why not submit the form the user is editing??
[13:33:41] <KnightsOfni> Because whoever wrote this used some crappy wordpress plugin gravity forms and it's setup that all the tracking happens on that form in the footer
[13:34:02] <KnightsOfni> It needs to be that form, because it's generated by gravity forms
[13:34:35] <robertmaxrees> did you add this form in the middle of the page?
[13:34:46] <KnightsOfni> It just needs to be submitted without gaining focus
[13:34:58] <robertmaxrees> oh okay.
[13:35:04] <robertmaxrees> well then the issue is that the validation is firing.
[13:35:28] <robertmaxrees> (which is firing because the user didn't enter anything into it)
[13:35:36] <KnightsOfni> I see
[13:35:46] <KnightsOfni> so using .val() does not trigger the validation?
[13:35:49] <robertmaxrees> because there's nothing in that form, submitting it doesn't make sense.
[13:36:01] <robertmaxrees> depends entirely on how the validation is setup.
[13:36:08] <KnightsOfni> I do put something in there... the email that is entered in the form at the top
[13:36:18] <KnightsOfni> $newsletterForm.find('#input_2_1').val(email);
[13:36:49] <robertmaxrees> oh, i was just looking at the state where the user hasn't entered anything.
[13:37:43] <KnightsOfni> Nono, it works and gets submitted correctly, it just should not scroll all the way down there when doing so
[13:38:26] <robertmaxrees> then something is causing the browser to scroll.
[13:40:53] <KnightsOfni> What is?
[13:41:03] <robertmaxrees> some javascript on the page somewhere.
[13:41:13] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: are you asking somebody to dig into it and figure it out?
[13:42:12] <KnightsOfni> I'm asking if someone can see it right away
[13:42:23] <KnightsOfni> I can't figure out what is causing it
[13:42:26] <robertmaxrees> see what?  the cause of the page scrolling?
[13:42:36] <KnightsOfni> Yes
[13:43:22] <robertmaxrees> ah gotcha.  yeah, not readily apparently without digging through allt hat code.  looks like there are some scrollTop calls in there.
[13:43:33] <robertmaxrees> and some .animate calls
[13:44:06] <robertmaxrees> why not look at the event handlers bound to that .subscribe-email?
[13:44:18] <KnightsOfni> Let me check
[13:44:34] <KnightsOfni> This stupid wordpress plugin
[13:44:41] <KnightsOfni> Why do people use a plugin to make forms
[13:45:12] <robertmaxrees> nothing wrong with that so long as it does what you need it to do.  sounds like you may have grown past this plugin and need to do your own custom implementation.
[13:46:50] <KnightsOfni> Can't see anything that makes it scroll
[13:47:08] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[13:47:26] <KnightsOfni> https://docs.gravityforms.com/disable-automatic-scroll-form-confirmation/#disabling-automatic-scrolling-on-all-forms
[13:47:30] <KnightsOfni> Maybe that's the issue
[13:47:46] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: sounds like you'll want to head to their support channels and go from there :)
[13:49:11] <KnightsOfni> That solves it apperently
[13:49:19] <robertmaxrees> okie
[13:50:02] <KnightsOfni> Thanks :)
[13:50:44] <robertmaxrees> sure
[18:20:02] <mulch2> what's a stackbomb?
[18:20:12] <robertmaxrees> context?
[18:21:35] <mulch2> someone referred to a block of code as a potential "stackbomb" -- i googled and see it mentioned but with no definition. seems like jargon -- i googled "a stackbomb is" -- no real hits.
[18:22:04] <robertmaxrees> usually something that can "blow up the stack" ie runs enough times that you exhaust memory.
[18:22:28] <mulch2> ahh, like a loop with no max attempts
[18:22:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, or a recursive function with no way out.
[18:22:57] <mulch2> that was a context btw -- a timer checking for the existence of an elem in the dom
[18:23:02] <mulch2> a=the
[18:23:16] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[18:23:32] <robertmaxrees> if you do a timer like that incorrectly, then yeah that's a solid way to mess that up
[18:23:41] <mulch2> thank you
[18:23:57] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:24:14] <mulch2> and also thanks for the direction with that visual wavs plugin i asked you about a week or so ago.
[18:24:26] <robertmaxrees> not sure i recall that but sure haha
[18:24:27] <mulch2> it was def a timing thing -- and i ended up getting it to work :)
[18:24:59] <mulch2> https://foobar404.github.io/Wave.js/#/docs
[18:25:25] <mulch2> altho i can't figure out how to get it working on mobile ios, which is kind of a bummer.
[18:25:39] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: i help people here all the time and have a dayjob that has me looking at all sorts of stuff.  no recollection.  glad you got it though :)
[18:25:39] <mulch2> why are they so difficult?
[18:25:50] <robertmaxrees> why's what so difficult?
[18:26:05] <mulch2> mobile OSs or browsers
[18:26:10] <robertmaxrees> they aren't.
[18:26:29] <robertmaxrees> you mean accounting for touch devices in general?
[18:26:32] <mulch2> like, why doesn't that plugin work in mobile browser?
[18:26:49] <robertmaxrees> define "doesn't work"
[18:27:04] <mulch2> it deosn't do anything, but i can't see any errors.
[18:27:29] <robertmaxrees> did you look at the repo to see if anybody has filed an issue?
[18:28:06] <mulch2> yeah, somone said they couldn't get it working with specificially safari ios, but they implied that it worked elsewhere.
[18:28:18] <mulch2> ive tried in multiple ios browsers.
[18:28:22] <mulch2> including chrome.
[18:28:31] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: technically every browser on ios IS safari under the hood.
[18:28:57] <mulch2> it will work in desktop chrome's mobile sim in dev tools
[18:28:57] <robertmaxrees> due to apple's restrictive policies.
[18:29:05] <robertmaxrees> sure, that's not the same though
[18:29:17] <robertmaxrees> different rendering engine, might be a different js engine - can't remember.
[18:29:26] <robertmaxrees> basically mobile chrome on ios is just re-skinned safari.
[18:29:33] <mulch2> oh, wow
[18:30:40] <mulch2> wish i had a droid to check -- but i mean, i have checked it on android tv
[18:30:50] <mulch2> wait -- i have a kindle, i forgot
[18:31:02] <robertmaxrees> if you checked it on desktop chrome in emulation, you're very likely fine.
[18:31:15] <mulch2> so it's an apple restriction, fair to say?
[18:31:23] <robertmaxrees> what is?
[18:31:34] <mulch2> the fact that the js isn't executing
[18:31:38] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[18:31:43] <robertmaxrees> could be all kinds of things.
[18:32:03] <robertmaxrees> likely just a quirk in how safari works.
[18:32:18] <mulch2> hmm
[18:32:31] <robertmaxrees> dunno without researching it though.
[18:33:34] <mulch2> worth mentioning that it also doesn't work in desktop safari.
[18:33:43] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: okay lol
[18:34:00] <robertmaxrees> i don't run apple and that has nothing to do with jquery sooo ;)
[18:34:03] <mulch2> and your saying that every ios browser is a reskinned safari makes sense
[18:34:12] <robertmaxrees> just on mobile.
[18:34:18] <mulch2> right
[18:34:22] <robertmaxrees> and that's last i checked.  that may have changed.
[18:34:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm rarely using bleeding-edge stuff or get into some of the different APIs.
[18:35:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in ##javascript if you have more questions though :)
[18:36:17] <mulch2> you're smarter than everyone else, though.
[18:36:21] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[18:36:28] <robertmaxrees> plus none of this has to do with jquery ;)
[18:36:54] <mulch2> haha, fair enough.
