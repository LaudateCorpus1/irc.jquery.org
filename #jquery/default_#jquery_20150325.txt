[00:17:15] <morenoh149> how do I perform a put/patch with $.ajax?
[00:18:29] <Cork> morenoh149: just like you would perform get or post
[00:18:41] <morenoh149> $.put() okay
[00:18:44] <Cork> no
[00:18:52] <Cork> there isn't a dedicated function for it
[00:19:01] <Cork> you did ask about $.ajax
[00:19:58] <morenoh149> Cork: if you had to pick put or patch which would it be?
[00:20:33] <Cork> morenoh149: patch is a synonym for post
[00:20:44] <Cork> morenoh149: and put is only meaningful if your doing restful
[00:20:55] <Cork> *you're
[00:21:18] <morenoh149> http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#crud-verbs-and-actions so I guess I'm going with put
[00:24:01] <Uhkis> wow, Cork fixing his typos/english annoyances!
[00:24:56] <Cork> O-o
[00:26:15] <Uhkis> never seen that before!
[00:27:54] <Cork> Uhkis: then you should open your eyes
[00:28:06] <Cork> i do that a lot
[00:30:41] <Uhkis> typos yeah, grammar fails, not so much
[00:46:05] <Cork> Uhkis: it depends on the situation, with lots of questions i won't plow down time correcting a missing "'"
[00:47:58] <Uhkis> makes sense
[01:20:48] <sonnie> hi there, how can a function be called in several 'change' events? such as $('#obj1').change(function(){ blabla }); $('#obj2').change(function(){ blabla-same-procedure });
[01:21:57] <Cork> sonnie: either bind the change with one selector or use a named function
[01:22:14] <Cork> $('#obj1, #obj2').change(
[01:23:23] <sonnie> thanks!
[02:11:05] <marrrk> Hello. How do I get a list of all elements that match $(“.someClass“)?
[02:11:22] <Cork> marrrk: like that
[02:11:32] <Cork> it gives you an array of all the matching elements
[02:11:51] <marrrk> good.
[02:21:52] <Uhkis> lol
[02:25:18] <marrrk> this seems to trigger everything at once: https://gist.github.com/i-am-the-slime/1b9c6114227d6ac72bd5
[02:27:31] <jangoh> My jquery image mapster not working on live site http://www.chicagorentfinders.com/  but works fine on localhost
[02:27:54] <jangoh> is there any conflicts?
[02:28:34] <jangoh> map areas are clickable but highlight part is not working
[02:29:05] <Biganon> Hi ! I load jquery in <head>, and have a script in <body> (<script>...) that, on document ready, calls autocomplete() on an input fiel
[02:29:16] <Biganon> yet I get an "autocomplete is not a function" error, as if jquery was not ready
[02:29:29] <Cork> Biganon: autocomplete isn't part of jquery
[02:29:36] <Cork> it's a jquery ui widget
[02:29:49] <Biganon> oh true :|
[02:29:51] <Biganon> thanks
[02:31:06] <jangoh> Cork any idea why the highlight isnt working but image mapster plugin is working
[02:31:21] <jangoh> its working fine on localhost
[02:31:40] <jangoh> guess any other script is conflicts there
[02:32:08] <jangoh> no error from debug
[02:32:29] <Cork> cause it uses $ and not jQuery
[02:32:48] <Cork> (like the rest of the jquery calls in the page)
[02:33:53] <jangoh> ow man its correct i just updated and working
[02:34:03] <jangoh> check :) thanks
[02:50:02] <jangoh> bbl
[04:15:21] <varrg> I've got an element absolutely positioned, with an angle (css transform), I want to scale it to normal size, animating both height and width and opacity. Problem is, I need it to grow out from a specific coordinate, and show(duration) will grow it from left to right in 45deg
[04:15:42] <varrg> The element is a <img> of a leaf, and it should grow out from the twig tip
[04:15:53] <varrg> hence the exact coordinates and angle. Tips?
[04:15:58] <Cork> varrg: simplest is prob to use zoom instead
[04:16:11] <Cork> or is it called scale...
[04:16:29] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform#scale
[04:17:07] <Cork> varrg: you could also do it by using the translate to move the elements position by 50%
[04:17:09] <varrg> Cork, https://api.jqueryui.com/scale-effect/ this?
[04:17:21] <Cork> then when you change the height it will just always be centered
[04:17:27] <Cork> varrg: no
[04:17:56] <varrg> let me get a fiddle up
[04:25:25] <varrg> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/Ljv7cvwr/
[04:26:13] <varrg> another way I tried: http://jsfiddle.net/Ljv7cvwr/1/
[04:26:28] <Cork> varrg: why do you need that external plugin?
[04:26:41] <Cork> just set the transform value in a class and apply that
[04:26:51] <varrg> Cork, I think, because it is crossbrowser
[04:26:58] <Cork> so is css
[04:27:16] <varrg> not so much for older browsers
[04:27:29] <Cork> you can't do angle with older browsers
[04:27:32] <Cork> at all
[04:27:45] <Cork> well except modifying the raw png that is
[04:28:01] <varrg> well, never mind me using that external library, just look through it that it uses transform
[04:28:39] <Cork> well it matters as it complicates the code for no reason
[04:29:16] <varrg> it doesn't complicate the issue
[04:30:06] <Cork> yes, cause it means you can't use transform
[04:30:17] <Cork> as the plugin will conflict with it
[04:33:12] <Cork> varrg: http://jsfiddle.net/Ljv7cvwr/2/
[04:33:27] <Omar-> varrg http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/Ljv7cvwr/3/
[04:34:29] <varrg> you made no changes?
[04:34:38] <Cork> Omar-: you forgot there is more then webkits on the web
[04:34:46] <Omar-> resize screen
[04:35:02] <Omar-> Cork yea, it's just to give him an idea
[04:35:22] <Cork> also you didn't fix the position problem he had >_>
[04:35:25] <Omar-> -webkit- , -moz- and transform
[04:35:36] <varrg> I don't get it
[04:35:38] <Cork> Omar-: you don't need anything except transform and -webkit-transform
[04:35:50] <Cork> cause apple is slow
[04:35:57] <Omar-> he wanted to fix the leaf even when screen is resized, right?
[04:36:02] <varrg> no
[04:36:14] <Cork> Omar-: he want the resize to be from the center of the leaf
[04:36:16] <varrg> I want it to grow out of the twig tip
[04:36:29] <varrg> now it grows from left to right
[04:36:33] <Omar-> ohh
[04:36:54] <Cork> varrg: http://jsfiddle.net/Ljv7cvwr/4/
[04:36:56] <Cork> that then
[04:37:52] <Omar-> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/Ljv7cvwr/5/
[04:38:21] <Cork> Omar-: no tyhat slides it
[04:38:26] <Cork> *that
[04:38:36] <varrg> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/Ljv7cvwr/6/ I removed the external resource
[04:38:58] <Cork> varrg: already done in /4/
[04:39:28] <Omar-> Cork hmmm..
[04:39:30] <Omar-> i hate css
[04:39:31] <Cork> varrg: the reason it needs to go is cause you need to set rotate AND translate
[04:39:45] <varrg> hm I see
[04:40:35] <Cork> Omar-: it isn't normally that bad, though transform can be a bit confusing at times
[04:40:45] <Cork> damn powerful though
[04:42:49] <Omar-> Cork true. you need to try and try and try until you nail it
[04:43:09] <Cork> and when we're at it http://jsfiddle.net/Ljv7cvwr/7/
[04:43:15] <Cork> fixing the position problem
[04:43:19] <Omar-> so he wants to start transition from right to left
[04:43:54] <Omar-> this looks great Cork
[04:44:09] <Cork> i L-O-V-E css calc
[04:44:17] <varrg> how about several leaves, different [x,y,angle]? http://jsfiddle.net/Ljv7cvwr/8/
[04:44:18] <Cork> it solves sooo many problems
[04:44:37] <Cork> varrg: create a class for each position
[04:45:19] <varrg> mm. I need to read up about translate()
[04:45:21] <Cork> move the generic css into fallingleaf and the specific ones into leaf1 and so on
[04:46:54] <Cork> and yes calc is cross browser in all browsers supporting transform
[04:47:11] <Cork> heck it is even cross browser in some browser that doesn't support it
[04:48:20] <Cork> varrg: you could do this entirely in css if you like :D
[04:48:30] <Cork> but ya, height animations in css is... sad
[04:49:38] <varrg> dunno how to manage translate() http://jsfiddle.net/Ljv7cvwr/9/
[04:49:58] <Cork> varrg: the point is to not do it in js
[04:50:14] <Cork> css should be in the css file not in js
[04:50:28] <varrg> Cork, I'll fix that later though, need to learn how to manage translate
[04:50:33] <varrg> first of, what it does
[04:50:47] <Cork> translate moves the element when it renders
[04:51:17] <varrg> so, in this situation, it moves it while it rotates*?
[04:51:18] <Omar-> check this http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/Ljv7cvwr/10/
[04:51:19] <Cork> so for ex. transformX(100%) moves the element to the right 100% of it's width
[04:51:25] <Omar-> using nth-child()
[04:51:33] <Cork> varrg: it moves it and rotates it
[04:51:42] <Cork> varrg: not really while
[04:52:04] <varrg> alright
[04:52:05] <Cork> Omar++
[04:52:16] <Omar-> :D
[04:52:29] <varrg> what does transform: translate3d(0,0,0); do?
[04:52:30] <krasimir> hi all , https://jsfiddle.net/cp90xjud/  :  I have this snippet using the tooltip from the ui addon , but if I load an external page viq ajax that the the tooltip doesn't bind to the elements in this new content.
[04:52:33] <Omar-> no need to use x,y in function
[04:52:39] <krasimir> can you give me some pointers how to solve.
[04:52:48] <Omar-> varrg it fixes leaves even if you resize window
[04:53:03] <varrg> I see
[04:53:04] <krasimir> usually I would use document on , but on this one I don't know which event to use.
[04:53:12] <Omar-> try resize result's box height and width
[04:53:40] <Omar-> krasimir delegate the event
[04:53:53] <Omar-> to affect dynamically added elements
[04:54:37] <krasimir> Omar- not sure what it means to delegate an event , Let me do some reading.
[04:54:37] <Omar-> oh, there's no event
[04:54:49] <varrg> alright, think I got enough information to proceed, thank you Omar- & Cork
[04:54:55] <varrg> I'm off now -
[04:54:57] <Omar-> then you need to attached method to dynamically added elements
[04:55:03] <Omar-> varrg np :)
[04:56:46] <Omar-> krasimir https://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/cp90xjud/1/
[04:57:49] <krasimir> good aproach , let me try it.
[04:57:59] <Omar-> sure
[04:59:18] <[Non]> hi
[04:59:33] <[Non]> i am searching somethings name
[04:59:50] <[Non]> think about search input on the left, and the right site there must be an option "where will i search?"
[04:59:52] <[Non]> like users or topics
[04:59:59] <[Non]> and this must be change the onSubmit value
[05:00:18] <[Non]> how can i accomplish this? or how can i search that kind of thing in google
[05:00:57] <krasimir> Omar- it didn;t work , but I solved it by putting $(".tooltip").tooltip(); in the onComplete:function(){ in the ajax call function
[05:01:12] <Omar-> krasimir good idea too
[05:01:42] <[Non]> http://codepen.io/cssjockey/pen/ILapH
[05:01:48] <[Non]> like this but how can i change form onSubmit value?
[05:03:02] <Xatenev> hello guys :) fast question
[05:03:13] <Xatenev> ive tried this code to reset all forms on page $('form').each(function () {
[05:03:13] <Xatenev>    this.reset()
[05:03:13] <Xatenev> });
[05:03:25] <Xatenev> because im building a filter, and firefox caches the checkbox values on reload
[05:03:34] <Xatenev> but the checkboxes are still set on reloading the page :\
[05:04:14] <Xatenev> any idea on this?
[05:04:42] <quuxman> Xatenev: I believe there are attributes that tell the browser _not_ to auto-fill form inputs
[05:04:52] <Xatenev> theres autocomplete=Off
[05:04:57] <Xatenev> but xhtml validator says nooo :P
[05:05:10] <Xatenev> and my lead dev will kill me if there are ~100 errors
[05:05:15] <quuxman> typically they're used for input fields for sensitive data, like credit card info
[05:05:31] <quuxman> Xatenev: I would highly recommend not using XHTML, and use HTML5
[05:05:59] <kostodo> If I have two absolutely positioned elements foo (on top), bar (bottom), and bar is offset 10px to the right of foo, and foo has 0.5 opacity is there a way that I can clip off the overlap of bar so that it doesn't show through foo's opacity?
[05:06:22] <quuxman> Xatenev: are you alse giving these fields a value?
[05:06:30] <Cork> quuxman: html. not html5 :)
[05:06:50] <Cork> they dropped the version number in the spec
[05:06:55] <quuxman> Cork: What? there is little reason not to use "<!DOCTYPE HTML>"
[05:07:05] <quuxman> ah
[05:07:07] <Cork> quuxman: that is the html doctype
[05:07:16] <Cork> vs html4
[05:07:37] <quuxman> thanks for the update on nomenclature or whatever
[05:08:39] <Cork> also Xatenev you should most likely switch the doctype anyway as i can almost guarantee you aren't using xhtml anyway
[05:08:43] <quuxman> So I have this problem with dynamically loading user-generated css, and not being able to detect when there's a warning
[05:08:59] <Cork> as basically every site stating xhtml in the doctype didn't
[05:09:03] <quuxman> Is there a way to specify a handler that's called in the event that would generate a console warning?
[05:09:27] <Cork> oh, good question
[05:09:35] <Cork> never looked for css error catching
[05:09:36] <Omar-> Xatenev this[0].reset()
[05:09:39] <Cork> i THINK the answer is no
[05:09:57] <quuxman> It's relatively easy to cach errors from loading JS, but CSS.... I really can't figure out how to tell if there were errors or not
[05:10:06] <Cork> Omar-: that only works for the entire form though
[05:10:22] <Omar-> Cork yea. isn't this what he wanted?
[05:10:43] <Cork> Omar-: autocomplete works for fields too
[05:10:51] <Cork> not just the entire form
[05:11:33] <Cork> quuxman: only option i can think of is to use a server side parser
[05:11:49] <quuxman> It either _just works_, or if there's a syntax error, frequently none of the CSS (at least after the syntax error) is applied at all, and there's no way to programmatically detect
[05:12:12] <quuxman> There's also JS CSS linters... but.... ew
[05:12:15] <Omar-> Cork got it.
[05:12:17] <quuxman> I want the actual browser warnings
[05:12:24] <Omar-> i mean your note
[05:12:27] <Cork> quuxman: i don't think you can
[05:13:35] <quuxman> In the greater scope, it would be extremely useful to handle browser warnings.
[05:13:52] <Cork> ya, but remember it is separate engines
[05:13:57] <Cork> there isn't a js error for css errors
[05:14:06] <Cork> just like there isn't a js error for html parser errors
[05:14:22] <quuxman> But I can live with that... I can use JS to inspect the DOM and see what happened
[05:15:12] <quuxman> I guess similarly I can inspect the CSS, and guess if it was succesfully applied, by throwing in a sort of "CSS cookie" and seeing if it appears as an applied style rule
[05:15:33] <Cork> quuxman: sadly no
[05:15:48] <Cork> as a faulty line can be ignored without stopping the parser
[05:15:53] <Cork> it just skips that rule
[05:16:09] <quuxman> Before the user css is applied, I can append ".special-inspector-element { left:123412; }" and then check if the element has that exact left value
[05:16:41] <quuxman> but you're right, browsers are way too good at parsing bad CSS, so it's sketchy information at best of what was actually applied
[05:17:00] <Cork> quuxman: .important-style-rule { faltu*rule: special; } .special-inspector-element { left:123412; }
[05:17:08] <Cork> special-inspector-element would still apply just fine
[05:17:22] <Cork> but important-style-rule would be skipped
[05:17:44] <Cork> a better example is
[05:17:56] <Cork> quuxman: .important-style-rule { faltu*rule: special width: 150px; } .special-inspector-element { left:123412; }
[05:18:08] <quuxman> Even if you're not in the case of user-generated content, I see production sites suffering badly from this, where network latency causes a critical bit of CSS to not load, and the entire site is blank, or rendered woefully incorrectly
[05:18:13] <Cork> the missing ; means the width doesn't get applied
[05:19:00] <Cork> quuxman: well sure, but if the css is crittical for the site to work at all you should load it in a different matter
[05:19:15] <Cork> quuxman: you can have a css file fail without the page breaking if you do it right
[05:19:23] <quuxman> definitely
[05:19:30] <Cork> but ya, many don't bother thinking about that
[05:19:46] <quuxman> Hmm, maybe I should apply it after a parsing pass
[05:19:46] <Cork> and site monitoring is usually the best option
[05:19:55] <Cork> not waiting for a visitor to have a broken experience
[05:19:59] <quuxman> I parse the user's CSS rules, then apply them one rule at a time
[05:20:11] <Cork> that is very slow
[05:20:26] <Cork> each time you modify the rule sets the entire page has to be updated
[05:20:32] <Cork> so you want to avoid that if you can
[05:21:07] <quuxman> My use case is I want the user to be able to type in CSS, and see it updating with each key press. I have this implemneted just fine, the problem is when they're in the middle of typing out an attribute or CSS rule, it fails, and _all_ the rules go away
[05:21:49] <Cork> quuxman: use a library to validate the rules before you apply them
[05:21:49] <quuxman> And there's no easy way to detect the failure case, and _not_ load the CSS
[05:21:55] <Cork> and filter out the broken parts
[05:22:04] <Cork> that would be the correct way to do it
[05:22:09] <quuxman> Yeah, you're right
[05:22:11] <agli> guys, i have a problem with colorpicker explained here: http://pastebin.com/wLa7RsjW
[05:22:52] <Cork> like something based on http://csslint.net/
[05:23:08] <Cork> https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint
[05:23:11] <quuxman> Cork: but what about the nice hack of doing it line-by-line, and only updating the particular line they're working on?
[05:23:31] <quuxman> Then you don't have to do any error correction
[05:23:40] <Cork> quuxman: if you by updating mean updating the stylesheet that is the same thing
[05:23:43] <quuxman> And by line, I mean CSS rule. You'd have to do a bit of parsing
[05:24:12] <Cork> if you by line, by line mean finding the matching elements and doing direct element modification of the style
[05:24:16] <Cork> that might work
[05:24:20] <Cork> though cleaning up might be hard
[05:24:28] <quuxman> Yeah, that's a scary solution
[05:24:41] <quuxman> They may already have code that applies styles directly to elements that would conflict with that
[05:24:55] <Cork> as soon as you touch the rules in document.styleSheets you trigger a redraw of the page
[05:25:12] <Cork> so ya, you should be careful about doing that
[05:25:13] <quuxman> globally? ouch
[05:25:18] <Cork> yes
[05:25:19] <Cork> global
[05:25:34] <Cork> as it has to walk every element to see if an element matches that didn't before
[05:26:07] <quuxman> Right, but I figured it would send the elements needing redrawing into a queue, and then attempt to not do a global redraw
[05:26:28] <samssh> quuxman, You should have a look at the JSBom code.
[05:26:29] <Cork> browsers doesn't work like that
[05:26:33] <samssh> *JSBin
[05:27:14] <Cork> quuxman: they walk the dom checking if there is a rule matching the element building a css tree from that
[05:27:38] <Cork> this tree is later used to make dynamically toggling classes and so on fast
[05:28:02] <Cork> the problem is when you modify the stylesheet the browser can't reliably know what the state change means
[05:28:06] <quuxman> that makes sense. The CSS is generally the more static part
[05:28:11] <Cork> so it has to blow everything away and start anew
[05:29:04] <quuxman> I don't think performance is particularly critical in this case, because it's a UI feedback bonus. It will be rate limited / throttled
[05:29:35] <quuxman> but as the page gets more complex, ideally the throttling would adapt to updating the CSS rules more slowly
[05:31:08] <Cork> if you aren't modifying the entire page you could try using a scoped <style>
[05:31:36] <Cork> haven't played with the performance of that one though, so not sure if that gives better performance or not
[05:35:50] <quuxman> Ah yes, I should be using these new things... aren't they called "components"?
[05:36:16] <SirLagz> is there a 'correct' way of inserting html code into a div ?
[05:36:30] <SirLagz> I used .html(function) to do it...just wondering if there's a more correct way of doing things
[05:36:40] <Cork> SirLagz: no that is the correct way
[05:36:43] <quuxman> $(HTML_CODE).appendTo('div#the_div')
[05:36:49] <Cork> quuxman: compontents is very veery new
[05:36:58] <Cork> quuxman: that is actually not the correct way
[05:36:59] <SirLagz> Cork: awesome, thanks
[05:37:07] <Cork> as that can get parsed as a selector if you're unlucky
[05:37:20] <Azitrex_> is possible to merge multiple property assigned to one value in css ? you could to see three property value is one things (10px) and how can i to write three property and i just write '10px' by one ?
[05:37:21] <Azitrex_> .css({
[05:37:22] <Azitrex_>    'font-size' : '10px',
[05:37:22] <Azitrex_>    'width' : '10px',
[05:37:22] <Azitrex_>    'height' : '10px'
[05:37:22] <Azitrex_> });
[05:37:56] <quuxman> ah sorry, yeah, .html() is a lot closer to what was asked
[05:38:37] <deepy> Azitrex_: if not you could write a function with a loop that returns it
[05:39:01] <quuxman> Cork: I haven't actually heard of scoped CSS. Is this feature a part of the upcoming component spec, or is it something else?
[05:39:18] <Cork> quuxman: scoped has nothing to do with components
[05:39:41] <Cork> quuxman: it just means a <style> tag inside an element only affect elements inside that element
[05:40:01] <Cork> quuxman: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style#Attributes
[05:40:20] <Azitrex_> i saw a thing similar to .css({
[05:40:20] <Azitrex_> {'font-size','width','height'} : '10px'
[05:40:20] <Azitrex_> }); but i dont find the link of trick
[05:40:36] <Cork> Azitrex_: that isn't even valid
[05:40:50] <Cork> you can't have an object without values
[05:41:18] <Cork> the parser will throw at { 'string', 'string' }
[05:41:27] <quuxman> Cork: wild, I never ran across this attribute. So it wouldn't apply at all to external CSS?
[05:41:37] <Azitrex_> yeah i know Cork
[05:41:37] <deepy> Azitrex_: can't you just write a function that returns what you want?
[05:41:44] <Azitrex_> so no way to have similar this thing ?
[05:42:04] <Cork> quuxman: external css is loaded through <link> and as far as i know it isn't valid in body
[05:42:06] <Azitrex_> i dont want to write additional code i want to find a shorter way
[05:42:21] <deepy> You write additional code once, then you have a shorter way forever
[05:42:24] <quuxman> Cork: thanks for that tip. scoped could be useful
[05:43:18] <Cork> Azitrex_: var size = '10px'; .css({ 'font-size' : size, width: size, height: size });
[05:43:22] <Cork> the best you can get
[05:43:51] <quuxman> I've been very confused about the inconsistency between <link rel='stylesheet'>/<style>...</style> vs <script src=''.../<script>...</script>
[05:44:00] <Cork> quuxman: also note the comment in the compatibility section
[05:44:12] <Azitrex_> Cork, yes in now i have this trick on my code , thanks
[05:44:28] <Cork> Azitrex_: or you could just move the css out of js :)
[05:44:38] <Cork> (where it shouldn't be anyway)
[05:44:51] <quuxman> Pretty much all of my users use the editing tools in Chrome and FireFox, so it could still be useful
[05:51:04] <quuxman> Azitrex_: use a JavaScript function, or SASS?
[05:51:23] <quuxman> You can do lots of extremely convenient things with a CSS preprocessor
[05:51:48] <quuxman> Like declare variables and functions in your CSS code
[05:51:48] <Cork> quuxman: this is user edited css
[05:51:57] <Cork> meaning it is edited in the browser
[05:52:08] <quuxman> oh, odd, Azitrex_ is dealing with the same sort of thing?
[05:52:42] <Cork> oh lol sorry mixed it up

[06:29:15] <Cork> O_o
[06:29:15] <notchris> Or does anyone use Outlook for work
[06:29:17] <quuxman> I'm OSXing at the moment
[06:29:26] <Cork> notchris: how is this jquery related?

[06:29:43] <quuxman> I'm a lot more familiar with Debian though
[06:29:52] <notchris> Cork: Touche, however, is a question asking the relevance of an irrelevant question relevant to the subject?
[06:30:19] <Cork> notchris: this channel is for jquery questions and jquery development
[06:30:22] <quuxman> There are guts of OSX that are JavaScript.... wasn't that what <canvas> was all about?
[06:30:26] <Cork> notchris: not microsoft product support
[06:30:40] <notchris> Cork: My question wasn’t a support question
[06:31:04] <Cork> then ask the jquery related question so we have something to answer
[06:31:09] <quuxman> Wanting to render some of the shell bits with Safari?
[06:32:09] <Cork> quuxman: i don't think apple was the one pushing canvas
[06:32:53] <Cork> ah, what do you know
[06:32:55] <Cork> it was
[06:43:27] <jop007> I am using json data genereatd on the server like this [{"payment_periodNL":null,"street":null,"place":null,"house_number":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"zip_code":null,"policy_number":"F-2355","expiry_date":null,"effective_date":null,"kvk_number":null,"name_insured":null}]
[06:43:31] <jop007> so far so good
[06:43:43] <jop007> when I parse this data my _ get lost
[06:43:58] <jop007> for instance I got house number and not house_number
[06:44:24] <sacho_> how did you parse your data
[06:45:13] <jop007> I tried it in various format json stringify for example
[06:45:22] <Cork> jop007: as long as the server sends the correct mimetype you don't need to parse the data
[06:45:30] <jop007>       obj = jQuery.parseJSON(data);
[06:45:40] <jop007> is latest trial
[06:45:48] <Cork> just make sure it sends Content-Type: application/json
[06:45:55] <sacho_> okay, and how did you figure that you got "house number" and not "house_number"?
[06:45:56] <jop007> I also tried JSNON in the ajax call
[06:46:02] <jop007> but same results
[06:46:12] <jop007> or more or less the same format
[06:46:24] <jop007> sometimes other fields are missing under scores
[06:46:57] <sacho_> how do you find that out
[06:47:00] <jop007> maybe switch to getjson in stead of $.ajax?
[06:47:22] <Cork> sacho_: looks like he doesn't want to answer you >_>
[06:47:26] <jop007> Cork where to place content type?
[06:47:35] <Cork> jop007: the response header
[06:47:35] <Omar-> jop007 data["name_insured"]
[06:47:54] <jop007> of my php provider you mean
[06:48:18] <Cork> jop007: before you echo the generated json set header
[06:48:23] <Cork> with that string
[06:48:27] <Cork> ?g php header
[06:48:28] <b-ot> Cork: PHP: header - Manual → http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
[06:48:40] <jop007> okay let me try
[06:49:07] <Cork> data should be the parsed json after that
[06:49:25] <Cork> you don't need to manually do that
[06:53:14] <jop007> this is my ajax call   $.ajax({     type: "POST",     url: global.root + "MY_Ezbuild_provider/get_page_data",     dataType: 'JSON',      data: "&pageID=" + pageID,
[06:53:44] <Cork> jop007: dataType just tells the server what data it prefers back
[06:54:00] <Cork> jop007: it is still the server deciding what data it is with the Content-Type header
[06:54:07] <jop007> same result effective_date: nullexpiry_date: nullhouse_number: nullkvk_number: null
[06:54:24] <jop007> euhhh
[06:54:52] <jop007> it looks that chrome debugger won't show them
[06:55:19] <beaconwriter> I've got a strange problem. In chrome only, my dialog box disapears if the zoom is set below 75%
[06:55:39] <beaconwriter> is that a chrome bug?
[06:56:00] <Cork> beaconwriter: or a bug in the code generating the dialog box
[06:56:02] <jop007> I think it is a chrome bug if debugger won't show underscores
[06:58:21] <Cork> jop007: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/nyu57myf/
[06:59:07] <Cork> jop007: so ya, can't reproduce
[07:20:11] <luser> Hi guys. Is there any way to run jquery script that I have locally every time I enter particular domain? I'd like to remove one element from page so it's not visible for me.
[07:20:17] <luser> Something adblock-like I guess.
[07:21:39] <luser> It'd be just something like $('#div').hide() actually.
[07:21:51] <Cork> luser: look at userscript
[07:22:13] <Cork> luser: a simpler solution is to use stylish (exist for both firefox and chrome)
[07:22:21] <Cork> then you can just define extra css rules
[07:22:35] <luser> Cork: Looking good! Thank you a lot!
[07:22:36] <Xatenev> Heya
[07:22:38] <Xatenev> fast question
[07:22:48] <Xatenev> again about the parseerror :p
[07:22:56] <Xatenev> ah nvm
[07:22:57] <Xatenev> solved
[07:23:07] <Xatenev> my brain juts got activated when i started to explain the problem :P
[07:34:16] <walidvb> hey guys
[07:35:11] <walidvb> i'm using $().load('/my-url #foo'), but i'd like it to run the scripts present in #foo
[07:36:27] <Cork> walidvb: it does, but not in the same way it would normally do if it was in the page on page load
[07:36:43] <walidvb> do i need a separate request for that? or should i go with .ajax, rather than .load?
[07:36:53] <Cork> walidvb: so as long as you do element selection and not based on relation to the script tag it should work just fine
[07:37:20] <walidvb> well, right now i have alert() in script tags, within #foo, it's appending #foo.html(), but without the scripts
[07:38:38] <Cork> walidvb: it should work
[07:39:14] <walidvb> hm.
[07:40:11] <walidvb> cause $(foo).html(bar) does run bar's scripts, right?
[07:41:15] <Cork> yup
[07:42:00] <Cork> walidvb: http://jsfiddle.net/jqu1o57a/
[07:42:44] <walidvb> yeah, with html i was pretty sure, but somehow load doesn't do it. i'll try and inspect my response further, or remove the selector
[07:44:05] <walidvb> Cork: nope, even loading the full page(without filtering by selector) doesn't run the scripts(or appends them to the body).. weird
[07:45:02] <walidvb> it's using append, and filtering scripts: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.load
[07:46:56] <walidvb> but apparently only if a selector was given
[07:49:09] <Cork> walidvb: it doesn't filter scripts
[07:49:18] <Cork> walidvb: at lest not the code you linked to
[07:49:44] <Cork> walidvb: i know jquery filters out script tags, but that is cause innerHTML behaves... special with script tags
[07:49:59] <walidvb> yes you're right. funnily enough, other scripts are run(those that are in the header).. Maybe it's because it's missing type="text/javascript"? i thought it was default in HTML5?
[07:50:02] <Cork> walidvb: so for scripts to run as expected they filter them out and execute them "by hand"
[07:50:20] <Cork> walidvb: no it isn't cause of type
[07:50:36] <luser> Cork: Thanks, stylish has done its work properly :)
[07:51:08] <Cork> luser: ya, i use it a lot too
[07:51:20] <Cork> much more then userscripts
[07:51:33] <Cork> even though i use them from time to time too to fix broken pages
[07:51:51] <luser> Yeah, I just had to add display:none to one element on site, but didn't know the tool that will allow me to do it.
[07:51:52] <walidvb> https://gist.github.com/walidvb/4b095b136f86b2111e2c
[07:52:32] <walidvb> Cork: this is my code, and the response(without <head> and all, just the id i filter)
[07:55:54] <walidvb> Cork: btw, jquery doc says they do remove the scripts: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[07:56:12] <walidvb> but executes the,
[07:56:17] <walidvb> them*
[08:00:29] <Peter_Occ> I have some checkboxes which trigger an ajax search. I want to check the boxes automatically and trigger the search. If I run  the triggers from a button click, it works fine. But if I add them to the initial load function, the checkboxes are checked but the triggers don't work. Why?
[08:01:18] <notchris> I’m selecting a few specific tds
[08:01:20] <notchris> http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/visit/movies/
[08:01:30] <notchris> $('table.special tbody > tr:nth-child(n+2) td:nth-child(1)').css('background','green')
[08:01:40] <notchris> Wondering how to get each of those tds into an array
[08:01:45] <Cork> walidvb: heh, that is exactly what i said a while back :)
[08:02:20] <Vimal_> hello does any one know how to figure out jquery ui draggable and droppable on ipad touch events?
[08:02:25] <walidvb> true true. so, it supposedely strips out scripts from the html, appends the html, and eecutes scripts
[08:02:39] <walidvb> somehow in my configuration it doesn't do it.
[08:02:54] <Cork> walidvb: yes, it uses globaExec or something like that
[08:02:56] <walidvb> but finding the scripts and execute them in the callback of load works.
[08:03:07] <Vimal_> I have a website i implemented a shopping cart using jquery draggable and droppable but its not working in ipad and mobile.
[08:03:08] <Cork> walidvb: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.globalEval
[08:03:56] <walidvb> hm yeah i hear and believe you
[08:04:00] <Vimal_> I even tried jquery plugin touch punch but it was failing to recognize mydrag and drop functioanlity
[08:04:18] <walidvb> i read too fast through the docs earlier. but it is the behaviour i expect(and used in the past)
[08:04:28] <walidvb> so not sure what prevents it from working here.
[08:04:36] <Vimal_> Hello any one would like to help me in my mobile touch events on jquery ui drag and droppable?
[08:07:35] <Vimal_> Does any one know how to work with touch events on ipad jquery ui is not working properply
[08:10:19] <m_e> can you do something like this: $(this).each("option:selected", function(i, v) {...
[08:10:35] <Emily_> Hey everyone!
[08:10:51] <coder7of9> i would like my dialog box to return a true or false as follows if(myDialog){//do this}.  however i can only get  the boolean value passed to some method when the button is clicked
[08:11:14] <Emily_> Does any one know how to fix jquery ui draggable and droppable function on ipad and touch devices?
[08:11:30] <coder7of9> emily yes
[08:11:36] <Emily_> Hi coder
[08:11:40] <Emily_> Thanks for reply
[08:11:43] <coder7of9> emily moment
[08:12:10] <Emily_> Coder can i ask you my question?
[08:12:48] <coder7of9> find this library : jquery.ui.touch-punch.min.js
[08:12:53] <coder7of9> Emily find this library : jquery.ui.touch-punch.min.js
[08:12:55] <Emily_> Yeah I did it
[08:13:05] <Emily_> i even included it
[08:13:16] <Emily_>  but it was failed to recognize my touch event
[08:13:33] <Emily_> http://dev.moxie.prospus.com/fill-your-box-2-months/ this is my website. But it is not working. in ipad
[08:14:06] <Emily_> It has two functions bindDrop and unbindDrop
[08:14:33] <Emily_> bindDrop is a function where all the draggable  logic is written
[08:15:28] <coder7of9> Emily I do not have my ipad today so I can only say step through the code and see if something is interferering
[08:15:30] <Emily_> You can simulate ipad on google chrome! and run these functions in google developer console.
[08:15:57] <Emily_> if you have google Chrome! you can simulate Ipad
[08:16:06] <Emily_> it supports touch events
[08:17:13] <coder7of9> it is a small library you shoudl be able to walk through it
[08:17:33] <Emily_> Yeah they told just to include jquery.punch.min
[08:17:39] <coder7of9> for exam pel disable non relevent events
[08:17:48] <Emily_> I did that but it was failing plus no error in console also.
[08:18:23] <coder7of9> does the library support the functionality you desire
[08:18:48] <Emily_> I checked out their demo on their website Yeah they got  that feature
[08:18:51] <Emily_>  which i wanted
[08:18:52] <coder7of9> i was just suggesting the library but i have not used those events
[08:19:22] <Emily_>  Oh okay Coder
[08:20:54] <coder7of9> Emily if the events are supported get a stand alone working example. as a start
[08:21:28] <Emily_> Yeah
[08:22:24] <Emily_> This is what i a trying to figure out why shopping cart not working in ipad
[08:22:35] <Emily_> where as example in touch punch works well.
[08:26:44] <walidvb> Cork: thanks for your help though!

[08:33:26] <BillCriswell> Oh you already did. Well, that's the issue haha.
[08:33:37] <notchris> Hmm
[08:33:39] <brollypop> hi i cant seem to make work sth like $(this).parent().find('.samelevelclass')
[08:33:45] <notchris> Are they not separate values in the array?
[08:33:48] <brollypop> is tehre a problem with using find() after parent() ?
[08:34:06] <BillCriswell> notchris: No sir.
[08:34:21] <notchris> How though...
[08:34:30] <BillCriswell> brollypop: Your code would find .samelevelclass inside of parent.
[08:34:39] <notchris> var obj = $('td[data-id="0"]').text();
[08:34:40] <notchris> var arr = $.makeArray( obj );
[08:34:53] <BillCriswell> notchris: Do you meant to have data-id="0" on all tds?
[08:35:23] <beaconwriter> Cork: based on this https://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-dialog-sometimes-not-showing-in-google-chrome I had to add a height property to the dialog and then it worked...
[08:35:34] <notchris> BillCriswell: Yes because I do
[08:35:59] <notchris>                     foreach ( $tr as $td ) {
[08:35:59] <notchris>                         echo '<td data-id="'. $count++ .'">';
[08:36:01] <notchris>                             echo $td['c'];
[08:36:02] <notchris>                         echo '</td>';
[08:36:02] <notchris>                     }
[08:36:06] <notchris> In PP
[08:36:10] <notchris> Wow, sorry, in PHP
[08:36:26] <notchris> And I know 0 is always the one I want
[08:36:53] <BillCriswell> Your HTML is showing data-id="0" on all of the <td>s though.
[08:37:01] <BillCriswell> not just one of them.
[08:37:14] <notchris> All of the ones that have month names in them
[08:37:15] <notchris> Right?
[08:37:29] <notchris> Yep
[08:38:38] <BillCriswell> notchris: You're really confusing me.
[08:39:22] <notchris> BillCriswell: Check ##frontend for explanation
[08:39:27] <BillCriswell> What are you trying to look for inside of the monthNames array?
[08:39:45] <notchris> I have a table with month names, I want to check if any of those months are equal to the current month
[08:40:43] <BillCriswell> so you're seeing if any of the month names in the tds are the current month?
[08:40:53] <notchris> Yes
[08:42:51] <BillCriswell> I think you're looking for something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/dg33pxcv/3/
[08:43:40] <BillCriswell> notchris: http://jsfiddle.net/dg33pxcv/4/ with clearer variable names, definitely have to work on your variable naming.
[08:44:33] <notchris> Ahh you’re the best1

[08:59:23] <BaNzoun3t> Hey guys, Can I have mutli $('select').on('change') ? and if so is it possible to make sure one is executed before the others?
[08:59:49] <robertmaxrees> multiple handlers on the same element you mean?
[08:59:49] <BaNzoun3t> Currently it looks like the last defined override the others
[08:59:58] <BaNzoun3t> robertmaxrees: yes
[09:00:03] <robertmaxrees> they "stack" - they'll all run.
[09:00:07] <robertmaxrees> but imo relying on that is a bad idea.
[09:00:16] <BaNzoun3t> What would you do?
[09:00:25] <robertmaxrees> define all the logic in one handler.
[09:04:45] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:05:17] <jomofcw> Is tehre any "easy code" to move an element to follow the scroll while it get out of the screen ?
[09:05:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:09:16] <jomofcw> Yea, When I wrote it I think the same "what the fuck it means ?"
[09:09:28] <jomofcw> And I can't find an example of what I wanna do now :/...
[09:09:32] <cjohnson> jomofcw: position: fixed ??
[09:09:36] <robertmaxrees> so try describing it again?
[09:09:51] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you want to set an element to position: fixed; when it leaves the viewport?
[09:10:18] <jomofcw> position fixed is a part of the solution yup. But I want it to be "fixed" just when the user scroll over the top position of the element...
[09:10:25] <jomofcw> Yup !
[09:10:55] <robertmaxrees> there are plugins to handle that.
[09:11:18] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you just figure out where the bottom of the element is in the window and, on scroll, check if you've hit that spot.
[09:11:23] <jomofcw> So I just have to bind the scrollDown event, thene detect when scroll top position is over the element offset top, and change position to "fixed" ?
[09:11:31] <robertmaxrees> *scroll event
[09:11:41] <robertmaxrees> but that's the basic gist.
[09:11:58] <jomofcw> OK. And just to see, do you know any good plugin about that ?
[09:12:18] <robertmaxrees> http://stickyjs.com/
[09:12:23] <robertmaxrees> tons of google results for it.
[09:13:12] <jomofcw> Probably, but as you can see on the top of our conversation, I can't find the right word to search :/.
[09:13:34] <robertmaxrees> "jquery sticky element" is what i searched /shrug
[09:15:08] <jomofcw> OK, I note the "sticky" thing ^^.
[09:15:15] <jomofcw> Thanks for your help =).
[09:15:35] <robertmaxrees> definitely :) good luck!
[09:17:27] <De0Sama> I'm replacing a text box with a drop down if my address lookup brings back more than one result. However, I ultimately don't know whether or not this is the correct address, so I'd like to give my users the ability to go back to typing in a text box
[09:17:48] <De0Sama> I set up some code to check the element jQuery('#streetOption').change(function(){});
[09:17:55] <De0Sama> but it doesn't seem to be triggering...
[09:18:03] <De0Sama> anyone have any idea what i should do?
[09:18:32] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea waht the former and latter have to do with one another :) is #streetOption an element you create?
[09:18:53] <De0Sama> yeah
[09:19:00] <De0Sama> i replace #street with #streetOption
[09:19:08] <robertmaxrees> ah, in that case you need event delegation.
[09:19:16] <robertmaxrees> you can't bind to elements that don't yet exist.
[09:19:16] <De0Sama> becuase I thought that .replaceWith() removes any event triggers from the element
[09:19:24] <De0Sama> hmm
[09:19:25] <samssh> De0Sama, Instead of a dropdown, maybe use an autocomplete-like construct: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[09:19:37] <robertmaxrees> ^ this, too.
[09:20:04] <robertmaxrees> but your current problem is you can't bind to things that don't yet exist.  you'd want to use a delegated listener to fix this.
[09:20:11] <De0Sama> samssh, i'll try that out
[09:20:34] <De0Sama> robertmaxrees, what's a delegated listener?
[09:20:56] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events :)
[09:21:41] <robertmaxrees> long story short, you'd need to make use of the fact that elements bubble up from the original element.  jquery has a really nifty delegated listener system - $('.parent').on('event', '.child', function() {});
[09:22:01] <De0Sama> so
[09:22:03] <De0Sama> i'd do something like
[09:22:25] <De0Sama> jQuery('#street').on('replace', function(){});
[09:22:43] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:22:55] <robertmaxrees> you'd need $('.someParent').on('change', '#street', function() {});
[09:23:07] <De0Sama> ohh
[09:23:07] <De0Sama> i see
[09:23:09] <robertmaxrees> where someParent is an element that exists on pageload.
[09:23:17] <De0Sama> ok
[09:23:22] <robertmaxrees> read the docs i linked - i seems like a lot but it's a pretty quick read.
[09:23:34] <De0Sama> sure thing
[09:36:30] <Omar-> hi
[09:37:48] <arthurvr> Hey Omar-! lol
[09:38:08] <Omar-> hey arthurvr!
[09:38:23] <Omar-> you're like full-moon, we see once in a month :P
[09:38:39] <arthurvr> Haha :D
[09:38:41] <ezek2k4> i'm trying to figure out how i can do this. I have a select field( #country ) and when i change it and with $.getJSON I get the list of cities from another file in json format, i would like to know how i can add an autocomplete to the #cities field from those results
[09:40:06] <Omar-> arthurvr ;)
[09:43:40] <arthurvr> ezek2k4: I’m fiddling something for you :D
[09:49:09] <Synobium_> i have experience of working in android studios, jqury, javascript, sqlite , can i take part in this project..? or do i need to learn something more ...?
[09:49:52] <arthurvr> Synobium_: As I told you before, ask your questions in the appropriate channels.
[09:51:39] <Synobium_> Support chat for users of jQuery, jQuery UI, and jQuery Mobile. Whether you need help, or you want to help others, or both, this is the place to be.So, this isn't it...?
[09:52:30] <arthurvr> Synobium_: You’re interested in the gsoc projects right?
[09:52:36] <Synobium_> ya
[09:52:55] <arthurvr> Well, ask in the channels for jQuery development, not in the support channel.
[09:53:36] <Synobium_> but they aren't replying
[09:53:51] <ryanneufeld> Synobium_: we all have day jobs
[09:54:00] <ryanneufeld> Synobium_: be patient, someone will get back to you
[09:54:06] <Synobium_> ok
[09:54:31] <ryanneufeld> Synobium_: have you seen https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List
[09:54:56] <Synobium_> yes
[09:54:58] <ryanneufeld> Synobium_: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
[09:55:23] <ryanneufeld> Synobium_: "Mentors aren't around 24 hours a day"
[09:56:24] <Synobium_> ok sorry for troubling u and thanks
[09:57:01] <ryanneufeld> Synobium_: The best way to get a jquery devs attention is to pick a bug, fix it, and make a pull request.
[09:57:07] <ryanneufeld> :)
[09:58:20] <arthurvr> ezek2k4: It would probably look like this http://jsbin.com/xobagijome/1/edit?js,output
[09:58:44] <arthurvr> Didn’t have the time to do the json request but guess you can figure that our :D
[09:58:50] <arthurvr> ~out
[09:59:17] <djQuery> anyone familar with jquery mobile know how I can all three on the same line in this example? http://jsbin.com/nidufa/1/edit?html,output
[10:01:09] <Omar-> djQuery
[10:01:25] <djQuery> hey Omar
[10:01:32] <Omar-> wht's the problem?
[10:01:32] <djQuery> how are you doing today?
[10:01:34] <Omar-> hi :)
[10:01:37] <Omar-> good and you?
[10:01:44] <djQuery> lazy
[10:01:57] <djQuery> just trying to remove the breaks between them
[10:02:29] <djQuery> trying to add a button to set a datetime-local field to the current date time without it being on a new line
[10:03:28] <Omar-> djQuery you can use jqm grids
[10:03:46] <Omar-> but I would go for flexbox if you aren't planning to support IE
[10:04:46] <Omar-> djQuery http://jsbin.com/yunuhu/ the 3 checkbox above are aligned using flexbox, open it in your mobile then change orientation to see the difference
[10:05:17] <djQuery> Omar-, would that make all 3 same width?
[10:05:24] <Omar-> yup
[10:05:32] <Omar-> well, you can control the width
[10:06:19] <Omar-> if you want to play around with flexbox http://the-echoplex.net/flexyboxes/
[10:11:39] <Omar-> djQuery http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/pxLyzgwk/ using jQM grids
[10:13:17] <ezek2k4> arthurvr ty, sorry went to bathroom :P
[10:14:55] <ezek2k4> arthurvr thats good only one thing my json data comes from a file res(['City 1', 'City 2', 'City 3']);
[10:15:12] <arthurvr> Yeah. You can just use jQuery.getJSON :D
[10:15:13] <ezek2k4> and i dont know how i can convert it to res so i can use the autocomplete
[10:15:18] <arthurvr> `api jQuery.getJSON
[10:15:18] <b-ot> arthurvr: jQuery.getJSON(): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[10:15:36] <arthurvr> Convert it to an array using whatever technique you like
[10:15:47] <ezek2k4> okk
[10:16:26] <ezek2k4> ill try that tyvm
[10:16:51] <djQuery> Omar-, but I have to switch to flexgrids to get different widths right?
[10:17:22] <Omar-> djQuery you can adjust width in both
[10:17:53] <Omar-> but the issue about jQM grids is that they break on small screens
[10:18:15] <Omar-> so you need to define a breakpoint to control them
[10:18:46] <Omar-> divs will wrap to next line
[10:18:58] <Omar-> unline flexbox, they dont wrap
[10:19:42] <Omar-> but you also need media queries to control elements width in small screens
[10:28:08] <pilotbob> Hi all
[10:28:28] <pilotbob> Strange issue, our document ready functions are begin called multiple times. Any ideas of what to look for?
[10:31:20] <Omar-> pilotbob can show us some of your code?
[10:31:43] <robertmaxrees> pilotbob invalid HTML.
[10:33:14] <pilotbob> Omar-: no, it's not public
[10:33:31] <pilotbob> robertmaxrees: why type of invalid html?
[10:33:36] <robertmaxrees> Any.
[10:33:50] <robertmaxrees> unclosed tags, malformed stuff,
[10:33:56] <robertmaxrees> missing body tags, etc.
[10:34:29] <decx> Omar- how is your project coming along?
[10:38:00] <pilotbob> robertmaxrees: ok, I'll check out the view source and see if I see anything. thanks.
[10:38:08] <robertmaxrees> use a validator.
[10:38:39] <pilotbob> robertmaxrees: that's hard to do with so much sever rendered html. Any tips?
[10:38:50] <Omar-> hi decx, almost done. http://jsbin.com/yunuhu/
[10:38:56] <robertmaxrees> copy the rendered page source and use the w3c validator?
[10:39:09] <Omar-> just need to add some details to viewer page.

[10:43:49] <Omar-> :P
[10:43:53] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:43:57] <robertmaxrees> too much stuff going on lately.
[10:44:07] <Omar-> well, this is life
[10:44:48] <robertmaxrees> eh, kind of an exceptional circumstance right now, but meh.
[10:53:14] <litropy> $("#myDivWithChildren") returns what it should. However, $("#myDivWithChildren:nth-child(3)") returns [] instead of the third child element. Any help with syntax?
[10:54:34] <robertmaxrees> how many direct descendents are there of the div?
[10:54:40] <robertmaxrees> not total children.
[10:55:46] <samssh> litropy, I'm going to hazard a guess that $("#myDivWithChildren :nth-child(3)") is what you want.
[10:55:53] <robertmaxrees> oh that too haha

[11:04:53] <negusnegesti> Hi guys!
[11:04:53] <negusnegesti> I already asked several times about ajax and throbber... today I'd like to rewrite my question.
[11:04:53] <negusnegesti> I am using async: false and this freezes the browser (MS IE, chrome, opera, ... but firefox)
[11:04:53] <negusnegesti> I could use "success" and continue with my code. Unfortunately, I have so many ajax request that it isn't possible.
[11:04:53] <negusnegesti> Did you ever encounter this problem? If yes, how did you solve it?
[11:04:53] <negusnegesti> If no, do you have any ideas how to handle this issue?
[11:04:53] <negusnegesti> Thx in advance!
[11:05:02] <robertmaxrees> woah 'sup spam
[11:05:18] <robertmaxrees> what problem are you trying to solve?
[11:06:13] <negusnegesti> I am using a throbber (gif) but it stopps "running" because the browser freezes ... I'd like to have it running using async: false
[11:06:21] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[11:06:32] <robertmaxrees> async: false will cause the browser to freeze.  that's why you don't use it.
[11:06:48] <robertmaxrees> do you have multiple ajax requests that need to finish before you remove it?
[11:08:18] <negusnegesti> ok, is there a way to prevent the computer from executing the code for a certain time?
[11:08:35] <Omar-> bye everyone!
[11:08:44] <robertmaxrees> negusnegesti yes, but that's code smell.
[11:08:50] <robertmaxrees> are you waiting for multiple ajax requests to finish?
[11:09:02] <negusnegesti> yes
[11:09:07] <robertmaxrees> then use deferreds.
[11:09:40] <robertmaxrees> var ajax1 = $.ajax(), ajax2 = $.ajax();  $.when(ajax1, ajax2).done(function() { $('.loading').hide(); });
[11:10:25] <negusnegesti> this is the first time i am hearing about it :)
[11:10:49] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly the kind of case deferreds are great for.
[11:14:43] <negusnegesti> Thx dude, I will give it a try :)
[11:25:08] <negusnegesti> robertmaxrees: Doesn't work the way we need it :(
[11:25:29] <negusnegesti> i need to wait for the information but the code still proceeds
[11:25:38] <negusnegesti> another solution, maybe?
[11:27:16] <wizbit> How can i uncheck a checkbox? This is what I have so far but it doesnt work:
[11:27:18] <wizbit> $('input[name="form-subscribe"]').val('');
[11:27:35] <robertmaxrees> then you're using it wrong.
[11:27:38] <robertmaxrees> negusnegesti
[11:27:47] <robertmaxrees> wizbit .prop('checked', false)
[11:27:52] <robertmaxrees> insteadof using .val()
[11:27:58] <wizbit> ace, will test :D
[11:28:08] <robertmaxrees> negusnegesti can you share a fiddle of your code?
[11:28:43] <wizbit> works perfectly!!! THANK YOU!
[11:28:47] <robertmaxrees> wizbit deffo.
[11:29:18] <negusnegesti> robert: can't I use it this way:  var ajax1 ... do the request and directly after the request use $.when in order to stop the code till we have the needed information??
[11:29:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:29:42] <robertmaxrees> you're making this WAY too complicated.
[11:30:02] <robertmaxrees> no "stopping" - you need to learn about callbacks and deferreds.
[11:30:17] <negusnegesti> the thing is, I need to wait for that information in order to start the next ajax request
[11:30:30] <robertmaxrees> so then you use .done()
[11:30:38] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done(function() {$.ajax()})
[11:31:56] <negusnegesti> I already tried this... I then will have too many nested requests... cannot access the needed value outside that done-part
[11:32:06] <robertmaxrees> then you're nesting things wrong.
[11:33:10] <robertmaxrees> i have to go to lunch.
[11:33:17] <robertmaxrees> but share your code if you can.
[11:38:21] <samssh> negusnegesti, Defined the callback function for the nested ajax to be a function you declare in the scope you need it in.
[11:42:09] <samssh> negusnegesti, Have a look at this: http://jsbin.com/sovemaqisu/1/edit
[11:48:43] <ZoffixWork> Hey. For some reason my .done() on object returned by .ajax() calls the function right away, instead of waiting for the request to complete. Here's the code: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/470269
[11:49:48] <ZoffixWork> And it's actually due to the closure... I can't figure out how I can pass some variables into the function that will be called when my request is done :/
[11:53:42] <ZoffixWork> Ah. I just suck at JS :) Never mind me. I can access variable just fine without the "nested" closure ~_~
[12:09:12] <grill> yo. how exactly would I create a click event for some content (a few trs) that do not exist on $(document).ready?
[12:20:30] <decx> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:20:42] <cranderson> grill: are you talking about content introduced to dom by ajax?
[12:21:14] <grill> cranderson i got it. event delegation's what i need
[12:21:17] <cranderson> if so, you're looking for .on('#elem','click',function(e){});
[12:47:39] <robertmaxrees> flip the event and selector
[12:47:48] <robertmaxrees> .on('click','#elem',function(){});
[13:09:30] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day
[13:17:51] <decx> and happy heckuva day to you too
[13:18:02] <decx> that's a jewish holiday no?

[13:24:19] <Symes_Web> Hi
[13:24:59] <ryanneufeld> o/ Symes_Web
[13:25:32] <Symes_Web> I need a little help on some jQuery
[13:25:47] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @ Symes_Web
[13:25:47] <b-ot> Symes_Web: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:26:56] <Symes_Web> Well some of my code goes as so: this.container.animate(this.startPosition, 400);
[13:27:05] <Symes_Web> And the startPosition is a prototype
[13:27:27] <Symes_Web> But I don't know how to assign the following
[13:27:36] <Symes_Web> Morphing.prototype.endPosition = function( top ) {
[13:27:36] <Symes_Web> 	top = top;
[13:27:36] <Symes_Web> 	left = '50%';
[13:27:38] <Symes_Web> 	width = 600;
[13:27:40] <Symes_Web> 	height = 400;
[13:27:42] <Symes_Web> 	marginLeft = -300;
[13:27:44] <Symes_Web> };
[13:27:45] <ryanneufeld> ?paste @Symes_Web
[13:27:45] <b-ot> Symes_Web: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[13:31:12] <Symes_Web> Lines 48-62
[13:31:17] <Symes_Web> How do I do that correctly?
[13:31:51] <ryanneufeld> line 49 is pointless
[13:32:05] <ryanneufeld> lines 57 to 61 can be done with one call to .css

[13:32:45] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: http://api.jquery.com/css/#css-properties you can pass in an object to .css
[13:33:09] <Symes_Web> So how would I do it in my case?
[13:33:29] <ryanneufeld> I'm assuming you know the generic object syntax
[13:33:45] <Symes_Web> Yes
[13:33:48] <ryanneufeld> you're modifying a prototype so I'm assuming you have some advanced knowledge her
[13:34:02] <ryanneufeld> so, you pass in an object that has key value pairs matching what you want set
[13:34:21] <ryanneufeld> oh, wait, you're getting the values, not setting them there
[13:34:22] <ryanneufeld> my bad
[13:34:37] <Symes_Web> Well the first one im setting
[13:34:40] <Symes_Web> second is getting
[13:34:41] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:34:43] <t4nk903> Hi, Jquery validation returns undefined on me.. I have a jsfiddle here, but I cannot find the issue.. Is anyone able to find out what is the bottleneck?
[13:34:51] <t4nk903> http://jsfiddle.net/kzwqLhcy/

[13:36:04] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: uh huh
[13:36:18] <Symes_Web> So im trying to animate according the those values
[13:36:26] <ryanneufeld> you understand that just defining values in function scope doesn't actually return them right?
[13:36:36] <decx> why are you doing all that code when you know the endposition?
[13:36:48] <decx> seems to be a lot of stuff that could be done with one addClass
[13:36:54] <ryanneufeld> Agreed
[13:37:00] <ryanneufeld> but if he's trying to animate it
[13:37:05] <Symes_Web> How do I do an animate on an addclass?
[13:37:07] <Symes_Web> ^^
[13:37:13] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: css transforms

[13:38:11] <decx> it's all connected bro ^^
[13:38:12] <Symes_Web> So id like to do it with animate
[13:38:37] <t4nk903> ryanneufeld: How do you mean ?
[13:38:48] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: then modify lines 48-62 to be a simple object, and return that
[13:39:01] <ryanneufeld> I'm not a pro with animate, but I think that might do it
[13:39:09] <ryanneufeld> t4nk903: why do you have that on your form?
[13:39:58] <t4nk903> apparently jquery validation does that by itself to disable build-in HTML5 validation
[13:40:36] <ryanneufeld> t4nk903: $().ready(function () { is wrong
[13:40:44] <ryanneufeld> $(function () {
[13:40:49] <ryanneufeld> is likely what you wanted there
[13:41:04] <robertmaxrees> ryanneufeld https://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:41:08] <robertmaxrees> you can do $().ready()
[13:41:16] <ryanneufeld> robertmaxrees: well, that's new to me :p
[13:41:22] <robertmaxrees> wouldn't ever actually do it, but the docs even say you can.
[13:41:25] <robertmaxrees> it's gross imo.
[13:41:26] <ryanneufeld> I haven't done jquery in a year
[13:41:53] <t4nk903> i changed it to $( document ).ready(function() {
[13:42:01] <t4nk903> but still getting the undefined error :(
[13:42:38] <t4nk903> http://jsfiddle.net/kzwqLhcy/1/ >> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[13:43:09] <ryanneufeld> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined

[13:43:58] <decx> $().ready() defaults the document selector?
[13:44:48] <t4nk903> I added this function, but still an error.. http://jsfiddle.net/kzwqLhcy/2/
[13:45:58] <t4nk903> it keeps returning undefined, and idk why :/
[13:46:13] <ryanneufeld> t4nk903: for starters
[13:46:13] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/kzwqLhcy/3/
[13:46:18] <ryanneufeld> use a submit button
[13:46:31] <ryanneufeld> and you'll get the debug output that Jorn put in there
[13:47:12] <ryanneufeld> $(...).optional is not a function
[13:47:42] <ryanneufeld> t4nk903: http://jsfiddle.net/kzwqLhcy/4/ this.optional
[13:47:48] <ryanneufeld> not $(this).optional
[13:48:30] <t4nk903> Ahh thanks a ton! but it still returns undefined, the last link you sent :(
[13:49:08] <t4nk903> for me - at least
[13:49:57] <ryanneufeld> I'm not getting that
[13:50:14] <t4nk903> huh
[13:50:20] <t4nk903> jsfiddle reports this to me
[13:50:38] <t4nk903> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[13:50:56] <ryanneufeld> /onfocusout: true,
[13:50:59] <ryanneufeld>  //onfocusout: true,
[13:52:03] <t4nk903> Hmm, why is that the bottleneck? it should validate its inputs onfocusout :<
[13:53:15] <ryanneufeld> A boolean true is not a valid value.
[13:53:27] <ryanneufeld> Read the docs
[13:53:33] <ryanneufeld> onfocusout is not a boolean flag
[13:53:35] <ryanneufeld> it's a callback
[13:54:18] * ryanneufeld 's work here is done
[13:54:51] <t4nk903> ohh how stupid of me.. fuck me..
[13:55:00] <ryanneufeld> It does it on focus out automatically :p
[13:55:01] <t4nk903> Thanks alot. you're been a great help to me :)
[13:55:06] <ryanneufeld> Np
[13:55:07] <t4nk903> you've*
[13:55:08] <ryanneufeld> glad to help
[13:55:18] <AssassinsMod> i was wondering if `$("div").remove()` and `$("div").each(.. $(this).remove() ..)` do the same thing..
[13:55:25] <ryanneufeld> (we've all been there btw t4nk903)
[13:55:39] <ryanneufeld> ?tryit @ AssassinsMod
[13:55:51] <ryanneufeld> ?uptime
[13:55:51] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: Sober for 1w 30m 55s.
[13:56:11] <decx> AssassinsMod:  http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.remove
[13:56:12] <AssassinsMod> ryanneufeld: you're right tho, maybe i'm a bit drunk or something
[13:57:08] <AssassinsMod> decx: isn't jquery's last version 2.1.3?
[13:57:34] <decx> well you can change it in the select, i doubt anything changed
[13:57:49] <decx> it's got a for loop so there's that
[13:58:25] <AssassinsMod> decx: thanks for the resource anyway, i had no idea something like this existsd
[13:58:40] <decx> yeah it's pretty neat not having to dig through git
[13:59:12] <AssassinsMod> definitely
[13:59:31] <decx> *search git, 5 pages of tests*
[14:00:17] <ryanneufeld> AssassinsMod: so, one of the core things about how jquery works is the selector engine
[14:00:59] <AssassinsMod> ryanneufeld: I'm at a pretty low level
[14:01:47] <ryanneufeld> pretty much everything in $.fn expects to operate on a collection of elements
[14:02:30] <ryanneufeld> $() is an array-like object, as typically (unless you're using ID selectors) you get more than one element back from your selection
[14:02:44] <decx> usually they have their own .each inside, surprising that remove doesnt
[14:02:58] <AssassinsMod> in old versions it doesn't
[14:03:14] <AssassinsMod> i'll test
[14:03:32] <ryanneufeld> decx: it has a for loop to iterate over the collection
[14:03:43] <ryanneufeld> so n=1 is operated on the same as n=M
[14:03:48] <ryanneufeld> https://www.youtube.com/user/jquery/videos AssassinsMod
[14:03:52] <Alphos> hiya people. trying to wrap my head around jqXHR objects, mostly about the "deferred" part. if i need the content of an http request for the next part of my script, do i have to place it inside the .then() callback, or is there a way to pass it to the calling scope ?
[14:03:53] <decx> well yeah but oftentimes it's return this.each
[14:04:10] <decx> was surprising how often each is used internally
[14:04:24] <ryanneufeld> decx: yeah, i'm not sure why it's different in some places
[14:04:28] <AssassinsMod> thanks ryanneufeld
[14:04:33] <decx> many people working on it probably ;)
[14:04:34] <ryanneufeld> I think core functions don't call each
[14:04:45] <Symes_Web> ryanneufeld
[14:04:46] <ryanneufeld> Yeah we have lots of people working on the code
[14:04:55] <ryanneufeld> and there have been many, many changes
[14:04:56] <Symes_Web> Done what you said and changed to a normal object
[14:04:59] <Symes_Web> https://jsfiddle.net/f793yvh5/6/
[14:05:18] <Symes_Web> [Error] TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Morphing.container.css')
[14:05:18] <Symes_Web> 	(anonymous function) (newScript.js, line 62)
[14:05:33] <AssassinsMod> Alphos: can't you just say .done( callback )?
[14:05:39] <Symes_Web> Thats only error, because im calling it wrong, but not sure how to fix
[14:06:07] <ryanneufeld> Uncaught ReferenceError: Morphing is not defined
[14:06:17] <Alphos> AssassinsMod not sure i fully get the diff between .done and .then
[14:06:40] <Symes_Web> Pretty sure it is though :/
[14:06:47] <AssassinsMod> Alphos: .then( success, error ), .done( success )
[14:07:18] <Alphos> AssassinsMod ok, but the problem/question remains the same, the remainder of the code does have to be placed inside the callback, doesn't it ?
[14:07:42] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: you have scope resolution issues here
[14:08:10] <AssassinsMod> Alphos: y
[14:08:31] <Alphos> ok then, thanks
[14:08:35] <AssassinsMod> Alphos: if you have to manage the data you retrieve from something like a $.get you can do that only in the callback
[14:08:36] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: https://jsfiddle.net/f793yvh5/7/ for testing you want all your JS on the js box below
[14:09:11] <Symes_Web> Sorry
[14:09:15] <ryanneufeld> looking at line 60->65 how will it know what Morphing.container is when it hasn't been instantiated yet?
[14:09:36] <Symes_Web> But it's below the Morphing function
[14:09:38] <Alphos> AssassinsMod : i've tried pushing it from the callback to the calling scope with var foo; $.get().then(function(value) { foo = value; } );// but it doesn't seem to work the way i expect ^^'
[14:09:40] <Symes_Web> So surely it has
[14:09:46] <ryanneufeld> not it hasn't
[14:09:56] <AssassinsMod> Alphos: it doesn't work like that in fact C:
[14:10:01] <ryanneufeld> cause you haven't called Morphing() yet Symes_Web
[14:10:49] <Alphos> AssassinsMod : pity, i would have LOVED avoiding additional indentation ^^'
[14:10:58] <Symes_Web> Can i just call it before the object then?
[14:11:16] <AssassinsMod> Alphos: i should understand what you're trying to do to be albe to help
[14:11:24] <AssassinsMod> Alphos: i'm a bit bad with english tho
[14:11:46] <momomo> I think i found a bug in jquery
[14:12:01] <momomo> it is the form.serialize()
[14:12:05] <Alphos> AssassinsMod : passing several calls to an api, where each call depends on the result (the http content, in other words) of the previous one
[14:12:09] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: no
[14:12:24] <AssassinsMod> Alphos: yeah, i had to do the same thing, it's a pain in the ass
[14:12:42] <AssassinsMod> Alphos: basically the way you wrote it would work in sync mode, but that would freeze the page
[14:13:08] <Symes_Web> So what would be the solution?
[14:13:09] <momomo> should it be appending + everywhere?
[14:13:26] <momomo> for spaces
[14:13:58] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: https://jsfiddle.net/f793yvh5/9/
[14:14:02] <ryanneufeld> That
[14:14:04] <ryanneufeld> is one way
[14:14:17] <ryanneufeld> I just moved your positions in to your constructor function
[14:14:18] <Alphos> AssassinsMod wow, it's really been a while since i've toyed with anything JS-y. forgot it wasn't sync by default >_<
[14:14:41] <ryanneufeld> Alphos: sync will be disabled on newer jquery soon if it hasn't already
[14:15:24] <Symes_Web> I See
[14:16:03] <Alphos> ryanneufeld oh boy :-(
[14:16:22] <ryanneufeld> Alphos: Why would you want a syncronous ajax request?
[14:16:33] <Alphos> ryanneufeld because i'm indent-lazy ^^'
[14:16:52] <ryanneufeld> what does indentation have to do with it?
[14:17:30] <Symes_Web> self is not defined.
[14:17:35] <ryanneufeld> yes it is
[14:17:36] <Symes_Web> Should it be var self = this;
[14:17:44] <momomo> why are spaces turned into +++++++++++ for form.serialize()
[14:17:53] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: yes, it should, but it is defined
[14:17:57] <momomo> I am sending it to the server, how can I send the proper format?
[14:17:59] <ryanneufeld> I defined it when I wrote self = this
[14:18:06] <Symes_Web> But I get the error
[14:18:09] <Symes_Web> self is not defined
[14:18:10] <ryanneufeld> I just accidentally made it a global
[14:18:15] <ryanneufeld> what browser are you using?
[14:18:30] <ryanneufeld> and you're seeing that on the fiddle?
[14:18:30] <Symes_Web> Well that is what JSHint says
[14:18:38] <Symes_Web> Not the console
[14:18:55] <ryanneufeld> you didn't say you were using jshint
[14:19:01] <ryanneufeld> I just accidentally made it a global
[14:19:04] <ryanneufeld> that's all
[14:19:07] <ryanneufeld> it's valid js
[14:19:08] <Symes_Web> Lol sorry got it
[14:19:14] <Symes_Web> Im new to JS
[14:19:17] <ryanneufeld> I just forgot the var
[14:19:20] <Symes_Web> Is JSHint good?
[14:19:24] <ryanneufeld> well, it's good you're using jshint
[14:19:30] <ryanneufeld> yes, it is
[14:19:32] <ryanneufeld> jquery uses it
[14:19:51] <momomo> anyone??
[14:19:57] <Symes_Web> If I didn't make use the var, couldn't I get rid of all my other var self = this; 's
[14:20:10] <kevireilly> momomo: should be able to parse it back into the proper format once received
[14:20:54] <momomo> kevireilly, do I need to?
[14:21:07] <momomo> shouldn't I be able to recieve it as is?
[14:21:25] <momomo> i don't want to special treat it, it's the first time I've ever encountered this
[14:21:26] <ryanneufeld> momomo: that's how http serialization works
[14:21:38] <ryanneufeld> it's part of the http spec
[14:22:10] <momomo> ryanneufeld, but when I submit the form without ajax .. you mean I will get the pluses as well ?
[14:22:22] <ryanneufeld> have you tried it?
[14:22:33] <momomo> one moment
[14:22:36] <ryanneufeld> whatever your end point is, will likely have to decode it
[14:22:50] <ryanneufeld> if it doesn't do so transparently
[14:26:31] <momomo> ryanneufeld, yes, now i've tried
[14:26:32] <momomo> it
[14:26:56] <momomo> and the answer is no.. there are no plusses but spaces
[14:27:10] <momomo> so jquery is fucked up
[14:27:14] <ryanneufeld> no
[14:27:21] <momomo> i need to write my own serialization now
[14:27:25] <ryanneufeld> no you dont
[14:27:32] <ryanneufeld> what's your back end written in
[14:27:32] <momomo> why the difference?
[14:27:35] <momomo> java
[14:27:54] <ryanneufeld> what's your back end written in
[14:27:56] <ryanneufeld> String result = java.net.URLDecoder.decode(url, "UTF-8");
[14:28:16] <ryanneufeld> Litterally the FIRST result from this search https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=java%20url%20decode
[14:28:26] <ryanneufeld> Don't blame jquery because you don't understand HTTP
[14:28:57] <ryanneufeld> Also, I'm sorry you have to build whatever it is in java
[14:29:06] <Symes_Web> Does this work in your JSfiddle?
[14:29:07] <Symes_Web> https://jsfiddle.net/f793yvh5/18/
[14:29:16] <Symes_Web> As in the morphing button concept
[14:29:37] <ryanneufeld> The one I gave you was
[14:29:39] <ryanneufeld> this one is not
[14:29:56] <momomo> ryanneufeld, if I am submitting it as json .. then I would have to go in and deserilizase json key values
[14:29:58] <momomo> right/
[14:29:59] <momomo> ?
[14:30:05] <Symes_Web> I dont know why because it works in my browser
[14:30:13] <Symes_Web> Fiddle just doesnt work :/
[14:30:18] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @momomo
[14:30:18] <b-ot> momomo: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:32:31] <Symes_Web> Ah figured it
[14:32:33] <Symes_Web> https://jsfiddle.net/f793yvh5/22/
[14:32:44] <Symes_Web> Okay all works well, except, if you open and close it about 4-5 times
[14:32:53] <Symes_Web> It messes up... seems quite severe too
[14:33:51] <momomo> ryanneufeld, it's not that easy.. how can I decode it on the client side? decodeURIComponent(serialized) doesn't seem to work
[14:34:16] <ryanneufeld> why are you serialzing it at all?
[14:34:34] <ryanneufeld> I have no context for what you're doing here, it's hard to help you
[14:34:56] <Symes_Web> Any insight on my issue ryan?
[14:35:17] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: sorry man, on your own now
[14:35:46] <Symes_Web> I don't understand how such a big mess up can come from such simple code
[14:35:52] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: all I can say is that your code is incredibly complex when it doesn't need to be
[14:36:03] <Symes_Web> Oh
[14:36:04] <tasaif> Symes_Web: rm -rf /
[14:36:21] <ryanneufeld> tasaif: don't be a troll
[14:36:33] <tasaif> ryanneufeld: "I don't understand how such a big mess up can come from such simple code
[14:36:33] <tasaif> "
[14:36:48] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: have you noticed the extra blue box beside your original terms & conds
[14:37:01] <ryanneufeld> tasaif: congrats, you can copy and paste, I can read
[14:37:11] <Symes_Web> Yeah
[14:37:17] <Symes_Web> Thats the bit that morphs out
[14:37:18] <ryanneufeld> well, what's that about?
[14:37:20] <ryanneufeld> https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3mlfa80d2yeqvi/Screenshot%202015-03-25%2014.37.11.png?dl=0
[14:37:23] <Symes_Web> Once the button fades away
[14:37:24] <tasaif> then you see the connection and the lack of trolling
[14:38:01] <ryanneufeld> tasaif: telling someone to delete the contents of their hard drive is not only not helpful, but a total asshole move
[14:38:01] <Symes_Web> Basically: button fades, container same size as the button pops out, overlay and content fade in
[14:38:06] <ryanneufeld> and therefore is trolling
[14:38:13] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: k
[14:38:16] <tasaif> http://facepalm.jpg.to
[14:39:01] <Symes_Web> Lol off to stack overflow:P
[14:39:24] <momomo> ryanneufeld, here is a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3777d03n/
[14:39:43] <momomo> I need to read the serialized content on the client side, please don't ask why
[14:39:45] <momomo> :p
[14:39:50] <momomo> it's hard to explain
[14:40:57] <ryanneufeld> then don't serialize it
[14:41:04] <momomo> ryanneufeld, i need to
[14:41:16] <momomo> it has to go through a url parser
[14:41:23] <momomo> to build something else out of it
[14:41:32] <momomo> that part is already written
[14:41:38] <momomo> and I just need to use that api
[14:41:40] <ryanneufeld> okay
[14:42:02] <ryanneufeld> so you don't like that it does safe url encoding when serializing, but you don't want it to do that cause you don't like it...
[14:42:09] <ryanneufeld> I'm confused, and give up
[14:42:49] <momomo> but why am I not able to decode it?
[14:42:56] <momomo> using decodeURIComponenet
[14:43:05] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: your morphContainer isn't getting display none set when you've closed it
[14:43:11] <ryanneufeld> ?mdn decodeURIComponenet
[14:43:12] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: decodeURIComponent() - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent
[14:43:43] <ryanneufeld> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent
[14:43:48] <ryanneufeld> you should be able to
[14:43:52] <ryanneufeld> why you are not, I am not sure
[14:44:10] <momomo> did you see the fiddle?
[14:44:23] <ryanneufeld> looking now
[14:44:30] <momomo> http://jsfiddle.net/3777d03n/1/
[14:45:20] <Symes_Web> Thats because it's always meant to be visible, it's just covered by the button when not on screen
[14:46:14] <momomo> Symes_Web, talkin' to me?
[14:46:21] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: just hide it
[14:46:27] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: it's cleaner that way
[14:46:34] <ryanneufeld> momomo: he was talking at me
[14:46:35] <ryanneufeld> momomo: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/
[14:46:37] <ryanneufeld> that may help you
[14:47:27] <Velveeta> that deocdeURIComponent call isn't working because that's not an encodedURIComponent
[14:47:57] <ryanneufeld> sorry guys, I gotta bounce and give my day-job some attention
[14:48:08] <Velveeta> ryanneufeld: don't you just hate that?
[14:48:19] <ryanneufeld> Velveeta: nah, I get paid pretty well :p
[14:48:26] <ryanneufeld> what I do here is for fun
[14:48:31] <Velveeta> same here ;)
[14:48:54] <Symes_Web> Okay well even with that, the wierd mess up still occurs after 4 clicks
[14:48:55] <momomo> Velveeta, it takes a String
[14:49:18] <Velveeta> right, but it's expecting to find encoded characters like %2D, etc
[14:49:30] <Velveeta> that string doesn't have anything like that for it to decode, so you get back the original string
[14:50:41] <momomo> Velveeta, but is jquery outputting something that is not standard?
[14:50:55] <momomo> and if so, there has to be a way to go back
[14:51:53] <Velveeta> probably, but you'd have to investigate the serialize function to figure out why it's outputting plusses for spaces
[14:53:01] <momomo> Velveeta, when I submit the form without jquery, the url becomes: http://localhost:8080/server/finance/home/stockscreener?json=+++++++++++++a+++++++++++++++++
[14:53:07] <momomo> so it's not just jquery
[14:53:13] <momomo> but why am I unable to go back?
[14:53:24] <momomo> i should be able to decode that
[14:53:45] <ryanneufeld> because that string is meant to be decoded by a browser in a url or a post
[14:54:27] <momomo> I am not sure what that means: decodeURI(location.search) .. didn't work
[14:54:46] <ryanneufeld> momomo: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[14:54:51] <ryanneufeld> maybe that will be more useful for you?
[14:55:35] <t4nk903> Any way to prevent keyup being fired upon replace ?
[14:55:45] <ryanneufeld> as it stands right now, it seems that you're either going to have to write a replacement function (which could be troublesome if your input has a + in it )
[14:55:51] <ryanneufeld> momomo: ^^
[14:56:03] <ryanneufeld> t4nk903: don't use onkeyup
[14:56:16] <t4nk903> Which one is preferred then ?
[14:56:25] <ryanneufeld> just let it happen on submit
[14:56:35] <ryanneufeld> it won't let the form submit if it fails validation
[14:56:43] <momomo> ryanneufeld, yes, serializeArray might be better and walk through it myself
[14:56:52] <t4nk903> okay - thanks :) will try
[14:59:23] <phasespace> is there a way to express "if not current value do something" in js?
[14:59:48] <DragonPunch> wth is curr val?
[15:00:26] <DragonPunch> phasespace; i know you can use this. but that just clears scopes .
[15:01:09] <DragonPunch> if (!x) == null or undefined
[15:01:21] <phasespace> if this is not this anymore do something
[15:01:30] <DragonPunch> if (x != oldval) {..]
[15:01:42] <DragonPunch> if (x != oldval) {....}
[15:02:59] <chillsurf> is it possible to scroll the page after visited from my subpage of same site?
[15:03:35] <user_corrupt> I'm trying to assign a PHP value to a JS variable. Here is my line of code (that is failing): http://pastie.org/10053646
[15:04:02] <jumpman> I'm encountering a really bizarre problem: I'm including a WordPress plugin which creates a jQuery plugin 'tpessential()' via jQuery.extend. It's being included in the page but later in the page within a document.ready block, the plugin is undefined
[15:04:19] <jumpman> The code that defines it is *definitely* being included and it's *definitely* not producing an error
[15:04:48] <jumpman> http://petcha.com/pet_care/breeds/ <-- Here's the live page so you can see the error for yourself
[15:05:19] <jumpman> http://petcha.com/pet_care/wp-content/plugins/essential-grid/public/assets/js/jquery.themepunch.essential.js <-- This is the file in which it is defined, you can see that by searching 'tpessential'
[15:05:46] <jumpman> http://petcha.com/pet_care/wp-content/plugins/essential-grid/public/assets/js/jquery.themepunch.essential.min.js <-- The minified version is actually appearing on the page
[15:06:18] <rubyonrailed> I'm appending a table row to my view, but after I append it, it doesn't show up in the source but shows on the view.  How can I still use those elements that get appended?
[15:06:43] <jumpman> my team is all-hands-on-deck trying to troubleshoot this error and we - each seasoned web devs aside from myself - can't find anything that could cause it
[15:07:29] <rubyonrailed> But I can see the elements if I inspect info
[15:08:45] <ryanneufeld> jumpman: which jquery is it using? the one shipped w/ wordpress ? or did you add your own
[15:09:53] <jumpman> let me check really quickly
[15:10:37] <jumpman> It appears that we're using the WordPress jquery
[15:10:45] <jumpman> I notice that in two places we have called jquery.noConflict()
[15:10:50] <ryanneufeld> <script type='text/javascript' src='http://petcha.com/pet_care/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.11.1'></script>
[15:10:50] <ryanneufeld> <script type='text/javascript' src='http://petcha.com/pet_care/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery-migrate.min.js?ver=1.2.1'></script>
[15:11:01] <jumpman> However, neither in the definition of the plugin or its use are we doing $()
[15:11:13] <ryanneufeld> you guys have a shit load of js on that page
[15:11:23] <jumpman> yeah, way too much. it's not my page, i promise :p
[15:11:27] <richie> I'm trying to use console in inspect element on chrome to determine an error, but it's a pop up with an error message box that every time I click "X" it closes the popup. What is an alternative method than using inspect element?
[15:11:32] <jumpman> most of the js is included via PHP, too.
[15:11:33] <ryanneufeld> <script type='text/javascript' src='http://petcha.com/pet_care/wp-content/plugins/brightcove-video-cloud/jquery.min.js?ver=4.1.1'></script>
[15:11:36] <ryanneufeld> what is that?
[15:11:41] <jumpman> AHHHHH
[15:11:44] <jumpman> that's the problem is what it is
[15:11:58] <ryanneufeld> you're including more than one copy of jquery
[15:16:40] <jumpman> ryanneufeld++
[15:16:49] <ryanneufeld> was that the problem?
[15:17:51] <jumpman> almost certainly - but someone said they made changes at the same time as we disabled brightcove - we're in the process of re-confirming
[15:18:10] <jumpman> but i'm very close to certain it is. the page I found initially has the same answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14483557/jquery-plugins-not-working-type-error-undefined-is-not-a-function
[15:18:51] <momomo> ryanneufeld, appearantly one need to replace the + manually
[15:19:01] <momomo> decodeURIComponent( jQuery('form').serialize().replace(/\+/g, " ") ) ...
[15:19:18] <momomo> works, I don't think anythin else needs to be replaced
[15:19:20] <momomo> I hope;
[15:21:27] <ryanneufeld> momomo: the only problem with that is if your input has + in it
[15:21:46] <ryanneufeld> momomo: like 1+1=2 would become 1%201=2
[15:21:51] <ryanneufeld> which isn't exactly accurate
[15:22:16] <momomo> ryanneufeld, ideally jquery should be replacing spaces with %20
[15:22:39] <Drvur> http://jsfiddle.net/kd5bw3wy/
[15:22:42] <Drvur> hello guys!!
[15:22:51] <Drvur> someone see some wrong in my script
[15:23:04] <Drvur> is about this plugin
[15:23:05] <Drvur> http://w2ui.com/web/docs/form/fields-list
[15:23:11] <ryanneufeld> momomo: pull requests welcome :)
[15:23:12] <momomo> ryanneufeld, no.. i don't think that's a problem .. serializing the plus would yield %2B
[15:23:23] <Drvur> I can't to put the data in the dropdown
[15:23:25] <ryanneufeld> momomo: no, it wouldn't
[15:23:31] <momomo> it does here
[15:23:34] <ryanneufeld> does it
[15:23:35] <ryanneufeld> k
[15:23:45] <ryanneufeld> I assumed jquery serialze woudl leave it a +
[15:23:51] <ryanneufeld> so then you've got a solution
[15:24:12] <momomo> http://jsfiddle.net/3777d03n/4/
[15:24:36] <richie> Hello does anyone have an alternative method
[15:25:03] <momomo> ryanneufeld, yes, i've got a solution, although it annoys me that I have to replace at the end of the serializing .. walking though the url once more .. jquery should patch this and replace the space with %20
[15:25:25] <momomo> how can I do a pull request and change this .. do i commit to a separate branch?
[15:25:41] <dan_j> Hi. If I've got a DIV container with ID 'products-drop' AND class 'stay' and then a load of child elements with the class 'stay', is there a selector to select all those child elements?
[15:26:10] <ryanneufeld> momomo: start here http://contribute.jquery.org/
[15:26:17] <ryanneufeld> it explains everything
[15:27:28] <blinky_> Hi all, could some one please have a look at this and tell me why it doesn't work please - https://jsfiddle.net/caoc51hb/17/
[15:30:54] <momomo> ryanneufeld, i think it would take so much time for me to do this.. but i found the error:
[15:30:55] <momomo> http://hastebin.com/ugagigiwed.coffee
[15:31:08] <momomo> you see at the end of jQuery.param(.. ) ?
[15:31:19] <momomo> it replaces r20 with +
[15:31:25] <momomo> that part should be removed
[15:31:34] <momomo> everything else is actually using decodeURIComponent
[15:32:05] <guzzlefry> Are client-side upload process bars a thing yet?
[15:32:08] <guzzlefry> progress*
[15:33:59] <momomo> ryanneufeld, it would be nice if one could just replace a function and have the references use the local scope .. wher ethe fucntion is actually declared otherwise ..
[15:34:05] <silverdust> I have a preloader I'll like to show up on initial visit of the page and on click of anchor tags. How is the best way to handle it's listener. $('a:not([href*=javascript])').click() is what I'm thinking
[15:34:23] <ryanneufeld> momomo: you can replace anything in the $.fn namespace
[15:34:30] <silverdust> For the links part
[15:34:36] <Symes_Web> Ryan
[15:34:37] <momomo> ryanneufeld, yes, but I can't replace just that function
[15:34:41] <ryanneufeld> $.fn.serialze = function()
[15:34:44] <ryanneufeld> yes, you ca
[15:34:46] <Symes_Web> Been doing some debuggin
[15:34:48] <momomo> i need to provide other things that are private
[15:34:54] <momomo> like r20
[15:36:12] <momomo> and supply buildparams
[15:36:35] <momomo> is that easy for you to change and commit ?
[15:36:46] <momomo> it's just this line: return s.join( "&" ).replace( r20, "+" );
[15:36:55] <momomo> the last part needs to be removed
[15:37:41] <ryanneufeld> momomo: https://gist.github.com/ryanneufeld/7287bfda4225412a6b64
[15:38:16] <blinky_> Hi all, could some one please have a look at this and tell me why it doesn't work please - https://jsfiddle.net/caoc51hb/17/
[15:39:08] <silverdust> Anyone please. What's best to listen on before triggering preloader?
[15:39:44] <momomo> ryanneufeld, yes, which is really: url.replace( "%20", "+" ).replace("+", "%20"); .. which is not pretty
[15:39:55] <momomo> it should be fixed in the source
[15:40:36] <richie> what can i use instead of inspect element console log
[15:40:59] <Symes_Web> Blinky your missing a { after else
[15:41:23] <dan_j> If I stop a slideUp, how can I then reverse it to show the entire div, without it having to perform the entire slidedown? When I use slidedown, it has to start from the top and perform the full animation, even though it was stopped short of fully open.
[15:42:22] <ryanneufeld> momomo: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11369
[15:43:53] <ryanneufeld> momomo: perhaps using jQuery.param is what you want instead of using .serialze
[15:45:25] <ryanneufeld> momomo: it doesn't need to be done in the code, cause it already is, :P http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[15:49:12] <compact> hey, is there a plugin or anything. where i can have a dialog/window pop up on the screen, however only take up part of the page, then if a checkbox is selected it will appear in the window that is open
[15:49:22] <Symes_Web> just a quickie, how would you say: If the span already has a click handler...
[15:49:44] <ryanneufeld> Symes_Web: there is no way to know that AFAIK
[15:50:03] <Symes_Web> AFAIK?
[15:50:23] <ryanneufeld> *sigh* kids theses days
[15:50:28] <ryanneufeld> As Far As I Know
[15:50:30] <silverdust> Google it. It's a common acronym
[15:52:10] <Symes_Web> Ooo just discovered the one('click', function() {
[15:52:13] <Symes_Web> Pretty sweet
[15:52:14] <Symes_Web> Lol
[15:52:49] <silverdust> * on('click'
[15:53:45] <robertBusy> there's also a one(
[15:53:53] <Symes_Web> ^^^
[15:53:57] <phasespace> anything i pass into the data setting for $.ajax returns ___ is undefined. "data: {success: success} = Uncaught ReferenceError: success is not defined. before anything is triggered too
[15:54:05] <silverdust> what's that for?
[15:54:06] <momomo> ryanneufeld, i am not sure i follow what you are saying.. i cna use jQuery.param how ? I have a form first, i have to serialize it, no?
[15:54:13] <robertmaxrees> silverdust it binds once and then removes the listener.
[15:54:29] <ryanneufeld> @momomo read the docs man
[15:54:57] <silverdust> cool
[15:55:03] * silverdust takes a note
[15:55:20] <robertmaxrees> i usuaully tell people to avoid unbinding listeners but it's an option.
[15:56:09] <compact> hey, is there a plugin or anything. where i can have a dialog/window pop up on the screen, however only take up part of the page, then if a checkbox is selected it will appear in the window that is open. does this make sense? robertmaxrees you normally have the solution :P
[15:56:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:56:38] <robertmaxrees> like a modal for part of the window?
[15:56:40] <momomo> jQuery.param(jQuery('form').serializeArray(), false) .. changes nothing though
[15:56:50] <momomo> the replacement still occurs
[15:57:51] <compact> yeah robertmaxrees
[15:58:00] <robertmaxrees> you could make something like that i guess.
[15:58:17] <silverdust> robertmaxrees: I have this little function to call my preloader on page. What events do you think I should listen on to trigger it?
[15:58:31] <robertmaxrees> silverdust do what now?
[15:59:51] <silverdust> I'd just do a $('a').click() but I'm considering a[href="#"] and [href="javascript:void(0)"] cases
[15:59:54] <goddard> what is a good editor ?
[16:00:05] <goddard> ckeditor is annoying it keeps changing my text
[16:00:19] <robertmaxrees> silverdust why are you preloading anything within those event listeners?
[16:00:32] <silverdust> goddard: You mean wysiwyg editors?
[16:00:56] <silverdust> I want a preloader effect when users click links, while they wait
[16:01:05] <robertmaxrees> except that you can't really do that.
[16:01:17] <robertmaxrees> you can't rely on anything after they've clicked.
[16:01:45] <goddard> silverdust ya
[16:02:00] <silverdust> goddard: Try out tinymce
[16:02:02] <ryanneufeld> momomo: I'm sorry, I mis-read the code
[16:03:02] <silverdust> robertmaxrees: in rails, there's turbolinks that makes only the <body> content change when links are clicked. It fetches new page with ajax and shows its own preloader while loading the page
[16:03:11] <robertmaxrees> that's relevant ;)
[16:03:20] <silverdust> Got used to that and now I'm not using it
[16:03:27] <richie> hi robert!
[16:03:30] <robertmaxrees> though there should be a way to do that via turbolinks.
[16:03:42] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', 'a', function() { /* your stuff here */ });
[16:03:45] <robertmaxrees> do something like that.
[16:04:03] <silverdust> ok
[16:04:08] <richie> do you know what I can use instead of inspect elements console log? I'm trying to figure out a bug that is in a popup with an error message window
[16:04:50] <silverdust> I'll go with that
[16:05:00] <robertmaxrees> richie you can still use those tools
[16:05:22] <richie> It won't allow me to right click anything, and when I press "okay" it closes the window
[16:05:42] <robertmaxrees> is it an actual modal or is it a js alert window?
[16:06:01] <richie> js alert window
[16:06:15] <robertmaxrees> that's why.  set a breakpoint.
[16:06:38] <richie> how do I do that
[16:06:47] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[16:06:51] <robertmaxrees> check out this guide :)
[16:07:01] <richie> okay ty, you are always so much help! :)
[16:07:09] <silverdust> robertmaxrees: how about to have it loading till dom is ready
[16:07:34] <robertmaxrees> silverdust this is why you should check your library for this functionality
[16:07:43] <drei> hi
[16:07:58] <ryanneufeld> momomo: http://jsfiddle.net/0zvaca5j/
[16:07:59] <robertmaxrees> DOM has already hit "ready".
[16:08:00] <silverdust> I wrote the preloader before domready and removed inside domready but that didn't do it
[16:08:14] <robertmaxrees> silverdust right, because dom ready fires once.
[16:08:51] <drei> just wondering if anyone can help me with a click function?
[16:08:56] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ drei
[16:08:57] <b-ot> drei: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[16:09:35] <Symes_Web> Im off to bed. Thanks a lot Ryan you've helped me a lot tonight, everythings working great now
[16:09:39] <ryanneufeld> or if you have other elements in your form you can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/0zvaca5j/1/
[16:09:43] <drei> ok <b-ot>
[16:09:46] <ryanneufeld> momomo: http://jsfiddle.net/0zvaca5j/1/
[16:09:55] <robertmaxrees> drei b-ot isn't a person - it's a bot :)
[16:10:24] <silverdust> robertmaxrees: Just thought of this. Having it load even after dom is ready with a delay of about 500ms and then taken it off
[16:10:25] <jumpman> Thanks again ryanneufeld
[16:10:34] <drei> b-ot: can I post a fiddle on here?
[16:10:34] <b-ot> drei: my reply is no.
[16:10:36] <robertmaxrees> silverdust you need a callback instead.
[16:10:38] <jumpman> made me look good for the boss :p I owe you one
[16:10:43] <robertmaxrees> drei ... that's a bot.
[16:10:46] <robertmaxrees> it's not a person.
[16:10:53] <robertmaxrees> drei post your link to the channel.
[16:11:04] <ryanneufeld> jumpman: I'll take a bag of bunnie treats :p

[16:11:11] <drei> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5859/
[16:11:16] <robertmaxrees> silverdust and stop relying on dom ready for this.
[16:11:17] <ryanneufeld> who has bunnies
[16:11:27] <drei> sorry new to this
[16:11:36] <robertmaxrees> so what do you need?
[16:11:49] * silverdust head bangs in confusion
[16:11:51] <ryanneufeld> drei: you know you don't have to hit update every change right? you can just hit run
[16:12:04] <ryanneufeld> I've never seen a fiddle break 100 before
[16:12:42] <robertmaxrees> looks like they started with an example that others have been working with.
[16:12:50] <jumpman> If you want to pm me your address I'll hook it up :p
[16:13:25] <phasespace> I'm using $.ajax and setting data to : {success: success} and " Uncaught ReferenceError: success is not defined " is being returned. Any insight on why this might be happening?
[16:13:51] <robertmaxrees> do are you defining success as a variable somewhere?
[16:14:43] <robertmaxrees> drei for starters: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/DTcHh/5860/ - you don't need to wrap NewContent in $() every time you use it - it's already a jquery object.
[16:15:02] <drei> ryanneufeld: what do you mean "I've never seen a fiddle break 100 before"?
[16:15:05] <robertmaxrees> also, that $(this).click(function() { you're doing in there is going to cause you headaches.
[16:15:14] <jumpman> I'm also a designer if you need that kind of thing
[16:15:29] <ryanneufeld> drei: I've never seen a fiddle with so many revisions
[16:16:38] <drei> regarding fiddle, the toggle requires two clicks in some instances. Why is this and how can I fix it?
[16:16:57] <robertmaxrees> drei i just said that $(this).click() you have in there will cause your headaches.
[16:17:21] <robertmaxrees> you need to move that out of there.
[16:17:37] <drei> ryanneufeld: wasn't from scratch, I used an existing bootstrap skeleton I found
[16:17:47] <ryanneufeld> ah
[16:18:01] <ryanneufeld> that's likely why its so big then, everyone does the same thing :p
[16:18:08] <drei> thank you robertmaxrees. What can I try instead?
[16:18:16] <robertmaxrees> what exactly are you trying to do here
[16:18:31] <robertmaxrees> because this doesn't make any sense.
[16:18:38] <chillsurf> hi, maybe someone can help me out with my issue.I am struggling about the whole day with no luck. All I need is to make a javascript code that when a subpage visits an anchor link in my homepage to scroll some pixels below the anchor
[16:18:42] <drei> show and hide the accordion content when the tabs are clicked
[16:18:48] <phasespace> robertmaxrees: It's defined on the server and then res.send() to client...all documentation shows it working the way I have it
[16:19:36] <robertmaxrees> drei so you want a boostrap accordion?
[16:19:44] <drei> I have used append because it's using the bootstrap tabs markup (not accordion)
[16:19:49] <chillsurf> 	I can offer 10 euros to everyone who helps me via paypal
[16:19:52] <robertmaxrees> phasespace success needs to be a defined var client side.
[16:19:56] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf not the right place for that.
[16:20:06] <robertmaxrees> check out a freelance channel, otherwise we'll assist you for free.
[16:20:10] <chillsurf> you mean to offer money
[16:20:18] <chillsurf> haha
[16:20:20] <chillsurf> ok
[16:20:23] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf basically - this is a support channel.  we'll help you do it yourself.
[16:20:28] <robertmaxrees> we won't do it for you though.
[16:21:04] <chillsurf> thanks for that
[16:21:14] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html - drei check out the "collapse" section.
[16:21:17] <drei> robertmaxrees: yes using the bootstrap tabs markup
[16:21:18] <robertmaxrees> they have an accordion in there.
[16:21:43] <phasespace> serverside has: var obj = {success:true}; res.send(obj). How come I cant just say "data: obj", because thats the data being sent from the server, it should need to be defined in this context, right?
[16:22:04] <drei> ...reason for this is because the tabs need to show at the desktop size and the accordion needs to show on smaller devices
[16:22:27] <robertmaxrees> phasespace huh?  is your issue with a variable not being defined server-side or client-side?
[16:22:34] <drei> Nope cannot use the boostrap accordion in me case
[16:22:58] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[16:23:00] <drei> that's why I have used prepend
[16:23:01] <chillsurf> all i need is to add some code to my jquery so when I visit my homepage domain.com from domain.com/subdomains using anchors like domain.com/#anchor1, to be able to animate scrolling for some pixels below my anchor
[16:23:23] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf there are tons of tutorials on that.
[16:23:34] <drei> it's almost there just need to figure out the hiding and showing
[16:23:52] <phasespace> robertmaxrees: client side, but I wanted to show you what and how im sending the data because it doesnt make sense that I need to define the data that im sending.
[16:24:08] <drei> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5859/
[16:24:13] <robertmaxrees> phasespace the issue is that the client side doesn't have that variable defined.
[16:24:21] <robertmaxrees> drei https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/DTcHh/5861/ start here.
[16:24:23] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[16:24:44] <robertmaxrees> you need to explicitly close everything and then open the specific one.
[16:24:52] <drei> do you understand what I mean robertmaxrees?
[16:24:55] <robertmaxrees> yes i do.
[16:25:06] <robertmaxrees> look at what i just said ;)
[16:25:11] <phasespace> so in my case what would that look like then, given the server line of code I provided?
[16:25:16] <phasespace> robertmaxrees:
[16:25:16] <drei> ok cheers
[16:25:38] <chillsurf> I need a specific thing: to enter the homepage via domain.com/#anchor and go to anchor and after some time to animate scroll 100px below automatically. I need this to happen only when visits occur from the subpages.
[16:25:41] <robertmaxrees> phasespace the server-side setup is completely irrelevant.
[16:25:57] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf what part of that are you stuck on?
[16:26:03] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[16:26:16] <phasespace> robertmaxrees: oh okay, so how would I define all the data im sending  rendering it pointless to send the data?
[16:26:28] <chillsurf> robertmaxress:  I have successfully added animated scroll with jquery
[16:26:32] <robertmaxrees> phasespace make a fiddle of your client-side?
[16:26:39] <phasespace> robertmaxrees: sure
[16:26:44] <robertmaxrees> i feel like i'm missing something here.
[16:27:04] <phasespace> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/vkqxt2rc/
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> phasespace yeah, in this case, success isn't defined anywhere.
[16:27:22] <drei> this makes sense, and it's solved the toggle issue although...
[16:27:32] <robertmaxrees> you're referencing a variable that your client-side doesn't know anbything about.
[16:27:55] <phasespace> so how do I send data from the server to the client?
[16:28:14] <drei> although there is now an issue clicking through the tabs, the content doesn't show
[16:28:23] <robertmaxrees> phasespace that's handled in the success callback.
[16:28:33] <robertmaxrees> drei you need to not use .toggle()
[16:28:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to explicitly open and close things instead.
[16:28:42] <phasespace> server or client side?
[16:28:52] <drei> have to click twice for the content to show
[16:29:03] <robertmaxrees> phasespace https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vkqxt2rc/1/
[16:29:08] <robertmaxrees> see the success callback there?
[16:29:20] <robertmaxrees> drei right - you need to not use .toggle()
[16:29:42] <robertmaxrees> check the bootstrap docs to see if there's a .open() or .toggle('open') or something like that for you to use.
[16:29:48] <robertmaxrees> you need to explicitly close things and then open them.
[16:29:51] <drei> robertmaxrees: don't need to use toggle, looking for an alternative
[16:30:04] <robertmaxrees> drei check out the bootstrap docs :)
[16:30:05] <drei> sorry I am very new to qjuery functions
[16:30:13] <drei> *jquery
[16:30:15] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a jquery concern in this case - it's bootstrap.
[16:30:52] <robertmaxrees> well, kindasorta.
[16:31:22] <chillsurf> https://demo.gavick.com/wordpress/creativity/i am using this theme, and I am trying to visit the homepage from a subpage, but when I use an anchor, the anchor appears behind the menu header logo
[16:31:28] <phasespace> robertmaxrees: nice, so what exactly do I put in the success callback in the $.ajax method to send data from the server to the client?
[16:31:40] <robertmaxrees> phasespace that part is up to your server.
[16:31:53] <robertmaxrees> you're making an HTTP request - your server responds to that request with whatever.
[16:32:22] <chillsurf> I need to somehow make it appear by having it scrolled
[16:32:27] <ignite_v2> does anyone knows a slider script that would be used to display something like this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ewnu8hx9z4iff9/Screenshot%202015-03-26%2010.31.42.png?dl=0
[16:32:34] <ignite_v2> or that would be easy to configure
[16:32:36] <drei> thank you robertmaxrees, been very helpfull
[16:32:39] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf that's a big blank page.
[16:32:42] <phasespace> robertmaxrees: So this?: var obj = {success:true}; res.send(obj);
[16:32:57] <robertmaxrees> phasespace you'dhave to ask in #Node.js for that.
[16:33:08] <phasespace> robertmaxrees: you cant just tell me?
[16:33:18] <chillsurf> what do you mean?
[16:33:19] <robertmaxrees> phasespace i don't do enough with node to be able to dell you.
[16:33:34] <drei> can you explain the reason behind what you changed in your fiddle?
[16:33:38] <phasespace> robertmaxrees: nice thanks for the hlep
[16:33:48] <drei> so I don't make the same mistake again?
[16:34:04] <robertmaxrees> you were binding an event listener inside of an event listener for no real reason.
[16:34:24] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf i get a white page with the text "This theme is no longer available" when I go to that URL>
[16:34:32] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf http://i.imgur.com/i7Fq3uM.png
[16:34:53] <chillsurf> https://demo.gavick.com/wordpress/creativity/
[16:34:58] <chillsurf> I am able to see it properly
[16:35:00] <drei> ok thanks
[16:35:05] <chillsurf> thats really weird
[16:36:08] <robertmaxrees> drei https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/DTcHh/5862/ you want something like this.
[16:36:48] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf so where are you stuck?
[16:36:50] <chillsurf> https://www.gavick.com/wordpress-themes/creativity,128
[16:36:51] <robertmaxrees> like, what have you tried?
[16:37:02] <chillsurf> I have tried doing it by padding
[16:37:09] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[16:37:12] <chillsurf> but its destroys more things
[16:37:17] <chillsurf> and then i searched on the net
[16:37:30] <chillsurf> but i dont really ever have used a javascript script
[16:37:35] <chillsurf> its in gavicks theme
[16:37:42] <chillsurf> and animation scroll works
[16:37:43] <robertmaxrees> why doesn't the page just work any more?
[16:37:58] <chillsurf> I can visit the page of creativity
[16:38:19] <chillsurf> cant you? not the first nor the second link works?
[16:38:36] <robertmaxrees> ... they work now duder. the second link you sent worked.
[16:38:55] <chillsurf> of course....it had buy now button
[16:38:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to understand why you're trying to do this since, ostensibly, the page should just work.  did you find a bug or something in it?
[16:39:00] <chillsurf> :P
[16:39:08] <robertmaxrees> https://demo.gavick.com/wordpress/creativity/ this link works, too.
[16:40:19] <chillsurf> what I am trying to accomplish is that the user that has already visited homepage and has next visited a subpage, when he clicks on the home menu button, to get to the first page without having the slider seen again
[16:40:51] <chillsurf> I have used an anchor to the element I want to show up, but unfortunately it appears behind the menu header
[16:41:14] <robertmaxrees> without being able to see what you're talking about, I don't understand what you mean.
[16:41:20] <chillsurf> so I need somehow to be able to add animation when someone visits this specific link from another page
[16:41:25] <chillsurf> and not the same one
[16:41:31] <chillsurf> I hope I made it clear now
[16:41:45] <chillsurf> http://axia.edu.gr/ib-international-baccalaureate/
[16:42:01] <chillsurf> you can just press "APXIKH" button
[16:42:07] <chillsurf> to go to the home page and see my problem
[16:43:25] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you've found a bug with the template that you need to talk to the developer about
[16:43:45] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you could hack something in by doing jQuery(window).trigger('scroll'); on dom ready
[16:45:16] <chillsurf> can you point me in the right direction on learning some jquery
[16:45:20] <chillsurf> for that matter
[16:45:25] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/
[16:45:45] <ricki> When preforming ajax over ssl, is it necessary that the datatype be jsonp?
[16:45:50] <chillsurf> what should I search for? the problem is that I need it to be animated only when visited from another pagee as domain.com/anchor1
[16:46:00] <chillsurf> *  domain.com/#anchor1
[16:46:09] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf you need to see if the window.location.hash is set to something.
[16:46:20] <acidjazz> window.location.hashish
[16:46:26] <robertmaxrees> ricki not necessarily?
[16:46:27] <acidjazz> window.location.kush
[16:46:45] <robertmaxrees> if the page and the server are on the same port, protocol, and domain, no.
[16:47:02] <robertmaxrees> and even if they're not, jsonp has to be supported by the server anyway
[16:49:21] <achilles14> if they are on the different server, then jsonp is better
[16:49:28] <robertmaxrees> errm.
[16:49:30] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[16:49:34] <robertmaxrees> JSONP assumes a lot.
[16:50:15] <robertmaxrees> JSONP is one way around that, but the server needs to support it.
[16:52:04] <ricki> robertmaxrees: okay, i'm trying to implement a call that works good on my localhost, but fails on my server
[16:52:18] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[16:53:02] <drei> robermaxrees: can we use something like this - http://www.bootply.com/peFUdnwOpZ
[16:53:22] <robertmaxrees> drei ... i gave you working code...
[16:53:23] <drei> to show and hide the tabs content
[16:53:40] <ricki> chrome is telling me that the origin page was "loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint"
[16:54:07] <robertmaxrees> ricki so are you request an HTTP resource from an HTTPs page?
[16:54:40] <drei> but the tabs content doesn't show when clicking on the tabs
[16:54:50] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[16:55:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/DTcHh/5865/ this right here works.
[16:55:03] <drei> can you share again
[16:55:16] <drei> got disconneded for a sec
[16:55:19] <ricki> robertmaxrees:  I'm making the call via jquerys ajax object,  in it i'm setting the protocol explicitly to https
[16:55:23] <drei> *disconnected
[16:55:47] <robertmaxrees> ricki then you have an issue elsewhere.  check to make sure your server isn't redirecting you.
[16:55:48] <drei> cause I thought we can't use toggle
[16:55:52] <achilles14> hey ricki, you are not supposed to call via the jquery's ajax call
[16:56:03] <ricki> robertmaxrees:  I log the full url to console prior to the call and it looks correct
[16:56:05] <robertmaxrees> drei that fiddle doesn't use toggle.
[16:56:16] <robertmaxrees> ricki that doesn't mean you aren't getting redirected.
[16:56:26] <robertmaxrees> look at your network tab and watch the actual request.
[16:56:31] <achilles14> call a proxy server like a php file and then point it to the url you wish to
[16:56:40] <drei> this works although it's not toggling the active tab
[16:56:42] <robertmaxrees> achilles14 he's requesting something on his own server.
[16:56:55] <drei> ie. cannot close the active one
[16:56:56] <robertmaxrees> drei so you want to be able to close the current tab?
[16:57:26] <drei> as well yes
[16:57:39] <robertmaxrees> because that's easy - check to see if the current link is active and, if so, close the related tab.
[16:57:42] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, do the other code.
[16:58:41] <drei> sorry I didn't mean use toggle but same effect
[16:58:54] <robertmaxrees> right.  i just described the process.
[16:58:58] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot :)
[16:59:32] <drei> <robertmaxrees>: were you referring to me?
[16:59:35] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:01:25] <drei> robertmaxrees youy want me to try to do that yes?
[17:01:35] <robertmaxrees> correct :)
[17:01:56] <drei> "check to see if the current link is active and, if so, close the related tab"
[17:02:00] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:02:21] <drei> ok :)
[17:02:30] <ricki> robertmaxrees:  okay, In the network tab the only header set under general is the request url,  its the correct address.  I can copy and paste it into a new tab and it gives me back the correct response
[17:02:51] <drei> I'm actually glad you're not giving me the answer so I can learn in the process
[17:02:59] <robertmaxrees> ricki and you don't see any redirects or anything going on?
[17:03:04] <robertmaxrees> because something here isn't adding up.
[17:03:12] <ricki> but the headers under that are provisional?  no not that i can tell
[17:03:36] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean by "provisional"
[17:06:23] <Es0teric> anyone here use chartjs?
[17:06:43] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Es0teric
[17:06:43] <b-ot> Es0teric: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:07:15] <ricki> robertmaxrees:  yeah chrome is marking the other request headers as "provisional".  according to a quick google, it suggests that the request may not be getting sent
[17:07:35] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have other issues then.
[17:08:45] <ricki> robertmaxrees:  agreed, i need to do a bit more research,  thanks for the help!
[17:08:55] <robertmaxrees> fshosho
[17:09:39] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/ukcm5y6h/1/
[17:09:50] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:10:09] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getContext' of null
[17:10:15] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[17:10:28] <robertmaxrees> are you directing that at me for any particular reason?
[17:11:30] <Es0teric> oh snap my bad
[17:11:36] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i am all over the place
[17:11:45] <robertmaxrees> also that error sounds like your selector is either bad or you're not waiting for document ready.
[17:12:10] <skinofstars> yo, does anyone know what an $.ajax is expecting in order to trigger the done()?
[17:12:19] <skinofstars> shouldn't a 200 suffice?
[17:12:23] <drei> robertmaxrees- how come you did this var currentTab = $(this).children('a').attr('href');
[17:12:30] <robertmaxrees> a successful response and valid response body, skinofstars
[17:12:36] <drei> this: var currentTab = $(this).children('a').attr('href');
[17:12:52] <robertmaxrees> i saw it t the first time, drei
[17:12:58] <robertmaxrees> it's to type less later.
[17:13:05] <drei> sorry
[17:13:13] <robertmaxrees> plus gives things a nicer name.
[17:13:47] <drei> I put a dash in there to avoid confusion
[17:13:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:14:08] <robertmaxrees> camelCase is pretty common - i'd get used to it.
[17:14:15] <drei> I mean what is the reason why you got the currentTab?
[17:14:19] <skinofstars> robertmaxrees: hmm, i'm sending a 201 and valid json
[17:14:41] <robertmaxrees> skinofstars check out the .fail() callback and see what the error might be.
[17:14:51] <robertmaxrees> drei ... i use that later inthe code.
[17:14:58] <drei> ignore what I last wrote lol
[17:15:01] <drei> confused myself
[17:15:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:16:08] <drei> yes but that is where I got confused. So am wondering why you made a variable called currentTab?
[17:16:32] <robertmaxrees> instead of just using $this.children('a').attr('href'); ?
[17:17:37] <drei> sorry I meant why you used it to filter for the a href children with an attribute
[17:17:53] <robertmaxrees> i'm still lost.
[17:18:09] <robertmaxrees> see where i do $('.tab-content').children('div').hide(); ?
[17:18:14] <drei> couldn't you have just used $(this)
[17:18:22] <drei> on its own
[17:18:30] <robertmaxrees> hold up - you're convoluting things.
[17:18:30] <drei> yes
[17:18:36] <drei> yes
[17:18:54] <skinofstars> robertmaxrees: fail jqXHR contains status: 201, statusText "created" and the second param shows... parsererror.. oh
[17:18:56] <robertmaxrees> so $('.tab-content').children('div').hide(); hides all those content divs.  $(currentTab).show(); then shows the specific one you want to show.
[17:19:02] <robertmaxrees> skinofstars there you go :)
[17:19:12] <skinofstars> robertmaxrees: haha, thanks :)
[17:19:40] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[17:20:38] <drei> I understand that part
[17:21:04] <robertmaxrees> then what isn't clear?  i create a var to hold that value, and then show the one i care about.
[17:21:10] <drei> just didn't see the reason for $(this).children('a').attr('href');
[17:21:34] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the li that was clicked - i need the href from the <a> tag.
[17:21:55] <robertmaxrees> because the <li> doesn't tell me which data div i should be showing.
[17:22:26] <drei> as $(this) is already referring to $(".nav-tabs > li")
[17:22:26] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:22:38] <robertmaxrees> the current one, yes...
[17:22:48] <drei> well that's what I thought
[17:24:05] <drei> I see
[17:24:05] <DragonPunch> URHHGHHHH
[17:24:09] <DragonPunch> I FEEL LIKE IM GONA EXPLOOODOE
[17:24:13] <drei> :)
[17:24:15] <DragonPunch> MY ENERGY LEVEL IS SO HIGH RIGHT NOW
[17:24:21] <DragonPunch> HRNNNGG
[17:24:21] <compact> robertmaxrees, have you seen any examples of that dialog idea i was talking about earlier?
[17:27:00] <drei> and I thought $('.tab-content').children('div').hide(); would only hide the divs inside of it (ie. not the whole $('.tab-content')) as well. But it works
[17:29:28] <drei> robertmaxrees: are you back?
[17:30:21] <aluka__> hey can anyone help how to contact <agolcom> ?
[17:30:55] <arschmitz> aluka__: its 2:30 am for her
[17:31:02] <arschmitz> aluka__: how can i help you?
[17:31:26] <drei> I lost our last conversation cause I got disconnected - to make the active one hide and show what would I need to do?
[17:31:46] <aluka__> i want write a propasol for jquery learning center @ arschmitz?
[17:32:54] <aluka__> <arschmitz> how can i contact the mentor regarding jquery learning center ?
[17:37:46] <robertmaxrees> back
[17:38:36] <robertmaxrees> drei you'd need to test if the currentTab is active.  if so, hide it.
[17:38:46] <drei> is there a way to see the conversation history if I have closed that tab?
[17:38:47] <robertmaxrees> probably want to remove the active class on the li, too.
[17:39:09] <robertmaxrees> there are logs available here: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20150325.log.html
[17:39:18] <robertmaxrees> might be a little behind though.
[17:40:21] <drei> thanks robertmaxrees
[17:41:28] <drei> you're a legend mate :)
[17:41:42] <robertmaxrees> nah
[17:41:53] <robertmaxrees> just have some experience,.
[17:46:19] <drei> sure do
[17:46:32] <drei> trying to get that active tab
[17:47:14] <drei> would I need a new event or in that same one?
[17:47:19] <robertmaxrees> same one.
[17:47:46] <robertmaxrees> you can see if the current li is the active one pretty easily.
[17:51:42] <drei> hard for me
[17:51:49] <drei> var currentTabActive = $('nav-tabs > li').is('active');
[17:51:57] <robertmaxrees> .hasClass('active')
[17:53:11] <drei> we can maybe declare that variable outside the event
[17:53:16] <compact> robertmaxrees, have you seen any examples of that dialog idea i was talking about earlier?
[17:53:18] <drei> and then
[17:53:22] <robertmaxrees> drei huh?
[17:53:27] <robertmaxrees> compact no.
[17:53:44] <compact> just thinking other ways i can do it
[17:54:07] <drei> ah yes
[17:54:16] <robertmaxrees> why would a modal only take part of the page compact?
[17:56:38] <drei> just not sure how to use it
[17:56:50] <drei> var currentTab = $(this).children('a').attr('href').hasClass('active');
[17:56:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:56:57] <robertmaxrees> no...
[17:57:17] <robertmaxrees> to see if the current tab is active, you want to check $(this).hasClass('active')
[17:57:18] <drei> I know I am confusing myself
[17:57:34] <drei> do we need an if statment?
[17:58:00] <robertmaxrees> what do you think
[18:00:12] <drei> yes
[18:00:51] <drei> I just don't know where in the event it needs to go
[18:01:07] <robertmaxrees> the event handler, you mean.
[18:02:30] <drei> do we need to assign it to another variable for that
[18:02:37] <robertmaxrees> and you'll have a check to see if you have that active class - if so, hide the active tab.
[18:02:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, do the hide/show stuff from before.
[18:03:25] <drei> and then at the end we can say '&&'
[18:03:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:03:35] <drei> show it and hide it
[18:03:50] <chillsurf> Hi, i have this code from a tutorial and i cant make it workhttps://jsfiddle.net/k9abeqt2/
[18:03:52] <robertmaxrees> 1st off - no "we", all "you".  2nd off: no need for && anywhere.
[18:04:03] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf open your console.
[18:04:40] <compact> robertmaxrees, because i want to action certain boxes that have been done in a checkbox
[18:04:50] <compact> without changing page
[18:05:52] <robertmaxrees> compact it sounds like you want a tooltip?
[18:06:35] <drei> what do you mean by 1st off - no "we", all "you".?
[18:06:37] <chillsurf> what console robertmaxrees?
[18:06:45] <compact> na, because this "modal" will have options etc
[18:06:48] <compact> more drop down boxes
[18:06:52] <robertmaxrees> your browser console, chillsurf
[18:06:59] <chillsurf> i did
[18:07:02] <chillsurf> but why?
[18:07:02] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[18:07:04] <robertmaxrees> read this.
[18:07:19] <robertmaxrees> the console will tell you exactly what the problem is.
[18:08:27] <drei> robertmaxrees: Running out of time with this, If you don't mind you might need to update the fiddle for me and I will learn from this I promise!
[18:08:37] <robertmaxrees> not how i work buddy :)
[18:08:49] <robertmaxrees> if you need somebody else to do it for you, check out one of the freelance channels
[18:10:01] <drei> I totally understand. Thank you robertmaxrees, you are a legend still!
[18:10:01] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf you don't have jquery included in that fiddle.
[18:10:23] <drei> thanks for that link
[18:10:26] <robertmaxrees> chillsurf that's why i was saying to check your console - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k9abeqt2/1/
[18:11:57] <chillsurf> the slider you sent em messed my head, but I will check it out omorrow when i'll be chilling
[18:12:09] <robertmaxrees> slider?
[18:12:11] <chillsurf> as for the jsfiddle sorry, it seems to be working now
[18:12:19] <chillsurf> the tutorial
[18:12:28] <robertmaxrees> oh that.
[18:12:32] <chillsurf> about jquery common mistakes and info
[18:12:36] <robertmaxrees> fyi those are usually called carousels
[18:12:41] <robertmaxrees> not sliders.
[18:12:49] <chillsurf> I need some help to understand jquery
[18:13:00] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a good resource.
[18:13:22] <chillsurf> if I create  theme/js/myscript.js and paste the javascript code in there
[18:13:29] <chillsurf> and also add css and html
[18:13:52] <chillsurf> How is it pointed to the file i created? i miss that part
[18:14:00] <robertmaxrees> how is what pointed there?
[18:14:03] <robertmaxrees> the html?
[18:14:06] <chillsurf> yes
[18:14:18] <robertmaxrees> by using a script tag.
[18:14:57] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script
[18:14:59] <chillsurf> is it stupid to ask but how can i do it id i use wordpress?
[18:15:09] <robertmaxrees> dunno -  i don't use wordpress.
[18:15:17] <robertmaxrees> probably need to edit the template
[18:15:29] <chillsurf> ohh thanks. i understand now
[18:15:50] <chillsurf> and is it possible to add it to wordpress? Because I dont know where to really add it
[18:16:03] <chillsurf> can i add it as html in a post?
[18:16:07] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:16:14] <chillsurf> i'll better ask in wordpress
[18:16:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:16:32] <robertmaxrees> i just said i don't use wordpress sooo....
[18:16:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:16:36] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[18:16:51] <chillsurf> ok thanks
[18:17:04] <chillsurf> as for the record, why dont you use it?
[18:30:59] <drei> robertmaxrees: Managed to get it working this way - https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5878/
[18:54:29] <chillsurf> robertmaxrees: I have created a functions.php file in the child theme folder which contains the http://pastebin.com/eXgWZJhs , and also a the /js/scrolltotop.js file which has the js code of the example: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k9abeqt2/1/
[18:55:33] <chillsurf> in the post i want the arrow to appear, I have entered the html code: <a href="#" class="scrollToTop">Scroll To Top</a>  and also in the css file i have added the css code
[19:32:59] <lambdumb> how can I run an .append for each item I get an a json array?
[19:33:29] <lambdumb> like if I have 5 keys in my json array I get via ajax, i want to append each of them to a div
[19:34:46] <mekhami> just loop over the array and append inside the loop?
[19:35:22] <mekhami> (pseudocode) for key, value in array container.append(div with values)
[19:36:47] <lambdumb> how would that look?
[19:39:08] <mekhami> lambdumb http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/03/43439-reasons-to-use-append-correctly
[19:40:11] <mekhami> obviously don't use the extremely optimized versions unless you understand them
[19:40:16] <mekhami> but the second or third example can work for you
[19:43:00] <lambdumb> mekhami if i were to put this into an ajax success call it would look like this, right? http://pastebin.com/TquTKT04
[19:43:22] <mekhami> lambdumb move your success function to a function outside of this
[19:43:29] <mekhami> do yourself that favor
[19:43:36] <mekhami> and then just call that function in success
[19:43:56] <mekhami> but yeah that's how you can do it
[19:44:08] <mekhami> you'll get a major peformance increase if you do it the third way though
[19:44:09] <lambdumb> . . .hate to sound ignorant (cause i'm new) but is there a difference
[19:44:19] <mekhami> lambdumb readability and flexibility
[19:44:29] <mekhami> you could write all of windows 95 in one function, but why would you?
[19:45:54] <lambdumb> true, true
[19:46:04] <lambdumb> then again, I wouldn't want to write windows 95
[19:46:11] <mekhami> you'll thank yourself later if you write clean code ;)
[19:46:17] <mekhami> but i highly recommend looking into the third example
[19:46:23] <mekhami> use the loop to build one string
[19:46:26] <mekhami> then append that string
[19:46:34] <mekhami> instead of appending multiple times inside the loop
[19:46:45] <mekhami> append is a much slower function than string concatenation
[19:51:20] <andrew9183> can you explain why
[19:52:01] <rcyr> andrew9183: I can tell you why if you want
[19:52:20] <andrew9183> sure
[19:52:44] <rcyr> On a browser, one of the most expensive operation is "repainting"
[19:52:55] <rcyr> Everything you change something in the DOM, you cause a repaint
[19:52:59] <rcyr> *Everytime
[19:53:25] <rcyr> So... if you use append in a loop, you forcing your browser to repaint every iteration, that's super slow.
[19:53:36] <rcyr> *you're forcing (Can't write tonight)
[19:53:49] <mekhami> rcyr TIL. I knew it was slower but I know so little about the details. thanks!
[19:54:06] <lambdumb> mekhami, how's this look? http://pastebin.com/WJa7EXSq
[19:54:07] <rcyr> If you use string concatenation to build a string then do a single "append" then you're only cause a single repainting.
[19:54:34] <rcyr> mekhami: You're welcome
[19:54:42] <mekhami> looks about right, lambdumb. But i'd still move your anonymous function to an external function and call it ;)
[19:54:46] <BillCriswell> rcyr: Not true if you're creating a fragment and appending it all at once (though just creating a giant string and appending it at once is still faster).
[19:55:08] <lambdumb> mekhami, i understand youre reasoning but i'm not using this function anywhere else
[19:55:17] <lambdumb> anyways though thanks for your help!
[19:55:24] <rcyr> BillCriswell: I know. I love you but I think you're being a bit too pedantic :)
[19:55:33] <BillCriswell> rcyr: of course I am haha
[19:55:35] <rcyr> I was just explaining "his case"
[19:55:41] <lambdumb> just to make sure: the above would append however many list elements as there are array items?
[19:55:45] <andrew9183> how are you string concatenating? :D
[19:55:45] <lambdumb> from the ajax call?
[19:55:47] <BillCriswell> rcyr: All too familiar with it, totally understood.
[19:56:00] <mekhami> lambdumb sure seems like it
[19:56:13] <lambdumb> alright, cool
[19:56:39] <BillCriswell> andrew9183: I typically build use an array then .join('')
[19:58:39] <BillCriswell> doubt it's as efficient as just += the whole time but i don't care... I'm a loner dottie, a rebel
[20:00:31] <BillCriswell> bed timmeee maybe
[20:02:55] <chillsurf> sorry can someone help me on setting a wp_enqueue_script?
[20:03:07] <chillsurf> i have it working
[20:03:23] <chillsurf> in the original theme's script file
[20:04:16] <chillsurf> but i want to remove it from the original file and make it work from childethemefolder/js/example.js
[20:05:00] <mekhami> chillsurf check the channel ;)
[20:05:30] <chillsurf> mekhami: what do you mean?
[20:05:40] <mekhami> you're in #jquery not #wordpress =P
[20:06:00] <mekhami> unless my client is all sorts of messed up
[20:06:16] <chillsurf> you are right sorry
[20:12:47] <Whirled> zkv, yes it can
[20:14:45] <AlluringMe> Hi, I have this coded. http://bae.net16.net/3/login_success.php | UN/PWD: test/test123
[20:15:05] <AlluringMe> I need a idea to append the content from DB to the boxes 1 2 and 3
[20:15:24] <AlluringMe> I roughly have a idea in head but I am not sure how to proceed further
[20:16:15] <AlluringMe> I am thinking; the div's have id's 1, 2, and 3 assigned to em... I will append the query results to the div
[20:16:24] <AlluringMe> Any better ideas?
[20:17:20] <AlluringMe> Wtf " I have this coded" lol *I've coded this.
[20:26:12] <se_busca_ayuda> Hi, I’m trying to implement JQuery with famo.us and i’m trying to implement a simple autocomplete box. It’s not working. Here’s my code: http://hastebin.com/sacamoloca.xml
[20:27:24] <LiENUS> so what version of firefox does the jquery 2.x line require?
[20:30:56] <symfonius> Hello... I have this line of HTML  <tr class="table-administrative-staff-only-loading" style="display: none;">
[20:31:08] <symfonius> But when I call  $('#table-administrative-staff-only-loading').toggle();
[20:31:12] <symfonius> it doesn't make it appear?
[20:31:33] <Whirled> classes us $(.classname)
[20:31:36] <Whirled> *use
[20:31:51] <Whirled> ID's use $("#id");
[20:32:01] <Whirled> symfonius ^
[20:32:45] <Whirled> $(".table-admini.....") would work,,,,or <tr id='table-adm...."> see?
[20:32:46] <symfonius> ah, oops
[20:32:47] <symfonius> cheers
[20:33:33] <Whirled> Plus I think it's better to use CSS Classes than inline styles.
[20:33:34] <drei> anyone have issues with hiding and showing a dropdown on mobile - it closes on scroll
[20:33:48] <drei> ie. doesn't stay open
[20:34:09] <Whirled> paste your code to JSFiddle with a working example. Otherwise it's impossible to tell.'
[20:35:48] <drei> you mean me Whirled?
[20:35:54] <Whirled> sorry, yes
[20:35:59] <drei> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5877/
[20:36:03] <Whirled> thx
[20:36:38] <drei> works fine on desktop - it's just on mobile devices it doesn't stay open
[20:36:50] <drei> ...as you scroll
[20:37:18] <Whirled> loading on my note edge, one minute please
[20:40:39] <Whirled> doesn't scroll. Probably cause the screen is too big.
[20:40:45] <symfonius> question
[20:40:50] <symfonius> I have a table with a couple of rows
[20:40:54] <symfonius> sometimes it's 2, sometimes 3
[20:40:55] <drei> any ideas guys?
[20:40:58] <symfonius> it's dynamically generated
[20:41:12] <Whirled> Is it possibly that you are referring to $(this) when it means ".nav-tabs" rather than the tab in question? drei?
[20:41:39] <Whirled> sry...
[20:41:47] <Whirled> misread it. Still thinking
[20:41:47] <drei> what do you mean whirled?
[20:41:58] <KevinB> hi
[20:42:09] <KevinB> i have some question on jquery-ui, dialog
[20:42:20] <symfonius> is it possible to replace those 2 or 3 rows with 1 row in jquery
[20:42:24] <symfonius> while retaining the height?
[20:42:48] <Whirled> symfonius sounds like a css thing to me.
[20:43:36] <KevinB> id like to initialize i want to initialize a new instance of the viewmodel when the dialog is opened.
[20:43:42] <Whirled> drei, I am sorry, but I have no idea.
[20:44:49] <Whirled> KevinB have you looked at the docs for jquery UI to see if there is an event passed when the dialog opens?
[20:45:35] <drei> thanks Whirled
[20:46:02] <Whirled> KevinB, http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-open
[20:47:59] <KevinB> so, is it possible to create new instance of my model in jquery?
[20:48:49] <Whirled> KevinB, paste your code to jsfiddle until I am granted psychic abilities...I hear it's coming next month. Until then, I need your help if you want help
[20:49:40] <Whirled> drei, are you appending the entire tab-content to the menu item each time it is clicked?
[20:49:45] <drei> see updated fiddle - https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5887/ - I need to make the active tab close on click
[20:50:06] <KevinB> fiffle supports mvc?
[20:50:11] <KevinB> fiddle
[20:50:42] <drei> at the moment can click through each tab but cannot click to close on the one that is currently open
[20:50:51] <Whirled> KevinB, MVC is a concept....that's why it's hard to answer your question. Conceptually, yes
[20:51:02] <drei> yes
[20:51:38] <drei> needs to work this way because I am using the boostrap tabs markup but I need to show an accordion at the smaller window size
[20:51:40] <Whirled> perhaps you should just append the contents once then hide/show them. Append onlty the content shown per item. Gimme a second
[20:52:00] <KevinB> ok, so i have a dialog in a div. The content of the div is a partial view. It has a model of type CreateAssignmentViewModel. If I open and close the dialog, the model remains filled
[20:52:08] <drei> it's working fine as it is, just need to close the current tab also
[20:53:01] <drei> thanks Wirled
[20:53:15] <drei> *Whirled
[20:55:02] <se_busca_ayuda> Hi, I’m trying to implement JQuery with famo.us and i’m trying to implement a simple autocomplete box. It’s not working. Here’s my code: http://hastebin.com/sacamoloca.xml
[20:56:12] <Whirled> drei, I can't see the advantage to appending the content every time. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems that appending the content once (each Li has it's own tab-content') would be much easier and better....I'll try it
[20:56:34] <Whirled> then you'd only have to toggle a class to show the content
[20:56:37] <Whirled> and hide the content
[20:57:12] <drei> are you having a look Whirled?
[20:58:21] <Whirled> looking
[20:58:53] <drei> just looking for a different way then the one that is commented out in the Fiddle to see if it fixes the scroll issue on mobile
[20:59:27] <drei> thank you Whirled, waiting for what you can come up with
[21:01:55] <symfonius> Hi guys, another question
[21:01:57] <symfonius> Please see http://pastebin.com/7HX3igEF
[21:02:07] <symfonius> Dynamically, a bunch of records like that get generated
[21:02:42] <symfonius> With jQuery - dynamically - given an ID I want to match it up against the first column (ie. 16) and edit the 105 L to something else
[21:02:50] <symfonius> how can I do that
[21:03:41] <jak2000> symfonius YOU KNOW MATH?
[21:03:59] <Whirled> Very odd. I don't know bootstrap, so it's doing something I've never seen. This is how I would have approached it: https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5892/
[21:04:10] <Whirled> it doesn't work, but the logic is sound.
[21:04:12] <Whirled> lol
[21:04:32] <symfonius> jak2000 - not sure where you are leading with that
[21:04:41] <Whirled> actually, I wouldn't use .hide() or .show() just .toggle the .active class and use css to hide or show
[21:05:52] <jak2000> symfonius: http://pastie.org/10054092
[21:06:12] <symfonius> What in God's name are you talking about
[21:06:23] <Whirled> drei, see, what I did was put the content you are appending inside the li just like you do with the append...but only once. then toggle its visibility
[21:06:29] <drei> sorry Whirled got disconnected
[21:06:39] <drei> you come up with anything?
[21:07:07] <Whirled> Here is the logic that I would use. It's not working with the bootstrap framework, but you can see what I was thinking...
[21:07:09] <Whirled> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5892/
[21:08:02] <Whirled> basically I listened to the click event on the UL, then figured out which li was clicked. If active, hide it's content. If not, clear all active and set it active.show content
[21:09:21] <drei> yep, but not working
[21:09:33] <drei> thanks for having a look though
[21:09:38] <Whirled> I'll have to look at bootstrap.
[21:10:34] <symfonius> what is the best way to search td's for that matching number, then get the nearest td on the right?
[21:12:08] <drei>  
[21:13:35] <drei> is there a way to stay connected in channel longer?
[21:13:43] <drei> keep disconnecting after a while
[21:13:56] <rcyr> Get a real IRC client.
[21:15:30] <Whirled> I hope there is an expert here on jqmobile. Because the amount of appending you do for every menu selection would tax even the most robust smart phone.
[21:17:35] <drei> sorry what you mean Whirled?
[21:17:41] <Whirled> wait. And once you append a div with an id, then append it again, you have conflicts
[21:18:32] <Whirled> If you append two divs with the same ID, it's bound to mess up. So appending the content every time you select a menu item can't work correctly after the second click....your html becomes invalid.
[21:20:16] <Whirled> okay, but look at your resultant code. When you click item 2 then 3 then 2 you have 2 copies of your content under 2. Do it about 3 more times and it will lock up
[21:21:53] <drei> Whirled: even using this technique - https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5896/
[21:21:56] <drei> ?
[21:22:06] <drei> there is only the 1 div id
[21:22:25] <drei> the div is being moved not duplicated
[21:23:17] <drei> this should be ok, right?
[21:23:26] <Whirled> why move the invisible stuff?
[21:23:44] <drei> valid
[21:23:53] <Whirled> That's what I am not getting. Why move anything? If you add active to the LI, it will show the content
[21:24:05] <aro> i have two words, 'Low' and 'High', and I have a counter that goes from 0 to 1 (via percentage) how would i fade one word to the next based ont he percent complete?
[21:24:06] <Whirled> just but the divs under each li and it should work without appending
[21:25:01] <aro> like, at 0% have 'Low' be black, and 'High' be off white
[21:25:17] <aro> and as it gets to 100%, have 'High' be black, and 'Low' be off white
[21:26:57] <drei> Whirled - the markup using the technique in the fiddle above is correct right (ie. still the one div not duplicates)?
[21:28:21] <jak2000> symfonius: http://pastie.org/10054117
[21:28:24] <chillsurf> can someone help me out on how to check why my site crashes?
[21:28:28] <jak2000> th solution
[21:28:29] <rochadt> aro: sounds interesting, I'm starting a fiddle
[21:28:30] <chillsurf> it crashes only in chrome
[21:28:36] <chillsurf> a specific page
[21:32:04] <Whirled> drei, here ya go: https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5904/
[21:34:37] <drei> great Whirled
[21:35:07] <drei> can you make the active tab close on click also?
[21:35:31] <Whirled> lemme check. If not it's easy to do, just check for active and remove it if so
[21:37:17] <drei> Whirled: Hide active tab on load and close the active tab on click
[21:41:13] <drei> what irc client most people use?
[21:41:23] <Whirled> mirc
[21:42:10] <Whirled> I think you have to have one tab active. So, make a blank tab to make it active...brb
[21:42:34] <rcyr> drei: Depends on your OS.
[21:42:41] <rochadt> aro: this uses opacity http://jsfiddle.net/2bfz68m7/
[21:43:11] <rochadt> if you need it to change to color instead it probably wouldn't be that hard
[21:44:01] <drei> Whirled: I just realized you manually moved the html reather then it being done with javascript
[21:44:20] <drei> that's not what I was after
[21:45:51] <Whirled> you can do it with js. just do it once
[21:49:35] <drei> what you mean Whirled?
[21:52:17] <drei> -

[21:56:17] <AlluringMe_> I am passing this from PHP echo "<script>". '$(document).ready( function(){ $( "<p>Test</p>" ).appendTo( "#3" ); });' . "</script>";
[21:56:29] <AlluringMe_> JQ page does not see the data
[21:56:50] <pulpfiction> if i have an element like this: <td><b id="#name">name:</b> pulpfiction<b>, email:</b> something@gmail.com</td>
[21:57:06] <pulpfiction> how would i retrieve "pulpfiction"?
[21:57:48] <AlluringMe_> I rebuild client side DB using the id's I'd stored for text areas. Rest all looks sexy for now; http://bae.net16.net/3/login_success.php || UN/PWD: test/test123
[21:58:06] <Whirled> drei, I have no idea why it refuses to remove class active.
[21:58:33] <pulpfiction> is it possible to retrieve the text between two elements maybe?
[22:01:01] <drei> it's ok whirled
[22:01:12] <Whirled> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5930/
[22:01:37] <Whirled> Check it out. LOL I tell it to log the class of the li and it says active. Then I ask if it is .active and it says false.
[22:02:17] <drei> anyone know best practices in triggering scripts at different screen sizes
[22:02:17] <Whirled> did they get rid of "is" and "removeClass"
[22:04:10] <Whirled> bootstrap is using :focus and ::Before to append active without scripting. LOL That's why you can't remove it.
[22:04:20] <drei> wow cool Whirled
[22:04:26] <drei> that's great
[22:04:49] <Whirled> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5934/
[22:05:02] <Whirled> that is all you need. Just append the content once and it will do the rest with css
[22:05:16] <drei> Whirled: Hide active tab on load and close the current active tab on click
[22:05:25] <Whirled> You will have to override the css if you wan to do that.
[22:09:20] <drei> sorry didn't get you Whirled
[22:10:20] <drei> if I use the active pseudo, it's going to hide all active no matter what
[22:13:40] <drei> Whirled you still there?
[22:16:57] <drei> -
[22:19:29] <Whirled> yeah. I don't know what is going on. Sorry I can't help. It refuses to remove the active class. I give up
[22:20:03] <Whirled> I would ask the bootstrap people
[22:20:06] <drei>  
[22:21:29] <drei> no worries, thanks
[22:23:55] <drei>  
[22:23:57] <drei>  
[22:25:21] <Uhkis> Whirled: what's your problem?
[22:25:57] <Whirled> where do you want me to start?
[22:26:06] <Whirled> When I was five...
[22:26:07] <Whirled> lol
[22:26:19] <Whirled> I just don't know bootstrap.
[22:27:29] <Uhkis> what do you want your fiddle to do?
[22:28:01] <Whirled> remove the 'active' class from the li whose a was clicked.
[22:29:51] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5945/
[22:30:46] <Whirled> exactly
[22:30:48] <Whirled> doesn't do i88t
[22:30:56] <Uhkis> yes, it does
[22:30:58] <Whirled> still shows the content still has the active
[22:31:30] <Whirled> Cool. Then it's solved. Except on my computer
[22:31:34] <Woet> hi Uhkis
[22:32:09] <Uhkis> morning Woet
[22:32:47] <Woet> afternoon
[22:33:19] <Whirled> so, Uhkis, you honestly see the content disappear and the li no longer has the active class?
[22:34:16] <Uhkis> so your problem is, something puts the active class back
[22:34:48] <Whirled> lol. Right. I thought it was the pseudo class for focus and :before
[22:35:37] <Whirled> but disabling css didn't fix the problem.
[22:39:29] <phiz> Whirled: what it looks like on mine https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ib27ux6oypzkx2/whirled.m4v?dl=0
[22:42:36] <Whirled> phiz. Click on an active tab
[22:42:41] <Whirled> and make it go away
[22:44:59] <phiz> Whirled: you mean like click Messages, then click Messages again?
[22:45:06] <Whirled> yep
[22:45:13] <Whirled> thanks for the help, btw.
[22:51:20] <phiz> Whirled: yeah it doesn't do anything after the first time you click it
[22:51:22] <phiz> at least for me
[22:51:43] <Whirled> thats the problem
[22:52:38] <phiz> once you click a link the href goes away
[22:52:41] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/5946/
[22:53:06] <phiz> Uhkis's seems to work
[22:54:07] <Whirled> Yep. drei, thank Uhkis
[22:54:11] <Whirled> thanks uhkis
[22:55:05] <Whirled> Not the most elegant solution considering the styling of the anchor element, but it works, so whose complaining
[22:55:18] <Whirled> *who is. not whose.
[22:56:31] <Uhkis> btw, tabs are super easy to implement yourself, those plugins just make a simple thing annoying
[22:57:33] <symfonius> could someone here please have a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29250027/bootstrap-datepicker-format-not-working/29250600?noredirect=1#comment46706084_29250600 ?
[22:58:01] <Whirled> agreed. It's for deis, he asked.
[23:02:53] <Uhkis> ?demo @ symfonius
[23:02:54] <b-ot> symfonius: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[23:03:44] <symfonius> Uhkis - can I upload custom js on jsfiddle?
[23:04:01] <symfonius> the bootstrap-datepicker.js I don't think is on googleapi or anything
[23:04:59] <phiz> I don't see why you can't
[23:05:31] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/vuucxvrc/
[23:05:34] <Uhkis> seems to work just fine
[23:07:20] <symfonius> Mine says  * Datepicker for Bootstrap v1.4.0 (https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker)
[23:07:24] <symfonius> maybe I'll try yours
[23:07:27] <symfonius> it looks to be 1.5.0
[23:09:39] <symfonius> ah
[23:09:46] <symfonius> I had the datepicker ob the div instead of the input
[23:09:49] <symfonius> that fixed it
[23:09:50] <symfonius>  thanks
[23:13:30] <symfonius> final question, can I crossfade when replacing text?
[23:13:40] <symfonius> ie. I'm using .text()  to change values right now
[23:13:49] <symfonius> can I make the old one fade out as the new one fades in?
[23:14:49] <Uhkis> foo.fadeOut(400, function() { bar.fadeIn(400); });
[23:30:26] <manzoor> Hi #jquery.
[23:31:16] <manzoor> In jquery-mobile, I want to show a popup on all pages. But it only displays within the <div /> page where it is declared, on any other page it doens't show.
[23:31:33] <manzoor> I call the popup by this code: $('#confirmDeletePopup').popup('open');
[23:32:01] <symfonius> if I want to get the child span of some element I already have got through a selector
[23:32:01] <manzoor> What can I do show popup on all pages without copying the popup div to all pages (as I have a lot of pages.)
[23:32:04] <symfonius> what do i do?
[23:32:16] <symfonius> .child('span') ?
[23:33:44] <symfonius> there is only one child
