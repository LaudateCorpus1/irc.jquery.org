[00:55:09] <ribot> re
[00:56:22] <ribot> using this code, triggered inside an input text field, i don't get the text value of the input field: $('.class').keydown(function(e){alert($(this).val());});
[00:57:22] <GoSox> hey Eviltwin
[00:59:38] <GoSox> ok then, hey anyone. I have some columns that are DIVs. their width is dynamic, aka percentage based, not fixed pixels. When I use query to load content into those DIVs, the end product is great. But while the animation is going on, things kind of go crazy
[00:59:58] <GoSox> to see it in action, choose a state and a city here. The red boxes are the layout divs
[00:59:59] <GoSox> http://new.menulizard.com/by-city/
[01:04:27] <LukeNukem> var dislikescount = $(".dislike_link_comment").attr('data-dislikes');
[01:04:41] <LukeNukem> im trying the get the value of data-dislikes from class dislike_link_comment
[01:04:42] <LukeNukem> but i get undefined when i alert it
[01:05:13] <GoSox> can you get an attribute from multiple items like that?
[01:05:23] <LukeNukem> i dont know :s
[01:05:28] <GoSox> i would think not
[01:05:40] <GoSox> how would you even process them
[01:05:55] <LukeNukem> http://pastebin.com/BVRwhU6k
[01:05:56] <LukeNukem> see line 3
[01:06:09] <LukeNukem> so how can i get the data-attribute of that class
[01:06:22] <GoSox> what i mean is, .attr returns a string
[01:06:45] <GoSox> a class doesn't have an attribute, each individual element of a class has an attribute
[01:06:54] <GoSox> so you probably have to loop through the elements of that class
[01:07:03] <GoSox> and i don't know how you would do that
[01:08:05] <LukeNukem> :s
[01:08:25] <GoSox> there could also be a more direct way to do it than looping through each item, i dunno
[01:08:33] <Eviltwin> Okay, I've got 5 minutes before I'm going to sleep
[01:08:46] <Eviltwin> Quickly sum up what you're trying to do
[01:09:13] <GoSox> Eviltwin: my Q is simple: why are my columns (in red) going crazy during animations? http://new.menulizard.com/by-city/
[01:10:24] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, please answer my question
[01:10:35] <Eviltwin> GoSox: .show and .hide can be werid
[01:10:39] <LukeNukem> i need to get the data attribute of a class called dislike_link_element
[01:10:39] <LukeNukem> http://pastebin.com/BVRwhU6k
[01:10:41] <LukeNukem> see line 3
[01:10:45] <Eviltwin> They try to guess what the width was supposed to be
[01:10:50] <GoSox> Eviltwin: it does with with slide up and slide down too, just to a lesser degree
[01:10:55] <Eviltwin> Ugh, .live
[01:11:14] <Eviltwin> Is there only one of this class?
[01:11:18] <LukeNukem> yes
[01:11:29] <Eviltwin> Use .data("dislikes") instead
[01:11:40] <LukeNukem> ok
[01:13:01] <GoSox> Eviltwin: i just switched it back to just slideUp and slideDown. it still jiggles as it's loading data. but it shouldn't because the width of a % based table cell is not effected by it's content unless there is an object wider than the cell wants to be, and is pushing it out
[01:13:12] <GoSox> (a css table cell, not an html table cell)
[01:14:32] <Eviltwin> The problem is that without a fixed width in pixels, jQuery pretty much has to guess how wide it should be
[01:14:58] <GoSox> how wide what should be? jquery shouldn't be touching the width of anything
[01:15:10] <GoSox> it's putting block level items in a predefined table cell
[01:15:24] <Eviltwin> You are using .animate
[01:15:30] <Eviltwin> .animate touches CSS properties
[01:16:56] <GoSox> :/
[01:17:04] <Eviltwin> How else would it work?
[01:17:28] <GoSox> i still don't see how what your saying is effecting the width of anything else
[01:17:35] <GoSox> right now i'm using only slide up and slide down
[01:17:41] <GoSox> so forget show/hide for now
[01:18:03] <GoSox> the cell is 25% of the available space, and the LI contained within is a block item that fills all available width
[01:18:11] <GoSox> i don't see where the 'grey area' is?
[01:18:26] <Eviltwin> If I had to guess your lists are actually pushing it out further for whatever reason
[01:18:33] <Eviltwin> I don't think jQuery is to blame for this one
[01:19:01] <Eviltwin> Right now, for me, they're only bugging out when they completely hide
[01:19:16] <Eviltwin> i.e. display:none; height:0
[01:19:27] <GoSox> i'm getting a jiggle any time any column slides up or slides down
[01:19:43] <Eviltwin> Right
[01:19:43] <GoSox> a small one though
[01:20:00] <Eviltwin> But for me that giggle is happening in the instant between when the column hide animation stops
[01:20:04] <Eviltwin> And the column show animation starts
[01:20:23] <GoSox> agreed
[01:20:27] <Eviltwin> This is because slideUp ends by setting display: none
[01:20:47] <Eviltwin> You can try using .animate({"height":0}) or something like that instead
[01:21:13] <GoSox> hmmm
[01:21:13] <Eviltwin> Or perpahs .animate({"height":"hide"})
[01:21:18] <GoSox> a good plan for another day
[01:21:19] <Eviltwin> And .animate({"height":"show"})
[01:29:04] <wumpus_> hello guys
[01:29:49] <wumpus_> i have a problem with jQuery.proxy()
[01:29:59] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, still get unefined
[01:30:07] <LukeNukem> undefined*
[01:30:22] <wumpus_> im using it like this : $.proxy(removeBackdrop, this)
[01:30:41] <wumpus_> it works if the tab is on focus
[01:30:49] <wumpus_> but if i open another tab
[01:31:06] <wumpus_> removeBackdrop never get called
[01:31:30] <wumpus_> this happen in firefox
[01:31:48] <wumpus_> on chrome everything is fine even if the tab is not on focus
[01:32:59] <wumpus_> any idea?
[02:26:22] <petermcandrew> hey there,  have a question about getting a PHP array and making it available to to Jquery.
[02:26:45] <gf3> have you tried google?
[02:27:08] <petermcandrew> :)
[03:32:15] <ravenzz> ping :o)
[03:36:40] <wumpus_> guys i have a problem with .one() function
[03:37:09] <wumpus_> im using it this way: elem.one(event, handler)
[03:37:32] <wumpus_> it works fine it the tab where the elem is is active
[03:37:56] <wumpus_> if the tab isn't on focus it seems that it doesn't work
[03:38:04] <wumpus_> this happen on firefox
[03:38:22] <t0lkman> why are u using one?
[03:38:32] <wumpus_> it's not a my problem
[03:38:36] <t0lkman> it's probably two events are happening
[03:38:43] <t0lkman> one is on focus, second is on click
[03:38:49] <wumpus_> it's twitter bootstrap modal
[03:38:52] <t0lkman> your second event is being ignored
[03:39:03] <t0lkman> which is onclick
[03:39:41] <wumpus_> take a look here
[03:39:43] <wumpus_> https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/js/bootstrap-modal.js
[03:39:49] <wumpus_> line 148
[03:40:35] <wumpus_> removeBackdrop() doesn't get called if the tab isnt on focus
[03:41:49] <wumpus_> i open an issue to them
[03:42:05] <wumpus_> but if i can figure myself would be good
[03:45:49] <wumpus_> t0lkman how can i track what events are getting fired?
[03:47:29] <t0lkman> install firequery plugin
[03:47:47] <t0lkman> inspect with firebug this element it will show u what events are currently attached
[03:48:04] <wumpus_> ok
[03:49:43] <krsna> Hey, anybody can help me out with sending jQuery objects over the server to store in the database via socket.io
[03:50:22] <LukeNukem> Hello
[03:50:23] <LukeNukem> http://pastebin.com/7H8hSYLM
[03:50:30] <LukeNukem> im getting undefined when alerting dislikescount
[03:51:18] <t0lkman> https://github.com/williscool/jquery-socket.io
[03:52:15] <krsna> Thank you !
[03:53:14] <t0lkman> Luke
[03:53:20] <t0lkman> use data() instead attr("data-dislikes");
[03:54:22] <LukeNukem> um
[03:54:38] <krsna> t0lkman .. im talking about sending an entire div to the server ..
[03:54:43] <wumpus_> mmm i see no event bound to that element
[03:54:51] <krsna> with all its attributes
[03:54:58] <Qalqi> .load() uses GET requests
[03:55:14] <Qalqi> is there an alternative that uses POST requests
[03:55:16] <Qalqi> ?
[03:55:33] <t0lkman> wumpus you have to select an option to see it
[03:55:35] <LukeNukem> t0lkman, you mean var dislikescount = jQuery("#dislike_link_comment_"+commentid).data("dislikes");
[03:55:44] <t0lkman> I remember it was under console options in firebug
[03:55:49] <t0lkman> show jquery smth
[03:55:51] <wumpus_> checking
[03:56:00] <t0lkman> Luke est
[03:56:09] <t0lkman> LukeNukem yes
[03:57:00] <t0lkman> wumpus take a look an example http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3960709/inspect-an-element-to-investigate-jquery-event-bindings
[03:57:43] <krsna> I need to send an entire div like this : var x=$('#div');  socket.emit('someThing',x)
[03:57:54] <LukeNukem> t0lkman, undefined
[03:58:31] <t0lkman> LukeNukem what do you have in your html
[03:58:41] <t0lkman> also try to alert commentid'
[03:58:53] <t0lkman> also try to alert 'commentid' to make sure it contains a value
[03:59:27] <LukeNukem> yes, it contains a value
[04:00:31] <t0lkman> maybe your html doesn't have data-dislikes values?
[04:02:15] <LukeNukem> http://jsfiddle.net/mNdLz/
[04:06:34] <t0lkman> i think it happanes because dom is not ready
[04:06:40] <t0lkman> when u trying to click
[04:13:48] <LukeNukem> t0lkman, you mean #dislike_link_comment_commentid
[04:13:49] <LukeNukem> right
[04:16:53] <t0lkman> I see also commentid is not defined
[04:17:01] <LukeNukem> commentid is defined
[04:17:12] <t0lkman> when I replace var commentid = jQuery(this).attr("data-id");
[04:17:13] <LukeNukem> i can alter that and it works fine
[04:17:17] <t0lkman> to var commentid = 4;
[04:17:21] <t0lkman> looks like everything is working
[04:17:33] <LukeNukem> commentid comes from php so no worries there and it works fine
[04:17:45] <LukeNukem> does dislike_link_comment
[04:17:45] <LukeNukem> work?
[04:18:11] <t0lkman> http://pastebin.com/gSfs4B0u
[04:20:45] <t0lkman> also when you use var dislikescount = jQuery(this).attr("data-dislikes");
[04:21:02] <t0lkman> this reffers to .dislike_link_comment
[04:21:14] <LukeNukem> im doing
[04:21:22] <t0lkman> but in your html you don't have neither .dislike_link_comment nor data-dislikes
[04:21:32] <LukeNukem> jQuery("#dislike_link_comment_4")
[04:22:11] <LukeNukem> data-dislikes='2' data-id='4' class='dislike_link_comment' id='dislike_link_comment_4'
[04:22:16] <LukeNukem> line 18, on your pastebin
[04:22:36] <LukeNukem> im using # selector
[04:22:41] <who_am_i> I can't believe I can't find it...I want to resize div to specific height
[04:23:03] <t0lkman> LukeNukem so your "this" reffers to wrong place try like that: var dislikescount = jQuery('#dislike_link_comment_4').data("dislikes");
[04:23:53] <t0lkman> who_am_i $()
[04:24:03] <t0lkman> who_am_i $('div').height('100px');
[04:24:06] <LukeNukem> _4
[04:24:12] <LukeNukem> that must come from comment_id
[04:24:15] <LukeNukem> commentid*
[04:24:37] <who_am_i> t0lkman: and to add animation to this?
[04:24:37] <t0lkman> LukeNukem i know try first like that if it works
[04:25:04] <xec> ?animate @ who_am_i
[04:25:05] <bot-t> who_am_i, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[04:25:12] <LukeNukem> t0lkman, nope does not work
[04:25:23] <edulterado> hi, this always returns NULL,  $('ul li span[id="$id"]').html('I found you'); despite $id is always an integer, what am I missing?
[04:25:37] <who_am_i> ok, I'll tinker with it
[04:25:37] <who_am_i> thanks
[04:26:01] <LukeNukem> $ = jQuery
[04:26:31] <t0lkman> who_am_i $('div').animate({height:'500px'}, 5000);
[04:26:38] <xec> edulterado: $id is a variable?
[04:26:47] <edulterado> xec: yes, it is
[04:26:56] <wumpus_> t0lkman can i bother you a little more?
[04:27:08] <t0lkman> wumpus_ private
[04:27:16] <xec> edulterado: how about $("#"+$id)
[04:27:47] <xec> edulterado: seeing as IDs are unique i don't see why you would need the rest of the selector
[04:28:10] <xec> ooh
[04:28:18] <xec> its an integer you say
[04:28:28] <xec> you can't have an ID that starts with a number
[04:28:57] <LukeNukem> t0lkman, cmooon..help me :D
[04:28:58] <LukeNukem> T_T
[04:29:06] <eirikb> Hello. Is it possible to chain .map with .join? I tried it here: http://jsfiddle.net/T3MgM but .join is not a method
[04:29:51] <edulterado> xec: you´re right, I guess that must be the problem
[04:29:58] <eirikb> Guess I can wrap in $.makeArray, not pretty
[04:30:15] <eirikb> As in: http://jsfiddle.net/T3MgM/1
[04:31:25] <xec> eirikb: there's a difference between $.map() and $(selector).map() -- only the first variation will return an array
[04:31:39] <edulterado> xec: anyway, your approach worked fine $("#" + $id)
[04:32:18] <eirikb> xec: I'm guessing that $(selector).map returns a jQuery object, and that does not have join. Which is fair enough, but should it not have it?
[04:32:51] <t0lkman> LukeNukem send me your latest code on pastebin
[04:33:23] <xec> eirikb: it doesn't make too much sense to .join() jQuery/DOM objects, i guess
[04:33:40] <xec> what would it do
[04:34:11] <eirikb> That's true. I didn't get $.map to work on first try
[04:34:16] <eirikb> http://jsfiddle.net/T3MgM/2/
[04:35:30] <eirikb> Guess I still need to wrap in $.makeArray, but now only the selection

[04:48:36] <umren> can i use jquery as ajax html parser for data?
[04:49:53] <LukeNukem> yer
[04:55:12] <umren> LukeNukem u mean yes?
[04:55:34] <Woet> yes, he does
[04:59:01] <petermcandrew> I'm trying to figure out the right syntax to manipulate an object with a dynamic property.  I tried console.log(contact.+contactId) where contact is object and contactId the variable.  What am I doing wrong?

[05:00:33] <FJ1> what do you want to do? change value?
[05:00:41] <Grav> Hi. I have a script that loads jcarousel and then hide tab containing it. It works everywhere but not in ie9. Is it possible that ie9 executes this out of order? It behaves like it hides it first and then can't generate carousel after it.
[05:01:17] <xec> petermcandrew: you mean contactId is name of a property of contact object? if so you can try contact[contactId]
[05:02:02] <FJ1> @petermcandrew:
[05:02:02] <FJ1> contact.mrx = "aaa";
[05:02:02] <FJ1> var contactId = "mrx";

[05:04:36] <Es0teric> how do i use $.getJSON?
[05:04:52] <Es0teric> meaning… how do i use it AFTER i have retrieved the data?
[05:05:08] <FJ1> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[05:05:14] <xec> Es0teric: you know what a callback is?
[05:05:19] <Es0teric> xec no
[05:05:30] <xec> ?ajax101
[05:05:31] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[05:05:58] <Es0teric> ok, xec
[05:06:01] <Skyjoker> grav: https://github.com/jsor/jcarousel/issues/189
[05:06:14] <xec> Es0teric: it's basically a function that gets executed after something has finished, in getJSON's case, when the data is retrieved
[05:06:49] <Es0teric> ok xec, when i get the data and i put it in a variable, lets say var names = data.usernames;
[05:07:05] <Es0teric> xec, how do i make that names var accessible outside of $.getJSON?
[05:07:14] <deanclkclk> hello folks
[05:07:18] <deanclkclk> I have a question
[05:07:48] <deanclkclk> in firebug...i have the jquery base and ui but, in the firebug console...when I type "$.accordion" I get undefine
[05:07:51] <Grav> Skyjoker: but it is working in ie9, but i must to hide tab containing it. And IE9 loads in different order, or i don't know.
[05:09:19] <LukeNukem> can someone help me with this
[05:09:19] <LukeNukem> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9349202/undefined-error-when-using-data-attribute-with-jquery
[05:09:33] <xec> Es0teric: you don't have access to any data from getJSON until the request is done, obviously - so anything that depends on that data needs to be done either in the callback (or after the callback has fired) and as such it doesnt make much sense to create a var outside it. you can also read up on promises and deferreds
[05:09:44] <xec> Es0teric: but take a look at the links bot-t gave you
[05:10:43] <Es0teric> xec, i am not trying to create the var outside $.getJSON, i created it INSIDE $.getJSON and the data is in a php page that echos out json_encode() so i can plainly see the data if i go to the page
[05:11:06] <xec> ?demo @ Es0teric
[05:11:06] <bot-t> Es0teric, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:11:38] <Es0teric> xec, its a question… not a problem yet - i know i am doing something wrong
[05:12:14] <xec> showing what you've tried might help us understand where you went wrong ;)
[05:13:14] <Es0teric> xec, i do this… $.getJSON('app/path/to/php/file/with/json/data', function(data) { var names = data.usernames; //this is not accessible outside this function.. })
[05:13:34] <Es0teric> xec, but when i do alert(names); inside that function, it alerts with the data
[05:14:45] <xec> okay
[05:15:07] <xec> why "but" - isn't this what you expect/want?
[05:17:02] <Es0teric> xec, why would i want that?.. i wouldnt be able to use the result in other functions… like if i want to do an autocomplete with the names that were retrieved i wouldnt be able to do that
[05:18:47] <xec> Es0teric: these other functions you speak of, could be called inside the callback, with some data passed, for instance
[05:19:23] <Es0teric> xec, you arent answering my question… my question is - how do i make that data available to other functions?
[05:20:15] <xec> $.getJSON("url", function(d){ otherFunction(d.names) })
[05:20:37] <xec> inside otherFunction you now got access to the names
[05:20:52] <Es0teric> xec, so i cannot make a variable tahts accessible?
[05:21:20] <xec> yes you can, but it will not be available until the callback is fired, so it doesn't make too much sense
[05:23:01] <Es0teric> so then xec, when a callback is fired… what is a callback?
[05:23:51] <xec> callback is the function that is executed when the http request is done
[05:25:13] <Es0teric> xec, i see..
[05:25:21] <Es0teric> WTF
[05:27:15] <Es0teric> xec -> http://pastie.org/private/qjbbxqyjhcmfgbo3ywheaa
[05:27:18] <Es0teric> thats my problem right now
[05:27:57] <xec> Es0teric: are you using the jquery ui autocomplete plugin?
[05:28:04] <Es0teric> xec, yes
[05:28:39] <xec> you don't need getJSON i think
[05:28:40] <xec> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote
[05:29:01] <Es0teric> xec, its still useful for me to know how to use getJSON… so how do i fix that problem?
[05:29:27] <xec> Es0teric: do you know what an object literal is?
[05:29:34] <Es0teric> xec, yes
[05:30:09] <xec> .autocomplete() takes an object literal as argument. inside this object you seem to have slapped a console.log?
[05:30:58] <Es0teric> oh
[05:30:59] <Es0teric> snap
[05:31:38] <Es0teric> xec, i thought you can put things between object literals..
[05:31:46] <Es0teric> like you could with switch/case
[05:32:48] <Joeytje50> hey, is there a way to do $('element').is('#id').html('newHTML') or something?
[05:33:17] <Joeytje50> to change all elements that are tagname element and id #id?
[05:34:21] <xec> Joeytje50: why don't you just select #id right away. is() will return a boolean
[05:35:39] <xec> you might be looking for .filter() if your example was silly ;)
[05:36:24] <Joeytje50> ah thanks xec

[06:01:34] <LukeNukem> T_T
[06:04:32] <xec> LukeNukem: remove all unnecessary clutter and make a working demo, explain exactly what is happening and what you expect. then maybe someone will bother
[06:06:03] <LukeNukem> xec, i cant make a demo out of that page because what im trying to work with comes from an ajax request and its not included in the page source code
[06:06:18] <xec> use dummy datra
[06:06:21] <xec> -r
[06:06:26] <LukeNukem> okl
[06:06:28] <LukeNukem> ok*

[06:09:07] <LukeNukem> wait
[06:09:44] <xec> this is your clutter free code? -.-
[06:10:04] <who_am_i> I'm calling .animate({width: something}) on a div
[06:10:22] <who_am_i> it works mostly fine, but I'd like it to "grow" or shrink on only one side
[06:11:12] <xec> who_am_i: let me guess. the div is centered?
[06:11:13] <LukeNukem> im removing it all
[06:11:17] <LukeNukem> and i think i know what hte problem is
[06:11:55] <who_am_i> xec: not really...it's on the right of another div, which I'm simultaneously shrinking
[06:12:06] <xec> LukeNukem: step 1: validate your html
[06:12:19] <who_am_i> so the one on the left shrinks, the one on the right grows in place of the other one
[06:12:38] <xec> ?demo @ who_am_i
[06:12:38] <bot-t> who_am_i, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:13:15] <who_am_i> jsfiddle, sure
[06:14:50] <michelem> hello folks
[06:17:42] <wayne> hello
[06:24:08] <who_am_i> xec: nevermind I guess, setting: "float: right;" on the right container solved it
[06:24:35] * K3|Chris mutters "tables"
[06:25:46] <who_am_i> now another question. I'd like to "synchronize" two animations, both are simple resizing
[06:26:12] <who_am_i> let's suppose I want to resize div1 from 300px to 0px, and div to from 600px to 900px
[06:26:33] <who_am_i> how can I make sure "sum" of px is 900px, at every moment?
[06:27:25] <K3|Chris> step it one px at a time in a loop? not sure
[06:27:35] <K3|Chris> I've had a similar issue
[06:27:48] <K3|Chris> I did a quick fix by giving them a couple px breathing room
[06:28:13] <who_am_i> no clean solution there I guess :/
[06:28:40] <WesleyL> if the difference in px is equal, the length of the animation is equal and the easing is linear it should already stay at 900px right?
[06:28:42] <K3|Chris> there might be, but I don't know of it, but I'm not very experienced
[06:28:48] <xec> you might be able to have it "close enough" if you always start with the shrinking div first
[06:28:51] <K3|Chris> WesleyL: no
[06:29:09] <K3|Chris> xec: give the shrinking one a couple ms headstart?
[06:29:32] <K3|Chris> or shorten it's animation time
[06:29:46] <who_am_i> I've shortened animation time
[06:29:57] <who_am_i> but it doesn't look that good
[06:30:47] <K3|Chris> could probably dial it in a bit to make it less noticable
[06:34:17] <xec> K3|Chris, who_am_i: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCER2/
[06:35:28] <K3|Chris> hmm, looks to be synced
[06:36:07] <xec> if I do it the other way, .one first, sometimes the sum is more than 600px and you get a red flash
[06:39:48] <xec> this is better but i doubt ie7 will like it: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCER2/1/
[06:40:00] <who_am_i> xec: what you're basically saying, start shrinking first
[06:40:26] <xec> yeah, that was the theory
[06:40:55] <xec> although i ran it a couple times and red flash happens with shrinking first too, so it's not a solution :P
[06:41:23] <who_am_i> xec: I see that now too, on my site
[06:41:57] <who_am_i> maybe there is some simple css way to allow overlapping divs, other than table-cell?
[06:42:09] <K3|Chris> pos abs
[06:42:12] <xec> ye
[06:43:36] <xec> that can work http://jsfiddle.net/ZCER2/2/

[07:04:57] <black_warlock> http://www.eyecon.ro/datepicker/
[07:05:08] <black_warlock> i m using the last script exemple
[07:05:20] <black_warlock> i dont get how i can send that range inside an input
[07:11:27] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/8xrvF/
[07:11:47] <black_warlock> who can help me ?
[07:12:46] <xec> your javascript field appears empty?
[07:13:46] <black_warlock> it is
[07:13:50] <black_warlock> its all inside the script
[07:13:58] <K3|Chris> ...
[07:14:00] <black_warlock> but the script compiling a Div
[07:14:32] <black_warlock> precisely a <span></span> inside a particular div
[07:14:39] <black_warlock> to print the date
[07:14:41] <michelem> is .css() cumulative?
[07:14:44] <xec> black_warlock: looks like you can supply a function to onChange option
[07:15:16] <xec> michelem: in what sense - it will overwrite existing properties and add non-existing
[07:15:18] <michelem> does myvar.css(top: x); myvar.css(left: y) set both top and left, or top gets reset?
[07:15:38] <xec> ?tias @ michelem
[07:15:38] <bot-t> michelem, Try It And See
[07:15:53] <michelem> xec: that's a stupid advice.
[07:16:11] <xec> how on earth is that stupid
[07:16:17] <black_warlock> sec
[07:16:19] <michelem> xec: if it's not in the docs, the behavior can be changed next version.
[07:16:59] <michelem> there's specs and there's implementation. Users should refer to specs, not implementation.
[07:17:00] <xec> michelem: i already gave you the answer. why would it overwrite other properties?
[07:17:16] <michelem> xec: thanks.
[07:21:23] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/8xrvF/3/
[07:21:53] <black_warlock> do you think is it possible to split the date into 2 strings and put em in the relative fields ?
[07:22:36] <tristan-> does anyone know a good tooltip plugin?
[07:22:43] <tristan-> been trying a few out but they're buggy.

[07:23:16] <black_warlock> i know one
[07:23:21] <black_warlock> very good and simple
[07:23:24] <black_warlock> a sec
[07:23:27] <tristan-> oh sweet
[07:23:29] <tristan-> thank warlock
[07:23:30] <tristan-> s
[07:23:42] <tristan-> was gunna try this one: http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/index.html
[07:23:52] <tristan-> but will certainly take your word for it if u have exp with one already
[07:24:02] <tristan-> lightweight and functional.

[07:25:28] <bot-t> xec: 3
[07:25:32] <xec> just saying
[07:25:33] <LukeNukem> whats context
[07:26:06] <tristan-> woah, nice warlock
[07:26:15] <black_warlock> in the tooltip i' ve linked , you can just set the content in a span
[07:26:25] <black_warlock> and can be also html
[07:26:27] <tristan-> i love this
[07:26:32] <tristan-> clean and lots of options.
[07:26:37] <black_warlock> yus
[07:26:45] <black_warlock> i have tried about 10 tooltips
[07:26:48] <black_warlock> or moar
[07:26:52] <black_warlock> this is the best
[07:26:52] <tristan-> black_warlock: http://heers.holmberg.ca
[07:26:52] <Fox`> has anyone seen a plugin which would allow you to zoom out? I'm trying to create the same illusion as this, but in js http://htwins.net/scale2/
[07:27:01] <LukeNukem> var newdislikescount = parseInt(dislikescount) + 1;
[07:27:08] <sweb> jsonp header must be 'application/json' ?
[07:27:10] <LukeNukem> dislikescount = 2
[07:27:19] <tristan-> been working on that, bought 30 hours in, going to clean up redudant code, and still need to ajaxify the html bits, but tell me what you think if u want.
[07:27:49] <LukeNukem> someone tell me why i get NaN as result
[07:28:33] <black_warlock> nice website tristan-
[07:28:52] <xec> ?eval var dislikescount = 2; parseInt(dislikescount) + 1
[07:28:53] <bot-t> xec: 3
[07:29:20] <xec> LukeNukem: you're lying! :)
[07:29:28] <LukeNukem> i swear i got NaN
[07:29:34] <Fox`> also, why does it say the usa is as big as the moon? lol
[07:29:38] <xec> i don't doubt it
[07:29:48] <black_warlock> i can give you the css modified by me to make the tooltip more beautiful
[07:29:55] <tristan-> please do!
[07:30:02] <LukeNukem> xec, dislikescount actually comes from a data attribute
[07:30:03] <tristan-> it's going to go in the 'our people' seciton
[07:30:08] <LukeNukem> its 2, in this case
[07:30:20] <tristan-> ie, you hover over a mugshot, and a tooltip will appear describing their role at the company.
[07:30:24] <xec> LukeNukem: and you're sure you're getting 2 from it?
[07:30:41] <tristan-> jquery makes my life better :D
[07:30:45] <LukeNukem> xec, yes
[07:30:57] <xec> LukeNukem: this is easy to test in a jsfiddle - if you get the same error there, share it
[07:30:58] <LukeNukem> why am i getting a NaN
[07:32:21] <Fox`> everyone has a nan
[07:32:52] <divout> LukeNukem: you'll get NaN only if dislikescount = 'isString'
[07:33:09] <divout> ?eval parseInt('string') + 1;
[07:33:09] <bot-t> divout: NaN
[07:35:25] <divout> ?eval parseInt(NaN) + 1;
[07:35:25] <bot-t> divout: NaN
[07:35:41] <divout> ?eval parseInt([]) + 1;
[07:35:42] <bot-t> divout: NaN
[07:35:46] <divout> ?eval parseInt({}) + 1;
[07:35:47] <bot-t> divout: NaN
[07:40:56] <LukeNukem> funny
[07:41:01] <LukeNukem> dislikescount var was working 10 mins ago
[07:41:02] <LukeNukem> and now its not

[08:49:09] <nail_> http://jsfiddle.net/8xrvF/6/ that's probably a better base to work on, but that plugin seems bogus
[08:51:31] <black_warlock> it was so cool to select the range
[08:51:37] <black_warlock> =(
[08:53:05] <black_warlock> hum your script doesnt work :D
[08:53:51] <nail_> i didn't do anything, it's this plugin that seems to be full of hate
[08:56:03] <nail_> there are a few examples of range selection using the jquery ui datepicker
[08:58:54] <mathi> hi
[08:59:52] <pifantastic> there is a great jquery ui datepicker demo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#date-range
[09:00:27] <mathi> what is the best way to get an element by its ID in the case I know it's a direct child? I can do $(data).find('#myId'); but not sure it's the most optimized because it will search through all elements/descendants
[09:00:52] <nail_> $('#myId')
[09:01:09] <mathi> nail_, I should find it in $(data)
[09:01:18] <nail_> it's unique, so it doesn't matter
[09:01:22] <nail_> IS IT?
[09:01:47] <mathi> data contains a string with HTML
[09:01:56] <mathi> I need to find the ID in that string
[09:02:08] <mathi> $(data) <- jquery wrapper of the HTML
[09:02:13] <nail_> ah right
[09:03:01] <pifantastic> mathi: that should be good
[09:03:06] <pifantastic> jquery creates a document fragment
[09:03:13] <pifantastic> which I think supports getElementById
[09:03:39] <mathi> pifantastic, sure, but then the question, what is the most optimized method to find the ID, if I know that it is a direct child
[09:03:52] <pifantastic> mathi: getElementById is the most optimized
[09:04:11] <Eviltwin> mathi: There's no selector that's more optimized than getting an element by ID
[09:06:18] <mathi> pifantastic, how would I use getElementById?
[09:06:28] <pifantastic> mathi: dont worry about it
[09:06:31] <pifantastic> jquery will
[09:06:40] <pifantastic> when you call find() with an ID selector
[09:07:37] <black_warlock> wow loveble data picker pifantastic
[09:11:52] <goose84> Has anyone seen Jquery animate sliding of a draw opening
[09:12:05] <Eviltwin> Do you mean drawer?
[09:12:10] <goose84> yea
[09:12:33] <Eviltwin> Most of us aren't from Boston
[09:12:44] <goose84> I am from the UK
[09:13:01] <wookiehangover> goose84: I would have guessed you're from Top Gun
[09:13:06] <john-dev> hey, i am using jquery ui (animate) to remove a content from the page to make the background visibible. Actually everything is working just fine, just the performance is that huge that the effect shutters. Are there any known tricks to make a smoother animate left?
[09:13:30] <goose84> haha no otherwise I would be deasd
[09:13:33] <goose84> dead*
[09:17:20] <goose84> http://goo.gl/gBbyT this is the drawer
[09:17:33] <goose84> is it possible to get jquery to do the hover smoothly
[09:18:55] <john-dev> well, using backgroundPosition
[09:19:01] <john-dev> but your image need to be prepared for that
[09:19:07] <john-dev> huge task..
[09:19:11] <nail_> using stop motion
[09:20:18] <goose84> ok can you point me in the right direction for either?
[09:20:22] <Eviltwin> Wait, you mean like literal drawers?
[09:20:31] <john-dev> like that.. http://www.littlebubble.com/wearedigital/ShoeSpinner/
[09:20:36] <john-dev> hover the image*
[09:20:48] <john-dev> you need to provide a picture for everyframe..
[09:21:08] <john-dev> you usualy use flash for that..
[09:21:23] <john-dev> usually*
[09:22:11] <Eviltwin> I think this might be possible but I think you're going to need it in two pieces
[09:22:28] <Eviltwin> Maybe not
[09:22:44] <Eviltwin> You'd probably want z-indexes
[09:22:59] <goose84> yea the z-indexes arent working
[09:23:02] <Eviltwin> Make the outer ones be in a lower layer
[09:23:11] <Eviltwin> The second-to-outer ones be higher
[09:23:16] <Eviltwin> And the middle one to be the highest
[09:23:22] <john-dev> well, z-index is as you wrote an index, not an axis..
[09:23:38] <john-dev> jquery can't interpolate picture's, so you need to provide those anyway, nomatter which metho you choose
[09:24:26] <john-dev> you could use a *.gif aswell
[09:24:55] <goose84> ok so to make it smooth its going to be a chore
[09:25:24] <goose84> dunno why the indexing isnt working though
[09:26:17] <goose84> as the closed draws have -1 and the open has 9999
[09:26:25] <joshsmith> how can I listen on a click on every element in the document *except* a particular element
[09:26:32] <john-dev> to find that out you need to provide us with some code, but since older browser's doesn't support z-index, you might shouldn't use it
[09:27:16] <john-dev> joshsmith, give them all the same class, except the one you don't want to trigger
[09:27:32] <joshsmith> I know there's another way to do it
[09:27:38] <joshsmith> binding to the document and excluding the class
[09:27:39] <goose84> all the code is here http://goo.gl/gBbyT
[09:27:41] <joshsmith> I just can't remember how
[09:28:17] <john-dev> $('*:not(.class)').click(function() {
[09:29:02] <joshsmith> or I could attach a handler to the document and do e.stopPropagation inside the other handler
[09:29:19] <john-dev> you need to identify it anyway..
[09:31:28] <bonhoffer> i have a date, d, and i want to get the date part and time part as strings, is this well trod ground
[09:34:59] <alaing> hi how can I make jquery UI dialog expand to the size of my content so users do not get a scrollbar or have to resize the dialog
[09:35:02] <joshsmith> bonhoffer: http://momentjs.com/
[09:35:15] <bonhoffer> nice
[09:35:18] <ortix> how do i use the slideUp() function on a single row inside a table? I can't give them separate id's because they are generated with a foreach loop
[09:35:42] <joshsmith> ortix: do you know its position?
[09:35:43] <ortix> i have this: $K2('tr#row').slideUp();
[09:36:09] <ortix> yes there is a unique itemid stored in each row
[09:36:19] <joshsmith> what is supposed to be triggering the slideUp()?
[09:36:31] <ortix> a success after an ajax request
[09:36:39] <ortix> ajax request is triggered by pressing a button inside that row
[09:36:57] <ortix> http://animekyun.com/component/option,com_k2report/Itemid,238/view,list/ is the live site
[09:36:57] <joshsmith> then you can just cache $(this) and find the appropriate parent
[09:37:17] <ortix> i have to add that i am very new to jquery
[09:37:27] <ortix> so i have no clue what that means :')
[09:37:37] <ortix> and guests can't see the button (only admins)
[09:38:12] <joshsmith> $(this).parent() gets the immediate parent of whatever element you're at currently
[09:38:12] <Ajdare> Bet and Win with us : http://bet-tips.cogia.net/?ref=285
[09:38:30] <joshsmith> btw, you have multiple IDs
[09:38:34] <joshsmith> that's just wrong
[09:38:46] <joshsmith> don't put id="row" multiple times
[09:38:54] <joshsmith> an id is an unique identifier
[09:39:05] <ortix> yeah i forgot to take that out
[09:39:06] <joshsmith> you want class="row", if anything
[09:39:22] <ortix> yeah i don't need it at all that was in there for a test (to remove that row)
[09:39:25] <ortix> thanks for the heads up!
[09:39:47] <joshsmith> what you want is $(this).parent().parent().slideUp()
[09:40:01] <joshsmith> er, one more .parent() in there
[09:40:09] <ortix> aha i'll put it in! :D
[09:40:13] <joshsmith> that'll get you the tr
[09:40:17] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: see ?closest
[09:40:17] <bot-t> joshsmith, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[09:40:31] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: thank you!
[09:40:40] <joshsmith> I asked someone a long time ago about the inverse of .find()
[09:41:06] <joshsmith> I figured there was a way to avoid continually daisy-chaining the hell out of .parent()
[09:44:12] <Remaille> hi, i would like to add a simple hide() on a mouseout event, nothing difficult, but...
[09:44:14] <alaing> hi how can I make jquery UI dialog expand to the size of my content so users do not get a scrollbar or have to resize the dialog
[09:44:28] <Remaille> please have a look at : http://linuxedu.tetaneutral.net/~linuxeduportail/
[09:44:37] <Remaille> top left bloc -> problem
[09:44:42] <Remaille> top right -> ok
[09:44:49] <Remaille> I don't understand why....
[09:49:36] <tristan-> is it possible to have a span.text() get updated to reflect the path of the current asset(s) being loaded?
[09:49:49] <tristan-> ie, my ajax spinner tends to hang on google assets that get loaded
[09:49:58] <tristan-> and it would be really nice to reflect that to the user.
[09:50:45] <ortix> joshsmith: sorry to be such a pain but i don't quite understand what that parent().parent().parent(). does.. it doesn't work either
[09:51:06] <joshsmith> see what Eviltwin said above
[09:51:59] <ortix> ooh let me check thatout! :D
[09:52:31] <jnettik> so I'm having a problem with jquery's .animate() method and ie7. I'm changing the 'top' value on hover which works in every browser but ie7. anyone have any advice?
[10:13:14] <black_warlock> guys sombody knows how to add time to the datepicker ui ?
[10:13:33] <black_warlock> i have tried dateFormat:'dd/mm/yy hh:mm:ss',
[10:13:47] <nail_> black_warlock: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[10:15:18] <black_warlock> oh gosh
[10:18:32] <airdem> http://pastebin.com/4GnpmR40 how can i execute the check function at init?
[10:18:44] <airdem> line 27
[10:19:38] <ortix> i'm back with another problem :')
[10:20:54] <ortix> so i have a table and a button in every row. Once the button is pressed, it sends a ajax request to the server to delete the contents of that table in the database
[10:20:56] <ortix> however
[10:21:06] <ortix> it seems that the ajax request keeps deleting the FIRST row :(
[10:21:08] <ortix> http://pastebin.com/T8KZU2XS
[10:21:13] <ortix> my script
[10:21:25] <ortix> i'm figuring i have to use the parent() function but i'm not quite sure how or where
[10:21:54] <ortix> http://animekyun.com/component/option,com_k2report/Itemid,238/view,list/ is the actual table
[10:25:04] <raywan> How do you monitor if an elements value is changed by a non user action? (eg. another js function)
[10:25:07] <nail_> ortix: supposing your button is inside the form, $(this).parent().serialize(), and don't use the same id multiple times
[10:25:14] <Eviltwin> raywan: You can't
[10:25:19] <Eviltwin> raywan: It would create a performance nightmare
[10:25:36] <ortix> yes sir! :D
[10:25:51] <raywan> :/ so only user changes are monitored
[10:26:41] <ortix> oh praise the lord it worked :')
[10:27:00] <raywan> how could I work around this? There is a js function thats changing the value of a textfield and I want an action to trigger on that change
[10:27:16] <Eviltwin> raywan: It's like saying I'd like to be told when I say something
[10:27:51] <raywan> Eviltwin, am not in control of this other function
[10:28:17] <Eviltwin> That's your fault
[10:28:33] <raywan> How is that my fault?
[10:29:11] <nail_> you could maybe oldfunc = thatfunc; thatfunc = function() { oldfunc(); $(document).trigger('thatfunchasbeencalled'); }
[10:29:14] <ortix> hower i still can't get the row to slide up. I'm using this now uppon succes:
[10:29:16] <nail_> and bind something to that event
[10:29:16] <ortix> $K2(this).closest('tr').slideUp();
[10:29:37] <Eviltwin> $K2?
[10:29:43] <ortix> $(this) should get the current element and the closest('tr') should get that tr
[10:29:49] <ortix> yeah it was conflicting with mootools
[10:29:57] <ortix> so i had to use an override
[10:30:17] <Eviltwin> And you picked $K2?
[10:30:35] <ortix> well the K2 override is already loaded when the page loads
[10:30:43] <ortix> from the K2 component for joomla
[10:30:58] <ortix> didn't want to innitiate ANOTHER override
[10:32:00] <ortix> i can try with parent()
[10:34:16] <ortix> no luck with parent.. :(
[10:37:04] <scar2> is there a jquery class that will grab unique values from a table's columns and let you "filter" with dropdowns? i see a table sortable that lets you sort by column already?
[10:37:39] <Eviltwin> Class?
[10:41:49] <ElGoorf> does ie handle $.ajax differently to chrome/ff?
[10:42:44] <kristofer91> Hey guys, i'm having trouble figuring out what to use, i have 3 div's that are always in the same position in the footer of the site, but on different page i want them to be like on the home page showing 50% of the div and when hovered it shows it entirely, on the news page for exemple it's 20
[10:42:52] <kristofer91> %shown, and on hover it shows entirely
[10:43:07] <black_warlock> uff this datepicker is all fuked up
[10:44:19] <black_warlock> range doesnt work
[10:44:30] <black_warlock> it blocks the right range
[10:44:40] <black_warlock> and cant set the lang properly
[10:50:59] <black_warlock> hell i wish to add just a datepicker and with this ui its terrible
[10:51:07] <black_warlock> too many shets inside
[10:59:46] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/8xrvF/16/
[11:00:00] <black_warlock> can sombody tell me how do i set italian format ?
[11:00:26] <black_warlock> and why the date range blocks  ?
[11:01:13] <black_warlock> if i select feb 1st in the 2nd field the calendar appear blocked
[11:01:26] <Eviltwin> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#date-formats
[11:01:37] <Eviltwin> Try reading the options there
[11:03:24] <black_warlock> i ve setted the format
[11:03:36] <black_warlock> but looks like it bugs all the script
[11:03:56] <black_warlock> try to push 1st feb on the first field (from)
[11:04:07] <black_warlock> and then check (to)
[11:04:12] <black_warlock> 2nd field
[11:04:17] <black_warlock> its blocked
[11:04:54] <black_warlock> bah
[11:09:09] <black_warlock> incredible
[11:09:12] <black_warlock> lol
[11:10:52] <juho3> 58.w 11
[11:10:53] <juho3> oops
[11:11:40] <black_warlock> its freakling bugged this ui
[11:31:56] <fraxture> can/should jquery code that adds document.ready functions be included as an external file?
[11:33:53] <john-dev> fraxture, sure
[11:34:22] <fraxture> i'm getting an error when i do so that it's not recognizing the $...
[11:34:35] <fraxture> perhaps that means I just need to replace the $ with jQuery
[11:34:36] <fraxture> ?
[11:34:57] <john-dev> did you include jquery first?
[11:35:08] <john-dev> the jQuery instead of $ is only need in no conflict mode
[11:36:25] <fraxture> john-dev: yep jquery is being loaded
[11:36:38] <fraxture> but i'm working inside wordpress
[11:36:41] <fraxture> perhaps that is why?
[11:36:51] <john-dev> probably..
[11:37:02] <john-dev> try jQuery
[11:37:38] <ElGoorf> cant believe how much of today i wasted figuring out that IE doesnt support $.ajax
[11:37:39] <ElGoorf> >.<
[11:37:50] <john-dev> ElGoorf, which version? :P
[11:37:53] <fraxture> that worked
[11:38:16] <john-dev> fraxture, so worpress does add a noconflict mode, i guess somehwere
[11:38:17] <fraxture> john-dev, is it possible for your to explain what's happenin?  i dont' totally underastand.
[11:38:31] <fraxture> what is this non-conflict mode
[11:38:51] <john-dev> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[11:40:39] <fraxture> thx
[11:40:43] <john-dev> you are welcome
[11:41:25] <scar2> what type of data is sent to the callbackfunction undr 'success' param for $.ajax with $.post
[11:41:35] <john-dev> scar2, html
[11:41:59] <scar2> john-dev: so the html output of lets say a .php script when performing a post request with ajax?
[11:42:23] <scar2> is thre a BASIC example of how to use ajax with a post and how it handles data?
[11:42:27] <john-dev> scar2, unless you change it, yes.. you can also reply as json and xml
[11:43:11] <john-dev> Take a look at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:43:22] <scar2> john-dev: i want someone to click a link "add", it send a post request to php file, then if its SUCCESSFUL in posting the data (updating a session var), then i want it to tell the browser to run a function that replaces the link that triggered the ajax into text that says "Added"
[11:43:43] <john-dev> easy task ;)
[11:44:13] <scar2> yeah i knwo but i just dont grasp the ajax jquery concept. maybe if there was a short example. ive never found one that wasnt too advanced
[11:44:24] <john-dev> you can use a callback var in the callback onSuccess function, you can handle it however you like it
[11:44:28] <scar2> maybe ill check out w3c-- even tho its overall crappy, it usually has dumbed down 101 examples lol
[11:45:21] <scar2> like, how do i get a link to be triggered with ajax? using an id onclick maybe?
[11:45:27] <john-dev> check out the pages i just posted, it fives you any info you need
[11:45:52] <john-dev> scar2, you should bin an .on('click' event to the "button"
[11:45:55] <john-dev> bind*
[11:46:04] <john-dev> di you know how to use jquery?
[11:46:07] <john-dev> do*
[11:46:20] <scar2> yes and no. i use it when i need to dabble. ive used with like dialog popup windows and such
[11:46:26] <scar2> and used jquery plugins such as accordion,etc
[11:46:47] <john-dev> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:46:50] <john-dev> that's what you need
[11:46:58] <john-dev> it's a basic bind you need to use
[11:47:34] <scar2> im wondering. whats the diff betwen .ajax and .post ?
[11:48:14] <john-dev> $.post is a shorthand way of using $.ajax for POST requests
[11:48:26] <john-dev> $.ajax is generally better to use if you require a greater depth of configuration over your ajax request
[11:48:33] <scar2> john-dev: i have a table like this.. http://srg.apt25.net/sort/9000-series/
[11:48:50] <scar2> john-dev: next to each item will be  a + or Add... how do i get a variable or ID sent with the request so it knows which product to add?
[11:49:11] <john-dev> sorry, i help with code, i don't write it..
[11:49:27] <john-dev> but as i said, .on('click'.. is what you need
[11:49:50] <scar2> john-dev: yes i get that. im just used to PHP and i know how to set a class selector to the link, but how to attach a product variable to it? like do i need to set the id to it and somehow grab the value of the id when sending the request?
[11:49:59] <john-dev> use the items "id" or "class" attribute.. you can raither add your own
[11:50:26] <scar2> like using class="addprod" - .addprod as the selector, and use id="prod_id" and send the id with it? i just dunno how jquery lets me send that value. i dunno.
[11:50:40] <scar2> seems easier for me to use a regular get request lol... haha
[11:50:47] <scar2> post or get really, dont mata!
[11:50:48] <john-dev> $('.class').on('click, function() {….
[11:51:07] <scar2> john-dev: yes i know how to create selectors like that. ive done it with dialog windows, etc
[11:51:19] <scar2> john-dev: but SENDING the ID of that object that was clicked with the CLASS selector
[11:51:44] <john-dev> .attr('id')
[11:51:58] <john-dev> read the jquery page i posted above..
[11:52:17] <john-dev> i bet you never even opened the link up to now..
[11:53:37] <scar2> john-dev: actually, yes i did.
[11:53:43] <scar2> but thanks anyway for being rude.
[11:54:09] <john-dev> as i said, use .attr('id') to get the id of an object
[11:54:16] <scar2> john-dev: i did not see that. i apologize.
[11:54:51] <john-dev> no problem :-)
[11:55:42] <scar2> for some reason, i cant grasp js/jquery as easily bc i dont really use it, however i know once the lightbulb hits, it will
[11:55:45] <scar2> its just so diff from PHP
[11:55:54] <scar2> john-dev: and i have the problem of if JS is not enabled
[11:57:10] <john-dev> scar2, you need to add a fallback if you are really willing to help ppl without js (2% or so)..
[11:57:18] <john-dev> use a normal form as fallback..
[11:57:42] <scar2> john-dev: a no-script ?
[11:57:45] <scar2> <noscript>
[11:57:46] <scar2> haha
[11:57:50] <scar2> i feel like im in 1990 again
[11:57:53] <scar2> 1990s**
[11:58:31] <john-dev> for example yes
[11:58:45] <scar2> ill look into modern methods of displaying non-js pages
[11:59:39] <john-dev> add a normal html form and use jquery with a preventDefault to use jquery instead of html form when available
[12:01:12] <scar2> john-dev: ahh... so make it ancient with html form, but have jquery make it go away if jquery is avail? (pretty much, at least.. i realize i may not be saying it "correctly")
[12:01:25] <john-dev> thats correct :-)
[12:01:36] <john-dev> most ppl do no more add fallbacks btw!
[12:02:06] <scar2> bc 2% is not important? lol
[12:02:13] <john-dev> wlel, that was a guess
[12:02:22] <john-dev> i dont know the real amount..
[12:08:47] <john-dev> hm, good guess http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/stats-no-javascript.html
[12:16:58] <K3|Chris> john-dev: do we need to care about people that don't use javascript?
[12:17:04] <K3|Chris> do we need to care about people that use IE6?
[12:17:09] <K3|Chris> they're far more numerous
[12:20:10] <tw2113> and even ie6 is in death throes
[12:20:26] <tw2113> except in china
[12:20:30] <K3|Chris> well MS is tying to kill it
[12:20:45] <K3|Chris> tw2113: mostly because of older XP machines and all online banking requiring IE6 activex
[12:21:10] <tw2113> i think MS should throw them banks a bone and offer financial help to get updated
[12:21:18] <tw2113> almost like a tech bailout
[12:22:32] <tw2113> or at least entertain the idea, i wouldn't be able to force them
[12:47:45] <kristofer91> i'm making a div .slideToggle upwards, when your hovering a div
[12:47:51] <kristofer91> problem is as soon as the mouse enter the website
[12:47:56] <kristofer91> it slides up
[12:48:17] <kristofer91> instead of sliding up when hovering the specified div
[13:00:06] <bjensen> what plugin do people use for client validations of forms now a days? I was looking at live validation.com, but its full of broken links..
[13:00:16] <black_warlock> how can i set data_start = data_end in this script http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/8xrvF/26/
[13:01:34] <dabear> ?google jquery validity @ bjensen
[13:01:36] <bot-t> bjensen, jQuery.validity - http://validity.thatscaptaintoyou.com/
[13:02:59] <bjensen> dabear: but live validation gives you the error messages before you hit the submit button..
[13:03:42] <dabear> you can trigger validation if you want before the button is pressed
[13:06:01] <kristofer91> arrrgh, i can't find why the div is sliding up, when the mouse isn't even on the div that has the triggering for hover
[13:07:12] <someprimetime> was $this->Auth->allow replaced with $this->Auth->authorize() in 2.0

[13:29:06] <subbyyy> hello, anyone can tell me why hover.onmousenter is delayed when i am hovering over a jquery droppable while dragging something? it works fine when im not dragging an item to the droppable
[13:34:11] <michelem> if I declare a "var myfun = function () { … }", then I pass it to .animate(), will myfun be garbage-collected when my function terminates before .animate() does?
[13:34:26] <ag4ve> how do i create an id (or other type of label) with jquery.autocomplete?
[13:41:34] <drakythe> hm... newbie question here, if I'm trying to toggle something based on the .val() of a checkbox, would I make the if statement = true/false or 1/0?
[13:43:50] <markmarkoh> drakythe: you could just leave the equality comparison off and send the value straight to the if statment, like "if ( $box.val() ) {…}"
[13:43:54] <ag4ve> this is what i'm working with: http://scsys.co.uk:8002/182982 passing key/values back doesn't seem to work, but if i just do datum.push( cwJQ(val).text() ) i get part of what i want, but nothing to descriminate from when someone selects.
[13:45:03] <drakythe> markatto: Hm... I don't suppose you have an example handy? I'm still heavily newbish on my jquery
[13:45:05] <ag4ve> drakythe: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/ ?
[13:45:39] <drakythe> ag4ve: correct. I'm toggling a fieldset based on the checkbox
[13:47:22] <ag4ve> duh, missed the checkbox part... yeah, need code, probably $('thing').each( function( i, v ) { this.toggle(); } ); <-- will probably blow up, but an idea
[13:50:16] <kristofer91> i'm going crazy with this hover lol..
[13:50:46] <kristofer91> The div is 50% visible right now, what i want is when hovered. display 100% the div and when mouse leave go back
[13:51:22] <kristofer91> somehow i can't make it work, if i put the div at 50%, the slideToggle, just hides it, i tryed slide up slide down
[13:57:56] <jrockjiggz> kristofer91: try opacity: 50%
[13:59:33] <kristofer91> what do you mean ?
[14:00:20] <sroy2> Hi, does anyone have any advice how to fix this as stated in the comment (without using an extra variable?) http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/22/
[14:00:23] <kristofer91> Right now, i got 3 div's in the footer, there 50% visible, on hover i want the div to slide up the rest of the 50%, so that it becomes fully visible
[14:03:03] <Eviltwin> sroy2: http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/23/
[14:03:31] <sroy2> Eviltwin:  that breaks the submenus...
[14:03:47] <sroy2> and doesn't solve the problem
[14:07:49] <Eviltwin> Sorry, I must have dropped the menu line: http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/25/
[14:08:32] <sroy2> Eviltwin:  still not right, http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/24/ <= that is what I want it to end up being, I was just wondering if there was a way to do it without adding an extra variable.
[14:09:46] <Eviltwin> You just use LI.append(UL) instead of UL.appendTo(LI)
[14:10:21] <Eviltwin> But your LI var actually refers to the A, not the LI
[14:12:01] <Eviltwin> I think you're looking for this: http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/26/
[14:13:39] <Eviltwin> And then...
[14:13:43] <Eviltwin> *drumroll*
[14:13:48] <Eviltwin> Look ma, no vars! http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/27/
[14:14:14] <sroy2> looks right :P
[14:14:18] <Eviltwin> One step further: http://jsfiddle.net/uXww2/28/
[14:14:28] <Eviltwin> Now it's really no vars, not even in the .ready
[14:14:30] <sroy2> now to figure out what that is doing hehe
[14:14:49] <Eviltwin> Right, the problem with no vars is that it becomes very unreadable
[14:15:04] <kristofer91> http://jsfiddle.net/nick_craver/JcBAd/
[14:15:07] <Eviltwin> Which is why I'd recommend the vars and also limiting how far you chain something
[14:15:11] <kristofer91> Can anyone help me on this js
[14:15:24] <sunbeam> how can i make a link open in the next (new) tab?
[14:15:24] <kristofer91> getting the orange part at 50% visible and on hover display 100%
[14:15:26] <sunbeam> when clicked
[14:15:31] <sunbeam> possible with javascript or jquery?
[14:15:39] <sroy2> Eviltwin:  I will take fast over readable, is there a change in performance by using vars?
[14:16:01] <Eviltwin> Not anything you'd ever ntice
[14:16:02] <Eviltwin> notice*
[14:16:11] <someprimetime> yeah
[14:16:16] <someprimetime> the difference will be in ms
[14:16:27] <someprimetime> i'd take readability any day over shaving some ms off some code
[14:16:42] <someprimetime> that way you can pass the project to someone who can understand it
[14:17:12] <sroy2> XD so you don't use the min version of jquery? (just kidding!)
[14:17:13] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: No the difference won't be in ms
[14:17:24] <Eviltwin> The difference will be in µs
[14:17:26] <someprimetime> yeah
[14:17:30] <someprimetime> i don't have the mu in here
[14:17:34] <someprimetime> true
[14:17:46] <Eviltwin> 1 ms != 1 µs
[14:17:54] <someprimetime> turn it upside down
[14:17:56] <someprimetime> :P
[14:18:39] <kristofer91> http://jsfiddle.net/nick_craver/JcBAd/
[14:18:44] <Eviltwin> 1 ms = 1000 µs

[14:26:59] <ag4ve> equivoc: iirc, there's a mobile jq... it was a bit beta a few months ago though
[14:27:39] <equivoc> ag4ve: i know jq mobile, but i would rather not include the whole lib just for this effect

[15:23:35] <yamahaalex37> if I display:none; a checkbox, can i still use JS to check it?

[15:26:49] <yamahaalex37> so how is it part of the DOM
[15:30:25] <ag4ve> yamahaalex37: 'dev tools' = firebug?.... shouldn't really matter though. if you change a property of a dom element, the dom element still exists.
[15:31:10] <yamahaalex37> ag4ve, chrome dev tools. and i was wrong, it does appear

[15:34:00] <ElGoorf> ?google ajax internet explorer
[15:34:01] <bot-t> ElGoorf, Fixing Internet Explorer & AJAX - http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2008/06/26/3397.aspx
[15:35:22] <ElGoorf> are there any plans to put the fix into jquery instead of the developer having to work around the problem?
[15:38:07] <Eviltwin> No jQuery's going to continue to do what you tell it to
[15:38:32] <aaronmcadam> what's the issue?
[15:39:55] <Eviltwin> I'm actually not entirely clear
[15:40:02] <Eviltwin> But it looks like more IE bullshit
[15:41:05] <ElGoorf> eviltwin, basically internet explorer doesnt like $.ajax
[15:41:17] <ElGoorf> you have to use XdomaionRequests instead
[15:41:18] <Eviltwin> Uh, I've used $.ajax in IE many, many times
[15:41:20] <ElGoorf> domain*
[15:41:23] <Eviltwin> It likes it fine
[15:41:28] <ElGoorf> o rly
[15:41:38] <Eviltwin> I have whole websites that pivot around $.ajax working in IE
[15:41:39] <ElGoorf> looks like a common problem to me
[15:42:01] <Eviltwin> The problem can't be that general
[15:42:48] <Eviltwin> And based on my skimming of what's here
[15:42:52] <ElGoorf> wait
[15:43:01] <Eviltwin> I'm almost certain it would be all solved using the cache parameter specified here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:43:03] <ElGoorf> are you doing ajax requests to your own server, or cross server?
[15:43:08] <ElGoorf> its cross server thats the problem
[15:43:36] <Eviltwin> You're talking XSS?
[15:44:01] <ElGoorf> yeah
[15:44:08] <Eviltwin> Through what mechanism?
[15:44:17] <ElGoorf> $.ajax
[15:44:20] <Eviltwin> ...
[15:44:23] <ElGoorf> ...?
[15:44:34] <Eviltwin> Okay, I guess I'm going to have to read this myself

[15:53:03] <LukeNukem> hello, ive added a input file using jquery on class click
[15:53:25] <LukeNukem> but i cant use it from php like $_FILES['pic']['name']
[15:53:32] <oaken> Hello, can anyone please check small sample here - http://jsfiddle.net/6MZm6/ Why doesn't $('#cont').after('<h1></h1>', {text: 'Hello'}) work?
[15:54:31] <Eviltwin> Because that syntax isn't supported
[15:54:44] <Eviltwin> Just use the one below it
[15:55:21] <oaken> Both 3 of them are so similiar.. any reason for this?
[15:55:54] <Eviltwin> Um...because the goal of jQuery isn't to make every function support every kind of syntax you could possibly imagine?
[15:56:02] <nFFF> :P
[15:56:27] <Eviltwin> If 3 bytes is causing you a problem, you need to reevaluate your code
[15:57:21] <oaken> :) Of course it's not about 3 bytes but more the need to make additional wrap if it's not really needed
[15:57:37] <adfasdfj2> Hey guys, any idea why my links on the left arent' working properly in Chrome? Works fine in FF and other browsers, but when you view it in Chrome, it lags horribly or something: http://pressedweb.com/portfolio

[15:59:36] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, hi there mate
[16:07:07] <sroy2> Hi, if I have a fairly large (but static) json file that I'm using to populate the content of my site - is it better to try keep calling .getJSON() or try and store the entire file to local memory and call that over and over?
[16:34:09] <shwaiil> hi
[16:34:32] <shwaiil> Q: How to add a attr to a node el ? $(el).attr('new-attribute', 'value') ?!
[16:34:36] <shwaiil> Tks for looking
[16:58:35] <scar2> is there a way to FILTER a  table with jquery?
[17:01:09] <tos9> I'm apparently incorrectly trying to chain deferreds. http://bpaste.net/show/23916/  Top is coffeescript with included js if that's helpful. I'm trying to call getVimeoVideo(whatever).success(function (result) { console.log(result); }), say, and expecting that success to be chained after the callback that I provided (so that typeof result should be VimeoVideo). Why is that not so?
[17:33:37] <BadQuanta> So, I think calling event.preventDefault is breaking rails' UJS :disable-with functionality.  I want to maintain functionality of links when JS is not present, but I also like (and am fairly heavily invested in) the disable_with to prevent extra-clicks.
[17:34:15] <BadQuanta> The problem isn't that it doesn't disable.  It is that it won't reenable with jQuery.rails.enableElement()
[17:34:41] <BadQuanta> When I trace through the code, I see it aborts because the DOM does not have a data attribute it is looking for.
[17:35:07] <BadQuanta> However I don't understand why since it apparently does work when it comes to disabling the link.
[17:37:41] <pom> Is there a function similar to serialize() for forms but returns an object?
[17:47:33] <dismist> is it possible to use jquery to ajax a very long loading script.... a php script that outputs a number every 2 seconds?
[17:49:00] <__Pepper> dismist: ajax has a timeout like any http connection, so I am not sure what you mean by very long loading.
[17:49:32] <__Pepper> if your php script is spitting out numbers every 2 seconds, you can consider polling as well
[17:50:01] <__Pepper> that maybe a better option since it will at least have a more responsive effect to what ever logic you are trying to accomplish
[17:50:28] <crankharder> is there a way to trigger a click on a file input?  i.e., trigger opening of the native file selector

[19:48:47] <Whirl3d> is "table" a jquery object?
[19:48:59] <Whirl3d> if so, try table.find("tr");
[19:49:02] <crankharder> is there a way to trigger a click on a file input?  i.e., trigger opening of the native file selector
[19:49:50] <Whirl3d> crankharder, I don't understand your question--what do you mean by "a file input"
[19:49:50] <southofsomewhere> alright, was curious if there was an alternative to find.  that should work, thanks.
[19:50:48] <Whirl3d> southofsomewhere, the problem is that children() checks the immediate decendants, not all levels. So a <tbody> might be the only child of a <table> element, for example.
[19:50:54] <crankharder> input type='file'
[19:51:30] <Whirl3d> cranharder, did you try $("input:file").trigger("click");
[19:52:15] <crankharder> yea, nothin happens

[19:53:04] <Whirl3d> crankharder, I'm not sure what you mean by "opening the native file selector"?
[19:53:55] <crankharder> like when you click in a input name='file' element
[19:54:26] <crankharder> $("input:file").trigger("click") <-- just doesn't work in chrome
[19:54:29] <crankharder> works in ffx/safari
[19:55:59] <LukeNukem> hi, can someone please take a look http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9355935/jqueryform-not-outputting-javascript
[19:56:03] <Whirl3d> hmm sounds like a bug in Chrome, then. I don't know why it doesn't work...
[20:00:02] <skwirl> can someone tell me what is wrong with this php line
[20:00:11] <skwirl> echo "<area shape="poly" coords="421,31,448,58,421,93,391,62," href=" . $row['website_url'] . " id=" .$row['company'] . " alt="booth529" />";
[20:00:21] <skwirl> I keep getting..... this error message
[20:00:34] <southofsomewhere> you have a quote in your echo statement
[20:00:53] <skwirl> Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting ',' or ';' in /home/slsdesig/public_html/txhima/floor.php on line 120
[20:01:25] <Whirl3d> that sounds like a #php question, sorry
[20:01:25] <southofsomewhere> put an \ before each quote within the string
[20:01:33] <skwirl> okay
[20:01:48] <southofsomewhere> or use ', or dont use quotes at all
[20:02:04] <southofsomewhere> echo "<area shape="poly" ...
[20:03:31] <skwirl> I am trying to generate a n area tag with the id and href coming from a database
[20:03:59] <skwirl> php is invite only :(
[20:04:10] <Whirl3d> you just have to register your nick
[20:04:31] <southofsomewhere> yeah, I just said your issue is with double quotes :p
[20:05:13] <southofsomewhere> echo "<area shape=\"poly\" coords=\"421,31,448,58,421,93,391,62,\" href=" . $row['website_url'] . " id=" .$row['company'] . " alt=\"booth529\" />"
[20:07:11] <skudzz> thanks south
[20:13:53] <LukeNukem> Whirl3d, hey dude.
[20:16:31] <pom> I am trying to use .delegate(), but I can't get anything to work except for when my primary selector is (document).
[20:16:36] <pom> That can't be right?
[20:17:34] <LukeNukem> hello, im getting $ is undefined
[20:17:36] <LukeNukem> how can i fix this
[20:17:53] <pom> Make sure jquery lib is loaded before you call it.
[20:21:04] <LukeNukem> pom, jquery lib is loaded, i know cos all my other jquery stuff works T_T
[20:21:44] <pom> But is it loaded at the time when you call $?
[20:22:36] <LukeNukem> ok i put jquery.js in my config.php which means its loaded before <html> tag
[20:23:05] <LukeNukem> so im using jquery toast plugin and on first try it all worked fine but now i have this error [09:51:48.412] $().toastmessage is not a function @ http://localhost/process.php:27
[20:23:19] <LukeNukem> This is weird, it works at first and then does not work
[20:26:37] <LukeNukem> pom, you there
[20:27:34] <pom> Yes.
[20:45:01] <skudzz> can someone tell me what is wrong with this code:
[20:45:02] <skudzz> http://pastebin.com/QNgkA7D3
[20:45:19] <skudzz> the error is on line 9
[20:45:39] <skudzz> I am trying to display both the id and alt in my qtip balloon
[20:45:51] <skudzz> I am very new to this, so apologies in advance
[20:47:13] <bob489> hi, i'm using .post and ajax because i'm getting an error
[20:47:32] <bob489> .ajax error handler doesn't give me any details
[20:48:04] <bob489> any suggestions? i'm posting and expecting to get some json data back
[20:48:56] <bob489> no takers?
[20:49:20] <bob489> any special header fields required besides coneten-type?
[20:50:28] <pom> bob489: Focus on getter the errors to show.
[20:50:41] <pom> After that it will probably be easy.
[20:50:57] <pom> Are you using a debug tool?
[20:52:11] <bob489> i have firebug, but it doesn't show me anything
[20:52:29] <bob489> well it shows that there is a response header, but the body is blank
[20:57:26] <Onkeltem> HI all
[20:59:28] <aqeel> hi room
[21:00:40] <Onkeltem> I've get a problem with .hover() and believe it has some common solution. I have 3 photos, and when I hover over them, a tiny slider (arrow) should move toward the current photo. The problem is that the slider itself triggers mouseleave() of a photo :) Is it possible to make an element a kind of 'transparent' to hover events?
[21:01:40] <Onkeltem> z-index (the first thought) doesn't help here, since the slider gets behind photos :)
[21:02:59] <Vorspire> ?stopPropagation @ Onkeltem
[21:02:59] <Whirl3d> Onkeitem, if you place an element above the image (zIndex) and add a .mouseleave handler that has e.preventDefault() or returns false, it might prevent the event from going to the image below
[21:02:59] <bot-t> Onkeltem, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[21:03:15] <Whirl3d> or what he said, lol
[21:13:00] <ag4ve> how do i quote a string i'm sending to a function?
[21:13:07] <ag4ve> "<span onclick='return addMemDat(\'" + member_id + "\',\'" + member_name + "\');' name='li-span'>" + member_name + "</span>" ); isn't working
[21:13:24] <ag4ve> or, it's returning interesting results
[21:13:26] <Onkeltem> Vorspire, Whirl3d: thanks. I'm trying it right now, but w/o success though... The problem, is that the element (the slider) gets IN event *after* the photos gets OUT events.
[21:14:59] <Whirl3d> ag4ve, you should probably consider avoiding assigning event handlers like that.
[21:15:20] <aqeel> 3 photos are side by side or laying on top of each other
[21:15:40] <Onkeltem> aqeel: side by side.
[21:15:56] <Whirl3d> Onkeitem, this is why we have jsfiddle. Check it out and setup a use case and it will be easier to help
[21:16:08] <Onkeltem> I think of making some cursor coordinates checks, to see if it really leaves the photos area
[21:16:11] <aqeel> then u can simply assign onmouseover to piccture and slide to the slide
[21:16:18] <Onkeltem> Whirl3d: yes, sorry.
[21:17:13] <aqeel> like picture mouseover.....and get the slide id/class add .slide to it
[21:17:36] <aqeel> keeping the zindex of slide 1
[21:17:37] <JonathanCutrell> hey slick js folks...
[21:17:50] <JonathanCutrell> got a question about the most elegant way to do a certain jon.
[21:17:51] <JonathanCutrell> job*
[21:18:53] <JonathanCutrell> I've got an array of numbers, and I want to check on scroll event if the scroll left is within the range.
[21:19:01] <JonathanCutrell> I don't want 6 if else statements...
[21:19:06] <JonathanCutrell> is there a way to do this via a loop?
[21:19:17] <aqeel> .each()
[21:20:06] <Vorspire> $.each( myArrayOrObject, function(key, val){ } );
[21:23:15] <Whirl3d> $.each may be overkill, you might just want to do a for loop...
[21:24:36] <Vorspire> $.each is a for-loop wrapper, just conventient for associative objects
[21:25:19] <Whirl3d> for (var indx in values) { var checkval=values[indx]; var lft=itm.prop("scrollLeft")-checkval; if lft>0....}
[21:25:35] <Whirl3d> sounds like "an array of numbers" isn't associative
[21:26:39] <Vorspire> why not? it could be, he didn't say.
[21:27:40] <Whirl3d> true, technically true, but usually if someone wants to talk about an associative object, they are gonna say, "associative object' or 'associative array'...
[21:28:02] <Whirl3d> either would work, I am sure
[21:28:22] <Vorspire> and btw, indx in values is wrong
[21:28:35] <Vorspire> well not entirely, but it wil cause problems
[21:29:04] <Vorspire> for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){ var entry = arr[i]; }
[21:30:56] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ZCqsE/
[21:32:02] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ZCqsE/1/
[21:32:15] <Whirl3d> with both an object (associative array) and a plain array.
[21:33:11] <Onkeltem> Whirl3d: created example http://jsfiddle.net/NaQYG/2/
[21:33:28] <ibodi> which is the better way : $(document).ready(function(){...}); VS $(funciton(){...});
[21:33:44] <Onkeltem> aqeel: plase see the link <<<
[21:35:55] <aqeel> ok so what is the question now
[21:38:29] <Onkeltem> aqeel: when hovering green slider, LI
[21:39:11] <Onkeltem> LI's evens triggered and break things
[21:39:39] <Soopaman> is it possible to prototype the function property of an object?
[21:42:03] <Onkeltem> aqeel: by design the slider should disappear when you not hovering LI's
[21:42:21] <aqeel> ok
[21:43:46] <aqeel> well it does disapper on mouseout
[21:44:48] <Onkeltem> yes, but it also disappears when mouse enters its box, since mouseout also triggered on UL/LIs
[21:47:46] <Onkeltem> and .mouseenter on it happens after .mouseleave on UL/LIs. Otherwise, I would be able to workout this case
[21:49:22] <ag4ve> any idea why neither the jquery ui autocomplete 'select' event handler or my own .live handler isn't working here? http://scsys.co.uk:8002/183020
[21:50:58] <Whirl3d> Onkeitem, look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/NaQYG/23/
[21:51:04] <Whirl3d> as an idea
[21:54:06] <aqeel> whireld u r one hack of a guy......
[21:54:11] <aqeel> nice one
[21:54:29] <aqeel> <Onkeltem>............see his sample
[21:54:42] <aqeel> well got to go......bye room
[21:54:50] <Onkeltem> Yes, yes, reading code now!
[21:55:08] <Whirl3d> bye aqeel,
[22:10:18] <Onkeltem> Whirl3d: great!
[22:10:33] <Whirl3d> wait, one second
[22:11:06] <Onkeltem> Whirl3d: I'm learning from you revey line of code! So neat
[22:12:22] <Onkeltem> Whirl3d: but why e.preventDefault()? What it does there?
[22:17:53] <Onkeltem> Whirl3d: I would place slider position calculating code in a func and probably would use positions array as in my example to reuse positions info
[22:20:58] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/NaQYG/44/
[22:21:02] <Whirl3d> working on that. LOL
[22:21:14] <Whirl3d> Not sure why the info isn't showing correctly.
[22:45:05] <LordThumper> Hi, can someone take a look at this please?
[22:45:07] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/6WnZT/
[22:45:16] <sroy2> What is the syntax to appendTo() every <p> tag in <div id="#main">? appendTo(#main…something...p?)
[22:45:55] <LordThumper> How do I prevent the changed event from being fired if i click cancel?
[22:46:02] <coldhead> .appendTo('#main p')
[22:46:11] <sroy2> thanks
[22:47:51] <LordThumper> Is there an event that I could listen to that would allow me to stop the 'change' event from being fired?
[22:47:58] <LordThumper> After the user clicks the radio button
[22:48:50] <LordThumper> Hope that makes sense...
[22:52:50] <defaultro> hey follks, where do I start with jquery?
[22:53:48] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ defaultro
[22:53:49] <bot-t> defaultro, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[22:54:00] <defaultro> thanks a lot!!!!! :)
[22:57:50] <Jarred> Is anyone here familiar with HighCharts?
[22:59:23] <JonathanCutrell> Whirl3d and Vorspire - sorry about that. The array wasn't "associative", but arrays are ordered in js, so you can count on item 0 being item 0 as long as the array isn't resorted somehow.
[22:59:34] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: only a little.
[22:59:41] <gkatsev> highcharts ftw
[22:59:56] <LordThumper> Only google charts
[23:00:03] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: One more time… what are you trying to do?
[23:01:00] <LordThumper> I would like to capture the event when the user checks the "foo" radio button
[23:01:30] <LordThumper> If the user presses cancel, I return false in the function therefore the "foo" radio button will not become checked
[23:01:48] <LordThumper> However even if I do so, the "foo" radio element still fires the "change" event
[23:02:50] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, I tried creating an html element using jquery and the notation that you use and didn't get it right. I thought you wrote: $("a",{href:'#test', class:'icon inner', text:'sometext'}).appendTo(elem);
[23:02:55] <Jarred> gkatsev: JonathanCutrell: I'm getting 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined' on line 85 of highcharts.js. I'm unsure why, here's the JS/CoffeeScript --> https://gist.github.com/ff3669011d686436ab65
[23:03:07] <Jarred> It's not a result of it being the date
[23:03:24] <JonathanCutrell> one sec Jarred
[23:03:44] <Jarred> I can also send you a link to it live if you want to see it yourself
[23:03:54] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: http://jsfiddle.net/jcutrell/VqevN/
[23:04:11] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: No, it actually uses element syntax
[23:04:21] <Eviltwin> $("<a>", {...})
[23:04:30] <Whirl3d> doh! no wonder, thanks.
[23:04:40] <Onkeltem> Whirl3d: I'm here now, was afking
[23:05:14] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: I would imagine that the data that you are getting back in your json isn't actually working for you.
[23:05:33] <JonathanCutrell> do you know where the error is being raised? which line?
[23:05:38] <JonathanCutrell> is it 7 or 30?
[23:05:40] <Whirl3d> Onkeitem, I was just giving you an idea of how to do it diferently. I wrote that up really quickly...it's up to you to fine-tune it.
[23:05:49] <Jarred> 7
[23:05:51] <Jarred> er
[23:05:55] <Whirl3d> or toss it out and do it another way, I'm no expert..
[23:06:06] <Jarred> 85 of highcharts.js
[23:06:08] <JonathanCutrell> yea, so data.rounds isn't defined for whatever reason.
[23:06:09] <Jarred> Which isn't the file
[23:06:20] <JonathanCutrell> I've got 1-35 in my gist...
[23:06:23] <Jarred> the file is called 'show_companies.js'
[23:06:26] <LordThumper> JonathanCutrell: Thanks, but I am getting the old behaviour on my browser.
[23:06:34] <LukeNukem> hello all
[23:06:34] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: what browser?
[23:06:35] <LordThumper> The 'change' event is still getting fired
[23:06:39] <LordThumper> Chrome
[23:06:45] <LukeNukem> i have a div called topbar, i want it to stick to the screen even when scrolled down
[23:06:48] <LukeNukem> how can i do this
[23:06:49] <Jarred> JonathanCutrell: Its not my code, its high charts' JS file
[23:06:56] <Jarred> JonathanCutrell: See here http://dev.jarredsumner.com/companies/191
[23:07:01] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: one sec
[23:07:09] <Jarred> (The error is only thrown in Chrome)
[23:07:30] <Jarred> but I think the effect is that there is no hover effect on a point in the graph
[23:07:58] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: The change event fires before confirm comes up.
[23:08:18] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: if you want to prevent all future change events, that's a possibility.
[23:08:19] <Onkeltem> Whirl3d: yes, I understand this! And your first version was more then enough to get the idea :) I appreciate your time spend on my prob, thank you very much!
[23:08:40] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: the code I sent you prevents Foo from staying checked/selected/"on".
[23:08:47] <Onkeltem> Whirl3d: now reading the second script
[23:08:53] <Whirl3d> np. I have found that .on solves a lot of problems.
[23:09:14] <LukeNukem> anybody know how i can fix a div so that it does not move when user scrolls down?
[23:09:21] <LordThumper> JonathanCutrell: I understand that. But why would the 'change' event fire "before" the confirmation screen?
[23:09:29] <Whirl3d> the second script was just encapsulating the repeated functions better, like "centerSlider" (like you suggested).
[23:09:38] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: Because the change event fires whenever you click the radio button.
[23:09:40] <LordThumper> Then I return false in my function, and the radio button reverts?
[23:09:49] <john-dev> LukeNukem, css position: fixed;
[23:09:50] <LordThumper> Oh I see
[23:10:06] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: the default behavior isn't to launch a confirm screen.
[23:10:18] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: Does that make sense?
[23:10:25] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: it's doing its job.
[23:10:25] <LordThumper> Yes I know.
[23:10:40] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: You're just asking it to also launch a confirm screen.
[23:10:55] <LordThumper> What events would a radio element fire?
[23:10:59] <LordThumper> click, change?
[23:11:18] <john-dev> both
[23:11:26] <LordThumper> Yes, as in any more?
[23:11:41] <john-dev> maybe :selected
[23:11:54] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: there's a few.
[23:11:56] <LordThumper> I was looking for an event that is fired when an element state is "finalized"
[23:12:01] <JonathanCutrell> google is good for these things...
[23:12:06] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred - looking
[23:12:13] <LordThumper> Yes I am on jQuery API
[23:12:16] <john-dev> what is finalized?
[23:12:31] <Jarred> JonathanCutrell: I just fixed it
[23:12:32] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: not just a jQuery thing - it's a browser/javascript thing.
[23:12:37] <LordThumper> That is the state remains even if I return false in  my event handler
[23:12:40] <Jarred> I forgot to instantiate Highcharts.Chart
[23:12:45] <JonathanCutrell> ah.
[23:12:48] <JonathanCutrell> there ya go. :)
[23:12:53] <Jarred> lol yeah
[23:13:05] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: rails?
[23:13:11] <LordThumper> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[23:13:14] <LordThumper> Was looking at that
[23:14:09] <LordThumper> Well I am probably thinking about .Net Forms events, not javascript events which are user interaction oriented...
[23:14:30] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: Explain what you're trying to do.
[23:14:31] <LordThumper> Oh well, thanks alot anyways, I find another way to solve my issue :)
[23:15:08] <LordThumper> I am trying to tell the user if he is sure if he wants to select the "first" radio button
[23:15:34] <JonathanCutrell> LordThumper: Well the code you have there will do that.
[23:15:48] <LordThumper> Then another event handler that shows or hides a div according to the radio button state
[23:15:57] <john-dev> so .on click
[23:15:57] <LordThumper> Was trying to make them independent of each other
[23:16:08] <LordThumper> So the second event handler was listening to the 'change' event
[23:16:20] <LordThumper> Which was being fired even before the user selects "yes" or n
[23:16:26] <LordThumper> "no" in the confirmation
[23:16:32] <JonathanCutrell> on click, launch a confirm. if they don't confirm, prevent the default behavior of the change event (which is to change the value of the button)
[23:16:47] <john-dev> LordThumper, use it to execute the yes or no dialog
[23:17:15] <JonathanCutrell> sorry - on change, like john-dev is saying.
[23:17:30] <JonathanCutrell> you can even fire a custom event.
[23:18:07] <JonathanCutrell> $(".button").trigger("confirmation", {key : value});
[23:18:21] <JonathanCutrell> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[23:18:51] <LordThumper> Ah that would be good
[23:18:52] <LordThumper> Thanks
[23:18:53] <JonathanCutrell> ah, that shoulda been an array on the second param.
[23:19:48] <Jarred> JonathanCutrell: One more question, why can I only select the first and last points? http://dev.jarredsumner.com/companies/191
[23:20:24] <JonathanCutrell> that's some weirdness...
[23:20:28] <john-dev> JonathanCutrell, are you sure this will work?
[23:20:42] <JonathanCutrell> john-dev: sure what will work?
[23:20:51] <john-dev> the .trigger('confirm' stuff
[23:20:52] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: I'm a little lost on that one. Haha...
[23:21:08] <john-dev> he need's another binding first
[23:21:14] <JonathanCutrell> john-dev: You can definitely trigger custom events, and listen for them on that element.
[23:21:26] <john-dev> sure, but he need to create them first
[23:21:31] <Jarred> Alright
[23:21:32] <JonathanCutrell> create what?
[23:21:35] <Jarred> well thanks for trying
[23:21:47] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: I'm guessing it's one of two things
[23:21:54] <john-dev> a handler :-/
[23:21:59] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: either there's some weird configuration that's not set up
[23:22:21] <JonathanCutrell> john-dev: Don't have to have a handler for every triggered event.
[23:22:30] <JonathanCutrell> Handlers have to have events, but events don't have to have a handler.
[23:22:35] <JonathanCutrell> Of course he'd want to set it up
[23:22:46] <JonathanCutrell> but he doesn't have to have it set up before he sets it to trigger.
[23:23:05] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: or there's some css weirdness that's causing your hovers to be wonky.
[23:23:21] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: I'm getting flipped point hovering.
[23:23:37] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: when I get close to one point, it flips to the other point
[23:24:02] <Jarred> hmm
[23:24:50] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: which script is the high charts one?
[23:25:06] <Jarred> highcharts.js
[23:25:20] <Jarred> The one with the code to use highcahrts is show_companies.js
[23:25:50] <Jarred> It's Highcharts 2.0
[23:25:52] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: I bet it's something to do with the "series" array.
[23:25:53] <Jarred> I'll try the prior version
[23:25:58] <Jarred> Probably
[23:26:00] <Jarred> but what?
[23:26:05] <Jarred> I removed pointStart and pointInterval before
[23:26:09] <Jarred> and it still did it
[23:26:15] <JonathanCutrell> pointStart and pointInterval are wrong I would imagine.
[23:26:33] <JonathanCutrell> May not need to remove them… may need to fix them. :)
[23:26:35] <Jarred> oh
[23:26:36] <Jarred> you're right
[23:26:39] <Jarred> It is those
[23:26:44] <Jarred> Maybe I forgot to save last time
[23:26:47] <JonathanCutrell> haha
[23:26:55] <JonathanCutrell> there ya go.
[23:27:05] <Jarred> I thought Date.parse turns dates into seconds though?
[23:27:36] <john-dev> ok JonathanCutrell i missed that part where he had to .bind('confirm' his custom handler..
[23:27:45] <JonathanCutrell> that's what this says: Jarred - http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parse.asp
[23:28:10] <Jarred> Descending is lowest to highest or highest to lowest?
[23:28:22] <john-dev> ok, i missed that.. everything cleared
[23:28:25] <JonathanCutrell> john-dev: there's a thousand ways to do what he wants to do - just need to figure out which one works for that. Haha
[23:28:35] <JonathanCutrell> Jarred: good question.
[23:28:37] <JonathanCutrell> try them both.
[23:28:38] <JonathanCutrell> haha
[23:28:44] <john-dev> k, thx.. was confusing
[23:28:44] <JonathanCutrell> I'm vaguely familiar with hc.
[23:28:54] <Jarred> Its highest to lowest
[23:29:00] <Jarred> I switched it to ascending and it worked
[23:29:30] <JonathanCutrell> john-dev: I just wanted to show him that triggering custom events could be the solution to the problem, if the important part isn't the event and the associated data, but just a user interaction he wanted to capture. Does that make sense?
[23:30:22] <john-dev> sure, but in his case, i dont think so because trigereing a custom event needs a normal event in his case, like on click
[23:30:54] <john-dev> well whatever..
[23:31:02] <john-dev> i understood what you meant..
[23:50:40] <tocka> Hey guys
[23:51:01] <tocka> How can I echo text into #div?
[23:51:01] <Whirl3d> Hey Tocka
[23:51:04] <tocka> :)
[23:51:07] <tocka> hey;)
[23:51:25] <Whirl3d> $(div).text("sometext");
[23:51:28] <tocka> thanks :)
