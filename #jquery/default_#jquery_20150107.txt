[01:30:54] <Erwat> what's a shim?
[01:32:19] <Cork> Erwat: a drop in snippet of code that fills in for a feature missing in the environment
[01:32:59] <Cork> normally with a requirement for it to detect if the feature exists
[01:33:54] <bacobart> sometimes also called a polyfill
[01:33:58] <bacobart> though they're not exactly the same;P
[01:35:07] <Erwat> Cork: thank you
[01:43:25] <Philip> hello guyz
[01:43:47] <Philip> i got problem on click events
[01:43:53] <Omar-> hi Philip
[01:43:54] <Philip> i done some thing like this
[01:44:03] <Philip>  $("#cart").on("click", "li","ol",function( ){
[01:44:05] <Philip> 		
[01:44:06] <Philip> 	            var r = $(this).prop("id");
[01:44:08] <Philip> 	            console.log(r);
[01:44:09] <Philip> 	    });
[01:44:14] <Uhkis> ARGH
[01:44:18] <Uhkis> ?paste @ Philip
[01:44:18] <b-ot> Philip: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:44:23] <Philip> and on click time i got two id
[01:44:53] <Philip> sorry man but it's a long functionality  can't paste in fiddle
[01:45:17] <Omar-> "li","ol", this is wrong
[01:45:22] <Omar-> "li, ol" is correct
[01:45:40] <Philip> i have i multiple ol in li so i write this
[01:46:16] <Philip> but while clicking i return two id where i ckick or previous one
[01:46:29] <Philip> ckick click
[01:47:52] <Omar-> Philip is "li" wrapped in "ol">
[01:47:53] <Omar-> ?
[01:48:10] <Philip> yes li is wrapped in ol
[01:48:31] <Cork> "ol > li" then
[01:48:40] <Omar-> then why are you attaching click to "ol" too?
[01:49:10] <Omar->  $("#cart").on("click", "ol li", or as @Cork said
[01:49:26] <krambiorix> hi, i'm creating a jquery script  but i constantly get the error: $(...).submitForm is not a function  ... http://jsfiddle.net/sqnyq0c6/
[01:50:11] <Omar-> kraft .submit();
[01:50:21] <Omar-> sorry  krambiorix ^^
[01:50:34] <Omar-> nevermind
[01:51:39] <Cork> krambiorix: you either don't have the submitForm plugin included
[01:51:50] <a45874105> Hello. I am using jquery mobile and trying to add a ui-icon to a textbox. However if I add the classes "ui-icon-check ui-btn-icon-right" to the textbox no icon is shown. Is it possible to do this?
[01:51:51] <Cork> or you load it async and your code sometimes run before it is loaded
[01:52:32] <Omar-> a45874105 yes it's possible, but you have to add them to parent div (wrapper) .ui-input-text
[01:52:32] <Uhkis> wow, Cork is back :-)
[01:52:39] <Cork> uh, ya?
[01:52:58] <Cork> christmas, ever heard of it?
[01:53:30] <Uhkis> yeah, it's that stupid time of the year when shops are closed :D
[01:53:39] <Cork> heh
[01:53:53] <Cork> not really around here
[01:54:14] <a45874105> I tried doing that, which works but I have the input wrapped in a .ui-field-contain div and when I shrink the screen the icon jumps out of the text box.
[01:55:01] <krambiorix> Cork, the submitform plugin is in the same file
[01:55:42] <gtristan> hi, is it possible to remove a css attribute with $().css() ?
[01:55:44] <Cork> Omar-: and defined after?
[01:55:54] <gtristan> a zero length string perhaps as the value ?
[01:56:01] <Cork> yes
[01:56:15] * Kartagis imagines somebody new coming in who knows nothing about IRC and trying to type a45874105's nick
[01:56:17] <gtristan> Cork, that is for me ? thankyou
[01:56:25] <Cork> granden: though it isn't attributes
[01:56:38] <Omar-> a45874105 http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/s1w6aaf9/
[01:56:39] <Cork> but yes, it will remove css properties from the style attribute
[01:56:56] <gtristan> Cork, yeah ok... sorry for the misnomer :)
[01:57:18] <Omar-> Cork sorry, didn't get what you mean
[01:57:27] <gtristan>  $().css ('color', '') <-- removes the color property from the style attribute for the selected elements
[01:57:32] <gtristan> got it :)
[01:57:40] <Cork> yup
[01:57:56] <Cork> Omar-: .ready only have a mean if run before the body element (in head)
[01:58:03] <Cork> Omar-: anywhere else it is a no-op
[01:58:23] <Omar-> a45874105 better one http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/s1w6aaf9/1/
[01:58:26] <Cork> meaning it would be declared after the click handler
[01:58:52] <Cork> and as it is a statement and not a declaration ($.fn.name = vs function <name>)
[01:58:57] <Cork> it means it won't be uplifted
[01:59:33] <Cork> and technically it could fire before the function exists
[01:59:33] <Omar-> Cork yea, the function should be defined before adding click listener
[02:00:00] <Cork> the only other possible reason is that you have different frameworks holding $.fn
[02:00:07] <Cork> and they conflict
[02:00:25] <Cork> either by removing the function or replaceing $ or $.fn
[02:00:52] <a45874105> Omar- Thank you
[02:01:03] <Omar-> a45874105 np :)
[02:01:03] <Cork> Omar-: for a concrete example you could have two versions of jquery loaded
[02:01:20] <Cork> that would likely cause this
[02:01:59] <Omar-> Cork btw, it's krambiorix not mine :) I was trying to help
[02:02:16] <Cork> f**...
[02:02:29] <Omar-> lol
[02:03:00] <Philip> Hey Omar- i ready my fiddle
[02:03:02] <krambiorix> ??
[02:03:03] <Philip> http://jsfiddle.net/ks91L7Lf/
[02:03:13] <Omar-> Cork well, regardless, the info is helpful. I learn from it
[02:03:21] <Cork> krambiorix: so... every thing i said to Omar- for a while here was meant for you -_-'
[02:03:54] <krambiorix> Cork, i changed it while you were chatting with Omar- :D    http://jsfiddle.net/sqnyq0c6/1/
[02:04:41] <Cork> krambiorix: uh... no
[02:04:46] <krambiorix> Cork, ?
[02:04:50] <Cork> that is a hack to get around a problem
[02:04:53] <Cork> fix the problem instead
[02:05:04] <krambiorix> Cork, i think this is cleaner code, no?
[02:05:08] <Erwat> is there like an easy occupation that pays decent, doesn't require hard work or much skill (but can be dangerous)?
[02:05:26] <cambazz> hello, in a jquery form, i would like to validate prices, such as 10 is ok 10.01 is ok 10.99 is ok but not 10.995
[02:05:27] <Omar-> Philip     e.stopImmediatePropagation(); because the event is bubbling to parent wrappers     e.stopImmediatePropagation();
[02:05:28] <Erwat> the dangerous part would probably be why it would pay decent
[02:05:31] <krambiorix> Erwat, politician
[02:05:38] <Omar-> or e.stopPropagation();
[02:05:44] <Erwat> krambiorix: requires hard work and skill sadly
[02:05:57] <krambiorix> Erwat, lol
[02:06:00] <Cork> krambiorix: not if what you want to make a reusable plugin
[02:06:01] <cambazz> i previously defined a custom validator function with var ret = (pr * 100) == Math.floor(pr*100);
[02:06:02] <Philip> where i write e.stopPropagation()
[02:06:06] <Philip> OMar_
[02:06:09] <krambiorix> Erwat, are you living in EU?
[02:06:12] <Erwat> i'm just thinking of ideas what i could do instead of programming
[02:06:20] <krambiorix> Cork, should NOT be reusable
[02:06:25] <Erwat> and i'm completely drawing a blank
[02:06:28] <cambazz> but this screws up, like 19.99 is false but 29.99 is true, and it is because of floating point math
[02:06:33] <Cork> krambiorix: then why move it out of ready?
[02:06:36] <Omar-> Philip check the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/ks91L7Lf/1/
[02:06:49] <Cork> that just over complicates the code for no reason
[02:06:57] <krambiorix> Cork, yes, true
[02:07:14] <krambiorix> Cork, but in init() , how can i call submitForm() ?
[02:07:26] <Erwat> cambazz: could you cast it to string and check how many digits there are after the "."?
[02:07:51] <cambazz> Erwat: yes that sounds like a plan
[02:08:00] <krambiorix> Erwat, write a cool application and sell it as SaaS ?
[02:08:14] <Erwat> again, requires skill and hard work
[02:08:33] <Omar-> Philip $("#cart") not $("#cart ol")
[02:08:39] <Cork> krambiorix: testthingy.submitForm()
[02:08:54] <Cork> krambiorix: or store a reference to this from outside the click handler
[02:08:57] <Erwat> i was thinking something more like a suicide bomber: low barrier to entry, easy job, just high risk; however i'd like it to not be about hurting people and a higher than 0% chance of survival
[02:08:59] <Philip> ok Omar i test your code
[02:09:07] <krambiorix> Cork, hmm i thought i tested that...
[02:09:12] <krambiorix> Cork,  thanks a lot mate!
[02:09:37] <krambiorix> Erwat, suicide bomber is just being developer but faster :)
[02:09:50] <Philip> Omar thank you so much for help it's work
[02:09:56] <Erwat> it was just an example, i don't want to hurt others
[02:10:10] <Omar-> Philip you're welcome :)
[02:10:58] <krambiorix> Erwat, normally in a job, you don't hurt others
[02:11:07] <krambiorix> Erwat, or it's the mob
[02:16:36] <Erwat> i don't know what else i could do instead of programming
[02:55:01] <Erwat> i'm looking at a 17MB concatenated file
[02:55:15] <Erwat> it's not minified but for some reason it seems like 17MB of javascript is a bit too much
[03:00:43] <Cork> Erwat: i would say, ya
[03:01:45] <Erwat> ah
[03:01:49] <Erwat> i think i know why it could be
[03:02:10] <Erwat> maybe it concatenated all of the base64 stuff into it too and since i didn't filter it out per game it would take every single game as well
[03:04:06] <Cork> Erwat: i have a moster site that basically builds a desktop with jquery (window managing task bar and so on)
[03:04:26] <Cork> and uncompressed, unminified including jquery and jquery-ui it is 1.4mb
[03:04:51] <Erwat> well yeah 17MB of code is what? 8.5 million characters?
[03:05:53] <Cork> depends if it is unicode or ascii :)
[03:07:06] <Cork> but it would be 17.8 m ascii or 8.9m utf16
[03:07:21] <Cork> close to impossible to say what it would be in utf8 as it is variable
[03:08:52] <Erwat> it's interesting, i just played with my phone for like 10 minutes
[03:08:59] <Erwat> and it cheered me up and made me want to try again
[03:09:03] <Cork> Erwat: ~17mb is about where you end up when you compile binary code to js
[03:09:30] <Cork> emscripten output is commonly in that range
[03:09:54] <Erwat> hmm thisc oncat added ;#!/usr/bin/env node into code
[03:12:12] <Erwat> >Load timeout for modules: bundle.min
[03:12:13] <Erwat> lol
[03:13:17] <kk_drop> is it possible to go through not-enumerable properties of object?
[03:13:51] <Cork> kk_drop: not if the properties is explicitly said to not be enumerable no
[03:14:02] <kk_drop> becouse when I try to object.someproperty.each(function(){console.log(this);}); i still get object.property instead of object.property.property1, object.property.property2 etc
[03:14:03] <Cork> (defined with Object.defineProperty)
[03:14:14] <kk_drop> it is not. so is there any way to access it?
[03:14:29] <Cork> ?paste
[03:14:29] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:15:24] <Erwat> Cork: i figured out the problem
[03:15:53] <Erwat> the bundle is now 245MB
[03:16:14] <kk_drop> Cork, not possible, object is huge and it's from source code of drupal cms
[03:16:44] <Cork> kk_drop: well, as i don't know the context of the code you run
[03:16:52] <Cork> i will have to assume a LOT of things
[03:17:04] <kk_drop> http://storage8.static.itmages.com/i/15/0107/h_1420628035_3957188_ac3da0619d.png
[03:17:16] <Cork> so here goes, i will assume object.someproperty is not a jquery object
[03:17:38] <Cork> and if you then want to loop it you would have to do $.each(object.someproperty, function(key, value) { })
[03:17:44] <kk_drop> this is object of googlemaps objects
[03:18:07] <Cork> so yes
[03:18:34] <Cork> anyway that should give you a loop of all none inhereted properties
[03:19:11] <Cork> if you want to loop all properties you would have to use for(key in object.property) { object.property[key] }
[03:19:25] <Cork> but be aware that you risk looping things you didn't intend
[03:20:12] <Erwat> with node and grunt * is wildcard right? *.js means any file with the name ending in .js
[03:20:33] <Erwat> ** would be any folder, does blah/**/*.js include .js ending files in the folder blah itself?
[03:21:54] <Cork> no
[03:22:05] <Erwat> thank you
[03:23:13] <kk_drop> Cork, thanks, it helped
[03:28:45] <Erwat> Cork: it ended up being 286 kb!
[03:28:51] <Cork> heh
[03:28:57] <Cork> that's a lot better :)
[03:29:10] <Erwat> and that's not minified
[03:29:33] <Erwat> i still need to get libs separately currently but that's just a different concat, although that did end up making it a lot bigger
[03:32:01] <Cork> Erwat: this is prob the simplest way to do what you want: find -iname '*.js*' -print0 -exec cat {} \; | wc -c
[03:32:08] <Cork> opps
[03:32:17] <Cork> should be -iname '*.js'
[03:32:56] <Cork> remove the -c at the end if you wants bytes instead
[03:33:06] <Erwat> Cork: what is that?
[03:33:20] <Cork> a command line
[03:33:21] <Erwat> in a linux shell?
[03:33:33] <Cork> works in all unix like systems (should work in mac too)
[03:33:37] <Erwat> i see
[03:33:51] <Erwat> already got that sorted though, thanks
[03:33:56] <Erwat> i was wondering mainly about the usage of **
[03:33:58] <Cork> ... and i mix up my command lines >_<
[03:34:01] <Erwat> whether it included the folder itself
[03:34:10] <Cork> -c IS binary
[03:34:14] <Cork> -m is character
[03:34:29] <Cork> Erwat: ya **/* and the like is a mess
[03:34:39] <Cork> and what you will get out of it will depend on what shell you run
[03:34:49] <Cork> its quite unpredictable
[03:35:14] <Erwat> sadly i do not understand what you are saying in my context
[03:35:19] <Erwat> while i understand that yeah it's different in a shell
[03:35:28] <Cork> sh does one thing, zsh does one, bash another, ksh a third fish yet another
[03:35:29] <Erwat> this is what i use in a gruntfile
[03:35:34] <Cork> and then there is options >_<
[03:36:21] <Uhkis> sh is a symlink to bash in many linux distros
[03:36:30] <Cork> linux yes
[03:36:35] <Cork> unix like; no
[03:37:01] <Cork> mac uses zsh for example if i remember correctly
[03:37:07] <Cork> bsd uses sh, not bash
[03:37:19] <mooncup> shhh
[03:38:01] <Uhkis> and mooncup uses python ;-D
[03:38:08] <Cork> and then its the shopt -s globstar
[03:38:14] <Cork> to makes it even more unreliable
[03:38:52] <mooncup> lol Uhkis
[03:38:58] <mooncup> we
[03:39:41] <Uhkis> mooncup: you know this, right? http://bash.org/?400459
[03:40:49] <Cork> wow... just... wow
[03:40:50] <Cork> https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=kC9VcpIG1Ms#t=875
[03:41:27] <Cork> robbing the local supermarket is better then developing for a propriatary software company?
[03:42:42] <Uhkis> lol
[03:44:03] <Uhkis> proprietary software = malware (c) stallman
[03:44:09] <Cork> true
[03:47:06] <Cork> Uhkis: not to forget "I am the father of open source, it was conceived via artificial insemination using stolen sperm."
[03:47:06] <Erwat> i think stallman has a point
[03:47:16] <Erwat> but i think either he's very intelligent and clever
[03:47:19] <Erwat> or incredibly shortsighted
[03:47:40] <Cork> no i think he is the oposite, he is long sited
[03:47:46] <Erwat> he wants a completely different society, but pushes for it purely through software
[03:47:47] <Uhkis> i think stallman has finally lost it completely
[03:47:51] <Cork> and that makes it too extream in the short term
[03:48:18] <Cork> i agree with much of what he says in the core arguments
[03:48:22] <Cork> but he drives it WAY to far
[03:48:53] <Erwat> also he's wrong in the sense that developing free software is always a contribution
[03:49:18] <Cork> depends if others can find it
[03:49:30] <Erwat> well it's not that
[03:49:43] <Erwat> it's just that if you make 10 000 applications to view images
[03:49:45] <Cork> if it is shared and really bad code ppl can learn quite a bit from it
[03:49:48] <mooncup> yeah Uhkis
[03:49:57] <Erwat> that aren't very good, but there is one made by someone else that is pretty decent
[03:49:59] <mooncup> 12:47 < Uhkis> i think stallman has finally lost it completely
[03:50:01] <mooncup> also
[03:50:04] <Erwat> then you're drowning out the good one
[03:50:04] <mooncup> he lost it ages ago
[03:50:15] <Uhkis> mooncup: _completely_ :)
[03:50:18] <Erwat> too much information at once is also bad
[03:50:26] <Cork> mooncup: ya, he has stared into the moon a bit too much ;)
[03:52:01] <Uhkis> haha, "non free software" drawn to this gnu/linux circle like cancer :D
[03:52:17] <Cork> :)
[03:52:33] <Erwat> the problem with free software is that
[03:52:48] <Erwat> money
[03:53:26] <Erwat> while it's possible to make money with free software and all that, it probably makes it more difficult
[03:53:39] <Erwat> and probably excludes certain things that could otherwise be done
[03:53:50] <Cork> true and false
[03:54:05] <Cork> but the same is true for app stores too
[03:54:30] <Erwat> yeah but if you limit yourself to purely free software you're limiting your choices
[03:54:34] <Cork> its a different model so you would have to adapt how you do business to the model
[03:54:44] <Erwat> you say that but
[03:55:03] <Erwat> even a 5% loss of revenue would probably be a big enough deal that it's not really worth it
[03:55:24] <Erwat> i mean the video game industry is like $80 billion a year
[03:55:30] <Erwat> imagine if that lost 5% revenue
[03:55:48] <Cork> well look at the free for play games
[03:55:57] <Erwat> i do
[03:56:05] <Erwat> but they aren't free software
[03:56:06] <Cork> they do earn quite a bit of money
[03:56:07] <Erwat> they are just free to access
[03:56:15] <Cork> sure, but the same model would still work
[03:56:29] <Erwat> in fact i think those free to play games would actually not work if they were free software
[03:56:34] <Cork> as the only difference is that modders would have an easier situation
[03:56:49] <Erwat> or somebody could take the code and put up their alternative
[03:57:04] <Erwat> and you would have no legal recourse (although even that's questionable nowadays)
[03:57:41] <Cork> you can get a working business that isn't based of forcing the user
[03:58:04] <abailarri> Hello. I have this script and I want to add in the content var the total of the each. Now only stores in the var the last result of the each. What I'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/aj0v4kvn/1/
[03:58:08] <Cork> but yes, it meas you have to revert the power structure, and that is scary
[03:58:12] <Erwat> yeah but "working business" doesn't mean you'd have the same opportunities and that's what i'm talking about
[03:58:19] <Cork> but it is possible, and it doesn't have be to at a monetary loss
[03:58:42] <Cork> what you charge for has to be reasonable and something the user wants
[03:58:47] <Cork> its as simple as that
[03:58:57] <Erwat> but it will be at a monetary loss
[03:59:04] <Cork> doesn't have to be
[03:59:06] <Erwat> because digital goods do not carry the value they are charged
[03:59:16] <Cork> exactly :)
[03:59:22] <Erwat> because digital goods either do well or do very poorly most of the time
[03:59:25] <Cork> many apps/games is way over charged
[03:59:29] <Cork> same for movies
[03:59:31] <Erwat> this, again, means that those with more money just win
[04:00:13] <Erwat> think of this for a moment: flappy bird comes out, now the guys hwo made candy crush go "yeah that's cool", take the soruce, add their own animations and release it
[04:00:17] <Cork> abailarri: +=
[04:00:17] <Erwat> right next to that with their power
[04:00:31] <Erwat> they will essentially crush any chance of competition because they have so much more visibility and money
[04:00:50] <Erwat> of course this could've happened anyway since that game took literally 1 hour to make
[04:01:10] <Erwat> but for a more complicated game this option is completely on the table
[04:01:38] <Cork> Erwat: what you just described basically happens today
[04:01:55] <Erwat> it does but then they at least have to remake the game themselves
[04:01:59] <Erwat> or break laws to acquire the source
[04:02:00] <Cork> and it doesn't really depend on the source being accessable
[04:03:10] <Erwat> huh i wonder
[04:03:17] <Erwat> am i even allowed to concat these libs together?
[04:03:39] <Cork> as long as you don't remove there license header; sure
[04:04:09] <Cork> minifiers normally have special exceptions for license comments
[04:05:33] <Cork> Erwat: there are plenty of minifires/concaters that does this automatically as the scripts detect updated files (or as you publish the site)
[04:05:49] <Cork> its normally a better option to use one of them then manually do it
[04:07:04] <Erwat> yeah, except i don't trust them
[04:07:10] <Erwat> the requirejs one didn't work at all
[04:07:18] <Erwat> even though the entire project is require compatible
[04:07:27] <Erwat> it just adds the require calls in dynamically
[04:07:31] <Cork> well requirejs does the handling client side
[04:07:38] <Cork> not concating it server side
[04:07:58] <Erwat> which is funny because i had the flag set for that not to happen
[04:08:00] <Erwat> still did it anyway
[04:08:08] <Erwat> well i want to be able to push out a build
[04:08:15] <Erwat> so it wouldn't load 230 different files
[04:08:20] <Cork> sure, and those where the systems i talked about
[04:08:30] <Cork> requirejs isn't one of the ones i ment
[04:08:35] <Erwat> yes and require has r.js which is supposed to do that except it didn't at all
[04:08:45] <Cork> as its core philosophy is the complete opposite
[04:09:37] <Cork> load as little as possible often instead of make the first time slow
[04:09:51] <Cork> instead of loading the first batch so you don't have to later
[04:10:06] <Erwat> yep i realized as much
[04:10:29] <Erwat> thanks for pointing it out to me again, i almost had forgotten that i should be thinking of a new field to go into
[04:10:30] <Cork> requirejs has a usecase
[04:10:56] <Cork> but you would have to basically get into emscripten size before it is useful
[04:11:16] <Cork> where loading everything you need at start would purge the cache
[04:11:21] <Cork> so you would constantly have to load things
[04:26:40] <Kartagis> is it a bad idea to include a jquery code in footer? my guess is it wouldn't run, am I correct?
[04:26:50] <Cork> no
[04:27:04] <Cork> .ready would stop working but that is about it
[04:27:32] <Cork> it isn't recommended to put jquery at the bottom, but it does mostly work
[04:29:48] <g33kyboi> snap.js
[04:30:19] <g33kyboi> how do i make the snap-drawer overlay?
[04:30:39] <Erwat> shots fired in france :<
[04:36:46] <R13ose> hi
[04:37:35] <[Non]> hi
[04:37:38] <[Non]> datepicker sometimes working
[04:37:40] <[Non]> sometimes not working
[04:37:41] <[Non]> why?
[04:38:44] <Omar-> jQM?
[04:39:30] <[Non]> okay however it because of caches
[04:41:04] <R13ose> I have problems with my website that I have mentioned yesterday a number of times and didn't get to a final answer.  What should I do?
[04:41:25] <[Non]> create js fiddle
[04:41:30] <[Non]> and let us look at the problem.
[04:41:47] <Cork> R13ose: repeat the question so that someone that have an idea can see it
[04:42:20] <Erwat> i'm not sure how i'm going to concat libs together so that those libs will actually be used too
[04:43:16] <Cork> Erwat: find -iname '*.js' -exec cat {} >> concat-result.js
[04:43:22] <Cork> opps
[04:43:25] <Cork> Erwat: find -iname '*.js' -exec cat {} >> concat-result.js \;
[04:43:37] <Erwat> 1. i'm using windows and 2.
[04:43:39] <Erwat> the issue isn't that
[04:43:54] <Cork> ok?
[04:43:59] <Erwat> the issue is that libs are given paths in the require config file
[04:44:14] <Erwat> but now i want to load them from some concatenated file (or even the same one)
[04:44:25] <R13ose> When I hover over the big images (background-image(s)), the popup thumbnails come up and I want to take the alt of the current big image and put that above the thumbnails. Site: http://ecosanity.org/
[04:44:28] <Cork> just give the path to the concat
[04:45:20] <Erwat> yeah but then iw ould have to change where the libs should be looked for in the require.config file too!
[04:45:39] <Cork> R13ose: so you want to put the background image as an image above the black bar?
[04:45:55] <Cork> Erwat: uh, ya?
[04:45:59] <Erwat> anyways i need to think on this; in essence it's really easy but not my project an di do not like doing sweeping changes
[04:46:07] <Cork> that is kinda why you want to have an automated cache that does it
[04:46:12] <Erwat> i didn't want to even use javascript at all precisely because of this kind of shit
[04:46:29] <Cork> this has nothing to do with js
[04:46:35] <Erwat> sure it does
[04:46:37] <Cork> no
[04:46:51] <Erwat> in almost every other language i've used you do not have to manually do build or import or similar code
[04:46:52] <Cork> its about how the server builds the resources
[04:46:58] <Erwat> since those languages natively support it
[04:46:59] <Cork> and has ZERO to do with js
[04:47:34] <Cork> you made the choice to do it by hand
[04:47:42] <Cork> well... guess what; you have to do it by hand
[04:47:53] <R13ose> Cork: I want to take the alt that is a sentence and put that as the sentence above the thumbnails which you hover over the background image.
[04:47:57] <Erwat> except there really is no choice here
[04:48:14] <Erwat> the tools you talk about all have a huge bunch of asterisks that the project has to fit
[04:48:20] <Erwat> and you have to take it into account etc
[04:48:33] <Cork> Erwat: php, python, go, rails, ruby all have libs to do the concatination work for you
[04:48:50] <Cork> Erwat: haven't looked into node.js much but i'm sure they do to
[04:48:55] <DRSK> I've got an input for quantity and now I'd like to clone() inputs so they correspond to the quantity. What would be the easiest way of doing that?
[04:49:05] <Erwat> what does this have anything to do with it, Cork
[04:49:12] <Erwat> js has libs that do it too
[04:49:13] <Cork> if you use that, it means you use the separate files and the lib does the concating and caching for you
[04:49:19] <Cork> no
[04:49:22] <Erwat> but your project has to be set up in some special way for all of them
[04:49:25] <Cork> js is client side
[04:49:29] <Cork> it NEVER does it
[04:49:33] <Erwat> of course you do
[04:49:37] <Erwat> the developer should be able to run a tool
[04:49:42] <Erwat> but you can't
[04:49:46] <Cork> uh
[04:50:01] <Cork> Erwat: js doesn't even have the concept of files
[04:50:03] <Cork> so no it doesn't
[04:50:16] <Cork> it does have a concept of data streams
[04:50:20] <Cork> but that is the closest you get
[04:50:42] <Erwat> maybe being a janitor won't be so bad afterall
[04:50:44] <Erwat> hmm
[04:52:57] <Cork> DRSK: var clones=$(); for(var i = 0; i < max) { clones = clones.add(org.clone()); }
[04:53:09] <Cork> opps missed ;i++
[04:53:15] <Cork> DRSK: var clones=$(); for(var i = 0; i < max;i++) { clones = clones.add(org.clone()); }
[04:53:44] <Cork> DRSK: then just inject the clones where you want them
[04:53:49] <DRSK> Cork » aye, I did that just now but the "max" is actually looking how many there are so I'm getting an exponential increase in clones :P
[04:54:10] <Cork> DRSK: you would have to store the value before the for starts
[04:54:16] <Cork> else you will run the check each loop
[04:54:25] <DRSK> right gotcha thanks Cork
[04:54:27] <Cork> and that is both slow, and will give the wrong result
[04:54:42] <Cork> DRSK: also note that i use .add()
[04:54:52] <Cork> don't inject the new elements on each loop, that is VERY slow
[04:55:11] <Cork> collect them and do the append/html/what-ever after the loop
[04:55:13] <DRSK> So "clones" will contain my clones then I use clones to appendTo or whatnot?
[04:55:20] <DRSK> ah yeah good point thanks ;D
[04:55:21] <Cork> yes
[04:56:57] <quackgyver> Hey. I've tried googling about this but I can't really understand the provided solutions (e.g. from SE and whatnot). I have two different jQuery scripts that require two different version of jQuery, and the versions seem to be mutually exclusive.
[04:57:06] <quackgyver> So like one script will not work when one lib is called, and vice versa.
[04:57:19] <quackgyver> I read about something called noConflict, but I don't really get it.
[04:57:24] <quackgyver> Can someone explain?
[04:57:31] <Cork> quackgyver: you can load two versions of jquery at the same time
[04:57:47] <Cork> but is is, very VERY V-E-R-Y much not recommended
[04:58:03] <quackgyver> Cork: Yeah I know. I just started working at this place so I'm going to fix these hacky solutions later.
[04:58:08] <quackgyver> But right now I just gotta get it working.
[04:58:10] <Cork> the noConflict was meant for getting jquery to coexist with other frameworks
[04:58:27] <Cork> plugins won't work with noConflict
[04:58:50] <Cork> they always load the the jquery version loaded latest before them
[04:59:10] <Cork> and has no way to get loaded to the other without loading them again ( or modifying them)
[04:59:58] <quackgyver> Cork: Alright.
[05:00:14] <quackgyver> The thing is that
[05:00:28] <quackgyver> One script requires the newer version, and the other requires the older jq version.
[05:00:36] <quackgyver> Are you saying that I can't use noConflict to resolve this?
[05:05:09] <R13ose> Cork: thoughts?
[05:05:22] <Cork> R13ose: i asked a question didn't get a response
[05:05:37] <Cork> quackgyver: not really
[05:05:49] <R13ose> Cork: I answered that
[05:05:59] <Cork> quackgyver: you're better of looking for an updated version of the old version
[05:06:25] <Cork> or use an old version of the other libs that require a version that works with the old lib
[05:06:37] <Cork> quackgyver: btw, what is it the breaks the old plugin?
[05:06:55] <Cork> there is jquery-migrate it MIGHT be a solution
[05:06:57] <Uhkis> shouldn't be too hard to fix
[05:07:09] <Cork> depends on how old of a version it depends on
[05:07:28] <Cork> if it is 1.3 or something scary like that it can be really painful
[05:07:51] <Cork> (and the size of the plugin)
[05:09:03] <R13ose> Cork: do you see this?  Maybe you are too busy with helping others.
[05:09:23] <Cork> R13ose: if you answered it got pass me
[05:09:39] <R13ose> Cork: I want to take the alt that is a sentence and put that as the sentence above the thumbnails which you hover over the background image.
[05:09:49] <R13ose> Cork: can you show me a screenshot of the site as you see this?
[05:09:49] <Cork> uh, that was the original question
[05:09:54] <Cork> and yes i saw that
[05:10:01] <Cork> i asked a question
[05:10:12] <R13ose> Cork: what did you ask?
[05:10:26] <Cork> <Cork> R13ose: so you want to put the background image as an image above the black bar?
[05:10:39] <quackgyver> Cork: the version is 1.4.5
[05:11:02] <Cork> quackgyver: ok, and what version does the other ones depend on?
[05:11:04] <quackgyver> No wait, 1.4.3
[05:11:05] <R13ose> Cork: that answer was for that question
[05:11:14] <quackgyver> The other one depends on the latest one (it's fancybox)
[05:11:45] <Cork> man i english could remove the word latest
[05:12:01] <Cork> its so extremely none saying
[05:12:22] <Cork> quackgyver: anyway fancybox has existed for ages i know it worked back in 1.3
[05:12:33] <Cork> so you should be able to find an old version that works with 1.4.3
[05:12:41] <quackgyver> If I include the 1.4.3 version along with the 1.11.0 version, Fancybox will complain that "element.prop is not a function"
[05:12:42] <quackgyver> ah
[05:12:46] <quackgyver> good idea, ill try that :D
[05:12:52] <quackgyver> +1 cool point to you
[05:13:10] <krambiorix> i have multiple pages in my webapplication, but in jquery i want to keep the customerid ... How can i store it without the user can view it in the source?
[05:13:37] <Cork> krambiorix: you can't
[05:13:52] <Cork> even if you send it over ajax the user can still access it if they want
[05:14:19] <Cork> basically data you can't show to the user should never go over the wire
[05:14:43] <Cork> create a unique reference server side and use that instead
[05:14:53] <R13ose> :(
[05:15:21] <Cork> R13ose: if you want help, make it simple to help you
[05:15:26] <Cork> it is in you're best interest
[05:15:47] <Cork> just answer the questions short and clear and things should move along much faster
[05:15:52] <krambiorix> Cork, ow maybe in a session variable?
[05:16:02] <Cork> krambiorix: for example
[05:16:17] <R13ose> Cork: I did.  Maybe you are not following what I am saying.
[05:16:38] <Cork> R13ose: no, you answered a yes/no question with restating the original question
[05:16:46] <Cork> that is neither short or clear
[05:17:43] <R13ose> Cork: No
[05:18:24] <Kev-> I have an element that uses .load() to get some more stuff. How do I make sure .click() events also apply to the content that's loaded afterwards?
[05:18:40] <R13ose> Cork: I want to put the alt within a#slideimage above the thumbnails in that black bar.
[05:18:52] <Kev-> i.e. if I want to monitor the .load()-ed content for new .click() events
[05:18:53] <Cork> Kev-: you don't
[05:19:03] <Cork> Kev-: you use .delegate or the delegate syntax for .on
[05:19:11] <Kev-> ah ok
[05:19:15] <Cork> and delegate the event handler to a static parent
[05:19:24] <Cork> (that .load doesn't replace)
[05:27:49] <Kev-> Hmm I'm using >1.7 so it seems I can use .on() also
[05:28:45] <Kev-> I'll give it a shot
[05:28:46] <Kev-> Thanks Cork
[05:28:49] <Kev-> Very helpful :)
[05:31:20] <R13ose> Cork: ?
[06:03:42] <stangeland> Isnt there some jquery library where i can hand it a datastructure of filenames and dirnames, and then it renders it like windows explorer?
[06:11:22] <DRSK> stangeland » http://www.jqueryrain.com/demo/jquery-treeview/ ?
[06:11:47] <DRSK> 'tree' being the keyword ;p
[06:18:57] <bl4ckdu5t> will .click() work just as fine for tap events on touch devices?
[06:19:11] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: depends
[06:19:26] <Cork> the click event fires when the user taps the device
[06:19:29] <Cork> but it fires much later
[06:19:37] <Cork> so you can get a lagy feeling
[06:20:09] <bl4ckdu5t> so it will be better to use a another library like https://github.com/benmajor/jQuery-Touch-Events ?
[06:21:49] <Cork> well that or just bind the touchstart event
[06:22:08] <Cork> $().on('click touchstart', function() {})
[06:23:17] <Cork> that handler will fire twice though, so if your code can't handle that use the plugin
[06:23:26] <bl4ckdu5t> ok that's much better. I was reluctant to use that
[06:23:38] <rockfruit> today irc seems half made from Cork
[06:24:48] <bl4ckdu5t> It's just for the mobile version of my blog. I don't think I want to be too meticulous on minor htings like that. Besides I get lesser views from mobile
[06:25:25] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: start by using click, and check the difference
[06:25:31] <Cork> you might feel click is good enough for you
[06:25:43] <bl4ckdu5t> ok
[06:25:44] <Cork> (i usually don't bother to use touchstart my self)
[06:27:22] <Omar-> bl4ckdu5t click should work fine on mobiles
[06:28:08] <Cork> the only point where touchstart is really handy is when you want to support draggin or drawing
[06:28:18] <Cork> then it is basically a must if you want good support on mobile
[06:28:25] <Omar-> +1
[06:32:09] <prohobo> dudes
[06:32:14] <prohobo> how does clone() work?
[06:32:17] <prohobo> dudes
[06:32:26] <Cork> prohobo: cloneNode
[06:32:39] <prohobo> i have template HTML
[06:32:45] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Element.cloneNode
[06:32:50] <prohobo> that i need to duplicate, change the values and input some data
[06:32:55] <Cork> clone works on elements, not html
[06:32:59] <prohobo> when i call clone() it clones other shit too
[06:33:02] <prohobo> ah
[06:33:11] <prohobo> ty
[06:33:19] <Cork> uh...
[06:33:20] <Cork> fr???
[06:33:26] * Cork pokes google...
[06:33:29] <prohobo> fr?
[06:33:34] <Cork> the link
[06:33:36] <prohobo> oh
[06:33:42] <Cork> it used the french version -_-'
[06:33:58] <prohobo> replacing fr with en doesn't work :(
[06:34:26] <Cork> just ah, so it is the constant rewrite they like to do
[06:34:43] <Cork> there https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.cloneNode
[06:34:56] <Cork> sigh
[06:35:02] <prohobo> anyways, i can use cloneNode(htmlElement) instead of $(htmlElement).clone()
[06:35:07] <Cork> they might want to think about redirecting the old urls -_-'
[06:35:15] <Cork> no
[06:35:23] <Cork> you don't clone html
[06:35:26] <Cork> html is just a string
[06:35:39] <Cork> copy it as much as you like
[06:35:47] <prohobo> hmmm
[06:35:48] <Cork> no need to clone it
[06:35:53] <prohobo> ah yeah
[06:36:35] <Cork> prohobo: basically the reason clone exist is to you can add the same element in the page again
[06:36:52] <Cork> $('#source').appendTo('#target') will MOVE the element not copy it
[06:36:58] <Cork> that is why you need clone
[06:37:21] <Cork> every time you append html it will be parsed into new elements
[06:37:26] <Cork> and that is why you don't need clone
[06:38:53] <prohobo> yeah
[06:39:22] <prohobo> that's essentially what im trying to do
[06:39:30] <prohobo> i have template HTML with display: none
[06:39:49] <Cork> uh display none or not doesn't matter
[06:39:58] <Cork> is it inside the dom then it isn't a template
[06:40:12] <Cork> well it is, kinda
[06:40:15] <Cork> but it won't be html
[06:40:28] <Cork> it will be parsed as the page parses, so you will have to handle elements
[06:41:24] <stangeland> hello, when i execute this recursive code: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/9687900/ i get an error saying:  Uncaught HierarchyRequestError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': The new child element contains the parent.  which originates from line 7. what am i doing wrong?
[06:42:28] <Cork> stangeland: don't use for each on jquery
[06:42:38] <Cork> you will loop a lot more then just the array it contains
[06:42:40] <Cork> use .each
[06:43:04] <stangeland> Cork, ok i will...will that also solve the problem?
[06:43:22] <Cork> also define your variables
[06:43:31] <Cork> all the variables here are global
[06:43:55] <Cork> well except li
[06:44:08] <Cork> that is function local
[06:44:15] <Cork> (defined several times though)
[06:44:21] <BillCriswell> stangeland: Without looking I'd be careful using $('<li>'), try $('<li></li>')
[06:44:30] <BillCriswell> Well, without looking closely.
[06:44:47] <Cork> BillCriswell: uh, jquery has special code for handing $('<li>')
[06:44:52] <Cork> why would that be a problem?
[06:45:29] <stangeland> ahh that solved it
[06:45:39] <stangeland> the local variables
[06:45:44] <BillCriswell> I've seen $('<li/>') and $('<li></li>') used before Cork, but never just $('<li>').
[06:45:57] <BillCriswell> so it was mostly a shot in the dark.
[06:46:09] <BillCriswell> I think old IE fails on one of them?
[06:46:19] <Cork> BillCriswell: jquery search for <text>
[06:46:28] <Cork> and then just throw away all the junk after text
[06:46:34] <stangeland> i ended up with this: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/9687939/
[06:46:43] <Cork> then it uses the element name with document.createElement(elmName)
[06:47:01] <Cork> so space / and... a few other (if i remember correctly) has no effect
[06:48:36] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I know it can be picky on certain things.
[06:50:35] <DRSK> Cork » http://jsfiddle.net/xpb5tqk3/1/ any chance you could give me some pointers on how I could do this differently? I'm still stuck with the clones adding up weirdly even though this.value is e.g. 3 etc. You need to click 'Yes', then based on the input qty I want 2 of each input per qty selected. If I go "back" from 3 to 2 I'd want 4 inputs rather than 6. Any suggestions?
[06:52:54] <stangeland> ok, so i use this to create a tree list: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/9687967/ but how can i put a name on directories? (line 9)
[06:53:33] <Cork> BillCriswell: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=rsingleTag
[06:54:06] <BillCriswell> Cork: Oh bad ass.
[06:54:29] <BillCriswell> stangeland: $('<li>').text('something').append()
[06:54:36] <Cork> i always for get the name of that damn thing
[06:56:16] <Omar-> KOjs channel is dead
[06:56:27] <Omar-> nobody is there to help :/
[06:56:32] <stangeland> BillCriswell, ahh right - thats nice - and if i want to make all dirs collapseble by clicking? What is an easy way to do that?
[06:56:56] <Cork> DRSK: i would recommend checking the state of the checkbox instead of keeping a boolean around
[06:57:10] <Cork> as it can become out of sync and... ugg
[06:58:05] <DRSK> Cork » understood; however the issue I'm having problems with for now is the *clone* part - it's really confusing me. I'm trying to have a set of elements "for each qty", and have it match that qty at all times if you understand what I mean ;p
[06:58:23] <MeiR-> Hi Omar-, do you have in one of your jqm examples a google map with address search autocomplete?
[06:58:27] <Cork> ya, i'm giving feed back as i read through it
[06:58:48] <Cork> DRSK: also i think you can't do it as you're doing it
[06:58:50] <bl4ckdu5t> How can I immitate the .toggle() to handle a case where I want to switch the class .active on an element?
[06:58:51] <Cork> it breaks at the base
[06:58:57] <Omar-> MeiR- I can do one if you want
[06:59:19] <bl4ckdu5t> guess I'll just have to go through the if:hasClass process?
[06:59:20] <DRSK> Okay, understandable. What can I do?
[06:59:23] <Cork> DRSK: i recommend adding a div around the "base" div or something like that
[06:59:27] <MeiR-> Omar-, that'd be great! thanks :)
[06:59:30] <Cork> and have the first number of elements in there
[06:59:40] <Cork> then you append the new ones after the div
[06:59:51] <Cork> else you have no way of removing the new ones easily
[06:59:56] <Omar-> MeiR- all you have to do is setup  a fiddle and i'll take care of the rest ;)
[07:00:16] <MeiR-> ok i'll clean my current code
[07:00:24] <DRSK> Cork » so the div I have with a class of "custom-print" with a unique data-variation-id isn't enough?
[07:00:29] <Omar-> MeiR- ok :)
[07:00:40] <Cork> DRSK: no as you add the generated ones in the same div
[07:01:11] <MeiR-> Omar- will you be available in coming hour if i highlight your nicj?
[07:01:13] <MeiR-> nick*
[07:01:14] <Cork> DRSK: also the if statements at the end makes no sense
[07:01:29] <DRSK> Cork » to the same div they are supposed to be yeah, point being the fields for "XXL" are separate from the fields to show up in "XL" or "S" etc
[07:01:31] <MeiR-> or you prefer pm
[07:01:33] <Cork> DRSK: what it does is jQuery(customPrint).toggle($custom_print)
[07:01:39] <Cork> this.valeu has no effect
[07:02:02] <DRSK> Cork » this.value (I thought) was the qty number?
[07:02:13] <DRSK> or at least that's what console.log( this.value ) shows :o
[07:02:22] <Cork> ah wait i throught wrong
[07:02:26] <Cork> *thought
[07:02:41] <Omar-> MeiR- I might be AFK, just ping me and i'll check your msg
[07:02:46] <Cork> though the second if isn't needed
[07:03:15] <MeiR-> Omar-, wait, what do mean by setup a fiddle?
[07:03:17] <Omar-> in case i wasn't around, send me a memo (/memoserv send Omar- your message)
[07:03:26] <MeiR-> you want it clean under my username?
[07:03:31] <DRSK> ahh ok well ignore the fiddle Cork I was simply trying to put something together to work from. But I get the idea it's not a good base to build upon. Though I don't exactly know any other implementation of what I'm trying to do which basically is to spawn 2 input fields for each quantity provided _per_ size (in this case, XXL, XL, M etc).
[07:03:39] <Cork> DRSK: this will do the same thing http://jsfiddle.net/xpb5tqk3/2/
[07:04:09] <Omar-> MeiR- lol, I mean your HTML structure, JSON/Ajax connection, etc. and what you want to achieve
[07:04:30] <DRSK> Cork » ahh yeah. I figured since I have "2" always spawned at init I wanted to check yeah ignore my stupid gist I was merely trying to put *something* together to try and show what I actually was trying to accomplsih :p
[07:04:40] <Cork> DRSK: also clones is meant to be function local not global
[07:04:46] <MeiR-> basically, i don't have any special structure
[07:04:54] <MeiR-> i used your auto resized map
[07:05:08] <DRSK> ya I moved it outside to see if that was the reason it duplicated itself (or actually didn't match qty but exponentially added fields like a crazt person)
[07:05:09] <MeiR-> (assumming your "Palestinian")
[07:05:10] <DRSK> *y
[07:05:14] <MeiR-> your'e*
[07:05:23] <Omar-> MeiR- yea, that's me. Which one has you used?
[07:05:29] <Omar-> I have many examples
[07:05:41] <Omar-> I discover new things everyday
[07:06:09] <Omar-> have*
[07:06:35] <DRSK> Cork » any chance I could PM a link for you to check it out *not* fiddled but more of a real example? I'd love to get some suggestions how I could be doing this instead of trying to fix that broken code :p
[07:06:36] <Cork> DRSK: also why arn't you using id instead of data-variable-id
[07:06:43] <Cork> as you treat it as unique anyway
[07:06:45] <MeiR-> Omar-, this: http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/N6PAh/
[07:06:49] <Cork> just prefix it with something
[07:06:54] <Cork> would make selection cleaner
[07:07:06] <Cork> DRSK: i won't have time
[07:07:17] <MeiR-> and i don't need currently any ajax connection
[07:07:36] <MeiR-> just instead of the "hello" button at top right, a search input
[07:07:39] <Omar-> MeiR- this is a preloaded google map, do you want to preload google map before page is shown?
[07:07:53] <DRSK> Cork » all right no worries thanks for your feedback! Any idea how to make sure clone won't get out of control? Meaning how I can have clone.length correspond to the qty given?
[07:08:06] <MeiR-> yeah, because this way it renders perfectly when i load another pages
[07:08:32] <Cork> DRSK: for starters http://jsfiddle.net/xpb5tqk3/3/
[07:08:38] <MeiR-> the user will have a page with a list of addresses, and the map page
[07:08:47] <Cork> DRSK: then make sure customPrint actually finds the elements you expect
[07:08:58] <Cork> wait a min...
[07:09:07] <Cork> ugg how could i have missed this...
[07:09:10] <DRSK> Sure!
[07:09:20] <Omar-> MeiR- autocomplete usually reads from JSON or a saved array
[07:09:21] <Cork> DRSK: you didn't need the for loop to begin with
[07:09:23] <DRSK> I blame myself for showing you such an ugly idea ;p
[07:09:34] <MeiR-> Omar-, i mean google's autocomplete
[07:09:48] <MeiR-> that's why i have difficulties
[07:09:59] <Cork> hmm, ah, sorry yes you do
[07:10:07] <Cork> but you need to account for the elements you already have
[07:10:10] <Omar-> MeiR- hmmm..if it has API i'll go through it. send me a link if you have
[07:10:17] <DRSK> Cork » I only have 1 set of them for each size
[07:10:22] <Cork> and that is where things get ugly
[07:10:31] <DRSK> So yeah -1 I guess for starters?
[07:10:32] <DRSK> Oh
[07:10:41] <MeiR-> Omar- : https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete#address_forms
[07:11:58] <Omar-> MeiR- I'll read it, play around a bit
[07:12:17] <MeiR-> Omar- there's also the last section: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete#place_autocomplete_service
[07:12:50] <MeiR-> we can retrieve an array of predictions
[07:13:01] <DRSK> Cork » I just don't understand how it's multiplying. I tried changing this.value in the for-loop to this.value -1 so that it won't start cloning until we have at least 2 qty. But after 2 it gets to 8 and from 8 to 12 and then 48.. :S How? ^^
[07:13:58] <Omar-> MeiR- ok, i'll look into it
[07:14:15] <DRSK> Oh because clones are never "removed" but still? It must iterate it for every.. hm yeah I don't get it :) Thanks tho I guess I'll have to do some more investigation into a better approach for this :)
[07:14:19] <Omar-> I hope I manage to get it working in 2 hrs
[07:17:14] <Cork> DRSK: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/xpb5tqk3/4/
[07:18:22] <Cork> DRSK: the problem is that you clone the set of elements you have generated
[07:18:27] <Cork> so you don't have a stable base
[07:18:32] <Cork> also you never removed anything
[07:18:37] <Cork> and that is why things broke
[07:19:35] <DRSK> Ahh, I see what you did. That is exactly what I wanted Cork thank you! Only thing clonky now is the removal after 3 qty :)
[07:20:48] <Cork> ah, ya
[07:21:06] <Cork> -1 on line 29 needs to happen before the multiplication
[07:21:45] <Cork> you prob want to do a Math.min(0, this.value - 1)
[07:22:30] <Cork> LOL
[07:22:34] <Cork> i meant max >_<'
[07:22:39] <bl4ckdu5t> Why doesn't this get active http://jsfiddle.net/urtkL73q/
[07:22:55] <Cork> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/xpb5tqk3/5/
[07:23:36] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: what's wrong with $(this).toggleClass('active') ?
[07:23:48] <DRSK> You are so fast, haha thank you! I was still playing around with the -1 thing occuring before the multiplication. Thanks a lot Cork!
[07:23:52] <bl4ckdu5t> I never knew that exited
[07:24:01] <bl4ckdu5t> *existed
[07:24:19] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: also click can't bubble from svg to nav
[07:24:23] <Cork> so the handle can't EVER work
[07:24:54] <Cork> hmm actually you bind it on the container... that might actually work...
[07:25:09] <Cork> (me hate the cross document structure of svg)
[07:25:42] <bl4ckdu5t> but it still isn't http://jsfiddle.net/urtkL73q/1/
[07:26:55] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: btw don't ever ever do parents('nav').children
[07:27:05] <Cork> you want .closest('nav')
[07:27:38] <bl4ckdu5t> or .closesst('ul')
[07:27:56] <bl4ckdu5t> *closest()
[07:27:59] <Cork> no
[07:28:03] <Cork> ul isn't a parent of svg
[07:28:15] <Cork> .closets('nav').children('ul')
[07:28:27] <bl4ckdu5t> ok. Why is this?
[07:29:13] <Cork> "For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree."
[07:30:30] * bl4ckdu5t takes a note
[07:31:04] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: i would just do this http://jsfiddle.net/urtkL73q/3/
[07:31:17] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: the core of the problem is that <svg> is a replaced element
[07:31:32] <Cork> it is replaced by the external svg document
[07:31:39] <Cork> so jquery gets a bit confused
[07:31:42] <Cork> not sure why actually
[07:33:05] <bl4ckdu5t> ok that looks a lot better and shorter. Thanks
[07:37:57] <imNoob> hello
[07:38:04] <imNoob> get someone help me
[07:38:05] <imNoob> ?
[07:38:36] <imNoob> <div class="para1" style="position:absolute;right:0%;top:10%;background-color:black;">
[07:38:44] <imNoob> <script type="text/javascript"> $('.para1').transify(); </script>
[07:38:51] <imNoob> can someone tell me why top doesnt work?
[07:39:26] <Cork> ?paste
[07:39:26] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:39:40] <BillCriswell> imNoob: So many reasons outside of that code example can exist.
[07:40:47] <imNoob> billcriswell can you help me if i give you the entire code?
[07:40:52] <imNoob> its not huge
[07:40:57] <imNoob> for a small webpage
[07:41:39] <imNoob> i started coding a few days back so im a real noob
[07:41:57] <imNoob> and i started using jquery today
[07:44:55] <Cork> imNoob: just use one of the sites b-ot linked to
[07:45:20] <MeiR-> Omar-, thanks again! if you can please send me a pm afterwards
[07:45:28] <MeiR-> i don't have any highlight script
[07:46:07] <imNoob> cork the webpage looks completely different in that editor
[07:46:16] <imNoob> everything is out of position
[07:46:44] <Cork> imNoob: just paste what you have and we can start from there
[07:47:41] <imNoob> cork shall i register a domain with .tk and host it free? can u help me then?
[07:47:50] <Cork> uh
[07:47:56] <bl4ckdu5t> lol
[07:47:58] <Cork> imNoob: just paste the code in jsfiddle
[07:48:08] <bl4ckdu5t> like help to host?
[07:49:25] <imNoob> pasted. How do i show it to you?
[07:49:36] <imNoob> bl4ckdu5t: ?
[07:49:49] <imNoob> no i need help with the code
[07:49:54] <imNoob> im a noob xD
[07:49:55] <Cork> imNoob: just click save and paste the url here
[07:50:03] <imNoob> http://jsfiddle.net/k5z05Ldo/
[07:51:16] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/k5z05Ldo/1/
[07:52:07] <Cork> imNoob: you're linking to a lot of images that doesn't exist
[07:52:15] <Cork> and that is prob why it looks different to you
[07:52:45] <imNoob> o yea
[07:52:54] <imNoob> bnut why is everything out of position?
[07:52:56] <imNoob> but*
[07:53:40] <Cork> and cleaned up a bit http://jsfiddle.net/k5z05Ldo/2/
[07:54:12] <Cork> every thing looks like i would expect it
[07:54:19] <Cork> what is it you have problem with?
[07:54:40] <imNoob> hey top works in it
[07:54:53] <imNoob> the problem was with top
[07:54:56] <imNoob> its not working
[07:55:11] <Cork> well it works just fine here
[07:56:02] <Cork> imNoob: btw the reason we wanted it in jsfiddle is cause it makes it MUCH easier to do modifications to the code/markup
[07:56:17] <Cork> so digging into problems goes much faster
[07:56:22] <imNoob> yea and the code looks similar but doesnt work in my system
[07:57:25] <Cork> position top worked fine from the original code too
[07:57:32] <Cork> so it isn't most likely that
[08:00:57] <imNoob> Cork: thsi si what it looks like http://puu.sh/ecbhb/9642d165e9.jpg
[08:01:13] <imNoob> i wanna bring it below that menu bar
[08:01:35] <imNoob> but neither top nor bottom is working
[08:04:53] <Cork> imNoob: use dom inspector and inspect the element
[08:05:09] <Cork> i suspect the css you've added inline doesn't parse or something like that (missing ; ?)
[08:12:59] <imNoob> Cork: is there any way i can add a transparent image behind the para using only css and html? Actually i could do that when the image and the para were taken as separate elements and placing the image behind the para but i wanted both to be one single element. But when i took both as a single element the opacity that i applied to the image was being applied on the text too
[08:13:15] <imNoob> so i googled for a solution and found that plugin
[08:13:35] <Cork> imNoob: just set a background image
[08:14:03] <Cork> though you would have to put the transparency in the image for that to work
[08:14:05] <imNoob> but then i wont be able to control its transparency right?
[08:14:10] <Cork> right
[08:14:22] <Cork> only other option is to add a wrapping element around it
[08:14:33] <Cork> and then have two elements ontop each other
[08:15:41] <imNoob> :( That sounds complicated with my level of knowledge. I think i should go with your first solution xD
[08:16:19] <imNoob> Thanks for helping Cork :)
[08:17:33] <Cork> imNoob: http://jsfiddle.net/acrw8gvt/
[08:18:04] <Cork> that said :)
[08:18:23] <Cork> this is more a question for #css then #jquery
[08:18:35] <Cork> and you might want to take future questions like this there
[08:19:52] <imNoob> sorry my bad
[08:20:00] <imNoob> thx Cork :))
[08:20:30] <Cork> no problem, everyone have to be new at one time
[08:36:27] <giraffedev> Ey guys, got a question.
[08:36:44] <giraffedev> How should vars be usualy named? camelCase?
[08:36:59] <robertmaxrees> depends on the var :)
[08:37:15] <giraffedev> Looking for best practices tips.
[08:37:20] <giraffedev> Could you give me a few examples?
[08:37:25] <robertmaxrees> your constructor functions are usually TitleCase, normal vars camelCase, and constants in ALLCAPS
[08:37:41] <cjohnson> depends on your code base and existing conventions as well
[08:37:45] <robertmaxrees> ^ this too.
[08:37:55] <robertmaxrees> if your codebase has a preexisting convention, go with that.
[08:38:09] <giraffedev> Well, it doesn't.
[08:38:12] <giraffedev> Looking for tips for future work.
[08:38:15] <giraffedev> ^^
[08:38:15] <cjohnson> cool, make one up!
[08:38:22] <giraffedev> Haha
[08:38:30] <cjohnson> I like putting thirteen underscores before every variable
[08:38:37] <wovenhead> Is it possible to scrape google search results from my own domain/webpage using jquery/Ajax, or will that cause CORS problems?
[08:38:39] <cjohnson> makes my code lucky
[08:38:45] <giraffedev> Haha !
[08:38:49] <robertmaxrees> wovenhead CORS and legal issues...
[08:38:51] <giraffedev> Well, that could be an idea.
[08:38:56] <robertmaxrees> wovenhead why are you scraping google?
[08:39:21] <NoiseEee> doesn't Google have a search API?
[08:39:24] <wovenhead> robertmaxrees hmmm we need a short-term solution for a prototype
[08:39:43] <NoiseEee> wovenhead: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview
[08:39:43] <robertmaxrees> what sort of prototype?
[08:39:50] <wovenhead> well what we're doing is actually not google search but something different
[08:40:13] <wovenhead> I would expect the behavior to be the same, but it also requires a POST request
[08:40:34] <wovenhead> yeah, otherwise I would user their API
[08:40:58] <robertmaxrees> what are you using their search for then?
[08:41:22] <mooncup> 17:39 < NoiseEee> doesn't Google have a search API?
[08:41:22] <wovenhead> I cannot actually say.
[08:41:28] <mooncup> they turned it off quite recently I think
[08:41:30] <mooncup> or at least a version of it
[08:41:33] <mooncup> loads of irc bots broke
[08:41:48] <robertmaxrees> !g google search api
[08:41:49] <NoiseEee> mooncup: hmmm, really?  not just a switch to SSL only or something?
[08:41:50] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Custom Search JSON/Atom API - Google Developers → https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview
[08:41:55] <wovenhead> If a service allows CORS, I will see that in a header request, right?
[08:42:10] <robertmaxrees> wovenhead you'll get a denial message if they don't allow CORS.
[08:42:30] <mooncup> NoiseEee: possibly
[08:42:32] <wovenhead> robertmaxrees is that something I can test with CURL?
[08:42:42] <wovenhead> command-line curl I mean
[08:42:45] <mooncup> I only know quite a few channels I'm in have changed search engines because of recent api issues
[08:42:46] <robertmaxrees> wovenhead not 100% accurately. use a browser to test.
[08:43:06] <robertmaxrees> mooncup the bot in here still works with google just fine.
[08:43:09] <wovenhead> robertmaxrees Okay. So if I get a denial message through my browser I'll know they disallow it
[08:43:17] <robertmaxrees> wovenhead yep.
[08:43:36] <wovenhead> robertmaxrees but I have to allow it on my site as well first? Is that right?
[08:43:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[08:43:48] <robertmaxrees> once your page has loaded, it's there.
[08:43:48] <wovenhead> Ah okay.
[08:43:55] <robertmaxrees> the other domain is the part that matters at that point.
[08:44:15] <wovenhead> right, I've been confused about that before, it's nice to get that cleared up
[08:45:07] <wovenhead> so when I have CORS blocking me the only work-around is to make requests in a seperate server process, right?
[08:45:16] <robertmaxrees> from a server, yeah.
[08:45:42] <wovenhead> yeah, alright, at least I know I can do it.
[08:46:32] <robertmaxrees> the entire thing is to prevent the scenario where you go to a malicious site and they submit an ajax request to, say, mail.google.com, which would likely be under your account.
[08:46:51] <wovenhead> ah, right, I should know that...
[08:47:08] <wovenhead> I have a pentest interview friday XD
[08:58:09] <_DB> sup guys
[08:58:21] <_DB> whats the best way to redirect a user to a page after a ajax request?
[08:58:42] <robertmaxrees> set the window.location in the .done() callback
[08:58:53] <_DB> I was using location.reload() but now I have to direct the user to 2 different urls
[08:59:15] <_DB> that wont allow them to use the back button?
[08:59:21] <robertmaxrees> window.location = "http://someURL.com";
[08:59:22] <robertmaxrees> sure it will.
[09:00:55] <robertmaxrees> you're inserting a new entry to your history at that point.
[09:20:08] <epepepep> Our University is experiencing a 100% packet loss to MaxCDN which is hosting code.jquery.com.  We asked around, and found another New Jersey University in the same situation.  MaxCDN hasn't been very helpful in troubleshooting the problem, though.  Does anyone know if there is a non-MaxCDN hosting provider for code.jquery.com that we can point to until the issue is resolved?  If there is someone here on the jquery team, I'd be glad to talk more about the issue
[09:21:12] <robertmaxrees> you want a new cdn for jquery?
[09:21:28] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery
[09:21:31] <epepepep> or the source for the CDN that we can point to during the outage.
[09:22:00] <robertmaxrees> just use another CDN - i just linked the one from google.
[09:22:19] <epepepep> robertmaxrees: awesome, thank you!
[09:22:35] <robertmaxrees> you can also host the file yourself if you want :)
[09:23:05] <epepepep> robertmaxrees: that was my first suggestion, but our developers say that isn't "best practice".  Seems we might have a difference of opinion.
[09:23:36] <greyhat> hey guys, i have this jquery code https://dpaste.de/XauC the fields that should be disabled on the change arent being disabled
[09:23:39] <robertmaxrees> well, there really isn't a singular "best practice" with something like that, but I'll let them do their thing :)
[09:24:16] <robertmaxrees> greyhat can you setup a fiddle with your markup?
[09:24:28] <epepepep> robertmaxrees: thanks.  I've been thinking about using mod_proxy with apache to keep a cached local version of the js files.  They said that they are using Drupal modules that have been hardcoded and would have to edit them every time there is an update.
[09:24:35] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: yeah i'll try
[09:25:20] <robertmaxrees> epepepep we store local copies here no matter what, but that's partially because we didn't want the extra DNS lookup and it gives us flexibility wrt minifying stuff.
[09:26:16] <epepepep> robertmaxrees: that sounds like very good reasons to have local files, and I agree with that reasoning.  I have to find some documentation suggesting to do that, maybe they'll respond to that.
[09:28:30] <varchar> epepepep, http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/fallback-for-cdn-hosted-jquery/
[09:29:03] <epepepep> varchar: awesome, thank you!
[09:29:56] <robertmaxrees> that looks... flaky to me.
[09:30:40] <varchar> robertmaxrees, you think so?
[09:31:22] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing to guarantee that the script finishes loading/fails to load before moving to that second script tag, though i could be wrong.
[09:31:28] <epepepep> One question comes to mind, won't the browser be stuck loading?
[09:32:07] <greyhat> jsfiddlle doesnt seem to have jquery 1.11.x - i'm using google's hosted jquery, should i be using 2.x.x?
[09:32:14] <epepepep> at least, that is out current situation with MaxCDN.  We can't get there, so the webpage just waits saying it is trying to load the .js file.
[09:32:19] <greyhat> very new to jquery
[09:33:23] <epepepep> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5506425/how-to-set-a-timeout-for-loading-a-external-javascript-file-which-is-down
[09:33:40] <epepepep> That has some code around it to do a timeout for the remote source file.
[09:34:07] <robertmaxrees> greyhat 1.x vs 2.x is all about browser support.
[09:34:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/browser-support/ for more info.
[09:35:23] <robertmaxrees> greyhat and jsfiddle has 1.11.0
[09:38:04] <greyhat> http://jsfiddle.net/ma8m9yxa/1/
[09:39:19] <robertmaxrees> greyhat okay - so how do I replicate the problem?
[09:39:45] <greyhat> if you change the department dropdown
[09:39:52] <greyhat> it should disable everything but project
[09:40:00] <greyhat> but it doesnt
[09:41:03] <robertmaxrees> that's simple - $(this) isn't what you think it is in that $.each()
[09:41:16] <robertmaxrees> use a native for loop for .forEach() for arrays instead.
[09:42:45] <Valduare> anyone around that works with bootstrap- I am trying to launch a modal toa specific tab in the modal…. cant get my code working
[09:42:49] <Valduare> not much on google about doing this
[09:43:26] <robertmaxrees> Valduare try in ##bootstrap
[09:43:53] <Valduare> I have
[09:43:55] <robertmaxrees> greyhat http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ma8m9yxa/2/
[09:43:56] <Valduare> its dead
[09:43:58] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: so disabled_children.foreach(function () { .... etc ....   ?
[09:44:15] <Valduare> its a jquery solution more or less anyways from what I see on google to do this
[09:44:30] <robertmaxrees> greyhat basically, as long as you don't need IE9 and below support.
[09:44:56] <robertmaxrees> greyhat though it'd be much smarter to just do something like var $inputs = $('.someClass'); instead.
[09:45:11] <robertmaxrees> and then you can $inputs.prop('disabled', true);
[09:46:44] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: i threw a console.log(this) out and am getting the expected strings
[09:47:07] <greyhat> *out -> in the disable function
[09:47:55] <greyhat> what did you mean by it isn't what i think it is
[09:49:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ma8m9yxa/3/
[09:49:46] <robertmaxrees> look at your console.
[09:50:52] <greyhat> String [ "i", "d", "_", "a", "p", "p" ]
[09:50:55] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[09:50:56] <greyhat> why is it doing that
[09:51:05] <greyhat> what is that
[09:51:24] <robertmaxrees> welcome this the nature of `this` in js :)
[09:51:33] <robertmaxrees> just use a native iterator/enumerator.
[09:51:48] <robertmaxrees> or create your jquery collection up front, which will wind up being much more performant.
[09:52:32] <greyhat> i'll use the native iterator, but i want to understand what this string[] thing is, and what do you mean create the collection up front
[09:53:33] <robertmaxrees> can you give all the relevant inputs a class?
[09:55:42] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ma8m9yxa/4/
[09:56:05] <robertmaxrees> (that's not exactly what you want but should get the idea across)
[09:59:42] <robertmaxrees> greyhat does that make sense?
[10:01:09] <greyhat> sorry just came back. yeah. can i do something like .concat with that?
[10:01:20] <robertmaxrees> you can use .add()
[10:01:24] <robertmaxrees> but you shouldn't need to.
[10:01:51] <greyhat> well i mean if i just change all my lists to jquery like you have $allinputs
[10:01:56] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: heres my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/5WrtE/9/   this is what I cant get to work.
[10:02:14] <robertmaxrees> greyhat that's what you want in this case.  otherwise you're doing a bunch of extra, unnecessary work.
[10:02:31] <greyhat> right but the way i have it set up i'll need .add
[10:02:42] <robertmaxrees> greyhat why do you have it setup that way?
[10:02:45] <greyhat> or to do a bunch of retyping of id selectors :)
[10:02:49] <Valduare> sorry this one robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/5WrtE/10/
[10:03:37] <robertmaxrees> Valduare i'm not really familiar enough with bootstrap to be of much help right now.  i'd really suggest waiting it out in the bootstrap channel.
[10:03:50] <Valduare> this is jquery / javascript issue
[10:03:51] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: because if a dependency changes i only have to change it once, instead of explicitly defining each set
[10:03:58] <robertmaxrees> Valduare that relies on jquery
[10:04:13] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: and because they are logically dependent in the code
[10:04:15] <robertmaxrees> greyhat something here smells to me.
[10:04:28] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[10:04:36] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: you would explicitly define each list
[10:04:37] <greyhat> ?
[10:04:49] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you need all of those arrays in the first place.
[10:05:08] <greyhat> ahh
[10:05:16] <greyhat> i havent written the rest of my code yet
[10:05:28] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're overcomplicating the setup imo.
[10:05:48] <greyhat> changing department enables project, changing project enables app, changing app enables everything but integer and name
[10:06:06] <robertmaxrees> greyhat you want to build a validator.
[10:06:13] <greyhat> no
[10:06:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:06:22] <greyhat> listen
[10:06:28] <greyhat> the code you saw isn't everything
[10:06:29] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what you're making :)
[10:06:32] <robertmaxrees> i know it isn't.
[10:06:38] <robertmaxrees> but what you just described is a basic validator.
[10:06:52] <greyhat> oh sorry
[10:07:16] <greyhat> i mistook your meaning i suppose
[10:07:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:07:30] <greyhat> the fields are only populated once the previous selection is made
[10:07:35] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:07:43] <greyhat> so until then they are disabled
[10:07:49] <greyhat> is there some better way to do this
[10:08:01] <greyhat> than the... validation tree i have created with arrays
[10:08:16] <greyhat> my population from the database code is working
[10:08:22] <greyhat> i just had to add the disable piece
[10:08:47] <robertmaxrees> first off, don't rely on arrays of strings to represent jquery object like that.
[10:08:53] <robertmaxrees> give things classes instead.
[10:08:58] <robertmaxrees> and select on those classes.
[10:09:25] <robertmaxrees> becuase otherwise you're really tightly coupling together your JS and markup and making things really hard to read and understand.
[10:11:25] <greyhat> makes sense, i was being lazy... django generates those field ids automatically... would have to manually generate classes :P
[10:12:07] <stangeland> is there a good jquery structure that allows me to easily add and remove strings? I only want each string to be present in the structure once, so i would like to be able to do struct.add(mystr) and struct.remove(mystr)
[10:12:14] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:12:22] <robertmaxrees> strange what's a "structure"?
[10:12:40] <stangeland> like array or dictionary or hashtable or whatever
[10:12:41] <robertmaxrees> err, stangeland
[10:12:52] <robertmaxrees> can you paste up an example?
[10:13:24] <stangeland> no
[10:13:28] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:13:35] <greyhat> stangeland: if you're looking for a unique-only structure, it sounds like you need a set
[10:13:38] <BillCriswell> stangeland: Not feasible.
[10:13:45] <robertmaxrees> okay.  you'll want to use an array with a dedupe function.
[10:13:49] <greyhat> which i know is present in python but idk about js
[10:13:56] <stangeland> greyhat, yeah, is there a set available in jquery?
[10:14:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:14:06] <stangeland> meh :S
[10:14:09] <BillCriswell> You can just use an object.
[10:14:17] <robertmaxrees> JS has objects and arrays.
[10:14:18] <stangeland> BillCriswell, how so?
[10:14:49] <BillCriswell> obj['some string'] = true; obj['some string'] = true; obj['some string'] = true; Object.keys(obj);
[10:14:58] <greyhat> stangeland: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4343746/is-there-a-data-structure-like-the-java-set-in-javascript
[10:14:58] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[10:15:06] <robertmaxrees> that's a hacky way to do it, but clever.
[10:15:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd just check the array for duplicates before inserting values.
[10:16:02] <BillCriswell> Yeah.. there must be a good reason not to do that.
[10:16:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue you're munging the purpose of properties on objects.
[10:16:35] <greyhat> actually the stackoverflow answer basically does exactly what BillCriswell said
[10:16:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:16:46] <BillCriswell> if (array.indexOf(stringJawn) > -1) { array.push(stringJawn); }
[10:17:10] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: who cares if you're mungling? any respectable language should have sets :P
[10:17:11] <robertmaxrees> iirc Array.indexOf() is IE10 and above only.
[10:17:29] <robertmaxrees> greyhat because it drives people like me nuts and only confuses us.
[10:17:30] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Ick
[10:17:31] <stangeland> greyhat, i agree
[10:17:40] <stangeland> kinda sucky that js dont have set
[10:17:41] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Nope, 9!
[10:17:45] <BillCriswell> Phew.
[10:17:47] <robertmaxrees> and js is a perfectly "respectable" language. people just expect it to do things it isn't designed to do ;)
[10:17:55] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell hah, that means i still can't use it.
[10:18:07] <greyhat> they expect that because it's used like a real language these days
[10:18:19] <robertmaxrees> greyhat we definitely do, and it is!
[10:18:20] <robertmaxrees> it
[10:18:33] <robertmaxrees> *it's plenty capable imo.
[10:18:38] <BillCriswell> I still think just checking for it before you add it is your best bet.
[10:18:40] <greyhat> i think we can all agree it's better than php
[10:18:46] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell++ agreed.
[10:18:59] <robertmaxrees> and coldfusion.
[10:19:20] <BillCriswell> phpfusion was great though.
[10:19:44] <BillCriswell> I hope you all googled that.
[10:19:49] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[10:19:54] <stangeland> o well....sth for my std lib of missing js features ;) http://jsfiddle.net/ap1dem35/3/
[10:20:14] <robertmaxrees> :(just
[10:20:26] <robertmaxrees> *just use an array and check it for that value before pushing it in.
[10:21:12] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE THIS
[10:21:15] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, yeah but i need to be able to do a.remove also
[10:21:31] <BillCriswell> So splice that shit
[10:21:38] <BillCriswell> You're looking for the index anyway.
[10:21:41] <robertmaxrees> stangeland then write convenience functions to do the removals.
[10:21:49] <wodim> ok
[10:22:00] <stangeland> sure but then why not just use: http://jsfiddle.net/ap1dem35/3/ instead
[10:22:34] <robertmaxrees> because now you're abusing what objects were designed to do and will confuse the hell out of other devs.
[10:23:41] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, function is called StringSet <---- thats pretty easy to understand id say
[10:23:51] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[10:24:19] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to shoehorn in behavior that the language doesn't provide in a way that isn't very clear.
[10:24:27] <robertmaxrees> but you're not going to listen so enjoy ;)
[10:26:45] <varchar> lol
[10:28:02] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: this is what i ended up with http://jsfiddle.net/ma8m9yxa/6/
[10:28:26] <greyhat> stangeland: you could do the same thing without abusing objects
[10:28:47] <robertmaxrees> greyhat you don't need $.each() in that case.
[10:28:50] <robertmaxrees> in fact, you shouldn't use it.
[10:29:00] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm i see what you're doing.
[10:29:01] <robertmaxrees> not bad.
[10:29:08] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, i am actually listening...and implemention convenience fcs for array instead
[10:29:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd still reconsider the way you're grouping those vars, buuut...
[10:29:24] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: the disablement still isnt enabled
[10:30:18] <robertmaxrees> stangeland "fcs"?
[10:30:28] <stangeland> fcs = functions
[10:30:39] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[10:31:41] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: i have to go to a mtg but if you would care to message me with why the disable is failing i would appreciate it :p and thanks so much for all your help so far
[10:32:14] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:33:28] <robertmaxrees> console.log() is your best friend: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ma8m9yxa/7/
[10:33:49] <robertmaxrees> that's why you don't do things the way you currently are.
[10:40:09] <stangeland> ok, it aint pretty but this is what i ended up doing instead of using a set. http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/9689011/   any comments ?
[10:41:39] <robertmaxrees> don't use $.each() for jquery objects.
[10:41:52] <stangeland> for then should i use
[10:42:09] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('li').find('.pfile').each();
[10:42:20] <stangeland> oh
[10:42:28] <robertmaxrees> there's a distinction between the two.
[10:42:39] <stangeland> nice
[10:42:49] <stangeland> they do the same though?
[10:42:53] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:43:11] <stangeland> whats the diff?
[10:43:16] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/ - "The $.each() function is not the same as $(selector).each(), which is used to iterate, exclusively, over a jQuery object."
[10:43:25] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for more info.
[10:43:38] <robertmaxrees> also i'd collapse down your conditionals.
[10:44:00] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, how so
[10:44:26] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/etp7wyj/
[10:45:02] <stangeland> hmmm yeah
[10:45:13] <pentagrass> How do you define functions that return objects(?) to use with call chaining: foo().position("-11px");
[10:45:30] <pentagrass> how would foo be defined?
[10:45:30] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, good comments. thx
[10:45:31] <robertmaxrees> pentagrass you return the relevant jquery object our of it.
[10:45:44] <robertmaxrees> stangeland finally, cache $(this).closest('li') - let me show you.
[10:46:27] <robertmaxrees> stangeland also, why are you removing things in there?
[10:46:35] <robertmaxrees> you're removing things that already exist.
[10:47:00] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, because if the user deselects the item it should be removed from the collection
[10:47:05] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[10:47:16] <pentagrass> I know this is OT, but does anybody know what Adobe calls their RTMP server?
[10:47:29] <pentagrass> nvm
[10:47:29] <pentagrass> nvm
[10:47:33] <robertmaxrees> stangeland http://fixee.org/paste/etp7wyj/#url=x74pyi0 this cleans things up a little more.
[10:47:48] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, its a file treeview where user can select/deselect dirs and files
[10:48:45] <robertmaxrees> even further: fixee.org/paste/etp7wyj/#url=x74pyi0

[11:10:50] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, so I'm using jQuery's $.when for the first time to run a function after both an $.ajax and event are finished. Is there any way make it so at least in the event, under a certain condition it won't execute what's in my $.when function? I thought returning false would do it but it didn't. Code's here: https://www.refheap.com/95846
[11:11:18] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy that's not how deferreds work.
[11:11:38] <DeltaHeavy> What should I be doing instead then?
[11:11:40] <robertmaxrees> var eventLoadMagnifiedImage = $(magnifiedImage).on('load', function () {}); is immediately returning a value.
[11:12:44] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're working through, DeltaHeavy?
[11:13:31] <DeltaHeavy> Basically I want to activate another pane in my UI after BOTH an image is done loading, and I get some text from an XHR response.
[11:13:45] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be a massive pita.
[11:13:52] <robertmaxrees> because image loading stuff is special.
[11:14:06] <robertmaxrees> you want to use $('img').load(); instead for that.
[11:14:18] <DeltaHeavy> I can already successfully trigger a function after an image is loaded
[11:14:51] <DeltaHeavy> This is the whole method: https://www.refheap.com/9dc8ea1394a05ebd8cc799de4
[11:14:53] <DeltaHeavy> In progress
[11:15:19] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you need to create a new promise object that you then manually resolve in that event handler.
[11:15:54] <DeltaHeavy> No idea what that means. Should I just spend some time reading up on promises? I know what they do but I don't know how they're applied in the code itself.
[11:15:55] <BillCriswell> Yeah I was going to say some deferred action can work.
[11:15:58] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[11:17:18] <robertmaxrees> something like this: http://fixee.org/paste/ursxvqn/
[11:17:51] <BillCriswell> Then some sweet .when action.
[11:18:09] <BillCriswell> Work is boring today.
[11:18:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, he's got the $.when() hooked up, just needs to move where he's doing thangs.
[11:18:35] <DeltaHeavy> Now it's clicking
[11:19:20] <BillCriswell> The best feeling in the world is when it clicks.
[11:19:24] <BillCriswell> Well... second.
[11:19:29] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[11:19:33] <BillCriswell> Maybe third, but it's damn good.
[11:28:25] <greyhat> robertmaxrees: thanks again for all your help http://jsfiddle.net/ma8m9yxa/8/
[11:29:06] <phelix> If I am doing something ilke so.
[11:29:36] <phelix> ('#supplyContainer').on('click', ' .add_button', function() { nids.push($(this).attr('data-nid')); } how can I go about accessing the values of nids outside of that function inside another one?
[11:30:05] <BillCriswell> phelix: If it's defined outside of the function you should be cool.
[11:30:21] <BillCriswell> Just use it.
[11:30:23] <phelix> well before the function I have a var nids = []
[11:30:36] <BillCriswell> phelix: Yeah, then you can use nids anywhere in that scope.
[11:30:51] <phelix> but you have to click an item to add a new item to the array. not sure that is updating that value so it can be grabbed from something outside that function?
[11:31:02] <BillCriswell> phelix: It can.
[11:31:08] <phelix> k let me try thanks
[11:31:32] <RavinduL> Hi people! How do I show an element's :after section in jquery?
[11:31:43] <BillCriswell> phelix: Small tip, totally unrelated. You should do $(this).data('nid');
[11:32:37] <BillCriswell> RavinduL: You'd have to toggle a class on the element in order to hide or unhide an pseudo element.
[11:32:51] <phelix> ahh ok thanks
[11:33:50] <BillCriswell> RavinduL: Something like... .hide-before:before, .hide-after:after { display: none; } then just toggle the hide-before and hide-after classes on the elements.
[11:34:24] <BillCriswell> RavinduL: If I'm understanding you correctly.
[11:34:26] <RavinduL> BillCriswell: Is there no way to do it in jquery?
[11:34:45] <RavinduL> BillCriswell: Like $("#element:after").show()
[11:35:07] <BillCriswell> RavinduL: Not as far as I know.
[11:35:16] <RavinduL> BillCriswell: Thanks (y)
[11:35:18] <BillCriswell> They're "shadow dom"
[11:35:28] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[11:36:07] <BillCriswell> RavinduL: It's much easier toggling classes anyway in the long run so I wouldn't worry about it.
[11:38:13] <RavinduL> BillCriswell: Is there a way to toggleClass() with a transition?
[11:39:15] <BillCriswell> RavinduL: If you need old browser support jQuery UI overloads toggleClass() to animate I believe, but if you're good with newer browsers working you can just put .foo { transition: prop 0.4s; } or something.
[11:39:48] <BillCriswell> you're good with just newer browsers working*
[11:40:10] <RavinduL> BillCriswell: LOL how did that go over my head? Thanks man :)
[11:40:19] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:10:44] <Alina-malina> i cant addClass to $('#myID"') :-/
[12:10:57] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[12:11:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h5exv0Ld/
[12:11:58] <Alina-malina> even to <tr>  ?
[12:12:03] <Alina-malina> it is <tr> not div
[12:12:18] <robertmaxrees> addClass doesn't care about what the target is.
[12:12:20] <NoiseEee> Alina-malina: you can add a class to whatever you want
[12:13:06] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h5exv0Ld/3/
[12:13:08] <Alina-malina> http://jsfiddle.net/h5exv0Ld/2/  then why it doesnt?
[12:13:27] <robertmaxrees> because css borders and tables don't mix.
[12:13:30] <robertmaxrees> and that's not valid HTML/.
[12:13:37] <Alina-malina> hmmm
[12:13:46] <robertmaxrees> see my example.
[12:14:42] <Alina-malina> http://jsfiddle.net/h5exv0Ld/5/  please look at my javascript part
[12:14:54] <NoiseEee> Alina-malina: add the border to target the <td>
[12:15:51] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h5exv0Ld/7/
[12:15:53] <NoiseEee> Alina-malina: http://jsfiddle.net/h5exv0Ld/6/ learn 2 produce valid html, update your class names, etc etc
[12:16:04] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:16:27] <NoiseEee> but waiit!!
[12:16:29] <NoiseEee> jk
[12:16:42] <robertmaxrees> boom
[12:16:49] <Alina-malina> hmmm just a moment please
[12:26:30] <strayArch> https://bpaste.net/show/90519892a573 where did I mess my syntax up ;_;
[12:27:04] <robertmaxrees> $(a).on('click', paddingAdjust(span, ul));
[12:27:07] <robertmaxrees> can't do that.
[12:27:22] <robertmaxrees> $(a).on('click', paddingAdjust); is kosher.
[12:27:54] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: So, I can't pass values?
[12:28:01] <robertmaxrees> you can, but not like that.
[12:28:11] <robertmaxrees> your original version is running the paddingAdjust() function immediately and then assigning the return to the handler.
[12:28:21] <NoiseEee> strayArch: $(a).on('click',function() { paddingAdjust(a,b); });
[12:28:37] <Alina-malina> ah wonderful it works, i used wrong id name for my tr:) thanks for your help NoiseEee robertmaxrees :)
[12:28:38] <NoiseEee> but we'll assume that a/b, or "span" "ul" is defined beforehandm yes?
[12:28:49] <robertmaxrees> or $(a).on('click', paddingAdjust, {data, ul});
[12:28:50] <strayArch> NoiseEee: Yes
[12:28:56] <robertmaxrees> or you can use .bind() or .call()
[12:29:24] <NoiseEee> robertmaxrees: interesting, i've never done/seen that
[12:29:43] <strayArch> What would be the 'best' way. Or are they all equal?
[12:30:01] <robertmaxrees> $(a).on('click', paddingAdjust.bind(this, data, ui)); iirc.
[12:30:09] <robertmaxrees> and it totally depends on what you're most comfortable with.
[12:30:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid the anonymous function if possible.
[12:30:27] <NoiseEee> yeah robertmaxrees?
[12:30:29] <robertmaxrees> check out passind the data object instead.
[12:30:43] <NoiseEee> hmm i'll look into that too.
[12:30:52] <robertmaxrees> you're creating an extra scope you don't really need - if you have extra data to shove in, use the data arg for .on() :)
[12:31:09] <robertmaxrees> doesn't necessarily hurt anything, but it isn't all that necessary.
[12:31:18] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: Makes sense, I'll give it a try
[12:31:35] <robertmaxrees> anything passed in through that object will be in event.data within your handler.
[12:31:46] <robertmaxrees> event.data.data and event.data.ui in your case.
[12:31:58] <robertmaxrees> so you instead pass the event objkect to the handler and blah blah blah
[12:34:59] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: https://bpaste.net/show/3f507d16ea48  This doesn't seem to work in action :3
[12:35:32] <robertmaxrees> right - reread what I said.
[12:35:50] <robertmaxrees> those aren't passed as params to the function still.  they're in the event object.
[12:36:44] <NoiseEee> robertmaxrees: but wouldn't you want to use the anon function way, just so you don't have to adjust the "paddingAdjust" function, and that it can be (re)used without requiring an event?
[12:37:02] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: removing the params doesn't work anyway :S
[12:37:05] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee then use .bind()/.call() for it.
[12:37:11] <robertmaxrees> strayArch one sec - you're misunderstanding.
[12:37:17] <NoiseEee> robertmaxrees: right
[12:37:34] <strayArch> xD no surprise there :)
[12:38:52] <guideX> is there a way to remove !important from css?
[12:39:11] <guideX> .. using jquery
[12:39:17] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/yhu0yLer/ @ strayArch
[12:39:23] <robertmaxrees> strayArch http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8abmvc8t/
[12:39:24] <NoiseEee> thanks robertmaxrees, had no idea
[12:39:35] <robertmaxrees> :D
[12:40:11] <robertmaxrees> that .bind() thing is super useful when you want to create an object that contains all your methods and data, but don't want to juggle `this` internall.
[12:40:29] <BillCriswell> That's ie9 plus, right?
[12:40:48] <NoiseEee> robertmaxrees: yeah i find most often I $.proxy(anonFunction,this) to deal with that
[12:40:48] <robertmaxrees> .bind() ?  yep.
[12:41:04] <NoiseEee> same tomato different tomato or something
[12:41:11] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:41:43] <robertmaxrees> underscore offers some ways to do that, too.
[12:41:56] <BillCriswell> You can pass the data onto the event through .on() as well.
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell that's what my version does.
[12:42:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8abmvc8t/ - this guy
[12:42:42] <BillCriswell> Ah didn't see that.
[12:43:02] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: I forked it for the future ^_^
[12:43:02] <BillCriswell> With the .bind() way to do you lose the event?
[12:43:32] <strayArch> NoiseEee: thanks works like a charm :D
[12:44:23] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell nope - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yhu0yLer/1/
[12:44:30] <robertmaxrees> it's passed as the last argument to the callback in that case.
[12:44:43] <robertmaxrees> jquery is using .apply() under the hood on that callback.
[12:45:16] <BillCriswell> That seems confusing?
[12:45:44] <robertmaxrees> it can be - just remember that e is still optional and will always be the last callback.
[12:45:50] <robertmaxrees> *param of thje callback
[12:46:14] <BillCriswell> Yeah I can remember that, the dude looking at it next might be a bit lost haha
[12:46:51] <robertmaxrees> :) we're starting to do stuff that's more an more like that in our frontend, but using underscore's bind() which clues folks in that something interesting is going on.
[12:50:06] <strayArch> http://jsfiddle.net/jstronz2/hL0fn9vb/5/   <--- doesn't work, but it works fine on my website.  Why would that be?
[12:51:22] <robertmaxrees> doing some scope juggling there.
[12:51:29] <ericincoldohio> Thanks for your help robertmax, a comment you made helped me figure out my drag/drop issue
[12:52:05] <robertmaxrees> fsho!  glad i could be a rubber duck!
[12:53:30] <robertmaxrees> strayArch also, window.onload might not be what you're expecting in the fiddle.
[12:54:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest using a jquery document ready or something comparable instead.
[12:58:21] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: Will do, that is there from the original code
[12:58:31] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[12:59:24] <strayArch> is "this.sitemapstyler" okay or should it be "$(this).sitemapstyler" line 20
[12:59:43] <robertmaxrees> var sitemapstyle = function() {
[12:59:57] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you're using this.sitemapstyler in there.
[13:00:37] <strayArch> leftovers from original code
[13:00:52] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is usually used in jquery callbacks to refer to the jquery-fied DOM node.
[13:01:36] <strayArch> Yeah, I was thrown off by the "this." useage. Line 23 should be var?
[13:01:53] <strayArch> "var listItem"
[13:02:06] <robertmaxrees> the `this` object in that context will be the window - use var sitemapstyler = function() {} instead.
[13:04:17] <strayArch> http://jsfiddle.net/jstronz2/hL0fn9vb/6/
[13:04:36] <robertmaxrees> no need to .bind() in that doc ready.
[13:04:37] <strayArch> ^I think I got things right --- checking
[13:04:43] <strayArch> ah
[13:04:51] <robertmaxrees> the this object is already there.
[13:14:18] <strayArch> https://bpaste.net/show/0bf0ca019e91 changing 21 from this to $(this) and 49 to $(document).ready( sitemapstyler;); --- break the script
[13:14:42] <robertmaxrees> don't randomly swap this to $(this)
[13:15:00] <robertmaxrees> var listItem = function
[13:15:44] <robertmaxrees> actually, there's a larger issue here hah
[13:16:36] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/881iiwk/ do this.
[13:17:01] <robertmaxrees> they were using this.varName because you can't technically create vars in if statements.
[13:18:09] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: ahh, so create them outside of the if?
[13:18:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah see what I did in that fixee?
[13:20:12] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: that makes sense. It does assume that sitemap exists, but that's fine
[13:20:22] <robertmaxrees> you were doing that before anyway.
[13:20:42] <strayArch> if(sitemap) checks it?
[13:20:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:21:19] <robertmaxrees> but that has nothing to do with the code in the function.
[13:22:08] <strayArch> true, why " var ul... var a" work?
[13:22:12] <strayArch> why do*
[13:22:25] <robertmaxrees> those technically shouldn't be in that if either.
[13:22:42] <robertmaxrees> you can declare variables inside if statements, but it's not doing what you think it is.
[13:23:52] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/881iiwk/#url=8uhdfh5
[13:24:03] <robertmaxrees> this is what your code winds up looking like after the browser does it's magic before it runs.
[13:35:44] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: Ahh, https://bpaste.net/show/826f9c663014 I just noticed you link --- this is my working alternative as well
[13:36:12] <strayArch> I still didn't move span though
[13:36:39] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[13:37:11] <strayArch> none that I see
[13:37:20] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: http://stronz.co/#portfolio
[13:37:36] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[13:37:40] <robertmaxrees> why can't i hit f12 there?
[13:37:56] <strayArch> hehe, i'm evil
[13:38:00] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[13:38:38] <robertmaxrees> that's a great way to piss off end users and have them leave your site.
[13:38:56] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: I want to make my code portfolio extensive and I was fooling around ways to prevent steeling --- true true.
[13:39:02] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[13:39:08] <robertmaxrees> seriously - there's no way to prevent stealing.
[13:39:31] <strayArch> I would have to use a tmp password and have access prevented without it
[13:39:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:39:59] <strayArch> As in use an access code, or extensive link like google docs
[13:40:06] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:40:27] <robertmaxrees> anybody who would care to steal anything there can very easily do it.
[13:41:44] <strayArch> True, it was more for entertaining the thought
[13:41:58] <robertmaxrees> like, i just coped the page source.
[13:42:10] <strayArch> Ik I could you js obfuscation
[13:42:14] <strayArch> use*
[13:42:26] <robertmaxrees> and i can still deobfuscate :)
[13:42:58] <strayArch> Haha, true. It's more of a fun cat and mouse game for me. It is also pointless work to have me learn things
[13:43:49] <strayArch> I could of very well just linked github to linkedin as well. But, It's more fun to design my own website
[13:44:23] <robertmaxrees> which is fine, but preventing me from doing anything with my keyboard is kind of intrusive.  you killed my ability to even switch/close tabs.
[13:44:48] <strayArch> robertmaxrees: I'll admit --- that is an unintended consequence xD
[13:49:59] <strayArch> i removed that obtrusive bit ^_^ I'll probably have a password protected bit for my entire developing code library
[13:50:12] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[13:51:13] <strayArch> should I just open source everything?
[13:51:29] <robertmaxrees> that's not what open source technically means.
[13:51:30] <strayArch> It feels weird to do so, but I know there is no reason I shouldnt
[13:51:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about why you're so protective over your code.
[13:52:39] <strayArch> I'm not either
[13:53:33] <strayArch> It feels weird to put a lot of work into something and just "giving it away"
[13:54:00] <NoiseEee> strayArch: nobody's taking it, don't worry
[13:54:28] <NoiseEee> presumably your JS requires a certain document markup, and a bunch of server-side stuff as well
[13:54:56] <NoiseEee> but i mean, people work hard on images, then put them on the web, and tough noogies.  the web is the web :)
[13:56:11] <Valduare> why is this opening to the wrong tab http://jsfiddle.net/5WrtE/19/
[13:56:38] <strayArch> True. Eh, my js wasn't what my protection was over. It was more over my senior capstone project (C++), which in the end, is intended to be used for a python library. It is just like a child --- its a lot of blood sweat and tears put into it ^_^
[13:56:54] <robertmaxrees> nah don't worry about it.
[13:57:33] <robertmaxrees> Valduare because :eq() is 0-based index, not 1.
[14:00:08] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: im very new to this - what does that mean?
[14:00:22] <Valduare> i’ve been trying to pull together snippets from here and there to get this working
[14:00:43] <robertmaxrees> Valduare are you familiar with arrays in javascript.
[14:00:49] <Valduare> no
[14:00:55] <robertmaxrees> ah, that's why.
[14:01:22] <robertmaxrees> so let's say you have var myArray = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'] - to access the first item in that array, you do myArray[0];
[14:01:30] <robertmaxrees> myArray[1] will give you bar.
[14:01:49] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:07:55] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/a8f0xg5k/ <--- is the jquery here valid?
[14:09:11] <mbrzuzy> you don't need to wrap it in the second jQuery(function ($), and .live is deprecated in newer jQuery versions
[14:10:00] <Tagor> Is there a way to run a function inside document.ready (jquery) from javascript?
[14:10:15] <robertmaxrees> Tagor bwuh?
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[14:11:11] <Kartagis> mbrzuzy: I have to use .live
[14:11:18] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis you need .on() instead.
[14:11:21] <robertmaxrees> .live9) has been deprecated.
[14:11:26] <robertmaxrees> *.live()
[14:11:57] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: I have to use .live because Drupal devs won't update the jq version
[14:12:02] <robertmaxrees> WAT
[14:12:03] <robertmaxrees> D:
[14:12:06] <robertmaxrees> kick them.
[14:12:11] <robertmaxrees> they hate new AND old browsers.
[14:12:12] <Tagor> robertmaxrees: because I want to output a <script></script> in my HTML
[14:12:21] <robertmaxrees> Tagor that doesn't make any sense
[14:12:32] <robertmaxrees> Tagor just put your logic in the doc ready instead.
[14:12:48] <Tagor> robertmaxrees: in this case I can't, long story
[14:12:50] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: so how do I modify the code in my fiddle to fix it? im not clear how I got what I have somewhat functional lol
[14:12:59] <mbrzuzy> Kartagis ouch :(
[14:13:14] <robertmaxrees> Tagor your question doesn't make any real sense then.
[14:13:19] <robertmaxrees> can you clarify what you're trying to do?

[14:31:29] <robertmaxrees> you'll learn.
[14:31:41] <robertmaxrees> basically, :eq() is 0-based.
[14:33:41] <Kartagis> this thing is driving me mad
[14:34:16] <Kartagis> anyway, I'm off
[14:55:20] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: got another question for ya :P
[14:55:26] <robertmaxrees> sure
[14:55:36] <robertmaxrees> just ask it to the room ;)
[14:56:11] <Valduare> I got a shoping cart icon and I am using ajax to update a number on it to signify how many items are in the cart
[14:56:16] <Valduare> BUT I can center the text for single digit numbers
[14:56:16] <Valduare> but what if the user buys more than 9 items then the spacing is off when it goes to double digit
[14:57:03] <robertmaxrees> how are you centering the text?
[14:57:04] <Valduare> wondering if theres simple way to detect and then adjust the css
[14:57:04] <Valduare> its a number centerd over a glyphicon atm
[14:57:04] <robertmaxrees> text-align: center;
[14:57:04] <Valduare> so using some top and left - properties to move the number over the glyphicon
[14:57:04] <robertmaxrees> where the container is however wide it needs to be to accommodate the space it'll take up.
[14:57:05] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[14:57:10] <robertmaxrees> for left, at least.
[14:57:24] <robertmaxrees> top is fine, but the left property shouldn't be touched there.
[14:57:59] <Valduare> it was only way I could figure - but it cancels out using things like text-align center the way I did it
[14:58:18] <robertmaxrees> share your code, then.
[14:58:38] <Valduare> let me see if I can tear it out and make a jsfiddle of it heh
[15:06:34] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: ok http://jsfiddle.net/7qbkgo95/1/
[15:07:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7qbkgo95/2/
[15:07:23] <Valduare> so for some reason
[15:07:23] <robertmaxrees> done.
[15:07:36] <Valduare> I added text-align: center in my jsfiddle and its working it seems...
[15:07:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:07:51] <robertmaxrees> that means you have a cascading style elsehwere causing headaches.
[15:08:29] <Valduare> hmm
[15:08:43] <robertmaxrees> have the site available live for us to look at?
[15:08:48] <robertmaxrees> also - you might have more luck in #css
[15:08:50] <Valduare> i could throw !important on all the css for that and see if it helps lol
[15:08:54] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[15:09:01] <Valduare> no its just on my laptop atm
[15:12:32] <Valduare> not seeing anything in firebug overriding my css ..
[15:12:47] <robertmaxrees> dunno mang.
[15:12:49] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it.
[15:16:11] <Valduare> ok i figured it out
[15:16:39] <Valduare> there was some styling on the elements used in the ajax number   that obviously wasnt showing up when you just hardcode the number in there for hte js fiddle heh
[15:16:50] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:19:19] <jfive> hello all
[15:19:35] <robertmaxrees> yo
[15:19:52] <jfive> question, i have <div class="video-player"> elements, but when i do this: console.log('clicked a tab', $('.video-player').length );
[15:19:56] <jfive> it returns "0"
[15:20:09] <jfive> question being, how could i debug this issue?
[15:20:29] <robertmaxrees> is that code before or after the elements on the page?
[15:20:57] <jfive> it's in a /js/main.js file which is called from the footer (bottom of the page), so after
[15:22:34] <robertmaxrees> and that container isn't dynaimcally created?
[15:22:43] <Omar-> nighty everyone
[15:23:03] <jfive> well, it is but it's created from php so it's already in the markup/html by the time jquery comes into play
[15:23:16] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it then it's hard to know.
[15:23:45] <jfive> the <div class="video-player"> exists in bootstrap tabs, if that matters... (but it shouldn't really)
[15:23:51] <jfive> yeah np, thanks anyhow
[15:23:56] <robertmaxrees> hrmm..
[15:26:23] <jfive> what's a good pastebin these days
[15:26:45] <jfive> oh nm i'l just use jsfiddle
[15:30:00] <robertmaxrees> or fixee.org
[15:30:09] <jfive> ok, thanks
[15:30:18] <jfive> and _great_ in jsfiddle it works :(
[15:30:42] <jfive> http://jsfiddle.net/b15wvaub/
[15:32:39] <jfive> arggh
[15:36:01] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: haha got it fixed - guys in #css clued me into    css initial value
[15:36:12] * Valduare used that to override all the css on the element so I could apply my own
[15:36:26] <Valduare> cart notification working now as planed :)
[15:36:57] <Valduare> ready for another question? :P
[15:37:09] <Valduare> this one is jquery based im sure :P
[15:38:41] <Valduare> this cart icon (glyphicon )     when i add a product to shoping cart i’d like to have some sort of animation / css style effect to draw more attention than just the number updating on it..   how can I tap into this other scripts ajax and run my own in addition to it
[15:51:15] <jfive> ahhhh i found it, jwplayer was renaming the class names on me
[15:59:35] <robertmaxrees> Valduare global ajax events are available
[15:59:43] <robertmaxrees> but updating the number is sufficient.
[16:00:46] <Valduare> no jiggles
[16:00:52] <Valduare> or gradiant swirls
[16:00:54] <Valduare> :P
[16:01:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:01:20] <Valduare> or a forced “you’ve added stuff to your cart” wav file
[16:01:32] <robertmaxrees> D:
[16:01:34] <Valduare> lol
[16:01:54] <Valduare> ok i’ll stick with the number then
[16:02:00] <robertmaxrees> that's what we do.
[16:02:10] <Valduare> the wav file? :P
[16:02:13] <Valduare> lol
[16:02:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:02:30] <robertmaxrees> nah just the number.
[16:02:58] <Valduare> how much traffic are you guys getting
[16:03:21] <robertmaxrees> let me check.
[16:03:22] <robertmaxrees> it's a lot.
[16:06:46] <robertmaxrees> actually i don't think i can give you the exact number hahaha
[16:08:33] <Valduare> lol
[16:09:38] <robertmaxrees> it's a lot, thouygh.
[16:09:58] <Valduare> what kind of products
[16:10:01] <robertmaxrees> build.com
[16:10:05] <robertmaxrees> home improvement.
[16:10:13] <robertmaxrees> we compete with lowe's and home depot.
[16:12:24] <jim_j> hi
[16:12:42] <Valduare> interesting
[16:12:51] <robertmaxrees> we have a bunch of sites other than that one.
[16:13:09] <Valduare> where’s the company based out of
[16:13:11] <jim_j> I'm using scrollTop to scrill to a div id, but how do I make sure I scroll to the left most of the page?
[16:13:16] <jim_j> to scroll
[16:13:17] <robertmaxrees> Chico, CA, Valduare
[16:13:37] <robertmaxrees> jim_j http://api.jquery.com/scrollleft/
[16:14:32] <jim_j> robert, so I call scrollTop followed by scrollLeft?
[16:14:44] <robertmaxrees> jim_j sure?  why not?
[16:15:01] <jim_j> robert, ok, not sure if there was a compact way, thanks
[16:15:23] <robertmaxrees> jim_j you shouldn't need to worry about the horizontal scroll.
[16:16:07] <jim_j> robert, well in a mobile device, the user could be scroll to the right so I want to make sure I reset them back to the left of the div
[16:16:18] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[16:24:11] <aspiers> how do I get the equivalent of outerHTML on a document fragment? tried 100 things - am I missing something obvious?
[16:24:18] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to.
[16:24:26] <robertmaxrees> the fragment returns the outerHTML
[16:25:17] <aspiers> nope, d3-tip renders '[object DocumentFragment]'
[16:25:31] <aspiers> d3-tip needs the anonymous function to return a string
[16:25:31] <robertmaxrees> something about your question isn't making sense.
[16:25:44] <aspiers> I'm dynamically composing tooltips
[16:25:50] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ aspiers
[16:25:50] <b-ot> aspiers: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:25:54] <aspiers> starting with a document fragment as the template
[16:26:30] <robertmaxrees> http://davidwalsh.name/documentfragment
[16:26:52] <aspiers> robertmaxrees: I already read that
[16:27:13] <robertmaxrees> okay - then what isn't clicking? you can't append the parent fragment, only its children.
[16:27:29] <aspiers> append is no use in this context, because of what I said about d3-tip
[16:27:31] <robertmaxrees> but that means you can create a <ul> as the first child and go from there.
[16:27:32] <aspiers> it needs a string
[16:27:46] <aspiers> https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip/blob/master/docs/updating-tooltip-content.md#tiphtml
[16:28:00] <aspiers> the callback has to return a string
[16:28:18] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up here.
[16:28:21] <aspiers> my template is a fragment, so after I've populated it, I need to convert to a string
[16:28:32] <robertmaxrees> you can't convert the entire fragment to a string.
[16:28:34] <robertmaxrees> only its contents.
[16:29:36] <aspiers> what's the difference?
[16:29:58] <aspiers> even getting the contents as a string would be good enough
[16:30:33] <aspiers> how would I do that?
[16:31:08] <aspiers> innerHTML returns undefined
[16:31:11] <robertmaxrees> using raw JS or what?.
[16:31:21] <aspiers> yeah, I'm trying it in the Chrome console
[16:32:49] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:33:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dcsevxmq/
[16:36:05] <robertmaxrees> aspiers ^
[16:40:00] <aspiers> robertmaxrees: so I have to loop over all children and concatenate?
[16:40:27] <robertmaxrees> or give them a single parent, yeah.
[16:42:32] <aspiers> ok
[16:43:05] <aspiers> that did the trick. thanks!!
[16:44:02] <robertmaxrees> awesome - see the issue?
[16:46:35] <aspiers> yes, it seems to be an ugly corner case
[16:47:01] <aspiers> I wonder why document fragments can't follow the same API as normal elements?
[16:47:11] <robertmaxrees> because they're fragments :)
[16:47:22] <aspiers> well OK, let me rephrase that
[16:47:34] <aspiers> I wonder why document fragments don't support an outerHTML method
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> because the fragment itself isn't an element.
[16:48:11] <aspiers> I said "an" outerHTML method, not *the* outerHTML method
[16:48:23] <aspiers> i.e. same name, but different code, rendering the same results
[16:48:32] <robertmaxrees> because that would be very confusing and inconsistent.
[16:48:34] <aspiers> same, as in, DWIM
[16:48:41] <aspiers> why?
[16:48:55] <aspiers> OK, call it something different then
[16:49:03] <aspiers> my point is, it should be part of the API
[16:49:12] <aspiers> rather than having to jump through hoops
[16:49:12] <robertmaxrees> eh, i still disagree, but OK
[16:49:24] <aspiers> it's like the difference between Perl and Ruby
[16:49:38] <aspiers> Ruby has all the common methods you would need
[16:49:45] <aspiers> with Perl you have to reinvent them each time
[16:50:13] <robertmaxrees> the DOM APIs can be a little weird, but I've never really had any issues with document fragments.
[16:50:28] <robertmaxrees> you're using them in a strange way so that factors in,
[16:50:33] <aspiers> that's kind of my point :) it's fine once you know how
[16:50:36] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:50:47] <aspiers> but knowing how is a massive PITA sometimes
[16:51:03] <aspiers> I trawled google and StackOverflow for about an hour before giving up and asking here
[16:51:21] <aspiers> I'm no JS expert but I'm hardly a newbie coder
[16:51:40] <aspiers> ah well, enough bitching - I'm just tired and a bit burnt out right now
[16:51:44] <aspiers> too many late nights
[17:06:15] <robertmaxrees> back
[17:07:44] <Unopoo> I need to create several large dom, and each of them with a increment id number, what's the best way to do this?
[17:07:44] <Unopoo> I think about store the dom string to a variable and pass it to $() when needed, but that way the id number won't increment
[17:13:59] <robertmaxrees> use templating maybe?
[17:14:07] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Unopoo
[17:14:07] <b-ot> Unopoo: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:22:42] <Unopoo> robertmaxrees: wait a minute
[17:24:10] <decx> might as well wait 10
[17:24:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:24:39] <Unopoo> robertmaxrees: I'm now doing it like this:http://jsfiddle.net/HickHack/j3cLrckn/
[17:24:50] <robertmaxrees> woah
[17:25:27] <decx> you cant concat a string like that in js
[17:25:43] <robertmaxrees> also - that's complex enough that i'd really suggest going with a templating engine instead.
[17:25:54] <Unopoo> decx: no wonder I got an error
[17:28:45] <Unopoo> robertmaxrees: I'll look up about jquery templating
[17:28:52] <Unopoo> thx for the hint
[17:28:55] <robertmaxrees> Unopoo there's really no such thing.
[17:29:12] <decx> i'm liooking over it
[17:29:31] <decx> even with templating there isnt that much repetition
[17:29:56] <robertmaxrees> that's a helluva string to build out on your own though.
[17:30:00] <decx> couple of inputs, couple of selects, and then a group of inputs
[17:30:03] <robertmaxrees> unless you want to juggle objects like a boss.
[17:30:41] <robertmaxrees> and i suggested templating of some kind because the implication is that this whole thing will get repeated at least a few times.
[17:30:54] <decx> might as well let your server send out the html instead
[17:31:04] <robertmaxrees> ^ or this.
[17:34:32] <Unopoo> decx: if I　fetch it form server, how the formIndex be increment? its value depends on how many alike form existing
[17:34:40] <Unopoo> *from*
[17:34:50] <robertmaxrees> hold state somewhere and increment as necessary.
[17:35:01] <robertmaxrees> though i'd question the original idea - what is that ID even for?
[17:35:50] <Unopoo> robertmaxrees: not a id, I said it's a id at first just for stating my problem
[17:36:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd still argue that you're archiecting things the hard way, but (shrug)
[17:36:43] <Unopoo> robertmaxrees: what's your advise, plz?
[17:37:13] <robertmaxrees> what kind of tool are you building?
[17:39:12] <Unopoo> it's just several forms, and I want when the user click 'addNew' or something, a new form is generated and append to the last existing form
[17:39:47] <robertmaxrees> i'd do that all in your backend.
[17:39:59] <robertmaxrees> manage that state there, etc.
[17:40:48] <Unopoo> robertmaxrees: I actually don't see the advantage of backend solution
[17:40:51] <Unopoo> tell me
[17:41:11] <Unopoo> I'd need ajax
[17:41:32] <Unopoo> I'd need to manage state
[17:41:42] <robertmaxrees> it'll be better at managing state and building swaths of markup.  if you really can't avoid that, do some kind of templating.  if you really can't do that, do what you're shooting for here i guess.
[17:42:24] <decx> you already use phpfor the discountpercentage
[17:47:10] <Unopoo> robertmaxrees: I think I'll use `some kind of templating`
[17:47:25] <Unopoo> thx guys
[17:48:06] <StanAccy> Can I add a selector that will fire a function on all currently matched elements and all dynamically added ones in future? (sort of like the old live() method, but without a event handler)
[17:48:16] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:48:25] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:49:31] <StanAccy> So lets say I have a page with 20 divs, all with the same class foo.  I run $('.foo').someFunc();  it does stuff to those divs great. Now I add a bunch more of those divs.  Whats the best way to have the someFunc(); method run on those newly added divs?
[17:49:57] <StanAccy> just re-rin the selector on the whole page?
[17:50:50] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: If you can run someFunc on them again without any issue just go for it, if not you can set a flag on the element.
[17:51:04] <StanAccy> I have this problem on a whole series of styling scripts so Im looking for a good/generic solution
[17:52:47] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: http://gnarf.net/widget-factory/#1 might be of interest to you.
[17:54:02] <StanAccy> BillCriswell: not sure I follow
[17:54:22] <StanAccy> thats how to write a func, I understand that. was there somethign specific in that link that I should take extra notice of?
[17:56:19] <acidjazz> if ii have like
[17:56:25] <acidjazz> $('.team') and there are 5 team divs
[17:56:28] <acidjazz> how do i select the 3nd
[17:56:29] <acidjazz> 2nd
[17:56:36] <acidjazz> $('.team:nth-child(2)') ?
[17:56:37] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: .eq(2)
[17:56:44] <acidjazz> graci
[17:56:52] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: What the widget factory does is like... sets some data on the element and if it exists it doesn't run again.
[17:57:33] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: i assume this starts from 0
[17:57:38] <acidjazz> since its selecting the 3rd
[17:57:38] <Unopoo> why the `Unexpected token ILLEGAL` error? at line 2 of my code?
[17:57:38] <acidjazz> for 2
[17:57:38] <Unopoo> I remember I always get this error when using $.ajax(), because wrong datatype specified, but this time I really can't figure it out why, the error give too little info
[17:57:45] <Unopoo> http://jsfiddle.net/HickHack/j3cLrckn/
[17:57:50] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: I always forget till I try it and see.
[17:57:51] <StanAccy> BillCriswell: I only see one slide with code on it - assuming thats all ther is, how is it doing that?
[17:58:12] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Yeah, it's 0 based.
[17:58:14] <StanAccy> BillCriswell: I only see a this.addClass() invocation
[17:58:24] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: doesnt nth-child start w/ 1 ?
[17:58:31] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Yes.
[17:58:33] <acidjazz> i think first-child is 1
[17:58:37] <acidjazz> whats eq even stand for
[17:58:42] <BillCriswell> equal
[17:58:47] <acidjazz> odd
[17:58:49] <acidjazz> works though
[17:59:14] <decx> wrong fiddle Unopoo?
[17:59:18] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: http://gnarf.net/widget-factory/#5 this slide would be how to keep it from running on other elements.
[17:59:29] <BillCriswell> running on elements it has already run on*
[17:59:32] <decx> that's still the monster string
[17:59:38] <StanAccy> BillCriswell: Ah, thats a different page! :-) Thanks
[17:59:55] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: Wait I lied, that doesn't actually check it.
[18:00:05] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: but use the arrow keys to navigate through that slide.
[18:00:08] <Unopoo> decx: oh, I originally think I know what you mean by `can't cat string like that`
[18:00:11] <Unopoo> but I don't
[18:00:21] <decx> give me a sec
[18:00:23] <Unopoo> so I changed it few time and got no good
[18:00:33] <decx> give you a heads up on the template
[18:00:42] <StanAccy> BillCriswell: Ah, that explains a lot - I was just using the mouse to scroll
[18:00:48] <StanAccy> BillCriswell: thanks
[18:00:55] <BillCriswell> no problem.
[18:06:58] <decx> Unopoo: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/j3cLrckn/1/
[18:07:50] <decx> just a quick example with handlebars to make me sleepy enough ^^
[18:15:26] <Unopoo> decx: neat, but I never heard about handlebars..
[18:15:26] <Unopoo> some jquery plugin?
[18:15:40] <Unopoo> ok , searched it
[18:16:23] <Unopoo> decx: but for now, can you tell me why the error? and how can I fix it? I can't sleep without know it
[18:17:40] <decx> here's a way to concat multiple lines http://jsfiddle.net/decx/ykud1utj/
[18:18:19] <decx> there are others but it's all a big mess with a complex structure like your form
[18:19:00] <Unopoo> decx: I'll learn to use a templating thing
[18:27:18] <jeffreylevesque> what's the best way to check if a value is an integer?
[19:04:42] <Unopoo> if I define a function like this: function funName(){} in $(document).ready(function(){});
[19:04:42] <Unopoo> then if I run the funName() in chrome console, it said not defined;
[19:04:42] <Unopoo> if I change the function definition to funName=function(){}
[19:04:42] <Unopoo> then the problem disappear
[19:04:42] <Unopoo> why is that?
[20:18:45] <JavaLover> is there a way to in Chromes console window, view the history of your browser...to see what is happening with history.pushState?
[20:20:30] <vamega1> Hi, I'm looking for at http://api.jquery.com/index/
[20:20:56] <vamega1> And trying to see if there is a way to get the indices for all the elements of the collection rather than just the first one.
[20:54:18] <AcidRain2012> i need some help on making a set of data look pretty
[20:54:28] <AcidRain2012> i dont know what the best way to go about organizing this is, UI wise
[20:54:29] <AcidRain2012> http://pastebin.com/YBLSah5u
[20:56:03] <JBlitzen> Acid
[20:56:16] <AcidRain2012> yo
[20:56:16] <JBlitzen> That's a bit confusing to me
[20:56:22] <AcidRain2012> yea me to :/
[20:56:26] <JBlitzen> What are "Units"?
[20:56:36] <AcidRain2012> units is any # of a unit type.
[20:56:41] <AcidRain2012> like.. shirts, pants
[20:56:42] <AcidRain2012> anything
[20:56:52] <JBlitzen> I don't understand why someone would take out a loan for pants
[20:56:56] <JBlitzen> But is that what you mean?
[20:57:05] <JBlitzen> Or does units have some other relationship to the loan
[20:57:28] <AcidRain2012> lol. im making an inventory management system. and perhaps loan is the wrong word
[20:57:40] <AcidRain2012> consignment perhaps is the right word
[20:57:46] <catcher2> Need a hand with datatables, hoping someone can help. I'm passing server-side data from an ajax source. The data has knowledge about css classes that need to be present, varying per cell. How can I include this in the json response?
[20:57:53] <JBlitzen> Oh
[20:58:01] <JBlitzen> So it's like, um, layaway?
[20:58:08] <AcidRain2012> right!
[20:58:12] <JBlitzen> Ah, gotcha
[20:58:13] <AcidRain2012> i like that word
[20:58:27] <AcidRain2012> u know of a good idea on how to show this UI ?
[20:58:35] <JBlitzen> Well
[20:58:53] <JBlitzen> Yes, but let me get my head around it for a minute
[20:59:07] <JBlitzen> What I'd want to see in any such list is this
[20:59:08] <AcidRain2012> ok, perhaps i can repost and try to make it more simple?
[20:59:10] <JBlitzen> No
[20:59:26] <AcidRain2012> it doesnt rly have to be of a list type
[20:59:28] <JBlitzen> I want to see what the layaway is for, and who it's for, in the top left
[20:59:32] <AcidRain2012> i currently have it in a table. and its looking ugly
[20:59:33] <JBlitzen> Or at least on the top somewhere
[20:59:36] <JBlitzen> Be quiet
[20:59:40] <JBlitzen> I want to see what the layaway is for, and who it's for, in the top left
[20:59:41] <AcidRain2012> k lol
[20:59:46] <JBlitzen> Or at least on the top somewhere
[20:59:54] <JBlitzen> Next, I want to see the payments that have been made
[20:59:58] <JBlitzen> Broken down into rows
[21:00:11] <JBlitzen> And at the bottom, FOR THAT ITEM and THAT PERSON,
[21:00:19] <JBlitzen> I want to see the total payments made, and the remaining balance
[21:00:28] * AcidRain2012 nods
[21:00:33] <JBlitzen> Which also suggests I want to see the original balance on the top row as well
[21:00:48] <JBlitzen> That's how an invoice or whatever would look, and it would work fine in a table with multiples as well
[21:00:55] <JBlitzen> Let me adjust your pastebin quick to match that
[21:01:02] <AcidRain2012> im liking it!
[21:01:31] <AcidRain2012> brb, bathroom, thx for  your insight and creativity
[21:02:40] <AcidRain2012> bak

[21:04:28] <JBlitzen> Check that out, Acid ^
[21:04:57] <JBlitzen> The raw has better tab spacing, but I think you get the point either way
[21:05:39] <AcidRain2012> hmmm
[21:05:51] <AcidRain2012> for example, what is the 100 under the 400?
[21:07:05] <JBlitzen> Formatted a little better, that was a bit fucky:

[21:07:53] <AcidRain2012> yea thats better :)
[21:07:54] <AcidRain2012> thanks
[21:09:09] <JBlitzen> Sure
[21:39:26] <gtristan> Hi, I'm trying to understand how this jquery plugin works: https://github.com/voidberg/html5sortable/blob/master/src/html.sortable.js
[21:39:42] <gtristan> Specifically, it connects to events which afaics don't exist
[21:40:01] <gtristan> like $().on ('dragstart.h5s')
[21:40:20] <gtristan> nobody is triggering the event 'dragstart.h5s'
[21:41:06] <gtristan> there exists the drag and drop events dragstart, dragend, dragover etc, but those events are not ".h5s"
[21:42:19] <gtristan> in the jquery documentation for .on(), what I understand is that events can be namespaced, like if I create a plugin, I might want to name an event that I trigger 'foo.myPlugin'
[21:43:01] <gtristan> but in the case of this plugin in particular, it seems not the case... it is just connecting to events which are not triggered by anything :-/
[21:43:36] <gtristan> anyway, I'm almost certain I have misunderstood it, and there is some kind of magick meaning to a '.' in an event name given to .on()
[21:45:02] <gtristan> ah, I think I got it sorry for noise
[21:45:15] <gtristan> seems to be described in the "Event names and namespaces" section of the .on() docs
