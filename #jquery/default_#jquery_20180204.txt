[05:39:01] <mrec> hi, is it possible to encode a space with %20 instead + when doing a jquery post?
[05:39:19] <mrec> if I pre-encode it with %20 it ends up with %2520 (also escaping the %)
[06:35:44] <Woet> mrec: why does it matter how it's encoded?
[06:36:40] <mrec> doesn't matter anymore I was just expecting %20 instead of +
[09:30:13] <bravvve22> hi ,jstl is not working on jsp file  https://pastebin.com/4csGWWF5 when to load like this https://pastebin.com/zMm4HLpq
[09:40:15] <Woet> bravvve22: what is your jQuery question?
[10:26:15] <bravvve22> Woet:is there any issue affection jstl wen using load() function?
[10:26:26] <bravvve22> Woet:is there any issue affecting jstl wen using load() function?
[10:28:39] <Woet> bravvve22: i don't know, i stick to modern stacks.
[10:29:05] <a_djangooo>  I am getting this while using AJAX (Failed to load https://www.example.com No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access.) error but when I check example.com the request seems to have worked. Does this mean there is something wrong with the example.com API?
[10:29:26] <bravvve22> Woet:jstl is old?
[10:29:49] <Woet> a_djangooo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing
[10:30:16] <Woet> bravvve22: i don't know many new people or startups picking up JSP.
[10:30:56] <a_djangooo> Woet, When I included jsonp in my request, I got an invalid request error from the API. when I don't use jsonp, i get the error but the request gets processed by the site.
[10:31:31] <Woet> a_djangooo: I'm missing a question
[10:32:03] <a_djangooo> Woet, does that mean there is something wrong with the API?
[10:32:29] <Woet> a_djangooo: the wiki page I linked explains the error.
[10:33:20] <Woet> a_djangooo: whether that means theres something wrong with the API or your code is up to you to determine
[10:33:37] <Woet> a_djangooo: i'm not familiar with the API of "example.com"
[10:33:48] <a_djangooo> Woet, that was just meant to be an example
[10:33:59] <Woet> a_djangooo: yea, I don't know why you mask something as public as domains either.
[11:08:26] <lintguy> How do i build an event chain with jQuery?
[11:09:14] <lintguy> For example, Dropdown changes -> Ajax request -> Handle response -> Trigger another dropdown.
[11:21:21] <Buoy172> Is there any carousel that allows vertically scrollable content?
[11:24:25] <Buoy172> How can I create a multitabbed page where each page is scrollable when brought into view?
[16:58:30] <RabSimpson> Hi folks, I'm struggling with a buggy class toggle. I began trying .toggleClass but it was very erratic so I'm now using .hasClass with .addClass and .removeClass, but it's still being a bit weird. Here's my JS and page: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/89a0f79dd8d5cf603194173a8939f601 https://hillhay.darwincm.net/?bypass_=1 Any ideas?
[16:58:53] <RabSimpson> The specific function is navToggleItemClasses()
[17:35:22] <devi8> RabSimpson, where are you having problems?
[17:36:23] <RabSimpson> devi8: I've partially reworked it to the point where the only issue is the 'triggered' class not being removed when the navigation div fades out
[17:36:47] <RabSimpson> devi8: It seems that .removeClass doesn't work on elements with display: hidden;
[17:37:50] <devi8> RabSimpson, here are some suggestions. Handle the entire thing from the nav element, not the individual buttons
[17:39:01] <devi8> I'll show you...gimme just a second
[17:39:12] <RabSimpson> devi8: There's an animation on each list item when it shows, so I just need to get rid of the triggered class
[17:41:41] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/v8g9qfzx/
[17:42:27] <devi8> This tells the parent of the buttons (the nav element) to listen for click events   When it receives a click event, it figures out whch button was clicked
[17:42:44] <RabSimpson> devi8: Your fiddle doesn't include the nav element
[17:43:07] <devi8> My fiddle was an example of how to write the script. You have to apply it yourself
[17:43:23] <devi8> Rather than handling the event on each button, do it on the parent element
[17:43:30] <devi8> that way you only have to do it once
[17:43:54] <devi8> let the single event handler perform the addition and removal of the classes
[17:44:48] <RabSimpson> devi8: That was fine when I wanted the whole thing to animate all at once, and everything is handled off a single click (or hitting escape) already
[17:45:07] <RabSimpson> devi8: The classes aren't being removed
[17:45:11] <devi8> that works on any number of clicks
[17:45:55] <devi8> and besides, you should really use the transition property in css to handle your animations--it's faster and smoother
[17:46:14] <RabSimpson> devi8: I've updated my gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/555d52fe5813e96ddbdcc75e02bd2974
[17:46:16] <devi8> So just adding the class will animate any element. Then removing the clas hides it
[17:46:34] <devi8> RabSimpson, put your code on jsfiddle
[17:46:39] <devi8> then we have a working example.
[17:47:00] <RabSimpson> devi8: This is the live version: https://hillhay.darwincm.net/?bypass_=1
[17:47:05] <devi8> Copy the html into the html pane, the css into the css pane and the js into the javascript pane.
[17:47:24] <devi8> I can't edit that, obviously. A working example that I can edit will help you in real time
[17:47:47] <RabSimpson> Just a sec
[17:49:36] <RabSimpson> You'll need to change the view so the preview is wide, otherwise the trigger class won't make a difference: https://jsfiddle.net/aLngmnsc/
[17:52:56] <devi8> SO what is supposed to happen?
[17:53:29] <RabSimpson> Each of the list items fade in and move down 10px when the nav layer appears
[17:53:57] <RabSimpson> The triggered class remaining means they only do this the first time
[17:58:04] <devi8> So, to get to the nav menu, I click the menu icon and the navigation menu is displayed then I click a button and it disappears...
[17:58:39] <devi8> love your logo, btw. very nice
[18:03:30] <devi8> So you want your navigation bar to slidedown and move the content with it? I don't understand what you are trying to accomplish, but I'll show you some problems with your code and maybe that will help resolve it.
[18:25:39] <devi8> RabSimpson, you still around?
[18:43:57] <RabSimpson> devi8: I had to take a call. Everything is as needed except the navigation list items don't reset.
[18:44:11] <RabSimpson> devi8: Sorry to keep you waiting
[18:45:19] <devi8> what do you mean, don't reset?
[18:47:07] <RabSimpson> All I need is the 'triggered' class removed (when the nav element is closed) from the list items so they fade in and down one at a time when the nav element comes into view
[18:47:30] <devi8> in your navToggleItemClasess function, you only add the trigger class, if its not triggered, nothing happens
[18:47:35] <devi8> line 47
[18:47:48] <RabSimpson> As it is, they do this the first time the nav element is revealed, but each time afterwards they just fade in with the black layer
[18:48:32] <RabSimpson> It's supposed to be removed when fadeOutNavLayer() is called
[18:48:51] <devi8> what is line 49 doing?
[18:49:25] <RabSimpson> Looping through the list items with a delay of 300ms
[18:49:36] <devi8> it does it once
[18:49:41] <devi8> there's no loop there
[18:49:55] <RabSimpson> It's calling the function it's inside
[18:50:14] <devi8> right which has an if statement that says "if not triggered" do nothing
[18:50:33] <RabSimpson> If the class isn't triggered, add it
[18:50:38] <devi8> line 47 closes on line 50...there's nothing after that
[18:50:39] <RabSimpson> Line 47
[18:50:54] <devi8> where's the If it is triggered, remove it?
[18:51:11] <RabSimpson> Line 20
[18:51:50] <RabSimpson> The first thing fadeInNavLayer() is supposed to do is remove the triggered class from the list items
[18:52:21] <RabSimpson> Sorry, fadeOutNavLayer()
[18:53:01] <devi8> but you call navtoggleItemClasess() after setting triggered to on for the one navitem after a delay.
[18:53:26] <RabSimpson> With a specific index
[18:53:41] <devi8> what if it's the last element in the nav items list?
[18:53:42] <RabSimpson> Parameter 2
[18:54:02] <RabSimpson> The last element index is 1 less than the length
[18:54:13] <RabSimpson> if( ( typeof( navItems[i] ) !== 'undefined' ) && ( i < navItems.length ) ) {
[18:54:30] <devi8> do you want them all to slide up at once or one after the other
[18:55:26] <RabSimpson> Sliding up doesn't matter, they're all disappearing on fadeOutNavLayer(), I just need the triggered class removed so they slide down when fadeInNavLayer() is called
[19:09:34] <RabSimpson> Any ideas?
[19:09:47] <devi8> yeah. gimme a minute.
[19:12:14] <RabSimpson> No probs :)
[19:15:54] <devi8> try lines 10-37 https://jsfiddle.net/aLngmnsc/1/
[19:17:04] <devi8> Rather than calling fadeOutNavLayer and fadeInNavLayer, you can just call toggleNavLayer...it will know if the nav layer is showing or not. If it is, it will hide the box and fade in the nav, wait for 5 seconds then fade in the items
[19:17:31] <devi8> 35 should say box.fadeIn(); sorry
[19:25:56] <RabSimpson> devi8: I updated line 35 and the nav layer doesn't appear when clicking the hamburger
[19:30:10] <devi8> I forgot you aren't using css to animate opacitry. Here it is the way you do it, sorry. https://jsfiddle.net/aLngmnsc/4/
[19:32:05] <RabSimpson> devi8: The nav layer appears now, but the list items remain hidden
[19:33:58] <devi8> where do you animate the position of the buttons?
[19:36:14] <RabSimpson> CSS
[19:36:40] <RabSimpson> The only animation handled by JS is fading the nav layer itself in and out
[19:38:06] <devi8> Do you add triggered to the navItems or the nav menu
[19:38:30] <RabSimpson> The items
[19:38:38] <RabSimpson> So they animate separately
[19:38:56] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/aLngmnsc/5/
[19:39:22] <devi8> maybe it's not loading the css, but I don't see the nav menu items moving down.
[19:39:39] <RabSimpson> They're all coming in at once now
[19:40:52] <devi8> np. one sec
[19:49:09] <devi8> I don't see any of them moving
[19:49:51] <RabSimpson> There should be a 300ms delay between each list item appearing
[19:49:51] <devi8> can you look in your .triggered class to see what is moving them?
[19:50:14] <RabSimpson> The triggered class just moves them 10px and changes the opacity from 0 to 1
[19:50:54] <RabSimpson> Without triggered set, they're translated upwards 10px with an opacity of 0
[19:56:45] <devi8> I can watch them all add the triggered class, but nothing happens like that.
[19:58:08] <RabSimpson> I can see the class being added, but it never removes it
[20:02:48] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/aLngmnsc/8/
[20:03:09] <devi8> You can watch the console log and see that they are adding triggered one after the other...
[20:03:21] <devi8> but something else is messing with your css
[20:05:03] <RabSimpson> It looks like it's behaving as expected now :)
[20:05:17] <RabSimpson> Now I need to work out what you've done :P
[20:06:32] <RabSimpson> I appreciate you taking the time to dig into this :)
[20:06:35] <devi8> here are some comments: cache your jquery objects...instead of $(navitems) every time, do that once: var navitemselector="something" var navitems=$(navitemselector)
