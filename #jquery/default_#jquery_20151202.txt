[01:09:53] <Cork> peteretep: you shouldn't have to do anything just giving that object to ajax should be enough
[01:10:10] <Cork> ajax({ data: yourObject })
[01:11:07] <monstercat> anyone want to buy my server?
[01:11:24] <monstercat> access to my server i should say

[01:17:23] <Uhkis> monstercat: do you keep adding hdd's to it all the time or how is that unlimited storage implemented? :-D
[01:17:47] <monstercat> no idea, a guy gave it to me one day :l

[01:26:18] <Uhkis> Woet: but, but, unlimited??
[01:26:25] <Woet> nope
[01:26:40] <Woet> i wanted to login and prove it to him
[01:26:45] <Woet> but as it turns out it doesn't even belong to him
[01:26:46] <Woet> zz
[01:27:21] <Uhkis> dirty false advertising
[01:42:58] <Cork> Uhkis: and this isn't the only channel...
[01:43:13] <Cork> he's been in two other channels i'm in already
[01:46:32] <Kartagis> I've been banging my head against this endpoint not found issue
[01:46:49] <Kartagis> turns out, it was access origin
[02:44:21] <hellyeah> hey
[02:44:30] <hellyeah> why i cannot drag button http://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/6/
[02:44:52] <Mark__> you probably did something wrong.
[02:45:08] <Uhkis> very helpful Mark__
[02:45:11] <hellyeah> i checked the jquery tutorial
[02:45:13] <Mark__> sorrylol
[02:45:48] <hellyeah> i tried that with click event, mousedown event but it is not working can you help?
[02:46:35] <hellyeah> i added tef of jquer ui
[02:46:56] <Mark__> hmm
[02:47:07] <Mark__> perhaps it doesn’t let you drag a button? idk
[02:47:12] <Mark__> im trying right now.
[02:47:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[02:47:27] <hellyeah> thanks
[02:47:44] <hellyeah> this is the tutorial https://jqueryui.com/draggable/#default
[02:47:55] <Mark__> did you try adding some properties on css though?
[02:48:00] <Cork> hellyeah: you can't drag buttons
[02:48:10] <Cork> it is a limitation in the draggable widget
[02:48:18] <Mark__> i see.
[02:48:18] <hellyeah> humm
[02:48:20] <hellyeah> ic
[02:48:31] <hellyeah> so  i need to write my own drag script
[02:48:47] <Cork> or you could wrap them in an element and drag that instead
[02:48:47] <Mark__> why would you want to drag around the button/
[02:48:48] <Mark__> ?
[02:48:55] <Cork> like <span><button></button></span>
[02:48:55] <Mark__> instead you could make a div as a button
[02:48:58] <Mark__> that would be more easier.
[02:49:15] <Cork> Mark__: except it isn't markup sane to do so
[02:49:28] <hellyeah> let me try span thing
[02:50:11] <Mark__> i know this is not a css room but does anyof you know why 100vh doesn’t cover the whole screen resolution?
[02:50:19] <Cork> i helped someone with a similar problem about a year ago, that is the only reason i knew about this limitation
[02:50:37] <Cork> Mark__: uh, it doesn't?
[02:50:47] <Mark__> yeah, it leaves out some space in the bottom.
[02:50:54] <Mark__> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/index.php?mid=htmlcss&page=1
[02:51:01] <Cork> btw, damn i like the new jsfiddle
[02:51:02] <Mark__> if you click on the thumbnails.
[02:51:06] <Mark__> you do?
[02:51:12] <Mark__> me and pingu dont
[02:51:20] <Mark__> i mean i like it a littel bit.
[02:52:03] <Cork> Mark__: looks fairly 100% to me https://jsfiddle.net/3fkzdc3g/ :)
[02:52:25] <Mark__> hmm,
[02:52:30] <Cork> Mark__: note it is 100vh of the parents height
[02:52:33] <Cork> not available space
[02:52:38] <Mark__> right..
[02:53:26] <hellyeah> no luck http://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/7/
[02:53:47] <Mark__> how did this site manage to cover the whole screen then? https://www.behance.net/
[02:53:54] <Mark__> i don’t think its 100vh..
[02:54:09] <Cork> hellyeah: all the spans are nested
[02:54:15] <Cork> (you haven't closed any of them)
[02:54:27] <hellyeah> damn
[02:54:31] <hellyeah> sorry about that
[02:54:51] <Cork> Mark__: cover the hole screen?
[02:54:55] <Cork> you mean the blackout?
[02:55:02] <Mark__> yes.
[02:55:07] <Mark__> im trying the same thing.
[02:55:16] <Cork> the classic position: fixed;
[02:55:29] <Cork> top:0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;
[02:55:58] <hellyeah> i dont understand why it didnt work http://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/8/
[02:56:23] <hellyeah> may be make a div like a button is better idea what do you think?
[02:56:58] <Cork> hellyeah: hmm that is another problem
[02:56:59] <peteretep> Cork: No, you need to specify you want traditional parameter handling
[02:57:09] <Cork> cause those spans aren't initiated as draggables
[02:57:16] <hellyeah> haha
[02:57:18] <hellyeah> xD
[02:57:43] <hellyeah> Cork: so make a div like a button is the option?
[02:57:48] <Mark__> okay, i gave it position:absolute, top bottom left right 0px
[02:57:52] <Mark__> and still no luck
[02:57:59] <Mark__> sec.
[02:59:02] <hellyeah> let me try that
[02:59:37] <Cork> ah, he needed the [] in the params
[03:00:02] <Cork> actually... no
[03:00:07] <hellyeah> what
[03:00:14] <hellyeah> me?
[03:00:26] <Cork> no petereteps problem
[03:00:43] <Mark__> nope, it doesn’t work. im doomed almost everytime..
[03:00:48] <Cork> why he needed traditional for the params was unrelated to his question
[03:01:03] <Cork> and i'm a bit curious of why he actually needed it
[03:01:28] <Cork> hellyeah: the problem is that draggable isn't initializing at all
[03:02:12] <Cork> ah
[03:02:23] <Cork> hellyeah: your loading http:// from an https:// site
[03:02:31] <Cork> so jquery-ui isn't loading
[03:02:48] <hellyeah> hmm i didnt see warning about that
[03:02:57] <Mark__> it doesn’t seem to warn you
[03:03:01] <Cork> my console is full of it
[03:03:03] <Mark__> when you are missing jquerylibrary.
[03:03:06] <Mark__> okay..
[03:03:43] <Mark__> btw, 100vh doesnt work,so i have to manually cover it by using 200%
[03:03:47] <Mark__> this is ridiculous
[03:04:03] <hellyeah> when you do it http it worked?
[03:05:34] <Cork> there we go https://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/10/
[03:05:41] <Cork> hellyeah: also classs != class
[03:05:55] <Cork> so $('.spanClass').length == 0
[03:06:34] <Cork> Mark__: can you reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle?
[03:06:40] <Cork> 200% isn't needed
[03:06:52] <Mark__> hmm i don’t think so, cause the height of the contents is auto height
[03:06:57] <Mark__> and i need contents.
[03:07:01] <Mark__> but here is the live page
[03:07:02] <Mark__> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/index.php?mid=htmlcss&page=1
[03:07:11] <Cork> i can't edit that so it won't help
[03:07:17] <Mark__> okay..;
[03:07:37] <Mark__> im just wondering is there any css or jquery if needed that adjusts to auto heights
[03:07:42] <Cork> http://www.lipsum.com/ is nice if you need content
[03:07:48] <Mark__> sec.
[03:08:20] <hellyeah> man
[03:08:25] <hellyeah> it didnt work damn it http://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/11/
[03:08:58] <Mark__> don’t damn us
[03:09:15] <hellyeah> i didnt damn you :XD
[03:09:27] <Mark__> but you are still damning the environment.
[03:09:29] <Mark__> :p
[03:09:31] <Cork> hellyeah: ya, that looks like the problem i remember
[03:09:41] <Cork> now the draggable works
[03:09:47] <Cork> just not if you drag the button
[03:11:15] <hellyeah> ah okey http://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/13/
[03:11:18] <Cork> oh...
[03:11:22] <Cork> now this is interesting
[03:11:26] <Cork> https://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-cancel
[03:12:08] <hellyeah> why do i cancel it?
[03:12:21] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/14/
[03:12:53] <Cork> quote: 'Default: "input,textarea,button,select,option"'
[03:12:54] <Mark__> http://jsfiddle.net/zyeqe1fr/
[03:13:00] <Mark__> cork this is the problem im having http://jsfiddle.net/zyeqe1fr/
[03:13:33] <Cork> Mark__: https://jsfiddle.net/zyeqe1fr/1/
[03:13:59] <Mark__> that doesn’t cover the whole contents though
[03:14:08] <Mark__> it needs to cover all the contents inside it.
[03:14:17] <Mark__> and be able to adjust itself on the auto heights..
[03:14:19] <Cork> ya, cause you asked for 100vh of the parent
[03:14:25] <Mark__> ….
[03:14:26] <Mark__> okay.
[03:14:29] <hellyeah> btw vw and vh has scroll problem
[03:14:31] <hellyeah> afaik
[03:14:32] <Cork> so the box becomes 100vh of the body
[03:14:38] <Cork> that is 100vh of the viewport
[03:14:42] <Mark__> oh well,
[03:14:44] <Cork> Mark__: so your logic is flawed
[03:14:54] <Mark__> then i should look for jquery plugin that adjusts to auto heights..
[03:14:57] <Mark__> thanks for yout help
[03:15:01] <Mark__> that helped a lot i guess.
[03:15:11] <Cork> Mark__: or just let the box be block or inline
[03:15:54] <Cork> Mark__: https://jsfiddle.net/zyeqe1fr/2/
[03:16:11] <Mark__> what’s the secret?
[03:16:18] <Cork> i removed height
[03:16:33] <Cork> and made the box element size to the content of the element
[03:17:17] <Cork> what you asked for was "ignore your content and make it 100vh of your parent instead"
[03:17:28] <Cork> and that is exactly what you got
[03:17:52] <Cork> hellyeah: they don't
[03:18:05] <Cork> has scroll problem i mean
[03:19:15] <hellyeah> btw i want to get x and y cordinates of button after dropping element. Is it true logic to use museup? https://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/18/
[03:19:33] <Cork> no
[03:19:40] <Cork> use the drop event from draggable
[03:19:59] <Cork> https://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#event-drop
[03:20:46] <Mark__> okay, i think it has something to do with the positon fixed
[03:20:53] <Mark__> but anyways, thanks
[03:21:09] <hellyeah> lemme take a look
[03:21:15] <Cork> Mark__: position fixed of the background element means it ignores the page height and scroll position
[03:21:29] <Cork> Mark__: the box is just that i let the content control that elements size
[03:21:39] <Cork> so it was two separate problems
[03:22:26] <Mark__> right now i can’t seem to focus on your points but appreciate your work indeed.
[03:23:14] <Mark__> i accidentally thought this was css channel for a minute
[03:24:16] <hellyeah> brb
[03:24:52] <hellyeah> Mark__: when you do position:fixed elemet will follo0w your scroll
[03:25:10] <Mark__> okay.
[03:26:06] <Mark__> could you take a look at this code and if im making a mistake? http://jsfiddle.net/scwqqsne/
[03:26:25] <Mark__> i need to execute that .animateNumber after the contents are loaded
[03:26:34] <Mark__> and seems like it’s not working.
[03:26:55] <Mark__> *see if
[03:27:20] <hellyeah> you want to do something like loading with some animöation before page load
[03:27:23] <hellyeah> ?
[03:27:30] <hellyeah> animation*
[03:27:31] <Cork> Mark__: and the .load() is the one loading the content?
[03:27:39] <Mark__> yes. um
[03:27:53] <Cork> then that should work
[03:27:54] <Mark__> yeah. that’s not actually what i wrote but it should be.
[03:28:00] <Mark__> yeah that’s what i thought but
[03:28:04] <Mark__> all i get in returen is
[03:28:10] <Mark__> unexpected } or something
[03:28:12] <Mark__> let me check.
[03:28:14] <Cork> ah
[03:28:47] <Mark__> Unexpected token }
[03:28:48] <hellyeah> Mark__: that site is interesting btw if it server your purpose http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/#animated
[03:29:07] <Mark__> thakns for the recommendation
[03:29:26] <hellyeah> brb
[03:29:26] <Cork> Mark__: like i said last time {$oDocument - > get('readed_count')} is the only problem i can see
[03:29:45] <Mark__> um, it’s a fully working code so, there shouldn’t be any problem,
[03:29:45] <Cork> just for test purposes try replacing it with a static number
[03:29:46] <Mark__> in fact,
[03:29:49] <Mark__> yeah
[03:29:53] <Mark__> that’s what i did exactly.
[03:30:00] <Mark__> and im still getting the same thing.
[03:30:04] <Mark__> so.
[03:30:19] <Cork> Mark__: look at what code the script generates
[03:30:33] <Cork> meaning look at what the browser actually gets instead of what your server script executes
[03:30:34] <Mark__> it doesn’t tell me exact line
[03:30:41] <Mark__> right.
[03:30:43] <Mark__> how do i do that?!
[03:30:58] <Cork> uh open the script file in the browsers developer tools?
[03:31:07] <Mark__> hmm sec
[03:31:31] <Cork> (this is why i never allow preprocessing in javascript)
[03:31:46] <Mark__> it shows blank file.
[03:31:56] <Mark__> but let’s rather move on to another practical thing
[03:32:14] <Mark__> i forgot the question
[03:32:14] <Mark__> sec
[03:32:18] <Mark__> oh yeah,
[03:32:31] <Mark__> how do you close all the functions within a div layer?
[03:32:32] <Mark__> like,
[03:32:43] <Mark__> i know empty() does
[03:32:51] <Mark__> and removeClass and hide() don't/
[03:32:56] <Cork> does what?
[03:33:09] <Mark__> it empties functions added to the dom i guess
[03:33:12] <Cork> functions within a div layer makes no sense...
[03:33:14] <Mark__> if i remember it corectly.
[03:33:25] <Cork> what functions are you talking about?
[03:33:26] <Mark__> but you understand what im trying to say...
[03:33:29] <Mark__> sec.
[03:33:49] <Mark__> for example, i have a div layer that’s shown by executing addClass
[03:34:01] <Cork> what is a div layer?
[03:34:03] <Mark__> the contents are of course get loaded using .load
[03:34:18] <Mark__> traditional div in html im talking about..
[03:34:26] <Cork> so a dom div...
[03:34:40] <Mark__> did i not put that adaquetely sorry.
[03:34:49] <Mark__> i need to learn how to say thing in correct  order
[03:34:58] <Mark__> but you get the point.
[03:35:07] <Cork> you load remote content into a div ya
[03:35:08] <Cork> and?
[03:35:09] <Mark__> and a youtube player runs inside of that layer.
[03:35:23] <Cork> stop with the layer...
[03:35:23] <Mark__> when i close the layer by using removeClass.show
[03:35:31] <Mark__> it doesn’t stop the player yeah.
[03:35:47] <Mark__> i’ve already tried what i can do
[03:35:51] <Mark__> but there isn’t really practical way.
[03:36:04] <Cork> ok, i'm going to try to translate this into something semi understandable
[03:36:10] <Mark__> okay.
[03:36:19] <Cork> you have a div and inside that div you load in iframe with youtube
[03:36:31] <Cork> and you want the video to stop playing by hiding the iframe?
[03:36:37] <Cork> why would those two be related?
[03:36:50] <Mark__> idk, i’ve never said anything about just hiding the layer.
[03:37:00] <Cork> then you make no sense
[03:37:05] <Mark__> okay.
[03:37:28] <Mark__> lecture me.
[03:37:45] <Cork> as i don't have a clue what your asking for i can't...
[03:37:52] <Mark__> ...
[03:37:56] <Mark__> okay. thanks
[03:38:01] <Cork> you load html into a div through ajax
[03:38:06] <Cork> that is about where things end for me
[03:38:38] <Mark__> just removing the contents,simple as that
[03:38:54] <Mark__> i think i should look for jquery plugins for it
[03:39:00] <Mark__> but thanks anyways.
[03:39:05] <Cork> so you want to empty the div...
[03:39:09] <Mark__> yeah...
[03:39:12] <Cork> that is what .empty() is for
[03:39:32] <Mark__> and as i have said it doesn’t open a layer if i click on the thumbnails afterwards
[03:39:38] <Mark__> it’s one time ticket
[03:39:41] <Cork> and again what layer...
[03:39:45] <Mark__> to remove the contents and never come back
[03:40:06] <Mark__> so…
[03:41:13] <Cork> Mark__: .empty() on an element takes the innerHTML = "" and cleans up jquerys data object for said elements
[03:41:38] <Cork> Mark__: if something somewhere else holds a referece to this content or the original html code
[03:41:46] <Cork> .empty() won't have any effect on that
[03:42:36] <Mark__> i think i get slightest sense of what you are trying to say
[03:42:40] <Mark__> i’ll try one more time.
[03:44:26] <Mark__> thanks, it works.
[03:44:35] <Mark__> i must have been doing it in a stupid way.
[03:44:57] <Cork> you really need to learn up on the standard names though
[03:45:08] <Cork> cause you really makes it hard to understand with all those made up words
[03:45:09] <Mark__> standard names?
[03:45:13] <Mark__> ah
[03:45:22] <Mark__> i am known for coming up with my own names of things..
[03:45:24] <Mark__> but okay
[03:45:32] <Mark__> im not a english speaker really.
[03:45:41] <Mark__> i’ll try to make more sense
[03:45:44] <Cork> layer has a meaning in browsers
[03:45:44] <Mark__> if there is any..
[03:45:54] <Mark__> or photoshop..
[03:45:56] <Cork> but you use it for something completely different
[03:46:04] <Mark__> okay sorry.
[03:46:09] <Mark__> can i still go to heaven of god
[03:46:10] <Cork> photoshop is a different standard at least
[03:46:42] <Mark__> are you offended by the namings?
[03:46:43] <Cork> but here has a reference in the context but you talk about it as something completely different and that makes things extreamly hard to understand
[03:46:48] <Mark__> i thought it has some practical sense
[03:46:52] <Mark__> if not i appologize.
[03:47:00] <Cork> no, just that it made a fairly simple question very very hard
[03:47:04] <Uhkis> Mark__: it's not about getting offended, it's about being understood
[03:47:23] <Mark__> okay. cool
[03:47:42] <hellyeah> hey
[03:47:45] <Mark__> or it could be the way i put the whole explanation sentences
[03:47:51] <Mark__> but im trying.
[03:48:03] <hellyeah> why i didnt see alert box when i drop the element? Can you take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/23/
[03:48:29] <Cork> hellyeah: it should be in the same initialization call
[03:49:03] <Cork> hellyeah: please try to think about the problem your self in stead of throwing it in here before you even try
[03:49:29] <Cork> asking for help is fine, but at least make a valid effort your self first
[03:52:07] <hellyeah> hmm both are in the same function i understood like that sorry i guess i understood wrong.
[03:52:48] <Cork> hellyeah: .droppable(options).droppable(options) looks like in one function?
[03:54:39] <hellyeah> something like that? http://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/25/
[03:54:57] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:55:19] <hellyeah> sorry

[04:26:56] <Mark__> is there a way i can set auto scroll to top when click on a button?
[04:27:13] <Mark__> it’ s rather open at the tope rather than scrolling to top..
[04:27:16] <Mark__> *top
[04:27:32] <Cork> Mark__: you can when a link is clicked
[04:27:49] <Mark__> um what about just a jquery on click?
[04:27:55] <Cork> sure
[04:28:05] <Cork> <a href="#top">
[04:28:19] <Cork> or window.scrollY = 0
[04:30:25] <Mark__> jQuery(document).scrollTop(); doesn’t seem to work
[05:22:26] <Mark__> is there a way i can bind ajaxSetup to a specific ajaxcall? otherwise EVERY ajax call initiates spinners when something is functioning using ajax. http://jsfiddle.net/ggdg5z41/

[06:27:55] <sigdk> hello. I'd like to experiment with these examples: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#entry-examples   I'm using the code provided at the end, but how exactly do I incorporate the code snippets given at the rest of the page ?
[06:30:07] <Cork> sigdk: not sure what it is you have problem with
[06:30:31] <Cork> each option have an example section for how you set things
[06:31:50] <Cork> sigdk: you mean something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/bhyehtdd/
[06:34:16] <sigdk> Cork, what does this do: $( ".selector" ). ... ?
[06:34:22] <sigdk> selects all the tabs ?
[06:34:40] <Cork> sigdk: that is a psudo code snippet
[06:35:04] <Cork> $(".selector") is meant to be replaced with your selector used to select the element you want to target
[06:35:24] <Cork> sigdk: that page is a documentation not a tutorial
[06:35:54] <sigdk> Cork, what I want to do is this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/502391/jquery-tabs-load-contents-only-when-clicked
[06:35:56] <Cork> https://jqueryui.com/tabs/ might be of more interest if you want working demos and some explanation
[06:36:32] <sigdk> the second most popular answer mentions jqueryui
[06:37:13] <Cork> well every thing on so is solved with jquery
[06:37:23] <Cork> so is a pile of shit when it comes to this area
[06:38:12] <hellyeah> when you drag and drop button it works fine but when you move up button i cannot put button to same position. Can you help me to figure out reason of that http://jsfiddle.net/fru2k1q3/4/
[06:39:41] <sigdk> Cork, one more 'noob'-question: what's the difference in writing the js code in the way you did, instead of: $(function() { $("#tabs").tabs().tabs("disable", 2); });    enclosing it essentially in $(function)...
[06:39:42] <sigdk> ?
[06:40:07] <Cork> sigdk: jsfiddle wraps the code in onload by default
[06:40:24] <Cork> $(function() {}) is a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {});
[06:40:38] <Cork> and it does a similar thing but runs much earlier then .onload does
[06:40:49] <Cork> so you won't get a flicker where the dome exist and renders wrong
[06:40:55] <Cork> dome==dom
[06:41:13] <Cork> sigdk: https://api.jquery.com/ready/
[06:41:25] <Uhkis> Under the DOM, new horror series from W3C
[06:41:38] <Cork> sigdk: also you might want to read through https://learn.jquery.com/
[06:41:57] <Cork> it will teach you the basics of jquery, something you will have to understand to use jquery ui
[06:42:08] <sigdk> is that a tutorial ?
[06:42:11] <Cork> yes

[07:11:43] <goldbug> Hey guys. If I have a div with id 'language_link' and it contains more than one links, how can I retrieve the text of the link that was clicked on? $(this).text() returns the text for all the links in the div.
[07:12:24] <Cork> goldbug: you have to bind a click event handler to do that
[07:12:53] <Cork> something like $('#language_link').on('click', 'a', function() { console.log($(this).text()); });
[07:14:05] <goldbug> Cork: Cheers! I had one of those but without the 'a'.
[07:14:19] <Cork> goldbug: look into jquery delegation
[07:14:46] <Cork> goldbug: if you don't have the delegated syntax "this" will be the div not the link
[07:16:06] <goldbug> Cork: Got it - very useful to know!
[07:16:43] <khurram> hi all
[07:16:55] <Cork> goldbug: might be of interest reading https://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:17:16] <khurram> can someone please help me how to attach an event handler using mobilejquery for all list <a href > items on fly
[07:17:17] <PokerGod> i have a datatable setup.  When i do; $('#mytable').closest('sect').children().detach();  it seems to mess up data tables, in the sense that $.fn.dataTable.isDataTable('#mytable') now returns false.  Why is that?
[07:18:28] <goldbug> Follow-up question. My function changes the value of a dropdown. I also have an event listener listening for a change in that dropdown, but it doesn't seem to be being triggered when the value is being changed by jQuery. How come?
[07:19:14] <taplar> logical changes to elements typically don't fire the change event
[07:19:17] <taplar> they just do it
[07:19:32] <taplar> so you'd need to trigger it yourself
[07:19:39] <hellyeah> i need an idea
[07:20:36] <khurram> please can some help me
[07:20:46] <khurram> with jquerymobile using on cordova android
[07:20:54] <goldbug> taplar: Well damn.
[07:21:30] <hellyeah> you can drag and drop button here http://jsfiddle.net/fru2k1q3/4/ what i want to do is to make something like div when you drag button onto another button. For this thing, i have this idea make x and y cordinate all buttons and put those into array. And  when you drag and drop button, get the new cordinates and ccompare with array if there is a mat
[07:21:30] <hellyeah> ch. Make a div and put those buttons into div. Does it sound logical?
[07:22:00] <hellyeah> or is there a simpler way in jquery for doing this?
[07:22:36] <taplar> hellyeah: what problem are you trying to solve?
[07:23:00] <taplar> goldbug: it's not that hard to trigger the event in logic
[07:23:34] <taplar> goldbug: it's either $element.change() or $element.trigger('change')
[07:23:43] <hellyeah> taplar: you know smart phone when you move app onto another app. square is created and those two buttons are replaced there right
[07:23:53] <taplar> nope.  not a mobile guy
[07:24:07] <hellyeah> no no mobile actually but i know this logic right
[07:24:20] <hellyeah> i want to do similar thing
[07:24:28] <hellyeah> you can drag and drop the button
[07:24:33] <taplar> y?
[07:24:59] <hellyeah> when you move button onto another button i want to put thos two buttons into same place
[07:25:10] <taplar> is this still related to your http log page?
[07:25:19] <hellyeah> yes
[07:25:25] <taplar> so yeah...  why?
[07:25:27] <Uhkis> khurram: not unless you ask
[07:25:33] <Mark__> ah
[07:25:37] <Mark__> still asking questions huh
[07:25:39] <hellyeah> i dont know my manager asked me to do
[07:25:51] <taplar> ask him why
[07:25:58] <taplar> this mysterious manager you keep mentioning
[07:25:58] <hellyeah> i will explain
[07:26:12] <hellyeah> they want to group buttons
[07:26:33] <hellyeah> you know some buttons can have simlarity
[07:26:33] <Uhkis> just tell him "i have no idea what i'm doing, irc is basically doing my job" ;D
[07:26:44] <hellyeah> he wants to see them in same place
[07:26:52] <taplar> so sort them
[07:26:54] <hellyeah> :XD
[07:26:59] <hellyeah> i already did it
[07:27:03] <taplar> okay?
[07:27:09] <hellyeah> not okey
[07:27:14] <hellyeah> unfortunately
[07:28:14] <taplar> i really don't understand.  this is for a bank, right?
[07:28:23] <hellyeah> yes
[07:28:27] <taplar> so for internal use only?
[07:28:33] <hellyeah> yes
[07:28:42] <hellyeah> i also dont understand
[07:28:45] <taplar> so yeah.  i don't understand.  why are you trying to make it really fancy
[07:28:51] <hellyeah> i am just try to swim in the dark see
[07:29:01] <taplar> you've been working on this for at least two months
[07:29:13] <taplar> and most of the things your tying to do are cosmetic flare
[07:29:15] <hellyeah> i wrote so many things
[07:29:27] <taplar> it's an internal page.  it just needs to work
[07:29:38] <Uhkis> here's hoping hellyeah gets paid by hour :)
[07:29:51] <hellyeah> xD
[07:30:10] <hellyeah> btw first time taplar you helped me a lot and now i can write something on my own
[07:30:25] <hellyeah> but this requirement seems not make sense
[07:30:28] <taplar> that's cool, and a good thing.  but my point is still valid
[07:30:34] <taplar> imho
[07:31:20] <hellyeah> taplar: i wrote so many things
[07:31:46] <hellyeah> he wants to see last changes in the page if user recall the page
[07:31:57] <hellyeah> like closing and opening again
[07:32:07] <hellyeah> i found a way pushState
[07:32:12] <taplar> do you have the page working?
[07:32:21] <hellyeah> online?
[07:32:23] <taplar> yes
[07:32:32] <hellyeah> i plan to get hose and domain
[07:32:37] <hellyeah> host*
[07:32:39] <taplar> wait
[07:32:43] <taplar> you said this was for a bank
[07:32:55] <hellyeah> no no i mean for my study
[07:33:01] <taplar> huh?
[07:33:19] <hellyeah> i try to learn these
[07:33:33] <hellyeah> and i am coding js, designing so many works here
[07:33:39] <hellyeah> i am doing also database design
[07:33:51] <taplar> so you don't have an environment in your company to develop on?
[07:33:56] <hellyeah> and not even one person i can ask here arond me
[07:34:10] <hellyeah> local environment
[07:34:28] <taplar> you don't have a develop/preprod environment?
[07:34:37] <hellyeah> not yet
[07:34:40] <taplar> holy crap
[07:35:04] <hellyeah> my development environment is jsfiddle
[07:35:06] <hellyeah> xD
[07:35:09] <taplar> so how can your qa, please tell me you have qa, test it before it goes to production?
[07:35:32] <hellyeah> we have test environment
[07:35:35] <hellyeah> i didnt use it yet
[07:35:46] <hellyeah> i try to finish js part
[07:36:00] <taplar> so you need to use that.  you need to get the screen -working-.  without the cosmetic flare crap.  just get it working
[07:36:01] <hellyeah> there is always requirement so developing js never finish
[07:36:05] <taplar> then the flare can be enhancements
[07:36:22] <hellyeah> i can put all things together
[07:36:29] <hellyeah> and this will work perfectly
[07:36:49] <hellyeah> but since i do stuff everytime i mean i do everythings he asked me to do
[07:36:55] <hellyeah> he wants new things
[07:37:09] <hellyeah> this is like process of my life nowadays it never ends
[07:37:10] <taplar> yep, you need to work on your mvp
[07:37:11] <hellyeah> DAMN
[07:37:49] <hellyeah> taplar: can we back to topic if you dont mind i need an idea?
[07:38:08] <taplar> i'm really hesitant to help at this point.
[07:38:20] <taplar> i feel like i'd be helping you continue down a bad path
[07:38:40] <taplar> you need to get your mvp working
[07:38:45] <taplar> and go from there
[07:39:08] <hellyeah> can you explain me what does continue down mean?
[07:39:43] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product
[07:40:22] <hellyeah> okey
[07:40:48] <hellyeah> thank you btw i didnt intend to for you to help me anytime i hope you didnt feel like that
[07:42:17] <taplar> helping you doesn't always mean helping you code, :)
[07:42:36] <hellyeah> yes
[07:43:08] <hellyeah> taplar: can i be honest? May be he wants those stuff for testing me or for making innovation
[07:43:21] <hellyeah> honestly i dont know but i need to handle this :o
[07:43:26] <taplar> and right now it really seems like your stuck in the loop of making a change and the user asking for more
[07:43:36] <taplar> so your never going to finish
[07:43:39] <hellyeah> because you know some requirement sounds like sort of fantasy
[07:43:58] <taplar> which is one of the reasons a more iterative approach can be very useful
[07:44:07] <hellyeah> taplar: what should i do? should i ask when we finish these?_
[07:44:16] <taplar> make your mvp
[07:44:28] <hellyeah> okey
[07:44:34] <taplar> find out, without the bells and whistles, what will make the screen -work-
[07:44:37] <hellyeah> and continue from there right
[07:44:38] <taplar> make that
[07:44:42] <taplar> then, ask what they think
[07:44:54] <taplar> get feedback, make small changes
[07:44:56] <taplar> show them again
[07:45:01] <taplar> get feedback
[07:45:06] <taplar> repeat repeat repeat
[07:45:38] <hellyeah> hey that seems sensible approach
[07:45:48] <taplar> not only sensible
[07:45:55] <hellyeah> pratic
[07:45:56] <taplar> but the users don't have to wait to get something they can use
[07:46:08] <hellyeah> i am bored really
[07:46:39] <hellyeah> anyway brb
[07:46:43] <hellyeah> i need to smoke
[07:49:48] <momomo> is tehre a way (not using jquery ) to attach a method  or property to a dom element?
[07:49:55] <momomo> i know in jquery you can use element.data('') but without jquery, is there a way ?
[07:50:31] <Cork> momomo: well you can do exactly what .data does
[07:50:34] <momomo> if not, how does jquery do that? doing e.property = somethign .. from previous experience doesnt stick .. not sure why
[07:50:49] <momomo> Cork, yes, how does jqueyr do that ?
[07:50:58] <Mark__> megamistype
[07:51:11] <Cork> momomo: it sets a reference number as a property on the dom element
[07:51:19] <Cork> and then uses that id as a reference in an object
[07:52:10] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data/Data.js#L8 <-- the id
[07:52:59] <Cork> and the value lookup https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data/Data.js#L18
[07:53:09] <momomo> Cork, really, i've never noticed a refernce attribute on the element .. let me check
[07:53:11] <Cork> and value storage https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data/Data.js#L32
[07:53:46] <Cork> momomo: it should be a property like jQuery1113006540101621265832
[07:54:05] <momomo> Cork, a property or an attribute ?
[07:54:11] <Cork> property
[07:54:17] <Cork> attributes would only be strings
[07:54:54] <Cork> momomo: also setting the property on a dom element should stick
[07:55:00] <Cork> momomo: as long as you don't replace the dom element
[07:55:01] <momomo> but how are they able to store a property, at all .. i can attribute key to object working though .. but the entire question is more about how they even set one/many property
[07:55:08] <Cork> they don't the browser does
[07:55:32] <momomo> Cork, previous experience have suggested settign a proiperty dopsn't stick ...
[07:56:17] <momomo> otherwise what is the purpose of data
[07:57:12] <momomo> i think maybe hmm
[07:57:19] <Cork> momomo: https://jsfiddle.net/9j7qzavy/
[07:57:28] <momomo> i think it's jquery('body').eee = 'aa' doesn't stick
[07:57:36] <momomo> get(0).eee = 'does'
[07:57:37] <Cork> momomo: that isnt a dom element
[07:57:49] <Cork> jquery('body') <-- this gives you a jquery object
[07:58:00] <Cork> and jQuery() creates a new object each time it is called
[07:58:02] <momomo> Cork, yes, preferable that should be the same
[07:58:04] <momomo> each time
[07:58:15] <Cork> that isn't really doable
[07:58:32] <momomo> Cork, yes, i guess you'd have to detect changes and such
[07:58:33] <Cork> cause then jquery would have to keep a cache of all the selected results you've ever queried in the page
[07:58:41] <Cork> momomo: not only that
[07:58:50] <Cork> you would have to store everything ever selected :/
[07:59:10] <momomo> Cork, references, is that costly ?
[07:59:31] <Cork> momomo: it will keep removed dom elements around
[07:59:47] <Cork> so you would have to write a gc that walks the history and remove old dead dom elements to free the memory
[07:59:48] <Mark__> does anybody know why .post or .load won’t load input boxes?
[07:59:50] <Cork> so ya
[08:00:01] <Cork> Mark__: it does
[08:00:13] <Cork> heck most of my pages wouldn't work if they didn't
[08:00:16] <Mark__> well it doesn’t for my case. something must have gone wrong.
[08:00:21] <momomo> mm .. yes, exactly the kind of problem I am facing now .. to clean up elements that are deleted from dom so they no longer subscribe to events
[08:00:37] <Cork> Mark__:  you're looking at the wrong place
[08:01:02] <Cork> momomo: when you remove elements from the dom they don't subscribe to events
[08:01:22] <Cork> momomo: that is part of what the browsers gc does
[08:01:26] <Mark__> what do you mean im looking at the wrong place?
[08:01:44] <Cork> Mark__: it isn't the $.post/$().load that causes the problem
[08:01:50] <Cork> look else where
[08:01:51] <Mark__> hmm, maybe
[08:02:01] <Cork> uh...
[08:06:05] <momomo> Cork, the problem i am facing has to do .. with for instance a nav subscribing on bar-menu.click event ... when the nav is deleted from dom, but bar is not .. the nav will be removed but the subsribtion would in fact still be in placve .. to remove the subscribtiion i would have to know when the nav is remove and unsubsribe .. i guess there isn't an event to listen when an element is removed  ?
[08:06:43] <momomo> it's not jquery based events
[08:07:30] <Cork> momomo: well there are a few ways you could solve that
[08:07:49] <Cork> you could have a function that when you remove the first element you remove the event on the second
[08:08:08] <Cork> or you could have the event handler on the nav check if the target is in the dom, and if it isn't clean it self up
[08:08:33] <Cork> momomo: or you could use delegated event handlers and not need to have a cache like this at all (the best solution)
[08:09:32] <momomo> Cork, the first one is difficult, as I can not know really who removes it and how .. and they also live independently of each other
[08:09:38] <momomo> the second one is pretty good
[08:10:04] <momomo> i am not sure i understand the third one thouhg
[08:10:31] <momomo> delegated event handlers ?
[08:10:35] <momomo> the nav would ?
[08:10:38] <Cork> momomo: for example you can have a $('nav').on('click', '.bar-menu', function() {})
[08:11:07] <Cork> then you can do $('#other container .$(this).data('target')).<action>()
[08:11:14] <Cork> opps
[08:11:30] <Cork> meant $('#other-container .' + $(this).data('target')).<action>()
[08:11:39] <Cork> then you don't have to keep what element reference what around at all
[08:12:10] <Cork> and things will just connect the refereces by what exists in the dom
[08:13:44] <momomo> i take it this is the key -> $('nav').on('click', '.bar-menu', function() {}) ... it will hook into anything with .bar-menu clic k
[08:13:54] <Cork> ya
[08:13:56] <momomo> is this expensive ?
[08:14:01] <Cork> no
[08:14:10] <Cork> the opposite
[08:14:26] <Cork> $('nav').on('click', '.bar-menu', function() {}) requires less work
[08:14:36] <Cork> then $('nav .bar-menu').on('click', function() {})
[08:14:50] <Cork> also the later slows down the dom
[08:14:52] <momomo> hmm interesting .. is order significant here ?
[08:15:05] <Cork> order?
[08:15:17] <Cork> momomo: it is event delegation
[08:15:27] <Cork> one binds ONE event handler on nav
[08:15:41] <Cork> then listens for all matching events bubbling up from elements matching the selector
[08:15:52] <Cork> the other one selects all elements that exists and loops them
[08:16:02] <Cork> and then binds one event handler on each element if found
[08:16:25] <Cork> event handlers makes the browser do more work for every event, so they are kinda expensive
[08:17:12] <momomo> i still have to bind $('.bar-menu').click(function{ }) ?? will it trigger the nav or do i have to do soemthing to trigger it ?
[08:17:30] <Cork> momomo: events bubble in the dom
[08:17:35] <Cork> so no you don't have to do anything
[08:17:52] <momomo> i don't have to even binf $('.bar-menu') ?
[08:17:59] <Cork> nope
[08:19:31] <momomo> hmm .. so any click will have to check for a match against that one ... so if I use this exensively .. on 20 things .. then an event happens, a click ... that will bubble up and it would have to check all those for a match .. and not a simple match, for all kinds of mathces, no? .bar-menu #bar-menu someattribute['aa'] .someclass .bar-menu ... no ?
[08:19:50] <momomo> now i am more curious how it will actually trigger the event
[08:20:19] <momomo> am i making sense ?
[08:21:21] <PapaSierra> i'm trying to understand the use of jQuery.noConflict(true). specifically, i'm writing an embeddable widget. the host page (3rd party) might have jQuery or other on it already. therefore i'm writing an anonymous function which loads its own jQuery and then executes my code. now i want to use jQuery plugins. how do i include those plugins to extend MY jQuery and not the host page's jQuery?
[08:21:53] <Cork> momomo: https://jsfiddle.net/tL7j3s6s/
[08:22:06] <Cork> momomo: no you don't have to, that is what delegate does
[08:22:39] <Cork> momomo: you can implement delegate your self by binding the event handler as $('nav').click(function() {});
[08:22:48] <Cork> and do all the selector checking in the callback
[08:22:49] <momomo> Cork, does this assume that bar-menu is nested in nav ?
[08:22:59] <Cork> ya
[08:23:13] <momomo> i did say they were indepedent :p
[08:23:15] <Cork> the delegator has to be a parent
[08:23:28] <Cork> momomo: and i gave you a solution for that
[08:23:36] <momomo> yes, number two was good
[08:23:42] <Cork> no
[08:23:51] <momomo> no?
[08:23:55] <Cork> that was part of number three too
[08:24:22] <Cork> "<Cork> then you can do $('#other container .$(this).data('target')).<action>()" <--
[08:24:39] <Cork> gah, i copied the broken line...
[08:24:49] <momomo> i was thinking of this: "or you could have the event handler on the nav check if the target is in the dom, and if it isn't clean it self up"
[08:25:15] <Cork> momomo: but that still means you have to do the extra cache of the elements
[08:25:15] <momomo> although i interpreted it differntly ... the listen event function could, when triggered check if it is still in dom
[08:25:30] <momomo> if not, clean itself
[08:25:45] <Cork> or you could just not duplicate the code
[08:26:23] <hellyeah> taplar: thanks for the link btw
[08:26:34] <hellyeah> in short i will prepare my mvp
[08:26:49] <Cork> PapaSierra: i strongly recommend against that solution
[08:27:15] <taplar> cool
[08:27:16] <Cork> PapaSierra: it is a living nightmare both for performance and gettings things to work if the widget packs everything and tries to be smart
[08:27:39] <hellyeah> taplar: can i ask about my idea in that case?
[08:27:56] <Cork> PapaSierra: instead say that jquery is required, and provide a way to either just call it as $.yourWidget
[08:28:04] <Cork> PapaSierra: and then just use that jquery for the action
[08:28:25] <taplar> work on your mvp dude
[08:28:28] <Cork> or if you need to work separately provide a way to state it should be something other then the defauilt jQuery
[08:28:52] <Cork> PapaSierra: forcing pages to load an additional jquery lib is a really really bad idea
[08:29:04] <hellyeah> hmm okey i will prepare mvp out of office
[08:29:15] <Cork> (and will force sites to have to patch your code to remove that problem)
[08:33:27] <PapaSierra> Cork: mine is a booking widget. so the ingredients i'll need are: cors/jsonp GET, cors/some hack POST, dom handling, date picker, business logic. approach 1) include my private version of jQuery: i should be completely insulated from scripts on the host page, but can't figure out a way to use plugins properly, plus you say it's a bad idea. approach 2) tell the host page they need to include jQuery > 1.5 < 2 and then clutter their copy o
[08:33:27] <PapaSierra> f jQuery with my plugins, and just trust that that's ok?
[08:34:02] <Cork> PapaSierra: that is the wrong way of thinking
[08:34:19] <Cork> PapaSierra: set a min requirement of jquery, and just let the site load things
[08:34:46] <Cork> else you force sites to either load two versions of jquery (a blocker for many) or to patch your code to remove it
[08:35:09] <Cork> PapaSierra: let the set admin do what they are there for admin the site
[08:35:14] <Cork> ste=site
[08:35:32] <PapaSierra> Cork: so you are pointing to approach #2, correct? (with some graceful failure message)
[08:36:03] <Cork> PapaSierra: if you really feel you have to, i wouldn't even go that far
[08:36:17] <Cork> just provide a clean documentation of what is required (shouldn't have to be many lines)
[08:36:44] <Cork> just be reproducable and fail in the same way
[08:36:48] <Cork> that is what is important
[08:37:08] <PapaSierra> ok great. and as for noConflict(true)? how does that work? what if their site has mootools or something else in it?
[08:37:13] <Cork> cause when things randomly explode here and there is when life becomes a pain
[08:37:56] <Cork> PapaSierra: a site loads a lib that uses $ and then calls $.noConflict() jquery hands back $ to what ever used it before it was loaded
[08:38:17] <Cork> $.noConflict(true) hands back the definition of jQuery too
[08:38:26] <Cork> but this is _not_ something a widget should ever touch
[08:38:57] <sebb_> yo !
[08:39:55] <sebb_> I've got select and I need to cut it's options. So from select with 10 options I need to make select with 5 options
[08:40:01] <sebb_> But I do not want to use remove
[08:40:06] <sebb_> I'd like to hide it somehow
[08:40:56] <PapaSierra> Cork: so if i'm simply loading code that depends on jQuery (having told the host page developer that jQuery must be loaded first) and then loads in some plugins, there is no case whatsoever for me to ever call noConflict(), correct?
[08:41:30] <Cork> PapaSierra: there are but that would mean you would have to always load a separate jquery lib
[08:41:44] <Cork> forcing the page to make an extra ~1.5mb download for no reason
[08:42:01] <Cork> PapaSierra: you should not include third party plugins automatically either
[08:42:09] <Cork> just say you depend on them
[08:42:25] <Cork> PapaSierra: the site might want to use a slightly modified version
[08:42:27] <Cork> for what ever reason
[08:42:59] <Cork> and this is a case when doing it for them actually hurts instead
[08:43:26] <Cork> PapaSierra: you could provide a boilerplate html snippet that does it all for them
[08:43:31] <Cork> then they just need to copy paste it
[08:43:36] <Kingsy> what am I missing here --> var sHeight = $('#console')[0].scrollHeight; $('#console').scrollTop(sHeight); <-- I want a div always to be scrolled to the bottom.
[08:43:40] <Cork> or modify it the way they like to do it
[08:44:20] <hellyeah> [0]
[08:44:24] <Cork> no
[08:44:41] <Cork> Kingsy: that should work as long as the console is actually what is overflowing
[08:44:57] <Cork> Kingsy: also you can replace [0].scrollHeigh with .prop('scrollHeight')
[08:45:04] <Cork> i at least find that easier on the eye
[08:45:59] <Kingsy> thanks.. I was thinking the code was correct.
[08:46:08] <Kingsy> just checking I wasnt being an idiot.
[08:47:54] <PapaSierra> Cork ok, i'm trying to wrap my head around this. my embed code consists of a <script> and <div>. the script would be a compiled minified collection of my code an a couple of plugins. one such plugin is jquery-ui's datepicker and then i have provided a plugin that duck punches it to give the behaviour i need. i'm scared to force this into their window.jQuery
[09:55:35] <momomo> what is the best way to determine if an element has been removed from dom ?
[09:55:42] <momomo> I know there is document.contains(element) but that might expensive?
[11:29:10] <printForever> Can anyone please asssit? I've been trying to find a solution online, I tried making something of my own... Does not work...
[11:31:02] <printForever> maybe trying to select last option element?
[11:31:50] <printForever> something like scrollBottom($("select").find("option:last-child")
[11:33:13] <printForever> but there isn't scrollBottom in jQuery, only scrollTop
[11:33:36] <printForever> shoky, do you mind taking a look at this problem?
[12:02:02] <goldbug> Any thoughts on why this event (language_link) is only being triggered the first time I click on a link? It works correctly - reloading part of the page (a Rails partial) - but then clicking on a similar link does nothing. https://gist.github.com/classicgoldbug/69bcd036410fa914a838
[12:02:44] <robertmaxrees> could you share the rendered HTML and the actuall, non-coffeescript JS?
[12:02:59] <printForever> robertmaxrees, hey buddy
[12:03:14] <robertmaxrees> also, $(document).on('ready' is not the same as $(document).ready() fyi.
[12:03:29] <robertmaxrees> and actually, it looks like you're removing and adding elements, goldbug
[12:05:53] <printForever> robertmaxrees, can you help me out?
[12:06:12] <NoiseEee> printForever: ask your question to the channel
[12:06:17] <Guest55338> ^^
[12:06:23] <printForever> I asked
[12:06:24] <goldbug> robertmaxrees: Have updated the gist with a JavaScript version.
[12:06:25] <printForever> no one replied
[12:06:33] <Guest55338> goldbug make a fiddle instead.
[12:06:53] <printForever> I have a problem with a SELECT > OPTION dropdown list. When you reach the end of the list (when scrolling) I want to continue scrolling the page itself. Can I somehow determine when the dropdown is scrolled all the way to the bottom, and then put focus on BODY element so it would continue to scroll to the end of the entire page? Problem is, I don't know how to determine the scroll position
[12:06:53] <printForever> inside the dropdown. Can anyone please asssit? I've been trying to find a solution online, I tried making something of my own... Does not work...
[12:07:22] <printForever> maybe trying to select last option element? something like scrollBottom($("select").find("option:last-child") but there isn't scrollBottom in jQuery, only scrollTop
[12:08:42] <robertmaxrees> aaand freenode is freaking out today
[12:09:15] <jphase> printForever: you use math with top scrolling positions (subtracting the window scrollTop from the element's scrollTop for example) to calculate things like that. As for selecting the last option in a select, don't use .find, just use the selector itself (if you even need to)
[12:09:55] <robertmaxrees> goldbug did you see my question above about whether or not you're adding/removing elements?
[12:11:33] <goldbug> robertmaxrees: Yes. And yes, that's what I'm doing*. Removing the _name_fields partial and re-rendering it in place. (* Note: I think. I'm a bit new at this.)
[12:11:46] <robertmaxrees> that's what's causing your headaches, then.
[12:11:55] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a delegated listener instead.
[12:12:24] <goldbug> Can you elaborate? What is causing the problem?
[12:12:26] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:12:36] <robertmaxrees> when you remove the element, you lose the event binding.
[12:13:39] <goldbug> Even though I am re-rendering the element?
[12:13:48] <robertmaxrees> yes.  the original element still disappears.
[12:13:58] <robertmaxrees> once you remove that, you lose your reference.
[12:14:08] <goldbug> Ahh. Hmm.
[12:14:14] <robertmaxrees> read that link i shared.
[12:14:32] <printForever> jphase, can you give me an example please?
[12:15:23] <printForever> and is it possible to switch focus from one element to another?
[12:16:08] <jphase> printForever: .focus()
[12:16:14] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+switch+focus
[12:16:27] <jphase> as for an example, the description of what you're trying to do isn't clear enough for me to provide you an example
[12:16:31] <printForever> thanks jphase, I meant a scroll math example
[12:16:55] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I've found it, but I dont know where to switch. To body or window or html?
[12:17:06] <printForever> jpahse, I will create a fiddle
[12:17:12] <robertmaxrees> printForever i'm not sure what you're asking.  fiddles are awesome :)
[12:17:24] <jphase> I don't know what you're trying to calculate, but you can just bind to the window scroll event and subtract the window's current scroll position from the top position of element you're trying to check if they're scrolled passed
[12:17:43] <printForever> jphase! Thats exactly what I'm trying to do!
[12:17:51] <jphase> to determine they've gone passed that element
[12:17:58] <printForever> you just described in a lot less words :)
[12:18:19] <jphase> yeah, so start with the window scroll event
[12:18:27] <jphase> and create a fiddle if you want help
[12:18:37] <printForever> I'm creating the fiddle right now
[12:19:29] <jphase> ooOOooo fiddle changed their UI somewhat recently! :o
[12:19:40] <jphase> it's all codepen'y
[12:19:43] <shoky> some big what
[12:20:57] <jphase> weird, so do you have to include your own jquery script tag now? looks like it :\
[12:21:02] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:21:08] <jphase> oh, I'm missing something then
[12:21:10] <robertmaxrees> click the cog on the javascript wndow.
[12:21:16] <jphase> ahhh thank you!
[12:21:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:21:33] <jphase> sexy pants!!! they did a good job
[12:23:39] <goldbug> robertmaxrees: So to be clear, I need to be listening to an element that has loaded at the beginning (so something in my containing div rather than in the partial that gets reloaded). That's doable, except I already have one of these delegations in the listener already (return $('#language_link').on('click', 'a', language_link);)
[12:24:07] <robertmaxrees> is that element something that gets removed as well?
[12:24:35] <goldbug> #language_link is, yes.
[12:24:42] <robertmaxrees> then you need to go higher up.
[12:24:51] <robertmaxrees> the element you bind to can't get removed ever
[12:25:19] <goldbug> Okay - so how do I do that, syntactically?
[12:25:48] <robertmaxrees> $('someStaticParent').on('click', '#language_link a', language_link);
[12:26:34] <robertmaxrees> exactly the way you're doing it now, just bind further up the tree.
[12:26:40] <robertmaxrees> to whatever parent element doesn't get replaced.
[12:27:22] <printForever> robertmaxrees, jphase http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/1/
[12:27:27] <goldbug> Ah, easy as that eh? Thanks, I'll give that a go (:
[12:28:11] <goldbug> Awesome - works perfectly (;
[12:31:11] <robertmaxrees> printForever so what are you trying to do here?
[12:31:15] <shoky> printForever: are you using select2 or not?  cause with regular selects the browser already makes sure the selected option is visible..
[12:31:27] <shoky> and if using a plugin, the plugin should do that :\
[12:31:46] <printForever> robertmaxrees, so you see that the page is much longer than the viewport, right?
[12:32:01] <printForever> well, I want to continue scrolling the page, after I've scrolled through the dropdown.
[12:32:08] <shoky> oh
[12:32:13] <shoky> why
[12:32:15] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:32:18] <printForever> shoky, hey man! Thanks for droping in! :)
[12:32:22] <shoky> hey ;]
[12:32:28] <robertmaxrees> that's... really confusing.
[12:32:29] <printForever> well, users want it that way :(
[12:32:35] <printForever> generally its not
[12:32:39] <printForever> its logical
[12:32:46] <shoky> users don't know what they want :\
[12:32:50] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:32:50] <printForever> you finish scrolling through one element, and you continue the flow
[12:32:54] <robertmaxrees> why do they want that?
[12:32:59] <printForever> shoky, I AGREE WITH YOU MY MAN!
[12:33:12] <printForever> I have only that condition to turn over my work
[12:33:29] <printForever> so I'm left with only that one little "issue" I can't fix on my own
[12:33:32] <robertmaxrees> that's terribly confusing UX.
[12:33:38] <printForever> agreed
[12:33:45] <robertmaxrees> so tell them they need to trust you.
[12:33:52] <printForever> lol
[12:33:54] <robertmaxrees> why did they hire you otherwise?
[12:34:01] <printForever> tried that 4x
[12:34:08] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:34:16] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[12:34:20] <printForever> yeah... imagine my surprise...
[12:34:26] <printForever> when I tell them that the browser is doing that
[12:34:31] <printForever> that normally you cant do that
[12:34:35] <robertmaxrees> that's what end users expect.
[12:34:38] <printForever> that there is no way it can be done...
[12:34:42] <robertmaxrees> changing their expectations is always a bad idea.
[12:34:43] <printForever> that too!
[12:34:52] <printForever> but... nope nope nope
[12:34:58] <printForever> we want it to continue scrolling
[12:35:08] <robertmaxrees> okay, so what have you tried?
[12:35:25] <printForever> I tried scrollTop
[12:35:27] <robertmaxrees> also, you include jquery through the cog icon in the javascript field.
[12:35:42] <robertmaxrees> and "i tried scrolltop" means nothing - show me code ;)
[12:35:48] <printForever> :/ my fiddle isn't working very well
[12:36:23] <printForever> my code looks idiotic... :(
[12:36:34] <robertmaxrees> the point of this channel is to help you learn.
[12:36:41] <printForever> right
[12:36:56] <printForever> btw. why is my fiddle not working? :/
[12:37:05] <robertmaxrees> "not working" is ephemeral.
[12:37:09] <robertmaxrees> it's unemployed?
[12:37:19] <printForever> select 2 is not loading
[12:37:22] <robertmaxrees> (open your console)
[12:37:24] <printForever> but I've included all files
[12:37:35] <shoky> you're including jquery after select2
[12:37:40] <robertmaxrees> (load jquery through the cog instead of in external resources - otherwise it doesn't load first)
[12:38:17] <printForever> still nothing
[12:38:25] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/4/
[12:38:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/5/
[12:38:29] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:38:42] <robertmaxrees> that's loading for me.
[12:38:51] <printForever> I used 1.11.0
[12:38:56] <robertmaxrees> same diff.
[12:39:46] <printForever> ok, I'll add my code
[12:39:54] <printForever> but... trust me its idiotic
[12:40:05] <robertmaxrees> the point is to help you learn, duder.
[12:40:08] <robertmaxrees> this is how you learn.
[12:41:56] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/6/
[12:42:37] <printForever> so when #demotest is focused I will check if it reaches the bottom of the select
[12:42:45] <taplar> double select lookups
[12:42:48] <robertmaxrees> do you see the problem with that logic?
[12:42:56] <printForever> I suck?
[12:42:58] <robertmaxrees> $('#demotest').focus(function() { only runs when that element gains focus.
[12:43:15] <robertmaxrees> add a console.log in there and see if that fires.
[12:43:16] <printForever> I thought it will only run if IF condition is meet
[12:43:31] <printForever> I understand now
[12:43:37] <printForever> so I need IF outside?
[12:43:40] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:43:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm pointing out that only runs when the element gets focus.
[12:43:48] <robertmaxrees> not as you scroll
[12:43:52] <printForever> oh
[12:43:56] <robertmaxrees> and that's probably not the right element in the first place.
[12:44:03] <taplar> y is it outside the ready?
[12:44:07] * printForever facepalm myself
[12:44:15] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time taplar :)
[12:44:22] <taplar> :)
[12:44:35] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/7/ printForever
[12:44:41] <robertmaxrees> notice how that console.log never runs?
[12:44:49] <printForever> well... the idea behind why it's outside is that Select2 needs to be initialized first, no need in checkinf if its focused
[12:45:10] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I see it
[12:45:13] <robertmaxrees> you'd need that whole blcok in the ready.
[12:45:20] <shoky> select2 uses a totally separate element for your options, btw
[12:45:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't see that console log.
[12:45:43] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I see that there is nothing in console log.
[12:45:49] <robertmaxrees> right - okay.
[12:46:08] <robertmaxrees> so why do you think that is?
[12:46:37] <robertmaxrees> (protip: you don't even care about the focus event in the first place)
[12:46:40] <printForever> because I'm not focusing that element.
[12:46:45] <printForever> I'm focusing "select2-demotest-container"/
[12:46:57] <robertmaxrees> sure, but you don't care about the focus :)
[12:47:15] <printForever> ok, I'm interested in scroll position of the dropdown
[12:47:30] <robertmaxrees> right.  so you care about the scroll event, right?
[12:47:54] <printForever> Like it was my child.
[12:48:04] <taplar> what's up with you shoky.  when did you get an apple?
[12:48:13] <shoky> oh whoops
[12:48:16] <taplar> :D
[12:48:25] <robertmaxrees> sooo bind a listener for that to the right element
[12:48:27] <shoky> there was some dude earlier :@
[12:48:29] <Uhkis> when he banned someone whining about bans
[12:48:34] <taplar> ah
[12:48:36] <taplar> lmao
[12:48:41] <robertmaxrees> hahaha srs?
[12:48:55] <printForever> "sooo bind a listener for that to the right element"??? *____*
[12:48:56] <shoky> well, he also had a very insulting nick
[12:49:03] <shoky> and said insulting things ;)
[12:49:12] <robertmaxrees> printForever what about that is confusing?
[12:49:18] <robertmaxrees> you know how to bind an event listener.
[12:49:27] <printForever> well, what listener? focus? onclick? scroll?
[12:49:37] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:49:44] <printForever> Yes! (no idea actually)
[12:49:44] <robertmaxrees> what event have we been talkign about?
[12:49:50] <printForever> scroll
[12:50:09] <printForever> but isn't that just for moving through the page?
[12:50:32] <robertmaxrees> you have an element with a scrollbar that you can scroll through.
[12:51:12] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/10/
[12:51:37] <robertmaxrees> you know how to verify this - use a console log or something to test.
[12:51:39] <printForever> sorry, wrong selector http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/11/
[12:52:04] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/12/
[12:52:34] <printForever> There is nothing in console log, and I've selected the element that is being scrolled.
[12:53:12] <inthl> having a link, e.g. <a href... onclick="return confirm('foobar'):"> triggers a confirmation to click on. my issue is now that, no matter what one selects, it also triggers a later $(thatlink).click() ... - no matter what one has pressed. is there some way to have a check for this in the listener not to proceed unless "OK" was clicked?
[12:53:27] <robertmaxrees> printForever right, that is not the correct selector.
[12:53:47] <printForever> robertmaxrees, what would be a proper selector?
[12:54:43] <taplar> inthl: that's kinda hokey.  your doing a confirmation on a link, of which a confirmation typically wants to proceed immediately
[12:55:04] <ExtraSteve> Is there a way I can create a CSS class in jquery which I can then use later with addClass?
[12:55:09] <robertmaxrees> printForever we're going to go back and forth on this for a while.
[12:55:09] <taplar> you'd have to do something like return false and then logically go to the url when they click ok
[12:55:16] <inthl> yes, but the second button in there is "Cancel", so I do not want it to continue in the event listener
[12:55:18] <robertmaxrees> i gotta focus on this meeting.  sorry.
[12:55:38] <inthl> this is basically an ajax call in the click listener. but with that confirmation before
[12:55:54] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I'm just asking for some idea on how to determine when the scroll is at the bottom of the list. Can you please help? Write a line...
[12:55:54] <inthl> whereas I think that is the answer: build that confirmation into the listener..?
[12:56:18] <taplar> ok, so with the way you have it now with the inline call, you'd have to return false to stop that link action, and then proceed if they click ok
[12:56:18] <robertmaxrees> bind higher up - it looks like select2 dynamically creates that UL.
[12:56:30] <shoky> inthl: don't use onclick attributes, bind the events in your js code, e.g. with jquery's .click(function(e) { if (!confirm('foo')) { e.preventDefault() }
[12:56:33] <taplar> either way, fwiw it is preferred to do your binding in your javascript
[12:56:44] <printForever> if I bind higher up, will that mean I wont be able to select it?
[12:56:47] <robertmaxrees> printForever if the scroll handler still doesn't fire, i'll guess that select2 is prevent that event from bubbling.
[12:56:50] <inthl> shoky, yes, just answered that to myself :> thanks for the hints
[12:57:05] <robertmaxrees> you can still select it, you just can't bind to it since it doesn't exist yet.
[12:57:13] <printForever> robertmaxrees I'm going up up up
[12:57:27] <printForever> still nothing
[12:57:34] <robertmaxrees> printForever and if it doesn't work, you're SOL
[12:57:40] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[12:57:57] <shoky> printForever you tried delegating? in your fiddle you're not
[12:58:14] <shoky> .select-results doesn't exist when you're binding to it
[12:58:16] <taplar> ExtraSteve: is there a reason you can't make the class already in your css?
[12:58:39] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I went all the way up, to its first parent, and still nothing.
[12:58:51] <robertmaxrees> printForever listen to shoky ;)
[12:58:53] <printForever> shoky, how do I fix that? ajaxCompleted?
[12:59:04] <printForever> thank you robertmaxrees!!! I will.
[12:59:04] <shoky> printForever: lol? what does ajax have to do with this
[12:59:08] <robertmaxrees> wtf where did you get ajaxcompleted out of delegation?
[12:59:19] <printForever> guys... I'm asking... :( sorry
[12:59:32] <printForever> I know about ajaxCompleted, I don't know about delegation.
[12:59:41] <printForever> Is delegation same as callback?
[12:59:51] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-listeners
[12:59:53] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[13:00:01] <ExtraSteve> taplar: may be the class needs to be created dynamically - based upon some ajax data that may be changing
[13:00:13] <printForever> so I should use
[13:00:13] <shoky> printForever: you do event delegation by binding the event on an element higher up the DOM (highest is document), with a selector argument that says which elements you're delegating for.
[13:00:20] <printForever> .on(focus)
[13:00:20] <taplar> what's the use case?
[13:00:44] <shoky> printForever: but it doesn't seem to be working with select2:  http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/16/
[13:00:48] <robertmaxrees> printForever you didn't actually read anything.  you skipped to the first example.
[13:00:53] <taplar> :)
[13:00:54] <printForever> sorry
[13:00:58] <printForever> I've meant scroll
[13:01:04] <printForever> its overwhelming
[13:01:14] <ExtraSteve> taplar: depending on who is logged into a system, the data they post will be in their own CSS preferences. I don't want to load every user's CSS when not every user is logged in
[13:01:28] <robertmaxrees> but like shoky just noted, there's a chance that event might not be firing.
[13:01:38] <taplar> aaaah
[13:01:49] <printForever> shoky, is there Select 2 callback or somethng?
[13:01:51] <taplar> so you conditionally want to load css stylesheets
[13:02:06] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=select2+scroll+event printForever
[13:02:16] <shoky> printForever: i checked a bit the select2 docs and they dont have any docs for their events yet :\
[13:02:19] <shoky> so no idea
[13:02:25] <ExtraSteve> So if they want their font color to be orange and background to be pink (ew), I'll just pull those two bits of data out of the ajax call and somehow register those classes
[13:02:29] <printForever> shoky http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18615108/trigger-an-action-after-selection-select2
[13:02:41] <shoky> printForever: that's to trigger after a selection
[13:02:50] <printForever> :(
[13:02:55] <ExtraSteve> And then do an addClass('style_'+username);
[13:03:20] <taplar> are these stylesheets the users are dynamically able to edit some how?
[13:03:35] <ExtraSteve> Yeah
[13:03:37] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:03:39] <ExtraSteve> So it may change
[13:03:45] <printForever> robertmaxrees, does this help?http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28766016/select2-onchange-event-cancels-my-scrolltop-command-in-firefox
[13:03:49] <shoky> printForever: found something here https://select2.github.io/examples.html#events  but nothing abotu scrolling
[13:03:56] <robertmaxrees> lol printForever i dunno does it?
[13:04:04] <ExtraSteve> I suppose I could just append some <style>'s
[13:04:10] <printForever> sorry I wanted to say shoky... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28766016/select2-onchange-event-cancels-my-scrolltop-command-in-firefox
[13:04:17] <taplar> meaning they can edit the css themselves to create their own rules.  not just selecting options for their rules some how
[13:04:19] <robertmaxrees> ExtraSteve how many different styles are there?
[13:04:21] <ExtraSteve> But it just seems like there should be a better way
[13:04:26] <ExtraSteve> robertmaxrees: potentially infinite
[13:04:34] <robertmaxrees> like, you're not just giving users inputs to enter whatever they want, right?
[13:04:41] <ExtraSteve> Correct
[13:04:54] <taplar> so their choices are finite
[13:05:02] <shoky> printForever not really
[13:05:03] <ExtraSteve> But they can choose a background color from a set, a font color from a set, style attributes (bold, italic, etc)
[13:05:10] <taplar> that's fine
[13:05:10] <robertmaxrees> right, so define all those.
[13:05:13] <ExtraSteve> So yes, it is finiite
[13:05:27] <taplar> so there really isn't a reason to have user specific classes
[13:05:29] <robertmaxrees> so then your backend adds classes to things as appropriate and then you have one stylesheet.
[13:05:35] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ what taplar said.
[13:06:07] <printForever> shoky, so how can I even then start to determine the last option element in select so I would determine it has reach the bottom of the scroll and switch focus to body? :(
[13:06:41] <ExtraSteve> I suppose, it just seems like a bit of a waste to have every combination of font/bg in a style sheet if only a handful are actually being used...
[13:06:45] <robertmaxrees> print if you can hook into the scroll event, you don't.  you're SOL.
[13:06:51] <taplar> you don't
[13:06:56] <taplar> you have them on the low level
[13:07:04] <taplar> an element can have multiple classes
[13:07:14] <robertmaxrees> ExtraSteve you just have classes - .bg-color-red .font-color-green
[13:07:15] <robertmaxrees> etc
[13:07:23] <taplar> and others for your fonts
[13:07:35] <ExtraSteve> That's what I was going to do
[13:07:41] <ExtraSteve> But... here's where it gets stupider
[13:07:56] <ExtraSteve> I also need to be able to remove those without necessarily knowing which classes are there
[13:08:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:08:04] <ExtraSteve> So I need to be able to remove bg-*
[13:08:08] <ExtraSteve> and font-color*
[13:08:12] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:08:24] <robertmaxrees> and that's actually pretty easy.
[13:08:25] <shoky> printForever: there could be a hacky way to do it but.... this is really something you'd be better off just NOT doing, because it's stupid :)
[13:08:26] <ExtraSteve> To show that the user is no longer working on an item
[13:08:36] <robertmaxrees> ExtraSteve then yeah, you can do that.
[13:08:37] <ExtraSteve> WHen they work on an item, it changes to their colors
[13:08:42] <ExtraSteve> When they're done, it goes back to normal
[13:08:47] <printForever> shoky, its teh last last last thing on my list and they wont accept it without it...
[13:08:59] <taplar> heh, sounds like a workflow app
[13:09:02] <ExtraSteve> robertmaxrees: can I do wildcards with class names?
[13:09:07] <ExtraSteve> taplar: yep :)
[13:09:33] <robertmaxrees> ExtraSteve you can get the .prop('class').split(' '); for something and get an array of names.
[13:09:35] <taplar> you wouldn't happen to work for a retail chain would you?
[13:09:46] <ExtraSteve> taplar: lol, no
[13:09:51] <taplar> dang
[13:10:07] <taplar> we have one of those in the works in my shop.  was wondering if one of those guys might have popped in here, lol
[13:10:13] <taplar> i was going to go yell over the wall
[13:10:19] <ExtraSteve> :p
[13:10:36] <ExtraSteve> If you're really interested, I can explain the nature of the app
[13:10:43] <ExtraSteve> But I think you get the gist of it
[13:10:49] <taplar> i'm good, :)
[13:11:01] <shoky> printForever: some progress ;)  http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/18/
[13:11:01] <ExtraSteve> Well, I'll take what I've learned here and figure something out
[13:11:04] <ExtraSteve> Thank you guys :)
[13:11:11] <printForever> shoky I LOVE YOU
[13:11:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:11:24] <robertmaxrees> this is going to be goo.
[13:11:25] <shoky> ;D
[13:11:27] * robertmaxrees grabs some popcorn
[13:11:39] <printForever> I wanted to say LIKE YOU
[13:11:43] <printForever> not love... pfff....
[13:11:45] <taplar> too late
[13:11:47] <shoky> oh :(
[13:11:49] <taplar> freudian
[13:12:03] <taplar> can anyone in here officiate?
[13:12:12] <robertmaxrees> i've got my license.
[13:12:18] <taplar> boom
[13:13:20] <printForever> so its checking the whole document for when mousewheel is used on select2-results ul
[13:13:36] <robertmaxrees> printForever that's called event delegation.
[13:13:51] <printForever> thats called robertmaxrees said it wasn't possible but shoky did it!
[13:13:52] <robertmaxrees> if you read the link i posted earlier you'd know what that's doing ;)
[13:13:53] <printForever> :)
[13:13:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:13:59] <printForever> yes you did
[13:14:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i said at all.
[13:14:04] <printForever> you've said it twice
[13:14:06] <robertmaxrees> for the scroll event.
[13:14:07] <printForever> and shoky did it
[13:14:10] * jphase is ordained through the reputable Universal Ministries online :)
[13:14:24] <robertmaxrees> shoky bound to the mousewheel event - one that i admittedly forgot about.
[13:14:37] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs mang.  sorry for trying to help.
[13:14:45] <printForever> shoky is the man! or lady or whatever he wants to be!
[13:15:04] <taplar> what, is shoky like Pat?
[13:15:09] <printForever> no, no, just kidding robertmaxrees :)
[13:15:27] <jphase> a little late for that - he already rage quit because you hurt his feelings :\
[13:15:29] <jphase> hehe
[13:15:35] <printForever> oh no
[13:16:05] <printForever> shoky, can we use scrollTop to determine the height of the dropdown?
[13:16:09] <jphase> see what happens when you express your <3 for only 1 helper. #AllHelpersMatter
[13:16:10] <jphase> lol
[13:16:25] <taplar> nah, you can leave me out of that luv
[13:16:26] <printForever> #PrayForRobertMaxRees
[13:16:40] <jphase> printForever: .height()
[13:17:05] <printForever> jphase, we're trying to see when the scroll bar reaches the bottom
[13:17:12] <printForever> and then switch focus to body
[13:17:18] <printForever> so it would continue to scroll the page
[13:17:57] <printForever> Height would just get the size of the viewport (that contains the list of elements).
[13:18:18] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/19/
[13:18:26] <jphase> printForever: innerHeight
[13:18:53] <jphase> if ( ( window.innerHeight + window.scrollY ) >= document.body.offsetHeight ) { // focus stuff }
[13:19:08] <shoky> but focusing body doesn't really help, cursor is still not over body
[13:19:35] <printForever> shoky, oh crap
[13:19:43] <printForever> hm...
[13:19:43] <shoky> even if focusing did work.. why would you want to focus? what if they then scroll up?
[13:20:00] <printForever> they will scroll up
[13:20:06] <shoky> but focus is on body
[13:20:10] <printForever> yes
[13:20:13] <printForever> they will work hte page
[13:20:16] <shoky> it'll scroll body even though they want to scroll the dropdown
[13:20:19] <printForever> *the page, not the dropdown
[13:20:22] <shoky> yes, very bad
[13:20:26] <taplar> lol, conversely if they scroll up to the top of the page do you want to focus back on the select, heh
[13:20:27] <printForever> no, its perfect
[13:20:34] <shoky> it's perfect crap
[13:20:57] <printForever> if they scroll to top of the page... great idea taplar!
[13:21:02] <taplar> nooooooo!
[13:21:05] <shoky> printForever: just think... i am scrollnig through the dropdown, i scroll down and happen to reach the bottom,  then i want to scroll back up to seee porevious results...
[13:21:07] <printForever> or not...
[13:21:21] <shoky> but it'll scroll the body instead of the results
[13:21:21] <taplar> heh, idc really
[13:21:30] <printForever> shoky, I understand that
[13:21:41] <printForever> and that "flawed design" is what I need
[13:21:52] <shoky> i'm positive it's NOT what you need
[13:22:12] <printForever> trust me on this one, it really is
[13:22:21] <shoky> k. good luck ;p
[13:22:27] <printForever> :(
[13:22:36] <printForever> can you please help me out
[13:22:39] <shoky> ...
[13:23:06] <printForever> I don't know how to setup the focus switch when it reaches bottom
[13:23:18] <shoky> $('body').focus();
[13:23:22] <shoky> but as i said, that doesn't help.
[13:23:28] <printForever> they want it to work like here
[13:23:29] <printForever> http://www.jobs.cz/
[13:23:41] <printForever> but this is a plain HTML made to look like dropdown
[13:24:04] <shoky> that's not scrolling the body back up if i reach the bottom of dropdown and then scroll up
[13:25:17] <printForever> I guess that on jobs.cz it continues to move because its plain html
[13:25:25] <printForever> div > ul > li
[13:25:32] <taplar> can't really see it as my place blocks the site.  but it sounds like they are doing more of a dialog or something instead of a select?
[13:25:48] <shoky> no they're doing pretty much what he asked for
[13:25:55] <taplar> hmm
[13:27:23] <shoky> not sure if they're doing it via code, or just their DOM/css is set up nicer so it just works
[13:27:56] <printForever> :/
[13:31:01] <printForever> shoky, could it be that Select 2 is binding the mouse pointer to its dropdown list
[13:31:32] <shoky> printForever the browser does that when you move your mouse over it, sort of..
[13:32:54] <printForever> I believe this is the answer shoky https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/3287
[13:33:23] <printForever> I used selec2.full.js in the fiddle
[13:34:06] <shoky> you believe that's the answer?
[13:34:09] <printForever> replaced http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/21/
[13:34:34] <printForever> IT IS
[13:34:36] <printForever> IT IS
[13:34:39] <shoky> o
[13:34:48] <shoky> nice :)
[13:35:30] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/24/
[13:35:52] <printForever> omg
[13:35:59] <shoky> what did you chaneg now?>
[13:36:11] <printForever> I've added more paragraphs
[13:36:16] <printForever> to check if it will scroll
[13:36:25] <shoky> btw you dont need all that code
[13:36:26] <printForever> and I replaced full with regular select2
[13:36:35] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/25/
[13:36:56] <shoky> it was just that plugin interfering or something
[13:37:15] <printForever> it loaded mousewheel...

[14:07:29] <nowhereFast> I am doing $('#el').remove(); -this works in firefox and chrome but in safari only if the page is in focus
[14:08:03] <nowhereFast> if I am on a different tab and switch back after the event takes place the element is still on the page and has not been removed
[14:08:26] <nowhereFast> does anybody know why this is happening or how I can get it sorted?
[14:08:45] <robertmaxrees> that's interesting.
[14:08:49] <robertmaxrees> what version of safari?
[14:09:08] <nowhereFast> Version 9.0.1 (10601.2.7.2)
[14:09:10] <robertmaxrees> and can you trigger the bug in something like jsfiddle?  use a timeout, swap to a different tab, wait, and switch back?
[14:09:13] <nowhereFast> to be exact :-)
[14:10:23] <nowhereFast> I could try, the way it currently works is that the element has a timer in it ticking down, when it gets to zero it calls a function that should remove it
[14:10:46] <robertmaxrees> either/or.  having something that can replicate it outside of your page is usually helpful.
[14:10:49] <nowhereFast> works great when in view, but not when elsewhere
[14:11:43] <nowhereFast> okay, I'll put something together for it, might be one of the other libs I am using
[14:12:05] <nowhereFast> figured id check in here first just incase it is a jquery qirk and someone has come across it before
[14:12:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd check the bugtracker for that.

[14:19:49] <sigdk> Hello, can someone help me with this: https://jsfiddle.net/rzym5beu/2/ ?
[14:20:08] <robertmaxrees> sigdk what's your question?
[14:20:11] <sigdk> A modal is supposed o appear and a message when clicking somewhere in the window
[14:20:15] <sigdk> but it doesnt
[14:20:22] <robertmaxrees> sure - you're not including jquery
[14:20:36] <robertmaxrees> click that little cog icon next to "javascript" in that pane - include jquery
[14:20:42] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, that's a good point...
[14:20:59] <sigdk> btw did this site change or is it my impression ? why don't I see the option at top left ?
[14:21:07] <robertmaxrees> they did a redesign.
[14:21:11] <robertmaxrees> moved some things around.
[14:21:12] <markh> launched yesterday i believe
[14:21:49] <robertmaxrees> also don't put script tags in the html area.
[14:22:45] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, how do I call the .leanModall()
[14:22:46] <sigdk> ?
[14:23:25] <robertmaxrees> you're doing that in the javascript area.  but you don't haveany html soooo
[14:23:29] <sigdk> ok, this is a new version: https://jsfiddle.net/rzym5beu/5/
[14:23:50] <robertmaxrees> also it looks like you're calling the plugin twice.
[14:24:03] <markh> you don't have any html tags with the id of "registerusertrigger", so nothing will happen
[14:24:13] <markh> well nothing would happen anyway
[14:24:15] <markh> but yeah
[14:24:42] <robertmaxrees> also, you can't technically use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ to load things in jsfiddle - it won't work in chrome.  use https://rawgit.com/
[14:25:03] <robertmaxrees> and load jquery through jsfiddle - no need to link it in separately.
[14:25:36] <robertmaxrees> like https://jsfiddle.net/rzym5beu/7/ - click the cog icon next to the javascript box heading.  you can add it through there.
[14:27:20] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, ok... seems to be already there
[14:27:32] <sigdk> (at https://jsfiddle.net/rzym5beu/7/)
[14:29:10] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, so... any hint ? what is missing there to see the leanmodal ?
[14:29:48] <markh> https://jsfiddle.net/rzym5beu/9/
[14:32:04] <sigdk> markh, what's that ?
[14:32:58] <robertmaxrees> where's the html?
[14:39:06] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, hold, I'll simplify the one I have
[14:50:18] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/rzym5beu/10/  actually the modal is shown, the message on close is not
[14:55:19] <markh> the console.log?
[15:21:22] <BustyLoli-Chan> I have page that literally outputs "true" or "false"
[15:21:54] <BustyLoli-Chan> I'm using a getJSON call to try to get a data object which I'm assuming to be this "true" or "false"
[15:22:15] <BustyLoli-Chan> but instead all I'm getting is an object Object
[15:22:30] <BustyLoli-Chan> can someone please tell me how to parse the "true" or "false" as a boolean?
[15:23:23] <NoiseEee> BustyLoli-Chan: console.log the object and see what it really is / how to access what you want from it
[15:23:34] <BustyLoli-Chan> how do I console.log it?
[15:25:08] <BustyLoli-Chan> Okay, I googled that and did it and I get [true]
[15:25:11] <BustyLoli-Chan> on the command line
[15:26:28] <NoiseEee> BustyLoli-Chan: pastebin some code
[15:27:51] <BustyLoli-Chan> http://pastebin.com/zByrdfd8
[15:29:30] <NoiseEee> BustyLoli-Chan: so where are you getting "but instead all I'm getting is an object Object"
[15:30:11] <BustyLoli-Chan> I was trying to use an alert
[15:30:22] <BustyLoli-Chan> http://pastebin.com/DSdj9m5N this actually seems to work fine for my purposes
[15:30:30] <poseidon> I have <div class="something" data-id="1"> <div> ...... </div> </div>  How do I get just the <div class="something" data-id="1"> </div>?
[15:30:31] <NoiseEee> great!
[15:31:50] <NoiseEee> poseidon: $('div [data-id=1]')
[15:32:25] <NoiseEee> poseidon: i don't know what you mean by "just" though... without its contents?
[15:32:40] <realchriswells> hi guys
[15:34:01] <realchriswells> I'm having some serious bother trying to get an ajax function to work - I need it to poll a page to get the latest html for a table and replace the exisitng one on the page every 10 seconds
[15:35:44] <realchriswells> so far I have this: http://kopy.io/K11vM
[15:39:33] <realchriswells> ok, I've updated it now http://jsfiddle.net/euLz2u4e/
[15:39:52] <realchriswells> but I need to take the response (which is html table) and replace the existing one
[15:44:56] <claytonzaugg> From the dev tools console, how can I trigger the a:hover affect on an element without actually hovering over it?
[15:46:39] <claytonzaugg> Nevermind, found my answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4515124/see-hover-state-in-chrome-developer-tools
[15:48:34] <poseidon> NoiseEee: I mean I want to get that actual string.
[15:49:00] <poseidon> I want to put `<div class="something" data-id="1"> </div>` into a textarea without any child elements
[15:49:34] <NoiseEee> hmm
[15:49:42] <blakespot> re:
[15:50:56] <blakespot> I load up a js object with data and in-browser render that out to the page, and there are filter controls on the page allowing user to filter the data. Becuase if the dynamic rendering, Accordion can't expand / contract the rendered divs for me, as it's appearing and disappearing from page after initial load.
[15:50:57] <NoiseEee> uh does the "new" jsfiddle not have libs ready to go?
[15:51:30] <blakespot> I need a system that can with a click expand or collapse one of a series of divs (more info in a store type scenario) that works with dynamic page data.
[15:51:39] <blakespot> Does anyone know of a codeset that will do this?
[15:52:33] <lukeasrodgers> poseidon, try: n.cloneNode().outerHTML
[15:52:37] <lukeasrodgers> where n is the dom node
[15:52:44] <lukeasrodgers> (doesn't need jquery)
[15:52:53] <lukeasrodgers> (may not work on all browsers — YMMV)
[15:53:13] <realchriswells> rookie question: I've got a file being loaded with a function, but calling a script in that file at the bottom of the page doesn't work
[15:53:23] <realchriswells> if I call it in the Code Inspector, everything works fine
[15:53:32] <realchriswells> it's just not triggering initially
[15:53:39] <poseidon> I guess when I do $('#something').empty(); it destorys the element itself, not just everything inside it?
[15:54:13] <poseidon> because $('#something').empty();  $('#something').html(); gives me nothing
[15:54:39] <poseidon> It seems like there would be an easy way to just get rid of everyting inside the div, but not the div itself
[15:54:53] <lukeasrodgers> .html() returns the contents of the div, not the div itself
[15:54:59] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/1cgembyn/ @ poseidon
[15:55:18] <lukeasrodgers> try $("#something").empty(); $('#something').get(0)
[15:55:33] <lukeasrodgers> that will give you the dom node
[15:55:39] <poseidon> NoiseEee: exactly what I'm looking for, thanks!
[15:56:00] <lukeasrodgers> no prob. if you needit as a string, see my previous answer
[16:52:23] <checkit> Hey all... I'm using Moment.js to work w/ some calendar stuff but I'm having trouble outputing the $moment object less the timezone offset... Anyone here have experience w/ this library?
[16:52:43] <robertmaxrees> just ask your questions - if somebody can help, they will :)
[16:54:32] <checkit> My moment is "Wed Dec 02 2015 10:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)"; how can I output the "10:00"? $moment.format('HH:mm') less the timezone which is "-08:00".
[16:54:49] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle we can play with?
[16:55:17] <checkit> Been playing in console. I'll set one up.
[16:55:21] <robertmaxrees> thanks.
[17:03:05] <estan> hi folks. i'm using a Sortable and then jQuery Touch Punch to be able to use it from a phone. the problem is that i have links inside my draggable items, and since the dragging starts immediately, it becomes very hard to hit those links.
[17:03:13] <estan> anyone been a similar situation?
[17:03:29] <checkit> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/Lgvappur/2/
[17:03:32] <estan> i mean, it becomes hard because you often accidently start a drag operation, when you meant to hit the link.
[17:03:53] <estan> it would be nice if Sortable had some sort of "resistance" setting.
[17:04:16] <robertmaxrees> estan i haven't, but i'll bet you could see if the originating element for the event were the <a> and then do some preventing magic or something.
[17:04:24] <estan> (or way of excluding certain sub-elements of the draggable item?)
[17:04:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up the docs, either way.
[17:04:43] <estan> robertmaxrees: ah yes. that might be possible. thanks.
[17:05:27] <robertmaxrees> checkit so you want 18:00 GMT?
[17:05:53] <robertmaxrees> checkit because right now that object isn't utc.
[17:07:28] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Essentially, looking for it to output 10:00 (am)
[17:07:46] <robertmaxrees> then set it to 10:00
[17:08:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/Lgvappur/3/ checkit
[17:09:42] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Not that simply sadly... The object is being built based off of input from an external system. We're using moment to manipulate it. So, 18:00 is what it's built off of in this case.
[17:10:06] <robertmaxrees> okay, so what time zone is the object being generated for?
[17:10:07] <robertmaxrees> gmt?
[17:10:57] <checkit> Here is another example with the UTF offset: http://jsfiddle.net/Lgvappur/4/
[17:11:04] <robertmaxrees> UTF offset?
[17:11:08] <robertmaxrees> you mean UTC?
[17:12:01] <checkit> yes. Apologies
[17:12:11] <robertmaxrees> http://momentjs.com/timezone/
[17:12:20] <robertmaxrees> this will probably simplify things.
[17:13:12] <checkit> I'm realizing the same thing.
[17:13:44] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you want var day = moment("18:00", "HH:mm").utc();
[17:13:52] <robertmaxrees> to flag that object as being UTC.
[17:15:56] <checkit> robertmaxrees: It's giving 2:00 am now...
[17:17:28] <robertmaxrees> ah, reading the docs ;)
[17:19:48] <estan> robertmaxrees: doh. there was http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-cancel :P don't know why i didn't see it.
[17:19:57] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you need the timezone addon checkit
[17:20:07] <robertmaxrees> also, you can use your native browser console.
[17:20:45] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Oh I know... Convenient novelty :)... About the TZ, what do you mean there exactly?
[17:20:51] <checkit> NM
[17:20:53] <checkit> I get it.
[17:20:58] <checkit> The other lib...
[17:21:02] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you can just subtract 8 hours.
[17:21:15] <robertmaxrees> but that may or may not be what you really want :)\
[17:21:36] <checkit> right right
[17:21:39] <checkit> thanks robertmaxrees
[17:21:42] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[17:21:53] <robertmaxrees> also, create the object with moment.utc() instead
[17:22:06] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Right. Started doing that as well.
[17:25:40] <jackweb> Hello. I use $.ajax() in my HTTPS website with an url: '/someResource/' and all internet browsers deny the access saying that it uses mixed content (different protocols). Why? I have always thought that using relative address I use the same protocol... How to solve the problem?
[17:26:08] <robertmaxrees> look at your network tab - is the request getting redirected?
[17:27:08] <jackweb> it is canelled
[17:27:12] <jackweb> cancelled
[17:27:25] <jackweb> and the address contains https:// prefix too
[17:27:35] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it's getting redirected.
[17:29:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise something else is causing your headaches.
[17:29:35] <jackweb> but XHR uses protocol of the website, right?
[17:29:45] <robertmaxrees> correct.  your server can then redirect it.
[17:29:58] <robertmaxrees> so the initial request can be good, and then there's a redirect that causes your headache.
[17:31:39] <jackweb> i'll check it
[17:32:48] <checkit> Got it robertmaxrees ... ty again.
[17:33:33] <robertmaxrees> checkit awesome
[17:38:50] <jackweb> robertmaxrees: the initial request is from https, there is no redirection from https -> http in my app
[17:39:01] <robertmaxrees> then something else is going on.
[17:40:27] <robertmaxrees> it this something you can share?
[17:41:37] <jackweb> authentication required, rather it's impossible :( i checked it in Opera, which says about http: (in browser's console)
[17:41:56] <jackweb> as opposite to Chromium
[17:42:01] <robertmaxrees> then there's probably a redirect going on.
[17:43:30] <jackweb> can i force jquery to use https: instead of http or do i have to pass explicitly url in AJAX as 'https://website/...' (full URL)?
[17:43:52] <robertmaxrees> if the current page is https, then you're already doing tht.
[17:43:53] <robertmaxrees> *that.
[17:44:09] <robertmaxrees> something tells me that even if you fully qualify the url, you're going to have the same problem
[17:44:17] <robertmaxrees> becuase it's not a client-side issue, it's a server-side issue.
[17:50:30] <jackweb> robertmaxrees: you are right, it was django related problem: i needed to add SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https') in my settings.py in my server side script :) THANKS
[17:50:37] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[17:51:35] <jackweb> the funniest thing is it worked days ago ;) (without the conf)
[17:52:38] <robertmaxrees> then something changed.
[17:54:23] <jackweb> apparently
[18:02:41] <jackweb> good night
[18:04:36] <dffd22> hi.
[18:04:58] <robertmaxrees> hello
[18:05:47] <dffd22> in my app, i need to keep a globally accessible log of data fetched via async $.getJSON() methods. any suggestions to how best do that?
[18:05:58] <dffd22> s/methods/calls/
[18:06:02] <robertmaxrees> mind if I ask why you're doing that?
[18:07:11] <dffd22> to avoid calling Fetch(arg) twice. If it's been successfully fetched, i need to keep track of that.
[18:07:35] <robertmaxrees> then use promises instead.
[18:08:08] <dffd22> can u point me to a (useful) link for that, especially given my plans :) thanks
[18:08:33] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/promise/
[18:08:50] <dffd22> ok, thanks i am skim-reading.
[18:09:03] <robertmaxrees> you'll want to actually read it.
[18:11:46] <dffd22> ill do that when im less tired :)
[18:13:09] <dffd22> it think i conceptually already have a "promise", because i have a func(arg, callback) { .getJSON(arg) { cb() } );
[18:13:11] <dffd22> pseudo-code
[18:13:19] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:13:20] <dffd22> then i do: func(arg, function() { });
[18:13:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to use an actual promise.
[18:13:31] <robertmaxrees> not "conceptually"
[18:13:53] <dffd22> i am learning i see.
[18:13:57] <dffd22> + ,
[18:14:23] <robertmaxrees> so the idea is you don't use callbacks at all any more.  you use .done()
[18:14:30] <robertmaxrees> how many ajax calls are there?
[18:14:58] <robertmaxrees> and is it like a specific set of them that you only want to fire if the user, say, clicked on something?  or what?
[18:16:41] <dffd22> the user can fetch a record, which is identified by a unique id. the model data is then renderedin a view. i dont want the user to fetch a record when its already "open" / being displayed.
[18:17:33] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want to re-render the entire view?
[18:17:52] <dffd22> no, i want nothing to happen.
[18:18:18] <robertmaxrees> right.  so you need to step back a bit further an make the views themselves promises.
[18:19:26] <otahak> how does one open a new window and override the browser's desire to open a new tab?
[18:19:33] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[18:19:42] <otahak> how do some sites force it then?
[18:19:46] <robertmaxrees> popups.
[18:19:50] <otahak> yeah
[18:19:55] <otahak> how do I popups?
[18:20:02] <robertmaxrees> not full new windows, but it's hard to trigger those without tripping the popup blocker.
[18:20:08] <otahak> even tried event.preventDefault(); with my window.open but no dice
[18:20:15] <dffd22> robertmaxrees, but where/how would you save "current_record_id"?
[18:20:18] <otahak> (it'll be init by user)
[18:20:30] <otahak> (its a login popup)
[18:20:34] <robertmaxrees> dffd22 you should have a single parent view that holds all this info.
[18:21:22] <robertmaxrees> otahak window.open(url,windowName,'height=200,width=150');
[18:21:27] <robertmaxrees> like, that's how you use it.
[18:21:44] <otahak> tried that... chrome refuses to open a popup lol
[18:21:55] <robertmaxrees> how are you triggering it?
[18:22:12] <robertmaxrees> if you're not careful, the browser will think you're doing something you shouldn't be.
[18:22:12] <otahak> click()
[18:22:18] <dffd22> robertmaxrees, thank you for your. i am sure i'll find a solution tomorrow :).
[18:22:18] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[18:22:25] <otahak> kk
[18:22:26] <dffd22> your help.
[18:23:05] <otahak> nvm
[18:23:10] <otahak> Im stupid, is the problem
[18:23:29] <otahak> error 0: user not competent
[18:23:37] <robertmaxrees> what was the issue?
[18:23:43] <otahak> a )
[18:24:07] <otahak> specifically - I had made a change but forgot to place it back on the end of the options :(
[18:25:04] <otahak> window.open('', '_blank'), 'toolbar=0,location=0,menubar=0,width=500,height=300';
[18:25:10] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:25:11] <otahak> lol
[18:25:22] <otahak> I forget to slow down sometimes.
[18:25:39] <robertmaxrees> should also open your developer tools and check your console.
[18:25:52] <otahak> its open
[18:26:25] <otahak> wasnt logging anything tho as technically it had the only required arg
[18:26:35] <robertmaxrees> you should get a syntax error there.
[18:38:46] <robert_> OKAY, so I'm trying to get a two-step website working
[18:39:23] <robert_> you click a search button and a dialog pops up, you look for what you want and click the select button
[18:39:59] <robert_> the page is supposed to then fill in a disabled field and submit the form
[18:42:43] <robert_> problem is, I'm not getting the disabled field in my list of submitted fields
[18:42:52] <robertmaxrees> well i mean...
[18:42:55] <robertmaxrees> it's disabled.
[18:43:32] <robert_> so there's no way to have it so you have to use the search window that pops up?
[18:43:44] <robertmaxrees> are you using ajax?
[18:43:47] <robert_> no
[18:44:04] <robertmaxrees> so what's with the disabled input?
[18:45:00] <arc_> you could duplicate whatever is in there to a hidden input
[18:45:46] <robert_> oh, there we go.
[18:45:55] <robert_> I can simply set readonly
[18:46:00] <robert_> nevermind. :D
[18:46:16] <arc_> internet
[19:06:14] <badDev> Could someone help me with a small CSS issue with a jQuery UI module?
[19:07:07] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, just ask.
[19:07:11] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will :)
[19:08:20] <badDev> I am using the datePicker with a bootstrap modal. Default, the datePicker was shown below the modal. I fixed that by changing the z-index. However, the title attribute for the links (Next, Previous, Sunday-Saturday) are shown behind the modal, and I can't seem to fix that
[19:08:41] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle with your problem?
[19:10:22] <printForever> shoky, are you here?
[19:10:37] <printForever> I'm getting Uncaught Error: undefined missing select2/dropdown/attachContainer from Select 2
[19:10:46] <printForever> I've googled it, but I couldn't find what it is...
[19:10:49] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[19:10:50] <robertmaxrees> printForever
[19:12:19] <printForever> its a resource question robertmaxrees
[19:12:28] <printForever> it has nothing do to with the fiddle
[19:12:38] <robertmaxrees> then clarify your question.
[19:12:39] <printForever> when you're using select2.full.js
[19:12:41] <robertmaxrees> no need to be rude.
[19:12:44] <printForever> you have EVERYTHING inside
[19:12:58] <printForever> but when you use just select2.js then there are stuff missing
[19:13:00] <printForever> :/
[19:13:09] <printForever> I don't know how to include thos missing things
[19:13:15] <printForever> *those
[19:13:33] <printForever> I copied their entire folder, and still nothing
[19:13:49] <robertmaxrees> did you include the script tags?  and in the proper order?
[19:14:35] <printForever> yeah
[19:14:41] <printForever> wait
[19:14:43] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you didn't.
[19:14:45] <printForever> should I include all of them?
[19:14:56] <robertmaxrees> you need to include all dependencies.
[19:15:04] <printForever> oh crap
[19:15:07] <printForever> ok
[19:15:08] <robertmaxrees> not sure what folder you're talking about.
[19:15:11] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[19:15:30] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to reference every file in, say, the zip you download from select2
[19:16:10] <robertmaxrees> so what folder are yout alking about printForever
[19:17:26] <printForever> just got more errors now robertmaxrees
[19:17:41] <robertmaxrees> right, what folder are you talking about.
[19:17:49] <printForever> Uncaught ReferenceError: define is not defined
[19:17:55] <printForever> the one inside select2
[19:17:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, something tells me you're really lost ;)
[19:18:07] <robertmaxrees> you don't want all of those file.s  just dependencies.
[19:18:19] <robertmaxrees> paste up all the script tags you've got.
[19:18:39] <printForever> select2 > src > js > select2 > and there are several there
[19:18:51] <robertmaxrees> i have literally no idea what you've placed in that folder.
[19:19:06] <robertmaxrees> did you just copy the contents from the zip you downloaded from GH?
[19:19:17] <printForever> no
[19:19:17] <robertmaxrees> like, give me somethign to work with here
[19:19:25] <printForever> screenshot?
[19:19:32] <printForever> fiddle
[19:19:36] <robertmaxrees> copy/paste the relevant html script includes.
[19:19:41] <robertmaxrees> into a bpaste or something.
[19:22:23] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/87ymb1av/
[19:22:58] <robertmaxrees> so you're doing this via require?
[19:23:13] <printForever> yes, because I need the dropdown to stay down
[19:23:31] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with what i just said.
[19:23:31] <printForever> (it switches position based on the available space between up and bottom of the view port)
[19:23:45] <printForever> I said yes.
[19:23:59] <robertmaxrees> your "because" has literally nothing to do with what i just said.
[19:24:04] <printForever> ok
[19:24:06] <robertmaxrees> are you overriding some behavior?
[19:24:07] <printForever> sorry
[19:24:09] <printForever> yes
[19:24:13] <printForever> yes
[19:25:01] <printForever> Error: undefined missing select2/dropdown/attachContainer
[19:25:06] <robertmaxrees> i can read ;)
[19:25:12] <printForever> again, sorry
[19:25:27] <robertmaxrees> calm down yo.
[19:26:08] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/3239
[19:26:50] <printForever> Thats what I found in my searches, but I couldn't find how to attach the missing files
[19:28:19] <printForever> I tried moving the folder (which contains that structure) in several places in relation to the select2.js file, but the dependencies never loaded.
[19:28:22] <robertmaxrees> did you read the thread?
[19:29:33] <printForever> I've read it, but it doesn't tell me how to add those dependencies.
[19:29:39] <robertmaxrees> then you didn't read it.

[19:29:59] <robertmaxrees> WOOPS
[19:30:03] <robertmaxrees> "AttachContainer seems to be broken in 4.0.0. You can monkey-patch the missing bind method though:"
[19:31:00] <printForever> I tried that, does not work...
[19:31:11] <robertmaxrees> right, do you understand what that person is saying there?
[19:31:21] <robertmaxrees> "AttachContainer seems to be broken in 4.0.0"
[19:31:28] <printForever> I'm using 4.0.1
[19:32:17] <printForever> I'm getting Uncaught ReferenceError: AttachContainer is not defined when I change from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1
[19:32:53] <robertmaxrees> in that fiddle i get Error: undefined missing select2/dropdown/attachContainer
[19:33:07] <printForever> that's strange, I know
[19:33:31] <printForever> https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/select2/4.0.1/js/select2.js
[19:33:39] <robertmaxrees> again, i can see that.
[19:33:41] <printForever> same file two different erros
[19:35:17] <printForever> robertmaxrees, look this guy has the same problem http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32967238/select2-change-the-position-of-the-dropdown
[19:36:40] <robertmaxrees> where does he say he's getting that error?
[19:37:35] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet this is some kind of weird loading via cdn thing or something.
[19:38:18] <printForever> can I upload entire file into fiddle?
[19:38:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:38:41] <robertmaxrees> well i mean, you COULD, but that's barely readable.
[19:38:57] <robertmaxrees> but wait your'e getting that error even with your local copy, right?
[19:39:17] <printForever> all I'm trying to do is to force the dropdown to stay down

[19:41:22] <robertmaxrees> ffff
[19:41:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/brunodd/jEADR/2009/
[19:41:30] <robertmaxrees> seems to work fine.
[19:42:50] <printForever> nope
[19:43:07] <printForever> Uncaught Error: undefined missing select2/dropdown/attachContainer
[19:44:29] <printForever> select2.full.js
[19:44:33] <printForever> I can't use select2.full.js
[19:44:36] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[19:44:37] <printForever> thats the problem
[19:44:44] <printForever> becuase it contains mousewheel controls
[19:45:43] <printForever> :(
[19:46:15] <robertmaxrees> and you have the attchContainer file in the dropdown folder?
[19:46:27] <printForever> welll, now I deleted it
[19:46:41] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/jEADR/2440/
[19:46:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:47:05] <printForever> and now we are back to square 1 and my question
[19:47:16] <printForever> how do I include attachContainer
[19:47:17] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[19:47:17] <printForever> :(
[19:47:30] <printForever> I've edited your fiddle
[19:47:32] <robertmaxrees> make sure the file is in the dropdown folder on your serber.
[19:47:32] <printForever> the one you created
[19:47:34] <robertmaxrees> *server
[19:47:37] <robertmaxrees> that wasn't my fiddle.
[19:47:43] <robertmaxrees> that was from an SO question.
[19:47:56] <printForever> ok, you've pasted it
[19:48:08] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to manually include files - you're not going to get that to work on fiddle since that's trying to actually load things.
[19:48:08] <printForever> the problem with it is that its using full version of select2.js
[19:48:20] <robertmaxrees> i read as much earlier.
[19:48:24] <printForever> oh
[19:48:33] <robertmaxrees> so your server is where you want to be.
[19:49:00] <printForever> ok... because I'm not sure where the folder select2/dropdown/attachContainer should be located
[19:49:03] <printForever> where do I put it?
[19:49:13] <printForever> in relation to the select.js
[19:49:15] <robertmaxrees> attachContainer is a js file.
[19:49:18] <printForever> it is
[19:49:27] <robertmaxrees> you called it a folder a second ago.
[19:49:37] <printForever> I'm trying to follow the Console
[19:49:40] <printForever> of course its a file
[19:49:51] <printForever> I just copied what it printed out
[19:50:00] <printForever> the folder is select2 and dropdown
[19:50:04] <printForever> the file is attachContainer
[19:50:12] <printForever> I wanted to know, where to put select2 folder
[19:50:14] <robertmaxrees> right.   i'm well aware of this.
[19:50:23] <printForever> in relation to the select2.js file
[19:50:28] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/select2/select2/tree/master/src/js
[19:50:32] <robertmaxrees> see how this is laid out?
[19:50:50] <printForever> so, problem here is that it contais no select2.js
[19:50:53] <robertmaxrees> it'd look something like this, but it would be MUCH smarter for you to actually build this properly.
[19:51:18] <robertmaxrees> right, this assumes you're going to build out the plugin and include it as a single file.
[19:51:43] <printForever> oh, ok
[19:51:51] <printForever> and where do I put it?
[19:51:58] <printForever> or should I edit the script
[19:52:08] <printForever> and just write the file name there, without the folders
[19:52:15] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:52:19] <printForever> and put the dependant file in the same folder as select2.js?
[19:52:28] <robertmaxrees> if you buold it, you have a single js file and noi more folders
[19:52:31] <robertmaxrees> *build
[19:52:44] <printForever> build it?
[19:52:49] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[19:52:50] <printForever> compile?
[19:52:57] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[19:53:10] <robertmaxrees> it takes all those files and packs them down into a single one.
[19:53:34] <printForever> oh...
[19:53:44] <printForever> but when I included them all
[19:53:46] <printForever> it didn't work
[19:54:04] <robertmaxrees> right, you'll probably need to edit the gruntfile to only include the items you seen.
[19:54:19] <robertmaxrees> *you need
[19:54:56] <printForever> way out of the scope of my abilities
[19:55:56] <robertmaxrees> there may be another way to get you what you want, but it'll probably require editing some things.
[19:56:17] <printForever> I just want dropdown to stay down
[19:56:20] <printForever> nothing else
[19:56:36] <robertmaxrees> while not using the "full" version of the file.
[19:56:56] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I'm gonna ask you for a favour now :)
[19:57:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to do this for you.
[19:57:06] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[19:57:15] <printForever> https://github.com/select2/select2/blob/master/dist/js/select2.js
[19:57:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:57:22] <printForever> line 4195
[19:57:28] <printForever> just look at it
[19:57:37] <printForever> :D I don't want you to write anything
[19:57:42] <printForever> just look at that line
[19:57:57] <robertmaxrees> you know you can click that line number and shoot me that link, right?
[19:58:15] <printForever> never used github that much
[19:58:16] <robertmaxrees> so what?
[19:58:30] <printForever> well... if I set enoughRoomAbove to true
[19:58:41] <shoky> printForever maybe this helps.. http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/26/
[19:58:42] <printForever> and enoughRoomBelow to false, it still works the same
[19:59:04] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahaha
[19:59:07] <printForever> LOL
[19:59:13] <printForever> shoky I LOVE YOU
[19:59:17] <printForever> and I'm not sorry
[19:59:19] <robertmaxrees> shoky it has an internal reference to the mousewheel plugin i think.
[19:59:21] <shoky> you mean like again, right? :((((
[19:59:28] <printForever> no!
[19:59:33] <printForever> LUVZ YOUZ
[19:59:37] <printForever> #NoHomo
[19:59:48] <shoky> robertmaxrees yeah but doing this hack seems to fix his problem with the mousewheel thing
[19:59:57] <shoky> so may be enough for him, donno
[19:59:58] <robertmaxrees> without errors?
[20:00:06] <printForever> no errors
[20:00:13] <robertmaxrees> and does it actually work?  because it's loading the mousewheel plugin via require.
[20:00:23] <robertmaxrees> unless it's doing it "the wrong way" and not scoping things properly.
[20:00:27] <shoky> i don't see any errors, and also, i saw this part in the select2 code:
[20:00:33] <shoky>  if ($.fn.mousewheel) {   ...   }
[20:00:46] <robertmaxrees> so then that won't run.  hah.
[20:00:48] <robertmaxrees> that's lolsy.
[20:00:59] <shoky> ;p
[20:01:33] <printForever> its working
[20:01:42] <robertmaxrees> hah.  that's funny.
[20:01:58] <printForever> shoky, you should be paid in gold, in your weight
[20:02:26] <shoky> i'd surely like that ;p
[20:02:29] <printForever> but the dropdown is going up and down
[20:02:31] <printForever> :(
[20:02:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:02:52] <printForever> I've changed enoughRoomAbove to true and enoughRoomBelow to false
[20:03:37] <shoky> haven't looked at your new fiddle, just saw you were wanting the .full.js but without the mousewheel
[20:03:59] <printForever> I can now add full.js
[20:04:04] <printForever> I will use that code from fiddle
[20:04:33] <printForever> works!
[20:04:36] <printForever> like a charm
[20:06:17] <printForever> thank you shoky!
[20:06:34] <printForever> robertmaxrees, thank you, but not so much... you always tourture me...
[20:06:42] <robertmaxrees> no need to be rude man.
[20:06:47] <robertmaxrees> sorry for trying to help.
[20:07:06] <arc_> robertmaxrees tries to teach you rather than just doing the work for you
[20:07:06] <printForever> oy! wut y said m8?
[20:07:13] <printForever> :D
[20:07:17] <robertmaxrees> arc_ gets it.
[20:07:17] <arc_> you will be better off for it
[20:07:17] <printForever> I know I know
[20:07:31] <printForever> but when he starts asking is it a file or a folder
[20:07:42] <printForever> come on... I'm new to jQuery, but I'm not a retard
[20:07:43] <robertmaxrees> for context and information?  how awful.
[20:07:46] <robertmaxrees> hey!
[20:07:50] <robertmaxrees> not an ok word.
[20:08:02] <robertmaxrees> and i'm not saying you don't know what you're doing when I ask for code.
[20:08:06] <printForever> I agree, we are IT people and we should be precise
[20:08:24] <printForever> sometimes, to cut things short, there is an implied understanding
[20:08:42] <robertmaxrees> sure - it has nothing to do with that.
[20:08:48] <printForever> I'm just saying. I undertand the methods, just cut some slack...
[20:08:50] <robertmaxrees> i cannot divine your code.
[20:08:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sayign you don't!
[20:08:57] <printForever> of course, you are correct
[20:09:00] <robertmaxrees> i know.
[20:09:21] <printForever> there are tons of people who come here, and you're not in their head to understand what is going on
[20:09:27] <shoky> printForever robertmaxrees is not torturing you, he's doing an A+++++++++ job at trying to get you to learn for real so you can tackle problems on your own in the future
[20:09:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.  nor am i in yours.
[20:09:42] <shoky> without learning good like that you're just torturing yourself :S
[20:10:02] <printForever> always, before coming here, I do my due dilligence and check any resource I can find. That's why I have already visited most of the links I get.
[20:10:16] <printForever> shoky, I absolutely agree
[20:10:17] <robertmaxrees> like, shoky a+ for saving the day, but you're not always going to have somebodyu here to give you solutions.
[20:10:29] <printForever> just sometimes, I would like to think that some things are implied
[20:10:38] <robertmaxrees> it can't be though.
[20:10:48] <shoky> it's much much better if it's not
[20:11:02] <robertmaxrees> if you're having trouble and aren't sure how to fix it, how can I possibly trust your description?
[20:11:20] <printForever> I also agree there. Sometimes when something is implied it misses everyones attention and it turns out to be the cause of the problem.
[20:11:25] <robertmaxrees> it's not that i think you're incapable, it's that you might not really understand your code.
[20:11:37] <printForever> yes, I have nothing to add, I absolutely agree with you
[20:11:54] <printForever> in few scenarios, that even helped me
[20:12:00] <printForever> I questioned myself and found the problem
[20:12:06] <printForever> before going into details here
[20:12:19] <robertmaxrees> 1/2 the time, making a test case actually helps you solve the problem.
[20:12:31] <arc_> there's nothing wrong with not knowing something, and nobody is going to fault you for it
[20:12:38] <printForever> it would help if fiddle had some premade examples
[20:12:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:12:40] <arc_> help us help you, don't fight us
[20:12:46] <printForever> like paragraphs, lists, select>option...
[20:12:56] <robertmaxrees> printForever you can tab complete html tags.
[20:13:02] <printForever> thats not enoguh
[20:13:04] <robertmaxrees> and most test cases aren't as complex as yours.
[20:13:15] <printForever> yeah
[20:13:15] <robertmaxrees> there's no need to blame to tool for that.
[20:13:23] <printForever> but still, it would be nice to have that option there
[20:13:26] <printForever> ooooh no no no
[20:13:30] <printForever> I'm not blaiming anyone
[20:13:41] <robertmaxrees> err, how are they going to account for every little thing somebody might need for an example?
[20:13:49] <printForever> I'm saying that people are detered from fiddle, because they have to set it up from scratch
[20:14:01] <printForever> if it had some premade code, like paragraphs or a demo page or something
[20:14:07] <printForever> it would be a lot user friendlier
[20:14:33] <robertmaxrees> except now people arne't actually providing their code
[20:14:33] <printForever> robertmaxrees, they can add basic tags with Lorem ipsum, that would be MORE THAN ENOUGH
[20:14:49] <robertmaxrees> so have bad tags in their page but not on fiddle.  see the issue?
[20:14:51] <printForever> well, people don't like to share the code
[20:14:57] <printForever> aaaa
[20:15:00] <printForever> you're right
[20:15:02] <printForever> yes
[20:15:18] <robertmaxrees> :) also, jsfiddle is more of a playground, not a troubleshooting tool.
[20:15:35] <printForever> I'm coming from the point where I just need help with logical stand point of jQuery, but many have issues even with simple code...
[20:15:43] <printForever> yeah
[20:15:48] <printForever> nothing to argue really
[20:16:31] <printForever> I was just surprised when we were going for the details at such a low and basic level.
[20:17:04] <robertmaxrees> right - because you want to change basic functionality.  shoky worked around the plugin to get you the fix you want.
[20:17:07] <printForever> in the end, thanks for your patience and help
[20:17:25] <robertmaxrees> but learning to explore can get you there, y'know?
[20:17:43] <printForever> only problem with that is... there isn't always time to do that...
[20:18:00] <robertmaxrees> that's why you invest the time to learn.
[20:18:18] <robertmaxrees> your development time needs to account for those "unknowns", y'know?
[20:18:42] <printForever> no doubt about it
[20:18:57] <robertmaxrees> so then there usually *is* time :)
[20:19:45] <printForever> again...
[20:19:50] <printForever> the dropdown is going up
[20:19:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:19:57] <printForever> even with the fiddle you pasted robertmaxrees
[20:20:01] <printForever> yeah...
[20:20:05] <printForever> I'm baffled
[20:20:14] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea which one that is, but ok.
[20:20:50] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/brunodd/jEADR/2009/
[20:21:20] <robertmaxrees> that very fiddle is working here - show me where it's not working.
[20:22:50] <printForever> sec
[20:24:02] <printForever> fixed it
[20:24:09] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:24:19] <printForever> :))))
[20:24:38] <printForever> btw. how old are you robertmaxrees, shoky, arc_?
[20:27:06] <printForever> also, shoky, since you're most familiar with select2 (unwillingly but...) is there a way to disable the removal of tags from the list. So, once the tag is added, you cant "unselect it" by clicking on it again on the list.
[20:28:44] <arc_> i'm 32
[20:29:06] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/32336094 printForever does this help?
[20:29:07] <printForever> I'm 32 in January
[20:29:09] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/28/
[20:29:12] <robertmaxrees> and i'm all of 28
[20:30:27] <printForever> :)
[20:30:40] <printForever> 83, 84 and 88
[20:30:56] <robertmaxrees> though i always find age, gender, etc totally irrelevant when it comes to development.
[20:30:59] <robertmaxrees> for the record.
[20:31:08] <printForever> dully noted
[20:31:11] <printForever> :D
[20:31:45] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/30/
[20:31:47] <printForever> OMG IT WORKS
[20:32:27] <printForever> can I chain multiple .on()?
[20:32:52] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com/on/ - see the "returns"?
[20:34:06] <printForever> I can!
[20:34:41] <robertmaxrees> so that means .on() returns a jquery object - that usually means it's whatever you're chaining off of originally.
[20:35:47] <robertmaxrees> though i usually avoid chaining multiple .on() calls together, it works.
[20:36:15] <printForever> wtf is going on in California!?
[20:36:23] <robertmaxrees> san bernardino?
[20:39:32] <printForever> the shootings
[20:39:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, san bernardino.
[20:40:38] <printForever> those people...
[20:41:52] <shoky> printForever i'm gonna be 33 this month
[20:43:02] <printForever> oh, so youre 82nd
[20:43:07] <shoky> aye
[20:43:23] <printForever> well, we're all about the same age
[20:43:24] <robertmaxrees> 82nd?
[20:43:28] <printForever> 1982
[20:43:32] <robertmaxrees> ah
[20:43:40] <printForever> how do you cope with being 32-33?
[20:43:48] <shoky> denial
[20:43:52] <printForever> lol, me too
[20:43:57] <shoky> ;)
[20:43:58] <printForever> married?
[20:44:01] <printForever> with kids? :D
[20:44:06] <shoky> nopes & nopes ;]
[20:44:12] <printForever> same here
[20:44:21] <printForever> time flies when you're coding
[20:45:08] <printForever> btw. Firefox is not respecting Select2 forcing to open the dropdown only down.
[20:45:22] <robertmaxrees> that fiddle was working for me earlier.
[20:45:27] <robertmaxrees> and i use FF.
[20:45:46] <printForever> my bad
[20:45:49] <printForever> totally my bad

[20:46:17] <printForever> I will NEVER again purchase cordless keyboard
[20:46:31] <printForever> you can't imagine how laggy it is
[20:46:37] <robertmaxrees> i had a logi years ago that was fantastic.
[20:46:39] <robertmaxrees> no lag at all.
[20:46:54] <arc_> as did i, but then i realized there's no reason for a keyboard to be wireless :p
[20:46:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:47:08] <robertmaxrees> i got lazy and hated replacing the batteries all the time.
[20:47:14] <printForever> ok, not for someone doing 1-2 key presses a minute... but when you're typing as fast as most of us do... its really slow
[20:47:22] <printForever> this is Logitech K350
[20:47:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it was fine for me.
[20:47:30] <arc_> sounds like you have some interference
[20:47:51] <printForever> only reason I bought it was the integrated palm rest from artificial leather
[20:47:59] <printForever> or whatever it is, its good
[20:48:11] <printForever> arc_ I have everyhing
[20:48:22] <printForever> do you turn off routers WiFi at night?
[20:48:30] <arc_> no o_O
[20:48:32] <printForever> :D
[20:48:39] <printForever> I have a router 2 meters away
[20:48:43] <printForever> set to 20% strenght
[20:48:49] <printForever> cant be good
[20:48:53] <arc_> mine is about 1 foot away from me
[20:49:17] <printForever> I hope science and medicine get better...
[20:49:25] <printForever> because we're not getting any younger, that's for sure
[20:50:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:50:44] <ckim> where are you come from ? I from china
[20:50:50] <printForever> StarWars premier anyone?
[20:51:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm waiting a few weeks probably.
[20:51:34] <printForever> ckim, how are you accessing freenode? I've heard that most of the services are banned?
[20:51:51] <printForever> robertmaxrees, somehow I think it won't be good
[20:52:02] <robertmaxrees> whaaaat!?  it's going to be great.
[20:52:10] <printForever> JarJar Abrams?
[20:52:15] <printForever> The creator who got LOST in LOST?
[20:52:16] <shoky> lol
[20:52:20] <printForever> He ruined StarTrek!
[20:52:41] <printForever> He made StarTrek look like Starship Troopers
[20:52:46] <robertmaxrees> wut
[20:53:01] <robertmaxrees> you realize that he made the entire series more accessible to everyone, right?
[20:53:07] <printForever> robertmaxrees, you're old enough, you should have seen that movie :)
[20:53:18] <printForever> I don't want it to be accessible!
[20:53:23] <printForever> I want it to be StarTrek
[20:53:23] <robertmaxrees> i did see it.
[20:53:33] <robertmaxrees> i hate star trek - it was actually a decent flick.
[20:53:39] <printForever> it was an abomination
[20:54:13] <printForever> he was trying do to fan service by remastering audio... pffff
[20:54:15] <printForever> yeah...
[20:54:28] <arc_> some of star trek tng is like unmissable television
[20:54:32] <printForever> plot holes are so big... you can drive 747 through it
[20:54:37] <arc_> i can see why people would think star trek has some boring elements but
[20:54:43] <printForever> he ruined Enterprise
[20:54:46] <arc_> tng is an important series
[20:55:02] <printForever> it looked like it was shoot in Apple store with lights set to 500%
[20:55:11] <printForever> DS9!
[20:55:13] <printForever> TNG!
[20:55:18] <robertmaxrees> lol welp.
[20:55:24] <printForever> DS9 was awesome
[20:56:02] <printForever> I still prefer TOS movies than TNG.
[20:56:08] <printForever> but I prefer TNG series over TOS.
[20:56:32] <printForever> It's a shame there wasn't a DS9-VOY-TNG movie.
[21:15:09] <Mark__> is there any way i can bind this ajaxsetup to specific ajaxcall…? anyone?http://jsfiddle.net/scbzrvkp/
[21:22:32] <shoky> Mark__: you just use those options on that specific $.ajax call.. that's exactly what $.ajaxSetup is NOT for
[21:22:54] <shoky> it shouldn't really be used at all, hardly ever
[21:23:06] <Mark__> are you saying i should not be using ajaxsetup?
[21:23:12] <Mark__> i got these codes from stackoverflow.
[21:23:15] <Mark__> for spinners.
[21:23:20] <shoky> yes
[21:23:36] <shoky> and you shouldn't copy code from SO without understanding it
[21:23:55] <Mark__> i think i understood just fine as to how the funtion’s working.
[21:24:09] <Mark__> *function
[21:24:14] <shoky> $.ajaxSetup is for setting options for ALL ajax calls. not for a specific one
[21:24:27] <Mark__> yeah, that’s why im asking right now.
[21:24:33] <Mark__> is there any other way?
[21:24:41] <shoky> any other way to do what?
[21:24:46] <Mark__> there isn’t really simpler way to bring out spinners.
[21:24:57] <shoky> just do whatever you want before the call
[21:25:02] <shoky> and do whatever you want in the callbacks
[21:25:47] <shoky> ...show Spinner...;  $.ajax({... complete: function() { ... hide it... }})
[21:26:11] <Mark__> okay thanks..
[21:26:24] <Mark__> idk why i didn’t make it that way in the first place..
[21:49:11] <printForever> shoky, have to ask
[21:49:29] <printForever> Select2 is offering keyboard keys support, but its not working on my end
[21:49:54] <printForever> it works here, and I've made no changes http://jsfiddle.net/tqa52p5k/30/
[21:50:39] <printForever> ok, it works, but I'm not getting anyhighlight color
[21:50:51] <printForever> O.o
[21:59:40] <printForever> how can I change custom HTML5 attribute?
[21:59:42] <printForever> aria-selected="false"
[21:59:47] <printForever> I want to set it to true
[22:00:06] <printForever> .attr("aria-selected":"true"); ??
[22:01:21] <printForever> .data( "aria-selected" ) === true;
[22:02:07] <printForever> .attr("aria-selected", "true");
[22:09:48] <athan> Hi everyone
[22:10:10] <athan> Does jquery "keep" response headers sent from a server?
[22:10:17] <athan> I'm trying to establish session cookies :\
[22:10:41] <athan> (or is this responsability deferred to the browser?)
[22:16:59] <WhirledPress> printForever, did you try $(
[22:17:17] <WhirledPress> lol Sorry, fat fingered the keyboard...one more try
[22:17:47] <WhirledPress> $(item).prop("aria-selected",true);
