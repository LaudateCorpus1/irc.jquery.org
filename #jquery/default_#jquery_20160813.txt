[00:11:02] <TimLoal> WhirledPress thanks for chatting and helping
[00:39:51] <renka> good morning. :)
[01:13:37] <mechanist> hello everyone
[01:14:03] <mechanist> I'd like to know why my jquery script doest not run the some_script.php page
[01:14:04] <mechanist> http://pastebin.com/iqjn3gnJ
[01:54:33] <numb21> hello all :D
[01:55:37] <numb21> I have this: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&rawcontinue=&generator=search&prop=extracts&exintro&explaintext&exsentences=1&exlimit=max&gsrsearch=a
[01:55:47] <numb21> and I need to parse a few contents from that url
[01:55:50] <numb21> using ajax
[01:56:08] <numb21> And I don't know how because there seems to be only {} and no []
[01:56:15] <numb21> Does this make sense?
[01:59:13] <Masber> hi
[01:59:34] <numb21> hi :D
[01:59:38] <Masber> how can I turn this "a, b, '1, 2, 3, 4'" into this ["a", "b", "1, 2, 3, 4"]?
[02:00:24] <numb21> arr = strVale.split(',');
[02:00:55] <Masber> split will split also the 3rd element of the string
[02:01:11] <Masber> I only want 3 elements in the array not 6
[02:01:46] <numb21> maybe you can split all 6 and remove the last three elements
[02:01:56] <numb21> but that's not the best way to do it i guess
[02:04:52] <numb21> use this @Masber string.split(separator,limit)
[02:05:04] <numb21> and place 3 in place of limit
[02:05:48] <Masber> ok, what if I have something like ["a", "b", "1, 2, 3, 4", "5, 6, 7, 8"]
[02:06:13] <numb21> and what should be the output?
[02:08:17] <Masber> I am basically reading a csv
[02:08:29] <Masber> and some fields have multiple values
[02:10:07] <Masber> for example a line like "a, b, c, "1, 2, 3"" then "1, 2, 3" is the value for 1 field
[04:58:20] <manoj_> hey i am newcomer I want to contribute code in jquery can anyone recommend me some newbie issues
[07:35:57] <sonu_nk> hi i am writing a script which is responsible for clicks on a list of button. but it is hanging my browser after some time.. i have total 250 button to click . can please take a look ?? http://pastebin.com/Scvi5e8p
[07:44:55] <TimLoal> sonu_nk can you set it up in jsfiddle.net
[07:45:47] <TimLoal> or link to a public server where it is
[08:01:03] <TimLoal> sonu_nk: youre setting the timeout interval as 50000, so for 25o buttons would take 3.5 hours to run
[08:06:38] <aiena> After firing ana AJAX post request with jquery to a  php script my url gets appended with a # and the ajax request does not fire again. QWhy does this happen
[08:06:47] <aiena> *an
[08:10:18] <TimLoal> aiena can you show us some code  http://www.jsfiddle.net
[08:11:16] <aiena> one moment
[08:13:40] <aiena> TimLoal: I mamy have found the problem. I remove a hidden input field if the request is the second request and the ajax request then doesnt fire. But still why does the url change hosting from localhost
[08:16:59] <aiena> guess still need to make a fiddle
[08:20:32] <TimLoal> glad to 'help', lets see if we can get it to the finish line
[08:22:15] <TimLoal> its often noted that asking the question or even formulating the question, you see the problem from a diffrent view point and the problem is obvious
[08:23:03] <TimLoal> we get code blind sometimes
[08:34:53] <alexander25> hi everyone, im having 3 checkboxes and want after 1 is selected that there should always be 1 selected from the 3
[08:35:06] <alexander25> any thoughts on how to approach this? i dont know where to start hehe
[08:35:18] <alexander25> i already have code so only 1 of the 3 can be selected
[08:35:31] <alexander25> but its possible to deselect and then leave none of the checkboxes checked
[08:36:11] <z1haze> anyone use requirejs in here? i am having issues with an error of 'myobject' is not a constructor type error
[08:36:35] <z1haze> example of what im doing: http://dpaste.com/0ZAPJQ8 the error happens at like 10
[08:36:46] <TimLoal> alexander25 have you come across radio buttons?  http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_radio
[08:37:09] <alexander25> TimLoal  yes i know but i need checkboxes for uniformity of my search form
[08:38:30] <TimLoal> are they the only check boxes?
[08:40:05] <TimLoal> you need to handle the click event and select the other two checkboxes by ID and force them to be unchecked
[08:40:07] <aiena> TimLoal: I think I got it of there is an <a href="#"> and a Jquery function is called does it redirect to # ?
[08:41:23] <TimLoal> aiena yes if you dont cancle the event
[08:42:34] <TimLoal> the lazy way is to return false in the click handler, but there are more correct modern ways
[08:45:25] <aiena> TimLoal: soo www.example.com will become www.example.com#
[08:45:38] <aiena> TimLoal: what is the correct way
[08:45:54] <TimLoal> z1haze  can you show us in  http://www.jsfiddle.net
[08:46:34] <z1haze> yea i just dont think its a fiddle kind of problem?
[08:46:59] <TimLoal> yes if the link is alowed to be fired, but you can cancel it so the url remains the same
[08:47:09] <z1haze> how do you plan to load requirejs files in a fiddle
[08:47:44] <aiena> z1haze: add it as an external resource
[08:47:45] <TimLoal> in a html script tag? @ z1haze
[08:47:59] <aiena> TimLoal:  I thought jsfiddle doesnt allow those
[08:48:09] <z1haze> ... it doesnt work that way
[08:48:18] <z1haze> guessing you haven tused requirejs
[08:48:24] <aiena> z1haze: add it as an external resource
[08:48:46] <aiena> left hand side choose "External resource" add requirejs url there
[08:48:50] <aiena> bootstrap etc there
[08:49:06] <TimLoal> yea i forgot you could do that, using so mant tools, i only remember what i need
[08:49:33] <aiena> jquery can also be added that way but not needed as it is there in the menu
[08:49:47] <z1haze> nevermind, you're missing the point
[08:50:08] <aiena> z1haze: hmm alright then
[08:50:10] <z1haze> requirejs loads files from a relative root path.
[08:50:25] <TimLoal> yea i did that on my first visit and it worked, then i found the options and so have an impression it works
[08:50:26] <z1haze> so it follows a certain directory structure
[08:50:51] <z1haze> no offense but thank you anyways ill wait
[08:50:54] <TimLoal> do you have it on a public server somewhere?
[08:51:14] <TimLoal> there are many ways up a mountain
[08:52:29] <z1haze> no
[08:53:21] <TimLoal> would you like to browse the gift shop while you wait?
[08:55:45] <TimLoal> brb just taking the dog out
[09:23:45] <TimLoal> bak
[09:57:25] <jak2000> hi all
[09:57:32] <jak2000> how to detect a ENTER key on a input box?
[09:57:59] <TimLoal> onkeypress
[10:00:36] <TimLoal> $(document).keypress(function(e) {  if(e.which == 13) {  alert('You pressed enter!');}});
[10:01:12] <TimLoal> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/979662/how-to-detect-pressing-enter-on-keyboard-using-jquery
[10:07:58] <jak2000> TimLoal Thanks
[10:07:59] <jak2000> testing
[10:08:30] <jak2000> other thing: the user press numbers ...... i want when the length of the capture = 5 then display an alert? understand me?
[10:10:05] <TimLoal> in the same function you can check the length of the value of the text box
[10:11:40] <TimLoal> https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=jquery+getting+the+value+of+atext+box
[10:18:02] <jak2000> but the length?
[10:24:24] <TimLoal> i don't mind helping with problems but stuff you can look up on google is a bit lazy
[10:25:16] <TimLoal> .length https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=jquery+getting+the+value+of+atext+box
[10:26:08] <TimLoal> https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=jquery+get+the+length+of+a+string
[11:01:57] <jak2000> thanks
[11:06:18] <relipse> does anyone know how to add a link to the fancybox title underneath the picture? It just pops up with "<a href="blah"> instead of rendering it as html
[12:26:25] <TimLoal> relipse can you show us some code  http://www.jsfiddle.net
[12:27:43] <TimLoal> or on a public server
[14:11:54] <HeyJoe> Hey guys.
[14:12:48] <HeyJoe> My computer crashed and I lost my chat history. The jquery site says  thus chan is logged but I can't find it. Can you help ?
[14:13:57] <HeyJoe> Haha! Thank you MOTD!
[14:30:58] <TimLoal> heyjoe, thers this but i don't see anything http://www.irclogger.com/.jquery/2016-08-13
[14:32:25] <TimLoal> maybe the bot isnt running
[14:32:43] <TimLoal> what client you using?
[14:47:06] <zotherstupidguy> whats the easiest way to send login form data via ajax?
[14:56:11] <TimLoal> zotherstupidguy seralize the form and send it in a get request
[15:01:41] <Captain_Ramius> OK, anyone seen robertmaxrees?
[15:01:50] <Captain_Ramius> He was helping me the other day, but it's not quite there.
[15:02:19] <Captain_Ramius> My form was submitting twice. He said to never use onsubmit or onclick, but I took them out and now it doesn't submit at all.
[15:04:33] <shoky> Captain_Ramius he's not here usually on weekends but there are others. as always, ask your question, and link to a jsfiddle/testcase showing the problem
[15:06:24] <Captain_Ramius> shoky, thanks.  https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4j7jdu9n/2/
[15:06:40] <Captain_Ramius> I'm running PHP and it reloads the page every time the form is submitted.
[15:07:11] <Captain_Ramius> I have event.preventDefault() in a jquery function for each of my 3 forms
[15:07:32] <shoky> Captain_Ramius: uh you don't even have any url for the $.ajax
[15:07:47] <Captain_Ramius> LIne 8
[15:08:04] <shoky> Captain_Ramius: you're not passing a url to $.ajax
[15:08:16] <Captain_Ramius> then what's it doing?
[15:08:22] <shoky> what's what doing?
[15:08:41] <Captain_Ramius> It says `$("#outputRow").load(fullUrl); `
[15:08:45] <shoky> also, as robert told you, never use onsubmit/onclick/on*
[15:08:56] <shoky> that is the .load method, not $.ajax
[15:09:03] <Captain_Ramius> I don't think you're seeing the chagnes I made to the fiddle
[15:09:05] <rhizome> don't use .on?
[15:09:16] <shoky> no,  onsubmit/onclick/on* attributes
[15:09:26] <rhizome> oh, on-asterisk
[15:09:46] <shoky> Captain_Ramius i see whatever you see when you go to that link ;p
[15:09:48] <Captain_Ramius> shoky, Sorry, I just hit "Update" on the fiddle.
[15:09:54] <shoky> Captain_Ramius: then you have a new url
[15:10:08] <Captain_Ramius> Now it's https://jsfiddle.net/4j7jdu9n/4/
[15:10:15] <Captain_Ramius> the one I gave you before was /2/
[15:10:27] <shoky> ok. still not passing a url to $.ajax
[15:10:54] <Captain_Ramius> Line 13 doesn't say $("#outputRow").load(fullUrl); ?
[15:11:04] <shoky> you do that with the 'url' option e.g.  $.ajax({url: '/some_url.php', success: ..., error: ...})
[15:11:14] <shoky> line 13 happens only in the success of the $.ajax
[15:11:28] <shoky> it's not the url option passed to $.ajax
[15:11:33] <Captain_Ramius> Ohhh, I see.
[15:11:50] <Captain_Ramius> I'm saying "load this URL" if the AJAX works, but the AJAX isn't doing anything.
[15:12:04] <shoky> right, because ajax needs a url too ;p
[15:12:20] <shoky> just like forms do
[15:12:50] <Captain_Ramius> OK, I'm going to read up on the AJAX options. I don't know why I would take that out.
[15:13:09] <shoky> are there 2 different urls you want to load..?
[15:13:13] <shoky> or just one..?
[15:13:40] <shoky> because  $.ajax  does one ajax request.  and then .load  does another ajax request
[15:13:56] <shoky> so if you only want the .load... then only do the load ;p
[15:14:48] <Captain_Ramius> Just one
[15:15:09] <Captain_Ramius> I think someone told me to just use .load instead of using 2-3 options.
[15:15:13] <Captain_Ramius> That's why url: is not set
[15:15:35] <Captain_Ramius> "$.get() and .load() are available and are easier to use."
[15:15:55] <shoky> yea so they meant to use .load instead of $.ajax i guess
[15:16:11] <rhizome> those methods call .ajax, so you've got things turned around
[15:17:17] <rhizome> $('#banner').load('some_ad.html')
[15:18:49] <Captain_Ramius> So I can just pull the big .ajax()
[15:19:23] <Captain_Ramius> and simply say var fullUrl = blahblahblah and .load(fullUrl)?
[15:20:09] <Captain_Ramius> Hmmm, it still reloads the page.
[15:20:44] <Captain_Ramius> BRB
[15:20:50] <shoky> it's not the .load doing it
[15:24:14] <Captain_Ramius> That's what the .preventDefault() is for right?
[15:25:15] <shoky> assuming that form is being submitted, yes
[15:25:32] <shoky> do you eevn call that function anywhere?
[15:25:39] <shoky> getSingleItem()
[15:26:00] <shoky> are you getting the console logs
[15:26:13] <Captain_Ramius> No, it's not called by name.
[15:26:20] <shoky> (make sure to "preserve log")
[15:26:25] <Captain_Ramius> It was in the onsubmit that robert told me to ditch.
[15:26:32] <shoky> uh if it's not called then it won't run :)
[15:26:41] <Captain_Ramius> Haha. Funny how that works.
[15:26:49] <Captain_Ramius> How do I call it then?
[15:26:49] <shoky> don't put it in a function if you dont need it in one
[15:27:01] <Captain_Ramius> *How do I USE it then?
[15:27:05] <shoky> just put that code in your script or in your $(document).ready if you have that
[15:27:14] <shoky> you just put the code there
[15:27:26] <Captain_Ramius> It's in page.js, which is included in page.php
[15:27:36] <shoky> ok but it's in a function right now
[15:27:48] <Captain_Ramius> *not included, called in the <head>
[15:27:59] <shoky> so either call that function,  or just put the code outside of a function
[15:28:05] <Captain_Ramius> So, I just remove the function structure?
[15:28:36] <shoky> yes...?  code in your script that is not in any function will just get run when that script is loaded
[15:29:14] <shoky> if it's in your <head>  then you need to put this code in a $(document).ready handler
[15:29:34] <shoky> either that or don't put it in <head>,  put it at the end of your <body> tag
[15:31:50] <Captain_Ramius> I see. Can I leave it in the separate file and load the separate file from the end of the <body>
[15:32:15] <shoky> if you want
[15:33:08] <shoky> that's what i meant, if i understand you right ;p
[15:33:26] <shoky> <body> .....   <script src="script.js"></script> </body>
[15:34:29] <Captain_Ramius> Woohoo!
[15:35:26] <Captain_Ramius> Thanks!
[15:35:48] <shoky> sure
[15:35:50] <Captain_Ramius> Though I'm still a bit confused because this configuration is WAY different than what I had before.
[15:36:06] <Captain_Ramius> But maybe it was working "for the wrong reason"
[15:36:12] <shoky> most likely ;]
[15:37:05] <shoky> feel free to ask away if you want to clear something up
[15:38:26] <Captain_Ramius> I'm not sure how it was doing it before. I made this with robertmaxrees a few weeks ago and then worked on other parts since then.
[15:38:43] <Captain_Ramius> I think it was the onsubmit calling that specific function.
[15:38:51] <Captain_Ramius> That's how it worked the right way for the wrong reason.
[15:39:10] <Captain_Ramius> When he told me to drop the onsubmit, then it fell apart.
[15:39:42] <Captain_Ramius> He was right, though: I'd rather do it the hard, correct way than the easy, wrong way.
[15:39:42] <shoky> calling .on is something you usually do once on page load,  not every time some event happens (like you had it in onsubmit)
[15:40:34] <Captain_Ramius> Got it. That's the part of self-study that's making it harder. I don't know when I'm jerry rigging the code or taking the long way.
[15:41:22] <Captain_Ramius> Yeah, I remember: he said it was double loading because I had the onsubmit and the .on("submit"): pushing AND pulling so to speak.
[15:42:29] <Captain_Ramius> One more thing:
[15:42:47] <Captain_Ramius> What's it called when code is outside a function, like we just made this .on("submit")
[15:44:03] <shoky> if it's outside any function then it's in the "global" scope
[15:45:11] <Captain_Ramius> I'm making a commit message of what I did and I wanted to describe moving it outside a function.
[15:45:28] <Captain_Ramius> "Made this part 'global'"?
[15:47:47] <shoky> i guess. though the important thing is that it gets executed on page load. not sure what commit msg i'd put ;)  probably "minor refactoring" :P
[15:51:27] <Captain_Ramius> Haha. Maybe minor to you!
[16:08:44] <plamb> whats the method to change an HTML type tag
[16:08:51] <plamb> if i have a .html()
[16:11:08] <shoky> method to do what?
[16:11:34] <plamb> like
[16:11:49] <plamb> if i have a <input value="blah" />
[16:11:51] <TimLoal> change = replace?
[16:11:57] <plamb> and i want to change the "blah" on click
[16:12:11] <plamb> i can grab the <input> using .html()
[16:12:14] <shoky> .val() is for getting/setting input values
[16:13:02] <TimLoal> do you have some in code?
[16:13:21] <TimLoal> can you show us something  http://www.jsfiddle.net
[16:13:29] <plamb> one sec
[16:14:16] <plamb> hmm
[16:14:43] <plamb> .val grabs the values contents
[16:14:46] <plamb> how would i say, delete them
[16:15:13] <plamb> basically $(this).val().delete is what im looking for
[16:15:26] <TimLoal> in HTML what do you want to change from and to?
[16:16:09] <plamb> ah i think this might work
[16:16:10] <plamb> $('#t1').attr('value', '');
[16:16:13] <plamb> .attr
[16:16:47] <plamb> yep
[16:18:33] <Woet> plamb: $('#t1').val('');
[16:18:35] <ardu> i'm trying to get a bookmarklet to load jQuery so i can play with it in chrome js console. i tried using this (among others): http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/04/better-stronger-safer-jquerify-bookmarklet/ and when i use it in e.g. wikipedia i get "jquery already loaded" even thought typeof jQuery == "undefined". what's going on?
[16:19:33] <Woet> ardu: try $
[16:20:07] <ardu> Woet: typeof $ == "function"
[16:20:09] <Woet> ardu: also, typeof jQuery works fine on wikipedia for me - https://i.imgur.com/zaccOe0.png
[16:20:14] <Woet> without a bookmarklet .
[16:20:24] <ardu> hmm
[16:21:38] <ardu> Woet: this is so strange then, i tried reloading the page and tried a different page too and still typeof jQuery == "undefined"
[16:21:47] <Woet> ardu: screenshot
[16:24:51] <ardu> Woet: http://i.imgur.com/870cMyI.png
[16:25:31] <Woet> ardu: look at the left top of the console
[16:25:36] <Woet> you're in a chrome extension
[16:25:41] <Woet> next to preserve log
[16:25:44] <Woet> click it and change it to "top"
[16:26:16] <ardu> Woet: oh wow now it's fine. thanks!!
[16:26:20] <Woet> np
[16:27:59] <TimLoal> anyone know of a good diagram of the jquery model?
[16:28:42] <TimLoal> it would realy help me to understand, but i cant find anything
[16:31:23] <ardu> Woet: i guess quite ufftopic, but.. whenever i load a new page it resorts to being before and i have to manually change it to 'top'. do you have any idea why would that be?
[16:31:38] <Woet> ardu: im not sure, i dont use chrome that often
[16:32:05] <ardu> Woet: okay, i'll try finding some place to help me with that. much thanks again
[16:33:08] <shoky> that annoys me too
[16:37:26] <TimLoal> or could someone spend some time to help me fully understand the basics
[16:37:46] <Captain_Ramius> Anyone here know PHP and jquery?
[16:38:15] <Captain_Ramius> I'm trying to pass query results from a PHP page and set a .data() value.
[16:40:02] <Captain_Ramius> I'm sure I'm trying to do it the hard way.
[16:44:39] <CuriousMind> Why am I getting this error in Google Chrome dev tools? "jquery.js:3 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'createDocumentFragment' of null"
[16:54:05] <shoky> CuriousMind: probably means you're calling a jquery method on something that isn't a DOM element
[17:04:47] <YokoBR> hi guys and gals
[17:05:29] <YokoBR> i have a search input that grows when user focuses on it. But when i press the back button, i need it to go back to the previous size
[17:06:02] <YokoBR> how can i 'focus out' that, because even with .blur, it keeps open because the cursor is still there
[17:06:54] <TimLoal> shoky how can you tell the differance between when somthing is a dom element and when something is a jQuery object?
[17:08:25] <shoky> TimLoal: i meant that they had a jquery element that wraps something that's not a dom element.  e.g. $(window)  or $(someObject)
[18:52:23] <blip> hello all
[18:59:35] <TimLoal> hi blip
[19:07:03] <blip> got a jquery ui problem, is it the right place to ask?
[19:08:45] <TimLoal> go for it if you can show us an example on a server or in  http://www.jsfiddle.net
[19:09:51] <TimLoal> people tend to not answer till they see a specific question
[19:10:05] <TimLoal> saves the smalltalk
[19:16:02] <kEHN> hello
[19:16:56] <blip> https://jsfiddle.net/whpwz6wm/
[19:26:20] <Sal> how can i check if data-abc isn't empty?
[19:26:52] <Sal> i'm trying with .length > 0, but it doesn't work if data-abc contains a jason object
[19:27:02] <Sal> jason=json
[19:27:51] <Sal> is there a way to know if i have data-abc="aaa" or data-abc"" e data-abc="{a:b}"
[19:28:04] <Sal> e=or
[19:28:36] <kEHN> anyone experienced with filtering elements?
[19:28:59] <kEHN> been trying to get a search filter with multiple matches, but no success
[19:30:16] <shoky> just ask your question
[19:31:13] <kEHN> i dont have it on fiddle yet, just cutting it out before i can ask
[19:31:14] <shoky> Sal: if you want to know exactly what the value is you can use .attr('data-abc')
[19:31:39] <Sal> shoky, no, just want to know if its empty or not
[19:31:50] <Sal> i don't know what kind of checking to do
[19:32:37] <shoky> Sal:  .attr('data-abc').length
[19:32:52] <Sal> will that work for json objects too?
[19:33:08] <Sal> because i'm using length on data() directly, and its not working
[19:33:11] <shoky> yes, .attr returns a string
[19:33:18] <Sal> ok
[19:33:21] <Sal> thanks
[19:33:24] <Sal> let me try
[19:34:14] <shoky> though you can probably just check  .data('abc')  itself, truthy/falsy
[19:34:32] <shoky> depending on what values exactly you count as empty
[19:35:55] <Sal> shoky, http://2.gp/G5dr
[19:36:28] <shoky> Page not found
[19:36:57] <Sal> http://2.gp/G5ds
[19:37:06] <Sal> this is what data contains
[19:37:08] <shoky> same
[19:37:51] <shoky> not a very good url shortener :)
[19:37:55] <Sal> sorry, the image servbice is not working on shareX
[19:37:58] <Sal> i'll change
[19:38:12] <Sal> oh, yes
[19:38:17] <Sal> i was using goole
[19:38:21] <Sal> wait
[19:40:31] <Sal> shoky, https://goo.gl/sRGsnB
[19:40:52] <shoky> data-idx  not idx
[19:41:17] <Sal> oh, sorry
[19:41:23] <Sal> you're right, its an attr
[19:41:43] <Sal> perfect
[19:41:44] <Sal> thanks
[19:41:47] <Sal> it works
[19:41:51] <shoky> cool
[19:42:27] <Sal> hey, i have 'idx' in a var named key
[19:42:47] <Sal> 'data-' + key ?
[19:43:01] <shoky> ?
[19:43:15] <Sal> i'll try it
[19:43:17] <shoky> :)
[19:45:06] <Sal> ok, working
[19:45:09] <Sal> thanks again
[19:45:29] <Sal> .attr('data-'+key).length > 0
[19:45:35] <Sal> thats it
[19:52:05] <kEHN> my question is how do i make a multi input filter : https://jsfiddle.net/31ysf7jL/2/
[19:52:07] <kEHN> failing badly
[19:59:09] <blip> kEHN: there is no id=mapfilter
[19:59:24] <kEHN> let me check
[19:59:47] <kEHN> oh no
[19:59:51] <kEHN> i missed it out
[20:00:13] <kEHN> https://jsfiddle.net/31ysf7jL/3/
[20:00:31] <kEHN> if you select a location it works, but when you select 'View All' it does not return to all items
[20:00:45] <kEHN> what should i be doing
[20:01:53] <blip> selectedItems.show() ?
[20:02:38] <kEHN> tried that, look : https://jsfiddle.net/31ysf7jL/5/
[20:02:58] <kEHN> View all now disables the filter with .show ()
[20:03:12] <kEHN> but if you select Location, then a weapon, it adds an element
[20:03:25] <kEHN> rather than remove 1 element
[20:03:38] <kEHN> i think my logic is wrong
[20:11:07] <blip> someone to check out https://jsfiddle.net/whpwz6wm/ ?
[20:18:43] <arc_> kEHN you are comparing filterMap on both if statements
[20:19:42] <arc_> not really familiar with the method you're using myself though
[20:20:09] <arc_> blip okay, what is the question
[20:20:18] <kEHN> yeah
[20:20:31] <kEHN> it clearly won't work as the 2 if statements are not connected
[20:20:56] <kEHN> am thinking about using a plugin instead
[20:21:02] <blip> the autocomplete selection does not always work
[20:21:26] <arc_> what is a circumstance under which it does not work
[20:22:00] <kEHN> https://jsfiddle.net/31ysf7jL/6/
[20:22:04] <kEHN> selecting one is fine
[20:22:11] <kEHN> soon as you select weapon it over rides
[20:22:17] <arc_> sorry, i was talking to blip
[20:22:21] <kEHN> ok np
[20:22:23] <blip> it's pretty random, but in most cases
[20:22:34] <arc_> it seems to always work for me
[20:23:25] <blip> strange
[20:24:06] <blip> when you type "ja" then select "javascript", does it work?
[20:24:56] <kEHN> drop down appears but the option is not selectable in chrome for me
[20:25:05] <arc_> yes blip
[20:25:27] <kEHN> is selectable via arrow keys though
[20:25:29] <arc_> oh with the mouse
[20:25:35] <blip> yes
[20:25:39] <arc_> yeah mouse doesn't work
[20:26:13] <arc_> this is like the simplest possible test case so it's probably just a bug
[20:26:14] <arc_> not your fault
[20:26:28] <blip> i think it's since 581bfb55bf4f4f614a6e0c0ac545cf1aa7d29d0a#diff-312047f9a8fc4a32a6429caa4a07d9f3
[20:26:36] <arc_> hahaha
[20:26:47] <arc_> makes sense, i totally understand
[20:29:15] <blip> i mean https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/581bfb55bf4f4f614a6e0c0ac545cf1aa7d29d0a
[20:35:55] <blip> i guess i should log a ticket, thank you
[20:37:53] <shoky> blip it's happening because of your focus handler
[20:39:04] <blip> yes but shouldn't it work?
[20:39:34] <blip> that was fine with jquery ui 1.11
[20:41:20] <shoky> oh i didn't know 1.12 is officially out
[20:41:39] <blip> i'll make the same jsfiddle with 1.11
[20:41:43] <shoky> no blog article, weird
[20:44:49] <blip> https://jsfiddle.net/zvmomf7h/
[20:49:52] <shoky> well i guess it's maybe worth a ticket if there isn't one, since the docs actually say "By giving an Autocomplete field focus or entering something into it, the plugin starts searching for entries that match"
[20:52:16] <blip> i'm on my way then, good night
[20:52:33] <shoky> gn
[20:52:38] <kEHN> anyone able to recommend a plugin for filtering ?
[21:40:34] <markusT> hi, i have a button that i'm trying to click with jquery, and make it look depressed, but even though i'm targeting and calling .click() the button just isn't being dpressed - there are no errors
