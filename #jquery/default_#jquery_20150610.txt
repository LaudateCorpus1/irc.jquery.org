[00:26:36] <tuskkk___> How do I correctly toggle the 'files' class here? http://jsfiddle.net/nr80p77m/
[00:28:38] <Cork> .you can't toggle the class if you remove it
[00:28:52] <Cork> cause as it gets removed it won't exist anything to search for again
[00:29:55] <Cork> or do you mean toggle the visibility of the element with the class?
[00:30:05] <tuskkk___> Cork: yes visibility
[00:30:16] <tuskkk___> but right now I guess the on method isnt even firing...
[00:30:51] <Cork> also you bind the click handler to the icon element
[00:30:54] <Meir`> tuskkk___, looks like you're trying to find() '.files' inside '.cloud-attach'
[00:31:02] <Meir`> which isn't correct
[00:31:14] <Cork> Meir`: there is plenty of problems here
[00:31:27] <tuskkk___> Ok
[00:32:43] <Cork> tuskkk___: i think this is what you want http://jsfiddle.net/nr80p77m/1/
[00:33:00] <Cork> there is css, html and js changes
[00:33:24] <tuskkk___> wow
[00:35:21] <Meir`> heh tuskkk___, that's our lovely Cork :)
[00:35:58] <tuskkk___> I wish my brain starts making changes like these in jquery
[00:38:58] <jqueryius> if I have a <td>
[00:39:04] <jqueryius> and I know it has an <i> within it
[00:39:17] <jqueryius> from the td selector, how can I select the <i> ?
[00:51:17] <Meir`> jqueryius: did you try $("td>i") ?
[00:57:56] <Uhkis> $('td').find('i') should work as well
[00:59:20] <Cork> no that isn't the same thing
[00:59:31] <Cork> $('td').children('i') would be though
[00:59:42] <Cork> ah, sorry
[00:59:49] <Cork> > in the selector isn't needed
[01:01:02] <Meir`> tbh, i didn't dig to know the difference b/w "td i" and "td>i"
[01:01:22] <Meir`> Cork, can you please define it for me shortly?
[01:01:38] <Cork> Meir`: > means it will check that the absolute parent is td
[01:01:53] <Cork> while space just checks that "a parent" is
[01:02:39] <Meir`> you mean that with space, the child can be nested severl levels deeper?
[01:02:46] <Meir`> sevaral*
[01:02:51] <Cork> yes
[01:03:16] <Meir`> ok then that's what i assume i think
[01:03:46] <Meir`> so is it correct to say that > is equivalent to .childeren(), and space is equivalent to .find()?
[01:03:54] <Cork> yes
[01:04:00] <Meir`> children*
[01:04:03] <Meir`> ok, thanks :)
[01:04:36] <Meir`> in fact, also after verfying this, i'd answer jqueryius the same answer
[01:04:51] <Meir`> since he said clearly that the <i> is within the <td>
[01:05:17] <Meir`> verifying* damned keyboard >:O
[01:05:17] <Cork> Meir`: ya, but without doesn't mean direct child
[01:05:27] <Cork> uh...
[01:05:32] <Meir`> within * ;)
[01:05:37] <Cork> stupid fingers
[01:05:38] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/weveks9f/25/ I cannot understand why the conditional in linew 31-32 fails
[01:05:48] <Meir`> you blame the fingers, and i blame the keyboard
[01:05:51] <dimi1947> lines 31-32
[01:07:02] <Cork> dimi1947: cache the selectors, don't re run them for every check
[01:07:35] <dimi1947> what do you mean?explain please
[01:08:03] <Cork> var input = $('input[id*='d']');
[01:08:16] <dimi1947> yes...what aboit it?
[01:08:17] <Cork> dimi1947: also stop abusing ids and classes...
[01:08:34] <Cork> basically all your selectors are horrible
[01:08:55] <Cork> 1. don't select on partial id attributes, use a class instead
[01:09:01] <Meir`> dimi1947, also, on line 31, you're selecting 'input'
[01:09:10] <Cork> as what you're doing is throwing away all the browsers optimizations
[01:09:25] <Cork> 2. don't match on partial classes, split the classes into multiple classes instead
[01:09:42] <dimi1947> yes I just saw that on line 31
[01:10:00] <Cork> and ya, finally you check if any input is visible
[01:10:11] <Cork> and that will always be true basically
[01:10:16] <Cork> (so it will always be false)
[01:10:45] <dimi1947> give me a min...you mentioned many things...
[01:10:52] <Cork> but ya.. please fix these 'img[class*="add_"]'
[01:10:58] <Cork> it makes my heart cry...
[01:11:37] <dimi1947> what to do with them...I am confused
[01:11:45] <Uhkis> bad selectors cause internal bleeding, whoa!
[01:11:52] <Uhkis> dimi1947: img.class
[01:12:08] <Cork> dimi1947: the element doesn't exist in the page so kinda hard to say exactly how to fix them
[01:12:16] <Cork> dimi1947: but you should NEVER select on partial classes
[01:12:28] <Cork> instead ex. replace _ with space in the class
[01:12:32] <Cork> and have it become two classes
[01:12:53] <dimi1947> why no partial classes?
[01:13:02] <dimi1947> img.add_  is this better?
[01:13:12] <Cork> cause it means you use the browsers hash table to classes
[01:13:25] <Cork> instead of string matching on every attribute on every img tag in the page
[01:13:45] <dimi1947> yes...but sometimes is usefull
[01:13:55] <Cork> so .class => hash.getElementsByClass('class')
[01:14:18] <dimi1947> cause my DOM has many inputs...and I must differentiate one from the other
[01:14:50] <Cork> img[class*="add_"] => getAllElements('img') *loop* *loop check if it has an class attribute* *loop check the string includes the partial string*
[01:15:04] <Cork> so you effectively make a really fast selector super slow
[01:15:26] <Cork> dimi1947: sure, but use the classes as they where meant to be used and the same thing would work
[01:15:37] <Cork> just without breaking everything
[01:15:39] <dimi1947> so you are saying to use a space istead of an uderscore....?
[01:15:43] <Cork> yes
[01:16:09] <dimi1947> oh....and the reason is the slows down the browser?
[01:16:32] <Cork> the reason is that you are working around all the browsers caches
[01:16:41] <Cork> and these caches is there to speed up finding elements
[01:16:53] <Cork> sure, the page might be small enough for this not to matter
[01:17:07] <Cork> but, you should NEVER do this as a matter of principal
[01:17:07] <dimi1947> why puting an underscore messes with the cache?
[01:17:20] <Cork> cause it means you can't select based on the class
[01:17:27] <Cork> you have to fallback to string match
[01:18:03] <Cork> img "find all elements of type img"
[01:18:10] <dimi1947> ok....
[01:18:19] <Cork> [class] "filter out the img elements that have a class attribute"
[01:18:26] <dimi1947> ok...
[01:18:41] <Cork> *="add_" "search in the attributes value for a partial match matching add_"
[01:18:52] <Cork> instead of "give me all elements with the class add"
[01:19:01] <Shaggoth> I all
[01:19:07] <Cork> or "give me all img elements with the class add"
[01:19:07] <Shaggoth> hi*
[01:19:36] <Cork> the last two is build in hash tables in the browser
[01:19:39] <Cork> so they are really fast
[01:19:42] <dimi1947> bottom line...stop using undserscore
[01:19:48] <Cork> no
[01:19:59] <Cork> bottom line... stop using compound classes
[01:20:10] <Cork> if it is two separate things, have two class names
[01:20:18] <dimi1947> oh....
[01:20:46] <Cork> <elm class="add_remove_button"> $('elm[class*="button"']') => NO
[01:20:55] <dimi1947> insted of class="add_b"  use class="add" class="b"
[01:21:01] <Cork> <elm class="add remove button"> $('elm.add.button') => yes
[01:21:08] <Cork> no in the same attribute
[01:21:31] <Cork> also b should prob not be a class
[01:21:48] <dimi1947> of course it must be sth else
[01:21:52] <Cork> instead you might want to do something like <elm class="add" data-id="b">
[01:22:14] <Cork> or <elm class="add" data-type="b">
[01:22:16] <Cork> or what ever
[01:22:22] <dimi1947> so no underscores and no compund classes
[01:22:33] <Cork> underscores are fine
[01:22:45] <Cork> as long as the class is for a class of elements
[01:22:53] <dimi1947> yes but you told me that they mess with the cache
[01:23:12] <dimi1947> unless you meant the mess with the class when using compund classes
[01:23:18] <dimi1947> cache I meant
[01:23:28] <Cork> dimi1947: what characters you have in the class name doesn't matter
[01:23:35] <dimi1947> ok....
[01:23:39] <Cork> it is when you need to split the class meaning
[01:23:54] <Cork> so you have to use [class*=] instead of the dot notation
[01:23:54] <dimi1947> there is the probel you suggest?
[01:24:21] <Cork> i can't give a specific answer as i don't have what you're suing
[01:24:23] <Cork> *using
[01:24:33] <Cork> update the fiddle if you want an explicit suggestion
[01:29:02] <dimi1947> ok
[01:30:13] <Shaggoth> i have a boostrap row array and i want to search the number of row of each type of class which have a checked chekbox, can someone help me, am i clear ? cause my english is not good as well ?
[01:32:30] <Shaggoth> maybe that can help you understand me https://gist.github.com/Mathieudewet/6841757d48dd2bb8a032
[01:33:11] <Cork> Shaggoth: uh, that's php not js
[01:33:30] <Shaggoth> i wanted to do this in jquery
[01:33:52] <Cork> then that gist won't help
[01:34:38] <Shaggoth> just for see hox i build my array
[01:35:48] <Cork> but the array is in php...
[01:36:10] <Cork> you can't search something that was server side client side
[01:36:24] <Cork> it won't even exist server side anymore when js runs
[01:37:01] <Shaggoth> https://gist.github.com/Mathieudewet/ce51704ec8f35b89586d
[01:37:15] <Shaggoth> look here i do the most part in jquery
[01:38:35] <Shaggoth> all work
[01:38:51] <Shaggoth> i just need to know more about selector
[01:41:03] <Shaggoth> ok nevermind i'll find
[01:46:28] <dimi1947> cork instead of id in the conditional I use classes....it does not wotk though....for a while let us forget the selector issue and just focus in the conditional
[01:47:44] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/weveks9f/32/
[01:49:11] <dimi1947> one is true and the other is false....nothing is printed in the console though
[01:50:59] <Cork> dimi1947: ya, that is what and conditions mean
[01:51:00] <Uhkis> TRUE && FALSE is not TRUE
[01:51:04] <Cork> both have to be true
[01:51:38] <dimi1947> got it...
[01:51:57] <dimi1947> then maybe if I explain what I want to do you could help me
[01:54:23] <dimi1947> simpy stated....suppose we have 3 inputs....2 disabled one non-visible...and when that situation  is true take an action
[01:55:02] <dimi1947> or else the DOM does not have a visible/non-disabled input in it
[01:55:29] <dimi1947> when this condition applies take a specific action
[02:02:22] <guest_002> good day everyone . I have some question in regards with <select> to explain further this is the link of my problem http://pastebin.com/9zLFz7U8. Please help . Thank you
[02:06:10] <Cork> guest_002: what you have to do is on change on one remove that element on the other
[02:06:26] <Cork> (and add back the other ones that you might have removed before)
[02:07:15] <guest_002> cork: i tried to use each() and the remove()
[02:08:16] <guest_002> Cork: the problem is that once i remove some option it will be remove in all select since every select has the same class
[02:08:54] <Cork> guest_002: $('.selectclass').not(this).find('option').remove()
[02:10:07] <guest_002> Cork: Thanks. do you have any idea in adding again ?
[02:10:44] <Cork> that becomes a bit more tricky
[02:11:10] <Cork> cause to start with, you have to know what element you need to add back
[02:11:26] <Cork> and then you have to create that element again (so have a template for it or something like that)
[02:11:34] <Cork> and then loop the select elements and add them back
[02:12:41] <guest_002> Cork: can you give me some sample code ? thank you
[02:13:03] <Cork> guest_002: could you make a working demo of what you're trying to work in in jsfiddle.net?
[02:13:13] <Cork> *work with in*
[02:13:24] <guest_002> Cork: ok please wait
[02:15:02] <guest_002> Cork: this is the link http://jsfiddle.net/kx5rfncx/
[02:15:58] <Cork> (cleaned up, no actual change) http://jsfiddle.net/kx5rfncx/1/
[02:17:03] <Cork> guest_002: just so i know what you're objective is
[02:17:23] <Cork> should the other select elements reset when the elements gets added/removed?
[02:17:47] <Cork> or should the option in them just get removed/added but the selected option remain?
[02:18:38] <guest_002> Cork: the selected option remain in the current select you've change. But it will be removed in the other <select>
[02:18:47] <Cork> sure
[02:19:00] <Cork> but what should happen with the selection made in the other select elements?
[02:19:14] <Cork> (actually i think i just answered my own question)
[02:19:18] <guest_002> Cork: Nothing will happne
[02:19:56] <Cork> guest_002: btw, you should always have a name on you're form fields
[02:20:14] <guest_002> Cork: ok
[02:26:22] <guest_002> Cork: do you have any idea how to do it ?
[02:27:26] <Cork> guest_002: http://jsfiddle.net/kx5rfncx/2/
[02:27:33] <Cork> was working on it :)
[02:29:08] <guest_002> Cork: sorry for that
[02:29:13] <Cork> np
[02:29:58] <guest_002> Cork: Thank you so much
[02:30:17] <guest_002> Cork: its working thank you

[03:03:19] <PCatinean> how do I track all changes for all fields inside a form that have a certa data-xx tag?
[03:08:15] <guest_002> Cork: I have some question in regards with your update . sorry if i disturb you again
[03:16:54] <hrusti> http://jsfiddle.net/LtJLc/53/ How do I stop rotating, set div to default position and scale it?
[03:22:37] <Cork> hrusti: http://jsfiddle.net/LtJLc/54/
[03:22:58] <Cork> guest_002: if you have a question just ask it
[03:23:39] <guest_002> Cork: Ive tried your code.its working in 2 select but when i've 3 or 4 select it wont work as the same .
[03:24:47] <Cork> ah, ya
[03:25:08] <Cork> guest_002: with more it would complex things quite a bit... didn't think of that
[03:25:38] <Cork> guest_002: you would have to collect the values of all the select elements and use that instead of the .not solution :/
[03:26:16] <Cork> PCatinean: $('form[data-xx]]').on('change', ':input', func) ?
[03:27:13] <guest_002> Cork: if its ok, what is the possible jquery function i can use for that ?
[03:27:39] <Cork> guest_002: there isn't one
[03:28:07] <Cork> guest_002: you would have to first loop and grab the current values (you already do this), then loop again and remove all options you have in said list
[03:30:10] <hrusti> Cork: I meant with animate() using ease-out so loading image would stop slowly and scale?
[03:32:11] <guest_002> Cork: sorry , I'm quite confused
[03:34:44] <guest_002> Cork: if its ok can you give me sample code about  it ?
[03:46:26] <dan2k3k4> Is it possible to set height: 95%; /* in case of older browser */ then height: calc(100%-100px); ?
[03:46:31] <dan2k3k4> via jquery...
[03:46:55] <dan2k3k4> $('#elem').css('height', '95%; calc(100%-100px)'); doesn't work
[03:47:13] <dan2k3k4> and doing it via diff .css calls just uses the first .css(height value
[03:47:24] <iaj> Hi there.
[03:48:38] <iaj> Im having a question right now I'm trying to add '&custom=foo' to all my links...  I've been trying this: http://pastebin.com/DdqgC8bQ    But somehow the links get added several ?custom=foo   :(
[03:48:45] <iaj> Is there any easy fix to that?
[03:51:22] <dan2k3k4> can just do .css(height 100%).css(height -=194px)
[03:51:23] <dan2k3k4> and works
[03:55:02] <PCatinean> Cork, will that have compatibility issues?
[04:16:15] <Cork> PCatinean: nope, it would be better to choose to use a class, but that is about it
[04:16:20] <Cork> (or an id)
[04:51:35] <krad> hi.  i have an array of numbers (bytes).  how to send it as raw bytes in $.ajax?
[04:56:26] <Wes-> krad: I would send it as a base64-encoded strings personally
[04:56:40] <DjoCom> hey could anyone help me to programmatically trigger the click , here the jsfiddle link : https://jsfiddle.net/ffa65yba/7/embedded/result/
[04:56:46] <krad> it's not up to me.. i mean the server expects binary data
[04:57:34] <DjoCom> sorry the link is https://jsfiddle.net/ffa65yba/7/
[04:58:14] <Wes-> krad: Really?  That would be pretty unusual for HTTP IME
[04:59:56] <Cork> krad: are you trying to upload a file?
[05:00:27] <Cork> anyway what you want is formData and Blob
[05:00:35] <Cork> ?mdn formData
[05:00:36] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[05:00:39] <Cork> ?mdn blob
[05:00:41] <b-ot> Cork: Blob - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
[05:01:26] <krad> Cork?
[05:01:38] <DjoCom> hey could anyone help me to programmatically trigger the click , here the jsfiddle link : https://jsfiddle.net/ffa65yba/7/#&togetherjs=kL0vHOuSwn
[05:01:45] <krad> Cork, if i have an array of numbers.. how can i tell jquery ajax to send them as raw bytes
[05:01:46] <Cork> DjoCom: you can't programatically click a link
[05:01:53] <krad> $.ajax({ url: getURL(_hash), type: "POST", data: str, success: function(resp, status) { callback(resp, status); }});
[05:01:55] <Cork> krad: i just told you
[05:01:55] <krad> i have this ..
[05:02:11] <Cork> you have to make a blob of the data, and then use formData
[05:02:17] <Cork> then submit the formData object with ajax
[05:02:27] <Wes-> krad: have you seen this? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Sending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data
[05:02:27] <krad> does Blob exist in JavaScript?
[05:02:34] <Cork> yes
[05:02:35] <DjoCom> Cork: ahh sorry i meant button
[05:02:44] <krad> I mean.. in Chrome, if i do new Blob() it works?
[05:02:49] <Cork> DjoCom: what exactly are you trying to do?
[05:02:58] <Cork> krad: yes, but read the documentation
[05:03:10] <Cork> it's more complicated then that
[05:03:24] <Cork> krad: you have to generate a binaryarray
[05:03:33] <Cork> then loop the old array and set those binary values to that array
[05:03:37] <Cork> then create a blob of that array
[05:03:45] <Cork> and then append that blob to the formData
[05:03:52] <Cork> and lastly submit the formData object
[05:04:23] <DjoCom> Cork: i want to make a jquery function  that click a specific button every 3 seconds
[05:04:40] <toomus> Hi all
[05:04:47] <Cork> DjoCom: so you want to fire a js handler or what?
[05:05:08] <Cork> DjoCom: there is way to little info in the fiddle to tell what you're trying to do
[05:05:42] <decx> what was that property to tell if a click is was natural or trigger()'ed?
[05:05:49] <DjoCom> Cork: i will share the work i'm trying to do with you , just go here https://jsfiddle.net/ffa65yba/7/
[05:06:05] <earational> hey
[05:06:16] <decx> oh it was e.originalEvent
[05:06:22] <toomus> I return from server some rendered html element, and I want on client side add some other element to it.
[05:06:38] <Cork> decx: there is isTrusted
[05:06:46] <Cork> ?mdn event.isTrusted
[05:06:46] <b-ot> Cork: Event.isTrusted - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted
[05:07:08] <toomus> eg. $(my_element_from_server).append("<div>OMG</div>");
[05:07:12] <Cork> decx: originalEvent is just jquerys creation, and doesn't guarantee it isn't generated
[05:07:23] <toomus> but this doesn't work
[05:07:24] <decx> well this is in a jquery context
[05:07:42] <decx> originalEvent is probably just using isTrusted in the back?
[05:07:49] <Cork> decx: originalEvent is just the object $.Event got
[05:07:57] <Cork> doesn't mean it isn't triggered
[05:08:17] <Cork> .trigger(event) would create event.originalEvent
[05:08:25] <decx> does it?
[05:08:30] <Cork> ya
[05:08:39] <decx> i was sure i used it for that
[05:08:43] <Cork> it isn't
[05:08:50] <Cork> it is to get access to the original event object
[05:08:55] <Cork> like that name states
[05:08:59] <decx> ^^
[05:09:23] <Cork> but event.originalEvent.isTrusted == true
[05:09:25] <krad> Cork, can you help me with this process
[05:09:29] <Cork> ALWAYS means it isn't triggered
[05:09:41] <krad> my array of numbers is ubArr
[05:10:04] <krad> i loop through it for (var item in ubArr) {		} then do what?
[05:10:07] <Cork> krad: it is quite a bit of work
[05:10:15] <Cork> and i can't put that in right now
[05:10:23] <Cork> but look on mdn they have examples
[05:10:52] <Cork> ?g javascript generate blob from array
[05:10:53] <b-ot> Cork: Blob - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
[05:10:56] <Cork> hmm
[05:11:16] <krad> blob or arraybuffer?
[05:11:58] <toomus> Hey why append() doesn't work in this example? http://pastie.org/private/ap5vjuyfawcostmg0jefrg
[05:12:10] <Cork> krad: you have to use arraybuffer to convert the array
[05:12:23] <Cork> krad: then you have to create a blob based on the array buffer
[05:12:34] <Cork> and then you can append that blob to the formData object
[05:12:53] <krad> var myArray = new ArrayBuffer(512); 	for (var item in ubArr) { 			myArray.push(ubArr[item]);		}
[05:12:54] <krad> like that?
[05:13:02] <krad> .push?
[05:13:08] <Cork> toomus: most likely cause on of the .find doesn't find anything
[05:13:25] <Cork> krad: not for in
[05:13:29] <Cork> never ever use for in on an array
[05:13:58] <krad> 		var myArray = new ArrayBuffer(512);		for (var i=0; i< ubArr.length; i++) {			myArray.push(ubArr[item]);		}
[05:13:59] <Cork> either arr.forEach or for(var i = 0;i < arr.length;i++) {}
[05:14:15] <krad> myArray.push(ubArr[i]);
[05:14:21] <krad> ok what do i do next?
[05:14:33] <krad> can I set ArrayBuffer's size of ubArr's size?
[05:14:37] <krad> instead of 512?
[05:14:51] <Cork> ... i've told you twice, i won't tell every step over and over again
[05:14:53] <krad> ubArr is an Array of numbers
[05:18:40] <toomus> Cork: I print result of find(), and it works
[05:18:51] <krad> Cork, i have an ArrayBuffer now.  how do i get a Blob out of it?
[05:19:37] <Cork> toomus: ah, i missed something in you're code
[05:20:43] <Cork> toomus: what you do is: 1. you grab this_box; 2. you parse the html msg into a dom fragment; 3. you search in this object to find .content; 4. you append WTF; 5. you throw away the object
[05:20:59] <Cork> 6. you find .messages in $this_box; 7. you append the original html
[05:21:14] <krad> Cork, jquery is giving me illegal invocation now ..
[05:21:15] <Cork> toomus: so where things goes wrong is when you do $(msg)
[05:21:55] <Cork> toomus: so do var domMsg = $(msg); domMsg.find()...; append(domMsg)
[05:22:53] <krad> var myArray = new ArrayBuffer(512); for (var i=0; i< ubArr.length; i++) { myArray[i] = ubArr[i]; } 		$.ajax({ url: getURL(_hash), type: "POST", 	data: new Blob([myArray]), contentType: "text/plain", success: callback);
[05:22:58] <krad> that's my code ..
[05:23:34] <toomus> Cork: <3 :)
[05:24:45] <Cork> krad: read through what i said again
[05:24:50] <Cork> you've skipped steps
[05:25:49] <beasty> var monthlyGreeting = "hi Cork o/";
[05:26:51] <krad> var myArray = new ArrayBuffer(512); for (var i=0; i< ubArr.length; i++) { myArray[i] = ubArr[i]; } 		var blobz = new Blob([myArray]); var fd = new FormData(); fd.append('data', blobz);
[05:26:56] <krad> is my FormData object ready now?
[05:31:38] <flobin> does something like jslint for jquery exist?
[05:38:06] <flobin> jshint apparently
[05:57:58] <notchris> Morning!
[05:58:54] <Wes-> sup, yo?
[05:59:59] <notchris> Wes-: Working on a meteor app / drinking coffee ^^

[06:00:39] <Wes-> trying to style chosen to look like I want / drinking coffee :)
[06:13:37] <troop> hello, how can i validate form before submit in validation engine, because when form is submitting validation engine needs return back json data
[06:13:55] <troop> but my submit form will send to register page then redirect home page if user is registered properly
[06:25:47] <VanReyes> Evening
[06:26:02] <VanReyes> How can I go to a url after onchange event
[06:26:21] <VanReyes> My code is not working.
[06:26:37] <VanReyes> $('.change').on('change', function(){
[06:26:47] <VanReyes> window.location.href == "google.com";
[06:26:50] <VanReyes> });
[06:30:10] <VanReyes> Anyone?
[06:35:57] <troop> whats the 200 ajax parseerror ?
[06:48:00] <Cork> troop: parsererror means the server send a response jquery can't parse
[06:48:11] <Cork> troop: for example a json string that is invalid
[06:49:52] <troop> thanks Cork
[06:50:55] <Sal> hey guys, i need a structural help
[06:51:50] <notchris> Sal: #architecture
[06:51:55] <notchris> jk, what’s up?
[06:52:07] <Sal> i have many little functions that, if i was in another language, i would put in many small files for better maintenance
[06:52:41] <Sal> but, i'm in js, so i have to put them all in one file , unless i want the client to make multiple server calls,
[06:53:00] <Sal> whats the best way to separate these parts?
[06:53:02] <Cork> Sal: you could do that, and just use a server side script/cache that concats them all into one file
[06:53:21] <Sal> Cork, ?
[06:53:22] <Cork> and then you serve that file in production
[06:53:39] <Sal> you mean that php should append them all and send them to the client?
[06:53:42] <Cork> cat scripts/*.js > scripts.js
[06:53:44] <Cork> for example
[06:54:10] <Cork> Sal: yes you could do it with php too
[06:54:15] <Sal> but i saw that many use (function.....
[06:54:18] <Cork> though you prob want to write the file statically
[06:54:20] <Sal> whats that?
[06:54:23] <Cork> and have it check if it needs to update
[06:54:36] <Cork> that's self executed functions
[06:54:42] <Cork> also called scopes
[06:54:46] <Sal> and aint that a good way to keep pieces separated and grouped at the same time?
[06:54:50] <Cork> it just creates a namespace for variables and functions
[06:55:08] <Cork> Sal: depends on what you're trying to do
[06:55:17] <Cork> if you want to separate the namescopes sure
[06:55:30] <Cork> if you want to separate them for manageability then no
[06:55:37] <Sal> now, i have all functions inside 1 big file, and i separate parts using comments
[06:55:50] <Cork> ya, so instead have them as separate files
[06:55:52] <Sal> i was just wondering if there's a better way to keep code
[06:56:01] <Cork> and when you want to push it to the server generate a compact file
[06:56:17] <Cork> you could even have the script remove commends, linebreaks and so on to save space (minify)
[06:56:29] <Cork> ?g js minification
[06:56:30] <b-ot> Cork: Minify Javascript Online / Online JavaScript Packer → http://jscompress.com/
[06:56:39] <Sal> jquery has no include, right?
[06:56:47] <Cork> that would be client side
[06:56:53] <Cork> so wouldn't prevent what you want to avoid
[06:57:04] <Sal> ok
[06:57:07] <Cork> to avoid that you have to do it server side
[06:57:39] <Cork> either before you upload it (pre) or have the server do it for you
[06:57:50] <Cork> (cache/live)
[06:58:02] <Sal> ok, thanks
[06:58:50] <Sal> cork, how do you organize your code?
[06:58:55] <Sal> 1 big file?
[06:58:57] <Cork> no
[06:59:04] <Sal> require?
[06:59:13] <Cork> kinda
[06:59:22] <Cork> depends on what backend i use
[06:59:27] <Sal> hmm, so you prefer the client request
[06:59:40] <Cork> in rails they have a require system so i just use that
[06:59:50] <Cork> else i use cat *.js > result.js
[07:00:05] <Cork> Sal: i only serve a few files to the client
[07:00:12] <Cork> 2-3 max
[07:00:31] <Sal> yes, thats what i want to do
[07:00:37] <Sal> less files as possible
[07:00:42] <Cork> and those are usually one big, and 1-2 exceptions
[07:00:47] <Sal> less client requests
[07:00:50] <Cork> ya
[07:01:00] <Sal> the lines here in italy sux
[07:01:04] <Cork> but that doesn't mean you have to develop with that :)
[07:01:35] <Sal> ok, thanks
[07:01:44] <Sal> let me work on it
[07:02:04] <Sal> maybe, calling a php script passing it the files i want to upload
[07:02:12] <Sal> ops, download
[07:02:42] <Sal> hey, but will this mess up all my chrome debugging?
[07:02:58] <Cork> Sal: it will reference to the one big file
[07:03:05] <Cork> you could create a .map file
[07:03:13] <Cork> but then it becomes a bit more complicated to maintain
[07:03:28] <Sal> and what about chacing?
[07:03:34] <Sal> cache
[07:03:35] <Sal> sorry
[07:03:51] <t4nk246> hi all how can I select an A element in an previous LI element?
[07:03:51] <Sal> the browser will always cache the .php file
[07:03:54] <Cork> well the php script could check if the file exist and just serve that
[07:03:58] <Cork> and if it doesn't generate it
[07:04:09] <Cork> then you could remove that file as you upload updates
[07:04:17] <Cork> or have it recreate it every x minutes
[07:04:21] <Cork> (or something like that)
[07:04:38] <Sal> oh, so you mean, anyway generate the cat out put on disk
[07:04:43] <Sal> and then return that?
[07:04:55] <t4nk246> i was trying this but, this doesnt work : $('#navlist > li.current').prev().next('a')
[07:05:45] <Sal> instead pof nect('a') try find('a')
[07:08:28] <t4nk246> TX! Sal <3
[07:14:24] <PCatinean> One can use the jquery validator in production, sell and distribute since it's MIT liscence I assume
[07:17:16] <d0de> I'm trying to integrate some jquery with some django/python. Say that '{% template_tag %}' is a multi-line html snippet. Is there a way I can inject this with jquery / javascript?
[07:17:41] <d0de> as in, use {% template_tag %} in the <script> tag and be able to do stuff with it
[07:18:11] <Cork> d0de: sure, if you want to inject it into js you have to \n escape it
[07:18:20] <Cork> if you send it as a http response it would just work
[07:18:39] <Cork> or you could inject it into a <script type="text/template"></script>
[07:18:53] <d0de> oh, that sounds interesting!
[07:19:16] <d0de> I have literally never heard of that :) I will read up about it, thanks Cork
[07:20:18] <Cork> d0de: <script id="my-template" type="text/template">content</script> templateEngine($('#my-template').html())
[07:33:25] <jkt> hi there, what happens if I $.when($.getJSON(url).done(requestHandler), everythingDone) ? My expectation would be to see requestHandler called first and only then the everythingDone, but my (a bit more involved) example runs the outer $.when first for some reason
[07:34:28] <jkt> full code is available at http://ci-logs.kde.flaska.net/matrix.html
[07:37:37] <Cork> jkt: deferred call in order they where bound, so ya it should be requestHandler followed by everythingDone
[07:38:13] <Cork> ah,wait no
[07:38:19] <Cork> jkt: the syntax is wrong
[07:38:35] <Cork> jkt: $.when() takes deferres as arguments
[07:38:43] <Cork> so the second function gets executed directly
[07:38:55] <Cork> what you want is ($.getJSON(url).done(requestHandler)).done(everythingDone)
[07:39:03] <Cork> what you want is opps$.getJSON(url).done(requestHandler)).done(everythingDone)
[07:39:04] <Cork> BAH
[07:39:12] <Cork> $.when($.getJSON(url).done(requestHandler)).done(everythingDone)
[07:39:14] <Cork> there
[07:39:26] <Cork> or just straight $.getJSON(url).done(requestHandler).done(everythingDone)
[07:39:40] <jkt> Cork: my minimal example actually work as I expect them to work, so I must be making something stupid somewhere else
[07:40:10] <Cork> jkt: $.when ever takes callbacks
[07:40:16] <Cork> *never
[07:40:22] * Cork pokes his head
[07:41:22] <jkt> Cork: I'm firing multiple ajax requests from a for loop, so I'm storing the result of $.getJSON(url).done(callback) into an array
[07:41:31] <jkt> Cork: and when these all are saved, I call $.wait(myarray)
[07:41:44] <Cork> you mean .when
[07:41:51] <jkt> right
[07:42:00] <Cork> and it expects $.when.apply(null, myarray)
[07:43:29] * jkt ponders *how* this is inmplemented inside :)
[07:43:48] <Cork> jkt: $.when expects $.when(deferred,deferred,deferred,deferred,deferred,deferred)
[07:43:56] <Cork> .apply is a built in javascript method
[07:44:30] <Cork> it converts func.apply(this_object, [1,2,3,4,5]) into func(1,2,3,4,5)
[07:44:39] <Cork> with this_object as the "this" variable inside the function
[07:44:57] <jkt> Cork: so it's "just" for calling $.wait(array[i]) for all items in array?
[07:45:17] <Cork> $.when not $.wait
[07:45:28] <Cork> and no $.when takes multiple arguments
[07:45:55] <jkt> yes, sorry about that, I keep writing "wait" for some reason
[07:45:55] <Cork> and it then loops over those arguments and binds all the callbacks and then fire its own callback when all of them has fired
[07:45:56] <obert> $.walt.disney?
[07:46:48] <eber> Hey guys, I need to reliably send messages from a window to an iframe (that might be in a different domain) and was thinking about using plain and simple Window.postMessage() but I just saw that IE doesn't support it that well, but it does support MessageChannel (which Firefox won't support without enabling it manually). So, do you guys any libs or plugins that can "abstract" that kind of interaction? And fallback to one or another methods?
[07:47:18] <Cork> so it is basically var c = $.Deferred(); var all = arguments.length; for(var i = 0; arguments.length;i++) { arguments[i].done(countdown_and_fire_when_all_is_0) } return c }
[07:47:31] <Cork> psudo code :)
[07:48:33] <Cork> jkt: if you ware interested http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.when
[07:48:37] <jkt> Cork: right, thanks for your explanation; I got confused by that array-of-Deferred vs. multiple-Deferred-arguments
[07:49:11] <Cork> specifically: if (! (--remaining)) { deferred.resolveWith(contexts, values); }
[07:59:25] <Es0teric> anyone here use fullpagejs?
[07:59:59] <jak2000> hi all, i have this: var bla = $('input:radio[name=xTipoMov]:checked').val();   (have 3 radios, same name), but the result is on always, how to get the radio selected? thanks
[08:03:39] <gambl0re> what is the .click() equivalent css selector?
[08:04:31] <notchris> gambl0re: :active ?
[08:04:34] <notchris> :focus?
[08:06:10] <gambl0re> i think focus works on input elements
[08:06:39] <gambl0re> i want to make a div element to transition its size when clicked. but i dont want to use jquery
[08:08:21] <jak2000> solved, thanks, gambl0re
[08:08:44] <gambl0re> what?
[08:08:54] <gambl0re> i didnt solve anything..
[08:12:31] <Es0teric> anyone here use fullpagejs?
[08:16:19] <Wes-> Hi, I am using select2 4.0 - I am trying to put the inserted DOM nodes in a different place via the dropdownParent option, but when I do, it calculates the position incorrectly (seems to set left: and top: with values that are screen-relative instead of containers bounding client rect-relative).  Does anyone know a way to fix this easily?
[08:17:57] <Es0teric> if anyone here uses fullpagejs and twitter bootstrap i have this problem http://puu.sh/ijC1h/cb3e9a69fe.png its pushing the section content to the right
[08:23:49] <feathersanddown> how is called the image beside first letter of a paragraf?
[08:23:49] <dimi1947> how am I going to check if an anput element exists in a page....ready for editing....?
[08:24:01] <dimi1947> it non-disabled
[08:24:14] <dimi1947> it is non-disabled
[08:26:53] <jak2000> initially i have: <thead><th width="5%">Type</th><th width="5%">Qty</th></thead> the suer fill the radio, and input and click on Add button, and add the row, but i am never add <tbody> and </tbody> how to check if exist a <tbody> and </tbody> before add the row: by sample: $('#myTable').append('<tr><td>my data</td><td>more data</td></tr>');
[08:27:24] <robertmaxrees> you can check if ($('#myTable tbody').length) {}
[08:28:11] <jak2000> if tbody is empty wich is the result?
[08:28:29] <robertmaxrees> do you want to know if tbody exists or if it has any children?
[08:28:40] <decx> what if it doesnt exist?
[08:28:44] <decx> append to the table?
[08:28:46] <jak2000> if exists
[08:28:56] <jak2000> check i have only:
[08:29:03] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 do you have a fiddle?
[08:29:07] <jak2000> <thead><th width="5%">Type</th><th width="5%">Qty</th></thead>
[08:29:12] <jak2000> ok, wait, making
[08:32:17] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/
[08:32:29] <jak2000> no tbody here
[08:32:36] <robertmaxrees> there's no radio there.
[08:32:37] <robertmaxrees> *table
[08:32:42] <robertmaxrees> so you want to create a table?
[08:33:05] <jak2000> here exist a table
[08:33:10] <jak2000> defined in the jsfiddle
[08:33:11] <jak2000> seE?
[08:33:18] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle you linked does not contain a table.
[08:33:39] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/l50Pba8.png no tables here.  just inputs.
[08:34:49] <jak2000> ok see
[08:34:50] <jak2000> wait error
[08:36:03] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/1/
[08:36:04] <jak2000> now?
[08:36:12] <robertmaxrees> there's the table.
[08:36:31] <jak2000> ok :)
[08:36:33] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, use what i showed you earlier.
[08:36:34] <jak2000> see no tbody here
[08:37:09] <robertmaxrees> though you really should have a tbody by default.
[08:37:39] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees,when you are ready I need your help on something
[08:37:46] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 just ask the channel.
[08:37:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm not the only person available to help ;)
[08:38:34] <Synthead> can I build a new dictionary using jquery kinda like ruby's Hash.new.tap?  like $.map, but I want to create a dictionary instead
[08:38:46] <robertmaxrees> Synthead not really.
[08:39:12] <robertmaxrees> and you'd use javascript to do it, not jquery
[08:39:13] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: ok, no biggie.  I'll just declare it and add attributes to it
[08:39:19] <robertmaxrees> *properties :)
[08:39:26] <Synthead> ah, yeah
[08:39:26] <robertmaxrees> javascript doesn't have hashes or dictionaries ;)
[08:39:32] <dimi1947> I am facing a logic problem...
[08:39:38] <Synthead> I know... it's just so ambiguous to call it an "object"
[08:39:53] <robertmaxrees> not in JS :)
[08:40:07] <hlvwrk> hey dudes
[08:40:13] <robertmaxrees> we know what you mean if you're not more specific, Synthead
[08:40:22] <Synthead> what about an array?  it's an object too
[08:40:34] <robertmaxrees> so are functions.
[08:40:40] <robertmaxrees> but you don't refer to arrays as objects.
[08:40:42] <Synthead> bleh, that's what I'm saying
[08:40:43] <robertmaxrees> you call them arrays :)
[08:40:48] <robertmaxrees> same with functions.
[08:40:54] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees, when would $("#"). actually work?
[08:40:59] <hlvwrk> What is that a selector to?
[08:41:02] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk it wouldn't.
[08:41:04] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/3/
[08:41:06] <jak2000> like you?
[08:41:14] <Synthead> same for dictionaries, though, right?  they're all objects, but we call them other things to differentiate them
[08:41:23] <Synthead> at least that's how I understand it :)
[08:41:23] <robertmaxrees> Synthead in javascript, they're not really dictionaries.
[08:41:26] <robertmaxrees> they're just objects.
[08:41:39] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you could also just do http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8p2mu7vs/4/
[08:41:46] <dimi1947> I have a pages with 5 inputs 3 disabled and 2 hidden.....how am I going to test that the page DOES NOT have an input ready for typing/editing?
[08:41:51] <hlvwrk> what if i said it was...?
[08:41:51] <hlvwrk> o_O
[08:42:02] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk make a fiddle and show what you're seeing.
[08:48:32] <jak2000> robertmaxrees wich properties have a cell (on a table)?
[08:50:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:51:50] <jak2000> by sample in pascal (fill a grid) grid.cell[1,1].asstring:='Hi'; but you too this cell[1,1] have a object propertie. understand?
[08:52:19] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[08:52:25] <robertmaxrees> no clue what you're trying to say.
[08:53:15] <jak2000> ok, in other words:
[08:55:20] <jak2000> i have a catalog of fruits: 1,Apple  2,orange  3, grape    in the html table  you display Apple, orange, grape right?   but i am interested for programming purposses the id, where put the id on a cell?
[08:55:23] <jak2000> understand ?
[08:56:36] <jak2000> of course id is a id of mysql table
[08:56:47] <robertmaxrees> you could make it the id of the cell.
[08:56:51] <robertmaxrees> id="whatever"
[08:57:56] <dimi1947> is there any way i can modify the name of a variable....meaning varname+idname for example?
[08:58:56] <jak2000> robertmaxrees can you give me a link (please) for read and understand more about cells?
[09:02:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:02:58] <jak2000> tbody.append('<tr><td id='+weos+'>'+wauxes+'</td><td id='+wtipo+'>'+wauxtipo+'</td></tr>');
[09:02:59] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what are you trying to understand.
[09:03:00] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 nope.
[09:03:11] <jak2000> where weos=1 and wtipo=54
[09:03:34] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what you just pasted should work.
[09:03:47] <dimi1947> thanks fro telling robertmaxrees
[09:04:17] <jak2000> robertmaxrees finally i add rows with id... when i post i want know the id, for store on a database, understand my final task?
[09:05:23] <zzaichik> jak2000: http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/fundamentals/the-human-body/cells
[09:06:41] <jak2000> zzaichik thanks
[09:06:47] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[09:06:53] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 is this via ajax oooor....?
[09:07:23] <zzaichik> haha - anytime
[09:15:46] <zzaichik> $('td'/this).attr('id'); type of deal
[09:28:14] <d0de> The solution you suggested worked very well. Thanks Cork!
[09:38:54] <molgrum> hi, is there any way to call a function _after_ the submit form has been initialized? i've googled like crazy about this and nobody seems to need to ask this
[09:39:10] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[09:39:20] <robertmaxrees> like, after the form exists on the page?
[09:39:41] <molgrum> robertmaxrees: after the sumbit button has been pressed and the user is redirected
[09:40:08] <robertmaxrees> your server would need to put in a function call or something similar.
[09:40:26] <robertmaxrees> javascript doesn't carry from page to page.
[09:40:39] <randomguy1> or maybe a localStorage flag?  i'm assuming by redirected he's talking about a page transition
[09:40:55] <molgrum> well it's the same page, it's just uploading
[09:41:06] <robertmaxrees> is it via ajax then?
[09:41:14] <robertmaxrees> because that's WAY different.
[09:42:30] <molgrum> robertmaxrees: not ajax, i don't think so
[09:42:38] <randomguy1> you'd know if it was, :)
[09:42:42] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:42:53] <robertmaxrees> oh you're doing a postback.
[09:43:05] <molgrum> i'm lousy with terms :)
[09:43:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd have the page include the function call or some other marker saying as much.
[09:43:49] <robertmaxrees> you need to supply some kind of state it can read.
[09:45:04] <molgrum> well the problem is, all the options are "before submit", so that's where i'm stuck
[09:45:11] <WhereIsMySpoon> Is there some way with a css selector to select using style attributes like visibility and so on?
[09:45:14] <molgrum> like onsubmit and so on
[09:45:19] <robertmaxrees> molgrum huh?
[09:45:25] <robertmaxrees> WhereIsMySpoon nope.
[09:45:30] <WhereIsMySpoon> oh, bum
[09:45:32] <WhereIsMySpoon> ok
[09:45:53] <WhereIsMySpoon> thanks :P
[09:46:44] <molgrum> robertmaxrees: i've tried various approaches, both with normal js and with jquery but they all execute when the button is pressed... i need it to execute after the page transition
[09:48:29] <molgrum> basically it's going to enable the "would you like to leave this page?"
[09:49:31] <randomguy1> they'er on one of your pages, submit, arrive on another of your pages and are immediately asked if they want to leave?
[09:49:36] <jak2000> robertmaxrees wich programming language do you use? java? php? c#?
[09:50:15] <molgrum> randomguy1: nono, the page is the same, it's just going to upload stuff
[09:50:30] <molgrum> that's why i want it to ask, because of the uploading
[09:51:41] <randomguy1> well, with a postback one way would be to return any input you need on the following page as hidden variables, along with another field that lets the following page know it needs to execute some function on document ready if that element exists
[09:52:27] <molgrum> ah right, i forgot about hidden variables
[09:52:33] <molgrum> maybe that will work
[09:52:50] <randomguy1> if you don't want a ton of hidden variables you could use data elements too
[09:53:24] <molgrum> isn't just one variable enough? like isProcessing
[09:54:01] <randomguy1> i'm referring to something like <span id="performXAction" data-firstName="Jimmy" data-lastName="Dean"></span>
[09:54:20] <robertmaxrees> molgrum i feel like there's a basic disconnect here.
[09:54:35] <robertmaxrees> you said you want to do something after you submit the form, right?
[09:54:46] <molgrum> i'm totally fresh with js so i donẗ blame you
[09:55:05] <robertmaxrees> molgrum try to describe the end result you're looking for.
[09:55:17] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 mostly javascript.  at my work we use java and coldfusion (yuck)
[09:55:30] <robertmaxrees> java's okay.  we're trying to transition off of CF.
[09:55:32] <molgrum> robertmaxrees: yes, i want to set window.onbeforeunload=goodbye
[09:55:56] <molgrum> and goodbye is the function that asks if they want to leave
[09:56:03] <robertmaxrees> molgrum hold up - instead of describing what you think you want from a technological perspective, describe what you want from a UX perspective :)
[09:56:29] <molgrum> hmm :)
[09:56:43] <molgrum> user experience you mean?
[09:56:43] <randomguy1> i am a user... i do X and I see Y happen
[09:56:50] <robertmaxrees> you want to display a confirmation dialog after the user subbmits the form?
[09:57:35] <molgrum> robertmaxrees: well, when the user submits the form, it uploads the chosen media. if they close the window i want it to ask if they're sure they want to quit
[09:57:44] <robertmaxrees> why?
[09:57:51] <randomguy1> jak2000: did you have a question?
[09:58:49] <molgrum> robertmaxrees: because uploading 99% of a gigabyte and accidentally closing the tab maybe :)
[09:59:06] <robertmaxrees> molgrum in that case, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1119289/how-to-show-the-are-you-sure-you-want-to-navigate-away-from-this-page-when-ch
[10:02:24] <molgrum> robertmaxrees: okay i will dig into this some more, thanks for your patience
[10:10:49] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[10:12:37] <randomguy1> mm?
[10:23:43] <Voyage_> is v2.x better and should be used or 1.x?
[10:23:50] <robertmaxrees> not that simple :)
[10:24:08] <robertmaxrees> 1.x and 2.x have the exact same features - depends on what browsers you need to support.
[10:24:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[10:30:50] <Voyage_> robertmaxrees,  thanks. other than support. whats the difference?
[10:31:03] <Voyage_> can anyone help  me out here for a simple script? https://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/4/
[10:33:12] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ that's the difference.
[10:33:16] <robertmaxrees> browser support.
[10:34:03] <robertmaxrees> and you don't need script tags in jsfiddle.
[10:34:15] <robertmaxrees> have you been over learn.jquery.com yet?
[10:45:34] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10234022  <--- in lines 242 to 254 i add 2 rows dinamically, here the image: http://postimg.org/image/y35m9ufwb/  my question is, when i post the page, how to obtain/get the values of the Table?  (i think need iterate, and too need rename as an array thecells on the table any advice?
[10:45:49] <robertmaxrees> "lines 242 to 254"
[10:45:53] <robertmaxrees> thats a lot of code.
[10:46:49] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[10:47:51] <robertmaxrees> also: what format do you need?
[10:48:10] <acidjazz> < also> ALL THE FORMATS
[10:48:13] <acidjazz> see my joke
[10:48:13] <acidjazz> see
[10:48:35] <robertmaxrees> lel
[10:51:28] <Voyage_> robertmaxrees,  hm
[10:52:36] <robertmaxrees> what?
[10:52:45] <Voyage_> robertmaxrees,  so regardless of browsers, we should choose jquery 2.x as its latest and better?
[10:53:26] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ no.
[10:53:28] <robertmaxrees> again.
[10:53:39] <robertmaxrees> the only difference between the 2.x series and the 1.x series are the browsers they support.
[10:53:46] <robertmaxrees> they have the exact same features/fixes/etc.
[10:54:13] <Voyage_> robertmaxrees,  then why use 2? if for 1.x we get same thing but more browser support
[10:54:20] <robertmaxrees> smaller file.
[10:54:31] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need to support older browsers, why make your users download a bigger file?
[10:54:40] <Voyage_> ok. what else?
[10:54:54] <robertmaxrees> that's the entire reason.
[10:55:01] <Voyage_> can anyone help  me out here for a simple script? https://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/4/
[10:55:09] <Voyage_> robertmaxrees,  ok
[10:55:11] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ we're not going ot do it for you.
[10:55:11] <Voyage_> thanks
[10:55:14] <robertmaxrees> we'll help you do it.
[10:55:15] <Es0teric> anyone here used fullpagejs?
[10:55:16] <zzaichik> @Voyage_ to get you started. https://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/5/
[10:55:25] <zzaichik> could probably be simplified a bit
[10:55:27] <robertmaxrees> err.
[10:55:35] <zzaichik> I'm sorry - I had some free time
[10:55:35] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/5/
[10:55:37] <Voyage_> :) zzzgeoffb  thanks
[10:55:42] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#giving-good-answers
[10:55:58] <jak2000> click on ADD button if you see, i add 3fruits, each on with an id.. see?
[10:56:02] <robertmaxrees> zzaichik ^ doing it for them kind of skirts the problem :)
[10:56:19] <zzaichik> I know..
[10:56:29] <robertmaxrees> zzaichik then why do it for them?
[10:56:32] <zzaichik> bad form
[10:56:34] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 sure.
[10:57:06] <zzaichik> I was bored
[10:57:09] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[10:57:18] <robertmaxrees> just teaches people to copy/paste instead of learn to code.
[10:57:32] <zzaichik> I had some time to kill. I'll be more diligent in the future. :)
[10:57:38] <zzaichik> to NOT do that.
[10:57:42] <jak2000> ok, my question is: when i do the post, print_r.jsp page, how to know the values of the table, of each cell?
[10:57:55] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:58:10] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you have them by default.
[10:58:58] <Voyage_> zzaichik,  if I comment the first line, I get NaN despite I put only numerices
[10:59:02] <robertmaxrees> your server will get all that data already, jak2000
[10:59:26] <zzaichik> Voyage_: those inputs have no value to begin with.
[10:59:50] <zzaichik> Or, their value isn't a number that can be used to add.
[11:00:02] <zzaichik> Which is why I gave it one.
[11:00:17] <Voyage_> hm
[11:03:48] <zzaichik> What I did there was just a lot of the stuff you'd need in order to make it work. You'll have to actually make it fit your needs. You wanted it to add when the checkbox is checked right? I didn't that part for you. But you have a good amount to look at there.
[11:04:02] <robertmaxrees> zzaichik++
[11:04:36] <Es0teric> anyone here use fullpagejs? because i am having a problem where the first section is not showing and the sections below it keep getting pushed down as if there is a margin on them
[11:04:36] <Voyage_> how to check if a value of string is a number?
[11:04:52] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ you could use a regex, parseFloat, parseInt...
[11:04:54] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices.
[11:05:10] <Voyage_> no ".isNumber" ?
[11:05:18] <robertmaxrees> for strings?
[11:05:32] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:05:46] <Voyage_> isNaN(num)     // returns true if the variable does NOT contain a valid number
[11:06:01] <Voyage_> isNaN(123)       // false
[11:06:09] <Voyage_> isNaN('foo')     // true
[11:06:15] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN#Confusing_special-case_behavior
[11:06:21] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use isNaN
[11:06:29] <Es0teric> also i am talking about this: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/
[11:06:54] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ i'd do an explicit check.
[11:08:07] <randomguy1> weird, i was disconnected i guess.  anyway.  anyone have a favorite site to visit to see the latest numbers regarding the most popular desktop resolutions?
[11:08:23] <robertmaxrees> randomguy1 sure - your own analytics suite.
[11:08:47] <Voyage_> hm nic
[11:08:50] <Voyage_> hm nice
[11:09:00] <IAmMe643> does asyone on here have experience with jscroll? It is an infinaste scroler and it is killing the next btton, thus only allowing for one more page to load.
[11:09:12] <randomguy1> heh, don't currently have one.  i traditionally go small
[11:09:13] <robertmaxrees> !ask
[11:09:13] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:09:20] <robertmaxrees> ^ IAmMe643
[11:09:24] <robertmaxrees> randomguy1 you should have one.
[11:09:30] <robertmaxrees> even just google analytics.
[11:09:51] <IAmMe643> robertmaxrees: I did ask it.
[11:10:12] <IAmMe643> jscroll is killing the next btton, thus only allowing for one more page to load.
[11:10:13] <robertmaxrees> IAmMe643 with the given inforamtion, how are we supposed to help?
[11:10:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:10:36] <IAmMe643> robertmaxrees: if you knew jScroll you might knowe what is causing it,
[11:11:00] <robertmaxrees> IAmMe643 or you could shopw us an example of it breaking and we can help you there?
[11:11:09] <jak2000> anyone worked with jsp(java)?
[11:11:17] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 not the right place for that :)
[11:11:37] <IAmMe643> robertmaxrees: unfortuately I cannot as I am using it on a school site.
[11:12:13] <robertmaxrees> err, okay.

[11:12:18] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[11:12:22] <robertmaxrees> ^ check this out then.
[11:14:32] <Voyage_> whats wrong with line 22 zzaichik  https://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/7/
[11:14:55] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ don't use isNaN here.
[11:15:23] <Voyage_> ya, I understand isNaN("37");      // false: "37" is converted to the number 37 which is not NaN
[11:15:24] <Voyage_> but its ok
[11:15:25] <robertmaxrees> also you've got an extra closing paren and you're using isNaN on the wrong object.
[11:16:16] <IAmMe643> robertmaxrees: ok. I think I narrowed down he problem (from the plugin's documentation). It ;atches onto a button and if it has an href it will count it and load the page. if it does not, it will self destruct. apparently it is doing both.
[11:16:22] <Voyage_> wronge object? robertmaxrees
[11:16:29] <Voyage_> fixed perentheses
[11:16:42] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ right - if you read learn.jquery.com you'd know what $(this) is
[11:17:37] <Voyage_> $this is the var that is in question. this case,         $('.price input') which is under loop
[11:18:04] <Voyage_> I just checked its value
[11:18:12] <Voyage_>  if($(this).val().isNaN()){$(this).val(0)}
[11:18:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[11:18:28] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[11:18:33] <Voyage_> ($this) is the var that is in question. this case,         $('.price input') which is under loop
[11:18:37] <spottieOttie> robert you know what want from you
[11:18:38] <robertmaxrees> .isNaN() isn't what you want here.
[11:18:41] <spottieOttie> I want from you
[11:18:58] <spottieOttie> I want a SONG
[11:19:02] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[11:19:45] <spottieOttie> what do you got
[11:19:48] <spottieOttie> yarrrr
[11:20:27] <robertmaxrees> hurr hurr
[11:20:50] <spottieOttie> give me a jam nigga
[11:20:58] <Voyage_> why isnt this working? $('.price input').each(function() {
[11:20:58] <Voyage_>             alert($(this).val);
[11:21:39] <robertmaxrees> spottieOttie not okay
[11:21:56] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ please go read the tutorial on learn.jquery.com
[11:22:16] <Voyage_> did that.
[11:22:22] <Voyage_> thats why here for corrections
[11:23:02] <Voyage_> this is not working either $('.price input').each(function() {
[11:23:03] <Voyage_>             alert(parseFloat($(this).val());
[11:23:28] <robertmaxrees> mismatching open close parens.
[11:23:37] <zzaichik> Voyage_:  maybe try using this. https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isNumeric/
[11:23:37] <robertmaxrees> also: please stop pasting multiple lines into the channel :)
[11:23:55] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[11:23:55] <spottieOttie> paste away voyage your doin great kid
[11:24:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd still vote a simple generic function would be easier here.
[11:24:33] <Voyage_> ya but why the above not working spottieOttie  robertmaxrees  zzaichik
[11:24:48] <spottieOttie> oh shit i dont know let me take a look
[11:24:55] <robertmaxrees> among other things, you have a syntax error.
[11:24:59] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:25:02] <spottieOttie> cant you do some prelimanary debugger
[11:25:12] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ do you have your developer tools open?
[11:25:15] <spottieOttie> Robert said something about parenthesis
[11:25:56] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/ is a good guide on the basics of debugging and troubleshooting.
[11:26:20] <zzaichik> gotta match those parens /brackets n shit
[11:26:36] <spottieOttie> yo shouldnt the (this ) be (Each)
[11:26:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:27:13] <spottieOttie> well doesn't 'this' need some nominative affiliative something?
[11:27:24] <robertmaxrees> they're in an .each()
[11:27:28] <MrBeerBrewer> <3
[11:27:34] <Voyage_> robertmaxrees,  spottieOttie  fixed parentesis, opened firebug. no issues
[11:27:34] <MrBeerBrewer> robertmaxrees
[11:27:39] <robertmaxrees> 'this' is the current "thing" you're on
[11:27:44] <MrBeerBrewer> Hey how are you? :D
[11:27:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm alright.  yourself?
[11:27:59] <MrBeerBrewer> I am great thanks :D
[11:29:01] <IAmMe643> robertmaxrees: is this a valid jQuery selector: li#nextBtn>a?
[11:29:11] <robertmaxrees> sure, though a bad one.
[11:29:11] <IAmMe643> robertmaxrees: I know it is for css
[11:29:22] <robertmaxrees> #nextBtn > a is more than sufficient.
[11:29:30] <robertmaxrees> and jquery supports everything CSS supports, plus some.
[11:29:35] <IAmMe643> robertmaxrees: tried that too
[11:29:57] <IAmMe643> robertmaxrees: it appearently is still self-destructing.
[11:29:58] <Voyage_> robertmaxrees,  spottieOttie zzaichik  now why even line 22 is not working ?
[11:29:59] <Voyage_> https://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/8/
[11:30:14] <spottieOttie> im on the mothafucka, hold please
[11:30:17] <Voyage_> am. working now
[11:30:50] <IAmMe643> robertmaxrees: Maybe it is grabbing the page, loading it, and then trying to grab the next "next button" before it loads, thus self destructing.
[11:30:57] <spottieOttie> did you fix it voyage?
[11:31:07] <robertmaxrees> IAmMe643 uh...
[11:31:12] <robertmaxrees> "self descructing"?
[11:31:23] <robertmaxrees> without seeing a live example, i have no idea what you're talking abou tat this point.
[11:31:24] <robertmaxrees> i need to grab lunch.  be safe kids.
[11:31:30] <IAmMe643> robertmaxrees: yes. that is what the documentation says
[11:31:56] <robertLunch> before i go, IAmMe643 check out fixingthesejquery.com
[11:31:59] <robertLunch> kbyeee
[11:32:02] <zzaichik> Voyage_: that alert()?
[11:32:06] <IAmMe643> bye
[11:33:44] <IAmMe643> OK, here is the issue: jScroll (an infinite scroller) is loading the next page and ten stopping. The reason is because it is destroying the element for the next button.\
[11:34:02] <IAmMe643> jScroll says (for the next button): If this selector is not found, or if it does not contain a href attribute, jScroll will self-destroy and unbind from the element upon which it was called.
[11:34:22] <IAmMe643> I am thinking it is grabbing the page, loading it, and then trying to grab the next "next button" before it loads, thus self destructing.
[11:34:32] <IAmMe643> Thoughts?
[11:35:22] <Voyage_> zzaichik,  22 is not working. other things are. https://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/8/
[11:35:46] <skyofideas2015> hi I've a form that sends a request to the server on submit but I'm validating the data before the request gets sent when there is an invalid input I prevent the default action (preventDefault) for some reason it's working on firefox but not in chrome the preventDefault just stops the page to send any further request even from other forms
[11:36:07] <skyofideas2015> when I return false it just posts the request and ignores the return false
[11:36:10] <skyofideas2015> any idea?
[11:36:22] <Voyage_> am. zzaichik  wait. wrong syntax I used
[11:36:44] <Voyage_> am. zzaichik  wait. wrong syntax I used on 21 but still 22 should work. no?
[11:37:15] <zzaichik> 22 is working for me
[11:38:25] <zzaichik> Voyage_: inside that event, it's watching for the value of those .price input's to change. So when you focus on the input, enter a number and then move to the next one, it will trigger that event.
[11:38:30] <Voyage_> yes. zzaichik  https://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/9/    why 26 is not making alphabets to "0"
[11:41:32] <zzaichik> @Voyage_ I don't understand
[11:41:45] <zzaichik> you want to turn a string into an integer?
[11:41:51] <Voyage_> yes
[11:41:52] <zzaichik> parseInt()
[11:42:16] <gambl0re> you can use floatInt() also
[11:42:31] <gambl0re> but its best practice to use parseInt()
[11:42:46] <Voyage_> this should also work. {$(this).val(0);}
[11:43:03] <Voyage_> no?
[11:43:06] <Voyage_> yes. zzaichik  https://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/9/    why 26 is not making alphabets to "0"

[11:43:36] <skyofideas2015> any idea?
[11:44:37] <Voyage_> robertLunch,  ?
[11:45:49] <Voyage_> I think theres something wrong in this Number.isNaN($(this).val())
[11:45:51] <zzaichik> @Voyage_ I need to get some food, bbl. In the meantime, good luck
[11:46:09] <Voyage_> thx
[11:52:26] <Voyage_> what is wrong with this syntax?   if( Number.isNaN($(this).val()) ){$(this).val(0);}
[11:53:33] <Voyage_> what is wrong with this syntax?   if( Number.isNaN($(this).val()) ){$(this).val(0);}  line 26 of https://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/10/
[11:53:55] <decx> move your condition
[11:54:09] <Voyage_> am?
[11:54:12] <Voyage_> where
[11:54:44] <decx> val() can be a function
[11:55:13] <Voyage_> the alert on previous line works fine
[11:55:21] <Voyage_> decx,  so what should be done?
[11:55:57] <kegster> I have a menu that drops down on click -- how can i trigger the menu to hide when something else BESIDES the menu is clicked ?
[11:57:16] <decx> i dont get what you are even doing Voyage_
[11:58:45] <decx> oh that first thing is just to make it easier to start writing when val is 0
[11:58:55] <decx> so you just want to add all your inputs together?
[11:59:13] <decx> cache selectors, map the values and reduce that
[11:59:59] <Voyage_> decx,  right but I just want to know why the said line is not working?
[12:02:18] <IAmMe643> I figured out my problem. It's an inteded effect. It just works against itself on this.
[12:03:34] * Voyage_ waits
[12:04:46] <decx> i dont get what you are doing
[12:05:02] <decx> alert is very jarring
[12:05:06] <decx> use console
[12:06:43] <Voyage_> decx,  ok. doesnt works with concole either. its not about alert vs console. the problme is in syntax of line 26
[12:06:47] <Voyage_> what is the problme?
[12:11:48] <Es0teric> this fullpagejs thing is driving me insane
[12:11:49] <Es0teric> wtf
[12:13:03] <decx> the problem is that your Number.isNaN doesn't work because you're not dealing with a number
[12:13:31] <decx> stop using isNaN you have plenty of alternatives
[12:13:43] <decx> parseInt(value) || 0
[12:15:11] <Voyage_> decx,  I though we CAN pass stings to .isNaN(). cant we?
[12:15:21] <Voyage_> well this solved the issue if( Number.isNaN(parseFloat($(this).val())) ){$(this).val(0);}      instead of    this    if( Number.isNaN($(this).val()) ){$(this).val(0);}       but I though we CAN pass strings to .isNaN()...
[12:15:24] <choosegoose> to pass JSON via $.ajax, foo in {data: foo, ...} must be a string?
[12:15:36] <decx> that's just ugly
[12:16:16] <choosegoose> I am trying with an object i.e. $.ajax({data: {bar: baz}, ...}) and the server returns 400
[12:16:54] <choosegoose> (nvm found answer: likely, yes)
[12:18:42] <robertLunch> decx++
[12:24:02] <skyofideas2015> how can I access a function defined inside (function($){
[12:24:11] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[12:25:28] <robertmaxrees> variables declared inside of a function aren't available outside of that function.
[12:26:18] <vorscore> Voyage_ when you're doing Number.isNan, are you not converting to a number before checking if it's a number?
[12:26:39] <robertmaxrees> vorscore they had read the mdn documentation and assumed that it would suit their needs.
[12:27:18] <robertmaxrees> well, they read part of the documentation.
[12:27:22] <vorscore> Yea, i'm reading it now.
[12:29:22] <Voyage_> vorscore,    hm.. I just saw examples in this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN#Confusing_special-case_behavior   but you are correct
[12:29:56] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ what do you think the isNaN function is built to do?
[12:30:09] <Voyage_> hm
[12:30:13] <Voyage_> is not a numbr
[12:30:15] <vorscore> It looks like this is a well-had discussion across the web universe.
[12:30:26] <robertmaxrees> it's made to test oif something is NaN, which is a special value.
[12:30:56] <robertmaxrees> it's Numeric Not a Number.
[12:31:08] <robertmaxrees> it's a number that... isn't a number.  that's distinct from what you want to do here.
[12:36:14] <Voyage_> how to I grab the first child node of a parent node ?(the child has a specific class and it may not be the VERY first node of parent)?
[12:36:38] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery get first child node
[12:36:39] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: javascript - jQuery first child of "this" - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2275702/jquery-first-child-of-this
[12:37:07] <robertmaxrees> if you need the first one with a specific class, then .find('.theClass').first()
[12:38:04] <Voyage_> hm
[12:40:49] <Es0teric> does anyone
[12:41:04] <Es0teric> have a good parallax plugin that plays nice with twitter bootstrap?
[12:45:38] <Voyage_> decx, did you made #11?
[12:46:00] <decx> i'm already at 12 brah
[12:46:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:46:43] <decx> wrote an answer an was too lazy to post it
[12:51:44] <Voyage_> decx,  nice code
[12:52:03] <Voyage_> cant trace whats wrong at 22 to 28  http://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/14/
[12:52:25] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ open your console yo.
[12:52:39] <robertmaxrees> also: lol back to isNaN()
[12:52:43] <decx> look at the way i assign the checkbox in 12
[12:55:45] <Es0teric> seriously though?
[12:55:47] <Es0teric> nobody here
[12:55:50] <robertmaxrees> we're here, yo.
[12:55:51] <Es0teric> uses fullpagejs?
[12:55:52] <Es0teric> seriously?
[12:55:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:56:17] <gambl0re> i have a image gallery site with over 50+ images. when a user clicks on an image, a modal(bootstrap) of the image should display. how can i make this work efficiently without using a modal div for each image?
[12:56:35] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re have a single modal window whose contents you replace with the new image.
[12:57:13] <gambl0re> but the content is static..
[12:57:20] <robertmaxrees> congrats?
[12:57:43] <gambl0re> user clicks on image. that image will display...i need to create a div for each image in order for the modal to display the correct image
[12:57:46] <gambl0re> understand?
[12:57:50] <robertmaxrees> no you don't.
[12:57:59] <robertmaxrees> you can do a manual setup and control that instead.
[12:57:59] <Voyage_> robertmaxrees,  decx  I thin k I am having trouble in going deep and tracing nodes
[12:58:19] <gambl0re> what do you mean manual setup
[12:59:49] <Voyage_> whats wrong in tracing nodes like this  22 to 28  http://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/14/
[13:00:06] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ open your console.
[13:00:08] <robertmaxrees> you have an error.
[13:00:28] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re i mean create a single modal window and oppen/close that one.
[13:00:42] <Voyage_> dont see any error on console. robertmaxrees
[13:00:49] <Voyage_> I have firebug
[13:02:00] <gambl0re> i have one modal window for 50+ images?
[13:02:11] <gambl0re> but how does that modal window know which image to open?
[13:02:32] <gambl0re> i dont think you're understanidn what im trying to say..
[13:04:25] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re you use a click handler to replace the contents of the modal yourself.
[13:04:42] <IzaacJ> hey, is there a simple way to use jquery ajax to upload a file? this is not going to a simple filehandler, but a FuelPHP rest controller that handles everything.
[13:11:20] <amtrivedi> I am using jquery location picker, now I have provided a checkbox. If the value of the checkbox is true I want that the location field of the map gets locked and should not get updated if I move the marker.
[13:12:14] <amtrivedi> But when I try to pace if else in my jquery for map, the map does not gets displayed.
[13:12:23] <amtrivedi> http://dpaste.com/2ETJPQ0
[13:12:35] <amtrivedi> ^ This is the current jquery code.
[13:13:07] <robertmaxrees> *javascript, and show us the version that worked.
[13:13:16] <amtrivedi> http://dpaste.com/3YCX183
[13:13:17] <robertmaxrees> because i'm pretty sure i see the issue,
[13:13:23] <amtrivedi> Here is the HTML.
[13:14:02] <amtrivedi> robertmaxrees: Give me one sec.
[13:14:09] <robertmaxrees> nvm i see it.
[13:14:31] <robertmaxrees> you can't just $('#locinput').change(function() { there.
[13:15:05] <amtrivedi> Here is the working jquery
[13:15:06] <amtrivedi> http://dpaste.com/0JMSF8S
[13:15:12] <robertmaxrees> *javascript.
[13:15:17] <robertmaxrees> and yeah.
[13:15:20] <amtrivedi> Okay, then what should I do?
[13:15:50] <robertmaxrees> inside of onchanged, check to see what state #locinput is in.
[13:16:09] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do with cb.val(cb.prop('checked')) ?
[13:16:39] <amtrivedi> I was checking if the value of the checkbox is checked or not.
[13:16:52] <robertmaxrees> do cd.prop('checked')
[13:16:57] <robertmaxrees> no need for the extra .val() stuff.
[13:17:17] <amtrivedi> You mean to say this-
[13:17:18] <amtrivedi> if(cb.prop('checked'))
[13:17:19] <amtrivedi> ?
[13:17:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:17:44] <amtrivedi> Yes, done that.
[13:17:59] <robertmaxrees> and then just check all that logic inside the handler.
[13:18:05] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to set a different one.
[13:19:04] <amtrivedi> The code seems fine to me.
[13:19:10] <gambl0re> if i have a <img src=".." value="1"> and then i do ('img').val(); would that work?
[13:19:15] <amtrivedi>  $("#us3-address").prop('disabled',true);
[13:19:26] <amtrivedi> I have used this to disable the input field I want to disable
[13:19:34] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re you can't give inputs a val.
[13:19:37] <robertmaxrees> err, images.
[13:19:40] <robertmaxrees> only inputs can have valuies.
[13:19:54] <amtrivedi> And if the checkbox is unchecked, then I execute normal jquery for the map.
[13:19:55] <robertmaxrees> amtrivedi you can't do $('#locinput').change(function() { where you have it.
[13:20:23] <amtrivedi> robertmaxrees: Then what should I do?
[13:20:35] <robertmaxrees> put all your logic within the callback for onchanged.
[13:21:09] <amtrivedi> Oh, you mean to say that I should put it inside onchanged and check for the checkbox their itself?
[13:21:10] <gambl0re> what can i use to allow jquery to uniquely identify an image?
[13:21:29] <robertmaxrees> amtrivedi i mean to say that your syntax is bad.
[13:21:34] <ParserError> hi
[13:21:38] <robertmaxrees> but sure, you could put your logic inside that function :)
[13:21:46] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re $(this) inside your event handler.
[13:22:13] <amtrivedi> robertmaxrees: Okay, thanks.
[13:22:17] <ParserError> can you correct me my code ? https://jsfiddle.net/a94zpfvn/
[13:22:20] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:22:28] <robertmaxrees> ParserError we'll help you fix it though :)

[13:26:00] <gambl0re> can you use .find() on id's?
[13:26:03] <Voyage_> still cant figure out
[13:26:03] <Voyage_> whats wrong in tracing nodes like this  22 to 28  http://jsfiddle.net/xhn2d1vg/14/
[13:26:12] <jak2000> why if a input text have this value 'Hello World' when i assign to a value: var wauxvar = $( "#xcombcatvar option:selected" ).text(); only take: 'Hello'  note: xcombcatvar is a Select/Option thanks
[13:26:26] <acidjazz> gambl0re: sure but id's are supposed to be unique
[13:26:37] <acidjazz> gambl0re: so you should just be $('#id')'ing them
[13:26:48] <ParserError> and if i click on box where there are block yellow is already hidden then he reappears
[13:27:06] <acidjazz> jak2000: options are different
[13:27:23] <ParserError> gambl0re: yes i use but i don't know if it is valid
[13:27:46] <acidjazz> ParserError: i would look at css transitions instead of .animate()
[13:27:57] <acidjazz> ParserError: use JS to swap classes with removeClass and addClass and use CSS transitions
[13:28:42] <ParserError> ok ok acid i have this code with hasclass and remove class with slideDown and slideUp
[13:29:01] <acidjazz> ParserError: instead make a class that has transform translate(-100px, 0)
[13:29:06] <ParserError> where i put the css code ? in : https://jsfiddle.net/fumzilla/wfoqamc8/8/
[13:29:10] <acidjazz> ParserError: and a classs that has transform translate(0, 0)
[13:29:30] <acidjazz> ParserError: then swap those, and use in the origin class: transition: transform 1s linear;
[13:29:33] <ParserError> you can comment this code https://jsfiddle.net/fumzilla/wfoqamc8/8/ ?
[13:29:37] <acidjazz> k
[13:29:57] <amtrivedi> robertmaxrees: Okay, now I have got the map back. But it is not disabling the input field.
[13:30:29] <amtrivedi> robertmaxrees: As in it diables the input field, but the field is still dynamic, its value gets changed if I shift the marker.
[13:30:38] <amtrivedi> robertmaxrees: I hope you got my point.
[13:31:45] <robertmaxrees> amtrivedi you need to add logic outside of the plugin then.
[13:32:00] <acidjazz> ParserError: https://jsfiddle.net/wfoqamc8/9/
[13:32:15] <acidjazz> ParserError: you want to add slide to move, remove slide to slide back
[13:32:15] <robertmaxrees> :( make him try to learn.
[13:32:36] <acidjazz> ParserError: also in your click handler you say $('.ads'), that means all ads elements, not just the 1st or the one you click
[13:36:01] <jak2000> acidjazz var wauxsoccli = $( "#xcombcatpallsoccli option:selected" ).text();    i get the text of the select/option but if any option have by sample a item: 'Hello World'  only take Hello why?
[13:36:13] <gambl0re> robertmatrix...i still cant figure it out
[13:36:20] <gambl0re> how do i get this thing to work..
[13:37:16] <ParserError> acidjazz:  I wish that instead of my yellow blocks disappear up I will wish he retired the side
[13:39:40] <ParserError> I wish that instead of my yellow blocks disappear up I will wish he retired the side robertmaxrees but i don't know where i put code css because slideDown and slideUp use the disappearance from the top
[13:42:21] <acidjazz> ok well is it doing up now?
[13:42:24] <acidjazz> going*
[13:43:39] <ParserError> no acidjazz your code not comment and not changement
[13:44:11] <ParserError> not changed
[13:44:48] <jak2000> acidjazz any advice for me?
[13:45:26] <ParserError> can you comment where i put code animate({left : "-150%","swing"}) in this code : https://jsfiddle.net/fumzilla/wfoqamc8/8/
[13:45:40] <robertmaxrees> ParserError lol
[13:45:46] <robertmaxrees> if you want a developer, hire one.
[13:46:01] <gambl0re> yea ill hire you if you fix my problem.
[13:46:25] <ParserError> lol robertmaxrees thank you but i search just a information
[13:46:36] <robertmaxrees> ParserError you're asking people to do the work for you ;)
[13:46:39] <acidjazz> ParserError: i jsut gave you the css advice
[13:46:55] <robertmaxrees> asking me to put in a comment is effectively the same as me just doing it.
[13:46:55] <acidjazz> jak2000: so you are trying to cahnge the text of an input option?
[13:47:01] <acidjazz> jak2000: can I see a jsfiddle
[13:47:28] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re welcome to programming.  head over to the bootstrap channel if you want more details or a freelancer channel if you want to hire someone.

[14:15:46] <robertmaxrees> upload?
[14:15:49] <robertmaxrees> to a json file?
[14:16:53] <IzaacJ> should've mentioned this is in a fuelphp application, and that's how the rest controller works
[14:17:29] <IzaacJ> it defines what format the response should be

[14:20:19] <robertmaxrees> see if this helps/.
[14:26:40] <IzaacJ> thanks :D that worked :D
[14:32:27] <gambl0re> how come when i do $(this).children('img').attr('src'); it returns undefined but if i do $(this).children('label').attr('src'); it returns the labels value
[14:32:59] <gambl0re> the img has a src value
[14:33:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your html.
[14:34:25] <gambl0re> ok..there you go
[14:34:26] <gambl0re> http://jsfiddle.net/shukjvcc/
[14:34:36] <robertmaxrees> really?
[14:34:42] <robertmaxrees> not helpful.
[14:34:59] <gambl0re> you wanted the html
[14:35:01] <robertmaxrees> just the bit you're working on, duder.
[14:36:16] <gambl0re> http://jsfiddle.net/shukjvcc/1/ ...there you go my friend
[14:37:02] <robertmaxrees> so what is $(this) referring to?
[14:37:35] <gambl0re> the div
[14:38:07] * robertmaxrees sees 2 divs
[14:38:20] * robertmaxrees wonders why this isn't just a self-contained example.
[14:38:33] <gambl0re> $('div.portfolio-item')
[14:38:52] <robertmaxrees> there is no direct child of that element that is a label.
[14:39:26] <gambl0re>                 <a href="#aus-1" data-toggle="modal" label="aus-1" role="dialog"
[14:39:32] <robertmaxrees> that is not a label element.
[14:39:36] <robertmaxrees> that is an anchor that has a label.
[14:39:36] <gambl0re> attribute
[14:40:02] <robertmaxrees> iirc label is not a valid attribute.
[14:40:10] <robertmaxrees> and .children('label') won't find that.
[14:40:18] <robertmaxrees> that's looking for a <label> element.
[14:41:00] <gambl0re> but when i do alert on the label attribute it still returns the value
[14:41:08] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're doing.
[14:41:12] <robertmaxrees> because something isn't adding up here.
[14:41:18] <robertmaxrees> make a simplified test case :)
[14:41:26] <gambl0re> ok wait!
[14:49:47] <gambl0re> http://jsfiddle.net/shukjvcc/6/
[14:51:07] <robertmaxrees> hey so i'm at work and my coworkers might not appreciate that image ;)
[14:51:45] <robertmaxrees> updated.
[14:52:35] <gambl0re> oh sorry
[14:53:00] <gambl0re> i can get the attribute value of label but not src
[14:54:13] <robertmaxrees> first off.
[14:54:19] <robertmaxrees> .children() only goes one level.
[14:54:36] <robertmaxrees> since img is 2 levels deep, the handler doesn't find it.
[14:55:01] <gambl0re> childrent is only one level deep?
[14:55:06] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:55:51] <robertmaxrees> second off - label isn't technically a vvalid attribute.
[14:55:53] <gambl0re> you didnt tell me
[14:56:04] <robertmaxrees> didn't tell you what?
[14:56:19] <gambl0re> nothing. what can i use to search the entire children?
[14:56:24] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[14:57:29] <gambl0re> i thought .find() seasrches for siblings
[14:57:52] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/find/
[14:58:03] <arc_> find searches for everything in the jquery object you pass it
[14:58:10] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:58:13] <robertmaxrees> no it doesn't.
[14:58:24] <arc_> everything that matches the argument -_-
[14:58:46] <VanDerGroot> Hey guys. Having a weird jquery problem.
[14:58:46] <robertmaxrees> "Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element."
[14:58:58] <VanDerGroot> document ready isn't firing. Sometimes.
[14:59:04] <robertmaxrees> VanDerGroot sure it is.
[14:59:08] <robertmaxrees> unless your page is invalid.
[14:59:36] <VanDerGroot> robertmaxrees, would my page be invalid, sometimes?
[14:59:42] <robertmaxrees> depends on how it's generated.
[14:59:54] <robertmaxrees> it could also be always invalid and you're running into race conditions.
[14:59:54] <gambl0re> thanks robertmatrix..!
[15:00:02] <robertmaxrees> lol you keep autocompleting wrong ;)
[15:00:15] <VanDerGroot> what are race conditions?
[15:00:20] <VanDerGroot> never mind, I'll google it. :)
[15:00:44] <robertmaxrees> let's ask this question - how are you detecting document ready?
[15:02:14] <VanDerGroot> in a script tag I have $( document ).ready(function()
[15:02:14] <VanDerGroot> 	{
[15:02:25] <robertmaxrees> okay.  have you validated your page?
[15:02:36] <VanDerGroot> no?
[15:02:42] <robertmaxrees> might give that a shot.
[15:02:54] <VanDerGroot> validate through what?
[15:03:15] <robertmaxrees> !g validate html
[15:03:15] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: The W3C Markup Validation Service → https://validator.w3.org/
[15:04:08] <VanDerGroot> thanks. I'll check that.
[15:05:29] <VanDerGroot> Yikes. My code is horrendous! :(
[15:05:44] <VanDerGroot> Thanks for pointing me to that resource. :)
[15:06:54] <robertmaxrees> also: console errors?
[15:06:58] <robertmaxrees> different things to check.
[15:08:53] <gambl0re> robertmatrix are you a web developer?
[15:09:03] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re wrong username.
[15:09:18] <robertmaxrees> you keep making that mistake :)
[15:09:25] <gambl0re> what?.
[15:09:51] <robertmaxrees> my username isn't robertmatrix
[15:10:04] <gambl0re> are you a senior developer?
[15:10:16] <robertmaxrees> somebody knows how to google :)
[15:10:53] <gambl0re> just asking..
[15:11:03] <robertmaxrees> yes.  I'm a sr. frontend developer.
[15:12:03] <gambl0re> cool.
[15:12:14] <gambl0re> i hope you're making a lot of money.
[15:12:21] <robertmaxrees> i do, too.
[15:12:36] <gambl0re> nice..
[15:33:08] <acidjazz> if my jquery selector is super long
[15:33:17] <acidjazz> like $('ths, that, this, that, this, that')
[15:33:23] <acidjazz> how else can i supply multiple selectors?
[15:33:31] <acidjazz> can i $(['this', 'that', 'this', 'that']);
[15:33:37] <acidjazz> taht way I can organize them more?
[15:33:45] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like a markup problem.
[15:34:23] <acidjazz> nah i just have like 3-4 carousels
[15:34:25] <acidjazz> on one damn thing
[15:34:27] <acidjazz> and they all use the same function
[15:34:37] <acidjazz> arrows and dots and all that crap
[15:34:54] <acidjazz> maybe ill populate them with an array and rock a join with a ,
[15:36:53] <acidjazz> you're probably right css-wise
[15:49:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd just give them all a shared class.
[16:02:39] <acidjazz> yea FINE

[18:15:53] <IzaacJ> hey guys. It seems that Auth::member($groupid, $user) is broken? I've passed a whole lot of array('Simpleauth', $uid) as $user but it is either fracking out or checking if currently signed in user is a member of that group. I need it to check if any $user is a member, to show their privilegies on a member list
[18:17:06] <snover> that’s not a jquery question
[18:17:15] <snover> i can tell from the pixels.
[18:17:26] <IzaacJ> oh, damn, thought I was still in the fuelphp channel xD lol

[19:51:32] <Es0teric> so tw2113 do you know how to get the main content in this https://jsfiddle.net/ws8y37tr/5/embedded/result/ to be in the center without the text overlapping?
[19:52:22] <Es0teric> or without any clipping in the div
[19:53:04] <tw2113> my only guess is auto for left and right margins and the div being not 100%
[19:55:56] * drej hugs tw2113 
[19:56:11] <drej> tw2113:  why arent you hanging out with the cool kids in ##frontend yet?
[19:56:32] <tw2113> because I'm too cool
[19:57:04] <tw2113> and I don't do that much frontend these days anyway
[20:02:20] <Es0teric> tw2113 the problem is that i am using a slider
[20:02:24] <Es0teric> a parallax slider
[20:03:50] <Es0teric> tw2113 so how would i go about making what i want to happen happen?
[20:04:34] <tw2113> dunno, i hate dealing with parallax and sliders in general
[20:05:02] <drej> lol
[20:05:14] <Es0teric> i mean i am saying how would i calculate the pixel height between the navigation and the top of the footer?
[20:05:26] <Es0teric> the parallax slider i am using has a callback after slide render
[20:05:29] <tw2113> dunno
[20:05:48] <tw2113> JS has never been my strongest point either
[20:08:15] <Es0teric> lolwut? $('#navbar).offset().bottom - $('#footer_container').offset().top SyntaxError: illegal character
[20:09:48] <Es0teric> tw2113 do you know why i get that syntax error?
[20:10:15] <tw2113> nope
[20:10:25] <tw2113> other than the missing single quote
[20:19:21] <Voyage> how to make the TH of a table always stick to the top    <-- without JS
[20:23:32] <sjuxax> Hello. I have code that looks kinda like this: http://jsfiddle.net/se42xnan/ . I am using an async_submission function to request something from an API. I want to cancel the original submission until I get a response and then edit the original form's contents and resubmit in the callback. This doesn't seem to be working -- the original form submits right away. Any ideas?
[20:25:49] <Es0teric> how do i compress the items in a container according to screen resolution?
[20:26:43] <tw2113> use percentage or em based widths?
[20:27:28] <Es0teric> tw2113 well i am already using twitter bootstrap

[21:08:19] <Etriaph> Does anyone have a solution for inconsistent behavior in .animate { scrollTop: target.offset().top }... behavior between Chrome and Firefox?
[21:08:54] <Etriaph> Chrome correctly scrolls to the correct anchor and Firefox scrolls one mousewheel flick further down.
[21:16:27] <Uhkis> Etriaph: got a demo of this?
[21:30:02] <Etriaph> Uhkis: Yup, one sec..
[21:32:13] <Etriaph> Uhkis: OK to PM a link?
[21:36:10] <Uhkis> yup
[21:37:29] <Etriaph> Ah, it's all good, spent 3.5 hours chasing this down and the anchor needed to be parallel to it's parent.
[21:37:40] <Etriaph> Thanks anyway Uhkis :D
[21:38:00] <Uhkis> :)
[21:38:57] <jak2000> how to hide a column (of a html table)?
[21:40:41] <Uhkis> $(element).hide() as usual
[21:40:43] <Etriaph> jak2000: Give the TH/TD a specific ID and hide.
[21:41:19] <Etriaph> jak2000: Or a class if you want to do both at the same time.
[21:41:36] <Etriaph> $('.hideThese').hide()
[21:44:20] <jak2000> Etriaph ok understand only a dude, not need specify the tablename?
[21:45:58] <Uhkis> just select the object as usual
[21:46:02] <Etriaph> jak2000: If you do a: <th class="hideThese"> and <td class="hideThese"> for both heading and cells and then do $('.hideThese').hide() it'll hide the column.
[21:48:21] <jak2000> hide both columns right?
[21:52:19] <Etriaph> That'll hide one column, for both it's heading and it's data, if your table is structured as would be expected.
[21:52:59] <Etriaph> table.thead.tr.th and table.tbody.tr.td respectively
[21:53:04] <Etriaph> brb.
[21:58:36] <jak2000> Etriaph :( worked (hide the th, but the td continue here...
[22:02:02] <Uhkis> jak2000: when you probably used different class in the td
[22:02:32] <jak2000> i do the job with id
[22:03:43] <jak2000> noww put a class in each th and td respectively
[22:04:34] <jak2000> need declare in the css section the selector?
[22:04:48] <jak2000> .class1 { display: none }?
[22:07:58] <jak2000> Uhkis?
[22:16:53] <Uhkis> if you're doing that, you dont need jquery at all
[22:24:49] <momoterra> anyone know any good slideshow that does responsive height
[22:25:54] <parveen> how to get value from one datetimepicker and assign that date of some other datetimepicker after adding one day  ?
[22:27:42] <Uhkis> on change of the first, get the value, set the value of the other
[22:29:44] <parveen> Uhkis , not able to increment day by one
[22:30:00] <parveen> coz that may effect the month or year as well
[22:34:48] <Uhkis> something like: var new = Date.parse(firstval); new.setDate(parseInt(new.getDate())+1)
[22:36:55] <Uhkis> you may wanna use moment.js since Date is pretty bad
[22:38:45] <parveen> Uhkis  do you have any example ?
[22:44:54] <Uhkis> http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/
[22:51:21] <momoterra> does anyone ever run into a similar plugin like this http://www.aaronvanderzwan.com/maximage/
