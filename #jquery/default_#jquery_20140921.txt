[00:25:11] <shebbi> Hi, I am experiencing a very strange jQuery response. Each time I send an AJAX request it compounds the number of responses I get. On first AJAX request I get one response as expected. The second request will give two responses, and so on. I know this as I get multiple alert messages comming back. Anyone experinced this phenonmenon before?
[00:48:14] <puchacz> is it just me or blueimp file uploader is really convoluted?
[00:49:04] <puchacz> I don't want to use DELETE requests; I see no clear distinction between the plugin itself and the example application....
[00:49:46] <puchacz> is there clearer docs or tutorial somewhere?
[00:50:19] <puchacz> I already use bootstrap so this part suits me fine, but I only want to upload multiple files with ajax progressbar
[00:59:11] <litropy> shebbi, I haven't. Sure you're not firing the function multiple times somewhere in your code?
[01:00:13] <shebbi> litropy: First time I click on an ajax trigger I just get the one normal response. it then compunds after that.
[01:00:43] <shebbi> litropy: So it works right the first time.
[01:00:51] <litropy> shebbi, Hm. jsfiddle your ajax function and I'll see what's up.
[01:01:28] <shebbi> litropy: is there a way to check the events to see what triggers them?
[01:03:26] <litropy> shebbi, I usually find anywhere I call the function in my code and put something like console.log('Calling ajax from this function that does this thing'); just beofre each time I call it.
[01:03:56] <litropy> shebbi, there might be a better way.
[01:04:06] <litropy> but I don't know of one.
[01:04:41] <shebbi> HOw to view console log in IE?
[01:05:04] <naomi> shebbi google couldn't tell you that, huh ?
[02:15:03] <shebbi> Hi, I am experiencing a very strange jQuery response. Each time I send an AJAX request it compounds the number of responses I get. On first AJAX request I get one response as expected. The second request will give two responses, and so on. I know this as I get multiple alert messages comming back. Anyone experinced this phenonmenon before? here is the link: http://jsfiddle.net/aq93m2bs/
[02:21:28] <Woet> shebbi: why do you have an onclick inside an onclick?
[02:22:07] <shebbi> Woet: the first onclick is suppose to show the li.bar for selection
[02:22:10] <Woet> each time you click on img.foo it creates another onclick handler for li.bar
[02:22:42] <shebbi> Woet: sounds like that is the problem. how to fix it?
[02:22:50] <Woet> but not having onclick handlers inside onclick handlers
[02:23:04] <Woet> e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/aq93m2bs/1/
[02:23:47] <shebbi> what have you changed?
[02:23:57] <shebbi> just the //hi?
[02:23:59] <Woet> no
[02:24:03] <Woet> i closed the first onclick handler
[02:24:10] <Woet> before opening the new one
[02:24:52] <shebbi> oh... ok thanks i will try that
[02:45:23] <taleeb_> i want to show controller flash message through jquery and want to fade it?
[02:45:36] <taleeb_> i tried this one
[02:45:54] <taleeb_> https://gist.github.com/taleeb35/2823ebab0cc6a32e4e71
[04:44:00] <Dev0n> hey, I want to have my main function x() call a number of other registered functions (which pass the value from the callback before), then finally x() call another function after the final call back. I came across  jQuery.Callbacks(), would this what I would need to look into? Not sure if it would be possible to have a .then() after running callback.fire(...) to have my final function be called?
[04:56:50] <litropy> I'm on ubuntu. What's a good editor that recognizes/supports jquery? I'd prefer not to install eclipse, but I'm okay with that if it's the best option.
[04:59:17] <Cork> litropy: vim, gvim (free) or sublime text (really good, but costs)
[04:59:48] <litropy> Cork, looks like I'm going to load some plugins into gedit.
[05:00:21] <Cork> geany is another quite good editor
[05:00:29] <Cork> litropy: i'm no fan of gedit
[05:00:42] <Cork> but if it works for you, go for it
[05:01:21] <pbor> Cork: any specific reason (honest question)?
[05:01:35] * pbor <- gedit developer
[05:01:48] <Cork> pbor: historically hard to adjust, and complicated to extend
[05:02:00] <litropy> Cork, I'm open to ideas. I'm not ready to get into vim, although I know it's not that much of a curve. I'll look into geany.
[05:02:12] <Cork> in modern versions, it has gone down the drain and is barely usable as a note keeper anymore
[05:02:25] <Cork> pbor: up until gnome 3.12 i used gedit a lot
[05:02:32] <Cork> in 3.12 i uninstalled it completely
[05:02:52] <Cork> and in old gnome 2 days it was my main developer editor
[05:03:20] <Cork> litropy: i can warmly recommend to have a look at sublime text
[05:03:37] <Cork> they have a nag version that is fee
[05:03:40] <Cork> *free
[05:03:50] <Cork> but it keeps nagging about buying it :)
[05:03:56] <pbor> Cork: if you have time to discuss specifics, I'd be happy to listen
[05:04:49] <Cork> pbor: about a year ago i would prob have been, i was more or less in a editor crisis back then cause of how things went
[05:05:08] <Cork> but then i bit the bullet and bought sublime, and ya, it is superior
[05:05:21] <pbor> okay
[05:05:23] <Cork> in basically every way except the opensource area
[05:05:37] <pbor> I guess we'll try to win you back at some point :)
[05:05:45] <Cork> go for it
[05:06:30] <litropy> Cork, thx - I'm poor and I hate nags. It seems jquery is still on the wishlist for geany http://www.geany.org/Support/PluginWishlist
[05:06:58] <Cork> pbor: basically the removal of toolbars and moving it into these clokny titlebar buttons is one of the reasons, but ya that's a gnome thing
[05:07:53] <pbor> Cork: but sublime does not have a toolbar, does it? :)
[05:08:13] <Cork> pbor: well it does have a menubar
[05:08:31] <Cork> ya, the toolbar i didn't care too much about
[05:08:36] <Cork> (meant menubar not tooblar)
[05:10:00] <Cork> what i need in an editor is a really good treeview, syntax highlighting and good themeing (dark themes is a must for me)
[05:10:29] <pbor> the gear button thingie clearly has pros and cons, in 3.14 it changed again a little
[05:10:31] <Cork> support for multi edit, and a good regex search and replace is next on the list
[05:10:48] <pbor> I think we have all of those
[05:11:00] <Cork> search and replace is really messed up in gedit
[05:11:13] <Cork> i've never been able to get a predictable result from it
[05:11:22] <Cork> and the plugins for it is even worse
[05:11:37] <pbor> mmm
[05:11:55] <pbor> weird, I am not aware of major bugs with s&r
[05:12:01] <litropy> Really? I use it all the time. Are we talking simple search: string | replace: newstring?
[05:12:13] <Cork> also i thin there is a plugin for searching in a tree (search and replace)
[05:12:19] <Cork> but i never got it to work
[05:12:30] <pbor> yeah, that's a weak spot
[05:12:40] <Cork> litropy: simple search works, and simple text replace sure
[05:12:42] <Cork> regex, no
[05:12:58] <litropy> ah, I see
[05:13:13] <pbor> at some point we'll get to it ourselves, the third party plugin have varying quality
[05:13:20] <Cork> there is some form of native regex support, but that scares me more then anything
[05:13:52] <pbor> for regex search&replace I'd very much like to have bugreports
[05:14:04] <pbor> because it should work fine
[05:14:11] <Cork> ex searching for ^[0-9] to replace that in regexes in the page doesn't give the result you expect
[05:14:19] * pbor tries
[05:14:36] <Cork> i haven't really been able to figure it out
[05:14:46] <Cork> it looks like some regex characters are supported
[05:14:50] <Cork> but no way to turn it off
[05:14:51] <pbor> it should just use PCRE syntax
[05:15:49] <pbor> and there is a checkbox to enable/disable regex matching
[05:15:55] <Cork> oh right, i remember another thing
[05:16:11] <Cork> the hole "unknown file format" drove me nuts
[05:16:17] <Cork> and was actually what made me switch
[05:16:43] <Cork> someone wrote a none ascii character in a file and you couldn't open it in gedit
[05:16:57] <Cork> the entire file was hidden if you tried to open it
[05:18:10] <pbor> yeah, we support many encodings, but to load the file in the textview we need to be able to properly convert to utf8 :(
[05:27:59] <Dev0n> so here is my attempt at $.Callbacks and I expected the output to be ['foo', 'bar'], but callbacks seems ot be printing out an object instead?    http://jsbin.com/zufoyoqazudo/2/edit?js,console
[05:29:18] <diverdude> Can you guys recommen some great blogs and articles for learning jquery and best jquery practices?
[05:32:39] <litropy> diverdude, I gotta say: The straight up docs are very good. Pay attention to the left-hand side, as everything is organized there: http://api.jquery.com/
[05:33:52] <diverdude> litropy, is $(function(){...}) the same as $(document).ready(function(){...}) ?
[05:35:21] <litropy> diverdude, $( document ).ready(function() {...})
[05:35:47] <litropy> diverdude, nevermind, I just re-read.
[05:35:47] <diverdude> yes?
[05:35:55] <diverdude> ahok
[05:39:28] <diverdude> why is it better to use document.ready than body oninit
[05:40:15] <litropy> $(function(){...}) can fire even before document.ready.
[05:41:11] <litropy> diverdude, not exactly sure. Gotta get back to work. Perhaps someone else will chime in.
[05:52:12] <ggt> Is it possible to use two different versions of jquery library on the same page?
[05:52:37] <_rgn> diverdude: yes, it's the same thing
[06:09:07] <ggt> Does noConflict() "work on" jquery-ui also?
[06:09:34] <ggt> seems like it?
[06:35:38] <t4nk678> hi. i am trying to get the next sibling's id using next() and siblings(). i get the element just fine but when i use .attr('id') it returns 'undefined'. any thoughts?
[06:38:09] <t4nk678> the two elements inside the div are: <input id="input_id" > </input> <button type="submit" id="button_id" disabled=true >send</button>
[06:38:58] <klurbin> I'm trying to setup tooltips that appear whenever the mouse is on a MAC address cell. I've got it mostly working using jquery-ui tooltips, but the tooltips don't show up until the second time I mouseover a cell. http://jsfiddle.net/8mtuqosL/9/
[07:18:46] <ice_xcalibur> userlist
[07:42:26] <scar> is there a way to make a solid color all black vector graphic (illustration of an outine of a computer, for example) fade into white? i can export as SVG if i need, but i can create the hover state just fine as well on hover (changing black to white then save again) but i cannot get it to fade/transition into that color.
[07:46:49] <decx> transition: fill
[07:49:23] <scar> hmmm i was lookin for filters the whole time heh
[07:50:03] <decx> na just css will do
[07:50:26] <scar> so something like
[07:50:36] <scar> on hover, fill:#fff; transition:fill .3s eas; ?
[07:50:39] <scar> ease*
[07:51:15] <decx> right http://jsfiddle.net/mb7tw9wy/
[07:51:34] <scar> does it have to be SVG?
[07:51:53] <decx> what other websafe vector formats do you know?
[07:51:53] <Dev0n> he, can I use jQuery.Callbacks() to pass values between each listed function?
[07:52:19] <scar> i should have asked does it have to be vector
[07:52:23] <scar> but it appears it needs to be
[07:55:07] <scar> i imagine if it's a PNG, nothing can be done except the filter
[07:56:05] <decx> yeah you can use svg filter effects on html elements
[07:56:07] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/zzYqN/
[07:58:30] <scar> yeah but if i have this image, is there a way to transition the black to white on hover?  v
[07:59:12] <decx> what invert the colorscale?
[07:59:39] <decx> feColorMatrix will do
[08:00:52] <scar> and if it's something not as simple, like say i wanted to turn it red-- same feColorMatrix you think?
[08:01:06] <decx> it's all in the matrix
[08:01:53] <scar> hmm feColorMatrix seems to be used on SVGs though. i know you say you can apply it, but it'll work outside of an <svg> ?
[08:02:40] <decx> like in my last fiddle
[08:02:51] <decx> css filter: can be fed with an svg
[08:04:34] <scar> well this svg stuff is way over me, but i did look again at your fiddle and i think i see what you mean with the url filte
[08:04:35] <scar> filter
[08:06:42] <decx> here's a simplified one http://jsfiddle.net/w25g6nqn/
[08:07:18] <decx> the svg doesnt have to be in the html, you can reference it in the css like any file filter: url(myfilter.svg#aneffect)
[08:12:54] <scar> hmm
[08:13:12] <scar> still seems filter-y to me. i dont see a solid color change really across the board
[08:13:29] <scar> probably can't using that iamge though
[08:13:30] <scar> image*
[08:13:37] <scar> otherwise it'd be solid red i guess
[08:23:32] <decx> aaaw man, i turned off the manchester game after 3:1 -.-
[08:23:47] <drej> and then what happened
[08:23:52] <decx> 3:5
[08:24:33] <decx> against a promoted team even
[08:25:09] <Prometheian> I'm using qTip2 to set tooltips for two links. I have the tooltips showing up with solid data, however both links are setup to the same tooltip. This 'should' be fine but if I mouse over a, then b, then a again, a breaks. Additionally I'm updating a knockout object on hover so I have no idea if that's conflicting. https://github.com/krishnaglick/PokemonMastersGuildSite/blob/master/PokemonMastersGu

[08:25:58] <Prometheian> https://github.com/krishnaglick/PokemonMastersGuildSite/blob/master/PokemonMastersGuildSite/Views/GuildRoster/Index.cshtml
[08:26:01] <Prometheian> Ah, bad link.
[08:44:10] <mukesh> Redirect website with  www
[08:44:16] <mukesh> ??
[08:45:56] <Prometheian> The link got cutoff in my irc client so I sent it again
[08:47:28] <Jattenalle> i like mukesh, no bullshit, straight to the question!
[08:47:41] <Jattenalle> granted, the question was nonsense, and impossible to answer
[08:47:45] <Jattenalle> but at least he didnt ask to ask
[09:01:37] <decx> always finding the bright side
[09:02:19] <MtTaz> hello i need some help would someone assist me with this http://stackoverflow.com/q/25960508/3633804
[09:02:48] <MtTaz> i simply want my image to be clickable
[09:03:39] <MtTaz> images
[09:04:23] <Prometheian> <a href=""><img /></a>
[09:04:23] <Jattenalle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GThxpjwMudA "100 billion operations per second!"
[09:05:35] <decx> look at this blurred out texture, bilinear filtering literally makes all the work out texture artists do pointless!
[09:05:41] <decx> our*
[09:05:57] <MtTaz> i did that im doing a rotator
[09:06:05] <MtTaz> with an image
[09:06:19] <Jattenalle> rotator?
[09:06:20] <Jattenalle> a carousel?
[09:06:26] <MtTaz> here is the jquery :<script>   $(function(){   $('.fadein img:gt(0)').hide();   setInterval(function(){$('.fadein :first-child').fadeOut().next('img').fadeIn().end().appendTo('.fadein');}, 4000); }); </script>
[09:06:36] <MtTaz> html :  <div class="fadein">        <img src="/site/images/hp-d-rotate-t.jpg" alt="ad rotator" />        <img src="/site/images/hp-d-rotate-e.jpg" alt="ad rotator" />        </div>
[09:07:18] <MtTaz> I tried <a href ="ab1.html"><img src="/site/images/hp-d-rotate-t.jpg" alt="rotator" /></a> <a href ="ab2.html"><img src="/site/images/hp-d-rotate-e.jpg" alt="rotator" /></a> and changes the jquery to this .next('img')... to .next('a')... and $('.fadein img:gt(0)') to $('.fadein a:gt(0)')
[09:07:30] <MtTaz> but its not working
[09:07:38] <Jattenalle> MtTaz, jsfiddle.net to paste code... that's unreadable garbage
[09:07:47] <MtTaz> okay srry one sec
[09:08:07] <decx> the hell are you appending for?
[09:08:12] <MtTaz> i have the code right here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25960508/add-link-to-image-rotator
[09:08:31] <MtTaz> i'm not a jquery person someone helped me with the code -- i' just learning jquery
[09:09:11] <MtTaz> i hope that site will suffice otherwise i'll create a fiddle
[09:12:35] <MtTaz> any ideas?
[09:13:27] <decx> just use any image rotator plugin
[09:13:30] <adv_> need some help with blockUI. i want to block a div element until the php code generating the elements is finished. how can i do this?
[09:14:38] <MtTaz> i rather just adjust the code since its already working and set up on the site all i'll need to do is link each image
[09:16:02] <MtTaz> but thats what causing the hiccup
[09:16:25] <MtTaz> there must be something which i'm forgetting to do in the jquery
[09:17:28] <adv_> the php is generating some data upon loading the page and displays it in a div, i want to use blockUI to block() that div until the whole generation has finished
[09:17:44] <MtTaz> here is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/8ok4bzwv/
[09:19:25] <MtTaz> here is the updated one thats causing issues http://jsfiddle.net/8ok4bzwv/2/
[09:19:50] <decx> .fadein :first-child applies to every first child under fadein
[09:19:53] <decx> that is the a and the img
[09:20:04] <decx> a:first-child or whatever
[09:20:15] <MtTaz> that will fix it adding the a
[09:20:18] <MtTaz> ?
[09:20:36] <d0de> why does the second console.log always capture the last "name" in the object when I run this function? http://jsfiddle.net/ut8z0tv9/
[09:20:37] <decx> i wouldnt say fix... it'S still aweful ^^
[09:21:49] <d0de> like, it doesn't bind each player individually
[09:22:08] <d0de> it binds them all and always feeds seamlessLoopTick the last player objects in the parent object
[09:22:42] <d0de> if I put a console.log outside the .bind function, it logs each name of each player object
[09:22:53] <d0de> but if I put it within the .bind function, it logs the last player name for each player
[09:24:06] <MtTaz> hmm so decx that fixes the rotating images...they are now rotating fine but clicking on the image doesn't work
[09:26:40] <shoky_> d0de: because by the time the .bind callback is called, the for loop is already long finished, and "name" will have the last value, because vars in JS are scoped to their surrounding function, not to their block (so its as if "name" is declared outside the for loop in your fiddle)
[09:28:31] <d0de> shoky_, ahh, I see. How would you get around it? Normally I guess I could just pass $(this) to the helper function, but I need to keep a reference to "name" so I can look up the second player that's involved
[09:28:37] <d0de> should passing $(this) work?
[09:28:51] <shoky_> d0de: use .forEach or $.each instead of a for loop  http://jsfiddle.net/ut8z0tv9/1/
[09:29:16] <d0de> shoky_, excellent, thanks!
[09:32:53] <jaccob> Anyone can help me get the text element here: http://jsfiddle.net/3cLoa7wx/
[09:33:28] <MtTaz> okay its working thank you decx you are a wonderful person much help!
[09:35:33] <shoky_> jaccob: $(this).text()   donno why you've got empty <span>s there
[09:35:48] <jaccob> $( "*" ) selects everything?
[09:36:13] <shoky_> every element, yes. you probably don't want to do that
[09:36:35] <jaccob> shoky_, thx, its a stripped down of my actually markup
[09:36:47] <shoky_> jaccob: http://jsfiddle.net/3cLoa7wx/1/
[09:37:06] <shoky_> if there's more text inside the <label> though it'll also be there
[09:37:35] <shoky_> would be best to put that text inside an element of its own with some class. then use  $(this).find('.theclass').text()
[09:37:39] <jaccob> shoky_, yep, that worked perfect thx, I actually tried text, dunno why it didn't work, let me try again
[09:38:03] <shoky_> well, not best, but better ;p
[09:39:25] <jaccob> yeah text() wont work, cause I have text inside the span which get included in the result of text() along with white space
[09:39:37] <shoky_> hence, what i said next
[09:40:47] <shoky_> jaccob: http://jsfiddle.net/3cLoa7wx/2/
[09:40:50] <jaccob> Yeah I guess I could just wrap it in a span with a class name
[09:41:21] <shoky_> that's what spans are for :P
[09:41:55] <jaccob> shoky_, thx
[09:42:07] <shoky_> yw
[09:42:50] <ytrezq> Hello, any ideas for this http://stackoverflow.com/q/25838472/2284570 ?
[09:44:02] <shoky_> ytrezq it's not really possible without having the whole file, i believe. you don't know where the relevant metadata block is
[09:44:27] <jaccob> jquery find() only look at the children eh?
[09:44:37] <shoky_> jaccob descendants, yes
[09:44:53] <adv_> anyone?
[09:45:13] <ytrezq> shoky_: You just saw it it possible with the HTML5 answer (but a large portion doesn't support H.264)
[09:45:32] <jaccob> adv_, hide() show()
[09:45:51] <adv_> jaccob: hm? that's not blockUI right?
[09:47:04] <adv_> actually i think i don't only want blockUI but also some additional async stuff. since php is working for 10 secs but i want to immediately display the page , block the elements div and unblock when it's finished
[09:51:49] <adv_> or can i just do it with blockUI?
[09:55:09] <ytrezq> shoky_: So it is possible
[09:55:10] <shoky_> ytrezq: and not every mp4 would support that, even if the browser supports the codec
[09:55:22] <shoky_> ytrezq: depends on the file.
[09:55:49] <shoky_> ytrezq: http://jsfiddle.net/99gx0t47/  has to download the whole file first
[09:57:04] <ytrezq> shoky_: All the mp4 are for a target domain name. They perfectly support it (tested with ffmpeg/vlc/and internet explorer with http://stackoverflow.com/a/25955498/2284570)
[10:03:28] <ytrezq> shoky_: you can try it out in IE, your http://jsfiddle.net/99gx0t47/1/ : worked imediatly...

[10:10:42] <fila> Does anyone know is there any polyfill for css3 animation
[10:35:05] <tandroid> Does anyone know what the performance implications are of binding multiple resize() events on the window rather than just one?
[10:35:46] <tandroid> I'm trying to help my team write better javascript and I'm having trouble making a case for that one besides just code organization.
[10:36:17] <tandroid> Which actually probably should be a good enough case.
[10:42:02] <Dev0n> I'm obviously doing this wrong but I assumed that using "memory" in jQuery.Callbacks() would pass the initial value through all the added functions?  http://jsbin.com/zufoyoqazudo/2/edit?js,console
[10:52:14] <Jamal1337> Hi, how can I get an object of an element with a certain class if i click on an element inside a div and the object i want to get is some parent and child divs away?
[10:53:39] <tandroid> Jamal1337: .parent() or parents() and then .find()
[10:54:10] <tandroid> parents goes up find or children goes down.
[10:54:47] <tandroid> But if it's that far away, you might be better of doing a new jquery selector and finding one of the parent's of the element you want to change on click.
[10:55:38] <tandroid> Or save the common parent element in a variable and then use .find() to get your element with the click event and the one you want to change.
[10:56:35] <Jamal1337> tandroid: I'm currently using parent and find but it won't return me the correct object. I then want to change the class of the found element, but it won't work
[10:57:10] <tandroid> Jamal1337: the common parent option is probably best.
[10:58:51] <Jamal1337> tandroid: yes the thing is that just using parent isn't enough. I first have to use parent to go out of the current div but then need to go into another div but I don't get that working :/
[11:01:30] <tandroid> Jamal1337: http://jsfiddle.net/qf1b6pzk/
[11:02:31] <tandroid> Isn't that what you are trying to do Jamal1337?
[11:07:35] <Jamal1337> tandroid: thanks that helped me, got it working!
[11:07:42] <tandroid> Great!
[11:10:57] <Greener> I want to have a user upload a file, the server modify it, and then the user download the new file, preferably without leaving the page (so, AJAX, which complicates that). One good way seems to be setting a hidden iframe's src to the django view that handles it.
[11:10:58] <Greener> However, I still need that view to have the user's file. Right now I just include it in a jquery ajax POST call, but I don't know how this would work. Any ideas?
[11:12:40] <shoky_> ytrezq: heh i got something working using js impl. of ffmpeg, and range header for the xhr. http://jsfiddle.net/tympjq5g/   the .js file is ~27 MB tho ;P
[11:18:09] <ytrezq> nice..., but I doubt my community will accept the commit on github....
[11:18:20] <ytrezq> :)
[11:18:35] <ytrezq> I'll try to see if I can compress it

[11:27:19] <Woet> ytrezq: do you have to repeat everything you say?
[11:29:07] <ytrezq> Woet: No I didn't : spell checking
[11:29:23] <Woet> there is no need to repeat the entire sentence to correct 1 typo
[11:44:38] <ytrezq> shoky_: Ok It is CPU emulator which run an ffmpeg binary...
[11:45:14] <ytrezq> So I'm considering the source language is C++ and no javascipt

[11:46:23] <Woet> ytrezq: please stop.
[11:46:49] <drej> lol
[11:48:01] <litropy> Makes me think he's using a disability assist program or something.
[11:50:20] <drej> maybe we all just jumped on a guy that doesnt have hands
[11:50:49] <drej> now i feel awful
[11:51:22] <BillCriswell> If I didn't have hands I'd be cranky as shit.
[11:58:31] <litropy> I'm using canvas to draw a bunch of circles as indicators for a photo slider. When I resize for the viewport (e.g. going from mobile portrait to mobile landscape), the circles get a bit squished or stretched, even though I clearRect then redraw after my containing div has resized $("#mybar").animate({...}, function(){clearRect and redraw happens here}); Anyone have any idea as to why?
[12:01:13] <litropy> Both the css and the canvas dimensions are square, confirmed from console.
[12:02:14] <litropy> And calling clearRect and redraw from the console doesn't help.
[12:02:28] <fila> I have to use two full page vertical slider in a page like in this screenshot http://cl.ly/image/2p2l0H3g3r1t , does anyone know if have any jquery plugin easy customizable for this , also it must work on phone/tablet with touch event
[12:03:28] <litropy> fila, two of them? In the same page?
[12:04:02] <fila> litropy: yes two sliders
[12:04:12] <fila> in homepage
[12:04:37] <litropy> fila, I'm using touchSwipe for my photo slider. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CEsQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awwwards.com%2Fdemo%2FtouchSwipe-gallery-demo.html&ei=KSEfVOHfGsasyATsjoCoCA&usg=AFQjCNEanq8Q1Ty8BJS44P5gNtxUoYzHjQ&sig2=HCxTClfPwfP3fDldUk4Jtg&bvm=bv.75775273,d.aWw
[12:04:40] <fila> cant find a good solution
[12:04:56] <litropy> Ugh why does google do that to us tese days
[12:04:57] <litropy> http://www.awwwards.com/touchswipe-a-jquery-plugin-for-touch-and-gesture-based-interaction.html
[12:05:18] <fila> litropy: thanks im goin to check it right now
[12:08:32] <litropy> fila, then it's just a matter of grabbing the position().top of each element and either animating (or setting css) for the top of each element in relation to that.
[12:09:54] <litropy> fila, but you have to do the dots as well. I don't know - I suppose there's a slider plugin somewhere, but I like doing it from scratch so that I learn something.
[12:09:59] <fila> litropy: yes got it, this is goin to help me thanks :)
[12:10:09] <litropy> fila, yw gl
[12:10:23] <fila> litropy: yes thats what im goin to do
[12:10:41] <shoky_> ytrezq: yes ffmpeg is written in C/asm
[12:18:21] <ytrezq> they were a Java library for this... There are many Java to JavaScript compiler which could do this only for some ko.
[12:18:48] <ytrezq> shoky_: You can look at the comment I wrote
[12:19:22] <Woet> ytrezq: how is this relevant to jQuery again?
[12:19:31] <shoky_> ytrezq: i saw it. i have nothing to reply ;p
[12:19:49] <shoky_> least you could do is vote me up for the effort :(
[12:20:12] <shoky_> and for the solution, as it does solve the problem you asked about ;p
[12:27:37] <ytrezq> shoky_: If you have too many upvote, you will get the bounty
[12:28:44] <shoky_> ...
[12:51:17] <Paradisee> how can i make the items dropped into the <div> draggable aswell? http://jsfiddle.net/Paradisee/hxttz0jx/4/
[12:57:10] <decx> no idea what that stuff in you draggable does but http://jsfiddle.net/hxttz0jx/6/
[13:05:10] <Paradisee> decx: thanks :D i could work on that could you posted
[13:10:30] <Paradisee> decx: each time i drag an element inside the div, it should has a different id
[13:11:14] <Paradisee> that's why i use stop: to make that
[13:16:03] <decx> that would happen on the drop event as well actually
[13:16:22] <decx> ie clone.prop('id','blah')
[13:16:37] <Paradisee> what do you mean
[13:16:55] <decx> what i wrote
[13:16:56] <Paradisee> i didn't code with jquery for a long time
[13:17:41] <Paradisee> i made a counter, but it will increse each time i drag an element elsewhere
[13:17:45] <Paradisee> or in the div
[13:18:00] <decx> just makes more sense in the dorp
[13:18:02] <decx> drop
[13:18:07] <decx> ie v
[13:18:07] <decx> [22:17:53] <decx> just makes more sense
[13:18:11] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/hxttz0jx/7/
[13:19:20] <Paradisee> im gonna use the class instead of the #light id
[13:19:30] <Paradisee> cus i have more than 1 element to make draggable
[13:19:45] <decx> good thing .is() is so easy to change then
[13:19:50] <decx> -.-
[13:20:05] <Paradisee> ofc
[13:20:26] <Paradisee> what does ui.helper.context.id do
[13:20:59] <decx> i just looked at helper and took the easiest thing to tell if the drop is from the id
[13:21:22] <decx> because when you drop a cloned thing you dont want the drop event to happen
[13:23:35] <Paradisee> btw, it doesn't work
[13:23:57] <Paradisee> continue to increse the counter id each time i drag and drop the items inside the div
[13:24:28] <decx> lies
[13:26:37] <Paradisee> decx: i'm not
[13:27:08] <Paradisee> i suppose it is cus, when i clone an element it still have the class .widget
[13:27:12] <Paradisee> so i should remove it before
[13:27:26] <decx> oh without #light
[13:27:33] <decx> yeah clone only kills the id
[13:27:37] <decx> just check another way
[13:28:12] <decx> like if (ui.draggable.closest('#widgets').length){
[13:28:30] <Paradisee> i removed the class
[13:29:40] <Paradisee> http://jsfiddle.net/Paradisee/hxttz0jx/8/
[13:30:37] <decx> already gave you the answer
[13:30:50] <aboudreault> any user of http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/ here? My datetimepicker is working well.... but the input value is never set apparently. (I see nothing in the text box neither)
[13:30:59] <grodt> hello, is there a way to give an element 3 classes, and use toggle to cycle through them if you click the body for example?
[13:31:10] <grodt> so each time I click, the class changes

[14:00:28] <Monotoko2> I'm using this bit of code: http://pastebin.com/YDTeiRcD - how would I evaluate if the button is clicked? (IE evaluate line 4)
[14:00:38] <Monotoko2> it's the "class" bit that's throwing me
[14:00:43] <Monotoko2> not sure how to evaluate a class :(
[14:04:08] <shoky_> `api hasClass @ Monotoko2
[14:04:08] <b-ot> Monotoko2: .hasClass(): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[14:05:19] <Monotoko2> thank you!

[14:52:23] <bobbobbins> hey, I’m having a strange issue, i have an onclick that is supposed to fire when a user clicks an anchor tag with a certain class on it, but if i remove the class, the onclick is still firing, a brief version of the code is here: http://pastebin.com/CaaegENW
[15:00:29] <scar> is there a way to smooth the scrolling on chrome like firefox has?
[15:00:55] <scar> css/js way, not a chrome extension
[15:20:36] <kevireilly> bobbobbins: you probably need to remove the event listener alongside removing the class
[15:21:45] <bobbobbins> kevireilly: yeah, i just figured it out, i wasn’t binding it properly, changing it to $(‘a’).on(‘click’,’.inactive’,…); worked
[15:22:07] <kevireilly> ah gotcha
[18:54:08] <sammych> how do you check if your web app has internet connectivity?
[18:54:33] <sammych> as distinct from LAN connectivity
[18:54:41] <sammych> VPN, etc
[18:55:37] <sammych> can't AJAX 'ping' servers because cross-origin, etc
[19:46:22] <bobbobbins> im using jquery validator but it seems to only work intermittently, anyone else have this problem or know how to fix it?
[19:52:41] <naomi> bobbobbins can you paste a full problem
[19:52:46] <naomi> on a pastebin somewhere
[19:52:55] <naomi> saying "it doesn't work" doesn't allow us to help you
[19:53:32] <bobbobbins> yeah, im trying to put a jsfiddle together for it
[20:05:38] <bobbobbins> http://jsfiddle.net/dyqs5h17/1/
[20:06:19] <bobbobbins> so if you hit submit on that form, only email gets flagged
[20:06:37] <bobbobbins> but all except the ext field should
[20:06:56] <bobbobbins> (ignore the terrible html, i didn’t put together the actual form)
[21:49:11] <ISmithers> Hey all, I have a gallery I've created with controls handled by jQuery. It's halfway down my site page, and when I click to the next or prev image button, the page jumps back to the very top. What could cause this?
[21:50:49] <ISmithers> Oh, think I found it. My handler needs to return 'false' apparently.
[21:51:00] <Uhkis> your link is something# and you're not using preventDefault ?
[21:55:58] <ISmithers> Thanks Uhkis, I was using an anchor tag, but I believe your answer is correct for buttons. Appreciated! :>
[21:56:40] <Uhkis> np
[22:20:43] <klurbin> I'm using jquery-ui tooltips with AJAX content. Each tooltip reads the contents of the table cell under the mouse (for MAC address column) then makes an $.get to receive an HTML snippet for the tooltip. It works but for each table cell, the tooltip doesn't appear until the second time I mouse over it.

[22:28:57] <RedHatter> I have some elements that change position on hover (using css3 transitions) and overlap another element. I would like to use jquery to slide the overlaped element over as the anaimated element moves into position.
[22:29:12] <RedHatter> what I have is here http://dunamixdanceproject.com/portal.php
[22:30:28] <RedHatter> by using a hover and animate I can get the overlaped element to move but not in sync with the hoved element
[22:31:20] <RedHatter> Basicly I, if you look at the link, I want the links on the side to push the logo element over when they overlap,
[22:40:10] <naomi> RedHatter jesus there's s much animation
[22:40:15] <naomi> just because you can animate things doesn't mean you have to
[22:40:30] <naomi> this site is so inaccessible
[22:41:36] <RedHatter> naomi, it's only the portal or menu page, the rest of the site isn't going to have so much.
[22:42:15] <RedHatter> naomi, besides, it's what the client wanted.
[22:43:29] <naomi> RedHatter but it's your responsibility to steer the client away from wanting such things
[22:43:37] <naomi> you're the professional ! ^.^
[22:43:50] <naomi> anyway, don't listen to me
[22:44:02] <naomi> i'm in a bad mood because i can't figure out how to get webpack to bundle my app the way i want
[23:15:10] <misc--> hi there... I'm trying to work out how to hide a certain element. The html looks like this: <div id='order-details'><img class='connector' data-tooth-number="0" data-type="nodes" title="0" style="position:absolute; left:47px; top:139px;" src="/images/nodes/0.png"></img></div>
[23:15:44] <misc--> I can hide it like this: $('[class="connector"][data-tooth-number='0'][data-type="nodes"]').hide();             # but how can I reference it with the id #order-details too?
[23:16:27] <misc--> (because I have some other html with the same class that I don't want to hide, outside of that ID... so I want to reference just the classes contained within the id)
[23:29:25] <blackkbot> div#order-details+img.connector[data-tooth-number=0][data-type=nodes][title=0]
[23:29:42] <blackkbot> or maybe >
[23:29:46] <blackkbot> instead of the +
[23:39:33] <blackkbot> '#order-details>.connector[data-tooth-number="0"][data-type="nodes"][title="0"]' works
[23:47:58] <misc--> ok thanks blackkbot =)
