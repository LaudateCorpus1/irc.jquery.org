[00:00:02] <mulch2> ended up overriding the console log -- or wrapping it -- and calling my function on every new message. the function checks for an existence of an elem and only runs if it doesn't exist.
[00:00:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[00:01:01] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[00:01:25] <robertmaxrees> why not just subscribe to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/onmessage ?
[00:02:26] <mulch2> i mean, lmao, that's kinda what i was asking
[00:02:33] <robertmaxrees> when?
[00:03:25] <mulch2> mulch2 | robertmaxrees -- last question of the day: referring back to stomp and the websocket messages i'm seeing in my console, is there a way to use jquery to listen for those?
[00:03:36] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change my answer earlier.
[00:03:40] <robertmaxrees> you can't use jquery for that.
[00:04:12] <robertmaxrees> since it's not really part of the DOM api.
[00:04:18] <mulch2> then i'd need to research on how to subscribe
[00:04:39] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/LMIxWC8.png
[00:04:46] <mulch2> onmessage is waaay more ideal
[00:04:47] <robertmaxrees> right there on the page i linked.
[00:05:12] <robertmaxrees> just gotta define the function for that property on the object.
[00:05:13] <robertmaxrees> done.
[00:05:33] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - don't ever redefine things like console.log() - it's a really, really bad idea.
[00:05:50] <mulch2> where would this code go?
[00:05:57] <mulch2> and okay
[00:06:02] <robertmaxrees> in a js file?
[00:06:07] <robertmaxrees> (that's a vague question)
[00:06:24] <mulch2> lol, you're right
[00:06:44] <mulch2> in a doc ready method?
[00:06:59] <robertmaxrees> dunno - depoends on where the websocket is getting created.
[00:07:52] <mulch2> and i need to get the name of the socket, i imagine?
[00:08:11] <robertmaxrees> somewhere in your code there's something like var aWebSocket = new WebSocket('/foo') going on.  so you'd need to attach it within whatever scope that var exists in.
[00:08:20] <mulch2> ah, okay
[00:08:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd read the docs at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/WebSocket and head over to ##javascript for more information.
[00:08:48] <mulch2> thanks again for the direction
[00:10:50] <robertmaxrees> a much more effective way to ask for help in cases like that is to say something like "i'm trying to do x.  how can i do that?"  when you scope the question to just "jquery", the assumption is that you've already looked for other ways to do it and are purely curious about a jquery-fied route.
[00:11:35] <robertmaxrees> just to help you avoid cunfusion in the future :)
[00:12:31] <mulch2> that makes sense; i'm sorry.
[00:12:48] <robertmaxrees> just trying to help you not waste time :)
[00:12:54] <robertmaxrees> *waste your own time, that is.
[00:12:54] <mulch2> i appreciate that you never go full savage.
[00:13:04] <mulch2> you have a lot of patience.
[00:13:31] <robertmaxrees> we were all beginners once
[00:13:34] <mulch2> i don't want to give the impression that i'm lazy or not interested in learning.
[00:14:50] <mulch2> why is redefining console.log such a bad idea?
[00:15:01] <robertmaxrees> nor are you - just providing feedback on how to better frame those convos.  otherwise you're unintentioanlly communicating intent/knowldge.
[00:15:11] <robertmaxrees> and you should never redefine any object that isn't yours.
[00:16:06] <robertmaxrees> you can't rely on its existence or implementation.  there are some places, for instance, where console.log may not be defined at all.
[00:16:30] <mulch2> ahh
[00:50:49] <jak2000> hi all https://jsfiddle.net/L9qde0n7/    when user click on image need open a new window with new image size, how to do?
[00:51:29] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 so you want to open the image in a new window basically?
[00:56:01] <jak2000> yes
[00:56:25] <robertmaxrees> first off: var url = $(this).attr('target', '_blank');
[00:56:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[00:56:49] <robertmaxrees> target is for <a> elements, not images.  but also, why are you setting url to the return of setting the target attribute?
[00:57:14] <jak2000> i read an example on the net...
[00:57:27] <robertmaxrees> where they set the target attribute on an image tag?
[00:57:43] <robertmaxrees> second off, why not just wrap the image in an <a> tag that links to the image?
[00:58:32] <jak2000> https://www.researchgate.net/post/How-can-I-open-an-image-with-a-new-separate-window-larger-than-the-original-using-JavaScript-codes-only-JQuery-without-Html-and-JavaScript
[00:58:42] <jak2000> ok test with an <a>
[00:58:53] <robertmaxrees> that guide doesn't say to put target on the iamge.
[00:59:27] <jak2000> in the samples...
[00:59:36] <jak2000> then i use <a>
[00:59:54] <robertmaxrees> that example doesn't make sense fwiw.
[01:00:04] <jak2000> <a href="https://www.qries.com/"><img alt="Qries" src="https://www.qries.com/images/banner_logo.png" width="50" height="70"><a>
[01:00:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:00:17] <jak2000> in the href="" which vale recommend me?
[01:00:40] <robertmaxrees> the image...?
[01:00:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c6z18pn4/1/
[01:02:15] <jak2000> open the new window but not with the image.... (i want, the result, increase 150% the size of the image) is possible?
[01:02:36] <robertmaxrees> my fiddle works fine here.
[01:02:44] <robertmaxrees> why are you making a small image bigger?
[01:03:27] <jak2000> because i have mm by sample 10 small images, then user choose 1 and want see more bigger
[01:03:43] <robertmaxrees> are they data-uris like in that fiddle?
[01:03:52] <jak2000> yes
[01:03:54] <jak2000> base64
[01:03:58] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense heh
[01:04:11] <robertmaxrees> displaying an image larger than its resolution isn't going to look very good.
[01:04:15] <robertmaxrees> it'll just be pixelated.
[01:04:45] <jak2000> yes understand, but, if user upload a poor image resolution, is problem of the user
[01:05:05] <robertmaxrees> if you just open the image directly in a new window, it will display as large as it needs to.
[01:05:09] <robertmaxrees> problem solved :)
[01:05:32] <jak2000> ok
[01:05:46] <jak2000> in the first <a can i resize the image (smaller) ?
[01:05:54] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[01:05:58] <robertmaxrees> like, in the first page?
[01:06:08] <jak2000> yes
[01:06:15] <robertmaxrees> sure.  just use CSS?
[01:16:14] <jak2000> ok or width height
[01:16:31] <robertmaxrees> don't use those attributes :)
[01:16:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c6z18pn4/2/
[01:16:40] <robertmaxrees> use css.
[01:20:55] <jak2000> ok
[01:24:41] <jak2000> strange: xhtml += "<div class='col-lg-1'><a class='image-container' href='data:image/jpg;base64, " + b64 + "'></a></div>";    not display the iamge......
[01:24:51] <jak2000> but this yes: xhtml += "<div class='col-lg-1'><img class='img-responsive clImg' src='data:image/jpg;base64, " + b64 + "'/></div>";
[01:24:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:25:13] <robertmaxrees> "not display the image" meaning you can't see the image on the page with the first one?
[01:25:19] <jak2000> yes cant see the image
[01:25:25] <robertmaxrees> why would you be able to?
[01:25:33] <robertmaxrees> you have an empty link there.
[01:25:34] <jak2000> but if inspect the element and click on link it was displayed
[01:25:48] <robertmaxrees> ... becuase you're setting the href of a link.
[01:26:00] <robertmaxrees> why would the first one show the image?
[01:26:40] <jak2000> see: https://postimg.cc/BPFchs8x
[01:26:52] <robertmaxrees> ...
[01:26:56] <robertmaxrees> it's an empty <a> tag.
[01:27:06] <robertmaxrees> why would an empty <a> show anything?
[01:27:33] <jak2000> where is empty?
[01:27:35] <jak2000> see the image?
[01:27:45] <robertmaxrees> the image is set in the href attribute.
[01:28:00] <robertmaxrees> do you know what an <a> tag is?
[01:28:07] <robertmaxrees> and how that differs from an <img>?
[01:28:59] <robertmaxrees> you're basically doing this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/muLj7o3d/
[01:29:28] <robertmaxrees> and wondering why nothing is displaying.  it's because you have an empty <a>.  <a> doesn't display antyhing unless you put content between the opening and closing tags.
[01:30:28] <jak2000> escuse me, not see an empty <a>
[01:30:42] <robertmaxrees> in that fiddle?
[01:31:08] <jak2000> see please: https://postimg.cc/BPFchs8x
[01:31:08] <robertmaxrees> by "empty" i mean "there's nothing between the opening and closing tags".
[01:31:15] <robertmaxrees> that's an empty a tag.
[01:31:19] <robertmaxrees> you've only set the href.
[01:31:25] <robertmaxrees> nothing between the opening and closing tagsd.
[01:31:36] <robertmaxrees> same with <a href="https://www.google.com"></a>
[01:34:08] <jak2000> i have this: <a class='image-container' href='data:image/jpg;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAoAAAAKACAIAAACDr............... ></a></div>
[01:34:16] <robertmaxrees> correct.  an empty <a>
[01:35:09] <jak2000> which is bad?
[01:35:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how to make this any simpler.  without anything between the opening and closing tags of an <a>, nothing will display.
[01:35:20] <robertmaxrees> just like <a href="foo"></a>
[01:35:32] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter what's in the href - the href is a link.
[01:36:20] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what an <a> tag is?
[01:36:55] <jak2000> yes..
[01:37:06] <robertmaxrees> so what's the href attribute of an <a>?
[01:37:24] <jak2000> is a link.
[01:37:28] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[01:37:37] <robertmaxrees> so why would the href, in this case, suddenly display something?
[01:37:41] <robertmaxrees> when it never does anywhere else?
[01:38:13] <robertmaxrees> that's why you need to put an <img> within he <a> like i showed you earlier.
[01:39:24] <jak2000> ok, understand now :)
[01:39:27] <jak2000> thanks
[01:39:52] <robertmaxrees> k
[01:40:21] <robertmaxrees> I'd highly suggest doing a web development basics course - things like this are pretty fundamental to understand.
[01:41:24] <jak2000> :)
[01:41:39] <robertmaxrees> which is why i've been suggesting you do it for years now ;)
[02:03:06] <jak2000> yes :)
[02:03:17] <jak2000> testing the idea...: "<a href=\"data:image/png;base64," + imageData + "\"><img src=\"data:image/png;base64," + imageData + "\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\"/></a>"
[02:03:46] <robertmaxrees> why are you using height and width attributes?
[02:03:53] <jak2000> without: width=\"200\" height=\"150\"
[02:03:56] <jak2000> removed :)
[02:03:59] <robertmaxrees> uh huh
[02:04:23] <jak2000> but is the idea right?
[02:04:30] <robertmaxrees> also: if you use single quotes around the string, you don't need to escape every double quote.
[02:04:48] <robertmaxrees> var foo = '<div class="bar">some text</div>';
[02:05:06] <jak2000> ok
[02:05:40] <robertmaxrees> but sure.  though I'd have the "imageData" also contain the 'data:image' etc stuff.
[02:11:25] <robertmaxrees> something like https://bpa.st/QKDQ
[02:11:49] <robertmaxrees> (or change where you declare 'imageData' to just include it from the get-go.
[02:16:27] <jak2000> ok
[02:16:28] <jak2000> thanks
[02:20:00] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c6z18pn4/1/   your link is an empty <a></a> ?
[02:20:17] <robertmaxrees> ...
[02:20:22] <robertmaxrees> we just talked about this.
[02:20:52] <jak2000> if yes why display the image?
[02:21:15] <robertmaxrees> it's not an empty <a>
[02:21:20] <robertmaxrees> see the <img> tag in there?
[02:21:39] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/KeW441p.png
[02:21:46] <jak2000> oo yes
[02:22:01] <jak2000> :)
[02:22:03] <robertmaxrees> how would an empty <a> work??
[02:22:12] <jak2000> sorry escuse me
[02:22:22] <robertmaxrees> again, webdev 101 course :)
[02:22:38] <jak2000> 2021 course :)
[02:23:17] <robertmaxrees> uh huh.
[02:33:09] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c6z18pn4/1/
[02:33:13] <jak2000> which is bad?
[02:33:29] <jak2000> sorry bad link
[02:35:04] <robertmaxrees> ?
[02:37:23] <jak2000> forget bad paste
[02:37:54] <robertmaxrees> Ok...
[02:49:01] <jak2000> is possible catch 2 clicks on an input text?
[02:49:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[02:49:49] <jak2000> yes in Delphi exist a event called DblClick
[02:50:03] <robertmaxrees> why do you care about double clicks?
[02:50:09] <robertmaxrees> (context is critical)
[02:50:46] <jak2000> only other way for do a job
[02:50:54] <jak2000> search, clear, fields, and so on
[02:51:03] <robertmaxrees> and again
[02:51:10] <robertmaxrees> why do you care about double clicks?
[02:51:24] <robertmaxrees> what do you want to have happen when the user double clicks?
[02:51:31] <jak2000> ajax call
[02:51:40] <jak2000> for search a value..
[02:51:50] <robertmaxrees> explain the flow here.
[02:51:55] <robertmaxrees> give me context and information.
[02:52:03] <jak2000> creating a fiddle
[02:55:14] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/yjrc9L4t/
[02:55:41] <robertmaxrees> you want to clear the input on double-click?
[02:56:25] <jak2000> yes
[02:56:28] <robertmaxrees> why??
[02:56:48] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason you don't see that kind of UI anywhere else.
[02:56:49] <jak2000> you mean why not a button?
[02:56:54] <robertmaxrees> neither.
[02:57:04] <robertmaxrees> double-click never means "delete text"
[02:57:48] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to find a "simple" way to delete the text?
[02:57:55] <jak2000> yes
[02:58:07] <robertmaxrees> ctrl+a followed by delete.
[02:58:08] <robertmaxrees> done.
[02:58:11] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[02:59:36] <jak2000> :)
[21:49:11] <firespeaker> is there a way to inspect $.data() values using common browsers' inspection tools?
[21:49:43] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jquery's .data() method, not that i'm aware of.  you'll need to just read them back out using .data() again.
[21:50:34] <firespeaker> yeah but things seem to be disappearing :(
[21:50:40] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[21:51:11] <firespeaker> I set some .data() to some values that I've checked a million times and then later when I call it, only some of them are there
[21:51:20] <firespeaker> I'm obviously doing something wrong
[21:51:31] <firespeaker> but it would be good to have a tool to debug it
[21:51:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that shouldn't happen.  can you show an example in jsfiddle?
[21:51:50] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise, console.log($('foo').data('bar')); should be plenty.
[21:51:53] <firespeaker> not sure how minimal I can make it
[21:51:59] <firespeaker> yeah
[21:52:09] <robertmaxrees> also: are you removing/moving these elements at any point?
[21:52:44] <firespeaker> oh hm
[21:52:56] <firespeaker> not between when they get set and when I try to recall them, no
[21:53:06] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  would have to see it.
[21:57:17] <firespeaker> hmm, I'm calling the object with $.each
[21:57:39] <firespeaker> so it's technically not pulling the jquery object, but giving me flat DOM
[21:57:44] <robertmaxrees> are you using $.each() and $.data(), or $('foo').each() and $('foo').data()?
[21:57:45] <firespeaker> sorry, flat html maybe?
[21:58:02] <firespeaker> 		$.each($(".highlightedline"), function(i, line) {
[21:58:02] <firespeaker> 			console.log($(line), $(line).data("pair"));
[21:58:10] <robertmaxrees> don't use $.each() like that.
[21:58:13] <firespeaker> aha
[21:58:17] <robertmaxrees> $('.highlghtedline).each()
[21:58:27] <robertmaxrees> $(this).data('pair');
[21:58:42] <robertmaxrees> that may not fix it, but $.each() is a general utility method, not meant for jquery collections.
[21:58:49] <firespeaker> someone should update https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[21:58:55] <firespeaker> oh, I see
[21:59:16] <robertmaxrees> err, that page mentions it.
[21:59:48] <robertmaxrees> maybe not explicitly, but it does make the distinction for you :)
[21:59:56] <firespeaker> hm, same behaviour
[22:00:06] <firespeaker> 		$(".highlightedline").each(function() {
[22:00:06] <firespeaker> 			console.log($(this), $(this).data("pair"));
[22:00:09] <firespeaker> is what I have now
[22:00:20] <firespeaker> the first one has the data, the rest do not
[22:00:29] <robertmaxrees> how are you setting the .data()?
[22:01:12] <firespeaker> 		var lineObject = makeConnectLine(slEl, tlEl, "#00AAAA", 2).data("pair", pair);
[22:01:13] <firespeaker> 		console.log(lineObject, pair, lineObject.data("pair"));
[22:01:13] <firespeaker> 		$("#align-row").append(lineObject);
[22:01:24] <firespeaker> here they all have the data
[22:01:52] <robertmaxrees> what is  makeConnectLine(slEl, tlEl, "#00AAAA", 2) ?  i'm curious because you mentioned that only the first one has the data attribute.
[22:01:55] <firespeaker> oh!
[22:02:20] <robertmaxrees> ?
[22:02:20] <firespeaker> it's rerunning that creation line in the .each
[22:02:30] <firespeaker> I bet that's the problem
[22:02:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i feel like i'm missing some critical information here.
[22:02:49] <firespeaker> put my update line outside of the each loop, 1min
[22:03:32] <firespeaker> yep, that works
[22:03:47] <firespeaker> there's way too much context is the problem
[22:03:52] <firespeaker> and no debug tool :(
[22:04:11] <robertmaxrees> can look for a "debug tool" - should be able to set a watch on that .data(), as well.
[22:04:27] <firespeaker> oh?  how's a watch work?
[22:05:06] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with your browser's debugger?
[22:06:17] <robertmaxrees> not the console, but the "set breakpoints and watch expressions" debugger.
[22:07:04] <firespeaker> ah, I am not
[22:07:07] <firespeaker> sounds useful
[22:07:27] <robertmaxrees> incredibly.  i'd spend some time in there and learn the tools :)  helps a ton in cases like this.
[22:08:16] <firespeaker> I mean having a bunch of console output was what helped in the end
[22:08:18] <firespeaker> same basic idea
[22:08:34] <robertmaxrees> sort of.  but being able to pause execution and go line-by-line is also very useful.
[22:08:44] <firespeaker> I was like "this is annoying that it outputs that one set of stuff every time through the loop and separates the things I want to see————oh!"
[22:09:17] <firespeaker> yeah, next time I might try that
[22:10:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
