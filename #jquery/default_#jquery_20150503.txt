[00:29:10] <Justice> Hey guys, are there any Jquery tooltip plugins that work well with parallax design?
[00:29:20] <Justice> Only one I could find that might work is: http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/
[00:32:24] <oxguy3> have you looked at hubspot's tooltip? http://github.hubspot.com/tooltip/docs/welcome/
[00:32:55] <Justice> No, I'm actually looking for my dev
[00:33:02] <Justice> Since the current plugin we use doesnt seem to have the functionality
[00:33:23] <oxguy3> i meant, hubspot's tooltip might do the job you want
[00:33:23] <sadtaco> How do I traverse up through not just parents but parents of parents to find all matches?
[00:33:27] <sadtaco> Like a closest that doesn't stop
[00:33:37] <oxguy3> havent worked with that plugin specifically, but hubspot makes good stuff in my experience
[00:33:42] <Justice> sweet thanks oxguy3
[00:33:45] <Justice> i'll send the link over to him
[00:33:47] <oxguy3> np justice :)
[00:34:05] <oxguy3> doesnt the .parents() method do that sadtaco?
[00:34:16] <sadtaco> Seems to only be one level up
[00:34:35] <sadtaco> wait..
[00:34:37] <sadtaco> hm..
[00:34:38] <oxguy3> .parent() only goes up one level, but .parents() should go up the entire tree
[00:34:39] <sadtaco> Oh I see my problem
[00:34:41] <oxguy3> http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[00:34:54] <sadtaco> Was unrelated to my actual question.
[00:34:59] <sadtaco> I'll figure it out
[00:35:02] <oxguy3> oh haha :)
[02:50:29] <nikio_> how to smoothly transition between two numbers without blocking the javascript thread?
[03:19:01] <quackgyver> https://jsfiddle.net/8qmemmu0/
[03:19:03] <quackgyver> why isnt this working
[03:20:58] <tocka> quackgyver
[03:21:03] <tocka> because you havent selected any library
[03:21:16] <tocka> top right corner
[03:21:17] <quackgyver> it still isnt working
[03:24:40] <tocka> quackgyver
[03:24:42] <tocka> here yo ugo
[03:24:42] <tocka> https://jsfiddle.net/8qmemmu0/1/
[03:24:55] <tocka> you were missing # when calling menu
[03:25:03] <tocka> and you were missing the event
[03:25:05] <tocka> :)
[03:25:13] <quackgyver> oh yeah
[03:25:14] <quackgyver> im an idiot
[03:25:20] <tocka> haha
[03:25:24] <tocka> happens to all of us!
[03:25:24] <tocka> :)
[03:26:12] <quackgyver> it shouldnt need event though
[03:26:21] <tocka> it should:)
[03:26:28] <tocka> you are using event.preventDefault
[03:26:34] <tocka> you could use a.preventDefault
[03:26:42] <tocka> but a would have to be in the function as the event is now
[03:26:43] <tocka> :)
[03:27:02] <quackgyver> your example works if i remove event from the function though
[03:27:10] <quackgyver> but it doesnt work if i implement it on my site without event
[03:27:13] <quackgyver> thats weird o_O
[03:27:41] <tocka> you dont need that event at all
[03:27:48] <tocka> if you would have a href="something"
[03:27:50] <tocka> then yes :)
[03:28:21] <tocka> https://jsfiddle.net/8qmemmu0/2/
[03:32:10] <quackgyver> ah ok
[03:32:12] <quackgyver> thanks pal :)

[05:34:26] <end-of-file> Hi guys, I have a problem and I hope someone can help me!! On my website, I have a topbar menu  (mobileflu...etc) stick on scroll page. I want the real menu (home, etc) stick on scroll too after the topbar, like this: http://goo.gl/0TxKLW . This is website url: http://goo.gl/q6iaFV ... thanks!
[06:13:52] <ravindra> hello i need to ask a question is anyone can solve my prob
[06:14:30] <Azrael_-> ravindra: don't ask to ask, just ask
[06:16:04] <ravindra> thanks! i am using append function which trigger when any img click and append on text area but when i write something on text area and then click on image it is not appending anything
[06:22:21] <OurRoyalGabe> try using alert
[06:22:25] <OurRoyalGabe> see if it triggers for that
[06:22:31] <OurRoyalGabe> if not, it is not listening
[06:22:51] <OurRoyalGabe> paste your code into paste.ofcode.org or somewhere it can be looked at
[06:23:08] <ravindra> sorry guys! my friend was outside and now wait i paste my code
[06:23:49] <OurRoyalGabe> Did he bring any pot?
[06:24:34] <ravindra> lolz! he just alert me that tomorrow is class test
[06:25:04] <OurRoyalGabe> cool I'd might be able to pass your class if I were in it
[06:25:20] <ravindra> yup m in 12th
[06:26:56] <ravindra> http://paste.ofcode.org/jSRJPAzTZcLThUS6cnRXDQ
[06:27:22] <OurRoyalGabe> $('#emotions').hide(); $('.emotion'
[06:27:25] <OurRoyalGabe> one is . and one is #
[06:27:29] <OurRoyalGabe> one is a class, one is an ID
[06:27:32] <OurRoyalGabe> those are different
[06:27:35] <OurRoyalGabe> choose one
[06:27:44] <OurRoyalGabe> probably ID, since you need one that is defined once, not used all over
[06:28:29] <ravindra> no it is different funtion and it is working properly
[06:28:43] <OurRoyalGabe> ahh got ya
[06:29:04] <OurRoyalGabe> did you try $(this).toggle
[06:29:29] <ravindra> .emotion is the class of anchor tag which on click show/hide the div having id of emotions
[06:30:03] <ravindra> I have problem with last function
[06:31:41] <ravindra> .bb is class of img tag which on click append the title in the textarea and it is working fine. But when i input text in textarea and then click the img it is not appending
[06:33:59] <PiL> ravindra: canyou make a jsfiddle?
[06:34:20] <ravindra> http://paste.ofcode.org/jSRJPAzTZcLThUS6cnRXDQ
[06:36:38] <PiL> ravindra: will $(this).attr('title'); always return a string?
[06:37:12] <PiL> are you using chrome? set a breakpoint and see if it is a string type
[06:39:14] <ravindra> PiL: yes it always return a string and when i click on img without typing anything in textarea it is appending but when i type something and then append it is not appending
[06:41:00] <PiL> 1. grab the text from the textarea. 2. clear the textarea 3. string concatenate the title and grabbed text 4. append that
[06:41:31] <ravindra> let i try that also
[06:43:00] <PiL> hello all, can i change the position of a div(using .css) after i use the append?
[06:47:46] <decx> use css() before the append
[06:52:21] <PiL> decx: you see i add the div with append, and then attempt to move it using css. reversing the order will not help. i would be trying to move a div that has not been appended to the dom at that time
[06:53:53] <decx> when you append your div your dom changes and there's gonna be a page reflow, you can add inline styles to "virtual elements" just fine without having to reflow multiple times
[06:54:25] <decx> see when you css() after append() then it's most likey another layout trashing
[06:55:00] <decx> these are advanced techniques but it's still good to look out for
[06:55:51] <PiL> decx: thanks off to try it now
[06:59:53] <ravindra> Hey PiL I got the answer for my problem http://www.ciiycode.com/06Nz6WxgxPqU/jquery-append-not-appending-to-textarea-after-text-edited
[07:01:44] <PiL> decx:this div will be moved many times with .css position properties. is it still good to use?
[07:03:21] <decx> how often
[07:03:24] <PiL> what would you suggest for moving a div around alot at compile time
[07:03:32] <PiL> regularly
[07:03:37] <PiL> im sorry at run time
[07:04:01] <decx> only fall back to position on old browsers and use translate3d instead
[07:04:13] <decx> cause that's hardware acc
[07:04:45] <PiL> sweet, is it jqeury?
[07:04:54] <decx> that's just css
[07:05:45] <PiL> oh, ok. what i really want to do is to move around "tiles" with a mouse
[07:06:20] <decx> what like a puzzle game?
[07:07:59] <PiL> decx: not exactly
[07:08:21] <PiL> i dont drag and drop, if i move my mouse north, it will move all the tiles south, and vice versa
[07:08:47] <PiL> i had something like that working, but i did not use append, i just hardcoded the div inside
[07:08:51] <decx> so you move stuff based on mousemove or in a timer?
[07:09:23] <PiL> decx: mousemove
[07:10:11] <decx> yeah try translate
[07:10:59] <PiL> decx: so i use this with append?
[07:12:54] <decx> i suggets you put up a fiddle
[07:12:55] <decx> ^^
[07:13:06] <decx> this is getting increasingly theoretic
[07:13:13] <PiL> decx: this is going to take a moment
[07:15:29] <PiL> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=kdKvw6JHjG
[07:19:49] <decx> that's not exactly a localized problem
[07:19:57] <decx> it's too sunday for me to dig through that :D
[07:20:19] <PiL> sure, stay with me for a moment
[07:22:14] <decx> stick with the position for now, once that works you can still change to translate
[07:29:36] <Deithrian> I am at a total loss ass to why this code executes on reloading the page, but never when resizing the actual window :/ can someone explain please? http://pastebin.com/pu2gcNfG
[07:37:19] <decx> PiL: so do you want to move embed or cell?
[07:37:37] <PiL> decx: cell
[07:37:46] <decx> then what's the deal with .embed
[07:42:13] <PiL> decx: thank you
[07:42:24] <decx> ok we have something happening
[07:42:25] <decx> ^^
[07:42:54] <decx> is that being synced?
[07:43:00] <decx> jstogether is weirding me out
[07:44:07] <PiL> decx: thanks are there any books you suggest?
[07:44:43] <decx> get the basics from javascript books and learn jquery by doing it
[07:45:02] <decx> jquery books aren't worth the money
[07:45:37] <decx> http://eloquentjavascript.net
[07:48:51] <decx> Deithrian: you're not binding that function to resize, you are calling it
[07:49:18] <decx> use function(){ alert() } or write your own alert function that you can call without arguments
[07:51:47] <annoymouse> Hello
[07:52:14] <annoymouse> I am using touch events to control some animation on a canvas
[07:52:48] <annoymouse> The touchstart works perfectly, but when I try touchmove, the entire canvas gets highlighted or the page just scrolls
[07:53:08] <annoymouse> I read about e.preventDefault(), but I am unsure of how to use it in this case
[07:53:14] <annoymouse> Does anyone have a fix?
[07:53:23] <Oka> annoymouse: Can you show a snippet of your code?
[07:54:02] <decx> canvas.on('touchmove',function(e){ e.preventDefault() [...] })
[07:54:21] <annoymouse> Oka: Actually it's written in Processing.js… not sure if you know about it
[07:54:38] <decx> doesnt matter
[07:54:42] <annoymouse> decx: But wouldn't that disable the touchmove event entirely?
[07:54:46] <Oka> If it has events, it has events.
[07:54:51] <decx> yes when it's on your canvas
[07:55:09] <annoymouse> decx: But I need to be able to drag my finger on the canvas
[07:55:09] <decx> you can still do the math with the values it puts out
[07:55:23] <decx> but it wont scroll your window or select
[07:55:42] <annoymouse> decx: and Oka: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pzp1997/THE-SUN/gh-pages/sun.pde
[07:56:15] <annoymouse> decx: ah so it prevents the default behavior but the event is still fired?
[07:56:20] <Oka> Yes
[07:56:24] <annoymouse> duh that's the name of it lol
[07:56:28] <decx> ^^
[07:56:29] <Oka> it causes the default event handlers to be ignored
[07:56:36] <annoymouse> Thanks guys
[07:56:41] <annoymouse> Now let me try it
[07:56:44] <decx> processing should have an option for that though
[07:56:58] <annoymouse> decx: Not that I know of. Let me skim the docs though
[08:50:01] <ThePendulum> I am dynamically adding certain elements that I later want to call $().addClass on, but it doesn't seem to allow me to do that
[08:50:18] <ThePendulum> Is there anyway to ensure jQuery initialized the elements before setting $().addClass on it?
[08:50:42] <ThePendulum> $(this) frankly does work for the same elements
[08:57:20] <decx> later?
[09:09:35] <ThePendulum> decx: well, after those elements have been initialized
[09:15:24] <cobradabest> Is there a way to check if a link has been clicked on jQuery mobile?
[09:15:50] <cobradabest> I've tried to use the functions that were made for buttons, but I've not had much luck...
[09:20:39] <cobradabest> Sorry about that, Firefox/Chatzilla crashed, did anybody answer my question?
[10:37:07] <nak> i am having trouble with this (should be) simple cross-origin request: http://jsfiddle.net/0hra2ezs/
[10:37:09] <nak> can someone help me ?
[10:39:37] <nak> the request goes out, and the response comes back correctly, but jQuery is saying there's a parse error on the json response???
[10:42:41] <shoky> nak: the server is not returning a JSONP response, it's just returning JSON, so try  dataType: 'json'  or just leave out the dataType
[10:46:38] <nak> wow wtf
[10:46:48] <nak> i thought it needed jsonp for cross-origin ?
[10:47:25] <shoky> that's only needed if the server doesn't allow cross-origin requests, but allows it via JSONP.
[10:47:47] <nak> ok thanks shoky
[10:48:05] <shoky> np
[10:48:58] <ThePendulum> http://jsfiddle.net/auf6rj3j/ <-- I shoved my sound matrix in a fiddle and replaced the audio files with an oscillator so it makes sound (as it can't load the audio files)
[10:49:25] <ThePendulum> now on #48 and #54, the tiles are turned on or off visually by giving them the 'queued' class; this doesn't seem to work, however
[10:49:54] <ThePendulum> If I set this at the bottom in the click() event by using $(this), it does work
[10:50:13] <ThePendulum> the beat and note variable are correct as the actual sound does get added to the matrix
[10:50:22] <ThePendulum> (and they can be logged)
[10:51:10] <ThePendulum> in another jsFiddle I figured that it shouldn't be a problem to dynamically generate a bunch of elements with IDs and then call them with $('#someID'), so I don't know what's going on here
[10:51:19] <Crucials> that thing is fun to play with ThePendulum
[10:51:39] <ThePendulum> innit :D
[10:51:51] <ThePendulum> with the oscillators it goes apesh*t if you put more than 1 note per beat though
[10:51:59] <ThePendulum> with the sound files, that works fine; http://sandbox.unknown.name/matrix/
[10:52:15] <ThePendulum> however, it's hard to use without a visual representation of the notes you toggled
[10:52:20] <shoky> ThePendulum: it's because of the : in the id's
[10:52:33] <ThePendulum> shoky: didn't seem to make a difference
[10:53:13] <shoky> ThePendulum: $('#' + beat + '\\:' + note).addClass('queued');
[10:53:49] <ThePendulum> shoky: HUH, peculiar
[10:53:53] <ThePendulum> I replaced them with another character earlier
[10:53:55] <ThePendulum> and I had the same issue
[10:54:07] <ThePendulum> well, thanks :O
[10:54:12] <shoky> was probably another character that needs escaping in a selector ;p
[10:55:40] <ThePendulum> yeah, I tried '_' I think
[10:55:45] <ThePendulum> http://sandbox.unknown.name/matrix/#10000000:01000010:00100000:00010000:00001000:01000100:00000010:00000001
[10:55:48] <ThePendulum> so that works now
[10:55:56] <ThePendulum> it's linkable and they light up
[10:56:01] <ThePendulum> next step is to make that link prettier
[10:56:48] <shoky> it's pretty pretty as is ;p
[10:56:56] <ThePendulum> it has its charm, bit lengthy though :p
[11:21:21] <OurRoyalGabe> ThePendulum | http://sandbox.unknown.name/matrix/#00000001:10000000:01000000:00100000:01000010:00001000:01000100:00010000
[11:21:25] <OurRoyalGabe> I hooked it up
[11:21:34] <OurRoyalGabe> take that to Kanye WEst
[11:31:53] <ThePendulum> OurRoyalGabe: dammit, I broke it, I hope I can get it to work again
[11:31:57] <ThePendulum> because I'm curious what you did there
[11:32:15] <OurRoyalGabe> I clicked the stuff in and out
[11:32:20] <OurRoyalGabe> and the matrix changed
[11:35:47] <ThePendulum> OurRoyalGabe: yeah, but I broke that now
[11:36:08] <ThePendulum> I moved it to its own file and I'm trying to make it proper
[11:37:29] <EvilPenguin> hello /spell_menu
[11:42:24] <ThePendulum> yay it works again, let me see if it loads
[11:43:41] <ThePendulum> OurRoyalGabe: loaded that, dude you should contact a record label
[12:10:06] <acidjazz> ThePendulum / OurRoyalGabe a buddy of mine built this
[12:14:50] <user_corrupt> I have a link with target=_top to an index.php and I am wondering if it would be possible to use AJAX to wait until the page is loaded before opening it… I’m just trying to avoid the awkward 1.5 seconds of a blank page that happens when I click on the link
[12:16:34] <rcyr> user_corrupt: Sure, just change the window.top.location.href once it's loaded
[12:18:05] <rcyr> So basically, it would look like: $('#myLink').on('click', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); var link = this.href; $.ajax(theConfig).done(function(data) {  window.top.location.href = link;  });}) //something a bit like that
[12:18:22] <OurRoyalGabe> acidjazz | nice
[12:18:32] <OurRoyalGabe> ThePendulum | yeah they told me I suck
[12:18:38] <OurRoyalGabe> but I have a sound cloud none the less
[12:31:23] <ThePendulum> acidjazz: I'm sorry, what did this buddy build?
[12:37:29] <acidjazz> im trying to find it
[12:38:40] <user_corrupt> rcyr: I don’t really understand your suggestion yet, but here is what I am currently trying to do.  I’m using jquery.form.js and I have the following script below it: http://pastie.org/10127091 it’s working insomuch as it is trying to load the link via AJAX, although once the destination page gets loaded then I get a bunch of get -> 404 errors because the relative links to resources on that page are failing. Am I attampting to use a logical
[12:38:41] <user_corrupt> approach?
[12:52:10] <ThePendulum> acidjazz: what did it do / look like?
[13:01:28] <aca20031> If you jQuery(foo).bar = "pie". and then you later check jQuery(foo).bar, is it still set? e.g. is jQuery(foo) always the same intance if foo is the same?
[13:02:56] <rcyr> aca20031: No
[13:03:10] <aca20031> explains this problem, then :)
[13:05:23] <ThePendulum> I must say, this sound matrix can be mighty fast in oscillator mode
[13:05:27] <ThePendulum> http://sandbox.unknown.name/matrix/#00000001:00000010:00000100:00001000:00010000:00100000:01000000:10000000
[13:05:31] <ThePendulum> set the BPM in the bottom right to 1920
[13:05:33] <ThePendulum> works fine here
[13:05:48] <ThePendulum> (yeah, I'll include those settings in the link soon)
[13:06:38] <ThePendulum> 3840 works too, but the visuals disappear and the clicking takes over the bleeping
[13:08:27] <ThePendulum> hmm, it can't be stopped more than 6 times because on every stop, an oscillator doesn't get properly disconnected
[13:09:07] <ThePendulum> I have the same issue when adding more than 1 oscillator per beat; I can't stop the other ones
[13:17:04] <user_corrupt> I have a jqery ui modal window on a page, and it had been working fine until I started to open the page via AJAX.. I had to change all the resource links to absolute in order to not get 404 errors, and now the modal window opens, but when I try to click “no” I get the following error: http://pastie.org/10127189
[13:18:33] <marandi> hi guys , i have an array such as : var fn_data = {record_type: $('#record_type').val() ,zone: $('#zone').val()}; now i wanna add one more element to this array , what should i do ?!
[13:21:17] <user_corrupt> ok, it was because I was loading jquery twice
[13:24:46] <rcyr> marandi: fn_data not an array but an object. If you want to add more keys to the object, you can use the array-like notation fn_data['something'] = $('#whatever').val();
[13:28:23] <marandi> rcyr: cool , i got it , actually i use fn_data.something = blablah
[13:28:29] <marandi> thanks btw
[13:28:31] <rcyr> That also works.
[14:07:40] <AlphaAtom> I'm going to re-order a bunch of elements in the DOM when someone presses a link, is it possible to animate this shuffle? And if so, how might I go about it
[14:28:24] <last1> is there anything special to be done in Firefox in order to use delegate() on code added via .html() ?
[14:28:42] <last1> this code works fine in Chrome: $('#editadmin_form').delegate('a.enableAdmin', 'click', function (event) {
[14:29:06] <last1> but doesn't trigger at all in FF 34
[14:36:25] <shoky> last1: nope. works for me. (in ff 37)
[14:37:20] <last1> I updated too, but I can't get it to work
[14:37:23] <last1> what else can I try ?
[14:37:44] <shoky> make a jsfiddle that reproduces the problem
[14:37:54] <shoky> or a live link to a testcase
[14:38:29] <shoky> e.g. this one works  http://jsfiddle.net/3hab6f7v/
[14:45:43] <last1> that's *almost* the code I have
[14:46:18] <last1> only difference is that upon page load, a jquery code gets executed that gets data via json and only then the html() gets set
[15:07:53] <ThePendulum> Is there any way to detect when a user leaves the tab in jQuery?
[15:08:10] <ThePendulum> Seperately from $(window).blur that is also triggered when the tab is still exposed, but the browser window loses focus
[15:09:51] <user_corrupt> I have a page that exists within an iframe of a facebook canvas element.. when a link is clicked, then this page loads another page via AJAX (restricted to my own domain). I’m using jquery.form.js and this little script here: http://pastie.org/10128285#7 I would like to replace line 7 with a bit of code that will change the browser’s URL to my facebook canvas address. Is thi spossible?
[15:10:25] <stangeland> This is a snippet taken directly from FB documentation: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10981430/ Can anybody explain to me how line 62 has access to the FB object when its first loaded in line 69-75 ?
[15:13:40] <decx> ThePendulum: requestAnimationFrame will pause when you switch tabs
[15:14:32] <stangeland> anyone?
[15:14:47] <rcyr> stangeland: If you look at line 62, you'll see that it's part of the function at line 41
[15:15:07] <rcyr> stangeland: Right?
[15:15:17] <stangeland> rcyr, ahhh ok i did not see that
[15:15:47] <rcyr> So, 69-75 loads the FB code... and when it's loaded, the FB code calls fbAsyncInit itself
[15:16:01] <rcyr> Which is why FB is accessible at that point.
[15:20:46] <ThePendulum> decx: not quite sure how I'd apply that here
[15:21:40] <decx> you can wrap your timer in it
[15:21:58] <decx> or it in your timer
[15:22:05] <decx> dont know which way is preferred ^^
[15:24:09] <ThePendulum> decx: that actually worked, haha
[15:24:15] <ThePendulum> no idea why, but thanks anyway :D
[15:25:05] <decx> it waits for the browser to be ready for the next frame to draw
[15:25:34] <decx> you want your dom manipulation in there to prevent repaints and trashing
[15:25:51] <ThePendulum> it seems nasty to use it for something completely unrelated, but it works
[15:26:19] <decx> it's a bit iffy with sound which has to be timed consistently
[15:27:25] <ThePendulum> well it doesn't matter much here
[15:27:30] <ThePendulum> it just continues where it was left
[15:27:46] <ThePendulum> just goes on with the next pulse/beat
[15:28:45] <ThePendulum> what I have here is practically a MIDI player
[15:33:07] <decx> wonder what would happen if you have a 100x100 matrix and have it play a round of game of life every bar
[15:39:30] <user_corrupt> rcyr: I have the AJAX load of my link working, I am just having a hard time rewriting the URL after it is loaded… I’ve tried the following but that just opens another link: http://pastie.org/10128626#7
[15:45:49] <user_corrupt> ok, 	window.history.pushState("object or string", "Title", "/new-url");      does it, but not without destroying my modal window for some reason
[15:48:30] <user_corrupt> actually, even that is limited to my own domain
[16:00:42] <NBhosting> how do i remove the first element var allell = $(playerbase).children();
[16:22:48] <NBhosting> can i do this on 2 at once? $(".spikes .spikess").droppable({
[16:23:33] <Oka> Commas in a selector will select both sets of matching elements, if that's what you're asking
[16:23:54] <NBhosting> thanks
[16:26:55] <Oka> Also for your previous question, look into .first(), .last(), and .eq() methods for targetting a certain element in a set of matched elements
[16:27:01] <Oka> NBhosting: ^
[16:35:57] <NBhosting> thanks
[16:53:38] <path[l]> Hi, I’m using the accordion control of jquery UI, but my accordion is getting positioned above a div that’s before it in the page. Does it get absolutely positioned?
[17:08:32] <last1> why does the following work in Chrome but not in FF ?
[17:08:34] <last1> http://jsfiddle.net/3hab6f7v/9/
[17:08:49] <last1> I can tell it's because of the <button> field, but is that a bug ?
[17:10:38] <Woet> last1: that's invalid HTML.
[17:11:06] <last1> why is it invalid ?
[17:12:19] <Woet> last1: "The element a must not appear as a descendant of the button element."
[17:13:41] <Woet> last1: why do you need an a href anyways? .on('click') will work fine on a button element.
[17:13:49] <last1> putting <button> inside <a> indeed works in FF
[17:13:56] <last1> it threw me off that Chrome accepted that
[17:14:20] <Woet> chrome tends to try and fix your mistakes.
[17:14:39] <Woet> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16280684/nesting-a-inside-button-doesnt-work-in-firefox
[17:16:58] <last1> nice. thanks. confirmed as fixed!
[18:11:21] <gtwy> anyone around?
[18:11:46] <gtwy> this could be a jsfiddle issue but this code doesnt work and i cant find any legitimate reason why it doesnt
[18:11:52] <gtwy> http://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/6dz504z7/3/
[18:12:03] <gtwy> im just running through a practice example in a book
[18:12:35] <gtwy> nevermind
[18:12:36] <gtwy> i think i found it
[19:33:27] <aca20031> this is annoying. I want to have X elements animate and make a callback. Then I want to know when they are all done. This should be as easy as "animate++", and onDone { animate-- }, wait until animate == 0
[19:33:37] <aca20031> but I cant for the life of me figure out how to get the scoping of "animate" right
[19:34:07] <aca20031> I even tried element.get().objectWithAnimate = this; and then in the callback checking this.objectWithAnimate but nothing
[19:34:58] <aca20031> mm seems the problem is I need ot use get(0) or who knows what happens even though it should only have one elment in it
[19:35:06] <aca20031> This is still ugly as hell btw :)
[19:35:17] <pedrofernando94> Why wont you apply a class?
[19:35:27] <aca20031> for what purpose
[19:36:07] <pedrofernando94> You solved it then?
[19:36:18] <aca20031> yes, though it is rather fugly
[19:38:06] <aca20031> see the @@ lines -- is there no better way? os
[19:38:10] <aca20031> http://pastebin.com/WKcgXB1i
[19:40:36] <pedrofernando94> I think i still dont get you but here it goes
[19:40:50] <pedrofernando94> you can check it yourself in jquery documentation for animate
[19:40:53] <pedrofernando94> .animate( properties [, duration ] [, easing ] [, complete ] )
[19:41:26] <pedrofernando94> That function you pass in the last argument happens when animation is done
[19:41:46] <aca20031> ...yeah figured that out
[19:41:53] <aca20031> but you cannot pass it any context
[19:41:56] <pedrofernando94> So you dont need this.OnAnimateDone
[19:42:00] <aca20031> .
[19:43:47] <pedrofernando94> And the .done() method does not help you in that?
[19:45:43] <pedrofernando94> if you are doing this for animating one at a time you could use the queue attribute i think...
[19:46:18] <pedrofernando94> I cannot find the documentation for it now, but it is very helpfull when you try to achieve that... And much cleaner.
[19:48:49] <_August_> can someone take a quick look at my code? Im nesting ajax calls and im not sure the formatting is correct. The code works Im just not sure im doing it properly. http://pastebin.com/vQXSA7tq
[19:55:10] <pedrofernando94> One thing that i recon is that comments should have error method / callback too... ;)
[19:58:21] <_August_> yeah i havent made it that far into the call lol
[19:58:45] <_August_> i was looking at the format of it and i was like this looks ugly i wonder if im doing this correctly
[20:07:53] <felipedvorak> damn... I can't make jQuery work with firefox... everything is fine, works on Chrome... but on firefox nothing works...
[20:08:28] <felipedvorak> Is there a known bug with the $(document).ready(function(){}); way?
[20:08:47] <felipedvorak> Do I have to place the script tags at the end of my body invariably for it to work with firefox?
[20:09:14] * felipedvorak frustrated
[20:09:19] <rcyr> No, there's something wrong with your code but since I haven't seen it, I can't help
[20:12:48] <RFEIST> where is the best place to find info on jquery security vulnerabilities/changes ?
[20:21:57] <felipedvorak> and yes, my script taks are position css+jquery+localjs, the cdn is valid... i've tried substituting the $ for jQuery as something could be conflicting.. but its a very simple code as you can see..
[20:22:47] <rcyr> felipedvorak: I can't see your code, that's the problem.
[20:23:02] <rcyr> felipedvorak: Paste it on jsfiddle.net or something.
[20:23:58] <felipedvorak> rcyr: ow, I did 10 minutes ago but I guess there was some problem with my connection https://jsfiddle.net/fawL4yhs/
[20:25:53] <rcyr> felipedvorak: Unfortunately, your code works in both chrome and firefox for me :/
[20:26:03] <felipedvorak> :(
[20:28:31] <felipedvorak> just tried noConflict mode and nothing...
[20:31:24] <felipedvorak> I thought it could be conflicting with Pentadactyl or one of my Plugins, so just tried on another separate instance of firefox (firefox-developer edition this time, totally vanila) and nothing... still doesn't load...
[20:35:12] <felipedvorak> Alright, just loaded it locally and nothing...
[20:41:33] <felipedvorak> Well... gave up and placed my script tags at the end of the body and removed the document ready function and voila... works... i dont like my script tags there but this time the bug won... thanks anyway rcyr
[20:50:07] <pauled> Hi, I am looking script to redirect to sign in page after log out on github
[22:02:13] <quuxman> Is there a way to get something like a blob url that's mutable?
[22:51:04] <surianup> HI friends
[22:51:08] <surianup> How are you
[22:51:14] <surianup> I have an issue
[22:51:47] <surianup> I need to remove the "$250/n/a" /n/a if there is
[22:51:57] <surianup> how it be possible in Jquery
[22:51:58] <surianup> ?
[22:52:06] <surianup> can anyone let me know please
[22:52:19] <SirLagz> surianup: using .replace()
[23:34:56] <Verzlo> Hi, can somebody tell me why this won't filter through the users? http://hastebin.com/roduyetube.xml
[23:45:31] <Cork> Verzlo: if the server is configured correctly data should already be an object so $.parseJSON would fail
[23:46:19] <Cork> Verzlo: a side note, you don't want to append releatedly to the dom in a loop, it causes heavy load and slows down the page a lot
[23:46:47] <Verzlo> Im not, its being loaded once
[23:46:54] <Verzlo> Its being appened on dom load
[23:46:56] <Verzlo> and nowhere else
[23:46:59] <Cork> Verzlo: you use appendTo several times in the $.each loop
[23:47:06] <Cork> and $.each is a loop
[23:47:11] <Verzlo> Ah..
[23:47:14] <Verzlo> I see what you mean now
[23:47:20] <Verzlo> Ill sort that out later
[23:47:22] <Cork> each append causes the page to do a reflow of the page content
[23:47:34] <Cork> and that is the most expensive action you can get the browser to do
[23:47:47] <Cork> you do it like 5 times per iteration
[23:48:21] <Cork> anyway if you want comment on why things break you need to provide more then dead code
[23:48:49] <Verzlo> Thats the minimal code on why the filter isn't working
[23:48:59] <Verzlo> And thats all I am concerned about currently
[23:49:59] <Cork> Verzlo: it's dead code meaning one can't inspect what happens
[23:50:17] <Cork> that makes stating why things break hard
[23:50:40] <Cork> Verzlo: also your php script is broken: Content-Type: text/html
[23:50:45] <Cork> it lies about what content it sends
[23:51:07] <Cork> you need to add a header('Content-Type: application/json') before you echo the response
[23:53:30] <Verzlo> Did a bit of debugging on it with logging, and its all succeeding..
[23:53:40] <Verzlo> Saying its found a row that is indexOf  the entered data
[23:53:45] <Verzlo> But nothing changes
[23:59:39] <Verzlo> Cork: Your changing of the way I append was the solution
