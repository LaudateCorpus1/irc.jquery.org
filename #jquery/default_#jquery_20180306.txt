[00:50:09] <alturic> Hey guys, odd question. Anyone using Google Maps v3 API?
[00:59:14] <Woet> thats indeed an odd question
[00:59:20] <Woet> are you doing a survey?
[01:00:38] <alturic> Kind've. I have an idle listener, which is only supposed to fire once, and it was doing just that until recently. I have a function inside the idle event listener, and the function is just constantly ran in a loop for some reason.

[06:30:32] <Guest6097> hi ihave problem with ajay and jquery
[06:30:39] <Guest6097> https://paste.opensuse.org/74023338
[06:31:35] <Guest6097> if i try to send the form they always use post instead ajax
[06:37:05] <m1su> my guess is that #pwchangeform doesn't exist yet when you try to attach the submint event handler, since you are adding the form dynamically
[06:37:18] <m1su> you'll need to use event delegation
[07:24:15] <Guest6097> m1su: i changed to on method without success https://paste.opensuse.org/70142068
[07:27:32] <Cork> Guest6097: that isn't delegated
[07:28:16] <Cork> Guest6097: also you want the form submit event not click events

[07:59:18] <jordansz> hello everyone, i want to intentionally break jquery from working, is there a way to do this after its loaded?
[07:59:36] <jordansz> change the dom name or something else so jquery gets disabled, even though it it 'loaded' into the html
[08:02:43] <Cork> jordansz: window.$ = window.jquery = function() {}
[08:03:21] <jordansz> thank you Cork
[08:03:25] <jordansz> could not find anything with google
[08:03:36] <Cork> not really something ppl normally try to do
[08:04:11] <Cork> that won't break scripts that has a local reference to the object though
[08:36:07] <nindustries> Hi, my jquery.js is triggering a Content-Security-Policy on my website. Ideas?
[08:36:20] <nindustries> jquery.js:3 Refused to apply inline style because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "style-src 'self'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-M3Xqyp8epS0M8fpW9FXAQu3NaF4sFJ78Qti+FcN1afc='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.
[08:48:23] <Cork> nindustries: you would have to check what code you call
[08:48:46] <Cork> .animate, .css, .hide(), .show() would all be unallowed commands
[08:49:17] <Cork> nindustries: so it isn't jquery causing it, it is cause something you call
[08:49:38] <Cork> (what your csp and the causing line are is needed to tell why)
[08:50:34] <nindustries> I'll look. This is the console: https://i.imgur.com/hJCA56q.png
[08:52:32] <nindustries> hm, I'm not doing a .css
[08:52:44] <nindustries> weird that the browser only shows jquery.js
[08:52:47] <Cork> just check the stacktrace from the exception
[08:52:51] <Cork> no it isn't
[08:52:57] <Cork> you call jquery functions
[08:53:11] <Cork> so jquery will do the unallowed dom command
[08:53:30] <Cork> so the browser will point at jquery not at the line calling jquery
[08:53:45] <Cork> (but just check a few lines further down to find your own code)
[08:55:30] <nindustries> aha2
[08:55:32] <nindustries> flot.js
[09:03:10] <nindustries> $.plot is triggering it, weird
[09:13:53] <nindustries> https://github.com/flot/flot/issues/1574
[09:20:05] <Cork> nindustries: the bug isn't in flot
[09:20:46] <Cork> there are calls in flot you can't use cause again you don't allow inline style changes
[09:25:21] <nindustries> which would those be?
[09:25:49] <Cork> most anything that dynamically try to change the style of things
[09:26:06] <Cork> except style changes based on class changes
[09:26:30] <nindustries> err, so the main reason of flot? :P
[09:26:41] <Cork> basically ya
[09:26:58] <Cork> its like forbidding javascript and then complain jquery doesn't work
[09:27:41] <Cork> one have to be very careful when one goes with higher restrictions in csp
[09:36:54] <nindustries> hm, style: unsafe-inline it is then
[09:43:57] <Cork> nindustries: might be worth knowing, javascript can't modify stylesheets (they can but it is very costly)
[09:44:11] <Cork> nindustries: so when javascript changes the style of an element it is done with inline style
[09:44:19] <nindustries> I see
[09:44:30] <nindustries> oh well, I added unsafe-inline to my CSP. Too bad I guess
[09:44:53] <Cork> nindustries: so if one wants to forbid inline style (witch is definitely possible) one have to carefully design every script interaction to account for it
[09:45:21] <Cork> i have it on one of the sites i develop, but that really means you can't do a lot of things "dynamically"
[09:45:25] <nindustries> Well, I modified my scripts to account for it .. except my chart library
[09:45:29] <nindustries> Indeed
[09:45:36] <Cork> it all have to be defined beforehand
[11:28:01] <jomofcw> Hello !
[11:28:37] <jomofcw> In the success callback of an AJAX using jQuery, is there a way to get the URLs called with GET params, please ?
[11:57:16] <jomofcw> I get it using "this.url", simply...
[11:59:24] <AdamPDotty> Thanks for sharing!
[13:08:44] <robertmaxrees> good morning
