[00:31:00] <igcewieling> I'm trying to disable all input elements except the buttons.  I tried $('#myid :input').not('#myid :button').attr('disabled', false); but it still disabled the buttons.  Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
[00:31:54] <ak> $('#myid :input').not('[type="submit"]').attr('disabled', false);
[00:31:56] <igcewieling> sorry, not disable, enable
[00:32:13] <ak> or $('input').not('[type="submit"]').attr('disabled', false);
[00:32:16] <igcewieling> ak: that will work on <button> elemtns?
[00:32:25] <ak> ah
[00:32:27] <ak> wait
[00:32:34] <ak> so what do you do here?
[00:32:43] <ak> enable the buttons, or disable not buttons?
[00:33:27] <igcewieling> the enabling and disabling of :input elements I have working.  It is the "not buttons" part which does not seem to work
[00:33:40] <ak> well
[00:33:50] <ak> how do you disable the input elements?
[00:34:04] <ak> show me that part
[00:34:46] <igcewieling> $('#phone_add form :input').attr("disabled", true);
[00:35:31] <ak> $('#phone_add form :input').not('button').attr("disabled", true);
[00:35:44] <igcewieling> which is working as I want.
[00:36:05] <ak> $('#phone_add form :input').not('button').attr("disabled", true);       < this way you won't disable the buttons
[00:37:39] <igcewieling> thanks, that is the key.  I should have been using .not('button') instead of .not(':input button')
[00:38:13] <ak> np
[01:20:00] <helllen> helllo
[01:20:11] <helllen> I have sortable portlets elements
[01:20:25] <helllen> I can move the port let correctly
[01:20:55] <helllen> the problem is I would like to move the portlet only if I click on the header
[01:21:07] <helllen> not in the content
[01:24:24] <coldhead> helllen: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#option-handle
[01:24:33] <coldhead> can you use that?
[01:25:35] <helllen> I have a look
[01:26:10] <Guest95170> coldhead how much experience have you in drupal?
[01:26:26] <tw2113> run away coldhead ! run away!
[01:51:09] <helllen> it works
[01:51:18] <helllen> thanks coldhead
[03:12:32] <AmiAsi> where to ask question for jquery?
[03:14:23] <jamesdotnet> type it in that little box
[03:15:29] <AmiAsi> what is the main different between .after and .insertAfter
[03:17:15] <jamesdotnet> newStuff.insertAfter(place)  vs.  place.after(newStuff)
[03:17:57] <jamesdotnet> I don't think there is a behavior difference
[03:18:21] <AmiAsi> @jamesdotnet thanks
[03:50:08] <stefuNz> hey. i'm preventing a page exit using the confirm(…) function (for when a user has unsaved changes) - is there a way to make that dialog a little bit more beautiful ?
[04:02:28] <jamesdotnet> Sure, nonexistent is beautiful :)
[04:03:22] <K3|Chris> stefuNz: stay still while I murder you please
[04:03:43] <K3|Chris> I only close a tab when I'm done with it, prompts asking me if I really want to piss me off
[04:05:35] <jamesdotnet> If it's so important, it should probably already be pushing drafts to the server or a cookie or something
[04:15:21] <xdjuj__> stefuNz you can use the jQuery UI Dialog
[04:15:42] <xdjuj__> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[04:15:54] <xdjuj__> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-confirmation
[04:16:18] <xdjuj__> stefuNz => http://blog.nemikor.com/2009/04/08/basic-usage-of-the-jquery-ui-dialog/
[04:16:31] <stefuNz> xdjuj__: yes. i'm trying to prevent the user to exit the page unless he has confirmed it
[04:17:07] <xdjuj__> If he clicks on the navigator button, you can't do anything as far as I know :)
[04:19:13] <stefuNz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onbeforeunload in combination with confirm()
[04:20:23] <jamesdotnet> xdjuj__: popping up an alert box before window unload will prevent it, but at that point you could just as easily submit the draft by ajax and display it again if they come back, sparing the user the annoyance.
[04:29:14] <thecopy> what should i check if it works in jsfiddle but not on my site? (it says .sortable isn't a function=
[04:36:07] <thecopy> fixed it
[04:44:31] <anandhegde> is there anyway i can click the next and previous button in javascript here - http://engineer.org.in/2011/realtime/ ; or can i do this using a chrome plugin?
[05:39:41] <chomwitt> hi. i simple fadeIn example works in 1.6 but not in latest 1.8.
[05:54:37] <TheFuzzball> I have a bar at the bottom of a web app that will resize depending on the amount of text in the element, I'm doing this resizing through jQuery's animate.
[05:55:15] <TheFuzzball> In all browsers I've tested apart from the latest Safari and Chromium (Chrome works), there is a jutter when resizing the bar and the animation is not smooth
[05:56:27] <TheFuzzball> Chrome has Webkit 535.19 and Safari has Webkit 536.22, so I'm working on the assumption that this bug was introduced somewhere between those versions.
[05:56:54] <K3|Chris> chrome and safari don't use webkit as is
[05:57:00] <K3|Chris> they tweak it
[05:57:16] <K3|Chris> mostly the same but they're not exactly the same
[05:57:21] <TheFuzzball> Hmm
[05:58:00] <TheFuzzball> Mobile Safari is at Webkit 536.26, and does not stutter when doing the animation, so that would support your assertion.
[05:58:40] <TheFuzzball> Has anyone had experience with this issue? Any known workaround?
[06:02:09] <TheFuzzball> Here's what I'm working with - http://jsfiddle.net/LNW6H/
[06:02:40] <TheFuzzball> I'm resizing the height of .cc-model-changer > li and .co-overlay-bottomBar
[06:21:33] <K3|Chris> TheFuzzball: might actually be hardware acceleration problems
[06:22:16] <TheFuzzball> I'm using jquery-animate-enhanced (which is a POS, but I'm locked in now.) and that does hardware acceleration.
[07:12:22] <fkm> Hi there. Shouldn't $('body').append('<div id="jsv_player"></div>') and $('div').attr('src',"jsv_player").appendTo('body') produce the same result?
[07:13:02] <fkm> I'm playing around with the YouTube IFrame API and the latter doesn't work.
[07:13:03] <RandalSchwartz> one has id one has src
[07:13:12] <RandalSchwartz> is that deliberate?
[07:13:27] <fkm> -.-
[07:13:30] <RandalSchwartz> if so, then no, they should not produce the same result
[07:13:35] <fkm> Let me check xD
[07:14:40] <Nitrxgen> .attr('id', 'jsv_player') then yes
[07:14:41] <fkm> No. I doesn't work with 'id' either.
[07:14:56] <Nitrxgen> hum

[07:39:46] <Patabugen> I need a beer

[07:40:39] <Patabugen> An excellent idea
[07:40:56] <rhythem> now can oyu help me ?? :P
[07:40:59] <rhythem> you*
[07:41:09] <Pata[afk]> I have no idea
[07:41:31] <rhythem> great!! carry on with beer
[07:42:28] <Patabugen> (psst, just ask your question)
[07:45:42] <rhythem> i want to run some code in jquery after the document.ready is fired
[07:50:02] <Patabugen> rhythem: $(function(){ // your code here });
[07:51:00] <xdjuj__> jQuery(document).ready(function() {	
[07:51:01] <xdjuj__> 	initMyInitPages = myInitPages();
[07:51:01] <xdjuj__> [… your code …]
[07:51:01] <xdjuj__> }
[07:51:36] <Patabugen> What's the initMyInitPages line for?
[07:52:04] <xdjuj__> You can put this in a <script>jQuery(document blablabla</scrip> or in a file.js called by a <script src="file.js
[07:52:18] <xdjuj__> Patabugen whatever you want
[07:52:35] <xdjuj__> For my, that's the pool of "must have" function
[07:53:00] <Patabugen> Just clarifying so as to not confuse rhythem
[07:53:14] <xdjuj__> http://jquery.pastebin.fr/23925
[07:54:11] <xdjuj__> For rhythem just throw away this line and that's good
[07:54:20] <xdjuj__> Ok he's time out :)
[07:54:22] <xdjuj__> So...
[07:56:12] <xec> xdjuj__: no need to answer an already answered question with a 4line paste of confusing code ;)
[07:59:56] <chomwitt> debugging a simple fadeIn page i saw that 1.8 uses box-sizing which is not supported by firefox 14
[08:13:12] <rhythem> anyone can help me?
[08:13:16] <rhythem> in jquery
[08:16:13] <Patabugen> rhythem: $(function(){ // your code here });
[08:16:38] <Patabugen> rhythem: or $(document).ready(function(){ // your code here });
[08:17:21] <rhythem> bro that dint work
[08:17:49] <Patabugen> You'll need to explain your problem a bit better then
[08:18:00] <Patabugen> preferably make a jsfiddle.net
[08:18:26] <rhythem> wat is jsfiddle???
[08:18:26] <rhythem> net
[08:18:47] <Patabugen> www.jsfiddle.net click it and experience the magic
[08:19:42] <Patabugen> Make up a simple sample of the problem you're having, share the link, and hope someone can help you
[08:21:50] <rhythem> i am trying to make something like facebooks add friend button whic changes text based on whether the user is already frien with me or not or have i already sent the request
[08:22:36] <Patabugen> I'd suggest you make that change when you're generating the HTML
[08:23:23] <rhythem> but i haveto make ajax call to generate the value to be set to the button
[08:23:53] <Patabugen> ok, what's your jQuery question?
[08:24:42] <rhythem> how to do all this via jquery
[08:25:24] <Patabugen> That's a little vague
[08:25:27] <Patabugen> Do you know any jQuery yet?
[08:25:39] <rhythem> yes i know basic..
[08:26:13] <Patabugen> You want .ajax() for the ajax call and something like .html() or .val() for setting the value
[08:27:00] <rhythem> yes i did the same. wait lemme show u the code
[08:28:35] <rhythem> http://pastebin.com/DFJPaakp
[08:31:04] <rhythem> @patabugen there?
[08:31:10] <Patabugen> Ah, the code wont wait for the ajax to finish before moving on to line 11
[08:31:32] <Patabugen> You want to either do that work in the ajax callback, or get the promise returned by $.ajax and work from that
[08:31:42] <rhythem> yes that is my problem it moves to line 11 and does not wait for the $post
[08:32:09] <rhythem> i dint get u properly..
[08:32:09] <RandalSchwartz> that's by design :)
[08:32:24] <RandalSchwartz> have you done much event-driven programming before?
[08:33:15] <rhythem> RandalSchwartz what?
[08:33:41] <rhythem> http://pastebin.com/iZ9ndJuj i tried this but the alert boxes print undefined and nothing else
[08:34:00] <Patabugen> rhythem, you'd do well to read up about "asyncronous" and "Event driven programming"
[08:34:21] <Patabugen> Then you'll understand why it's not working as you think it should be
[08:34:40] <rhythem> hmm okk. i'll do that..
[08:34:48] <rhythem> thanks for the help anyways
[08:34:56] <RandalSchwartz> at the return of .ajax, there are now two logical "threads" in parallel
[08:35:13] <RandalSchwartz> one is waiting for the server, and will call the callback at the end of that
[08:35:29] <RandalSchwartz> the other continues to the statement following the .ajax *immediately*
[08:35:42] <RandalSchwartz> you need to decide when you want to pop the alert... I suspect it'll be in the ajax callback
[08:35:59] <rhythem> hm
[08:36:12] <rhythem> thats something i have litle knowledge of.. i'll read it up first
[08:40:31] <rhythem> @patabugen if i want to check for the text of a span i jquery how would i do that?

[09:01:27] <Christer_> any recommended URL parser? my site displays url's like this.is/my/url
[09:06:08] <ML74> Could someone help me with a hover effect? Need something to highlight/dim each table on hover. It's one image, so need some suggestions :/ http://www.boxnightclub.com/exp/area/vip-tables/
[09:08:37] <Vaerros> ML74: that's going to get needlessly complicated
[09:08:58] <ML74> Vaerros: I've got a map done already, just need something simple to highlight each table
[09:09:57] <Christer_> ML74: Wheres the map then ? Or do you meen that one single image on the website?
[09:10:32] <ML74> Christer_: HTML map. Highligting the area for the tables. Just need something like a filter overlay :/
[09:12:43] <Christer_> well, if its enough, you could try just setting the <area> tag with a background color and an alpha transparancy.
[09:20:42] <bung> ML74: or for each <area> rollover effect with a different image
[09:20:57] <bung> a different /full/ image
[09:21:11] <bung> i mean if you're doing it with one full one to begin with..
[09:22:12] <ML74> I've just found this: http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs/
[09:23:10] <bung> fair enough

[10:17:28] <Norbo11> http://jsfiddle.net/Ruv4h/
[10:17:45] <Norbo11> Items -> Tools should display 2 more sub categories
[10:18:07] <Norbo11> But it isnt being displayed, because im hiding elements on click of a button in my javascript
[10:18:14] <Norbo11> I'm not sure how to solve this
[10:25:06] <ak> Norbo11: there are a lot of problems with this
[10:25:18] <Norbo11> ak: Like?
[10:26:18] <xdjuj__> I'm not sure to understand what you need to do :)
[10:26:54] <xdjuj__> But what I can say is that your HTML is really not accessible :)
[10:27:02] <Norbo11> What do you mean?
[10:27:56] <ak> Norbo11: http://jsfiddle.net/Ruv4h/1/
[10:28:06] <ha6aha6a> hello. i want to be able to show some message for the user when something happens on the serve. for example like when you get a msg on facebook you see a red mark that let's you know that there is a new msg. where can i find info about this?
[10:28:08] <xdjuj__> You've not <ul> open, you use <button> but it's not a <form> you should use <a href=""> and so on :)
[10:28:36] <xdjuj__> Norbo11 you're making a menu in jQuery, a menu must be first in HTML/CSS then in jQuery :)
[10:28:39] <Norbo11> What do you mean im not <ul> open?
[10:29:01] <Norbo11> ak: thank you!
[10:29:28] <xdjuj__> ha6aha6a are you looking for this ? => http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[10:29:57] <ha6aha6a> xdjuj__: thanks i am having a look
[10:30:53] <xdjuj__> Norbo11 you also should not use inline but should trigger your jQuery with CSS class/id
[10:31:05] <ak> ha6aha6a: https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=14218138919  i think you need this...
[10:31:14] <Norbo11> xdjuj__: yeah, im going to do that
[10:34:45] <ha6aha6a> ak i am not talking specifically about facebook. i just used facebook as an example. what i want to achieve that when something happens on a server, for example there is a new entry in table in the dabatase, i want the user to be notified right away
[10:35:01] <ak> ha6aha6a: hat article is about this...
[10:35:24] <ha6aha6a> ak oklet me read
[10:35:44] <ak> "avascript make an HTTP GET request over a persistent connection that doesn't return until the server has data for the client. The request gets reestablished if it's interrupted or times out. This isn't by any means a new technique: it's a variation of Comet, specifically XHR long polling, and/or BOSH."
[10:35:49] <xdjuj__> Norbo11 ==> http://jsfiddle.net/Ruv4h/2/
[10:36:01] <xdjuj__> Something like this is much more W3C compliant and accessible
[10:36:33] <xdjuj__> You also should NOT use "display: none" in your CSS without having a special class added by jQuery
[10:37:11] <Norbo11> okay, thanks for the tipds
[10:37:14] <Norbo11> tips
[10:37:57] <xdjuj__> Norbo11 something like this so
[10:37:58] <xdjuj__> http://jsfiddle.net/Ruv4h/3/
[10:39:16] <xdjuj__> And also, you can't use inline-block with IE7, you must add => zoom: 1;*display:inline; to your CSS it's a hack to have it working with IE7
[10:40:17] <Norbo11> I see
[10:40:38] <Norbo11> How can I make the fadeToggle animation not play if everything is already visible?
[10:40:42] <Norbo11> if (!thisButton.is(":visible")) thisButton.fadeToggle(); isnt working
[10:45:14] <ha6aha6a> ak yes i see now. i think it is this XHR polling that i have to use
[10:46:04] <ak> xhr long polling
[10:46:33] <olinux> so i have an html form that is returned via an ajax request it is displayed in a modal
[10:47:02] <olinux> i need to trigger some javascript to attach the close event to the close button in the modal
[10:47:28] <olinux> but not sure how to exec the js that is returned in the ajax request
[10:47:58] <ha6aha6a> ak yes. COmet programming
[10:48:38] <ak> olinux: you can assign it where you open the modal
[11:19:57] <smykes> anyone tell me why this isn't working properly?
[11:20:18] <ak> hm?
[11:23:30] <smykes> Can I not use namespaces in jsfiddle?
[11:29:15] <smykes> ak?

[11:48:01] <sfreak> Ak: ohh actually i am trying jquery today only
[11:59:05] <sfreak> Ak: its not working. can u point out where i am going wrong?
[12:08:32] <smykes2> ak:  Im getting undefined in my array after all is said and done
[12:08:33] <smykes2> http://pastebin.com/DeQnz3ZG
[12:09:29] <smykes2> and it sees to happen only when it hits line 9
[12:10:41] <ak> smykes2: your array is undefined...
[12:13:30] <sekyms> WTF is up with y connection
[12:13:31] <sekyms> argh
[12:14:05] <sekyms> ak:  did you get that part?  about the return being undefined when it hits line 9
[12:22:05] <sfreak> i am developing spring application. In my application spring controller sending arraylist like [a.sc, b.df, g.hj] to the jsp page. I wanted to display this list on page in table format like | a.sc | sc | . how can i do this? i was trying like this http://pastebin.com/q11BdPg8. please guide me how can i do this
[12:24:47] <Norbo11> Im trying to add an icon to the side of all button elements which are a child of an li element, if that li element has an ul child.
[12:24:49] <Norbo11> How can i do this?
[12:24:49] <Norbo11> http://jsfiddle.net/KxQsu/
[12:25:20] <sekyms> i think I've done that by  appending a span next to them
[12:25:22] <sekyms> iirc
[12:25:25] <Norbo11> Basically I want to the user to know if after clicking the button more options can be shown.
[12:36:01] <sekyms> Ak: http://jsbin.com/welcome/16488/
[12:36:11] <sekyms> why is that returning undefined?
[12:40:50] <masak> sekyms: because for that index, HelperFunctions.calculateYOffset gets to the end of the function without explicitly returning anything.
[12:41:10] <masak> sekyms: falling out of the bottom of a function causes the function to return undefined.
[12:42:50] <bung> Norbo11: http://jsfiddle.net/KxQsu/1/  that what you're looking for?
[12:43:21] <Norbo11> It is, thank you bung!
[12:44:36] <bung> thers probably 20 ways to write that
[12:44:40] <bung> anyway
[12:45:42] <sfreak> how can i change  items=[ cms.html, gnudoc]  to items = ["cms.html", "gnudoc"]?
[12:46:09] <bung> you shouldnt have to
[12:46:30] <bung> well are you trying to do
[12:46:42] <bung> is the first items actual objects, and the second just the names of the objects?
[12:47:44] <sfreak> yeah
[12:49:08] <bung> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5448135/how-to-get-objects-name-in-javascript
[12:49:09] <sfreak> i am trying to display array element in html in list format
[12:49:15] <bung> The "name of an object" is no intrinsic property of an object. A "name" is name in a given context.
[12:50:42] <bung> maybe write in more detail what you want and post it to stackoverflow, i dont understand what you're trying to do
[12:50:52] <bung> show some sample flow or code
[12:54:39] <sfreak> bung: http://jsbin.com/icino3/645/ i am trying this. but this code is not working
[12:55:39] <ak> o.O
[12:56:38] <ak> try 'cms.html', 'gnudoc'
[12:57:20] <sfreak> Ak: but i am getting array in [cms.html, gnudoc] format and i tried that but still its not working
[12:57:41] <ak> cms.html, gnudoc is not valid javascript
[12:57:56] <ak> in the context you are using it
[12:58:45] <ak> sfreak: http://jsbin.com/icino3/647
[12:58:46] <sfreak> in my application controller sending [cms.html, gnudoc] array. so i wanted to convert it into string array
[12:59:12] <ak> but if you want a string, you have to put it into ' or "
[12:59:30] <ak> ['cms.html', 'gnudoc'] ...
[12:59:33] <bung> all he has is existing objects in an array as input
[12:59:47] <bung> he wants print_r essentially
[13:00:25] <ak> maybe i just don't get t..
[13:00:29] <sfreak> Ak: ohh i was trying with ["cms.html", "gnudoc"]
[13:01:00] <bung> i dont get it either
[13:01:39] <sfreak> now i have to convert object array [cms.html, gnudoc] into string array ['cms.html', 'gnudoc']
[13:01:57] <ak> hm
[13:02:00] <bung> does your object array change sfreak ?
[13:02:10] <bung> are you looking for a dynamic solution?
[13:02:23] <sfreak> yeah
[13:02:33] <ak> and does your object array exists in the javascript part too?
[13:02:35] <sfreak> number of elements changes on request
[13:02:36] <bung> search for javascript print_r
[13:02:40] <bung> maybe youll find something
[13:03:33] <sfreak> Ak: i am passing array from java controller to jsp
[13:05:28] <sfreak> so controller is sending something like [cms.html, gnudoc] which i wanted to convert into ['cms.html', 'gnudoc'] string array and then display it
[13:06:30] <ak> you have to fix this in the backend...
[13:06:55] <sfreak> in controller?
[13:07:03] <ak> or in the view
[13:08:10] <sfreak> k
[13:11:11] <bung> sfreak, i think what you need is an object or array like { 'cms.html' : cms.html, 'gnudoc' : gnudoc }
[13:11:20] <bung> then its easier
[13:11:36] <bung> if you have the ability to get that sort of thing, i dont know
[13:12:14] <sfreak> yeah i will try to change on controller side
[13:12:35] <bung> cool, gl
[13:13:06] <bung> you could google for: javascript print_r
[13:13:13] <bung> might get lucky without having to change controller
[13:13:14] <bung> i dunno
[13:13:33] <bung> they probably all want an object like i wrote though
[13:26:00] <ML74> What's wrong with this code? Getting unexpected end of input :/
[13:26:06] <ML74> http://pastebin.com/qvd8cq0H
[13:26:34] <gkatsev> you're missing the } from function and the ) from click
[13:26:57] <ML74> whereabouts? :/
[13:27:25] <gkatsev> last line
[13:27:32] <gkatsev> you aren't closing the parens from the first line
[13:27:56] <ML74> oh, my bad
[13:27:58] <ML74> see it now
[13:28:16] <ML74> there was a }); closing the document.ready
[13:32:54] <ace`> i have a contact form inside of facebox, when i submit the form it loads the params into the URL like site/?bla=bla&bla2=bla2 etc but leaves out the send_contact.php so it doesn't actually do the form action. i kept checking in chrome and it would tell me unexpected tokens so i would change things, this has an unexpected tokens but even when i got it to say no unexpected tokens it didn't transfer
[13:32:54] <ace`> through. any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/zmFek/
[13:33:39] <ML74> How would I get the mouse position on click - relative to the top left of a div?
[13:33:54] <bung> ML74: thats an easy google
[13:34:08] <ML74> bung: I'm using something at the minute, but getting nowhere
[13:34:12] <bung> ace`: did you preventDefault() on the form submission?
[13:34:39] <ace`> no i havent tried that
[13:34:58] <Soothsayer> which selector should I be using to target elements which have a class that starts with the word 'level'
[13:35:16] <Soothsayer> so div.level1, div.level2, div.foo.level3, etc are all valid matches.
[13:35:19] <gnarf> https://twitter.com/gnarf37/status/239823259380625408
[13:35:20] <Gandalf84> Hi
[13:35:33] <ak> ace`: also try http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[13:35:35] <bung> ace`: it sounds like your form is getting submitted, but your javascript makes me thing you're trying to do it with ajax right
[13:35:51] <ace`> yes
[13:36:04] <gnarf> ^^^ Conference videos are online
[13:36:05] <ace`> ok ak thx ill look into it
[13:36:29] <Gandalf84> I'm using "data-prototype" div property, in order to have a prototype. Can I handle the code inside this property with jQuery as HTML?
[13:37:01] <bung> ace`: in the example on that serialize page, i guess you want "...submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault()..."
[13:37:37] <ace`> ok awesome, i'm going to try that, i appreciate it
[13:37:48] <daurnimator> how can I get the url of an ajax request?
[13:37:54] <MZAWeb> Soothsayer: why don't you add a generic class like 'levels' to all of them and target that?
[13:38:08] <daurnimator> (that is; one with get data params passed in)
[13:38:12] <Soothsayer> MZAWeb:  don't have control over the server side markup generated unfortunately.
[13:38:41] <bung> daurnimator: in firebug console?
[13:38:54] <daurnimator> bung: no; in jquery.
[13:39:16] <bung> so programmatically..
[13:39:25] <bung> you know an ajax call is being made but you dont know to where?
[13:39:27] <bung> how is this possible
[13:39:50] <daurnimator> eg, $.get("",{"foo":"bar"},function(d,t,j){ /* here I want http://example.com/something?foo=bar */ })
[13:40:02] <MZAWeb> Soothsayer: oh. I think you need to filter () ie: $('div').filter(function () { return /^level[1-9].*/.test(this.class); }) (not tested)
[13:40:24] <MZAWeb> Soothsayer: there's nothing built in AFAIK
[13:40:39] <Soothsayer> MZAWeb: ok, thanks.. just wanted to confirm that than regret later.
[13:40:42] <daurnimator> bung: I don't want to re-implement jquery's object=>query string convbertor
[13:40:45] <bung> var ajaxTarget = "http://example"; $.get(ajaxTarget, function(d,t,j){ console.log(ajaxTarget);..
[13:41:06] <daurnimator> bung: the important part being the `data` argument
[13:41:36] <bung> console.log(ajaxTarget + data.serialize)
[13:41:39] <bung> ?
[13:41:47] <bung> d.serialize()
[13:42:30] <bung> or is that for forms only
[13:42:32] <bung> i guess
[13:43:21] <daurnimator> yep
[13:43:23] <bung> maybe this http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[13:43:34] <daurnimator> param gets some weird answers
[13:43:44] <bung> =/
[13:44:22] <bung> google gives me nothing but param
[13:44:23] <daurnimator> eg; $.param({"a":["b","c"]}) ==> "a%5B%5D=b&a%5B%5D=c"
[13:45:02] <bung> if you dont want to write a better converter, can you change your data format?
[13:45:13] <Soothsayer> MZAWeb: though if that's the only class the element would have, then I could use the [class^="level"] instead right?
[13:47:16] <Gandalf84> I have a string variable. It contains HTML as text. Can I use this variable as a jQuery object?
[13:47:42] <ak> $(string)
[13:48:04] <MZAWeb> Soothsayer: yes, but not the only. You can have <div class='levels level1'...
[13:48:45] <MZAWeb> Soothsayer: So you can access it by $(".levels") or  $(".level1");
[13:48:47] <Soothsayer> MZAWeb: would that match <div class="foo level1"…" too ?
[13:48:57] <bung> daurnimator: 2nd code example of top rated answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1714786/querystring-encoding-of-a-javascript-object
[13:49:05] <bung> looks like it handles those arrays
[13:51:45] <Gandalf84> ak: Using $(string).children() it says Object…. has no method 'children'
[13:52:45] <Gandalf84> sorry
[13:52:47] <Gandalf84> my mistake :D
[13:52:49] <Gandalf84> it works
[13:55:51] <daurnimator> sorry, back @bung
[13:56:47] <daurnimator> the issue is I need to pass multiple values on the same key
[13:57:20] <daurnimator> ?a=b&a=c
[13:57:24] <daurnimator> I spose I better write it myself

[14:11:16] <devslash> I'm using jquery with the plugins jPlayer and jQueryFileTree. I'm testing on a site on my private lan. whenever i laid my site I see requests from unknown sites that I don't like to like setaga.com and static7.superfish.com
[14:11:41] <devslash> err *load my site
[14:13:17] <quidnunc> What is the syntax for running a selector on a variable whose value is an XML root?
[14:13:46] <devslash> does anyone know why this might be happening
[14:15:38] <quidnunc> nvm, in the faq
[14:16:22] <Gandalf84> I'm using $(mystring).attr('class','newClass')
[14:16:35] <Gandalf84> but in the final mystring, the class doesn't change
[14:31:56] <Gandalf84> http://pastebin.com/84VpKMRv
[14:32:08] <Gandalf84> the alert always display grid-12-12
[14:32:13] <Gandalf84> seems the changes are not saved
[14:57:05] <elgreg> @Gandalf84 Have you tried using .toggleClass?
[14:57:20] <ML74> Is there any problem with these? The ajax doesn't seem to work :/ http://pastebin.com/qQGrJwcz   http://pastebin.com/FhEact2q
[14:58:07] <Gandalf84> elgreg: it perform the changes…but doesn't store in the variable
[14:59:12] <elgreg> @Gandalf84 check .prop instead of .attr after you make the change?
[14:59:57] <Gandalf84> elgreg: it is the same…I'm alerting the all variable…but no changes performed
[15:02:05] <shoky> ML74: what doesn't work? and what's the output of the php?
[15:02:44] <ML74> shoky: output of php is in the other pastebin file. when the box pops up after clicking on one of the tables, there should be content in it.
[15:03:15] <shoky> ML74: that's the code of the php not the output
[15:03:36] <shoky> ML74: and are you getting an alert?
[15:03:57] <shoky> ML74: and what does your devtools network tab say about the request?
[15:03:59] <ML74> shoky: nope
[15:04:04] <ML74> shoky: status 200
[15:04:10] <ML74> so all seems fine, although it's not
[15:04:31] <shoky> no error in console?
[15:04:56] <shoky> and, again, what's the output of the php?
[15:05:19] <shoky> (you can see that in the network tab too)
[15:05:42] <elgreg> Gandalf84: Are you sure? http://jsfiddle.net/elgreg/YpqVN/
[15:05:47] <Bish> hi ;) how can i detect any change on a dom element? .change() seems to be for input stuffs thank you!

[15:06:58] <shoky> ;p
[15:07:05] <ML74> shoky: damn semi colons -_-
[15:07:47] <elgreg> Bish: I think you're talking about DOM mutation events which I don't think are supported very many browsers (see not at bottom of table here) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events#Common.2FW3C_events
[15:08:23] <xec> Gandalf84: what is the myVariable in your pastebin?
[15:08:44] <Bish> elgreg, in detail, i want to write an plguin for chrome, which extracts data from a page, which usese xmlhttprequests to get it's content
[15:10:56] <Bish> changing date int he dome is not a problem, but i don't know when it get's changed by a xmlhttprequest
[15:11:30] <Gandalf84> xec, algreg: http://pastebin.com/KiNw4rpb
[15:11:36] <elgreg> Bish: got it. Well, it very well might be supported in Chrome as in the console you can set breakpoints on DOM change events (right click a node in the dom in the console to see the breakpoint settings). I'm guessing you'd want to listen for an 'DOMSubtreeModified' event.
[15:12:04] <Bish> well, i want to port it to others browsers aswell
[15:12:21] <xec> Gandalf84: that html doesnt look valid to me
[15:12:30] <Gandalf84> I've pasted both HTML and js
[15:12:37] <Bish> there is "clean" way to do it, right?
[15:12:39] <xec> Gandalf84: have you tried validating your markup?
[15:12:43] <shoky> Bish: no
[15:13:08] <shoky> not yet, anyway
[15:13:22] <Gandalf84> ops
[15:13:23] <Gandalf84> sorry
[15:13:26] <Gandalf84> let me paste again
[15:14:55] <Gandalf84> http://pastebin.com/LanSi1yT
[15:15:43] <Bish> shoky, how would you do it, check for change ?
[15:16:15] <sunbeam> does anyone know how come that on textarea this.value doesntr work?
[15:16:32] <elgreg> Gandalf84: that paste looks a little strange, too.
[15:17:07] <xec> Gandalf84: seems to work -- copypasted your code into jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FDgkH/
[15:17:21] <Gandalf84> algreg…I'm using Symfony, a PHP framework, it use this prototype to create new entities in a form
[15:18:51] <xec> Gandalf84: but you are not changing the html string, if thats what you mean, http://jsfiddle.net/FDgkH/1/
[15:19:11] <shoky> Bish: i don't know, i'd need more details about what your plugin is actually doing.. but yeah i'd track changes in whatever elements i'm interested in, i guess
[15:19:13] <Gandalf84> dec, try adding console.log(html); after the each();
[15:19:22] <xec> did you even see the paste
[15:19:26] <sunbeam> does anyone know how come that on textarea this.value doesntr work?
[15:19:35] <Bish> shoky, and how exactly you would recognize a change in the element you're interested in?
[15:19:37] <Gandalf84> xec yes
[15:19:53] <xec> then you will see a console.log(html) after the each....
[15:20:05] <shoky> Bish: check its attributes, its children nodes, etc..
[15:20:13] <Gandalf84> dec, yes I see
[15:20:26] <Gandalf84> xec: all classes are not changed
[15:20:40] <Bish> shoky, okay, thank you
[15:21:21] <xec> correct. you are not changing the string. if thats what you want you can either use string manipulation instead of dom methods, or you can attach the html string to the dom first, and extract after
[15:22:05] <elgreg> Gandalf84: I think once you have the HTML parsed by jQuery into that variable, you're no longer changing the values of data-prototype - you're changing the parsed HTML.
[15:22:18] <elgreg> ... what xec said. :)
[15:23:09] <Gandalf84> xec: how can I attach to dom and than extract?
[15:23:56] <xec> Gandalf84: isnt it easier to do string replace? http://jsfiddle.net/FDgkH/2/
[15:24:42] <Gandalf84> xec: the tricky part is when I need to do this: $(html).find('input[type=button]').parent().attr('class','grid-1-12')
[15:25:29] <xec> Gandalf84: i see. in that case you can just make a temporary element, stick your html in there, do your thing and grab it with .html() after
[15:26:17] <Gandalf84> and how I know that to replace?
[15:26:21] <Gandalf84> have u some code?
[15:27:36] <xec> what?
[15:27:58] <xec> if i know what you know what to replace?
[15:28:08] * xec is confused
[15:29:49] <bung> sunbeam: try .text instead of .value
[15:30:04] <Gandalf84> no I mean...
[15:30:25] <Gandalf84> I can use DOM to replace the class for $(html).find('input[type=button]').parent()
[15:30:42] <Gandalf84> that I put the result in a variable…. and than how replace this in the original string?
[15:30:49] <xec> Gandalf84: your html sample doesnt contain an input button
[15:31:47] <Gandalf84> sorry...ghghghghghh
[15:31:48] <Gandalf84> sorry…ghghghghghh$(html).find('input[type=file]').parent()
[15:31:49] <Gandalf84> $(html).find('input[type=file]').parent()
[15:32:39] <xec> Gandalf84: you're not making much sense, but maybe you can work with this: http://jsfiddle.net/FDgkH/3/
[15:33:03] <artichoke> I'm trying to do a slideUp(), remove(), insert back into the DOM, slideDown() for a form.  Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/LNUkn/ But it looks like once remove() is called, the block of code stops executing and the removed item is gone for good.  Any clues on how to get this working?
[15:39:09] <Gandalf84> dec thank u very much!
[15:39:28] <xec> you're welcome, Candalf84 :)
[15:42:29] <ordinaryman09> anyone know how to make sliding navigation bar?
[15:52:48] <elgreg> artichoke: have you tried detach? Also, what is "temp"? Another dom element in an outside scope?
[15:53:40] <artichoke> elgreg: oops, temp = $('form#edit')
[15:54:46] <elgreg> artichoke: wouldn't that be the same as $(this) once you're inside the slideUp callback?
[15:55:39] <elgreg> artichoke: maybe add the html to the jsfiddle to make this less confusing. Is this something like, I submit the form, then it slides up and slides back down? Does something about it change inbetween?
[15:57:46] <artichoke> elgreg: What I'm trying to achieve is displaying an edit form whenever a user clicks on a row of data.  For example: user clicks on one row and it slides down the form.  If the user decides to click on another row before editing the opened form, it should slide the form up, remove it, and slide down under the clicked row.
[15:58:53] <artichoke> elgreg: http://jsfiddle.net/LNUkn/1/ here's the full call if that helps.
[15:59:36] <daurnimator> is there a reason you shouldn't defer your jquery loading?
[16:03:45] <elgreg> artichoke: .remove() will remove all data and events from the element
[16:03:51] <elgreg> you might want to use .detach()
[16:07:24] <elgreg> artichoke:  http://jsfiddle.net/elgreg/3cJ2a/
[16:08:09] <elgreg> artichoke: Careful with $(this). In the callback to slideup, it was referring to the form itself, rather than the row. You need to assign a variable in the outer scope (see the row var that I created)
[16:09:38] <artichoke> elgreg: Ahh thanks, was about to send an updated fiddle with HTML.  Let me give it a try.
[16:12:02] <artichoke> elgreg: Got it working, thanks! So it looks like $(this) doesn't always refer to the outmost scope.
[16:13:33] <elgreg> artichoke: correct. this will be the current context and $(this) will just try to make it a jquery element. In your anonymous function passed as a callback to a slideup on an element, this is the element that's sliding up.
[16:14:50] <artichoke> elgreg: Gotcha, thanks again!
[16:15:05] <elgreg> no problem
[17:01:23] <oojacoboo> I have a binding issue that I can't quite pinpoint.  For some reason, when binding to an element that's loaded in on page load, then having events bound to it, they aren't firing
[17:01:39] <oojacoboo> but if I move it up the DOM the events bind and fire
[17:01:57] <oojacoboo> anyone have any ideas as to what I might look out for, tips on debugging, etc?
[17:02:58] <coldhead> what do you mean "move it up"
[17:03:08] <oojacoboo> higher up in the tree
[17:03:11] <oojacoboo> DOM tree
[17:04:34] <Guest95170> how do I open port 22
[17:04:42] <oojacoboo> Guest95170, wrong channel
[17:04:52] <coldhead> so possibly a problem with your selector(s), oojacoboo?
[17:05:00] <oojacoboo> coldhead, no
[17:05:08] <Guest95170> oojacoboo: nooo
[17:05:11] <coldhead> Guest95170: cram a screwdriver in it and wiggle it back and forth
[17:05:13] <oojacoboo> I've checked them
[17:06:34] <oojacoboo> coldhead, the problem when where I'm having to set them is that the bindings will persist beyond the current page, being an ajax ui
[17:06:55] <oojacoboo> I need to bind them to an element that's destroyed as to prevent having to unbind them later
[17:09:09] <coldhead> this  sounds way out of my depth, oojacoboo, but do you have a demo for someone smarter than me?
[17:09:21] <coldhead> because as i always say, it's working fine in my imagination
[17:09:29] <oojacoboo> mmm
[17:09:40] <oojacoboo> I don't really have a well accessible demo
[17:09:50] <oojacoboo> but I can of course setup one
[17:10:17] <oojacoboo> coldhead, can I view the bindings within Chrome's inspector on the element's parameter list or anything?
[17:10:46] <coldhead> i'm not sure how that works in this day and age, oojacoboo
[17:11:09] <imsky> ksgdbnsbsfklsnsf
[17:11:13] <oojacoboo> ^^
[17:11:53] <imsky> thanks for understanding
[17:12:27] <oojacoboo> imsky, how do I view the bindings on elements?
[17:12:38] <imsky> bindings?
[17:12:39] <oojacoboo> can that be done within the inspector?
[17:12:43] <imsky> like events?
[17:12:45] <coldhead> gnarf: is there a way to inspect the handlers bound to an element?
[17:12:49] <oojacoboo> yes, bound events
[17:12:56] <imsky> yeah there's a thing for firefox
[17:13:00] <oojacoboo> Chrome?
[17:13:04] <imsky> possibly
[17:13:12] <oojacoboo> any ideas on where to look?
[17:13:40] <imsky> oojacoboo, http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[17:14:21] <oojacoboo> most awewsome
[17:14:23] <oojacoboo> thanks
[17:14:25] <imsky> yw
[17:19:23] <oojacoboo> ugh, doesn't seem to be working :(
[17:19:57] <imsky> oh i forgot
[17:20:03] <imsky> you need to give me 200 bucks
[17:20:12] <oojacoboo> oh… that explains it
[17:20:43] <oojacoboo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7338193/using-chrome-how-to-find-whos-binded-to-an-event
[17:21:01] <imsky> that's pretty nice
[17:21:06] <imsky> use that
[17:24:05] <oojacoboo> yea, isn't really showing anything
[17:24:18] <imsky> maybe your code's broken
[17:24:40] <oojacoboo> it's working when I bind to an event higher up in the DOM
[17:24:49] <imsky> how do you bind it
[17:24:53] <oojacoboo> but not where I need to be binding it so it's destroyed
[17:25:02] <oojacoboo> .on("click"...
[17:25:15] <imsky> visual event specifically works with jquery..so you should see stuff there
[17:25:32] <oojacoboo> it's not firing anything on my app
[17:26:14] <imsky> in that case, try eventbug
[17:26:37] <oojacoboo> ugh
[17:27:47] <oojacoboo> http://code.google.com/p/fbug/source/browse/eventbug/branches/eventbug0.1/chrome/content/eventbug.js?r=9767
[17:27:51] <oojacoboo> strange that's in Chrome
[17:28:00] <imsky> wut
[17:28:00] <b-ot> Detect of current browser like server's method
[17:28:10] <oojacoboo> eventbug/chrome/content
[17:28:11] <imsky> eventbug is 1.5, i'm using it now
[17:28:19] <imsky> yeah...chrome means the firefox chrome
[17:28:25] <oojacoboo> ?
[17:28:28] <imsky> lol
[17:28:34] <oojacoboo> ff is gecko :/
[17:28:39] <imsky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Chrome
[17:28:50] <oojacoboo> FML
[17:29:10] <oojacoboo> of course, why not
[17:29:19] <imsky> this was a huge deal when chrome came out in 08
[17:29:26] <imsky> firefox devs were pissed about the name clash
[17:29:29] <oojacoboo> somehow I missed that fiasco
[17:31:21] <imsky> well install eventbug and try again
[17:31:33] <oojacoboo> yea, upgrading ff and will give that a go
[17:39:31] <oojacoboo> zomg wtf
[17:39:49] <oojacoboo> so you click on the "Events" then "click" events and it shows all of them for the whole DOM?
[17:39:55] <imsky> yeah
[17:39:59] <oojacoboo> it's also not showing one that DOES work
[17:40:06] <imsky> it probably is showing it
[17:40:14] <oojacoboo> the id isn't there
[17:40:42] <oojacoboo> does it show the element it's bound to?
[17:40:45] <oojacoboo> I'm assuming so
[17:41:02] <imsky> sure does
[17:41:24] <oojacoboo> ok, yea, I see that then, for the one that works, and NOT the one that doesn't work that I'm trying to bind to
[17:42:22] <oojacoboo> it doesn't really tell you much about the events though
[17:42:37] <imsky> well buddy
[17:42:39] <oojacoboo> clicking it just takes you to the DOM element
[17:42:46] <imsky> mm no
[17:42:51] <imsky> you can click on the row
[17:43:22] <oojacoboo> right, which highlights it?
[17:43:41] <oojacoboo> oh wait
[17:43:46] <oojacoboo> I see the targets now
[17:44:11] <oojacoboo> but that of course doesn't tell me anything either
[17:50:15] <oojacoboo> imsky, I think I figured out the issue
[17:50:21] <oojacoboo> thanks for the assistance
[17:50:26] <imsky> np hope you get it fixed
[17:51:14] <abstrusenick> anyone knows a jquery plugin for drag and sort that supports mobile devices?
[17:55:23] <BaconJuice> hey guys ran into a little trouble, can someone help me out please?
[17:55:34] <coldhead> you'll have to be more specific
[17:55:36] <oojacoboo> BaconJuice, might wanna call the bail bondsman
[17:55:41] <BaconJuice> its regarding query autocomplete coldhead
[17:55:55] <BaconJuice> oojacoboo haha thank god its not that much of a trouble :P
[17:55:58] <coldhead> oh that stuff is tricky
[17:56:01] <BaconJuice> http://jsfiddle.net/NS439/
[17:56:06] <BaconJuice> coldhead it is :(
[17:56:20] <BaconJuice> so I tried making it as clear as possible on the fiddle
[17:56:38] <BaconJuice> I have my php script returning the json object and the autocomplete is reading it and displaying the options
[17:56:55] <BaconJuice> and when I get the value from the #Applicaiton ID it does pass the name of the app
[17:57:13] <oojacoboo> where is the radio?
[17:57:20] <BaconJuice> however..I would like to implement the App_ID into the rel attribute
[17:57:35] <oojacoboo> input:radio?
[17:57:40] <BaconJuice> oojacoboo oh just ignore that that has nothing to do with the specific code
[17:57:46] <oojacoboo> input[type=radio]
[17:57:54] <BaconJuice> its just show a different autocomplete on radio click
[17:58:05] <oojacoboo> I'm not sure what does have to do with this
[17:58:21] <oojacoboo> I see that function and two vars?
[17:58:42] <oojacoboo> or change event/function rather
[17:58:59] <BaconJuice> oojacoboo ignore the radio button condition on the top I forgot to remove it from this code sample
[17:59:14] <BaconJuice> thats not where the issue I am having is occurring :P
[17:59:47] <oojacoboo> where is it occuring?
[17:59:52] <BaconJuice> I just want to know how to pass "app_ID" into the rel attribute
[17:59:52] <oojacoboo> I don't see any other code
[18:00:23] <oojacoboo> BaconJuice, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[18:00:25] <oojacoboo> you read that?
[18:01:02] <oojacoboo> or you could use this if you have it in the DOM
[18:01:02] <oojacoboo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[18:01:11] <oojacoboo> then just access your object
[18:01:33] <BaconJuice> right but the problem is autocomplete only takes an array of string
[18:01:33] <BaconJuice> it
[18:01:42] <oojacoboo> ?
[18:01:43] <BaconJuice> it creates the list on its own
[18:01:57] <oojacoboo> then create the array and pass it on?
[18:02:11] <BaconJuice> so even if I push a list like items.push('<li id="' + key + '">' + val + '</li>'); it won't right?
[18:02:27] <oojacoboo> I don't use "autocomplete" if this is a plugin
[18:02:30] <oojacoboo> we rolled out own
[18:02:50] <oojacoboo> so I don't know the requirements for whatever this is, but the solution would be to convert the data to the format you need
[18:02:54] <BaconJuice> autocomplete jqueryUI?
[18:03:00] <oojacoboo> ?
[18:03:05] <oojacoboo> I don't know
[18:03:10] <BaconJuice> thats the plugin I'm using
[18:03:15] <oojacoboo> ok
[18:22:54] <rawfodog_> I was wondering if someone could look at this code and tell me if anything looks wrong. I am trying to implement a jQuery date picker into my site. I know very little about jQuery and I feel that my issue might be something rudimentary. Here is the code http://pastebin.com/RphJKAZQ
[18:25:43] <w00tner> hallo mates
[18:27:19] <ngharo> rawfodog_: have you glanced at your browsers javascript console for starters?
[18:27:30] <rawfodog_> no
[18:27:40] <rawfodog_> The code is all linked though
[18:27:42] <ngharo> hit F12
[18:27:46] <rawfodog_> (view source)
[18:27:47] <rawfodog_> k
[18:27:50] <ngharo> look at the console, see if it spat out any errors
[18:28:09] <ngharo> oh i see your problem HEHE
[18:28:22] <ngharo> let me know when you see the error in the console
[18:28:40] <rawfodog_> f12 doesnt work in firefox for me. I have firebug if that helps
[18:29:27] <ngharo> oh, welp open it :)
[18:29:54] <rawfodog_> "[21:27:55.044] missing ) after argument list @ http://www.foo.com/add/:20"
[18:30:24] <ngharo> there ya go.  you need to close the .ready( ... )
[18:30:28] <ngharo> missing closing parenth
[18:48:35] <clipclick> can anyone help me with a short bit of beginner code? http://fpaste.org/OTUn/ << i dont know why this is not triggering.
[18:49:15] <shoky> clipclick: don't you mean $('input[name=username]').blur(...  ?
[18:49:47] <clipclick> oh, i guess.... i've jsut started learning js yesterday :)
[18:49:51] <clipclick> ill give it a try
[18:49:58] <shoky> the input is blurred, not the form..
[18:50:06] <clipclick> ah that would make sense
[18:50:07] <clipclick> thanks
[19:01:41] <shoky> hey gnarf, if you're curious about the css-transform issue i asked about yesterday, i got an interesting and seemingly correct response: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12126254/chrome-css-transform-issue-element-in-front-of-rotated-element-doesnt-respond
[19:02:58] <gnarf> shoky: interesting...
[19:05:51] <shoky> weird stuff
[19:27:54] <coldhead> nosebleeds
[19:28:04] <Eviltwin> blednoses
[19:45:19] <rawfodog_> ngharo, it totally works now thanks  :D
[20:02:58] <neohunter> Hello, I'm trying to use ajaxSubmit() on the click event, but it always sends the form in normal way, i have event.preventDefault(); and event.stopImmediatePropagation, what can be...? any ideas? please i have like 5 hours on this
[20:03:56] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ neohunter
[20:03:57] <bot-t> neohunter, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[20:05:04] <bung> neohunter: $('#myform').submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); alert('stopped'); });
[20:05:07] <bung> that doesnt work for you?
[20:05:24] <bung> change #myform do your form and see
[20:05:28] <neohunter> bung: yeah, it print the alert but after that it sends the form.
[20:05:49] <oojacoboo> neohunter, sounds like the event isn't being bound to the element
[20:05:50] <bung> youll have to paste the code like you were told
[20:05:54] <oojacoboo> is the form ajax loaded in?\
[20:06:17] <neohunter> but the alert is showed, i see the alert so the event is binded to the form.
[20:06:29] <neohunter> im using $form.submit();
[20:06:43] <neohunter> that trigger my event where i have e.preventDefault() and alert("test")
[20:06:49] <coldhead> bound*
[20:07:04] <neohunter> i see the dialog box with "text", click on accept and the form is sent in the normal way
[20:07:05] <bung> neohunter: jsfiddle.net paste it
[20:07:19] <neohunter> yes im doing it on jsfiddle, thanks
[20:38:11] <neohunter> found the error
[20:38:27] <neohunter> on validator submitHandler i have this
[20:38:28] <neohunter> $(this).data('submit') ? $(this).data('submit')() : form.submit();
[20:38:48] <neohunter> how i can set data 'submit' ??? $(this) is $.validator, not the form
[20:39:13] <oojacoboo> why are you setting data("submit") ?
[20:40:21] <neohunter> oojacoboo well is not me, is a library im using.. i dont like that neither... but the library have that, and form is the DOM element so it skip my events...
[20:40:36] <neohunter> i guess the library is expecting me to set data('submit')
[20:40:50] <neohunter> and im not sure if is good idae to change that, maybe can break something
[20:41:05] <oojacoboo> I don't really know what you're talking about
[21:07:20] <lolipali> hello, i have a problem whit animate of jquery, any help please http://jsfiddle.net/ZBUNn/
[21:09:33] <ejcweb_> I've got a click handler attached to $('body'). Subsequenly on the page, I attach a click handler to a specific element. Which is meant to trigger first?
[21:10:32] <coldhead> depends how you bind them
[21:10:40] <coldhead> but it should usually be the specific element one
[21:12:00] <ejcweb_> coldhead: Ok. Currently in my setup I use $('body').click to attach the first handler, but the one for the specific element is assigned using Backbone Events (which I presume must use the .on method for binding, which is equivalent I think?).
[21:12:26] <lolipali> why this work fine in firefox and dont work ni chrome ? http://jsfiddle.net/ZBUNn/3/
[21:12:41] <ejcweb_> coldhead: I really want to be able to achieve a global click handler for the whole site which receives the click event first before anything else.
[21:15:29] <shoky> lolipali: what doesn't work?
[21:18:24] <lolipali> the animate function in chrome add some type of padding
[21:18:43] <lolipali> but in firefox dont
[21:19:06] <lolipali> i dont know why
[21:21:51] <shoky> hmm? looks the same to me
[21:23:51] <coldhead> ejcweb_: you can just bind everything to $('body') and test what was actually clicked by testing e.target
[21:27:44] <coldhead> bye schnoodles, i will never forget you
[22:04:18] <ejcweb_> coldhead: You're suggesting that all other events should be bound to body, such that my first, 'global' click handler fires first>?
[22:07:08] <coldhead> no, i am suggesting just having one event handler
[22:07:14] <coldhead> a super duper handler
[22:07:18] <coldhead> that does everything
[22:07:41] <coldhead> it's probably not a serious suggestion
[22:20:44] <ejcweb_> coldhead: Do you think I could modify the on function to add some logic? I'm having difficulty trying to wrap to existing method successfully though.
[22:24:39] <coldhead> ejcweb_: can you show us the code?
[22:30:35] <ejcweb_> coldhead: I've actually managed to wrap it successfully now. The tricky bit is now to insert the custom logic into the callback passed to on().
[22:32:57] <Helixgruven> Can I select a subset of matched selectors? Similar to the way .eq() does but instead of one element, I want to match the first five, or 5 starting from the 3rd position.
[22:33:12] <coldhead> ?filter @ Helixgruven
[22:33:12] <bot-t> Helixgruven, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[22:33:26] <coldhead> .filter(':lt(5)')
[22:33:32] <Helixgruven> Ah, thank you kindly!
[22:36:34] <Eviltwin> Uh, .slice?
[22:37:04] <devslash> i have a weird problem with my code. I have a breakpoint on this line in firebug in FF: if ( $('#jquery_jplayer_1').data('jPlayer').status.currentTime == '0' && isAddingAllTracks == false ) I put $('#jquery_jplayer_1').data('jPlayer').status.currentTime  into console and it returns 0. I get the value of isAddingAllTracks=true so why is it that the condition evaluates to true and executes when it shouldn't. am i missing something ?
[22:37:32] <amccloud> Anyone got any tricks for prepending items to a div while maintaing scroll position?
[22:38:39] <MZAWeb> amccloud: You can use scrollTo (http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/) to your desired el after each prepend, maybe?
[22:39:15] <amccloud> MZAWeb: that's what I'm currently doing but it doesn't seem to be very accurate
[22:39:22] <amccloud> well
[22:39:27] <amccloud> i'm using scrollTop
[22:39:47] <amccloud> $container.scrollTop($el.outerHeight());
[22:40:10] <MZAWeb> what do you mean by "not very accurate"
[22:42:05] <amccloud> MZAWeb: sometimes it shifts ever so slightly +-20 pixels
[22:43:00] <coldhead> what's 20 pixel between friends
[22:44:47] <MZAWeb> yeah, I hate scrollTo. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I find it inconsistent between browsers
[22:48:10] <Eviltwin> amccloud: http://jsfiddle.net/Y2w4F/
[22:49:55] <amccloud> Eviltwin: sweet!
[22:49:57] <MZAWeb> Eviltwin: that's really cool
[22:51:04] <coldhead> +1
[22:51:36] <tw2113> coldhead, did you just +1 me?
[22:51:37] <tw2113> :D
[22:53:10] <coldhead> er um
[22:53:13] <coldhead> sure, why not
[22:55:19] <tw2113> :D
[23:04:16] <ejcweb_> I've got a jQuery selector (eg. $('.start-button')). In the click event handler of an aribtrary element on the page, how can I check if the target element is matched by the selector?
[23:04:43] <Eviltwin> $(e.target).is('.start-button')
[23:04:47] <Eviltwin> But you may want to see ?on
[23:04:47] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:04:47] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised “on()”.
[23:04:48] <bot-t> b-ot, Couldn't find "memorised “on()”." in jQuery Docs.
[23:05:00] <Eviltwin> And look at the event delgatio nstuff
[23:05:06] <Eviltwin> delegation stuff*
[23:05:38] <Eviltwin> Why does that keep happenign?
[23:06:23] <ejcweb_> Eviltwin: Ok. But can I use the .is() method with the actual jQuery selector? Say all I've got is els = $('.start-button'). Does .is(els) work?
[23:06:42] <Eviltwin> ejcweb_: You should see ?is
[23:06:42] <bot-t> ejcweb_, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[23:14:37] <astropirate> Anyone recommend a wysiwyg editor?
[23:14:52] <Eviltwin> jWYSIWYG
[23:20:53] <hye> anyone recommend a plugin to show bigger images on mousehover.  The problem I have is most that I find aren't smart enough with the hover image positioning, when there is no space on the bottom, its not smart enough to show the image at the top.
