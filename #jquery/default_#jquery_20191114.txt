[07:13:42] <Rockwood> hi everyone
[07:13:58] <Rockwood> how to use jQuery Migrate?
[07:14:56] <Rockwood> any active?>
[07:19:19] <Cork> you load it and when you run the normal page it shows you errors and warnings in the console
[07:19:31] <Cork> (and this is irc, don't expect ppl to answer directly)
[07:20:18] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate#usage
[07:23:44] <Rockwood> need to both libs links or just enough of higher version added
[07:23:50] <Rockwood> i means
[07:27:22] <Rockwood> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/XhZ4HqW5Jw/
[07:40:40] <Cork> Rockwood: you add the version you migrate up to, and a migration lib to make it compatible with the older version you want to move from
[07:40:57] <Cork> what migrate lib you want is in the readme i linked to
[11:36:21] <SylvanCyborg> should $(document).on('click', '.class', ... be defined within a dom ready block, or is it ok to be outside? i think it can be outside, but would there be a reason to have it inside dom ready?
[11:41:42] <shoky> SylvanCyborg: no reason, because it is not immediately trying to access anything in the DOM (except document which exists before DOM-ready event anyway)
[11:42:30] <SylvanCyborg> thanks :)
[11:42:30] <shoky> SylvanCyborg: also if you just put your <script> at the end of <body> then you don't need DOM-ready for anything
[13:04:47] <dimi1947> what are the possible options for ajax prefilter https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/#jQuery-ajaxPrefilter-dataTypes-handler?
[13:05:21] <robertmaxrees> you mean for dataTypes?
[13:06:19] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947
[13:06:35] <dimi1947> give me a second
[13:07:05] <dimi1947> options like this one: options.async = true;...that's one
[13:07:24] <robertmaxrees> can you show me where you're seeing that?
[13:08:23] <dimi1947> give me a minute
[13:10:15] <robertmaxrees> aaahhh you mean https://i.imgur.com/j1UPf6m.png
[13:10:18] <robertmaxrees> stuff like these.
[13:10:37] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/oazx54e3/...yes
[13:10:42] <robertmaxrees> they all listed on https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:10:48] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jQuery-ajax-settings this dude
[13:12:31] <dimi1947> so all these there are the possible options we can use in ajaxprefilter...correct?
[13:13:05] <robertmaxrees> should be - for the options argument that gets passed in to the handler.
[13:13:26] <dimi1947> got it...
[13:14:56] <robertmaxrees> gotta ask tho - why are you using prefilter?
[13:53:05] <dimi1947> are you still there robertmaxrees
[13:53:16] <robertmaxrees> yes.  no need to ask if anybody is around though.
[13:53:20] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question to the channel.
[13:53:27] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will :)
[13:53:42] <dimi1947> No...I want to asnwer the question you made...
[13:53:52] <robertmaxrees> then just answer it :)
[13:56:15] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24639335/javascript-console-log-causes-error-synchronous-xmlhttprequest-on-the-main-thr
[13:56:38] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:56:42] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[13:56:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:57:24] <dimi1947> ok...I will try to explain
[14:02:06] <robertmaxrees> :/ nevermind
[14:02:20] <dimi1947> I am using $.get to bring a page inside another page...both pages have script tags...it seems that the script tags contained in the HTML I am bringing with HTML is causing a deprecation warning in the console
[14:02:29] <robertmaxrees> :|
[14:02:31] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[14:02:38] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing that in the first place?
[14:02:56] <dimi1947> doing what?
[14:03:03] <robertmaxrees> pulling one page into another
[14:04:53] <dimi1947> I just want to avoid reloading a whole page in the DOM...I want some content to be there anyway...and then the rest being brought with ajax...what is wrong with that?
[14:05:22] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad way to do that.
[14:05:39] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't have script tags in the source of the page you're bringing in.
[14:06:59] <dimi1947> I tried removing the script tags...but some code depends on them...
[14:07:07] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to refactor things.
[14:07:40] <robertmaxrees> are you at least just grabbing the contents of the body on the page you're fetching?
[14:07:53] <robertmaxrees> or are you just grabbing the thing wholesale and slapping it in?
[14:08:16] <dimi1947> can you explain me the difference?
[14:08:40] <dimi1947> what are you tryng to say?
[14:08:44] <robertmaxrees> in one case, you're grabbing the entire page.  in the other, you're just grabbing the contents of the body tag.
[14:08:48] <robertmaxrees> i mean exactly that ^
[14:10:27] <dimi1947> yes...I understand
[14:11:54] <dimi1947> give me a minute I want to check your claim..to see what is exactly happening
[14:16:13] <dimi1947> It seems the whole page is being brought in...and the weird thing is that no body tag is shown anywhere
[14:16:18] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:16:28] <robertmaxrees> is there a head tag?
[14:18:25] <dimi1947> the head tag is missing too...I AM TALKING ALWAYS ABOUT THE PAGE THAT IS "BROUGHT IN" WITH get
[14:18:32] <robertmaxrees> woah there
[14:20:07] <dimi1947> why your reation is the aforementioned....obviously you noticed something
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> the all caps.
[14:20:14] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:21:24] <dimi1947> just to be specific about what I am talking to
[14:21:37] <robertmaxrees> all caps usually means you're yelling.
[14:21:38] <robertmaxrees> fyi
[14:39:09] <taplar> if you're pulling back an entire webpage with an ajax request into a jQuery object, jQuery has been known to "eat" tags when it tries to compile the entire page source
[14:39:24] <taplar> in my experience
[14:39:42] <robertmaxrees> the including of script tags is still gonna be a pain tho
[14:39:45] <robertmaxrees> *inclusion
