[01:13:36] <Cork> MagnusVortex: no, and you don't normally, as long as the server doesn't lie about what content it is sending (as long as it sets the correct content-type: application/json header)
[01:14:11] <Cork> MagnusVortex: many site developers doesn't bother to set the header in there php script, causing the server to lie and say it sends text/html
[03:44:06] <RandomNoob> Hello guys. I am using Bootstrap. I have form-group with input field and 2 buttons. I need to some how get input value from corresponding input. Is there clean way?
[03:44:30] <Cork> RandomNoob: depends on the dom relation between the input fields
[03:45:33] <RandomNoob> Cork: If ill show my code can you advice me the right way to do that?
[03:45:45] <Cork> sure => jsfiddle.net
[03:47:14] <RandomNoob> Cork: Ok Ill put it there
[03:49:41] <RandomNoob> Cork: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QpjeaN
[03:50:23] <RandomNoob> Cork: I am going to do that really bad way. Catch button click event check the id of button then depending on it catch input id value and post it with ajax :/
[03:51:04] <Cork> so what elements are you looking for?
[03:51:14] <Cork> the set/read?
[03:51:28] <Cork> or what exactly
[04:12:06] <sigdk> Hello. Any hint on 1) Why that consol.log() is not executed? 2) How exactly do I create and place on the page the DOM elements?  https://jsfiddle.net/d1d5n6qx/15/
[04:12:55] <sigdk> The idea is to select a language, fetch from the backned all the related Q-A and then populate dynamically on the page
[04:13:51] <Cork> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/d1d5n6qx/16/
[04:13:57] <Cork> the id doesn't exist
[04:14:49] <sigdk> Cork, <select id="FAQLanguageSelector">  isn't this?
[04:14:51] <Cork> ah, yap, you're running in head
[04:14:58] <Cork> so body is empty
[04:15:07] <Cork> you need to use $(function() {})
[04:15:13] <sigdk> ah, okay
[04:15:58] <Cork> what throw me off a little was that jsfiddle runs in body by default
[04:16:04] <Cork> and in those cases this isn't a problem
[04:16:47] <sigdk> Cork, thank you
[04:17:02] <sigdk> Cork, how about the 2)?  Actually I'm interested in that more
[04:17:32] <Cork> i don't get the second question
[04:18:12] <sigdk> Cork, I fetch Q-A records from the backend. They all carry a "category" field. I want to group them and populate them (dynamically)
[04:18:16] <Cork> you get html from the server and want to inject that? or you get an array of objects or something?
[04:18:32] <Cork> populate them where?
[04:18:52] <sigdk> Cork, I get an array. A json. I want to display the contents
[04:19:08] <Cork> how much structure are you going to need to create?
[04:20:23] <sigdk> Cork, I don't get the question. The structure is the one I already have there... but this is static. HTML written by hand. I want this HTML (besides the selector) to be generated upon language select
[04:21:54] <Cork> sigdk: so you are going to have to generate everything in the html section for every category entry?
[04:22:12] <Cork> THAT is what i'm asking, what structure will have to be created for each entry
[04:22:22] <sigdk> Cork, yes exactly
[04:22:30] <Cork> O_o
[04:22:33] <sigdk> even the category title has to be generated
[04:22:36] <sigdk> is that possible?
[04:22:43] <sigdk> at least this is what I was thinking...
[04:22:46] <sigdk> would be nice...
[04:22:57] <Cork> so your going to have a set category to "Physics" a language selector and so on for each category?
[04:23:05] <Cork> really?
[04:24:19] <sigdk> 1 Language selector.  Each Q-A has an attribute "category".  I want a section Physics to be generated as long as there are Q-A s for such a category
[04:25:01] <Cork> ...
[04:25:07] <sigdk> Cork, the records are shown how they look more or less below
[04:25:13] <sigdk> Cork, is bad thought?
[04:25:19] <Cork> so again, what part of the structure needs to be generated for each entry
[04:25:35] <Cork> i'm not asking "what should be on the page"
[04:25:48] <Cork> i'm asking what needs to be repeated for each category entry
[04:26:48] <Cork> the reason i ask is sure, i can make wild guesses, and give you a structure solution, but it might be a waste of time cause what i give you might not match what you need
[04:27:02] <sigdk> Cork, this:  <div class="panel panel-default">  ... </div>
[04:27:12] <Cork> ok!
[04:27:44] <Cork> should faqHeader be repeated too?
[04:27:49] <sigdk> this corresponds to a single question. But we also need to generate the category it belongs before
[04:28:02] <sigdk> Cork, 1 category has multiple questions
[04:28:14] <sigdk> faqHeader should be there once for a group of questions
[04:32:16] <Cork> sigdk: a bit of psudo code, but something like this https://jsfiddle.net/d1d5n6qx/18/
[04:32:32] <Cork> note, don't append the category BEFORE you've added all the questions inside it
[04:32:57] <Cork> that would slow down the loop an order of magnitude
[04:33:16] <Cork> the newObject to .append is meant to be in the loop of the response from the server
[04:33:47] <Cork> and then you need a similar (maybe) script section for question-template
[04:34:52] <sigdk> Cork, hmm, I'll study it
[04:35:21] <sigdk> Cork, btw, is single quotes prefered in jquery over double?
[04:35:32] <Cork> not really
[04:35:46] <Cork> its just an OLD habbit of me to write html with "" and js with ''
[04:35:56] <Cork> makes it easier if you ever had to embed html in a js string
[04:36:06] <Cork> '<elm attr="value">'
[04:36:43] <Cork> been writing js sense document.write was the new hotness for dynamic page updates :D
[04:53:13] <RandomNoob> Cork: I need the input value which is in that form with this buttons.
[04:53:46] <Cork> RandomNoob: there are multiple imputs, even multiple ones for each group
[04:54:24] <Justice> Im trying to get input value from input fields however when doing $(document).on('input', dosomething($(this).val())) seems to not work.
[04:54:41] <Cork> Justice: you need a function around the doSomething call
[04:54:52] <Justice> Cork: tried that too
[04:54:53] <Cork> alternatively you can do $(this).val() inside that function
[04:54:57] <RandomNoob> Cork: input button button. Just need the idea how to get input value when clicked button. In that big inputs and buttons.
[04:55:17] <Cork> RandomNoob: there isn't a generic answer
[04:55:22] <Cork> it depends on what field from where
[04:56:02] <Cork> RandomNoob: well there is a generic answer, but i'm not sure it will help you "find the shared parent and find the input field from there"
[04:57:01] <RandomNoob> Cork: Then I try to catch button click event. and check with if else statement which buttons id have it. depending on it I will request input value by id. I think this will hardcoded
[04:57:40] <Cork> RandomNoob: ya, the select input by id i would recommend against
[04:57:48] <Justice> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/ifinto/o2gxgz9r/
[04:57:58] <Cork> there are a tendency to be overly reliant on ids in web development
[04:58:15] <Cork> and that has the down side of forcing everything to always have to be copied for each element
[04:58:22] <Cork> as the code becomes unique for each element
[04:58:57] <Cork> Justice: ? how is that related to the question you just made?
[04:59:26] <Justice> Cork: gah wrong fiddle :P
[04:59:35] <Cork> heh
[05:00:05] <Justice> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/813yktsb/
[05:00:25] <Justice> just found some random fiddle on google and went with it as template forgot to fork it
[05:00:48] <Cork> ah, right
[05:00:58] <Cork> you want the element it came from not this
[05:01:09] <Cork> Justice: http://jsfiddle.net/813yktsb/1/
[05:01:53] <Justice> isnt the input the element in this case?
[05:02:02] <Cork> Justice: or simply http://jsfiddle.net/813yktsb/2/
[05:02:09] <Cork> no the document was
[05:02:21] <Cork> --> $(document).on('input')
[05:02:37] <Cork> $(document).on('input', ':input' <--
[05:02:49] <Justice> oh so this was just $document makes sense
[05:03:16] <Justice> thought it would be the element that triggered it.
[05:03:26] <Cork> nope it is the element the handler exists on
[05:03:37] <Cork> event.target is always the source element
[05:03:44] <Justice> hm the first one seems more obvious with passing values seems more readable =)
[05:03:48] <Cork> though that can be confusing for ex. <a> tags
[05:04:10] <Cork> Justice: you have to create an extra function for that solution so...
[05:04:16] <Cork> i would personally prefer the second
[05:04:27] <Cork> unless you plan to do things not in doSomething for the input
[05:05:09] <Cork> like function() { doSomething($(this).val()); doSomethingElse($(this).val()); }
[05:05:17] <Cork> cause then the extra function makes sense
[05:05:46] <Justice> mmh, but i really disslike the way of passing 'hidden' params :P
[05:05:56] <Cork> it isn't hidden
[05:06:02] <Cork> it is the special this variable
[05:06:11] <Cork> it is a basic feature of javascript
[05:06:44] <Cork> function test() { return this.exist }; test.call({ exist: true }) == true
[05:08:04] <Justice> hm
[05:30:16] <Jesper___> Hi all, I have a problem using flexbox. I made a table, with a headline and a footer, but for some reason the headline is hidden - I can see it, if I cancel my overflow: hidden in my css. Here's the jsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/7x1zz25x/2/
[05:30:22] <Jesper___> Any help would be greatly appreciated
[05:41:13] <Cork> Jesper___: that should prob be a question for #css
[05:43:09] <Cork> Jesper___: its the height you've set that is causing it
[05:43:32] <Cork> and in the conjunction with align-items: center;
[05:44:05] <Jesper___> @Cork I'm not sure how that is causing it? However, I tried removing justify-content, and this seems to have fixed it, but I don't understand why :S
[05:44:06] <Cork> opps, sorry meant justify-content: center
[05:44:19] <Cork> Jesper___: https://jsfiddle.net/7x1zz25x/3/
[05:44:41] <Cork> with justify-content: center it will try to center the column in the possible area
[05:44:51] <Cork> meaning the table top will get a negative top offset
[05:44:59] <Jesper___> @Cork hmm - Maybe I misunderstood, but I just understood it as justify-content, centers the div horizontally
[05:45:11] <Cork> the div?
[05:45:18] <Cork> the div is the flex parent
[05:45:20] <Jesper___> well, the element
[05:45:35] <Cork> the h3 and table is the flex elements
[05:45:35] <Jesper___> yeah sorry, my choice of words where wrong
[05:45:44] <Jesper___> I ment justify all its elements to the center horizontally
[05:45:55] <Cork> no, that isn't what it does
[05:46:03] <Jesper___> oh really? :S
[05:46:33] <Cork> if you check the resulting /3/ you will see the proof :)
[05:46:36] <Jesper___> As I understood it, justify content: center, centers every element horizontally, and align-items: center, centers every element vertically
[05:46:50] <Jesper___> Yeah, I looked at it shortly, will take a deeper look :) thanks :)
[05:46:54] <Cork> in a row direction ya
[05:46:57] <Cork> but you have column
[05:47:16] <Cork> so every things gets rotated 90dec
[05:47:23] <Jesper___> oooooh
[05:47:27] <Jesper___> That makes sense!
[05:47:45] <Cork> anyway this really is a question for #css as it has nothing to do with jquery
[05:48:20] <Jesper___> Yeah, sorry, I haven't really seen the css channel before, only been in here, and got lots of help, so thanks :)
[05:48:39] <Jesper___> @Cork Hope this is not asking too much, but what exactly does justify-content: top affect? If I remove it, I dont see any change
[05:48:55] <Cork> Jesper___: the default is top so... :)
[05:49:01] <Jesper___> oh :S
[05:49:52] <Cork> Jesper___: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content
[05:50:01] <Cork> might help you understand
[05:50:14] <Cork> lol and top doesn't even exist -_-'
[05:50:19] <Cork> its called flex-start :/
[05:50:22] <Jesper___> Thanks, I'll take a look at it - You've helped a lot mate, don't know what I should've done without it :)
[05:50:49] <Cork> hay flexbox is fairly new for everyone so no biggie :)
[05:51:48] <Cork> Jesper___: btw https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self is what you're looking for
[05:52:02] <Cork> Jesper___: it sets how the different flex elements align to each other
[05:52:08] <Cork> you don't set it on the parent though
[06:33:03] <sigdk> <Cork> note, don't append the category BEFORE you've added all the questions inside it     you mean Find a category, populate all questions inside, go to the next category
[06:33:35] <sigdk> INSTEAD OF, populate all categorie divs, then for each category, populate the questions inside
[06:33:37] <sigdk> correct?
[06:33:42] <Cork> sigdk: i mean run the code where you construct the category element, then loop for each question and append them to the category element tree
[06:33:49] <Cork> THEN append the category to the oage
[06:33:51] <Cork> *page
[06:34:24] <Cork> instead of create the category element, set the text, append it, loop questions and append that inside the category appended to the page
[06:34:31] <sigdk> okay, I get it
[06:34:38] <Cork> the later solutions mean the browser will do a reflow for every time you add a question
[06:35:03] <Cork> and that is the most expensive action you can get the browser to do, so you want to keep that to a minimum
[07:18:38] <dhecar> Hi, i'm triying to create KitchenScreen in Odoo POS that use javascript and Jquery . I have this code: http://pastebin.com/bbbtyAFe With it I can render the order and the lines, but I have a problem in line 29 . I need to discriminate the lines for each order, and only append the class for the correct Order. Now If I create two orders, the lines in second order appears in the fisrts too --> https://snag.gy/7u3yev.jpg ..  how can I do that?
[08:49:42] <sigdk> Cork, for this: https://jsfiddle.net/d1d5n6qx/19/    Can I use something else to fetch the elements instead of .find()  ? Maybe if I had ids?
[08:54:25] <MikeD_> what have you got against .find()?
[08:55:15] <MikeD_> if you use id in your template, you'll have to update the ids so they don't collide with existing id
[08:56:38] <KnightsOfNi> Hi, I have this form which has a url field where you can put a link to an image on the web. I need to send the data from that image to the server as a file type form element. Is this possible?
[09:00:25] <sigdk> MikeD_ okay, first of all, this "template-thing" looks a bit hacky to me
[09:05:29] <sigdk> MikeD_, any idea how can I change the value of href="#collapseThree" with javascript?
[09:21:35] <MikeD_> i've never seen html stored in a script tag like that, but it's the kind of weird that someone thinks is a good idea "for reasons"
[09:22:41] <MikeD_> the only way you'll be able to change any of it is after you store it in "template" you could manipulate it before you use it to make newObj
[09:22:57] <MagnusVortex> Cork: Thanks! It turns out I had fixed my response headers unintentionally (a side effect of rewriting server code the right way) and in doing so broke my script.
[09:23:54] <Cork> heh, yep, classic :)
[09:24:23] <Cork> MikeD_: it is a fairly common structure for templates
[09:24:48] <Cork> MikeD_: so common that the structure has gotten its own tag in html (<template>)
[09:25:44] <MikeD_> yeah, i can see how it's useful - but i wouldn't abuse the script tag like that
[09:26:02] <MikeD_> and a dedicated template tag is a nice feature
[09:26:02] <Cork> MikeD_: it isn't abusing
[09:26:29] <Cork> <script type="text/template"> isn't javascript, and you state that it is a template
[09:26:35] <Cork> so nothing bad about it
[09:26:45] <Cork> and the best part is you don't parse it to dom before hand
[09:27:03] <Cork> so it doesn't slow down the dom
[09:27:26] <MikeD_> yeah, so text/template makes it a "script" that's not a script
[09:27:36] <Cork> sure a template is a script too
[09:27:39] <MikeD_> what other type of script are available?
[09:27:40] <Cork> it isn't javascript though
[09:28:02] <Cork> now days there is only text/javascript that the browser actively manage
[09:28:06] <MikeD_> so can you load a script tag with text/json ?
[09:28:15] <Cork> ya
[09:28:22] <Cork> and there is typescript and coffiescript
[09:28:27] <Cork> those are similar and parsed by js
[09:28:33] <MikeD_> i don't mean to run it, just to store a static object in it
[09:28:38] <Cork> (a js script enterprit it to normal js)
[09:28:46] <MikeD_> yeah, bad contrived example
[09:28:54] <Cork> a script doesn't mean running code
[09:29:12] <MikeD_> what about a bunch of image data?
[09:29:32] <Cork> that wouldn't be possible to store in a script tag without encoding
[09:29:41] <Cork> and sure, it is possible, just like you can store it in json
[09:29:46] <Cork> but it is very ineffective
[09:30:27] <Cork> MikeD_: just to make a point http://www.dictionary.com/browse/script
[09:30:30] <MikeD_> well, i understand.  I still think it's weird.
[09:30:43] <Cork> point 2 is exactly what a template would fall under
[09:30:48] <MikeD_> scrum -bbiab
[09:32:36] <sigdk> Cork, where is the mistake here? https://jsfiddle.net/suzms747/5/ ?  Shouldn't a Hello World be printed?
[09:33:24] <Cork> sigdk: missed .ready wrapping https://jsfiddle.net/suzms747/6/
[09:34:08] <sigdk> Cork, lol... again :)
[09:34:14] <sigdk> let me extend it a bit
[09:34:43] <Cork> sigdk: why don't you just leave the load type at onload?
[09:34:53] <Cork> then you wouldn't have to fall into this problem
[09:35:59] <sigdk> Cork, if I remember correctly, I read that it's preferable to put the js code at head
[09:39:33] <sigdk> Cork, can I use $("selector") instead of "find" here: https://jsfiddle.net/d1d5n6qx/19/  ?
[09:41:40] <sequel> Guys, I've small question. .siblings() return two things [div.a, div.b] if i do siblings('.b') it doesn't return anything. how is it possible to do it then?
[09:42:39] <sequel> oh my bad
[09:42:45] <sequel> i was looking for inner selectors
[09:46:37] <taplar> sigdk: javascript at the bottom of the body is the preferred placement
[09:46:50] <taplar> it removes the need for a ready()
[09:47:05] <taplar> and doesn't block other content loading while the script is retrieved and parsed and ran
[09:48:33] <MagnusVortex> taplar: was this something that changed in the past decade or 2?
[09:48:46] <taplar> what do you mean?
[09:48:59] <MagnusVortex> I also seem to recall a recommendation to put it in the header, but that was a long time ago...
[09:49:47] <taplar> script loaded in the header is ran, without a document ready, is ran before the body is loaded.  as such, if it needs to access anything in the body, it will not be able to do so, which is why a ready exists
[09:49:57] <taplar> putting it in the bottom of the body removes this need
[09:50:28] <stennowork> ah there is also .querySelector, thats useful
[09:50:30] <taplar> also at least one version of IE does not play well with document ready and reverts an on load manner, which greatly expands the issue
[09:50:38] <stennowork> as opposed to .querySelectorAll
[09:51:58] <MagnusVortex> if the script is external to the html page(needs to be fetched seperately), would there have been a minor efficiency improvement to put the link in the header vs the body?
[09:52:32] <taplar> no, and loading it in the header, the browser will retrieve the script and run it before parsing the rest of the document in the dom
[09:52:41] <taplar> so you are adding, slight, delay of the body rendering
[09:52:49] <Cork> sigdk: about the .find, no $('selector') is short for $(document).find('selector')
[09:53:02] <Cork> sigdk: and newObj isn't in the document yet
[09:54:12] <Cork> taplar: also about the script in body, there are async attributes for script tags so you can still have them in the head without the blocking
[09:54:15] <MagnusVortex> if your script consists exclusively of functions, and you have dom objects that utilize those function on manipulation
[09:54:23] <taplar> oh really?
[09:54:47] <Cork> taplar: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#Attributes
[09:54:50] <MagnusVortex> is there a situation where the object could be loaded and manipulated but the script not available?
[09:54:54] <taplar> MagnusVortex: I did say if your script needs to access body elements
[09:54:57] <MagnusVortex> (now or in the past)?
[09:55:06] <taplar> this is all contextual
[09:55:19] <MagnusVortex> I'm just trying to figure out why the hell I have my scripts in my header
[09:55:19] <Cork> and there is the defer that also makes the $() needless
[09:55:34] <taplar> interesting
[09:55:59] <Cork> used to be a nogo (both) as ie < 10 i think doesn't support it
[09:56:40] <taplar> MagnusVortex: i used to put them in the head too.  but usually i wasn't in desperate need to tweak out every ounce of performance
[09:57:02] <taplar> but in this age of some sites trying to be mobile sites and perform like system apps, performance needs grew
[09:57:10] <MagnusVortex> is it possible to put dom objects in the header?
[09:57:10] <taplar> imho
[09:57:23] <Cork> MagnusVortex: if you go back to spec for html 3.x script wasn't valid (at all) outside the header
[09:57:37] <Cork> and it is still lexically the "correct" place
[09:57:54] <MagnusVortex> ohhhhhh
[09:57:57] <MagnusVortex> that totally explains it
[09:58:07] <Cork> but since 4.x on they allowed scripts in body to make it easier for cms systems
[09:58:22] <MagnusVortex> Okay, thanks for clearing that up
[09:58:34] <Cork> and now days they even allow <style> in body too so...
[09:58:45] <Cork> <head> is basically just for <title> now days :)
[09:58:48] <MagnusVortex> so we don't need no stinkin' head
[09:58:54] <Cork> you do
[09:59:01] <taplar> and metas no?
[09:59:05] <Cork> <head><title></title></head> is mandatory
[09:59:19] <Cork> meata belongs in the http headers
[09:59:24] <Cork> *meta
[09:59:41] <Cork> the <meta> is only for when ppl can't control the server scripts
[09:59:55] <taplar> ah
[09:59:59] <taplar> never thought about that
[10:00:03] <taplar> *honestly
[10:00:23] <MagnusVortex> Okay, so I'll be moving my scripts to the end of the body next chance I get
[10:00:39] <MagnusVortex> (and adding the <title> element)
[10:00:50] <MagnusVortex> Thanks Cork and taplar_meeting
[10:21:30] * taplar can't wait to pickup his new monitor this evening
[10:21:51] <MagnusVortex> oh?
[10:21:58] <taplar> predator x34, :D
[10:22:09] <MagnusVortex> adding it to an array or replacing one?
[10:22:20] <taplar> replacing a 24" widescreen
[10:22:28] <taplar> though i may keep that one around as a secondary
[10:24:01] <MagnusVortex> I'd recommend it
[10:24:29] <MagnusVortex> although, it could be strenuous for your video card to run a game with the second monitor up
[10:24:44] <taplar> just got a new 1080, ;)
[10:24:52] <MagnusVortex> WELL NEVERMIND THEN
[10:25:05] * MagnusVortex is just jealous
[10:25:40] <taplar> heh, i go years being all scrooge christmas and birthday wise to myself, and then out of the blue i'll just drop some dough
[10:25:50] <MagnusVortex> I'm the same way
[10:26:10] <MagnusVortex> I built my PC about 4 years ago
[10:26:31] <taplar> mine is about that old
[10:26:40] <MagnusVortex> last year my friends and brother pitched in a bought me a 970 for it - I hadn't had a card at all the entire time
[10:27:03] <taplar> do you use pcpartpicker or any such site?
[10:27:07] <MagnusVortex> I do
[10:27:10] <MagnusVortex> that exact one
[10:27:31] <taplar> my previous rig i built without that, and when i found that site it was instant love
[10:28:02] <MagnusVortex> yeah, that site's amazing
[10:28:31] <MagnusVortex> this year, though, I've promised myself we're getting a new gaming console
[10:28:40] <taplar> oh?  going switch?
[10:28:42] <MagnusVortex> the Wii just isn't cutting it anymore
[10:28:47] <MagnusVortex> maybe
[10:28:57] <MagnusVortex> I've got a 4K TV now (won it at the company christmas party)
[10:29:04] <taplar> nice
[10:29:08] <MagnusVortex> so I'm hoping to get something with native 4K
[10:29:25] <taplar> does that exist yet?
[10:29:34] <MagnusVortex> if nothing's available by then, I'll probably get the switch
[10:30:42] <taplar> we usually hang one gen back as far as platforms go.  still playing ps3 stuff
[10:30:53] <taplar> get the games on the cheap
[10:31:04] <aprilfool> hello! :)
[10:31:10] <taplar> hola
[10:31:18] <MagnusVortex> Greetings!
[10:32:48] <aprilfool> I'm trying to change the selected value of a SELECT input on load, but I guess the thing isn't loaded on $(document).ready()
[10:32:50] <aprilfool> $(document).ready(function () {
[10:32:51] <aprilfool> 		var country = '<?php echo $user->country;?>';
[10:32:51] <aprilfool> 		var state = '<?php echo $user->state;?>';
[10:32:51] <aprilfool> 		$("#countryselect").val(country);
[10:32:51] <aprilfool> 		$("#stateselect").val(state);
[10:32:53] <aprilfool> 	});
[10:33:04] <Cork> aprilfool: don't dump code in the channel
[10:33:06] <Cork> make a jsfiddle.net
[10:33:13] <aprilfool> whoops sorry
[10:33:20] <aprilfool> well, it's there now
[10:33:27] <taplar> and is this script being generated by php or is it in a js file?
[10:33:46] <aprilfool> it's now in <script> tags
[10:33:57] <taplar> oh
[10:34:04] <Cork> then make sure the country value and state value is correct when js sees it
[10:34:24] <taplar> i think he's saying he left off the script tags
[10:34:47] <Cork> my point was the php script might be echoing values he didn't expect
[10:35:02] <Cork> and as he only looks at it in the pre generation state, it might look like it should be correct
[10:35:17] <Cork> always debug what js sees in these cases
[10:35:24] <Cork> not what the server sees
[10:43:49] <btracht00> using jquery validate, how can i require letters and numbers in a password field?
[10:44:18] <btracht00> i get that i would use addMethod but what would the return value be?
[10:45:25] <taplar> have you tried doing numbers: true, digits: true?
[10:45:33] <taplar> *number
[10:46:17] <taplar> err, digits: true, not numbers.  not seeing the alphanumeric rule yet
[10:46:38] <taplar> may have to just write a custom validator
[10:46:46] <btracht00> i have not. https://jqueryvalidation.org/digits-method/ says digits: true is digits only
[10:47:32] <taplar> yeah, i don't see an alphanumeric predefined one, so probably going to have to write a custom
[10:47:57] <taplar> the return value is true or false
[10:48:14] <btracht00> i'll try it
[10:48:21] <hlve> I'll try you.
[10:48:22] <hlve> ;)
[10:49:24] <taplar> clear
[10:49:39] <taplar> bad git command, bad!
[10:50:17] <hlve>  /clear ?
[10:50:25] <hlve> OH NO WHERE DID MY TEXT GOES.
[10:50:37] <taplar> nah, i was trying to clear my git terminal and forgot to change focus
[10:54:21] * hlve licks taplar 
[10:54:33] <taplar> well... that happened
[10:59:00] <btracht00> taplar: if i put both nubmer and digit true, it only validates against the first rule listed
[10:59:18] <taplar> yeah, that's not going to work.  you're going to have to do the custom
[11:03:40] <aprilfool> uughhh
[11:04:40] <aprilfool> i was trying to change the value of an input using #aninput while I had the name of the input set as aninput, not the ID
[11:04:45] <aprilfool> derp
[11:04:47] <aprilfool> works now
[11:20:30] * hlve licks #jQuery
[11:20:35] <hlve> I'm in an odd mood today.
[11:30:01] <grimel> Hi, all. I'm using jquery modal dialog and I added a couple of buttons to it ("Yes" and "No") Everything is ok but width of buttons doesn't fit their content - I see something like Ye[s] and N[o] - how can I change it?
[11:30:28] <grimel> I set autoResize: true but it didn't take any effect
[11:31:14] <taplar> got a fiddle?
[11:35:11] <grimel> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/4ouebovn/4/
[11:36:11] <taplar> preferably one that shows the issue
[11:45:08] <Chulbul> There is lag in jquery ajax .. earlier it was workign fine .. delay is apporx 5.10 sec
[11:45:17] <Chulbul> Any idea on how can debug it.
[11:45:24] <Chulbul> root cause.
[11:46:03] <taplar> have you tried to use a rest client to perform the request to see if the delay is there?
[11:46:34] <Chulbul> No.
[11:47:14] <Chulbul> How would know if it's delayed there
[11:47:16] <taplar> you can also look at the request in your dev tools and it can break down where the time is spent
[11:47:33] <Chulbul> In chrome
[11:47:34] <Chulbul> ?
[11:48:14] <taplar> if you are in firefox, and most likely chrome, it can break down the request to show you how much time was done starting the request, waiting for the response, and processing the results
[11:48:29] <Chulbul> let me check
[11:48:59] <taplar> go to your dev tools (F12), go to the network tab, make the request happen and it will show up there.  then click on it to examine it
[11:49:24] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1820927/request-monitoring-in-chrome
[11:50:51] <Chulbul> taplar: let me check, thanks
[11:51:04] <jak2000> hi all
[11:51:13] <taplar> aloha
[11:54:59] <Chulbul> taplar: http://pastebin.com/71HXqCYu
[11:56:23] <Chulbul> so it looks like, content download time is more than 4 seconds. What does it mean and how can i resolve it.
[11:56:56] <taplar> what's the size of the content coming back?
[11:57:07] <taplar> and are you gziping your responses?
[11:58:32] <Chulbul> It so much of data, more than 1460 json key value pairs... multi dimenentional json ..
[11:58:42] <Chulbul> what do you mean by gziping the response ..
[11:59:43] <taplar> gzip is a method of compressing the data that is returned to the client.  most modern day browsers know how to ungzip these so it saves time by decreasing the amount of data you have to send over the wire
[12:00:11] <taplar> you can google for gzip and whatever server/language you are using to find out more information on this
[12:01:06] <Chulbul> Ok, it's PHP
[12:01:12] <Chulbul> let me try to find it
[12:09:58] <TheGrumpyScot> Given an html string (<table>...</table>); how to I extract just the contents of <tbody>...</tbody> within that string ?
[12:11:59] <taplar> $(theHtmlString).find('tbody').html()
[12:12:09] <Chulbul> taplar: It's now in ms .. earlier it was in seconds. And also I feel there is lag on a page on some of the events .. click event and draw highstock chart event ..
[12:12:40] <TheGrumpyScot> taplar: doh - mind going blank - many thanks
[12:13:14] <taplar> you're saying the content download time dropped without you changing anything?
[12:14:59] <Chulbul> taplar: no, after gzipping the json.
[12:15:10] <taplar> ah, awesome
[12:15:30] <Chulbul> But visually it looks same .. taplar
[12:15:39] <Chulbul> May be I'm wrong here.
[12:16:03] <Chulbul> Anywyas, my other problem is that: click events lag after it's loading ..
[12:16:52] <taplar> best I can tell you there is to crack open your dev tools, go to the performance tab, and start poking around to see where your time is being spent
[12:17:44] <Chulbul> taplar: ok
[12:18:06] <taplar> random google https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/chrome-dev-tools-javascript-and-performance--net-29671
[12:18:08] <Chulbul> there is no tab names performance, I'm using Chrome
[12:18:12] <taplar> go to the part about the Timeline Panel
[12:20:51] <Chulbul> taplar_brb: thanks.
[12:42:47] <Kake> Is $.post a call to $.ajax?
[12:43:01] <taplar> yes
[12:43:31] <Kake> Ah, okay. Thanks :)
[12:45:00] <lastaid>  "jQuery.Deferred exception: Cannot read property 'ns' of null", source: *****\UMTSgateway\node_modules\jquery\dist\jquery.js (3846)
[12:45:03] <lastaid> what does this mean
[12:45:16] <lastaid> and why does it only happen if i try to deploy my application with electron :(
[12:47:03] <Caspan> Wondering if someone can help me with a small script
[12:47:04] <Caspan> https://jsbin.com/johufesehu/1/edit?js,output
[12:47:25] <Caspan> if you look i want to get all the values from TD tags and then update a certain span tag
[12:47:47] <Caspan> but seem to be haing issues
[12:48:21] <Caspan> if you look the HTML table TD tags will hold the data-cost, i just want to add them up then put that total in the span.TableToal .html
[12:48:52] <robertmaxrees> i was lateto the party - gotta fiddle Caspan?
[12:49:06] <Caspan> robertmaxrees: https://jsbin.com/johufesehu/1/edit?js,output
[12:49:19] <taplar> yay, rob is here
[12:49:28] * taplar goes back to his wrap
[12:49:35] <robertmaxrees> Caspan soooo
[12:49:47] <robertmaxrees> Caspan why not .map() the values you want and then reduce the resulting array?
[12:49:48] <Caspan> it works with other single row table that i use come one but this i a double row table
[12:50:11] <Caspan> ill have to look up what .map does lol still learning
[12:50:28] <Caspan> let me add some more html here 2 seconds
[12:50:28] <robertmaxrees> Caspan well.
[12:51:16] <robertmaxrees> you just want every data-cost?
[12:51:30] <Caspan> https://jsbin.com/rimutesade/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[12:51:34] <Caspan> Sorry if you look at it now
[12:51:44] <Caspan> youll see that code works on the bottom table
[12:51:54] <Caspan> bot not on the new table that has two items per row
[12:52:15] <robertmaxrees> so you just want to add up every data-cost?
[12:52:38] <Caspan> correct
[12:52:48] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you're way close.
[12:52:55] <robertmaxrees> where do you think you're going wrong?
[12:52:59] <Caspan> then place it in a SPAN in the paretn table with the calss of BudgetTotal
[12:53:06] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time
[12:53:09] <Caspan> okay
[12:53:12] <robertmaxrees> you're looking at it as one big step - break it down.
[12:53:16] <robertmaxrees> where do you think it's broken?
[12:53:26] <Caspan> so i know the TR
[12:53:29] <Caspan> shoudl be TD
[12:53:37] <robertmaxrees> should it?
[12:54:02] <robertmaxrees> looks like every .MoneyJar-Right has what you want, no?
[12:54:16] <Caspan> correct
[12:54:33] <Caspan> the TD holds that value
[12:54:40] <robertmaxrees> *data attribute.
[12:54:41] <robertmaxrees> not value.
[12:54:44] <robertmaxrees> values are for inputs.
[12:54:56] <Caspan> sorry
[12:54:58] <Caspan> correct
[12:54:59] <Caspan> <td nowrap="" class="MoneyJar-Right" data-cost="50.00">
[12:55:03] <robertmaxrees> i can see that ;)
[12:55:14] <Caspan> i really dont care the element
[12:55:19] <robertmaxrees> but you do!
[12:55:27] <robertmaxrees> so why not grab all of those, use .map().get() (the docs explain this) and then .reduce()
[12:55:28] <Caspan> i jsut want to pull all items that have a data-cost on them and add them up
[12:55:30] <robertmaxrees> you're partway there already.
[12:55:45] <robertmaxrees> but you need to klnow where you're grabbing those costs from!
[12:55:54] <robertmaxrees> and MoneyJar-Right is what you want to target.
[12:55:59] <Caspan> $('td', element).get().reduce()
[12:56:04] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[12:56:06] <Caspan> so that should get me all TD correct?
[12:56:12] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn;'t use that here, at least.
[12:56:16] <Caspan> okay
[12:56:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd use a .map()
[12:56:31] <Caspan> sorry just understand that it needs to work for both table jsut FYI
[12:56:39] <Caspan> okay ill look that function up
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:56:43] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[12:56:50] <robertmaxrees> there's a much easier way to do this tho.
[12:56:53] <Caspan> and thank you for the helping hand and not jsut hte answer.. i love learning
[12:57:06] <Caspan> let m look up .map()
[12:57:11] <taplar> why select tds that don't have the info you need?
[12:57:30] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:57:33] <robertmaxrees> that's where i'
[12:57:36] <robertmaxrees> *i'm guiding him.
[12:57:56] <Caspan> exactly i want to capture all elements that have a data-cost proptery set no?
[12:57:57] * taplar can't help piping in while eating
[12:58:20] <Kake> My $.ajax post request redirects the browser to that url. Is that expected?
[12:58:25] <Caspan> dont care if its a TD a TR or a Table..
[12:58:43] <taplar> Kake: where are you calling that from?
[12:59:14] <Kake> I'm calling it from an click handler on a button on a html page
[12:59:15] <taplar> ajax doesn't change the browser url
[12:59:26] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> Caspan you need to have more control over your markup.
[12:59:48] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise this gets WAY nasty way quick.
[13:00:03] <taplar> a <button> ?
[13:00:09] <Caspan> robertmaxrees: should i not select all data-cost items first then perform a function on the values?
[13:00:15] <Kake> Sorry! I forgot to remove my action in the form
[13:00:37] <robertmaxrees> Caspan no.
[13:00:45] <Caspan> There will never be elements with this data-cost propery on them unless they are to be added
[13:00:45] <Kake> Makes me think, why do I even use a form when I'm supposed to use ajax
[13:00:46] <robertmaxrees> Caspan select using classes.
[13:00:47] <taplar> preventDefault in the click handler instead
[13:01:04] <robertmaxrees> Caspan otherwise you're making your markup unpredictable.
[13:01:09] <Caspan> so I could add a class to each element that has a value in it i need
[13:01:09] <taplar> *shrug* really easy to serialize a form for ajax data
[13:01:15] <robertmaxrees> Caspan yep.
[13:01:22] <Caspan> okay let me do that forst
[13:01:24] <Caspan> first
[13:01:27] <robertmaxrees> Caspan why would you have a cost on a tr?
[13:01:34] <robertmaxrees> because you already have MoneyJar-Right
[13:01:39] <Caspan> becasue the table below it
[13:02:10] <Caspan> I guess i could put it on the TD there as well
[13:02:16] <Caspan> insted of the whole row
[13:02:26] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:02:38] <Caspan> i jsut have all my data for each row stored in the TR tag so you can query it
[13:02:48] <Caspan> for the bottom table that is
[13:02:51] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:02:51] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:02:56] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:03:17] <Caspan> because i can then test value to select only ceratin rows when performaing actions on it
[13:03:26] <Caspan> like select all paid bills
[13:03:32] <Caspan> select budget items
[13:03:56] <Caspan> its uses the data- values to query for that information to see what rows to select for the larger program
[13:05:47] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[13:05:48] <Caspan> bingpo
[13:05:55] <robertmaxrees> so Caspan why are you swapping your data structures around?
[13:05:57] <Caspan> I added a calls called .AddMee
[13:06:03] <Caspan> to all and it works
[13:06:07] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:06:11] <Caspan> still sloppy the way i did it
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:06:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:06:27] <Caspan> let me update you to show becasue i am curious about the .map function
[13:08:36] <taplar> what's up with the hard on for map?
[13:10:45] <Caspan> robertmaxrees: https://jsbin.com/tihiqokoya/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:10:50] <Caspan> so there it is working now
[13:11:03] <Caspan> now when you spoke about .map why woudl that be eaysier?
[13:11:46] <Caspan> taplar: No hardon for it was just listening and curious about it if there is a better way i woudl liek to learn
[13:12:13] <taplar> ah, i didn't see where it came from.  just saw you mentioning it a few times
[13:12:39] <taplar> if i could suggest one thing though.  break up that statement.  that one single line of all the things chained is very hard to read
[13:14:40] <Caspan> taplar: Actualy was goignto ask about that
[13:14:46] <Caspan> where are good break points to use
[13:15:07] <Caspan> is there a rule of thumb to create thouse break points
[13:15:14] <GreatDanton> something
[13:15:40] <taplar> it's really personal preference.  Mine is if you can store things in variables to give them names for self documentation, all the better
[13:17:09] <robertmaxrees> hey Caspan why is it that your total isn't in the same tabl?
[13:17:26] <robertmaxrees> this layout is batty
[13:18:10] <Caspan> because that way i can target the bacground of the parent or the child
[13:18:15] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:18:18] <Caspan> I know i coudl use table head and foot
[13:18:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:18:29] <Caspan> jsut have not got there yet
[13:18:30] <robertmaxrees> semantic markup bruddah
[13:18:33] <Caspan> still a work in progress
[13:18:47] <robertmaxrees> like: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t8u857sq/1/
[13:19:07] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[13:20:03] <Caspan> rob but that defeats my nice one linner :)
[13:23:26] <Caspan> also your returns NaN ;P
[13:28:13] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/t8u857sq/2/
[13:30:00] <taplar> the total span doesn't belong to the table you are summing tds for.  it's weirdly in the parent table
[13:31:04] <Caspan> taplar: yeah i know it was a CSS thing i did this for i remember now
[13:31:12] <Caspan> I am going to try to change the format of the table
[13:31:28] <Caspan> but see how i round the  corners
[13:31:36] <Caspan> if i dont nest the table how can I do that?
[13:31:56] <Caspan> i nly wan tthe data in the middle to have that rounded corners to the table and background colors
[13:32:05] <taplar> the fiddles doesn't have borders
[13:32:14] <Caspan> im goign to try playing with TD heads tc
[13:32:16] <Caspan> etc
[13:32:25] <Caspan> sorry the CSS is not in there for that
[13:33:16] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/t8u857sq/3/
[13:33:18] <Caspan> look now
[13:33:36] <Caspan> could i still do that with targeting only the tbody?
[13:33:54] <Caspan> while thead and tfoot woudl have nothign on them
[13:42:34] <taplar> mmm, you might have to ask #css the best way to do that
[15:47:31] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/waubjzz2/9/
[15:47:49] <MikeD_> the idea is to allow someone to enter a weight before they pick the unit of measure for that weight
[15:47:49] * hlve slaps MikeD_ with a trout.
[15:48:28] <MikeD_> it's a little crazy - but people are notoriously bad about fixing unit of measure after they key "220" into the kg box, so this is an attempt to fix broken users
[15:49:08] <MikeD_> is the trout treatment for posting a fiddle or for being the first to speak after an hour of silence?
[15:49:57] <hlve> it's an oldschool mirc thing, but I brought it to my hexchat because I missed that damn trout.
[15:50:03] <hlve> and 'cuz trout is fuckin delicious.
[15:51:00] <MikeD_> oh, i assumed it was bot action - didn't realize you are literally slapping people with trout
[15:51:25] <hlve> it's kinda my thing
[15:51:34] <MikeD_> i believe oldschool was simply a fish, trout was a later invention to be more precise/specific
[15:52:02] <hlve> you believe wrong
[15:52:40] <MikeD_> so who did it first, mIRC or Swedish Chef?
[15:53:04] <hlve> is this some 'what came first, the chicken or the egg' type of shit?
[15:53:08] * hlve glares at mike.
[15:53:18] <MikeD_> i mean, we're this far down the crazy road, so now I want the whole etymology of slapping people with trout
[15:53:37] <MikeD_> is there an RFC number for this?  :p
[15:53:48] <hlve> :P
[15:56:41] <hlve> I'm a broken user, btw.
[15:56:52] <MikeD_> good, that's the target audience
[15:57:29] <MikeD_> so key 100, choose kg, then choose lb, then choose blank, then choose kg
[15:57:36] <hlve> you should make the lbs an int when selected.
[15:57:53] <hlve> no reason for that number to carry a decimal.
[15:58:20] <MikeD_> the real application will have its own number masks and ranges and a ton of other nonsense
[16:00:31] <MikeD_> does the uom-to-blank cause confusion?  should that just reset the number part to nothing when you choose no unit of measure?
[16:01:30] <MagnusVortex> MikeD_: no
[16:01:39] <MagnusVortex> do not lose my number just becuase I misclicked
[16:01:53] <MikeD_> fwiw, that's how I feel about it too
[16:02:16] <MagnusVortex> border the box in red if you have to
[16:02:21] <MagnusVortex> but gorrammit, no losing my work
[16:02:35] <MikeD_> now I can present the argument that "somebody on the internet agreed with me"
[16:05:15] <MikeD_> that's enough for today, thanks
[19:12:09] <mundus2018> Can someone look over a small bit of jQuery, im trying to get it to submit to some data and return the response but it doesnt seem to be working. https://gist.github.com/4c5a0c1eacf0b8afb56e7d5db5b0fae5
[19:26:18] <Al_nz1> I am just working out when to use name on a form input element and when to use id. It appears name is used for anything to be submitted via post to server. id more likely used for CSS and JS?
[19:26:30] <robertmaxrees> pretty much
[19:27:28] <Al_nz1> k
[19:28:45] <Al_nz1> So if a dynamic form allows you to add a group of fields dynamically (like "Add Person" button) then each instance of the group should have the name attribute incremented with a value like surname0, surname1,surname2 etc ?
[19:30:07] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:30:08] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[19:30:18] <robertmaxrees> why not have 1 form = 1 person?
[19:30:22] <robertmaxrees> and then just clonethe form?
[19:31:06] <Al_nz1> you dont want to have surname0 twice on the same form do you?
[19:31:19] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:31:24] <robertmaxrees> but it wouldn't be the same form.
[19:31:26] <robertmaxrees> it'd be two.
[19:31:29] <robertmaxrees> one for each person.
[19:34:11] <dglambert> yo
[19:36:45] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: on this particular form you want to just add some repeating fields. There could be other ways to do it too I aceppt
[19:37:02] <robertmaxrees> i would have one form per person.
[19:37:08] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[19:37:11] <robertmaxrees> that would be the easiest.
[19:38:39] <Al_nz1> yeah, in *hindsight* it would be.
[19:39:51] <robertmaxrees> are you submitting this normally or via ajax?
[19:39:59] <Al_nz1> ajax
[19:41:04] <robertmaxrees> you could use fieldsets and then easily construct your json using that.
[19:46:05] <taplar> mundus2018: you get your issue figured out?
[19:46:15] <mundus2018> I think
[19:54:49] <D-rex> I have 4 select boxes and each is empty until the previous select has an option selected then it gets the next select values via ajax from the database and populates it.   Im trying to make it possible so that the selects can be preselected via the url parameters.  I currently have it selecting the first select value and populating the second select but if I try to set the value of the second select it doesnt set because it was empty upon
[19:54:50] <D-rex> page load (im assuming),  how can I have the second select value set after the options get pulled from database?
[19:55:10] <robertmaxrees> using ajax?
[19:55:16] <robertmaxrees> use .then() off of that call.
[19:55:36] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax(/* yer thing here */).then(function() { /* set stuff here*/ });
[19:58:03] <D-rex> Not so sure I can achieve it that way based on how Im doing it, let me see if I can get a mock up in a fiddle
[20:46:53] <dRealm> How can I scroll down in jquery?
[21:30:20] <mmmveggies> $(window).scrollTo(1000) or whatever
[21:30:59] <mmmveggies> If you want to scroll to an anchor tag, location.href("#idOfAnchor") or whatever
[22:29:15] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/padkunx4/ anyone able to tell me why this isnt working.i feel im missing something small.
[22:29:30] <DexDeadly> name copies but nothing after.
[23:13:28] <talkJS> do you have to .each() when using removeAttr()?  Example;    $('.test').find('option[data-t="1"]').filter(':disabled').removeAttr('disabled')
