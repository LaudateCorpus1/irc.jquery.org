[19:48:42] <dunnousernamefn> Hey, I'm trying to visit a relative link (something like 3.html?param1=42), and I wasn't sure how to do it. I tried using something like https://hastebin.com/onozokeqix.js . It didn't work... also, I'm not sure if that code is optimal, and if it isn't, does anyone know a simpler way?
[19:49:14] <dunnousernamefn> It appends the link to the body but doesn't click it
