[05:45:28] <toothfairy_> Hi ... Having some trouble with an .append(), how to successfully include <script> tag snippet within the append?  (#13), it seems to mess up the page when including it...
[05:46:42] <preference> you mean you want to append code?
[05:48:46] <Cork> toothfairy_: script tags cause problem when they are in the page so jquery have dedicated code that removes it and runs it as global eval
[05:48:51] <toothfairy_> preference: yes, its suppose to append code into the page, works fine when excluding the <script>..</script> part starting at #13
[05:49:27] <toothfairy_> Cork: oh, ok I understand.. So what would be a good way to include the code in this situation you think?
[05:50:21] <Cork> toothfairy_: you would have to show exactly what you're trying to do
[05:50:30] <Cork> it depends on the situation
[06:10:57] <jquery553> hi there
[06:11:12] <jquery553> is there a way to make dom manipulations faster?
[06:14:54] <MaritimeHistory> hi
[06:20:20] <jomofcw> Hello !
[06:21:19] <jomofcw> How can I avoid an event to trigger ? In this example : https://codepen.io/jomofcw/pen/PaVMLb I want to avoid the handle on the A clic to trigger, but it doesn't work. What's wrong, please ?
[06:55:47] <AdamPDotty> start with sane indentation
[07:02:35] <ryan_ford> jquery553: what kind of dom manipulations?
[07:05:29] <ryan_ford> general advice would be to trigger as few paints as possible
[07:15:09] <Cork> jomofcw: you should leave events be if you can
[07:15:23] <Cork> jomofcw: it is a big future liability to kill events
[07:16:02] <Cork> jomofcw: also you kill the event on the div but it happens on the child a
[07:39:36] <syniseth> Hey guys I was wondering why this happens:  when I use arrow function syntax the " on('click', " method detects $(this) as the html document, I have to use "function () {}" syntax for it to detect the clicked div as $(this).
[07:41:37] <preference> if you click on the document as the trigger, then "this" will be what you've just clicked on -- the document
[07:42:06] <syniseth> I clicked on the div that I have styled as a square button
[07:42:34] <syniseth> when I use arrow function syntax it will detect it as "HTML document", switching to regular anonymous function works correctly idk why
[07:43:52] <Cork> syniseth: arrow function don't have a this variable
[07:44:27] <Cork> it is one of the big changes they did when they added fat arrow
[07:45:09] <Cork> syniseth: at the same time they added currentTarget to the event object
[07:45:26] <Cork> so $(event.currentTarget) should be the same as the old $(this)
[07:47:07] <syniseth> @Cork Thank you for the heads up, I'm really new at this. Do you know the equivalent in pure JS too?
[07:47:19] <Cork> syniseth: same
[07:48:09] <Cork> addEventListener('click', (event) => event.currentTarget.classList.add('clicked'));
[07:48:34] <syniseth> Oh, I see, I have to pass in the 'event' as an argument
[07:48:49] <Cork> yes, same as with the old anonymous functions
[07:49:00] <Cork> addEventListener('click', function(event) { event.currentTarget.classList.add('clicked') });
[07:49:17] <Cork> or addEventListener('click', function(event) { this.classList.add('clicked') });
[07:50:03] <syniseth> Awesome, TYVM :D!
[08:09:17] <toothfairy_> Cork: This is what I am trying to do> https://dpaste.de/u89S  excuse my late reply ...
[08:10:05] <toothfairy_> Cork: works fine except for when including line 27 - 30
[08:11:05] <Cork> toothfairy_: so just run it on line 34
[08:11:19] <Cork> why eval it just have it directly in the function
[08:12:34] <toothfairy_> Cork: but hmm, each #bonus-display needs an unique <script>...</script>
[08:12:37] <Cork> or even better, have it at line 41 so you just run it once for the entire loop
[08:12:54] <Cork> toothfairy_: why, the code isn't uniq for where it is
[08:13:09] <Cork>  $(".circle-score").text(); find the text of the first .circle-score in the page
[08:13:29] <Cork> $(".score-fill").css("height",score); set all score-fill in the page to the height of score
[08:14:42] <Cork> toothfairy_: the best solution might be to not use a template for these elements and instead grab the dom element and handle it from there
[08:18:02] <Cork> toothfairy_: something like https://jsfiddle.net/k265j0u7/3/
[08:21:00] <toothfairy_> tnx Cork, will try
[08:21:46] <toothfairy_> looks good
[08:25:07] <Cork> toothfairy_: btw when we're at it you should avoid appending in a loop
[08:26:05] <Cork> toothfairy_: so i would recommend this instead https://jsfiddle.net/k265j0u7/5/
[08:33:54] <jomofcw> hello Cork ! Thanks for answering. Hm, so there is no way to "block" the event gandler to trigger from the parent ? This is about guiding the user to click the first step before each others.
[08:34:30] <Cork> jomofcw: you can't block something from happening before you're called
[08:35:16] <Cork> jomofcw: but the point was handle it in the event handler instead of killing the event
[08:35:58] <Cork> cause you know that event handler won't ever want to handle that event; you do not know that you won't ever want that event for anything else in the future
[08:37:54] <preference> i wonder if xarg has looped through every guest nick in the database by now
[08:41:51] <Cork> freenode had a nickserv problem about a month ago
[08:42:00] <Cork> he has been unauthenticated ever since
[08:43:08] <jomofcw> Cork OK I get it :).
[08:46:00] <jomofcw> Another question (I think I already asked it in the past but can't remember the answer) : Why, in the response of an AJAX request, to get the element "#myID' from the response sometime I have to use ".find()" and sometimes I have to use ".filter()" ?
[08:48:14] * AdamPDotty got too many clever responses to that.
[08:49:09] <shoky_> jomofcw: .find() for when #myID is a descendant of a top-level element,  .filter() for when #myID is itself a top-level element  (in the response html)
[08:50:20] <Cork> so a little simpler explained, it depends on if the #myID is a child in the response or not
[08:50:54] <Cork> '<div></div><div id="myID"></div>' vs '<div><div id="myID"></div></div>'
[08:54:08] <jomofcw> Cork shoky_ : OK understand ! Thanks. So, another question : is there a way to preserve the full response structure includinh body/head elements ?
[08:54:35] <Cork> jomofcw: preserve? what do you mean?
[08:54:40] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[08:54:52] <jomofcw> "keep"
[08:54:57] <Cork> ...
[08:55:00] <Cork> i didn't mean the word...
[08:55:19] <Cork> what do you want to do with it?
[08:55:59] <jomofcw> curently when i convert it into a jquery object (e.g. "$(ajaxData)") it seems to "remove" the head/body elements putting it's contents into a "virtual main root element".
[08:56:25] <Cork> ya, cause header and body objects aren't valid in a fragment element
[08:56:50] <Cork> you can't have those elements in a page they are meta elements used on original parse and only the original page can have them
[08:57:03] <Cork> a partial page load shouldn't have those elements to begin with
[08:57:25] <jomofcw> Cork OK sounds logical. But so, I can't know what was in the head and what was in the body afterward, right ?
[08:57:48] <Cork> you can search in the raw text
[08:59:01] <jomofcw> Cork hm it will involve to partialy parse HTML using regexp, and i'm pretty sure you'll inadvise it to me :P.
[08:59:27] <jomofcw> So, I'm probably wrong on the way I'm trying to achieve it.
[09:01:36] <Cork> jomofcw: my point of view is if you have body or header in a ajax response your "doing it wrong"
[09:01:44] <Cork> but i'm a purist when it comes to ajax calls so...
[09:02:19] <Cork> i'm not a fan of "the server sends what ever junk it wants, then i clean it up in js"
[09:03:45] <jomofcw> Cork I like to be a purist too xD. You're right, I may not send a junk response.
[09:03:57] <shoky_> you don't need to be a purist, it's just better :p
[09:04:17] <jomofcw> shoky_ probably right :p (but I guess you're a purist too xD)
[09:04:23] <shoky_> ;]
[09:04:37] <jomofcw> Last question : why "$(ajaxData).html()" doesn't return anything ?
[09:05:04] <Cork> unanswerable without knowing what ajaxData is
[09:05:47] <Cork> might be you have '<iframe src="something.html"></iframe>' and iframe of that would be ''
[09:06:16] <Cork> uh and s/iframe of that/inlineHTML of that/
[09:06:41] <Cork> T_T gah inner *sigh*
[09:07:28] <jomofcw> xD
[09:07:34] <jomofcw> Cork it's a basic HTML response
[09:07:50] <Cork> jomofcw: that isn't an answer
[09:07:54] <jomofcw> in fact, my junk response curently, with head/body element in it.
[09:08:06] <Cork> there are a lot of different formats for "HTML response"
[09:08:37] <Cork> .html() will grab the innerHTML content of the first valid dom element in the response
[09:09:13] <Cork> so if you have <body><a></a><p>the rest of the document</p></body> you will get an empty string cause a is empty
[09:09:30] <Cork> (and body is invalid so it is removed)
[09:11:14] <jomofcw> Cork OK, that's why I get an empty return for .html() : my first element is a META that was in the head.
[09:11:27] <Cork> no cause those aren't elements
[09:11:33] <Cork> as they aren't inside body (so invalid)
[09:11:57] <jomofcw> Cork but still keeping, I've just test it.
[09:11:59] <Cork> you need to think what the dom can represent, not what the server sends
[09:12:32] <jomofcw> for example in a simple HTML response like "<html><head><title>title</title></head><body><div>content</div></body></html>", title will be the first element
[09:12:46] <jomofcw> (in fact in my previous test, wasn't a META but a LINK element).
[09:15:03] <Cork> jomofcw: you have to provide an example of the problem you're facing, error corrected html is a mess to predict
[09:19:31] <jomofcw> Cork hard to reproduce ajax loading in a codepen :/
[09:19:41] <Cork> use a jsfiddle then
[09:23:52] <jomofcw> Cork : https://jsfiddle.net/2b5co748/2/
[09:42:39] * AdamPDotty can't think of an example where function(data){return $(data).html();} would yield something interesting.
[09:56:49] <Cork> jomofcw: that is cause the first node in the parsed response is a textnode (without a wrapping parent) so .html() on it becomes "undefined"
[09:58:43] <Cork> jomofcw: https://jsfiddle.net/2b5co748/8/
[09:59:06] <Cork> and this is actually quite a good example of why you shouldn't send full webpages to ajax responses
[10:04:23] <CorsairX> Hi all
[10:04:49] <CorsairX> I have a question about detecting change in a text box
[10:05:27] <CorsairX> I have the following code per this fiddle
[10:05:28] <CorsairX> http://jsfiddle.net/rL7js8g6/5/
[10:06:10] <CorsairX> In my real environment, I have this code in a .js file included after JQuery
[10:06:30] <CorsairX> However, for some reason the event fails to fire whereas in the fiddle it does work
[10:07:14] <Cork> CorsairX: .change(func) is a shorthand for .on('change', func) and that one binds the event handler directly on the element $() finds
[10:07:16] <CorsairX> Secondly, there are multiple rows with the same id - ideally, I'd like to validate the text value from the input and update it
[10:07:34] <Cork> CorsairX: if that element doesn't exist when the selector runs the event handler won't ever bind to anything
[10:08:01] <Cork> so make sure you have added the form when the selector runs, else you want to use a delegated event handler instead
[10:08:13] <CorsairX> Could that happen if the js file is loaded before the HTML finishes?
[10:08:32] <Cork> not if you use ready ($(func))
[10:08:49] <jomofcw> Cork OK thanks :).
[10:08:52] <Cork> so the code you have in the fiddle would be fine as long as the elements are static
[10:09:05] <jomofcw> Cork I've rework my server side script to just send the usefull element ;).
[10:09:09] <jomofcw> *elements
[10:09:32] <CorsairX> Ah - they're not, I actually think you helped me with dynamically adding rows the other night
[10:09:34] <Cork> CorsairX: so if you add the field with js "later" that code won't see that
[10:09:51] <Cork> ya, so you want delegated event listeners
[10:10:09] <Cork> CorsairX: read http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[10:10:25] <CorsairX> Having a read now, thanks
[10:11:03] <CorsairX> I should add though that it fails to fire even with the default initial row that is static
[10:11:39] <Cork> CorsairX: that is quite easy to test though
[10:12:01] <Cork> just add console.log($('#timechecker').length) before the .change() line
[10:12:18] <Cork> if you get a 1 in the console the event handler is solid and something else fails
[10:12:31] <Cork> if you get 0, it means the element doesn't exist when the listener is trying to bind
[10:14:08] <CorsairX> I do get a 1
[10:15:00] <Cork> btw are you sure you want change and not input?
[10:15:10] <Cork> change only fires when you move away from an input field
[10:15:20] <Cork> while the input event fires when you modify it
[10:16:47] <CorsairX> In this case, yes - ideally I'd like the user to put in a time value that is close enough (1300 or 13.00 for example)
[10:17:37] <CorsairX> If it's close enough, it can be converted to 13:00
[10:18:04] <CorsairX> If there is anything really strange (non numerics etc) service side validation will catch it
[10:19:06] <CorsairX> It's meant more as a visual cue that things are ok
[10:27:21] <CorsairX> http://jsfiddle.net/rL7js8g6/15/
[10:27:59] <CorsairX> I implemented the delegate listener and that seems to work
[10:28:29] <CorsairX> Now I just need to figure out how to update the input field that generated the event
[10:29:01] <Cork> $(this).val()
[10:51:16] <CorsairX> Hey
[10:51:41] <CorsairX> Just for the record, this worked http://jsfiddle.net/rL7js8g6/17/
[10:52:54] <CorsairX> It does rely on the user putting in a valid 24 hour time (0900 vs 900) but again, this is only as a guide so it's good enough
[10:52:59] <CorsairX> Cork: Thanks for your help again
[12:35:19] <jomofcw> the hover() method can't be used with delegation, right ? I need to detail mouseenter,mouseleave events ?
[15:52:35] <W0LF> anyone familiar with using jquery to place elements randomly>
[15:59:52] <Hiren> Hello everyone
[16:01:11] <Hiren> I facing a trouble with content load by jquery with ajax, it's loading much content on page and works fine, but when the browser tab is not active and the content is being loaded, page show blank section for few seconds and then loading the dynamic content
[16:01:56] <Hiren> Is there anyone have solution for this?
[16:39:54] <Sal> does anyone know to what event to listen to get typed char from a text input?
[16:40:14] <Sal> i was using "input", but on mobile it seems to not fire
[18:32:25] <dnscat> Hello. Is it possible to traverse upwards in the DOM using jquery? i.e. I want to grab the <table> element from the context of having a td
[18:36:16] <dnscat> Ah, I found it. .parenntsUntil()
[19:17:42] <shoky_> dnscat: usually you'd want .closest()
