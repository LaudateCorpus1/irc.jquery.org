[07:34:31] <herol3oy> hi. how can i get the author in DOM, too? https://codepen.io/malavender/pen/qdvMyO
[09:02:02] <Cork> herme5: what author are you refering to?
[09:02:08] <Cork> opps
[09:02:18] <Cork> ah, he left...
[12:58:20] <jak2000> i have a div, that contain 20 inputs, i want extract the value and data-id  property? how to do for each? thanks
[13:49:18] <snackoverflow> Say on a target website I have element $('#el'). $el has no onclick attribute in the html; instead, $('#el').on('click', function(){}) is defined in the javascript. how can i find where in the javascript $('#el')'s onclick is defined (on a site that is not mine) using console/developer tools?
[14:05:28] <shoky_> snackoverflow: searching through the code is usually quickest :p  you can also use the devtools to list the event handlers registered on the element, but that will lead you to jquery internals code. if you debug and step through the code though you'll eventually hit the relevant handler function you want
[14:07:18] <shoky_> that's assuming the event handler was really added to that specific element, and not delegated to an ancestor element's event handler
[14:54:08] <Exuma> im writing a script which will be loaded onto other peoples websites, how can i load jquery into the document but call it my own thing, so that i can be sure that if jquery is loaded (before or after) my script, into the main document, it wont conflict
[14:54:18] <Exuma> basically i want my own hyper isolated "version" of jquery that i can call xxx or something
[14:54:31] <Exuma> and reference it directly by that, and $ and jQuery of parent window wont conflict
[15:59:58] <snackoverflow> shoky: w...what?
[16:00:03] <snackoverflow> oh
[16:00:19] <snackoverflow> shoky: can you give an example?
[18:19:12] <shoky> snackoverflow: an example of what?
[19:04:22] <snackoverflow> shoky: an implementation of what I want
[19:27:15] <snackoverflow> can anyone help? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58896469/how-can-i-find-the-javascript-events-associated-with-an-html-button
[19:51:25] <shoky> snackoverflow: an "implementation" of looking for something manually and finding it..?
[19:52:53] <shoky> did you find the event handlers pane in devtools?
[19:58:06] <jak2000> any advice: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/pktc0zLr/9/       e is not iterable        when user press Button any advice why?
[20:12:49] <shoky> jak2000: log the values you are getting.. they are undefined.  $('xnoemb')  looks for <xnoemb> element
[20:13:09] <shoky> jak2000: and,  document.querySelector returns a single element, not a list. so e is not iterable. just read the error message ;)
[20:18:31] <jak2000> shoky: corrected: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/pktc0zLr/12/    i use now:  querySelectorAll     but now how to get the value of each input ?
[20:19:19] <shoky> jak2000: with the value property ?
[20:19:39] <shoky> why are you mixing jquery and raw-DOM :\
[20:19:50] <shoky> don't do that
[20:20:08] <jak2000> done
[20:20:21] <jak2000> exaplin me mmore, how to fix?
[20:20:34] <shoky> document.querySelectorAll is raw DOM
[20:20:36] <jak2000> pls
[20:20:38] <shoky> $(...) is jquery
[20:21:06] <jak2000> ok, remove querySelectorAll  and how to do foreach?
[20:21:07] <shoky> jquery objects and DOM elements do not have the same properties/methods, it just causes confusion as you are experiencing.
[20:21:19] <shoky> .each() ?
[20:21:38] <shoky> or probably can do it same as you are doing it now
[20:22:36] <jak2000> ich is the equivalence: of querySelectorAll  with jquery?
[20:22:58] <shoky> no, it's the equivalent of for (...) { }
[20:23:09] <shoky> i already told you what the equivalent of querySelectorAll is ;)
[20:23:56] <shoky> and ... you have been using jquery for long enough that you should know this stuff in your sleep :\\\\
[20:24:06] <shoky> why do you have such a hard time with this
[20:24:18] <jak2000> ok, understand
[20:24:20] <shoky> every day asking the same beginner questions
[20:24:24] <shoky> for months and months
[20:25:19] <shoky> these are questions for day #1 of jquery, seriously
[20:25:53] <shoky> not trying to be mean.. just.. you have to change something
[20:26:28] <jak2000> understand man...
[20:26:51] <jak2000> shoky then, you recommend me, first not ask any question?
[20:27:09] <shoky> might be a good idea, i don't really know
[20:27:30] <shoky> try answering the questions on your own
[20:28:31] <shoky> ERROR: e is not iterable. --> "hmm i wonder why it's saying that, let's see what e is"  -->  console.log(e) -->   "oh e is an <input> element.  is that iterable? hmm i guess not" -->  ....
[20:29:09] <shoky> doesn't take much more than this simple process, for most questions
[20:36:22] <jak2000> ok understand thanks
[20:37:11] <jak2000> exist other channel for ask
[20:37:23] <jak2000> thanks really and am sorry for bother
[20:45:37] <snackoverflow> shoky: nvm i found it.
