[01:57:01] <SirLagz> if I'm passing a Sharepoint ajax post function to $.when, does it recognise that it's a deferred ?
[01:58:17] <Cork> SirLagz: that would depend on if that function returns the xhr object/a deferred object
[01:58:26] <Cork> locate the function and check
[01:58:38] <SirLagz> Cork: thanks, will check
[02:00:23] <SirLagz> Cork: doesn't seem like it does...guess it won't allow me to do what I want then
[03:25:12] <boner> how do you add an event, if it doesn't already exist?
[03:25:26] <boner> http://jsfiddle.net/pkgconfig/o8mf0d7e/
[03:25:30] <Cork> you can't
[03:25:34] <boner> for example, both of those events fire
[03:25:45] <Cork> you can remove the old events and add them again
[03:25:59] <Cork> but if you need to check if it exists indicates you add them dynamically
[03:26:09] <Cork> and should change how you write the code instead
[03:26:19] <Cork> also... quote the attribute values >_<
[03:26:24] <Cork> it isn't the 90's anymore
[03:26:51] <xec> you don't have to quote attributes in html5
[03:26:56] * xec is a rebel
[03:27:06] <Cork> the spec is backwards compatible
[03:27:28] <Cork> but it has been good practice for ages to always do it
[03:27:37] <Cork> else you get random ugly bugs
[03:28:31] <xec> you also don't have to close a <li> or <p>
[03:28:37] * xec throws gasoline on the fire
[03:28:58] <Cork> ya, sure you can write tag soup and let the error corrector handle things
[03:29:07] <xec> it's not an error ;)
[03:29:10] <Cork> you don't need to use <!doctype> <html> or <body> either
[03:29:23] <Cork> xec: it is in how the browser looks at it
[03:29:42] <Cork> you have the straight parser and the error recovery code path
[03:29:52] <xec> you do need the doctype if you want html5
[03:30:04] <xec> but yes, <html> and <body> is optional
[03:30:22] <xec> i wouldn't recommend it though ;)
[03:31:07] <xec> if the browser sees valid html as errors, that really is a bug in the browser then
[03:31:11] <Cork> xec: btw no <p><li></p> isn't valid modern html
[03:31:17] <Cork> (it isn't html5)
[03:31:24] <Cork> it is valid html3 though
[03:31:49] <xec> Cork: you still need to have <li> inside a list container, but you can do <p><ul><li></ul> and it's valid
[03:32:05] <Cork> i'm quite sure that isn't allowed
[03:32:17] <xec> how sure, on a scale? :D
[03:33:18] <Cork> sure enough that i'm testing it
[03:34:08] <xec> Cork: <title> is the only required tag in html5 iirc
[03:34:28] <xec> Cork: so the following validates fine: <!doctype html><title>required!</title><p>some paragraph<ul><li>some list item</ul>
[03:34:37] <Cork> yikes...
[03:34:39] <Cork> "An li element's end tag can be omitted if the li element is immediately followed by another li element or if there is no more content in the parent element."
[03:34:44] <Cork> that is just plain sad
[03:35:07] <xec> I found it's great for when you don't want spaces between inline-blocks
[03:35:14] <Cork> that just proves how broken the html standard is
[03:35:17] <xec> which is a real nuisance
[03:35:36] <Cork> xec: <!-- --> is a cleaner solution for that
[03:35:49] <xec> not really
[03:35:50] <Cork> i still consider <li>something<li> bad format
[03:36:11] <xec> that's just you though ;) me, the spec, the validator and the browser is all fine with it
[03:36:12] <Cork> also the css spec is working on a property to solve that completely
[03:36:38] <xec> yeah, which will be gloabally available in the year what
[03:36:39] <Cork> xec: ya, i know i look much more strictly on html then the "write what ever crap you want we deal with it somehow"
[03:36:59] <xec> it's not "deal with it somehow", it is explicitly part of the spec
[03:37:02] <Cork> css is moving much faster lately
[03:37:24] <Cork> ya, it is part of the spec that you are allowed to do it
[03:37:34] <Cork> but the fact are still the browser have to deal with it somehow
[03:37:40] <xec> loosen up, go with the flow, we're not part of nazi xhtml days anymore, these are hippie html5 days!
[03:37:46] <Cork> just cause a spec says it is ok doesn't mean it is something you can support cleanly
[03:37:58] <Cork> xec: html5 is a marketing term, not a standard
[03:38:09] <Cork> if you want to talk about html stop refering to html5
[03:38:38] <Cork> cause html5 means css3 animations, svg, es6, h264...
[03:38:40] <xec> Cork: strawman argument!
[03:38:50] <Cork> not the html spec
[03:39:01] <xec> name of the spec doesn't really change anything does it ;)
[03:39:07] <Cork> it does
[03:39:25] <xec> ok when I say html5 i mean *HTML 5* not css+++
[03:39:28] <Cork> appears you just want to waste time
[03:39:37] <Cork> and i don't have the time to do that
[03:40:20] <xec> it's really not constructive to call out people on errors that aren't errors, especially in public help channels
[03:40:59] <xec> we should try to get people to understand what's really important. quoting attribute values and closing <li>s etc isn't
[03:42:00] <Cork> xec: wow.. not sure what your on today... but you should take it easy on the tripping...
[03:42:34] <Cork> helping ppl avoiding pitfalls IS one of the main reasons for helping in this channel
[03:43:06] <xec> that's true
[03:43:38] <Cork> and just cause really old html allowed it, so new standards have to allow it
[03:43:47] <Cork> means it is something anyone should actively do
[03:43:55] <Cork> document.write is a good js example of that
[03:57:37] <boner> Cork, how do you delete the events?
[03:57:49] <Cork> boner: .off
[03:58:08] <boner> I want to delete all events, so just ..  $('#test').off('click'); then?
[03:58:18] <Cork> boner: but like i said, you should look at why you need to do this, and fix that instead
[03:58:20] <Cork> boner: yes
[03:58:33] <boner> i'm detaching and reattaching and need to add the event on, if it doesn't exist
[03:59:00] <Cork> boner: if it is already in the dom wouldn't that mean it always have the listener?
[03:59:11] <Cork> boner: also you could delegate the event handler to a static parent
[04:25:09] <boner> the dynamic params have to update with each new tab, so i found it easier just to off/recreate
[05:33:00] <naftilos76> Hi everyone, i want to execute a function on the succesfull submission of an ajax form. Supposing that i have the form object saved in 'form' , what can i do to setup a callback?
[05:41:56] <naftilos76> I have setup a form with .on( 'ajax:complete', function(){} ); The callback is fired just fine but not in the case of 'ajax:success' . I confirm that the response from the server is 200. Can anyone guess what is wrong?
[05:42:39] <Birliban> Hi, how to select an option in a dropdown not using $(#selectitem).val("foo") but data(). So I want to have the option selected where $("oneoption").data("foo")==2 ?
[05:46:28] <xec> Birliban: something like this? $(".myOption:selected).data("foo")
[05:46:37] <xec> missing a " but you get the point
[05:46:53] <xec> https://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[05:46:57] <Birliban> i'll try and get back
[05:50:09] <xec> naftilos76: what is an "ajax form"?
[05:55:50] <naftilos76> xec: please read here: http://www.seguetech.com/blog/2013/03/12/what-is-ajax-and-where-is-it-used-in-technology
[05:58:59] <Birliban> xec: hmm, cant get it like this I think. I just made you a short fiddle with comments to explain better ;-) https://jsfiddle.net/LbLhpkz2/
[06:09:09] <Guest30_> http://jsfiddle.net/03gvpxmq/ What casues the issue
[06:09:13] <Guest30_> When you  click one
[06:09:20] <Guest30_> that it flips down?
[06:09:47] <Guest30_> It does what it need to do but the elements below should jus 'slide down' like the others
[06:17:09] <Cork> Guest30_: padding is removed on the element when jquery animates it (needed for the element to animate correctly)
[06:17:28] <Cork> Guest30_: simplest solution is to just add another element inside it and have margin on it in stead
[06:24:47] <Guest30_> oh
[06:25:00] <Guest30_> margin bottom then?
[06:27:55] <Guest30_> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/03gvpxmq/1/
[06:28:44] <xec> naftilos76: i know what ajax is, but not what you mean by "ajax form", i was thinking maybe it was some plugin you're using?
[06:33:05] <Guest30_> Error better visual this way: http://jsfiddle.net/03gvpxmq/2/
[06:33:15] <Guest30_> I tried adding a margin bottom but it's not doing exactly what I want :P
[06:34:01] <xec> Birliban: https://jsfiddle.net/LbLhpkz2/1/
[06:37:41] <Birliban> xec: Great!!! Thank you a lot!
[06:37:59] <Birliban> Must the bar var be outside the event function?
[06:38:58] <Cork> Guest30_: http://jsfiddle.net/03gvpxmq/3/
[06:39:22] <Cork> Guest30_: so the error was that the content overflow the parent, not the padding
[06:50:16] <naftilos76> xec, i am using a simple html form and i submit it via ajax. No plugins. I use jquery to get the form element and .on('ajax:success', function(){}); to get the callback when server responds with a 200 status. However on('ajax:success', function(){}); does not work but strangly ajax:complete does. The response is alway 200. I am not sure what is wrong.
[06:52:56] <mads_> Hello. i'm having some jquery code that is triggered by $("#some-id").click(function() { "My Code" }) - Is it possible to easily make "My Code" run both on click and when the site loads?
[06:56:52] <hlve> not sure if this question is going to come out clear... basically I'm trying to auto-generate a 128-bit AES key (completely random), and I'm not entirely sure if I'm doing the math right in jQ ;).
[06:56:52] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/bb3pyq9m/1/
[06:57:16] <hlve> mads_, create a function and call that function in both the click, and on ready.
[06:57:33] <hlve> I'd suggest creating a jsfiddle (jsfiddle.net) with your code.
[06:58:56] <hlve> @ mads_ - Kinda like this: http://jsfiddle.net/w8b2707x/
[06:59:45] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/w8b2707x/1/  with better doc
[07:01:57] <Guest30_> ooooh
[07:02:47] <xec> naftilos76: how do you submit the form via ajax?
[07:03:37] <Guest30_> Cork Thank for the suggestion. Any ideas why the' 1st item on the second line' is  also flipping to the right?
[07:03:42] <Guest30_> http://jsfiddle.net/03gvpxmq/3/  >
[07:04:18] <Cork> float: left
[07:04:18] <xec> mads_: ugly hack? you can do $("#some-id").click(function() { "My Code" }).click();
[07:04:36] <Cork> Guest30_: floats try to stack on rows not vertically
[07:04:45] * hlve slaps Cork around a bit with a large trout!
[07:04:49] <hlve> any suggestions for me, bby.
[07:04:50] <Cork> <_<
[07:04:54] <xec> mads_: what will trigger the click after registering it, but might have unwanted side effects (if you have more handlers registered for instance)
[07:04:58] <hlve> AES encryption is boring.
[07:05:20] <hlve> basically I'm trying to auto-generate a 128-bit AES key (completely random), and I'm not entirely sure if I'm doing the math right in jQ ;).
[07:05:20] <hlve>  http://jsfiddle.net/bb3pyq9m/1/
[07:05:23] <xec> mads_: better to just create a separate function that you use in the handler, and also call that on page load
[07:05:34] <hlve> (128 or 256)
[07:05:39] <xec> s/what/that
[07:05:39] <b-ot> Correction, <xec> mads_: that will trigger the click after registering it, but might have unwanted side effects (if you have more handlers registered for instance)
[07:05:49] <naftilos76> xec, i use rails helpers. The html code is this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d2a718a706a21eb48a84
[07:06:03] <hlve> ;/
[07:06:14] <mads_> xec: Thanks for respons, i used hlve's example which was a great help and works for me as i want it to
[07:06:25] <hlve> :)
[07:06:27] <mads_> hlve: Thanks a lot for the example :) i'm all new to this jquery :)
[07:06:46] <xec> oh i didnt notice hlve already answered :)
[07:06:50] <hlve> Yw. I'm pretty *new* too. but I know my way around ;p
[07:06:58] <hlve> Xec, you can help me next, that'll be fun!
[07:06:59] <hlve> :P
[07:07:04] <naftilos76> xec, do you see anything strange?
[07:07:21] <Guest30_> Bah
[07:07:34] <xec> naftilos76: looks like a normal html form? what is rails helpers?
[07:07:35] <Guest30_> Should I clear them ?
[07:08:07] <xec> naftilos76: sorry for the stupid questions, but i think we actually might be getting somewhere
[07:08:26] <hlve> there are no stupid questions.
[07:08:43] <hlve> ;_;
[07:08:48] <xec> only stupid people?
[07:08:52] <hlve> :P
[07:08:54] <xec> :D
[07:09:00] <Amanej> Hello
[07:09:06] <Guest30_> Cork  You are right without the flow it works but then my col. structure is lown
[07:09:08] <Guest30_> blown
[07:09:23] <Amanej> I am trying to use the jquery ui picker. How do you output the selected date in the actual date input field ?
[07:09:43] <Cork> Guest30_: ya, you could try using the column css property
[07:09:46] <naftilos76> xec, i am on ruby on rails 4.2 and rails uses the so called rails helpers which help you write less code. The interpreter interprets the ruby code into html and the result is returned to the browser with the response
[07:10:11] <hlve> Could point me to some scripts that will help generate 128-bit/256-bit AES passphrases randomly...?
[07:10:14] <hlve> ;____________;
[07:10:17] <Cork> though it is very new so not all browsers support it, and if i remember correctly chromes implementation is buggy
[07:10:35] <Guest30_> Indeed I tried that a while ago on an other example
[07:10:39] <Guest30_> Oh btw let's rename my name:
[07:10:47] <xec> naftilos76: ok so the rails helpers basically help generate html -- and i guess some javascript too?
[07:10:48] <Duikb00t> That's better.
[07:11:07] <Cork> Duikb00t: there are tiling plugins you could have a look at, it might solve the problem for you
[07:11:22] <Duikb00t> http://jsfiddle.net/03gvpxmq/4/  This is already doing it almost
[07:11:32] <Cork> ?g masonry.js
[07:11:35] <Duikb00t> Now also slides up the previous item when you click a new one )
[07:11:39] <hlve> ugh :s
[07:11:42] <Duikb00t> .g masonry.js
[07:11:57] <Cork> Duikb00t: http://masonry.desandro.com/
[07:12:05] <Duikb00t> yes already there :P
[07:12:13] <Duikb00t> You use masonry for columsn?
[07:12:24] <naftilos76> xec, in some cases yes but not in this one. I manually do that which worked yesterday but after a few changes it does not any more.
[07:12:38] <Duikb00t> I mean not for setting up large grids? But also for smaller parts? I only used it for large image gallerys etc.
[07:12:49] <Cork> Duikb00t: haven't used it much but ya it can give you a column like structure
[07:12:53] <Amanej> Anyone could help me out ?
[07:12:57] <xec> naftilos76: ok so what does your js look like?
[07:14:04] <xec> Amanej: iirc the value of the input field should get updated when you click a date, is that not the case?
[07:15:22] <Duikb00t> Hmmthere must a css-only way too :D
[07:15:54] <naftilos76> xec, i confirm through the console that the form is found and then i do : form.on('ajax:success', function(){ console.log("success"); }); It is really complicated to show you all the code.
[07:16:30] <naftilos76> xec, as i said, it works for ajax:complete but not for ajax:success
[07:16:55] <naftilos76> xec, and that is strange when the server respnds with a 200 status
[07:17:19] <Cork> naftilos76: the response might fail to parse
[07:17:37] <Cork> or you might have code error in the code handling the callbacks
[07:17:52] <Cork> both will result in the error/fail callback  to fire instead of success
[07:18:17] <naftilos76> Cork, that is why i am just using a console.log(); to just show a message in the log.
[07:18:20] <Amanej> xec: no, I have the jquery ui date picker attached to a date input field
[07:18:25] <Amanej> but it doesnt update itself
[07:18:35] <Amanej> I am looking at the api documentation now
[07:18:44] <naftilos76> Cork, how can i know if the response fails to parse?
[07:18:49] <Amanej> But cant figure out what I should use/do
[07:20:30] <Cork> naftilos76: bind a .fail callback on the ajax call
[07:20:37] <Cork> and check the third arguments
[07:20:38] <Cork> -s
[07:21:00] <Cork> it will tell you why the fail callback was called
[07:21:20] <hlve> cork.
[07:21:21] <hlve> anything?
[07:21:24] <xec> Amanej: if i check the demo at https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ it seems to work, i can inspect the input field, and its value property gets updated when I select a value.
[07:21:32] <hlve> or are you not sure.
[07:22:27] <naftilos76> Cork, i setup callbacks on success, failure and complete and only the complete fires
[07:22:37] <Amanej> xec: ahh, because its a text input field
[07:22:40] <Amanej> Thanks though
[07:22:44] <Amanej> that solved it
[07:22:57] <xec> Amanej: aha :D
[07:23:03] <Cork> naftilos76: by callback you mean event handlers?
[07:23:12] <Kartagis> why does line #3 of http://paste.debian.net/317413/ give me Unexpected identifier?
[07:23:13] <Cork> try with real callbacks instead
[07:23:44] <xec> naftilos76: are you using $.ajax() to make the http request?
[07:24:26] <naftilos76> xec, i am using the form that you saw, not jquery's $.ajax
[07:24:47] <naftilos76> Cork, yes event handlers, sorry
[07:25:00] <Cork> so again, try with real ajax callbacks
[07:25:01] <xec> naftilos76: so how is the ajax request made?
[07:25:50] <xec> Kartagis: getPictures is a method, and you're passing.. what exactly... to it?
[07:26:18] <Kartagis> oh, I need to pass a function
[07:26:34] <xec> maybe, i have no idea what getPictures is...
[07:26:52] <Kartagis> xec: it's from a cordova plugin
[07:27:07] <Kartagis> https://github.com/wymsee/cordova-imagePicker
[07:27:53] <xec> right, looks like it takes two function callbacks (and optional options object)
[07:27:58] <xec> *afk*
[07:30:44] <hlve> ;[
[07:41:31] <MatthewWilkes> Hi all, I'm trying to debug a problem with the interaction of a bunch of different components. I think the smallest issue is that $(window).height() and window.innerHeight are radically different, but I don't understand the difference between them. Removing large amounts of page content makes them agree, does $(window).height take into account the content of the document?
[07:43:03] <MatthewWilkes> window.innerHeight reports 597, $(window).height() reports 2092
[07:44:36] <MatthewWilkes> Using a screen measuring programme, I get 597 as the height of the window, I'm confused as to where 2092 could be coming from
[07:46:50] <Cork> MatthewWilkes: $(window).height() is the same as docuemtn.documentElement.clientHeight
[07:46:58] <Cork> 'document
[07:47:27] <MatthewWilkes> Yup, that's 2092
[07:47:34] <MatthewWilkes> Okay, thanks
[07:47:37] <Cork> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.height
[07:47:48] <Cork> the if (jQuery.isWindow(elem)) section
[07:47:53] <MatthewWilkes> Well that implies it's a browser thing, rather than jQuery itself
[07:48:07] <Cork> not really
[07:48:19] <Cork> clientHeight of the document is meant to be the full page height
[07:48:34] <Cork> not sure why jquery forces window height to be that
[07:48:42] <MatthewWilkes> A-ha!
[07:49:02] <MatthewWilkes> Apparently documentElement.clientHeight can be wrong if you have a broken doctype declaration
[07:49:09] <Cork> but ya document and window height/width is a bit inconsistent and weird
[07:49:18] <MatthewWilkes> Yup, that fixes it
[07:49:34] <MatthewWilkes> Thanks for the pointer, Cork. I thought I was going mad.
[07:49:39] <Cork> np
[07:55:09] <WhereIsMySpoon> Why, for exactly the same element, does .is(":visible") return false but .css("visibility") returns "visible"?
[07:55:13] <WhereIsMySpoon> :S
[07:55:29] <Cork> WhereIsMySpoon: cause :visible doesn't just check visibility
[07:55:41] <Cork> it also checks height != 0 width != 0 display != none
[07:56:10] <WhereIsMySpoon> Cork: alright, so what does .css("visibility") actually..mean?
[07:56:12] <Cork> (and opacity if i remember correctly)
[07:56:30] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility
[07:56:48] <WhereIsMySpoon> ah I see...so its a very specific meaning
[07:56:55] <Cork> yes, it is raw css
[07:57:03] <WhereIsMySpoon> ok that makes a lot more sense
[07:57:13] <WhereIsMySpoon> thank you for the useful, concise and quick answers :)
[07:57:26] <rogger_h> hey guys
[07:58:04] <rogger_h> jQuery("body").on("click","#co-payment-form input",function(){ alert(1) } ); but the alert is not excuting on click , i verified its exsit , ideas?
[08:00:01] <Cork> rogger_h: and $('body').find('#co-payment-form input').length > 0 ?
[08:00:16] <Cork> rogger_h: also when you want to bind an event handler for the entire document bind it on document not 'body'
[08:00:30] <Cork> it makes it follow the structure jquery uses it self
[08:00:40] <Cork> (some of its events only exist on document)
[08:00:48] <Kartagis> I need to hire someone with phonegap knowledge. anyone available?
[08:02:15] <Cork> Kartagis: off topic
[08:02:20] <Cork> Kartagis: try in #freelance
[08:03:35] <Kartagis> thanks Cork, didn't even know that's a thing
[08:27:16] <rogger_h> so &document) basicly
[08:27:24] <rogger_h> jQuery(document)
[08:28:15] <rogger_h> $('body').find('#co-payment-form input') this gives me 0 since when page is loaded the element is not present , thats why i was putting the body event "live"
[08:28:19] <rogger_h> .on <
[08:28:32] <rogger_h> but i just wonder why its not working at all
[08:30:08] <taplar> rogger_h: could you reask your question?  do you have a related fiddle?
[08:32:11] <shoky> rogger_h: is your script in the <head> section and without a  $(document).ready  ?
[08:32:43] <shoky> cause then it wouldn't even find $('body')
[08:40:18] <Cork> rogger_h: by $('body').find('#co-payment-form input') i meant run that when things has loaded
[08:40:40] <Cork> it was meant to validate that the target you are looking for is actually matched by the selector
[08:41:33] <Cork> the comment about 'body' vs document is just a side tip so you don't end up with problems with some of the global events jquery only fires on document
[08:41:44] <Cork> but in your case both should work as long as the selector is correct
[08:42:13] <Cork> shoky: actually body always exist
[08:42:57] <Cork> head body and title is the only three things you can always count on existing
[08:43:11] <Cork> (for the dom that is)
[08:43:59] <notchris> Morning all
[08:44:26] <shoky> Cork: then what's this http://jsbin.com/kobodubija/1/edit?html,output
[08:44:47] <Cork> an empty jsbin
[08:45:02] <shoky> js is in the html
[08:45:31] <Cork> <meta charset="utf-8"> <title>JS Bin</title> is the only content except for the standard tags
[08:45:48] <Cork> ^ reason why i don't use jsbin it loses content all the freaking time
[08:46:39] <Cork> hmm
[08:46:45] <Cork> shoky: actually you are correct
[08:46:52] <Cork> .body exists, but it is null :/
[08:47:04] <Cork> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/v30yowa2/
[08:47:06] <shoky> ya http://jsfiddle.net/0mhfkxq4/
[08:47:42] <shoky> i admit this surprised me too ;p
[08:47:54] <Cork> when i saw it, i remembered it was like that
[08:48:11] <Cork> i seam to forget all the dom0 compatibility hacks needed...
[08:48:22] <Cork> and remember how it is implemented in the browser instead :/
[08:48:33] <shoky> he
[08:48:34] <shoky> h
[09:01:34] <yottabyte> if you have inline styles for an html element as style="display: none", and you try to do $("#myelement").show() it appears not to work
[09:01:52] <Cork> yottabyte: it should
[09:02:47] <Cork> yottabyte: http://jsfiddle.net/nt0v04d8/
[09:03:29] <yottabyte> why isn't it working for me in my page
[09:03:35] <yottabyte> I mean it's working here in the jsfiddle
[09:03:51] <taplar> make sure your selector is matching an element
[09:04:14] <Cork> and make sure it really is the inline display: none; not getting removed
[09:04:33] <Cork> so you don't have something like display: none !important in a css selector
[09:05:14] <yottabyte> yeah I have it in the dom explorer, <span id="startBetweenSpan" style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px;">Starting</span>
[09:05:19] <yottabyte> it's not changing
[09:05:25] <yottabyte> actually
[09:05:33] <yottabyte> yeah I have it in the dom explorer, <span id="startBetweenSpan" style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; display: none">Starting</span>
[09:05:41] <yottabyte> (I had unchecked display: none)
[09:05:53] <Cork> and your using #startBetweenSpan ?
[09:05:55] <yottabyte> but yeah when I do show(); it doesn't change the display:none
[09:05:58] <yottabyte> yeah
[09:06:10] <Cork> and $('[id="startBetweenSpan"]').length == 1
[09:06:13] <yottabyte> the .length shows 1
[09:06:24] <Cork> #startBetweenSpan can ever only be 1
[09:06:27] <Cork> well or 0
[09:06:44] <Cork> the selector i gave you was to make sure you don't have duplicate ids
[09:06:55] <yottabyte> that gave true
[09:06:59] <Cork> hmm
[09:07:22] <Cork> and the dom inspector actually updates the attribute dynamically?
[09:07:26] <Cork> some don't
[09:07:32] <yottabyte> yeah
[09:07:33] <Cork> (check the css rule section instead)
[09:07:38] <yottabyte> now show() and hide() are working ¬¬
[09:07:43] <yottabyte> idk what's going on with internet explorer
[09:07:45] <yottabyte> hahahaha
[09:08:04] <Cork> well setting display: none manually is normally a bad idea anyway
[09:08:19] <Cork> cause .show() expects you to hide them with .hide() for things to work correctly
[09:08:20] <yottabyte> should I put it in the CSS
[09:08:24] <Cork> no
[09:08:29] <Cork> on page load you should run .hide()
[09:08:37] <Cork> it is how those are meant to work
[09:08:50] <Cork> yottabyte: alternatively you could use .toggleClass
[09:09:09] <Cork> i tend to do that, makes things cleaner (a readable class instead of inline css)
[09:09:18] <Cork> and i didn't mean a hidden class :)
[09:11:18] <yottabyte> it's not working again
[09:11:21] <yottabyte> this is so complicated
[09:11:42] <Cork> and your sure the code section is actually executed?
[09:11:52] <yottabyte> well I'm doing it in the console right now
[09:11:54] <Cork> cause this shouldn't behave like this
[09:12:17] <Cork> might be $ isn't jquery
[09:12:17] <yottabyte> I don't want to make it appear by default and then hide it on page load, because I only want to display it in one circumstance
[09:12:24] <yottabyte> it is
[09:12:26] <Cork> try jQuery() instead
[09:12:48] <yottabyte> I get jquery objects when I do hide(), show(), etc
[09:12:49] <Cork> yottabyte: well you could always use .css('display', '')
[09:13:10] <Cork> to bypass all the hide/show logic
[09:13:23] <Cork> i would still recommend the class solution though ;P
[09:13:50] <yottabyte> the toggleClass?
[09:13:55] <yottabyte> or adding a class for display: none?
[09:14:03] <Cork> addClass/removeClass/toggleClass
[09:14:13] <Cork> a class for the state you want to change to
[09:14:20] <yottabyte> and that class will just be display: none;?
[09:14:27] <Cork> like i said have a class explaining the state the element move into
[09:14:32] <Cork> instead of just hidden or visible
[09:15:27] <Cork> yottabyte: i mean something like #startBetweenSpan { display: none; } #startBetweenSpan.expanded { display: block; }
[09:15:48] <Cork> yottabyte: or something like #startBetweenSpan { display: none; } .overlay #startBetweenSpan { display: block; }
[09:16:02] <Cork> that is usually how i structure show/hide
[09:16:09] <Cork> cause it makes the code and html more readable
[09:16:28] <Cork> (sure it means you have to carry a few extra selectors, but not enough that it matters)
[09:17:21] <yottabyte> so confusing
[09:17:29] <yottabyte> what does the . mean in the css?
[09:17:35] <Cork> class selector
[09:17:48] <yottabyte> so #start.expanded is what?
[09:17:58] <yottabyte> and .overlay #startBetweenSpan?
[09:18:10] <Cork> sounds like you should read up on basic css selectors
[09:18:34] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors
[09:19:09] <Cork> cause you area going to need to know css selectors if you ever want to be serious about web development
[09:19:30] <Cork> and jquery requires it quite heavily too
[09:19:45] <yottabyte> so is it like an element that has class overlay and id startBetweenSpan?
[09:20:05] <Cork> the overlay is a parent selector
[09:20:25] <Cork> so it selects #startBetweenSpan if a parent element has the class overlay
[09:20:30] <Cork> (it was just examples of selectors)
[09:22:58] <Cork> yottabyte: http://jsfiddle.net/4eng41do/
[09:24:31] <dave1984> If I want to loop through an array of objects (~100 or so) and check the value of a specific attribute and count how many times a value exists (e.g. red: 4, blue: 503, green: 20), is there a function that can help with that?
[09:25:02] <dave1984> else I can just manually do it
[09:25:08] <Cork> dave1984: by attribute you mean something like <div data-red="20> ?
[09:25:20] <Cork> or are you talking about arrays of objects?
[09:25:20] <dave1984> property of an object sorry
[09:25:24] <Cork> ok
[09:25:31] <Cork> then no
[09:25:39] <Cork> $.each is the only help you have
[09:26:04] <taplar> could grep and get length
[09:26:13] <dave1984> Cork: I'll elaborate but I think you know what I'm saying already. Imagine 100 Person objects each with an age. And I want to count how many times an age occurs and map that to a graph
[09:26:22] <Cork> ya, but if you want multiple values a single loop is much better
[09:26:51] <Cork> dave1984: if you just want one value $.grep is a good choice
[09:27:03] <Cork> but it will create a new array so you will produce quite a bit of gc
[09:27:22] <Cork> so if you want to check for multiple values it is better to just create an object before and $.each loop
[09:27:23] <dave1984> Cork: wasn't what I was going for but I may use that later on, thanks
[09:27:30] <Cork> and then result.red++ in the loop
[09:27:31] <hellyeah> as far as i remember this should work https://jsfiddle.net/ofbnrefm/3/ why it didnt work
[09:27:52] <dave1984> Cork: yeah, I'm not looking for a specific set of values right now,it should be dynamic
[09:28:01] <taplar> hellyeah: not an id
[09:28:04] <dave1984> so if a new color were added it would still satisfy that use case
[09:28:30] <Cork> dave1984: you you could make that dynamic too
[09:28:35] <hellyeah> damn i am confused again
[09:28:47] <Cork> hellyeah: class="" != #
[09:28:56] <taplar> 'tag', '.class', '#id'
[09:29:34] <Cork> dave1984: you could do something like result[key+value]=result[key+value]||0;result[key+value]++
[09:29:47] <Cork> the extent you do it is really up to you
[09:29:57] <Cork> but it would be my recommendation
[09:31:30] <hellyeah> Cork: everytime i am confused
[09:31:46] <Cork> hellyeah: read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors
[09:32:09] <Cork> you need to get a better understanding on what the different selectors are
[09:32:42] <hellyeah> actually i know those but each time i am confused. Nevertheless i will read that thanks
[09:32:50] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/Laj7thrk/ why am I getting undefined?
[09:33:35] <Cork> Kartagis: what you get isn't an array
[09:33:46] <Cork> so your looking key, values (and those values are strings)
[09:35:46] <Kartagis> so it's an object
[09:35:50] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/Laj7thrk/1/
[09:38:00] <dave1984> Cork: haha here I was in another tab and that's exactly what I came up with
[09:42:05] <Kartagis> how can I get all video values from here?
[09:42:13] <Kartagis> I'm clueless
[09:42:21] <Cork> in your example there is only one video in the result
[09:43:04] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/ofbnrefm/14/ when you click button you will get Prod_buttonClick how can i change it as querystringlike ?Prod=buttonClick and pass it to end of URL? is there a way?
[09:44:09] <Cork> why would you store a query string in a name??
[09:44:29] <Cork> buttonClick would be the value of the button
[09:44:35] <Cork> not the name
[09:45:15] <dave1984> Cork: something like:  tally[ objects[1].color ] ? tally[ objects[1].color ]++ : 1;
[09:45:24] <hellyeah> i didnt hide querystring in a name
[09:45:26] <dave1984> 1 being the current index of the loop
[09:45:32] <Kartagis> hrm, that's impossible, the user has 8 videos
[09:45:35] <hellyeah> i just hide like name: Prod_buttonClick
[09:45:36] <Kartagis> strange
[09:45:56] <hellyeah> when you click the button i want to pass it to url like ?Prod=buttonClick
[09:46:23] <Cork> hellyeah: ya, that is the same thing
[09:46:46] <hellyeah> i dont understand how is it same?
[09:47:25] <hellyeah> okey i can split the Prod_buttonClick split('_')
[09:47:37] <hellyeah> i have Prod and buttonClick in different index
[09:47:53] <hellyeah> then i can combine it as a querystring
[09:47:59] <hellyeah> what about pass it to url
[09:48:07] <hellyeah> dont have any clue
[09:48:28] <muranjan> How can I copy google map from div ( created using google map javascript api ) and send it on mail?? is there anyone have worked on google map API???
[09:50:19] <hellyeah> i guess it doesnt make sense
[09:50:58] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/ofbnrefm/15/
[09:51:31] <Cork> muranjan: i don't think you can do that easily
[09:51:48] <Cork> but ya, i haven't ever tried doing something like that though
[09:52:02] <decx> muranjan there's a static map api
[09:52:29] <decx> http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?sensor=false&center=lat,lon&zoom=14&size=800x600
[09:53:31] <decx> fe http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?sensor=false&center=40.7034884,-74.1197631&zoom=10&size=500x500
[09:58:32] <muranjan> thanks Cork: and decx: I will try static map..
[09:58:52] <muranjan> this requiremnt is driving me crazy and my hob at risk now :D
[09:59:44] <muranjan> I am trying ajax to post innerHtml of div which loads map and send it to php but from there when I am sending mail then it is breaking in multiple maps.. :(
[10:00:26] <decx> that's not gonna work anyway
[10:03:59] <K4T> how to add CSS styles to div without removing current ones?
[10:04:13] <K4T> .css will remove old styles from element
[10:04:37] <decx> it doesn't
[10:06:35] <STFUn00b> hi! how would i go about this? i have e.stopPropagation on some div. that div contains a elements that get injected dynamically... so i need $(document).on('click', 'a', func... for handling dynamic elements clicks. but that code doesn't execute, cuz of the e.stopPropagation.
[10:06:42] <Cork> K4T: that is actually the exact opposite of the truth
[10:07:01] <Cork> K4T: .css was added exactly to make modifying values easier
[10:07:03] <STFUn00b> is there any smart workaround for this problem, besides setting a handler directly on the element when it gets injected in the DOM?
[10:07:21] <Cork> (contra replacing the entire inline style content)
[10:07:46] <Cork> STFUn00b: never ever use stopPropagation
[10:07:52] <Cork> STFUn00b: for exactly this reason
[10:08:11] <Cork> STFUn00b: instead handlers that don't want the event from a specific sub section should filter those out
[10:08:13] <STFUn00b> i don't... it's the beauty of working with outsiders lol
[10:08:30] <STFUn00b> i'd remove it... but i'm afraid that i'll break some of his code or smth
[10:08:32] <Cork> STFUn00b: ya, so you can't use delegation if you don't remove the stopPropagation
[10:08:41] <Cork> STFUn00b: ya, it most likely will
[10:09:04] <Cork> you will have to either modify his code to work correctly, or add all the event handlers dynamically as elements are added to the page (locally on them)
[10:09:20] <Cork> cause there is no way to work around stopPropagation except removing it
[10:09:21] <STFUn00b> ok cork, thank you :)
[10:09:41] <STFUn00b> first i'm gonna whoop someone :) then back to the code hehe
[10:09:47] <Cork> :)
[10:09:58] <Cork> i often rant about not using stopPropagation
[10:10:05] <Cork> it bit me really hard a few years back
[10:10:22] <Cork> and i learnt my lesson (i had to write the site from scratch to fix it)
[10:10:48] <Cork> (and by few years i mean two digits :D )
[10:10:59] <STFUn00b> lol? that bad ha?
[10:11:00] <STFUn00b> hehe
[10:11:04] <Cork> ya it was
[10:11:12] <Cork> the site was way into development
[10:11:21] <muranjan> decx: any other solution you can suggest?
[10:11:22] <Cork> when i needed to track user activity (for auto logout)
[10:11:35] <Cork> and well lets say i sued stopPropagation heavily...
[10:12:18] <decx> muranjan just use static map
[10:31:08] <muranjan> decx: thanks I will try static map looks promising..

[11:04:45] <giuseppesolinas> hello
[11:05:00] <giuseppesolinas> how do I detect window minimize/maximise?
[11:26:38] <Cork> giuseppesolinas: you can't really do that
[11:26:51] <Cork> giuseppesolinas: the closest you can do is bind an event for resize
[11:27:04] <giuseppesolinas> Cork, thank you for the reply
[11:27:17] <Cork> (you could add requestFullscreen)
[11:27:28] <giuseppesolinas> but sometimes the resize event doesn't fire when window is maximised
[11:27:46] <giuseppesolinas> but only if it hasn't been triggered before
[11:28:02] <Cork> giuseppesolinas: sounds like a browser bug
[11:28:12] <Cork> and i can't say i've seen it
[11:28:47] <giuseppesolinas> I have, because due to refactoring I stopped triggering the resize event on dom ready
[11:28:58] <giuseppesolinas> and I noticed this issue
[11:29:31] <giuseppesolinas> it's like this on chrome, both windows and mac
[11:29:39] <giuseppesolinas> haven't tested on other browsers
[11:30:15] <Cork> i do use resize in a few places and haven't had any problem with it in either firefox and chrome
[11:30:28] <Cork> very little experience with safari
[11:30:38] <Cork> so can't say much about mac
[11:31:21] <giuseppesolinas> similar issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10180782/jquery-resize-using-browser-maximise-button
[11:54:29] <jquery639> selam
[12:25:45] <tuskkk___> ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[12:25:55] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[12:26:04] <tuskkk___> even after loading jQuery as the first thing
[12:26:11] <robertmaxrees> clear cache
[12:26:15] <robertmaxrees> check network tab.
[12:26:20] <tuskkk___> its some other plugin that uses jquery which throws the error
[12:26:21] <robertmaxrees> make sure it's actually loading.
[12:26:28] <tuskkk___> ok, let me check
[12:31:40] <tuskkk___> robertmaxrees: made sure its loading, but the error is still there :(
[12:31:54] <robertmaxrees> share the page source then?
[12:34:07] <tuskkk___> robertmaxrees: https://bpaste.net/show/d5784c2ea063
[12:34:21] <tuskkk___> its loading twice now, can that be a problem?
[12:34:21] <robertmaxrees> you're loading jquery twice.
[12:34:25] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:34:27] <robertmaxrees> load it once.
[12:34:30] <tuskkk___> one second
[12:35:52] <tuskkk___> robertmaxrees: nope, even now, same
[12:36:07] <robertmaxrees> and your network tab shows it's successfully loading?
[12:36:28] <tuskkk___> yes
[12:36:34] <robertmaxrees> then something funky is up.
[12:40:05] <tuskkk___> there are 3 reference errors, https://bpaste.net/show/2f2fea02cf28
[12:41:53] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:42:57] <tuskkk___> what I feel is, somehow those plugin js files are loading before jquery
[12:43:09] <robertmaxrees> those errors couldn't have happened from the page you linked.
[12:43:40] <robertmaxrees> did you link me the actual page source?
[12:44:23] <rkhunter> Hey folks, I have a quick question to ask. I am planning to develop a web shop using Jekyll (static site generation) therefore I'd like to ask if anyone had experience with cookies persisting along pages on static websites
[12:44:47] <robertmaxrees> rkhunter static or dynamic - doesn't really make a difference.
[12:45:12] <robertmaxrees> a static site for a webshop seems a little odd - do you plan on having an account section of some kind?
[12:45:55] <rkhunter> robertmaxrees: well, having an accounts would not be necessary due to high maintanance price and instability.
[12:46:10] <robertmaxrees> what are you using the cookies for?
[12:46:16] <rkhunter> shopping cart
[12:46:25] <rkhunter> going to be*
[12:46:27] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[12:46:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd question your thought process at that point.
[12:47:13] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could go that route, but that sounds terribly fragile.
[12:47:25] <rkhunter> In which aspects?
[12:47:44] <robertmaxrees> using jekyll to make an ecommerce site.
[12:48:07] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it's possible but i feel like you're going to create bigger headaches for yourself in the long run.
[12:48:42] <rkhunter> robertmaxrees: well, I tried different technologies already including NodeJS and PHP
[12:49:07] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:49:18] <tuskkk___> robertmaxrees: yes it is, there is an iframe inside this page which I guess is causing the errors
[12:49:22] <robertmaxrees> did you consider using something like magento or...
[12:49:37] <robertmaxrees> tuskkk___ those resources need to load inside the iframe then.
[12:49:56] <tuskkk___> how do I make that done?
[12:50:05] <robertmaxrees> tuskkk___ edit the source of the iframe.
[12:50:15] <robertmaxrees> rkhunter like, building an ecom shop from scratch is a pretty big proposition.
[12:51:25] <rkhunter> robertmaxrees: well, the market I am planning to run at requires websites to be cheap, while clients are not literate enough and don't really want to maintain by theirselfs.
[12:51:38] <robertmaxrees> then use something like magento.
[12:52:26] <robertmaxrees> trying to use a SSG to run an ecommerce site will cause you a ton of headaches in the long run.  if you want to run something small, magento or something similar is the way to go.
[12:52:47] <decx> shopify?
[12:52:52] <robertmaxrees> another good choice.
[12:54:06] <rkhunter> aren't they taking transaction fees?
[12:54:56] <robertmaxrees> https://www.magentocommerce.com/download
[12:55:28] <rkhunter> it requires to run a database instance
[12:55:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:55:52] <robertmaxrees> every ecom platform will require that.
[12:56:25] <rkhunter> robermaxrees: scriptkiddies, 500 timeouts... and DDoS probability as well as having to host an VPS
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> rkhunter i know what running an ecom site takes.
[12:56:48] <decx> if you dont want to deal with a backend then use shopify
[12:56:49] <robertmaxrees> i work at a pretty large ecom company ;)
[12:57:09] <loa> hello, can somebody explain what used for effect of those images on this site? http://artdesigner.me/
[12:57:23] <loa> they looks very flexible, and i like how they behave.
[12:57:24] <rkhunter> robertmaxrees: good for you, what is what you do (I mean front or backend etc etc)?
[12:57:33] <robertmaxrees> rkhunter a bit of everything.
[12:57:41] <loa> i am about this boxes https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25725476/screenshot-2015.10.22-19%3A57%3A29.png
[12:57:44] <robertmaxrees> i specialize in frontend, but i touch the whole stack,.
[12:57:54] <rkhunter> robertmaxrees: I have a feeling most probaby in US, right/
[12:57:57] <decx> it's just pan&zoom loa
[12:58:04] <robertmaxrees> rkhunter we did international for a while ;)
[12:58:28] <robertmaxrees> rkhunter a static site generator is entirely the wrong approach for a full ecom site.
[12:58:49] <decx> loa for artsy fartsy types also called ken burns effect
[12:59:18] <rkhunter> robertmaxrees: full is a key word. Thing is that nobody really runs at that level here.
[12:59:36] <loa> decx, i can achieve this with bootstrap 3 and jquery?
[12:59:46] <decx> you can achieve it with css
[12:59:53] <robertmaxrees> rkhunter you said you want a cart, right?
[12:59:59] <robertmaxrees> and i assume to take payments?
[13:00:07] <loa> decx, even such animation effects?
[13:00:25] <rkhunter> you will mostly see PHP websites running for something dull like post based shopping cart without Paypal or any sort of integration.
[13:00:47] <robertmaxrees> rkhunter ... i'm well aware of what lots of people do ;)
[13:01:08] <NoiseEee> is it still legit/appropriate to use mustache.js for simple JS templating when not working with a framework?
[13:01:26] <NoiseEee> or is that an answer from 2012
[13:02:08] <robertmaxrees> rkhunter do what you want, but I'm letting you know that using jekyll to make an ecom site is going to lead to big tradeoffs and huge headaches.
[13:02:22] <decx> loa: quick example http://jsfiddle.net/decx/8cL4c484/
[13:02:49] <rkhunter> robetmaxrees: thanks
[13:04:08] <loa> decx, i mean how block oganized on the page.
[13:04:13] <loa> blocks
[13:04:25] <decx> huh
[13:04:34] <loa> something like this http://codepen.io/ccrch/pen/yyaraz/
[13:05:07] <decx> a float?
[13:05:15] <loa> so they have fixed width, which changes with resolution of screen.
[13:05:33] <loa> i found one solution to place bootstrap grid in a row
[13:05:40] <loa> i will try it.
[13:06:00] <loa> decx, you often here? can i show you my success or failure?
[13:06:12] <rkhunter> Looks like everybody finds help in here. Keep it up same way folks :D
[13:06:34] <decx> i come here often
[13:06:38] <decx> ^^
[13:07:09] <loa> ok
[13:08:40] <loa> where is better ask questions about stream building and for example bootstrap?
[13:09:01] <robertmaxrees> there's a ##bootstrap
[13:09:53] <Kartagis> wait, isn't that a pickup line? :D
[13:10:13] <rkhunter> loa: stream like?
[13:10:30] <loa> rkhunter, something about gulp for example.
[13:10:35] <robertmaxrees> loa huh?
[13:10:42] <robertmaxrees> clarify, yo.
[13:10:54] <loa> i am backend developer i trying to get in frontend dev cycle...
[13:11:02] <loa> pretty hard for me.
[13:11:04] <rkhunter> loa: nodejs and bootstrap. though there are plenty of literate guys in here as well
[13:11:04] <robertmaxrees> okay, so what do you think "stream like" means?
[13:11:51] <loa> something concating -> minimizing -> uglifying tasks... some dev/production switches and so on.
[13:12:04] <robertmaxrees> traditionally you don't call that "Streaming".
[13:12:11] <robertmaxrees> that's usually apart of your dev cycle.
[13:13:09] <loa> maybe better was stream building
[13:13:15] <loa> it is from gulp site.
[13:13:39] <decx> i think the common name is build process
[13:14:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so gulp uses streams.
[13:14:28] <loa> maybe.
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:14:35] <robertmaxrees> trust me ;)
[13:14:41] <loa> there are pipes
[13:14:44] <robertmaxrees> it's a streaming build system - you're asking about build systems.
[13:14:44] <loa> many of them.
[13:15:28] <ngharo> a series of tubes and streams
[13:15:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:46:02] <Tech> hi i'm having a problem with a jquery plugin i'm using  a multiple select search box plugin for a Private Messaging System i'm working on but it's not outputting how i would like  for example the out put should be : Robin Smith, Jeff Berry i dont know why its not working can any one help me get this output fix
[13:46:28] <robertmaxrees> Tech sure, make a fiddle.
[13:57:57] <Pazician> How can I make these buttons work to slide to section to section, like data-href? http://pastebin.com/Q0n4S2R4
[13:58:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:58:55] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Yeah, I can't use data attributes, since it's appended to the sections
[13:59:09] <robertmaxrees> "How can I make these buttons work to slide to section to section,"
[13:59:12] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense.
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> try again :)
[13:59:43] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Alright, let me try again then. When you click on a button, it should slide down to the next section
[14:00:23] <Pazician> Do you understand what I'm trying to do here?
[14:00:31] <robertmaxrees> give them a unique id and use a hash in the url.
[14:00:45] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, select the new one and get the offset().top and scroll to that.
[14:01:25] <robertmaxrees> if you need more help, maybe make a fiddle.
[14:01:45] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: The thing is, I'm using WordPress, Divi theme and there's no way to get to the section to add the ID - sure it's a way, but it's way to complicated to give it time to figure it out
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:01:59] <robertmaxrees> okay,
[14:02:19] <Pazician> So I thought, if you maybe had an idea
[14:02:29] <robertmaxrees> i just gave you the way to do it.
[14:03:03] <Pazician> Hmm... The offset().top? I really don't know how to make it that way
[14:03:13] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to select the new element.
[14:03:17] <robertmaxrees> and then get the offset.
[14:03:20] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery offset
[14:03:32] <robertmaxrees> ugh, b-ot
[14:03:33] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[14:03:33] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: But there's like 7 sections to go
[14:03:46] <robertmaxrees> Pazician make a simplified fiddle and i can show you how this works.
[14:03:48] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple stuff.
[14:03:59] <Pazician> Alright, hang on
[14:07:06] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/7uvxnbmv/
[14:07:34] <robertmaxrees> er.
[14:07:40] <robertmaxrees> so is there an event handler or something here?
[14:08:06] <Pazician> Yeah, right - when the user has clicked the button it should animate down to the section
[14:08:16] <robertmaxrees> the new one?
[14:08:21] <robertmaxrees> regardless of which button was clicked?
[14:08:47] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: It the button that has the class "go"
[14:08:49] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't making sense ot me.
[14:10:01] <Pazician> Basically, I mean - when the user has clicked on the button that has the class of "go", then the whole screen should animate down to the beginning of the next section
[14:10:33] <Pazician> And I do know that I can do this with data attributes but I can't append it to each button
[14:10:36] <robertmaxrees> then grab the .index() of the current section, find the next section, and animate to it.
[14:11:15] <Pazician> Could you maybe give me a example, please?
[14:11:30] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('section') will get you the current secion that you're in.
[14:13:35] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/7uvxnbmv/3/
[14:14:08] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't animate it, and  $( index ).offset().top will just get you the current's secttion's offset.
[14:14:14] <robertmaxrees> you want the offset of the next section.
[14:14:36] <robertmaxrees> something like var currentIndex = $currentSection.index(), $nextStop = $allSections.eq(currentIndex + 1);
[14:16:06] <Pazician> Can you maybe show in the fiddle how you mean?
[14:16:13] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:16:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7uvxnbmv/4/
[14:17:00] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple.
[14:19:46] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:19:53] <Pazician> Simple when you know, hehe. I get an $allSections is not defined error?
[14:20:27] <robertmaxrees> not in the fiddle you don't
[14:21:47] <Pazician> No, but when I try it on my local site I get that - how can I fix that?
[14:21:58] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a variable declaration that i have in the fiddle.
[14:23:26] <Azrael_-> in a "$( document ).ready(function() {" i want to see how many visible rows are left in a tbody. i use this: "$('#tbodycat12 tr.artrow:visible').length"  if i evaluate this on site startup, it always returns 0 but if i call it lateron it provides the correct result. can you give me a hint why and how i can solve this?
[14:23:50] <robertmaxrees> is the document valid?
[14:23:58] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically generating those elements?
[14:24:25] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: What am I doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/7uvxnbmv/5/
[14:25:09] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:25:12] <robertmaxrees> why did oyu change it?
[14:25:28] <robertmaxrees> $nextStop = $this.closest('section').eq(currentIndex + 1);
[14:25:30] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't make any sense.
[14:26:14] <robertmaxrees> that's why I had that variable before that had all section tags selected.
[14:26:19] <robertmaxrees> need to use $('select')
[14:27:07] <Pazician> Hmm... I'll try on my own before I ask you
[14:27:29] <robertmaxrees> i literally gave you the code you need for the handler.
[14:27:34] <robertmaxrees> why mysteriously change it?
[14:28:13] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I know, and I do really appreciate it, but I want it to animate and I got an error when I tried on my site
[14:28:18] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:28:26] <robertmaxrees> the replace the scrollTop i used.
[14:28:48] <robertmaxrees> that's all you needed to change.  btw - scroll animations are kind of a UX no-no.
[14:28:52] <Azrael_-> robertmaxrees: how can i check if the document is valid? the elements are generated by the php-code from the backend
[14:29:12] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- the w3 validator?
[14:29:16] <robertmaxrees> aaaaand lunch
[14:29:49] <Pazician> robertLunch: Alright, I'll try to make it. Thank you for your time!
[14:32:15] <Azrael_-> the only non-valid items are some custom attributes i added to some links. e.g. <a href="#" catid="123" id="cat123"> beyond this, the document is valid
[14:45:07] <spookah> How can I find all table rows where each cell contains the class "findme".  If any table cell does not contain the class "findme" it shouldnt match.  thanks in advance!
[14:52:32] <taplar> spookah: find all your rows and then filter on the count of rows without that class being less than 1
[14:52:44] <taplar> *count of cells
[15:13:17] <Azrael_-> why does "$('#tbodycat12 tr.artrow:visible').length" show 0 if being called "$( document ).ready(function() {" and lateron the real number although the table is static?
[15:16:21] <robertLunch> try a window load instead.
[15:16:35] <robertLunch> if that works, your document is invalid.
[15:22:12] <Azrael_-> tried window load, no change
[15:22:17] <robertLunch> show us your code then.
[15:22:24] <robertLunch> because we're running blind.
[15:22:46] <Azrael_-> yeah i know, but trimming it down to a small example isn't really easy :)
[15:23:23] <robertmaxrees> invalid document is about the only thing that makes sense at this point.  otherwise, that content isn't static.
[15:23:24] <Azrael_-> will try to analyze and set up an example
[15:29:55] <MalditoDev> hi all, one a web page, when your tryign to debug a piece of JS. Is it possible to see exactly what JS is being using for example on a click event?
[15:30:36] <robertmaxrees> sort of - most debuggers can show you the event handlers bound to an element
[15:31:01] <kevireilly> you can always get crazy with the cheese wiz and step through code also
[15:31:16] <robertmaxrees> hard to know what you're stepping through if you don't know what's bound :)
[15:32:40] <MalditoDev> so for example, keepign it simple I have a menu lkink that when clicked is show a drop down. I know its being done with js. but how, with lets say chrome dev tools can I see the actual code doing it?
[15:33:01] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7338193/using-chrome-how-to-find-whos-binded-to-an-event
[15:33:04] <decx> i dont know how chrome does it but firefox does have a little ev next to them elements
[15:33:17] <robertmaxrees> MalditoDev check out that link.
[15:33:45] <MalditoDev> kk thanks, reading now
[15:41:43] <Azrael_-> ok, i think i found my error. i'm hiding rows of a table which is in "not-yet-shown" popup and then i want to calculate how man visible rows of a category are left. as the popup isn't visible at the start all rows are invisible. if i perform the same action lateron when the popup is visible, then it works fine.  any suggestions how i could handle this in the first case best?
[15:42:04] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the code.
[15:43:45] <Azrael_-> ok, i'll solve it by a custom data-attribute and filter it by that
[15:43:55] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:43:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:44:50] <Azrael_-> is my approach that bad?
[15:45:00] <robertmaxrees> your explanation really doesn't make sense.
[15:45:08] <robertmaxrees> "hiding" as in...
[15:46:03] <Azrael_-> "hiding" as in $("#sometr").hide();
[15:46:13] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't matter then.
[15:46:50] <robertmaxrees> .hide() means they're still selectable.
[15:46:56] <robertmaxrees> so that shouldn't have any impact.
[15:47:49] <Azrael_-> exactly, but "$('#tbodycat12 tr.artrow:visible').length" is always 0 if the table is in a popup which is still invisible as then the table and all containing rows are also invisible. if the user opens the popup it works just fine
[15:47:58] <robertmaxrees> oh for :visible
[15:48:12] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it, yeah.
[15:48:13] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[15:48:19] <robertmaxrees> this is why code examples are cool lol
[15:48:40] <Azrael_-> i know, but i didn't know how to trim it down to a functional small examplet
[15:48:41] <Azrael_-> -t
[15:49:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it, but 9/10 people are conflating what all you actually need in the example :)
[15:49:03] <Azrael_-> so a data-attribute to filter is fine instead of :visible or do you suggest something different?
[15:49:04] <robertmaxrees> not a big deal.
[15:49:23] <robertmaxrees> what does the visible signify?
[15:49:31] <robertmaxrees> is there some other status that already exists that you can use.
[15:50:18] <VectorX> is there a efficient way to get the links, a[href^="#"] ?
[15:50:23] <VectorX> or is that it
[15:50:25] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:50:36] <robertmaxrees> all links that start with # you mean?
[15:50:36] <Azrael_-> no there isn't. the user adds an article from a list. if the article is added i hide this one as you aren't allowed to add it twice. and if no articles are left in a category i also want to hide the category
[15:50:38] <VectorX> a tags that have a # href value
[15:50:50] <robertmaxrees> VectorX use .filter() instead imo.
[15:51:05] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- a data attribute makes sense then.  otherwise just .remove() them instead.
[15:51:14] <Azrael_-> ok, thanks
[15:51:41] <FutureTense> Can someone take a look at this fiddler and tell me how to fix the large gaps in my accordion sections?  Each section has a different number of elements below it, and it looks like it the browser is making the "size" of each section based upon the largest section.   http://jsfiddle.net/hjUbM/119/
[15:51:47] <robertmaxrees> VectorX why do you need all links that start with a hash?
[15:52:07] <VectorX> im trying to prevent them from going to the top of the screen when clicked
[15:52:20] <FutureTense> eg if you go to the 2nd to last section (which is the largest) you see a lot of elements, while other sections have smaller number of elements but when you open it there is a lot of white space
[15:52:20] <robertmaxrees> VectorX are they doing something else already?
[15:52:36] <VectorX> they open a menu
[15:52:51] <robertmaxrees> VectorX then fix your event bindings.
[15:52:58] <decx> FutureTense: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-heightStyle
[15:53:41] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[15:55:24] <VectorX> robertmaxrees hmm, guess thats a better way overall :)
[15:55:33] <robertmaxrees> VectorX yep ;)
[15:55:59] <VectorX> damn stickey menu, now the thing doesnt open enough when its not at the top
[15:56:00] <VectorX> arg
[15:57:58] <VectorX> dow goes up 300 points in one day, whats next
[15:58:11] <VectorX> sorry wrong chan
[15:58:30] <Azrael_-> robertmaxrees: thanks for the help, works like a charm
[15:58:50] <FutureTense> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/hjUbM/122/  Am I doing this right?  It looks like "content" is what I want, but it appears to make no difference
[15:59:49] <robertmaxrees> why are you loading jquery ui twice?
[16:01:18] <FutureTense> decx: I take that back -- it does work in my code.  But not Fiddler... I wonder why?
[16:01:24] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle
[16:01:40] <robertmaxrees> and probably because you don't have all the other styles and things that constrain the elements.
[16:03:46] <decx> weird
[16:04:17] <decx> oh i see
[16:04:21] <decx> you have tons of inline styles
[16:45:45] <hrusti> I have a classical inheritance question. Why do I have to set Child.prototype.constructor to Child function? I can't find an example where objects behaviour is different that without setting it.
[16:46:28] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't really support classical inheritance hth ;)
[16:47:46] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript
[16:47:49] <robertmaxrees> this explains the idea.
[17:18:00] <cbg-fynrir> Is it possible to change the color of the small arrow that appears with ui-resizable-se?
[17:18:15] <cbg-fynrir> I need it changed since it is damn near invisible.
[17:18:45] <robertmaxrees> which one?
[17:18:58] <jphase> cbg-fynrir: you need to roll your own UI theme if you're trying to customize jQuery UI - they have a theme roller that does it for you
[17:19:12] <cbg-fynrir> Theme roller?
[17:19:32] <jphase> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[17:20:38] <cbg-fynrir> Would that generate a CSS file not unlike what the google CDN is hosting (The default jquery-ui.css thing)
[17:21:32] <jphase> cbg-fynrir: it typically just recreates the sprite images used
[17:21:50] <jphase> it doesn't change the jquery-ui.css but the theme css you include on top of that changes, I'm sure
[17:22:17] <decx> it's a big old hassle if you just want to change one thing
[17:22:27] <decx> write a css rule
[17:24:29] <cbg-fynrir> ui-icon-gripsmall-diagonal-se
[17:24:55] <cbg-fynrir> background-color just makes the entire box green. The icon itself is unchanged.
[17:25:03] <cbg-fynrir> Do they rely on fonts or images?
[17:29:17] <VectorX> i need to create a resposnive version of this http://bit.ly/1jD64gu whole inforgraphic sort of thing, currently most of it is an image with overlaping text etc, any suggestions ?
[17:30:23] <robertmaxrees> not sure how you'd make that responsive.
[18:20:05] <Duvdevan> what's the official bootstrap channel here?

[18:25:44] <robertmaxrees> there's a lot of text outside of a form.
[18:26:16] <b0t> I need send the html code in a specific div to mysql
[18:26:38] <robertmaxrees> you can use ajax to do that or create a hidden form.
[18:30:28] <b0t> Youre crazy
[18:30:44] <robertmaxrees> those are your options.
[18:33:27] <Bootinbull> bOt: pretty rude considering... 1. You're the one who doesn't know what you're doing. 2.rmr is the man... he helps a lot of people and knows what he's doing.
[18:33:52] <robertmaxrees> hah.  it's all good - sometimes folks just aren't aware :)
[18:34:04] <Bootinbull> I guess not...
[18:34:11] <robertmaxrees> but thanks.
[18:34:18] <Bootinbull> anytime
[18:34:28] <royalty> I need to conquer alaska
[18:34:30] <royalty> what can i do
[18:34:36] <robertmaxrees> don't.
[18:34:39] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:34:45] <Bootinbull> step one, buy snowshoes
[18:35:11] <royalty> I russian i already know dees
[18:36:51] <robertmaxrees> so b0t why am i crazy?
[18:37:50] <royalty> i was thinking of bringing new species to alaska, of alpha woolf
[18:37:52] <b0t> Check your answer
[18:38:01] <royalty> these would do my beeding
[18:38:10] <robertmaxrees> b0t that's doesn't answer my question - why is that crazy?
[18:38:24] <robertmaxrees> how else do you expect to send data to the server?
[18:38:27] <royalty> is there wolf breeding irc channel?
[18:39:14] <robertmaxrees> unless you're doing a plain get and munging the entire contents of that div into a QSP, but that's not going to work out very well in the long run.
[18:42:07] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:42:17] <robertmaxrees> loooong week so far.
[18:42:40] <royalty> me too
[18:42:44] <royalty> :(
[18:43:58] <kngSimpl> how would you submit a form after a success ajax call like within $.post('url', function() {..... would this be $(selector).submit()?? Initially i put e.preventdefault before the call
[18:45:18] <gnarf> kngSimpl: $("#myform").submit() will submit it
[18:45:27] <gnarf> but it will also run a .on("submit") handler
[18:45:36] <gnarf> so if you are trying to "continue submission"
[18:45:43] <gnarf> unbind the handler before you call .submit()
[18:46:01] <gnarf> or set some flag in global state that knows not to prevent the default because it was "programatticly called"
[18:46:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:46:20] <robertmaxrees> gnarf ftw
[18:46:22] <kngSimpl> gnarf thanks!
[18:47:51] <robertmaxrees> gnarf it's been a while!  how've you been?
[18:47:52] <gnarf> kngSimpl: Usually though - you don't want the default browser form submission behavior (full page reload, new url, etc)
[18:48:10] <gnarf> kngSimpl: maybe look at using .ajaxSubmit() from the ajaxForm plugin?
[18:48:41] <gnarf> robertmaxrees: good - working on infrastructure - redeploying the jQuery world ya know
[18:48:54] <robertmaxrees> ooooh.  sounds fancy
[18:49:16] <gnarf> we just had an awesome developer summit in NYC last weekend
[18:49:29] <robertmaxrees> i heard about that!  and that it was it productive.
[18:49:37] <gnarf> https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jqsummit&src=typd
[18:52:15] <gnarf> robertmaxrees: hardest part of this project so far has been writing the blog post about it - lol
[18:52:20] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:52:37] <robertmaxrees> telling the story is always the hardest part.
[18:52:39] <gnarf> promised bocoup I'd write a blog post about it if they gave me a few weeks to get caught up on the jQuery infrastructure stuff :)
[18:53:09] <robertmaxrees> that's really cool.
[18:53:15] <gnarf> ansible is pretty awesome I gotta say
[18:53:17] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a lot of movement going on.
[19:04:33] <ZeuZ> http://codepad.org/1zD0Rnxj ---> How can I add a setTimeout there at the specified point?
[19:05:58] <gnarf> ZeuZ: setTimeout( this.startTimer.bind(this), 3000 )
[19:06:11] <gnarf> if you can rely on Function.prototype.bind
[19:06:19] <gnarf> `g Function.prototype.bind
[19:06:19] <b-ot> (gnarf) This command requires a custom Google Search Engine ID.
[19:06:37] <gnarf> `mdn Function.prototype.bind
[19:06:51] <gnarf> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[19:06:58] <gnarf> (be your own bot...)
[19:10:41] <ZeuZ> you mean also adding prototype library>
[19:11:11] <royalty> no
[19:11:41] <ZeuZ> because otherwwise setTimeout(this.startTimer.bind(this),3000) errors
[19:12:37] <royalty> what is the error
[19:13:09] <ZeuZ> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'bind' of undefined
[19:13:18] <shoky> ZeuZ you want to call the same function?  it's startSlider, not startTimer
[19:13:18] <robertmaxrees> this.startTimer doesn't exist.
[19:14:19] <ZeuZ> the function is defined inside the return
[19:14:29] <ZeuZ> oh
[19:14:31] <ZeuZ> sorry
[19:15:08] <ZeuZ> nope still undefined
[19:15:17] <shoky> "this" is probably not what you think it is
[19:15:29] <Redmega> Hi all. I'm trying to use a certain jquery plugin "noty". I have installed it with npm install noty --save into my node.js website. But now I am confused on how to use it. Am I supposed to move it out of my node_modules folder and into my js folder and use it normally, or is there a specially way to include it since I've installed it as an npm package?
[19:15:45] <shoky> it would only be that same object if startSlider was originally called with "this" bound to that object
[19:15:56] <Redmega> The documentation doesnt mention
[19:16:11] <ZeuZ> shoky, how can I do that?
[19:17:10] <shoky> ZeuZ:  you call it on the actual object like  obj.startSlider();   or you call it while binding "this" manually, e.g. with .bind or .call or .apply
[19:17:49] <ZeuZ> Hmm wait, not getting it...
[19:17:55] <ZeuZ> mund giving me a quick example?
[19:18:14] <shoky> quoting #javascript's bot:  If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function wasn't defined in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
[19:20:52] <shoky> ZeuZ: quick example  http://jsfiddle.net/p6b8wtow/
[19:21:09] <shoky> oops
[19:21:34] <shoky> ZeuZ:  http://jsfiddle.net/p6b8wtow/1/
[19:22:05] <ZeuZ> but my object is anonymous
[19:22:13] <ZeuZ> I mean
[19:22:20] <ZeuZ> sorry anonymous is not the word
[19:22:38] <ZeuZ> object is in the return statement, I need it to call self
[19:22:42] <ZeuZ> tried the bind already
[19:22:46] <ZeuZ> it errors out
[19:23:09] <shoky> donno what you mean.. update the fiddle
[19:23:58] <ZeuZ> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/14a0tts0/
[19:26:08] <shoky> ZeuZ: it's not anonymous, it's called actualSlider
[19:26:24] <ZeuZ> then agian, how do I call itself from itself?
[19:27:22] <shoky> from itself? the way we told you, the way you're doing. your problem is with the original call (not from itself)
[19:27:38] <shoky> setTimeout(actualSlider.startSlider,3000);     your problem is here
[19:28:05] <shoky> actualSlider.startSlider  is a reference to that function, but this reference is not bound with any value of "this"
[19:28:59] <ZeuZ> the original call is from the setTimeout line at the end in document.ready
[19:29:13] <shoky> yes, the line i just quoted
[19:29:54] <ZeuZ> then how do I call it upon?
[19:30:02] <ZeuZ> it should be delayed at first
[19:30:14] <shoky> you bind its value of this
[19:30:25] <shoky> setTimeout(actualSlider.startSlider.bind(actualSlider), 3000)
[19:30:52] <shoky> all this would be much easier without using "this" at all ;P
[19:31:19] <ZeuZ> how would it be?
[19:31:36] <ZeuZ> I dont really understand how it works now but it works as you said yeah
[19:31:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:31:47] <robertmaxrees> that's part of the problem.
[19:31:59] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to reason about waht the code is doing.
[19:32:54] <gnarf> basically same as setTimeout(function() { actualSlider.startSlider(); }, 3000)
[19:33:05] <ZeuZ> when it binds it, this inside itself becomes the object itself, right/
[19:34:09] <gnarf> (function() { return this }.bind( a ))( ) === a
[19:34:47] <ZeuZ> ah, I think I get it now
[19:35:11] <gnarf> .bind() returns a new function that forces the `this` to be set to the first arg
[19:35:15] <gnarf> when it is called
[19:35:41] <gnarf> read more about this
[19:35:51] <gnarf> shoky had some good links
[19:36:24] <ZeuZ> will do, will come back with doubts for sure  :P
[19:36:29] <gnarf> The docs page for .bind() is pretty good at describing it too
[19:36:31] <gnarf> on mdn
[19:45:02] <shoky> ZeuZ: example of not using `this` for the returned object   http://jsfiddle.net/p6b8wtow/2/
[19:46:30] <ZeuZ> shoky, looks a lot cleaner
[19:47:05] <shoky> agreed ;]
[19:48:11] <cbg-fynrir> I have a question: http://pastebin.com/ZQmQq6J3
[19:49:46] <shoky> cbg-fynrir:  $(this).remove();  if i understood correctly
[19:50:19] <shoky> cbg-fynrir:   that's assuming there's no space before the "button" part of the selector
[19:57:32] <cbg-fynrir> The button part is to be discarded.
[19:57:46] <robertmaxrees> the thing that was clicked?  then yeah, $(this) refers to that element.
[19:57:51] <robertmaxrees> so you can just $(this).remove();
[19:58:04] <cbg-fynrir> Only added it into the actual div that contains the X letter in order to seperate the actual div that needs to be removed.
[19:58:43] <cbg-fynrir> I need the div I want to target gone from the page completely.
[19:59:05] <robertmaxrees> so $('#{$div_id}button').click(function() { should really be $('#{$div_id} button').click(function() { ?
[19:59:32] <cbg-fynrir> No ignore the button text.
[20:00:06] <robertmaxrees> so the div is a parent element of the thing you're clicking?
[20:00:42] <cbg-fynrir> DivParent(XbuttonDiv)DivParent
[20:00:49] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything to me.
[20:00:56] <robertmaxrees> you need to share the relevant html.
[20:04:11] <fas3r> hello
[20:04:32] <cbg-fynrir> http://pastebin.com/J3mew0Hj
[20:05:24] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('.youjqtubecontainer').remove();
[20:06:00] <shoky> unless the button is inside the iframe :P
[20:06:05] <robertmaxrees> hah, truth.
[20:06:06] <cbg-fynrir> YES!
[20:06:08] <shoky> or something wacky like that
[20:06:12] <cbg-fynrir> It works.
[20:06:17] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com yo.
[20:06:18] <shoky> woot
[20:06:20] <robertmaxrees> your new best friend.
[20:06:23] <fas3r> I'm playing with the regex, and I was wondering if there is a shortest way for this : /^([0-9]|0[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):(0[0-5]|[0-9])$/g         basically it's checking the format of the "hour" in 24h type, from 0:00 / 00:00  to 23:59
[20:06:42] <gnarf> `g mdn bind
[20:06:44] <b-ot> (gnarf) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind -- Function.prototype.bind() - JavaScript | MDN: "Sep 1, 2015 ... The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of..."
[20:06:47] <gnarf> yay
[20:06:48] <cbg-fynrir> But wait, does not the . in ('.youjqtubecontainer') denote a class?
[20:07:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:07:12] <robertmaxrees> . is class.
[20:07:46] <cbg-fynrir> Well I changed it to #. Now I got what I want.
[20:07:48] <cbg-fynrir> Thanks.
[20:07:54] <robertmaxrees> that's for an id then.
[20:08:20] <gnarf> if there can be more than one, you should use a class -- ID should be unique to a page
[20:08:40] <robertmaxrees> ^'
[20:08:51] <cbg-fynrir> But if you create several players?
[20:09:21] <robertmaxrees> use classes.
[20:09:24] <gnarf> they can't all have '#youjqcontainer'
[20:10:22] <cbg-fynrir> Yes. But I never said each player will have that as an ID.
[20:10:28] <gnarf> for the most part you should use classes instead of id's just like, always
[20:10:32] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:10:45] <gnarf> if you changed it to '#' you switched to searching for an ID
[20:11:18] <gnarf> you should be using class='youjqtubecontainer'
[20:11:28] <gnarf> and '.youjqtubecontainer'
[20:12:45] <shoky> fas3r: if i didn't make any mistakes.. this is shorter and more correct   /^([01]?\d|2[0-3]):([0-5][0-9])$/g
[20:13:15] <shoky> fas3r:  you had   (0[0-5]|[0-9])  for the minutes part, doesn't seem right
[20:13:43] <fas3r> shoky: yep sorry :)
[20:14:03] <fas3r> shoky: ok thanks. would you mind to explain it please ?
[20:14:11] <shoky> fas3r: which part?
[20:15:11] <shoky> [01]?  means either nothing, or 0, or 1.   \d is same as [0-9]
[20:15:52] <shoky> anyways this #javascript or #regex topic
[20:16:28] <fas3r> true.
[20:16:59] <fas3r> it's the ? which confuse me. I thought it was use only for grouping. anyway thanks for your time.
[20:17:28] <fas3r> grouping like negative, positive, equal..
[20:17:29] <shoky> it means zero or one occurences of a character from the previous set
[20:17:41] <fas3r> ok
[20:17:48] <shoky> so zero or one occurences of a charcter from the set {0,1}
[20:18:34] <fas3r> and stupid question, as wero occurence is not possible, I would have to set {1,} .. how I would do that .. I mean to place it for the first [01]?
[20:18:48] <fas3r> occurence*
[20:18:54] <shoky> what do you mean that zero occurence is not possible?
[20:19:30] <shoky> you said it can be either  0:00 or 00:00  so for that first character, it can be zero occurences if the format is 0:00
[20:19:58] <fas3r> my bad.. wrong interpretation, by zero occurence I thought you meant "null".
[20:20:02] <fas3r> like empty.
[20:21:30] <shoky> in your regex you had this part:   [0-9]|0[0-9]|1[0-9]    which means one of these 3 options:  a) a digit.   b)  0 followed by a digit.   c)  1 followed by a digit
[20:21:42] <fas3r> yes.
[20:21:49] <fas3r> it's the long version :).
[20:22:12] <shoky> for the (a) option,  its the same as "nothing, followed by a digit"
[20:22:16] <gnarf> -> /\d|0\d|1\d/
[20:22:23] <gnarf> \d = [0-9]
[20:22:25] <shoky> or "zero occurences of whatever, followed by a digit"
[20:22:34] <gnarf> -> /\d|[01]\d/
[20:22:37] <shoky> or "zero occurences of 0 or 1, followed by a digit"
[20:22:47] <gnarf> -> /[01]?\d/
[20:24:15] <shoky> (so combining a,b,c  you get  "zero or one occurences of 0 or 1, followed by a digit"
[20:24:16] <shoky> )
[20:26:05] <gnarf> i was joking w/ someone that the date range on my gravestone should be written in regexp
[20:26:27] <fas3r> oki. that's why I asked. shoky, gnarf thanks for your time and your explaination.
[20:26:30] <shoky> lol
[20:26:34] <fas3r> haha
[20:26:57] <gnarf>  /19[89]\d|200\d|201[0-5]/ so far
[20:31:14] <fas3r> in which case should I use the braket then as delimiter ?
[20:32:28] <gnarf> what are you calling a braket ?
[20:32:36] <gnarf> [abc] matches a b or c
[20:32:39] <fas3r> like {1, 2 }
[20:32:53] <gnarf> {1} means match the previous thing once
[20:32:54] <gnarf> so
[20:32:59] <gnarf> \d{2} means 2 digits
[20:33:12] <gnarf> \d{0,} means match zero or more
[20:33:17] <gnarf> so does \d*
[20:33:23] <gnarf> * = {0,}
[20:33:31] <gnarf> ? = {0,1}
[20:33:55] <fas3r> oki.
[20:35:11] <gnarf> () are groups
[20:35:14] <gnarf> | is or
[20:35:28] <gnarf>  /foo|bar/ -- "foo" or "bar"
[20:36:15] <gnarf>  /f(ro|or)|ba[rz]/ -- "fro" "for" "bar" "baz"
[20:57:45] <VectorX> got an onchange event on a select, what would i trigger if they select the same item
[20:57:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:58:15] <robertmaxrees> every tiume i see this question i'm confused about why you'd do anything if nothing changed.
[20:59:36] <VectorX> i got a infinitescroll thing on it, so i guess it would reset
[20:59:47] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[21:05:04] <VectorX> :)
[21:05:32] <robertmaxrees> so let's be clear - the user didn't actually change anything.  the form is still in the exact same state.
[21:05:41] <robertmaxrees> so you want to take "no change" as "something happened"?
[21:07:50] <VectorX> similar setup to this, but with the resource items as an infinite scroll, so you scroll halfway down then come back up and select the same thing again
[21:07:57] <VectorX> i would reset the scroll
[21:08:56] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like really confusing UX.
[21:09:10] <robertmaxrees> but i'd set the dropdown back to its default state i guess,
[21:09:46] <VectorX> reset the scroll in the same selection
[21:10:11] <robertmaxrees> so the dropdown sounds like a bad choice here.
[21:10:27] <VectorX> im only asking coz a bunch of testers kept asking why when you select the same thing nothing seems to happen
[21:10:30] <VectorX> fkn morns
[21:10:37] <robertmaxrees> because everything you've just described sounds like it'd be terribly confusing to normal end users.
[21:10:39] <VectorX> lol
[21:10:43] <robertmaxrees> and dropdowns tend to be bad ux.
[21:13:16] <robertmaxrees> but you'd ust .click() for that.  but now you have to detect if anything changed.
[21:17:50] <jeffreylevesque> is styleguide one word, or two?
[21:27:32] <shoky> yes
[21:51:21] <mokopop> Hey, anyone know what's wrong with this? Why does it break after the first toggle cycle? Try clicking 'm' more than 3 times. jsbin.com/fiyefozefa/edit?js,output
[22:04:43] <shoky> mokopop:  use .prop('checked',  true/false)
[22:13:32] <mokopop> shoky: oh, it's good to see you.
[22:13:43] <mokopop> i've been in under different names that i don't remember, but not for years.
[22:13:57] <mokopop> it's fun to recognize you, though.
[22:14:07] <mokopop> what's happening that's making it happen like that?
[22:21:51] <shoky> mokopop: attributes are not meant for changing the runtime state of elements, that's what properties are for
[22:23:19] <mokopop> shoky: what specifically causes the first one-off execution to function properly, and not the subsequent ones?
[22:27:01] <shoky> mokopop: not sure exactly
[22:28:22] <mokopop> meh.
[22:30:48] <shoky> :S
[23:02:43] <Respek> hi all, can anyone help me? I'm having a crisis with ie8/9.
