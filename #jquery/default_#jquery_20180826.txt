[01:38:38] <Lenswipee> hi, does javascript need to use escape functions when inserting html to a page like you do with PHP?
[12:22:42] <chaosisgod> pft
[22:01:09] <compact> hi. any idea why my ID Won't change? https://jsfiddle.net/v47qo5ck/7/
[22:28:14] <compact> ?
[22:34:19] <shoky> compact: because you're doing .find('.multi-leg')  but it doesn't have a descendant .multi-leg element
[22:34:34] <shoky> you can just remove the .find()
[22:35:43] <compact> https://jsfiddle.net/v47qo5ck/12/
[22:35:49] <compact> it just duplicates then?
[22:36:02] <compact> ah i see why
[22:36:44] <compact> https://jsfiddle.net/v47qo5ck/12/ - changes all of the id's and not just the one that cloned
[22:37:14] <shoky> compact: that's what  $('.multi-leg').attr('id', ...
[22:37:16] <shoky> does
[22:37:36] <shoky> find all .multi-leg elements in the DOM, and change their ids
[22:42:07] <compact> wouldn't find be better though?
[22:42:56] <shoky> compact: .find() looks for descendant elements.  you want to change the clone itself, not one of its descendants
