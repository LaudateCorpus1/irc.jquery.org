[02:11:25] <undefined_bob> good morning
[02:38:51] <hellyeah> undefined_bob,  how goes?
[02:54:47] <undefined_bob> hellyeah everything is complicated but overall I'm fine, thanks. and you?
[02:55:13] <hellyeah> well fair enough
[02:56:17] <undefined_bob> ya today I try to solve an annoying problem
[03:02:44] <undefined_bob> some conten on my page is like this: accordion1 --> accordion2 --> content_1, content_2 and so on. accordion1 reveals on click accordion2 and accordion2 on click the content_1 and so on. every accordion and every content has a fragment url like #accordion1. if someone access the page using #according1 the accordion autmatically reveals accordion2. but if someone use #content_1 to access nothing happen and all
[03:02:44] <undefined_bob> accordions stay closed
[03:02:53] <undefined_bob> thats the problem I try to solve today :)
[03:10:28] <hellyeah> did you fiddle it?
[03:12:53] <hellyeah> do you have jqury ui problem or jquery problem?
[03:13:14] <hellyeah> oh man
[03:13:23] <hellyeah> if you do position:fixed for dialog
[03:13:28] <hellyeah> it breaks
[03:27:09] <cryocaustik> hi - what would be the best way to call this changeBarHeight function recursively? http://jsbin.com/jideqer/edit?output
[03:36:25] <undefined_bob> hellyeah no, its not really possible to fiddle. but I have it on my test page http://undefined.bplaced.net/produkte/hauptprodukt_2/current/index.html
[03:38:01] <undefined_bob> tried to put it all in a pen but it doesnt really work https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/YYLgOK
[03:46:28] <AdamPDotty> cryocaustik: explain "recursively"
[03:50:17] <Cork> cryocaustik: also it is better to recurs the .bar-item loop instead of starting multiple timers with assumed time offset (as it isn't guaranteed that assumption will be true)
[03:51:47] <cryocaustik> by recursively I mean call the function again once it is completed changing all the elements
[03:53:51] <cryocaustik> what I am struggling with is understanding how I can callback to the function at the end of the loop, since the .each() loop is async
[03:53:54] <Cork> cryocaustik: https://jsfiddle.net/wd9nL52v/
[03:54:21] <Cork> that will loop indefinitely
[03:54:40] <Cork> actaully https://jsfiddle.net/wd9nL52v/1/
[03:54:50] <Cork> else it will run with nothing one loop
[03:55:32] <Cork> also you should prob use a rAF to not do this while the page isn't visible
[03:56:16] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/wd9nL52v/2/
[03:59:10] <cryocaustik> Cork: it doesn't seem to execute at all: https://jsfiddle.net/wd9nL52v/3/
[03:59:54] <Cork> bah typo
[04:00:01] <Cork> ReferenceError: itesm is not defined
[04:00:20] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/wd9nL52v/4/
[04:03:26] <cryocaustik> awesome! thanks for the help. I def. didn't think of doing the recurs. at that level
[04:03:41] <cryocaustik> will keep this in mind for future attempts!
[05:11:26] <undefined_bob> any hint how I could add an additional 'click' on id='test' to this one liner? https://jsfiddle.net/jdugdhz5/1/
[05:15:48] <AdamPDotty> $('#test').trigger('click');
[05:20:03] <hellyeah> can i use display flex in jquery ui
[05:20:32] <hellyeah> i mean when i shrink or expand browser i want to see dialog respond size of viewport
[05:20:37] <hellyeah> is it possible?
[05:35:06] <undefined_bob> AdamPDotty thanks I know this syntax but I'm not sure how I could implement that in the line of code I already have
[05:35:15] <Cork> hellyeah: you can't use flex, but you can have the dialog resize based on the resize event
[05:35:52] <Cork> undefined_bob: convert the if case to a multi liner and add it before or after the old click
[05:36:15] <hellyeah> resize event hmm
[05:36:48] <hellyeah> can resize event determine when page shink or grow?
[05:37:15] <Cork> that is kinda the point of the resize event...
[05:37:39] <hellyeah> good
[05:37:44] <hellyeah> let me try it
[05:45:03] <undefined_bob> hm like this? https://jsfiddle.net/jdugdhz5/2/
[05:50:49] <Cork> undefined_bob: ya, though you are clicking two elements now so i don't really get what you're trying to do
[05:52:21] <undefined_bob> the first element with the id='test' shall be clicked before the other element. because the other element get only revealed when the first one is open
[05:53:36] <undefined_bob> for example this link should open the content of Hersteller A and the content of Typenübersicht 1 A
[05:53:37] <undefined_bob> http://undefined.bplaced.net/produkte/hauptprodukt_2/current/index.html#Typenuebersicht_1_A
[05:54:49] <undefined_bob> but that doesnt work by now. I so thought adding an extra click to Hersteller A before the script open Typenübersicht 1 A should do the trick
[05:55:13] <undefined_bob> but seems like I am wrong
[06:02:34] <hellyeah> is there any real difference between $(function(){()}; and (function(){}())
[06:03:03] <Cork> yes
[06:03:09] <jordansz> hi everyone, i have this assignment like colHeaders: function (col) { } inside the method it does something with col var
[06:03:28] <Cork> $(function() {}) waits for the document to finish loading
[06:03:35] <jordansz> i wonder how can i use an eternal method instead?   something like  colHeaders: my_custom_method(col)
[06:03:44] <jordansz> and then have that method as a function defined elsewhere
[06:03:46] <Cork> (function() {})() is just a function scope wrapper, it doesn't change the execution order at all
[06:04:15] <Cork> jordansz: you can't pass arguments if you use a named function
[06:04:26] <Cork> colHeaders: my_custom_method
[06:04:47] <Cork> () executs it and the return value would be set as colHeaders instead of a callback
[06:04:51] <jordansz> its an 'inline function' i think that colHeaders: gets the value of this function(col)... the col var is passed into it right
[06:05:39] <Cork> { colHeaders: function(col) {} }; is identical to function myHandler(col) {} { colHeaders: myHandler }
[06:06:27] <Cork> well except the function isn't named :)
[06:09:12] <jordansz> Cork im still learning thank you, but how would i move that code to an external function defined elsewhere
[06:09:28] <Cork> jordansz: no difference
[06:09:38] <Cork> as long as the function name is accessable it works the same
[06:15:09] <jordansz> Cork  it does not work the inline function works but not when i move it outside i get an undefined 'col' variable error and don;'t understand
[06:15:31] <Cork> jordansz: you didn't add the attribute to the function you defined
[06:15:40] <Cork> myHandler(col) {} <--
[06:16:17] <Cork> *argument
[06:16:57] <jordansz> Cork  its like this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0155957e0c8ab48771ad54f87dd9c3c7
[06:17:35] <Cork> jordansz: so your mycustom_function returns a function?
[06:17:43] <Cork> cause that is what you are stating there
[06:18:08] <Cork> function mycustom_function() { return function() {} } or something like that
[06:18:22] <Cork> don't have () if you want to have the function referenced
[06:18:22] <jordansz> it should load my custom_function so i don'thave to 'inline' define the colheaders but have a custom method that sets them
[06:18:26] <Cork> like i said () executes it
[06:19:14] <jordansz> ahhh now i get it thank you very much!
[06:20:12] <undefined_bob> Cork any idea where I am wrong in my thinking which cause that my approach doesnt work?
[06:20:40] <Cork> undefined_bob: don't know the code base good enough to say
[06:20:51] <Cork> might be the content isn't just hidden
[06:21:06] <Cork> might be the parent need to be clicked before the second event handler exists
[06:21:13] <Cork> might be... a lot of other things :)
[06:21:31] <undefined_bob> hm I see
[06:29:15] <undefined_bob> I mean I am able to expand the hidden content of the second element while the first element is still closed. so when I manually click on the first element, it revealed the already expanded second element
[06:29:37] <undefined_bob> is it understandable what I try to say?
[06:33:09] <undefined_bob> does the $('test').trigger('click'); also work when the div which contain the id is inside an other div? <div class="my_class"><div class="myclass2"><a id="test"
[06:42:41] <undefined_bob> maybe this can help to show what I mean https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/vprBGp
[07:33:26] <hellyeah> hey
[07:33:32] <hellyeah> what am i missing here https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/
[07:39:37] <Cork> you're creating a bunch of tables
[07:40:45] <hellyeah> what about now https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/3/
[07:41:17] <Cork> what about it?
[07:41:49] <hellyeah> still create many tables
[07:42:03] <Cork> well ya but you don't use them
[07:42:21] <Cork> now you just log the original table and append undefined
[07:42:50] <hellyeah> yeah i see
[07:42:59] <Cork> ah no sorry the log i outside the append
[07:43:19] <Cork> anyway row[0] is empty text not the tr
[07:44:22] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/7
[07:44:27] <Cork> not sure why you clone the row once and then move it and changes it
[07:44:38] <Cork> i suspect you intended to create multiple rows
[07:44:51] <Cork> (though row is table @_@')
[07:44:51] <hellyeah> yeah
[07:45:34] <hellyeah> well
[07:45:45] <hellyeah> in my plan the inside row goes into tr
[07:45:55] <hellyeah> some markup was already defined
[07:46:02] <Cork> why are your row <table> though?
[07:46:52] <hellyeah> well
[07:47:02] <hellyeah> i just create tr part of table dynamically
[07:47:07] <hellyeah> other part is static
[07:47:23] <Cork> then call it table not row >_<'
[07:47:23] <hellyeah> thats why i wrote table thead tbody in string template
[07:47:27] <hellyeah> is that wrong?
[07:47:53] <hellyeah> damn
[07:47:53] <Cork> from reading the code you say you append tr to row and that makes no sense
[07:47:55] <hellyeah> you are right
[07:48:04] <hellyeah> row.find('tbody tr')
[07:48:38] <Cork> more like var table = template.clone(); var body = table.find('tbody');
[07:48:45] <Cork> as it is where you want to append the trs
[07:48:53] <Cork> and then body.append(row)
[07:58:12] <hellyeah> Cork,  i am on right track https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/10/
[08:08:58] <hellyeah> it worked
[08:09:01] <hellyeah> cool
[08:09:05] <hellyeah> but
[08:09:12] <hellyeah> something is still missing
[08:13:02] <hellyeah> what am i missing now? https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/16/
[08:14:56] <Woet> hellyeah: check your console.
[08:16:57] <hellyeah> no error on console
[08:18:40] <hellyeah> pls some one help
[08:18:42] <Woet> hellyeah: there is, that's why i said it.
[08:19:07] <Woet> hellyeah: can you try putting some effort in instead of asking this channel each time you change something?
[08:19:36] <hellyeah> Woet,  https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/20/
[08:19:50] <Woet> [21:14:55]  <Woet>	hellyeah: check your console.
[08:19:57] <hellyeah> dude
[08:19:59] <hellyeah> no error
[08:20:01] <hellyeah> look at it
[08:20:07] <hellyeah> come on man
[08:20:14] <Woet> hellyeah: i did, i can see the error.
[08:20:33] <hellyeah> yeah
[08:20:38] <hellyeah> i didnt see the error
[08:20:46] <hellyeah> i see sss text when you click button
[08:20:56] <Woet> hellyeah: what is "sss text"
[08:21:19] <hellyeah> if you look at it you will see it is random text
[08:21:43] <Woet> hellyeah: https://s.woet.me/QSbR3bR2Lw.png
[08:21:48] <Woet> hellyeah: what is random exactly?
[08:21:54] <hellyeah> Woet,
[08:22:18] <hellyeah> i dont have those error
[08:22:23] <hellyeah> i dont know what that means
[08:22:36] <hellyeah> must be about your browser
[08:22:55] <hellyeah> which null
[08:23:55] <Woet> hellyeah: i didn't know you were writing code that only works in your browser
[08:24:31] <hellyeah> oh man
[08:24:38] <hellyeah> i am tired
[08:24:45] <hellyeah> please help me or leave me alone
[08:24:48] <hellyeah> i am so tired
[08:24:49] <thykka> i'm not seeing an error either
[08:24:57] <thykka> not with firefox, chrome nor safari
[08:25:08] <Woet> thykka: happens in my Safari
[08:25:30] <Woet> without extensions too
[08:26:02] <Woet> probably because the HTML is invalid.
[08:26:34] <hellyeah> Woet,  your browser must have some problems
[08:26:40] <hellyeah> as thykka  there is no error
[08:26:47] <hellyeah> why you insist on that
[08:26:52] <hellyeah> i try to solve a problem
[08:28:25] <thykka> https://snag.gy/PqZMmT.jpg
[08:28:29] <hellyeah> table is here https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/22/
[08:28:36] <hellyeah> with small problems thats okey
[08:28:53] <hellyeah> just insert th into tbody
[08:29:23] <hellyeah> thykka,  any suggestion here?
[08:31:36] <thykka> why is your html within a <script>?
[08:31:57] <Cork> thykka: its a template, its quite common to write it like that
[08:32:53] <thykka> perhaps, I don't think it's an appropriate way of making a test case, unless the problem is specifically with the templating engine
[08:33:20] <Cork> thykka: that isn't about the testcase it is the actual code in use
[08:33:46] <Cork> the template is used in the code to generate the resulting table
[08:34:40] <hellyeah> okey i see
[08:34:43] <Cork> but i've answer what should be done in this code a lot of times now and i'm getting a bit tired of answering the same thing over and over again
[08:35:13] <Cork> (as the answer isn't done but something completely different that is still broken)
[08:35:15] <hellyeah> thykka,  i used template because html element is not dynamic at all
[08:35:22] <hellyeah> and it comes when you click something
[08:35:33] <hellyeah> so it is not necessary to bug DOM tree at first
[08:35:40] <hellyeah> at least this is what i am thinking
[08:35:53] <hellyeah> Cork,  i have some progress
[08:35:59] <Cork> not really
[08:36:07] <Cork> you are still looping tables
[08:36:25] <Cork> (when you want to create rows)
[08:46:28] <hellyeah> why i see th values on tbody https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/25/ i dont understand
[08:47:03] <hellyeah> datas are here
[08:47:15] <hellyeah> i am adding values to the td
[08:47:55] <hellyeah> it adds th to tbody
[08:48:33] <hellyeah> yeah
[08:48:36] <hellyeah> i am stupid
[08:55:20] <hellyeah> any help https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/27/ line 21 ? please click button
[08:57:36] <hellyeah> i solved
[08:57:42] <hellyeah> but there is another issue now
[08:57:45] <hellyeah> it never ends
[08:57:46] <hellyeah> :/
[09:06:04] <hellyeah> i did it YAY https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/28/
[09:18:53] <hellyeah> why it prints table two times https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/31/
[09:22:00] <hellyeah> thas good
[09:22:03] <hellyeah> i did everything
[09:28:58] <hellyeah> this is different question
[09:29:19] <hellyeah> using one for avoiding second class is good practice https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/36/
[09:29:44] <undefined_bob> how can I make the script use a specific id instead of the parentNode? id = document.getElementById(id).parentNode.id;
[09:31:32] <hellyeah> dude
[09:31:45] <hellyeah> select like $('.a .b .c');
[09:34:10] <thykka> wwat
[09:34:49] <thykka> you can use a specific id instead of the parentNode with $('#the_id')
[09:35:11] <thykka> or, you know, document.getElementById('the_id');
[09:36:42] <qvarkk> https://jsfiddle.net/r57f5uo6/ - i want to retrieve .poisition().top value for each section on windows resize, BUT the fixed #frame messes it up so it doesnt count from body start
[09:37:43] <undefined_bob> like this? id = document.getElementById(id).$('#the_id');
[09:38:20] <thykka> undefined_bob, no, where'd you get that idea?
[09:39:14] <undefined_bob> no idea :o
[09:39:20] <thykka> yeah
[09:39:32] <undefined_bob> I'm sorry
[09:43:27] <thykka> undefined_bob, let's get to the bottom of this.. You ask "instead of the parentNode", yet the line you posted explicitly asks for a parent of the chosen element. What exactly do you mean, and what exactly is the problem to which selecting an element by ID is the solution?
[09:45:20] <undefined_bob> thats getting too complicated, thykka :/ I know this line asked for a parentNode but this line would be more usefull if it would ask for an id instead of the parentNode. the overall problem is a little bit complex
[09:46:05] <thykka> but you're already selecting by ID *before* ascending to the parentNode??
[09:46:37] <Teduardo> Anybody see a particular issue with this fiddle that would prevent the dropdown from being validated by jquery validationengine? https://jsfiddle.net/a3kj1po0/3/
[09:46:45] <Teduardo> I've been having a heck of a time with it.
[09:46:57] <thykka> what does the validationengine say?
[09:47:08] <MikeD_> undefined_bob: can you make a small use-case example in jsfiddle?
[09:47:45] <Teduardo> thykka: it just keeps blocking the form submission as it sees the field as being not populated
[09:48:27] <undefined_bob> a fiddle is not that easy, MikeD_ but I stated the overall problem on SO https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48226220/reveal-content-hidden-nested-in-two-accordions-using-fragment-url
[09:48:40] <undefined_bob> but thykka is right, I already select the id before
[09:49:01] <undefined_bob> me stupid, I forgot that
[10:45:45] <c0d3n4m3> Hey all, I'm struggling with an ajax issue. There is a site that has a list of posts, and you click on them, and that page then has a download link.
[10:46:30] <c0d3n4m3> I'm trying to use ajax on page load, to pull the download links from the posts, and then display them on the posts, so negating the need to click on them to see the download link
[10:46:56] <z1haze> is there a method like .load but can instead store the result in a variable?
[10:47:01] <z1haze> rather than .ajax
[10:47:40] <c0d3n4m3> I've got it working to a point, where it gets the URLS, but when I try to output the retrieved urls onto each post, it only puts one of the many links
[10:47:42] <c0d3n4m3> https://hastebin.com/osiqaqufer.js
[10:48:13] <c0d3n4m3> I've logged the actual data variable and it does get all the links, but the output to the each post, is always the same link
[10:48:44] <Cork> c0d3n4m3: you want .append not .html
[10:48:47] <Cork> .html replaces
[10:49:02] <c0d3n4m3> Ah, I'll try that :D 2 ticks.
[10:49:15] <Cork> also you want ot use something relative to the source else you add them to one central location
[10:49:24] <Cork> (unless that is the point)
[10:49:42] <Cork> z1haze: that by definition is ajax
[10:50:00] <Cork> z1haze: .load is just an ajax request that uses .html with the response
[10:50:25] <z1haze> yes, I know
[10:50:37] <z1haze> I just like the fluidness of .load
[10:50:44] <z1haze> .ajax isnt as neat
[10:52:04] <Cork> z1haze: what do you mean?
[10:52:39] <Cork> what's the none fluidness of $.ajax(url).done(function(response) { variable = response })?
[10:53:17] <z1haze> I guess i just like `this.$el.load(this.options.url, () => { ...` but it would be cool if i could do $var = $.load(this.options.url) or something
[10:53:38] <Cork> z1haze: that would mean you would have to have syncronous ajax calls
[10:53:54] <Cork> and that is horrible as it freezes the webpage until the server answers
[10:53:55] <z1haze> ah duh
[10:53:57] <z1haze> yeah yeah
[10:53:59] <z1haze> good call
[10:54:19] <Cork> xhr used to be able to do that
[10:54:28] <Cork> but it has been depricated for ages
[10:55:03] <z1haze> I dont know what I was thinkin
[10:55:32] <c0d3n4m3> With .append, it now shows all the links retrieved on every post, but what I'm trying to do is get each posts download url onto each repective post (if that makes any sense)
[10:55:32] <Cork> z1haze: you could do v = $.ajax(url); v.done(function(d) {}) though :)
[10:55:34] <z1haze> is this sufficient then? return $.ajax({url: this.options.url}).then(response => response);
[10:55:52] <Cork> c0d3n4m3: see my second comment it addresses exactly that
[10:56:23] <c0d3n4m3> The relative to source?
[10:56:49] <Cork> something like var more = $(this).find('.more-links') before the ajax call
[10:56:51] <c0d3n4m3> So I would use this
[10:56:54] <Cork> or something like that
[10:56:56] <c0d3n4m3> ah, yeah
[10:57:06] <Cork> else you just grab all elements with the more-links class
[10:57:11] <c0d3n4m3> Ah, ok, got you
[10:57:16] <c0d3n4m3> ty, I'll try it :)
[10:57:34] <Cork> what traversal you need depends on dom structure though
[10:58:51] <c0d3n4m3> Haha! :D Yes, TY!
[10:59:02] <c0d3n4m3> The more=links before ajax call was the key
[10:59:07] <c0d3n4m3> Thankyou!! <3
[10:59:49] <Cork> np
[12:05:58] <z1haze> I want an opinion on the cleanest way to do this: http://dpaste.com/38CTK1C
[12:06:16] <z1haze> I allow either a url or static html to be passed a dialog instance
[12:06:29] <z1haze> if its html, we dont need to fetch anything obviously, but if its a url, we need to fetch it
[12:06:35] <z1haze> is this the best way?
[12:07:04] <z1haze> so then I can just do getHtml().then(openDialog())
[12:07:06] <taplar> i don't see the html check
[12:07:13] <z1haze> because it will already be there
[12:07:20] <z1haze> the constructor requires either a url or html
[12:07:40] <taplar> but your not doing anything with it
[12:07:44] <taplar> *you're
[12:07:49] <z1haze> correct
[12:07:57] <z1haze> but I want to follow the same flow as if it was already there
[12:08:02] <z1haze> like the above example
[12:08:03] <taplar> oh wait, you're using this to load the html if it isn't there
[12:08:07] <z1haze> yes
[12:08:19] <z1haze> and I want the same fluent api for when its url vs html
[12:08:23] <taplar> seems fine
[12:08:34] <z1haze> not weird to call resolve twice?
[12:08:44] <taplar> you're not calling it twice
[12:08:54] <z1haze> well, i mean having it in there twice, basically calling resolve and doing nothing
[12:09:10] <taplar> nah.  your method is expected to return a promise
[12:09:13] <z1haze> in the else block, its basically just there because it COULD have been a url that i ned to fetch
[12:09:16] <z1haze> ok cool
[12:09:36] <taplar> but .then(openDialog())  should be .then(openDialog)
[12:10:11] <taplar> and if you wanted to you could pass the html into the resolve
[12:10:16] <z1haze> yeah that was pseudo
[12:11:16] <z1haze> its actually like this http://dpaste.com/1MD0JNZ
[12:11:23] <taplar> and if you wanted to, $.ajax({url: this.options.url}) could be $.get(this.options.url)
[12:11:34] <z1haze> oh, i like that
[12:12:10] <taplar> this looks like vue or something like that
[12:12:25] <taplar> with the $el
[12:12:32] <z1haze> its not, but I use vue a lot
[12:12:43] <z1haze> its actually just a es6 class that Im making to wrap jquery-ui
[12:12:52] <taplar> cool
[12:13:12] <z1haze> people change their mind a lot here and I wnt to have a solid interface for dialogs, and when they change to something else I just have to update it here
[12:13:33] <taplar> oh i completely understand, and i'd love it if we had time at my place to do things like that, :)
[12:16:12] <z1haze> we dont, but I just work it into tickets im working on
[12:16:30] <z1haze> i clean the area im working on basically
[12:18:20] <z1haze> taplar, here's what I have now: http://dpaste.com/243Y32W
[12:18:27] <z1haze> it would be cool if you had time to take a look
[12:20:59] <taplar> this.options.width || 'auto' <-- could 'auto' be the default value?
[12:21:14] <taplar> or are you safeguarding against bad input?
[12:21:46] <z1haze> auto is the default by itself but i open an empty dialog first the a spinner
[12:22:26] <z1haze> and im basically updating the dialog so its position updates
[12:23:10] <z1haze> when i mean default, its actually default from jquery-ui
[12:23:11] <taplar> so what happens if the get fails?
[12:23:27] <z1haze> it blows up currently - I havent handled anything yet
[12:23:56] <z1haze> honstly, I'll proabbly just close the dialog if that happens lol
[12:24:16] <taplar> that's what i was thinking.  maybe throw up a toaster or something
[12:24:31] <taplar> but it looks good, at least from my pov, :)
[12:28:04] <z1haze> would this be ok? http://dpaste.com/17K88E8
[12:29:06] <taplar> i need to look at the api, but success there seems wrong
[12:29:21] <taplar> personally i'd just use then() and provide the good and bad handlers
[12:29:25] <z1haze> and then something like this http://dpaste.com/0CNZJ2P
[12:29:32] <z1haze> we're on jq 2.2.4
[12:29:51] <taplar> 2.2.4 should have then()
[12:29:55] <taplar> it's been around a while
[12:30:43] <z1haze> maybe .done().fail()?
[12:31:17] <taplar> sure, which is short hand for .then(function, null).then(null, function)
[12:31:37] <taplar> but slightly more readable
[12:34:57] <z1haze> what sucks is that we use native promises sometimes in our code too, and it sucks having out of date jquery havint to know when i can call catch for errors and when i cant
[12:35:48] <taplar> has your team talked about upgrading?
[12:37:46] <z1haze> im sure its somewhere on the priority list
[12:38:04] <z1haze> so ive put this into action to test, and it doesnt like getHtml().then().catch()
[12:38:12] <z1haze> with returning a $.Deferred() i wonder why
[12:38:51] <taplar> api says catch is a 3x method
[12:39:13] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.catch/
[12:39:41] <z1haze> guess its done and fail again then
[12:40:15] <taplar> also now that i'm staring at this a bit I would make one small change
[12:40:27] <taplar> i would only create the deferred in the else
[12:40:55] <taplar> $.ajax and $.get already create a promise/deferred
[12:41:48] <z1haze> in getHtml()
[12:42:23] <z1haze> so I return $.get?
[12:42:36] <z1haze> and then create the promise in the else?
[12:42:41] <taplar> one sec
[12:43:17] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lq6c0gru/1/   this doesn't have the then() changes, just taking the last paste you gave
[12:44:09] <z1haze> so wouldnt I also remove lines 5 and 6?
[12:44:17] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lq6c0gru/2/
[12:44:35] <z1haze> theres no promise at this point though is there?
[12:44:44] <taplar> true
[12:44:44] <z1haze> line 5
[12:44:51] <z1haze> cant i just eliminate line 5
[12:45:06] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/Lq6c0gru/3/
[12:45:06] <taplar> so you could just pass the success method into $.get()
[12:45:10] <taplar> and do without the then()
[12:45:37] <z1haze> right, i think that is what you mean
[12:45:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lq6c0gru/4/
[12:46:08] <z1haze> ah
[12:48:45] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lq6c0gru/5/  since it is a single statement
[12:48:53] <taplar> but you might find that less readable
[13:06:28] <z1haze> does using $(this) multiple times within an event handler make multiple dom queries?
[13:07:27] <taplar> it constructs multiple jQuery objects
[13:07:34] <taplar> it wouldn't perform a lookup
[13:07:44] <taplar> unless 'this' is a string
[13:10:00] <z1haze> so would it be best to store that as a variable then?
[13:10:10] <taplar> yup
[13:21:35] <devi8> I have a string of "separator characters" that I need to split a string by, is there an easy way to do this or should I just parse character by character in the value string?
[13:21:55] <taplar> what does the string look like?
[13:22:24] <devi8> Mr. John Doe-Smith, esq.
[13:22:41] <taplar> the separator characters string i mean
[13:23:02] <devi8> So I want to split that into Mr, John, Doe-Smith, esq.
[13:25:06] <robertmaxrees> devi8 so you want to split on space?
[13:25:25] <devi8> basically, I want to enable users to enter their full name and then parse the parts...or enter the parts and compile the full name.
[13:25:46] <robertmaxrees> SO I'ma stop you there :)
[13:25:53] <robertmaxrees> because names are more complicated than that.
[13:25:56] <devi8> robertmaxrees, except that would make the last name "Doe-Smith,"
[13:26:14] <robertmaxrees> because that IS their last name, presumably.
[13:26:22] <robertmaxrees> what if they had two middle names?
[13:26:23] <devi8> no comma
[13:26:25] <robertmaxrees> or no middle name?
[13:26:35] <taplar> depending on how you do the separator characters, you could do a regexp, https://jsfiddle.net/hgca6ach/
[13:26:42] <devi8> exactly my point. For a vast majority the parsing will work great.
[13:26:50] <robertmaxrees> ^ gotta be real careful with stuff like this tho.
[13:26:56] <devi8> but before the form is submitted, it will ask if it parsed correctly.
[13:27:28] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't just leave it as a single "name" field?
[13:27:48] <taplar> i'd almost make multiple inputs
[13:28:03] <robertmaxrees> taplar but how many do you make? :)
[13:28:06] <devi8> It's for an attorney's form. They need everything spelled out but don't want people scared of 6 fields for their name.
[13:28:10] <taplar> 3 or 4
[13:28:17] <taplar> depending on if you include middle name
[13:28:30] <devi8> And saluations, honoraries, degrees, pedigrees
[13:28:35] <robertmaxrees> if it's for a legal form having all middle names is a big deal.
[13:29:03] <robertmaxrees> so title, given name, middle name(s), last name, degree(s)/pedigree(s), etc.
[13:29:09] <taplar> first name, middle name, last name, and the other thing
[13:29:47] <devi8> That's how it's done now. But the problem is that people are intimidated by it. So he asked me to do the impossible. Make it one line they can enter (without all the fields) and parse the string.
[13:29:55] <devi8> I agree with you both. Seriously
[13:29:58] <taplar> "intimidated"?
[13:30:01] <robertmaxrees> taplar but some people have multiple middle names.
[13:30:14] <devi8> Add about 5 names on a page and you have 50 fields to fill out
[13:30:16] <taplar> so?  that's just a length issue
[13:30:17] <robertmaxrees> devi8 how many people are contacting them through this form?
[13:30:34] <robertmaxrees> like, is this really a problem to solve through a website in the first place?
[13:30:40] <devi8> It's not a contact form per se. It's a form for the courts.
[13:31:48] <devi8> Not sure if you have ever worked with an attorney before (or maybe you just have more leverage than I do). They want some unreasonable things that you either have to do or quit.
[13:31:58] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware.
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> there are two other solutions here:
[13:32:23] <robertmaxrees> one would be to make it one field and have them validate/clean up before it goes onto the actual form.
[13:33:11] <robertmaxrees> the other solution is to build out something that lets people add fields based on "type" - so they start with a "first name", "last name", and "greeting".  then let them add ones for "middle name", "honorific/pedigree"
[13:33:18] <robertmaxrees> so they can build it out as they'd like.
[13:34:00] <devi8> I figured I would have one field that parsed it into the smaller fields (which should work for most), but when the parser notices something weird, it drops down the extended fields list.
[13:34:21] <devi8> which of course is toggleable manualy
[13:34:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so the issue is you're making a lot of assumptions about how names work :)
[13:34:47] <devi8> precisely
[13:34:54] <taplar> and now you have 1 extra field for all the other individual fields
[13:35:31] <robertmaxrees> since it's legal paperwork i would really encourage you do not try to parse it heh.
[13:35:37] <robertmaxrees> names are reall diverse.
[13:35:39] <robertmaxrees> *really
[13:36:12] <taplar> "you said your name was X"  "No... your stupid form wouldn't let me put in my proper name"
[13:36:20] <devi8> In order to take up less space, when the field is blurred, I'll composite the complex names into one field for display, then expand for editing. I'll copy this chat to my boss for support. I agree
[13:36:22] <taplar> "your honor"
[13:37:02] <taplar> is space really a concern when it comes to legal matters?
[13:37:09] <taplar> i'd think accuracy would be ...
[13:37:18] <devi8> Intimidation is. If it's too complex, people won't use it.
[13:37:42] <taplar> i've never seen a name input and been intimidated
[13:37:43] <robertmaxrees> a great example of where this system falls apart is an old therapist of mine.
[13:37:50] <robertmaxrees> her name was Pamela St. John
[13:37:56] <robertmaxrees> Her last name is "St. John"
[13:38:11] <robertmaxrees> Pamela St. John, mft
[13:39:17] <devi8> Precisely. So when she enters it and it parses wrong (which presumably it would look for things like St.--can't be  a middle name, and the field would be yellow. When she hits submit, it would ask if she could confirm this value. She can skip it but then it's her issue.
[13:39:46] <taplar> she has to confirm all the names entered?
[13:39:48] <robertmaxrees> and that's where your assumptions get sticky
[13:40:00] <robertmaxrees> "can't be a middle name" - according to whom?
[13:40:28] <devi8> St. has a period and two characters. That's an abbreviation. I won't accept abbreviated middle names
[13:40:29] <taplar> what about people who don't have middle names?
[13:40:45] <robertmaxrees> devi8 that doesn't mean it's an invalid middle name though.
[13:40:49] <robertmaxrees> that'
[13:41:02] <robertmaxrees> *that's what i'm saying.  some people may very well have that as a middle name.
[13:42:04] <devi8> I have a list of last-name prefixes like O' and Mac that I will parse the last names with. Regardless, there are going to be errors--and these people know that because they have faced it their entire lives.
[13:42:18] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty cold and exclusionary heh
[13:42:23] <taplar> I just don't see what's difficult/intimidating about something like: [firstname] [middlename] [lastname] [greeting] <click here to add another name row>
[13:42:41] <robertmaxrees> is somebody at least going to review these before forms go off to the court?
[13:42:55] <devi8> There are two types of honoraries, two types of pedigrees, and various professional assocations
[13:43:11] <devi8> as much as they do now
[13:43:35] <devi8> if it improves accuracey a little, it's better than the problems we have now.
[13:43:44] <devi8> accuracy..sorry
[13:44:27] <robertmaxrees> i guess i see there being a very high risk to the assumptions being made.
[13:44:38] <robertmaxrees> and would avoid doing that kind of validation.
[13:45:10] <devi8> We had one guy that was like Hon. Dr. John Doe III, esq, Phd, DDs  and you know people like this are petty about it.
[13:45:54] <taplar> fortunately i don't
[13:46:29] <devi8> dont' know or don't have that kind of name?
[13:46:40] <taplar> but *shrug* we've given our advice.  all we can do
[13:46:49] <z1haze> I am confused on how I can get the correct conext of 'this' in my scenario. I am building an options param that I pass into the constructor of my object, and one of the props in options in an 'close callback' in which i want to call this.close() on the dialog instance.. how do i make sure that the correct instance of this is used with the dialog instance runs the close clalback
[13:47:03] <devi8> I appreciate it seriously. I am hoping to use this text to prove my point. Thanks for your help.
[13:47:28] <taplar> the close callback was an arrow method, right?
[13:47:38] <z1haze> something like this http://dpaste.com/37SVZD5
[13:48:01] <z1haze> this in opts is referring to the dialog instance itself, that hasnt been created yet
[13:48:09] <taplar> what is it saying that 'this' is there?
[13:48:20] <z1haze> i dont konw
[13:48:22] <z1haze> im just asking
[13:48:29] <z1haze> should it work as is?
[13:48:29] <taplar> console.log it and see
[13:48:36] <z1haze> ok
[13:48:56] <taplar> i can't say from the scope of the code you provided
[13:49:27] <devi8> looks like php, though
[13:49:27] <taplar> if the 'this' is inside a class that is instantiated, afaik it should be that instance of the class
[13:50:04] <taplar> lots of class based languages looks similar, :)
[13:51:02] <devi8> Never seen {close: () =>this.close()}  in js before. cool.
[13:51:11] <taplar> es6
[13:51:23] <z1haze> ?
[13:51:31] <z1haze> that doesnt look like php at all haha
[13:51:39] <taplar> arrow function, it creates a method but doesn't change the context of 'this', as well as not including other things
[13:52:44] <devi8> I will never be up to speed. Looking up arrow functions in es6 now. thanks.
[13:53:12] <taplar> take note of how they are different from normal functions.  they are not necessarily meant to be a replacement
[13:53:15] <z1haze> so as I thought
[13:53:50] <z1haze> this is the link clicked
[13:53:53] <z1haze> not good
[13:55:02] <z1haze> this.close() is not a function on globa.js (the file where im creating the dialog from)
[13:55:49] <robertmaxrees> z1haze do you understand the differences between arrow functions and regular functions?
[13:56:00] <z1haze> of course
[13:56:16] <robertmaxrees> so what are the differences?
[13:56:22] <z1haze> one binds this and one doesnt
[13:56:40] <z1haze> i dont think thats my problem here, maybe ill try and see
[13:57:08] <taplar> can you show us this click logic?
[13:57:35] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:57:38] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/2X3BY0E
[13:59:08] <z1haze> either way it doesnt solve the problem, it just changes which dom element this is
[13:59:19] <z1haze> but this shouldnt be a dom element, it should be the instance of the dialog
[13:59:40] <z1haze> otherwise how can i execute close on the dialog in the close callback if I need to insert my own stuff
[13:59:41] <taplar> that's not how that works
[13:59:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:59:48] <z1haze> ^
[13:59:49] <z1haze> ^
[13:59:52] <taplar> the 'this' would only be the element, inside the element
[14:00:06] <taplar> move the const up above the options
[14:00:10] <taplar> and then use d.close()
[14:00:15] <z1haze> i understand that, which is why im asking, how can i call instance methods on the object before ive instantiated it
[14:00:25] <taplar> you wouldn't
[14:00:44] <z1haze> so i'd have to do like d.options.close = ... ?
[14:01:11] <taplar> this.close() becomes d.close()
[14:01:16] <taplar> as d is your instance you created
[14:01:23] <z1haze> right but is that how i have to update it though
[14:01:33] <z1haze> i cant move it above like you suggested
[14:01:34] <taplar> unless i'm missing something, yes
[14:01:36] <z1haze> the constructor requires the options
[14:01:39] <taplar> y not?
[14:01:46] <taplar> oh true
[14:02:05] <robertmaxrees> let's flip this on its head a little
[14:02:12] <robertmaxrees> why does the constructor need to be called in the handler?
[14:02:17] <z1haze> but i think i can do d.options.close = () => d.close()
[14:02:31] <z1haze> because its a new dialog instance
[14:03:01] <robertmaxrees> should it be though?  why not init all of them on pageload and then just call the methods for each as appropriate?
[14:03:20] <z1haze> because each one gets different options
[14:03:33] <robertmaxrees> you can still pass those on pageload instead of on click tho.
[14:03:51] <z1haze> whats a lot of work for something that might never happen
[14:03:51] <taplar> as it is, i would almost take 'this.close();' out of the options
[14:04:05] <robertmaxrees> "a lot of work" howso?
[14:04:16] <robertmaxrees> and how is that different from the issue you're having now? :)
[14:04:17] <z1haze> instantiating 10 dialogs on page load
[14:04:25] <z1haze> i might only ever use 1? who knows
[14:04:34] <robertmaxrees> are you thinking there'd be a perf issue?
[14:04:45] <z1haze> possibly
[14:04:58] <robertmaxrees> i doubt it.
[14:05:24] <z1haze> taplar, this.close isnt an option
[14:05:32] <taplar> hold on, think about it
[14:05:43] <z1haze> close is a default option in jquery-ui dialog
[14:05:43] <taplar> close should always close the modal, no?
[14:05:49] <z1haze> correct
[14:06:00] <taplar> so what you are giving it, really, is -extra- stuff to do
[14:06:04] <z1haze> but sometimes I want to do other shit in the close callback too
[14:06:07] <z1haze> correct
[14:06:13] <z1haze> not sure how to keep this.close + add my own
[14:06:25] <z1haze> because the options merge just replaces what i pass in
[14:06:25] <taplar> which could effectively be stated as function() { extrastuffgivenbytheuser();  this.close();; }
[14:06:46] <taplar> so why not just provide the extra stuff, and always do the this.close() in the class instance of the close mehtod
[14:07:11] <z1haze> i guess I wanted the user to decide completely what happens in the close function
[14:07:20] <z1haze> maybe for some reason it shouldnt close? i dunno
[14:07:46] <taplar> to me that wouldn't be a call to the close method though
[14:07:48] <z1haze> maybe they try to close something thats not ready to close, or something i really dont know currently, but I dont want to restrict it
[14:08:28] <z1haze> lets separate it
[14:08:32] <z1haze> close and close()
[14:08:48] <z1haze> my own close method is one thing, but the option for close: is something you give jquery-ui, yeah?
[14:09:09] <z1haze> so it has its own default behavior, but the default close() for the dialog just hides it
[14:09:15] <z1haze> and i want to destroy it completely.
[14:09:26] <z1haze> and fire off my own events
[14:09:32] <z1haze> hence my own close method
[14:10:26] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/  you can bind on the beforeClose, sure
[14:11:44] <z1haze> maybe thats what ill do, just do beforeclose and not mess with close
[14:12:16] <taplar> i mean, going off of the api, i don't see how you can replace their close logic
[14:12:59] <z1haze> well, it says you can
[14:13:04] <z1haze> well, not replace
[14:13:09] <z1haze> but just inject after close
[14:13:11] <z1haze> which is what close is
[14:13:34] <z1haze> their close still happens, but it just hides the modal, doesnt remove it
[14:13:51] <taplar> ok, so lets think about it this way
[14:13:57] <taplar> you got before close and after close
[14:14:11] <taplar> before close is your chance to do validations and potentially cancel the close
[14:14:37] <taplar> after close, it's too late, but you could do the destroy there
[14:14:38] <z1haze> which i wonder how id even prevent the close from happening
[14:14:43] <z1haze> right
[14:14:47] <taplar> cancel the event
[14:15:33] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-beforeClose
[14:15:37] <robertmaxrees> "Triggered when a dialog is about to close. If canceled, the dialog will not close."
[14:16:20] <z1haze> cancel by preventDefault()? what does that mean
[14:16:48] <robertmaxrees> return false;
[14:16:52] <z1haze> ah
[14:17:06] <robertmaxrees> per the SO articles on the topic :)
[14:18:11] <taplar> so what you could do is have your api allow the users to provide the logic for the before close, and specify that the method should return true/false
[14:18:24] <taplar> depending upon which on you choose for them to return, cancel the form
[14:18:32] <taplar> r/form/event/
[14:28:03] <z1haze> Im just going to use my own events and not use the jquery-ui events at all
[14:29:16] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[14:29:39] <z1haze> because they will probably change dialog libraries in a week anyway
[14:29:45] <z1haze> this way I wont have to rewrite everything
[14:30:28] <robertmaxrees> but you need to hook into the jqui events >.>
[14:30:55] <z1haze> not really
[14:31:05] <robertmaxrees> how are you going to cancel the close then?
[14:31:21] <z1haze> good point
[14:33:42] <z1haze> so question robertmaxrees would it be possible to build a wrapper around jquery ui with my own events, that could still leverage jquery-ui events
[14:34:52] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:35:29] <z1haze> does that not make sense or just difficult?
[14:35:31] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to abstract away the library from your code?
[14:35:37] <z1haze> twaq
[14:35:41] <z1haze> yes*
[14:35:43] <z1haze> exactly.
[14:35:50] <z1haze> i want to use my own
[14:36:09] <z1haze> because people change their minds so much here i dont awnt to have to fix a million places in the codebase
[14:37:02] <robertmaxrees> so 2 things: 1 - that doesn't mean you need to create a wrapper for ALL of jqui. 2 - you could abstract that stuff out, but different libraries work in different ways.
[14:37:25] <robertmaxrees> and creating an api to wrap around another api is a really... frustrating exercise.
[14:38:27] <z1haze> what if i just stored a local instance of the jquery dialog within my wrapper class, then did jqueryui.on('jquery-event' myeventhandler)
[14:39:05] <robertmaxrees> so use jqui the way it'
[14:39:11] <robertmaxrees> *it's meant to be used? :)
[14:39:31] <robertmaxrees> you can also just store a reference to the element itself.
[14:40:02] <z1haze> i just one to manage it in 1 place
[14:40:25] <z1haze> i dont want to have to go through the entire code base when they change and find all the $.dialog(.... stuff
[14:40:31] <z1haze> id rather use my wrapper so i dont have to change that, ever.
[14:40:46] <robertmaxrees> there's no guarantee your wrapper will be compatible with the new setup.
[14:40:52] <robertmaxrees> how often are they changing modal libraries?
[14:43:03] <z1haze> they make random decisions to do shit all the time man
[14:43:03] <z1haze> i dunno
[14:43:19] <robertmaxrees> do you work at this company or is it a client?
[14:43:26] <z1haze> im a contractor
[14:43:29] <z1haze> but basically i work there
[14:43:29] <robertmaxrees> 'cause I'd start pushing back and asking why it needs to change.
[14:43:47] <robertmaxrees> part of your job as a dev to is advise on technical decisions :)
[15:34:02] <Lukantos> Hi there.. I'm a bit confused right now because i found it on google this morning and currently not. I call a PHP script with .ajax() function which echoes a lot of text lines, is it possible to .append() it to a textarea after every line echoed and not only after the script has finished loading?
[15:47:11] <taplar> you have to make the request a chucked request
[15:47:17] <taplar> chunked
[15:47:57] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2481858/how-to-make-php-generate-chunked-response#14904957
[15:51:05] <Lukantos> @taplar: I do it the same way, but currently that doenst work, only shows output if finished..
[15:51:26] <Lukantos> But I should check at monday again.. too drunk now :D Have a nice weekend

[16:31:57] <robertmaxrees> i want cake.
[16:32:06] <taplar> ditto
[16:32:15] <robertmaxrees> dammit taplar
[16:32:16] <taplar> tempted to swing by a kroger
[16:39:52] <taplar> almost got one of those zebra cakes couple days ago.  didn't give in.  it's not real cake
[16:46:18] <robertmaxrees> that's an awful sham.
[16:54:29] <catbadger> hey all
[16:54:47] * catbadger is super caffinated.
[16:56:05] <taplar> hola
[18:33:45] <jef_rou> https://codepen.io/nickcil/pen/sfutl?editors=1010 - is it possible to do something like this with multiple divs with the same class in an each function?
[18:38:59] <catbadger> I'm going to say yes
[18:39:12] <catbadger> haven't looked, but it should be possible.
[19:20:22] <lewix> I was certain i could append and array
[19:20:30] <lewix> it was baked in in jquery, wasn't it?
[19:20:40] <lewix> an array of html element*
[19:24:07] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/append/#append-content-content
[19:24:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:31:03] <robertmaxrees> lewix
[19:31:59] <lewix> robertmaxrees: i had to use join('') otherwise it would understand my array of html
[19:32:31] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:32:35] <robertmaxrees> would or wouldn't?
[19:47:47] <Guest86955> can i fire multiple defer.resolve from the same defer
[19:50:42] <robertmaxrees> a defer can only resolve or reject once.
[20:00:59] <lewix> robertmaxrees: i had to
[20:01:10] <lewix>     $('#test').append(routine.join(''));
[20:01:23] <lewix> and routine is an array of strings representing html
[20:01:43] <robertmaxrees> "representing html" as in strings with markup?
[20:01:55] <lewix> example ['<ul><li>foo</li></ul>',..]
[20:02:06] <robertmaxrees> "DOM element, text node, array of elements and text nodes, HTML string, or jQuery object to insert at the end of each element in the set of matched elements."
[20:02:09] <robertmaxrees> that might be whyt.
[20:02:45] <robertmaxrees> erm
[20:02:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kLvfcj3k/
[20:03:02] <robertmaxrees> seems to work fine though.
[20:20:47] <lewix> @robertmaxrees weird, theres probably something else in play...
[20:21:19] <robertmaxrees> got an example?
[20:21:35] <robertmaxrees> and/or what happens when you do the same?
