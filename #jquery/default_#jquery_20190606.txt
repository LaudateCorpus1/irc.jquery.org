[05:51:01] <sixfingeredamish> hi!
[05:52:21] <sixfingeredamish> I'm trying to use .toggle() to show and hide elements
[05:52:48] <sixfingeredamish> However, if I start off with an element being display:none, then use .toggle() to show it, it only appears for 1 sec
[05:52:55] <sixfingeredamish> Does anyone know how to fix this?
[05:57:47] <thykka> better use classes for that
[05:58:38] <sixfingeredamish> as in use .css() to do stuff?
[05:58:50] <thykka> no, as in use actual CSS to do stuff, instead of inline styles
[05:59:24] <thykka> sixfingeredamish, also, i'm not seeing what you're describing. there must be something else in your code.. v
[05:59:26] <thykka> https://jsfiddle.net/7srvjxc6/
[06:00:53] <sixfingeredamish> https://sixfingeredamish.github.io/rambutan/
[06:01:14] <thykka> sixfingeredamish, this is what I mean with using classes for it: https://jsfiddle.net/7srvjxc6/1/
[06:01:54] <thykka> what appears for 1sec?
[06:02:25] <sixfingeredamish> right now, the window starts off being open
[06:02:34] <sixfingeredamish> if I dont want that to happen, I add display:none in css
[06:02:47] <sixfingeredamish> However, when I do that, upon toggling, it will only show for 1 sec
[06:03:11] <thykka> well can you please show that then?
[06:03:20] <sixfingeredamish> yes give me a sec
[06:03:21] <thykka> i'm not seeing any toggling on the site currently
[06:05:27] <sixfingeredamish> try now: https://sixfingeredamish.github.io/rambutan/
[06:06:33] <thykka> okay, this has nothing to do with .toggle
[06:06:44] <thykka> you are using links with an empty href
[06:06:48] <thykka> clicking on such link will reload the page
[06:07:06] <thykka> solution: don't use links, use buttons.
[06:07:16] <thykka> or use anchor links
[06:07:20] <thykka> just not blank ones
[06:08:22] <sixfingeredamish> AH OMG
[06:08:29] <sixfingeredamish> if I have non-empty links, will thinks be ok?
[06:08:39] <thykka> depends
[06:09:04] <thykka> if you're linking to another page, then the browser will load the other page, and stop executing whatever javascript you had assigned
[06:09:40] <thykka> that would be considered working as intended, but whether or not it's working for your specific use-case depends on what exactly are you planning to do
[06:10:01] <sixfingeredamish> I see. I get it now.
[06:10:03] <sixfingeredamish> Thank you so much
[06:10:08] <thykka> yw!
[06:10:57] <thykka> as a rule of thumb; if there's something on your page the user is supposed to be able to click, but the click should NOT lead to another page, use a <button>, not an <a>
[06:11:31] <sixfingeredamish> looks-wise will it affect anything?
[06:12:43] <thykka> yes, the default style of a button differs a lot from the default style of a link, but both can be customized to your heart's content via CSS
[06:36:51] * AdamPDotty does not like <a class="button"> â€¦
[06:37:32] <pavonia> <button class="link">?
[06:46:48] <thykka> you may not like it, but that's what peak efficiency looks like
[15:37:35] <Es0teric> anyone here? if so, who uses the materialize framework from google?
[15:37:46] <robertmaxrees> people are here :)_
[15:37:52] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[15:38:07] <Es0teric> my question is -- i am using this datepicker: https://materializecss.com/pickers.html i want to use the autoClose property if the user selects the date first then allow a timepicker to be instantiated... how would i go about detecting wether the date on the datepicker is selected first then closed because of it to either display the timepicker or not?
[15:38:23] <robertmaxrees> oh, not a jquery related question :| good luck heh
[15:38:31] <Es0teric> datepicker uses jquery
[15:38:36] <robertmaxrees> or are you using the jquery syntax for it?
[15:38:38] <Es0teric> i mean the datepicker in materialize
[15:38:46] <Es0teric> i am
[15:38:46] <robertmaxrees> s/syntax/plugin
[15:38:48] <robertmaxrees> alrighty.
[15:39:05] <robertmaxrees> so you just wanna know if a date was clicked?
[15:39:14] <Es0teric> yeah
[15:39:17] <robertmaxrees> vs if it the datepicker was manually closed?
[15:39:20] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[15:39:31] <Es0teric> because it has autoClose functionality if a date is picked first
[15:39:51] <Es0teric> i want to see if a user did that first to either display the timepicker within the same framework or not
[15:39:56] <robertmaxrees> my first question is why you're waiting to init the timepicker instead of using css to hide/show it
[15:40:12] <Es0teric> because the datepicker is being used to calculate an expiration date and time
[15:40:22] <Es0teric> i mean to set one
[15:40:23] <Es0teric> not calculate
[15:40:31] <robertmaxrees> but otherwise, you may need to bind your own handler that checks to see if a date was picked.
[15:40:42] <Es0teric> not a date
[15:40:44] <Es0teric> a day
[15:40:49] <robertmaxrees> same concept.
[15:40:57] <Es0teric> autoClose works when the user selects a day first instead of a month or year
[15:41:09] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any hooks within the datepicker plugin to bind to that specific event.
[15:42:10] <Es0teric> yeah so how am i supposed to check for that
[15:42:34] <robertmaxrees> bind an event listener and check if it was a day that was clicked.  if you make a sample fiddle we can play around with that idea.
[15:42:48] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm.
[15:42:53] <robertmaxrees> you're already getting help in ##javascript :)
[15:43:36] <Es0teric> yeah...
[15:43:42] <robertmaxrees> good luck! :D
[15:43:49] <Es0teric> i might make an example fiddle if they cant help me
[15:44:03] <robertmaxrees> lol they want a fiddle, too :)
[15:44:18] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!
[17:19:32] <bobloblaw_> what does this mean?
[17:19:33] <bobloblaw_> from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
[17:20:16] <robertmaxrees> are you doing some kind of ajax call?
[17:21:14] <robertmaxrees> bobloblaw_
[17:21:40] <taplar> it's gamble
[17:22:02] <bobloblaw_> yea im trying to do ajax request using google oauth
[17:24:39] <bobloblaw_> any ideas?
[17:24:53] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
[17:32:50] <nug700> This simple statement is removing elements with class "header_row": $('#inv_list_tbl').find('*').not('.header_row').remove();
[17:33:09] <taplar> k?
[17:33:31] <taplar> can you show us?
[17:33:51] <nug700> https://hastebin.com/yecavefogi.html
[17:34:29] <taplar> * is going to match things like tbody and tr, td, etc
[17:34:30] <nug700> need the whole thing?
[17:34:38] <taplar> which don't have that class.
[17:35:11] <taplar> i'd assume it's removing the tbody/thead or whatever the browser is injecting into your table
[17:35:30] <robertmaxrees> you also have invalid markup.
[17:36:18] <nug700> you mean tabs/spacing?
[17:36:39] <robertmaxrees> there's an extra closing div tag with no matchin start tag.
[17:37:24] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, the browser is autinjecting a tbody for you.
[17:37:34] <robertmaxrees> hence the break.
[17:38:02] <robertmaxrees> taplar++
[17:39:17] <taplar> if you only want to remove things from your tbody, put a thead around what you have (which makes sense as it's the header row), and then find('tbody') instead
[17:39:50] <taplar> try to avoid find('*') when possible.  Side effects like this happen if you're not careful.
[17:39:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:40:01] <robertmaxrees> or even when you ARE careful.
[17:40:05] <taplar> yeah
[17:40:16] <nug700> what do you mean by thread?
[17:40:22] <taplar> <thead>
[17:40:40] <taplar> <thead></thead><tbody></tbody>
[17:40:43] <taplar> table head, table body
[17:41:11] <nug700> ah
[17:41:52] <taplar> and if you were only using that class to try to identify which ones were header stuff, that could also be reduced potentially, :)
[17:49:26] <nug700> Don't even need the class, Just empty()'ed from the body. Thanks.
[17:50:01] <taplar> :)
