[04:09:39] <dimi1947> I downloaded jqueryUI with no theme...how can I add a theme to it(by mistake)...now...after downloading it
[04:10:51] <Cork> you can download a full theme here http://code.jquery.com/ui/
[04:10:59] <Cork> or you can create a theme in the builder again
[04:14:58] <dimi1947> As I see...it is just a css file...I have a question based on that observation...when including in an HTML filr script tagg for jueryUI do I have to include also the associatedd CSS file?
[04:15:38] <Cork> jqeury-ui _requires_ the core css, else elements have no base rules
[04:15:51] <Cork> for theming you can use one of the default themes, or write your own
[04:15:55] <Cork> but the core rules is always needed
[04:16:12] <dimi1947> got it...
[04:17:05] <Cork> the alternative would be that ui added a ton of inline style tags to every element, and that wouldn't be very well written
[04:17:32] <dimi1947> In the package I see 3-4 css files...do I have to inlude all of them(I am not referring to min)?
[04:17:54] <Cork> the none mined ones is the development files
[04:18:06] <Cork> you need the rules from them, but you don't need to have it as separate files
[04:18:18] <Cork> you can concat them or use a css min tool to compact them
[04:21:32] <dimi1947> ...I am in developing something...so I will not include min for now...let us forget for now concat them(I do not know how to do it anyway)...so the q remains...which css files to include?)
[04:23:04] <dimi1947> based on this example here I seem to need only one file
[04:23:38] <Cork> dimi1947: the theme included in the zip file you get from the builder is a combined one
[04:23:50] <Cork> if you just want the formating rules you only need core
[04:24:08] <Cork> if you want to have buttons with themed color and things like that you need a theme css too
[04:25:55] <Cork> core has functional rules like ex. a dialog need overflow: hidden and position: absolute; to work
[04:26:05] <Cork> theme is the images and icons used to style the dialog
[04:26:12] <Cork> (and border colors and so on)
[04:26:20] <dimi1947> let me put it this way...in which file are the core rules:jquery-ui.css or jquery-structure.css OR both?
[04:28:43] <Cork> i suspect it is structure, though not sure where the name comes from
[04:28:55] <Cork> this is the file https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/themes/base/base.css
[04:29:14] <Cork> while this is the theme values https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/themes/base/theme.css
[04:29:48] <Cork> the compiled version is here http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[04:30:27] <Cork> (though that one contains fallback icons and backgrounds)
[04:36:39] <dimi1947> so as I understand jquery-ui.css contains the code that is both found in base.css and theme.css
[04:37:01] <Cork> builder makes a combined file ya
[04:37:59] <dimi1947> so...in other words...with jquery-ui.css I am good to go
[04:38:18] <Cork> depends on how you want to structure your page, but ya it is one option
[04:39:05] <dimi1947> well...I just want the datepicker to be fully formated....nothing else
[04:39:51] <Cork> then ya you most likely want the jqeury-ui.css one as it doesn't contain the rules for all the other widgets if you unchecked them in the builder
[05:57:58] <crs> Ha! I think I figured out how to close that dropdown from selectize on initialized value, but Robert is not here for me to tell him. :(
[07:25:18] <Cork> crs: ya, that is quite common
[07:31:14] <crs> Cork: That Robert is not here? :)
[07:39:58] <Cork> crs: i just meant that ppl asking questions and leaving before ppl have a chance to answer happens a lot
[07:58:02] <crs> Cork: Ah, no, Robert was helping me greatly yesterday. Coulodn't figure out what was wrong - did today, so just wanted to let him know. :)
[07:58:39] <Cork> ah
[09:25:29] <grid-> hey
[10:47:55] <dimi1947> how can I acess the auto-complete values of a text input of jquery-UI?
[10:51:06] <dimi1947> I have downloaded jquery-ui and when I click in the input box a value appears exactly beneath it and I cannot undedrstand where it is coming from
[10:52:08] <dimi1947> and the funny thing is that I cannot inspect the corresponding the element cause the value disappears when I click elsewhere
[11:02:43] <dimi1947> ...but I have a suspicion that the list that appears is not autocomplete related...
[19:28:41] <Vooloo> http://jsfiddle.net/9frgj25z/14 how do I stop the page from scrolling when I expand the accordion?
[19:29:23] <robertmaxrees> remove the animate.
[19:30:35] <robertmaxrees> Vooloo
[19:33:23] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy think music
[19:48:55] <pavonia> Bzzzz... you must phrase your answer in form of a question!
[19:49:27] <robertmaxrees> always confuses my why people ask questions, get a response, and then...
[21:54:27] <relipse> I have a block of text which contains several paragraphs, how can I detect each paragraph and wrap it with a <p> tags
[22:18:28] <pavonia> relipse: How are the paragraphs separated?
[23:48:50] <pavonia> "always confuses my why people ask questions, get a response, and then..." :S
[23:55:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
