[04:52:33] <tokam> Hello
[04:52:34] <tokam> https://www.parkscanner.com/?post_type=st_cars&s=&location_id=12980&pick-up-date=28.11.2017&drop-off-date=27.12.2017&drop-off-time=22:00&pick-up-time=10:00&style=1
[04:52:57] <tokam> If you use my filters here and than after it click on: "Suche Ã¤ndern" the date picker does not work anymore.
[04:53:24] <tokam> can you give me a hint how to fix it? I also tried to modify the z-index after I used hide and show on an other window.
[04:53:30] <tokam> must I reinitialize the datepicker?
[05:06:04] <tokam> it works on a previous version :(
[05:09:44] <tokam> the bug depends on including jquery ui
[05:10:18] <tokam> when I do not include jQuery Ui, this does not occur
[16:14:48] <Katronix> Greetings all, can someone please look at: https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=FE2KpBeFhT and suggest why my script to make sure pass and pass2 matches, doesn't work?
[16:27:45] <Katronix> anyone here?
[16:36:54] <Katronix> Sorry this url: https://jsfiddle.net/xs43dghk/
[16:48:05] <Trashlord> Katronix: I only have very little experience with jQuery, but maybe instead of "name=pass" you should use "id=pass" in your <input>
[16:48:15] <Trashlord> don't know if that makes a difference to jquery
[16:55:10] <Trashlord> Katronix: yes, apparently it makes a difference. I tested a click event for an input element, using both "name" and "id", and only when using "id", did the event fire
[16:55:21] <Trashlord> Katronix: so use id instead of name in your <input> element
[16:55:35] <Trashlord> ...heh...
[22:03:02] <Scott_> Is there anyone that could point me in a direction?  I'm trying to lean jquery mobile.  When I submit a form, once I process things on my end, I want to force the page to load another page.
[22:03:30] <Scott_> the page appears to load, however, the URL in the browser seems to always be a page behind.
