[00:04:01] <djam90> Is it possible to listen for multiple events on multiple things? For example, when the document loads, AND when an input is changed?
[00:05:11] <Cork> djam90: .ready isn't an event handler but other times you can just do $([elm1, elm2]).on('event1 event2')
[00:05:26] <Cork> djam90: you could just create a named function, and use it for both calls though
[00:05:50] <Cork> function effect() {}; $(effect);$('*').on('input', effect);
[00:06:30] <sacho> djam90, those would usually be listeners on two different elements
[00:06:45] <sacho> what cork suggested is much cleaner.
[00:07:27] <Cork> sacho: about the two different elements; sure but the domcontentloaded event only fires on document and window
[00:07:33] <Cork> so shouldn't normally be a problem
[00:07:52] <djam90> Cork for example what I am trying to achieve is, I want to prefil an LI element with some text that is in a data attribute of an HTML element. I also want to change this text if the radio button changes. My current script: http://pastebin.com/JQRcvby7
[00:08:19] <sacho> Cork, you'd actually open yourself to a lot of problems if you listen for change on document without checking that it came from your particular input :P
[00:08:21] <Cork> djam90: firstly you prob want to use delegated event listener
[00:08:37] <Cork> sacho: true
[00:08:54] <djam90> my current code that I just pasted will work, but it seems long winded?
[00:09:00] <Cork> djam90: and you could just do something like $('input').trigger('change');
[00:09:18] <djam90> Cork that is a good point
[00:09:39] <djam90> Is that what you would do with this code?
[00:10:08] <Cork> djam90: possibly
[00:10:22] <Cork> djam90: i would most likely switch to the input event too
[00:10:32] <Cork> making the form feel more responsive
[00:11:01] <djam90> Cork why would you use the input event over the change event?
[00:11:18] <Cork> djam90: change on an input field fires on blur
[00:11:24] <Cork> input fires on keystrokes
[00:11:35] <djam90> got it! thanks
[00:11:51] <Cork> (and paste)
[00:18:12] <djam90> Cork I am working with radio buttons. This is my code: http://pastebin.com/9wiuQ7Hp   It works when the document loads, but when I click a radio button it does nothing at all
[00:18:33] <Cork> djam90: ah
[00:18:44] <Cork> ya, radio and checkbox doesn't work with the input event
[00:18:52] <djam90> ah!
[00:18:53] <Cork> you need to use click or change there
[00:19:18] <djam90> Awesome that works, thanks
[00:19:23] <djam90> gonna write that stuff down
[00:29:57] <calamity> hey, I'm trying to get the src of an iframe, but for some reason that's printing out the URL of the parent page
[00:30:16] <Cork> ?paste
[00:30:16] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:36:21] <djam90> If I have: var boxes = $('.service-checkbox');    how can I get the checked ones, using that variable? Like, I want:   boxes:checked. Would it be boxes.find(':checked')? or what
[00:36:42] <djam90> I know I can do $(".service-checkbox:checked")  but I want to use the initial variable I created
[00:36:44] <Lope> howcome when I put a $ or jQuery in the console I get jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[283] ?
[00:36:55] <Cork> djam90: .filter
[00:37:13] <djam90> ok I will read up on it, thanks
[00:37:52] <Cork> Lope: that does look strange
[00:38:11] <djam90> awesome thanks Cork
[00:38:14] <djam90> that works
[00:38:57] <Lope> cork. jQuery('.class') just gives me an empty array. perhaps jQuery isn't loaded at all and chrome is just humoring me.
[00:39:29] <Cork> Lope: what does $.fn.jquery give you?
[00:41:29] <Lope> oh. 1.7.1
[00:41:44] <Cork> then no jquery is loaded
[00:42:12] <Lope> I can see that 1.7.1 jQuery is loaded in the source though, and $.fn.jquery returns 1.7.1
[00:42:39] <Lope> but if I type $('div') in the console, I get jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[283]
[00:42:55] <Cork> and same with jQuery('div') ?
[00:43:43] <Lope> Same yes. But it is an array with all the div elements.
[00:43:53] <Lope> Maybe it's just how chrome that displays it that I'm not used to.
[00:44:03] <Cork> ok, so you hit the console $
[00:44:06] <Lope> because I can click the right arrow and browse through the array.
[00:44:16] <Cork> most consoles map $ to document.getElementById
[00:44:31] <Cork> just do $ = window.jQuery to get around that
[00:44:42] <Lope> function ( selector, context ) { /* The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced' */ return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context, rootjQuery ); }
[00:46:09] <Lope> Ok, it seems like it's working. will try grab the elements I need again
[00:46:12] <Lope> thanks for the help
[00:49:38] <HamMan> Hi can I get some help with this ? http://jsfiddle.net/0go4c2gf/
[00:50:01] <Cork> ?ask
[00:50:02] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:52:46] <Lope> is there any way to specify OR in a selector? $('div.(a|b) span')
[00:53:20] <sacho> div.a span, div.b span
[00:53:43] <HamMan> My apologies, I am looking for a way to load images that are given in a data-attr array. As well as make it load the next value in the array on the click of a button.  You can see a more detailed explanation/attempt in the following fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/0go4c2gf/
[00:54:22] <Lope> sacho: thanks :)
[00:56:18] <Cork> HamMan: your code has A LOT of invalid lines
[00:56:39] <Cork> HamMan: but you can access the data-images with $(this).data('images')
[00:56:57] <Cork> HamMan: if you can change the format the server use, i would recommend switching to json
[00:57:07] <Cork> that would make .data() parse the content into an array automatically
[00:59:02] <HamMan> I have some control on the format yeah. The question is what format would I require the server to return it in ?
[00:59:10] <Cork> json
[00:59:26] <Cork> meaning ["","","",""]
[00:59:47] <Cork> don't forget to entity encode the "" string though
[01:00:05] <HamMan> That's what I needed to know. I'm still creating the prototype with fluff data atm
[01:00:39] <Cork> HamMan: <button data-images="[&#x22;1&#x22;,&#x22;2&#x22;,&#x22;3&#x22;,&#x22;4&#x22;]"></button>
[01:00:54] <Cork> $('button').data('images') == ["1", "2", "3"]
[01:01:09] <Uhkis> my eyes
[01:01:11] <Cork> :)
[01:02:19] <Cork> Uhkis: <button data-images="[&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;]"></button>
[01:02:22] <Cork> better? :D
[01:02:32] <Uhkis> the horror
[01:02:36] <Cork> lol
[01:17:31] <HamMan> Oh yeah kinda forgot but thank you Cork.
[01:17:56] <Cork> HamMan: np
[01:33:30] <mooncup> does anyone know of a plugin like datatables, but for divs?
[02:04:52] <krambiorix> hi, how can i replace the whole html document and trigger CSS and Jquery ?
[02:05:32] <Cork> krambiorix: window.location = 'url'
[02:06:03] <Woet> krambiorix: what are you actually trying to do?
[02:06:35] <krambiorix> Woet, i perform an ajax request and i get the updated html back
[02:08:04] <Cork> krambiorix: don't make the request ajax if you get a full page back
[02:08:30] <Cork> ajax is meant for inplace updates of parts of the page
[02:08:35] <Cork> not full page replacements
[02:44:35] <Axy> how can I console log an object? I mean when I console.log an object it shows as [object Object] in the google console. How can I log it in an expandable way?
[02:45:05] <imolorhe> console.log() should work
[02:45:50] <imolorhe> unless you are concatenating it with a string, in which case it will display that
[02:45:51] <jikuja> *sigh* I just finished my first plugin. It's awful and 90% must be rewritten:P
[03:12:29] <jikuja> Any good sources how to develop non-traditional plugins? (Changing tags of the elements, deleting elements, using callbacks instead of chaining)
[03:25:05] * CssNoob good evening y'all
[04:18:41] <caraconan> Hi there. I was wondering if it's possible through jquery or javascript to make a JQM collapsible widget (http://api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible/) to expand up instead of down. Thanks
[04:19:21] <Mement> This code - http://paste.ofcode.org/CKh9KX97C9hpsSyyq9bfUk - controls a modal. How can I prevent the modal from closing when it reaches line 25 or line 28? I have read about e.preventDefault(), but don't know where to place it in this code.
[04:22:57] <sacho> well, find out what return value you would need to pass in the modal's documentation
[04:28:40] <calamity> What's the correct syntax and method if I want to find the text between <font class="some unique classes">Discover Sailing - Free </font> ?
[04:30:23] <sacho> calamity, http://api.jquery.com/text/
[04:30:52] <calamity> god I am so slow
[04:31:02] <calamity> I've used that a million times but forgot it existed today
[04:31:05] <calamity> thanks haha
[04:33:46] <calamity> sacho, okay actually better question.
[04:34:32] <calamity> what if I wanted to find something like this: Name:<em>this Data Is What I Want</em>
[04:37:17] <Cork> calamity: $('em').filter(function() { return $(this).text() == 'this Data Is What I Want'; });
[04:38:08] <calamity> Cork, in this situation I don't know what the text is though, I just want whatever it after Name:<em> and before the next </em>
[04:38:31] <Cork> calamity: dom isn't built for doing that
[04:38:31] <sacho> $('em').text()
[04:38:48] <Cork> wouldn't work if you want the <em> tag
[04:38:50] <calamity> sacho it's not the only em...
[04:38:57] <sacho> so select the specific em you want
[04:39:12] <calamity> Cork nah I don't want the em tag.
[04:39:22] <calamity> sacho, there's multiple em tags that have the same classes.
[04:39:23] <Cork> and you can't easily select em based on what text is directly before it
[04:39:37] <sacho> calamity, ok.
[04:39:43] <Cork> calamity: what you should do is add classes to the element you want to select
[04:39:58] <Cork> calamity: css doesn't have a good way for selecting based on content
[04:40:03] <calamity> not possible in this situation.
[04:40:25] <Cork> calamity: then .html() the parent and //.exec() is your best bet
[04:40:28] <calamity> that's alright I'll see if I can maybe find something unique and just... keep selecting the one after it or something..
[04:40:38] <calamity> Cork, hmm fair. dunno if I've used exec before
[04:40:57] <Cork> calamity: bascially serializing the dom to html and parsing it with regex
[04:41:06] <Cork> i strongly recommend AGAINST doing that though
[04:41:15] <calamity> :(
[04:41:25] <calamity> for security reasons or just because it's dumb?
[04:41:41] <sacho> it's dumb. Which is why you should use .text() instead.
[04:41:57] <Cork> sacho: text isn't one bit better
[04:42:03] <sacho> sure it is.
[04:42:13] <sacho> matching text is what regex are built for.
[04:42:19] <Cork> no cause you are still serializing the dom to find elements
[04:42:27] <Cork> html is still just text
[04:42:34] <Cork> that isn't the problem
[04:42:35] <calamity> sacho, wait how does .text() actually help in this situation?
[04:42:43] <Cork> it doesn't
[04:42:58] <Cork> .text() is the same as .html(), except it filters out the element tags
[04:43:01] <sacho> $('em').filter(function () { return $(this).parent().text().indexOf('Name:') === 0 })
[04:43:12] <Cork> O_o'
[04:43:23] <Cork> sacho: how is that a solution?
[04:43:37] <Cork> you still won't find what em to select
[04:44:07] <sacho> of course you will. You would select the one whose parent has a Name: text node at the start.
[04:44:48] <Cork> sacho: <div>title:<em>something</em><br>name:<em>something else</em></div>
[04:44:53] <Cork> will return the first one
[04:44:57] <Cork> or the second one
[04:44:59] * sacho sighs
[04:45:04] <sacho> Selectors are a specific thing, Cork
[04:45:15] <sacho> of course you can give counterexamples when you change the page content arbitrarily
[04:45:17] <Cork> all you check is if name exists inside the parent
[04:45:33] <sacho> so? you can check for what you want in particular.
[04:45:48] <sacho> I'm not going to sit down and write a selector to satisfy you based on a page I can't even see.
[04:45:49] <Cork> sacho: he wants the content of the em element following Name:
[04:46:05] <sacho> That's still possible to match.
[04:46:06] <Cork> not any em element inside a parent with the text Name: in it
[04:46:21] <calamity> there will definitely only be one match to it.
[04:46:37] <Cork> anyway either way this is a bad idea
[04:46:57] <Cork> and you really should try to get the content fixed
[04:47:28] <calamity> entirely not possible at this point, but yes, I agree.
[04:47:32] <Cork> calamity: an option you could do is use nodes instead of elements
[04:47:39] <Cork> and check for a text node with Name: in it
[04:47:43] <Cork> and grab the following node
[04:47:48] <Cork> that would be the em node
[04:47:57] <calamity> alright. that sounds useful.
[04:48:06] <Cork> but then you can't really use selectors or jquery to help you

[04:49:53] <calamity> Cork. oh. less useful...
[04:49:54] <Cork> calamity: check the node list and see if the type is a text node
[04:50:15] <Cork> if the node is a text node and contains Name: grab the next element in the list
[04:50:20] <Cork> that would be the em node
[04:50:55] <Cork> calamity: well what you want to do is breaking how things is meant to be done, so that means you will have to struggle a bit to do it
[04:51:02] <calamity> yeah that's fair.
[05:33:17] <satinez> hello can i ask some jquery things here? or how you handle it here?
[05:36:17] <sacho> just ask
[06:03:27] <Grundell> Hello, i wondered if its possible to take a value from a php valuable <?php $my_value = 422 ?> and pop in to a javascript
[06:03:57] <satinez> nice question...
[06:04:50] <Grundell> mhm
[06:05:37] <satinez> i think its possible, take a var, but i think u need it interactive..
[06:05:38] <Mizpah> Morning folks - firstly am not a jquery dev, but am hoping for some troubleshooting steps. An image tool (cloud zoom) was / is running perfectly on jquery 1.5. We have had to update the site to 1.8.x (stripe.js requirement), I cant seem to generate an error in the console, but the image zoom function is no longer responsive.  I have however found this: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12474
[06:05:38] <sacho> Grundell, see json_encode
[06:06:02] <Mizpah> How do I in the first instance try to generate an error of some form so I can track what is (or is not) happening?
[06:06:20] <Cork> Grundell: you have to one way or another stor and submit the value from server side to client side
[06:06:24] <sacho> Grundell, once you serialize your variable with json_encode, the question is introducing it. Usually your javascript code has some sort of "starting point", you could add it there
[06:06:35] <Cork> Grundell: i often do it as a data- attribute on a dom element
[06:06:44] <Cork> but you can do it as a javascript variable too
[06:07:14] <AcidRain2012> can anyone here help me with php's simple dom parser?
[06:07:31] <Cork> AcidRain2012: => ##php
[06:07:44] <AcidRain2012> they said they wouldnt help me there cause its not php related
[06:07:59] <Cork> help with the php parser isn't php related??
[06:08:16] <AcidRain2012> eh. u know how those assholes are
[06:08:22] <Cork> ya... i do
[06:08:35] <Cork> sounds like a new php channel really need to be started
[06:08:54] <maZtah> how to redirect and keep all current parameters (query string)
[06:08:58] <AcidRain2012> ye. u should be admin of it :)
[06:09:16] <Cork> heh, except i don't do very much php now days
[06:09:38] <Cork> just some simple changes on a fairly static startpage (without cms)
[06:09:46] <AcidRain2012> maZtah, sounds like u want a front controller?
[06:10:02] <maZtah> AcidRain2012: what do you mean with front controller?
[06:10:15] <AcidRain2012> maZtah, also, u could just reset all of the query string variables by looping through them, then build a url, and redirect to it
[06:10:17] <Cork> maZtah: some redirects isn't allowed to keep parameters
[06:10:29] <Cork> redirecting a post more specifically
[06:10:44] <maZtah> well, what i mean with redirect is just a window.location
[06:10:50] <maZtah> (on change of a select box)
[06:10:55] <AcidRain2012> i thought query string was refering to $_GET data only ;p
[06:11:03] <Cork> AcidRain2012: this is jquery not php
[06:11:10] <Cork> so... your answers doesn't apply
[06:11:23] <Cork> maZtah: you can get the query string from window.location.search
[06:11:25] <AcidRain2012> oh, my bad ur right
[06:11:27] <Cork> it might give you what you need
[06:11:31] <AcidRain2012> thx for not being an asshole about it :)
[06:12:01] <Cork> AcidRain2012: i generally try not to be one
[06:12:07] <maZtah> there isn't a way to just preserve the query parameters?
[06:12:22] <Cork> maZtah: they are part of the url
[06:12:33] <Cork> if you replace the url you would have to transfer them over
[06:12:44] <Grundell> Cork - sacho: So looked at json_encode. but i don't understand how i fetch that value in to my php code
[06:12:58] <Cork> maZtah: it shouldn't be much harder then window.location = newUrl + '?' window.location.search
[06:13:03] <zlude> Hello! How can i change background color on click div and when click out div back to original color?
[06:13:16] <Cork> Grundell: fetch?
[06:13:26] <AcidRain2012> Grundell, im pretty sure you cannot put client side data into php, then again, im no expert
[06:13:31] <Cork> Grundell: you have the variable in php, then you serialize it to json with that function
[06:13:42] <Cork> Grundell: and echo it into the response you send to the browser
[06:13:51] <Cork> in the html, or js depending on how you want to do it
[06:13:53] <AcidRain2012> ye thats a nice way to get it done
[06:14:03] <Cork> (i normally forbid server code from generating dynamic js)
[06:14:41] <Grundell> okay. the thing is that i want to be able to just but in a GA tracking code from WP admin into the javascript code in the header
[06:14:46] <Cork> Grundell: so i would recommend doing something like <head data-options="<?php echo json_encode(); ?>">
[06:14:55] <zlude> Hello! How can i change background color on click div and when click out div back to original color?
[06:15:17] <Cork> and then do $('head').data('options')
[06:15:43] <Cork> zlude: you could do that with plain css
[06:15:46] <Grundell> Okay, is that legit though ?
[06:15:56] <Cork> Grundell: sure it is
[06:16:14] <Cork> data-<what ever you like>="" is specified in the html spec
[06:16:22] <Cork> as a reserved namespace for website developers
[06:18:48] <Ghuyi> Hi Guys!!
[06:24:34] <Lope> how can I ask for .val() if the object is a input tag, or .text() if it's something else?
[06:25:06] <ndeeah> hi guys, i have a parallax website, I dont want the user to be able to freely scroll. basically what i want is that whenever he scrolls a bit to the bottom, it automatically scrolls the whole page down so he sees the full next page. first step was making everything fixed, and making a vertical carousel that i manipulate the css property "top" so that it
[06:25:06] <ndeeah> scrolls from page to page. however, now that i disabled the scrolling using position fixed, how can i know if the user scrolled? $(window).scroll() doesn't seem to work
[06:25:24] <Cork> Lope: ($(this).is(':input') ? $(this).val() : $(this).text())
[06:26:36] <ndeeah> http://jsfiddle.net/16yazo2L/ this is basically it
[06:26:36] <mooncup> >he scrolls a bit to the bottom, it automatically scrolls the whole page down so he sees the full next page.
[06:26:42] <mooncup> why is every site like this nowadays?
[06:26:46] <mooncup> I really don't like it :(
[06:26:53] <ndeeah> i want any small scroll on the .page1 to take it directly to the page below it
[06:26:59] <Cork> mooncup: it's the new cool thing
[06:27:03] <ndeeah> mooncup: when u work with designers and they ask for this, u cant really complain :p
[06:27:13] <ndeeah> mooncup: wouldn't have done this this way if it were up to me
[06:27:31] <Cork> mooncup: take it easy, give it a month or two and a new "cool must use" will come and paralax will be sooo yesterday :)
[06:27:41] <mooncup> I hope so
[06:27:43] <mooncup> it really annoys me
[06:27:44] <Cork> heh
[06:27:59] <Cork> it's been like that for about as long as i've done web development
[06:28:10] <Cork> and i don't think it will change anytime soon
[06:28:26] <Cork> (tables for design anyone? :D)
[06:29:00] <mooncup> tables have returned though
[06:29:04] <mooncup> in spirit at least
[06:29:09] <mooncup> bootstrap is basically tables
[06:29:21] <Cork> not for basic layout
[06:29:45] <Cork> sure some sites still use it, but it is normally frowned uppon now days
[06:29:53] <Cork> (and rightfully so)
[06:29:57] <mooncup> I meant the way it works
[06:30:02] <mooncup> it's not using actual tables
[06:30:11] <mooncup> but it's still columns/rows :P
[06:30:18] <ndeeah> no help for this :(?
[06:30:33] <Cork> that isn't the problem with tables though
[06:31:01] <Lope> Cork: thanks
[06:31:13] <mooncup> true
[06:32:21] <Ghuyi> I have a problem because when I add a icon at button tag the event area only takes the top side
[06:32:40] <zlude> Cork, how?
[06:33:11] <mooncup> is there an equivalent of datatables that will work with divs?
[06:33:24] <Ghuyi> I have this :: <button type="button" class="roundFile" id="upld"><span class="icon-upload"></span></button>
[06:33:27] <mooncup> or groups of divs to be more specific
[06:33:32] <Ghuyi> someone know why happen this?
[06:46:48] <rfish> hey, when I call exitFullScreen in chrome, I lose the ability to scroll on my page
[06:47:02] <rfish> anyone know if this is a known issue?
[07:17:30] <jb> could someone tell me why my selector for #addSshkey (a form element) is not working here?  http://pastie.org/9727894
[07:17:50] <andrewrota> There are two elements with that same ID
[07:18:09] <jb> doh, thats it.
[07:19:33] <jb> hm, still not working after I changed the form's id.
[07:20:32] <jb> andrewrota: http://pastie.org/9727902
[07:21:02] <Cork> jb: you changed the name, not the id
[07:21:17] <jb> sorry, that was a mispaste.
[07:21:42] <jb> Cork: <form id="addnewkey" class="form-horizontal" method="post">
[07:21:50] <Lope> is this very inefficient jquery? to run this on every element returned (40 elements)? .parents('td').children('a').children('span').not('.headingButton').text();
[07:22:08] <Cork> jb: reproduce the problem in jsfiddle please
[07:22:23] <jb> Cork: sure, one min.
[07:22:30] <Cork> Lope: yes
[07:22:53] <Lope> cork, so I should rather go top > down
[07:23:07] <Cork> Lope: what you want is .closest('td').find('> a > span:not(.headingButton)')
[07:23:09] <Lope> find the headings, then find the children, knowing the headings
[07:24:10] <null--> i have a problem with resizing a rotated element in a fixed containment
[07:24:10] <Cork> Lope: many mistatenly use parents when what they want is closest
[07:24:40] <Cork> Lope: and .children() with selectors have to loop and do the filtering in js
[07:24:57] <null--> when i turned it by 90° degrees and then i resize it, i can resie it out of the containement and the element gets draggable for some reason
[07:25:04] <Cork> while the find string can use the browsers css parser
[07:27:45] <Lope> okay
[07:29:47] <Lope> corky: .parents('td').children('a').children('span').not('.headingButton').text() takes 2ms on my computer. so running it 40 times is 80ms. I find that acceptable.
[07:30:04] <Cork> Lope: uh, ok?
[07:30:20] <Cork> 1. the code is messy to read AND slower then the code i gave you
[07:30:22] <Cork> why use it?
[07:30:47] <Cork> Lope: parents return all parents
[07:31:10] <Cork> many use it cause they don't understand that it is what closest is meant for
[07:31:22] <Cork> and get buggy code as a consequence
[07:32:06] <Lope> I tried closest, but it looked like it was finding children?
[07:32:27] <Cork> uh..
[07:32:34] <Lope> if I swap parents with closest, the code doesn't work
[07:32:43] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com closest
[07:32:56] <b-ot> Cork: .closest() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[07:33:01] <Cork> Lope: read that ^
[07:33:41] <Lope> Cork, oh, great :)
[07:34:29] <Lope> oh, you know what the problem is, there are 2 nested tds that my element is inside.
[07:34:33] <Lope> that's why closest didn't work.
[07:34:39] <Lope> So I'd have to run closest twice
[07:34:55] <Cork> or rather that is why parents gives an effect you didn't expected
[07:35:07] <Cork> you search a wider area then you intended to do
[07:35:14] <Lope> okay, this works: .closest('table').closest('td').children('a').children('span').not('.headingButton').text();
[07:35:19] <Cork> ...
[07:35:25] <Cork> man stop with the children already....
[07:35:41] <Cork> why are you over complicating things so much?
[07:36:12] <Cork> also add some classes to the elements if you need to target them
[07:36:18] <Cork> makes selectors MUCH simpler
[07:36:23] <Lope> okay will do your other way
[07:36:50] <Cork> .closest('.top').find('.target:not(.headingButton)')
[07:36:50] <jb> Cork: is there a way to see console.log's in jfiddle?
[07:37:03] <Cork> jb: should work just fine
[07:37:11] <Cork> at least it does for me
[07:37:34] <Lope> Cork: but when I run this it takes a long time to return: about 1000ms at least it seems .closest('table').closest('td').find('> a')
[07:37:48] <Cork> uh
[07:38:10] <jb> Cork: I can use $('form').submit(function(event) to select the <form>, but if I change 'form' to #id, it just doesn't select.
[07:38:20] <jb> Cork: I know this is something stupid.
[07:38:25] <Cork> Lope: you should learn to construct efficient selectors
[07:38:38] <Cork> and how css relation works
[07:38:52] <Lope> cork: oh, it only takes long to display. but if I store it in a variable, it's quick.
[07:38:57] <Lope> Cork, thanks
[07:39:11] <Cork> Lope: cause every time i give you a selector you break it and make it slow...
[07:39:34] <jimi_> how can i find elements that have name="foo[]" ? i am getting errors w/ my selector
[07:39:53] <Cork> jimi_: $('input[name="foo[]"]')
[07:40:12] <Cork> always, always, always quote your attribute values in selectors
[07:40:35] <Lope> cork: this is working, but I want only the first span, how can I get that? .closest('table').closest('td').find('>a>span')
[07:41:00] <Cork> Lope: please stop hacking and slashing and start thinking about what you are doing
[07:41:28] <jimi_> Cork, ty :)
[07:41:51] <Lope> Cork: I hear you, less selectors is better. closest is better than parents.
[07:42:06] <Cork> Lope: far from the point i try to make
[07:42:26] <jimi_> Cork, i could do something like this $('#form_id').find('input[name="foo[]"]'), to get only those that match that are children of that particular form
[07:42:51] <Cork> jimi_: well not just children but in the childtree
[07:42:56] <jimi_> ya
[07:43:03] <Cork> and yes
[07:43:56] <Lope> Cork: I've observed all of your points, there are no classes that I can target.
[07:44:12] <Cork> Lope: so fix the html
[07:44:18] <Lope> Cork: I appreciate your help, thanks. It's not my html
[07:44:26] <Cork> also use a selector so you don't have to use multiple closest
[07:45:19] <Lope> Cork: I don't see a way, it's two nested tables, with no classes on anything.
[07:45:43] <Cork> Lope: you don't really give anyone else a chance to show you either
[07:46:34] <Lope> I've tried out your suggestions?
[07:46:55] <Cork> and my suggestions is wild shots in the dark
[07:46:56] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  Looking for the most active plugin project for touch events.
[07:47:01] <Cork> you've given me nothing to go on
[07:47:24] <jb> Cork: sorry, not having much luck with fiddler.  this is a more basic example.  I'm simply trying to select the form.  http://pastie.org/9727967  any idea?
[07:47:51] <Lope> Cork: I've simplified it down to this: .closest('table').closest('td').find('>a>span:first')
[07:48:12] <bengalo> Lope i think he means paste/bin it somewhere ;)
[07:48:27] <Mizpah> ok, trying this one again:
[07:48:34] <Mizpah> Morning folks - firstly am not a jquery dev, but am hoping for some troubleshooting steps. An image tool (cloud zoom) was / is running perfectly on jquery 1.5. We have had to update the site to 1.8.x (stripe.js requirement), I cant seem to generate an error in the console, but the image zoom function is no longer responsive.  I have however found this: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12474
[07:48:39] <Mizpah> How do I in the first instance try to generate an error of some form so I can track what is (or is not) happening?
[07:48:40] <Lope> bengalo: oh. I see. I just realized if I grab the div, then I don't need multiple closest.
[07:49:13] <Cork> jb: http://jsfiddle.net/hfnr85pw/
[07:49:15] <Cork> works fine here
[07:49:32] <Cork> (zero change just copied your code over to jsfiddle)
[07:49:48] <jb> Cork: ok, stupid question, but how do you know it is working?  What shows you that it was selected?
[07:50:20] <Cork> 16:50:02.366 "selected!"    show: 27:8
[07:53:23] <mooncup> just wrote a custom sorter
[07:53:26] <mooncup> seems to be working nicely :D
[07:55:34] <jb> Cork: hrmf, there must be something else on my page that is interfering then.  I'll keep looking.
[08:01:36] <Cork> jb: i suspect you have another place with the same id
[08:06:54] <jb> Cork: I don't.. I'm even trying random ID's.
[08:07:19] <Cork> jb: are you adding the form through ex. ajax?
[08:07:24] <Mizpah> ok, just confirmed it again - if I switch back to JS 1.5 it works. Is there any way from a chrome console of getting some output? Its odd that when its on 1.8 I dont even see an error?
[08:08:15] <jb> Cork: yeah, here is the entire file:  http://pastie.org/9728011
[08:08:37] <Cork> jb: ok, $('') searches the dom for the elements matching your selector
[08:08:46] <Cork> .click then loops those elements and adds an event listener
[08:08:47] <jb> Cork: i'm using #abc here.
[08:09:03] <Cork> if the elements aren't in the dom when the selector runs
[08:09:11] <Cork> there is no element to loop
[08:09:16] <Cork> so no event handlers are added
[08:09:26] <Cork> you have to delegate the event handler to a static parent
[08:09:36] <jb> Cork: hm, so 'form' works, but '#class' does not, though.
[08:09:36] <Cork> that exist when the selector runs
[08:09:48] <Cork> no
[08:09:56] <Cork> if the form is added through ajax
[08:10:00] <Cork> what selector you use doesn't matter
[08:10:20] <jb> Cork: well, the form is there, it's not added by AJAX.. i'm trying to select it to pass form data through AJAX.
[08:10:46] <Cork> Cork: yeah, here is <-- you said it was...
[08:11:02] <jb> sorry, misunderstood.
[08:11:24] <Cork> jb: also don't mix the js in with the html
[08:11:40] <Cork> either have it in head or at the absolute end of body (right before the </body> tag)
[08:12:01] <jb> Cork: ok.
[08:12:19] <ndeeah> Hi guys, im using CrSpline to guide a div into a motion paths, is there a way to "draw" the motion path and not manually input every coordinate?
[08:12:50] <gremlyn> does anyone know if the html validation event occurs outside/before/separately from the .submit() event?
[08:13:35] <gremlyn> I'm trying to catch the vlaidation stuff on submit and do stuff with the errors, but my .submit doesn't fire before all the invalid form control errors pop up in my console
[08:15:40] <drager> I'm trying to implement "long polling", do I need anything at the server-side except push data?
[08:16:11] <NoiseEee> drager: its 2014, almost 2015. why are you doing 'long polling'
[08:16:27] <drager> NoiseEee: School project and we need to use it…
[08:16:42] <NoiseEee> drager: you should be using a websockets library that has long-polling as a built in backup
[08:16:50] <drager> Yeah
[08:16:51] <gremlyn> would .submit have an issue working if the submit button is hidden on page load and shown later?
[08:16:55] <NoiseEee> drager: oh, drag.
[08:18:01] <NoiseEee> drager: so yes, just have the server ready to push/update data
[08:19:35] <jb> Cork: ok, I moved it all before </body>.
[08:19:35] <drager> NoiseEee: Yeah, if someone requests a url it returns json.
[08:20:32] <jb> Cork: see anything else standing out that could cause the problem?
[08:42:36] <bobsaccamano> hi all..I am unable to load jquery on my SSL-served page, even though I am using the url form //<cdn-path-to-jquery> Any idea what might be wrong?
[08:43:24] <BillCriswell> bobsaccamano: Does the cdn path have https available?
[08:47:35] <bobsaccamano> BillCriswell: yes
[08:47:39] <bobsaccamano> https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.11.0.min.js
[08:48:09] <BillCriswell> bobsaccamano: Are you sure you typed script and src right? <script src="//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>
[08:48:27] <BillCriswell> I've put href on script more times than I care to remember.
[08:50:10] <BillCriswell> bobsaccamano: If that's not the case open up devtools and look at the network panel and make sure it's coming through.
[08:51:54] <bobsaccamano> BillCriswell: the tag is correct. But I dont see it in sources..
[08:52:00] <bobsaccamano> in the devtools panel
[08:52:21] <bobsaccamano> in fact I have two versions...with and without CDN. Both are not visible!
[08:53:01] <BillCriswell> Have an no script extension or some shit like that? Try it in an Incognito window.
[08:53:19] <bobsaccamano> BillCriswell: am doing precisely that :)
[08:53:34] <bobsaccamano> the problem is..I'm forced to use IIS..and I know jack about it
[08:54:08] <BillCriswell> Yeah.. using tools that I have no idea what to do with is sadly a huge part of my job lately.
[08:54:18] <bobsaccamano> we have site-wide SSL enabled...so had to change all external links to the relative URL format //
[08:54:48] <BillCriswell> bobsaccamano: Is there any errors in the console at all?
[08:57:35] <bobsaccamano> BillCriswell: my bad..yes there are. The page is using <link href.. for scripts and fonts
[08:58:06] <BillCriswell> <link src="foo.js"> ?
[08:58:28] <bobsaccamano> yes..also for fonts
[08:58:53] <bobsaccamano> garbage in..garbage out
[08:58:56] <BillCriswell> Haha
[09:08:13] <kewvoq> Hi everyone, im new to jquery. how would one go about reading an objects property? im trying to console.log startDelay, but not sure how to do it: http://pastebin.com/srEiAxsF
[09:15:56] <robertmaxrees> store the value in a variable instead and read that.
[09:18:21] <kewvoq> robertmaxrees: i cant really do that because .typed is from a .js library
[09:18:37] <cjohnson> the solution they gave you in ##javascript is still the only one
[09:18:44] <cjohnson> fork the lib basically
[09:19:01] <cjohnson> you have to modify the code unless .typed allows you access to its settings
[09:19:31] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:19:49] <robertmaxrees> or just declare a variable and use that in various places.  dunno why that's not feasible.
[09:19:50] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[09:19:59] <kewvoq> cjohnson: is there a a way to check whether .typed allows read access?
[09:20:02] <cjohnson> the code he pasted is in third party code
[09:20:05] <cjohnson> kewvoq: read API
[09:20:31] <colin_> hello~
[09:20:34] <robertmaxrees> i thought he was initializing the typed plugin himself.  carry on then.
[09:21:14] <colin_> any one familiar with jquery.validator?
[09:21:21] <cjohnson> sure colin_ ask your question
[09:21:34] <kewvoq> it doesnt say anything about read access
[09:22:02] <colin_> i want to user remote to check the filed is unique. seems not work..
[09:22:33] <cjohnson> what doesn't work about it colin_?
[09:23:32] <cjohnson> kewvoq: yeah I don't see anything in the Typed.js code/API that suggests the settings are readable
[09:23:44] <cjohnson> so you'll have to change the code in what you pasted to store the settings in another variable
[09:23:58] <cjohnson> which I believe you said is third party code. thus, the solution is to fork it
[09:24:25] <colin_> <cjohnson> : if the server return false,  it did not add any error message
[09:25:37] <kewvoq> cjohnson: ahh okay i understand now, thanks!
[09:27:42] <cjohnson> colin_: fiddle?
[09:29:13] <colin_> what is fiddle?
[09:31:24] <cjohnson> jsfiddle.net
[09:31:30] <cjohnson> reproduce the problem there
[09:31:38] <cjohnson> copy relevant code to do so
[09:37:23] <colin_> <cjohnson> :ok. i will post codes on codePen(fiddle load slowly),ok?
[09:37:58] <sl33k_> How do I iterate over each li elements image here? I would like to add src attribute dynamically? http://jsfiddle.net/er552d6c/
[09:38:43] <robertmaxrees> $('li').each(function() {});
[09:39:26] <colin_> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VYYvyz   <cjohnson>
[09:39:51] <sl33k_> I would want to use a class so it identifies correct li's
[09:39:51] <sl33k_>   				
[09:40:17] <sl33k_> $('.layout li').each(function(i, li) {// what could image go here}
[09:41:07] <robertmaxrees> sl33k_ you can do $(this).find('img') to get the image tag there.
[09:41:57] <sl33k_> good point. I am speculating you are making use of context here
[09:56:53] <mastahyeti> Hello JQuery
[09:57:03] <mastahyeti> who would I email about a potential security issue in JQuery?
[09:57:06] <Larado> hi, can someone tell me why the second form is not submitting anything http://jsfiddle.net/wf3e5kuj/
[09:58:06] <Jattenalle> mastahyeti, /join #jquery-dev
[09:58:27] <robertmaxrees> mastahyeti head to the jquery repo on git and submit a ticket.
[10:02:20] <Larado> ok nevermind i found out why
[10:11:15] <OnceMe> Hello, is there any map in JS or jQuery which I can update, like a map of world, and dots which updates those places?
[10:11:59] <OnceMe> like this one http://tweetping.net/
[10:12:10] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: Google Maps is the only one I have any experience with.
[10:12:56] <gremlyn> I have a form submit button that is hidden on page load (multi-step form wizard thing), and when the submit button appears and is clicked, jQuery isn't able to recognise that I am trying to catch the .submit() event
[10:13:15] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: This looks like a regular ol image and the goelocation on the tweets is set relative to that in some way.
[10:13:34] <BillCriswell> I want to tweet in Antartica.
[10:14:01] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:is there any example of that code?
[10:14:13] <OnceMe> and whats ol image?
[10:14:43] <gremlyn> ol I believe is an abbreviation for old
[10:14:48] <gremlyn> 'regular old image'
[10:15:06] <gremlyn> in this context, anyway :
[10:15:07] <gremlyn> :)
[10:15:20] <BillCriswell> ol' *
[10:18:52] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: I'd have to research a bit. Though, I dig the idea of letting google maps handle that shit for me.
[10:21:49] <OnceMe> or something like this BillCriswellhttp://onemilliontweetmap.com/
[10:21:51] <OnceMe> http://onemilliontweetmap.com/
[10:21:52] <OnceMe> :(
[10:23:11] <OnceMe> or how can I make ast least this : Tweets since page load
[10:23:14] <OnceMe> like on that page... ?
[10:28:31] <OnceMe> BillCriswell:
[10:28:40] <OnceMe> help me man you know what we have been through
[10:28:41] <OnceMe> WOO
[10:31:34] <BillCriswell> Haha I'm at work.
[10:39:15] <OnceMe> ok
[10:48:53] <Tomashe> hey guys
[10:49:13] <Tomashe> wondering something , i put on all my ajax request .always but its not always excuting. what could be the reason?
[10:55:16] <suppp> hey guys does the selector method always return an array even if I query for a id ? so $('#my_id') will always return an array ? Is there an alternate so that I can get an element instead of an array ?
[10:55:29] <barryhjames> I have to support IE8 in a current project, and I am having trouble with this bit of code. http://jsfiddle.net/11j781qe/ IE8 won’t work with getAttribute. Trying to find a replacement. Any advice? The code basically scrolls to a new section on the page when the input is clicked.
[10:55:33] <cjohnson> are you sure the request is completing Tomashe? could just be hanging at the server
[10:55:54] <cjohnson> suppp: it's always a collection, but many jquery methods can operate on a collection of one as if it were just one element
[10:56:13] <Jamesonwa> suppp you can always .push() the items to an object?
[10:56:35] <cjohnson> you can use $(selector).get(0) to get the node of the first (or only) element in the selector
[10:56:44] <cjohnson> it loses jquery methods in that case
[10:57:09] <cjohnson> suppp: or you could use :first or :last or whatever you're trying to restrict it to
[10:57:15] <suppp> cjohnson thanks ... specifically i want to call .play() on it because i'm querying for audio elements, but i guess i'll always have to have my code like this : $('#my_sound')[0].play()
[10:57:31] <cjohnson> $('#my_sound').play() should work fine
[10:57:37] <cjohnson> I believe
[10:57:44] <Jamesonwa> he probably has many audio files on one page
[10:57:48] <Jamesonwa> and its triggering them all
[10:57:53] <cjohnson> not if he's using an #id selector
[10:58:01] <Jamesonwa> ah. if you're using ID yes
[10:58:02] <suppp> ah cjohnson so $('#my_sound:first').play(). i'll give that a try $('#my_sound').play() does not work
[10:58:25] <cjohnson> oh, I see. I bet you're right, you want $('#my_sound').get(0).play()
[10:58:44] <cjohnson> since play isn't a jquery method. #id:first is pointless since there is only ever one item on a page that has a given ID
[10:59:30] <cjohnson> even if you violate that rule in your HTML markup #id selectors only ever return 1 element (in a jquery collection)
[10:59:34] <suppp> is there a benefit of using .get(0) over [0] ?
[10:59:56] <cjohnson> just consistent looking syntax...either or
[11:00:46] <suppp> ok gentelmen, thanks so much for the clarification. I have tested everything suggested, only .get(0) and [0] work to call .play() on
[11:00:52] <cjohnson> if you just want to get an element without jquery though... you can just use document.getElementById('#my_sound').play()
[11:01:02] <cjohnson> er, remove the #
[11:01:24] <suppp> cjohnson : true, in fact that's what i've had, but now changing to jquery because i'm not sure how cross browser document.getElementById is
[11:01:31] <cjohnson> quite
[11:01:44] <suppp> so you'd think it's safe ? even for mobile browsers ?

[11:02:15] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[11:02:49] <suppp> nice ... so that may be cleaner in the end
[11:12:07] <SillyTalker> what function am i looking for if i want to change properties of the parent element of something? (additionally, only if it has a certain class assigned)
[11:13:31] <shoky> .parent('.class')
[11:14:46] <SillyTalker> shoky, ty
[11:20:32] <gremlyn> can anyone help me get this .submit() to work? http://jsfiddle.net/TheGremlyn/brarhaj0/
[11:40:07] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: the issue seems to be input type='email'
[11:40:40] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: change that to 'input' and it works http://jsfiddle.net/brarhaj0/1/
[11:40:41] <gremlyn> noiseEee, the inputs types are irrelevant, I want to catch the html5 validation errors and work with them
[11:40:51] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: no, its not irrelevant
[11:41:17] <gremlyn> ok, well it needs to be irrelevant
[11:41:26] <NoiseEee> fair enough
[11:41:32] <gremlyn> those fields aren't the actual fields in my app, it's just a scaled down example of what is not working
[11:42:30] <NoiseEee> but that input type is what is making your particular fiddle 'not work'
[11:42:54] <ciqsteve> Q: does fadeOut block?
[11:44:47] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve block what?  execution?
[11:44:52] <robertmaxrees> because in that case, no.
[11:45:09] <gremlyn> NoiseEee, I think you're missing the point of what I am trying to do with that form
[11:45:09] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, yes.. ok
[11:45:19] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve that's why you have those callbacks.
[11:48:11] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: it works
[11:48:53] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: but if you've hidden the <div> where you have your 'required' input, its not going to be visible right? http://jsfiddle.net/brarhaj0/4/
[11:49:51] <ciqsteve> I'm doing something that's blocking the UI  not sure what..  hmmm
[11:50:24] <gremlyn> NoiseEee, the whole point is that when something that is not visible hasn't been filled out correctly, I want to catch that error and take them back to that step and focus on the expected input
[11:50:41] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: well you'll have to program for that yourself
[11:50:47] <gremlyn> that's the idea
[11:50:58] <gremlyn> but .submit() doesn't seem to catch those errors
[11:51:04] <gremlyn> hence it not working
[11:51:27] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: it captures the errors - it clearly identifies which fields don't have values and does not actually submit
[11:51:52] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: but you wanting to *show* those fields (because you've hidden them) is something else altogether
[11:51:59] <NoiseEee> it is not built-in
[11:52:12] <gremlyn> NoiseEee, on the one you linked if I don't fill in anything, my .submit event doesn't fire
[11:52:16] <gremlyn> so it doesn't work
[11:52:26] <NoiseEee> come on dude
[11:52:44] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, http://jsbin.com/liriqibaja/1/
[11:52:45] <NoiseEee> the last one i pasted - if you don't fill in the fields, the form is not submittable and does not fire any callback
[11:52:51] <ciqsteve> should that not block?
[11:53:26] <gremlyn> NoiseEee, that is correct, but the $(#'my-form').submit() have some stuff in there that was my attempt at taking the html5 validation errors and working with them, but that isn't working
[11:53:27] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: if you *do* provide values for all fields, indeed you see your alert()
[11:53:36] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: because it doesn't work that way.
[11:53:40] <gremlyn> NoiseEee, I want that alert if DON'T provide the values
[11:53:48] <gremlyn> it has to somehow
[11:53:51] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: well that's just not how it works
[11:54:03] <gremlyn> I refuse believe that I can't click that button and have access to the invalid event
[11:54:08] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: you can program your own stuff to do that, but it's not how the "required" attribute works with form elements.
[11:54:48] <NoiseEee> the "required" attribute of form elements blocks any 'submit' event if required form values aren't present
[11:54:57] <ciqsteve> http://jsbin.com/liriqibaja/1/
[11:55:02] <NoiseEee> as i understand it (and as it seems to show_
[11:55:02] <ciqsteve> sorry missed a piece
[11:55:18] <ciqsteve> Q: for the experts here.. .does that code block?
[11:56:11] <ciqsteve> is it because of the closure?
[11:56:22] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: perhaps you'd be more interested in a form validation library for jQuery instead of using the 'required' attribute of html5
[11:58:09] <gremlyn> NoiseEee, it looks like I can bind on invalid http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/GJeez/
[11:58:27] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: beauty
[11:58:39] <ciqsteve> what I'm trying to do there is run a fade in, followed by a fade out
[11:58:41] <ciqsteve> hence the closure
[11:58:44] <gremlyn> it's all about the order or operations...
[11:59:15] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve that's not how you do that.
[11:59:26] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, not surprised.. :)
[11:59:30] <robertmaxrees> also, your code has errors.
[11:59:36] <robertmaxrees> you need to put one in the done callback of the other.
[11:59:38] <ciqsteve> I don't think I copied it 100% correctly
[11:59:39] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: the downside with that 'bind' as far as i can see is that it requires focus of the input first
[11:59:41] <ciqsteve> it runs tho
[11:59:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:00:04] <gremlyn> NoiseEee, it does?
[12:00:11] <gremlyn> hrm, that could present a problem
[12:00:12] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve fix it up first ;)
[12:00:50] <ciqsteve> http://jsbin.com/liriqibaja/1/
[12:00:54] <ciqsteve> exact
[12:01:07] <robertmaxrees> that code is still invalid.
[12:01:26] <robertmaxrees> you're not mixing quotes correctly on that last line.
[12:01:55] <robertmaxrees> put the fadein code in the done callback of the fadeout call.
[12:01:57] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want to do.
[12:02:28] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve also, the IIFE isn't necessary in this cas.e
[12:03:00] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, put the fadein code in the done callback of the fadeout call.
[12:03:12] <ciqsteve> don't follow.. wouldnt that fadeout then fadein?
[12:03:18] <robertmaxrees> isn't that what you want?
[12:03:26] <robertmaxrees> you want it to do one thing, and then another?
[12:03:35] <ciqsteve> no.. this is a notification to a user.. pops up on bottom of the screen
[12:03:47] <robertmaxrees> then you want it to fade in then out?
[12:03:49] <robertmaxrees> flip the two.
[12:03:51] <ciqsteve> to make it look better I want it to fade in .. .stick for a few seconds, then fade out
[12:04:09] <robertmaxrees> then flip the two around.
[12:04:18] <robertmaxrees> do the fadein and put the code for the fadeout in the done callback.
[12:04:30] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/invalid @ gremlyn
[12:05:14] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: indeed that fiddle was checkign for the invalid event emitted by the input field;  as you can see from MDN, it doesn't bubble so you can't even  $(myForm).on('invalid',function(){});   :(
[12:05:35] <NoiseEee> gremlyn: so indeed you'll have to use an existing form validation library for what you want to achieve (or roll yr own)
[12:06:04] <gremlyn> maybe what I need to do is manually run checkValidity() before allowing the user to move on to the next step?
[12:06:19] <NoiseEee> sure
[12:06:20] <gremlyn> then the requisite fields would be focusable
[12:06:34] <gremlyn> I'll try it that way
[12:06:38] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, like so... ?
[12:06:39] <ciqsteve> http://jsbin.com/juticabupo/1/
[12:06:41] <NoiseEee> from a UI perspective as a user, i'd rather be warned/guided at the step i'm missing rather than go back there later
[12:06:51] <gremlyn> fair point
[12:07:58] <ciqsteve> fixed bracketing
[12:08:56] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve it'll look something like this, yeah: http://fixee.org/paste/sttulj1/
[12:09:23] <ciqsteve> y that looks the same.. nice thx
[12:17:02] <SillyTalker> i need to read a string and parse it to extract the data, whats the best way to do that?
[12:17:17] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you need to parse out.
[12:17:22] <SillyTalker> it's just a path to a file in this case
[12:17:50] <SillyTalker> let me try to explain
[12:17:56] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:18:08] <robertmaxrees> let's flip this on its head - setup a jsfiddle and explain what you want out of it :)
[12:18:27] <gremlyn> NoiseEee, this is working exactly as I need
[12:18:52] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, 2 days in a row.. thx again
[12:18:54] <gremlyn> grab the inputs on Next click, iterate over the returned array of input with .checkValidity()
[12:19:31] <NoiseEee> sweet gremlyn
[12:19:35] <SillyTalker> well i need to change a background image, if the "unique string" is present, something like [bg]some/file.jpg[/bg]
[12:19:45] <SillyTalker> i'm jsut wondering how this is usually done
[12:19:57] <SillyTalker> and i would do it otherwise but there is not much choice in my case
[12:20:06] <robertmaxrees> SillyTalker if you're just looking to see if one string contains another, indexOf() is usually what you want.
[12:20:55] <SillyTalker> robertmaxrees, so i basically search for [bg], then [/bg] and read everthing in between?
[12:21:13] <robertmaxrees> SillyTalker this is why an example would be nice. could you toss up an example?
[12:21:38] <SillyTalker> robertmaxrees, i cant even think of a way to explain it...
[12:22:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7ntu8qux/
[12:22:10] <robertmaxrees> is this what you need?
[12:22:59] <SillyTalker> robertmaxrees, well what im asking is, is that the best way to do it?
[12:23:04] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:23:08] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't even do anything.
[12:23:15] <robertmaxrees> you're
[12:23:21] <robertmaxrees> *you're missing a step in there.
[12:23:29] <robertmaxrees> i need to know what the data starts out as, and what you then need out of it.
[12:23:51] <SillyTalker> yeah i'mtrying to think of a good way for an example...
[12:24:02] <robertmaxrees> ... did you look at the fiddle?
[12:24:10] <slntw> Hi guys, is there any way I could get a notification (e-mail) when new releases of jquery and jquery-ui are released?
[12:24:46] <robertmaxrees> slntw you could watch the repos on github and do it that way.
[12:24:52] <SillyTalker> robertmaxrees, yes, a string... lol
[12:25:24] <robertmaxrees> SillyTalker so you have a string, and you want to get everything between [bg] and [/bg] out of it?
[12:25:44] <slntw> robertmaxrees but, it will notify me of every changeset right?
[12:26:07] <SillyTalker> robertmaxrees, lol i can probably manage that part if i look at the API :) but i'm still trying to think of a better way
[12:26:16] <robertmaxrees> SillyTalker i don't even know what you want to do.
[12:26:24] <robertmaxrees> you're not really giving me any information here.
[12:27:49] <_DB> hey guys I need possible ways of grabbing a data element from a form, I have a form with multiple checkboxes , the checkboxes have two id's the input id that im using to update , and I just added a data-order_id to keep trakc of the order in which theyre printed
[12:28:26] <SillyTalker> robertmaxrees, well i'm trying to think of a better way, i think i foudn a better way, let me mess with it for a while to see if i can get it to work, thanks for the help
[12:28:33] <_DB> when I check a box then press the edit button, I submit my checks form and update a div with images
[12:28:47] <_DB> prior to updating the div I need to grab the data-order_id
[12:29:15] <sweet2k4> im trying to change the innerHtml of of the second child of an element. but this doesnt seam to work.. $('.elementToChange:nth-child(2)').html('test');
[12:30:06] <slntw> _DB $('.yourselector').map(function(idx, chk) { return $(chk).data('order_id'); }).get();
[12:44:03] <_DB> anyone see something wrong with this line   id = $('[name="bchk[]"]').map(function(idx, chk) { return $(chk).data('order_id'); }).get();
[12:46:28] <robertmaxrees> $('[name="bchk[]"]') may not work the way you expect.
[12:46:44] <robertmaxrees> might need to escape those square brackets.
[12:47:30] <_DB> ok
[12:53:09] <_DB> slntw it didnt work for mem
[12:53:29] <_DB> I have this id = $('[name="bchk[]"]').map(function(idx, chk) { return $(chk).data('order_id'); }).get();
[12:53:50] <robertmaxrees> try console.log($('[name="bchk[]"]').length)
[12:53:52] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[12:54:58] <_DB> 8
[12:55:21] <robertmaxrees> okay, try  console.log($('[name="bchk[]"]').map(function(idx, chk) { return $(chk).data('order_id') }));
[12:55:25] <robertmaxrees> what do you get
[12:56:23] <_DB> an object
[12:56:41] <robertmaxrees> some context might be helpful here.
[12:56:47] <_DB> I need to get the value of a data-element
[12:56:53] <_DB> from my checkbox
[12:56:54] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle?
[12:57:11] <_DB> no
[12:57:17] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[12:57:17] <_DB> im using an MVC
[12:57:27] <_DB> so most of the data is made via a foreach
[12:57:49] <robertmaxrees> should be trivial to create a simplified example with basic markup
[13:02:14] <gremlyn> I'm getting the incredibly useful Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function with this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/TheGremlyn/90ddsyLs/
[13:02:42] <robertmaxrees> input.is()
[13:02:58] <robertmaxrees> input is going to be the underlying DOM node, not the jquery object.
[13:03:15] <gremlyn> ah, ok
[13:03:31] <robertmaxrees> if you want to iterate through a jquery object, check out .each()
[13:03:35] <robertmaxrees> instead of what you're doing there.
[13:03:56] <gremlyn> use .each instead of the for loop you mean?
[13:04:01] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:04:18] <robertmaxrees> that'll also reduce potential issues with variables you might get with what you have there.
[13:04:26] <gremlyn> ok, I'll give it a try, thanks
[13:06:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/90ddsyLs/3/
[13:06:20] <robertmaxrees> this is closer to what you want.
[13:06:51] <gremlyn> so checkValidity() won't car if it is a jquery object or a dom node?
[13:06:54] <gremlyn> care*
[13:06:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/90ddsyLs/4/ with the preventDefault you want.
[13:07:11] <robertmaxrees> i have no clue - I don't know what checkvalidity is.
[13:07:35] <gremlyn> html5 validation check
[13:07:44] <gremlyn> that works on the dom node in my current form
[13:08:13] <robertmaxrees> ah, that needs the underlying dom node.
[13:08:31] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/90ddsyLs/5/ something like this
[13:09:08] <gremlyn> got it, thanks
[13:10:59] <sweet2k4> how do i selelc a specifc child in in an element. element:nth-child(2) ?
[13:11:06] <grabbby> Anyone care to help me with a Google Charts issue? Prety straightforward I think and I'll offer reddit gold or something through PP

[13:11:41] <grabbby> I'm using a jquery script to prepare a CSV for Google charts and can't manage to have it draw correctly
[13:12:01] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ grabbby
[13:12:01] <b-ot> grabbby: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:12:13] <robertmaxrees> we're here to help.  for free even!
[13:12:31] <grabbby> thanks robertmaxrees! just I'm so exasperated I thought I'd put up a little somethin
[13:12:33] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 basically.
[13:12:56] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: doesnt seam to work...
[13:12:56] <grabbby> Can anyone familiar with Google Charts tell me where this is broken? http://jsfiddle.net/6cuhtqfk/5/
[13:13:29] <robertmaxrees> element :nth-child(2)
[13:13:30] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4
[13:13:45] <grabbby> I'm using jquery.csv-0.71 to parse my CSV into a readable array
[13:14:08] <sweet2k4> $('element:nth-child(2)').html('test');
[13:14:20] <robertmaxrees> $('element :nth-child(2)').html('test'); sweet2k4
[13:14:23] <robertmaxrees> add a space in there.
[13:14:28] <sweet2k4> oh
[13:14:43] <sweet2k4> didnt know it matterd, il try, thanls
[13:14:47] <sweet2k4> thanks*
[13:14:51] <robertmaxrees> space means "children of"
[13:16:55] <robertmaxrees> grabbby sharing the raw data format and adding in your special csv lib will help folks troubleshoot.
[13:17:16] <robertmaxrees> the none formatted version of the data, i mean.
[13:17:18] <robertmaxrees> *non
[13:17:22] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: ahh now it worked! it makes sens too
[13:17:24] <grabbby> I can't quite do this with jsfiddle though?
[13:17:35] <robertmaxrees> grabbby you can share the contents of that csv file...
[13:18:02] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: its the same thing as $('element #idOfTheChild').html('test');
[13:18:19] <sweet2k4> first selecting element and then the child
[13:18:22] <robertmaxrees> sure, but you'd never actually do that with IDs ;)
[13:18:30] <sweet2k4> yeah but the concept
[13:18:47] <sweet2k4> well thanls for helping me out
[13:18:47] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[13:18:52] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[13:19:52] <grabbby> bon appetit, robertmaxrees!
[13:21:55] <iTrace> I have a question about writing plugins: In this example plugin: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PwwZXw an alert is fired from a script at the top of my plugin. But, why would the plugin fire at all if there are no DOM elements that I'm attatching the plugin to like this: $("input:button").scared();
[13:23:08] <iTrace> Is that normal behavior for a plugin? I would have thought that the plugin would do nothing if the DOM element I'm attaching it to doesn't exist.
[13:25:55] <sl33k_> I get this error while iterating over array of object. http://paste.ubuntu.com/9078851/ What gives?
[13:26:09] <iTrace> I didn't write the example plugin by the way. I'm using it as an example.
[13:26:20] <sl33k_> ex $('.layout li').each(function(idx) {
[13:26:21] <sl33k_> 			//console.log(idx);
[13:26:21] <sl33k_>   			$(this).find('img').attr("src", items[idx].imageUrl);
[13:26:30] <sl33k_> ... other code
[13:38:15] <SillyTalker> robertmaxrees, since the file was an image anyway, i added a button to the html editor from the cms i use, to add an image from a class, this makes it easier for them, i will try to remove the <img>, and use its src parameter as the data

[14:42:25] <grabbby> Anyone want to make a quick $10? Help me sort this out it's driving me crazy: http://jsfiddle.net/6cuhtqfk/6/
[14:42:40] <grabbby> Having trouble using Google Charts/Dashboard with a CSV
[14:50:23] <d0de> grabby, is jsfiddle down or something? it's not loading for me
[14:53:10] <acidjazz> grabby runs jsfiddle?
[14:53:21] <grabbby> d0de: It's getting the data from a CSV
[14:53:34] <grabbby> Naw, I posted a fiddle asking for help
[14:54:40] <d0de> grabby, for me the fiddle never loads, it hangs after 980kB in network transfer
[14:55:05] <grabbby> weird
[14:56:19] <d0de> it is weird. The code never shows, just the jsfiddle loading screen
[14:56:38] <SillyTalker> how do i use .css() on .wrap() ?
[15:01:09] <grabbby> d0de: http://jsfiddle.net/6cuhtqfk/7/ how's this come up?
[15:05:20] <d0de> grabby, my bad, the google api stuff were being blocked by a chrome privacy extension
[15:10:11] <SillyTalker> when i used .wrap(), can i somehow store the element it created in case i want to do other stuff with it later?
[15:19:48] <grabbby> d0de: oh, makes sense I suppose
[15:36:37] <toothe> hm... I noticed my onclick isn't running anymore...
[15:37:00] <toothe> i mean, ready(function() ...) is not working.
[15:37:23] <david89> Hello. In my application I have a view that redirects after receiving a POSTed form. How could I POST a form as if there was a submit() of a form, without having an actual form? my problem witgh $.post is that is asincronous
[15:37:28] <robertmaxrees> put a console log in there and make sure, toothe
[15:37:41] <robertmaxrees> david89 async shouldn't be an issue.
[15:38:05] <robertmaxrees> david89 you can't post without a form or ajax.
[15:38:10] <david89> robertmaxrees: my view returns a 302 redirect
[15:38:18] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't matter
[15:38:32] <toothe> weird,...
[15:38:32] <david89> robertmaxrees: basically I would like a .post() that handles that redirect
[15:38:41] <robertmaxrees> david89 $.post() should do that for you.
[15:39:03] <david89> robertmaxrees: the value that the success callback receives is the html of the page redirected to
[15:39:21] <robertmaxrees> right... because that's the data you're returning.
[15:40:04] <toothe> does a $(document).ready() need to be in the <head> or <body>? or does it not mater?
[15:40:12] <toothe> mine doesn't seem to be firing off....
[15:40:13] <robertmaxrees> toothe it doesn't really matter
[15:40:24] <robertmaxrees> toothe did you try putting a console log in there?
[15:40:28] <robertmaxrees> are there any console errors?
[15:40:28] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[15:40:28] <toothe> yes...
[15:40:32] <toothe> no console errors...
[15:40:44] <robertmaxrees> then you likely have a bug.
[15:40:56] <robertmaxrees> try a $(window).load() instead and see if that works.
[15:41:01] <robertmaxrees> if it does, your HTML is invalid.
[15:41:18] <david89> robertmaxrees: but my view is returning a 302 header, not the data. I believe jquery is fetching that
[15:41:36] <robertmaxrees> david89 err I think you're confused about how this all works together.
[15:41:47] <toothe> hm..just did a simple $(document).ready(function() { alert('testing'); }); ad no dice.
[15:41:52] <toothe> i'l try the window load, as you said.
[15:42:05] <robertmaxrees> toothe if the window load works, your html is way broken.
[15:42:36] <toothe> no dice...
[15:42:43] <toothe> neither works...not sure why not.
[15:42:47] <robertmaxrees> toothe then something is broken.
[15:42:54] <toothe> how would I Even track that down?
[15:42:57] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not filtering errors out in your dev tools.
[15:43:23] <toothe> yeah, might be...using chrome.
[15:43:39] <toothe> im prety new to this...
[15:44:47] <robertmaxrees> toothe http://i.imgur.com/93Rsemt.png
[15:44:54] <robertmaxrees> see that icon in your dev tools?
[15:44:54] <david89> robertmaxrees: if i understand correctly, when a browser submits a form it sends a POST and then it receives a 302, then it does the get on the url received with the 302. $.post() is doing the same and passing the data to my success calback
[15:45:07] <toothe> yes...
[15:45:16] <robertmaxrees> toothe open that and make sure you have "all" selected.
[15:45:24] <toothe> yes, its on all...
[15:45:35] <robertmaxrees> toothe then you have something else broken.  link to the page?
[15:45:50] <toothe> its on my laptop...
[15:45:54] <toothe> how would I give you access? best way?
[15:46:09] <robertmaxrees> toothe are you just opening a file on your hard drive?
[15:46:12] <toothe> i could probably engineer a solution
[15:46:17] <toothe> robertmaxrees: yes, but hosted on a django server.
[15:46:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:46:29] <robertmaxrees> are you opening it via django?
[15:46:31] <toothe> im writing this program in Django
[15:46:39] <toothe> running it on a Django development server
[15:46:41] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab and make sure that you're not getting a 404s on your scripts.
[15:46:53] <robertmaxrees> david89 right... what are you expecting otherwise?
[15:46:54] <toothe> oh wait...304?
[15:47:03] <toothe> no, that's not modified.
[15:47:11] <toothe> let me setup visibily for you...
[15:47:13] <robertmaxrees> 404
[15:47:22] <toothe> no, 304 , not modified.
[15:47:42] <robertmaxrees> right - you care if any are 404s.
[15:47:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:48:13] <david89> robertmaxrees: no nothing. I would like to emulate that without having an actual form.
[15:48:18] <toothe> let me setup access for you, give me a moment while I work my port forwarding magic.
[15:48:27] <robertmaxrees> toothe no logins or anything please >.>
[15:48:36] <toothe> oh? i just created you an account :-(
[15:48:39] <robertmaxrees> david89 i'd have to see the setup then because I'm not grokking based on your example.
[15:48:53] <toothe> maybe I can just paste the rendered code on dpaste.
[15:48:54] <robertmaxrees> toothe i'm always a little wary of stuff like that =/
[15:48:57] <robertmaxrees> that'd be nice.
[15:49:08] <toothe> i can respect that...after all, you're helping me!
[15:49:59] <toothe> Here you go: http://dpaste.com/25WJRZH
[15:50:05] <toothe> you know what...let me run this through an HTML validator tol.
[15:50:11] <toothe> tool* (sorry, still not used to this new keyboard)
[15:50:49] <robertmaxrees> <body onmousemove = "reload()"; onclick = "reload()"> worries me.
[15:50:55] <robertmaxrees> also, is your code in base.js?
[15:51:27] <toothe> wow, quite a few errors.
[15:51:34] <toothe> oh pardon, let me send that too.
[15:51:38] <robertmaxrees> nonono.
[15:51:45] <robertmaxrees> i'm just asking if that's where your code is.
[15:51:57] <robertmaxrees> because if so, move that include after your jquery and jquery cookie includes.
[15:52:14] <toothe> here is base.js: http://dpaste.com/110V264
[15:52:36] <robertmaxrees> where's the document ready?
[15:53:28] <toothe> just a moment...
[15:54:11] <toothe> hm...
[15:54:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing any reference to the broken code.
[15:54:47] <toothe> yeah...what the...
[15:56:50] <toothe> ohhh
[15:56:53] <toothe> i think i see the issue
[15:57:04] <toothe> I changed my template's variable name around and I think it wasn't renderig at all
[15:57:11] <robertmaxrees> that'll do it.
[15:57:17] <toothe> im embarassed.
[15:57:21] <robertmaxrees> nah, don't be.
[15:57:39] <robertmaxrees> when it's something major like that, it usually means it's something simple.
[15:58:20] <toothe> fixed it...
[15:58:27] <toothe> i needed a second set of eyes to realize that.
[15:58:31] <toothe> something right in front of me.
[15:58:43] <robertmaxrees> it's called "rubber duck problem solving"
[15:59:10] <toothe> ha!
[15:59:14] <toothe> i should get a rubber duck just for hat.
[15:59:15] <toothe> that*
[15:59:34] <tw2113> rubber duck debugging has a better ring to it
[15:59:40] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[15:59:58] <tw2113> i prefer lego guy debugging though
[16:00:03] <toothe> now to save this using git (first time using it)
[16:00:22] <robertmaxrees> git's easy
[16:19:39] <wa5ted> toothe: git is fun times
[16:51:02] <x00x90> Whats the best way of selecting a submit button that has only classname set ?
[16:51:19] <robertmaxrees> $('.className') ?
[16:52:41] <x00x90> robertmaxrees: but if other html objects with the same class name got included on the dom ?
[16:52:57] <robertmaxrees> $('input.classname')
[16:53:10] <x00x90> robertmaxrees:thanks
[16:53:33] <robertmaxrees> or $('input[type="button"].classname')
[17:06:20] <superspring_> hey guys, is anyone aware of a jquery addon which lets you visualise a coding class structure?
[17:07:25] <robertmaxrees> a what now?
[17:12:29] <greengriminal> Whose awakwe
[17:12:40] <greengriminal> *awake. lol clearly not me since i cannot spell :P
[17:12:50] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ greengriminal
[17:12:51] <b-ot> greengriminal: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:12:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:13:05] <robertmaxrees> superspring_ could you clarify your question?
[17:14:04] <superspring_> robertmaxrees: this is some-what an open ended question, but i am looking for a way of creating and editing a diagram of a class structure inside browser
[17:14:13] <greengriminal> Okay so given the following: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ade720012e59e275bccf I am trying to set an label class to active it meets a condition
[17:14:28] <greengriminal> here's the screenshot to demonstrate what I've tried in the console: http://i.imgur.com/5jftRQA.png
[17:15:50] <robertmaxrees> Greener "a class structure" meaning....?
[17:15:52] <greengriminal> What should happen is when the page is finished loading it should see which input fields have the prop checked and if it returns true set the active class. But this doesn't work.
[17:15:55] <robertmaxrees> err, superspring_
[17:16:19] <robertmaxrees> superspring do you mean a class in your JS code?
[17:16:47] <robertmaxrees> greengriminal can you setup a fidduel of what you're trying to do?
[17:16:50] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle
[17:16:57] <superspring> robertmaxrees: more of a picture, a diagram, which can be used to visualise the class structure...
[17:17:41] <robertmaxrees> superspring that'
[17:17:55] <robertmaxrees> *that's not really going to work in JS since JS doesn't really have "classes" in the traditional sense.
[17:18:17] <robertmaxrees> you can enumerate over properties and write stuff out to the page and show what the object/s look like.
[17:18:58] <superspring> robertmaxrees: right, i'm not talking about Javascript classes... i'm talking about a visual display of classes in any language...
[17:19:44] <robertmaxrees> superspring i don't know of any plugin to do that.
[17:20:10] <superspring> is there a better channel to ask in?
[17:20:22] <robertmaxrees> for jquery plugins?  not really.
[17:20:43] <robertmaxrees> that i know of, at least.
[17:20:56] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty trivial to build something out yourself though.
[17:21:25] <greengriminal> robertmaxrees: So quick example here: http://jsfiddle.net/h4sx4c0a/
[17:22:28] <greengriminal> you'll see that there is 4 input fields with the checked property. Now what i am trying to do is set the 'active' class on this when the input field has the property 'checked'
[17:22:28] <abailarri> Hello. I have a problem. I use socket.io for print some html in the page in ral time. The problem s that I want to use some of this new printed html for a selector, I can't. Any suggestion please?

[18:47:25] <chrismatic> Hi
[18:48:11] <chrismatic> I'm curious: as far as contributing PRs/patches to jQuery goes, is there any standard method used to benchmark speeds? I know about jsPerf, but I'm wondering whether there's a suite that's standard for jQuery performance
[18:48:33] <shoky> Besan: this is better http://jsbin.com/babusadome/2/edit
[18:48:43] <shoky> o he's gone
[18:51:48] <BillCriswell> Whoa, console.log('new: %s, old: %s', val, oldVal)
[18:54:26] <Robdgreat> TIL
[19:05:58] <BillCriswell> Robdgreat: Same.
[19:06:34] <BillCriswell> Robdgreat: Another great one is console.table(someArray[, 'columns,you,want']);
[19:06:53] <Robdgreat> !
[19:08:10] <BillCriswell> Robdgreat: Really awesome for arrays of objects, but sweet for multi dimensional arrays as well.
[19:08:49] <BillCriswell> Well... one nest level.
[19:10:01] <Robdgreat> I just swapped the badly worn and cracked and basically wrecked chair mat that's been vexing me for 3 months with the much better condition one at the desk opposite mine
[19:10:04] <Robdgreat> \o/
[19:17:36] <TheHackOps> Sup guys, So I have this script that when you click an image it appends it to a lightbox, when you click the image in the light box it closes the light box and puts the image back in the gallery, the problem is when i reset the width and height of the image using the methods width() and height() it adds a style property to the element which then breaks the event handler
[19:17:53] <TheHackOps> I was wondering what the correct method is for changing the HTML property of width and height
[19:20:26] <BillCriswell> Robdgreat: Weeeee
[19:35:23] <colin_> anyone here?
[19:39:23] <Oka> Yo.
[19:45:43] <colin_> Oka. do you familiar with jquery validate?
[19:48:29] <Oka> colin_: Sadly, not really.
[19:49:55] <colin_> o, i just write a customer validation method...but not works..
[20:07:18] <Oka> Make a test case
[20:52:48] <toothe> I want to add a "ad more" button that when users click on it, a new form appears for user sto enter data into
[20:52:57] <toothe> its not merely 1 form, its several (usrname, password, real name, etc)
[20:53:09] <toothe> so, 1 page will have an arbitrary number of forms
[20:53:24] <BillCriswell> I think you mean fields in a form and not a form?
[20:53:30] <toothe> is the best way to do this to hard-code a form template and add it dynamically, or to have jquery copy an existing form?
[20:53:42] <toothe> wow sorry, wrong terminology -let me be more clear.
[20:54:26] <toothe> a set of input fields (primarily text) -lets call it a user formset.
[20:55:12] <toothe> when the user of the system clicks "add another user", jquery should render several new input fields along a pattern
[20:55:39] <toothe> i hope that made sense, im having trouble finding the right words.
[20:57:00] <toothe> let me create an example...please give me a moment.
[20:57:30] <BillCriswell> toothe: Ok sounds good... I mean either way should work. Guess it depends on some more details.
[20:58:15] <toothe> i plan to have similar functionality in more than 1 place in the application, so I"m thinking it might not be a bad idea to mirror an existing template with jquery and just increment a number?
[20:58:47] <toothe> so like <input type=text name=user1> becomes name=user2
[20:59:53] <toothe> which method is the best/better?
[20:59:59] <toothe> and, do existing working ersions of this exist?
[21:00:01] <BillCriswell> toothe: You probably want multiple forms.
[21:00:54] <toothe> Yes, I do want multiple forms.
[21:04:33] <AcidRain2012> hello. when i do a .load(file) how can i make the css apply to the divs that were loadewd
[21:04:58] <toothe> BillCriswell: Is what I'm requesting a common task?
[21:05:03] <toothe> and a recommended way to do things?
[21:05:10] <toothe> i guess that's part of my generla question.
[21:06:19] <AcidRain2012> toothe, u could just get the name of the element and append a value to it
[21:06:40] <AcidRain2012> i would do like user_1, so u have a delimiter to get the # by
[21:06:44] <BillCriswell> toothe: I'm not sure what the recommended way would be. I just hacked this up real quick: http://jsbin.com/yudogevimi/1/edit?html,js,output
[21:06:57] * toothe reads
[21:06:59] <toothe> wow, for me...?
[21:07:21] <toothe> I"m legitimately humbled....
[21:07:39] <BillCriswell> toothe: No sweat!
[21:08:34] <AcidRain2012> any ideas on my issue? :D
[21:08:36] <BillCriswell> AcidRain2012: You can do like... $('.foo').load('whatever.html'); then just use .foo .selector-from-whatever { }.
[21:09:16] <AcidRain2012> uhmmmm what u mean use .foo .selector-from-whatever? i think thats the part im missing
[21:09:28] <toothe> so, how exactly does this work? It changes on onclick of add another to append to it...I need to figure out what form:last does.
[21:09:47] <BillCriswell> toothe: Just grabs the last form from the .forms div and clones it.
[21:09:58] <BillCriswell> AcidRain2012: You would put that in a style sheet.
[21:10:15] <AcidRain2012> hmmmm
[21:10:18] <AcidRain2012> let me check this out
[21:11:36] <AcidRain2012> BillCriswell, sry, still doesnt work. ive made the selectors children of each other as suggested
[21:14:06] <AcidRain2012> i have to refresh the page for it to work :(
[21:14:14] <BillCriswell> That doesn't make sense.
[21:15:32] <AcidRain2012> well its only accessible through a session. but heres the deal. the links in a footer work and load fine. the divs in a left menu however, do not
[21:17:25] <AcidRain2012> hmmm
[21:17:29] <AcidRain2012> appears ive asked the wrong question
[21:17:36] <AcidRain2012> my jquery is not having effect on the loaded divs
[21:17:46] <BillCriswell> AcidRain2012: There you go.
[21:18:22] <BillCriswell> Ok, you can do like.. $('.foo').load('whatever.html', function () { $('.foo').find('.something-from-whatever').css('color', 'hotpink'); });
[21:18:57] <AcidRain2012> my function is delegated. but still no response
[21:20:14] <BillCriswell> AcidRain2012: Would need to see a demo.
[21:20:29] <AcidRain2012> i have absolute fear of marking this up as a demo. lol
[21:20:47] <BillCriswell> AcidRain2012: Break it down to the minimal thing.
[21:20:58] <AcidRain2012> link me to a demo site plz?
[21:21:15] <BillCriswell> jsfiddle.net
[21:22:35] <AcidRain2012> huh... i dont see how i can do this since files are included using php. the left menu is only loaded once a user is actually logged in
[21:22:58] <AcidRain2012> i could just include the included file in the main html. but that would cause it to work
[21:25:39] <BillCriswell> Shit I have to run.
[21:25:43] <BillCriswell> Good luck.
[21:25:54] <AcidRain2012> http://jsfiddle.net/r1r6fps9/1/
[21:25:58] <AcidRain2012> best i can do
[21:26:08] <AcidRain2012> and thats not even a working version.
[21:26:48] <AcidRain2012> actually if anyone can help. plz read this one: http://jsfiddle.net/r1r6fps9/2/    i have comments that tell the issue
[21:37:43] <Uhkis> AcidRain2012: your width() is never 20

[22:09:08] <toothe> is there a way to modify a cloned object prior to rendering it?
[22:09:17] <toothe> specifically, changing form name.
[22:29:31] <AcidRain2012> Uhkis, sry, i didnt include the css.
[22:29:58] <AcidRain2012> though, that is not the issue
[23:06:21] <jorvis> Terminology question - what is it called when you want a box of sorts to appear with a paragraph of information when you hover over an item, then disappear when you hover off?  It's not a dialog ...
[23:07:23] <P1RATEZ> mega/large/jumbo/freaking huge tooltip
[23:12:00] <kinesis> i want to change an element's ID and have it's respective css rules reloaded.. how?
[23:12:09] <kinesis> I tried .prop but I don't think it is working?
[23:12:41] <sacho> what do you mean "have its respective css rules reloaded"?
[23:13:56] <kinesis> im trying to make a responsive layout for mobile and I need to change a div's CSS in the stylesheet by changing it's id
[23:16:51] <kinesis> the UL id changes from triple to double but it is still triple inherited css
[23:17:56] <krz> when a user types in an input box, id like to trigger the console.log 'z' ONLY after 3 seconds. however, when the interval starts. the timer needs to reset. i have this so far https://gist.github.com/ba91783325f499f54fbc
[23:18:13] <krz> doesnt seem to work. it keeps outputing the console.log 'z'
[23:18:19] <krz> any help?
[23:19:18] <arunbabu> I have an image on my HTML page. I change the image file on the file system, but the HTML page still shows the old image, even after refresh.
[23:19:21] <P1RATEZ> kinesis: $('ul#tripple').attr('id','double'), like this?
[23:19:34] <kinesis> Yeah I used .prop though
[23:21:53] <Cork> arunbabu: load the image in it's own tab and hit ctrl+f5
[23:22:16] <Cork> arunbabu: the browser caches resources and refresh on the webpage doesn't affect that
[23:22:20] <kinesis> Should I try .attr? $("#triple").prop("id", "double");
[23:22:41] <Cork> (that is why many cms systems add ?_=<timestamp> after there css and images
[23:22:43] <Cork> )
[23:22:49] <arunbabu> Cork: I'm working on a hybrid mobile app. This is page on my mobile app. I can only refresh fragments on that page. I've done that
[23:23:26] <krz> or should i be using timeout instead?
[23:23:29] <sammych> this webiew is some kind of quirky: I have AC that builds <li>s. If you type, results are in the DOM but the view doesn't repaint. You have to physically tap out of the input to get it to repaint (and .blur() won't do it either). So, if you do that and do more typing...it's updating the results like it should.
[23:23:59] <arunbabu> Cork: I can't add ?_<timestamp> since the image is on device file system and not a remote server
[23:24:04] <Cork> krz: you should avoid ever using setInterval
[23:24:06] <sammych> but once you remove all the letters from the input and type again, it stops repainting again
[23:24:09] <Cork> and yes setTimeout is what you want
[23:24:49] <Cork> arunbabu: i didn't say you should, i explained why you need to refresh the image individually
[23:25:09] <Cork> arunbabu: alternatively blow away the cache
[23:26:05] <sammych> hmm. It seems like it's not repainting if the UL is empty. Maybe if I always keep a hidden element in the UL, it might trick it
[23:26:06] <Cork> sammych: ya, mobiles have a lot of rendering bugs
[23:26:30] <arunbabu> Cork: Is there a way to force image to render without looking in browser cache in hybrid mobile apps?
[23:26:51] <Cork> arunbabu: the only way to get around the cache is to make a new unique url
[23:27:01] <Cork> (from js that is)
[23:27:05] <sammych> I spent about 12 hours just figuring out Cordova's FileEntry API
[23:27:08] <Cork> a server can set http headers
[23:27:35] <Cork> arunbabu: and the unique url is by appending the ?_=<timestamp>
[23:27:48] <Cork> arunbabu: note the server end doesn't have to parse it
[23:27:56] <Cork> so it works with local files too
[23:30:31] <arunbabu> Cork: My filename is of the form "..../index.png" . If I append "?_=<timestamp>" to it, won't it look for the file ".../index.png?_=<timestamp>" in the file system?
[23:30:46] <Cork> no
[23:30:56] <arunbabu> Cork: the file is on the mobile device's file system
[23:31:02] <Cork> ...?<anything> is stipped before it looks
[23:31:38] <kinesis> $("ul#footer-1").css("width", "500"); doesnt seem to work am i doing it incorrectly?
[23:32:09] <arunbabu> Cork: Thanks cork I'll try it out
[23:32:32] <Cork> kinesis: you for got type
[23:32:41] <kinesis> Type?
[23:32:44] <Cork> kinesis: and you most likely want to use .width() instead .of .css
[23:32:50] <Cork> px em rem %
[23:32:55] <Cork> pt
[23:32:56] <Cork> cm
[23:32:57] <Cork> mm
[23:32:58] <Cork> :)
[23:33:00] <kinesis> Type?oh yeah
[23:33:13] <Cork> .width() doesn't need it, but .css does
[23:34:09] <kinesis> $("ul#footer-1").width(500);
[23:34:20] <kinesis> I tried that but the guy still comes in at 750px as defined in the css
[23:34:22] <sammych> unit* and you'd only need it if you're passing in the string
[23:34:35] <sammych> if you give it a number, it'll be pixels
[23:34:44] <Cork> kinesis: look in the dom inspector and see if you have style="width:500px"
[23:34:49] <kinesis> Yeah that's intended.. I'm just making it work on smartphone
[23:35:06] <Cork> kinesis: also don't prefix ids with element tags
[23:35:14] <Cork> your slowing down the selector for no good reason
[23:35:26] <Cork> id's are unique, no need to add the extra lookup
[23:35:36] <kinesis> I need the ul within #footer-id though
[23:35:47] <Cork> that isn't what you're selecting
[23:35:58] <Cork> your selecting all ul elements with the id #footer-1
[23:36:17] <Cork> $("#footer-1 ul") selects the ul inside #footer-1
[23:37:43] <kinesis> Ok. so the recentis most efficient
[23:38:42] <Cork> kinesis: the speed relation is id > class >>>> element >>>>>> attribute >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> :contains
[23:39:11] <Cork> and ul#id first selects all ul then filter out the one that matches the unique id
[23:39:23] <Cork> something that makes my head spin why ppl do this
[23:39:45] <Cork> they are literally asking for a slower selector
[23:40:19] <Cork> yes, it often doesn't matter, cause you aren't in a code path that is that speed sensitive
[23:40:31] <kinesis> that is slow!
[23:40:42] <Cork> but it still brows my mind, as you actually type more to make it slower
[23:44:00] <kinesis> when i use .attr() to change the id from triple to double it isn't loading the css for #double
[23:45:04] <Cork> kinesis: as long as the attribute is actually changing it should
[23:45:09] <kinesis> hmm ok.
[23:45:32] <Cork> kinesis: though you might have multiple elements with the same id
[23:45:39] <Cork> so you only change the id of one of them
[23:46:18] <Cork> (that is invalid html, as ids must be uniquely identifying one element)
[23:47:48] <Besan> Need help http://jsbin.com/wicaba/5/edit
[23:47:51] <Besan> please
[23:48:10] <Cork> ?ask
[23:48:11] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:49:16] <Besan> In the JSBIN provided i'm trying to populate data from JSON and update with new data only
[23:49:16] <sammych> OOOH YEAH. display:none LI in the UL fixes it :D
[23:50:10] <Besan> sammych, whom you're addressing to ??
[23:50:19] <sammych> just me
[23:50:24] <kinesis> Im trying to do this http://csswizardry.com/2010/02/mutiple-column-lists-using-one-ul/ but make it responsive
