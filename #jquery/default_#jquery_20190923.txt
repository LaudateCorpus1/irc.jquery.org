[05:15:03] <Paradisee> hello
[05:15:12] <Paradisee> could anybody explain me: https://developer.mozilla.org/it/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[05:19:27] <AdamPDotty> tutto bene
[05:38:00] <Cork> Paradisee: explain what?
[05:40:41] <Paradisee> what it does
[05:40:45] <Paradisee> .applu
[05:40:48] <Paradisee> aplly*
[05:40:50] <Paradisee> fuck
[05:40:57] <Paradisee> apply *
[05:41:19] <Cork> it does the same as .call, except it expands an array as arguments instead of expecting them as separate arguments
[05:41:52] <Cork> .apply("me", [1, 2, 3, 4]) => .call("me", 1, 2, 3, 4)
[05:44:17] <Paradisee> why don't just use foo()
[05:44:25] <Paradisee> what is it used for
[05:51:52] <pavonia> It's usually used to call a function with a new "this"
[05:52:29] <pavonia> (Though ##javascript is better suited for this kind of questions)
[05:55:01] <Cork> Paradisee: foo() can't set the instance varaible
[05:55:12] <Cork> that is the difference to .call
[05:55:28] <Cork> and for .apply is to expand if you have a list of arguments
[05:56:10] <Cork> ex. obj.foo.apply(obj, arguments.splice(1)) to forward the current functions arguments
[05:56:51] <Cork> opps  obj.foo.apply(obj, Array.property.slice.call(arguments, 1))
[05:56:58] <Cork> (forgot arguments isn't an array instance)
[06:02:28] <crs> Cork: Hi. :)
[09:03:37] <Stoot> If jQuery onces dies I jump from a bridge
[09:32:53] <thykka> be careful what you promise :D
[09:33:04] <thykka> kinda seems like the odds are against you on this one..
[12:22:26] <Stoot> thykka NO!
[12:23:46] <robertmaxrees> they're not necessarily wrong though.  it's a great library, sure, but it's also not the only solution.
[12:24:12] * taplar missed something
[12:24:23] <robertmaxrees> check the logs :)
[12:24:57] <taplar> :/
[12:30:15] <Stoot> it's in my opinion the most easy one
[12:30:31] <robertmaxrees> compared to what?
[12:30:43] <Stoot> vue, angular, react, etc
[12:31:02] <robertmaxrees> ah - those aren't the same thing as jquery.
[12:31:06] <robertmaxrees> they solve a different problem.
[12:31:18] <Stoot> nah trhey created many as well :D
[12:31:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:31:33] <Stoot> brb, gotta run
[12:31:36] <Uhkis> is it just me or is it funny when people make promises in js channels
[12:31:37] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, those all solve different problems than jquery.
[12:31:46] <taplar> new Promise()
[12:32:03] <taplar> just you
[12:32:08] <Stoot> Uhkis whent here is water under the bridhe and it's not high, I still met my promise :D
[12:32:18] <Uhkis> oh :(
[12:32:48] <Stoot> sorry for typo's, anyways, query helpt me wrap fast decent things, I like
[12:32:53] <Stoot> cu!
[13:17:16] <Stoot> back. This guy is pretty right https://arp242.net/jquery.html
[13:17:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:17:50] <Stoot> I like all the people waving jQuery goodbye in their blogs which sounds most of the time; I hope you support me all!
[13:17:51] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't change the point that Vue, React, Angular, etc solve a different problem than jQuery.
[13:18:13] <Stoot> they don't solve problem, they bring something extra
[13:18:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:18:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:18:33] <robertmaxrees> you're conflacting concepts.
[13:18:36] <Stoot> robertmaxrees you didn't read that blog that good/fast
[13:18:50] <robertmaxrees> i've read it before.
[13:18:55] <Stoot> robertmaxrees you talk about problems, they aren't
[13:19:00] <Stoot> *there
[13:19:29] <Stoot> robertmaxrees so you are googeling the jQuery future on a daily base as well ?
[13:20:27] <robertmaxrees> 3 things: 1. i never said jQuery isn't useful.  2. you're still confused about what jQuery does vs react, vue, and angular.  3. you're putting words in my mouth ;)
[13:21:23] <robertmaxrees> react et al. are frameworks that try to bring structure to more complex applications.  jquery is an incredibly poor fit for that job.
[13:22:42] <Stoot> robertmaxrees 1. I didn't put that in your mouth, don;t know where you get that feeling from, 2. I'm not confused, everything else thinks it's no use where it makes things easier that the other (frameworks) don't, following Github, etc doesn't make you better then someone uses it. 3. No, that's a conclusion.. how would you get to such blog
[13:22:42] <Stoot> otherwise ? It's like looking for badweather news when the sun is shining and you feel bad yourself.
[13:22:55] <Stoot> *everyone
[13:23:00] <robertmaxrees> erm
[13:23:08] <robertmaxrees> 1 blog post does not a consensus make.
[13:23:28] <robertmaxrees> and that same post admist multiple times that there absolutely cases you don't need/want jquery :)
[13:24:00] <robertmaxrees> you're acting like i'm saying jquery is dead.  i'm not.  just that it solves a class of problem that is slowly fading away.  jquery will adapt over time.
[13:24:16] <Stoot> robertmaxrees welcome to online world, everyone tries to influence everyone, so it does.
[13:24:21] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[13:24:41] <robertmaxrees> alright duder.  not gonna play with personal attacks today.  chill out.,
[13:24:50] <Stoot> robertmaxrees I don't act like it at all and never said that... you are trying to force something into something that never happened
[13:25:30] <Stoot> robertmaxrees personal attacks ? get a green tea ? I don't know what happened but I don't feel attacked at all, I just make things clear when people see it wrong :)
[13:25:32] <robertmaxrees> this has devolved.  feel free to PM me if you want to continue talking about it.
[13:27:25] <Stoot> No, why ? if someone attacks someone, and the one that mentions it is not the one I trust to discuss that in private after the iventation (no offence ;)) it's better to keep things public. At the other side, I need to write some code and get some food :)
[13:27:32] <Stoot> so no time :)
[13:27:38] <robertmaxrees> please drop the subject.
[13:28:10] <Stoot> I think I already mentioned that by the green tea ;)
[13:28:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what that means.  it doesn't matter.  moving on!
[13:28:39] <Stoot> it;s somehting so you can chill out :)
[13:28:45] <Stoot> Zen baby
[13:28:53] <Stoot> oh lol
[15:35:34] <Flyste> I have a script that changes the src of an image 7 times to make a progression, is there a way to have all the images load before any part of the initial  page is displayed?
[15:36:04] <robertmaxrees> yes, but that's a strange thing to want to do.
[15:36:14] <Flyste> Why is that?
[15:36:15] <robertmaxrees> delaying page interactivity for a loading animation is a risky bet.
[15:37:32] <Flyste> What do you suggest to get this done properly?
[15:38:17] <robertmaxrees> i would question the idea entirely :)
[15:38:38] <robertmaxrees> adding weight for an animation like that seems strange.
[15:38:53] <robertmaxrees> is the page particularly slow already?
[15:39:18] <Flyste> Not particularly
[15:39:42] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  so why slow the entire page down for a single effect on a single image?
[15:40:54] <Flyste> Because someone asked me to do that
[15:41:40] <robertmaxrees> i might work with them to figure out why they want that.
[15:41:54] <robertmaxrees> generally we spend a lot of time trying to speed up page interactivity.  doing this is the exact opposite.
[15:59:00] <Stoot> could it be that $.inArray() works the opposite way and also not check all values in the array ? I use it in an if()
[15:59:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:59:34] <Stoot> yes that was what I thought as well
[15:59:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you mean by your question.
[15:59:46] <taplar> opposite to what?
[15:59:55] <taplar> and it doesn't have to check all values.
[16:00:19] <Stoot> it shows the not matching using the if
[16:00:32] <taplar> you do know that that method does not return a boolean, yes?
[16:00:33] <Stoot> taplar I have it in a loop, sorry
[16:00:36] <Stoot> if in a loop
[16:00:41] <robertmaxrees> so you want everything in the array that doesn't match a predicate?
[16:00:55] <taplar> can you make a fiddle with what you are trying?
[16:01:01] <Stoot> I just check if var is in the []
[16:01:12] <Stoot> yes I can!
[16:01:36] <Stoot> aha, it doesn't return a bool
[16:01:40] <taplar> nope
[16:01:57] <taplar> -1, not found
[16:03:18] <Stoot> ok, still not fully working, reading some more then making a fiddle
[16:05:07] <Stoot> mhh ok, I have it working but it's strange how it works in a loop, it seems to miss one array check then the if/else order is different
[16:05:22] <robertmaxrees> show your code :)
[16:05:25] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle.
[16:05:47] <Stoot> sec
[16:07:56] <Stoot> here you go, if I swap the if/else tRows it only applies to edit and not to delete, in this order it does to both https://jsfiddle.net/qvzbuwL4/
[16:08:09] <Stoot> an dthat with = 1 when swapped
[16:08:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:08:42] <Stoot> that is what I thought as well
[16:08:59] <robertmaxrees> no i mean, i can't understand what you mean.  can you make an actual test case?
[16:09:39] <Stoot> I could try, it's working now as it should tho
[16:09:49] <robertmaxrees> 'k.  also: avoid for loops
[16:10:08] <Stoot> in JS at all ?
[16:10:13] <robertmaxrees> yes
[16:10:20] <Stoot> yes I agree but this is some HTML parser
[16:10:24] <robertmaxrees> favor things like .forEach(), .map(), etc.
[16:10:25] <Stoot> so it creates a table
[16:10:32] <robertmaxrees> that doesn'
[16:10:37] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't mean anything lol
[16:10:37] <Stoot> yes it was not my work, need some later refactor
[16:10:44] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[16:10:56] <Stoot> I'm just adding the missing pieces everywhere
[16:11:18] <Stoot> and optimizing as much as possible, then I want to overlook all things like you say now
[16:11:47] <robertmaxrees> lol "optimizing as much as possible" -> "ignoring fixing some things'
[16:11:51] <Stoot> this way I added 2 order arrows :)
[16:12:24] <Stoot> robertmaxrees can't do everything @ JS at the moment, need to dive deeper as I did on PHP/DBAL, etc first
[16:13:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:14:20] <Stoot> yap, created my own fancy subframework into Zend Framework which is pretty nice and much cleaner and reusable code
[16:15:01] <Stoot> with query builder, etc
[16:15:24] <Stoot> works from top/bottom, so what you put into the view... can be picked up @ DBAL
