[00:05:17] <acriax> Cork: interesting. It seems one can't nest an anchor tag inside another anchor tag
[00:05:25] <Cork> ya
[00:05:27] <acriax> probably for safetys sake
[00:05:40] <acriax> even if it's an ul inside that other anchor
[00:05:41] <Cork> no it is cause even bubbling would make it messed up
[00:05:56] <Macaveli> Cork, to what items can you do "appendChild"
[00:06:09] <Cork> its similar to the fact that you can't have form inside another form
[00:06:28] <Cork> Macaveli: any element that isn't self closing
[00:06:34] <acriax> So I could change the top anchor to just a div or something, but do I have to resort to js to make it go somewhere on click?
[00:06:36] <Cork> like br, img, link and so on
[00:06:50] <Macaveli> Cork can't seem to add it to DIV
[00:07:00] <Cork> acriax: i would go by changing the structure a bit
[00:07:16] <Cork> acriax: do something like add a span around the link, let the span handle the mouseleave
[00:07:26] <acriax> ah right
[00:07:27] <Cork> acriax: and add the ul as a child of that span
[00:07:28] <acriax> that should work
[00:07:48] <Cork> Macaveli: you should
[00:07:53] <Cork> + be able to
[00:10:55] <Macaveli> Cork, https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/6318ea54dd44a4132a8e
[00:11:04] <Macaveli> TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'appendChild'
[00:11:12] <Cork> Macaveli: appendChild is a dom function
[00:11:16] <Cork> ?api append
[00:11:16] <b-ot> Cork: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[00:11:21] <Macaveli> Aaha
[00:12:00] <Macaveli> Cork that worked
[00:15:45] <And1> Anyone here who could help me with implementing (jquery.)history.js? Would be great if I'd get some hints, what I'm doing wrong.

[00:25:39] <Dev1L> I could use few bits of help with testing some stuff using mocha + chai
[00:44:45] <Snoopal> which is the earliest point/state to fire a jquery function?
[00:45:40] <systemfault> Snoopal: after 1) jQuery is loaded 2) The elements targeted by jQuery are parsed.
[00:46:17] <systemfault> Usually though… people don’t care and simply use $(document).ready/$(function() {})
[00:46:24] <Tekla> why would you want to run anything before the $(document).ready() state?
[00:46:49] <Snoopal> hm i got the "problem" that i have a div which only should be shown when mobile devices are accessing the page. this is a kind of overlay. on android this works fine but on ios first full page is shown and then i see the layer
[00:47:10] <Snoopal> which is wired because im doing a $(document).ready(function() {} ); right aufter jquery is initiated
[00:48:23] <systemfault> Snoopal: The execution of everything in a ready function is deferred to when the document is entirely parsed (DOM ready)
[00:49:19] <Snoopal> if i put a $(function(){ .... }); <-- earlier?
[00:53:10] <systemfault> No, it’s an alias to .ready
[00:55:54] <Snoopal> k thx
[00:55:56] <Snoopal> damnit
[00:56:33] <Tekla> Snoopal: i'm pretty sure it's been solved b4 :)
[01:05:14] <jomofcw> Hello !
[01:05:33] <jomofcw> Is there an easy way to get a params in the URL (GET parameter) using jQuery core ?
[01:05:47] <Cork> jomofcw: window.location.search
[01:06:08] <Cork> you need to parse the string your self though
[01:06:24] <jomofcw> Hello Cork ! OK thanks I will give it a look.
[01:09:26] <ocx> hi all   PushNotification.registerForNotificationTypes(PushNotification.notificationType.badge |            PushNotification.notificationType.sound |            PushNotification.notificationType.alert) < can someone explain to me what is the |
[01:17:26] <ocx> anyone?
[01:17:31] <Merko> Hi. Is there an easy way to make an array with this code, to make it loop through different images? (Example 1-4)?
[01:17:34] <Merko> http://pastebin.com/uQX49VPv  *
[01:18:16] <Cork> Merko: sure, just create a function and have it change the url
[01:18:43] <Cork> Merko: and have it recursively call it self from the fadeTo function
[01:19:10] <Merko> Hm. :/ sounds tricky. Really new to webcoding.  I'll try figure it out though. thanks.
[01:25:24] <ocx> hi Cork what is the use of that | ?
[01:25:29] <ocx> it is not an OR is it
[01:25:40] <Cork> bitwise or
[01:25:49] <Cork> || is logical
[01:26:32] <ocx> Cork: i mean 1 |
[01:26:40] <Cork> huh?
[01:26:42] <ocx>    PushNotification.registerForNotificationTypes(PushNotification.notificationType.badge |            PushNotification.notificationType.sound |            PushNotification.notificationType.alert) <
[01:26:54] <Cork> ocx: i said already
[01:26:56] <Cork> bitwise or
[01:27:07] <Cork> || is logical or
[01:27:12] <ocx> thank you
[01:27:43] <ocx> Cork: is this a correct way of adding some html from javascript? var $removeButton = $("<input type='button' class='removeTagButton' value='Remove' />")
[01:27:57] <Cork> it's one of the ways you can do it
[01:28:09] <Cork> and you add elements, not html
[01:41:23] <frojnd> Hi there.
[01:42:36] <frojnd> Does anyone here have any experience with filling data from div into local database?
[01:44:04] <frojnd> I've created two separate things: 1) rest client (a few lines) that is fetching data from github on button click event and it's showing this data in div. 2) I've created simple todo list that stores data from input to local database. I'm trying to combine these two things so when user clicks on a submit button and rest client fethes data from rest service, this data will also be stored in local database
[01:52:30] <frojnd> http://jsbin.com/kuvim/1/edit can someone check what's wrong with my code it won't save into database?
[01:55:04] <wa5ted> man has the #jquery landscape changed since i was last here
[01:55:21] <wa5ted> none of the regulars are here
[01:55:22] <CrowX-> wa5ted, what's different
[01:55:30] <wa5ted> the people isued to talk to
[01:55:31] <jomofcw> Cork about my last question (for window.location.search) is there a url_decode/url_encode functions like in PHP, please ?
[01:55:37] <frojnd> ofcourse has changed :) more newbies around <---
[01:55:43] <wa5ted> lol
[01:55:49] <wa5ted> get out your noobs! XD
[01:55:55] <wa5ted> Cork is still around
[01:55:57] <Cork> jomofcw: not natively no
[01:55:57] <CrowX-> I made a simple slider that basically changes the src of the image, and it works fine. How do I animate the switching of images?
[01:55:58] <wa5ted> raj: yes
[01:56:03] <wa5ted> raj is still around
[01:56:17] <wa5ted> jphase and jedimind are gone
[01:56:32] <Cork> wa5ted: i saw them just a few days ago
[01:56:33] <wa5ted> shoky: shoky is still here
[01:56:35] <frojnd> I'm around with newbie questions :)
[01:56:57] <wa5ted> Cork: oh really, when was jedimind around
[01:57:02] <wa5ted> havent seen him in ages
[01:57:19] <wa5ted> Velveeta must be asleep
[01:57:24] <jomofcw> Cork it seems I could use this : http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_decodeuricomponent.asp
[01:57:53] <wa5ted> frojnd: glad to help if i can
[01:58:29] <Cork> wa5ted: don't remember the exact day, but it wasn't too long ago
[01:58:45] <wa5ted> anyone have an github accoutn under the name mstoppert
[01:58:47] <Cork> jphase was last week
[01:58:53] <dwarder> if i click on text2 http://jsfiddle.net/M66T2/ i got text1 text2 text3 and text4 become red, how do i make them become color like text0 if i click again on text2 or text1 or text3 or text4?
[01:59:00] <wa5ted> Cork: ya jphase i got, spoke to him 2 days ago
[01:59:08] <wa5ted> jedimind
[01:59:11] <wa5ted> has been missing
[01:59:14] <frojnd> wa5ted: well if you have a minute for me I'd be glad if you could check my code.
[01:59:31] <Cork> wa5ted: from ns, Last seen  : Mar 13 12:29:10 2014 (2 weeks, 3 days, 20:28:34 ago)
[01:59:32] <wa5ted> frojnd: for sure
[01:59:43] <wa5ted> Cork: what was that
[01:59:53] <Cork> wa5ted: /ns info <nick>
[01:59:59] <wa5ted> aight
[02:00:34] <frojnd> wa5ted: it created databse just fine, I've just tested it. But something is worng with saving data when clicking button to a table
[02:00:37] <wa5ted> frojnd: so you want the red clicked links to turn blue again if i click something blue
[02:01:31] <frojnd> wa5ted: I don't see any rec links or blue
[02:01:44] <wa5ted> sry my bad
[02:01:45] <frojnd> wa5ted: http://jsbin.com/kuvim/1/edit that's the link I pasted
[02:01:45] <wa5ted> wrong person
[02:01:53] <frojnd> no worries
[02:02:07] <wa5ted> dwarder: will be with you in a few
[02:02:29] <wa5ted> frojnd: so hat is wrong?
[02:02:34] <wa5ted> what is the intended behaviour
[02:02:43] <wa5ted> and what is the behaviour your getting
[02:03:38] <frojnd> wa5ted: when I load code, databse is successful initiated. When I click on a button, I get rest response. This part is wokring. But I'd like this output which is in div class="output" to be saved i na table so next time I open site without connection, I could see Linus Torvalds
[02:04:17] <frojnd> wa5ted: I've took this database example from: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webdatabase/todo/ and tried to combine it with my rest client
[02:04:35] <wa5ted> offline data bases not bad
[02:04:44] <wa5ted> damn it im out of touch from jquery and web for a long time
[02:04:57] <frojnd> only difference would be I I'm using a button for a data to show on a html div and then store it in database
[02:05:05] <frojnd> wa5ted: not more than me, I'm just starting :)
[02:05:15] <wa5ted> lol
[02:05:26] <wa5ted> dont you think this stuff is a bit high level for  a starter
[02:05:28] <wa5ted> jsut saying
[02:05:28] <frojnd> It's a bit hard all the net technology, ajax, rest, dom, jquery, :D
[02:05:35] <wa5ted> i know
[02:05:41] <frojnd> wa5ted: I've been feedling for the last week
[02:05:55] <frojnd> so I know something just don't know too well so I could do it by myself
[02:06:05] <wa5ted> have you tried converting html5's js code ot jquery?
[02:06:07] <wa5ted> to*
[02:06:23] <wa5ted> shouldnt make a differnce but
[02:06:28] <frojnd> nope
[02:06:53] <wa5ted> hmmmm
[02:06:54] <frojnd> wa5ted: the hardest part is
[02:07:01] <frojnd> taking data when I cluick on a button and store it into a table
[02:07:11] <wa5ted> actually that is the easy part
[02:07:13] <wa5ted> my guess
[02:07:19] <wa5ted> is itsnot getting saved to the data base
[02:07:25] <wa5ted> have you verified that this is working
[02:07:44] <frojnd> doing it now with console.log("calls :P "=
[02:07:56] <wa5ted> dont :P
[02:07:58] <frojnd> console.log("calls :p ");
[02:08:00] <wa5ted> thats the way you do it
[02:08:12] <wa5ted> all the way through just output
[02:08:17] <wa5ted> if something fails you know why
[02:08:41] <wa5ted> mstoppert anyone
[02:08:41] <dwarder> wa5ted: in a few hours? ;)
[02:08:51] <wa5ted> oh no
[02:08:53] <wa5ted> dwarder
[02:09:00] <wa5ted> what is yourintended behaviour
[02:09:04] <wa5ted> and what are you getting
[02:09:17] <dwarder> wa5ted: well, i think i know how to solve it
[02:09:24] <dwarder> wa5ted: let me try again
[02:09:24] <wa5ted> aight
[02:09:28] <wa5ted> sure
[02:09:44] <wa5ted> dwarder: i might ehad to bed soon
[02:09:50] <wa5ted> its early morning here so
[02:18:53] <frojnd> hm
[02:18:56] <frojnd> can't figure it out why
[02:19:03] <frojnd> it won't insert into a table
[02:19:19] <frojnd> it creates db successfully, it creates table, but it wont insert
[02:21:20] <frojnd> it ignores the part when I click on a button it should get elementByClassName("output") but it ignores it
[02:22:35] <frojnd> The only difference is in html
[02:23:45] <frojnd> on a working part I have: html section: <form type="post" onsubmit="addTodo(); return false;">
[02:24:02] <frojnd> this is where this post is happening but I don't need that "post" since I only have a button
[02:24:12] <frojnd> wa5ted: here? or in bed already :)
[02:24:20] <wa5ted> in bd=ed
[02:24:25] <wa5ted> jks
[02:24:42] <wa5ted> id debug from there
[02:24:47] <wa5ted> try usbmitting a querry
[02:24:53] <wa5ted> right after you create the table
[02:24:57] <wa5ted> immediately after
[02:24:59] <frojnd> so basically in my code: http://jsbin.com/kuvim/1/edit I don't have <form type="post" onsubmit="addTodo(); return false;">
[02:25:00] <wa5ted> and see if it works
[02:25:03] <wa5ted> if i t does
[02:25:08] <wa5ted> something wrong wtih click even
[02:25:10] <wa5ted> event
[02:25:23] <wa5ted> frojnd: why not create a regualr button
[02:25:29] <wa5ted> that does an ajax query
[02:25:37] <frojnd> wa5ted: tell me tell me
[02:25:38] <wa5ted> and ignores default button action
[02:26:01] <wa5ted> well here try this first
[02:26:16] <wa5ted> frojnd: submit a db query right after createingthe db
[02:26:35] <wa5ted> and insert db query
[02:26:38] <wa5ted> see what happens
[02:27:05] <dwarder> i have an element that i clicked (<li class='one'>) and i want to .wrapAll  4 next elements with the same class, how can i do this?
[02:27:46] <dwarder> including the one i clicked too
[02:27:49] <wa5ted> so basically if you lick somethign with .one
[02:27:56] <dwarder> lick?
[02:27:58] <wa5ted> you want all the .one to change color for exmaple
[02:28:02] <wa5ted> click*
[02:28:11] <wa5ted> example*
[02:28:15] <frojnd> wa5ted: but  I think I have problem with fetching data from html and use it in javascript/jquery
[02:28:15] <dwarder> wa5ted: not all .one , only the next 4
[02:28:26] <dwarder> wa5ted: if i have 10 in a row
[02:28:47] <dwarder> wa5ted: and i clicked on the second i want 2,3,4,5,6 be wrapped
[02:28:55] <dwarder> wa5ted: inside a div for example
[02:28:57] <wa5ted> what if im on the 9th
[02:29:14] <wa5ted> does the 10, 1 ,2 ,3 ,4
[02:29:15] <dwarder> wa5ted: then don't select anything
[02:29:30] <wa5ted> okay so only if for sure it has next 4 lelemens
[02:29:33] <wa5ted> elements right
[02:29:36] <dwarder> wa5ted: right
[02:29:45] <wa5ted> frojnd: what happened when you did query immediately?
[02:30:07] <wa5ted> oaky so here is what id do
[02:30:10] <wa5ted> do a check first of all
[02:30:22] <wa5ted> say there are 10 elements
[02:30:26] <wa5ted> dwarder:
[02:30:40] <dwarder> wa5ted: i don't know how to merge this 5 objects together to apply .wrappal on it
[02:30:50] <wa5ted> well what we will do
[02:30:53] <wa5ted> is runa loop
[02:30:54] <dwarder> wa5ted: that is the only problem
[02:31:01] <wa5ted> starting with te clicked elment and change color that way
[02:31:18] <wa5ted> or do you have ot use wrappall
[02:31:22] <wa5ted> .wrapall
[02:31:49] <wa5ted> frojnd: did my insert query work when you made one right after creating table
[02:31:55] <dwarder> wa5ted: yup  .wappall   <div><li class="one"><li class="one "....... </div>
[02:32:01] <wa5ted> hmmm
[02:32:08] <wa5ted> the loop idea would work but hmmmmm
[02:32:15] <wa5ted> never had to use wrapall
[02:32:18] <wa5ted> let me think
[02:34:24] <dwarder> wa5ted: sure
[02:34:36] <wa5ted> i dunno if ill get an answer
[02:34:37] <gry> you're all a bit more readable now, which is good
[02:34:40] <wa5ted> honestly i mso tired
[02:34:53] <wa5ted> honestly i am so tired
[02:34:56] <wa5ted> gry: what?
[02:35:16] <dwarder> wa5ted: .add() ?
[02:35:27] <wa5ted> perhaps
[02:40:20] <frojnd> wa5ted: I don't know how to insert query
[02:43:43] <frojnd> i mean, after table creaion
[02:46:52] <wa5ted> well exactly how you do it on lcick
[02:46:54] <wa5ted> click
[02:49:06] <frojnd> oh I see where I have diffs
[02:49:21] <wa5ted> aight
[02:49:47] <frojnd> the original database code: http://jsbin.com/yusaj/1/edit has <form type="post" onsubmit="addTodo(); return fasle; "> this is within html
[02:50:16] <frojnd> so within html is decalired to call tfunction addTodo that fetches data from id and stores it into database
[02:50:24] <frojnd> in my case I don't have this in html
[02:50:43] <frojnd> http://jsbin.com/kuvim/1/edit <-- my code
[02:50:59] <frojnd> just that I don't know how to do similar stuff for my case :)
[02:52:06] <dwarder> what is the opposite to .wrapAll?
[02:52:15] <Cork> wrap?
[02:52:26] <Cork> or what do you mean opposite?
[02:53:48] <dwarder> Cork: unWrapAll ;)
[02:54:01] <dwarder> Cork: i think i can do this $(".outerDiv").replaceWith(function () { return $(this).html(); });
[02:54:01] <Cork> dwarder: there is no unwrap call for all i think
[02:54:27] <Cork> uh
[02:54:29] <Cork> no
[02:54:33] <dwarder> no?
[02:54:43] <Cork> that will regenerate all the content
[02:54:47] <Cork> the dom will be removed
[02:54:59] <dwarder> Cork: jQuery('.classname').children().unwrap();
[02:55:02] <dwarder> ?
[02:55:12] <dwarder> no
[02:55:21] <dwarder> that is what i am looking at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13619377/jquery-wrapall-function-inverse
[02:55:36] <dwarder> the exact problem i have
[02:55:39] <Cork> var group = $('.selectors'), parent = group.parent(); parent.after(group); parent.remove()
[02:56:14] <Cork> dwarder: basically i never use wrap/unwrap and company
[02:56:26] <frojnd> yes, I've added onclick="addTodo()" for a button so now it goes into addTodo() function. It does not save to table yet but it's a progress :)
[02:56:30] <Cork> cause they cause unpredictable behavior
[02:56:58] <Cork> frojnd: you really should move your js out of your html
[02:57:29] <frojnd> Cork: onclick="function()" is javascript code?
[02:57:46] <Cork> no it is really old dom0 event code
[02:58:08] <frojnd> what should I use instead?
[02:58:13] <Cork> event listeners
[02:58:27] <frojnd> aha
[02:58:30] <Cork> jquery provides helpers for it through .on and .bind
[02:58:37] <frojnd> so I just set id in html and write event in js?
[02:58:37] <Cork> (and delegate)
[02:58:44] <Cork> for example yet
[02:58:46] <Cork> _*yes
[02:58:56] <Cork> or you can use relative selectors or...
[02:59:05] <frojnd> Cork: something easy would be nice :)
[02:59:23] <Cork> do you have more then one of these buttons, that do the same thing?
[02:59:25] <frojnd> beceause I have a lot of stuff currently in my learning web technologies
[02:59:31] <frojnd> Cork: just one button
[02:59:41] <Cork> then an id is prob the best option
[02:59:42] <frojnd> Cork: http://jsbin.com/kuvim/1/edit
[03:00:23] <frojnd> Cork: I have one problem :) with wa5ted we managed to insert data into a table :)
[03:00:27] <frojnd> if you look that code
[03:00:46] <wa5ted> why do you have a problem with me?
[03:00:48] <wa5ted> what idd i do
[03:00:50] <wa5ted> did
[03:00:52] <wa5ted> grrrrrrr
[03:00:54] <wa5ted> XD
[03:00:56] <dwarder> Cork: thank you
[03:01:02] <frojnd> but, it won't insert anything, it will insert empty "" because if you look at console you can see that adding data is beinc called before rest :D
[03:01:13] <frojnd> wa5ted: you helped me :)
[03:01:18] <wa5ted> lol
[03:01:21] <Cork> frojnd: also note that websql isn't cross browser
[03:01:28] <wa5ted> yh
[03:01:28] <frojnd> wa5ted: if you click o na button, you can see Linus Torvalds
[03:01:35] <wa5ted> i know
[03:01:39] <wa5ted> i can see it
[03:01:42] <frojnd> wa5ted: the only problem is, that insertion happens before rest call :)
[03:01:47] <wa5ted> true
[03:01:52] <frojnd> so I must somehow fix this
[03:01:56] <wa5ted> and listen to what Cork is saying
[03:02:01] <wa5ted> actually
[03:02:01] <frojnd> yes both
[03:02:05] <wa5ted> just saying
[03:02:18] <frojnd> Cork: I know about websql and cross browsers..
[03:02:24] <wa5ted> https://www.meteor.com/
[03:02:26] <wa5ted> ^check that out
[03:02:33] <wa5ted> i dunno
[03:02:38] <wa5ted> if it mets your needs
[03:02:42] <wa5ted> and its totally random
[03:02:47] <wa5ted> but its fucking awesome
[03:02:50] <wa5ted> sry to swear
[03:03:06] <frojnd> no biggie :)
[03:03:07] <wa5ted> coolest thing i have ever seen
[03:03:11] <frojnd> I'll defenetely use it
[03:03:22] <frojnd> but first I'd like to finish this thing I'm trying to achieve
[03:03:24] <wa5ted> you mentioned dbs and js and ajax and php and such
[03:03:25] <wa5ted> so
[03:03:26] <frojnd> I'm "that" close :)
[03:03:28] <wa5ted> lol
[03:03:34] <wa5ted> dunno
[03:03:58] <frojnd> wa5ted: if you look at my code
[03:04:01] <frojnd> "updated" one
[03:04:14] <wa5ted> i know im lookign im too tired XD
[03:04:18] <wa5ted> lol it looks like a blur
[03:04:22] <frojnd> why is insertion into table happening before rest request/response ?
[03:04:25] <wa5ted> ill try
[03:04:33] <wa5ted> dunno
[03:04:47] <frojnd> or Cork :) I'd appreciate your help
[03:05:33] <frojnd> hm if I update code on jsbin does other user get updated version with the same uri?
[03:05:52] <Dogamondo> hey guys
[03:05:54] <Cork> frojnd: yes you update it live
[03:06:04] <frojnd> ok
[03:06:04] <Cork> frojnd: if you reload the url and edit again you get a new number
[03:06:13] <frojnd> ok
[03:06:22] <frojnd> http://jsbin.com/kuvim/1/edit
[03:06:27] <frojnd> that's the latest update
[03:07:18] <frojnd> it has console.logs in it so I was able that insertion into table happens before rest request which is not ok because then I can't save data into table, I save empty ""
[03:07:20] <Dogamondo> can anyone recommend me a good jquery slider that I can put a bunch of logos on, and it will visually queue them up so that the middle item becomes the hero as it slides into prime position?
[03:07:43] <Dogamondo> kind like this
[03:07:52] <Dogamondo> - - - [ ] - - -
[03:08:50] <Cork> Dogamondo: from your description i think you mean slideshow not slider
[03:09:06] <Dogamondo> Cork: yes I thnk so, was unsure what to call it
[03:09:30] <Cork> Dogamondo: sadly enough many slideshow plugins for jquery call them self sliders
[03:09:42] <Cork> and totally ignores that there already is a widget called slider...
[03:10:50] <Cork> Dogamondo: and there should be a long list of those if you search
[03:10:58] <Cork> Dogamondo: sadly enough most of them are badly coded
[03:11:53] <Dogamondo> ok thanks Cork, I’ll have a search around
[03:12:11] <frojnd> wa5ted: any luck?
[03:12:18] <wa5ted> no bro
[03:15:30] <frojnd> Cork: me and wa5ted (well especially me :p) would apprecieate if you could check code and see why is insertion into database being processed before rest call and how can we easily fix this so response from rest would go into a database
[03:15:49] <wa5ted> bro just you
[03:15:51] <wa5ted> i didnt do jack
[03:15:53] <wa5ted> so
[03:16:03] <wa5ted> Cork is good he can definitely help
[03:18:04] <dwarder> how do i have a elemnt list that is inside a div?
[03:18:06] <frojnd> Cork: is a fine dude, hope there will be time for help
[03:18:59] <dwarder> .children
[03:19:04] <dwarder> that is
[03:20:34] <Cork> frojnd: what is the problem your trying to handle?
[03:23:56] <frojnd> Cork: I'm trying to fetch data from div class="output" AFTER rest service call. So first when user clicks ona button output is being showed under button. And then use this output and store it into a table.
[03:24:31] <Cork> frojnd: all i get is "Fail"
[03:24:38] <Cork> the ajax call doesn't work
[03:24:42] <frojnd> where you see that?
[03:24:51] <Cork> under the button after it's clicked
[03:25:06] <frojnd> http://jsbin.com/kuvim/1/edit <- this link yes?
[03:25:20] <Cork> yes
[03:25:37] <Cork> ah, sorry see what happens now
[03:26:12] <Cork> so you want the response message stored in the database?
[03:26:16] <frojnd> yes
[03:26:28] <frojnd> most of the code is aleady there working
[03:26:51] <frojnd> the main problem is to store response message into database in this case "Linus Torvalds"
[03:27:23] <Cork> so ourdatabase.webdb.addTodo(response.name); ?
[03:28:23] <frojnd> I'm not sure
[03:29:26] <frojnd> Cork: but yeah something like this
[03:33:28] <frojnd> Cork: I can't see function addTodo() { ... } being called anywhere so before I added onButtonClick in html
[03:34:27] <Cork> frojnd: ya, i don't see any use of it
[03:34:44] <Cork> frojnd: on the other hand it uses value from a div
[03:34:49] <Cork> so not sure what it is meant to do
[03:35:09] <frojnd> function should take data from html and store it into ourdatabase.webdb.addTodo()
[03:35:38] <frojnd> Cork: here is the working example of this database: http://jsbin.com/yusaj/1/edit
[03:36:27] <frojnd> Cork: but that's just database part. I need to combine this with my code from here: http://jsbin.com/kuvim/1/edit
[03:36:46] <Cork> combine?
[03:37:01] <frojnd> merge
[03:37:13] <Cork> i don't follow
[03:37:25] <frojnd> well I have rest calls
[03:37:27] <Cork> you want to grab what is in the div and put it into the database?
[03:37:32] <frojnd> yes
[03:37:44] <frojnd> that's what I'm trying to do
[03:37:49] <Cork> you want innerHTML then
[03:37:50] <Cork> not value
[03:38:03] <frojnd> and what's in div gets from rest response
[03:38:20] <Cork> why store it in the dom and then extracting it from the dom?
[03:38:26] <Cork> just store the data you have directly
[03:38:52] <frojnd> Cork: how do I do that?
[03:39:04] <Cork> frojnd: the code i gave you a few mins ago
[03:40:14] <frojnd> 12:26 < Cork> so ourdatabase.webdb.addTodo(response.name); this code?
[03:40:20] <bristleback> Hi!
[03:40:21] <Cork> yes
[03:41:27] <frojnd> Cork: don't kow what would response.name be
[03:41:41] <Cork> frojnd: its in your ajax callback handler
[03:41:42] <bristleback> I have the following problem: I have a modal form that contains dinamically added elements. A user opens the modal forms and then adds or removes rows in a table. To close the modal form, the user can choose between "Close" and "Save
[03:42:24] <frojnd> Cork: and I can call it even if it's in a ajax callback handler outside of the handler?
[03:42:48] <Cork> frojnd: uh, response is sent to the done callback
[03:42:56] <bristleback> since close should not save the changes in the form, I want to make a copy of the entire html, events included, and overwrite that html when the user chooses to save that form
[03:43:40] <bristleback> the problem is that if I use window.general_option = $("#general-option-form").html(), I will not have the events included
[03:43:54] <Cork> bristleback: html is just text
[03:44:04] <Cork> it doesn't keep states or anything like that
[03:44:51] <Cork> also a better option is prob to hide the element with a class
[03:44:56] <Cork> and on save remove those elements
[03:44:58] <bristleback> on the other hand, if I do window.general_option = $("#general-option-form").clone(), when I change the modal, window.general_option will also be changed automatically
[03:45:05] <Cork> that way you just have to remove the class to revert
[03:45:16] <Cork> and a $('.to_be_removed').remove() to save
[03:45:33] <bristleback> good idea
[03:45:40] <bristleback> thanks
[03:47:35] <frojnd> Cork: I'm lost I don't know where to paste that lin  ourdatabase.webdb.addTodo(response.name);
[03:48:48] <Cork> frojnd: you see where you have user.done
[03:48:52] <Cork> inside that callback
[03:48:56] <frojnd> yes
[03:49:45] <frojnd> I've added it but I don't see any "Linus Torvalds" after I refresh page
[03:50:08] <Cork> frojnd: call the getAllItems or what it's called
[03:50:12] <Cork> and check what data you get out
[03:51:54] <ocx> Cork: if i load a javascript jquery library in index.html than call an href to page.html will the javascript file be avialble to be called by page.html?
[03:51:57] <ocx> i am using jqm
[03:52:21] <Cork> ocx: not automatically no
[03:52:45] <Cork> ocx: jqm tries to uses ajax to fetch pages
[03:52:46] <ocx> Cork: i should call it from the page.html
[03:52:47] <ocx> ?
[03:52:49] <Cork> and modify it inline
[03:52:59] <Cork> when that happens old js stays active
[03:53:28] <Cork> ocx: you might need to yes, but i'm far from an expert on jqm
[03:53:46] <ocx> where can i find jqm experts
[03:54:55] <frojnd> Cork: ourdatabase.webdb.getAllTodoItemsTodoItems(loadTodoItems) ? but where do I call it?
[03:55:23] <ocx> Cork: like for example i am using this in page.html http://pastebin.com/msbK5mhG , that PushNotification is defined in index.html
[03:55:32] <Cork> kan inte just nu
[04:00:11] <frojnd> Cork: please help me :)
[04:09:35] <frojnd> ah well I guess I'm not gonna finish this task anytime soon
[04:13:52] <larsemil> is it not possible to add content like this: http://jsfiddle.net/YrXvx/3/
[04:14:24] <Cork> larsemil: js doesn't allow line breaks in strings
[04:14:31] <larsemil> ah!
[04:17:29] <frojnd> Cork: what do I have to give you so you can help me :) I know I'm newbie but I also know I'm "that" close to solve this problem
[04:17:41] <larsemil> Cork: the one thing i did not try. :)
[04:19:16] <Cork> frojnd: you should start by testing what you need to do with the database first
[04:19:37] <Cork> frojnd: when you get that working and are satisfied with it, start fiddling with the ajax
[04:20:08] <frojnd> Cork: database is working fine, I have problem with ajax
[04:20:27] <Cork> frojnd: what part of the ajax do you have problem with?
[04:20:27] <frojnd> Cork: I've puted console.logs in various parts to check if it's going through
[04:20:34] <Cork> the data is coming back just fine
[04:21:21] <frojnd> the one when user clicks on a button and rest event is happened. I don't know where or how to save rest response into a table. First I tried with dome, but you suggested that that's not a good ideas since there more overload
[04:21:43] <frojnd> there is more overhead*
[04:22:21] <frojnd> Cork: data from table? it's empty
[04:22:42] <Cork> frojnd: so, again your database code is the browser
[04:22:45] <Cork> not the ajax
[04:22:51] <Cork> *problem
[04:22:53] <Cork> not browser...
[04:23:05] <Cork> cause the data comes through ajax jsut fine
[04:23:52] <frojnd> Cork: it  opens database and it creates table that part is working
[04:24:30] <Cork> frojnd: yes, but i talked about the part of pushing and getting data from it
[04:24:32] <frojnd> Cork: but it won't insert data into table
[04:24:46] <Cork> yes, so the problem is with your database code, not ajax
[04:31:04] <frojnd> aha ok, so the part where adding data to table is called ourdatabase.wedb.addTodo = function(todoText) { ... } which in my case is never being called. Because this pa rt is being called within function addTodo() the last part of the code
[04:31:33] <frojnd> but you told me to just insert ourdatabase.wedb.addTodo(response.name) within user.done callback
[04:31:39] <frojnd> so now I'm confused
[04:32:32] <Cork> frojnd: yes, that should add the data to the database
[04:32:36] <Cork> as long as the code there works
[04:32:42] <Cork> frojnd: that is why i said start there
[04:32:57] <santiissopasse> im writing a chrome extension and want to listen for any ajax calls that are made. ive tried $(document).bind("ajaxComplete" function(){}), and $(document).ajaxComplete(function(){}) and $.ajax({ajaxComplete: function()) but none of these seem to catch the events. is there somethign im missing about how this works?
[04:34:41] <Cork> santiissopasse: is the ajax call made with jquery?
[04:35:08] <Cork> santiissopasse: those events won't work if the call isn't made with jquery
[04:35:12] <santiissopasse> Cork: no idea, im injecting the script into all sorts of webpages, facebook, gmail, blogs etc. so it could be anything
[04:35:34] <santiissopasse> Cork: ah ok, so is there any way to listen for all sorts of Ajax calls?
[04:35:41] <Cork> those events are fake events that jquery generates when it's callbacks fires
[04:35:44] <Cork> no
[04:36:03] <Cork> you would have to get your hand on the original xhr object
[04:36:11] <Cork> before they made the send call
[04:37:29] <santiissopasse> Cork: how would I do that?
[04:38:10] <Cork> santiissopasse: you could try replacing the xmlHTTPRequest object
[04:38:17] <Cork> and in the wrapper hook into it
[04:38:41] <Cork> santiissopasse: but that might be leakish, so you might need to look for an api hook in the browser
[04:38:46] <santiissopasse> Cork: ok, ill look into that
[04:38:54] <le_gars> Hi! What do you generally prefer, $.load or $.ajax? or case to case?
[04:39:32] <Cork> le_gars: ajax is the base function
[04:39:33] <le_gars> It seems as thought the latter have more error handling?
[04:39:44] <Cork> it is basically what all ajax based functions use internally
[04:39:51] <Cork> load is for loading html into a specific element
[04:39:54] <Cork> not much else
[04:40:23] <Cork> $.post and $.get is two shorthands for $.ajax
[04:40:27] <Cork> $.getScript is another
[04:40:37] <Cork> $.getJSON is yet another
[04:41:23] <HelperW> yo
[04:41:34] <HelperW> I am trying to create a ajax search
[04:41:52] <HelperW> I can see my  live search in the cnosole but I am not able to display the rsults in the browser
[04:41:59] <HelperW> Im am not sure what I am doing wrong :s
[04:42:12] <HelperW> http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/wG
[04:42:12] <le_gars> yea, well we had some problems a while back where we got some chuncked connection encoding from the server in the headers and we had a method in js that used $.load for loading html. And we got the chunked connection output in the DOM
[04:42:16] <HelperW> Thisi s what I have currently.
[04:43:00] <HelperW> And the success handler is parsing me the results.
[04:43:41] <le_gars> Would have liked yo incorporate som error handling on the front that would not load the content into the DOM if we had that kind of strange headers.
[04:44:14] <le_gars> rellay strange never seen anything like that.
[04:45:38] <Cork> le_gars: so use $.get().done().fail()
[04:45:45] <Cork> or $.ajax() if you prefer
[04:46:24] <frojnd> Cork: how would I check what's the content of ourdatabase.wedb.addTodo(response.name) ? because ourdatabase.webdb.addTodo = function(todoText) { ... } is being called
[04:46:50] <Cork> frojnd: console.log(response.name)
[04:46:56] <Cork> in at the same place
[04:47:08] <Cork> frojnd: but that is what you put in the dom
[04:47:16] <Cork> so you already know what it is
[04:47:18] <le_gars> Cork: Sp you would recommend those before load?
[04:47:27] <le_gars> I mean in this case
[04:47:28] <frojnd> yeah it's name and surname
[04:47:42] <Cork> le_gars: yes, if you want to check what the response is before you add it to the page
[04:48:31] <le_gars> ok great, cheers
[04:51:54] <frojnd> Cork: for some reason ourdatabase.webdb.addTodo = function(todoText) { ... } is called before ourdatabase.webdb.addTodo(response.name); <--which is in user.done callback
[04:52:19] <Cork> frojnd: you have the link again?
[04:52:29] <frojnd> http://jsbin.com/kuvim/1/edit <- here Cork
[04:52:55] <frojnd> check for "bla" and "adding data" in console
[04:52:57] <titii> Hi there, I have 2 plugins (my own), instances, var user = new $.user(); and var chat1 = new $.chat1($('.chat1')); i am doing outside in common script, but i need to working with that instance of plugin1 /user/ and its properties in plugin2 /chat1/, how it is possible? Because I got an error Reference error: user is not defined in scipt of chat1.js
[04:53:15] <Cork> ugg
[04:53:21] <Cork> now i remember why i hate jsbin...
[04:54:34] <titii> Cork, bro, can u help me?
[04:54:58] <Cork> frojnd: i can't see how that would be possible
[04:55:06] <Cork> nothing else is calling that function
[04:55:11] <Cork> ?ask @ titii
[04:55:11] <b-ot> titii: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:55:51] <titii> :) ok i am waiting...
[04:57:16] <frojnd> me neither
[04:58:00] <Cork> frojnd: wait, it's in the right order here
[04:58:18] <Cork> create table > data from table > done > adding data > bla ...
[04:58:24] <Cork> that is in code order
[05:02:20] <frojnd> Cork: ah ok. It's ok since console.log("bla ..:"); is being called after adding data
[05:02:34] <Cork> yes
[05:02:41] <frojnd> so data is being put inside table
[05:03:14] <Cork> no the code that should put the data in the database is called
[05:03:19] <Cork> you need to make sure it actually is
[05:03:49] <frojnd> I don't nknow how can I check against database if it's really there
[05:04:07] <frojnd> I just use console.log for printing content out :P
[05:04:30] <Cork> well make a select query and check what you get back
[05:11:36] <iaj> Hi there... I need a hand here..
[05:11:41] <iaj> Trying to get this to work: jQuery(".multicolumnLayout2 .column1 img, .multicolumnLayout2 .column2 img, .multicolumnLayout2 .column3 img").wrap("<a class="test">");
[05:11:54] <iaj> However the <a> is not getting attached if I assign a class to it?
[05:13:15] <Tekla> it might be stupid but maybe don't expect jquery to know you want nested ""s
[05:15:35] <ocx> Cork: do you see anything suspecious in this code? http://pastebin.com/5eWbpt0Q
[05:16:09] <Cork> ocx: ya, obj.tags.indexOf(["c"],1)
[05:16:10] <mdev> how do I loop through all elements, I want to check their name and then do stuff if it's the one i'm after
[05:16:21] <mdev> but don't want to know ahead of time of it's an input or whatever
[05:16:25] <ocx> yea i get thats wrong, what is wrong with ti
[05:16:48] <Cork> ocx: [] will create a new array each time
[05:16:58] <Cork> so it won't ever match the array in the tag list
[05:17:14] <Cork> ocx: basically you can't compare arrays and object based on the content in them
[05:17:15] <ocx> Cork: so should be obj.tags.indexOf("c",1)  ?
[05:17:23] <frojnd> Cork: http://jsbin.com/kuvim/1/edit is it normal I see [object databse] in console? After adding select * from userstable ? inside ourdatabse.webdb.addTodo = function(todoText) {...} ?
[05:17:28] <Cork> if tags is an array of strings yes
[05:17:49] <Cork> frojnd: yes, you have to loop the content in it
[05:18:17] <frojnd> Cork: like regular loop in javascript like for (prop in obj) ?
[05:18:19] <ocx> Cork: var tag = $("#addTagField").val()
[05:18:33] <Cork> frojnd: you would have to check the documentation for websql
[05:18:55] <Cork> i don't have that data on hand, as i normally don't use webkit only code
[05:19:25] <Cork> ocx: so you want to find the index of a char in a string?
[05:19:29] <Cork> then ya no array around that
[05:20:27] <ocx> Cork: i am adding tags this way: PushNotification.setTags(["c"], function() {  }  );
[05:20:31] <ocx> so i need to remove the tag
[05:20:54] <ocx> i have a bunch of tags so i need to remove the selected tag for example "c"
[05:21:12] <mdev> guess my question was too trickt for you guys
[05:21:18] <mdev> believe i found the answer anyway
[05:21:58] <Cork> ocx: you need to identify what the data structure you use is
[05:22:02] <Cork> not what functions you call
[05:22:17] <ocx> Cork: http://pastebin.com/1QrD9gKK
[05:22:26] <ocx> adding the tags works fine, removing the tags does not work
[05:22:32] <Cork> mdev: no but you my have to wait for a response sometimes
[05:22:54] <Cork> ocx: i can't tell what object.tags is from that code
[05:23:02] <Cork> *obj.tags
[05:24:05] <ocx> Cork: obj.tags. is an array of tags
[05:24:17] <Cork> an array of "tags"
[05:24:21] <Cork> or an array of strings?
[05:24:27] <ocx> tags
[05:24:33] <Cork> ok what is a tag then?
[05:25:03] <ocx> it is an object returned from the server in obj
[05:25:14] <Cork> then you can't use indexOf
[05:25:19] <ocx> i na callback  PushNotification.getTags(function(obj) {
[05:25:37] <Cork> you would have to use something like .filter(function() {})
[05:25:49] <Cork> and loop over the array finding something unique to check from them
[05:26:38] <ocx> sorry Cork my bad
[05:26:41] <ocx> tag is a string
[05:26:54] <frojnd> Cork: data is not being in table
[05:27:09] <ocx> thats how i add them:   obj.tags = obj.tags.concat([tag])
[05:27:20] <Cork> frojnd: so again, simplify your code
[05:27:23] <frojnd> Cork: also I have this: Uncaught ReferenceError: init is not defined
[05:27:35] <frojnd> 9th line of html
[05:27:41] <Cork> frojnd: start by getting the database code to work
[05:27:51] <Cork> and from there fiddle with the ajax when that is done
[05:28:01] <Cork> don't overcomplicate things by doing it all at once
[05:28:36] <frojnd> as I said. only ading stuff form dom is working http://jsbin.com/yusaj/1/edit
[05:29:05] <Cork> from dom?
[05:29:24] <ocx> got dc...
[05:29:26] <Cork> were are you adding anything from dom?
[05:29:27] <ocx>   obj.tags = obj.tags.concat([tag]) <-- cork
[05:29:50] <frojnd> Cork: sorry adding data from html
[05:29:59] <Cork> but your not
[05:30:12] <frojnd> I know I would like from response
[05:30:25] <Cork> ocx: so you have an array of strings, you should know where to go from there
[05:30:58] <ocx> Cork: yea stuck here:     obj.tags.splice(obj.tags.indexOf("c",1))
[05:31:01] <ocx> this is not doing it
[05:31:44] <Cork> ocx: you most likely want obj.tags.splice(obj.tags.indexOf("c"), 1)
[05:31:53] <Cork> not "c", 1)
[05:32:06] <ocx> what difference does it make?
[05:32:15] <ocx> ah ok!
[05:32:17] <Cork> the first searches for c from the offset of 1
[05:32:22] <Cork> but doesn't remove anything
[05:32:27] <Cork> the second searches for c
[05:32:31] <Cork> and grabs the next 1 elements
[05:32:38] <Grundell> Hello
[05:32:47] <Grundell> I have a little problem that i cant seam to solve
[05:32:53] <And1> Does anyone know of a simple(!) jquery image slider. I just need a function for next/previous images. That's all.
[05:33:09] <Grundell> Thought id ask here what im doing wrong since im pretty novice when it comes to jQuery
[05:34:05] <Trojanq> how to submit form using jQuery
[05:34:45] <Cork> Trojanq: $('form').submit()
[05:34:51] <Trojanq> txh
[05:38:24] <ocx> Cork: obj.tags.splice(obj.tags.indexOf("c"), 1) not working still
[05:38:27] <ocx> the tag is not removed
[05:39:26] <Cork> ocx: then either tags isn't an array
[05:39:32] <Cork> or the content of it isn't strings
[05:39:38] <Cork> cause that should work
[05:39:45] <ocx> can i show you myf full code?
[05:39:56] <Cork> make a jsfiddle
[05:39:58] <ocx> coz in the way it is done in the template, it works
[05:43:01] <ocx> Cork: Line 53..59 is the way i am trying to remove the tag.        Line 118..128 is the way the author of the template is doing and is working for him.    http://jsfiddle.net/9a2Gk/1/
[05:44:33] <ocx> i am lost with the tag and $tag
[05:44:48] <Cork> ocx: if you want my help you need to do the legwork to make it fairly easy to look at it
[05:45:09] <Cork> i can't put in half an hour digging through things trying to find it
[05:45:10] <Cork> sorry
[05:46:09] <SNE> I'm using a mouseover listener to capture when the mouse is over an element with a specific id, if indeed its under that parent (can be few levels) I want to get the parent child which is also a parent of the currently hovered element (can be few levels distance as well)
[05:46:46] <SNE> how can I do that with start to do backwards looping from the hovered element and check each time if the parent of the looped element is the main parent?
[05:47:18] <Cork> SNE: closest does the loop for you
[05:47:24] <Cork> ?api closest
[05:47:25] <b-ot> Cork: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[05:47:43] <ocx> Cork: simplidef as per your request: http://jsfiddle.net/9a2Gk/2/
[05:47:50] <SNE> something like <div id='main_parent'><div class='2n_parent'></div><div class='2n_parent'><hovered element></div></div>
[05:47:50] <ocx> simplified
[05:48:04] <Cork> ocx: but it still isn't running
[05:48:07] <SNE> so I want to get the second 2n_parent
[05:48:16] <ocx> it wont run coz it is a phonegap thing
[05:48:21] <SNE> Cork: I don't c how can I use closest for that
[05:48:30] <Cork> ocx: i either need a dump of an example of what is in obj.tags
[05:48:34] <Cork> ocx: or a running example
[05:48:35] <SNE> I can get the main_parent with it but how can I know the child?
[05:49:01] <Cork> SNE: could you provide the dom structure?
[05:49:11] <Cork> just the structure the content isn't needed
[05:49:20] <Grundell> So i have this problem that my animate() is acting up on me.... don't know why but when i push him down he goes down 320 px but when i push it back up it goes 200px only
[05:49:21] <Grundell> http://dressupinyou.se/
[05:49:36] <SNE> Cork: sure I'll make it now
[05:49:54] <Grundell> is the page, in order to get the animate the window has to be between 480 and 580 px in width
[05:49:59] <ocx> Cork: i read from API: Setters  setTags(Array tags, callback)  Set tags for the device.
[05:50:10] <Grundell> and the action is Få offert.
[05:50:24] <Cork> ocx: that doesn't say what the content of the array is
[05:50:31] <Cork> ocx: and that is the problem we have right now
[05:50:36] <Grundell> Is anyone able to take a look at it for me since im a bit novice when it comes to jQuery
[05:51:15] <Cork> Grundell: i've plowed down more time then i can spare sadly
[05:51:46] <Grundell> Cork: I understand, though i hope its not only you that can lend a helping hand :)
[05:51:47] <ghostlines> Hi, I styled pseudo ::after and ::before elements with with display:none, but can't seem to target it to toggle them via $('classname::after').show(). What may I be doing wrong?
[05:52:58] <seutje> ghostlines: JS access to pseudos is a bit... well, non-existent
[05:53:30] <ocx> Cork: thats a working example: https://github.com/urbanairship/phonegap-ua-push/blob/master/README.md#basic-example
[05:54:04] <seutje> ghostlines: only thing you can do (short of the tedious document.styleSheets iteration) is to have the pseudo be declared like .foo::after { display: none; } .foo.active::after { display: block; } and then just use jQuery to toggle the active class
[05:55:03] <seutje> another thing u can do is have the content be dependent on an attribute, like .foo::after { display: block; content: attr(data-foo); } and then have jQuery set the data-foo attribute to what u want the content to be
[05:55:07] <ghostlines> seutje yeah that's what I'm trying to achieve a toggle
[05:55:38] <SNE> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/YCUr6/ basically I want to get the div with the "_GAb-_GAq-_GAr _GAhf" class when I hover over it or any of its childrens but while using its parent with the id "ID-overview-sparkline" since its the only reliable id there
[05:55:41] <ghostlines> my syntax looks like yours so I'm probably making a typo somewhere
[05:55:44] <seutje> like $('.foo').attr('data-foo', 'LOL CONTENT')
[05:56:08] <Cork> SNE: bind a mouseenter event on it
[05:56:16] <seutje> ghostlines: what syntax? I was mostly giving CSS examples, the pseudo selectors don't work in JS
[05:56:38] <SNE> Cork: mouseenter instead of over? checking now whats the diff..
[05:56:39] <Cork> SNE: $('._GAb-_GAq-_GAr._GAhf').mouseenter().mouseleave()
[05:56:53] <SNE> I don't want to put the select on the class name
[05:56:59] <SNE> that's the main problem
[05:57:04] <SNE> I want to rely on the id
[05:57:07] <SNE> of the parent
[05:57:33] <Cork> ah
[05:58:04] <Cork> SNE: $('#ID-overview-sparkline').on('mouseenter', '> div', function() {})
[05:58:06] <SNE> I can do an upward loop and test each iteration if the parent has the id but it seems really lame
[05:58:10] <Cork> i think something like that should work
[05:58:27] <SNE> now that look a lot better, thx a lot
[05:58:29] <SNE> :)
[05:59:54] <ghostlines> seutje ahh thx I'll look for a work around, thought I could have just done this $('classname::after').show()
[06:00:33] <seutje> ghostlines: nosir, sry
[06:00:38] <SNE> damn mouseenter is nice.... :)
[06:02:56] <ned-> can someone give me a hand  http://96.126.104.64/ned-text.html
[06:03:03] <ned-> right now i cant get the submit to hook in
[06:03:26] <ned-> basically once hte whole form is filled out i want to have an onclick event that's bound to a func
[06:03:39] <ocx> Cork: what is required from my side? i am stuck
[06:04:03] <slax0r> ned-: http://www.latexsens.com/your%20own%20helping%20hand.jpg
[06:04:03] <Cork> ocx: you need to dump what you have in obj.tags
[06:04:16] <Cork> something like console.log(JSON.stringify(obj.tags))
[06:04:30] <slax0r> ned-: don't write java directly in html element
[06:04:37] <slax0r> that's what <script> tag is for, or even ja .js file
[06:05:02] <ocx> Cork: what is the difference between tag and $tag
[06:05:04] <slax0r> and you have an error in your jquery ui css tag
[06:05:06] <slax0r> <linka>
[06:05:37] <Cork> ocx: just guessing but i think $tags is your variable pointing to a dom element
[06:05:45] <slax0r> as for catching events in jquery you wrap code into $(document).ready(function() { /** here comes your code */ });
[06:05:57] <Cork> ocx: and i don't have the live code, so i don't know what your variables are
[06:06:02] <Cork> that is the core of the problem
[06:06:02] <slax0r> and you do: $("selector").click(function() { // your click code });
[06:06:27] <ned-> slax0r: slax0r linka fixed.
[06:06:40] <ned-> slax0r: if you scroll down to the bottom everythings wrapped at in <script> at the bottom
[06:06:44] <ned-> so it catches the click event
[06:07:03] <ocx> Cork: so tag is my local variable $tag is the dom vaiable?
[06:07:24] <slax0r> ned-: oh, see that
[06:07:31] <slax0r> but you have some onclick in yout button
[06:07:48] <slax0r> false written too, you're missing a }
[06:07:59] <ned-> slax0r: aha!
[06:08:11] <dwarder> is there a way to make it dynamic $this.next().next().next()    <- amounts of next()
[06:08:18] <ocx> i have this Cork var $tag = $("<p>" + tag + "</p>")
[06:08:35] <slax0r> dwarder: get number of siblings and do a loop?
[06:08:40] <Cork> ocx: so it most likely has nothing to do with obj.tags
[06:08:47] <ocx> so in javascript $tag is a vairalbr and tag is another variable
[06:09:09] <dwarder> slax0r: could you be more specific please
[06:09:21] <dwarder> slax0r: each() ?
[06:09:47] <slax0r> dwarder: could you be more specific in what you want to achieve?
[06:09:52] <slax0r> the last sibling of $this?
[06:10:49] <ocx> Cork: var $tag = $("<p>" + tag + "</p>") this is so confusing, isnt $tag ==== tag?
[06:10:55] <slax0r> dwarder: to loop through all siblings you'd need to $(this).parent().each()
[06:10:57] <slax0r> I think
[06:11:06] <Cork> ocx: no $tag isn't the same as obj.tags
[06:11:19] <ocx> its not obj.tags here
[06:11:21] <ocx> its tag
[06:11:29] <dwarder> slax0r: is there a way to make it dynamic $this.next().next().next()    <- amounts of next()
[06:12:23] <Cork> ocx: sounds like you need to figure out what your working with then
[06:12:29] <SNE> Cork: it currently capture also inner divs
[06:12:37] <slax0r> dwarder: dynamic to what?
[06:12:52] <slax0r> if there are three elements do three next calls?
[06:13:00] <ocx> i dont know what is tag and what is $tag and first time to know that you can have both
[06:13:15] <dwarder> slax0r: 1 is  $this.next()   2 is $this.next().next()  3 is ....
[06:13:27] <SNE> can I tell it somehow to get the upper parent div inside the div id context?
[06:13:43] <dwarder> slax0r: i pass a number and get that number ammounts of next()
[06:13:54] <slax0r> dwarder: oh...
[06:14:10] <Cork> SNE: you should get that by default
[06:14:28] <Cork> SNE: if you just want the top most parent use mouseover
[06:14:36] <slax0r> function nexts(elem, num) { for (var i = 0; i < num; i++) { elem.next(); } }
[06:14:38] <slax0r> something like that?
[06:14:46] <Cork> SNE: mouseenter checks if you hover the element or any of its children
[06:15:24] <dwarder> slax0r: no ....
[06:15:29] <dwarder> let me think
[06:15:37] <slax0r> then I do not understand what you want :)
[06:15:58] <slax0r> sorry, it should be elem = elem.next(); and after the loop return elem;
[06:17:00] <dwarder> slax0r: let me try your func, maybe it will do the same
[06:17:33] <oal> How come $('...').find() finds my element when I do it directly on the page, but if I copy the page's source and do $('[source code]').find(), it doesn't?
[06:18:11] <Cork> oal: most likely cause what you search for is the outer most element
[06:18:19] <Cork> oal: so you need .filter() instead of .find
[06:18:22] <ned-> slax0r: http://96.126.104.64/usertest.html can you take a look at that
[06:18:27] <ned-> sorry ive been up all night and my mind is mush
[06:18:37] <Cork> oal: .find searches for children of the elements you have in the jquery array
[06:18:45] <Cork> oal: it doesn't check the direct elements
[06:19:10] <ocx> Cork: var tag = $("#addTagField").val() <--- here tag is a string right
[06:19:14] <slax0r> ned-: don't know what's wrong, but to propperly stop the submit, do ev.preventDefault(); in that script at the top of the submit handler
[06:19:25] <oal> Cork, perfect. Thank you, it works now! :D
[06:19:27] <Cork> ocx: yes, but that isn't what you get from setTag
[06:19:35] <slax0r> ned-: and your parentheses are all wrong
[06:19:43] <slax0r> use propper indentation to avoid this
[06:20:03] <ned-> slax0r: fixed parens
[06:20:11] <ned-> sitll not throwing the alert
[06:20:25] <slax0r> ned-: good, now preventDefault as described a bit up?
[06:22:45] <K-202> js> $(['Test']).each(function() { console.log(this); });
[06:22:52] <b-ot> K-202: No output.
[06:23:04] <Cork> the new bot can't do jquery functions
[06:23:09] <Cork> or console.log
[06:23:16] <SNE> Cork: ok with mouseover & mouseleave it works perfectly (with the '> div' selector) so thx a lot again :)
[06:23:33] <K-202> so why does jQuery split strings into characters?
[06:23:54] <Cork> K-202: cause your trying to use a string as a list of dom elements
[06:24:21] <K-202> I want to iterate over a list of strings
[06:24:22] <Cork> K-202: you want $.each(['Test'], function(i, v) { })
[06:24:31] <Cork> or it might be v, i
[06:24:32] <K-202> will $. work in IE 6/7?
[06:24:35] <Cork> i never remeber the order of those
[06:24:37] <Cork> yes
[06:24:41] <K-202> I will try
[06:24:46] <Cork> if you have a jquery version older then 2.x
[06:25:01] <Cork> well not older but with a number lower then 2.x
[06:32:03] <ocx> Cork: https://github.com/quimarche/ping/blob/master/plugins/com.urbanairship.phonegap.PushNotification/Example/index.html line:84
[06:41:08] <ocx> Cork: how cfan u dump tags
[06:42:42] <SNE> Is there some other way to stop another event from triggering other then stopPropagation(), stopImmediatePropagation() & preventDeafult()?
[06:42:50] <CrowX-> I have a jquery .load call that when it loads the desired content, some of that content ends up hidden in the page
[06:43:29] <Cork> CrowX-: most likely cause of css rules
[06:47:07] <frojnd> Cork: sorry to ask you, but are you a freelancer?
[06:47:14] <Cork> frojnd: nope
[06:47:56] <frojnd> ok, nvermind
[06:48:13] <frojnd> Cork: I'm reading indexedDB docs
[06:48:25] <frojnd> since websql support was dropped
[06:48:35] <frojnd> and since I'm only starting to do this it seems logical
[06:48:57] <frojnd> and  after I'll have working indexedDB I'll be able to implement into simple rest
[06:51:07] <CrowX-> Cork,  I have position:fixed. Could that be it?
[06:51:22] <Cork> CrowX-: possible
[06:51:32] <Cork> but most likely visibility, opacity or display
[06:51:52] <Cork> frojnd: indxeddb doesn't work in safari though
[06:52:43] <Cork> frojnd: you might want to check https://github.com/facebook/IndexedDB-polyfill/
[06:56:21] <neogeeo> hello
[06:56:38] <neogeeo> someone have one minute to help me with a little code?
[06:57:26] <Cork> ?ask
[06:57:26] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:57:37] <neogeeo> this code convert the seconds to minutes:seconds (125:35:25)
[06:57:40] <neogeeo> '+((Math.floor(duration / 60)) + ":" + (duration % 60 >= 10 ? "": "0") + (duration % 60))+'
[06:57:53] <SNE> ok I got a tough one (think so anyway :)), I'm writing a Chrome extension which listen to click events on various elements, one of those elements already got a click event on him so when I click it both of the event run. I tried to stop the event but I think that actually the extension event run after the site event... what can be done about that?
[06:57:55] <neogeeo> What I would have to edit to get hours:minutes:seconds (2:35:25) ?
[06:58:49] <Cork> neogeeo: you might want to try using the date object
[06:58:55] <Cork> as it makes those things quite nice
[06:59:38] <SNE> I know that its possible (in some way... maybe only through inner mechanism of the browser?) since I can click on the element with the console inspector and it wont initiate the event
[07:12:47] <Cork> SNE: those are usually made by putting a layer ontop of the page
[07:13:02] <Cork> SNE: so it is quite different from doing it in page
[07:21:22] <Cyclohexane> How would I go about updating the rowsPerPage variable after I've initialised the code? http://pastebin.com/zkK2ZVqC
[07:23:12] <dwarder> how do i make this dynamic ?   $this.add($this.next()).add($this.next().next()).wrapAll("<div class='new' />");
[07:23:21] <dwarder> this .add part
[07:23:28] <dwarder> Cork: this is a tough one
[07:23:55] <dwarder> this .add part
[07:24:24] <MagmaRules> Hello there, im trying to optimize this function: http://pastie.org/8982644 that get called all the time, its consuming 400ms of my loading time. Anyone has any ideas? Im thinking on caching the input elements themselves.
[07:24:46] <Cork> dwarder: what part of that should be dynamic?
[07:24:55] <dwarder> i.e. if i need to wrap 3 elements   $this.add($this.next()).add($this.next().next()).($this.next().next().next()).wrapAll("<div class='new' />");
[07:25:33] <dwarder> i.e. if i need to wrap 4 elements   $this.add($this.next()).add($this.next().next()).add($this.next().next().next().add($this.next().next().next().next())).wrapAll("<div class='new' />");
[07:25:43] <dwarder> Cork: ^
[07:26:03] <Cork> dwarder: $(this).nextAll().addBack().slice(3)
[07:26:10] <Cork> you mean something like that?
[07:26:11] <sungam> Is there a way to trigger an event if I scroll past a specific element?
[07:26:17] <SNE> Cork: so basically the idea is to put the layer and listen to clicks on it and at that event stop the propagation downward?
[07:27:06] <Cork> SNE: what browsers do with the element inspector
[07:27:13] <Cork> is outside the content browser
[07:27:25] <Cork> SNE: all i said is it is a completely different situation
[07:32:26] <dwarder> Cork: thank you, this is what i needed
[07:32:37] <dwarder> Cork: gonna read doc about this func
[07:37:35] <bartek_> If I have an element, and I need to append a fair amount of elements onto it in a loop, there's a better way to do this then call .append() in the loop, right? I just can't recall the faster way to do this. Do I build up an HTML string with jQuery in some manner?
[07:39:20] <NoiseEee> bartek_: you might get more performance out of building a string in parts with an array, joining it and sending it to the container / a single node to append
[07:39:34] <bartek_> NoiseEee: I believe that's what I'm looking for, cool.
[07:40:49] <SNE> Cork: but the inspector actually find the element I click on so how does it do that?
[07:41:50] <Cork> SNE: most likely something similar to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.elementFromPoint
[07:41:58] <Cork> but not fully sure there
[07:42:45] <Cork> SNE: we are talking about the internals of the browser, so they have much more info then what is exposed to the content
[07:45:08] <vol4ko> anyone have had experience with respond.js and what is it?
[07:52:32] <tirengarfio_> is this page really made with masonry? the library is loaded but I can not see any js code refering masonry..
[08:07:47] <SNE> Cork: ok thx again :)  btw I'm trying now to actually duplicate the element which cause the trigger, hide it, and display the duplicate instead so it wont have any event, after the action I will re display it

[08:28:45] <ska-fan_> I'm using PhantomJS to test a JS lib. on 'change' of an input type file an ajax call is made. I'm waiting for it by testing jQuery.active. However, with PhantomJS the test happens so fast that active is still 0. I'm not really interested in ajax so much as in any JS activity. Is there a way to test for that?
[08:29:47] <ska-fan_> I'd hate to have an explicit wait in a test.
[08:34:53] <alxy> hello. I have the folowing html markup: http://pastebin.com/Rvu4SpV3 As you can imagine, those buttons with class=close render little close/delete icons right beside the table headings. I want to remove entire clumns in the table. So how can I find out in which th the button is when clicked? So is it the first or the 5th, or 7th, so I can use nth-child selector to delete the entire column
[08:41:36] <ocx> hi, anything wrong with this?   console.log("TAGTAGTAG"+obj.tags+"");
[08:42:54] <bberry> to programmatically set the value of checked for a radio button, do i use .attr('checked', true); or .prop('checked', true)?
[08:45:33] <Velveeta> bberry: .prop
[08:45:47] <_rgn> how would you prevent a textarea of rows="4" prevent from getting more than 4 rows of input?
[08:45:55] <_rgn> shouldn't scroll at all
[08:46:13] <Velveeta> bberry: certain attributes have a corresponding actual dom element property... those should be set with prop vs attr... things like multiple, required, checked, selected, etc
[08:46:32] <drej> _rgn you can set maxlength on it, for number of characters
[08:46:40] <drej> but thats basically it
[08:46:59] <systemfault> _rgn: number of rows doesn’t make sense… mainly because characters have different widths
[08:47:19] <_rgn> so?
[08:47:26] <Velveeta> yep, the only other way would be to check on keypress to see if the innerheight > height, and chop off the last character, something like that, but that's an even uglier solution
[08:47:46] <systemfault> _rgn: Just think at home many “I” you can put in a textarea with 4 rows compared to one with “M”s
[08:47:49] <Velveeta> _rgn: so what he says is is the truth, number of rows doesn't exactly make sense
[08:48:02] <_rgn> I know the maxlengths would be different
[08:48:08] <_rgn> that's the idea
[08:48:28] <systemfault> Okay.
[08:48:35] <ocx> yeS?
[08:48:36] <ocx> no?
[08:48:39] <systemfault> toaster
[08:49:14] <_rgn> number of rows makes sense to me because i don't want to cut the text off at an arbitrary limit
[08:49:49] <systemfault> _rgn: There’s no built-in way, you’ll have to create something :/
[08:50:08] <Velveeta> number of rows *is* an arbitrary limit
[08:50:24] <Velveeta> especially given that some browsers will let a person drag to resize textareas, natively
[08:50:48] <_rgn> resize: 'none'
[08:50:54] <Velveeta> a non-arbitrary limit would be like "500 chars", based on what size you decide to make a db column that's gonna be storing that data
[08:51:09] <ocx> Cork: obj.tags is returning 57
[09:01:09] <gnarf> 15 too many
[09:03:29] <jKlaus> Hey guys, has anyone ran into issues using Datatables with jQuery 1.11.0?
[09:03:38] <jKlaus> Datatables 1.9.4
[09:03:48] <jKlaus> jQueryUI 1.10.4
[09:04:36] <duch_kazatel> what sorts of issues are you having?
[09:06:55] <ph1> hi all
[09:07:54] <ph1> can someone help me out with some coding.. we have 2 chained dropdown boxes, and the code working for those 2 boxes and want to add a 3rd and need some help with it.
[09:08:04] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ ph1
[09:08:06] <b-ot> ph1: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:09:39] <jKlaus> shit never mind.. I'm stupid
[09:09:47] <jKlaus> didn't have the load order correct
[09:10:01] <duch_kazatel> jKlaus hah - it's always something simple, isn't it?
[09:10:08] <jKlaus> seems to be..
[09:10:18] <jKlaus> good way to start the week lol
[09:10:24] <ph1> this is the ajax request: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1154896757
[09:10:53] <duch_kazatel> ph1 we're more for jquery help, not php.  just fyi.,
[09:11:10] <ph1> and the jquery is in here: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/40191534
[09:13:00] <duch_kazatel> ph1 what's your actual question?
[09:13:02] <uknownalgorithms> I can't figure out why click events are not working on a certain mobile page of my site. The page was working fine before and the console is showing me no errors, physical clicks on elements do nothing but if i use the $(element).click() command it triggers the click functions that i've defined. Any ideas? URL: http://107.21.196.77:8099/submit-video/ (this issue is with the mobile version, so if using chrome please emulate and
[09:13:37] <ph1> duch_kazatel, it's basically just an ajax call to populate 3 dropdowns. and the jquery to update the records showing in each dropdown as the parent dropdown get selected
[09:13:47] <duch_kazatel> uknownalgorithms which event bindings aren't working?  are you binding to things that are ajax'd in?
[09:14:22] <duch_kazatel> ph1 you have to bind to your second dropdown like you've bound to the first.
[09:14:30] <ph1> so the first one is country, select the country, it then limits the provinces based on the country selected, and then limits the cities in the 3rd dropdown based on the province selected
[09:14:44] <duch_kazatel> ph1 right, what part of this are you having difficulty with?
[09:14:59] <duch_kazatel> ph1 because the code is very simple.
[09:15:08] <ph1> the city one
[09:15:11] <ph1> the last dropdown
[09:15:37] <duch_kazatel> ph1 so the code you've shared handles when you select the country - now you want to hook up the bit about selecting a state?
[09:15:40] <ph1> the array is countryCities that it is supposed to get the data from
[09:15:49] <ph1> yeah
[09:15:59] <duch_kazatel> the javascript you supplied is very basic - what about it are you having difficulty with?
[09:16:53] <ph1> well I've tried duplicating the ajax part and changing the variables to countryCities, but it populates the 2nd drop down with those
[09:17:04] <ph1> obviously because i have fixed the jquery part
[09:17:15] <duch_kazatel> ph1 right, you'd have to change $('#countries').change(function() { and $('#provinces').html(response.content); at the very least.
[09:17:15] <ph1> I don't know how to separate the data
[09:18:11] <williamtdr> Hi. Using jQuery Mobile, can I prevent the user from using the back button to get back to a specific page (the login screen)?
[09:18:11] <uknownalgorithms> @duch_kazatel the content is not AJAX and its available on page load. Pretty much all of the elements on the page have a click event, take a look at the submit_video.js file and you can look at the $('.expands').click function for an example http://107.21.196.77:8099/submit-video/# (mobile iphone version of page)
[09:18:21] <ph1> do I add a separate function, and change those to #provinces and #cities respectively type thing?
[09:19:04] <duch_kazatel> ph1 you should abstract out your ajax function and bind to the different dropdowns, calling it as appropriate.  i'll give you a base in a second.
[09:19:45] <ph1> thanks dutch
[09:20:04] <ph1> duch I mean :P
[09:20:51] <duch_kazatel> uknownalgorithms I can click the link just fine, but nothing happens.  is that what you mean?
[09:21:30] <duch_kazatel> uknownalgorithms it might be worthwhile to point out that i see no submit_video.js file.
[09:23:43] <duch_kazatel> ph1 http://jsfiddle.net/RLUv3/2/
[09:23:57] <duch_kazatel> ph1 that isn't guaranteed to work or anything, but that should give you a basic idea.
[09:24:09] <ph1> great ok thanks duch
[09:24:38] <duch_kazatel> of note, line 22 is where you'd do your binding.  i'd reccommend looking into event delegation to add the new dropdowns as necessary.
[09:24:48] <duch_kazatel> *add and bind to the new dropdowns as necessary
[09:24:56] <uknownalgorithms> @duch_kazatel that's correct , nothing happens on click even though the functions should fire. I'm seeing the submit_video.js file for the mobile version of the page under Resources --> Scripts
[09:25:20] <duch_kazatel> uknownalgorithms that file is not included in the source of the page.
[09:26:42] <duch_kazatel> uknownalgorithms also, i'm getting errors like these -> http://i.imgur.com/sSsRbL2.png
[09:27:27] <bberry> Velveeta: gotcha. i recalled reading about that.  On some SO question the answer was .attr, but i thought that was wrong, so i had to ask.  Thanks :D
[09:27:29] <duch_kazatel> and I'm still not seeing the js file you mentioned.
[09:28:13] <Velveeta> bberry: no problem, it can be a little confusing at first until you get used to the standard list of properties that they apply to
[09:30:40] <uknownalgorithms> @duck_kazatel, you have to be logged in to see the  /submit-video/ page. I'm also emulating an iphone 5 device and seeing the <script> tag loading the submit_video.js file on line 684 of the page source. I'm going to clear cache to see if that makes it go missing
[09:31:28] <duch_kazatel> uknownalgorithms at this point, i'm not really sure how to help you.  maybe somebody else will be willing to log in and assist?
[09:45:47] <ph1> duch_kazatel, so just to add to yours would it look like this to cover the 3rd drop down: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1928577116
[09:47:08] <ph1> duch_kazatel, that's a much neater layout and makes much more sense when it's done that way compared to what I first gave you :)
[09:47:30] <duch_kazatel> ph1 it'd be something like that, yeah.  bonus points - cache $(this) and be even cooler, but you get the idea.
[09:48:23] <ph1> how would I use cache $(this)?
[09:48:25] <raskel> when do you write a client ( html5,css3,jquery ) for a back-end app, how do you avoid making an ajax call for each page changed/action, just to check if the user is still logged in? One way is to save the user's auth using localStorage ( html5 ). Any better idea?

[09:50:35] <duch_kazatel> YokoBR okay?  not sure what you want us to do about it >.>
[09:50:58] <YokoBR> duch_kazatel, idk, just commenting.
[09:51:50] <duch_kazatel> jesus christ.  I was trying to figure out why if ($input.prop('checked', true)) { wasn't working right.
[09:51:53] <duch_kazatel> long weekend.
[09:52:50] <kennethd> I have a custom event listener that I am trying to trigger from within an iframe & I just cannot get it to fire.  Both docs are from the same domain.  There is a stripped-down version of the code sans-iframe @ jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/kennethd/2ctYY
[09:53:32] <duch_kazatel> kennethd you're trying to trigger the event inside the iframe from outside the iframe?
[09:54:02] <ph1> duch_kazatel,  how would I use cache $(this) in that example?
[09:54:12] <duch_kazatel> ph1 var $this = $(this);
[09:54:22] <duch_kazatel> then reference $this instead of $(this);
[09:54:24] <kennethd> duch_kazatel: the event listener is registered outside of the iframe, but the .trigger() happens within
[09:54:36] <ph1> coolio
[09:54:36] <duch_kazatel> kennethd https://api.jquery.com/contents/
[09:54:43] <duch_kazatel> this might be appropriate.
[09:55:15] <duch_kazatel> kennethd otherwise, i'm not sure that you can do things that way.  i could be wrong though.
[09:55:53] <kennethd> this is the line that tries to pull the trigger: $('#track_ids', window.parent.document).trigger("externaladd", track_data);
[09:56:10] <Whisphone> I'm getting an error in my JS: TypeError: jQuery(...).onhashchange is not a function
[09:56:22] <Whisphone> https://github.com/whispy/whispy.github.io/blob/master/js/custom.js#L87
[09:56:25] <Whisphone> is the line
[09:56:33] <kennethd> i thought contents() was for drilling down into iframes... i can try it...
[09:56:33] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone easy - that won't work.  you want window.onHashChange = function;
[09:56:48] <duch_kazatel> kennethd i don't think you can do your bidnings that way.
[09:57:18] <kennethd> this does work, fwiw: console.log($('#track_ids', window.parent.document).val());
[09:57:45] <duch_kazatel> kennethd i don't know that you can pass events around like that, but maybe you can.  i've never seen anybody do it that way.
[09:58:49] <Whisphone> duch_kazatel, is this right: https://github.com/whispy/whispy.github.io/blob/master/js/custom.js#L87
[09:58:55] <Whisphone> and the lines followingit
[09:58:59] <Whisphone> *following it
[09:59:07] <raskel> duch_kazatel, i use phonegap to compile my html,css and js code into an .apk package for android. so i don't have any "browser tabs" into my client. i use a back-end app for auth and data manipulation ( mysql ). the problem is that i "walk" through my client app using hyperlinks ( even they are "hidden" ).So i have to find out a way to be able to keep the user status after auth. Now on auth.html i make an ajax call and on succes i do window.location = other
[09:59:07] <raskel> _page.html . But lets say that there my be a second page ( with access restricted ), so if i want to go on secondPageRestricted.html, then i have to check again if the user is still logged in, right? is it better now?
[09:59:10] <kennethd> duch_kazatel: ok, thanks.  i certainly haven't had any luck with it.  i will try to move the trigger outside of the iframe & pull the data out of it with contents()

[10:05:00] <Whisphone> duch_kazatel, got it working
[10:05:06] <duch_kazatel> what was it?
[10:05:07] <Whisphone> Refresh if you want to see how
[10:05:12] <Whisphone> uh
[10:05:24] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[10:05:26] <Whisphone> Changed line 89
[10:05:28] <Whisphone>  function hashChange() {
[10:05:38] <Whisphone> instead of just hashChange({
[10:05:40] <duch_kazatel> yep, i figured.  - I was going to suggest you declare that as a function.
[10:05:43] <Whisphone> :P
[10:05:45] <Whisphone> Thanks!
[10:09:51] <ph1> duch_kazatel, I keep getting this error: ReferenceError: targeturl is not defined
[10:09:52] <ph1> 	
[10:09:52] <ph1> url: targeturl,
[10:10:21] <ph1> I tried but couldn't work out how to fix it
[10:11:05] <duch_kazatel> linky?
[10:13:11] <ph1> oops sorry hangon a sec
[10:13:55] <ph1> duch_kazatel, http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1456196236
[10:14:27] <duch_kazatel> oh, easy.  url: targeturl, -> url: targetUrl,
[10:14:41] <duch_kazatel> small typo
[10:14:51] <ph1> lol I didn't see it
[10:14:53] <ph1> cool :)
[10:14:54] <Whisphone> duch_kazatel, it calls that function even if the hash is not #work
[10:14:59] <Whisphone> Any idea why?
[10:15:13] <duch_kazatel> link again to the code?
[10:15:31] <Whisphone> https://github.com/whispy/whispy.github.io/blob/master/js/custom.js#L90
[10:15:57] <Whisphone> I want it to set var workThumbs = XX and then fancyWork.initthumbs(xx) ONLY if the hash is #work
[10:16:27] <Whisphone> but it seems to be doing it no matter what, as the alert() I have in the fancywork function goes off regardless
[10:16:29] <Whisphone> of the hash
[10:18:06] <duch_kazatel> this is going to sound dumb, but maybe try something like this instead? http://jsfiddle.net/22RBh/
[10:20:10] <Whisphone> duch_kazatel: doesn't fix it :(
[10:20:28] <duch_kazatel> so you put an alert in there and it still fires?
[10:20:42] <Whisphone> Yes
[10:20:46] <Whisphone> The alert fires
[10:21:22] <duch_kazatel> replace the body of that function with just console.log(window.location.hash); and trigger it again.
[10:21:30] <Whisphone> Which function?
[10:21:30] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:21:42] <Whisphone> the hashChange or fancyWork?
[10:21:49] <duch_kazatel> function hashChange() {console.log(window.location.hash)}
[10:21:54] <Whisphone> k
[10:22:37] <Whisphone> Is it supposed to print more info or something?
[10:24:40] <duch_kazatel> back.
[10:24:52] <duch_kazatel> it uses the console instead of alert.
[10:24:55] <Whisphone> Oh okay
[10:25:09] <duch_kazatel> alerts basically stop execution and are awkward to wrangle.
[10:25:47] <Whisphone> It doesn't print anything if I add it outside the if statement of that function
[10:26:41] <Whisphone> Oh, nevermind
[10:26:51] <Whisphone> Okay, it prints the hash, duch_kazatel
[10:26:56] <duch_kazatel> and the hash is what?
[10:27:00] <Whisphone> #work
[10:27:24] <duch_kazatel> okay.  so what happens when you do something that doesn't involve that hash?
[10:28:03] <Whisphone> It doesn't print anything, because I added the console.log in the if === #work statement
[10:28:14] <Whisphone> So it only prints if the hash is #work
[10:28:19] <duch_kazatel> like it should.
[10:28:24] <Whisphone> yup
[10:28:25] <duch_kazatel> so then you should be good to go.
[10:30:02] <Whisphone> duch_kazatel: if I uncomment that rest of that function and leave in the console.log, then the hash doesn't print anymore...
[10:30:26] <Whisphone> wait
[10:30:27] <Whisphone> sorry
[10:30:27] <Whisphone> it doesy
[10:30:32] <Whisphone> *does
[10:31:23] <duch_kazatel> haha, okay.  then this should work -> http://jsfiddle.net/22RBh/2/
[10:31:54] <Whisphone> I think it's calling too quickly
[10:31:59] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:32:13] <Whisphone> Well, I'm fetching /work.html when I click the Work link
[10:32:19] <Whisphone> but the hash changes to #work immediately
[10:32:23] <Whisphone> before the /work.html content loads
[10:32:37] <duch_kazatel> let's back up - what are you trying to do?
[10:32:45] <Whisphone> okay
[10:32:47] <duch_kazatel> because the hash will change before the ajax finishes.
[10:32:51] <Whisphone> Yeah
[10:33:22] <Whisphone> Is there a way to delay setting the variable workThumbs in the hashChange function until the ajax finishes?
[10:33:39] <duch_kazatel> don't do that - instead, use the success callback of the ajax function.
[10:33:42] <duch_kazatel> or .done()
[10:34:17] <Whisphone> duch_kazatel, in the hashchange function?
[10:34:36] <Whisphone> or in the function that fetches /work.html?
[10:34:52] <duch_kazatel> wherever you're running $.ajax()
[10:34:59] <Whisphone> hm
[10:35:18] <Whisphone> so then I'd have to nest the hashChange function
[10:35:20] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ -> look at the stuff referencing .done();
[10:35:24] <Whisphone> inside that ajax function
[10:35:27] <duch_kazatel> err, no, you wouldn't do that.
[10:35:32] <duch_kazatel> what are you using the hashchange for?
[10:36:18] <duch_kazatel> you should use the returned data or a clicked link to tell you what you need to do, instead of the hashchange event (in this case).
[10:36:42] <Whisphone> I want to define the workThumbs variable and then init the fancyWork function ONLY when the hash is #work (this part works) but to have it do so ONLY when the ajax function is done
[10:36:58] <gnarf> Whisphone: you should stop trying to think "synchronusly" --- tell yourself a story, "when this happens, this happens" - also, when dealing with async data
[10:37:11] <gnarf> you can just store the ajax promise
[10:37:16] <gnarf> and then life makes a lot more sense
[10:37:38] <gnarf> var workThumbs = $.get(....);
[10:37:42] <gnarf> then later when you need to use it
[10:37:52] <gnarf> workThumbs.done(function(data) {})
[10:37:57] <Whisphone> hm
[10:38:03] <Whisphone> lemme look into this
[10:38:06] <gnarf> it will only request once
[10:38:33] <duch_kazatel> gnarf has it - you're relying on an event that'll complete before the ajax is done.  you need to flip around the concept and instead rely on the completion of the ajax and base everything off that event, instead/
[10:38:55] <Whisphone> I'm not actually using .ajax() though
[10:38:58] <gnarf> you aren't writing a php script, something that "runs" until its done, you're writing an "event driven" system
[10:38:58] <Whisphone> I'm using .load()
[10:39:05] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone that calls $.ajax()
[10:39:09] <Whisphone> oh ok
[10:39:11] <gnarf> Whisphone: .load is simple using .ajax()
[10:39:13] <gnarf> basically
[10:39:21] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone so you can effectively treat it the same way :)
[10:39:38] <gnarf> $.get(url).done(function(content) { $("#selector").html(content); setupNewEvents(); });
[10:40:40] <Whisphone> What's the difference between .get() and .load()?
[10:40:55] <jKlaus> anyone in here use angular much?
[10:40:56] <Whisphone> oh
[10:40:59] <Whisphone> Nevermind, I see
[10:41:33] <gnarf> Whisphone: .load() is a shortcut --- https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/load.js#L18
[10:41:34] <jKlaus> I'm trying to figure out the best way to consume a WCF web service from angular, displaying the return in a datatable
[10:41:44] <Whisphone> Yeah, I see
[10:46:17] <jtri> hello, i'm getting a Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined , and ringing my head about it b/c $ is defined on the page after it loads, but $(document).ready(function() {}) fails
[10:46:40] <jtri> when i stop to think about it this is a chicken/egg problem, but i am loading the library in a script tag above...
[10:46:43] <duch_kazatel> jtri have a fiddle to demonstrate?
[10:47:04] <jtri> let me see, i can at least do a dpaste
[10:47:49] <jtri> here's the dpaste, to the point of the error: http://dpaste.com/1766363/
[10:48:17] <duch_kazatel> and the html is valid?
[10:48:50] <jtri> think so, just adding the ready causes the error
[10:48:59] <duch_kazatel> try using this instead; jQuery(document).ready(function($){
[10:49:19] <jtri> I cut the dpaste, but yeah, the script tag closes etc
[10:51:15] <duch_kazatel> what happens when you try what i pasted above?
[10:51:23] <Voyage_> hi
[10:51:29] <Voyage_> is this correct $('#box-creation-form').children('form').reset; ?
[10:51:43] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ what is .reset?
[10:51:45] <duch_kazatel> a property?
[10:51:59] <Voyage_> ya, thats the question. I want to reset the fields
[10:52:00] <jtri> hang on, i see an error with loading jquery, yet $ is there in the console after it loads...
[10:52:32] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  how do I do that?
[10:52:34] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ all of them?  you'll have to manually run through them an do .val('') on each i'm guessing.
[10:53:13] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  how about $('#box-creation-form').children().val('')?
[10:53:28] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6364347/923919
[10:53:32] <duch_kazatel> it'll be something like this.
[10:53:32] <naomi> i have a list of paragraph tags: var p = $("p"); I want the first one, p[0] but i wanted it wrapped as jquery. Is it easiest to do $(p[0]), or is there a better way ?
[10:53:48] <bengalo> $('p').first()
[10:53:50] <duch_kazatel> naomi p.get(0)
[10:54:06] <frank_o> Hi, so far I've been using iScroll with iScrollView to provide scrolling inside jQuery Mobile's panel widget: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/8CVac/
[10:54:09] <frank_o> But how come I can't achieve the same thing using `overflow: auto`? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/4Q8yb/ (https://github.com/filamentgroup/Overthrow)
[10:54:10] <Whisphone> https://github.com/whispy/whispy.github.io/blob/master/js/custom.js#L94 I get an error on this
[10:54:13] <duch_kazatel> naomi and prepend that p with a dollar sign so you know it's a jquery object - $p = $(p);
[10:54:14] <Whisphone> and I think I'm not closing it off right somehow
[10:54:17] <Whisphone> but can't figure it out
[10:54:34] <naomi> bengalo: sorry, i should be more specific that I actually want the nth index.
[10:54:57] <naomi> duch_kazatel: i will get .get(n)
[10:55:02] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:55:10] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,   $('#box-creation-form').find("input[type=text], textarea").val(""); ?
[10:55:33] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ it'll be something like that.  you'll also need to handle checkboxes/dropdowns/password fields.
[10:55:33] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[10:55:40] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone what's the error?
[10:55:49] <naomi> duch_kazatel: the problem with $p.get(0) is that it returns the raw HTML element
[10:55:49] <Whisphone> SyntaxError: missing : after property id
[10:55:50] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  yes. so this is ok?  $('#box-creation-form').find("input[type=text], textarea").val("");
[10:56:04] <Whisphone> but that doesn't mean it's missing a :
[10:56:08] <Whisphone> I've had that error before
[10:56:16] <naomi> duch_kazatel: i want the equivalent of $("p:eq(" + n + ")");
[10:56:21] <Whisphone> and it was because I was missing a ), }, or ;
[10:56:50] <bengalo> you have )}
[10:56:53] <bengalo> and you want })
[10:57:06] <bengalo> l95
[10:57:11] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone http://jsfiddle.net/edV43/
[10:57:27] <duch_kazatel> you also had  $.get("work.html").done(function({ - you wanted  $.get("work.html").done(function(} {
[10:57:39] <duch_kazatel> Nach0z that.s what .get() does
[10:57:41] <duch_kazatel> err, naomi
[10:58:28] <naomi> duch_kazatel: well i don't want the raw html element
[10:58:40] <duch_kazatel> then use .eq() ?
[10:58:43] <naomi> i want a jquery wrapped element at the nth index of p
[10:58:43] <duch_kazatel> or what you all ready have?
[10:58:43] <naomi> oh
[10:58:49] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[10:58:50] <naomi> i'm not aware of .eq ...
[10:58:50] <naomi> ;p;
[10:58:52] <naomi> lol*
[10:58:55] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[10:59:05] <naomi> well thank you :)
[10:59:21] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[11:01:30] <Whisphone> duch_kazatel, it's still calling the fancyWork function too early
[11:01:43] <Whisphone> hm
[11:02:37] <duch_kazatel> I haven't dumped through that function, but it sounds like you're doing something very strange, especially since now you're putting all your code within the hashchange callback.
[11:02:45] <Whisphone> hm
[11:02:51] <Whisphone> i dunno
[11:03:11] <Whisphone> I think I may not have done the .get completely correct
[11:04:07] <duch_kazatel> that initThumbs() method is wrapping your string in a selector, right?
[11:04:42] <Whisphone> I think so
[11:05:51] <Whisphone> duch_kazatel, the .get() is not selecting the right selector in the work.html page
[11:05:51] <duch_kazatel> that's an odd way to do things.
[11:06:03] <duch_kazatel> what isn't?
[11:06:09] <Whisphone> the .get()
[11:06:32] <duch_kazatel> "is not selecting the right selector in the work.html page" - that doesn't make much sense.  you mean  workThumbs = '#workThumbBG div img'; isn't working the way you'd expect?
[11:06:38] <Whisphone> Yes
[11:06:39] <duch_kazatel> because that's just seeing workThumbs to a string.
[11:06:43] <duch_kazatel> *setting
[11:06:59] <Whisphone> sec i'll take a screenshot to show you
[11:07:33] <duch_kazatel> i'm looking at your code now - you've got some strange scoping going on.
[11:07:49] <Whisphone> duch_kazatel: http://i.imgur.com/eaQvYr2.png
[11:08:02] <duch_kazatel> right, that's a string.
[11:08:05] <duch_kazatel> that's not selecting anything.
[11:09:40] <Whisphone_> duch_kazatel, shouldn't it list the img elements there though?
[11:09:42] <Whisphone_> if it were working
[11:10:03] <duch_kazatel> huh?  again, you're setting workThumbs to a string.
[11:10:10] <Whisphone_> yes
[11:10:15] <Whisphone_> but that string doesn't exist yet
[11:10:20] <duch_kazatel> yes it does.
[11:10:33] <duch_kazatel> the string is a string.  that's not a selector.
[11:10:41] <duch_kazatel> your issue will be in fancyWork
[11:10:55] <bberry> lets say i have a group of radio buttons with name="foo".  Whats the best selector to use to get the checked one?
[11:10:59] <Whisphone_> the arguments have the entire work.htlm page in it though
[11:11:08] <Whisphone_> Shouldn't it only have the string?
[11:11:09] <drej> bberry :checked
[11:11:34] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone huh?  you're not doing anything with the returned data.
[11:11:57] <bberry> like $('input[name="foo"]:checked')?
[11:12:01] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone $.get() fetches stuff for you.  you need to do something with it after the fact.
[11:12:07] <Whisphone_> duch_kazatel, exactly
[11:12:15] <bberry> drej ^
[11:12:26] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone_ but the string exists - that's not a selector.
[11:12:29] <Whisphone_> I want it to see "okay, there's the #workThumbs div img elements"
[11:12:42] <duch_kazatel> then pop your data into your page and go from there.
[11:12:43] <Whisphone_> and then define workThumbs as those elements
[11:13:03] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone_ you're all ready trying to do that inside of fancyWork.initThumbs();
[11:13:09] <duch_kazatel> you're tripping yourself up.
[11:13:53] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/edV43/1/
[11:14:17] <Whisphone_> hm
[11:14:32] <duch_kazatel> you need to do something with the returned data.  given the way your code is currently structured, workThumbs should remain a string.
[11:17:35] <Whisphone_> duch_kazatel, it's getting the data of the entire work.html page and appending it
[11:17:44] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone_ in my example, yes.
[11:17:52] <duch_kazatel> where were you doing that before?
[11:17:56] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: Whisphone_: going a little further with the "async programming model" - stop doing "callback waterfalls" --- http://jsfiddle.net/edV43/2/
[11:18:05] <duch_kazatel> that, doo.
[11:18:07] <Whisphone_> I don't want the entire work.html though
[11:18:13] <Whisphone_> I just want #workThumbs div img
[11:18:22] <gnarf> Whisphone_: see my fiddle, i did that too
[11:18:33] <gnarf> i supected you might be using .load(url, selector)  ;)
[11:18:35] <duch_kazatel> aaaah, yeah check out gnarf's example.
[11:18:48] <Whisphone_> so it's better to split it up into more functions?
[11:18:54] <Whisphone_> instead of having fewer?
[11:18:59] <duch_kazatel> it's better to abstract.
[11:19:01] <Whisphone_> (in general, I mean)
[11:19:15] <gnarf> also sorry - Whisphone_: i missed the () on the parens on line 18: http://jsfiddle.net/edV43/3/
[11:19:22] <Whisphone_> Not sure how you're using 'abstract', duch_kazatel
[11:19:34] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone_ look at gnarf's example :)
[11:19:49] <duch_kazatel> they're splitting up different "tasks" into functions and calling them.
[11:20:05] <gnarf> Whisphone_: everytime you declare a function inside of another function, it gets the scope of the parent function
[11:20:14] <gnarf> when you can avoid declaring a function inside of a function, do so
[11:20:18] <duch_kazatel> Whisphone_ the way your code is currently structured is very confusing, even to you.  your fancyWork object alone is overly complex.  you're wrapping the entire thing inside of an IIFE for some reason.
[11:20:28] <Whisphone_> I was told to do that :P
[11:20:47] <gnarf> wrapping code in an iife is a good way to "hide" all these "global functions"
[11:21:05] <duch_kazatel> the contents of the function shouldn't be.  maybe an IIFE around a group of functions, but i'd never do it inside of one.
[11:21:14] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise you're creating a scope in a scope.
[11:21:26] <Whisphone_> What part is the IIFE?
[11:21:34] <gnarf> `iife
[11:21:34] <b-ot> gnarf: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[11:21:37] <gnarf> ^
[11:21:44] <duch_kazatel> var fancyWork = (function() {})
[11:21:46] <gnarf> (function() { }())
[11:21:50] <Whisphone_> oh
[11:21:58] <Whisphone_> that's the link in the comment too
[11:22:02] <duch_kazatel> you're calling it a "immediately invoked anonymous function expression "
[11:22:07] <Whisphone_> My friend wrapped it in the IIFE
[11:22:10] <Whisphone_> he said it was "better"
[11:22:13] <duch_kazatel> doing that inside of a function doesn't make sense.
[11:22:25] <gnarf> where is this code?
[11:22:30] <duch_kazatel> the function all ready creates a scope, so it's redundant.
[11:22:41] <Whisphone_> gnarf, my code?
[11:22:47] <gnarf> yeah
[11:22:53] <gnarf> with that iife
[11:22:58] <Whisphone_> https://github.com/whispy/whispy.github.io/blob/master/js/custom.js
[11:23:03] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/whispy/whispy.github.io/blob/master/js/custom.js#l46
[11:23:31] <duch_kazatel> i kind of see why they might do it that way, but it doesn't make much sense to me.
[11:23:35] <gnarf> yeah, thats a bit of an anti-pattern
[11:23:50] <gnarf> also, for the love of god - use something that forces you to tab correctly ;)
[11:24:11] <gnarf> it serves a purpose there
[11:24:16] <gnarf> its called the "exposing module pattern"
[11:25:21] <gnarf> but like this is something you do when you are including a bunch of files, and trying to "hide" your internal implementations from the "external" code
[11:25:31] <Whisphone_> hm
[11:25:42] <gnarf> if this is just a personal project, bag of "semi-global" methods is a perfectly fine design pattern
[11:25:50] <gnarf> also
[11:26:02] <gnarf> do you realize you are calling jQuery(this) about 3 times in a row here: https://github.com/whispy/whispy.github.io/blob/master/js/custom.js#L53-L54
[11:26:07] <gnarf> function calls aren't free ;)
[11:26:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you're adding a level of unnecessary complexity to the entire project.
[11:26:19] <gnarf> var $this = $(this); is pretty useful
[11:26:27] <gnarf> chaching selections in general is pretty useful
[11:26:43] <duch_kazatel> definitely.
[11:26:44] <Whisphone_> I got line 54 from a tutorial
[11:26:54] <Whisphone_> on how to do the .load() stuff
[11:26:57] <gnarf> that tutorial is dumb :)
[11:26:59] <Whisphone_> :P
[11:27:00] <duch_kazatel> don't copy/paste from tutorials unless you know what they're doing :)
[11:27:04] <duch_kazatel> if you don't, learn it.
[11:27:10] <gnarf> you should ALWAYS cache selections
[11:27:28] <gnarf> every time you do jQuery( "something" ) - it asks the DOM
[11:27:30] <duch_kazatel> DOM operations are expensive.
[11:27:34] <gnarf> jQuery( this )is pretty cheap
[11:27:36] <gnarf> but still
[11:27:53] <Voyage_> I just created a dom element by jquery,     for that element, a .click function is not called. (the function is only called for similar elements which were created on page load rather by DOM creation by some eventss). What can be the reason?
[11:27:57] <gnarf> why call jQuery 4 times to get 4 different jQuery objects you just have to throw away later
[11:28:03] <Whisphone_> yeah
[11:28:04] <Whisphone_> makes sense
[11:28:19] <Whisphone_> gnarf, in your code, you wrote $("placetoputwork")
[11:28:31] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ is the node attached after you try to attach the listener?
[11:28:32] <gnarf> like wherever you want to inject it in the page
[11:28:39] <gnarf> the selector
[11:28:41] <duch_kazatel> if so, check out event delegation.
[11:28:44] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  attached?
[11:29:08] <Whisphone_> gnarf, I also do this in the fancyDan function though
[11:29:09] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  I see that node in the dom
[11:29:12] <Whisphone_> with .load()
[11:29:18] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ fiddle it please.
[11:29:27] <Voyage_> very tough
[11:29:41] <Voyage_> its so embeded
[11:29:50] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ okay - when you run your .click() binding, is that done before you create the node?
[11:30:15] <gnarf> Whisphone_: just showing you some different patterns for dealing with async loading
[11:30:21] <gnarf> its not a very intuitive thing
[11:30:41] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,   the .click() is before
[11:30:42] <gnarf> I personally never use jQuery.fn.load
[11:30:51] <gnarf> I always ajax and inject
[11:31:02] <gnarf> finer control over what happens with the data
[11:31:05] <gnarf> caching
[11:31:08] <gnarf> all that jazz
[11:31:20] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  but I also used a $doc.on(click, class here , function.) and put it in $doc.ready    . still no use.
[11:31:20] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ the click can't bind to things that don't exist on pageload.  use event delegation instead.  i would look at the docs for .on()
[11:31:41] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ fiddle the relevant javascript then, because that means you're doing something wrong.
[11:31:54] <gnarf> `p

[11:33:05] <gnarf> `paste
[11:33:05] <b-ot> gnarf: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:33:07] <gnarf> ahhh
[11:33:10] <gnarf> yay
[11:33:13] <ravenzz> :D
[11:33:14] <gnarf> lol
[11:33:16] <duch_kazatel> good ol' ecmabot
[11:33:42] <gnarf> `js lol
[11:33:45] <gnarf> `eval lol
[11:33:49] <duch_kazatel> >>
[11:33:50] <gnarf> js> lol
[11:33:56] <b-ot> gnarf: No output.
[11:34:01] <gnarf> never defined that one i guess
[11:35:12] <Whisphone_> gnarf, if I want to put everything from the .content div inside .X div
[11:35:24] <Whisphone_> but do NOT want to include the .content div itself
[11:35:36] <Whisphone_> would it be like
[11:35:40] <gnarf> Whisphone_: in my fiddle, line 5 is the find, add .children()
[11:35:46] <gnarf> so you get all the elements
[11:35:47] <Whisphone_> Ah
[11:35:49] <Whisphone_> okay
[11:35:58] <gnarf> if there are raw text nodes there
[11:36:35] <gnarf> you might need http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[11:36:38] <gnarf> instead of children
[11:37:44] <Whisphone_> gnarf: find("#workThumbBG .content").contents()
[11:37:47] <Whisphone_> like that?
[11:37:58] <gnarf> yeah
[11:38:13] <Whisphone_> doesn't work
[11:38:17] <gnarf> then just pass "work" into your "reinitalize"
[11:38:25] <gnarf> console log it? make sure you have what you expect?
[11:38:57] <naomi> i have div with max-height: 200px; overflow-y: scroll; How can i get the total height of the div? div.height() only returns 200
[11:39:35] <gnarf> naomi: .prop("scrollHeight")
[11:39:53] <naomi> gnarf: ok i will try that, thank you
[11:40:01] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  its very difficult. let me see what I can do on my own. thanks.  I understand that you need to look at the code
[11:40:21] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ you need to bind to things that exist on pageload and ensure that your selectors are all correct.
[11:40:37] <Whisphone_> gnarf, it just does it twice
[11:40:44] <Whisphone_> because I have the .load() in the other function
[11:40:45] <Whisphone_> lol
[11:41:26] <gnarf> get rid of the load
[11:41:40] <Whisphone_> that breaks that function though
[11:41:45] <Whisphone_> and will break every other link
[11:42:54] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  I also used a $doc.on(click, class here , function.) and put it in $doc.ready    .  should that do?
[11:43:16] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ I'd need to see the actual binding, because that's obviously not valid.
[11:44:01] <naomi> gnarf: thank you, that is great
[11:44:24] <Voyage_> that's obviously not valid. ? well the syntax I wrote is pseudo code type of thing. but the idea is ok?
[11:44:41] <Whisphone_> gnarf, I removed the .load() stuff from it
[11:44:47] <Whisphone_> and left just your code
[11:45:23] <Whisphone_> but now it doesn't get the work.html page and append it
[11:45:29] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ if it's basically $(document).on('ready', function() { $(document).on('click', '.childClass', function() { /* your handler here */ } });
[11:45:37] <Whisphone_> oh the hash doesn't change
[11:45:52] <duch_kazatel> wait that should be $(document).on('ready', function() {$(document).on('click', '.childClass', function() { /* your handler here */ })});
[11:46:57] <Voyage_> ya. thanks
[11:49:10] <duch_kazatel> brb lunch
[11:51:01] <gnarf> Whisphone_: glad you're figuring it out, i gotta run, hope you understood some of those lessons, i promise you its gonna make your life easier :)
[11:51:09] <Whisphone_> Thanks!
[11:51:16] <Whisphone_> Hope I understood them too... :P
[12:01:00] <Whisphone_> How would I format this if I wanted to load the children of .content? jQuery(this).attr('href') + ' .content ' + .children();
[12:03:41] <ravenzz> $($(this.attr('href') + ' .content')).children()
[12:03:52] <Whisphone_> thanks. ravenzz
[12:03:53] <ravenzz> $($(this).attr('href') + ' .content')).children()
[12:04:40] <ravenzz> forgot a parenthesis
[12:04:55] <Whisphone_> yup, noticed
[12:04:55] <Whisphone_> thanks

[12:35:32] <midwestward> Hey, what the the best way to store html content that is to be inserted into a page? In the JS code? In a hidden HTMl element?
[12:37:42] <systemfault> Hidden HTML or in a script tag with some bogus type(<script type=“x-template”>HTML HERE</script> in the simplest cases. Compiled to JS or in separated files for more complex scenarios
[12:42:18] <MACscr> is there any way to track the referrer no matter if the target or source is https or http?
[12:43:00] <midwestward> thanks systemfault
[12:55:05] <frojnd> Hi there. Normally when you crate <div id="somedivid">bla</div> and then call this in .js like var variable=document.getElementById("somedivid").innerHTML you get "bla" as output. In my case I get: cannot read properety 'innerHTML' of null like the value is empty... http://jsbin.com/becuy/1/edit any ideas why it wont read the content of div?
[12:57:35] <asturel> var name = $("#output").html();
[12:57:54] <duch_kazatel> frojnd where are you getting that error in the bin?
[12:58:21] <frojnd> also in local browser
[12:58:24] <frojnd> duch_kazatel:
[12:58:37] <duch_kazatel> what line?  i'm not seeing any errors.
[12:59:39] <asturel> maybe because i edited it ?:$
[12:59:40] <asturel> :DD
[12:59:57] <duch_kazatel> asturel huh?
[13:00:05] <asturel> ?
[13:00:20] <asturel> it was
[13:00:21] <asturel> var name = document.querySelector("#output").value;
[13:00:25] <asturel> then name.innerHTML
[13:00:35] <asturel> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'innerHTML' of null
[13:00:47] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: var name = document.getElementById("#output");
[13:00:52] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: I found out
[13:00:58] <frojnd> I forgot to ommit '#'
[13:01:15] <asturel> isnt mine simplier?:P
[13:01:20] <asturel> (21:57:27) (asturel) var name = $("#output").html();
[13:01:24] <duch_kazatel> asturel your edits would happen in a different copy - jsbin updates automatically and spits out a new URL.
[13:01:30] <asturel> oh..
[13:01:42] <asturel> just because i opened it in an incognito tab and i saw what i edited
[13:01:55] <duch_kazatel> right - you had the new URL probably.
[13:02:11] <asturel> i copied it: http://jsbin.com/nukevadi/1/edit
[13:02:16] <asturel> ah..:D
[13:02:24] <asturel> i thought its an username, sorry .DD
[13:07:33] <jdo_dk> The doc says: The POST method is used if data is provided as an object; otherwise, GET is assumed. - https://api.jquery.com/load/
[13:07:47] <jdo_dk> What if i would "force" the method to be GET ?
[13:08:03] <duch_kazatel> use $.ajax() instead.
[13:08:06] <jdo_dk> DO i then need to use $.ajax
[13:08:08] <jdo_dk> :D

[13:29:13] <Horacsio> I want to check if browser is safari all font-weight: 300;
[13:29:31] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio don't browser detect.
[13:29:37] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio why do you think you need to do that?
[13:29:55] <Horacsio> because a google font don't work correctly under safari
[13:30:10] <Horacsio> why don't browser detect?
[13:30:12] <duch_kazatel> you'll want to do that server-side, then.
[13:30:19] <Horacsio> how come?
[13:30:41] <Horacsio> how do I do that server-side? :(
[13:30:54] <duch_kazatel> check the user agent there and decide which font file to include.
[13:30:55] <__joshua__> user agent fields in headers?
[13:30:59] <duch_kazatel> or use a different font.
[13:31:08] <checkit> Hey guys... So I have an ol li each with a data-id attribute. How can get get all li data-id attributes into a jquery object?
[13:31:33] <ph88_> hey we are passing back a full html snipper over ajax, and then we want to add an event handler to one of the elements, is it best to put it in a jquery object  or just send the id of the selector along with the response ?
[13:31:33] <Horacsio> please a link to check user agent?
[13:31:39] <duch_kazatel> checkit that... doesn't make sense.
[13:31:48] <__joshua__> $('li').map(function(){ return $(this).attr('data-id'); });
[13:32:06] <duch_kazatel> ph88_ use event delegation.
[13:32:17] <duch_kazatel> ph88_ bind to a parent element and listen for events as they bubble up.
[13:32:19] <ph88_> duch_kazatel: good point xD
[13:32:36] <ph88_> duch_kazatel: but doesn't it matter that all the other elements get rebound too ?
[13:32:46] <duch_kazatel> ph88_ huh?
[13:32:55] <duch_kazatel> ph88_ bind to a parent element that exists and never gets remove.d
[13:32:58] <frojnd> I have a sort of .. em general question. I managed to get data with rest request with one button I get data that is filled into div. I also created a button to get this data from div and store it into indexedDB. Now I have created third button. I don't know how to get data from rest service show it on screen and directly store it to indexedDB. Any ideas? http://jsbin.com/jufaq/1/edit
[13:32:59] <ph88_> duch_kazatel: there was already event handlers on elements with the same selector
[13:33:18] <ph88_> duch_kazatel: ah ok i got it
[13:33:20] <duch_kazatel> ph88_ you can bind multiple events if you want.
[13:33:23] <Horacsio> member:duch_kazatel how to check the user agent server-side?
[13:33:44] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio depends on your backend.
[13:33:49] <duch_kazatel> do a search in google for it.
[13:33:53] <Horacsio> wordpress
[13:34:01] <duch_kazatel> you mean PHP?
[13:34:32] <blackf0rk> $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
[13:34:37] <duch_kazatel> that should do it.
[13:35:07] <checkit> Hey duch_kazatel: Here's an approximation of what I'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/FZRk2/
[13:35:41] <Horacsio> oh ok. so I can check the user agent, if it's safari can I point to another .css?
[13:35:58] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio sure, but you should probably not use that font if it has problems in safari.
[13:36:22] <Horacsio> why not?
[13:36:27] <duch_kazatel> checkit somebody posted an answer for you, but the idea of "all li data-id attributes into a jquery object" doesn't make much sense.
[13:36:44] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio because it's a hack.
[13:37:15] <Horacsio> could you be more clear?
[13:37:52] <duch_kazatel> http://css-tricks.com/browser-detection-is-bad/
[13:37:57] <duch_kazatel> start there.  go down the rabbit hole :)
[13:38:45] <blackf0rk> @Horacsio what exactly are you trying to serve up, and why?
[13:38:55] <duch_kazatel> it's a font file that breaks in one browser, blackf0rk
[13:39:18] <duch_kazatel> also, if you prepend username with an @ symbol, most clients won't properly notify them that they've been mentioned.
[13:39:27] <Horacsio> it's a google font!
[13:39:39] <blackf0rk> and this Google font isn't working on what device?
[13:39:41] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue with it in safari?
[13:39:48] <blackf0rk> duch_kazatel: thanks
[13:41:29] <checkit> Oh great __joshua__. Ty. duch_kazatel Array is what I'm looking for. All of the data-id's need to be serialized and posted.
[13:41:30] <Horacsio> yes that google font weight is not working properly
[13:41:50] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio which font?
[13:42:02] <Horacsio> Exo 2
[13:42:59] <blackf0rk> are you trying to apply a bold style to the font or wrap text with that font in a <b>?
[13:43:08] <Horacsio> weight 200
[13:43:12] <duch_kazatel> he's trying to increase the weight in just safari.
[13:43:46] <blackf0rk> don't increase weight of those fonts. instead, use the 200, 300, 400 etc faces
[13:43:51] <blackf0rk> use a different class
[13:44:09] <blackf0rk> https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Exo+2
[13:44:13] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio is it too bold, or not bold enough?
[13:44:19] <ph88_> duch_kazatel:   we have this now    $('#categories a.add-task').on('click', function(e) {     a.add-task is being added and #categories stays .. but it's not working with even delegation
[13:44:30] <duch_kazatel> ph88_ that is not event delegation.
[13:44:44] <ph88_> how are we suppose to do it ?
[13:44:53] <duch_kazatel> $('#categories').on('click', '.add-task', function(e) { });
[13:45:00] <ph88_> thank you
[13:45:08] <duch_kazatel> see the second argument to .on()?
[13:45:17] <ph88_> yes i remember now
[13:45:19] <Horacsio> What I found odd is that the font, at Google font site renders ok!
[13:45:23] <ph88_> i hardly use it and should be using it WAY MORE OFTEN
[13:45:26] <ph88_> :D
[13:46:22] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio are you using safari on a Mac, or on a Windows box?
[13:46:56] <Horacsio> mac
[13:47:50] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio try -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
[13:47:54] <duch_kazatel> see if that helps anything.
[13:48:26] <blackf0rk> if you're trying to apply a font-weight that is larger or smaller than what the font was built for, you're gonna have a bad time.
[13:48:40] <frojnd> Any ideas for my problem?
[13:48:41] <blackf0rk> that is why google fonts come with different font-weight options
[13:49:13] <duch_kazatel> frojnd sorry, must have missed it.  what was it again?
[13:49:32] <frojnd> I have a sort of .. em general question. I managed to get data with rest request with one button I get data that is filled into div. I also created a button to get this data from div and store it into indexedDB. Now I have created third button. I don't know how to get data from rest service show it on screen and directly store it to indexedDB. Any ideas? http://jsbin.com/jufaq/1/edit
[13:49:54] <frojnd> rest is done with ajax, filling into indexedDB with dom
[13:50:47] <blackf0rk> Horacsio: So, for example, if you're using Exo 2 Thin 100 and set a font-weight of 200 on it, the extra weight is left up to the browser to render (some browsers don't handle it correctly). So if you want to have a font-weight of 200, you'll have to use a different face, like Extra-Light 200, or Normal 400 etc.
[13:50:52] <duch_kazatel> so you're trying to have the third button basically combine the effect of buttons 1 and 2o, frojnd?
[13:51:27] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: yes
[13:51:30] <frojnd> I can replace it
[13:51:33] <frojnd> though
[13:51:42] <duch_kazatel> okay - what part of this are you not understanding?  it's pretty basic.
[13:52:12] <frojnd> To mee it's not :) I've been reading ajax, dom, jquery and stuff for the last few days and everything is not so clear :D haha
[13:52:24] <duch_kazatel> right, so which part are you getting stuck on?
[13:53:03] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: I just thought I add "myButton" in querySelector
[13:53:11] <frojnd> in EventListener
[13:53:32] <frojnd> but then this event listeners happens before ajax so into db gets only "" (empty string"
[13:53:58] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:54:55] <duch_kazatel> okay - let's back up and explain some basics.  first off, you should abstract out your ajax stuff, instead of putting your event handlers inline.
[13:55:32] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: if you look into console, I've updated that jsbin, you can see that adding to database is happening before rest call
[13:56:01] <Horacsio> I really don't get why in the google font website the font renders well...
[13:56:08] <duch_kazatel> fyi you'd have to send out a new link since it pumps out new URLs for edits ;).  either way, you're expecting AJAX to operate syncronously.
[13:56:08] <frojnd> "About to add" and then empty
[13:56:17] <duch_kazatel> which it isn't.
[13:56:21] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: ok
[13:56:26] <frojnd> back to basics
[13:57:00] <duch_kazatel> so abstract out your handler for $("#myButton").click(function() {
[13:57:03] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[13:58:57] <Horacsio> If I use -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; the other browsers get the same font effect as safari
[13:59:08] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio which ones?
[13:59:17] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio that will only target browsers that use webkit.
[13:59:26] <Horacsio> FF and Chrome
[13:59:43] <duch_kazatel> then you must have done something wrong, because FF should ignore that.
[13:59:52] <blackf0rk> Horacsio did you read my last msg to you?
[14:00:09] <Horacsio> no FF is not antialiazing
[14:00:19] <Horacsio> sorry
[14:00:26] <Horacsio> chrome and safari does
[14:00:31] <blackf0rk> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1664862/rg/Pp9rx.gif
[14:00:54] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio right - that would target webkit browsers >.>
[14:01:10] <Horacsio> so how do I don't initialize? :D
[14:01:13] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:01:15] <Horacsio> antialiaze :D
[14:01:19] <Horacsio> sorry
[14:01:19] <duch_kazatel> remove that line.
[14:01:31] <Horacsio> that was how it was before :D
[14:01:59] <duch_kazatel> you might be better off asking somewhere like ##css at this point, because it feels like you're working towards a munge.
[14:02:29] <blackf0rk> i love mungecake
[14:02:33] <duch_kazatel> :D
[14:02:35] <duch_kazatel> so terrible
[14:02:50] <checkit> How can I serialize this data? I need to for post... http://jsfiddle.net/FZRk2/1/
[14:02:54] <Horacsio> blackf0rk: to do that I had to have a different css depending on browser! that's way I would need to check browser somehow :D
[14:03:10] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio that is a bad idea.
[14:03:31] <blackf0rk> Horacsio: I guess I don't fully understand your problem then.
[14:03:36] <Horacsio> but how do I use different font weights, depending on browser?
[14:03:41] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio don't do that.
[14:04:03] <blackf0rk> Horacsio: why do you want to use different font-weights for browsers?
[14:04:14] <duch_kazatel> blackf0rk because safari is giving them problems.
[14:04:54] <blackf0rk> duch_kazatel: yea, if you try to apply a different weight to a google font, it will.
[14:05:05] <Horacsio> duch_kazatel: what would be the best option then?
[14:05:08] <blackf0rk> you can't apply a different weight to Exo 2 Thin
[14:05:27] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio don't use Exo 2.  use a different font.  or use the file that is correctly sides.
[14:05:29] <duch_kazatel> *sized
[14:05:51] <blackf0rk> Horacsio: You haven't answered WHY you need to use a different weight for different browser. Don't you want the Web site to look the same in all browsers?
[14:06:09] <duch_kazatel> blackf0rk I told you - safari is giving them problems with this font.
[14:06:09] <Horacsio> which file are you talking about?
[14:06:29] <duch_kazatel> if he increases the weight of the font via CSS for safari, it fixes his issue.
[14:06:30] <Horacsio> member:blackf0rk safari renders the font weight diferently
[14:06:36] <Horacsio> that's it
[14:06:56] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio you should probably use a different font in that case.
[14:07:05] <Horacsio> hhmmm...
[14:07:05] <blackf0rk> Horacsio: make sure your font-weight is either not set to anything, or is set to normal
[14:07:12] <blackf0rk> don't apply a different dont-weight to it
[14:07:26] <duch_kazatel> blackf0rk if they leave the font-weight alone, it looks bad in safari.
[14:07:40] <blackf0rk> do you have a link?
[14:07:44] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: cc I don't know how to abstract it in js :s
[14:07:45] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio search around on Google for some better solutions, instead of using browser detection.
[14:07:58] <duch_kazatel> frojnd do you know how to write functions?>
[14:08:02] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: yes
[14:08:03] <Horacsio> but server-side is ok?
[14:08:15] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio still hacky - I would avoid it.
[14:08:33] <blackf0rk> Horacsio: do you have a link?
[14:08:50] <duch_kazatel> frojd so think about how you might write functions to replace the body of those callbacks.
[14:09:20] <Horacsio> yes but need your ip's because it's a undermaintenance
[14:09:22] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: and only for $("#myButton").click(function() { ... }) not document ready function?
[14:09:49] <duch_kazatel> frojnd for now, yes.
[14:11:28] <duch_kazatel> frojd we'll also cover why $(document).ready(function() { and document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() { are redundant ;)
[14:13:05] <frojnd> can't wait duch_kazatel  :) ok let's try and wrap those callbacks into a function
[14:13:22] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:13:49] <duch_kazatel> luckily, you're not yet binding anything to the this object within that first function, so that part should be pretty easy.
[14:15:19] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:16:51] <Horacsio> is there any difference between @import, <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/ and the javascript way?
[14:19:45] <snover> yes
[14:20:06] <Horacsio> what's the more accurate way?
[14:20:13] <snover> @import requires your first stylesheet to be loaded before it can load the second stylesheet, and the javascript way requires javascript
[14:21:21] <Horacsio> so...
[14:23:07] <duch_kazatel> back
[14:23:22] <Horacsio> guys are you getting PVT from anantaa: show gratis (solo hooy) ?
[14:23:37] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio yes, it's spam.
[14:23:47] <Horacsio> duch: blackf0rk solved it :D
[14:23:56] <Horacsio> Ok, Safari is disabling subpixel antialising at that font size. All you need to do is add "-webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased" to your UL a elements
[14:24:05] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[14:24:19] <duch_kazatel> still browser-based, but much less hacky than user agent detection.
[14:24:47] <blackf0rk> duch_kazatel: what would be a non-browser-based solution?
[14:24:54] <duch_kazatel> not using that font :)
[14:24:59] <blackf0rk> lol
[14:25:17] <duch_kazatel> also: if you're going use that font, download it and host it yourself - google is slooowwwww
[14:25:44] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: wrapping e.g. user.done to a function named userdone won't work
[14:25:57] <duch_kazatel> frojnd wat.  fiddle it please?
[14:25:58] <frojnd> I mean I'd have to call it somwhere
[14:26:03] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: in a second
[14:26:17] <duch_kazatel> frojnd right - you would abstract it and call that instead.
[14:27:24] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/jufaq/1/edit there
[14:27:35] <Horacsio> well thank you all, once again ;)
[14:27:50] <duch_kazatel> frojnd woah - you're... not getting what i'm saying.
[14:28:11] <duch_kazatel> put it back pls.
[14:28:22] <duch_kazatel> wait nvm got it.
[14:28:42] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: put it back
[14:28:58] <frojnd> it's without function now
[14:29:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/huvojahi/1/edit
[14:29:51] <duch_kazatel> you'd start there instead.
[14:31:04] <duch_kazatel> see what I did?
[14:31:31] <duch_kazatel> you could also do what you did, but you'd need to do it outside of that click handler function.
[14:31:53] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: yeah, you created getUserData() function
[14:32:19] <duch_kazatel> right - that way you can call that.  the idea here is to abstract out all those functions and call them when you need the,
[14:32:20] <duch_kazatel> *them.
[14:32:41] <duch_kazatel> that way you can click a button to run one, then another button to run the other, and have a third button that does both.
[14:33:20] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: those callbacks will become functions within function
[14:33:48] <duch_kazatel> frojnd and?
[14:33:48] <frojnd> eh..
[14:33:50] <duch_kazatel> you'
[14:33:53] <duch_kazatel> *you're doing that all ready.
[14:36:58] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: so what I just did is not ok?
[14:37:38] <frojnd> user.done(function(response, status) { .. }); I don't know how to transform this into a function
[14:38:12] <frojnd> because done is a object of user in this scenario
[14:39:04] <frojnd> can you see the changes I made duch_kazatel?
[14:47:00] <duch_kazatel> back
[14:47:11] <Horacsio> ok I have a new question:
[14:47:14] <obert> front
[14:47:23] <duch_kazatel> frojnd are you familiar with what promises are?
[14:47:37] <Horacsio> I want a div with several backgrounds cross dissolving very very slowly...
[14:48:05] <Horacsio> https://github.com/malsup/cycle2 or http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ ?
[14:48:54] <Horacsio> back :D
[14:49:31] <Horacsio> what is the easiest and better way to do it?
[14:49:44] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: no. I only have basic knowladge of functions, dom and ajax really basic
[14:49:45] <duch_kazatel> frojnd those can stay the same - you mostly just need to worry about the handlers for the click evem
[14:50:01] <duch_kazatel> frojnd I would go learn about promises and asyncronous programming then.
[14:50:35] <duch_kazatel> but the idea here is that you need to abstract out the event handlers.
[14:51:38] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: that part I get
[14:51:55] <duch_kazatel> because of how you've done everything, you don't need to abstract further.
[14:52:49] <frojnd> with getUserData() call I can get rest request/response
[14:52:55] <frojnd> manually..
[14:53:13] <duch_kazatel> huh?  I was trying to give you a basic idea of what you need to do.
[14:53:45] <duch_kazatel> later on, the idea will be that the third button click will call the first function and chain the second function into the done() callback.
[14:55:15] <duch_kazatel> that's why I suggested that you read up about promises/deferreds
[14:56:11] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: yeah, I have to. Also, did you mean to abstract callback by itself?
[14:56:18] <frojnd> e.g. user.done
[14:56:32] <duch_kazatel> you don't need to abstract those out quite yet.
[14:56:39] <duch_kazatel> or at all, depending on how you do things :)
[14:56:55] <Horacsio> so cycle or cycle2? :S
[14:57:54] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio cycle2 probably since the first one says to check out the second.
[14:58:05] <Horacsio> :)
[14:58:28] <Horacsio> ok I need to do simple cross dissolving between a list of uploaded images
[14:58:38] <Horacsio> what would be the best choice?
[14:58:54] <duch_kazatel> my answer isn't going to change between those two.
[14:59:09] <duch_kazatel> unless you can find a compelling reason to use the old one, use the new one.
[14:59:15] <Horacsio> ok is there one easier than other?
[14:59:17] <Horacsio> ok
[14:59:18] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: so now I have to create some sort of eventListener for third button and within this event listern I must first call first function function getUserData() and after it addPerson(person)
[14:59:20] <Horacsio> thank you :)
[14:59:39] <duch_kazatel> frojnd right, but you need to call that second one using the .done() method from the first.
[15:00:31] <frojnd> heh first I have to find out what kind of eventListenr :)
[15:00:43] <duch_kazatel> .on('click', function(){});
[15:00:47] <duch_kazatel> for that third button.
[15:01:12] <Horacsio> I don't like minified versions. why should'nt I use the regular version?
[15:01:40] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio faster transmission time in production.
[15:01:56] <Horacsio> ok :) HEY THANK YOU
[15:02:25] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:09:40] <duch_kazatel> back
[15:14:15] <vmarcetic> Hey all, I have a problem with jquery animate not working with newest version of jquery.
[15:14:49] <vmarcetic> Its defined as func under $.fn.animate, but its just not working. Not throwing any errors either
[15:15:11] <vmarcetic> Anyone? ≥.≥
[15:15:53] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/huvojahi/2/edit <- like this?
[15:16:38] <frojnd> duch_kazatel: dont't know how to call call second function using the .done method from first one
[15:19:49] <duch_kazatel> frojnd that's why I suggested you read about deferred objects :)
[15:20:59] <frojnd> hehe ok
[15:40:22] <maxnewb> Hey, I'm having some issues getting ajax queries to work with php in jquery, can anyone help me?
[15:40:33] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ maxnewb
[15:40:33] <b-ot> maxnewb: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:42:53] <maxnewb> So, I'm working on a small project just for learning purposes.  Everything's been going swimmingly up until now.  I have a PHP file with some functions in it, and I want to call them via ajax when certain events are triggered in my jQuery script.  I've got a small demo that I have set up to show my problem.  Here's the main page:
[15:42:58] <maxnewb> https://gist.github.com/eternalwormdevoursconnecticut/321e64889d667a1266ac
[15:43:11] <maxnewb> Here's the PHP Script:https://gist.github.com/eternalwormdevoursconnecticut/821081e57e351b97d4de
[15:43:22] <maxnewb> and the jquery script: https://gist.github.com/eternalwormdevoursconnecticut/ddd39d14461733fce0cb
[15:43:48] <duch_kazatel> maxnewb there's no such thing as "jquery script" - fyi
[15:44:21] <duch_kazatel> so what about this are you having difficulties with
[15:44:21] <duch_kazatel> ?
[15:44:43] <maxnewb> Right, it's javascript then?  When my alert pops up, instead of containing the string I was expecting to be returned from my PHP function, there's nothing but a blank string.
[15:45:08] <duch_kazatel> maxnewb try console.log(re) instead and look at your console.
[15:45:12] <duch_kazatel> what do you see?
[15:45:24] <maxnewb> That's what I had before, all I see are quotes: ""
[15:45:54] <duch_kazatel> maxnewb that means the response from your PHP is an empty string.
[15:46:10] <maxnewb> Why is that?  Shouldn't the string be filled with the return from my function?
[15:46:23] <duch_kazatel> I'm not familiar with PHP, so I wouldn't know.
[15:46:42] <duch_kazatel> try to hit your script using your browser and see what you get.
[15:47:31] <maxnewb> When I hit it with my browser I see the expected return - a string: "success"
[15:48:08] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[15:49:06] <maxnewb> Yeah I'm very confused as to why it's not returning the string to javascript
[15:49:18] <duch_kazatel> try removing the data from the ajax.
[15:49:20] <duch_kazatel> see what happens.
[15:50:43] <maxnewb> Awe yeah, that worked!  Any reason I shouldn't have been using "text"?  What is the default data setting for $.ajax?
[15:51:10] <duch_kazatel> maxnewb you were setting data twice.
[15:51:15] <duch_kazatel> you needed only the first one.
[15:51:28] <duch_kazatel> perhaps you meant dataType ?
[15:51:34] <maxnewb> Yeah, that is what I meant
[15:52:01] <maxnewb> Looks like that's working.  Thanks a bunch!
[15:52:06] <duch_kazatel> of course
[15:52:12] <maxnewb> have a nice day :)
[16:05:37] <kidem> hello, im new to jquery im trying to get a multistep form to validate - im tried so many things but cant get it to work when in multistep here is code im tryin to get it to work on http://codebin.org/view/77d9ebf3
[16:06:35] <duch_kazatel> kidem can you make a functioning example in jsfiddle.com?
[16:06:52] <kidem> yeah give me a sec
[16:13:01] <kidem> duch_kazatel - http://jsfiddle.net/4n68q/
[16:13:47] <kidem> when clicking next it doesnt validate - i just added a submit button on last page and validation seem to work just for that page when click on submit
[16:14:24] <duch_kazatel> kidem where's the documentation for that particular plugin?
[16:14:57] <kidem> http://kylemitofsky.com/jquery.multistep/
[16:15:47] <duch_kazatel> kidem okay - so what did you use for your step selector?
[16:17:14] <kidem> step selector? not sure i follow like i said im learning as i go never even code before heh
[16:17:27] <duch_kazatel> kidem look at the documentation for the plugin: http://kylemitofsky.com/jquery.multistep/
[16:17:35] <duch_kazatel> down at the bottom - the part titled "javascript"
[16:18:03] <kidem> yeah i see it i added it in a min ago but no diff
[16:18:07] <duch_kazatel> what are you expecting to happen when you click each button?
[16:18:21] <duch_kazatel> because it's functioning as I would expect.
[16:18:36] <kidem> goes to next page like it should but does require the fields to have data like i want
[16:18:45] <kidem> doesnt
[16:19:08] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to use the onBeforeShowNextStep callback to handle that.
[16:19:19] <kidem> if i put a submit on each page i think it works but its a step so needs to be next
[16:19:34] <duch_kazatel> right - you need to cancel the event if that step didn't validate.
[16:21:00] <kidem> ok how do i use that i guess is the noob question now lol
[16:21:30] <kidem> jquery is very cool - but with no prgram background its brain mashin
[16:21:43] <duch_kazatel> onBeforeShowNextStep: function() {/* your stuff here */ }
[16:22:13] <kidem> ohhh i think i see
[16:22:16] <kidem> let me try
[16:22:36] <duch_kazatel> getting it?
[16:23:00] <kidem> i do that in the js area right or the html like wrap it around <div> inputs </div>
[16:23:01] <kidem> ?
[16:23:08] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:23:12] <kidem> lol
[16:23:25] <duch_kazatel> you should probably go read some basics first.
[16:23:25] <kidem> on jsfiddle js area
[16:24:05] <duch_kazatel> onBeforeShowNextStep: function() {/* your stuff here */ }
[16:24:11] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4n68q/1/
[16:44:28] <w00tb3ast> Is it possible to write a function that will be run if the clients date matches
[16:44:39] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast sure.
[16:44:49] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast write the function, then a simple if check.
[16:44:53] <w00tb3ast> ie like if ( clients.date = '1/4/2014') kinda thing
[16:45:07] <duch_kazatel> yeah - check out the Date() contructor.
[16:45:10] <duch_kazatel> *constructor
[16:45:37] <w00tb3ast> thanks duch_kazatel I'll take a look
[17:13:45] <corpster> hi, is it possible to select the last TR in a table that DOESNT have a name='innertable'   i have tried:
[17:13:47] <corpster>  $('#myPlaceHolder tr:last').not("[name='innertable']").numberField(fieldArray[i]);
[17:13:54] <corpster> but that just select nothing if the last tr has this name
[17:14:25] <duch_kazatel> corpster right, because you're reducing to the last one and the reducing that selecton to those that don't have name="innertable"
[17:14:57] <corpster> yeah.. i figured that..
[17:15:12] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to manually iterate through each one until you find the last one, then either reference back to the one you stored, or back up by one.
[17:15:21] <duch_kazatel> there's also: https://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[17:15:35] <duch_kazatel> so you could nextUntil, then get the last one that matches.
[17:16:21] <duch_kazatel> note that these operations can be quite slow - you should probably process server-side and add classes you can target to the appropriate data, instea.
[17:16:23] <duch_kazatel> *instead
[17:16:44] <corpster> nexgt unti..
[17:16:50] <corpster> cool. speed shouldnt matter
[17:16:55] <corpster> i mean there will only be like 10- 20 MAX
[17:16:58] <corpster> so im sure that'll be fine
[17:17:11] <corpster> server side isnt an option :(
[17:17:13] <duch_kazatel> you're running a regex on the tags.
[17:19:21] <w00tb3ast> duch_kazatel I can't seem to figure it out I have got: var foolsDate = new Date(2014,2,31,18:20);
[17:19:36] <w00tb3ast> and then if(foolsDate === $.now()){ //function }
[17:19:41] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast huh?
[17:19:56] <duch_kazatel> are you just trying to get the current date?
[17:20:15] <w00tb3ast> I just want the if case to run if now is later than foolsDate
[17:24:08] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/e49uU/
[17:24:17] <duch_kazatel> no idea where you got var foolsDate = new Date(2014,2,31,18:20); from
[17:24:56] <duch_kazatel> and you probably want to know if today is foolsdate.
[17:25:48] <w00tb3ast> I made it
[17:25:59] <w00tb3ast> I thought you could set a new date to a variable
[17:26:07] <duch_kazatel> you can - I just did it.
[17:27:03] <w00tb3ast> but now how to I see if now is after foolsDate
[17:27:38] <duch_kazatel> did you look at the fiddle?
[17:27:46] <duch_kazatel> don't you want to see if it's 4/1
[17:27:51] <duch_kazatel> not after 4/1?
[17:28:29] <w00tb3ast> oh sorry hang on looking now I didn't see the link before
[17:29:29] <Spami> I have this: $('a.load-more').on( "click", function() that does not get trigger when I click on it. html link is generated through other query events
[17:29:44] <duch_kazatel> Spami because you're binding to something that doesn't exist.
[17:30:13] <duch_kazatel> Spami use event delegation instead - $('parent').on('click', 'a.load-more', function() { /* your code here */});
[17:30:34] <duch_kazatel> parent can be any ancestor that exists at time of binding - anything in your html is generally safe.
[17:30:57] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i'm off to band practice.
[17:31:03] <duch_kazatel> enjoy everybody, and have a good evening!
[17:31:04] <tw2113> nerd :P
[17:31:09] <duch_kazatel> duh!

I have a JSON response that I am currently populating a dropdown box with (ex: Item A, Item B, Item C).  If a user selects any Item from the drop down box, I want to then populate fields of a form (on the same page) from the JSON response (i.e. User selects Item B, populate form with all informati
[21:47:20] <stock584> on pertaining to Item B in the JSON response).  Could anyone point me in the general direction of where I should learn more to figure this out?

[21:52:36] <sdwrage> kongthap, json_encode is useful for that
[21:54:02] <kongthap> sdwrage, thanks for your reply, if i use $json = json_encode($myarray), then i can just refer in the jquery coding like this $.ajax({data: $json}) ?
[21:54:27] <sdwrage> I believe so... let me double check. This is more of a php question btw
[21:55:53] <kongthap> sdwrage, i don't think php variable can be available within <script></script> which jquery coding is located, please guide me i really stuck
[21:56:41] <sdwrage> php is always server side so whatever you print to a var is available client side
[21:57:32] <sdwrage> I can do var myname = "<?php echo $name; ?>";  and get something like var myname = "guys name";
[21:58:21] <kongthap> sdwrage, i will try and may be will need your help little bit more :)
[21:59:06] <sdwrage> kongthap, if I am still awake lol. I still have a lot of client work to do and very little waking time :P
[21:59:24] <kongthap> :)
[22:02:01] <kongthap> sdwrage, please take a look my coding http://pastie.org/8984480
[22:03:10] <Uhkis> kongthap: those inputs are from a form, right?
[22:03:57] <kongthap> Uhkis, my real case i have to mix input data from form with some php array
[22:04:51] <kongthap> Uhkis, right now my problem is i don't know how to translate php array to use with the jquery coding
[22:04:55] <Uhkis> well, you should still keep php and js separated
[22:05:31] <Uhkis> is there an actual reason you're trying to force the php stuff in the js?
[22:05:38] <kongthap> Uhkis, right now to for simplicity on testing can i combine them first, is it going to work
[22:05:39] <kongthap> ?
[22:06:16] <Uhkis> when you send the ajax to the php script, why isn't the combining done on the php side?
[22:06:19] <kongthap> Uhkis, yes the gole is i want to post the data in this file as json to another php file
[22:06:28] <kongthap> *goal
[22:07:13] <sdwrage> uhkis, don't agree with that statement at all with regards to php and js
[22:07:37] <kongthap> 1.php will get user input via form, do little processing and post data to 2.php as json
[22:07:44] <sdwrage> let us pretend we are using JQuery and PHP to use $_GET['tab'] for a selector.
[22:08:22] <Uhkis> kongthap: so why isn't the processing done in the 2.php ?
[22:09:24] <kongthap> Uhkis, on 1.php processing i meant by like shaping the input
[22:10:16] <kongthap> actually my role is coding processing on 2.php
[22:10:35] <Uhkis> kongthap: i still don't see any reason why isn't it done in 2
[22:11:02] <kongthap> Uhkis, ok my explanation is too bad
[22:11:58] <kongthap> Uhkis, so let make the question is that if i have some php array, how can i ajax it ?
[22:13:10] <Uhkis> as was said earlier, json_encode
[22:13:41] <kongthap> because input doesn't come from only user input, it come from like client info too
[22:15:06] <kongthap> Uhkis, i have put json_encode() in the coding http://pastie.org/8984496, but my problem is i don't know how to use it inside <script></script>
[22:15:57] <Uhkis> i'd say your problem is that i can easily change all those values and send bogus data to your 2.php ;-)
[22:16:43] <kongthap> Uhkis, can you guide me please i tried this var json_data = "<?php echo $json; ?>"; but it's error, i don't understand the concept
[22:22:27] <Uhkis> how is it error?
[22:23:48] <PatBateman> morning
[22:24:38] <PatBateman> is it possible to realize to fill Jquery UI inline Datepicker with data trough ajax, when a user changes month?
[22:26:16] <kongthap> Uhkis, right now i use var json_data=<?php echo json_encode($inputs); ?>; it's no longer error but when i use alert(json_data) i got [object Object] is this corrent?
[22:26:24] <kongthap> *correct
[22:26:48] <Uhkis> kongthap: use console.log instead of alerts
[22:27:46] <kongthap> Uhkis, ok it's good looking in console.log :)
[22:31:25] <kongthap> Uhkis, is this object http://i.cubeupload.com/veYyWR.png can be used in $.ajax() right away ?
[22:32:20] <kongthap> Uhkis, use for data parameter of $.ajax()
[22:32:56] <Uhkis> yes
[22:33:18] <Uhkis> you may need the dataType: "json" too
[22:39:49] <kongthap> i tried this http://pastie.org/8984539 but there is not error and the console just display nothing
[22:44:46] <kongthap> when send data to 2.php, after processing something 2.php will send json back to 1.php, the ajax call can both post and get the response at once ?
[22:46:46] <ph1> hey all - I have 3 dropdown lists Country, Province, City that are chained, with a default empty value of: country = Select first, province = Slect Country First, and city is Select Province first. That's handled by the php code. If a country is selected, then by clicking the country list again and selecting the 'Please Select First' I get an error. Can someone help me so when the empty selection is selected again it resets all 3 dropdowns back to defaults? here
[22:46:46] <ph1> is my jquery code: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/74141801
[22:48:46] <ph1> I just don't want an error thrown basically, I would like the box values to be set back to an empty state, and my ajax code should then set the appropriate value for each dropdown
[22:52:45] <beachandbytes> ph1, just check to see if a valid country is selected, if not clear all selects
[22:56:20] <ph1> how do I do that in the code for country for example?
[22:56:33] <ph1> then I can apply the same for province and city
[22:57:12] <ph1> beachandbytes, ^^
[22:57:43] <beachandbytes> post a jsfiddle and ill fix it up for ya
[22:59:35] <ph1> beachandbytes, hmm ok I will try but not sure if it will work because there are 3 components, the php, script, and ajax but I'll see how it goes
[22:59:52] <beachandbytes> just mock the php calls
[22:59:56] <beachandbytes> with a few static items
[23:02:40] <ph1> beachandbytes, gawd - you know you're talking with a complete noob :P
[23:02:59] <beachandbytes> ph1
[23:03:05] <beachandbytes> something like this
[23:03:06] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/xf9KU/
[23:04:58] <ph1> ok I'll givethat one a go
[23:18:49] <Besan> Take a look at this please: http://jsbin.com/ruzat/1/edit?js,output
[23:19:06] <ph1> beachandbytes, ok cool that sort of works. The dropdown boxes are cleared which is what I want. But i need to extend the logic in here: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/827870975 to include if the value is 0 then process the else statement. Can you help me with that?
[23:19:32] <Besan> How can i load data without collapsing the "collapsible" ?
[23:19:56] <ph1> beachandbytes, for example if (!empty($countryCities)) and !=0
[23:20:56] <beachandbytes> sorry I don't use php much
[23:21:08] <beachandbytes> might try setting the option to '' instead of 0 in the javascript
[23:21:12] <beachandbytes> might avoid having to change the php
[23:21:34] <Besan> beachandbytes, what about JQM ?
[23:21:37] <ph1> beachandbytes, ok cool I'll give that a try
[23:21:38] <beachandbytes> I really should learn php one of the few languages I am noob at
[23:21:53] <ph1> beachandbytes, show off :P
[23:22:19] <ph1> me I'm noob at all languages :P
[23:22:26] <ph1> *in
[23:22:34] <ph1> lol including english it would seem :P
[23:24:04] <Besan> So, back to my question . . .
[23:24:08] <Besan> Any ideas ?
[23:24:26] <Besan> Let me pull out my jsbin once again: http://jsbin.com/ruzat/1/edit?js,output
[23:24:58] <Besan> Who's gonna be the hero tonight ? :)
[23:26:39] <beachandbytes> Besan what's the problem?
[23:27:18] <Besan> How can i keep the "collapsible" state unchanged on setTimeout()  ?
[23:27:26] <Besan> How can i keep the "collapsible" state unchanged on setTimeout()  ?
[23:27:32] <Besan> http://jsbin.com/ruzat/1/edit?js,output
[23:27:39] <Besan> Here is my jsbin again
[23:28:36] <Besan> Every 5 seconds i'm updating data from and i need to keep collapsible unchanged even if new data is loaded
[23:28:56] <ph1> beachandbytes, nice that works - but it doesn't actually clear the data in the array. is there any way to clear the array itself or will that have to be in the php side of it?
[23:31:57] <beachandbytes> ph1 probably the php side
[23:32:45] <ph1> ok cheers thanks for the assistance
[23:34:21] <Besan> beachandbytes ?
[23:42:27] <beachandbytes> Besan, sorry was watching my trades
[23:42:29] <beachandbytes> give me one second
[23:42:40] <Besan> sure :)
[23:42:52] <Besan> Take your time, no rush :)
