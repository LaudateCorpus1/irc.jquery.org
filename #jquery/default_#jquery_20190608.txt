[20:11:12] <node8js713> what did I miss?
[20:16:32] <poboy> node8js713: https://jsfiddle.net/pk10omq7/
[20:17:01] <poboy> you didn't have jquery selected as the framework, and no script tag needed
[20:17:07] <Buoy172> what's going on here
[20:17:16] <Buoy172> poboy: it still doesn't work like that
[20:17:30] <Buoy172> those numbers are supposed to show something when you move the slider
[20:24:30] <node8js713> poboy: is a same code that I posted.
[20:24:51] <Buoy172> node8js713: to me your code looks ok
[20:25:20] <node8js713> Buoy172: yea but it doesn't work.
[20:25:38] <node8js713> supposed to change numbers when I move slider
[20:29:58] <Buoy172> https://jsfiddle.net/3Lghv750/
[20:30:10] <poboy> node8js713: you selected vanilla js instead of jquery
[20:30:12] <Buoy172> you had some non existing function there
[20:30:37] <poboy> that's why those })]] were displayed on the screen
[20:31:16] <node8js713> what do you mean?
[20:32:23] <Buoy172> hey did you see my solution?
[20:34:23] <node8js713> Buoy172: yes, but I don't understand why.
[20:34:36] <node8js713> it's look same code for me.
[20:34:39] <node8js713> to me*
[20:34:45] <Buoy172> it's not same
[20:35:06] <Buoy172> I erased the first 2 lines of document.ready
[20:38:04] <node8js713> but those are separate events
[20:38:15] <node8js713> why could they effect them?
[20:38:43] <Buoy172> does my example work for you?
[20:38:51] <node8js713> yes.
[20:39:21] <node8js713> but applying on my website, no.
[20:39:32] <Buoy172> they're not separate events
[20:40:00] <Buoy172> those are function calls to nonexistent functions
[20:40:24] <node8js713> I try create separate <script></script> but not working.
[20:40:55] <node8js713> those are the custom functions from other files it exist funciotns.
[20:41:12] <Buoy172> they don't exist in the jsfiddle
[20:41:40] <node8js713> either way, the code is not working on my website.
[20:48:40] <Buoy172> is your site online
[20:49:45] <node8js713> Buoy172:  unfortunately no.
[20:52:41] <Buoy172> is it a big site
[20:54:08] <node8js713> Buoy172: well, some how now it's working, =_- strangely...
[20:54:16] <Buoy172> lol
[20:55:02] <node8js713> I divide other scripts from one <script> to make two.
