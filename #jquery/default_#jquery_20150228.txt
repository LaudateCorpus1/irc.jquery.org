[01:49:10] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[02:48:42] <EEEDDD> Hi, I'm trying jQuery Mobile. How to use links to anchors in the same page, e.g. for a content-menu ?
[03:08:22] <ajf-> Can anyone help me with this situation here? Click the buttons and the problem shall be revealed to you: http://jsfiddle.net/7Lo86hy2/
[03:11:04] <ajf-> At least any sort of indication of what I'm doing wrong ?
[03:11:20] <ajf-> I'd think that namespacing the click events would prevent this problem
[03:21:07] <ajf-> I need a jQuery Master
[03:41:09] <Sal> hi
[03:41:54] <Sal> if i load some html code using ajax-php, can i also add some inline jquery to it?
[03:42:06] <Sal> will it be loaded as soon as i append the html?
[03:42:22] <Sal> or do i need to do some extra coding for it
[04:10:15] <Juslintek> Hey anyone familiar with highcharts, if yes, how to add to xAxis not the the labels but the name of the xAxis so people would know what are these numbers.
[04:26:15] <Raydiation> hi does jquery support a nice way to get url parameters?
[04:26:29] <Raydiation> all the stuff that you find how to solve it is a bit weird
[04:26:38] <Cork> Raydiation: not natively no
[04:26:56] <Cork> there are plugins for parsing the search variable
[04:27:00] <Raydiation> yep
[04:27:01] <Cork> or you can do it your self
[04:27:07] <Raydiation> seems like such a common task
[04:27:15] <Cork> it isn't really
[04:27:24] <Cork> and jquery is for dom modificaitons
[04:27:34] <Cork> it is meant to only do that (and stuff it needs internally)
[04:28:22] <Cork> if you bake everything into core it means everyone has to load it, even if they don't need it
[04:29:45] <Raydiation> right, jquery is included almost anywhere
[04:29:51] <Raydiation> so its important that its small
[04:30:02] <Raydiation> went for purl
[04:30:50] <Raydiation> argh
[04:30:52] <Raydiation> no longer maintained :D
[04:46:42] <Xatenev> morning peeps
[06:38:21] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone knows any plugin to acces to a webcam?
[06:41:01] <Kamuela> are scroll effects achieved with an onWithinWindow or some kind of event like that?
[06:44:48] <Xatenev> abailarri: https://www.scriptcam.com/
[06:45:10] <abailarri> Xatenev, but with ths is necesary to get flash
[06:45:14] <abailarri> any alternatve?
[06:45:26] <Xatenev> no idea
[06:45:28] <Xatenev> ive used that some time ago
[07:27:55] <jaakey> hi
[07:28:12] <stephen> What is the standard stack of shims these days to get HTML5 support IE9+?
[07:28:25] <stephen> Are we still using modernizr + select polyfills?
[07:38:48] <ThoMe> hihio
[07:38:53] <ThoMe> have a image with visibility: hidden;
[07:39:11] <ThoMe> when i try $('.artikelHinzufuegen').show(); then doesnt works
[07:39:43] <ThoMe> is show not visibility: visible ? and hide = visibility: hidden; ?
[07:40:10] <jaakey> I think .show() works on the display attribute
[07:40:34] <jaakey> try .css('visibility', 'visible')
[07:40:37] <ThoMe> jaakey: ah, ok. display: none is hidden() ?
[07:40:56] <ThoMe> jaakey: hmm. is visibility:hidden and display: none the same?
[07:41:30] <jaakey> nope. the former only makes it unseeable, but still reserves the space it would take. The latter doesn't even show the space it would take
[07:42:16] <ThoMe> Ã¶hm. ok :-)
[07:44:21] <esko> is anyone in here using selectize.js?
[08:05:07] <ThoMe> jaakey: huhu?
[08:05:18] <jaakey> ?
[08:06:00] <ThoMe> jaakey: i add dynamic a element with a button, when i click on this button, i would like add another button. i must use live() or?
[08:07:36] <jaakey> do you want to make a new button?
[08:07:47] <jaakey> or do you have it in the html already
[08:08:45] <ThoMe> the first button is already in my html. class=blub example. when i click to "blub" i would like a another button, also "blub" as class. butwhen i click on this button then doesnt works
[08:08:52] <ThoMe> on() ?
[08:13:59] <jaakey> well it depends on how the button exists before you want to enable it
[08:14:19] <ThoMe> jaakey: hm. i try $('.knopfBedarfPositionHinzufuegen').on('click', function () {
[08:14:21] <ThoMe> but doesnt works
[08:14:35] <ThoMe> the knopfBedarfPositionHinzufuegen-elements i add dynamic.
[08:15:01] <jaakey> well what do you want to happen when you click it?
[08:15:28] <ThoMe> example alert("Hello World");
[08:15:29] <jaakey> $(this).addClass('blub') ?
[08:16:25] <jaakey> thats strange, if the button with that class isn't getting the click event when you click it, that's not how things should be working
[08:16:29] <jaakey> you could try .click
[08:16:36] <jaakey> what version of jquery are you usiong?
[08:16:46] <ThoMe> 1.11.0
[08:17:15] <ThoMe> $(document).on("click", ".knopfBedarfPositionHinzufuegen", function (e) {
[08:17:17] <ThoMe> this works. fine.
[08:20:26] <jaakey> http://jsfiddle.net/u2msz2kL/
[08:22:11] <jaakey> ThoMe ^ check that out.. I don't know why the way you had it originally wasn't working but you might want to check aroung incase there is some hidden weirdness in your code
[08:27:50] <ThoMe> jaakey: hm ja :)
[08:32:14] <jaakey> ThoMe : http://jsfiddle.net/u2msz2kL/1/  I also updated it so it will randomly change the background color. because.. that's important. Very important.
[08:54:50] <Kamuela> in trying to better understand waypoints, i'm trying to figure out why something at the end of my page triggers as soon as the page loads
[08:56:20] <Kamuela> https://gist.github.com/KamuelaFranco/bd2c2c942bb3f80d75d9 <span id="end-of-page"></span>
[09:00:42] <jaakey> woah that's crazy, I didn't even know those existed.
[09:00:44] <jaakey> thats cool.
[09:03:36] <Kamuela> jaakey: it's a plugin i believe. not base jquery, but they are commonly used
[10:18:54] <tomasm-> hi, does anyone know what sort of libraries are out there that can shrink a sidebar menu to icons either on mobile or when being closed? here's an example: http://centaurus.adbee.technology/v5/
[11:56:09] <Jabby__> Hey guys, I'm new to ajax calls and javascript really and abit confused, if someone could help me that would be great :) So I'm wanting to create an ajax progress bar, my php script is going to echo the percentage complete. So i'm looking at this example here http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/ . Is this relevant to my needs?
[11:57:27] <Jabby__> if not, could someone point me in the right direction?
[12:11:29] <mezod> how can I know why an addClass is not working? the object I am applying it to exists and shows up on console.log. Additionally, the addClass does work in most of the clicks but sometimes it simply doesn't. In other words, how can I debug the cases when addClass doesn't work?
[13:12:14] <Jabby__> wow, is this channel dead? lol
[13:13:07] <BromeoAndCooliet> hi!
[13:13:57] <BromeoAndCooliet> I am trying to find all links on a page that point to a certain URL and then replace it with html. I am very stuck. Here is what I have so far: http://pastebin.com/vnTXdQyC
[13:37:02] <rcyr> This channel is always dead on weekends....
[13:37:44] <tw2113> jquery nerds need social lives too
[13:38:27] <rcyr> Except us, it seems.
[13:38:58] <rcyr> I guess it's because people don't use jQuery because it's "cool" but by necessity... and since it's the weekend, nobody wants to hear about it :P
[13:39:04] <tw2113> i'm not worrying about that topic much
[13:41:42] <BinaryKitten> evening
[13:42:00] <fkt> can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong.  i have nested objects inside of an object.  i'm trying to iterate through them.  the first $.each loop, i'm trying to take the ticker name and make an array with it.  in the second loop i want to .push data to that array.  i'm hoping the array will be named after ticker (VRNG or UGE).  http://pastebin.com/VBM5pZPH
[13:42:49] <fkt> so i'm expecting something like this for the first ticker  VRNG = [1424851200, -0.020857112, 1424937600, 0.018922871]
[13:45:18] <GingerGeek_> Hello magic people, I have a function which parses a CSV file and then individually calls an API for each row - is there an easy way for me to make it so the ajax request can happen like 100 at a time
[13:45:32] <GingerGeek_> They are all just queued at the moment waiting for previous ones to finish
[13:45:43] <Omar-> fkt http://jsfiddle.net/kqm645co/
[13:45:51] <GingerGeek_> http://gyazo.com/4432fc9a43a1f85ca4c1e0ff33f43645
[13:46:34] <GingerGeek_> Or does google chrome just not like 100 ajax requests queued up at once :/
[13:46:40] <GingerGeek_> *1000
[13:47:15] <Omar-> GingerGeek_ I guess you need to turn async off in $.ajax() function
[13:47:16] <fkt> Omar-: i wanted to create two seperate arrays.  one named  VRNG   the other  UGE
[13:47:29] <GingerGeek_> turn it off??!111???
[13:47:36] <fkt> Omar-:  i was trying to create the array with ticker name from first loop
[13:47:44] <Omar-> e.g. $.ajax({ async: false, etc... });
[13:48:41] <GingerGeek_> But surely that would make it slower?
[13:48:49] <GingerGeek_> Why would I want to do that?
[13:48:53] <GingerGeek_> I want it to go faster
[13:49:15] <GingerGeek_> I want to increase the number of ajaxes that can be run at one time
[13:51:27] <GingerGeek_> i.e I want to have 1000 requests happening all at once
[13:51:36] <GingerGeek_> not pending for others to finish
[13:53:39] <Omar-> fkt http://jsfiddle.net/kqm645co/1/
[13:54:31] <fkt> Omar-: what in the heck, that didn't work for me when I tried it!  well thanks, that's it.. let me see what I did incorrect
[13:54:32] <Omar-> GingerGeek_ I'm not experienced with Ajax, but I thought you want to process ajax calls all at once
[13:54:35] <fkt> Omar-: thanks :)
[13:54:47] <Omar-> fkt np :)
[13:55:03] <Omar-> fkt you added var before ticker
[13:55:21] <GingerGeek_> Omar-, yes I want 1000 ajax calls to run simultaneously
[13:55:27] <fkt> Oh!
[13:55:38] <fkt> Omar-: so that clears the value I guess?
[13:56:16] <rcyr> lol
[13:56:43] <Omar-> fkt yea, you wipe it
[13:56:48] <rcyr> GingerGeek_: The browsers limits you to 8 or 10 concurrent simultaneous connections
[13:56:55] <GingerGeek_> ahhh
[13:56:56] <GingerGeek_> kk
[13:56:58] <SgtPooki> GingerGeek: you can use  promises.. but yea, what rcyr says
[13:56:58] <GingerGeek_> That's fine
[13:57:01] <rcyr> A bit far from 1000
[13:57:05] <SgtPooki> quite a bit
[13:57:09] <Omar-> GingerGeek_ then make them  synchronous
[13:57:16] <SgtPooki> the http spec actually says 2 connection limit
[13:57:18] <GingerGeek_> They are fine async
[13:57:25] <SgtPooki> but browsers are at anywhere between 2-10 now
[13:57:38] <Omar-> async (default: true)
[13:57:39] <Omar-> By default, all requests are sent asynchronously (i.e. this is set to true by default). If you need synchronous requests, set this option to false. Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation. Note that synchronous requests may temporarily lock the browser, disabling any actions while the request is active.
[13:57:49] <GingerGeek_> It takes about 10 mins to get through all the requests lol
[13:57:56] <rcyr> You never want to lock the browser.
[13:57:58] <GingerGeek_> Omar-, I don't want sync
[13:58:03] <SgtPooki> still, 10 is far from 1000, but if your network requests are small, parallel requests using es6 Promise.all or similar will improve total wait time
[13:58:16] <GingerGeek_> rcyr, it's only locked for network requests
[13:58:26] <rcyr> GingerGeek_: And?
[13:58:38] <GingerGeek_> Welll is there a way to prioritise a request?
[13:58:43] <SgtPooki> nope
[13:58:53] <SgtPooki> call that ajax call first..
[13:59:03] <GingerGeek_> It's an import function that will get used once a year
[13:59:18] <GingerGeek_> If it stops the browser tab laoding anythig for a few mins
[13:59:22] <GingerGeek_> I think it's OK
[13:59:24] <GingerGeek_> and err
[13:59:26] <SgtPooki> GingerGeek, yea, that should be fine.. load up a gif and ensure its on screen before doing all the requests, you should be fine
[13:59:32] <SgtPooki> a spinnywheel
[13:59:48] <SgtPooki> however.. why only once a year imports? what are you doing?
[13:59:56] * SgtPooki is just curious
[14:00:05] <GingerGeek_> Importing students
[14:00:12] <GingerGeek_> This is it with some loveryly test data
[14:00:12] <GingerGeek_> http://gyazo.com/a984a4818fe8daf9f15e9dae120ae67f
[14:00:20] <SgtPooki> ah. thats gotta be cheaper than an airline ticket
[14:00:27] <SgtPooki> ....
[14:00:32] <GingerGeek_> err
[14:00:35] <GingerGeek_> Was that a joke?
[14:00:40] <SgtPooki> yes. haha
[14:00:45] <GingerGeek> I dun get it
[14:00:55] <SgtPooki> I didn't say it was a good joke
[14:01:01] <GingerGeek> lel
[14:01:07] <SgtPooki> you said "importing students.."
[14:01:14] <GingerGeek> ohhhhhhhhh
[14:01:14] <SgtPooki> foreign exchange student..
[14:01:16] <SgtPooki> plane ticket..
[14:01:19] <GingerGeek> OHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[14:01:25] <SgtPooki> haha
[14:01:31] <SgtPooki> it was pretty lame, not your fault
[14:01:43] <GingerGeek> it's fine im laughing now ;P
[14:02:18] <SgtPooki> so, yea. how are you calling all of your requests now?
[14:02:30] <GingerGeek> Exactly the same as before
[14:02:56] <SgtPooki> heh
[14:02:58] <SgtPooki> nice
[14:03:08] <SgtPooki> can you offload some of these requests to a server?
[14:03:17] <SgtPooki> instead of doing it on the client?
[14:03:48] <GingerGeek> I could be normal and parse the csv file on the server
[14:03:59] <GingerGeek> but meh
[14:04:09] <GingerGeek> It's coursework
[14:04:13] <GingerGeek> I have deadlines
[14:04:20] <SgtPooki> ah, homework
[14:04:24] <GingerGeek> noo
[14:04:30] <SgtPooki> coursework..?
[14:04:41] <GingerGeek> I'd call it more than homework
[14:04:58] <GingerGeek> It's a complete software thing
[14:05:12] <SgtPooki> ok, yea, either way
[14:05:16] <SgtPooki> hrm
[14:05:16] <GingerGeek> It's a year long project
[14:05:21] <SgtPooki> gotcha
[14:05:37] <SgtPooki> ok so, are you using promises with your current calls?
[14:05:46] <GingerGeek> ermmm
[14:05:47] <GingerGeek> no
[14:06:03] <GingerGeek> I parse the csv file
[14:06:04] <SgtPooki> ok so right now, you call one ajax request, wait for it to finish, then call another.. and repeat?
[14:06:09] <GingerGeek> No
[14:06:10] <GingerGeek> right now
[14:06:12] <SgtPooki> listening.
[14:06:43] <GingerGeek> I parse eacch row of the csv file and fire an async ajax request based on the data.
[14:07:10] <GingerGeek> idk wat promises are
[14:07:27] <GingerGeek> Im quite new to jquery
[14:07:29] <SgtPooki> thats fine, we can get into that
[14:07:54] <SgtPooki> so for each row in the csv, you fire an ajax request
[14:07:58] <SgtPooki> can you share that code snippet?
[14:08:48] <GingerGeek> There's not much to it
[14:09:18] <SgtPooki> haha
[14:09:43] <SgtPooki> how you implemented it will matter though
[14:10:01] <GingerGeek> http://paste.multicu.be/mamifedahi.xml
[14:10:16] <GingerGeek> form is a FormData object
[14:10:19] <SgtPooki> if you're doing while(row) { func(); row= newrow() }.. then you're promises are kind of already asynched
[14:10:30] <GingerGeek> Im usin papaparse
[14:10:44] <GingerGeek> and it's yeah per row
[14:10:47] <SgtPooki> ok good. I see that you're calling decrementRequests in your success callback
[14:11:02] <SgtPooki> so does the next rows request not get called until that function gets called..?
[14:11:07] <GingerGeek> Yeah I lock up the page so my client doesn't browse away etc
[14:11:13] <GingerGeek> and I keep track of all my requests
[14:11:16] <GingerGeek> once it gets to 0
[14:11:18] <GingerGeek> I release the page
[14:11:28] <SgtPooki> ok. You can still keep track of all requests
[14:11:38] <SgtPooki> you'll want to do some reading on Deferred
[14:11:44] <SgtPooki> ^ jqueries promise implementation
[14:11:52] <GingerGeek> I don't see why tho
[14:11:58] <GingerGeek> Is there somethign wrong with my implementation?
[14:12:03] <SgtPooki> because. you're processing data in serial right now
[14:12:08] <SgtPooki> you want it to go faster, right?
[14:12:27] <GingerGeek> It's not a big priority but I would like it to yeah
[14:12:35] <SgtPooki> if you want it to go faster, the only way without thoroughly analyzing your code is to parallelize your code.
[14:13:03] <SgtPooki> to make multiple ajax calls at a time instead of chaining each one behind the previous
[14:13:11] <GingerGeek> ohhh
[14:13:16] <SgtPooki> but your ajax call itself looks fine as it is
[14:13:21] <GingerGeek> But I don't think they are chained one behind the other
[14:13:33] <GingerGeek> I think it's just the browser limit
[14:13:36] <SgtPooki> if thy're waiting fr that success callback to fire then they are
[14:13:54] <GingerGeek> If what's waiting for the success callback?
[14:14:08] <SgtPooki>  if you're subsequent requests are waiting for the success callback
[14:14:10] <SgtPooki> *your
[14:14:15] <GingerGeek> Oh idk if they are tho
[14:14:20] <GingerGeek> because
[14:14:32] <GingerGeek> When I look at my browser network thing
[14:14:41] <GingerGeek> all of my requests are there
[14:14:48] <GingerGeek> it's just most of them are set as pending
[14:15:05] <SgtPooki> gotcha. ok, yea, then that's the best you've got besides some over-optimization
[14:15:37] <SgtPooki> other than rewriting the API so that you can make a network request for every 100 rows, or 50, or 25, or 10, or 5 rows.. instead of every single row
[14:15:49] <SgtPooki> so i dont think you can speed it up
[14:15:56] <GingerGeek> Yeah this is coming from a system where she manually types each name into the spreadsheet or something ridiculous - it should be good
[14:16:01] <SgtPooki> without doing stuff you've already said you dont really want to do
[14:16:09] <GingerGeek> yeah
[14:16:14] <GingerGeek> well thanks for all your help
[14:16:21] * GingerGeek offers plate of internet cookies
[14:16:27] <SgtPooki> hey
[14:16:30] <SgtPooki> actually
[14:16:35] <SgtPooki> your jquery("#log"
[14:16:38] <SgtPooki> thats a huge bottleneck
[14:16:41] <SgtPooki> you should cache that value
[14:16:51] <SgtPooki> var $logEl = jQuery('#log')
[14:16:53] <SgtPooki> then use that
[14:16:57] <SgtPooki> that will speedthings up a little.
[14:17:00] <GingerGeek> there's a reason my IDE yells at me for duplicate jquery selectors?
[14:17:03] <SgtPooki> probably quite a bit actually
[14:17:04] <GingerGeek> til
[14:17:17] <SgtPooki> yes. there is a reason
[14:17:18] <SgtPooki> haha
[14:17:54] <SgtPooki> also
[14:18:04] <SgtPooki> instead of append ('<p>'.. yadda yadda...
[14:18:11] <SgtPooki> cache that value
[14:19:05] <SgtPooki> var $p = jQuery('<p />'); then in your before, error, and success callbacks, do something like $logEl.append($p.clone().text('whatevr text'));
[14:19:43] <GingerGeek>  $p = jQuery('<p />'); why do I need to cache that??
[14:19:45] <SgtPooki> if you cache both of those elements outside of that ajax call, so that each one is no longer querying the database, or building dom elements from strings (very expensive..)
[14:19:52] <SgtPooki> then you will probably cut your time in half
[14:20:01] <GingerGeek> Why not jsut logvarrthingy.append("<p>sddfafd</P>");
[14:20:04] <SgtPooki> because building dom elements from strings with jquery is expensive
[14:20:10] <GingerGeek> kk
[14:20:15] <SgtPooki> let me get an article..

[14:21:08] <SgtPooki> The syntax for adding new elements to the page is easy, so it's tempting to forget that there's a huge performance cost for adding to the DOM repeatedly. If you're adding many elements to the same container, you'll want to concatenate all the HTML into a single string, and then append that string to the container instead of appending the elements one at a time. Use an array to gather all the pieces together, then join them into a 
[14:21:43] <SgtPooki> jquery even has a sample there.. they actually suggest building all the strings together and then appending that whole large string at the end.. but I don't think that would keep the same functionality you currently have
[14:22:18] <SgtPooki> ok, time to play in the snow with the little devil
[14:22:24] <GingerGeek> What's the difference between var pthing = and $pthing = and var $pthing =
[14:22:30] <GingerGeek> oh kk
[14:22:31] <GingerGeek> cya
[14:22:40] <SgtPooki> you always define new variables with var
[14:22:47] <SgtPooki> *should..
[14:22:53] <GingerGeek> oh good
[14:22:54] <GingerGeek> I do
[14:23:06] <SgtPooki> but var pthing = test; and var $pthing = test; are the same
[14:23:16] <SgtPooki> its convention to prepend var names with $ that are jquery objects
[14:23:25] <SgtPooki> or whatever other library.. (angular prepends many providers with $)
[14:23:38] <SgtPooki> k. now im out
[14:23:40] <SgtPooki> good luck!
[14:32:59] <GingerGeek> Thank SgtPooki :D you've been a great help

[14:34:37] <Omar-> is there a better way than using global variables?
[14:35:16] <Omar-> wrap functions in IIFE?
[17:49:38] <adv_> which comes first? 		$(document).ready(function() {
[17:49:38] <adv_>  or 		$(document).on("pagecreate", function (e) {
[17:49:38] <adv_>  ?
[17:51:07] <tandroid> I believe .ready adv_
[17:51:40] <tandroid> But not necessarily.
[17:54:47] <adv_> tandroid: depends on what?
[17:54:55] <ismarkup> hello, is it possible to have nested onclick eventsâ¦for example to handle what happens inside a modal? I have a modal with multiple buttonsâ¦etc
[17:55:36] <tandroid> Well, it fires after the dom is loaded normally or via ajax. So I would assume that if there is no ajax that it could fire at the same time.
[18:10:35] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/o3p8k574/ line3 works when the listview is hardcoded, but not when i do an ajax call to fill it with <li> elements. why ?
[18:11:15] <adv_> line 3-6, in the dynamic filling case, it doesn't print anything
[18:12:01] <adv_> errr nvm
[18:21:52] <bl4ckdu5t> I have this http://pastie.org/9990837 in the JS of this http://musterd8.herokuapp.com/preferences
[18:22:09] <bl4ckdu5t> I want to hide the element there but it fails
[18:23:00] <bl4ckdu5t> but when writing the name of the target element without the for-loop i.e [data-form="1"], it works
[18:28:14] <imacinto> bl4ckdu5t I recommend either throwing a breakpoint at the suspect line or console.log'ing your jQuery selector
[18:33:20] <bl4ckdu5t> ok imacinto
[18:36:04] <t4nk349> Hi I'm a total noob in an exploring computer science class. I don't yet know jQuery but would like to add typed.js to my project. Would any of you be willing to walk me through how to add it? Thanks
[18:37:40] <t4nk349> anyone there?
[18:41:22] <adv_> i get  Uncaught ReferenceError: e is not definedlibraryedit.php:174 (anonymous function)jquery-1.11.1.min.js:2 m.Callbacks.jjquery-1.11.1.min.js:2 m.Callbacks.k.fireWithjquery-1.11.1.min.js:4 xjquery-1.11.1.min.js:4 m.ajaxTransport.send.b
[18:53:01] <BillCriswell> adv_: It sounds like you might be trying to do somethign with an event that's not defined.
[18:53:15] <BillCriswell> adv_: What's on like number 174?
[18:57:27] <adv_> nvm
[19:01:35] <adv_> anyone knows if togetherjs needs both users to have the same url?
[19:26:13] <fkt> if i do a $.each(something, function(something, something) { var something = something; });   may i access the var something else where in the script?
[19:28:19] <rcyr> No, it's limited to the $.each
[19:28:38] <rcyr> Declare it before the $.each if you want it to be available after.
[19:28:48] <rcyr> (it being "something")
[19:29:17] <fkt> yeah.  hmm.  well it changes per iteration of the loop.  i'm creating roughly 400 arrays, each with a unique name
[19:29:24] <fkt> i guess i'll have to re-think this
[19:36:04] <fkt> rcyr: do for loops behave the same way?
[19:36:35] <rcyr> The only scope in JS is the function
[19:36:45] <rcyr> for loops don't create a new scope.
[19:36:51] <rcyr> (They're not functions)
[19:36:55] <fkt> nice, ok, great
[20:37:38] <lambdumb> what's the method for printing a variable from a json array into a certain part of a webpage?
[20:41:29] <lambdumb> (background information: i have a php file that's encoding variables into a json array and i'd like to print them using ajax and update them on an if statement)
[21:04:55] <ismarkup> anyone around? I have to update a table rowsâ¦but I do have the first rows which I canât replaceâ¦it serves as a table headerâ¦the thing isâ¦I am using right now this -> $('#usersListTable tr:last').after(data); but if I try to open the modal again..it obviously request the new data and instead of replacing the rows after the first rowâ¦it adds more rowsâ¦with the same content...
[21:05:08] <ismarkup> is there a better way to do this?
[21:05:10] <ismarkup> thanks
[21:27:03] <TeddyMurray> with $.ajax how can you mix file inputs with regular text inputs?
[21:29:01] <rcyr> TeddyMurray: You can't. XHR1 is for text.
[21:29:07] <rcyr> XHR2 supports files.
[21:29:25] <TeddyMurray> how do i use XHR2?
[21:29:57] <TeddyMurray> hmm, because i have a "token" to prevent cross site request forgery, that needs to be submitted to the page along with the image
[21:30:08] <TeddyMurray> so it needs to send a tiny string along with the image file
[21:30:58] <TeddyMurray> hmm, maybe if i put the token in the url
[21:35:15] <rcyr> With  xhr, you have full control, headers, fields... etc
[21:36:59] <bennyprofane> is there a way to tweak this code so that clicking on one image swaps both? http://jsfiddle.net/Lyfo9q8v/
[21:53:40] <latemus> I wrote a php page that pulls multiple rows aut of a database and returns it encoded in json. I'm using $.ajax{()} to post the url that .php page and get back data. I've done this in many projects before. But now I have this .php page returning _multiple_ json arrays, and i need jquery to iterate over them..
[21:55:13] <latemus> I guess my question is: will tho $.ajax{()} callback retreive thesoe multiple json objects? OR will I need to do something with a loop..
[22:01:26] <TeddyMurray> i use $.parseJSON and then a for loop (var i = 0; i < object.length; i++)
[22:10:03] <latemus> TeddyMurray: TAHNK YOU
[22:10:22] <latemus> :D
[22:11:31] <TeddyMurray> worked? np
[22:18:59] <latemus> TeddyMurray: Nah, not yet. My php script is returning json like this: ["1","256","10","1","2","3","1","d91c2561-e718-4e50-b606-6a4ff943"]["1","256","10","4","5","6","2","ef105d09-81e0-4f01-bdb4-fcbd262c"]
[22:19:22] <latemus> TeddyMurray: Does that look like correct for $.parseJSON to handle?
[22:28:42] <latemus> I'm not sure if I should have the php script return a single, nested json array comtaining all the data arrays
[22:28:55] <latemus> *containing
[23:39:00] <flexpaint> i need help with this https://github.com/danielstocks/jQuery-Collapse/
