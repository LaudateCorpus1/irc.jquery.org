[01:02:27] <SimpleName> how to transform $('form').serialize() to object
[01:02:34] <SimpleName> I need to post data with json
[02:25:31] <LeGorille> hey folks
[02:25:43] <LeGorille> anyone familiar with chosen ?
[02:33:28] <LeGorille> I have a chosen select that's dynamically populated from an ajax response, however based on results, I would like to add a class to the select
[02:34:42] <LeGorille> $("[name='modular']").addClass('invalid').trigger("liszt:updated");
[02:38:05] <Neo2> Hi
[02:38:13] <Neo2> I want create chat
[02:38:17] <LeGorille> hi Neo2
[02:38:41] <Neo2> I prepared domain http://american-chat.kselax.ru
[02:38:45] <Neo2> put there it
[02:39:08] <Neo2> LeGorille: how create chat? Do you know?
[02:39:24] <Neo2> LeGorille: it will big American chat
[02:39:37] <LeGorille> that's a broad question
[02:39:43] <LeGorille> what kind of chat ?
[02:39:55] <Neo2> LeGorille: big with rooms
[02:40:01] <Neo2> LeGorille: one room = one state
[02:40:53] <Neo2> LeGorille: there will 40 rooms and a few common room, one sex, one love relationship ...
[02:41:33] <Neo2> LeGorille: I want create big chat on 10 000 users, prepared subdomain, put chat there
[02:41:47] <undefined_bob> dont waste your time LeG, its senseless
[02:41:51] <Neo2> LeGorille: what I should use?
[02:42:06] <LeGorille> undefined_bob, :)
[02:42:20] <Neo2> undefined_bob: see I made server for chat yet http://american-chat.kselax.ru
[02:42:28] <Neo2> undefined_bob: soon run it :)
[02:42:46] <Neo2> jQuery not suited?
[02:42:57] <LeGorille> Neo2, why do you want to create yet another chat ?
[02:42:58] <Neo2> seems angula.js better?
[02:43:16] <Neo2> LeGorille: what does means another?
[02:43:34] <undefined_bob> did read all the stuff we suggested, neo? I think you didnt, so its senseless to give you more advices
[02:43:53] <Neo2> LeGorille: I saw in English net doesn't exist any normal chat, this is free niche
[02:44:18] <LeGorille> you are in a chat room
[02:44:26] <undefined_bob> lol
[02:44:27] <Neo2> LeGorille: but this is IRC
[02:44:35] <Neo2> LeGorille: I want web chat
[02:44:46] <Neo2> LeGorille: have you ever made it?
[02:44:53] <LeGorille> no
[02:45:08] <Neo2> LeGorille: yes, I thought it, but I will
[02:45:26] <Neo2> LeGorille: what use do you advise?
[02:45:34] <Neo2> socket.io?
[02:46:10] <Neo2> LeGorille: I read about node.js and socket.io, I don't know how put there captcha
[02:46:20] <Neo2> bot's will spam in my chat
[02:46:29] <Neo2> and need to create moderator account
[02:46:41] <Neo2> for ban bots
[02:47:04] <LeGorille> Neo2, nodejs , angular etc take time to learn, and a lot of time to master. So start somewhere
[02:47:56] <Neo2> LeGorille: how do you think it's decent idea? I've found some big USA or English chats for speak with natives and couldn't find. and Made inferences, need to do myself.
[02:48:10] <Neo2> LeGorille: no, I will fast do this
[02:48:38] <Neo2> LeGorille: I need fast this create today, don't have time stretch it for long time
[02:48:45] <LeGorille> lol
[02:49:03] <LeGorille> if you say so
[02:49:18] <Neo2> LeGorille: how long it learn? I want today do it
[02:49:38] <Neo2> LeGorille: month? a few months?
[02:50:05] <Neo2> LeGorille: and this chat will hold 10 000 users?
[02:50:26] <LeGorille> Neo2, how good are you with javascript
[02:50:30] <Neo2> LeGorille: node.js for realtime application.
[02:50:55] <Neo2> LeGorille: bad, I passed test and got 1 score from 5, but I good know jQuery, I got 2.6 score
[02:51:14] <Neo2> LeGorille: doesn't mater, I will use google
[02:51:23] <Neo2> LeGorille: I know javascript
[02:51:36] <LeGorille> well maybe start with the basics, have a good grasp on how javascript works
[02:51:55] <Neo2> LeGorille: oh, it's boring I know basics :)
[02:52:16] <LeGorille> how old are you ?
[02:52:19] <Neo2> LeGorille: I want do instantly chat
[02:52:30] <Neo2> LeGorille: enough
[02:52:31] <undefined_bob> not sure if I should cry or laugh
[02:52:48] <Neo2> undefined_bob: why?
[02:53:27] <Neo2> undefined_bob: I need examples of chat code
[02:54:14] <Neo2> LeGorille: have you ever made bot on node.js?
[02:54:23] <Neo2> bot for skype
[02:55:10] <LeGorille> Neo2, no I haven't
[02:55:50] <Neo2> LeGorille: I too, seems node.js suited for this, but I don't know how to do this
[02:56:33] <LeGorille> Neo2, then it's time for you to delve into nodejs
[02:56:53] <LeGorille> install it on you computer and start playing with it
[02:57:01] <Neo2> yes, I'm harry up :)
[02:57:28] <Neo2> LeGorille: I have already installed it, reading documentation now
[02:57:30] <LeGorille> you are not in a hurry, you are delusional. no offense
[02:57:48] <Neo2> :) )
[02:58:22] <LeGorille> good things take time my friend
[02:58:27] <LeGorille> learn to be patient
[02:58:43] <LeGorille> and be ready to walk the walk
[02:59:14] <Neo2> ok will try
[02:59:31] <Neo2> would be good find prepared chat...
[02:59:47] <LeGorille> good to hear that. it will pay in the end if you learn nodejs, or angular, or or
[03:00:16] <Neo2> LeGorille: really?
[03:00:45] <Neo2> LeGorille: yes, maybe I will able create chats for people, will learn it. but I read node.js use for create games
[03:01:13] <Neo2> LeGorille: it's real-time. many brows online games use it like server
[03:02:18] <LeGorille> ok my friend, my break is over. good luck to you
[03:02:22] <Neo2> LeGorille: I seem for node.js is future :)
[03:02:33] <Neo2> LeGorille: Thanks, you too
[03:02:42] <LeGorille> thanks
[03:02:46] <Neo2> :)
[03:06:47] <mad_moses> hi, installed jquery and jquery-ui with bower and would like to use datepicker. Which files do I need? How can I found out which dependencies it has? (I tried, core.js, widghet.js and datepicker.js but it is not working ...)
[03:33:56] <Cork> mad_moses: check in jquery-ui's download page it will check what you need
[04:16:25] <WhirledPress> Good morning. Could someone tell me what's wrong with this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/z600vnx6/
[04:16:59] <WhirledPress> It should simply append 25 divs to a div on the page. Super simple.
[04:18:07] <WhirledPress> Jeesh I am stupid. nvm
[04:22:12] <mad_moses> Cork: only keycode.js and datepicker.js but it is still not working :/ Any idea how to debug?
[04:23:36] <mad_moses> Cork: getting this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'keyCode' of undefined
[04:39:10] <Cork> mad_moses: you haven't loaded the jquery file that defines the keyCode object
[04:40:09] <Cork> mad_moses: the load order is important too
[04:40:32] <Cork> ui keycide depends on $.ui being defined
[04:40:39] <Cork> *keycode.js*
[05:11:58] <impliednude> momentjs for the last week of january causes it makes it say 1. Anyone have a fix for that?
[05:13:13] <WhirledPress> anybody know of a more responsive version of turn.js ?
[05:19:45] <impliednude> erm, last week of december*
[05:20:20] <Cork> impliednude: how new year week things work is different in different countries
[05:28:22] <impliednude> Cork> you mean timezones? Why should that matter based on the fact it calculates based on where the user uses the form
[05:28:31] <Cork> no not timezones
[05:28:42] <impliednude> january 31st is always the last day of the year
[05:29:02] <impliednude> erm december 31st
[05:29:03] <Cork> how the week number is calculated when it is split cross the year end is different in different countries
[05:29:39] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/echfrdaw/2/ - mind helping me?I am kinda new at this
[05:29:39] <Cork> some take "first week is the first week with jan 1 in it" some take "first week where more then 4 days is in the new year" and i thing there are more
[05:29:55] <impliednude> Well all I care about is for usa
[05:31:10] <Cork> check in the config section in the docs there might be something there
[05:37:26] <Cork> impliednude: it is controlled by doy in the week config in the locale used
[05:56:39] <impliednude> So what should I do?
[06:15:57] <Cork> impliednude: pick a locale where the woy value is the one you want
[06:17:02] <Cork> (or create your own)
[06:20:08] <Fleuv> Hello folks, working on a slider which loads each following slide via an ajax call. Unfortunately I'm unable to bind the listener "timeupdate" to a loaded video inside the slide. Please have a look: https://pastebin.com/Zu36rg6t
[06:26:10] <Fleuv> it seems like I can't bind any type of listener to the loaded slide.
[06:40:46] <hellyeah> how can we call $smt
[06:40:53] <hellyeah> ops
[06:41:03] <hellyeah> what is the naming convention of jquery ?
[06:41:04] <hellyeah> $smt
[06:46:06] <Cork> Fleuv: is the video inside .find('.slide:not(.bound)')?
[06:46:16] <impliednude> Cork> locale = en automatically.
[06:46:20] <Cork> Fleuv: also those events will be lost the next time the update fires
[06:46:32] <Cork> as you replace all of them
[06:46:49] <Cork> hellyeah: jquery doesn't really have a name convention
[06:47:14] <Cork> hellyeah: some users opt to use $ prefixing of variables holding jquery objects, but it is far from a convention
[06:48:37] <hellyeah> I see
[06:56:22] <Fleuv> yes Cork
[06:56:47] <Cork> Fleuv: the only other reason i can think of is the second comment then
[06:57:03] <Fleuv> Okay
[06:57:14] <Fleuv> let me try to make more sense of that
[06:57:42] <Fleuv> because the event wont be triggered if the video isn't playing
[07:05:28] <undefined_bob> would it be the better way to create those little + sign with jq instead of within the pseudo css class? I have trouble to center the sign at all and later it should change to a - after click or touch
[07:05:30] <undefined_bob> https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/KXjrEo
[07:15:08] <Fleuv> Hey Cork could you be a bit more specific, here i pasted all relevant code: https://pastebin.com/tr7rzYdu do you mean that the slide variable declared on line 27 will be lost with all its configuration after completion of the success function?
[07:16:25] <Cork> hmm actually i just see that i misread
[07:16:45] <Cork> Fleuv: so no you would have to create a jsfiddle showing the problem for me to be able to help more
[07:16:47] <Fleuv> ooh perhaps this is also useful information, console logs: animate: 0  + end: 0
[07:17:58] <Fleuv> I will try
[07:21:08] <impliednude> Cork> I wish I knew what you meant but locale is en and offset shows 420
[07:21:29] <Cork> impliednude: i just had a look in the github repo
[07:22:11] <Cork> ex. https://github.com/moment/moment/blob/develop/locale/en-gb.js#L61
[07:32:09] <impliednude> Cork> I don't get what that's supposed to mean in terms of helping me out
[07:32:11] <Fleuv> Cork, here you go the http://jsfiddle.net/Fleuv/eke30unn/
[07:32:27] <Cork> impliednude: uh, ok
[07:34:44] <Cork> Fleuv: console.log($('.slider .slide:not(.bound) video:first').length == 0)
[07:35:30] <Cork> not sure why though...
[07:37:05] <impliednude> Cork> btw, thanks for helping me ^_^
[07:38:06] <Cork> ah, it fails if the video file isn't loaded yet
[07:38:18] <Cork> that might be why you get the error
[07:38:28] <Cork> Fleuv: you might have to bind a load event on the video element
[07:42:21] <impliednude> Cork> so the problems basically https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42370087/moment-js-get-number-of-week-of-year
[07:42:46] <impliednude> Cork> however, it doesn't say how to fix it. That's my problem with this. I don't know how to fix it
[07:44:45] <impliednude> I am sure it's just a simple fix for someone who knows what they are doing. Pretty sure in most cases I have found a simple line change can fix. but I am too ignorant to know :(
[07:53:21] <impliednude> I looked up the wiki, and would think there would be a tutorial on how to fix this issue since I am pretty sure I am not the only person who has ever ran into this issue.
[07:53:32] <impliednude> Just no one is forthcoming with information to help a newb
[08:03:59] <Fleuv> Cork, isn't the video already loaded as soon as the ajax call returns successful?
[08:07:59] <Cork> no
[08:08:18] <Cork> it is loaded as the server requires it after it parses the html
[08:09:10] <Fleuv> hmm okay
[08:12:31] <WhirledPress> impliednude, what are you trying to accomplish? You want 53 weeks in the year or what?
[08:15:42] <impliednude> WhirledPress> I just want my calculations to not throw out an error because the last week of the year just so happens to be a long year this year.
[08:19:05] <Fleuv> Aah nice Cork I've got it wrapped the timeupdate listener inside a ready listener bound to the video
[08:22:57] <Cork> impliednude: what exactly is wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/a0v6fpoy/1/
[08:23:29] <Cork> 2017-12-31 is a sunday and sunday is the first day of the week and so it should be the first right?
[08:28:42] <WhirledPress> But that implies that the last day of the year is in the first week of the next year...
[08:29:03] <Cork> no it is the first week where the jan 1 exists
[08:29:14] <Cork> it is the default in moment
[08:29:34] <Cork> if you change locale to ex en-gb it will check for the week where jan 4 exists
[08:30:04] <Cork> (that is the github i linked to before)
[08:30:26] <WhirledPress> But it kind of feels like february 29 using this logic would be the first week of march.
[08:30:49] <WhirledPress> I think that's the confusion.
[08:30:51] <Cork> this is first week of year not month
[08:31:04] <Cork> it only triggers on year change
[08:32:04] <WhirledPress> So what possible use is it to have the last day of the year return 1 for week?
[08:32:28] <Cork> cause it isn't the last day of year that controls that
[08:32:38] <WhirledPress> I'm not arguing with you, I understand that it is setup that way...just not sure why it's userful
[08:33:08] <localh0st> WhirledPress: it depends on locale, in some countries Sunday is first day of week in others  it's Monday, eot
[08:33:19] <Cork> the british solution is to have the week be "the one with the most number of days from that year"
[08:33:27] <Cork> ya
[08:33:36] <Cork> and ya there monday is the first day of the week
[08:33:38] <WhirledPress> I understand that. totally. Just not sure what the practical use for that is
[08:33:50] <Cork> in the use sunday is, and the week with jan 1 is the first of the year
[08:34:00] <Cork> WhirledPress: to show the correct week?
[08:34:08] <Cork> else things will offset
[08:35:01] <WhirledPress> so if the first day of the week is Sunday, and Jan 1 falls on Saturday, Christmas is in the first week of the previous year?
[08:35:54] <Cork> WhirledPress: depending on the locale ya
[08:36:23] <Cork> though sunday is the first day of the week so it would actually offset it one week
[08:36:25] <Cork> so no :)
[08:37:06] <Cork> 27'th is the smallest date that could be in the first in us calender i think
[08:37:41] <Cork> 29'th is the smallest in many europe countries
[08:39:02] <Cork> but ya, when you start fiddling with calenders things becomes a mess
[08:39:12] <WhirledPress> https://www.epochconverter.com/weeks/2021
[08:39:30] <WhirledPress> 53 weeks that year, including 3 days in January, it look like
[08:40:27] <Cork> depends on what calender is used
[09:06:21] <AL13N_work> hey, i have a custom eventhandler on a bunch of elements with the same class, but now for one of those, i wish to override the event handler with a slightly different one; but both are executed, even if i return false;
[09:06:36] <AL13N_work> how can i handle this better?
[09:07:27] <WhirledPress> put your event handler on a parent element and check before you process the event?
[09:07:50] <Cork> or just delegate
[09:08:05] <WhirledPress> isn't that what I said...
[09:08:07] <WhirledPress> lol
[09:08:14] <Cork> $(parent).on('click', '.the-class', function() { /* same as what you do today */ })
[09:08:20] <Cork> WhirledPress: almost
[09:08:29] <Cork> except you don't need to check manually
[09:08:39] <AL13N_work> the parents are the same
[09:09:01] <WhirledPress> aha, but returning false on the individual element won't bubble up
[09:09:10] <Cork> yup
[09:09:14] <Cork> AL13N_work: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[09:09:20] <WhirledPress> Cork, you are so brilliant--I learn something new from you every day
[09:09:33] <AL13N_work> basically, it's a bunch of inputs of different types, and there is a custom handler for setting the width; but for checkbox, i wish to not execute it, but do a different calculation of width.
[09:09:43] <AL13N_work> but, they all have the same parent
[09:10:04] <Cork> though on second though preventing bubbling is normally a bad idea
[09:10:18] <Cork> cause then you say you know you won't ever need that event again
[09:10:47] <Cork> AL13N_work: why not just do $(parent).on('event
[09:10:48] <Cork> opps
[09:11:17] <Cork> AL13N_work: why not just do $(parent).on('event', 'input:not(:checkbox)', function() {}).on('event', 'input:checkbox', function() {}) ?
[09:12:02] <Cork> then you don't even have to process the checkbox in the handler where you want to resize the other ones
[09:12:04] <AL13N_work> right now i'm doing $(parent).on({ setCustomWidth: function () {}, ... other events ... }, "input.class")
[09:12:40] <Cork> ah, the ui extension
[09:12:49] <Cork> i rarely use that syntax
[09:12:55] <AL13N_work> and i tested with $(parent).on('setCustomWidth', 'input.class[type=checkbox]', function (){ something else; return false;}); but that didn't work
[09:13:12] <AL13N_work> the problem is that the input.class one is executed first
[09:13:32] <AL13N_work> the input.class[type=checkbox] one is the second one to execute
[09:13:56] <Cork> AL13N_work: so just do input.class:not([type="checkbox"]
[09:14:04] <Cork> or the :checkbox selector i gave you before
[09:14:13] <AL13N_work> well, yes, but this will get ugly fast, if i have more exceptions
[09:14:36] <Cork> you could add a class on the element for what type of resize you need
[09:14:42] <Cork> there isn't really many other options
[09:15:09] <AL13N_work> damn, i had hoped due to being more selective, that the more selective handler would be executed first
[09:15:23] <Cork> AL13N_work: event handlers doesn't work like that
[09:15:25] <AL13N_work> and then return false might just prevent the other
[09:15:28] <AL13N_work> myeah
[09:15:32] <Cork> they execute in bind order (and bubbling order)
[09:15:41] <AL13N_work> and there is no unbind way either?
[09:15:45] <Cork> and like i said you should avoid return false or stopPropagation()
[09:15:59] <Cork> AL13N_work: you can unbind the event handler sure, but then you will kill it for all elements
[09:16:09] <AL13N_work> ah yes
[09:16:15] <Cork> AL13N_work: when you delegate you bind one event handler, not one per element
[09:16:16] <AL13N_work> i guess i'll have to except it
[09:16:26] <AL13N_work> it makes sense
[09:17:32] <Cork> WhirledPress: also sorry, i missed the part of the question about overriding event handler so your answer was more correct then mine
[09:20:17] <AL13N_work> Cork: what about more exceptions: do i do:  input.class:not([type=x]):not([type=y])  ... etc?
[09:20:37] <AL13N_work> or should i do something like :not([type=x],[type=y]) ?
[09:20:44] <Cork> AL13N_work: ya, or input.class1.sizing-type1
[09:20:59] <Cork> i would prob go with the class solution if you end up with more complext typing
[09:21:34] <AL13N_work> ok, but with the :not; should i use the first or second form?
[09:21:51] <Cork> first
[09:30:23] <olorin> Hello, what is the advantage of $("foo").find("bar") over $("foo bar")?
[09:31:02] <olorin> My IDE advises me to use the former
[09:32:21] <olorin> It's only good when used with end() ?
[10:06:17] <Cork> olorin: very very little
[10:06:29] <Cork> olorin: if the first is an id it makes the search slightly faster
[10:06:50] <Cork> (as it can make a selector search only under that element instead of globally over the page)
[10:06:58] <Cork> but normally it doesn't matter much
[10:07:46] <Cork> and personally i hate .end() and all it's functionality
[10:41:13] <EugenA> how can I put click event only on not checked radio button?
[10:41:37] <taplar> :not(:checked)
[10:46:34] <EugenA> taplar: if I click on radio, nothing happens, because element is checked :-)
[10:47:03] <taplar> that selector only matches elements that are in that state when it is ran
[10:51:01] <EugenA> click on radio should make another div visible. I want to avoid it, if radio is already selected and div is hidden
[10:55:54] <taplar> make a fiddle?
[11:00:13] <olorin> Cork, ok got it but the find doc page has some examples with end(), thought it was it
[11:00:53] <taplar> you should try to avoid using end() when possible
[11:04:47] <localh0st> hmm, btw

[11:05:00] <localh0st> why is it always returning true?
[11:05:24] <taplar> clicking a radio always makes it true
[11:06:12] <localh0st> so probably that's what he's asking for
[11:06:45] <taplar> though: $(this).is(':checked')
[11:06:48] <taplar> don't do that, heh
[11:06:58] <taplar> this.checked <-- works just fine
[11:07:46] <localh0st> this.checked is returning the same on the click action
[11:08:23] <taplar> right, i'm saying there is no reason to wrap it in a jquery object and then perform the :checked filter against it, when checked is already a property on the element
[11:08:37] <taplar> it's major overkil
[11:17:49] <olorin> actually find.end().find() is pretty nifty, it lets me do different things for each batch of found items...
[11:18:06] <taplar> it's not nifty
[11:18:09] <taplar> it's hard to read
[11:18:26] <taplar> and readability is very important in logic that is shared between multiple people
[11:18:46] <taplar> and yourself, if you take your eyes off of it for a given period of time, and have to come back and figure out wtf you were doing
[11:19:11] <taplar> just because you can chain calls together endlessly doesn't mean you should
[11:20:27] <olorin> ok, let's say it is ONE use of find() compared to native selectors
[11:20:47] <olorin> or misuse :o
[11:20:52] <taplar> then why use end()?
[11:21:10] <taplar> $(selector).find(anotherSelector).doSomething(...).end()
[11:21:16] <taplar> no reason to do end there
[11:21:22] <olorin> I don't want to look under the first find() nodes
[11:24:33] <olorin> Also my IDE complains when I make two jquery selects over the same group, I don't want to store it in a temporary variable either
[11:24:49] <taplar> why not?
[11:24:55] <olorin> less state
[11:25:18] <taplar> *shrugs* your spagetti code man
[11:25:36] <olorin> <:o)
[11:30:37] <mdunbavan> Hey I need to figure an issue out. Trying to get ajax Post/get requests to work but keep getting this `[Deprecation] Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.`
[11:31:10] <taplar> yeah, don't do syncronous requests
[11:31:29] <mdunbavan> But I am setting it to false
[11:31:41] <taplar> that is trying to make it synchronous
[11:31:42] <taplar> don't do that
[11:32:04] <mdunbavan> even if I do this I still get it though
[11:32:30] <taplar> even if you do what?
[11:32:35] <mdunbavan> https://pastebin.com/D1skvdu5
[11:33:12] <taplar> i don't see anything with that logic that would cause that warning
[11:33:51] <mdunbavan> can I show you a full paste? It might take me a min or 2?
[11:33:56] <taplar> sure
[11:36:48] <mdunbavan> Here you go taplar https://pastebin.com/utmuHfTq
[11:37:43] <mdunbavan> So form gets sent via ajax, we create a callback that sends data to the getCart function and that gets html from the /cart page and inserts that into the cart div on the page
[11:37:43] <taplar> yeah, i still don't see anything that would do it
[11:37:59] <taplar> do you by chance have a $.ajaxSetup any where?
[11:38:06] <mdunbavan> no
[11:38:07] <taplar> or a beforeSend?
[11:38:27] <mdunbavan> no
[11:38:51] <mdunbavan>  send @ jquery.min.js:4 ajax @ jquery.min.js:4 r._evalUrl @ jquery.min.js:4 Ja @ jquery.min.js:3 append @ jquery.min.js:3 buildCart @ 68:740 cartUpdateCallback @ 68:746 (anonymous) @ 68:535 i @ jquery.min.js:2 fireWith @ jquery.min.js:2 A @ jquery.min.js:4 (anonymous) @ jquery.min.js:4
[11:38:51] <taplar> then as far as i can tell, your logic isn't causing that.
[11:39:05] <mdunbavan> ooops sorry pasted by accident
[11:39:44] <taplar> does the ShopifyAPI do any ajax stuff?
[11:39:58] <mdunbavan> no that needs removing its redundant
[11:40:21] <mdunbavan> Do you think its a script elsewhere?
[11:40:28] <taplar> i do
[11:40:48] <mdunbavan> possibly running on the /cart page when I get the html
[13:08:27] <cfaber> Hi, can someone give me some hints on how I can adjust CSS properties on hover, the difficult part is, I have a table of items which I want to adjust the opacity of 3 different div's within each cell, while only adjusting that cell's divs (which share a common id)
[13:09:52] <cfaber> so in my case, I have <td id=blah><div id=one></div><div id=two></div><div id=three></div></td><td id=blah>... and so on
[13:10:20] <cfaber> so I'd like to adjust the opacity when I hover over the cell, then have the opacity for the div's within that cell modified
[13:10:43] <Uhkis> and how is this a jquery question?
[13:11:08] <cfaber> I see that jquery has mousein mouseout? hover() functions to do this, and modifies css
[13:11:25] <cfaber> if it's not the correct tool for the job then I can use something else, I'm clearly no expert with this code =)
[13:11:45] <Uhkis> then you may want to head to  http://learn.jquery.com
[13:11:58] <cfaber> great, and since I don
[13:12:44] <Uhkis> (also, hovers can be handled by css alone)
[13:15:26] <cfaber_> connection problems..
[13:15:28] <cfaber_> .hover() appears to be what I'm after, and .css() to modify the value, but I don't know how to lock it to a specific cell
[13:16:05] <Uhkis> cfaber_: are you sure you can't do that with css alone?
[13:16:39] <cfaber_> I'm not sure
[13:17:16] <cfaber_> I can set #id:hover{} but that will only modify the vue when you hover that element
[13:17:31] <Uhkis> Paste code @ http://jsfiddle.net
[13:17:39] <cfaber_> one sec.
[13:25:18] <cfaber> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=eSbPHbC38H
[13:31:25] <cfaber> hopefully this stays connected
[13:31:57] <cfaber> so I was thinking .hover() to detect hover over the cell
[13:32:13] <cfaber> then multiple .css() modifications for opacity
[13:32:29] <cfaber> but I can't / don't know how, to specify that specific cell
[16:01:53] <SideFX> Anyone around?  I'm tyring to figure out how to get the .html() of the h2 object in this scenario: https://jsfiddle.net/bvkjppuf/
[16:02:22] <SideFX> I've done it with vanilla JS before, via sibling stuff, but I can't figure it out in jquery
[16:05:18] <shoky> SideFX: first you wanna close that <a> opening tag. then,  ideally you want to give the h2 a class, and do $(this).closest('.arb').find('.the_h2_class')
[16:05:46] <shoky> SideFX: $(this).next().next()  willl also work but is less robust and will fail as soon as you change your markup a bit
[17:23:49] <SideFX> shoky, thanks let me try that
[19:40:04] <Neo2> hey look at my site, I've made http://american-chat.kselax.ru:3000
[19:55:29] <jiffe> something about that url looks fishy, but I can't put my finger on it
[19:57:34] <SideFX> I have a div with id="whatever" loading in html from an ajax call.  When I try to do a $('#whatever').click() it's not working cause the id hasn't loaded yet, is there a way to deal with this?
[20:01:15] <SideFX> Oh I think I can put the code in the ajax call
[20:02:43] <SideFX> That worked.
[20:02:59] <SideFX> In case someone had the exact same problem as me at this particular time
[20:22:38] <jak2000> hi all
