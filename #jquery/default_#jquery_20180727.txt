[07:22:52] <Lucifer> I have a question regards cloning
[07:23:04] <Lucifer> winners.parents(4).clone() <-- why does this not work
[07:23:08] <Lucifer> however
[07:23:23] <Lucifer> winners.parent().parent().parent().parent().clone()
[07:23:24] <Lucifer> this works
[07:26:43] <pavonia> What is parents(4)?
[07:26:55] <Lucifer> the 4th parent of the winner element
[07:27:56] <pavonia> The documentation doesn't mention that this is allowed
[07:28:38] <Lucifer> I see
[07:28:42] <Lucifer> winners.parents(4).show()
[07:28:48] <Lucifer> however that did work
[07:28:56] <Lucifer> so it's just .clone() that is not allowed?
[07:30:32] <pavonia> I don't think that an int parameter macthes on the correct element, so it probably just works coincidentally in the .show() case. Why not parents().eq(4)?
[07:35:29] <Lucifer> that does not seem to work
[07:35:34] <Lucifer> because winners has many elements
[07:35:40] <Lucifer> var winners = THUMBNAILS.find(".tournament-winner:Contains(" + filter + ")");
[07:36:06] <Lucifer> parents(n) does work, except not for clone :(
[08:13:51] <khobo_> hello gents
[08:13:55] <khobo_> i need some help understanding some code
[08:13:57] <khobo_> https://jsfiddle.net/57vkuLfw/
[08:14:07] <khobo_> which part says that if it's bigger than 969
[08:14:09] <khobo_> the innerwidth
[10:24:08] <how2hack> hi, i need some help with a problem: i've got a .load() inside a function, and this function is being called from another function but it is not loading anything (i can't see the request but i can see the function is being called and it's executed with a console.log())
[10:24:25] <how2hack> anything wrong with the code? https://hastebin.com/rajixaxusa.js
[10:28:25] <taplar> the load() method will be skipped if the element it operates on is not found
[10:31:51] <how2hack> oh right, i completely missed that, i was moving all the code inside functions...
[10:32:32] <how2hack> one last thing, about the ajax async: false, is it ok if i use it?
[10:32:43] <taplar> you should avoid that
[10:32:58] <taplar> synchronous ajax requests lock up the browser, and create a terrible user experience
[10:33:05] <how2hack> that means i should rewrite my code so i don't need it?
[10:33:15] <taplar> i would highly recommend it
[10:33:35] <how2hack> can you recommend me something about line 75?
[10:33:51] <how2hack> currently i have no idea how to do this
[10:35:13] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/ goes into details about ajax, using callbacks, and most of the related stuff
[10:35:48] <how2hack> i guess i can figure that out
[10:36:36] <how2hack> but i'm not so sure about the function GetContent() the ifs ( name ... ), if i move those if inside .done() that's DRY
[10:37:23] <taplar> what do you mean?
[10:37:37] <how2hack> line 40 through 64
[10:37:57] <how2hack> to remove async: false i need to move those lines inside both .done()
[10:38:11] <how2hack> there is also line 75...
[10:38:40] <taplar> if you find yourself repeating logic, and are concerned with DRY (rightfully so), that's what functions are for, :)
[10:39:19] <how2hack> hmmm right, more functions :D
[10:58:09] <how2hack> my browser locks down linux entirely and the only tab open is my app, can this code cause a freeze that locks the entire system? https://hastebin.com/itoyusedec.js
[11:01:55] <taplar> i don't see anything that jumps out at me with your logic
[11:02:46] <how2hack> it can be other program though, but before forcing a restart a saw a message in firefox: this tab is slowing down the browser...
[11:04:04] <taplar> the tab slowing down the browser message could reference some bad logic or if you still have async: false in there some where
[11:06:06] <how2hack> async: false matters even if all request are for localhost?
[11:08:07] <shoky> yes
[11:08:15] <shoky> never ever use async: false
[11:09:05] <how2hack> ok i'm rewriting so i don't need it
[11:10:19] <taplar> shoky: still having spammer issues?
[11:11:07] <how2hack> hmm is it ok to use setTimeOut() in case i need to wait for the request? like 50-100ms? what's a safe ms value?
[11:11:27] <taplar> you should use the promises and callbacks provided
[11:12:02] <taplar> asynchronous requests are variable in their response time.  the callbacks allow you to attach logic to them to happen when they finish, regardless of how long that is
[11:12:03] <shoky> taplar: haven't noticed them today
[11:12:15] <khobo_> https://jsfiddle.net/Lc7sv1yr/5/
[11:12:22] <khobo_> okay having some issues with my hamburger full screen overlay
[11:12:25] <khobo_> when i move the browser width
[11:12:26] <taplar> that's good.  i still have pm's blocked just in case, :)
[11:12:26] <khobo_> it disappears
[11:12:33] <khobo_> i only want it to disappear if it hits larger than 969px
[11:12:37] <shoky> oh they pm'd too?
[11:12:37] <khobo_> can someone walk me through this?
[11:12:53] <taplar> they started pming yesterday
[11:13:03] <shoky> ew. guess i got lucky
[11:13:59] <taplar> khobo_:  larger than 969px?
[11:14:05] <khobo_> yeah
[11:14:08] <khobo_> when i switch  if (window.innerWidth >= 969) {
[11:14:12] <khobo_> > to <
[11:14:13] <khobo_> it works
[11:14:16] <khobo_> but then whe i go to full screen
[11:14:18] <taplar> :)
[11:14:20] <khobo_> it disappears the main nav
[11:14:33] <khobo_> like the one that's displayed when it's in desktop view
[11:15:09] <taplar> what's the width when you go full screen?
[11:15:21] <khobo_> 969 or greater
[11:15:34] <khobo_> the media response starts at line 161 in the CSS
[11:15:53] <taplar> but you said you wanted it to disappear if it's greater.  that's what your first if is doing
[11:16:06] <khobo_> yeah i want it to disappear when it's greater
[11:16:11] <khobo_> the problem is when it disappears
[11:16:31] <khobo_> it also hides the nav that should be displayed when at desktop mode
[11:16:42] <khobo_> wait
[11:16:46] <khobo_> refresh the window
[11:16:54] <khobo_> drag the preview as larger as you can
[11:16:57] <khobo_> adn see the nav on the left
[11:17:13] <taplar> i'm still on /5 .  what version are you on
[11:17:20] <khobo_> samesame
[11:17:26] <khobo_> one sec i'm uploading screen cap
[11:17:33] <khobo_> https://imgur.com/a/69j92v4
[11:17:36] <khobo_> okay larger than 969
[11:17:38] <khobo_> should display this
[11:17:42] <khobo_> nav on left
[11:17:45] <khobo_> watch this
[11:17:57] <taplar> you're on /15
[11:18:24] <khobo_> yeah i didnt change anything
[11:18:26] <khobo_> how'd youknow that tho?
[11:18:28] <khobo_> https://jsfiddle.net/Lc7sv1yr/15/
[11:18:31] <khobo_> this is where i'm at
[11:18:37] <taplar> right, look at that url
[11:18:54] <taplar> the end /# changes every time you update
[11:18:57] <khobo_> oh weird
[11:18:58] <khobo_> okay sorry
[11:18:59] <taplar> that's your version
[11:19:18] <khobo_> so like if i switch around the <'s it doesnt make it disappear now
[11:19:19] <khobo_> BUT
[11:19:28] <khobo_> if i click the hamburger and unclick it
[11:19:31] <khobo_> then scroll back out to full screen
[11:19:35] <khobo_> the nav on the left has now disappeared
[11:19:47] <khobo_> it shows the bar it shows my header but the link's are gone
[11:19:53] <khobo_> it's like it's appending it and not putting it back
[11:20:06] <taplar> line 17 is still doing <=
[11:20:14] <khobo_> yeah i changed it back to original
[11:20:21] <khobo_> that's why i was saying version 5 is samesame
[11:20:41] <khobo_> also if i remove everything except for the last two lines
[11:20:42] <taplar> but you said you wanted the menu to disappear if it was greater.  that logic is saying if it is less than, hide it
[11:20:45] <taplar> that's a contradiction
[11:21:03] <khobo_> https://jsfiddle.net/Lc7sv1yr/18/
[11:21:15] <khobo_> okay look at that
[11:21:21] <khobo_> make it full screen
[11:21:23] <khobo_> look at nav menu
[11:21:26] <khobo_> make it small
[11:21:29] <khobo_> hit hamburger close hamburger
[11:21:31] <khobo_> then go back to full screen
[11:21:38] <khobo_> see how the nav is gone now?
[11:21:52] <taplar> it's swapping back and forth as i resize between 960ish and less
[11:21:55] <khobo_> that's the problem
[11:22:02] <khobo_> what's swapping
[11:22:21] <taplar> you don't want that swapping to happen?
[11:22:31] <khobo_> i dont know what you mean by swapping
[11:22:33] <khobo_> wait hold on man
[11:22:40] <khobo_> https://imgur.com/a/69j92v4
[11:22:42] <khobo_> did you look at this?
[11:22:47] <khobo_> see the contents?
[11:22:49] <khobo_> on the left side
[11:23:02] <khobo_> when you click the hamburger and unclick
[11:23:03] <taplar> if i resize the window from 969 to 970 or so, it swaps from the mobile menu open, to just the sidebar
[11:23:09] <khobo_> that's what i want
[11:23:11] <khobo_> but dude
[11:23:13] <khobo_> the menu contents are gone
[11:23:18] <khobo_> after hitting hamburger open and close
[11:23:21] <khobo_> https://jsfiddle.net/Lc7sv1yr/19/
[11:23:22] <khobo_> this works perfectly
[11:23:24] <khobo_> except for that
[11:23:35] <WebDragon> have you looked how bootstrap4 does it?
[11:23:44] <WebDragon> s/looked how/looked at how/
[11:23:45] <khobo_> https://imgur.com/a/69j92v4
[11:23:46] <khobo_> it does this
[11:23:51] <khobo_> see how it's disappeared now?
[11:23:52] <taplar> oooh, i think i see what you're saying
[11:24:27] <khobo_> i dont even need the resize event listeners really
[11:24:34] <khobo_> i just need it to place the nav back
[11:24:38] <khobo_> on exit
[11:25:00] <taplar> closing the menu is putting a display none on that list
[11:25:09] <taplar> the nav-list
[11:25:31] <khobo_> riht but if i display that
[11:25:34] <khobo_> then the overlay is forever there
[11:25:41] <khobo_> i dont get wtf is happening
[11:25:48] <taplar> so here is what i would suggest
[11:26:04] <taplar> make a class that goes on the nav-list to show/hide it for mobile
[11:26:12] <taplar> effectively the display none for it
[11:26:22] <taplar> but -only- make that class defined for the media query you want for mobile
[11:27:06] <taplar> that way if you are in mobile, toggling that class will show/hide the menu
[11:27:20] <taplar> but if they resize to desktop, the rule doesn't exist and the menu will show regardless
[11:28:14] <khobo_> what i dont get is
[11:28:18] <khobo_> it's display none to begin with
[11:28:28] <khobo_> wait
[11:28:31] <khobo_> let me look at non response
[11:28:33] <khobo_> see what it says
[11:28:47] <khobo_> yeah it displays
[11:29:10] <taplar> if I refresh the page, the inline display none is not on the list
[11:29:14] <taplar> *the nav-list
[11:29:56] <taplar> actually there is a rule for #nav-list that has display none, so that's why it's not showing initially
[11:30:08] <taplar> but that's in a media query so it's conditional
[11:30:51] <khobo_> so basically i need to show it
[11:30:54] <khobo_> if it's larger than 969px
[11:31:13] <taplar> yep
[11:31:38] <khobo_> but i thought it would since the non query says displays as block
[11:31:46] <khobo_> maybe i havent set a display
[11:31:47] <khobo_> one sec
[11:32:22] <khobo_> that didnt fix it
[11:32:27] <khobo_> hmmmmmm
[11:32:34] <khobo_> maybe toggleclass on click would work?
[11:32:40] <khobo_> and adding a class that says display:block
[11:32:58] <khobo_> or a media response if window is larger than 969
[11:33:49] <khobo_> na
[11:38:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lc7sv1yr/25/
[11:38:20] <taplar> it's not sliding now, but it's not hiding on desktop
[11:38:30] <khobo_> yeah im still working on it too
[11:38:33] <khobo_> driving me nuts
[11:38:57] <khobo_> okay weird
[11:39:12] <khobo_> i wonder what's causing the slidedown to behave like that
[11:40:32] <taplar> what do you mean?
[11:40:48] <khobo_> like now that you took out the slidetoggle on nav-list
[11:40:49] <khobo_> it works
[11:40:52] <khobo_> why
[11:41:25] <taplar> slideToggle as part of it's "animation" is to set an inline style of display
[11:41:40] <taplar> when it hides it, it finishes by setting the display to none
[11:41:48] <taplar> inline
[11:41:48] <khobo_> ohhhhh
[11:41:58] <khobo_> couldnt you just add it back in
[11:42:03] <khobo_> after the slidetoggle
[11:42:06] <khobo_> with some kind of selector
[11:42:18] <taplar> the issue is that inline styles take precedence over 99% of all styles
[11:42:23] <taplar> they are the most granular
[11:42:32] <taplar> only rules with !important will override them
[11:43:13] <taplar> which is usually fine, but in your case, inline styles don't take mobile/desktop differences into consideration
[11:44:05] <taplar> what you could do though is to add a callback on that slideToggle
[11:44:14] <taplar> one sec
[11:47:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lc7sv1yr/33/
[11:48:48] <khobo_> IT WORKS
[11:49:02] <khobo_> omg!
[11:49:04] <taplar> so logically, if it is hidden because of the class, then you are fixing to animate it open.  So we take the class off, and put the display none back on it so the slideToggle will work
[11:49:25] <taplar> Then in the callback for slideToggle, if it is hidden, we add the class, and take off the display none, so desktop will still work
[11:49:48] <khobo_> all you added was nav-hide-mobile in the css right?
[11:49:51] <khobo_> dude...
[11:49:56] <khobo_> you have no many hours
[11:50:00] <khobo_> i've spent on this stupdi problem
[11:50:03] <khobo_> thank you thank you thank you
[11:50:04] <taplar> and changed the media query for the nav-list from display:none to display:block
[11:50:17] <taplar> and put the nav-hide-mobile class on the list by default, so it starts off closed
[11:51:22] <damsonn> Hey guys
[11:51:44] <taplar> bonjour
[11:51:57] <damsonn> Due to a weird site layout I didn't develop I have to run a jQuery function 10 times, basically for divs #id1 #id2 #id3 .... #id10
[11:52:07] <khobo_> okay one second
[11:52:11] <damsonn> Because on some pages these divs may be there, on others they may not
[11:52:21] <damsonn> I can't just use a common class
[11:52:40] <damsonn> Would it be terrible for pagespeed to do this
[11:52:53] <taplar> no?
[11:52:58] <damsonn> if(document.getElementById("id1") == null) {
[11:53:00] <damsonn> 10 times
[11:53:06] <damsonn> To prevent errors
[11:53:06] <taplar> oh, don't do that
[11:53:17] <damsonn> Ah, just run it without the ifs?
[11:53:27] <taplar> $('#id1, #id2, #id3, ...).each(...)
[11:54:31] <taplar> or for vanilla js, document.querySelectorAll('#id1, #id2, #id3, ....).forEach
[11:54:57] <taplar> though with vanilla i forget if you have to stick that in an Array.from() before you can use the forEach or not
[11:55:52] <damsonn> Hm
[11:56:04] <damsonn> I see what you mean taplar, but I'm not sure if it can be done in this scenario
[11:56:10] <damsonn> I'll try to go one level deeper
[11:57:06] <damsonn> I'm running jsplumb, it's supposed to connect #id1 with #id2 or whatever it is I specify
[11:57:19] <damsonn> I have no idea how to ingetrage $().each with its formatting
[11:57:34] <khobo_> *shakes taplar's hand furiously
[11:57:41] <khobo_> thank you man
[11:57:42] <khobo_> seriously
[11:58:03] <taplar> i'm not familiar with jsplumb. but just going off of the idea of selecting an element, checking if it exists before doing something with it, just selecting and using each works for that
[11:58:07] <taplar> khobo_: np man
[11:58:11] <damsonn> Here's what it looks like taplar http://jsfiddle.net/L25dyz17/1/
[11:58:38] <damsonn> What this code does is draws a SVG from every  div to the destination one
[11:59:20] <damsonn> I'm not sure if .each() can be used here
[11:59:23] <taplar> side note, you got a possible syntax error with the , at the end of your object definitions
[11:59:38] <taplar> but, what part of these objects are the keys you are trying to ensure are on the page?
[11:59:57] <damsonn> Ah, thanks for that
[12:00:28] <damsonn> Well, basically you see the ID names are the same, only the count is different
[12:00:47] <taplar> "id names" ?
[12:00:50] <damsonn> So you can have #ID1 connecting to #DIV1 to #ANOTHERDIV1
[12:01:23] <taplar> jsPlumb.connect({ source:"countfinal", target:"secondlast", connector: ["Bezier", { curviness: 30 }], anchor: "Continuous", });
[12:01:30] <damsonn> But on some pages it's only going to be 1's, on others 1's and 2's and 3s
[12:01:32] <taplar> that's what i'm seeing.  i don't see an explicit id?
[12:01:35] <damsonn> That's for a div that's on every page
[12:01:37] <damsonn> Oh
[12:01:42] <damsonn> Sorry, should've elaborated
[12:01:57] <damsonn> countfinal in jsplumb refers to a div #countfinal
[12:02:04] <damsonn> secondlast to #secondlast
[12:02:19] <taplar> gotcha.  figured it might be that, but needed to confirm
[12:02:20] <damsonn> mid1 to #mid1 and so on, these are basically div IDs
[12:02:30] <taplar> ok, so you only want to do them if the source and target exist
[12:02:34] <damsonn> Yep
[12:02:48] <damsonn> If* this wouldn't unnecessarily slow down the page
[12:03:07] <taplar> ok, i can think of at least one thing you could potentially do
[12:04:09] <damsonn> What do you suggest?
[12:04:30] <taplar> writing it out, one sec
[12:05:03] <damsonn> Ah, thanks!
[12:05:46] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/L25dyz17/6/  possibly something like that
[12:06:33] <taplar> you try and select the source and target.  if you find both of them, you do the method
[12:06:43] <taplar> otherwise it just skips it
[12:07:14] <taplar> and id lookups are super fast so it's not really a performance concern
[12:07:23] <taplar> brb, going to get food fast
[12:16:40] * taplar_lunch poorly beat boxes due to soup day
[12:23:11] <damsonn> thank you taplar
[12:23:21] <damsonn> I'm just looking at it, sorry, phone rang
[12:23:29] <taplar_lunch> it's cool
[12:24:25] <damsonn> I see you've commented out a part but I'd still need it for the code to work, yes?
[12:24:42] <damsonn> Since basically I still need to specify that mid1 should connect to end1 for jsplumb
[12:24:48] <taplar_lunch> yeah, i just changed it for one example
[12:25:44] <damsonn> Would this also work? http://jsfiddle.net/L25dyz17/9/
[12:26:25] <taplar_lunch> did you just add the second call to the method?
[12:27:02] <damsonn> I think so...
[12:27:26] <taplar_lunch> then yeah that should work, though fix the `,` on the end of the object
[12:27:56] <damsonn> Ah, perfect, thanks
[12:27:57] <damsonn> Will do
[12:28:02] <damsonn> I'll run it now
[16:33:17] <db_rando> hey taplar

[16:36:04] <db_rando> so the body receives a "blue" class once the first .key-details title is scrolled over...
[16:36:10] <db_rando> But once I reach the second one, nothing happens
[16:36:19] <db_rando> It's possible I need to run a foreach in this somehow
[16:36:30] <taplar> ok, so logically are you trying to see if any of them are visible?
[16:36:32] <db_rando> Because I suspect the code detects that one of these divs is invisible
[16:36:34] <db_rando> Yep
[16:36:39] <taplar> then you should do a filter
[16:36:43] <db_rando> If just one is visible, then do X
[16:36:51] <db_rando> Ah, I see, thank you
[16:37:17] <taplar> jQuery('.key-details-title').filter(function(){ return $(this).visible(true); }).length > 0
[16:37:40] <db_rando> so I should replace
[16:37:45] <db_rando> if(jQuery('.key-details-title').visible(true))
[16:37:47] <db_rando> with that?
[16:37:48] <taplar> yah
[16:38:21] <taplar> technically you could leave off the >0 since 0 is falsy and a selector can't be negative
[16:39:10] <db_rando> Thank you! Giving it a try
[16:41:41] <db_rando> Odd, I'm getting an unexpected token
[16:42:17] <taplar> hmm, what does it say?
[16:42:33] <db_rando> Unexpected token {
[16:42:53] <taplar> can you show me your if line?
[16:43:18] <db_rando> Ah
[16:43:24] <db_rando> :d
[16:43:26] <db_rando> One sec
[16:44:35] <db_rando> There was no if line, I'm dumb
[16:44:39] <db_rando> I've added it
[16:44:41] <taplar> :D
[16:46:24] <taplar> another small side note while i'm looking at it, with regards to: jQuery('body')
[16:46:39] <taplar> if you do jQuery(document.body) instead, jQuery doesn't have to do an actual lookup
[16:46:57] <db_rando> Ohh, I see
[16:47:30] <taplar> just a small thing.  if you already have a reference to an element, giving the element to jQuery, it will just create the object and put the element in it's stack
[16:48:35] <taplar> ignoring elements created with vanilla js, it's typically just useful for window and document.body
[16:48:45] <db_rando> For some reason it stopped working...
[16:48:46] <db_rando> Eugh
[16:48:59] <taplar> update that fiddle?
[16:51:08] <db_rando> Here it is
[16:51:09] <db_rando> http://jsfiddle.net/hk8u7f56/6/
[16:51:15] <db_rando> Even the old version won't work now...
[16:51:38] <db_rando> I must've removed something on accident
[16:51:53] <taplar> any console errors?
[16:52:11] <db_rando> I'm stupid!
[16:52:14] <db_rando> No, the wrong call
[16:52:26] <db_rando> I'm using the wrong plugin configuration
[16:54:21] <db_rando> yessss
[16:54:26] <db_rando> you are a genius
[16:54:30] <db_rando> It worked 1000%
[16:54:36] <taplar> awesome
[16:54:39] <db_rando> Just had to go through the obstacle of me pasting it in
[16:54:41] <db_rando> Thank you so much
[16:54:47] <taplar> np man
[16:55:03] <db_rando> I've been working on this site since 9AM and it's 11pm, you are a lifesaver
[16:55:08] <db_rando> BTW
[16:55:23] <db_rando> This website is running about a dozen of tiny scripts like the one I just showed you
[16:55:47] <db_rando> Do you reckon too much jQuery will slow it down? In actual weight, they're only about 150kb in total, I think
[16:57:08] <taplar> It's really more about what they are doing.  It's hard to give out general advice about what will slow down a page, imho.  Best I can say is FF and Chrome have developer tools that can test performance of your page and such, so you can get an idea of how it is working and what parts are relatively "heavy"
[16:58:56] <taplar> minimizing/uglifying/caching and gzipping resources can help with the file sizes
[16:59:16] <taplar> joining all the files into a single file can help reduce network latency
[16:59:30] <taplar> some of the basic things you can/should be doing/considering
[17:00:01] <db_rando> Hm, will definitely give all of that a try
[17:00:23] <taplar> brb
[17:00:27] <db_rando> Thank you
[17:18:08] <taplar> what kind of website is it?
[17:21:07] <db_rando> just something the clients' designer drew up. I usually do php and wordpress development but jquery isn't my strong suit
[17:21:27] <db_rando> This is extremely dependent on jquery to basically do half the interactions they asked for
[17:22:01] <db_rando> It's more of a flashy site to draw in attention to the company than a objectively usable one
[17:22:11] <taplar> mmmm, hate those
[17:22:20] <db_rando> I think they're looking at Awwwards for inspiration or something
[17:22:29] <db_rando> Well, I disagree with that type of structure for sure
[18:38:03] <khobo> hey taplar
[18:38:06] <khobo> u still around?
[18:38:18] <taplar> for 22 more minutes and then i'm gonna be like lightning
[18:38:30] <khobo> where u from btw?
[18:38:36] <taplar> arkansas
[18:38:39] <khobo> oh rightttt
[18:38:41] <khobo> we talked before
[18:38:55] <khobo> i rememberrr nowww
[18:39:10] <khobo> hmmm can i show you some code i made?
[18:39:15] <taplar> sure
[18:39:20] <khobo> okay i actually did this one
[18:39:21] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/ukpgw6r7/35/
[18:41:01] <taplar> that's cool.  how do i get it out of fullscreen?
[18:41:49] <khobo> riiiight
[18:41:50] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/ukpgw6r7/40/
[18:41:56] <khobo> check that one out
[18:42:00] <khobo> i'm trying to create a close function
[18:42:07] <khobo> along wiht using keyhandler
[18:42:09] <khobo> to bind the escape key
[18:42:19] <khobo> but am confused on the order and positioning of where that goes
[18:43:09] <khobo> can hit u up tomorrow if ur trying to get going
[18:43:45] <taplar> i'll be out for a few days, weekend and took a couple vaca days.
[18:43:55] <taplar> looks like you have a syntax error in that fiddle, one sec
[18:44:03] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ukpgw6r7/49/
[18:44:39] <taplar> so you're wanting to make it undo on Esc?
[18:45:03] <khobo> yeah
[18:45:04] <khobo> $(document).on('keydown', keyHandler);
[18:45:06] <khobo> right?
[18:45:21] <taplar> yeah
[18:45:36] <khobo> hmmmmmm
[18:45:52] <khobo> sick!
[18:45:53] <khobo> itworks
[18:45:54] <khobo> but nowwww
[18:46:10] <khobo> since i appended the div
[18:46:12] <khobo> into the new overlay box
[18:46:17] <khobo> it's removed when i escape out of it
[18:46:19] <khobo> how do i append it back?
[18:46:22] <khobo> or toggle the append i mean
[18:46:58] <taplar> since it's the first element of #project-slide-wrapper, you could select that element and prepend it to it
[18:47:21] <khobo> in the close function?
[18:47:24] <taplar> yeah
[18:47:40] <khobo> $("k_fullscreen_slide").prependTo("#slideshow-wrap");
[18:47:41] <khobo> ?
[18:47:54] <khobo> oh wait
[18:48:03] <taplar> sure, but you're missing the # on the first selector
[18:48:29] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/ukpgw6r7/62/
[18:48:30] <khobo> hmm doesnt work
[18:49:05] <taplar> you hid it, :)
[18:49:23] <taplar> oh, wait, no
[18:49:24] <khobo> wait
[18:49:30] <taplar> you moved #slideshow-wrap into that thing
[18:49:34] <taplar> that's what you need to move back
[18:49:37] <khobo> i took slideshow-wrap and appened it to #fullscreen_slide
[18:49:41] <taplar> :D
[18:49:51] <khobo> now
[18:50:01] <khobo> i need to take full screen slide and prepend it to #slideshow wrap
[18:50:02] <khobo> right?
[18:50:14] <taplar> so hold on
[18:50:20] <taplar> when you go full screen, what are you moving?
[18:50:36] <khobo> i'm taking #slideshow-wrap
[18:50:45] <khobo> and putting it into the modal window called #k_fullscreen_slide
[18:50:52] <taplar> and it's coming from?
[18:51:15] <khobo> from #project-slide-wrapper
[18:51:19] <taplar> so close is the reverse
[18:51:24] <khobo> right i tried to reverse it
[18:51:39] <taplar> so you take the slideshow-wrap and prepend it to the project-slide-wrapper
[18:51:39] <khobo> $("#k_fullscreen_slide").prependTo("#slideshow-wrap");
[18:51:40] <khobo> that's reversed
[18:51:43] <khobo> ohhhhh
[18:52:15] <khobo> fuck!
[18:52:16] <khobo> it works
[18:52:34] <khobo> mannn i would freakin love to know JS fluently
[18:52:39] <khobo> this is so powerful
[18:52:42] <taplar> :)
[18:52:42] <khobo> with web design
[18:53:55] <khobo> man thanks again
[18:54:01] <taplar> np
[18:54:38] <khobo> man im going to learn JS now
[18:54:41] <khobo> this excites me
[18:54:45] <khobo> i get like an adrenaline rush from it
[18:55:01] <taplar> :), wait til you start getting into it, and then you start playing around with like vue
[18:57:01] <taplar> in any regard, lots of things you can do
[18:59:08] <taplar> khobo: alright, i'm running out the door.  have a good weekend, :)
[20:53:30] <xp_prg> hi all, I am trying to figure out the name of a widget that lets you swipe your finger and cycles through choices with the velocity of the swipe of the finger
[20:53:35] <xp_prg> what is the name of that kind of widget?
[21:39:15] <andrelinoge> Is there a way to trigger the jQuery highlight effect on a div value change? (div value change being driven by PHP echo from API)
[21:43:29] <Woet> andrelinoge: isn't your code changing the div contents..?
[21:47:12] <andrelinoge> @woet, the php, can I embed jquery into php that's already embedded into a script tag?
[21:48:25] <andrelinoge> i think you just helped me figure it out, gonna go back to lab... thanks!
[21:48:48] <Woet> andrelinoge: seems like you need to learn a bit more about PHP and JS/jQuery
[21:49:01] <Woet> andrelinoge: but div values don't change magically, they must be triggered by you, which is when you'd trigger the effect
[21:49:06] <Woet> div contents *
[21:50:10] <andrelinoge> @woet haha i didn't do such a good job explaining
[21:51:28] <andrelinoge> I actually changed my code from php to using js websockets, i'm using doc.getelembyID innerhtml to write the node ws msg to an html div. would there be a way to have jquery trigger highlight on a price change from the node ws?
[21:52:23] <Woet> andrelinoge: yes, add the line of code that triggers it?
[21:52:37] <Woet> andrelinoge: also, why are you using getelementbyid / innerHTML when you're using jquery?
[21:53:28] <andrelinoge> as the for line of code that triggers it, pseudo code im thinking nest an if stmt once the ws data gets return to evaluate the last price then us js to change the css?
[21:53:53] <andrelinoge> second on using the getelementbyID, i guess I still have much to learn :)
[21:56:28] <Woet> andrelinoge: you're overcomplicating
[21:56:35] <Woet> andrelinoge: you have a line of code that changes the contents (using innerHTML)
[21:56:49] <Woet> andrelinoge: below that, add a line that triggers the highlight
[21:56:50] <Woet> andrelinoge: done.
[21:59:06] <andrelinoge> makes sense, i just need to figure out the conditional stmt  to have the text highlight green (if > than last price) or red ( if < last price)
