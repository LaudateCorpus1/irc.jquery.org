[00:26:31] <jquery999> hello
[00:52:51] <pavonia> Bonjour
[11:30:57] <CharlesPettis> Howdy
[12:18:41] <jquery694> hi there
[12:19:16] <jquery694> here's a question for you - how one could write a component library like vue/riot?
[16:08:41] <soda__hobart> hey all, I'm having some trouble getting the 'content' attr of a Bootstrap popover to take html.  I have 'html' set to true, and tags like <h1> are working, but trying to add some form <input> tags, for instance, do not work.
[16:10:02] <soda__hobart> https://pastebin.com/P7mdE7c9
[16:10:22] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle that shows the issue soda__hobart?
[16:12:47] <soda__hobart> robertmaxrees:  yeah, let me see if I can isolate the stuff I need
[16:30:31] <soda__hobart> well of course it's working in the fiddle, but not on my machine...   Does having role="tooltip" have anything to do with non-text-oriented HTML elements not working properly?
[16:32:14] <robertmaxrees> not sure.  i'd have to play with it.
[16:32:47] <robertmaxrees> though i'd question having an input within a tooltip.
[16:33:30] <soda__hobart> yeah, maybe i should just use a proper modal dialog?
[16:33:45] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're building so it's hard to make suggestions heh.
[16:35:41] <soda__hobart> I think my JS is not very modular, haha, it's hard to get it into this fiddle.  It's an application that batches some database searches together, and I need the user to be able to make small edits to a list of query strings, but I wanted this feature to be inobtrusive.
[16:40:23] <robertmaxrees> why not just inline editing?
[16:40:38] <robertmaxrees> like - click a button, it becomes an input, then a save row button or w/e?
[16:43:55] <soda__hobart> robertmaxrees:  Yeah, I think that would be more appropriate, but there also needs to be one of those option listbox things and I didn't want to clutter up the whole screen with elements that won't get used that often
[16:44:18] <robertmaxrees> "one of those option listbox things"?
[16:45:16] <soda__hobart> an <option> tag, haha.  I originally made the app with tkinter, they have weird names for stuff.
[16:46:18] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like really you just want inputs for all of this
[16:46:29] <soda__hobart> I guess bootstrap has several custom forms that have input/dropdown combined
[16:47:54] <robertmaxrees> *form inputs, yeah
[16:48:57] <soda__hobart> I think inputs would be the most simple--the select element really only needs to have about 3 options, so it's not very complicated, but just trying to figure out a way to make it fit together nicely...
[16:49:34] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have tabular data.  pretty easy to handle imo./
[16:53:27] <soda__hobart> the data isn't very troublesome, I just don't have much experience doing front-end design, so that's a bit of an adventure
[16:53:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[16:54:45] <soda__hobart> thanks for the help but it's quittin' time now.  I'm sure the solution will be obvious tomorrow
[16:54:53] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[16:54:59] <soda__hobart> later

[18:52:42] <Gh0st_Preacher> /nick robertmaxrees
[18:52:45] <Gh0st_Preacher> hahah awoops
[22:58:13] <elsheepo> So I got this contact.js file, which should validate and submit a form, pretty basic but I haven't used javascript/jQuery in a while, can anyone take a look at this? http://dpaste.com/2TZRKZW
[22:59:50] <elsheepo> lines 1-26 look like jQuery but its missing the initial '$'
[23:00:07] <elsheepo> handles the validation
[23:00:30] <elsheepo> I feel like the validation and the submission of the form should be handled in one clean function
[23:11:47] <robertmaxrees> the first 26 lines are just in an iife elsheepo
[23:13:11] <robertmaxrees> part of your issue is that $("#contactFormSubmit").addEventListener("click", sendMessage()); is running sendMessage() when doing the binding, not when the button is clicked.
[23:17:36] <elsheepo> okay
[23:17:58] <robertmaxrees> you want just sendMessage w/o the parens after it.
[23:18:08] <elsheepo> should I try a $("#submitContactForm").onClick
[23:18:21] <robertmaxrees> .onClick isn't a think :)
[23:18:29] <robertmaxrees> nor is .addEventListener on $()
[23:18:42] <robertmaxrees> $('#contactFormSubmit').on('click', sendMessage);
[23:18:44] <elsheepo> object.onclick = function(){myScript};
[23:18:45] <elsheepo> ?
[23:19:01] <robertmaxrees> so jquery objects and DOM objects don't have the same methods
[23:19:17] <robertmaxrees> addEventListener and onClick are native DOM - those don't exist on jQuery objects.
[23:19:29] <robertmaxrees> you want that .on() example i just showed you.
[23:19:42] <elsheepo> I just applied that
[23:19:54] <robertmaxrees> did it work?
[23:20:04] <elsheepo> yes but then page reloads
[23:20:09] <elsheepo> o_O
[23:20:29] <robertmaxrees> ah, so the second issue is you need to preventDefault on the event object.
[23:20:47] <robertmaxrees> so function sendMessage(e) { <- see that extra "e" there?
[23:20:56] <robertmaxrees> (that you're going to add to your code :) )
[23:21:34] <elsheepo> e.preventDefault();
[23:21:43] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[23:22:06] <elsheepo> bango :)
[23:22:09] <elsheepo> works
[23:22:11] <robertmaxrees> also: i might consider binding instead to the form's submit event, instead of the submit button's click evemt.
[23:22:21] <elsheepo> you know, I dont know why so many people hate on jquery these days
[23:22:30] <robertmaxrees> because it's largely unnecessary.
[23:22:37] <elsheepo> ooooo yeah that sounds good
[23:22:38] <robertmaxrees> depending on the project and codebase.
[23:23:09] <elsheepo> butttt
[23:23:21] <elsheepo> now the validation doesn't work
[23:23:33] <elsheepo> likes 1-27 are now inactive
[23:23:41] <robertmaxrees> well
[23:23:49] <robertmaxrees> why do you think that might be?
[23:24:11] <elsheepo> its in an on page load kinda thing?
[23:24:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[23:24:23] <elsheepo> lemmie look
[23:24:42] <elsheepo> ohhhh
[23:24:42] <robertmaxrees> the real issue is you're handling validation and ajax submit in two different places.
[23:24:46] <robertmaxrees> need to combine them.
[23:25:07] <elsheepo> yeah, thats what I was thinking
[23:28:49] <robertmaxrees> also mixing and matching native DOM with jQuery is kinda strange.
