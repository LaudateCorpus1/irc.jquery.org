[02:09:57] <Cork> SlizardWizard: your calling jQuery(this) where this is window
[02:10:06] <Cork> (line 2)
[04:09:55] <Gowtham_25> How to resolve this error while making ajax calls in jQuery ?
[04:09:57] <Gowtham_25> http://wetakepic.com/image/vZJK
[04:13:05] <Gowtham_25> does it has anything to do with cors ?
[04:16:05] <AdamPDotty> yep, my guess is you are supposed to use $.getScript()
[04:17:10] <Gowtham_25> I haven't used anything like that
[04:17:22] <Gowtham_25> I used only $.ajax
[04:21:17] <dunaeth> Hi, does one know if the jquery file upload is documented when it comes to validating / deleting uploaded files through a final form ? (ie. upload file trigger button is part of a common form and all of the selected files are added back to the form - as hidden fields for example - once they are uploaded)
[04:22:17] <Kartagis> Gowtham_25: if it doesn't have to be desktop, go mobile. mobile apps don't suffer from CORS
[04:26:06] <FLeiXiuS> What would be the selector for all elements that match observation[students_attributes][*][number]
[04:26:18] <FLeiXiuS> I'm not so sure how to perform wildcard searches
[04:32:17] <Gowtham_25> @Kartagis : I need to know how to resolve cors
[04:32:38] <Cork> FLeiXiuS: there isn't one
[04:32:49] <Cork> FLeiXiuS: you would have to loop and use regex
[04:32:53] <Gowtham_25> @Kartagis : And to be specific I need it in desktop only
[04:33:03] <FLeiXiuS> Cork, Thanks, I'll add a random class to the objects.
[04:33:19] <Cork> FLeiXiuS: exactly what i was about to suggest :)
[04:33:48] <Cork> FLeiXiuS: an alternative is to use the dom structure to find them
[04:34:35] <Gowtham_25> Use CORS to retrieve a php page
[04:34:45] <Gowtham_25> How can I do that ?
[04:35:27] <Cork> Gowtham_25: you have to configure the server to allow cross domain queries
[04:35:34] <Cork> it isn't something you can do client side
[04:36:05] <Gowtham_25> what do you mean by "configure the server" ?
[04:36:26] <Gowtham_25> My page is hosted in a site.
[04:36:44] <Gowtham_25> I don't know what server they use
[04:37:07] <Cork> Gowtham_25: if you make a request from one domain to another it is called cors (cross origin request)
[04:37:21] <Cork> Gowtham_25: this is by default blocked by browsers for security reasons
[04:37:52] <Cork> Gowtham_25: this can be loosened by the server setting a cors header allowing the specific other domain to access its resources
[04:38:03] <Cork> Gowtham_25: unless that is sent by the server the browser won't allow you
[04:38:19] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[04:46:41] <Gowtham_25> @Cork : Can I set that using .htaccess file ?
[04:46:57] <Cork> no you need to set a custom http header
[04:47:28] <Gowtham_25> How to do that ?
[04:47:29] <Cork> or rather you need to do it dynamically based on the request
[04:47:39] <Cork> else you open your site up to any request
[04:48:00] <Cork> its in the link i posted
[04:48:16] <Cork> you want to check the request Host header and make sure it is your domain
[04:48:25] <Cork> and then set the accept cors header
[04:52:51] <Gowtham_25> @Cork: Thanks a lot :-)
[04:57:21] <FLeiXiuS> When .change is called, is it possible to get the existing attribute?
[04:58:10] <AdamPDotty> getAttribute() or .attr()
[04:58:26] <AdamPDotty> so yes
[04:58:51] <AdamPDotty> You have to know the name though.
[04:59:06] <FLeiXiuS> So if I have a select box, I can get the old value of through the change event?
[04:59:14] <FLeiXiuS> Typically, $(this).val() is going to return the current val
[04:59:32] <AdamPDotty> You asked for attribute, not for value.
[04:59:37] <FLeiXiuS> ^
[04:59:42] <FLeiXiuS> You're right, my mistake.
[05:00:23] <AdamPDotty> I believe the property value is gone after change.
[05:00:44] <FLeiXiuS> Hrm .
[05:00:53] <Cork> FLeiXiuS: no you can't get the old value
[05:00:59] <Cork> you have to store that your self
[05:01:00] <AdamPDotty> You could manually save it with something like $(this).data('last') = oldValue;
[05:01:05] <Uhkis> just save the initial value and update it on change
[05:01:12] <Cork> AdamPDotty: that isn't how you store values with .data
[05:01:26] <Cork> $(this).data('last', $(this).val());
[05:01:28] <AdamPDotty> well, listen to Cork then :-)
[05:01:41] <AdamPDotty> oops, yes
[05:02:18] <AdamPDotty> brain still not working properly
[05:02:42] <FLeiXiuS> Now I'm confused.  This wouldnt be hanlded inside of the on change event?
[05:02:49] <AdamPDotty> yes it would
[05:02:55] <AdamPDotty> just you have to do it
[05:02:58] <Cork> FLeiXiuS: except for the initial value, ya
[05:03:19] <Cork> <select data-last="<initial value>">
[05:03:24] <FLeiXiuS> Cork, that's why I was confused.  So the initial value I'd have to load a data attribute.
[05:03:32] <Cork> yes
[05:03:55] <Cork> and the last thing you do in the change event is store the current value
[05:04:00] <FLeiXiuS> Right.
[05:04:04] <AdamPDotty> You can allways get the initial value with getAttribute(), but it might be less obvious code.
[05:05:13] <FLeiXiuS> What if I use click  rather a change?  That may be less to manage/overhead?
[05:05:22] <FLeiXiuS> Or maybe more  - depending on how its written
[05:05:23] <FLeiXiuS> lol
[05:05:31] <Cork> FLeiXiuS: that won't really help
[05:05:48] <Trioxin> I'm trying to find a plugin that will load more content as you scroll down the page like automatic vertical pagination. Is there some special name for what I'm talking about?
[05:06:11] <AdamPDotty> "infinite scroll" or something
[05:06:17] <FLeiXiuS> Cork, Alrighty, I'll give er a whilr.
[05:06:22] <FLeiXiuS> whirl *
[05:08:03] <Gowtham_25> What's a whirl
[05:08:18] <AdamPDotty> Sumtin you got in a good pool
[05:13:29] <FLeiXiuS> ^
[05:14:57] <Trioxin> this looks good http://jscroll.com/
[05:22:02] <FLeiXiuS> Thank you guys !
[05:26:18] <FLeiXiuS> From what I've gathered there's no easy way to sort the select drop downs is there?
[05:26:33] <FLeiXiuS> And by easy, I mean a *simple* one liner.
[05:28:42] <Cork> FLeiXiuS: sure there is
[05:30:26] <Cork> select.append(select.find('option').sort(function(a,b) { var at = $(a).text(), bt = $(b).text(); if(at < bt) { return -1; } else if(at > bt) { return 1 } return 0 }))
[05:38:30] <FLeiXiuS> cork :-)
[06:02:24] <Gowtham_25> @Cork I can't edit htaccess file in my hosting site
[06:02:38] <Gowtham_25> Is there any other way to do CORS
[06:02:42] <Cork> Gowtham_25: you can solve it in php too
[06:02:53] <Cork> you have to set a http header on the request
[06:02:56] <Cork> how do you it doesn't matter
[06:04:07] <Gowtham_25> @Cork If I set those headers in PHP then my browser wouldn't be refusing that ?
[06:04:16] <Cork> Gowtham_25: nope
[06:04:53] <Cork> but note you have to set the headers before you start echo content
[06:04:56] <Cork> or php won't let you
[06:05:34] <Gowtham_25> So instead of directly requesting the page I need to request for php and then it in turn set the headers and request for the page
[06:05:43] <Gowtham_25> Am I right ?
[06:05:48] <Cork> no
[06:06:04] <Cork> Gowtham_25: you can proxy the request over your server
[06:06:13] <Cork> or THAT server has to set the cors response
[06:06:25] <Cork> you can't from domain1 set cors for domain2
[06:06:36] <Cork> only domain2 can do that
[06:06:48] <Gowtham_25> I'm confused
[06:07:03] <Cork> two options:
[06:07:21] <Cork> 1. js sends the request to your server, (same domain as the page)
[06:07:36] <Cork> your server then makes a http call in php to the other domain
[06:07:54] <Cork> you won't be able to use cookies as it would be one cookie for all users though
[06:08:29] <Cork> or 2. the other server sets a cors header for the request, allowing your domain to send requests _TO IT_
[06:09:04] <Cork> if domain1 could set the "allow me to communicate with domain2" the block would be useless
[06:10:10] <Gowtham_25> @Cork Can you visit this page "http://gowtham.rf.gd/test.html" and click Get page button.
[06:10:28] <Gowtham_25> @Cork Pls do it in Chrome for debugging it
[06:11:31] <Cork> ...
[06:11:49] <Cork> you've obfuscated the entire page??
[06:12:04] <Gowtham_25> @Cork I'm sorry what ?
[06:12:19] <Cork> the entire page is eas encrypted (in js...)
[06:13:00] <Gowtham_25> @Cork Is it wrong ?
[06:13:05] <Cork> ...
[06:13:06] <Cork> YES
[06:13:23] <Cork> anyway have fun
[06:13:26] <Gowtham_25> @Cork Ok. How to resolve it ?
[06:13:32] <Cork> i donno
[06:13:39] <Cork> i don't know what the page does, as i can't read it
[06:14:05] <Gowtham_25> @Cork It needs to fetch google.com page
[06:14:21] <Gowtham_25> @Cork But it can't through ajax call
[06:14:31] <Cork> ya, you will have to proxy the call to your server
[06:14:38] <Cork> and make the call from your server to google
[06:15:11] <Gowtham_25> @Cork And how exactly can I do that ?
[06:15:30] <Cork> http://php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php for example
[06:15:45] <Cork> not really related to this channel, as it is server code
[06:16:36] <Gowtham_25> @Cork I thought I can in someway tackle it in client side itself.
[06:16:45] <Cork> Gowtham_25: you can't
[06:16:57] <Cork> unless you can get google to allow you to do cors to there servers
[06:17:40] <Gowtham_25> @Cork How that's possible ?
[06:17:56] <Cork> try admin@googe.com (don't bet on it though)
[06:18:16] <Cork> and yes, i'm slightly sarcastic here...
[06:19:13] <Gowtham_25> @Cork Do all other websites which make cross origin request follow the same ?
[06:19:24] <Cork> follow what?
[06:19:58] <Gowtham_25> Same procedure like proxying or using headers in htaccess file ?
[06:20:11] <Cork> well no
[06:20:20] <Cork> normally you use a public api the server provides
[06:20:30] <Cork> and those either use jsonp or have cors headers set
[06:20:58] <Gowtham_25> You mean like yql api by yahoo
[06:21:03] <Cork> (also not that proxying risks getting you banned from the target servers as all requests will come from one ip)
[06:21:13] <Cork> for example ya
[06:21:22] <Cork> not==note
[06:22:37] <Gowtham_25> I must first check  whether that call is supported in the php used in that server
[06:30:03] <dandangsy> Can anyone help please? I am trying to add() elements to a jQuery object but in doing so, they are reordered within the object to their original order (order of appearance in the DOM) rather than being appended to the object. Can anyone advise how I can have them appended please?
[06:33:46] <Gowtham_25> @Cork It worked
[06:33:57] <Gowtham_25> @Cork Thanks a lot
[06:34:22] <fuchstronaut> dandangsy: maybe you could just use an array instead?
[08:00:45] <Kartagis> http://codepen.io/kartagis/pen/GqWvRx why isn't line #14 in js pane working here?
[08:06:36] <taplar> post_title?
[08:07:29] <taplar> oh
[08:07:38] <taplar> your trying to bind outside of the ajax call it looks like
[08:07:57] <taplar> you either need to do it in the success, or better approach would be to make it a delegate
[08:08:33] <taplar> $('.posts').on('click', 'div.post_title > h2', function() {
[08:09:20] <taplar> also fyi, you should generate all those elements and append them all at once to $('.posts') to avoid the multiple page redraws
[08:23:10] <Cork> well not redraws but reflows
[08:23:25] <Cork> (the browser calculating how big the elements in the page are)
[08:24:15] <Cork> drawing happens a lot and is fairly cheap, reflow is very expensive
[08:25:38] <taplar> ah, i dunno i'm familiar with the difference
[08:26:25] <taplar> i suppose reflow involves reevaluating the stylesheets?
[08:26:58] <Cork> no it involves walking the dom tree calculating the size of each element (and how that moves the other elements)
[08:27:11] <taplar> gotcha
[08:27:12] <Cork> and in some cases like floats recalculate other elements as those move
[08:27:19] <Cork> and so on
[08:27:27] <Cork> that is why it is expensive
[08:42:51] <evhTap> Hey
[08:50:23] <taplar> hola
[09:48:28] <maasha> How can I replace text in a <p><span></span>text-to-replace<span></span></p> without loosing the spans?
[09:49:18] <maasha> $('p').text('new text') is too brutal
[09:51:57] <Cork> maasha: you can't
[09:52:12] <Cork> well you can drop down to nodes and loop over all the nodes looking for the text nodes
[09:52:25] <Cork> but the better solution is to wrap that text is an extra element
[09:53:04] <maasha> Cork sigh :o) it is a construct made the jquery-ui way.
[09:53:25] <maasha> accordion headers ...
[09:53:42] <maasha> the icons are added as spans inside the header
[09:53:49] <maasha> now I need to update the header
[09:54:14] <maasha> so how could I loop over the elements?
[09:54:49] <Cork> the best option is prob to just replace the full set of elements
[09:54:52] <maasha> .html().each ?
[09:54:55] <Cork> no
[09:55:00] <Cork> you can't use jquery
[09:55:07] <Cork> it uses elements not nodes
[09:55:16] <maasha> ok
[09:55:35] <Cork> you need to use https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker
[09:55:58] <Cork> (so ya, i recommend just replacing the entire content)
[09:58:41] <maasha> hm, what is the simplest way to replace the content?
[10:01:23] <taplar> put a span around it, :P
[10:01:27] <Cork> maasha: .html('<span></span>new-content<span></span>')
[10:01:31] <taplar> or that
[10:01:48] <maasha> ok, I have somthing working. Thanks
[10:02:06] <Cork> maasha: or ya, make your headers <h1><span class="content">text</span></h1>
[10:02:20] <Cork> then you can just replace the content even after jquery ui has modified it
[10:02:33] <Cork> (i would prob recommend the later solution)
[10:02:53] <Cork> taplar: good idea there
[10:10:03] <taplar> i'm only allowed one a day.  enjoy
[10:11:59] <Cork> lol
[10:12:42] <pleb_> how would i go about increasing the space in between these two buttons?
[10:12:49] <pleb_> <fieldset class="ui-grid-a"> 					<div class="ui-block-a"><a href="#mainPage" type="button" id="cancelKey" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all">Cancel</a></div> 					<div class="ui-block-b"><a href="#" type="submit" id="keySubmit" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all">OK</a></div>                 </fieldset>
[10:12:56] <Cork> pleb_: make a jsfiddle
[10:13:00] <pleb_> ooops that didn't work very well
[10:16:49] <NoiseEee> pleb_: "increasing space" = CSS
[10:17:39] <wpkeg> is there a simple css snippet that styles a jquery dialog barebone? so i don't have to dig through all the CSS or override stuff, etc.
[10:17:39] <wpkeg> heh
[10:18:28] <wpkeg> the css looks pretty small, but i think a lot of hte jquery UI elements are being used here
[10:18:49] <Cork> wpkeg: just copy the core css
[10:19:02] <Cork> wpkeg: ui has the css split up for functional and styling css
[10:19:48] <wpkeg> hm
[10:19:53] <wpkeg> so i was overthinking it the whole time, eh?
[10:20:13] <Cork> ya
[10:20:15] <Cork> :)
[10:20:16] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/download/
[10:20:28] <Cork> you need the first two
[10:20:32] <Cork> (groups)
[10:25:10] <wpkeg> is there a way to create my custom dialog titlebar?
[10:25:20] <wpkeg> or do i need to hide it and then create the bar inside the dialog itself?
[10:25:21] <Cork> what do you mean?
[10:25:37] <wpkeg> i want to basically not only restyle the titlebar, but add my own custom icons next to the X
[10:25:39] <Cork> you can style the one jquery ui makes
[10:26:00] <Cork> wpkeg: just use the .dialog('widget') and inject the extra elements
[10:26:09] <wpkeg> interesting hm
[10:26:14] <wpkeg> can i rewrite the whoel div? heh
[10:26:16] <wpkeg> :P
[10:26:26] <Cork> you can, but it will cause you much more problems
[10:26:37] <Cork> cause then you will have to constantly fight the plugin
[10:27:04] <Cork> (i extended the jquery ui A LOT a few years ago)
[10:27:21] <Cork> created a web based os with jquery ui dialog :)
[10:27:50] <wpkeg> i think it'll be easier to hide the titlebar with css (unless i can remove it a diff way) and then just add my own DIV in the dialog content that has my own titlebar?
[10:27:58] <wpkeg> this way i just need to make my sure my X closes the dialog heh
[10:28:24] <Cork> wpkeg: except then the built in hooks for managing the dialog won't work
[10:28:34] <wpkeg> how so?
[10:28:43] <wpkeg> if i trigger the X to destroy the dialog
[10:28:48] <wpkeg> (my new X)
[10:28:48] <Cork> the close button calls the built in hooks for destroying the dialog
[10:28:57] <Cork> and it calls extra hooks and so on
[10:29:06] <Cork> those things would break if you don't use that x button
[10:29:17] <wpkeg> so then why is there a method to destroy a dialog ?
[10:29:23] <wpkeg> is firing that not the same thing as hitting the X?
[10:29:29] <Cork> if you want to destroy it separately
[10:29:31] <Cork> no
[10:29:37] <wpkeg> well
[10:29:46] <wpkeg> since it's hidden with css, my X could just trigger a click on the actual X :P
[10:29:52] <Cork> ...
[10:29:55] <wpkeg> unless that doesn't work? haha
[10:30:06] <Cork> why not just extend the dialog instead of hacking around it?
[10:30:12] <wpkeg> touche
[10:30:28] <wpkeg> ill have to read up on extending it haha. lemme go take a look
[10:30:43] <Cork> it's really simple
[10:30:53] <Cork> give me a min i'll wip up an example
[10:31:10] <wpkeg> oh
[10:31:10] <wpkeg> ok
[10:31:25] <wpkeg> hmmm. kinda excited to see what you got haha.
[10:31:49] <wpkeg> i always thought the jquery ui was a complex thing. the more i dig into it, it's not really
[10:32:03] <Cork> ya, its quite well built
[10:37:53] <Cork> wpkeg: https://jsfiddle.net/rvqtwq9x/
[10:38:02] <Cork> simplest possible wip but you should get the idea
[10:38:27] <Cork> you could do this by creating a separate widget factory and inherit dialog if you want to go fancy
[10:38:30] <Cork> but both works
[10:38:44] <Cork> the styling is off cause i didn't write any css for it but ya...
[10:39:53] <no_maam> Hi
[10:40:23] <no_maam> I have written some kind of "service status indicator" using jquery, socket.io and a backend in python
[10:40:43] <no_maam> now I would like to allow other people to embed that into a website
[10:41:04] <no_maam> What is the best way of doing this in a kind of modular and secure way?
[10:41:25] <Cork> no_maam: either just give them a lib and a list of dependencies
[10:41:30] <no_maam> I think I could just run a website that does everything internally and have it embedded with an iframe
[10:41:36] <Cork> or give them a iframe link and have them put it in the page
[10:41:43] <no_maam> then my code cannot harm the original website in any way
[10:41:54] <Cork> ya, i would prob go both ways
[10:41:59] <Cork> providing both options
[10:42:07] <no_maam> alternative have some code hosted on my webserver and have it included with a <script> tag
[10:42:12] <Cork> (personally i prefer to avoid iframes as much as possible)
[10:42:45] <no_maam> is there anything in between that still provides some security?
[10:42:53] <Cork> not yet
[10:43:12] <Cork> they are specing custom widgets, but it isn't even in rc yet
[10:43:20] <wpkeg> Cork, hang on sorry i have your link tho ;)
[10:43:21] <Cork> (this is in browsers not jquery
[10:45:11] <no_maam> well, related to that, I love the idea of socket.io
[10:45:28] <Cork> don't really see the point
[10:45:30] <no_maam> just have a javascript library that does all the networking stuff, and use the best technology available in browser and server
[10:45:35] <Cork> websocket is easy enough to use directly
[10:45:41] <no_maam> sure, when it's available
[10:45:55] <Cork> unless you need to support ie <9 it is
[10:46:10] <Cork> so that isn't really a problem anymore
[10:46:39] <no_maam> so I wonder whether there is something for widgets in javascript or html
[10:47:03] <Cork> like i said, there is, just not standardized yet
[10:48:11] <no_maam> thanks
[10:48:39] <no_maam> another question, I sometimes have to write something like a dashboard or an admin panel for internal use
[10:49:13] <no_maam> so an app that basically just queries a database and allows editing to some degree, and it will be used only internally and doesn't need to look fancy
[10:49:37] <no_maam> is there something like a framework that make it easy to create such apps and have already predefined widgets?
[10:49:58] <no_maam> similar to the GUI libraries on operating systems such as QT, GTK...
[10:50:05] <Cork> ya, there are
[10:50:06] <Cork> plenty
[10:50:34] <Cork> extjs, yui a few written in jquery
[10:50:41] <Cork> just google around you should find a lot
[10:53:46] <Cork> no_maam: about the widget solution i talked about https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/
[10:53:52] <Cork> that is the draft
[11:04:50] <Illum1n4t1> cochitos
[11:04:51] <Illum1n4t1> :D
[11:08:27] <wpkeg> Cork, hmm
[11:08:42] <DarsVaeda> can you as for 3rd party here too?
[11:08:56] <wpkeg> Cork, .dialog('widget') -- does that just select the current dialog?
[11:12:30] <notchris> How can I select a localStorage value by partial match?
[11:12:43] <notchris> localStorage.getItem('edits-*');
[11:12:45] <notchris> in ex
[11:12:53] <taplar> not sure you can
[11:14:11] <taplar> getItem only takes a string input
[11:19:33] <no_maam> Cork: thanks
[11:33:56] <notchris> sigh
[11:37:46] <groundup> I have some modals that are the same for numerous pages but what they do on each page changes. For instance, "add job" can be called on every screen but I want it to update different elements depending on the page. So, I was thinking about just having a basic "addJobEvent()" and then registering events. What's the best way to go about implementing a pub/sub model?
[11:44:26] <robertmaxrees> groundup why not just give those elements a shared class and bind a single listener on the document?
[11:46:43] <groundup> It seems odd to use the DOM just to hold a listener
[11:47:00] <robertmaxrees> thuh?
[11:47:01] <robertmaxrees> *huh?
[11:47:02] <groundup> I was thinking that each page would have an inline script that would register the listeners
[11:47:07] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[11:47:12] <robertmaxrees> let the events bubble.
[11:47:15] <robertmaxrees> make your life easier.
[11:47:21] <groundup> Please, tell me how :)
[11:47:44] <groundup> If you tell me that you're going to babysit, I'll give you a kiss (virtually)
[11:47:50] <robertmaxrees> uh
[11:48:02] <robertmaxrees> no need for that?  what do you need to know?
[11:48:09] <groundup> LOL
[11:48:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[11:50:56] <taplar> you'll give him a rock band?
[11:51:39] <groundup> Okay, so... modals. There's a couple of them that do different things. There's a create job modal, an add driver modal, and so on. Let's say I'm on one dashboard which shows all of the drivers. If you click "add driver" I want it to show there. If you are on another dashboard that shows drivers with jobs, I want it to show the driver there. I figure, instead of replicating or doing 'if element exists, add element' it would just broadc
[11:51:45] <robertmaxrees> heh that cut off.
[11:52:17] <robertmaxrees> but from what i'm seeing you're conflating things a little.
[11:52:32] <groundup> I just stopped it there ;)
[11:52:47] <robertmaxrees> so you're talking about "broadcasting" events.
[11:52:51] <groundup> I am interested to know a best practice for this
[11:53:07] <robertmaxrees> use native DOM events and a single delegated listener to launch your modal.
[11:53:39] <groundup> That's done already
[11:54:03] <robertmaxrees> then what's the question?
[11:54:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:54:16] <groundup> Ah, okay, I'm missing that part ;)
[11:54:26] <robertmaxrees> it cut off at "it would just broadc"
[11:54:35] <groundup> Oh
[11:54:57] <robertmaxrees> mind, like, pairing that down into a sentence or two? :)
[11:56:09] <groundup> So, after the form has been submitted and the server-side returns OK, the front-end should add a new driver element or whatever the page wants
[11:57:32] <robertmaxrees> do you need any data the server returns to do that?
[11:58:05] <groundup> Yeah
[11:58:12] <robertmaxrees> then there's your answer.
[11:58:16] <groundup> ?
[11:58:22] <robertmaxrees> use a .then() to write in whatever you need to the apge.
[11:59:07] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:00:07] <groundup> That's tightly coupling the return of form to the event
[12:00:53] <groundup> I would need them in the same code location for that to work. I don't want that. I want to share the modals across pages and then have each page know what to do with the result of the form submittal
[12:01:42] <groundup> So, the modal and the form would be in script.js and then each page would say "oh, you submitted a form named 'add-driver'? I know what to do with those results"
[12:02:25] <groundup> It's a pub/sub model. Just wondering best practices for doing it in JS and since I'm using jQ, if there is anything for that in there
[12:02:37] <robertmaxrees> back.
[12:02:48] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about why you're so stuck on using a pub/sub here.
[12:07:53] <taplar> i'm not sure the jQ pub/sub shares across pages
[12:07:59] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[12:08:20] <robertmaxrees> this makes much more sense now.  so you want to upadte another page.
[12:08:23] <taplar> i've been meaning to write that into my pub/sub plugin, but haven't yet
[12:09:33] <robertmaxrees> i might rethink that strategy or look into a server push framework.  browser support's going to be your pain here.
[12:10:42] <taplar> i'm forgetting (and need to write down), but what was that method that the browsers started implemented to do something like that?  publishMessage() or something?
[12:11:24] <taplar> postMessage()
[12:11:41] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage
[12:11:54] <taplar> gotta watch support though like rob said
[12:25:58] <daslicht> hi
[12:26:00] <daslicht> how to get the cloned element in the activate function of dropable ?
[12:26:02] <daslicht> http://jsbin.com/guvutut/edit?css,js,output
[12:26:27] <daslicht> ui.draggamle in teh activate callback points to the mother element and not the clone
[12:27:29] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the activate can't give you that.
[12:27:52] <daslicht> and why is activate fired 3 times :)
[12:28:00] <robertmaxrees> "Triggered when an accepted draggable starts dragging. This can be useful if you want to make the droppable "light up" when it can be dropped on."
[12:28:22] <robertmaxrees> per http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/
[12:28:38] <daslicht> ok
[12:28:49] <daslicht> thanks , i try a different approach :)
[12:28:55] <robertmaxrees> rad
[12:29:07] <daslicht> huh?
[12:29:23] <robertmaxrees> like "cool"
[12:29:27] <daslicht> rapid application developement ?
[12:29:35] <robertmaxrees> short for "radical"
[12:29:42] <daslicht> ahh ok I dont know that experssion
[12:29:47] <daslicht> rad :)
[12:29:50] <robertmaxrees> people used to say it a lot in the 80's/early 90's.
[12:31:23] <daslicht> over ehere it was geil
[12:31:37] <taplar> bodacious!
[12:32:36] <taplar> had a 'bodacious videos' vhs rental place in my home town, :D
[12:32:41] <decx> dude... we still say geil
[12:32:58] <decx> we omit the oberaffen- now
[12:33:18] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:34:11] <robertmaxrees> what does oberaffengeil mean?
[12:34:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm curious.
[12:34:27] <taplar> i'm curious how you pronounce geil
[12:35:01] <no_maam> robertmaxrees: it means "very cool"
[12:35:12] <decx> like guile from streetfighter
[12:35:21] <taplar> ah, ty
[12:35:23] <decx> guy-LL
[12:35:25] <shoky> google translate is giving me "upper ape-horny", whcih indeed is very cool
[12:35:39] <decx> yeah it's a nonsense amalgation of words
[12:35:40] <taplar> well if your going to be apeish
[12:42:49] <decx> oh right you already have going apeshit
[12:43:06] <decx> that's basicly the positive spin on it
[12:43:22] <taplar> we don't say going apeshit anymore.  we say going trump
[12:43:40] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/eneu1pC.jpg
[12:43:41] <taplar> eh, that's not rair
[12:43:45] <taplar> *fair
[12:43:55] <taplar> more accurate to say 'going rogue'
[12:44:29] <taplar> wow, that makes me think of that one old horror movie
[12:45:22] <decx> like when you go apeshit in 1988 because you got a nintendo for christmas
[12:45:27] <decx> oberaffengeil
[12:45:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah we have apeshit.
[12:45:33] <taplar> lol
[12:48:01] <taplar> i probably hear postal more than anything now days
[12:48:36] <decx> going postal eh
[12:48:43] <decx> "would you like to sign my petition"
[12:48:44] <taplar> though that's outside work.  at work it's all 'losing his cool'
[12:49:08] <NoiseEee> i guess its been a while since someone's officially gone postal, eh?
[12:49:17] <NoiseEee> now its just a regular ol' mass shooting in public
[12:49:17] <taplar> well they reduced their hours
[12:49:44] * taplar is failing in the political jokes today
[12:50:13] <decx> i cant even make trump jokes anymore
[12:50:21] <decx> gone full circle into real life satire too long ago
[12:51:02] <NoiseEee> i lived the lite version via Rob Ford
[12:51:03] <taplar> i'll say this and i'll stop the political injection into the room. *eyes robert* ^_^
[12:51:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:51:18] <taplar> 'brexit' annoys me
[12:51:25] <Uhkis> AHA!
[12:51:26] <taplar> not the thing, but the word
[12:51:45] <decx> why it's catchy
[12:51:45] <Uhkis> gotta agree with that
[12:51:53] <taplar> everything has to have a name nowdays, -_-
[12:52:16] <Uhkis> taplar: this is kinda funny though: if it happens to finland, it's probably gonna be "fixit" :D
[12:52:18] <decx> better than "we're not actually going to get any of the things we promised because we just use eu and immigrants as a scapegoat"
[12:52:22] <taplar> lol
[12:53:46] <robertmaxrees> Grexit. Departugal. Italeave. Fruckoff. Czechout. Oustria. Finish. Slovakout. Latervia. Byegium
[12:54:19] <taplar> is Norway in the EU?
[12:54:23] <Uhkis> nope
[12:54:29] <taplar> aww
[12:54:33] <taplar> Noway would be fun
[12:54:59] <taplar> or poland, Polout
[12:55:10] <Uhkis> i prefer fixit to finish
[12:55:20] <Uhkis> poland is in eu iirc
[12:55:43] <taplar> sweet!  I support the Pollout!
[12:55:43] <sillyslux> ah there croatia
[12:55:50] <taplar> hard to get the male support on that one though
[12:55:51] <sillyslux> croachaway
[12:56:00] <decx> they keep electing eurosceptic rightwingers tho
[12:56:11] <NoiseEee> US out of North America Now!!!
[12:56:23] <decx> trump actually started saying he wants to leave nafta
[12:56:27] <decx> the absolute madman
[12:57:30] <Uhkis> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nafta#Noun_2
[12:57:31] <Uhkis> :)
[12:58:40] <taplar> can't have nafta with that wall i suppose
[13:05:45] <daslicht> why ios the sourec element removed , even tho I creted a clone ?
[13:05:46] <daslicht> http://jsbin.com/guvutut/edit?css,js,output
[13:06:44] <daslicht> when i drag i check if the item hast the class 'virgin'
[13:07:03] <daslicht> if it is virgin it clone it and return it in my draggable helper
[13:07:05] <robertmaxrees> because you're still dragging the original element or something like that.
[13:07:12] <daslicht> why ?
[13:07:21] <daslicht> $(".item" ).clone();
[13:07:25] <robertmaxrees> because that's how draggable works?
[13:07:27] <daslicht> dont that return a new elem ?
[13:07:38] <daslicht> yeh by default ?
[13:07:43] <daslicht> but i have a helper
[13:08:17] <daslicht> if i use the "clone" helper it doesnt remove the source
[13:08:21] <daslicht> have you looked in my code ?
[13:08:25] <taplar> probably have to create the new guy in the drop, and then cancel the drop for the original
[13:08:47] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-helper
[13:08:49] <daslicht> hm double clone ?
[13:08:52] <robertmaxrees> just set the helper to "clone"
[13:08:57] <robertmaxrees> instead of rolling your own.
[13:09:00] <daslicht> nope
[13:09:07] <daslicht> i need the custom helper
[13:09:23] <daslicht> robertmaxrees: I know the docs....
[13:09:31] <decx> add more clones then ^^
[13:09:39] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* you weren't being specific about what you needed duder.
[13:09:39] <decx> then you can say.. "this app is a real clonecar"
[13:09:40] <daslicht> focus()
[13:09:50] <taplar> nyce
[13:09:55] <robertmaxrees> plus we get a TON of people who don't read the docs.  soooo not unreasonable for me to suggest ;)
[13:10:07] <daslicht> robertmaxrees: i posted an extensive example but you havent even looked at it
[13:10:11] <robertmaxrees> sure i have.
[13:10:15] <taplar> we don't have to help you dude
[13:10:19] <robertmaxrees> i just didn't kick at it extensively :)
[13:10:20] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[13:10:29] <daslicht> i apologize taplar
[13:10:35] <decx> sorry licht, i only saw jsbin and noped out ^^
[13:10:40] <daslicht> i just kindly for help
[13:10:59] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Hey guys, is it considered bad coding practice to reinclude js after updating a table with new content after .load()? I have a file manager that uses .selectable() and when I open a new folder I have to reload the selectable js. I do not know how to make selectable work with .on to make it a delegate.
[13:11:00] <daslicht> do you prefer jsfiddle ?
[13:11:11] <robertmaxrees> i was giving the best advice i could give based on the original description :)
[13:11:11] <daslicht> i like bin because of auto run :D
[13:11:24] <daslicht> anything fine
[13:11:25] <robertmaxrees> UnfixedSNIPERJ yep.
[13:11:45] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to reinclude JS.  what's "the selectable js"?
[13:11:50] <decx> daslicht: _child_item = $(ui.draggable).clone();
[13:11:54] <daslicht> I am just curious when my clone is not used even thou i return it :D
[13:12:03] <decx> otherwise it's just a reference to the original in memory
[13:12:08] <decx> and as such moves it
[13:12:18] <daslicht> dect: the helper doent have a second patramter :D
[13:12:24] <shoky> daslicht: it is used, but it is then removed (as it's just a "helper")
[13:12:24] <daslicht> decx
[13:12:34] <decx> i mean in the drop function
[13:12:50] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/Twisty/3gggh6bg/21/
[13:13:04] <shoky> daslicht: and you can access the helper with ui.helper instead of ui.draggable, btw
[13:13:25] <shoky> tho you don't really need to here
[13:13:37] <daslicht> decx: but than I have to use the activate callacck which doesnt know of the dragged element hehe
[13:13:43] <daslicht> that was my first approch
[13:13:45] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> I have that, but when I use .load() to update the table it breaks the entire selectable/draggable/droppable functionality that is used in the fiddle I posted
[13:14:02] <robertmaxrees> right because those elements probably need to be initialized.
[13:14:20] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i dont really know how to make it work with .on, all of my attempts have failed, so I am relying on including the js
[13:14:35] <robertmaxrees> you don't use .on() here because your issue isn't just the event handler.
[13:15:08] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> how do I initialize the new elements?
[13:15:17] <robertmaxrees> try running .selectable('refresh') after you add the new stuff.
[13:15:34] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> ok
[13:16:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/weusjepu/
[13:16:42] <taplar> just so i can stop looking at paste
[13:16:49] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:19:03] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/weusjepu/1/ <-- well it drags once
[13:19:53] <decx> what's with the extra helper on the bottom on the second drag
[13:20:39] <shoky> $(".item").clone()
[13:21:47] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/weusjepu/2/ `?
[13:22:50] <shoky> great job
[13:22:58] <decx> is it tho?
[13:23:07] <taplar> looks like only a single extra drag still
[13:23:07] <shoky> i dunno, what are you asking about
[13:23:11] <shoky> oh
[13:23:22] <taplar> daslicht: yo, you still browsing?
[13:23:30] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> robertmaxrees, I would still need to use .on in conjunction with refresh, right?
[13:23:30] <daslicht> yeah
[13:23:32] <taplar> we're poking your code, :P
[13:23:33] <shoky> they cease to be virgins, hence..
[13:23:40] <daslicht> thats what i had first : https://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/bqm1onmy/2/
[13:24:15] <taplar> fk, you guys are going to get me humming madonna
[13:24:30] <daslicht> but then I dont know how to get the child elememnt on drag, so that I can change its css
[13:24:50] <daslicht> :D
[13:25:18] <daslicht> heck
[13:25:28] <daslicht> let me find teh correct snapshot
[13:26:44] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/hqoj65w0/2/
[13:26:46] <daslicht> ok thats it
[13:27:04] <shoky> daslicht: ui.helper
[13:27:18] <daslicht> why ?
[13:27:39] <shoky> daslicht: if you want to get the dragged element itself
[13:27:42] <shoky> if not, ignore me
[13:28:00] <daslicht> there is no UI in the activate callback
[13:28:25] <taplar> that's a little heavy, your reinitializing all the draggables
[13:28:52] <daslicht> taplar, yeah still lokking for a better solution
[13:29:17] <shoky> you were given one
[13:29:20] <daslicht> but first i need to set the correct css to maintain the width of the item when i start dragging it
[13:29:41] <daslicht> shoky: wjhere ?
[13:30:03] <daslicht> ok i browser the history here , and try all fiddles
[13:30:06] <shoky> taplar or decx's fiddles
[13:30:17] * robertmaxrees grabs some popcorn
[13:30:24] <decx> salted or sweet
[13:30:36] <robertmaxrees> why not both?!
[13:30:42] <robertmaxrees> (lightly salted, easy on the butter)
[13:30:44] <taplar> don't fkn bite me
[13:31:29] <daslicht> shoky: they do not reinit ...
[13:32:55] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/hqoj65w0/3/
[13:32:58] <shoky> daslicht: they initialize draggable on the child_item thing
[13:33:23] <daslicht> shoky: i have solved that in my fiddle as well ...
[13:33:44] <shoky> daslicht: no you called .draggable() on elements that were already draggable
[13:33:58] <taplar> also $virgin is a boolean, not a jQ object, iirc
[13:34:24] <shoky> daslicht: and if you solved it in your fiddle, then this is odd..  <daslicht> taplar, yeah still lokking for a better solution
[13:35:44] <daslicht> taplar: great , so if you pass initializeDraggable an item it will be used anyways all with teh class item
[13:35:48] <taplar> also ui.draggable is already a jQ object
[13:35:51] <daslicht> great ! thank you very much !
[13:36:40] <robertmaxrees> another satisfied customer
[13:36:51] <daslicht> partially :)
[13:36:56] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:37:00] <daslicht> that just the double init
[13:37:01] <taplar> and i'm not done refactoring yet
[13:37:07] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[13:37:08] <robertmaxrees> taplar++
[13:37:10] <daslicht> lol
[13:37:42] <daslicht> the main issue was how to get the dragged child element
[13:38:33] <daslicht> at the moment when you grap a child element (no longer virgin) it maintains 33% width
[13:38:49] <daslicht> which leads to the resulat that it gets smaller in width
[13:39:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/hqoj65w0/5/
[13:39:14] <daslicht> the goal is that it stays at the same with
[13:39:33] <taplar> little cleaner
[13:39:37] <taplar> less wrapping
[13:39:39] <daslicht> thank you taplar
[13:39:43] <taplar> more country
[13:40:10] <daslicht> dont worry about cleanness
[13:40:12] <taplar> ok, so the 'virgin' class has the width on it
[13:40:15] <daslicht> i will clean it myself
[13:40:20] <decx> i'm a little bit functionalll and i'm a little bit static typing
[13:40:22] <taplar> which your taking off
[13:40:26] <daslicht> yeah
[13:40:30] <taplar> so....
[13:40:34] <taplar> ;)
[13:40:45] <daslicht> other case it would stay 33% wide
[13:40:48] <daslicht> hehe
[13:40:53] <daslicht> 33% of the new parent :)
[13:41:00] <taplar> maybe put another class on it with the width that does not get removed?
[13:41:18] <daslicht> yeh but how to add it on drag ?!
[13:41:28] <taplar> why add it on drag?
[13:41:31] <taplar> just default it
[13:41:40] <daslicht> how ?
[13:41:55] <taplar> how are you putting virgin on it?
[13:42:00] <taplar> same way
[13:42:31] <daslicht> for that i would need to get the elment on drag :)
[13:42:39] <daslicht> thats why i ask all the time :D
[13:43:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/hqoj65w0/6/
[13:43:27] <daslicht> yeah but now you have 33.3 % in teh colum :)
[13:43:37] <daslicht> in the colum i need 100%
[13:43:37] <taplar> so don't base your width on the parent
[13:43:59] <taplar> any time you have a relative value, of course it's going to change
[13:44:22] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/hqoj65w0/7/
[13:44:26] <daslicht> thats the other way around
[13:44:43] <daslicht> I either got iot like you or like my last fiddle
[13:44:55] <daslicht> but teh size should stay always the same
[13:46:03] <daslicht> isnt there something like 'onStartDrag' ?
[13:46:16] <taplar> yep, looking for it now
[13:46:21] <daslicht> :D
[13:46:34] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#event-start
[13:46:49] <daslicht> gosh
[13:46:52] <daslicht> start: function( event, ui ) {}
[13:49:56] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/hqoj65w0/8/
[13:50:10] <daslicht> tada
[13:50:23] <taplar> cool
[13:50:42] <daslicht> shoky: ui.helper whas quite close but related to draggable
[13:50:58] <daslicht> ui.draggable is related to droppable
[13:51:28] <jim___> hello. I am using RAILS, but i need the fanciest possible drag n drop inventory. I think i have installed jquery on my server
[13:52:18] <daslicht> taplar: thank you very much !
[13:52:47] <taplar> two good ideas in one day.  i'm over stepping my quota
[13:53:20] * taplar wanders back to his other work
[13:53:34] <decx> na just go home
[13:53:36] <decx> go out on top
[13:53:44] <decx> pulling a costanza
[13:54:50] <taplar> awww, why you make me google things
[13:55:08] <jim___> Come on goiiz!! Need guide for usefull JS
[13:55:11] <decx> you have to google seinfeld references?
[13:55:12] <taplar> ah
[13:55:19] <decx> shame
[13:55:20] <taplar> wasn't a big fan
[13:55:22] <decx> shame
[13:55:27] <decx> shame, ding ding ding
[13:55:55] <taplar> jim___: wut?
[13:56:59] <jim___> i am trying to insert JQUERY into a RAILS app. I don't know how to check if i have it installed and I don't know how to create a dnd inventory, and yes I would like it to be pretty
[13:58:07] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you keep capping those works.
[13:58:16] <jim___> taplar: that make sense?
[13:58:16] <jim___> Not css pretty, like animatedish
[13:58:28] <robertmaxrees> either way - go to a page, go to the console, and wipe in $.fn.jquery
[13:58:34] <robertmaxrees> if that gives you a number, it's on the page.
[13:58:51] <jim___> ok. result. thanks
[13:59:10] <robertmaxrees> is it?
[13:59:21] <robertmaxrees> doesn't rails have some kind of asset pipeline that handles all of this for you?
[14:02:43] <VectorX> got a issue on this page i cant seem to pin-point, if you click the tabs the content is hidden and shown, also same effect is supposed to work with the image of the pipe using a image-map, but when you go to a tab the map doesnt seem to take effect, http://bit.ly/29b9Tre
[14:03:21] <robertmaxrees> where's the JS?
[14:03:31] <robertmaxrees> we're lazy.  don't make us hunt around for your code.
[14:04:20] <VectorX> in the js in the page, https://jsfiddle.net/qshogeLu/
[14:04:35] <robertmaxrees> also, it looks like you're only binding to the first tab's version of the pipe
[14:04:40] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: you actually click shortened urls?
[14:05:00] <taplar> robert has love for all shorties
[14:05:32] <robertmaxrees> where's the handler for the pip VectorX?
[14:05:32] <VectorX> robertmaxrees well the image should take on the maps without any js, but doesnt seem to be happening
[14:06:10] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:06:14] <VectorX> line 12-16
[14:06:20] <robertmaxrees> usemap="#pipeline-image-2" etc
[14:06:23] <robertmaxrees> you sure that's right?
[14:06:25] <Uhkis> taplar: all i see with those is: click4cash
[14:06:34] <taplar> ah
[14:07:10] <robertmaxrees> jQuery('img[usemap]').rwdImageMaps(); looks to be your problem.
[14:07:13] <Uhkis> or cash4click, anyways not good things
[14:07:21] <robertmaxrees> maybe?  not sure.
[14:07:43] <VectorX> robertmaxrees, if i remove the hide class 'close' from the tabs it works
[14:07:50] <VectorX> let me update quickly
[14:08:00] <robertmaxrees> VectorX i feel like i'm missing code here.
[14:08:05] <VectorX> its all there
[14:08:06] <robertmaxrees> hence why fiddles are rad.
[14:08:25] <robertmaxrees> also: .prop() instead of .attr()
[14:09:14] <VectorX> update, i removed the .closed from  from the lines like <div id="content-tab-2" class='content-tab  '> and now the maps work for the images
[14:10:12] <robertmaxrees> none of the code you shared refers to a closed class sooo.
[14:10:13] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[14:11:03] <VectorX> i put it back on if you refresh, but now the images lose the map coordinate
[14:12:27] <robertmaxrees> so what does that class have to do with anything?
[14:12:28] <VectorX> the container with the tabs has the .closed calss, <div id="content-tab-1" class="content-tab closed  selected ">  to display i add .selected
[14:13:24] <VectorX> if i take it out then all the tabs will be displayed and the images have coordinates
[14:13:33] <robertmaxrees> right.  so why does that class have any bearing on the handler.
[14:14:57] <VectorX> im trying to figure out why the image maps are losing the coordinates
[14:16:36] <robertmaxrees> you know you could specify one map that works for all of these yeah?
[14:17:19] <VectorX> robertmaxrees i started with that but i guess with the common issue i wasnt able to get it working
[14:17:40] <VectorX> i did have the map defined seperately and all the imaged usemap to it
[14:17:46] <VectorX> it wasnt taking the coords
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> i just changed the usemap to #pipeline-image-1 and things worked fine.
[14:18:09] <VectorX> let me try
[14:18:58] <VectorX> code updated
[14:19:15] <VectorX> do you want me to move the <map> out of <article>
[14:19:22] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:19:28] <robertmaxrees> how are you generating your image maps?
[14:19:35] <VectorX> so it doesnt make 4
[14:19:37] <decx> in the 90s
[14:19:42] <decx> who uses maps still ^^
[14:19:56] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, i'd only make one.  but seriously you've got something major broken here.
[14:20:53] <VectorX> moved it out and named #pipeline-map
[14:21:22] <robertmaxrees> your maps are busted still.
[14:21:25] <robertmaxrees> how are you generating them?
[14:22:09] <VectorX> its the same image dimentions do the map is created with dreamweaver and i just have the same block of code
[14:22:31] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:22:36] <robertmaxrees> you need to just edit the code in a text editor.
[14:22:42] <robertmaxrees> something tells me dreamweaver is screwing with you.
[14:22:49] <robertmaxrees> becuase your coords are all set to 0s.
[14:22:56] <decx> just use svg bro
[14:23:01] <robertmaxrees> ^ or this.
[14:23:03] <decx> responsive
[14:23:04] <ozz> hi
[14:23:05] <decx> links
[14:23:18] <ozz> I have a question related to get
[14:23:23] <robertmaxrees> ozz ask away.
[14:24:13] <decx> svg imagemap with https://jsfiddle.net/decx/qmoudutx/
[14:24:26] <decx> with links
[14:24:35] <decx> i linked a link instead of writing links, not bad
[14:25:36] <VectorX> decx how did you create the map
[14:25:43] <decx> inkscape
[14:25:56] <ozz> http://pastebin.com/FTe8ANLy
[14:25:56] <VectorX> robertmaxrees ok cool i think i might be seeing the issue now
[14:26:54] <robertmaxrees> ozz let me guess that onclick isn't working for the things you add in the .get()?
[14:27:12] <ozz> how can I access outside global variables in the     $.get('games.json', function(data) {
[14:27:13] <ozz> yes
[14:27:20] <robertmaxrees> Your problem isn't that.
[14:27:26] <robertmaxrees> you want a delegated listener instead.
[14:27:30] <robertmaxrees> Read up on https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:27:30] <ozz> I set stuff in the on click
[14:27:45] <ozz> and than when I print it
[14:27:46] <robertmaxrees> right, you wnat a delegated listener - you can't bind to things that don't yet exist.
[14:27:50] <ozz> its empty
[14:28:13] <robertmaxrees> read those two pages.  and don't skip to the code examples.
[14:28:21] <robertmaxrees> everybody always does and makes the same mistake.
[14:28:22] <robertmaxrees> \
[14:28:28] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[14:28:56] <jim___> hello, i put the following in to test if i have jquery on my rails app : $.fn.jquery
[14:29:10] <ozz> thanx I will read your links
[14:29:16] <jim___> what  am I supposed to get?
[14:30:26] <jim___> robertmaxrees: are you still online?
[14:30:39] <decx> that gives you the version
[14:30:48] <decx> so a string
[14:31:17] <jim___> decx: All it did was print itself. should i put it in a fn?
[14:31:38] <decx> it's function that returns a string
[14:31:43] <jim___> like in a js file or html or something
[14:32:21] <decx> no idea where and how you test fam
[14:32:40] <decx> shit i started writing and saying fam
[14:32:45] <decx> damn cultural osmosis
[14:37:13] <jim___> Any pointers on how to set up a fancy DND inventory?
[14:37:54] <jim___> fancie
[14:41:15] <jim___> like animated an ting
[14:42:16] <VectorX> robertmaxrees got it working, and your clue of the coords being 0 gave me the hint, i added jQuery('img[usemap]').rwdImageMaps(); once again when the new image is displayed, which calculated them again
[14:42:44] <VectorX> this is why 1 map didnt work, coz it would calculate the last image which is hidden and make it all 0
[14:42:52] <VectorX> so went back to 4
[15:20:49] <edisla1992> hi
[15:22:55] <taplar> aloha
[15:27:07] <jose3_> bonjour Amigos
[15:27:54] <taplar> french spanyard, nice
[15:28:12] <jose3_> What do yall think of this code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ae30823560fef12772e1b15e58361c83
[15:28:12] <jose3_> Is this code not crap? I find myself doing a lot  of string manipulation through my code. is this normal?
[15:30:22] <taplar> i'm slightly confused by the for loop
[15:30:32] <taplar> your getting the keys just to get the length?
[15:31:05] <jose3_> yes- because i cannot call .length on my 'var data'
[15:31:24] <taplar> right, but you can't just forEach on the keys directly?
[15:31:39] <taplar> Object.keys(data).forEach(function(key){...
[15:31:47] <taplar> ?
[15:32:00] <jose3_> I probabbly can do that... yes indeed
[15:32:23] <taplar> might clean it up a bit.  but your concerned with string manipulation you say?
[15:32:23] <decx> reduce into jsonData
[15:32:34] <jose3_> I shall heed your advice
[15:32:57] <jose3_> Well not particularly in this case, but my code is literred with all sorts of string manipulation
[15:33:28] <taplar> i guess it depends on what manipulations your talking about
[15:33:35] <jose3_> But I assume I can't get around that withough changing the data
[15:33:43] <jose3_> basically very similar to what is in this function
[15:34:03] <taplar> like for locationOfEvents
[15:34:39] <jose3_> yes
[15:35:19] <taplar> imho, typically your returned model should be granular enough to work for the majority of your logic.  if you have some one offs that you have to break apart, not a big thing
[15:35:34] <taplar> but if your always having to break stuff up to reformat, probably should be returned more granular to start with
[15:36:33] <taplar> *where possible
[15:36:48] <jose3_> hmmm i see
[15:36:58] <jose3_> well thanks
[15:37:05] <jose3_> Ill look into fixing this up a bit
[15:45:48] <jose3_> taplar:  The forEach part worked well, its much cleaner I think. Thanks !!
[15:45:56] <taplar> cool
[15:51:38] <jose3_> just of of curiosity in terms of computation/load is using the forEach the same as using a for looop
[15:51:49] <taplar> pretty much
[15:52:33] <taplar> if there's any performance difference between Array.prototype.forEach and a for loop i'd think it would be neglegible
[15:56:28] <robertmaxrees> I'd bet there's some extra overhead from the scopes that get created, but i'd bet those are so negligible that you'd never notice it.
[16:24:44] <introspectr> I've got an <li class="has-click-event-handler-bound"><input type="checkbox" /></li>... the li's click handler is preventing users from checking/unchecking the checkboxes. is there an easyish fix for this?
[16:25:22] <robertmaxrees> fix the handler?
[16:32:22] <robertmaxrees> or bind a listener to the child element that stops propagation maybe?
[22:14:01] <earational> hey
[22:41:12] <liulanghan> how do you select all other elements that are similar but not just the siblings, every element on the dom?
[23:10:59] <elisa87> hey why $(this).addClass("animated shake"); doesn't shake the item?
