[00:18:50] <linuxson> Hey guys. Quick question....I have an external jquery file which I am "importing" into my html file when needed to display 3x graphs. Problem is, I need to use this script 3x times at different places in the html file, which results in the jquery code displaying 3x times per graph when the html page is rendered. How can I prevent this from happening?
[00:51:09] <aiena> I have a menu with `<li>` tags each li tag comprising of one  `a href` inside them. Is there a way in jquery that clicking on the `li` tag will trigger the `a href` inside it ?
[00:52:00] <aiena> One non JS way was to make the a href tag a block element but that created issues with styling
[01:05:16] <Cork> aiena: the best option is to correct the css so the <a> tag becomes the entire visible area
[01:05:44] <Cork> aiena: if the href is an url and you want to emulate the navigation, then not really
[01:06:08] <carpii> you could trigger a .click on the "a" tho right?
[01:06:10] <Cork> you can fake part of it, but not completely (<a> default action is a trusted event and can't be triggered from js)
[01:06:20] <carpii> ah, yeah fair point
[01:20:14] <aiena> Ok thank you. I made the a tag  block and fixed the css
[01:21:08] <aiena> *<a> tag a block element like before
[01:38:58] <Chulbul> Dealing with a serious issue, code needs to be moved to production soon but it seems I need to rollback. I would greatly appreciate any help. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41633144/highstock-tooltip-displacement-tooltip-content-picks-previous-days-data-on
[01:40:54] <apoorv> hello there! I am actually new to this place and im looking for something that i can work, im really interested to contribute towards jquery
[01:40:57] <apoorv> please help me
[05:12:12] <MOUD> Hey all
[05:58:34] <Alocat> hey. I have so far declared jquery in loop as follows: "var boo = $(this)" Assuming that $ (this) accesses the framework only once. Am I wrong?
[05:59:37] <slax0r> why would you do this?
[05:59:53] <slax0r> what are you trying to achieve?
[06:01:07] <Alocat> just when I often access the element $(this)
[06:02:48] <Alocat> like -> var me = $(this);
[06:02:48] <Alocat>         var txt = me.text();
[06:02:48] <Alocat>         var prr = me.attr('prr_id');
[06:03:01] <Cork> Alocat: depends on the loop
[06:03:12] <Cork> if it is in a for() loop then no
[06:03:25] <Cork> also use jsfiddle.net
[06:03:33] <dni-> if its an jquery .each then yes
[06:03:48] <dni-> if its a .forEach, no
[06:04:47] <Cork> there is many more then that though
[06:05:17] <Cork> so the context matters for the answer, that was what i was trying to say
[06:05:45] <Alocat> thank You
[06:06:19] <Cork> Alocat: btw attr('prr_id'); <-- don't do this
[06:06:25] <dni-> truetrue :) thats what i was trying to say too :)
[06:06:30] <Cork> use data() or 'data-prr-id'
[06:06:43] <Cork> DON'T create unprefixed element attributes
[06:07:19] <Alocat> ok
[06:08:26] <Cork> fyi, the reason for this is that when that becomes too common it breaks future standards, and forces us to get crappy standards cause they have to work around names ppl add
[06:08:51] <Cork> it also, if it doesn't becomes a commonly used name, means your site will break from future spec changes
[06:10:04] <Alocat> I'll remember that
[06:10:55] <Cork> and this is why the data- prefix was added as a reserved prefix, and the spec promises to never create an attribute starting with that
[06:56:20] <ctmarco> Hello all autocomplete not working for me
[06:56:25] <ctmarco> What problem might be?
[07:06:28] <Cork> ctmarco: could you create a jsfiddle.net showing what you're trying to do?
[07:07:28] <ctmarco> I have jquery-ui.js
[07:07:45] <ctmarco> and     $("#emailInput").autocomplete({         source: emails     });
[07:08:14] <Cork> => http://jsfiddle.net
[07:28:33] <cannap> can any tell me why this one bounces http://codepen.io/cannap/pen/VPKBYy?editors=1111 ?
[07:28:39] <cannap> when i close
[07:33:48] <cannap> i fixed
[07:42:25] <ctmarco> https://jsfiddle.net/Labdy9f4/ Why autocomplete not work here for me?
[07:44:41] <cannap> is not a function
[08:04:29] <AdamPDotty> guess you did not include jquery-ui for the example.
[08:29:43] <ctmarco> AdamPDotty: I included
[08:29:45] <ctmarco> it
[08:33:25] <cannap> @ctmarco, https://jsfiddle.net/Labdy9f4/1/
[08:34:46] <AdamPDotty> so it works
[08:35:05] <AdamPDotty> plus you do not need dom.ready @ jsfiddle
[09:12:36] <rjCousineau> Hi, I'm running jquery script inside a local .html file.  i'm trying to use $.getJSON() to a script on a webserver to get data, but Chrome is giving me: XMLHttpRequest cannot load <script> No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
[09:13:05] <rjCousineau> I understand this is a security feature that can't be worked around.
[09:13:30] <rjCousineau> But, it would be nice if I could get around this :(
[09:13:41] <AdamPDotty> You can turn it off for yourself.
[09:14:22] <rjCousineau> AdamPDotty:  I don't know who's using it, the browser is launch automatically by windows on http command
[09:14:41] <rjCousineau> by Chrome being default web browser for the OS
[09:15:46] <AdamPDotty> maybe you can change default browser to chrome.exe --disable-web-security
[09:16:09] <rjCousineau> thats a good idea
[09:32:05] <rjCousineau> made it work using CORS, thank you
[09:39:41] <dglambert> morning
[12:16:22] <duch_kazatel> goooooood morning #jquery
[12:34:56] <Hollusionist> why does $form.clone() not clone the input selections?
[12:36:12] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/clone/ this explains why.
[12:36:21] <Hollusionist> is there a built in way to feed a cloned form the .serializeArray() data from the old form?
[12:37:18] <robertmaxrees> it's built-in to .clone ()
[12:37:23] <robertmaxrees> *.clone()
[12:38:00] <Hollusionist> hmm does not seem to work in my case
[12:38:15] <Hollusionist> i have several <select> fields and the clone does not take over the selections
[12:38:26] <robertmaxrees> are you passing the two args to clone?\
[12:38:34] <Hollusionist> clone(true, true)
[12:38:39] <robertmaxrees> should work.
[12:38:55] <robertmaxrees> ah
[12:38:55] <robertmaxrees> Note: For performance reasons, the dynamic state of certain form elements (e.g., user data typed into textarea and user selections made to a select) is not copied to the cloned elements. When cloning input elements, the dynamic state of the element (e.g., user data typed into text inputs and user selections made to a checkbox) is retained in the cloned elements.
[12:39:42] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/4599828/923919
[12:39:47] <Hollusionist> thank you
[12:39:51] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to accomplish it.
[12:41:10] <PhpNoob> hi
[12:41:16] <PhpNoob> i have question
[12:42:08] <robertmaxrees> shoot
[12:42:47] <PhpNoob> i have modal and user record submit form, after submit modal closing auto. its ok. but after close i need select latest record user from field.
[12:43:10] <PhpNoob> $('div#user p:last').attr('id') i used this but not work
[12:43:24] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:43:40] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle or something to show us?
[12:43:58] <PhpNoob> its php because if i dont have fiddle.
[12:44:00] <robertmaxrees> because "i need select latest record user from field" is kind of vague.
[12:44:05] <robertmaxrees> oh, which channel then :)
[12:44:12] <robertmaxrees> *wrong
[12:44:29] <PhpNoob> why?
[12:44:39] <robertmaxrees> you said it's PHP.
[12:44:47] <PhpNoob> but im using js
[12:44:50] <PhpNoob> i sent it
[12:45:11] <robertmaxrees> then make a fiddle with the rendered markup.
[12:45:18] <PhpNoob> $('#my-modal').on('hidden.bs.modal', function () {
[12:45:19] <robertmaxrees> give me something to work with :)
[12:45:23] <PhpNoob> $('div#clients p:last').attr('id')
[12:45:38] <PhpNoob> i used it but not workin g
[12:45:38] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your html it's practically impossible for me to assis.
[12:45:47] <PhpNoob> but do you understand it
[12:45:53] <robertmaxrees> you assume we can see your html and know what you're trying to select.
[12:46:07] <robertmaxrees> $('div#clients p:last') looks for the last <p> in #clients
[12:46:14] <PhpNoob> i used modal
[12:46:18] <robertmaxrees> make sure you aren't duplicating IDs.
[12:46:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:46:30] <PhpNoob> after submit form
[12:46:33] <robertmaxrees> duder - without markup we can't do much more than make guesses.
[12:46:35] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:46:36] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[12:46:38] <PhpNoob> i want to see in user field latest record
[12:47:19] <robertmaxrees> how are we supposed to help you troubleshoot a selector if we can't see the html you're working with?
[12:48:02] <PhpNoob> its in php
[12:48:10] <robertmaxrees> the js doesnm
[12:48:15] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't interact with php though.
[12:48:20] <robertmaxrees> it interacts with the rendered HTML.
[12:48:27] <robertmaxrees> so you can copy that rendered markup and show us that.
[12:49:01] <PhpNoob> before i used it :  document.location.reload();
[12:49:05] <PhpNoob> but its only reloaded page
[12:49:21] <PhpNoob> not selected latest record from field
[12:49:39] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) good luck.
[12:50:30] <PhpNoob> i think thats need only some code
[12:50:45] <PhpNoob> js code
[12:50:47] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:50:51] <robertmaxrees> we cannot help you.
[12:51:04] <PhpNoob> can you dream it?
[12:51:08] <PhpNoob> because its simple
[12:51:09] <Aljone> i got some wierd situation, im sending ajax post to http://localhost/hostname.php < ths file echo the hostname of the localmachin, inside my ajax i have fail and done, the post is successfull but it gets into the FAIL function :/ i deas?
[12:51:19] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob if it's simple then you can fix it.
[12:51:22] <jose3__> hi
[12:51:26] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, please supply some HTML/JS for us to look at.
[12:51:31] <PhpNoob> my js is not good
[12:51:34] <robertmaxrees> if you can't, then we can't help.  pretty cut and dry.
[12:51:38] <Aljone> robertmaxrees: common
[12:51:49] <jose3__> I have a react question: https://cl.ly/3W0o2v3O1q03. How can I grab the id here?
[12:51:50] <robertmaxrees> Aljone bad return.
[12:51:57] <Aljone> ok let me show u the php
[12:51:59] <robertmaxrees> jose3__ wrong place for react help.
[12:52:01] <robertmaxrees> Aljone no.
[12:52:03] <robertmaxrees> show the html/js
[12:52:13] <robertmaxrees> if you need help with php, go to a channel for PHP :)
[12:52:15] <Aljone> header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * ');header('content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8');echo gethostname();
[12:52:33] <robertmaxrees> show the js.
[12:52:35] <Aljone> but the fail function return the actual gethostname each
[12:52:46] <robertmaxrees> what's the return data look like?
[12:53:00] <PhpNoob> after submit create user form modal, then in page i want to auto select user id. in user field. thats all
[12:53:14] <Aljone> var ajax = $.ajax( { url: 'http://localhost/hostname.php',        crossDomain: true,          type: 'POST',         data: {              data : 1             }          }       ).fail(function(data) {}).done(function(data){});
[12:53:15] <PhpNoob> i dont know how to do
[12:53:16] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob the one from yoru backend?
[12:53:21] <robertmaxrees> Aljone not in the shannel dude
[12:53:24] <robertmaxrees> use a paste service.
[12:53:25] <PhpNoob> backend yes
[12:53:30] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob then go to a php channel.
[12:53:38] <PhpNoob> but its not php its js
[12:53:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to expose that data from your backend first.
[12:53:47] <PhpNoob> thats js process
[12:53:50] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:53:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:53:55] <robertmaxrees> you JUST said it's in your backend.
[12:54:04] <robertmaxrees> then you use ajax on the js side to submit and get that info back.
[12:54:05] <PhpNoob> data is already come
[12:54:07] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic process.
[12:54:11] <robertmaxrees> so you're using ajax?
[12:54:14] <PhpNoob> i dont have problem with record data
[12:54:18] <robertmaxrees> or are you setting the ID somewhere on page?
[12:54:41] <robertmaxrees> if the page is doing a full reload, why not just set that info using the php side?
[12:54:50] <PhpNoob> field is working i just want in field show latest record after submit modal form
[12:54:56] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob are you using ajax?
[12:55:03] <PhpNoob> for what?
[12:55:08] <robertmaxrees> handling the form submit.
[12:55:16] <PhpNoob> yes
[12:55:31] <robertmaxrees> so then you respond to the ajax request with the user data and use that,.
[12:55:32] <PhpNoob> i can show it kopy.io
[12:55:33] <robertmaxrees> done.
[12:55:56] <PhpNoob> how?
[12:56:11] <robertmaxrees> i just explained how ;)
[12:56:18] <robertmaxrees> return the user data you care about via that ajax call.
[12:56:27] <robertmaxrees> populate the fields you want.
[12:56:35] <PhpNoob> is there any example?
[12:56:55] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com learn.jquery.com try.jquery.com
[12:57:06] <robertmaxrees> there should be enough between those to get you started.
[12:57:14] <robertmaxrees> Aljone so what does your return data look like?
[12:57:20] <robertmaxrees> can you paste that real quick?
[12:57:24] <PhpNoob> whats the name is? i mean i want to search it in google
[12:57:33] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:57:40] <robertmaxrees> you want to use ajax.
[12:57:43] <PhpNoob> yes
[12:57:48] <robertmaxrees> like... that's it.
[12:57:54] <robertmaxrees> there's no special specifics.  you just gotta learn ajax.
[12:58:10] <robertmaxrees> the three sites above should give you great info and ideas to work off of :)
[12:58:57] <PhpNoob> i need example for it
[12:59:08] <robertmaxrees> the sites above should give you what you need :)
[12:59:19] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:01:03] <PhpNoob> there is million document
[13:01:06] <PhpNoob> which one is for me?
[13:02:22] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:02:53] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[13:22:45] <qakhan> hi all, is it possible that we can assign JS variable value to PHP variable?
[13:23:17] <robertmaxrees> they're two different languages.
[13:23:34] <robertmaxrees> but you can output data to the page and go from there.
[13:24:30] <qakhan> i have values in JS variable, now i need to save that values in php variables
[13:25:13] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really work that way without forms.
[13:26:50] <qakhan> so i need to send values through forms? can you please share an example
[13:27:36] <duch_kazatel> qakhan could you describe what you're trying to accomplish?
[13:31:47] <qakhan> i have user authention page. i got users login values in JS. now i want to save JS variable values in PHP $_Session['id'], $_Session['name'] etc.... variables. so i can use these php variables on next page
[13:32:04] <qakhan> authentication page*
[13:39:01] <Aljone> damn my connection droped
[13:40:10] <robertmaxrees> qakhan you do that via a form post.
[13:40:17] <robertmaxrees> Aljone figure out your problem?
[13:41:15] <Aljone> not really
[13:41:33] <qakhan> robertmaxrees i am using ajax
[13:41:36] <Aljone> it gets into the fail function but when i console.log(data) i see the success inside
[13:42:19] <Aljone> how do i figure out what exactly made it to go to fial function?
[13:42:40] <robertmaxrees> qakhan then have your backend save those vars (shrug)
[13:42:50] <robertmaxrees> Aljone what's the data you're getting back?
[13:43:31] <Aljone> im getting an object with alot of things inside
[13:43:33] <Aljone> for example
[13:43:43] <robertmaxrees> is it valid JSON?
[13:43:46] <Aljone> statusText: "OK"
[13:43:51] <robertmaxrees> because that can cause failures.
[13:44:11] <Aljone> no the data comming back is just a string "test success"
[13:44:13] <Aljone> no json
[13:44:18] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[13:44:29] <robertmaxrees> you're saying the response will be JSON and then not actually sending JSON.
[13:44:41] <Aljone> i tried to change it
[13:44:46] <Aljone> but it didnt help
[13:44:48] <Aljone> ill try again
[13:45:10] <Aljone> ill remove the content header type
[13:45:33] <Aljone> the same error comes back
[13:45:39] <robertmaxrees> what's the request look like?
[13:45:41] <robertmaxrees> the ajax call.
[13:46:18] <Aljone> omh
[13:46:20] <Aljone> omg
[13:46:22] <Aljone> its success now!
[13:46:27] <Aljone> no error
[13:46:56] <Aljone> i just added echo 111; to the hostname file
[13:47:43] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:47:51] <Gsham> im using jquery mobile touch events and swiperight is too sensitive on my iphone
[13:48:04] <Gsham> literally just moving my finger slightly causes the swipe right
[13:48:14] <robertmaxrees> becuase you're triggering the event Gsham
[13:48:30] <Gsham> its too sensitive
[13:48:34] <Gsham> how can i make it actually need a longer swipe
[13:48:55] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/18665952/923919
[13:49:12] <qakhan> robertmaxrees i am sorry i did not get you
[13:49:24] <robertmaxrees> qakhan what are you confused about?
[13:50:30] <Gsham> thanks ill try it
[13:52:23] <btracht> i am using an html button with a jquery click function to display external webpage in an html div but need to pass a variable as reference to the external page. ho can this be done?
[13:53:18] <Gsham> hmmm it fine on the computer. but my iphone literally its not a swipe. if you just move your finger the tinies amount it swipes.
[13:53:25] <robertmaxrees> Gsham clear cache
[13:53:32] <robertmaxrees> iphones can be pretty weird about that.
[13:53:48] <qakhan> robertmaxrees  i am trying to save js variable values in php variable
[13:54:01] <robertmaxrees> qakhan you do that via a form.
[13:54:09] <robertmaxrees> and then save it to the user's session that way.
[13:54:53] <robertmaxrees> btracht you can post messages.
[13:56:22] <btracht> robertmaxrees: i think i didn't explain well enough
[13:56:42] <robertmaxrees> sharing data accross iframes is kind of awkward.
[13:56:44] <Gsham> robertmaxrees: still too strong. i dont know why...
[13:56:53] <btracht> my home page has company name. all external pages lookup company info
[13:56:55] <robertmaxrees> Gsham search around on google for into
[13:57:06] <Gsham> i did. i found the same thing u found :)
[13:57:14] <robertmaxrees> that should fix it (shrug)
[13:57:16] <btracht> i need company name ot be passed to each page loaded by clicking button
[13:57:44] <robertmaxrees> in iframes right?
[13:58:04] <btracht> in a different html div
[13:58:12] <btracht> no iframes
[13:58:29] <robertmaxrees> ah, so just via ajax?
[13:58:35] <btracht> yes
[13:58:58] <robertmaxrees> if you're doing ajax gets, you really can only pass data via the querystring.
[13:59:56] <robertmaxrees> unless you're just trying to change the markup getting injected to the page.
[14:00:32] <Gsham> i changed the threshhold to higher and now it seems ok...
[14:00:35] <Gsham> ill have to test android
[14:00:37] <robertmaxrees> Gsham awesome.
[14:00:39] <Gsham> when i ge tmy hands on one
[14:00:55] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty similar to the emulator in chrome.
[14:06:00] <btracht> robertmaxrees: here is the jquery function i am using to load external content
[14:06:04] <btracht> $('#button').click(function() { $("#content").html('<object data="otherContent.php" />'); });
[14:06:37] <robertmaxrees> so when you say "pass a variable" can you clarify?
[14:07:40] <btracht> the original page has variable $company (php). exteranl pages do db query using $company
[14:07:47] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[14:07:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'll need to pass that via a querystring param.
[14:08:05] <btracht> i know i'm not explaing the best. sorry
[14:08:13] <robertmaxrees> and then your backend will check for that qsp and use it if it's there.
[14:08:17] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, backend.
[14:08:33] <robertmaxrees> or you can store all that info in the db still and pass an ID for the site.
[14:14:30] <arnas> hello
[14:14:39] <arnas> may I ask jquery ui questions here?
[14:14:44] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:15:45] <btracht> robertmaxrees: how would that query string be witten in the click function?
[14:16:13] <robertmaxrees> you'd concat it on that data attribute value.
[14:16:28] <arnas> http://pastebin.com/K9yXv549 so I have this jquery ui autocomplete, but whenever I hover over an item, I get this error: "Cannot read property 'value' of undefined
[14:16:28] <arnas>     at e.(anonymous function).(anonymous function).menufocu"
[14:16:37] <robertmaxrees> btracht data="otherContent.php?siteId=" + foo
[14:17:23] <btracht> thank you. i'll ghive it a try
[14:17:42] <robertmaxrees> arnas http://stackoverflow.com/a/13446828/923919
[14:18:16] <arnas> robertmaxrees, yea I saw that one, didn't work
[14:18:41] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  i'd have to see it break arnas
[14:19:32] <arnas> anyone else?
[14:19:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:20:30] <arnas> robertmaxrees, what do you want me to do?
[14:20:44] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete/issues/440
[14:20:49] <robertmaxrees> this suggests it's a data formatting issue.
[14:21:15] <robertmaxrees> lots of info out there.  things can break for all kinds of reasons.
[14:22:25] <arnas> robertmaxrees, I've tried basically all the results in the first page of google, none of them helped
[14:23:11] <robertmaxrees> are you able to make a fiddle without the ajax portion?
[14:23:16] <robertmaxrees> a test case?
[14:23:47] <btracht> robertmaxrees: that worked. so much easier than i was making it. thank you
[14:23:56] <robertmaxrees> btracht definitely.
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> ust be careful that that.
[14:26:59] <arnas> robertmaxrees, hm, it works without that .data() part
[14:27:18] <robertmaxrees> can't see it any more.
[14:27:27] <robertmaxrees> pastebin sucks - it removes things.
[14:27:31] <robertmaxrees> way too fast.
[14:28:31] <arnas> robertmaxrees, I selected it to be removed after 10mins
[14:28:31] <arnas> sec
[14:28:46] <robertmaxrees> heh why not just use bpaste?
[14:28:52] <arnas> robertmaxrees, http://pastebin.com/mUfLDprx
[14:28:52] <robertmaxrees> no ads, more lightweight.
[14:29:01] <arnas> dunno :P
[14:31:33] <robertmaxrees> so that autocomplete call should return a reference to the autocomplete.  why did you add the .data() call in the first place?
[14:32:17] <arnas> robertmaxrees, it's not my code, I am trying to fix it
[14:32:26] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[14:33:21] <arnas> robertmaxrees, I suppose I need to remove that .data and move renderItem inside autoComplete params?
[14:33:31] <robertmaxrees> i would.
[14:34:40] <arnas> robertmaxrees, yup, that worked
[14:34:45] <robertmaxrees> rad
[14:35:21] <arnas> robertmaxrees, but the title isn't added to the li item :(
[14:37:25] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're getting a title back?
[14:37:40] <arnas> robertmaxrees, hm, _renderItem isn't even being called
[14:38:50] <robertmaxrees> using the right version of jqui?
[14:39:51] <arnas> robertmaxrees, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14461787/jqueryui-1-10-0-autocompleter-renderitem-problems
[14:40:03] <arnas> btw, lots of people are using data().renderItem
[14:40:14] <robertmaxrees> i wonder why.
[14:40:59] <arnas> robertmaxrees, version is 1.11.4
[14:47:06] <arnas> robertmaxrees, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37045318/jquery-ui-custom-autocomplete-renderitem-and-rendermenu-not-working this worked, but now it gives me the same error
[14:48:08] <robertmaxrees> dunno at this point.  i'd have to playh with it.  sorry.
[14:50:41] <arnas> :( can anybody help?
[14:51:11] <robertmaxrees> can't make a test case i take it?
[14:51:25] <arnas> robertmaxrees, sec
[14:55:28] <arnas> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/12970/ but it's giving different error :/
[14:56:11] <robertmaxrees> what version of jq are you using in your project?>
[14:56:39] <robertmaxrees> because the edge version isn't necessarily stable.
[14:57:08] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xBB5x/12971/
[14:57:12] <robertmaxrees> this works fine for me.
[14:57:35] <sillyslux> 12971?
[14:57:44] <arnas> robertmaxrees, what have you changed?
[14:57:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:57:51] <robertmaxrees> arnas the version of jquery it's using.
[14:57:54] <robertmaxrees> took it off edge.
[14:59:07] <arnas> robertmaxrees,  jQuery version is 1.11.2 :D
[15:00:21] <arnas> robertmaxrees, I suppose that's really old?
[15:00:27] <robertmaxrees> not super old.
[15:00:38] <robertmaxrees> i might up that to 1.13 and see if that fixes something?
[15:02:35] <arnas> robertmaxrees, what if it breaks something else? :(
[15:04:54] <btracht> robertmaxrees: everything is working with passing the variable in the querystring. but the loaded page/content is displaying in windows about 33% of actual with scroll bars. any thoughts?
[15:08:56] <arnas> robertmaxrees, http://jqueryui.com/download/ there's no 1.13
[15:54:12] <robertmaxrees> back from lunch
[15:54:39] <robertmaxrees> btracht css?
[15:55:41] <GeekMonkey> Can someone help me with a substring error I am getting
[15:55:49] <MassDebates> What's the error?
[15:55:51] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey no need to ask to ask :0
[15:55:56] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question - just ask it :)
[15:56:29] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-Kad37vMy4VpmiTwi8cV
[15:56:47] <GeekMonkey> I am getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'substring' of undefined
[15:56:59] <GeekMonkey> line 4
[15:57:15] <robertmaxrees> means var btnHREF = $(this).attr("href"); returns nothing.
[15:57:45] <robertmaxrees> console.log($(this).attr('href'));
[15:57:51] <robertmaxrees> that'll return undefined there.
[15:58:11] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey ^
[15:58:48] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees why would that return nothing
[15:59:01] <robertmaxrees> maybe the element doesn't have an href attribute.
[15:59:33] <GeekMonkey> it does it is a menu item on the site....
[16:00:07] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're making a bad assumption then :)
[16:00:17] <robertmaxrees> something with that class doesn't have that attribute.
[16:01:34] <robertmaxrees> got a simple example?
[16:01:48] <sillyslux> write an $('.scrollto') to your js-console and see which elements it returns, check them all
[16:02:13] <robertmaxrees> or just try that console log and comment everything else out (shrug)
[16:02:17] <robertmaxrees> see if they all come back defined.
[16:11:27] <btracht> robertmaxrees: i put in a simplified (test) file. it does the same thing
[16:11:36] <robertmaxrees> can you share it?
[16:11:39] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle?
[16:11:53] <robertmaxrees> or something.
[16:12:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah looks like you're supposed to style those with CSS>
[16:19:43] <btracht> robertmaxrees: i am not familiar with posting to fiddle but https://jsfiddle.net/btracht00/ndrcwL6o/
[16:21:14] <robertmaxrees> fwiw object tags can't be self-closing.
[16:21:55] <robertmaxrees> also: you more than likely just need to use CSS to set the width on that container.
[16:22:23] <MassDebates> Excuse me
[16:22:26] <MassDebates> DId someone just say "CSS"?
[16:22:32] <MassDebates> : ) ) ) )
[16:22:36] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:22:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah...?
[16:22:41] <MassDebates> That's a bunch of happy faces togheter
[16:22:55] <robertmaxrees> btracht https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ndrcwL6o/1/
[16:23:16] <robertmaxrees> even though the content doesn't load, notice how the object is just a particular size?
[16:24:00] <robertmaxrees> btracht keep it in channel.
[16:24:02] <robertmaxrees> but see the fiddle?
[16:25:47] <btracht> sorry about the pm
[16:25:50] <btracht> i see
[16:25:51] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[16:26:00] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, just need to set with width/height
[16:27:41] <btracht> is there a way to dynamically set to size of loaded content?
[16:28:10] <robertmaxrees> you can't see inside the embed so it's hard to know the correct width.
[16:29:17] <robertmaxrees> there a reason you're using object tags btw?
[16:29:40] <btracht> nope. better way?
[16:29:51] <robertmaxrees> are you on the same domain?
[16:29:58] <btracht> yes
[16:30:02] <robertmaxrees> ajax it.
[16:31:02] <robertmaxrees> just make sure you're only sending back the snippet you need
[16:31:08] <btracht> can you expand. sorry i'm a noob
[16:31:08] <robertmaxrees> and not an entire page.
[16:31:23] <robertmaxrees> you use $.ajax() to actually pull the content into the page.
[16:31:37] <robertmaxrees> then you can style it etc. like normal content.
[17:19:42] <d2k> hello guys, I have question about CSS: How is the CSS related chat of this community called?
[17:19:53] <robertmaxrees> #css
[17:19:59] <d2k> thank you!
[17:28:03] <Zythyr> Need help. I can't get my animate function to work properly. The delay inbetween the for loop is not working. Can someone please help. https://codepen.io/anon/pen/dNObaW
[17:29:03] <robertmaxrees> where's the animate?
[17:29:51] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're just calling a function.
[17:29:53] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees the onclick function for #buttonAnimate
[17:29:55] <robertmaxrees> not animating anything.
[17:30:15] <Zythyr> It want it to render an image, wait x amount of milliseconds then render the next image
[17:40:29] <robertmaxrees> Zythyr https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p3nvtezg/1/ this is one approach.
[17:40:59] <robertmaxrees> can't really use a for loop for this.
[17:43:31] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees I am super noob to javascript syntax. I come from Python world. lol In this example, what do I need to do? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PWboqd
[17:43:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a recursive function.
[17:43:55] <robertmaxrees> like in my example.
[17:44:11] <robertmaxrees> the issue is for loops don't wait.
[17:44:22] <robertmaxrees> you're just "queueing" a bunch of stuff to happen at x ms after the fact.
[17:45:03] <robertmaxrees> so you want to read one, then set a timeout to call the function again,.
[17:47:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p3nvtezg/3/ with a ternary just because.
[17:51:13] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees I updated. Take a look at the last section of the JS code https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VPmway
[17:51:26] <robertmaxrees> fwiw that's a pretty big test case.
[17:51:48] <robertmaxrees> no for loops./
[17:51:56] <robertmaxrees> for(i=0; i<= max; i++){setTimeout(renderme,2000)}
[17:52:34] <robertmaxrees> literally what that's saying is "for eeach of these numbers, rumn this function after 2000 seconds"
[17:52:38] <robertmaxrees> err, 2000 ms.
[17:52:47] <robertmaxrees> which isn't what you want, becuase they don't add 2000 every time.
[17:52:53] <robertmaxrees> it's also really inefficient.
[17:53:03] <robertmaxrees> because you're making the browser "queue" up all these function calls.
[17:57:24] <jacob144> I'm trying to set a cookie in Jquery but because I'm new to code I don't know what I'm doing. Any one know of some good documentation?
[17:57:36] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do cookies out of the box.
[17:57:42] <jacob144> oh
[17:57:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:57:56] <jacob144> so what do I do then?
[17:58:10] <robertmaxrees> get a plugin or do it manually :)
[17:58:19] <robertmaxrees> i like https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie
[18:01:52] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees I updated again. No more for loop. I did your suggestion, but still not working
[18:02:03] <robertmaxrees> link?
[18:02:43] <jacob144> Which file must I include in my html scripts? js-cookie-master/src/js.cookie.js ?
[18:03:16] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie#direct-download
[18:03:20] <robertmaxrees> tells you right there :)
[18:03:44] <robertmaxrees> ah i see why you're confused.  yes - that's the correct file.
[18:03:54] <jacob144> okay :)
[18:03:54] <robertmaxrees> just download and use it.  no need for the rest of the stuff in there.
[18:04:02] <jacob144> okay
[18:15:33] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees Still no luck. I removed the for loop. I did recurvie loop https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ggLOXZ
[18:16:11] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:16:15] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[18:16:26] <robertmaxrees> see how it locks the browser?
[18:17:29] <jacob144> Hey what can I do to run something when the tab is closed
[18:17:39] <robertmaxrees> you can't reliably.
[18:17:53] <jacob144> Like an alert, or in my case deleting the cookie
[18:18:08] <jacob144> Can I do that with Javascript?
[18:18:25] <robertmaxrees> nope.  once the user's closerd the tab they're also unloading your code.
[18:18:52] <robertmaxrees> Zythyr renderMyImage(i, max, datafiles) not how that works.
[18:19:12] <robertmaxrees> you pass the function object, not the return.
[18:20:35] <robertmaxrees> you can hack that in with renderMyImage.bind(this, i, max, datafiles);
[18:33:55] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[19:49:26] <catbadger> have some questions about promises. anyone got a sec to answer a noob>
[19:49:27] <catbadger> ?
[19:50:03] <shoky> dont ask to ask ;p
[19:51:02] <catbadger> sorry
[19:52:13] <catbadger> I've got an object with named properties holding several promises. I put these into $.when($,arr)/then(function... this fires when the first promise resolves. I need to know when the whole lot are done. should it be a numeric array instead?
[19:54:36] <shoky> should be an array, not a promise, yes
[19:54:38] <shoky> er
[19:54:43] <shoky> an array, not an object, yes
[19:54:44] <catbadger> kthx
[19:54:52] <shoky> and it's $.when.apply($, arr)
[19:56:41] <catbadger> the callback is tacked onto when then
[19:56:46] <catbadger> omg...
[19:56:48] <catbadger> lol
[19:57:11] <catbadger> got it. thank you
[20:34:55] <mindpattern> is it safe to run $(document).ready(); well after a document is ready? will it just instantly run because it’s already ready?
[20:41:26] <cannap> put scripts before </body>
[20:51:23] <shoky> mindpattern: yes
[20:51:38] <mindpattern> shoky: thanks
[20:51:42] <mindpattern> seems to work fine
