[11:06:26] <Miles8of9> Ggggggoooooood morning jquery!!!
[11:18:57] <Miles8of9> is it possible to call a function inside the document ready function? $(function(){ ... });
[11:20:26] <Miles8of9> my form is using the ms unobtrusive ajax script which needs some functions defined for success, failure etc
[11:20:51] <Miles8of9> i can't define such function inside the document ready because it can't find them.. so i need to put them outside
[11:22:01] <Miles8of9> however, if i place them outside i can't call functions that are inside the document ready..!
[11:22:50] <Miles8of9> what i'm trying to achieve is reloading a datatables ajax content when a form is successfully submitted
[12:32:08] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 yeah, you can do that.
[12:32:19] <robertmaxrees> just a scoping issue.
[12:32:53] <Miles8of9> mm how?
[12:33:21] <robertmaxrees> vars defined inside a function are only available within that function.
[12:33:30] <robertmaxrees> as well as all "child" scopes/functions
[12:33:52] <robertmaxrees> a function creates a scope.
[12:34:19] <Miles8of9> i can't initialize the datatables component outside the document ready...
[12:34:30] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:34:38] <Miles8of9> var table = null outside document ready..?
[12:34:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:34:54] <robertmaxrees> can you show some more code for context?
[12:35:32] <Miles8of9> inside $(function(){ i some something like
[12:35:51] <Miles8of9> var table = $('#example').DataTable({ ....
[12:35:54] <robertmaxrees> (paste the code somewhere :) )
[12:36:31] <Miles8of9> it's all there.. after that are config parameters
[12:36:39] <Miles8of9> noting to care about
[12:36:40] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the issue?
[12:37:25] <Miles8of9> unobtrusive ajax requires a function that is *outside* the document ready
[12:37:39] <Miles8of9> if i put it inside it won't see it
[12:37:50] <robertmaxrees> var theFunction = function() {};
[12:37:59] <robertmaxrees> $(theFunction);
[12:39:13] <Miles8of9> ok let's try
[12:42:26] <Miles8of9> i've put the first row inside document ready
[12:42:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:42:54] <robertmaxrees> (i don't know datatables or the ms thing you're using heh)
[12:43:14] <Miles8of9> var table = $('#example').DataTable();
[12:43:20] <Miles8of9> this is inside the document ready
[12:43:31] <Miles8of9> ok??
[12:43:46] <robertmaxrees> i thought you couldn't do things inside the doc ready...??
[12:44:08] <Miles8of9> no... i must put that line inside the doc ready
[12:44:33] <Miles8of9> then i must put this function outside the doc ready
[12:44:53] <Miles8of9> function succeeded(xhr) { $(table).ajax.reload(); }
[12:45:31] <Miles8of9> this is unobtrusive ajax
[12:45:32] <Miles8of9> https://github.com/aspnet/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive
[12:45:42] <Miles8of9> it's a M$ lib for aspnet projects
[12:46:11] <robertmaxrees> is the issue that you aren't able to access 'table' from within the function defined outside of the doc ready?
[12:47:04] <Miles8of9> yes.... table is defined inside and function that accesses it needs to be outside!
[12:47:11] <Miles8of9> https://github.com/aspnet/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive/blob/main/src/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js#L105
[12:47:24] <robertmaxrees> literally none of that you're linking is related to the issue :)
[12:47:47] <robertmaxrees> https://bpa.st/7JUQ
[12:47:51] <robertmaxrees> so you basically have this.
[12:48:13] <robertmaxrees> and the issue is that 'table' doesn't exist outside for the doc ready's scope.  can you modify that function?
[12:48:18] <Miles8of9> no no no no! wait
[12:48:28] <robertmaxrees> 'k please update that bpaste then.
[12:49:18] <Miles8of9> function succeeded(xhr) { $(table).ajax.reload(); }
[12:49:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:49:32] <robertmaxrees> that's the same thing as what i put in that bpaste.
[12:49:36] <robertmaxrees> just declared a different way./
[12:50:00] <Miles8of9> ok... BUT the succeeded is not called from inside the doc ready!
[12:50:11] <robertmaxrees> then update that bpaste to show me what you've got.
[12:50:21] <robertmaxrees> because right now i'm having to guess what you're talking about :)
[12:50:21] <Miles8of9> https://github.com/aspnet/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive/blob/main/src/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js#L105
[12:50:24] <Miles8of9> read here
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:50:36] <robertmaxrees> please just update the fiddle :)
[12:50:48] <robertmaxrees> err bpaste.  instead of making me dump through other stuff.
[12:52:15] <Miles8of9> https://bpa.st/7X5A
[12:52:32] <Miles8of9> unobtrusive ajax script calls the succeeded function
[12:53:01] <Miles8of9> if i put the function INSIDE the doc ready, then it can't find it
[12:53:24] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, so you need to define succeeded in the global scope so it's accessible to the ms thing.
[12:53:32] <Miles8of9> yes!!!!!
[12:53:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're SOL then.
[12:53:57] <Miles8of9> what's SOL?
[12:54:31] <robertmaxrees> shit outta luck.  i guess you could do var succeeded; and then later redclare it in that doc ready but that's a hack.  what you really want to do is move that logic outside of a doc ready in the first place.
[12:54:40] <robertmaxrees> and call the js before the closing body tag.
[12:55:31] <Miles8of9> i don't know what to do -_-
[12:55:51] <robertmaxrees> where did i lose you? :)
[12:56:58] <Miles8of9> datatables needs to stay inside
[12:57:02] <robertmaxrees> why?
[12:57:31] <Miles8of9> because it must run when the page has finished loading
[12:57:49] <Miles8of9> it's some sort of "smart datagrid"...
[12:58:04] <robertmaxrees> document ready doesn't wait for the page to load :)
[12:58:05] <Miles8of9> https://datatables.net/
[12:58:18] <Miles8of9> point 2
[12:58:24] <robertmaxrees> i know what datatables does - just not familiar with the specifics of how to use it.
[12:58:38] <robertmaxrees> but also: just put your code before the closing body tag and you'll be good to go.
[20:55:38] <audiofreeze> SebastianFlyte, hey
