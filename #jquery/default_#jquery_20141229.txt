[00:21:43] <stangeland> How do you guys usually unittest your jquery code?
[00:36:50] <Francis> doug64k sorry for late response
[00:37:21] <Francis> doug64k i want to  bind droppable event to dynamically created nodes?
[00:39:56] <Francis> http://jsfiddle.net/3vt1w9r3/1/
[00:40:06] <Francis> see my fiddle working
[00:41:21] <doug64k> right, you have to actually call droppable on each thing
[00:41:42] <Francis> doug64K yes i call droppable
[00:42:19] <doug64k> stangeland: I use QUni
[00:42:22] <doug64k> QUnit
[00:42:50] <doug64k> it is very simple and has good support for async tests and UI tests
[00:44:05] <doug64k> and no unnecessary bells and whistles or fancy complicated frameworks
[00:44:56] <Francis> doug64k how can i dynamically bind the element with droppable
[00:45:37] <Francis> doug64k will you help
[00:46:15] <doug64k> you do it when you create the dynamically created element
[00:46:28] <doug64k> there is no event-delegation-like way to do it
[00:46:45] <Francis> doug64k ooh not actually
[00:47:12] <doug64k> what?
[00:47:50] <Francis> doug64k yes it's only second level droppable
[00:50:32] <Francis> doug64k go to my fiddle and  drop menu to droppable place (it's work) then drop podcast into menu  (it's work)  drop music or any element into podcast (can't  work)
[00:59:48] <Francis> doug64k are you gonna help me pplease
[01:00:37] <stangeland> doug64k, can i bind that up in an integration server?
[01:31:01] <root3d> is it possible to have redirect page for 405 error, if an api throws 405 , it should be redirected like 404 page ! using jquery/javascript ?
[01:35:58] <inthl> I am really not sure what I am doing wrong, but I am having the issue that .fadeOut() is being called with a complete function, having say e.g. alert("fadeout complete"); -- so once that fadeout is complete, it should print that text ONCE. but it happens that the text is being printed in some kind of loop, all the time. is that a common known problem? what may be the cause there?
[01:38:19] <dannymichel> I'm afraid I'm not much of a developer, but I'm trying to learn. I was wondering if someone could help me figure out what to google for a specific type of 'lightbox(?)' gallery seen here http://goo.gl/L7FLME and here http://goo.gl/bPQZ62 . The thing I like about them is they have diffrent page URLs per image.
[01:38:47] <inthl> the issue might be related to the fact that the $('desiredelement').fadeOut is already on display:none? but that would not explain why it is stuck in that loop
[01:41:01] <Kartagis> dannymichel: there is no *box on the first link
[01:42:24] <dannymichel> Thanks Kartagis. Either way, i'd like to identify what either of them are. Something close maybe. Not exactly sure what to google. The proper terms.
[01:43:39] <Kartagis> dannymichel: try "slideshow modules", no juery here
[01:44:09] <dannymichel> 'slideshow modules different pages' maybe Kartagis?
[01:44:30] <Kartagis> yep
[01:45:07] <dannymichel> Lot of Joomla and drupal stuff coming up
[01:45:23] <root3d> got the answer $(document).ajaxError would do
[01:45:52] <dannymichel> Hmmm, i dunno Kartagis http://goo.gl/QlzYIQ
[01:47:09] <RitterJack> Hello, i have two arrays, i'd like to create a third containing the value present in the two array.
[01:47:15] <RitterJack> is it possible ?*
[01:47:37] <RitterJack> doublon value
[01:50:29] <RitterJack> Hello, i have two arrays, i'd like to create a third containing the value present in the two array.
[01:50:59] <_rgn> var c = uniq(a.concat(c))
[01:54:10] <RitterJack> it will create an array with the dupplicate ?
[01:56:50] <RitterJack>  Is there a way to merge two array and keep only the duplicate value ?
[01:58:01] <_rgn> keep only values that appear more than once?
[01:58:15] <joroci> that appear in both arrays
[01:58:42] <_rgn> check lodash's intersection()
[01:59:16] <Paradisee> how can i make an array of string in js/jquery?
[02:00:08] <joroci> what do you mean array of strings?
[02:01:24] <RitterJack> I have [1,2,3] and [2,4,3] and i'd like to have [2,3]
[02:12:28] <Paradisee> joroci: i mean something like: ['Monday', 'Tue', etc.. etc..]
[02:41:48] <dziegler> Is der an default id of an elment without to set id="foobar"?
[02:42:17] <Zarthus> dziegler: the element name? :P
[02:43:57] <dziegler> My problem is that i need an workaround for the broken bootrap dropdown menu, and inside of the menu i have a form, if i call $.clone() i have two forms with the same id
[02:44:28] <dziegler> so i need to drop the soruce, clone it in my #uglyFixDiv and on hide.bs.dropdown i need to clone the content back to the source div ^^
[02:45:57] <dziegler> but i dont know how to get the source div and i dont want to set a random id the to every element on every of my hundert of html pages
[02:54:04] <IoP_> Are separated script tags guarenteed run sequentially and in correct order but if ajax callbacks might be run simultaneusly with next or later scripts? Am I right?
[02:55:06] <Francis> How do I bind the droppable event to dynamically created nodes?
[02:55:12] <Francis> http://jsfiddle.net/3vt1w9r3/1/
[02:55:26] <Paradisee> how do i make an array full of string? like: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wen', and so on..]
[02:56:46] <IoP_> Francis: that looks familiar. Did you changge your nick and IP?
[02:57:12] <Francis> no
[02:58:07] <Francis> var days:Array = new Array("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat");
[02:59:36] <IoP_> there is still still duplicate ids in <li> tags. Even more familiar code:P
[03:00:13] <Francis> IoP no just see the jquery functionality
[03:01:10] <dziegler> Francis: just write var days = ['foo', 'bar'];
[03:01:25] <Francis> i just want bind the droppable event to dynamically created nodes?
[03:01:54] <dziegler> $(node).droppable(function(){})
[03:02:26] <IoP_> Francis: No. I have seen that code earlier here and I have seen tips given here being ignored by (your) other nicks. I won't waste my time. Others might and it's sad.
[03:02:30] <Francis> dziegler $(node).droppable(function(){}) use same one
[03:03:10] <Francis> http://jsfiddle.net/3vt1w9r3/1/
[03:05:57] <dziegler> Francis: one moment
[03:14:31] <Francis> dziegler
[03:15:19] <dziegler> Francis: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=QOdSrPsfhN may be not the smartest way but work
[03:17:27] <dziegler> Francis: can you run it?
[03:17:44] <Francis> dziegler yes but not what i want
[03:18:14] <dziegler> so this creates an element and make it droppable
[03:18:46] <Francis> dziegler see my fiddle
[03:19:24] <Francis> Go to my fiddle and drop menu to droppable place (it's work) then drop podcast into menu (it's work) drop music or any element into podcast (can't work)
[03:20:07] <CssNoob> Hi
[03:21:03] <dziegler> Francis: dont get it can can drop menu, podcast and music to the drop zone

[03:40:09] <IoP_> If I want to run qunit(for "production/example page) how can I make sure that all ajax requests are completed? Should I use plugins' callbacks or ajaxStop() or something else to start testing?

[04:43:36] <Paradisee> solved

[04:46:35] <Paradisee> :O

[04:46:57] <Hypfer> hello, I need to access the DOM of a cross site Iframe
[04:47:05] <Hypfer> is there any way how I could do that?
[04:47:18] <Hypfer> I need to extract information out of a table inside that iframe
[04:47:27] <gannicus555> Is there any way I can ajax to a router on a different domain ( e.g 192.168.1.1) , I tried using the JasonP and got passed the sameOrigin policy , but the server does not reply to the jasonP
[04:48:15] <gannicus555> I saw something being applied on defcon and im trying to replicate , but I dunno how they passed the same origin policy
[04:50:26] <Paradisee> what do you mean by "Is there any way I can ajax to a router"
[04:51:11] <gannicus555> paradisee?
[04:53:04] <gannicus555> I want to get the status page of my router, there is no login, but I can't view the data I retrieve
[05:03:18] <Fasmac> http://jsfiddle.net/1emno21d/2/
[05:03:23] <Fasmac> helllo guys!!
[05:04:06] <Fasmac> Someone know how can I to set a value with the formSubmitting option
[05:04:18] <Fasmac> This is jtable jquery plugin!
[05:19:45] <Fasmac> I'm getting this error :: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data
[05:19:52] <Fasmac> someone know why?
[05:25:47] <arthurvr> that's because your json is invalid
[05:25:56] <arthurvr> already at the first character
[05:26:16] <arthurvr> I bet your server isn't returning json just
[05:26:29] <arthurvr> maybe a html-syntaxed error message from your server?
[05:26:37] <arthurvr> Fasmac ^
[05:27:04] <Fasmac> now I have this ::: newvar = $(iframeContents).serialize();         var result = $.parseJSON(newvar);
[05:27:26] <Fasmac> but show me that data is null
[05:27:31] <arthurvr> yeah but serialize() doesn't create json
[05:27:52] <arthurvr> JSON.stringify() creates json formatted objects
[05:27:54] <arthurvr> not serialize()
[05:28:19] <Fasmac> http://jsfiddle.net/0o6dst4o/
[05:28:26] <Fasmac> this is my script!
[05:28:59] <arthurvr> don't have the time to look over it man
[05:29:07] <arthurvr> but look over what I said before
[05:29:19] <arthurvr> what you posted in here at least wouldn't work becuase of that reason
[05:30:16] <sacho_> Fasmac, try using serializeArray()
[05:30:37] <sacho_> without the .parseJSON() part.
[05:35:50] <troop> hi, http://pastebin.com/BizAYJ2z this code does not alert. why, i dont know. i cannot solve it.
[05:37:17] <bourg_i> Hi, I have some trouble with jquery and IE9, I have this code that works on chrome, firefox and IE10+ but on IE9 only the first line works but I don't have any error in the Console (IE9 console ...). Here my code : https://gist.github.com/bourg-ismael/79edd53a2ddb492b03c2
[06:09:01] <Hypfer> I have a large table
[06:09:22] <Hypfer> and when I do .find("tr") i jsut get jquery.fn.init[]
[06:09:30] <Hypfer> and the count of the found trs
[06:12:16] <hamster88> hello
[06:12:20] <hamster88> i have a question
[06:12:29] <hamster88> has anyo of you used jquery jslider?
[06:12:33] <Paradisee> how can i change the value when it changes in a json file? http://jsfiddle.net/1us5n3pu/15/
[06:12:41] <Paradisee> hamster88: iam actually
[06:13:02] <hamster88> Paradisee, thank god got someone who is using it xD
[06:13:30] <Paradisee> well, im a python programmer, not a fan of js
[06:14:02] <hamster88> but js comes and pokes us every now and then tho haha
[06:14:15] <Paradisee> depends on your applications
[06:14:26] <Paradisee> i usually just make programs for the console
[06:16:48] <hamster88> anyways i have defined <section> which have <ul with class name "slide" > and i am not sure how to proceed with the setup of that bxslider thing
[06:17:39] <Paradisee> copy paste my fiddle
[06:18:20] <hamster88> here is my codepen > http://codepen.io/hamster88/pen/raMPjX
[06:21:52] <Hypfer> fuck jquery
[06:21:58] <Hypfer> I select an element and it returns
[06:21:59] <Hypfer> a counter
[06:22:03] <hamster88> lol
[06:22:05] <arthurvr> lol
[06:22:14] <arthurvr> jsfiddle and we'il figure it out
[06:22:18] <Hypfer> i don't care which COUNT that element is
[06:22:51] <Hypfer> https://www.gfk-e.com/charts/index.php?idcat=12 <-- that page. I just want to iterate over the main table and generate a json from it
[06:23:12] <joroci> what do you need from it?
[06:23:15] <joroci> everything?
[06:23:47] <Hypfer> title, artist and the chart position
[06:25:08] <joroci> chart position is platz ?
[06:25:34] <Hypfer> exactly
[06:25:46] <joroci> paste what you got by now
[06:27:12] <Paradisee> how can i change the value when it changes in a json file? http://jsfiddle.net/1us5n3pu/15/
[06:27:51] <Hypfer> joroci: $("table [cellpadding='2'] tr")
[06:27:51] <Hypfer> jQuery.fn.init[109]
[06:28:00] <Hypfer> (second is what I get back)
[06:30:53] <joroci> i'm getting the first row
[06:31:35] <Hypfer> joroci: did you load jquery? because the page doesn't contain it
[06:31:54] <Hypfer> I used a bookmarklet found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9624972/command-for-loading-jquery-on-google-chrome-inspector
[06:32:04] <Hypfer> you'll need to edit the url so it loads over https
[06:34:37] <joroci> good so you are getting all the rows now you need to loop through them and get the data you want
[06:35:03] <Hypfer> joroci: yeah but that doesn't work :/
[06:35:08] <Mark_2> does anyone know what kind of navigation this is, and where i can get it? ksostudio.com/respon/flat_home_boxrespo
[06:35:53] <Hypfer> joroci: $("table [cellpadding='2'] tr").each(function(foo){console.log(foo)}) this returns only numbers
[06:37:35] <Mark_2> oops sorry http://ksostudio.com/respon/flat_home_box
[06:41:02] <Hypfer> joroci: do you get the same result?
[06:42:38] <MetalHead77> anyone here ever used pubnub  before?
[06:50:11] <Hypfer> okay, so here's the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/9vakqguL/
[06:50:27] <Hypfer> run it and look into the console. why the heck are numbers there?!
[06:51:12] <_DB> if I want to check that a data.object from a ajax request is set would I use val()
[06:51:29] <_DB> the data element is a array
[06:55:01] <hamster88> i did it :D
[07:04:32] <joroci> Hypfer because each has 2 parameters index and element
[07:04:35] <joroci> first one is index
[07:04:41] <Hypfer> joroci: so I'm just being retarded? oh well :)
[07:05:29] <jaakey> not really, in vanilla JS the iterator callbacks get (element, index, array) and in jquery they're (index, element, array)
[07:05:32] <jaakey> which is stupid.
[07:07:21] <Hypfer> jaakey: wow thats stupid
[07:07:49] <jaakey> you'll have to wait till one of the gurus gets here and can explain it to us
[07:08:39] <Hypfer> #define TRUE FALSE //Happy debugging suckers
[07:14:22] <MikeD_> I had a recursive function building DOM... it was taking longer to finish than I liked, so I put some of the calls inside that function into setTimeout() - it worked exactly as I hoped it would.  However, the assumption that all child nodes would exist at the end of the calling routine is no longer true
[07:17:45] <blackkbot> don't use recursion to loop use a loop if you can
[07:18:30] <MikeD_> yeah, though the issue would remain - the timing even with loopy code instead of recursive code
[07:18:37] <snover> use a promise
[07:18:59] <mvpgraff> How can
[07:19:11] <mvpgraff> How can I have the last slide on Orbit Slider from Foundation show up first?
[07:19:37] <MikeD_> i only sort-of understand how to use a promise
[07:20:22] <MikeD_> trivial examples are trivial (of course) - but I'm not sure how to implement with an arbitrary builder and still know something is ready
[07:24:07] <MikeD_> meh - i think the whole mess boils down to "you're doing it wrong"
[07:24:51] <pdcmoreira> you guys know jQuery-Knob?
[07:25:14] <snover> MikeD_: https://gist.github.com/csnover/5e47932251bdf88bed83
[07:25:20] <BillCriswell> mvpgraff: Without looking at the Orbit Slider documenation you can just move the last slide to the first position before initializing the slider.
[07:25:32] <snover> well, probably, if you are creating a structure so massive that you have to yield in order to ensure performance is ok
[07:25:37] <blackkbot> how about you just translate it into html and then get the browser to parse it?
[07:26:31] <BillCriswell> mvpgraff: Yeah. I don't see a reverse option or an order option so you can do like.. $('.slider .slide').last().prepend('.slider');
[07:26:37] <MikeD_> snover: thanks
[07:27:09] <mvpgraff> Yea, I was trying to do something like that, but found a link that works with the foundation js
[07:27:10] <BillCriswell> prependTo('.slider') *
[07:27:34] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[07:27:42] <mvpgraff> And they don't have how to change the first slider visible in the documentation.
[07:28:04] <blackkbot> you are putting your recursive stuff outside of the loop and if you are using setTimeout you need to have it at the end of the setTimeouts for the elements that exist... have we worked past this
[07:28:04] <blackkbot> ?
[07:28:04] <mvpgraff> Thanks though, hopefully it works, it's from Zurb in a blog of theirs.
[07:28:42] <mvpgraff> http://zurb.com/university/lessons/19
[07:28:49] <mvpgraff> Just in case anybody wants to refer to it later.
[07:29:37] <BillCriswell> mvpgraff: Oh, that would prbably be better. Do you want to actually reorder or just start at the end?
[07:29:39] <MikeD_> blackkbot: no, i'm still working on it
[07:29:53] <mvpgraff> I just want to start at the end
[07:31:02] <BillCriswell> Oh, then that __goto would be my approach.
[07:31:42] <blackkbot> starting at the end isn't the way to do it.. that like reading the last page of a book to start the book
[07:32:05] <blackkbot> idk  what you are starting at the end so don't bother correcting me
[07:32:25] <mvpgraff> :P
[07:32:33] <mvpgraff> My main product slide got pushed to the end due to new slides
[07:34:00] <BillCriswell> How come you don't have easier say over the order of this?
[07:34:15] <mvpgraff> Wordpress.
[07:36:44] <mvpgraff> I'm just using it as a small content slider for featured posts/products, I tried to make the last slide the active slide, but the foundation scripts override it and force the first slide one to be active.
[07:38:36] <blackkbot> hunh?
[07:38:49] <blackkbot> the slides are supposed to be out of order?
[07:39:03] <blackkbot> is it an array of slides?
[07:39:32] <mvpgraff> Nah, they're correct based on the logic of the script, but I just wanted to change the default slide. Since the first <li> is always the default
[07:40:14] <BillCriswell> $('.orbit > li').last().prependTo('.orbit'); then init the slider.
[07:43:13] <mvpgraff> There's a few ways to do it now that I looked into it 1) Your way Bill, 2) Zurbs way, 3) Change post date <-- Not what I want
[07:43:49] <mvpgraff> But I like your solution BillCriswell, since I don't have to change the core of foundation
[07:44:48] <blackkbot> $('li:not(li:last-child)').each(function(){ $(this).parent.appendChild($(this))})
[07:45:38] <blackkbot> mixed the dom and jquery too much tehre
[07:45:48] <blackkbot> i didn't put the right names for anything  bet
[07:47:51] <jaakey> I think you can do li:not(:last-child) right?
[07:49:26] <snover> MikeD_: please keep all questions in the chat so other people can help and learn
[07:50:16] <blackkbot> idk if its right
[07:50:44] <blackkbot> no its right
[07:50:47] <blackkbot>  li:not(:last-child) works
[07:52:30] <blackkbot> parentElement would be the dom reference for the parentElement  or append instead of appendChild for jquery
[07:55:21] <reynierpm> hi there which is the right way to get data-* attr? I am working on this http://jsbin.com/xanucuyiso/1/edit?js,console,output but I get not output from data-* any advice?
[07:56:43] <reynierpm> nevermind, I was doing something wrong at my code
[07:56:46] <reynierpm> thx anyway
[07:58:59] <BillCriswell> blackkbot: Think you'd want to do .parent().append(this) for jquerized whatever.
[08:00:10] <MikeD_> snover, I added console.log() to the example and made it a fiddle... not what I expected: http://jsfiddle.net/wqvsygjx/1/
[08:00:55] <Juslintek> Hi, can someone tell me why custom-top.js script is not working on firefox and IE? http://www.rebels.lt/
[08:01:52] <Juslintek> I wrote it should resize third level submenu
[08:01:58] <Juslintek> but it only works on chrome
[08:11:07] <MikeD_> nevermind, I give up.
[08:11:14] <Juslintek> Hey, any interbrowser experts?
[08:11:50] <MikeD_> imho, Promises should be built in from the start, not retrofitted.
[08:14:52] <Juslintek> Why firefox is not listenint to .width and .css?
[08:14:58] <Juslintek> listening*
[08:15:59] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: I have no idea what's going on here.
[08:16:16] <BillCriswell> What third level submenus?
[08:16:27] <Juslintek> BillCriswell, open same address with Chrome and Firefox (http://rebels.lt)
[08:16:40] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:16:48] <Juslintek> in the source head you can find script, custom-top.js
[08:16:53] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:17:26] <BillCriswell> It feels like you're doing CSS in your Javascript.
[08:17:30] <Juslintek> It loads jQuery script which should resize the menu items
[08:17:40] <Juslintek> I'm doing dynamic css in jquery
[08:18:07] * wa5ted facepalms
[08:18:12] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: That just sounds wrong.
[08:18:22] <Juslintek> thing is firefox and IE is not loading it as Chrome, the first and second menu item is loading wrong
[08:18:24] <BillCriswell> I can see using it for one small adjustment but there's a lot going on here.
[08:18:41] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: It looks the same in Chrome and IE to me.. at least what I think I Should be looking at.
[08:19:02] <Juslintek> Well jquery can set precice values, you can't perform maths on css in real time like on jquery
[08:19:24] <Juslintek> BillCriswell look at menu items
[08:19:42] <Juslintek> second and third are three levels deep
[08:19:52] <BillCriswell> I don't see anything here that would require anything more than percentage based widths.
[08:20:00] <Juslintek> I enable on them special class which changes the way it looks
[08:20:19] <Juslintek> BillCriswell, that is the thing, jquery is not putting precentage
[08:20:31] <Juslintek> there can be 5 columns or 10
[08:20:38] <Juslintek> all items must fit into one row
[08:20:49] <wa5ted> Juslintek: sounds like you need a grid
[08:21:08] <BillCriswell> I'm saying you should be able to just put the percentages in CSS.
[08:21:21] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: In any case though. I'm not seeing it work in Chrome or Firefox.
[08:21:28] <Juslintek> BillCriswell, then the items which belong on first row, will go to next one.
[08:21:45] <Juslintek> I need to set percentage based on container width and li it has
[08:22:18] <Juslintek> and that is what I'm doing, but ff and IE is not allowing DOM to take widths and margins I'm ordering them to get.
[08:22:44] <Juslintek> While on Chrome in source you can see inline widths and margins are present
[08:22:52] <Juslintek> while on ff and ie they aren't
[08:22:53] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: Fair enough. There's still way too much going on in this JS.
[08:23:39] <BillCriswell> Juslintek: Im not seeing anything different between Chrome and Firefox, though.
[08:23:46] <Juslintek> I see your point there is too much going on in that function... :-D
[08:24:09] <Juslintek> I should use those vars externally and probably pass their values to function
[08:24:19] <Juslintek> or reference them
[08:25:05] <Juslintek> hover over Struktūra ir kontaktai in Chrome then in FF
[08:25:24] <Juslintek> 6 columns fit into one row in Chrime, and in FF they don't
[08:25:41] <Juslintek> because on FF blocks are too wide
[08:25:55] <Juslintek> or should I say list items
[08:26:09] <Juslintek> with display:block; property.
[08:26:42] <Mihkkal_> Can anyone tell me what I would need to do to validate an input with a miner address in a format like this (stratum+tcp://doge.anonmining.com:3336) I've been using http://formvalidation.io for my other forms, but I am a bit stuck here
[08:28:48] <BillCris_> Juslintek: There's too much going on here. Can't help unless it's narrowed down a bit and it only displaying on hover is maddening.
[08:30:18] <Juslintek> can you tell why on function windowResize this is not working?                     $(this).find("ul").each(function() {
[08:30:18] <Juslintek>                         $(this).width(getListWidth);
[08:30:18] <Juslintek>                         $(this).css('margin-right', getListRightMargin);
[08:30:18] <Juslintek>                     });
[08:30:52] <Juslintek> or this:                 subMenuSelector.first().css('margin-left', 15);
[08:30:53] <Juslintek>                 subMenuSelector.each(function(){
[08:30:53] <Juslintek>                     $(this).width(getListWidth);
[08:30:53] <Juslintek>                     $(this).css('margin-right', getListRightMargin); }
[08:31:31] <BillCris_> Assuming you set the listener up properly and those functions are returning the right numbers it seems like it should be working.
[08:31:35] <Juslintek> calculation are pretty basic over there, but I prefer to name each values, so I would remember where is what.
[08:31:53] <Juslintek> On chrome it is
[08:31:54] <Juslintek> on ff it isn't
[08:32:13] <BillCris_> Yeah, I've never run into a resize event in Chrome not happening.
[08:32:13] <Juslintek> main question why.
[08:32:39] <BillCris_> but make sure that's the case. Put a console.log() in the resize event and make sure that's the issue.
[08:33:20] <Juslintek> Thing is all values are right, all arrays are right.
[08:33:33] <Juslintek> On ff the each event is not performing right.
[08:33:46] <Juslintek> i mean each function
[08:37:18] <ThoMe> guckguck
[08:37:39] <_DB> sup guys im getting this weird error
[08:37:56] <_DB> GET http://manager.dev/css/bootstrap/bootstrap.css.map 404 (Not Found)
[08:37:58] <ThoMe> have a click event like $('.changeGroup').click(function () { ... i create many table rows dynamic with ajax. but the click event doesnt works when i dynamic create the table rows.
[08:38:09] <ThoMe> is a other solution posible? live() ?
[08:38:09] <_DB> when I click the error in the console it take me to another window
[08:39:05] <_DB> it takes em to this error <script src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true" type="text/javascript"></script>
[08:39:55] <BillCris_> _DB: It's just chrome looking for a source map.
[08:40:03] <BillCris_> The request won't be made unless you have dev tools open.
[08:40:24] <_DB> what does that mean? how can I fix it?
[08:43:01] <BillCris_> In boostrap.css remove the bottom comment.
[08:43:18] <BillCris_> /*# sourceMappingURL=bootstrap.css.map */ something like this.
[08:44:29] <_DB> what should I set it to #sourceMappingURL=bootstrap.css.map ?
[08:44:38] <_DB> i removed the /*    */
[08:44:51] <_DB> the map still doesnt show up but the error is gone
[08:44:51] <BillCris_> Just remove it completely.
[08:45:06] <BillCris_> Do you want the source map to be used?
[08:45:16] <_DB> well im trying to show a map
[08:45:19] <_DB> on the contact page
[08:45:37] <_DB> never used the plugin before (im using one that came with a bootstrap template)
[08:46:08] <BillCris_> I don't htink we're talking about the same map.
[08:46:29] <_DB> probably not lol im trying to show a google map
[08:46:36] <_DB> of a lat and long
[08:46:37] <BillCris_> Yeah, totally unrelated.
[08:46:48] <_DB> ahh ok
[08:46:55] <_DB> well that error stopped showing up so thanks
[08:47:00] <BillCris_> Removing the bottom comment of bootstrap.css will remove the 404 you were worried about haha.
[08:47:02] <BillCris_> No problem.
[08:47:08] <_DB> ill see why the map isnt loading
[08:47:43] <BillCris_> Me either.
[09:33:55] <xpheres> hi
[09:34:08] <Sal> hi
[09:34:21] <xpheres> I have a problem with jquery, I'm trying to send a textarea with get and it doesn't work while the input text works
[09:34:27] <xpheres> does anyone knows why?
[09:34:31] <Sal> if i get an element by its id, why do i need to include the [0] after it?
[09:34:42] <robertmaxrees> Sal you don't unless you're running native DOM methods.
[09:34:49] <robertmaxrees> xpheres any console or network errors?
[09:34:59] <xpheres> no
[09:35:04] <xpheres> I ll show you the code
[09:35:08] <robertmaxrees> thanks.
[09:35:20] <Sal> robertmaxrees, why does this $('#sb')[0] have to be equale to this document.getElementById('sb')
[09:35:25] <xpheres> http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/jquery/contact_me.js
[09:35:34] <robertmaxrees> because jQuery always returns a collection.
[09:35:44] <Sal> doesn't $('#sb') be just good because i'm using unique id
[09:35:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:35:55] <Sal> oh
[09:35:55] <robertmaxrees> because it's still returning a collection.
[09:36:01] <xpheres> var message = $("input#message").val();
[09:36:04] <Sal> didn't know that!
[09:36:06] <Sal> damn
[09:36:11] <robertmaxrees> it's just a collection of one - that's what allows you to run jquery methods against it.
[09:36:11] <xpheres> this is what does not work
[09:36:17] <Sal> this means i have to see all my code now
[09:36:21] <Sal> :(
[09:36:30] <xpheres> message is a text area
[09:36:36] <xpheres> If I put an input it works
[09:36:38] <xpheres> why?
[09:37:00] <robertmaxrees> xpheres didn't you say it's a textarea element?
[09:37:05] <xpheres> yes
[09:37:07] <xpheres> I mean
[09:37:17] <xpheres> if I change the textarea for a single row input
[09:37:19] <xpheres> it works
[09:37:23] <robertmaxrees> then var message = $("input#message").val(); won't work for a textarea.
[09:37:27] <xpheres> in the html
[09:37:29] <robertmaxrees> just do var message = $("#message").val();
[09:37:33] <xpheres> right
[09:37:39] <robertmaxrees> don't prepend ID selectors with tags.
[09:37:40] <xpheres> let me check it
[09:37:54] <robertmaxrees> it's actually slower to do it that way.
[09:39:56] <robertmaxrees> xpheres $('input#message') is looking for <input id="message"> - you have <textarea id="message">.  just select on #message since IDs are unique.
[09:40:56] <xpheres> thanks robertmaxrees
[09:40:59] <xpheres> now it works!
[09:41:03] <xpheres> you solved my problem!
[09:41:05] <xpheres> thank you!
[09:41:22] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:42:18] <xpheres> Im testing it now
[09:42:23] <xpheres> what a silly problem
[09:43:29] <robertmaxrees> sometimes you just need a rubber duck
[10:24:33] <t4nk251> Hi, does anyone know or has a good form validation library for jQuery which I can use? I have been trying to make one myself which validates onfocusout & onsubmit but I cannot make a proper validation script..
[10:25:09] <t4nk251> I'd be glad to hear if any got something like this which I can adjust
[10:26:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery validate is decent http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[10:31:49] <t4nk251> robertmaxrees: I tried with that, but I am using bootstrap as css to style it. jQuery validate does other style methods to validate
[10:31:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:31:54] <robertmaxrees> you can apply your own styles.
[11:10:13] <Fasmac> hello guys!!
[11:10:40] <mbrzuzy> hey
[11:11:02] <Fasmac> I'm working with jtable and one row is an image which on hover event show some dynamic image throught tooltipster plugin
[11:11:25] <Fasmac> all works ok but the only problem is the last column doens't works
[12:27:46] <Laban> If I do: var journalEntry = $.Mustache.render('journalPost', posts[i]); var target = $(".journal").append(journalEntry);  Why won't target.append(...) add any new tags I add?
[12:29:05] <BillCriswell> Laban: Are you trying to add to .journal or something in journalEntry?
[12:29:10] <Laban> I pass target to a function that fetches comments from a JSON request, in which I do target.append(commentTag)
[12:29:54] <Laban> The journalEntry is appended just fine to ".journal", but I'd like to append to the journalEntry.
[12:30:27] <robertmaxrees> Laban your target var would be the .journal
[12:30:41] <BillCriswell> Laban: You'd need to do like.. target.find('.something-in-journal-entry').append('foo')
[12:30:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9j8thfqw/
[12:31:28] <BillCriswell> Though, might be easier to do like... var $journalEntry = $(journalEntry); $journalEntry.append('Whatever'); $journalEntry.appendTo(target);
[12:31:40] <robertmaxrees> agreed.  that would make more sense imo.

[12:32:02] <BillCriswell> Besides making me feel old, I love that ad.
[12:33:31] <robertmaxrees> that's amazing
[12:34:08] <Laban> Awesome ad
[12:34:16] <BillCriswell> I may remember every single frame of that game.
[12:35:07] <Laban> BillCriswell: I don't want to do the target.find('.something-in-journal-entry').append('foo') because then I need each journal entry to have unique class or something.
[12:35:25] <Laban> But appendTo might help..
[12:36:01] <BillCriswell> Laban: Yeah. I'd do what I need before appending.
[12:36:28] <Laban> Can't do that, since it's asynchronous.
[12:37:28] <Laban> First the journal entries are appended async, then my issue is how to load the comments on the respective journal, async.
[12:38:28] <BillCriswell> Sounds messy haha
[12:38:30] <Laban> Which is why I want to append the journal, but keep a reference to it in a var, and pass that to the next async request so that it can be used to append comments.
[12:38:39] <Laban> BillCriswell: Very! :D
[12:39:08] <Laban> But it will allow me to have the same comments function on a bunch of different places.
[12:39:22] <Laban> Instead of just loading comments in the journal JSON.
[12:41:37] <BillCriswell> Laban: How are you figuring out how to get the comments? Is it based on something on the element?
[12:42:30] <BillCriswell> on the journalEntry *
[12:46:32] <Laban> In the journals JSON-data there's an ID, which I pass to getComments.
[12:46:47] <Laban> function getComments(target, type, postId, lastPost, maxPosts) { ... }
[12:50:55] <BillCriswell> ok

[13:32:06] <disgrntld> Hello, I have a promise question about shallow resources, cars and tires, where a car is composed of tires. If I represent the creation of a car with tires as a promise chain (a promise to save the car piped to a when promis to update the fk of each tire with the new car id), what's stopping a user from closing their browser half-way through the chain's execution? Wouldn't that leave a car saved on the server without its tires?
[13:34:20] <disgrntld> Do I change the server to accept nested resources or leave the resources shallow and add a promise to the end of the chain to set a "complete" flag on the car?

[14:03:14] <helge> say I have more than one sortable table on a page, how do I specify the data being posted that it's only from the table which I have been sorting?
[14:03:17] <helge> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27676904/sort-table-drag-and-drop-style-and-save-new-order
[14:03:47] <helge> the 'this' function on a table.
[14:04:35] <robertmaxrees> the `this` is an object, not a function.
[14:05:13] <helge> the problem with the code i'm referring to in the link is that is passes all the id's from the <tr's via post command
[14:05:28] <helge> I only need the id's from the <tr's within the table I am sorting.
[14:06:04] <robertmaxrees> right -that code should do that.
[14:07:15] <robertmaxrees> at least, that code will get you the relevant IDs.
[14:07:39] <helge> yes, but at the page I have several tables
[14:07:51] <robertmaxrees> right - that code should work with multiple tables.
[14:08:22] <robertmaxrees> and only return the one you changed.
[14:08:41] <helge> no. it returns an array with all ids from all tables.
[14:08:49] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ helge

[14:12:17] <_DB> some sort of an array?
[14:12:23] <robertmaxrees> helge the issue is the ids variable is being set wrong.

[14:16:22] <shazam3r> what robertmaxrees ?
[14:16:31] <helge> robertmaxrees: you added $(item).closest ... what does it do? choose the table I'm altering?
[14:16:32] <robertmaxrees> weird it's back now.
[14:16:59] <robertmaxrees> helge the item object is the thing you're interacting with.  .closest() goes up until it finds whatever is in the selector.
[14:18:36] <robertmaxrees> shazam3r because the keypress logic happens before the character has been entered.

[15:05:04] <popl> I'm doing «$('.menu-item').click( function() { console.log( $(this).text() ); } );» but the console is displaying inconsistent text (i.e. sometimes the text will be for a different menu item).

[15:08:27] <popl> I have a conundrum. The HTML page is rather large and loads several different $boss-rolled js libraries. I'm not sure if I can pare it down to a test case or not.
[15:08:38] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:08:45] <robertmaxrees> should be trivial.
[15:08:56] <popl> the test case should be trivial?
[15:09:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah - just need the html of the nav.
[15:09:15] <popl> okay
[15:32:18] <popl> robertmaxrees: I think I'll have to figure this one out myself. Thanks anyways.
[15:32:39] <codecutter> does it matter if a data attribute has "_ "instead of "-" ?
[15:32:53] <andrewhood125> Hello all. I'm trying to perform an ajax call to an api that returns an array. I want to process that array and end up with an array of the processed results. I'm not great with JS could someone nudge me in the right direction? This is what I've got so far. http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=8NPmmw321O
[15:33:10] <codecutter> will jquery data functions work in either case?
[15:35:11] <popl> andrewhood125: What's the problem you're having?
[15:36:22] <andrewhood125> popl: I'm calling .done() off of $.ajax() but I want to process the results and add them to the containing function/obj.
[15:36:44] <andrewhood125> I'm not sure how to add the array as a property of the object.
[15:37:08] <Paradisee> how can i store a json object in a var globally ?
[15:38:13] <robertmaxrees> codebrainz you can use _, but the names are camelcased instead.
[15:38:15] <popl> andrewhood125: like you'd add any other property
[15:38:20] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee by declaring it globally.
[15:38:33] <popl> andrewhood125: or do you want to add the individual elements instead of the whole array?
[15:38:39] <Paradisee> funny
[15:38:58] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee (shrug) that's how you'd do it.
[15:39:37] <andrewhood125> popl: I get back an array from GitHub, I want to process that data and add the processed data as a property of the object. I updated the jsfiddle. I'm not sure if this is the best way to go about doing this.
[15:39:41] <popl> andrewhood125: I'm not sure what you want to do. normally you'd just do something like «var results = JSON.parse(ajax_thing());»
[15:39:52] <popl> okay, I'll look.
[15:41:24] <andrewhood125> popl: Thanks
[15:56:03] <ZionZee> need some help
[15:56:35] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ ZionZee
[15:56:35] <b-ot> ZionZee: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:57:16] <ZionZee> ajax 304 error code
[15:57:20] <ZionZee> what is that?
[15:57:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not an error.
[15:57:37] <robertmaxrees> that's "not modified"
[15:57:59] <ZionZee> then how to be modified?
[15:58:46] <ZionZee> whenever i press a vote button in django it appear nothing nv +1
[15:58:58] <robertmaxrees> either modify your server to always serve up the newest copy of that resource or turn on cachebusting in ajax.
[15:59:15] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ - check out the "cache" option
[16:01:11] <ZionZee> where to paste this query.ajax command?
[16:01:21] <robertmaxrees> how are you currently using it?
[16:02:09] <ZionZee> currently i store the ajax commands in a ajax.js
[16:02:21] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ ZionZee
[16:02:21] <b-ot> ZionZee: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:07:21] <andrewhood125> popl: Whoops, disconnected. What do you think?
[16:08:17] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/zionzee/cpwhsz6p
[16:08:49] <ZionZee> sorry
[16:08:55] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/zionzee/cpwhsz6p/2/
[16:09:38] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee you'd have to convert that $.get() call to use $.ajax()
[16:09:56] <popl> andrewhood125: you've got a typo
[16:10:11] <popl> s/readble/readable/
[16:10:33] <ZionZee> which want?
[16:10:42] <ZionZee> why u get the $.get()
[16:11:02] <andrewhood125> popl: Thanks. I forgot to update that. When I console.log(gh) gh.events is still null.
[16:11:23] <andrewhood125> popl: I've been looking into http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/ and maybe that's a better way to go.
[16:11:31] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee you need to set cache: false for that ajax call.  use $.ajax() to do it instead.
[16:11:34] <robertmaxrees> very easy to do.
[16:12:03] <andrewhood125> popl: I just want to expose an interface that is very east to use. i.e. var gh = new GitHubActivityFeed("andrewhood125"); and have everything handled internally.
[16:12:16] <andrewhood125> popl: I'll get there eventually.
[16:13:07] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cpwhsz6p/3/
[16:13:11] <robertmaxrees> it'll look something like this.
[16:13:17] <popl> andrewhood125: Have you tried just getting the json from github first before trying to stuff it into the object?
[16:13:20] <robertmaxrees> also, when dealing with data attributes, use .data(), not .attr() or .prop()
[16:13:53] <andrewhood125> popl: Like pulling $.ajax outside of `function GithubActivityFeed()`?
[16:16:15] <popl> andrewhood125: Yeah, try to connect to github first to make sure it's not a problem somewhere else.
[16:17:04] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: weird it still won't update my database and the website with +1
[16:17:17] <popl> andrewhood125: you might think about setting an error callback too
[16:17:22] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee what happens when you hit the URL directly, no ajax?
[16:17:34] <andrewhood125> popl: I gotcha, what would my success: function(data) { // how to return object? }
[16:17:37] <popl> andrewhood125: That way you can define what happens if it blows up
[16:17:41] <andrewhood125> popl: Yeah that's in the works :)
[16:17:58] <popl> I'd do that first, because it's more likely that I'd screw something up initially.
[16:19:20] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: you mean /url/like_question/
[16:19:32] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee yes - the url you're trying to run ajax against.
[16:19:54] <popl> oh wow, .success was deprecated in 1.8
[16:20:03] <andrewhood125> popl: Thanks for your help. I'm gonna do some reading and see if I can hammer it out.
[16:20:18] <popl> andrewhood125: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ # use the examples here
[16:20:40] <popl> andrewhood125: now we get .done, .fail, and .always methods
[16:20:42] <popl> that's neat
[16:20:44] <Paradisee> is there a way to make decimal values into a jquery slider
[16:20:45] <Paradisee> ?
[16:20:51] <robertmaxrees> err, not necessarily deprecated ;)
[16:20:53] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: hmm no ajax
[16:20:59] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: how come?
[16:21:10] <popl> robertmaxrees: That's what it says on the site, so I'm taking it to the bank. :)
[16:21:12] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee you need to see if it works at all.
[16:21:16] <robertmaxrees> popl where does it say that?
[16:21:34] <popl> robertmaxrees: That URL I just linked.
[16:21:39] <robertmaxrees> I'm looking at it now.
[16:21:43] <popl> search for "Deprecation Notice"
[16:21:52] <robertmaxrees> jqXHR.success() is deprecated, yes.
[16:22:02] <robertmaxrees> but success: function() {} isn't iirc.
[16:22:07] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: hmm i kind of confuse
[16:22:10] <popl> I didn't say it was!
[16:22:11] <popl> :P
[16:22:11] <robertmaxrees> gotta be careful how you phrase that ;)
[16:22:16] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee by what?
[16:22:25] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee hit the url directly without using ajax - does that work?
[16:22:33] <popl> "oh wow, .success was deprecated in 1.8" # notice '.' :P
[16:22:43] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: u mean hit the like button
[16:22:44] <ZionZee> ?
[16:22:53] <popl> maybe I should be more meticulous about using « and ».
[16:23:02] <robertmaxrees> that's actually kind of annoying hahahaha
[16:23:12] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee i mean load the URL you're requesting directly.
[16:23:34] <robertmaxrees> you're running a $.get() against a URL - try to load that URL using your browser directly instead of using ajax.  see if that works.
[16:26:17] <ZionZee> nope
[16:26:21] <ZionZee> it doesn't
[16:26:26] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee then your issue is somewhere else.
[16:30:52] <ZionZee> ok let say i want create a vote button press the button once will +1 vote in database and the button will show +1
[16:30:57] <ZionZee> how am i going to do it?
[16:31:23] <robertmaxrees> lots of different ways.
[16:31:36] <robertmaxrees> which part are you stuck on?
[16:31:57] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: the part where you give the entire code
[16:32:04] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[16:32:47] <ZionZee> this is a combination of django query and ajax
[16:32:54] <ZionZee> do u understand django
[16:32:56] <ZionZee> ?
[16:33:04] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee this isn't a django/python channel :)
[16:33:14] <robertmaxrees> you should go to a channel dedicated to those topics for help on those.
[16:33:19] <ZionZee> lol ok
[16:38:35] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/dunoqupoqe/1/edit?js,output
[16:38:45] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:38:49] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: for the data-qnsid
[16:38:57] <robertmaxrees> $(this).data("qnsid");
[16:38:59] <ZionZee> this variable is from a html button
[16:39:07] <robertmaxrees> also, $('likes') isn't valid.
[16:39:15] <robertmaxrees> you might mean $('.likes')
[16:40:55] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: ok I'm followinging this tutorial http://jsbin.com/juwokupomu/1/edit
[16:41:35] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: i have strictly follow the tutorial why is it still unable to update the vote after clicking button
[16:42:54] <robertmaxrees> then it'd be $('#likes')
[16:44:28] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty weird tutorial if it's suggesting that you use .attr() for data attributes.
[16:46:07] <snover> not weird
[16:46:17] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i think it is
[16:46:19] <snover> jQuery.prototype.data does stupid things
[16:46:38] <robertmaxrees> maybe unexpected, sure.
[16:47:06] <ZionZee> hmm so what should i do?
[16:47:28] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee start with the django/python side of things.
[16:47:52] <robertmaxrees> once that part is working fully, sprinkly in the JS
[16:48:15] <ZionZee> oh i can increase my vote by this
[16:48:17] <BillCriswell> snover: The auto converting to certain data types?
[16:48:25] <snover> BillCriswell: yes
[16:48:40] <snover> i mean, generally, taking the data attributes from the dom
[16:48:53] <ZionZee> funenglish/like_question/?question_id=1
[16:48:59] <BillCriswell> snover: That bothers a lot of people. It never really bit me.
[16:49:00] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee so that part works?
[16:49:03] <snover> jQuery#data isn’t a dataset equivalent
[16:49:06] <ZionZee> yup!
[16:49:16] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell same here.  it always seems to work fine for me.
[16:49:17] <snover> it’s a way to store JS data associated with a DOM node without leaking in old browsers that nobody uses any more
[16:49:18] <ZionZee> this can increase my vote funenglish/like_question/?question_id=1
[16:49:34] <BillCriswell> snover: Understood.
[16:49:36] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee then try to use the javascript the tutorial gave you.
[16:49:38] <snover> yeah
[16:49:38] <robertmaxrees> what happens?
[16:49:38] <snover> so
[16:49:39] <snover> :)
[16:49:55] <robertmaxrees> snover it also caches things iirc.
[16:50:33] <snover> if you have some crap in a data attribute it will pull that data into the backing JS object, it’s not really caching per se
[16:50:46] <robertmaxrees> it's close enough for me.
[16:51:04] <robertmaxrees> i rarely use data attributes any more anyway so it's kind of a moot point.
[16:51:42] <BillCriswell> moot is a funny word.
[16:52:05] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking time to play some xbox.
[16:52:08] <snover> pianist is a funny word.
[16:52:12] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[16:52:16] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: i have tried using this http://jsbin.com/juwokupomu/1/edit?js,output but unable to work
[16:52:23] <BillCriswell> Later!
[16:52:26] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee go back to what you had originally.
[16:52:55] <robertmaxrees> you're not using .data() correctly there, but I'd rather go back to whatever the tutorial had.
[16:53:08] <snover> robertmaxrees: did b-ot ever send you my message?
[16:53:16] <robertmaxrees> not that i saw.
[16:53:27] <snover> b-ot: don’t be a crap and give robertmaxrees my message from a week ago
[16:53:38] <robertmaxrees> it may have and i just didn't see it.
[16:53:58] <snover> robertmaxrees: say “b-ot: read”
[16:54:04] <robertmaxrees> b-ot: read
[16:54:04] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: From snover, 5d 19h ago: i’m consistently disappointed with the way everything i have ever seen tries to explain object creation, `this`, and constructors, so i wrote something else. maybe you can look into using it the next time it comes up, with improvements. https://gist.github.com/csnover/eb8ef0bbfac0329bbca5
[16:54:14] <snover> booooom.
[16:56:25] <robertmaxrees> Interesting take.
[16:57:07] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/juwokupomu/1/edit?js
[16:57:21] <ZionZee> robertmaxrees: this is the original want
[16:57:32] <ZionZee> unable to work
[16:57:35] <robertmaxrees> what happens when you use it?
[16:57:59] <rmill> snover: remember when the bot in here was reliable ;)
[16:58:10] <snover> rmill: that was a thing ever?!
[16:58:19] <rmill> no, never
[16:58:21] <snover> rmill: also: no?!?!
[16:58:22] <snover> :)
[16:59:06] <ZionZee> nth happen
[16:59:19] <ZionZee> unable to increase the vote
[16:59:20] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee open your console - do you see anything in there?
[17:00:28] <ZionZee> http://jsbin.com/dunoqupoqe/1/edit?html,output
[17:00:33] <snover> robertmaxrees: having Object.create is lucky, it is harder to deconstruct prototype creation if you have to start with constructors :)
[17:00:36] <rmill> b-ot: wuz u ever reliable?
[17:00:36] <b-ot> rmill: yes.
[17:00:45] <snover> hmm.
[17:00:47] <rmill> lies
[17:00:51] <snover> i agree with lies.
[17:01:17] <robertmaxrees> ZionZee dunno then.
[17:01:43] <ZionZee> lol
[17:01:52] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it it's hard to help.
[17:02:01] <robertmaxrees> but soemthing tells me it's a caching issue.
[17:04:24] <novice> hi everyone
[17:04:53] <novice> can i get om help with a few issues i am having?
[17:04:58] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ novice
[17:04:58] <b-ot> novice: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:05:33] <novice> ok nice one sorry first time on an irc started coding about 2 months ago finished the javascript module on codecademy done some jquery
[17:05:49] <novice> i am curious as to i really enjoy pure javascript but i understand it is very tricky to manipulate elements in the dom with raw javascript
[17:05:57] <novice> would you suggest just using query
[17:06:06] <novice> or is it possible to build full apps with raw JS
[17:06:15] <robertmaxrees> it's possible.
[17:06:23] <robertmaxrees> it depends on your needs.
[17:06:45] <novice> right
[17:07:14] <Robdgreat> let's weigh the reasons for and against using jquery
[17:07:14] <novice> i am building a web page with a linked web app that helps students get into a certain university based on some software i am developing which incorporates a database of data and spews out info based on certain her input
[17:07:24] <novice> certain user input*
[17:07:29] <novice> ok great
[17:08:27] <robertmaxrees> do you think you'd find value in using it?
[17:08:50] <novice> ijust enjoy it thats all
[17:08:53] <robertmaxrees> it'll abstract out some of the painful parts of DOM manipulation, though more modern browsers render that less and less prudent.
[17:09:04] <novice> right
[17:09:08] <robertmaxrees> it helps to fill in some gaps and takes care of some things for you.
[17:09:25] <Robdgreat> and there's still plenty of non-drudgery left to write yourself
[17:09:37] <robertmaxrees> sure.  it entirely depends on what exactly you need.
[17:10:08] <novice> i just want to learn to code with no limitations in html css js php and some database language like sql
[17:10:16] <novice> i believe those langs will help me to fulfil all the projects i need to
[17:10:25] <robertmaxrees> you can use jquery while learning JS.
[17:10:34] <robertmaxrees> hell, can't use jquery with using JS ;)
[17:10:49] <robertmaxrees> err, *without using JS i mean
[17:11:10] <novice> what do you code in which langs do you know
[17:11:55] <robertmaxrees> javascript, html, css primarily.  i know some asp, C#, java, scala, and a few others.
[17:12:04] <novice> nice
[17:12:07] <robertmaxrees> also use coldfusion at the current gig (terrible terrible language)
[17:12:11] <robertmaxrees> python, little ruby, etc.
[17:12:12] <novice> lol
[17:12:16] <novice> thats pretty awesome
[17:12:30] <novice> i want to build a backend for my website
[17:12:35] <novice> i am also confused with ordering this
[17:12:39] <novice> should i write out all my html and css first
[17:12:40] <novice> for the website
[17:12:43] <novice> and then apply js?
[17:12:46] <novice> and then code a backend?
[17:12:50] <novice> is that the order i should follow?
[17:12:53] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: I'm using PHP... it's only slightly better.
[17:12:58] <systemfault> (at work)
[17:13:06] <robertmaxrees> systemfault we tried to use magento for a while and abandoned it.
[17:13:13] <robertmaxrees> we have kind of a special use case.
[17:13:23] <systemfault> Ahh ok
[17:13:45] <robertmaxrees> novice the enter key isn't punctuation btw ;) and it depends.
[17:13:53] <systemfault> novice: backend/frontend can often be done in parallel.
[17:13:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd build out your backend with minimal markup.
[17:14:20] <robertmaxrees> you'll flesh it out as time goes along.  then add in your js.  go for an MVP style first pass.
[17:14:23] <systemfault> novice: Unless you're writing a web application, you can do most of the JS at the end
[17:14:40] <novice_> sorry dc
[17:15:23] <robertmaxrees> we were saying there's no real order.
[17:15:26] <novice_> i wnant to work on a project which will use a raspberry pi initially and will attempt to calculate the speed a ball is travelling using some type if IR or laser
[17:15:28] <novice_> is it possible?
[17:15:28] <systemfault> novice_: Frontend and backend can often be done in parallel (order doesn't matter that much as long as you have a vision)
[17:15:29] <robertmaxrees> you'll build it out all kind of in parralel.
[17:15:32] <novice_> with python
[17:15:35] <robertmaxrees> novice wat
[17:15:59] <robertmaxrees> uh, maybe?  the PI might support python.
[17:16:01] <robertmaxrees> no clue thoguh
[17:16:23] <systemfault> So... we went from a website with a bit of JS to a raspberry pie calculating the speed of a ball...
[17:16:28] <systemfault> Makes TOTAL sense.
[17:17:04] <novice_> i am a med student and i have many ideas and i a just starting to learn to code to fulfil all these ideas
[17:17:10] <robertmaxrees> start slow.
[17:17:12] <novice_> one is a website with html css javascript and a backend helping students get into med school
[17:17:14] <robertmaxrees> one project at a time.
[17:17:28] <novice_> this will have a database which gives information based on user input
[17:17:32] <novice_> if that makes sense
[17:17:38] <robertmaxrees> that's every webapp ever
[17:17:55] <novice_> right so to be more specific
[17:17:56] <robertmaxrees> saying "a website with html css javascript and a backend" is like saying "normal air with nitrogen and oxygen"
[17:18:06] <robertmaxrees> i know what you want to build.  you wnat to make a college recs service
[17:18:19] <novice_> idk what that is but it s a service with an app which allows user input
[17:18:21] <novice_> and based on that input
[17:18:30] <novice_> it produces a different output (information)\
[17:18:35] <novice_> which the user can print off or download and use
[17:18:46] <robertmaxrees> that's basically every webapp known to man.
[17:18:55] <novice_> lol
[17:19:03] <robertmaxrees> seriously.
[17:19:30] <novice_> ok lets move to the next prokject
[17:19:59] <novice_> the next project is i want to use some piece of hardware that uses a infrared beam or laser to be able to calculate the speed something is travelling to the beam would take an input based on an algorithm
[17:20:02] <novice_> and produce an output
[17:20:03] <novice_> which can be used
[17:20:06] <novice_> all in real time
[17:20:23] <novice_> so the beam*
[17:20:23] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[17:21:10] <novice_> any ideas?
[17:21:15] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[17:21:27] * Robdgreat makes popcorn
[17:21:48] <novice_> the project i just mentioned
[17:21:54] <robertmaxrees> you want to build a chronograph
[17:22:07] <robertmaxrees> err wait.
[17:22:18] <robertmaxrees> that's what we always called them in paintpall
[17:22:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, a gun chronograph.
[17:22:37] <novice_> the end vision
[17:22:43] <novice_> is to use this in a casino on the game of roulette in real time
[17:22:50] <robertmaxrees> though this is terribly offtopic for the channel.
[17:22:59] <novice_> to code a device that will predict where a ball will land in roulette
[17:23:03] <Robdgreat> maybe novice_ wants to make this in jquery
[17:23:09] <novice_> lol
[17:23:12] <Robdgreat> *with jquery
[17:23:14] <novice_> i don't think its possible in jquery
[17:23:22] <Robdgreat> then why are you asking here? :P
[17:23:25] <novice_> as i thought thats just used to produce effects for the user
[17:23:38] <novice_> this is the first irc i got to by chance and i am learning js and query on codecademy
[17:23:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah that really don't have anything to do with the channel topic.
[17:23:48] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't
[17:23:53] <novice_> but its still an interesting projec
[17:23:54] <novice_> project
[17:24:06] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change the channel topic ;)
[17:25:06] <novice_> nobody wants to share any ideas just because its off topic?
[17:25:16] <robertmaxrees> i just did - you want to build a chronograph.
[17:25:22] <novice_> its not a chronograph
[17:25:43] <robertmaxrees> or a radar gun.
[17:25:49] <novice_> yes some type of gun
[17:25:50] <novice_> that will measure
[17:25:53] <novice_> what i tell it to
[17:25:56] <novice_> and calculate and produce an output
[17:25:59] <novice_> in real time
[17:26:06] <novice_> but i need to produce the whole thing myself
[17:26:10] <robertmaxrees> enter key isn't puncuation btw ;)
[17:26:10] <novice_> hence why i have started on codecademy
[17:26:20] <robertmaxrees> and go google around for how to build that.
[17:26:51] <novice_> ok lets talk about query then
[17:26:52] <novice_> jquery
[17:27:24] <novice_> why do people use jq and not hand code everything in JS just because all the tools are given in jquery
[17:27:31] <novice_> isn't it more interesting to be able to code it urself using raw JS
[17:27:42] <robertmaxrees> it gets pretty repetitive.
[17:27:46] <SirLagz> novice_: save lots of time using jquery
[17:27:50] <robertmaxrees> having to fix the same problems over and over and over.
[17:27:51] <SirLagz> novice_: and time is money
[17:28:02] <tw2113> jQuery does solve a lot of browser inconsistencies
[17:28:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery handles a lot of that for me and lets me solve bigger problems.
[17:28:12] <tw2113> but ultimately it's up to you to decide what to use
[17:28:12] <novice_> but isn't it slightly unintellectual to just write in .toggle or .fadeOut etc
[17:28:18] <novice_> for an effect
[17:28:21] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:28:25] <novice_> i would like to be able to code all of this in pure JS
[17:28:34] <tw2113> what's stopping you?
[17:28:44] <robertmaxrees> who cares about the intellectual exercize of wasting time by writing the same animation over and over and over?
[17:29:02] <novice_> there are very few resources teaching it and from my own understanding using JS on elements in the DOM is very very hard
[17:29:11] <robertmaxrees> it can be, yes.
[17:29:18] <tw2113> i think you just gave reasons why people use jQuery instead
[17:29:21] <novice_> so what is the point in knowing for loops while loops objects functions if else do statements in JS if I will never ever get to use it in jquery
[17:29:23] <novice_> i don't get it
[17:29:28] <robertmaxrees> you will use them.
[17:29:31] <robertmaxrees> jquery abstracts the DOM.
[17:29:33] <robertmaxrees> not the language.
[17:29:35] <tw2113> you won't get to use those with jQuery?
[17:29:36] <novice_> because i really enjoyed all of JS and when i got to query module its all just basic stuff
[17:29:49] <robertmaxrees> novice_ you still use those things when using jquery
[17:29:54] <novice_> right
[17:29:54] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting concepts.
[17:29:59] <novice_> where would i get to use those
[17:30:00] <tw2113> even with jQuery I use if else statements and loops
[17:30:19] <robertmaxrees> you can iterate/enumerate over things with loops.
[17:30:24] <novice_> i know that
[17:30:27] <novice_> thats defining a for loop
[17:30:30] <novice_> how can i use it in my code
[17:30:32] <robertmaxrees> conditionals are still a thing.
[17:30:35] <novice_> to actually do something functional
[17:30:53] <novice_> i can write a full html page style it with css
[17:30:55] <tw2113> $div = $('#main'); if ( $div.length > 0 ) { //do something }
[17:30:57] <novice_> but i want to be able to code it
[17:31:09] <novice_> yeah fair enough
[17:31:12] <novice_> good example
[17:31:16] <novice_> i didn't know i can use all of that
[17:31:21] <novice_> so i can use all of my JS in query code?
[17:31:21] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:31:26] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript.
[17:31:30] <tw2113> jQuery is javascript, javascript is not jQuery
[17:31:31] <novice_> i know that
[17:31:31] <robertmaxrees> it's not a different language.
[17:31:40] <novice_> but it seems very abstracted
[17:31:42] <novice_> and different
[17:31:42] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:31:50] <novice_> i guess codecademy do a very bad job of linking JS to real life stuff
[17:31:54] <robertmaxrees> just an object with some special methods and properties.
[17:31:56] <Robdgreat> apparently
[17:32:13] <novice_> how long will it take me to be realistically proficient at html css and JS/jq uery
[17:32:16] <novice_> remember i am a med student
[17:32:19] <novice_> studying at uni also
[17:32:38] <robertmaxrees> define "proficient"
[17:32:53] <systemfault> A few months.
[17:32:54] <novice_> comfortable to produce decent front end sites
[17:32:57] <andrewhood125> Hey all, I'm getting a "TypeError: this.events is undefined" http://jsfiddle.net/3L0mx7zw/
[17:32:58] <novice_> nothing too complex
[17:33:17] <andrewhood125> Should I be referencing this.events in a different way?
[17:33:29] <robertmaxrees> andrewhood125 the 'this' object in the .done callback is different than the this in the parent function
[17:33:51] <andrewhood125> robertmaxrees: How can I access the parents events property?
[17:34:05] <robertmaxrees> something like http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3L0mx7zw/1/
[17:34:30] <novice_> so within 6 months i could be proficient in html css js and j qu e ry easily? i don't mean i know everything by then but know enough to code nice looking front end sites with full comfort?
[17:34:33] <andrewhood125> robertmaxrees: Aha. Thanks
[17:34:43] <robertmaxrees> novice_ that also requires knowing design.
[17:34:49] <robertmaxrees> you're changing your goal.
[17:35:13] <novice_> ellaborate please
[17:35:16] <robertmaxrees> in your case, a year or so?  depending.
[17:35:20] <tw2113> js/jquery don't necessarily need to even be present to get a "nice looking frontend"
[17:35:42] <novice_> to use passwords and log ins and all that stuff
[17:35:51] <robertmaxrees> that involves knowing a backend as well.
[17:35:52] <novice_> do i just design them with <button> and /,input> tags for example
[17:35:53] <tw2113> you're getting into server-side there
[17:35:57] <novice_> and then can use php to do all the rest?
[17:36:01] <novice_> is that correct understanding?
[17:36:14] <robertmaxrees> enter key isn't puncuation duder.
[17:36:19] <robertmaxrees> and sort of, yeah.
[17:36:26] <novice_> can 1 person do all of this?
[17:36:29] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:36:32] <novice_> and learn it all?
[17:36:34] <tw2113> with enough time and experience
[17:36:44] <novice_> right well that is my goal
[17:37:34] <novice_> where do you suggest me to learn as you guys don't seem to have used code academy lol
[17:37:56] <robertmaxrees> i know a few people who used code academy successfully, but it's not going to teach you everything.
[17:38:01] <tw2113> i wager most of us just started coding things and googled when necessary
[17:38:12] <andrewhood125> ^^ that
[17:38:15] <robertmaxrees> it's a starting point - you use that knowledge and take it further on your own to build something.
[17:38:34] <novice_> i dont understand the javasceipr i see on youtube for example and other sites tbh but i feel confident with if else do while objects arrays data types string manipulation making basic games etc
[17:38:40] <tw2113> learning the how and why and when to use what will get you farther than specific tutorials
[17:38:41] <novice_> but when i look at other sites scripts to learn
[17:38:42] <novice_> i get nothing
[17:38:59] <tw2113> be aware of what's minimized javascript
[17:39:02] <novice_> but where exactly did you guys learn from what resources
[17:39:05] <novice_> minimsed JS?
[17:39:11] <robertmaxrees> novice_ MDN is a good resource.
[17:39:20] <robertmaxrees> javascript: the definitive guide and javascript: the good parts are good imo.
[17:39:21] <novice_> theres still basic things i see int heir code like functions and the rest but i don't understand what they're actually doing
[17:39:30] <novice_> i have the definitive guide i have just started working through it
[17:39:33] <robertmaxrees> though the latter has a lot of opinions presented as facts, still a good read.
[17:39:35] <novice_> do you think that will make me proficient in JS?
[17:39:44] <tw2113> then that's the first step...reading how you create functions in js
[17:39:45] <robertmaxrees> reading books only gets you so far.
[17:39:56] <robertmaxrees> actually writing code is how you learn.
[17:40:15] <novice_> ok and i want to host all of this on my own server
[17:40:20] <novice_> can you guys offer any thoughts on that?
[17:40:25] <robertmaxrees> don't
[17:40:36] <robertmaxrees> get a host elsewhere.
[17:40:40] <novice_> why
[17:40:52] <tw2113> own server meaning one you set up yourself?
[17:41:04] <tw2113> or own server where you purchased some hosting from say DreamHost or somewhere else
[17:41:05] <robertmaxrees> your ISP likely won't appreciate you using your home connection for hosting.
[17:41:09] <novice_> yes i will buy the box stack it up install apache mysql php and the rest and then just buy the domain and host
[17:41:16] <novice_> i rang my lisp they are fine with it
[17:41:17] <novice_> isp
[17:41:23] <robertmaxrees> and you have a static IP?>
[17:41:25] <novice_> just they won't help me if the server goes down because it won't be down to them
[17:41:29] <novice_> yes i can set it in my network settings
[17:41:34] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:41:39] <robertmaxrees> your ISP has to give you a static IP.
[17:41:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not something you do on your end.
[17:41:51] <novice_> i can assign static and dynamic ips
[17:41:59] <robertmaxrees> where?
[17:42:02] <novice_> i assigned my printer a static earlier today
[17:42:05] <novice_> virgin superhub
[17:42:07] <robertmaxrees> that's different.
[17:42:08] <novice_> im in the uk
[17:42:12] <robertmaxrees> that's inside your network.
[17:42:17] <robertmaxrees> not to the internet at large.
[17:42:20] <novice_> so my server will be inside my network aswell
[17:42:33] <robertmaxrees> right - you can give it a static ip inside your network.
[17:42:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not the IP your isp leases to you.
[17:42:44] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:42:46] <novice_> true
[17:42:46] <novice_> ok
[17:42:59] <novice_> please elaborate though why i shouldn't host the site myself
[17:43:03] <novice_> other than ip issues
[17:43:05] <novice_> and cost issues
[17:43:26] <tw2113> do you know a lot about system administration and maintenance?
[17:43:40] <tw2113> or is that another for your list of things you'd like to learn?
[17:43:41] <novice_> i don't know a lot about anything but i read heavily and i am not too bad
[17:43:51] <novice_> i can configure networks
[17:43:56] <novice_> have done a few basic penetration testing courses
[17:44:02] <novice_> which went through network principles in decent detail
[17:44:13] <novice_> so i have an understanding of what i need to with setting up my own server
[17:44:13] <andrewhood125> Could someone point me to a resource for calling a function by a string? If I have a string: var method = "truncate"; how would I got about.. callMethod(method);
[17:44:17] <novice_> but as i said i have never done it before
[17:44:37] <novice_> functionname("string")
[17:45:02] <novice_> ;
[17:45:53] <systemfault> andrewhood125: is the function on an object?
[17:46:23] <andrewhood125> systemfault: Yes, I'd need to pass the function an object
[17:46:27] <novice_> an object can contain a function (aka method)
[17:46:41] <novice_> when calling an object you should just type the object name or whatever you want to target directly
[17:46:50] <novice_> object.name for example
[17:46:53] <systemfault> andrewhood125: theObject["string']() ?
[17:46:59] <systemfault> * theObject["string"]();  //sorry
[17:47:41] <novice_> guys where would i use objects in real life on my website
[17:47:45] <novice_> when using JS of cours
[17:47:48] <novice_> give me an exmple
[17:48:12] <andrewhood125> systemfault: Ah very cool thanks.
[17:48:34] <andrewhood125> If the function lives outside of theObject can I use.. window? I saw that online.
[17:48:52] <andrewhood125> window["string"](payload) ?
[17:49:23] <systemfault> andrewhood125: You use the object the function is attached to... if it's not attached, you can't do it without crap like eval()
[17:53:38] <reynierpm> hi there, how do I remove the last td (<td>FFF</td>) element on the html var before append it to #selFabricanteBody? Here is the example http://jsbin.com/lojunohice/1/edit?js,output
[17:59:07] <wa5ted> reynierpm: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16049349/jquery-remove-last-li-from-ul
[17:59:09] <wa5ted> similar idea
[18:00:51] <reynierpm> thanks wa5ted I will take a look
[18:06:43] <robertmaxrees> back
[19:46:32] <Rukouen> hi, I'm using a $('a + b') selector and want to select both elements together, not just b, any ideas?
[20:46:19] <slavka`> hey guys, i know this more of a bootstrap question but that channel seems a bit dead... hey guys, i installed bootstrap using bower... but noticed that it doesnt actualy have the assets directory... (or the docs in that manner).. so just wondering whats the best way to encorporate the those folders into my bootstrap based site?
[21:00:43] <Mark_2> does anybody know how i can implement that bar on the top that disappears when i click on the x? http://www.abercrombie.com/shop/wd
[21:41:47] <CssNoob> I hate jquery, any good video tutorials?
[21:41:57] <CssNoob> offset?
[22:10:41] <Sagar> Hello, i want to know how can i delay a jquery ajax post, let us say, when we click button x, it takes the arrays from the field (let assume 10 arrays) i want that it should post each array after 1 or 2 second delay instead of all at once, how can i do that, any help?
[23:12:31] <sabesto> Having a go at jqwidgets datagrid with json/php and server side paging, replicated this: http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-documentation/documentation/phpintegration/php-server-side-grid-paging-and-sorting.htm , but data[0].TotalRows seems to be undefined, if i set it to 10 it works
[23:13:29] <sabesto> any pointers on this?
[23:39:01] <sabesto> heh, it should be data.TotalRows, all their examples are wrong
[23:42:17] <slavka`> this may be more related to bootstrap or bower but maybe someone would be kind enaff to help me anyway... hey guys, i noticed that bower installation of bootstrap is not the same as the download from source available on the website... anyone can explain why the bower install doesnt have docs directory?
[23:49:20] <SirLagz> slavka`: pssht who needs docs anyway :P
[23:51:04] <slavka`> i do when those docs have assets directory that reference .js scripts referenced in examples...
