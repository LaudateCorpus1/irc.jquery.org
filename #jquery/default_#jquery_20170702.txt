[09:44:05] <Fredi> Hi, can people help with jquery mobile here also? :)
[13:24:10] <Nemesis19> Hello
[13:24:50] <Nemesis19> I need to add a class to the image child element of a div with a class
[13:25:04] <Nemesis19> inside a page with a body.home
[13:25:55] <Nemesis19> so let’s say I have this body.home then many divs and after a while a div.header-content, this last div is nested is not a direct child of body.home
[13:26:04] <Nemesis19> so I wrote jQuery('.home .header-content > img').addClass('no-lazy');
[13:26:30] <Nemesis19> img is a direct child, but between .home and .header-content do I need to put something?
[13:26:48] <Nemesis19> because this code doesn’t add the class
[15:15:00] <S1GM4> Hallo, I am the n00b
[15:15:14] <S1GM4> I want to do this: $("." + ids).on("click",function(e)   <--- but ids is an array and it is popularated.
[15:15:36] <S1GM4> How can I make it to make the click function for all of those class that are in such an array as called ids ?
