[00:00:09] <pif> mehrdad: install ubuntu then
[00:00:14] <Cork> but ya xserver has some really buggy behaviors
[00:00:19] <mehrdad> on ubuntu right now
[00:00:25] * prometh has a quick question above
[00:00:32] <mehrdad> u male it as if ubuntu is not fucking using xserver and all other bullshit
[00:00:39] <mindis|wurk> windows is okay-ish for me (i don't even really use anything else) but i have some problems with the way it uses resources and the file explorers and dialogs have been unusably atrocious since vista
[00:00:43] <mehrdad> they are all just different in their names basically
[00:00:50] <Cork> ?.filter @ prometh
[00:00:51] <bot-t> prometh, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[00:00:57] <prometh> thank you
[00:01:48] <mindis|wurk> thankfully there's directory opus which makes file exploring the way it should be so i don't have to touch the ms abominations :/
[00:01:58] <mindis|wurk> except when some dialog appears. ugh
[00:02:15] <mehrdad> mindis|wurk, i dont quite get the resource s part, but i am not sure if u can expect any better from an os that has to support so much crap
[00:02:28] <mehrdad> that is not to defend it tho
[00:02:34] <mehrdad> not an apology exactly
[00:02:39] <mehrdad> just a little credit maybe
[00:03:06] <mindis|wurk> well it's essentially a bloated system where you can't even prevent it from needlessly accessing the hard drive all the time
[00:03:48] <mehrdad> assuming it does, does it pose any problems?
[00:04:13] <mehrdad> i pick on Windows where its due
[00:04:30] <mehrdad> like when...
[00:04:33] <mehrdad> when....
[00:04:36] * mehrdad thinks
[00:05:17] <mindis|wurk> of course it does. it reduces the lifetime of the hardware. take SSDs for example, they only have a limited amount of writes so writing even itty bitty stuff all the time when the user doesn't have a need for it is very bad
[00:05:19] <mehrdad> sorry can't remember right now
[00:05:45] <mehrdad> i am not sure if it happens to me too
[00:05:52] <mehrdad> maybe haven't paid attention
[00:06:10] <mehrdad> or maybe because i have no crapware running in the background
[00:06:13] <mehrdad> no AV
[00:06:46] <pif> granted, win7 is starting to look polished, but I'd never use it as a dev env; I need a proper shell, command-line, database, perl and whatnot
[00:07:08] <mehrdad> i know , a terminal junkie
[00:07:14] <pif> and not the special 'ported' versions of these tools
[00:07:15] <mehrdad> seen them, met them, work with them
[00:07:31] <pif> mehrdad: well I need to get work done you know ;)
[00:08:07] <mehrdad> ur tools are not native to windows and are linux-first , so no disagreement there
[00:08:14] <mindis|wurk> another thing that i don't like about modern windows and windows software design that it has inherited from unix and other systems is the habit of shoving stuff in the users folder
[00:08:46] <mindis|wurk> or on c: in general
[00:08:59] <mehrdad> shove what?! :-/
[00:10:00] <mindis|wurk> everything unless the user intervenes (if he's allowed that is)
[00:10:53] <mehrdad> well c: is Windows itself basically
[00:11:20] <Zogot> Morgen!
[00:11:36] <mehrdad> if you mean the personal folders being on CL by default, i do agree
[00:12:07] <mehrdad> but you can change it, and that u mentionede
[00:12:07] <mehrdad> mentioned*
[00:12:32] <mindis|wurk> if i were in a position of power on microsoft, i'd put a new doctrine in place that says no software writes beyond its own folder unless the user says so
[00:13:16] <mehrdad> for its core stuff, a program /can/ right now do what u said
[00:13:29] <mehrdad> think google chrome
[00:13:40] <mindis|wurk> can, but won't because herp derp lets write crap on c:
[00:14:03] <mindis|wurk> ideally they shouldn't write much if at all in registry either
[00:14:42] <mehrdad> so u approve writing to registry and not files?
[00:15:06] <mindis|wurk> read what i said. i imply it's sometimes acceptable
[00:15:24] <mindis|wurk> mainly for registering filetypes and such
[00:16:11] <mehrdad> dunno, maybe send a suggestion to MS or ask them why don't they do that
[00:16:34] <mindis|wurk> it's just a difference in design philosophy
[00:17:07] <mehrdad> surely they have their own basis for the design?!
[00:17:07] <mindis|wurk> i know why the whole my documents thing is there, i just don't approve of it
[00:22:42] <mehrdad> mindis|wurk, the windows 8 on arm is an opportunity for MS to start afresh and do away with some legacy stuff
[00:23:12] <mindis|wurk> yeah. and then they went and invented metro ;)
[00:23:59] <mehrdad> was meant to ridicule it?
[00:24:17] <mindis|wurk> yep
[00:24:23] <mehrdad> metro has nothing to do with ARM tho
[00:24:33] <mehrdad> it's there on x86 as well
[00:24:38] <mindis|wurk> i know
[00:24:45] <mehrdad> and u can't satisfy all , like they say right?
[00:25:19] <mehrdad> u dont like it on a regular non-touch pc, right?
[00:25:53] <mindis|wurk> correct, but to me it seems more like just another attempt to change things just for the sake of changing them
[00:26:31] <mehrdad> i understand what u mean
[00:27:01] <mehrdad> but on the other hand, ppl have been mocking and bashing ms for not coming up with a touch friendly ui
[00:27:50] <mehrdad> and lets be honest , the average joe has his brain in his eyes
[00:28:50] <mehrdad> he looks at the screen: it looks the same as windows 7, why the hell should i upgrade?!
[00:30:55] <mehrdad> but metro is more than visual change
[00:31:07] <mehrdad> we'll see in coming years
[00:31:14] <mindis|wurk> yes, i understand the business reasoning. doesn't make it any more acceptable from a user pov :)
[00:33:02] <mehrdad> the first iteration might not be the bomb tho
[00:33:10] <Whirl3d> mehrdad, I'm really sick of you spamming this channel with ms bullshit. If you want to discuss the relative merits of ms, try #ms, not #jquery. If it's not on topic, stfu
[00:33:32] <mehrdad> well uh, knew it would come
[00:33:37] <mehrdad> ok
[00:33:53] <Hooloovoork> Whirl3d: thank you
[00:37:47] <Whirl3d> ;) It's easy to get carried away, we all do it from time to time.
[00:40:41] <whomp> i need all 3 of buttons to open a dialog upon being clicked, but currently only one of them does this. why is that?
[00:40:45] <whomp> link: http://thesparkcollective.com/members/misc.html#
[00:44:35] <Whirl3d> whomp you can only have 1 id per element.
[00:44:45] <Whirl3d> $("#opener") can only ever refer to a single element.
[00:44:58] <Whirl3d> if you have multiple elements with id='opener', you fail
[00:45:08] <Whirl3d> use a class instead
[00:45:12] <whomp> how do i get all of them to do the same thing then?
[00:45:13] <whomp> ok
[00:45:24] <Whirl3d> then select all elements of the ".opener" class
[00:45:30] <Whirl3d> then bind your events.
[00:45:40] <whomp> ahh i see
[00:45:47] <Whirl3d> Or, even better yet, if you are using jquery 1.7, use the .on handler
[00:46:12] <whomp> i am using jquery 1.9
[00:46:20] <whomp> i rebuilt everything from scratch
[00:46:37] <Whirl3d> attach it to the wrapper element like $("#wrapper").on("click","a",function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); do whatever});
[00:46:47] <Whirl3d> there is no jquery 1.9
[00:47:01] <whomp> i had to make it myself
[00:47:11] <Whirl3d> then it's wquery, not jquery
[00:47:38] <whomp> jquery would be honored to have it in their repository
[00:47:53] <Whirl3d> and listen. If you don't know that elements have to have unique ID's, I doubt it
[00:48:02] <whomp> i was testing you
[00:48:07] <Whirl3d> nicer try
[00:48:19] <whomp> you failed
[00:49:11] <Whirl3d> and besides, you are using google's cdn.
[00:49:37] <whomp> yeah, i uploaded mine to google
[00:50:33] <Whirl3d> The folks on your "directors" page must have hired you because you certainly don't act/sound like someone with thier focus in mind.
[00:51:00] <whomp> yes that is why they hired me
[00:51:02] <whomp> makes sense now
[00:51:49] <Whirl3d> Gotta luv the ignore list...
[00:52:05] <coldhead> ignoring is sinful
[00:52:18] <Whirl3d> lying is sinful
[00:52:21] <whomp> sounds like someone's not going to hear about the release of 1.9
[00:52:25] <coldhead> you can't just go around ignoring people
[00:52:34] <Whirl3d> cheating is sinful
[00:52:40] <coldhead> you'll hurt their poor stupid feelings
[00:53:08] <Whirl3d> I release the need to take care of anyone else's feelings...
[00:53:22] <coldhead> aw that's very sad
[00:53:53] <coldhead> tell me who else you have ignored, Whirl3d, and i will bump up their font size to make up for it
[00:55:52] <blackspotwiggins> :D
[00:55:59] <blackspotwiggins> coldhead <3
[00:57:46] <Whirl3d> I know this is off-topic, but does anyone remember how to split a string into parts based on a regex object with capture groups?
[00:58:06] <Whirl3d> I have asked in #regex to no response...
[00:59:43] <oscardelben> Hi, I'm in this bizarre situation where I want to stop a parent event from being triggered. Is this possible by using selectors? https://gist.github.com/1843471
[00:59:44] <coldhead> ?eval â€‹'foo321bar123baz231aids'.match(/(\d+)/g)
[00:59:48] <bot-t> coldhead: ["321", "123", "231"]
[01:04:55] <Whirl3d> I was hoping for someting like "Mr. John Dough, Sr.".match(/^(Mr\.|Mrs\.|Ms\.|Miss)?(?: )([a-zA-z]*)(?: )([a-zA-Z]*)(?:[, ]{0,2})([a-zA-z]{2,5}\.)?/) would become [Mr., john, dough, sr]
[01:05:48] <Whirl3d> \me is trying String.match with multiple caputre groups.
[01:06:15] <Cork> well it should be somewhat
[01:06:34] <Cork> you would get the complete string as the first array value
[01:07:54] <coldhead> ?eval 'foo321bar123baz231aids'.match(/(\d+|a...)/g)
[01:07:55] <bot-t> coldhead: ["321", "ar12", "3", "az23", "1", "aids"]
[01:07:58] <Whirl3d> perfect. thanks.
[01:09:14] <Whirl3d> ?eval '(303) 867-5309'.match(/^(?:\(?(\d{3})\)?[^\d]{0,3})?(\d{3})(?:[^\d]{0,3})(\d{4})(?:[^\d]{0,10})(\d{0,5})?$/m)
[01:09:15] <bot-t> Whirl3d: ["(303) 867-5309", "303", "867", "5309", undefined]
[01:09:58] <coldhead> don't you dare use that regex in code
[01:10:14] <coldhead> the next person to maintain it will have a massive heart attack
[01:10:38] <Whirl3d> really? You should see the regex I cooked up for parsing names...lol
[01:11:19] <Whirl3d> it gets nearly every pssible combination of prefix, first name, last name, middle name, middle initial, suffix, and pedigree...
[01:11:28] <Whirl3d> it's hella-ugly, but it works.
[01:11:40] <coldhead> Whirl3d: http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/chapters/regular_expressions/heregexes
[01:11:59] <coldhead> it would be worth you writing those regexs in coffeescript and compile them to js
[01:12:19] <coldhead> so you don't throw up every time you read it
[01:12:50] <chee> perl's regex ignores whitespace like that
[01:13:03] <chee> it's certainly the right thing to do
[01:13:05] <coldhead> do you have a perl2js converter?
[01:13:18] <chee> yes
[01:13:44] <coldhead> those style regexs are coming to es.distant_future
[01:13:48] <coldhead> can't wait
[01:13:50] <coldhead> but must wait
[01:15:31] <chee> https://github.com/urandom/p2js
[01:16:28] <Whirl3d> I tried to implement XRegExp, but couldn't get it to work.
[01:17:26] <Whirl3d> ^(?:([a-zA-Z]{2,4}\.){0,1} ?([a-zA-Z]{2,24})) ([a-zA-Z]{1,1}\. ){0,1}([a-zA-Z]{2,24} ){0,2}([A-Za-z']{2,24})((?:, ([a-zA-Z]{2,5}\.?)){0,4}?)$/im/g
[01:17:36] <Whirl3d> ***joy***
[01:18:19] <coldhead> how do you sleep at night
[01:18:28] <Whirl3d> When do I sleep?
[01:18:41] <Whirl3d> Who told you I sleep? It's been at least 20 years...
[01:18:59] <coldhead> you have to stay awake all night working trying to understand your old regular expressions?
[01:21:17] <Whirl3d> Not only that, but I lost both hands in the war, so I type with my nose.
[01:23:38] <Whirl3d> If the truth be known, I use RegexBuddy to translate any/all regex. It's a great tool.
[01:25:13] <coldhead> the windows program?
[01:25:26] <Whirl3d> yeah.
[01:30:49] <chee> Whirl3d: about about Barons ?
[01:31:18] <chee> or knights !
[01:31:21] <Whirl3d> Barons?
[01:34:04] <chee> Whirl3d: yes
[01:35:07] <Whirl3d> what is Barons?
[01:35:39] <chee> ?eval 'Sir William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin'.match(/^(?:([a-zA-Z]{2,4}\.){0,1} ?([a-zA-Z]{2,24})) ([a-zA-Z]{1,1}\. ){0,1}([a-zA-Z]{2,24} ){0,2}([A-Za-z']{2,24})((?:, ([a-zA-Z]{2,5}\.?)){0,4}?)$/im/g)

[01:36:39] <chee> Lord George Gordon Byron
[01:36:40] <Whirl3d> There are bound to be some combinations that it doesn't work on. Things like military abbreviations, for example, often fail
[01:36:41] <chee> hmmm?
[01:36:55] <chee> General Fitzwallace
[01:37:04] <chee> I am very disappointed in your refex, Whirl3d
[01:37:12] <Whirl3d> don't use it then
[01:37:14] <Whirl3d> lol
[01:37:34] <chee> i will, but i won't enjoy it
[01:38:16] <coldhead> you just better hope he doesn't become a lord soon, Whirl3d
[01:38:24] <coldhead> or he'll set his hounds on you
[01:38:26] <Whirl3d> it works better for name processing than any other expression I have ever found
[01:38:42] <Whirl3d> *working on v2 as we speak
[01:39:31] <Whirl3d> Hopefully to include things like :"the all powerful and exaulted Chee of the great clan jQuery.."
[01:40:40] <prometh> hi
[01:40:47] <Hooloovoork> Whirl3d: what are you making?
[01:40:58] <Whirl3d> ?eval 'Sir William Thomson".match(/^(?:([a-zA-Z]{2,4}\.){0,1} ?([a-zA-Z]{2,24})) ([a-zA-Z]{1,1}\. ){0,1}([a-zA-Z]{2,24} ){0,2}([A-Za-z']{2,24})((?:, ([a-zA-Z]{2,5}\.?)){0,4}?)$/)
[01:40:59] <bot-t> Whirl3d: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[01:41:04] <prometh> say i have <a href="#"><strong>something</strong> else</a>   .... how would i change the string "else" ?
[01:41:13] <Whirl3d> A simple contact form. LOL
[01:41:17] <prometh> $("a").text() seems to show everyhting
[01:41:41] <chee> Whirl3d: note that 'sir' is not a first name, nor is it followed by a .
[01:41:52] <Hooloovoork> Whirl3d: lol! overkill much?
[01:42:07] <Whirl3d> Hooloovoork, yeah. I get bored easily.
[01:42:29] * prometh has a quick question above
[01:43:11] <Hooloovoork> prometh: i'm sure Whirl3d knows. i hate regex. it's all just doodles and encrypted to me.
[01:43:36] <prometh> i shouldn't need regex for this.. i really wouldn't want to work around html with regex for this
[01:44:09] <prometh> using regex for html is an absolute last resort
[01:45:32] <Hooloovoork> prometh: ohh i can do it without regex
[01:45:45] <Whirl3d> var txt=$("a").html().replace("/<strong>.*<\\strong>/","")
[01:46:14] <prometh> i really don't want to use regex
[01:46:32] <prometh> there's got to be a way to avoid html and just change the string
[01:48:15] <mindis|wurk> i suppose you could take the content, remove all tagged material, modify the remains and then reinsert the elements in front of it
[01:48:46] <mindis|wurk> but that comes with some obvious limitations and might not work for what you really want
[01:49:22] <prometh> sounds like regex
[01:49:36] <prometh> i'll just add a <span> then :)
[01:50:10] <mindis|wurk> no, i'm pretty sure it could be done with jquery but if you have the option of using a new element then that would obviously be easiest
[01:50:34] <Whirl3d> $($("a").html()).not("strong");
[01:50:45] <Whirl3d> lol, I dunno
[01:54:29] <prometh> ah, hmm
[01:55:16] <coldhead> prometh: http://jsfiddle.net/u85eK/
[01:55:17] <prometh> hehe, doesn't work :)
[01:55:39] <prometh> ugh, don't like that
[01:55:42] <prometh> thank you, though!
[01:55:50] <prometh> i just added a <span> wrapper
[01:55:59] <mindis|wurk> you sure have weird limitations
[01:56:05] <prometh> ?
[01:56:10] <prometh> what limitations?
[01:56:26] <mindis|wurk> regexp is not okay, coldhead's solution isn't okay...
[01:56:33] <prometh> yeah
[01:56:35] <coldhead> my solution is awful
[01:56:36] <prometh> i like neat, simple things
[01:57:34] <Hooloovoork> prometh: you could rip out the a element, save the strong element, make a new a element, instert strong element then just append your string =P
[01:57:42] <Hooloovoork> that's a horrible way of doing it too tho
[01:57:43] <coldhead> you want to do it in one line http://jsfiddle.net/u85eK/1/
[01:57:56] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/qQGUA/29/
[01:58:43] <coldhead> right let's get drunk
[01:59:00] <Hooloovoork> coldhead: \o/
[01:59:09] <Whirl3d> var txt=$("a").text().replace($("a").find("strong").text(),"")
[01:59:31] <Whirl3d> );
[01:59:57] <prometh> i was hoping there was something much simpler, like text("asdf", true) or some shit
[02:00:07] <prometh> which would do gthat shit behind the scenes
[02:00:11] <prometh> i don't wanna dirty my code
[02:00:15] <Hooloovoork> prometh: it's easy if you put the text in a span or something
[02:00:17] <prometh> i like the <span> idea
[02:00:20] <coldhead> write a plugin!
[02:00:32] <prometh> coldhead: not worth it for this :)
[02:00:39] <coldhead> it would be like a 6 line plugin
[02:00:46] <prometh> and besides, i avoid plugins
[02:00:49] <Hooloovoork> and no one would use it
[02:00:50] <coldhead> that you could treasure for the rest of your life
[02:00:52] <prometh> i tried hard to avoid jquery!
[02:01:00] <prometh> i've already written plugins
[02:01:01] <Whirl3d> you got nerve
[02:01:17] <prometh> i like jquery, just not its filesize overhead
[02:01:33] <Hooloovoork> prometh: make a lite version
[02:01:36] <Hooloovoork> jquery lite
[02:01:43] <prometh> i don't have the time
[02:01:46] <Hooloovoork> begin with removing the load function
[02:01:49] <Hooloovoork> it's useless
[02:01:54] <prometh> load is ajax?
[02:01:59] <Whirl3d> or just quit wasting our time just cause you don't like the size...
[02:02:00] <Hooloovoork> yea sorta kinda
[02:02:27] <prometh> i want javascript 2.0 :(
[02:02:30] <prometh> but it got cancelled
[02:02:42] <Hooloovoork> harmony is coming soon
[02:03:01] <Hooloovoork> the dom api is still a mess though
[02:03:05] <Hooloovoork> afaik
[02:03:40] <prometh> when actionscript 3 came out, adobe released the javascript version of the engine
[02:03:55] <prometh> but then ecmascript 4 was abandoned and with it, javascript 2.0
[02:04:00] <prometh> woulda been a great future
[02:05:17] <Hooloovoork> prometh: ummm
[02:06:59] <coldhead> the javascript we have right now is the one we'll be stuck with for years to come
[02:07:11] <coldhead> like it or write in something else and compile to it
[02:07:29] <Hooloovoork> coldhead: so how far away is harmony?
[02:07:48] <coldhead> i don't expect to use it in my lifetime
[02:07:54] <coldhead> but i am pretty old
[02:08:21] <Hooloovoork> you'd have to be since i think most modern browsers have at least partial support for it
[02:08:41] <prometh> ecmascript 4 is awesome
[02:08:48] <prometh> was gonna be javascript 2.0 ... some assholes fucked that up
[02:08:53] <coldhead> perl6 is more finalised than harmony
[02:09:08] <prometh> wow, a new perl
[02:09:12] <coldhead> harmony is for javascript navel gazers
[02:09:16] <coldhead> i pity them
[02:09:18] <prometh> perl5 is like, what, 15 years old?
[02:09:24] <Hooloovoork> i'm not saying it's done, i'm sayig you can use it.
[02:09:37] <Whirl3d> navel gazers...that's nice!
[02:09:50] <coldhead> i can use bits of it in some browsers
[02:09:53] <prometh> who stares at navels?
[02:09:57] <coldhead> that's not something clients want to hear :)
[02:10:40] <Hooloovoork> coldhead: no, but on the other hand you won't have much fun with anything if you aim for support for <ie10
[02:11:06] <D4> If I've successfully managed to create a "labyrinth" in canvas, how would I go about creating an image (or something) in jQ to take from A-B through this canvas? Any ideas or suggestions?
[02:11:10] <Hooloovoork> i use all the latest and greatest things for my own stuff, for work i'm more conservative
[02:11:27] <Hooloovoork> D4: jquery don't do canvas
[02:11:41] <D4> Hm?
[02:12:08] <Hooloovoork> D4: jquery doesn't have any canvas related features
[02:12:08] <coldhead> jQuery isn't designed for that domain, D4
[02:12:15] <coldhead> that's more of a javascript problem
[02:12:30] <e-anima> anyone ever realized some equalHeights, actually when the size of some of the divs could change (expanding menus) after loading the page. this somehow kills firefox. http://pastebin.com/48DEVknz
[02:12:51] <coldhead> D4: if you were using SVG you could do some cool pathfinding stuff
[02:12:51] <D4> Ah, then what would I 'draw' my labyrinth in to make jQ work with it so I can make something to go from point A > B?
[02:12:52] <coldhead> but noo
[02:13:14] <Hooloovoork> D4: you don't want to "draw" with jquery
[02:13:24] <Hooloovoork> you wanna draw with canvas using javascript
[02:14:12] <D4> (I am atm) and the output is in <canvas> but how would I create the part where I want something, preferably an image, to be able to go from A>B and basically take it through the labyrinth?
[02:14:47] <Hooloovoork> D4: you would have to ask someone who knows javascript. we only know jquery in here.
[02:15:13] <coldhead> D4: if you can ask tomorrow night toronto time vladikoff has just done something similar and can tell you why not to use jQuery
[02:15:23] <D4> coldhead » As in the labyrinth could be done as a SVG and then I could somehow use pathfinding in JQ to store a 'correct' path and basically disallow any other actions or whatever?
[02:15:56] <coldhead> D4: pathfinding in raphael
[02:16:04] <coldhead> or something else that isn't jquery
[02:16:07] <Hooloovoork> D4: forget jquery if you're working on this.
[02:16:08] <coldhead> forget about jQuery
[02:16:12] <coldhead> let it go
[02:16:19] <Hooloovoork> just drop jquery
[02:16:32] <coldhead> put down the jQuery and slowly back away
[02:16:32] <Hooloovoork> don't even load it in your html file
[02:16:44] <Hooloovoork> kick it over
[02:17:13] <coldhead> D4: http://raphaeljs.com/scape/
[02:17:51] <RishiKul> hi what would be jquery for onClick="this.value=''" where my 'input' textfield id is 'edit-submitted-street-address' which is inside div id 'webform-component-street-address'
[02:18:21] <coldhead> ?click @ RishiKul
[02:18:22] <bot-t> RishiKul, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[02:18:35] <coldhead> start there and put on some coffee, it's going to be a long night
[02:18:59] <RK_> hello ... i know it's a php function ... but so many people are helpful here :-) i'm doing a $id = isset($_GET['id']) ; and i dont understand why, the php is not reading the parameter value, it's giving me a "1" instead. any clue ?
[02:18:59] <RK_> me stupid.
[02:19:04] <RK_> sorry for the annoyance
[02:19:06] <RK_> argh
[02:19:11] <Hooloovoork> RK_: nope
[02:19:35] <Hooloovoork> i think people here are too helpful D:
[02:19:36] <D4> Thank you
[02:19:57] <RishiKul> coldhead: thanks
[02:20:02] <RK_> Hooloovoork: i'm stupid because my copy paste took the isset on the road ... and i havent seen that
[02:20:04] <coldhead> RK_: what does isset return?
[02:20:16] <RK_> coldhead: yep saw it
[02:20:28] <RK_> coldhead: add it to the wallof shame of today
[02:20:50] <RK_> it means that i must make a break
[02:20:50] <coldhead> too shameful for #php
[02:20:58] <coldhead> but just right for #JQuery
[02:21:08] <RK_> coldhead: ;-)

[02:29:52] <blackspotwiggins> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.onchange
[02:29:54] <blackspotwiggins> this one
[02:30:05] <[Anthony]> ok but with jquery one can apply change to anything right?
[02:30:10] <mady> hello friends
[02:30:20] <mady> i wanna query
[02:30:21] <blackspotwiggins> you can bind the event to anything, it does not mean it get's triggered
[02:30:36] <mady> i m starter of jquery
[02:30:53] <Hooloovoork> mady: query away!
[02:30:57] <mady> i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery
[02:31:17] <[Anthony]> I see
[02:31:23] <mady> but when i upload any attachment
[02:31:43] <mady> i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[02:31:47] <[Anthony]> I wonder what's triggerign it in the code I'm trying to understand then (it's not in a form)
[02:32:48] <mady> please help me out
[02:33:29] <RishiKul> how to write this using jquery <input name="Property City " type="text" class="property_city" id="username" onBlur="if(this.value=='')this.value=this.defaultValue;" onClick="this.value=''" onFocus="if(this.value==this.defaultValue)this.value=''" value="City"/>
[02:33:56] <mindis|wurk> mady your server side code provides you the location of the uploaded file on it, not jquery
[02:34:36] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[02:35:03] <mindis|wurk> repeating that won't change reality
[02:35:26] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[02:35:44] <mindis|wurk> :D
[02:35:46] <blackspotwiggins> why would browser send the full path? i thought they don't do that anymore
[02:36:09] <mady> not the browser i wanna get file full path
[02:36:30] <mady> it means c:/xampp/1.jpg
[02:36:42] <mady> but i getting only 1.jpg
[02:36:59] <[Anthony]> ah I see
[02:37:00] <blackspotwiggins> mady, and i want a golden pony that shits rainbows
[02:37:10] <[Anthony]> thanks
[02:37:25] <mindis|wurk> illiterates and internet, a wonderful combination
[02:37:30] <[Anthony]> now I just have to replicate this coming from RaphaelJS
[02:37:32] <mady> any one have solution of my problem
[02:37:36] <Hui_Nan> http://jsfiddle.net/ELftG/
[02:37:40] <Hui_Nan> heeelp
[02:38:05] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded i wanna get file full path
[02:38:14] <Hui_Nan> it looks like a chrome's problem
[02:38:35] <mady> no i m using firefox
[02:39:43] <mady> tell me
[02:39:57] <mady> how to sort out this problem
[02:40:51] <Hui_Nan> no, something is terribly wrong %-(
[02:41:32] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[02:41:57] <Hui_Nan> http://jsfiddle.net/ELftG/1/
[02:42:55] <fof> what's the problem Hui_Nan
[02:42:59] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[02:43:47] <Hui_Nan> finally I need a link over the text "qqq", but in browser I see only the text, no link
[02:44:08] <sahbeewah> you can't get the full file path via javascript
[02:44:09] <fof> i see a link
[02:44:28] <fof> in chrome 17
[02:44:44] <mindis|wurk> sahbeewah i already told him that
[02:44:46] <Hui_Nan> interesting...
[02:44:58] <mady> i wants to get using jquery
[02:45:10] <mindis|wurk> you can't, try to understand that
[02:45:19] <Hui_Nan> anyway it means I should do it in a more compatible way
[02:45:34] <mady> but i m getting file name
[02:45:37] <Hui_Nan> fof: could you suggest a solution?
[02:46:28] <Hui_Nan> xml is transformed to xhtml in a browser, loads jquery, then a script which has to add a working link to the final document
[02:46:41] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[02:47:12] <clawfire> hi everybody
[02:47:16] <fof> maybe it's because you're just appending a closing anchor? http://jsfiddle.net/ELftG/2/
[02:47:24] <fof> i think jQ will close the above
[02:47:40] <clawfire> i got a question, when i maje a $.getJSON, can i use some success, error callback like on $.ajax ?
[02:47:45] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[02:47:54] <mindis|wurk> stop spamming that
[02:49:21] <Hui_Nan> no it does not help
[02:49:48] <blackspotwiggins> clawfire, i think $.getJSON returns jqxhr object, you can attach .error() on it
[02:50:09] <Hui_Nan> BTW, to see the problem one has to upload the files to a webserver. in jsfiddle it magically works %-)
[02:51:12] <clawfire> thx blackspotwiggins  cause i got a pb using $.ajax with type GET , my data (json object) didn't been urlencode well
[02:51:22] <blackspotwiggins> ?
[02:51:37] <blackspotwiggins> you don't need to urlencode anything
[02:51:43] <fof> Hui_Nan: are you sure it's running on DOMReady event on your webserver?
[02:51:59] <Djj_> Could someone be kind enough to give me a hand and help me out with the following error: $.put is not a function I am getting in firebug. The error is pointing to L148 in the page source http://pastie.org/3393602. But I cannot see where I've gone wrong. If someone could advise me please.
[02:52:30] <blackspotwiggins> well, jquery does not have a put function
[02:52:45] <Hui_Nan> fof I believe $( function () { ... } ) means just that
[02:53:22] <elfrancesco> hi
[02:53:34] <clawfire> blackspotwiggins, you can see the begining of my code here https://gist.github.com/1844027
[02:54:00] <fof> forgot $(handler) :p
[02:54:54] <clawfire> blackspotwiggins, i got a $.ajaxPrefilter working to add all data after a p= on my url and it didn't seems to encode json well to be passed over get url :(
[02:54:57] <Djj_> blackspotwiggins: Was this response "well, jquery does not have a put function" for me?
[02:55:00] <blackspotwiggins> clawfire, why do you manually stringify?
[02:55:13] <blackspotwiggins> Djj_, yes
[02:55:32] <Djj_> blackspotwiggins: I found this blackspotwiggins
[02:55:38] <Djj_> http://homework.nwsnet.de/news/9132_put-and-delete-with-jquery
[02:56:10] <clawfire> blackspotwiggins, IDK  :s i'm not the author of this part of code, i just need to work on it
[02:56:32] <blackspotwiggins> clawfire, how can you work with it if you don't understand it?
[02:56:50] <blackspotwiggins> Djj_, just use $.ajax with method: "put"
[02:57:17] <blackspotwiggins> and if the guide you are following is 3.5 years old, it's a good chance it does not work
[02:57:49] <clawfire> blackspotwiggins, i try to understand it. It' seems to take a json object and stringify it ... I suppose it's a good choise if we put the json object on a GEt argument ...
[02:58:07] <Djj_> blackspotwiggins: I found a question on stackoverflow and it says that it will work
[02:58:48] <blackspotwiggins> clawfire, send the arguments as usual, you need to process them on the serverside anyway
[03:00:27] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[03:00:29] <Djj_> blackspotwiggins: If I use the example provided can i create a seperate file and call my post?
[03:00:39] <blackspotwiggins> wat?
[03:00:47] <Seubeu> hi Guys ! A question about $.on() and new element added to dom via Ajax -> http://pastie.org/3393631
[03:01:20] <clawfire> blackspotwiggins, if i didn't use JsonStringify, the calling url is something like http://client.sponsotel.com/api.php?m=put&u=http://api.sponsotel.com/societes/&[object%20Object]
[03:01:47] <Djj_> blackspotwiggins: http://pastie.org/3393643 That is a part of an addcell() function I have that contains my put, so if i was to use the example provided and created a separate js file would this work?
[03:01:56] <beasty> noon all!
[03:02:11] <astropirate> Hello
[03:02:17] <beasty> is there a channel for the plugins ?
[03:02:30] <astropirate> this is it
[03:02:32] <beasty> ok
[03:02:56] <Seubeu> clawfire: you cannot retrieve the path as [Object Object] you need to serialize it
[03:03:21] <beasty> i have an issue with 'uniform' ... for some reason the select list is malformed on the ipad, and i can't find anything about it on the internet
[03:03:23] <fof> Hui_Nan: sorry cant help much, can only suggest maybe trying to add a fully-formed anchor
[03:03:39] <clawfire> Seubeu, yep that's why I got a JSON.stringify() in my ajaxPrefilter i think
[03:04:33] <Hui_Nan> fof: thank for trying ^-)
[03:05:39] <Seubeu> clawfire: Oh ok ;)
[03:06:21] <Zogot> Seubeu: you need to apply live to the holder of where the element is getting added
[03:06:24] <Zogot> not the element itself
[03:07:25] <Seubeu> Zogot recording to doc : As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated
[03:07:27] <clawfire> Seubeu, but the pb is the string json representation is not suitable for passing as get argument
[03:07:32] <Seubeu> That's why i used On
[03:07:35] <Zogot> sorry live or on
[03:07:56] <clawfire> Seubeu, i think i need to urlEncode it or something like this
[03:08:08] <Zogot> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:08:11] <fof> Hui_Nan:  e.g. $("<a>").append("<a href = " + href + " >" + text + "</a>")
[03:08:12] <Zogot> scroll down to the last example
[03:08:15] <Zogot> Seubeu
[03:08:33] <Seubeu> clawfire could you paste your json string you have ?
[03:08:39] <clawfire> yep
[03:09:14] <blackspotwiggins> ffs if you are urlencoding json as a param, you are doing it wrong
[03:09:18] <Seubeu> Oh ok ! got It i'll try thx Zogot
[03:09:25] <fof> well, you would append that not to <a>, heh
[03:09:45] <clawfire> Seubeu, https://gist.github.com/1844110 you can see avec &p= the stringified json
[03:09:46] <blackspotwiggins> fof, nested <a> is not a good idea
[03:10:49] <Zogot> Seubeu: http://jsfiddle.net/7K2j8/7/
[03:11:59] <fof> sorry wasnt suggesting nesting it
[03:12:13] <fof> didnt mean to append to <a>
[03:12:32] <Seubeu> clawfire have a look to this : http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_decodeuri.asp
[03:13:25] <Seubeu> Thx Zogot for you time ;)
[03:13:52] <clawfire> Seubeu, so it's an encodeURI i need
[03:14:25] <Seubeu> Decode it I think
[03:14:37] <Seubeu> because it looks already encoded
[03:15:07] <clawfire> so it's to do server side ... 'cause i give your the url generated by my js client side
[03:15:17] <clawfire> and call with $.ajax
[03:16:28] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[03:17:08] <Whirl3d> who is an admin that can block this spammer?
[03:17:11] <Djj_> If i have the following: .put("/" + getDiaryId() + "/slot_days/" + getSlotId + "/slot_times/" + 0, slot_time); and I am going to do a ajax request using a PUT method, what would my url be?
[03:17:55] <sean`> Djj_, ??
[03:18:03] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[03:18:33] <sean`> mady, try saying it one more time
[03:18:55] <Seubeu> you might something similar in PHP or else
[03:19:00] <Seubeu> have*
[03:19:02] <clawfire> Whirl3d, juste /ignore him
[03:19:11] <Whirl3d> done, thx
[03:19:14] <sean`> who's spamming?
[03:19:29] <clawfire> sean`, mady
[03:19:38] <sean`> Djj_, you can just console.log ("/" + getDiaryId() + "/slot_days/" + getSlotId + "/slot_times/" + 0) to see the url
[03:19:43] <mady> i wanna query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[03:19:45] <sean`> LOL
[03:19:47] <sean`> haha
[03:20:02] <clawfire> clear
[03:20:05] <mady> i m using php
[03:20:34] <sean`> mady, if you want to get the full path, meaning absolute path, you need to pass that from your PHP to your frontend
[03:21:02] <mady> my dear i m using jquery mobile framework
[03:21:20] <Djj_> sean: If i have the following code:  http://pastie.org/3393604 if you see on L80 I do a PUT I now need to do an ajax request
[03:21:23] <mady> so i can t use php while procesing jquery
[03:21:51] <mady> i have query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[03:21:58] <clawfire> Seubeu, thx for the help, I set processData to false on ajaxSetup and use a custom ajaxPrefilter who encodeUrI(JSON.stringify(options.data)); and it's works
[03:22:06] <Djj_> so that when you click the plus button it will send update the capacity attribute in my  slot_time table
[03:22:27] <clawfire> now i need to understand why my php wrapper didn't send this string to my api :p
[03:22:34] <crem> Need to generate iframe contents from javascript. Trying to do $("iframe#myiframe).contents().find("html").html(myGeneratedHtml), but it removes <head>, <body> tags, and inserts only contents of them. What am I doing wrong? The same behaviour if i try $(myGeneratedHtml). $('iframe').contents().find("html")[0].innerHTML = myGeneratedHtml works fine.
[03:23:21] <mady> i have query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[03:25:15] <gnagno> hello all, I am using jqueryui, I'd like to attach both click() and .draggable() to the same element of my page, how can I understand when the user is just clicking or when he is dragging ?
[03:26:09] <Djj_> anyone have any ideas how I can do this. I've made somewhat of a start http://pastie.org/3393767...However I don't know what my URL will be. Please excuse me if a lot of it may be wrong I haven't really had to work with ajax request till now
[03:26:21] <mady> i have query i m making mobile compose mail page using jquery but when i upload any attachment i cant get the full path of the file which is uploaded
[03:27:30] <mindis|wurk> repeating that won't make the impossible possible
[03:45:29] <niels__> let's say I have something like $(".whatever).each(function(e) { checkThis(something) }); And I want it to delay 3 seconds before doing the next one, how would I do that the easiest way?
[03:49:23] <nFFF> niels__ setTimeout?
[03:49:41] <Whirl3d> var func=function (el) {el.css("color',"red").delay(5000).next().each(func);} func($(".whatever").first());
[03:50:17] <Whirl3d> --ugly
[03:53:18] <niels__> nFFF and Whirl3d: I did it like this $(".whatever).each(function(e) { setTimeout(function() { checkThis(something) }, 2000*e); });
[03:55:20] <nFFF> why *e
[03:55:24] <nFFF> and not just 2000?
[03:55:57] <nFFF> You want it to wait longer for each subsequent element?
[03:57:02] <niels__> nFFF: yes
[03:57:35] <nFFF> But you want the time between checkthis to be the same
[03:57:38] <nFFF> or different
[03:58:43] <niels__> Lets say I have 5 divs called .whatever, then i want to checkthis() on the first. then wait 5 seconds. checkthis() on the second. then wait 5 seconds. etc etc.
[03:58:46] <Whirl3d> because .each is applied to each element, you want to wait longer for each element
[03:59:19] <subdesign> hi
[03:59:21] <nFFF> Ah ok, your code should work fine then
[03:59:41] <nFFF> although not sure if you need the function(){} around checkThis
[04:00:24] <subdesign> is it easy implement if I select a specific option like "Others.." then a new text input appears below?
[04:00:31] <Whirl3d> var func=function () {var nxt=$(this).next(); //do stuff var t=setTimeout(func, 2000);} $(".whatever").first().apply(func);
[04:01:19] <Djj_> Could someone please confirm whether or not I have set this up correctly http://pastie.org/3393879 thank you
[04:01:38] <nFFF> Whirl3d, his code should work fine
[04:01:53] <Whirl3d> subdesign, http://jsfiddle.net/qQGUA/24/
[04:03:01] <niels__> nFFF: Great. How would you do it without wrapping checkThis with the function(){} =
[04:03:11] <subdesign> Whirl3d, you were quick :)
[04:03:32] <subdesign> thanks
[04:03:38] <Whirl3d> We had that question earlier tonight...np
[04:04:36] <nFFF> $(".whatever).each(function(e) { setTimeout('checkThis(something)', 2000*e); }); function checkThis(cT){ }
[04:16:45] <krucial> hey everyone, i've noticed that the .on() function has issues with html 5 button tags, when it comes to the "click" event.  However, other events, like "mouseover", in use with "on", work fine
[04:17:00] <Hooloovoork> krucial: you got a example?
[04:17:26] <krucial> I could try to make a jsfiddle pretty quickly
[04:17:40] <Hooloovoork> cause button tags shouldn't work any different from any other element when it comes to that stuff afaik
[04:18:18] <Whirl3d> I want to do something like this: var defaultOpts={allowBlank:false, customVal:"custom", defaultVal:function () {return($(this).find("option").first().val());}   if I use that object definition in the context of $("select").each(function () {console.log(defaltOpts.defaultValue);}); will it defer evaluating "defaultVal" for each select element?
[04:19:22] <Hooloovoork> Whirl3d: it should
[04:19:59] <elfrancesco> hi
[04:20:01] <Whirl3d> so I don't need to do defaultOpts.defaultVal.apply($(this))...
[04:20:36] <Hooloovoork> Whirl3d: only one way to be 100% sure =D
[04:20:40] <Hooloovoork> elfrancesco: yo
[04:21:15] <elfrancesco> i am having trouble with the following code : http://jsfiddle.net/8wKVe/
[04:21:43] <Hooloovoork> elfrancesco: the step from that to having a working example is really short D:
[04:21:57] <elfrancesco> oups sorry
[04:22:14] <elfrancesco> didn't read well i guess
[04:22:43] <elfrancesco> may i ask just a question without code ? i don't think it's might be a difficult answer for most of you i guess since i am new
[04:22:55] <Hooloovoork> ask away
[04:23:05] <Whirl3d> hoolovoork, nice try. I have, one more occasions than not, got the result to work the way I wanted because of some special circumstance that TIAS gave me a false result. There are lots of varialbes to consider and often TIAS works only for a very specific test case. That's why it's nice to have experts like #jquery that know the special circumstances to be aware of.
[04:23:06] <elfrancesco> its about the .on("click",function...)
[04:23:53] <mindis|wurk> i'm sure there's a question coming eventually
[04:24:16] <Hooloovoork> probably
[04:24:25] <elfrancesco> when i call the $(".myclass").on("click",.....) event the event succesfully register for existing elements with class "myclass". When i add a new element with class my class, the on click doesn't trigger
[04:24:34] <Whirl3d> lol, gnite all. Thanks for the great conversation/information/entertainment/etc.
[04:25:04] <Hooloovoork> nite Whirl3d
[04:25:12] <swe_ET> delegate it
[04:25:16] <elfrancesco> good night Whirl3d
[04:26:06] <elfrancesco> swe_ET: as i read, delegated is deprecated and should be replaces by on ... but maybe i misunderstood it
[04:27:01] <Hooloovoork> elfrancesco: you have to do $(".elementthat's a parent to .yourclass you want the event on").on("click", "childselector of the elements you want the click event on", function() {})
[04:27:33] <Hooloovoork> if i was wrong on the syntax it's all in the docs
[04:27:52] <swe_ET> isnt it .live that's deprecated?
[04:27:53] <elfrancesco> oh ok
[04:28:06] <krucial> Hooloovoork: I can't reproduce this in jsfiddle at the moment, seems to work fine
[04:28:12] <elfrancesco> sorry i didn't read it correctly will try that thanks Hooloovoork
[04:28:29] <Hooloovoork> swe_ET: i bet all the ways to bind events will dissapear but .on
[04:28:50] <Djj_> mauke: I have the following function http://pastebin.com/mHDeQ09k I now have a seperate file with the following: http://pastebin.com/1M5AQRkS. Do bare in in mind i am still new to using jquery
[04:28:51] <Hooloovoork> at least i hope so. right now there are 4 ways to do almost the same thing, and they could all be replaced by .on
[04:30:08] <swe_ET> didnt Hooloovoork want to trigger on NEW elements?
[04:30:55] <Hooloovoork> swe_ET: i don't want to trigger anything on any element right now
[04:31:02] <swe_ET> Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from descendant elements that are added to the document at a later time.
[04:31:23] <Hooloovoork> swe_ET: on can do that too
[04:31:35] <swe_ET> i pasted from doc
[04:32:34] <Hooloovoork> swe_ET: not sure what you're talking about right now...
[04:32:52] <swe_ET> sorry nevermind
[04:33:43] <elfrancesco> thanks again Hooloovoork  it works great now
[04:34:06] <niels__> nFFF: the time integer i actually pass as a variable, because it depends how long the timeout should be. And not wrapping the function won't work, atleast I can't get your code to work. It just stalls.
[04:34:29] <Hooloovoork> elfrancesco: no problemo!
[04:38:05] <nFFF> niels__, as long as it works wrapped in the function it doesnt really matter

[05:09:09] <aqeel> hi room
[05:09:46] <aqeel> "span#mmcstatus>ul>li:nth-child(2n)"........................jquery not accepting this input
[05:09:47] <Hooloovoork> hi aqeel
[05:10:12] <aqeel> id on span having ul aqnd li as flow.....
[05:10:25] <aqeel> li, ul>li working fine
[05:10:37] <nFFF> Not sure you can have li:nth-child(2n) as a child
[05:10:43] <aqeel> but i want to get it mto specific li
[05:10:43] <nFFF> Dont think its valid
[05:11:17] <aqeel> ul>li:nth-child(2n)...works a ok
[05:12:00] <nFFF> Oh ok
[05:12:04] <nFFF> why the span before the ID?
[05:12:13] <nFFF> its redundant
[05:12:28] <nFFF> your id is unique anyway
[05:12:58] <aqeel> that has id on it and i have couple of ul,li ....thus each ul have span before it
[05:13:04] <aqeel> yup it  is
[05:13:19] <aqeel> i ties ....just to see works or not
[05:13:34] <aqeel> tried*
[05:14:02] <aqeel> this is what i used..."#mmcstatus>ul>li:nth-child(2n)"
[05:14:11] <aqeel> but somehow it is not working

[05:14:43] <aqeel> ok...
[05:19:35] <aqeel> guys really sorry site has evolved in its design can't put in jsfiddle...need to go to site.....
[05:19:54] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[05:19:54] <Eviltwin> You need to learn how to isolate your errors
[05:20:06] <Eviltwin> Get to the specific problems
[05:20:24] <Eviltwin> Problems specific enough to be done in about a dozen lines of HTML, JavaScript/jQuery , and CSS
[05:20:27] <elfrancesco> is there a way to use $(this) in a function called inside an event to act asif the code was running in the event function's context ? actually i use something like $("...").click(function(){ myfunction(this,some,other,params)} to be able to use this but i have to make my function definition like myfunction(context, param1,param2,param3) {...}
[05:21:23] <Eviltwin> elfrancesco: myfunction.call(this,some,other,params)
[05:21:34] <Eviltwin> With myfunction(param1,param2,param3)
[05:22:44] <elfrancesco> ok Eviltwin  thanks and that mean i can use this in my function and it will have the same value as in the parent calling function ?
[05:22:56] <aqeel> u see i have chosen every second li floated it right.....so it keeps same distance from its container ul.....just like those float left....but in that the function i used is not accepting my input
[05:23:30] <aqeel> $(function(){$("#mmcstatus>ul>li:nth-child(2n)").css( "float", "right" );});
[05:23:37] <acies> is there an easy way to add raf back into jquery without breaking anything?
[05:27:22] <Hooloovoork> raf?
[05:28:29] <acies> requestAnimationFrame
[05:29:42] <Hooloovoork> oh
[05:29:48] <elfrancesco> thanks Eviltwin it works like a charm
[05:29:57] <Hooloovoork> no clue. i suppose you could hack it
[05:31:06] <Eviltwin> acies: Why?
[05:31:59] <Eviltwin> It was removed because of undesirable behaviors
[05:32:14] <Eviltwin> Such as it not firing if the browser wasn't the frontmost application
[05:32:19] <aqeel> guess i have to assign class to ul to have my job done
[05:32:37] <aqeel> i thought i might use parent relationship to get it done
[05:32:42] <johey> Is it ok to setup an timeout eventtrigger from one function to itself, or will it be an infinite recursive call growing the memory allocation?
[05:33:00] <acies> that's not as problematic
[05:33:30] <johey> Here is my code: http://www.ready.nu
[05:34:02] <johey> It's the blinking cursor I am asking about.
[05:38:27] <aaronmcadam> anyone ever seen a submit event firing twice
[05:40:25] <aqeel> $(function(){$("#mmcli>li:nth-child(2n)").css( "float", "right" );});...................id on ul
[05:40:29] <aqeel> this works
[05:40:59] <aqeel> i thingk nth child does not work when out of their parents....but that should not be the case?
[05:42:03] <mindis|wurk> aaronmcadam i guess it could happen if you don't stop the default one
[05:44:43] <aaronmcadam> ignore me i was being stupid, had duplicate ids
[05:48:05] <aqeel> always use validator ......if these problems pop up...

[06:07:17] <Wiz_KeeD> hey guys, if i try to find the sum of numbers in a group of input fields

[06:07:50] <Wiz_KeeD> now this is ok but if there is no value there it breaks everything, should i just add a if condition to it or is there a simpler method i am not aware of?

[06:12:33] <pramdev> What is sort create?
[06:12:52] <pramdev> like what does that mean?
[06:16:41] <xec> pramdev: dunno. context?
[06:17:36] <pramdev> in the sortable function, there is an event called sortcreate
[06:17:43] <pramdev> when exactly is it?
[06:18:08] <pramdev> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#event-create
[06:18:26] <xec> "This event is triggered when sortable is created"
[06:19:33] <xec> if you want to do something when creating a sortable, you can listen to that event
[06:20:25] <pramdev> when is sortable "created"? It's just a property that we set to it right?, like draggable
[06:21:05] <pramdev> like for example if I have some image list that is sortable..when is the create event?

[07:06:12] <LukeNukem> Zogot, i used your code, im having the php code on the same page(it runs on post request) the emptydiv shows the entire page, i dont want that..i just want it to show javascript popups
[07:06:26] <LukeNukem> datatype: 'script' << i added this, but does not work.
[07:07:50] <LukeNukem> SOMEBODY PLEASE
[07:08:53] <xec> LukeNukem: does it work if you just visit the url manually?
[07:09:20] <LukeNukem> what do u mean
[07:09:33] <xec> does the url actually work?
[07:09:43] <LukeNukem> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/kEKtd/
[07:09:49] <LukeNukem> thats what im using
[07:09:58] <LukeNukem> i just added datatype: 'script',
[07:10:01] <LukeNukem> and then i dont get any results
[07:10:11] <xec> LukeNukem: what is that supposed to do
[07:10:26] <LukeNukem> send a post ajax request
[07:10:56] <LukeNukem> ive coded the php script to show the errors and success message in javascript(so that would be the output) but its showing the entire page twice on form submit
[07:11:06] <LukeNukem> on a single screen, i just want the javascript output..how can i do this
[07:11:24] <xec> LukeNukem: i see, you just post back to whatever page you are on? or are you missing a url option?
[07:11:44] <LukeNukem> i just post back to whatever page im on
[07:11:53] <LukeNukem> but i did add the url option anyway.
[07:12:54] <LukeNukem> so xec i only want javascript oututs
[07:12:59] <LukeNukem> its showing entire page twice and thrice in my case.
[07:13:22] <xec> LukeNukem: you normally get back the entire page after a post request, right?
[07:13:24] <DerekPioneer> i have a list of thumbnails like "<div><img src /><img src /></div>"
[07:13:31] <DerekPioneer> one of these imgs has the class ".selected"
[07:13:38] <DerekPioneer> when i add a thumbnail dynamically using jquery
[07:13:40] <LukeNukem> xec, yea
[07:13:48] <DerekPioneer> users can still click on the other images and change the ".selected" class
[07:13:59] <DerekPioneer> but they can not click on the one thumbnail i added dynmacially
[07:14:02] <LukeNukem> the errors in the register script(type in username type in a password) are in a javascript pop up box, i just want to show those instead of the entire page twice or thrice
[07:14:04] <LukeNukem> on the same screen
[07:14:31] <xec> LukeNukem: so post to a php script that gives you back what you want
[07:15:16] <LukeNukem> i want to reduce the amount of php files.
[07:15:26] <xec> ?demo @ DerekPioneer
[07:15:27] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:15:30] <LukeNukem> is what im trying to achieve not possible?
[07:16:11] <stndoostds> Derek Pioneer I guess that is classical delegate problem
[07:16:20] <xec> LukeNukem: when making a http request to the server, you are left with server technologies to create a response
[07:17:01] <xec> DerekPioneer: what stndoostds said. how are you binding the click event?
[07:17:32] <DerekPioneer> xec: stndoostds: $('#thumbnails').find('img').not('.selected').on('click', function(event,ui)
[07:17:34] <LukeNukem> xec, well this is a register user function ive writte, it outputs results in javascript..everything works but it shows the html too..
[07:17:48] <LukeNukem> i dont want it to show html.( i can do this by putting the code in a seperate process php script but i dont want to to reduce mess )
[07:18:13] <LukeNukem> if the register php script is in the same page then it shows the page twice and thrice and more depending on form submit
[07:18:17] <xec> DerekPioneer: right - you are looking for images *once* and binding to those
[07:18:43] <LukeNukem> xec, see if you can reach http://117.207.236.66
[07:18:44] <DerekPioneer> xec what do i need to do instead?
[07:18:44] <k0954342> Hi can someone who has some RoR knowledge and jquery knowledge. I have more or less finished a js table that has been ajaxed so that when you click the "+" and "-" the capacity attribute increases/decreases in the slot_times entity. However having click either buttons and navigating to another screen I am logged out
[07:18:49] <xec> DerekPioneer: anything added to the dom (or changed) later will not have the event bound
[07:19:15] <k0954342> *Hi can someone with some RoR knowledge and jquery knowledge help me please
[07:19:23] <xec> DerekPioneer: you could do something like $("#thumbnails").on("click", "img" function...)
[07:19:51] <xec> DerekPioneer: change the "img" to "img:not(.selected)" or check inside the function for the class, for instance
[07:19:59] <stndoostds> DerekPioneer: xec: thats right what xec: told
[07:20:06] <xec> there should be another comma in there
[07:20:11] <xec> but you get the point? :)
[07:20:17] <kkuno> hi
[07:20:17] <DerekPioneer> yes i think so
[07:20:24] <DerekPioneer> i clearly need to do some jquery studying
[07:20:28] <kkuno> I'm loading a php file using load() function
[07:20:30] <stndoostds> if you still have a doubt
[07:20:31] <DerekPioneer> because these solutions are working but i don't understand why
[07:20:42] <k0954342> in my show page I included the javascript by doing it the rails <%=javascript_include_tag ajax_request_PUT%> and found that when this is included i am logged out and vice versa. i now have a feeling that something is conflicting and cannot seem to identify it
[07:20:51] <zfmf> he guys i have this line but its not working, can anyone say me whats wrong: $(element).find("tr.odd").next("tr").not($(this)).hide(); i want hide all second tr but leave this open
[07:21:04] <stndoostds> DerekPioneer: xec: this makes concepts clear http://learnjquery.tutsplus.com/
[07:21:25] <DerekPioneer> stndoostds: thanks
[07:21:48] <xec> DerekPioneer: well, i just attached a click event handler to the entire "#thunbnails" and it will check if you click on an "img", rather than attaching a click event to a set of imagets
[07:21:50] <xec> -t
[07:21:50] <stndoostds> DerekPioneer: especially day 10 explains theseeee delegation and why you run into those issues
[07:21:52] <kkuno> I'm loading a php file using load() function, I added a gif image when the page is loading... the problem is that the gif is stopped when the page is loading and then animates when load() finish
[07:22:01] <fof> this is also good: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[07:22:09] <kkuno> which is not a correct behaviour
[07:22:13] <kkuno> any hints?
[07:22:35] <Joeytje50> hi, does anyone know if there is a way without using loops, to check if there is an element with class "test" that has content "test worked"?
[07:23:22] <xec> ?has @ Joeytje50
[07:23:23] <bot-t> Joeytje50, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[07:23:27] <lazyPower_work> Is it common for JQueryUI to add a div wrapper during animation init?
[07:23:29] <xec> erm
[07:23:32] <xec> ?:has @ Joeytje50
[07:23:33] <bot-t> Joeytje50, :has(selector): Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[07:23:41] <xec> hmmm thats not right either is it
[07:24:13] <lazyPower_work> I've got a realy compact design thats getting munched while jquery ui adds its divwrapper to start the animation. once its done the layout goes back to normal but hte collapse is a quandry i cant seem to fix.
[07:24:22] <Joeytje50> no xec
[07:24:45] <Joeytje50> I could also use a forloop to go past all the elements to check if their .html() == 'test worked'
[07:24:56] <Joeytje50> but I was wondering if there would be a simpler way
[07:25:23] <xec> yeah, i don't know a way
[07:25:31] <poppiez> I have this object: function Test(options) { this.options = options; }; var x = new Test({ x: 1 }); var y = new Test({ x: 2 }); when I console.log(this.options.x); inside 'x' the value is 2. why is that?
[07:25:33] <Joeytje50> okay will use the loop then
[07:25:53] <xec> ?:contains @ Joeytje50
[07:25:54] <bot-t> Joeytje50, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[07:25:55] <xec> woot
[07:26:08] <xec> ?botsnack
[07:26:09] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM

[07:29:19] <nights`> hi
[07:32:42] <nights`> im having an issue that my jquery UI tabs fire in IE8 but not in IE9
[07:32:46] <nights`> and i cant figure out why
[07:32:52] <nights`> anyone care to help me out?
[07:34:42] <xec> nights`: can you reproduce the issue at jsfiddle.net ?
[07:36:11] <nights`> xec: no, i cant..
[07:36:39] <nights`> here is the page however.
[07:36:49] <nights`> in case you would happen to run both IE8 and IE9
[07:36:55] <noviolence> I want to use JQuery UI Sortable - it's not working. I assume that is the case because the ul with the li that should be sorted are also generated by JS. How can i solve this issue?
[07:50:54] <DEac-> hi
[07:51:06] <Guest23550> Why on earth does sortable not just give you the new/old position when you're workng with lists
[07:51:10] <Guest23550> STUPID.
[07:53:10] <ABitDim> Does $.ajax use the default proxy automatically?  I turned on Fiddler but can't pick up the traffic.
[07:57:05] <JuJuBee> I am  having trouble with http://pastebin.com/kvSgk1xx  .  I cannot get the alert to trigger if I set the datepick.  If I remove the datepick the alert works.  Any help>
[07:57:16] <xec> Guest23550: i'm not sure what you're after, but have you looked at ui.originalPosition and ui.position on sortchange?
[07:59:05] <noviolence> JQ UI sortable on dynamically created content, anyone?
[07:59:16] <poppiez> any way to isolate $.extend so that you don't need jquery? jquery's extend method is the best out there for deep recursion
[08:00:35] <henrico> anybody from california here plz pvt-me
[08:01:30] <chee> lolwat
[08:01:45] <JuJuBee> It seems that the alert only happens if I manually change the date in the textbox, not if I change it with mouse selecting new date?  Why is that?
[08:02:33] <elb0w> I know js doesnt have pointers but is it possible to get any type of address for that object?
[08:02:45] <elb0w> I want to use an object as a key
[08:03:35] <johnkpaul> elb0w: JSON.stringify I think is probably the best solution, but there's this you can look into http://www.timdown.co.uk/jshashtable/
[08:03:50] <elb0w> will that convert a html5 object?
[08:04:59] <johnkpaul> what is an "html5 object"?
[08:05:23] <justinhjohnson> similar to manbearpig
[08:05:48] <\monster\> hey guys, is there a build in function for getting a URL parameter value?
[08:06:17] <johnkpaul> \monster\: I don't think jQuery has a built in, but it's not difficult to write one
[08:06:18] <davemo> window.location.query
[08:06:33] <johnkpaul> oh, cool
[08:06:50] <johnkpaul> is that a standard?
[08:07:04] <davemo> sorry
[08:07:07] <davemo> window.location.search
[08:07:43] <johnkpaul> oh, that doesn't create an object out of it
[08:07:54] <johnkpaul> it just gives you the string post ?
[08:08:05] <johnkpaul> or it doesnt' give you the value directly
[08:09:05] <davemo> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[08:12:20] <henrico> anybody from NY or california plz pvt-me, and NO i'm not trying to date anybody here
[08:13:15] <john-dev> henrico, what a pity!
[08:13:25] <chee> (
[08:13:29] <rickard> Hi, looking for a method to count the children of div's that has the css class images, have googled it for a while, but cant find a solution...
[08:13:43] <john-dev> rickard, .length()
[08:13:45] <chee> i had already typed /q henrico before i got to the comma
[08:14:03] <pflock> can I somehow pass parameters to jquery-functions? I want to make a new post in forum, in javascript I would do that with function(text, author, date). How can I do something like that with jquery?
[08:14:19] <john-dev> $('#div').find('images').length()
[08:14:24] <john-dev> or use children
[08:14:26] <chee> henrico: i notice your boundaries have widened
[08:15:45] <chee> henrico: if they widen again from NY the same distance as they have from Cali
[08:15:47] <chee> count me in
[08:16:08] <henrico> chee: yes now i have options
[08:16:29] <henrico> and i'm trying to make up my mind by gathering some information
[08:16:35] <chee> ahh
[08:16:44] <henrico> about these places
[08:17:02] <henrico> have we met here already chee?
[08:17:07] <chee> what it's like to live and work in california, that kind of thng?
[08:17:12] <chee> I'm not sure
[08:17:44] <henrico> so how can you tell my boundaries have widened?
[08:17:50] <john-dev> you guys could change numbers
[08:18:23] <chee> henrico: before 20 minutes ago you said
[08:18:36] <chee> 'Anybody from california here pls pvt-me'
[08:18:47] <henrico> hmm i said that
[08:18:49] <chee> and now you say
[08:19:00] <henrico> are you from any of these palcies?
[08:19:01] <chee> 'Anybody from NY or California pls pvt-me, no kissing'
[08:19:20] <chee> so i notice a widening boundary of around 3000 miles
[08:19:29] <chee> no, I am about 3000 miles away from NY again
[08:19:41] <chee> and so 6000~ away from California
[08:19:47] <henrico> in what direction?
[08:19:51] <chee> much to my chagrin and continual heartbreak
[08:19:58] <chee> henrico: this direction
[08:20:02] <chee> towards me
[08:21:27] <henrico> but i don't know your location
[08:22:24] <pflock> can I somehow pass parameters to jquery-functions? I want to make a new post in forum, in javascript I would do that with function(text, author, date). How can I do something like that with jquery?
[08:24:43] <Clex> pflock: what do you mean? Don't you just wanna use JavaScript?
[08:24:45] <jancel> jquery doesn't change the way javascript works.  You can pass arguments around in functions as necessary.  May want to look at how jquery handles options arguments, as I find it a clearer way to pass arguments.
[08:26:47] <pflock> doesn't anyone know?
[08:27:08] <JuJuBee> Is jquery.com down?
[08:27:17] <Clex> pflock: did you read our answers?
[08:27:32] <johnkpaul> JuJuBee: http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/jquery.com
[08:27:36] <johnkpaul> nope, not down for me
[08:27:44] <jancel> it's up
[08:28:03] <ump721> pflock: You pass in arguments to a function in JQ the same way you do in JS, do you have a specific example?
[08:28:05] <JuJuBee> hmmm strange.
[08:28:43] <pflock> Clex: sorry no didnt see it
[08:28:50] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone here know why when using jquery mobile the elements loaded by the jqm system with ajax are not affected by a script included in the header?
[08:29:28] <pflock> ump721: Yes, javascript: onclick="function(text, author, date)" (or with a event handler). How can I call it that way with Jquery?
[08:29:58] <pflock> ump721: Or do You mean just making a normal function like in javascript with Jquery Code inside?
[08:30:56] <losteyes> hello, anyone knowÂ´s how to make another ajax request posting something inside a page loaded by ajax?
[08:31:04] <jancel> jQuery Mobile IRC channel #jquerymobile on freenode.net @Wiz_KeeD
[08:31:07] <ump721> pflock: you want to use an onclick to trigger a jQuery function?
[08:31:17] <Wiz_KeeD> i did join there, absolutely nobody is talking
[08:31:21] <Wiz_KeeD> been trying for 3 days
[08:31:25] <Clex> pflock: maybe $('#selector').click(function () { your_func(text, author, date); });
[08:31:25] <Wiz_KeeD> just a bunch of idling pricks
[08:31:27] <c_t_montgomery> losteyes: use a callback function. so, within the success of the page loaded via ajax, you'll start another one
[08:31:41] <pflock> ump721: No thats just an example...its on sumbit
[08:31:48] <Wiz_KeeD> i would have taken a "i have no ideea" in that channel or an "hello" but it's never going to happen
[08:32:16] <pflock> Clex: Yeah but than I would have to put an onclick event in the html and also use the jquery way for onclick...
[08:32:20] <losteyes> a callback like XMLHttpRequest statechanged ?
[08:32:23] <ABitDim> Hello, does $.ajax use the default proxy on the PC?  I turned on Fiddler but could not pick up any traffic from an ajax call.
[08:32:41] <pflock> Clex: because with only $("selector").click() I'm not passing any arguments
[08:32:54] <ump721> pflock: put together a pastebin or jsfiddle and pm me a link
[08:32:55] <Guest23550> xec: THose are positions, not indexes
[08:32:58] <Guest23550> They're co ords
[08:33:21] <xec> Guest23550: indeed they are :) and position is what you said
[08:33:24] <losteyes> c_t_montgomery: like xmlHttp.onreadystatechange ?
[08:33:46] <Guest23550> xec: You say tomato, I say Tomati
[08:33:50] <Guest23550> * tomato
[08:33:55] <xec> hehe
[08:34:33] <c_t_montgomery> losteyes: similar, yes. but you can use jQuery to abstract that even more. why don't you put together a jsfiddle?
[08:37:06] <aqeel> ok guys a senario.......all li float left in css.....nth child floats all 3n(every thrid) li to right..... how to balance every 2n(every second) li in center of the two....

[08:51:35] <losteyes> hello, anyone can help me making an callback in a ajax function that loads a page to load another page when I click a link ?
[08:52:04] <losteyes> (that link is on the loaded page)
[08:52:23] <aqeel> call load on the page u loading via 2nd page into it
[08:52:47] <losteyes> how ?
[08:53:12] <losteyes> the 1st step itÂ´s done, I loaded the page but I cannot execute js functions on a page loaded via ajax
[08:53:38] <aqeel> can u load second page
[08:54:04] <aqeel> without third page contents
[08:54:10] <aqeel> if yes....
[08:54:14] <losteyes> Yes, iÂ´m using jquery load function
[08:54:23] <losteyes> IÂ´m loading the second page
[08:54:35] <losteyes> Now I need to load a 3rd page when the user click on submit button
[08:54:58] <aqeel> apply some id to second page and have it called similarly u called 2nd page but this time give it third page into 2nd page link
[08:55:40] <losteyes> do you have some example ?
[08:55:41] <rickard> john-dev, http://jsfiddle.net/7xhAS/
[08:56:37] <losteyes> the problem is: I want to add an listener on the submit button at the 3rd page
[08:57:30] <losteyes> so I prevent the default behavior and post the data to another page loaded via ajax
[08:57:53] <losteyes> the code is working but inside ajax not
[08:58:28] <losteyes> I was thinking in append the code in a div at the 1st page when the 2nd page where loaded
[08:58:53] <losteyes> so the 2nd page could use js functions
[08:59:04] <losteyes> but I donÂ´t know how to do that using JQuery
[08:59:53] <losteyes> anyone knows how to do that ?
[09:00:12] <aqeel> u can use window.load()
[09:00:30] <aqeel> or document.load
[09:01:32] <losteyes> my loader function looks like that http://pastebin.com/gYiwzWij
[09:02:36] <losteyes> Show I put window.load("appendchild,etc") after $('#centro_painel').load('paginas/'+this.id+'.php'); ?

[09:04:14] <mdel> microhxo: thats for you to figure out :)
[09:04:26] <mdel> $('.t-dropdown') would work
[09:04:36] <mdel> but that might not be right for your case
[09:04:57] <microhxo> yea i just want to remove from that specific div
[09:04:59] <microhxo> not all of them

[09:05:12] <chee> ?eval ~function(){}()
[09:05:13] <bot-t> chee: -1
[09:06:04] <aqeel> $('#centro_painel').load('paginas/'+this.id+'.php');......................u are missing some arguments...
[09:06:26] <aqeel> Note: The event handling suite also has a method named .load(). jQuery determines which method to fire based on the set of arguments passed to it.
[09:07:05] <aqeel> .load( url [, data] [, complete(responseText, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest)] )
[09:07:26] <aqeel> .load( handler(eventObject) )  handler(eventObject)A function to execute when the event is triggered. version added: 1.4.3.load( [eventData], handler(eventObject) )  eventDataA map of data that will be passed to the event handler.  handler(eventObject)A function to execute each time the event is triggered.
[09:09:06] <aqeel> microhxo u can use removeClass()
[09:09:52] <microhxo> This is the structure that its in
[09:09:54] <microhxo> http://paste2.org/p/1906215
[09:10:16] <microhxo> I want to remove  t-header   from this: <div class="t-dropdown t-header" style="width: 50px;">
[09:10:19] <john-dev> rickard, http://jsfiddle.net/kcV3R/
[09:10:39] <aqeel> $('t-dropdown').removeClass(' t-header');
[09:11:27] <john-dev> $('.t-dropdown').removeClass('t-header');
[09:11:29] <john-dev> :-)
[09:11:42] <aqeel> yeah.......thanks
[09:11:52] <john-dev> he would hve asked :P
[09:12:10] <rickard> john-dev, Yes thats correct. But I want to run it on the divs, I want to return the number of elements in the diffrent divs. It should return "2" three times.
[09:12:52] <john-dev> rickard, i dont get it :-/
[09:13:27] <john-dev> you mean you want to count the <span and the <script?
[09:13:31] <aqeel> $('.t-dropdown div2 div3 .class2 id ').removeClass('t-header');....chain it up
[09:13:47] <john-dev> aqeel, wrong person ;)
[09:13:51] <microhxo> It doesn't seem to have worked aqeel and john-dev. After running (no errors via firebug) the source still shows the t-header in the div.
[09:14:19] <john-dev> microhxo, do you access it using the id -> # or the class -> .?
[09:14:19] <aqeel> well do u have inline style?
[09:15:23] <rickard> john-dev, <div class="images" are placeholders on the site, and the js function will execute some code that will return an image, some divs or what's defined for that placeholder. If the placeholder looks like it does right now, with only two lines, we do want to mark that placeholder or hide it or something like that. :)
[09:15:53] <intellilogic> Anyone using jQueryUI Dialog?  $(...).dialog({ height: 530 }); //469.033px, WTF?  It's like zoomed in and doing funky calculations.  I'm trying to get things just right, anyone?
[09:16:16] <gnagno> I have a draggable element in my page, can I change its position programmatically ?
[09:16:55] <microhxo> This is my problem
[09:16:57] <microhxo> http://www.2shared.com/photo/nKOVNjJz/problem.html
[09:16:57] <NoiseEee> gnagno: sure, set css?
[09:16:59] <john-dev> rickard, what do you mean with "looks like it does right now" and with "only two lines"?
[09:17:03] <microhxo> No i do not have direct access to them
[09:17:16] <NoiseEee> 'access' how microhxo?
[09:17:37] <microhxo> The div that i want to remove the class from is generated on load
[09:17:41] <gnagno> NoiseEee, $("#element")css('position', ????? ) ?
[09:17:42] <microhxo> its a telerik grid.
[09:17:47] <microhxo> so i dont have direct access to the source
[09:18:06] <rickard> john-dev, Like this: <div class="images" id="k3a1" style="display: block; "><span class="Image__caption">Image:</span>
[09:18:06] <rickard>     <script type="text/javascript">getRightImage('k3a1', 'k3a1');</script>
[09:18:06] <rickard> </div>
[09:18:22] <NoiseEee> gnagno: sure?
[09:18:31] <gnagno> NoiseEee, mine was a question :)
[09:19:11] <NoiseEee> gnagno: http://api.jquery.com/css/
[09:20:10] <gnagno> thanks NoiseEee
[09:20:11] <microhxo> NoiseEee, aqeel, john-dev the problem is the left rounded corner. Apparently it is in t-header which i want to be rounded but the t-dropdown also pulls that. And it really doesn't need it. I fixed the problem in firebug by removing  t-header from this: <div class="t-dropdown t-header" style="width: 50px;">
[09:20:14] <aqeel> The div that i want to remove the class from is generated on load...............put your code after this div is generated
[09:20:34] <microhxo> I did
[09:20:59] <microhxo> i added  $('.t-dropdown div2 div3 .class2 id ').removeClass('t-header'); after the div is loaded
[09:21:53] <aqeel> noooooooooooooooooo.........$('.t-dropdown div2 div3 .class2 id ')............was to explain someone who wants to remove multiple items....
[09:22:24] <aqeel> $('.t-dropdown').removeClass('t-header');....this was yours
[09:22:50] <xec> http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
[09:23:17] <aqeel> lol xec
[09:23:29] <aqeel> nice one ;)
[09:23:41] <jon_x> bit of a newb question but how do I get attr from the event in a click?  I tried e.currenctTarget.attr("href") but that throws an error
[09:23:49] <microhxo> aqeel yea i did both
[09:23:53] <microhxo> it doesn't remove the class
[09:24:00] <microhxo> its still visible in source,.
[09:24:16] <microhxo> <div class="t-dropdown t-header" style="width: 50px;">
[09:24:17] <aqeel> ok try putting you code at the very end of the entire code
[09:24:23] <intellilogic> jon_x:  $(this).attr("href")
[09:24:35] <microhxo> I just did, i added it to the last line
[09:24:38] <microhxo> same result
[09:24:46] <aqeel> ok do this
[09:24:52] <jon_x> intellilogic: thanks I'll give it a try.. think I need another cup of coffe
[09:25:13] <john-dev> sry rickard, i don't get it :-/
[09:25:48] <aqeel> $(function(){$('.t-dropdown').removeClass('t-header');});
[09:27:10] <aqeel> microhxo?
[09:27:13] <rickard> john-dev, maybe I cant explain it so well... :/
[09:28:03] <john-dev> rickard, i reread that 10 times, i don't get it :-(
[09:28:37] <aqeel> to hide your div placeholder.....use some id on div.....then #div id{display:none;} in css
[09:30:32] <john-dev> microhxo, http://jsfiddle.net/nSMnQ/
[09:30:53] <john-dev> p.s. don't use .live as i did
[09:30:56] <john-dev> it's deprecated
[09:31:47] <rickard> john-dev, the thing I want is to count the number of elements in the different divs with the class images, and I want to get the value for each (as an alert right now for testing purpose) so; I want to loop trough the site, when I find a div, I want to count the number of elements (should be more than two if the function getRightImage has returned the correct value) and I want to alert the number. Then I want to go to the next div with the class images
[09:31:47] <john-dev> use .bind or .on (on requires jquery >1.7.1)
[09:31:48] <rickard> and do the same thing all over again...
[09:32:07] <john-dev> rickard, ok, i understood this..
[09:32:21] <rickard> john-dev, good :)
[09:32:47] <john-dev> let me check this out..
[09:32:51] <aqeel> ok room bye
[09:32:59] <aqeel> goodnight
[09:33:20] <rickard> john-dev, sometimes it's hard to transform the thoughts to words...
[09:34:09] <xec> rickard: do you have a sample of your markup?
[09:34:31] <rickard> xec, http://jsfiddle.net/7xhAS/
[09:35:04] <microhxo> aqeel sorry had to step out
[09:35:21] <benjamin_654> hello. can somebody pls tell me why this move animation is so jumpy ( only in crome ) : http://jsfiddle.net/XMLSw/1/
[09:35:41] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: you around?
[09:36:30] <john-dev> rickard, here we go.. http://jsfiddle.net/LnLE2/
[09:36:48] <xec> rickard: what does getRightImage() do?
[09:37:01] <john-dev> xec it calls a function
[09:37:05] <john-dev> :P
[09:37:12] <xec> rickard: also, have you heard of unobtrusive javascript? :)
[09:37:26] <rickard> xec, depending on the id it feches content to the div
[09:37:34] <microhxo> john-dev: that code works but i want to remove it on page load, not when i click on it?
[09:37:46] <muhoo> is this true: https://refheap.com/paste/767
[09:37:50] <rickard> xec, no, I have not.
[09:38:02] <john-dev> microhxo, so rewrite it, it was just added for testing purposes, you need help with this?
[09:38:16] <john-dev> rickard, that was what you are looking for right?
[09:38:20] <microhxo> Ill try and figure it out first
[09:38:21] <microhxo> thanks
[09:38:31] <xec> rickard: basucally, you should never mix markup and javascript - keep your javascript in external javascript file(s)
[09:38:54] <xec> basically*
[09:39:08] <john-dev> microhxo, http://jsfiddle.net/JTYh8/
[09:39:34] <rickard> john-dev, Not exactly...I cant change the html, I get that from another site right now and have to include it. Thats why my code is a bit "strange"
[09:40:06] <john-dev> rickard, you don't have to change it :-/
[09:40:13] <john-dev> i just added those script tags for testing purposes..
[09:40:17] <rickard> xec, I would love to, but it's not my code. I get that delivered from another page
[09:40:28] <rickard> john-dev, I will check again :)
[09:40:48] <john-dev> rickard, maybe you need another each for those images classes
[09:40:56] <john-dev> so you need each in an each
[09:41:07] <john-dev> sound's odd..
[09:42:26] <john-dev> rickard, here we go http://jsfiddle.net/BQBcu/
[09:42:29] <microhxo> john-dev:  the previous one worked, $('.t-dropdown').removeClass('t-header'); does not work.  When i was debugging the previous code.   $(this).removeClass('t-header');   "this" turned out to be div.t-dropdown
[09:42:43] <microhxo> i tried to do  $('div.t-dropdown').removeClass('t-header'); but that didnt work either.
[09:43:04] <john-dev> it's working on js-fiddle :-/
[09:43:12] <muhoo> sorry, i see these everywhere. are they really all the exact same thing?  https://refheap.com/paste/767
[09:43:38] <john-dev> muhoo, i don't know, did you try them all?
[09:43:52] <microhxo> idk :| it works on click but not alone.
[09:43:59] <john-dev> jquery and $ is the same, unless $ doesn't work in no conflict mode
[09:44:04] <muhoo> john-dev: i've used code that uses them all
[09:44:24] <muhoo> i was asking, not DO they all do the same thing, but are they all SUPPOSED to do the same thing?
[09:44:31] <john-dev> microhxo, that's not possible, did you use http://jsfiddle.net/JTYh8/ <- ?
[09:44:54] <john-dev> muhoo, ok, i really don't know it :-(
[09:44:57] <DukeDrake> hi
[09:45:11] <DukeDrake> how can I prevent the contextmenu to show up?
[09:45:22] <rickard> john-dev, thank you! :)
[09:45:35] <john-dev> rickard, you are welcome
[09:45:41] <DukeDrake> I tried event.preventDefault(); and event.stopPropagation(); but contextmenu will still show up?
[09:46:08] <johnkpaul> vivekm: so what are you trying to do
[09:46:17] <microhxo> john-dev: yes i did, it only works when i use the liveclick
[09:46:19] <microhxo> not on load.
[09:46:44] <john-dev> you shouldn'T use live
[09:46:49] <john-dev> did yu put it in the head tag?
[09:47:38] <john-dev> did you use the $(document).ready(function() { ?
[09:47:38] <microhxo> john-dev: Really interesting result
[09:47:40] <john-dev> it's needed
[09:47:45] <microhxo> when stepping through the code
[09:47:51] <john-dev> tell me about it
[09:47:53] <microhxo> it actually works up until a point
[09:47:54] <intellilogic> john-dev:  .on
[09:47:59] <microhxo> then it reverts back?
[09:48:08] <john-dev> intellilogic, he's using jquery 1.6.4
[09:48:17] <intellilogic> Upgrade...
[09:48:22] <john-dev> tell him..
[09:48:23] <john-dev> :P
[09:48:39] <john-dev> microhxo, can you post me the url in a pm?
[09:48:42] <intellilogic> Who is it, I just saw the "it's needed"  I'll tell em all!!!
[09:48:49] <vivekm> @johnkpaul, hi. was reading about jquery mobile... My app continuously receives data from server and creates html elements at different x,y position as sent by server.
[09:48:53] <intellilogic> <-  <3 .on
[09:48:57] <john-dev> me too
[09:49:01] <john-dev> loved .live too
[09:49:07] <john-dev> ffs it's deprecated
[09:49:07] <microhxo> john-dev: I cant unfortunately its not live.
[09:49:16] <microhxo> its not a small website. its a huge enterprise project.
[09:49:18] <john-dev> microhxo, hm ok.. let me think
[09:49:20] <vivekm> i was wondering if jquery mobile can be of any use to me.
[09:49:31] <microhxo> ill step through and see where it reverts back..
[09:49:34] <intellilogic> I used something before .live too...
[09:49:42] <intellilogic> or after...
[09:49:44] <johnkpaul> hmm, jquery mobile's purpose is to make it really really easy to build widgets that look and feel right in mobile browsers without needing to go native
[09:49:52] <intellilogic> there was something else in that evolution
[09:49:59] <johnkpaul> something taht custom wouldn't benefit much, unless you have a navigation that matches jquery mobile's usual
[09:50:04] <johnkpaul> did you look at the demo vivekm?
[09:50:29] <kevindanko> Hello im looking for something rather simple and lightweight.....im trying to essentially create an image slider that shows about 900x wide area which contains 4 x 150px image icons, with a next and previous button, a next button in the front, previous button at the end...
[09:50:49] <johnkpaul> kevindanko: jCarousel or jCarouselLite
[09:50:49] <kevindanko> clicking the next would scroll forward and previous would scroll backwards
[09:51:11] <kevindanko> <<  icon1    icon 2   icon 3 >>  then clicking the >> reveals icon 2, 3 and 4 hiding 1
[09:51:24] <kevindanko> ive tried those and i cant get the level of customization i want
[09:51:31] <kevindanko> ^ johnkpaul:
[09:51:35] <vivekm> oh yes, checked those. but I am not sure if I need all that functionality. performance is important to me
[09:51:38] <john-dev> kevindanko, show us your code on jsfiddle.net
[09:51:42] <kevindanko> the icons have to be links as well
[09:52:05] <johnkpaul> kevindanko: nothing you've said so far is outside of jCarousel IIRC
[09:52:24] <kevindanko> johnkpaul:  I've tried using it but can't get the link functionality down.
[09:52:34] <kevindanko> this is gonna be on wordpress just fwiw
[09:52:53] <vivekm> my app UI is more like google docs. cells at fixed positions, all processing on server side and server will tell client about position of each element.
[09:53:01] <johnkpaul> what is the link functionality?
[09:53:10] <johnkpaul> vivekm: then no, I highly doubt that jquery mobile would buy you aything
[09:53:32] <johnkpaul> vivekm: I'd recommend just trying out their demo on your phone/mobile device
[09:53:53] <johnkpaul> jquery mobile is like an extjs or Swing of mobile dev
[09:54:07] <vivekm> I feel I can still use it to show some preference dialog etc but main html generator should be free from jquery mobile
[09:55:01] <vivekm> @johnkpaul, sure will explore demos more.
[09:55:33] <kevindanko> johnkpaul: just basically click the icon and take you to the page
[09:55:46] <kevindanko> <a href="link"><img src="img.png"></a>
[09:56:05] <kevindanko> in jcarousel i can easily insert the image
[09:56:10] <kevindanko> but the anchor
[09:56:16] <kevindanko> not*
[09:56:24] <johnkpaul> kevindanko: I'm pretty sure that jCarousel just takes whatever is inside the list item
[09:56:34] <johnkpaul> can you give us a fiddle of this behavior?
[09:56:46] <johnkpaul> if you have <li><a href="link"><img src="img.png"></a></li>
[09:56:51] <johnkpaul> it should work fine
[09:57:12] <kevindanko> ill try again, maybe it was just the plugin version
[09:57:15] <johnkpaul> http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/dynamic_flickr_api.html
[09:57:18] <johnkpaul> there's an example
[09:57:27] <johnkpaul> of links with anchor ags
[09:57:28] <johnkpaul> tags
[09:57:45] <kevindanko> johnkpaul: that's what i want, perhaps its just the port of the plugin
[09:57:56] <johnkpaul> port?
[09:58:10] <johnkpaul> why aren't you using the one from the jcarousel site?
[10:01:54] <kurrata> hi, i have <select> ellement. why doest attribute gets added to it when i run $("select").attr("multiple","multiple");?
[10:02:14] <kurrata> ican put tr/td and other stuff in it and it works then
[10:02:31] <kevindougans> hey i've got a "form" http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16690569/Screen%20Shot%202012-02-16%20at%2018.58.41.png and i want that when i assign it an category from drop down box and click "approve" it will then send the tweet and category to an ajax handler and i have this so far: http://pastebin.com/ue9hAfF0 but i want to find a way that i only have to send the specific tweet and category and not all of them on the page. can anyone hel
[10:03:57] <Stephen> kurrata: Are you sure the element has been rendered?
[10:05:35] <john-dev> kevindougans, five those fields an unique id
[10:05:38] <john-dev> give*
[10:06:01] <john-dev> and use $(this).attr('id')
[10:06:12] <kevindougans> thats what i was thinking, i have given each one a unique id but how do i get the info
[10:06:16] <kevindougans> ahhhh $(this)
[10:06:20] <kevindougans> i knew i was forgetting something
[10:06:22] <kurrata> Stephen: lol, thanks. 1 of my tables hasen't rendered jet and it didnt work for it
[10:06:27] <kevindougans> thanks john-dev
[10:06:34] <john-dev> (this) is the "button" (in your case) which has been clicked
[10:06:35] <john-dev> yaw
[10:09:48] <Cryp71c> I know you can use .html() to get the content of a selected element, but can I get the content of the selected element AND the selected element's html?
[10:10:18] <Cryp71c> eg, in '<div id="test">testy test</div>' I want everything, including the div declaration (and its id attribute) as well as "testy test"
[10:10:38] <john-dev> Cryp71c, .html is for adding content.. you want .text()
[10:10:43] <Cryp71c> thansk
[10:10:58] <benjamin_654> Cryp71c: parent().html() ?
[10:11:11] <john-dev> attr('id') =  id, .text()=the text between
[10:12:23] <Cryp71c> john-dev, actually that doesn't seem to return anything but an excessive amount of whitespace.
[10:12:30] <john-dev> hehe
[10:12:34] <john-dev> you are doing it wrong
[10:12:35] <john-dev> ^^
[10:12:45] <john-dev> show me your code using jsfiddle.net
[10:13:56] <Cryp71c> john-dev, http://jsfiddle.net/DwnKM/
[10:14:41] <john-dev> uh
[10:14:45] <john-dev> let me repeat
[10:14:49] <john-dev> you are doing it wrong
[10:15:12] <john-dev> what data do you want to get?
[10:15:27] <john-dev> onChange doesn't support this
[10:15:32] <john-dev> i think :-/
[10:15:39] <Cryp71c> ...the onchange fires just fine.
[10:15:52] <john-dev> use $('#cdFilePath_1').on('change'),function..
[10:16:09] <john-dev> you shouldn't add your code to an onChange
[10:16:21] <trollboy> anyone got a reason this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/7BnrV/
[10:16:30] <Cryp71c> Ajax page, registering triggers like that is a massive pain.
[10:17:06] <john-dev> trollboy, .on('hove',function..
[10:17:09] <john-dev> hover*
[10:17:29] <Cryp71c> john-dev, furthermore, the onchange event is firing fine, Just trying to get all the html contained within and including the <div tag which contains the input.
[10:17:58] <john-dev> so you want the onChange to receive itself?
[10:18:40] <john-dev> Cryp71c, maye .html wasn't that wrong than..
[10:18:45] <trollboy> john-dev: please elaborate?
[10:19:04] <Cryp71c> if I do $('#cdFilePath_1').parent().html() I only get the <input type="file"...
[10:19:09] <Cryp71c> I need the containing div's HTML as well.
[10:19:20] <Cryp71c> and chaining another .parent won't work, the div in this example has numerous siblings.
[10:19:25] <Qalqi> is some thing similar to sql injection possible in jquery too?
[10:19:52] <Cryp71c> Qalqi, yes, you can edit the javascript of a page with any number of simple tools.
[10:20:05] <Cryp71c> Chrome has webkit, firefox has firebug, etc. (these are all standard dev toosl)
[10:20:09] <john-dev> Cryp71c, so the .html is working, but only the first html object is catched?
[10:20:17] <Qalqi> How to secure our website designs from such issues?
[10:20:42] <Qalqi> It scares the shit out of me
[10:20:50] <john-dev> Qalqi, don't allow to add <script> tags for example
[10:20:51] <Cryp71c> Qalqi, you...can't? You can use absurdly complicated javascript to try and limit or prevent it, I've seen some pages where you can't open up firebug under certain circumstances.
[10:21:03] <Cryp71c> john-dev, that's still easy to get around.
[10:21:21] <john-dev> Cryp71c, ok, dont't allow "<"
[10:21:22] <john-dev> ^^
[10:21:45] <Cryp71c> Qalqi, you can't secure against it, its completely against the paradigm of how the content is presented to the user. You're trying to limit a client from editing a client-side object, the onlything you can do expect or ask a user to self-police.
[10:21:56] <trollboy> john-dev: $(".menusubcontent div").on is not a function
[10:22:01] <Cryp71c> Furthermore, if you have some site based security which relies on javascript obscurity, you really need to not be developing anything web related.
[10:22:09] <Cryp71c> You should og work on becoming an electrician, or a farmer.
[10:22:41] <john-dev> trollboy, remove that div or set it to the beginning
[10:22:43] <Cryp71c> john-dev, regarding my issue, its not that the object is not cached. .html() gets the CONTENT of an element, it does not get the HTML of the elemtn itself. This is detailed on the jquery page.
[10:22:56] <Cryp71c> You don't seem to be any more educated on this than I am. I'll return to googling for an answer.
[10:23:15] <john-dev> Cryp71c, good idea..
[10:23:33] <ajpiano> Cryp71c: see ?g jQuery outerhtml yelotofu
[10:23:34] <bot-t> Cryp71c, jQuery: outerHTML | Yelotofu - http://www.yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/
[10:25:21] <kevindougans> john-dev: i have gave the select boxes a data attribute and with $(this).attr('data-tid'); its bringing the correct id number up but how do i get the value of the drop down from that?
[10:26:57] <kevindougans> var test1 = $(this).attr('data-tid').val(); // doesn't work "object t1 has no method 'val'
[10:28:51] <Mkop> ?.attr
[10:28:52] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[10:29:16] <Mkop> .attr already returns the value of the attribute
[10:29:20] <john-dev> var test1 = $('#'+$(this).attr('data-tid')).attr('data-tid').val();
[10:29:36] <john-dev> var test1 = $('#'+$(this).attr('data-tid')).val();
[10:30:45] <kevindougans> yyyaaaaaas john-dev you are a bleeding legend
[10:30:58] <losteyes> Anyone know how I select an element loaded via ajax ?
[10:31:27] <trollboy> losteyes: target it?  $('#AjaxGeneratedDiv').dostuff()
[10:31:39] <kevindougans> still getting to grips with jquery. can plug and play any plugins but writing my own still baffles me sometimes.
[10:32:05] <Stephen> losteyes: Has the element been placed on the dom yet?
[10:32:13] <john-dev> kevindougans, google: jquery .<function> is your friend :-)
[10:32:13] <Cryp71c> ajpiano, anyway to do multiple find/replace aside from calling .replace twice? (eg, find 'abcdefg' replace with 'alphabet' and find '123456' and replace with 'numbers')
[10:32:27] <losteyes> I donÂ´t know because I didnÂ´t used ready at loaded div
[10:32:33] <losteyes> I donÂ´t know how to target it
[10:32:40] <krz> anyone used pluupload?
[10:32:54] <trollboy> losteyes: got a url?
[10:32:55] <losteyes> I am trying $("#AjaxGeneratedDiv script");
[10:32:59] <Cryp71c> losteyes, what client are you using for your irc?
[10:33:22] <losteyes> Cryp ?
[10:33:44] <losteyes> sorry ?
[10:33:50] <john-dev> losteyes, use .on('click' or something
[10:33:59] <Cryp71c> Its replacing the standard ASCII character apostrophe (') with the extended-charset apostrophe that MS Office (aggrivatingly uses) (´)
[10:34:00] <john-dev> .bind won'T work for elemts, loaded after the dom has finished loading
[10:34:10] <Cryp71c> rather aggrivating.
[10:34:18] <losteyes> thanks
[10:35:22] <john-dev> if you want to directly trigger something after the vent has been loaded using .load (or another ajax feature), trigger it directly after that function has finished loading
[10:36:07] <losteyes> hmm
[10:36:31] <losteyes> and can I pass the loaded stuff as parameter ?
[10:36:54] <losteyes> $('#centro_painel').load('paginas/'+this.id+'.php');
[10:36:54] <losteyes> newTag();
[10:36:56] <LukeNukem> Hello, i have a form with works with ajax to submit. i also have setup with form action to work even if javascript is disabled.
[10:37:05] <LukeNukem> but the form does nothing if javascript is disabled.
[10:37:10] <LukeNukem> its supposed to submit the form as usual
[10:37:12] <losteyes> then I use newTag(loadedstuff)
[10:37:41] <losteyes> cuz I am trying to transfer the content of a div in the loaded page to the main page
[10:37:47] <john-dev> losteyes, use $.ajax than with the onSuccess event
[10:37:58] <john-dev> instead of .load
[10:38:04] <losteyes> ok, thx
[10:38:33] <john-dev> LukeNukem, hm.. you mean as fallback for ppl without javascript?
[10:39:14] <john-dev> Show us your form using jsfiddle.net
[10:39:29] <LukeNukem> john-dev, yes
[10:40:03] <john-dev> LukeNukem, show us your form
[10:40:16] <LukeNukem> sorry jsfiddle is messed up for some reason i cant paste anything in there, cant even see any of the four textfields
[10:40:18] <john-dev> btw, stop supporting ppl without javascript :P
[10:40:25] <john-dev> so use pastebin.com
[10:40:56] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/844761/
[10:41:04] <LukeNukem> i know, those idiots.
[10:41:48] <LukeNukem> this is like really simple, i set form action..i use jquery to prevent default action and do an ajax request..if javascript is disabled, no jquery hence no preventing of default action
[10:41:53] <LukeNukem> and the form submits to the action page like normal.
[10:42:15] <john-dev>  <button id='register_btn' class="action greenbtn"><span class="label">Register</span></button> <- this won't work
[10:42:47] <john-dev> you click a text which doesn't submit the form
[10:43:19] <john-dev> unless you use, well, javascript
[10:43:26] <noviolence> $( '#abc' ).sortable();  -> assume #abc doesnt exist : shouldn't i get a err message in the console? Is there a way to get error messages in the console for sth like this?
[10:45:02] <john-dev> noviolence, jquery doesn'T care if #abc exsits or not
[10:45:44] <noviolence> ah, crap john-dev â€” I don't get this sortable going and am not sure why
[10:46:25] <john-dev> noviolence, you should add an event handler to this sortable right
[10:46:26] <john-dev> ?
[10:46:34] <john-dev> .sortable( { â€¦ }
[10:47:19] <noviolence> I'm sorry, i can't follow john-dev
[10:48:37] <LukeNukem> john-dev, awww
[10:48:56] <LukeNukem> okay
[10:49:04] <john-dev> noviolence, show me your code please..
[10:49:11] <john-dev> using http://jsfiddle.net
[10:49:35] <LukeNukem> john-dev, i think i will set a cookie using javascript, check using php if it exists..if it exists show that if it does not exist show a input type='submit' thingie
[10:49:36] <LukeNukem> smart?
[10:50:30] <john-dev> nope
[10:50:33] <john-dev> use <noscript>
[10:50:39] <LukeNukem> what is that
[10:50:57] <john-dev> it's a fallback for browsers that doesn't support javascript
[10:51:05] <john-dev> (or disabled)
[10:51:08] <LukeNukem> nice
[10:51:12] <LukeNukem> so i just add within that script eh
[10:51:12] <john-dev> indeed
[10:51:25] <john-dev> give it a try, use it jsut for the button
[10:51:33] <LukeNukem> so is this how websites like facebook check if javascript is enabled or not
[10:51:36] <LukeNukem> or use the cookie method
[10:51:46] <john-dev> well, you kinda can't check
[10:51:56] <LukeNukem> <noscript>
[10:51:56] <LukeNukem> </noscript>
[10:52:01] <john-dev> same has html5, you can't check which video src has been choosen
[10:52:04] <syborg> Is there a way to attach a global ajax success callback that is always run in addition to any local callback? Something like $.ajaxSetup but add the callback rather than just setting defaults.
[10:52:06] <LukeNukem> is that the script?
[10:52:15] <noviolence> john-dev, i think my real proplem is, that the content is not available when the sortable is supposed to happen cause the content also is being output with jquery .. it's for a google chrome extension .. http://jsfiddle.net/DkXXV/
[10:52:29] <john-dev> syborg, i don't think so
[10:52:40] <ajpiano> syborg: use a prefilter
[10:53:02] <ajpiano> syborg: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/
[10:53:22] <syborg> ajpiano: I will take a look, many thanks
[10:53:47] <LukeNukem> sawweeet
[10:53:48] <john-dev> noviolence, you mean the content doesn't exists when the dom finished loading?
[10:54:07] <john-dev> ajpiano, nice!
[10:54:16] <LukeNukem> john-dev, well if i use noscript it shows both buttons
[10:54:19] <LukeNukem> i just want it to show either one
[10:54:26] <john-dev> LukeNukem, sure
[10:54:28] <john-dev> ^^
[10:54:33] <john-dev> it's a normal text
[10:54:38] <john-dev> any browser can show this :-/
[10:54:52] <john-dev> hmh
[10:54:55] <noviolence> yes, john.dev .. the content is appended with the jquery and i don't know how i can get the jquery ui instruction to wait till that is done
[10:55:01] <LukeNukem> what i mean is, your saying that my current button does not work because it needs javascript enabled
[10:55:02] <LukeNukem> eitherway.
[10:55:08] <john-dev> LukeNukem, show it using javascript with document.write
[10:55:09] <LukeNukem> whether i use ajax or not right?
[10:55:20] <LukeNukem> Smaart
[10:55:24] <john-dev> ^^
[10:55:38] <john-dev> maybe not the best way but.. yea, a way
[10:56:06] <LukeNukem> aint that cookie way hell of a lot epicer
[10:56:24] <john-dev> hm, it says "Enable a group of DOM elements to be sortable."
[10:56:51] <john-dev> you could add this $(..).sortable after .load :-/ (maybe)
[10:58:05] <noviolence> I'll try, thanks
[10:58:07] <john-dev> You'll need to call .sortable() again after adding/removing new elements. Do this on the "success" handler in jQuery.ajax.
[10:58:08] <LukeNukem> john-dev, ok the form still does not work :\
[10:58:14] <john-dev> don't know if this will work, enver tried..
[10:58:17] <john-dev> LukeNukem, hehe
[10:59:19] <kevindanko> im trying jcarousel lite but its not working its like it doesn't like the js http://pastebin.com/ShiQjDTR
[10:59:28] <john-dev> LukeNukem, show me your button
[10:59:59] <john-dev> syntax highlighting..
[11:00:11] <DerekPioneer> i'm having a weird problem with ui-draggable in firefox, draggable image just flickering back and forth in a really buggy way
[11:00:34] <LukeNukem> its just a normal <input type='submit' value='Register'/>
[11:00:47] <john-dev> LukeNukem, nothing happens when you click that button?
[11:00:50] <LukeNukem> did not work so i got rid of documentwrite thinking its something wrong with php
[11:00:51] <DerekPioneer> http://bit.ly/Akvdb7   , click on the photo of the black couple and upload a file if you want to recreate it (sorry, i couldn't figure out a way to recreate this error without a fresh upload)
[11:00:52] <noviolence> try adding z-index to the images DerelPioneer
[11:01:01] <LukeNukem> john-dev, POST request is sent, but the script is not run i think
[11:01:19] <DerekPioneer> noviolence: trying that now, it's weird it works in chrome and safari
[11:01:23] <john-dev> which script?
[11:01:27] <LukeNukem> the php script
[11:01:28] <DerekPioneer> and other ui-draggable stuff works on the page
[11:01:44] <LukeNukem> hell, i should put out a message "Please expect shitty service since you have javascript disabled"
[11:02:12] <john-dev> LukeNukem, maybe a php error?
[11:02:49] <LukeNukem> yea
[11:04:50] <john-dev> DerekPioneer, why is the picture loading each time i move a title?
[11:05:11] <DerekPioneer> what do you mean?
[11:05:16] <DerekPioneer> you mean if you move the textboxes?
[11:05:25] <john-dev> y
[11:05:34] <DerekPioneer> that's just the way it has to interact with the imageserver
[11:05:43] <john-dev> you have a savebutton :-/
[11:05:50] <DerekPioneer> doesn't work
[11:05:54] <john-dev> k
[11:06:00] <DerekPioneer> do you want to make a greeting card?
[11:06:00] <DerekPioneer> lol
[11:06:06] <DerekPioneer> getting married?
[11:06:22] <LukeNukem> john-dev, ok i put a echo in the php and it works, so the function is not running
[11:06:23] <LukeNukem> weird
[11:06:38] <DerekPioneer> the error is when you click on the photo of the couple and then upload an image
[11:06:44] <DerekPioneer> and then try to drag it around inside the preview box
[11:06:48] <john-dev> so the html/js is working, my job is done :P
[11:06:58] <LukeNukem> mine too.
[11:06:59] <LukeNukem> damnnn
[11:07:16] <john-dev> DerekPioneer, can't help you on dragable..
[11:07:18] <LukeNukem> IDEA(I HAVE A PHP EXPOORT)
[11:07:21] <john-dev> LukeNukem, #php
[11:07:22] <john-dev> :-)
[11:07:26] <LukeNukem> its ## xD
[11:07:28] <noviolence> john-dev .. event-handler on .ajax ? but I'm not using .ajax to get the data
[11:07:32] <john-dev> you get forwarded^^
[11:08:38] <john-dev> noviolence, .load has no onSuccess function (iirk), $.ajax has..
[11:08:50] <ajpiano> ...
[11:08:55] <ajpiano> load has a success callback...
[11:08:55] <noviolence> but i don't use load or ajax
[11:09:01] <john-dev> ...
[11:09:07] <DEADB33F> Is there a general event I can use for 'link opened'?   Be it by left click, middle click, or tabbing & hitting enter.
[11:09:15] <john-dev> it has a return function
[11:09:44] <john-dev> Successful Response (should be blank):
[11:09:44] <john-dev> Error Response:
[11:09:44] <john-dev> Sorry but there was an error: 404 Not Found
[11:09:49] <john-dev> that's no onSuccess event..
[11:10:03] <john-dev> you got to build that on your own..
[11:10:38] <ajpiano> john-dev: when do you think the callback is fired
[11:10:49] <john-dev> on success and error
[11:10:50] <ajpiano> after the request has succeeded...
[11:10:51] <ajpiano> nope.
[11:10:55] <john-dev> well, everytime it's finished
[11:10:57] <DerekPioneer> john-dev: if i rotate an uploaded image left and then rotate it back right, ui-draggable works
[11:11:00] <DerekPioneer> again, this only happens in firefox
[11:11:03] <john-dev> complete(responseText, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest)A callback function that is executed when the request completes.
[11:11:34] <john-dev> so, you need to build your own success or not function..
[11:11:43] <john-dev> well, function = if / else statement
[11:12:03] <losteyes> joh-dev: I loaded and passed the page with parameter, now how can I select a element from data ?
[11:12:13] <losteyes> withing another function
[11:12:20] <losteyes> ex: data.$("#script");
[11:12:40] <losteyes> in js would be data.getElementById()
[11:12:55] <losteyes> how can I do that in Jquery ?
[11:13:15] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cTVWS/ - what's the best way of making "deals", "size groupings" and "styles" start with arrow_down.png as opposed to arrow_side.png?
[11:14:49] <john-dev> losteyes, i never found out, i used .html(data) and afterwarsm i pulled the data i needed
[11:15:05] <john-dev> afterwards*
[11:15:23] <DerekPioneer> why would adding a doctype to my document break my javascript/jquery
[11:15:26] <losteyes> I was thinking in select only a <script>...</script> at data
[11:15:28] <john-dev> i actually never tried..
[11:15:50] <john-dev> losteyes, you can .load only defined #divs
[11:16:10] <losteyes> not element by tag name ?
[11:16:31] <john-dev> $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container');
[11:16:38] <john-dev> i don't know.. give it a try..
[11:16:41] <losteyes> I am using $.ajax now
[11:16:52] <john-dev> ah, good choice :P
[11:16:59] <john-dev> $.ajax doesn't habe this seperator^^..
[11:17:25] <losteyes> I picked the data and passed by parameter to a function newTag(data);
[11:17:41] <losteyes> Now I want to select a <script>...</script> at the data page
[11:17:41] <john-dev> a workaround could be to add this data to a hidden div and pull the info you need, but that's poor, i don't know how to get the needed infos from a data object..
[11:17:51] <john-dev> i never tried as i said
[11:18:05] <losteyes> I am doing that to be able to use scripts at a loaded page
[11:19:29] <losteyes> actually I need to add a .submit event
[11:19:36] <losteyes> on a form at the loaded page
[11:20:03] <john-dev> add an on click to it's button using .on in the success callback
[11:20:08] <john-dev> :-/
[11:20:19] <john-dev> or earlier since it's .on
[11:21:11] <losteyes> I wanna use .submit instead of on click to give compatibility to the stupids who turn off js
[11:21:27] <john-dev> Oo
[11:21:38] <john-dev> .submit without javascript?
[11:21:56] <losteyes> the default behavior of submit will stay normal
[11:22:10] <losteyes> it will submit the page to the Action of the Form
[11:22:24] <krz> losteyes: forget about it. tell your users to use js
[11:22:38] <krz> its unlikely anyone would have js disabled nowadays
[11:22:51] <john-dev> ok, the submit buttons get's an id="x".. you use $('#x').on('click',function(event) { .. and use event event.preventDefault()..

[11:45:26] <muzone> At my toggleable side menu at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cTVWS/ (a replicate of http://www.target.com/c/women-clothing-tops/-/N-5xtbq#?lnk=nav_t_spc_1_inc_2_13) - how do I make "deals", "size groupings" and "styles" start with arrow_down.png as opposed to arrow_side.png?
[11:45:30] <muzone> This fixes it - http://jsfiddle.net/cTVWS/2/ - but there's gotta be a better way to do it?
[11:48:47] <h0axify> Anybody?
[11:49:25] <microhxo> How would i remove a textbox with the class FilterTextBox  from the th class t-header ?
[11:49:55] <microhxo> it is located in the first th  of class t-header
[11:49:55] <NoiseEee> microhxo: think it out, whats first?
[11:50:12] <NoiseEee> also, is it the only thing with the class FilterTextBox?
[11:50:28] <microhxo> No, there are 5 things with FilterTextBox
[11:50:35] <microhxo> i just need to remove the one found in the first TH
[11:50:41] <john-dev> microhxo, .remove()
[11:51:01] <NoiseEee> okay, microhxo, http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ and figure out what to do first
[11:51:06] <h0axify> Hello, can somebody help me with wrapAll()? http://dpaste.com/704084/
[11:51:08] <john-dev> use .detach if you still need it's data..
[11:51:29] <john-dev> h0axify, we don't write code, we help with it.. so try it first..
[11:51:37] <microhxo> $('th.t-header.FilterBox').remove();  i want to do something like that
[11:52:56] <h0axify> @john-dev:  $('div.twoselect_box:even').before('<div class="twoselect">'); Isn't working
[11:53:17] <h0axify> @john-dev: the same goes for :odd
[11:53:33] <NoiseEee> so start with what you said.  how to find the first <th> in something class .theader  what would be your guess after looking at http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[11:53:38] <multipass> how do i fix this appendto selector? $('.sales-force0 .legal').clone().appendTo($(this) + ' .form-insert-wrap')
[11:54:10] <john-dev> $(this) + ' .form-insert-wrap' cant work..
[11:54:36] <juha-> on average, i think i spend about 3 hours a day drawing on paul irish's blog..
[11:54:42] <losteyes> John-dev itÂ´s worked, thanks.
[11:54:53] <john-dev> yaw
[11:55:06] <multipass> ok, cant use this in a selector with other stuff?
[11:56:23] <john-dev> its a wrong syntax..
[11:56:41] <NoiseEee> multipass: what are you trying to do?
[11:56:51] <multipass> $(".form-insert-wrap", this)
[11:56:54] <multipass> is this correct?
[11:56:58] <john-dev> no^^
[11:57:02] <multipass> ack
[11:57:04] <NoiseEee> multipass: what are you trying to do?
[11:57:06] <john-dev> keep on guessing :P
[11:57:30] <multipass> NoiseEee: $('.sales-force0 .legal').clone().appendTo($(this) + ' .form-insert-wrap') -- trying to fix this appendto selector
[11:57:38] <multipass> so that it selects a div inside of "this"
[11:57:52] <multipass> oh crap
[11:57:53] <multipass> .find
[11:57:54] <multipass> duh
[11:58:14] <NoiseEee> multipass: figure out where you want to appendTo before you use appendTo
[11:58:16] <multipass> my bad lol, brain dosnt work
[11:58:25] <multipass> nah i got it, thanks
[11:58:58] <muzone> moooooltipaaaaaaasss

[12:00:16] <subliminal> I'm interested in writing plugins that are chainable but can have namespacing, like $.category.autocomplete().  The rearch I've done shows I should use Milan Adamovksy's plugin pattern and I just want to confirm that this would currently be the best approach for me to taking before I start implemntation.
[12:00:33] <muzone> multipass: hehe
[12:00:39] <ajpiano> subliminal: glwtd :/
[12:00:48] <ajpiano> milan's pattern seems balls-to-the-wall insane
[12:01:12] <subliminal> that's kind've what I thought but I havnt seen anyone even approach the idea else where yet
[12:01:16] <muzone> ajpiano: haha balls-to-thewall?
[12:01:25] <muzone> that doesnt sound too good
[12:01:29] <ajpiano> subliminal: that's cause it's not really a win, imo
[12:01:48] <ajpiano> like, having namespaced chainable methods that you like slop onto jquery
[12:01:53] <h0axify> @john-dev: still no luck. http://dpaste.com/704093/
[12:02:18] <ajpiano> it's like, you get a vague "organisation" win but introduce all sorts of ambiguities and unfamiliar paradigms left and right
[12:02:20] <subliminal> ajpiano, so in my case it's probably jsut better to pass my jquery wrapped element  to the methods i want and just go from there?
[12:02:39] <subliminal> and break the chainability part of it
[12:02:40] <muzone> At my toggleable side menu at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cTVWS/ (a replicate of http://www.target.com/c/women-clothing-tops/-/N-5xtbq#?lnk=nav_t_spc_1_inc_2_13) - how do I make "deals", "size groupings" and "styles" start with arrow_down.png as opposed to arrow_side.png?
[12:02:44] <muzone> This fixes it - http://jsfiddle.net/cTVWS/2/ - but there's gotta be a better way to do it?
[12:02:50] <ajpiano> subliminal: i would take a look at the various patterns demonstrated here https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns
[12:03:02] <subliminal> ajpiano, ok
[12:03:05] <ajpiano> and see one that gives you the combination of organisation and realistic use of jQuery API
[12:03:29] <john-dev> modulo, nice
[12:04:12] <john-dev> $('.twoselect_box:eq(i), .twoselect_box:eq(i-1)').wrapAll('<div class="twoselect" />');
[12:04:39] <john-dev> h0axify
[12:04:50] <djuggler> It would appear I've allowed my jquery fu to get rusty. I'm using an href to launch a modal.   $("#foohref").click()  ... dialog blah blah. That href has some query string info  foo.html?name=george&age=89&health=ok   Isn't there a simple way to get the value of age?
[12:05:04] <djuggler> The great google is indicating a lot of parsing.
[12:05:29] <john-dev> arg h0axify sry, im wrong
[12:05:38] <h0axify> @john-dev, modulo :) It's not graph theory or machine learning
[12:07:11] <john-dev> h0axify, should i be 0?
[12:08:22] <LittleFoot> hi
[12:08:31] <LittleFoot> im making a embedable widget
[12:08:36] <h0axify> @john-dev: I got it :) http://dpaste.com/704095/
[12:08:55] <john-dev> is it working?
[12:09:17] <LittleFoot> i am loading jquery by appending script to the head
[12:09:48] <LittleFoot> but its not loading in time
[12:10:19] <h0axify> @john-dev: Yes, it's working! thanks for hep
[12:10:21] <h0axify> *help
[12:10:23] <john-dev> np
[12:10:43] <h0axify> I'm javascript n00b :)
[12:11:48] <john-dev> LittleFoot, after the dom has been loaded or within the html head tag?
[12:12:13] <LittleFoot> what ever is easier
[12:12:34] <LittleFoot> i just want to load it so i can use it inside my widget
[12:12:34] <john-dev> LittleFoot, how are you embedding it at the moment?
[12:12:39] <LittleFoot> yes
[12:12:41] <john-dev> use .load
[12:12:52] <john-dev> i don't know your script..
[12:12:54] <nsfmc> is there some general rule of thumb about what elements you should use $.text() on and which you should use $.html() to get text content?
[12:13:15] <NoiseEee> nsfmc: really it depends on if you want html tags included?
[12:13:33] <NoiseEee> and if you're talking form elements, then its .val()
[12:13:41] <nsfmc> NoiseEee, i'm seeing an issue where using .text() on a script tag returns "" only in IE
[12:13:49] <LittleFoot> well i embed like <script type="text/javascript" src="http://domain.com/widget/widget.js"></script>
[12:14:06] <LittleFoot> then in that js file im loading jquery
[12:14:09] <NoiseEee> nsfmc: jsfiddle
[12:14:13] <LittleFoot> head.appendChild(script);
[12:14:14] <nsfmc> on it
[12:14:45] <LittleFoot> is that the best wat to do it
[12:15:02] <john-dev> LittleFoot, the best is is to load jquery before thath widget, but it should work..
[12:15:19] <DukeDrake> how can I define a var which will be a jqeury object later? var futurejqobj = object .... ?
[12:15:22] <LittleFoot> well i dont want to have ppl loading jquery
[12:16:13] <john-dev> LittleFoot, how do you load jquery from within your .js file?
[12:17:15] <LittleFoot> append script
[12:17:19] <LittleFoot> to the head section
[12:17:31] <john-dev> that won't work
[12:17:37] <john-dev> since .append is a jquery function
[12:17:38] <john-dev> Oo
[12:18:01] <LittleFoot> no im using standard js
[12:18:04] <LittleFoot> to apend
[12:18:20] <LittleFoot> its working for my css
[12:18:28] <john-dev> with document.write?
[12:18:33] <LittleFoot> yes
[12:18:41] <john-dev> hmh, i don't know if this will work
[12:18:43] <LittleFoot> head.appendChild(script);
[12:18:58] <LittleFoot> var head = document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0];
[12:19:57] <DukeDrake> anyone?
[12:20:11] <DukeDrake> var myjquerobject = jquery; ?
[12:20:26] <john-dev> LittleFoot, try do use a jquery function after appending that js file..
[12:20:37] <john-dev> i don't this will work..
[12:21:13] <LittleFoot> if i try to use it it only works if i use a timeout
[12:21:17] <LittleFoot> before calling it
[12:21:32] <john-dev> y, you odn't know how long a person needs to download that file
[12:21:45] <LittleFoot> yeah it sux
[12:21:49] <john-dev> and there is no callback of course..
[12:22:33] <john-dev> LittleFoot, you could try to import another file, executing jQuery commands..
[12:22:41] <john-dev> after the jquery append
[12:22:58] <LittleFoot> y would that work
[12:23:05] <john-dev> i dont know
[12:23:09] <cloke> is there a reason that $('some-elm').on doesn't work with drag, draginit, dragstart, etc?
[12:23:17] <john-dev> it's strange that it's working with jquery
[12:23:40] <john-dev> you could build a loop.. :P
[12:26:05] <skamikaze> someone knows how to tells jshint that it shouldn't care about "unexpected space"?
[12:31:42] <nsfmc> NoiseEee, http://jsfiddle.net/Pjjyy/6/
[12:32:28] <vis> I realise this is probably quite a basic question, but I'm trying to access some data via json which is data.results.0.id - I don't seem to be able to get at any data which has a number in it though
[12:32:30] <nsfmc> NoiseEee, in particular, a.text() = ""
[12:32:35] <vis> do I need to escape the 0?
[12:33:09] <jancel> hmm, does data.results[0].id work? @vis
[12:33:47] <vis> jancel, I'll check. Might take a second, I'm using an emac :)
[12:34:01] <nsfmc> NoiseEee, this seems like an issue with getText() that's been happening since 1.7.1
[12:34:10] <vis> jancel: Nope
[12:34:15] <LittleFoot> john-dev ok seems to work
[12:34:25] <LittleFoot> i jquery i removed the $ bind
[12:34:38] <LittleFoot> then i load jq with append
[12:34:46] <vis> but data.results[0].id does
[12:34:47] <vis> thanks!
[12:34:58] <LittleFoot> then i settime out to use jquery
[12:35:08] <jancel> vyou're welcome
[12:35:20] <LittleFoot> i can also do a recursive function to pick it up when its readyu
[12:35:34] <john-dev> LittleFoot, setTimeout won't work in any case
[12:35:42] <LittleFoot> its working now
[12:35:45] <LittleFoot> y now
[12:35:47] <LittleFoot> t
[12:35:57] <john-dev> vis thats what he said
[12:36:14] <Leka> hi, can anyone help me with a function to use a clicked elements ID, to load files - visual aspect of my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/MMZWH/
[12:37:16] <civilordergone> helloo
[12:37:21] <john-dev> Leka,  use .on instead of .live, its deprecated
[12:37:49] <john-dev> $(this).attr('id') is what you are looking for
[12:38:32] <civilordergone> http://jsfiddle.net/3qHSZ when i use that code on an iframe to hover above an image, it flickers in internet explorer
[12:38:56] <Leka> john-dev: okey, i'll keep that in mind (changed it)
[12:39:14] <john-dev> civilordergone, this is a jquery help channel
[12:39:22] <civilordergone> oh whoops
[12:39:28] <john-dev> Leka, be aware you need jquety > 1.7.1 then
[12:39:42] <Leka> john-dev: well, one of the versions have that approach (version 2) but how do i apply that to the "path" ?
[12:39:46] <Leka> john-dev: got it ;)
[12:39:48] <john-dev> civilordergone, bzw, is thath you?^^
[12:40:00] <john-dev> :-)
[12:40:11] <civilordergone> hmm?
[12:40:17] <john-dev> nice picture..
[12:40:22] <civilordergone> hahah ohh
[12:40:24] <civilordergone> noo
[12:40:36] <Trisox> i do this var something =  "'http://localhost/janvandekrent/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/bg21.jpg','http://localhost/janvandekrent/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/bg1.jpg'" i wan to pass the something in to [something] and the urls get encoded how do i fid this
[12:41:04] <Leka> john-dev: the .load("explanation/"$currentID".php) isn't working out so, how do i break the path and make i t add my variable to the string?
[12:41:18] <john-dev> "+var+"
[12:41:27] <nsfmc>  i'm seeing an issue where using .text() on a script tag returns "", but only in IE
[12:41:28] <Leka> oh
[12:41:50] <eddiemonge> Trisox: say wha?
[12:41:53] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to put an absolute url in there
[12:42:16] <john-dev> Leka you are missing a quote after .php
[12:42:20] <Trisox> i want to pass my var something in to an array
[12:42:39] <eddiemonge> nsfmc: $("script").text()?
[12:42:55] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/Pjjyy/6/
[12:43:04] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, but yes
[12:43:21] <eddiemonge> Trisox: you mean like array.push(something);
[12:43:34] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, seems like an issue with getText
[12:43:43] <neybar> how do I select all the inputs in a form that aren't disabled?  $('#form :input') gives me everthing.  I've tried a few different combinations of: $('#form :not:disabled'), but I can't quite get what I need.
[12:43:58] <Trisox> oke
[12:44:15] <eddiemonge> nsfmc: why would you do that? it seems like its trying to parse the text so use html since thats that it kind of is anyway
[12:44:31] <aaronmcadam> neybar: $('form').find('input').not(':disabled') try that
[12:44:44] <john-dev> neybar, if($â€¦attr('id')!="undefined" maybe
[12:44:47] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, i guess the real question is _why_ is .text() returning ""
[12:44:55] <john-dev> id = disabled
[12:45:02] <eddiemonge> ?text
[12:45:03] <bot-t> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[12:45:09] <aaronmcadam> you'd need to use that on $.fn.filter
[12:45:32] <Leka> john-dev: this is what i got right now http://jsfiddle.net/MMZWH/1/ and it doesn't work :( what quotation do you refer to?
[12:45:35] <LittleFoot> <john-dev> it worked
[12:45:43] <LittleFoot> setTimeout(function() {widget.load();
[12:45:45] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, am i missing something, the behavior is inconsistent between browsers
[12:45:46] <eddiemonge> nsfmc: put that script stuff in a cdata block
[12:45:51] <neybar> aaronmcadam: excellent!  thanks
[12:45:57] <LittleFoot> and before that
[12:45:58] <aaronmcadam> neybar did it work?
[12:45:58] <LittleFoot> 	if (typeof(jQuery) == 'function') {widget.draw();return;
[12:46:09] <neybar> aaronmcadam: yes
[12:46:11] <LittleFoot> see when jq loads it quits loaded
[12:46:12] <aaronmcadam> good stuff
[12:46:16] <LittleFoot> r and starts drawing
[12:46:47] <eddiemonge> Leka: get rid of the $ in the variable. JS doesnt use that
[12:47:02] <john-dev> Leka, where is .top?
[12:47:13] <aaronmcadam> $var is just a convention if it's a jQuery set
[12:47:46] <Leka> john-dev: http://jsfiddle.net/MMZWH/2/
[12:48:00] <Leka> eddiemonge: thanks, i slipped ;)
[12:48:42] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/Pjjyy/7/
[12:48:59] <eddiemonge> kenperkins: your variable names have to match. its case sensitive
[12:49:03] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, still exhibiting the same problem in ie, though
[12:49:12] <hi88is> hello all - trying to use JSFiddle
[12:49:27] <hi88is> plz take a quick look and help me understand how to correctly get my css working here?
[12:49:32] <hi88is> http://jsfiddle.net/LRECa/3/
[12:50:11] <eddiemonge> Leka: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/MMZWH/3/
[12:50:45] <eddiemonge> nsfmc: short answer: stop trying to use .text() on a script tag
[12:51:10] <hi88is> duh - i got it
[12:51:16] <hi88is> haha had stupid markup error
[12:51:16] <hi88is> haha
[12:51:16] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, hahhaahahahahahahaha
[12:51:18] <spencer_mize_> hi88is, don't say id="#sdf"
[12:51:24] <spencer_mize_> haha
[12:51:25] <hi88is> thx spenc
[12:51:26] <hi88is> :)
[12:51:26] <hi88is> lol
[12:51:34] <hi88is> need more coffee and a shower i guess
[12:51:34] <spencer_mize_> haha, np
[12:51:35] <hi88is> ;)
[12:51:42] <spencer_mize_> i feel ya
[12:51:44] <john-dev> Leka, currentId shouldnt be use, here is a working example http://jsfiddle.net/tQyLH/
[12:51:55] <john-dev> further you had currentID instead of currentId
[12:53:06] <Trisox> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/5j7BdYKW ...
[12:54:21] <mrassi> does QUnit always show the time is millisecond in the test run summary or do the units change based on value?
[12:54:24] <john-dev> Trisox, why don'T you just ust var imagelist = [1,2,3]?
[12:54:37] <john-dev> use*
[12:54:41] <Trisox> mmm
[12:54:55] <eddiemonge> john-dev: why cant currentId be used?
[12:55:05] <Trisox> the bgstrecher uses ['1','2','3']
[12:55:20] <john-dev> eddiemonge, don't know, it's not working using this var, maybe its a global thing or function
[12:55:44] <Trisox> john-dev: i also need to trim some..
[12:55:49] <Trisox> slice i mean
[12:56:00] <Leka> john-dev: awesome, it works great :D thanks!
[12:56:04] <Trisox> cause igenerate the srt with php
[12:56:07] <john-dev> Leka, yaw
[12:56:26] <Leka> eddiemonge: i didn't get the typeof the_currentID !== "undefined" to work though
[12:56:29] <john-dev> This "asd","asd" will probably add this string as one elemtn inside the array..
[12:56:39] <aaronmcadam> haha just found this, searching for a bash operator: http://www.bash.org.uk/
[12:56:42] <kenperkins> eddiemonge: thanks for letting me know my variable names have to change :)
[12:56:45] <john-dev> Leka, because you used currentId (with a lowercaed d)
[12:56:59] <john-dev> further currentId seems to be used by javascript
[12:57:32] <eddiemonge> Leka: did you case match the variable names? unless you have a php page named undefined, you need the way i showed you
[12:57:37] <Leka> john-dev: ah christ, i feel like such an idiot - sorry. but thanks for the help :))
[12:57:47] <john-dev> ;-)
[12:57:55] <eddiemonge> john-dev: its not
[12:58:16] <Leka> eddiemonge: nah, i had the cases wrong, *embarrassed*
[12:58:18] <john-dev> hm, true
[12:58:32] <eddiemonge> Trisox: what are you doing? where are you getting that string from?
[12:58:51] <john-dev> ah ok, its because 3333 had no id
[12:58:55] <Trisox> i generate it with php
[12:59:15] <eddiemonge> Leka: my way first checked that the thing you were clicking had an id and then only called the .load() if it did
[12:59:23] <eddiemonge> Trisox: how? where?
[13:00:40] <Leka> eddiemonge: yep, after i had the case-sensitivity actually match, it worked - and it was a great addition to the script <3 ty
[13:01:16] <elfrancesco_> hello
[13:01:43] <Trisox> uhh the url's
[13:01:48] <Trisox> i generate that
[13:01:54] <Trisox> with an while loop
[13:02:09] <LittleFoot> <john-dev> wat u think
[13:02:16] <eddiemonge> Trisox: but where. how is javascript getting that string?
[13:02:37] <john-dev> LittleFoot, ?
[13:02:41] <LittleFoot> its working
[13:02:45] <LittleFoot> so far
[13:02:45] <Trisox> i generate the string 'url','url' in there with php
[13:02:51] <john-dev> using setTimeout?
[13:02:54] <LittleFoot> if (typeof(jQuery) == 'function') {
[13:02:54] <LittleFoot> 			widget.draw();
[13:02:54] <LittleFoot> 			return;
[13:02:54] <LittleFoot> 		}
[13:03:02] <LittleFoot> setTimeout(function() {
[13:03:02] <LittleFoot> 			widget.load();	
[13:03:02] <LittleFoot> 		}, 100);
[13:03:03] <john-dev> hm ok
[13:03:05] <LittleFoot> see
[13:03:08] <john-dev> not good
[13:03:09] <LittleFoot> it keeps trying
[13:03:15] <LittleFoot> till its loaded
[13:03:28] <LittleFoot> wats bad about that
[13:03:39] <john-dev> you foce someone to include jquery, even if it is already loaded..
[13:03:43] <john-dev> i wouldn't work like that..
[13:03:47] <eddiemonge> Trisox: you are creating your JS file with PHP?
[13:04:17] <Trisox> just the var srt
[13:04:53] <aaronmcadam> yucky :)
[13:04:54] <elfrancesco_> i am trying to use some javascript lib which accept some json parameter like in this example : var point = myList.addItem([{ Attachments: "0", CoordinateX: varX, CoordinateY: varY}]);    I am wondering if there is a way for me to call it like this : var point = myList.addItem([{ Attachments: "0", VariableParameter1: varX, VariableParameter1: varY}]);
[13:04:55] <eddiemonge> so that js is on your php page and is generated in the same place?
[13:04:56] <LittleFoot> ok well
[13:05:02] <LittleFoot> i just moved the apend script
[13:05:12] <LittleFoot> so if they have jq already it doesnt load it
[13:05:14] <LittleFoot> over
[13:05:17] <LittleFoot> better?
[13:05:18] <john-dev> good
[13:05:26] <LittleFoot> can i do it this way?
[13:05:35] <aaronmcadam> why elfrancesco
[13:06:20] <LittleFoot> most of the time i do weird stuff
[13:06:23] <LittleFoot> hoping it works
[13:06:30] <LittleFoot> do u think this is good to go
[13:06:49] <john-dev> sure
[13:06:55] <Trisox> eddiemonge: its var srt = "'1','2','3'"; var imagelist = JSON.parse('[' + srt(/'/g, '"') + ']');
[13:07:00] <Trisox> :) thnx for the help
[13:07:25] <elfrancesco_> john-dev: addItem add Items to a sharepoint list where the field name can vary from list to other list. I need a way to generically call it by storing field name in variables
[13:07:42] <aaronmcadam> Trisox: you do know about the json_encode php func right
[13:08:21] <LittleFoot> now the real test
[13:08:23] <LittleFoot> ajax
[13:08:30] <LittleFoot> help me jesus
[13:08:49] <john-dev> elfrancesco_ i dont get it
[13:09:33] <Trisox> i know aaronmcadam but this works fine
[13:09:46] <aaronmcadam> uh ok...
[13:10:41] <elfrancesco_> well i am working with a list called listA. which have 3 fields : fieldA1, fieldA2 and field A3. Next time i will use some listB which will have fields : anotherfieldB1, anotherfieldB2, anotherfieldB3. I want to call mylist.addItem so that i can store in some variables varField1Name, varField2NAme etc
[13:10:55] <aaronmcadam> sure does, using a regex to parse json that can be passed over in the right data structure in the first place
[13:11:17] <Chopps> hey guys, does anyone know if there is a jquery plugin to do fancy dialog windows or something similar?
[13:11:37] <jancel> chopps try jqueryui
[13:11:48] <jancel> $.dialog
[13:11:50] <eddiemonge> nsfmc: like i said, .text() on a script is unsupported. had to double check
[13:11:56] <elfrancesco_> chopps jquery.ui and dialog function
[13:12:17] <Chopps> ah thanks, will take a look :D
[13:12:29] <eddiemonge> Trisox: "works fine" is subjective, especially when you come in complaining something doesnt work later because of this
[13:12:43] <eddiemonge> Trisox: we are trying to help you with best practices as well as getting it to work
[13:13:07] <elfrancesco_> aaronmcadam: would you have some more explainations about the regexp thing and json ? in fact in don't know much about json to not tell i know almost anything about
[13:13:32] <jancel> chopps, other libs I like include facebox(http://defunkt.io/facebox/) and lightbox(http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/)
[13:14:12] <Trisox> eddiemonge: ill try to take a look
[13:14:24] <Trisox> kinda have to have this working tomorrow..
[13:14:27] <Trisox> beh
[13:14:34] <Chopps> thanks for the suggestions jancel :D
[13:15:14] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: emmm basically, I meant you if u encode your json properly *before* you send it to the client, and then JSON.parse it, it's much easier to actually read and use the code
[13:15:30] <LittleFoot> how come ajax is not working when embeded
[13:15:43] <LittleFoot> can it not access another server
[13:15:57] <jancel> LittleFoot what do you mean embedded? Have you tried jsonp?
[13:16:04] <elfrancesco_> ok
[13:16:09] <Trisox> eddiemonge: the json_encode php function doesnt count here
[13:16:23] <LittleFoot> no i am making embedable js widget
[13:16:31] <LittleFoot> so far i got jquery to load in there
[13:16:35] <Trisox> the php output is not the problem
[13:16:43] <aaronmcadam> if you encode your array, which it is, instead of trying to bastardise it in ur js, it's easier to work with
[13:16:46] <LittleFoot> but now ajax wont go
[13:16:56] <jancel> LittleFoot there are cross site restrictions, it requires jsonp callbacks, and the server must be able to respond to jsonp
[13:17:06] <elfrancesco_> thanks aaronmcadam  in fact i didn't knew i could use something like { "string" : myvaluevar } i thought it was only { string : myvaluevar } (without quote) anyways it works now thanks again
[13:17:17] <eddiemonge> Trisox: it is when you could just output the object/array directly
[13:17:22] <LittleFoot> how do i set that up
[13:17:23] <NoiseEee> Trisox: split the string on ',', voila, array
[13:17:58] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: you're getting mixed up between JSON ( { "key" : "value" } and an Object Literal ( { key : value } ). They're 2 different things
[13:18:13] <jancel> LittleFoot use jsonp instead of json I believe, the web server must respond using a wrapper, that takes the function name.
[13:18:54] <elfrancesco_> ok
[13:19:49] <jancel> LittleFoot I once did an article for this, see if this explains it OK. http://www.ajaxprojects.com/ajax/tutorialdetails.php?itemid=555 It's a .net MVC solution
[13:20:06] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco: JSON is a string which must be parsed. An Object Literal is an actual object.
[13:20:53] <aaronmcadam> although it may confuse you, an obj literal can have quoted keys and values
[13:21:38] <aaronmcadam> whilst JSON *must* have quoted keys and quoted values if the values are strings
[13:22:05] <elfrancesco_> ok
[13:22:07] <Eviltwin> The quoted keys always work in literals, the unquoted ones don't always work.
[13:22:16] <elfrancesco_> clearer now thanks to you
[13:22:35] <Eviltwin> And I think there are actually minor differences in what the browsers do and don't accept
[13:22:48] <Eviltwin> The other thing is that object[0] === object["0"]
[13:22:58] <Eviltwin> All keys are strings
[13:23:08] <Eviltwin> If the key you use isn't a string, it gets converted to a string then used
[13:24:03] <aaronmcadam> yeah keywords are an obvious one
[13:24:32] <Eviltwin> Unless I'm really sure the key won't be a problem, I quote it
[13:24:45] <aaronmcadam> like if u try an unquoted z-index that'll error
[13:24:46] <DofLeFou> Any known issues with AJAX POST on Safari version 5.1.2 ?
[13:24:54] <elfrancesco_> aaronmcadam: what if i replace quotted key name by a string var containing the key name in my literal object  ?
[13:25:14] <aaronmcadam> then you can use the [] pattern
[13:25:26] <aaronmcadam> obj[myVarKey] = value
[13:25:45] <DofLeFou> I only see my issue on Safari version 5.1.2  â€¦ it works on 5.0.2
[13:25:48] <Eviltwin> Obviously if you have a colon in the or quote in the key, you need to quote it
[13:25:50] <Eviltwin> ?object
[13:25:51] <bot-t> object.foo === object["foo"]
[13:25:58] <aaronmcadam> thanks for that hah
[13:26:03] <elfrancesco_> in fact i don't really have
[13:26:13] <elfrancesco_> oups sorry forget the last line
[13:26:14] <spencer_mize_> what's the issue specifically doflefou?
[13:27:00] <DofLeFou> spencer_mize_: â€¦ I m doing a simple AJAX POST
[13:27:13] <DofLeFou> it works on all Browsers
[13:27:28] <DofLeFou> even work on safari 5.0.2
[13:28:00] <DofLeFou> But from a Safari browser running 5.1.2 â€¦ I m getting a 500 error
[13:28:27] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[13:28:34] <aaronmcadam> what's ur server side?
[13:28:40] <aaronmcadam> are you not logging errors server side?
[13:28:44] <john-dev> DofLeFou, show us your code using jsfiddle
[13:29:20] <arkascha> Question: I have several $.when().then() sequences...
[13:29:34] <Eviltwin> K
[13:29:39] <arkascha> In one of them I need to specify a dynamic function as one of the when-arguments.
[13:29:44] <arkascha> but that wont work.
[13:29:49] <Eviltwin> You use .apply
[13:29:55] <arkascha> how can I get that dynamic funciton to execute immediately ?
[13:30:03] <Eviltwin> $.when.apply($, mylistofdeferreds).then(...)
[13:30:14] <Eviltwin> Wait, what?
[13:31:15] <DofLeFou> guys here is a fiddle â€¦.  http://jsfiddle.net/VLJ3F
[13:31:25] <arkascha> Eviltwin: is there any documentation for that apply() ? Cant find it...
[13:31:33] <aaronmcadam> wha??
[13:31:37] <aaronmcadam> it's js
[13:31:39] <aaronmcadam> ?mdc apply
[13:31:40] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, apply - MDN - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[13:31:58] <Eviltwin> arkascha: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function.arguments
[13:32:51] <arkascha> ok, thanks, I will take a lok at that.
[13:32:55] <DofLeFou> this piece of code http://jsfiddle.net/VLJ3F work on 5.0.2 â€¦ and not on 5.1.2
[13:34:00] <aaronmcadam> wowwww
[13:34:04] <aaronmcadam> man
[13:34:18] <aaronmcadam> calling a function like that within an if predicate
[13:34:20] <aaronmcadam> wowee
[13:34:33] <aaronmcadam> bad bad form
[13:34:51] <aaronmcadam> DofLeFou: you know there's a submitHandler option of jquery validate
[13:35:00] <aaronmcadam> that will call if form is valid right
[13:36:00] <elfrancesco_> aaronmcadam: i have made my object with many line of myObject[myfieldvarxxx]= somedata. I want to convert to string the myObject so i can pass it to my function wich want as a parameter a Json string. Does i need to include json2.js and call stringify or is there something else please ?
[13:36:39] <aaronmcadam> are you sure it needs to be json?
[13:37:09] <aaronmcadam> you must mean it wants an obj literal
[13:37:11] <aaronmcadam> which u already have
[13:37:27] <ch3mical> Can someone help me devise an animation that moves an object from bottom-right to top-left in an arch? I can probably do it with a series of animates, but I'm thinking there's gotta be a better wait, using the step function of the animate properties
[13:37:34] <ch3mical> And some maths
[13:37:37] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: make a jsfiddle
[13:37:41] <hi88is> hey all- can someone take a look at this pastebin - i'm wondering what the use of (jQuery) is in the function
[13:37:48] <hi88is> i've never seen jQuery written like this
[13:37:49] <hi88is> http://pastebin.com/Wsy5N6A2
[13:37:59] <aaronmcadam> most likely an IIFE
[13:38:03] <arkascha> Sorry, still dont get it, maybe someone can take a look at this: http://paste.opensuse.org/87839459
[13:38:15] <arkascha> How do I have to change the dynamic function) in the middle ?
[13:38:25] <aaronmcadam> yeah hi88is look up what an IIFE
[13:38:28] <aaronmcadam> is
[13:38:33] <hi88is> thx
[13:38:45] <aaronmcadam> ?g ben alman IIFE
[13:38:46] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) - http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[13:38:49] <aaronmcadam> there ye are
[13:39:03] <aaronmcadam> passes in jQuery as the $ var
[13:39:18] <aaronmcadam> to stop possible collision, creating a closure
[13:39:44] <ch3mical> jQuery(function($) { your codes });
[13:39:47] <aaronmcadam> hi88is: that's how jQuery plugins attach themselves
[13:39:53] <aaronmcadam> no
[13:40:03] <aaronmcadam> that's not the same thing
[13:40:20] <aaronmcadam> that's just equiv of doc.ready yeah but it's not an IIFE
[13:40:35] <ch3mical> I wasn't giving an example of IIFE
[13:40:40] <aaronmcadam> a closure :)
[13:40:50] <hi88is> so an IIFE is used to pull in a jQuery plugin when the doc is loaded?
[13:41:06] <aaronmcadam> well, when jquery is
[13:41:38] <aaronmcadam> because the plugin pattern is : $.fn.myPlugin = func...
[13:41:45] <aaronmcadam> so $ must already be assigned for it to work
[13:42:00] <ch3mical> Oh nevermind my question, I think I can get what I need by setting queue:false in the animate
[13:42:24] <hi88is> ah
[13:42:30] <aaronmcadam> or more accurately, jQuery must be defined
[13:42:39] <hi88is> so an IIFE is used to pull in a jQuery plugin when jQuery is loaded?
[13:42:48] <hi88is> that the correct way of saying it?
[13:42:57] <aaronmcadam> an IIFE is used to automatically run any function
[13:43:00] <aaronmcadam> but yes
[13:43:11] <ch3mical> IIFE is not specific to jQuery
[13:43:15] <aaronmcadam> but it knows nothing about the "when jq is loaded"
[13:43:18] <arkascha> Eviltwin: sorry, still got a problem with apply(). Can you give me a hint on this : http://paste.opensuse.org/87839459
[13:43:22] <hi88is> k
[13:43:29] <Eviltwin> arkascha: Sorry, gotta run
[13:43:36] <aaronmcadam> that's why u must include plugins *after* jquery hi88is
[13:43:52] <aaronmcadam> jQuery itself uses an IIFE to attach itself
[13:44:05] <aaronmcadam> well all libs do
[13:44:09] <arkascha> sure.
[13:44:30] <aaronmcadam> i like underscore's way of adding a .call(this) at the end too
[13:44:38] <aaronmcadam> just to be doubly completely sure
[13:44:41] <aaronmcadam> of context
[13:44:51] <FunnyLookinHat> I'm getting a "Failed to load resource" error - but the URL seems to be correct - any idea why ?  This is my stack trace: http://pastebin.com/dAy4Dza0
[13:44:58] <Eviltwin> But what you want is probably $.when.apply($, [].concat([...], $.map(list, function(i) { return listAdd(i, this) }), [...])).then(...)
[13:45:12] <Eviltwin> Where the ...s are filled in with exacty what you had there
[13:45:21] <Eviltwin> Sorry, I had to use some shortcuts but I think all of the ideas are there
[13:45:47] <aaronmcadam> ah ajpiano had a good solution for this
[13:46:17] <hi88is> thanks for the info aaron
[13:46:20] <hi88is> gonna fly
[13:46:21] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[13:46:23] <hi88is> ttyl :)
[13:46:23] <aaronmcadam> cya
[13:46:36] <arkascha> Eviltwin: ahem, well, I will think about that reply :-) Thanks !
[13:46:42] <elfrancesco_> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/sNN9M/
[13:46:59] <aaronmcadam> wow
[13:47:08] <aaronmcadam> Too many parameters Error
[13:47:09] <aaronmcadam> haha
[13:48:06] <aaronmcadam> ok I see
[13:48:37] <sphinxxx> is there any way to read response headers in jquery?
[13:49:06] <elfrancesco__> hi again ....
[13:51:07] <jancel> sphinxxx I think you'd have to dump them using your web servermost likely. I'd like to hear if you find otherwise.
[13:51:26] <sphinxxx> jancel:  using curl?
[13:52:00] <aaronmcadam> fuckin fiddle
[13:53:02] <AaronCampbell> Is there a way to get the value that a textarea (or input[text] ) field started with, not just what it currently contains?
[13:53:09] <ngharo> sphinxxx: you can view headers in the jqXHR object
[13:53:23] <ngharo> of an ajax request*
[13:53:46] <sphinxxx> ngharo: ya you're right, except this is for cross-domain resources so i guess ill have to use curl
[13:54:06] <kanzie> if I save the ajax()-object, is it enougg just setting it to null later to clear the memory or should I delete all the properties of ajax() to clear the response data etc. from leaking into the memory?
[13:54:45] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: nearly got it
[13:55:09] <jancel> sphinxxx I guess. I usually x-domain through my server, unless I need it to be on client. Even if it is x-domain, shouldn't you get the same headers
[13:55:43] <LittleFoot> jancel
[13:56:05] <LittleFoot> so the only thing i can get is json ?
[13:56:44] <LittleFoot> dr nics acrticle tels me i can get json just by apending another script from my site
[13:57:25] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: look at this http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/sNN9M/12/
[13:57:57] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: look at this http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/sNN9M/13
[13:58:37] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: use the `data` variable in addItem now
[13:58:47] <elfrancesco__> okay i had to store it into an array after right ?
[13:58:53] <aaronmcadam> aye
[13:59:20] <aaronmcadam> that's the right structure now
[13:59:24] <jancel> well, you'll have to use jsonp to get the data, I guess you can use that tactic for any type of information, read the docs on jsonp though to get a better understanding.
[13:59:44] <jancel> LittleFoot
[14:00:02] <elfrancesco__> ok thanks and the push function is part of javascript standard functions ?
[14:00:24] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/nc28h/
[14:00:40] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[14:00:42] <LittleFoot> what i want to do is load a html temple
[14:00:46] <LittleFoot> template
[14:00:54] <aaronmcadam> actually might have one last tweak
[14:01:01] <tripodman> can someone take a look at this for me, my event firing isn't going how i assumed it would http://jsfiddle.net/7Vfec/
[14:01:02] <LittleFoot> which is what i do w ajax
[14:01:03] <elfrancesco__> ok thanks for your patience
[14:01:30] <tripodman> when i click on the input i shouldnt get an alert
[14:02:14] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/nc28h/
[14:02:15] <aaronmcadam> there
[14:02:18] <aaronmcadam> no need for push
[14:02:32] <aaronmcadam> open your console and u should see the structure
[14:03:51] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: so yeah, as I guessed, you're not using JSON at all, these are object literals
[14:04:33] <ngharo> https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2HlDLFOM02k/Tz0wobWRs4I/AAAAAAAAALA/7X2UEUNVQ9w/s809/html5.jpg
[14:05:09] <elfrancesco__> aaronmcadam: in fact i am getting tmpData: [Object { CarteX="177", CarteY="160", CIS="mans", more...}] and i should be getting tmpData: [ { CarteX="177", CarteY="160", CIS="mans", more...}]   <=== without the "Object" string
[14:05:25] <Phoenixz> I need a div to "flash" color between gray and red, continuously, until that div is clicked.. I know how to use $(div).animate('red', 'slow'); to make it go from gray to red, I know to use $(div).animate('red', 'slow', $(div).animate('gray', 'slow')); to make it go grey, red, gray, but how can I have it animate continously gray red gray red gray red etc.. until I stop the animation?
[14:05:30] <aaronmcadam> haha
[14:05:38] <aaronmcadam> elfrancesco_: that's just ur console silly
[14:05:52] <aaronmcadam> try it on ur actual code
[14:06:07] <aaronmcadam> it's telling you it's an array with one Object in it
[14:08:12] <elfrancesco__> ok aaronmcadam for now it is still now working... btw the function i am calling is : http://www.sharejpoint.com/docs/API/jP.Lists.List.addItem().aspx if you want to have a look anyway i will try to find the solution i guess you did almost all the job for me i should manage to find the solution in maybe less than 2 hours from now.... you saved me days ;) thank again
[14:08:26] <kanzie> if I save the ajax()-object, is it enough just setting it to null later to clear the memory or should I delete all the properties of ajax() to clear the response data etc. from leaking into the memory?
[14:08:33] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[14:08:39] <elfrancesco__> btw.... i think i really hate sharepoing...
[14:08:40] <aaronmcadam> my hourly rate is $xxx
[14:08:41] <elfrancesco__> t
[14:09:01] <aaronmcadam> fuck asp full stop :P
[14:09:58] <aaronmcadam> anyway you'd done most of it yourself elfrancesco_
[14:14:21] <LittleFoot> anyone doing cross site scripting?
[14:14:25] <LittleFoot> anyoneeeeeeeeeeeeee
[14:15:21] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[14:15:27] <aaronmcadam> exessesss
[14:16:42] <donCams> why are you doing XSS?
[14:18:14] <LittleFoot> yes
[14:18:19] <LittleFoot> kind of
[14:18:31] <LittleFoot> i just loaded jquery into it
[14:18:39] <LittleFoot> but now i realize u cant do ajax
[14:18:41] <LittleFoot> gah
[14:19:06] <ngharo> ch3ck 0ut my l33t h4x
[14:19:33] <LittleFoot> i thot i was leet but i gues not
[14:20:38] <donCams> jsonp ajax LittleFoot?
[14:20:52] <LittleFoot> im looking at it now
[14:21:15] <LittleFoot> but even using jsonp its giving me invalid label
[14:22:45] <kellyanne> Whats wrong with working at home? Are you threathened? my sister-inlaw makes $46 every hour on the computer. She has been out of work for 7 months but last month her pay was $5203 just working on the computer for a few hours. Read more on this google link..  http://tinyurl.com/7ftokq3
[14:24:37] <LittleFoot> how come im getting invalid lavel
[14:24:39] <LittleFoot> label
[14:25:08] <LittleFoot> print '{"'.$_GET['v'].'": "Singular sensation","two": "Beady little eyes","three": "Little birds pitch by my doorstep"}';
[14:25:20] <ixti> hi all!
[14:25:51] <ixti> what is better approach for templates hidden divs or scripts?
[14:26:30] <ixti> e,g, <div id="my-tpl" class="template">...</div> or <script id="my-tpl" type="text/template">...</script> ?
[14:28:17] <jancel> LittleFoot check what $_GET['v'] is, make sure it doesn't have special characters in it.
[14:28:27] <LittleFoot> it took it out
[14:28:31] <LittleFoot> but still
[14:28:43] <LittleFoot> <?php print '({"three": "Little birds pitch by my doorstep"})'; ?>
[14:28:51] <LittleFoot> this is the page im trying to request
[14:29:02] <aaronmcadam> ixti: I find script tags work better
[14:29:16] <LittleFoot> $.getJSON('http://ip/widget/api/view.php?callback=?', function(data) {
[14:29:19] <LittleFoot> see
[14:29:24] <aaronmcadam> ixti: because scripts with a different type won't get parsed
[14:29:27] <jancel> LittleFoot why the parens
[14:29:51] <LittleFoot> w out them i get error
[14:29:58] <LittleFoot> w them i get nothing
[14:30:00] <LittleFoot> gah
[14:30:02] <ixti> aaronmcadam: hm. interesting point
[14:30:09] <aaronmcadam> LittleFoot: json_encode
[14:30:35] <LittleFoot> but its already in json format
[14:30:41] <ixti> aaronmcadam: guess you're right. it will have some performance issues on one hand.
[14:30:47] <aaronmcadam> haha not in ur php it's not LittleFoot
[14:30:54] <aaronmcadam> no it won't
[14:30:55] <eddiemonge> LittleFoot: are you trying to do jsonp?
[14:31:00] <LittleFoot> yes
[14:31:08] <eddiemonge> whats the question?
[14:31:09] <ixti> aaronmcadam: but on another - i don't think it will be at lest notable
[14:31:16] <LittleFoot> y would i need to encode print '{"three": "Little birds pitch by my doorstep"}'
[14:31:20] <LittleFoot> its already in json
[14:31:47] <aaronmcadam> ixti: you're gonna have to compile the template, that's the greatest overhead no matter what. it's negligible anyway
[14:31:54] <aaronmcadam> no it's not
[14:32:01] <aaronmcadam> that is not json
[14:32:03] <jancel> LittleFoot, you must take the method name as a param, and respond as such. print methodName.'('.json.')';
[14:32:03] <aaronmcadam> lol
[14:32:39] <aaronmcadam> json_encode( three => "little birds"); will return a properly encoded string
[14:32:47] <aaronmcadam> don't concat json yourself...
[14:33:30] <ixti> json_encode(array("three" => "little birds"));
[14:33:38] <ixti> to be more correct :))
[14:33:43] <ixti> in PHP
[14:33:44] <jancel> aaronmcadam: agreed entirely!
[14:33:46] <aaronmcadam> yeh not used php in 2 years
[14:33:50] <aaronmcadam> thankfully
[14:34:16] <aaronmcadam> jancel you won't believe how many people build json by hand
[14:34:29] <DofLeFou> Sorry guys
[14:34:56] <DofLeFou> http://jsfiddle.net/VLJ3F â€¦ that AJAX POST works on 5.0.2
[14:34:57] <eddiemonge> LittleFoot: if you are doing jsonp, like aaronmcadam said, you need to return whatever is passed as callback: echo $_GET['callback'].'('.json_encode($your_array).');';
[14:35:01] <btreecat> if I have an element with id="user.user_id", and it is a dropdown box, how would I clear the selection back to default?
[14:35:07] <DofLeFou> and not on 5.1.2
[14:35:25] <DofLeFou> Any Know issue with AJAX POST on Safari
[14:35:26] <jancel> aaronmcadam: we need to marshal those people!
[14:35:29] <aaronmcadam> DofLeFou: did u use the submitHandler like i said
[14:35:43] <DofLeFou> sorry i go disconnected
[14:35:45] <DofLeFou> got
[14:35:50] <eddiemonge> DofLeFou: no.
[14:35:57] <DofLeFou> submitHandler?
[14:36:09] <eddiemonge> DofLeFou: hit JSLint on that fiddle
[14:36:22] <aaronmcadam> DofLeFou: ok, look up the docs for jquery validate
[14:36:38] <aaronmcadam> don't run a validate or any other 10 line function inside an if statement predicate
[14:37:47] <DofLeFou> eddiemonge: please explain â€¦ I m not following
[14:38:37] <DofLeFou> aaronmcadam: do you think it is a validate limitation?
[14:38:55] <aaronmcadam> no
[14:39:00] <DofLeFou> It does not make sense to me â€¦ that it works on previous versions of FIrefox
[14:39:00] <aaronmcadam> i think it's your bad code
[14:39:08] <aaronmcadam> don't do it that way
[14:39:12] <DofLeFou> for previous version of SAFARI
[14:39:12] <aaronmcadam> use the API validate gives you
[14:39:36] <aaronmcadam> do not put ur validate call in an if statement and then run an ajax request
[14:39:57] <aaronmcadam> use the submitHandler option of jq.validate
[14:40:48] <rangzen> hello everyone!
[14:40:55] <DofLeFou> aaronmcadam: I get what you meant now
[14:41:02] <DofLeFou> let me go do some reading about it
[14:41:06] <aaronmcadam> good
[14:41:16] <DofLeFou> This my first AJAX project
[14:41:22] <eddiemonge> DofLeFou: you need to lint your code. its not valid. press the JSLint button in jsfiddle.net to check it
[14:42:02] <ixti> aaronmcadam: thanks for your thoughts
[14:42:11] <rangzen> I found my exact question already asked in 2008 :Â http://www.mail-archive.com/jquery-en@googlegroups.com/msg21966.html but no answer. Someone had a hint? Thanks
[14:42:17] <DofLeFou> i don't see the button â€¦ do u have to be logged in
[14:42:21] <aaronmcadam> oh no prob ixti
[14:42:22] <ixti> aaronmcadam: guess i'm gonna switch to using script tags
[14:42:29] <aaronmcadam> yes please do
[14:42:39] <ixti> :))
[14:42:41] <aaronmcadam> and write a template loader
[14:43:03] <ixti> aaronmcadam: i have it already :))
[14:43:18] <aaronmcadam> cool
[14:43:19] <Carlitta87> hey guys....my page is running an error and wont display in IE very well....im wondering if its jus IE being IE....or did i mess up?
[14:43:27] <aaronmcadam> wow
[14:43:38] <DofLeFou> eddiemonge: pretty interesting this jsLint
[14:43:38] <aaronmcadam> ?broken
[14:43:39] <bot-t> select isn't broken: It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the application. -- http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/tips
[14:43:46] <eddiemonge> always love seeing code like this ""+filename+""
[14:43:47] <DofLeFou> I m seeing a lots of errors
[14:44:02] <eddiemonge> rangzen: you need to call .tabs() in the load() callback
[14:44:22] <eddiemonge> Carlitta87: if you have an error your should fix it
[14:44:44] <eddiemonge> DofLeFou: theres the start of your issue
[14:44:53] <aaronmcadam> ah christ
[14:45:05] <aaronmcadam> i always use array.join() for concats
[14:45:16] <rangzen> eddiemonge: I do that but the class are inserted only in the already existing div and ul, The inserted li and div content are not affected
[14:45:18] <aaronmcadam> or maybe the concat func i spose
[14:46:24] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ rangzen
[14:46:24] <bot-t> rangzen, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:46:29] <kanzie> Im testing ajax() right now and loading a bunch of XML, then I do nothing else. Yet my memory keeps growing for the process and never gets released. Is there a memory-leak in $ajax()
[14:46:45] <aaronmcadam> parsing XML is slooow
[14:46:53] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: sorry, thats actually  .something(""+filename+"")
[14:46:59] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[14:47:01] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[14:47:02] <rangzen> eddiemonge: bot-t: yeah I am uploading it at github
[14:47:05] <eddiemonge> nice emty string concats
[14:47:10] <aaronmcadam> yeeea :D
[14:47:11] <eddiemonge> bot-t: who are you?
[14:47:12] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Ask again later.
[14:47:17] <aaronmcadam> haha
[14:47:26] <aaronmcadam> talking to a bot, man
[14:47:36] <Carlitta87> eddiemonge wudnt be in here if i knoew where the problem was
[14:47:46] <DerekPioneer> i have an on click event that fires multiple times when clicked once
[14:47:47] <DerekPioneer> http://pastebin.com/NYS7Sj78
[14:47:49] <coldhead> hej aaronmcadam
[14:47:54] <aaronmcadam> oh noooo
[14:47:58] <aaronmcadam> it's sexy boy
[14:49:23] <eddiemonge> Carlitta87: well you are going to have to give more information then
[14:49:49] <eddiemonge> DerekPioneer: what is that code in?
[14:49:55] <DerekPioneer> domready
[14:50:02] <btreecat> How do you reset the selection of a select box with jquery?
[14:50:26] <Carlitta87> in IE tester i got an error that stated Line: 13 Error: 'jQuery' is undefined but it points to google font.... can i get to keep it?
[14:50:35] <Carlitta87> eddiemonge
[14:50:57] <eddiemonge> DerekPioneer: why are you doing stopPropagation on a dom ready event?
[14:51:10] <DerekPioneer> because that was what stackoverflow told me to do with a similar error
[14:51:15] <DerekPioneer> the problem persisted before that
[14:51:22] <eddiemonge> Carlitta87: you have to include jquery
[14:51:31] <coldhead> true dat
[14:51:34] <aaronmcadam> btreecat: $('select').val('')
[14:51:38] <aaronmcadam> sup coldhead xx
[14:51:54] <eddiemonge> DerekPioneer: that cant but your whole code because that isnt going to fire multi times. dont put that first stopprop
[14:52:05] <eddiemonge> ?coldhead
[14:52:05] <bot-t> coldhead: a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[14:52:11] <Carlitta87> Line: 1 Error: 'jQuery' is undefined eddiemonge ....i guess that related to my first jquery which a superfish application

[14:52:21] <eddiemonge> Carlitta87: you have to include jquery

[14:52:37] <aaronmcadam> ah some, forgotten a lot of it
[14:52:59] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: does that reset all select boxes?
[14:52:59] <coldhead> i've been listening to irish radio but uh... it's not something you can just absorb apparently
[14:53:08] <coldhead> sounds pretty though
[14:53:09] <aaronmcadam> ?tias @ btreecat

[14:53:32] <coldhead> possibly
[14:53:44] <coldhead> still, what an age we live in
[14:53:46] <aaronmcadam> well I know u are
[14:53:47] <DerekPioneer> aaronmcadam: do you want to see my whole code then?
[14:53:51] <aaronmcadam> listenin to fuckin irish radio
[14:53:55] <DerekPioneer> because it's firing more than once
[14:54:02] <DerekPioneer> and there's no other click event attached to this id
[14:54:03] <aaronmcadam> excuse meee?
[14:54:13] <DerekPioneer> sorry eddiemonge
[14:54:16] <aaronmcadam> :D
[14:55:17] <kanzie> since $.ajax() seems to be leaking way to much memory to be usable for me, what other libraries do you recommend for ajax-communication?
[14:55:18] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: did not clear any boxes
[14:55:28] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: selections**
[14:55:35] <eddiemonge> kanzie: i dont think its $.ajax()
[14:55:39] <eddiemonge> i think its your code
[14:55:51] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ DerekPioneer
[14:55:52] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. Pastebin.com sucks
[14:56:10] <DerekPioneer> ugh
[14:56:44] <kanzie> eddiemonge: hehe, wellâ€¦ my code doesn't do much more than calling ajax() and I see memory being eaten in task manager. Sure it could be other reasons but switching to another library would keep the problem then and that would rule $.ajax() out
[14:57:07] <aaronmcadam> btreecat: selections? jsfiddle
[14:57:42] <aaronmcadam> kanzie what are u doing in ur ajax callback that's killing ur memory
[14:58:17] <AaronCampbell> Is there a way to get the value that a textarea (or input[text] ) field started with, not just what it currently contains?
[14:58:42] <eddiemonge> btreecat: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/HWf5u/
[14:59:01] <DerekPioneer> how is it possible that $('.save_ugc').on('click'    would activate twice
[14:59:02] <Emn1ty> aaroncampbell: on page load, save the contents to a variable
[14:59:03] <DerekPioneer> when clicked once
[14:59:07] <eddiemonge> kanzie: paste your code see ? pe
[14:59:07] <bot-t> kanzie, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. Pastebin.com sucks
[14:59:08] <DerekPioneer> the first time i click it it works fine
[14:59:13] <DerekPioneer> the second time it activates twice
[14:59:21] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: setting a flag to 0, extending an object with the result and then nothing more.
[14:59:52] <AaronCampbell> Emn1ty: Ok, so there's no way to access the actual HTML, just the DOM.  Thanks
[14:59:59] <eddiemonge> AaronCampbell: you will probably need to save it first see ? data
[15:00:00] <bot-t> AaronCampbell, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:00:04] <btreecat> eddiemonge: tried that... did not work
[15:00:26] <eddiemonge> DerekPioneer: because you are binding it more than once
[15:00:35] <DerekPioneer> where else am i binding it
[15:00:51] <knubbze_> hi; how can I give the jquery ui autocomplete a z-index?
[15:00:57] <btreecat> aaronmcadam:
[15:01:00] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/dJJZp/
[15:01:21] <knubbze_> i just need it for one particular autocomplete because it is being partly overlayed by an image
[15:01:46] <DerekPioneer> eddiemonge: $('.save_ugc').unbind('click').on("click"    works
[15:02:02] <eddiemonge> DerekPioneer: no idea since you arent showing all your code
[15:02:07] <aaronmcadam> what's this now?
[15:02:22] <eddiemonge> knubbze_: add the z-index to the class
[15:02:46] <eddiemonge> btreecat: outputted code not pre-rendered code
[15:03:33] <kanzie> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/Abf2n/
[15:03:39] <btreecat> eddiemonge: I don't know what you are talking about, but I am using grails/gsp
[15:06:32] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: any idea why slecting nothing doesnt work?
[15:06:40] <kanzie> eddiemonge: actually, Im not even calling the local callback and the memory is still growing so it is only from actual data-loading here http://jsfiddle.net/Abf2n/1/
[15:07:22] <aaronmcadam> wtf
[15:07:27] <aaronmcadam> sort out ur fiddle man
[15:07:34] <eddiemonge> kanzie: what is call?
[15:07:37] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: not possible?
[15:07:46] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: its not html
[15:07:52] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: its a templating language
[15:08:03] <aaronmcadam> i'm certain somebody just told u to paste the *output* of it
[15:08:13] <eddiemonge> im certain too
[15:08:20] <aaronmcadam> it was u heh
[15:08:32] <eddiemonge> hey dont blame me!
[15:08:33] <aaronmcadam> i don't wanna wade through this horrible templating
[15:08:39] <aaronmcadam> hey i didnt! :D
[15:08:46] <aaronmcadam> I thought it was u who told him
[15:08:50] <eddiemonge> oh sorry, must have been coldhead then
[15:09:00] <aaronmcadam> btreecat: abstract your problem away from your actual template
[15:09:08] <aaronmcadam> btreecat don't hurt my eyes with this shit
[15:09:09] <eddiemonge> maybe i did, maybe i didnt, only darcyclarke knows for sure
[15:09:09] <aaronmcadam> :D
[15:09:15] <eddiemonge> and by extension wesbos
[15:09:24] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/dJJZp/
[15:09:26] <kanzie> eddiemonge: its a string that is passed as query string to the server with the method to run
[15:09:27] <kanzie> http://jsfiddle.net/Abf2n/2/
[15:09:36] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: if anything that makes it more of a mess but enjoy?
[15:09:38] <eddiemonge> who else can i namedrop here? ajpiano might have a reaction to kanzie
[15:09:56] <darcyclarke> eddiemonge why do you throw around my good name?
[15:10:00] <aaronmcadam> btreecat: that's the same
[15:10:06] <eddiemonge> btreecat: that did absolutely nothing
[15:10:09] <aaronmcadam> btreecat: give your example in actual html
[15:10:17] <eddiemonge> darcyclarke: because its so goood. yeah baby!
[15:10:28] <aaronmcadam> and set up your fiddle properly too
[15:10:56] <rangzen> eddiemonge: https://bitbucket.org/rangzen/jtartqage/overview
[15:11:03] <btreecat> look guys, never used fiddle before. Shit is a little whack to navigate. I thought I hit save after updating it, but there is no save button so give me a second and ill create a new one.
[15:11:22] <aaronmcadam> Update
[15:11:38] <aaronmcadam> ?g seriously just make a jsfiddle
[15:11:39] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Seriously, Just Make a JSFiddle | CSS-Tricks - http://css-tricks.com/seriously-just-make-a-jsfiddle/
[15:11:49] <Carlitta87> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/TXcG2i0E this looks different to me....is this the right way to call the function?
[15:11:50] <btreecat> http://jsfiddle.net/zcW4d/
[15:11:50] <aaronmcadam> read that quickly btreecat
[15:11:52] <eddiemonge> i dont really understand the fork button
[15:12:08] <aaronmcadam> it's so that u can rebase the fiddle
[15:12:20] <eddiemonge> rangzen wtf is that?
[15:12:35] <rangzen> eddiemonge: My first javascript ever :D
[15:13:04] <aaronmcadam> btreecat: what are u trying to clear
[15:13:04] <rangzen> eddiemonge: I charge the bookmarks.xml in index.html and want display them in tabs
[15:13:17] <btreecat> aaronmcadam: its in the comment on the jsfiddle page...
[15:13:36] <eddiemonge> btreecat: stop all the inline JS BS
[15:13:47] <aaronmcadam> he's using some sort of DSL
[15:13:49] <aaronmcadam> rotten
[15:14:00] <eddiemonge> btreecat: your clear() works just fine: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/zcW4d/1/
[15:14:11] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ rangzen
[15:14:11] <bot-t> rangzen, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:14:31] <eddiemonge> aaronmcadam: why would you do that when update creates a new save anyway?
[15:14:40] <aaronmcadam> I mean
[15:14:42] <aaronmcadam> right
[15:14:57] <aaronmcadam> somebody hands u a shit fiddle, which let's face it is nearly every one
[15:14:58] <rangzen> eddiemonge: Hum, yeah I can do that too :D One moment ...
[15:15:13] <aaronmcadam> you want to rewrite it and rebase it so u can iterate over it properly, so u hit fork
[15:15:17] <btreecat> eddiemonge: in the sence of it works, you must be using a different definition. Wen I hit clear, the same dispatcher is left
[15:15:19] <coldhead> ah, good country
[15:16:03] <Gergov> hi guys :) do you know any plugin for form styling that you would like to recommend  ?
[15:16:12] <aaronmcadam> otherwise u end up with loads of revs in the last slug, and trying to get people to read your latest fiddle can be a pain
[15:16:41] <btreecat> I just want the select element with id='dispatcher.id' to be reset to "Choose Dispatcher"
[15:16:49] <aaronmcadam> Gergov: twitter bootstrap is nice
[15:17:07] <aaronmcadam> it is reset
[15:17:19] <btreecat> I dont understand why this is trivial in prototype but not in jquery
[15:17:34] <aaronmcadam> your select does say Choose Dispatcher already
[15:17:34] <eddiemonge> btreecat: did you look at the example i posted? i am calling clear() immediately after it and it works. you probably need to do jQuery('select').val('')
[15:17:43] <Gergov> aaronmcadam, thanks ill look into it :)
[15:17:49] <aaronmcadam> eddiemonge: yeh he has that already
[15:18:04] <btreecat> eddiemonge: I did look at yours, and tested it and found it didnt work...
[15:19:26] <eddiemonge> btreecat: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/zcW4d/1/  the dates are reset
[15:20:07] <muzone> At my toggleable side menu at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cTVWS/ (a replicate of http://www.target.com/c/women-clothing-tops/-/N-5xtbq#?lnk=nav_t_spc_1_inc_2_13) - how do I make "deals", "size groupings" and "styles" start with arrow_down.png as opposed to arrow_side.png?
[15:20:11] <muzone> This fixes it - http://jsfiddle.net/cTVWS/2/ - but there's gotta be a better way to do it?
[15:20:15] <btreecat> eddiemonge: are you doing something special? I fill out the dropdown boxes, hit "enter shift" and nothing happens...
[15:20:32] <eddiemonge> btreecat: btreecat i did say hit the button. i said on page load
[15:20:40] <eddiemonge> look at the JS section
[15:20:55] <btreecat> the what?
[15:21:03] <aaronmcadam> ?jsisjs
[15:21:03] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[15:21:38] <eddiemonge> btreecat: the left bottom panel.
[15:21:45] <nsfmc> can somebody explain why .clone() would strip the contents of a script element in ie? http://jsfiddle.net/QCp2P/3/
[15:21:50] <eddiemonge> btreecat: and do you want to reset only that select or all the fields?
[15:22:22] <btreecat> eddiemonge: i want to reset dispatcher.id and have that element selected for focus after clicking a submite button
[15:24:43] <eddiemonge> btreecat: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/zcW4d/2/
[15:25:37] <btreecat> ok htf am i supposed to know i have to use \\.
[15:25:42] <eddiemonge> nsfmc: what did i tell you earlier?
[15:25:56] <btreecat> thats not in (#id) documentation...
[15:25:57] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, dude, look at the example
[15:26:00] <eddiemonge> btreecat: by reading the documentation see ? selection
[15:26:02] <bot-t> btreecat, API/1.1.2/DOM/Traversing/Selectors - This is an old version of the Selectors API: View the Current API http://docs.jquery.com/DOM/Traversing/Selectors
[15:26:22] <eddiemonge> btreecat: just kidding. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[15:26:53] <btreecat> ah
[15:26:57] <btreecat> right there at the top
[15:27:16] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, this is a different bug altogether, unless .clone() uses .text() to clone elements?
[15:27:25] <eddiemonge> btreecat: and it says it in see ? id-selector
[15:27:26] <bot-t> btreecat, ID Selector (“#id”) - Selects a single element with the given id attribute. http://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
[15:27:37] <eddiemonge> "If the id contains characters like periods or colons you have to escape those characters with backslashes."
[15:27:52] <eddiemonge> btreecat: so, yes it is in the documentation ;)
[15:28:06] <eddiemonge> nsfmc: same concept. why are you messing with the script tags anyway?
[15:28:48] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, what do you mean same concept? i can understand .text having unexpected behavior, but i don't understand .clone()'s behavior there
[15:29:49] <rangzen> eddiemonge: Can't do a demo now. Try later. Thanks anyway!
[15:30:29] <btreecat> eddiemonge: I saw it after you linked to it, must have skipped over it before. Thank you.
[15:30:35] <eddiemonge> nsfmc: i dont understand your behavior here. why are you trying to clone/mess with the script tag?
[15:31:04] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, i'm trying to understand if this is a realbug or notabug
[15:31:25] <eddiemonge> nsfmc: thats not what i was asking
[15:31:43] <nsfmc> i'm writing a dsl that uses script tags with different type attributes
[15:31:50] <nsfmc> and evaluates them in a separate context
[15:32:27] <nsfmc> but i mean, that has little bearing on whether or not .clone is showing a legitimate error or if i'm misunderstanding how clone behaves
[15:35:48] <eddiemonge> you are misunderstanding how <script> behaves
[15:35:56] <btreecat> eddiemonge: however, after cleaning stuff up, it still does not seem to be working.
[15:36:31] <eddiemonge> btreecat: did you get rid of all the sh*tty inlines?
[15:37:33] <nsfmc> eddiemonge, happy to understand what's going on, then
[15:37:53] <eddiemonge> nsfmc: ask in #jquery-dev
[15:38:00] <nsfmc> thanks
[15:38:16] <eddiemonge> nearing my #jquery quota for the day so if peeps got questions, better hurry up and ask them
[15:38:42] <eddiemonge> "#jquery quota" === "patience limit" ;)
[15:41:19] <Stephen> eddiemonge: How do I send the promise generated when I defer an $.ircWatcher("eddiemonge") UserEntered event to my friend in Africa/
[15:41:20] <Stephen> ?
[15:43:05] <btreecat> eddiemonge: that would take changing too much grails/gsp code
[15:43:25] <eddiemonge> Stephen: you send me $1,000,000 and then ill send it
[15:43:45] <eddiemonge> btreecat: so instead of doing it the easy/right way you want to do the opposite?
[15:46:12] <btreecat> eddiemonge: Hey man, I didnt write groovy/grails or the associated jQuery plugin. I just want a dollop of ajax.
[15:46:36] <eddiemonge> btreecat: you wrote the inline part for the submit right?
[15:46:49] <btreecat> eddiemonge: no
[15:47:02] <btreecat> eddiemonge: that gets generated by grails/jquery
[15:47:30] <eddiemonge> btreecat: then how are you going to change the code/add your stuff?
[15:48:15] <Stephen> Override the object prototypes of the objects Grails generates to accept the new objects as parameters on a singlet
[15:48:16] <btreecat> eddiemonge: I just use the g:remoteForm tag and its associated properties. One of which is "after" which right now, doesnt seem to even run the alert box code I added...
[15:48:37] <Shai-Tan> I have some ui tabs, and subtabs. In one of the subtabs, I have a link (edit) and I wish to load the edit form in the same tab. Is this possible?
[15:48:38] <eddiemonge> btreecat: i have idea what you just said
[15:48:38] <Stephen> Create a javascript grails object catcher
[15:48:50] <eddiemonge> Shai-Tan: yes
[15:48:55] <btreecat> eddiemonge: exactly lol
[15:49:01] <Shai-Tan> eddiemonge: how so?
[15:49:20] <btreecat> eddiemonge: http://grails.org/doc/2.0.x/ref/Tags/formRemote.html
[15:49:33] <btreecat> eddiemonge: thats what is generating the "in-line" js
[15:49:40] <eddiemonge> Shai-Tan: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#method-load
[15:49:56] <terrysutton> Hey all, how can I "inject" one div into another?    I get two divs printed out, but I want one div to *contain* the other one
[15:50:08] <terrysutton> <div class"first"> First div here</div>
[15:50:08] <terrysutton> <div class="second"> Second div here</div>
[15:50:13] <terrysutton> to:
[15:50:13] <terrysutton> <div class"first">
[15:50:13] <terrysutton> 	First div here
[15:50:14] <terrysutton> 	<div class="second">
[15:50:14] <terrysutton> </div>
[15:50:27] <eddiemonge> btreecat: listen to what Stephen said. although thats greek too
[15:50:31] <eddiemonge> ?paste @ terrysutton
[15:50:32] <bot-t> terrysutton, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:50:58] <Shai-Tan> eddiemonge: yeah, thanks, I have read that, and tried several ways from this page, non have been successful
[15:51:14] <btreecat> Stephen: sorry, I didnt even see your replies before going through backlog meow
[15:51:23] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ Shai-Tan
[15:51:23] <bot-t> Shai-Tan, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:51:55] <btreecat> Stephen: what is a grails js object catcher?
[15:52:01] <elfrancesco__> aaronmcadam: thanks man : it works now
[15:52:09] <terrysutton> Sorry guys, I should have pasted that:   http://jsbin.com/oresus/edit#javascript,html
[15:52:19] <aaronmcadam> cool
[15:53:09] <eddiemonge> ?append @ terrysutton
[15:53:10] <bot-t> terrysutton, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[15:54:10] <elfrancesco__> can someone give me the name of a good free win32 javascript editor please ? (actualy i like well notepad++ but i would love to have some completion)
[15:54:17] <terrysutton> eddiemonge: Aahâ€¦..so append() will just "inject" one div into the other, i.e.: not print the second one twice?
[15:55:39] <eddiemonge> does no one read the docs anymore?
[15:55:44] <eddiemonge> "You can also select an element on the page and insert it into another"
[15:56:01] <terrysutton> eddiemonge: just saw it that second
[15:56:07] <terrysutton> I don't know how I missed it
[15:57:38] <aro> is there a plugin that will make a column resize when another columns height changes?
[15:57:44] <joebobjoe> This seems quite simple to me, any reason this doesn't work? (Error pasted at bottom) http://tinypaste.com/d22e6b3a
[15:58:55] <eddiemonge> joebobjoe: what do you think that is supposed to do?
[15:59:01] <ajpiano> joebobjoe: what is $( newElement ).(function(){}) supposed to do
[15:59:42] <joebobjoe> Return innerHTML of newElement (I know I could simply chain .text() but I want to know why the anon function doesn't work)
[16:00:29] <joebobjoe> eddiemonge ajpiano: Should log 'Hellow form JavaScript'
[16:01:04] <ajpiano> because $().(function(){}) just ... isn't a thing
[16:01:23] <someprimetime> how can i bind two input selectors to keyup?
[16:01:33] <elfrancesco__> you can call a function this way not define one
[16:01:41] <someprimetime> i tried $($input, $textarea).bind('keyup', function() {}); but it didn't work
[16:01:53] <ajpiano> someprimetime: $("input, textarea").keyup(fn);
[16:02:01] <someprimetime> ah thanks
[16:02:04] <someprimetime> i don't need the bind then
[16:02:40] <joebobjoe> ajpiano: You can't chain anon functions?
[16:02:56] <ajpiano> nope, there's no method to invoke it.....
[16:03:04] <ABitDim> Hello, does $.ajax use the default proxy on the PC?
[16:03:06] <ajpiano> joebobjoe: i think you're looking for $().each( function() { } });
[16:03:22] <eddiemonge> ABitDim: what default proxy?
[16:03:38] <joebobjoe> ajpiano: I know I could just do $()[0]
[16:04:13] <ajpiano> joebobjoe: dereferencing an array or jQuery object numerically with bracket notation is different than just trying to slap an anonymous function next to it
[16:04:30] <eddiemonge> ?lmgtfy windows javascript ide @ elfrancesco__
[16:04:30] <bot-t> elfrancesco__, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=windows+javascript+ide
[16:04:33] <elfrancesco__> ABitDim: it will use what is configured into the browser to go on the net so the default proxy will be used else you would have many many websites not working when browsing from company behind proxies
[16:04:48] <joebobjoe> ajpiano: Hold on I'll do some reading and brb
[16:06:25] <ABitDim> Found my own answer.  It's yes.  Just that cache is by default always true.  That's why I didn't detect the call in Fiddler.
[16:06:46] <elfrancesco__> thanks eddiemonge  i was just asking for what good men like you were using (if on win32 platform)
[16:07:13] <henrico> i need help to understand last code example in: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/411688/how-to-extend-jquery-to-make-it-easier-to-retrieve-the-tagname
[16:07:42] <henrico> it is a big question to be asked in main channel
[16:07:58] <henrico> anybody willing to help me pvt-me plz
[16:08:32] <fission6> how can i count number of elements returned from a query
[16:09:18] <ABitDim> I made an ajax call on a url.  It automatically added _=1329437117558 to the query string.  What is this about?  THanks.
[16:09:34] <elfrancesco__> henrico: what do you not understand ?
[16:10:09] <elfrancesco__> $("selector").length ?
[16:10:20] <fission6> how would i find all spans with a class .label AND with .warning
[16:10:21] <eddiemonge> elfrancesco__: real men use *nix based systems
[16:10:26] <eddiemonge> women too even
[16:10:28] <elfrancesco__> lol eddiemonge
[16:10:29] <fission6> elfrancesco__: will use that for length thanks
[16:10:54] <elfrancesco__> sometimes windows is not so bad
[16:11:29] <eddiemonge> henrico: why do you care what the tagname is?
[16:11:44] <eddiemonge> ABitDim: was it a jsonp call?
[16:11:55] <elfrancesco__> but i understand ppl who feel stronger because they say they use unix based systems ;)
[16:11:57] <eddiemonge> or was cache set to false?
[16:12:10] <ABitDim> No, a call on a simple url http:/somedomain.com/abc.asp
[16:12:14] <eddiemonge> fission6: $("spans.label.warning")
[16:12:24] <ABitDim> Yes, cache was set to false.
[16:12:29] <eddiemonge> ABitDim: thats why
[16:12:35] <fission6> what if they should be inside a <div class="reply"><span...>
[16:12:44] <fission6> can i add the div portion to be more specific with my query
[16:13:38] <ABitDim> eddiemonge: Thanks.  But why?  Can give some background?
[16:14:39] <elfrancesco__> eddiemonge: and what are you using under your distro ? some gui based editor or are you one of thoses vi guru ?
[16:14:40] <eddiemonge> ?jquery.ajax @ ABitDim
[16:14:40] <bot-t> ABitDim, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:14:58] <eddiemonge> fission6: $("div.replay").find("spans.label.warning")
[16:15:07] <joebobjoe> ajpiano: I read up and I see now. I guess I'll have a right to complain once I run into a situation where chaining anonymous functions actually helps.
[16:15:28] <eddiemonge> elfrancesco__: im using macvim on mac
[16:15:42] <elfrancesco__> :)
[16:15:58] <ajpiano> joebobjoe: whatever you say :)
[16:16:08] <joebobjoe> ajpiano: Thanks.
[16:16:27] <henrico> elfrancesco__ i hope you don't mind me pvting you
[16:16:27] <ABitDim> Found it!  Thanks.
[16:16:42] <fission6> thanks eddiemonge

[16:27:16] <LittleFoot> hey i missed what u said
[16:27:20] <LittleFoot> aww
[16:27:30] <LittleFoot> y would i need to encode print '{"three": "Little birds pitch by my doorstep"}'
[16:27:41] <LittleFoot> then some1 said something
[16:28:04] <eddiemonge> LittleFoot: a lot of people said a lot of things
[16:28:55] <eddiemonge> but you need to return thr callback:  echo $_GET['callback'].'('.json_encode($yourarray).');';
[16:30:04] <LittleFoot> what is callbak
[16:30:31] <LittleFoot> view.php?callback=?
[16:30:35] <LittleFoot> what is that?
[16:30:44] <blindMoe> is this a jsonp request?
[16:30:51] <LittleFoot> yes
[16:30:59] <blindMoe> the function that will be run once the request is complete

[16:35:10] <LittleFoot> grrr
[16:35:12] <LittleFoot> photos_public.gne?jsoncallback=?"
[16:35:20] <LittleFoot> this has a diff function name

[16:35:43] <eddiemonge> LittleFoot: read those links!
[16:35:51] <LittleFoot> i am
[16:36:01] <eddiemonge> read them all, then come back and ask
[16:36:25] <LittleFoot> json p has one paragraph
[16:36:30] <LittleFoot> that doesnt explain anything

[16:37:06] <eddiemonge> seemed pretty useful to me
[16:37:42] <ndss56> Hi, help needed. Code example provided. http://jsfiddle.net/E6UZq/1/
[16:38:01] <eddiemonge> ndss56: awesome, but you forgot your question
[16:38:10] <ndss56> Question in code example
[16:38:27] <ndss56> Help is much appreciated. Thanks.
[16:40:06] <LittleFoot> i will srsrly take a pee on jsonp
[16:40:09] <eddiemonge> i dont really understand what you are trying to do?
[16:40:34] <ndss56> eddiemonge: talking to me?
[16:40:46] <LittleFoot> i guess thats what i get from staying on the cutting edge of coding?
[16:40:47] <Stephen> ndss56: var fruits = $("option",$select).val()
[16:40:54] <eddiemonge> ndss56: yes
[16:41:20] <jaequery> ot: anyone here know if att wireless logs your phone calls even if the other party has not picked up?
[16:41:20] <ndss56> Stephen: OK then how to iterate through array to check if newVal is in it?
[16:41:32] <LittleFoot> what is getDataAsJSON
[16:41:50] <eddiemonge> ndss56: why are you trying to add a new option to the select?
[16:42:12] <eddiemonge> LittleFoot: jsonp isnt cutting edge
[16:42:16] <eddiemonge> its been around for years
[16:42:22] <LittleFoot> :~~~~~~~~
[16:42:22] <ndss56> eddiemonge: because iam allowing my users to add a new option. but i also want to validate it before i insert it
[16:42:36] <LittleFoot> damit
[16:43:00] <ndss56> eddiemonge: i have not done arrays and looping through them in jQuery
[16:43:03] <eddiemonge> ndss56: why not use a combobox then?
[16:44:00] <Stephen> ndss56: if(!$.inArray(newVal, fruits.toArray()) ) { $select.append('<option selected="selected">' + newVal + '</option>'); }
[16:44:22] <Stephen> ndss56: $.inArray
[16:44:37] <Stephen> jQuery has a utility function for it :-)
[16:45:46] <ndss56> eddiemonge: hmmm combo box indeed. need to look into it.
[16:45:55] <ndss56> Stephen: utility function?
[16:46:38] <Stephen> ndss56: http://api.jquery.com/category/utilities/
[16:47:46] <ndss56> Stephen: right. i thought you meant like a jQuery UI for the whole thing.
[16:50:01] <Stephen> ndss56: Nope, you don't get off that easy
[16:50:14] <Stephen> But yes, what you are attempting to make is called a combobox
[16:50:20] <Stephen> There are many versions of it
[16:50:33] <Stephen> The only thing special you are doing is adding to the list of the combo box
[16:50:52] <MistuhKurtz> Learning javascript, I was always taught to check for the exist of things (functions, objects, etc.). I was wondering, in jQuery, should I take the effort in my site-wide script to check if an element exists before I call a plugin on it?
[16:50:55] <Stephen> This is most common in things called "Category Boxes"
[16:50:58] <Stephen> er
[16:50:58] <ndss56> Stephen: can a combo box be done purely in html?
[16:51:04] <Stephen> Category Comboboxes
[16:51:05] <MistuhKurtz> for example on most pages I have a registration form that I want to validate, but not on all pages
[16:51:23] <MistuhKurtz> should i check for $("form").length { doValidation }
[16:51:23] <Stephen> ndss56: No, but it can be done in purely css and html
[16:51:38] <MistuhKurtz> or is it fine if i do $('form').validate();
[16:51:41] <MistuhKurtz> ?
[16:52:10] <ndss56> Stephen: so what i am doing is limiting myself to people who have javascript enabled :(
[16:52:15] <Stephen> MistuhKurtz: It's fine. It will fail gracefully
[16:52:32] <Stephen> ndss56: Not exactly
[16:52:34] <MistuhKurtz> I thought jQuery had implemented it in a way that made it fine
[16:52:39] <MistuhKurtz> I just wasn't sure about the details
[16:52:46] <MistuhKurtz> and am actually a little curious about them
[16:53:00] <coldhead> people without JS are ruining the internet
[16:53:02] <Stephen> ndss56: And you should really get over the whole "I don't know if they have javascript"
[16:53:21] <Stephen> The answer is "Yes, they do"
[16:53:25] <MistuhKurtz> does it check the selector's existence automatically prior to performing any methods tied to the selector?
[16:54:06] <ndss56> Stephen: NoScript is getting popular on phone apps
[16:54:48] <Stephen> MistuhKurtz: Most of jquery's methods are available to any jquery object. Implementing .validate() on an empty form is just like looping over a 0 length array to call a function
[16:54:56] <Stephen> Simply, nothing happens
[16:55:05] <MistuhKurtz> I see
[16:55:10] <MistuhKurtz> thanks for explaining :)
[16:55:45] <Stephen> ndss56: Yup, and if you try to use script that is on your own page, likely the user will approve it
[16:56:02] <Stephen> If you try to run scripts from off-domain, then the user will likely block you
[16:56:25] <Stephen> Running local scripts Is nothing any user is going to cough at
[16:56:40] <Stephen> And this exact discussion is about 15 years too old
[16:57:00] <ndss56> Stephen: thanks for your help.
[16:57:31] <Stephen> ndss56: The only reason to do what you are attempting is if you want a convenient control on a page, and you don't want to send a new page for every action you are building into the control
[16:57:47] <Stephen> A perfectly reasonable goal
[16:58:47] <ndss56> Stephen: ahh hence the HTML + CSS combobox not so good
[17:00:11] <ndss56> do jquery var need to start with $?
[17:00:28] <MistuhKurtz> ah, Stephen
[17:00:52] <MistuhKurtz> if the funtion doesn't exist, then even if the selector you call it on doesn't exist either, then it doesn't work
[17:01:53] <MistuhKurtz> i have all my little several-line scripts and plugin calls in a single file so i know where all my own js is, but on some pages i include additional plugins
[17:02:23] <eddiemonge> ndss56: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/E6UZq/3/ ?
[17:03:04] <MistuhKurtz> so in that case i'll just continue to check for the element's existence before calling a plugin function :)
[17:03:16] <MistuhKurtz> but at least now i have some more understanding
[17:04:15] <ndss56> eddiemonge: yes. u seem to have pretty much redid the whole thing.
[17:04:22] <eddiemonge> ndss56: and?
[17:05:06] <ndss56> eddiemonge: thankyou
[17:06:00] <ndss56> eddiemonge: kinda liked Stephen version because it still had my scent in it but it doesnt work see http://jsfiddle.net/E6UZq/5/
[17:08:40] <eddiemonge>  var fruits = $("option",$select).val()  will always only give you one value
[17:09:01] <eddiemonge> ndss56: so because mine doesnt look like yours, but still works how you want and then some, you dont want to use it?
[17:09:58] <ndss56> eddiemonge: don't get me wrong yours is beautifully written but since i didnt write it i don't fully understand it thats all.
[17:10:26] <eddiemonge> maybe you should read it and break it down so you can learn from it
[17:10:32] <MistuhKurtz> But when only using native jquery functions, i suppose i can forego checking the elements' existence Stephen. thanks :)
[17:10:52] <ndss56> eddiemonge: sure, i will do that if i can't get the other one to work.
[17:11:20] <eddiemonge> humph. i do all the hard work dong things beautifully and correctly and no one appreciates it or uses it.
[17:11:53] <ndss56> eddiemonge: no, i will definately be using part of your code
[17:12:37] <ndss56> eddiemonge: i would give you a pat on the back if i could :)
[17:13:56] <acidjazz> using a .find() to find a class.. how do i manipulate only the 1st time i find that class?
[17:14:24] <acidjazz> like $('.class').find('.inner_class').addClass('.inner_hover');
[17:14:34] <acidjazz> i tried .first() in between.. no bueno
[17:16:11] <joshsmith> let's say you're hovering over something that has a particular hover state (like a darkened background)
[17:16:18] <acidjazz> ah :first works...
[17:16:19] <eddiemonge> ndss56: in plugin form : https://gist.github.com/1849494
[17:16:24] <acidjazz> so how about the next one?
[17:16:36] <joshsmith> and you bind a click event that makes that element change position on the screen away from your mouse
[17:16:49] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: $('.class').find('.inner_class').first().addClass('.inner_hover');
[17:16:50] <joshsmith> how can you remove the hover state without having the mouse move?
[17:17:12] <z1000> sup eddiemonge
[17:17:13] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: $('.class').find('.inner_class').eq(1).addClass('.second');
[17:17:41] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: or $('.class').find('.inner_class').first().addClass('inner_hover').next().addClass("second");
[17:17:50] <ndss56> eddiemonge: thanks again
[17:17:53] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: also, dont put the period in the addClass
[17:18:19] <eddiemonge> joshsmith: is the hover css or js?
[17:18:26] <joshsmith> cSS
[17:19:05] <z1000> joshsmith, why not just not add it in the 1st place?
[17:19:20] <joshsmith> what do you mean z1000
[17:19:21] <z1000> u want the hover state to remove based on what?
[17:19:28] <z1000> just do :hover {} vs having something?
[17:19:59] <z1000> or if I hover it becomes active... what would cause it to need to be removed?
[17:20:24] <joshsmith> let me demo
[17:20:25] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/SL2Rp/
[17:20:34] <joshsmith> hover over the red "Collapse"
[17:20:38] <joshsmith> it'll turn grey
[17:20:44] <joshsmith> click it and don't move your mouse
[17:20:45] <ndss56> eddiemonge: what does this do? str.slice(1)
[17:20:56] <joshsmith> the element stays grey until you move
[17:21:14] <z1000> you want to add :active or :focus
[17:22:04] <z1000> so .collapsible .collapse:focus, .collapsible .collapse:active {
[17:22:04] <z1000>     background: red;
[17:22:04] <z1000> }
[17:22:29] <z1000> cool?
[17:22:52] <joshsmith> it still is grey
[17:22:56] <eddiemonge> ?mdc slide @ ndss56
[17:23:06] <joshsmith> z1000: http://jsfiddle.net/SL2Rp/1/
[17:23:11] <eddiemonge> oi bot-t always dies
[17:23:41] <ndss56> eddiemonge: also your selected: true <-- doesn't appear to work
[17:23:59] <ndss56> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/E6UZq/3/
[17:24:05] <eddiemonge> ndss56: worked for me. what browser?
[17:24:11] <ndss56> IE8
[17:24:11] <eddiemonge> ndss56: slice splits the string
[17:24:14] <z1000> joshsmith, is that what u wanted
[17:24:34] <joshsmith> z1000: no, if you don't move your mouse, it remains grey
[17:24:45] <joshsmith> is there any way to force it back to red without doing a style override?
[17:24:56] <z1000> why would you want to?
[17:25:10] <z1000> so i hover it turns gray... then what would make it not be gray ?
[17:25:14] <eddiemonge> ndss56: try http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/E6UZq/6/
[17:25:19] <z1000> u want it to flash gray then go back to red?
[17:25:29] <joshsmith> no, I want it to hover grey as it does
[17:25:31] <joshsmith> but when you click
[17:25:44] <joshsmith> and don't move the mouse
[17:25:48] <joshsmith> I would like it to return to red
[17:25:56] <z1000> isnt that what I gave u
[17:26:00] <joshsmith> no
[17:26:08] <joshsmith> as I said, it doesn't work; check the updated demo
[17:26:15] <eddiemonge> hmm
[17:26:18] <ndss56> eddiemonge: nope, i also tried selected: "selected" <-- didnt work either
[17:30:32] <eddiemonge> who was asking about always doing:  if  ( $(selector).length > 0 ) ??
[17:30:51] <eddiemonge> in ternary the check against 0 is needed
[17:31:07] <ajpiano> no it isn't
[17:31:39] <eddiemonge> youre right
[17:31:46] <eddiemonge> im just tired and didnt type everything
[17:31:55] <eddiemonge> ndss56: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/E6UZq/7/
[17:34:38] <ndss56> eddiemonge: yeah it works now. two more questions. (1) why are there commas in:    var $i = $(this),
[17:34:38] <ndss56>   val = $i.val(),
[17:34:38] <ndss56>  (2) and what is val? not var? and why not $val?
[17:45:04] <eddiemonge> ndss56: the commas are standard javascript declaring multiple variables
[17:45:18] <eddiemonge> var a,b,c;  var a=5, b=6, c=7;
[17:46:01] <eddiemonge> ndss56: i called it val because its the value of the input. it isnt a jQuery object so i didnt put the $ in front of it
[17:46:14] <eddiemonge> the $ in front of a variable name is purely cosmetic
[17:47:15] <taipres> jquery is the best :)
[17:47:58] <someprimetime> anyone know why this works in jsfiddle but not when i transfer it into my website? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/kTA4C/1/
[17:48:28] <someprimetime> above return this.each(â€¦ i can alert stuff out there, but it doesn't seem to be hiting that each() method
[17:50:16] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: why do you always insist on creating global variables?
[17:50:29] <someprimetime> shit
[17:50:32] <eddiemonge> and not caching?
[17:50:32] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: i usually don't
[17:50:46] <someprimetime> for some reason when i name my variables prefixed with the dollar sign i forget to put var
[17:50:51] <someprimetime> thanks that'll probably fix it
[17:51:10] <someprimetime> what do you mean i'm not caching them?
[17:53:25] <eddiemonge> you have copious amounts of $(this)
[17:53:45] <someprimetime> so i should just cache it once and use that instead, right?
[17:53:49] <someprimetime> var that = $(this);
[17:57:29] <ndss56> line numbers in jsfiddle would be nice!
[17:59:09] <ndss56> dumb question but are utility functions come standard with jQuery?
[18:00:27] <eddiemonge> ndss56: define utility functions?
[18:01:14] <raj> i'm trying to figure out how to theme this thing but I'm not sure http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[18:01:27] <ndss56> eddiemonge: functions like inArray() and toArray(). I'm getting script error: object doesnt support this method/property
[18:01:53] <raj> Theming tab says some stuff about editing the css file, but I thought there'd be some js way
[18:02:39] <eddiemonge> ?inarray
[18:02:42] <eddiemonge> ?toarray
[18:02:48] <eddiemonge> oops forgot bot-t is dead
[18:03:29] <eddiemonge> ndss56: yes they are. jQuery is a all or nothing library
[18:03:42] <eddiemonge> raj: css whenever possible
[18:04:19] <ndss56> eddiemonge: right see http://jsfiddle.net/E6UZq/8/
[18:05:20] <raj> eddiemonge, i thought i'd be able to make smaller buttons and whatnot
[18:06:50] <eddiemonge> ndss56: look at what stuff is returning
[18:07:06] <eddiemonge> raj: why cant you?
[18:07:48] <raj> eddiemonge, i meant in the .tab()'s options
[18:08:00] <ndss56> eddiemonge: i am trying to alert out the $fruits.toArray() but get script error
[18:08:35] <eddiemonge> raj: why cant?
[18:09:13] <raj> eddiemonge, i don't see any such options
[18:09:15] <eddiemonge> ndss56: what does $("option") return?
[18:09:25] <eddiemonge> ndss56: what does $("option").text() return?
[18:09:54] <eddiemonge> ndss56: what does $().toArray() expect as its input?
[18:10:09] <ndss56> eddiemonge: $("option").text() gets all fruit names
[18:10:16] <eddiemonge> raj: to what? add a class to the button and have separate styles for that button?
[18:10:23] <eddiemonge> ndss56: does it?
[18:10:34] <ndss56> eddiemonge: toArray() should put it all in an array
[18:10:53] <LittleFoot> ok guys im jsonP master
[18:10:54] <ndss56> eddiemonge: when i alert it i get the names of the fruits
[18:10:57] <LittleFoot> whoooohooo
[18:11:07] <LittleFoot> cross browser scripting baby
[18:11:18] <LittleFoot> <---  XSS king
[18:11:23] <LittleFoot> w jquery
[18:11:27] <raj> eddiemonge, k
[18:11:54] <eddiemonge> ndss56: what does $("option") return?
[18:12:53] <ndss56> eddiemonge: an object
[18:13:07] <ndss56> eddiemonge: i guess a DOM
[18:14:47] <eddiemonge> it returns a jQuery collection of DOM elements
[18:15:01] <eddiemonge> ndss56: what does $("option").text() return?
[18:15:11] <atula> array of jQuery object
[18:15:27] <atula> not the .text() one
[18:15:33] <atula> I was refer to your earlier question
[18:15:40] <atula> eddiemonge: you should test it out yourself
[18:16:02] <atula> these are VERY basic question that you could get from the first page of the docs.
[18:16:04] <ndss56> eddiemonge: when i alert it out i get the names of the fruits
[18:16:27] <atula> <select>  you want to do .val()
[18:16:35] <atula> to get the selected value
[18:17:34] <ndss56> http://jsfiddle.net/E6UZq/11/
[18:17:55] <ndss56> cannot for the life of me figure out why toArray() is not working
[18:18:25] <eddiemonge> atula: you arent helping.
[18:18:47] <eddiemonge> ndss56: what typeof does $("option").text() return?
[18:19:09] <eddiemonge> atula: i know what these all return. ndss56 doesnt and im trying to impart some knowledge with a walk through
[18:19:13] <ndss56> how i check type
[18:19:32] <atula> eddiemonge: ok. carry on.
[18:19:36] <eddiemonge> console.log( typeof $("option").text() )
[18:19:44] <ndss56> i have IE8
[18:19:47] <ndss56> no console.log
[18:19:49] <ndss56> :S
[18:19:59] <atula> give him the fish :)
[18:20:00] <eddiemonge> ndss56: get on chrome or firefox asap
[18:20:11] <eddiemonge> you cannot develop JS on IE. test yes. develop no
[18:20:23] <ndss56> im restricted on what i can install on school computer
[18:20:31] <eddiemonge> ndss56: chrome frame
[18:21:08] <eddiemonge> ndss56: if your school is using IE and doesnt allow the installation of a modern browser, its time to change schools.
[18:21:14] <eddiemonge> pronto
[18:21:35] <eddiemonge> what school restricts you to IE? IE8 no less?
[18:21:40] <chee> lol. eddiemonge.
[18:21:51] <ndss56> a public school
[18:21:59] <ndss56> fixed in their old ways
[18:22:07] <ndss56> enough about the school :S
[18:22:50] <eddiemonge> thats like putting an elementary school next to a prison full of child molesters with no doors or walls between the two and the guards are on a permanent break
[18:23:32] <ndss56> yeah i'm getting molested pretty good right about now
[18:23:38] <chee> tmi
[18:23:51] <coldhead> um
[18:23:55] <eddiemonge> alert( typeof $("option").text() )
[18:23:55] <ndss56> so what type is getting returned?
[18:24:16] <eddiemonge> i cant believe i just pasted that alert. i need a shower now.
[18:24:28] <ndss56> ia string
[18:25:01] <eddiemonge> ndss56: good. now go read http://api.jquery.com/toArray/
[18:25:12] <ndss56> toArray requires an object
[18:25:16] <ndss56> and i got a string
[18:25:29] <eddiemonge> very good
[18:25:55] <acidjazz> toArray requires ur mom
[18:28:10] <eddiemonge> ndss56: now after all that, use what i linked you to =
[18:29:01] <ndss56> what link?
[18:29:52] <eddiemonge> oi. https://gist.github.com/1849494
[18:31:53] <ndss56> eddiemonge: your code is awesome but i dont get it
[18:32:12] <ndss56> eddiemonge: and if i dont get it then i cant update it
[18:33:42] <eddiemonge> what dont you get?
[18:34:20] <eddiemonge> line 1 and 29, setup an iife and pass in jQuery
[18:34:41] <eddiemonge> lines 26-28 uppercase the first letter of a string
[18:35:02] <eddiemonge> lines 2-24 create a plugin to do the combobox you want
[18:35:10] <ndss56> str.slice(1);
[18:35:22] <ndss56> why are you slicing?
[18:35:33] <eddiemonge> ndss56: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice
[18:36:06] <eddiemonge> str.charAt(0).toUpperCase()   === get the first character of the string and uppercase it
[18:36:07] <Eviltwin> At some point I just tell people to see ?learn
[18:36:22] <eddiemonge> str.slice(1)  === get every character after the first one
[18:36:31] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: have you been following this whole thing?
[18:36:51] <Eviltwin> I've seen bits and pieces
[18:37:36] <ndss56>     function ucWord( str ) {        return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);    }
[18:37:38] <ndss56> is same as
[18:37:42] <eddiemonge> i think i reached my quota almost three hours ago. dont know why im still going
[18:37:43] <ndss56>     function ucWord( str ) {        return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase()    }
[18:38:06] <eddiemonge> ndss56: is it? is it really? really? really?
[18:38:25] <ndss56> actually i get you now
[18:38:29] <Eviltwin> That's why I just steer people to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[18:38:57] <ndss56>  $this.val( selected.length ? selected.val() : val );
[18:39:30] <EasyCo> can you add more then one event to the on() method without using the map style?
[18:39:32] <ndss56> Eviltwin: you a little better than those that direct people to google.com
[18:40:38] <eddiemonge> ndss56: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation#C.2C_Java.2C_JavaScript
[18:41:02] <eddiemonge> EasyCo: $("selector").on("click mouseover mouseout blur", function() {  }):
[18:41:14] <EasyCo> That will apply to them all at once though
[18:41:15] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: If you've been going as long as you say you have, it's time to stop and take a break at the very least
[18:41:39] <eddiemonge> i was going to. this room just sucks you in. and by you i mean me. and by me i mean my soul
[18:41:54] <ndss56> selected = $this.find("option:contains('" + ucWord(val) + "')");
[18:41:55] <coldhead> so cold
[18:42:20] <EasyCo> .on("click", function(){},"mouseover", function(){});
[18:42:22] <EasyCo> That valid?
[18:44:31] <eddiemonge> EasyCo: if by valid you mean not valid then yes
[18:44:54] <eddiemonge> ndss56: selected equals find the option that has the text from the input
[18:45:03] <EasyCo> So if you want to do multiple events separately you should stick to mapping them
[18:45:15] <eddiemonge> EasyCo: or chain
[18:45:24] <EasyCo> Capiche
[18:45:28] <EasyCo> Thx
[18:45:29] <eddiemonge> or combine them like i said and then check the event.type in the callback
[18:45:29] <ndss56> eddiemonge: i understand all of your code now
[18:45:45] <EasyCo> Ooh, that's dirty that last way
[18:46:30] <eddiemonge> selected = $this.find("option").filter(function(){return $(this).text() === ucWord(val); });
[18:46:34] <eddiemonge> might be better
[18:47:05] <espringe> If I have a <select id="indicators"><option value="blah1">blah1</option>....</select> how would I get value of the selected option?
[18:47:05] <espringe> I was thining something along the lines of $('#indicators option:selected')
[18:47:08] <eddiemonge> although you should probably do a check on lowercase instead
[18:47:10] <espringe> but i'm trying to get the name, like "blah1"
[18:47:51] <eddiemonge> espringe: $("#indicators").val();
[18:48:18] <ndss56> eddiemonge: why better?
[18:51:21] <espringe> eddiemonge: $("#indicators").val(); just returns a string, which seems to be a javascript function
[18:51:23] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cTVWS/ - I have a sidebar with li's that collapse and expand - are expanded by default and some are collapsed. How do I change the arrow image for the ones that are expanded by default? Right now it's the same as the ones that are collapsed by default.
[18:51:24] <ndss56> eddiemonge: how to check lowercase?
[18:51:28] <muzone> Here is a quick fix - http://jsfiddle.net/cTVWS/2/ - but is there a prettier way to do it?
[18:51:31] <espringe> eddiemonge: am I missing something? I'm new to js
[18:52:12] <muzone> * At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cTVWS/ - I have a sidebar with li's that collapse and expand - some are expanded by default and some are collapsed. How do I change the arrow image for the ones that are expanded by default? Right now it's the same as the ones that are collapsed by default.
[18:52:29] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: your turn
[18:53:45] <espringe> I think i solved it: "$('#indicators option:selected').attr("value");"
[18:53:50] <Eviltwin> muzone: Serveral week have gone by
[18:55:03] <eddiemonge> espringe: what was wrong with .val()
[18:55:32] <espringe> eddiemonge: It returned a string that was a function
[18:55:34] <binil> muzone:define two classes for each image- and toggle between them on click
[18:55:35] <espringe> as opposed to a value
[18:55:48] <espringe> like it was a string "function(a)........"
[18:55:57] <espringe> Do I need to eval that, or something?
[18:59:14] <eddiemonge> espringe: seems right to me: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/AXGFt/
[19:02:19] <espringe> eddiemonge: Really strange, it runs fine in that jsfiddle but not for my one
[19:02:24] <espringe> i'll need to dig and figure out why
[19:03:20] <eddiemonge> espringe: sounds like your JS is broken or you have a typo
[19:04:35] <espringe> eddiemonge: Indeed. I was missing the () after 'val'. I'm too used to haskel/scala style
[19:04:43] <espringe> eddiemonge: thanks
[19:05:19] <espringe> I guess I'll know for next time, if I have an uncalled function it returns a string
[19:07:34] <eddiemonge> espringe: haskel/scala style? this is JavaScript
[19:08:22] <espringe> I have only been doing js for the last 15 minutes -- i haven't fully learnt/acclimatized to it :)
[19:09:36] <Vaerros> last 15 minutes? o.o weird to immediately start using a library
[19:11:05] <espringe> Vaerros: I inherited some code that is already using jquery and need to make some changes
[19:11:08] <espringe> :)
[19:14:30] <LittleFoot> hey guys
[19:14:46] <LittleFoot> so i am donig the cros browser scripting
[19:14:57] <LittleFoot> w ajax jsonp and jquery
[19:15:09] <LittleFoot> and making all my content in php
[19:15:12] <LittleFoot> which is awesome
[19:15:32] <LittleFoot> and i can pass things from other server into my server
[19:15:46] <LittleFoot> but
[19:16:03] <LittleFoot> how do i pass back stuff from my server into other server
[19:16:23] <someprimetime> what?
[19:16:34] <someprimetime> are you talking about making post requests?
[19:16:36] <LittleFoot> i know it sounds like too much
[19:16:42] <LittleFoot> no
[19:17:05] <LittleFoot> like lets say the other server embeds my script
[19:17:22] <LittleFoot> and passes 1 to me
[19:17:30] <LittleFoot> id=1
[19:17:35] <LittleFoot> i can colect that id
[19:17:53] <LittleFoot> and retrieve the song title for that id
[19:18:02] <LittleFoot> and show it to them in the widget
[19:18:17] <LittleFoot> but how do i make it available back to them
[19:18:25] <LittleFoot> so they can pick it up on their end
[19:18:29] <LittleFoot> with script
[19:18:58] <espringe> Just use an http request? And the result of the HTTP request is the data
[19:18:59] <LittleFoot> i guess i could just set a js var huh
[19:19:21] <LittleFoot> im not following u
[19:19:59] <espringe> Maybe open pastebin, and write the complete question there -- so you have some time to collect your thoughts. I'm not fully understanding the question
[19:25:38] <SimpleQuestion> any ideas why jquery-ui autocompletes that worked in 1.8.14 fail in 1.8.15?
[19:25:49] <SimpleQuestion> and following version
[19:26:21] <PrgmrBill> when iterate a select element, how can I access its properties?
[19:26:27] <PrgmrBill> $(this) does not seem to work
[19:27:30] <SimpleQuestion> getting some errors very similar to http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7780
[19:33:29] <tystr> I have <a href="">blah</a> <br /> <span>blah blah</span>
[19:34:27] <tystr> I have this handler on the <a> tag     .click(function() { console.log($(this).nextUntil('span'));  }
[19:34:36] <tystr> but nextUntil always returns the <br> tag...
[19:34:58] <tystr> I thought nextUntil would keep going until it matched what you specified? it's acting just like .next()
[19:36:54] <tystr> sigh
[19:36:59] <tystr> .next().next() it is, i guess
[20:10:08] <poincare101> Hi. What jQuery plugin/UI library should I use in order to get a simple modal window which as a white background in which I can put HTML content, with a small black background, white color X at the corner of the modal window.
[20:27:01] <ericandrewlewis> i'm trying to return the return from a $.post() success function to the function i called the $.post() method in. possible?
[20:27:47] <poincare101> anyone for my question?
[20:27:51] <ericandrewlewis> so that calling myfunc() returns a    :   function myfunc() { $.post(url, data, function() { return a }); }
[20:35:41] <blindMoe|2> is it possible to modify an existing classes attributes using jquery?
[20:36:13] <blindMoe|2> I know I can loop through document.styleSheets but it seems like there should be some nifty jQuery way to do it
[20:37:19] <scar2> blindMoe|2: i found this http://api.jquery.com/addClass/ -- the first comment visible and its reply has some help and example code with a fix to that person problem
[20:37:48] <mansoor-s> blindMoe|2: no just add a new class
[20:37:56] <blindMoe|2> mansoor-s: can't or i would
[20:38:03] <mansoor-s> ehh?
[20:38:12] <mansoor-s> how is that?
[20:38:14] <scar2> blindMoe|2: check that site though
[20:38:25] <blindMoe|2> scar2: I am right now.. thanks for the tip
[20:38:40] <scar2> may not help bu that person is trying to do what u do
[20:39:09] <coldhead> blindMoe|2: http://www.burnbright.co.nz/resources/globalstylesheet-jquery-plugin/
[20:39:09] <blindMoe|2> there are a couple of ways i have found to do it.. none seem very clean though
[20:39:17] <coldhead> never tried that but it looks relevant
[20:39:25] <blindMoe|2> nice thanks
[20:39:49] <scar2> blindMoe|2: look for removeClass() as well
[20:39:49] <blindMoe|2> ahh yeah that looks perfect
[20:39:59] <scar2> blindMoe|2: why not .removeClass and .addClass ?
[20:40:06] <blindMoe|2> scar2: I am not really just adding / removind classes... I want to modify an existing class
[20:40:16] <scar2> http://blog.dmbcllc.com/2008/11/19/jquery-class-manipulation/
[20:40:31] <scar2> blindMoe|2: oh u want to modify colors, etc and CSS of that class?
[20:40:52] <blindMoe|2> I am allowing users to modify colors and fonts etc. in real time then using ajax to save the values ... I want to apply the value directly to the objects they are modifying w/o having to return the entire css class in the ajax response
[20:40:53] <scar2> blindMoe|2: you probably need to have different .css theme files laying around
[20:41:13] <blindMoe|2> the script that coldhead pasted does exactly what I need
[20:41:23] <scar2> blindMoe|2: oh, wonderful :) ima look at it too
[20:42:38] <blindMoe|2> coldhead: that script is perfect... great find
[20:53:16] <kentr> Anyone familiar with beautytips?
[20:53:39] <coldhead> use a cold teabag to reduce "puffy eyes"
[20:54:15] <coldhead> scientific formulas can visibly reduce the seven signs of ageing in 12 different ways
[20:54:23] <blindMoe|2> coldhead: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/Rule
[20:55:09] <coldhead> wow that's vintage
[20:55:25] <coldhead> i wonder whatever happened to ariel
[20:58:43] <blindMoe|2> coldhead: globalstylesheets isn't much newer.. and the author actually recommend using Rule instead
[20:58:49] <blindMoe|2> +s
[20:59:15] <chee> insteads.
[20:59:26] <blindMoe|2> man time for food
[20:59:47] <blindMoe|2> chee: recommend+s
[21:13:27] <LittleFoot> hi umm
[21:13:28] <LittleFoot>  <LittleFoot> if i do an embeded script like widget.js?name=joe
[21:13:28] <LittleFoot>  <LittleFoot> how would i collect the name var
[21:14:22] <coldhead> you would have to look at $('script').attr('src') for every script in the page
[21:14:28] <coldhead> until you found the one you wanted
[21:14:36] <coldhead> then parse off the paramter
[21:14:49] <StevenCodes22> coldhead could use .each ?
[21:14:57] <coldhead> sure, why not
[21:15:07] <StevenCodes22> ;)
[21:18:29] <galvao> Is it possible to use percentages on a resizable box? Like {maxWidth: 100%}?
[21:19:20] <Mainmam> I'm trying to keep link container boxes from being nudged around when I increase the font size of a nearby link on hover. Any way to do this?
[21:20:22] <coldhead> a clock and a dream
[21:20:38] <galvao> OK, question answered by trying: not possible.
[21:20:50] <LittleFoot> coldhead, and everyone
[21:20:54] <LittleFoot> is that the right way
[21:21:57] <coldhead> LittleFoot: query strings on javascript URLs aren't a great way to pass data around
[21:22:08] <galvao> So, are there any methods to get window dimensions or should I use good ol' JS screen.availWidth and stuff like that?
[21:22:10] <coldhead> where is the data coming from?
[21:22:11] <LittleFoot> well the other way like google does it
[21:22:28] <LittleFoot> is to just pass it into the widget object
[21:22:47] <coldhead> I HAVE AMBIGUOUS DREAMS OF YOU SERENE SURROUNDED IN A SUNFLOWER SEED
[21:22:51] <LittleFoot> but i thot doing it w url would be easier
[21:23:10] <LittleFoot> for the users
[21:23:20] <coldhead> LittleFoot: the url way is fine if you can identify the specific <script> tag that includes it
[21:23:20] <LittleFoot> since most ppl are used to query strings
[21:23:30] <LittleFoot> sure can
[21:23:39] <LittleFoot> because it will contain widget.js
[21:23:54] <LittleFoot> and itwill be coming from mysite.com
[21:23:59] <LittleFoot> which i can also search for
[21:24:07] <LittleFoot> so those are the only way
[21:24:09] <LittleFoot> ?
[21:24:13] <coldhead> $('[src*=widget.js]').attr('src').split('?')
[21:24:24] <coldhead> no there are more ways
[21:24:30] <coldhead> global variables
[21:24:35] <coldhead> ajax requests for the URLs
[21:25:06] <coldhead> hack the server to literally include the vars in widget.js.php
[21:25:10] <coldhead> it depends
[21:25:46] <LittleFoot> global vars as in var name = joe?
[21:25:59] <LittleFoot> before embeding widget.js
[21:26:06] <coldhead> yes
[21:26:09] <LittleFoot> o hel no
[21:26:10] <coldhead> window.name = joe
[21:26:12] <coldhead> more like
[21:26:32] <LittleFoot> what is this literally include the vars in widget.js.php
[21:27:07] <coldhead> var name = '<?= $name_from_somewhere_else ?>';
[21:27:18] <coldhead> or words to that effect
[21:27:23] <coldhead> i am not completely serious about that
[21:27:33] <LittleFoot> u mean <script src=widget.php?name=joe
[21:27:47] <LittleFoot> and then have the php file write js
[21:28:50] <Mainmam> is there a way to see how many times an object has been clicked?
[21:28:57] <coldhead> LittleFoot: exactly!
[21:28:58] <Mainmam> .bind(click, data, etc) ?
[21:29:11] <LittleFoot> ya ive done that before
[21:29:41] <Mainmam> how?
[21:29:48] <LittleFoot> Mainmam, just add a counter
[21:29:55] <LittleFoot> to ur $().click()
[21:30:42] <Mainmam> where?
[21:30:46] <Mainmam> i'm sorry, i'm tired and slow
[21:31:00] <LittleFoot> inside the click
[21:31:07] <Mainmam> $().click('counter')?
[21:31:23] <Mainmam> $().click(index)?
[21:31:25] <LittleFoot> $('.button').click(function() { counter++ });
[21:31:32] <Mainmam> ah, cool
[21:31:33] <Mainmam> thnx, bra
[21:31:45] <Mainmam> never heard of that b4
[21:33:19] <salil> Are there any examples which can show me how to implement a horizontal/vertical scrollable array of images?
[21:33:30] <LittleFoot> i guess ishould worry about search and parse script tags
[21:33:34] <LittleFoot> sspeed
[21:33:35] <Mainmam> how do i access the counter in a variable? var x = $('.button').counter++ ?
[21:33:46] <Mainmam> last question i promise
[21:33:54] <LittleFoot> no
[21:33:57] <tw2113> it's like you think there is a question limit
[21:34:16] <LittleFoot> var counter = 0;
[21:34:25] <LittleFoot> then do ur click function
[21:34:34] <Mainmam> ah, ok
[21:34:41] <LittleFoot> beter to put ur events
[21:34:47] <LittleFoot> into a .ready()
[21:34:58] <Mainmam> ah, it's so simple
[21:35:42] <LittleFoot> var counter = 0; $(document).ready(function() {  $('.button').click(function() { counter++ });     });
[21:35:45] <LittleFoot> see
[21:39:00] <Mainmam> awww yea
[21:39:17] <_Brun0_> I need to select the first <ul> inside my $element. So I guess I could use $('>ul', $element). But jQuery docs discourage it:  "Note: The $("> elem", context) selector will be deprecated in a future release. Its usage is thus discouraged in lieu of using alternative selectors." (from http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/). What should I use then?
[21:41:41] <Juanlajara> $('$element').find('ul') ?
[21:42:04] <_Brun0_> Juanlajara, i need only the first level of ULs inside elem.
[21:42:19] <_Brun0_> Juanlajara, and there could be more of them inside those ULs.
[21:42:37] <_Brun0_> Juanlajara, i'm sorry I was not very clear about the issue.
[21:43:04] <LittleFoot> just use found[0]
[21:43:14] <Juanlajara> you mean the first ul inside the element
[21:44:01] <LittleFoot> found[0].html(';p');
[21:44:02] <_Brun0_> the first level of ul's inside $element. i mean, all the <ul> that are direct ancestors of $element.
[21:44:47] <_Brun0_> foudn it: $element.children('ul')
[21:45:05] <Juanlajara> oks
[21:45:07] <_Brun0_> LittleFoot, Juanlajara thanks both!
[21:45:41] <StevenCodes22> sup
[21:45:41] <LittleFoot> $element.children('ul')[0]
[21:45:47] <LittleFoot> ?
[21:46:28] <LittleFoot> does it work
[21:50:40] <_Brun0_> LittleFoot, it works partially since it will only select the first <ul> when I need all <ul> that are direct children of $element. Like I said, my bad for not describing the problem well.
[21:54:19] <LittleFoot> whatever u have should work
[21:54:35] <LittleFoot> $element.children('ul')
[22:15:09] <sviatovigt> hi
[22:15:18] <amirite> bye
[22:15:29] <sviatovigt> I have an variable number of divs in my page
[22:15:46] <coldhead> hey me too
[22:15:58] <sviatovigt> how can I run a loop that will add some code for each div
[22:16:09] <coldhead> ?each
[22:16:21] <sviatovigt> I need, for example, to add the hover function
[22:16:21] <coldhead> stupid bot
[22:16:26] <jedimind> ...
[22:16:34] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[22:16:36] * jedimind steps away slowly
[22:16:55] <sviatovigt> yes, but what should the collection be?
[22:17:02] <coldhead> $('div').hover(function () {alert('there was a hover');})
[22:17:08] <coldhead> you don't need each for that
[22:17:25] <sviatovigt> it's not that simple
[22:17:35] <sviatovigt> since is not the only div in the page...
[22:17:43] <sviatovigt> I need each to select the div
[22:17:47] <coldhead> $('div').each(function () { $(this).hover(function () {alert('it is not that simple')})})
[22:18:02] <Juanlajara> u get all the divs by using $('div') selector
[22:18:09] <coldhead> $('div').hover () will bind to ALL the divs
[22:18:11] <coldhead> ALL OF THEM
[22:18:12] <sviatovigt> ....
[22:18:21] <coldhead> div class="simple" and div class="not_so_simple" alike
[22:18:26] <coldhead> honey badger don't care
[22:18:39] <sviatovigt> and if I want to select only some divs
[22:18:54] <coldhead> but if you need to do something fancy with EACH indiviudal div separately, each()
[22:18:58] <sviatovigt> I have the divs named div-1, div-2, div-3....
[22:19:16] <sviatovigt> I want to use the each to select something linke
[22:19:30] <sviatovigt> $('#div'+i)....
[22:19:37] <sviatovigt> $('#div-'+i)....
[22:20:58] <coldhead> why don't you use each and inside the function you can use $(this).attr('class').match(/div-\d+/)
[22:21:00] <coldhead> or similar
[22:21:09] <coldhead> to handle the specific classes
[22:25:43] <coldhead> here i
[22:26:02] <coldhead> here is a contrived example http://jsfiddle.net/Qcn7U/
[22:26:14] <coldhead> hope you like alert()s
[22:26:55] <sviatovigt> :)
[22:26:57] <sviatovigt> thank you
[22:28:03] <sviatovigt> I was trying this: http://jsfiddle.net/GWmxA/1/
[22:28:35] <sviatovigt> but for some reason it is not working
[22:29:34] <coldhead> sviatovigt: i is an integer, and $() always returns jQuery objects
[22:29:39] <coldhead> so they will never be equal
[22:31:52] <theBrettman> what's the difference between url and action?
[22:32:24] <sviatovigt> but i will not be replaced with its value and create the element name?
[22:32:40] <coldhead> can you be more specific theBrettman
[22:33:49] <theBrettman> maybe it's a wordpress ajax thing and I think action is just a variable for the php function call...
[22:34:06] <theBrettman> I will have to look it up in wordpress docs...
[22:34:52] <rohit00082002> hello, if I use .live before element is loaded in dom then it works ok, but if I use .on it doesn't work..
[22:35:11] <rohit00082002> for click event
[22:36:37] <ansh> how can i preview an image before storing it into server using <input type= " file ">?
[22:36:51] <coldhead> sviatovigt: http://jsfiddle.net/GWmxA/2/
[22:37:07] <coldhead> that selector gets all the elements with ID starting with that stuff you start your IDs with
[22:37:12] <coldhead> but better is to use a class :)
[22:38:43] <ansh> anyone has an idea to preview an image on selection using <input type = " file ">
[22:39:21] <coldhead> ansh: i would look for a plugin to do that for me
[22:39:25] <coldhead> it's not simple
[22:39:42] <coldhead> ansh: maybe this guy https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[22:39:48] <ansh> coldhead : right now i m working with this code here http://www.zurb.com/playground/ajax_upload ,but no luck
[22:40:05] <coldhead> definitely better to have someone else to blame for these things
[22:40:09] <sviatovigt> thank you
[22:40:27] <sviatovigt> now can you please explain why is it better to use class?
[22:41:15] <coldhead> because then you can just say $('.that_class') and you don't have to use the tricky $([id^="bollocks"]') bollocks
[22:41:21] <StevenCodes22> Organized code man
[22:41:23] <ansh> coldhead: but this is storing an image to the server also ,i don't need to store it anywhere but simple show the thumbnail of the image
[22:41:30] <sviatovigt> ok
[22:41:34] <coldhead> if those elements are grouped together you should give them a common class, not rely on them having similar IDs
[22:41:45] <StevenCodes22> coldhead:  I like you
[22:41:51] <sviatovigt> but how can I know in that case on which element I'm hovering?
[22:41:51] <StevenCodes22> bet you don;t here that everyday
[22:41:52] <StevenCodes22> haha
[22:42:04] <coldhead> i usually have to pay to hear it, StevenCodes22
[22:42:06] <coldhead> thanks though
[22:42:17] <coldhead> sviatovigt: $(this) inside the function will be the element that is actually being hovered
[22:42:21] <sviatovigt> if they all have the same class
[22:42:22] <StevenCodes22> np and hopefully you pay high dollar
[22:43:24] <iateadonut> hi... i've got a function that runs an ajax call to a php file.
[22:43:30] <iateadonut> the php file generates a table.
[22:43:34] <krishna_newlife> new to javascript and jquery.. got stcuk confused.. kindly help me achieve this https://plus.google.com/103750532981930717104/posts/PbJ8xzzQJL4 with what I have here http://jsfiddle.net/Dp6aA/13/
[22:43:41] <iateadonut> with a function.
[22:43:52] <sviatovigt> ok
[22:43:55] <sviatovigt> thanks
[22:43:57] <iateadonut> so, the php generates the table like:  generateTable(infoFromAjax);
[22:43:58] <sviatovigt> I will try that
[22:44:16] <iateadonut> if i do return generateTable(infoFromAjax); and alert the result, nothing shows up.
[22:44:41] <iateadonut> should i be doing echo generateTable(infoFromAjax);return;  ... i don't think so... what is the proper method?
[22:46:36] <krishna_newlife> new to javascript and jquery.. got stcuk confused.. kindly help me achieve this https://plus.google.com/103750532981930717104/posts/PbJ8xzzQJL4 with what I have here http://jsfiddle.net/Dp6aA/13/
[22:50:20] <ansh> coldhead: wht do u suggest me for my problem?
[22:50:59] <coldhead> ansh: i would look hard for a plugin that does thumbnail previews
[22:51:06] <coldhead> i doubt you can do it yourself
[22:51:08] <coldhead> i cant
[22:51:09] <iateadonut> krishna_newlife, do you have a more specific question?
[22:53:00] <ansh> coldhead : wht about this pluggin http://www.zurb.com/playground/ajax_upload
[22:54:27] <coldhead> ansh: i've never seen that one before
[22:54:33] <coldhead> it does do thumbnails
[22:54:41] <coldhead> but they seem to be generated on the server side
[22:55:19] <coldhead> blue imp at least says this "A preview of image files can be displayed before uploading with browsers supporting the required JS APIs"
[22:55:30] <coldhead> and the other hot one is http://www.plupload.com/
[22:55:45] <coldhead> but i don't know the specifics, babe, i'm just pointing you at solutions i've heard of
[22:57:15] <coldhead> plupload doesn't seem to do thumbnails
[22:58:09] <ansh> cok means the only option is to store it onto server and download it from the server is show it?
[22:59:22] <coldhead> ansh: the blue imp uploader uses the FIle API if the browser supports it
[22:59:28] <coldhead> which means it can do it on the clientside
[22:59:52] <coldhead> i know this because i read the readme, not because i have used that feature
[23:06:30] <Mainmam> I have a horizontal nav-bar where the font-weight is increasing on rollover. There's a bit of a shuffling effect on the containers of the links.
[23:06:48] <Mainmam> What would be the best way to prevent things around increasing text sizes from moving?
[23:07:00] <mindis|wurk> fixed widths
[23:07:20] <Mainmam> ah, simple but ingenious
[23:07:24] <Mainmam> thank you sir
[23:07:43] <Mainmam> i think it's the margins or padding that's doing it
[23:07:53] <Mainmam> but there's got to be a way around it
[23:10:02] <coldhead> well good luck with everything forever, team
[23:13:02] <mindis|wurk> why oh why must css be so bad with element heights
[23:16:47] <soee> hi, if i have rel attribute like: img123 now ill get this attr and assign to variable how can i extract only part after 'img' ?
[23:17:34] <mansoor-s> soee: do you know how to get the img123?
[23:17:47] <soee> mansoor-s, yes got it already
[23:17:54] <soee> i just want to extract 123 part
[23:17:58] <mindis|wurk> you could just split it
[23:18:53] <mansoor-s> so   var foo = "img123";  foo.substring(3, substring.length - 1);
[23:19:32] <soee> ok thank you both
[23:23:17] <iateadonut> i've got a variable, url = the id of an input field.  i want to get the value of that input field.  $('#'+url).val()  - is not working.
[23:23:48] <soee> mansoor-s, working version: currentIndex = foo.substring(3, foo.length);
[23:24:03] <mindis|wurk> if your url is a real url then it may contain characters not allowed in id
[23:25:05] <iateadonut> ah.  periods aren't allowed, huh?
[23:25:51] <mindis|wurk> periods should be okay though i personally wouldn't use them
[23:26:05] <mindis|wurk> but slashes etc. are not ok

[23:35:38] <kmowery> hi all. I'm running into a very strange bug at the intersection of jQuery, canvas, and base64 encoded PNGs.
[23:35:50] <kmowery> a minimal example is here: http://canta.ucsd.edu/~kmowery/png/what.html
[23:36:51] <kmowery> i expect the png to be inserted into the canvas, but that's not what happens; unless the code runs in chrome's debugger (then it works)
[23:37:32] <kmowery> does this look like a jQuery or a browser (or a kmowery) issue?

[23:55:53] <DukeDrake> hi
[23:56:11] <DukeDrake> I have a .each() loop with inline functions which do a little ajax
[23:56:23] <Luffha> hi
[23:56:36] <soee> how can i check if some element got some content, for example paragrtaph contains some text?
[23:56:43] <Luffha> how do i select all H1 with class="title"?
[23:57:21] <DukeDrake> now I'd like to execute the next line of code _after_ the last ajax from the each-loop reported back ... but it's being executed much earlier :/
[23:57:35] <Juanlajara> $('h1 .title') ?
[23:58:56] <Juanlajara> Ajax means for asynchronous so you may expect that, its not a good thing but you can set up your $.ajax to be synchronus
[23:58:56] <john-dev> soee, $('#div').text() or even $('#div').html()
[23:59:06] <Juanlajara> s
[23:59:34] <john-dev> DukeDrake, do you use it'S onSuccess function?
[23:59:41] <Luffha> thanks Juanlajara
