[00:02:36] <balr0g> hello, im trying to implemet this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/ but im not sure what CSS & JSs do i must to include, please help
[00:06:50] <lisak> quys I have this  form with checkbox input field  http://jsfiddle.net/Jw7qD/
[00:07:22] <lisak> but the value of the input field isn't used as get parameter
[00:07:57] <lisak> there are simply no get params what so ever
[00:08:07] <lisak> no matter how many input fields the form has
[00:08:13] <lisak> how do I do that ?
[00:08:36] <lisak> http://jsfiddle.net/Jw7qD/1/
[00:10:38] <Cork> lisak: how do you do what?
[00:11:19] <Cork> add the input fields in the submit?
[00:11:57] <beasty> how far is a .parent() going ?
[00:11:59] <mindis|work> how do you enable designmode on a jquery created iframe?
[00:12:15] <Cork> beadza: this.parentNode()
[00:12:24] <Cork> beadza: as in direct parent
[00:12:33] <Cork> ?.closest @ beasty
[00:12:34] <bot-t1> beasty, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:13:31] <beasty> ah thanks
[00:13:44] <Cork> opps wrong nick... sorry :x
[00:14:08] <Cork> "beadza" was for you too ;P
[00:14:41] <webPragmatist> if (now.getTime() > countUp.getTime())  << is that right?
[00:14:42] <sphinxxx> anyone else have trouble with fancybox auto size?
[00:14:45] <webPragmatist> assuming countUp is a Date90
[00:14:50] <webPragmatist> Date()
[00:15:18] <webPragmatist> and now is new Date()
[00:15:50] <Cork> webPragmatist: yes
[00:15:53] <beasty> Cork: thanks the .closest did it :)
[00:16:12] <lisak> Cork, I want the values of the input fields to become get request parameters
[00:16:17] <webPragmatist> ah i'm a dumby and forgot to set now to new Date() lol
[00:17:03] <Cork> lisak: then that should work, as long as the input fields are correct
[00:17:29] <joshsmith> I'm iterating through a set of all list items on the page using $.each
[00:17:50] <joshsmith> how can I get the index of the parent ul of that list item from within that $.each fn?
[00:20:14] <Cork> $(this).parent().index() you mean?
[00:20:22] <Cork> or do you mean the selector array index?
[00:21:44] <Cork> lisak: http://jsfiddle.net/Jw7qD/2/
[00:22:09] <joshsmith> Cork: I think that did it for me
[00:22:31] <joshsmith> pushing to prod to see if it did indeed work
[00:27:04] <lisak> it doesn't work for me, looking at the request at chrome dev tools and server too
[00:53:10] <lisak> http://jsfiddle.net/Jw7qD/5/  just doesn't work
[00:53:55] <disappearedng> Can someone tell me why this causes an error in fail.js? https://gist.github.com/55e5a8818f451de4cdb3

[01:01:00] <michealyang> hi
[01:01:15] <michealyang> hello
[01:02:31] <michealyang> i has some problem on the plugin
[01:02:42] <michealyang> Is there anyone can help me ?
[01:04:38] <Taai> Hi, is there a way to reach original (unmodified/unfixed) event on keypress?
[01:05:09] <michealyang> yes
[01:05:18] <michealyang> that is my problem
[01:05:40] <Taai> Yeah, mine too... Solution?
[01:06:02] <xec> Taai: i actually wasn't aware that you got a modified event, what's the difference?
[01:07:02] <EdwardIII> harrumph
[01:07:08] <Taai> The event.which gets modified
[01:11:03] <Taai> The real problem is that the charcodes of right arrow and apostrophe (') buttons are the same on Opera. But I found out that on keypress the event.which is null when apostrophe button gets pressed, but on right button it's 39. I need to get the original event.which!
[01:11:36] <redfox> how to execute javascript code which is retrieved via $.ajax() ?
[01:12:06] <michealyang> the same problem to me
[01:16:02] <Taai> Look at "keyHooks" in the jQuery source - there this event.which get's fixed. Can anyone tell me is there possibility to reach the original event instead of "fixed"?
[01:20:04] <Taai> Found it! event.originalEvent.which  :)
[01:20:49] <Taai> michealyang: here you go ;)
[01:21:28] <klusias> how to get json string from object? there is serializeArray etc, but it works only for form elements
[01:21:42] <xec> Taai: have you tried e.originalEvent ?
[01:22:18] <Taai> Yes, that's what I just found! My problem is now solved. Thank you! :)
[01:23:30] <xec> oh right sry
[01:23:50] <xec> it's early here, havent opened my eyes yet :|
[01:24:38] <michealyang> It is nearly night
[01:25:36] <mindis|work> i wish the opensource community learned how to document their products. how frustrating it is to find an app that seems good but has no instructions
[01:27:00] <xec> just read all the source code, should tell you how it works. :D
[01:27:42] <mindis|work> yeah and that's exactly the wrong attitude :P
[01:28:22] <mindis|work> it is only surpassed by "do it yourself" mentality
[01:34:04] <xec> i love jokes that you have to explain. makes them last longer
[01:34:23] <mcnellis> I'm passing a function name into keyup e.g. $(selector).keyup(fFoo); Is there a way that I can pass a variable into fFoo when the handler is executed?
[01:35:38] <mcnellis> I have this bit of code on several different pages on my application, and different pages need to pass a different value into the handler function
[01:36:26] <xec> mcnellis: .keyup(function(){ Foo("argument") })
[01:36:47] <mcnellis> Ah! Excellent solution, thanks!! :)
[01:37:00] <xec> :)
[01:43:04] <SinnerNyx> is there some reason why $('a').click(function(){alert('test');}); would not work?
[01:43:52] <codemagician> I have a tree structure consisting of <li> with 3 <span> elements contained within.  I have the <span> selected.. but how do I get the container <li> node?
[01:44:23] <EdwardIII> codemagician: $(this).parent().parent().parent()?
[01:44:41] <xec> SinnerNyx: don't see anything wrong with that snippet
[01:44:51] <mindis|work> SinnerNyx might get overridden by the anchors default behaviour?
[01:45:12] <xec> SinnerNyx: do you get any errors in console? is that line run in document ready event?
[01:45:58] <SinnerNyx> mindis, right forgot to put return false in that. it's run in doc ready, but when I click on the anchor nothing happens. I've tried replacing it with referenceToAnchor.onclick=function()...
[01:46:00] <SinnerNyx> and it works
[01:46:20] <SinnerNyx> so it seems to me like maybe a bug in jq?
[01:46:28] <mindis|work> codemagician if they're like <li><span /></li> then you can get <li> by $('yourspan').parent();
[01:46:48] <xec> SinnerNyx: doubt it
[01:47:08] <SinnerNyx> xec fair enough, but i don't get it :S. i'll try to play around with it more
[01:47:09] <xec> SinnerNyx: http://jsfiddle.net/HdKqD/1/
[01:47:17] <xec> SinnerNyx: copypasted your snippet
[01:47:37] <xec> the event runs before the link is followed by browser
[01:47:41] <xec> at least in firefox
[01:48:30] <SinnerNyx> xec, my full code is long and convoluted. i'll try to remove portions of it until it works or it becomes pastable. will let you know
[01:49:09] <xec> SinnerNyx: maybe you have multiple event handlers on the same anchor, and the first one is preventing bubbling?
[01:49:39] <sennahoj> hey, anyone here using sammy.js?
[01:50:04] <xec> ?closest @ codemagician
[01:50:11] <SinnerNyx> xec, i thought about something about those lines, but then wouldn't onclick fail as well? additionally i looked through my code the only events i'm hooking in the same code is dragstart,dragend,dragenter,dragover,dragleave.
[01:50:15] <xec> wheres the bot =(
[01:50:34] <xec> SinnerNyx: no, onclick is different iirc
[01:50:43] <xec> SinnerNyx: does addEventHandler work?
[01:50:55] <SinnerNyx> xec o rly? i'll try addeventhandler now
[01:51:23] <xec> SinnerNyx: you can only have one onclick, so when it is set it will overwrite any earlier onclick
[01:51:48] <xec> SinnerNyx: but you can attach multiple event handlers with addEventHandler (or attachEvent in IE)
[01:52:17] <xec> codemagician: try .closest('li')
[01:53:25] <codemagician> I got the parent now thanks.   I'm using dynatree and trying to get it to work with another context menu
[01:53:39] <SinnerNyx> xec, addeventlistener still works :S
[01:54:47] <codemagician> the thing I wasn't wasn't even on the parent node after all that
[01:54:50] <codemagician> :/
[01:55:40] <SinnerNyx> i'll need to download the development version of jquery link to it and go through the click function and try to figure out what's going on. i can't do it right now, but i'm sure i'll be back here to pester you some more
[01:56:29] <xec> SinnerNyx: thats strange, as i believe the jquery bindings use addEventListener internally
[01:56:52] <codemagician> Has anyone had any experience with Dynatree?
[01:57:38] <codemagician> I labeled my <li> tree nodes with id=54, id=55 etc so each would be unique. but when dynatree renders the structure it seems to remove the id attributes from the <li> nodes
[01:57:42] <xec> codemagician: nope, but someone might be able to take a look anyway, if you're able to make a test case at jsfiddle.net or link to a live site and give instructions
[02:02:59] <SinnerNyx> xec, i can believe that. i completely agree with you that it is likely a bug by something i've done on my end. i'll let you know if i catch anything.
[02:03:38] <codemagician> On this page. Using the default options example (first in the list on left menu)  http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/samples.html
[02:04:30] <codemagician> The source code shows the <li id="xyz">  but chrome browser doesn't show any attributes associated with the <li> element after the dynatree has done its magic
[02:08:12] <xec> codemagician: what is this "xyz" you speak of, and what are you trying to do?
[02:08:57] <codemagician> xec: I'm trying to put attributes on the line elements with id=45, id=46  a unique identifier which matches my database nodes
[02:09:30] <codemagician> xec: but on calling dynatree the attributes are stripped from the parent node, when it attaches the <span> elements
[02:10:04] <xec> codemagician: i don't see any id's in the original source
[02:10:57] <codemagician> xec: view the frame source for the "default options" example
[02:11:16] <xec> i am :)
[02:11:29] <codemagician> http://pastebin.com/kjwkyUSY
[02:12:10] <codemagician> xec: each LI has an attribute id="id1" and so on...
[02:12:22] <xec> codemagician: did you save the file? upload to server? like i said, i don't see the id's in the code
[02:12:24] <dddbmt> I have an element like <elm>10</elm> - is there an easy way to add +1 to $("elm").html() ? So i becomes <elm>11</elm> ?
[02:12:30] <dddbmt> i=it
[02:12:35] <codemagician> xec: which browser are you using
[02:12:47] <codemagician> xec: view the page source, not the modified dom tree
[02:15:31] <Logitec> Good morning jQuery.
[02:15:54] <Logitec> I have a question, which parameters could be used to identify a specific line?
[02:16:27] <Logitec> For example, on a td, I have id which identifies a certain group and a class which identifies its part of another group.
[02:17:16] <Logitec> Now I need to make sure it is identified as something else as well, which parameter could I use for that?
[02:17:31] <mindis|work> .data()?
[02:18:34] <Logitec> I'm afraid this method is too complex for what I am trying to achieve.
[02:18:52] <mindis|work> what? why would it be :D
[02:19:04] <mindis|work> it's no more complex than setting a class or an id
[02:19:43] <Logitec> Possibly but I'm not farmiliar with it, so I'm afraid it will consume too much time
[02:19:51] <Logitec> I'll elaborate, the following situation;
[02:20:09] <mindis|work> it just sets an attribute
[02:20:33] <mindis|work> .data('not', 'complex') sets an attribute data-not="complex"
[02:20:51] <mindis|work> you can't possible say it's too complex
[02:22:42] <Logitec> Ah.. I see how it works now, thats exactly what I need!
[02:23:02] <Logitec> Sorry.. a little stressy with a deadline approaching
[02:23:05] <Logitec> Thanks a lot
[02:23:23] <mindis|work> no problem, i'm dying with my own problem right now myself
[02:27:03] <Sil4nc4> hi uys
[02:27:16] <Logitec> Wish you good luck, mindis|work
[02:28:04] <Sil4nc4> i use the crsftokenvalidation option to protect my forms, but it seems that it cannot handle redundant web setups. It says: The CSRF token could not be verified.
[02:28:44] <xec> codemagician: sry was afk. using firefox, i'm viewing original source, not through firebug.
[02:29:05] <codemagician> xce: of the inner frame?
[02:30:38] <codemagician> xce, view-source:http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/sample-default.html
[02:30:51] <codemagician> source:http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/sample-default.html
[02:30:57] <codemagician> sorry it won't paste
[02:31:13] <codemagician> xce: http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/sample-default.html
[02:32:21] <codemagician> ice, i've looked at the dynatree source javascript and it appears that it doesn't preserve the attributes and rebuilds the tree internally
[02:32:49] <jetienne> q. is there a event clickstart / clickend
[02:33:18] <jetienne> mousedown is the name! thanks everybody :)
[02:37:29] <JaredCE> morning world. quick question... i have a form that contains 2 buttons and a submit along with various input fields. when i'm in one of the input fields and hit enter, it activates the first button in the form for some reason. my code looks like: $("#buttonname").click(function(){stuff; return false;});
[02:39:09] <johanhar> which plugins for trees do you guys use? I think I want a new one, now I am using dynatree.
[02:40:14] <Sil4nc4> huh, why is it that i get 'The CSRF token could not be verified.' on my redundant web setup and not on my local box?
[02:40:36] <Sil4nc4> can i fix this somehow?
[02:42:54] <gianiaz> hi, it exists a selector that match elements that has an exact match with "text" in it?
[02:43:31] <gianiaz> I've found contains, but if I'm looking for <a>1</a> it matches also <a>11</a>
[02:44:50] <edulterado> hi, I was wondering which is the best practice for hiding a HTML element before the DOM is loaded, I would like to avoid blinks when hiding it with jquery and I don´t want to set display element as none in CSS for accessibility issues
[02:45:19] <gianiaz> edulterado, document ready?
[02:46:41] <Hooloovoork> edulterado: there's prolly no reliable way to do that. css is the best way imo
[02:46:43] <gianiaz> edulterado, I don't think javascript can access the dom before the dom is loaded?
[02:47:28] <edulterado> gianiaz: I see, maybe I have to clarify myself some basic concepts
[02:48:15] <edulterado> but anyway, when using document.write with javascript, you´re adding content while the page is still loading, right?
[02:50:03] <kidjes> hello
[02:50:13] <kidjes> my name is Rkidjes
[03:05:45] <_ramo> hi
[03:06:32] <_ramo> is there a jquery script where i can achieve the follwoing: i have x pictures on my site, if i hover over these picutres, an transparent overlay should be set with three links (images) ?
[03:18:13] <verwilst> hello!
[03:18:39] <verwilst> i have multiple divs as columns, and i can drop 'items' (other divs) between columns
[03:18:49] <verwilst> so that works, but now i want to save those to mysql :P
[03:19:01] <verwilst> i managed to get an array to an update function
[03:19:18] <verwilst> but that's only good when you have 1 div, since it only shows the items in 1 div
[03:19:30] <verwilst> how do i do it with cross-div dropping?
[03:23:32] <Procu> verwilst: after drag get item ID and new div ID then make ajax request to php file. In php file just update positions in db
[03:25:08] <verwilst> Procu, how do you get the item id and new div id?
[03:26:24] <Procu> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#shopping-cart
[03:26:28] <Procu> event drop
[03:26:58] <verwilst> Procu, hm, im using sortable
[03:27:16] <Procu> sortable between columns ?
[03:27:24] <verwilst> myeah.. seems to work :D
[03:27:30] <verwilst> except for the saving :P
[03:28:14] <Procu> you need to use dropable
[03:30:47] <Procu> and in droppable $(this) represents div where you droped item
[03:30:55] <Procu> and ui.draggable represents item
[03:31:00] <Procu> that's all
[03:38:12] <zatan> Hi i am using jquery post and I am gettint returned data like this [{ "Company": "aaa","Barcode": "(B145YF1J1)"}] I am using function(data){  how can I alert just company ? alert(data.Company) is not working
[03:38:12] <Hooloovoork> zatan: console.log(data[0]["Company"])
[03:38:12] <Hooloovoork> it's in an array
[03:38:26] <zatan> Hooloovoork, thank u  its working nice ;)
[03:38:57] <Hooloovoork> zatan: np
[03:40:01] <mindis|work> what the hell. you can't create editable iframes in runtime with firefox? sheesh. now i'm completely stuck
[03:46:34] <SpoonKing> hi, been trying to create a draggable element using mousedown, what would be the best way to do this?
[03:47:36] <Hooloovoork> jqueryui
[03:47:46] <Hooloovoork> ?jqueryui @ SpoonKing
[03:47:56] <Hooloovoork> ow he didn't know that one
[03:48:18] <Hooloovoork> where's bot? D:
[03:51:12] <SpoonKing> Sorry, should have said, with out includuing a plug in
[03:52:40] <Hooloovoork> SpoonKing: It's not that hard. Move it on the mousemove event if mouse is down.
[03:54:08] <Hooloovoork> SpoonKing: there will be some stuff you have to do to keep it centered to where you clicked when you started dragging etc, but i'm sure you can solve that.
[03:55:30] <Hooloovoork> hmm or maybe not
[03:55:39] <Hooloovoork> just move it relative to starting position
[03:55:47] <Hooloovoork> (where you clicked when started dragging)
[03:56:20] <SpoonKing> Hooloovoork, just not sure how to test for the mouse down event. Have it set that way, so that on mouse move it changes the left and right margin and slides along, but its awkward and clunky with the mousedown event only fiing once.
[03:58:59] <AdvoWork> I'm doing var anSelected = fnGetSelected( oTable ), and then console.log(oTable); basically shows my table, yet anSelected is blank. Any suggestions please?
[03:59:13] <Hooloovoork> this is really not that hard to do. var mouse_state = 0; var current_element; $("#draggable").bind("mousedown", function() { mouse_state = 1; current_element = this; }); $("body").bind("mousemove", function(ev) { if(mouse_state == 0) return false; //Do move the current_element here })
[03:59:48] <Hooloovoork> already minified!
[03:59:56] <Hooloovoork> so that's for production use
[04:01:27] <AdvoWork> if console.log returns []  is that blank/empty?
[04:01:59] <Hooloovoork> SpoonKing: umm also that code will prolly mess stuff up. you have to change things so it behaves properly =P
[04:02:20] <Hooloovoork> i made some bad decisions =P
[04:05:30] <Kingsy> anyone in here use http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/ <--- ?

[04:29:51] <ChristianAdamski> Hi, I want to download this plugin: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/TagCloud but I seem to be unable to find the download link :(
[04:32:09] <snagnever> good morning
[04:32:24] <zulax> what is the technical term for functions like $(this).click( function() {});
[04:32:34] <zulax> is that like lambda on python?
[04:35:32] <Hooloovoork> zulax: what do you mean?
[04:35:50] <Hooloovoork> you mean the callback function?
[04:35:57] <Anime> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function
[04:36:11] <zulax> maybe anonymous is what i m looking for
[04:36:16] <zulax> thx
[04:36:54] <zulax> so its the same as lambda in python?
[04:37:21] <ChristianAdamski> Seriously: how do I download a jquery plugin?
[04:37:58] <dr0id> Seriously? heh
[04:38:10] <zulax> ChristianAdamski, i had same problem
[04:38:17] <zulax> i think they made it complex
[04:39:10] <ChristianAdamski> I just want a small jquery plugin called TagCloud. Is this not possible anymore?
[04:40:31] <zulax> ChristianAdamski, wouldnt the plugin come with the necessary jquery files?
[04:41:13] <ChristianAdamski> This website of the plugin doesn't offer any downloads, it just links to the jquery site
[04:42:35] <zulax> ChristianAdamski, http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/tag-cloud-plugin
[04:42:38] <zulax> is it that one?
[04:42:44] <ChristianAdamski> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/TagCloud this one
[04:44:47] <zulax> i cant even get to the donwload page :(
[04:45:30] <zulax> i get there are no published releases
[04:47:24] <ChristianAdamski> Okay, I found the file somewhere else. Thx & bye
[04:47:25] <shwaiil> hi
[04:49:48] <shwaiil> Q: I run a function that consists in doing a .animate(), this is triggered every time the user clicks a "key". The issue is, if the user press the key more then once in a fraction of the "animate()", it goes twice and gets screwed. I'm wondering if there's a way to stop "key" of triggering the animate() ? Thanks for looking. I tryed to use a VAR as a Flag (kept true) till the animate() sucess who would set to false.
[04:49:56] <shwaiil> Any tip is appreciated, thank you.
[04:50:52] <wolfehr> does droppable not work on jsfiddle?
[04:51:05] <wolfehr> (or draggable)
[04:51:13] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: do .stop().animate();
[04:51:30] <wolfehr> (ignore that, it works fine, just noscript interferes)
[04:52:22] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: you could have a lock variable too, but i don't think that will work as well
[04:55:36] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork: thabnks for looking: What type of variable is that one ? "lock" ? :) the .stop()..hummm wondering if will work, thanks i'll try
[04:55:59] <wolfehr> pah... I actually cant get droppable/draggable working properly on jsfiddle to even show my problem!
[04:57:04] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: well a lock varable can have whatever name you want. just do var lock = 0; and when you start animating you do lock = 1; and each time you run the animation you check to see if it's 1, in which case you don't run the animation code. on the completed callback of the animation you set the lock to 0 again.
[04:57:54] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork: yeah, that's what I've tryed :) tks
[05:00:25] <oxez> Hello. If I have something like that: <h1>Heading</h1><p>hello</p><h1>Heading for something else</h1><div>why hello again</div> -- How can I wrap everything that between my <h1>'s with <div class="special"> ? So that I will have: <h1>...</h1><div class="special">...</div><h1>..</h1><div class="special">more...</div> ?
[05:00:29] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Thanks for the crown but I'm already on the access list for this # :P
[05:00:55] <Eviltwin> And it looks like the ops prefer to stay anonymous here
[05:00:57] <wolfehr> Hi guys, I've got an issue with positioning of an element when show('explode'), firstly it isn't positionined correctly directly over the element it should be (apparent in demo, drag the left black box (above behaviour) over a pupils black box), secondly, I can't animate the hide of it at all (http://jsfiddle.net/pynWW/1/)
[05:01:07] <Eviltwin> So I won't make waves
[05:02:14] <wolfehr> *correction to above, drag the right black box (the left one is a merit, the right one is a demerit, but i've stripped the merit code for the minute)
[05:04:46] <Eviltwin> oxez: Perhaps something like $("<div>").append($("h1").nextUntil("div")).insertAfter("h1")?
[05:04:54] <Eviltwin> oxez: You can look up the pieces at api.jquery.com
[05:05:45] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone know of a relationship charting solution for javascript almost like a spider graph?
[05:06:50] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Check out http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ maybe?
[05:07:10] <jeffsmykil> ty
[05:08:26] <angelete2> hi
[05:08:41] <angelete2> i have a problem with tabs and iframes
[05:08:55] <angelete2> i have a google maps inside a frame that is inside a tab
[05:09:22] <angelete2> when i choose this tab it works nice on ie7 and chrome, but not in ie 8/9
[05:09:28] <angelete2> what should i do?
[05:10:10] <scratcha> can anyone see anything wrong with this ? 			$(this).stop().animate({backgroundPosition:"(0px 0)"}, {duration:500});
[05:19:37] <oxez> Eviltwin: I could not get that to work, I'm trying in another way. But I'm wondering if there's a way to use .prepend() and .append() with unclosed html elements? So I could use .prepend() on h1 elements to add my closing + opening <div>, with a special treatment to the first and last ones
[05:20:12] <oxez> I could also add .before() and .after() to my question
[05:20:59] <rahmen> Hi! Is it possible to wait for ajax before returning anything in a function? Example: http://pastebin.com/F70FzgKM
[05:22:07] <Jon47> rahmen, you're looking for promises and deferreds
[05:22:40] <Jon47> but basically.. what you're asking for isn't really an option
[05:22:45] <Jon47> you gotta change the way you think about it
[05:23:36] <rahmen> Ok... so I'll change getSomething to doSomething instead I guess
[05:23:59] <wolfehr> rahmen, you can check a variable to determine if its been set by the ajax method, but not ideal really
[05:24:21] <Procu> you can just return it on ajax success
[05:24:22] <Procu> -.-
[05:24:59] <rahmen> Procu: no, I can't since it's not synchronous
[05:40:07] <mantas322> Good Morning Bros..
[05:42:21] <imc> hello! (alternative) url of jquery.mobile-1.0, anyone?
[05:43:49] <mantas322> u mean the google one imc?
[05:43:51] <Kambfhase> imc http://jquerymobile.com/download/
[05:44:08] <imc> thanks
[05:44:28] <imc> mmm
[05:44:30] <imc> are you kidding?
[05:44:44] <imc> the real url is : http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0/jquery.mobile-1.0.min.js
[05:44:46] <imc> try it out
[05:44:58] <imc> if i'm asking is exactly because code.jquery.com is down
[05:45:27] <imc> so... a local copy would be great
[05:45:45] <imc> meaning i can do some work done today instead of turning my thumbs :)
[05:45:53] <Kambfhase> did you check my link? there are downloads, git repos and CDNs
[05:46:21] <imc> github, great :)
[05:46:22] <imc> thanks
[05:47:22] <imc> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tarball/1.0 <-- this is it
[05:51:49] <nVee> hey guys. Is there like a live event listener which will wait for a dom element to change before it does something?
[05:52:40] <wolfehr> what do you mean by change?
[05:54:18] <nVee> well, in short, I have a default input value. While that value is "default", I want <div id="content"><p>Please enter a name ...</p></div>
[05:54:32] <nVee> so while the input field is default or changed back to default, it should have that content
[05:54:51] <Hooloovoork> nVee: bind to keyup event on the input box
[05:56:57] <mantas322> could there be a potential issue if im using multiple jQuery js files across the same app?
[05:57:16] <mantas322> like if my initial page loads one jquery.js file and another load a different version
[05:57:20] <Hooloovoork> mantas322: yes
[05:57:24] <mantas322> would this overlap cause them not to play nice
[05:57:35] <mantas322> Thats what i thought hooloovoork
[05:57:48] <Hooloovoork> mantas322: keep enough structure on your app so it doesn't happen =)
[05:58:03] <Hooloovoork> that's a good idea even if they do play nice with each other.
[05:58:12] <nbari> hi all, i am using $.ajax to get from php some status info true/false my question is, for properly handling the true/false it is ok to reply from the php something like json_encode('status' => true/false) or it is a better way ?
[05:58:14] <mantas322> well i just got to this thing, I didnt write it im just trying to figure out whats happening
[05:59:08] <mantas322> im never going to figure out what this is Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[05:59:09] <eutheria> excuse the newbie question, can i get jquery and ui from a CDN?
[05:59:20] <mantas322> all i knwo is everythign works w/o this jquery.js file
[05:59:25] <Hooloovoork> eutheria: you can get it from googles cdn
[05:59:58] <mathi> hi
[06:00:15] <Hooloovoork> mathi: hi
[06:00:34] <mathi> question about jquery ui tabs: how can I ientify the selected tab? I see I can get the index, but what if the tabs are dynamically positionned?
[06:01:23] <Hooloovoork> mathi: don't they have a selected class?
[06:03:15] <mathi> ah.. ui.tab  returns the anchor element
[06:03:19] <mantas322> a.mobile.loadPage.a.mobile.allowCrossDomainPages.i.isSameDomain.a.ajax.success
[06:03:26] <mantas322> what the guff!
[06:05:03] <mathi> got it working thank you
[06:05:45] <EAN407> can i use draggable and clickable on the same element? or will this work not together
[06:07:10] <Paulloz> hi there
[06:10:18] <scratcha> anyone see whats wrong with this? it just stopped working; $(this).stop().animate({backgroundPosition:"(0px 0)"}, {duration:500})
[06:10:45] <Eviltwin> Why are there ()'s around the numbers?
[06:12:03] <Paulloz> i was wondering if it was possible to know if an unload event was triggered by refresh ?
[06:15:40] <Eviltwin> Paulloz: I think maybe the referrer is set to the current page
[06:16:05] <mantas322> Is there some special way to make link tags if you're using jQuery???
[06:16:08] <mantas322> <a href="/mypage.html">HELLO</a>
[06:16:24] <mantas322> I know this isnt the problem but i thought i'd ask
[06:16:33] <Eviltwin> oxez: There's no such thing as "unclosed elements"
[06:16:39] <Eviltwin> Elements are elements
[06:17:01] <Eviltwin> mantas322: $("<a>",{href:"/mypage.html",text:"HELLO"}) ?
[06:17:10] <mantas322> ur kidding me
[06:17:16] <Eviltwin> That works
[06:17:17] <Paulloz> mantas322, like $("<a>").attr("href", "/mypage.html").text("HELLO"); ?
[06:17:24] <Eviltwin> You could also do what Paulloz suggested
[06:17:30] <Eviltwin> Or $('<a href="/mypage.html">HELLO</a>')
[06:17:35] <Eviltwin> All three produce the same result
[06:18:06] <Paulloz> Eviltwin, actually i have a function on unload event
[06:18:16] <Eviltwin> Paulloz: Set a cookie
[06:18:23] <Paulloz> but i want to clean some localStorage only if it's not a refresh
[06:18:24] <Eviltwin> Check and unset it on load
[06:18:31] <mantas322> :<
[06:18:48] <mantas322> unexpected illegal Token
[06:18:53] <mantas322> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[06:18:59] <mantas322> thanks for your help though guys
[06:19:00] <Eviltwin> Then you typo'd somewhere
[06:19:20] <mantas322> what kind of typo?
[06:19:37] <mantas322> I dont understand all it is is a link to another page and all the sudden is just errors
[06:19:40] <Anomareh> is there any way for me to store a pointer to an element in another element's data without using a ids or classes?
[06:19:41] <Eviltwin> Where you produced an illegal token
[06:19:50] <mantas322> ._.
[06:19:55] <mantas322> I wish I knew where i was doing that'
[06:19:58] <Eviltwin> Anomareh: see ?.data
[06:20:08] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[06:20:14] <Eviltwin> You can associate arbitrary data with that
[06:20:17] <Anomareh> Eviltwin: I'm currently using it, but how do I store a pointer to the element and not a copy?
[06:20:21] <nbari> how oes jquery/javascript interpret a returned 0 value vs 'false' or 1 vs true ?
[06:20:28] <nbari> should I return true or 1 ?
[06:20:33] <nbari> or false instead of 0 ?
[06:20:35] <Eviltwin> Elements are passed by reference
[06:20:47] <Paulloz> Eviltwin, thanks. it was so dump that i can't event think about it -_-
[06:20:48] <Eviltwin> nbari: 0 is false, every other real number is true
[06:21:02] <sadmicrowave> hi all
[06:21:08] <nbari> ok
[06:21:14] <Eviltwin> nbari: But there are boolean types
[06:21:16] <Eviltwin> true and false
[06:21:51] <is_null> hi all, how to append <div> before an element and </div> after it ?
[06:21:52] <nbari> for example from a php script the return i got is true/false how to tranlste that to javascript ?
[06:21:53] <Anomareh> Eviltwin: you sure? I have a child and a parent, I store the parent element in the child's data, then change the parent's data, and when I access the parent via the child's data the parent's data isn't updated
[06:22:08] <Eviltwin> nbari: Look at json_encode
[06:22:22] <is_null> apparently doing selector.before('<div>').after('</div>') places <div></div> before the selector
[06:22:28] <Eviltwin> Anomareh: Doesn't sound right. Can you make a jsFiddle example?
[06:22:29] <mantas322> another stupid question... and this probably wrong
[06:22:32] <Paulloz> is_null, use .appendTo(yourelement) on your div
[06:22:34] <Anomareh> Eviltwin: I'll try
[06:22:36] <Eviltwin> is_null: What' you think it did?
[06:22:40] <mantas322> but I have my $("<a>").attr("href", "http://www.google.com").text("Another j query link");      in <script type="text/javascript"> tags
[06:22:43] <is_null> Paulloz: ok thx
[06:22:49] <nbari> Eviltwin json_encode(true) returns a 1
[06:22:59] <Eviltwin> nbari: That's fine. It's "truthy"
[06:23:44] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, I'll give you $150 to write a script for me so I don't have to learn
[06:23:50] <Eviltwin> mantas322: The parser doesn't care about anything inside the <script> tag besides a </script>
[06:24:05] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: A script so you never have to learn?
[06:24:07] <Eviltwin> Sounds like a lot of work
[06:24:12] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:24:25] <mantas322> so how do i get this to appear on my page $("<a>").attr("href", "http://www.google.com").text("Another j query link");
[06:24:29] <mantas322> what is nessesary?
[06:24:43] <Eviltwin> insert it somewhere
[06:24:57] <nbari> ok now one second question, I am using the jquery validate plugin and using remote to querey a php script but when the script retuns a true, i got a 1 on the error message instead of the text specified on the messages
[06:25:01] <Eviltwin> Probably using either insertAfter, insertBefore or appendTo
[06:25:07] <sadmicrowave> mantas322, $('body').appned( 'your string or jquery element' );
[06:25:14] <sadmicrowave> .append*
[06:25:20] <Paulloz> mantas322, you've to append this element in an existing dom element
[06:25:34] <Eviltwin> $("<a>").attr("href", "http://www.google.com").text("Another j query link").appendTo("body"); for example
[06:26:42] <mantas322> thanks eviltwin, i'll trythat
[06:27:21] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: :P
[06:27:26] <sadmicrowave> ahh!
[06:27:43] <sadmicrowave> sup dude?
[06:28:05] <kborchers> not much. workin' (or at least acting like it) you?
[06:28:12] <Anomareh> Eviltwin: hrm I just made a fiddle and it's working, any idea what would cause me to get stale data?
[06:28:19] <mantas322> also thanks paulloz
[06:28:36] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, same here
[06:28:53] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: if Im doing validation for empty fields, and I only what the button to submit if all of the fields have content do i just use prevent default?
[06:29:27] <Iszak> jeffsmykil: preventDefault/return false
[06:29:32] <Eviltwin> Yes, preventDefault
[06:30:04] <jeffsmykil> return false also works ok
[06:30:13] <Eviltwin> But it also cancels bubbling
[06:32:04] <juboba> hello, I would like to do background transitions like in this web page : http://ayerviernes.com. Any ideas?
[06:32:39] <Eviltwin> juboba: Make a <div> or something that fills the screen and give it a low z-index
[06:33:25] <Paulloz> does someone know well how work window.localStorage ?
[06:34:14] <monk12> Just curious, do you guys all use the jquery-ui custom 'Build Your Download', or the full dev download which has all the .css/.js files for each componant in your prod builds?
[06:34:30] <jeffsmykil> custom
[06:34:37] <Paulloz> custom too
[06:34:38] <jeffsmykil> to many calls for the dev
[06:34:41] <jeffsmykil> too
[06:34:47] <juboba> Eviltwin, can I do the page transitions this way?
[06:34:59] <monk12> k thanks. guess i'll stick with that then.
[06:35:19] <sadmicrowave> oh my god I have an entire day of employee training seminars
[06:35:27] * sadmicrowave is asking anyone to shoot him in the head
[06:35:33] * Eviltwin steps up
[06:35:38] * Eviltwin aims
[06:35:39] * Eviltwin fires
[06:35:48] * sadmicrowave falls on the floor
[06:35:53] * sadmicrowave is bleeding out
[06:35:59] <gnarf> Eviltwin: yeah, i know you were on the ops list :)
[06:36:20] <gnarf> just thought you deserved a crown ;)
[06:36:54] <scratcha> guys this is doing my head in,, i wrote the following script which worked fine and for some reason has stopped working. see: http://pastie.org/3178466 note that line 8: alert IS displayed, yet the previous animation on line 7 does not happen ? any ideas?
[06:45:17] <kborchers> scratcha: can you create a fiddle? a static paste isn't very helpful in determining the cause of your issue
[06:48:01] <nisim777> hey all. i have a quick question, which I have searched on my own first, so hopefully you all are willing to help....
[06:48:32] <sadmicrowave> nisim777, go for it
[06:49:35] <nisim777> i'm trying to figure out how to pass a unique url to jquery's .load(). so, let's say I have a link that has a url based on the id in a table (product.php?id=$id). How can I get that link to .load() and load the page through the ajax call?
[06:50:47] <SixThreeOh> When using draggable with a helper, is it possible to ensure that the helped is actually created in the right place (such as inside of the container)?
[06:50:52] <scratcha> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/nyH3J/
[06:53:09] <SixThreeOh> ah appendTo
[06:53:37] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know of a good jQuert library for a rotator?  I'm looking for something like this: http://nursing.jhu.edu/ or http://test.nursing.virginia.edu/
[06:54:07] <jeffreylevesque> SixThreeOh: are you from NH???
[06:54:15] <jeffreylevesque> nvm lol
[06:54:26] <jeffreylevesque> that would be sixOhThree
[06:54:30] <jeffreylevesque> lol
[06:54:38] <mantas322> 630? the area code?
[06:54:49] <scratcha> nvm got it.
[06:55:13] <hatseflats> hi everyone
[06:55:38] <nisim777> i know the concept for my issue is $('#myBox a').click(function(){('#targetDiv').load('product.php?id=$id')}) but i cannot figure out how to get jquery to read the $id
[06:55:45] <snagnever> hey, has anyone ever used jqPlot?
[06:56:02] <kborchers> scratcha: out of curiosity, did you change it to animate background-position-x?
[06:56:38] <jeffreylevesque> any jquery library recommend for a slideshow?
[06:56:58] <scratcha> kborchers: i left out another script
[06:57:03] <jeffreylevesque> plugin rather*
[06:57:07] <mantas322> I litterally have one link on my page
[06:57:19] <mantas322> and it gives me unexpected token ILLEGAL
[06:57:20] <scratcha> :http://snook.ca/technical/jquery-bg/jquery.bgpos.js
[06:57:27] <hatseflats> anyone know if I can add a 'finally' setting to an ajax request, a function that will execute regardless of XHR success or failure?
[06:57:30] <jeffsmykil> do you think you could teach an octopus to paint?
[06:57:40] <EAN407> http://nivo.dev7studios.com/
[06:58:05] <hatseflats> I can see in the docs that a finally option doesn't exist, but is there some other property that does the same thing that I'm missing?
[06:58:06] <danzik17> hatseflats: it's called "complete".  or if using Deferreds in 1.6+, "always"
[06:58:13] <hatseflats> danzik17: thanks :)
[06:58:26] <hatseflats> aaahhh, there it is
[06:58:44] <EAN407> jeffreylevesque: the link was for you
[07:03:52] <Kingsy> anyone in here used the reel.js image rotate lib?
[07:04:19] <mantas322> could it be that the problem causing this illegal token exception is on the page that imtrying to go to instead of the paeg im trying to come from
[07:06:31] <jeffsmykil> does anyone know if i can load an aspx page via ajax and have it still post back?
[07:06:51] <mantas322> okay
[07:06:54] <mantas322> now we are getting somewhere
[07:07:55] <sailboat> Hello, is anyone available who would be willing to assist me with .getJson?
[07:10:14] <sailboat> can someone help me with the callback function for the .getJson function?
[07:12:22] <jeffsmykil> sailboat: justask
[07:13:04] <Flavius1924> how is this document.getElementById in jquery ?
[07:13:17] <sailboat> I am having issues getting the callback function to trigger, my code appears to be valid and when I query the server, I get a valid json return
[07:13:42] <jeffsmykil> sailboat are your parameters formatted corectly?
[07:13:50] <jeffsmykil> is it a service you are querying
[07:13:55] <sailboat> that I am not sure
[07:14:10] <sailboat> I am using a ODATA service to query
[07:14:40] <jeffsmykil> so you have to pass it parameters?
[07:14:41] <sailboat> I don't have parameters specified, i just placed everything in the url
[07:14:55] <sailboat> I placed a query that ended with $format=json
[07:15:17] <sailboat> (which to my knowledge is how the ODATA service is told to format json)
[07:15:18] <jeffsmykil> sailboat: the best thing you can do is provide sample code for the channel
[07:15:53] <sailboat> $.getJSON(qry, function (json) {
[07:16:02] <sailboat> alert("JSON Data: " + json.ActivityName);
[07:16:08] <jeffsmykil> Flavius1924: I don't understand your question
[07:16:10] <sailboat> });
[07:16:30] <Flavius1924> how do you get an element by id ?
[07:16:33] <Flavius1924> that's my question
[07:16:34] <sailboat> var qry = "<my site>/ODataService.svc/Activities?$filter=EventId eq 2&$format=json";
[07:16:42] <Eviltwin> $("#idgoeshere")
[07:16:50] <sailboat> unfortunately, I can't provide the site
[07:17:12] <Flavius1924> thanks!
[07:17:17] <sailboat> the query I know produces valid Json
[07:18:12] <lxsameer> jquery supposed to be a cross-browser framework, am i right?
[07:18:14] <sailboat> I apologize, I am quite new to web programming, could anyone recommend a good tool to debug the http gets and posts?
[07:18:23] <sailboat> yes it should
[07:18:27] <jeffsmykil> sailboat: fiddler
[07:19:12] <lxsameer> sailboat: firebug
[07:19:23] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: if i want the value of a dropdown after change do i have to put a set time out in?
[07:19:47] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: no
[07:20:07] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: wasnt sure when it fired
[07:20:57] <mantas322> WHY!
[07:21:13] <lxsameer> some of my codes did not run under chrome browser
[07:21:15] <mantas322> its saying my js function is undefined
[07:21:18] <mantas322> but it is SO defined!
[07:21:50] <jeffsmykil> lxsameer: is it ajax code?
[07:22:02] <Hooloovoork> mantas322: the most defined function like ever?!
[07:22:09] <lxsameer> jeffsmykil: no , just a simple show and hide thing
[07:22:13] <mantas322> Like TOTALLY
[07:22:21] <Hooloovoork> mantas322: OMG :O
[07:22:34] <Kingsy> AWESOME
[07:22:52] <sailboat> hahaha
[07:22:54] <sailboat> you guys
[07:22:57] <sailboat> :D
[07:23:53] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: sending a click through code?  $(#myelement).click?
[07:24:20] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: ??? you mean .click()?
[07:24:30] <kborchers> also quotes around your id
[07:24:38] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[07:24:43] <jeffsmykil> just wondering if it was click
[07:24:47] <kborchers> yes
[07:24:51] <sailboat> are you guys using a script to reply to people, or is there a built in command a newbie like me doesn't know?
[07:24:59] <sailboat> (the whole name :
[07:24:59] <jeffsmykil>   $("#MainContent_CurrentSurgeriesButton").click();
[07:25:00] <sailboat> )
[07:25:02] <jeffsmykil> is what i have
[07:25:16] <kborchers> sailboat: start typing a name and hit tab
[07:25:46] <mantas322> someone here helped me with something here yesterday
[07:25:52] <mantas322> and I overwrote it
[07:26:02] <Eviltwin> I suggest keeping chat logs next time
[07:26:09] <mantas322> my question was how to NOT reload the page after input submit has been clicked
[07:26:21] <mantas322> i know im sorry
[07:26:24] <kborchers> mantas322: This channel is publicly logged to http://irc.jquery.com
[07:26:26] <mantas322> it was event.ignore()
[07:26:30] <mantas322> :O
[07:26:34] <cybersholt> event.preventDefault(); works
[07:26:41] <Hooloovoork> kborchers: Oh noes! not logged!
[07:26:55] <mantas322> thanks cybersholt
[07:27:02] <Eviltwin> I WASN'T NOTIFIED THAT I WAS BEING RECORDED! I'M SUING!
[07:27:07] <cybersholt> no problem mantas322
[07:27:12] <mantas322> oh and kborchers I'd rather not know about things like this
[07:27:15] <kborchers> yes you were ... it's in the topic
[07:27:16] <Hooloovoork> class action lawsuit coming up!
[07:27:18] <cybersholt> lmao Evil
[07:27:19] <mantas322> I hate my internet footprint
[07:27:28] <sailboat> my client doesn't seem to let me do that (im using bersirc)
[07:27:50] <sailboat> 2.2.14
[07:27:50] <kborchers> sailboat: u on a mac?
[07:27:54] <sailboat> lol no
[07:28:03] <Hooloovoork> sailboat: u on a boat?
[07:28:06] <sailboat> you bet
[07:28:12] <Eviltwin> Looks like Bersirc v2.2.14 on Windows
[07:28:12] <Hooloovoork> \o/
[07:28:25] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: do you know if you can send clicks to hidden elements?
[07:28:30] <cybersholt> is that client any good?
[07:28:35] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Yes, you can
[07:28:40] <jeffsmykil> awesome
[07:28:50] <sailboat> it's simple and free, I like it so far, however I'd like to be able to reply like you pros
[07:29:09] <kborchers> Looks like this is the point in the day where I stop responding and let Eviltwin take over :P
[07:29:24] <Hooloovoork> sailboat: get irssi or something
[07:29:26] <Eviltwin> Ha ha
[07:29:29] <sailboat> okies
[07:29:45] <sailboat> yeah I was sick of mIRC, it acted wierd and always wants me to buy it.
[07:30:29] <sailboat> at least this is a step up from bitchx console
[07:30:36] <anjen> on a realted note, when I've used $('#some_element').click()?, the reponse seems pretty slow, on the order of 2-3 seconds before the action occurs. Is there something I'm failing to do?
[07:30:41] <anjen> *related
[07:30:44] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: apologies
[07:30:57] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: for what?
[07:31:00] <k4m4n> how is that jquery can make javascript functions or commands look so smooth like flash?
[07:31:08] <Hooloovoork> sailboat: bitchx is awesome. it's only beaten by irssi =P
[07:31:13] <k4m4n> does jquery itsself use javascript?
[07:31:25] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: asking you so many questions
[07:31:25] <pifantastic> wat
[07:31:27] <Hooloovoork> k4m4n: lol =D
[07:31:27] <sailboat> I have yet to use anything but the console
[07:31:29] <Eviltwin> k4m4n: Yes...jQuery uses JavaScript...
[07:31:31] <Hooloovoork> k4m4n: yes
[07:31:34] <sailboat> it's perdy too (I use it when I ssh)
[07:31:48] <k4m4n> so why can't you do exactly what you query with jquery with javascript?
[07:31:49] <polygonpusher> how would I select the first p of a div with an class of "test"  $('.test p')[0] ?
[07:31:51] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: no prob ... that's why we're all here. to ask and answer questions
[07:31:52] <k4m4n> whats all the hype about it?
[07:31:54] <sailboat> my server is too lame to forward xwindows over my connection
[07:32:03] <Hooloovoork> k4m4n: what do you mean?
[07:32:09] <Eviltwin> k4m4n: Have you ever heard of something called "Frameworks"?
[07:32:19] <anjen> k4m4n: Jquery makes it easier, since much of the javascript is simplified
[07:32:35] <kunglao> jquery rules:D
[07:32:38] <k4m4n> so the whole point is... instead of one righting it out... its already there?
[07:32:38] <Eviltwin> k4m4n: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework
[07:33:08] <Eviltwin> k4m4n: That's the idea, yes
[07:33:14] <anjen> k4m4n: no, not all, just some of it. you still need to write javascript, it's jsut that Jquery handles some of the complexity
[07:33:40] <sailboat> wow, totally installing this on my server
[07:33:50] <cybersholt> just downloaded  bersirc and it says (SASL access only) when i try to connect
[07:33:57] <Hooloovoork> k4m4n: jquery tries to put a wrapper around stuff that's boring and tricky to so, so you can focus on the javascript part and not the DOM api.
[07:34:10] <k4m4n> Hooloovoork: i got it
[07:34:15] <k4m4n> thx
[07:34:30] <k4m4n> another question when loading the jquery... if i download the file
[07:34:38] <Eviltwin> Well really so you can focus on what you're trying to do with it and not the nitty gritty details
[07:34:39] <k4m4n> is it again connecting to somwehre elese
[07:34:42] <Eviltwin> Of how
[07:34:50] <k4m4n> havevn't really looked at the jquery code
[07:34:57] <Eviltwin> Have you done much JavaScript before?
[07:35:05] <k4m4n> somewhat yes
[07:35:12] <Hooloovoork> k4m4n: jquery does not make any connections if you don't use ajax.
[07:35:15] <Eviltwin> So you know about <script src="..."></script> etc.
[07:35:29] <Eviltwin> You just include jQuery that way
[07:35:35] <Eviltwin> And then use it
[07:35:47] <k4m4n> Eviltwin: like i told you haven't looked at the code
[07:35:57] <Eviltwin> You shouldn't have to...
[07:36:02] <k4m4n> just getting an idea of it
[07:36:08] <Eviltwin> And unless you understand advanced JavaScript, you'll likely be very confused if you do
[07:36:42] <k4m4n> so it only makes connection on ajax?
[07:36:59] <k4m4n> specific functions and call ups?
[07:37:05] <Eviltwin> Including it won't cause any additional requests unless you tell it to make additional requests
[07:37:29] <Hooloovoork> maybe i shouldn't have said that part about ajax. i have no idea if that was what you asked... =P
[07:37:36] <k4m4n> so on ajax where does it connect to... i am guessing that for chatting system
[07:37:41] <anjen> the only other time it requires a connection is if you use a remote url to load the script(s)
[07:37:48] <Eviltwin> ...
[07:37:49] <Hooloovoork> k4m4n: it connects to wherever you want it to.
[07:38:01] <Eviltwin> k4m4n: Have you done AJAX in JavaScript before?
[07:38:11] <Eviltwin> Does XmlHttpRequest ring a bell?
[07:38:14] <k4m4n> nope
[07:38:21] <Eviltwin> Then forget about it for now
[07:38:28] <Eviltwin> It shouldn't concern you
[07:38:39] <Eviltwin> You can learn more about it later
[07:38:44] <Eviltwin> But it's not critical to understanding jQuery
[07:39:07] <Hooloovoork> it's really insanely uncritical to learning jquery
[07:39:09] <k4m4n> Eviltwin: i got it... just wondering about security issues that all
[07:39:39] <Eviltwin> It's not a security issue if you don't use it and it's not really a security issue if you do
[07:39:40] <k4m4n> the last thing i want is call up something and its making connections elsewhere
[07:39:44] <Eviltwin> So don't worry about it for now
[07:39:59] <mantas322> i'll give u a security issue.
[07:40:39] <EAN407> does a trick exist where i can use the click event also on a draggable?
[07:40:41] <k4m4n> so a simple example of picture gallery using jquery... abviously just uses the code specified in file... no connection attemps correct?
[07:41:06] <polygonpusher> need help getting text from the first index of jQuery(".testimonial p")[0].text() come back as method not found
[07:41:09] <Eviltwin> k4m4n:
[07:41:12] <sailboat_irssi> this client is baller
[07:41:24] <Eviltwin> polygonpusher: .eq(0) instead of [0]
[07:41:27] <Eviltwin> k4m4n: No
[07:41:32] <polygonpusher> thanks
[07:41:52] <k4m4n> Eviltwin: spank you sir, you should be called Goodtwin ;)
[07:42:42] <jeffsmykil> I dont suppose there is a way to do array[last]
[07:43:03] <danzik171> jeffsmykil: array[ array.length - 1 ]
[07:43:13] <jeffsmykil> ah clever
[07:43:14] <byebyebyezzz> I have 4 <div> overlap each other. I am trying to use z-index to show them one by one but it doesnt seem to work
[07:43:15] <jeffsmykil> i like it
[07:43:39] <cybersholt> has anybody in here used Kinetic JS?
[07:44:08] <mantas322> for some reason
[07:44:23] <webb> hi all , .post() crossdomain?
[07:44:26] <mantas322> including jQuery makes my page load EXTREMELY slow on mobile devices
[07:44:29] <Eviltwin> webb: No
[07:44:32] <mantas322> this makes me a littly worrysome
[07:44:44] <yuka> then your code is badly optimized mantas322
[07:44:45] <yuka> :)
[07:44:55] <mantas322> no its fine
[07:44:56] <Eviltwin> mantas322: Are you including the minified version?
[07:45:01] <sailboat> mantas322: have you considered jquere mobile?
[07:45:02] <webb> Eviltwin: any other way?
[07:45:04] <mantas322> maybe im not
[07:45:09] <Eviltwin> webb: A cross-domain POST?
[07:45:18] <webb> yes.
[07:45:19] <mantas322> thats a good question eviltwin and sailbot
[07:45:27] <Eviltwin> webb: Not going to happen
[07:45:37] <Eviltwin> It violates SOP
[07:45:42] <Eviltwin> ?w Same-origin policy
[07:45:47] <sailboat> mantas322: I'm currently working with MVC 4 and jquery mobile to design a mobile website
[07:45:56] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[07:45:57] <Eviltwin> webb: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[07:45:57] <sailboat> mantas322: jquery mobile is incredible
[07:46:09] <mantas322> thats what im using i think
[07:46:18] <sailboat> mantas322: im not the biggest fan of microsoft technology, but I do love HTML5
[07:46:26] <Eviltwin> ...
[07:46:28] <mantas322> <script src="js/jquery-1.6.3.min.js"></script>           <script src="js/jquery.mobile-1.0b3.min.js"></script>
[07:46:32] <sailboat> mantas322: (speaking in terms of MVC)
[07:46:38] <Eviltwin> You think HTML5 is a Microsoft technology?
[07:46:40] <sailboat> no i don't
[07:46:44] <sailboat> lol I know thats how it came off
[07:46:49] <sailboat> but MVC4 actually uses HTML 5
[07:46:56] <Hooloovoork> how's jquery mobile coming along btw? has it taken off?
[07:46:57] <anjen> byebyebyezzz: is your positioning set? read this (there are others, it's just the first one that popped off in google search)
[07:47:05] <cybersholt> sailboat have u tried a manifest? that will cache whatever one the device 4 ya
[07:47:09] <anjen> byebyebyezzz: http://divitodesign.com/css/z-index-overlap-html-elements-with-css/
[07:47:32] <mantas322> I dont understand where all this slowness is comming from
[07:47:37] <mantas322> PC browsers act the same way
[07:47:38] <sailboat> cybersholt: unfortunately, the design isn't up to me, and no.  I'll check it out right now :D
[07:47:52] <mantas322> mobile devices sit there for like 40 seconds or so before displaying my page
[07:48:04] <cybersholt> all right its worth doing saves going out everytime to get the files
[07:48:12] <danzik171> mantas322: all of them, or only certain ones?
[07:48:12] <Hooloovoork> mantas322: to a profiling in chromium
[07:48:17] <Hooloovoork> do*
[07:48:20] <anjen> mantas, what kind of resources iis it loading? images by any chance?
[07:48:20] <sailboat> mantas322: are you doing most of the processing on the device or the server?
[07:48:54] <mantas322> Im doing processing on the server I guess
[07:49:04] <mantas322> I have alot of regex replaces going on but thats it
[07:49:12] <mantas322> but those r done on the coldfusion end
[07:49:31] <mantas322> w/o jQuery it works fine on mobile devices with it its slow
[07:49:35] <jeffsmykil> is split() case sensitive?
[07:49:43] <mantas322> whats chromium
[07:49:56] <Hooloovoork> mantas322: chrome
[07:50:04] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: If you're using a string, yes
[07:50:11] <Eviltwin> You can use a case-insensitive regex if you want
[07:50:21] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: ty
[07:50:26] <gyzmodo> guys
[07:50:35] <Hooloovoork> gyzmodo: guy
[07:50:56] <gyzmodo> how can i get .box1 divs height and put this height to .box2
[07:51:01] <mantas322> i've never used this part of the dev tools before
[07:51:09] <mantas322> thanks for the suggestion I'll play around with it
[07:51:18] <Eviltwin> $(".box2").css("height", $(".box1").height()) ?
[07:51:43] <Hooloovoork> gyzmodo: $(".box2").css("height", $(".box1").height());
[07:51:47] <Hooloovoork> awww
[07:51:48] <Hooloovoork> i lost
[07:52:06] <gyzmodo> .box1's height dynamic
[07:52:08] <equivoc> you all three lose
[07:52:22] <Hooloovoork> gyzmodo: then it'll be tricky
[07:52:24] <Eviltwin> You mean so it always exactly matches?
[07:52:26] <equivoc> with this quere ".box2"
[07:52:29] <equivoc> *query
[07:52:31] <mantas322> anjen   YES
[07:52:34] <mantas322> ALOT of images
[07:52:43] <polygonpusher> so I have got a object via $(".someclass").eq(0); how would I then get all the p's from that? I tired $(".someclass").eq(0).$("p") but no luck
[07:53:06] <Hooloovoork> anyways, going home!
[07:53:12] <gyzmodo> any ideas?
[07:53:42] <anjen> mantas, if you happen to be scaling larger images to fit a mobile device, you're probably just running into filesize problems. I had to add a new image size to my paperclip routine to recude their footprint for mobile use
[07:53:47] <anjen> *reduce
[07:54:03] <mantas322> no, no scaling is happening
[07:54:06] <mantas322> unless it automatic
[07:54:09] <mantas322> WHIOCH IT COULD BE
[07:54:11] <mantas322> oh my
[07:54:13] <anjen> mantas322: that is, loading a 1024x768 image is jsut going to take a long time on mobile
[07:54:15] <mantas322> u might be onto something
[07:54:22] <anjen> yah
[07:54:28] <mantas322> im loading a buncha 80 x 80 thumbnails
[07:54:37] <mantas322> and then their equvelents
[07:54:43] <anjen> << works for a real estate imaging service. yes. it's a problem
[07:54:48] <mantas322> typically around 400 by 5000 varies
[07:54:55] <anjen> 80x80 is no issue, it's what they link to
[07:55:20] <anjen> those 400x5K images are huge
[07:55:29] <mantas322> why would it matter what they link to?
[07:55:46] <anjen> I'm sorry, what I meant is if the full sized images are being preloaded
[07:56:13] <mantas322> no
[07:56:16] <mantas322> so
[07:56:27] <anjen> if you're jsut loading thumbnails, it should not be a problem, although you can expect load delays when a full sizee is loaded
[07:56:34] <mantas322> you think that jquery mobile likes to resize images to optimize them for a mobile device?
[07:56:44] <anjen> no
[07:56:51] <NoiseEee> mantas322: you think thats maybe something YOU should control?
[07:56:59] <mantas322> I do
[07:57:08] <mantas322> Im just wondering if jquery is doing something on its own
[07:57:12] <sailboat> I forgot who recommended me irssi, but it's amazing, thanks :D
[07:57:22] <mantas322> images arnt larger then 500 by 600 or so
[07:57:22] <anjen> mantas322: to laod an image optimzed for mobile viewing, you'll need to preprocess the image
[07:57:38] <mantas322> I DONT want to do that
[07:57:43] <mantas322> I just wanna show them as is
[07:57:54] <jeffsmykil> less work
[07:58:00] <jeffsmykil> make them a sprite!
[07:58:11] <jeffsmykil> that should improve load times lol
[07:58:24] <anjen> then you need a faster device or deal with load times, especially if you're loading lots of images. It's jsut the nature of the beast
[07:58:28] <mantas322> isnt a sprite just a 2d image?
[07:58:57] <NoiseEee> mantas322: the answer is always to have thumbnails/alternative image sizes generated on the server, at upload time, ready to be delivered on command
[07:59:03] <jeffsmykil> all yor images in one image
[07:59:05] <jeffsmykil> then you pan around
[07:59:09] <jeffsmykil> less image calls
[07:59:13] <jeffsmykil> potentially less size
[07:59:22] <sailboat> jeffsmykil: is that hard to implement?
[07:59:30] <jeffsmykil> it can be a pita
[07:59:57] <mantas322> hmmm
[08:00:01] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin, yeah, .box2's height alway same as .box1's height
[08:00:17] <jeffsmykil> im not suggesting using a sprite for 4500 images i was kidding
[08:00:22] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: What's the usecase?
[08:01:18] <anjen> mantas322: think of it this way, a 3G connection (pretty standard) is far slower than most wired connections. You have to compensate for the sluggishness somehow, either by coping with slower loads or reducing the footprint of the loaded content
[08:01:52] <mantas322> I understand this completely
[08:02:04] <mantas322> and my mobile devices im testing with are on the wifi
[08:02:09] <mantas322> my issue is
[08:02:24] <mantas322> if I dont includwe the jquery.js everything loads in under a second
[08:02:29] <cybersholt> im on 3g and its not really the size its multiple files with high rtt
[08:02:34] <mantas322> with js takes up to a minutes
[08:02:34] <anjen> hmm...
[08:02:51] <Eviltwin> mantas322: Sounds like you need a better CDN
[08:02:53] <jeffsmykil> mantas can we see this page
[08:03:05] <mantas322> no sorry
[08:03:24] <NoiseEee> mantas322: and your images aren't going through some sort of jquery plugin/function call?
[08:03:24] <mantas322> and another page I have, loads fast too
[08:03:25] <anjen> well, one thing I do knwo is that $(element).click(); is very slow, at least in my experience
[08:03:30] <mantas322> no
[08:03:38] <mantas322> but theres parsing happening
[08:03:43] <mantas322> that  could be it
[08:03:53] <mantas322> I dont think the images are hats causing the issue'
[08:04:06] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin, i am using jscrollpanel
[08:04:10] <anjen> right, not if they laod quickly using direct js control
[08:04:26] <gyzmodo> is it so hard in jQuery?
[08:04:46] <polygonpusher> having issues with a nested selectors please show me what I'm doing wrong. http://jsfiddle.net/45rpj/2/
[08:05:06] <Eviltwin> polygonpusher: You have syntax errors with that
[08:05:09] <Eviltwin> Please try again
[08:05:28] <Eviltwin> Hint: The number of quotes should be even
[08:05:39] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: how did that load so fast for you?
[08:05:46] <jeffsmykil> jsfiddle is so slow to load for me
[08:05:49] <Eviltwin> I'm on a University connection
[08:06:00] <mantas322> oh my
[08:06:17] <mantas322> its my coldfusion parsing
[08:06:29] <Eviltwin> Eww
[08:06:32] <Eviltwin> ColdFusion?
[08:06:34] <mantas322> while including mobilejquery.js
[08:06:39] <Eviltwin> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1704965656.png
[08:06:41] <cybersholt> people still use that?
[08:06:42] <mantas322> Yeah I know eviltwin I agree 100%   XD
[08:06:59] <mantas322> so coldfusion doesnt play nice with jquery mobile
[08:07:00] <jeffsmykil> lmao people still use cold fusion?!
[08:07:01] <mantas322> believe that!
[08:07:14] <jeffsmykil> are you sent here from the past?
[08:07:19] <jeffsmykil> sent to learn our secrets
[08:07:23] <polygonpusher> sorry about that fixed http://jsfiddle.net/45rpj/4/
[08:07:27] <mantas322> probably
[08:07:31] <polygonpusher> but still no good
[08:07:32] <anjen> cold fusion is still used quite a bit for embedded work afaik
[08:07:38] <mantas322> enough, dont hurt my coldfusion feelings anymore
[08:07:43] <Eviltwin> polygonpusher: Please read this page: http://api.jquery.com/find/
[08:07:50] <jeffsmykil> anjen: example?
[08:07:52] <polygonpusher> thanks
[08:08:40] <anjen> Um, well, a whole bunch of data aquistion tools
[08:08:52] <anjen> not web but devices
[08:09:39] <anjen> you generally don't place jquery onto an oscilloscope or dmm
[08:10:52] <polygonpusher> thanks for the help Eviltwin
[08:11:04] <Soopaman> are there any javascript pattern/anti pattern tutorials books or examples available?
[08:11:29] <sailboat> Eviltwin: I just saw your speedtest, i hate you
[08:11:52] <Soopaman> trying to figure out a better way to deal with stacks and recursion
[08:12:01] <Eviltwin> Soopaman: Have you seen Eloquent JavaScript?
[08:12:21] <Eviltwin> http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[08:12:23] <Eviltwin> I'd start there
[08:12:44] <kborchers> Soopaman: I would second that. that is a great book
[08:13:06] <Soopaman> it's been a while since I've read it, but it looks like it was updated
[08:13:13] <Soopaman> lemme refresh myself
[08:13:18] <gyzmodo> so how can i get .box1's height?
[08:13:25] <Soopaman> thanks
[08:13:27] <jeffsmykil> javascript is easier when you can spell selector names correctly
[08:14:04] <anjen> $('.box1').css('height'); ?
[08:14:13] <gyzmodo> are you asking me/
[08:14:16] <gyzmodo> anjen?
[08:14:45] <anjen> gyzmodo erm var box_height = $('.box1').css('height');
[08:15:14] <mantas322> not even the regex replaces causing the issue
[08:15:32] <gnarf> anjen: why not just .height() ? :)
[08:15:33] <mantas322> just querying the DB and outputting a value is enough to HALT this operation to a crawl
[08:15:40] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/height
[08:15:52] <anjen> gnarf, maybe becuase I'm still not expert ;)
[08:16:22] <mantas322> maybe I should use javascript and document.write or something
[08:16:27] <gyzmodo> gnarf, help me :)
[08:16:28] <ritztech> im using 2 seperate jquery builds on 1 page and i cant seem to get BOTH to work ..... but when i take out the line <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>    ONE of the checkboxes works (as it shows the nice little graphic spin to it)
[08:16:51] <NoiseEee> mantas322: congrats on the troll of the week, you had me confused for a bit
[08:17:19] <Eviltwin> ritztech: Why are you using two separate jQuery builds?
[08:17:32] <NoiseEee> non-stop programming non sequiturs
[08:17:36] <mantas322> what im trollin cause im using coldfusion?
[08:17:50] <ritztech> im using http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/       AND    http://tutorialzine.com/2011/03/better-check-boxes-jquery-css/ on the same page
[08:17:58] <anjen> gnarf, thanks btw. Just learned something new. nice...
[08:18:18] <ritztech> well im trying to get 2 seperate button styles to load on the same page and i think i have conflicts lol
[08:18:21] <byebyebyezzz> I have 1 <div> with z-index: 9 and the other with z-index10. They on top of each other. However I still see the content from both <div> over lap each other. Is there a way for me to just show the content in the div I want?
[08:18:55] <ritztech> well im not sure if there 2 seperate but they are 2 seperate button styles
[08:19:38] <alexr2> byebyebyezzz style="display: none"
[08:19:39] <anjen> byebyebyezzz: are they positioned directly atop one another?
[08:20:00] <Flavius1924> can you tell me how can i do this ? i want a text to be shown only if i press another text http://jsfiddle.net/Aqy9E/
[08:20:03] <byebyebyezzz> ty
[08:20:29] <EdwardIII> hey
[08:22:02] <alexr2> Flavius1924 are you using jquery or mootools?
[08:22:03] <EdwardIII> not sure how well this would translate to jsfiddle so linking directly: http://edwardiii.co.uk/scratch.html
[08:22:22] <alexr2> or neither?
[08:22:25] <EdwardIII> any idea how i could make this more friendly for someone with < 600px high?
[08:22:40] <kborchers> Flavius1924: I don't mean to be rude but we aren't here to write your code for you  (I get paid to do that). At least make an attempt before asking for help. You may just figure it out yourself.
[08:22:48] <Flavius1924> alexr2,there is selected mootools
[08:22:51] <EdwardIII> a user with less vertical space loses the 'Some action to do with the widgets above' link
[08:23:20] <alexr2> can't help you with mootools, never used the library
[08:23:32] <Flavius1924> ok,but i want jquery
[08:23:35] <alexr2> it's easy enough with regular javascript though
[08:23:49] <Flavius1924> let me one second to see how can i change the library on jsfiddle
[08:23:51] <mantas322> okay okay.... one last plausable clause for all this lagg im seeing
[08:23:59] <mantas322> the data from the database is in XML
[08:25:00] <Eviltwin> Flavius1924: http://jsfiddle.net/Aqy9E/5/
[08:25:02] <mantas322> maybe if your dumping xml WITH a jQuery.js file     it struggles laying everythign out, on a mobile device
[08:25:09] <Eviltwin> That's your free taste
[08:25:10] <Flavius1924> look.i have this but i don't want any buttons
[08:25:12] <Eviltwin> Anything more is going to cost you
[08:25:16] <Flavius1924> i want instead of a button to be a text
[08:25:54] <EdwardIII> why not turn your attention to my delightfully cute conundrum
[08:25:56] <alexr2> Flavius1924, that can really easily be done with regular old javascript, you should read up on it a little bit
[08:26:20] <pringlescan> Eviltwin, I was suffering from code exhaustion last night, there were so many mistakes I don't even know how my code "worked" in my mind. You were also right that there's no need to pass the words, we'll always be able to match the searched keywords on presentation since we know what they are...
[08:26:35] <Flavius1924> yes,i figured it out .thanks Eviltwin and all you,guys.i'm lazy,i admit it :)
[08:26:48] <Eviltwin> pringlescan: Glad you figure it out because I sure had no idea what was going on :P
[08:26:54] <black_warlock> is this right ?>>>> $("#qq").change(function() {
[08:26:55] <black_warlock> 	var searchvalue = $(this).val ; alert(searchvalue);
[08:27:08] <Eviltwin> Nope
[08:27:28] <pringlescan> It's down to 55 lines of code, going to make your suggested change of not using = {} for the keyword_indexes, I think it'll be a lot easier to debug now, I commented everything and made it readable.
[08:27:43] <Eviltwin> If you're accessing a non-integer property of a jQuery object and not running it as a function, you're probably doing something wrong
[08:27:45] <EdwardIII> actually, i've got an idea
[08:27:49] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: ^
[08:28:23] <black_warlock> so must be #qq . val ?
[08:28:34] <alexr2> black_warlock, $(this).val()
[08:28:40] <alexr2> val is a method
[08:28:43] <black_warlock> ah
[08:29:01] <black_warlock> infact it was popping the entire function val
[08:29:05] <black_warlock> lol
[08:29:09] <NoiseEee> mantas322: understand that mobile devices have far, far less power than any desktop or laptop equivalent.  processing left to the client will take MUCH longer.  and of course "without jquery" stuff loads quickly, because your JS is broken (no jquery) and therefore nothing to iterate through (just errors and moves on)
[08:30:04] <mantas322> Thank you for your insight NoiseEee
[08:30:09] <gyzmodo> http://jsfiddle.net/dEevJ/
[08:30:17] <mantas322> im only using jQuery for the header , and 1 back button
[08:30:19] <NoiseEee> if your next comment is about coldfusion, xml, or a database, i will electrocute you
[08:30:21] <gyzmodo> what's wrong with this code?
[08:30:27] <mantas322> lol
[08:30:37] <mantas322> okay okay, i'll stop thinking outload in this chat
[08:30:50] <mantas322> or at least minimize my annoyance here :>
[08:32:26] <anjen> gyzmodo, if your intention is to set the height of the second div, then why not just do $(the div to be controlled).css(height1); ?
[08:32:51] <anjen> *erm, css('height', height1);
[08:33:13] <Eviltwin> .height is also a setter
[08:33:16] <Eviltwin> .height(height1)
[08:33:20] <anjen> oh. sorry
[08:33:23] <alexr2> gyzmodo getElementById doesn't need the # sign
[08:33:23] <anjen> yeah
[08:33:31] <alexr2> it's document.getElementById("test")
[08:33:36] <alexr2> not ("#test")
[08:34:28] <Eviltwin> This can all be done: http://jsfiddle.net/dEevJ/1/
[08:34:59] <Eviltwin> Note this won't adjust if they resize
[08:35:01] <polygonpusher> can you make a var from a $ selection and then edit that selection but have a the var reference keep the original value?
[08:35:16] <Eviltwin> I suggest you look at http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/
[08:35:22] <Eviltwin> pringlescan: Yup
[08:35:28] <Eviltwin> Well
[08:35:36] <Eviltwin> If I understood correctly what you meant, then yes
[08:36:00] <Eviltwin> var foo = $(".foo"); foo.removeClass("foo"); foo.addClass("bar");
[08:36:12] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin, OMG
[08:36:15] <Eviltwin> Everything that has class "foo" no longer has class "foo" and instead has class "bar"
[08:36:20] <gyzmodo> red box too large
[08:36:22] <gyzmodo> why?
[08:36:29] <Eviltwin> What?
[08:36:55] <gyzmodo> grey box's height is 200px
[08:37:03] <EdwardIII> OK - i've tried making a tweak based on not scrolling if the bottom of element is lower than the height of the window: http://edwardiii.co.uk/scratch.html
[08:37:16] <EdwardIII> but then the scrolling pink widget box can get lost at the bottom
[08:37:22] <EdwardIII> any pointers would be great!#
[08:38:38] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin, did you see?
[08:38:45] <polygonpusher> its more like: var foo = $(".foo"); $(".foo").text("blaaa 2"); console.log( $(foo).text); // echos blaa 2 not blaaa 1 which as original.
[08:38:47] <EdwardIII> in fact all you need to do is scroll up quick and it gets lost
[08:38:49] <xmaddness> for the selector is a jquery [attribute=value], does the value have to be enclosed in double quotes?
[08:39:01] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: It looks perfectly fine to me
[08:39:18] <Eviltwin> pringlescan: Uh...why?
[08:39:34] <gyzmodo> which browser?
[08:39:34] <polygonpusher> is that cause foo is holding the method its self vs. the return value?
[08:39:49] <Eviltwin> var foo = $(".foo").text(); $(".foo").text("blaaa 2"); console.log(foo)
[08:40:56] <pringlescan> what's the best way to initialize a bunch of empty arrays at once… var arr1 = arr2 = arr3 = arr4 = arr5 = []; ?
[08:41:26] <Eviltwin> Those will all be empty but will also point to the same array
[08:41:30] <gnarf> pringlescan: thats all the same array
[08:41:47] <Eviltwin> var arr1 = [], arr2 = [], arr3 = [], arr4 = [], arr5 = [];
[08:42:11] <gnarf> xmaddness: double or single quote, yes
[08:42:26] <gnarf> xmaddness: and that is per CSS specification
[08:42:52] <xmaddness> gnarf, okay thanks. yeah this is actually a selector being grabbed via selenium, so I am wondering if selenium can handle that or not
[08:43:12] <pringlescan> I keep forgetting that JS is by reference, I'd rather it that way but I need to be very careful.
[08:43:15] <pringlescan> thanks
[08:43:46] <pringlescan> I'm going to read 3 or 4 books but I can't do so before my Tuesday release :-) I'm the kind of person to go back and re-write n00b crap code when nobody is looking though.
[08:44:45] <EdwardIII> refactoring is pretty a vital exercise
[08:44:48] <EdwardIII> which books did you read?
[08:45:51] <EdwardIII> oh hey, managed to jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/
[08:46:01] <EdwardIII> er, that's not righ
[08:46:13] <EdwardIII> oh great, save button isn't working
[08:46:24] <EdwardIII> ........there we go: http://jsfiddle.net/6j8an/
[08:47:11] <pringlescan> I haven't read anything yet, I have jQuery from Novice to Ninja. I've started reading Javascript: The Good Parts and I have Javascript The Definitive Guide (6th edition), High Performance JavaScript
[08:47:37] <pringlescan> ***I haven't read much of anything
[08:47:58] <EdwardIII> cool - done much programming?
[08:47:58] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: What is this supposed to do?
[08:48:36] <christophler> Hello #jquery.. Ive been coding with js/etc for like 10 years, and for some reason, today im finding it impossible to download the parts I require for something. I have latest version of Jquery from Google CDN, then I want tooltip, but I need position? which is now in jqueryUI?
[08:48:39] <byebyebyezzz> I am trying to get a Jumb function for my powerpoint. right now I save the address of the first page and I use .next() x number of time through a loop. I was just wondering if there is a faster and more efficient way to do it
[08:48:48] <pringlescan> well that's a lie, probably 1/5 of JS the Good Parts, and almost all of Jquery from Novice to Ninja… I've been programming 15 years but I have tons of bad habbits from working solo.
[08:48:49] <EdwardIII> Eviltwin: the blue area is meant to follow you down the page...... but only if there's actually room to do so, for example if the visitor is a small vertical viewing area they can easily scroll the 'Some actions...' link out of existence
[08:51:18] <kborchers> christophler: what is your issue? what can't you download? could you explain further what the issue is?
[08:53:07] <EdwardIII> pringlescan: JS is a really cool language
[08:53:22] <christophler> kborchers: Im just trying to use JQuery Tooltip, Ive used it before.. I did use jqueryTools CDN, but their tooltip is... not reliable, so Im just trying to get the right components for tooltip for jquery... For some reason the websites have become opaque to me.
[08:53:42] <kborchers> jquery tools sucks ... that's the issue
[08:53:51] <christophler> kborchers: it says that jquery tooltip depends on position plugin.. but the position plugin It appears, is now part of the jqueryUI kit?
[08:53:58] <christophler> kborchers: I discovered that :)
[08:54:00] <christophler> nice idea though
[08:54:10] <christophler> what about a Jquery CDN, thats what I was lokoing for really
[08:54:18] <kborchers> for UI?
[08:54:28] <christophler> I dont know, I just want tooltip to work
[08:54:42] <EdwardIII> Eviltwin: if i remove my idea it works better, but still doesn't resolve the issue of smaller viewports: http://jsfiddle.net/6j8an/1/
[08:54:58] <kborchers> what tooltip? one you have built or a plugin?
[08:55:04] <christophler> jquery.tooltip plugin
[08:55:17] <christophler> straight up standard Jquery Tooltip plugin
[08:55:45] <kborchers> hmmm ... i have not used that. do you have a link to its docs?
[08:56:09] <christophler> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Tooltip
[08:56:12] <christophler> :?
[08:56:46] <christophler> Hmm im going to look at my source from my last project (about a year ago)... I just expected it to be very obvious the steps to take
[08:58:54] <kborchers> christophler: i would look here http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/
[08:59:01] <kborchers> that is the main page for that plugin
[08:59:19] <kborchers> his demos still work so you can probably use that to get you going
[08:59:33] <chrisinajar> I have a page with a menu system. The menu system uses the .mouseblah functions to handle the expansion of the submenus. At the office, it works perfectly on everyone's computer except for one. It's IE8, though it works fine on other IE8 installs, and what happens is that at the bottom of the screen it says it has 7 items remaining to download and the menu doesn't start working until they're loaded
[08:59:40] <EdwardIII> Eviltwin: ... i guess what i want is "scroll down up to a maximum of x"
[09:00:26] <chrisinajar> To test this, i created a URL that would never finish loading (netcat -l -p 80) and on my computer i now get 1 item remaining, but the menu works fine while it's loading
[09:00:37] <chrisinajar> any troublshooting tips? i have his laptop for the next hour...
[09:01:09] <christophler> kborchers: I just want to display a tooltip, I was expecting like 1 minute to add script tag... Am I missing the point? Tooltips are surely boilerplate?
[09:01:14] <christophler> what tooltip plugin do you use?
[09:02:10] <kborchers> christophler: i don't usually use tooltips.
[09:02:21] <kborchers> using a plugin is usually a little more that just drop in code and go
[09:02:38] <kborchers> you usually need a little knowledge about how it works to get it going
[09:02:42] <imc> ~/quit
[09:02:55] <christophler> kborchers: ... hmmm well the docs suck !
[09:03:35] <christophler> kborchers: ... much as I am happy to spend time, the links on the docs pages dont link to stuff... I reckon, that the "position" plugin referred to in the tooltip docs refers to a plugin that is now part of jquery UI
[09:03:39] <christophler> meh anyway
[09:03:53] <kborchers> christophler: you are close
[09:03:57] <ari5av> it's a third party plugin, docs sometimes tend to be a little sparse
[09:03:58] <christophler> heh
[09:03:58] <kborchers> it will be part of UI with 1.9
[09:04:15] <ari5av> is there an ETA for ui 1.9 actually, now that you mention it?
[09:04:19] <kborchers> which is a couple months out I believe
[09:04:25] <christophler> kborchers: sorry to be agrivated, but I am.!!! So.. what tooltip plugin would you recommend? if any
[09:04:45] <alexr2> qtips2 is decent i think
[09:04:49] <christophler> kborchers: position is listed as a part of jquery UI, in the "utilities" sectiion
[09:04:53] <ritztech> anyone know a way to WRITE to a config.txt file WIthout Reloading the Whole page
[09:04:53] <christophler> thanks
[09:04:58] <gnarf> ari5av: no ETA - you'll know when we know :)
[09:05:19] <kborchers> christophler: position is part of UI, yes
[09:05:19] <christophler> ahh yes
[09:05:21] <gnarf> christophler: if you have any suggetions for how to improve the docs, we are listening
[09:05:22] <christophler> qtips...
[09:05:28] <christophler> thats what I ended up using last time
[09:05:29] <christophler> thakns
[09:05:41] <alexr2> no problem
[09:06:58] <christophler> gnarf: something like "to make this plugin work, download these plugins... " at the moment it says "depends on position.js".. or so... and then that links to a page that has no actual plugin attached to it, then you go searching on the web and you have to navgiate the hellish jqueryUI download page etc.. by which point one is confused, and if, the plugin doesnt work, you dont know which part of the steps you got wrong
[09:07:30] <gnarf> christophler: you talking about tooltips in 1.9?
[09:07:31] <smplstk> "hellish jqueryUI download page"
[09:07:38] <christophler> Plus both Jquery and QTip2 are "experiencing malware problems"
[09:07:40] <gnarf> because like if you are using 1.9 you have position
[09:07:44] <kborchers> christophler: what is hellish about the UI download page?
[09:07:59] <smplstk> ya - I want to know what's hellish about it too.
[09:08:20] <kborchers> i'm curious so that if there are common problems people have, we can fix them
[09:08:21] <christophler> kborchers: its quite difficult to understand, imo, the relationship between jquery and JqueryUI. once you do.. its fine
[09:08:36] <christophler> Ive been programming for maybe 20 years
[09:08:36] <gnarf> the 1.9 milestone releases include position and tooltip
[09:08:40] <christophler> 10 years web development
[09:08:42] <christophler> yes
[09:08:44] <christophler> gnarf
[09:08:51] <gnarf> ?csb
[09:08:59] <christophler> that will be great... Here.. download this and you will have tooltops
[09:09:00] <christophler> tips
[09:09:07] <widoz> some one use nivoslider? i've a problem width fade effect on chrome
[09:09:18] <smplstk> gnarf: bot-t is dead
[09:09:22] <christophler> Jquery UI "Custom Download" page, with themes also and them the themes colour setup is completely baffling to most people
[09:09:23] <smplstk> but I'll help you out
[09:09:27] <smplstk> COOL STORY BRO
[09:09:29] <gnarf> smplstk: well the people here know what i mean ;)
[09:09:40] <smplstk> aka: me
[09:09:55] <gnarf> christophler: thats not where you should be for a 1.9 milestone release anyway
[09:10:06] <gnarf> tooltip in UI is "unreleased"
[09:10:12] <christophler> So which tooltip plugin is going to bepart of UI
[09:10:13] <christophler> ?
[09:10:18] <gnarf> christophler: "tooltip"
[09:10:39] <christophler> gnarf: so why are people telling me that "tooltip" is a thirdparty plugin, and the docs are probabaly a bit sparse?
[09:10:47] <kborchers> christophler: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.tooltip.js
[09:10:55] <gnarf> christophler: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/
[09:10:58] <gnarf> what kborchers said
[09:11:01] <gnarf> i was still typing it
[09:11:04] <kborchers> heh
[09:11:05] <christophler> great
[09:11:06] <christophler> ok
[09:11:19] <christophler> great support, sorry im being short, Im tired and I want to go to the gym
[09:11:31] <gnarf> christophler: there is probably a third party plugin named "tootltip" as well
[09:11:59] <christophler> well.. whats the one that is http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Tooltip
[09:12:08] <christophler> that looks pretty damned firstparty to me
[09:12:58] <christophler> im actually confused
[09:13:06] <christophler> hah, doesnt happen that often"
[09:13:15] <christophler> well not except whenin pypydev

[09:13:55] <johnline3> ueu make polygons?
[09:14:13] <polygonpusher> some times I pushem around
[09:14:29] <polygonpusher> but that talk is for #blender3d
[09:14:32] <johnline3> me tou :v http://johnline.bastage.net/img/cgi/ma/adco/trailer07.png
[09:14:48] <polygonpusher> very nice
[09:15:00] <johnline3> ty
[09:15:09] <johnline3> i liked the bit where it was shiney
[09:15:45] <mantas322> welp at least I got to the root of my issue with "Unexpected token ILLEGAL"   and all the lagg
[09:15:47] <mantas322> its the xml

[09:17:22] <christophler> Ive added jquert, jqueryUI with position and jquery.ui.tooltip
[09:17:40] <christophler> and there is no tooltip function on jQuery("selecto").tooltip()
[09:17:45] <christophler> and there is no tooltip function on jQuery("selecto")...
[09:17:51] <chrisinajar> HAH. my problem i posted earlier was his virus scanner.....
[09:17:52] <johnline3> wau very cool
[09:18:21] <polygonpusher> Eviltwin: you have been a big help want to take a stab at my last q:
[09:19:09] <Eviltwin> Kinda busy at the moment
[09:19:14] <Eviltwin> Might have more time later
[09:19:17] <christophler> oops
[09:19:18] <polygonpusher> np thanks
[09:19:19] <christophler> no i didnt
[09:21:10] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: ask anyway, someone else may be able to help you
[09:22:20] <lxsameer> how can i select a tag using its two attr ( name and value)
[09:22:42] <christophler> and the actual download that arrives when you choose a custom download from jquery-ui is totally baffling
[09:23:03] <pifantastic> lxsameer: I think $("foo[name='foo'][value='bar']") works
[09:23:32] <mantas322> displaying xml with jQuery.js = 45 seconds    |||| WITHOUT = <1 second
[09:23:39] <lxsameer> pifantastic: no
[09:24:17] <chrisinajar> mantas322: jquery isn't that slow, you're doing something wrong.
[09:24:27] <polygonpusher> chrisinajar: getting Uncaught TypeError: Object .testimonial has no method 'createDocumentFragment' on my project but in jsfiddle it works? http://jsfiddle.net/ef7fu/12/
[09:24:47] <pifantastic> lxsameer: yes http://jsfiddle.net/baWGf/
[09:25:03] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: i don't get any errors
[09:25:04] <mantas322> i knwo im not saying it is
[09:25:18] <chrisinajar> mantas322: then don't imply that it is, it's misleading
[09:25:26] <mantas322> I didnt mean to im sorry
[09:25:29] <polygonpusher> error is happening on $original = $(allText, ".testimonial"); in my project
[09:25:39] <chrisinajar> not sure what you were getting at if that wasn't your purpose :P
[09:25:50] <lxsameer> pifantastic: yeah you're right thanks
[09:26:03] <pifantastic> polygonpusher: are you sure $('.testimonial') exists?
[09:26:05] <mantas322> just speaking outloud ignore me
[09:26:24] <polygonpusher> it does
[09:26:49] <polygonpusher> but that makes me wonder allText is not getting set correctly
[09:27:15] <chrisinajar> yeah, i get no errors, tried in chrome and ff...
[09:27:26] <chrisinajar> attempting ie...
[09:28:37] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: i get no errors in chrome, ff, or IE.
[09:28:54] <polygonpusher> thanks for looking, I'm gonna try some thing
[09:29:04] <chrisinajar> do you get errors on your browser?
[09:29:14] <polygonpusher> yeah its on chrome
[09:29:25] <polygonpusher> but I think allText is not getting set correctly
[09:29:30] <chrisinajar> and this doesn't work?: http://jsfiddle.net/ef7fu/12/
[09:29:41] <polygonpusher> that does
[09:29:46] <ramkam001> Hi there, a jquery mobile question : is it possible to - properly* - create a new page via javascript (for example, in the callback of a $.post; why ? : i only want the server to give json data and have javascript deduce the html markup) ? (*: it 'seems' to work by dumping the page in the $('body'), then calling $.mobile.changePage($('#id')); but i suspect that this is not the best practice as the history gets messed up big time.
[09:29:49] <polygonpusher> thats why I'm like ? what?
[09:33:07] <ramkam001> maybe i'm in the wrong channel / jqm is only a plugin ?
[09:33:25] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: whats your code supposed to do? I've found a few errors in it
[09:33:33] <EAN407> "#jquerymobile"
[09:33:33] <chrisinajar> and also now see what it's supposed to do, and it was indeed not working
[09:33:57] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: you might want to let people know what the expected output is when pastebining, i thought it was working when it wasn't :)
[09:34:21] <NoiseEee> ramkam001: if you're replacing the entire contents of a webpage, you might ask yourself why you're using XHR at all, versus a typical page change / form post
[09:35:05] <ramkam001> NoiseEee: i append pages on the fly, and destroy them when needed
[09:35:11] <EAN407> does a trick exist where i can use the click event also on a draggable?
[09:35:19] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: http://jsfiddle.net/ef7fu/15/
[09:35:40] <chrisinajar> EAN407: like mousedown?
[09:35:58] <EAN407> chrisinajar: the problem is on drop the mouse event is also fired
[09:36:09] <chrisinajar> no, mouseup is
[09:36:23] <NoiseEee> ramkam001: changing the DOM is one thing, replacing the enter <html> or <body> is another and causes more problems than it could possibly solve
[09:36:26] <EAN407> chrisinajar: and the distance and delay options do not work on IE
[09:36:29] <NoiseEee> s/enter/entire
[09:36:41] <chrisinajar> EAN407: they work for me, are you getting any console errors?
[09:36:55] <EAN407> chrisinajar: you mean delay and distance?
[09:37:20] <chrisinajar> EAN407: i mean nothing doesn't work in IE for me, are you getting errors? what does "not work" mean?
[09:37:37] <chrisinajar> EAN407: do they turn bright purple? do they do nothing? do they crash your browser? do they spam errors?
[09:37:52] <ramkam001> NoiseEee: Yes. But I'm not replacing the entire html. I just need to have js append a new div with data-role=page, and have jqm interpret this like if i did a changePage(url)
[09:38:07] <EAN407> chrisinajar: no errors. if you use the option delay or distance in a draggable the whole drag functionality doesnt work in IE7 & IE8
[09:38:21] <chrisinajar> works in IE8 for me, haven't tested in 7
[09:38:40] <EAN407> chrisinajar: maybe you can check the example code in your IE http://jsfiddle.net/PWTfs/
[09:38:48] <chrisinajar> again, though, what does "doesn't work" mean?
[09:38:51] <chrisinajar> you never answered that
[09:38:57] <chrisinajar> do you mean "does nothing?"
[09:39:04] <NoiseEee> ramkam001: jqm is a red-herring i should think; you should google 'jquery bbq history state'
[09:39:17] <EAN407> chrisinajar: scroll up :) "the whole drag functionality doesnt work"
[09:39:17] <chrisinajar> knowing what it doesn't do doesn't help me troubleshoot the issue any :P
[09:39:26] <chrisinajar> SO WHAT'S IT DO INSTEAD
[09:39:31] <EAN407> nothing
[09:39:32] <chrisinajar> "doesn't work" means nothing
[09:39:34] <chrisinajar> thank you
[09:39:44] <chrisinajar> that was harder than it shoulda been :P
[09:39:50] <EAN407> hehe sorry :)
[09:40:07] <chrisinajar> there are js errors in IE
[09:40:21] <v0lZy> hello
[09:40:25] <polygonpusher> hey chrisinajar http://jsfiddle.net/ef7fu/27/
[09:40:34] <v0lZy> I request some help, I have a bit of a difficulty with some opacity....
[09:41:06] <v0lZy> anyone have any idea why this doesnt work: $(this).stop().animate({paddingTop: "10px", opacity: "0"},{duration: 300}, function() {
[09:41:08] <v0lZy> 				$(this).css('opacity', '1');
[09:41:10] <polygonpusher> this is the full idea of the project I'm working. Oddly its simi works in jsfiddle but on my site I get that same error
[09:41:10] <v0lZy> 				$(this).removeClass('FocusMenuLink');
[09:41:11] <v0lZy> 			});
[09:41:43] <ramkam001> NoiseEee: There's a lot of work in this plugin, i'm looking for advice to see if i can use this plugin as framework, and get to know where the limitations are.
[09:42:00] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: why do you do the original thing? i'm pretty sure $(".testimonials .testimonial").eq(0) would do the same thing
[09:42:18] <chrisinajar> v0lZy: paste into a pastebin and i will help you. i'm not going to read your code from irc, though.
[09:42:21] <EAN407> chrisinajar: i read about some workarounds. like putting a fuckin hughe letter in the div.
[09:42:31] <v0lZy> k
[09:43:05] <EAN407> chrisinajar: but to be honest i dont like hacks.
[09:43:06] <NoiseEee> ramkam001: hmmm?  understand that loading any new content via XHR is going to 'mess' with the back button; its a solution you need to implement, jqm notwithstanding
[09:43:15] <chrisinajar> EAN407: what's that supposed to do?
[09:43:16] <polygonpusher> its cause when I set the text it wipes out the original text
[09:43:19] <v0lZy> chrisinajar: http://pastebin.com/kWg64M63
[09:43:21] <chrisinajar> EAN407: i see 4 boxes and some numbers
[09:43:37] <chrisinajar> v0lZy: sorry, use jsfiddle.net please
[09:43:40] <chrisinajar> makes it easier to debug :)
[09:43:41] <NoiseEee> ramkam001: or #jquerymobile
[09:43:48] <polygonpusher> If I dont keep a var with the original text it will wipe it out since I'm using the first div as the display
[09:44:03] <ramkam001> NoiseEee: yep, i'm there. thx
[09:44:04] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: why not do something like.....
[09:44:04] <EAN407> chrisinajar: just a simple drag & drop implementation. the location of the items (images in this case) is saved in an array. nothing special :)
[09:44:37] <v0lZy> http://jsfiddle.net/RFwW2/
[09:45:06] <v0lZy> its not a specific problem i think.. its just.. what i want to do is the moment opacity reaches zero, set opacity to 1
[09:45:19] <v0lZy> i thought i can just use a callback function
[09:45:22] <v0lZy> but nothing happens
[09:45:40] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: $(".testimonials).data('values', []); $(".testimonials .testimonial").each(function() { $(".testimonials).data('values', $(".testimonials).data('values').push($(this).text()); });.... now testimonals  has a data element containing all the original text...
[09:45:52] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: even then, the way you select it is really quire bizarre
[09:46:20] <chrisinajar> v0lZy: what's .scroll
[09:47:22] <v0lZy> a class name.
[09:47:26] <v0lZy> its a menu button
[09:47:37] <v0lZy> basically i have a text link
[09:47:37] <chrisinajar> v0lZy: try this: $(this).stop(true).animate({paddingTop: "10px", opacity: "0"},300).animate({opacity: "1"},0);
[09:48:29] <v0lZy> ha, that does the trick
[09:48:36] <v0lZy> but i still need to remove the class... i just string it?
[09:49:30] <chrisinajar> hang on
[09:50:30] <chrisinajar> http://jsfiddle.net/RFwW2/1/
[09:50:32] <chrisinajar> made it work your way
[09:50:58] <chrisinajar> v0lZy: you may want to check the api documentation first next time, your function wasn't in the right spot on the parameter count
[09:51:26] <black_warlock> how can i extract the href value ?
[09:51:39] <v0lZy> thanks chrisinajar, stringig it also works so
[09:51:43] <black_warlock> .attr ?
[09:51:47] <alexr2> .attr("href")
[09:51:49] <chrisinajar> black_warlock: $("#mything").attr('href');
[09:51:55] <black_warlock> ty
[09:52:17] <chrisinajar> black_warlock: any key="value" in html can be fetched or set with attr, even ones not in standard html
[09:52:51] <snagnever> hey! how can i select one elemtn that has the class .nome but DOESNT have the class .header ?
[09:52:59] <snagnever> .nome~.header?
[09:54:11] <black_warlock> whats wrong here
[09:54:12] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/SUvP5/
[09:54:47] <black_warlock> i wish every link get opened inside #result div
[09:55:30] <snagnever> $('#comparacao td.header.nome')
[09:55:39] <snagnever> i mean, td.header!.nome
[09:56:21] <gnarf> $("#comparaco td.header").not(".nome")
[09:56:45] <polygonpusher> so how wold you then access that data stored? http://jsfiddle.net/ef7fu/31/
[09:56:53] <gnarf> also, snagnever: http://api.jquery.com/not-selector
[09:57:21] <gnarf> $("#comparaco td.header:not(.nome)")
[09:57:46] <Michael> Has anyone had the issue with jQueryUI accordion where a link inside accordion element causes the accordion to open?
[09:57:58] <Michael> Trying to figure out if I can tell the accordion not to bubble to those child elements
[09:58:50] <gnarf> Michael: demo of the problem on jsfiddle.net ?
[09:59:12] <Michael> gnarf: so no :P
[09:59:32] <MagePsycho> how to remove all hidden form fields except one with id=parent?
[09:59:58] <MagePsycho> $(':hidden...').remove()???
[10:00:42] <Michael> $(':hidden').not('#someId').remove() ?
[10:01:03] <gnarf> MagePsycho: $('input[type="hidden"]:not(#someId)').remove()
[10:01:06] <gnarf> or yes
[10:01:22] <MagePsycho> OK
[10:01:26] <gnarf> input[type="hidden"] is better than :hidden btws
[10:01:37] <Michael> gnarf: What I meant was "so your answer is no"
[10:02:02] <Michael> It would be extremely difficult to replicate this out on jsfiddle and our project is top secret.
[10:02:23] <gnarf> Michael: i haven't had that issue, but i don't use accordion, if you had a demo of the problem on jsfiddle, i could probably help you find the solution though
[10:02:49] <Michael> thank you anyway
[10:02:52] <gnarf> Michael: if you can get it to work (aka break) with MINIMAL code on jsfiddle
[10:03:08] <gnarf> then you might find the answer to your problem anyway
[10:03:15] <EAN407> chrisinajar: so basicly how did you get the delay option work in IE7?
[10:03:57] <gnarf> chrisinajar: btw, .prop("href") might be better than .attr
[10:04:41] <Michael> gnarf: You pass the accordion a header element which gets the event bound to open the accordion. The problem is we have an anchor inside that element which also gets the event
[10:04:48] <Michael> And attempts to stopPropogation() etc fail
[10:05:06] <Michael> I was hoping someone else had this specific problem
[10:05:10] <chrisinajar> dammit, i just sovled someone's problem but can't find who it was! :P
[10:05:19] <gnarf> Michael: well it sounds like a bubbling event
[10:05:22] <Michael> yes
[10:05:32] <riyonuk> So what exactly do this mean? I know when you click on something, it invokes the SelectPatient function, but what does the "this" imply? $(".oneresult").click(function() { 	    SelectPatient(this); 	});
[10:05:40] <Michael> So we have stopPropgoate, stopImmediatePropogation, preventDefault and return false
[10:05:41] <gnarf> Michael: are you manually binding the "open the accordion" event ?
[10:05:43] <Michael> but it still opens the accordion.
[10:05:46] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: you get the data with .data
[10:05:51] <Michael> No, the plugin is doing that
[10:05:58] <polyrhythmic> ahh I have to turn off my poly* hilight
[10:05:59] <chrisinajar> black_warlock: return false at the end of your function
[10:06:06] <byebyebyezzz> I have this   var $firstone = $('#interact div.active'); outside of a function to get the first div. inside a function, I am trying to do var $next = $firstone; but it doesnt work. Did I do something wrong?
[10:06:09] <mattis_> what data grid/table plugin do you recommend?
[10:06:10] <Aidanie> I'm attempting to append to a select with the following.. http://jsfiddle.net/PGMyT/8/ could anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?
[10:06:17] <gnarf> Michael: and you've tried to stopProp on the header > a ?
[10:06:25] <polygonpusher> http://jsfiddle.net/ef7fu/41/ I think there was some missing " but now the push method is throwing and error on the array
[10:06:27] <Michael> No - I'll try that :) Thanks.
[10:06:37] <gnarf> Michael: stopprop on the header itself wont do much
[10:06:45] <Michael> No it's on the anchor
[10:06:49] <chrisinajar> polygonpusher: yeah, i didn't test that code, it was just to show you the concept
[10:07:03] <chrisinajar> anyway, too many people here and i'm very hungry
[10:07:05] <chrisinajar> lunch time.
[10:07:08] <Michael> enjoy
[10:07:13] <gnarf> Michael: this sounds like something thats reproducable with demo code on jsfiddle
[10:07:15] <black_warlock> where ?
[10:08:13] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/SUvP5/2/
[10:08:45] <gnarf> polygonpusher: "push" will edit in place
[10:08:52] <gnarf> it actually returns the new length of the array
[10:09:13] <gnarf> so when you elem.data("values", elem.data("values").push() ) you're overwriting "values" with a number
[10:09:17] <gnarf> which doesn't have push
[10:09:29] <gnarf> you just need elem.data("values").push()
[10:10:14] <gnarf> polygonpusher: also, you should cache your selectors
[10:10:28] <byebyebyezzz> I have this   var $firstone = $('#interact div.active'); outside of a function to get the first div. inside a function, I am trying to do var $next = $firstone; but it doesnt work. Did I do something wrong?
[10:10:45] <black_warlock> chrisinajar where http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/SUvP5/2/
[10:11:15] <mantas322> test
[10:12:44] <skapism> Hi, I have a table with several columns, and I have several dropdowns with which I filter those columns. Currently the dropdowns work by checking the value of the td. With long tables (> 500 entries), I notice that filtering takes around 0.8 seconds. Would adding the tds classes or any other meta data and filtering by that speed up the process?
[10:13:03] <gnarf> polygonpusher: http://jsfiddle.net/ef7fu/47/
[10:14:27] <skapism> That would contaminate the dom pretty much, I would have stuff like <td class="2002">2002</td>, but would it be faster to filter by?
[10:15:14] <gnarf> skapism: working with long lists like that is bound to be slowish
[10:15:47] <skapism> Yeah, I'm more asking about jquery's internal performance, if the lookup costs for content are higher than for metadata in that case
[10:15:55] <polygonpusher> thank you gnarf
[10:15:58] <gnarf> skapism: but to answer your question, if the text is "static" it might speed you up to store a cache of the data on the <tr>'s .data() and use that to filter instead of having to select the correct td and call .text() every time
[10:16:15] <MagePsycho> jQuery(':hidden').not('#category').remove(); --->not working
[10:16:21] <MagePsycho> this destroys the page design
[10:16:21] <MagePsycho> jQuery(':hidden').not('#category').remove();
[10:16:38] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector
[10:17:02] <gnarf> i assume you want input[type=hidden]
[10:17:08] <brantwynn> can anyone tell me why these markers would show up when there is an alert inside the $.each but they would not show up without the alert?  http://jsfiddle.net/fD6uT/2/
[10:17:09] <skapism> gnarf: what do you mean with static in this case?
[10:17:09] <gnarf> not all things that are display: none
[10:17:22] <gnarf> skapism: like you aren't changing the text inside the TD's at runtime
[10:17:36] <skapism> gnarf: nope, I'm just filtering
[10:18:41] <gnarf> skapism: imagine something like $("tr").data("columns")[5]
[10:18:48] <gnarf> having the text
[10:19:13] <gnarf> skapism: will probably be faster than $( this ).find( "td:nth-child(5)" ).text()
[10:19:47] <skapism> gnarf: so I store the data while loading the page?
[10:19:50] <gnarf> MagePsycho: input[type="hidden"] instead of :hidden, i believe i suggested this once already
[10:20:02] <gnarf> skapism: or the first time you look it up
[10:20:05] <MagePsycho> ok will try that
[10:20:09] <gnarf> skapism: paste the code you're using?
[10:20:14] <supertrue> How would I select <p><em>P tags with only an em tag inside</em></p> and not this: <p><em>Text in em tags</em> and outside of em tags</p>
[10:20:29] <skapism> gnarf: k, sec
[10:20:34] <gnarf> supertrue: you dont
[10:20:57] <supertrue> gnarf: why?!
[10:21:07] <gnarf> supertrue: there isn't a selector for that
[10:21:11] <gnarf> text nodes aren't selectable
[10:21:13] <gnarf> but
[10:22:32] <skapism> gnarf: http://pastebin.com/DdA5LgAt
[10:22:38] <gnarf> you could do something like $("p").filter( function() { var $this = $(this); return $.trim($this.text()) === $this.children("em:first-child").text() });
[10:22:45] <gnarf> supertrue: ^^^
[10:22:55] <gnarf> i forgot to trim the string on the right
[10:22:58] <gnarf> but you get the idea
[10:23:13] <gnarf> skapism: yeah, thats all sorts of ineffecient
[10:23:27] <skapism> gnarf: yeah, I imagined as much
[10:24:18] <gnarf> $("#list tr").each(function() { var $this = $(this); $this.data( "tdtext", $this.children().map(function() { return $(this).text(); }).get() ); });
[10:25:40] <gnarf> $("#list tr").hide().filter(function() { return $(this).data("tdtext")[n].indexOf( selection ) != -1 }).show();
[10:25:52] <skapism> gnarf: k, so that doesn't search all the tds in a column, it searches trs. I imagine it would be more efficient with filter combinations
[10:26:45] <MagePsycho> gnarf -- that works great :)
[10:26:59] <gnarf> anyway, im outta here
[10:27:08] <skapism> thanks, gnarf
[10:27:13] <gnarf> good luck on that stuff guys
[10:27:50] <polygonpusher> Almost got it but I'm still having an issue with it wiping out the first var http://jsfiddle.net/ef7fu/67/
[10:28:38] <polygonpusher> the first testimonial is getting replaced in the data when it gets updated on doc
[10:29:03] <polygonpusher> the whole idea of the use of data was that its storing the original content
[10:30:15] <gnarf> polygonpusher: you're replacing the p/.name text
[10:30:43] <polygonpusher> correct
[10:30:44] <gnarf> polygonpusher: try just .hide()/.show()ing instead of replacing text
[10:31:07] <gnarf> polygonpusher: you're storing a reference to the 'first' testimonial as the element is on page
[10:31:09] <gnarf> it doesn't copy it
[10:31:13] <gnarf> so when yuo change its text
[10:31:16] <gnarf> it blows up
[10:31:34] <gnarf> either a) make your container a CLONE of one of the already shown ones and edit it from there
[10:31:37] <Aidanie> I'm attempting to append to a select with the following.. http://jsfiddle.net/PGMyT/8/ could anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?
[10:31:56] <gnarf> or b) use hide and show
[10:32:12] <gnarf> polygonpusher: there is all sorts of bad logic in this
[10:32:33] <gnarf> polygonpusher: calling geNext() twice in the same rotation sounds like a problem
[10:32:34] <gnarf> etc
[10:32:58] <polygonpusher> so in the hide show would it be a matter placing the content in the correct place via css?
[10:33:06] <gnarf> polygonpusher: btw: http://gfyackle.com/js/slideshow.js
[10:33:27] <gnarf> that takes a <ul><li> and makes a really simple "rotator"
[10:33:52] <gnarf> polygonpusher: just to show you how i would approach what you're trying to do
[10:34:01] <polygonpusher> thanks
[10:34:24] <gnarf> i think that one actually like fades and stuff too
[10:34:41] <gnarf> but it just uses addclass / removeclass for shown
[10:35:54] <gnarf> polygonpusher: its used on http://gfyackle.com/ if you want to see what it actually ends up doing
[10:36:00] <gnarf> i wrote that a few months back for a client
[10:36:03] <gnarf> anyway, gone for real now
[10:36:33] <polygonpusher> thanks gnarf
[10:37:57] <brantwynn> updated... still only showing the vector overlay when i have an alert breaking up the loop... http://jsfiddle.net/fD6uT/2/
[10:38:07] <brantwynn> really weird
[10:47:12] <lxsameer> when i append a tag to another tag html, new tag did not effect on parent tag height, what shoud i do
[10:48:54] <sailboat> hey guys, has anyone else experience trouble with $.get?
[10:49:16] <sailboat> I'm a little confused as to where the response is stored and how to reference it
[10:49:41] <lxsameer> sailboat: use $.ajax
[10:50:32] <sailboat> lxsameer: im a little unfamiliar with that, but i'll google that
[10:50:49] <lxsameer> sailboat: its very easy and useful
[10:52:13] <sailboat> lxsameer: so i'd use XMLHttprequest?
[10:52:43] <lxsameer> sailboat: no first argument of success handler
[10:54:25] <sailboat> lxsameer: OHHHH
[10:54:54] <sailboat> lxsameer: I see now, instead of using $.get, $.ajax, i didn't realize they did the same thing...new to web programming
[10:55:10] <lxsameer> sailboat: ;)
[10:58:36] <sailboat> lxsameer: for some reason, the response is still empty
[10:59:05] <sailboat> lxsameer: if I put the same query in my address bar, it returns data
[10:59:28] <lxsameer> sailboat: use firebug to trace the req/res process
[11:00:25] <sailboat> lxsameer: thats exactly what im doing.  The response field for the request is empty
[11:01:07] <lxsameer> sailboat: so firebug prove that response is empty ?
[11:01:17] <lxsameer> *proof
[11:01:28] <lxsameer> sh*t damn
[11:02:03] <sailboat> lxsameer: well if I'm doing this correctly, I'm viewing XHR tab and I've expanded the GET request and under the response tab, it's empty
[11:03:16] <lxsameer> sailboat:  i think located in console tab , but whatever if your response is empty something is wrong with your server side app
[11:04:17] <sailboat> lxsameer: why would the server post it in the web browser with the same string
[11:04:29] <sailboat> lxsameer: by string, I mean url
[11:04:55] <lxsameer> sailboat: sorry i can't understand
[11:05:03] <sailboat> lxsameer: I know what i'll do, I'll try telneting the GET request
[11:05:37] <sailboat> lxsameer: when I place the URL that im using for the .get and .ajax into my web browser's address bar and click go, it responds with the correct data
[11:08:32] <lxsameer> sailboat: hmm thats strange , dpaste your js code please
[11:11:53] <sailboat> lxsameer: do you know a good place to paste it?  I don't want to spam the channel
[11:12:26] <sailboat> lxsameer: also, I can't post the url
[11:12:41] <sailboat> lxsameer: (the one used by the get request)
[11:12:43] <lxsameer> sailboat: i use dpaste.com
[11:12:57] <lxsameer> sailboat: but people here use jsfiddle
[11:13:50] <Angelov> sailboat, pastebin.com?
[11:14:41] <sailboat> http://dpaste.com/687314/
[11:15:16] <Eviltwin> You didn't close the $(document).ready(function() {

[11:15:51] <sailboat> <3 you guys, I'm going to go staple my face to a wall
[11:16:41] <lxsameer> :d
[11:17:42] <sailboat> wait no, I didn't pase correctly
[11:17:44] <sailboat> it was there
[11:17:46] <sailboat> ?
[11:17:47] <sailboat> hol don
[11:18:45] <sailboat> yeah, I didn't paste correctly, there were originally comments and I erased them all and accidentally erased the closing bracked in dpaste
[11:18:46] <lxsameer> sailboat: i think  you should escape url too. and also add two more argument to that success fucntion
[11:18:48] <chrisinajar> oohh, wallfacestaple...
[11:19:13] <sailboat> so just for the world to know, i DID close my functions correctly
[11:19:21] <sailboat> lol
[11:19:30] <chrisinajar> argument count doesn't matter in javascript, so long as you don't need the values...
[11:19:54] <Eviltwin> Even if you do need the values, it doesn't matter
[11:20:00] <Eviltwin> You can get them from "arguments"
[11:20:08] <sailboat> so it's like lambda calculus?>
[11:20:18] <chrisinajar> Eviltwin: yeah, but that makes for shitty looking code
[11:20:35] <sailboat> anyone here ever programmed with scheme?
[11:20:57] <Eviltwin> We called it ((())(())((())))((())((((()()())(()())

[11:23:10] <Eviltwin> I don't think anyone can explain anything about IE
[11:23:20] <sailboat> here hold on, I have a great tutorial
[11:23:26] <EAN407> chrisinajar: i now simplified the script so its easier to see.
[11:23:31] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin, your fix doesnt work for me

[11:24:01] <sailboat> that should explain it all
[11:24:23] <gyzmodo> red box's height largen than red's
[11:24:23] <EAN407> well my IE says. success denied. select.js line 168 char 28

[11:25:37] <sailboat> man this javascript is frustrating me, I'm used to C++ and C.  Im using MVC and it makes me want to punt a baby sometimes

[11:25:49] <lxsameer> what is the best way to add an element inside another one?
[11:25:52] <EAN407> sailboat: nice picture :))
[11:25:57] <chrisinajar> lxsameer: .append
[11:25:59] <sailboat> :D
[11:26:02] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: Can you math?
[11:26:46] <NoiseEee> EAN407: what is select.js?
[11:26:49] <lxsameer> chrisinajar: i used that, but height of my parent element did not changed
[11:26:57] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin
[11:26:59] <EAN407> its the error i get on jsfiddle
[11:27:01] <gyzmodo> of course
[11:27:12] <gyzmodo> gray's height = red's height
[11:27:17] <sailboat> anyways, can someone please help me with structuring my get request and understanding where the response is stored?
[11:27:19] <pom> If I do $('.foo').each(function() { var bar = 'moo'; }); is there anyway to access bar from outside the function?
[11:27:24] <EAN407> http://jsfiddle.net/codemirror/js/select.js
[11:27:28] <sailboat> is the response parsed internall?
[11:27:35] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: Then you should know that the document height minus the header height is only the header height under a very specific circumstance
[11:27:35] <sailboat> (which is what I'm assuming)
[11:27:59] <chrisinajar> pom: no, what you're looking for is $(this).data('bar', 'moo') along with a basic tutorial on variable scope.
[11:28:07] <gyzmodo> i dont need document height, i need gray boxe's height
[11:28:18] <chrisinajar> pom: it's vital you understand basic programming concepts before trying to produce something "useful"
[11:28:36] <NoiseEee> EAN407: sorry, don't have windows here, good luck
[11:28:40] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: Read this: http://jsfiddle.net/dEevJ/1/
[11:28:47] <Eviltwin> I just explained what it does
[11:28:57] <EAN407> "if (sel.createRange) return sel.createRange();" thats the code part in jquery where it says access denied
[11:28:59] <Eviltwin> See if you can figure out what to change to make them be the same height
[11:29:01] <Chopps> hey guys whats the equivalent in jquery of js' innerHTML?? i have a div and i want to load some html code inside it
[11:29:01] <pom> chrisinajar: I'm so happy you're telling me this. :)
[11:29:21] <chrisinajar> Chopps: .html
[11:29:21] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin, so why then red's height larger than grey's?
[11:29:31] <chrisinajar> Chopps: if you pass a param to it then it'll replace the html
[11:29:45] <Eviltwin> Because the document height is more than twice the height of the grey box
[11:29:47] <sailboat> chrisinajar: Hey can you help me understand what happens to the HTTP Response in the $.get
[11:29:53] <Eviltwin> I thought you said you could math
[11:29:53] <Chopps> nice, thank you chrisinajar
[11:30:08] <chrisinajar> sailboat: sure, make sure you have a success and error function first though.
[11:30:08] <gyzmodo> i dont need document's math
[11:30:15] <qrdoc> someone command the bot to give me the paste sites please
[11:30:25] <Eviltwin> ?paste
[11:30:26] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:30:28] <gyzmodo> if i set height for 300px grey
[11:30:44] <gyzmodo> red must be 300px too
[11:30:46] <sailboat> chrisinajar: well I don't understand the context of the success and error (specifically the argument in the function(argument) syntax, is that the response?
[11:30:59] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: then you should specify that when you first got here, because your code says otherwise :P
[11:31:03] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: I want you to paste in chat the one line from here that sets the height of the red box: http://jsfiddle.net/dEevJ/1/
[11:31:14] <sailboat> chrisinajar: I'm used to socket programming
[11:31:43] <Eviltwin> sailboat: XHR works at a higher level
[11:32:01] <Eviltwin> For one thing it transparently follows 3xx redirects as long as they don't violate SOP
[11:32:03] <chrisinajar> sailboat: it's nothing like socket programming at all, it's all done for you, the codes you get are the HTTP status code. you can only make HTTP requests with that, don't think of it like a socket.
[11:32:21] <sailboat> chrisinajar: okay
[11:32:23] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin, help me to fix my problem man :)
[11:32:34] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: Prove to me you're not totally blind first
[11:32:36] <sailboat> hey guys, give me a few to read up on a couple of things, I appreciate your help.
[11:32:40] <chrisinajar> sailboat: just check the docs, they say what the params are very clearly
[11:32:52] <sailboat> I'm going to familiarize myself with XHR
[11:33:18] <gyzmodo> i didnt know it is hard
[11:33:19] <sailboat> chrisinajar: if you're talking about jQuery's site, I did, but I was confused with syntax
[11:33:24] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: i'm siding with Eviltwin here, the things you say don't match your code whatsoever.
[11:33:37] <chrisinajar> sailboat: what confused you?
[11:33:44] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: Step 1: Open this page: http://jsfiddle.net/dEevJ/1/
[11:33:48] <chrisinajar> TOO HARD
[11:33:55] <Eviltwin> Step 2: Locate the line that sets the height of the red box
[11:34:01] <Eviltwin> Step 3: Copy the line
[11:34:04] <Eviltwin> Step 4: Paste it in IRC
[11:34:10] <sailboat> chrisinajar: the success callback
[11:34:25] <gyzmodo> $("#test").height($(document).height() - $("#header").height() + "px");
[11:34:34] <Eviltwin> Okay
[11:34:36] <sailboat> chrisinajar: specifically the argument in the function.  again, I'm used to C++ :(, I need to read a lil more on js
[11:34:43] <Eviltwin> Now break it apart
[11:34:48] <Eviltwin> $(document).height()
[11:34:50] <Eviltwin> What does that do?
[11:35:07] <gyzmodo> get's height of element
[11:35:11] <Eviltwin> Which element
[11:35:12] <chrisinajar> sailboat: it works just like C/C++, i do those too and have no problem with JS... It's still a C style syntax, it just has lamba functionality
[11:35:17] <gyzmodo> #test
[11:35:24] <Eviltwin> Why the hell would it do that
[11:35:25] <chrisinajar> no
[11:35:27] <chrisinajar> what
[11:35:29] <spikku> Some jQuery functions grab elements, but then how can you continue to use the jQuery functions on them? example: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/534398/
[11:35:31] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: drunk?
[11:35:36] <chrisinajar> or just not reading the code whatsoever
[11:35:38] <gyzmodo> oops
[11:35:50] <Eviltwin> I'm going back to my blind hypothesis
[11:36:07] <chrisinajar> spikku: $(this)
[11:36:20] <spikku> what? that simple? -.-
[11:36:26] <gyzmodo> get's #header's height
[11:36:39] <Eviltwin> Nope
[11:36:41] <spikku> thank you chrisinajar
[11:36:49] <gyzmodo> i mean DOM document
[11:36:50] <Eviltwin> $(document).height() doesn't get the header's height
[11:36:51] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: read the code, stop randomly guessing.
[11:36:55] <sailboat> chrisinajar: okay, treat it like lambda
[11:36:58] <Eviltwin> Yes, it gets the document height
[11:37:09] <chrisinajar> sailboat: those are just 3 arguments to a function///
[11:37:11] <Eviltwin> Next $("#header").height()
[11:37:15] <Eviltwin> What do you think that does?
[11:37:26] <chrisinajar> sailboat: success: function(arg1, arg2, arg3) { console.log(arg1); }
[11:37:43] <chrisinajar> sailboat: i think it's one of those "i get it so i don't see how you can't" things...
[11:37:48] <gyzmodo> this line gets header's height
[11:37:51] <Eviltwin> Okay
[11:37:55] <Eviltwin> Now there's a "-" symbol between
[11:37:58] <chrisinajar> huh, not blind, weird.
[11:37:58] <Eviltwin> What do you think that does?
[11:38:18] <gyzmodo> 200 - 200?
[11:38:41] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: you're getting ahead of yourself without actually paying attention to the questions. please stop and read the questions and answer them.
[11:38:57] <chrisinajar> also, why are you so autistic?
[11:39:20] <Eviltwin> I'm really not understanding how this is so hard
[11:39:43] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: in basic mathematics, what does "-" do?
[11:39:57] <gyzmodo> i think you didnt understand what i need
[11:40:05] <gyzmodo> 2-1=1
[11:40:06] <gyzmodo> :)
[11:40:10] <chrisinajar> hint: it does not subtract 200 from 200, but you're close.
[11:40:35] <Eviltwin> Okay, So let x = [document height] - [header height]
[11:40:51] <Eviltwin> Why would x be the header height?
[11:41:08] <gyzmodo> how can i change x to 400px?
[11:41:20] <chrisinajar> what the fuck is your malfunction.
[11:41:28] * chrisinajar gets back to work
[11:41:54] <gyzmodo> i am very newbie in js and jQuery
[11:42:00] <gyzmodo> sorry
[11:42:07] <Eviltwin> Are you like 10 years old?
[11:42:09] <sailboat> chrisinajar: ok, i figured out how to ask my quesiton, what type of object is the argument in the success callback
[11:42:10] <chrisinajar> i don't care, you couldn't name was "-" did.
[11:42:19] <chrisinajar> you're lacking basic 3rd grade math skills, bro
[11:42:43] <chrisinajar> sailboat: depends on what you specify as dataType, i think it's just text by default
[11:42:44] <EAN407> chrisinajar: ok i kind of nailed the bug
[11:42:56] <chrisinajar> EAN407: really? i'm curious myself...
[11:43:01] <EAN407> chrisinajar: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#delay-start take exact the same code
[11:43:06] <sailboat> chrisinajar: so if it was a regular http request, would that arugment be filled with the response?
[11:43:06] <EAN407> from the demo page
[11:43:13] <EAN407> and instead of text, put an image in
[11:43:15] <EAN407> it wont work
[11:43:16] <sailboat> chrisinajar: that's what i've been trying to find out
[11:43:18] <chrisinajar> sailboat: with the http of the page you requested
[11:43:40] <chrisinajar> sailboat: best bet with JS is to just try it and see, you can paste code into the developer console and run it to test it (F12)
[11:43:49] <sailboat> chrisinajar: hence, to see if the function is working, I try to print that argument right?  I'm trying to figure out if my test case is even a valid test case
[11:43:56] <gyzmodo> chrisinajar, do you mean subtract?
[11:44:09] <EAN407> chrisinajar: that means not even the demo page works if you put in an image.
[11:44:11] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: yup. though Eviltwin answered that for you so i don't count it
[11:44:46] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: ok, i'm going to stop making fun of you and give you a basic walkthrough of how to function as a programmer...
[11:44:51] <gyzmodo> i know basic math :)
[11:44:58] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: step one, figure out what you want? what do you want this to look like?
[11:45:05] <chrisinajar> no you don't.
[11:45:13] <gyzmodo> i've two divs, box1 and box2
[11:45:19] <chrisinajar> not my question
[11:45:21] <gyzmodo> box1's height is dynamic
[11:45:25] <chrisinajar> what do you want it to look like?
[11:45:26] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: Explain to me exactly what $("#test").height($(document).height() - $("#header").height() + "px"); does (not what you want it to do)
[11:45:43] <chrisinajar> he obviously has no clue what it does.
[11:45:50] <chrisinajar> he's made this more than apparent
[11:45:54] <sailboat> i think he's just trying to get someone to write it for him
[11:46:16] <Eviltwin> sailboat: And it's particularly shocking because he doesn't even have to add any code
[11:46:17] <chrisinajar> he's just guessing what to put in for code until it works, people at my workplace do that sometimes and it makes me want to stab them repeatedly
[11:46:19] <gyzmodo> for example if box1's height 300px box2's height must be 300px too
[11:46:23] <gyzmodo> that's all
[11:46:29] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: Explain to me exactly what $("#test").height($(document).height() - $("#header").height() + "px"); does (not what you want it to do)
[11:46:46] <chrisinajar> Eviltwin: we both know he can't do that.
[11:47:04] <sailboat> callvote map hub3aeroq3
[11:47:18] <chrisinajar> Eviltwin: also, you don't need the +"px" :)
[11:47:35] <Eviltwin> chrisinajar: I didn't code this, I just refactored it slightly from what he had
[11:47:47] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin, because red box's height larger than grey's
[11:47:50] <chrisinajar> indeed, i saw the original too
[11:47:54] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: Explain to me exactly what $("#test").height($(document).height() - $("#header").height() + "px"); does (not what you want it to do)
[11:49:03] <gyzmodo> it would be great if we together fix my problem :)
[11:49:08] <EAN407> chrisinajar: can you confirm my bug?
[11:49:17] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: you can't fix it until you know what's wrong
[11:49:22] <Eviltwin> gyzmodo: It'd be great if you could contribute to the helping
[11:49:38] <sailboat> gyzmodo: you have to earn your answer sir
[11:49:44] <sailboat> gyzmodo: teach a man to fish
[11:50:06] <sailboat> gyzmodo: you got this bro, just break it up
[11:50:18] <gyzmodo> i'm just learning jQuery
[11:50:28] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ gyzmodo
[11:50:29] <bot-t> gyzmodo, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:50:30] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: no you're not, you're learning nothing.
[11:50:33] <kborchers> ?cc
[11:50:33] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[11:50:33] <libryder> anyone know of a way to embed a gist into a jqueryui tab?
[11:50:49] <sailboat> gyzmodo: I am too, but you're trying to drive a nascar without being able to drive a gokart
[11:51:10] <sailboat> gyzmodo: if you can't understand javascript, you can't understand jQuery
[11:51:16] <Eviltwin> libryder: Start by looking here maybe? http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/
[11:51:18] <libryder> https://api.logmycalls.com/docs -- I have the script tag inside the jquery div tag but it looks like it's creating the actual div outside
[11:51:18] <chrisinajar> more like he's trying to drive a gokart before he knows how to use his hands.
[11:51:18] <Chopps> guys another question, i have an element with style="display: none;" how can i remove this? thanks
[11:51:34] <chrisinajar> Chopps: obj.show();
[11:51:35] <sailboat> gyzmodo: now looking at the code, what would you think is wrong?  Really think man.
[11:51:36] <kborchers> ?show @ Chopps
[11:51:37] <bot-t> Chopps, .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[11:51:49] <sailboat> gyzmodo: just take a guess, make some effort bro
[11:51:52] <libryder> Eviltwin: interesting, thanks
[11:51:54] <djnewbie> hello everyone, does anyone know how to check/find the click event on a submit button in a form?
[11:52:01] <Chopps> thank you chrisinajar and kborchers :D
[11:52:04] <chrisinajar> sailboat: he's been guessing at random for like an hour, don't enforce that :P
[11:52:18] <gyzmodo> sailboat, i don't know what's document height
[11:52:21] <NoiseEee> djnewbie: ignore the click event on a button, watch for the 'submit' event on the form
[11:52:21] <Eviltwin> chrisinajar: No, he hasnt
[11:52:26] <Eviltwin> He hasn't done shit for hours
[11:52:39] <kborchers> gyzmodo: ok, this has reached the point of trolling. answer the questions as asked and help us help you or GTFO
[11:52:39] <Eviltwin> He linked that paste this morning, I changed it and sent it back
[11:52:42] <chrisinajar> no, he was guessing what $(document).height() did, remember? :D
[11:52:46] <Eviltwin> And now he links the original again
[11:52:52] <sailboat> gyzmodo: the value of or the actual call?
[11:53:08] <gyzmodo> okay
[11:53:10] <djnewbie> NoiseEee: IE is calling my submit when there's a click event, i'm trying to devise a hack
[11:53:18] <gyzmodo> i am going to google it
[11:53:19] <chrisinajar> djnewbie: return false
[11:53:25] <Eviltwin> Oh, good
[11:53:30] <chrisinajar> lol, that'll go well :P
[11:53:32] <Eviltwin> yeah
[11:53:45] <chrisinajar> inb4 he's here again with the original paste in.... 45 minutes?
[11:53:47] <sailboat> gyzmodo: http://www.w3schools.com/js/ check this out man, seriously the tutorials don't take much time
[11:53:48] <gyzmodo> thanks for all and sorry
[11:54:08] <chrisinajar> gyzmodo: had you put an ounce of effort in instead of making excuses, this would be solved.
[11:54:25] <sailboat> gyzmodo: you're gonna get flamed if you don't make effort. People are on irc to help people willing to learn, and that involves trying
[11:54:44] <EAN407> can anyone please confirm my IE 6 / 7 / 8 bug which is the following. http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#delay-start replace the demo text with an image and dragg functionality wont work anymore.
[11:55:10] <aminho> hi guys, i'm loading jquery 1.7.1 dynamically in a page that already holds jquery 1.2.6. The issue i'm facing is that the page has added attributes to jQuery and these disappear when i load 1.7.1
[11:55:13] <Eviltwin> Come to think of it, I'm still waiting on a donation from muzone
[11:55:18] <sailboat> EAN407: All of those browers are about to be phased out due to HTML5, is it necessary to fix this problem?
[11:55:23] <aminho> anyone could point me to a way on how to avoid conflict ?
[11:55:31] <NoiseEee> aminho: don't load it twice.
[11:55:32] <Eviltwin> ?noConflict @ aminho
[11:55:33] <bot-t> aminho, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[11:55:33] <Eviltwin> :P
[11:55:43] <chrisinajar> EAN407: yup
[11:56:11] <aminho> Eviltwin, well the thing is that i have no access to that page, i'm delivering a piece of software that will be embedded in that target page
[11:56:26] <tom[]> hello! if i give $.ajax() a data property that is a boolean does it arrive at the server script in $_POST as a string 'true' or 'false'?
[11:56:33] <aminho> and this widget need jquery 1.7.1 (for the data function :) )
[11:56:57] <chrisinajar> tom[]: try it and see
[11:57:00] <EAN407> sailboat: of course its necessary to fix this problem. jquery is a really good framework. and if a "simple" implementation of drag and drop doesnt work in 50% of the browsers i thinks it worth fixing
[11:57:09] <Eviltwin> aminho: Take a look at the way this bookmarklet generator encapsulates jQuery: http://benalman.com/projects/run-jquery-code-bookmarklet/
[11:57:10] <tom[]> chrisinajar: i did and i can't believe my eyes
[11:57:17] <Eviltwin> It's kind of minified so it might be a little hard to read
[11:57:22] <chrisinajar> tom[]: what was your findings?
[11:57:24] <EAN407> sailboat: the problem is not even the sample code from jquery ui works if you put an image in.
[11:57:27] <aminho> Eviltwin: i was wondering if there was a way to load 1.7.1 in a variable, i've looked at noConflict but unfortunately, the custom attributes that are added to jquery 1.2.6 via jQuery.custom_attribute = are overriden and disappear
[11:57:34] <sailboat> EAN407: The reason it doesn't work is because the new jQuery uses newer conventions that are not programmed into those browsers.
[11:57:35] <tom[]> i'm seeing either 'true' or 'false'
[11:57:35] <Eviltwin> But it saves the reference to jQuery and uses noConflict(1) to restore any originals
[11:57:35] <aminho> Eviltwin, ok i'm taking a look
[11:57:43] <tom[]> that's so daft
[11:57:50] <chrisinajar> tom[]: why?
[11:58:06] <tom[]> neither of those value are boolean values
[11:58:15] <EAN407> sailboat: i see. i am not very common with jquery versions :)
[11:58:21] <chrisinajar> tom[]: indeed, http is an ascii protocol. strings only.
[11:58:31] <xp_prg> gnarf you here?
[11:58:44] <mindtonic> I have a question about jQuery Deferred functionality.  In Google Chrome it appears as if the when() calls are not waiting for completion before moving on to the done() and fail() methods.  Everything works as expected on Firefox but the actions are not executing in the proper order on Chrome.  Is this a common error?  Does anyone have any experience with this?
[11:58:56] <gnarf> sup
[11:58:57] <Eviltwin> aminho: I know how it works but it's a good exercise to take apart someone else's code and figure out how it works
[11:59:00] <mephux> ls
[11:59:05] <tom[]> chrisinajar: so what is doing this conversion to string? is it JQ
[11:59:08] <tom[]> ?
[11:59:10] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ mindtonic
[11:59:10] <bot-t> mindtonic, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[11:59:24] <chrisinajar> tom[]: nothing is converting it, i don't understand what you're getting at...
[11:59:34] <yogurt_truck> tom[]: the HTTP protocol?
[11:59:39] <chrisinajar> tom[]: did you want jquery to ammend the HTTP standards to include new datatypes?
[11:59:50] <mindtonic> Eviltwin: thanks
[12:00:04] <EAN407> sailboat: to be honest i am a bit dissapointed about this. i have a large project and i use alot of jquery. but drag & drop is really important for me and in this case (in this particular project) i am thinking about using another framework. because "simple" things need horrible hacks.
[12:00:09] <tom[]> yogurt_truck: protocols don't convert.
[12:00:21] <aminho> Eviltwin: thanks :)
[12:00:33] <yogurt_truck> tom[]: ok. the browser converts it, in order to be able to use the HTTP protocol.
[12:00:44] <EAN407> sailboat: the normal jquery still rules. you can tell me any good alternatives to jquery for drag & drop?
[12:00:50] <xp_prg> gnarf I am interested in learning how you used the inspector of chrome to find the slider variable in data from yesterday on http://jsfiddle.net/renXW/6/
[12:00:57] <Eviltwin> EAN407: "drag & drop" is pretty vague
[12:00:58] <tom[]> somehow,  boolean in JS ends up encoded in application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[12:01:07] <tom[]> and that string is given to HTTP
[12:01:09] <xp_prg> I have chrome open and I am ready to be a chrome padawan to your jedi js skills
[12:01:12] <chrisinajar> yes
[12:01:31] <chrisinajar> that's true, tom[]. again, what are you getting at? are you just flaming HTTP protocol or something?
[12:01:31] <Eviltwin> EAN407: It can refer to any number of different behaviors
[12:01:39] <tom[]> i'm concerned if this is browser specific, standard in JS or implemented in JQ
[12:01:50] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ xp_prg
[12:01:50] <bot-t> xp_prg, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[12:01:51] <tom[]> 'if it's the latter, then i can rely on it being consistent
[12:01:53] <Eviltwin> Have you been through that?
[12:01:53] <chrisinajar> tom[]: it's the same on every browser.
[12:01:58] <xp_prg> gnarf I try this using the result(fiddle.jshell.net) frame chosen: $("#privs").nextAll("div.ui-slider").data()
[12:02:18] <xp_prg> it gives error: TypeError: Cannot call method 'split' of undefined
[12:02:23] <EAN407> Eviltwin: in this case its just simple drag. if there is a image in the drag element AND delay or distance is set as option, drag wont work
[12:02:30] <tom[]> ok. thanks everyone
[12:02:34] <gnarf> xp_prg: old jQuery
[12:02:37] <gnarf> try jQuery 1.4
[12:02:41] <xp_prg> ok
[12:03:09] <gnarf> jQuery 1.3 doesn't allow .data()
[12:03:16] <xp_prg> it says null
[12:03:29] <xp_prg> oh wait, things didn't render right
[12:03:30] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/3Z2Z0R2w1h1F3x3t0s0e
[12:03:42] <gnarf> did you re-include jquery ui?
[12:03:57] <gnarf> xp_prg: jQuery 1.3 is like SUPER old
[12:04:06] <chrisinajar> yeah it is..
[12:04:40] <Eviltwin> 1.3 was releasted in January 2009
[12:04:43] <xp_prg> gnarf doesn't render right :( http://jsfiddle.net/renXW/7/
[12:05:27] <EAN407> Eviltwin: to be honest i am pretty new to js and js frameworks. but this is a really big bug... that simply disqualifys jquery for my actual project. i dont use draggable alot but i need it for this project :)
[12:05:37] <gnarf> xp_prg: you never checked jQuery UI again: http://jsfiddle.net/renXW/8/

[12:07:31] <sailboat> ahh I see not
[12:07:33] <sailboat> yay
[12:07:39] <chrisinajar> well, you are now..
[12:07:52] <EAN407> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/Ypxkg/ there you go. simple copy pasted the demo code and added 2 images
[12:07:58] <sailboat> EAN407: I think the problem is the browsers themselves
[12:08:13] <EAN407> sailboat: of course its the browsers.
[12:08:21] <sailboat> EAN407: if im not mistaken, the new version of jQuery is using internal functions that aren't supported by those browsers
[12:08:27] <xp_prg> gnarf that is weird I have the exact same thing
[12:08:28] <sailboat> EAN407: the solution is to use an older library
[12:08:50] <EAN407> sailboat: intresting. i gonna try that. but maybe gnarf finds something :)
[12:08:51] <Eviltwin> EAN407: Why are you using the distance and delay features?
[12:08:52] <sailboat> EAN407: people are trying to role out HTML5 and change standards
[12:09:00] <gnarf> EAN407: i don't see a bug there... whats the problem?
[12:09:21] <xp_prg> mine still gives that error
[12:09:25] <sailboat> EAN407: there probably isn't a bug guys, it's probably the fact that the newer libraries aren't supported by the browsers
[12:09:26] <EAN407> gnarf: in IE 6 7 8 the draggable doesnt work
[12:09:42] <gnarf> EAN407: oh, that explains it, i don't have IE
[12:09:52] <gnarf> someone with IE verify that?
[12:10:00] <sailboat> EAN407: it might not even work either, they simply just don't know how to handle the requests
[12:10:01] <EAN407> sailboat: i took a look at the bug tracker and there is a ticket... 2 years old. its the same problem
[12:10:03] <aminho> Eviltwin, those e,a,g,h,f,c,b,d are weird, the function seems to be called with only 4 parameters
[12:10:13] <gnarf> if its a bug, lets get it reported - http://jqbug.com/ui/new
[12:10:20] <sailboat> EAN407: where is this ticker?
[12:10:26] <xp_prg> gnarf I guess I am just cursed
[12:10:30] <gnarf> EAN407: whats the ticket?
[12:10:36] <EAN407> sailboat: in the bugreport some people wrote that putting _hughe_ invisible letters infront of the image make it work. but thats a really dirty hack
[12:10:44] <EAN407> gnarf: lets me google it again.
[12:11:19] <xp_prg> oh wait I didn't choose the right frame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[12:12:06] <gnarf> EAN407: we probably haven't bothered fixing it because those things are getting rewritten, and thats like a super edge case
[12:12:17] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: We normally ban people for using that many !s
[12:12:26] <xp_prg> gnarf got it to work!
[12:12:31] <gnarf> xp_prg: nice
[12:12:34] <xp_prg> I am confused how you knew that stop would be invoked with _stop
[12:13:06] <gnarf> xp_prg: i'm on the jQuery UI team, and I know the internals of the code base of jQuery and UI really really well
[12:13:14] <texinwien> xp_prg: 20 exclamation marks is the usual limit - you've got one too many there
[12:13:23] <chrisinajar> does this channel have any ops at all? it seems so unmanaged and chaotic... i guess that fits the language though......
[12:13:28] <xp_prg> can I pay a fine?
[12:13:37] <kborchers> gnarf: sure you do :P
[12:13:56] <chrisinajar> how fancy
[12:13:59] <texinwien> send me a beer and I'll forget about it
[12:14:01] <Eviltwin> We have ops
[12:14:01] <gnarf> chrisinajar: i'm an op, Eviltwin is an op, ajpiano is an op, prolly more i haven't tracked down
[12:14:02] <Eviltwin> In hiding
[12:14:10] <chrisinajar> Eviltwin: explains why you're so irrationally competent for this channel :P
[12:14:15] <Eviltwin> There are actually like 14 ops
[12:14:27] * xp_prg gives texinwien a beer
[12:14:34] <gnarf> kborchers is an op too
[12:14:38] * kborchers hides
[12:14:39] <texinwien> xp_prg++
[12:14:41] <gnarf> Eviltwin:  20 ops on the access list
[12:14:47] <texinwien> huh. no worky here
[12:15:02] <gnarf> Eviltwin: 1 of them is freenode staff, and another is a bot, but the rest are people ;)
[12:15:16] <gnarf> danheberden is an op too
[12:15:25] <xp_prg> gnarf there is one last problem I need to solve, there are multiple selectToUISlider instances on the page
[12:15:35] <gnarf> xp_prg: look out
[12:15:42] <xp_prg> I believe your approach of using .nextAll will invoke them all right?
[12:15:47] <gnarf> xp_prg: maybe
[12:16:07] <gnarf> xp_prg: like i was saying
[12:16:16] <gnarf> that plugin looks like a piece of crap from my pov
[12:16:25] <xp_prg> can I do something like $('#privs.ui-slider:eg[0]') ?
[12:16:34] <xp_prg> eg = eq
[12:16:37] <jeffreylevesque> anyone using 'innerfade'
[12:16:41] <jeffreylevesque> for their slideshows?
[12:16:57] <gnarf> xp_prg: yeah, but it might be easier to just find the .ui-slider's than dealing with the nextAll crap
[12:17:15] <xp_prg> right that is what I am trying to do
[12:17:20] <texinwien> $('#privs.ui-slider').eq(0) is better, I believe.
[12:17:30] <gnarf> texinwien: you believe correct
[12:17:40] <gnarf> but the #privs part of that selector is pretty much unnessecary
[12:17:42] <xp_prg> sweet thanks, I am starting to get it :>
[12:17:51] <texinwien> $('#privs.ui-slider').each(function () {//do your stuff};
[12:18:03] <texinwien> righto gnarf
[12:18:13] <xp_prg> texinwien but what is that doing .each ?
[12:18:13] <texinwien>  $('.ui-slider').each(function () {//do your stuff};
[12:18:26] <texinwien> it executes the function once for each slider
[12:18:27] <xp_prg> every match you do something with?
[12:18:48] <xp_prg> do you reference this to access what was matched?
[12:18:55] <texinwien> xp_prg: yes and yes.
[12:19:35] <EAN407> gnarf: thats one of the bug reports i guess http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7359
[12:20:30] <EAN407> gnarf: and in the bug report is also a link to this one http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4742
[12:22:00] <gnarf> EAN407: well 4742 is wrong, cuz that option seems to work perfectly fine for me in chrome
[12:22:37] <EAN407> gnarf: it works in chrome and in firefox well (use chrome mainly)
[12:23:04] <xp_prg> gnarf in chrome inspect how do I copy the css path of something?
[12:24:13] <chrisinajar> "css path"?
[12:24:21] <EAN407> gnarf: is there a particular reason why there are not comments on the demo pages like on the normal jquery. that would safe some people time :) like the img bug with IE
[12:24:21] <gnarf> xp_prg: by hand? :)
[12:24:39] <xp_prg> html > body > from#show-result >
[12:24:44] <gnarf> EAN407: not sure
[12:24:45] <xp_prg> in firebug you can just copy it
[12:24:56] <jkies00> hello all , quick selector question.  is there a way to 'remove all classes except this one'  ??  here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/DTYJx/
[12:25:05] <gnarf> xp_prg: i don't think there is a way to copy it in chrome
[12:25:18] <jkies00> i'd like to remove all the classes except for the 'marked-as' class
[12:25:28] <xp_prg> ok thanks gnarf, I heart you in a platonic and fiscally conservative way
[12:25:28] <gnarf> jkies00: .prop("className", "marked-as")
[12:25:29] <MIMi> Hi some one here?
[12:26:00] <gnarf> ?ask @MIMi
[12:26:00] <bot-t1> MIMi, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:26:25] <EAN407> gnarf: as far IE tells me this part is creating the "error" ( IE says access denied)  - if (sel.createRange) return sel.createRange();
[12:26:49] <gnarf> EAN407: patcheswelcome
[12:27:02] <EAN407> gnarf: patches?
[12:27:14] <gnarf> EAN407: fork jquery-ui, fix it, and send a pull request
[12:27:34] <gnarf> EAN407: its on the 1-8-stable branch tho, 1.9 rewrites draggable
[12:27:36] <MIMi> I want to trigger a function when each div with a specific class loads..I wrote something like this : $("div.chatItemOdd").load(function() {
[12:27:37] <MIMi> var inner = $(this).text();
[12:27:37] <MIMi> alert(inner);	
[12:27:37] <MIMi> });  but this doesnt seem to work. any suggestions?
[12:27:40] <EAN407> gnarf: i am a javascript noob and especial a jquery one. i dont think i can try to fit this hehe
[12:27:44] <gnarf> ?p @MIMi
[12:27:44] <bot-t1> MIMi, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:28:00] <gnarf> MIMi: don't drop multiple lines in an IRC room, bad karma
[12:28:17] <MIMi> sorry guys Im new to this IRC thing :)
[12:28:20] <gnarf> MIMi: also, you basically CANT do what you are asking
[12:28:30] <NoiseEee> MIMi: div's dont have a 'load' event
[12:28:36] <gnarf> MIMi: i assume you mean "as a new div is added to the dom"
[12:28:43] <gnarf> ?newContent @MIMi
[12:28:44] <bot-t1> MIMi, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[12:29:27] <MIMi> see guys Im writing a script for Tumblr and want to customize the chat lines
[12:29:38] <jkies00> thanks gnarf
[12:29:51] <MIMi> I want to do it for every div. something like the example here : http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:30:16] <NoiseEee> MIMi: when is a <div> "loaded" in your scenario?
[12:30:32] <MIMi> It's static
[12:30:39] <MIMi> it loads once andd finishes
[12:30:53] <MIMi> but actually the number of divs might be variable
[12:31:19] <Sir_Rai> Hiho
[12:31:32] <gnarf> EAN407: sorry then, I doubt that bug will be fixed before the rewrite in 1.9
[12:31:38] <NoiseEee> MIMi: it doesn't change the fact that a <div> has no load event
[12:32:00] <MIMi> does jquery have a function like Foreach
[12:32:09] <gnarf> ?each @mimi
[12:32:10] <bot-t1> mimi, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:32:14] <MIMi> that is does a thing for all the matches?
[12:32:37] <MIMi> oh thaanks bot-t1 , gnarf, NoiseEee
[12:32:44] <MIMi> I think my problem is solved
[12:32:53] <xp_prg> ok gnarf got a weird question, lets say I want to test if I am getting the right object, is there a way to get an object and tell the debug tools to highlight it?
[12:32:55] <Sir_Rai> How can I fix this function to slide up this msg box when clicked instead of time out? http://pastebin.com/wJuScnse
[12:33:19] <gnarf> xp_prg: inspect( element )
[12:33:19] <EAN407> gnarf: if you put the image in the background (background-image: ... ) it works. for future people who are asking this. but still. really strange behaviour :) how long do you think will it take till 1.9 will be released?
[12:33:29] <gnarf> EAN407: months
[12:34:15] <xp_prg> gnarf you remind me of snarf from thundercats
[12:34:33] <shadykhan> okay if i have some javascript rollover effects on an image for example how do i make it so if js is disabled it will go to the css hover effects?
[12:36:16] <NoiseEee> shadykhan: write the CSS as if there won't be an JS, and when your JS effects are on, overwrite the CSS/rule
[12:36:25] <gnarf> shadykhan: why not just use the CSS in the first place? :)
[12:36:36] <gnarf> most simple rollovers don't require JS nowadays
[12:36:40] <NoiseEee> and that ^^
[12:37:13] <gnarf> and even if you want to make sure to support them, you can write some oneline JS to toggleClass("hover") and write your CSS like .something:hover, .something.hover
[12:37:16] <shadykhan> i have a code interview bullcrap
[12:37:27] <shadykhan> so im just doing everything extra carefull
[12:37:50] <shadykhan> plus right now im having problems with the css i cant get the image sprites to work
[12:38:07] <sailboat> SUCCESS!! I got the response to work.  That dirty backend..
[12:38:18] <spikku> backends are dirty
[12:39:46] <sailboat> thanks chrisinajar, Eviltwin and lxsameer
[12:40:02] <lxsameer> sailboat: ;)
[12:41:30] <Chopps> is it possible to change class of certain element with jquery
[12:42:11] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know where I can get a jquery library similar to: http://nursing.jhu.edu/
[12:42:37] <jeffreylevesque> for the rotator
[12:42:42] <jeffreylevesque> on the homepage
[12:43:24] <oal> Does anyone know a slider like widget which can be used with many "slider heads" like the one here http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ ?
[12:43:58] <oal> For jquery ui ^
[12:44:32] <sailboat>  http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[12:44:36] <sailboat> whoops
[12:44:46] <sailboat> ...disregard that, putty error
[12:48:59] <spikku> Chopps yes
[12:49:14] <Chopps> how?
[12:49:29] <chrisinajar> Chopps: addClass, removeClass, toggleClass
[12:49:32] <z0n3d> how can i get the NAME of the selected option from a select element?
[12:49:35] <chrisinajar> Chopps: use hasClass for querying
[12:49:50] <chrisinajar> z0n3d: .attr('name', 'bvalue') ?
[12:50:27] <Chopps> thanks chrisinajar
[12:50:40] <chrisinajar> np
[12:50:41] <z0n3d> chrisinajar, it doesn't actually have a "name" attribute though. <select id="unitsSelect"><option value="3959">miles</option></select>
[12:50:47] <z0n3d> i want to get miles
[12:51:23] <chrisinajar> z0n3d: $("#unitsSelect>option").text()
[12:51:50] <z0n3d> chrisinajar, but if there are multiple options, will that give me the selected one?
[12:52:02] <z0n3d> or will i have to iterate over them and call is :selected
[12:52:16] <GranMal>  z0n3d: $("#unitsSelect>option:selected").text()
[12:52:28] <z0n3d> thx guys
[12:53:00] <GranMal> z0n3d: You should make use of your name attribute ... it's good practice
[12:57:58] <Topcat> Recommend a decent parallax plugin someone.

[13:05:53] <djnewbie> hey guys, so i'm trying to correct ill IE7 behavior that submits the form when enter is hit instead of firing the ajax click event (within a modal form). I had asked if anyone knew a way to check if a click event was defined on a button when clicked. THis is what i came up with, if anyone knows a better way I'd love to hear it. http://dpaste.com/687373/
[13:06:22] <gnarf> djnewbie: why not bind to form submit instead
[13:06:35] <djnewbie> same thing happens when i bind
[13:06:38] <djnewbie> ie sux
[13:06:56] <gnarf> you should't be binding click on your submit input
[13:07:07] <gnarf> you should be binding submit on the containing form
[13:07:44] <gnarf> djnewbie: also, never ever use .data( "events" ) in live code, its bad practice
[13:08:32] <xp_prg> got it to work on my main form, thanks again gnarf I feel the force that you have bestowed upon me, I shall turn away from the dark side
[13:10:26] <sk8ball> ok guys, say you have a regular templated site layout, with a header and footer that were the same, along with navigation menu, then you had a content div container you want to ease in for each section of the website via the nav menu..... the catch tho is instead of having all the divs/content on page
[13:10:29] <djnewbie> gnarf: is there something i can use instead of .data('events') ?
[13:10:40] <sk8ball> yoou want to have a seperate html file for each section of content
[13:10:55] <sk8ball> but want to achieve the same easing effect
[13:11:07] <djnewbie> this form submit function is global for every form on the site, so i dont have to manually add it for each and every one.
[13:11:09] <sk8ball> of animating the content div sliding over
[13:12:12] <Jonno_FTW> I have the code  $('option').click( function() { window.location = "/news/year/"+ $(this).text();});
[13:12:32] <Jonno_FTW> it works in firefox but not in chrome
[13:14:21] <gnarf> djnewbie: no, there isn't
[13:14:27] <gnarf> djnewbie: its bad practice
[13:14:49] <GranMal> sk8ball ... I'll give you a bit of a start
[13:15:15] <sk8ball> that'd be appreaciated
[13:18:06] <djnewbie> gnarf: ok, could you tell me why it's bad practice so i can contemplate?
[13:18:32] <gnarf> djnewbie: there is no sane reason you should ever need to inspect the bound events on an object, its bad design
[13:18:44] <gnarf> djnewbie: instead, try adding a class to things you've ajaxified
[13:18:47] <gnarf> or something like that
[13:18:57] <gnarf> or even storing information about it in data()
[13:19:10] <djnewbie> in the form. yeah i see how that would work
[13:19:20] <djnewbie> ok thx.
[13:19:23] <gnarf> djnewbie: caring about something as implementation specific as an event handler is coding yourself into a corner
[13:19:47] <gnarf> let alone the dependancy you add on jQuery not changing its event binding backend data store
[13:20:12] <gnarf> or someone like me fighting to remove .data( "events" ) from the public API anyway since it's hacked in the code
[13:21:28] <starsinmypockets> I'm using this script to update shipping address fields based on billing address fields.. http://pastebin.com/Pd8KxQLn
[13:21:56] <starsinmypockets> however, the country field is a select list, how can I set the default to United States... passing the string to .val() doesn't seem to work
[13:22:54] <GranMal> sk8ball: http://jsfiddle.net/rkellermeyer/9J9ad/
[13:24:05] <gnarf> starsinmypockets: is the option's value "US" ?
[13:24:18] <gnarf> starsinmypockets: cuz thats what .val() expects, is the value of the option, not the text displayed
[13:26:36] <sk8ball> granmal, actually i'm going for the sliding across and covering up the previous div/element animation
[13:26:48] <sk8ball> and i need the atual html file to change
[13:26:53] <sk8ball> actual
[13:27:01] <sk8ball> instead of having all the divs in the same fie
[13:27:02] <sk8ball> file
[13:27:13] <starsinmypockets> gnarf - that's the info I was looking for, I'll check the value thanks
[13:27:13] <gnarf> djnewbie: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/24e416dca36df4b182a612dba37f8b6cdaa25916
[13:27:14] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by dmethvin (2m, 2w ago): Fix #10588. For now, event voyeurism only merits the look of disapproval.If you are using `.data("events")` we would like to know how we can provide a documented interface that satisfies the need.
[13:27:21] <sk8ball> otherwise its going to screw my seo up
[13:28:09] <gustoneg1o> hi there.  Anyone experience problems with keyup bindings in IExplorer?
[13:28:31] <gustoneg1o> it doesn't seem to be firing for me
[13:28:40] <starsinmypockets> gnarf that does it thanks again
[13:29:15] <bribroder> hey guys, i'm having issues with this line: $("li input").attr("value","0").each(function() { do stuff });
[13:29:32] <bribroder> it "does stuff" on all parents, not just those with value=0
[13:29:53] <bribroder> any ideas?
[13:30:03] <silverwind> bribroder, That's because your line doesn't do what you think it does...
[13:30:07] <gustoneg1o> bribroder: I believe you are setting the value to 0 every time
[13:30:13] <silverwind> Indeed.
[13:30:22] <bribroder> oh, genius
[13:30:29] <bribroder> shall i go for an if statement then?
[13:31:10] <silverwind> bribroder, check .filter
[13:31:12] <gustoneg1o> bribroder: you want something $("li input").each( )
[13:31:22] <gustoneg1o> or filter
[13:33:14] <black_warlock> uff i cant let it work
[13:33:19] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/SUvP5/14/
[13:33:29] <black_warlock> i dont understand what i m doing wrong
[13:33:50] <gustoneg1o> is there a way I can test if why a keyup event is not being called?
[13:34:08] <black_warlock> yes put an alert
[13:34:30] <black_warlock> why ?
[13:34:31] <gustoneg1o> black_warlock: of course, the alert tells if the event is called or not
[13:34:35] <black_warlock> check the error console
[13:34:38] <gustoneg1o> but doesn't tell me why it wasn't called
[13:34:52] <gustoneg1o> I'm debugging IE , does it have an error console?
[13:34:52] <sodapop> which is the most used tooltip plugin ?
[13:35:13] <gustoneg1o> sodapop: I find tipTip to be pretty nice
[13:35:16] <sodapop> gustoneg1o, has some crappy "developer tools" app
[13:35:31] <black_warlock> gustoneg1o i dont get ya
[13:36:36] <gustoneg1o> black_warlock: I have a simple .bind("keyup", function() { alert("wtf");})
[13:36:56] <gustoneg1o> but, it's not being called when I type in the input on which I bind it
[13:37:30] <Jonno_FTW> so did no one have an answer for my question?
[13:37:51] <black_warlock> ah
[13:37:54] <black_warlock> rite
[13:38:03] <black_warlock> infact i said to see the console
[13:38:07] <black_warlock> :d
[13:38:25] <gustoneg1o> works on firefox and safari, just not IE
[13:40:37] <sodapop> F11 will bring up the console in ie8
[13:40:57] <chrisinajar> F12, you mean
[13:41:04] <chrisinajar> f11 is fullscreen
[13:41:37] <sodapop> yep 12 sorry
[13:41:47] <chrisinajar> same key on all 3, in fact :)
[13:41:47] <gustoneg1o> chrisinajar: sodapop , unfortunately, I'm debuggin some inhouse software based on IE
[13:42:02] <gustoneg1o> there is no console.
[13:42:15] <chrisinajar> wait, what?
[13:42:20] <gustoneg1o> is there a way I can attacha  function to all events
[13:42:29] <yoshie902a> hello
[13:42:37] <chrisinajar> you're using a custom browser based on IE, but it's IE, and it has no console?
[13:42:45] <gustoneg1o> chrisinajar: yeah
[13:42:48] <chrisinajar> quit your job immediately.
[13:42:49] <yoshie902a> Can anyone recommend a good jquery image slider?
[13:43:04] <gustoneg1o> chrisinajar: why do you say that?
[13:43:04] <silverwind> yoshie902a, nivoslider is the best imho
[13:43:07] <chrisinajar> gustoneg1o: go debug it in a real people browser
[13:43:22] <gustoneg1o> chrisinajar: unfortunately I can't
[13:43:33] <yoshie902a> silverwind: I found it, but can I edit the navigation button placement and look?
[13:43:33] <EAN407> general question for draggable elements. which mouse event shall i use for clicks on a draggable?
[13:43:40] <chrisinajar> gustoneg1o: use firebug lite
[13:43:51] <silverwind> yoshie902a, I was able to edit pretty much everything using CSS.
[13:43:51] <chrisinajar> EAN407: mousedown mouseup
[13:43:58] <gustoneg1o> chrisinajar: everythin works fine in firefox etc
[13:44:07] <chrisinajar> gustoneg1o: does it work in IE?
[13:44:14] <EAN407> chrisinajar: doesnt that event also fire on drop?
[13:44:42] <chrisinajar> EAN407: mouseup fires on drop, mousedown does not. they correlate directly to the physical mouse. down, drag, up.
[13:45:29] <EAN407> so mousedown should do the job if i want a draggable element also clickable right?
[13:45:50] <chrisinajar> i dunno, you tell me
[13:45:50] <yoshie902a> silverwind: how do you specify the theme?
[13:46:06] <chrisinajar> EAN407: click will fire when they release the drag
[13:46:19] <chrisinajar> EAN407: click is only defined as "mousedown and then up on the same element"
[13:47:46] <chrisinajar> oohh, mouse event for clicks
[13:47:48] <chrisinajar> i see what you mean now
[13:47:53] <chrisinajar> sorry, i read your question wrong
[13:49:00] <chrisinajar> EAN407: store in your mousedown function the location, on mouseup compare the two values, if they haven't changed count it as a click
[13:49:04] <chrisinajar> that's how i did it
[13:50:09] <EAN407> chrisinajar: i guess plus minus some pixels right? or do you use the same pixel values?
[13:51:59] <chrisinajar> EAN407: i use a distance thingy, the deadzone thing where you have to drag it a little bit before it actually starts dragging
[13:52:16] <chrisinajar> so i check the exact pixels, because assuming they're within that distance then the pixels should be exactly the same.
[13:52:34] <chrisinajar> mine also only moves vertically, so the check was easier :P
[13:53:39] <mwmnj_> Hi I am a total noob and im trying to get jquery ui to work
[13:54:04] <mwmnj_> What im trying to accomplish are the tabs that this guy shows you how to do in literally 3 minutes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBjMG4H3MFc
[13:54:19] <mwmnj_> Here is my html code: http://pastebin.com/wtURVVMn
[13:54:34] <mwmnj_> and here is where I am getting my js links: http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#Libraries
[13:54:47] <mwmnj_> and here is where I am getting m css links: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1348559/are-there-hosted-jquery-ui-themes-anywhere
[13:55:00] <djnewbie> gnarf: thx man!
[13:55:07] <mwmnj_> Anyone willing to help me out real quick?
[13:55:26] <chrisinajar> mwmnj_: get it into jsfiddle.net and i'll take a look
[13:55:47] <gnarf> ?demo
[13:55:48] <bot-t1> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[13:56:00] <chrisinajar> ohh, that's a great factoid :D
[13:56:01] <bribroder> thanks guys, i solved it with a little more headsmashing
[13:56:17] <mwmnj_> chrisinajar: http://jsfiddle.net/
[13:56:20] <mwmnj_> There ya go
[13:56:23] <gnarf> mwmnj_: you might have an issue with using 1.8.16 jquery ui without first using jquery
[13:56:39] <chrisinajar> bribroder: web development is 80% headsmashing, facepalming, and foreheaddesking
[13:56:47] <gnarf> also mwmnj_ - you are using 1.7.2 of the themes, with version 1.8.16 of jquery ui
[13:56:54] <chrisinajar> mwmnj_: try again, that's empty :P
[13:56:59] <supsup> anyone have chrome crash when u go to http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects
[13:57:08] <chrisinajar> mwmnj_: make sure you press save
[13:57:13] <mwmnj_> http://jsfiddle.net/z9geV/
[13:57:15] <janthony> Is there a jquery function for when you click in a field that already has text pre-loaded in it, it will clear the field. If you type text it keeps that text, but nothing is typed, it restores the original text that was there before you clicked inside the field?
[13:57:19] <mwmnj_> Sorry!
[13:57:23] <mwmnj_> That link should work
[13:57:26] <gnarf> step 1) include jQuery, step 2) include UI (once, not twice), step 3) include the themes for the same version of ui you are using
[13:57:27] <chrisinajar> supsup: try disabling some of your plugins
[13:57:39] <gnarf> mwmnj_: ^^
[13:57:53] <mwmnj_> gnarf: by "themes" you mean css
[13:58:11] <gnarf> mwmnj_: i mean the "themes" package from jQuery UI
[13:58:15] <mwmnj_> gnarf: (hopefully that Q gives you an understanfing of my noob level lol)
[13:58:15] <gnarf> which is css
[13:58:22] <chrisinajar> mwmnj_: you may want to read some basic tutorials on javascript/css first
[13:59:14] <gnarf> you need jquery.min.js (preferably 1.7.1) to load jquery-ui.min.js (preferably 1.8.17) and then load jquery-ui.css ( the same version of ui.js )
[14:00:04] <mwmnj_> chrisinajar: yea, I have some resources bookmarked, any reccommendations appreciated
[14:00:14] <supsup> chrisnajar : thanks that's what it was.
[14:00:17] <mwmnj_> gnarf: so its  a linking problem?
[14:01:07] <mwmnj_> gnarf: cause the js links are right off the google site, so the css must be wrong but i couldnt find it anywhere else
[14:02:18] <mwmnj_> Does anyone know where the correct links are?
[14:02:47] <chrisinajar> mwmnj_: for jquery uio?
[14:02:53] <chrisinajar> without an o at the end
[14:03:33] <mwmnj_> chrisinajar: im not 100% on either of the 3 links
[14:03:57] <mwmnj_> chrisinajar: im trying to use jquer ui, so I need jquery + jquery ui + jquer ui css
[14:04:01] <d4rklit3> hi
[14:04:08] <mwmnj_> I think At least
[14:04:25] <gnarf> mwmnj_: read the tags, you are including ui twice ( once minified, once not )
[14:05:08] <mwmnj_> gnarf: ahh i see
[14:05:25] <gnarf> mwmnj_: change the first to be an include for jQuery
[14:05:34] <khmer_> after a long discussion about browser support, my co-worker gave me this
[14:05:42] <khmer_> http://colonpipe.org/fuie7.jpg
[14:05:55] <khmer_> ahem
[14:05:57] <khmer_> http://colonpipe.org/fuie7.gif
[14:06:04] <mwmnj_> gnarf: yup that did it
[14:06:07] <mwmnj_> Thanks!
[14:06:34] <mwmnj_> only I dont think i have the script correct
[14:06:40] <mwmnj_> Cause there isnt functionality
[14:07:01] <dreipeh> exit
[14:07:03] <d4rklit3> i have an odd problem, imagine if you will i have a scrolling jquery site that consists of several divs in floating left to create a long div. the nav on top scrolls them left and right. one of these divs has a iframe that loads a canvas and does some of its own scroling where you click and drag a parallax panorama. however if the mouse leaves the iframe and hits the body of the main document it starts scrolling that main div with all the sections in it. Let me
[14:07:03] <d4rklit3>  know if i should try to clarify more.
[14:07:16] <mwmnj_> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/4aMTH/
[14:18:08] <yoshie902a> what's the difference between jquery.nivo.slider.js and jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js?
[14:18:57] <silverwind> yoshie902a, open them with a text editor....
[14:18:58] <Eviltwin> yoshie902a: One has probably been minified
[14:19:04] <Eviltwin> To use as few characters as possible
[14:19:13] <Eviltwin> While still doing effectively the same thing
[14:19:18] <Eviltwin> i.e. what you would use in production
[14:19:43] <yoshie902a> Eviltwin: the pack looked compressed, but I was not sure if that was the only difference.
[14:26:45] <NoiseEee> so, this is obviously intended behaviour: http://jsfiddle.net/cgc6B/
[14:26:53] <NoiseEee> meh fail.
[14:26:54] <NoiseEee> sorry.
[14:29:17] <mwmnj_> I am trying to implement this bit of jquery ui: http://jsfiddle.net/6dPrD/3/
[14:29:32] <mwmnj_> On this website: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10733561/H%26SP/H%26SP.html
[14:30:00] <mwmnj_> Do I need to host the css locally and modify it to fit my theme or what?
[14:30:14] <gnarf> mwmnj_: you can
[14:30:30] <gnarf> mwmnj_: you might also be able to themeroller yourself a theme with the right colors easier
[14:30:52] <mwmnj_> gnarf: or can I just like modify it in my own css and just have it go over the css from jquery ui
[14:31:01] <gnarf> mwmnj_: correct
[14:31:06] <gnarf> mwmnj_: but like if you just want tabs
[14:31:14] <gnarf> and you don't want all the jquery ui fluf
[14:31:20] <gnarf> css wise
[14:31:26] <mwmnj_> gnarf: basically I just want the layout to remain the same it is and just have that white space expand and contract with each tab
[14:31:34] <gnarf> you could write a simpler tabs using a few lines of basic jquery
[14:32:08] <mwmnj_> gnarf: hows that?
[14:32:20] <mwmnj_> gnarf: this seemed like the simplest solution
[14:33:05] <gnarf> making ui tabs fit your css is probably harder than writing the jquery
[14:33:51] <silverwind> That's why jquery-ui is so bad..
[14:34:03] <mwmnj_> gnarf: ok, do you have a link to where I should start?
[14:35:25] <gnarf> ?learn
[14:35:26] <bot-t1> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:37:32] <mwmnj_> learn?
[14:37:33] <gnarf> mwmnj_: but i mean, you're more than welcome to look at the tabs from ui and do css changes too
[14:38:23] <gnarf> mwmnj_: you basically want to bind to clicks on the $("nav a") and .hide() or .show() the proper divs from the content area
[14:39:48] <gnarf> var tabs = $("#content").children().hide(); tabs.eq(0).show(); $("nav a").click(function( event ) { tabs.hide().filter( this.hash ).show(); event.preventDefault() });
[14:40:41] <gnarf> that would hide all the divs inside of #content, and then show the first one - then when you click on a "nav a" it would hide all the tabs and find the one matching the "hash" of the href "#about" i.e. and show it

[15:17:49] <EAN407> gnarf:  the little img issue with dragable is not such a big deal because the click functions work perfect on the draggable. may i suggest that there will be a note on the ui page because that drives alot of people crazy as i can read on the internet. and sometimes it takes them ages to find out the issue

[15:35:47] <mwmnj_> http://jsfiddle.net/6dPrD/6/
[15:35:58] <mwmnj_> Got it from this page: http://www.sunsean.com/idTabs/
[15:36:08] <mwmnj_> Do I need to inclue the jquery link?
[15:38:40] <rummik> Um, well, mwmnj_, you don't need the <script>...</script> wrapping
[15:39:13] * cwillu_at_work wonders why $("input[name=someSpecificOne]").select() doesn't select the contents, but $("input[name=someSpecificOne]")[0].select() does
[15:39:18] <rummik> mwmnj_: And you need to include the idTabs plugin
[15:39:36] <mwmnj_> jquery
[15:39:37] <mwmnj_> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[15:39:47] <mwmnj_> http://jsfiddle.net/6dPrD/10/
[15:41:21] <rummik> mwmnj_: JSfiddle includes jQuery for you.  You need to include the idTabs plugin
[15:42:58] <mwmnj_> rummik: this javascrip? http://www.sunsean.com/idTabs/jquery.idTabs.min.js
[15:43:05] <rummik> mwmnj_: Yes
[15:43:38] <mwmnj_> rummik: how would I implement that in js fiddle?
[15:44:35] <mwmnj_> rummik: like so? http://jsfiddle.net/6dPrD/12/
[15:45:00] <rummik> mwmnj_: Exactly!
[15:45:08] <rummik> mwmnj_: And it appears to be working, too :P
[15:45:27] <mwmnj_> rummik: not for me?
[15:45:36] <mwmnj_> rummik: you mean the functionality working
[15:45:52] <mwmnj_> rummik: the style I have to actually implement in .css?
[15:46:00] <mwmnj_> rummik: or is the css working for you also?
[15:46:21] <rummik> mwmnj_: Not seeing any styling, but there isn't anything in the CSS box
[15:46:33] <rummik> mwmnj_: Functionally, it seems to work fine though
[15:46:50] <mwmnj_> rummik: there are style= in the html
[15:47:06] <rummik> mwmnj_: Ah.  Yeah, that's working too
[15:47:26] <mwmnj_> Why isnt it appeearing as it is shown here: http://www.sunsean.com/idTabs/
[15:47:28] <HexSquid> Here's a curious thing. I cannot recreate it in jsfiddle. Go to jquery.com with both Firefox and Chrome and run the following in your console 3 times
[15:47:29] <HexSquid> $('body').empty().append('<input type="radio" name="a" checked="checked"><input type="radio" name="a">');
[15:48:03] <HexSquid> The first two times the radio button is checked, then the third time it is unchecked. Firefox does not do this
[15:48:24] <rummik> mwmnj_: That's not something the CSS in the HTML does
[15:49:02] <rummik> mwmnj_: That's probably part of a stylesheet on the site there
[15:49:21] <mwmnj_> rummik: ah ok
[15:49:24] <mwmnj_> rummik: thanks
[15:49:39] <rummik> mwmnj_: np
[15:50:12] <rummik> HexSquid: That's an odd one O.o
[15:50:21] <HexSquid> Any ideas?
[15:54:01] <rummik> HexSquid: I can reproduce it in JSfiddle
[15:54:13] <rummik> HexSquid: http://jsfiddle.net/rummik/4yt6E/
[15:54:15] <HexSquid> Really? That's what I tried first
[15:54:44] <rummik> Yup
[15:55:41] <HexSquid> Yep that recreates well. How bizzarre
[15:56:07] <Karai> Hey, I'm having a bit of trouble with the jQuery-ui slider. I'm trying to make a seek bar for an audio tag and it largely works but for some reason it is ignoring the ui-slider-range and only updating ui-slider-handle's value

[16:00:00] <patrick99e99> I read somewhere online to make the window scroll to an element, do:  $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: element.top() }, 1000)...  My question is, what's with the "html, body" ?
[16:00:05] <patrick99e99> why two elements?
[16:08:39] <Zauberfisch> I am having troubles with IE and html returned as json to an ajax request

[16:09:06] <Zauberfisch> <label>something</label>\n\t<label>something else</label>\n\t
[16:09:11] <Zauberfisch> should come out
[16:09:14] <Zauberfisch> but IE gets:
[16:09:23] <Zauberfisch> something</label>\n\tsomething else</label>\n\t
[16:10:16] <Zauberfisch> code is here: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/jquery.fileupload.js#L536
[16:11:07] <Zauberfisch> result is the json object, { buttons: '<label> ...', someOther: stuff }
[16:14:28] <whoever> hi all, is there an option to autoclose the select widow that appears on mobile devices when a selection is made ,  instead of manulay having to close the window after making the selection
[16:14:42] <Zauberfisch> tested it in ie 7-9
[16:14:48] <Zauberfisch> same problem in all of them
[16:14:52] <Zauberfisch> works fine in ff and chrome
[16:15:41] <Zauberfisch> whoever you are talking about a <select>?
[16:15:54] <whoever> Zauberfisch: yes
[16:16:00] <Zauberfisch> try $('select').blur()
[16:16:43] <whoever> Zauberfisch: .close after .blue or just .blur
[16:18:33] <Zauberfisch> whoever http://jsfiddle.net/eujpv/
[16:20:14] <Zauberfisch> whoever so you can bind to onChange and trigger .blur()
[16:20:24] <Zauberfisch> i guess that could work
[16:23:42] <imsky> HNNNNGGGHH

[16:33:30] <whoever> Zauberfisch: that didn't work, at least for droid, when i madea selection with you jsfiddle example the select window stayed open at the botton untill i manually closed it
[16:34:09] <Zauberfisch> whoever you are sure you opend it within the 3000ms?
[16:37:11] <whoever> Zauberfisch: i believe so i make a selection and the dark blue select box at the botton stays open and the value in the select on the screen changes
[16:37:40] <Zauberfisch> whoever just to be sure, make the 3000 to 5000 or 10000
[16:40:18] <whoever> Zauberfisch:  still no change
[16:40:29] <Zauberfisch> hmm, sorry, then i have no idea
[16:40:56] <whoever> Zauberfisch: thx for givin' it a shot
[16:45:59] <black_warlock> guys
[16:46:00] <Eviltwin> Zauberfisch: What's going on>
[16:47:10] <Zauberfisch> I am having troubles with IE and html in a json response, and whoever wants to auto close a open <select> on an android browser
[16:49:53] <domino14> if i insert a <input type="checkbox" checked=""> into the dom with jquery, it seems that it checks it anyway
[16:49:59] <domino14> even though  the checked attribute is set to ""
[16:50:09] <domino14> i have to remove the checked attribute entirely to not set it
[16:50:10] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ domino14
[16:50:11] <bot-t1> domino14, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[16:50:18] <Eviltwin> Then remove it entirely
[16:50:34] <domino14> is that in the spec?
[16:50:43] <Eviltwin> I believe so
[16:50:51] <Eviltwin> Existence of the attr means checked
[16:50:53] <Eviltwin> vs not
[16:51:20] <Eviltwin> Like <input type="checkbox checked>
[16:51:39] <black_warlock> infact why checked=""
[16:51:47] <black_warlock> its not correct
[16:52:01] <Eviltwin> "Checkboxes (and radio buttons) are on/off switches that may be toggled by the user. A switch is "on" when the control element's checked attribute is set."
[16:52:15] <Eviltwin> Some people come from checked="checked"
[16:52:21] <black_warlock> you have to set value
[16:52:21] <Eviltwin> 'Cause I think old IEs used that
[16:52:21] <domino14> but in jquery i can do .attr('checked', '') and it'll uncheck it
[16:52:26] <black_warlock> if checked
[16:53:05] <domino14> so i can uncheck it with .attr('checked', '') but if i actually do checked="" that's differnet behavior?
[16:53:05] <black_warlock> <input type="checkbox" value="1" checked>
[16:53:18] <Eviltwin> Use .prop
[16:53:22] <Eviltwin> As it is a property
[16:53:26] <black_warlock> and value indicates the value the input gets if its checked
[16:53:27] <Eviltwin> That you want to change
[17:00:58] <black_warlock> how can i change the text automatically if the <li> got an <ul> inside ?

[17:01:48] <black_warlock> just trying to add thos characters '>>>>>'
[17:02:05] <sviatovigt> I'm using jquery-ui tabs
[17:02:06] <black_warlock> if its present an ul
[17:02:47] <sviatovigt> but I don't know how to configure the tabs so that after a refresh to remain on the same tab
[17:02:53] <sviatovigt> cand anyone help me?
[17:03:37] <black_warlock> use the cookies ?
[17:04:20] <sviatovigt> yes, I do use cookies... but... is there any other method without cookies
[17:04:37] <sviatovigt> cookies may not allow me to use bookmarks
[17:05:23] <black_warlock> you can check the opened url with the href
[17:05:46] <sviatovigt> can you please give me more details?
[17:05:49] <black_warlock> make a split
[17:05:55] <sviatovigt> I thought it's something simple
[17:06:00] <black_warlock> its not
[17:06:02] <sviatovigt> a configuration or something
[17:06:08] <sviatovigt> ok
[17:06:29] <sviatovigt> so probably I will have to add some code to detect the opened tab...
[17:06:30] <black_warlock> i dont get what refresh you do ?
[17:06:49] <sviatovigt> for example I have four tabs
[17:06:50] <black_warlock> if tabs are configured to open some contents in the same div
[17:07:04] <sviatovigt> I'm on the second tab
[17:07:06] <black_warlock> there will not be any refresh to make
[17:07:11] <sviatovigt> and I reload the page
[17:07:22] <sviatovigt> the page will open on the first tab
[17:07:37] <sviatovigt> in one of the tabs I have a form
[17:07:56] <sviatovigt> after I submit the form I want to get back on the same tab
[17:07:58] <black_warlock> are you using html pages or dyna pages ?
[17:08:23] <sviatovigt> html
[17:09:56] <black_warlock> you cna use only cookies
[17:10:06] <sviatovigt> :(
[17:10:10] <black_warlock> must store the last checked tab
[17:11:15] <black_warlock> and make a function that check each value in the tab , if it find corrispondence it will be setted with the css OPENED
[17:11:31] <sviatovigt> this
[17:11:35] <sviatovigt> thank you
[17:11:47] <black_warlock> its not hard just register the name of page or assign numbers
[17:11:50] <sviatovigt> I will try to modify it so that it will not use cookies
[17:12:05] <sviatovigt> it seems... imposible for me
[17:12:21] <sviatovigt> *impossible
[17:12:36] <sviatovigt> I will do it old school
[17:13:47] <black_warlock> aff come on its easy lol
[17:14:10] <sviatovigt> for someone who knows... :(
[17:14:50] <black_warlock> download the cookie library
[17:14:55] <black_warlock> for jquery
[17:15:06] <black_warlock> its not included in the normal lib
[17:15:13] <sviatovigt> thank you for your help
[17:15:16] <sviatovigt> but believe me
[17:15:24] <sviatovigt> it's a waste of time for me
[17:15:30] <black_warlock> it takes 3 mins lol
[17:15:42] <sviatovigt> 3 minutes to donwload
[17:15:48] <sviatovigt> 3 months to learn
[17:15:49] <sviatovigt> :)
[17:16:05] <sviatovigt> I will attach links to each tabs
[17:16:13] <sviatovigt> it's easier
[17:17:02] <black_warlock> man
[17:17:03] <black_warlock> wtf
[17:17:14] <black_warlock> there is already a fookin tab ui with cookies
[17:17:25] <black_warlock> they already made it
[17:17:26] <black_warlock> lol
[17:17:35] <black_warlock> watch there
[17:17:40] <black_warlock> on the right menu
[17:17:43] <black_warlock> the last voice
[17:17:50] <black_warlock> EXAMPLES WITH COOKIES PERSISTANCE
[17:18:03] <black_warlock> you must be crazy its done alr :P
[17:19:11] <black_warlock> Looks the same as the default demo, but uses cookie to store the selected tab, and restore it when the page (re)loads. The cookie is stored for a day, so tabs will be restored even after closing the browser. Use cookie: {} for using cookies with default options.
[17:19:26] <black_warlock> mad :P
[17:20:51] <black_warlock> sveisvei did you see it ?
[17:21:03] <sviatovigt> I'm looking at it
[17:23:27] <torbjorn> how can I find the <table> element of a given <td> element?
[17:24:01] <black_warlock> with .closest()
[17:24:34] <black_warlock> with .closest('table').first()
[17:24:44] <torbjorn> thanks!
[17:25:11] <black_warlock> is it right Eviltwin ?
[17:26:53] <black_warlock> closest its enough if there is only one table
[17:28:49] <sviatovigt> black_warlock: i have an error using the example for cookie persistance
[17:29:00] <sviatovigt> Error: d.cookie is undefined
[17:29:07] <sviatovigt> Error: d.cookie is undefined
[17:29:33] <sviatovigt> I suppose I need that cookie library
[17:29:38] <sviatovigt> that you told me about
[17:29:49] <sviatovigt> but I can't realy find it
[17:29:54] <eternalsword> I've found a bug in webkit which results in incorrect setting of height when the browser is zoomed it. test at http://eternalsword.com/webkitbug/zoom-set-height-test and workaround at http://eternalsword.com/webkitbug/zoom-set-height-workaround  Question is, would the workaround be something that should be done in core?
[17:31:59] <Botnet> yo
[17:41:15] <whoever> hi all, is there an option to autoclose the select widow that appears on mobile devices when a selection is made ,  instead of manulay having to close the window after making the selection
[17:41:45] <whoever> i have tried .blur() but no luck
[17:43:01] <black_warlock> sviatovigt you have to download the plugin
[17:43:35] <black_warlock> you can add cookie to jq main file ar can add as different file
[17:43:50] <black_warlock> bu its separated plugin
[17:45:50] <black_warlock> i got it want it ?
[17:46:10] <black_warlock> looks like they are updating it
[17:46:55] <felixp> hey
[17:47:16] <black_warlock> http://webservicetec.com/jquery.cookie.js
[17:47:26] <black_warlock> this is the file you need to add
[17:47:32] <felixp> i've got jquery ui portlets... and when i'm trying to select some text in the portlet-content, it drags the portlet... any ideas?
[17:47:36] <black_warlock> to let cookie works in jquery
[17:48:33] <black_warlock> sviatovigt there the library
[17:49:39] <shesek> whoever, atleast on Android, I don't think so
[17:49:49] <shesek> I tried some stuff the other day, couldn't get it to work
[17:51:03] <whoever> shesek: i don't think there is at or or it at the ios level not at browser
[17:51:36] <black_warlock> i think you can close all the UL tags apart the first ?
[17:51:40] <black_warlock> is it a menu ?
[17:51:46] <shesek> whoever, I'm sorry, I can't parse that sentence oO
[17:51:58] <sviatovigt> thank you black_warlock
[17:52:06] <sviatovigt> I was out for a cigarette
[17:52:08] <sviatovigt> :D
[17:52:14] <whoever> shesek: i tried .close(), .blur() and nothing
[17:52:18] <sodapop> i am opening a dialog with url content using .load it loads fine but the page loads a bit scrolled down
[17:53:29] <whoever> shesek: i don't think there is a way to controle it on any mobile device , and wheather or not the select closes on selection is controlled by the os of the device
[17:53:53] <whoever> sviatovigt: cigarettes a bad
[17:53:59] <black_warlock> sviatovigt you know how to add that lib right ?
[17:54:13] <shesek> sviatovigt, mmmmmk?
[17:54:15] <whoever> sviatovigt:  ... cigars ar better
[17:54:43] <shesek> whoever, still, you could expect the DOM API to somehow expose you a way to do that
[17:55:19] <sviatovigt> shese?
[17:55:29] <sviatovigt> shesek: ?
[17:55:38] <whoever> shesek: true
[17:56:05] <shesek> sviatovigt, I was continuing whoever... you know, "cigarettes are bad, mmmmk?"
[17:56:14] <sviatovigt> black_warlock: yes, I do
[17:56:21] <black_warlock> sombody knows how can i check if there is a particular tag inside another tag ?
[17:56:42] <whoever> shesek: is there a chance #android could answer or are they all about android dev not web ui
[17:57:07] <shesek> whoever, I don't think so, but it doesn't hurt to try
[17:57:27] <sviatovigt> whoever: ...I do not have time for cigars
[17:57:33] <sviatovigt> but you're right
[17:59:11] <felixp> i've got jquery ui portlets... and when i'm trying to select some text in the portlet-content, it drags the portlet... any ideas?
[18:00:41] <whoever> sviatovigt: well make time , or you can cut them in 1/4
[18:00:54] <whoever> shesek: asking in android
[18:02:00] <shesek> whoever, cut them in four? he can just partially smoke them every time
[18:02:04] <shesek> people do do that
[18:11:08] <whoever> shesek: doesn't look like you can program that action, I tried somethings on an ipod and even though it hadles selecs differently than android , you still can't auto close it
[18:11:21] * muzone is now playing: Rhodes Ahead (http://home.no/dwaynie/rhodes_ahead.mp3)
[18:11:45] <whoever> shesek: is there a way to not have the action take place untill the select is closed
[18:12:17] <whoever> shesek: or whould that just be .clidc instead of .change
[18:31:49] <whoever> shesek: well he needs to quit beeing such a girl about it and just suck it up
[18:32:39] <shesek> your client/boss?
[19:18:50] <fabiobik> hi´
[19:19:03] <fabiobik> how to count repeated values on array?
[19:20:54] <Matiasu> Hey guys!
[19:21:19] <jcblitz> I have a form that is loaded from a jQuery $.get call. That form uses an ajax submit and I would like to trigger event after that. Here is my code, http://pastebin.com/HGiHuk02, but it's not working. My guess is that initial $("#new_social_medium").on isn't binding to the form because it doesn't exist on the initial document load. Is there a different approach to get this to work?
[19:22:52] <Matiasu> I have a menu with a button. if you click it a submenu with many items is shown. I attached a click handler so that when the button is clicked the submenu is shown and another handler to the blur event so it's hidden again. the problem is that the blur event is triggered before the click in any of the items within the submenu so you can never click them because it's hidden just before you actually click them. any idea? I don't
[19:22:53] <Matiasu>  know how to fix that
[19:26:10] <Matiasu> ? delegate @ jcblitz
[19:26:11] <bot-t1> jcblitz, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[19:26:49] <jcblitz> I thought delegate and .on where the same more or less?
[19:27:01] <Matiasu> no
[19:27:08] <Matiasu> "now or in the future"
[19:27:18] <jcblitz> ah, must have overlooked that, thanks
[19:28:29] <jcblitz> actually, this is in the API: "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method. "
[19:29:12] <Matiasu> ?on
[19:29:13] <bot-t1> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:29:29] <Matiasu> lets see the implementation then
[19:30:05] <jcblitz> If you're asking for my snippet, http://pastebin.com/HGiHuk02
[19:31:22] <Matiasu> no, I mean, delegate implementation
[19:31:44] <Matiasu> you're right
[19:31:49] <Matiasu> delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) {
[19:31:49] <Matiasu> 		return this.on( types, selector, data, fn );
[19:31:49] <Matiasu> 	},
[19:32:00] <Matiasu> then your code should work
[19:32:23] <Matiasu> note that it's no the same as using .click()
[19:32:34] <jcblitz> hrrrm, I'll keep debugging then
[19:33:24] <Matiasu> ?live
[19:33:24] <bot-t1> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[19:33:41] <theBrettman> who wants to write the next best jquery plugin that will be worshiped for eternity?
[19:34:25] <jcblitz> Live has been replaced too. "As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. "
[19:35:28] <theBrettman> cpan has a library called css::simple that can read/write/update css files. we need this in jquery!
[19:35:48] <zivester> if I attach a .click() to an href, is there a way to see what that function is through firebug?
[19:36:03] <zivester> to an anchor*
[19:38:13] <theBrettman> ohwell, how hard can it be? right?
[19:38:40] <theBrettman> I will be famous in jquery land
[19:42:53] <VooDooNOFX_> I'm using my first jQuery addon today, but it has no documentation on usage. Can anyone tell me how I can access it or how I should invoke it? https://github.com/bcollins/jquery.bytesize/blob/master/jquery.bytesize.js
[19:43:45] <theBrettman> ok, maybe someone did beat me to it but it's in javascript, not jquery...
[19:44:06] <shesek> theBrettman, what does jQuery has to do with it?
[19:44:26] <shesek> jQuery is a library for DOM manipulation, effects and AJAX
[19:45:04] <shesek> VooDooNOFX_, $(...).bytesize() ?
[19:45:53] <VooDooNOFX_> typeof $().bytesize shows function, but typeof $().bytesize() returns undefined
[19:46:05] <shesek> VooDooNOFX_, $(...).bytesize(options), options being `unit` (default to B, for bytes) and standard (defaults to IEC, can be SI)
[19:46:26] <shesek> VooDooNOFX_, what are you expecting it to return?
[19:46:54] <shesek> it should return the jQuery object, to make chaining possible... but other than that, it modified the DOM elements themselves
[19:47:47] <VooDooNOFX_> a formatted byte. ex, bytesize(1234567890) should return '1.23 TB'
[19:49:47] <VooDooNOFX_> shesek, ah, so i'm not going to be able to call the function on a tickFormatter to Flot, right?
[19:50:28] <VooDooNOFX_> something like tickFormatter: function(val, axis) {return $().bytesize(val);} ?
[19:51:17] <shesek> VooDooNOFX_, the indented use, as far as I see, is having a DOM element like <span id="foo">1234567890</span>, than calling $('#foo').bytesize() to make it display "1.23TB" instead of "1234567890"
[19:51:49] <shesek> If you just want a function that knows how to make those transformations, you'll probably be better off finding another library (and don't add 'jquery' to the search this time, this has nothing to do with it)
[19:52:15] <VooDooNOFX_> shesek, indeed. thanks for your help! :)
[19:52:55] <shesek> VooDooNOFX_, you could just expose those formatSI and formatIEC, tho
[19:53:11] <VooDooNOFX_> how could I expose them in that script?
[19:53:24] <shesek> `window.formatIEC = formatIEC; window.formatSI = formatSI; ` would do that
[19:53:41] <shesek> or, you can (and should) probably just copy the functions near the end of the file to a separate file and use that
[19:54:11] <shesek> that is, if you don't need the actual intended use of the library
[20:05:16] <VooDooNOFX_> shesek, thanks. Ripping out the needed funtion worked for now. I'll email the author and ask him to update his githib with some new functions :)
[20:06:31] <shesek> VooDooNOFX_, the lesson: you shouldn't look for jquery-specific libraries when its not a jquery-specific task
[20:06:52] <shesek> that also goes at you, theBrettman :-)
[20:07:32] <Matiasu> I have a menu with a button. if you click it a submenu with many items is shown. I attached a click handler so that when the button is clicked the submenu is shown and another handler to the blur event so it's hidden again. the problem is that the blur event is triggered before the click in any of the items within the submenu so you can never click them because it's hidden just before you actually click them. any idea?
[20:08:59] <Matiasu> I need to somehow delay the the blur event in the button until the click event in the submenu is triggered
[20:09:10] <shesek> Matiasu, hmm
[20:09:25] <shesek> won't it be better to use a mouseout event on the submenu?
[20:09:37] <Matiasu> no, mouseout != click
[20:10:25] <Matiasu> the idea is: you click the button, the submenu appears, here you have two options: you click a subitem or you click outside so the submenu is hidden
[20:10:31] <Matiasu> shesek
[20:11:26] <Matiasu> I think it's the normal behavior for any menu with submenus, I wonder how they do that
[20:12:17] <Matiasu> for example google does that in toolbar, you click the gear icon and a submenu appears, if you click outside it's hidden
[20:12:27] <Matiasu> in their toolbar*
[20:13:10] <shesek_> Matiasu, try looking at the `target` property on the event object
[20:13:52] <shesek_> It might contain the element that was clicked, but I'm not sure what it contains on the blur event
[20:14:14] <shesek_> If it doesn't contain it - you can bind to the 'focus' event on the body instead, and check the target there
[20:14:21] <Matiasu> it contains the element that was focused
[20:14:40] <shesek_> Great. Just check its not the button or the submenu (or a child element of the submenu)
[20:16:00] <Matiasu> it's impossible, the event target is always the same: the element focused (it's the main button that you have to click to see the sumenu)
[20:16:37] <shesek_> oh, wait, the *old* focused element, prior to the blur event?
[20:16:42] <Matiasu> yep
[20:17:24] <shesek_> Matiasu, what about binding to the 'focus' event instead?
[20:17:37] <shesek_> on the body, that is
[20:17:53] <Matiasu> look at google.com, when you click the gear a submenu appears. then it seems on blur their hide it but at the same time if you click a subitem it works so I wonder the click over the subitem is triggered before the blur on the gear, that's the main difference
[20:18:20] <Matiasu> s/wonder/think/ I'm sorry
[20:19:08] <Matiasu> in jQuery the order is different, and the click event is triggered after the blur event :|
[20:19:13] <shesek_> Matiasu, the main difference is that they're probably not using blur event on the gear
[20:19:23] <Matiasu> maybe
[20:19:41] <Matiasu> oh, lets see if I can trigger it by hand :)
[20:19:41] <shesek_> checking for a focus on a non-great non-submenu element makes more sense to me
[20:19:50] <shesek_> * non-gear
[20:20:07] <Matiasu> yeah, I will do that, it's a good idea
[20:20:22] <Matiasu> but I will try to trigger it in their code just in case
[20:21:19] <Matiasu> $('body').trigger('focus') doesn't hide the submenu
[20:21:51] <shesek_> there are probably 10's of different ways to achieve that...
[20:22:00] <Matiasu> $('body').trigger('click') does
[20:22:39] <Matiasu> I know but it's interesting to see how they do things, you can always learn
[20:23:04] <shesek_> focus is better IMO. keyboard events should also hide the menu
[20:23:23] <shesek_> like tabbing into an element
[20:25:58] <Matiasu> shesek_, it's definitely not the blur event that hides the submenu
[20:26:06] <Matiasu> setTimeout(function() {$('#lst-ib').trigger('focus')}, 3000);
[20:26:19] <Matiasu> you end with the focus in the query input and the submenu opened!
[20:28:08] <Matiasu> anyway, $('body').click(hide submenu) should work. thank you!
[20:28:24] <shesek_> no problem
[20:29:37] <Matiasu> done, it works well! :)
[20:45:19] <Guddu> Could someone help me please? I have a question related to Checkbox
[20:53:25] <Guddu> I have a Datagrid which has a checkbox..When i select a row on the grid, the checkbox gets selected automatically....based on that...i would like to change the href of a link...How could we accomplish this? Please guide.
[21:03:05] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm trying to make a jQuery Mobile app that reads a JSON file and displays totals of categories/subcategories. How would I get the total of a top-level category? It seems like I need a recursive count function of sorts. This is the JSON data: http://codepad.org/tp4vjmCc
[21:13:21] <janthony> Is there a function that clears a field out on focus and restores it when leaving if nothing was typed? Or should I plan on building this from scratch? Figured it was popular functionality, but thought I would ask before building some kind of array and comparing against the static array.
[21:13:46] <themiddleman> janthony: thats called a placeholder
[21:14:36] <janthony> themiddleman: Ahh ok. I'll google that then
[21:14:42] <janthony> themiddleman: Thanks!
[21:14:46] <themiddleman> :D
[21:17:13] <janthony> Wow, that actually solves a lot of problems. Knew it was worth looking into. I was also going to have to build a php array to validate against to see if anything has been submitted and filter it out. Now I don't have to!
[21:17:43] <themiddleman> awesome!
[21:20:41] <janthony> Wow, works soooo nice. Feel like a noob now. Just have to figure out how to do it for textareas
[21:25:41] <theBrettman> anyone here good with php and jquery wanna help make a plugin for css faster?
[21:26:05] <theBrettman> there r some things I don't understand but I wanna take from cssTidy
[21:26:15] <theBrettman> it's basically like copying homework
[21:40:47] <Patabugen> Hey All. I've got a string containing some HTML which I want to modify (insert an elenent) and get back a a string, but I'm having some trouble. Can anyone help?
[21:40:48] <Patabugen> http://jsfiddle.net/xpGuJ/1/
[21:41:07] <rummik> Is it just me, or is jQuery UI's .sortable() very, very, glitchy?
[21:42:25] <Patabugen> I've tried wrapping the object, but still no joy ( anObject.wrap('<div />'); )
[21:42:48] <SigmaProjects> not sure if i should ask #eclipse, but.. Is there a dictionary or code-assist for Eclipse for jquery?
[21:46:27] <Patabugen> jQuery seems to be ignoring the body tag when giving me back my HTML
[21:48:31] <Patabugen> does jQuery treat tags called 'body' specially? Even if I double wrap it in two <span> tags the body tag is removed
[21:50:01] <theBrettman> the html method might ignore the body tag
[21:51:13] <Patabugen> There's no mention of it in the docs
[22:12:50] <someprimetime> wtf oksushi was in here haha
[23:43:57] <bjhaid> this line of code: $(imgas.splice(0|Math.random() * imgas.length, 1)[0]).delay(15).fadeIn(15).delay(200).fadeOut(50, i ? $.noop : nextImage) throws Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded please can anyone help with this
[23:59:17] <shesek_> bjhaid, does `imgas.splice(0|Math.random() * imgas.length, 1)[0]` return the intented result?
[23:59:36] <gyzmodo> wazzaaaaaaaaa
[23:59:53] <shesek_> bjhaid, what are you trying to do there, exactly?
