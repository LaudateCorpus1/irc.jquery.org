[06:57:53] * AdamPDotty cant picture it
[08:28:32] <Duikb00t-home> hello
[09:31:22] <sigdk> Hello. Can someone explain me what the classes tag does here: http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/classes-option/   ? Do I just override the default css?
[09:34:57] <Cork> sigdk: it is stated in the paragraph following it
[09:35:56] <sigdk> Cork, my understanding is that it overrides the current css
[09:36:18] <Cork> havn't ever used it, but it isn't what it is stating
[09:36:33] <Cork> and i don't see why it would
[09:37:32] <Cork> sigdk: this one is even more specific http://api.jqueryui.com/jquery.widget/#option-classes
[09:40:04] <MikeD_> part of the problem is that we've overloaded the class attribute to indicate both what something IS and how it should LOOK
[09:40:32] <Cork> not really
[09:40:49] <MikeD_> structural vs theme classes
[09:40:57] <Cork> you can just skip loading the theme from jquery-ui if you don't want there looks
[09:41:07] <Cork> the core.css is all you need
[09:44:51] <sigdk> I could change the color of the title in a dialog window like this: "ui-dialog-titlebar": "ui-dialog-titlebar-custom"   I can't do the same for the color of the modal behind the window: "ui-widget-overlay": "ui-widget-overlay-custom"  ( <--- doesn't work). Why?
[09:45:20] <Cork> no clue
[09:45:30] <Cork> i would just add rules for the normal css rules
[09:45:45] <Cork> give the dialog an id if you want the dialog specifically to have a different look
[09:45:58] <Cork> (the overlay will be harder, cause it is one overlay shared by all dialogs)
[09:46:10] <sigdk> Cork, that's what I would do to... but I'm not sure if that's the way to go
[09:46:26] <sigdk> why is that classes tag for?
[09:46:39] <Cork> donno, like i said, never used it
[10:39:53] <jquery008> hi. I got ... var1.volume = 1 and var2.volume = 1
[10:40:16] <jquery008> can I do something like:  var1.var2 = volume1 ?
[10:46:36] <sillyslux> mh... yes...
[10:48:54] <moeSizlak> i'm using native tooltips (title attribute).  on the same element im also using a jqueryui dialog box.
[10:49:34] <moeSizlak> hover mouse over it, title tooltip appears.  click it, dialog appears.  problem is...wehn you clsoe the dialog box the tooltip is still displaying
[10:49:45] <moeSizlak> and will continue to display until i click somewhere else on the page
[10:49:58] <moeSizlak> (in IE anyway.  works correctly in chrome)
[10:50:19] <moeSizlak> how can i manually trigger an the mouseout or un-hover event of the element?
[10:50:23] <sillyslux> sounds like a ie glitch to me, then
[10:50:30] <moeSizlak> or how can i manually hide the native tooltip?
[10:51:09] <moeSizlak> is there a way to fire the onmouseout event?
[10:51:13] <sillyslux> i don't think you can handle native tooltip appearance in js (and not in jquery)
[10:51:23] <sillyslux> but feel free to ask in ##javascript
[10:52:05] <moeSizlak> what about jquery trigger
[10:52:07] <sillyslux> $.trigger('mouseout') i think, but i doubt that will help
[10:54:08] <sillyslux> you can add listeners for  such events and have some code executed, but that doesn't have to mean anything to the browser
[10:54:24] <sillyslux> try updating ie
[10:55:26] <moeSizlak> it's ie11 which is the browser that is mainly used in my organization
[11:03:28] <verax5> someone please tell me how to loop through this..
[11:03:29] <verax5> {"username":["The username field is required."],"email":["The email field is required."],"password":
[11:03:29] <verax5> ["The password field is required."]}
[11:03:41] <verax5> its some awkward ass response..
[11:06:58] <sigdk> First I need to debug my jsfiddle: "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden)"   https://jsfiddle.net/soj4fejz/2/   Any clue?
[11:08:36] <BobFrankly> I want to do  if(stringVar regex matches){do stuff}  but can't find the syntax
[11:09:22] <shoky> if (regex.test(str)) { ... }
[11:09:50] <shoky> e.g.   if  (/foo/.test('you a fool')) { ... }
[11:10:24] <BobFrankly> awesome, thanks
[11:12:04] <BobFrankly> hmmm. I want to parameterize that regex, but doesn't seem to like that
[11:13:19] <verax5> omfg
[11:13:21] <verax5> someone help
[11:13:57] <shoky> regex can't be paramterized really.. you might want to build a regex from a string i guess, via `new RegExp(...)`
[11:14:44] <BobFrankly> ah yeah, there we go, thanks
[11:15:01] * BobFrankly just found the w3schools page for test() as you typed that :D
[11:15:05] <shoky> verax5: Object.keys(obj).forEach(key => { console.log(key, obj[key]) })
[11:15:28] <shoky> BobFrankly w3schools sucks, use mdn for javascript reference
[11:15:50] <BobFrankly> mozilla?
[11:15:59] <shoky> ya
[11:16:07] * BobFrankly adds that to his list
[12:06:25] <KnightsOfNi> Does anyone know how with isotope.js you can display the container and items perfectly laid out before the images are loaded? Somtimes there are 100+ items and atm I only show them when all images are loaded, which takes way too long... So looking for a solution to display the text immediately and show a loading icon for each image
[12:31:27] <mike_papa> What is correct way to prevent duplicate handlers in such case: http://jsbin.com/hajenizeho/edit?html,js,console,output ? .on() instead of .keydown(), or .off() .on() combination?
[12:31:51] <mike_papa> I meant .one(), or .off() .on().
[12:32:31] <kanzie> is there a good way to disable user input in a jqueryUI datepicker-field?
[12:32:42] <kanzie> setting attr to disable is overridden
[12:33:20] <robertmaxrees> mike_papa don't rebind listeners
[12:33:47] <robertmaxrees> why do you need two separate event handlers here?
[12:35:00] <shoky> kanzie: set readonly attribute
[12:35:16] <robertmaxrees> mike_papa nothing about that inner handler requires it to be in that first one.
[12:35:29] <kanzie> shoky: seems datepicker resets that attr
[12:35:53] <shoky> kanzie: seems fine https://jsfiddle.net/wxwq0ycu/
[12:36:09] <kanzie> hmm, Ill try again
[12:36:31] <mike_papa> robertmaxrees: thanks. Over complication by too much thinking. ;)
[12:36:39] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:38:09] <kanzie> shoky: the readonly attribute get reset somehow for me, I wonder if I have a different function doing it.
[12:38:55] <shoky> kanzie: probably. or you're re-creating the element or something
[12:39:03] <kanzie> yeah something is going on
[12:39:12] <kanzie> inspecting it reveals that the readonly attribute is removed
[12:42:50] <kanzie> shoky: I was editing files on the wrong server…
[12:42:52] <kanzie> sigh
[12:42:58] <kanzie> shoky: thanks for your help man
[12:43:15] <kanzie> I’l pouring myself a whiskey and accept that today is not a work day
[12:48:06] * taplar tries to think of the country song starting with 'pour me another shot of whiskey'
[13:06:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm amazed at how productive i've been working from home lately.
[13:06:37] <taplar> lol
[13:06:55] <taplar> finally back in your house?
[13:06:57] <robertmaxrees> also: i got a shiny new monitor to make working from the rental house easier.
[13:06:59] <robertmaxrees> oh god no.
[13:07:05] <robertmaxrees> i won't be back for at least 2 months now.
[13:07:16] <robertmaxrees> just got the bill for the asbestos abatement.
[13:08:41] <taplar> i was meaning to ask about that one day, as it seemed like you got off to 'go into work' around usually the time i'm used to you coming in here
[13:08:48] <taplar> you doing like half days?
[13:09:33] <robertmaxrees> nah, last week i was working from home to help my wife while she started recovery from her surgery and went in for meetings.
[13:10:04] <taplar> dang, hope she's all right
[13:10:13] <robertmaxrees> she tore her tendon a while ago.
[13:10:21] <robertmaxrees> she'll be off her feet for another 2 weeks.
[13:11:24] <taplar> i enjoy working from home.  i just don't like the throttle the vpn puts on me
[13:12:15] <taplar> and work is my main socialization point, so if i stay home too long i get restless
[13:13:23] <robertmaxrees> my work VPN is actually pretty reasonable.  only gimps me a little.
[13:13:30] <robertmaxrees> though i never really notice it.
[13:14:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah i still get like 30-40 mbps when vpn'd, which is plenty for what i need when working.
[13:14:45] * taplar mouth waters
[13:15:18] <robertmaxrees> my normal connection at home is usually 100+ with very little latency.
[13:15:38] <taplar> cabel?
[13:15:43] <taplar> cable even
[13:15:55] <robertmaxrees> heh yeah.  dsl is slowwww out here.
[13:16:12] <taplar> figured you guys would have google fiber as an option, ;)
[13:16:19] <robertmaxrees> hahaha nope.
[13:16:27] <robertmaxrees> and gf stopped expanson.
[13:16:28] <robertmaxrees> jerks.
[13:16:34] <taplar> huh
[13:17:38] <taplar> wiki says their shifting gf to a different (shell) company Alphabet Inc.
[13:17:59] <robertmaxrees> that's all of google.  check out the news - they announced they're stopping expansion.
[13:18:18] <robertmaxrees> http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/google-fiber-laying-off-9-of-staff-will-pause-plans-for-10-cities/
[13:18:37] <taplar> :s
[13:19:33] <taplar> i guess if they can drive down wireless isp prices it could be a good thing
[13:22:42] <robertmaxrees> if you check out the problems they've had with rollout it makes sense that they're pushing to get some profit before continuing.
[13:35:06] <morenoh149> is there a demo of a multiselect dropdown list?
[13:35:38] <morenoh149> my coworker achieved the effect with ui.selection.dropdown.multiple but I can't quite find it in the docs
[13:38:23] <robertmaxrees> morenoh149 which ui widget?
[13:38:42] <morenoh149> robertmaxrees: that's what I'm asking
[13:38:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:38:53] <morenoh149> it seems the docs never quite show this combination
[13:38:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:39:05] <robertmaxrees> so how is he instantiating the widget?
[13:39:11] <morenoh149> I see dropdown. and multiple selections
[13:39:15] <morenoh149> jquery UI
[13:39:47] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui has a ton of widgets - i'm tyring to figure out what method is getting called to create the basic widget you're working with :)
[13:39:55] <robertmaxrees> is it https://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/ ?
[13:40:41] <morenoh149> $(node).dropdown()
[13:41:03] <robertmaxrees> that's a custom plugin iirc.
[13:45:35] <morenoh149> lol nvm it's part of semantic ui
[13:53:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:00:58] <plamb_> do jquery Strings have a .contains method
[14:01:09] <taplar> no such thing as a jquery string
[14:01:15] <plamb_> javascript*******
[14:01:26] <taplar> ES6 might have one
[14:01:33] <taplar> you can do indexOf()
[14:01:37] <taplar> > -1
[14:06:30] <plamb_> why cant i use
[14:06:39] <plamb_> $(...).find(...).shift() ?
[14:06:50] <plamb_> gives me a typeerror
[14:06:53] <taplar> shift() is an array method, no?
[14:07:00] <plamb_> does .find not return an array if it finds multiple elems?
[14:07:04] <taplar> nope
[14:07:09] <plamb_> what type does it return
[14:07:09] <taplar> array 'like' object
[14:07:21] <plamb_> how would i drop the first element after a .find()
[14:07:22] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[14:07:28] <taplar> slice(1)
[14:07:45] <taplar> if you mean to just remove it from the result set
[14:07:51] <plamb_> yep
[14:07:53] <taplar> cause it doesn't affect the dom at all
[14:08:15] <plamb_> what about removing the last element from the result set
[14:08:49] <taplar> would probably want to two part that one, or maybe there is a pop() ?  *checks the docs*
[14:09:05] <taplar> nope
[14:09:20] <plamb_> i c
[14:09:26] <taplar> so yeah you'd probably want to two part it and $savedResults.slice(0, $savedResults.length - 2)
[14:09:44] <plamb_> cool
[14:15:03] <plamb_> is it possible to print an elems css values to the console
[14:16:47] <plamb_> hmm
[14:17:40] <plamb_> oh, you cant get a pseudo element huh
[15:08:06] <moeSizlak> I hvae this:  $.get( url, function(data){$( "#"+someVariableID ).attr('mytooltip', data ); });
[15:08:23] <moeSizlak> at what point is that someVariableID evaluated?
[15:08:33] <moeSizlak> calling the get, or during the callback?
[15:11:19] <sg> Hello! This is a strange use case: I want to hack jquery to know each time somebody uses to select an element. I'm wrapping methods jQuery.fn.find, etc but I would like to know if there is a general method I can wrap instead one by one? any ideas ? thanks in advanced!
[15:16:47] <plamb_> if i have a
[15:16:58] <sg> is it perhaps jQuery.find ?
[15:17:15] <sg> i'm in jQuery 1.*
[15:17:25] <plamb_> .productPress:after {content:'';width:5px;height:5px;background:white}
[15:17:39] <plamb_> and i do a $.addClass("productPress")
[15:17:52] <plamb_> will that pseudo element on the class show up
[15:17:58] <plamb_> or does content HAVE to have something in it
[15:19:17] <plamb_> like this
[15:19:18] <plamb_> http://jsfiddle.net/1dw7h4s3/74/
[15:21:28] <shoky_> plamb_: it just has to be visible if you want it to be visible :P  e.g. give it  display: inline-block
[15:22:12] <plamb_> its still not showing anything here
[15:22:18] <plamb_> http://jsfiddle.net/1dw7h4s3/76/
[15:22:21] <shoky_> plamb_: it's small and white,  are you sure? :)
[15:22:27] <plamb_> oh
[15:22:28] <plamb_> lokl
[15:22:40] <plamb_> u right
[15:23:58] <taplar> "shoky_: plamb_: it's small and white" ooooooh, what convo did i walk in on...

[16:06:30] <lulul> erm if my ajax response returns html code how can i show it on the page ?
[16:09:46] <taplar> you'd append it to some element on the page in one of the ajax callbacks
[16:11:33] <lulul> taplar i tried like this                 $('.info-container').html(data);
[16:11:34] <lulul> :D
[16:11:37] <lulul> seems it doesn't work
[16:11:48] <taplar> are you doing it in a callback for the ajax method?
[16:12:21] <lulul> yes
[16:12:44] <lulul> http://notey.it/n/d2d1
[16:12:52] <lulul> i can even see the data in console.
[16:13:35] <taplar> make sure the info-container exists
[16:14:35] <lulul> it exists =D
[16:14:52] <taplar> how did you verify that?
[16:15:25] <lulul> because i use the same template for the modal all over the project :D
[16:15:48] <lulul>             <div class="modal-body info-container">
[16:15:48] <lulul>             </div>
[16:15:52] <taplar> doesn't tell me how you verified that it exists at the point that you're trying to use it in the success callback
[16:17:04] <lulul> http://notey.it/n/d2d2
[16:17:11] <lulul> taplar console.log on selector in success
[16:17:31] <taplar> k
[16:17:53] <lulul> the response from php
[16:17:53] <lulul> http://notey.it/n/d2d3
[16:18:21] <taplar> it's an object?
[16:18:23] <lulul> the obj contains data: the html part, and success with value true
[16:18:27] <lulul> yes
[16:18:37] <taplar> so have you tried appending data.data ?
[16:18:48] <taplar> since that is the html
[16:19:22] <lulul> yeah u are right :D
[16:19:52] <lulul> thank you taplar =D
[16:19:57] <taplar> sure
[16:20:08] <lulul> was thinking that data is equal with data from obj =D
[16:20:12] <lulul> some magic stuff behind ;D
[16:20:38] <taplar> never trust magic, :)
[16:20:45] <taplar> to some extent

[16:27:52] <plamb_> if($(window).width() > 871)
[16:27:54] <plamb_> would say
[16:28:05] <plamb_> execute this if the windows width is greater than 871 pixels
[16:28:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:28:18] <plamb_> ugh
[16:28:21] <plamb_> well
[16:28:30] <plamb_> if im using the inspector to make the window smaller
[16:28:35] <plamb_> would it not see that?
[16:28:42] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to rerun the code.
[16:28:43] <taplar> why not resize the window?
[16:28:57] <plamb_> developer productivity
[16:29:07] <taplar> or do you mean your dragging the inspector up and down to change it?
[16:29:13] <plamb_> oh wait a second
[16:29:15] <plamb_> it IS working
[16:29:16] <plamb_> lol
[16:29:17] <plamb_> woops
[16:29:18] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:29:19] <taplar> :/
[16:35:33] <taplar> if you have that inside your conditional, consider storing $(window) in a var and reusing it
[16:49:44] <zigzagzig> hey

[16:55:02] <plamb_> best way to return the first element of a find() ?
[16:55:08] <taplar> eq(0)
[16:55:12] <zigzagzig> hmm
[16:55:12] <taplar> or first()
[16:55:28] <zigzagzig> it does here in chrome
[16:55:33] <plamb_> i c

[17:35:17] <BobFrankly> I listen to quite a broad swath of music with two expections, country and rap
[17:35:41] <taplar> so your saying you hate anything that taylor swift does
[17:35:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:35:55] <BobFrankly> she's more pop, but yeah
[17:36:21] <robertmaxrees> she's the embodiment of "crossover" these days.
[17:36:32] <BobFrankly> also, those crossover guys trying to mix country and rap....it's a simple string join to figure out the result = crap
[17:36:46] <taplar> mmm, absolutes are great

[17:43:42] <taplar> is that a thing?
[17:43:56] <BobFrankly> are you looking for a pan right now?
[17:44:04] <taplar> at work so... sure?
[17:44:18] <BobFrankly> well let me know how it goes, and I'll get back to you ;P
[17:44:52] <taplar> seriously though.  what kind of reeses we talking about for this?
[17:46:05] <BobFrankly> I was just making something up :D
[17:46:22] <BobFrankly> was thinking "how would one mix reeses and rice crispie treats"
[17:46:33] <BobFrankly> and I just realized, the marshmallows are missing
[17:47:52] <taplar> well i guess you could take like the reeses cereal and mix it with rice crispies
[17:48:07] <taplar> that'd be weird
[17:48:23] <taplar> and this is coming from the guy that as a kid would put cheese in with his cheerios
[17:48:25] <robertmaxrees> and foul
[17:48:28] <BobFrankly> weird? or delicious?
[17:48:40] <BobFrankly> wait, reees cereal?
[17:48:45] <taplar> sure
[17:48:48] * BobFrankly shudders
[17:49:05] <taplar> it's just like peanut butter cocco puffs, if i recall
[17:49:16] * BobFrankly hurls
[17:49:46] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese%27s_Puffs
[17:50:49] <taplar> didn't eat them much as a kid but they were alright.  was more of a honey combs kid
[17:51:37] <taplar> and seriously, cheesey cheerios!
[17:51:38] <robertmaxrees> remember smacks?
[17:51:41] <BobFrankly> capt crunch and life for this guy
[17:51:51] <BobFrankly> smacks was when I was a wee guy
[17:51:55] <taplar> oh yeah.  wasn't a big fan of them for some reason
[17:52:08] <robertmaxrees> i remember loving them even though they had the texture of sand.
[17:52:11] <taplar> had the frog character, right?
[17:52:18] <BobFrankly> yeah, the frog
[17:52:27] <BobFrankly> oh and tricks
[17:52:32] <BobFrankly> *trix
[17:52:55] <taplar> trix were good, and then they came out with the one version that just had the berries, like they finally admitted why kids ate it
[17:53:08] <BobFrankly> haha
[17:53:44] <BobFrankly> oh and pops
[17:54:06] <taplar> honey bunches of oats, when you want to convince yourself that your eating healthier
[17:54:22] <BobFrankly> Pops were all poofy, but they'd just flatten when you'd eat them
[17:54:39] <taplar> snap crackle pop?
[17:54:44] <BobFrankly> corn pops
[17:54:48] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ !!!!
[17:54:52] <robertmaxrees> i forgot all about those!
[17:54:56] <BobFrankly> Honey Bulls*** and Oats?
[17:54:56] <robertmaxrees> i loved those when i was a kid.
[17:55:24] <robertmaxrees> i'ma get me some corn pops asap.
[17:55:26] <taplar> hey, HBoO were good.  you just had to ignore the sugar content, with any cereal really
[17:55:28] <robertmaxrees> because holy shit
[17:55:46] <robertmaxrees> i worked at a company that digitized newspaper ads and put 'em online.
[17:55:54] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: they don't come with a dental plan, so buyer beware
[17:56:16] <robertmaxrees> we contracted with overseas companies for some of our data entry - they'd regularly label american breakfast cereals as candy.
[17:56:27] <taplar> lol
[17:56:54] <BobFrankly> considering many american breakfast cereals could be eaten dry....yeah, they're right...
[17:56:58] <taplar> it's not sugar water!  it's a snapple!
[17:57:22] <BobFrankly> It's arizona green tea! Its GOOD for you!
[17:57:57] <taplar> ugh
[17:58:06] <BobFrankly> "Dr Pepper has 41 flavors"    "Yes, and I think 5 of them are immodium AD!"
[17:58:18] <taplar> :O  fighting words
[18:01:03] <taplar> so back sorta to the original statement.  there's a browser on top of chromium that isn't chrome?
[18:01:52] <robertmaxrees> *blink
[18:02:07] <taplar> lol
[18:02:13] <taplar> i told you, candy man
[18:03:10] <taplar> seems like it exposes a bunch of customizable things
[18:03:53] <taplar> reminds me of one linux distro i once tried
[18:23:00] <webguynow> I'm curious, about using jQuery and it's selectors as a HTML editor, or to do Transformation, ie: ETL
[18:23:19] <webguynow> it could easily drop certain attributes, etc
[18:23:35] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:23:41] <webguynow> and let jQuery somehow pipe the output to a new file, or fragment
[18:23:56] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't choose jquery for that personally.
[18:24:39] <webguynow> of course this can be done easily, with XML language features, like XSLT  - but we're along way past xhtml
[18:24:51] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to build?
[18:24:52] <webguynow> any thoughts  about the easiest way to do this ?
[18:24:54] <robertmaxrees> WYSIWYG?
[18:25:20] <webguynow> I don't want to have to manually copy from the JS console, a fragment, if there's a better way
[18:25:34] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to select some html on a page and copy it?
[18:25:57] <robertmaxrees> jquery's great at selecting and manipulating pages.
[18:25:58] <taplar> you know you can copy from the inspector, right?
[18:26:03] <robertmaxrees> ^ also this :)
[18:26:09] <taplar> right click, copy, outer html
[18:26:16] <BobFrankly> taplar: http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/04/even-at-1-0-vivaldi-closes-in-on-the-cure-for-the-common-browser/
[18:26:34] <BobFrankly> also, rephrase, Vivaldi uses the same rendering engine as Chrome
[18:26:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, uses Blink.
[18:26:47] <robertmaxrees> as does opera.
[18:26:52] <taplar> sure, if it's built on chromium i'd assume that
[18:27:14] <robertmaxrees> also: i'm WAY thrilled with mozilla's plans to replace gecko.
[18:27:14] <BobFrankly> taplar: when I said "built on chromium", I mis-stated
[18:27:29] <BobFrankly> the re-phrase is more accurate
[18:27:39] <taplar> huh?
[18:27:53] <robertmaxrees> vivaldi isn't built on chromium taplar
[18:27:57] <BobFrankly> ^
[18:27:58] <taplar> ah
[18:28:01] <robertmaxrees> it's built using the chromne rendering engine.
[18:28:11] <taplar> the V8 thing?
[18:28:12] <webguynow> OK  Here's my 3 wishes ( for the Genie )
[18:28:16] <robertmaxrees> Blink
[18:28:23] <robertmaxrees> v8 is the js engine chrome uses.
[18:28:26] <webguynow> be able to pipe the output of jQuery selectors to a file
[18:28:47] <robertmaxrees> webguynow can't do that without a backend of some sort.
[18:28:55] <webguynow> be able to copy some element of a page to the Clipboard (?need greasemonkey ?)
[18:29:15] <taplar> you can copy to the clipboard if you do some activex stuff, iirc
[18:29:26] <robertmaxrees> flash
[18:29:37] <robertmaxrees> but something tells me he wants to automate something.
[18:29:38] <webguynow> on a page that I saved from the internet, be able to easily, disable Ajax
[18:29:55] <robertmaxrees> webguynow why do you want to do all of these things?
[18:29:59] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to scrape data?
[18:30:20] <webguynow> often yes, I have done that, and need to regularly
[18:30:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:30:35] <webguynow> whether it's from CL, or Yahoo Finance or something else
[18:30:48] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you're being obtuse about the question, but ok.  jquery wouldn't really be a good solution for that - at least, not on its own.
[18:30:50] <webguynow> Yahoo pipes ??  maybe
[18:31:03] <webguynow> Selenium solution ??
[18:31:13] <BobFrankly> yeah, look at selenium
[18:31:23] <BobFrankly> I've used that before, it's quite capable and fast
[18:31:23] <robertmaxrees> err, selenium is for testing.
[18:31:39] <robertmaxrees> in fact, depending on what you're doing, i'd steer you to use phantomjs or just python with something like beautifulsoup
[18:32:08] <robertmaxrees> but jquery + a browser won't really get you there.
[18:32:11] * BobFrankly uses selenium into phantomJS for scraping metrics from some of our appliances
[18:32:31] <BobFrankly> with powershell as the base language
[18:32:37] <robertmaxrees> iiinteresting.  i always thought it was mostly for testing.  it's just automation.
[18:32:40] <webguynow> for disabling, Ajax on a saved file - there might be 30 js files, that come down with it, but easiest might be just to rewrite (stub) the Ajax fx in  jQuery itself, or whatever low level fx works with xmlhttp object
[18:32:41] <robertmaxrees> ~*the more you know*~
[18:32:53] <BobFrankly> yeah, it's automation, thats the key
[18:32:55] <robertmaxrees> webguynow lol not "fx" - "fn"
[18:33:19] <robertmaxrees> webguynow and you could just do $.ajax = function() {};
[18:33:20] <webguynow> I'll take suggestions, but I'm a bit set in my ways *smile*
[18:33:23] <robertmaxrees> that'd get you pretty far.
[18:33:37] <robertmaxrees> but i'd really rethink your entire strategy for this.
[18:33:39] <taplar> $.ajax = function () { return $.Deferred(); };
[18:33:46] <robertmaxrees> ^ good point.
[18:33:53] <robertmaxrees> though that doesn't guarantee you've killed all ajax calls on the page.
[18:33:55] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: I only break that stuff out when REST or SNMP aren't options
[18:34:20] <robertmaxrees> s/REST/REST or other APIs
[18:34:29] <taplar> b-ot is dead
[18:34:33] <robertmaxrees> i know.
[18:34:39] <robertmaxrees> just making the point - not all APIs are REST.
[18:34:43] <taplar> lol
[18:34:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:34:49] <taplar> it's 'at' rest
[18:34:55] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[18:35:02] <BobFrankly> depending on the soap API, I'd typically ignore it as well
[18:35:14] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:35:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:35:43] <BobFrankly> ?
[18:35:44] <robertmaxrees> anybody using soap these days on the web at large is worth ignoring.
[18:35:48] <BobFrankly> ^
[18:35:51] <taplar> hated it
[18:35:55] <robertmaxrees> you can get your data elsewhere.
[18:36:07] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: hopefully :D
[18:36:12] <robertmaxrees> almost always.
[18:36:13] <BobFrankly> depends on your target :D
[18:36:34] <robertmaxrees> if you can't, get a library to abstract it away as much as possible,.
[18:36:39] <robertmaxrees> because yuck.
[18:37:08] <BobFrankly> giant web site? probably. Internal Medium sized data center? probably no elsewhere available outside of page scraping
[18:37:31] <robertmaxrees> reread what i said ;)
[18:37:42] <robertmaxrees> "[...] on the web at large [...]"
[18:37:54] <BobFrankly> yeah, was just revising :D
[18:38:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:38:09] <BobFrankly> that singular cup of coffee is missing it's friends
[21:19:35] <turtlepower> hi i have a div that is a list box and when i focus the listbox it populates the values, if i can store the original object based on document selector, is there any way in jquery to populate the data or do i need to regrab the element once it has changed its class
[21:19:49] <turtlepower> there is multiple of the same class of div
[21:19:57] <robertmaxrees> are you just adding contents to it?
[21:20:45] <turtlepower> no
[21:20:57] <turtlepower> im trying to extract the values of the listbox
[21:21:10] <turtlepower> so i can search by class and i get an array of 3 divs
[21:21:21] <robertmaxrees> so basically just so long as you don't remove/replace the original element, you're fine.
[21:21:22] <turtlepower> myElement[0] is what im interested in
[21:21:38] <robertmaxrees> you can add/remove classes, change data attributes, whatever.
[21:21:45] <turtlepower> yes but if i do .val(); it returns null
[21:21:52] <robertmaxrees> can you show me?
[21:21:52] <turtlepower> or map(); same thing
[21:21:56] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle?
[21:22:23] <turtlepower> yes hold on i can find u example
[21:22:28] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[21:22:49] <turtlepower> https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail&continue=https://mail.google.com/mail/?pc=topnav-about-en
[21:22:59] <Darren_> anyone know of any alternatives to jquery datatables?
[21:23:04] <Darren_> I hate working in tables
[21:23:11] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower huh?  where's YOUR code?
[21:23:48] <turtlepower> oh im trying to understand on this page in particular how this listbox works
[21:23:49] <turtlepower> so
[21:23:56] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ tables are great for tabular data, which is why datatables relies on them :)
[21:23:56] <turtlepower> cause its not like common list box
[21:23:59] <turtlepower> <div class="goog-inline-block goog-flat-menu-button-caption" id=":0" role="option" aria-setsize="12" aria-posinset="0">Month</div>
[21:24:01] <turtlepower> so
[21:24:09] <turtlepower> we can select this variable using selector
[21:25:00] <Darren_> robertmaxrees http://methodhome.com/beyond-the-bottle/soap-factory/ these giant like accordion sections, I need a search bar above that'll filter out questions as you type
[21:25:22] <turtlepower> myList=$('.goog-inline-block.goog-flat-menu-button-caption')
[21:25:33] <turtlepower> which would return an array of 3 objects
[21:26:21] <turtlepower> so if i wanted to take this array of objects and display the values or map assoiated with it it returns no result
[21:26:47] <turtlepower> so the only thing i can see if that when its brought into focus, the class changes
[21:26:53] <turtlepower> im kinda wondering how this works
[21:26:58] <turtlepower> whats it doing
[21:27:02] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower why are you basing this off of google's account creating form?
[21:27:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:27:14] <turtlepower> hrm i can find u another example
[21:27:19] <turtlepower> google uses it everywhere
[21:27:21] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower back waaaayyyy up.
[21:27:33] <robertmaxrees> i feel like this is an xy problem - what are youa ctually trying to do?
[21:28:06] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ you could build that relatively easily yourself.
[21:28:12] <robertmaxrees> no need for something like datatables.
[21:28:26] <turtlepower> so i want to find the position(s) of the strips that are populated after the div has been manipulated
[21:28:38] <turtlepower> like the rect of each strip
[21:28:38] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower_ but not on google's site, right?
[21:28:42] <robertmaxrees> just on your own site.
[21:28:52] <turtlepower> well any site
[21:28:59] <turtlepower> im just curious how it works
[21:29:08] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower the way google does it is different from the way other people do it.
[21:29:16] <robertmaxrees> that's why your question seems kind of strange.
[21:29:21] <turtlepower> oh this is unique to google only?
[21:29:39] <robertmaxrees> they have a particular way they're doing that form and those dropdowns, yes.
[21:29:44] <turtlepower> ah i c well thats what i figured thats why i called it advanced list box
[21:29:49] <turtlepower> because it makes no sense to me
[21:29:49] <robertmaxrees> probably because of the way they wanted to style it.
[21:29:55] <Darren_> robertmaxrees yeah, probably, if i knew how lol
[21:30:08] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower there are hidden inputs on the page that hold the selected values
[21:30:15] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ why do you want that kind of filter though?
[21:30:18] <turtlepower> oh
[21:30:25] <turtlepower> so the div never actually receives those values
[21:30:26] <turtlepower> ?
[21:30:26] <robertmaxrees> most folks wouldn't use something like that.
[21:30:29] <Darren_> client wants it
[21:30:32] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower divs never have values.
[21:30:36] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower inputs do.
[21:30:40] <turtlepower> im new to javascript so bear with me
[21:30:49] <turtlepower> =p
[21:30:49] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ *sigh* when will people stop doing stuff like this.
[21:31:01] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower the google form is a terrible place to start.
[21:31:21] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower are you trying to figure out a way to get all thje different name:value pairs in a form?
[21:31:34] <turtlepower_> yes
[21:31:40] <turtlepower_> but more so their position
[21:31:41] <turtlepower_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22294112/jquery-check-if-any-text-input-has-value
[21:31:46] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower "their position"?
[21:31:49] <turtlepower_> is this a good example as to what u mean by values
[21:31:51] <robertmaxrees> what does their position have to do with anything?
[21:32:05] <turtlepower_> yes im looking to get clientrect to see how they position on the page
[21:32:11] <turtlepower_> in relation to viewport
[21:32:11] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ a search box for this seems odd, but you could do this with a quick .filter()
[21:32:13] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower why?
[21:32:50] <Darren_> robertmaxrees I'll have to look that up, I know pretty much zero javascript, but I appreciate the direction you're sending me in
[21:33:01] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ learn.jquery.com is a great starter for the basics.
[21:33:03] <turtlepower_> robert just to understand about how javascdript sees the elements of a page and renders them
[21:33:14] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower javascript doesn't render anything.
[21:33:18] <robertmaxrees> that's now how pages work.
[21:33:31] <turtlepower_> again forgive me as i dont know all correct words stuff
[21:33:46] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower that's fine, just clarifying.
[21:33:48] <turtlepower_> i think i meant how javascript can locate
[21:33:53] <turtlepower_> using
[21:34:06] <turtlepower_> getBoundingClientRect();
[21:34:48] <robertmaxrees> still not really making sense - that just tells you what the browser has rendered.
[21:35:01] <turtlepower_> yes im looking for feedback from browser
[21:35:07] <turtlepower_> so like im interested in
[21:35:21] <turtlepower_> once that div has been clicked/foxus, so value list has popped up
[21:35:41] <turtlepower_> im interested in being able to 1) check the strip to see what value/name is assosiated with each strip
[21:35:56] <turtlepower_> 2) in turn find the rendered location on the viewport of where that strip is
[21:36:04] <turtlepower_> and im looking for best apprach to do this
[21:36:05] <robertmaxrees> why does that rendered location matter though?
[21:36:15] <turtlepower_> well it doesnt per say
[21:36:34] <turtlepower_> more so just isolating the element
[21:36:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:36:43] <turtlepower_> =]
[21:36:44] <robertmaxrees> you don't "isolate" that way.
[21:36:58] <turtlepower_> hrmm can u elaborate
[21:36:59] <turtlepower_> ?
[21:37:13] <turtlepower_> and thanks for taking time to help me with this problem
[21:37:23] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the bounding box of an element to know anything about it.
[21:37:27] <robertmaxrees> you have a DOM object.
[21:37:33] <robertmaxrees> you can interact with that and call it a day.
[21:37:42] <turtlepower_> ah i see
[21:37:53] <turtlepower_> so once i have the dom object
[21:37:58] <turtlepower_> how come i cant see values
[21:38:09] <robertmaxrees> because divs don't have values.
[21:38:11] <robertmaxrees> they have text.
[21:38:15] <robertmaxrees> you want the value of the hidden inputs.
[21:38:16] <turtlepower_> ah
[21:38:22] <turtlepower_> so .text(); might reveal more
[21:38:22] <turtlepower_> ?
[21:38:25] <robertmaxrees> but you wouldn't use google's way of doing this.
[21:38:34] <robertmaxrees> are you planning on building your own form?
[21:39:25] <turtlepower_> possibly but not currently
[21:39:53] <robertmaxrees> let me spin this: are you looking at googles form just to learn the basics about how to use js with forms?
[21:41:06] <turtlepower_> yes robert ur attitude is tops =] as for your spin, yes im trying to learn the basics but in relation to specifically this form and method as googles approach is unique id like to understand it and as to why they did it
[21:41:25] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you're wasting your time then.
[21:41:44] <turtlepower_> ah because method is shit
[21:41:45] <turtlepower_> ?
[21:41:45] <robertmaxrees> you're not going to get much out of looking at this if you don't really understand the basics.
[21:41:49] <robertmaxrees> no.
[21:42:02] <turtlepower_> ok robert
[21:42:02] <robertmaxrees> because they're solving for problems that you're going to have a hard time understanding out of the gate.
[21:42:09] <robertmaxrees> so start with the basics instead :)
[21:42:12] <turtlepower_> let me spin it to you
[21:43:33] <Darren_> robertmaxrees https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/ I basically have to make something like this
[21:43:51] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ oh...
[21:43:58] <robertmaxrees> that's much more complex than just filtering.
[21:43:59] <turtlepower_> if i wanted to, 1) find the element we are talking about, and modify it(sending a click/bringing it into focus) so it populates the list with the hidden values, and then once populated, being able to see propeties of the element then
[21:44:04] <turtlepower_> what way would i do it
[21:44:10] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower_ why?
[21:44:12] <Darren_> the best part, I have to do it in Squarespace
[21:44:20] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower_ are you trying to collect this data?
[21:44:36] <turtlepower_> robert yes trying to collect it
[21:44:42] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower why?
[21:44:50] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ yeesh
[21:44:55] <turtlepower_> now we are getting into deep questions
[21:44:59] <turtlepower_> why anything robert
[21:45:10] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower because that sounds an awful lot like mining data from their site.
[21:45:11] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[21:45:23] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ that's a... tall order.  i assume they'll want more than just the few questions they've got there now then?>
[21:45:36] <turtlepower_> i mean it sounds like hilary broke the law but im not the fbi know what i mean robert?
[21:45:48] <turtlepower_> =p
[21:45:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:45:55] <robertmaxrees> you don't really understand that issue.
[21:46:02] <robertmaxrees> and you are looking to break somebody's TOS
[21:46:10] <robertmaxrees> to collect, what, state lists?
[21:46:12] <robertmaxrees> ooor...?
[21:46:31] <turtlepower_> no i dont believe being able to manipulate data inside the browser is breach of ToS as far as i know
[21:46:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:46:52] <robertmaxrees> it sure looks like you'
[21:47:02] <robertmaxrees> *you're either mining data or automating some kind of account creation deal.
[21:47:09] <turtlepower_> doing something with that data to breach ToS would be
[21:47:10] <turtlepower_> in theory
[21:47:13] <robertmaxrees> both of which are going to be big no-nos.
[21:47:32] <turtlepower_> i agree
[21:47:34] <turtlepower_> big no nos
[21:47:41] <turtlepower_> but im not asking for anything such as that
[21:47:53] <robertmaxrees> then why are you being evasive about what you're trying to do?
[21:48:22] <robertmaxrees> 'cause getting key/value pairs out of a form is pretty easy.
[21:48:30] <turtlepower_> i was clear what i wanted to do, get the rect and values of a div
[21:48:43] <turtlepower_> once it mutates and populates with ḧidden"data as u say
[21:48:50] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i said.
[21:48:54] <robertmaxrees> i said the inputs are hidden.
[21:48:58] <turtlepower_> oh i c
[21:49:05] <robertmaxrees> why do you care about that data though?
[21:49:23] <turtlepower_> well i mean its my browser
[21:49:24] <robertmaxrees> like, what're you building?  maybe there's an easier way to get the data you want.
[21:49:27] <turtlepower_> i think we should all care
[21:49:32] <turtlepower_> =]
[21:49:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:49:41] <robertmaxrees> whatever mang.
[21:49:43] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[21:49:46] <turtlepower_> okay once second
[21:49:49] <turtlepower_> one second
[21:50:58] <robertmaxrees> dude don't pm me lol
[21:51:03] <robertmaxrees> keep it in chat.
[21:51:54] <turtlepower_> no problem
[21:52:35] <turtlepower_> so if position is critical to my project
[21:52:46] <robertmaxrees> what's the project?
[21:52:52] <turtlepower_> would there be a way to do it within the context i have described
[21:53:15] <turtlepower_> turtlepower_get_pos_of_div_element
[21:53:16] <robertmaxrees> you haven't even described what end goal you really have, sooo....
[21:53:34] <turtlepower_> my end goal is to get the position of a div element strip containing the value i am interested in
[21:53:44] <turtlepower_> in relation to the viewport
[21:53:44] <robertmaxrees> what's the project as a whole?
[21:53:55] <turtlepower_> that is the whole project
[21:53:59] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[21:54:01] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.
[21:54:02] <Darren_> robertmaxrees there's a bout a couple dozen questions
[21:54:28] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ will they all have images and stuff on them or what?  because depending on the amount of data this gets to be a little more involved.
[21:54:29] <Darren_> robertmaxrees I just need to find a lib I can use, since anthing from scratch would be out of my depth
[21:55:01] <Darren_> robertmaxrees tbh I'm not sure, I think its just straight text, I'm finding out more details tmrw, but based on the info I got, I think just text
[21:55:22] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ depending on how much stuff you might need more than just "a library" - that's why I ask.
[21:55:51] <Darren_> robertmaxrees lib would be fine for just text?
[21:55:59] <robertmaxrees> depends on how much.
[21:57:00] <robertmaxrees> let me see how WA does it
[21:57:52] <turtlepower_> ah so....its impossible or?
[21:57:57] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower that's not what i'm saying.
[21:58:14] <robertmaxrees> you're being obtuse and evasive about what i'm asking.
[21:58:35] <turtlepower_> i can clarify for sure if that would mean ur assistance
[21:58:43] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower what are you trying to build?
[21:58:45] <turtlepower_> im stumped on this problem currently...
[21:58:59] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ do you just need that dropdown and autocomplete thing?
[21:59:28] <robertmaxrees> or did you want the result previes and stuff mixed in, too.
[21:59:29] <Darren_> not the dropdown part, it just needs to filter out
[21:59:38] <Darren_> http://elasticlunr.com/example/index.html?
[21:59:41] <Darren_> basically this
[21:59:48] <Darren_> but have it look like that whatsapp link i sent
[22:00:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's going to be relatively involved if they want more than a few questions in there.
[22:00:59] <robertmaxrees> that being said, elasticlunr.com/example/index.html? should work pretty well.
[22:01:04] <robertmaxrees> could give it a shot.
[22:01:18] <Darren_> i downloaded it
[22:01:25] <Darren_> and ran the index file in the examples folder
[22:01:29] <Darren_> and it does nothing
[22:01:32] <Darren_> idk if it can be run locally
[22:01:38] <Darren_> or im just doing something wrong
[22:01:39] <turtlepower_> im trying to make a framework for calculating the relative position of any element on any page
[22:01:45] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower why?
[22:01:53] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower why is that information helpful to you?
[22:02:02] <robertmaxrees> because getting element offsets is easily done by jquery.
[22:02:13] <robertmaxrees> Darren_ might need to actually use a full dev server,
[22:02:22] <turtlepower_> yes normally it is easy but in this particular case it is more difficult then i thought
[22:02:42] <robertmaxrees> turtlepower very easy.  so why do you need the element offsets of google dropdown forms so bad?
[22:02:47] <turtlepower_> these values will allow me to see how different pages are rendered on different browsers
[22:03:45] <robertmaxrees> " i was just trying to ask if we could discuss in PM a way to frame the question
[22:03:45] <robertmaxrees> for public chat that would feel more comfortable with...
[22:03:48] <turtlepower_> hrmm...i see your concerns because of the content of my particular example
[22:03:55] <robertmaxrees> why would that make "the public" uncomfortable?
[22:04:09] <turtlepower_> u mentioned that in this case it could be a violation of ToS
[22:04:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:04:22] <turtlepower_> i didnt want to create a conflict such as that to get the help i needed
[22:04:33] <robertmaxrees> it sounded a helluva lot like you were trying to mine data.
[22:04:48] <robertmaxrees> but if you want to compare how a site renders in different browsers, that exists already.
[22:05:00] <robertmaxrees> http://browsershots.org/ and https://www.browserstack.com/screenshots are both pretty popular options.
[22:05:15] <turtlepower_> is it open source
[22:05:33] <robertmaxrees> you could use selenium, too.
[22:05:37] <turtlepower_> see
[22:05:40] <turtlepower_> there is the problem
[22:05:51] <turtlepower_> selenium is often assoiated with data mining
[22:05:52] <turtlepower_> as u say
[22:06:00] <robertmaxrees> we use it for testing at my work.
[22:06:15] <turtlepower_> yes agreed
[22:06:18] <robertmaxrees> ...
[22:06:49] <robertmaxrees> either way, if what you're trying to do is cross-browser testing, there's your solution.
[22:06:55] <turtlepower_> ah thank you
[22:07:06] <turtlepower_> youve been most helpful
[22:08:06] <turtlepower_> where do you work? are u a javascript programmer by trade?
[22:08:20] <robertmaxrees> yes.  and it's easy enough to find out where i work ;)
[22:09:19] <turtlepower_> oh shit cool site =]
[22:10:45] <turtlepower> can u hook up discounts
[22:10:46] <turtlepower> ?
[22:11:28] <arc_> lol -_-
[22:11:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:11:50] <robertmaxrees> not to random people on internet.
[22:11:59] <robertmaxrees> i get deep discounts for working there though.
[22:12:05] <turtlepower> nice!

[22:20:25] <turtlepower> data mining and home improvements are my passions for 2016 ha ha ha ...
[22:20:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[22:20:48] <turtlepower> jk about data mining
[22:20:57] <turtlepower> u need to laugh more robert
[22:21:04] <robertmaxrees> this guy...
[22:21:05] <turtlepower> it will help with marital problem stuff ur having
[22:21:06] <robertmaxrees> moving on.
[22:21:12] <robertmaxrees> not funny duder.
[22:21:36] <turtlepower> yeah shouldnt joke about data mining
[22:21:39] <turtlepower> violates ToS
[22:21:47] <turtlepower> big no no
[22:21:52] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[22:21:58] <turtlepower> =]
[22:22:09] <turtlepower> i miss irc
[22:22:36] <turtlepower> i havent been on irc for so freaking long
[22:23:04] <turtlepower> robert is there any way you can help me with my issue or is it out the the question
[22:23:04] <turtlepower> ?
[22:23:19] <robert_away> i already told you.
[22:23:26] <robert_away> use selenium to compare how browsers render sites.
[22:23:30] <robert_away> boom. done.
[22:23:31] <turtlepower> i feel like we lost scope
[22:23:35] <robert_away> uh
[22:23:58] <turtlepower> selenium isnt an option because of abuse
[22:24:09] <robert_away> you said you wanted to compare visual placement of elements on a page.
[22:24:15] <robert_away> that's a great way to do it.
[22:24:21] <turtlepower> like i said i feel like we lost scope
[22:24:27] <robert_away> how?
[22:25:30] <turtlepower> my project is say a mouse assistant...so basically i can use voice commands to control my mouse on my tv
[22:25:47] <robert_away> uh-huh
[22:26:01] <turtlepower> so i want to make it so i can click on birthmonth, i say click birthmonth and select januarary
[22:26:10] <turtlepower> so it does that
[22:26:15] <turtlepower> but it order for it to do that
[22:26:28] <robert_away> you wouldn't need to simulate a mosue for that.
[22:26:38] <turtlepower> i need it to KNOW where birthmonth is, and then KNOW which option is januarary
[22:26:43] <turtlepower> god damn ur slick robert
[22:26:50] <robert_away> and that would require much more work than you think.
[22:26:55] <robert_away> for cases like google at least.
[22:27:05] <turtlepower> yes yes!
[22:27:08] <robert_away> anyway, i actually have to go away for a bit.
[22:27:11] <robert_away> bye
[22:27:17] <turtlepower> ahhh
[22:27:22] <turtlepower> miss u robert come back!
[22:52:56] <coldhead> bye snover
[23:15:00] <Alturic> Hey guys, does anyone know any good freelance sites? Freelancer is a little difficult due to the language barrier and you can't just message freelancers to ask questions/see if they are interested, etc.
[23:21:05] <holycrunchitz> hey
