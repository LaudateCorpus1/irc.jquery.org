[00:00:45] <CssNoob> From my contact me page, How can I fix my message label like this:
[00:00:45] <CssNoob> http://raineer24.github.io/work/#
[00:00:46] <CssNoob> http://i.imgur.com/sImZQBO.png?1
[00:06:37] <Cork> CssNoob: wrong channel should have been asked in #css
[00:06:45] <Cork> but simplest is to not use float
[00:06:56] <Cork> use display: inline or display: inline-block instead
[00:07:39] <Cork> (you need to set it on both of the first fields though)
[00:08:14] <CssNoob> Cork thanks
[00:08:21] <Cork> something like #contact ul li.msgname, #contact ul li.msgname + li { display: inline-block; } should work
[00:21:59] <_eddy> Good morning everyone. I am using $.get to get a json that looks like this http://kopy.io/cTpEF please note the expires_in and then storing it using localStorage like http://kopy.io/NJjET now I only want to run this get requests ONLY if the stored token has expiry has expired is they a way yo use jquery to do this?
[00:24:22] <_eddy> the expiry_in is in seconds
[00:24:56] <tty> i am including a js with $.get("http://192.168.3.6/include/topnav.html", function(data) { $("#topnav").html(data); }); to load html. but the div is flashing for a millisecond before loading in contrast to having the html put directly inside the html. is it possible to fix this?
[00:31:43] <Cork> tty: the ms is cause you prob run on the same machine
[00:32:03] <Cork> tty: in real life you should expect much longer times
[00:32:16] <Cork> and no there isn't a way to get around the loading time when you make a separate http call
[00:32:21] <prohobo> atleast its not in imperial units
[00:32:36] <prohobo> nunes:moments:instants:winks
[00:32:59] <prohobo> and dwinks
[00:33:28] <tty> Cork: i see. is there any best practice on loading external html?
[00:33:38] <_eddy> Cork: any ideas for my case please
[00:34:01] <Cork> tty: if you want to load it client side, show a throbber/placeholder or similar
[00:34:06] <Cork> btw http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/02/19/lenovo-caught-installing-adware-new-computers/
[00:34:08] <Cork> lovely
[00:35:01] <Cork> _eddy: if cases is you're friend :)
[00:35:22] <Cork> you would have to check the values you have in localStorage and go from there
[00:35:31] <Uhkis> *are your friends ;)
[00:36:04] <Cork> -_-'
[00:36:12] <Uhkis> way to go lenovo
[00:36:17] <Cork> man i HATE that part of english
[00:36:34] <prohobo> Cork: you're not a native english speaker?
[00:36:34] <Cork> Uhkis: in the long run it means any site can mitm any page >_>
[00:36:51] <Cork> as long as you can extract the private key for the cert from swordfish
[00:36:58] <Cork> prohobo: no, i'
[00:36:59] <Uhkis> Cork: yup
[00:37:00] <_eddy> Cork: yes I know but i need to confirm the time stamp somewhere
[00:37:02] <Cork> *'m not
[00:37:11] <SirLagz> Cork: wow. That's a new low for an OEM
[00:37:14] <Cork> _eddy: confirm?
[00:37:22] <Cork> SirLagz: sure is...
[00:37:32] <Uhkis> go back to ibm thinkpads
[00:37:59] <_eddy> Cork: yes thats how if works init
[00:38:15] <Cork> the loveliest part is that lenovo sees nothing wrong with installing the mitm...
[00:38:40] <Cork> _eddy: i meant i don't understand what you meant by confirm in this context
[00:38:59] <Cork> you mean you need to verify that the expired date is up to date?
[00:39:21] <_eddy> Cork: if i store the value of the expires time in the localStoage
[00:39:47] <Cork> ya?
[00:39:59] <_eddy> how will i then check this? remember i only want to run the get IF the expires_in time has ran out
[00:40:24] <Cork> you almost wrote the code in that question
[00:40:37] <Cork> if(date-is-older-then-now) { $.get() }
[00:41:03] <_eddy> Cork: how will i track down the old one?
[00:41:09] <Cork> uh...
[00:41:19] <Cork> you store it in localStorage...
[00:41:32] <prohobo> cacheee
[00:42:30] <_eddy> Cork: How will i check that 86400 seconds is still 86400 seconds tomorrow? after i have shut down a system
[00:42:56] <Cork> the server should send an end date instead of a life time
[00:43:16] <Cork> and make sure to send it in iso 8601
[00:43:44] <Cork> meaning YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ
[00:43:52] <_eddy> Cork: I can't do that because its a plugin and i cant change it
[00:44:08] <Cork> does it send a "start time"?
[00:44:44] <_eddy> Cork: this is what it sends http://kopy.io/cTpEF
[00:45:01] <_eddy> its and OAUTH2 dont know if you have use it
[00:45:07] <Cork> then you're SOL...
[00:45:52] <Cork> the best you could do is check for the date header
[00:46:00] <_eddy> Cork: I have an idea dont know if jquery support it. But does jquery have a timestramp?
[00:46:02] <Cork> of xhr exposes that
[00:46:14] <Cork> _eddy: this doesn't depend on jquery
[00:47:23] <_eddy> Cork: it kinda does because although the user might check the timestramp the plugin does valid it
[00:47:39] <_eddy> unfortunately it doesnt return it with the json
[00:47:53] <Cork> _eddy: i meant you need to get from when this time is
[00:47:59] <Cork> and client site can't really answer that
[00:48:24] <_eddy> hmmm
[00:49:22] <Cork> _eddy: http://jsfiddle.net/vjysn2je/
[00:49:27] <Cork> try doing something like that
[00:50:14] <Cork> and hope the server returns gmt/utc
[00:52:10] <xaxaxaxa> I have question about jstree. Guys do you know what is under node param in first ajax call (when i want to get root nodes from server)?
[00:56:48] <_eddy> Cork: Thu, 19 Feb 2015 08:56:25 GMT
[00:57:03] <_eddy> thats what it returns
[00:58:25] <Cork> so var start = new Date('Thu, 19 Feb 2015 08:56:25 GMT'); start.setMinutes(start.getMinutes() + 86400); if(start < (new Date())) {}
[00:58:39] <sacho> ^ no guarantee new Date() will work with that format.
[00:59:14] <Cork> hmm, ya just checked
[00:59:19] <Cork> and chrome messes it up
[00:59:26] <Cork> (doesn't parse the timezone)
[01:00:33] <_eddy> Cork: I need to store that time in localStorage and then check it with the"expires_in":2630000
[01:00:37] <_eddy> which is in seconds
[01:01:11] <Cork> _eddy: well you're biggest problem is parsing the timestamp
[01:02:28] <Cork> i would prob look at moment.js
[01:02:59] <Cork> as Date sucks at parsing anything other then american date formats
[01:05:03] <sacho> Date only guarantees to parse formats it generates with its to*String functions and the iso format
[01:05:09] <xaxaxaxa> so anyone know what will be under node in first ajax call? http://jsfiddle.net/ukhq8bx0/
[01:06:26] <xaxaxaxa> or more precise http://jsfiddle.net/ukhq8bx0/1/
[01:07:29] <Cork> sacho: and a bunch of american dates
[01:07:58] <sacho> no, there's no guarantee for anything else
[01:08:11] <Katharsis> http://wklej.to/6eqDt/text why this code block click event for my inputs?
[01:08:27] <Cork> xaxaxaxa: tried console.log(node) ?
[01:09:05] <_eddy> hi Cork sorry about that. I can use php to parse the date
[01:09:17] <_eddy> so what am i parsing it to?
[01:09:44] <Cork> _eddy: if you can do something with the date before you send it to the client
[01:09:52] <Cork> just set a end date instead
[01:10:04] <xaxaxaxa> Cork: no, ty.
[01:10:45] <_eddy> Cork: i cant set an end date but i might be able to do something like return 30 days from today
[01:11:15] <Cork> _eddy: that isn't the slightest better then the duration in seconds
[01:11:20] <Cork> if anything it is worse
[01:11:57] <Cork> _eddy: to correctly calculate an end time from a duration you MUST have from when this duration starts
[01:12:11] <Cork> its not possible to do without
[01:13:02] <Cork> else you end up with how long is a piece of string
[01:13:19] <_eddy> Cork: the time starts from when the script is runs
[01:13:26] <Cork> ya, server side
[01:13:31] <_eddy> yes
[01:13:43] <Cork> so the server needs to tell the client what this time is
[01:15:00] <Cork> _eddy: if you don't care about precision you could just store the time of when you got the response
[01:15:52] <Cork> but be aware that this could be offskew by several minutes in some cases
[01:19:13] <_eddy> Cork: nah dont want that. This script is might to one has soon has the user launch this IOS app
[01:19:28] <anli> What is preferred, <input type="submit">, <input type="button"> or <button></button>?
[01:20:39] <Cork> anli: for me; the last one, every time
[01:20:47] <anli> Yeah
[01:20:58] <Cork> input submit/button has horrible cross browser compatibility
[01:21:13] <Cork> to the level where i have git hooks banning the use >_>
[01:21:58] <Cork> its basically impossible to get input type submit to style the same in all browsers
[01:22:04] <_eddy> Cork: :D it does store the expire time :D
[01:22:35] <_eddy> i will just need to get it from the database and sent it with the response
[01:22:40] <_eddy> it stores it has 1426967344
[01:23:02] <Cork> _eddy: nice
[01:23:18] <_eddy> damn i just when break dead
[01:23:22] <_eddy> brain
[01:23:38] <Cork> the last part to be aware of is that clients can have clocks that is way wrong
[01:23:47] <Cork> like in days wrong
[01:24:00] <_eddy> Cork: that is true...
[01:24:32] <Cork> (browser need to deal with this for ssl connection surprisingly often)
[01:24:54] <tty> how can i disable cache with this ? $.get("http://192.168.3.6/include/topnav.html").success(function(data){$("#topnav").html(data)});
[01:25:07] <Cork> tty: use $.ajax
[01:25:14] <Cork> and set cache: false in the options
[01:25:16] <_eddy> Cork: Thats what I need to do. I will have a pop up broswer on the user phone witht he login
[01:25:25] <Cork> tty: also its .done, not .success
[01:25:27] <_eddy> no i cant
[01:35:37] <tty> Cork: i tried http://pastebin.com/qzGiRXnQ. it loaded the html but i had some css linked inside it that did not load
[01:36:03] <Cork> tty: is topnav.html a full html page?
[01:36:15] <Cork> meaning with <html><head> and so on?
[01:36:34] <tty> no. just some divs. should i use <html> and <head> for the imports?
[01:36:47] <Cork> no
[01:36:48] <tty> but that would put <html> tag twice right?
[01:36:51] <Cork> where is the style then?
[01:37:04] <Katharsis> hi
[01:37:05] <tty> in the topnav.html
[01:37:09] <Cork> ...
[01:37:11] <Cork> WHERE
[01:37:15] <Omar-> good morning
[01:37:16] <tty> on the top
[01:37:24] <Cork> heh...
[01:37:26] <Katharsis> http://wklej.to/rJHGb/text why my leaflet popup isn't in center position?
[01:37:42] <Cork> tty: could you please give a meaning full answer?
[01:38:21] <esko> offtopic, could someone help with select2?
[01:38:22] <Cork> i don't care what position in the html is has, but in what context
[01:38:45] <Cork> Katharsis: not a jquery question
[01:38:51] <tty> Cork: http://pastebin.com/hbqxvEv9
[01:39:04] <Cork> ouch
[01:39:07] <tty> :)
[01:39:14] <Cork> tty: ok ya, you shouldn't do that
[01:39:19] <tty> i thought so
[01:39:25] <Cork> neither of the top three lines
[01:39:36] <Cork> the js should work, but i wouldn't recommend it
[01:39:42] <Cork> the css... not so much
[01:39:56] <tty> i wanted to include a js and a div on the main html and load a styles div etc
[01:40:02] <tty> any advice?
[01:40:07] <Cork> tty: when you load content through ajax you merge it into the current page
[01:40:14] <Cork> it doesn't work like iframes
[01:40:28] <Cork> so the script will run in the same scope the current page runs
[01:40:32] <Cork> and same for styles
[01:41:23] <tty> Cork: and this is the main html http://pastebin.com/smYTBkH4
[01:42:20] <Cork> tty: doctype!
[01:42:30] <Cork> don't write quirk mode
[01:42:41] <Cork> <!doctype html> at line 1
[01:42:53] <tty> done :)
[01:43:21] <Cork> and you're already including the topnav.js
[01:43:30] <Cork> no need to include it again in the partial
[01:43:47] <Cork> and i would recommend to just add the css links in the main page
[01:44:20] <tty> topnav.js != navbar.js
[01:44:54] <tty> hm ok. i thought i could avoid this with just using a script tag.
[01:45:16] <tty> i wanted to have a script tag and a div required to inject a navigation bar across web apps.
[01:45:19] <Cork> tty: also ready doesn't work for ajax calls
[01:45:32] <Cork> so the script tag in the partial will run before the html in the partial is loaded
[01:45:52] <tty> do you think there is a better way to approach this?
[01:45:54] <Cork> i would recommend to just include the needed js and have a function you call from .done
[01:45:56] <hendry> hi there, I'm trying to rotate some text. But this isn't working: $('#rotateme').text('Some other text!').fadeIn(500).delay().text('Some other thing').fadeIn(500); // ... am I missing something? Only 'Some other thing' shows
[01:46:02] <Cork> tty: kinda, ya :)
[01:46:24] <Cork> hendry: $('#rotateme').text('Some other text!').fadeIn(500).delay().text('Some other thing').fadeIn(500);
[01:46:24] <tty> Cork: any hints?
[01:46:40] <Cork> hendry: is the same as $('#rotateme').text('Some other text!').text('Some other thing').fadeIn(500).delay().fadeIn(500);
[01:46:54] <Cork> delay is for animations not dom modifications
[01:47:24] <Cork> hendry: so $('#rotateme').text('Some other text!').fadeIn(500, function() { $(this).text('Some other thing').fadeIn(500); });
[01:48:00] <Cork> hmm though you have to fadeOut/hide before you can fadeIn again
[01:48:14] <Cork> hendry: so $('#rotateme').text('Some other text!').fadeIn(500, function() { $(this).hide().text('Some other thing').fadeIn(500); });
[01:50:25] <tty> Cork: initial thought was to make the navigation bar an angularjs app and include the ng-app
[01:50:33] <hendry> Cork: still doesn't appear to work
[01:51:52] <Katharsis> may I use `contains` for checking the last sign? i need sth like 'label:last_sign(:)"
[01:52:13] <hendry> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/e0jmcx3u/
[01:52:47] <Cork> hendry: http://jsfiddle.net/e0jmcx3u/1/
[01:52:51] <xaxaxaxa> Katharsis: just split and check last item i array
[01:52:55] <Cork> again for fadeIn to work, the element has to be hidden
[01:53:18] <Cork> and you prob want a fadeOut too
[01:53:34] <Katharsis> xaxaxaxa: its not pretty solution ;]
[01:54:09] <Cork> hendry: something like http://jsfiddle.net/e0jmcx3u/2/
[01:54:53] <Cork> hendry: that said, i would recommend moving the text inside html
[01:54:56] <Cork> where it should be
[01:56:13] <xaxaxaxa> Katharsis: you could always check all labels and use each to select those you want
[01:56:42] <xaxaxaxa> select
[01:57:13] <hendry> Cork: true, I did find this... but I don't understand the code. I don't understand how to change it to output the text on
[01:57:25] <hendry> Cork: ... #rotateme http://jsfiddle.net/S5Cjm/1704/
[01:58:26] <xaxaxaxa> Katharsis: or use regex, label:regex()
[01:58:45] <Katharsis> why not
[01:59:35] <Cork> hendry: http://jsfiddle.net/S5Cjm/1705/
[01:59:46] <Cork> a fairly good example
[02:00:08] <Cork> hendry: it finds the first li in the ul
[02:00:13] <Cork> gives it to InOut
[02:00:36] <Cork> InOut animates that element, and then recurses to the next sibling
[02:00:57] <Cork> (and my modification) then continues to the first element again when hitting the end
[02:00:57] <xaxaxaxa> Katharsis: i think regex would be like : "*:$"
[02:01:32] <Cork> hendry: all you need to do to add/modify the values is the lis in the html
[02:01:42] <Cork> js isn't dependent on those
[02:01:56] <Cork> hendry: if you need it for <h1> use span instead of li
[02:02:02] <Cork> and it should work just fine
[02:05:19] <djam90> Hi... Can someone help me? I have some jQuery code:  timeSlotDiv.after('<div class="clear"></div>').after(timeSlotSpan);    (timeSlotDiv is $('<div class="tickBox">'); )    and it works flawlessly in Chrome, but it doesn't work in IE8? (jQuery v 1.11.1)
[02:05:41] <Cork> ugg old ie...
[02:05:51] <djam90> i know, i wish we didn't have to support it but...
[02:05:55] <djam90> there are no errors in IE
[02:06:04] <dsfsdf> no psuedo selectors in IE isnt it?
[02:06:04] <djam90> no JS errors, I have ES5 shim and HTML5 shim
[02:06:31] <djam90> My timeSlotSpan element is: $('<span class="timeslot-text">').text(item.description);
[02:06:47] <Cork> djam90: i would start by going native and see if that works
[02:06:58] <Cork> ?mdn insertAfter
[02:06:59] <b-ot> Cork: Node.insertBefore() - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.insertBefore
[02:07:03] <Cork> hmm
[02:07:36] <Cork> ah, right there isn't an after
[02:08:29] <Cork> ya, anyway i stay away from ie8 if i don't have to
[02:08:37] <Cork> i'm not a narcissist
[02:09:12] <djam90> http://jsfiddle.net/kktkjshm/  doesn't even seem to work, think I am going crazy now
[02:09:15] <Cork> anyway after is: parentDiv.insertBefore(newElement, target.nextSibling);
[02:10:00] <djam90> So is this a jQuery bug?
[02:10:06] <djam90> Because I thought it fully supported IE8
[02:10:09] <djam90> including it's methods
[02:10:10] <Cork> might be
[02:10:12] <Cork> not sure
[02:10:18] <Cork> i REALLY don't care about ie8 anymore
[02:10:49] <Xatenev> actually we >all< shouldnt care about ie8 anymore.. :p
[02:10:59] <Xatenev> the onyl right choice^^
[02:11:13] <hendry> Cork: I want to keep the strings in a list and just populate an arbitary #id with the string
[02:11:26] <Cork> djam90: this is what jquery does this.parentNode.insertBefore( elem, this.nextSibling );
[02:11:32] <Cork> (copied from the source)
[02:11:43] <Uhkis> Xatenev: shouldn't being the keyword ;)
[02:11:47] <Cork> as you're working with a fragment, that mgith break in ie
[02:11:59] <Uhkis> but those damn clients!
[02:12:00] <Xatenev> Uhkis: :p
[02:12:04] <Xatenev> Uhkis: iKR
[02:12:20] <djam90> Cork what do you mean working with a fragment ?
[02:12:38] <Cork> djam90: unattached dom elements == a document fragment
[02:12:43] <Xatenev> Cork: btw are you only doing javascript at work or u doing other stuff aswell? .p
[02:13:07] <Cork> Xatenev: js, php, ruby, rails, python, go, bash, ...
[02:13:19] <Cork> so ya, not just js
[02:13:26] <Xatenev> Cork: oh naise :p
[02:13:27] <Cork> and sometimes powershell
[02:13:42] <Cork> but i try to stay away from that if i can
[02:13:45] <Xatenev> Cork: so your more the fullstack guy :p
[02:14:00] <Cork> Xatenev: i run the projects from top to bottom yes
[02:14:29] <Cork> we usually divide on feature then layer
[02:14:42] <Cork> *nstead then on
[02:14:51] <Uhkis> you should really make your scripts sh-compatible ;)
[02:15:22] <Cork> Uhkis: sweet
[02:15:43] <Uhkis> bash sucks! :D
[02:15:59] <Cork> well ya, i'm not a fan
[02:16:04] <Cork> but it beats bat hands down
[02:16:05] <_eddy> Cork: I got in contact with the team who wrote the plugin then say that its in unix time
[02:16:20] <_eddy> so that "expires_in":2630000" is in unix time
[02:16:39] <Cork> that was kinda what i expected from the first comment :)
[02:16:43] <djam90> Cork, I am a little confused, sorry.. so if jQuery is doing it correctly, then why doesn't it work?
[02:16:46] <Cork> it was you who said it was a duration :)
[02:17:06] <_eddy> Cork: <::>
[02:17:16] <Cork> djam90: i haven't pointed the finger anywhere, all i've said is what it does
[02:17:22] <Cork> you would have to dig into why
[02:17:33] <Cork> i don't even have an ie8 browser at hand anymore
[02:17:37] <djam90> could it be because I am chaining the .after() ?
[02:17:43] <Cork> and debugging in ie8 is... ouch
[02:17:50] <Cork> djam90: no
[02:18:11] <Cork> djam90: start by veerifying each step
[02:18:20] <Cork> and make sure ie actually creates the dom structure you expect
[02:18:39] <tty> Cork: i included a main css and then using @import … i managed to load css. i left the js script tags on the partial. still 1ms flashing is visible on one of the two links
[02:18:48] <_eddy> Cork: what I dont understand is that  "expires_in":2630000" converted to real time is Sat, 31 Jan 1970 10:33:20 GMT
[02:19:07] <_eddy> and the  expire_time is 1426968383
[02:19:09] <Cork> tty: again, you can't prevent flashing of "nothing"
[02:19:17] <_eddy> is Sat, 21 Mar 2015 20:06:23 GMT
[02:19:34] <djam90> Cork, the thing is, the <div class="clear"> gets added in, the EXACT SAME WAY :(
[02:19:39] <Cork> tty: the flow is 1. original page starts to load, 2. original css is parsed and applied, 3. original js starts running
[02:19:49] <tty> it’s weird that on the pure html there is a flash while on the worpdress instance the flash is not visib.e
[02:19:56] <tty> at all
[02:19:59] <Cork> tty: 4. original js sends a network call for the partial, 5. page is rendered
[02:20:16] <Cork> 6. the new html is parsed and rendered
[02:20:28] <Cork> the time between 5 and 6 is your "flash"
[02:20:50] <Cork> tty: if you don't get a flash every time is just luck
[02:21:00] <Cork> as there is NOTHING in the browser promising this
[02:21:20] <tty> not sure if it is luck. i keep refreshing on the wordpress instance. no flashing.
[02:21:42] <Cork> tty: did you read my comments at all?
[02:21:52] <tty> yeap
[02:22:19] <djam90> Cork - I fixed it
[02:22:33] <Cork> if you do pure them you get 1. server renders a complete html stream 2. client gets the html, 3. parses it, 4. fetches css, 5. runs js, 6. shows page
[02:22:45] <Cork> there is no async ajax call in there to throw of the rendering guarantee
[02:23:08] <djam90> I changed the original:   $('<span class="timeslot-text">').text(item.description);     to  var timeSlotSpan = $('<span>').text(item.description).addClass('timeslot-text');  and it fixed it for IE8
[02:23:36] <Cork> djam90: ah ya you have invalid html in there
[02:23:49] <Cork> djam90: try ('<span class="timeslot-text"></span>')
[02:24:31] <Cork> jquery has special code to handle $('<[a-zA-Z0-9]+>')
[02:24:47] <Cork> and converts it to document.createElement('element-name')
[02:25:13] <Cork> while $('<span class="timeslot-text">') is just invalid html (not closed)
[02:29:30] <_eddy> Cork: I got one that will overload your head here
[02:30:10] <djam90> Cork I was under the impression that jQuery accepts non closing elements, as I was told there is no point doing $('<div></div>')  because $('<div>') does the same?
[02:30:50] <Cork> djam90: like i said it supports creating elements
[02:30:55] <Cork> but not none closing elements
[02:31:27] <djam90> ah I think I understand
[02:31:29] <Cork> meaning it supports $('<span>') or $('<span/>') but not $('<span anything>')
[02:31:40] <Cork> as the last one is html and not the special case jquery catches
[02:32:14] <_eddy> expires_in is 2630000" which  Sat, 31 Jan 1970 10:33:20 GMT and expire_time is 1426968383 which is Sat, 21 Mar 2015 20:06:23 GMT and today date is 19 FEB 2015 10:30:45 GMT. has you said before the device date might be wrong so I need to get the current date from the server again. so how do I do this now?
[02:33:23] <Cork> djam90: specifically it check for /^<(\w+)\s*\/?>(?:<\/\1>|)$/
[02:33:23] <djam90> ahh, I got it !
[02:33:32] <djam90> thanks Cork that makes sense
[02:34:19] <Cork> _eddy: not from the server
[02:34:29] <Cork> _eddy: when you get this date in the original get request
[02:34:40] <Cork> you should check against the current time of the client
[02:34:49] <Cork> to make sure it doesn't offset "too much"
[02:35:10] <_eddy> Cork: Remember I only want to run this request ONLY if the date/time has gone
[02:35:25] <Cork> _eddy: you will have to run it once when localstorage is blank
[02:35:43] <Cork> and that is the scenario i'm talking about right now
[02:35:59] <Cork> if the offset is "large" store what the offset is
[02:36:05] <_eddy> Cork: How do the localStorage becomes back?
[02:36:07] <Cork> and use that for the check
[02:36:20] <Cork> _eddy: its stored on disk locally
[02:36:47] <_eddy> Cork: I still cant understand your approach.
[02:36:51] <Cork> and the browsers pulls this data into ram before it starts rendering the page (and is why localstorage is a BAD idea for anything except small amount of data)
[02:38:05] <Cork> _eddy: for example you could have the server setting current time as it renders the original page
[02:38:08] <_eddy> Cork: its they only thing that you can use a session on an app
[02:38:15] <Cork> and when js starts compare it to local time
[02:38:28] <Cork> then you get an skew + network latency
[02:38:44] <Cork> from that you can verify that the clock is "close enough"
[02:38:54] <_eddy> Cork: wait.
[02:38:55] <Cork> or store a skew value
[02:39:47] <_eddy> The first time the app is launch from your phone what data should I get apart from the unix timestramp of the expiry_in and expire_time?
[02:40:04] <Cork> ah, is the html static?
[02:40:08] <Cork> on the phone?
[02:40:19] <_eddy> it is an APP not a website
[02:40:25] <Cork> ah, ya
[02:40:34] <Cork> not much you can do about the skew then
[02:41:10] <Cork> phones is almost always time synced with the carrier though
[02:41:16] <Cork> so should be ok
[02:41:27] <_eddy> yes thats why I need to use ajax again to get the time from the server
[02:41:34] <xaxaxaxa> how can i check in chrome what i send in post form. I dont see anything in Network tab
[02:41:34] <_eddy> that way I know it is always the right time
[02:41:35] <Cork> no you don't
[02:41:52] <Cork> _eddy: just store the expire time in localstorage
[02:41:59] <Cork> and compare it to the current time on next load
[02:42:10] <Cork> make sure to get utc and not local though :)
[02:43:19] <_eddy> Cork: it will be in this format 2015-02-19 08:07:37
[02:43:48] <Cork> didn't you say it was in unix time?
[02:44:01] <_eddy> Cork: it means I will be firing this get request everytime the app is launch
[02:44:08] <Cork> uh, no
[02:44:37] <_eddy> yes Cork Dont you need to covert it to understandable time?
[02:44:51] <_eddy> convert*
[02:44:56] <Cork> unix time is the most understandable time for computers
[02:45:07] <_eddy> cool
[02:45:10] <Cork> ...
[02:45:30] <Cork> just make sure the unix time is in utc and not server local
[02:45:56] <_eddy> lol how do i do that Cork?
[02:46:04] <_eddy> its in GMT
[02:46:06] <Cork> you would have to check the server code
[02:46:31] <_eddy> it should be
[02:46:41] <_eddy> it is a universal standard
[02:46:43] <Cork> well ya, gmt isn't exactly the same, but is often used as
[02:47:15] <_eddy> Cork: 1426968383 is that UTC?
[02:47:30] <Cork> ...
[02:47:36] <Cork> its a timestamp
[02:47:36] <Uhkis> :D
[02:47:40] <Cork> it doesn't have timezones
[02:47:55] <Cork> that is why i said you have to check the code
[02:47:59] <_eddy> my timezone is United Kingdom which we use GMT
[02:48:15] <Cork> if you get summer time, then it isn't utc
[02:48:19] <beasty> Cork: ! o/
[02:48:27] <Cork> if you never leave gmt then ya its utc
[02:48:57] <_eddy> Cork: well dont think my server will be going on a summer holiday lol
[02:49:45] <Cork> _eddy: uh summer time/time saving/what ever you want to call it
[02:50:09] <_eddy> our clock does go back and forward Cork
[02:50:18] <Cork> the annoying thing the world love to do where they shift the time one hour back/forwards
[02:50:30] <Cork> _eddy: then you're not on utc
[02:50:40] <Cork> and you will have calculation problem with clients
[02:51:08] <Cork> if the plugin isn't sending utc, but local time that is
[02:51:35] <_eddy> Cork: "The unix timestamp is timezone independent"
[02:51:50] <Cork> ya?
[02:52:01] <_eddy> that is what one of the plugin writer says
[02:52:27] <Cork> timestamp is number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 <pick your timezone>
[02:52:55] <Cork> timestamp doesn't by it self specify what timezone the start second is calculated from
[02:53:25] <_eddy> Cork: i will worry about later
[02:57:39] <_eddy> anyways Cork the first time a user downloads the app and opens it an ajax GET requests will run and get the app an access token. Which they will use to process something. The token is set to expiry in 30 days.
[02:59:02] <_eddy> this AJAX REQUESTS IS ONLY might to run ONLY if the access_token on the device localStorage has expiry. Which means I do not want to run this ajax request everytime
[02:59:20] <_eddy> just once every 30 days
[03:00:05] <_eddy> do you understand the scenarios Cork?
[03:00:30] <Cork> i'm understood the problem from the start
[03:00:42] <Cork> and i've told you how to solve it 3-5 times already
[03:01:27] <_eddy> Cork: you were talking to other so i didnt know if your response was directly towards me or not
[03:03:00] <hendry> I'm struggling to re-write this code as a function so I don't have this ugly indenting http://jsfiddle.net/0htpzao3/
[03:06:35] <Cork> hendry: i would go with the second version you had before
[03:07:00] <hendry> Cork: i don't like the ul list item stuff. Want to use an array of strings
[03:07:15] <Cork> the content doesn't belong in js though
[03:07:19] <Cork> it should be in the page
[03:08:38] <sacho> hendry, http://jsfiddle.net/2khfz3t0/
[03:09:04] <hendry> sacho: thank you!
[03:10:22] <Cork> hendry: anyway http://jsfiddle.net/0htpzao3/4/
[03:14:57] <_eddy> Cork: thanks anyways
[04:39:57] <kostodo> Is there a way to control where a datepicker pops up?
[04:40:07] <kostodo> Rather than always have it popping up under its input element?
[04:46:18] <Omar-> kostodo maybe http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-dialog "pos" option
[04:53:08] <[Non]> hello i want to use enter instead of tab for inputs
[04:53:10] <[Non]> is that possible?
[04:57:02] <converge> I have this variable var data = jQuery("#cadastro").serialize(); , how can I get the values inside data ?
[05:02:50] <Weethus> Hey guys; is there any way to make this work? It seems like newly-added buttons don't get updated during runtime, maybe a caching issue, maybe just my own fault for abusing the language? http://jsfiddle.net/g1ug1rd5/4/
[05:04:23] <Weethus> I had the idea to make fields editable (using input fields) on a click; but it doesn't seem like that is possible. (this image might add context; but the jsfiddle contains the problem as minimalistic as possible: https://imgur.com/0zphdgI)
[05:06:25] <samssh> Weethus, Your second handler (the one for #Cancel) gets created before #Cancel exists.
[05:08:15] <samssh> You will either need to attach the handler after creating the button, or use a delegated event handler on a parent.
[05:08:38] <Weethus> Oh, that was rather straightforward. Thanks (http://jsfiddle.net/g1ug1rd5/6/)
[05:10:18] <samssh> No problem
[05:27:00] <aro> where can i go for boostrap hel

[05:51:34] <jojovem> Hi all!
[05:51:43] <jojovem> im getting a weird issue with jquery.ajax
[05:51:56] <jojovem> The response is 200 OK but it only fires the complete deferrer not the done!
[05:55:14] <Voyage> For some ideas, anyone can thing of _small_ applications (web based or desktop based) that people might need these days? I am willing to make those for free for my publicity?
[05:58:25] <Cork> jojovem: cross domain?
[06:00:46] <jojovem> Cork: i just realized i wasnt chaining the right way :p
[06:00:48] <jojovem> Cork: sry
[06:03:29] <jojovem> Cork: do you know a way to force txt download through jquery so the browser doesnt output it, just download it?
[06:04:10] <Cork> jojovem: you could set the download attribute on the a tag
[06:04:30] <Cork> <a href="http://example.com/test.txt" download>
[06:04:32] <jojovem> Cork: so i make a temp a tag, trigger a click?
[06:04:37] <Cork> no
[06:04:44] <jojovem> there is no link
[06:04:51] <Xatenev> U guys used meteor already?
[06:04:51] <jojovem> im getting the file path by an ajax call
[06:05:03] <Cork> ah...
[06:05:04] <jojovem> i want to force the download in the ajax response
[06:05:14] <Cork> you don't really have a good option then
[06:05:30] <Cork> best is to present the link as a <a> tag
[06:05:44] <jojovem> Cork: what if i create it on the fly and trigger a click?
[06:05:49] <Cork> or you would have to do something nasty like faking the content-type server side
[06:06:02] <Cork> jojovem: you can't fake trusted events
[06:06:11] <Cork> so you would only fire possible js handlers on the tag
[06:06:16] <Cork> not the default action
[06:14:38] <dman777_alter> hello, is submitBtn = $('.modal .modal-footer button.submit') using the Multiple Selector or the class selector?
[06:15:50] <mbrzuzy> class
[06:17:26] <dman777_alter> mbrzuzy: it uses getElementsByClassName(), correct? How is it that it can find button.submit since getElementsByClassName() doesn't use tagName.className?
[06:18:47] <Cork> $('.modal .modal-footer button.submit') is basically the same as document.querySelectorAll('.modal .modal-footer button.submit')
[06:19:06] <Cork> except for the jquery wrapping of the result
[06:20:19] <dman777_alter> Cork: well, I need to expalin to someone what is going on with it. I agree, it's just like document.querySelectorAll(). But in the jquery docs it saids it uses getElementsByClassName()
[06:21:04] <Cork> dman777_alter: what the code does internally is literally document.querySelectorAll
[06:21:26] <dman777_alter> Cork: does it show that in docs somewhere? I need to prove it
[06:21:42] <mooncup> you can trust Cork
[06:21:48] <mooncup> he doesn't make things up too often
[06:21:54] <dman777_alter> I was looking at http://api.jquery.com/class-selector/
[06:22:09] <dman777_alter> I have to show some kind of proof for a PR review
[06:22:13] <Cork> the doc isn't a documentation of how it works internally
[06:22:18] <Cork> it explains how the api works
[06:22:28] <mooncup> ah fun times
[06:22:35] <Cork> and from that perspective it is meant to work exactly like selectors work in css
[06:22:53] <Cork> internally changes quite a lot over time
[06:23:04] <dman777_alter> Cork: why does the doc state "For class selectors, jQuery uses JavaScript's native getElementsByClassName()" ?
[06:23:50] <Cork> they probably talk about the speedup for pure selectors
[06:24:10] <Cork> though those aren't speedups in all modern browsers (querySelector is faster sometimes)
[06:24:41] <Cork> dman777_alter: but ex $('span') gets converted to document.getElementsByTagName
[06:24:59] <Cork> dman777_alter: but ex $('#some') gets converted to document.getElementById('some')
[06:25:17] <Cork> dman777_alter: but ex $('.class-name') gets converted to document.getElementsByClassName('class-name')
[06:25:26] <Cork> className can't ever handle a chain
[06:25:57] <Cork> dman777_alter: so  $('.modal .modal-footer button.submit') is always document.querySelectorAll('.modal .modal-footer button.submit')
[06:26:09] <dman777_alter> Cork: ya...ok. I guess I need to go throught the code to prove it uses document.querySelectorAll() unless the docs say it somewhere.
[06:26:13] <Cork> (except in older ie tha doesn't have querySelector, and uses document.all instead)
[06:26:16] <dman777_alter> s/thought/through
[06:26:29] <Cork> dman777_alter: have a look at sizzle
[06:26:33] <Cork> ?g sizzle
[06:26:33] <b-ot> Cork: Sizzle JavaScript Selector Library → http://sizzlejs.com/
[06:26:45] <Cork> ist what jquerys selector system is built ontop of
[06:28:02] <dman777_alter> thanks
[06:28:05] <Cork> dman777_alter: basically what jquery does was really hard if you go back a few years
[06:28:23] <Cork> but now days basically all of it has gotten moved into the dom
[06:28:48] <Cork> so it isn't at all that hard anymore (querySelectorAll was modelled after jquery)
[06:31:13] <v0lksman> hello all!  I can't seem to get this to animate to height 100%.  If I set animate to height: 'toggle' it animates as I would expect but collapses the container instead of increasing it to 100%...can anyone point me in the right direction?  http://jsfiddle.net/7fk7L7zw/
[06:41:35] <hasie> hey
[06:43:49] <Xatenev> heya
[06:43:57] <Xatenev> is there some way to download contents of div using jquery?
[06:44:05] <Xatenev> as PNG|JPG|PDF or something else - not as html though - ?
[06:44:22] <mooncup> doubtful
[06:44:30] <Xatenev> yea thought so
[06:44:30] <Xatenev> :p
[06:44:33] <Cork> Xatenev: what do you mean download?
[06:44:41] <Cork> you want it in js or actually save it?
[06:44:41] <Xatenev> Cork: Save as File
[06:44:47] <Cork> then not really
[06:44:49] <Xatenev> the user should save the file to his desktop
[06:44:49] <Xatenev> :P
[06:44:54] <Cork> set the url to window.location
[06:45:07] <Cork> except that will navigate away...
[06:45:17] <Xatenev> Cork: didnt get that1
[06:45:22] <Cork> ignore it
[06:45:23] <IamTryin_> How can i ping 8.8.8.8 from browser? (to verify ICMP ping is not blocked from that network)
[06:45:26] <Cork> it wasn't correct
[06:45:29] <Cork> IamTryin_: no
[06:45:44] <Cork> rather you can't from content space
[06:45:44] <IamTryin_> Cork: not possible? <a href="https://weknow.com" ping="8.8.8.8">
[06:45:54] <mooncup> could try this Xatenev http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/
[06:45:56] <Cork> that isn't ping :)
[06:46:06] <mooncup> idk how good it is tho
[06:46:18] <Cork> its a ping server that the browser offers to send a notification to that you clicked the link (for tracking)
[06:46:26] <Xatenev> mooncup: without a lib
[06:46:32] <Xatenev> mooncup: i already found a lot of libs :p
[06:46:48] <IamTryin_> OK - Cork, but how is it possible then to find out if ICMP to our server is blocked or not?
[06:46:49] <Cork> Xatenev: only options is to offer a link for them to click
[06:46:58] <Cork> IamTryin_: you can't
[06:47:03] <mooncup> I doubt you could do it natively
[06:47:24] <mooncup> well not very quickly anyewaway
[06:47:26] <Cork> IamTryin_: that could be used to scan internal networks, and that would be a BAD thing
[06:47:28] <mooncup> anyway
[06:47:37] <IamTryin_> Flash plugin or (i hate to say Java applet ) ?
[06:47:43] <Cork> ya
[06:47:54] <Cork> both are possible if the client has it enabled
[06:47:56] <IamTryin_> OK - thank you Cork, will try Flash
[06:48:02] <IamTryin_> (hate Java)
[06:48:09] <Cork> (hate both)
[06:48:17] <IamTryin_> :LOL
[06:48:19] <Xatenev> Ah
[06:48:20] <mooncup> ^
[06:48:27] <Xatenev> Cork: i will just open a print popup now
[06:48:32] <Betal> there is a table divided by pages, is possible to download from each page the table content?, like each link have a page part and make it a big table?
[06:48:32] <Xatenev> where users can decide whether they wanna save or print
[06:48:33] <mooncup> its ok Cork
[06:48:36] <Xatenev> ty for help
[06:48:41] <mooncup> another year or 2 and flash will be dead :D
[06:48:56] <mooncup> and java applets are already basically dead
[06:48:58] <Cork> mooncup: in you're dreams
[06:49:03] <Betal> have a table* part
[06:49:30] <mooncup> Cork: once all the video sites move over to html5 surely it will jut be games?
[06:49:43] <Cork> mooncup: you're forgetting streaming
[06:49:55] <mooncup> oh
[06:49:56] <mooncup> :<
[06:50:07] <mooncup> does youtube not stream with html5?
[06:50:14] <Cork> no
[06:50:16] <mooncup> I thought it was the standard now
[06:50:20] <Xatenev> youtube got both
[06:50:21] <Xatenev> html5 and flash
[06:50:29] <Xatenev> u can choose from what i know
[06:51:00] <Xatenev> Twitch is aswell going onto HLS (http live streaming)
[06:51:47] <Cork> ya, and it requires flash
[06:51:54] <Xatenev> does it o>o?
[06:52:04] <Cork> well if you want it in the browser yes
[06:52:21] <Cork> chrome has a built in hls plugin i think
[06:52:27] <Cork> but it isn't web standrd
[06:52:31] <Xatenev> hmo k
[06:52:31] <Cork> *standard
[06:52:41] <mooncup> fuckn adobe
[06:52:50] <mooncup> tis interesting though really
[06:52:56] <Cork> there is ongoing work for adding that part though
[06:53:04] <mooncup> say what you want about steve jobs, but he did a damned good job promoting html5
[06:53:09] <Cork> there is lots of interesting goodies in the pipe :)
[06:53:11] <mooncup> even if it was for selfish reasons
[06:53:31] <Cork> mooncup: except they didn't really promote "html5"
[06:53:49] <Cork> and again "html5" is among the most meaningless works you can use

[07:02:11] <IamTryin_> Cork: i am not sure. can you use Google Chrome extensions to get the ping to be done via locally? for example: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/ping
[07:02:49] <Cork> IamTryin_: not sure about chrome extensions, yes that is a way
[07:03:14] <Cork> chrome extensions is quite limited to in what they can do
[07:03:36] <IamTryin_> OK - ic ( all of them doing it from remote server https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/ping)
[07:03:40] <Cork> those ping extensions might relay on a web service
[07:03:50] <Cork> ya, suspected as much
[07:03:55] <IamTryin_> YES - they are doing from server, which i do not want.
[07:04:00] <IamTryin_> OK - never mind thanks a lot !!
[07:04:03] <Cork> IamTryin_: in contrast i know firefox extensions can do it
[07:04:17] <Cork> but they can basically any local library on the system so...
[07:04:25] <Cork> *basically call any
[07:04:31] <IamTryin_> OK - then Chrome must because i can already use Chrome to access RS232
[07:04:37] <IamTryin_> Ping must be then possible
[07:05:18] <pmcgovern> Good morning everyone
[07:06:24] <pmcgovern> I want a form to submit via $.post... easy enough.  If the redsponse comes back with errors, I want to populate field-specific error text. What is the most sane / easy way to approach this form a jquery perspective?
[07:07:27] <Cork> pmcgovern: if you get json back just map the field name with the json key
[07:07:54] <Cork> and then grab the related (sibling?) error field and put in the text /create the element
[07:10:48] <pmcgovern> Cork got it. Thanks

[07:20:30] <Skyler_White> So much to learn,only recently started javascript..when should i start thinking about jquery
[07:30:19] <Gsham> im loading a lightbox script on my wordpress site. I made sure jquery loads before it. i get undefined is not a function
[07:30:27] <Gsham> if i run the function in the console it works
[07:30:34] <Gsham> so why wont it work when the page loads
[07:48:10] <BillCriswell> Skyler_White: When you're comfortable with the basics of Javascript.
[07:49:24] <BillCriswell> Gsham: Are you loading the content you're trying to apply the light box to through ajax?
[07:49:37] <Gsham> i got it working thanks
[07:50:38] <BillCriswell> No problem.

[08:15:39] <Squarism> how should i interpret : (function($) { ...body... })(jQuery);
[08:16:02] <BillCriswell> Squarism: It's just a safe way to use $ without in conflicting with anything else.

[08:24:08] <JohnDow> ok ok im sorry, so i have downloaded a js file, but i just need to edit it a bit... the problem is i only know how to use it but i dont know how it works
[08:24:24] <JohnDow> it's a form validation js file
[08:25:10] <JohnDow> my forms is at its place at first, even when it show the error
[08:25:28] <JohnDow> the problem is, when the problem is solved... the form is out of place

[08:36:14] <JohnDow> ok, aside from you.... is there anyone who can help in form validation?
[08:36:19] <Omar-> create a fiddle to clarify your problem to others
[08:36:44] <JohnDow> ok
[08:37:57] <Omar-> JohnDow i guess the majority are experienced with http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[08:39:00] <JohnDow> i tried using jsfiddle, but i dont know how to put the javascript in there.... cause it's not only on a one are of my html

[08:50:42] <Beg> How would I get an img src and uplaod it in a post?
[08:52:04] <robertmaxrees> you can get the src attribute of an image by use .attr() or .prop(), depending on your needs.
[08:52:09] <Omar-> $("img").attr("src")
[08:52:12] <robertmaxrees> you can then send that string along to your server
[08:52:21] <Beg> I want to upload the image to my server
[08:52:47] <Beg> I don't want to fetch the image on the server
[08:52:50] <robertmaxrees> https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[08:52:55] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this, then.
[08:53:03] <robertmaxrees> since file uploads are kind of a funky thing.
[08:53:35] <Beg> hmm, then I guess I'll just skip it :>
[08:53:50] <Beg> Not worth the time for this small project
[08:54:18] <Beg> Thanks robertmaxrees and the all you guys .)
[08:54:27] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty easy to do without ajax.  but the ajax part makes older browsers weird.
[08:54:58] <Dirkos> How can i read a json response with an @ in it?
[08:55:11] <robertmaxrees> my reading it.  @ is a valid char is JSON.
[08:55:22] <Dirkos> SyntaxError: illegal character 	  loadAverages.push(data.Vitals.@attributes.LoadAvg);
[08:55:35] <robertmaxrees> vitals['@attributes']
[08:55:57] <robertmaxrees> more specifically, loadAverages.push(data.Vitals['@attributes'].LoadAvg);
[08:56:56] <Dirkos> robertmaxrees: thanks
[08:58:34] <Omar-> why cloned images looks weird? http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/qhrc9fwt/3/
[08:59:30] <Omar-> click any image until you see cloned images to the right stuck to each other unlike the hard coded ones
[08:59:49] <robertmaxrees> that's not working for me at all fwiw.
[09:00:21] <Omar-> the div isn't scrolling to left?
[09:00:33] <robertmaxrees> oh that.
[09:00:38] <Omar-> :@
[09:02:18] <Omar-> first 10 images have margin between, the 10 cloned at the end have no margin
[09:02:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah i see that.
[09:02:37] <Omar-> I just cloned them $(".wrapper img").clone(true).appendTo(".wrapper");
[09:02:50] <Omar-> with and without "true"
[09:05:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qhrc9fwt/5/ simplified down
[09:05:07] <robertmaxrees> hrmm....
[09:08:49] <Omar-> same same
[09:08:51] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qhrc9fwt/6/ it just gets weirder.
[09:09:20] <Omar-> css or js bug?
[09:09:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qhrc9fwt/7/
[09:09:31] <Omar-> will test it in FF
[09:09:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm in FF>
[09:10:29] <Omar-> i'm in chrome
[09:10:42] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/upcknw3z/
[09:11:01] <robertmaxrees> don't use $.each() for jquery objects btw.
[09:11:09] <Omar-> why?
[09:11:27] <Omar-> "for" better?
[09:11:29] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/ - "The $.each() function is not the same as $(selector).each(),..."
[09:11:39] <robertmaxrees> just use $(".wrapper img").each(function() {
[09:11:46] <Omar-> ohhh ok
[09:11:53] <cphyc> hi, I am working with frames and I wanted to know whether it was possible to use the jquery draggable (from ui) to drag from one frame to the other one ?
[09:11:58] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[09:12:10] <Omar-> hi arthurvr
[09:12:15] <Omar-> long time
[09:12:15] <robertmaxrees> hey arthurvr - got a weird one for you :)
[09:12:35] <arthurvr> Shoot.

[09:13:12] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: expected behaviour?
[09:13:21] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[09:13:38] <Omar-> spot the difference and win a trip to Disney land
[09:13:39] <Omar-> :P
[09:14:31] <arthurvr> w00t
[09:14:40] <shoky> spaces between images?
[09:14:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[09:14:45] <arthurvr> ya
[09:14:48] <arthurvr> w00t
[09:14:48] <shoky> cloned ones don't have a space between them
[09:14:55] <robertmaxrees> why is that?
[09:15:04] <shoky> "<img/> <img/>"  vs "<img/></img/>"
[09:15:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qhrc9fwt/13/
[09:15:26] <robertmaxrees> hah - wowzer.
[09:15:38] <robertmaxrees> aaaah yeah - ionline elements.
[09:15:43] <robertmaxrees> *inline.  makes sense.
[09:15:48] <Omar-> good one shoky
[09:16:00] <kostasx_> Hello, guys. I am currently using an IIFE to enable the $ jQuery shortcut in a jQuery(window).load(). Is there any other way of enabling the $ shortcut there?
[09:16:05] <Omar-> but they have display: inline;
[09:16:22] <shoky> and spaces matter in a line ;p
[09:16:32] <robertmaxrees> kostasx_ turn off noconflict mode.
[09:16:53] <robertmaxrees> kostasx_ you can also do jQuery(function($) {}); for a document ready replacement.
[09:16:54] <Omar-> so float: left is better
[09:18:19] <Omar-> float: left breaks the design
[09:20:53] <Omar-> shall I add a &nbsp; after each clone?
[09:25:28] <shoky> Omar- there are many different ways to solve it, each with its own drawbacks.. do you need IE<10 support
[09:25:50] <kostasx_> Thanks robertmaxrees. I really need the code inside a window.load. The noConfict does the trick also. Thanks!
[09:26:09] <Omar-> shoky honestly, I'm just playing around. practicing and killing time :)
[09:27:15] <kostasx_> robertmaxtree I was wondering whether jQuery(window).load, has some way of passing the $ object in the callback function just like jQuery(function($){}.
[09:27:38] <Omar-> shoky robertmaxrees dirty fix http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/qhrc9fwt/15/
[09:27:41] <shoky> Omar- oks well i wouldn't depend on the inline space for having space between your images. i'd put a margin on the images and work from there
[09:28:38] <Omar-> shoky yup, I've added a margin. I cloned hard coded images, appended them and then removed them
[09:28:46] <robertmaxrees> kostasx_ you really should just turn off noconflict if you don't need it on.  you might be able to use jQuery(window).load(function($) {}); , but i'm not entirely sure.
[09:29:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah that won't work - you'll need the IIFE.
[09:29:56] <Omar-> now the challenge how to scroll left/right depending on clicked img position between it's siblings and total wrapper width.
[09:30:16] <kostasx_> One more thing. It seems that it's been ages since I last used IRC. How do I mention you on my IRC message? Such an IRC noob! (lol)
[09:31:34] <robertmaxrees> by... typing my name out?
[09:32:10] <kostasx_> robertmaxtrees Oh! Just that. I thought there was somekind of command for that. Thanks again!
[09:32:20] <Evolutio> Hello
[09:32:30] <robertmaxrees> most clients offer an autocomplete feature of some kind.
[09:33:06] <robertmaxrees> kostasx_ so you can start typing a username and then hit tab.

[09:35:43] <Evolutio> http://arborjs.org/ look at this, the plugin i search has more "nodes" and when you hover on it, the nodes move
[09:35:55] <Beg> robertmaxrees: thx

[09:38:29] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?  does http://arborjs.org/ have the behavior you're looking for?
[09:39:08] <Evolutio> no
[09:39:29] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what that page has to do with anything then >.>
[09:49:56] <Evolutio> I give it up :/
[09:51:28] <NoiseEee> Evolutio: well i don't know what kind of answer you're expecting from "im looking for a plugin but i forget the name and where i saw it"
[09:51:43] <Evolutio> that's right
[09:51:56] <robertmaxrees> and then you don't tell us anything about what it does.
[09:52:34] <Evolutio> it looks like a nodes visualization, when you hover over the nodes with your mouse, the nodes move around
[09:52:46] <robertmaxrees> why can't you use the one that was on that page, then?
[09:53:11] <Evolutio> I don't know that page
[09:53:21] <robertmaxrees> look at the page source - it tells you :)
[09:53:34] <Evolutio> yes, that's right! But i dont know the page

[09:55:29] <Evolutio> yes, i know the arbor.js lib, but that's the wrong
[09:55:49] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're saying the one you're looking for is similar to arbor.js.

[10:02:39] <dandaman> is there a listener for when an element is scrolled into the user's viewport?

[10:51:04] <imjakechapman> Hey everyone. Question, I have an input in backbone. On my iphone it only will allow me to put in 1 character then stops allowing typing. Desktop this doesn't happen. Anyone run into this issue before?
[10:55:58] <s2013> anyone used waypoints?
[10:56:17] <robertmaxrees> lots of people.
[10:56:45] <s2013> ok lots of people.. is there a way to only trigger it once per page load?
[10:56:47] <s2013> instead of everytime
[10:56:51] <s2013> cant seem to find it in the docs
[10:57:05] <robertmaxrees> "once per page load instead of every time"?
[10:57:16] <robertmaxrees> once per page load instead of every page load?
[10:57:19] <s2013> meaning, everytime i scroll to that, it shouldnt be tiggered
[10:57:34] <s2013> should be triggered the first time only
[10:58:02] <robertmaxrees> the code for a waypoint, or the entire initialization?
[10:59:23] <s2013> http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/api/waypoint/
[10:59:31] <robertmaxrees> you're not being clear about what you need.
[10:59:32] <s2013> if you scroll down youll see the green alerts on the right
[10:59:40] <s2013> if you scroll back up and scroll down it will show up again
[10:59:43] <robertmaxrees> okay
[10:59:44] <s2013> basically i need it to be once
[11:00:02] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to store state somewhere and check that.
[11:00:46] <s2013> i was wondering if there was something built into waypoints that handled that
[11:01:17] <s2013> if not, i can do it, but if somethings built in, makes it easier
[11:01:26] <robertmaxrees> looks like all waypoints does is run a function when you hit a waypoint.  you could always disable the waypoint after activating it maybe?
[11:02:37] <s2013> yeah i can take it off that
[11:02:41] <simon> hi. can anyone tell me why this $.ajax request does not invoke its .done handler in spite of it successfully executing? http://cadm.dk/simon/controversy-mapping/emil-1-test.html

[11:04:45] <robertmaxrees> it's doing the .done() call.
[11:04:52] <simon> oh - I'm using firefox. this actually works in Chrome!
[11:05:02] <simon> it seems like a bug, to be honest.
[11:05:04] <robertmaxrees> the code works as written in ff, too.
[11:05:07] <robertmaxrees> what does?
[11:05:13] <simon> robertmaxrees, it works in your firefox?
[11:05:20] <robertmaxrees> you're calling a url and then writing it to the page.
[11:05:24] <simon> yup.
[11:05:29] <simon> just a demo.
[11:05:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that works.
[11:05:53] <simon> oh man. I have to figure out why my firefox is messed up. :(
[11:06:06] <s2013> speaking of ajax, does anyone know of any open apis where you dont need to register as a dev or anything
[11:06:12] <s2013> would be useful for hte class im teaching
[11:06:14] <robertmaxrees> open your console/network tabs and see if you're getting errors, simon
[11:06:20] <simon> robertmaxrees, I'm not!
[11:06:37] <robertmaxrees> simon try attaching the .fail() callback and see what that tells you then.
[11:06:38] <s2013> checked your network tab simon ?
[11:06:41] <simon> robertmaxrees, the reason it got this far is because I'm trying to deal with another XHR bug in *my* firefox (but apparently not in everyone else's)
[11:07:03] <simon> s2013, I'm actually *getting* the XHR, but the .done action just isn't invoked.
[11:07:10] <simon> s2013, I can see the XHR taking place in my console.
[11:07:15] <s2013> hmm
[11:07:21] <robertmaxrees> simon check the .fail() callback.
[11:07:27] <simon> robertmaxrees, I did try .fail() too, but no action. I'm getting a 200, too.
[11:07:38] <robertmaxrees> .fail() can invoke in a lot of cases.
[11:07:39] <simon> I'll try my other computer.
[11:07:45] <robertmaxrees> even if you're getting 200s.
[11:07:50] <simon> it didn't invoke here.
[11:08:17] <s2013> simon, are you looking for "this is a test" text ?
[11:09:12] <simon> on my mac's firefox, it also does not fire the .done() event. robertmaxrees, does it really write "This is a test." at the bottom on your firefox?
[11:09:24] <s2013> simon, ^
[11:09:31] <simon> s2013, yes!
[11:09:40] <robertmaxrees> ah.  i see.
[11:09:41] <s2013> yeah it doesnt work for me on ff either
[11:09:45] <robertmaxrees> i am not getting that.
[11:09:47] <simon> s2013, but on chrome?
[11:09:48] <s2013> i do get a warning though
[11:09:49] <robertmaxrees> don't use document.write()
[11:09:50] <robertmaxrees> use .append()
[11:09:52] <s2013> works on chrome
[11:09:55] <simon> s2013, what warning? I'm not getting any warning.
[11:10:01] <simon> robertmaxrees, yeah, that was just for testing.
[11:10:04] <s2013> Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead.
[11:10:19] <robertmaxrees> don't use it for anything - that might be causing your headaches.
[11:10:23] <robertmaxrees> use .append() instead.
[11:10:26] <s2013> does console.log work?
[11:10:31] <s2013> in .done()
[11:10:37] <s2013> console.log(data);
[11:11:11] <simon> I'll try.
[11:12:05] <simon> nope.
[11:12:08] <simon> but it does on chrome.
[11:12:17] <s2013> im also getting another error on ff when i try ot paste the code in the console
[11:12:20] <s2013> $.ajax not defined
[11:12:22] <simon> (I replaced the document.write with a console.log and it didn't affect the outcome)
[11:12:32] <simon> oh...
[11:12:33] <s2013> sorry TypeError: $.ajax is not a function
[11:12:45] <s2013> but not on chrome
[11:12:48] <s2013> im guessing something to do with that
[11:12:49] <robertmaxrees> that'll be another issue.
[11:12:54] <simon> maybe this has to do with dynamic loading and scoping?
[11:12:57] <robertmaxrees> your loadscript code doesn't work the way you think it does.
[11:13:06] <simon> robertmaxrees, I bet it doesn't!
[11:13:16] * simon admits to having copy-pasted and only modified it slightly.
[11:13:20] <robertmaxrees> try adding those scrips directly to the page instead.
[11:13:30] <s2013> also if you are using $.ajax dont you need to specificy the type? get/post
[11:13:33] <simon> robertmaxrees, I can't. single embed code.
[11:13:44] <simon> robertmaxrees, if I add them directly, that solves the problem, but I'm restricted from doing that.
[11:14:20] <robertmaxrees> hold up - why the single embed code?
[11:14:22] <simon> should I, like, use something like RequireJS that knows what it's doing?
[11:14:46] <Valduare> hey guys, im building a step by step guide to show the user what step they are on. similar to those used in shopping carts.    what is this called I cant find any guides on google search heh
[11:15:07] <simon> robertmaxrees, because it'll be copy-pasted into various places and people are currently doing this. there's a lot of human error and really weird CMS rules that dictate this constraint.
[11:15:25] <robertmaxrees> simon then require won't fix that because you have to include two separate things.
[11:15:27] <simon> (I call them rules, but they're bugs.)
[11:16:06] <robertmaxrees> Valduare we just call them "checkout steps".
[11:16:22] <simon> robertmaxrees, can you tell me how this dynamic loading code works in the way that I don't think it does?
[11:16:33] <Valduare> ty
[11:16:34] <robertmaxrees> it injects script tags but doesn't wait for them to finish loading.
[11:17:14] <simon> robertmaxrees, so the $(document).ready code might even be executed before $ is loaded.
[11:17:21] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[11:17:35] <robertmaxrees> as far as I can tell - you need to find something a little more robust.
[11:17:59] <simon> robertmaxrees, I just thought 'script.onload = callback' would do the trick?
[11:18:53] <robertmaxrees> this is all code smell imo - what CMS are you using?
[11:18:57] <robertmaxrees> what's the bug you're working around?
[11:19:49] <litropy> Hi, all - the following paste is a tidbit (actually most of) the plugin flowtype.js. My question is, within this code, by the time it gets to var "changes", has "options" already overridden var "settings"? http://jsbin.com/heqimunomo/2/
[11:19:55] <Valduare> im trying this if (jQuery(".stepbystep").is(":contains('Register/Login')")) {     and then addClass    but its not working…
[11:20:34] <litropy> And is this a standard function of jquery plugins? Because I don't see the code where "options" override "settings"
[11:21:33] <Es0teric> quick question -- if i use window.location to redirect the user somewhere on a submit button click would it still retain all the post data?
[11:21:37] <robertmaxrees> litropy i don't see any code there.
[11:21:55] <MikeD_> Es0teric: no
[11:22:07] <litropy> btw, the noatation for flowtype looks like $("#maincontainer").flowtype({ fontRatio : 45, minFontv : 16, maxFont : 24 });
[11:22:08] <simon> okay, so I've tried a bunch of things. basically, I'd have to ask some dozens of computer illiterates to access a half-broken CMS, enter a new set of codes (involving four <script> tags rather than one). but many of these script tags will end up on the same page and get included several times. in one script I can prevent this from happening by controlling the global namespace. but I'm not even that far, because currently $.ajax won't work in firefox.
[11:22:12] <litropy> robertmaxrees, hmmm hang on
[11:22:13] <Es0teric> MikeD_ how do i make it retain all the post data then?
[11:22:39] <MikeD_> post your data, _then_ go somewhere else
[11:22:46] <Es0teric> wait what?
[11:22:57] <_eddy> what on earth is a jsonp
[11:23:09] <litropy> robertmaxrees, all, try http://jsbin.com/heqimunomo/2/edit?html,js,output
[11:23:11] <Valduare> robertmaxrees: is my syntax right?
[11:23:23] <litropy> sorry this is the first time I've pasted using jsbin
[11:23:24] <simon> robertmaxrees, should 'scriptTag.onload = callbackFunction' not be sufficient to indicate that the script tag is loaded?
[11:25:12] <litropy> robertmaxrees, all, and if that doesn't work, let's revert to what I know: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10312471/
[11:25:26] <robertmaxrees> i gotta ditch out for a few, folks.
[11:25:31] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[11:26:11] <litropy> robertBusy, you know you're the best. Have a good day.
[11:26:56] <simon> does anyone here have an idea as to why $.ajax does't work in this dynamically loaded script on firefox, but works well on chrome?
[11:28:26] <_eddy> simon: do you have document ready?
[11:29:08] <simon> _eddy, http://cadm.dk/simon/controversy-mapping/emil-1-test.html - my firebug console suggests that the $.ajax-requested document indeed 200 OKs, but no sign of the .done callback.
[11:29:25] <simon> _eddy, I tried adding a .fail callback, but it doesn't get invoked either.
[11:29:32] <simon> one sec, I'll add it back.
[11:29:34] <sukima> How do I test if a select has or does not have the multiple attribute?
[11:29:56] <_eddy> sukima: array?
[11:30:08] <_eddy> then check the array to see how many values in it
[11:31:01] <sukima> _eddy: was specificly looking to see if the element was declared as a multi select or not. I don't care about the values. Is your sugesstion help that?
[11:31:04] <litropy> Ah. Found my answer. Yes, they do get overridden.http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/
[11:31:07] * sukima runs to jsbin.com
[11:32:03] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm trying to figure out how I can store a jquery object of arrays in a hidden input field in my form. I'm using the hidden field as a storage repository of accumulated values to post upon form submit. The backend will loop through each of the entries for processing. Here's my code: pretty straight forward: http://jsfiddle.net/o3vhudp9/
[11:32:35] <doug16k> simon, document.write? seriously?
[11:32:57] <simon> checkit, without the intention of complicating your life, ideally you have a model that is independent of your view (the form).
[11:33:12] <doug16k> why do you do that completely ancient thing?
[11:33:38] <simon> doug16k, it's a thing my fingers do when I'm debugging.
[11:33:41] <doug16k> +'ing together a bunch of html is not maintainable
[11:34:10] <checkit> simon: Ideally, yes... Currently no AJAX and client doesn't want each modal submit to post and refresh page. So, need to collect all dynamic data, somehow store and make part of the final submit, parse on backend and process...
[11:34:43] <simon> _eddy, any ideas?
[11:34:53] <sukima> _eddy: Got it: http://jsbin.com/deluro/1/edit?js,console
[11:35:28] <doug16k> simon, does that script loader work? you see those onload callbacks happening?
[11:35:39] <simon> doug16k, yes.
[11:35:41] <Uhkis> sukima: use prop() instead
[11:35:49] <_eddy> simon: second answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3243476/how-to-get-multiple-select-box-values-using-jquery
[11:35:52] <doug16k> you're sure it makes it to the code that calls $.ajax?
[11:35:55] <NoiseEee> simon: perhaps you shouldn't be re-inventing script loading.  see http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html or http://browserify.org/
[11:35:57] <simon> doug16k, those document.writes get called. even the $.ajax gets called. just no .done callback
[11:36:07] <sukima> Uhkis: Oh snap thanls!
[11:36:29] <simon> NoiseEee, I might have to resort to requirejs and see if that solves it. but can you tell me why "this sort of script loading" makes $.ajax break?
[11:37:12] <sukima> +1 browserify!
[11:37:15] <doug16k> simon, mine says ajax coming through
[11:37:20] <simon> _eddy, second answer?
[11:37:23] <simon> doug16k, firefox or chrome?
[11:37:27] <doug16k> chrome
[11:37:35] <simon> doug16k, try firefox. :) it works in my chrome, too.
[11:38:09] <jeffreylevesque> I was watching 'The Walking Dead', and thought about making an iris detection program.  But, oh no, the walkers could use it
[11:38:21] <simon> somehow this homemade JS loading breaks $.ajax on firefox. I'm curious as to why. if nobody knows, I'll see if requirejs solves it.
[11:39:25] <doug16k> simon, if you document.write after the load of the page is finished, it wipes the page and starts a new one
[11:39:36] <doug16k> dont use document.write, it is obsolete garbage
[11:39:39] <simon> the thing is... I tried removing this entire JS loading crap and just concatenate all my dependencies together. and the $.ajax does the same thing. :(
[11:39:39] <Dr-007> good evening, i'm trying to jump out of an animation that is calling itself but with a setTimeout. the jumping out part happends under a stop button that tries to clearTimeout(nametimeout); but since this function is calling itself a few times this timeout id gets overwritten numerous times. anyway, i cant 'jump out'. any suggestions?
[11:39:45] <snover> why would you ever make your own module loader
[11:39:51] <doug16k> simon, the load finishes long before the loader finishes
[11:39:54] <Dr-007> i thought of keeping not of my timeout id's via an array
[11:40:01] <Dr-007> *note
[11:40:03] <simon> doug16k, was that the third or fourth time you said that? ;) so long as it's not causing the problem, I'm going to settle with using it for debugging things.
[11:40:17] <doug16k> simon, I just told you that is was causing the problem
[11:40:19] <snover> maybe do it to learn how you can load things into an asynchronous environment, but then delete the code and use something that exists and is production-ready
[11:40:25] <simon> doug16k, what do you mean by the load finishes long before the loader finishes?
[11:40:37] <doug16k> if you document.write AFTER the page is finished loading then document.write wipes the page
[11:40:38] <simon> doug16k, document.write is causing the problem? wow. ok. two secs.
[11:40:57] <MikeD_> document.write IS a problem
[11:41:06] <simon> oh god. *facepalms*
[11:41:14] <simon> I think I owe you an apology, doug16k ;)
[11:41:19] <doug16k> the browser doesnt mind-read that you arent finsihed until a bunch of random delays while loading scripts
[11:41:49] <doug16k> simon, this is on reason why document.write is hated so much
[11:41:52] <doug16k> one*
[11:42:04] <simon> I remember this very vaguely.
[11:42:07] <doug16k> it completely changes semantics depending on when you call it. a terrible api
[11:43:00] <doug16k> simon, you already use createElement for the script loader, why not use it for that <style> tag too
[11:43:19] <doug16k> then dcument.write disappears and nobody yells at you for using it and bug is fixed :D
[11:43:23] <snover> why not use a real module loader instead of trying to reinvent your own
[11:43:38] <simon> snover, I'll grow up to do that after this! :)
[11:43:41] <simon> doug16k, yeah, ok. thanks.
[11:43:43] <snover> i promise you’re going to do a worse job
[11:46:20] <simon> doug16k, I owe you. got a bitcoin tipping address?
[11:46:38] <doug16k> simon, no
[11:46:52] <doug16k> glad to help
[11:51:06] <mezod> what could be wrong with a jquery snippet that sometimes works and sometimes doesn?t
[11:51:15] <robertBusy> share the code.
[11:51:21] <robertBusy> sounds like a race condition
[11:51:37] <MikeD_> it could be evil aliens, but it's probably not.
[11:52:40] <mezod> http://pastie.org/9963514
[11:52:53] <robertBusy> what about it "doesn't work"
[11:53:06] <mezod> the class isn't added
[11:53:11] <mezod> when I hover
[11:53:15] <robertBusy> is that in a document ready?
[11:53:19] <robertBusy> is that element added after page load?
[11:53:20] <robertBusy> etc.
[11:53:25] <mezod> yes
[11:57:04] <mezod> when it doesn't work i can see class="" getting added to the dom
[11:57:11] <mezod> but without the classname
[11:57:33] <robertBusy> i usually avoid using toggles fwiw.  addclass and removeclass explicitly tend to be a little more reliable in my experience.
[11:58:11] <mezod> yeah I'm learning that javascript and reliability don't really get along
[11:58:14] <mezod> :p
[11:58:19] <robertBusy> javascript can be plenty reliable.
[11:58:31] <robertBusy> implicit code can bite you.
[11:59:37] <simon> doug16k, so is it the entire semantics of "the current place of insertion" being around where the original <script> is that is completely outdated?
[11:59:52] <mezod> aha still, kinda funny that a lang does weird shit continously :p
[12:00:07] <robertBusy> mezod js hardly does anything "weird" for m.e
[12:00:39] <mezod> internet fight!!
[12:00:46] <robertBusy> huh?
[12:00:57] <doug16k> simon, your problem is, those script loads are all run sequentially, so there are several delays. a while after the page load, that last script load calback happens. at that point the page is loaded, and after the load finishes, document.write will wipe the page and start a new one
[12:01:09] <mezod> how shall I understand "toggleClass" is not that reliable :p
[12:01:25] <robertBusy> mezod it's implicit.  you could have that class added by something else.
[12:01:37] <robertBusy> maybe you think it should be adding it on mouseenter when instead it's removing it.
[12:01:38] <robertBusy> etc.
[12:02:04] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm trying to figure out how I can store a jquery object of arrays in a hidden input field in my form. I'm using the hidden field as a storage repository of accumulated values to post upon form submit. The backend will loop through each of the entries for processing. Here's my code: pretty straight forward: http://jsfiddle.net/o3vhudp9/
[12:02:25] <robertBusy> "a jquery object of arrays"?
[12:03:00] <robertBusy> checkit that's just a plain old object.
[12:03:03] <checkit> robertBusy: Checkout the fiddle... I'm probably phrasing that bit incorrectly.
[12:03:13] <draconusdesigns> I have a silly question...
[12:03:21] <draconusdesigns> http://www.suumit.com/projects/bsmSelect/examples/index.html
[12:03:23] <checkit> robertBusy: Right right...
[12:03:31] <robertBusy> checkit you're trying to push into strings...
[12:03:34] <draconusdesigns> Example one is what I want to have in my application.
[12:04:00] <robertBusy> wait wut
[12:04:02] <robertBusy> something here seems off.
[12:04:08] <draconusdesigns> But the problem is, that it doesn't save the sort order in any way, so it is time to write my own i suppose.
[12:04:25] <checkit> robertBusy: Just need to get it back my form somehow so I can post and parse on the server side for processing.
[12:04:30] <checkit> Prefereably as JSON.
[12:04:34] <robertBusy> this seems really awkward.
[12:04:40] <draconusdesigns> Does anyone have something similar already to save the headache? Multiselect to sortable list like this?
[12:05:01] <robertBusy> checkit http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o3vhudp9/1/
[12:05:07] <robertBusy> this should get you started.
[12:05:26] <guzzlefry> Is there an easy way to use an icon in place of a file input element?
[12:05:56] <simon> doug16k, so a recommendation like http://stackoverflow.com/a/19757717/235908 doesn't work in my case.
[12:06:17] <checkit> robertBusy: Oh... You changed var saving = {}....
[12:06:25] <robertBusy> checkit yeah.
[12:06:30] <robertBusy> you want an object there, not an array.
[12:07:40] <doug16k> simon, why do you insist on using document.write. I'm not interested in hacking together a way that lets you use it
[12:08:27] <doug16k> that is a technique that is used for ad injection. ad people want it to work all the way back to the first browser that ever existed
[12:09:30] <doug16k> ad injectors wont run a thousand milliseconds after page load, after asynchronous module loading 4 things sequentially
[12:09:40] <simon> doug16k, I don't want document.write. but assuming I only have one <script src="foo"> to deal with, I suppose the alternative is finding that script tag and inserting stuff after it.
[12:10:11] <simon> doug16k, this is not for advertising. it's a bunch of interactive navigatable graphs made by students. :P
[12:12:14] <doug16k> remove that document.write, do a createElement('style') and set its innerHTML to that stuff it writes into it. append that to the head. done
[12:13:06] <simon> doug16k, that's it for the <style> tag, yes. but for the <div>s that need to go approximately where the original <script> tag was, I suppose I'll just have to search for the script tag and append after it.
[12:13:12] <snover> for goodness sake!
[12:13:15] <snover> stop!
[12:13:31] <doug16k> or, since it is jquery: $('<style/>', { html: content }).appendTo('head')
[12:13:41] <doug16k> where "content" is that style content
[12:13:42] <simon> snover, is it ill-conceived to insert stuff where a <script> tag is located?
[12:14:01] <simon> I understand what you are saying. I'm going to do that! but for the <div>s, I cannot add them to <head>...
[12:14:20] <doug16k> append them wherever you see fit
[12:14:31] <simon> right.
[12:14:48] <simon> I'll have my JS practices adjusted by tomorrow! :)
[12:15:07] <simon> I truly appreciate this.
[12:18:57] <draconusdesigns> :(
[12:19:00] <draconusdesigns> okay
[12:24:22] <simon> doug16k, and { html: styling } is just as good as { text: styling }?
[12:25:21] <draconusdesigns> I will start a fiddle.
[12:25:35] <draconusdesigns> I figure from there I can get some idea of the first clue how to proceed.
[12:25:43] <doug16k> simon, I expect text to escape it, which isn't what you want
[12:26:01] <draconusdesigns> the sortable list is easy enough. The hard part is the multiselect items being disabled and added to the list.
[12:26:04] <doug16k> html blindly sets the content unmodified
[12:28:05] <doug16k> simon, foo.html('.foo { content: "X" }'); does what it looks like it does. .text would set it to .foo { content: &quot;X&quot; }
[12:30:33] <simon> doug16k, right.
[12:32:53] <doug16k> < and & are guaranteed to be escaped by .text. not 100% sure how many other values get escaped
[12:34:08] <doug16k> &quot; is only strictly necessary in a double-quoted attribute value
[12:38:38] <doug16k> simon, use .text when you mean to set the text. this is one of the rare cases when you actually want .html
[12:43:49] <draconusdesigns> http://jsfiddle.net/mvhxkgpw/4/
[12:44:19] <draconusdesigns> There is my setup I am starting with.
[12:44:41] <draconusdesigns> The issue is the multiselect items being added to the list as they are selected from the multiselect.
[12:46:12] <draconusdesigns> https://jsfiddle.net/mvhxkgpw/6/     <- Sorry, that is the correct link
[12:46:22] <BillCriswell> I have a select \*#todothis/*a*/[id="todothis"][id$="this"][id^="todo"][id*="doth"][id~="todothis"]:not(#todothat):nth-child(1n) and I need the element after it
[12:47:27] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: lol
[12:47:35] <doug16k> BillCriswell, you're serious?
[12:47:43] <BillCriswell> I wish.
[12:47:47] <doug16k> lol
[12:47:59] <simon> haha
[12:48:02] <BillCriswell> Trying to make the most redundant selector I could think of cause I'm bored.
[12:48:14] <BillCriswell> without repeating myself TOO much
[12:48:44] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: well then, well done
[12:48:44] <sumyunseal> any1 here mess with base2
[12:49:02] <sumyunseal> i cant figure out which files to download
[12:49:25] <BillCriswell> I found it interesting #foo/**/bar does not work but #foobar/**/:first-child {} or whatever works just fine.
[12:49:37] <doug16k> someday I expect someone to paste that massive email validation script into a selector to only select valid email elements :)
[12:49:50] <doug16k> email validation regex I mean
[12:49:51] <sumyunseal> gawd
[12:49:56] <sumyunseal> can u gaize stop trolen
[12:50:57] <BillCriswell> Oh it'll happen.
[12:51:57] <BillCriswell> I don't know what those words mean.
[12:52:22] <sumyunseal> base 2
[12:52:26] <sumyunseal> comon ppl
[12:52:30] <sumyunseal> help the poor kid
[12:52:43] <robertBusy> huh?
[12:53:04] <sumyunseal> grrrr
[12:53:16] <robertBusy> looks like a jquery alternative?
[12:53:20] <sumyunseal> no
[12:53:41] <sumyunseal> im so beyond u gaize
[12:53:55] <sumyunseal> i will be the new leader here now
[12:54:04] <BillCriswell> sumyunseal: THANK YOU
[12:57:21] <simon> doug16k, jQuery selectors support regexes?
[12:57:46] <NoiseEee> what kind of selector requires a regex?
[12:58:18] <sumyunseal> select and regex doesnt go together
[12:59:10] <sumyunseal> actualy its probably just fine
[12:59:34] <sumyunseal> v8 i heard is almost as fast as C
[13:00:00] <sumyunseal> and jq already has = selector
[13:03:27] <robertBusy> simon there are some interesting options for contains/begins wish/ends with, etc.
[13:09:36] <game0> hi people, I'm new to jquery
[13:10:05] <arthurvr> Hi game0!
[13:10:12] <game0> I'm trying to send some parameters using jquery to application server but it's not working
[13:10:24] <game0> hi arthurvr
[13:10:31] <arthurvr> game0: what exactly isn’t working? Can you post us the code?
[13:11:25] <game0> OK, just wait
[13:12:07] <game0> http://pastebin.com/XbvUQSY7
[13:12:15] <game0> arthurvr
[13:12:23] <game0> OK, this is my code
[13:12:37] <game0> I want to send the name to an application server
[13:12:57] <game0> and the application will get the name and do it's action
[13:13:09] <arthurvr> well the settings you pass into jQuery.ajax seem wrong.
[13:13:24] <game0> how?
[13:13:43] <arthurvr>  type: frm.attr('text/html'), - what was your intention with that? doesn’t make sense.
[13:13:56] <arthurvr> type should be `post` or `get` or whatever http method
[13:14:30] <arthurvr> Also you’re using .attr(). The type has nothing to do with attributes of your tag.
[13:14:38] <game0> OK, thanks let me try it again
[13:15:09] <game0> how can I fix this?
[13:16:06] <game0> I just want to send the name to the link
[13:16:33] <game0> localhost:8080/hello?name={name}
[13:16:37] <game0> like that
[13:16:44] <game0> arthurvr
[13:17:15] <arthurvr> so you just want to submit the data you type into a form through ajax?
[13:17:38] <game0> yes
[13:17:48] <arthurvr> game0: let me fiddle a better example for you
[13:18:02] <game0> I wana test the application it self
[13:18:42] <game0> this group is great
[13:22:56] <arthurvr> game0: not exactly like your example but this is what you’re trying to do right? http://jsfiddle.net/fca5n9wv/1/
[13:24:04] <game0> OK arthurvr thanks, but can you tell me what wrong with attr?
[13:24:10] <game0> just for knowledge
[13:24:54] <arthurvr> game0: I think you’ve got the point of .attr() wrong. the attr method has nothing to do with attributes passed with the url. It’s about attributes of elements in your DOM.
[13:25:03] <arthurvr> `api attr @ game0
[13:25:03] <b-ot> game0: .attr(): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[13:25:57] <game0> OK, you mean that .name is the right one
[13:26:00] <game0> ?
[13:26:51] <arthurvr> game0: what do you mean with name? To get the value of an <input> you should use .val()
[13:27:05] <arthurvr> `api val @ game0
[13:27:05] <b-ot> game0: .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[13:28:54] <hlvwrk> Hey duders. So I'm trying to programmatically adjust the inputs that are able to be tabbed to... http://jsfiddle.net/qumgym1y/1/ How would I only allow tabbing (and shift tabbing) to inputs within the tabbable divs?
[13:28:59] <hlvwrk> o_O
[13:29:22] <game0> I will check the link, but I did make the changes and it didn't work
[13:29:22] <hlvwrk> shoky i know you'd be able to do that for me in like .5 seconds. :P
[13:29:36] <arthurvr> game0: you understand it now?
[13:29:39] <game0> but thanks I will review the link and see how it's behave
[13:30:04] <arthurvr> game0: Sure. api.jquery.com is the place to be.
[13:30:11] <arthurvr> game0: And of course, learn.jquery.com :-)
[13:30:25] <hlvwrk> arthurvr, got a sec when you're finished with him? ;o
[13:30:35] <game0> Yes, I hope that
[13:30:43] <game0> I wish that
[13:30:51] <arthurvr> hlvwrk: I’m here. Shoot. :-)
[13:30:55] <game0> thanks arthurvr, your so kind
[13:30:59] <hlvwrk> I'm trying to programmatically adjust the inputs that are able to be tabbed to... http://jsfiddle.net/qumgym1y/1/ How would I only allow tabbing (and shift tabbing) to inputs within the tabbable divs?
[13:31:34] <hlvwrk> basically have a homegrown dialog region that when a user tabs through the inputs on the dialog, is able to tab on the inputs behind it... which can't happen :x
[13:33:42] <arthurvr> hlvwrk: so if you tab into an <input> in the read area, it must just skip that one? I’ve got you right?
[13:34:18] <hlvwrk> well, the jsfiddle is just an example. basically the issue is that the red is behind a dialog mask, so you'll never be able to be focused to that in the app.
[13:34:25] <hlvwrk> the tabbable items are in the dialog region
[13:35:13] <hlvwrk> for sake of demonstrative purposes, the fiddle, imagine the red simply can't be focused. so if you tab the inputs, it only tabs between the inputs within inputs inside of the .tabbable div
[13:35:15] <hlvwrk> divs*
[13:35:26] <hlvwrk> kinda hard to explain, but i think that makes sense
[13:36:08] <arthurvr> hlvwrk: out of interest, why not to use `disabled`? Or isn’t that what you’re try to do?
[13:36:09] <arthurvr> as in http://jsfiddle.net/qumgym1y/2/
[13:36:25] <hlvwrk> becasue the items aren't actually disabled, they're overlayed by a dialog mask
[13:37:36] <arthurvr> hlvwrk: yes, but then disabled just does the trick right?
[13:38:41] <hlvwrk> i guess, but this isn't just one form that it needs to apply this logic to... so think of an application with 30 different dialogs... and only the inputs within the dialogs are able to be tabbed between.
[13:39:23] <hlvwrk> so making them disabled works if it were just one form, but that wouldn't really work in this case
[13:39:56] <arthurvr> Is the amount of dialogs a problem then? You can still insert the disabled attr programagically.
[13:41:02] <arthurvr> Doing the check for keyCode on like 30 forms is more likely going to be a performance problem.
[13:41:09] <hlvwrk> it's kinda hard to explain why that wouldn't work, but it wouldn't. some of these forms can't be disabled, but they simply can't be tabbed through
[13:41:48] <hlvwrk> it's a large application, not a regular website... so ignore the performance issue, this is a workaround for the interim
[13:43:08] <arthurvr> hlvwrk: it being a large site should mean you have to worry even more
[13:43:09] <arthurvr> perfmatters
[13:43:35] <hlvwrk> not when the dialog region is being destroyed on close.
[13:44:05] <hlvwrk> and this code only runs when the dialog is shown.
[13:46:00] <shoky> hlvwrk: http://jsfiddle.net/qumgym1y/4/  i guess
[13:46:36] <doug16k> simon, well they arent really regexes, but css attribute selectors can do begins with, contains, and ends with matches, that are vaguely similar to real regexes. no they dont support full blown regex syntax.
[13:47:04] <hlvwrk> shoky, I'm gunna toy with this. It's pretty close to what I need. Thanks homie. <3
[13:47:20] <shoky> werd
[13:48:00] <hlvwrk> can you expand on the find input to also look buttons?
[13:48:17] <hlvwrk> would it just be;.find('input, button');
[13:49:48] <shoky> hlvwrk ya and also needed for the selector in the 1st line
[13:50:38] <hlvwrk> $('.form').on('keydown', '.TABBABLE input, .TABBABLE button', function (e) { ?
[13:50:42] <hlvwrk> that easy?
[13:50:43] <hlvwrk> lol
[13:50:52] <hlvwrk> you're amazing btw. Thank you so much for your help on this.
[13:51:54] <shoky> ;]
[14:25:21] <iarp> Just curious if anyone has any suggestions on making this simplier and faster. I have hundreds of rows in a table i'm trying to sum up at the end of each row. What i've pasted here is just a small example http://pastebin.com/n28Edbrp
[14:26:12] <iarp> It updates the sum every second, which is great but the page runs quite slow as i figured would happen with so much happening at once (maybe?)
[14:26:15] <robertMeeting> what's wuth the setinterval?
[14:26:25] <robertMeeting> why not update when the values update?
[14:27:43] <game0> arthurvr
[14:27:44] <game0> http://pastebin.com/DisH0Kjb
[14:27:56] <game0> I have tried this code and it's not working
[14:29:10] <iarp> robertMeeting: setinterval was just to get the update_total to run every second. I'm not entirely sure how or what i would do to make it work based off values updating
[14:29:27] <robertMeeting> $('input').on('change', function() {});
[14:29:32] <robertMeeting> or the input event.
[14:30:36] <Wingate> Hi!
[14:31:07] <Wingate> I have a problem to concatenate a variable within a string like this: $(".content-expand").load("inc/contents-expand.html $itemID");
[14:31:29] <Wingate> The value of $itemID comme from here: var $itemID = "#"+this.id;
[14:31:43] <hlvwrk> shoky worked perfectly. thanks again
[14:31:56] <tlkr> Wingate, (".content-expand").load("inc/contents-expand.html"+$itemID);
[14:32:03] <Wingate> Please can somebody help me to fix that?
[14:32:17] <robertMeeting> Wingate tlkr just did ;)
[14:32:51] <Wingate> Hm thank tlkr, let me try
[14:33:17] <kevireilly> Odd, I'm seeing what appears to suggest that a el.data('attribute') call was returning a cached attribute value while el.attr('data-attribute') is returning an updated value. Any ideas what the explanation or reasoning here might be?
[14:33:31] <iarp> robertMeeting: That would trigger for that single input being updated, what would i do to count up the other inputs for the same player_id
[14:33:54] <robertMeeting> kevireilly exactly that.  .data() expects that you're using it for setting/getting.  .attr() expects that you use it.
[14:34:08] <Wingate> Wow thanks tlkr! :D
[14:34:08] <robertMeeting> iarp select all of them and add them up.
[14:34:15] <tlkr> no problem Wingate
[14:34:17] <robertMeeting> iarp setup a fiddle if you need more help.
[14:35:22] <kevireilly> robertMeeting: I'm not sure I understand, shouldn't both return the present value and both allow you to set the attribute?
[14:35:43] <robertMeeting> kevireilly .data() accesses a cached version.
[14:35:49] <robertMeeting> which makes it faster.
[14:36:00] <kevireilly> ah, so if it changes after a previous get, it returns the previous value
[14:36:07] <kevireilly> interesting and good to know
[14:36:24] <robertMeeting> so if you set via .attr() and try to get using .data(), you'll have headaches.
[14:36:57] <robertMeeting> and vice versa.
[14:37:17] <game0> can anyone offer me help here, just need someone to check my code and tell why it's not sending the request
[14:37:21] <game0> http://pastebin.com/DisH0Kjb
[14:37:38] <robertMeeting> need a document ready, game0
[14:37:46] <kevireilly> robertMeeting: aha! that is surely the problem then, I think the implementation of someone else uses a mix. So, using data always should have made it work properly
[14:37:58] <robertMeeting> kevireilly yep yep.
[14:38:04] <kevireilly> thanks robertMeeting, much appreciated
[14:38:12] <robertMeeting> fsho.
[14:39:04] <game0> what do you mean?
[14:39:16] <robertMeeting> your code is running before the form exists.
[14:39:23] <robertMeeting> !api document ready
[14:39:44] <robertMeeting> awww bad bot - http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/ check this out.
[14:39:56] <game0> can you please make the changes and tell me
[14:40:25] <robertMeeting> did you try reading the document first?
[14:40:52] <game0> I wana test some application only
[14:41:03] <robertMeeting> lol
[14:41:11] <robertMeeting> http://fixee.org/paste/pb754oh/
[14:41:15] <robertMeeting> documet ready.
[14:41:44] <robertMeeting> *document
[14:41:56] <game0> thanks, I will try it
[14:42:13] <wolfram7_> so I've made a moderately complicated svg on my page procedurally, is it possible to like, save that or pass it on as an argument to elsewhere?
[14:42:23] <iarp> robertMeeting: http://jsfiddle.net/d0se80kk/ like that?
[14:42:51] <robertMeeting> iarp no.
[14:42:59] <robertMeeting> don't use setInterval in this case.  you dpn't need it.
[14:43:52] <robertMeeting> use .on() and update every time a value changes.
[14:44:14] <iarp> Yes but without the type and id, how would i know which ones to read from
[14:44:24] <robertMeeting> do it from all of them.
[14:44:37] <iarp> ah
[14:44:37] <robertMeeting> you're trying to view the value of all of them added up, right?
[14:44:55] <iarp> I'm trying to update the total at the end of each row
[14:45:04] <iarp> summing up the values in the input boxes for that row
[14:45:19] <robertMeeting> yeah, use http://api.jquery.com/map/ and then the array reduce in native JS.
[14:45:44] <game0> robertMeeting, sorry it's not working
[14:45:51] <game0> I don't know why?
[14:45:59] <robertMeeting> game0 open your console - is that clean?
[14:47:27] <game0> OK, there is something missing it said, some bracket I will check it
[14:51:09] <robertMeeting> iarp http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d0se80kk/3/ something like this.
[14:53:40] <iarp> robertMeeting: oh wow, thanks, i was working on something much more uglier
[14:54:13] <iarp> i was thinking of adding a custom attribute to the rows and then using that..etc.
[14:54:19] <robertMeeting> hell no hahahaha
[14:57:47] <kevireilly> robertMeeting: quick clarification, like `attr`, does `data` actually update the attribute of the element?
[14:57:54] <robertMeeting> no.
[14:57:59] <kevireilly> interesting
[14:58:05] <robertMeeting> because the DOM is slow.
[14:58:06] <robertMeeting> basically.
[14:59:16] <kevireilly> but as long as you're exclusively using `data`, it doesn't matter because it isn't like a mutated attribute needs to be persisted
[14:59:24] <robertMeeting> exactly.
[15:01:42] <kevireilly> gracias roberto
[15:01:48] <robertMeeting> si senor.
[15:03:30] <iarp> robertMeeting: Aside from the span now having class="total" was anything else changed? Nothing catches my eye and i'm greeted with "Reduce of empty array with no inital value" error
[15:06:12] <robertMeeting> wut
[15:06:17] <robertMeeting> just the JS.
[15:07:17] <iarp> hmm ok, i'm reading online that an array cannot be reduced when its empty, i'm guessing it would be empty if a row has no values in any of the boxes
[15:10:44] <iarp> i got it, thanks. i just check the lenght of valueArray before trying to update the total
[15:27:19] <WhitePaperXZ> Hello
[16:01:13] <wolfram7_> anybody about?
[16:02:46] <tandroid> maybe
[16:03:03] <wolfram7_> I generate a neat svg file procedurally on my website
[16:03:23] <wolfram7_> I was wondering how hard it is to save it and pass it on to another site as like, the input for a t-shirt or some such
[16:05:19] <doug16k> wolfram7_, why not just get the .prop('outerHTML') and grab the entire content of the element
[16:07:20] <doug16k> or innerHTML
[16:07:36] <doug16k> as long as you reconstruct it the same
[16:11:32] <doug16k> wolfram7_, right click the element in the browser's element debugger and click edit outer html. copy whole thing
[16:11:58] <doug16k> you see lots of stuff in there right?
[16:12:12] <wolfram7_> well, using the jquery call "$("parent").children("svg")" I get the object I'm interested in
[16:13:01] <doug16k> can you console.log("$("parent").children("svg").prop("innerHTML")) and see if it prints lots of stuff to the debugger console?
[16:13:34] <doug16k> how many svg's are there?
[16:13:40] <doug16k> one, right?
[16:13:52] <wolfram7_> just one, with about 20~ elements
[16:14:09] <doug16k> ok then the console.log should work fine
[16:14:44] <wolfram7_> huh, I seem to have a lot of blank lines
[16:15:07] <doug16k> do you have a fiddle or site that shows your scenario?
[16:16:26] <wolfram7_> https://safe-river-2636.herokuapp.com/t
[16:16:29] <wolfram7_> https://safe-river-2636.herokuapp.com/
[16:16:30] <wolfram7_> oops
[16:17:41] <doug16k> wolfram7_, ok, open that page. press f12, click console at the top
[16:17:49] <doug16k> in the console type: $('svg')
[16:17:55] <doug16k> expand the thing it shows
[16:18:03] <wolfram7_> yeah, i have that
[16:18:05] <doug16k> it's all there in the html
[16:18:25] <wolfram7_> yeah, and I guess i'm wondering how hard is it to pass that on to somewhere else
[16:18:26] <wolfram7_> or save it
[16:18:41] <wolfram7_> like, maybe shutterfly? http://www.shutterfly.com/photo-gifts/plates
[16:18:59] <wolfram7_> never been much for chotchkes
[16:28:52] <doug16k> I suppose you could serialize the svg to a data url and make a link that "downloads" it from it
[16:29:58] <doug16k> as in, a click handler on an <a> anchor element that sets the href to a data url that represents the svg element html
[16:30:50] <doug16k> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/data_URIs
[16:32:20] <doug16k> let me see if it works
[16:33:28] <dfoolz> Hi. Anyone familiar with animations that has a minute to spare for a quick question? Thanks.
[16:33:36] <superjacaman_> hey
[16:33:37] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ dfoolz
[16:33:37] <b-ot> dfoolz: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:33:45] <dfoolz> Thanks :p
[16:34:14] <dfoolz> so, http://gyazo.com/504e8d856c540e74bcfaa29b26a34faf
[16:34:43] <dfoolz> I want it to slide like that, but push the element to the right of it instead of automatically displaying the width of the new element.
[16:34:51] <dfoolz> I have .show('slide', {direction: 'left'}, 1000); currently. Any ideas?
[16:34:54] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ dfoolz
[16:34:55] <b-ot> dfoolz: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:35:01] <robertmaxrees> give us a working test case :)
[16:35:01] <dfoolz> Sorry!
[16:35:07] <robertmaxrees> it's alright :D
[16:41:37] <TeddyMurray> what's the difference between return false; and preventDefault for submit forms?
[16:42:06] <robertmaxrees> the jquery event handling system sees return false; and runs preventDefault and stopPropagation() against the event object iirc.
[16:45:49] <dfoolz> nvm I figured it out. I just needed to set the div width to 0 and animate it out from there :)
[16:46:01] <vinex08> hi, i need guide/help on this.... i creating a mobile menu -- here's the code : http://jsfiddle.net/97tw5gw1/4/   and here's what i want to do -- http://prntscr.com/67d0tw
[16:46:51] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having trouble with a selector after it's been injected via .html(). Consider the following: http://jsfiddle.net/2s62ubv5/ I wan't to trigger #test in that example (super simplified version of what I'm working on)
[16:48:05] <robertmaxrees> dfoolz boom.  well done :)
[16:48:20] <dfoolz> checkit, you need to intialize the click event inside of the first on click.
[16:48:30] <robertmaxrees> noooo
[16:48:33] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[16:48:40] <dfoolz> okay
[16:48:42] * dfoolz hushes
[16:48:43] <dfoolz> lol
[16:48:46] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:48:53] <checkit> robertmaxrees: That's what I'm looking for.
[16:49:06] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2s62ubv5/1/
[16:49:12] <robertmaxrees> bind further down than document if you can.
[16:50:37] <checkit> Awesome dude. Thanks again.
[16:50:54] <robertmaxrees> fsho.  http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events read this when you have a few.
[16:50:55] <dismist> atta boy robert
[16:52:37] <dfoolz> thank you robertmaxrees
[16:53:03] <dfoolz> teaching me how to jquery properly <3
[16:55:55] <robertmaxrees> fshosho
[16:57:25] <dandaman> can anyone help me try to understand what's going on in the curvedLine function here? http://curved_lines.overfx.net/download/jquery.curved.line-0.0.2.js I don't quite understand what $.fn.extend is or how this function is declared :\
[16:57:35] <dandaman> expecially the return statement which appears to be a loop :\
[16:58:36] <printForever> need a simple jQuery question answered
[16:58:55] <printForever> how can I declare global var?
[16:59:04] <robertmaxrees> printForever that's a javascript question.
[16:59:04] <printForever> I have multiple scripts
[16:59:10] <robertmaxrees> dandaman that's basically extending the "fn" property, which is where you put methods.
[16:59:16] <printForever> well... its a beginners question
[16:59:25] <robertmaxrees> dandaman .on(), .toggle(), etc are all in $.fn
[16:59:34] <printForever> I know
[16:59:36] <robertmaxrees> printForever do window.yourNameHere.
[16:59:53] <robertmaxrees> and then access it explicitly through the window obkect.
[16:59:55] <robertmaxrees> *object.
[17:00:01] <dandaman> robertmaxrees: so essentially you're creating a jquery method?
[17:00:21] <robertmaxrees> dandaman that's what that's doing, yes
[17:00:28] <printForever> Explanation. I want to declare var which would contain image path. And I have multiple jQuery SCRIPTS where I would like to include that var. They are all separate scripts.
[17:00:49] <robertmaxrees> dandaman that return is returning an object of "everything" - check out the jquery docs on writing plugins.
[17:00:59] <robertmaxrees> printForever then yeah, window.varNameHere.
[17:01:23] <printForever> robertmaxrees, can I get some tutorial link or something? because #confused
[17:01:31] <robertmaxrees> printForever what are you confused about?
[17:01:38] <printForever> how do I...
[17:01:40] <printForever> do that
[17:01:44] <robertmaxrees> that will attach the variable to the window object, which is global.
[17:01:49] <robertmaxrees> window.varNameHere = 'anything';
[17:01:55] <robertmaxrees> use it like any other variable.
[17:01:57] <printForever> aaaaaaaaaa
[17:02:04] <printForever> got it
[17:02:13] <dismist> hey robert.... how many hours in head and heartache do you think youve saved the patrons of this channel today?
[17:02:23] <printForever> so just add window.ImagePath = 'img/print.jpg';
[17:02:23] <robertmaxrees> probably not many hahahaha
[17:02:27] <robertmaxrees> printForever yep.
[17:02:35] <printForever> saved me 15 minutes
[17:03:08] <printForever> robertmaxrees, do I write it inside jQuery function?
[17:03:18] <robertmaxrees> "jQuery function"?  no.
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> don't even know what that is.
[17:03:26] <printForever> epiclly confused
[17:03:40] <printForever> $('').attr(''....
[17:03:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:03:45] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:03:49] <printForever> ok... so...
[17:03:53] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other variable.
[17:04:07] <printForever> :/
[17:04:16] <robertmaxrees> you just have to make sure you put that before any other code.
[17:04:21] <printForever> ok
[17:04:48] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4Lkppgjm/
[17:04:50] <robertmaxrees> no jquery needed.
[17:07:20] <printForever> this is what I'm thinking about
[17:07:20] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/4Lkppgjm/1/
[17:07:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:07:46] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to then use window.someVar?
[17:07:57] <printForever> I want to declare VAR and use it to fill in the DIV
[17:08:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4Lkppgjm/2/
[17:08:13] <printForever> aaaaaaaaaaaa
[17:08:15] <printForever> .text
[17:08:21] <printForever> Fin A
[17:08:23] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:08:27] <printForever> tnx!
[17:08:29] <robertmaxrees> you could use html.
[17:08:36] <robertmaxrees> but the real problem was the quotes.
[17:08:40] <printForever> text is only for text
[17:08:44] <printForever> html is for tags too
[17:08:50] <printForever> I need just text
[17:08:53] <printForever> thanks!
[17:08:58] <robertmaxrees> ... right, but the issue was you were using 'someVar' - you needed it without the quotes.
[17:09:00] <printForever> you've explained this to me :D
[17:09:03] <robertmaxrees> also, use window.someVar instead.
[17:09:10] <printForever> btw. I had no idea what I was doing
[17:09:16] <printForever> I just wrote what I felt was semi-good
[17:09:23] <printForever> first time ever using vars
[17:09:32] * printForever facepalm
[17:09:55] <robertmaxrees> you've used objects before.
[17:10:02] <printForever> nope
[17:10:05] <printForever> :/
[17:10:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:10:12] <printForever> I mean, objects like...
[17:10:15] <printForever> .class
[17:10:16] <robertmaxrees> everything in jS is an object.
[17:10:20] <printForever> right
[17:10:20] <robertmaxrees> $() is an example.
[17:10:37] <printForever> I dont have... what you would call... a standard education in jQuery
[17:10:48] <robertmaxrees> this isn't jquery though,.
[17:10:51] <robertmaxrees> it's just javascript.
[17:11:00] <printForever> well... I suck at multiple things
[17:11:14] <printForever> however, I'm learning
[17:11:30] <printForever> I just had an idea
[17:11:42] <printForever> can I write jQuery code that will fill in the var
[17:11:57] <robertmaxrees> what is "jquery code"?
[17:11:59] <printForever> and then use it in .text
[17:12:01] <printForever> um...
[17:12:25] <robertmaxrees> you can set that var, sure.
[17:12:26] <printForever> $('.name').contents() when I get the content of .name I want to put it in VAR
[17:12:40] <printForever> and then later use that VAR
[17:13:10] <robertmaxrees> var $foo = $('.name').contents();
[17:13:36] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/4Lkppgjm/3/
[17:13:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:13:49] <printForever> thats my idea :D
[17:13:49] <robertmaxrees> $('#fiddi').conent.appendTo('someVar'); isn't anything.
[17:13:54] <printForever> I know
[17:14:05] <robertmaxrees> ... what are you indending that to do?
[17:14:07] <robertmaxrees> *intending
[17:14:15] <robertmaxrees> this is all backwards.
[17:14:16] <printForever> basically what you wrote
[17:14:18] <printForever> :))))
[17:14:23] <printForever> for me its the other way around
[17:14:30] <printForever> I'm not thinking like a programmer
[17:14:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm totally lost.
[17:14:45] <printForever> I wanted to get the content from #fiddi
[17:14:49] <printForever> and put it in a VAR
[17:14:54] <robertmaxrees> you want the text or the html?
[17:14:59] <printForever> text
[17:15:03] <robertmaxrees> .text9)
[17:15:06] <robertmaxrees> *.text()
[17:15:14] <printForever> right
[17:15:27] <robertmaxrees> you use that to get and set text in nodes.
[17:15:31] <printForever> and put that text in window.someVar
[17:15:59] <robertmaxrees> window.someVar = $('#thing').text();
[17:16:06] <printForever> ooooooohhhhhh
[17:16:09] <printForever> so simple
[17:16:10] <printForever> so easy
[17:16:11] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ you need to start here.
[17:16:20] <kostasx> printForever: http://jsfiddle.net/4Lkppgjm/4/
[17:16:36] <printForever> my problem is that I know different parts of JS and jQuery
[17:16:43] <robertmaxrees> kostasx we already wen over that ;)
[17:16:49] <printForever> I'm missing basics, but I know how to use it and edit
[17:17:00] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/tXcUX/2/      ----   i want the li to have a separate link.. not just toggle feature. how can i do that?
[17:17:01] <printForever> window.someVar = $('#thing').text(); this is perfect
[17:17:14] <robertmaxrees> printForever right, so go through the learning center and get those basics.
[17:17:40] <printForever> :) I will and I thank you for the patience!
[17:17:42] <vinex08> http://prntscr.com/67dcbu
[17:17:51] <kostasx> printForever: I would suggest you first learn the basics of JavaScript.
[17:18:56] <printForever> I suck at learning the regular way
[17:19:03] <printForever> until I have a question or a problem...
[17:19:09] <printForever> it just goes over my head
[17:19:32] <printForever> one more thing
[17:19:43] <printForever> any time I wish to output the var
[17:19:48] <printForever> I should not use quotes
[17:20:40] <printForever> for example if I the VAR is HEX color or some other CSS property or if I'm adding a class name from VAR to a div
[17:20:53] <kostasx> printForever variable names are never enclosed in quotes (except when being object properties)
[17:21:05] <printForever> got it
[17:21:08] <kostasx> I think you're confusing variable names and its values
[17:21:14] <printForever> yup
[17:22:56] <kostasx> you must be aware of the value type a variable holds. That's why I'm  saying you should start from the JavaScript basics.
[17:23:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:23:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:23:17] <robertmaxrees> it's much more important than you think.
[17:26:45] <reynierpm> hi there, can I get some advice with this topic http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28620118/function-displayopenxads-is-not-defined ??
[17:27:47] <vinex08> ok i think i got it now,, the only problem is... that sign doesnt go back to + sign
[17:27:49] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/tXcUX/4/
[17:28:26] <vinex08> so - (for expanded submenu)   and +  (for closed submenu)
[17:29:42] <printForever> robertmaxrees, kostasx, I have a valid jQuery question, how do I get Job_title from this div http://jsfiddle.net/k0qnmqks/
[17:29:48] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm define that function before the document ready.
[17:30:00] <printForever> .text() would return Name SurnameJob_title
[17:30:15] <printForever> .html() would return <b>Name Surname</b>Job_title
[17:32:49] <printForever> is there some filter I could apply?
[17:33:13] <printForever> something like .text().filter()
[17:43:12] <kostasx> printForever: a dirty of way of doing this: http://jsfiddle.net/k0qnmqks/2/
[17:43:34] <printForever> ouh...
[17:43:43] <printForever> I was researching the problem
[17:43:52] <printForever> I tried using .html().not(b)
[17:43:57] <printForever> but it throws an error
[17:44:05] <kostasx> not("b") ?
[17:44:15] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/k0qnmqks/2/
[17:44:35] <printForever> I mean...
[17:45:02] <printForever> my logic. GET HTML from .name but NOT from B tag
[17:45:16] <printForever> thats why I wrote .html().not(b)
[17:45:52] <printForever> window.getJobTitle = $('.name').html().not(b);
[17:46:48] <robertmaxrees> printForever you need to learn about types.
[17:48:02] <printForever> I tried putting .not('b'); - because its a tag not a VAR - but I got the same error
[17:48:13] <robertmaxrees> $(".name").html() returns a string.
[17:48:19] <robertmaxrees> .not() expects a jquery object.
[17:48:30] <printForever> ouh...
[17:48:42] <printForever> so I should use filter()
[17:48:44] <kostasx> http://jsfiddle.net/k0qnmqks/4/
[17:48:45] <printForever> because it works with strings
[17:49:04] <robertmaxrees> do you want just the text of the element?
[17:49:11] <printForever> yes
[17:49:31] <vinex08> hello
[17:49:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k0qnmqks/6/ printForever
[17:49:37] <vinex08> anyone there?
[17:50:10] <robertmaxrees> even simpler, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k0qnmqks/7/
[17:50:11] <printForever> robertmaxrees, but I dont want the 'Name Surname' part
[17:50:14] <printForever> thats the problem
[17:50:22] <robertmaxrees> you want the text that's NOT in the <b> tag?
[17:50:25] <printForever> yes
[17:50:35] <robertmaxrees> then kostasx'x solution is the right one.
[17:50:44] <robertmaxrees> there are alternatives, but that works.
[17:50:47] <printForever> but is my idea valid?
[17:50:55] <printForever> to use filter()
[17:50:56] <robertmaxrees> that's not a very good way to structure markup.
[17:51:00] <robertmaxrees> vinex08 we're here.
[17:51:04] <printForever> not my markup :(
[17:51:15] <vinex08> ohhh i thought no one sees my chat :)
[17:51:17] <printForever> sorry vinex08, I took their time :(
[17:51:32] <vinex08> no prob.. just making sure am not muted or watever
[17:51:33] <kostasx> printForever: And a 3rd one: http://jsfiddle.net/k0qnmqks/8/
[17:51:50] <robertmaxrees> don't ever use regex for this fwiw
[17:52:04] <printForever> thank you kostasx
[17:52:43] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you another way.
[17:52:50] <printForever> with filter?! :)
[17:52:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:52:55] <printForever> or :not
[17:53:00] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:53:02] <printForever> ok...
[17:53:19] <kostasx> hmmmm…. let's see
[17:53:24] <robertmaxrees> one sec :)
[17:53:27] <kostasx> sure
[17:53:35] <kostasx> drums rolling...
[17:53:46] <printForever> I will get the cakes!
[17:54:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k0qnmqks/9/
[17:54:12] <robertmaxrees> roundabout, but doesn't rely on the order of things in the DOM as much.
[17:54:21] <printForever> http://imgur.com/gallery/xth1XK2
[17:55:07] <kostasx> There's more than one way to skin the DOM...
[17:55:14] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:55:22] <robertmaxrees> in this case, fixing the document structure would be preferred.
[17:55:27] <robertmaxrees> but since that's not doable...
[17:56:08] <kostasx> another satisfied jQuery customer served :)
[17:56:18] <printForever> ok, so... for my vanity
[17:56:23] <printForever> is .filter usable here?
[17:56:27] <printForever> or .not or :not
[17:56:32] <kostasx> If only we had a dollar for each $() we used...
[17:56:36] <printForever> are any of them applicable
[17:57:26] <robertmaxrees> printForever do you know what any of those do?
[17:57:48] <printForever> .filter is used for filtering out results from an array (I guess)
[17:58:03] <robertmaxrees> in jquery, you'd use .filter() to reduce the set of matched elements down.
[17:58:07] <printForever> .not is for excluding results from the returned ... thing
[17:58:11] <robertmaxrees> you could munge it, but it's not really what you want.
[17:58:25] <printForever> :not is used inside the selector
[17:58:40] <robertmaxrees> .not() and :not() give you elements that aren't something else - you needed the text, not an element.
[17:58:55] <printForever> ouh...
[17:59:02] <printForever> got it
[17:59:23] <robertmaxrees> technically the text IS an element, but it's not the kind you want.
[18:04:26] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I get this SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[18:04:31] <printForever> when I try running your code
[18:04:43] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle?
[18:04:52] <printForever> no, in my JS
[18:04:54] <printForever> file
[18:04:59] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've got then.
[18:05:49] <TeddyMurray> if i have a jquery script loaded into a div using $.get -- how do i get the javascript errors to propogate to the console?
[18:05:58] <TeddyMurray> it always refers to the $.html() im using
[18:06:00] <robertmaxrees> TeddyMurray they just do.
[18:06:16] <robertmaxrees> check out the stack trace and see if that helps.
[18:06:27] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/k0qnmqks/12/
[18:06:40] <TeddyMurray> i did, it refers to line 24 which is a $.get and then a $.html
[18:06:47] <TeddyMurray> but the real error is within the loaded page
[18:06:54] <robertmaxrees> printForever... you can't do that.
[18:07:00] <printForever> ah crap
[18:07:04] <printForever> :(
[18:07:05] <robertmaxrees> printForever you can't just use , anywhere.
[18:07:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k0qnmqks/13/
[18:08:27] <robertmaxrees> even better: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k0qnmqks/14/
[18:08:29] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i leave.
[18:08:31] <robertmaxrees> enjoy
[18:08:50] <printForever> this is everything
[18:08:53] <printForever> I needed to learn
[18:08:59] <printForever> about getting content out of the page
[18:09:01] <printForever> thank you!
[18:09:08] <printForever> I learned how to use vars
[18:09:11] <printForever> global vars
[18:09:19] <printForever> and how to automatically assign them
[18:09:21] <printForever> man!
[18:09:27] <printForever> I learned in 1 hour
[18:09:32] <printForever> more than...
[18:09:41] <printForever> well... I learned a lot
[18:09:50] <printForever> thank you! robert!
[18:11:12] <teza19> Hi guys, I'm trying to find a  more efficient way of executing my jquery (http://jsfiddle.net/mo3dynr4/). If you hover over the box, some text should appear. I have not yet added the feature for the yellow (or more) boxes yet, as I wanted to ask this first. How can I make it so that no matter how many 'colours' I add, the JQuery will have limited changes?
[18:11:52] <doug16k> TeddyMurray, you can attach a fail handler with .fail(function(xhr) { console.log('failed with status ' + xhr.status); });
[18:14:04] <doug16k> TeddyMurray, example: $.get('/foo', { id: id }).done(function(response) { console.log('good: ' + response)... followed by fail handler above
[18:14:46] <doug16k> which works before or after it is finished, meaning always
[18:15:13] <doug16k> ...works
[18:16:22] <doug16k> you can store or pass around and return the return value of those ajax functions
[18:16:33] <doug16k> you can attach 0 or more success or failure handlers
[18:17:01] <doug16k> attaching one after it is finished results in immediate call of your callback
[18:17:11] <doug16k> if appropriate
[18:17:38] <doug16k> after it succeeds, you can attach failure handlers all day and no effect
[18:17:43] <doug16k> and vice versa
[18:18:16] <doug16k> (after it fails you can attach success handlers all day and no effect)
[18:18:58] <doug16k> so in code you can return the $.ajax or helper value itself and the caller can make their code async use the result
[18:20:11] <doug16k> if you want to abstract it, use your own new Deferred and return that, attach your own filtering functions that resolve or reject your deferred with the abstracted format
[18:21:43] <doug16k> by attaching a .done handler to the actual ajax request object, and in that handler resolve your Deferred with the abstracted format
[18:22:02] <teza19> Anyone?
[18:24:58] <TeddyMurray> hey doug16k thanks im reading now sorry i was away
[18:27:07] <doug16k> TeddyMurray, you were asking about async ajax requests right?
[18:27:59] <TeddyMurray> yes, i think that solves my problem
[18:28:01] <TeddyMurray> i will try it
[18:28:35] <doug16k> oh I was talking about this that you said: if i have a jquery script loaded into a div using $.get -- how do i get the javascript errors to propogate to the console?
[18:29:30] <TeddyMurray> maybe i should take a screenshot
[18:29:37] <TeddyMurray> having dinner, one moment
[18:34:58] <TeddyMurray> okay, where should i upload jquery related screenshots?
[18:51:24] <symfonius> hello
[18:51:32] <symfonius> I am using the popover js library in bootstrap
[18:51:38] <symfonius> but I can't update the text in the popover
[18:51:45] <symfonius> has anyone had experience with this?
[18:51:59] <symfonius>  var popover = $('#approval').attr('data-content',data).data('bs.popover'); popover.setContent('test'); popover.$tip.addClass(popover.options.placement);
[18:52:18] <symfonius> i followed http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13564782/bootstrap-popover-content-cannot-changed-dynamically
[18:52:21] <symfonius> but its a few years old
[18:52:25] <symfonius> i suspect it may be out of date
[19:13:43] <TeddyMurray> im having strange behavior when i do $.tabs() on the same element twice in jquery ui
[19:25:44] <TeddyMurray> had to do this: $("#interviews_tabs").tabs('destroy');
[19:39:38] <doug16k> TeddyMurray, why do you initialize the same one twice?
[19:40:17] <doug16k> although a proper implementation would silently allow double init, that should be fixable on your end anyway
[19:40:43] <doug16k> do they use the same options?
[19:47:28] <TeddyMurray> yes, its in a function called display() which is called multiple times
[19:47:39] <TeddyMurray> so i made it if its not the initial load, tabs destroy then recreate
[19:47:42] <TeddyMurray> its a hack i guess
[21:55:49] <phlix> Anyone know how I can use animate to transition a background gradient?
[23:17:09] <Cork> phlix: gradients is seen as an image by the browser, so you can't transition it in the same element
[23:17:33] <Cork> i think there is css propositions for solving this, but i might remember wrong
