[00:00:55] <TimTim`> setting default position to relative also ensures position absolute works the way i want it to 99.9999% of the time
[00:01:36] <rgr> that sounds a bit ott but if it lights your fire.
[00:02:27] <TimTim`> i.e., the parent element of an absolute positioned element has to be position:relative|absolute for the absolute positioned element's top/left to match the top/left of its parent
[00:03:15] <TimTim`> and if for some reason you're ever positioning an element absolutely where you don't want it to be relative to its parent, you're doing something wrong :P
[00:04:23] <coldhead> in conclusion, z-indexes are a nightmare and it's a wonder anything ever works and let's just use flash
[00:05:18] <TimTim`> lol i hope you're joking coldhead O:)
[00:10:00] <seutje> coldhead: doesn't joke when it comes to z-indexes
[00:11:38] * coldhead np: engine kid - ¡Olé!
[00:49:19] <eregi> Hi! Can anyone please help my? I'm trying to achieveHi! Can anyone please help my? I'm trying to achieve
[00:50:20] <eregi> that the #riderInfo changes it's size accordingly to it's new contents, but somehow it's buggy. http://jsfiddle.net/K2DgQ/16/
[00:55:28] <coldhead> eregi: http://jsfiddle.net/K2DgQ/17/
[00:57:47] <eregi> coldhead, the change in size should be fluent, like slide up / down depending on the changes of height..
[00:58:08] <lolmaus> I'm running a CMS. What is the simpliest way to determine whether it loads jQuery?
[00:59:25] <seutje> eregi: the padding is fucking with you
[00:59:53] <coldhead> ?outerheight
[00:59:56] <bot-t> .outerHeight([includeMargin]): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[01:00:02] <coldhead> eregi: ^^
[01:00:09] <eregi> sutje, i tried adding the padding manually, and it fixed the problem a bit, but the sliding element jumped up and down anyways..
[01:00:30] <seutje> lolmaus: open the console and go "jQuery.fn.jquery"
[01:00:35] <seutje> it'll tell u the version
[01:01:00] <seutje> eregi: when you animate shit with a padding, the padding doesn't animate and gets added at the end iirc
[01:01:17] <seutje> use a wrapper or box-sizing
[01:01:40] <eregi> sutje, ok Probably that's what I was looking for :) thank you will try to test it
[01:02:14] <coldhead> so if you simply remove the padding? voila!
[01:02:19] <coldhead> ?cc
[01:02:20] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[01:05:47] <eregi> But why the 'bottom div' isn't slowly pushed down when the #riderInfo slidesDown?
[01:07:27] <Koopz> ever worked with keyup? sometimes my jquery didn't recognize the CTRL-Key and my hotkeys are working without holding CTRL...
[01:11:50] <Koopz> maybe its my jquery version... maybe that code snippet is a bad piece of code.. http://snipplr.com/view/20231/ unfortunately I don't know how to reproduce that problem... maybe i should set that variable to false after the shortcut has been executed...
[01:17:38] <Koopz> oh well what a bad idea...now i can only use one shortcut and need to release the CTRL-key in order to use a shortcut again...
[01:19:41] <eregi> coldhead, you here? Can't recreate the bug on my jsfiddle. The animation just pups up and then down..
[01:20:49] <greek> Hi fellas, jquery UI question on sortables that have been connected to a draggable. My sortreceive event isn't firing. However every other events works just fine (ie: sortchange, sortstop, etc). Any idea off the top of our heads what could cause this? I'll set up a jsfiddle if need be.
[01:21:18] <greek> I'm binding multiple sortables to a single draggable by using classes for the sortables
[01:21:41] <greek> When I just had one sortable, and used an ID for its selector, the sortreceive event worked just fine
[01:22:07] <greek> But now that I have multiple sortables and am using classes to connect them, all the events still work except for sortreceive
[01:22:12] <greek> Haven't changed the code
[01:22:58] <greek> I'm referring to this event: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#event-receive
[01:23:32] <greek> ... and my delegated binding signature looks like this: $("div#tabs").on("sortreceive", "tr.spec_row", function(event, ui) { alert("test"); });
[01:23:57] <greek> That exact signature is used for all the other events, and those all execute perfectly. So I'm a bit confused.
[01:24:02] <jacks_appendix> Little situation. I have to run two version of jquery on the same page but I don't have access the the head of the document so I cannot run the first version as noConflict. Would modifying the section of jquery where window.jQuery is set be enough to avoid issues?
[01:25:16] <jacks_appendix> meaning, would changing: window.jQuery = window.$ = jQuery; TO >> window.myJQuery = window.$ = jQuery; work?
[01:27:01] <eregi> I'm not able to recreate the error in my jsfiddle, so here's the actual link to the page - http://tooth.beberry.lv/trd/team if you click on the pictures, the right side animation isn't working correctly, moslty it jumps up and down before the end. any ideas?
[01:44:17] <jacks_appendix> Hello. I need to run two version of jquery on the same page but without using noConflict. Would a find and replace for the jQuery and $ variables be reliable to change the variable names?
[01:44:31] <blackspotwiggins> ?noconflict @ jacks_appendix
[01:44:31] <bot-t> jacks_appendix, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[01:45:38] <jacks_appendix> blackspotwiggins, I don't think I can use noconflict because I don't have access, and can't modify the version of jquery loaded first.
[01:45:56] <blackspotwiggins> wat.
[01:45:56] <b-ot> Proof of it didnt wwebsite as on the internet
[01:46:47] <jacks_appendix> blackspotwiggins, i'm working on a big project that's using a dinosaur fossil called jquery 1.3.2. There is tons of code using $' which I cannot modify
[01:47:32] <jacks_appendix> I need to use an up to date version for my own part of the build which I will load
[01:47:34] <blackspotwiggins> and?
[01:47:55] <jacks_appendix> This version cannot overwrite $ and jQuery.
[01:48:00] <blackspotwiggins> and?
[01:48:26] <jacks_appendix> blackspotwiggins, you have an attitude problem.
[01:49:06] <jacks_appendix> blackspotwiggins, It is my understanding that noConflict would have to be placed on the first version and not the second. If i'm wrong, you can easily just say that instead of being a dick.
[01:50:14] <blackspotwiggins> you can use it on anything
[01:50:22] <blackspotwiggins> your assertion that you cant use it for some whatever reason is wrong
[01:50:34] <blackspotwiggins> if you load 1.3.2 at any point, it WILL take control of the variables
[01:50:41] <blackspotwiggins> and the only way to revert that is to use noconflict
[01:51:01] <blackspotwiggins> and you could have easily read the docs
[01:52:06] <jacks_appendix> blackspotwiggins, thank you. I appreciate the help. I have seen many examples that always show noConflict placed on the first version so i assumed that was standard procedure.
[01:53:29] <Spikes> Guys, is it normal that i can't detect click event when listened element is situated inside of the button element? Example: http://jsfiddle.net/MqCwx
[01:53:41] <Iszak> Anyone got suggestions on how to improve this? jquery-custom-build.com
[01:53:57] <lolmaus> seutje, thank you ^_^
[01:54:02] <seutje> wait what?
[01:54:04] <Spikes> But only in Firefox
[01:54:29] <Spikes> Apparently, it works just fine in Chrome
[01:54:35] <blackspotwiggins> Iszak, maybe remove beta and rc versions?
[01:54:49] <Iszak> blackspotwiggins why's that?
[01:55:06] <blackspotwiggins> i guess they are not really useful since 1.8.0 and .1 are out
[01:55:18] <Iszak> Good point, thanks.
[01:55:32] <blackspotwiggins> other than that, maybe use cdn to cache the compiled files?
[01:55:42] <blackspotwiggins> so you only compile each combination once
[01:56:05] <Iszak> v2, what do I look like? I'm made of money!
[01:56:21] <seutje> :o
[01:56:34] * seutje gets ready to hit Iszak like a piñata
[01:57:59] <Iszak> blackspotwiggins what about the "Master" label? Think I should call it latest/development?
[01:58:01] <Iszak> seutje why? D:
[01:58:16] <Iszak> did I steal your idea?
[01:58:27] <seutje> u said ur made of money
[01:58:44] <blackspotwiggins> Iszak, master is ok
[01:58:45] <Iszak> Sorry, I mean "What, do I look like I'm made of money?"
[01:58:50] <blackspotwiggins> as it's the latest, always
[01:58:51] <Iszak> CDN's are expensive.
[01:59:00] <Iszak> blackspotwiggins I just thought for non-technical master may be confusing.
[01:59:06] <blackspotwiggins> well
[01:59:22] <blackspotwiggins> non-technical people prolly think removing offset from jquery is confusing
[01:59:30] <Iszak> yeah, probably.
[01:59:32] <Iszak> i'll leave master.
[01:59:43] <blackspotwiggins> maybe change to git master
[02:00:16] <rio{> is it possible to do a "reverse-lookup" with nth-child
[02:00:40] <blackspotwiggins> ?
[02:00:53] <rio{> for example in a list
[02:01:04] <rio{> which nth-child a certain li is
[02:01:18] <Iszak> blackspotwiggins thanks for your suggestions, removed non-stable, will leave master for now :D
[02:01:45] <Iszak> caching all the possibilities is something for the future.
[02:02:01] <Iszak> I'm not so worried about the bandwidth (got a few TB) and by using a CDN it allows linking (which I don't want)
[02:02:16] <seutje> well that's disappointing :(
[02:02:26] <blackspotwiggins> ?index @ rio{
[02:02:26] <bot-t> rio{, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[02:02:44] <Iszak> seutje sorry just don't have the money to do it.
[02:03:32] <seutje> I meant it's disappointing you're not a money piñata
[02:04:01] <rio{> blackspotwiggins: nice thx

[02:07:29] <juria_roberts> how do i use find to get src of an i frame an element?
[02:07:36] <juria_roberts> *inside an element
[02:08:18] <greek> I'll send a postcard all the way from South Africa (with lions and elephants and everything) to whoever manages to solve that!
[02:10:43] <juria_roberts> how do i use find to get src of an i frame inside an element?
[02:10:45] <mehrdad> hi, is there any tool for creating fairly complex jquery animations?
[02:11:37] <mehrdad> i'm not familiar with flash development and silverlight not so much too, so i need to know if there's good tooling support for jquery
[02:14:24] <juria_roberts> why doesnt jQuery(elements[2]).find('iframe') work where elements[2] is another iframe?
[02:15:27] <mehrdad> so i take it jquery tooling support is horrible
[02:17:23] <seutje> take what you will, but I have no clue what you mean
[02:17:43] <seutje> ?contents @ juria_roberts
[02:17:44] <bot-t> juria_roberts, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[02:19:41] <juria_roberts> seutje: thanks
[02:20:34] <Aamir> greek: receive event works only with connected list
[02:21:01] <greek> Aamir, it is connected
[02:21:05] <Aamir> ahh
[02:25:38] <mehrdad> seutje: alright, i'll handcode it as usual, but one part has me completely puzzled, how do you handle printing in jquery?
[02:25:55] <blackspotwiggins> window.print() ?
[02:26:12] <mehrdad> yeah, well, and formatting?
[02:26:18] <blackspotwiggins> css?
[02:26:28] <seutje> I'm confused
[02:26:35] <mehrdad> wait, that's not what i mean
[02:26:42] <blackspotwiggins> what do you mean
[02:26:43] <mehrdad> a momennt plz
[02:26:48] <seutje> did all of web development get replaced by jQuery while I was asleep? :x
[02:26:54] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, yep
[02:27:10] <seutje> knew I shouldn't have gone to sleep
[02:27:15] <blackspotwiggins> didnt you read the cybernews this morning?
[02:27:16] <mehrdad> lol , i'll explain in a sec
[02:27:30] <seutje> I intentionally read news a week late
[02:27:36] <seutje> to weed out hoaxes and stuff
[02:28:06] <mehrdad> look, i want to print out an invoice
[02:28:18] <seutje> works fairly well, until there's a massive riot going on and I just happen to go there by accident
[02:28:20] <mehrdad> formatted like a regular paper invoice
[02:28:38] <blackspotwiggins> mehrdad, generate a pdf
[02:28:40] <mehrdad> how complex is that in jquery?
[02:29:02] <seutje> I usually do that on the server side
[02:29:12] <seutje> coz u gotta e-mail it and stuff
[02:29:17] <mehrdad> basically i want to replicate a flash windows app using pure jquery
[02:29:26] <blackspotwiggins> lol wat
[02:29:31] <blackspotwiggins> first you ask about animations
[02:29:32] <mehrdad> yeah sounds crazy
[02:29:36] <blackspotwiggins> then about printing invoices
[02:29:45] <mehrdad> but i'm gathering info right now
[02:29:52] <seutje> no starbursts?
[02:30:13] <mehrdad> no now, maybe later though :p
[02:30:20] <greek> What's the best way to fire an event after an input field has been changed? Whenever the user updates the quantity of an item in an input text field, I want to re-calculate the totals displayed on the page.
[02:30:25] <mehrdad> but seriously, pleae guide me in the right direction
[02:30:28] <greek> On change? Or keyup? Or what?
[02:30:32] <seutje> if the data is on the page, which it prolly should be, it's just CSS, isn't it?
[02:30:35] <mehrdad> it is either jquery or no money for me
[02:30:44] <seutje> strip some colors, change some fonts, ...
[02:31:08] <blackspotwiggins> mehrdad, did you fall into a buzzword well or what?
[02:31:10] <Aamir> greek:  here we go http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/zXGL8/2/
[02:31:25] <blackspotwiggins> are you allowed to use a browser window, or not enough jquery there?
[02:32:36] <mehrdad> blackspotwiggins: it all runs in a browser window, what do you mean?
[02:33:16] <blackspotwiggins> i mean your obsession with using jquery is not good
[02:33:23] <blackspotwiggins> if you want to actually achieve optimal results
[02:33:56] <mehrdad> blackspotwiggins: that's my bad, i didn't say 'no' to a client, but i didn't promise her either
[02:34:18] <mehrdad> now i want to know if i can do a good looking catalog app in pure jq
[02:34:27] <mehrdad> so to tell her the definite answer
[02:34:36] <mehrdad> wish i knew silverlight or flash
[02:34:45] <seutje> I don't even know what "pure jq" means
[02:34:50] <j_wright> there is a javascript library for creating pdfs, not sure how good it is and the demo page isn't registered anymore
[02:34:54] <mehrdad> there's Expression Blend for Silverlight, but i'm not sure how RAD is that
[02:35:00] <blackspotwiggins> why does the client even care what technology is used
[02:35:12] <mehrdad> she doesn't care, i do
[02:35:35] <seutje> so are you allowed to use vanilla jq?
[02:35:40] <mehrdad> since it is a catalog presentation app, it needs fluid and nice animations
[02:35:45] <blackspotwiggins> ghetto jq is where it's at yo
[02:35:51] <mehrdad> and then flash comes to mind which i know jack shit about
[02:35:57] <seutje> you know, like good old native DOM methods and stuff
[02:36:03] <blackspotwiggins> lol
[02:36:06] <blackspotwiggins> flash == fluid
[02:36:08] <blackspotwiggins> in what universe
[02:36:11] <seutje> wat
[02:36:11] <b-ot> man i really tought the business of JS was to call function
[02:36:21] <seutje> my head hurts now, I need a smoke
[02:36:25] <mehrdad> i said, that's what to comes to mind first
[02:36:27] <j_wright> mehrdad: https://github.com/Marak/pdf.js YMMV
[02:36:32] <fotoflo> >
[02:36:34] <mehrdad> let's toss aside bigotry
[02:37:50] <mehrdad> j_wright: can i use it to format the invoice?
[02:38:08] <mehrdad> so a buch of textboxes and other controls end up as  a regualr papaerish invoice?
[02:38:20] <fotoflo> hi all. quick question. I have a <select><option value = "1">a</option><option value = "2">b</option><option value = "3">c</option></select> and I want to select the option with the string "b" … how do you do this?
[02:38:38] <mehrdad> i've done something like that in a windows forms app using excel apis, but win form isn't the best choice here
[02:38:41] <blackspotwiggins> mehrdad, generate it on the server side
[02:38:44] <blackspotwiggins> it's much much easier
[02:38:53] <mehrdad> there's no server
[02:39:08] <mehrdad> as i said, it's either pure jq, js, or no money for me
[02:39:10] <blackspotwiggins> so you send the person a collection of html and js files?
[02:39:17] <blackspotwiggins> you need to host it somewhere
[02:39:25] <j_wright> where does the data for the invoice come from
[02:39:51] <mehrdad> she's gonna distribute it on CDs, her choice whatever
[02:40:04] <mehrdad> it's static media
[02:40:31] <blackspotwiggins> holy shit :D
[02:40:48] <blackspotwiggins> maybe you should go for a native app instead
[02:40:49] <mehrdad> a customer chooses the items in the catalog and in the end an invoice is genrated which can be printed out
[02:41:01] <blackspotwiggins> or you know, i heard internet is popular these days
[02:41:15] <mehrdad> blackspotwiggins: i can't dictate her
[02:41:31] <fotoflo> I'm trying to use $('#selectID option[name="a"]') to do this… not working. any one know the best way?
[02:41:35] <mehrdad> and as i said earlier, i have no experience with flash or silverlight
[02:42:07] <mehrdad> so it seems it will be some heavy lifting using just jq/js
[02:42:29] <blackspotwiggins> i'd just say no at this point
[02:42:29] <mehrdad> heavy weight lifting i mean
[02:42:33] <j_wright> there is also jsPDF i see
[02:43:13] <sh0ne> can I tie datepicker to a span element?
[02:43:58] <mehrdad> j_wright: it seems there are many js libs for that purpose, but can i format the invoice using them?
[02:44:09] <j_wright> 'format'?
[02:44:26] <mehrdad> blackspotwiggins: so what do you suggets ? just tell her "no i can't do this?"
[02:44:54] <blackspotwiggins> yep
[02:45:02] <mehrdad> now i'm leaning more toward giving Expression Blend a spin for what it's worth
[02:45:31] <j_wright> why not just create a decently formatted html page with a print style sheet and use js to pop up the print dialog?
[02:46:06] <mehrdad> a drop of sweat now
[02:46:07] <AzizLight> Hi everybody
[02:46:12] <mehrdad> i'm certainly worked up :/
[02:46:54] <mehrdad> j_wright: good idea, but will it look paperish?
[02:47:11] <j_wright> when printed it will look very paperish
[02:47:14] <j_wright> heh
[02:47:25] <j_wright> i don't know what paperish means
[02:47:30] <AzizLight> What does jQuery.parseJSON() returns if I pass an json array as argument please? I have the current code and it throws an error saying that each is not defined for the object: http://pastie.org/4737220
[02:47:44] <mehrdad> i mean no trace of web artifacts like textboxes and borders you know
[02:48:19] <j_wright> mehrdad: that's why you create the page, have a print stylesheet to make it look nice printed
[02:48:56] <blackspotwiggins> AzizLight, you dont actually show what you pass to parsejson
[02:49:03] <mehrdad> hmm
[02:50:13] <mehrdad> since my experience with all that is poor, i'm hesitant to nod her right now
[02:50:27] <j_wright> why, since this is all on a cdrom, install a web server on the user's computer so you can actually do this server side
[02:50:38] <AzizLight> blackspotwiggins: that's the json: http://pastie.org/4737246
[02:51:21] <mehrdad> install a server? i might as well go on creating asp.net pages then
[02:52:05] <mehrdad> you see, installing a server for this stuff seems rather overkill
[02:52:09] <j_wright> whatever floats your boat, but there are lighter httpds than iis
[02:52:34] <seutje> so it just needs to be static?
[02:52:46] <mehrdad> j_wright: do you mean using a server is a must or just for easing the work?
[02:52:55] <mehrdad> seutje:  yes, no db
[02:53:05] <Raghuram> is there any way to check if the .net control is enabled or disabled using jquery, where as in case of Javascript we can directly find the element by id and check the status
[02:53:32] <seutje> well, I suppose u can just store ur stuff in json files and read them out or something
[02:54:02] <diverdude> Hello, anybody knows why this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/YE8SX/4/ gives error: Uncaught ReferenceError: google is not defined  ?
[02:54:28] <seutje> diverdude: google maps isn't included/loaded
[02:54:29] <mehrdad> what j_wright suggested though sounds more logical
[02:54:51] <mehrdad> and it doesn't require a web server
[02:55:07] <diverdude> seutje: i have included it
[02:56:28] <blackspotwiggins> lol, install a server on cd, run it and use it to display static html
[02:56:33] <blackspotwiggins> that's.. nice
[02:56:43] <blackspotwiggins> AzizLight, that's not json
[02:56:44] <diverdude> seutje: ?
[02:56:53] <blackspotwiggins> that's js literals
[02:57:19] <mehrdad> blackspotwiggins: heh :D
[02:58:03] <AzizLight> blackspotwiggins: how would I parse that with jquery then please?
[02:58:44] <seutje> diverdude: yeah, it is in the resources tab, but doesn't seem to be included
[02:58:53] <mehrdad> j_wright: i could just generate an invoice table from the items
[02:59:12] <diverdude> seutje: mmm thats quite strange
[02:59:20] <seutje> yeah, quite
[02:59:23] <blackspotwiggins> AzizLight, you don't need to parse it, it's already a js variable
[02:59:28] <mehrdad> no heavy css styling needed then
[03:00:12] <seutje> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/YE8SX/6/ error is gone
[03:00:13] <j_wright> sure whatever markup you want
[03:00:53] <diverdude> seutje: what did you do
[03:00:53] <diverdude> ah
[03:00:53] <diverdude> included it
[03:00:53] <diverdude> strange
[03:01:03] <seutje> diverdude: just added a script tag with it
[03:01:26] <diverdude> seutje: but still its strange, because the             google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', function() { is not being executed
[03:01:30] <gotmilk_> hi im trying to remove <li data-theme="" id="morebtn"> with remove
[03:01:36] <gotmilk_> but i got displayed undefined
[03:01:53] <gotmilk_> is there a way to remove it
[03:01:58] <mehrdad> hardon
[03:02:00] <mehrdad> big one
[03:02:23] <gotmilk_> $('#morebtn').remove();
[03:02:26] <mehrdad> holy shit
[03:02:26] <gotmilk_> using this command
[03:04:18] <mehrdad> fucking pervert workers
[03:04:22] <diverdude> seutje: any idea why?
[03:04:31] <seutje> nope
[03:06:02] <mehrdad> oh god....
[03:06:14] <mehrdad> ok, enough bullshit
[03:06:16] <mehrdad> thanks guys
[03:07:02] <mehrdad> i'm almost settled as to what to do now
[03:07:38] <seutje> diverdude: aaah, think I figured it out
[03:07:47] <mehrdad> no js pdf libs needed
[03:08:02] <seutje> diverdude: jsfiddle wraps the javascript bits in a window load handler already
[03:08:13] <seutje> so that code is run when window load has already fired
[03:08:20] <seutje> so it doesn't fire anymore
[03:09:02] <seutje> diverdude: works like this: http://jsfiddle.net/YE8SX/8/
[03:09:10] <seutje> but I guess it's kinda silly that way
[03:11:57] <AzizLight> blackspotwiggins: I'm pretty sure the string I pasted you is a json string, rails rendered an array of objects in json and returned it. here is the string again http://pastie.org/4737327. When I use parseJSON it seems to works. When I console.log the result it shows me [Object, Object]. How do I loop through that using jquery please?
[03:12:26] <diverdude> seutje: hmm yeah ok
[03:12:39] <diverdude> seutje: seems my example cannot run on fiddle then :/
[03:12:47] <seutje> diverdude: sure it can
[03:13:35] <Palanivel> hi friends......i need ur help......while file upload i wanna filter the files for example i want to show only pdf files to user.............
[03:13:43] <Palanivel> i searched google lot
[03:13:52] <Palanivel> any idea please let share with me
[03:14:20] <diverdude> seutje: the thing i was trying to illustrate is that on my computer, similar code prints map2 twice in this line: console.log($this[0]); instead of map1 and map2 which i don't understand. Is that because of the code construct?
[03:14:50] <rgr> can one set a break on "the nect checkbox click" easily enough in the chrome debugger?
[03:14:54] <rgr> next
[03:15:06] <rgr> (ie without knowing the location of the code called)
[03:15:56] <Aamir> .tweet jaz303
[03:16:04] <Aamir> tweet jaz303
[03:19:21] <rgr> aha, of course it is : event listenders
[03:22:01] <diverdude> seutje: ?
[03:25:42] <eregi> Can anyone please take a look at http://tooth.beberry.lv/trd/team and suggest why the #riderInfo box is shaking up and down at the end of its animation? The example worked on my jsfiddle.. http://jsfiddle.net/K2DgQ/19/
[03:50:30] <mehrdad> blackspotwiggins: how do you rate such an application, or any application for that matter?
[03:51:01] <mehrdad> how do i price it? what's the basis? time?
[03:51:51] <mehrdad> anyone else?
[03:54:03] <eregi> is it possible to get the height of an div that's not currently added to the DOM? like ret = "<div class=
[03:54:22] <eregi> <div class="content">Somecontent here</div>
[03:55:25] <guy> I have jQuery cross-browser issue. This works everywhere but IE7-8 http://jsbin.com/welcome/23622/
[03:58:00] <dwt> Hi there, I've got a problem with jquery mobiles button enhancing. That is I've got a button like this: <button><span><span class="desktop">Only shown in desktop layout</span> <span class="mobile">Only shown in mobile layout</span></span></button>
[03:58:12] <dwt> however jquery mobile extracts the full text out of that button when it enhances it
[03:58:46] <dwt> and renders it like this
[03:58:46] <dwt> <div data-corners="true" data-shadow="true" data-iconshadow="true" data-wrapperels="span" data-icon="null" data-iconpos="null" data-theme="a" data-inline="false" data-mini="true" class="ui-btn ui-shadow ui-btn-corner-all ui-mini ui-btn-block ui-btn-up-a" aria-disabled="false"><span class="ui-btn-inner ui-btn-corner-all"><span class="ui-btn-text">
[03:58:46] <dwt>             Force Gameserver Data Reload        Reload Server
[03:58:46] <dwt>           </span></span><button id="7dc9f349e3870dea40f94a44c39c1b35d55417b0action" name="action" type="submit" class="btnText submit force-reload ui-btn ui-shadow ui-btn-corner-all ui-mini ui-btn-hidden ui-btn-up-a" value="force_reload" data-corners="true" data-shadow="true" data-iconshadow="true" data-wrapperels="span" data-theme="a" data-mini="true" aria-disabled="false"><span class="ui-btn-inner ui-btn-corner-all"><span class="ui-btn-text">
[03:58:47] <dwt>             <span><span class="desktop">Force Gameserver Data Reload</span>        <span class="mobile">Reload Server</span></span>
[03:58:47] <dwt>           </span></span></button></div>
[03:59:28] <dwt> which is entirely not what I want. Can someby please give a hint how I have to configure jquery mobile to actually take the html of the button element as the basis of the enhanced html of the button instead of it's 'text()'?
[03:59:39] <dwt> So far the docs haven't yielded anything. :/
[04:03:10] <juha_> awesome pastes, thanks
[04:03:15] <juha_> ?p @ dwt

[04:08:04] <sh0ne> and then to change text in span on date pick..
[04:14:44] <gotmilk_> wahts the best tool
[04:14:48] <gotmilk_> to go step by step
[04:14:51] <gotmilk_> over the js code

[04:15:00] <gotmilk_> perhaps
[04:15:06] <Pietertje> how can i keep text contained within a fieldset
[04:15:13] <Pietertje> my text is running out of the fieldset width
[04:16:59] <seutje> ?seen diverdude
[04:16:59] <b-ot> seutje, I saw diverdude 28m 41s ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[04:17:34] <seutje> b-ot: tell diverdude not sure what you're trying to accomplish, but afaict, it should just log the window object twice, since that is what's firing the load event
[04:17:34] <b-ot> seutje, I’ll tell diverdude about that.
[04:26:41] <softmanpetro> how to select all input type text not in a div admin filter ? I've tried $('div.not(".sf_admin_filter] input[type=text]')
[04:26:51] <softmanpetro> but no luck
[04:27:17] <roowilliams> hello. i am very new to jquery, and i am trying to get a library that connects to cosm (online data service) to return a value that i can use to set the css width value of a div with. The documentation is really concise and seems straight forward but i can't figure out what i am doing wrong. anyone around fancy helping me? i think it's probably quite a simple thing!
[04:30:08] <lahabana> hey there
[04:30:18] <lahabana> I'm wondering something about .html()
[04:30:31] <lahabana> when I use it to replace elements
[04:30:54] <lahabana> does it also unbind the handlers attach to the removed elements
[04:31:14] <lahabana> the way .remove or .empty does?
[04:31:50] <seutje> lahabana: I believe it does not
[04:31:55] <lahabana> it's not explained in the doc were as it is explicitly said for the two others
[04:32:05] <lahabana> ok that what I thought from the code: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L219-259
[04:32:28] <soee> any idea why i cant insert <script> tag with replaceWith() method ?
[04:32:59] <soee> i have content loaded with AJAX and some part of it contains <script> tags but they are not loaded into my destination element
[04:33:10] <lahabana> seutje: great thx :) I'll report a bug about that on the doc's bug tracker
[04:33:20] <Aamir> ?getscript @soee
[04:34:10] <Aamir> lahabana: if element is removed than the event cannot be triggered anyway ?
[04:34:35] <lahabana> yes but the handler etc is still in memory…
[04:34:40] <lahabana> it's not really clean
[04:34:52] <lahabana> is it?
[04:37:05] <Aamir> lahabana:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/JdUNH/ ?
[04:38:00] <lahabana> Aamir: and?
[04:38:03] <seutje> actually, looks like it does
[04:38:39] <seutje> -> http://jsfiddle.net/JdUNH/1/ doesn't
[04:38:45] <seutje> Aamir's does, I think
[04:39:16] <dwt> upon further inspection this is jquery mobile bug https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3975 that hit me
[04:39:17] <dwt> :_(
[04:39:24] <lahabana> hmm I see
[04:39:43] <Aamir> hummm so this mean that jQuery .html('') does remove the events as well :|
[04:39:45] <dwt> Is fixed in 1.2 - which I don't want to use till it's .1 after 1.2
[04:39:53] <seutje> Aamir: I guess
[04:39:59] <seutje> iono, this is my first day using jQuery
[04:39:59] <lahabana> Well I'll report it in the doc to add it :)
[04:40:09] <Aamir> let me try binding click with just js
[04:40:43] <ravenzz> how bad would be override the jquery bind function to wrap as much as possible in a try/catch block and be able to "log" errors?
[04:40:45] <soee> Aaaarg, but its not an external file and this code is generated dynamically with page code
[04:42:24] <seutje> ravenzz: sounds like a can of worms you don't want to open
[04:43:51] <ravenzz> I know
[04:44:10] <ravenzz> but I don't see any other solution
[04:44:52] <seutje> what are you trying to accomplish?
[04:45:12] <Aamir> lahabana: http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/JdUNH/2/ i guess query does remove events binder to the element if you use jQuery's html('')
[04:45:27] <ravenzz> well we need to log and be noticed of js errors
[04:45:40] <lahabana> lahabana: ok cool!
[04:45:41] <Aamir> jQuery*
[04:46:10] <ravenzz> a lot of errors do not trigger window.onerror
[04:46:31] <ravenzz> which is quite bad
[04:47:07] <ravenzz> typos and other execptions/errors won't be noticed
[04:47:25] <seutje> Aamir: but only for jQuery's own event handlers, it seems: http://jsfiddle.net/JdUNH/3/
[04:47:42] <seutje> (ignore the silly construct there :D)
[04:48:25] <lahabana> Aamir: cool thx!
[04:49:00] <Aamir> yes thats true so the answer of the original question is that jQuery does remove events from the deleted element  (consider you bind events using jQuery) :)
[04:49:25] <lahabana> ok great
[04:49:28] <seutje> guess I couldn't have been more off with my original answer :<
[04:49:54] <lahabana> seutje: it was yes or no anyway ;)
[04:50:01] <lahabana> 1 chance out of 2
[04:50:07] <Aamir> seutje:   seutje: lahabana: I believe it does not :D
[04:50:33] <seutje> I wasn't lying at the time
[04:50:39] <seutje> I really did believe it did not
[04:50:42] <seutje> I swears!
[04:50:57] <hasse> A simple plugin for smooth scrolling? anyone?
[04:52:20] <Aamir> hasse:     $("html,body").animate({ scrollTop: 100}, 500 );
[04:53:08] <hasse> Aamir: Lovely! Thanks
[04:53:17] <sakro_> hello, i have made a div slide out left, http://www.blackmountainmedia.ca/ the text warning do not click here in far right
[04:53:27] <sakro_> but it only happens in firefox not in google chrome and IE any ideas why
[04:54:51] <seutje> that gif is so reminiscent of geocities :')
[04:54:54] <Aamir> sakro_:  don't use console.clear();
[04:55:04] <Aamir> i think it works only in firefox
[04:55:28] <sakro_> ok i will try sir
[04:55:34] <Aamir> seutje:  yeah, remind me 'under construction' signs
[05:06:12] <Aha2Y> Can someone say me why the jQuery tabs don't have style? http://aha2y.nl/tfm/#tabs-1
[05:09:36] <eregi> Hi! Is it possible to determine the height of a div before it's being added to the html? I need to get the height of ret = "<div class='content'>Some text here</div>"; Currently I'm thinking about adding it to the body with display:none and after determening the height - remove it..
[05:14:57] <Cork> eregi: no the element needs to be rendered for the browser to know how much space the content take, how wide the element can be
[05:15:06] <Cork> how if the text wraps
[05:15:15] <Cork> and what height that results in
[05:15:46] <Cork> s/how if the/if the/
[05:16:00] <eregi> Cork, ok Thank you! So I'll copy it to the body, get the height and remove it.
[05:16:40] <Cork> eregi: correction it doens't need to be rendered
[05:16:54] <Cork> the calculation happens before its actually visibly rendered
[05:17:03] <Cork> small difference, but anyway
[05:17:21] <eregi> So how to get the height?
[05:17:25] <Cork> its calculated as soon as the html is added to the dom
[05:17:34] <eregi> yes, that's what I was thinking about
[05:17:36] <Cork> rendering happens after your function ends
[05:17:50] <Cork> so you don't need to add it, set an event and wait for it to render
[05:18:00] <Cork> thats what i meant
[05:18:10] <eregi> The display can be set to none if it's needed.
[05:18:20] <Cork> you will get height=0 if you do :)
[05:18:36] <Cork> display: none; collapses the element
[05:18:43] <Cork> but like i said thats not an issue
[05:18:54] <Cork> just add the element normally and remove it before your function ends
[05:18:59] <Cork> and it won't ever be visible
[05:29:54] <r1card> If I specify multiple animations at once they seem to play in queue, can I do something about it?
[05:30:10] <r1card> I want to simultaneously animate some elements, but not all have the same end properties.
[05:30:11] <tomboy64> hello folks
[05:30:15] <r1card> I can't select them at once.
[05:32:30] <tomboy64> i want to program a userscript for scriptish/greasemonkey. i verified that jquery is being loaded - but i can't get ajaxStart or ajaxSuccess to get fired.
[05:32:43] <tomboy64> suggestions for that?
[05:33:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone ever tried this? http://jquerytools.org/download/
[05:35:39] <kborchers> ecky--ptang-zoob: in my experience it was awful … may be better now (doubt it) but i remember the docs being awful and the api's not working right and trying to read the source was a nightmare
[05:36:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ic
[05:37:44] <r1card> queue: false, yuppeee!
[05:37:46] <r1card> :D
[05:46:07] <eregi> Are there any known bugs for animate the height? Currently mine animation reduces the height til 1/2 and only then increases it to the intended one..
[05:49:35] <eregi> The animation kinda bouncess..
[05:57:08] <jomofcw> Hello !
[05:57:32] <pangelovski> hi
[05:57:35] <hooloovoo> jomofcw: heya!
[05:57:41] <jomofcw> i'm trying to know the submit button I click that fire the submit event of a form. How can I know it, please ?
[05:57:44] <jomofcw> =)
[05:58:18] <hooloovoo> jomofcw: you have many submit buttons?
[05:58:26] <jomofcw> hooloovoo yup.
[05:58:28] <hooloovoo> sec
[06:01:02] <rio{> $('.selector').draggable(); isn't this the only thing you need to do with jquery ui?
[06:01:16] <jomofcw> I find this "solution" : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5721724/jquery-how-to-get-which-button-was-clicked-upon-form-submission
[06:01:32] <jomofcw> rio{ it depend what you want to do :) ?
[06:02:14] <rio{> Oh nm... forgot to add .js in the include :S:S
[06:03:11] <hooloovoo> jomofcw: hmmm well it seems it's not in the event
[06:03:20] <slavka`> hey guys... i am trying to find what plugin is controlling the image slider... ive tried using the "Event Listeners" panel and i can see there is a click event on an element but i still cant work out what plugin is actually tied to it... is there any tips on how to track that down?
[06:03:54] <hooloovoo> jomofcw: so maybe something like $("form").on("click", "input[type=button]", function() { var clicked = this; //Here it is })
[06:05:01] <hooloovoo> jomofcw: the one on stackoverflow works too.
[06:05:09] <hooloovoo> none of them are very pretty, but it'll work =)
[06:05:55] <jomofcw> hooloovoo yea I agree ^^ anyway, thanks for your help :).
[06:06:35] <hooloovoo> jomofcw: np!
[06:07:12] <slavka`> any suggestions to my question?
[06:10:05] <Rickardo1> In chrome disabled radiobuttons aren't disabled.. just a stop sign when hovering but can still select id
[06:10:07] <Rickardo1> it
[06:10:23] <arielserafini> slavka`, can't you look at what scripts are being loaded to find out?
[06:10:57] <user_corrupt> howdy folks..I'm quite new to javascript/jquery and Im trying to create a javascript/jquery function that I can call that will open a link to an iframe using fancybox...im using Easy Fancybox in wordpress, and the way that I am currently able to open this iframe with fancybox is to create a text link with the class "fancybox-iframe" and click on it...any advice greatly appreciated
[06:11:11] <user_corrupt> slavka is my moms name
[06:11:14] <Doumie> how do i only get webpage headers?
[06:11:21] <Doumie> without loading the full content of the site
[06:12:33] <arielserafini> user_corrupt, take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/STgGM/
[06:12:39] <arielserafini> (from the fancybox page)
[06:13:05] <user_corrupt> thanks a lot man
[06:13:16] <user_corrupt> who knew they had such resources there
[06:13:18] <user_corrupt> heh
[06:14:46] <arielserafini> user_corrupt, do you know where to go from there?
[06:14:57] <arielserafini> you need to call fancybox.open() from a click event
[06:15:06] <user_corrupt> hard to say, i feel the duty to try my best though
[06:15:45] <user_corrupt> well, i have some php that i want to use to call the function at the right time
[06:15:56] <user_corrupt> do i still need to use click event?
[06:16:02] <arielserafini> ah, no
[06:16:09] <user_corrupt> okey doke, thank you
[06:16:22] <arielserafini> my bad, i just assumed you wanted that
[06:16:25] <arielserafini> :)
[06:17:44] <docmur> I have a strange issue where this function wont execute the window change to demo.html, but it will exeucte the statement in the else to index.html.   login_id is 1 when it returns from signin.php http://pastebin.com/J7YWg7mQ
[06:17:49] <docmur> can anyone see what is wrong?
[06:19:10] <diverdude> How can I  programatically invoke the "drag/resize marker/shape" option of the drawingmanager in the gmap API?
[06:19:10] <b-ot> diverdude, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[06:19:55] <arielserafini> ? demo @ docmur
[06:20:03] <arielserafini> er
[06:20:08] <arielserafini> docmur, can you make a jsfiddle?
[06:20:50] <diverdude> b-ot: read
[06:20:50] <b-ot> diverdude, from seutje, 2h 3m ago: not sure what you're trying to accomplish, but afaict, it should just log the window object twice, since that is what's firing the load event
[06:23:54] <docmur> This is what jsfiddle will let me post, I can't seem to add the php script, but I've debugged the php and it's echoing back 1 for login_id, http://jsfiddle.net/6kurF/1/
[06:25:23] <arielserafini> docmur, you're not supposed to add php in there, just paste the generated html from the php
[06:25:27] <arielserafini> looking now
[06:25:35] <docmur> kk thx :-)
[06:25:53] <seutje> docmur: what type is the response?
[06:26:10] <docmur> just an integer number 1, 2, etc....
[06:26:24] <docmur> it's the ID from a database query which is defined as id int(11)
[06:27:33] <jomofcw> using the colorbox plugin, I just can't understand why I have many colorbox in the DOM :/...
[06:28:47] <sh0ne> how can I stop JQueryUI adding id and class attributes on $('#some-element-id').html() ?
[06:28:53] <seutje> docmur: I meant mime type
[06:30:27] <docmur> this is the php; http://pastebin.com/uEC3Dv3A,  UTF-8 is character set defined for the HTML, if that is what you asking for
[06:34:45] <seutje> docmur: I guessed it was html: http://jsfiddle.net/6kurF/4/
[06:35:58] <seutje> added a e.preventDefault and mangles your data object so the echo would come out properly
[06:41:39] <docmur> thanks
[06:43:31] <docmur> it was the UTF-8

[06:51:04] <hlve> o_o
[06:51:13] <jammsen> as always =)
[06:51:30] <hlve> lol :p
[06:51:42] <jammsen> ie should be banned!
[06:51:59] <hlve> indeed
[06:52:09] <hlve> but no other browser supports active-x, which is essential for one section of my website for customers
[06:52:10] <hlve> ;(
[06:52:27] <jammsen> there was a version where they switched colors, #FFFFFF with #000000 and reverse -.-
[06:52:39] <jammsen> opera too :o
[06:53:45] <pachet> jammsen: to answer your question, yes, it is using jquery
[06:54:05] <jammsen> pachet: which function or effect is that?
[06:55:09] <jammsen> pachet: looks like a fadein or slidein
[06:56:48] <NodeX> h1ve : what "doesn't" work in IE8
[06:57:02] <NodeX> normaly it's the usage of a reserved word that screws things up
[06:57:57] <seutje> IE gets so much shit, when they came up with half the shit you use on a daily basis
[06:58:25] <seutje> and IE10 is furthest along in implementing the new layout shits, last time I checked
[06:58:34] <pachet> jammsen: .slideUp(0).slideDown('slow', function(){$(this).animate({opacity:1},'slow')
[06:58:40] <pachet> *)
[06:59:04] <pachet> bleh, morning syntax :[ you get the idea
[06:59:16] <jammsen> pachet: i have to insert to element on first position right?
[06:59:54] <pachet> jammsen: not necessarily, it looks like it searches that container for any elements with the 'ajax_hidden' class and applies that effect to them
[06:59:58] <pachet> if that's what you mean
[07:00:45] <jammsen> pachet: i want to recreate that on a test page, so i would take a container div and and some <p> or so to try it, thats what i meant
[07:03:06] <anli__> The slider button on http://papermashup.com/jquery-ui-slider/ seems to not work very well, anyone that have tested it?
[07:04:32] <anli__> Ah, not including the jquery css was the solution
[07:14:16] <NET||abuse> hi folks,, i've been looking at the gallerific plugin, but it looks kind of out of date, still uses 1.3.2 as default jquery version
[07:14:32] <NET||abuse> galleriffic, sorry spelled that wrong.
[07:14:43] <NET||abuse> would any one suggest something better?
[07:15:30] <NET||abuse> i have a bit of php which renders the content of a directory which design guys upload pngs for our project. so it's a view gallery for our product.
[07:15:56] <NET||abuse> so i just poopulate a ul with li's for each image in the directory, now i have it working except for just showing the image on the page.
[07:16:23] <NET||abuse> but that's not the important bit,
[07:16:40] <NET||abuse> i guess i'm curious to learn a really nice plugin for an adaptable gallery layout thing?
[07:16:58] <NET||abuse> this one is quite nice, but if there's a better option i don't know about that would be great to hear it.
[07:17:25] <Aha2Y> Can someone tell me why the second table is showing weird? http://aha2y.nl/tfm/ (Datatable)
[07:18:06] <pangelovski> I'm trying to set the back button text dynamically based on the previous page header text. is this possible?
[07:18:41] <NET||abuse> pangelovski: do you mean in the browser's back button?
[07:18:56] <pangelovski> no, I mean the header back buton
[07:18:58] <pangelovski> button
[07:19:41] <NET||abuse> pangelovski: you set the table's width to 100px;;
[07:20:12] <pangelovski> not sure i understand what you mean?
[07:20:20] <NET||abuse> oh i mean,, Aha2Y your table's width is 100px for the second one, not 100%
[07:20:39] <NET||abuse> the other table has window.width
[07:20:57] <Aha2Y> NET||abuse, But its not defined in my css.
[07:21:25] <NET||abuse> yup, it's on the element
[07:21:29] <NET||abuse> directly assigned value.
[07:21:50] <Aha2Y> I can't find it...
[07:22:22] <NET||abuse> not sure why myself.
[07:23:04] <NET||abuse> hmm, indent your markup a bit neater, it's hard to read
[07:23:18] <NET||abuse> pangelovski: header back button? on what?
[07:23:49] <NET||abuse> pangelovski: more context to your question please.
[07:23:49] <Aha2Y> NET||abuse, Does jQuery assign that value?
[07:24:01] <NET||abuse> jquery, no, the datatable plugin,, not sure
[07:24:16] <pangelovski> i got a header and a nested listview, and on the header i have a title. now i have a nested list with a back button. I want to set the back button text
[07:24:32] <pangelovski> on the nested list based on the header title in the previous page
[07:25:16] <optraz> i have a ajax function, in the .done(function(data)) , i would like to disable the button that is click in the outer function. what do i need to change?
[07:25:17] <NET||abuse> pangelovski: what's this for? mobile?
[07:25:24] <pangelovski> yes
[07:25:29] <NET||abuse> pangelovski: use jqm
[07:25:47] <anli__> I want a span of a certain div that will have its text right aligned, but I cannot set with on span, do I have to use a div thats a inline-block?
[07:25:59] <anli__> set with => set width
[07:26:47] <NET||abuse> anli__: #css or #html
[07:27:35] <starsinmypockets> So, I'm doing js validation - using preventDefault... when the validation passes, how do I return control to the forms regular submit function?
[07:29:32] <NET||abuse> starsinmypockets: don't preventDefault until you fail validation.
[07:29:38] <pachet> starsinmypockets: well, normally you woul----^
[07:29:51] <pachet> just return true from the submit handler if it passes, false if not
[07:29:59] <NET||abuse> if(!this.validate()){event.preventDefault();}
[07:30:29] <starsinmypockets> NET||abuse - roger dodger tx
[07:30:58] * NET||abuse needs to go back to work,, oh, but my origional question, anyone have a good suggestion regarding alternative to galleriffic? 
[07:31:14] <NET||abuse> want to get familiar with a decent up to date gallery script.
[07:31:31] <NET||abuse> galleriffic seems a bit old now
[07:31:46] <NET||abuse> well, just my impression considering the age of jquery thye link to in their code
[07:34:23] <NET||abuse> ooh, that is some of the nicest transition work i've seen,, http://www.andyingle.com/bugs/isotope/
[07:34:48] <eregi> Any ideas why the OutterHieght doesn't get the right value? http://tooth.beberry.lv/trd/team it usually returns the height that is smaller than the actual one
[07:34:50] <NET||abuse> well, nicest is perhaps overstatigng, ;)
[07:36:56] <jammsen> $('<p></p>').appendTo('#content'); adds a element to content but after the previous
[07:37:08] <jammsen> how do i add in front of the first?
[07:37:15] <jammsen> i mean before the first
[07:37:30] <arielserafini> jammsen, prependTo()
[07:37:55] <saedelaere> A user clicks on a link in a table. I catch the event in a function and I want to access the same row and get the data of a specific column. Can this be done with jQuery?
[07:37:58] <arielserafini> ?prependTo
[07:37:58] <bot-t> .prependTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the beginning of the target. http://api.jquery.com/prependTo/
[07:38:00] <pachet> sesame street opposites: pertinent since 1976
[07:38:05] <saedelaere> oh the column has an ID
[07:38:30] <pachet> saedelaere: sure
[07:39:00] <saedelaere> pachet: any hints?
[07:39:10] <pachet> $('a').on('click.mynamespace', function(e){e.preventDefault(); $(this).closest('tr').find('.someclass').doSomething(); })
[07:39:16] <pachet> saedelaere^
[07:39:28] <jammsen> arielserafini: thanks dude :)
[07:40:06] <kolix> hey guys
[07:40:24] <anli__> Does not seem to matter if I animate: false in my slider
[07:40:32] <anli__> or animate: true
[07:40:52] <kolix> I'm using the $(window).blur() function to call a function whent he page loses focus, HOWEVER, I also have an iframe on the page and the event is called when the iframe comes into focus
[07:40:58] <kolix> any ideas on how to get by this?
[07:43:23] <kolix> anyone?
[07:44:51] <pachet> kolix: have a separate listener to detect that the iframe has been focused
[07:45:12] <pachet> since focus will typically fire *after* the original element is blurred, you'll need to adjust for that
[07:45:13] <kolix> how can i do that in jquery?
[07:45:40] <pachet> $('#my_iframe').on('focus.mynamespace', function(){/*set some variable flag to indicate that we're in the iframe*/});
[07:45:58] <jammsen> is there a way to tell jquery to view in a div if there is more then 20 <p>'s and delete that <p>'s that are to many?
[07:46:13] <kolix> what's focus.mynamespace?
[07:46:30] <gx> Hey guys, I'm pulling my hair out here. http://www.voicemailsforever.com/save-voicemail/ The audio testimonial on the right works in all browsers except for IE. In IE it gives me the error: Object doesn't support property or method 'jPlayer' and the audio doesn't play. Anyone have any clue how to fix that issue in IE?
[07:46:44] <pachet> $(window).on('blur.mynamespace', function(){setTimeout(check_blur_state,0);}); function check_blur_state(){if ( some_global_variable_telling_us_that_iframe_has_focus === true ) { return; } else /* do whatever */ }
[07:47:06] <jammsen> like 30 paragraphs inside a div, so jquery should delete the 10 that are to much
[07:47:08] <pachet> kolix: its just an event namespace -- good practice to attach your events using them so that you can unbind them specifically at a later time
[07:48:11] <kolix> thanks pachet
[07:48:33] <kolix> what would the onblur look like, when the iframe then loses focus so i can change the global variable?
[07:48:45] <pachet> jammsen: sure, do something like var $set = $('#container p'); if ( $set.length >= 30 ) { $set.slice(30).remove(); }
[07:49:01] <jammsen> slice?
[07:49:10] <pachet> ?.slice() @ jammsen
[07:49:11] <bot-t> jammsen, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[07:49:53] <pachet> kolix: eh, you don't even really need it i don't think -- you can just reset the flag back in check_blur_state
[07:50:28] <pachet> kolix: also, in the interest of not overtly promoting bad practices, there are a lot of ways to not have to use a global for that flag, either
[07:50:33] <pachet> which is preferable
[07:51:01] <pangelovski> why is this not working http://pastebin.com/zb2CYTXP
[07:51:46] <anli__> Is it ok to have 0.1 as step on a jquery ui slider?
[07:51:54] <anli__> Seems to get a lot of TypeError: d.toFixed is not a function
[07:52:45] <kolix> pachet: http://pastie.org/4738844
[07:52:55] <kolix> it's still triggering when i click the iframe
[07:52:59] <kolix> am i doing something wrong?
[07:53:15] <kolix> wait nvm
[07:53:24] <pachet> kolix: like i said, blur will fire first
[07:53:32] <pachet> so you have to defer that until after the iframe focus event fires
[07:54:16] <kolix> hmmm
[07:54:23] <eregi> why I'm getting the wrong height? http://jsfiddle.net/NdL8f/11/
[07:56:10] <kolix2> sorry got disconnected
[07:56:54] <kolix2> pachet, any way you can fiddle this code? - http://pastie.org/4738844
[07:57:05] <kolix2> i don't really understand javascript event propagation
[07:57:29] <seutje> eregi: coz it's set to 2px, outerheight includes the border, so it becomes 4px
[07:57:39] <seutje> eregi: gotta clear the height first, I thinks
[07:57:58] <optraz> the done function in jquery ajax, how can we know exactly how many parameter can be passed in?
[07:58:03] <eregi> is it possible to get the height of an element and it's childs? currently the height returned is without the div objects inside of it.
[07:58:19] <eregi> seutje, look at this example http://jsfiddle.net/NdL8f/12/
[07:58:48] <eregi> it calculates the height only of the parent element, I assume that it's the problem
[07:59:26] <bigmeow> lol
[07:59:32] <seutje> erm
[07:59:41] <seutje> 30px element wrapped withing a 30px element is still only 30px
[07:59:49] <seutje> within*
[07:59:57] <seutje> but yeah, eregi: http://jsfiddle.net/NdL8f/13/
[08:01:33] <ogk1000> anyone know an easy way to fix IE7 png's black bg animation bug
[08:02:59] <seutje> eregi: to illustrate how the outer div will stay 30px regardless of its children: http://jsfiddle.net/YQty7/
[08:04:32] <xckpd7> question: for what reason would jQuery honor things out of order? for instance let's say I do $('element').html('') and then I populate the element... is there any reason that the element would show up with no content?
[08:04:56] <kolix2> pachet, updated using your code
[08:04:58] <kolix2> http://pastie.org/4738922
[08:05:09] <kolix2> now the blur isn't firing at all, any ideas?
[08:05:18] <xckpd7> I don't get why it removes even before I specified it
[08:05:21] <saedelaere> pachet: thanks for the hint!!!
[08:05:40] <pachet> kolix: try messing around with this: http://jsfiddle.net/y7tTE/
[08:06:00] <pachet> kolix ( i couldn't get blur or hover to play nicely with that iframe in FF, so im using mouse events in that example )
[08:06:55] <ogk1000> anyone?
[08:07:56] <kolix2> thank you pachet, i really much appreciate it
[08:08:08] <pachet> no sweat
[08:08:32] <seutje> xckpd7: if none are queued or anything, I guess not
[08:09:02] <stefuNz> hey, i'm doing some automatic actions (for example scrolling a carousel) - when i minimize the window however, it doesn't seem to do anything and when i reactivate the browser window it does all the automatic actions very fast (very ugly!) - how can i avoid that behaviour ?
[08:09:16] <pachet> xckpd7: what do you mean?
[08:09:25] <pachet> dom manip is blocking in nearly all cases
[08:09:28] <pachet> would be a nightmare if it wasnt
[08:09:30] <seutje> stefuNz: what browser?
[08:09:35] <stefuNz> chrome
[08:09:47] <seutje> stefuNz: what carousel?
[08:09:47] <stefuNz> you think it's a browser-specific bug ?
[08:10:05] <seutje> I usually start by trying to recreate it
[08:10:07] <stefuNz> http://code.google.com/p/simple-carousel/
[08:10:07] <pachet> stefuNz: no, it's not browser-specific necessarily
[08:10:34] <pachet> it's just how chrome handles things that are pushed to the stack queue while the page is inactive
[08:10:37] <stefuNz> see the "auto"-feature
[08:10:46] <pachet> everything will fire after the page is reactivated
[08:10:46] <stefuNz> pachet: yes.
[08:11:14] <pachet> stefuNz: you usually see it with canvas animations -- all the calls to reqAnimationFrame will stack and be fired when you tab back
[08:11:32] <seutje> suppose u could pause it when window is blurred or something
[08:13:15] <rio{> How come parents() return an empty array?
[08:13:17] <seutje> seems kinda tedious though
[08:13:36] <optraz> the done function in jquery ajax, how can we know exactly how many parameter can be passed in?
[08:13:58] <pachet> rio{: depends what you're calling it on
[08:14:09] <rio{> a div
[08:14:09] <pachet> usually that's what you'd expect if the element is detached from the DOM
[08:14:38] <pachet> optraz: qualify 'parameters'
[08:14:39] <rio{> hmm it might be so that it hasnt been injected yet
[08:14:51] <pachet> optraz: if you mean 'formal function arguments', have a look at the API
[08:14:55] <pachet> ?.done()
[08:14:56] <bot-t> deferred.done(doneCallbacks, [doneCallbacks]): Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is resolved. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[08:14:56] <eregi> seutje, looks like you are right with http://jsfiddle.net/NdL8f/13/ but it doesn't animate for me, don't know why
[08:15:30] <seutje> eregi: well, ur essentially animating it to its own height
[08:15:46] <seutje> animate something of 100px high to 100px and u won't see much happening
[08:16:16] <eregi> seutje, sure :)
[08:17:20] <eregi> seutje, you solved one of my problems, but on the exact page it's still not working. http://tooth.beberry.lv/trd/team it doesn't get the right height, although it's not set anywhere..
[08:17:27] <hlve> is there any way to declare a function to only fire off if a visitor is in the US?
[08:18:00] <seutje> eregi: there: gotta catch the faux-height, unset it, catch the real height, reset the faux-height, and then animate to the real height -> http://jsfiddle.net/NdL8f/16/
[08:21:44] <eregi> seutje, is that related to that real life example?
[08:22:23] <myrman> I'm building a "Planning Poker" website for an employment test, which means many people need to connect to each other, and I don't know how to do that without using javascript, which is required.
[08:24:51] <seutje> eregi: I don't even know wtf I'm looking for on this page
[08:27:10] <kelye> anyone using ajaxForm plugin ? is there a way to dynamically add data to the form ?
[08:27:53] <eregi> seutje, if you click one one of the images on the right side,a description should appear. It should fade to 0, update contents, and animate opacity to 1 and the new height. In most of the cases the animation of the height bounces - eg, the .content height is determined incorrectly. Try pressing on 1 row 3 colum after the page load, you'll see the #riderinfo div slide up, because of the wrong height, and then suddenly drop down, because the new height is not enoug
[08:28:13] <kelye> i know it has the 'data' option but i have to run a function to get the data i need
[08:30:06] <seutje> eregi: might be cause of the image not being loaded when the height is determined
[08:31:21] <eregi> seutje, was thinking about the same thing, tried adding .load() for the image
[08:32:51] <optraz> pachet: i just want to have two parameters for the function .done()
[08:32:52] <eregi> seutje, now moved the height determination inside the if image loaded statement..
[08:34:34] <seutje> eregi: load is quirky for images
[08:34:37] <seutje> ?imagesloaded
[08:34:37] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[08:35:00] <seutje> anyway, I gotta get going, gl!
[08:37:55] <eregi> seutje, insted of if statement, what should I use, to trigger the animation when image is loaded?
[08:37:58] <eregi> ah ok..

[08:41:33] <hlve> thanks snover <3
[08:41:36] <stewbydoo> gracias
[08:41:51] <hlve> Oh lord. It's back I think
[08:41:58] <stewbydoo> nooo
[08:42:09] <stewbydoo> can anyone help
[08:42:16] <hlve> duc1199, where are you from?
[08:42:20] <hlve> Lowell here ;)
[08:42:28] <hlve> aw. duc1199_ *
[08:42:28] <Spikes> stewbydoo, so, what was the question?
[08:43:18] <stewbydoo> I am trying to get a user to download a file that I save for them on the server. So the file is located at exports/export.svg and I want them to download that file at that location
[08:44:31] <Spikes> Set up a link to that file?
[08:44:48] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of a plugin for chosen for ajax?
[08:45:03] <Forbidd3n> the bootstrap one I found doesn't work correctly
[08:45:20] <_zoggy_> chosen works fine
[08:45:24] <stewbydoo> I guess I could do that but was trying to figure out the most common practice
[08:46:35] <stewbydoo> it actually just redirects me to a page displaying the svg so doesnt actually prompt for download
[08:49:13] <Spikes> stewbydoo, ah, if you're using LAMP then you'd want to tinker with .htaccess to force download of certain files on direct access
[08:49:25] <Spikes> stewbydoo, google ".htaccess force download"
[08:49:37] <saml> how can I test if there's an element with class="yolo" ?
[08:49:43] <saml> $('.yolo').length > 0 ?
[08:50:18] <Spikes> yeah
[08:50:22] <_zoggy_> .hasClass()
[08:50:47] <_zoggy_> http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[08:51:15] <saml> you mean $(document).hasClass() ?
[08:51:24] <stewbydoo> Spikes, that was a good solution but only works for apache, not windows servers
[08:51:27] <Spikes> saml, i don't think it's a good idea
[08:51:57] <Spikes> saml, hasClass check if in certain element there's a class you're looking for, it won't check if there're any elements with that class
[08:53:00] <Spikes> stewbydoo, sorry, don't know much about Windows Servers
[08:53:02] <saml> thanks Spikes
[08:53:11] <stewbydoo> no problem appreciate the help
[09:00:30] <diverdude> whi should i have a return this.each(function() {... in the end of my jquery plugin?
[09:02:11] <Phoenixz> Anybody here who might know something about photoswipe? on http://m.sven.dnsdynamic.com/gallery.html, I have copied the example, but when opening a gallery, I keep seeing the <ul> as a normal <ul> with bullets, showing the images for each <li> after the bullet.. I do not see the example like here: http://www.photoswipe.com/latest/examples/04-jquery-mobile.html#Gallery2
[09:02:46] <Phoenixz> There are no error messages, nothing missing AFAIK, and clicking the images does show the photo slide as it should.. Anybody who might know what is going wrong here?
[09:03:05] <Spikes> diverdude, in order to use that element with other functions: "$('#element').yourPlugin({options}).show();"
[09:03:24] <Spikes> diverdude, there's a term for that, but i don't remember it
[09:05:08] <Spikes> Phoenixz, probably some css missing. You'd have to add css rule ul li {list-style:none;}
[09:05:39] <Spikes> Phoenixz, "ul li {list-style:none;}"
[09:05:41] <Phoenixz> Spikes: Well, I checked with the original.. I seem to have everything.. I'll try adding the rule, lets see what happens
[09:07:25] <Phoenixz> Spikes: Well, bullets are gone iwth that, but it still shows all images on one column.. The example has 4 colums.. I guess I'm missing CSS, but I've loaded the same as in the example..
[09:08:14] <fronixx> How can i check if a newly inserted row in a table equals a row that is about to be inserted? (bad explanation =|) My code: http://pastebin.com/66cNSE1W
[09:08:38] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. anyone have a favorite Jquery plugin for making multiple column text ?
[09:09:51] <ohcibi> i have a form with fieldnames like params[key1], params[key2] etc. how would i create a json hash from it? serializeArray gives me the names but then i'd have to parse them and there could be more dimensions...
[09:10:00] <Spikes> fronixx, not sure if that'd work, but you could compare DOM elements: "$('prevRow')[0] === $('newRow')[0]";
[09:10:28] <fronixx> Hmm okay
[09:10:44] <malinens> hi guys! How to make link with post params with jquery? it should look like link but it should submit _POST params
[09:13:16] <Spikes> malinens, that's very broad. You could set up some data in the link with "data-*" attribute (data-name="foo" data-last="bar"); Then on click event you could retrieve those data via $('link').data(); and just put it in "data" option of ajax call with POST param
[09:13:37] <Spikes> more on ajax: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:14:17] <malinens> oh, I want it to be "simple" link not ajax call- it should open new window
[09:15:10] <Spikes> Oh, i don't think it's possible
[09:15:59] <malinens> yup :/ I will make hidden form and trigger it on link .click event isntead...
[09:17:39] <pachet> !g jquery submit post synchronously site:stackoverflow.com @ malinens
[09:17:40] <b-ot> malinens, jquery - submit post synchronously (not ajax) - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3846271/jquery-submit-post-synchronously-not-ajax
[09:17:50] <pachet> although the 'synchronously' part is a little misleading
[09:30:50] <fronixx> Spikes, Hmm I'm not sure if i did it right http://pastebin.com/zaHCQ5j3
[09:35:09] <optraz> anyone can help? really need help to understanda ajax .done()
[09:35:21] <optraz> i need to pass two parameter in .done()
[09:39:46] <ohcibi> anyone an idea why this regex: /\[([^\[\]]*)(?=\])/ matches [foo in test[foo]?
[09:43:19] <Darian2> Hey, i dont understand why this doesnt work: $.get('http://www.mydomain.at/scrolltext.txt', function(data) { alert("Got get informations!");	});
[09:44:16] <Darian2> but its okay to use $.get to get .txt content?
[09:44:41] <qwebirc83243> What does $(name) means in javascript?
[09:45:44] <pachet> optraz: i'm still not sure what you mean by 'pass 2 parameters'
[09:46:35] <pachet> $.when($.ajax('foo'), $.ajax('bar')).done(function(foo, bar) { /* here 'foo' is the first xhr to foo, 'bar' is the second xhr to bar */ });
[09:46:59] <Darian2> qwebirc83243, this $(name) exists just in jquery and not in javascript...
[09:47:30] <Darian2> qwebirc83243, name is the selector and you can select html tags...
[09:48:45] <pachet> Darian2, qwebirc83243, it could exist in javascript
[09:48:51] <pachet> being that jquery is just javascript :[
[09:49:12] <Darian2> ok, but you know what i mean :-)
[09:49:19] <pachet> qwebirc83243: that's just passing whatever variable is stored in 'name' to the jquery function
[09:49:36] <pachet> qwebirc83243: which will do different things depending on the type of variable passed
[09:50:38] <Darian2> pachet, and why $.get doesnt work an any browser...
[09:50:56] <pachet> "doesn't work" isnt very descriptive
[09:51:12] <pachet> did you try just issuing an $.ajax() call with the type set to plain text/
[09:52:02] <Darian2> pachet, i'll try this ajax stuff
[09:54:10] <ogk1000> are there any tools to help count / navigate to a specific DOM element? I'm using $('#main>table:nth-child(3) tbody tr:nth-child(5) tbody tr:first td').addClass('titlebar'); which works fine... but for some reason on iPad its not counting to the same element... any ideas?
[09:57:42] <ezio> how can i stop a cookie from being sent to the server
[09:57:48] <ezio> ?
[09:58:12] <hlve> that doesn't sound sketchy
[10:00:23] <pachet> that's probably something specific to mobile safari
[10:00:30] <pachet> my advice is to use a cleaner selector :[
[10:05:46] <Drager> Have anyone used jquery tools tooltip?
[10:06:06] <optraz> pachet: i have one ajax call. in the function }).done(function(foo)  { .... });  <== can i have two parameters? because if i did by gving like function(foo, bar) , bar is always success.
[10:16:17] <DobreJoe> Hi, how can I toggle an image on hover so a hidden div is displayed with the same size of the original image?
[10:18:58] <hlve> is there any way to declare a function to only fire off if a visitor is in the US?
[10:27:37] <Gho5t> is there a reason why $('div').keydown(function(e){ console.log(e); }); wouldn't fire? It is within document.ready
[10:28:34] <optraz> maybe div is not exists or keydown never press?
[10:28:45] <Gho5t> no
[10:29:07] <Gho5t> actually here: http://jsfiddle.net/TXZWC/7/
[10:31:53] <jbeach> Gho5t, does a div need focus for keydown to work?
[10:32:11] <jbeach> try $(document), see if the keydown is bubbling up to the top at least
[10:32:22] <Gho5t> I tried it on $('body') too. but let's see
[10:32:43] <jbeach> and if it does, try $(document).on('keydown', 'div', callback)
[10:32:56] <Gho5t> jbeach: yes that works
[10:33:02] <Gho5t> thanks
[10:33:06] <jbeach> see if you can delegate the keydown
[10:33:16] <jbeach> may or may not work
[10:33:17] <Gho5t> using on?
[10:33:24] <Gho5t> not sure what you mean
[10:33:50] <jbeach> $(document).on('keydown', 'div', function (event) { console.log(event)});
[10:35:27] <Gho5t> ok
[10:35:32] <jbeach> did that work?
[10:35:37] <Gho5t> no
[10:35:40] <jbeach> haha
[10:35:42] <Gho5t> but this is fine as is I thinks
[10:35:45] <Gho5t> : )
[10:35:48] <jbeach> coolness
[10:36:00] <Gho5t> how do I map the keypressed to the actual letter that was typed
[10:36:03] <jbeach> just take the 'div' out of that code
[10:36:11] <Gho5t> i'm just getting ints
[10:36:24] <jbeach> yup, the keys are mapped to numbers
[10:36:32] <jbeach> you need to check the number against a map
[10:36:35] <jbeach> there are plugins for this
[10:36:43] <jbeach> or code that's already written
[10:36:46] <jbeach> I'd do some googling
[10:40:47] <jbeach> Gho5t, here's some code you can start with
[10:40:47] <jbeach> https://gist.github.com/66e2665ebf7183b7a89c
[10:46:36] <Gho5t> danke
[10:53:27] <Gho5t> jbeach: String.fromCharCode(e.which) ?
[10:53:33] <Gho5t> is this unreliable?
[10:55:56] <Tom_123> I was thinking about trying to experiment with Jquery (haven't used it much). I wanted to build something that essentially was a dynmaic form with drag/drop etc that basically generated an xml document. I also wanted it to be able to read the xml document. Essentially I want to build a configuration tool that can save/open xml filies with a sexy interface. Are there any guides/tools/resources that would be good for this?
[10:56:01] <Tom_123> is Jquery the right choice?
[10:56:37] <Gho5t> for drag and drop sure
[10:56:38] <firstclassfunc_> what's the easiest way to retrieve some HTML with jquery?
[10:56:43] <Gho5t> for generating an xml file, no
[10:57:05] <Gho5t> firstclassfunc_: $('#foo').html() ?
[10:57:38] <Tom_123> Gho5t, What would I use for the saving/opening of the xml and then how would I go from whatever that was into jquery and then back
[10:58:17] <firstclassfunc_> Gho5t: sorry, didn't specify: I want to load HTML fragments (templates)
[10:58:43] <Gho5t> Tom_123: a server-side language such as PHP or ASP.NET
[10:58:51] <Gho5t> firstclassfunc_: load()
[10:59:22] <pachet> node.js!
[10:59:47] <Gho5t> not very familiar with node.js
[10:59:49] <pachet> you can actually parse xml with javascript, and jquery can be useful for that
[10:59:57] <Gho5t> give me an executive summary plz
[10:59:58] <pachet> but, it's kind of shitty
[11:00:11] <pachet> *on the clientside, i should say
[11:00:20] <firstclassfunc_> Gho5t: I want to do something with that HTML, not just load it using some selector
[11:00:38] <firstclassfunc_> I want to take it, and call my function that compiles the template then pairs it with a model
[11:01:10] <Gho5t> doesn't your templating library handle this
[11:01:17] <Gho5t> are you using one or rolling your own
[11:02:40] <firstclassfunc_> I'm using underscore's template library
[11:08:53] <amadeus1>  so some reason my jquery script isnt running  on http://shouse-solutions.myshopify.com/ the images are supposed to be a slide show but its just stacking them
[11:10:52] <Forbidd3n> Would do this automatically trim the appended value? field.attr('value', val);
[11:12:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I'm using Jquery tabs... Inside each tab I have a link to open a dialog box... the content of this dialog box is generated with php... When I open 1 tab and click that link, it shows the details in a dialog box... but when I then navigate to another tab and click the link, I still get the details from the previous tab in the dialog box...
[11:12:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> any way around this?
[11:14:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> weird thing is: when I set autoOpen to true: it does load the correct data in the dialog
[11:14:38] <arielserafini> amadeus1, it's not running because you don't have jquery loaded
[11:14:45] <Forbidd3n> nvm
[11:16:03] <amadeus1> arielserafini i included the lin "<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5/jquery.min.js"></script>"
[11:17:27] <arielserafini> 1.5?
[11:18:07] <amadeus1> i copy pasted an example
[11:19:05] <amadeus1> and the example functions fine in dreamweaver but not on codr.cc... strange
[11:19:39] <Drager> Have anyone used jquery tools tooltip?
[11:20:14] <Drager> I want to know if I can escape the data with it because now it "fixes" my escaped data and make its unescaped..
[11:20:16] <arielserafini> amadeus1, it's still not loading jquery
[11:20:30] <amadeus1> arielserafini code not working : http://codr.cc/189352 code working http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/basic.html
[11:20:33] <amadeus1> same code
[11:21:48] <arielserafini> amadeus1, you need to add jquery AND the jquery cycle plugin to the page
[11:22:04] <amadeus1> i did
[11:22:21] <arielserafini> amadeus1, http://shouse-solutions.myshopify.com/ ?
[11:22:23] <amadeus1> ill link to to entire page soure
[11:23:37] <amadeus1> arielserafini http://pastebin.com/M5EyDwaw
[11:27:08] <ow1n> Has anyone seen/done a demo showing integration between jQueryUI button and menu?
[11:27:22] <arielserafini> amadeus1, http://jsfiddle.net/J8W8Y/
[11:31:49] <amadeus1> arielserafini ok im not familliar with that setup. i assue i copy the html into the main file and creat a new file for the js or what
[11:32:34] <arielserafini> that was just to show you how i got it to work
[11:32:52] <arielserafini> i added the jquery <script> tag and the cycle plugin <script> tag do the <head>
[11:33:26] <arielserafini> and what's in the "javascript" panel should go either in a separate file, with a separate <script> tag pointing to it
[11:33:36] <arielserafini> or a <script> block
[11:35:03] <amadeus1> what i dont get is that if you look at the full code thing i sent it already has these elements in it
[11:37:01] <arielserafini> amadeus1, yes, that should work
[11:37:06] <arielserafini> but I can't test that
[11:37:09] <arielserafini> so i made a jsfiddle
[11:37:33] <amadeus1> then im confused your saying what i had originally should work
[11:38:23] <konr_trab> How can I scroll to the bottom of the page (or to the footer element)?
[11:43:52] <firstclassfunc_> my ajax call's success function cannot modify variable X, where X is defined outside of the ajax call block.. what can I do so it is in scope?
[11:44:29] <pachet> konr_trab: smoothly? because otherwise you can just assign the footer an id, and then navigate to that id
[11:44:59] <jbeach> Gho5t, no should be reliable: http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
[11:47:30] <pachet> konr_trab: otherwise you can do $('body,html').stop().animate({scrollTop:document.body.scrollHeight});
[11:47:39] <pachet> might be a couple of weird browser gotchas with document.body, but
[11:48:04] <amadeus1> arielserafini i got it it had something to do with where i had added the stuff and in what order i grouped them and moved them and all is good
[11:48:26] <arielserafini> amadeus1, ah, that's great to hear
[11:48:46] <amadeus1> arielserafini thank you for your help and thats a nifty tool for dev
[11:49:17] <arielserafini> amadeus1, you're welcome!
[11:49:22] <arielserafini> oh, jsfiddle?
[11:49:25] <firstclassfunc_> ah, nevermind
[11:49:30] <amadeus1> yea
[11:49:32] <arielserafini> it's very nice indeed
[11:49:40] <arielserafini> you can paste only the relevant html in there
[11:49:51] <arielserafini> doesn't have to be the whole page
[11:50:02] <arielserafini> it makes it easy for people to help you
[11:50:34] <amadeus1> so i saw would allow me to play with other templates and things before buying them to see how things go
[11:53:38] <walidvb> hi guys, this isn't really the right place, but maybe someone can point me to the right channel or give me a hand. I am trying to use officialfm player, by sending an ajax request to their server, and getting the embed code back. somehow it works just fine on chrome, but not on firefox.
[11:53:58] <walidvb> i'm not even sure it's my fault, actually..
[11:54:04] <walidvb> here is the frame I embed: http://official.fm/player?skin_bg=E1DCCD&amp;skin_fg=A03B3B&amp;width=210&amp;height=40&amp;feed=http%3A%2F%2Fofficial.fm%2F%2Ffeed%2Fplaylists%2FXWbl
[11:56:27] <walidvb> on firefox, i get a HTTP 406 error. however, accept headers is text/html, and response content-type is text/html
[11:56:36] <walidvb> i am kind of lost here..
[11:59:00] <BFranks> How would I get a 100% local (zero WAN access) copy of ThemeRoller?
[12:03:15] <LordVorp> walidvb: I sure hope that what you pasted as "&amp;" in the channel is actually "&" in your link
[12:04:02] <LordVorp> walidvb: otherwise, fix that first then come back if it's still broken
[12:06:46] <walidvb> LordVorp: hm that is the code that is returned by official.fm, but let me check that
[12:07:43] <walidvb> so.. this loads the same error
[12:07:45] <walidvb> http://official.fm/player?skin_bg=E1DCCD&skin_fg=A03B3B&width=210&height=40&feed=http%3A%2F%2Fofficial.fm%2F%2Ffeed%2Fplaylists%2FXWbl
[12:09:05] <ericw> damn i need to add this channel to my auto join
[12:09:19] <walidvb> i really try to do it the way they want. they had a js earlier, which allowed you to OfficialFM.create(trackID), but it doesn't support the new track ids, and it's not documented. new api doc only has json responses, so I switched to that, but ff stopped working
[12:09:38] <walidvb> LordVorp: I get the embed code from http://api.official.fm/playlists/XWbl?fields=embed&api_version=2&api_key=eUdwKFeEUFrKsCvEnxNRALRZJX6ELUof
[12:14:17] <ericw> <script language="javascript">
[12:14:17] <ericw> $window.onload = function(){
[12:14:24] <ericw> is that correct?
[12:20:10] <arielserafini> ericw, assuming $window is equal to $("window"), you should use $window.load(function(){    });
[12:21:00] <arielserafini> ericw, er, $(window), no quotes
[12:21:04] <arielserafini> my bad :/
[12:21:39] <ericw> ok i'll give that a try
[12:22:11] <ericw> any tricks to making my jquery load faster? lol
[12:22:35] <ericw> i'm trying to replace background images with jquery (it's necessary, trust me) but theres a second lag in chrome
[12:22:56] <Lucky--> I have a complex object as my viewModel (myObject, myObject.Form1.Property, myObject.Form2.Property, etc. With an observer framework is it better to bind the whole complex object or each subset? what are the pros/cons of each?
[12:24:43] <arielserafini> ericw, I don't know about your setup, but you could use $(document).ready instead and change classes on the elements
[12:24:51] <arielserafini> that would be faster than waiting for window.load
[12:25:24] <Lucky--> ericw: make sure your js is loading right before the closing body tag. not in the head
[12:25:39] <walidvb> Lucky--: what difference does that make?
[12:25:59] <ericw> yeah the on load is slow
[12:26:02] <ericw> that's not going to work. lol
[12:26:56] <ericw> $(document).ready is about as slow as on load
[12:28:29] <arielserafini> ericw, window.load waits for images to load, so it's slower
[12:28:43] <arielserafini> document.ready fires when the DOM is ready for manipulation
[12:29:38] <ericw> and what about none of that?
[12:29:41] <ericw> just (function
[12:30:23] <ericw> hmm
[12:30:47] <ericw> $(function(){  seems to be the fastest of all
[12:32:04] <arielserafini> ericw, that's equivalent to $(document).ready
[12:32:27] <ericw> ah ok
[12:34:30] <ericw> any other way to make it load faster?
[12:35:43] <ericw> does it make a difference to have it in the body of your code or linked to in a js file???
[12:35:49] <pachet> put your script before </body>
[12:36:00] <pachet> ericw: that depends on several things
[12:36:07] <ericw> currently my scripts are in the head
[12:36:43] <ericw> i haven't tried placing them in a js file because i thought that it'd be quicker to have them in the head
[12:36:49] <Flam> If you need JS to load before your HTML, put it in the head (very rare)
[12:37:15] <ericw> i need it to load after my html actually but before the page renders. lol
[12:38:09] <Flam> then put it in head
[12:39:57] <windsurf_> I'm animating a div left but something else is stopping it from completing. What could do this? I've seen stop() and clearQueue() anything else?
[12:40:20] <windsurf_> my div slides left part way then stops and its complete handler doesn't fire
[12:44:03] <diverdude> I have made this fiddle with 2 maps: http://jsfiddle.net/ujhYy/ which has a problem. Its a bit complex because i cannot figure out how to isolate the error, so i hope somebody can help me out. The problem is that if the top map is clicked some random place, a marker appears at the clickposition. This marker has an event attached which is fired. The problem is that the wrong handler is invoked. The console.log reveals that it is the handler conta
[12:44:03] <diverdude> ining the f2 variable which is invoked and not the one containing the f1 variable which it should be. Why is the wrong handler invoked?
[12:47:15] <LessSeen> there is a weird div closing tag
[12:47:25] <LessSeen> not sure if thats related..
[12:49:09] <xckpd7> is there a pure javascript equivalent of extending an object?
[12:51:20] <gnarf> xckpd7: see ?101
[12:51:20] <bot-t> xckpd7, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[12:51:36] <gnarf> xckpd7: what exactly do you mean by "extending an object"
[12:53:01] <xckpd7> gnarf: $.extend
[12:53:29] <gnarf> xckpd7: I would suggest looking at how lodash.js implements extend
[12:53:40] <gnarf> xckpd7: but - its pretty simple
[12:53:57] <diverdude> gnarf: do you have a minute :)

[12:54:04] <ericw> look at how slow the background changes. :(
[12:54:30] <eregi> Any ideas how to determine the correct height of the .test? the image inside of it is messing everything up..
[12:55:00] <gnarf> xckpd7: basically its a for loop over every argument after the first, that loops over every key of that object, checks hasOwnProperty and assigns the value to the same key on arguments[0]
[12:55:14] <ericw> hmm maybe if i put my jquery directly into the index.html file
[12:55:18] <ericw> instead of including it
[12:55:41] <ericw> currently it's included in the body of my header file
[12:56:19] <eregi> here's the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/beberry/NdL8f/18/
[12:56:37] <gnarf> xckpd7: pseudocoded - for each object in arguments[1..]: for each key in object: if object.hasOwnProperty(key): arguments[0][key] = object[key]
[12:56:51] <gnarf> ?ask @diverdude
[12:56:52] <bot-t> diverdude, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:58:23] <xckpd7> gnarf: makes sense, thanks
[12:59:56] <gnarf> xckpd7: here's some implementations I wrote a while back https://gist.github.com/d92ec4c4fbda5d819fc0
[13:00:25] <xckpd7> gnarf: what's the verdict on lodash? better than underscore?
[13:00:44] <gnarf> xckpd7: lodash passes underscores unit tests, and is generally faster
[13:00:47] <gnarf> also
[13:01:00] <gnarf> I like jdalton's style :)
[13:01:40] <gnarf> tbh - i consider lodash / underscore to be a standard include on most anything I write anymore
[13:01:56] <gnarf> xckpd7: that code in that gist was for some very specific use cases
[13:02:12] <gnarf> the object.length check is probably pretty weak
[13:02:39] <walidvb> can someone explain to me how to fix the fact that this works in chrome and not firefox? http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/rK2VR/
[13:03:10] <ericw> i'm giving up on this
[13:03:18] <ericw> this website is all hacked and duct taped together
[13:03:43] <ericw> it's good enough for now i suppose
[13:03:51] <gnarf> walidvb: is that a jsonp api?
[13:04:02] <walidvb> json, i think
[13:04:21] <ericw> i owe BV Wines and Sterling Vineyards a drupal block so i need to focus on that
[13:04:36] <ziz> hey whats a simple jquery that will put visability 0 on an emement and fade to 100 on hover?
[13:04:42] <ziz> I'm sure its obvious but I'm new
[13:04:58] <walidvb> ziz: css3
[13:05:00] <walidvb> :)
[13:05:02] <ak> hey, is there any way to tell how long exactly some animation will take in jquery? :)
[13:05:30] <ericw> to develop?
[13:05:35] <ziz> walidvb what should I search?
[13:05:36] <ziz> and thanks
[13:05:36] <ericw> or load?
[13:05:41] <ericw> ak:
[13:05:56] <ak> ericw: to play...
[13:06:08] <walidvb> or $('.foo').each($(this).hide().hover(function(){$(this).fadeToggle()});. but i would defo go via css3
[13:06:22] <ericw> are you trying to make it play faster? lol
[13:06:57] <ak> like $().animate({things...}, 5000)   < this is a bit less then 5000ms ...
[13:06:59] <walidvb> ziz: well, smth like .foo{opacity: 0, transition: all 1s}, .foo:hover{opacity: 1}. btw, i assume you meant by visibility opacity
[13:07:07] <ak> in my case...
[13:07:27] <ericw> ah yeah, stack overflow or google will help you with that
[13:07:36] <ericw> stackoverflow is pretty quick with the help
[13:07:58] <ericw> it took me longer to register. ;)
[13:08:31] <ziz> walidvb yeah I did
[13:08:50] <ziz> transition: all 1s; hmm never heard of that
[13:09:46] <walidvb> ziz: look it up, css3 has a lot of awsome new stuff
[13:09:54] <xckpd7> gnarf: you put me on the right track (i'm using the extend code from jQuery source): thanks very much
[13:10:08] <walidvb> such as transition between states, easing, animation, keyframes, and 3d transforms, much much more
[13:10:17] <xckpd7> gnarf: and I'm going to use lodash in my other project
[13:12:59] <walidvb> ziz and you need to add prefixes, like -moz -o -webkit
[13:13:33] <gnarf> xckpd7: lodash is so nice
[13:13:52] <gnarf> xckpd7: once you start to grok all the functional utilities
[13:14:00] <ziz> walidvb thanks got it
[13:17:53] <eregi> Any ideas how to determine the correct height of the .test? the image inside of it is messing everything up.. http://jsfiddle.net/beberry/NdL8f/18/
[13:20:34] <arielserafini> eregi, it looks like it IS getting the correct height
[13:20:52] <arielserafini> which is 72px
[13:21:04] <arielserafini> you want that to include the image?
[13:21:30] <eregi> arielserafini, yes, the image ofcourse, because it's a part of that div
[13:21:47] <gnarf> eregi: see ?imagesLoaded
[13:21:48] <bot-t> eregi, imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[13:22:01] <gnarf> eregi: images don't have height until they are loaded
[13:22:33] <callumacrae> preg > eregi
[13:22:39] <callumacrae> sorry
[13:24:54] <peterschmidler> How can I access a received json object from outside an $ajax function?
[13:25:18] <arielserafini> eregi, I assume you don't know the image dimensions before it loads?
[13:25:51] <eregi> arielserafini, no I don't
[13:31:35] <arielserafini> eregi, is this acceptable? http://jsfiddle.net/NdL8f/19/
[13:35:55] <JGAui> hey, just released a site and cli tool to make custom jquery builds a little easier: http://projects.jga.me/jquery-builder/  let me know if you guys have any feedback
[13:36:19] <gnarf> eregi: http://jsfiddle.net/NdL8f/21/ -- imagesLoaded............
[13:36:37] <gnarf> arielserafini: disable cache and its still broken
[13:42:14] <ericw> what do you guys use to test a website for javascript errors???
[13:42:52] <ak> ericw: just take a look az chrome console
[13:43:03] <ak> maybe jslint/jshint
[13:43:12] <ericw> any firefox addons?
[13:43:20] <ericw> that you'd recommend
[13:43:20] <ericw> lol
[13:43:41] <ericw> i think if i start fixing javascript errors from the previous developers, that'd speed up my jquery by a lot
[13:43:43] <peterschmidler> How can I add a short pause between every rloop of an each function?
[13:44:52] <ak> peterschmidler: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5202403/how-to-add-pause-between-each-iteration-of-jquery-each
[13:45:04] <peterschmidler> ak: thx
[13:45:47] <eregi> arielserafini, thanks, thal looks nice, just can't notice how did you achieve that.
[13:46:14] <arielserafini> eregi, i removed the inline height in your appended element
[13:46:24] <arielserafini> but gnarf said it doesn't work with cache disabled
[13:46:31] <eregi> gnarf, thank you! :) So the arielserafini example won't work with images that aren't cached?
[13:46:38] <gnarf> eregi: correct
[13:47:35] <eregi> Ok, Hudge thanks to both of you :) took ~ 1.5 days to find why the height wasn't correct, and then spent some time searching for the solution, Again thank you~ :)
[13:47:44] <gnarf> eregi: images don't have height until they are loaded
[13:49:03] <LordVorp> unless, of course, the img tag has a height attribute...
[14:15:34] <invisib> What's the diff between scrollorama and slidedeck? Also, is there a faster plugin that does the same stuff?
[14:15:49] <invisib> I basically just want to do tiny/subtle animations as people scroll.
[14:22:10] <Guest18810> so I've got a standard navbar I use on every page on my site with a checkbox in it.. however.. on one page its getting caught by a class selector (I'm assuming) and being turned into a jquery ui button.. Is there a way for me to select that object and "unbutton" it?
[15:08:33] <lige> exit
[15:13:44] <DobreJoe> When the mouse hovers over an image how can I sustitute
[15:14:01] <DobreJoe> sorry, substitute the image for a div with the same dimensions?
[15:24:25] <dogarrhea2> practical question.  So people have popupblockers and what not.  Is there some way to ask for permission to do a popup even if they have popup blockers enabled, so you can disable the setting or popup anyways?
[15:29:59] <shoelessone> Does anybody know if there is a great way to basically take the ajax lodaing component of jQuery Mobile and use it for a non-mobile site?
[15:30:15] <shoelessone> I don't need the whole page paradim, just back button support in the browser
[15:30:37] <dogarrhea2> i'm pretty sure that since it's on the client, the popupblocker can do whatever it wants and prevent popups even after permission.
[15:33:02] <dogarrhea2> could even have an operating system level popup blocker that suppresses OS windows creation stuff
[15:33:42] <dogarrhea2> since that is out of the way, what's the usual way to do a "please let me popup" thing?
[15:50:01] <haizum> http://jsfiddle.net/sf6pg/
[15:50:06] <haizum> im trying to .animate the width of a div
[15:50:09] <haizum> can't get it to work
[15:50:13] <haizum> not sure what i'm doing wrong
[15:51:27] <LesF> Hi, can anyone tell me why I am not able to access the jquery API using IE9?  The links end in a slash, e.g. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/ and IE asks me if I want to open or save, but never recognizes any actual page content.
[15:54:07] <brightsites> what am I doing wrong to get the media:content item of an rss feed? test:$(v).find('media\\:content').attr('url'),
[15:56:12] <Carlitta> hi everyone. having a big problem... myslideshow won't work on certain pages of a site im working on. I was wondering if anyone could assist me. I believe it maybe due to where the file is coming from that is throwing of the slideshow. heres a link: http://www.remax-elite.com.jm/nmcms.php?snippet=properties&p=viewpropertydetails&pid=10992&pic=1&mls=3401
[15:56:54] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:56:55] <ryanneufeld> LesF: you're not working with a HTML DOM so your results may not be as expected
[15:57:00] <ryanneufeld> LesF: see here as well http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix
[15:57:11] <ryanneufeld> Derp LesF that was meant for brightsites
[15:57:18] <ryanneufeld> brightsites: you're not working with a HTML DOM so your results may not be as expected
[15:57:26] <ryanneufeld> brightsites: see here as well http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix
[15:58:11] <ryanneufeld> Carlitta: did you see the
[15:58:12] <ryanneufeld> [cycle] terminating; zero elements found by selector
[15:58:25] <ryanneufeld> message in the console?
[15:58:30] <LesF> Sorry?  I am trying to use the API documentation on the jquery web site, but cannot navigate by clicking on the links provided
[15:58:42] <Carlitta> ryanneufeld: no i didnt
[15:58:50] <brightsites> ryanneufeld: so custom selectors won't work?
[15:59:09] <ryanneufeld> brightsites: you're using it on XML DOM, not HTML DOM
[15:59:13] <ryanneufeld> Carlitta: jquery.cycle.all.js:28
[15:59:43] <brightsites> ryanneufeld: so have to use plain js?
[15:59:58] <ryanneufeld> dunno
[16:07:01] <haizum> wtf, i have a div with a .hover event and an alert inside of it and its not triggering it when i mouseover
[16:07:27] <haizum> what would cause it to not work?
[16:07:44] <haizum> http://jsfiddle.net/sf6pg/1/
[16:10:03] <rmurphey> haizum: can you demonstrate it not working? i.e. add some html to the fiddle
[16:11:39] <rmurphey> haizum: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/STjYG/
[16:11:41] <rmurphey> seems to work for me
[16:16:02] <haizum> http://jsfiddle.net/sf6pg/2/
[16:16:06] <haizum> ok so it works on jsfiddle
[16:16:28] <haizum> so for some reason the div on my page isn't triggering the hover event for some reason
[16:16:33] <haizum> i checked the z-index, and its def. on top
[16:48:12] <codeshah> hi, how do I trigger an action every time a div becomes visible… ?
[16:51:48] <chad3814> so is there a way to get an event fired when an element is added or removed from the dom?
[16:52:31] <chad3814> eg, I have a jquery fragment that isn't immediately added
[17:01:04] <Biomech> can anyone point me in the direction of code/script that I can use for a FAQ. I want to show/hide the answer when clicking the question BUT I want the previous answer to hide when a new question is clicked on
[17:01:55] <blindMoe> Biomech: doubt you would need a script.. that is maybe two lines of jquery
[17:02:09] <Biomech> yeah but i suck at js/jquery so i dont know what the 2 lines are ;)
[17:02:58] <Biomech> all the examples i can find are just toggle on clicks, they dont hide the previous
[17:02:58] <blindMoe> just look up Accordion
[17:03:10] <blindMoe> hiding the others should be fairly simple
[17:03:50] <Biomech> ah yeah ok...
[17:04:32] <blindMoe> Biomech: basics of it are:  Someone clicks the link, all items are hidden, just the one they clicked is then opened
[17:04:41] <Biomech> ah i see
[17:04:44] <Biomech> makes sense
[17:04:45] <blindMoe> if you want to go further check to see if it is already opened and don't do anything
[17:04:55] <blindMoe> otherwise when they click on it, it will hide and reopen itself
[17:05:09] <Biomech> once i get all of this work out of the way ill sit down and learn jq properly :)
[17:05:28] <blindMoe> well if you do this correctly, it will have taught you some jQuery in the process
[17:06:17] <Biomech> :D
[17:19:57] <dsdsadas> Can I do jsonp if the returned data is wrapped in html and body tags?
[17:20:36] <blindMoe> json responses are expected to be solely json
[17:20:43] <Ai__> hey guys is there anything wrong with this function http://pastebin.com/9jS3sFaL
[17:20:49] <blindMoe> dsdsadas: you could pull the json out of an element and then use it though
[17:21:04] <dsdsadas> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP#Padding this says something about how it can be a variable assignment, though
[17:21:21] <dsdsadas> How would I pull it out of an element?
[17:31:50] <Ai_> sorry is there something wrong with this function http://pastebin.com/PgcEvf2S
[17:32:27] <coldhead> i don't like the font
[17:32:44] <coldhead> woah, deja vu
[17:32:50] <dsdsadas> Is it a Serif?
[17:36:29] <rmurphey> serious deja vu
[17:40:36] <rmurphey> Ai_: here is a slightly adapted version that seems to work just fine http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/DVUkZ/
[17:42:09] <jackp10> hi to everyone
[17:42:30] <Ai_> rmurphey:  thanks so much.. my question is if that will work even if i need to bring content ("form") from an external page
[17:42:57] <jackp10> Can someone explain something to me…. I have the index page with a button.
[17:43:12] <jackp10> when I click the button, it opens a new tab (Jquery UI Tab) with dynamic content
[17:43:30] <rmurphey> Ai_: not if you set it up before you add the form to the page, no
[17:43:39] <jackp10> inside this new page there is a list having a button each that print an alert at the moment
[17:44:16] <jackp10> there is a .live click event on the button in the index page
[17:44:27] <Ai_> rmurphey:  yes cux actually i need to bring up the page first and then submit.. so what im suppose to change there?
[17:44:34] <jackp10> the problem i have is that when i click the first time, the tab opens correctly and the alert on the second page works
[17:44:49] <rmurphey> Ai_: you would need to bind the submit handler after you add the form
[17:44:54] <rmurphey> or else you would need to use event delegation
[17:45:03] <jackp10> if I close the tab, and then click that button again in the index page, everything wokds ok a part that the alert appear twice
[17:45:22] <jackp10> if I do the process again without refreshing the page, the alert will display 3 times and so forth
[17:45:31] <jackp10> i dont know what is causing this issue
[17:46:18] <Ai_> well its kinda confuse =/
[17:48:31] <jackp10> any idea ?
[17:54:50] <Biomech> ok im guessing this is a now, but is it possible to have link point to a faq entry that's hidden, but open it when the link is clicked (thats on another page) ... ie "Please see reference 1.2 in the faq"
[17:54:58] <Biomech> s/now/no
[17:55:12] <Biomech> the faq being jquery show/hide
[17:55:24] <Biomech> toggle even
[18:31:38] <goddard> im using the default style and just the example open dialog link but when I put it in my page the dialog link box is broken
[18:31:39] <bot-t> (858 hours ago) <coldhead> tell goddard I will never forget you
[18:34:35] <lindii_> hi.. i need to bring content from a different page and then submit it.. is there something wrong in this code http://pastebin.com/9fjAiqsV
[18:42:13] <DobreJoe> Hi. I have an image and a hidden div. When the mouse hovers on the image I'd like to hide the image and show the hidden div. Since I don't know beforehand the height of the image I get it using .css('height'); My problem is that my selector affects all the other images. How can I get a more specific behavior? http://jsfiddle.net/V58Gh/
[18:51:27] <ezio> twitter room is dead
[18:51:31] <ezio> so i'm asking this here
[18:51:36] <ezio> is bootstrap made with em?
[18:51:39] <ezio> or percent
[18:51:40] <ezio> or both
[18:51:53] <ezio> i seem to remember it's emless
[18:52:56] <astropirate> its made with fairy dust
[18:54:47] <tw2113> and unicorn farts
[18:57:21] <ezio> it's also the same substance that's filmy on my balls that i wipe on your face when i'm sleeping
[18:57:41] <ezio> you're sleeping
[19:00:26] <coldhead> well that went downhill quickly
[19:00:32] <coldhead> good work everyone, take five
[19:07:30] <rmurphey> DobreJoe: you should find the .specifications element you want relative to the image
[19:07:44] <rmurphey> or rather, relative to the container that's being moused over
[19:07:57] <rmurphey> so instead of just $('.specificaton's)
[19:08:07] <rmurphey> you should do $(this).find('.specifications')
[19:08:24] <DobreJoe> rmurphey: I see. Will try that. Thanks so much.
[19:08:24] <rmurphey> and that will only deal with the div that's inside the container that was mouse'd over
[19:08:29] <DobreJoe> great
[19:08:45] <rmurphey> you may also want to check out .hover()
[19:10:54] <DobreJoe> rmurphey: I know there are subtle differences between hover and mouse enter but really don't know when to choose one or the other.
[19:12:37] <rmurphey> i guess i will not tell dobrejoe that hover is just an alias for mouseenter/mouseleave
[19:12:40] <rmurphey> ohwell
[19:13:21] <McCuz> btw does anyone know how much of html5 does nightly support?
[19:13:50] <McCuz> a few years back I expected to have to do everything seperate for IE, but now with html5 i didnt expect firefox to fall behind this much >_<
[19:14:10] <McCuz> i think I'll just drop 5 altogether
[19:14:15] <McCuz> for no
[19:14:16] <McCuz> now*
[19:17:26] <DobreJoe> rmurphey: thanks, everything works now as expected.
[19:17:58] <rmurphey> DobreJoe: btw, hover is just an alias for mouseenter/mouseleave
[19:20:31] <DobreJoe> rmurphey: Ok, now I understand some of the 'chaining'with .hover that I have been seeing.
[19:21:43] <rmurphey> DobreJoe: see http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js and search for hover:
[19:22:57] <DobreJoe> rmurphey: exact, it's an alias: events.replace( rhoverHack, "mouseenter$1 mouseleave$1" );
[19:23:13] <rmurphey> hm, no
[19:23:19] <rmurphey> search for 'hover:'
[19:23:26] <rmurphey> 	hover: function( fnOver, fnOut ) {
[19:23:26] <rmurphey> 		return this.mouseenter( fnOver ).mouseleave( fnOut || fnOver );
[19:23:27] <rmurphey> 	}
[19:23:40] <DobreJoe> ahhh, i see

[21:31:21] <coldhead> what's the line
[21:31:50] <chovy> coldhead, jsut add this: 108.194.42.92 foobar.spring
[21:31:58] <chovy> and then goto http://foobar.spring:8080
[21:32:39] <coldhead> Welcome to Foobar.com
[21:32:45] <chovy> ok. cool
[21:32:47] <chovy> thanks
[21:32:56] <coldhead> u r welcome
[21:39:21] <ringo_> mfoxdogg|work: there's no jquery command that automatically does that. you have to write a function to do that
[21:39:22] <disappearedng> Is it possible to access cookie set by a 3rd party server accessed via JSONP?
[21:40:05] <coldhead> does anyone have any questions they weren't asking yesterday? hit me back, yo
[21:40:27] <astropirate> disappearedng, if... for some ODD reason they are settign the cookie when you are requesting the resource
[21:41:51] <disappearedng> well I am building an analytics service and my clients make a JSONP to my server. My server sets the cookie and now I want to access that cookie in their browser's environment
[21:42:20] <astropirate> disappearedng, well no sorry
[21:42:22] <astropirate> you cant
[21:42:26] <astropirate> because its set by a diffrent domain
[21:42:38] <beachandbytes> depends
[21:42:46] <disappearedng> hm so it looks like I have to return the ID in the analytics call then
[21:42:58] <astropirate> beachandbytes, please go on
[21:44:03] <disappearedng> http://pastie.org/4744721 this is what I am doing
[21:44:09] <coldhead> i still think you could do it by having the remote domain re-serve the cookies in its response
[21:44:14] <beachandbytes> most browsers have settings for 3rd party cookies
[21:45:20] <disappearedng> beachandbytes: and how would I access that?
[21:45:53] <coldhead> very carefully
[21:46:30] <disappearedng> coldhead: do you have any web pages to recommend?
[21:48:04] <coldhead> i am quite fond of http://bit.ly/NSZb4F
[21:48:07] <beachandbytes> disappearedng request the cookie by name
[21:48:33] <beachandbytes> but in most modern browsers you will get denied
[21:48:40] <disappearedng> coldhead: haha real funny
[21:48:53] <disappearedng> beachandbytes: yeah I guess I just have to return the cookie in the response
[21:50:31] <coldhead> http://www.ravelrumba.com/blog/third-party-cookies/
[22:00:19] <newcode> is there a way to display the progress of an image loading from the server into the browser?
[22:00:49] <Cork> no
[22:01:13] <Cork> you could split the image up into parts and use that for progress
[22:01:18] <Cork> but... not really
[22:04:37] <Lucky--> ROFL: i go to view the source of this site, and this is what it is: https://dl.dropbox.com/0/view/q2l0l4c6f85gpyw/Apps/CloudShot/shot_9172012_100846_pm.jpeg\
[22:05:33] <newcode> Cork: so I can only track when an image is fully loaded?
[22:05:40] <Cork> yes
[22:05:40] <newcode> no progress?
[22:05:53] <newcode> ok...
[22:05:56] <newcode> thanks
[22:06:20] <disappearedng> hey if I do a JSONP with $.ajax and I return {"user_id":1} how come I get Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : ? I am seeing Chrome treating the response like a script
[22:06:49] <Cork> disappearedng: you don't
[22:07:10] <Cork> that error is a parser error and might come from earlier in the code
[22:07:41] <Cork> the reason that line might show it, is cause the engin is able to recover until you add that line
[22:08:37] <disappearedng> Cork: what? I did a JSONP to my service and it literally treated my response like a <script> itself (well considering JSONP is basically a hack around script tags I wouldn't be surprised). My problem is I can't access the data return from the JSONP because it's "parseerror"
[22:09:15] <Cork> disappearedng: but not cause of that line
[22:09:21] <Cork> {"user_id":1} is valid json
[22:09:37] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{"user_id":1}')
[22:09:40] <disappearedng> but in valid javascript
[22:09:41] <bot-t> Cork: {"user_id": 1}
[22:09:53] <Cork> json is valid javascript
[22:10:00] <Cork> json is a subset of javascript
[22:10:20] <disappearedng> yeah well in chrome I am seeing https://gist.github.com/307b55662f272565b2c4
[22:10:26] <Cork> ?eval (function() { return {"user_id":1}; })()
[22:10:27] <bot-t> Cork: {"user_id": 1}
[22:10:57] <Cork> disappearedng: is {"user_id": 1} what your returning?
[22:11:02] <Cork> if so then ya
[22:11:08] <disappearedng> yes
[22:11:17] <Cork> if your responding to a jsonp request then you need to respond with javascript
[22:12:02] <newcode> Cork: what do you think of that? http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/files/XHRProgressSample.html?file=XHRProgressSample.html
[22:12:11] <Cork> disappearedng: function <?php echo $_GET['callback'] ?>() { return {"user_id": 1}; }
[22:12:13] <disappearedng> Cork: ok thanks for the tips I need to read up
[22:12:16] <Cork> kinda
[22:12:16] <disappearedng> I am using Flask
[22:12:40] <Cork> (that code is broken i know, but hopefully you get the idea)
[22:15:51] <Cork> newcode: ugg i would say its an horrible idea
[22:16:06] <newcode> Cork: why :)
[22:16:24] <Cork> newcode: they fetch the image base64 encoded over xhr, and then "loads" the data as a data-uri
[22:16:48] <Cork> base64 enlarges the image with about 40%
[22:16:56] <Cork> (its data size that is)
[22:17:29] <newcode> so 40% more bandwidth used
[22:17:35] <Cork> oh wait no
[22:17:46] <Cork> it actually loads the image in raw format
[22:17:54] <Cork> and... encodes it in js >_<'
[22:18:09] <Cork> that makes it better, but i still think its a horrible idea
[22:18:21] <newcode> this is the original blog post
[22:18:22] <newcode> http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2012/01/13/html5-image-progress-events/
[22:19:32] <danheberden> Cork: google does that actually
[22:19:47] <danheberden> they found the speed of sending base64 gzipped was faster than encoded images
[22:19:52] <Cork> just cause google does it doesn't mean its a good idea
[22:19:53] <danheberden> because they had to send chunks instead of whole iamges
[22:19:55] <danheberden> due to IE
[22:20:12] <Cork> danheberden: this isn't base64 encoded
[22:20:34] <danheberden> "newcode: they fetch the image base64 encoded over xhr, and then "loads" the data as a data-uri" i must have misunderstood
[22:20:35] <Cork> they'r sending the image over xhr and encodes the received data in js
[22:21:00] <Cork> its still an encoded image on the other end
[22:21:01] <catery> how do i handle ajax response with jquery, suppose the response from the server is json, and on the client i do $('.delete_post').bind('ajax:success', function() {       $(this).closest('tr').fadeOut();   }); ,       what do i do to handle the json response though?
[22:21:05] <newcode> Cork: yep
[22:21:18] <Cork> danheberden: loading the image like that will make the browser use a lot more memory
[22:21:28] <newcode> so big performance hit right?
[22:21:33] <Cork> depends
[22:21:38] <Cork> one image doesn't really matters
[22:21:45] <Cork> if its many yes it matters
[22:21:51] <danheberden> less than 250k worth of images? just load the image
[22:21:58] <danheberden> here's more info re: google's approach: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4145205/what-advantages-are-there-for-google-to-send-images-as-base64-rather-than-e-g-j
[22:22:02] <newcode> Cork: I want to do it for some sort of slideshow
[22:22:08] <Cork> then i wouldn't
[22:22:13] <danheberden> but honestly, go for images if it's not hundreds of images
[22:22:20] <danheberden> more work to base64 encode
[22:22:27] <danheberden> and decode - like YOUR work, not the browser
[22:22:49] <danheberden> plus a slide show you have X seconds to load the next one
[22:23:07] <danheberden> (didn't mean to hijack the answer Cork - just wanted to share the google stuff for comparison)
[22:23:13] <Cork> the browser has to get the raw string (store that), encode that, (store that, plus the work), generate the data-uri, and then denerate the image with the data-uri
[22:23:22] <Cork> thhen decode the base64 string again
[22:23:37] <Cork> and finnaly decode the image to its raw format (pixel data)
[22:24:53] <Cork> for a slide show a better option is to preload your image
[22:25:13] <Cork> so its downloaded and local when you want to render it
[22:25:17] <newcode> well, we have a slideshow in flash that does really nice image loading progress, we want to re-create that on HTML5
[22:25:34] <newcode> unless it's a big performance hit
[22:26:03] <Cork> if its written correctly it will "just" cause the gc to do a lot of work
[22:26:14] <newcode> gc?
[22:26:16] <Cork> if it makes a mistake, your page will eat memory
[22:26:21] <Cork> Gabage Collection
[22:26:31] <Cork> its what cleans up unused memory
[22:26:34] <newcode> interesting
[22:27:06] <Cork> everytime you modify a string, the old string with the modification is copied to a new memory section
[22:27:10] <Cork> and the old string is garbage
[22:27:35] <Cork> at interval a process seeks through all pointers and finds sections thats not in use
[22:27:39] <Cork> and clears it
[22:27:50] <newcode> so browser would work more?
[22:27:53] <Cork> if you generate a lot of garbage you get gc freezes
[22:27:57] <Cork> yes
[22:28:25] <newcode> we can go up to 50 images by slideshow - what do you think, risky?
[22:29:04] <Cork> depends more on the size of the images
[22:29:31] <Cork> if you need to have a loading progress bar, that prob means they'r quite big, and then yes
[22:29:42] <Cork> if not, i don't see why you need the loading screen at all
[22:29:49] <coldhead> who are the people who are recommend extjs?
[22:30:04] <coldhead> people keep telling me that everyone is recommending it
[22:30:10] <Cork> coldhead: my boss -_-'
[22:30:10] <coldhead> WHERE IS THIS ELUSIVE EVERYONE
[22:30:22] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, Cork's boss
[22:30:23] <Cork> i hate it, but...
[22:30:26] <Cork> lol
[22:30:32] <newcode> coldhead: I've liked Extjs for the little I used it
[22:30:45] <coldhead> are you recommending it to people?
[22:30:52] <Cork> i used it and tried HARD to get it to do what i want, but its so freeking rigid
[22:30:59] <coldhead> and saying it's the "only choice" for JS frameworks?
[22:31:03] <coldhead> because that's what i'm told
[22:31:27] <Cork> coldhead: from what i heard its mostly cause if its ui designer
[22:31:44] <newcode> coldhead: I've used sencha touch, and sticked to what it offered out the box - that was fine
[22:32:06] <Cork> you can design extjs almost like you make(made) vb applications
[22:32:09] <coldhead> this is valuable insight, thank you both
[22:32:45] <Cork> i wish jquery had something similar then i wouldn't get extjs shoved down my trout >_>
[22:33:13] <coldhead> jQextJS?
[22:33:20] <coldhead> note to self: let someone else do that
[22:33:28] <Cork> extjs is nice as long as you don't need to step outside what they've throught of before
[22:33:30] <newcode> I've heard of backbones but I don't know if it's any good
[22:33:49] <Cork> as soon as you need to make something do something that doesn't fitt there mold, your screwed
[22:34:22] <Cork> *thought
[22:34:47] <coldhead> they're different domains really, newcode
[22:35:14] <coldhead> backbone is one of those MVC things the kids love, with data synchronisation with the server
[22:35:53] <coldhead> as opposed to a windowy abortion
[22:36:16] <astropirate> I was making something like jQextJS but then saw this. Good, let them validate ... rather invalidate the idea
[22:36:32] <astropirate> as apposed to me workign on it for ever
[22:36:35] <astropirate> and it not working
[22:46:10] <mfoxdogg|work> is there anyway to keep track of what events are assigned and what are not?
[22:46:28] <Cork> assigned?
[22:46:36] <Cork> you mean what events are bound to an element?
[22:46:39] <coldhead> mfoxdogg|work: there is this http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[22:46:44] <iamamoron> hi there any ideas how to change the table td value, the value of the td came from an external iframe
[22:46:46] <iamamoron> any ideas?
[22:46:54] <mfoxdogg|work> Cork: yes
[22:47:17] <Cork> mfoxdogg|work: if every event is added through jquery then yes theres a way
[22:47:19] <Cork> else no
[22:47:24] <iamamoron> ?
[22:47:38] <mfoxdogg|work> Cork: cool
[22:48:00] <Cork> $.data(elm, 'events') if i remember correctly
[22:48:15] <Stephen> mfoxdogg|work: use .data('events")
[22:48:25] <Stephen> It's considered bad form, but it works
[22:48:32] <iamamoron> ?
[22:48:35] <iamamoron> any ideas?
[22:48:36] <mfoxdogg|work> ok
[22:48:45] <coldhead> it's not guaranteed to work in newer jQueries
[22:48:48] <Cork> Stephen: if i remember correctly that access has been removed since 1.7
[22:48:52] <iamamoron> on how to replace the value of the td but values should be from external iframe
[22:48:54] <Stephen> Grr
[22:48:57] <coldhead> that's what i was going to say
[22:49:02] <coldhead> i thought it was gone or going
[22:49:02] <iamamoron> ?
[22:49:16] <coldhead> can you show us your code, iamamoron
[22:49:44] <Stephen> mfoxdogg|work: You could always setup a system to register all event bindings to a subscribing array or something
[22:49:58] <iamamoron> here is the scenario
[22:50:00] <Cork> Stephen: $.data(elm, 'events') works
[22:50:03] <iamamoron> i have a table
[22:50:12] <iamamoron> there is a change button
[22:50:15] <Cork> its just the form where you access it directly on the element thats gone
[22:50:18] <iamamoron> the change button calls the iframe
[22:50:35] <Stephen> iamamoron: That will work fine as long as the iframe is on the same domain
[22:50:40] <iamamoron> whatever selected inside the iframe should be displayed in the table td
[22:50:45] <iamamoron> yes
[22:50:46] <iamamoron> the same
[22:50:59] <Stephen> iamamoron: Otherwise, you'll need the page in the iframe to have an iframe inside it with a page on your domain in it
[22:51:04] <iamamoron> my problem i how to put the selected value in the iframe
[22:51:07] <iamamoron> to the table
[22:51:19] <iamamoron> as i have said it is the same domain
[22:51:33] <Stephen> iamamoron: Does your iframe have an id?
[22:51:45] <iamamoron> yes
[22:51:52] <Stephen> iamamoron: Also, does your td have an id?
[22:52:05] <iamamoron> yes
[22:52:22] <Cork> mfoxdogg|work, Stephen: http://jsfiddle.net/Y9fNT/
[22:52:26] <mfoxdogg|work> Cork: i get undefined
[22:52:30] <iamamoron> i want to get what ever selected there at iframe
[22:52:34] <iamamoron> any samples?
[22:52:38] <Cork> mfoxdogg|work: its _data not data :)
[22:52:46] <mfoxdogg|work> oh
[22:52:58] <Stephen> iamamoron: Give your iframe a name
[22:53:27] <iamamoron> any sample somehwer?
[22:53:30] <iamamoron> i can look into?
[22:53:35] <Stephen> $('tdid').html($('body', frames['nameOfMyIframe'].document).html())
[22:53:46] <Stephen> There you are
[22:53:52] <Stephen> Content of iframe into td
[22:54:00] <iamamoron> no no
[22:54:08] <iamamoron> it should be the trigger from i frame
[22:54:15] <iamamoron> there is a button in the iframe
[22:54:24] <iamamoron> when that button is press it has value
[22:54:36] <iamamoron> something like you are selected a soda from i frame
[22:54:47] <iamamoron> and i want that soda to be my current value of my td
[22:54:49] <Stephen> ok, then
[22:54:57] <Cork> iamamoron: document.parent will get you the parent page
[22:55:19] <Cork> or was it window.parent, always mix that up -_-'
[22:55:24] <iamamoron> no my problem is i need to point it in my exact td
[22:55:30] <mfoxdogg|work> cork nope, still getting undefined
[22:55:31] <Stephen> Your onclick of the button should be like this: $('tdid',window.top).html(value)
[22:55:42] <Cork> mfoxdogg|work: check the fiddle
[22:55:44] <iamamoron> when the parent table is click one of its td
[22:55:46] <Cork> mfoxdogg|work: it works
[22:55:52] <iamamoron> you can do (this)
[22:55:55] <iamamoron> as marker
[22:56:05] <Cork> mfoxdogg|work: btw what solution you need to use depends on the version of jquery
[22:56:21] <Cork> Stephen: top is risky
[22:56:34] <iamamoron> so that you waill just have to to at jquery $(this).find.("#thisid").text(theval)
[22:56:42] <Cork> you might get a different window then you expected if its ex. run through a translator
[22:56:58] <iamamoron> that is my difficulty
[22:57:23] <iamamoron> i want the iframe to know that i am clicking a particular td in a particular tr
[22:57:32] <Stephen> Secondary way:
[22:57:41] <Cork> iamamoron: $(window.parent).content().find('#thisid').text(theval)
[22:57:47] <Stephen> Parent page have a function to change the td value
[22:58:15] <Stephen> function ParentChange(val) { $('tdid').html(val); }
[22:58:19] <Stephen> iframe page:
[22:58:42] <Stephen> onclick="parent.ParentChange('sometext');"
[22:59:00] <Cork> yuck!
[22:59:09] <Cork> dont DON'T use inline event listner!
[22:59:16] <Stephen> lol
[22:59:22] <Stephen> I'm being shorthand'
[22:59:28] <Stephen> My hopes is he understands that
[22:59:51] <Cork> wasn't the table in the parent?
[22:59:52] <Stephen> Point: Cork is right, don't use inline
[22:59:56] <Stephen> Yes
[22:59:57] <iamamoron> i know what you mean stephen
[23:00:04] <iamamoron> problem is how to pass
[23:00:08] <Stephen> Thus the ParentChange() function
[23:00:17] <iamamoron> that i am clicking in this page
[23:00:41] <Stephen> Basically: A function on the parent page can be accessed from the child page through the parent object
[23:01:19] <Stephen> Problem passing what?
[23:01:26] <Stephen> You can send any value you like
[23:01:39] <Cork> iamamoron: does the iframe create the table or where does it come from?
[23:01:54] <Cork> you can prob do every thing from inside the iframe if you like
[23:01:59] <Cork> and simplify everything a bit
[23:02:33] <Stephen> Yes. This shouldn't be a problem. You can pass anything across frame boundaries on the same domain
[23:02:48] <Cork> well not everything
[23:03:14] <Stephen> Eh, most things. And if you can't, do the next best thing and stringify it and send it across
[23:03:50] <Cork> Stephen: what i meant some checks will see the origins of things as different
[23:04:03] <Cork> ex. arrays is one of those thats a bit tricky
[23:23:33] <buddyq> hi guys, I am using jQuery prefix instead of $ for my site. I am integrating a colorpicker and it is wrapped with !function( $) {      }(window.jQuery) is that okay?
[23:23:42] <buddyq> what does that wrapper do?
[23:29:06] <Cork> buddyq: it makes sure that $ is jquery inside that wrapper
[23:29:18] <buddyq> okay so that's okay then.
[23:29:20] <Cork> yes thats ok, thats how every plugin should be written
[23:29:25] <buddyq> It protects it from clashing libraries?
[23:29:31] <buddyq> ok good
[23:30:03] <Cork> it protects it from sites that use that variable for other things
[23:31:02] <Cork> well actually if they do !function($){}(window.jQuery) or (function($){})(window.jQuery) or (function($){})(jQuery) is just a matter of taste
[23:31:51] <Cork> most common is (function($){})(jQuery)
[23:31:56] <diverdude> I tried merging 2 objects like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ZDx3w/2/ but it seems that it don't work. How else might i merge these options?
[23:32:26] <Cork> ?.extend @ diverdude
[23:32:27] <bot-t> diverdude, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[23:32:38] <Cork> merge is for arrays
[23:33:16] <diverdude> ah
[23:33:19] <diverdude> thx :)
[23:33:27] <Cork> np :)
[23:39:35] <erdos> hey anyone know the mechanism jqueryui uses to close datepicker when you click outside the datepicker? i would have though that it add a layer that covers the screen, but it doesn't seem to...
[23:40:58] <Cork> erdos: haven't checked explicitly for datepicker
[23:40:59] <blackspotwiggins> erdos, $(document).click()
[23:41:06] <Cork> but most likley... ya :=
[23:41:09] <Cork> :=)
[23:41:26] <Cork> or possibly $(document).one('click', function() {});
[23:41:42] <erdos> oh ok, so then it just checks if the thing clicked was the datepicker div or not?
[23:41:52] <blackspotwiggins> almost
[23:42:05] <Cork> erdos: either that or you stop the event at the widget border
[23:42:12] <blackspotwiggins> i check with $.contains if i click inside the datepicker or not
[23:42:23] <blackspotwiggins> but you also have to check for the header separately iirc
[23:42:32] <Cork> $(outer-most-element).click(function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); });
[23:42:36] <Cork> works too
[23:42:58] <erdos> i'm just trying to emulate the behaviour but i was thinking i might run into problems when i'm checking what was clicked.....
[23:43:20] <erdos> oh $.contains is probably what i need!
[23:43:28] <erdos> lemme check that out, 1 sec
[23:43:31] <blackspotwiggins> contains takes plain dom objects tho
[23:43:34] <blackspotwiggins> not jquery ones
[23:43:45] <blackspotwiggins> but that's what event.target is anyway
[23:44:06] <erdos> do click events bubble back down the dom... if that question makes sense
[23:44:17] <Cork> yes they do
[23:44:23] <erdos> kewl!
[23:44:26] <Cork> unless they hit stopPropagation()
[23:44:34] <erdos> hmmm
[23:44:38] * erdos thinks
[23:44:48] <blackspotwiggins> they bubble up iirc
[23:44:53] <blackspotwiggins> not down
[23:45:03] <Cork> lol i think thats what he meant :)
[23:45:16] <blackspotwiggins> some mouse events actually work the other way
[23:45:37] <erdos> like so <div class="tony1">  <div class="tony2"> </div> </div>....... $(".tony1").click(...); // responds when you click on tony2?
[23:45:45] <erdos> i couldn't really just try this
[23:45:47] <erdos> i mean
[23:45:48] <erdos> could
[23:45:52] <erdos> i could really just try this
[23:46:00] <Cork> yes thats how it works
[23:46:21] <Cork> thats what makes delegated event listeners work
[23:47:14] <erdos> i just get confused, because in my brain is left pre-jquery days stuff where sometimes this worked, sometimes it didn't
[23:47:20] <erdos> but thanks for that confirmation
[23:47:25] <erdos> Cork++
[23:47:30] <erdos> blackspotwiggins++
[23:47:38] <erdos> i'm going to go try this and report back
[23:47:49] <jhsto> I'm trying to load a form trough ajax and then post it, but I cant see my form on post header. Any idea what I could do?
[23:48:15] <jhsto> I can see it on my page after it has been loaded, and I can access the values of it and everything.
[23:48:35] <jhsto> And there is value on it, but it wont be notified on post.
[23:52:53] <rigid> ahoy!
[23:53:07] <rigid> i have a newbie question about jsTree, hope i'm right here...
[23:53:23] <rigid> I'm using FileReader() & DOMParser() to read a custom XML file and now I'd like to arrange all nodes in a jsTree... What would be the smartest way to do it? create json/html data? Or generating the jsTree nodes directly using the API?
[23:53:27] <coldhead> what does "notified on post" mean
[23:54:39] <coldhead> your question is welcome here rigid but i think the jstree experts are sleeping
[23:54:43] <coldhead> like baby lambs
[23:55:18] <rigid> coldhead: that someone/something gets notified upon post? :) "notify on post" gives some search results...
[23:55:23] <rigid> coldhead: ah, thanks
[23:56:04] <rigid> i'll idle here until they wake up (or the wolves come :)
[23:57:42] <jhsto> coldhead, by that I mean it does not show up on the form data, when posted.
[23:58:27] <jhsto> The POST redirects me to a page, where I can see the POST request headers, where also my ajaxed form data should be in. However, it is not there.
[23:58:59] <jhsto> It would be really crucial for me to get my data shown in POST form data.
[23:59:19] <jhsto> I can try to explain further if you did not understand my question.
[23:59:22] <Cork> jhsto: is it inside the form your submitting?
[23:59:28] <jhsto> I admit that I'm really bad at questions.
[23:59:32] <jhsto> Oh
[23:59:34] <jhsto> :)
[23:59:36] <jhsto> no
[23:59:41] <Cork> there you go
