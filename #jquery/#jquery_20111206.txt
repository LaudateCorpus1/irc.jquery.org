[00:00:14] <sdwrage> the reason I ask is I have dynamic content I need to fit into a fixed height div. I want to be able to cut the text after a sentence ends but before the height limit starts
[00:01:10] <diverdud`> sdwrage: set a width?
[00:02:36] <Eviltwin> sdwrage: The only "good" option is to use overflow: hidden
[00:05:00] <sdwrage> Eviltwin, :\ this is what I am fearing. The only problem with that is that it cuts off half of sentences
[00:05:18] <Whirl3d> when I type a comma, e.which indicates that I am typing %....any ideas why?
[00:05:32] <sdwrage> I swear my client expects far too much out of this project lol
[00:05:32] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: What are you going by? ASCII codes?
[00:05:58] <sdwrage> He wants a pdf layout with dynamic content in the columns… and wants them to cut to a specific size… at the end of a sentence...
[00:06:02] <sdwrage> x.x
[00:06:02] <Whirl3d> I dunno. I just used String.fromCharCode(e.which); and came up with % when I typed a comma
[00:06:13] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/kLTHM/12/
[00:06:23] <Eviltwin> That'd be ASCII
[00:06:24] <Eviltwin> http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html
[00:06:36] <Eviltwin> Try e.charCode
[00:09:28] <Whirl3d> e.charCode==0 every key I press.
[00:10:32] <sneak_> my .html() for a span is <a blah>blah</a>IMPORTANT<a>blah</a>, how do i strip tags and their contents?
[00:11:06] <Eviltwin> sneak_: What are you trying to have at the end?
[00:11:14] <sneak_> IMPORTANT
[00:11:25] <sneak_> i would have thought that was self-explanatory
[00:11:45] <sneak_> .text() includes the blahs inside the <a> tags
[00:12:07] <sneak_> shoudl i set the html() on the 'a's to '' then use .text()?
[00:12:35] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/ducPG/
[00:12:53] <Eviltwin> sneak_: $("span").children().remove()
[00:13:20] <sneak_> how can i do it without modifying the DOM?
[00:13:23] <Ukto> anyone here good at content design? modifying sites to make things fit in and look nice? (i know its not jquery) but I need some webdev done. (I am more about backend code, then front end looks)
[00:13:33] <sneak_> can i copy the span object?
[00:13:37] <Eviltwin> sneak_: Why do you want to not modify the DOM?
[00:14:00] <sneak_> because i'm reading data into an object representation out of the DOM and don't want to change the way it's displayed.
[00:14:07] <sneak_> i'm making a third-party script to interface with a site i can't change
[00:14:11] <sneak_> screen scraping, son
[00:14:15] <Cork> sneak_: $('a').hide() ?
[00:14:24] <Eviltwin> sneak_: $("span").clone().children().remove().end().text();
[00:14:30] <sneak_> ahh, perfect
[00:14:31] <sneak_> thx
[00:14:37] <sneak_> clone() is what i was asking
[00:14:50] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/Jxk6V/
[00:15:02] <Zogot> Ahoy all
[00:16:40] <sneak_> Eviltwin: do you play with coffeescript at all?
[00:17:11] <Whirl3d> keydown shows different results: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/ducPG/3/
[00:17:36] <Eviltwin> sneak_: No, I prefer JavaScript
[00:17:51] <sneak_> Eviltwin: to each their own
[00:18:00] <sneak_> it's really just a macro language for javascript
[00:18:23] <Eviltwin> I don't like compiling into an interpreted language
[00:18:38] <sente> I don't think javascript is so difficult that coffeescript is warrented
[00:18:43] <sneak_> i don't either, but i like if (typeof elvis !== "undefined" && elvis !== null)  even less
[00:18:44] <sente> Eviltwin: agreed
[00:19:43] <Eviltwin> Well I'm rarely in a situation where I don't know what variables are in my scope
[00:20:01] <Eviltwin> And am rarely in a situation where I can't rely on a truthy test
[00:20:23] <Eviltwin> And even if I can't rely on that, I rarely use null so I generally end up with (o.prop !== undefined)
[00:20:32] <Eviltwin> Which I don't mind so much
[00:20:58] <sneak_> which in coffeescript is "expr if o.prop?"
[00:21:21] <sneak_> i dunno, i hate node and everything that comes along with it
[00:21:25] <sneak_> but i think coffeescript is cool
[00:21:29] <sneak_> peverse, but useful
[00:21:32] <sneak_> kind of like my girlfriend
[00:21:36] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, can you please explain why .keydown gives a different e.which than .keypress? And how do I get the string value of the key pressed (i.e.  a comma, gives me a comma)?
[00:21:37] <sneak_> perverse, rather
[00:22:03] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: keyCode refers to the key index on the keyboard
[00:22:09] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: So it can vary by keyboard
[00:23:03] <Whirl3d> I just want to know when someone presses a comma or not. Is that possible?
[00:23:20] <Eviltwin> Any reason you can't use keypress?
[00:23:23] <Whirl3d> and it has to be on keydown, not keypress, not keyup
[00:23:31] <Whirl3d> Yess, I'm restricting input
[00:23:46] <Eviltwin> The keyCode is probably 188
[00:24:07] <Whirl3d> If I capture the key event on keydown, then I can preventDefault to keep keyup from adding the character to the input field
[00:27:54] <radiantstatic> I got the panel to slide successfully (just click the mail button in the left panel. But I can't get it to close via the current method I have in place - http://radiantstatic.com/build/
[00:29:44] <Ortund> I'm making an image gallery, thumbnails are being placed in a table row whose cells are named "img1", "img2", etc. When I click the next, previous button, I need to get the thumbnail's src property for the image tag. I'm targetting the cell, how do I get it's child elements
[00:32:30] <KingFisher> Hello
[00:32:39] <KingFisher> I have a div element with multiple classes
[00:32:55] <KingFisher> How do I select just the class I want within the div element instead of selecting all the classes and ids within it
[00:33:06] <Hierofant> bot-t, .child() @ Ortund
[00:33:22] <Hierofant> ?.child()
[00:33:30] <Hierofant> .child()
[00:33:42] <Hierofant> dang I forgot cmd
[00:34:04] <Hierofant> ?.child
[00:34:08] <Cork> KingFisher: your talking about filtering the class attribute, or filter matches in a selector?
[00:34:11] <Eviltwin> It's .children
[00:34:14] <Hierofant> lol
[00:34:29] <Ortund> Hierofant: thanks, just found it in the api
[00:34:33] <KingFisher> Cork, I am talking about filtering the class attribute I think.
[00:34:49] <Cork> Ortund: you might want to use .find('img'). if the img isn't direct sibling
[00:34:58] <Hierofant> :first-child
[00:35:00] <Cork> KingFisher: then you need to use regex
[00:35:25] <Cork> KingFisher: thats string work, and jquery has almost none for that
[00:35:35] <Cork> s/none/nothing/
[00:35:44] <Hierofant> javascript does tho
[00:35:48] <KingFisher> Cork, wait maybe I did not explain to myself
[00:36:01] <KingFisher> I have a class called name="value" and I just want to replace the value inside the class
[00:36:08] <Ortund> Cork, I can search by class name as each <td id="img(n)"> will only have 1 image tag in it
[00:36:15] <KingFisher> Do I really need regex for that?
[00:36:33] <Cork> KingFisher: uh.. what do you mean with class?
[00:36:43] <Cork> class doens't have attributes so it can't have name=""
[00:36:51] <Ortund> but now I have a problem. How do I determine which image to show? For instance if I change image by clicking on a thumbnail, and then click the previous button, how will jquery know which image to show me?
[00:37:11] <KingFisher> Cork, sorry I am new to this If I did not explain myself. Ill try pastebining the HTML to show you what I mean
[00:38:09] <Ortund> Cork: var imgTarget = $(this).children(".imageThumb").src;
[00:38:48] <KingFisher> Cork, the value inside the "trip" class Is what I want to sub with another value
[00:38:49] <KingFisher> http://pastebin.com/3FfTcnR7
[00:39:14] <Cork> Ortund: children only works if .imageTumb is direct child, it does NOT find grand children grand grand children
[00:39:28] <Cork> *or grand grand*
[00:39:32] <KingFisher> If I described it incorrectly I apologize...Im new to this lol
[00:39:53] <Eviltwin> KingFisher: And what do you have a handle to?
[00:39:55] <Ortund> Cork, I don't need it to
[00:40:11] <KingFisher> Eviltwin, what do you mean?
[00:40:33] <Ortund> Cork: <td id="img1"><img class="imageThumb src="images/image1.jpg" alt="image1.jpg" /></td>
[00:40:34] <Eviltwin> You just want to change the value in the element with class trip?
[00:40:46] <Eviltwin> That could be $(".trip").text("Cancelled!");
[00:41:01] <Eviltwin> But that will be every trip on the page
[00:41:20] <Eviltwin> Is that what you want?
[00:41:30] <KingFisher> Eviltwin, That is what I want to do. I want to replace every tripcode on the page with "anonymous"
[00:41:35] <Cork> Ortund: then yes, childrend works in that case
[00:41:44] <Eviltwin> Okay, $(".trip").text("anonymous");
[00:41:46] <Eviltwin> However
[00:41:46] <KingFisher>  $(".trip").text("Cancelled!").replaceWith("Anonymous")'
[00:41:49] <KingFisher> like that?
[00:41:58] <Eviltwin> No, $(".trip").text("anonymous");
[00:42:01] <KingFisher> alright
[00:42:01] <Eviltwin> But be warned
[00:42:04] <KingFisher> Thank you
[00:42:05] <Eviltwin> If they aren't running JavaScript
[00:42:07] <Eviltwin> Or just view the source
[00:42:09] <Ortund> Cork: But for a next/previous button, how can I tell jquery which image is currently selected?
[00:42:12] <Eviltwin> The trip codes will still be there
[00:42:24] <KingFisher> Eviltwin, Alright thanks.
[00:42:25] <Cork> Ortund: you would have to store it
[00:42:28] <Eviltwin> There's nothing you can do in JavaScript to hide something that's in the HTML
[00:42:44] <KingFisher> Eviltwin, I just want the tripcodes to not be visible to people
[00:42:48] <Cork> Ortund: with .data on the image or in a global varialbe
[00:42:50] <KingFisher> I am trying to make an add on for a website i use
[00:43:02] <Cork> *variable
[00:43:19] <Eviltwin> Okay, but if someone tries they can still find it
[00:43:22] <Eviltwin> That's all I want you to be aware of
[00:43:38] <KingFisher> alright. thanks for the help mate
[00:46:46] <Ortund> how can I substring my id attribute for <td id="img1"> so that I can just get the number 1?
[00:48:22] <Cork> ?eval parseInt(/\d/.exec("img1"), 10)
[00:48:32] <Cork> ah... the bot is dead...
[00:48:51] <Cork> anyway thats what you want
[00:48:52] <Ortund> haha can you explain what that does exactly?
[00:49:13] <Cork> the regex drabs all digits in the string
[00:49:21] <Cork> and parseInt converts it into Number
[00:49:39] <Cork> opps
[00:49:49] <Cork> should have been parseInt(/\d+/.exec("img1"), 10)
[00:50:06] <Ortund> so... var ImageID = ?eval parseInt(/\d+/.exec("img1"), 10); will store the value 1
[00:50:17] <Cork> no remove the ?eval
[00:50:20] <Cork> thats for the bot
[00:50:24] <Ortund> oh kk
[00:50:36] <Cork> and you need to replace "img1" with the id from the element
[00:54:27] <Ortund> Cork: imgID = parseInt(/\d+/.exec($(this).parent.attr('id')), 10); ...no method 'attr'
[00:54:43] <Cork> parent()
[00:55:07] <Ortund> bleh couldn't decide if I needed those ()
[00:55:17] <EdwardIII> hey
[00:55:18] <Ortund> whats NaN?
[00:55:24] <Cork> everything in query is a function
[00:55:26] <Ortund> not a number?
[00:55:34] <Cork> except for the inherited array
[00:55:35] <EdwardIII> i'm trying to get dialog to open higher up the viewport - at the moment the top is smack bang in the middle of the viewport which is too low for my rather chunky window
[00:56:05] <EdwardIII> i've tried this but no luck: https://gist.github.com/1437449
[00:56:10] <Cork> Ortund: that means parseInt failed cause the id didn't have any digits in it
[00:56:30] <EdwardIII> infact it's almost like none of my settings there are being read at all
[00:58:56] <Ortund> Cork: http://pastebin.com/gxivm4ss
[01:00:30] <maqr> is it possible to make jquery do a PUT file upload to s3 with a signed URL?
[01:01:09] <Cork> maqr: sure
[01:01:18] <maqr> Cork: how does that work from a security point of view?
[01:01:20] <Cork> you can generate a form let the user select a file and submit it
[01:01:29] <Cork> maqr: ajax can't upload files reliably
[01:02:00] <maqr> Cork: i'm not sure i follow... what do you mean by a form and why can't ajax upload files reliably?
[01:02:29] <Cork> Ortund: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/2AF8e/
[01:03:02] <EdwardIII> ah, looks like it actually works like this: $('#dialog').dialog({ width: 300 /* insert your options */ }).dialog('widget').position({ my: 'left', at: 'right', of: $(this) });
[01:03:05] <Cork> maqr: js can't really upload files
[01:03:22] <EdwardIII> if i say my: top at: top, it goes flush to the top - is there anyway i can say something like top + 50px?
[01:03:25] <maqr> Cork: define 'really'? :) i'm thinking about in a controlled environment, i can demand latest firefox/chrome/whatever
[01:03:26] <Cork> maqr: you need to use hacks like iframes or flash or things like that
[01:03:34] <maqr> Cork: something about html5?
[01:03:37] <Cork> maqr: or you need to reload the page and do a full form submition
[01:03:55] <Cork> maqr: ya, you can do it through the file api, but its not supported in all browsers
[01:04:10] <maqr> Cork: i'm 100% ok with dictating browser usage, this is for an internal thing
[01:04:23] <Ortund> Cork: what's the difference?
[01:04:32] <Cork> Ortund: donno
[01:04:44] <Cork> i more or less just copied your code into jsfiddle so i could run it
[01:05:50] * mocas yoh!
[01:05:52] <Cork> maqr: then yes you can do it, have a look at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_files_from_web_applications
[01:05:59] <Ortund> haha Cork, I need grandparent for the image tag
[01:06:14] <Ortund> forgot there's an <a> around the image too
[01:06:15] <Cork> Ortund: or closest
[01:06:30] <Cork> closest is prob the best solution
[01:06:37] <Cork> closest('td')
[01:06:38] <Ortund> so it's <td id="img1"><a href\
[01:06:42] <Ortund> frack
[01:06:55] <maqr> Cork: this looks awesome
[01:07:11] <maqr> Cork: can i also i read the file data in and pre-process it before upload? or does it have to go direct from disk?
[01:07:22] <Cork> maqr: yes
[01:07:35] <Cork> maqr: but be warned ie is out of your touch
[01:08:02] <Cork> ie10 might support it, haven't looked
[01:09:00] <EdwardIII> maqr: if not, i've had some success with this: https://github.com/valums/file-uploader
[01:09:23] <maqr> Cork: 100% ok with that
[01:11:06] <maqr> EdwardIII: that looks neat for compatibility, but i think i'm going to go completely bleeding edge for once :)
[01:11:40] <EdwardIII> maqr: always nice
[01:11:44] <EdwardIII> to be able to do that heh
[01:11:59] <EdwardIII> anyone know how i can change 'of' to 'viewport'?
[01:12:33] <tocsick> hey I've got a script that's working, but it doesn't work in wordpress for wahtever reason - any ideas?
[01:13:10] <EdwardIII> ah, window instead of document
[01:13:13] <EdwardIII> brill
[01:13:26] <EdwardIII> tocsick: had a look at jquery wordpress in google?
[01:13:38] <tocsick> am right now
[01:13:41] <EdwardIII> tocsick: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script#jQuery_noConflict_wrappers
[01:13:46] <tocsick> followed instructions on some tut but blankscreen
[01:13:48] <Ortund> so now how do I access a grandchild of my #img1 tag?
[01:13:48] <amok__> Hi there
[01:14:00] <Ortund> find() doesn't seem to return anything
[01:14:05] <Ortund> that or I'm using it wrong
[01:14:10] <amok__> try parents('div')
[01:14:16] <Cork> Ortund: .find('img')
[01:14:30] <amok__> $('#img').parents('div')
[01:14:37] <Ortund> Cork: var target = $("#img" + imgID - 1).find(".thumbimg").attr("src");
[01:14:41] <Cork> chand child not parent :)
[01:14:48] <Ortund> amok__: I'm trying to go the other way
[01:15:05] <Cork> chand=grand
[01:15:19] <amok__> what about $('.img > .thumbnail)
[01:15:29] <Cork> Ortund: there is no need to go that way around to get the next image
[01:15:42] <Ortund> I'm getting previous image currently
[01:16:02] <Cork> Ortund: just do $(this).closest('td').next().find('img') and $(this).closest('td').prev().find('img')
[01:16:08] <Ortund> var target = $("#img" + imgID - 1).find(".thumbimg").attr("src");       <<< problem was with the img - 1 bit
[01:16:29] <amok__> HI there.. I am using jquery datepicker.. Is there any way, how to highlight some dates in this calendar?
[01:17:33] <Cork> oh wait it was the arrow
[01:18:04] <Cork> Ortund: btw i would save the complete id instead
[01:18:16] <Cork> skip all the regex part
[01:19:59] <Cork> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/2AF8e/1/
[01:20:19] <tocsick> ewardiii i've got it wrapped, but still not working somehow. it works on jsfiddle, but not wp - so i must be doing something wrong with loading this up
[01:20:38] <Cork> Ortund: sorry typo http://jsfiddle.net/2AF8e/2/
[01:24:09] <Ortund> Cork: so using find() isn't the best way to go?
[01:24:33] <Cork> Ortund: it is, but not if its not needed
[01:24:35] <Ortund> oh, nm
[01:24:41] <Cork> you already have the object, so why search for it
[01:24:46] <Cork> just save it
[01:25:06] <Cork> $currTD will be the table row
[01:25:21] <Cork> then you just have to walk up or down depending on where you want to go
[01:26:14] <Cork> Ortund: don't forget to update currTD when the arrow is clicked though
[01:27:45] <goshawk> how can i set a .ready() event on a div that eventually will be in the page in the future?
[01:28:05] <Ortund> yeah Cork, I just remembered that
[01:28:27] <Cork> goshawk: you can't
[01:28:47] <Cork> some browsers has dom tree modified events, but not all
[01:29:34] <Ortund> Cork: for my previous button, I check if (img >= 1) before I do anything so that if imgID = 0, it won't try going to a -1... how can I limit the next button in the same way? So that it doesn't go past the last image?
[01:29:59] <goshawk> Cork ok
[01:30:04] <Cork> Ortund: $currTD.index() >= 0
[01:30:15] <Cork> should be the same :)
[01:30:18] <ravenzz> ?newContent @ goshawk
[01:30:28] <Cork> bots down
[01:30:39] <ravenzz> uhuh
[01:30:50] <tocsick> yeah so i'm completely retarded at loading jquery correctly in wordpress
[01:30:55] <ravenzz> goshawk maybe newContent() is what are you looking for
[01:31:09] <goshawk> ravenzz, when can i find doc?
[01:31:31] <tocsick> is it possible that my localhost is the problem?
[01:32:30] <ravenzz> goshawk uhm https://gist.github.com/1003630#file_jquery.new_content.js
[01:32:50] <ravenzz> tocsick ask on #wordpress
[01:32:56] <k3ks> hi, i have a problem with the .after() function
[01:33:09] <k3ks> i read that it only accepts valid html
[01:33:38] <k3ks> and it seems thats the reason why it strips <td> and <tr> tags out of my html :(
[01:33:39] <Cork> k3ks: all of jquery only accepts valid html
[01:33:44] <Cork> k3ks: it works with the dom
[01:34:03] <k3ks> because there is no table element in the html i want to insert
[01:34:11] <Cork> k3ks: you need to fix your markup so its falid
[01:34:18] <Cork> *valid
[01:34:30] <k3ks> but i want to add table rows to an existing table
[01:34:46] <goshawk> ravenzz, i reveive the new content as text, is it possible to build jquery node from that, apply a ready event and put it into the page?
[01:34:47] <Cork> then you need add it in that table
[01:34:53] <Cork> not after
[01:35:02] <k3ks> i add it after a tr element
[01:35:33] <maitre_kaio> could you copy past the html you want to insert ?
[01:35:35] <Cork> k3ks: and what you'r adding is <tr></td></td></tr> ?
[01:36:03] <ravenzz> goshawk what ready means in this case?
[01:36:10] <ravenzz> goshawk can you be more specific
[01:36:10] <ravenzz> ?
[01:36:17] <k3ks> http://pastebin.com/TQQChWrU
[01:36:30] <k3ks> maybe it's the <input> elements
[01:36:35] <Cork> ravenzz: he wants to be notified when the div has been renderd from the dom
[01:36:37] <goshawk> ravenzz, i've to take html from a ajax request, set up nivo slider and put in the page
[01:36:51] <Cork> k3ks: it is
[01:37:13] <Cork> k3ks: only tr/thead/tbody/tfoot is valid in table
[01:37:36] <ravenzz> goshawk ok, so what about load() ?
[01:37:38] <k3ks> hm, ok
[01:37:53] <k3ks> then i'll go and figure out a workaround
[01:38:15] <goshawk> ravenzz, load() seems to do not work
[01:38:18] <goshawk> tying again
[01:39:29] <k3ks> thanks, i found a good solution
[01:40:39] <goshawk> ravenzz, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/516972 this is never executed
[01:41:12] <goshawk> the same but with load ready event is executed once even if the .infowindow is not in the page at all
[01:41:25] <Ortund> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/2AF8e/3/ the prev/next buttons don't work
[01:42:24] <Cork> Ortund: heh you miss understood a bit...
[01:42:48] <Ortund> should've guessed lol
[01:43:57] <ravenzz> goshawk one sec, I am busy
[01:44:16] <Cork> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/2AF8e/4/
[01:44:38] <Cork> Ortund: i would also recomend to use something like data-image or data-src instead of highjacking alt
[01:45:27] <goshawk> ravenzz, ok
[01:45:40] <Cork> Ortund: o btw in next you want index < $currTD.siblings().length
[01:45:49] <Cork> not >= 0
[01:50:16] <selckin> what's a decent lib to format source code these days for display with js?
[01:51:02] <batte> Hi everybod. I have a idea for a new site but I need someone to give me an opinion ... anyone?
[01:51:21] <Ortund> Cork: index < $currTD.siblings().length ... what is index?
[01:52:10] <Cork> the function your using
[01:52:23] <Cork> $currTD.index()
[01:52:55] <Cork> Ortund: its a bit of semi code, so you'll have to think a bit your self ;)
[01:53:48] <EdwardIII> hrm, jquery dialogs seem to be aligned my: top at: center by default
[01:54:02] <EdwardIII> i've tried changing to my: center at: centre of: self, and also window - but no luck
[01:54:04] <EdwardIII> any clues?
[01:54:16] <ravenzz> goshawk did you tried $('.infowindow').load('http://foo.com/path/to/your/data.php', function(){ console.log('ready'); } ?
[01:54:18] <tocsick> hi all. i have a script that works great on jsfiddle, but does not work at all on local host - what am i doing wrong?
[01:54:35] <ChrisK3> sorry about this, I'm fairly new to jQuery, got some JS experience in the past, but it's hazy: http://pastebin.com/nsXsSceg I get syntax errors, could someone show me  the proper way to do it? all these }  ) ; are confusing the heck out of me
[01:54:48] <Cork> EdwardIII: if you update a dialog its position needs to be recalculated
[01:55:03] <ChrisK3> edit the pastebin and link the correct version thanks
[01:55:12] <Cork> EdwardIII: if your laying it out a new theres the position pref
[01:56:16] <goshawk> ravenzz, no
[01:56:22] <goshawk> wait. i do
[01:56:34] <EdwardIII> Cork: i think i'm handling the recalulation issue OK: https://gist.github.com/1437614
[01:56:40] <ravenzz> mhmh
[01:56:46] <ChrisK3> "missing ) after argument list $(this).css(" is what firebug's console says
[01:56:50] <EdwardIII> i've used offset, but 'center center' would have handled the issue i think
[01:56:51] <MrBenn> ChrisK3 if you are just doing a basic hover to change styles use the CSS :hover ability
[01:57:08] <EdwardIII> except it doesn't heh
[01:57:10] <ChrisK3> MrBenn: I'm not, I'm using php and mysql to use color pickers
[01:57:11] <EdwardIII> (offset is a workaround)
[01:57:27] <Ortund> Cork, no errors, but the <img class="mainImage"> isn't changing
[01:57:33] <ravenzz> I haven't fall into this issues before http://jsfiddle.net/4KhRr/ ... it is so noob :o any workaround?
[01:57:55] <ChrisK3> basically the color of the item and the hover color are dynamic
[01:57:59] <goshawk> ravenzz, cool idea, but unfortunately it will take 30 mins to test.. thanks :)
[01:58:12] <EdwardIII> although offset doesn't seem to be relative to document rather than window/viewport
[01:58:40] <MrBenn> ChrisK3 http://pastebin.com/ZTgcfQUf
[01:58:42] <ChrisK3> trust me I know about :hover, I'm a lot better at CSS than JS/jQ
[01:58:49] <MrBenn> I think that should fix your syntax error
[01:59:08] <MrBenn> you had a } in the wrong place
[01:59:12] <Cork> Ortund: its not part of the html you sent so not sure what it is
[01:59:33] <ravenzz> :?
[01:59:36] <tocsick> hi all. i have a script that works great on jsfiddle, but does not work at all on local host - what am i doing wrong? is it even possible that it's the script, or am i being an ubernoob who can't figure out how to call a js file?
[02:00:12] <Ortund> Cork, mainImage.attr("src", newSrc); in the code just changes the src attribute for the "enlarged" image that's been selected
[02:00:12] <Gavrisimo> tocsick: feel free to paste link to that jsfiddle
[02:00:47] <tocsick> http://jsfiddle.net/Qsg6e/13/ the script changes the class of the parent div when you hover over a <li>
[02:00:56] <Cork> Ortund: and your sure mainImage is the element your after?
[02:01:17] <tocsick> that version there is with html copied directly from the site where it's not working
[02:01:19] <ChrisK3> MrBenn: that gives me a different syntax error :\
[02:02:05] <Ortund> ya
[02:02:25] <Ortund> the image still changes when I click on the thumbnails
[02:03:24] <Mech0z> Anyone reason this alert($('.si-accordion').text()); dont work in firefox 3.6 but works in chrome? In FF3.6 it just gives me an empty alert box, but in chrome it gives me all 7 names I expect
[02:04:59] <MrBenn> ChrisK3 whats the new error?
[02:05:01] <Ortund> Cork: the if conditions on the next/previous button clicks aren't being met
[02:05:22] <ChrisK3> Syntax Error var origcolor = $(this).css("color");
[02:05:32] <ravenzz> Cork do you have any idea how I can make it possible http://jsfiddle.net/4KhRr/ ?
[02:05:38] <ravenzz> (working)
[02:05:38] <Ortund> I had them backwards :/
[02:06:56] <Ortund> hmm put the conditions where they should've been ans still no luck
[02:07:20] <MrBenn> :/
[02:08:21] <Cork> ravenzz: that should work just fine, except posibly for the form fill feature in browsers
[02:08:50] <MrBenn> Chris3K the origcolor won't be present in the second function as it's localised to the first function handler
[02:09:27] <ravenzz> I basically get some data back from an ajax request, I have an hidden (by .hide()) fieldset, and I should set some values to its input fields
[02:09:31] <ravenzz> and it is not working
[02:09:59] <ravenzz> so I made a really simple fiddle, and it is not working too
[02:10:26] <ChrisK3> anyone else got any input on http://pastebin.com/ZTgcfQUf and why it's giving me syntax errors?
[02:10:27] <ravenzz> if you inspect the result you can that #bar has no val
[02:11:03] <ChrisK3> I'm sure it's something stupid simple like a misplaced bracket or similar... but I can't find it
[02:11:14] <ravenzz> you can see*
[02:12:22] <Ortund> Cork: $currTD.Index() never gets changed. It's always at -1
[02:12:57] <seutje> ChrisK3: origcolor is defined in the scope of only 1 of the functions
[02:13:13] <Cork> Ortund: your using index with small or big I ?
[02:13:24] <MrBenn> ChrisK3 it's not, all the brackets match correctly
[02:13:34] <ChrisK3> seutje: how do I change that?
[02:13:36] <ChrisK3> sorry new to jQ
[02:13:45] <sahbeewah> also you're missing a semi-colon
[02:13:57] <maitre_kaio> anyone got a simple idea about doing that: call to animate a dive, replacing content of the div, and animating the div again ?
[02:14:00] <MrBenn> ChrisK3 I already told you origcolor was only in one scope
[02:14:14] <Ortund> Cork: small... I just wrote it with an uppercase I here for some reason
[02:14:15] <ChrisK3> MrBenn: that doesn't really mean anything to me...
[02:14:19] <MrBenn> you could either attach it to the element
[02:14:22] <ChrisK3> sahbeewah: where?
[02:14:29] <MrBenn> like $(this).origcolor = blah
[02:14:39] <sahbeewah> line 21
[02:15:14] <anoob> why is it executed twice? http://jsfiddle.net/qNMRy/
[02:15:16] <MrBenn> Sahbeewah that wouldn't cause a syntax error though
[02:15:32] <sahbeewah> yes it would
[02:15:37] <MrBenn> how?
[02:15:52] <sahbeewah> because it's a "syntax" error
[02:16:00] <MrBenn> it's a recommendation to a requirement
[02:16:03] <MrBenn> not*
[02:16:08] <Cork> Ortund: one sec let me test something
[02:16:18] <Ortund> Cork: could I not replace $currTD = $('.thumbimg td:first'); with $currTD = $('td:first'); ?
[02:16:32] <maitre_kaio> ChrisK3: basically mrbenn is tight. You need a way to remember what was the origcolor. For now, it's forgotten as soon as you go out the first function
[02:16:59] <seutje> MrBenn: that wouldn't work
[02:17:07] <MrBenn> What wouldn't?
[02:17:13] <seutje> when trying to use $(this).origcolor, it'll be a new jQuery object
[02:17:29] <MrBenn> ah yeah
[02:17:35] <MrBenn> you'd need to set this.origcolor
[02:18:03] <Cork> Ortund: could you reprocude the code in jsfiddle, it should work, but i can't tell without seeking it
[02:18:17] <seutje> actually, u could just unset the style and have it fall back to its original color :P
[02:18:18] <Cork> Ortund: and .thumbimg is needed if you have more tables in the page
[02:18:34] <MrBenn> Yeah
[02:18:53] <igore> I'm having problems passing this string to jQuery .html o.text methods, "@@@@@@@@@@"
[02:18:59] <Ortund> Cork: all the tables on the page are named with id attributes
[02:19:11] <ravenzz> Cork should I append some hidden fields?
[02:19:14] <igore> I get: uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: @@@@@
[02:19:19] <ChrisK3> can't get it to work, I get syntax errors
[02:19:32] <ChrisK3> the jQ site has nothing on variables :<
[02:19:47] <igore> thank you, got a redirect for me? ;)
[02:19:50] <MrBenn> ChrisK3 what are your syntax errors?
[02:19:54] <Cork> ravenzz: you might have to dislay the set before updating the value, don't have any other idea
[02:19:56] <anli_> Is there a way to place a yes-no question in the same manner as a ok-cancel question?
[02:19:57] <Cork> sorry
[02:19:59] <anli_> (prompt)
[02:20:04] * Cork has to get back to work now
[02:20:34] <ChrisK3> syntax error var this.origcolor = $(this).css("color");
[02:21:34] <Ortund> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/2AF8e/7/
[02:21:39] <Mech0z> Is it possible to create a json object in jquery and then send it using ajax?
[02:21:57] <Mech0z> I can only find tuts to Get Json with ajax
[02:22:05] <Ortund> well... Cork or anyone...
[02:22:10] <Cork> Mech0z: JSON.stringify(obj=
[02:22:12] <Cork> *)
[02:23:28] <beasty> le morning
[02:24:28] <beasty> http://pastebin.com/U1vhzPP7 <= any idea why the console.log doesn't output anything ?
[02:24:42] <beasty> don't mind the commenting
[02:25:12] <ChrisK3> http://pastebin.com/bjxUARQA top one works except it doesn't return the color, bottom gives me "missing variable name" "missing variable name" "var this.origcolor = $(this).css("color");"
[02:25:26] <ChrisK3> sorry pastafail
[02:25:44] <ChrisK3> this.origcolor isn't a valid variable name it seems
[02:25:50] <MrBenn> Chris3K remove 'var' from tefore this.origcolor
[02:25:55] <MrBenn> before*
[02:26:11] <beasty> ok nm replace [] with {} works
[02:26:27] <ChrisK3> ^5 MrBenn
[02:26:28] <ChrisK3> works
[02:26:36] <ChrisK3> big thanks
[02:26:41] <MrBenn> No worries
[02:31:10] <tocsick> cork im totally stumped. http://jsfiddle.net/Qsg6e/13/ works, but when i put it on a webpage (i'm calling the script in the head of the doc and also calling jquery) it's not working.
[02:31:48] <Cork> tocsick: sorry i've already put way to much time in here to day, can't help any more
[02:31:57] <seutje> ChrisK3: consider this approach: http://jsfiddle.net/5htta/
[02:32:22] <seutje> simply unsets the inline style for color on mouseleave
[02:32:32] <tocsick> okay cork, ty for all the help. anyone else: the format is just like with regular javascript, <script type="text/javascript" src="url"></script>, right?
[02:33:06] <MrBenn> I think he is setting the colours inline dynamicaly seutje
[02:34:10] <seutje> I can only work out a case based on the information I'm given
[02:34:31] <VictorCL> how can I make addClass prepend and not append the class ????
[02:36:25] <MrBenn> Not knocking you suetje, just commenting
[02:36:39] <MrBenn> your solution would be best in 9 out of 10 cases probably
[02:36:43] <EdwardIII> heh dialog.dialog is creating multiple dialogs :/
[02:36:55] <EdwardIII> somewhat predictable, but that puts me back to square 1
[02:37:25] <ChrisK3> yeah I'm setting the colors dynamically inline using PHP and js
[02:37:38] <ChrisK3> neat solution seutje though
[02:39:11] <sahbeewah> VictorCL: why is the position of a new class significant?
[02:40:53] <VictorCL> because the first class has dominance over the second one
[02:41:10] <kyrix> is there a way to load a 3rd party plugin into a specific jquery namespace, without altering the original plugin? i.e. if i want to let users use the jquery i ship: myapp.jQuery = jQuery.noConflict(true)
[02:41:21] <Aamir> VictorCL: it doesn't matter :)
[02:41:39] <Cork> EdwardIII: element.dialog('option', 'position', element.dialog('option', 'position'));
[02:41:49] <Aamir> VictorCL: the important thing is the definition of your css classes in ur css file
[02:41:50] <Cork> that should resenter the dialog
[02:42:19] <VictorCL> if   I have  <div class='normal'>   which has color:#FFF  then I want to add <div class='normal selected'>  and selected has color:#000 ,it wont work
[02:42:53] <VictorCL> but if selected was first then I it will work
[02:43:11] <sahbeewah> .normal .selected { ... }
[02:43:31] <EdwardIII> Cork: i'm seeing some weird stuff
[02:43:42] <VictorCL> yes I guess I will have to define it different in my .css
[02:43:42] <GolF> hi. when you will insert value in text box you use $(“#id”).attr(“value”,”foo”) but if you insert file in “input type file” how do you do?
[02:43:43] <EdwardIII> Cork: is that nested in your example correctly?
[02:43:58] <Cork> EdwardIII: yes
[02:44:08] <Cork> i use that code my self (changed element though)
[02:44:43] <EdwardIII> Cork: can't say i understand?
[02:45:03] <Cork> EdwardIII: uh you wanted to recenter a dialog right?
[02:45:09] <EdwardIII> Cork: yeah
[02:45:14] <Cork> that code does that
[02:45:29] <Cork> "element" is your variable that points to the dialog
[02:46:15] <Cork> it triggers the position code in ui dialog causing it to reposition it self
[02:46:38] <EdwardIII> Cork: so i'd do this in addition to what i've already written?
[02:46:42] <EdwardIII> Cork: or instead of?
[02:46:53] <Cork> EdwardIII: you do your .html() code
[02:46:59] <Cork> then you do the position update
[02:47:06] <Cork> nothing else is needed
[02:47:46] <Cork> (unless you need to update the height/width of the dialog)
[02:49:06] <sahbeewah> GolF: i don't think you can change the value of a file input to anything other than ""
[02:49:19] <sahbeewah> if that's what you were trying to do
[02:49:32] <EdwardIII> Cork: i don't actually have an html call - i'm guessing perhaps after .load then? https://gist.github.com/1437759
[02:50:23] <Cork> if you use load you would have to listen for a callback
[02:52:15] <f00li5h> meow.
[02:52:20] <EdwardIII> OK - i think load's second argument is a callback
[02:52:21] <EdwardIII> hey f00li5h
[02:52:40] <f00li5h> =^_^=
[02:52:40] <Cork> third actually, but the second is conditional
[02:52:44] <f00li5h> what's going on EdwardIII?
[02:53:29] <EdwardIII> f00li5h: working hard in my new job
[02:53:32] <f00li5h> doing some radio stuff, and i want to have the labels stay around
[02:53:34] <EdwardIII> f00li5h: made a 290 mile move!
[02:53:38] <f00li5h> oh!
[02:54:06] <Torava> hm...
[02:54:13] <EdwardIII> f00li5h: and with you?
[02:54:16] <Torava> what might be the way to find elements whose certain attribute is value1 OR value2
[02:54:22] <f00li5h> sneakyness
[02:54:34] <f00li5h> EdwardIII: trying to write some funky jquery ui for a REST based thinger
[02:54:46] <Torava> for instance, find all elements whose class attribute is elephant or camel
[02:55:04] <Torava> i mean, what is the syntax if i use a selector
[02:55:21] <f00li5h> Torava: select both?
[02:55:23] <EdwardIII> f00li5h: cool
[02:55:28] <Torava> yes.
[02:55:37] <f00li5h> $('cats p.kittens p, cats p.cats p')
[02:55:57] <f00li5h> except, you can't nest <p>s
[02:56:13] <GolF> sahbeewah : Can I put file into input file by jquery?
[02:56:25] <Torava> well. yes. how stupid i am.
[02:56:26] <Torava> thank you
[02:56:44] <EdwardIII> Cork: well... my stuff is already happening inside the second load argument? is that right/wrong? i'm actually not even sure syntactically where to put that option statement: https://gist.github.com/1437778
[02:57:46] <sahbeewah> GolF: it's a security breach, if you could do that you could change the input file prior to form submission and upload files beyond the user's control onto the server
[02:58:23] <EdwardIII> Cork: i've made an addition to line 21, but it doesn't seem to be centered in the viewport: https://gist.github.com/1437778
[03:00:00] <squeakytoy> Hey all. I have a weird problem here. Ive narrowed it down that if I do: $(MyObject).bind('key', somefunction); it works, but if I do: $(MyObject.SubObject).bind('key', somefunction); <-- I get a JQuery caching/json problem deep down in the jquery code. Anyone reckognize this problem?
[03:00:52] <squeakytoy> Binding on inner objects doesn't play well for jquery
[03:00:58] <squeakytoy> ?
[03:03:24] <f00li5h> buttonset!
[03:03:48] <f00li5h> i want to take one of the radios from a buttonset() and get its label to stick around when I hide the rest
[03:07:53] <Jahan> Can I use pastebin also to paste my code?
[03:09:35] <jorn> heyho, is there an event for whenever something is modified on a page? (i want to bind a handler to "every change" in order to add / remove css classes based on positive or negative numbers0
[03:09:40] <jorn> )
[03:11:37] <squeakytoy> heh, apparently you cannot bind events to an object, while you are in that object, for some reason :-)
[03:11:48] <squeakytoy> jorn: modified?
[03:12:40] <inki> hi
[03:13:08] <inki> with ui, is there a way to show a modal overlay without the need to use a dialog?
[03:13:54] <f00li5h> why would you want it otherwise?
[03:14:32] <Jahan> http://pastebin.com/XYhQciVx Can someone help please.
[03:14:43] <Aamir> inki:  see what css classes modal dialog uses for overlay and than append a div to the body and add those classes to that div ;)
[03:15:01] <squeakytoy> Jahan: what is the problem?
[03:15:04] <inki> i hoped jquery would offer a method for that
[03:15:04] <Jahan> Firstly I didn't get what was meant by setted, but apparently it's a typo
[03:15:22] <Jahan> But I don't know what this is supposed to do.
[03:15:41] <Jahan> Does it read from a file and then save it again?
[03:15:43] <Chibby_> maybe you shouldn't code whilst drunk then?
[03:15:57] <Jahan> It's not my code lol
[03:16:04] <f00li5h> drunk hacking is fine as long as you have version controll and unit tests ;)
[03:16:06] <Chibby_> ahh, makes more sense now (:
[03:16:07] <squeakytoy> Johan: ask the developer
[03:16:15] <Jahan> I can't
[03:17:25] <Jahan> Any idea what it's supposed to do?
[03:18:03] <Jahan> Should I put an input .txt file in file:" "
[03:18:40] <Chibby_> well it puts the file contents into a variable
[03:18:49] <Chibby_> dunno what that other weird thing in the init is though
[03:18:58] <Jahan> me too
[03:19:01] <EdwardIII> f00li5h: you got any idea how to center/center position these dialog bastards?
[03:19:32] <EdwardIII> f00li5h: using widget position doesn't work on first click heh, seems to work second time
[03:19:38] <SugaSlide> left: 50%; top: 50%
[03:19:43] <SugaSlide> nvm
[03:20:56] <sahbeewah> Jahan: why are you using it if you don't know what it does and how it does it
[03:21:06] <Chibby_> Jahan: seems to be missing the updLstChr() function
[03:21:10] <sahbeewah> looks like it's trying to simulate a typewriter effect
[03:21:14] <sahbeewah> animation
[03:21:14] <Chibby_> i suspect it's meant to "type" out the contents of a file
[03:21:23] <Chibby_> yah that
[03:22:27] <Torava> interesting... i thought using filter() instead of find() is a faster way
[03:22:50] <Jahan> I want to test it.
[03:23:22] <Torava> but no, i tested with firebug; filter: 1.191 ms, 224 calls vs find: 0.142 ms, 10 calls
[03:23:40] <Torava> $('root item').filter('[type="coffee"],[type="milk"],[type="sugar"]')
[03:23:43] <Torava> $('root').filter('item[type="coffee"],item[type="milk"],item[type="sugar"]')
[03:23:53] <Torava> i mean
[03:24:02] <Torava> * $('root').find('item[type...
[03:24:16] <Torava> filter looks prettier but it is much slower
[03:25:31] <Jahan> I just don't understand what is meant by the devs comment, file, must be setted. Did he mean file must be set?
[03:25:46] <VictorCL> anyone knows a good timer like   00:00:23
[03:27:33] <sahbeewah> filter calls find
[03:28:06] <sahbeewah> in fact, $('root') calls find as it is
[03:31:36] <donCams> does somebody have an idea how he changes the style here http://css3button.net/
[03:32:08] <donCams> i'm guessing ajax...
[03:33:09] <sahbeewah> what style?
[03:33:49] <donCams> the button. he changes it's style without adding inline styles
[03:36:48] <SugaSlide> donCams isnt it just creating a style thing on the page?
[03:37:09] <Blaster> is there a way to make an image spin in place in Jquery?
[03:37:16] <SugaSlide> like $(body).append("<style/>") etc
[03:38:12] <SugaSlide> whenever you change something style id="previewCSS" type="text/css"> changes
[03:38:27] <SugaSlide> @ donCams
[03:38:52] <timing_> Blaster: you can use css3 transformations or just use a animated gif
[03:39:19] <Blaster> i need a transparent background on the image and it has to work in IE
[03:39:27] <Blaster> do either of those options still work?
[03:39:46] <SugaSlide> animated gif is the best
[03:40:00] <Blaster> and which program would you use to make it?
[03:40:31] <SugaSlide> i just use http://www.ajaxload.info/
[03:40:33] <SugaSlide> lol
[03:40:41] <SugaSlide> made 1 in the past tho
[03:40:47] <SugaSlide> used flash and exported to gif
[03:42:18] <Ortund> how can I get a grandparent of $(this) ?
[03:42:31] <Ortund> $(this).parent().parent() ?
[03:42:32] <SugaSlide> closest
[03:42:42] <SugaSlide> that would work
[03:42:48] <Ortund> SugaSlide: I'm using closest, it's not working
[03:42:49] <Blaster> SugaSlide: What about this? http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/wiki/Examples
[03:42:51] <SugaSlide> or .closest("selector")
[03:43:07] <Ortund> imgID = $(this).closest('td').attr('id');           <<< doesn't work
[03:43:08] <Blaster> SugaSlide: Example 3
[03:43:21] <SugaSlide> cool
[03:43:36] <Blaster> think that's cross browser compliant?
[03:43:37] <SugaSlide> where is "this"
[03:43:48] <michaelbakonyi> hi
[03:44:04] <SugaSlide> Comment by benjamwe...@gmail.com, Apr 6, 2011
[03:44:05] <SugaSlide> perpetual rotating examples do not work in chrome
[03:44:18] <SugaSlide> read the comments
[03:45:18] <Ortund> SugaSlide: is that for me?
[03:45:30] <SugaSlide> i ahd like an hours sleep
[03:45:38] <michaelbakonyi> I've got a question regarding the not-chain: i want to select all a-tags in which the href contains .pdf as ending but I don't want hrefs which occur within an ul with class "uploads"
[03:45:39] <SugaSlide> whoever posted the link to rotating things
[03:45:45] <Ortund> oh
[03:45:54] <michaelbakonyi> this is what i tried: $('a[href$=".pdf"]').not(':has(img)',function(){
[03:45:54] <michaelbakonyi>                 $(this).parents('ul.uploads');
[03:45:54] <michaelbakonyi>                 }).addClass("pdf");
[03:45:55] <SugaSlide> Ortund what is this?
[03:46:03] <SugaSlide> pastie the function please
[03:46:08] <SugaSlide> and demo code of markup
[03:46:20] <michaelbakonyi> without success
[03:46:22] <Haprog> that rotation example works atleast in latest firefox, chrome and IE9. just tested
[03:46:34] <michaelbakonyi> if anybody could give me a hint that would be gread
[03:46:38] <michaelbakonyi> -d +t
[03:46:49] <Blaster> I noticed it had scroll bars in IE... Any idea of a quick fix?
[03:46:54] <Blaster> overflow:hidden in CSS or something?

[03:50:04] <SugaSlide> Ortund http://jsfiddle.net/z3sV4/
[03:50:16] <SugaSlide> soz just used markup i had lieing around
[03:51:15] <fris> risky_s something like $('input[name="myclass"]').attr('checked', false);
[03:51:48] <risky_s> i mean like assigning 1 to value if value='0'
[03:51:48] <fris> or in 1.6 and above jquery use prop
[03:51:53] <donCams> SugaSlide, thanks. i didn't see that style with the id
[03:52:08] <fris> well 1 would be true
[03:52:09] <michaelbakonyi> sry I forgot the pasting-rule, here's my code again: http://jsfiddle.net/qtLd7/

[03:54:36] <umesh> can any one help me i have some problem relateat to autocomplete
[03:54:38] <umesh> search
[03:55:56] <Guest20172> how can I turn the following js onclick event:  onSubmit="return validate(this);"  into a a jquery .live event?
[03:59:42] <Ortund> SugaSlide: it's not defined in the code I pasted, it's just another <img> tag on the page
[04:00:01] <SugaSlide> $("form").live("submit",function(){
[04:00:19] <SugaSlide> validate(this); });
[04:00:39] <inki> rather $('form').on()
[04:01:21] <SugaSlide> Ortund http://pastebin.com/Ydhey2nR
[04:01:22] <inki> live() is deprecated as of 1.7
[04:01:30] <SugaSlide> i dont see it..
[04:01:38] <SugaSlide> it is?
[04:01:40] <SugaSlide> bleh
[04:01:45] <SugaSlide> im using it at the mo :(
[04:01:53] <inki> it is.
[04:02:40] <inki> but it should be easy to migrate
[04:04:13] <vzlahagen> hi people :)
[04:04:30] <SugaSlide> oooooooo .on = bind and delegate in 1
[04:05:58] <dnsdds> Anybody responsible for jQUI docs, the "animation types" links at http://jqueryui.com/docs/Effects/Methods point to the non-existing http://jqueryui.com/docs/Types page, when they should in fact point to http://jqueryui.com/docs/Effects/Types
[04:05:59] <bot-t> (236 hours ago) <rworth> tell dnsdds see http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#side-scroll
[04:06:00] <dnsdds> Just sayin'
[04:06:15] <woozly_> how to run on all form's inputs and textareas and selects elements? and check if it checked/entered?
[04:07:07] <vzlahagen> question: imagine i am using some jquery plugin (like jcoverflip) http://tinyurl.com/y2hg2tc , if i destroy the element associated with it, it will destroy the jquery object right?
[04:11:16] <risky_s> hi
[04:11:38] <risky_s> i am trying to do a show/hide on a div based on the value of a yes and no radio buttons
[04:12:08] <risky_s> how do I test the value of the radio button
[04:12:08] <risky_s> ?
[04:16:24] <Blaster> how come in IE when I do fadeOut on a transparent png, the background of the image turns black as its fading out
[04:18:24] <Cork> Blaster: its a known problem in ie
[04:18:44] <Cork> Blaster: ie<9 can't do alpha calculations
[04:19:04] <Cork> so it can't calculate the opacity+alpha values so they turn black instead
[04:19:25] <Ortund> a self proclaimed witch on my facebook wall just posted saying "I am that which is taboo and must not be spoken of." ... First thing that popped into my head was "He is Voldemort."
[04:20:55] <Ukto> hah
[04:21:27] <beckyisabunny> hii~ is there a neater way of passing the element that triggered an event to a handler function than this? http://pastebin.com/v11UEEx2
[04:28:38] <Mech0z> Is there a list in Json other than an array like "var arrayToSend = [];"
[04:29:09] <Mech0z> when I send it as arraylist it just comes up as undefined:undefined for each object in my browser
[04:29:28] <Mech0z> but sending single objects from the arraylist is fine
[04:29:43] <Cork> beckyisabunny: why don't you just pass handleHiddenElementToggle as the function?
[04:30:17] <Cork> Mech0z: arrays doesn't have colons in them
[04:30:24] <Cork> thats objects
[04:30:50] <Mech0z> yes the objects in the list gives me undefiend : undefined
[04:31:03] <Mech0z> so if I have 5 objects in my list I get that 5 times
[04:31:08] <beckyisabunny> cork: when i tried that handleHiddenElementToggle couldn't find $(this). it didn't even work when i tried passing $(this) to it :x.
[04:31:57] <Cork> beckyisabunny: $('.hidden_element_toggle').on('change', handleHiddenElementToggle); should work fine
[04:32:05] <Cork> as long as you access the element though this
[04:32:14] <Mech0z> but is there no other type of list than arraylist?
[04:32:39] <Mech0z> I cant get my mvc 3 to read the array I send to it like this
[04:33:04] <Mech0z> if I send a single element then the action has no problem reading it
[04:33:53] <Cork> Mech0z: there is arrays thats [1,2,3,4,5] and theres objects thats {"key1":"val1","key2":"val2"}
[04:34:01] <Cork> Mech0z: there is no other collection in json
[04:34:32] <Cork> well arrays can be of the different variable types but its always comma separated values
[04:34:48] <Blaster> how would you get all the classes of an element in jquery
[04:35:09] <beckyisabunny> cork: thanks : ) i was trying to do it as either handleHiddenElementToggle(event) and then event.trigger or handleHiddenElementToggle($(this)) neither of which worked~ thank you!
[04:35:44] <Cork> Blaster: $(this).attr('class')
[04:36:59] <TimothyA1> anyone here knows how to convert a HTTP query string to a javascript array
[04:37:00] <TimothyA1> ?
[04:37:18] <Blaster> Cork: what if there are more than 1 class?
[04:37:34] <Cork> TimothyA1: why do you need that?
[04:38:01] <Cork> Blaster: class is the class attribute its a space separated string of names
[04:38:17] <TimothyA1> Cork: because I have to change an parameter in the query
[04:38:19] <Cork> Blaster: there should never be two class attributes on the same element
[04:38:27] <TimothyA1> regex doesn't seem the right way to me
[04:38:43] <Cork> TimothyA1: could you please explain the flow a bit
[04:38:55] <Cork> the reason i ask is you might be missing the real solution
[04:39:23] <Cork> so ex. where do you get the query string from?
[04:39:24] <TimothyA1> Cork: there is a search form which utilizes GET. and I have 2 form controls which set the items per page and order
[04:39:28] <Blaster> Cork:  But if it's like <a class="class1 class2">
[04:39:35] <Blaster> does it return both
[04:39:36] <Blaster> ?
[04:39:43] <Cork> Blaster: yes
[04:39:59] <Cork> TimothyA1: ok, so you want to mod the action attribute
[04:40:05] <Cork> then ya, regex is the only way
[04:40:16] <Cork> or...
[04:40:21] <Cork> there is the url class
[04:40:29] * Cork tries to remember its name...
[04:40:46] <TimothyA1> Cork: ...
[04:41:53] <Cork> hmm no it only does encoding/decoding
[04:42:00] <Cork> it doesn't split out its parts
[04:42:08] <Cork> so regex is the only solution
[04:46:46] <Aquaguy> Hello there, anyone knows any other code like jLinq?
[04:46:59] <timing_> what das jLinq do?
[04:48:43] <Aquaguy> timing_, manipulate objects with some sort of sql like methods
[04:53:55] <TimothyA1> Cork: jquery.deparam
[04:54:05] <pundit> where can i find a tutorial on smooth scrolling in inline links?
[04:54:23] <Cork> TimothyA1: thats a plugin right?
[04:54:39] <TimothyA1> yes
[04:54:45] * Cork nods
[04:56:52] <TimothyA1> Cork: https://github.com/allmarkedup/jQuery-URL-Parser this one as well
[05:30:27] <stuck_> hi there, i am wondering - if i have jquery loaded on a customer location, and my plugin is embedded as a div (which also loads jquery), would that cause problems?
[05:30:34] <stuck_> if so, are there any way to avoid that?
[05:31:17] <ndss56> what problems?
[05:31:34] <stuck_> that's what i am wondering, -would- it cause any problems?
[05:31:41] <stuck_> e.g. if the customer has a older jquery version loaded
[05:31:50] <stuck_> and my plugin then loads a newer one.
[05:32:18] <stuck_> we're talking 100+ customers that i am rolling out this update to next year, so just going over all aspects here
[05:32:25] <stuck_> to ensure that it won't cause any problems
[05:32:26] <stuck_> :P
[05:32:52] <erichynds> stuck_: make sure your plugin calls noConflict(true)
[05:34:02] <ndss56> stuck_: why don't you test it before rolling it out to all your customers?
[05:34:13] <stuck_> uhm, isn't that to avoid problems with other libraries like prototype?
[05:34:45] <erichynds> stuck_: it will return $ back to the first copy of jquery loaded on the page
[05:34:48] <stuck_> ndss56; of course it's tested, but with 100+ customers, you never know what kind of errors might occur
[05:34:48] <erichynds> to avoid conflicts.
[05:34:49] <stuck_> :P
[05:34:57] <erichynds> also
[05:35:00] <stuck_> ah
[05:35:03] <stuck_> that's brilliant
[05:35:06] <erichynds> behavior tests ftw
[05:36:21] <ndss56> stuck_: you might leave yourself open to security issues with out of date jquery.
[05:36:59] <stuck_> ndss56, yeah
[05:38:25] <stuck_> thanks guys, much appreaciated - i'll implement the noConflict approach, and see how that plays out
[05:40:14] <ndss56> stuck_: it will turn out bad.
[05:41:09] <Mech0z> When I use http://pastebin.com/3pZz3PJS it selects all my .si-accordion classes and toggles the class on its sibling, I only want it to toggle on the one inside the one I clicked on,
[05:42:02] <Zogot> Mech0z, show a jsfiddle, with some HTML so we get a better idea
[05:42:51] <simenbrekken> Is there any reason why $el.css('opacity', 'hide'); wouldn't work?
[05:42:52] <Segaja> Mech0z: if i understand you correctly you need to go into the clicked one like $(this).children('.accordion_tab')...
[05:42:57] <Mech0z> http://i41.tinypic.com/mai9z5.png
[05:43:02] <simenbrekken> Or do I have to explicitly use hide()?
[05:43:08] <Mech0z> Zogot:
[05:43:32] <Mech0z> the one market is in this example the one I click on and it has a class IsExpanded already
[05:43:59] <Segaja> and you want the class of the clicked element to toggle?
[05:44:05] <Mech0z> but if I click my code now it removes it from the market one (which is correct) but also toggles it on all the rest
[05:44:39] <Mech0z> I only want it to toggle for the sibling to the one I click
[05:45:28] <Segaja> Mech0z: the class si-accordion is on a <h3>
[05:45:37] <Segaja> your marked tag is a <div> parallel to the h3
[05:46:20] <Mech0z> what if I move the si-accordion to the div
[05:46:51] <Segaja> you want to click on the div and thereby toggle the IsExpanded class?
[05:47:01] <Mech0z> yes
[05:47:05] <Mech0z> but only for that single div
[05:47:32] <soahccc> Is there a way to use the each method with passed values? means .each(function (index, value) {})
[05:47:48] <Segaja> then use $('.accordion_tab').click(function() { $(this).toggleClass('IsExpanded'); });
[05:48:06] <Segaja> that will toggle the IsExpanded class on any accordion_tab you click
[05:50:40] <Segaja> soahccc: i don't know what you mean
[05:50:57] <pgherveou> hi guys I am working with template, and just realised that the has function does not work for element that have not been added to the dom yet, are there some easy work around ?
[05:51:51] <Mech0z> segaja nothing happens not if si-accordion is on the h3 or the div, no result from either
[05:51:52] <edgardo> pgherveou, couldn't you just place it there and hide it ?
[05:52:05] <Segaja> Mech0z: did you use my code?
[05:52:14] <Mech0z> Segaja: yes
[05:52:22] <Mech0z> $('.accordion_tab').click(function() {             $(this).toggleClass('IsExpanded');         });
[05:52:43] <Segaja> and does firebug show the toggling works?
[05:53:01] <beasty> Segaja: yes
[05:53:02] <Mech0z> no, no classes are changed
[05:53:14] <pgherveou> wont be easy cause I am generating the page from template on client side , but acually I found another way to filter it, its weird generaly you can pass a cxt as a second arg on jquery function but not with .has
[05:53:19] <Segaja> beasty: what?
[05:53:30] <Segaja> Mech0z: as mentioned before make a jsfiddle example
[05:54:00] <Segaja> pgherveou: if you have the tags in a variable can't you use $(myVar).has(...) ?
[05:54:17] <pgherveou> thats what I did
[05:54:27] <Segaja> hm
[05:54:33] <pgherveou> but it looked like its only working for el in dom
[05:54:35] <soahccc> Segaja: I have no idea how to access the element in line 63 --> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/jiyv6edtctlnk63iqcnbw
[05:55:04] <pgherveou> I used the .parent() instead to filter stuff its not has elegant but it work in my case
[05:55:20] <seutje> soahccc: what do u mean? ur accessing it right now o.O
[05:55:21] <Mech0z> Segaja: thats hard when most alot of it is dynamic :s
[05:56:01] <Segaja> Mech0z: but necessary if you wan't help. from the picture you gave us, my code should work
[05:56:16] <Segaja> soahccc: i don't see your problem. where do you want to access which variable?
[05:56:31] <soahccc> seutje: rbind is a self defined method (see line 13)... So this is not the element
[05:56:39] <Mech0z> Segaja:  http://jsfiddle.net/nWK8L/
[05:56:39] <soahccc> I always get the index in el
[05:56:42] <aro> i have a question about css scope with jquery ui - can you use different themes in nested elements?
[05:57:02] <soahccc> seutje: Sorry, I mean Segaja =)
[05:57:10] <seutje> that's coz the handler for each has 2 parameters
[05:57:16] <seutje> index and element, in that order
[05:57:40] <seutje> alternatively, u could use this as a reference to the element in the current iteration
[05:58:01] <soahccc> Segaja: So is there any possibility to get the element if the this-scope has be changed?
[05:58:05] <Mech0z> Segaja: does that make sense?
[05:58:08] <Segaja> soahccc: http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:58:28] <seutje> screw this, feel like I'm talking to a wall again :/
[05:58:30] <Segaja> soahccc: as seutje said. var.each(function(index, element) { ... });
[05:59:07] <Segaja> Mech0z: not really
[05:59:22] <soahccc> Ohh I see... I missed that somehow :( Thanks
[05:59:50] <aro> basically - i have an accordion element, and id like an element with a different theme inside it. Is that doable?
[06:00:30] <Mech0z> Segaja: http://jsfiddle.net/nWK8L/1/
[06:01:33] <Segaja> Mech0z: why don't you use the jQuery UI accordion?
[06:02:06] <aro> i AM using jquery accordion
[06:02:10] <Mech0z> Segaja: I dont know :o we have a css guy working on it atm, it will be cleaned later
[06:02:34] <Segaja> aro: i didn't talked to you
[06:02:42] <Segaja> Mech0z: i see the problem now, give me a sex
[06:02:43] <Segaja> sec
[06:02:54] <diverdud`> hehehe
[06:03:01] <diverdud`> nasty
[06:06:14] <keybo> i'm sending multiple elements to print sequentially, is there a way to stop firefox from giving the message of 'Prevent this page from opening additional dialogues' ?
[06:06:38] <Mech0z> Segaja: the @cls is the IsExpanded which I read from my database when I load teh page if your in doubt
[06:06:50] <Oldgram> Hello! :-) if I call $(function1) and there later $(function2), can I be sure that after page is loaded, *first* function1 will be called and only *after* that function2 will? the same if i bind a click twice? (el.click(function3) and later el.click(function4) - a click will trigger function3 *first* for sure?) thanks a lot! :-)
[06:06:53] <Mech0z> so its either "IsExpanded" or ""
[06:07:04] <Segaja> Mech0z: $('h3.accordion_header > a').click(function() { $(this).parent().next().toggleClass('IsExpanded'); });
[06:07:39] <erichynds> Oldgram: yes, handlers are fired in the order in which they are bound. but if you're doing any async logic in the handler, you can't guarantee that handler1 will finish before handler2.
[06:07:51] <Segaja> Mech0z: this _should_ work
[06:07:58] <Mech0z> trying
[06:08:22] <Tomashe> there is a way to make colorbox open image like $("img").colorbox() < this isnt working
[06:08:38] <Mech0z> Segaja:  it works :) what does the > 3 do?
[06:08:47] <Mech0z> > a *
[06:08:48] <hsbot>   <hint>:1:4: parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
[06:09:08] <pojo> i was using  this code snippet http://jsfiddle.net/Fzqe6/. I was wondering how the a and b values are passed to the function
[06:09:56] <Oldgram> erichynds, great, thanks!!
[06:10:12] <Segaja> Mech0z: h3.accordion_header > a   matches all links which are direct children of a h3 element with the class accordion_header
[06:11:26] <Mech0z> okay
[06:11:52] <Tomashe> ?
[06:14:43] <JAAulde> g'morning jQuerians
[06:14:50] <erichynds> yo dawg
[06:16:34] <seutje> sup ma nizzle!
[06:17:43] <dr0id> moin mootools'ers
[06:19:35] <JAAulde> mmmmmmmoooOOOOO
[06:24:51] <SugaSlide> cheers.. time to go die
[06:25:00] <edgardo> i've declared two elemenets as variables: "result = $('.result');" and clear = "$('#clear');" .. now, if I'd want to hide them both, normally I would say "$('.result, #clear').hide();" right? But how would I do this with the variables? "result,clear.hide();" or "result.clear.hide();" doesn't work
[06:25:48] <JAAulde> edgardo: they are separate collections, so you need to act on them separately: `result.hide(); clear.hide();`
[06:25:49] <dr0id> may you die in peace
[06:25:51] <edgardo> I mean hide them both in one line, I could just do separate ones
[06:25:57] <edgardo> ok :)
[06:26:16] <JAAulde> or you could create a third collection which contains the two, but that's really overkill.
[06:26:51] <Nomikos> What do I google for when I want to know more about the deal with #hash "bookmarks" in dynamic pages?
[06:27:18] <erichynds> hash history?
[06:27:40] <Tomashe> how do i point to img and no link when i use colorbox
[06:27:47] <Tomashe> when i put it at image its not working
[06:28:29] <DZ_> any1: how can i return a non jquery object version of a form element I've selected (just the plain DOM representation of a form element).  I'
[06:28:44] <robin_sz> so to select the last item from a <li> list > would do $('#myList ol li:last').blah() ... how should I select the third item?
[06:29:06] <dr0id> [0]
[06:29:10] <DZ_> I'm trying to hack some jquery into some really old code without rewriting all of it, I've selected a form element using a jquery selector, but the method I need to pass it to is expecting just a plain old DOM style element
[06:29:17] <erichynds> robin_sz: eq(2)
[06:29:26] <robin_sz> DZ_,  $('#myItem").html()
[06:29:34] <DZ_> thx robin
[06:29:56] <Mkop> huh? doesn't .html() return the html string?
[06:30:05] <Mkop> I assume he wants $("#myItem")[0]
[06:30:16] <robin_sz> I assumed he wanted the html
[06:30:25] <DZ_> oh sorry
[06:30:31] <DZ_> no i want the DOM representation of it
[06:30:31] <dr0id> heh
[06:30:40] <robin_sz> ah right, then what he said
[06:30:41] <DZ_> as if i selected like 'document.forms[0].somelem'
[06:31:38] <DZ_> thx guys that worked
[06:32:13] <robin_sz> erichynds, as in "#foo ol li:eq(2)" as the selector?
[06:32:27] <erichynds> robin_sz: yes, but I would use the eq() method and not the pseduo selector
[06:32:28] <erichynds> it's faster
[06:32:43] <robin_sz> ah, right got it
[06:34:09] <DanGer> when I have a form, with an submit button, which has an onclick="myfunc();" event, why is the form actually being submitted ending up with a page refresh?
[06:34:32] <DanGer> in myfunc() I just have a $.post() call
[06:40:35] <JAAulde> ugh, man.  wrote a large JS app using jQuery and jQuery UI. I took into account as much as I have read and understood for JS and DOM performance, and it's rockin' in every browser but IE. In IE it works fine, it just causes a ton of blocking and slow interactions.
[06:40:46] <JAAulde> ^^not a call for help, just a vent. I can't even show it to anyone to  get advice
[06:40:53] <beasty> mm
[06:40:56] <beasty> this is weird
[06:42:36] <beasty> http://pastebin.com/xP922g3g <= one time it parses perfect ... the other time it's something else
[06:42:39] <beasty> any idea ?
[06:43:53] <JAAulde> beasty: define "something else"
[06:44:48] <beasty> JAAulde: well somthimes it contains shown: 1
[06:44:56] <beasty> and not the complete list
[06:45:17] <kez> hi
[06:45:33] <kez> I want to prevent some inputs to be sent via POST on form submit
[06:45:40] <kez> I disabled the inputs but they are still sending..
[06:45:48] <kez> what am I missing ?
[06:45:51] <eightfold> i want to use jquery inside a colorbox (lightbox variant). the colorbox works using http://pastebin.com/Gb4KbZbQ, but not the inline jquery code within it. from what i understand i should use an onComplete.  but, using this: http://pastebin.com/H0EAG5U0 , the colorbox doesn't work.  ideas?
[06:46:39] <JAAulde> kez, in what manner did you disable them?
[06:46:57] <kez> attr('disabled','disabled')
[06:47:25] <kez> I checked the markup , they are disabled..
[06:47:34] <kez> so yeah , its weird
[06:47:51] <Nomikos> you could set the name values to '', while setting the attrs (granted, not the most elegant, but it should work)
[06:48:08] <kez> oh wait
[06:48:09] <JAAulde> beasty: can you make a jsFiddle with markup and code showing your problem?
[06:48:10] <kez> i'm stupid
[06:48:30] <kez> I think i've set the attribute to the wrong tag oups :D
[06:48:35] <Nomikos> heh
[06:48:35] <JAAulde> heh
[06:48:39] <kez> :D
[06:48:47] <kez> thanks anyway :)
[06:48:52] <kez> I love the jquery community
[06:48:55] <kez> always helpful
[06:49:17] <JAAulde> kez: you should also look into .prop() http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[06:49:29] <JAAulde> search on the word "disabled" and read it
[06:49:43] <JAAulde> I believe it will be more reliable
[06:50:10] <kez> 1.6...
[06:50:11] <kez> I think i'm still on 1.4
[06:50:44] <kez> nope , 1.6, will give it a try
[06:50:45] <eightfold> sorry, but i'll shorten my question. anything wrong with this: http://pastebin.com/H0EAG5U0 ?
[06:51:36] <JAAulde> beasty: http://jsfiddle.net/wKk3A/ is this ismilar to your setup? if so, it seems to work
[06:51:56] <JAAulde> eightfold: I am not familiar with colorbox, sorry
[06:52:40] <eightfold> JAAulde: nothing to be sorry for, mostly problems for me right now :)
[06:52:53] <Kagetsuki> hello, I wrote a plugin but I realized I need to be able to get output from it (which would essentailly kill chainability). It's basically an auto suggest plugin and I want to get the last word that was selected
[06:53:06] <Gavrisimo> Hello, could someone tell me how should i start debugging "jQuery validate" plugin which is not working for me in IE(6-9)? Basically everything works except form submiting, i.e. when i click on submit button nothing happens in IE, but it is working in other browsers. I am using 1.9 version of jqvalidate and have tested it with different versions of jq but nothing helped. I am not getting any error in console when i am using develope
[06:53:12] <Kagetsuki> best practice here is to have the user define a callback function?
[06:54:12] <JAAulde> Kagetsuki: there's a lot of unknowns in your question, but you could either trigger a custom event on the element which other things could subscribe to, or yes, you could allow for the provision of a callback in the options
[06:54:26] <JAAulde> I prefer the event methodology
[06:54:52] <Kagetsuki> JAAulde: aah, that is interesting
[06:55:50] <Kagetsuki> I made it do $(element).myPlugin("last") which would return the last selection but as soon as I did that I realized there was something wrong with it
[06:56:01] <Kagetsuki> *stylistically wrong
[06:56:25] <Kagetsuki> the custom event would have some other benefits as well, I'll do that
[06:56:36] <Kagetsuki> thanks!
[06:56:36] <JAAulde> brb: $( '#JAAulde' ).find( '#digestive > .lower' ).empty();
[06:57:01] <Kagetsuki> JAAulde: eew
[06:57:41] <Aamir> ?down https://addons.mozilla.org
[06:57:58] <Tomashe> guys common
[07:01:53] <Slartibart> Any common ptifalls that would make .show() fail? I'm trying to show a div with position absolute, display none and size css attached to it. But show seems to always end animatinglong before it should, like when the div is 10px wide even though css says it should be 50..
[07:02:05] <beasty> JAAulde: i wish i could
[07:02:26] <jeffsmykil> is delete Foo[0]; enough to delete an entry from an object?
[07:03:08] <JAAulde> am back.  Kagetsuki: hehehe
[07:03:17] <JAAulde> beasty: I posted a link for you...
[07:03:27] <JAAulde> bah, off to a meeting. bbiab
[07:03:31] <beasty> ah didn't see that
[07:03:39] <jeffsmykil> I can't seem to get it to work, but that;'s how my JS book says to do it
[07:03:56] <kez> anyone familiar with OOP in javascript ?
[07:04:34] <bitbit> Error: Permission denied to access property 'jquery'
[07:04:35] <bitbit> Source file: chrome://wisestamp/content/scriptloader.js
[07:04:35] <bitbit> Line: 183
[07:04:38] <bitbit> sorry
[07:04:58] <bitbit> was supposed to be one line, anyone ever heard of this error?
[07:05:15] <kez> I have obj X with method a, b  and c , now I call X.a from either X.b or X.c , how can I find out from X.a from what method I'm coming from ?
[07:05:31] <beasty> JAAulde: check this
[07:05:52] <beasty> JAAulde: add a apCur['Foo2'].shown = 1;  under the console.log
[07:06:51] <Kagetsuki> JAAulde: implemented, that looks much cleaner!
[07:07:15] <kez> anyone pls ?
[07:07:48] <jeffsmykil> how do i delete an item from an object?
[07:08:40] <bjensen> lets say I have a form that has been loaded in using ajax..I would like to watch for changes on this form, like if a user select yes on a radio box then specific elements will be shown. When the form is unloaded how can I make sure that query no longer looks for the changes on the form that is now gone?
[07:10:05] <Kagetsuki> jeffsmykil: you want to explicitly delete a variable or something?
[07:10:12] <Slartibart> bjensen: You unbind the function(s) that were looking for changes.
[07:10:16] <jeffsmykil> i actually want to move it
[07:10:24] <jeffsmykil> but ill settle for deleting it then adding it
[07:10:43] <Kagetsuki> well you can copy it and then set the origin to null
[07:11:28] <kez> jeffsmykil: you can treat an object any way you want , create attributes / methods on the fly
[07:11:29] <Kagetsuki> the javascript engine will remove it on its own... maybe... depends on scope really
[07:11:42] <kez> myobj.my_new_attribute = myobj.already_existent_attribute
[07:12:42] <jeffsmykil> yeah objects have given me trouble so im trying to understand
[07:15:14] <jeffsmykil> kez:  this is what my object looks like
[07:15:14] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/9Tt3tVF4
[07:15:50] <kez> you navigate through it like this : object.gutter.Item.ItemId
[07:15:52] <kez> for example
[07:15:57] <Kagetsuki> kez: calling object methods externally is a pain, you can only call functions defined in a function from within that function, variables on the other hand are accessable externally
[07:15:58] <kez> its basically very naturale
[07:16:00] <kez> natural
[07:16:17] <kez> Kagetsuki: from the same object that is
[07:16:26] <Kagetsuki> var whatever = function(args) { stuff }
[07:16:35] <Kagetsuki> aah, so you are using the syntax I just wrote
[07:16:35] <Spadeski> Hey may anyone pro with Jquery UI allow me to pm them a questions ?
[07:16:39] <kez> I want know if there is some magic method available to find from what method I've called another method :D
[07:16:43] <Kagetsuki> this.whatever(blah)
[07:16:51] <Kagetsuki> oh
[07:16:52] <kez> no args though
[07:16:58] <kez> want to make as abstract as possible
[07:17:33] <Kagetsuki> kez: I don't think you could trace so easily without leaving some sort of history intentionally
[07:18:19] <Kagetsuki> also, if you haven't checked out CoffeeScript yet it gets rid of so much of the annoying JS quirks it will make you hate raw JS
[07:18:30] <kez> I havent
[07:18:35] <kez> but I really love the OOP models in js
[07:18:39] <Kagetsuki> I don't ever want to write JS objects again
[07:18:42] <Kagetsuki> .... really!?
[07:18:44] <Kagetsuki> wow
[07:18:44] <Kagetsuki> ok
[07:18:51] <kez> :)
[07:19:11] <kez> they feel much more natural than lets say java
[07:19:41] <Kagetsuki> kez: http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#classes
[07:20:10] <Kagetsuki> well Java makes you do everything in such a padded-room style object model it's painful
[07:21:06] <jeffsmykil> kez ill give it a try
[07:21:20] <kez> wow Kagetsuki  , I like what I'm seeing
[07:22:28] <jeffsmykil> so kez in theory delete GridLayout.gutter[0]; should work?
[07:23:30] <kez> yep jeffsmykil
[07:23:39] <jeffsmykil> shoot
[07:23:43] <jeffsmykil> because it isn't
[07:23:57] <adz> for the jquery validate plugin, is there any way to create a rule for a css selector. for example: groups: { 			accreditation: $.getNames($('input:[name~=accreditation_points]')) 		},
[07:24:16] <kez> delete GridLayout.gutter
[07:24:42] <kez> do a console.log(GridLayout.gutter)
[07:24:43] <jeffsmykil> yeah that works
[07:24:54] <jeffsmykil> but if i want to delete something in the gutter
[07:25:00] <jeffsmykil> that's where i run into problems
[07:25:58] <adz> in other words, how do I validate large arrays of fields (in this case I would have say 1-100 fields called something[accreditation_points][index]
[07:26:02] <adz> )
[07:26:08] <JAAulde> .me is back
[07:26:11] <Kagetsuki> kez: CoffeeScript takes a bit to get used to but it's pretty nice. Some things in it are overly-new-wave though, like "for" loops
[07:26:14] <JAAulde>  / me, even
[07:26:21] <kez> console.log(GridLayout.gutter.prop_name)
[07:26:27] <beasty> JAAulde: ok you've seen it ?
[07:26:30] <kez> delete GridLayout.gutter.prop_name
[07:26:34] <JAAulde> beasty: no
[07:26:44] <jeffsmykil> kez sorry not trying to be difficult, appreciate your help
[07:26:58] <beasty> JAAulde: add a apCur['Foo2'].shown = 1;  under the console.log
[07:27:21] <JAAulde> beasty: on the fiddle I linked?
[07:27:26] <beasty> JAAulde: yes
[07:28:08] <JAAulde> beasty: ok...I did
[07:28:14] <beasty> no see the output
[07:28:25] <beasty> s/no/now/
[07:28:29] <JAAulde> I need you to be more specific here...what should I see...
[07:28:47] <beasty> the foo2 has a shown=1 instead of a shown=0
[07:28:55] <JAAulde> right, as it should
[07:29:19] <beasty> mm
[07:29:24] <beasty> think i'm missing some logic
[07:29:27] <beasty> please do explain
[07:29:35] <JAAulde> you set it to 1...so it shows 1
[07:29:40] <beasty> yes
[07:29:46] <JAAulde> are you confused that the console log happens before the value change
[07:29:47] <beasty> but under the console.log()
[07:29:50] <JAAulde> but the log still shows 1?
[07:29:56] <adz> does anyone know of a validation plugin that validates through selectors
[07:30:07] <JAAulde> you are logging an object, which is really a referenc eot the object
[07:30:21] <beasty> ok
[07:30:31] <beasty> that kinda makes sense
[07:30:38] <JAAulde> so when you open it in the console, the reference looks to the real object for the value
[07:30:40] <JAAulde> whic has been changed
[07:30:58] <beasty> hmm ok
[07:31:16] <beasty> maybe i should use something else then
[07:32:13] <beasty> JAAulde: maybe i should paste you the entire function
[07:32:15] <beasty> hang on
[07:33:23] <beasty> JAAulde: and maybe give your idea about it
[07:33:26] <beasty> and oh hi sean` :p
[07:33:31] <beasty> my dutch friend :p
[07:33:50] <JAAulde> beasty: http://jsfiddle.net/wKk3A/4/
[07:34:02] <JAAulde> notice when we directly log the property in question, you see what you expect
[07:34:43] <sean`> yo yobeasty
[07:34:58] <beasty> sean`: havent seen you in a while
[07:36:37] <beasty> JAAulde: http://pastebin.com/JS3mR1F0
[07:37:36] <JAAulde> beasty: if your concern with what you posted is the output in console, the answer is the same
[07:37:46] <jeffsmykil> when you delete from an object the index number doesn't shift down?
[07:38:04] <JAAulde> If you want to see things as the progress, you should probably se a script debugger and step through the functionality
[07:38:20] <JAAulde> jeffsmykil: objects don't have index numbers
[07:38:34] <beasty> JAAulde: yes but it makes weird hops
[07:38:48] <jeffsmykil> but the arrays in them do?
[07:38:49] <JAAulde> jeffsmykil:  if you delete object property which happens to have numeric names, no, JS will not rename the other properties
[07:39:17] <jeffsmykil> if i have
[07:39:18] <jeffsmykil> console.log(GridLayout.gutter[1])
[07:39:20] <JAAulde> jeffsmykil: some Array manipulations functions will renumber the array, tohers do not
[07:39:28] <jeffsmykil> and then i delete console.log(GridLayout.gutter[0])
[07:39:39] <jeffsmykil> it doesnt make 1 the new 0
[07:40:16] <JAAulde> jeffsmykil: correct
[07:40:32] <JAAulde> delete does not cause array re-ordering
[07:40:40] <jeffsmykil> is there a command that does?
[07:40:57] <JAAulde> beasty: regardless, but the time you start poking around at the values in console, the script is done executing and the object to which the console point will be holding the information as represented at the end of your script
[07:41:33] <beasty> ok
[07:41:40] <JAAulde> jeffsmykil: Array.prototype.shift() will remove the first, and adjust the erst
[07:41:46] <risky_s> I am using a value for a placeholder for textarea
[07:42:03] <JAAulde> jeffsmykil: I think Array.prototype.splice() will adjust array order too
[07:42:05] <risky_s> however my jquery clears the box when clicked on so i cant allow for edit
[07:42:09] <risky_s> how do I prevent this?
[07:42:13] <JAAulde> jeffsmykil: see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
[07:42:20] <jeffsmykil> ah didnt know you could splice an object
[07:42:54] <JAAulde> jeffsmykil: well, if you're dealing with a non Array object, you can't
[07:43:00] <JAAulde> short of .call()
[07:43:30] <JAAulde> It is hard for me given your terminology and code samples t know what you're actually doing with what
[07:43:40] <Xotix> Someone using datatables?
[07:45:00] <JAAulde> Xotix: someone, some where...
[07:45:08] <risky_s> anyone?
[07:45:44] <JAAulde> risky_s: there is no way to possibly know what's going on without seeing code
[07:46:10] <risky_s> due to the sensitive nature of the work I cant actually post cod
[07:46:12] <risky_s> code*
[07:46:23] <JAAulde> risky_s: I completely understand.  But we cannot help.
[07:46:31] <risky_s> i basically have a focus function on textarea
[07:47:01] <risky_s> $(textarea).focus{ $(this).val(' ')}
[07:47:11] <JAAulde> ah, so you want the initial clearing, but no clearing after someone has entered a value
[07:47:20] <risky_s> yep
[07:47:34] <risky_s> when I clickout it has a blur to revert to a previous bground
[07:48:20] <JAAulde> risky_s: google around for "jquery input placeholder" http://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+input+placeholder
[07:48:41] <JAAulde> risky_s: html5 offers a placeholder attr for such purposes, and people have written jQuery shims for it
[07:48:53] <risky_s> problem is they don't work for ie8
[07:49:47] <JAAulde> risky_s: thus the recommendation of a jQuery shim...
[07:50:17] <JAAulde> to "shim" in web development is to write code which provides modern browser functioanlity in odler browsers
[07:50:31] <JAAulde> s/odler/older/
[07:50:54] <diverdud`> JAAulde: yes so a component will be installed in older browsers so they can understand new html5 and css3 right?
[07:51:24] <JAAulde> diverdud`: correct. and a properly written shim will detect if the support is already there and will not add any further support
[07:51:53] <diverdud`> JAAulde: what is shim short for?
[07:52:02] <beasty> there i fixed it :)
[07:52:09] <JAAulde> it's a reference to the small pieces of wood used in construction to fill gaps
[07:52:13] <JAAulde> diverdud`: ^^
[07:52:19] <diverdud`> ohh hehehe nice :)
[07:52:39] <JAAulde> beasty: oh?
[07:52:39] <linodator> exir
[07:52:48] <diverdud`> JAAulde: but...hmm can you write a shim? isn't it just if(oldbrowser) install_shim(); ?
[07:53:53] <JAAulde> diverdud`: browser sniffing is not the preferred way of determining if the bahavior should be added.  Look at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/ as well as things like http://yepnopejs.com/
[07:54:58] <diverdud`> JAAulde: i was considering using modernizr for that actually
[07:55:05] <JAAulde> diverdud`: excellent
[07:55:27] <diverdud`> JAAulde: but still i need to learn exactly what modernizr is and how it works
[07:55:49] <JAAulde> diverdud`: true. the never ending learning curve :)
[07:56:45] <diverdud`> JAAulde: ohhh yes...im learning cakephp and loads of plugins for that...jquery,css3,html5(boiler plate),modernizer, twig and more
[07:57:20] <diverdud`> JAAulde: it takes a helluva time to get everything in order the way i want it and understand it
[07:59:30] <JAAulde> diverdud`: yeah, there's a lot there.  I find it fun, though, to learn and play with it all
[08:00:13] <diverdud`> JAAulde: yes it is fun....but i also just want to have a site up and running soon
[08:00:22] <JAAulde> understood
[08:01:46] <JAAulde> ok, gotta roll.  have a massive IE performance issue to figure out.  Peace!
[08:04:32] * beasty does a happy dance
[08:06:12] <Blaster> how would you see if an element has a specific parent?
[08:07:07] <monk12> So quick question, does jquery on ready fire when clicking the Back button. was just reading how FF has bfcache that doesn't run onLoad (but will run pageshow event when user using b/f buttons)
[08:11:59] <monk12> nvm, confirmed in FF that document.ready doesnt fire on Back button
[08:12:04] <FoolsRun> Hi, everyone. I have a unique issue that I'm hpoing someone can shed some light on. I'm using checkboxes to hide and unhide elements on a page, and I'm using a "group" checkbox to hide/unhide groups of these elements as well. I'm using a .trigger() for this. Problem is that my if all but one of the checkboxes are unchecked, and I use the group checkbox to check them all, the trigger makes the already-checked box trigger aga
[08:12:46] <FoolsRun> I need to be able to trigger only checkboxes that are in a state different from the "group" checkbox.
[08:12:57] <FoolsRun> I can show you the code I have now
[08:15:31] <monk12> FoolsRun, Put it on jsfiddle.net for us to see whats going on.
[08:16:36] <FoolsRun> monk12: it's just a snippet of a much larger thing --would pastebin be ok so that I don't have to re-create my whole page here? :)
[08:16:56] <FoolsRun> It's one line. Should be pretty straight forward, I'm just not very good with js
[08:17:47] <monk12> ok.
[08:17:51] <monk12> send it over.
[08:17:56] <tp43> any recommendations for ajax uploading?
[08:18:29] <FoolsRun> http://pastebin.com/WihtxTuj
[08:18:57] <FoolsRun> actually, ignore that one
[08:19:17] <FoolsRun> here:  http://pastebin.com/UCaaHn4V
[08:22:00] <FoolsRun> monk12: does what I'm trying to do make sense? Like, do you understand the goal?
[08:25:06] <monk12> looking FoolsRun
[08:26:40] <FoolsRun> monk12: the bug only presents when a single (or more) checkboxes are checked, and then the group is checked. Undoing somethign twice is no problem; doing something twice is :)
[08:27:40] <monk12> so why does it matter if it gets called twice... if that subelement is checked then it hides something... its action is to hide... so it just tries to hide something again which would be harmless right?
[08:28:02] <monk12> so the 'check all' wouldn't hurt by triggering those checkboxes?
[08:28:31] <FoolsRun> monk12: right, the problem is when it unhides. It's triggering a function that shows a calendar on a page, and triggering it a second time shows the calendar a second time.
[08:28:54] <monk12> ok let me think.
[08:29:35] <FoolsRun> Basically I need to say ".trigger(change) any checkboxes in the fieldset that aren't in the new state of this master checkbox"
[08:31:59] <Aric> I can't seem to use the jQuery.validate plugin or is this depreciated now that jQuery 1.7 does it builtin?  I'm getting event.layerX and undefined 'call' errors whenever I include the jquery.validate.js
[08:33:03] <monk12> FoolsRun. There is a way to store information about each DOM element. almost like storage, you could set a variable maybe if its already been done. but i feel this is inefficient maybe. let me ponder on it, see if anyone else responds.
[08:33:33] <monk12> at worst can store its id in an array. if in_array, then its already been done, dont do it
[08:33:39] <monk12> more ghetto, but easier to understand
[08:34:17] <FoolsRun> monk12: sure thing. It seems like there should be a nice little inline addendum to "find" that would tell me whether the found object is in the same checked/unchecked state as this.checked
[08:36:26] <monk12> could you do this psuedo-code: //For checkboxes that are NOT checked yet, do stuff (hide stuff?) //Now check all checkboxes, so user has feedback all has been done.
[08:37:34] <FoolsRun> monk12: you mean manually fire off the hide function and then just check the checkbox to make it pretty?
[08:37:45] <monk12> (because you only trying to do work when they click the check-all button, for checkboxes that haven't been checked yet.)
[08:38:28] <monk12> You could trigger the change event for those unchecked checkboxes.... then yeh, just make it 'pretty'.
[08:38:55] <monk12> or do what that trigger does, in your main function. not sure what is 'best' way to approach
[08:39:20] <FoolsRun> I could have two functions,one for check and one for uncheck...
[08:39:26] <andrew9183> hey guys, i have a link inside a div of a div of a div.  and i want to bind to the link but need the id of the highest div, is it proper to be doing parent().parent().parent().parent() etc ?
[08:39:29] <andrew9183> or is there a better way ?
[08:39:43] <FoolsRun> then I woudln't ahve to figure out how the state of the checkboxes relates to the state of the master checkbox
[08:40:06] <diverdud`> andrew9183: find first
[08:40:24] <monk12> andrew9183,  isnt there a way to find highest parent thats a 'div' pretend. think its .parent('div') or .parents('div')
[08:40:25] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: .parents('div:first')
[08:40:39] <Eviltwin> Err, .parents('div:last')
[08:40:44] <Eviltwin> It's the immediate parent first
[08:40:50] <andrew9183> ah okay, thanks
[08:40:54] <andrew9183> saves me from writing bad code
[08:40:57] <andrew9183> thank you!
[08:41:27] <Eviltwin> The reason there's not a shortcut for going up N ancestors is because it's usually not a good idea
[08:45:36] <monk12> FoolsRun, so you think your good now?
[08:45:52] <FoolsRun> monk12: I've got something to try at least. That's progress :)
[08:48:37] <HardPhuck> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'anythingSlider'
[08:48:41] <HardPhuck> I have included jQuery
[08:48:47] <HardPhuck> and anythingslider as well
[08:48:58] <HardPhuck> both javascript files are loaded
[08:49:01] <HardPhuck> no other library
[08:50:52] <HardPhuck> nvm, my fault :)
[08:51:38] <FoolsRun> monk12: got it working. Do you care to see the result?
[08:51:44] <monk12> sure
[08:52:12] <FoolsRun> http://pastebin.com/hS4cpSiX
[08:55:03] <monk12> cool looks good.
[08:55:46] <FoolsRun> monk12: it still technically double-hides, but that's okay
[08:56:53] <webadpro__> Hi
[08:57:06] <webadpro__> Is it just me or datepicker the create event is not working?
[08:57:31] <FoolsRun> monk12: thanks for your help!
[08:57:33] <monk12> sure.
[08:57:51] <monk12> what do you mean, the example is not working on the jQueryUI DatePicker page?
[08:57:56] <monk12> webadpro__, ^
[08:58:17] <webadpro__> monk12: well the create event does not fire
[08:58:48] <webadpro__> http://jsfiddle.net/jgarrido/u5rfc/
[08:59:02] <monk12> what version?: issue: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6935
[08:59:27] <webadpro__> monk12: latest version.
[08:59:32] <webadpro__> Just downloaded yesterday
[09:00:45] <monk12> well that ticket is updated 4 days ago.
[09:00:52] <monk12> so assume its still a bug.
[09:01:24] <webadpro__> right.
[09:01:30] <webadpro__> thanks
[09:03:20] <sphinxxx> does anyone know whats wrong with the supersized plugin on this page?  when you make the window smaller, its zooming into the image, i've never seen that before with supersized: https://opensky.com/p/kjlgiveaway
[09:05:04] <monk12> Anyway know if this is still valid: http://stackoverflow.com/a/201406  When i click the back button in FF, it doesn't do anything in document.ready ... example: http://pastebin.com/x4t9r5gu
[09:07:59] <Eviltwin> monk12: Frequently browsers save the entire state of the page for a short version of the browser history
[09:08:04] <Eviltwin> Including the JavaScript state
[09:12:50] <MeXTuX> Does anybody know about a nice JQuery calendar??? A calendar that can work without AJAX :D
[09:15:35] <SataNix> MeXTuX: Like a datepicker?
[09:16:04] <MeXTuX> MMmm more like an event calendar
[09:16:24] <MeXTuX> But I really need it to work without Ajax
[09:16:56] <SataNix> I can't see how AJAX should be necessary in the first place.
[09:17:10] <SataNix> But I have no good ideas for you. Sorry. :(
[09:17:32] <john> MeXTuX: full calendar is pretty good
[09:18:08] <MeXTuX> Some calendars load events on the fly but I'm working on a project using a CASE tool called GeneXu and use AJAX is a headache
[09:18:17] <MeXTuX> GeneXus
[09:18:50] <SataNix> The name alone gives me a headache!
[09:19:42] <MeXTuX> You only feed a knowledge base with the entities and it codes for you
[09:19:54] <MeXTuX> but it i really limited
[09:20:36] <MeXTuX> adding javascript is a real adventure
[09:23:05] <diminoten> is there a way to figure out what's going wrong with a get()?
[09:23:21] <diminoten> I know the url is correct because I see my server responding
[09:23:38] <diminoten> and I know the script is executing because other commands are happening
[09:23:55] <diminoten> I've read that the get callback only fires if the get is successful
[09:24:00] <diminoten> and the callback isn't firing
[09:24:16] <diminoten> so something must be wrong, but I don't know what... I'm asking for json, so it's possible the json is malformed?
[09:24:20] <diminoten> but it doesn't look malformed to me...
[09:24:33] <diminoten> I just want to see why it doesn't like what I'm giving
[09:25:03] <john> run the json through a linter to be sure
[09:25:07] <john> and post your code
[09:25:37] <Stianhtml> I'm having a peculiar problem in IE7. For some reason, on every single a href tag on the page, ie7 takes the value of href="value" and places it inside parenthesis after the link. So if i have a link like this <a href="http://somesite.com/something">something</a>. IE7 displays it as "something(http://somesite.com/something)
[09:26:48] <Blaster> any reason this wouldn't work?
[09:26:49] <Blaster> $('.tip.box p').css('background','url:(http://192.168.0.195/img/tipsHeader1.png) 0 0 no-repeat');
[09:30:00] <BoreK> ping
[09:30:25] <SataNix> Blaster: Does it work if you add it into the stylesheet?
[09:30:49] <SataNix> I think it may be because <p> is an inline element.
[09:31:21] <diminoten> john looks like it's invalid json
[09:31:56] <diminoten> it sucks because it's exactly what node is returning
[09:31:57] <diminoten> :-/
[09:32:38] <diminoten> it's in the form of { name : "value" } instead of {"name": "value" }
[09:32:43] <diminoten> does that really matteR?
[09:33:30] <Eviltwin> Anything you can write in the form name, you can write in the form "name"
[09:33:35] <Eviltwin> But not always the reverse
[09:33:52] <fission6> whats the recommended way to set a delay of 20 seconds then make an ajax call, starting when the page load
[09:33:54] <fission6> s
[09:33:57] <diminoten> that makes sense, but if it's in name form, then shouldn't jquery be able to convert that to "name"?
[09:34:07] <Eviltwin> fission6: setTimeout
[09:34:12] <takahiro> fission: a set timeout triggered on document ready
[09:34:37] <takahiro> nevermind
[09:34:48] <diminoten> wait nevermind, this IS in the correct format
[09:34:50] <diminoten> dammit
[09:34:54] <diminoten> okay, pasting code...
[09:35:13] <jeffsmykil> Can someone tell me why when dragged the bottom items are treating the columns as one number greater than they are
[09:35:14] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/9TmWh/
[09:35:42] <fission6> okay thanks
[09:36:53] <jeffsmykil> the items are logging that they are being dropped on column2 when it is column 1 and column3 when it is column 2
[09:37:29] <fission6> Eviltwin: setTimeout is just js you mean? not jquery
[09:37:39] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: You know indexes are 0-indexed, right?
[09:37:50] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs @ fission6
[09:37:51] <bot-t> fission6, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[09:37:56] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: yeah
[09:38:16] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: ...I don't think there are any indexes in play here
[09:38:26] <Eviltwin> "index = $(this).index()"
[09:38:51] <jeffsmykil> oh i forgot that i used index
[09:39:16] <jeffsmykil> but that still shouldn't matter should it?
[09:39:28] <jeffsmykil> the columns are static in name
[09:39:32] <Eviltwin> It's just the most common error
[09:40:22] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin:  I don
[09:40:39] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: I don't *think* that is the case here
[09:42:12] <jeffsmykil> unless there is something weird with $this on the droppable
[09:43:16] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: any other ideas?
[09:43:22] <Eviltwin> Ugh, I need to write up that doc about not using live...ever
[09:43:42] <jeffsmykil> yes i need to use on now
[09:43:44] <jeffsmykil> or delegate
[09:45:48] <diminoten> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=GcXL823p
[09:46:05] <diminoten> assuming the URL given returns valid JSON
[09:46:30] <diminoten> I'm really not understanding the issue here...
[09:46:41] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: any other ideas?
[09:46:49] <Eviltwin> ?sop @ diminoten
[09:46:50] <bot-t> diminoten, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[09:48:05] <diminoten> ...so?
[09:48:10] <Eviltwin> Also, you need to learn about the late binding of "this"
[09:48:25] <Eviltwin> Inside that $.get, "this" does not refer to the p that was clicked
[09:48:36] <diminoten> oh okay
[09:49:03] <diminoten> changes made, problem still exists though, let me show you what I fixed
[09:49:05] <Eviltwin> And you're trying to...append JSON to an element?
[09:49:08] <diminoten> yes
[09:49:17] <Eviltwin> What's your goal there?
[09:49:26] <diminoten> to see if this will work
[09:49:49] <Eviltwin> JSON is a structure and .append requires HTML or DOM elements
[09:49:51] <Eviltwin> So...don't do that
[09:50:24] <diminoten> so I have to stringify the result?
[09:50:39] <Eviltwin> Sure
[09:50:51] <Eviltwin> Or learn about console.log
[09:51:16] <diminoten> alright so is this what you recommend
[09:51:34] <diminoten> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=nWfuJBt8
[09:51:42] <diminoten> because that doesn't even get to the url anymore
[09:52:15] <Eviltwin> Is this page at http://localhost:3000/ ?
[09:52:18] <diminoten> yes
[09:52:24] <Eviltwin> Not like a subdir of that
[09:52:35] <diminoten> so I should add that back in?  then why did you link me to sop?
[09:53:14] <Eviltwin> The reason I linked it is because a lot of people come in here trying to have one server AJAX to a different server
[09:53:20] <diminoten> aha, fair enough
[09:53:24] <Eviltwin> And I wanted to make sure you weren't trying to do that
[09:53:29] <diminoten> I am not
[09:53:32] <diminoten> yet :D
[09:53:32] <jeffsmykil> same thing he did to me
[09:54:01] <diminoten> what I'm trying to do seems like the simplest thing in the world, pull JSON results from a server and print them to a page
[09:54:10] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I've wasted hours in here trying to help someone because there was a very fundamental concept they didn't understand
[09:54:31] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: no doubt. I'm an Eviltwin for president supporter
[09:55:02] <Eviltwin> From years of working IT, I've learned it's best to assume the client doesn't know anything and then work up from there
[09:55:11] <diminoten> this is the JSON: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=35Nkbr6b
[09:55:24] <diminoten> *very* simple stuff, it seems
[09:55:41] <jeffsmykil> read the object into variables then print the variables
[09:55:47] <Krinkle> diminoten: what's up ?
[09:55:50] <diminoten> I can't get to them
[09:55:50] <Eviltwin> diminoten: Are you using anything like Firebug?
[09:56:01] <diminoten> no I'm not, I don't know how
[09:56:07] <Krinkle> diminoten: How are you attempting to get at them ?
[09:56:13] <Krinkle> diminoten: XmlHttprequest ?
[09:56:15] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle:  you should definitely help me :D
[09:56:15] <diminoten> $.get
[09:56:17] <Whirl3d> is there any significant difference between $("#something").find("input") and $("#something input')
[09:56:24] <Eviltwin> diminoten: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[09:56:44] <diminoten> thanks Eviltwin I'll look at that
[09:56:48] <Krinkle> diminoten: The url is on the same site as the site you're executing the script ?
[09:57:01] <diminoten> haha yes
[09:57:01] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: Yes and no
[09:57:06] <diminoten> I had a pastebin
[09:57:09] <diminoten> 1 sec, let me get it
[09:57:16] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: They will get to the same result
[09:57:16] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: Result is the same, speed is slower though
[09:57:18] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle http://jsfiddle.net/9TmWh/
[09:57:22] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: But they will get there different ways
[09:57:38] <jeffsmykil> items being dragged are confused about the column they are being dragged into
[09:57:48] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: even speed may not be slower or faster, depends on a lot of factors that don't really matter.
[09:57:53] <jeffsmykil> seems like an index issue but there is no index
[09:57:58] <diminoten> Krinkle, http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=TY5dJNNG
[09:58:12] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: If you need to do multiple finds() from your #something, then cache the #something and do multiple finds()
[09:58:24] <Whirl3d> I have: var field=$("#fieldname"); var inp=field.find("input"); would it be better to say var field=$("#fieldname"); var inp=$("#fieldname input");
[09:58:28] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: If you only need "#something input" just do $("#something input")
[09:58:38] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: No
[09:58:46] <speyburn> hi, is there a smarter way to do this? i know that the $.post gives a json array response but how can i use it as i use it in the later $.ajax part? http://jsfiddle.net/6Bjhz/2/
[09:59:08] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: If you have an existing ("cached") variable, always use that.
[09:59:35] <Whirl3d> Good to know. Thanks Krinkle, EvitTwin, et al.
[09:59:56] <sdwrage> Does anyone know of an ellipsis truncate plugin that finishes at the end of a sentence?
[10:00:15] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: One word
[10:00:15] <diminoten> okay I've got a debugger up
[10:00:17] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: Asynchronous
[10:00:21] <sdwrage> I am finding great ones that wait until the end of a word but I can't find any that will sentence finish before it truncates
[10:01:00] <Whirl3d> ....yes?
[10:01:16] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: not to mention all three columns have the same class
[10:01:20] <jeffsmykil> and are all droppable
[10:01:27] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: make the target url relative instead of absolute
[10:01:32] <jeffsmykil> so them not dragging to the third column makes even less sense
[10:01:33] <Krinkle> so, starting with a /
[10:02:07] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: Also, you may wanna use $.getJSON('url', function(obj){ … });
[10:02:18] <Whirl3d> wait, I'm not working with urls....perhaps you mean another person
[10:02:24] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: No
[10:02:28] <Krinkle> Whirl3d: Yes
[10:02:30] <Krinkle> indeed :P
[10:02:34] <Whirl3d> pfew
[10:02:39] <diminoten> and yes
[10:02:42] <Krinkle> diminoten: make the target url relative instead of absolute
[10:03:00] <Krinkle>  Also, you may wanna use $.getJSON('url', function(obj){ … });
[10:03:02] <diminoten> okay, but when I do that, the server no longer reacts
[10:03:13] <Eviltwin> Huh: http://jsperf.com/select-vs-find/2
[10:03:18] <diminoten> and yes, I know about getJSON but it was failing and I wanted to try and get better errors, I guess...
[10:03:22] <Krinkle> diminoten: Where is this html being put ?
[10:03:31] <Krinkle> localhost:3000/index.html ?
[10:03:50] <diminoten> it's being accessed by file
[10:04:09] <diminoten> so file:///home/diminoten/js_practice/jquery_test.html
[10:04:15] <Krinkle> AJAX is not allowed to access locations that are not owned by the same owner was the script itself.
[10:04:18] <diminoten> is that violating the sop thingy?
[10:04:23] <Krinkle> yep
[10:04:26] <diminoten> damn
[10:04:52] <Krinkle> diminoten: But, there's hope
[10:05:02] <diminoten> there is?!?
[10:05:11] <Eviltwin> diminoten: That's kind of why I linked it to you.........
[10:05:13] <Krinkle> diminoten: Assuming you access cross-origin because you are unable to get it in the same location… (say yes before I continue..)
[10:05:17] <Eviltwin> And you dismiss it
[10:05:24] <diminoten> no
[10:05:27] <diminoten> :D
[10:05:29] <diminoten> just easier
[10:05:35] <diminoten> I just put it in the same location
[10:05:50] <jeffsmykil> Make me feel like a jerk now! http://jsfiddle.net/9TmWh/
[10:05:59] <diminoten> it's just very hard to test
[10:06:06] <Krinkle> diminoten: Anyway, if you want to keep them separate that's fine. YOu have to modify your localhost:3000 thing to return a callback
[10:06:39] <diminoten> thing in that previous sentence is defined as the $.get or on the node server?
[10:06:58] <Krinkle> On the node server, get the value of the 'callback' query parameter
[10:07:07] <Krinkle> then echo it and put the json object between parens
[10:07:18] <Krinkle> so http://localhost:3000/objects/hosts/host/4edd3d15d91e2bcf24000042?callback=foo
[10:07:19] <Krinkle> gives
[10:07:23] <Krinkle> foo({ … });
[10:07:27] <diminoten> so make it text instead of raw json?
[10:07:35] <Krinkle> no, make it javascript
[10:07:56] <diminoten> okay
[10:07:59] <diminoten> oh
[10:08:04] <diminoten> well but wait
[10:08:06] <Krinkle> jQuery will automatically create a callback function and give the result to the callback of $.getJSON
[10:08:15] <NoiseEee> var something = $('a selector').on('click',functionReference);   //how does functionReference know what element the click happend on?  what part of the 'event' has that?
[10:08:33] <Krinkle> NoiseEee: fn is called with context
[10:08:45] <Krinkle> it's in event also, but you want 'this'
[10:08:49] <diminoten> in the node server, the command is result.json(host.toJSON());
[10:08:49] <NoiseEee> im coming from prototype.js and trying to adjust :
[10:09:07] <Krinkle> functionReference = function(event){ console.log(this); };
[10:09:13] <Krinkle> NoiseEee: Try that and find out
[10:09:31] <Krinkle> this = element
[10:10:02] <NoiseEee> Krinkle: in this case, i've attached the handler to a 'div', but the click happens on an <a> inside. I can't seem to reference the <a>; this.tagName is "DIV"
[10:10:04] <diminoten> there, it worked
[10:10:07] <diminoten> fuck me that was dificult
[10:10:21] <Krinkle> NoiseEee: In that case you want event.target
[10:10:32] <Krinkle> that's just regular javascript, nothing you need jQuery for
[10:10:56] <Krinkle> .target = element clicked, not element that got the event (in)directly
[10:11:10] <NoiseEee> thanks Krinkle
[10:11:18] <Krinkle> diminoten: So you got it working ?
[10:11:22] <diminoten> yeah
[10:11:24] <Krinkle> diminoten: http://scripting.com/stories/2010/12/23/aNodejsModuleThatDoesJsonp.html
[10:11:32] <diminoten> thanks
[10:11:39] <Krinkle> JSON with a callback is known as "JSON-P"
[10:12:33] <Krinkle> diminoten: this basically http://pastebin.com/u0k9dws8, not sure
[10:12:42] <Krinkle> diminoten: but since you already had it working, I'd love to see what you did.
[10:12:56] <diminoten> I put the document into the same domain
[10:12:57] <diminoten> haha
[10:13:03] <Krinkle> right
[10:13:05] <Krinkle> :D
[10:13:13] <diminoten> it was just a hassle to do a poc that way
[10:13:28] <diminoten> but now it works, so whatever

[10:18:46] <marzen> Hi all, the company I work with is actively looking for an experienced jquery/js dev ... Must be comfortable w/ git, prefer those with experience with PHP - especially kohana.  Much of the work involves day to day bug fixes and refactoring and improvements on our codebase ... if interested PM me or send links to your github/portfolio to care.js.dev@gmail.com
[10:19:06] <jeffsmykil> marzen: there is a channel for that
[10:19:41] <marzen> jeffsmykil: what's the channel?
[10:19:44] <nezZario> Does anyone know of a right-expanding menu like this one, for jQuery: http://greengeckodesign.com/projects/MenuMatic/examples/vertical/index.htm?q=projects/menumatic/examples/vertical/
[10:19:53] <nezZario> that looks like it's mootools
[10:20:08] <Krinkle> Neil_: Try something with each() and inArray
[10:21:12] <Krinkle> Neil_: http://pastie.org/private/rhnc7vktxe9aa7viyrqhfg
[10:23:10] <Neil_> Krinkle: Thanks I'm just taking that for a spin
[10:24:38] <photosbyme> hello again , another day another code
[10:25:58] <photosbyme> please have a look at where i could modify this so instead of using the easing plugin i could just use fadeTo or scrollTo: http://jsfiddle.net/DHnVb/
[10:27:08] <necromancer> hey so sometimes in my ajax apps i get "$ is not defined". it usually happens when i load HTML code over ajax with a <script> tag in it. this inline JS has jQuery events bound in it, and they are not running because of this error.
[10:27:29] <necromancer> i know the solution, but is there any reason we can cite for why this happens?
[10:28:14] <ColKurtz> hey Eviltwin, thanks for the help last week
[10:28:25] <ColKurtz> wanna see the finished product? :D
[10:29:12] <ColKurtz> It turned out that using a timeout function run my destroy callbacck after 500ms made everything work perfect
[10:30:07] <jeffsmykil> OK I have simplified this http://jsfiddle.net/9TmWh/9/
[10:30:16] <jeffsmykil> please help
[10:30:21] <jeffsmykil> cherry top
[10:30:59] <jeffsmykil> drag bottom to top
[10:32:02] <ColKurtz> what's the problem jeff
[10:32:06] <ColKurtz> jeff
[10:32:10] <ColKurtz> jeffmy
[10:32:18] <jeffsmykil> hey
[10:32:29] <jeffsmykil> try dragging to the third column
[10:32:38] <jedimind> jeffsmykil, uhm GridLayout.row1[i]
[10:32:43] <jedimind> should be GridLayout.row1[i-1]
[10:32:48] <jedimind> because index starts at 0 not 1
[10:32:54] <jedimind> thats why your IDs are off
[10:33:36] <jeffsmykil> in which function?
[10:33:58] <Neil_> Krinkle: Would you expect this to work(?) http://pastie.org/private/j4l5aoaxcgntnkwtblonzq
[10:34:01] <jeffsmykil> populateColumns?
[10:34:13] <jedimind> jeffsmykil, all of them should have that if its the ID youre targetting
[10:34:18] <jeffsmykil> jedimind: I don't see how that matters
[10:34:24] <jeffsmykil> the columns are static ids
[10:34:36] <jedimind> sorry its the grid GridLayout.gutter[i].itemID gutter item
[10:34:39] <jedimind> that needs to be i-1
[10:35:12] <jedimind> anyway i also dont know what your problem is since i missed your explanation, im just talking about the ids being off by
[10:35:12] <jedimind> 1
[10:35:32] <igcewieling1> Using .change() is there a simple method to find the previous (before change) value of the field?
[10:36:04] <jeffsmykil> jedimind the problem is that I cant drag something into the column and get the correct ID
[10:36:06] <jeffsmykil> it is off by one
[10:36:11] <atynefield> Would anyone be able to point me into the correct direction for pulling a div id (generated by php while loop - empty div with id set to $row['id']? I want to be able to use that as an index for getting more information, then eventually performing a post to the url listed in $row['request_path'].
[10:36:48] <Krinkle> Neil_: I have to work on something else now
[10:36:51] <jeffsmykil> but that should have nothing to do with it
[10:37:01] <Neil_> Krinkle: not a problem thanks for the help so far.
[10:37:06] <photosbyme> broken it: http://jsfiddle.net/DHnVb/
[10:37:07] <Krinkle> you're welcome
[10:37:10] <jeffsmykil> jedimind: Im just dragging to a column and reporting the columns id
[10:37:48] <jedimind> yeah, sorry, my brain capactiy is not all here, maybe someone else can hop on, im trying to juggle 5 things at once
[10:38:04] <ryanneufeld> has anyone had any issues loading jquery in an iframe on IE?
[10:38:07] <jeffsmykil> ColKurtz:
[10:38:55] <jeffsmykil> its returning items dragged on to a column as the wrong column
[10:40:00] <ivmx> hi
[10:42:29] <ColKurtz> jeffsmykil, sorry at work missed your messages, you'll have to say my name to grab my attention
[10:42:55] <ColKurtz> do you have a link (or even better a jsfiddle)?
[10:43:05] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/9TmWh/13/
[10:43:08] <jeffsmykil> ColKurtz: http://jsfiddle.net/9TmWh/13/
[10:44:11] <ColKurtz> <jeffsmykil> jedimind the problem is that I cant drag something into the column and get the correct ID
[10:44:11] <ColKurtz> <jeffsmykil> it is off by one
[10:44:15] <ColKurtz> the ID of the DOM element?
[10:44:22] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I think part of the problem is that these elements are really wide
[10:44:24] <Eviltwin> For example
[10:44:30] <Eviltwin> Grab in the whitespace to the right of them
[10:44:34] <Sazpaimon> I want to replace the entire content of a table with new rows. If I'm selecting a td tag within the table would my best selector be $("#cell").parents("tbody") or .parents("table")
[10:44:35] <Eviltwin> And then drop it
[10:44:43] <jeffsmykil> oh man
[10:45:33] <jeffsmykil> that makes sense
[10:45:56] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/9TmWh/14/
[10:46:13] <Eviltwin> So I think it's doing a center-center comparison
[10:46:26] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[10:46:27] <jeffsmykil> man
[10:46:31] <jeffsmykil> thats infuriatingly simple
[10:46:35] <jeffsmykil> thank you so much
[10:46:45] <Eviltwin> Yeah, sorry, I noticed it about a half hour ago and got distracted
[10:46:51] <Eviltwin> Meant to tell you then
[10:46:55] <jeffsmykil> rofl
[10:47:06] <jeffsmykil> i think the vein in my forehead didnt explode
[10:47:09] <jeffsmykil> so i think im good
[10:48:09] <jeffsmykil> thanks so much Eviltwin
[10:49:53] <Anticom> hi all
[10:50:03] <photosbyme> going to keep asking :)
[10:50:16] <photosbyme> till i get it right
[10:50:43] <Anticom> i've got an jq ajax function wrapped with a native js function. my problem now is, that i don't get the returned stuff in callback functions (success and error) back out of the native js function
[10:50:46] <Anticom> any ideas?
[10:51:22] <vzlahagen> Anticom: can u paste ur code?
[10:51:40] <Anticom> vzlahagen sec, cell just rang
[10:53:07] <Whirl3d> is there anything I can type in console to get a script to stop looping?
[10:53:16] <Eviltwin> Anticom: You need to do a callback from your native function
[10:54:52] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use angularjs?
[10:54:54] <vzlahagen> Anticom: Eviltwin can help u far better than me =D
[10:57:16] <Anticom> alright, sorry guys
[10:57:21] <Anticom> here's the code: http://pastebin.com/8KGP30BR
[10:57:37] <radStatic> Any reason why my close button isn
[10:57:43] <radStatic> t working? http://radiantstatic.com/build/
[10:58:06] <radStatic> Specifically #mailCloseButton
[10:58:22] <Anticom> i've tried to declare a variable at the very begin of the function to have it in a scrope, where i can write the stuff in it inside the callbacks and return it after the ajax method, but that occasionally didn't worki
[10:58:23] <Anticom> work*
[10:58:40] <Eviltwin> Once you go async, you can't got back
[10:58:47] <Eviltwin> go back*
[10:59:37] <Anticom> radStatic what close button?
[10:59:48] <Anticom> i can't finde any to be honnest
[11:00:04] <Anticom> Eviltwin so what's the right way to do it?
[11:00:27] <radStatic> Anticom: Click the Write Mail icon in bottom left corner (right one). A window should open.
[11:00:42] <radStatic> Now for some reason that window won
[11:00:45] <radStatic> t close.
[11:00:46] <Anticom> i've also tried to access the xHr object or what it's called... when i console.logged the whole object it was fine, but as soon as i tried only to access the responseText param it failed :/
[11:01:02] <maraujop> jquery ajax can produce race conditions?
[11:01:13] <maraujop> if AJAX calls are asynchronous
[11:01:37] <Anticom> radStatic the window is sliding in from the right but there's no close button on it
[11:01:44] <Anticom> just a "send" button
[11:01:46] <maraujop> I don't mean jQuery is buggy, I mean success function of the same AJAX call can be executed concurrently?
[11:01:51] <Anticom> oh sorry, found it
[11:02:22] <Anticom> radStatic answer is simple: use FireBug
[11:02:32] <Anticom> (:
[11:03:08] <Eviltwin> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/ysyhB/
[11:03:19] <Anticom> thank's a lot Eviltwin :)
[11:03:25] <ajpiano> maraujop: ajax has the potential to create race conditions, regardless of whether you use jQuery
[11:03:53] <Anticom> Eviltwin errr... o.O
[11:03:59] <maraujop> ajpiano: Ok, that's what I thought, cause I'm sure I'm suffering one
[11:04:04] <Eviltwin> Anticom: If I understand correctly, you're trying to make your *synchronous* function return the result of *asynchronous* AJAX
[11:04:09] <withanx> anyone who has used jquery mobile: are you supposed to link to entire documents with doctypes, head, etc when you're using the default ajax linking?
[11:04:26] <withanx> the documentation is very unclear about this
[11:04:29] <Anticom> Eviltwin so what am i supposed to do?
[11:04:31] <maraujop> ajpiano: Will setting async to false, fix it?
[11:04:33] <Eviltwin> Anticom: Maybe if you show some code
[11:04:38] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Don't use async: false
[11:04:42] <ajpiano> maraujop: it will quote unquote "fix it" but not really
[11:04:46] <ajpiano> yo'ure just replacing one problem with another
[11:04:47] <Eviltwin> maraujop: http://jsfiddle.net/FStR5/
[11:05:12] <Ukto> anyone here good at content design? modifying sites to make things fit in and look nice? (i know its not jquery) but I need some webdev done. (I am more about backend code, then front end looks)
[11:05:13] <Eviltwin> maraujop: There's me using synchronous AJAX while letting my animation run
[11:05:16] <Anticom> Eviltwin ah now i got it
[11:05:44] <Eviltwin> maraujop: That's why should always use asynchronous AJAX
[11:05:46] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/g9dT5/
[11:06:05] <Anticom> so i should rather call the same function everytime the ajax callback fires to pass the data over to further processing
[11:06:16] <withanx> nobody here has used jquery mobile?
[11:06:17] <Anticom> right?
[11:06:41] <Eviltwin> Anticom: I...don't really understand
[11:06:44] <Anticom> withanx if you need a framework with nice graphics and fancy stuff like that, you could try sencha touch aswell ;)
[11:06:55] <Eviltwin> what you said
[11:06:55] <maraujop> Eviltwin: That's what I thought, that non async calls can be evil
[11:07:05] <maraujop> Eviltwin: Nice example :)
[11:07:07] <Eviltwin> Anticom: Why don't you post your code
[11:07:13] <withanx> Anticom: I'm a big user of ExtJS, but Sencha touch is just too slow for my liking
[11:07:15] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Pretty much all async AJAX is evil
[11:07:26] <Eviltwin> Because it means NOTHING ELSE can happen in JavaScript until they finish
[11:07:31] <Anticom> Eviltwin thing is, that i don't want redundancy in my code (same code in success AND error callback) since this invokes inconsistency
[11:07:36] <withanx> Anticom: takes a minimum of 7-8 seconds just to open a blank sencha app from an iPhone home screen
[11:07:41] <Zogot> Ahoy all
[11:07:43] <maraujop> Eviltwin: You mean sync AJAX, right?
[11:07:45] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Your page will be unresponsive while sync AJAX is running
[11:07:51] <Eviltwin> Sorry, yes, sync again
[11:07:55] <Eviltwin> async: false $.ajax
[11:07:57] <maraujop> Eviltwin: so how do I solve my race condition
[11:08:03] <Anticom> withanx what kind of thing are you developing?
[11:08:04] <Eviltwin> maraujop: I missed you explaining it
[11:08:10] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I'm quite a newbie on this
[11:08:37] <necromancer> are jQuery.ajax responses supposed to be independent of the loaded scripts on the page? the JS executed in an inline script in an HTML page doesn't recognize that jQuery is loaded, because it gives me "$ is not defined". any explanation as to why this happens?
[11:08:46] <maraujop> Eviltwin: well, I basically have an menu that fires an AJAX call. it's an asynchronous GUI
[11:08:58] <withanx> Anticom: just a mobile version of a pretty simple site
[11:09:03] <maraujop> Eviltwin: If I happen to click two menu tabs fast enough, before the first ends, I get a race condition
[11:09:14] <Anticom> necromancer check wether you've included jq BEFORE your code (:
[11:09:15] <Eviltwin> maraujop: You should cancel the old one
[11:09:16] <maraujop> Eviltwin: Then my GUI breaks in funny ways
[11:09:22] <fourcolors> Hi all. I'm creating my first jQuery plugin and was wondering if someone could help figure out why I can't a string on my params after I extended it? Here is my js fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/uBLeP/
[11:09:24] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/pP2Zn/1/
[11:09:35] <fourcolors> my problem is I want to set my string to "" when someone clicks a submit button.
[11:09:41] <necromancer> Anticom: libs are always in the <head> for me
[11:09:42] <fourcolors> This plugin is for dirty forms.
[11:09:49] <Eviltwin> maraujop: There's a little more going on there
[11:09:58] <Eviltwin> But the idea you should see is that I haev a var xhr;
[11:10:01] <necromancer> Anticom: and regardless, how would a jQuery.ajax() call work if jQuery wasn't loaded?
[11:10:07] <Anticom> withanx why not going for actionscript then? as you might now adobe flash is able to compile into native iOS apps now which would mean you'd end up with a proper and fast app
[11:10:08] <Eviltwin> And every time I go to AJAX, I abort the existing XHR if there is one
[11:10:18] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I'm already doing that, but the AJAX before this one
[11:10:19] <Eviltwin> And then set xhr  to the new XHR
[11:10:25] <maraujop> Eviltwin: is already in success state
[11:10:33] <maraujop> Eviltwin: doesn't that matter?
[11:10:48] <Anticom> necromancer just checking the obvious first, because that's why i am missing mostly, if you get what i mean
[11:10:52] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I mean the AJAX call has already succeeded
[11:10:53] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Mind if I see the code?
[11:11:10] <maraujop> Eviltwin: Sorry code is private at the moment
[11:11:15] <necromancer> flash can compile to iOS but it can't take advantage of most of the fun APIs
[11:11:21] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I cannot show it to you due to company policies
[11:11:27] <withanx> Anticom: I haven't looked at what Adobe has done, but I really hate getting into bed with Adobe.
[11:11:28] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Okay, even the relevant section?
[11:11:29] <necromancer> like you can't use the camera or mcic
[11:11:30] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I wish I could show it to you
[11:11:32] <necromancer> mic*
[11:11:35] <maraujop> Eviltwin: hold on
[11:11:51] <withanx> Anticom: not my favorite company, to say the least.
[11:11:58] <necromancer> withanx: why not just make it in HTML5?
[11:12:05] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Okay, then I need you to write remarkably similar code that illustrates your problem
[11:12:10] <withanx> necromancer: jquery mobile is HTML5.
[11:12:14] <Eviltwin> That illustrates your issue
[11:12:18] <Eviltwin> maraujop: At jsFiddle

[11:12:47] <Anticom> withanx if you realy want to stick with js, maybe this might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/215390/available-iphone-web-application-javascript-ui-library-frameworks
[11:12:50] <withanx> necromancer: yes, that's what I'm planning on doing, but the jquery mobile docs are iffy.
[11:13:32] <necromancer> withanx: you don't *need* mobile to make a mobile site. i'd only use it if a.) you want to take advantage of its UI, or b.) you want to take advantage of the extra events.
[11:13:37] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I will try my best
[11:13:45] <maraujop> Eviltwin: this will take a while
[11:13:49] <maraujop> Eviltwin: thanks
[11:13:56] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Keep it small and simple
[11:14:05] <Eviltwin> Just illustrate the AJAx issue
[11:14:38] <necromancer> withanx: it's basically like jQuery UI for mobile platforms, not a replacement for the jQuery framework on mobile platforms.
[11:16:21] <withanx> necromancer: yes, I know, I'm using it for it's UI, we want something simple and quick for mobile users
[11:16:34] <withanx> something that's guaranteed to work on all mobile devices
[11:16:36] <snover> withanx: Have you looked at Dojo’s mobile project?
[11:16:41] <snover> I mean
[11:16:43] <snover> it is part of dojo 1.7
[11:16:55] <withanx> I want to avoid anything too heavy, isn't Dojo similar to ExtJS?
[11:16:57] <snover> If you use and enjoy extjs, it would probably feel better to you than anything jQuery
[11:16:59] <withanx> er Sencha touch
[11:17:22] <Eviltwin> maraujop: I suggest you look at this useful API that jsFiddle provides: http://jsfiddle.net/K8TQM/
[11:17:27] <Eviltwin> /echo/html/
[11:17:47] <Eviltwin> Try clicking the AJAX button several times in a row
[11:17:50] <necromancer> withanx: i think you'll be fine with mobile honestly. what's your issue with it? have you ever used jquery ui?
[11:17:51] <Eviltwin> You'll see they all pile up
[11:18:10] <andrew9183> hey guys, i asked this earlier but i couldn't figure it out
[11:18:17] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/xaswH/2/
[11:18:25] <Aric> is there a way to make jQuery.validate put the error into an already existent <span> i made?
[11:18:28] <Eviltwin> Aric: What's the goal?
[11:18:29] <withanx> necromancer: briefly.  Mobile seems to be working well, I just hate the documentation
[11:18:37] <andrew9183> how can i get the div with id=1 ? instead of parent().parent().parent().parent()
[11:18:39] <Aric> right now it displays right but it makes a new elemnt and pushes my form down
[11:18:52] <necromancer> withanx: yeah it's kind-of annoying. part of the reason why i avoid it. though i've never had to use its UI segments, only its events
[11:19:00] <razzi> andrew9183 $('#1')
[11:19:06] <jayblanchard> andrew9183 I am checking
[11:19:17] <andrew9183> but what if the #1 is arbitrary
[11:19:19] <Aric> Eviltwin: can't show the page cause it's internal to company but it pushes stuff down by making a new elemnt but I wouldn't mind making an empty span for the future usage, i could do styling for its class with absolute positioning i guess
[11:19:38] <jayblanchard> andrew9183 what do you mean?
[11:19:39] <andrew9183> ie i want to select the div in that spot, not necessarily #1
[11:19:41] <razzi> what do you mean with arbitrary?
[11:19:59] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: So it has to have an ID?
[11:20:10] <andrew9183> basically, i  have a list of boxes with unique id's, each with an edit link on them.  i want the edit link to pass the unique id from the box to my link
[11:20:11] <Eviltwin> The furthest ancestor div that has an ID?
[11:20:18] <necromancer> andrew9183: if the div is id="1" then it's not arbitrary. if you're using id="" to describe some kind of relational ID, you're not using the id attribute properly.
[11:20:19] <jayblanchard> andrew9183 it's not the topmost ancestor so you have to have an identifier of some sort
[11:20:23] <andrew9183> not the furthest
[11:20:32] <Eviltwin> ?
[11:20:35] <Eviltwin> Then what?
[11:20:52] <Eviltwin> Always taht number of parents up?
[11:21:03] <andrew9183> no its always fixed
[11:21:16] <Ukto> hmm, they should make .grandfather
[11:21:19] <Ukto> save some characters.. :P
[11:21:29] <necromancer> Ukto: .closest() usually works ;)
[11:21:31] <Ukto> or grandparent() even :P
[11:21:39] <Ukto> yeah, was just making a joke :P
[11:21:44] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: I highly suggest you slap on a class
[11:21:58] <Ukto> you know.. .cousin() or .mother-in-law() = null :P
[11:21:58] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: On the <div id="1">
[11:22:14] <andrew9183> ah okay
[11:22:25] <jayblanchard> Except noone would ever visit .mother-in-law(0 if they didn't have to
[11:22:26] <Eviltwin> And then .closest(".myClass")
[11:22:55] <Eviltwin> Furthest ancestor div with an ID is http://jsfiddle.net/xaswH/3/
[11:22:57] <andrew9183> does closest return the one with myClass attached or the nearest parent of it ?
[11:23:22] <Eviltwin> But I suggest: http://jsfiddle.net/xaswH/4/
[11:23:56] <atynefield> @andrew - I'm actually researching sort of the same thing. I have a php loop that prints empty divs with the id=$row[sid] and I want to get more information from that row such as $row[request] without having to print that information on the page. (These divs have a class of result_div)
[11:23:59] <andrew9183> ah okay, thanks Eviltwin
[11:24:43] <andrew9183> atynefield: yeah, it looks like closest will do the job for me
[11:25:47] <NoiseEee> im moving from prototype to jquery and have a bunch of newb questions... http://jsfiddle.net/LWxvD/1/
[11:26:07] <NoiseEee> well one newb question there.
[11:26:33] <ajpiano> NoiseEee: $(event.taraget)
[11:26:35] <ajpiano> target*
[11:26:45] <NoiseEee> gah thanks ajpiano
[11:27:41] <tp43> whats the best and easiest file upload ajax plugin/
[11:28:15] <jayblanchard> tp43 http://www.uploadify.com/
[11:28:19] <Aric> Eviltwin: i just made a custom class and absolutely positioned it relative the input box
[11:28:34] <atynefield> Anyone know how I can essentially "get" the id of the div to use in a $("div.results_div").each()?
[11:28:41] <tp43> jayblanchard, thx
[11:28:50] <Eviltwin> Aric: $("div.result_div").attr("id")
[11:28:53] <Eviltwin> Err
[11:28:59] <Eviltwin> atynefield: $("div.result_div").attr("id")
[11:29:09] <atynefield> Nice!
[11:29:11] <atynefield> Thanks!
[11:29:35] <Eviltwin> Aric: What was up?
[11:30:31] <Anticom> bye all
[11:33:27] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I'm unable to reproduce the bug
[11:33:39] <maraujop> Eviltwin: All I can say is that my login shows a clear race condition
[11:33:54] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I've been coding years. I've coded many concurrent languages
[11:34:11] <maraujop> Eviltwin: The problem is that aborting ajax call doesn't suffice
[11:34:35] <Eviltwin> why not?
[11:34:37] <maraujop> because what the race condition is in the success code
[11:34:46] <Aric> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/NZgfKquB - error-block has css for absolutely positioning
[11:35:01] <maraujop> Eviltwin: Aborting the ajax call, stops success function?
[11:35:30] <maraujop> Success is being executed concurrently
[11:35:34] <Eviltwin> maraujop: No, only one function is ever running at a time in JavaScript
[11:35:59] <NoiseEee> okay, more newb.  http://jsfiddle.net/LWxvD/3/  am i using parent() incorrectly?  how to find a particular element that's a parent of the element i'm interested in?
[11:36:01] <maraujop> Eviltwin: That's what I know
[11:36:10] <maraujop> Eviltwin: But in this case, that doesn't happen
[11:36:11] <Eviltwin> maraujop: So this has nothing to do with AJAX then?
[11:36:21] <maraujop> Eviltwin: It does
[11:36:27] <Eviltwin> Or the problem doesn't
[11:36:31] <Eviltwin> Since it's happening in the success
[11:36:38] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I have an ajax call whose success: function(data) {blabla}
[11:36:38] <Eviltwin> In other words, after the AJAX
[11:36:49] <maraujop> Eviltwin: that's right
[11:36:59] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I actually have code that aborts previous ajax
[11:37:28] <Eviltwin> maraujop: If you're in a success, the AJAX is done
[11:37:29] <maraujop> Eviltwin: success function gets executed and changes context
[11:37:30] <Eviltwin> And can't be aborted
[11:37:32] <NoiseEee> christ, parents not parent  tyanyway
[11:37:35] <keybo> what event is fired when an option is a selected a select?
[11:37:52] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: .closest
[11:37:52] <maraujop> Eviltwin: it is like if two success functions were being executed
[11:38:06] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: over parents('article'), really?
[11:38:17] <dioda11_> hi - any i'm looking for a charting library that is easy to use and lightweight - any suggestions (thanks)?
[11:38:21] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: That will be every parent of the element that is an article
[11:38:41] <thedeeno> does jquery include an easy method of stacking div's relative to one another? I can't seem to get this div to render behind this element. z-index isn't working correctly because of stacking contexts.
[11:38:48] <Eviltwin> .closest() will be the closest parent that is an article
[11:39:06] <keybo> anyone?
[11:39:11] <keybo> .change() doesnt seem to be working fo rme
[11:39:15] <keybo> for me*
[11:39:30] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: thanks.
[11:40:14] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Without seeing your code, I'm not sure we can help you
[11:40:27] <Eviltwin> We don't know enough about what's going on
[11:41:09] <thedeeno> nvm, forgot te set the position property *face palm*
[11:42:36] <xwurf> hi, does anyone know how to escape brackets in jquery?
[11:42:44] <Eviltwin> xwurf: ?
[11:42:59] <xwurf> want to have .... 		 $('input[name=MyField\[0\]]').focus();
[11:43:10] <Eviltwin> You need two \'s
[11:43:11] <xwurf> i have a input field with html-tag name="MyField[0]"
[11:43:19] <Eviltwin> $("input[name=MyField\\[0\\]]")
[11:44:25] <andrew9183> dioda11_: try highcharts
[11:44:45] <xwurf> hmm, does not work...
[11:44:53] <Eviltwin> Try quoting?
[11:44:58] <xwurf> get uncaught exception: syntax error
[11:45:17] <Eviltwin> $("input[name=\"MyField\\[0\\]\"]")
[11:46:07] <xwurf> Yep, it works with Quotes, Eviltwin. thx a lot
[11:48:12] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I understand
[11:48:16] <cuci> hi guys! I'm new to javascript and I made a simple validation, using jquery-validation like so: https://gist.github.com/1439634, I get the desired results on fields that don't meet the condition, but passing good values yields:
[11:48:26] <cuci> Unknown pseudo class   [id='new_pacient'] input:file
[11:48:36] <maraujop> Eviltwin: only thing I can say I'm doing weird in the success call
[11:48:45] <maraujop> Eviltwin: is using eval for some js code
[11:49:42] <cuci> can you perhaps help me a bit with it. I know it must be some n00b syntax error, but I can't find it. I commented block by block the rules, messages but the same happens
[11:52:17] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Never use eval()
[11:52:23] <Eviltwin> ever
[11:53:11] <patrick99e99> So, if I have a text input with a default value.. say <input type="text" value="lol" /> ... and on the webpage, if I enter in foo into that form field..  and then I do $('form').html() ---  I see that the input's value is still "lol"
[11:53:36] <patrick99e99> is there a way to update the value of the form inputs based off of their text?
[11:54:23] <patrick99e99> should I just do input.change(function() $(this).val($(this).val()) )  or something?
[11:54:45] <maraujop> Eviltwin: do you happen to know jquery pjax?
[11:54:52] <joshsmith> how can I listen for a click event on anything *other* than a certain element
[11:54:57] <Eviltwin> No, what is?
[11:55:03] <NoiseEee> patrick99e99: you mean when you do $('formField').html(); ?   you should be getting the VALUE of form elements.
[11:55:04] <joshsmith> in this case I'm using Twitter Bootstrap's popovers
[11:55:11] <joshsmith> and I'm doing a manual popover on a click event of a link
[11:55:24] <joshsmith> if you click anywhere but on the popover, I want to trigger it again
[11:55:33] <joshsmith> trigger a hide, rather
[11:55:56] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Is it this? http://pjax.heroku.com/
[11:56:16] <maraujop> Eviltwin: that
[11:56:24] <Eviltwin> Okay, looks pretty straightforward
[11:56:38] <maraujop> Eviltwin: Well I'm not using it anymore, because it was limited for my use case
[11:56:48] <maraujop> Eviltwin: but I follow the same principle
[11:57:08] <maraujop> pjax doesn't get on well with responses that contain JS code
[11:57:20] <maraujop> so you need to fire JS code handling pjax.end event
[11:57:32] <patrick99e99> NoiseEee: I am trying to capture the state of a form-- i've got some highly dynamic form stuff that wipes out form fields completely, and so I wanted to capture the form so I can replace it with how it last was.. so for example I was doing form_state = $('form').html() ... then changing the form and trying to bring it back with $('form').html(form_state)
[11:57:42] <maraujop> That in practice means you end up having too much logic in JS
[11:57:51] <maraujop> that you would normally do in JS code in separate templates
[11:57:58] <patrick99e99> NoiseEee: but I am finding that if I change the text of a text input, when I do $('form').html(form_state), the original text value is there instead of the data entered in by the user...
[11:58:04] <maraujop> now I'm doing an AJAX call that requests a template
[11:58:08] <maraujop> strips the JS out of it
[11:58:14] <maraujop> renders the template in a div
[11:58:20] <maraujop> and then evals the JS code
[11:58:26] <maraujop> that happens in success AJAX
[11:58:28] <NoiseEee> patrick99e99: don't use html, get the VALUE.
[11:58:33] <maraujop> and I swear that is concurrent
[11:58:40] <maraujop> from what my logging shows
[11:59:00] <patrick99e99> NoiseEee: but I want to be able to capture the entire form.. the divs within it, the labels, the inputs, etc
[11:59:05] <chrisvwebdev> hello! i wanted to know if there was a better way to toggle a view between two css classes.
[11:59:23] <chrisvwebdev> right now, my code looks like this: email_input.hover(function(e){$(this).removeClass('orange').addClass('red');},
[11:59:23] <chrisvwebdev> 												  function(e){$(this).removeClass('red').addClass('orange');});
[11:59:24] <patrick99e99> NoiseEee: I am not trying to do this to a form element...
[11:59:28] <NoiseEee> patrick99e99: you want http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[11:59:52] <patrick99e99> NoiseEee: no I don't.. because the form has collapsable states..  Hidden elements that are revealed based on clicks
[11:59:53] <chrisvwebdev> is there a better way
[12:00:07] <Blaster> hey if a value returns "alternator red" and I just want "red" from that string, what do I do?
[12:00:09] <patrick99e99> NoiseEee: I want to be able to capture an exact snapshot of the forms html
[12:00:25] <Eviltwin> maraujop: For one thing, I suggest you look at: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.globalEval/
[12:00:40] <NoiseEee> patrick99e99: good luck, i have no clue how
[12:01:37] <monk12> is there a jQuery equivalent of the YUI "Browser History Manager"?
[12:01:58] <fris> jquery history plugin
[12:02:04] <Eviltwin> But .html("...<script>/*js code here*/</script>...") should run that code
[12:02:11] <igcewieling1> Because of the async nature of ajax it doesn't seem possible to call a function, which makes an ajax call and have the function return the ajax data to the caller of the function.  Is this correct or am I misunderstanding something?
[12:02:18] <monk12> Cool thanks fris, illl google for it
[12:02:30] <maraujop> Eviltwin: Doing that the code runs, but runs before DOM is ready and fails
[12:02:45] <maraujop> Eviltwin: if you do html .html events turned all messed up
[12:03:01] <maraujop> Eviltwin: using $.globalEval instead of eval doesn't fix it
[12:03:07] <fris> for script to work you need a proper closing tag
[12:03:32] <bonhoffer> is there a way to have a slider select [100, 150, 175, 200]
[12:03:42] <bonhoffer> i think i might just have to use a select box
[12:03:46] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I'm guessing there are not mutex mechanisms in JS, right?
[12:04:09] <Eviltwin> maraujop: No because only one thing runs at a time
[12:04:17] <joshsmith> how do I listen for a click event on anything other than an element? bind to the document click and then...?
[12:04:22] <andywww> Hi, i have the following code which works through a ul of li's and animates their opacity to 1:
[12:04:22] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/1439723
[12:04:27] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I know, but that is not what I'm seeing
[12:04:38] <fris> <\/script> has to be the closing
[12:04:42] <andywww> my problem is some of the LI's have LI's in them and my selector is selecting those li's too
[12:04:46] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I have console.logs that proove, two success are running
[12:05:02] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Without seeing more, I can't really help you debug
[12:05:06] <andywww> is there a way to stop a selector selecting child elements too?
[12:05:12] <Eviltwin> And it sounds like it's a massive beast of code
[12:05:21] <photosbyme> trying another way can someone help
[12:05:23] <maraujop> Eviltwin: it is too big :(
[12:05:25] <Eviltwin> Which means I'd have to spend more of my time than I'd like to looking at it
[12:05:39] <maraujop> Eviltwin: sorry, I really appreciate your efforts on helping me
[12:05:49] <maraujop> thanks a lot
[12:06:02] <Eviltwin> I'll see if I can give you a few pointers
[12:06:06] <Eviltwin> Things that might be helpful
[12:06:28] <maraujop> Eviltwin: thanks again
[12:06:47] <photosbyme> here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/Bonkers/CZv5n/
[12:09:08] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Maybe something like this is what you're looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/K8TQM/1/
[12:09:17] <patrick99e99> NoiseEee: is there a reverse of serialize?  like can I pass in a string of serialized data to a form and have it update all of the attributes?
[12:09:27] <k2iguvahetaja> anyone knows a really basic tree menu plugin for jquery? jQuery plugins page is down :(
[12:09:31] <Eviltwin> Actually what you probably want to use is Deferreds
[12:09:39] <k2iguvahetaja> jstree and treeview seem to advanced
[12:10:16] <photosbyme> I would like to write it so the external thumbnail in slider2 links to the one inside slider1 http://jsfiddle.net/Bonkers/CZv5n/3/
[12:12:35] <rns> anyone know how to make a submit button a hyperlink?
[12:12:46] <yedimind> rns, what the shit are you tlaking about ?
[12:12:47] <photosbyme> is there a way i can ask so this makes sense to somebody?
[12:12:49] <Eviltwin> maraujop: Have you used Deferreds before?
[12:13:00] <rns> yedimind, I want a link to submit a form
[12:13:06] <Eviltwin> maraujop: It's a different way of looking at async programming that I think might be particularly helpful for your problem
[12:13:06] <tp43> whats the best and easiest file upload ajax plugin/
[12:13:09] <yedimind> you make a submit button a hyperlink by changing <button> to <a>
[12:13:09] <dioda11> hi - i'm looking for some chart library that is lightweight and easy to integrate with jquery - any suggestions ?
[12:13:13] <rns> but I don't want it to be a button yedimind
[12:13:22] <yedimind> but a button is what submits the form, thats what it's purpose is
[12:13:27] <yedimind> so why would you remove that functionality ?
[12:13:35] <rns> yedimind, because I want it to be a link
[12:13:44] <yedimind> you mean you want it to LOOK like a link
[12:13:48] <rns> I want it to look like a link, yes
[12:13:52] <yedimind> so what does a link look like ?
[12:14:06] <rns> underlined blue text.
[12:14:09] <tp43> rns, you can just do a script that submits the form
[12:14:14] <yedimind> button { border: 0; background: 0; color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }
[12:14:20] <maraujop> Eviltwin: No, sorry, I don't know what deferreds are
[12:14:27] <rns> yedimind, I tried that but it didn't work
[12:14:29] <tp43> like the link links to a script, that doesn document.form.submit
[12:14:30] <yedimind> tp43, shut up
[12:14:34] <maraujop> Eviltwin: First time I hear from them. I was looking at your code now
[12:14:46] <yedimind> rns, then youre doing something wrong, there is no reason why that shouldnt work
[12:14:47] <tp43> yedimind, you shut up
[12:14:50] <yedimind> unless youre not using a button
[12:15:18] <yedimind> please dont tell people to ignore default form functionality and expected interaction
[12:15:19] <Eviltwin> maraujop: I've implemented something very similar before and only used jQuery's Deferreds once or twice
[12:15:20] <yedimind> for retarded reasons
[12:15:32] <Eviltwin> So let me see if I can get the terminology right
[12:15:36] <yedimind> if he removes the button, he removes inherent form flow and functionality
[12:15:44] <yedimind> and relies solely on javascript to submit the form
[12:15:52] <tp43> rns submitting a form using a link is very easy, if you google you will see how you can make a link, and then jquery can submit the form for you
[12:16:09] <yedimind> tp43, kindly, seriously, stfu you have no idea what youre talking about
[12:17:05] <tp43> yedimind, you shut up jackass, he wants to know how to submit a form with a link, either tell him or shut the fuck, don't pretend you are some yoda and give him the run around, either answer the question or shut your mouth
[12:17:14] <photosbyme> urgg i give up hpefully some might help?
[12:17:15] <yedimind> rns, if youre having trouble styling the button, ask in #css
[12:17:30] <yedimind> tp43, what part of this: <rns> I want it to look like a link, yes
[12:17:33] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/YFYq5/
[12:17:38] <andrew9183> is there a quicker more elegant way of doing this
[12:17:40] <yedimind> states that he wants to replace the button with an anchor? and destroy all native expected behaviour of the form ?
[12:17:41] <andrew9183> simple text goggle
[12:18:12] <tp43> rns, ('#youlink').submit()
[12:18:34] <yedimind> wow you dense tool
[12:18:47] <tp43> yedimind, you are a retard
[12:19:03] <tp43> yedimind, useless jackass
[12:19:18] <LakWork> anyone here have experience with javascript unit testing? specifically behavioral testing
[12:19:47] <yedimind> tp43, are you reading anything whatsoever that i said ?
[12:19:56] <yedimind> or are you just going to be a dick for the sake of being a dick ?
[12:20:51] <tp43> yedimind, you an idiot, instead of telling him about .submit() you are giving him the run around, "don't use a link use the submit button"
[12:20:54] <maraujop> Eviltwin: Thanks for the term
[12:21:02] <maraujop> I've done one and looks like it fixes my probelm
[12:21:06] <Eviltwin> Cool!
[12:21:10] <Eviltwin> I was going to make an example
[12:21:12] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I mean one deferred
[12:21:14] <Eviltwin> But sounds like you got it
[12:21:17] <maraujop> Eviltwin: It is working now
[12:21:21] <maraujop> damn!
[12:21:30] <maraujop> Eviltwin: I thought this would never work :)
[12:21:32] <yedimind> tp43, you do realize, that if he removes the buton, that the form cannot be submitted without javascript. it also cannot be submitted by hitting enter, it also interferes with accessibility
[12:21:37] <maraujop> Eviltwin: Thanks so much for your help
[12:21:40] <yedimind> and all he wants, is his button to LOOK like a link, nothing further
[12:21:43] <yedimind> thats specifically what he asked for
[12:22:09] <tp43> yedimind, so what, that is not what he asked, he asked how to submit for with a link, not if that was a good idea in you opinion
[12:22:20] <yedimind> no actually
[12:22:32] <yedimind> <rns> I want it to look like a link, yes
[12:22:36] <yedimind> thats exactly what he asked for
[12:22:49] <tp43> yedimind, screw off
[12:22:52] <yedimind> and you dont think that having a submit button removed and losing on all those things is important thing to mention?
[12:23:03] <yedimind> so you're wrong and now you're going to throw a tantrum ?
[12:23:52] <yedimind> if you're going to help someone, help them do things properly, and if there isnt a proper solution, make them aware of the consequences of your approach, if they still decide to make that decision then its up to them
[12:24:04] <tp43> I think it is NOT important to mention, and infact, I think it annoying and retarded to go into that
[12:24:25] <ajpiano> tp43: we try to give decent solutions here
[12:24:29] <ajpiano> if there are drawbacks to an approach
[12:24:38] <ajpiano> then people should be told about them
[12:24:40] <tp43> if you wanna a question, go ahead, otherwise, just keep quite, you don't need to be guiding like you are some super duper expert
[12:24:43] <ajpiano> it's not "annoying and retarded"
[12:24:52] <tp43> yes it is
[12:25:06] <ajpiano> and if someone else starts giving that information, they aren't an idiot
[12:25:12] <ajpiano> tp43: i don't?
[12:25:23] <tp43> refusing to answer the question and send someone off on a whole other thread is VERY annoying, and a stupid attitude
[12:25:53] <ajpiano> it really isn't,
[12:25:58] <ajpiano> sometimes javascript is not the answer to a problem
[12:26:01] <ajpiano> or it is only part of the answer
[12:26:09] <joshsmith> how can I stop the .popover('hide') event when someone clicks on *just* the .popover http://jsfiddle.net/ncJf4/
[12:26:16] <tp43> its one thing if he said, "oh thats easy, just use .submit() function, BUT its better to use the submit button due to it other functionalities...
[12:26:48] <tp43> But he said forget about using a link, YOU MUST use a button, anything less is uncivilized.  That is stupid behaviour/attitude
[12:26:48] <yedimind> tp43, people who are learning this do not know what they're asking for half the time, thats the problem, i asked him a few follow up questions and denoted that in fact he only needed it to LOOK like an anchor
[12:26:57] <yedimind> and not specifically be an <a> tag for some other reason
[12:27:13] <yedimind> so i suggested he style his button using css to make it look like an anchor, which is the right approach
[12:27:13] <tp43> yedimind, you were waisting his time trying to act like a smartass
[12:27:39] <yedimind> how dude? by actually spending my time to understand what he's trying to do, rather than blindly throwing him some answer that actually does more harm than good?
[12:27:41] <tp43> yedimind, you were gaining some imaginary superiority feelings by acting like a smartass
[12:27:56] * john watches contently.  puts popcorn into the microwave.  waits...

[12:29:04] <yedimind> thanks, grammer backwards it gets when angry i am

[12:29:11] <bl4ckcomb> :D
[12:29:32] <dcope> What is the function to see if an element contains a child element?
[12:30:00] <bl4ckcomb> dcope, has("*")
[12:31:07] <joshsmith> how can I stop the .popover('hide') event when someone clicks on *just* the .popover http://jsfiddle.net/ncJf4/
[12:31:54] <dcope> bl4ckcomb: Is there a way to treat the return as a boolean?
[12:32:02] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: Sure about that?
[12:32:13] <dcope> comment_element.has("#reply-form") == null doesn't seem to be of any help. Docs say has returns a jquery()
[12:32:19] <Eviltwin> dcope: I think you want .children().length > 0
[12:32:43] <bl4ckcomb> oh yes, I thought has would return a bool, which would actually make sense =/
[12:33:36] <DaOgre> I'm having a general brainfart on callback functions.  I'm working on a jquery/ajax powered login page.  It's up at http://www.roundsky.com/agency/ and the issues is once the proper info has been submitted
[12:33:37] <bl4ckcomb> jquery should probably s/has/having/ !
[12:34:18] <DaOgre> Right now Im doing a window.location redirect, but I was trying to have the function return true, but this never seemed to be the case
[12:34:29] <luke--> hi
[12:34:57] <dcope> Eviltwin: awesome, thank you :D
[12:35:06] <luke--> is there a method in jquery like Prototype's bind() to modifiy what a method uses as "this" ?
[12:35:10] <erichynds> DaOgre: you can't do that
[12:35:18] <erichynds> ?ajax101 @ DaOgre
[12:35:19] <bot-t> DaOgre, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[12:35:29] <DaOgre> awesome thanks guys
[12:35:51] <joshsmith> how can I stop the .popover('hide') event when someone clicks on *just* the .popover http://jsfiddle.net/ncJf4/
[12:36:15] <Eviltwin> bl4ckcomb: http://jsperf.com/has-vs-children-length-0
[12:36:35] <joshsmith> maybe there's some way to use e.target?
[12:38:41] <ajpiano> joshsmith: i'm on a terrible train wifi, your fiddle *just* loaded for me
[12:38:45] <ajpiano> from the first time you posted it
[12:38:59] <ajpiano> what you can do is use see ?jQuery.contains
[12:39:00] <bot-t> jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[12:39:05] <joshsmith> ajpiano: wow. sorry for being spammy and sorry for your wifi
[12:39:31] <joshsmith> I came in the middle of an argument, too, so poor timing :/
[12:39:38] <ajpiano> joshsmith: you should save a reference to the geo- whatever dom element, and do something like this
[12:41:00] <ajpiano> var $geolocation = $("#geo-location");  $(document).on("click", function(e) {  if ( !jQuery.contains( e.target, $geolocation[0] ) { $geolocation.popover("hide"); }    });
[12:41:14] <ajpiano> joshsmith: you could also take a look at ben_alman's "outside events" plugin
[12:41:19] <ajpiano> ?g cowboy outside events
[12:41:21] <bot-t> ajpiano, cowboy/jquery-outside-events - GitHub - https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-outside-events
[12:43:46] <Eviltwin> Not sure how often it comes up but .isEmpty() might be helpful
[12:43:51] <Eviltwin> http://jsperf.com/has-vs-children-length-0
[12:44:23] <Eviltwin> As an alias for checking if .firstChild is truthy
[12:44:27] <joshsmith> ajpiano: hmm if I click the document it doesn't hide, though
[12:45:11] <Eviltwin> .children().length is faster than .is(":empty") for small number of children
[12:45:57] <ajpiano> joshsmith: code examples are for Conceptual Purposes Only™
[12:46:11] <ajpiano> joshsmith: feel free to debug the underlying assumptions of that code, etc
[12:48:13] <Eviltwin> Hmm... I'd like to see a parameterized jsPerf
[12:48:36] <joshsmith> ajpiano: hmm I'm just trying to parse it
[12:48:47] <Eviltwin> Where it runs setup, all of my test cases, and teardown but also for varying values of N that I can pick
[12:49:09] <joshsmith> what does $geolocation
[12:49:09] <joshsmith> [
[12:49:11] <joshsmith> er
[12:49:18] <joshsmith> $geolocation[0] mean?
[12:49:53] <joshsmith> oh, wait! I got it
[12:49:57] <joshsmith> thanks ajpiano
[12:50:25] <bl4ckcomb> is there a way to detect horizontal scrolling of a touchpad?
[12:50:40] <erichynds> joshsmith: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/ncJf4/4/
[12:50:44] <LakWork> ajpiano do you have any advice on unit testing javascript methods which have to run in the context of a given page as opposed to within some kind of test harness?
[12:51:17] <LakWork> for example, testing: when user clicks > opens flyout: assert([flyout property])
[12:52:03] <ralphholzmann> is there a way to list all the converters available in $.ajax ?
[12:53:24] <ajpiano> awesome, the power of latency
[12:53:54] <andrew9183> i'm starting to get a hang of jquery.  and just wondering for learning purposes - is it useful to keep learning more jquery or to go learn javascript ?
[12:54:05] <joshsmith> erichynds: I'm not sure I understand that logic as much
[12:54:13] <bl4ckcomb> you should learn JS before you learn jQuery
[12:54:18] <bl4ckcomb> since jQuery is JS
[12:54:23] <erichynds> joshsmith: this one is less boned: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/ncJf4/5/
[12:54:46] <bl4ckcomb> *a JS toolset/framework
[12:55:11] <joshsmith> erichynds: ah yeah, that's easier to read
[12:55:23] <erichynds> also
[12:55:33] <erichynds> twitter bootstrap might have methods for getting to it's underlying object
[12:55:39] <erichynds> but i was too lazy to poke around
[12:56:00] <joshsmith> I tried googling, but couldn't find
[12:57:25] <joshsmith> erichynds: sorry for being dumb, but in both examples, what does the zero index of that object refer to
[12:57:27] <joshsmith> like in http://jsfiddle.net/ncJf4/3/
[12:57:32] <joshsmith> what is $geolocation[0]?
[12:57:37] <joshsmith> why not just $geolocation?
[12:57:39] <erichynds> joshsmith: it extracts the DOM element from the jquery object
[12:57:46] <erichynds> $.contains() takes DOM elements
[12:57:50] <joshsmith> ahh
[12:57:53] <joshsmith> gotcha
[12:57:56] <joshsmith> makes sense
[12:59:57] <sdwrage> Anyone know of a truncate ellipsis plugin that allows you to start the truncate after a sentence completes after the height limit has been reached?
[13:00:42] <Eviltwin> sdwrage: How long have you been asking this here?
[13:00:57] <sdwrage> Eviltwin, twice
[13:01:01] <sdwrage> I logged in earlier
[13:01:19] <sdwrage> Eviltwin: last time I checked it wasn't a crime to ask a question
[13:01:31] <sdwrage> ;)
[13:02:57] <sdwrage> now, if I had been posting this every ten minutes, yeah, I understand your concern but I asked once earlier this afternoon and just now.
[13:03:09] <Eviltwin> I recall you asking this yesterday as well
[13:03:44] <Eviltwin> And explaining that overflow: hidden was really the only flexible option
[13:03:53] <scorphus> there is no way of specifying a callback function to remove(), so, is there any way of calling a callback function after removing an element?
[13:03:56] <sdwrage> Eviltwin: wrong, I asked if there was a solution to a problem I was having with text truncation. I found a few plugins that do ALMOST what I need. I am merely seeing if there is something that expands on that
[13:04:13] <sdwrage> which is why I am here today
[13:04:32] <Eviltwin> The width/height of text totally depends on the styling properties of the element it is contained in
[13:04:36] <Eviltwin> Which is where the problem arises
[13:04:47] <sdwrage> There are truncate libs that do by height
[13:05:33] <thedeeno> I'm using the size effect to decrease my element's height from 100 to 80px. Later I want to restore the height, however, using the size effect with a height of 100 results in a bunch of css styles that are slightly off. How do I restore this height correctly?
[13:05:38] <sdwrage> the only problem I have is that it wants to use ellipsis (… stuff stuff stuff ) and only does it after a word finishes
[13:05:47] <sdwrage> not a sentence
[13:05:48] <thedeeno> in the source it looks like there's a restore method, but I don't know how to use it
[13:06:40] <Eviltwin> sdwrage: .remove() removes the element immediately
[13:06:42] <Eviltwin> Err
[13:06:47] <Eviltwin> scorphus: .remove() removes the element immediately
[13:06:54] <Eviltwin> As soon as the call is done, the element has been removed
[13:07:04] <arvindravi> hi all,i have a page with multiple slidetoggle triggers,but only the first few trigger it smoothly,the rest of them when clicked are jerky,they take me to the beginning of the page and its not smooth,can someone help me resolve this?
[13:07:08] <Eviltwin> It's a synchronous function call
[13:07:23] <chrisvwebdev> ***eating popcorn, reading the board
[13:07:24] <Eviltwin> .remove(mycallback) would just me .remove(); mycallback();
[13:08:13] <joshsmith> yo
[13:08:21] <sdwrage> Eviltwin: I think at the end of the day… my two options to give the client is… height based truncation with a "…read more on page 54" ellipsis or varied heights.
[13:08:44] <igcewieling1> If I used my_func($(this)) then in my_func(field) { }  I would reference field. or $(field).
[13:08:51] <igcewieling1> ?
[13:09:25] <Eviltwin> igcewieling1: field but it depends on what you're doing
[13:09:29] <Eviltwin> field probably*
[13:10:47] <igcewieling1> I want to use .hadClass() and .val()
[13:11:01] <Eviltwin> field
[13:11:15] <igcewieling1> if (field.val() == "") like that
[13:11:20] <Eviltwin> Yes
[13:11:31] <igcewieling1> thanks.
[13:11:34] <Eviltwin> Do you know what $(...) does?
[13:12:16] <Smigol178> Hye all
[13:12:33] <Smigol178> This code doesn't make Firefox to break the link forward:
[13:12:37] <joshsmith> erichynds: have you worked with Bootstrap before?
[13:12:42] <Smigol178> 	$('#prsubmitbtn').click(function(){
[13:12:42] <Smigol178> 			var s=confirm('Are you sure you want to submit this Purchase Requisition?');
[13:12:42] <Smigol178> 			if(!s) return false;
[13:12:42] <Smigol178> 		});
[13:12:42] <erichynds> nope
[13:12:47] <erichynds> ?p @ Smigol178
[13:12:48] <bot-t> Smigol178, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:12:51] <Smigol178> it works for Chrome, but not for Firefox
[13:12:53] <igcewieling1> I must have some other bug.  Eviltwin not really. 8-)  doesn't $() turn whatever is inside into a jQuery object?
[13:12:56] <joshsmith> haha one step ahead of me on that erichynds
[13:13:06] <Smigol178> It's about a button, that when clicked shows a simple confirm
[13:13:11] <erichynds> Smigol178: just "return confirm('Are you sure?');"
[13:13:16] <erichynds> and
[13:13:20] <erichynds> yeah.
[13:13:22] <Eviltwin> igcewieling1: It creates a jQuery object out of what you give to it
[13:13:25] <Smigol178> ?? are you sure
[13:13:30] <Eviltwin> And a jQuery object has the things like hasClass and val
[13:13:32] <Smigol178> let me see
[13:13:34] <erichynds> i am very sure
[13:13:44] <Eviltwin> So if you're passing a jQuery object to my_func
[13:13:49] <Eviltwin> It has things like hasClass and val
[13:14:52] <igcewieling1> Eviltwin: *nod*  thats makes sense.
[13:16:50] <Smigol178> It didn't' work
[13:16:56] <Smigol178> Firefox just moves
[13:16:59] <Smigol178> The dialog shows
[13:17:13] <Smigol178> but even if you don't click, it goes forward, it doesn't happen with Chrome
[13:17:14] <McBoingBo>  How can I create a link from 1 page to another that has jquery tabs? like http://www.example.com/page#tab-1 ?
[13:18:09] <Smigol178> the button has this also: onclick="location.href='/pr/reject/913341'
[13:18:34] <Smigol178> so, the confirm dialog shows up, but it doesn't hold it, it just goes to that location
[13:18:36] <Smigol178> any clue?
[13:19:02] <Smigol178> actually is like this: onclick="location.href='/pr/reject/913341';"
[13:19:13] <Smigol178> however Chrome does hold it
[13:19:28] <Smigol178> Im really freaking out with this
[13:19:28] <McBoingBo> can I href to a jquery tab, my guess is no since trying to add #tab-2 to my URL is not working
[13:20:18] <Smigol178> hello???
[13:20:59] <Aristata> Hey guys, I have been poking at this problem for a good couple hours now with no result.  It's a problem with the jQuery SelectBox Plugin. I keep getting the error cannot read property menuTransition of undefined. Is occurs on line 448 of jQuery.selectBox.js : https://github.com/claviska/jquery-selectBox/blob/master/jquery.selectBox.js
[13:21:03] <Smigol178> it looks like the onclick event in the button is taking before the $(XXX).click() one
[13:21:27] <Aristata> I have a live site up, but I can't link to it publicly, if anyone wants to have a look I would be more than happy to send the link
[13:21:37] <Smigol178> no clues?
[13:22:50] <Smigol178> Any one had a similar issue please?
[13:23:18] <chrisinajar> Smigol178: i see a ton of spam from you, reword your question into 1 sentence.
[13:23:26] <Aristata> Smigol178:  What are you asking?
[13:23:31] <Smigol178> What?
[13:23:42] <Aristata> Typing things out
[13:23:43] <Aristata> like this
[13:23:46] <Aristata> is spammy
[13:23:49] <Aristata> And annoying
[13:24:15] <Bankzilla> spammy
[13:24:16] <Bankzilla> spam
[13:24:17] <Bankzilla> spam
[13:24:17] <Aristata> Typing things out like this is nice and neat, especially for those of us who are dealing with irc in a small console or something
[13:24:17] <Bankzilla> lo
[13:24:40] <Smigol178> I did
[13:24:43] <Smigol178> read above
[13:24:47] <chrisinajar> Smigol178: no
[13:24:58] <Aristata> I can't, I just got here, which is why I asked what the problem is
[13:25:00] <chrisinajar> Smigol178: i don't want to filter through your spam to find your question/
[13:25:14] <Smigol178> The spam was after the question
[13:25:38] <chrisinajar> Aristata: he said like 64 thousand 1 word sentences, including a "hello???"... and now refuses to ask a question....
[13:25:50] <chrisinajar> oh well! i'll get back to work then, I /was/ going to help you :P
[13:25:52] <Aristata> Lovely
[13:26:03] <chrisinajar> indeed. i love IRC newbies :P
[13:27:37] <Bankzilla> Actually Smigol178 looking up the irc chat, you never did type it in one sentence, someone even recommended using a pastie, which you seem to of avoided also.
[13:28:02] <Bankzilla> Smigol178: If you want help, one line is best, and remember not everyone is always connected when you first asked your question
[13:28:55] <Smigol178> OK
[13:29:39] <Smigol178> I had just 3 lines of code, I find more optimal in terms of resources and time to paste here rather than opening another site, paste, come back here, put the link, etc..
[13:30:03] <Aristata> Optimal is a pastie, almost without exception
[13:30:22] <Bankzilla> ?p @Smigol178
[13:30:23] <bot-t> Smigol178, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:30:25] <fatguylaughing> I'm needing to clear all the content that is inside a certain div. I've got code here http://jsfiddle.net/v84E9/ It's not working. Not even sure I'm close to what I should be doing.
[13:30:30] <Bankzilla> Now all you have to do is click the link ;)
[13:30:33] <Eviltwin> Guys, seriously, jsFiddle
[13:30:51] <fatguylaughing> I appreciate any help in advance.
[13:30:54] <Smigol178> Have you guys read The Process from Kafka?
[13:30:55] <Eviltwin> It lets us run the code without having to then copy it somewhere else
[13:31:14] <Eviltwin> fatguylaughing: Try not using Moo Tools
[13:31:17] <Smigol178> If not, I seriously recommended it
[13:31:17] <Eviltwin> And using jQuery instead
[13:31:19] <igcewieling1> is there something I can use to get the type of an element? i.e. span, div, form, input, etc?  I'm not even sure what to google for.
[13:31:19] <Smigol178> See you
[13:31:24] <marshy_> hi
[13:31:30] <Eviltwin> fatguylaughing: http://jsfiddle.net/v84E9/3/
[13:31:58] <Bankzilla> igcewieling1: What do you mean by the type of element?
[13:32:01] <marshy_> Do i generally not want to use $(document).ready in a lightbox that was created via ajax?
[13:32:04] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: So don't use jsfiddle?
[13:32:10] <Aristata> fatguylaughing:  That isn't jquery, this is : http://jsfiddle.net/v84E9/5/
[13:32:11] <marshy_> Because when I try to execute code within that $(document).ready, it doesn't work.
[13:32:23] <Eviltwin> fatguylaughing: jsfiddle defaults to Mootools as the framework
[13:32:30] <Eviltwin> fatguylaughing: Just gotta drag the select down to jQuery
[13:32:43] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: oh…. well crap
[13:32:47] <fatguylaughing> sorry about that
[13:32:48] <ajpiano> igcewieling1: element.nodeName
[13:33:17] <ajpiano> whoops, i mean element.tagName
[13:33:48] <fatguylaughing> Ok, so .empty() and .html('') both work. Is one preferred over the other?
[13:33:54] <Eviltwin> fatguylaughing: The first one
[13:34:02] <fatguylaughing> Thank you
[13:34:52] <igcewieling1> ajpiano: heh,
[13:35:26] <Eviltwin> fatguylaughing: .html('') effectively does .emtpy().html('') I believe
[13:35:58] <Eviltwin> Err
[13:36:02] <igcewieling1> ajpiano: sorry, this is a jquery object
[13:36:03] <Eviltwin> .empty().append('')
[13:36:42] <ajpiano> igcewieling1: you can get the element from a jquery object
[13:37:26] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: Ok that makes more sense
[13:37:30] <fatguylaughing> Thanks a lot
[13:37:32] <igcewieling1> I'm getting "undefined"
[13:37:57] <igcewieling1> let me try it further up in the code
[13:38:36] <fatguylaughing> Eviltwin: however If I'm going to replace the html that is inside the div with different html should I just use .html?
[13:38:53] <igcewieling1> nope.  I must be doing something wrong.
[13:39:33] <Bankzilla> fatguylaughing: If you're going to replace all the html inside the div, yes html() is the better approach
[13:40:06] <shafire> hello
[13:40:08] <fatguylaughing> Thanks Bankzilla, Eviltwin and Aristata I appreciate all the help
[13:40:10] <shafire> I am using jquery with Drupal.behaviors.myTheme. When I load html content via $().load into it, jquery does not perform on this loaded html code. how can i change it?
[13:41:55] <marshy_> Can someone tell why my jQuery code inside $(document).ready  isn't executing when called from an ajax lightbox?
[13:41:59] <NoiseEee> hi, more jquery newbiedom... http://jsfiddle.net/BXXQz/
[13:42:11] <joshsmith> ajpiano: that jQuery.contains you showed me earlier breaks in Firefox for some reason
[13:42:48] <NoiseEee> in prototype.js, I'm used to using bind() but I can't seem to grok the jquery way... "this.prance is not a function"
[13:43:36] <igcewieling1> ajpiano: element.val() gives the expected data, but element.tagName gives 'undefined'.    Do you have any ideas?
[13:43:40] <ajpiano> joshsmith: it really oughtn't too
[13:43:58] <ajpiano> igcewieling1: element[0].tagName
[13:44:19] <joshsmith> ah, I realize what I was doing wrong
[13:44:29] <joshsmith> I was doing a $.contains with an element that was undefined
[13:44:32] <joshsmith> and that broke in FF
[13:44:49] <joshsmith> but I really just had to check for truth of that elem
[13:46:13] <igcewieling1> ajpiano: thanks!  That seems to have worked.
[13:46:37] <marshy_> How do I execute jquery code from an ajax response page?
[13:48:49] <ajpiano> NoiseEee: you can use $.proxy to do the same thing as prototype's bind
[13:49:06] <ajpiano> NoiseEee:     $('p').on('click',$.proxy(this.dance, this));
[13:49:21] <NoiseEee> ajpiano: man thanks so much... i feel so newb
[13:49:42] <ajpiano> NoiseEee: otherwise you are just passing it a function reference which jquery .apply-s to the the element itself
[13:50:00] <Blaster> hey if I use a fadeIn on mouse over for example, if I move my mouse over it, it happens like 20 times sequentially.  Is there a way to force it to only do it once?
[13:50:03] <ajpiano> heh :) no prob
[13:50:16] <Blaster> If I move my mouse over top of it 20 times
[13:51:23] <joshsmith> NoiseEee: saying he's noob? world is ending.
[13:51:52] <alexwait> hey jquery denizens. I am trying to do the following $($((".someClass", ".someOtherClass"), aValidParentElement).live('click')
[13:52:26] <alexwait> it only binds to the second (.someOtherClass)
[13:52:45] <ajpiano> ?fix hover @ Blaster
[13:52:46] <bot-t> Blaster, The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using throttle/debounce (http://bit.ly/e8d9TB). Animating? How .stop() works (http://bit.ly/5kq9xo)
[13:52:50] <joshsmith> remove the middle quotes and commas and just put a space alexwait
[13:52:57] <ajpiano> alexwait: what in good name
[13:53:12] <alexwait> ah man. I meant $(".someClass, someOtherClass"
[13:53:14] <Bankzilla> ajpaino is there anywhere i can read up on the bot commands?
[13:53:17] <alexwait> totally typed that wrong
[13:53:43] <ajpiano> that's not the problem either
[13:53:43] <ajpiano> alexwait: you should use .on
[13:53:47] <alexwait> here's the actual code if it helps. "parent" *is* valid
[13:53:47] <alexwait>     	$(".unpauseHeaderAction, .pauseHeaderAction", parent).live('click', pauseActionsFunction);
[13:53:52] <alexwait> we're using jQuery 1.6.1
[13:54:06] <joshsmith> upgrade your jQueries?
[13:54:19] <Aristata> upgrade! all the jqueries!
[13:54:19] <alexwait> trying to fix this issue before a release
[13:54:24] <alexwait> in a couple days
[13:54:29] <alexwait> too soon to do a full jQuery upate
[13:54:31] <alexwait> update*
[13:54:49] <joshsmith> it's...just a script tag?
[13:55:05] <alexwait> not hard to physically update
[13:55:23] <alexwait> but don't want to release the website without having enough time to test if there's anything small wrong
[13:55:39] <alexwait> due to the update. I realize it's probably fine but just playing it safe here (also not my decision to make)
[13:55:51] <Aristata> alexwait: why don't you just prepend each selector with the parent
[13:55:51] <joshsmith> FAIR ENOUGH
[13:55:58] <ajpiano> it has superseded live and does not have limitations of live like requiring superfluous selections and only working directly after a selector
[13:55:58] <ajpiano> in 1.6.1 you can still use delegate
[13:56:01] <ajpiano> alexwait: $(parent).delegate(".unpauseHeaderAction,.pauseHeaderAction", "click", fn);
[13:56:48] <alexwait> I'll try that :D
[13:57:05] <alexwait> event still isn't firing :(
[13:58:09] <someprimetime> if i'm doing $('#blah').focus(function() { $(this).select();}); how can I make it so that it keeps it highlighted after the mouse is let go?
[13:58:31] <someprimetime> do i need to add something for focus out?
[14:01:13] <ajpiano> alexwait: live demos are considerably more debuggable for strangers than just you saying it doesn't work
[14:02:25] <alexwait> fiddling ;)
[14:03:12] <Slipstream> anyone know where we can get plugins from while the plugins site is being re-made? kind of a bummer if you're in the middle of a project
[14:04:13] <ajpiano> Slipstream: http://jquerylist.com is good
[14:04:49] <ajpiano> it links to the plugins.jquery.com a bunch, but you should be able to google it at that point if you find something you like
[14:05:34] <alexwait> here you guys go: http://jsfiddle.net/8Z2ym/2/ (:D) As you can see, the "not in container"
[14:05:38] <alexwait> shows the alert
[14:05:46] <alexwait> the oldest 1.6 jquery the site has is 1.6.4
[14:05:54] <Slipstream> thanks, i'll have a look. I'm looking for the localized messages plugin, which i believe is from jquery itself
[14:05:55] <alexwait> maybe between 1.6.1 and 1.6.4 the multiiple selectors bug was fixed
[14:07:45] <alexwait> looks like switching to .on() in jQuery 1.7.1 has the same issue
[14:07:51] <alexwait> "NOT IN CONTAINER" still fires the alert box
[14:10:19] <ajpiano> what is "the multiple selectors bug"
[14:10:33] <ajpiano> i'm loading your fiddle ...veerrrryyyyy sloooowwllly
[14:10:55] <alexwait> figured out what's wrong :\
[14:10:59] <alexwait> at least in my fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/8Z2ym/7/)
[14:11:04] <alexwait> wrong selector syntax
[14:11:29] <fourcolors> hi is there anyone that could help me understand the ".change()" function in jQuery?
[14:12:00] <fourcolors> I'm having a hard time understanding why when I change some information in my form the event doesn't get triggered
[14:12:12] <Jak2000> hi all, anyone know ahow to: print 20 lines in a matrix-miniprinter? thanks
[14:12:15] <fourcolors> well thats actually kind of true, i have to click on some other form element before the change happens
[14:12:33] <alexwait> what kind of change are you doing?
[14:12:41] <Slipstream> fourcolors: aren't you looking for keydown or keyup?
[14:13:03] <alexwait> if you're using link() you may want to trigger('change') on keyup
[14:13:40] <fourcolors> Slipstream: well I need to monitor all changes to form elements, I'm making a dirty form checker. Want to see what I have so far? It works fine, except change only works when I click somewhere else after making a change .
[14:14:04] <hightekvagabond> right because the onchange event is triggered by the blur event
[14:14:24] <hightekvagabond> he gave you the right answer, trigger on the keyup event instead of the onchange event
[14:14:46] <fourcolors> hightekvagabond: hum... how do I handle dropwdowns, checkboxes and radio buttons?
[14:15:26] <hightekvagabond> checkboxes and radio buttons have a click event, and dropdowns have a select event
[14:16:12] <Slipstream> fourcolors: you may want to check out knockoutjs if you're doing lots of form stuff, makes it a lot easier
[14:16:29] <fourcolors> Slipstream: ok thank ill check it out
[14:17:08] <ryanneufeld> delegate should work with submit right?
[14:34:26] <MikeGrace> When visiting http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/ the demo is reporting that my browser version number is 535.2 I am seeing this type of behavior on Chrome (Mac), Safari(Mac), and Safari (iPad2). Is this behavior others have seen and reported?
[14:35:17] <MikeGrace> Opera and Firefox are working as expected
[14:35:22] <snover> ?browser @ MikeGrace
[14:35:22] <bot-t> MikeGrace, jQuery.browser: Contains flags for the useragent, read from navigator.userAgent. We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser may be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[14:35:33] <snover> read that over and over again
[14:35:36] <snover> until you stop using $.browser
[14:35:38] <snover> because it is wrong
[14:36:14] <MikeGrace> @snover how do I dynamically change a gradient background correctly for each browser then?
[14:36:28] <snover> what exactly are you trying to do?
[14:36:46] <snover> animate a gradient?
[14:36:59] <MikeGrace> snover: dynamically change a gradient background on user click. No animation needed.
[14:37:27] <snover> use css hooks and feature detection. or, just set with all the prefixes and the invalid ones will be ignored. go look at modernizr to see how it does it if you are confused.
[14:38:03] <MikeGrace> snover: Thanks. I'll check it out.
[14:43:25] <Blaster> how do you store the return data from Ajax into a variable with a bigger scope?
[14:43:39] <Blaster> i want to access it outside of the success function
[14:43:51] <dwarder> i have a bunch of scripts inserted in the head of my page, so of them used, some of them not, what is the best way to find out which of them are not used and remove them?
[14:44:10] <dwarder> if anyone has any idea, please tell :)
[14:46:39] <MikeGrace> Blaster: define the variable you want to save the data to in a different scope
[14:46:49] <MikeGrace> dwarder: I would try stackoverflow
[15:04:44] <yamahaalex> does anyone know a gallery that displays albums in a lightbox, with photos again in a lightbox?
[15:05:22] <appono> Loading jquery from a bookmarklet. What would be the best way to make sure jquery is loaded before the rest of the snippet executes that uses it?
[15:09:46] <newbye> hi guys
[15:09:59] <bl4ckcomb> I'm not guy, pal
[15:10:26] <newbye> gusy and gals then  :)
[15:10:53] <coldhead> how dare you call people gusy
[15:11:19] <newbye> can anyone give me some hint on starting up a dialog from javascript please?
[15:11:34] <newbye> mea culpa people!
[15:12:03] <newbye> and no, i'm not callin' anyone a culpa
[15:12:46] <Daditos> you mean dialog as in alert or confirm box?
[15:12:59] <newbye> a jquery dialog
[15:13:52] <Daditos> have you checked http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/?
[15:14:12] <newbye> $(document).ready(function() {
[15:14:13] <newbye> 		
[15:14:15] <newbye> 		var $dialog = $('<div></div>')
[15:14:16] <newbye> 			.html('some text')
[15:14:18] <newbye> 			.dialog({
[15:14:20] <newbye> 				autoOpen: false,
[15:14:21] <newbye> 				title: 'some title',
[15:14:23] <newbye> 				modal: true
[15:14:24] <newbye> 			});
[15:14:42] <newbye> i want to do something like 'onclick="$dialog.open()"'
[15:15:39] <newbye> as far as i understand $dialog should be visible all acros the file, rite? yet iti is not.
[15:17:31] <igore> !help
[15:17:33] <devnill> Is there a function like $.hide() and $.show() that works left and right?
[15:17:42] <devnill> Or should I just use .animate?
[15:18:47] <igore> I'm building a AJAX app and was wondering at what point will number of server requests start slow down the server.
[15:19:28] <igore> ei: "larger requests, less frequently" obviously this is better for the server, but sometimes its not practical to get all data in one AJAX call
[15:19:38] <newbye> i believe that point depends most on what your ajax asks for
[15:20:28] <igore> When my app loads, it does 8 AJAX calls in total..
[15:21:04] <devnill> is that because it has to be or just convenience?
[15:21:57] <igore> It makes the code more flexible
[15:21:58] <devnill> Does anyone know if there is a horizontal equivalent to hide()?
[15:22:51] <devOlsen> slideUp and slideDown?
[15:22:54] <devOlsen> its not a face though
[15:23:12] <devnill> thats vertical
[15:23:17] <devnill> I want to to be left and right
[15:23:24] <devnill> Its not hard to do with .animate
[15:24:03] <devnill> but i would prefer to use stuff that is already done for me
[15:24:05] <igore> devnill: I think you will have to code it or use a plugin
[15:24:10] <devnill> Ok
[15:24:22] <igore> I have a snippet of code I can show you..
[15:24:31] <igore> I'm currently working on something that does exactly that..
[15:24:44] <devnill> its not hard
[15:24:45] <devnill> I can do it
[15:24:59] <devnill> I just would prefer to use something built in since its already loaded
[15:25:38] <igore> http://jsfiddle.net/Lprx3/
[15:26:42] <igore> devnill: The link above is the code snippet that I'm using to acheave that functionality
[15:26:49] <devnill> Yeah
[15:26:50] <igore> let me know if you need further explaining..
[15:27:00] <devnill> naw, I was just wondering if it existed
[15:27:20] <devnill> I was just looking for an alternative to $.animate()
[15:35:10] <datarecal> hello
[15:35:22] <datarecal> in jquery how would i go about catching the submit but then after the ajax is done actually submit the form normally
[15:37:17] <frenocha> awesome... I just spent twenty minutes trying to figure out why my .load() didn't work. Ten seconds after I join here I realise i'm load()'ing to a just-renamed 404 ;(
[15:38:04] <KWhat_Work> what should i be calling datepicker('dialog' on
[15:40:37] <Emn1ty> So anyone have a suggestion for searching for a random sentence in a massive string? (ie something that starts with a space and ends with a period)
[15:40:42] <winterpk> hi everyone
[15:41:26] <KWhat_Work> Emn1ty: regex
[15:41:47] <dhoss> exit
[15:41:49] <dhoss> gah
[15:41:53] <frenocha> have some / :)
[15:41:55] <Emn1ty> Any particular way you'd loop through it?
[15:42:23] <Emn1ty> I'll ask for the syntax in the regex channel but I'm curious as to how you loop through a large string.
[15:42:51] <devnill> check this out Emn1ty: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[15:43:03] <Emn1ty> thanks, will do
[15:43:19] <winterpk> I'm trying to use a multi selector with .live() and attaching a click event.  My problem is I need to set the data field and send it $(this) as a value.  Here is my code: $("td.week-cell:not(:has(.appt-popup))").live( "click", {apptDiv:$(this)}, apptHandlerRead);
[15:44:31] <winterpk> I relize that, in live scope, $(this) refers to the document window.  But how do I send the clicked element as the data?
[15:45:27] <razzi> that doesnt make sense winterpk
[15:45:39] <razzi> this will be available in the handler function automatically
[15:48:31] <brl0> i'm working with the ui tabs.. i'm about to start working on creating tabs on the fly.. can I control where the panel is attached?
[15:49:01] <brl0> looks like the default 'add' just appends it to the ul's parent
[15:49:16] <datarecal> in jquery how would i go about catching the submit but then after the ajax is done actually submit the form normally
[15:49:57] <razzi> datarecal, what?
[15:50:53] <devnill> you mean like a callback datarecal?
[15:51:04] <ajpiano> datarecal: conveniently, i have a demo of something like that *RIGHT HERE* http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/5tCp3/6/
[15:51:30] <ajpiano> catch submit, do some ajax, trigger native submit in ajax callback ^^
[15:51:31] <KWhat_Work> Emn1ty: there is no looping with regex, you pass it a pattern to match and you pass it a string.  Load your giant string into ram and let the magic happen.
[15:51:46] <KWhat_Work> Anyone know how to use . datepicker('dialog' ?
[15:55:10] <datarecal> perfect thanks ajpiano
[15:56:09] <brl0> I'm not sure about overwriting the tabs add function, but it looks like if I need the panel to appear somewhere else I can attach the panel with the appropriate ID before calling tabs('add')..
[15:56:16] <ColKurtz> yawnn
[15:56:26] <brl0> since it will try to use an existing tabs panel before creating a new one
[15:56:58] <CodeZombie> is there a method in jquery to rotate an image x degrees?
[15:57:04] <CodeZombie> without having to grab an entire plugin
[15:57:26] <Eviltwin> datarecal: This is another way too: http://jsfiddle.net/h54dd/
[15:57:47] <Jon47> CodeZombie, i think you'll want to get a plugin if you want any kind of cross-browser support from older models
[15:58:16] <CodeZombie> Jon47: only concerned about ie9+, ff, chrome, safari
[15:58:55] <Jon47> if you're only interested in the latest browsers, just modify the css property for "transform", e.g. transform: rotate(8deg);
[15:59:25] <Tetraktys> hey guys, i'd like to have a div slideToggle() then update the html and then slideToggle() again, but now as soon as i .html(data) the div it renders completely and ignores the slide effect
[15:59:46] <_thumper_> Hi. I am looking for some JQuery function to display contents of a div (will contain controls) as a modal popup.
[16:00:08] <_thumper_> Any ideas? Would really appreciate them
[16:00:15] <razzi> thumper, fancybox can do that
[16:00:49] <_thumper_> Thanks razzi, will try that
[16:00:59] <Tetraktys> razzi, _thumper_, fancybox is awesome!
[16:01:03] <Jon47> CodeZombie actually, i think you still need vendor prefixes for transform
[16:02:17] <_thumper_> Will fancybox load from a div, or an entire html file? (as an iframe)?
[16:02:47] <Jon47> if oyu just wanna do it one time in CSS you can check css3please.com, otherwise i'd recommend heygradys 2d transform plugin https://github.com/heygrady/transform
[16:03:08] <razzi> thumber, look at its "inline" mode
[16:05:00] <_thumper_> ok thanks
[16:10:16] <nezZario> cupcakes
[16:10:16] <nezZario> k
[16:10:28] <nezZario> im looking for a menu to slide-out to the right
[16:10:54] <frenocha> upon $("#").load("file.php");, the js do not trigger in the file.php I load into the div
[16:11:59] <frenocha> and/or the already loaded js do not trigger on the new content
[16:18:29] <snover> frenocha: you’re doing it wrong.
[16:19:08] <snover> First, don’t use $.fn.load like that, load data using $.ajax normally and insert it yourself. Second, see ?faq events
[16:19:09] <bot-t> First, FAQ: Why do my events stop working after an AJAX request? - http://tr.im/jqfaq2_1
[16:23:03] <Eviltwin> That link didn't work for me
[16:26:16] <frenocha> snover: thanks. sadly that link doesn't load for me though :(
[16:28:10] <snover> http://docs.jquery.com/FAQ#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[16:28:29] <frenocha> ty
[16:29:18] <_thumper_> Ok excuse my newbiness. $("#id").fancybox(); What is the id i need? Of the div? (for inline usage)
[16:29:56] <Eviltwin> snover: Kind of surprised it doesn't show an example with .delegate
[16:31:26] <frenocha> which apparently is .on() as of 1.7 now
[16:32:57] <snover> Eviltwin: you mean like how the first thing it mentions is event delegation and links to the page about $.fn.delegate that contains examples of how to use it?
[16:33:58] <frenocha> .ajax() sure does look like a lot more work to (re)load a specific #div upon an event :(
[16:35:29] <_thumper_> Ok thanks alot razzi, its awesome :)
[16:52:33] <frenocha> .ajax() sure seems like a step too high for me at the moment :(
[16:52:47] <mathi> hi
[16:53:29] <mathi> I need to hide the "tr.filterDuration" elements that have not "duration" + nb class. How can I acheiev this ?
[16:55:38] <Eviltwin> frenocha: I think you mean low :P
[16:55:51] <Eviltwin> nezZario: "duration"+nb?
[16:56:45] <eddiemonge> mathi:  $("tr.filterDuration").not(".duration"+nb).hide()
[16:57:16] <mathi> thank you:))
[16:57:32] <Eviltwin> Or if you're one of those people: $("tr.filterDuration:not(.duration"+nb+")").hide()
[16:57:44] <eddiemonge> that likes slower performance?
[16:58:18] <juanpablob> hello there!
[16:58:26] <frenocha> Eviltwin: i'm fine with the low-level stuff (the actual HTTP requests), I just have no idea how to properly convert my .load() to .ajax() without losing functionality (especially because .live()) now shows up too - but pun appreciated anyway :P
[16:58:43] <frenocha> ^ faulty formatting, ) in wrong place ;(
[16:58:47] <J101_> I'm trying to load a jcarousel slideshow with jquery in Drupal. I hid the div #jslideshow with CSS, but when I try to fade it in, it breaks: http://bit.ly/tZ23y6 ... here is the code: http://pastebin.com/T75fNpGE -- any ideas?
[16:58:48] <Eviltwin> Well you shouldn't use .live() ever
[16:59:00] <J101_> (beginner)
[16:59:02] <Eviltwin> .ajax() is actually used by .load()
[16:59:12] <Eviltwin> So .load() is higher level than .ajax() techincally
[16:59:18] <Eviltwin> Even though it's not as flexible
[16:59:52] <frenocha> Eviltwin: we're talking different kind of levels here. :P I should be using .delegate() instead of .load, right?
[17:00:04] <frenocha> or even .on(), apparently
[17:00:39] <Eviltwin> frenocha: Use .on if it's available (1.7+)
[17:00:42] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate if it's not
[17:00:46] <frenocha> Eviltwin: is there a specific reason .load() is recommended against, other than the deprecated argument (which is a fair argument)?
[17:01:03] <Eviltwin> You mean .live?
[17:01:12] <frenocha> um, yeah... i'm all over the place here
[17:01:25] <frenocha> I meant .live, not .load
[17:01:28] <eddiemonge> J101_: what version of jq does that carousel need?
[17:01:44] <Eviltwin> It's because .live is very misleading and wasteful
[17:01:59] <eddiemonge> J101_: and you have two carousel plugins loaded
[17:02:02] <juanpablob> hi guys! sorry for my bad english! I'm making an ajax website, using hashbang as navigation, like this: domain.com/#!/section/ — and, for some reason when I navigate between sections, the sections loads multiple times, and i don't know how make a 'blend' between bind('hashchange') and window.location.hash — can someone check my code and tell me if detect any error? please?
[17:02:03] <Eviltwin> It (eventually) accomplishes the same goal as .delegate but in a fashion that hides what's really happening
[17:02:06] <juanpablob> http://pastie.org/2978040
[17:02:09] <frenocha> I use .load because i'm simply trying to (re)load a specific div inside a specific div on the page, where .load seems like the shortest route - I use .live because I have no idea what i'm doing
[17:02:16] <Eviltwin> It was originally designed to make it simple for new developers to use
[17:02:23] <heapo__> Hi, i listen to enter-keypress on multiple forms and i'm trying to get the data from the specific form where i filled out the input and pressed enter. My problem is, i don't understand how to get the data from only one of the input forms (every form gets submitted as they have the same name). Maybe i could use the ID in some way, it's always unique (but dynamically added). Would be happy if someone could take a look at my code over here: http://pastebin.c
[17:02:26] <eddiemonge> ugh. hashbang is so horrible
[17:02:29] <Eviltwin> But it ended up causing a lot more problems in the long run
[17:02:44] <J101_> eddiemonge: good point. I will check.
[17:03:01] <frenocha> Eviltwin: such as? because it seems to somewhat work for me right now, but I'd rather not have a broken function/website/marriage because of it any time soon
[17:03:08] <J101_> eddiemonge: where do you see 2? (sorry, I don't know much JS)
[17:03:19] <eddiemonge> frenocha: you are confusing. stop mixing load and live and focus on one issue at a time
[17:03:32] <eddiemonge> J101_: look at the source code or in the console
[17:03:44] <frenocha> eddiemonge: there's only one issue here, i'm needing to use .live() because of a .load() ;o
[17:03:51] <J101_> eddiemonge: thank you -- I will check.
[17:04:22] <frenocha> (or rather, I should use .delegate() on an .ajax() but that's beyond me at the moment)
[17:04:36] <yamahaalex> my site has no styling in IE
[17:04:42] <yamahaalex>  but a pop up for activex/scripts comes up, and if allowed, the style loads
[17:04:48] <yamahaalex> is this the only way?
[17:05:03] <eddiemonge> frenocha: wtf? how are those related? please re-post your issue
[17:05:30] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex: this is jquery. not how IE sucks. although that is discussed a lot. how are you loading the styles?
[17:05:46] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: He's suffering from $("a").bind(...); $("body").load(...); // "A" listener isn't firing
[17:06:11] <Eviltwin> Not that specifically but that idea
[17:06:34] <nawtamac> with multiple word ui widget name, I can't seem to figure out if it should be widgetName or widget-name. Anyone has ideas?
[17:06:55] <frenocha> eddiemonge: there's not as much an issue right now as there's me wondering whether my semi-solution using .live() is a bad idea (and why)
[17:06:59] <marzen> someone mentioned earlier their was a channel for jquery jobs(trying to post a job) but they failed to give me the channel ... anyone know it ... my google fu has failed me
[17:07:03] <eddiemonge> frenocha: what version of jquery are you using?
[17:07:17] <frenocha> eddiemonge: 1.4(.4)
[17:07:19] <eddiemonge> frenocha: yes its bad because live is(will be?) deprecated.
[17:07:22] <juanpablob> as you can see here: http://p.plumon.cl/v6/ the plumon.js file doesn't work very well, try to navigate between sections (is a very simple website, and very simple code)
[17:07:33] <yamahaalex> eddict, this is jquery theme rolled up
[17:07:34] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: It is deprecated
[17:07:42] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: But still part of jQuery
[17:07:49] <Eviltwin> My hope was that they would remove it entirely eventually
[17:07:55] <Eviltwin> But I understand (some of) the reasons against that
[17:08:03] <yamahaalex> eddiemonge, its the index.html of a jquery theme i just made
[17:08:20] <frenocha> i'm using old jquery on this specific page, for compatibility reasons (read: i'm a newbie)
[17:08:27] <eddiemonge> .live() is merely a convenience function for $("body").delegate("element", event, handler). at its most basic
[17:08:53] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: eventually it is going away
[17:09:28] <eddiemonge> frenocha: its time to upgrade buddy
[17:09:29] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: $("foo").live("click",...) effectively calls $(document).delegate("foo","click",...) but not before wasting time generating $("foo")
[17:09:41] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ yamahaalex
[17:09:42] <bot-t> yamahaalex, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[17:10:04] <frenocha> my website is actually at a point of using three different jquery versions right now, just to point out the mess i'm making :o
[17:10:14] <deanclkclk_> has anyone here work with jquery + joomla?
[17:10:18] <eddiemonge> frenocha: omg. time to scrap and reboot
[17:10:29] <eddiemonge> deanclkclk_: yeah then i jumped out a window
[17:10:38] <yamahaalex> eddiemonge, your going to load my site in IE8?
[17:10:39] <deanclkclk_> why eddiemonge ?
[17:11:14] <deanclkclk_> why eddiemonge ? you are still alive so I guess u like the combination
[17:11:47] <frenocha> eddiemonge: time for me to figure out this whole jquery thing properly, as I know next to nothing... i'm learning by looking at others' code and all code seem to appreciate other versions
[17:12:09] <eddiemonge> juanpablob: your load data is getting bound multiple times but other than that i cant help much
[17:12:49] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex: sure why not
[17:13:04] <eddiemonge> deanclkclk_: no i dont. i dont like anything involving joomla. its just so horrible

[17:14:40] <frenocha> I just switched my website to 1.6.2 only, and everything seems to work... so far - imagine that :P
[17:16:12] <eddiemonge> frenocha: why not really take the plunge and go to 1.7.1?
[17:16:20] <eddiemonge> on/off is so worth it
[17:16:54] <frenocha> eddiemonge: i'm running Ubuntu 8.04, i'm not one for plunges apparently :)
[17:17:01] <frenocha> but i'll do that in a few, see what happens...
[17:19:10] <eddiemonge> 8.04 is so weird. like i see it everywhere and more often than any other version
[17:21:56] <joshsmith> how can I pop an item off the end of an array in JS?
[17:24:08] <eddiemonge> pop

[17:24:57] <joshsmith> eddict: I think I need splice somehow?
[17:25:06] <joshsmith> I want to remove one element from the end of the array
[17:25:19] <joshsmith> is it splice(-1, 1)?
[17:25:28] <nawtamac> You really should look at that link joshsmith
[17:25:32] <eddiemonge> its pop
[17:26:03] <joshsmith> but I want the array with the last item removed
[17:26:13] <nawtamac> To clarify, it's the second link.
[17:26:21] <nawtamac> Then do you want the original array to stay the same?
[17:26:23] <joshsmith> hmm I was doing that
[17:26:35] <joshsmith> no I want the original array to have one item removed
[17:26:52] <eddiemonge> then use pop
[17:26:56] <joshsmith> it's not popping at all
[17:27:17] <eddiemonge> ?eval var a = [1,2,3,4,5]; a.pop(); a

[17:28:14] <joshsmith> huh. that's exactly what I'm doing

[17:29:51] <joshsmith> wait, it was popping, it just didn't look like it

[17:30:43] <_thumper_> ah awesome, will install node.js on my vm right now

[17:31:28] <eddiemonge> lol
[17:31:31] <eddiemonge> jk whats up
[17:32:31] <_thumper_> sudo apk-get install wordpress ;p
[17:33:14] <eddiemonge> wordpress isnt always better. sometimes its just s bad. but normally not
[17:35:43] <deanclkclk_> ok in a plugin I have a did $document= &JFactory::getDocument(); $document->addScript("timePicker.js");
[17:35:53] <deanclkclk_> in my timePicker.js eddiemonge  is this
[17:36:01] <eddiemonge> dont paste here
[17:36:05] <deanclkclk_> http://pastie.org/2978093
[17:36:08] <deanclkclk_> sure
[17:36:10] <eddiemonge> whew
[17:36:31] <deanclkclk_> at the buttom of the file u can see alert(jQuery.timePicker)
[17:36:34] <eddiemonge>  i thought you were about to paste all that code into this window
[17:36:36] <deanclkclk_> the alert works right
[17:36:38] <deanclkclk_> but, in my site
[17:36:57] <deanclkclk_> in firebug...when I go console.log(jQuery.timePicker) ...it prints undefine
[17:37:11] <deanclkclk_> any idea what's happening? eddiemonge
[17:37:23] <eddiemonge> do you have the multiple jquery issue? what version of jq is on the site?
[17:37:51] <deanclkclk_> let me see
[17:38:22] <eddiemonge> i would also maybe recommend looking for a different plugin
[17:39:10] <deanclkclk_> eddiemonge: 1.5.1
[17:39:23] <deanclkclk_> it is a plugin that I'm creating
[17:39:27] <eddiemonge> and there is only one jquery version loaded in the page?
[17:39:57] <deanclkclk_> I got that code from here eddiemonge http://labs.perifer.se/timedatepicker/
[17:40:37] <eddiemonge> whats wrong with a simple select?
[17:41:22] <deanclkclk_> yeah eddiemonge ..I check that also
[17:41:26] <deanclkclk_> here's my header http://pastie.org/2978229
[17:41:30] <deanclkclk_> only 1 jQuery
[17:41:58] <deanclkclk_> eddiemonge: could be
[17:42:13] <deanclkclk_> but, wanted to test my hands at some jQuery stuff
[17:42:30] <notbenh> hello all, I'm a perl dev that's trying to collect from a few forms and return it via post. the post part looks easy and straight forward, but in collecting the data I can tell that I'm thinking perlish as I want to build up an array of hashes to return as the data of the post.
[17:42:34] <eddiemonge> for this, i would say a normal select would be sufficient and learn jq on something else
[17:42:44] <notbenh> I'm having a hard time working out how to build these hashes
[17:42:51] <eddiemonge> deanclkclk_: i bet you mootools is hijacking the $

[17:43:01] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[17:43:30] <notbenh> it seems that $array.push({key: $value, key2: $value2}) only seems to return the first pair?
[17:43:52] <notbenh> I'm curious what I'm doing wrong and how I can do things a bit better?
[17:44:10] <eddiemonge> notbenh: what are you trying to do?
[17:44:24] <joshsmith> eddiemonge: btw, thanks for the help with pop
[17:44:31] <eddiemonge> np
[17:44:39] <joshsmith> for whatever reason this Google data I got back was acting up and I had to pop twice
[17:44:46] <joshsmith> I still don't understand why
[17:44:46] <deanclkclk_> yeah eddiemonge the jQuery library that was loaded already has that
[17:44:49] <deanclkclk_> let me show u
[17:44:54] <joshsmith> in the console my objects looked fine
[17:45:02] <joshsmith> but it had an extra value somehow
[17:45:32] <joshsmith> another question: do you all know if it's possible to do some really complex stylings of jQuery UI's autocomplete dropdown?
[17:45:46] <joshsmith> like complex HTML/CSS
[17:45:55] <eddiemonge> joshsmith: yes. there is an example on the demos
[17:46:06] <notbenh> eddiemonge: in short: wrapper_div-> [ widget_div-> form->[input input input], ...] on click build up [{form_one_name=>$val...},...]
[17:46:21] <eddiemonge> joshsmith: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data

[17:46:48] <deanclkclk_> guess it doesn't let me try noConflict

[17:47:13] <joshsmith> eddiemonge: ever used Quora?
[17:47:37] <joshsmith> I'd love to do something like their dropdown
[17:48:19] <eddiemonge> you can do that
[17:48:44] <joshsmith> it's gonna take some time, it looks like
[17:48:48] <dnsdds> How can I make the jQuery UI tabs be full width? i.e. for two tabs width would be 50%, three tabs, 33.3%, four tabs 25% and so on?
[17:53:01] <bonhoffer> how do i refresh a whole form with jquery, i thought $("#my_form").refresh would do it
[17:53:12] <frenocha> .live sure leads to easy endless loops, wee
[17:53:13] <bonhoffer> .refresh();
[17:54:50] <Eviltwin> frenocha: ...what?
[17:55:15] <Eviltwin> frenocha: If you're binding/living/delegating inside a bind/live/delegate, you're (most likely) doing it wrong
[17:55:53] <Eviltwin> frenocha: And if you're binding/living/delegating repeatedly on the same selector, you're (most likely) doing it wrong as well
[17:56:04] <frenocha> Eviltwin: I was triggering a .load() after some .live(), as a sort of callback - which apparently is very, very, very stupid
[17:56:14] <frenocha> on the same selector, indeed
[17:56:51] <_thumper_> Ah trouble :/ Any buttons I add in the fancybox will not do postback
[17:56:56] <_thumper_> I need postback for asp.net :/

[17:57:29] <igore> Need help with callback function
[17:58:09] <igore> I'd like to be able to access the input field (its value) from the call back
[17:58:13] <frenocha> Eviltwin: but so far i've managed to reduce my problems from 4 to 1 - the one being a script not written by me, so it's somewhat understandable :)
[17:59:53] <frenocha> not sure if i'm allowed to ask about it here, as it's not my own code i'm asking about (which seems like an annoying question to answer because of it)
[18:00:26] <eddiemonge> bonhoffer: i think you maybe want reset
[18:01:29] <eddiemonge> igore:  it helps to not have typos when calling the method

[18:12:06] <Evil_Otto> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ <- in the first example, i'm getting the error that .done() is not a function when I try it, am I missing something?
[18:12:18] <Evil_Otto> it doesn't look like .done() is described on that page at all
[18:17:41] <Wardrop> I've created a custom drop-down list. How do I make it disappear when something else on the page is clicked?
[18:18:08] <winudex> wardrop: bind to mouseout ?
[18:18:45] <Wardrop> No, I don't want it to disappear on mouse out. Only when it loses focus.
[18:18:49] <frenocha> so, my final problem: i'm now .load()'ing a .php through a .live('click'), which is all fine. The problem is that I would like to call a method upon success callback. In a normal load() this is no problem, but because i'm doing it in live() I can't seem to figure it out (as it doesn't wait for the load() to finish in the live() event)
[18:18:52] <monokrome> Hey. Is anyone here aware of how I can use a themeroller's development bundle to build a copy of jQuery-UI that isn't minified?
[18:19:04] <Wardrop> The focus and blur events of course dont though, as the drop-down isn't a form field.
[18:19:22] <monokrome> (My webapp will minify it in production)
[18:19:29] <frenocha> (I am calling a #div inside the load(), so the js inside the .php are not called)
[18:19:38] <Wardrop> I've tried using $(window).bind('click', event), but that opens up a whole can of worms. I'm looking for another method.
[18:20:54] <winudex> Wardrop: hmm, yeah i was thinking window onclick as well
[18:21:24] <winudex> err, .click
[18:21:35] <Wardrop> If I bind to window's onclick event from within the click event that trigger the dropdown to display, the window click event is immediately fired.
[18:21:55] <Wardrop> The work-around is to return false from the dropdown click event, but then that has other undeseriable flow on effects.
[18:22:39] <winux> Wardrop: i was thinking of setting a flag and checking if that flag is on or off depending on if your element is displaying as you want
[18:22:58] <Wardrop> Oh yeah
[18:23:07] <Wardrop> That may work
[18:24:03] <frenocha> (also, wow it's easy to convert to delegate()/on())
[18:24:46] <winux> frenocha: why werent you using delegate instead of live?
[18:25:13] <frenocha> winux: I started using jquery maybe last week, and all the stuff i've been reading said for me to use live() until I just joined here :)
[18:25:46] <coldhead> live is simpler
[18:25:54] <winux> frenocha: aha, yeah delegate is supposed to be more efficient amongst other things
[18:26:48] <frenocha> just to make sure, can I rewrite a "$('input.del').live('change',function()" to "$('body').delegate("input.del","change",function()" or would input.del not work there?
[18:27:46] <Wardrop> winux: The flag idea won't work as the window click event is already queued to fire (if that makes sense). I've tried using setTimeout to vind the event, but that doesn't seem to work either for some reason.
[18:28:30] <frenocha> it works, nevermind me. I should just try next time, and type less :)
[18:28:39] <winux> frenocha: my thoughts too ;)
[18:29:40] <winux> Wardrop: So what happens when a non drop-down menu is clicked, besides firing the window click?
[18:30:09] <Wardrop> nothing
[18:31:50] <winux> Wardrop: I must not comprehend the situation entirely.
[18:32:12] <Wardrop> No, that's alright. I may be making progress with setTimeout.
[18:35:01] <Wardrop> Yep, setTimeout did the trick. Even setting the delay to 0 works, as it prevents the event from firing as a result of the click event that created it.
[18:35:30] <Wardrop> (I don't know if jQuery or JavaScript is to blame for that oddity)
[18:35:40] <winux> Wardrop: which event, the window click?
[18:36:45] <Wardrop> Yeah. If I do something like "$(window).click( function () {...})" from within a click event, then this new window click event is fired immediately afterwards.
[18:37:11] <joshsmith> in jQuery UI autocomplete, is there any way to set a minimum start but not have that be the minimum all the time?
[18:37:20] <joshsmith> like I'd like to fire on a change between Sub and Subw
[18:37:28] <joshsmith> but not fire on S
[18:38:52] <winux> Wardrop: interesting, it doesn't sound very smooth to begin with
[18:39:21] <Wardrop> winux: Checkout this example: button.click(function () {
[18:39:22] <Wardrop>   $(window).click( function () { alert('Hello!') })
[18:39:22] <Wardrop> })
[18:39:29] <Wardrop> Whoops, I mean: http://pastie.org/2978403
[18:40:04] <Wardrop> In that example, the event defined on line 2 is fired by the same click event it was created in.
[18:40:09] <winux> yeah the alert pops up
[18:40:33] <Wardrop> It's kind of counter-intuitive
[18:40:58] <Wardrop> It's probably something that varies depending on the JavaScript implementation.
[18:41:06] <winux> Wardrop: so a setTimeout fixes that?
[18:41:11] <Wardrop> Yep.
[18:41:40] <Wardrop> Probably because the asynchronous nature of setTimeout.
[18:41:57] <imsky> ooh ooh
[18:42:11] <winux> Wardrop: and the window click event gets defined?
[18:42:15] <Wardrop> Yes
[18:43:11] <Wardrop> My theory is that by the time the JavaScript schedules the Timeout event, the original click event has finished running all the events.
[18:43:20] <winux> mm something to think about. good to know
[18:47:17] <joshsmith> jQuery UI is still only updating if I change 3 characters
[18:47:22] <joshsmith> *autocomplete
[19:01:42] <patrick99e99> is there a way to
[19:01:44] <patrick99e99> aaah
[19:01:46] <patrick99e99> sorry
[19:02:08] <patrick99e99> I have been reading the api docs trying to find a way to bind an event handler on an element that will exist off and on the page
[19:02:27] <patrick99e99> it seems that .live used to be the way, but it's deprecated?
[19:02:56] <patrick99e99> what I want is basically to have some click event handlers on an element, and be able to remove the element from the page, and then put it back on the page later and still have the same event handler on it...
[19:03:00] <patrick99e99> what is the best way to accomplish this?
[19:04:37] <Eviltwin> patrick99e99: .delegate is what you want
[19:04:58] <Eviltwin> Or you want to use .detach instead of .remove
[19:05:15] <patrick99e99> Eviltwin: so should I use that like $(document).delegate('#my_dom_id', 'click', function() { ... } )
[19:05:35] <Eviltwin> So hold on
[19:05:38] <Eviltwin> You have an element
[19:05:41] <Eviltwin> That has event listeners
[19:05:45] <Eviltwin> You want to remove it
[19:05:47] <patrick99e99> yeah
[19:05:49] <Eviltwin> And then put it back somewhere else?
[19:05:52] <patrick99e99> and then later add it back to the page
[19:06:00] <Eviltwin> And there's one of these elements
[19:06:08] <Eviltwin> Not like 50
[19:06:17] <patrick99e99> there are like 50...
[19:06:26] <Eviltwin> Only one element can have a given ID...
[19:06:35] <patrick99e99> right..
[19:06:40] <Eviltwin> Your example showed an ID
[19:06:48] <patrick99e99> but they aren't going to be on the page simultaneously
[19:06:53] <patrick99e99> so basically, here's what happens
[19:06:57] <patrick99e99> I have a form with elements
[19:07:02] <patrick99e99> these elements have event handlers
[19:07:30] <patrick99e99> clicking on a category element stores the $('form').html() in an object for that given category
[19:07:45] <patrick99e99> so if you fill out the form, and then change categories
[19:07:54] <patrick99e99> the form will totally change
[19:08:07] <frenocha> I have everything working now:) will be buying gold star stickers tomorrow morning to reward myself - thanks to those who suggested I upgrade from .live() to .on()
[19:08:08] <patrick99e99> but if you change back to the original category all your form elements (and what you put in is back)
[19:08:09] <Eviltwin> Is the event handler the same for all of the elements?
[19:08:22] <Eviltwin> frenocha: That was me, I'm accepting donations for my time in here
[19:08:38] <patrick99e99> Eviltwin: the event handlers are different for each collection of form elements...
[19:08:46] <Eviltwin> patrick99e99: Perhaps you could make a small illustration of what you're trying to do in a jsFiddle?
[19:08:52] <patrick99e99> ok
[19:09:01] <Eviltwin> But if I'm understanding you right
[19:09:04] <Eviltwin> You don't want .delegate
[19:09:09] <frenocha> Eviltwin: will be sure to share some gold stars with you when I have them :)
[19:09:14] <Eviltwin> You want to not use .remove()
[19:09:19] <Eviltwin> You want to see ? .detach
[19:09:20] <bot-t> .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[19:09:48] <frenocha> Eviltwin: although, in all fairness, I did fix all of the actual problems myself! so I definitely deserve one star more, perhaps!
[19:11:18] <Eviltwin> frenocha: With that attitude, maybe you can come up with all of the advice yourself next time too :P
[19:11:44] <frenocha> Eviltwin: pfft ;)
[19:12:02] <frenocha> this whole jquery thing is a lot of fun though, I must say
[19:12:13] <frenocha> seems to make a lot more sense than plain ol' js
[19:12:38] <Eviltwin> Well it's a framework
[19:12:51] <Eviltwin> And frameworks are designed to make a certain set of tasks easier
[19:13:10] <Eviltwin> They're not designed to be a language
[19:13:23] <Eviltwin> Which is why we have this
[19:13:25] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs
[19:13:26] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[19:13:34] <frenocha> ha
[19:14:01] <frenocha> that's almost just begging for jquery is java questions
[19:14:12] <Eviltwin> How so?
[19:15:12] <frenocha> I think i'm just a bitter "it's ecmascript, not java!" person :(
[19:16:05] <justinhjohnson> wasn't it Mocha?
[19:16:15] <Eviltwin> Well Java sucks
[19:16:17] <Eviltwin> So...yeah
[19:17:20] <Bankzilla> Eviltwin, is there a read up somewhere of all the bot command features?
[19:17:31] <Bankzilla> Seen so many different ones used today, would love to know some more
[19:17:42] <Eviltwin> Bankzilla: Not really
[19:17:45] <Eviltwin> At least not that I know of
[19:17:50] <frenocha> I must say i'm not a big fan of Java, myself... although there are worse languages out there
[19:18:01] <Eviltwin> frenocha: Few of them, yes
[19:18:38] <frenocha> then again, I like C# which seems to always get people angry as well
[19:18:47] <frenocha> (no idea why)
[19:19:05] <Eviltwin> Because it's terrible
[19:19:19] <frenocha> well, one has to use something at some point! ;)
[19:20:39] <jbkc85> I have a quick question and it has to do with PHP and the use of jQuery Ajax: when calling a PHP page to be loaded in a div, does it not honor the 'includes' and 'requires' in that called PHP script?
[19:20:58] <frenocha> for me XHTML, PHP, C# and python get me about as far as I generally need to go
[19:21:09] <frenocha> (sorry perl)
[19:22:25] <frenocha> TCL, now there's a horrible language *zones out*
[19:25:09] <Eviltwin> jbkc85: AJAX works (almost) exactly like if you visited the page and hit view source
[19:25:26] <Eviltwin> That's what the callback receives
[19:25:54] <jbkc85> hm.  I am using a .load with this site and suddenly the page is having errors; however if I visit the page by itself it works as it did before
[19:26:21] <frenocha> jbkc85: errors?
[19:27:17] <jbkc85> well it talks about how objects aren't being parsed correctly when loaded through Ajax
[19:27:22] <jbkc85> vs loading the page itself
[19:27:49] <jbkc85> all the same files are loaded prior to using the .load call through JS
[19:29:00] <joshsmith> is there any way that I can append something to a UI-autocomplete <ul> after it's finished iterating through the data?
[19:34:39] <jbkc85> ok, apparently the global variables aren't being kept through the ajax call
[19:44:22] <fllr> hey guys. anyone know how to set the 'value' variable of jquery ui's slider on the create() function? ive been trying for a while now and havent got anywhere...
[19:44:42] <fllr> sorry. the 'ui.value' variable...
[19:53:00] <patrick99e99> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/8YcJm/
[19:53:12] <patrick99e99> Eviltwin: that's the best I could come up with for a simple example of what I want..  but-- it may seem convoluted and silly
[19:53:37] <patrick99e99> but basically, I want the happy and sad divs to maintain their click event handler
[19:53:50] <kbeezie> jquery being a pain in the butt with me, I'm trying to get this to work (a simple mock up that i'll elaborate on when I can make it work: http://pbin.be/show/9e8wRhI1xUkfAusegWqS/
[19:54:10] <kbeezie> all I wana do is take an absolute-positioned div, and when I mouse over a link, slide it's left to match the link's left, and it's width to match the links' width
[19:54:21] <kbeezie>  kind of like sliding a background box under a link when I mouse over
[20:03:39] <kbeezie> hrm...
[20:05:57] <patrick99e99> Eviltwin: ?
[20:06:26] <joshsmith> I am trying to do a click event on a button within a jQuery UI auto-complete llist
[20:06:32] <joshsmith> but it's not working
[20:07:08] <mithridates> hey guys, I wanna make a datagrid view; I used jquery.easyui.min.js , is there a better way to do it? it's just for a demo webpage, I want to handle json data and I don't need database connection right now
[20:23:34] <xp_prg> hi all, is there a function that can convert data to like a csv and allow a user to download it?
[20:26:21] <black> Hey is there a place on the web page where to report abuse of use..
[20:28:07] <joshsmith> this is so weird
[20:28:13] <joshsmith> ajpiano: ping?
[20:28:58] <black> look's like a dead irc channel ..
[20:29:15] <miketaylr> ...abusing jquery?
[20:29:44] <black> yes to spam account's in facebook for spam
[20:30:02] <miketaylr> what can jquery do about it?
[20:30:13] <miketaylr> is it hotlinked or something from their site?
[20:30:55] <black> http://justinbieberss.co.cc/1.js
[20:31:20] <miketaylr> sweet url
[20:31:32] <miketaylr> black: there isn't anything that the jquery project can do, unfortunately
[20:31:34] <black> view-source:http://moneueuiww.co.cc/?hl=en-US&gl=US
[20:32:12] <miketaylr> especially if they're hosting the script
[20:32:33] <ngharo> better call the e-police
[20:32:45] <miketaylr> perhaps they're violating FB TOS? report it to them?
[20:32:57] <ngharo> yeah, fb will likely block the offending domain
[20:34:58] <black>  ok just wanted to know  because i reported to fb two time about this and now i trying to find next int he source where the page is hosted last time like 2 min's it was a blog page ..
[20:35:43] <black> here the web page  has rigth click disabled http://moneueuiww.co.cc/?hl=en-US&gl=US
[20:36:17] <black> thanks for the info ..
[20:36:57] <black> exit
[20:51:43] <joshsmith> that was odd
[20:59:15] <joshsmith> if anyone can answer this, that'd be awesome: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8410583/events-not-firing-within-the-jquery-ui-autocomplete-menu
[21:03:18] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Firing events would be .trigger('click') and .trigger('submit')
[21:03:37] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: ah, what syntax do I mean, then?
[21:03:45] <joshsmith> listening for events?
[21:03:48] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:03:53] <Eviltwin> .on('click',handler)
[21:04:01] <Eviltwin> .on('submit',handler)
[21:04:54] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: thanks. updated question to reflect the proper syntax
[21:05:04] <joshsmith> any thoughts on why this is happening?
[21:05:39] <Eviltwin> So first, why are you listening to these events?
[21:06:11] <joshsmith> okay, so I have an <li> as a last item, which has a button of "Add X"
[21:06:35] <joshsmith> I need to listen on that button click, or optionally a form submission
[21:06:45] <joshsmith> so I can handle it
[21:07:06] <Eviltwin> You don't happen to have a live example I can see, do you?
[21:07:22] <Eviltwin> We work best when we can see a demo
[21:07:24] <Eviltwin> ?demo
[21:07:24] <joshsmith> I do, but maybe I should jsfiddle one?
[21:07:25] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[21:07:27] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[21:07:33] <joshsmith> it might be simpler to work with
[21:07:34] <Eviltwin> That's idea
[21:07:45] <joshsmith> let me refactor this code to do it
[21:07:46] <Eviltwin> I usually tell people to see ?jdb
[21:07:46] <bot-t> We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[21:08:02] <joshsmith> yeah, exactly
[21:08:09] <joshsmith> no argument here
[21:09:51] <Eviltwin> Some people come in and say they have no idea where the problem is
[21:09:59] <Eviltwin> But they can't reproduce it on a small scale
[21:10:09] <Eviltwin> And really, they're screwed at that point
[21:10:22] <Eviltwin> Either they need to really dig through it or throw out what they have and start over
[21:11:10] <Eviltwin> And I'll start with a disclaimer
[21:11:18] <Eviltwin> That I don't regularly work with jQuery UI
[21:11:38] <Eviltwin> I've written a few jQuery UI Widgets in the past because I like the way that abstraction works
[21:11:50] <Eviltwin> But I don't use the existing ones very often
[21:11:52] <joshsmith> it'll still be good to put this together regardless, even if you can't answer the question
[21:11:59] <Eviltwin> Yeah, definitely
[21:12:02] <Eviltwin> Never a bad idea to make a jsFiddle
[21:15:53] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/jUsqx/1/
[21:18:05] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: http://jsfiddle.net/jUsqx/2/
[21:18:44] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: what's that doing, exactly? I've never seen that before
[21:18:56] <Eviltwin> This is called the delegate syntax
[21:19:13] <joshsmith> is this relatively new syntax?
[21:19:16] <Eviltwin> So if you have $("a") what does that mean?
[21:19:32] <joshsmith> I mean new as of, say, 1.4+?
[21:19:39] <joshsmith> actually, if it's on, it's 1.7
[21:19:58] <Eviltwin> The delegate syntax was added in 1.4.2
[21:20:05] <Eviltwin> Under the name .delegate
[21:20:11] <joshsmith> aha, that's exactly when I started working with jQuery
[21:20:18] <joshsmith> I never used .delegate much, though, I think
[21:20:18] <Eviltwin> Okay
[21:20:25] <Eviltwin> So let me explain
[21:20:26] <Eviltwin> First
[21:20:33] <Eviltwin> Do you understand what $("a") means?
[21:20:50] <Eviltwin> Or let's make it more interesting
[21:20:53] <Eviltwin> $(".foo a")
[21:20:57] <joshsmith> hopefully. it's a jQuery object containing all of the anchor elements?
[21:21:14] <joshsmith> and that's a jQuery object containing all the children anchors of all the foo classes
[21:21:31] <Eviltwin> It's a little different than that
[21:21:36] <Eviltwin> Well
[21:21:40] <torm3nt> btw eviltwin, I agree with your sentiments about jQuery UI. I find it to be way too heavy.
[21:21:44] <Zebra12> I have a bit of an unrelated question here - but i've been in a debate at work for a while about if some 'double entries' we are seeing (usually a few seconds off) are being caused by users double clicking on buttons in our app.
[21:21:46] <Eviltwin> At least let me make it clearer
[21:21:59] <Zebra12> anyone know of some links about that subject?
[21:22:05] <torm3nt> Zebra12 - reproduce it
[21:22:11] <torm3nt> if you double-click, what's going on?
[21:22:17] <Eviltwin> $(".foo a") constructs a new jQuery object containing all of the descendant anchors of all the foo classes currently in the page
[21:22:42] <Zebra12> in some cases we are talking about a single form post action, and in others we are talking about an ajax request
[21:22:55] <joshsmith> yeah
[21:23:00] <Eviltwin> Which means if I do var x=$(".foo a"); add a new A tag to one of the foo's
[21:23:02] <Zebra12> but i can't make it happen
[21:23:06] <Eviltwin> x doesn't change
[21:23:25] <torm3nt> Zebra12 - you should probably do some uniqueness checks if it's a problem
[21:23:27] <Eviltwin> Now if you do $(".foo a").bind("click",...)
[21:23:44] <Eviltwin> That binds a click listener to all of the a's inside .foo's
[21:23:52] <joshsmith> yep
[21:23:56] <joshsmith> with you so far
[21:24:07] <Eviltwin> If you add new a's or new .foo's or remove the foo classes
[21:24:14] <Eviltwin> That doesn't affect which elements are bound to
[21:24:28] <Eviltwin> The same elements that were selected before are still the ones that have the click listeners on them
[21:24:30] <Zebra12> torm3nt: yeah, i agree - server side checks are the way to solve the issue, but i think fundamentally it is a little strange to think this is possible. making rapid requests like that
[21:24:52] <Eviltwin> Still with me?
[21:24:55] <joshsmith> yeah
[21:25:03] <Eviltwin> Now do you know what event bubbling is?
[21:25:31] <joshsmith> minimally so. I know how to do stopPropagation and all of that
[21:25:42] <joshsmith> I've dealt with it before, but I can't really explain it out of context
[21:25:48] <torm3nt> Zebra12: it happens all the time. Lots of people double-click because that's what they're used to in their desktop environment.
[21:25:58] <Eviltwin> So let's say I have <div><ul><li><span><a>click me</a></span></li></ul></div>
[21:26:00] <torm3nt> 2 ways to get around it
[21:26:10] <Zebra12> but from a request stand point, does it really happen?
[21:26:11] <Eviltwin> And I click the text that says "click me"
[21:26:22] <Zebra12> i mean a form submit is a block request
[21:26:22] <Eviltwin> Click handlers on the A will be triggered
[21:26:26] <torm3nt> 1: disable the object that allows the submission once the first click/submit is done or
[21:26:26] <torm3nt> 2. do uniqueness checks if data ambiguity is an issue
[21:26:26] <Zebra12> blocking*
[21:26:29] <Eviltwin> Then if I don't stopPropagation
[21:26:37] <Eviltwin> Click handlers on the SPAN
[21:26:37] <joshsmith> it'll bubble up
[21:26:41] <Eviltwin> THen click handlers on the LI
[21:26:42] <torm3nt> Yeah but zebra12 - it could also be done seconds apart, maybe cos of a slow connection
[21:26:43] <Eviltwin> Then click handlers on the UL
[21:26:45] <joshsmith> all the way to the document
[21:26:48] <Eviltwin> Yup
[21:27:21] <Zebra12> torm3nt: alright, i just wanted to someone else to tell me it was possible :) thanks
[21:27:31] <Eviltwin> So lets say I want to listen to clicks on all A tags current and future
[21:27:34] <Zebra12> i'll now fix it haha
[21:27:35] <Zebra12> thanks again
[21:27:57] <Eviltwin> I can capture all clicks on the page by binding to the document
[21:28:09] <Eviltwin> And then check if the event target was an A tag
[21:28:15] <joshsmith> ohhh
[21:28:23] <ngharo> Zebra12: I once supported an app on a buggy touchscreen which would, at times, send two clicks on a single touch.  My hack was to bind events with .one() then inside the handler setTimeout to rebind it after 100ms
[21:28:24] <joshsmith> so that's what the delegate is doing
[21:28:26] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:28:32] <Eviltwin> But it has a twist on it
[21:28:36] <joshsmith> so you're bound to the document on load
[21:28:45] <Eviltwin> If I do $(".foo").delegate("a","click",...)
[21:28:47] <torm3nt> nw :)
[21:28:52] <Eviltwin> I bind to all current foo's
[21:29:01] <Eviltwin> And then when clicks bubble up to those
[21:29:07] <Zebra12> ngharo: interesting, good solution to that problem
[21:29:07] <Eviltwin> It checks to see if the target was an A
[21:29:20] <Eviltwin> So part of it is static, the other part is dynamic
[21:29:24] <joshsmith> but binding to the document this way means that you're listening for targets that may or may not yet exist
[21:29:50] <joshsmith> is that right?
[21:29:51] <Eviltwin> Binding to document means jQuery is going to catch all of those events
[21:30:01] <Eviltwin> And then if they match, it's going to call your handler
[21:30:23] <joshsmith> isn't this what .live used to do, though?
[21:30:33] <joshsmith> I thought .on was able to handle what .live does?
[21:30:38] <joshsmith> or am I just completely retarded
[21:31:02] <Eviltwin> $("a").live("click",...) eventually effectively calls $(document).delegate("a","click",...)
[21:31:17] <Eviltwin> But .live is deprecated
[21:31:20] <Eviltwin> And .delegate isn't
[21:31:31] <Eviltwin> Any guesses why?
[21:31:35] <joshsmith> why does .on not do what .live does?
[21:31:48] <joshsmith> erm, not a clue
[21:31:58] <Eviltwin> Okay, so remeber what $("a") does?
[21:32:06] <joshsmith> yeah
[21:32:12] <Eviltwin> It builds a jQuery collection of all the current A tags
[21:32:31] <Eviltwin> It also remembers what selector you used
[21:32:52] <Eviltwin> Then when you call .live, it completely ignores the collection, looks only at the selector, and binds to the document
[21:33:11] <Eviltwin> So say you had like a thousand A tags
[21:33:22] <Eviltwin> It's going to build a collection of all of those A tags
[21:33:35] <Eviltwin> Then throw that away
[21:33:37] <Eviltwin> And bind to document
[21:33:41] <Eviltwin> Very wasteful
[21:34:06] <Eviltwin> It's also very misleading because the syntax is so similar to .bind which doesn't have this property
[21:34:20] <Eviltwin> And .live works quite differently (relies on bubbling)
[21:34:36] <Eviltwin> The delegate syntax makes this a lot clearer
[21:34:46] <joshsmith> ahh I gotcha
[21:34:52] <Eviltwin> And adds the ability to choose the capture point
[21:35:01] <joshsmith> so in the places I would have used .live, I should now use this method?
[21:35:04] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:35:35] <Eviltwin> .delegate can do everything .live can do (and more efficiently in most cases)
[21:35:46] <Eviltwin> And .on can do everything .bind and .delegate do
[21:36:02] <Eviltwin> In fact .bind, .live, and .delegate now internally call .on with the right parameters
[21:36:43] <joshsmith> awesome
[21:36:50] <joshsmith> I really appreciate the thorough explanation
[21:37:27] <Eviltwin> You're welcome
[21:37:33] <Eviltwin> I've had some practice
[21:37:44] <Eviltwin> It's the fifth-or-so time in the last two weeks
[21:37:51] <Eviltwin> So I'm getting pretty good
[21:37:53] <joshsmith> haha
[21:37:59] <joshsmith> do you do front-end work mainly?
[21:38:57] <Eviltwin> I've been all over the place
[21:39:16] <Eviltwin> But in the last few years, I've become increasingly interested in JavaScript and its capabilities
[21:39:21] <joshsmith> do you mind if I ask where you work?
[21:43:12] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: University of Chicago
[21:43:30] <ragas> $('#Pinit iframe').css("width","75px"); will resize the width of my iframe from the prompt, but as the last line of code on the page, nada.  maybe i need some kind of iframe.ready() function?
[21:43:33] <Eviltwin> Also, here's my example for why .live can be misleading: http://jsfiddle.net/8Pn9Y/
[21:43:35] <joshsmith> oh, nice!
[21:44:23] <Eviltwin> ragas: Also put at the last line of your script, alert($("#Pinit iframe").length);
[21:47:14] <ragas> eviltwin: 1
[21:47:39] <Eviltwin> ragas: Huh, then I'm not sure why it's not working
[21:47:47] <Eviltwin> You could try the .ready thing
[21:48:15] <Eviltwin> Actually I think it might need to be .load
[21:48:17] <ragas> that wasnt in the script. i just cmd'd it.
[21:48:35] <Eviltwin> Oh
[21:48:42] <Eviltwin> Try putting it in the script
[21:49:45] <ragas> from the script it returns 0
[21:49:51] <Eviltwin> That's what I suspected
[21:50:06] <Eviltwin> That means the element isn't in the DOM yet
[21:50:10] <Eviltwin> You need to call the .css once it is
[21:51:02] <ragas> i read tha t putting something at the end was the equiv of a .ready, but that doesnt wait for the iframe to load
[21:51:28] <Eviltwin> When do you add the iframe to the DOM?
[21:53:56] <ragas> uhh, earlier in the page.?  I moved all my scripts to the end, to encourage faster pge loading.  but i guess i'll have to try migrating that div load to the top.
[22:00:38] <ragas> hmm, i tried wrapping it in a $('#Pinit iframe').ready(function(){ but still got a 0 back
[22:01:55] <Double_Rainbow> Everyone, save the Double Rainbows, sign the petition http://www.avaaz.org/en/save_the_internet/?cl=1425589399&v=11332
[22:05:31] <Eviltwin> ragas: Try $(document).ready(function(){...})
[22:05:55] <ragas> its already wrapped in a document.ready function
[22:07:00] <Eviltwin> Oh there is something weird about iframe selectors in jQuery
[22:07:04] <ragas> im reading discussions about this, and it might not be doable, since i dont have control over the iframe child contenty
[22:08:21] <jenstechs> hi all. can someone help me apply a jquery each() function to a table of data that is loaded later, via ajax?
[22:09:50] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ jenstechs
[22:09:51] <bot-t> jenstechs, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[22:09:52] <ragas> Its only a problem in IE.  there should be a shortcut for that phrase. #$%^ IE
[22:09:59] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ jenstechs
[22:10:00] <bot-t> jenstechs, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[22:10:17] <jenstechs> Eviltwin: i have no code
[22:10:34] <jenstechs> Eviltwin: i am looking for the solution, that's all
[22:11:10] <Eviltwin> Okay so have you used $.ajax before?
[22:11:56] <jenstechs> sort of, though in this instance i'm calling it via the older-fashioned createRequest and requestreadystate
[22:12:16] <Eviltwin> So you have an onreadystatechange?
[22:12:20] <jenstechs> yep
[22:12:33] <jenstechs> i have a button, button produces table via php/js. jQuery is unable to see this table ID.
[22:12:37] <Eviltwin> And inside there, you're adding the HTML once you've it hits a readyState of 4?
[22:12:41] <jenstechs> yep
[22:13:08] <Eviltwin> *After* you have added the HTML, then you can do the $("table").each(function(){...}) or whatever
[22:13:48] <jenstechs> right, but that js code is in the parent page, and I want it to run automatically when the new table is added. how do i trigger that?
[22:14:05] <Eviltwin> You can't run it "automatically"
[22:14:27] <jenstechs> but, it "should run" somehow
[22:14:46] <Eviltwin> So do this
[22:14:53] <jenstechs> the jquery code loads in parent page, doesn't see new table
[22:15:05] <Eviltwin> Wrap your code in function afterMyAjax() { ... }
[22:15:23] <Eviltwin> Then after you have added the HTML to the page
[22:15:25] <Eviltwin> Call afterMyAjax()
[22:15:59] <jenstechs> call that js function via the js function that handles state 4?
[22:16:19] <Eviltwin> Correct!
[22:17:05] <jenstechs> even though  they're in two separate files? function in ajax.js is included via script tag and afterMyAjax is inline, will it work separated?
[22:17:43] <Eviltwin> jenstechs: When a JS file is progressed, it becomes part of the global JavaScript context
[22:17:59] <jenstechs> Eviltwin: ok just like php, got it.
[22:18:10] <Eviltwin> Just like almost every programming language ever
[22:18:11] <jenstechs> so "div.appendChild(wrap);" then.... just "afterAjax()"
[22:18:20] <Eviltwin> Sure
[22:18:33] <jenstechs> alright, let me see
[22:19:47] <Cork> Eviltwin: thats not really true, most complied languages has file scope
[22:20:06] <jenstechs> hmm. no warnings, no errors, no nothing..
[22:20:13] <Cork> Eviltwin: scripting languages often have a common scope that things are loaded into though
[22:20:30] <Eviltwin> Cork: I was talking about things like C and C++
[22:20:41] <Cork> they have file scope
[22:20:55] <Eviltwin> Oh?
[22:20:59] <Cork> ya
[22:21:01] <Eviltwin> How so?
[22:21:11] <dhw> is there anyway to have two buttons with the same name/id call the same function?
[22:21:21] <dhw> seems only one button will work for me
[22:21:22] <Eviltwin> dhw: You can't have two things with the same ID
[22:21:25] <Cork> Eviltwin: you can declare a varuabke that is global to that file only
[22:21:30] <Cork> *variable
[22:21:33] <dhw> ahh
[22:21:44] <Cork> Eviltwin: that is what file scope is
[22:22:08] <Eviltwin> Cork: Functions defined in one file can be used directly by others
[22:22:16] <Eviltwin> The same way that functions in the file are
[22:22:22] <Cork> sure, but they don't have to
[22:22:29] <Cork> they can be local to that file
[22:23:03] <Eviltwin> Do you have an example of this?
[22:23:08] <Cork> header files (.h) is normaly how you share declarations cross files
[22:23:18] <Cork> but this is off topic
[22:24:06] <Cork> Eviltwin: and no i haven't any c examples around
[22:24:16] <Eviltwin> Once C is linked, it has no reference to the files
[22:24:26] <Eviltwin> All of the function names are global
[22:25:06] <munki> hey all- anyone know of any reason why some jquery code would work when executed in the js console of my browser but not when i put it in a .js file
[22:25:12] <dhw> hm this should work correct $('#oka,#okb').click(hide());
[22:25:14] <Eviltwin> And it's the reason for namespacing function via underscores or whatever
[22:25:24] <Eviltwin> Like gz_open gz_read gz_close
[22:25:32] <Cork> Eviltwin: droppit, its off topic
[22:25:47] <Cork> munki: you might run it before the dom is ready?
[22:25:51] <munki> hmm
[22:25:58] <munki> but it's within the $(function(){ } )
[22:25:59] <munki> block
[22:26:00] <jenstechs> hmm, i can't even get my file to output a simple message to firebug console, no clue whyTHAT's not working :/ larger problems here...
[22:26:03] <Eviltwin> Whatevs
[22:26:38] <Eviltwin> munki: Don't you mean $('#oka,#okb').click(hide())?
[22:26:41] <Cork> dhoss: no your passing the result from function hide() as a callback to click
[22:26:43] <Eviltwin> Unless hide() returns a function
[22:26:47] <Cork> *dhw
[22:27:03] <Eviltwin> Me too
[22:27:08] <Eviltwin> dhw: That was for you
[22:27:28] <sixoh> hey guys, im having trouble with ajaxForm and validate(). basically everything works, except it wont update the target div, which is making my desire to throw my monitor out the window grow with every refresh that passes.
[22:27:29] <sixoh> http://jsfiddle.net/YMpVC/1/
[22:27:38] <sixoh> any help would be much appreciated
[22:28:18] <crab> sixoh: every monitor refresh, or every page refresh?
[22:28:20] <dhw> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Mxhjh5FS - this is what I am trying to do
[22:28:37] <sixoh> thank god its not every monitor refresh, or we'd have a problem
[22:29:01] <crab> :-)
[22:29:06] <munki> like when i execute this: $('#calendar').fullCalendar('addEventSource', '/appointments.json') in my js console in the browser, it works
[22:29:13] <munki> but when i have that in the .js file
[22:29:15] <munki> it doesn't
[22:29:15] <munki> :(
[22:30:24] <dhw> there got it working
[22:30:39] <dhw> stopped using <button> and just did <input
[22:34:21] <sixoh> so, any suggestions anybody?
[22:34:46] <jenstechs> see, not even THIS works..... http://jsfiddle.net/jenstechs/tLsjv/
[22:35:31] <jenstechs> i load jquery in html file, and in inline script, ask it to write to firebug. nada.
[22:36:01] <Eviltwin> jenstechs: If you're going to put the function inside another function, it's not going to be in global scope
[22:36:12] <Eviltwin> So either don't put it in another function
[22:36:16] <Eviltwin> (Probably the best option)
[22:36:32] <Eviltwin> Or use window.afterAjax = function() { ... } instead of function afterAjax() { ... }
[22:36:48] <jenstechs> well, right now i'm not even calling afterAjax, though that is helpful
[22:36:55] <jenstechs> i can't even get "ready" to show
[22:37:05] <Eviltwin> To "show"?
[22:37:19] <Eviltwin> You mean in the jsFiddle?
[22:37:25] <arepie> hello, i would like to ask, how can i make a var name from a variable data? var $(this).val() = 'data';
[22:37:37] <jenstechs> i mean in firebug on my local system
[22:37:51] <Eviltwin> Let me help you out: http://jsfiddle.net/tLsjv/1/
[22:37:55] <crab> sixoh: are you sure it's expecting '#Quote' as the value for target?
[22:38:03] <Eviltwin> arepie: Why?
[22:38:26] <crab> as opposed to $('#Quote') or something (no, that's probably not right. it was just a thought. sorry, i haven't used the validator plugin)
[22:38:49] <sixoh> np, but yes i think thats what it is expecting
[22:39:17] <arepie> Eviltwin: i want the value of the var to become the variable name
[22:39:32] <Eviltwin> arepie: And I asked you, quite simply, "Why?"
[22:40:08] <arepie> Eviltwin: becoz im creating a setTimeout,and i need unique var name for each call
[22:40:20] <arepie> on keyup
[22:40:53] <Eviltwin> Can you show some code of what you're trying to do?
[22:41:21] <arepie> where i can paste?
[22:41:21] <Blaster> hey i have an ajax call with a success callback... so for the callback I just put a function name like ... success: functionName
[22:41:28] <Blaster> now when I'm in function name how do I get the data?
[22:41:34] <Eviltwin> arepie: pastebin, pastie, jsfiddle
[22:42:00] <Eviltwin> Blaster: success: function(data) { /* use data */ }
[22:43:00] <Blaster> im trying to do recursion with my ajax query but each time it gets called 3 extra times
[22:43:09] <Blaster> any idea why?
[22:43:19] <Blaster> the number of extra calls grows exponentially
[22:43:24] <jenstechs> Eviltwin: taking away the document.ready() outside of my code seems to get it to work, even the simple "ready" line. but, when i started a test file and pasted the same lines but oNLY console.log, it worked fine...
[22:43:52] <arepie> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/jG9sTeBU
[22:43:58] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Code?
[22:44:55] <Eviltwin> arepie: Why does that need a unique name?
[22:45:33] <Blaster> Eviltwin: i'll try to seperate that part but it's kind of hard to explain what I'm doing :(
[22:45:35] <arepie> there are many input, and i scared i will collapse
[22:46:27] <Eviltwin> arepie: Each function call gets its own copy of the vars inside the function
[22:48:18] <arepie> Eviltwin: wait let me update the code
[22:49:18] <Eviltwin> Blaster: AJAX calls that make a series of additional AJAX calls on success typically means your server-side needs to be redesigned
[22:50:07] <amitprakash> Hi.. while using jquery.serialize() is it possible to de-select certain serialized fields?
[22:50:45] <Eviltwin> amitprakash: see ?.serializeArray
[22:50:46] <bot-t> amitprakash, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[22:51:14] <Blaster> hey can anyone help with my code?  I'm trying to recursion with ajax but each time it gets called exponentially more times... http://pastebin.com/rzEzYs8d
[22:51:54] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Move the click handler outside
[22:52:01] <arepie> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/RdzRAUHr
[22:53:16] <Blaster> Eviltwin:  Still happens
[22:53:37] <Eviltwin> arepie: Do this: http://pastebin.com/K9r4FN5X
[22:53:45] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Show me what it looks liek now
[22:54:07] <Blaster> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/15krhRY2
[22:54:21] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Not far enough outside
[22:54:28] <Eviltwin> One more layer should do it
[22:54:45] <arepie> Eviltwin: using array, good idea.. thank you
[22:54:55] <Eviltwin> arepie: It's the only sensible idea
[22:55:02] <Eviltwin> Also it needs to be at the scope level I put it at
[22:55:07] <Eviltwin> Any further inside and it won't work
[22:55:07] <Blaster> Eviltwin: Then how does the click handler know the question_id ?
[22:55:23] <sgronblo> Can you rerun a single test in qunit?
[22:56:13] <Eviltwin> sgronblo: Have you read the docs?
[22:56:22] <m0dmd> hey everyone.
[22:57:01] <Blaster> Eviltwin: should that code I showed you be inside a main $(function() {
[22:57:19] <Blaster> because when I moved the clickhandler outside of the nextQuestion function, it's not recognizing the click
[22:57:54] <sgronblo> Eviltwin: hmm, i did a search on the docs page now, but i dont see any rerun links anywhere in my output
[22:58:11] <sgronblo> maybe this is some old version
[22:58:19] <jenstechs> alright, now i'm looking for how to read the value of cells 3-6 (i.e. 2-5) of every row, and i need to color the ones that are "N"
[22:58:25] <jenstechs> http://jsfiddle.net/jenstechs/tLsjv/2/
[22:58:29] <sgronblo> Eviltwin: thanks for the answer
[22:58:50] <sgronblo> Eviltwin: happen to know if it should be available in all versions?
[22:58:56] <jenstechs> this seems to print out every 3-6 column, whether or not it's an N
[22:59:04] <Eviltwin> sgronblo: I've never used it before
[22:59:16] <sgronblo> Eviltwin: ok
[22:59:25] <Eviltwin> Blaster: I don't understand
[22:59:48] <Eviltwin> What happened when it was outside?
[23:00:38] <Eviltwin> jenstechs: You missed a (
[23:00:44] <Blaster> I gotta try a few things
[23:00:51] <Blaster> been workign on this problem for soo long
[23:01:05] <Eviltwin> And also be aware that $("a:eq(1)") can also be done as $("a").eq(1)
[23:02:07] <jenstechs> Eviltwin: bah, you're right, i did. (i tried that way earlier when it wasn't working, i'll put it back that way)
[23:03:13] <jenstechs> though my problem still isn't solved. it's still printing everything.
[23:04:48] <beasty> morning
[23:05:38] <jenstechs> woohoooooooooo it was a typo.
[23:05:41] <jenstechs> thanks Eviltwin :)
[23:05:49] <amitprakash> Eviltwin, thanks... that worked great :)
[23:06:30] <Blaster> Eviltwin: see my question it's in my comment http://pastebin.com/yMdnq6YQ
[23:06:56] <Blaster> now that the clickhandler is outside of the function, how does the clickHandler pass the next "questionId" to continue the recursion?
[23:08:47] <Eviltwin>  Blaster I suggest: http://pastebin.com/gybYCUxS
[23:09:50] <Blaster> thanks I'll try it
[23:12:08] <Blaster> Eviltwin: doesn't seem to be working, the questionId isn't increasing
[23:13:13] <Eviltwin> How were you getting the next question ID before?
[23:13:53] <Blaster> i was just doing ++ on it
[23:14:03] <Blaster> that ajax returns the current question ID
[23:14:09] <Blaster> so with your code it doesnt ever increase
[23:14:15] <Blaster> I think it might need to be questionId = data.id + 1;
[23:14:36] <Blaster> hmm no that didn't do it
[23:15:17] <Blaster> this is what I've got: http://pastebin.com/hRPVGujG
[23:15:59] <Blaster> Here's an example of the ajax returned...
[23:16:03] <Blaster> sorry json*
[23:16:03] <Blaster> {"id":"1","question":"Testing","answer":"false"}
[23:16:30] <Blaster> that would be returned on the very first one
[23:17:15] <Eviltwin> Blaster: http://pastebin.com/P7UnVNNb
[23:18:46] <Blaster> ok will try
[23:18:56] <Blaster> only need the first nextQuestion when the .start anchor is clicked though
[23:19:02] <Blaster> will that affect anything?
[23:19:44] <Eviltwin> Then don't do the nextQuestion(); at the bottom?
[23:19:46] <Eviltwin> I don't understand
[23:20:07] <Blaster> you need to click a button to kick off the recursion
[23:20:17] <Blaster> gunna try your code though 1 sec
[23:20:54] <Blaster> works good now
[23:21:25] <Zogot> Ahoy
[23:22:26] <Eviltwin> Blaster: If you find yourself binding click handlers to a selector inside a function that's being repeated, you're probably doing it wrong
[23:23:17] <Blaster> oh ok
[23:23:35] <Blaster> so the user only has 30 seconds to answer the question
[23:23:44] <Eviltwin> setTimeout is your friend
[23:23:45] <Blaster> so would I just put a setTimeout in the success callback?
[23:23:54] <Eviltwin> Yes
[23:23:56] <Blaster> and would it get reset automatically for the next question?
[23:24:07] <Eviltwin> Not exactly
[23:24:14] <Eviltwin> You'll need to cancel it and start a new one
[23:24:24] <Blaster> hmm
[23:24:31] <Eviltwin> You'll track the timer similar to the way I'm having you track questionId
[23:24:43] <Blaster> clearTimeout ?
[23:24:45] <Eviltwin> And use the way timers work
[23:24:57] <Eviltwin> var <timerID> = setTimeout(function(){...},...)
[23:25:01] <Eviltwin> clearTimeout(<timerId>)
[23:25:08] <Blaster> ok nice
[23:31:22] <sarmiena_> how would i implement arrow scrolling for a fixed-height overflow: scroll element?
[23:32:35] <sarmiena_> i have an <ul> element with lots of <li> tags, but only want to show like 10 at a time. but i want users to have arrow scrolling on the elements
[23:41:27] <k_89> hey .. what's the js-lib used for awesome forms??
[23:41:29] <Ortund> My image gallery uses <td id="1"> (1, 2, 3, 4, etc) to identify which image is being viewed. How can I hide the previous/next buttons if I'm on the first/last image?
[23:46:54] <prodn> How can I delay/wait before I run a function in jQuery? It doesn't seem to work at all. It just skips right to it whatever I try, even if I try regular javascripts wait() or sleep() or setTimeOut()
[23:47:35] <Eviltwin> There is no wait() or sleep() in JavaScript
[23:47:40] <Eviltwin> And it's setTimeout()
[23:47:46] <Eviltwin> And it's asynchronous
[23:48:22] <prodn> ?
[23:48:24] <sarmiena_> is there a way to manually scroll a fixed height element?
[23:48:26] <panfist> i have a link on a page where the url will safely request the contents from the server and display a new page with what the user wants to see,
[23:48:34] <prodn> OKay, I still want to do it in jQuery though
[23:48:44] <panfist> what's the most efficient way to capture that click if js is enabled and stop it from going to a new page?
[23:49:21] <panfist> i have a function that does what i want bound to .click() but after it returns, the browser goes to the other url anyway
[23:49:33] <crab> $('#thatlink').click(function(){return false})
[23:49:42] <crab> panfist: ah, right. return false from the function.
[23:49:51] <panfist> return *false* right...can't believe i forgot that
[23:49:54] <panfist> thanks
[23:50:51] <prodn> $('#search').keyup(function () { setTimeout(alert("test"),3000); }); - this alerts me right away. How should I do?
[23:51:51] <Eviltwin> prodn: $('#search').keyup(function () { setTimeout(function(){alert("test")},3000); });
[23:52:10] <prodn> Eviltwin: will try, thanks
[23:53:22] <k_89> form-enhancing jquery lib anyone??
[23:53:32] <Eviltwin> k_89: It's called CSS
[23:53:33] <Eviltwin> Look it up
[23:54:01] <Spadeski> Eviltwin any ideas on where to begin to build the image slider at the bottom like so http://www.domain.com/
[23:54:02] <k_89> Eviltwin, you ignorant little guy ... there's one with a really weird name ..and it does a lot of awesome shit
[23:54:04] <Spadeski> at bottom
[23:54:33] <Eviltwin> Spadeski: Does it cycle?
[23:54:40] <Spadeski> Nope
[23:55:03] <CodeZombie> how would one go about restoring original scaling after doing a scale effect to 85%? I've tried various values, such as 115%, 120%, but none of them actually revert back to the original. Is this possible?
[23:55:05] <Spadeski> Eviltwin just simple left and right images and slides content
[23:55:06] <Eviltwin> Spadeski: I think this is going to be faster to code than explain
[23:55:25] <Spadeski> Eviltwin either would be deeply appreciated
[23:56:09] <X-Rob> CodeZombie, invert = 85*(100/.85)
[23:56:58] <CodeZombie> X-Rob: so scaling to to the value of invert, with invert being defined before the initial down scale, yes?
[23:57:06] <X-Rob> CodeZombie, ignore that point. Sorry. Typo.
[23:57:24] <X-Rob> yes. if scale = x, unscale = x*(100/x)
[23:58:27] <CodeZombie> X-Rob: the value of 85*(100/85) is 100
[23:58:28] <CodeZombie> :)
[23:58:32] <CodeZombie> which actually doesn't revert
[23:58:35] <Ortund> how do I get the text that inside a <span> tag? var total = $(".total").text(); doesn't seem to work, neither does html()
[23:59:03] <X-Rob> CodeZombie, (100/85) == 117.somethingsomething
[23:59:19] <X-Rob> which is what you actually want
[23:59:20] <Spadeski> Ortund:  Works for me
[23:59:26] <Spadeski> Check your tml
[23:59:26] <CodeZombie> when I ran "invert = 85*(100/85)" in firebug it came out as 100
[23:59:27] <CodeZombie> odd
[23:59:28] <Spadeski>  html
[23:59:48] <X-Rob> ok. yes. I fail at maths. Just scale it by (100/scale)
[23:59:55] <CodeZombie> X-Rob: me too lol
[23:59:58] <CodeZombie> thanks for the tip!
