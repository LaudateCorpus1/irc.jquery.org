[00:20:36] <Snaf> Hi, how can I bind a plug-in to elements loaded by ajax ?
[00:22:43] <ejo> Snaf, do it in the ajax success callback
[00:23:28] <Snaf> Oh, havn't thought of that
[00:23:32] <Snaf> Thanks :)
[00:38:39] <simulation> hello guys, i cant keep animated gifs while page post starts on chrome any one knows to fix it ?
[00:42:19] <raj> oojacoboo, do you have a link?
[00:44:01] <Brainscape> Does using mouseup and mousedown prevent event propigation? My links stop working when I use this piece of code http://jsfiddle.net/CAhTZ/
[00:44:10] <raj> jqui emergency, any big dawgs around?
[00:44:36] <raj> I have an 18hr flight in 2hrs and I'm stuck with a tabs issue
[00:44:45] <raj> would really like to resolve this so I can move forward and do other stuff
[00:44:57] <raj> unfortunately it all depends on the tabs
[00:45:35] <vladyn> guys - stupid questions I know, but how can I get the value of the radio as a number
[00:45:53] <raj> vladyn, what do you mean?
[00:45:55] <vladyn> I have $..change({ }) event
[00:45:59] <vladyn> and inside it
[00:46:13] <vladyn> I mean I have group of 6 radios
[00:46:27] <vladyn> and like to get their value on change
[00:46:38] <vladyn> and *2
[00:46:52] <vladyn> and place the result on other input - total in my case
[00:46:57] <vladyn> simple calculator
[00:47:37] <raj> can you make a fiddle?
[00:47:42] <vladyn> inside change event if I try $("this").va() - I'm getting undefined
[00:47:45] <raj> I'll help you with the js
[00:49:24] <Cronoh> $(this) and $("this") are not the same thing
[00:49:29] <Cronoh> not sure if typo, just saying
[00:50:19] <barrychapman> im having a problem, on part of our site, we get a lot of errors that say $ is not defined
[00:50:26] <barrychapman> even though the JS file is included and accessible
[00:50:38] <vladyn> raj, http://jsfiddle.net/vladyn/Yj8UE/1/
[00:55:44] <raj> vladyn, and what do you want to happen?
[00:56:31] <raj> oh, right, you have single quotes around 'this' in your parseInt() statement
[00:56:34] <raj> just remove the '
[00:56:41] <vladyn> to have in console log one of the ratio values multiplied by 2
[00:57:08] <raj> you are multiplying by 3, btw
[00:57:26] <vladyn> ahh - yea
[00:57:33] <vladyn> the quotes was the issue
[00:57:50] <vladyn> thanks raj - I really appreciate it - I'm such a newbie
[00:58:01] <raj> np
[00:58:26] <raj> Cronoh, caught it first, btw :)
[01:00:04] <Cork> Brainscape: what link is it you're talking about?
[01:04:02] <Brainscape> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/CAhTZ/ I'm implementing a hover effect on mousedown and mouseup because of crazy industrial touchscreens but none of my links work on the page. It works when I add window.location=jQuery(this).attr("href"); on mouseup but that feels wrong
[01:04:57] <barrychapman> has anyone had problems with jquery functions trying to run before jquery is done loading?
[01:07:30] <Cork> ah
[01:07:36] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/CAhTZ/3/
[01:08:39] <Cork> BarryCarlyon: any reason you can't do this in css instead?
[01:09:10] <Cork> BarryCarlyon: only if you don't wrapp them in $(function() {}) or $(doucment).ready(function() {})
[01:09:18] <Cork> opps barrychapman ^
[01:09:50] <Cork> BarryCarlyon: if you move the img into background and switch it through :active
[01:10:02] <Cork> you wouldn't have to use js at all
[01:10:17] <computer2000> anyone knows if there is a possibility to play background html5 videos in mobile safari, like http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js
[01:10:26] <Cork> on the other hand... that prob wouldn't react to touch events
[01:10:29] <Cork> (normally doesn't)
[01:12:00] <Cork> computer2000: sure it just absolute positions the image
[01:12:12] <Cork> s/image/video tag/
[01:12:31] <Cork> there examples are really broken though
[01:12:38] <barrychapman> Cork: ?
[01:12:39] <computer2000> Cork: but will it play?
[01:12:42] <barrychapman> what img
[01:12:47] <Cork> its not image
[01:12:53] <Cork> its just a normal video tag
[01:12:56] <computer2000> huh
[01:13:08] <Cork> <video id="big-video-vid_html5_api" class="vjs-tech" preload="auto" data-setup="{}" webkit-playsinline="" style="position: absolute; width: 1153.4747899159663px; " autoplay="" src="vids/frontier.mp4"></video>
[01:13:28] <Cork> it just relatively positions the rest of the page ontop of it
[01:13:33] <Cork> you don't need js for that
[01:13:35] <barrychapman> has anyone seen issues with very large JS files (including jquery) crashing the js on the page?
[01:13:51] <Cork> no
[01:14:17] <barrychapman> for some reason, my JS file isnt even being recognized by the browser
[01:14:32] <Cork> its most likely not related to the size of the file
[01:14:34] <barrychapman> https://c15157051.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/javascript/8a93054ef68053a1a940c2923cb6a8a5_1355301904.js
[01:15:02] <Brainscape> Cork: I'm trying to reinvent jQuery UI Button interactivity but with images and to change image on mouseup and mousedown. The screens are really bad s√• if I use buttons with text the user might be able to select the text instead of using the button. And you need to press hard so I need the images to change on mousedown and mouseup instead of hover and click.
[01:15:27] <Cork> barrychapman: do you have a link to the problematic page?
[01:15:30] <Brainscape> Since there is no mouse, hover doesn't work
[01:15:40] <barrychapman> hang on
[01:16:28] <Cork> Brainscape: 1. you can use css to disable text selection, 2. if you want image for styling it really belongs in the css, that makes everything easier
[01:16:51] <Cork> ?mdc user-select @ Brainscape

[01:17:02] <barrychapman> cork: it requires a login, do you mind? i can give you the test account
[01:17:14] <Cork> bot-t: thx, for not saying anything about the page -_-'
[01:17:16] <bot-t> Cork, #7535 (Firefox Console error: Unexpected token in attribute selector ... - Opened 3 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7535
[01:17:31] <Cork> barrychapman: no i don't have time for that
[01:17:41] <barrychapman> ok
[01:17:53] <Cork> i need to stay semi focused on my work :)
[01:18:06] <barrychapman> i just have no idea why the JS is breaking on this page
[01:18:15] <barrychapman> it works on every other page throughout the site
[01:18:18] <Cork> barrychapman: what error do you get?
[01:18:33] <Cork> and have you ran the page through w3c validator=
[01:18:35] <Cork> *?
[01:18:54] <barrychapman> yeah
[01:19:11] <barrychapman> there were 3 errors, two of which were missing alt tags, the other was using acronym tag
[01:19:17] <barrychapman> so.. pretty menial
[01:19:31] <Cork> ok
[01:19:37] <Cork> and no console error in the browser?
[01:19:45] <barrychapman> oh a bunch
[01:19:59] <Cork> and the first one was?
[01:20:02] <barrychapman> let me pastie
[01:20:13] <barrychapman> http://pastie.org/5515006
[01:21:15] <Cork> looks like you have cors permissions on the page
[01:21:24] <Cork> restricting js loading
[01:21:42] <barrychapman> why would it be there for this page and no other pages?
[01:22:49] <Cork> barrychapman: also it looks like you're minifier fails
[01:22:56] <barrychapman> how so
[01:23:08] <Cork> you get parsing error in the ckeditor section of that file
[01:23:19] <barrychapman> hmm
[01:23:21] <Cork> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token [ 8a93054ef68053a1a940c2923cb6a8a5_1355301904.js:533 <--
[01:23:25] <Cork> thats in ckeditor
[01:23:49] <Cork> i would start by testing with unminimized files and see if it still crashes
[01:24:13] <barrychapman> ok
[01:24:25] <crooksey_> I have an app that has lots of lists, with ID's that are generated dynamically on the page load, so in my code I have ---    $('ul').sortable();   --- to make all lists sortable, is there anyway I can set it up so I can drag and drop <li> elements between <ul> without defining each ul and li manually in my js?
[01:25:30] <Cork> crooksey_: if they're children of a main sortable you should be able to get somewhat there
[01:26:32] <barrychapman> well shit
[01:26:33] <barrychapman> that fixed it
[01:26:44] <barrychapman> i need a vacation
[01:27:04] <Cork> so ckeditor has a bug that causes the minimizer to break the script
[01:27:12] <Cork> or the minimizer has a bug :)
[01:28:11] <crooksey_> Cork: well there will be say 8 ul's each contaiting around 20 li elements, but the quantaties will change all the time
[01:28:37] <crooksey_> So just wondered if there was an "easy" way to define sorting between two lists
[01:29:03] <Cork> unless they're children of an always existing ul, you will have to bind them with the plugin each time you add them
[01:29:32] <Cork> there's no "monitor" solution for ui plugins
[01:30:02] <crooksey_> Ok, whats the best way to define dragging between uls then?
[01:31:04] <Cork> well connectWith should handle the connection
[01:31:18] <Cork> but you would still have to run the .sortable call on each ul as you add them
[01:31:25] <twisted`> hey, I want to have a menu on a site that starts as a tiny block/button you have to click and then it slides out. Any recommendations what I could use to make my life easier?
[01:31:40] <crooksey_> Cork: ok cool
[01:31:45] <crooksey_> If thats the only way
[01:31:50] <Cork> donno
[01:32:17] <Cork> there's no way to make a ul sortable without making it sortable
[01:32:42] <crooksey_> even with   $('ul').sortable();
[01:32:44] <crooksey_> ?
[01:32:58] <Cork> that only does it on all ul's that are in the dom at that time
[01:33:12] <Cork> if you 3 seconds later add a new ul, it wasn't part of that selection
[01:33:14] <barrychapman> offbeatr.com/explore
[01:33:15] <barrychapman> oops
[01:33:32] <crooksey_> Cork: sorry by the time it gets to there all uls will be on the page
[01:33:57] <Cork> ah, as long as you don't need it to be dynamic, then that makes it a lot easier
[01:34:03] <crooksey_> Yea
[01:34:11] <crooksey_> I like the sound of that :)
[01:34:35] <Cork> $('.sortdrag').sortable({ connectWith: '.sortdrag' })
[01:34:40] <Cork> something like that should work
[01:35:02] <troop> is  if($('#ilce option').val() != -1) right statement?
[01:35:03] <crooksey_> Do I class each ul as sortdrag then?
[01:35:05] <Cork> but read up on the doc was a LONG time since i last diffled with it
[01:35:19] <Cork> troop: for what?
[01:35:31] <Cork> crooksey_: yes
[01:36:01] <troop> i'm trying chained selection, if #ilce's option value is not point to 'please select' information, then i will run the code block
[01:36:22] <troop>  if($('#ilce option').val() != -1) {select state codes}
[01:36:27] <crooksey_> Cork: I have just fallen a little bit in love with you.
[01:36:28] <Cork> then no
[01:36:43] <Cork> troop: selects value is checked on $('#ilce').val()
[01:36:58] <troop> i am trying
[01:37:06] <Cork> so if 'please select' is value="-1"
[01:37:28] <Cork> troop: if($('#ilce').val() === '-1')
[01:38:07] <troop> please select's value is -1 and if it changed i will  operate other codes
[01:38:15] <aqeel> hi room
[01:38:21] <aqeel> hi room
[01:38:36] <twisted`> someone :)
[01:38:41] <Cork> troop: then ya that if i gave you is what you want
[01:38:45] <twisted`> I don't do JS much... I'm more of a backend guy...
[01:39:11] <Cork> twisted`: dig around for examples
[01:39:15] <aqeel> there are plenty of custom scrollbar where scrolling bar scrolls the content but is there any way the opposite where i autoscroll the content and bar scrolls with it too..
[01:39:21] <troop> Cork: if($('#ilce').val() === -1){alert('works');} is not working
[01:39:32] <twisted`> Cork: yeah been googling around for a while... didn't find a concrete example yet :)
[01:39:39] <Cork> twisted`:  you will have to dom some coding, cause i don't thing you will find a plugin that does it
[01:39:44] <Cork> troop: you forgot the string
[01:39:51] <twisted`> Cork: oh that's not the issue
[01:40:00] <twisted`> just that I don't end up re-inventing the wheel
[01:40:05] <twisted`> cause jQuery could already do it partly
[01:40:17] <Cork> jquery could do most of it
[01:40:20] <aqeel> twisted what is that you want
[01:40:21] <Cork> depending on what you want
[01:40:49] <Cork> .animate could do it what ever you want to do
[01:41:15] <Cork> the rest would be a simple trigger for what direction to go
[01:41:30] <Cork> ?.animate @ twisted`
[01:41:32] <bot-t> twisted`, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[01:41:36] <twisted`> aqeel: basically want to slide out a div from *nothing* if I click a button :)
[01:41:42] <twisted`> Cork: cool thanks
[01:41:46] <Cork> uh from nothing
[01:41:48] <Cork> ah
[01:41:57] <Cork> then .show(300) should do it
[01:42:13] <Cork> or slideDown(300)
[01:42:22] <Cork> depending on what direction you want it to animate
[01:42:35] <twisted`> horizontal :)
[01:42:46] <aqeel> first css is display:none and then have animate(),show() fromt he direstion you want or simply grow in ceenter
[01:42:50] <Cork> then a simple show(300) should do it
[01:42:57] <twisted`> cool
[01:43:00] <Cork> no don't display none it
[01:43:02] <Cork> that breaks show
[01:43:03] <twisted`> I'll check out animate and show
[01:43:06] <Cork> use .hide()
[01:43:17] <Cork> ?.show
[01:43:17] <bot-t> .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[01:43:18] <Cork> ?.hide
[01:43:19] <bot-t> .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[01:43:31] <aqeel> wont that cause flash of content
[01:43:34] <Cork> no
[01:43:37] <twisted`> yeah show looks good
[01:43:47] <twisted`> thanks yo!
[01:43:47] <Cork> not if you run it on page load (domready)
[01:44:05] <aqeel> ok then ....twisted hide() animate() show()
[01:44:06] <Cork> and you shouldn't break the page for none js users, just cause you want it to be js flashy
[01:45:29] <twisted`> :D
[01:45:32] <twisted`> gonna experiment a bit
[01:45:47] <Cork> show + hide works well for most cases
[01:45:58] <Cork> but with animate you can get really creative and do most anything
[01:46:19] <ravenzz> anyone familiar with History.js?
[01:46:21] <twisted`> yeah gonna make a test page and see how it goes
[01:46:46] <aqeel> good luck there twisted, happy jquery'ing
[01:46:52] <Cork> ravenzz: somewhat, read through it before i found it to be overhead i didn't want
[01:47:11] <ravenzz> eh
[01:47:51] <NodeX> History.js is a little bloated tbh
[01:47:52] <Cork> ravenzz: i implemeneted it through the native calls
[01:47:59] <ravenzz> I wouldn't use it, but you know...user experience/boss
[01:48:23] <Cork> ravenzz: you can do the same thing it does with quite a few lines of code
[01:48:35] <Cork> or at least the core of what it does
[01:48:42] <NodeX> I did it in about 15 lines
[01:48:51] * Cork nods
[01:48:52] <NodeX> or hat I needed from it I should say
[01:48:54] <NodeX> what *
[01:48:57] <ravenzz> Cork fallbacks included?
[01:49:09] <Cork> that would be for the fallbacks
[01:49:18] <Cork> the native is like 2-3 lines of code
[01:49:21] <ravenzz> I mean normalization etc
[01:49:33] <ravenzz> yeah I know the native is pretty ok
[01:49:53] <Cork> i just added a schime for browsers that didn't have it
[01:49:55] <troop> i'm trying it, i have <select id="x"></select> i want to control that select item whether or not the option element.
[01:49:55] <ravenzz> I read that each implementation are slightly different
[01:50:05] <troop> has
[01:50:16] <troop> i'm trying it, i have <select id="x"></select> i want to control that select item whether or not has the option element.
[01:50:37] <ravenzz> I am facing a problem, with IE in which when the state changes, the url changes to  /foo?page=5#foo?page=6&_suid=135530454120709566802926932987
[01:50:38] <Cork> troop: ah, you want to see if the option exists in the select box, not if its selected?
[01:50:53] <ravenzz> instead of foo?page=6
[01:51:11] <troop> yes i want to control if the option exists or not in the selection box
[01:51:34] <troop> because if i write option -1 in html document, it stays there everytime.
[01:51:44] <Cork> $('#x option[value="-1"]').length > 0
[01:52:21] <ravenzz> I wouldn't mind of the crappy url actually. the problem is that the page's value is again 5 on reload... (quite obvious why)
[01:52:33] <ravenzz> Cork do you mind sharing your implementation?
[01:53:01] <Cork> hmm its quite deeply inbedded in the site
[01:53:06] <Cork> lets see if i can ripp it out
[01:53:10] <cuddle`> hello, I'm trying to bind different events to the .on() function, like so: http://jsbin.com/uxopal/3/edit
[01:53:15] <cuddle`> but it doesn't seem to trigger
[01:53:25] <cuddle`> anyone know how to achieve this?
[01:54:59] <NodeX> '#a, #b'
[01:55:34] <cuddle`> no luck
[01:56:04] <computer2000> how come my html5 video plays a little too fast? also, the timer seems to updated jaggy, sometimes too fast sometimes too late... im on mac current chrome
[01:56:09] <NodeX> ?on
[01:56:09] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:56:09] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised ‚Äúon()‚Äù.
[01:56:11] <bot-t> b-ot, Couldn't find "memorised ‚Äúon()‚Äù." in jQuery Docs.
[01:56:30] <enbergj> $('#a, #b').on('mouseenter', testFunc); $('#a, #b').on('mouseleave', testfunc);
[01:57:06] <cuddle`> enbergj: is that the only way? I remember reading a tutorial kind of site somewhere that did it sort of like I did
[01:57:21] <cuddle`> I can't find it though
[01:57:31] <duderion> hi. what do you use, if you want to print a <table>  ?
[01:58:09] <enbergj> cuddle`: try .on({'mouseenter': testFunc, 'mouseleave': testFunc})
[01:58:41] <cuddle`> thanks enbergj
[01:58:42] <Cork> ravenzz: nope, its fragmented up and embeded in the core of the page
[01:59:08] <Cork> didn't bother to write it as a plugin when i did it
[01:59:21] <ravenzz> np
[01:59:26] <ravenzz> thank you anyway
[01:59:30] <Cork> np
[01:59:40] <NodeX> http://jsbin.com/uxopal/4/edit
[01:59:47] <NodeX> and or that
[02:00:36] <NodeX> you can use space separated events ;)
[02:00:45] <NodeX> "eventsOne or more space-separated event types and optional namespaces, such as "click" or "keydown.myPlugin"."
[02:00:49] <Cork> ravenzz: but basically what i wanted was the hash fallbacks and popstate fallback
[02:00:58] <Cork> i didn't care about the rest
[02:01:22] <cuddle`> ha thanks :)
[02:01:34] <cuddle`> but I seem to have made a bigger mistake, it doesn't log anything
[02:02:17] <cuddle`> oh wait, now it does
[02:02:18] <NodeX> open the firebug consile
[02:02:19] <cuddle`> sweet
[02:02:25] <cuddle`> thanks :)
[02:02:31] <NodeX> when you use on() with body in jsbin make sure you refresh the page
[02:02:37] <NodeX> because it's bound to body
[02:03:31] <cuddle`> aah right
[02:05:15] <troop> $("#ilce option").remove(); is not really remove, option still in source code.
[02:05:29] <SpacePoet> why is jquery so fat nowaday?
[02:05:45] <Cork> troop: dom and source code isn't the same thing
[02:05:47] <NodeX> troop : LOL
[02:06:02] <Cork> troop: source is static from what was sent from the server
[02:06:06] <Cork> dom is what changes
[02:06:57] <cuddle`> NodeX: another quick question, I would like to escape the function like so: http://jsbin.com/uxopal/6/edit - do you know if this is possible?
[02:07:14] <cuddle`> or encapsulate, not sure how to name it
[02:09:04] <NodeX> http://jsbin.com/uxopal/7/edit
[02:09:08] <SpacePoet> how do i ensure that the jquery im getting from other servers aren't compromised??
[02:09:12] <NodeX> try that cuddle`
[02:09:21] <NodeX> you can't
[02:09:26] <NodeX> SpacePoet ^^
[02:10:03] <cuddle`> alright, thank you again
[02:10:07] <NodeX> ;)
[02:10:18] <Mento> Hey guys, I'm stuck with drawing a DIV on my hockeyfield. It start drawing from the top left of my screen. But I actually want to center the div and and give it some margin on top and start from that point. But the coordinates fail. Any idea? Check what I got so far: http://mhcd.eu/koop-een-stukje-veld/
[02:12:48] <Crucials> Hey. I made a sliding window, and i'd like everything outside a certain area to not be visible.. What would be a good way to go about this?
[02:16:10] <troop> Cork: if element removes from dom then it acts like never exists even we see in source ?
[02:17:15] <NodeX> troop : the source is a representation of the dom as a snapshot when the page was loaded
[02:17:44] <Cork> troop: no
[02:17:48] <NodeX> the dom is a live entity that changes, if you wish to see a live version use firebug or it's equivalents
[02:18:52] <troop> is the dom that i see with firefox's view source application?
[02:18:58] <NodeX> no
[02:22:03] <Skizu> Hey not sure if jQuery or PHP question
[02:22:16] <Skizu> Got html I wanna basically save as
[02:22:31] <NodeX> save as ?
[02:22:53] <troop>     function(){
[02:22:53] <troop>         $("#ilce option").remove();
[02:22:53] <troop>         if($("#ilce option")) alert('bok');
[02:22:53] <troop>         }
[02:22:53] <troop> it alerts. :(
[02:23:02] <NodeX> use a pastebin
[02:23:31] <Skizu> Basically I've a html editor, then posting it to server, then wanna auto send back as a file to download
[02:23:51] <NodeX> if($("#ilce option").lnegth) alert('bok');
[02:23:56] <NodeX> if($("#ilce option").length) alert('bok');
[02:24:05] <NodeX> php question
[02:24:59] <troop> hmmm
[02:25:08] <troop> hard to understand for me.
[02:25:53] <Cork> troop: jquery returns an array like object
[02:26:11] <Cork> troop: if it doesn't match anything that array is empty
[02:26:24] <Cork> thats why you need .length
[02:31:56] <fabioportieri> hi
[02:32:18] <fabioportieri> what to do when a simple $('#myDiv').hide(); doesn't work?
[02:33:59] <NodeX> cry?
[02:34:13] <fabioportieri> check
[02:35:00] <shoky> ?demo @ fabioportieri
[02:35:20] <shoky> fabioportieri: reproduce the issue on jsfiddle.net or give us a live link
[02:36:07] <Cork> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/7ajce/
[02:36:22] <Cork> bah old
[02:36:26] <Cork> sorry one sec
[02:37:53] <Cork> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/7ajce/1/
[02:38:18] <Cork> ravenzz: its just the most basic parts though
[02:38:27] <fabioportieri> it may be a struts issue since the name of the page is different dunno what's going on
[02:48:40] <raj> Cork!!!!
[02:48:43] <raj> YES!!!
[02:48:47] <Cork> ?
[02:48:56] <raj> I've got a question sir
[02:49:28] <Cork> sir huh? :)
[02:49:37] <fabioportieri> anyone ever did struts2 + jquery?
[02:52:46] <raj> Cork, I'm having trouble with tabs here --> http://207.38.222.88:8080
[02:53:32] <raj> I'm sure I'm doing something stupid
[02:53:52] <Cork> wheres the tabs?
[02:54:11] <raj> `General`
[02:54:14] <raj> should be a tab
[02:54:39] <Cork> lol it was too big for me :D
[02:54:41] <raj> in fact, if line 21 of chat.js is commented out, and then run after the page is done loading, it works a little better
[02:55:01] <Cork> so whats the problem with it?
[02:55:20] <raj> well, for one, I'm not able to just add a tab
[02:55:30] <raj> type "/join test"
[02:56:49] <Cork> i think i found the tabs plugin in ui way to restrictive os i simply wrote it my self :)
[02:57:04] <Cork> i know i didn't like how it worked back then
[02:57:30] <Cork> (tabs is one of my two hate objects in jquery-ui)
[02:58:20] <Cork> and ya, i think one of its shortcommings is that you can't dynamically add tabs to it
[02:58:27] <raj> 1) what's the other 2) how do you make create a tab like affect, where the bottom border is cut off?
[02:58:31] <Cork> bat least i couldn't find one back then
[02:58:56] <raj> http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation
[02:59:11] <Skizu> What's wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/jwcQq/
[02:59:15] <Cork> 1) accordion, its css rules makes me nuts if you need to net them
[02:59:16] <raj> it has to run .tabs('refresh')
[02:59:49] <Cork> 2) either through background images if you need backwards compat or through border-radius (i did the last)
[03:00:44] <raj> btw, can I download all the jquery and jquery-ui docs anywhere?
[03:00:53] <raj> i'll have no internet access for a long time and would like those as references
[03:00:58] <Cork> oooh  tabs.tabs( "refresh" );
[03:01:00] <Cork> thats a new one
[03:01:12] <raj> ok, so then it's possible :)
[03:01:15] <Cork> hmm might not hate tabs as much as i used to :)
[03:01:18] <raj> without me reinventing the wheel
[03:01:19] <Cork> yup
[03:01:31] <Cork> uh
[03:01:33] * Cork checks
[03:01:40] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/jwcQq/ any ideas why it's not working
[03:02:28] <donkeycongo> How do I detect whether .getJSON() has received an invalid JSON-response?
[03:02:45] <Cork> raj: the "reinvention" of the weel was less then 80 lines of code so...
[03:02:53] <Cork> raj: and ya tabs was another beast back then
[03:03:02] <Cork> (this was for jquery 1.2.3
[03:03:49] <Cork> donburks: .fail(function() {})
[03:04:03] <Cork> donburks: getJSON().fail(function() {}) that is
[03:05:34] <raj> so Cork any idea how to get this thing working?
[03:05:39] <donkeycongo> Cork: That was for me, I presume.
[03:05:40] <raj> using jqui?
[03:05:48] <raj> i feel like i'm not noticing something silly
[03:06:02] <raj> even if I call 'refresh', nothing seems to happen
[03:07:13] <Skizu> What is wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/jwcQq/
[03:07:15] <donkeycongo> Cork: Works great. Thank you.
[03:08:36] <vlad_starkov> Question: I suppose to add custom scroll to my app. What else would you recommend besides http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4 ?
[03:09:57] <raj> also, can I download the jquery docs anywhere? (and the jquery-ui docs, for that matter)
[03:12:10] <gryffus> hello, i am using nivo-slider jquery gallery... Is somewhere list of transition effects _with_ showcase? thank you very much
[03:14:31] <sheilablackrose> .j html
[03:22:04] <Skizu> GRRR WHY DON'T YOU WORK
[03:22:13] <barrychapman> because its  unionized
[03:22:26] <Skizu> What is?
[03:22:31] <barrychapman> whatever isnt working
[03:22:52] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/jwcQq/
[03:22:56] <Skizu> What is wrong with it =[?
[03:23:18] <barrychapman> what happens?
[03:27:14] <gryffus> gryffus: nvm i found it http://siteshowcase.weebly.com/nivo-slider-slice-down.html
[03:29:37] <duderion> is Skizu  data: "name=" + name + "html=" + data,
[03:29:54] <barrychapman> should be & in front of html
[03:30:02] <barrychapman> but thats not the error
[03:30:36] <duderion> there should be a & between
[03:33:27] <barrychapman> and
[03:33:34] <barrychapman> @skizu
[03:33:39] <barrychapman> it should be .val()
[03:33:42] <barrychapman> not .value()
[03:34:15] <barrychapman> change that, and your woes will wash away
[03:35:56] <duderion> jep
[03:36:01] <duderion> that's it
[03:40:58] <mikecmpbll> what would be the best way to find the first <tr> in a table whose 2nd <td> is empty? (.html() == "")
[03:41:06] <mikecmpbll> if that makes any sense at all.
[03:47:47] <raj> can anyone confirm that there is no way to download jq/jqui documentation?
[03:48:46] <tevfik> raj if you are a chrome user. there are cool extensions.
[03:48:56] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone what would be the right way to do a single line multiple if statement in jquery?
[03:49:03] <tevfik> for example jQuery API Browser
[03:49:26] <jarr0dsz> im trying like if(domain != "b.com" || "a.com") {
[03:50:08] <tevfik> jarr0dsz that's not specific for javascript. If course you can..  " if(domain != "b.com" || domain != "a.com") { "
[03:50:29] <tevfik> Of*
[03:50:30] <raj> tevfik, what extensions?
[03:50:48] <tevfik> Chrome Browser
[03:51:21] <raj> there is an extension for chrome browser called "Chrome Browser"?
[03:51:27] <tevfik> I'm using jQuery API Browser extensions. It's fast and gives what i need.
[03:51:42] <raj> I see some chinese stuff
[03:51:49] <duderion> very nice tevfik, api browser...
[03:51:53] <duderion> one more plugin i love
[03:52:10] <tevfik> raj I'm writing it thirt time
[03:52:21] <tevfik> raj jQuery API Browser
[03:52:48] <raj> awesome, I found it
[03:52:50] <raj> thank you!
[03:53:17] <tevfik> Have fun :)
[03:53:34] <raj> I hate to ask this, but this'll work without internet, correct?
[03:55:36] <duderion> nope raj
[03:56:02] <duderion> its online, naturally
[03:56:18] <Skizu> I've an error Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'onChange'
[03:56:20] <Skizu> What does this mean
[03:57:29] <NodeX> you're trying to apply a method to an object that doesn't accept it
[03:57:44] <duderion> Skizu: show the code in jsfiddle
[03:58:32] <Skizu> Ah it's .change not .onChange sorry :p
[04:00:47] <Skizu> Damn now it isn't working, and it's not showing an error haha
[04:05:21] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/F2HGZ/1/ why is change not working
[04:10:39] <Clex> Skizu: it does. When the focus is lost.
[04:11:15] <Skizu> Not for me haha
[04:12:29] <Clex> What browser are you using?
[04:14:34] <Skizu> Hey I've an iframe with the id preview, I'm doing $('#preview').html(); but it's not working any suggestions?
[04:16:26] <iSeeDeadPixels> hey jQuery people :) i'm having a javascript problem, and i'm not good enough at plain javascript on this area, who would like to take a look at my code and edit it for me?
[04:17:06] <Cronoh> ill invoice you
[04:18:06] <Clex> ?ask @ iSeeDeadPixels
[04:18:07] <bot-t> iSeeDeadPixels, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:18:11] <Cork> ?.contents @ Skizu
[04:18:12] <bot-t> Skizu, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[04:18:49] <TomWij> iSeeDeadPixels: I think you forgot to give us the code...
[04:18:54] <Skizu> You're a star :P
[04:20:19] <mikecmpbll> i'm having a bit of trouble automatically scrolling to a point in a div (overflow: scroll). I have <div id="wrap"><table>‚Ä¶</table></div> and I'd like to go to scroll so that a specific <tr> within the table is at the top of the div.
[04:21:30] <williamherry> is this `$(this).first().css("background-color", "red")` ok? why it doesn't change the first child of `this` background color
[04:21:34] <iSeeDeadPixels> TomWij: http://pastebin.com/ycqLc5C9
[04:22:07] <Clex> williamherry: $(this).children(':first').css("background-color", "red")
[04:22:09] <Cork> williamherry: first is a filter
[04:22:18] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://pastebin.com/n8i0gtwd
[04:22:37] <williamherry> oh, Cork Clex thanks
[04:22:38] <iSeeDeadPixels> the question is, how do i pause the loop after pushing the new marker to the array?
[04:22:46] <iSeeDeadPixels> for, about, 1 second or so?
[04:23:07] <Skizu> Ok I've 1 more question
[04:23:18] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: uh thats an object not code
[04:23:27] <Clex> Cork: there's two pastes.
[04:23:38] <Skizu> I've a page that has a jquery request, how do I make it like give me the reply?
[04:24:12] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: two pastes
[04:24:36] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: why do you need to pause it?
[04:24:40] <TomWij> iSeeDeadPixels: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout (In jQuery, there's also http://api.jquery.com/delay/ but that seems irrelevant here and applies more to animations)
[04:24:55] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: its async so you shouldn't do it that way at all
[04:25:50] <TomWij> Cork: Yeah, it's definitely going to require him to rewrite the loop to use setTimeout, or throw increased delays at setTimeout.
[04:25:51] <Cork> you should build a daisy chain function and loop through recursion
[04:26:27] <Cork> TomWij: i think he wants the delay cause of the async call for the geolocation
[04:26:46] <Cork> so settimeout is prob not needed
[04:26:58] <TomWij> Hmm yeah, if you rewrite it to chain that could also be a good approach
[04:27:00] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/RTarQ/
[04:27:20] <Skizu> How do I get the save to work?
[04:28:43] <Cork> Skizu: whats $('#name') ?
[04:29:31] <Cork> ah just an unimportant input field
[04:30:11] <Cork> Skizu: i dont't think you can use .find('html')
[04:30:23] <Cork> contents should be that actually
[04:30:45] <Skizu> It works
[04:30:50] <Skizu> But I mean
[04:30:58] <Skizu> I want it to do like i went to save
[04:31:04] <Cork> wait a min you're putting the content of the iframe inline?
[04:31:07] <Skizu> Because that page makes me download what i had
[04:31:18] <Skizu> No, but idk how to show example >.<
[04:31:55] <Cork> you would have to put the content of the iframe in its own fiddle
[04:32:09] <Skizu> Confused.
[04:33:10] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/4Gv4S/show/
[04:33:10] <Skizu> Idc the contents tbh, I've /save which will return a file with the name that is given and the content of the iframe but idk how to make the ajax return that
[04:33:38] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: because of the 1 request / s cap
[04:33:42] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/RTarQ/2/
[04:34:06] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: ok, then you need the steTimeout too
[04:34:09] <Skizu> I see cork
[04:34:28] <Skizu> So how to I make it work and send me my file?
[04:35:58] <fabioportieri> can you see the issue there? http://jsfiddle.net/f8x8A/
[04:36:01] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: i have no idea on how to achieve the same results with the setTimeout function, i have worked on that snippet for about 4 days now until i got it to work
[04:36:13] <Cork> Skizu: http://jsfiddle.net/RTarQ/3/
[04:36:27] <iSeeDeadPixels> but now i have the problem with the cap from google's side
[04:36:43] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: you need to replace the for with a function that takes the index as a parameter
[04:36:52] <Skizu> Cork, seems the same?
[04:36:53] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: then increase the index
[04:37:42] <iSeeDeadPixels> i have no idea on how to do that Cork
[04:38:34] <Skizu> Cork, I use what you said and I get Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL

[04:55:58] * mikecmpbll tries it
[04:56:01] <Skizu> I post to /save
[04:56:10] <duderion> yep
[04:56:14] <Skizu> It returns a file, I wanna get that file idk how
[04:56:25] <Skizu> I guess I do something in the success: part but idk what
[04:56:43] <seutje> Skizu: ur save method can't return that afaik
[04:57:02] <mikecmpbll> you're correct
[04:57:08] <Skizu> Wtf do I have to do then -.-
[04:57:15] <mikecmpbll> which means i'm calling attr on the original element too
[04:57:15] <seutje> Skizu: ur save method can return the deferred object for the ajax call though, and u can .when() it to run something on completion
[04:57:35] <Skizu> My problem is
[04:57:43] <Skizu> I don't know how the frick to save it
[04:57:46] <mikecmpbll> so I guess i need something like $(selector).wrapInner($("<a>").attr('href', '/'))
[04:57:48] <seutje> Skizu: but then I guess u might as well do that in the success callback
[04:57:52] <mikecmpbll> ok sorted, thanks chaps.
[04:59:09] <seutje> Skizu: what are you trying to do with it?
[04:59:21] <Skizu> I've an iframe with html
[04:59:27] <Skizu> I wanna save the iframes html
[04:59:37] <duderion> to a file on the disc or what
[04:59:45] <seutje> to the server
[04:59:54] <Skizu> To the computer
[05:00:01] <iSeeDeadPixels> nobody? :C
[05:00:09] <seutje> can you stop using vague terms like that?
[05:00:11] <Skizu> Idc about the server, would be easy if was server, just can't save to damn pc xD!
[05:00:19] <seutje> "the computer" being the user's machine or the server?
[05:00:28] <Skizu> The users machine
[05:00:30] <duderion> it must be the users machine
[05:00:44] <seutje> wtf is this ajax shit doing in ur fiddle then?
[05:00:48] <seutje> no wonder I'm all confuzzled
[05:01:02] <Skizu> I was told I have to send to server so that I can save the file
[05:01:21] <duderion> seutje: he sends the iframe's content per ajax to php
[05:01:23] <Skizu> So I made it so it sends to server, but idk how to get it to give me the file with jquery
[05:01:23] <duderion> i guess
[05:01:50] <Skizu> Yeah and then the php has headers to make it download, but idk how to link the ajax to the result of the php so it'll download
[05:01:51] <iSeeDeadPixels> xec: do you have any idea on how to help me?
[05:02:20] <duderion> simply to a tead ajax function in php
[05:02:28] <duderion> and you trigger this via ajax to get the file contents
[05:02:37] <duderion> tead=read
[05:02:45] <duderion> to=do ;]
[05:03:00] <seutje> oh right, I see
[05:03:06] <Skizu> tead?
[05:03:11] <duderion> read function
[05:03:14] <xec> iSeeDeadPixels: nope. but then again i didn't see your question :)
[05:03:32] <Skizu> Where is api for this?
[05:03:38] <sosdiode> ok i did the past bin i saved it under js can some one plz have a look and help me .iam trying to run both scripts the zooming one works but when it tries to load tyhe tape the css file works but the action buttons dont work
[05:03:52] <iSeeDeadPixels> xec: scroll up..?
[05:03:56] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://pastebin.com/ycqLc5C9
[05:03:58] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://pastebin.com/n8i0gtwd
[05:04:01] <iSeeDeadPixels> it should wait one second after adding the marker
[05:04:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> and i have no idea on how to do it or how to use setTimeout in that context, please, someone help me
[05:04:19] <duderion> you don't need api. in phpyou write a function read($filename) { return file_get_contents($filename); }
[05:04:30] <sosdiode> http://pastebin.com/yu83rztZ
[05:05:06] <Skizu> >.< file isn't saved
[05:05:17] <Skizu> File is just a return of the posted data
[05:05:19] <xec> iSeeDeadPixels: that second link is dead, and the first one is something to do with google maps?
[05:05:21] <Skizu> html and file name
[05:05:23] <duderion> ah damn. i'm out..
[05:05:23] <seutje> Skizu: guess u could do it like this then http://jsfiddle.net/RTarQ/4/
[05:06:43] <seutje> Skizu: sorry, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/RTarQ/7/
[05:06:50] <iSeeDeadPixels> xec:  yes
[05:06:59] <seutje> assuming msg is the url the server saved it to
[05:07:00] <Skizu> seutje not working xD
[05:07:45] <iSeeDeadPixels> xec: http://pastebin.com/SeMqvC3j
[05:07:48] <Skizu> The server
[05:07:50] <Skizu> Doesn't
[05:07:51] <Skizu> Save
[05:07:53] <Skizu> The
[05:07:56] <Skizu> File
[05:08:08] <xec> iSeeDeadPixels: what is the code supposed to do? what is working, what is not, what did you expect to happen and what happens instead? and what is your question?
[05:08:32] <seutje> Skizu: you expect us to set up the server for u as well?
[05:08:46] <iSeeDeadPixels> it works, but google caps geocoding requests at 1 per second, i want that for loop to pause after the markerarray.push for 1.1 seconds, how do i do this?
[05:09:01] <iSeeDeadPixels> people told me to use setTimeout but i have no clue how
[05:09:17] <iSeeDeadPixels> quite frankly, i suck at javascript :)
[05:09:30] <seutje> guess I'ma have to pad my ignore list a bit
[05:09:34] <Skizu> I don't want it to save to server
[05:09:50] <Skizu> I just want it to save an iframe html locally....
[05:09:54] <Skizu> Not store it on the server
[05:10:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> Skizu: you want to save the contents of an iframe?
[05:10:11] <xec> iSeeDeadPixels: setTimeout will call a function after a timeout. you can make a function with a settimeout that calls the function it's in. or you can use setInterval instead
[05:10:28] <iSeeDeadPixels> xec: that will break my for loop
[05:10:35] <Skizu> iSeeDeadPixels yeah
[05:10:52] <Skizu> Screw it would data uri base64 stuff work?
[05:11:11] <xec> iSeeDeadPixels: yes. don't do a for loop. you can't 'sleep' in js
[05:11:30] <iSeeDeadPixels> xec: i have to do a for loop to iterate over all 260 markers
[05:12:03] <iSeeDeadPixels> Skizu: extract the url of the iframe's href, save that file.
[05:12:09] <xec> iSeeDeadPixels: no, you can iterate with a recursive function or with setinterval, for instance
[05:12:20] <Skizu> The iframe is dynamically made
[05:12:21] <fabioportieri> can you see the issue there? http://jsfiddle.net/f8x8A/
[05:12:27] <eugene42> Might be something really simple, but I'm trying to print out the json data but having undefined issues. http://jsfiddle.net/S25xD/

[05:13:04] <iSeeDeadPixels> xec: i have no clue on how to do that with the current code i have, sorry
[05:14:28] <fabioportieri> nevermind my issue
[05:15:14] <Skizu> iSeeDeadPixels, that's what I want, where do I find what I gotta do to do that?
[05:18:02] <duderion> eugene42: is the jsondata a local variable in your file ?
[05:18:35] <duderion> or does it come from a request
[05:18:59] <eugene42> passed from a php file, but echoing the jsonencode on the php shows that
[05:19:16] <computer2000> is it right that html5 video timeupdate event only gets fired ~once per second?
[05:20:11] <duderion> and whats item1 item2 ? ;]
[05:21:50] <eugene42> thats just the html text being displayed is it not?
[05:22:10] <duderion> if you want to display the book infos
[05:22:13] <xec> iSeeDeadPixels: google gave me this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1776687/settimeout-inside-for-loop
[05:22:32] <duderion> you should do a for (book in data) and refer to data[book].title
[05:23:12] <duderion> a simple loop over the returned json object
[05:23:25] <Skizu> =/
[05:24:22] <iSeeDeadPixels> xec: i have no idea on how to use that in my code.
[05:25:38] <aaronmcadam> fun

[05:29:24] <Skizu> But there's loads of bs in it xD
[05:32:35] <eugene42> thank you, just a quick query say the xml had changed, how could I make that approach more dynamic so it adapts for other files like is there a way to reference the structure more than the value?
[05:32:55] <bgummadi> guys how can I make it draggable only on the header and not on the content? http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#portlets
[05:33:16] <Skizu> There's a function called downloadFile()

[05:34:40] <hateIE> hi all .. looking for a little file upload plugin like jquploader or something, and Non Flash  .. seems like theres allot of examples out there but they all suffer from some quirk, or short coming or the other I really liked this http://digitarald.de/project/fancyupload/ simple and elegant but it uses frikin mootools ;/ ...
[05:35:35] <hateIE> jquploader looks like its still needs work
[05:36:11] <jeremy-> is there anyway to get similar form elements from jquery-mobile for just jquery or jquery-ui (http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/docs/forms/docs-forms.html)
[05:36:27] <jeremy-> Specifically the flip toggle switch and slider
[05:40:46] <saltcod> I've got a Flash video that I want to come in via a Bootstrap Modal when a user clicks a button.
[05:41:03] <saltcod> Works fine in all new browsers, but not IE7,8.
[05:41:28] <saltcod> It just starts playing as soon as you open the page in IE, instead of starting when the user clicks the link.
[05:41:42] <aaronmcadam> try mediaelement.js
[05:41:44] <saltcod> Is there a way to detach() the video, then "reattach" it when the user clicks the button?
[05:41:57] <aaronmcadam> that doesn't make sense
[05:42:10] <saltcod> aaronmcadam: for sure!
[05:42:13] <aaronmcadam> use a video shim
[05:42:35] <saltcod> like mediaelement?  [ or is that not a shim? ]
[05:42:54] <Skizu> iSeeDeadPeople why do they have the drag listener?
[05:43:05] <saltcod> [ should have included the link as well:   http://blog.distance.mun.ca/technologyresources/guides/the-grades-tool/tour-the-grades-tool/ ]
[05:43:39] <aaronmcadam> salcod: it's a fall-*forward*
[05:43:42] <aaronmcadam> just google it
[05:47:34] <gryffus> how can i reverse animation of nivo-slider? I want "slideInLeft" animation but from right (slideInRight is another effect) Thx for any advice :)
[05:50:00] <gryffus> i tried effect: 'slideInLeft._reverse', but this does not work...
[05:52:05] <Wolf_22> I have a few textareas on the page... Each one has a class. I need to apply some jQuery to each of these, so how would I do this? I'm trying to use an EACH to do this but it's not playing ball...
[05:52:07] <Wolf_22> $('.classname textarea').each(function(){
[05:52:08] <Wolf_22> ...
[05:52:10] <Wolf_22> Would that be right?
[05:54:39] <meilu> depends on what you want to do exactly. the line you gave targets all text area's inside the element with the class "classname"
[05:55:24] <gryffus> is this even possible?
[05:55:51] <meilu> well he could use multiple classes
[05:56:11] <Wolf_22> meilu: Sure but the generic alert I have within the EACH block isn't being tripped... So I guess my element targeting is off...
[05:56:48] <hlveheart> o.O
[05:57:58] <meilu> indeed that would be the first things you would have to check.
[05:58:10] <Wolf_22> Yep, that's all it was. :)
[05:58:37] <meilu> alright
[05:58:54] <Wolf_22> I love this stuff when it works!
[05:58:58] <Wolf_22> lol
[06:00:16] <gryffus> how can i reverse animation of nivo-slider? I want "slideInLeft" animation but from right (slideInRight is another effect) I tried effect: 'slideInLeft._reverse', but this does not work...  Thx for any advice :) (sry for repost)
[06:04:00] <hateIE> http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[06:04:07] <hateIE> :) i knew there was something better out here
[06:16:49] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/Vwgep/ any idea why i'm getting crazy file names?
[06:17:17] <sheilablackrose>  overflow of a column is when it reach it max width n goes below right
[06:18:43] <rayfranco> hateIE thanks for that link ;)
[06:19:27] <eugene42> how can I adapt this for dynamic json content or is it not possible? http://jsfiddle.net/D6RvT/
[06:19:58] <katsh> Sometimes jquery recognizes an #element, sometimes it doesn't. probably because of loading times. How can I make sure that said #element exists before using it?
[06:20:22] <katsh> i mean i am doing if ( $('#element').length > 0)...
[06:20:36] <rayfranco> katsh are you waiting the dom is ready before running your code ?
[06:20:39] <katsh> but if possible i would liek to ensure the element exists, or keep trying to use it until it's available
[06:20:43] <katsh> rayfranco: yes
[06:20:57] <duderion> eugene42: you put the for loop into the $.getJSON
[06:21:07] <duderion> and there you have it
[06:21:25] <duderion> data is the result of getJSON, and you use it in the loop
[06:21:42] <duderion> it's that simple..
[06:22:45] <rayfranco> katsh by doing if ( $('#element').length > 0) you are already testing if the element exists
[06:22:48] <eugene42> could you provide a small example? I understand the logic, but its structuring together thats throwing me
[06:23:23] <katsh> right. and sometimes it does, sometimes it doesnt. i need to ensure it always does, or keep trying to use it until it does
[06:24:14] <rayfranco> katsh you should give us an example of your code
[06:27:22] <iSeeDeadPixels> does anyone know how to flip a background-image horizontally with css/jQuery?
[06:28:16] <fris> what would be the best way to debug this issue, im using a html5 video player, but it only works up to jquery 1.7.1, once i added 1.7.2 or 1.8.x the screen just goes white
[06:28:16] <saltcod> iSeeDeadPixels: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/flip-an-image/ ?
[06:29:13] <iSeeDeadPixels> saltcod: css background image?
[06:29:49] <saltcod> can you transform the div?
[06:29:59] <iSeeDeadPixels> not sure, can i?
[06:30:40] <saltcod> well, you can with transforms, but I'm not sure if it fits your design/workflow
[06:32:02] <iSeeDeadPixels> saltcod: it worked
[06:32:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> thanks

[06:35:07] <saltcod> I can't seem to trigger this video with that Watch Video button: http://blog.distance.mun.ca/technologyresources/guides/the-grades-tool/tour-the-grades-tool/
[06:35:39] <saltcod> Works in Chrome and FF, but not in any versions of IE.    It starts playing the video as soon as the page starts, instead of loading it via the Boostrap modal when I click the button.
[06:35:44] <saltcod> Any ideas?
[06:37:12] <geekluc> as the jquery is minimized?
[06:37:32] <seutje> don't expect ppl to debug entire pages
[06:39:06] <saltcod> If someone had an idea for a general approach it would be great.   I'm obviously not doing it right if the video plays without being triggered.

[07:01:20] <maxmahem> Kyle_Adams: just a general question. Mainly because it doesn't seem to be working for me... hrm.
[07:01:58] <iSeeDeadPixels> maxmahem: "on elements" ?
[07:02:43] <maxmahem> iSeeDeadPixels: that is to say the .on functionality, that is, attach the click even to new elements matching that class.

[08:08:18] <b2l> is your element a select field ?
[08:08:50] <b2l> troop, #ilce
[08:09:05] <computer2000> can anyone tell me if require.js is overkill for medium-small websites or should one only use it for bigger projects, maybe in conjunction with backbone.js or something?
[08:10:01] <troop> yes #ilce is select's id
[08:10:04] <b2l> computer2000, We use it for not that big project, but we build it for production using r.js (see optimisation in requirejs)
[08:10:16] <b2l> troop, and what's not working ?
[08:10:36] <b2l> troop, did your change function get called ?
[08:11:06] <troop> this is chained city selection, working on ff.
[08:13:08] <troop> b2l: when i select a city, ie calls empty select
[08:13:19] <troop> but firefox not. it's working on firefox

[08:14:42] <b2l> troop, ok
[08:17:25] <jholloman> looks like doing a refresh on start solves the issue

[08:24:45] <troop> b2l: okay, by the way, interesting it's working on server
[08:43:00] <prakash_> hi is any body help me in jquery
[08:43:14] <prakash_> how to get the no of ajax requests are running
[08:43:15] <prakash_> ?
[08:43:43] <NodeX> look at ajaxOptions
[08:43:51] <NodeX> iirc there is a global counter
[08:44:06] <prakash_> how can i declare ?
[08:44:11] <prakash_> syntax plz?
[08:45:07] <prakash_> @NodeX,can u plz help ?
[08:46:27] <araneae> I think this might be what you're looking for, prakash_ http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/ajax-jquery-ajax.htm
[08:48:11] <prakash_> @araneae , here i have in datatable onclick   am loading the data
[08:48:31] <mats_> is there any way to see if a h2-tag amounts to more than one "row" in a div? or can you check how many pixels it is or something like that? need to change font size if the h2 gets a second row
[08:48:34] <prakash_> at the same time i dont want allow the user until the ajax response come
[08:49:35] <araneae> You should be able to check the height of the div, mats_ and compare it to your container, but I'm not sure the best way to go about that.
[08:50:51] <mats_> araneae: well, the height of the div is fixed, that's why i need to change font size if it spans more than one "row" in the div. hmm. should be able to do it somehow at least :)
[08:51:35] <prakash_> is anybody have idea about my question?
[08:53:23] <prakash_> hey guys i find that $.active will give u the count of ajax requests in the current page
[08:53:27] <prakash_> thnks guys
[08:53:47] <araneae> Why fix the height of the div?
[08:54:03] <araneae> I'm glad you found it, prakash_. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
[08:54:50] <prakash_> @araneae , its ok i got the solution on web only
[08:58:34] <mats_> araneae: it's a div with opacity over an image. i don't think it will look very good if the the div are smaller or larger on different pictures
[08:59:04] <araneae> Ah, right. Well, the h2 doesn't have a fixed height, does it?
[09:00:51] <mats_> araneae: nope!

[09:14:21] <FGH`> hi
[09:14:31] <FGH`> i'm thinking to make text blink
[09:14:32] <FGH`> http://freegamehosting.nl/test.php
[09:14:36] <FGH`> trying
[09:15:13] <FGH`> can anyone tell me what i'm doing wrong
[09:15:24] <mats_> araneae: this will work, i can just change the class or manually change the style with js if the h2 is higher than 50 px or whatever. thanks :) most visitors will have js enabled so it will be fine. easy solution, harder to do something like this with php i guess.
[09:15:43] <aqeel> hi room
[09:15:50] <araneae> i'm fond of the css method. Have you tried sliding doors if the button's text can change?
[09:15:53] <araneae> And hello, aqeel .
[09:16:11] <aqeel> why is it if i apply css underline it cuts off the text that is ascii character or html code char
[09:16:37] <aqeel> regular text id fine
[09:16:43] <aqeel> is*
[09:16:54] <aqeel> and how can i space it if possible
[09:17:30] <araneae> Try setting the line-height to be slightly larger than your desired text.
[09:17:51] <aqeel> but line height shifts the underscore with it
[09:18:07] <aqeel> line height is for all elements on the line
[09:18:30] <aqeel> abovescore, underscore and text
[09:18:54] <aqeel> well might need to apply hack for such  athing
[09:19:16] <hugo_moss> how do i turn off a general non-delegated event without turning off delegated events?
[09:20:22] <mats_> araneae: solved it already. some times it feels like you actually know how to do things. :) thanks again!

[09:22:40] <defaultro_> hi folks
[09:25:17] <defaultro_> How do I do this? Currently, $('body').append(......................) adds the html output from an external url. I need to update a text before displaying it. What's happening now is it gets displayed since target is the body.  What are some solutions?
[09:26:24] <defaultro_> the tag being added is iframe wrapped in div
[09:26:25] <aqeel> -update text??
[09:26:29] <defaultro_> yes
[09:26:40] <aqeel> ?text()
[09:26:41] <defaultro_> like an <img src="" .....
[09:26:42] <bot-t> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[09:26:45] <Brodingo> a text change should be synchronous
[09:26:47] <aqeel> ?html()
[09:26:47] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[09:27:19] <defaultro_> i mean, is it possible to target a different div before appending it to body?
[09:27:29] <aqeel> yes
[09:27:33] <defaultro_> how
[09:27:35] <Brodingo> but you could inject your new content into a hidden container, make your adjustments, then show it
[09:27:41] <aqeel> assign to target div
[09:27:43] <defaultro_> yeah, that's what I want Brodingo
[09:28:03] <defaultro_> but I don't want to hide body
[09:28:06] <Brodingo> so instead of body use a container
[09:28:09] <defaultro_> ok
[09:28:20] <aqeel> create a div and have it hidden
[09:28:22] <defaultro_> so hide the div first, update the text, then display
[09:28:28] <Brodingo> righto
[09:28:31] <defaultro_> cool :)
[09:28:42] <aqeel> you are welcome
[09:28:54] <defaultro_> now, I would like to dump the the output to a text file so I can see it in raw. How do I do that?
[09:29:19] <defaultro_> i'll try the hidden first :)
[09:31:38] <defaultro_> $('.dialog-header').next().replace("oldtext","newtext");
[09:31:45] <defaultro_> that is right?
[09:32:47] <defaultro_> it failed. It said, replace is not a function
[09:33:12] <araneae> I think it's replaceWith or replaceAll.
[09:33:28] <defaultro_> k
[09:36:25] <defaultro_> can't get the text from this
[09:36:56] <defaultro_> <div class="dialog-header"><h1 class="h2">Sign in to Beta</h1>
[09:37:27] <defaultro_> this is what I am tried, console.log($('.dialog-header').next().text())
[09:37:33] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/R7Erh/
[09:37:36] <defaultro_> this is what I tried, console.log($('.dialog-header').next().text())
[09:37:39] <aqeel> how to solve this
[09:39:03] <aqeel> i do not want the underscore to cut the arrow
[09:39:09] <defaultro_> is it different if it's inside an iframe? I want to access the one inside an iframe
[09:41:29] <halcyon1234> Why do I lose my .on bindings after $.mobile.changePage(OwnURL)?
[09:41:30] <halcyon1234> http://jsbin.com/uzewif/1

[09:45:22] <FGH`> can anyone tell me what i'm doing wrong
[09:46:29] <araneae> You might need the rest of that page...
[09:46:55] <araneae> I'm not sure if it likes not having the html and body tags. I don't know if that would cause your problem, though.
[09:47:30] <FGH`> i only want that text to blink

[10:08:59] <eindoofus> hi, I'm going through the JavaScript courses on PluralSight.com and I'm finishing up the JavaScript fundamentals. I was just wondering which is probably better to learn next, the JQuery course or Knockout course? I hope to learn both eventually.
[10:10:06] <defaultro_> is something wrong with this code, it's still not hiding it, var overlay1 = $('<div style="visibility:hidden;">').attr('class','overlay');
[10:10:32] <BillCriswell> eindoofus: I think it depends on what most of your tasks require you do.
[10:11:53] <eindoofus> BillCriswell, I have no goal in mind yet, just learning. However, I would like to eventually learn how to do HTML5+JS apps. However, I guess at the moment it's more important that I learn something that goes with ASP.Net MVC, which is my main focus of study.
[10:12:45] <Brodingo> defaultro_ i would probably be easier just to have it in the html already, something like <div class="overlay hidden"> and then just removed the hidden class when you need to
[10:13:15] <BillCriswell> eindoofus: I use jQuery every day, can't think of a time I ever needed anything like knockout for day to day use, but I'm sure that's different for different people.
[10:13:37] <defaultro_> tried this, doesn't work, var overlay1 = $("<div>").attr('class','overlay').css('visibility','hidden');
[10:13:57] <BillCriswell> jQuery is also very nice to have on a resume.
[10:15:07] <eindoofus> BillCriswell, yeah, I think I'll go for jQuery first. Thanks for your help :)
[10:15:16] <BillCriswell> eindoofus: No problem!
[10:15:32] <Brodingo> defaultro_ thats sort of bad practice/redundant, if youre manipulating classes you should use the add/remove class methods and if youre already doing that you might as well skip using .css
[10:17:45] <shpank> sup guys. i've got a bit of a problem here. does anybody have an example laying around that describes the use of the vertical jquery slider?
[10:18:02] <shpank> i want to create a web interface for a RGB moodlight but i'm stuck on the web part
[10:18:34] <defaultro_> so how should it look Brodingo?
[10:18:54] <defaultro_> i want to make that div hidden
[10:20:50] <Brodingo> either with a class or css just have it set up already in the html
[10:20:59] <wolfehr> shrank, what issue you having? Getting values out of it?
[10:21:03] <wolfehr> shpank, rather
[10:21:09] <Brodingo> i usually use a class or style attr with display:none
[10:21:25] <iwkse> hi, i'm using jquery 1.8.16 with a slider embed in woocommerce but it is not working...it seems something is not properly recognized, i have an error like m is undefined. any hint would be welcome to fix that weird issue
[10:21:52] <shpank> wolfehr: i really don't know how to start and i haven't found a complete example on how to use all this stuff
[10:21:59] <Brodingo> and you can just have $overlay = $('.overlay') so you can append into it and show it
[10:22:10] <shpank> a simple html page with one vertical slider would suffice
[10:22:45] <wolfehr> shrank, you just need to initialise the slider, and bind a function to the change event. the second argument passed to it, ui, will have a property value (ui.value) which indicates the current value of the slider
[10:23:12] <shpank> alrighty, but how do i initialise it
[10:23:24] <wolfehr> shpank, have you used jquery before?
[10:23:31] <shpank> not really
[10:23:39] <shpank> just a lot of copypaste and praying :)
[10:23:56] <wolfehr> how are you using this value to set the value of your rgb moodlight?
[10:24:49] <shpank> wolfehr: i'm writing an ajax application which sends a string via serial to an arduino
[10:24:55] <shpank> which is plugged into my router
[10:25:16] <shpank> basically it wouldn't even need to be all that ajax-y
[10:25:20] <wolfehr> so you have a compiled app that is linked to the web server, yeah?
[10:25:40] <shpank> not right now. i'm starting that when i have the ui ready
[10:25:51] <shpank> because when the ui is done, it's gonna be a piece of cake
[10:26:26] <wolfehr> fair enough, you asked a jQuery question, so I'll leave that bit to you (hoping you have all bases covered)
[10:26:55] <shpank> yeah i did such things before. everything that's missing for a wonderful user experience are those sliders
[10:27:04] <shpank> typing in numbers is pretty crappy on a mobile device :)
[10:27:51] <wolfehr> shrank, what values you setting? 0 - 100?
[10:28:02] <shpank> 0-255
[10:28:15] <wolfehr> ah, you have 3 then I guess
[10:28:21] <shpank> yes.
[10:28:24] <shpank> RGB :)
[10:28:39] <wolfehr> I was thinking brightness for some reason‚Ä¶. it's late
[10:29:32] <shoky> shpank: you need an example of how to setup the slider?
[10:29:45] <shpank> shoky: yes
[10:29:58] <shoky> shpank: and the jquery-ui examples on jqueryui.com are no good?
[10:29:59] <shpank> a page with just the working slider would be most wonderful
[10:30:17] <wolfehr> how the hell do you add query ui in jsfidde.net?
[10:30:17] <shpank> shoky: if you would provide me with a link, i would be very happy :)
[10:30:32] <shoky> shpank: http://jqueryui.com/slider/#slider-vertical
[10:30:38] <wolfehr> I've put a demo together for him, just can't add the damn jqueryui library
[10:30:54] <shoky> here's a demo.. http://jsbin.com/ogokux/1/edit
[10:31:01] <shpank> oh wow
[10:31:02] <shpank> thanks
[10:31:06] <shpank> this looks promising
[10:31:07] <shpank> finally :)
[10:31:20] <defaultro_> so folks, I have the imaginary div name. The external url output html is now inside this hidden div :) Now, how do I change a text inside this imaginarycontainer? This is how I made the div. <div id="ImaginaryContainer" class="hidden"></div>
[10:31:57] <wolfehr> shrank, I've added in the change function for you so you can see how to get the value out
[10:32:16] <wolfehr> goddamn autocorrect‚Ä¶ is shrank a word then (shrank keeps getting autocorrected)
[10:32:29] <lxsameer> how can i select a tag that don't have a certain class
[10:33:22] <shoky> lxsameer:  which element do you wanna select?
[10:34:24] <lxsameer> shoky: i want to select all the div elements that don't have "XYZ" class
[10:34:31] <shoky> oh
[10:34:46] <shoky> lxsameer: there's .not()  and :not selector
[10:35:08] <shoky> lxsameer:  $('div:not(.XYZ)')  for example
[10:35:11] <shpank> alright!
[10:35:13] <lxsameer> shoky: thanks man
[10:35:15] <shpank> shoky: thanks for the link
[10:35:20] <shoky> npnp
[10:37:47] <wolfehr> shpank, $('div').not('.XYZ') works well as well, bit more readable too
[10:42:31] <MrFox> hi guys
[10:42:48] <MrFox> i'm looking at the code on this page: http://www.jquery4u.com/function-demos/ajax/
[10:43:22] <MrFox> there's a selector: $('#'+id+' .content1')
[10:43:49] <MrFox> what i do not understand is how 'id' gets the value
[10:43:52] <alaing> hey ppl
[10:43:58] <MrFox> anyone?
[10:44:13] <defaultro_> folks, this is the object. How can I access this via jquery? hackedOutput[0].parentElement.outerHTML.replace('oldstring','newstring')
[10:44:24] <alaing> MrFox: can you explain more pls?
[10:45:05] <wolfehr> MrFox, the element gets an id by defining it in HTML <div id="whatever"></div>
[10:45:23] <alaing> defaultro_: what is it returning?
[10:45:25] <NoiseEee> MrFox: its passed in the function
[10:45:34] <defaultro_> it's the html output which i need
[10:45:35] <defaultro_> :)
[10:45:41] <defaultro_> but i need to modify a string there
[10:45:42] <MrFox> NoiseEee, what calls the function?
[10:45:51] <wolfehr> MrFox, ah, I see the code, it's supplied as the first parameter of the callback
[10:45:52] <alaing> so like a <div> in a string format?
[10:46:18] <defaultro_> the code i posted works in firebug console and it replaces the string
[10:46:25] <shpank> how can i change the what's in a div?
[10:46:49] <shpank> in the example at http://jqueryui.com/slider/#slider-vertical the value is written in an input
[10:46:56] <shpank> but i just want to write it into a div
[10:47:08] <kryl> hi, please how to select the DIV directly around an input selector ?
[10:47:13] <shoky> shpank: you can change element's text with .text(...)
[10:47:21] <shoky> ?jqf @ shpank
[10:47:24] <bot-t> shpank, jQuery Fundamentals, a free online intro to jQuery - http://jqfundamentals.com
[10:47:28] <shpank> oh cool
[10:47:29] <wolfehr> shrank, inputs are more sane for taking values than divs
[10:47:30] <shpank> thanks
[10:47:34] <alaing> defaultro_: can you stick up an example on jsfiddle?
[10:47:34] <NoiseEee> MrFox: presumably an event handler on the button that loads the new stuff
[10:47:38] <defaultro_> k
[10:48:25] <NoiseEee> defaultro_: if you make your element via jquery $ syntax, you can update the text easily before its in the DOM
[10:49:35] <alaing> NoiseEee: well said
[10:50:02] <alaing> anyone going to the jquery UK conf in 2013?
[10:50:04] <MrFox> NoiseEee: they could've only used class to target that button with jquery, i do not see y they used id in the selector. i noticed there is space involved ' .content1'
[10:50:46] <MrFox> so this should mean: target that class withing that id
[10:50:52] <MrFox> *within
[10:50:57] <NoiseEee> MrFox: thats what it means, yes
[10:51:07] <alaing> MrFox: ID works faster than class
[10:51:17] <NoiseEee> MrFox: its quicker for the browser to find #id.class rather than entireDocument.class
[10:51:31] <alaing> MrFox: only use class if you likely to have more than oone element with the same name
[10:52:04] <Eiam> is 'jstree' still the fallback for a tree type module?
[10:52:04] <alaing> NoiseEee: Agreed. Thats because its very specific
[10:52:33] <alaing> Eiam: I used another tree plugin before
[10:52:47] <MrFox> but i see no ID-ed DIVs wrapping my buttons
[10:53:24] <shoky> Eiam: i use it ;p
[10:53:25] <Wolf_22> Is there a best way to "un" sync 2 scrolling elements that have been synced using scrollTop() or scrollLeft()?
[10:53:33] <alaing> MrFox: without seeing your code its hard to tell
[10:53:35] <NoiseEee> MrFox: your buttons?
[10:53:37] <Eiam> shoky: is it just me or is there a lot of contradicting documentation
[10:53:48] <shoky> Eiam: mmm didnt notice that
[10:53:51] <MrFox> here: http://www.jquery4u.com/function-demos/ajax/
[10:53:56] <NoiseEee> MrFox: use whatever selector makes sense for your code.  that example is using what makes sense for their code.  the ID in their example is "ajax"
[10:54:03] <Eiam> e.g. you can have "data": "Name" or "data":{title:"blah",icon:"/path"}
[10:54:05] <shoky> Eiam: but so far i haven't needed to configure it too much
[10:54:05] <alaing> MrFox: best best to put up an example in jsfiddle.net
[10:54:07] <MrFox> click the demo
[10:54:17] <shoky> Eiam: how is that contradictory?
[10:54:24] <shoky> Eiam: you just have more than one way to do it
[10:54:33] <defaultro_> NoiseEee: I'll try that
[10:54:35] <MrFox> and: run demo
[10:54:50] <shoky> Eiam: if all you want is just a title , then just give a name.. if you need it to also have attributes/icon/whatever, then you give the full object
[10:54:55] <Eiam> shoky: sometimes you have "title" sometimes title
[10:55:05] <Eiam> its not clear when you need "attribute" and when attribute is okay
[10:55:09] <defaultro_> NoiseEee: isn't it how I made it?  var hackedOutput = $("#ImaginaryContainer").append(overlay1,this.overlayContainer(options));
[10:55:11] <alaing> MrFox: around the "Load" content buttons?
[10:55:12] <shoky> Eiam:  that's clear if you know javascript
[10:55:31] <shoky> Eiam:  { key: value, key2: value2 }
[10:55:34] <MrFox> yes, alaing
[10:55:40] <alaing> there is a div
[10:55:43] <defaultro_> and I see the hackedOutput object in Firebug
[10:55:46] <MrFox> which one?
[10:55:49] <alaing> called "ajax"
[10:55:50] <Eiam> shoky: except data is also in a hash and requires the quotes..
[10:55:58] <shoky> Eiam:  keys can be with quotes or without, it doesnt matter (if they have special characters/spaces they need to be quoted)
[10:55:59] <Eiam> { "data":{title:"my title"}}
[10:56:18] <shoky> Eiam:  {"data": ...}  is exactly the same as  {data: ...}
[10:56:26] <shoky> Eiam: that's a javascript fact. has nothing to do with jstree
[10:56:35] <alaing> MrFox: so #ajax .btn would return three buttons
[10:56:35] <Eiam> weird, i could have swore last night i was getting frustrated at it working with in some cases, without in others
[10:56:41] <defaultro_> NoiseEee: the path where the string is at hackedOutput[0].parentElement.outerHTML
[10:56:44] <MrFox> so 'ajax' is getting concatenated within my event handler's selector each time?
[10:56:46] <Eiam> shoky: which yes, would be odd (hence why i called it out..)
[10:56:50] <Eiam> maybe it was just alte ;)
[10:56:51] <Eiam> late
[10:56:53] <shoky> :p
[10:57:20] <defaultro_> and this.overlayContainer(options) is actually from an iframe
[10:57:22] <NoiseEee> MrFox: it is in that example
[10:57:30] <alaing> <div id="ajax" is wrapping your content
[10:57:32] <NoiseEee> defaultro_: sorry please fiddle
[10:57:43] <MrFox> yes, NoiseEee, it is in that example
[10:57:44] <defaultro_> k
[10:58:09] <MrFox> code is unde CODE section in the bottom of that page
[10:58:21] <MrFox> *under
[10:58:40] <NoiseEee> MrFox: so whats your question??
[10:59:12] <MrFox> where from does it get the id?
[10:59:24] <MrFox> i see no functions grabbing the attributes
[10:59:33] <MrFox> *html attributes
[10:59:53] <MrFox> and the click is on the button with a class attribute, no id
[11:00:06] <NoiseEee> MrFox: its probably on the initial event handler that tells those buttons to do things
[11:00:40] <MrFox> do you guys know a good tutorial on ajax() function? this one blows :(
[11:01:26] <MrFox> and i don't want those get() and post() stuff, i want a real ajax() function
[11:02:34] <shoky> Eiam:  er, you might've been getting errors when using {data: ...}  if you do that in your JSON response
[11:02:47] <shoky> Eiam: {data: ...}  is valid JS,  but not valid JSON. JSON requires the quotes
[11:03:14] <alaing> MrFox: Straight from the horses mouth http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:03:18] <Eiam> maybe that was it
[11:03:52] <MrFox> anything shorter than that? :D
[11:04:09] <alaing> MrFox: It might be initialised in http://www.jquery4u.com/scripts/function-demos-script.js
[11:05:30] <MrFox> i see
[11:05:39] <alaing> Yes there is a helper function in there :
[11:05:46] <alaing>  /* helper function to strip the main id for the demo */
[11:05:48] <alaing>     getId: function(elem)
[11:06:15] <alaing> so element is passed it in strips out the id and returns the variable called id

[11:11:52] <saltcod> Trying to load a video in a modal. Triggered when a user clicks a button.  Problem is, in IE, the video doesn't start/stop with my button trigger. It just plays continuously.
[11:12:23] <saltcod> I'm trying to:     clone() it when the page loads, quickly remove() it, then load it back in again when the user clicks the trigger button
[11:13:16] <saltcod> But I can't figure out the "load it back in part"   ‚Äî appending it to itself gives me a HierarchyRequestError  =)
[11:16:34] <ogk1000> shoky, sup dude
[11:16:41] <ejo> saltcod: perhaps you want detach() rather than remove()?
[11:16:54] <saltcod> perhaps
[11:17:21] <saltcod> I wouldn't need to clone, etc then?

[11:46:53] <jasonthesensei> random javascript question from a noob. Is there away to use javascript to check to see if a file exists. For instance have it read through my head tag and say If <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"  /> doesnt exist create the file for me?

[11:48:00] <frewsxcv94709> I'm trying to retrieve the viewport height. I heard that "$(window).height()" should work. When I first load the page, it returns the correct height, but if I resize the browser/window, $(window).height() returns the height of the entire document. Does this sound right?
[11:48:30] <jasonthesensei> R00tk3y: could you pm me i have more questions if you are willing to help.
[11:51:56] <NoiseEee> jasonthesensei: no, that is not possible with JS alone.

[12:23:14] <shoky> with the commas
[12:23:20] <katsh> thank you
[12:24:17] <shoky> frewsxcv94709: that's weird.. i dont understand why jquery is doing the wrong thing
[12:24:34] <shoky> it's getting document.documentElement.clientHeight  instead of window.innerHeight
[12:25:02] <shoky> the former is for IE i thought
[12:25:35] <alaing> anyone going to jquery uk conference in 2013?

[12:42:15] <pikpik> Hi. With jQuery Mobile, how would I use JavaScript to set a footer's data-position attribute to be fixed or to not exist?
[12:44:49] <pikpik> I'm currently toggling with these two statements, but I'm not seeing much of a difference:
[12:44:54] <pikpik> $("[data-role=header]").fixedtoolbar({ position: "fixed" });
[12:44:55] <pikpik> $("[data-role=header]").fixedtoolbar({ position: false });
[12:45:14] <pikpik> s/header/footer/
[12:49:39] <hugo_moss> what happens if you try to turn off, or remove a handler thats not attached in the first place?
[12:50:12] <hugo_moss> will it return gracefully?
[12:51:07] <lordvishal> Hi =)
[12:51:15] <RifatNabi> hello :P
[12:52:23] <pikpik> hugo_moss: Sorry, I'm not quite sure what you mean.
[12:52:26] <pikpik> When I try to turn it off using JavaScript, nothing appears to happen.
[12:52:27] <pikpik> Or, did you mean to remove the data-position attribute in the HTML?
[12:53:03] <pikpik> I'm also not sure what kind of handler you're referring to.
[12:55:08] <hugo_moss> pikpik, sorry that question was for my own informational purposes
[12:55:23] <lordvishal> I thought it'd be fun to open up jQuery.js and see how it is implemented. But it's too complicated because I'm a n00b. I was wondering if someone could point out some of the concepts / patterns used in the creation of jQuery. It would be awesome to be able to understand how jQuery is organized, for example.
[12:55:31] <pikpik> hugo_moss, oh, ok.
[12:55:50] <lordvishal> *ducks*
[12:58:33] <pikpik> hugo_moss, ok, when I start out without data-position in the HTML, the toggling by JavaScript adds the effect of the attribute. But then setting it to false doesn't disable it.
[12:59:18] <omnipotent1> anybody use the infinitescroll plugin by paul irish?
[13:06:15] <enderx86> I have a JSON that looks like var json = { key : {key2: value} }. How can I change this to { key: [{key2 : value}] }     i.e. the value is an array of objects, not an object
[13:06:27] <enderx86> Do I have to create a new JSON variable, or can I modify the original JSON (var json) in-place?
[13:06:46] <zhulikas> json.key = [json.key];
[13:08:25] <lordvishal> Hi folks - I'd love it if someone could point me in the right direction with this:  I would like to understand how jQuery is implemented. I opened up the jquery.js file and saw massive wall of code. What patterns / concepts should I understand in order to be able to read jQuery.js?
[13:09:20] <monk3y> Minification.  You've probably opened jquery*.min.js?  It's been 'compacted' for a lighter load on the "internet pipes".
[13:09:44] <monk3y> Jump on the jquery website and download the original/unminified (?) version.
[13:10:48] <frewsxcv94709> shoky: I simplified the code, in case you're curious http://rwell.org/albums/
[13:14:39] <lordvishal> monk3y: hehe.. no no, I was looking at the full version - just need to understand some of the concepts used in programming jquery...
[13:15:05] <lordvishal> monk3y: for example: methods that execute as soon as they're implemented‚Ä¶ ie. the first line: (function( window, undefined ) {
[13:15:14] <hugo_moss> i have two divs. each div has an animating menu. you can animate each menu by clicking on it. there is a third div, with buttons that when clicked, animate both menus.  how can i turn the div with buttons-on/off, when an animation is in progress, and then finished, in either menu div?
[13:15:16] <monk3y> Oh haha.  So you were looking at the 'prettier' wall .. but a wall for someone looking at it for the first time eh.
[13:16:47] <monk3y> Well they may not be executed right there and then; I think you'll be talking about anonymous functions, which are defined without name because you're not going to invoke them arbitrarily yourself over and over.  Where that's defined should be inside some event that will trigger it throughout the lifetime of the page.
[13:17:23] <monk3y> So it could very well be upon page load ($(document).ready(*)), or .click(), or more generally .on(), etc.
[13:18:05] <monk3y> (NOTE: I'm a relative n00b, I'm just spouting what I think I've read/heard/implemented myself a few times and not seen any bugs, heh)
[13:19:23] <lordvishal> monk3y: this helps, man‚Ä¶ thanks‚Ä¶ also, let me copy and paste what PigDude over in the Javascript room told me:
[13:19:41] <lordvishal> PigDude: lordvishal, this is just a weird way to initialize variables. if you look to the end of the file, you will see })(something, something);
[13:19:41] <lordvishal> [1:16pm] PigDude: lordvishal, it is an IIFE: a function that executes itself immediately.
[13:19:43] <lordvishal> [1:16pm] PigDude: lordvishal, as in (function() {})()
[13:19:44] <lordvishal> [1:17pm] lordvishal: Ah, thank you thank you
[13:19:46] <lordvishal> [1:17pm] locci: TheWarden: what is the matter? It seems fine to me
[13:19:47] <lordvishal> [1:17pm] PigDude: lordvishal, if I want to define var x in the function, I can do this: (function(x) {})(1);
[13:19:49] <lordvishal> [1:17pm] PigDude: and x will be 1, just like if I called the function
[13:19:50] <monk3y> Wait wait
[13:19:50] <lordvishal> [1:17pm] PigDude: (because I did)
[13:19:52] <lordvishal> [1:17pm] PigDude: lordvishal, (window, undefined) is a way of defining `undefined' in case it has been overwritten in some other code.
[13:19:52] <monk3y> Don't paste!
[13:19:53] <lordvishal> [1:18pm] PigDude: >> typeof (function(undef) { return undef; })(); @ lordvishal
[13:19:54] <monk3y> Stooooop
[13:19:55] <lordvishal> [1:18pm] ecmabot: lordvishal: (string) 'undefined'
[13:19:55] <lordvishal> [1:18pm] PigDude: lordvishal, note that in this case i can use `undef' as my `undefined'. the same idea.
[13:19:56] <lordvishal> [1:18pm]
[13:19:58] <monk3y> omg
[13:20:00] <lordvishal> Sorry >.<
[13:20:04] * monk3y breathes
[13:20:27] <lordvishal> Thats is all..
[13:20:30] <monk3y> I feel like I'm at an internet party at someone's house, and you just got massive Tourette's.
[13:21:01] <hugo_moss> anyone have any idea how i can go about that?
[13:21:48] <monk3y> hugo_moss: sorry man, got distracted by lordvishal.
[13:21:55] <hugo_moss> how can i use a function that returns a promise, but is attached with an on/off handler
[13:21:59] <hugo_moss> im trying to think
[13:22:19] <monk3y> Umm.  Depends on how you want to 'deactivate' the divs, but I think the easiest impl is just $('#divId').toggle()?
[13:22:24] <hugo_moss> i have two divs. each div has an animating menu. you can animate each menu by clicking on it. there is a third div, with buttons that when clicked, animate both menus.  how can i turn the div with buttons-on/off, when an animation is in progress, and then finished, in either menu div?
[13:22:36] <monk3y> Yeah I saw it in the buffer dude, thx.
[13:22:41] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[13:23:13] <monk3y> So yeah maybe a callback that re-enables divs, handing it the ID/IDs of the div(s) to re-enable.
[13:23:22] <MistuhKurtz> wow, flexbox is pretty awesome
[13:23:23] <monk3y> How are you animating the menus?  Javascript?
[13:23:33] <hugo_moss> jquery
[13:23:45] <hugo_moss> fade ins
[13:23:46] <MistuhKurtz> now, should I follow through and use flexbox for a production website?
[13:23:49] <monk3y> Heh yeah, as opposed to Flash or Silverlite or something arcane.
[13:24:21] <hugo_moss> monkey, toggle turns off the visibility right
[13:24:28] <hugo_moss> i want to just notify when the animation is done
[13:24:32] <hugo_moss> in either div box
[13:24:59] <hugo_moss> each one could be animating at some time, and i want to disable a handler while they are animating
[13:26:28] <monk3y> Right.  Well toggle() will toggle their display property .. so not sure if you want to hide them completely, or 'fade' them to almost invisible, but just not interactive.
[13:26:44] <hugo_moss> nah i want to keep them animating
[13:26:51] <hugo_moss> and when the animation is over
[13:26:58] <monk3y> Hmm.  Sounds like a trip to jsFiddle or Pastebin for you.
[13:26:59] <hugo_moss> i can click the third div box, its handlers work
[13:27:24] <hugo_moss> i could do it with jquery promises
[13:27:33] <hugo_moss> but i want to know how id do it with .on() or .off()
[13:27:48] <hugo_moss> or all 3
[13:27:52] <monk3y> Promises promises.  You probably could.  I'm gonna quietly alt-tab, Google what that is exactly, then come back and correct myself.
[13:28:28] <SethT> so i ran across some efficiency improvements on diff types of selectors between using .add, or using multi selectors in a string.. what would be the best way to write a "plugin" to jquery so that i can auto manipulate selectors given to jquery ?
[13:28:31] <hugo_moss> it was added in 1.7
[13:28:40] <hugo_moss> jquery is on 1.9 now?
[13:29:06] <hugo_moss> no sorry 1.8.3
[13:29:57] <monk3y> I hear the CIA is using jQuery 2.7.  But they'd denounce it.
[13:30:10] <monk3y> (but yes; 1.8.3 is the hotness on all the CDNs right now, I believe)
[13:33:48] <shoky> .
[13:34:28] <monk3y> Sometimes I think it's netsplits.  Sometimes I think it's me.
[13:36:33] <shoky> frewsxcv94709: hah
[13:37:44] <shoky> frewsxcv94709: you there? i think i found the culprit..
[13:38:11] <shoky> frewsxcv94709:  $(function(albums) { ... }(window.albums));
[13:38:48] <shoky> frewsxcv94709: that's wrong. $(...) expects a function, not a function's return value
[13:39:27] <shoky> frewsxcv94709: so you're running that function before DOM ready, and then giving the return value (undefined) to $(..)
[13:39:40] <shoky> well, donno if that's the cause of the height problem, but it's fishy
[13:42:04] <Drager> If I have a link like this <a href="/page/">Go to page</a> Is it possible to make a scrollTop animation?
[13:42:19] <Drager> I mean to a #
[13:42:48] <shoky> ?scrollTo @ drager
[13:42:50] <bot-t> drager, ScrollTo - jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[13:43:06] <Drager> shoky: Yeah, I know
[13:44:04] <Drager> I have a link on page that will link to another page and I wonder if I can animate on the other page
[13:44:31] <shoky> you can, with the same plugin
[13:44:39] <shoky> on the other page
[13:45:11] <Drager> I don't need the plugin.
[13:45:25] <Drager> To animate a scrolldown
[13:45:48] <shoky> ok, you asked if it's possible.  yes, it is.
[13:46:49] <Drager> So I guess I have to redirect using jquery
[13:47:41] <shoky> jquery isn't into redirecting
[13:48:09] <slavsan> hi all
[13:48:28] <slavsan> I wanted to ask you all if anyone knows if multiple drop can be done with jquery-ui
[13:48:41] <slavsan> I mean multiple drag with multiple drop
[13:49:30] <slavsan> say I have 4 elements (in a group) and want to drop them in a table where they should snap to the grid and every each one of them drop on the appropriate droppable under it

[13:56:14] <frewsxcv94709> Just made a question for it
[13:56:36] <shoky> frewsxcv94709: as a workaround you can try window.innerHeight
[13:56:48] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. still wrestling with this jquery isotope/ infinite scroll issue. I got it pulling in additional posts but for some reason it is not calculating the height of the container appropriately anymore
[13:59:25] <frewsxcv94709> shoky: Yeah, innerHeight works, just curioius why the height() doesn't work
[13:59:48] <shoky> frewsxcv94709: jquery is getting document.documentElement.clientHeight , i'm not sure why
[14:00:54] <shoky> nor why it works fine on the fiddle but not on your site

[14:15:35] <hugo_moss> you mind helping me with my query
[14:16:11] <shoky> hugo_moss: make a jsfiddle
[14:20:01] <LindsayMac> ok now i'm getting this error" Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'masonry'
[14:20:15] <LindsayMac> and since i'm still working on learning baout javascript, my debugging isn't greay
[14:20:24] <shoky> what are you calling it on
[14:20:28] <potato5> @noiseee @potato5 @b-ot thank you so much :D I got it working!
[14:20:34] <potato5> have a great evening
[14:21:06] <potato5> @noiseee that alert code was very helpful :)
[14:24:38] <veQue> hi i have a jquery project i'm working on, it opens on the ipad but shows a 404 eror on iphone.. what gives
[14:24:39] <veQue> ?
[14:25:56] <LindsayMac> shoky:  was that for me?
[14:26:10] <shoky> LindsayMac: yep
[14:26:13] <LindsayMac> veQue:  you gotta give more than that
[14:26:20] <LindsayMac> shoky:  sorry.. i wasnt sure this time ;)
[14:26:48] <LindsayMac> So infinite scroll has a wordpress plugin which is what I am using currently (although I could use the straight JS, supposedly its supposed to work out of the box this way)
[14:26:58] <LindsayMac> shoky:  if you have a look here: http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/blog/
[14:27:30] <LindsayMac> you can see the call back for isotope is there but the error is coming from within the infinite scroll plugin
[14:27:48] <veQue> LindsayMac: fair enough, i was just hoping it was a very common occurance with a common fix
[14:28:07] <veQue> i'm not at liberty to show the link
[14:28:22] <veQue> but.. i will google some more and try you guys again afterwards
[14:28:48] <LindsayMac> veQue:  either set up a test scenario or give a lot more details..
[14:29:22] <shoky> LindsayMac: i think masonry isn't being included..
[14:29:29] <shoky> LindsayMac: it needs to be
[14:29:36] <LindsayMac> hmm ok
[14:29:59] <LindsayMac> I as using the isotope version so maybe I need to include just the straight up masonry download
[14:30:21] <LindsayMac> I mean, obviously it's working because the posts are being blocked like you would with masonry
[14:30:43] <shoky> isotope-masonry is not masonry, i think..
[14:31:18] <shoky> it's just isotope, in a mode that resembles masonry
[14:31:47] <LindsayMac> really?? i didnt think so.. but in the plugin settings it says "isotope/masonry" mode
[14:32:18] <shoky> which plugin?
[14:32:37] <LindsayMac> the infinite scroll plugin I am using for WP..
[14:32:58] <LindsayMac> as I said earlier.. i am using a WP "plugin" for infiniate scroll.. i COULD call in manually but tried this first
[14:33:31] <shoky> well if you look at: http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/wp-content/plugins/infinite-scroll/behaviors/masonry-isotope.js?ver=2.6.1
[14:33:37] <LindsayMac> shoky:  I included masonry in the header just to see what happens.. I am getting different errors now
[14:33:40] <shoky> which is that masonry-isotope behaviour that is included..
[14:33:48] <shoky> it calls $(this).masonry(...)
[14:33:53] <shoky> which fails if masonry is not included
[14:34:05] <shoky> no idea about WP plugins :S
[14:34:13] <LindsayMac> yea.. So i included masonry and now I get cannot call methods on masonry prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'appended'
[14:34:45] <LindsayMac> yea you don't need to really know about the WP plugin.. that part is really only to get the posts from the WP pagination.. which it is successfully doing. Its the javascript that is breaking.  Which is why I figured someone here can help
[14:35:58] <LindsayMac> it's strange.. even if i remove isotope/ masonry mode I get this error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (
[14:38:33] <hugo_moss> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/c22Zn/7/
[14:39:06] <hugo_moss> and:
[14:39:09] <LindsayMac> shoky:  i just turned on debug ==true if that helps
[14:40:14] <hugo_moss> my question is, how can i turn "my_butt" off/on, when both ul_one and ul_two, are not animating at all, or if their animation is done
[14:40:46] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: You can using the :animating selector... at least I thnk that's a thing.
[14:40:54] <hugo_moss> turn my_butt off, if ul_one or ul_two off, if animating
[14:41:01] <hugo_moss> and vice verssa
[14:41:04] <BillCriswell> It's just :animated
[14:41:12] <hugo_moss> really
[14:41:14] <hugo_moss> thanks bill
[14:41:17] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: Welcome.
[14:41:27] <LindsayMac> blah got it!
[14:41:36] <LindsayMac> umm.. kinda
[14:41:39] <LindsayMac> still getting errors
[14:42:55] <hugo_moss> bill, so how would i use that, if i want to turn one div handler .off(), if the other two are animating?
[14:43:29] <hugo_moss> hmm
[14:43:58] <shoky> LindsayMac:  http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/wp-content/plugins/infinite-scroll/behaviors/masonry-isotope.js?ver=2.6.1
[14:44:08] <LindsayMac> I get this error even though its working  $container is not defined
[14:44:15] <shoky> LindsayMac:  in that file, try changing  $(this).masonry('appended', $(newElements));   to    $(this).isotope('appended', $(newElements));
[14:44:33] <LindsayMac> ahh ok
[14:44:40] <shoky> no idea if that will work ;]
[14:44:53] <LindsayMac> it makes sense that it will.. since it SHOULD use isotope instead o fmasonry
[14:45:44] <tankblergh> hi guys! I have a problem with Jquery ui dialog. The dialog has a basic shadow around the box. In the dialog itself, I have a table with a number of rows. When I click a row it will be removed, and the box will resize automatically. This causes the shadow effect to remain in the original size. I want to re-render the box you could say. How do I do this?
[14:45:51] <LindsayMac> BAM! IT WORKED shoky yessss
[14:45:57] <awc737> my CMS practically required bootstrap, things are so embeded it's ugly, and I don't want to touch the core
[14:45:57] <tankblergh> btw, the problem is for IE only
[14:46:04] <awc737> I am getting the error:¬†Object [object Object] has no method 'tooltip'
[14:46:11] <BillCriswell> hugo_moss: You can use :animated and check the length of the elements it's selectin then do what you need based on that.
[14:46:12] <shoky> LindsayMac: yay
[14:46:18] <awc737> how can I add my own tooltip method, so that this error will go away?
[14:46:22] <LindsayMac> shoky:  OMG thank you SOO much!
[14:46:29] <shoky> yw ;]
[14:46:34] <LindsayMac> this website is a present to my husband and I was HOPING i could get it done by XMAS but this was in my way
[14:46:34] <LindsayMac> lol
[14:46:40] <shoky> lol
[14:46:42] <hugo_moss> o ya
[14:46:48] <hugo_moss> thanks billy
[14:47:07] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[14:47:10] <LindsayMac> hahyea.. i know. Kinda sad, but I think he will be PSYCHED on it
[14:47:17] <LindsayMac> because his current site is embarassing now
[14:47:35] <awc737> my CMS requires bootstrap and I don't want to touch the core, but I'm disabling bootstrap.¬†I am getting the error: Object [object Object] has no method 'tooltip'.¬†how can I add my own tooltip method, so that this error will go away?
[14:48:00] <monk3y> Heheh, I don't think that's the solution.
[14:48:21] <BillCriswell> awc737: $.fn.tooltip = function(){ return false }; maybe?
[14:48:23] <LindsayMac> awc737: you can add your own in a script.. what CMS are you using?
[14:48:27] <BillCriswell> Unless you want to make your own maybe.
[14:48:36] <awc737> something like that would be perfect BillCriswell. I'm using Joomla 3
[14:48:48] <LindsayMac> Oh ew.. do you have a choice NOT to use that?
[14:49:18] <awc737> not use what
[14:49:25] <LindsayMac> Joomla
[14:49:37] <awc737> lol. do you use lolpress?
[14:49:52] <LindsayMac> I've used them all.. but Joomla has been the worst
[14:50:15] <awc737> it's pretty irrelevant, but yeah I do have a choice and also used them all and J is the most flexible, and MVC oriented
[14:50:33] <LindsayMac> ohh kay
[14:50:50] <awc737> I like that they changed mootools to jquery finally, but they've embedded Bootstrap pretty hardcore and I'm using Foundation Zurb (trying to)
[14:51:27] <LindsayMac> then why not make your own tooltip?
[14:51:41] <LindsayMac> if you're going to NOT use the given ones that are apparently forced on you.. then override them
[14:52:06] <LindsayMac> I dont understand why a core of a CMS would force a framework library like that.. it seems like a theme thing.. no?
[14:52:08] <awc737> I just use Foundation Zurb's .has-tip and title=, it's very easy
[14:52:16] <awc737> no, it's a cms library
[14:52:48] <LindsayMac> Twitter Bootstrap isn't a CMS library.. its a front end design tool/library. I dont understand what you mean
[14:53:03] <awc737> bootstrap.php is a Joomla library
[14:53:06] <LindsayMac> Ora re you just agreeing that yes, this is not a theme thing and it's forced via the core
[14:53:10] <LindsayMac> ok
[14:53:20] <LindsayMac> but that is what I dont understand.. why they would force that kind of thing..
[14:53:38] <awc737> they are doing annoying things like injecting¬†jQuery(document).ready(function() {jQuery('.hasTooltip').tooltip({});}); into my head
[14:54:00] <LindsayMac> well thats not good. .. YOu should see a doctor for that
[14:54:37] <LindsayMac> curious.. why do you prefer Foundatyion over Twitterboostrap
[14:58:36] <hugo_moss> wow billy, it really works
[14:58:41] <hugo_moss> thank you
[14:58:46] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[14:58:51] <hugo_moss> i will from now on, not hesitate to post jsfiddles
[14:59:26] <BillCriswell> Yeah, having code in front of someone helps. There's just so much other shit that can be wrong.
[14:59:40] <hugo_moss> yea
[15:01:08] <BillCriswell> Later dudes.
[15:09:18] <monk3y> We should call this channel #leavingAndJoiningAndEveryNowAndThenJQuery
[15:11:46] <sol> thats IRC for you
[15:11:50] <sol> maybe disable your joins/leaves
[15:12:01] <LindsayMac> it's a mass exodus ;)
[15:12:08] <LindsayMac> a sign of the apocalypse
[15:12:44] <sol> what is odd, is that it seems that any time I look at any channel, there are more parts than joins
[15:12:57] <ryanneufeld> monk3y: this is a pretty popular channel, I've done what sol suggested and turned that stuff off
[15:13:01] <sol> there must be a time of day I'm not awake where people are mostly joining
[15:13:21] <coldhead> i wonder if IRC parts could be used as an energy source
[15:13:40] <coldhead> it would certainly be sustainable
[15:14:33] <ktom49> does the jQuery .html() method destroy DOM elements inside the html element you're using it on?
[15:14:35] <monk3y> coldhead: vlol (virtual laugh out loud .. it's the thought that counts)
[15:14:58] <monk3y> ktom49: I'd assume so; you're replacing all the html inside the element.
[15:15:10] <ktom49> yeah, that seems to be what's happening
[15:15:37] <ktom49> I have some jQuery being attached to some elements when the page loads, but I have an AJAX call that replaces the stuff inside that div
[15:15:44] <ktom49> so the jQuery isn't being reattached
[15:16:09] <coldhead> you may want to use event delegation with on()
[15:16:11] <coldhead> ?on
[15:16:12] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:16:12] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised ‚Äúon()‚Äù.
[15:16:13] <bot-t> b-ot, Couldn't find "memorised ‚Äúon()‚Äù." in jQuery Docs.
[15:16:27] <coldhead> that will work even with newly added elements
[15:16:45] <coldhead> alternatively this might be a time to use ?detach
[15:16:46] <bot-t> .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[15:16:56] <coldhead> which is more preservey
[15:16:58] <ktom49> hmm
[15:17:02] <williamherry> is jquery support event pass to other, I want when one element be clicked, the effect is other one be clicked, how to pass the click to other element?
[15:17:25] <shoky> williamherry: $('#otherElement').click()
[15:17:47] <coldhead> $('#a').click(function (){ $('#b').trigger('click'); });
[15:17:59] <williamherry> shoky: coldhead thanks
[15:18:17] <sinusss> when was .on() added on jquery? what version?
[15:18:25] <shoky> 1.7
[15:19:06] <coldhead> you can use ?live // if you're on an old timey jQuery
[15:19:06] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:19:46] <shoky> isn't .click() supposed to call the native .click()
[15:20:18] <sinusss> shoky thanks!
[15:20:54] <shoky> hm i guess not.
[15:21:25] <sinusss> yup, just replaced my on() to live()
[15:21:33] <shoky> no, don't do that
[15:21:41] <shoky> live() is deprecated
[15:21:58] <shoky> on() is the way to go. there is a way to make it work like live() if you need it
[15:22:02] <coldhead> it's not deprecated in old versions
[15:22:08] <coldhead> it used to be the bleeding edge
[15:22:11] <coldhead> those were the days
[15:22:19] <shoky> if its deprecated now
[15:22:21] <coldhead> i felt so a live()
[15:22:29] <shoky> it's deprecated because it's a bad method
[15:22:33] <shoky> it was just as bad before 1.7
[15:22:39] <shoky> should use .delegate before 1.7
[15:22:42] <shoky> for delegation
[15:22:43] <coldhead> blah blah blah
[15:22:53] <coldhead> if it solves your problem it's a good method
[15:22:54] <shoky> no, .live() is evil
[15:22:56] <shoky> no it's not
[15:23:29] <shoky> i'm not petty with these things usually.. but live specifically is evil :S
[15:23:41] <coldhead> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy
[15:23:47] <shoky> $('button').live(...)   doesnt do a shit to 'button'
[15:23:55] <coldhead> child molesters are more evil than live()
[15:24:02] <coldhead> have some perspective
[15:24:08] <shoky> some of them, coldhead, some of them.
[15:25:03] <shoky> this channel is about doing the right thing, don't see why you need to 'blah blah blah' me
[15:25:05] <shoky> ;p
[15:25:21] <coldhead> if someone is using a modern jquery then yes, eschew live()
[15:25:35] <shoky> and if they're not, then tell em to .delegate
[15:25:37] <coldhead> but if someone is in a pre-on #jQUery and just wants to make a thing work
[15:25:39] <shoky> what's the difference
[15:25:42] <coldhead> and not have a history lesson
[15:25:47] <coldhead> and not understand delegate
[15:25:49] <shoky> just cause now it's declared as "deprecated"
[15:25:50] <shoky> ?
[15:25:55] <shoky> why should that matter
[15:25:56] <coldhead> if they just want to wind up and go have a brewski
[15:25:59] <coldhead> and live() works
[15:26:04] <shoky> it still does
[15:26:05] <coldhead> then live suffices
[15:26:06] <shoky> in 1.8
[15:26:22] <coldhead> shoky, you're young and idealistic, and i cherish that about you
[15:26:30] <shoky> man i'm 30 in a week :(
[15:26:34] <coldhead> but when you reach my age you sometimes just want to get on with things
[15:26:44] <coldhead> and head to your cold cold grave
[15:26:50] <coldhead> by a more direct root
[15:26:52] <coldhead> route**
[15:27:04] <shoky> sure, do that.. but why not give good advice while you're dying
[15:27:42] <coldhead> because yu can't teach those unwilling to learn
[15:27:53] <coldhead> contrast "how do i get this to work" vs "what is the best way"
[15:28:01] <coldhead> the great is the enemy of the good
[15:28:17] <shoky> i didnt get the feeling that he was unwilling to learn
[15:28:34] <coldhead> i always assume such unwillingness until i learn otherwise
[15:28:55] <shoky> yer full of shit ;p
[15:30:20] <ClearsTheScreen> or just long enough in these kind of channels to see that in the majority of cases it's a good default ;p
[15:31:07] <shoky> i've been here long enough myself ;p
[15:32:01] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: you're old an bitter, and some day you'll die.
[15:32:30] <ryanneufeld> but you're right
[15:32:51] <ryanneufeld> sometimes people don't want to learn
[15:32:53] <YammYcoding> hi! I want an script to reload page like if with shift+F5 . I put document.location = document.location, but it didn't work like that. Can be done somehow?
[15:32:55] <LindsayMac> can you guys just code something for me.. I can't learn this stuff.. thx plzzzzzz
[15:32:57] <ryanneufeld> and shoky you don't have to help them :p
[15:33:10] <sol> LindsayMac; sure, $50/hr
[15:33:13] <shoky> im all for that.. not teaching unwilling people
[15:33:21] <ryanneufeld> YammYcoding: yes, Press shift+F5
[15:33:23] <LindsayMac> sol:  i was joking
[15:33:26] <shoky> but i dont assume unwillingness to begin with
[15:33:27] <YammYcoding> meh
[15:33:29] <sol> LindsayMac; I know :D
[15:33:37] <ryanneufeld> sol sells hims self cheap
[15:33:38] <LindsayMac> k.. haha just making sure
[15:33:39] <YammYcoding> but can javascript refresh page like this?
[15:33:44] <ryanneufeld> I wouldn't do it for less than 80
[15:33:49] <ryanneufeld> YammYcoding: no
[15:33:55] <sol> ryanneufeld; no I don't, I just triple my hours when I invoice
[15:34:00] <sol> :D
[15:34:04] <YammYcoding> damit
[15:34:21] <ryanneufeld> sol: yeah, but if you *spent* the hours at my rates...
[15:34:22] <sol> while simultaneously beating you out for the contract, seeing as how my rates are so much lower.
[15:34:36] <monk3y> sol: I am one of your clients.  PM me.  NOW.
[15:34:41] <sol> OH SHIT
[15:34:44] <monk3y> j/k
[15:34:45] <monk3y> heheh
[15:34:50] <ryanneufeld> LOL
[15:34:52] <ryanneufeld> BUSTED
[15:34:54] <sol> lol
[15:35:02] <sol> uhhh, I was jk too.
[15:35:15] <ryanneufeld> somebody gonna get hurt
[15:35:18] <LindsayMac> ahh i'm still getting this error and while it's not really effecting things, its dreiving me nuts
[15:35:28] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: what error?
[15:35:47] <sol> is the hobbit out now?  how about now?  now?
[15:35:51] <tankblergh> anyone know how I can make the jquery dialog overlay size match the size of the div content in IE? when resize the content, the overlay is lagging until i change focus
[15:35:58] <LindsayMac> http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/blog/ <~~ on there, when you scroll down (even if your monitor is big you can try to sceoll down and it will low more) i get an error that $newElms is not defined
[15:35:59] <tankblergh> i need a rerendering or something
[15:36:10] <veQue> ok i got it load on iphone
[15:36:20] <tankblergh> so the shadow from the dialog is ghosting
[15:36:37] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: odd, if your browser is big enough, it doesn't actually trigger
[15:36:37] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  I am currently working on making the filtering tools work up top.. The secondary menu with the "SHOW ALL" currently filters but doesnt animate.. still working on that part
[15:36:55] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  are you using chrome?
[15:36:59] <ryanneufeld> yup
[15:37:02] <LindsayMac> because it does there if you snap the browser to show the background
[15:37:31] <ryanneufeld> ah, I'm a maximizer
[15:37:33] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  if you scroll down enough so that the linen texture shows it should work.. if not, you can shrink the browser
[15:37:36] <LindsayMac> AHH ok
[15:37:55] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  i just haven't loaded in enough posts so I set it that way for now
[15:38:07] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: can you dev with the un-minified JS
[15:38:32] <LindsayMac> yea.. sorry
[15:38:32] <ryanneufeld> you'd be able to see where the error is coming from. it might not be your fault, it could be a bug in the lib you're using
[15:38:50] <shoky> LindsayMac: in the infinite-scroll config, did you set up that callback?
[15:38:56] <LindsayMac> shoky:  yea
[15:39:27] <anew> i'm using $("#footer").append( script ); to append a script on the page - the script runs, however it doesnt appear in dom ?
[15:39:38] <shoky> LindsayMac: the error is coming from there. $container.isotope('appended', $newElems )
[15:39:55] <shoky> LindsayMac: the append is already happening in that external js file we edited earlier
[15:40:05] <shoky> LindsayMac: so i dont think this callback is needed .. not sure tho
[15:40:07] <LindsayMac> ahh so i dont need the callback
[15:40:29] <LindsayMac> boy the docs for this plugin are all screwy if thats the case
[15:40:45] <LindsayMac> yippe.. thats it
[15:40:55] <shoky> i think you tried to use it in 2 different ways, simultaneously :P
[15:41:38] <LindsayMac> yea... but that is because I was following the instructions in the readme and their site instead of using my common sense.
[15:41:55] <ryanneufeld> also, I would try to avoid using eval if you can
[15:41:59] <jtm> LindsayMac Congrats on getting it fixed! I must now work on my infinite scrolling :)
[15:42:11] <ryanneufeld> but I don't know what that script is doing, so I could be full of shit
[15:42:14] <LindsayMac> jtm:  good luck! the infinite scrolling pluginf or WP is a PITA
[15:42:25] <YammYcoding> question: document.location = document.location does not reload the page at all?
[15:42:27] <jtm> LindsayMac I'm doing this from scratch :)
[15:42:30] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld: where do you see the eval?
[15:42:38] <shoky> it's just eval'ing that callback (that is a string)
[15:42:38] <ryanneufeld> was in your callback
[15:42:40] <jtm> LindsayMac Well revising the one I worked on before, ugh
[15:42:48] <ryanneufeld> that you removed because you didn't need it
[15:43:05] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  no it wasnt.. my callback was just one little line of code..
[15:43:36] <shoky> LindsayMac: he means this- jQuery( infinite_scroll.contentSelector ).infinitescroll( infinite_scroll, function(newElements, data) { eval(infinite_scroll.callback); });
[15:43:39] <ryanneufeld> jQuery( infinite_scroll.contentSelector ).infinitescroll( infinite_scroll, function(newElements, data) { eval(infinite_scroll.callback); });
[15:43:39] <shoky> that eval
[15:43:41] <LindsayMac> Hmm so I just need to figure out why its not animating and i'll be all set! Yay.. ym husband might actually get this in time for XMAS
[15:43:42] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:43:42] <ryanneufeld> that
[15:43:47] <shoky> sry ;p
[15:44:23] <LindsayMac> That is likely code from the plugin dev..
[15:44:36] <LindsayMac> i might strip it all out and just use his code to pull in the paginated WP stuff and do the rest over..
[15:48:02] <LindsayMac> ugh this is so weird.. No errors, yet not animating
[15:48:36] <LindsayMac> well the CSS transitions are happening, but not the javascript fall back ones..
[15:48:51] <LindsayMac> hmm i wonder if it wont use the js fallback ones based on browser instead of actual existence of it
[15:48:56] <LindsayMac> sorry.. just thinking out loud
[15:50:57] <shoky> LindsayMac: what's supposed to be animating?
[15:51:28] <LindsayMac> shoky:  when you filter via a link on the sub nav (anything after the "Show All" link) it should shuffle around and look all pretty and slick.. ha
[15:51:55] <LindsayMac> but i included the CSS transoitions and it worked, but it SHOULD have a fall back for without the CSS3 transitions.. but I suppose it could be calling those based on browser
[15:52:26] <shoky> ok well. yep it works ;p
[15:52:51] <LindsayMac> yea. i was hoping it would fallback to the JS without it but I guess it doesnt. I dont have my older computer to test with
[15:52:54] <LindsayMac> its all good.
[15:52:59] <LindsayMac> weeeee this is fun
[15:54:46] <shoky> LindsayMac: animations are working on IE9
[15:54:57] <LindsayMac> shoky:  ohh thanks for testing..
[15:55:12] <LindsayMac> but doesn't IE9 use CSS3 animation? I'm looking to test in a browser that wont support CSS3
[15:55:35] <shoky> IE9 doesnt
[15:55:41] <shoky> http://caniuse.com/css-transitions
[15:55:53] <shoky> and it works on IE9 that's in IE8 mode
[15:55:58] <LindsayMac> really?? wow i had no idea . but thats good news
[15:56:09] <LindsayMac> i dont know why i thought IE9 had css transitions

[16:08:30] <ogk1000__> whats the best way to disable hash tag calling the anchor on page load? I want to make it so IF hash THEN find the link and scroll to it (vs it always just jumps right to it)
[16:08:46] <ogk1000__> the only issue I need help with is disablign the default hash listener in the best way, any feedback would be great thx
[16:10:44] <coldhead> see shoky? "best way" ^^
[16:10:46] <jtm> How could I traverse through a html backwards? Like with .each?
[16:13:04] <coldhead> this seems to work, jtm http://jsfiddle.net/wd6UC/
[16:13:28] <jtm> Is there a way to do it in O(1)?
[16:13:53] <sheilablackrose> hi guys i have a table with dynamic rows that is called from another model. can you point me in  a way if i want to create a floatable panel with checkbox n drop down list that will always appear atthe bottom of the page
[16:14:13] <coldhead> i doubt it
[16:14:40] <jtm> Even getting the last node?
[16:15:19] <jtm> Actually this won't be too bad in O(n) since n isn't growing.
[16:15:37] <jtm> My concern was a 10,000 list and doing that reverse.
[16:15:53] <jtm> Or 100,000
[16:16:04] <jtm> But I will be doing it on the last ajax call in, which is always 50.
[16:16:46] <LindsayMac> hmm.. added some more content and now it's not calculating the height correctly http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/blog/
[16:17:30] <coldhead> jtm http://jsfiddle.net/wd6UC/1/
[16:17:58] <jtm> coldhead That's a smarter way :)
[16:18:30] <LindsayMac> ugh there is a LOT more to this that i am realizing isn't working appropriately now..
[16:18:51] <coldhead> jtm: you might find a better way if you dig into the jQuery internals
[16:18:59] <jtm> I think using lastNode or something
[16:19:01] <coldhead> jQuery tries to preserve document order
[16:19:04] <sol> LindsayMac; welcome to the state of ALL software in existence.
[16:19:15] <coldhead> you might be able to create a hcea() function that goes backwards
[16:19:20] <sol> except maybe the unix commands
[16:19:22] <LindsayMac> when using something like a lazy load or infinite scroll and isotope, when you filter, shouldn't it filter ALL Of the content? Isn't that the purpose of using something like lazy load instead of simply paginating?
[16:19:25] <jtm> http://api.jquery.com/last/
[16:19:37] <jtm> I don't need to actually traverse backwards
[16:19:42] <jtm> Just get the last matching element.
[16:21:14] <coldhead> $li[$li.length - 1]
[16:21:29] <coldhead> or $li.filter(':last')
[16:21:30] <LindsayMac> I am guessing i might need some type of callback to look through ALL posts ?
[16:21:38] <LindsayMac> ugh.. logically in my brain i dont know how this would work..
[16:21:49] <jtm> coldhead I'm guessing the first one is faster?
[16:22:15] <coldhead> yes but the return different things
[16:22:37] <coldhead> [index] returns the DOM element
[16:22:38] <coldhead> filter returns a jquery object around that element
[16:22:55] <jtm> I probably want the :last then
[16:23:04] <jtm> Since I'll need to be able to easily grab some attributes.
[16:23:26] <coldhead> ?last
[16:23:26] <bot-t> .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[16:23:32] <coldhead> oh look you don't even need filter
[16:23:35] <coldhead> $li.last()
[16:23:38] <coldhead> thanks jQUery
[16:23:39] <jtm> yeah you can do .last
[16:23:50] <coldhead> i bet that's implemented to run quick as hell
[16:24:00] <jtm> I hope so :)
[16:24:13] <jtm> Keep in mind the data set won't be larger than 50
[16:24:17] <jtm> So it should be nearly instant
[16:28:47] <veQue> i cant get keyup or keypress to work on iphone any help?
[16:29:13] <veQue> $('[type="tel"]').bind('keypress', function(){});
[16:29:31] <shoky> coldhead: you forget there are hundreds of people in this channel. even if i tell some dumb stubborn idiot why he shouldnt use .live(), a hundred other people might be reading that and learning
[16:29:58] <shoky> and of those hundred, maybe 1 is not a stubborn idiot and will learn, i mean.
[16:29:59] <veQue> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pda3ZcsY2pM coding music if you are from my generation
[16:30:03] <coldhead> you're right shoky, i should bite my tongue
[16:30:34] <coldhead> i work with people who use a doctype from the late 90s and will ever ever let go of live()
[16:30:37] <LindsayMac> So can anyone help me work through how the logic would go to use the isotope filtering across ALL posts, not just those that are pulled in via infinite scroll??
[16:30:42] <pinholecamera> hey folks, i was wondering‚Ä¶ is there a way to setup a listener to execute some function if say, a div changes it's width?
[16:30:44] <shoky> coldhead: i work with much worse, so?
[16:30:45] <coldhead> it's made me too pragmatic
[16:31:00] <shoky> this channel is one way to get away from that
[16:31:06] <coldhead> ?ba resize plugin @ pinholecamera
[16:31:07] <veQue> actually let me rephrase
[16:31:11] <bot-t> pinholecamera, jQuery ProgressBar Plugin - jQuery Plugins - We've been looking to provide a higher-quality, spam-free experience at the plugins site for some time, and a major error on our part forced us to shut down the current site before we could put the... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jQueryProgressBar
[16:31:18] <coldhead> that's not the one you stupid bot-t
[16:31:24] <pinholecamera> haha
[16:31:25] <pinholecamera> well
[16:31:29] <tw2113> yeah you stupid bot!
[16:31:29] <pinholecamera> i should rephrase that
[16:31:34] <coldhead> pinholecamera: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[16:31:35] <pinholecamera> is there a way to do it without a plugin?
[16:31:36] <veQue> i have a onscreen numbpad that pops on my iphone screen... but i cant type with it
[16:31:46] <coldhead> the plugin is about 10 lines of code
[16:31:46] <veQue> i hit the buttons and nothing changes
[16:31:54] <pinholecamera> coldhead: okay, i can handle that
[16:32:05] <coldhead> damn straight you can
[16:33:48] <LindsayMac> CRAP~ it says not to use infinite scroll with filtering.. hmmm
[16:34:07] <LindsayMac> so how can I pull every blog post ever written in to a single page without killing browser load time
[16:34:23] <MistuhKurtz> LindsayMac, lazy loading
[16:34:54] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz: is lazy loading the same thing as infinite scroll?? Does it actually load the HTML elements to the DOM without loading the content so things can be applied to them?
[16:35:19] <shoky> there's a limit where too many DOM elements kill the browser, period..
[16:35:39] <MistuhKurtz> uh an 'infinite scroll' would implement lazy loading, yes.
[16:35:41] <shoky> its not very high sadly
[16:35:53] <LindsayMac> shoky:  true.. but I can pull in the last 100 or so blog posts so that when people filter at least they are getting something more than just whgatever is set
[16:36:01] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  HUH????
[16:36:08] <MistuhKurtz> WAT
[16:36:13] <MistuhKurtz> don't yell at me :(
[16:36:35] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  what do you mean?? that made very little sense.. an "infinite scroll would implement lazy loading"...?
[16:36:42] <LindsayMac> those are two different scripts/plugins
[16:37:03] <LindsayMac> shoky:  so do you have any suggestions on how I should best tackle this? How abotu something like InView?
[16:37:05] <MistuhKurtz> I don't know if infinite scroll is a plugin or your description of the effect
[16:37:20] <MistuhKurtz> lazy loading is the more technical term for the concept of loading resources only on-demand, rather than all up front
[16:37:21] <shoky> LindsayMac: no idea, i really dont know the infinte scroll plugin and its capabilites
[16:37:25] <MistuhKurtz> it's a performance enhancement technique
[16:37:26] <ogk1000> sup coldhead / shoky
[16:37:34] <MistuhKurtz> I don't know anything about the infinite scroll plugin
[16:37:40] <shoky> lazy loading is one important capability, but if you have so many elements,
[16:37:43] <LindsayMac> shoky:  well i am scrapping infinite scroll because I cant filter with it.. so i'm looking for others
[16:37:50] <lenswipee> MistuhKurtz: LindsayMac is a Troll.
[16:37:53] <shoky> you also need a solution that removes DOM elements that are not actually in view
[16:37:53] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[16:38:02] <shoky> and loads them back as needed
[16:38:18] <LindsayMac> shoky:  you mean remove them that are not in view after first loading them? I dont understand.
[16:38:23] <MistuhKurtz> shoky, LindsayMac, I would like to see an example where lazy loading adds too many elements to the DOM and slows down the browser
[16:38:23] <shoky> but i've no idea if you're at that limit, and if the stuff you're using do any of that
[16:38:41] <LindsayMac> Hmm.. I'm just trying to work out the logic here.
[16:38:50] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  I dont think you're understanding my use case here.
[16:38:59] <shoky> LindsayMac that's what i meant yeah
[16:39:10] <MistuhKurtz> my only encounters with lazy loading are that I keep on reading news sites forever until I become frustrated and quit without any closure
[16:39:12] <LindsayMac> shoky:  ok...
[16:39:19] <MistuhKurtz> and they never slowed down, and I kept going pretty far
[16:39:28] <shoky> MistuhKurtz:  lazy loading is great but at some point you've loaded too much maybe..
[16:39:41] <MistuhKurtz> well I'm wondering what 'too much' is
[16:39:47] <shoky> i'll make you a fiddle..
[16:40:02] <shoky> it wont have any lazy loading.. the assumption is that it's already been loaded ;p
[16:40:07] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz: im not too concerned about interaction.. I know how it will work out in this case for the user.. I am most concerned about making sure the filtering options work for ALL blog posts instead of ust the ones loaded by infinite scroll
[16:40:34] <MistuhKurtz> I don't know what you're going on about LindsayMac
[16:40:37] <MistuhKurtz> what do you mean by filtering
[16:40:40] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  those also potentially used something like infinite scroll where it only loads them when you get to them which is different
[16:40:50] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  isotope.. as I said before.
[16:40:57] <MistuhKurtz> huh
[16:41:01] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  forget it.
[16:41:03] <lenswipee> MistuhKurtz: LindsayMac is a Troll.
[16:41:17] <LindsayMac> I am just trying to work out the logic. If you don't understand the use case, thats fine.
[16:41:36] <MistuhKurtz> I only don't understand because you're unable to describe it eloquently
[16:41:49] <MistuhKurtz> or you're assuming I have been reading everything you've said when I only just now came into the conversation
[16:42:05] <MistuhKurtz> describing a filtering function as "isotope" does not compute.
[16:42:08] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  I tried to explain it. You went on a tangent about news websites
[16:42:36] <LindsayMac> Are you not familiar with the isotope plugin? Its a VERY common one which is why I figured you would know what I was saying
[16:42:46] <MistuhKurtz> No I'm not
[16:42:58] <MistuhKurtz> and I had an interest in helping you but that is quickly fading
[16:43:39] <LindsayMac> I am using ISOTOPE which is a plugin for jquery that lays out content in a grid and allows you to filter via data-filter
[16:43:51] <LindsayMac> I am using this to layout blog posts. There are a LOT of them and they are categorized
[16:44:01] <LindsayMac> http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/blog/
[16:44:16] <LindsayMac> Wordpress paginates it so you dont load them all in one shot..
[16:44:38] <LindsayMac> infinite scroll pulls in the content from the pages as if you were never leaving the page (hence the name )
[16:45:19] <MistuhKurtz> I don't think combining the two is wise
[16:45:19] <LindsayMac> The issue is that when you go to the blog page, or instance, and click one of the categories, it only filters the shown blog posts and not all of them... this is because isotope is only filtering what is in front of it because the others aren't loaded yet
[16:45:30] <LindsayMac> well that is what I was saying!!
[16:45:34] <LindsayMac> I realized that this is not going to wokr
[16:45:52] <LindsayMac> So I was trying to work out the logic in how to achieve a similar concept without infinite scroll
[16:46:01] <MistuhKurtz> okay, well drop the infinite scroll requirement
[16:46:10] <LindsayMac> I have dropped it..
[16:46:34] <LindsayMac> I do, however, need to have some type of "thing" in place where not everything is loaded in one shot because there will be lots of blog posts
[16:46:55] <lenswipee> The logic would be to filter first before applying infinite scroll o_0
[16:46:58] <LindsayMac> SO I can either pull in empty DOM elements and then pull the content in as it gets in view...
[16:47:03] <LindsayMac> lenswipee:  no
[16:47:25] <LindsayMac> or pull in everything when a filter is clicked but I don't see how thats possible.
[16:48:59] <lenswipee> no more LindsayMac
[16:49:15] <LindsayMac> lenswipee:  get a life
[16:49:48] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  so you follow?
[16:50:32] <lenswipee> MistuhKurtz: the Troll is all yours. goodluck. I hope you have advill.
[16:50:57] <MistuhKurtz> I'm having trouble envisioning this working correctly..
[16:51:05] <MistuhKurtz> okay
[16:51:14] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  but do you understand the concept?
[16:51:32] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  you're right.. there may not be a way to do it, but thats why i figured if I worked through the logic it would help
[16:51:43] <MistuhKurtz> when a filter is clicked, it needs to make an AJAX request with a new WP_Query to add those items
[16:51:46] <LindsayMac> there could be something I dn't know about because I am new with javascript but know php well
[16:52:12] <MistuhKurtz> the problem is, there's a disconnect between the back-end and front-end: if you've already loaded those same items, you don't want to load them a second time
[16:52:34] <LindsayMac> yea..
[16:52:54] <LindsayMac> Loaded them with PHP, but the front end isn't displaying them all via the wordpress paginate
[16:52:58] <MistuhKurtz> You could clear all the existing items, and load all of the new ones
[16:53:12] <MistuhKurtz> I don't know how that would end up looking when animated though
[16:53:14] <LindsayMac> I dont understand..
[16:53:22] <LindsayMac> Oh i see..
[16:53:22] <MistuhKurtz> I have a feeling it might not be desirable. but it might work.
[16:53:51] <LindsayMac> you mean when you click a filter it removed EVERYTHING and then only displays the actual items you requested?
[16:54:13] <LindsayMac> So something like loading empty DOM elements wouldnt be good because its too many?
[16:54:32] <MistuhKurtz> forget about the empty elements thing, that's the wrong approach
[16:54:39] <LindsayMac> ok.
[16:54:48] <MistuhKurtz> so you're saying you want the filters to all be toggle switches?
[16:55:08] <MistuhKurtz> meaning each one can be turned on or off, independent of the others?
[16:55:29] <LindsayMac> yea they don't need to work together like a drill down approach
[16:55:48] <LindsayMac> But they do need to query ALL of the blog posts so it's a real representation of posts in that category
[16:55:52] <MistuhKurtz> Oh I just thought of something
[16:55:57] <MistuhKurtz> let me read the docs real quick..
[16:56:43] <LindsayMac> k
[16:58:09] <MistuhKurtz> Filter A button clicked -> check if A posts have already been loaded. If they have, then call the Isotope API method to show them. If they haven't, then make an AJAX request to load x number of A posts
[16:58:46] <LindsayMac> So it would animate/filter what is there and THEN get what is not?
[16:59:35] <MistuhKurtz> other way around
[17:00:03] <LindsayMac> hmm why would it be the other way around.. ? Wouldn't you want to filter down first so there aren't all the current posts loaded and then get the rest?
[17:00:06] <MistuhKurtz> if necessary, get posts -> animate to show posts
[17:00:14] <LindsayMac> ah ok..
[17:00:20] <MistuhKurtz> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/adding-items.html
[17:00:23] <LindsayMac> So get them all and add them to the bottom and then filter down
[17:00:27] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  i was just looking at that
[17:00:34] <LindsayMac> i was just thinking the other way around.. filter then add
[17:00:40] <LindsayMac> instead of add then filter via a click
[17:00:55] <MistuhKurtz> on the other side of this, you're going to need to make an AJAX request to WordPress
[17:01:05] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  yea.. I'm sure I can figure that out.
[17:01:19] <LindsayMac> iu've never had issues getting content from WP.. its the front end stuff i struggle with
[17:01:19] <MistuhKurtz> so you'll need to be able to pass parameters in the URL to indicate which category or tag the posts need to come from
[17:01:36] <sheilablackrose>  hi guys i have a table in my css i did .documentTable  { something } than .documentTable .documentRow { something }
[17:01:40] <MistuhKurtz> and then you'll need to program it with a custom WP_Query based on those URL parameters, which will return the necessary posts
[17:01:44] <sheilablackrose> is there a reson why th esecond one gets canceled out
[17:02:31] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  yea ok.. So I just need to figure out how to make that happen with a CLICK on one of the isotope filter buttons..
[17:02:57] <LindsayMac> So write a script to first query and then use the addItems method and only when that is done allow it to filter
[17:02:59] <LindsayMac> ok
[17:03:25] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  so with that method, i SHOULD be able to use infinite scroll (or similar) ..
[17:03:44] <MistuhKurtz> I"m not thinking about infinite scroll for right now.
[17:03:59] <MistuhKurtz> if you can accomplish it without infinite scroll, then you can try adding it
[17:05:04] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  yea i get that..
[17:05:16] <LindsayMac> I don't see why it wouldnt.. but yes
[17:05:25] <LindsayMac> ok.. so now who's gonna code it for me.
[17:05:26] <MistuhKurtz> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/filtering.html
[17:05:26] <LindsayMac> jk
[17:05:38] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  yea i've read that.. its how ive gotten as far as I have
[17:05:41] <MistuhKurtz> in the click handler for the filters, that's where your logic needs to go
[17:05:57] <LindsayMac> Ok yes.. that makes sense
[17:06:47] <MistuhKurtz> the logic to check if the posts need to be loaded or not, i mean.
[17:07:27] <MistuhKurtz> Interesting problem you have there. I'm available for hire to code it if you like :P
[17:07:44] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  something like this https://gist.github.com/4273184
[17:07:48] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  what are your rates?
[17:08:00] <LindsayMac> I'm putting this site together for my husband's Xmas present.. I know, weird
[17:08:04] <MistuhKurtz> ah
[17:08:39] <veQue>  /*-webkit-touch-callout: none;	-webkit-user-select: none;	-khtml-user-select: none;	-moz-user-select: none;	-ms-user-select: none;	user-select: none;*/
[17:08:42] <veQue> i commented it out and now it works
[17:08:45] <veQue> just for future ref
[17:08:54] <veQue> css broke my code
[17:11:33] <coldhead> aw
[17:11:47] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can someone tell me why some class overwrites n doesnt work?
[17:11:53] <sheilablackrose> how can i stop this behaviour
[17:13:37] <monk3y> sheilablackrose: I don't fully understand the issue, got code example(s)?
[17:13:37] <LindsayMac> sheilablackrose:  thats really a CSS issue, but post a link to a working example
[17:14:41] <xenome> i appologize for the simple question, but how exactly do I differentiate two controlgroup sets of buttons (using jquery mobile)?
[17:15:29] <sheilablackrose> Hi lindsaymac. well its kinda straight forward like .documentTable  { something } than .documentTable .documentRow { something }   but like t hefont n color in table row doenst get executed
[17:15:56] <LindsayMac> sheilablackrose:  you need to show something..
[17:16:05] <LindsayMac> and you are using THAN or THEN?
[17:16:30] <sheilablackrose> then
[17:16:36] <sheilablackrose> no
[17:16:39] <sheilablackrose> i mean its nt in th ecode
[17:17:22] <LindsayMac> sheilablackrose:  it is in the code.. you did something wrong..
[17:17:30] <sheilablackrose> <table class=".documenttable"><tr class="documentRow"></tr></table>
[17:17:52] <LindsayMac> sheilablackrose:  no.. the style sheet has something overriding it
[17:18:03] <LindsayMac> this isnt even a jquery issue TBH
[17:19:49] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/VgHeZ/
[17:20:00] <veQue> i cant seem to get swipeleft to work on iphone, but it works on ipad
[17:20:52] <d3m0n> Hey guys, Im trying to attache a click function to a jQuery UI slider to add/subtract values by a set incriment. I am having trouble attaching it to the specific slider (since I have multiple sliders) Im trying to use something like .prev() or .siblings() since the click function is a sibling of the slider in a div element but from what I am reading it seems those two functions will only run inside my add/subtract div.
[17:21:03] <d3m0n> How would I select a specific element within the same parent element as my slider?
[17:24:14] <sheilablackrose> basically most my css gets overwritten n doesnt get executed when i use firebug n change the properties nothing changes
[17:26:06] <LindsayMac> sheilablackrose:  its not ... the red is showing on top of the black becuase they are the same size
[17:26:32] <sheilablackrose> but even when i disable the black nothing shows
[17:26:35] <sheilablackrose> the alignment doesnt work
[17:26:41] <sheilablackrose> the font size doesnt change
[17:27:00] <LindsayMac> sheilablackrose:  if you remove the red, there is a black border.. that means both are being used
[17:27:01] <sheilablackrose> is there a way to tell css to use this class only n dont inherit
[17:27:15] <LindsayMac> sheilablackrose:  !Importrant
[17:27:18] <sheilablackrose> i think its in my project something its overwritting
[17:27:28] <sheilablackrose> how do i do that
[17:28:31] <LindsayMac> omg sheilablackrose .. you don't even have a class called .documentRow so of course its not going to display in your HTML
[17:28:45] <LindsayMac> sheilablackrose:  you have no element in your html with the class documentRow
[17:28:56] <sheilablackrose> oh i have it i didnt paste the hwole thing
[17:29:00] <sheilablackrose> its a huge site
[17:29:18] <sheilablackrose> i can see from firebug that there are css that work on any table
[17:29:24] <sheilablackrose> so its probably overwrting mine
[17:29:33] <sheilablackrose> is there away i can tell css to use mine ?
[17:30:13] <sol> I love how each language likes to mess with you a little
[17:30:19] <sol> it should be !Unimportant :)
[17:30:32] <d3m0n> sheilablackrose: This is a case for #css but just from taking a peak you got <tbody class="documentHeaderRow"> which overwrites ur <table class="docuemtTable"> border
[17:30:33] <LindsayMac> sheilablackrose:  OMG.. i am no longer helping
[17:30:55] <LindsayMac> d3m0n:  thats not hte class she's talking about.. she's talking about .documentRow i think
[17:31:09] <sheilablackrose> no i think i confused you guys
[17:31:23] <sheilablackrose> basically i write my classes in that style
[17:31:38] <sheilablackrose> but when i use it in my site other stuff get over writte
[17:31:58] <d3m0n> So that just means you have conflicting CSS
[17:32:13] <d3m0n> Again a case for #css =P
[17:32:15] <LindsayMac> sheilablackrose:  no. you just need to show an example
[17:32:25] <sheilablackrose> yeah so i found something lik ethis in one of the css tr.parent td {
[17:32:25] <sheilablackrose>     color: #00B6D4;
[17:32:25] <sheilablackrose> }
[17:32:36] <sheilablackrose> so this is overwriting what i right i guess
[17:32:48] <sheilablackrose> but since its a huge project i cant remove their css
[17:32:59] <d3m0n> It would overwrite any td that has a tr with the class of .parent
[17:33:16] <sheilablackrose> is there away i can tell this table like <table class=""ignore all others n use .mine>
[17:33:19] <sheilablackrose> something lik ethat
[17:33:27] <d3m0n> No but you can overwrite their CSS
[17:33:37] <sheilablackrose> how
[17:33:43] <LindsayMac> !important
[17:33:46] <veQue> .innerWidth() gives me the width of an element.. how do i get this number everytime the element changes?
[17:33:54] <d3m0n> so td.parent td { color: #blue; }
[17:34:00] <sheilablackrose> oh that was a command i thought u telling me to listen up something important
[17:34:05] <d3m0n> Remember "cascading style sheet"
[17:34:05] <monk3y> hahah
[17:34:08] <veQue> changes width that is
[17:34:24] <d3m0n> !important is bad practice imo
[17:34:24] <b-ot> d3m0n, memorised ‚Äúimportant‚Äù.
[17:34:31] <d3m0n> lol whoops
[17:34:37] <monk3y> ?.resize()
[17:34:38] <sheilablackrose> so it will be <table class="!important mycss">

[17:35:16] <sheilablackrose> im listening to both n trying to understand
[17:35:17] <d3m0n> No need for important if ur looking to overwrite it
[17:35:20] <sheilablackrose> im still new
[17:36:02] <veQue> thanks
[17:36:22] <sheilablackrose> thanks guys
[17:57:44] <b0ss_> about the FullCalendar and JSON... I want to a new event... how to do it programatically ?
[18:24:04] <wroathe> I've got model.save() being called one time in my small application. In fact, the method that calls it only gets called on blur of a specific input. Why does model.validate get called twice for every one .save?
[18:24:27] <wroathe> The arguments to both calls look identical... The first being attributes and the second being options
[18:24:33] <wroathe> whoops, wrong channel
[18:24:35] <acidjazz> how do i horizontally scroll something in jquery
[18:25:55] <kborchers> acidjazz: you can animate the element's scrollLeft
[18:26:19] <acidjazz> kborchers: i just pass it a value?
[18:26:30] <acidjazz> i guess negative to go right?
[18:27:25] <kborchers> no positive something like $("element").animate({scrollLeft:100}, 1000);
[18:27:55] <acidjazz> scrollbar isnt movin
[18:27:56] <acidjazz> hmm
[18:28:05] <kborchers> fiddle?
[18:28:20] <acidjazz> hmm id have to write a scenario
[18:28:25] <acidjazz> ok esc
[18:30:53] <d3m0n> What would be the function to find the parent of a div element then find a different div element within the same parent
[18:31:29] <d3m0n> I know this is wrong but something like $(this).prev().find('sibling div) {}
[18:31:48] <kborchers> ?siblings @ d3m0n
[18:31:49] <bot-t> d3m0n, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[18:32:05] <d3m0n> Yes but that selects sibling within the element
[18:32:29] <acidjazz> kbochers http://jsfiddle.net/53vEw/
[18:32:44] <kborchers> $(this) would give you siblings of this, is that not what you want?
[18:33:26] <kborchers> acidjazz: outer is the element that can scroll http://jsfiddle.net/53vEw/1/
[18:33:42] <acidjazz> ah yea
[18:33:49] <acidjazz> hmm i didnt have that issue w/ this though
[18:34:09] <d3m0n> Ah yes kborchers ty
[18:34:17] <kborchers> np
[18:37:55] <Fallout2man> Um, stupid question here
[18:38:08] <Fallout2man> but Is there a simple way to mix vertical/horizontal swiping in jQuery mobile
[18:38:09] <Fallout2man> ?
[18:38:12] <Fallout2man> Because my problem is such.
[18:38:17] <Fallout2man> I have UI elements that need either or
[18:38:25] <Fallout2man> and after reading the docs you can configure swipe thresholds globally
[18:38:34] <Fallout2man> but I need both types
[18:38:44] <Fallout2man> And the event object sent doesn't tell me the swipe coordinates
[18:38:48] <Fallout2man> so I can't separate the two either
[18:38:50] <Fallout2man> um, help?
[18:40:24] <Fallout2man> Because I'd REAAAALLLY hate to have to hack the existing code-base just to enable one small feature on a single piece of content.

[18:51:41] <hugo_moss> whats the best way to animate a css dark mask with jquery?
[18:51:52] <hugo_moss> i tried rgba in css, and then fading that in, but theres a flicker
[18:52:03] <hugo_moss> i also tried the fadeTo in jquery, it flickers with that too
[18:52:18] <hugo_moss> it flickers mainly because its transitioning from such a light to dark background

[19:01:45] <ed4208> Has anyone had trouble getting the http status code from the jqXHR object?  I call jqXHR.status in my success and error methods in my ajax handler, but it only seems to return 200.  Even if I set it to anything else like 201, 202, etc.
[19:04:47] <shoky> ed4208: what kind of request is it?
[19:05:53] <ed4208> It's a jsonp request to the server, and the response is json.  Trying to make a restful api.
[19:06:24] <shoky> yeah you can't get the status from a jsonp request
[19:06:29] <shoky> that's not jqXHR
[19:06:40] <shoky> that's a <script> tag injected into your page
[19:07:02] <ed4208> that makes perfect sense
[19:07:58] <ed4208> are there any best practices when using jsonp, as far as responses?  I'm assuming using the http status code isn't going to work then.
[19:09:09] <shoky> you cant use CORS?
[19:09:17] <shoky> instead of jsonp
[19:09:46] <shoky> cause with CORS you can go wild with your status codes
[19:09:54] <shoky> i think.
[19:10:29] <shoky> i don't really know anything about implementing jsonp except for how the response needs to look like..
[19:13:40] <ed4208> shoky: I'm not familiar with CORS.  I'm reading about it now, and it looks like it might be a better solution overall.  Thanks for the suggestion.
[19:13:50] <shoky> np
[19:14:02] <shoky> yeah it's a better solution. jsonp is a hack
[19:16:21] <hiby007> is it safe to use jquery and prototype both together ??
[19:18:35] <shoky> hiby007: yes but you need to use jQuery.noConflict()
[19:18:40] <shoky> afaik
[19:19:12] <hiby007> ok
[19:19:32] <hiby007> i read on stackoverfow that it will break things
[19:19:34] <hiby007> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2644556/prototype-vs-jquery-strengths-and-weaknesses
[19:19:44] <hiby007> can you explain this ??
[19:20:02] <shoky> that page is not about using them together..
[19:20:12] <shoky> wrong link?
[19:20:56] <shoky> anyway, i dont use prototype myself so no idea really, but i remember reading that it's fine if you use noConflict()
[19:21:16] <hiby007> no i am not understanding the discussion takeing place on that page
[19:22:32] <shoky> smells in here
[19:23:40] <mdedetrich> i have an issue when using .val(some text) with textareas
[19:23:52] <hiby007> should i devote my time learning prototype ?? or should i stick to jQuery ??
[19:23:55] <mdedetrich> it appears to remove all line breaks from the value being passed in
[19:24:11] <mdedetrich> any way to stop this?
[19:25:41] <mdedetrich> actually nvm
[19:25:44] <mdedetrich> I know what it is
[19:40:19] <d3m0n> has anyone had trouble animating multiple jQuery UI sliders in a for each

[22:42:46] <Bauer> Problem is, that chrome gives me the error: Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/html: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/categories/ListCategories?callback=ListCategories".
[22:43:01] <Bauer> although I am doing exactly as in the tutorial... It hink
[22:43:32] <Bauer> and then the matching function           function ListCategories(data){                 alert(data);                 console.log(data);             } is not triggered either
