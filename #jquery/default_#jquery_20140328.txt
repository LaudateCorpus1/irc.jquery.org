[00:03:23] <slax0r> Hi, I need to clone a element, change it's attrs, as well as it's child elements attrs, and then append to dom, can this be done? I want to avoid appending first, and then searching for that elem
[00:06:39] <ravenzz> slax0r yep
[00:06:43] <ravenzz> ?clone @ slax0r
[00:06:58] <ravenzz> it is clone() read the docs though
[00:07:15] <ravenzz> because you can clone events and data too
[00:07:20] <ravenzz> if you need them
[00:08:13] <slax0r> you don't think I already did that? :) I just didn't understand it properly, if I would, I wouldn't ask this question :)
[00:08:34] <slax0r> so, $(elem).clone().attr("someattr", "newval"); will change the value of that attribute on the clone only?
[00:08:43] <ravenzz> correct
[00:10:03] <ravenzz> you may want to save $(elem).clone() in a variable and the work with the var
[00:10:36] <ravenzz> var elem = $(elem).clone(); elem.attr()
[00:10:57] <slax0r> great, tnx :)
[00:19:46] <seronis> can jquery on a page intercept an inline onload and replace it before executing ?
[00:21:41] <seronis> i tried  $('#divID').onload = function(){stuff()};  and  using  .attr('onload','stuff();').  neither worked
[00:22:35] <Cork> seronis: 1. onload isn't a jquery function or variable
[00:22:44] <Cork> 2. jquery never do $().<something> =
[00:22:53] <Cork> 3. <div> doesn't have a load event
[00:24:03] <seronis> the page im editing has an onload tag on one of its divs tht contains 2 function calls. 1 is bugged.  both are being called
[00:24:09] <seronis> im just trying to remove the bugged call
[00:24:28] <Cork> seronis: onload has no effect what so ever on a <div>
[00:25:14] <Cork> unless some script somewhere does something like eval(this.onload)
[00:28:06] <seronis> <div id='#name' onload="resizeImage('name1'); resizeImage('name2');">stuff</div>   this is the way the div shows up in the dom editor. name1 exists and is fine.  name2 does not exist and when the resize call is processed its leaving a typeerror exception in the console
[00:28:28] <seronis> i'll try to find if there is that eval() code somewhere else then
[00:28:35] <Cork> seronis: ya, that is dead code, unless some script somewhere runs it manually
[00:28:54] <seronis> ty for the info
[00:41:39] <fabioportieri> good morning and happy friday
[00:43:09] <Uhkis> happy friday to you as well fabioportieri
[00:44:16] <becca> happy friday
[01:34:27] <anli_> I want to listen on ckeditors blur event
[01:34:33] <anli_> Maybe thats not really jquery related

[02:33:43] <Varun_krishna> Hi everyone , I am in need of some suggestion
[02:43:14] <seutje> Varun_krishna: the number 7!
[03:17:25] <gingitsune> Morning
[03:18:59] <beancurd> 2sups!
[03:19:48] <gingitsune> I can't figure out how to accurately describe what i want
[03:20:26] <gingitsune> I have a table... i need it to be editable, but limited to predefined choices
[03:20:50] <gingitsune> The choices probably need to be get by ajax
[03:21:00] <gingitsune> does anyone have any idea what do i want? :D
[03:21:59] <Cork> gingitsune: sounds like you want autocomplete or dropdowns
[03:23:11] <hxm> hi, is possible to convert 20140323 to 2014-03-23 ?
[03:23:56] <gingitsune> Definitly! I'm just wondering how would i go about implementing that with a jquery plugin like tablesorter
[03:24:35] <beancurd> what's your backend?
[03:24:51] <gingitsune> vanilla php
[03:25:07] <beancurd> do you have money to spend or is this a personal thing?
[03:25:32] <Cork> js> pring(/(\d{4})(\d{2})(\d{2})/.exec('20140323').slice(1).join('-'))
[03:25:37] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:25:43] <Cork> js> print(/(\d{4})(\d{2})(\d{2})/.exec('20140323').slice(1).join('-'))
[03:25:48] <b-ot> Cork: 2014-03-23
[03:26:24] <Cork> hxm: so ya, there are several ways you can do it
[03:26:48] <gingitsune> Its for work, but as a 1week in novice developer i probably won't convince anyone we need to buy anything
[03:27:48] <Parsi> I cannot validate a dropdown menue
[03:27:51] <Parsi> menu*
[03:27:56] <Parsi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22709747/chosen-enabled-dropdown-validation-does-not-work
[03:28:00] <Parsi> explained there
[03:28:49] <gingitsune> beancurd, you can still link me. I'll gladly check whats out there
[03:29:18] <beancurd> gingitsune: oh if it's for work then it won't be a problem to convince anyone.
[03:29:34] <beancurd> managers love throwing money at things to solve problems.

[03:51:33] <slax0r> Hi, I'm cloning an element into a var, update a databa attribute and print the element out in dom, but the data attr does not get updated
[03:52:35] <Varun_krishna> Hello guys I am following this example http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/pages/ and I don't know how to redirect the pages.
[03:52:35] <Cork> slax0r: .data doesn't modify the attribute
[03:52:50] <Cork> slax0r: it mosifies the cache in jquery for the element
[03:55:21] <rolha> hi everyone, I'm doing a JQM page which involves lots of equation typesetting from MathJax. This can take quite a while in a mobile (10-20s). MathJax fortunately allows typesetting of elements individually. What would be the best way of triggering MathJax just, say, when a div is in view for the first time?
[03:55:50] <jmverges_> hi ther
[03:55:54] <jmverges_> there*
[03:56:31] <jmverges_> I'm looking for some plugin that allows to me to represent a window with icons like in OS
[03:56:40] <jmverges_> do you know something?
[03:56:49] <krambiorix> hi, when pushing a button, i add a new row in a table... After adding that , i want the first input or select element to be focussed... How can i do that?
[03:57:15] <Cork> krambiorix: .focus() on the element you want to focus
[03:57:23] <slax0r> Cork: this is what I work with: http://jsfiddle.net/CwpSs/
[03:57:30] <beancurd> $('#el').focus();
[03:57:39] <slax0r> and console.log of data attr is undefined, if I change it or not
[03:58:13] <Cork> slax0r: no need to $() wrap your jquery objects
[03:58:51] <slax0r> Cork: makes no difference
[03:58:53] <Cork> slax0r: http://jsfiddle.net/CwpSs/1/
[03:59:01] <jmverges_> anyone?
[03:59:28] <Cork> slax0r: your cloning the holder not the item
[03:59:57] <slax0r> Cork: I see now, oh my god...
[03:59:59] <slax0r> -.-
[04:00:20] <Cork> :)
[04:00:58] <krambiorix> Cork,  but how can i say : take an input if that's the first element or take a select box if that is the first element
[04:01:19] <Cork> krambiorix: row.find(':input').first().focus()
[04:02:10] <krambiorix> Cork, but a select box is not an input
[04:02:17] <Cork> ?api :input
[04:02:17] <b-ot> Cork: :input Selector: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[04:02:32] <Cork> notice the :
[04:03:29] <slax0r> Cork: this works nicely, as long as I clone only once, when I make more clones, all clones then have the same data attr value
[04:03:35] <slax0r> http://jsfiddle.net/CwpSs/2/
[04:05:12] <slax0r> Cork: forget it... fixed it: http://jsfiddle.net/CwpSs/3/
[04:05:18] <slax0r> thanks for your help
[04:05:31] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks for the lesson!!
[04:05:38] <Cork> slax0r: what did you change?
[04:06:09] <Cork> ah
[04:06:20] <Cork> right you cloned the holder so you got it multiple times :)
[04:19:32] <Snoopal> hey guys im using jquery mobile. when i use $('body').pagecontainer('change',url,{}); i get an error message Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on page prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'bindRemove' <- any idea?
[04:22:50] <donmatthew> Hi, I'm tring to disable a submit button after click. It works fine except it doesn't send the default FORM request when clicking it.. Any ideas why??
[04:23:18] <Cork> donmatthew: don't use click for submit
[04:23:21] <Cork> use the submit event
[04:23:25] <donmatthew> I do
[04:23:28] <donmatthew> sec, let me pastebin
[04:23:28] <Cork> and from there disable the submit button
[04:23:53] <donmatthew> http://pastebin.com/P36DiEzZ
[04:24:17] <donmatthew> aha
[04:24:21] <donmatthew> on('submit') u mean?
[04:24:24] <Cork> yes
[04:24:25] <donmatthew> instead of click?
[04:24:30] <Cork> $('form').submit()
[04:24:30] <donmatthew> thnx, ill try that
[04:24:35] <donmatthew> didnt read so good.. :)
[04:24:38] <Cork> also
[04:24:41] <Cork> don't use attr for state
[04:24:49] <Parsi> validation does not work for select: http://jsfiddle.net/maysamsh/rLQDK/25/
[04:24:49] <Cork> use prop('disabled', true/false)
[04:25:01] <Parsi> i don't figure out why
[04:25:19] <Cork> donmatthew: attr doesn't change the state of elements cross browsers
[04:25:27] <Cork> some listen for attr changes
[04:25:33] <Cork> but most only check for property changes
[04:31:56] <donmatthew> Cork: got it working, thank you
[04:32:11] <Cork> donmatthew: note the attr comment
[04:32:38] <donmatthew> Cork: yepp
[04:33:00] <donmatthew> $('form').bind('submit', function(e) { $(this).find('input:submit').attr('disabled', 'disabled'); });
[04:33:10] <donmatthew> this doesnt work neither with attr?
[04:33:22] <Cork> you should never use attr for that
[04:33:24] <Cork> use prop
[04:33:30] <donmatthew> ok
[04:33:31] <Archer_xda> You should use .prop("disabled", true) - not attr
[04:33:47] <Cork> ^
[04:34:01] <donmatthew> worked good
[04:34:02] <donmatthew> thnx
[04:34:08] <donmatthew> im all set. :D
[04:34:30] <Cork> donmatthew: attr is if you want to read the raw string from what was in the html
[04:34:43] <donmatthew> aha
[04:34:43] <Cork> donmatthew: if you want to modify or read what the browser modified something to
[04:34:45] <Cork> you use prop
[04:35:15] <Cork> donmatthew: basically prop(name) translates to elm[name]
[04:35:26] <Cork> and attr(name) translates to elm.getAttribute(name)
[04:37:04] <donmatthew> Cork: aha, thnx
[04:37:07] <donmatthew> good2know
[04:37:33] <Archer_xda> @Cork: Nicely explained
[04:43:27] <nights> hi
[04:43:39] <nights> after setting .html and then getting height() of an element
[04:43:47] <nights> do i need to put a pause between?
[04:43:51] <nights> to get the right height
[04:44:08] <BinaryKitten> nights depends on how you doing the setting and reading
[04:44:40] <nights> hm
[04:44:40] <nights> well
[04:45:10] <nights> http://jsfiddle.net/ydN32/
[04:45:13] <nights> this is how i do it
[04:45:47] <nights> i try to set the html , obviously, before i get the height
[04:45:52] <nights> and i make sure its visible
[04:46:13] <nights> it seems to work once
[04:46:22] <nights> but not if the text changes after that
[04:47:18] <Archer_xda> @nights - it should be okay if you're doing a regular .html("text") - http://jsfiddle.net/3DysM/
[04:48:00] <Archer_xda> Is there a reason you're asking this - have you had a problem with it?
[04:49:09] <nights> Archer_xda: yes it doesnt work for me
[04:49:27] <nights> but im using an inner div and im expecting that to set the outer div to the appropriate height
[04:49:32] <nights> which i then try to fetch
[04:51:47] <Archer_xda> nights: That still works fine - http://jsfiddle.net/3DysM/1/
[04:52:14] <Archer_xda> I suggest checking the element inspector to see what is affecting the height of the divs
[04:53:10] <nights> thanks - did you see my fiddle?
[04:53:11] <nights> http://jsfiddle.net/ydN32/
[04:54:43] <Archer_xda> nights: I did, yes, but without context that doesn't help.
[04:55:01] <nights> hm
[04:55:01] <nights> ok
[04:55:02] <Archer_xda> Like I said, check the element inspector before and after and see what's happening to the styles applied to the divs in question
[04:55:09] <nights> hm ok
[04:55:12] <vipconsult> hi , all I need a bit of help with this fiddle , http://jsfiddle.net/hpvpL/20/  , after the ajax request the modal is no longer binded. I understand why this happens , but can;t think of a solution. Could you point me to the right direction. ?
[04:56:49] <nights> Archer_xda: the height is animated from 0 to 100 each time
[04:57:07] <nights> this line isnt right
[04:57:07] <nights>             var target_height = s.height();
[04:57:20] <nights> s comes from
[04:57:21] <nights> var s = $('#checkout_helpholder');
[04:57:37] <nights> and the height of that element is changed by changing the html content of its inner div
[04:57:43] <nights> which is done on the line before
[04:58:14] <nights> let me try to alert() out the height right after i fetch s
[04:59:33] <nights> the outer div doesnt change its height
[05:00:12] <vipconsult> anyone to give me some advice with my problem : http://jsfiddle.net/hpvpL/20/ , after the ajax request the modal is no longer binded
[05:00:14] <nights> i think i know
[05:00:17] <Archer_xda> nights: It should do, which is why I say to look at the element inspector to see what is affecting the height
[05:01:14] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: You replace the entire body - modal does not exist after the 1st submit :)
[05:01:26] <vipconsult> sorry
[05:01:27] <vipconsult> sorryhttp://jsfiddle.net/hpvpL/21/
[05:01:30] <vipconsult> http://jsfiddle.net/hpvpL/21/
[05:01:42] <vipconsult> this is the correct onw
[05:01:56] <vipconsult> even if I replace just the link  , the modal is still unbinded
[05:04:37] <nights> Archer_xda: i solved it. i needed to set auto on the outerdiv otherwise it wouldnt adjust for the inner and i couldnt get the adjusted height
[05:04:40] <nights> so pretty simple
[05:04:43] <nights> thanks for looking
[05:05:25] <Archer_xda> That's okay.  Always remember to try debugging with what's in front of you, rather than assume a code error.  The element inspector and console in your browser can solve 99% of problems :)
[05:08:13] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: Just bind it again... http://jsfiddle.net/hpvpL/26/
[05:08:32] <Archer_xda> The binding is for an element that you have replaced.
[05:09:50] <vipconsult> actually I showed the wrong exmaple again , I am replacing the wholy body
[05:09:52] <vipconsult> http://jsfiddle.net/hpvpL/28/
[05:10:32] <vipconsult> Archer_xda : I tried with your suggestion , it works if you only replace one element , but if I replace the body it doens;t work
[05:10:44] <vipconsult> I am using this for form validation
[05:10:45] <ankurk_> Has anyone used bootstrap Datepicker?
[05:11:17] <vipconsult> Archer_xda : if the form passes validation it loads the result in the current page (body)
[05:11:40] <vipconsult> otherwise if the form doesn;t pass validation it loads the form result in the modal window to fix the errors
[05:11:41] <nights> Archer_xda: yeah, getting better and better at debugging jquery. problem for me is still when to expect sequential vs non-sequential execution behavior
[05:11:50] <BinaryKitten> ?ask @ ankurk_
[05:11:50] <b-ot> ankurk_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:12:27] <ankurk_> Well I want to set the date in the bootstrap datepicker, in a specific format
[05:13:15] <ankurk_> I have tried setDate but it just converts it to d/m/yyy format. I want it in string format instead
[05:13:58] <Archer_xda> nights: Pretty much everything but ajax (get, post, load etc.) is run sequentially so you don't normally have to think about it.  Async calls just force you to code in a more functional manner, which is very good practice to get into anyway.  Glad you got it working though :)
[05:14:00] <vipconsult> Archer_xda : can you offer some suggestion ?
[05:14:31] <vipconsult> this is the correct exmaple with the problem
[05:14:32] <vipconsult> http://jsfiddle.net/hpvpL/28/
[05:17:09] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: Just having a look.  1 thing - you're not using IE are you?
[05:18:15] <vipconsult> chrome
[05:19:52] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: That's okay.  There's an error in there that only IE would fall over on - a comma at the end of an object declaration (after the html value).  Wouldn't cause this issue but worth noting
[05:20:26] <vipconsult> this is the idea: open the form in a modal window  on submit > ajax send to server validation -> reply ok -> load result in the page body , reply not ok load the form result in the same modal window . Everyhting works ok , except that after the result is loaded in the body the modal links no longer work
[05:25:18] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: Okay, rather than replace everything, just replace the bit you need - I've given one of the divs an ID and just replace what's inside that.  No further binding is needed, so it makes it easier.  http://jsfiddle.net/hpvpL/32/
[05:26:34] <vipconsult> if the form validation doesn;t pass that is ok , I can replace only the modal dialog , but if the validation passes I need to replace the whole page
[05:27:09] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: Surely you don't replace it with the form again?
[05:27:22] <SprkDev> My modal bootstrap does not accept the submission form. I mean it does, it just closes when submit is pressed? How do I fix that?
[05:29:02] <vipconsult> Archer_xda  : this is the actual website http://dev.portal.vip-consult.co.uk:88/ , asdf@vip-consult.co.uk , 1234asdf ,
[05:29:25] <vipconsult> after login edit the profile ,
[05:30:00] <vipconsult> try to submit with emmpty company name
[05:30:13] <vipconsult> it will fail and reload the result in the modal
[05:30:28] <vipconsult> but if you enter company name it will pass and loads the new page
[05:31:37] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: I'd say that works fine.  I'm more confused now that I've seen that
[05:31:58] <vipconsult> why ?
[05:32:07] <vipconsult> what would be a better approach ?
[05:32:42] <vipconsult> this was my logic , if it passes validation load the result in the page , oherwise load the form again in the modal
[05:35:16] <nights> hm
[05:35:30] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: What is actually wrong with the current process?  If it fails then it tells you why and you need to correct it.  If it works then it's submitted.
[05:35:50] <nights> doesnt position().top get calculated correct on an element thats ajax loaded?
[05:35:58] <vipconsult> yes , but after it loads the new page the links don;t work anymore
[05:36:15] <vipconsult> Archer_xda : try to click the edit profile again after you submit once
[05:36:16] <nights> AH
[05:36:26] <nights> the position:relative on the holder element is the reason\
[05:36:27] <nights> of course..
[05:37:18] <slax0r> why is this different than on my machine: http://jsfiddle.net/CwpSs/4/
[05:37:34] <slax0r> on my machine, the li element is not cloned with the rest, and the data attr doesn't get updated
[05:37:52] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: Just bind to the edit link after you create it.  It's not like an event handler where you can use delegation.  The plugin only works on elements that exist at the time you call it.
[05:38:33] <vipconsult> yes , this is what I thought and tried it , but no good
[05:38:34] <vipconsult> http://jsfiddle.net/hpvpL/31/
[05:38:45] <vipconsult> this is the example that replicztes the issue
[05:41:32] <nights> i see
[05:41:35] <nights> offset() is my friend :)
[05:44:57] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: This works perfectly for me... http://jsfiddle.net/hpvpL/33/
[05:45:14] <Archer_xda> Stop replacing body - that rewrites the whole document.  Just replace what you need to replace.
[05:46:26] <nights> god
[05:46:33] <nights> cant believe i went with bootstrap 1 year ago
[05:46:47] <nights> theres not been a single component you cant create yourself in 20 minutes
[05:47:53] <vipconsult> yes , that works , but in the real example if the form passes validation ir actually needs to reload the whole page , not just the modal form
[05:48:59] <vipconsult> if I just reload the modal form then after they close the modal form it will still show the page before the changes , so for exmaple if they change the company name , I can show a message in the modal form , profile updated , but when they close the modal it will still show the old company name
[05:49:48] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: Wrap the contents in a div, like #target in the last fiddle, and replace the contents of that.  It is replacing body that is causing your problem and there is 0 reason you should have to do it
[05:49:57] <vipconsult> aha
[05:50:02] <vipconsult> ok I will try
[05:52:21] <dwarder> is there a way to wrap $('span.MyClass')  in div?
[05:53:04] <dwarder> if i have 4 <span class=MyClass>one<span> going one after another?
[05:53:14] <seutje> `wrapall
[05:53:21] <seutje> `api wrapall
[05:53:22] <b-ot> seutje: .wrapAll(): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[05:54:07] <dwarder> seutje: danke
[05:54:39] <seutje> erm... kein problem, I guess
[05:59:39] <vipconsult> Archer_xda : still a problem , since the page returns full html -> <html><body>....  , when I load the result in a div wrapper it becomes.- > <div id="wrapper"><html><body>....
[06:00:17] <Cork> vipconsult: you shouldn't return full html to ajax
[06:00:32] <seutje> did you mean to use an iframe?
[06:00:49] <vipconsult> I know , but this page is called form ohter functions which require full html
[06:01:10] <Cork> vipconsult: then what you are trying to do most likely won't work
[06:01:12] <vipconsult> and what if the client has no js enabled ,
[06:01:17] <Cork> cause you can't load a full page into another
[06:01:18] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: It sounds to me like you're mixing an ajaxified website with a plain old php or asp(.Net) site.  You need to either return just what you need, rely on old fashioned submits, or parse the incoming response and find the element you want to replace
[06:01:21] <Cork> it won't work
[06:02:24] <vipconsult> Archer_xda : or I can modife the page to detect when it is a ajax request and return only some part of the page
[06:02:39] <vipconsult> thanks for all your help I will see what I can come up with
[06:02:57] <Cork> vipconsult: ya, the last is what you should do
[06:03:41] <Archer_xda> vipconsult: something like - $("#target").html($(data).find("#target").html())
[06:04:06] <Cork> Archer_xda: it is better if you never send the access junk
[06:05:21] <zerobeholder_wor> I probably can't define my click event code in my constructor, can I? http://jsfiddle.net/CnZ9S/43/
[06:06:14] <Archer_xda> Cork: ???
[06:06:29] <zerobeholder_wor> Off the top of your heads, is there a github project I can study as a model. I know it is a fundamental chunk of how javascript works that I don't have a mental grasp on.
[06:06:32] <Varun_krishna> Hi guys I could not understand this function (live)  https://github.com/dearbanana/brinaldi-tut-localstorage/blob/mybranch/www/js/index.js#L72
[06:06:42] <Cork> Archer_xda: if you do the filtering server side you won't have to do the network traffic
[06:07:00] <Cork> Archer_xda: and as dom doesn't actually have a way to handle none body inner content
[06:07:02] <zerobeholder_wor> live was replaced by on
[06:07:12] <Cork> you have to depend on error correction to get .find to work
[06:07:31] <zerobeholder_wor> It is an event handler from days of yore.
[06:08:12] <Varun_krishna> then what is that pageshoe?
[06:08:39] <Varun_krishna> *pageshow, and sorry for that typo.
[06:08:55] <zerobeholder_wor> pageshow is the event that triggers the code that seems to grab the favorites from the database
[06:09:29] <Archer_xda> Cork: Of course there are a plethora of potential issues, but I get the impression he wants to do as little as possible to "ajaxify" his existing site.  I'd start there
[06:09:32] <Cork> zerobeholder_wor: also live was replaced by delegate not on
[06:09:46] <Cork> zerobeholder_wor: on merges delegate and bind
[06:10:35] <zerobeholder_wor> back when I think I used delegate-- because it would be persistent even when I was doing unthinkable things to the DOM. I never used live much.
[06:10:37] <SprkDev> How do I prevent form from closing when submitting, using bootstrap modal?
[06:10:39] <SprkDev> How do I prevent form from closing when submitting, using bootstrap modal?
[06:10:59] <Archer_xda> $("form").on("submit", function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[06:11:30] <Varun_krishna> do you mean this  db.transaction(loadFavesDb, txError, txSuccess); ?
[06:12:01] <Varun_krishna> that is does pageshow will call that function?
[06:12:41] <zerobeholder_wor> pageshow is something that happens in the browser that you can use as something to monitor for
[06:12:43] <zerobeholder_wor> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/pageshow
[06:14:15] <zerobeholder_wor> Once that event handler is activated by that page show -- it goes into an anonymous function which is passed the event object that triggered it.
[06:14:58] <Varun_krishna> even this document.addEventListener("deviceready",onDeviceready,false)
[06:15:00] <zerobeholder_wor> Inside that anonymous function is your database retrieval code which is passed a few parameters (likely members of the window object).
[06:15:10] <Varun_krishna> even that deviceready is one of the javascript events?
[06:15:52] <Macaveli> Any idea why this is not working in IE8 https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/3a2a633132ccce4357fd
[06:16:34] <zerobeholder_wor> I've never used javascript for device resources. I've limited myself to the browser resources. You are past the limits on my knowledge on that. AFK
[06:17:39] <Varun_krishna> Ok, What do you mean by AFK ?
[06:17:52] <Cork> Macaveli: should work, your using jquery 2.x?
[06:18:00] <Archer_xda> Away From Keyboard
[06:20:16] <Macaveli> Cork, eeuhm let me check that
[06:20:30] <Macaveli> Cork, it's showing but not spinning
[06:20:41] <Cork> Macaveli: what do you mean?
[06:20:50] <Macaveli> It's a spinner
[06:20:53] <Cork> 2.x doesn't support ie8 or older
[06:23:16] <Macaveli> Cork that's probably it
[06:23:20] <Macaveli> Thanks!
[06:24:01] <Varun_krishna> Archer_xda thanks
[06:25:11] <SprkDev> My jquery function in my single.php page is not working when it is  loaded in a modal on the author.php page. Why?
[06:29:13] <SprkDev> I NEED HELP?
[06:36:08] <rainb> Hello
[06:36:39] <rainb> How do I hide with a slide animation, the contents of an element are being moved towards a something until it dissapears
[06:36:45] <rainb> up
[06:36:51] <rainb> towards up
[06:45:54] <darkfrog> I just updated from jQueryUI 1.10.3 to 1.10.4 and the modal dialog comes up, but to the left and right of the dialog it isn't darkened but above and below is
[06:46:11] <darkfrog> I assume this isn't an intentional thing?
[06:46:37] <darkfrog> well, maybe it is: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal
[06:48:05] <rainb> So, does anyone know how to hide an element by sliding it with the edge of the parent element
[06:48:44] <rainb> Or more like, hide the children of the element by sliding them towards their parent.
[06:48:57] <frank_o> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7453897 -- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linkbubble.playstore
[06:49:01] <slax0r> rainb: what do you mean toward their parent?
[06:49:13] <slax0r> parent [ child -> [] ]
[06:49:15] <frank_o> What do you guys think? Can some of these ideas be transferred to jQuery Mobile or ones jQuery Mobile app, or have I completely misunderstood things?
[06:50:18] <frank_o> It's patented though so I dunno
[06:50:20] <slax0r> rainb: do you perhaps want something like this: https://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[06:50:22] <rainb> Like, say I have an element, that elements contains a list, I want to hide that list, like getting behind their parent
[06:50:25] <slax0r> scroll down for examples
[06:50:31] <Archer_xda> frank_o: jQuery mobile, by default, will ajaxify all links in your site so it does a lot of what linkbubble does anyway
[06:50:46] <frank_o> Archer_xda: Ah I see
[06:50:54] <darkfrog> does nobody else see this?  It seems like a glaring bug in modal dialogs...
[06:51:12] <frank_o> Archer_xda: Doesn't it do some sorta "loading stuff in the background" stuff too?
[06:51:16] <rainb> slax0r, okay I think it is this, lemme see tho
[06:51:47] <shoky> darkfrog: looks like a "bug" in the 1.10.4 theme
[06:52:50] <darkfrog> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9917
[06:53:03] <darkfrog> shoky: thanks, it seems crazy this hasn't been resolved yet
[06:54:15] <rainb> slax0r: Oh, no, this is like what I have, it behaves more like a curtain, rather than the whole element being slided away
[06:54:44] <frank_o> darkfrog: We should all -- once our apps start making millions -- pour some millions back into the development of jQuery and jQuery-related projects
[06:55:13] <frank_o> I get the feeling not many successful entrepreneurs do. Once they make the big bucks, they lose themselves and forget where they came from.
[06:55:34] <Archer_xda> darkfrog: Put this in your css : .ui-widget-overlay { background-image: none; }
[06:55:45] <rainb> You can help jQuery without the aid of those millions by reading jquery's code and contribooting
[06:56:01] <slax0r> rainb: then give it a relative position in slide it away with .animate({"top":"-heighofelementpx"});
[06:56:19] <frank_o> Can, sure
[06:56:29] <shoky> darkfrog: as the ticket says, just get the theme from the download builder
[06:56:32] <frank_o> Contribooooootin'
[06:56:54] <rainb> contripoopin
[07:02:33] <aro> poopiter
[07:03:15] <rainb> slax0r: I guess, if I want to do that I need a parent that hides overflow, that would be a bit nonsemantic
[07:03:28] <rainb> hmm very well
[07:19:29] <SprkDev> I can't get my ajax to work.
[07:19:31] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/tVAUBFDn
[07:21:49] <DerKirche> SprkDev: where's the jQuery?
[07:23:39] <Cork> there is none, he's using native js
[07:23:39] <Archer_xda> SprkDev: What's javascript:add_comment ?
[07:23:49] <Archer_xda> There's no function called add_comment in the code you've shown us
[07:24:09] <Archer_xda> Looks like you should be calling loadXMLDoc("add_comment", ....
[07:24:35] <m6> also, variable "comment" is used but not declared anywhere in loadXMLDoc
[07:24:38] <Cork> also there is no reason to have javascript: in the event attribute
[07:24:53] <Cork> it haven't been needed for over 15 years
[07:25:29] <Cork> *hasn't
[07:27:42] <Archer_xda> But it does work so that's not a reason for it not working.  There's lots about this that *could* be done better.
[07:28:04] <Archer_xda> Not assigning event handlers inline, for a start
[07:28:16] <zerobeholder_wor> My OOP javascript is not fantastic. Is there a good basic library you can recommend on github, jsfiddle, codepen, etc that shows event triggers in the Constructor of an object?
[07:28:48] <zerobeholder_wor> Just something working to start with so I can play with it and see what I am doing wrong.
[07:28:49] <rainb> that shows event triggers?
[07:28:56] <rainb> As in manually triggering some event?
[07:29:04] <zerobeholder_wor> .click and .change specifically...
[07:29:17] <zerobeholder_wor> Or am I just plain barking up the wrong tree?
[07:29:46] <bowenac> anyone see anything wrong with this 		var something = jQuery('.fc-agenda-days').find(awesome).text(); jQuery(this).attr('data-class', something);
[07:29:56] <rainb> You can just log the click events if that's what you mean
[07:30:14] <BillCriswell> bowenac: What is awesome?
[07:30:14] <rainb> or if you don't have control ever that you can override addEventListener
[07:30:21] <bowenac> .fc-agenda-days value does not have a space at the end... but when I add the attr data-class its putting a space at the end of the value
[07:30:36] <bowenac> var awesome = '.' + jQuery(this).attr('class');
[07:30:36] <BillCriswell> We can't possible know if something is wrong without knowing what awesome is and knowing what youre html looks like.
[07:30:46] <BillCriswell> bowenac: And what is this there?
[07:31:01] <BillCriswell> s/youre/your
[07:32:14] <bowenac> this is the value I am getting <th class="fc-sun fc-col0 fc-widget-header" style="width: 116px;">Sun 3/23</th>
[07:32:21] <zerobeholder_wor> I was trying to set a click event in the constructor ie $(selectorid).click() { anonymous function };
[07:32:46] <zerobeholder_wor> But that wasn't working. Inside the anonymous function is a lot of
[07:32:50] <BillCriswell> bowenac: It would be a lot easier if you just made a fiddle.
[07:32:52] <zerobeholder_wor> CSS manipulation.
[07:32:58] <bowenac> this is what the value looks like after this.attr <td data-class="Sun 3/23&nbsp;" class="fc-sun">
[07:33:19] <rainb> zerobeholder_wor: You mean you want to set a click event
[07:33:31] <rainb> as in
[07:33:37] <rainb> set a listener or trigger the event
[07:34:10] <zerobeholder_wor> http://jsfiddle.net/CnZ9S/43/ is what I am working with trying to make it a two line load. It was working sort of how I liked at version 26 or so.
[07:34:29] <zerobeholder_wor> Crap, have to go fix something.
[07:38:14] <rainb> if you're just going to get an element by id, why use the jQuery function and gettting the first index instead of- getting it by it's id.
[07:39:04] <Cork> rainb: he wants the raw dom element
[07:39:12] <Cork> without the jquery wrapper
[07:39:14] <rainb> Exactly
[07:39:32] <rainb> So, why using the jquery wrapper
[07:39:40] <rainb> to get the raw element
[07:39:53] <rainb> instead of just.. getting it.
[07:40:02] <Cork> he is just getting it
[07:40:04] <rainb> ..Directly.
[07:40:17] <Cork> or do you mean to use document.getElementById instead of $() ?
[07:40:39] <Cork> count the number of chars and you know why :)
[07:41:00] <zerobeholder_wor> That all works okay-- it is when I try to add the event that was the worst problem, additionally modifying the CSS stopped working.
[07:41:25] <Cork> zerobeholder_wor: store the element as you add them instead
[07:41:39] <Cork> and then just attach the event listeners on those variables
[07:41:48] <zerobeholder_wor> that is a good idea
[07:41:52] <Cork> also you really don't want to append all the elements one at a time
[07:42:03] <Cork> collect them in a bunch and do it all in one go
[07:42:14] <zerobeholder_wor> I will try it at lunch. I am new to js OOP and it goes poorly.
[07:42:31] <rainb> Cork: hmm what I want to append an array of elements
[07:42:45] <Cork> rainb: yes
[07:42:52] <rainb> what if*
[07:42:54] <Cork> you want to create a fragment and append it
[07:43:02] <rainb> oh
[07:43:10] <Cork> instead of parent.append(child) /* loop */
[07:43:36] <Cork> cause each append will trigger a page reflow
[07:43:41] <Cork> and those are costly
[07:43:53] <Cork> and if you do them over and over again you waits A LOT of time
[07:44:22] <Cork> i would guess at about 60-70% of the code time in his page is reflow
[07:44:32] <Cork> for that specific snippet i mean
[07:44:41] <krambiorix> i have a table with input fields that might have a class "mandatory"... The user needs to fill in those fields... Is there a selector that checks if all mandatory fields are filled in?
[07:44:43] <rainb> less than if you use jquery wrapper to get an element
[07:44:48] <rainb> But I see
[07:45:02] <rainb> I did know about document fragment but never found how to use it
[07:45:02] <ankurk_> krambiorix: ":input" selector maybe?
[07:45:08] <Cork> rainb: no that wasn't the point
[07:45:23] <rainb> That's interesting to know
[07:45:26] <rainb> so thank you
[07:45:27] <Cork> rainb: what i talked about was append, and it accepts both dom elements, strings and jquery objects
[07:45:51] <Cork> $('')[0] will only get you the first element, but as id's can ever only match one element
[07:45:54] <Cork> it is fine
[07:45:59] <kostodo> How would I watch for a changing value inside an input box .val() and show it updated in a new div?
[07:46:14] <krambiorix> errrmmm ankurk_  ?
[07:46:16] <Cork> kostodo: bind an input event
[07:46:30] <rainb> like onchange?
[07:46:34] <zerobeholder_wor> Thanks. AFK Will try to help with 'low hanging fruit' questions while I am recoding it during lunch.
[07:46:46] <kostodo> Cork: .change?
[07:46:56] <Cork> krambiorix: you would have to use a validator plugin or do something manually
[07:47:00] <Archer_xda> krambiorix : $("input.mandatory").map(function() { return this.value === ""; }).length
[07:47:06] <Cork> kostodo: no on('input')
[07:47:13] <Cork> ?mdn input event
[07:47:13] <b-ot> Cork: input - Web technology reference | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/input
[07:47:21] <Archer_xda> That will be true for all fields having a value and false if any do not
[07:47:44] <Archer_xda> Sorry - wrong way round
[07:47:51] <Cork> Archer_xda: if all you want to know if there is something in them
[07:47:58] <rainb> Oh, that's interesting
[07:48:00] <Cork> not if you need to check that they are filled in correctly
[07:48:18] <Archer_xda> mandatory isn't a type, so I'm guessing he means mandatory :p
[07:48:40] <rainb> Whoa
[07:48:47] <rainb> now I am surprised
[07:48:59] <Cork> Archer_xda: i meant he prob want to check numericality and similar things
[07:49:06] <Cork> check that email is email and so on
[07:49:12] <Cork> rainb: about what?
[07:49:30] <rainb> About some stuff mentioned
[07:49:46] <Archer_xda> Cork: I know, but he's only asked how to check if mandatory fields are populated
[07:50:04] <Cork> Archer_xda: "filled in", and it can mean either
[07:50:18] <krambiorix> Archer_xda, thanks!!
[07:50:42] <Archer_xda> Cork: "filled in" does not have anything to do with type.  Both "mandatory" and "filled in" literally mean "not empty" - nothing else.
[07:50:54] <Archer_xda> krambiorix : No problem :)
[07:51:12] <rainb> How do I find out if an element matches a selector
[07:51:14] <Archer_xda> Cork: I know what you're saying, but he clearly doesn't want type validation
[07:51:26] <krambiorix> Cork,  the field has just to be filled in , no need to do validation
[07:51:31] <Cork> rainb: $().is('selector')
[07:51:36] <krambiorix> Cork, but thanks to open the discussion :)
[07:52:04] <Cork> krambiorix: i've just learned to not answer questions until i've gotten all the answer
[07:52:16] <Cork> or expect the solution that covers all edges
[07:52:27] <Cork> as it tend to go wrong otherwise
[07:53:39] <krambiorix> :p
[07:58:06] <krambiorix> is it possible to remove a class using a wildcard? For example i have classes on errored fields like unique_error, mandatory_error .... I would like to remove *_error ...
[07:58:47] <Cork> krambiorix: no, you can't easily do that
[07:58:49] <Archer_xda> I *think* a regular expression on this.className would be the only way
[07:58:55] <Cork> ya
[07:59:04] <decx> it works but it has pitfalls
[07:59:09] <krambiorix> Cork, ow that's a pitty
[07:59:11] <apipkin> I'm taking a stab at building a jquery widget. I'm wanting to build something basic that I can add new functionality to by simply including other files. Is there a good example of this somewhere? For instance, if my widget was called `Robot`, I could create an addon that would be `Robot.JetPack` or `Robot.XRayVision` and then I could have a robot that either
[07:59:11] <apipkin> had a jetpack or xray vision or both
[07:59:17] <decx> for example, is that the only class on that element
[07:59:30] <Cork> krambiorix: i would prob go with spliting it up into an error and one of the other
[07:59:48] <decx> ye why not mandatory error
[07:59:51] <Cork> krambiorix: then you can do $('.error').removeClass('error unique mandatory ...')
[08:00:13] <Cork> or what ever you want to do
[08:00:18] <DarsVaeda> can I assign variables to the scope of a script called with getscript? I mean so I don't have to pollute the global scope
[08:00:33] <Cork> spliting up classes is often a good solution to wanting to do things like this :)
[08:00:52] <Cork> DarsVaeda: just add a scope inside the script file
[08:00:57] <Cork> (function() {})()
[08:01:12] <Cork> and the things you want global you attach to window.<global name>
[08:01:15] <krambiorix> Cork, hmmm i don't knwo
[08:01:39] <DarsVaeda> no I mean pass a variable to the script
[08:01:52] <krambiorix> Cork, or is there something like if($(this).attr('class') in(array('error_unique','error_mandatory'.....) ?
[08:01:53] <Cork> DarsVaeda: not really
[08:02:12] <Cork> DarsVaeda: you can have the script create a function
[08:02:20] <Cork> and then call that function passing in the variables
[08:02:47] <Cork> DarsVaeda: i did a parser hack for jquery where getScript returned a function to the complete callback
[08:02:51] <Cork> that you could execute
[08:03:03] <Cork> and the function was a generated wrapper around the script loaded :)
[08:03:18] <Cork> i used it before i went csp
[08:03:25] <DarsVaeda> okay I do not want to go that far ^^
[08:03:25] <pagioss> how can i change the bluecolor http://pbrd.co/1h2U7Hd
[08:03:28] <DarsVaeda> what is csp?
[08:03:42] <Cork> DarsVaeda: its actually fairly simple
[08:03:44] <Cork> ?mdn csp
[08:03:44] <b-ot> Cork: Introducing Content Security Policy - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy
[08:04:16] <pagioss> hi Cork any idea? having hard time changing the bluecolor of that checkbox
[08:04:25] <decx> why do you want to pass a variable to that script anyway? would be better to have it agnostic and do that stuff in the callback
[08:04:38] <Cork> pagioss: can't debug an image
[08:05:04] <Cork> decx: if you fetch js for an action to happen that is the flow you want
[08:05:07] <pagioss> Cork: but usually how do you set a color on the background of the checkbox icon?
[08:05:24] <Cork> pagioss: background-color: <color>;
[08:05:34] <decx> don't bother styling checkboxes
[08:05:37] <Cork> what selector or if you need to handle an image depends on the page
[08:05:40] <decx> crossbrowser nightmare
[08:05:45] <DarsVaeda> decx: I have a click handler on a button and call a script depending on the button id but I also would want to pass the context like what button was clicked
[08:05:49] <Cork> decx: it isn't actually
[08:05:54] <Cork> quite easy
[08:05:57] <pagioss> Cork: and element ? input[type=checkbox]:checked + label {
[08:06:00] <decx> it's terrible cork
[08:06:07] <Cork> decx: not really
[08:06:14] <decx> just use a style span for more flexibility
[08:06:22] <Cork> decx: you just add a separate label element, and display: none; the checkbox
[08:06:35] <decx> well yes but that's not styling the checkbox per se
[08:06:40] <Cork> then you have a fully customizable checkbox
[08:06:43] <Cork> and no need for js
[08:06:50] <decx> true label rocks
[08:06:56] <Cork> ya
[08:06:57] <decx> still stuck in the span mindset :D
[08:07:00] <pagioss> input[type=checkbox]:checked + label {  doesnt work for me it colors the whole line not the background of the checkbox
[08:07:24] <Cork> pagioss: please provide something we can look at
[08:07:30] <BillCriswell> pagioss: You're selecting the label with that selector.
[08:07:32] <Cork> jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com
[08:07:46] <decx> that's targeting a label that is after a checked checkbox
[08:08:16] <Cork> DarsVaeda: anyway
[08:08:31] <Cork> DarsVaeda: converters: { 'text script': createFunc } passed to ajaxSetup or $.ajax
[08:08:45] <pagioss> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/7fAua/
[08:08:47] <Cork> function createFunc(code) { return new Function('args', '"use strict";' + code); }
[08:08:59] <Cork> that is all you need to get a function from scripts instead of execution :)
[08:09:55] <DarsVaeda> ahh yes
[08:10:03] <DarsVaeda> I'll try that thanks :)
[08:10:05] <Archer_xda> DarsVaeda: That sounds to me the exact time that you *should* use global vars
[08:10:45] <kostodo> Cork, trying $('input').on('input', function()... but says object has no method 'on'
[08:10:59] <Cork> kostodo: older jquery?
[08:11:07] <Cork> use .bind in that case
[08:11:10] <pagioss> BillCriswell: how can i select the background instead of the label
[08:11:13] <kostodo> Yeah probably
[08:11:25] <kostodo> Cork: can you give me an example with .bind?
[08:11:28] <Archer_xda> DarsVaeda - this looks interesting... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15048551/getscript-local-load-instead-of-global
[08:11:43] <Cork> kostodo: s/on/bind/
[08:11:48] <Cork> kostodo: only change
[08:12:07] <DarsVaeda> Archer_xda: that was my initial idea, but I shrug because of eval
[08:12:10] <Archer_xda> kostodo: type $.fn.jquery in the console and see what it returns
[08:12:12] <decx> pagioss like i wrote, styling checkboxes directly is a fools errand, use your label as a replacer instead
[08:12:21] <DarsVaeda> Cork's idea sound better
[08:12:33] <Archer_xda> DarsVaeda: getScript uses eval - there's no other way to run a script after loading it
[08:12:35] <pagioss> decx: wat do you mean by that
[08:12:49] <drej> styling a checkbox is not possible with just css
[08:12:49] <Cork> pagioss: you can style the background of the checkbox element with input[type=checkbox]:checked
[08:13:00] <kostodo> Cork: cannot read property of 'fn' of undefined
[08:13:02] <decx> you can hide your checkbox and create a pseudo checkbox with label:before
[08:13:06] <kostodo> Cork: thats probably coz its Drupal 7
[08:13:11] <Cork> pagioss: but for most systems you won't see much of it, as that is the element behind the checkbox
[08:13:15] <kostodo> And yes I think they use an older jQuery
[08:13:33] <Cork> wait fn undefined??
[08:13:43] <Cork> what are you running exactly?
[08:13:45] <dan_j> Hi, can anyone recommend a nice jquery graph solution that animates on load?
[08:13:53] <kostodo> Cork: Drupal 7
[08:14:00] <pagioss> input[type=checkbox]:checked  {    color: black !important;   background: #ffd400 !important;    }  doest style it Corey
[08:14:01] <pagioss> Cork
[08:14:10] <Cork> kostodo: no i meant $('input').bind('input', function() {}) should not giva that error
[08:14:23] <Cork> pagioss: depend on what part of it you mean by styling
[08:14:38] <kostodo> Cork: with .bind I'm not seeing any error in console
[08:14:39] <pagioss> Cork  the bluecolor http://pbrd.co/1h2U7Hd
[08:14:44] <kostodo> But its not doing what I wanted it to do
[08:15:22] <Cork> pagioss: this sounds like os specific and something you can't control
[08:15:29] <kostodo> Cork: if I use .after to inject a div, and then use .text to put the result of a .val into it, should it work?
[08:15:31] <Cork> pagioss: cause i don't have anything with blue color in that page
[08:15:46] <dan_j> Actually, a better description is a charting solution.
[08:15:52] <pagioss> The checkbox next to education Corey
[08:15:53] <decx> pagiosshttp://jsfiddle.net/decx/7fAua/3/
[08:15:53] <pagioss> Cork
[08:16:00] <decx> pagioss http://jsfiddle.net/decx/7fAua/3/
[08:16:03] <Cork> kostodo: after bind?
[08:16:18] <Cork> pagioss: that checkbox is gray here
[08:16:22] <Cork> nothing blue there
[08:16:33] <Cork> meaning it is os native theming
[08:16:48] <Cork> and something you can't control on the checkbox directly
[08:16:57] <kostodo> Cork: No. First I inject div with .after, then I .bind on input, inside the .bind function I get input's .val and then set div .text
[08:17:03] <kostodo> Cork: sounds reasonable right?
[08:17:14] <kostodo> Cork: however I'm not getting anything showing up in my div
[08:17:24] <Cork> kostodo: should work i think
[08:17:28] <Cork> not fully sure of the flow
[08:18:08] <kostodo> Cork: why not .change?
[08:18:39] <Cork> kostodo: cause it will fire when the field loses focus
[08:18:46] <Cork> not when the user interact with it
[08:19:50] <kostodo> Cork: actually to cut a long story short, I've got a jquery ui slider and when i pull the handles it updates the value in min and max input fields
[08:20:11] <kostodo> Cork: just want to mirror those input fields in min max divs I have injected
[08:20:12] <Cork> kostodo: that won't fire any events on the input element
[08:20:25] <Cork> you need to catch the slide event from the slider
[08:20:34] <kostodo> When i drag the handles its already updating the input field values
[08:21:08] <pagioss> decx: http://pbrd.co/1h306M2
[08:21:19] <pagioss> that yellow box appears in that corner see?
[08:21:25] <Archer_xda> kostodo: Yes, but that update will not fire any events.  Can you not use event handlers on the slider?
[08:21:54] <kostodo> Nope, not without hacking the Drupal module - but I can't do that.
[08:22:23] <Cork> kostodo: why not?
[08:22:24] <Archer_xda> What is the slider control though?
[08:22:30] <Cork> just use a selector to find the slider element
[08:22:33] <Archer_xda> Can you link us to an example?
[08:22:40] <decx> pagioss i have no idea what else is styling your boxes, but it looks like it's having a checkbox replacer already
[08:22:49] <kostodo> It's Drupal Better Exposed Filters module
[08:22:55] <Cork> and do $().on('slider-slide') (i think that was the name)
[08:22:57] <pagioss> decx: its jqm
[08:23:25] <Cork> ah no no prefix
[08:23:37] <Cork> $().on('slide', function() {})
[08:23:41] <Cork> should get you the info you need
[08:23:45] <decx> i gave you a quite simple example of a checkbox replacer using :before, no idea what you have to do with jqm as i don
[08:23:48] <decx> 't use it
[08:24:13] <Cork> they already do styling of checkboxes
[08:24:48] <kostodo> Cork: what do I select tho?
[08:25:10] <Cork> kostodo: check in the dom for the element that is the slider
[08:25:25] <Cork> it should have a class uislider if i remember correctly
[08:25:27] <Archer_xda> kostodo - right-click the slider and do "inspect element" to see how it can be selected with jQuery
[08:25:39] <Archer_xda> Ideally with an ID
[08:25:45] <kostodo> Yeah I'm trying that. There are two input boxes, one is MIN one is MAX
[08:26:06] <Archer_xda> Can you link us to a page where we can see this?
[08:26:36] <Cork> pagioss: is this what your trying to do? http://jsfiddle.net/2LM6E/
[08:26:50] <kostodo> Archer_xda: Unfortunately no its local
[08:27:11] <Archer_xda> kostodo: Can you not find an example of that module online though?
[08:27:12] <kostodo> Being told OBJECT has no method 'on'
[08:27:28] <Cork> kostodo: again use .bind if your jquery is too old for .on
[08:27:36] <kostodo> https://drupal.org/project/better_exposed_filters
[08:27:51] <Cork> on is just a new combination name for bind and delegate
[08:27:56] <Cork> so you can just replace on with bind
[08:28:00] <Archer_xda> I've seen that already.  It doesn't have an example of it on the page
[08:28:11] <EnlightenMental> I'm using the autocomplete feature of jQuery UI.. on select / change of the autocomplete object, I run a filter which grabs the input val().. however, the value is what was typed ("SAMP") instead of what was selected from the autocomplete ("SAMPLE") Autocomplete doesnt update the input value fast enough.. anyone ever experienced this?
[08:28:40] <Cork> kostodo: just look at the generated dom in the browser
[08:28:50] <Cork> kostodo: it should be fairly easy to get it working
[08:29:06] <kostodo> Yeah I am, theres a div wrapping two input boxes (min and max)
[08:29:13] <kostodo> Tried on the wrapper div but no joy
[08:29:27] <Cork> did you say you had a slider?
[08:29:36] <Cork> THAT is what you want to work with
[08:29:46] <kostodo> Yes the slider is there
[08:29:49] <Archer_xda> EnlightenMental: You need to handle the select event... select: function (event, ui) { alert(ui.item.value); }
[08:30:00] <Cork> kostodo: then it is your target not the data containers
[08:30:14] * Cork signs off for the week
[08:30:29] <EnlightenMental> Archer_xda: thats what I'm doing select: function() { console.log( $('#auto').val() ) }
[08:30:43] <EnlightenMental> Archer_xda: but the value is what I typed.. not what Ive just selected
[08:30:44] <BillCriswell> Cork: It's good for your health.
[08:30:55] <decx> have a good weekend Cork
[08:30:56] <Archer_xda> EnlightenMental - look at the value in my example - it's not the input
[08:31:19] <EnlightenMental> right, but the function that runs on select/change... needs to use val()... not ui.value
[08:31:27] <EnlightenMental> Archer_xda:  ^
[08:31:49] <Archer_xda> EnlightenMental - ui.value is the selected item, which you said is what you want to get
[08:32:07] <EnlightenMental> Archer_xda: mostly yes, but that select even updates the input value
[08:32:39] <EnlightenMental> Archer_xda: for example.. on a refresh, the function has to look for val()... since ui.value doesnt exist
[08:33:06] <EnlightenMental> Archer_xda: val() seems like a better fallback.. for #history / #hash, etc
[08:33:42] <Archer_xda> EnlightenMental: val() is the value in the input.  Using ui.item.value will give you the value that is selected when it is selected.  They're two completely different things.
[08:33:54] <Archer_xda> Refresh won't cause a select
[08:34:06] <EnlightenMental> Archer_xda: right, but that select event update the val()
[08:34:41] <bowenac> anyone see anything wrong with this http://pastebin.com/z836ejVe
[08:34:51] <bowenac> line 5
[08:35:18] <kostodo> Cork, Archer_xda: got it working finally - thanks. But its not very accurate! :)
[08:35:29] <bowenac> seems to not be finding the weekday part
[08:35:45] <kostodo> When I drag the slider handle all the way to zero depending how fast I do it it doesn't update in time
[08:36:10] <BillCriswell> bowenac: Is there an error? If not your logic is just off.
[08:36:11] <kostodo> Very strange
[08:36:13] <EnlightenMental> Archer_xda: I can show if you you dont mind a PM
[08:36:24] <BillCriswell> bowenac: console.log() all the things.
[08:36:43] <Archer_xda> EnlightenMental: okay
[08:37:55] <bowenac> updated paste http://pastebin.com/kqD1G2hT
[08:38:49] <bowenac> no errors it just not working, if I remove the weekday part it will work but not how I want it to work. That is retreiving data from db and inserting the value into a cell that matches both criteria without the weekday part it will insert in every cell that matches the time
[08:38:51] <kostodo> Archer_xda: any idea?
[08:39:30] <zerobeholder_wor> pastebin filtered by the IT dept...
[08:39:37] <zerobeholder_wor> Thanks guys.
[08:39:55] <bowenac> even when I hard code the weekday like "Sun 3/23 " still get nothing
[08:40:14] <bowenac> since the dates are being inserted with a space at the end
[08:40:22] <BillCriswell> bowenac: What if you do "Sun 3/23&nbsp;" ?
[08:40:35] <BillCriswell> bowenac: Why are they?
[08:42:36] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/CLrJV4hN New comment not getting added to the comment list.
[08:43:39] <bristleback> hi
[08:43:52] <Archer_xda> kostodo: Sorry, but without being able to even see the controls in question in a page then there's no way I can even guess
[08:44:18] <bristleback> is there a similar function to closest() in jquery but which will traverse the dom downwards?
[08:44:27] <BillCriswell> bristleback: .find()
[08:44:32] <bristleback> find
[08:44:33] <bristleback> ok
[08:44:34] <bristleback> thanks
[08:44:54] <SprkDev> Do I need to remove submit action input type submit once I implement jquery add?
[08:44:58] <bowenac> why are the spaces there?
[08:44:59] <bristleback> no
[08:45:07] <bristleback> find is not ok for what I need
[08:45:39] <bristleback> now I realized that find will search the entire document if it is not attached to an element on the page
[08:46:03] <bristleback> I need something similar to chid()
[08:46:10] <BillCriswell> bristleback: .... What?
[08:46:23] <bristleback> children() sorry
[08:46:29] <BillCriswell> $el.find('.any-descendent')
[08:46:34] <zerobeholder_wor> You can iterate through using array indexes...
[08:48:12] <zerobeholder_wor> $('#miscDiv')[0] is the DOM element with id="misc"
[08:48:25] <Ownix> Im using mouseenter and mouseleave and setTimeout to set a delay before performing these functions but it would be really nice if nothing in mouseenter executed until the mouse has been in there for a period of time
[08:50:04] <bristleback> BillCriswell: when .closest() is attached to an element, it will search from that element up, including itselft, for another element specified as an argument
[08:50:28] <Ownix> I suppose I could start a countdown timer
[08:50:32] <zerobeholder_wor> Ownix: maybe a while loop
[08:50:32] <BillCriswell> bristleback: Right.
[08:50:58] <kostodo> Is .text() known to be slow?
[08:51:14] <bristleback> BillCriswell: with find on the other hand, if I attach it to a DOM element, it will only search for an element specified as an argument inside the DOM element to which is was attached
[08:51:26] <bristleback> downwards, of course
[08:51:32] <bristleback> isn't that true?
[08:52:09] <BillCriswell> bristleback: I think I got you now. So you want to filter out elements you have selected?
[08:52:23] <BillCriswell> Not select any of their descendents?
[08:52:25] <zerobeholder_wor> Ownix: set a date variable and while the set date comparison is too little let the loop not execute. Then while mouse enter / mouse over is enough fire off your functions.
[08:53:11] <Ownix> zerobeholder_wor: so compare the date and time basically? while ( DateTime.Now < DateTime.Now + 5 seconds)
[08:53:19] <systemfault> lol
[08:53:30] <BillCriswell> bristleback: If you do like $('li') and you want to only grab the ones that have a specific class you can do $('li').filter('.these-ones-please')
[08:54:27] <systemfault> Ownix: You need to use a setTimeout-based loop and compare at every iteration if Date.now() is greater than X
[08:54:42] <zerobeholder_wor> well, you'll want that on a time out, but sure.
[08:54:43] <systemfault> Ownix: A while loop won’t work, you’ll be freezing the browser.
[08:54:52] <bristleback> BillCriswell: sort of both :) I generate HTML code and I will inject it on the page, but before I do that, I will attach an event to the first "input" in that generated content; the event states that on("blur"), the next input element will be changed accordingly
[08:55:06] <zerobeholder_wor> The while loop is in his looping timeout function
[08:55:39] <bristleback> BillCriswell: so, I know the element that trigers the event, but I don't know what's after it, I only know I'm looking for an input element
[08:55:52] <Ownix> systemfault: can you find me any examples of a setTimeout-based loop?
[08:56:12] <BillCriswell> bristleback: So you want the next input element with an indefinite amount of siblings between?
[08:56:15] <zerobeholder_wor> I usually set one timeout loop and a counter. Your set timeout function calls itself at the end.
[08:56:19] <krizoek> var catalog = transaction.objectStore("catalog"); catalog.clear(); $.each(data, function(i){ _(catalog.add(this)); })  <-- in this example, what do the _ mean in  _(catalog.add(this));   ??
[08:56:38] <bristleback> BillCriswell: something like that.
[08:56:52] <bristleback> and searching for it downwards
[08:57:22] <BillCriswell> bristleback: If if you're on an li, you want the next li then the input inside that?
[08:57:41] <duch_kazatel> anybody here familiar with the Fritz and Ken's ale that Sierra Nevada released a while ago?
[08:58:09] <bberry> is there a way to get the list of selected element in an event handler? Like $("#foo, #bar").on("click", function(){ var selectedElems = ???? });
[08:58:10] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: No.. beer sounds great right about now, though.
[08:58:11] <systemfault> Ownix: http://jsfiddle.net/nwArk/
[08:58:17] <bristleback> BillCriswell: I will try to paste the code, it will be easier this way :)
[08:58:40] <duch_kazatel> bberry you want the thing that was clicked on?
[08:59:01] <bberry> duch_kazatel: i want an array of items that have the handler attached
[08:59:18] <zerobeholder_wor> Ownix: I usually set one rapid timeout loop and use my counter and counter resets to either execute or skip a task when I have a lot going on. Say every ten seconds. But some things I only allow to happen when the counter is even-- so every twenty seconds. This is where you set the mouse enter time then destroy your date on mouse out-- or  the mous
[08:59:18] <zerobeholder_wor> e stays in and the while loop comparing the time runs.
[08:59:24] <BillCriswell> I hope I never come across 90% of the code I see in here in real life.
[08:59:30] <bberry> i could i could just do var myElems = $("#foo, #bar") inside it...
[08:59:37] <duch_kazatel> bberry look at .data("events")
[08:59:42] <bberry> okay
[09:00:03] <BillCriswell> bberry: var $elements = $('#foo,#bar'); $elements.on('click', function(){ $elements.whatever(); });
[09:00:13] <duch_kazatel> bberry are you trying to troubleshoot something?  if so, check out visual event
[09:00:30] <zerobeholder_wor> I was working on a mini game inside of a 'fun' shopping experience. I had to get rid of a lot of timeouts and that was the solution. Been doing it ever since.
[09:00:48] <Ownix> systemfault: why use this over say setInterval?
[09:01:09] <DarsVaeda> Cork: so I tried it but it always runs the code additionally to logging it to the console -> http://pastebin.com/TCFMshG9
[09:01:11] <duch_kazatel> Ownix timers are bad 99% of the time.
[09:01:16] <duch_kazatel> and totally unnecessary.
[09:01:30] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: I have to have a delay before opening my slideout menu
[09:01:34] <duch_kazatel> why?
[09:01:37] <bberry> basically i have written something that operates like a on/off switch.  To turn one thing off, i have to turn the other one on.  Right now im statically defining the other element, but id like to be more flexible, so that the other element is just the one that isnt the one that was clicked
[09:01:47] <zerobeholder_wor> I agree with duch about the 99% of the time. But, timers have their place.
[09:01:59] <duch_kazatel> zerobeholder_wor sure, that's the 1% :)
[09:02:03] <BillCriswell> bberry: .siblings()
[09:02:03] <zerobeholder_wor> Stuff gets skipped, bad things happen.
[09:02:20] <BillCriswell> Maybe.
[09:02:21] <duch_kazatel> bberry why not just use off and on?
[09:02:23] <BillCriswell> I should just go to sleep.
[09:02:33] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell rough night?
[09:03:33] <BillCriswell> Not at all, just my brain was fried by 10am.
[09:03:41] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[09:03:58] <DarsVaeda> Cork: never mind I was in the wrong file -.-
[09:04:11] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: Its more important for when the user mouses out, it should delay a bit and then close. This helps with the odd behavior of animations firing over the top of each other and causing weird and undesirable effects. Especially if the user mouses out and back in really quickly.
[09:04:33] <duch_kazatel> Ownix that's why you should instead rely on events and queueing.
[09:04:49] <BillCriswell> I should be getting way more mileage out of it.
[09:05:02] <janq> Can i ajax i php in a way that it return a response?
[09:05:12] <duch_kazatel> janq wut
[09:05:14] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: I know nothing about events and if you couldnt explain queuing I dont think theres hope for me to understand it
[09:05:23] <duch_kazatel> Ownix events are easy.
[09:05:37] <janq> send data -> stuff happens -> receive answer
[09:06:03] <duch_kazatel> Ownix really, you need to learn about callbacks and .stop() and stuff.
[09:06:17] <BillCriswell> janq: That's how it works completely.

[09:07:45] <apipkin> duch_kazatel: I want to mix and match functionality to a widget. Rather than having one widget for each combination
[09:07:50] <inv3nt0r> This is the sand box: http://ic.athiel.ca/repeat.html
[09:08:00] <inv3nt0r> And here is the live version: http://ic.athiel.ca/training/cpr-course/20140816/?courseID=192
[09:08:14] <inv3nt0r> Note the error on the live version: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'repeatable_fields'
[09:08:33] <duch_kazatel> apipkin you want to conditionally change the plugin based on certain criteria?  because that's still extending it.
[09:08:34] <inv3nt0r> Same markup and scripts are loaded from what I can tell...
[09:08:48] <inv3nt0r> ankurk_: Nice weather up your way today?
[09:08:50] <duch_kazatel> apipkin could you clarify what your use case is?
[09:09:09] <ankurk_> inv3nt0r: nope, cloudy and shit
[09:10:20] <apipkin> duch_kazatel: for instance a DataTable. I would like to build a simple widget that new functionality could be added to it (sort, pagination, resize columns, hide show columns, keyboard nav, etc)
[09:10:39] <duch_kazatel> apipkin so yeah, you want to extend it./
[09:10:40] <BillCriswell> inv3nt0r: Not what's causing the error, but you have a trailing comma in http://ic.athiel.ca/wp-content/themes/initial-care/js/jquery.repeatable-fields.js after sortable options, will ruin your day in IE.
[09:11:09] <BillCriswell> Also in the script that inits it.
[09:11:15] <inv3nt0r> ankurk_: Same here but much warmer than it has been at least!
[09:11:18] <Archer_xda> Ownix : does this help ? http://jsfiddle.net/47Vjw/
[09:11:27] <inv3nt0r> BillCriswell: I will check this...
[09:11:43] <ankurk_> yeah at least
[09:12:09] <inv3nt0r> ankurk_: Legend has it that the frozen lakes are going to affect the weather all spring
[09:12:22] <duch_kazatel> Ownix do you have a fiddle i can poke at real quick?
[09:12:26] <ankurk_> what? seriously? O.o
[09:12:37] <apipkin> duch_kazatel: so for each one you'd have to extend it? if option only wants a paginator, they would have to load dt-page and another wants to sort they would load in dt-sort but if you want sort and pagination you have to load dt-sort-page? (and so on with every other combination)
[09:12:39] <SprkDev> How do I get the text in this textbox using javascript inside here http://jsfiddle.net/WCTfh/
[09:13:03] <SprkDev> I mean inside here <?php echo $_GET['comment'] ?>
[09:13:07] <SprkDev> instead of this <?php echo $_GET['comment'] ?>
[09:13:07] <pagioss>  $('#soundEnabled').val(isEnabled ? 'on' : 'off') <-- will mainly get the value of isEnabled and set it to what?
[09:13:42] <inv3nt0r> BillCriswell: Fixed the trailing commas, but still no good. I guess what I should do is try diabling scripts until I find something conflicting perhaps...
[09:13:45] <duch_kazatel> pagioss check out the conditional operator - if isEnabled is true, it sets the value to "on", if false, to "off"
[09:14:11] <duch_kazatel> apipkin wut?  you're not making any sense.  you started by saying you basically want to extend something without extending it.  now you're talking about something completely different.
[09:14:26] <duch_kazatel> apipkin it sounds like you need to either extend something, or create a new plugin.
[09:14:38] <pagioss> duch_kazatel:  $('#soundEnabled').val(isEnabled ? 'on' : 'off').change() does what?
[09:14:40] <duch_kazatel> apipkin or fork the original plugin and go from there.
[09:14:56] <duch_kazatel> pagioss step through it.  what do you think it does?
[09:14:57] <BillCriswell> inv3nt0r: It's weird because $.fn.repeatable_fields exists when I call it.
[09:15:08] <pagioss> why the change() at the end
[09:15:16] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: it will take me a bit to set one up for you. Give me some time.
[09:15:18] <duch_kazatel> pagioss check out the API docs.
[09:15:26] <duch_kazatel> Ownix nah then don't waste your time.
[09:15:32] <duch_kazatel> thought you might hav e one all ready.
[09:15:48] <Archer_xda> Ownix - check my link.
[09:15:54] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: Archer_xda example works flawlessly
[09:15:59] <inv3nt0r> BillCriswell: I jsut commented out wp_head(); from my wordpress header and it works.
[09:16:10] <inv3nt0r> BillCriswell: Perhaps I am calling jQuery UI twice or some BS
[09:16:15] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* don't use timeouts for animations like that, but do what you want.
[09:16:18] <Archer_xda> setTimeout *is* the way to do it
[09:16:44] <Archer_xda> duch_kazatel - why not use timeouts?
[09:16:59] <duch_kazatel> because you can use queueing and events instead.
[09:17:11] <Archer_xda> But why not?
[09:17:16] <Archer_xda> Not "you can do this instead"?
[09:17:31] <Archer_xda> That's exactly one of the reasons why setTimeout and setInterval exist
[09:17:46] <duch_kazatel> because then folks wind up with bizarro race conditions.
[09:17:57] <Archer_xda> No they don't.  Have you looked at the code?
[09:18:00] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:18:10] <Archer_xda> It's clean as can be.  You cannot do it any cleaner
[09:18:15] <duch_kazatel> sure :)
[09:18:17] <ankurk_> okay I am stuck, I need to get all spans inside a div tag, best way to do it?
[09:18:21] <Archer_xda> Can you make an example for me?
[09:18:32] <inv3nt0r> BillCriswell: I am loading jQuery twice. That will be sure to f_ck it up.
[09:18:38] <duch_kazatel> Archer_xda working on it now.
[09:18:48] <BillCriswell> inv3nt0r: Didn't even catch that.
[09:19:03] <apipkin> duch_kazatel: maybe I can clarify. I want to build a simple widget that can get more functionality added on in any manner. say there are 10 add ons for the widget. that is a lot of combinations you can make. but Extending the base widget for each add on combination doesn't make much sense maybe?
[09:19:14] <bberry> BillCriswell, duch_kazatel: this is what i came up with http://jsfiddle.net/C49Qs/
[09:19:54] <ankurk_> lunch brb
[09:20:19] <inv3nt0r> BillCriswell: Amateur mistake ;) Made by a jQuery amateur no less
[09:20:21] <Ownix> bberry: couldnt you do that with css active selector?
[09:20:30] * inv3nt0r is amateur I mean...
[09:20:40] <pagioss> duch_kazatel: i read the api but didnt understand
[09:20:51] <duch_kazatel> pagioss it triggers the "change" event
[09:21:02] <duch_kazatel> Ownix your nav is using animations, right?
[09:21:04] <SprkDev> Anyone? How I get the text box content is real time? I jsut want to replace $_POST['comment'] with javascript coz I am using ajax
[09:21:12] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:  yes
[09:21:24] <duch_kazatel> all right.
[09:21:29] <pagioss> it triggers the change event to make the ui change ?
[09:21:29] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:
[09:21:32] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/g1eYKSiX
[09:21:33] <bberry> Ownix: probably. i for some reason dont really use the pseudo selectors.
[09:21:36] <Blooomberg> Hi Guys!!
[09:21:40] <bberry> not sure how id change the text though
[09:21:47] <apipkin> duch_kazatel: just like adding in the methods/properties to the prototype of an existing object rather than creating a new object (I don't know if that better worded haha)
[09:21:49] <Blooomberg> I have a problems with the taxtarea value
[09:21:54] <bberry> er, pseudo classes rather
[09:22:07] <BillCriswell> inv3nt0r: Happens.
[09:22:09] <Blooomberg> I changed  it dinamically but doesn't show it
[09:22:23] <Blooomberg> But when I see it in the mozilla console there is
[09:22:24] <Blooomberg> why?
[09:22:27] <bberry> Blooomberg: did you accidentally type "taxtarea" in your html? :P
[09:22:56] <inv3nt0r> BillCriswell: I gotta say for the amount I use it I'm a lot better with it than I was a year ago. jQuery makes Javascript approachable for the common schlub like myself.
[09:22:57] <Blooomberg> no
[09:23:03] <pagioss> duch_kazatel: what is difference between $('#pushEnabled').val(isEnabled ? 'on' : 'off').change() and $('#pushEnabled').val(isEnabled ? 'on' : 'off') they do the same thing for me
[09:23:09] <Blooomberg> textarea*
[09:23:11] <bberry> duch_kazatel, BillCriswell you guys see that fiddle? That look okay-ish to you? or no?
[09:23:20] <duch_kazatel> pagioss one triggers the change event, the other doesn't.
[09:23:38] <pagioss> what is the difference if that is triggered
[09:23:40] <Blooomberg> I have this then of a on change event ::::  $('.text-areapr').html(data['descripcion']).data('per', data['id_key']);
[09:23:50] <Blooomberg> an on*
[09:23:53] <duch_kazatel> pagioss rather, one manually triggers it, likely because they have logic they need to fire that occurs on change, but they want to fire it when things don't change.
[09:27:16] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: youre right though, my events an animations are all out of whack using Archer_xda example
[09:28:08] <Archer_xda> Ownix : Are you stopping animations before they start?  Don't forget that animations will queue so they'll continue even after you stop adding them
[09:28:36] <Ownix> Archer_xda: no this is my code https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/g1eYKSiX
[09:29:04] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/eKDCyVyC
[09:29:07] <BillCriswell> bberry: It seems a little over complicated.
[09:29:30] <Velveeta> sterling?
[09:29:32] <bberry> BillCriswell: actually ichanged it so that all you do is call a makeSwitch function and pass it 2 id's
[09:29:46] <Archer_xda> Ownix: You have this in 2 places... $(element).animate(...
[09:29:49] <BillCriswell> Are passing it two ids needed though?
[09:29:50] <Archer_xda> Change it to $(element).stop().animate(...
[09:29:59] <Ownix> Archer_xda: I should clarify the problem is with the code in the second link I sent you
[09:30:04] <bberry> BillCriswell: not sure how to set it up otherwise :(
[09:30:10] <Archer_xda> ah ok
[09:30:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/LVUmH/
[09:30:32] <duch_kazatel> that's s where i'd start.
[09:30:38] <duch_kazatel> not perfect, but it should illustrate the idea.
[09:30:38] <BillCriswell> bberry: Are they always essentially like.. tabs? Of can they be disabled / enabled across different parts on the dom.
[09:31:11] <Ownix> Archer_xda: if I mouseout and back in while the div is slid out then the slide animation in the second code I sent you seems to run twice
[09:31:26] <Archer_xda> ok - thanks.
[09:31:40] <duch_kazatel> Ownix http://jsfiddle.net/LVUmH/
[09:31:53] <bberry> BillCriswell: yep. but theres always only 2. and unlike tabs, the contents of the disabled one are always displayed.
[09:32:27] <Blooomberg> ??
[09:32:37] <Blooomberg> -_-
[09:32:46] <duch_kazatel> Blooomberg do you have a fiddle or something?
[09:32:50] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: that make sense about stopping ongoing events before starting a new one
[09:32:53] <bberry> BillCriswell: im doing a few things other than what ive shown in the fiddle. i just made that for brevity so that the html/css/javascript wasnt too long to be annoying to read/figure out :P
[09:33:22] <duch_kazatel> Ownix that's one way to approach it.  the other way is to see if there's a currently running animation and queue something up manually, but that may not make sense in your case.
[09:33:23] <bberry> i have to also preload all the values and the enabled/disabled based on what the server has set up
[09:33:39] <duch_kazatel> animations are painful because they're time-driven.  adding more timing to them exacerbates the issue.
[09:33:47] <BillCriswell> bberry: http://jsbin.com/ruleruku/1/edit?html,js,output what about something like this?
[09:34:59] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: yes, I need to stop being ambitious with my projects and follow the K.I.S.S. principle
[09:35:25] <duch_kazatel> Ownix it's not about ambition, it's just about understanding what the toolkit has to offer.
[09:35:41] <Velveeta> that, and ambition
[09:35:53] <dwarder> i have siblings like this  <li class='cl1'><li class='cl1'><li class='cl1'><li class='cl2'><li class='cl1'><li class='cl2'> if i click of on the second 'cl1' i want to select the first one and the one after it (and the one after it if it was cl1) but i don't want to select the last two 'cause they have cl2 in between
[09:35:54] <Ownix> well I know what it can offer, its about the toolkits limitation and my understanding of the tools
[09:36:13] <dwarder> is there a way to do this?
[09:36:26] <bberry> BillCriswell: hmm that might work too. not sure what .eq and .trigger do :/
[09:36:39] <Archer_xda> Ownix: Do you have a link to somewhere we can see this?
[09:36:43] <BillCriswell> I was just choosing one to turn on at random.
[09:36:47] <Velveeta> bberry: he's just using the trigger to preselect one
[09:36:52] <bberry> ah
[09:37:01] <dwarder> anyone? siblings that are one after another?
[09:37:07] <Velveeta> billcriswell: clearly, you're using xkcd's random number generator
[09:37:17] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Didn't realize it till I said that.
[09:37:21] <duch_kazatel> dwarder can you fiddle it?
[09:37:22] <Velveeta> heheheheh
[09:37:27] <Velveeta> reference, for others: http://xkcd.com/221/
[09:37:57] <SprkDev> Anyone? How I get the text box content is real time? I jsut want to replace $_POST['comment'] with javascript coz I am using ajax
[09:38:05] <Archer_xda> Velveeta: Funny, but it's not little bobby tables
[09:38:06] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev look into websockets.
[09:38:10] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: one moment
[09:38:18] <Velveeta> bobby tables is probably my favorite :D
[09:38:26] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev that's assuming i understand your question.
[09:39:21] <SprkDev> THat's seems too complicated for simply getting text input. It's so simple in php. I just do $_GET['text'] that it!
[09:39:29] <SprkDev> isn't there anything like that?
[09:39:45] <Velveeta> sprkdev: it's so simple in php because javascript hands php only exactly what it needs
[09:40:03] <Velveeta> so, yes, there's something like that in javascript also, if you make javascript hand its own function only exactly what it needs
[09:41:00] <Velveeta> if you want the textarea's realtime value, you'll need to grab a handle to it and output its .val(), $('textarea#yourTextarea').val(); // that simple
[09:41:12] <bristleback> in .each(function(k, v) {} ) can I pass v by reference?
[09:41:14] <Velveeta> that's assuming i understand your question
[09:41:28] <Velveeta> bristleback: there's no way to explicitly pass anything by reference in javascript
[09:41:40] <Velveeta> objects are passed by reference natively, but you can't pass, say, a string variable by reference
[09:41:53] <bristleback> ok
[09:41:54] <bristleback> tahnks
[09:42:11] <Velveeta> now if you're iterating over an array of objects, then V will be a reference
[09:42:41] <bristleback> I'm iterating over DOM elements
[09:42:44] <Blooomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/c8NBz/
[09:42:46] <Blooomberg> I have this
[09:43:14] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev huh? anything like what?  you want to realtime update the contents of a text field from the server, right?
[09:43:32] <systemfault> I don’t think he means “realtime”
[09:43:42] <systemfault> More like… ajax/live
[09:43:43] <duch_kazatel> then what does he want?
[09:44:12] <SprkDev> Well kinda, I am using ajax. I just need that field to be able to pass it onto my ajax function which is already working. I had just hardcoded that text field.
[09:44:31] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/5RXgm/ when i click on 'cl1' class i want only cl1 class that are siblings get applied an 'awesome' class
[09:44:31] <systemfault> var lol = myTextarea.val(); $.ajax({data: {lol: lol}} ?
[09:44:35] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: ^
[09:45:03] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: that are near ech other
[09:45:06] <dwarder> each*
[09:45:07] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev pass from where to where?
[09:45:30] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev you have a text field and you want to fetch data from php?  or you want to push it to php?
[09:45:38] <Blooomberg> the problem is I haven't setting task update the texatrea content according DB, but if I set a task reset the inputs , select and textarea without reload the page but already don't load the db values
[09:45:41] <SprkDev> from one file wordpress single.php to script.js
[09:45:44] <inv3nt0r> Thanks for the help everyone, gotta run!
[09:45:52] <duch_kazatel> dwarder so you want the previous and next sibling?
[09:45:53] <SprkDev> I want to push it to a js file as a parameter.
[09:46:07] <duch_kazatel> dwarder or every sibling with that class?
[09:46:12] <SprkDev> doesn't even get to the server yet.
[09:46:43] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev still not making sense.  you mean you want to write out a javascript value on pageload?  the "realtime" part is what makes this confusion.
[09:46:46] <duch_kazatel> *confusing
[09:47:45] <duch_kazatel> dwarder did you see my questions?
[09:47:50] <Ownix> Archer_xda: id have to build a jsfiddle, ill do it when I have time. Some other things need attention right now unfortunately
[09:47:54] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: every sibling with this class but if they are near to each other, i.e. if i click on the first 'cl1' and 'awesome'  class would be applied to the first 4 'cl1' elements 'cause the last two 'cl1' elements are across 'cl2' element
[09:48:07] <dwarder> across*
[09:48:19] <SprkDev> I just have a field where I enter comments for a post. When I click the submit button, an ajax call is made. The parameter is sent to a js file where the xmlhttp stuff is. This then calls another ajax index.php file where the php is done.
[09:48:22] <duch_kazatel> dwarder huh?  it sounds like your markup is really strange.
[09:48:42] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev okay, so you're submitting things via ajax.
[09:48:49] <SprkDev> yes
[09:48:53] <BillCriswell> dwarder: nextUntil ?
[09:48:56] <Velveeta> sprkdev: so, you would just get a handle to your $('textarea#yourId').val(), and pass that as a parameter to your function that makes the ajax call
[09:49:34] <SprkDev> yes :-)
[09:49:52] <duch_kazatel> just drop the textarea from that selector and you're fine ;)
[09:50:08] <Velveeta> right, i just included that to make it more obvious what it was in reference to ;)
[09:50:29] <Velveeta> i guess i could have done $('#yourTextareaId') :D
[09:50:35] <duch_kazatel> fair enough
[09:50:39] <Blooomberg> Velveeta : are you speaking about my script?
[09:50:49] <Velveeta> blooomberg: nope, that was in reference to sprkdev
[09:50:53] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: whats up with the markup?
[09:51:03] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: one goes one after another
[09:51:07] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: as in jsfiddle
[09:51:15] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: i posted earlier
[09:51:24] <duch_kazatel> dwarder check out nextuntil
[09:51:34] <Velveeta> blooomberg: i'm having trouble deciphering your last question about the db load stuff
[09:51:34] <duch_kazatel> dwarder but it's pretty unusual to do stuff like that.
[09:51:44] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: unusual?
[09:51:52] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: in visual jquery world?
[09:51:59] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: what so unusual?
[09:52:21] <Blooomberg> Is single, I have three options in my form, one date picker, one user select and the task
[09:52:22] <duch_kazatel> dwarder without seeing what you're doing, it's hard to suggest an alternative.
[09:52:32] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: i gave you the jsfiddle?
[09:52:32] <Blooomberg> thetask is on textarea
[09:53:00] <duch_kazatel> dwarder that's just an example I'd assume - back up and explain why you're doing it?
[09:53:08] <Blooomberg> so if the date and user already has a task setting previously, automatically it do fill the textarea
[09:53:25] <Blooomberg> If not the textarea is empty
[09:53:30] <Velveeta> i don't know what "a task setting" means
[09:53:54] <Blooomberg> All works perfectly
[09:54:00] <dwarder> ok backing up
[09:54:17] <dwarder> why 'awesome' class in not get added http://jsfiddle.net/5RXgm/
[09:54:23] <duch_kazatel> dwarder lol
[09:54:47] <duch_kazatel> because you're not preventing the default action. start by doing this: http://jsfiddle.net/5RXgm/1/
[09:55:15] <Blooomberg> The problem is if I update a task and without reload the page going to see again the task, doesn't show me but in the mozilla console is. but when I reload the page already works fine
[09:55:21] <Blooomberg> but I loss time reloading the page
[09:55:24] <aton`> hi
[09:55:36] <Archer_xda> dwarder: Also include jQuery ;)
[09:55:51] <duch_kazatel> dwarder here's your solution: http://jsfiddle.net/5RXgm/4/
[09:55:51] <aton`> in .keydown() i get event.keyCode 65 for "a", i was expecting 97 ?
[09:55:52] <Archer_xda> And I assume you only want the clicked one to add the class
[09:56:35] <duch_kazatel> Archer_xda he wanted all siblings up to to get that class.
[09:56:40] <duch_kazatel> *up to cl2
[09:56:48] <Velveeta> blooomberg: what's your native language? i'm wondering if someone in here might be able to better translate what you're trying to do, because i'm having a hard time picking that statement apart
[09:57:07] <Archer_xda> duch_kazatel: Yeah, I see the working link, thanks.  Came late to that party :)
[09:57:10] <duch_kazatel> woah Blooomberg amkes no sense.

[09:57:34] <duch_kazatel> Blooomberg define "task" in simple terms.
[09:58:42] <Velveeta> aton`: i've had similar issues, case doesn't seem important to the keycode parser, but i think it's a browser-specific thing

[09:59:44] <SprkDev> thanks guys
[09:59:46] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: ohh it is prevUntil
[09:59:54] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: thank  you
[09:59:55] <duch_kazatel> Blooomberg still not making sense.
[09:59:58] <duch_kazatel> dwarder sure
[10:00:00] <dwarder> Archer_xda: thanks :)
[10:00:01] <Velveeta> aton`: this might help, looks like 'keypress' is the better event to use for that: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12463344/jquery-how-to-get-keyup-event-capital-and-small-letter-value
[10:00:07] <dwarder> BillCriswell: thank you
[10:00:20] <Velveeta> blooomberg: try posting your question in spanish real quick
[10:00:24] <duch_kazatel> keydown relies on looking at more "raw" events'
[10:00:26] <aton`> Velveeta: thanks
[10:00:34] <duch_kazatel> including modifiers and whatnot.
[10:00:48] <Velveeta> blooomberg: we'll see if anybody can tell us exactly what you're looking to do, and if not, my wife speaks spanish, so if she's at the keyboard, maybe she can
[10:01:33] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta: gettin' creative.
[10:01:47] <Velveeta> yeah, my brain doesn't have a .toEnglish() method :D
[10:01:53] <duch_kazatel> if I asked my wife to help me with something IRC related, she'd look at me like I was retarded.
[10:01:53] <Velveeta> so i'm having to go through a 3rd party api ;)
[10:02:02] <Velveeta> good call
[10:02:02] <duch_kazatel> she's be like "you what?"
[10:02:07] <BillCriswell> No problem, I think.
[10:02:16] <Velveeta> maybe i won't tell her it's from irc, maybe i'll say "i heard this awesome joke in spanish, check it out"
[10:02:24] <Velveeta> and then she can say "i don't get it, what does task mean?"
[10:02:26] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta hahahahahaha
[10:02:30] <Velveeta> and then i'll be like "goddamnit"
[10:02:43] <duch_kazatel> my coworkers give me the funniest looks when I'm laughing at this channel.
[10:02:48] <Velveeta> :D
[10:03:06] <Velveeta> we have similar things with an internal skype conversation we have for all of our FEEs, we crack each other up constantly
[10:03:10] <duch_kazatel> oh shit today is a good day.  lunch with our marketing team, which means beer.  then a movie at work.  then more beer.
[10:03:13] <Velveeta> and many people get weird looks for it :D
[10:03:19] <duch_kazatel> then i go home.
[10:03:26] <Velveeta> i'm going to guess the movie right now
[10:03:35] <duch_kazatel> you're probably wrong.
[10:03:53] <Velveeta> it's this one isn't it: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055946/
[10:04:03] <duch_kazatel> IT IS NOW
[10:04:06] <Velveeta> lol
[10:04:44] <duch_kazatel> gg #jquery
[10:05:17] <Velveeta> funny what "worst movie of <insert random old year, e.g. 1962>" will turn up in a google search
[10:06:18] <duch_kazatel> i just tried that and laughed until i realized I spelled "movie" wrong: http://i.imgur.com/1qkHLgi.png
[10:06:30] <Velveeta> lol
[10:06:48] <Velveeta> speaking of football and movies, i got to see a sneak preview of draft day last week, and it was pretty awesome
[10:06:54] <Velveeta> if you like football and movies
[10:07:34] <duch_kazatel> i'm not much into sports except for maybe rugby
[10:09:28] <Velveeta> well rugby's basically like football, only not as good :)
[10:09:37] * Velveeta peaks out from under his bridge and grins.
[10:10:12] <krambiorix> I want to get the difference in years between 2 dates... This returns 0.08 ... What am i doing wrong ? http://jsfiddle.net/RkPPe/
[10:14:19] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix why not use the javascript Date() object?
[10:14:42] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel,  i do...
[10:14:57] <Velveeta> and what format do you want your difference to be in, here it looks like it's in years
[10:15:13] <bengalo> its / 12 / 365 what is wrong
[10:15:15] <Velveeta> but you're using an extra 12
[10:15:24] <Velveeta> bingalo, bengalo
[10:15:31] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix http://stackoverflow.com/a/3224854/923919
[10:15:37] <bengalo> ding ding
[10:16:20] <Velveeta> krambiorix: there are date libraries out there like momentjs that make this kind of thing a snap
[10:18:39] <krambiorix> Velveeta,  bengalo , it works now , thanks
[10:18:45] <Velveeta> cool
[10:18:52] <duch_kazatel> what was your solution?
[10:20:42] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, removing the /12  but i'm looking into what you posted
[10:21:24] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, what's better with the js Date object?
[10:21:35] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix it handles dates for you :)
[10:21:39] <duch_kazatel> let it do the work.
[10:21:56] <duch_kazatel> dates and times are stupid complicated.
[10:22:16] <bengalo> the month 0-11 thingie
[10:22:17] <bengalo> just why
[10:22:28] <duch_kazatel> arrays :)
[10:22:32] <bengalo> i know why ;)
[10:22:33] <krambiorix> yeah
[10:22:35] <bengalo> still dumb ;)
[10:22:42] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[10:22:46] <duch_kazatel> ;) because ;0
[10:23:04] <krambiorix> damn duch_kazatel you're right
[10:23:12] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, i'll change all my code to use that
[10:23:15] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:23:30] <duch_kazatel> avoid handling dates on your own.  they are straight bullshit.
[10:23:41] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, do you have something like that for amount decimals
[10:23:51] <duch_kazatel> "amount decimals"?
[10:24:20] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, amounts
[10:24:23] <krambiorix> with decimals
[10:24:35] <duch_kazatel> you mean like accurate float arithmetic?
[10:25:02] <duch_kazatel> does the bot have a built-in js parser?  let's find out.
[10:25:04] <krambiorix> i uses euro notation like 1.200,00   and with jquery i have to do a lot of parsing to calculate and have to parse again to show it
[10:25:05] <duch_kazatel> >> 2 + 2
[10:25:06] <Velveeta> the 0-11 array explanation falls apart in some of their other decisions though :D
[10:25:20] <Velveeta> like, the days are 1-indexed, aren't they? years also
[10:25:24] <bengalo> ye
[10:25:44] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix aaah you mean you're talking about localized notation.
[10:25:50] <Archer_xda> Yep - my reason for thinking it's not to do with arrays
[10:25:59] <Velveeta> well, i figured it was due to arrays myself
[10:26:04] <Velveeta> i just don't know why they weren't consistent with it
[10:26:22] <bengalo> maybe cuz its the only consistent one
[10:26:25] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel,  yes
[10:26:28] <Archer_xda> Yes, regardless of the reason, consistency would be good
[10:26:50] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix sadly, not really.  you could scour for a quick lib.
[10:26:56] <Velveeta> is that really how europe does their number places? i knew about the comma for the decimal, but i wasn't aware of the period for their comma-separator
[10:27:06] <duch_kazatel> and todays fun project is going to be reading the Date() source code to see wtf it does.
[10:27:16] <krambiorix> Velveeta, yes it is
[10:27:26] <krambiorix> Velveeta, or whitespaces in stead of dots
[10:27:31] <Velveeta> interesting
[10:27:37] <bengalo> or nothing
[10:27:49] <bengalo> but if you dont want to trouble people reading, yes ;)
[10:28:02] <krambiorix> indeed
[10:28:22] <krambiorix> ok, it's friday, time to drink myself a bottle of wine :)
[10:28:34] <Velveeta> you crawl into that bottle, buddy
[10:28:40] <duch_kazatel> what makes friday special for that?
[10:28:40] <duch_kazatel> :D
[10:28:52] <bengalo> friday is highday
[10:28:57] <Velveeta> because it's wine, instead of whiskey, like tuesdays
[10:29:06] <Archer_xda> Velveeta - depends where in Europe, but mostly yes
[10:29:07] <krambiorix> bengalo, lol
[10:29:21] <krambiorix> Velveeta, no, other days are beer days
[10:29:31] <Velveeta> beer is for breakfast
[10:29:33] <krambiorix> lol
[10:29:43] <bengalo> pussies
[10:29:49] <duch_kazatel> folks slow down - beer every day.  wine for pinkies out.  whiskey for weekends.
[10:29:51] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[10:29:52] <bengalo> real men drink champagne all day
[10:29:58] <duch_kazatel> nah, prosecco
[10:30:02] <bengalo> ah right
[10:30:03] <bengalo> mb
[10:30:20] <krambiorix> real men drink Duvel
[10:30:40] <bengalo> your from nl or be or something like that?
[10:30:43] <bengalo> youre
[10:30:48] <krambiorix> BE
[10:30:50] <krambiorix> :D
[10:30:50] <bengalo> kk ;)
[10:30:51] <duch_kazatel> duvel is all right.
[10:31:35] <krambiorix> ok , see you later, when i'm filled up
[10:31:39] <bengalo> oh god
[10:31:41] <duch_kazatel> enjoy cap't
[10:31:42] <Velveeta> i only drink the finest of boones farm offerings <pinky out>
[10:31:56] <krambiorix> thanks for the help !
[10:32:15] <duch_kazatel> all 'bout that 2 buck chuck
[10:32:20] <duch_kazatel> which is like 2.50 now.
[10:34:23] <Velveeta> i saw this crap at a gas station one day and almost threw up in my mouth: http://www.heatherhillfarms.com/prodimages/chocovine-wine.jpg
[10:34:30] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah javascript isn't fully to blame for that whole "months start at 0" thing
[10:34:45] <Velveeta> lay it on us, prof
[10:34:56] <chuckharmston> Best part of having my name: getting random IRC mentions about Boones Farm and people laughing.
[10:35:30] <duch_kazatel> it's a very old thing.  It's done that way in C, and Java 1.0 did it that way, too.
[10:35:39] <duch_kazatel> C's locatime function does the same thing.
[10:35:50] <duch_kazatel> http://linux.die.net/man/3/localtime
[10:36:01] <duch_kazatel> it's the "nuber of months since January"

[10:36:27] * Velveeta shakes his head.
[10:36:33] <Velveeta> no bueno
[10:39:03] <duch_kazatel> and it'll be that way forever because of backwards compatibility
[10:48:23] <janq> How do i retrieve data in a json format
[10:48:35] <janq> if i set dataType to html i get a string
[10:48:41] <janq> if i set it to json i get nothing
[10:48:46] <janq> http://pastebin.com/Bn6DyRaJ
[10:51:13] <duch_kazatel> are you talking about the return from your server?
[10:51:20] <janq> yes
[10:51:27] <duch_kazatel> is your server setup to return JSON?
[10:51:38] <Archer_xda> Cna you show us exactly what the server returns?
[10:51:55] <duch_kazatel> Archer_xda that won't do any good - the server has to be setup to return json.
[10:53:06] <Archer_xda> it doesn't matter as long as it's in a format that jQuery can understand as json.
[10:53:26] <duch_kazatel> right, but his issue is that he's requestion json and getting nothing back
[10:53:37] <duch_kazatel> that's not a javascript problem, that's a server problem.
[10:53:42] <Archer_xda> Yes, which means it's not parsing it correctly
[10:53:53] <janq> i think i got it
[10:53:56] <duch_kazatel> right, the server isn't.
[10:54:15] <janq> i had a var_dumb in a constructor of mean
[10:54:21] <janq> it was leaking in my json response
[10:54:34] <duch_kazatel> so it was poorly formatted json, not "nothing"
[10:54:55] <Archer_xda> You can return anything you like from the server as long as it fits the expected format.  If you expect html then you don't parse client-side.  If you expect JSON then you do.
[10:55:41] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[10:56:01] <Archer_xda> So the server response is what matters.
[10:56:07] <Archer_xda> Which is why I asked to see it.
[10:56:19] <duch_kazatel> right.  when he said "nothing", I was under the impression there was no return whatsoever.
[10:56:49] <janq> sorry about that
[10:56:55] <duch_kazatel> which lends to the idea that the server was the problem.  if he'd said it was throwing an error, that would have told me it was likely a data problem.
[10:57:00] <duch_kazatel> nah, it's cool, janq
[10:57:28] <duch_kazatel> minor miscommunication.
[10:58:18] * BillCriswell I DONT KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT
[10:58:41] <duch_kazatel> :D
[11:01:13] <duch_kazatel> goddamn some days I just want to play guitar.
[11:01:36] <janq> its a friday
[11:01:38] <janq> go for it :P
[11:02:02] <duch_kazatel> they'd probably let me set my gear up and just go for it.
[11:16:58] <apipkin> Is there a structure for localized strings in jquery?
[11:17:13] <apipkin> (when building widgets)
[11:17:59] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean.  if you mean "does jquery have some way to handle localization", the answer is "it's not built in"
[11:20:08] <apipkin> yeah I didn't know if there was a way to do `messages: { 'en_us': { hello: "Hello", goodbye: "Goodbye" }, 'en_ca': {...}, 'en': {...}}` and have the widget automatically pick up the proper strings based on the locale
[11:21:55] <Toerkeium> Hello guys. Does anyone know an app to build/design jquery themed screens?
[11:21:58] <And1> Hello folks. Could anyone please help with this jquery problem? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22715131/click-on-nav-element-loads-includes-new-content-file-php-into-div-id-include/
[11:22:50] <BillCriswell> Vertical centering is for the devil.
[11:25:28] <apipkin> And1: if you are using jquery, `$('#nav').on('click', 'a', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); $('#include').load($(this).attr('href')); });` Or something along those lines
[11:27:47] <kbouw> How do I use jquery to check if something has been viewed? i.e, notifications
[11:27:59] <kbouw> I've built a notifications tray with notifications working; what i'm trying to achieve is when the notifications are viewed, the default class is removed and another class is added which marks them as "read".
[11:28:23] <kbouw> (please let me know if i've also misphrased what it is I'm trying to do)
[11:28:41] <duch_kazatel> kbouw use .class()
[11:29:12] <kbouw> so instead check to see if the default class is attached to the notification
[11:29:38] <BillCriswell> kbouw: What are you checking?
[11:29:40] <apipkin> kbouw: https://api.jquery.com/hasClass/ ?
[11:29:45] <duch_kazatel> kbouw you can just update the class - .class('read');
[11:29:49] <Velveeta> duch: do you mean .hasClass?
[11:29:58] <Velveeta> er, wait, wat?
[11:29:58] <duch_kazatel> err, yeah
[11:30:01] <duch_kazatel> sorry.
[11:30:09] <BillCriswell> err, yeah, no, you know, yeah
[11:30:11] <Velveeta> ok, i was about to say, i'm not familiar w/ a class method, and i was already headed for the googlez
[11:30:20] <duch_kazatel> out of it today.  http://api.jquery.com/addclass/
[11:30:23] <kbouw> i'm sorry if I'm phrasing my question wrong
[11:30:31] <kbouw> when a user clicks the notification tray in the navbar and the tray shows
[11:30:42] <duch_kazatel> kbouw yeah, you want to add class and remove another.
[11:30:43] <kbouw> the notifications visible should then be marked as "viewed"
[11:31:05] <kbouw> so when the notification tray is opened next time, they are considered "read"
[11:31:06] <duch_kazatel> .addClass() and .removeClass().  you can also do .hasClass() if you want.
[11:31:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I didn't even notice lol
[11:31:17] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Good catch.
[11:31:33] <duch_kazatel> now I'm thinking "wtf would a .class() do?!"
[11:31:35] <kbouw> duch_kazatel would best practice to first check if it .hasClass()
[11:31:46] <kbouw> then modify?
[11:32:08] <duch_kazatel> kbouw i get weird and just do it.
[11:32:14] <duch_kazatel> no need to check first tbh.
[11:32:22] <kbouw> duch_kazatel mmk, thanks
[11:32:28] <BillCriswell> kbouw: Would be a waste of time.
[11:32:36] <duch_kazatel> the method all ready does it for you, basically.
[11:33:38] <BillCriswell> kbouw: Does it matter what class is already on the element? That's the only time you may need to do that.
[11:33:53] <apipkin> Is there not a `replaceClass(old,new)`?
[11:34:18] <BillCriswell> apipkin: .toggleClass('old new') could work.
[11:34:23] <kbouw> @BillCriswell in my notification model i've set the viewed default to none
[11:34:31] <duch_kazatel> eeeh, that will "kind of" work.
[11:34:44] <duch_kazatel> but that toggleclass simply adds if it's not there, and removes if it is.
[11:34:59] <duch_kazatel> the toggle methods have always bothered me.
[11:35:14] <BillCriswell> .removeClass('old').addClass('new')
[11:35:24] <kbouw> @BillCriswell so i feel there needs to be some validation to make sure that the class is not added to notifications whose viewed status is true
[11:36:23] <Velveeta> you can also pass both names to toggleClass() and it'll remove the one(s) present and add the one(s) missing
[11:36:38] <Velveeta> but i'm not sure what the performance looks like doing it that way vs .removeClass().addClass()
[11:36:42] <BillCriswell> apipkin: If old is definitely there and new definitely isn't then toggleClass will be fine.
[11:36:46] <And1> apipkin: Thanks.
[11:38:00] <apipkin> BillCriswell: I wasn't sure if `toggleClass()` was even a valid jquery method :P
[11:38:20] <BillCriswell> apipkin: It is.. I find it useful.
[11:38:21] <Velveeta> i knew it was, but i wasn't sure if it would do both operations in one call like that, so i tested it on the jquery site :D
[11:38:48] <apipkin> Oh wait no I meant replaceClass
[11:38:50] <Velveeta> i know toggleClass is faster if you supply the class state, but not if it's faster than a remove/add operation
[11:40:04] <apipkin> where replaceClass(old, new) would essentially be .removeClass(old).addClass(new)... just added sugar i suppose
[11:41:01] <Velveeta> oooOOOooo, free online: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2014/03/26/announcing-understanding-ecmascript-6
[11:42:07] <BillCriswell> I might have like two cheese burgers tonight.
[11:42:10] <BillCriswell> One of those weeks.
[11:42:25] <ankurk_> I have a weird issue, I am not able to apply unbind a click event, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2983bace7752d671d024
[11:43:32] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Is the event actually on the .btn or is it on a parent of .btn ?
[11:43:57] <ankurk_> It's on the class .btn-delete-punchlist-item
[11:44:02] <ankurk_> Here you go, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bf9e47f0ffe2857d7f52
[11:44:27] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: That's on the document.
[11:44:52] <ankurk_> how would I do that then?
[11:44:59] <BillCriswell> Try like '.btn-info-punchlist:not(.disabled)'
[11:45:00] <ankurk_> that's what I realised now
[11:46:30] <tirengarfio> i have to create a web for a cortain shop, I have thought in showing photos of the cortain textures, but in a dynamic way? im thinking in use a kind of jquery plugin that shows and hide the cortains when hovering the mouse, but what plugin?
[11:46:32] <ankurk_> that worked! :D
[11:46:38] <ankurk_> thanks BillCriswell :D
[11:46:40] <CrowX-> I have a mouseover event in my code. If I want to make some action when the mouse leaves the object, should I define a separate mouseleave event, or is there a way to define that action within the mouseover event?
[11:46:56] <ankurk_> *throws a beer for BillCriswell*
[11:48:06] <CrowX-> oh nvm, I just found out I could append the mouseleave statement with .
[11:48:17] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeeeet
[11:49:17] <ankurk_> Can't wait to call it a day
[11:49:46] <BillCriswell> I was ready to call it a day 5 days ago.
[11:52:12] <duch_kazatel> we're watching goat simulator videos.
[11:52:17] <duch_kazatel> i'm actually excited for it.
[11:52:41] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I saw that the other night... strangly beautiful.
[11:52:45] <BillCriswell> Especially the trailer.
[11:53:15] <duch_kazatel> the new trailer is good, but the original video is great.
[11:53:21] <duch_kazatel> "chase a guy with a park bench"
[11:53:25] <duch_kazatel> "chase a guy with an axe"
[11:53:49] <BillCriswell> Whenever I laugh hysterically at something it's almost certain my girlfriend thinks it's the dumbest thing ever.
[11:54:35] <BillCriswell> This time she may have been right... but it was still hilarious.
[11:57:27] <Valesk> Hey, I'm using owlCarousel as a slider and I need it to stop after 5 slides, there's an afterAction callback method.. but I'm not sure how I would call this when I'm just doing $('#slider').owlCarousel({ some params });
[11:58:56] <Valesk> Do I include it in the same call for owlCarousel?
[12:04:58] <Velveeta> valesk: here you go: http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/#customizing
[12:05:15] <Velveeta> according to that, yes, you should be passing that function in your options object
[12:05:34] <Valesk> Velveeta I actually just found how to call the methods from there. Thank you :)
[12:05:42] <Valesk> Asked the question to early..
[12:10:21] <BillCriswell> I usually figure out the answers to my question right after I type them out.
[12:11:46] <And1> Is there anyone who would help me porting some js-code to jquery?
[12:12:17] <And1> I'm very new to js/jquery, so I hardly don't know what to do to be honest.
[12:12:23] <Velveeta> billcriswell: i usually figure out the answers right after screaming out the question in exasperation
[12:12:41] <Velveeta> i'll be like "what the hell is wrong with this code, you people are idiots, it's not doing--oh.. that's how"
[12:13:35] <Velveeta> and1: we can help with specific questions, but it sounds like you need to do some reading up on some fundamentals to get you started, before trying to convert some code that you don't fully understand over to some other code that you don't fully understand
[12:14:58] <And1> Velveeta: I'm already reading and learning a lot about js, but it will take quite a while until I'm able to do something in js. : /  So I'm asking for help here, as this project has to be finished. : /
[12:16:15] <Velveeta> well we can help with specific questions, so long as it's not like "here.. i need this in jquery format"
[12:16:50] <And1> Unfortunately I think it's like that.
[12:17:09] <And1> I could show you the jsfiddle. Or for anyone who's interested. http://jsfiddle.net/KYjF9/6/
[12:17:47] <Velveeta> so we can walk through this 1 portion at a time...
[12:18:02] <Velveeta> the times when there were only 1 pair of footprints..... that's when i was writing your code for you
[12:18:54] <And1> Sorry I did not understand that?
[12:19:32] <Velveeta> heheh it's a reference to that old 'footprints' bibley thing
[12:20:07] <Velveeta> so yes, we won't do your work for you, but we can definitely go through this thing piece by piece with you and help you learn what you're doing as you do it
[12:20:16] <Velveeta> or at least, that's how i operate personally
[12:20:23] <Velveeta> somebody else may just do it :D
[12:20:30] <And1> Velveeta: That would be great, if you would do this with me.
[12:20:35] <Velveeta> sure
[12:25:30] <visua_> anyone here use Raphael.js at all?
[12:53:09] <farn5w0rth> how do i refresh a single div id with jquery? i have filters at the top of my page that populates a table and clicking through certain cells in that table generates a new table..i want to regenerate the second table on click of “apply filter” or something.. :)?
[12:56:36] <webguy024> is there a function to get all values from an object? instead of looping over the keys?
[12:57:04] <BillCriswell> webguy024: Not in jQuery I don't think.
[12:57:10] <webguy024> thx BillCriswell
[12:57:17] <BillCriswell> Do you have underscore on your page?
[12:57:43] <BillCriswell> Cause that has _.values( objects );
[12:57:52] <BillCriswell> It's still looping... but yeah.
[12:59:43] <webguy024> building an jquery plugin for ember. So trying to keep it light, no underscore.
[13:00:14] <BillCriswell> ok.
[13:10:23] <Genesis_> So I am trying to create something in javascript that will read from a .txt file on the website, and based on the formatting of the .txt file, print things different. Here is an example of the .txt file: http://pastebin.com/nvsBu4GS
[13:10:23] <Genesis_> Does anyone have any suggestions on how to implement this? I am new to jquery/javascript.
[13:11:10] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: .split() and .slice()
[13:11:41] <Genesis_> thank you
[13:19:07] <BillCriswell> Genesis_: Very rough concept: http://jsbin.com/yuhotuko/1/edit?js,output
[13:19:27] <Genesis_> thank you
[13:20:47] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:34:26] <ebernhardson> is there a helper to see if node X is a parent/grandparent/etc. of node Z?  i could write one real quick, but i feel like theres one already i just cant find it
[13:34:49] <ebernhardson> s/helper/method
[13:37:15] <Velveeta> ebernhardson: .find()
[13:37:20] <Velveeta> ?
[13:39:38] <ebernhardson> Velveeta: heh, didn't even look there.  Was thinking it only took selectors, but looks to take an element as the param to find.  will try it
[13:39:53] <ankurk_> or .parent() can work too I guess
[13:39:55] <Velveeta> yepyep, gotta love that versatility
[13:40:11] <Velveeta> yeah, you could use parents() or closest() if you reversed the logic
[13:46:19] <YokoBR> hi guys. i'm using jquery-ui datetimepicker, but i can't figure out the date format to store as timestamp, but be readable for the user.
[14:03:05] <duch_kazatel> gooooood afternoon #jquery
[14:03:24] <ankurk_> the badass duch_kazatel is back :D
[14:03:30] <duch_kazatel> "badass" lmao
[14:03:40] <duch_kazatel> "the ass duch_kazatel is back :D"
[14:03:44] <duch_kazatel> there i fixed that for you :)
[14:03:49] <ankurk_> nah
[14:03:56] <ankurk_> Badass sounds awesome
[14:04:02] <duch_kazatel> how's everybody's day going?
[14:04:51] <ankurk_> about to wrap up :D
[14:04:54] <duch_kazatel> very nice
[14:04:55] <ankurk_> weekend is here
[14:05:49] <duch_kazatel> oddly enough, i'm actually kind of like "whatever" about that sorta stuff.
[14:05:59] <duch_kazatel> i like my joke too much i think.
[14:06:26] <ankurk_> hehehehe
[14:06:38] <duch_kazatel> err, *job
[14:06:51] <alaing> hey duch_kazatel
[14:06:57] <duch_kazatel> whuddup alaing
[14:07:02] <alaing> hows everyone today?
[14:07:13] <ankurk_> you're lucky duch_kazatel
[14:07:24] <duch_kazatel> very.  my employer kicks ass.
[14:07:34] <ankurk_> I hoping that for my first full time gig
[14:07:53] <duch_kazatel> you'll get there.  if not the first one, the second or third.
[14:08:02] <ankurk_> yeah, hopefully
[14:08:17] <ankurk_> I still have lots to learn
[14:08:33] <duch_kazatel> knowing that will get you really far - just don't sell yourself short elswhere.
[14:09:34] <ankurk_> to be honest, I am quite nervous. It scares that I might have to be jobless for any number of days after graduation
[14:09:47] <duch_kazatel> are you looking for a job right now?
[14:09:54] <duch_kazatel> and have you done any interning?
[14:10:15] <ankurk_> I will be done with my internship next month and boom, I am a graduate :D
[14:10:41] <duch_kazatel> awesome.  start tucking away stuff for a portfolio.
[14:10:51] <duch_kazatel> examples of stuff you've done can be invaluable.
[14:12:15] <ankurk_> yep will start soon, this weekend might be
[14:16:03] <duch_kazatel> good
[14:23:45] <alaing> been a long week
[14:23:51] <duch_kazatel> i've had those.
[14:23:51] <alaing> i'm calling it a night
[14:24:36] <alaing> its amazing how a 5 day week can feel like a 10 day week
[14:24:53] <duch_kazatel> i used to work 16 hour night shifts 5 days a week.
[14:25:00] <alaing> ouch
[14:25:03] <alaing> respect
[14:25:14] <duch_kazatel> it was worth it in hindsight.
[14:25:25] <alaing> good money it must of been
[14:25:31] <duch_kazatel> barely.
[14:25:49] <alaing> anyway I gtg
[14:25:50] <CrowX-> I have this menu whose height increases on mouseenter, and some of its items are vertically ordered(i.e. one under another). Can I set something for the distance between those items to increase automatically when the height of the menu increases on mouseenter?
[14:25:53] <alaing> cheers ppl
[14:26:01] <duch_kazatel> enjoy alaing
[14:26:04] <CrowX-> or do I have to manually set margin through jquery inbetween the items?
[14:26:08] <Velveeta> hooray friday work beer!
[14:26:13] <alaing> if i dont see you this weekend have a good one
[14:26:13] <duch_kazatel> woooo!
[14:26:15] <Velveeta> shit.. i didn't beat the rain
[14:26:25] <Velveeta> i'm parked about 150 yards away, with no umbrella
[14:26:36] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- not sure what you mean.
[14:26:44] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- you can use percentages - does that help?
[14:28:07] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, percentage set to what?
[14:28:46] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- without seeing more, it's hard to know exactly what the issue is.
[14:29:28] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, click anywhere on the screen after you load this, then hover over the menu http://www.rachelschmeidler.com/
[14:29:47] <CrowX-> that's made in flash. I want to do that in htm5
[14:29:51] <CrowX-> html5*
[14:31:26] <duch_kazatel> oh you're thinking about it all wrong.
[14:31:48] <CrowX-> enlighten me please
[14:32:12] <Velveeta> great, it's hailing too.. glad i didn't decide to make a run for it
[14:32:18] <Velveeta> ....and that i'm parked in a garage :D
[14:32:24] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel?
[14:33:43] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- "the space between" isn't the issue - you just want to set heights of things.
[14:34:49] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, heights on the things on the right, but isn't it space on the things on the left column?
[14:34:59] <CrowX-> or should I not look at it as columns?
[14:35:39] <duch_kazatel> each thing has columns, but it's all heights
[14:36:01] <duch_kazatel> not "spacing.
[14:36:17] <CrowX-> hmm
[14:36:20] <CrowX-> I think I got it
[14:36:23] <CrowX-> I'll get onto it
[14:36:24] <CrowX-> thanks
[14:37:09] <duch_kazatel> one suggestion - have a parent container that you animate the height of and set it to overflow: hidden; and have a child that's the correct height.
[14:40:31] <Velveeta> ok, sun's out, i'm outta here
[15:12:17] <rainabba> shouldn't $('/join #xml
[15:12:25] <rainabba> Oops :)
[15:15:57] <And1> Could someone please help me with three jslint errors? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22721111/validate-text-inserting-script
[15:35:54] <sunbeam> anyone knows good alternatives to css sprites?
[15:40:12] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, are you there?
[15:47:03] <duch_kazatel> i'm around, CrowX-
[15:47:07] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam not sure what you mean.
[15:48:13] <duch_kazatel> And1 what were the three jslint errors you got?
[15:49:35] <And1> duch_kazatel: Combine this with the previous 'var' statement. two times and Do not use 'new' for side effects.
[15:49:37] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, in the example site from before, the one where I should alter the height. If you notice, when an item of the menu is clicked, all of the other items get resized to 0, except for the one that was clicked, which gets resized to one row's height, and the only visible item is the one you clicked. How could I do this?
[15:49:48] <duch_kazatel> And1 what lines?
[15:49:56] <And1> line 21, line 37, line 40
[15:50:07] <And1> duch_kazatel: ^
[15:50:19] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- set the height of the other two to 0
[15:50:41] <duch_kazatel> and set the current row height to whatever it should be.
[15:50:44] <tw2113> guys! gals! earlier today, i was using jquery and select2?.and i got it to work!
[15:50:57] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, so you suggest I have a separate id for every row?
[15:51:23] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- that might be a good idea.
[15:51:40] <CrowX-> it seems like it would result in a messy code
[15:52:13] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- huh? how?  you can check attributes and go from there.
[15:52:50] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, lots of if cases, and separate scenarios for each click
[15:52:57] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- not at all.
[15:53:02] <duch_kazatel> that's the wrong way to think about it :)
[15:53:28] <duch_kazatel> And1 you know you can combine your fullText and interval var declarations, right?
[15:54:00] <And1> duch_kazatel: No, sorry. : /
[15:54:03] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, there are 3 main rows each of which contains 3 sub-rows
[15:54:06] <duch_kazatel> And1 let me show you.
[15:54:14] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- can you setup a fiddle?
[15:54:23] <duch_kazatel> because you're thinking about it all backwards.
[15:54:57] <duch_kazatel> And1 http://jsfiddle.net/KYjF9/22/
[15:54:58] <And1> duch_kazatel: Sure I'll let you. Thanks! : )
[15:55:01] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, what would be a forward way to go with this?
[15:55:03] <duch_kazatel> chec out lines 14 and 15
[15:55:13] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- abstraction
[15:55:13] <CrowX-> i need just the general idea, I'll deal with the code afterwards
[15:56:09] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- you're thinking about bindings to specific IDs - bind to elements and check IDs instead.
[15:56:49] <And1> duch_kazatel: Great, thanks! : )
[15:57:02] <duch_kazatel> And1 that takes care of grouping vars issue.
[15:57:09] <And1> Now there's only one more error. Line 40. http://jsfiddle.net/KYjF9/23/
[15:57:12] <And1> * warning
[15:57:18] <duch_kazatel> And1 why are you using a constructor there?
[15:58:01] <And1> duch_kazatel: I'm not sure I can really answer this question. : /  I set up that code with a lot of help.
[15:58:21] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* then you need to learn some more.
[15:58:35] <duch_kazatel> And1 you need to go learn about constructors and when they're appropriate.
[15:59:06] <And1> duch_kazatel: I'll do! Though, could you help me for now with this issue, please?
[15:59:21] <duch_kazatel> And1 you need to either not use new, or set its value to something.
[15:59:28] <duch_kazatel> the former is a much better solution in your case.
[16:00:14] <And1> In this case, how would I, duch_kazatel?
[16:00:40] <duch_kazatel> And1 you need to convert your Typing function to not be a constructor.
[16:00:52] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't make sense, then you need to go learn how to do that.
[16:01:26] <And1> I'm new to JS, so I'm on my way of learning... every day a little more.
[16:01:42] <duch_kazatel> congratS?
[16:02:31] <And1> duch_kazatel: Though that doesn't help me right now. Would you please?
[16:02:37] <duch_kazatel> And1 would i please what?
[16:02:44] <duch_kazatel> do you want me to rewrite everything for you?
[16:02:50] <duch_kazatel> did you even see what I've all ready done?
[16:03:15] <duch_kazatel> don't understand what you're asking of me.
[16:03:17] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, so without calling a specific id, if the element is a child of another element which has a few other children, how can I reduce the hight of all the other children except the one the event is called from?
[16:04:15] <And1> duch_kazatel: I'd like to know why a constructor is wrong there and how to do it bette / right.
[16:04:16] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- by comparing the ID values.
[16:04:42] <duch_kazatel> And1 constructors are for creating new objects.  absolutely pointless in your case because you're using it to do that, but not storing its value.
[16:05:06] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, you mean like a for cycle that will check for the id value of every item?
[16:05:11] <And1> duch_kazatel: So could I use var instead?
[16:05:16] <CrowX-> i mean child
[16:05:17] <duch_kazatel> And1 do not do that.
[16:05:25] <duch_kazatel> And1 instead you should you a plain old function. do not use a constructor at all.
[16:05:41] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- or an each, but it'd be something like that.
[16:06:13] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, is there another way of identifying the div from which the event is called without giving every element a separate id?
[16:06:20] <CrowX-> something like 'this'?
[16:06:22] <duch_kazatel> $(this)
[16:06:46] <And1> duch_kazatel: I understand what you mean, but sorry, I don't get how to do it.
[16:07:01] <duch_kazatel> but you need a way to see if you're changing the height on $(this) vs another thing.  using IDs is a much cleaner way than the alternatives.
[16:07:31] <duch_kazatel> And1 here: http://jsfiddle.net/KYjF9/24/
[16:07:34] <duch_kazatel> learn how to make that work.
[16:08:21] <duch_kazatel> And1 protip: this within the Typing function may be completely unnecessary,
[16:09:10] <Velveeta> for a minute, my eyes read that differently...
[16:09:16] <Velveeta> as "Anal protip"
[16:09:24] <duch_kazatel> Well I mean.
[16:09:25] <duch_kazatel> y'know.
[16:09:27] <duch_kazatel> it IS me.
[16:09:29] <duch_kazatel> brb
[16:09:30] <Velveeta> heheheh
[16:09:51] <tw2113> don't got thinking about holes Velveeta
[16:10:15] <Velveeta> the only holes i'm thinkin about are the ones i plug in other people's code!
[16:10:30] <Velveeta> and by code, of course, i mean bodies
[16:10:37] <Velveeta> and by bodies i mean programs
[16:10:48] <tw2113> and by programs you mean cheese
[16:28:49] <macscam1> hello
[16:49:12] <duch_workbeer> well that was different
[17:16:11] <dmarr> can someone help me out with this dropdown logic: http://codepen.io/marr/pen/BCzeG/
[17:16:35] <dmarr> I am trying to only hide the menu when you mouseout to and element that is not the trigger element
[17:27:22] <dmarr> hmm, that seems do do it http://codepen.io/marr/pen/BCzeG/
[17:28:26] <Leidenfrost1> (9:28:09 PM) Leidenfrost1:
[17:28:26] <Leidenfrost1> hello all. I want to add custom jquery functionality to bootstrap widgets. Can anyone give me a hint or source to look on?
[17:28:37] <Leidenfrost1> Oops, bad copypaste sorry.
[17:28:37] <jphase> dmarr: seems like it'd be a good job for css imo ;)
[17:29:44] <Leidenfrost1> But the jquery custom thing still stays.
[17:30:11] <dmarr> yeah, i suppose- jphase. i thought about that too. i want fading out and wouldnt that be a css3 only thing (animate)?
[17:31:14] <jphase> yeah, it'd require transitions
[17:31:35] <jphase> but since IE8 is dead I personally am not too worried about that :D  -  to each his/her own
[17:32:40] <dmarr> jphase maybe ill work on that over the weekend. i hate always having to reinvent dropdowns :)
[17:33:19] <dmarr> but, at least its in a somewhat working state now. still seems to fade out if you dont move quick enough.
[17:36:35] <duch_workbeer> lol "since IE8 is dead"
[17:36:44] <systemfault> IE8 is anything but dead.
[17:36:56] <systemfault> And I’m not saying this because I like it.....
[17:36:56] <duch_workbeer> wish our customers thought that ;)
[17:38:12] <Velveeta> we're having a hard time getting our customers to believe IE7 is dead
[17:38:28] <duch_workbeer> analytics on their shit.
[17:38:59] <systemfault> IE7 is vista… who the F uses that shit OS
[17:39:06] <duch_workbeer> a lot of people.
[17:39:37] <Velveeta> and win7 actually shipped with it for a hot minute
[17:39:42] <Velveeta> er wait no
[17:39:46] <Velveeta> i'm one OS ahead of myself
[17:39:52] <Velveeta> Vista shipped with it for a hot minute
[17:39:58] <Velveeta> XP was the one that it was cutting edge for
[17:40:06] <systemfault> Hmm, true
[17:40:27] <duch_workbeer> also: enterprise clients.
[17:40:43] <duch_workbeer> i worked at a place who had a mission critical internal system that only worked in IE6 for the longest time.
[17:41:12] <Velveeta> also, the customers of any company you work for... doesn't seem to matter where i go... <insert industry name here> customers always seem to be the slowest to upgrade!
[17:41:26] <duch_workbeer> for us, they tend to be OK.
[17:41:35] <Velveeta> which can, of course, be rewritten to read <any industry name here>'s IT department is lazy
[17:41:44] <duch_workbeer> hahahaha
[17:41:47] <visua> Hey anyone know how to tween Translate Transform properties in GSAP?
[17:41:49] <visua> (greensock(
[17:41:54] <tw2113> what did you say about my mother Velveeta ?
[17:42:07] <Velveeta> tw2113: *our* mothers
[17:42:10] <Velveeta> :D
[17:42:18] <tw2113> brother?!?!?!
[17:42:28] <Velveeta> i'm allowed to say it because my mom is IT too, plus, i came from a network admin background, so it's not racist!
[17:42:54] <duch_workbeer> lmao
[17:42:56] <tw2113> my mom isn't an IT person
[17:43:24] <tw2113> i think she got rid of her iphone this week for a dumbphone
[17:43:33] <tw2113> she just wants something that makes phone calls
[17:43:54] <duch_workbeer> that's fine - less tech support for you :)
[17:43:59] <systemfault> lulz...
[17:44:00] <duch_workbeer> my dad's pretty good about shit.
[17:44:09] <systemfault> That’s like trading a car for a horse.
[17:46:03] <tw2113> i'd call it trading a time machine for a regular delorean
[17:46:55] <Velveeta> it's like trading an iphone for a regular phone!
[17:47:10] <tw2113> *points to the exit while looking at Velveeta*

[17:48:00] <jphase> when microsoft bribes their customers with $100 to upgrade from XP and the EOL on IE8 is in 4 days, it's our job to state that IE8 is dead hehe. clients shouldn't determine the direction of web technology imo. I'll still support IE8 if someone wants to pay 76% additional cost though :)
[17:48:32] <jphase> </rant>
[17:48:45] <tw2113> but but?.if you stop supporting XP?.you don't support the ATM CARTEL!
[17:48:50] <jphase> hehe
[17:48:55] <tw2113> you know, those machines that give you free money
[17:49:13] <jphase> nice term tw2113, going to start using ATM cartel from here on out heh
[17:49:45] <Velveeta> wait... jphase... do you work for MS?
[17:50:50] <jphase> hehe no no no, "our job" was not meant to imply anything close to that
[17:51:15] <Velveeta> damn, because EOL on IE8 isn't in 4 days, but EOL on XP is in about 11
[17:51:17] <jphase> the closest thing I have to winblows is a virtualbox running win 7 for IE testing and an occasional bout with diablo 3
[17:51:35] <Velveeta> i got my hopes up for a minute, because our company said when MS EOL's a browser, we can't support it ourselves
[17:51:35] <jphase> April 1st is supposed to be EOL on XP I thought?
[17:51:40] <Velveeta> april 8th
[17:51:42] <jphase> must have my dates wrong
[17:51:43] <jphase> woops
[17:51:48] <jphase> potato potato :D
[17:51:54] <systemfault> By XP…. and fuck you ATM suckers.
[17:51:58] <Velveeta> i was gonna be like "i got a M$ employee saying IE8 is EOL'd in april too! let's stop supporting it!"
[17:52:19] <systemfault> I think they made their money back with a OS they used for about… 14 years now.
[17:52:21] <Velveeta> oh man i would have shit a brick, because then i could have started investigating polymer seriously to convert our widget library over to :D
[17:52:23] <jphase> well, either way... April Fools bitches!!!
[17:52:26] <jphase> :D
[17:52:37] <duch_workbeer> yeah, XP's EOL will be their gift to me.
[17:53:00] <tw2113> assuming people actually upgrade after
[17:53:06] <Velveeta> yeah, XP's EOL doesn't necessarily mean IE7's EOL, since IE7 shipped briefly with vista, but we're using it as enough of an excuse to drop IE7 support anyway
[17:53:18] <systemfault> I hope they don’t and become part of a huge botnet.
[17:53:21] <Velveeta> but we couldn't get the same deal for IE8, we still have something like 60% using it
[17:54:04] <jphase> I just keep sending screenshots of the acid3 test in IE8 to customers and when it comes up as 24% I say "76% additional cost and I'll happily give you an IE8 compatible version"
[17:54:43] <jphase> when jquery and foundation and tons of other libraries/frameworks stop supporting something on their latest versions I don't freeze my work to accommodate unless the client's demographic is literally in the retirement industry
[17:55:04] <tw2113> why do i love the line "Hand-held Hype" ?
[17:55:29] <Leidenfrost1> tw2113: because the pronounciation is awesome.
[17:55:50] <tw2113> hard to argue with that
[17:56:08] <Velveeta> holy shit.. it's friday
[17:56:14] <Velveeta> i just re-remembered that
[17:56:21] <Velveeta> like the first time!
[17:56:38] <tw2113> it was friday all day #truestory
[17:57:28] <tw2113> and there's still more friday to come!
[17:58:36] <Leidenfrost1> guys, I´m using twitter bootstrap as a framework for my website and I´d want to add some more jQuery functionality in it. Can you give me some directions on how to do it? (I have little knowledge of jquery itself)
[17:58:54] <duch_workbeer> "I´d want to add some more jQuery functionality in it."
[17:58:58] <duch_workbeer> like?\
[17:59:29] <Leidenfrost1> Like adding a slideDown event on a progressbar triggered by clicking a button.
[18:00:37] <Leidenfrost1> I can do basic stuff like that, but I don´t know where to add it in the big bootstrap script
[18:06:51] <Velveeta> you wouldn't add it in the bootstrap script itself
[18:07:08] <Velveeta> ideally, you don't want to touch the bootstrap files at all, you want to make your own script files to store that stuff
[18:08:09] <tw2113> i go a step further, i don't even download bootstrap
[18:08:31] <duch_workbeer> that's probably the smartest idea.
[18:08:39] <Velveeta> heheheh
[18:10:11] <tw2113> time to continue work on my food coma?.more orange chicken in my belly!
[18:10:50] <Leidenfrost1> Velveeta: That´s right. But I´m looking for a way to connect my own stuff to bootstrap.
[18:12:29] <Velveeta> bootstrap's pretty heavily event-driven, so you should just be able to tie into and either publish or listen for their events as appropriate
[18:12:33] <macscam1> hey does anyone know why I would see [object, Object] when I console.log() a DOM object obtained through jQuery?
[18:12:47] <macscam1> for more details, see here" http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22725730/rails-how-to-pass-data-from-ruby-to-javascript
[18:12:57] <Velveeta> macscam1: because the jquery wrapped object is what you're logging, not the dom element itself
[18:13:09] <Velveeta> try console.log(yourJqueryObject.get())
[18:13:14] <macscam1> Velveeta - ok, I thought that might be the case .........
[18:13:16] <macscam1> thanks!
[18:13:18] <Velveeta> that'll return just the raw dom nodes
[18:13:24] <macscam1> I  just tried .content()
[22:17:14] <tcpman> Hey
