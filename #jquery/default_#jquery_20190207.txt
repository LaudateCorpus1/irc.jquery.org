[09:12:50] <znf> I have a $('select').change() function for a specific field that triggers some specific actions. How do I trigger the $.change() when I do $.val() on the field?
[09:13:15] <znf> Oh, excuse me. Should have googled.
[09:39:34] <bestdesign> hi
[09:41:08] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/rvd87jes/
[09:41:11] <bestdesign> what i do bad there?
[09:41:23] <bestdesign> try update text on focus
[09:41:29] <bestdesign> what fade
[09:42:13] <thykka> bestdesign, look at the error message?
[09:42:41] <bestdesign> oh
[09:42:44] <bestdesign> console
[09:44:51] <thykka> looks like your selectors don't match your HTML, and you're also trying to access a variable that isn't defined
[09:45:05] <thykka> also, your html contains an
[09:45:11] <thykka> id which starts with '#'
[09:45:15] <thykka> that's not right
[09:46:13] <bestdesign> ph yes sorry just fix
[09:48:18] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/k0g18edw/
[09:48:26] <bestdesign> so not really want to change the text?
[09:48:54] <bestdesign> with fadeTo
[09:49:12] <thykka> tbh, I'm not sure what your aim is here, even
[09:49:18] <bestdesign> a moment
[09:57:25] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/k0g18edw/2/ So i try to make a button when click on it focus the input and if is not filled then write at 'basic text'
[09:58:56] <thykka> okay, well, what are you attempting at here? var subscribe = $('input_deltaone_subscribe:input');
[09:59:52] <thykka> i get that it's supposed to refer to the input's ID, but the valid selector for that is $('#input_deltaone_subscribe')
[09:59:53] <bestdesign> is the name with id for input to select
[10:00:01] <thykka> dunno where you got :input from
[10:00:19] <bestdesign> well as I read is a selector with jQuery for input elements
[10:00:32] <bestdesign> like :button etc
[10:00:35] <bestdesign> :file
[10:00:48] <bestdesign> or :submit for buttons with submit
[10:01:03] <bestdesign> type submit
[10:01:16] <bestdesign> html side
[10:01:36] <thykka> right, well, in this case you're selecting with an ID, and IDs are (=should be) always unique
[10:01:44] <thykka> so any additional qualifiers are redundant
[10:01:53] <bestdesign> so you mean is no need there?
[10:02:11] <thykka> yes, this is the only element with id="input_deltaone_subscribe", right?
[10:02:25] <bestdesign> yes
[10:02:35] <bestdesign> var subscribe = $('input_deltaone_subscribe');
[10:02:37] <bestdesign> i update
[10:02:45] <thykka> nope, ID selectors need a # in front
[10:02:49] <bestdesign> ah
[10:02:52] <bestdesign> really
[10:03:19] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/k0g18edw/4/
[10:03:24] <bestdesign> :)))
[10:03:34] <bestdesign> any idea how check js file for bugs? any tools?
[10:04:24] <thykka> the console will show an error for JavaScript syntax -related bugs
[10:04:51] <thykka> then there are linters which help with formatting code properly
[10:05:11] <thykka> and then you should probably be writing unit tests to ensure your logic works as intended
[10:05:37] <bestdesign> unit test? ah cool
[10:05:58] <thykka> when everything else fails, you can always use the step debugger to inspect what is happening at each point of your code
[10:07:34] <bestdesign> step bugger? is with chrome?
[10:07:52] <thykka> yes, in developer tools, if you look in the Sources tab
[10:08:10] <thykka> find your javascript code there, and click the line number to set a breakpoint
[10:08:32] <thykka> whenever that line is processed, the browser will pause everything and you can step through each line of the code
[10:08:46] <bestdesign> oh ty i will se
[10:08:47] <bestdesign> see
[10:17:41] <bestdesign> thykka may i ask still?
[12:11:41] <foo> I'm seeing Accept-Encoding change between requests - same browser, same server, different mp3 on an html5 audio element... sometimes br shows up in header, sometimes it doesn't. I see it on one server but can't reproduce on http://httpbin.org/headers ... so weird. Can anyone explain why this happens?
[12:15:47] <shoky> "br shows up in header" ?
[12:16:32] <foo> shoky: yes,  "Accept-Encoding": "br, gzip, deflate" is what I see most often but out of 10 tabs open and refreshing them all at the same time, sometimes I see  "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate" ... safari incognito. I cannot explain why this happens
[12:18:27] <foo> shoky: are you as baffled with this as I am?
[12:23:31] <taplar> "A compression format using the Brotli algorithm."  funky
[12:24:59] <foo> taplar: What I don't get is why it's *inconsistent* - I suspect it either shows up or it doesn't
[12:25:11] <foo> taplar: if anything, I know it's only available via HTTPS
[12:27:56] <taplar> Is this on the response headers from the server?
[12:29:17] <foo> taplar: I believe it's client-side. although, I don't see it here: http://httpbin.org/headers
[12:30:14] <taplar> so the request headers?  is this an ajax request?
[12:30:25] <taplar> i'm trying to determine how this is jQuery related
[12:32:17] <foo> taplar: I do some ajax requests on the page, I'm not sure if that factors into this. Hmm, since I'm capturing these headers in the actual browser request and not AJAX I don't know if AJAX POSTs can influence this? Hmmm
[12:33:31] <taplar> if that header is on a request that is a form submit, and not an ajax request, then that is outside javascript
[12:35:06] <foo> taplar: I see. In that case, I'm curious if anyone here has any general understanding of this nature of web dev (since I've been at this for a couple days and no one seems to know)
[12:35:47] <taplar> #web would be more on topic for a generalized question such as that
[12:37:40] <taplar> you might also read up on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding and see if you can learn more about how the content negotation process takes place to determine those values
[12:40:49] <foo> taplar: I have, although I can look again I suppose. I'm still not seeing anything that says "and this is why this would change between requests on the same browser same server" etc
[12:42:57] <shoky> foo: why does it matter to you?
[12:43:34] <foo> shoky: eh, this is a good question. I can let it go but my curiosity is kicking me. I can only imagine nginx plays a role in not allow br in some cases under certain load.
[12:43:37] <shoky> browsers do lots of weird stuff
[12:44:30] <foo> shoky: I was using it in a fingerprint hash. I saw the hash change between requests which made no sense. Short answer: I'm going to remove this and stick to HTTP headers User-Agent, Accept-Language, Cache-Control, and Dnt headers
[12:46:13] <shoky> a fingerprint hash for what purpose?
[12:47:35] <shoky> does your nginx support br ?
[12:47:36] <foo> shoky: we have an audio player and it's important to resume audio sessions where they left off. I was setting it up with a fallback to a browser hash in the event cookies were lost/cleared or such.
[12:48:04] <foo> shoky: I haven't explicitly defined that but I did see that... I could try to enable it and see if it creates for a stable and reliable hash
[12:48:16] <foo> actually, I'll do that for kicks (despite it being suggested this is purely client side)
[12:48:41] <shoky> client side can make decisions based on previous server responses
[12:48:56] <foo> shoky: interesting, now that's a nugget here I didn't realize. thank you for sharing!
[15:24:21] <gambl0re> hello?
[15:34:42] <taplar> g'd evening
[15:39:25] <gambl0re> hey tap, how's going?
[15:40:53] <taplar> fairly well, you?
[15:46:23] <gambl0re> im doing good
[15:46:47] <gambl0re> how does jquery handle prototype chaining?
[15:47:37] <bestdesign1> no idea
[15:48:42] <taplar> what do you mean?
[15:48:49] <robertmaxrees> https://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20190206.log.html#t19:24:44 (shrug)
[15:49:11] <taplar> I saw they fixed the logs finally.  Awesomesauce
[15:49:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:49:29] <taplar> Need to go close my issue
[15:52:39] <gambl0re> robertmaxrees, you're truly amazing. you know that?
[15:52:45] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:52:46] <robertmaxrees> kay
[15:52:48] <gambl0re> first class troll at it's finest
[15:52:56] <gambl0re> you deserve a medal
[15:52:58] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:53:11] <gambl0re> just be quiet. thanks
[15:53:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:53:22] <robertmaxrees> i answered your question yesterday.
[15:53:27] <robertmaxrees> what's not clear?
[15:53:37] <taplar> not a great idea to tell a room mod to be quite, btw
[15:53:38] <gambl0re> *sigh
[15:53:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:53:51] <gambl0re> so ban me then
[15:53:56] <robertmaxrees> okioe
[15:53:58] <robertmaxrees> *okie
[15:53:58] <taplar> you can /ignore him if you want
[15:54:27] <robertmaxrees> ah wait
[15:54:37] <taplar> banner's remorse?
[15:54:50] <robertmaxrees> (Shrug) he asked for a ban lol
[15:58:13] <gunther> have fun buddy. i wish you all the best of luck in life
[15:59:50] <robertmaxrees> real tempted to turn +r back on.
[16:00:01] <taplar> ah, is that why the logging is working again?
[16:00:06] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[16:00:08] <taplar> lol
[16:00:41] <robertmaxrees> yep that'd do it.  welp.
[17:56:00] <badcss> Hi all. Does anyone know how I can replace multiple characters inside a string?
[17:56:34] <taplar> Can you elaborate on what you're trying to replace?
[17:56:41] <badcss> I got some products that have multiple slashes and the word wrap doesn't break because of the slash
[17:57:04] <badcss> let me paste my code into a jsfiddle. I've got it working but only on the first slash
[17:57:29] <badcss> https://jsfiddle.net/j0c9z786/
[17:57:56] <badcss> This code replaces the first slash with a slash followed by a hidden space character which will fix the word wrap issue
[17:58:47] <badcss> but I need it to replace every slash
[17:59:05] <taplar> yeah, there's a /g version of a regex i'm trying to get the pattern to work for
[17:59:37] <badcss> Awesome, thank you
[18:01:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/nfjgh2c3/
[18:07:06] <badcss> Great!!
[18:07:09] <badcss> Thank you very much
[19:36:46] <djbozzz> hey all, any articles or recommendations for organizing jQuery code? I've tried to consolidate all my event listeners into a single class that calls dependencies injected in and passes along the jQuery event object. But, still feels tightly coupled.
[19:37:04] <robertmaxrees> "into a single class"?
[19:37:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd change that into a more component-based structure.
[19:38:59] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: Yeah so I have a single ES6 class that I instantiate and each function can be passed multiple functions that it will call
[19:39:40] <E_be_be> hey guys, let's say I have 10 images in a div, random 5 of them are visible like this https://jsfiddle.net/hbnz249d/
[19:39:51] <robertmaxrees> djbozzz that's weird.
[19:40:00] <E_be_be> what would be the cleanest way to shuffle 5 visible items without any lags and flickers?
[19:40:03] <robertmaxrees> djbozzz i'd instead break things out so you have a class or w/e per component.
[19:40:30] <djbozzz> I read an article awhile back that suggested using event sourcing/pub sub as a way to decouple... though felt like it added extra complexity and management which outweighed the effect of the loose coupling
[19:40:54] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: so single responsibility principle type deal?
[19:40:59] <robertmaxrees> i've worked with pub/sub - it's got its places.  but can be oveuserd and get ugly real quick.
[19:41:21] <djbozzz> Thats how I felt when implementing in JS
[19:41:32] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, single responsibility.  if you notice you're repeating the same logic in multiple places, abstract it into a util and share it.
[19:41:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?  implementing in js vs...?
[19:42:40] <djbozzz> I've done backend dev for the past few years(C# and Go) ... haven't done much Javascript(or any dynamically typed language) so just organization thought process is a bit different to me(and pub sub with microservices)
[19:42:52] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[19:43:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can borrow a lot of concepts, really.
[19:44:14] <djbozzz> Yeah I really like Reacts single state paradigm -- but trying to use some structure I've picked up in Go
[19:44:51] <E_be_be> bumping my question :D
[19:45:37] <robertmaxrees> E_be_be can you be more specific?  what have you tried?
[19:45:49] <djbozzz> E_be_be: Like a carousel?
[19:46:13] <E_be_be> djbozzz exactly
[19:46:27] <robertmaxrees> why not just use a carousel then?
[19:47:03] <djbozzz> Isn't the best way to implement a carousel keeping everything in the dom and just moving it out of the window and back in -- rather than hiding / displaying? robertmaxrees:
[19:47:25] <E_be_be> thats why I wanted to ask first
[19:47:49] <robertmaxrees> i mean, the best thing is to never use carousels.
[19:48:07] <robertmaxrees> but otherwise, just use one of the dozens of available libs for carousels and call it a day (shrug)
[19:48:24] <E_be_be> I could pick 5 random items with specific class and set display to block and opacity to 1 while hiding the other 5
[19:48:24] <djbozzz> lol
[19:48:37] <robertmaxrees> djbozzz i'm dead serious heh
[19:48:56] <robertmaxrees> E_be_be why not just use a preexisting library for this??
[19:48:56] <djbozzz> Oh I know ha
[19:49:30] <E_be_be> robertmaxrees can't find one tbh
[19:49:38] <robertmaxrees> really?
[19:49:59] <djbozzz> http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[19:50:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm not meaning to be a jerk, genuinely just curious: did you try searching google?
[19:50:40] <E_be_be> of course, I think we've been thinking about different types of carousel lol
[19:50:54] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:51:03] <robertmaxrees> so do you or don't you want a carousel???
[19:51:09] <E_be_be> imagine a row of 5 images, each 3 seconds they shuffle so 5 of 10 fades out
[19:51:21] <E_be_be> and different, random 5 appear in their place
[19:51:22] <robertmaxrees> "shuffle" is ambiguous heh
[19:51:23] <E_be_be> lol
[19:51:35] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want a carousel then :)
[19:51:41] <djbozzz> So, not necessarily a carousel but a gallery that hides & shows images
[19:51:54] <robertmaxrees> and backing way, way up - you know that's going to be an accessibility nightmare, yeah?
[19:51:54] <djbozzz> preferably at random*
[19:52:05] <robertmaxrees> and users generally ignore content like that on pages.
[19:52:20] <E_be_be> ikr, I've been told to do this so...
[19:52:21] <E_be_be> :D
[19:52:29] <robertmaxrees> :/
[19:52:36] <robertmaxrees> really hate places that don't allow dev input.
[19:52:37] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[19:52:44] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: I would assume 90% of his users probably dont need accessibility support?
[19:52:55] <robertmaxrees> djbozzz bad assumption to make.
[19:52:56] <djbozzz> Granted I'm not a frontend dev **
[19:53:17] <djbozzz> By accessibility you are talking about users with certain disabilities, right?
[19:53:24] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:53:27] <robertmaxrees> but also
[19:53:32] <E_be_be> I was just thinking if theres a lib for that already
[19:53:39] <E_be_be> that I can't find obviously lol
[19:53:43] <robertmaxrees> when you move stuff around on pages like this, users go "blind".
[19:53:58] <robertmaxrees> ie they no longer see that content.  because they're trained to ignore it.
[19:54:21] <robertmaxrees> E_be_be i haven't seen anything like that specifically, but it'd be easy enough to implement.
[19:54:32] <robertmaxrees> your basic overview seems about right.
[19:54:41] <robertmaxrees> don't worry about perf issues until you have them.
[19:55:48] <E_be_be> well, thanks for help, hopefuly it'll work smoothly and wont be annoying af
[19:56:02] <robertmaxrees> why are you assuming you'll have performance issues??
[19:56:03] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: Do you build with accessibility in mind from the beginning? I feel like most "starter" apps dont -- given that only 3% of the world is visually impaired
[19:56:20] <robertmaxrees> djbozzz so you're making big assumpotions there.
[19:56:40] <robertmaxrees> the biggest being that accessibility is only for people with visual impairments :)
[19:56:53] <robertmaxrees> and all apps should, generally, try to be accessible to everyone.
[19:57:21] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: Thats true, though  Ithought we were just discussing visual impairment
[19:57:43] <robertmaxrees> dunno where you got that impression :)
[19:58:04] <djbozzz> 	when you move stuff around on pages like this, users go "blind".
[19:58:11] <robertmaxrees> that was a separate issue.
[19:58:13] <djbozzz> Weird tried to quote... but yeah
[19:58:21] <djbozzz> Gotcha
[19:58:30] <robertmaxrees> normal end users are basically trained to ignore content that moves on its own.
[19:58:37] <robertmaxrees> since it looks like advertising.
[19:58:50] <robertmaxrees> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/ for some good information
[19:59:07] <djbozzz> Huh interesting, never knew
[19:59:08] <robertmaxrees> carousels *CAN* be done effectively, but 9/10 they're bad.
[20:03:42] <djbozzz> robertmaxrees: Getting back to the component based design paradigm -- how do you handle one component depending on another. Example: one component loads some part of the DOM of an external source another component loads some DOM from an external source and might change part of the 1st component. Do you just separate out the dually used DOM element into another component and give it as a dependency to the other two(tight coupling)?
[20:04:20] <robertmaxrees> so in my current app, we use a parent/child view relationship.
[20:04:39] <robertmaxrees> if a view relies on another, then yes, we explicitly include it.
[20:05:21] <djbozzz> But, aren't you just tightly coupling views together? I'm assuming you separate out your business logic & data fetching(repository) into other layers?
[20:06:00] <robertmaxrees> we currently use backbone, so yes, we try to separate out the data fetching portion as appropriate.
[20:06:24] <robertmaxrees> but if you abstract things correctly, that coupling really isn't a problem.
[20:06:51] <robertmaxrees> since you're not really coupling anything togeher other than the init of the child component.
[20:07:17] <djbozzz> I gotcha right on
[20:07:18] <robertmaxrees> pretty much every client-side js framework does something like this.
[20:07:54] <robertmaxrees> though i will mention 2 things to beware of.
[20:08:03] <robertmaxrees> 1: make sure you're using a sane bundler like webpack.
[20:08:06] <djbozzz> is backbone just a view library or a client side framework?
[20:08:14] <djbozzz> I am using webpack and babel :D
[20:08:19] <robertmaxrees> 2: don't just use jquery alone when you get to this level of complexity.
[20:08:45] <robertmaxrees> backbone an MV* - it has some interesting ideas and is relatively simple.
[20:08:49] <djbozzz> What do you normally complement it with?
[20:08:58] <djbozzz> Right on
[20:09:01] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:09:10] <robertmaxrees> wrong direction to think in :)
[20:09:28] <robertmaxrees> jquery's just for abstracting the DOM - anything more than that and you want a framework.
[20:09:39] <djbozzz> Ah okay
[20:09:41] <robertmaxrees> so you'd complement backbone with jquery, for instance.
[20:09:51] <robertmaxrees> though if you use something like react, you wouldn't use jquery at all.
[20:10:33] <djbozzz> If it already handles views, why would I want to use jQuery with Backbone? Coming from minor React experience -- being a view / ui library you wouldnt use jQuery at all since React handles DOM updates, right?
[20:10:46] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating 'view' with 'dom'
[20:11:11] <robertmaxrees> backbone doesn't provide a built-in way to automatically update the page.
[20:11:11] <djbozzz> Not necessarily conflating -- but more confused ha
[20:11:22] <robertmaxrees> you do that part yourself.
[20:11:24] <djbozzz> Its just templating then?
[20:11:27] <djbozzz> than*
[20:11:30] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't do templating either.
[20:11:44] <robertmaxrees> it's not all that opinionated.
[20:11:49] <robertmaxrees> it just provides some structure.
[20:12:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out the docs to learn more.
[20:12:27] <robertmaxrees> keep in mind that MVC doesn't really translate to the frontend dev world.  the paradigm gets kind of shoehorned in.
[20:12:44] <robertmaxrees> but it doesn't really make sense since javascript doesn't support classical OO all that well.
[20:12:57] <djbozzz> In all honesty.... *frontend routers* took way to long for me to understand... ha
[20:13:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:13:32] <djbozzz> Life goes on.
[22:01:30] <CuirPork> Any idea why my label transition jumps on focus, but not on blur? https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/bzavWw?editors=1111
