[00:01:55] <Kartagis> I still don't have the answer to my original problem :S
[00:04:52] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/z3u0Lkhj/9/
[00:06:15] <Kartagis> Cork: they are still concatenated
[00:06:40] <Cork> where is the concatination?
[00:06:49] <Cork> i don't see any here
[00:07:11] <litropy> Okay ... first, when I $.ajax { dataType: 'jsonp', success: (function( data ) {})}, is data already a parsed JSON object?
[00:07:22] <Cork> litropy: yes
[00:07:53] <litropy> Cork, thx. Next, how the heck do I pull a value from a key that's nested to smithereens?
[00:08:09] <Cork> litropy: you would have to know where it is nested
[00:08:29] <Cork> or recursibly loop the entire object
[00:09:13] <litropy> Cork, so it's not as easy as $(data).find('myuniquekey')?
[00:09:48] <Cork> that would be for dom elements
[00:09:49] <Cork> not json
[00:10:04] <Cork> and no there is no api to search in objects
[00:10:09] <litropy> Cork, I feared such.
[00:10:23] <Cork> litropy: why is this such a problem?
[00:10:48] <litropy> Cork, it's really not. I'm just failing at being lazy.
[00:10:55] <Cork> heh
[00:11:10] <washeul> Cork could u pls take a look in this http://jsfiddle.net/ca6jdy9s/1/
[00:11:11] <litropy> now reading: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11922383/access-process-nested-objects-arrays-or-json
[00:11:57] <Cork> washeul: you are binding the click handler on existing elements
[00:12:03] <Cork> not as a delegated event listener
[00:12:13] <Cork> so when you add new fields they won't have a listener
[00:12:29] <Cork> change .click to on('click', 'selector'
[00:12:34] <Cork> and bind it on a static parent
[00:12:40] <Kartagis> Cork: http://imagizer.imageshack.com/img674/9627/Snkfcb.png 300*2000 shouldn't make 6000000000
[00:13:04] <Kartagis> it's 600000
[00:13:28] <Kartagis> >> 60000000000/600000
[00:13:37] <Kartagis> >> eval(60000000000/600000)
[00:13:50] <Kartagis> >> Math.eval(60000000000/600000)
[00:13:53] <Kartagis> bah
[00:14:21] <Kartagis> 10000
[00:14:37] <Kartagis> should I always divide that by 10000?
[00:15:30] <washeul> i changed that line to $('input[type="text"]').on('click', function(){
[00:15:41] <washeul> its still not working

[00:22:22] <Mega> ^_^ hi guys!! could someone tell me please, is there an "analog" of .keypress() but for .keyup()? i mean.. is there any listener like .keyup() but which do not catpure (ctrl,alt,shift etc) keys?
[00:23:40] <wa5ted> Mega:  im pretty sure when a keydown, keyup event is fired, it also passes into the returned object whether modifier keys are true or false
[00:24:10] <Cork> Kartagis: 100 * 1000 * 200 = 20000000; (100 + 100 + 100) * 20000000 = 6000000000
[00:24:22] <Cork> Kartagis: the result matches the math
[00:24:53] <Cork> Kartagis: not sure if you meant for both the > 40 and > 80 to run at the same time
[00:24:59] <Cork> but that is what your code does
[00:25:27] <Kartagis> Cork: hrm, I thought 40 would be skipped if it hit 80
[00:25:35] <Cork> then you need an else in there :)
[00:25:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/z3u0Lkhj/10/
[00:38:45] <Mega> wa5ted: could you look at my 4 lines of code please? what's i'm doing wrong? http://privatepaste.com/b5f582da78  when i press alt,shift,ctrl, that "further code" works anyway :(
[00:39:02] <Mega> s/what's/what
[00:39:08] <wa5ted> Mega: simple, run a console.log on the event and read the readout in the console
[00:42:42] <Mega> wa5ted: usual it's the right way, i know, but now i can't figure out, where exactly i have to look? :'(
[00:43:12] <wa5ted> run the console.log
[00:43:22] <wa5ted> and see the event and if the modifier keys are false
[01:01:48] <Xethron> Hello. I have a few image tags with a class of iviewer, and I'm trying to do something like this: $(".iviewer").iviewer({ src: this.src });
[01:01:55] <Xethron> But I can't seem to get it to work
[01:03:28] <Xethron> The only other option is to explicitly state the url for every image and then generate a unique container for everyone
[01:03:33] <Xethron> But that seems wrong
[01:05:44] <acidjazz> man i gotthe craziest jquerybug
[01:05:47] <acidjazz> console.log(State.params);
[01:05:52] <acidjazz> gives me

[01:05:55] <acidjazz> right
[01:06:22] <acidjazz> console.log($.param(State.params));
[01:06:25] <acidjazz> gives me undefined
[01:06:26] <acidjazz> wtfff
[01:09:01] <acidjazz> i have no idea why its doing this
[01:10:11] <acidjazz> who can explain this

[01:10:14] <acidjazz> its crazy
[01:10:33] <acidjazz> davidvanleeuwen: can u explain this http://i.imgur.com/RHCJuso.png
[01:13:35] <davidvanleeuwen> acidjazz, are you mentioning random people? :P
[01:13:42] <davidvanleeuwen> check out the docs
[01:13:46] <davidvanleeuwen> you should use an object, not an array
[01:14:31] <davidvanleeuwen> oh wait, you can use an array according the docs
[01:15:29] <acidjazz> yea but im not trying to do .push or anything
[01:15:38] <acidjazz> im setting it w/ State.params[key] = value
[01:16:27] <davidvanleeuwen> dont think you can use an associative array
[01:16:33] <acidjazz> this is javascript
[01:16:36] <acidjazz> its objects an arrays right
[01:16:43] <acidjazz> how is that becoming an associative array
[01:16:51] <davidvanleeuwen> doesnt loop through your keys
[01:17:30] <acidjazz> ok the actual JS that does htis is this https://gist.github.com/acidjazz/3e3c1257509993195e78
[01:17:48] <acidjazz> State.param('sort', 'tstamp');
[01:18:03] <acidjazz> how is that not right

[02:58:00] <washeul> i want to identify that div to do draggable operation
[02:59:31] <washeul> though i can achive it like --$('#cardplaceholder').on('click', 'input[type="text "]',function(){  under this i find the parent div of the input text & then i can do the drag
[02:59:47] <washeul> but i want a separate solution
[02:59:54] <HowardwLo> sahbeewah: thanks
[03:00:20] <washeul> so that the user dont have to click in the test box to derg his parent div

[03:59:31] <gaius65> The url http://boltzmann.studioq.at/english.html returns status code 303 (redirect), but using jQuery.ajax it returns status code 204. Why?
[04:00:08] <sahbeewah> Kartagis: what does the .val() return? You’re probably trimming valuable timezone information
[04:02:51] <Kartagis> 2014-09-15 I get this
[04:02:59] <Uhkis> interesting, toJSON() changes the timezone
[04:03:17] <Kartagis> as does toISOString()
[04:04:54] <droid909> why can't i animate this: $('#my_div').animate({'background-color': '#fff'});  ?
[04:05:04] <droid909> can i do it in another way?
[04:06:39] <workerbeetwo> Hi. What is the shortest way to have a div show some elements only while hovering that comeplete div ?
[04:09:24] <sahbeewah> Kartagis: toJSON/toISOString normalizes the date to iso8601
[04:14:33] <HowardwLo> when do you use switch statements and when do you jstu stick with if’s ?
[04:15:22] <Kartagis> Date.prototype.toGMTString() <--- how do I use this?
[04:17:07] <Kartagis> hrm
[04:17:43] <sahbeewah> are you sure the .val() returns 2014-09-15? seems strange the plugin UI would be showing local time whilst calling val on it would be showing utc
[04:17:54] <sahbeewah> anyway, use .toLocaleString instead
[04:17:57] <Kartagis> the funny thing is, even if the textfield contains today's date, it is interpreted as yesterday
[04:18:21] <sahbeewah> droid909: that should work

[04:18:45] <Uhkis> sahbeewah: val returns corret value, new Date() from that is correct, Date.toJSON() resets timezone to something weird
[04:18:47] <droid909> sahbeewah: what should work?
[04:18:49] <Kartagis> sahbeewah: opening_date / "2014-09-15"

[04:23:06] <Uhkis> sahbeewah: riiight
[04:23:44] <droid909>  why can't i animate this: $('#my_div').animate({'background-color': '#fff'});  ?
[04:23:44] <Uhkis> because the actual time was 00:00 gmt+3, it went -3h, so yesterday
[04:23:47] <droid909>  why can't i animate this: $('#my_div').animate({'background-color': '#fff'});  ?

[04:25:54] <droid909> this one doesn't work https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[04:26:14] <systemfault> I don't think jQuery does it by default.. you need something in jQueryUI I think
[04:28:12] <droid909> i see
[04:32:34] <sahbeewah> ??
[04:32:40] <sahbeewah> i already said, that should work

[04:51:08] <pmverma> Hi all
[04:51:34] <pmverma> In jQuery ajax, does ".always()"  function works even if ".done() and .fail()" callback are not executed?
[04:54:26] <sahbeewah> pmverma: at what point would you expect .always to be called if neither .done nor .fail are executed?
[04:56:31] <pmverma> sahbeewah, I am not sure at which point, I have posted http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25866666/why-two-ajax-request-is-called-with-following-js-code
[04:57:54] <pmverma> If i comment out the line code for ".always()", then it works
[04:58:30] <pmverma> but I have to use ".always()" as have to make long-polling
[05:13:52] <Horacsio> does anyone know what plugin can make this text effect: http://revaxarts.com/ ?
[05:15:59] <pmverma> Is there any way I can solve my problem?
[05:26:11] <gaius65> The url http://boltzmann.studioq.at/english.html returns status code 303 (redirect), but using jQuery.ajax it returns status code 204. Why?
[05:30:15] <systemfault> 3xx are redirects and XHR ($.ajax) automatically follows redirects
[05:32:51] <gryyy> Horacsio: Just take a look at the page source. You don't really need a framework for that. It's literally 20 lines of code.
[05:33:06] <Horacsio> ok :)
[05:33:31] <Horacsio> but its not kind to stole that code, is it?
[05:33:46] <gryyy> https://gist.github.com/warsh33p/022cb4377c4cdc62b5d5
[05:33:52] <gryyy> This is the function
[05:34:42] <gaius65> systemfault: Ok, that's cool. But why do I then get a 204 "No content"?
[05:35:22] <systemfault> gaius65: Because the redirection is followed by $.ajax and that page that the redirection targets returns 204
[05:35:32] <fris> this code worked in jquery 1.11.0 but doesnt seem to work in 11.11.1 Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[value=][req=yes] any ideas?
[05:36:04] <systemfault> fris:[value=] is invalid
[05:36:28] <systemfault> fris: You want either a value at the right of the =... or just [value] to select the element if it has a value attribute
[05:37:11] <fris> systemfault here is the full line in question var requiredAndEmpty = self.container.find("input[value=][req=yes]");
[05:37:50] <systemfault> It's like I told you, the [value=] part is invalid.
[05:38:14] <systemfault> You probably wantvar requiredAndEmpty = self.container.find("input[value][req=yes]"); instead
[05:38:26] <fris> k
[05:39:52] <fris> ya works now, thanks, but any idea why it works in 1.11.0 and not in 1.11.1?
[05:40:36] <gryyy> To be honest I think it shouldn't have worked in 1.11.0 either. So it might have been a bug.
[05:41:17] <gaius65> systemfault: I don't think it follows the url.
[05:41:27] <DeVito1> is it possable to dasiy chain addclass and remove class on the same statment?
[05:41:27] <DeVito1> Example
[05:41:27] <DeVito1> $this.removeClass('lg2').addClass('lg3');
[05:41:43] <systemfault> gaius65: Are you saying that the XMLHttpRequest specification lies?
[05:41:48] <gaius65> In the network panel I never see a second request and when I directly load the redirected url the ajax returns content.
[05:42:00] <systemfault> That's how it works.
[05:42:07] <gaius65> systemfault: No, I'm saying something works different then when opening in the browser
[05:42:15] <gaius65> And I'm trying to figure out what
[05:43:03] <gryyy> DeVito1: Yes it is
[05:44:15] <DeVito1> nice thanks gryyy
[05:50:01] <gaius65> systemfault: So any idea why it doesn't load the redirect target content?
[05:50:14] <systemfault> Ajax does it.
[05:50:19] <systemfault> You get a 204.
[05:50:31] <systemfault> Which means that the server tells you that there's no content.
[05:52:24] <fris> systemfault the actual jquery plugin isnt mine i was using, its from 2010, prob the authors fault at the time
[05:52:48] <gaius65> systemfault: Ok. So why do I get the content when I do $.ajax('redirected-url.html') then
[05:53:23] <sahbeewah> gaius65: it appears that the server is sniffing for the X-Requested-With header and handling it differently
[05:53:31] <systemfault> ^
[05:54:15] <gaius65> sahbeewah: Fuck. Ok, then I'll need to debug that :/
[05:56:35] <gaius65> systemfault, sahbeewah: Thanks!

[06:18:43] <arschmitz> ldeluca: the simpliest ways are the issue tracker, attend the weekly meetings in #jquery-meeting
[06:18:53] <arschmitz> and just hang around in #jqueryui-dev
[06:21:00] <fris> http://s3.envato.com/files/348021/index.html this is it
[06:22:02] <fris> was using it for a popup search form on a wp site
[06:45:35] <clamstar> Is ajax.googleapis.com giving anyone else problems? If I curl it connects successfully, but then timesout wating for a reponse
[06:46:54] <uskerine> jquery rocks
[06:54:12] <Horacsio> does anyone know whats name for this text effect: http://revaxarts.com/ ? at
[07:02:05] <Uhkis> Horacsio: the word switcher?
[07:02:43] <fris> it just uses animate
[07:03:05] <fris> line 28 to 54 http://revaxarts.com/wp-content/themes/revaxarts/js/script.js
[07:03:06] <Horacsio> yes the word switcher
[07:03:41] <Horacsio> that function go?
[07:03:44] <fris> ya
[07:03:57] <Horacsio> but once again, using this, isn't it wrong?
[07:04:06] <fris> what is wrong?
[07:04:13] <fris> .animate?
[07:04:18] <Horacsio> no
[07:04:24] <Horacsio> the function go :D
[07:04:37] <Uhkis> there's no license provided
[07:04:44] <fris> he just wrapped it in a function
[07:04:55] <fris> if thats what you are asking
[07:05:05] <Horacsio> so it's legal, right?
[07:05:21] <fris> yes
[07:05:29] <Horacsio> ok
[07:05:40] <Horacsio> but what's the correct name for this?
[07:05:45] <Uhkis> for all we know, he copied it from somewhere :p
[07:06:08] <Horacsio> I'm looking for something the replaces a word or bunch of words from a <li>
[07:06:14] <Horacsio> with no class
[07:06:17] <Horacsio> or id
[07:06:31] <fris> seems like that wlll do
[07:06:32] <Horacsio> from a list
[07:06:49] <Horacsio> ok :) but how would you google it?
[07:07:26] <fris> jquery text scroll or something, lookup the animate functions, google change width etc
[07:07:36] <fris> height rather
[07:07:55] <Horacsio> I've searched for jquery word rotator and I get 2 plugins that rotates from a line of words separeted by commas
[07:09:43] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: Like a text search and replace?
[07:10:39] <Horacsio> don't quit understood what you meant.
[07:11:22] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: Yeah I don't understand what you mean either ahah.
[07:11:30] <Horacsio> :D
[07:11:35] <BillCriswell> "I'm looking for something the replaces a word or bunch of words from a <li>"
[07:11:48] <Horacsio> oh ok
[07:11:58] <Horacsio> did you saw the example?
[07:12:04] <BillCriswell> No.
[07:12:10] <Meztek> hi there!, any jquerymobile experts here that could please help me with this crazy problem im having
[07:12:22] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: Oh, I see now.
[07:12:28] <Horacsio> :)
[07:12:30] <Uhkis> Meztek: just ask, someone may or may not answer
[07:12:33] <BillCriswell> but you want the works to be an li?
[07:12:34] <fris> Horacsio what is wrong with the example it doesnt contain any propitary(sp?) code just uses built in animate and css commands
[07:12:54] <Horacsio> yes I know but I would rather use a plugin to be honest
[07:13:02] <fris> why
[07:13:16] <BillCriswell> s/works/words*
[07:13:32] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: worst regex ever :D
[07:13:36] <gryyy> :D
[07:13:43] <fris> odds are th eplugin will be 500-1000 lines of code to do something similiar which will be the worst load time compared to that go function
[07:14:42] <Horacsio> fris: I think I can manage myself with a plugin :D
[07:14:44] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: http://revaxarts.com/wp-content/themes/revaxarts/js/script.js in this script the code is from function go and down.
[07:14:53] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: Haha.
[07:14:54] <Horacsio> yes I got it
[07:14:55] <jftf> Hello all
[07:15:08] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: s is a stupid modifier... on the wrong side.
[07:15:09] <fris> BillCriswell ya i already told him , but he would rather have a plugin to do it (why i dont know)
[07:15:22] <Meztek> ok here it goes:   I have a multipage which is a multipage form, which is all good its working great, problem is after the form gets submitted and you move onto the next page, if you refresh the browser on the next page then click back the multipage doesnt work anyone... all the javascript fails.. any idead?
[07:15:27] <Horacsio> I'm going to test this :)
[07:15:30] <BillCriswell> fris: Oh... Why are you making it complicated Horacsio? Haha
[07:15:31] <Horacsio> thank you my friend
[07:15:39] <Horacsio> friends!
[07:15:41] <gryyy> BillCriswell: I thought you were doing vim style replace
[07:15:55] <BillCriswell> I don't go near vim because it scares me.
[07:16:07] <gryyy> Haha
[07:16:08] <Uhkis> even vim style regex needs to be closed ;-)
[07:16:12] <slax0r> BillCriswell: why?
[07:16:17] <gryyy> That's true
[07:16:36] <BillCriswell> slax0r: Because I haven't taken the time to understand it.
[07:16:41] <BillCriswell> <-- True American.
[07:16:52] <gryyy> http://www.manuelmagic.me/resources/Geek/Text-editors/text_editors.jpg
[07:16:53] <gryyy> ^
[07:17:24] <BillCriswell> I start in Notepad. Syntax highlighting blew my mind the first time I saw it.
[07:17:26] <Uhkis> that emacs is a bit too simplified
[07:17:49] <Cork> sublime ftw
[07:17:57] <BillCriswell> Cork: Agreeeeeed.
[07:17:58] <gryyy> BillCriswell: You must be ancient :D
[07:18:09] <Cork> though ya vim is really nice if you need console support
[07:18:19] <BillCriswell> gryyy: 29.
[07:18:23] <gryyy> As I said
[07:18:24] <gryyy> Ancient
[07:18:29] <Uhkis> need console support? ssh for life!
[07:18:38] <BillCriswell> Cork: Yeah. It seems like it can be really useful when I'm sshed in somewhere.
[07:18:48] <Cork> ya, and i do that a lot
[07:18:54] <Superhans> Hi.. i've got an array filled with objects where one property is a name... i'd like to create a div with a class that matches the name-value, unless it already exsists. Would using jquery be good for doing this? And how?
[07:19:30] <gryyy> I couldn't keep using Sublime at work because we're too cheap to buy a license. So I just started using vim
[07:19:38] <gryyy> And now I can't use any other editor
[07:20:11] <gryyy> But there's definitely a learning curve (or cliff)
[07:20:27] <fris> Horacsio here is a list plugin which fades into the next result http://medienfreunde.com/lab/innerfade/ scroll down the pafge to examples with the one with a bunch of <li>'s like the go function one does
[07:20:37] <Uhkis> insert mode, normal mode, :x what else do you need for basic stuff?
[07:21:19] <gryyy> Navigation with hjkl messes people up when they first try vim
[07:21:48] <Horacsio> fris: THANKS ;)
[07:30:43] <jftf> I need to talk out a logic problem: I am trying to implement a lazy-loading picturefill, which processes picturefill in slideshows and modals.

[07:41:23] <TheAtomicGoose> how would i get all span elements with the attribute hidden=""? i tried $('span[hidden=""]');, but that doesn't seem to be doing the trick.
[07:46:56] <axilla> hi all, does .insertAfter not work in ie8?
[07:46:58] <blackkbot> span[hidden]
[07:47:02] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: don't add random attributes on elements without the data- prefix
[07:47:15] <Cork> axilla: it does
[07:47:53] <TheAtomicGoose> Cork: i'm not trying to add attributes, just see if they're there. i think i'm misunderstanding your question, but i'm not sure
[07:48:05] <TheAtomicGoose> blackkbot: thanks
[07:48:14] <axilla> hmmm, doesn't appear to be.
[07:48:18] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: hidden isn't a valid attribute on spans
[07:48:35] <axilla> i use jqmodal to display modals in my app
[07:48:38] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: and like i said you shouldn't add random attributes on dom elements without the prefix
[07:48:48] <axilla> jqmodal uses this line to append the modal to the body o.toTop&&v&&e.before('<span id="jqmP'+o.ID+'"></span>').insertAfter(v);
[07:48:56] <axilla> it works perfectly fine in everything except ie8
[07:48:57] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: so instead of hidden you should use data-hidden
[07:49:12] <wfq> hi guys
[07:49:16] <Cork> (data- is a reserved prefix for the site developer)
[07:49:22] <TheAtomicGoose> Cork: this isn't a webpage i can edit. but in what way is hidden invalid on a span?
[07:49:45] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: it isn't an attribute defined by the spec
[07:49:58] <TheAtomicGoose> Cork: i'm just trying to print out the contents of a bunch of hidden spans on a page
[07:49:58] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: if you try to validate the page it won't
[07:50:14] <sdfsdfw> hello
[07:50:16] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: are you sure they are hidden attributes
[07:50:20] <Cork> and not hidden classes?
[07:51:03] <TheAtomicGoose> Cork: fairly, since the code is <span hidden="">text</span>
[07:51:09] <wfq> I have a code snippet that isn't working very well. Basically the problem is that they are using jquery.dataTable and associating an event to sum buttoms in each row on the table however such association only happens for the first page and not for the subsequent ones.
[07:51:54] <wfq> In short when you click on next, the rows of the table containing button do not have the onclick event associated. This is because the document.ready is not triggered as the the page is not reloaded
[07:52:00] <wfq> how could I bypass such thing please?
[07:52:32] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: then the one who can edit the page should run the page through validator.w3.or
[07:52:40] <Cork> * validator.w3.org
[07:52:51] <Cork> and correct the validation errors
[07:53:28] <TheAtomicGoose> Cork: not an option in this case, i'm trying to get through a challenge that i was assigned
[07:53:39] <Cork> ugg
[07:53:51] <Cork> yay... a challenge with a broken case...
[07:54:05] <Cork> lovely when they try to teach ppl to do the wrong thing >_<
[07:54:43] <TheAtomicGoose> Cork: it's definitely solvable
[07:54:48] <TheAtomicGoose> Cork: it's actually part of an internship application :P
[07:54:53] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: sure, it isn't about solvable
[07:54:57] <Cork> but the case is invalid
[07:55:14] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: i would run...
[07:55:27] <Cork> if they don't even know what valid html is... i wouldn't want to work there
[07:56:03] <TheAtomicGoose> Cork: ...but if i were to not run...as it's kinda my best option at the moment...how would i print out all the hidden spans?
[07:56:37] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: the selector blackkbot gave you
[07:56:38] <decx> that's when you go to the bosses office tell him to get rid of the recruiter because jesus has just arrived and is here to save the day
[07:56:50] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: the selector is valid, the element isn't
[07:56:55] <TheAtomicGoose> Cork: oh, ok, thanks
[07:57:08] <Cork> lol
[07:57:19] <Cork> or ask them to let you correct the invalid page...
[07:58:09] <decx> then the recruiter will just silence you with a nice: we'll contact you when something turns up
[07:58:51] <TheAtomicGoose> Cork: i'm not going to risk them being like, "well this kid's a prick" as it's already rather unusual for a high school student to get an internship
[07:59:07] <Cork> TheAtomicGoose: ya, i know
[07:59:22] <Cork> and ya, intranets often demand ie6 for a reason
[07:59:29] <Cork> -- they ignore web standards
[07:59:32] <petzup> hy i have problem here http://www.bootply.com/KKJgO1NYBn, how would i do that i can search from both input and also both input are clicked by one button http://www.bootply.com/KKJgO1NYBn
[08:04:33] <tomXx> is there a way to save the term been typed in JQUERYUI autocomplete for later use in functions?
[08:05:33] <decx> it's just another input, save it into a var
[08:05:54] <petzup> can someone help me with this code http://www.bootply.com/KKJgO1NYBn#, i cannot get to work search form right, it doesnt submit my form when i press submit
[08:07:52] <decx> am i blind or is there no .search class?
[08:08:04] <petzup> <div class="search">
[08:08:11] <petzup> it is in first row
[08:10:09] <decx> find('input').val() will just look at the first inputs val in that collection
[08:10:20] <marc_v92> petzup: The code seems to be fine, but it won’t submit on that page because it’s in a sandboxed environment.
[08:10:24] <decx> so it will only submit if you have something in search by business
[08:10:43] <marc_v92> petzup: Check the error console in dev tools to see.
[08:11:00] <Cork> ugg that page needs a real run through a validator...
[08:11:05] <petzup> decx, yep right, that is problem, it always looks only first input instead input in selected tab
[08:12:34] <petzup> decx, do you know how would i search for input inside selected tab?
[08:12:58] <decx> if ($('.input-lg[name=search]').val() || $('.input-lg[name=search-zip]').val() ) maybe
[08:13:01] <decx> something like that
[08:13:39] <decx> or that yeah
[08:13:45] <tomXx> decx - i mean dinamicly, as the user types it, before he press send
[08:14:09] <decx> if($('.tab-content .active').find('input').val()){
[08:14:33] <mnms_> guys is there any way to find what is changing selected value in select
[08:14:37] <mnms_> which part of code ?
[08:14:54] <decx> ctrl-f select ^^
[08:15:12] <mnms_> decx: I would do this several years
[08:15:26] <decx> well then you better get started eh?
[08:15:56] <john_doe_jr> how do you add tabs to a dialog box?
[08:16:13] <mnms_> I have been thinking there is a better method for that
[08:17:02] <petzup> yea works, tnx
[08:17:13] <mnms_> I need to look for it also in minified versions :(
[08:19:20] <tomXx> decx  thanks
[08:37:49] <john_doe_jr> how do  I create a jquery dialog button but append it to the page?
[08:39:36] <robertmaxrees> you mean like be able to append the button to the page and still have it work?
[08:39:57] <john_doe_jr> I have a button and I want to add a dialog button to the page when a user clicks on the button
[08:40:12] <john_doe_jr> so it doesn't have a selector yet
[08:40:14] <robertmaxrees> "dialog button" is confusing me - could you clarify what you mean by that?
[08:41:01] <john_doe_jr> robbyoconnor: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[08:41:28] <robertmaxrees> right, I'm aware of the jquery ui dialog - do you want to be able to launch the dialog from a dynamically added element?
[08:41:48] <john_doe_jr> robbyoconnor: if you click on view source on that page it will show that it is using the $("#dialog") selector but I don't have a html dialog div yet
[08:41:58] <john_doe_jr> robbyoconnor: yes
[08:41:58] <robertmaxrees> heh you keep tab completing to the wrong number :)
[08:42:00] <robertmaxrees> *name
[08:42:14] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: sorry your right
[08:42:22] <john_doe_jr> sorry robby
[08:42:37] <robertmaxrees> check out the API docs here - http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[08:42:49] <robertmaxrees> this well tell you how you can launch the dialog manually.
[08:42:59] <robertmaxrees> just use a delegated event listener and you're set.
[08:44:08] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: the examples all assume a selector though
[08:44:20] <robertmaxrees> john_doe_jr they assume an element :)
[08:44:43] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean for the dialog body?
[08:44:51] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: yes
[08:44:59] <robertmaxrees> you have to have some way to reference it.
[08:45:12] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: so have it hidden ?
[08:45:19] <john_doe_jr> $( ".selector" ).dialog({ appendTo: "#someElem" });
[08:45:26] <robertmaxrees> when you append the dialog content to the page you need to have an ID or (unique) class to reference it back to.
[08:46:19] <robertmaxrees> appendTo isn't the right thing to use in this case.
[08:46:31] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle showing what you're doing right now?
[08:47:05] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: I just want to create the dialog box as an overlay in the current window when a number of tabs in the dialog box…I'm just very new to jquery
[08:47:12] <decx> you can feed a fragment into dialog as well
[08:47:24] <decx> ie var dialog = $('<ul>',{ html: '<li>1</li><li>2</li>'}); dialog.dialog()
[08:47:35] <robertmaxrees> decx's idea would work to.
[08:47:53] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that you need some kind of reference back to the element.  it could be a fragment or a selector you give it.
[08:49:24] <john_doe_jr> decx: hey that worked
[08:49:40] <john_doe_jr> decx: thank you
[08:49:51] <robertmaxrees> i forgot that dialogs accept fragments.
[08:49:52] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: thank you as well
[08:50:02] <robertmaxrees> makes total sense though.
[08:50:09] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: now I need to create tabs in the dialog box
[08:50:49] <jakey> are you trying to make a form in a dialog box? That's not a good idea
[08:51:04] <robertmaxrees> what's with the tabs?
[08:51:04] <john_doe_jr> jakey: why not?
[08:52:07] <jakey> john_doe_jr: they won't be cached by the browser if you do a submit/back button type thing, it's also fairly clunky to port to mobile
[08:52:10] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: basically I need it to look like the following site: http://www.mbta.com/ under "Plan your trip Landmarks & Stations" ….they are going it with asp but I would like to do that with jquery
[08:52:28] <robertmaxrees> john_doe_jr errr...
[08:52:35] <robertmaxrees> asp and jquery are two parts of the equation.
[08:52:50] <robertmaxrees> asp generates your markup and handles backend stuff.  jquery is for your frontend.
[08:52:54] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: I know but I thought I could do that same thing with asp
[08:53:09] <jakey> http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[08:53:10] <decx> why are local transportation websites always so dense and cluttered?
[08:53:24] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: just look @ the form it doesn't do anything server site…it just adds text to the textfield
[08:53:27] <jakey> because trendy designers don't look for government jobs
[08:53:35] <john_doe_jr> jakey: lol
[08:53:50] <robertmaxrees> john_doe_jr you're convoluting the roles of asp and javascript.
[08:53:52] <decx> huh, yeah i guess that makes sense
[08:54:25] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: I realize that javascript (jquery) is a client side operation but the form isn't touching anything server side
[08:54:42] <robertmaxrees> john_doe_jr then why did you mention the ASP part?  i'm lost.
[08:54:46] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: it is just setting the value of the textfield
[08:54:59] <robertmaxrees> either way, i'd avoid doing that kind of interface in a modal in the first place.  that's overly compacted and not very user friendly imo.
[08:55:10] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: well, I should not have mentioned it…I just realize that the site was created using asp
[08:55:32] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: I agree but that is what my client wants
[08:55:57] <robertmaxrees> learn to use http://jsfiddle.net/ btw.
[08:56:24] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: alright I'd take a look at it
[08:56:33] <robertmaxrees> it'll let people like us help you much better.
[08:56:44] <robertmaxrees> also, learn.jquery.com will be a big help, too.
[08:57:09] <TheAtomicGoose> could i remove an element which lacks a specific attribute by doing $("span[!hidden]").delete?
[08:57:31] <TheAtomicGoose> sorry, i meant .remove not .delete
[08:57:36] <decx> filter
[08:58:31] <robertmaxrees> $(element).filter(function() { return !$(this).prop('class') });
[08:58:47] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: well, I'm staring to learn jquery…gotta start somewhere
[08:58:58] <robertmaxrees> john_doe_jr yep, that's what learn.jquery.com is great for.
[09:00:33] <jakey> I want to be learning whilst getting clients :<
[09:00:48] <john_doe_jr> jakey: on the job training
[09:01:09] <decx> i learn every day
[09:01:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, good employers will let you learn and play with shit on the job.
[09:02:00] <TheAtomicGoose> robertmaxrees: could i put in "hidden" where you put "class"?
[09:02:16] <decx> you can put any old check
[09:02:19] <jakey> well, I AM on IRC, so I guess I can't really moan too much
[09:02:27] <robertmaxrees> TheAtomicGoose that's not a valid html attribute, and while it'll usually get ignored, it's not a great idea.
[09:02:28] <decx> .is(':hidden') here fE
[09:02:54] <decx> oh a hidden attribute
[09:03:03] <decx> blimey
[09:03:11] <robertmaxrees> use a class or something.
[09:05:47] <jakey> http://jsfiddle.net/99L144sh/
[09:06:03] <robertmaxrees> :(
[09:06:06] <jakey> lol
[09:06:31] <robertmaxrees> don't link to code.jquery.com btw
[09:06:43] <robertmaxrees> and this is what you're looking for: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/99L144sh/1/
[09:07:05] <jakey> I tried that but was getting errors, are you a wizard
[09:07:14] <robertmaxrees> what "errors" were you getting?
[09:07:21] <jakey> 404, could not get resource
[09:07:47] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[09:08:08] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/99L144sh/2/
[09:08:12] <robertmaxrees> inline handlers make me sad.
[09:08:15] <jakey> so do you prefer jsfiddle to codepen
[09:08:24] <robertmaxrees> i personally prefer it yeah.
[09:08:30] <robertmaxrees> over codepen, jsbin, etc.
[09:13:48] <jdewald> robertmaxrees: Why not link to code.jquery?
[09:14:21] <robertmaxrees> http://blog.jquery.com/2014/07/03/dont-use-jquery-latest-js/ is part of it.
[09:14:37] <robertmaxrees> well, not to latest.
[09:14:55] <robertmaxrees> code.jquery.com is fine if you're not using the latest version.
[09:15:01] <jdewald> Ah, right ;)
[09:15:26] <robertmaxrees> caffeine hasn't hit this morning.  also no need to use the external resource panel in jsfiddle
[09:17:32] <decx> damn 35 billion hits
[09:19:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[09:25:24] <john_doe_jr> decx: in the dialog.html property…can you reference a file?
[09:26:26] <decx> ajax the file, on done send it to your dialog
[09:27:40] <john_doe_jr> ajax the file?
[09:28:29] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/u7uavve7/
[09:30:23] <jakey> I would recommend opening the dialog immediately and showing a spinner until the resource loads
[09:32:05] <john_doe_jr> decx: why ajax the file?…I mean it works but I'd like to know why you are using that function
[09:32:21] <robertmaxrees> john_doe_jr because you can't load the content otherwise.
[09:32:47] <robertmaxrees> unless you build the html on the page or include it via a hidden container on your page.
[09:32:56] <jakey> http://jsfiddle.net/u7uavve7/1/
[09:34:48] <decx> either way, ajax and fill on done
[09:35:16] <decx> i actually prefer to have the loading response directly on the element that was activated
[09:35:33] <decx> click button, button say: loading or whatever
[09:35:37] <decx> says
[09:37:03] <john_doe_jr> decx: awesome that worked!
[09:38:34] <john_doe_jr> decx: well, I'm trying to make the tabs look like http://jqueryui.com/tabs/ but it is just showing an un-ordered list
[09:38:55] <robertmaxrees> john_doe_jr you have to init the tabs after the modal has loaded.
[09:39:00] <robertmaxrees> inside that .done() call
[09:39:12] <decx> you have to use the jquery ui css
[09:39:20] <robertmaxrees> or do that.
[09:39:59] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: so $( "#tabs" ).tabs();
[09:40:22] <robertmaxrees> if that's the ID you've given to the tabs container, sure.
[09:41:24] <decx> if you see an unordered list then your tabs were initialized but miss the styles
[09:41:48] <decx> because the ul gets added by tabs()
[09:43:20] <john_doe_jr> decx: well, now it's three tabs inside a dialog window
[09:43:47] <john_doe_jr> decx: I'm getting close though…I just want to display the tabs
[09:43:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:44:02] <robertmaxrees> as opposed to what?
[09:44:56] <john_doe_jr> robertmaxrees: actually never mind that is exactly what I want
[09:45:03] <john_doe_jr> decx: thank you all
[09:46:48] <saucey> ey guys im trying to trigger an event when the element has been removed from the DOM, but im getting cross browser problems, this is the event $(this).on('DOMNodeRemoved', function(e) {....} this only seems to work in firefox
[09:47:51] <john_doe_jr> decx: alright…how would I reproduce the split window in jquery?
[09:48:18] <decx> i dont kno what that means
[09:48:55] <john_doe_jr> decx: when you got to http://www.mbta.com/ and click on the "Plan your trip using Landmarks & Stations"…it shows a split window
[09:49:35] <decx> that's just two selects
[09:49:52] <john_doe_jr> decx: I see…so html select
[09:50:04] <john_doe_jr> decx: in a container div
[09:50:51] <john_doe_jr> decx: does jquery handle that more elegantly than normally html?
[09:51:23] <decx> this is the moment where i slowly back out of the room
[09:52:49] <robertmaxrees> saucey don't do that.
[09:53:07] <saucey> well what do i do?
[09:53:13] <john_doe_jr> decx: alright I've bothered u enough
[09:53:17] <john_doe_jr> decx: sorry
[09:55:33] <robertmaxrees> saucey what's the problem you're solving for?
[09:55:40] <robertmaxrees> are you removing the element yourself?
[09:57:27] <robertmaxrees> john_doe_jr have you done the tutorial on learn.jquery.com yet?
[10:04:30] <saucey> yes im removing the element myself
[10:05:27] <robertmaxrees> saucey then call your other function when you do the removal instead.
[10:05:59] <saucey> let me send u a pastie
[10:06:22] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be even better :)
[10:06:55] <saucey> ive tried this http://pastie.org/9559307
[10:07:32] <saucey> im using tinymce
[10:07:42] <robertmaxrees> $(this).('remove', function(e) { wat
[10:08:24] <saucey> i need to fire an event when the item has been removed from the dom?
[10:08:25] <robertmaxrees> can you explain what you're actually trying to do?
[10:08:43] <robertmaxrees> like, start from the beginning :)
[10:09:13] <jakey> pastie... risky DN of the day
[10:10:10] <decx> the easiest way is to trigger a custom event
[10:10:20] <saucey> i have tinymce, when i upload an image it saves the file into my images path folder, but when i delete the a selected image from the tinymce to delete, it doesnt remove the file in the image directory, so i need a way of knowing which image was removed from the dom so i can do an ajax call to remove the file
[10:10:37] <robertmaxrees> do it in your callback of the click, then.
[10:11:32] <robertmaxrees> or the change.
[10:16:37] <jakey> aaaaaand the My Work section is done
[10:18:31] <Sht0> Hi! I have this piece of code and I'm kind of stuck -> http://jsfiddle.net/3wzb9s0y Someone kind enough to help me a bit, pls? :)
[10:19:04] <robertmaxrees> Sht0 ps don't use script tags in the javascript panel.
[10:19:11] <jakey> ^
[10:19:15] <robertmaxrees> and you want deferred objects :)
[10:20:07] <jakey> why not promises?
[10:20:23] <robertmaxrees> promises are apart of deferreds :)
[10:20:50] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/
[10:22:15] <Sht0> I'll try to read and understand that, I'm new to js/jquery
[10:22:48] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/
[10:22:51] <robertmaxrees> this should help, yoo.
[10:24:38] <Sht0> Thanks robertmaxrees!
[10:24:55] <jakey> god I love promises
[10:26:47] <robertmaxrees> it's too bad the jquery version isn't spec compliant.
[10:26:51] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, theyr'e great otherwise.
[10:26:54] <robertmaxrees> *they're
[10:30:14] <Bumptious> is there a way to get a data-attribute using $('.something').get(0).data() ?
[10:30:20] <Bumptious> that doesn't seem to work
[10:30:23] <robertmaxrees> .eq(0)
[10:30:30] <robertmaxrees> .get() gets the underlying DOM node.
[10:31:35] <jakey> I always had trouble with data attributes, I usually just resort to $('selector:first-child').attr('data-mycoolthing')
[10:31:40] <Bumptious> ah ha!
[10:31:43] <robertmaxrees> don't do that :(
[10:31:52] <Bumptious> eq(0) works wonderfully
[10:31:59] <robertmaxrees> jakey first off, use .prop() instead of .attr()
[10:32:10] <robertmaxrees> and for data, you're losing all the benefits of using .data() instead.
[10:32:20] <robertmaxrees> since that references a cached version
[10:32:33] <robertmaxrees> instead of the actual node. DOM lookups are expensive.
[10:32:48] <jakey> noted, thanks
[10:33:16] <robertmaxrees> there are some quirks with casing and types when referencing data attributes using it. but it's pretty easy to work with otherwise.
[10:33:37] <yuradoc> Hello. how i could detect when user trying to move cursor after it is already at the end of input or textarea. i need to make work it like tab pressed
[10:34:51] <decx> mouseout
[10:35:00] <decx> or was it mouseleave
[10:35:04] <robertmaxrees> I think they mean the text cursor
[10:35:08] <decx> blur
[10:35:19] <decx> i'm just shouting random events now
[10:35:28] <decx> click hover custom
[10:36:04] <yuradoc> i mean text cursor
[10:36:24] <robertmaxrees> #nailedit
[10:37:02] <decx> is that a manicurist room
[10:37:08] <Bumptious> robertmaxrees: thank you
[10:37:22] <Bumptious> robertmaxrees: get() gets the underlying DOM node, what does eq get?
[10:37:23] <robertmaxrees> Bumptious fsho
[10:37:41] <robertmaxrees> eq gets the object in the collection at that index.
[10:38:07] <Bumptious> something a little wierd.  when I use get(), I can then use .id
[10:38:11] <Bumptious> but when I use eq, I can't
[10:38:14] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:38:23] <jakey> http://jsfiddle.net/nick_craver/FCWrE/
[10:38:23] <robertmaxrees> because jquery objects don't have a .id property.
[10:38:29] <robertmaxrees> you could do .prop('id') though
[10:38:48] <jakey> something like $thing.caret().start == $thing.length
[10:39:13] <robertmaxrees> that assumes that you're using a monospaced font btw.
[10:40:07] <jakey> wow. that is some hacked-up shit right there
[10:40:28] <jakey> demo seems to be okay with it other than this odd 0-indexing thing if you go to the beginning
[10:40:54] <yuradoc> wow jakey - it's really cool
[10:41:01] <yuradoc> tnx
[10:41:08] <jakey> GL looks buggy :P
[10:43:44] <yuradoc> http://jsfiddle.net/FCWrE/1366/
[10:43:52] <yuradoc> this works better
[10:44:07] <robertmaxrees> lol mousemove?
[10:44:31] <jakey> for dragging I assume
[10:44:59] <yuradoc> sorry, someth fail..it was working
[10:45:26] <P0RK> Hey all. How do I trap the "change" event with radio buttons? Do I bind to the individual buttons?
[10:46:26] <jakey> do they have a class? $('.radioClass').change(function() { alter(this + ' is the winner') })
[10:46:38] <jakey> alter -_- alert*
[10:46:50] <robertmaxrees> use console.log(), not alert for debugging :(
[10:47:12] <jakey> I guess you aren't EXTREME enough, robertmaxrees ;D
[10:47:39] <robertmaxrees> alert stops page execution and can make things not behave like they would in the real world.
[10:48:32] <jakey> granted, also it executes before the event defaults complete right?
[10:49:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:49:16] <yuradoc> it's works, but after refresh jsfiddle. i think it buggy when you set cursor to code than try to use generated code....
[10:49:41] <jakey> well, maybe not, depending on when .change fires
[10:50:10] <robertmaxrees> jakey that still doesn't make any sense.
[10:50:16] <jakey> I know that getting .val() out of a .keydown() event won't give you the just-sent-in-letter
[10:51:01] <robertmaxrees> P0RK http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ow5r7x88/1/
[10:52:29] <P0RK> Brilliant. Thanks
[10:53:16] <robertmaxrees> that binds a single delegated listener, so it'll work for anything that gets added down the road, too.
[10:56:01] <jakey> robertmaxrees: when I was trying to make a typing game, I was struggling with the correct listener to use, ended up with 'input'
[10:56:05] <jakey> http://jsfiddle.net/vq48146u/
[10:57:04] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember if input is shimmed via jquery.
[10:57:05] <robertmaxrees> might be.
[10:57:33] <decx> no
[10:58:07] <P0RK> When you wrap the radio button in a label and then hide the radio button, how do you get to the label on change event
[10:58:17] <jorvis> Is there a problem with Jquery and SVGs?  I have 5 SVGs I'm including with <object> tags, and on page load alone I get 5 exact errors like this one:  http://pastie.org/9559404  I have no idea where that's coming from.
[10:58:38] <robertmaxrees> P0RK you don't. you want the change event still.
[10:58:56] <P0RK> Well, it's safest to first assume it's jquery jorvis. LOL
[10:59:09] <jorvis> I don't, but when I remove the jquery include line it goes away
[10:59:56] <P0RK> robertmaxrees, Right. I know that. But what I don't get is how to stylize the label to indicated "selected"
[11:00:12] <P0RK> thanks for your help by the way. Didn;'t mean to sound short there.
[11:01:41] <robertmaxrees> could do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ow5r7x88/3/
[11:03:09] <P0RK> What I need is a "closest or nearest" function that grabs the label if it's nearby or wrapped around the thing. That'd be dreamy
[11:03:20] <decx> it's called closest
[11:03:24] <decx> believe that
[11:03:45] <jorvis> $(event.target).closest('#search_results_c')
[11:03:53] <jorvis> example from the code I'm working on now
[11:04:02] <decx> you can also put the label behind the input with a for attribute and use css only
[11:04:04] <robertmaxrees> P0RK .closest() will go up the tree until it finds the element in question.
[11:04:11] <decx> which is neat but ultimately pointless
[11:04:30] <robertmaxrees> there is no "visually closest" method.
[11:04:56] <P0RK> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ow5r7x88/6/
[11:05:12] <P0RK> Doesn't work if Label isn't wrapped around the radio button
[11:05:25] <john_doe_jr> decx: hey…sometimes the form will not load correctly and will just show un-ordered lists…any reason why?  Is it the way I am loading jquery or something…this just occurs every now and again?
[11:05:49] <robertmaxrees> P0RK right...
[11:06:07] <robertmaxrees> P0RK are you going to mix how you're doing it?
[11:06:13] <robertmaxrees> or are you going to do it the same way consistently?
[11:06:30] <robertmaxrees> (protip: do it the second way)
[11:07:02] <P0RK> Not every situation lends itself to labeling the same way.
[11:07:05] <decx> no idea john_doe_jr
[11:07:19] <robertmaxrees> P0RK i mean in this one case.
[11:07:20] <P0RK> Tables of radio buttons can't be wrapped in labels
[11:07:38] <robertmaxrees> right, but you're not mixing it in this one area, right?
[11:07:43] <decx> why not?
[11:07:47] <decx> a radio button needs a label
[11:07:49] <P0RK> I have 150 pages (doublesided) that I am trying to make into some sort of online form lol
[11:08:04] <decx> homerdisappearsintobush.gif
[11:08:13] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:08:27] <robertmaxrees> don't do a single change listener for all radios kthx
[11:08:28] <P0RK> It's ridiculous. Every worked with an attorney before?
[11:09:06] <decx> he had strange pictures on his desk and his hands were small
[11:09:20] <P0RK> Oh, I know that guy...
[11:09:48] <jakey> there was a huge lawsuit when I worked in the larger office of my company.. the lawyer was a grumpy looking dude with the most impressive beard I've seen yet
[11:18:20] <P0RK> would there be any reasonable advantage to having a script that traversed the dom from an elements perspective? Like check my siblings first, then my parents.  then  their siblings and then their parents.
[11:20:03] <robertmaxrees> dom traversal is slow no matter what.
[11:20:22] <robertmaxrees> limiting your area is going to be your best bet.
[11:41:23] <TheLogan> Good evening =)
[11:43:02] <robertmaxrees> good morning!
[11:43:08] <TheLogan> Heh
[11:45:28] <TheLogan> I'm pretty new to JQuery, but trying to learn. :)                  Currently I'm trying to add some jquery functionality to a razorpage in my project.    basically I have this:      http://pastebin.com/irBXD31m The problem is that it doesn't seem like the "ChangeMe" method is ever called.   If instead I place the alert inside a $(document).ready()   then it fires when I start the page. So I know at least that I have it in the right
[11:49:57] <robertmaxrees> TheLogan first off, don't bind inline like that
[11:50:08] <robertmaxrees> give the element an ID and do a binding that way instead.
[11:50:26] <robertmaxrees> second off, you have to do it in a doc ready OR put your JS after the relevant HTML.
[11:50:52] <TheLogan> Ok, it's now in a doc ready
[11:51:19] <TheLogan> But I'm not entirely sure what you mean by bind inline.. that's the onchange="" stuff, right?
[11:51:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[11:51:34] <robertmaxrees> don't use onchange like that.  what kind of input is this?
[11:51:55] <robertmaxrees> (i don't read razor, and neither does jquery/javascript :) )
[11:52:35] <TheLogan> robertmaxrees: It's a dropdown menu working on an enum
[11:52:54] <robertmaxrees> TheLogan lol none of that matters to the stuff in the browser :)
[11:53:05] <robertmaxrees> that's generating HTML.  can you grab the rendered output?
[11:53:14] <TheLogan> certainly
[11:54:11] <TheLogan> robertmaxrees: http://prntscr.com/4ng7qa
[11:54:22] <puchacz> hi, what's the recommended upload jquery library?
[11:54:36] <robertmaxrees> TheLogan okay, that's simple.  one sec.
[11:54:54] <decx> most people come in here asking for support on blueimps uploader
[11:55:20] <puchacz> decx: have you used it?
[11:55:25] <decx> no
[11:55:37] <robertmaxrees> TheLogan http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/073dwjp8/
[11:55:41] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this instead.
[11:56:17] <robertmaxrees> TheLogan http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/073dwjp8/2/ for a more specific example.
[11:56:33] <TheLogan> heh, waiting for it to initialize xD
[11:57:53] <TheLogan> robertmaxrees: Excellent, I'll try it out now. Thanks =)
[11:58:02] <robertmaxrees> deffo. and check out learn.jquery.com
[12:00:31] <TheLogan> robertmaxrees: It works perfectly! Thanks =)
[12:00:41] <robertmaxrees> cool
[12:01:21] <TheLogan> robertmaxrees: actually right now I'm working my way through code academys jquery tutorial. I'm 71% done with module 3 of 5 :D
[12:01:36] <robertmaxrees> i don't know anything about their tutorial, but cool.
[12:01:46] <TheLogan> I might look at learn.jquery.com afterwards though =)
[12:02:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd start there personally, but meh,
[12:02:36] <TheLogan> Well it's pretty cool because it's bitesized and they've got an interpreter (I think that's what it's called??) that looks at your code, prints it out in a sort of browser window and checks whether you've actually done as you were told xD
[12:04:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah i've heard about that.  can't vouch for any quality.  though it does sound like maybe we should consider adding that to the learning center.
[12:04:12] <TheLogan> But while learning from the codeacademy I'm also trying to apply what I'm learning to my own website (kinda bouncing around between things.. helps me stay focused when I'm getting tired)
[12:04:48] <TheLogan> I've learned quite a bit from them already. Everything I know about css is from there, and almost everything I know about html too.
[12:05:37] <robertmaxrees> they didn't have you use onchange, right?
[12:05:38] <TheLogan> The quality does seem fairly high, and being able to learn while doing with instant feedback really is the best way to do stuff =)
[12:05:45] <TheLogan> Nope xD
[12:05:49] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[12:06:01] <TheLogan> That was me who got over excited when I learned about .val :D
[12:06:03] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com is a great thing to have bookmarked, btw.
[12:07:26] <TheLogan> Wow, thanks! That is excellent. I have one for unity3D (game engine I also program in), Almost couldn't live without a reference guide like that! =)
[12:08:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the jquery api docs are a fantastic resource.  lots of examples.  also check out MDN - that's my personal favorite html, css, and js reference.
[12:08:12] <TheLogan> for unity3D I mean. And I'm sure this one for JQ will be invaluable as I move deeper into it. Seriously, thanks! =)
[12:08:58] <TheLogan> Hah, I first thought you wrote MSDN (which I find horrible xD I don't remember ever finding useful info on MSDN xD )
[12:09:27] <robertmaxrees> ... MSDN isn't too bad, but i could see the confusion.
[12:09:55] <TheLogan> robertmaxrees: you mean mozilla developer network?
[12:09:59] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:10:16] <Blitty> hi
[12:10:44] <Blitty> How can I to remove the first 2 chars of a string?
[12:10:45] <TheLogan> Well yeah. Often times it seems like 200 lines of code and the thing you were looking for is used only once in the whole thing. I usually opt for dotnetpearls if they have what I'm looking for =)
[12:11:13] <robertmaxrees> Blitty check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice
[12:11:36] <Blitty> robertmaxrees : thank you so much!!
[12:11:49] <TheLogan> I'll bookmark MDN too then. I've actually used FF for many years, and applauded mozillas efforts into teaching young people coding. But I honestly hadn't thought of using their guides my self.. I have no idea why o_0
[12:12:05] <robertmaxrees> MDN is sort of a canonical reference, especially for javascript.
[12:12:36] <robertmaxrees> Blitty there's also .substr()
[12:12:44] <robertmaxrees> Blitty http://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/trim-firstlast-characters-in-string/
[12:12:45] <TheLogan> Yeah, I can see they really have a lot of information on many different things
[12:16:28] <TheLogan> Must admit that I'm continously amazed at how powerful JQuery is
[12:16:45] <robertmaxrees> jQuery is the proper casing btw :)
[12:17:04] <TheLogan> And I'm still only scratch the air above the surface xD
[12:17:30] <robertmaxrees> it does a great job of abstracting out the bits of the DOM i don't like.
[12:17:41] <TheLogan> Oh, small j capitol Q coolio, I'll remember that =)
[12:17:42] <robertmaxrees> there are some gotchas, but nothing too terrible imo.
[12:17:59] <TheLogan> Ok =)
[12:18:05] <jyg> Hi all. Is there such a thing that would be like a horizontal select list?  Where, as opposed to a dropdown list, the options are traversed by clicking on buttons to the left and right of the field? I don't even know what to call this to make a good search for it
[12:19:09] <robertmaxrees> are you just moving a highlight or something?
[12:20:23] <Blitty> http://jsfiddle.net/1z3wdbnj/
[12:20:50] <Blitty> For example in this script if I need to remove only the first char
[12:20:53] <Blitty> how will be?
[12:20:57] <robertmaxrees> use console.log...
[12:20:59] <DeVito> I know this is off topic, is there a freenode channel for twitter bootstrap?
[12:21:04] <robertmaxrees> and why are you using -1?
[12:21:27] <Blitty> honestly I don't understood clearly the method
[12:21:59] <robertmaxrees> that returns a new string from those indexes.
[12:22:01] <robertmaxrees> 0 based.
[12:22:36] <TheLogan> How do you see the console on robertmaxrees jsfiddle?
[12:22:47] <robertmaxrees> hit f12.
[12:22:49] <robertmaxrees> click "console"
[12:22:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1z3wdbnj/3/
[12:22:57] <robertmaxrees> this does what you want.
[12:23:16] <TheLogan> Oh.. derp xD
[12:23:35] <Blitty> yes man
[12:23:42] <Blitty> thank you so much again
[12:23:48] <robertmaxrees> yep
[12:27:26] <P0RK> Would it be miserable to write a selector like $(this).closest(".someClass").siblings(".active").removeClass("active")
[12:27:36] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:27:43] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of traversal.
[12:28:55] <P0RK> I'm just gonna use global variables. Less traversal easier to keep up with
[12:29:01] <robertmaxrees> :(
[12:29:03] <robertmaxrees> don't do that either.
[12:29:15] <robertmaxrees> globals are hacky and pollute the namespace unnecessarily.
[12:29:49] <robertmaxrees> if you need a single data store, create an object to put stuff into instead.
[12:30:17] <P0RK> I have a feeling I can do this all with css.
[12:30:18] <P0RK> I hate css.
[12:30:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:30:54] <robertmaxrees> mark the parent group as active, then style the child through that.
[12:31:26] <Blitty> robertmaxrees : my fiend I use the replace function for remove the dots but just remove one dot
[12:31:27] <Blitty> why?
[12:31:47] <robertmaxrees> Blitty fiddle up an example.
[12:32:07] <robertmaxrees> but it's probably because you're doing something like 'This is a string..'.replace('.', '');
[12:32:15] <robertmaxrees> that finds one dot, replaces it, then moves on.
[12:32:33] <robertmaxrees> if you want to do all the dots, you need a regular expression.
[12:33:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qcnefx3n/
[12:34:30] <Blitty> robertmaxrees : were that
[12:34:31] <Blitty> all ok
[12:34:33] <Blitty> tkz
[12:36:22] <TheLogan> robertmaxrees: When I run my code I've discovered that I sometimes get on of these on the first dropdown list change, in the console    http://prntscr.com/4ngpul    Do you have any idea how I can debug it?
[12:36:26] <saucey> hey guys
[12:36:28] <TheLogan> That is, how I can track it down =)
[12:36:34] <TheLogan> evening saucey
[12:37:19] <saucey> i have tinymce, im trying to delete an image ive uploaded using justboil.me having a lot of trouble remove the file from the dir once ive deleted it from the editor
[12:38:38] <saucey> http://pastie.org/9559784
[12:43:01] <TheLogan> Sorry, can't help you there =)
[12:57:33] <dhskfdsfhlkadsf> hey all.
[12:57:40] <ortund> getting object doesn't support property or method on a div using .Show() ... wtf
[12:58:38] <dhskfdsfhlkadsf> Im having an issue. When I click on an element, it shows a loader, and loads in a new page via ajax. When I click the back button, it takes the user back to the previous page, but with the state of the loader being infinitely visible until the user either refreshes or clicks to another page.
[12:58:47] <dhskfdsfhlkadsf> this is only happening in Firefox
[12:58:52] <dhskfdsfhlkadsf> any ideas?
[12:59:27] <ortund> guys, I'm getting Object doesn't support property or method error on line 24... any ideas? -> http://pastebin.com/86NGuRs4
[13:01:02] <BillCriswell> ortund: .show(), not .Show()
[13:01:36] <ortund> BillCriswell, its case sensitive?
[13:01:40] <BillCriswell> yes.
[13:02:38] <ortund> kinda lame I got that wrong actually :/
[13:08:33] <BillCriswell> ortund: What did you get wrong?
[13:10:20] <ortund> BillCriswell, the case sensitive thing
[13:10:28] <ortund> how could anyone forget that?
[13:11:28] <dmsuperman> Windows background
[13:11:29] <dmsuperman> :P
[13:13:44] <BillCriswell> Happens.
[13:13:49] <BillCriswell> I've fucked up a lot simpler I'm sure.
[13:20:38] <saucey> DOMNodeRemoved doesnt work in all browser
[13:20:51] <saucey> what do i use?
[13:22:14] <dmsuperman> a Mutation Observer I think
[13:22:32] <saucey> you can an example?
[13:23:52] <Cork> neither is supported in all browsers
[13:24:06] <Cork> domnoderemoved and company is deprecated
[13:24:17] <Cork> mutationobservers is the replacement
[13:24:36] <Cork> but it is very new and doesn't have very good support yet
[13:25:05] <Cork> only option for the moment if you need cross browser support is to not rely on the dom to tell you about this
[13:25:23] <saucey> i see
[13:25:31] <Cork> meaning callbacks from the one removing the node in this case
[13:25:42] <robertlunch> lol saucey i told you what you should do earlier.
[13:26:09] <saucey> basically im using tinymce, and i need it to trigger when an image has been removed
[13:26:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah, do it in the click event of the image removal.
[13:26:27] <saucey> sorry robertlunch i missed it
[13:28:16] <saucey> so when image is click then remove the image
[13:28:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:28:29] <saucey> what if the users hit delete, or backspace
[13:28:46] <DobreJoe> How can I check each of the values of the following selector: $('[data-required="yes"]').val() ?
[13:28:50] <Cork> then you would have a key event
[13:29:07] <robertmaxrees> DobreJoe don't select on data attributes :(
[13:29:17] <robertmaxrees> but if you have to, .eac()
[13:29:20] <robertmaxrees> *each()
[13:29:30] <saucey> yes but how would i get that key event to only work on the image element and not the text?
[13:29:30] <Cork> DobreJoe: $.map($('[data-required="yes"]'), function(elm) { return $(elm).val() });
[13:29:33] <DobreJoe> robertmaxrees: thanks, what would be the alternative?
[13:29:41] <robertmaxrees> DobreJoe add a class.
[13:29:43] <DobreJoe> Cork: will try that
[13:29:57] <robertmaxrees> $('.myInputs').each(function() { console.log($(this).val()) }); will work, too.
[13:30:09] <Cork> and ya, if you need yes/no a class sounds like what you should use
[13:30:17] <DobreJoe> thanks !
[13:30:32] <Cork> the first gives you an array
[13:30:35] <Cork> the later a loop
[13:30:54] <Cork> so depending on what you need
[13:31:01] <saucey> how do i trigger on key events on the image only?
[13:31:24] <robertmaxrees> saucey you don't.  you check if the thing that was just removed was an image.
[13:31:42] <Cork> saucey: $('tinyme-element').on('keyup', 'img')
[13:31:45] <saucey> yes thats what ive been trying to do
[13:32:03] <Cork> should work
[13:32:20] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[13:32:20] <Cork> as elements gets focus in contenteditable
[13:32:33] <saucey> i see thanks
[13:32:36] <robertmaxrees> aaah, yeah tinymce must be using contenteditable.
[13:32:40] <Cork> though untested code :)
[13:33:40] <Cork> all web wysiwyg editors depend on contenteditable
[13:33:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we use it here.
[13:33:58] <robertmaxrees> i just wasn't thinking about it.
[13:34:12] <Cork> what is fun is that many don't know it is a feature about as old as iframes :D
[13:34:25] <Cork> i've seen ppl talk about it as a new feature
[13:34:54] <NoiseEee> it hasn't really improved or been touched since iframes as well
[13:34:55] <Cork> though it is dead old, just speced in whatwg a little back
[13:35:17] <Cork> well ya sure
[13:35:23] <NoiseEee> each browser tends to do its own style of 'markup' which can suck
[13:35:48] <NoiseEee> that being said, i just ran across http://jakiestfu.github.io/Medium.js/docs/ and plan to use it in a project
[13:35:48] <onenine90> When you console.log(anObject); you are able to use the Chrome console to expand all properties and really explore the object. How can I do this in the web page, for the end user? Are there any plugins?
[13:36:14] <Cork> NoiseEee: csswg and whatwg is doing a lot to normalize the web though
[13:36:19] <Cork> so it IS getting better
[13:36:26] <NoiseEee> Cork: yes in theory :)
[13:36:35] <Cork> it practice
[13:36:45] <Cork> follow the mailing lists if you don't trust me :)
[13:37:15] <Cork> and shocking enough; ms is on the forefront now days :)
[13:37:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:37:29] <robertmaxrees> they've really picked their game up.
[13:37:34] <Cork> and apple is the black sheep
[13:37:39] <Cork> ya
[13:37:51] <robertmaxrees> dave methvin wrote a fantastic blog post about the issues with webkit a while ago.
[13:37:52] <Cork> if you cut off ie at ie10
[13:38:03] <Cork> the browser is actually quite nice
[13:38:46] <Cork> robertmaxrees: ya, and sadly google has there own problems
[13:39:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:39:18] <Cork> where large parts of the browser department circumvent the commitment blink made when they forked
[13:39:19] <robertmaxrees> and i'm personally getting tired of the old IE hate.
[13:39:34] <Cork> well they did deserve it
[13:39:39] <Cork> they don't anymore
[13:39:53] <robertmaxrees> like, yeah they're not great browsers, but we don't say "firefox is great as long as you ignore 4 and prior"
[13:40:21] <Cork> cause it was still ok to develop for
[13:40:31] <Cork> i'm actually ok with supporting ff3+
[13:40:34] <robertmaxrees> iirc jquery core has more fixes for webkit than IE at this point.
[13:40:46] <Cork> ya
[13:40:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd disagree.  i had about as easy of a time with ie8+ than anything else.
[13:40:56] <Cork> mainly cause apple don't want to fix bugs
[13:41:16] <ortund> how do I check if a hyperlink's text is a certain value? $("a#lnkMoreDetail").click{function() { if ($(this).text == "More Detail") { $(this).text("Less Detail"); } ...
[13:41:18] <Cork> robertmaxrees: if you ever needed to touch opacity and png...
[13:41:30] <Cork> ie8 makes you cry
[13:41:38] <Cork> and events sucks in pre ie10
[13:41:40] <robertmaxrees> sure have - graceful degredation :)
[13:41:42] <fuse405> can someone have a look at http://scsys.co.uk:8002/423981
[13:41:44] <ortund> Cork,  ie anything makes anyone cry
[13:41:57] <robertmaxrees> ortund i like IE :)
[13:41:59] <Cork> ortund: ... looks like you missed the start
[13:42:03] <robertmaxrees> and $(this).text()
[13:42:51] <ortund> robertmaxrees, omg I'm so rusty :'(
[13:43:08] <robertmaxrees> ortund also, don't do  $("a#lnkMoreDetail") - just do  $("#lnkMoreDetail")
[13:43:16] <robertmaxrees> the former introduces unnecessary overhead.
[13:44:06] <Cork> i really would like to know what tutorial ppl is getting the <tagname>#<id> syntax from
[13:44:13] <robertmaxrees> CSS.
[13:44:20] <Cork> it is WAY to common to see it to not be a tutorial error
[13:44:26] <obert> hehe
[13:44:38] <Cork> robertmaxrees: the selectors in jquery is css sure
[13:44:48] <Cork> but someone is telling them to put tab names infront of ids
[13:45:00] <obert> thats wrong
[13:45:00] <Cork> and a good tutorial shouldn't do that
[13:45:11] <robertmaxrees> right, i'm saying that it's a habit people pick up from doing CSS.
[13:45:18] <obert> it would be better to don't use selectors
[13:45:20] <robertmaxrees> bad naming.
[13:45:23] <Cork> robertmaxrees: no it is just as bad in css
[13:45:28] <robertmaxrees> Cork i'm aware.
[13:45:42] <Cork> robertmaxrees: and you don't "pickup" bad selectors from css
[13:45:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying it's a good thing.
[13:45:44] <ortund> robertmaxrees, I did it that way purely for IRC so as to make sure you guys know what control I'm working with ;)
[13:45:49] <Cork> you have to learn it from somewhere
[13:46:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying it's people that do poor naming conventins because they think it makes it more readable.
[13:46:09] <Cork> ya
[13:46:15] <robertmaxrees> in my experience, it's designers who picked up programming.
[13:46:28] <robertmaxrees> i see stuff like that all the time from those guys.
[13:46:30] <Cork> i've had a few say they thought it was faster the more specific you where too
[13:46:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:46:49] <Cork> and that is wrong in a scary way
[13:46:50] <obert> infact i should drop the option to add selectors in front in my pycsser:P
[13:46:54] <robertmaxrees> the "it just works" mentality.
[13:47:02] <Cork> ya
[13:48:53] <obert> to all the interested people ;) http://csser.alwaysdata.net/
[13:49:31] <Cork> body > main > div + div + div > div > article > p + p + p + #Description
[13:49:35] <Cork> yay! :D
[13:49:57] <robertmaxrees> obert yeah i'd drop that option if you can.
[13:50:17] <obert> robertmaxrees: i surely can, but i will not perhaps
[13:50:34] <obert> robertmaxrees: so i can share that i can build a checkbox :)
[13:50:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:50:54] <obert> robertmaxrees: it was my first py project
[13:51:06] <obert> wrote it to learn it
[13:51:31] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[13:51:39] <obert> robertmaxrees: do you think that could be helpful to the whole single app, if i drop those 5 lines?
[13:51:47] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:51:57] <obert> i will consider it then, thank you
[13:52:14] <robertmaxrees> make the tool do one thing, and do it as well as it can.  prepending tags on css selectors is something you shouldn't really be doing.
[13:52:35] <robertmaxrees> having it in the app to show that you can do it is kind of strange, though I think I get where you're coming from.
[13:54:53] <onenine90> When you console.log(anObject); you are able to use the Chrome console to expand all properties and really explore the object. How can I do this in the web page, for the end user? Are there any plugins?
[13:55:30] <robertmaxrees> onenine90 not that i know of.  what's the use case?
[13:56:45] <ortund> okay so $("#modalBackground").display("block"); isn't working now either :(
[13:58:14] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[13:58:36] <BillCriswell> ortund: .css('display', 'block')
[13:59:04] <BillCriswell> onenine90: I think you want console.dir() ?
[13:59:22] <robertmaxrees> they want something to traverse objects in the page itself
[13:59:45] <ortund> BillCriswell,  fml... I'm such a noob... I KNOW this stuff even :(
[14:00:23] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I blame it being 5:00 on my inability to read.
[14:00:29] <robertmaxrees> it's all goo.
[14:00:32] <robertmaxrees> *good
[14:02:10] <Respek> ortund: don't get too frustrated. one must channel zen to avoid using too much of their cognitive resources, at least that what usually depletes me
[14:02:42] <Respek> also, keep an eye out for the problems I have, that'll definitely keep your ego up at least :)
[14:02:52] <Respek> they're waay simpler
[14:03:33] <onenine90> @robertmaxrees - trying to display the entire contents of this object to someone in finance department, without them having to go to console and do it
[14:03:59] <ortund> Respek, I think it comes from using cognitive resources all day lol
[14:04:42] <Respek> you know, the area of the brain responsible for willpower, and the area responsible for problem solving are actually the same place?
[14:05:23] <robertmaxrees> onenine90 btw if you drop the @ in front of people's usernames their clients are more likely to autonotify them that they were mentioned.
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> onenine90 you could .toSource() or convert it to a JSON string.
[14:08:00] <obert> robertmaxrees: where i coming from?:)
[14:08:14] <obert> robertmaxrees: anyway you got a point indeed
[14:08:34] <obert> also it is an useless option/rare one
[14:08:43] <robertmaxrees> what is?
[14:09:08] <obert> robertmaxrees: what is what?:)
[14:09:15] <robertmaxrees> what's a useless option?
[14:09:33] <obert> that 'add selector in front '
[14:09:42] <robertmaxrees> okay
[14:10:06] <obert> you convinced me, then. thank you
[14:11:13] <saucey> hey guys ive got the keydown event working
[14:11:22] <onenine90> robertmaxrees - sry, i'm used to Slack
[14:12:03] <saucey> i need need to figure out which item has been deleted how do i do this?
[14:12:38] <robertmaxrees> saucey have you tried using tinyMCE's support at all?
[14:12:55] <saucey> yea ive looked
[14:13:08] <saucey> they dont even offer a simple image upload
[14:13:09] <robertmaxrees> 'cause it really sounds like you should be asking them at their forum.
[14:13:15] <saucey> i had to download justboil.me
[14:13:33] <saucey> the plugin
[14:13:39] <saucey> for tinymce
[14:13:50] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need support for tinymce.
[14:13:57] <saucey> ok
[14:14:28] <onenine90> robertmaxrees - toSource() doesn't really help. The point is I want them to be able to expand or close certain sub-objects
[14:14:32] <onenine90> within the browser window
[14:14:35] <onenine90> not having to use the console
[14:14:39] <robertmaxrees> onenine90 i don't know of anything ready made to do that.
[14:14:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm giving you ideas of things you could play with
[14:14:55] <onenine90> ok
[14:14:57] <onenine90> any other ideas?
[14:15:56] <onenine90> how about this.. displaying it in formatted json
[14:16:05] <onenine90> so at least they can see everything it contains
[14:16:14] <onenine90> disregard the whole ability to expand or close things
[14:16:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:16:37] <onenine90> toSource() how do I get that to be formatted in a way that doesn't look like one big string
[14:16:42] <onenine90> but rather, tab delimited, easy to see
[14:17:00] <robertmaxrees> you don't without doing it yourself.
[14:17:41] <robertmaxrees> you could build a recursive function that'll do it for you.
[14:18:07] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/5523967/923919
[14:18:09] <robertmaxrees> try this.

[14:41:22] <saucey> the keyup down respond on the image can someone be kind enough to take a look
[14:41:30] <Blitty> Are there some way of to format to currency one string with jquery?
[14:41:33] <Blitty> natively
[14:58:40] <__joshua_____> Blitty: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString
[14:58:49] <__joshua_____> currency is one of the options
[15:00:39] <robertmaxrees> if IE 10 and below don't matter.
[15:04:28] <tandroid> When does ie 10 and below not matter?
[15:07:22] <robertmaxrees> eeexactly.
[15:07:28] <robertmaxrees> (when you really don't care.
[15:42:51] <delboy1978uk> i saw an ajax file upload blog, and i’m wondering does the ajax have to call upon submit, or can you do it earlier, ie when the file is chosen from the browse dialogue? here’s what i’m using, I seem to get a blank 200 from my upload url but i dont think the file is being sent? http://pastie.org/9560276
[15:52:42] <SOSA_> Hi
[15:52:55] <SOSA_> I need some urgant help
[15:53:13] <robertmaxrees> what do you need?
[15:53:15] <SOSA_> this project is for my new job and im only day 3 and now its unbillable until I finish it
[15:53:16] <SOSA_> Okay
[15:53:44] <SOSA_> I'm really stressed and I' really need the help, it would mean the world to me if you can.
[15:53:45] <SOSA_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25878825/form-doesnt-show-after-hding
[15:53:59] <SOSA_> I can post my full JS here.
[15:54:07] <SOSA_> pretty good comments.
[15:55:11] <SOSA_> The guy is giving me a chance and I can't even finish a simple web app. God damnit I need this job :(
[15:55:19] <robertmaxrees> slow your shit.
[15:55:33] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[15:55:34] <SOSA_> Huh?
[15:55:38] <SOSA_> Okay
[15:55:41] <robertmaxrees> in simmple terms
[15:56:31] <SOSA_> form is being cloned, inserted again. works, but then also hidden, then shown again, but it will not .show() after being hidden.
[15:56:44] <robertmaxrees> how are you trying to .show() it?
[15:56:47] <SOSA_> May  I post my full JS code?
[15:57:10] <robertmaxrees> hold up - what are you running .show() against?
[15:57:13] <SOSA_> when the ajax is complete.
[15:57:21] <SOSA_> The form, which is..
[15:57:31] <SOSA_> #analyze-results-form
[15:57:46] <robertmaxrees> your JS shows you running that before the ajax completes.
[15:57:48] <SOSA_> I can also zip and send the app for you to test.
[15:57:57] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[15:58:00] <SOSA_> Yeah I been trying quite a few ways
[15:58:05] <SOSA_> none of it works.
[15:58:15] <robertmaxrees> put $('#analyze-results-form').show(); after all your other logic in your complete callback.
[15:58:23] <SOSA_> Ok
[15:58:34] <SOSA_> Thank you very much for helping, I'm stressed
[15:58:46] <robertmaxrees> it's fine.  breathe a sec and it'll be ok.
[15:59:27] <robertmaxrees> you're not duplicating IDs at all, right?
[16:00:00] <SOSA_> No
[16:00:12] <robertmaxrees> then what's the story with tickerResultsFormClone = $('#analyze-results-form').clone(); ?
[16:00:12] <SOSA_> I will be uploading this to my server so you can see a live version, give me a second please.
[16:00:20] <SOSA_> Oh
[16:00:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah if I can see a copy of this with reproduction steps, that'd be easiest.
[16:00:58] <hal3> How can I make a webpage so that when someone refreshes my page, right before they do I can execute a javascript function. Similar to how people do this to give users alerts when they try and refresh their page.
[16:01:15] <hal3> Only I want it to execute a js function instead.
[16:01:30] <robertmaxrees> hal3 there are a few ways, but there's no guarantee that the function will run.
[16:01:53] <SOSA_> because two views actually take the entire parent container of #PickHolder and removes the content - this is a solution so I can finish quickly. The form is duped before that happens and put back in place after the wipe.
[16:02:16] <robertmaxrees> SOSA_ it sounds like you're doing some really strange things.
[16:02:27] <SOSA_> Probably
[16:02:29] <robertmaxrees> hal3 please do not PM me.  thanks!
[16:02:35] <hal3> sorry i didnt mean it
[16:02:38] <SOSA_> Let me upload it to the server. One sec.
[16:02:43] <Vorspire> SOSA_ my first guess: tickerForm = $('#analyze-form')
[16:02:49] <hal3> robertmaxrees what did you mean?
[16:02:54] <Vorspire> that id doesn't exist as far as i can see
[16:02:56] <robertmaxrees> hal3 when the page reloads/goes somewhere else, the page stops executing javascript.
[16:03:07] <hal3> ok but somthing like
[16:03:14] <hal3> <script>window.onbeforeunload=function(){return"hi"}</script>
[16:03:18] <hal3> will throw up an alert
[16:03:22] <hal3> when someone clicks refresh
[16:03:32] <robertmaxrees> sure, which is annoying, but the alert halts page execution.
[16:03:38] <robertmaxrees> nothing else can happen until that alert goes away.
[16:03:40] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[16:03:49] <hal3> i want to execute a javascript function
[16:03:52] <hal3> instead of an alert
[16:03:54] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:04:02] <robertmaxrees> what does this function do for you?
[16:04:32] <hal3> basically
[16:04:45] <hal3> say im on page 1 and i have <script>window.history.pushState(null,null,"/page2.htm")</script>
[16:04:52] <hal3> it will display that pages url as page2
[16:04:57] <hal3> but with page1's contrent
[16:05:00] <hal3> content*
[16:05:02] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:05:06] <hal3> however when i click refresh
[16:05:12] <hal3> it will redisplay page2's content
[16:05:28] <robertmaxrees> you need to handle that state info on load.
[16:05:28] <hal3> i want it to redirect back to page1
[16:05:31] <hal3> when they click refresh
[16:05:33] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[16:05:39] <robertmaxrees> you need to change how your page works on load.
[16:05:51] <hal3> what do you mean?
[16:06:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to look at the URL and load the appropriate content.
[16:06:27] <SOSA_> robertmaxrees:  May I send you this link in a PM?
[16:06:36] <robertmaxrees> SOSA_ i'd rather you didn't.  others could help.
[16:06:38] <hal3> i found this
[16:06:38] <hal3> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9308336/execute-function-before-refresh
[16:06:42] <SOSA_> Okay
[16:06:44] <SOSA_> http://businesstent.net/stockzi/
[16:06:46] <hal3> but the only function
[16:06:46] <hal3> is return
[16:06:47] <Vorspire> [00:02:43] (Vorspire) SOSA_ my first guess: tickerForm = $('#analyze-form')
[16:06:50] <SOSA_> So this is how to get the error
[16:07:00] <Vorspire> no such id exists
[16:07:06] <robertmaxrees> hal3 you are not listening.
[16:07:15] <hal3> i don't understand
[16:07:18] <SOSA_> search "GOOG", then click the menu icon, click "Saved Picks", then  click home, then search GOOG again. No form on top.
[16:07:22] <robertmaxrees> hal3 read window.location.href in your js or redirect at the server level.
[16:07:42] <robertmaxrees> hal3 otherwise the browser is going to think you're trying to attach it by redirecting on reload via js.
[16:08:09] <hal3> i want the page to display the url of another page while keeping the first pages content, on refresh
[16:08:16] <hal3> it works on the first load
[16:08:25] <hal3> but when I refresh, since the url is changed
[16:08:27] <robertmaxrees> hal3 that is something you need to do at the server level, then.
[16:08:29] <hal3> it goes to the second one
[16:08:35] <robertmaxrees> you cannot redirect on refresh the way you want to.
[16:08:58] <hal3> unfortunately I cant do anything but use client side code
[16:09:02] <hal3> are you sure there is no way to do this
[16:09:15] <robertmaxrees> test it.
[16:09:47] <delboy1978uk> i’m trying to ajax upload as soon as a file gets selected but with limited success. any pointers? http://pastie.org/9560276
[16:10:41] <robertmaxrees> SOSA_ the parent container is hidden...
[16:11:00] <SOSA_> Man I wish I was better :(
[16:11:00] <SOSA_> I need this job and im here on day 3 and can't even do a redesign.
[16:11:00] <SOSA_> Hewanted it done in 14 hours...
[16:11:00] <SOSA_> Is that right, or do you think that's to low of hours to work on a redesign?
[16:11:11] <SOSA_> robertmaxrees: yes the form is hidden
[16:11:17] <SOSA_> right?
[16:11:23] <robertmaxrees> SOSA_ the form is a child of #home.
[16:11:29] <robertmaxrees> you have display: none; applied to .view
[16:11:31] <SOSA_> Oh no, not that one
[16:11:41] <SOSA_> There is a form in #PickerHolder
[16:12:09] <robertmaxrees> #analyze-results-form, right?
[16:13:37] <SOSA_> yes sir.
[16:14:14] <robertmaxrees> wait what did you say you're doing with $('#results-submit-ticker') ?
[16:14:38] <SOSA_> what should happen: the form is there after going menu>savedpicks>searching query>results
[16:15:10] <robertmaxrees> try this: $('body').on('touchstart click', '#results-submit-ticker', function(e)
[16:15:16] <robertmaxrees> instead of $('#results-submit-ticker').on('touchstart click', function(e){
[16:15:51] <__joshua_____> delegation ftw
[16:16:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that .show() isn't getting hit.
[16:16:40] <robertmaxrees> at all.
[16:18:01] <Vorspire> I take it #analyze-form is a part of the loaded uri data then, since it doesn't exist in the html you gave in the stack overflow example
[16:18:15] <SOSA_> any thoughts? I really did try to make my JS good quality, and not a bunch of hacks. I just don't see the problem.
[16:18:22] <robertmaxrees> SOSA_ i just gave you something to try.
[16:18:24] <robertmaxrees> try it.
[16:18:39] <SOSA_> Vorspire: , look at url - its there, but not related.
[16:18:43] <robertmaxrees> do $('body').on('touchstart click', '#results-submit-ticker', function(e){ instead of $('#results-submit-ticker').on('touchstart click', function(e){
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> your clone isn't working the way you think it is.
[16:19:19] <SOSA_> i actually had that before, since it made my whole app weird but that was before this happened
[16:19:22] <SOSA_> so ill try it again
[16:20:07] <robertmaxrees> SOSA_ the issue is you're moving elements around with a plain .clone() call.
[16:20:14] <robertmaxrees> that'll break your event bindings.
[16:20:36] <robertmaxrees> so use delegated listeners instead.
[16:21:14] <robertmaxrees> if that's not doable for whatever, reason, then use .clone(true)
[16:21:16] <SOSA_> Okay I did just edited the code with your suggestion and it didn't work - ill go ahead and upload this edit so you can see.
[16:23:33] <SOSA_> upploaded
[16:23:51] <robertmaxrees> oh dude...
[16:23:59] <robertmaxrees> you're re-ruinning getPickerData...
[16:24:06] <robertmaxrees> there's some jank going on in here.
[16:26:40] <robertmaxrees> you quoted 14 hours for an overhaul?
[16:26:51] <SOSA_> re-ruining?
[16:27:27] <robertmaxrees> your doAction stuff.
[16:27:45] <robertmaxrees> that does getPickerData()
[16:27:52] <robertmaxrees> which has event bindings in it.
[16:28:04] <SOSA_> He just said "redesign" and the files he sent me was a mess. js in the same file, inline html styles, and yeah - it's cool though, right now im trying to fix this and i only will get paid 14 hours fro it (13.50 for an hour) I just want to get this done so I can get more work
[16:28:20] <robertmaxrees> 14 hours is not nearly enough time for a full redesign duder.
[16:28:45] <robertmaxrees> none of your code that shows stuff ever gets hit btw.
[16:28:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd pull out your debugger and start stepping through your js line-by-line
[16:29:00] <SOSA_> Yeah I know, it's my first webdev job so I don't even care, I'm happy to not get paid for this. I just want it done
[16:29:15] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:29:33] <robertmaxrees> don't ever be happy to "not get paid" or get underpaid. you devalue the entire profession.
[16:29:50] <robertmaxrees> get out your debugger and start steppin' through your code.
[16:30:41] <SOSA_> what I mean is, this is my first job, honestly. First job ever. Only other job was a temp agency for a day. This is building my resume and having a better job later on. He expected 14 hours and since I'm new, I can understand that  that could've been done faster using his code but I chose ffor a full blwon redesign. it's my fault, so that's what I mean't
[16:30:42] <robertmaxrees> that one event binding isn't working probably because you're adding/removing things from the pages and using direct event bindings.
[16:31:09] <SOSA_> Ok
[16:31:59] <robertmaxrees> i know exactly what you meant - people without experience show up all the time saying they're just trying to get a better resume or whatever, but that still devalues the profession. respect yourself more than that :)  i'll step off my soapbox and guide you to learn to use a debugger.
[16:32:05] <robertmaxrees> that's about the only choice you have at this point.
[16:32:39] <SOSA_> really?
[16:32:43] <SOSA_> would mean alot if you could.
[16:32:51] <robertmaxrees> if I could what?
[16:32:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm at my own job duder.
[16:33:09] <SOSA_> help em figure out how to debug.
[16:33:13] <SOSA_> me*
[16:33:16] <robertmaxrees> also: look at line 82
[16:33:18] <robertmaxrees> of app.js
[16:33:33] <SOSA_> Ok
[16:33:42] <SOSA_> OH
[16:34:38] <SOSA_> Okay thanks, sadly that didn't change but nice catch :)
[16:34:49] <SOSA_> So what kind of debugger do I use?
[16:35:04] <SOSA_> Chrome extension? ST plugin? app?
[16:35:17] <robertmaxrees> chrome has one built-in.
[16:35:19] <robertmaxrees> so does FF.
[16:35:20] <robertmaxrees> and IE.
[16:35:56] <SOSA_> Oh, the console?
[16:36:00] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:36:02] <robertmaxrees> the debugger.
[16:36:03] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/ is a fantastic guide.
[16:36:30] <robertmaxrees> the debugger does FAR more than the console.  you can stop execution and manually step through things line-by-line
[16:36:56] <SOSA_> Thanks I'll read it now
[16:37:41] <robertmaxrees> in the future, if you're going to rewrite an entire app, give yourself at least a week, and even that might not be enough.
[16:39:07] <SOSA_> His app was seriously so simple, a few calls to a remote server and some JS inserts.  He wanted me to make it look pretty (I'm a designer as well) and so I tried, but  with the limit of having the entire production folder be 350kb or less I was limited and hope some cool css transitions and a different way of loading the data would be nice.
[16:39:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you way under bid.
[16:39:42] <robertmaxrees> by a lot.
[16:40:02] <SOSA_> So I guess that's why he expected 14 hours, because his was madly simple.
[16:40:13] <SOSA_> what do you mean
[16:40:17] <robertmaxrees> clients never tell you the time.
[16:40:20] <robertmaxrees> you tell them.
[16:40:20] <robertmaxrees> always.
[16:40:48] <robertmaxrees> and 14 hours is barely enough time to do a straight redesign.  and by "redesign" i mean "make things look different"
[16:40:59] <robertmaxrees> not "add transitions or other bits of logic"
[16:43:56] <SOSA_> well by clients, this is my boss as I am a contractor wtih them. Actually, he  tested/trained me for a differnt positon but I didn't make the cut, and I told him I really need this job to make  aliving and he gave me this one  - redesigns/front-end work (other was backend work) It's nice and im learning a lot. I understand because I'm still new and quite slow at this I'll have some unbillable hours to finish. But  to me that doesn't ma
[16:44:48] <SOSA_> he's a very good bakend programmer. his company is focused on ecommerce systems/modules/etc so he's  good... just wants it done fast I guess
[16:44:53] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're either not properly representing the spec to me, or you're getting taken advantage of.  or he has some pretty crazy expectations.
[16:44:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:45:11] <robertmaxrees> i work for a pretty large ecommerce company, so I'm coming from experience, too ;)
[16:47:28] <SOSA_> He believes I can grow fast, so I think that is why he set these expectations. To learn quick and and grow fast enough. I told him in 6 months I'd like to retry for that position so I'm actually "employed" and not a contractor and he said OK. Trying so hard to learn everything. My biggest weakpoint right now is being REALLY slow.
[16:47:43] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:49:34] <SOSA_> Ugh it's stresing though
[16:49:37] <SOSA_> So I read it
[16:59:12] <SOSA_> robertmaxrees: , still can't find the problem sadly :(
[16:59:32] <robertmaxrees> and you've stepped through using your debugger?
[16:59:41] <robertmaxrees> because this is a big part of learning.
[17:02:31] <SOSA_> I'm trying.
[17:02:41] <robertmaxrees> not saying you're not ;)
[17:06:57] <SOSA_> mayb e im just not understanidng it right
[17:07:00] <SOSA_> understanding
[17:07:47] <robertmaxrees> you see the issue, right?  that your event binding isn't actually being bound anywhere.
[17:08:31] <robertmaxrees> the only place I could find that you're running .show() on that element never actually runs.
[17:08:42] <robertmaxrees> so figure out why that binding isn't working.
[17:08:56] <SOSA_> yes i understand that.
[17:11:28] <SOSA_> I'm lost :(
[17:12:16] <robertmaxrees> literally you need to just step through every bit of code. if you're having a hard time using your debugger, start putting console logs everywhere to make sure things are running when you thing theyt are.
[17:12:18] <robertmaxrees> *they
[17:18:01] <SOSA_> consoles are everywhere,still can't figure it out :/ not even sure what to put. I also added the .show() code all over the place.
[17:18:12] <robertmaxrees> that means your selectors are bad.,
[17:18:34] <robertmaxrees> or you're not hitting paths you think you're hitting.
[17:19:11] <SOSA_> what you mean
[17:19:29] <robertmaxrees> your even binding is not correctly running.
[17:19:32] <robertmaxrees> dunno how else to phrase that.
[17:20:03] <robertmaxrees> $('body').on('touchstart click', '#results-submit-ticker', function(e){ this line isn't running.
[17:20:29] <SOSA_> I get that, t
[17:20:36] <SOSA_> oh
[17:20:39] <SOSA_> hm
[17:21:18] <robertmaxrees> also, return false; will break that delegated listener i pointed out earlier.
[17:22:01] <robertmaxrees> also also, var actions = $('.action'); doesn't magically update.
[17:22:09] <SOSA_> below doAcction?  Actualy pretty important for the app, it stops the page form doing another transition
[17:22:17] <SOSA_> Ohhh
[17:22:20] <SOSA_> Ha
[17:22:20] <robertmaxrees> use $('.actions') everywhere you're using the actions var, too.
[17:22:23] <SOSA_> Maybe that's why?
[17:22:29] <robertmaxrees> you're basically breaking all your event bindings.
[17:22:52] <robertmaxrees> if you want to prevent the default event action, use event.preventDefault();
[17:23:52] <SOSA_> That's not the default though, the default for this app is to go to viewHandler. the no-view, it's so it doesn't change view, like you see on the results page
[17:24:19] <robertmaxrees> that's irrelevant - don't do return false; to e.preventDefault();
[17:24:29] <robertmaxrees> or event.preventDefault() or whatever you've named the event opbject.
[17:25:04] <SOSA_> So replace return false with  e.preventDefault();? (e is the event )
[17:25:39] <robertmaxrees> you named the event object "event", so it'd be event.preventDefault(); in your case
[17:26:47] <SOSA_> Got it
[17:27:25] <SOSA_> sadly that didn't change a thing
[17:27:27] <SOSA_> hmm
[17:28:54] <SOSA_> OMG I THINK I FIXED IT
[17:28:58] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[17:29:36] <SOSA_> like you said, actions didn't update, so.... re-assign...
[17:29:41] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:29:48] <SOSA_> 				tickerResultsFormClone.prependTo(pickHolder); 				actions = $('.actions');
[17:29:53] <robertmaxrees> also, you'd do really well to link your js.
[17:29:59] <robertmaxrees> it's got a lot of problems.
[17:30:46] <SOSA_> I know using completel instead of success is one of them, that was copied and pasted from his code, but other problems? If you can help em optimize this, to impress my boss I would love you to death and beyond, and i mean help, not do it for me. Just advice.
[17:30:59] <SOSA_> help me*
[17:31:01] <robertmaxrees> actually you should use .done()
[17:31:05] <robertmaxrees> not complete or done
[17:31:07] <SOSA_> I got a cold, im sick so my typing just sucks right now
[17:32:16] <robertmaxrees> your doAction function is checking each conditional - use else ifs instead so it stops checking after it finds what it needs.
[17:32:37] <robertmaxrees> use var in front of variable names
[17:32:43] <robertmaxrees> var deletePick = function(phoneId, stock){, etc.
[17:33:08] <SOSA_> oh really
[17:33:10] <SOSA_> why the vars?
[17:33:11] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:33:14] <robertmaxrees> scoping.
[17:33:23] <robertmaxrees> also: wrap the whole in in an iife imo.
[17:34:18] <SOSA_> whole what?
[17:34:24] <robertmaxrees> *thing
[17:34:25] <robertmaxrees> all the code.
[17:34:29] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:34:49] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/o414sgz/
[17:35:23] <robertmaxrees> (that has some reorg and some syntax fixes btw.
[17:35:49] <robertmaxrees> your savePick function - you define a "ticker" argument, but then immediately define a ticker variable.
[17:36:32] <robertmaxrees> don't pass the variable in.
[17:36:34] <SOSA_> that was honestly copied and pasted from his code , and sadly I can't test it so I'm pretty much ignoring it right now
[17:36:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:37:10] <robertmaxrees> you can't try to fix stuff and then not follow through.
[17:37:23] <robertmaxrees> and actually, you're not passing ANY arguments when you call it.
[17:38:01] <robertmaxrees> savePick is going to be broken because you aren't giving it the data it needs.
[17:38:12] <robertmaxrees> don't need to be able to hit the ajax endpoint to see it doesn't work.
[17:38:17] <SOSA_> his was a regular function, and I can't get any data from it when trying to "save". This is a phonegap app and I "assume" it requires info phonegap can get and I can't (like phoneid) so I can't really do anyting about it.
[17:38:41] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense.
[17:38:42] <SOSA_> he said he'll work on that part.
[17:38:46] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:39:12] <SOSA_> His functions worked by inline JS, thus where those params came from
[17:39:21] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't make any sense, but ok.
[17:39:33] <SOSA_> I moved it to a single file and only got parts of it working that actually gave me data from the remote server
[17:39:56] <SOSA_> for example, "top picks" isnt giving me anything, unless im doing it wrong..
[17:40:02] <SOSA_> if you look at the menu
[17:40:28] <robertmaxrees> http://www.jshint.com/
[17:40:32] <TheAtomicGoose> i have oh-my-zsh installed. why would my theme only work if i manually source my .zshrc instead of as soon as i open a terminal window?
[17:40:33] <robertmaxrees> use this.
[17:40:42] <SOSA_> I can hardly think rgiht now so sorry lol. Damn this cold just came out of no where, mustve been the rather change.
[17:40:52] <SOSA_> weather*
[17:43:12] <SOSA_> Ugh I wish I could make this app look better, but the damn 350kb limikt :/ have so many ideas for it
[17:43:28] <robertmaxrees> focus on code quality first yo.
[17:43:31] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time.
[17:43:37] <SOSA_> I'm working on that :)
[17:43:58] <robertmaxrees> have no syntax errors, etc.
[17:44:01] <SOSA_> ...after i send him the working version so I can actually make some money ...
[17:44:09] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:47:18] <uskerine> hi, is it possible to do something when input and textareas change their value?
[17:47:40] <robertmaxrees> uskerine yes.  there are many different input events available.
[17:48:01] <uskerine> which would be the easiest one?
[17:48:10] <robertmaxrees> change
[17:48:21] <robertmaxrees> $('input').on('change', function() {});
[17:48:32] <uskerine> thanks
[17:50:17] <SOSA_> robertmaxrees: , thank you again. You're awesome.
[17:50:24] <SOSA_> So this is your job?
[17:50:28] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:50:33] <robertmaxrees> is what my job?
[17:50:42] <tw2113> babysitting us
[17:50:48] <robertmaxrees> hah, no.
[17:50:56] <SOSA_> i thought you menti that being here supportins your job.. or no? lol
[17:51:02] <SOSA_> Ha
[17:51:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:51:06] <robertmaxrees> i do this for mental breaks at work.
[17:51:25] <tw2113> you come here for the break? :P
[17:51:49] <robertmaxrees> lol, i do it throughout the day.  helps it go by faster and gives me mental breaks.
[17:51:58] <robertmaxrees> lots of short breaks throughout the day help me.
[17:52:05] <SOSA_> Do you think helping others has  made you become better as well?
[17:52:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:52:14] <robertmaxrees> definitely.  you learn a lot.
[17:52:31] <tw2113> what gets bad is when you get determined to solve someone else's issue
[17:52:56] <robertmaxrees> meh, folks refuse to listen sometimes and then start tossing out insults.
[17:53:16] <robertmaxrees> trying to get better about it though.
[17:53:42] <SOSA_> Well, for me - I'm grateful you're here and helped me as well as others. You're doing god's work son.
[17:53:53] <uskerine> according to latest social psychology studies helping others is positive for your own happiness
[17:53:53] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[17:54:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm only trying to give back to the community.,
[17:54:51] <robertmaxrees> 9/10, people really just need a rubber duck.
[17:56:02] <SOSA_> robertmaxrees:* duck.
[17:56:25] <robertmaxrees> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[17:58:38] <SOSA_> Wow, there is a term for that.
[17:58:44] <SOSA_> Had that happened quite a few times this week
[18:05:50] <uskerine>  .change does not react when you change item's content through another jQuery function (such as for example, a button which populates an <input> field)
[18:12:26] <SOSA_> Any advice on learning how to code faster?
[18:15:59] <ISmithers> If I bind a function to .click, before I bind a new function, do I need to unbind the old one?
[18:20:05] <ISmithers> Yes appears to be the answer to that.
[18:25:08] <__joshua_____> ISmither, yeah, its a list if using .on or .click or .addEventListener
[18:26:49] <ISmithers> Cool thanks __joshua_____ :>
[18:37:27] <uskerine> how could I reload the web page? window.location.href = "foo.html" won't request a new fresh foo.html if already in foo.html
[18:43:27] <uskerine> location.reload();
[20:11:46] <vinex08> hi, im not sure the name of the "effect or what"   https://squareup.com/
[20:12:02] <vinex08> scrool down youll see the play video
[20:27:07] <uskerine> hi, does anyone know how to check with firebug which item has the "tab"  now?
[20:27:20] <uskerine> (I mean when focus is moved around elements with TAB key)
[20:27:34] <DobreJoe> how do you I use the following expression in an if statement?: $('li.featured_image').has('img')
[20:28:15] <DobreJoe> it seems that always evaluates to true even when there are no img descendants
[20:30:21] <uskerine> .length
[20:30:33] <uskerine> $('li.featured_image').has('img').length
[20:30:34] <uskerine> ?
[20:31:03] <DobreJoe> uskerine: yeah! tnx
[20:45:33] <SOSA_> Hi guys, problem. Some of my content is loading, well, at-least it's not functionality correctly.
[20:47:12] <SOSA_> Anyone alive?
[20:47:40] <jpwillis> marginally
[20:48:25] <SOSA_> Okay, you up for helping?
[20:48:36] <jpwillis> i can try
[20:48:43] <SOSA_> Okay great
[20:48:45] <jpwillis> what's happening?
[20:49:28] <SOSA_> Go here, http://businesstent.net/stockzi/ search "GOOG" now search "AAPL" in the top results form.
[20:51:51] <SOSA_> app.js is where the broken magic is...
[20:52:35] <SOSA_> the js file kinda explains how much of it works. let me know if you dont get it though
[20:53:52] <SOSA_> line 127 is related to the second form
[20:55:20] <SOSA_> also on the .on it was suppose to be $('body') sorry.
[20:56:24] <SOSA_> justuploaded that fix.
[21:02:19] <SOSA_> So the content is there, it just isn't showing up
[21:06:18] <SOSA_> Figured out why it's happening :/
[21:12:47] <SOSA_> Question
[21:13:51] <SOSA_> So in my app, return false; stops the application from running a function that is after the if stateement in a certain case, however this return false also removes the click binding event, which breaks the app. Any way to solve this?
[21:14:06] <SOSA_> preventDefault() stilll runs the function after.
[21:20:17] <HikaruBG> hi guys
[21:20:48] <HikaruBG> I have the following task - to create basic image slider, wich will also be a part of a responsive design
[21:21:04] <HikaruBG> any ideas?
[21:45:46] <HikaruBG> hi guys
[21:45:57] <HikaruBG> anyone on the slider problem?
[22:24:51] <ruby_on_tails> how can i make my own .hide() function which i can apply to a jquery element and it performs some stuff and then moves on with the queue?
[22:25:16] <ruby_on_tails> i want this $("#myelement").performstunt().explode().hide();
[22:25:57] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you would write a jquery plugin
[22:26:28] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: so all jquery functions like .hide() .slideup() are actually plugins?
[22:26:57] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: kinda, but not really :)
[22:27:24] <ruby_on_tails> so why do i have to write a plugin why cant i do the 'not really plugin' thingy?
[22:27:42] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: cause a plugin is about adding those functions
[22:27:52] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[22:28:01] <Cork> the difference is that you might not need the portability wrappers
[22:28:11] <Cork> but for the rest; you need to write a plugin
[22:28:20] <Cork> and as the wrapper is just two lines...
[22:28:28] <ruby_on_tails> never written a plugin, no clue what portability wrappers is, can point to some easy tutorial or something?
[22:28:30] <Cork> that is why i said you need to write a plugin
[22:29:07] <Cork> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/
[22:35:18] <mukesh_> how to add condition in jquery tinymic editor plugin
[22:44:27] <HikaruBG> hi again guys!
[22:51:34] <HikaruBG> i have the following code: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8362949/    which have to rotate few images... but it gets to the last one and it stops. WHat is wrong with the code? How to make it rotate on exactly 3 sec?
[22:58:14] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: cant we use .animate() inside a jquery plugin?
[23:08:15] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you can
[23:09:16] <mukesh__> crok is there?
[23:11:12] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/7j00tkxa/ why does greenify doesnt work but redify does?
[23:11:34] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/7j00tkxa/1/ smaller code
[23:11:59] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: cause you can't animate colors without jquery ui
[23:12:12] <mukesh__>  help for tinymic jquery editor
[23:12:14] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: what?
[23:12:20] <ruby_on_tails> then what can i animate?
[23:12:32] <Cork> numbers
[23:12:40] <mukesh__> how to pass variable in jquery tinymce editor template with php condition

[23:25:28] <Kartagis> hrm
[23:25:48] <Kartagis> I have two textfields
[23:26:28] <Kartagis> I fill one of them in. and in console its .val() gives me undefined
[23:27:50] <Uhkis> wrong selector?
[23:32:58] <Kartagis> Uhkis: got the issue. jQuery(document).ready() { ... });
[23:33:03] <Kartagis> was lacking
[23:36:05] <Kartagis> what do I need to read to make 3000 3.000 as I type? I know it's .keyup for as-I-type part
[23:39:20] <Cork> Kartagis: the input event
[23:40:04] <oleole> Hey. Is there an easy way to read transform: matrix(xx,xx,xx,xx) values in jQuery?
[23:40:45] <Lebbe> why would you want to do that in jquery
[23:42:35] <Kartagis> Cork: hmm, what's the difference between keyup and input?
[23:42:57] <Cork> Kartagis: the question is rather: what is the difference between keydown and input
[23:43:20] <Kartagis> what is the difference between keydown and input?
[23:43:23] <Cork> and in keydown you get notified before the character has been entered into the input field
[23:43:30] <oleole> Lebbe: Because jQuery is my primary library
[23:43:33] <Cork> while input fires after
[23:43:43] <oleole> Lebbe: Do you know if it’s possible in “raw” JS then?
[23:43:45] <Cork> some control keys doens't fire input
[23:43:49] <Cork> that is about it
[23:44:02] <Kartagis> Cork: so, character counters use input event?
[23:44:26] <Cork> oleole: you would have to parse it either yourself, or find a plugin that does
[23:44:39] <Cork> Kartagis: sadly many don't
[23:44:42] <Cork> but they should
[23:45:21] <Kartagis> hrm
[23:45:23] <oleole> Cork: That’s what I thought…
[23:45:26] <oleole> But thanks anyways :)
[23:45:41] <Cork> oleole: i'm sure you can find one if you look
[23:46:39] <Kartagis> you know what I mean by character counter, right? I may not have used the correct term. you know, number of characters are subtracted from a fixed number as you type?
[23:46:44] <Kartagis> Cork: ^
[23:46:57] <Cork> Kartagis: ya, i got what you meant
[23:47:03] <Kartagis> okay
[23:47:12] <Cork> Kartagis: many use keyup, but that means they count wrong if you hold down the key
[23:47:23] <Cork> or they use keyup
[23:47:44] <Cork> but then they have to have A LOT of code to figure out what the latest key change would do
[23:47:59] <Cork> (was it a delete? what character would it remove?)
