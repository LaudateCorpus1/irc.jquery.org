[04:39:00] <saltlake> <a href="site.com?id=5">click</a>
[04:39:06] <saltlake> it's $_GET

[11:34:01] <bigode> Hey guys, could someone help me figure why the span class h is hiding when I click a menu item please: https://codepen.io/0rf30/pen/bMExXa ?
[11:38:53] <shoky> bigode: because you're setting it to an empty value. .style.top is empty. maybe you want  $('.wrap').offset().top  though it stays at 0
[12:38:18] <bigode> shoky: how about if I use document.querySelector('html, body').style.top ?
[12:58:42] <bigode> shoky: yes, .offset().top keeps value 0
[12:59:14] <bigode> I wonder which var position are being updated?
[12:59:29] <bigode> https://codepen.io/0rf30/pen/bMExXa
[13:00:01] <bigode> I did change to document.querySelector("html, body").offset().top
[13:02:19] <shoky> bigode: you're updating <html>'s .scrollTop
[13:02:53] <shoky> might be <body>'s instead depending on browser, not suer
[13:06:42] <bigode> shoky: I got it. Thank you shoky! ;)
[15:00:42] <capr4> hey guys - I'm having trouble with this tooltip. It seems to be triggering mouseenter and mouseleave repeatedly - https://jsfiddle.net/o72huky6/
