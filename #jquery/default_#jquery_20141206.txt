[00:14:05] <gh0st> I’m trying to implement jquery-file-upload (https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) in a custom way and for the life of me can’t get much help on stackoverflow given (what I thought) was a pretty good explanation of my problem. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27074087/customizing-the-jquery-file-upload-basic-plugin  Can anyone here help?
[00:14:50] <gh0st> I also realize that this may not be entirely a jQuery issue but I figure this might be the best place to start.
[00:15:21] <gh0st> Or perhaps this is the wrong route i’m trying to utilize in the first place.
[02:16:07] <Duvdevan> Robdgreat maybe that element isn't found anywhere in the document

[06:23:48] <solars> hey, does anyone know a plugin/lib that let's me display a status indicator like this: http://team.dev-gears.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/nest-stock-image-1.png (status is on the outer indicator, custom text in the middle)
[06:24:36] <SirLagz> solars: the clock like indicator ?
[06:25:59] <solars> SirLagz, yes
[06:26:16] <solars> I need a percentage on the outer ring, a custom text in the inner
[06:26:26] <SirLagz> http://www.jqueryscript.net/chart-graph/Animated-Donut-Chart-Plugin-with-jQuery-Canvas-DoughnutIt.html  <-- similar to that ?
[06:27:53] <solars> I think so, yes
[06:27:59] <solars> but I don't need an animation
[06:28:37] <SirLagz> you can probably turn off the animation
[06:28:52] <SirLagz> morris.js also has donut charts that you might be able to use
[06:29:23] <solars> thanks a lot
[06:29:25] <solars> I'll try it
[06:29:48] <SirLagz> solars: no problems

[07:18:13] <SuperTyp> hi guys, I am using jQuery UI Layout and I want not a center panel to have scrollbars but the body instead. I have no idea how to do it....
[07:23:04] <SuperTyp> this is the layout for now: http://jsfiddle.net/r2x3j4yc/
[07:23:47] <SuperTyp> you see the center panel has horizontal scrollbars. This causes problems with the mouse position, it breaks :S
[07:23:55] <SuperTyp> (of canvas)
[07:38:03] <tincek> Hi, is it possible to dynamically add space between form elemnets, if they are too close to each other? So a function that I would call, that would calculate the distance between each form fields, and add space between them, if the distance is less than (for example) 10px?
[07:39:56] <SuperTyp> sure tincek
[07:41:29] <tincek> SuperTyp: any ideas how this could be achievable? thanks in advance :)
[07:42:06] <SuperTyp> tincek: by comparing the offset of these elements
[07:43:10] <Tomashe> guys really i need ur help
[07:43:16] <Tomashe> guys i got a prob with jquer mobile, i load pages using ajax and handlebars and then run tigger('create') but it makes a mess in the page, from duplicate pages footers to problems with interface . anyone can help me out ? there is a way to initialize jquery on specific page every time i do load new data programticly?
[07:43:43] <tincek> SuperTyp: so like this:    $('.foo').offset().top - $('.bar').offset().top ?
[07:43:43] <Tomashe> for example i i have empty divs (pages) inside them i just load templates from handle bars and see the page. when i navigate that page at the first time all works great, problem happeneing when i clear the html of thatsame page and navigate to it again , when it looks like jquerymobile is not enchangement or something

[08:12:02] <tincek> SuperTyp: works like a charm, thank you for your help! :)
[08:12:16] <SuperTyp> tincek: yw
[08:17:35] <SuperTyp> Tomashe: provide some code, like this nobody will help you (I have no exp. with jQ Mobile though)
[08:48:00] <introom> hi. a noob question.
[08:48:06] <introom> what's the result of "jQuery( "[attribute*='value']" )"
[08:48:13] <introom> is that a dom element?
[08:48:17] <arthurvr> nope
[08:48:21] <arthurvr> it’s an attribute selector
[08:48:37] <introom> can I play with it interactively?
[08:48:52] * introom thinks maybe ff console could do that.
[08:49:09] <introom> arthurvr: the pages seems doesn't doc it what the function returns:http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[08:49:24] <arthurvr> It will return all elements with with the ‘attribute’  attribute and the string ’value’ in its value
[08:50:03] <arthurvr> ”Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing a given substring.”
[08:50:44] <arthurvr> It returns a set of elements
[08:50:47] <introom> arthurvr: yeah. but I dunno how the element is wrapped by jquery. is it a list, what's the wrapped element inside the list.
[08:50:50] <arthurvr> Like every $() call
[08:51:19] <introom> arthurvr: can I interactively play with jquery?
[08:51:33] <arthurvr> What do you understand of interactivity? It’s just a selector.
[08:51:42] <introom> I think this sorta question could be quickly solved if I can see the result.
[08:51:56] <arthurvr> I’il fiddle something
[08:52:01] <introom> Like, selecting something and see if I select correctly.
[08:52:08] <introom> aha. fiddle.
[08:52:28] <arthurvr> yeah but that’s not the funciton of this selector
[08:54:31] <arthurvr> This is how it works man http://jsfiddle.net/nge89upu/
[08:54:45] <arthurvr> still don’t understand what you mean by ”interactive”
[08:54:57] <arthurvr> it isn’t an event or so
[08:56:33] <introom> araujo: by "interactive", I mean, I want to learn jquery in an interactive way. Not related with the semantic of selector.
[09:12:01] <BillCriswell> introom: http://flukeout.github.io/ might be interesting to you
[09:12:16] <Bryzzle> Hey bill
[09:12:22] <BillCriswell> Took me a while to dig it up but I finally found it.
[09:12:25] <BillCriswell> Bryzzle: Howdy.
[09:12:31] <Bryzzle> I have a quick random question, how can i remove all the connections so i don't see them
[09:12:48] <Bryzzle> I was on mac before, and it did it automatically ;)
[09:13:07] <BillCriswell> In IRC?
[09:13:26] <Bryzzle> Yes
[09:13:43] <_rgn> introom: put a bunch of tags in html document, load jquery and use $ in console
[09:13:51] <introom> BillCriswell: yeah. cool. But I am just getting myself re-familiar with jquery. It's been 4 yrs or so I haven't touched it.
[09:14:02] <_rgn> there's your interactive repl for trying stuff out
[09:14:07] <introom> _rgn: I just tried firebug with firebug_jquery.
[09:14:11] <BillCriswell> introom: The selectors are pretty much just CSS.
[09:14:12] <introom> that's cool.
[09:14:53] <introom> BillCriswell: I am more interested in, what kinda of object does the selector return, and what method I can invoke on them.
[09:16:23] <_rgn> most of what you see on api.jquery.com
[09:17:26] <BillCriswell> In the console you can do like: var a = $('a'); a.[Then lists of methods will show up]
[09:17:35] <BillCriswell> I bet an interactive way can be fun.
[09:18:26] <SuperTyp> Bryzzle: click the IRC symbol click options click "Hide JOINS/PARTS/QUITS:"
[09:18:42] <BillCriswell> Bryzzle: Which client?
[09:19:11] <Bryzzle> mirc
[09:19:16] <introom> BillCriswell: another question. I'd like to see the value of my var. but seems like in js, the assignment returns "undefined"
[09:19:30] <BillCriswell> introom: console.log(someVar)
[09:19:32] <introom> so I have to put my var in a separate newline, kinda cumbersome.
[09:19:56] <introom> oh. that's more trivial then, var a = myvar; myvar;
[09:21:28] <SuperTyp> Bryzzle: sorry, I thought you talk about the web client. Hope this helps you: http://wiki.xkcd.com/irc/Hide_join_part_messages
[09:22:38] <Bryzzle> @SuperTyp thanks man , i found it too, i appreciate it
[09:22:51] <Bryzzle> You were helpful
[09:23:10] <introom> hi.
[09:23:34] <SuperTyp> I have a problem with jQuery UI Layout plugin: I want the nested center panel not to have scrollbars: http://jsfiddle.net/r2x3j4yc/
[09:23:35] <introom> My primary goal is, when the user clicks the "reply" button on gmail web interface, my function will be invoked.
[09:23:48] <introom> I think, I shall first register my funciton on that button.
[09:24:11] <introom> but that function doesn't always appear. It only appears after I click a certain thread.
[09:24:26] <introom> so how do I register my function on that button (with jquery) ?
[09:25:31] <SuperTyp> introom: $("#IDofYourButton").click(function() {//yourCodeGoesHere});
[09:25:33] <BillCriswell> introom: You should probably read a beginning guide, but the function you're looking for is .on()
[09:25:57] <BillCriswell> $('#some-button').on('click', function () { console.log('You clicked #some-button'); });
[09:26:47] <SuperTyp> BillCriswell: why .on() and not .click()?
[09:27:14] <introom> BillCriswell: sorry for my vauge description.
[09:27:19] <introom> it's hard to find that button.
[09:27:23] <BillCriswell> Either will work. .click() calls .on() though.
[09:27:33] <introom> cause the gmail webinterface won't show that button by default.
[09:27:46] <introom> only after I click a mail, that thing will show up.
[09:28:08] <introom> BillCriswell: if you use gmail web interface, you will know what I mean.
[09:28:28] <BillCriswell> introom: I'm not looking for it haha.
[09:29:28] <SuperTyp> nobody with UI Layout exp. here?
[09:30:01] <BillCriswell> Right click the element in dev tools and "Copy CSS Path"
[09:30:27] <BillCriswell> Later everyone!
[09:30:42] <introom> BinaryKitten: everyone?
[09:30:49] <introom> you mean see you later?
[09:40:31] <SuperTyp> introom: are you trolling?
[09:42:10] <introom> SuperTyp: in what kind of sense do you see me trolling?
[10:46:09] <H1FuelCell> hey guys, when I use event.target.domElementName, how does jQuery go about locating domElement?
[10:46:21] <H1FuelCell> I was looking at the code here... https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js
[10:46:38] <H1FuelCell> but I'd like to ask if someone can point me to the getter code...
[10:47:55] <shoky> what's event.target.domElementName ?
[10:50:01] <shoky> anyway doesn't sound like something jquery itself is doing, event.target is just a native dom element, with whatever properties the browser puts in it. (e.g. in chrome and IE, a form element has properties for all its inputs, by name)
[10:50:55] <H1FuelCell> shoky: I came across this in a meteorjs book, so perhaps meteor is decorating the event object...
[10:51:35] <H1FuelCell> in that book, there is a form: <form><input name="playerName"><input type="submit"></form>
[10:51:36] <shoky> no idea about meteor
[10:51:57] <H1FuelCell> then in the click event handler, when I use event.target.playerName
[10:52:06] <shoky> and event.target is the form?  then it's what i said, form elements have properties for all their inputs, by name
[10:52:10] <H1FuelCell> it locates that input element
[10:52:13] <shoky> in chrome and IE. i don't think that'd work in firefox
[10:52:39] <H1FuelCell> ooh, didn't know that
[10:54:43] <H1FuelCell> shoky: it worked in FF too...
[10:54:59] <H1FuelCell> event.target.playerName.value
[10:56:21] <H1FuelCell> thing is, when I console.dir(event.target),  the __proto__ is HTMLFormElement
[10:56:33] <H1FuelCell> But I don't see the playerName field in the attributes in the console
[10:56:52] <H1FuelCell> it's there in the elements property
[10:57:26] <H1FuelCell> so how does the browser check in the 'elements' directly shoky?
[11:22:06] * CssNoob good night and good morning y'all
[11:29:11] <SuperTyp> hi guys, how can I set a container in jquery UI Layout to fit its content?
[11:29:47] <SuperTyp> display:block; and overflow: auto; makes the layout disappear
[11:30:50] <SuperTyp> http://jsfiddle.net/SuperTyp/r2x3j4yc/2/
[14:11:44] <soahccc> Has something changed with when().then() or am I to stupid to use it with $.ajax? The requests won't perform in parallel :( Code is from coffee, I apologize https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7f06136995cf0ca7dd99
[15:34:41] <damarusama> super newby question - do you have to keep the $(document).ready within your html page?
[15:52:47] <systemfault> No.
[15:55:15] <damarusama> I guess as long as I have to document ready script loading at the right position whitin my html page
[17:10:15] <AliG1000> Hi - how can I convert http://jsfiddle.net/x7k2m5re/1/ to a regular webpage?  I have tried, and failed.
[17:14:53] <AliG1000> is there a funeral on that I am not aware of?  It's ever so quiet in here...

[18:33:44] <spudzee> http://jsfiddle.net/m03xoaf1/
[18:34:12] <spudzee> how can I make it where, when thing is over block, it will make the bit of thing that is over block red
[18:36:27] <spudzee> I guess what I'm really asking is, is there an easier way of doing this than having a separate div whose height is determined by how far into block thing is?
[18:37:19] <spudzee> and having its color be blue
[18:37:40] <spudzee> and positioned on the screen exactly where thing is with the same height and everything
[18:37:56] <spudzee> actually come to think of it, that's not as hard as I imaged in would be
[18:38:03] <spudzee> nvm
[19:10:23] <kevireilly_> soahccc: I’m not familiar with the promises interface, but are you sure that you don’t need to do xhr.done or something? http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#jqXHR

[22:29:11] <VaticanCameos> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27340061/having-issues-with-typeahead-js-non-bootstrap would appreciate some pointers folks.
[22:34:47] <limbera> hey all
[22:34:55] <limbera> can someone please explain what this means to me " Session authentication is appropriate for AJAX clients that are running in the same session context as your website."
[22:35:03] <limbera> particularly what does "same session context as your website" imply
[22:35:06] <limbera> does that mean same IP???
[23:23:09] <aro_> i am using $.on('submit') on a form, which captures the submit and defers it.. it triggers a submit if successful - is there a way to prevent the .on from capturing the triggered submit?
[23:27:00] <introom> does $(document).ready guarantee all the script has already been parsed and evaluated?
[23:27:28] <introom> I understand the .ready event could be fird before the css, img are fully loaded.
[23:27:58] <introom> but, is it possible that, that event is fired before all javascript is loaded?
[23:28:29] <introom> hmm. IOW, when the DOM is ready, does that mean all the javascript has been parsed and evaluated?
