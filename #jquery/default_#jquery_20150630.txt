[00:01:51] <ycon_> Hi, I'm usin the "setTimeout" function without much success. Can someone direct me? http://jsfiddle.net/ajtevxaj/39/
[00:02:57] <Cork> ycon_: there isn't any setTimeout in the fiddle
[00:03:26] <ycon_> Ah I'll update- http://jsfiddle.net/ajtevxaj/40/
[00:03:29] <Cork> ycon_: also $(document).not(".search-field") <-- this one doesn't make sense
[00:04:38] <Cork> ycon_: there isn't any element with id="aap" in the page
[00:05:10] <monk3y> teamcoltra: sorry for the delay, but this might be handy; $(document) would work, but it's bad practice/inefficient.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9418991/when-using-jquery-on-why-use-document-vs-the-element-itself
[00:05:54] <Cork> monk3y: that isn't generically true actually
[00:06:15] <Cork> if you want the event handler on multiple elements it is much better to add a single event handler on a common parent
[00:06:32] <Cork> (for performance that is)
[00:10:13] <ycon_> Cork- would you suggest removing CSS from moving my search and keeping it all as jquery?
[00:12:11] <Cork> ycon_: nope
[00:12:20] <Cork> js should only control when things happen
[00:12:35] <Cork> how it looks should be in css
[00:12:38] <ycon_> Well I'm using CSS to make the search box 'pop' out
[00:12:56] <Cork> ya, that is "how it looks"
[00:13:53] <ycon_> So I should use CSS to 'close' the box too then I'm guessing
[00:14:04] <monk3y> Cork: alrighty then.  I've seen that analysis repeated several times without challenge, so I reference it.  Anywhere I can find a better reference/analysis?
[00:14:09] <Cork> well if you want to hide it, yes
[00:14:25] <Cork> if you want to remove the code completely, then no just .remove() in jquery
[00:16:08] <Cork> monk3y: this isn't jquery specific, and no i don't have a tutorial page explaining it
[00:16:29] <Cork> monk3y: but the dom gets slower for each event handler you add (even if you don't interact with the element with the handler)
[00:16:49] <Cork> monk3y: so if you can reduce the number of event handlers by adding a single handler that replaces a lot of them
[00:17:01] <ycon_> Cork: I only want the element to hide after 3 seconds have passed 'if' there is no text in the box. Is CSS capable of this?
[00:17:06] <Cork> you will get quite significant performance gains
[00:17:28] <Cork> ycon_: the click should be in js, the timer should too
[00:17:42] <Cork> but what js should do is add a class that triggers css to hide the element
[00:20:54] <ycon_> Cork: so I should create a class which hides my element- and get js to trigger that?
[00:21:02] <Cork> yes
[00:21:42] <ycon_> It can't just 'not' show a certain field?
[00:21:52] <ycon_> *class, no field
[00:22:01] <Cork> you can do .hide() on the element
[00:22:39] <Cork> but ya, i prefer keeping the code clean and having something like addClass('closed')
[00:25:47] <monk3y> Cork: yeah that makes sense (less handlers), but I think the link I pasted was talking about registering the handler with a closer parent div than document.  If you put more/all handlers on document, then *every* event bubbles through all elements up to it, whereas putting it on a closer parent limits the walk.  *shrug* I have tested _none_ of this, it's all theoretical and hazy memory.
[00:26:27] <Cork> monk3y: nope, the second version isn't delegated
[00:26:37] <Cork> the handlers are repeated on each element matching the selector
[00:29:04] <monk3y> Cork: ah yeah, that's why I thought it was more efficient - going with the original context of the post that the actual target element was getting its class set after-load - so instead of putting the handler on target.class, you put it on div#parent above that target.  So there's still only one unique selector (div#parent).. am I thinking 'good'?  heh.
[00:29:34] <monk3y> (please correct me if I'm overlooking something, I'm only 80% certain here)
[00:30:16] <Cork> monk3y: if you reduce the number of times the event handler has to be executed then sure you save some time
[00:30:34] <Cork> and beside that the number is what matters not where
[00:31:30] <beasty> morning Cork o/
[00:31:46] <Cork> o/
[00:31:54] <beasty> hows life?
[00:32:12] <monk3y> Cork: aiight!
[00:32:35] <Cork> fine
[00:59:00] <Macaveli> "http://www.remsis.dev/user/sign_up" how do I split this on the first "/"
[00:59:20] <Macaveli> tried something like this "good_luck_buddy".split(/_(.+)?/)[1] but replaing the "_" didn't work :)
[01:00:08] <Cork> var parser = document.createElement('a'); parser.href = "http://www.remsis.dev/user/sign_up"; parser.pathname
[01:02:17] <Cork> Macaveli: http://jsfiddle.net/owo9yxod/
[01:04:35] <Macaveli> Thanks corky
[01:56:03] <Xatenev> $(function() {
[01:56:03] <Xatenev> console.log("test");
[01:56:03] <Xatenev> });
[01:56:09] <Xatenev> shouldnt this print test on document ready? o>o
[01:56:30] <Cork> yes it should
[01:56:36] <Xatenev> it doesnt :O nothing is printed
[01:57:50] <Xatenev> why is nothing printed? o>o
[01:57:58] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/7drgcgsr/
[01:58:38] <Xatenev> Cork: what could stop this from logging anything to console?
[01:58:48] <Xatenev> Cause I have no idea where and what I could look for
[01:58:50] <Cork> code error?
[01:59:05] <Xatenev> well no error logged to console
[01:59:16] <Xatenev> and thats the only content i have in my JS
[01:59:18] <Xatenev> the JS is included
[01:59:29] <Uhkis> did you include jquery?
[01:59:32] <Xatenev> yea
[01:59:40] <Xatenev> if I remove the on document ready stuff
[01:59:41] <Xatenev> its printed btw
[01:59:59] <Xatenev> but i got jquery included :/
[02:00:10] <Xatenev> jquery-1.8.2.min.js
[02:01:22] <stangeland> what comes first? $(window).ready or $(document).ready ?
[02:01:53] <Xatenev> window
[02:02:35] <Xatenev> lopl WTf is happening
[02:02:39] <Xatenev> $(...).ready is not a function
[02:02:48] <Xatenev> but I just ran a test to check if jquery is loaded: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.de/2009/03/check-if-jqueryjs-is-loaded.html
[02:02:55] <Xatenev> it tells me its loaded
[02:03:01] <Cork> both
[02:03:11] <Cork> ready isn't a exactly an event
[02:03:15] <Cork> its a callback function
[02:03:20] <Cork> and you always get the same
[02:03:34] <Cork> though you shouldn't really ever bind .ready on window
[02:03:38] <Xatenev> lol
[02:03:40] <Xatenev> it works with jQuery(
[02:03:42] <Xatenev> but it doesnt work with $(
[02:03:49] <Cork> so $ isn't jquery
[02:03:58] <Xatenev> why not :O
[02:04:17] <Cork> either cause you're using a different lib that takes $ beside jquery
[02:04:22] <Xatenev> ah ok
[02:04:23] <Cork> or you're using noConflict
[02:04:24] <Cork> or both
[02:04:31] <Xatenev> magento uses the prototype library
[02:04:38] <Xatenev> which uses the same selector as jquery ($)
[02:04:44] <Xatenev> thats why :]
[02:04:49] <Xatenev> crazy shit^^
[02:12:34] <Xatenev> sry, antoher question
[02:12:44] <Xatenev> how do i bind multiple functions to a click event?
[02:12:58] <Cork> Xatenev: you don't
[02:13:12] <Xatenev> Cork: ok following situation: I have an element with an ajax onclick
[02:13:18] <Cork> you either bind multiple events or you bind one function and call the different functions from that
[02:13:20] <Xatenev> now I want to go to the top of the page
[02:13:32] <Cork> Xatenev: onclick on a click event handler?
[02:13:51] <Cork> cause if you're using onclick you will have problems if you want to bind event handlers too
[02:13:59] <Xatenev> jQuery('#narrow-by-list a').click(function(){
[02:14:05] <Cork> so click handler
[02:14:08] <Xatenev> the first .click stuff is done by my framework (magento)
[02:14:16] <Cork> just add another .click handler
[02:14:24] <Cork> it won't go before the old one though
[02:14:30] <Xatenev> well if i do it like this
[02:14:31] <Xatenev> it doesnt work
[02:14:35] <Xatenev> cause it doesnt call the ajax then anymore
[02:14:41] <Xatenev> its only going ot the top of the page
[02:14:56] <DreamStiffler> hi guys
[02:15:59] <DreamStiffler> i just want to put an array into divs. I mean set of arrays. meaning for each 2 result that comes out, it will be wrapped in a div called "kumbaya".
[02:19:41] <DreamStiffler> kumbaya/join #html
[02:20:12] <Bjerre_> hello guys
[02:28:52] <alluringme> Hi I wanted to know how I could implement a page that loads a other pages(ads) for about 60 minutes and updates a variable when 60 seconds is complete. I was able to implement the timer but I do not know how I could do something like this using Jquery. I also wanted to know how safe this s/m would be if I implement this using jscript/jquery. Post 60 seconds I'll pass an update query via PHP to update a table.
[02:29:44] <alluringme> Any idead how this can be put to perspective?
[02:31:43] <alluringme> Currently I am doing this to load urls' http://pastebin.com/95mrgiQi
[02:33:29] <alluringme> Any better idea?? hanks
[02:37:18] <Xatenev> How does .animate exactly work? it seems like I can only use .animate once
[02:37:23] <Xatenev> and the 2nd time it doesnt work anymore
[02:37:47] <Xatenev> using .animate({scrollTop:0},600) to scroll to the top
[02:37:56] <Xatenev> works at the first click, doesnt work at the 2nd click anymore =|
[02:45:38] <alluringme> just put it in a loop?

[02:58:47] <Xatenev> anybody has an idea to my .animate problem? :)
[03:04:05] <zagabar> I am trying to load and initialise jQuery from normal javascript after page load like so: http://dpaste.com/3NBEQRR This does add the proper script tag but accessing the '$' object gives error of undefinedness. Do I have to initialise jQuery as well somehow?
[03:07:48] <AdamPDotty> hmm, I dont know. Is jQuery undefined, too?
[03:07:58] <AdamPDotty> (the variable)
[03:08:55] <zagabar> Yes. But I think I might know why now. I probably need to setup a callback for when it is loaded since it would take some time for the script to get downloaded
[03:09:19] <zagabar> So code that is run just after the pasted code might reach $ before jquery is loaded. That's what I suspect anyway
[03:09:36] <AdamPDotty> good idea
[03:49:57] <lilsammy> Hi all if I set a var = table $('#element').html(); can I then use $(table).outerHeight() ?

[03:53:13] <Uhkis> Bjerre_: missing #
[03:53:55] <Bjerre_> didnt help
[03:54:12] <Bjerre_> or do I need to use something liek $('#textbox2').html($this.data('text2'));
[03:54:18] <Uhkis> also, you're not doing anything there
[03:54:19] <Uhkis> yes
[03:55:04] <Bjerre_> doesnt work

[04:00:14] <DelphiWorld> hi
[04:00:31] <DelphiWorld> any desktop web browser supporting push notification?
[04:00:52] <Cork> DelphiWorld: depends
[04:00:59] <Cork> you can do push notifications with websocket
[04:01:13] <Bjerre_> Uhkis: how would you make the "text" in $('#textHolder').html($this.data('text'));  a variable? is it just var textlang = 'text'   ?
[04:01:14] <DelphiWorld> Cork: but the browser must be open, right?
[04:01:17] <Cork> the webstandard for push notifications without having the page open haven't landed yet
[04:01:20] <Cork> yes
[04:01:35] <DelphiWorld> Cork: but mobile i think is supported using chrome
[04:01:39] <hellyeah> hey there
[04:01:39] <Cork> no
[04:01:45] <hellyeah> what
[04:01:46] <DelphiWorld> thank Cork you have guided me on so many thingq
[04:01:48] <Cork> it is supported through the google account
[04:01:49] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:01:55] <Cork> it isn't related to the browser
[04:02:01] <hellyeah> how can i remove lick row from pop up box http://jsfiddle.net/a2buxomr/5/
[04:02:10] <DelphiWorld> Cork: ah, so its a google specific things, thank!
[04:02:10] <Bjerre_> Cork: yes to my question?
[04:02:20] <Uhkis> Bjerre_: just like that
[04:02:25] <Bjerre_> ok cool
[04:02:36] <Bjerre_> ty
[04:02:43] <Cork> Bjerre_: nope, i would have addressed you in that case :)
[04:03:03] <Bjerre_> ok :)
[04:03:18] <Bjerre_> Uhkis: and then when I add the var $('#textHolder').html($this.data(textlang));
[04:03:27] <Uhkis> Bjerre_: yes
[04:03:33] <Bjerre_> I'm starting to get this
[04:03:34] <Bjerre_> :)
[04:03:45] <Uhkis> Bjerre_: but unless you set that $this, it's not gonna work
[04:03:54] <Bjerre_> it's already set
[04:03:59] <Bjerre_> only the var I'm looking for
[04:06:44] <hellyeah> $(this) iget what you clicked
[04:06:47] <hellyeah> ?
[04:06:52] <DelphiWorld> Cork: last question, to do gcm notification to chrome, would i need a google api key?
[04:06:58] <hellyeah> $(this) get what you clicked
[04:07:01] <hellyeah> ?
[04:07:04] <Cork> DelphiWorld: yes
[04:07:10] <DelphiWorld> thank Cork a lot
[04:08:04] <Cork> DelphiWorld: for the record there is a new standard in the working that will when its done among a lot of other things include notification support
[04:08:10] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker_API
[04:08:25] <DelphiWorld> Cork: good
[04:08:28] <Bjerre_> textlang = 'text'; worked when using a SPA, however, var textlang = 'text'; did not work. Could you explain what is causing this? does it have to do with global variables and not?
[04:08:43] <Cork> and that one would be provider independent AND browser independent
[04:20:31] <Bjerre_> Uhkis: I added the variable to the code so I can change the variable on click, like clicking on swedish changes var textlang = 'text2'. However, it only works after you have refreshed the div, like going to a new button and back again. Is there a way of refreshing the div when changing the var?
[04:20:49] <Uhkis> Bjerre_: fiddle!
[04:21:00] <Bjerre_> ok a moment
[04:32:00] <Bjerre_> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/57/ doesn't work at all
[04:32:07] <Bjerre_> worked in my SPA though
[04:32:29] * hellyeah WRITE LESS DO MORE
[04:32:34] <Bjerre_> but only when you click on the next button. Won't refresh the one's that is active

[04:39:39] <BinaryKitten> ANJ7 - ok can you create a fiddle with teh code
[04:40:09] <ANJ7> http://paste.ubuntu.com/11798614/
[04:40:34] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: ohh, It's little tiresome.

[04:44:02] <Bjerre_> but as you can see it doesnt update in realtime
[04:44:11] <Bjerre_> you have to click on the other button to load it
[04:47:38] <BinaryKitten> got to go for meeting ANJ7

[04:49:14] <BinaryKitten> i just got the fiddle working so that i could try to understand the problem in isolation
[04:49:42] <ANJ7> I'll also others for help :)
[04:49:48] <ANJ7> ask
[04:52:45] <ANJ7> hey guys anyone will to help??
[04:54:56] <umlz> what kind of var/let/const should i use?
[04:55:04] <arthurvr> const by default, let when rebinding is needed and var for legacy code that hasn’t been updated yet.
[04:55:27] <Bjerre_> ANJ7: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/5dkwdg6v/11/
[04:55:34] <Bjerre_> jsslides is easier
[04:55:45] <umlz> thanks arthurvr
[04:56:54] <Bjerre_> does anyone know on how to update the div with the text after you click on swedish or english buttons? http://jsfiddle.net/7gyo8cg4/3/
[04:57:03] <Bjerre_> it only updates when clicking on next button
[04:57:12] <Bjerre_> I thought it was a good idea to change the variable
[04:57:20] <Bjerre_> since it will make it a lot easier in my SPA
[05:02:06] <shoky> what swedish or english buttons
[05:04:31] <Bjerre_> haha I linked wrong fiddle :)
[05:04:33] <Bjerre_> 1 sec
[05:04:42] <Bjerre_> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/58/
[05:05:00] <Bjerre_> I have a swedish and english button that changes the data-text variable
[05:05:28] <shoky> it just changes a variable in js
[05:05:30] <Bjerre_> however, the variable is changed but the update is not affecting it until you click on a new button
[05:05:47] <shoky> yes, changing a variable in js doesn't affect the DOM
[05:05:50] <Bjerre_> yea, but I need it to update the div's inner html as well as changing the variable
[05:05:59] <Bjerre_> so how can I affect the DOM?
[05:06:19] <Bjerre_> it makes it much easier for me to change use variables
[05:06:20] <shoky> how are you doing it for the other button..?
[05:06:24] <Bjerre_> since I have a lot of buttons
[05:06:52] <Bjerre_> I can't just add the text when clicking on the swedish button
[05:06:57] <Bjerre_> since there will be 20 buttons
[05:07:00] <shoky> isn't that what you want happening?
[05:07:01] <Bjerre_> that shows the text
[05:07:16] <Bjerre_> blue and orange (20 of them)
[05:07:21] <Bjerre_> lang (2 of them)
[05:07:29] <Bjerre_> one language button should replace them all
[05:07:32] <shoky> if you want text to be added when a button is clicked.. you need to add that text from that button's click handler
[05:07:36] <Bjerre_> therefor I thought it would be easier to change the var
[05:07:52] <shoky> you can change a var and then call a function that updates the DOM, if you want
[05:08:04] <Bjerre_> that sounds just like I want shoky
[05:08:05] <shoky> or, use the same click handler for all buttons
[05:08:20] <shoky> and just change the text based on which button was clicked
[05:08:23] <Bjerre_> updates the dom, any idea?
[05:08:48] <shoky> you're already updating the dom in the prev/next buttons, no?
[05:09:00] <Bjerre_> yea, but I don't want it to go to the next button
[05:09:05] <Bjerre_> when clicking on the lang
[05:09:09] <shoky> then don't put it there..?
[05:09:14] <shoky> put it where you want it to happen
[05:09:15] <Bjerre_> ok I see wait a sec
[05:10:25] <Bjerre_> no I dont get it. I understand what you mean shoky but I got a bit of help coding this by Uhkis and taplar etc
[05:10:38] <Bjerre_> so I'm not sure on how to add that code shoky
[05:10:57] <Bjerre_> "a bit", got quite much help to be honest
[05:11:53] <shoky> you just put it where you want it to happen. if you want something to happen when a button is clicked, put that something in the button's click handler
[05:11:56] <shoky> example.. http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/59/
[05:13:01] <shoky> oh just noticed  this  $this.data(textlang)
[05:13:04] <Bjerre_> shoky: that only replaces the inner html
[05:13:10] <Bjerre_> what I want is to fetch it
[05:13:12] <Bjerre_> yea
[05:14:25] <Bjerre_> and since I have so many divs in only swedish at the moment I want to change this code to work with var instead since it makes it much easier. My problem is that the var (as you said) is not changing the DOM but only the js so it won't get updated
[05:14:35] <Bjerre_> only updates after you click on a new button (orange or blue)
[05:19:21] <shoky> Bjerre_: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/60/
[05:20:31] <shoky> oh there's already a "current"
[05:20:59] <Bjerre_> that is awesome shoky thanks a lot!
[05:21:24] <Bjerre_> I think it is good that you didn't use it together with current since this code will run earlier in the SPA
[05:21:34] <Bjerre_> thanks a lot man
[05:22:08] <shoky> np
[05:59:29] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: you there?
[06:03:05] <BinaryKitten> ANJ7 yep
[06:03:25] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: I finally figured out my problem \o/
[06:03:32] <BinaryKitten> cool
[06:03:34] <BinaryKitten> what was it?
[06:03:35] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: though no one helped me :/
[06:03:52] <BinaryKitten> sorry to hear that and glad you got it sorted though
[06:04:08] <ANJ7> it was the sliding transition
[06:05:02] <ANJ7> when I press the button fastly the hide function doesn't work it goes on to next show of slide thus leading to show and not hiding.
[06:05:56] <ANJ7> what I did is, I disabled the next button until the previous slide is hidden and the next slide is showed.
[06:06:21] <ANJ7> this gave me good results :)
[06:06:34] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: btw, thanks for your support :)
[06:06:43] <BinaryKitten> ANJ7 np
[06:06:49] <ANJ7> :)
[06:06:51] <BinaryKitten> small tip, i would cache your selectors
[06:07:25] <BinaryKitten> each time you click, you're searching the dom. caching the items in a variable will improve efficiency
[06:09:36] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: what's that exactly?
[06:10:59] <BinaryKitten> ok every time you do $('selector') it goes to the DOM and looks the item up
[06:11:12] <BinaryKitten> so every time you click, it's doing that for every item.
[06:11:48] <BinaryKitten> to prevent this, you can create a variable and use that to store the result of the $('selector')
[06:12:33] <BinaryKitten> let me update the fiddle with example
[06:13:22] <ANJ7> ok
[06:14:03] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: actually I'm doing that
[06:14:34] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/7gyo8cg4/4/
[06:14:46] <BinaryKitten> have added var slides ...
[06:14:57] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: I think I was doing that.
[06:14:57] <BinaryKitten> on ine 32
[06:15:28] <ANJ7> http://paste.ubuntu.com/11799013/
[06:15:28] <BinaryKitten> updated 37, 41, 46, 52 & 79
[06:15:47] <ANJ7> var cnt
[06:15:58] <BinaryKitten> that's just a count
[06:16:03] <ANJ7> oh
[06:16:07] <BinaryKitten> it's not caching the slides themselves
[06:16:21] <ANJ7> oh, ok
[06:16:21] <BinaryKitten> slides.first().hide() etc
[06:16:34] <BinaryKitten> rather than $('.slides:first').hide();
[06:17:10] <ANJ7> can you look up from that paste because there's some change since the last paste.
[06:17:54] <ANJ7> ok, I think I'm getting it.
[06:18:12] <BinaryKitten> yeah np
[06:18:17] <BinaryKitten> just updating now with that
[06:18:21] <Superman1022> I have a few static global variables, i have a few click options which use an Ajax function and change data through parameters (so one click can have a different url than the other). What would be the best way of caching the ajax data for that one click into the global variable
[06:18:39] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: ok, thanks :)
[06:20:03] <BinaryKitten> also don't use .bind/unbind
[06:20:07] <BinaryKitten> use .on/.off
[06:20:35] <BinaryKitten> also, don't .on/.off as a click protection - use a data var
[06:20:39] <BinaryKitten> or something lol
[06:20:41] <Superman1022> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5761533739fe7aa6c78a <<js
[06:23:01] <BinaryKitten> ANJ7 - http://jsfiddle.net/7gyo8cg4/5/
[06:23:21] <BinaryKitten> have migrated slides, notify and nextArrow to cached selector vars
[06:24:12] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: ohh, that's great.
[06:24:20] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: will it fast the process?
[06:24:25] <BinaryKitten> slightly
[06:24:47] <BinaryKitten> since it doesn't need to find the items again
[06:25:41] <BinaryKitten> what i'll do is add the click guard protection for you now
[06:25:47] <BinaryKitten> rahter than the on/off
[06:25:57] <ANJ7> oh, ok :)
[06:26:32] <Superman1022> BinaryKitten, are you free to help me out with my issue?
[06:26:48] <BinaryKitten> Superman1022 sorry ontop of my work i only have 1 thread spare
[06:27:00] <BinaryKitten> Superman1022 - if i get the chance, i'll come back to help
[06:27:14] <Superman1022> awesome - thank you, appreciate it! :)
[06:34:08] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: its not working properly now D:
[06:35:57] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: I reverted it back to previous one.
[06:36:12] <BinaryKitten> ?
[06:36:17] <BinaryKitten> what was the issue
[06:36:28] <ANJ7> its not hiding properly.
[06:36:47] <ANJ7> you can look it up in the fiddle itself :/
[06:37:11] <BinaryKitten> d'oh
[06:37:27] <BinaryKitten> n over n+1 index issue
[06:37:58] <_anli> Is there an event that occurs when validation has succeeded and the form will be submitted?
[06:38:21] <_anli> .submit happened on failed validation as well
[06:38:47] <BinaryKitten> brb#
[06:38:50] <ANJ7> ok
[06:51:05] <hellyeah> i need this two jquery lib
[06:51:08] <hellyeah> <script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/jquery-latest.js"></script>  <script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/jquery.tablesorter.js"></script>
[06:51:15] <hellyeah> do you know how i can find
[07:21:11] <Pazician> Hola. How can I select only one input and not all of them? $(this), works everywhere, I want only one input to be selected.
[07:21:37] <Cork> Pazician: $(this) will target the element the event fired on
[07:21:50] <Cork> so it should be the one you're looking for
[07:22:07] <Cork> make a jsfiddle.net so we can check the code you're trying to use
[07:24:18] <Pazician> Cork: This is the code, but it seems not to be working at all on jsFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/3ksnv2u2/
[07:24:40] <Bjerre_> this is really messy and you get no html for this one so I'm sorry about that, but is it possible to make one button switch between two functions? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/84ouoqw8/
[07:24:44] <Cork> you put the code in the css section :)
[07:24:51] <Pazician> Ughh
[07:25:20] <Cork> Pazician: and you inverted how you use this
[07:25:39] <Cork> Pazician: http://jsfiddle.net/3ksnv2u2/1/
[07:26:09] <Cork> Pazician: and you can simplify it to http://jsfiddle.net/3ksnv2u2/2/
[07:28:00] <Pazician> Cork: I want like when I click then a previous element should change color, do you understand what I mean here?
[07:28:25] <Cork> not fully no
[07:28:38] <Cork> you want toe input fields to change the color of the <i> element?
[07:31:07] <Pazician> Cork: Let me explain in more details. When I click one of the input or the textarea the <i> (which is a FontAwesome icon) should change color, or just get a class or w/e. But when the action is triggered and it has a class or a css style on the input then when I click on the next input or textarea the class on the previous should get removed and applied to the new one that I clicked. Do you understand me a bit more n
[07:31:07] <Pazician> ow?
[07:31:15] <Cork> yiks
[07:31:22] <Cork> Pazician: keep down he message length please
[07:32:27] <HowardwLo> hello guys! https://dpaste.de/P4ZV on line 14, how do I capture the response? I’m trying to account for errors in form post
[07:32:35] <Pazician> Cork: So basically the 'active' class should just more to the next one
[07:32:36] <HowardwLo> if no error, it’ll be a redirect from backend
[07:32:49] <Pazician> Move, sorry
[07:32:50] <HowardwLo> please excuse dpaste, didn’t think jsfiddle was necessary in thsi case :)
[07:32:53] <Cork> Pazician: i got it, working on it :)
[07:32:55] <Cork> one min
[07:33:02] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, huge thanks man
[07:35:37] <vorscore> Bjerre_ http://jsfiddle.net/84ouoqw8/2/ As the only part that looked like it was changing was the variable assignments, you could split them into a conditional, and toggle back and forth using an additional class.  If you truly want them split into different functions, you'll want to add remove your original target class, and add a different one for a second function.
[07:36:28] <HowardwLo> can anyone assist on my form handling? :)
[07:36:47] <Bjerre_> splendid vorscore you're really awesome
[07:36:56] <Bjerre_> that worked flawless
[07:37:11] <Bjerre_> <3
[07:37:33] <Cork> Pazician: http://jsfiddle.net/3ksnv2u2/3/
[07:38:15] <Pazician> Cork: Really nice, just as I wanted man! Huge big thanks to you my man!
[07:38:20] <BinaryKitten> ANJ7 - still here ?
[07:38:27] <Cork> HowardwLo: you would have to check the api for Stripe
[07:38:47] <Cork> HowardwLo: cause it depends on what they expose
[07:38:49] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: yeap :)
[07:39:26] <BinaryKitten> ANJ7 - next iteration
[07:39:27] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/7gyo8cg4/6/
[07:39:49] <BinaryKitten> still need to handle the prevention of multiple clicks though
[07:40:06] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: oh, ok.
[07:40:20] <BinaryKitten> i've updated it to use the same code for both next and prev
[07:40:34] <BinaryKitten> and no longer needs cnt
[07:41:07] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: oh, thanks :)
[07:41:55] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: I can learn many things through it :)
[07:42:25] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: can you also add the multiple click prevention?
[07:42:25] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/7gyo8cg4/7/ = with click lock
[07:42:36] <BinaryKitten> done
[07:42:38] <BinaryKitten> :p
[07:42:40] <ANJ7> oh, thanks :)
[07:42:50] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/7gyo8cg4/9/
[07:43:35] <BinaryKitten> on the item that's clicked, we set the "disabled" data to be == true
[07:43:47] <ANJ7> ohh, ok
[07:43:48] <BinaryKitten> if it's set to true on the next click, we just skip over the code
[07:44:04] <BinaryKitten> when the slide in show animation is complete, we set the disabled to = false
[07:44:16] <BinaryKitten> it also works for previous as well
[07:44:24] <BinaryKitten> (independantly)
[07:45:50] <ANJ7> ohh , ok
[07:45:57] <Pazician> Cork: It's working almost as I want, it doesn't selects the <i> which I want to apply the class to. I tried to change the .closest() instead of "span, div" to just "i", but it didn't work out, any ideas?
[07:46:18] <Cork> Pazician: its simpler to set the class on the parent
[07:46:26] <Cork> and just let parent relation deal with it
[07:46:39] <Pazician> Cork: What you mean?
[07:46:55] <BinaryKitten> ANJ7 - if you have any questions, ask
[07:46:56] <Cork> it currently selects the wrapping span/div and sets the class there
[07:47:16] <Pazician> Cork: Exactly, how do I change so it targets the <i>?
[07:47:18] <Cork> then you can just style the .fa based on if the parent (.active > .fa) is there
[07:47:23] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: i have many :) Just wait I'm going through the code :D
[07:47:33] <BinaryKitten> :D
[07:47:39] <Cork> Pazician: you normally don't want to, cause you have to quite heavily complicate the code to do that
[07:48:28] <Pazician> Cork: I tried .active > .fa but it doesn't work either...
[07:48:30] <Cork> fields.closest('span,div') becomes fields.each(function() { fields.prevAll('i').first().... });
[07:48:54] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: http://testingss.tk/buy.php not working here D:
[07:48:55] <Cork> Pazician: if your code matches what you put in the fiddle it should work just fine
[07:49:01] <Pazician> Cork: Oh, nvm I had to do the !important
[07:49:07] <Cork> no
[07:49:14] <Cork> Pazician: you never want to use !important
[07:49:21] <Cork> make sure you set the style after the other one
[07:49:26] <Cork> (or as a more specific selector)
[07:49:36] <Pazician> Cork: Oh, yeah! Sure thing, let me try hold on
[07:50:19] <Pazician> Cork: Yep, worked out just fine! Huge thanks!
[07:53:20] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: you there?
[07:53:25] <BinaryKitten> yep
[07:53:52] <BinaryKitten> ANJ7 - did you add the "current-slide" class to the 1st item
[07:54:13] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: ooh, opps, sorry forgot
[07:54:41] <HowardwLo> Cork: line 14 form submission is actually stripe just submitting my own form to my url. they don’t have any docs on it :(
[07:54:43] <BinaryKitten> without that it can't know what the current is
[07:54:58] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: cool, its working :)
[07:55:09] <Cork> HowardwLo: as it is what submits the form you would have to dig into what it does
[07:55:24] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: just sec, there a bunch of here :D
[07:55:56] <Cork> HowardwLo: somewhere there is a xhr object, (or a jqxhr object if you're lucky) and you have to get a hold of it to be able to catch failing ajax calls
[07:56:28] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: what is $this = $(this)?
[07:56:38] <HowardwLo> Cork: i don’t think its an ajax submit, it justs a return false on a form submit, and then using .submit on the form once a token has been generated
[07:57:06] <HowardwLo> Cork: my question is regarding the final .submit() to my server. i _think_ it’s just a plain old form submit
[07:57:09] <Cork> HowardwLo: if it is a pure http post there isn't anything you can handle
[07:57:20] <Cork> cause js is unloaded as the page is posted in that case
[07:57:30] <HowardwLo> oh
[07:57:38] <HowardwLo> hmm...
[07:59:02] <Cork> (well you can handle it server side)
[07:59:25] <HowardwLo> ya i’m generating the jsonresponse server side
[07:59:29] <HowardwLo> if that’s what you mean?
[07:59:45] <HowardwLo> how do i listen for that json on the client side (is that possible? :) )
[07:59:49] <Cork> if it is json response it doesn't sound like http post
[07:59:54] <Cork> cause then you would get json in the browser
[08:00:09] <Cork> HowardwLo: unless it is through ajax, you can't
[08:00:36] <BinaryKitten> ANJ in the event, the this is the native DOM element
[08:00:37] <BinaryKitten> since we're interacting with it as jQuery, we wrap it and store it as $this
[08:00:57] <HowardwLo> Cork: oh…. damn
[08:01:30] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: PM?
[08:01:43] <BinaryKitten> sure
[08:03:09] <Bjerre_> vorscore: if I want to add and remove the class so I don't use toggle, where do I put the line removeClass...?
[08:03:31] <Bjerre_> the problem is that the change doesn't continue after a new "scene" on the SPA
[08:03:48] <Bjerre_> so you have to toggle english again
[08:16:12] <ANJ7> BinaryKitten: you there?
[08:22:55] <HowardwLo> is there a best practice / quickest way to serialize $(‘#form’) data and submit via ajax? a quick google turns up several methods.
[08:23:25] <Cork> ?api serialize
[08:23:26] <b-ot> Cork: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[08:23:58] <Cork> if you want to preprocess the data have a look at ?api serializeArray
[08:24:03] <Cork> <_<
[08:24:06] <Cork> beh..
[08:24:09] <Cork> ?api serializeArray
[08:24:09] <b-ot> Cork: .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[08:25:19] <HowardwLo> Cork: :D thanks
[08:25:24] <HowardwLo> someone said $.ajax
[08:25:33] <HowardwLo> is that not good?
[08:26:01] <robertmaxrees> HowardwLo $.ajax() is how you send it.
[08:26:19] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: o
[08:27:12] <goldfinger> wotsop
[08:27:28] <goldfinger> this site: https://www.goldrepublic.com/
[08:27:53] <goldfinger> Inflation, diversification, crisis
[08:27:59] <goldfinger> those three round images
[08:28:22] <goldfinger> they need to start scrolling as soon as the page scrolls to them
[08:28:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't see them.
[08:28:30] <robertmaxrees> oh nevermind.
[08:28:33] <robertmaxrees> scrolled down a bit.
[08:28:33] <goldfinger> robertmaxrees: ;)
[08:28:50] <goldfinger> robertmaxrees: be a pro and make my day
[08:28:55] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[08:29:09] <goldfinger> I would like them to sroll not on hover
[08:29:16] <goldfinger> but when I scroll to them on the page
[08:29:21] <goldfinger> I mean animate
[08:29:27] <goldfinger> when I scroll to them,
[08:29:31] <Bjerre_> how do I get a button to start with toggle on page load?
[08:29:43] <Bjerre_> document.ready?
[08:29:47] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre huh?
[08:29:59] <robertmaxrees> goldfinger huh?  i see animations when i scroll to them.  not sure what you mean.
[08:30:14] <Bjerre_> when I toggle on and off a button it will show text in english or swedish
[08:30:19] <Bjerre_> however, it shows nothing on page load
[08:30:26] <Bjerre_> because the button isn't active
[08:30:41] <robertmaxrees> Bjerre sounds like your page should load with a default from the server ;)
[08:31:12] <Bjerre_> it's a SPA robert and will not be used on a server
[08:31:18] <Bjerre_> will be offline
[08:31:21] <Bjerre_> or local
[08:31:31] <robertmaxrees> the page itself should have a default.
[08:31:39] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to trigger anything on pageload.
[08:31:51] <Bjerre_> so I should add text to the divs and replace it on toggle on and off?
[08:32:00] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[08:32:03] <Bjerre_> ok
[08:32:04] <Bjerre_> gotcha
[08:32:59] <Bjerre_> ye that works robertmaxrees
[08:33:10] <Bjerre_> silly me
[08:37:48] <Ice_Strike> I have a link for jquery click. It is good approach to add ID in the href?
[08:37:52] <Ice_Strike> Eg:
[08:38:04] <Ice_Strike> <li><a class="tab_session active" href="#name_$sessionId">Name</a></li>
[08:38:23] <robertmaxrees> there's no ID in there.
[08:38:24] <ceramicskulls> robert morning! is there a good jquery plugin out there that exports tables to pdf? I found one but it hasn't been kept up with and doesn't even work with jquery 2.0 > ___ >
[08:38:31] <Ice_Strike> And then $(".tab_session").click(function() { } to get the ID and pass to ajax
[08:38:35] <goldfinger> robertmaxrees: they only animate when you hover over them right?
[08:38:40] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees $sessionId = ID
[08:38:42] <Ice_Strike> php
[08:38:47] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike that would be the href.
[08:38:49] <robertmaxrees> not an id :)
[08:39:03] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike you could use that, or a data attribute.  i'd probably opt for the latter personally, but they both work.
[08:39:16] <Ice_Strike> latter ?
[08:39:17] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskulls no clue.
[08:39:24] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike using a data attribute.
[08:39:35] <goldfinger> robertmaxrees: you see that effect when you hover over them ?
[08:39:35] <Ice_Strike> I think that is better approch
[08:39:47] <robertmaxrees> goldfinger i saw an animation effect when they scrolled into view.
[08:39:58] <goldfinger> Yes, that was the fade effect
[08:40:01] <robertmaxrees> goldfinger not sure what you're asking - can you make a fiddle or bin or something?
[08:40:03] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees  data-id="1" ?
[08:40:07] <goldfinger> but there is another one when you hover over them
[08:40:09] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike that's one way, sure.
[08:40:15] <Ice_Strike> What is your way? :P
[08:40:23] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike using a data attribute usually.
[08:40:44] <Ice_Strike> I will do that, thanks for suggestion.
[08:40:51] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[08:42:00] <robertmaxrees> goldfinger i ask for an isolated case because it's hard to help you unless you can distill your question down to its basic parts, y'know?
[08:42:37] <uberjar> goldfinger: cool website.  I'm curious..  is it possible for one individual to transfer ownership of metal to another using your website ?
[08:42:48] <robertmaxrees> uberjar y'all should take that to PM :)
[08:42:52] <uberjar> ah right
[08:43:09] <Ice_Strike> I'll go with session-id = '1' AND session-section='name'
[08:43:25] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike huh?  data-session-id and data-session-section you mean?
[08:44:22] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees Yes :)
[08:44:37] <Ice_Strike> Why include "data-" ?
[08:44:44] <robertmaxrees> because it's required.
[08:44:50] <robertmaxrees> otherwise they're not valid data attributes.
[08:44:56] <Ice_Strike> Ohh ok
[08:45:03] <Ice_Strike> I didn't know :)
[08:45:04] <robertmaxrees> then you use https://api.jquery.com/data/
[08:45:11] <Ice_Strike> Oh very nice man
[08:45:18] <Ice_Strike> Sick
[08:46:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/82sLfkqn/
[08:47:42] <Ice_Strike> Thats awesome bro
[08:47:44] <Ice_Strike> Thank you.
[08:49:06] <Ice_Strike> Why does data-session-section become sessionSection name?
[08:49:11] <Ice_Strike> why not session-section
[08:52:10] <duch_kazatel> because javascript ;)
[08:52:47] <Ice_Strike> I have tested with: $(this).data('session-section');
[08:52:50] <Ice_Strike> That work too.
[09:27:55] <ANJ7> Hello anyone there?
[09:28:09] <robertmaxrees> about 733 people.
[09:28:33] <ANJ7> oh, that's good
[09:30:26] <Zeranoe> Are there any examples of a character countdown for a textarea using jquery?
[09:31:40] <Utils> Hopefully a quick one but I listen for a click event: $(document).on("click", ".somediv", ...); and I believe it propagates for it's children. When I click on a child <i> which has a background-image set but no content, it will click through it. I've tried event.stopPropagation(); but that does not work. ANy ideas?
[09:31:52] <robertmaxrees> "propagates for its children"?
[09:32:23] <robertmaxrees> Utils http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[09:32:28] <ANJ7> http://jsfiddle.net/7gyo8cg4/10/ guys when I click the back button the slide suddenly disappears
[09:33:02] <ANJ7> what can i do so that it wont disappear?
[09:33:50] <ANJ7> all the code you need is at the bottom.
[09:33:56] <ANJ7> of js
[09:34:29] <ANJ7> hmm....anyone of the 735 here?
[09:34:41] <robertmaxrees> ANJ7 your code is kind of confusing.
[09:35:30] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[09:35:34] <ANJ7> robertmaxrees: did you understand the process function?
[09:35:37] <robertmaxrees> you click back and it goes forward again?
[09:36:01] <ANJ7> robertmaxrees: nope
[09:36:07] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[09:36:12] <ANJ7> you click back, and everything disappears.
[09:36:15] <ANJ7> http://testingss.tk/buy.php
[09:36:22] <robertmaxrees> not for me.
[09:36:28] <Utils> Zeranoe: http://jsfiddle.net/r5qqh7q8/ something like this? It's not fool-proof, u can still copy and paste large amounts of text but its a start :P
[09:36:42] <ANJ7> robertmaxrees: that was my carousel
[09:37:00] <ANJ7> robertmaxrees: click back and the slide disappears.
[09:37:09] <robertmaxrees> ANJ7 2 things - 1: i wouldn't use a carousel at all if you can avoid it.  2: why not use one of the dozens of plugins available?
[09:37:47] <ANJ7> robertmaxrees: I'm learning jQuery, So I thought it would be good to build one and learn something.
[09:38:03] <robertmaxrees> ANJ7 http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[09:38:22] <tw2113> ANJ7, should have totally made your own framework instead
[09:38:55] <ANJ7> tw2113: hmm...I may do it in future
[09:39:16] <tw2113> like the carousel, the world needs another framework :P
[09:39:20] <Utils> robertmaxrees: no basically I  only have the ONE on-click event and that's for the div. but if i click the i, then it fires to click event for the div. and i dont want it to.
[09:39:23] <robertmaxrees> ANJ7 http://fixingthesejquery.com/ - this is a good resource.
[09:39:34] <robertmaxrees> Utils and the i is a child of the div?
[09:39:40] <Utils> robertmaxrees: yes
[09:39:51] <Utils> although there was more than just the first bit on events_order, my bad. :P
[09:40:00] <robertmaxrees> Utils there are few different ways to fix that.
[09:40:05] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:40:18] <Utils> i do have a span inside the div, which i dont mind being able to click either.. its just the i's that i dont want to be clicked.
[09:40:35] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:40:37] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:40:48] <monk3y> This is more Javascript than jQuery, but if I set an attribute 'data-loaded="false"', then retrieve it with .data("loaded"), would that result in JS be the string "false", or the truthy- 'false'?
[09:41:49] <robertmaxrees> monk3y that's actually more of a jquery question, and the docs will tell you :)
[09:43:06] <monk3y> Guh.  I'd searched the API's .data() page for 'false', but skimming again on your prompt; "Every attempt is made to convert the string to a JavaScript value (this includes booleans..".
[09:43:10] <monk3y> Sigh.  Thanks.
[09:43:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fcdLp3gs/ Utils
[09:44:12] <monk3y> I've just been debugging a; if ($("#blah").data("loaded") == "false") { // NOT EXECUTING! } bug for 900% more minutes than I should have.
[09:44:25] <robertmaxrees> monk3y haha that sucks.
[09:44:41] <monk3y> Yeah.  I should* have known.  * for softer values of should.
[09:44:50] <robertmaxrees> Utils the other way is to bind a separate event listener to the child tag and do an e.stopPropagation(); on it.
[09:45:05] <robertmaxrees> monk3y nah - it's kind of a weird gotcha.  i have mixed feelings about that coercion.
[09:46:25] <Utils> robertmaxrees: is e.currentTarget different to e.target ?
[09:47:09] <robertmaxrees> Utils http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fcdLp3gs/1/ :)
[09:47:42] <monk3y> robertmaxrees: yeah I only worked it out when I changed the sentinal value to "nope" :/
[09:47:45] <Utils> robertmaxrees: that clears it up good stuff :D
[09:48:35] <Utils> so e.stopPropagation is what stops the "parent" div's event firing if u click on the child? that works ok seeing as i need a separate on-click for the child anyway.
[09:48:38] <Utils> at least one of the i's :D
[09:51:07] <robertmaxrees> e.stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling.
[09:51:17] <robertmaxrees> check out the article i linked earlier - it talks about event bubbling.
[09:53:29] <monk3y> robertmaxrees: interesting; just learned that the data-* attribute changes don't update in the visible DOM (in Chrome's element-viewer, at least).  I guess that's congruent to 'loaded attributes' vs 'changed properties'.
[09:53:37] <robertmaxrees> monk3y basically.
[09:53:53] <robertmaxrees> monk3y you don't care about the element inspector :)
[09:54:02] <monk3y> I don't!?
[09:54:09] <robertmaxrees> not when you're talking about data.
[09:54:45] <monk3y> Heh yeah ok.  Not that I relied on it much before for .prop or .data, but only just noticed it doesn't update it.
[09:54:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[09:55:01] <robertmaxrees> jquery "caches" data attributes.
[09:55:11] <robertmaxrees> makes things a little (read: a lot) cleaner overall.
[09:55:12] <monk3y> There is no spoon.  s/spoon/dynamic attribute/
[09:56:23] <monk3y> Yeah sure.  In certain cases I've wanted to see the DOM reflect changes as I click/ajax comes back, etc.  But maybe I should just learn to do professional debugging, or something.
[09:56:36] <robertmaxrees> ^ that
[09:56:39] <robertmaxrees> you have a debugger.
[09:56:44] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[09:57:00] <monk3y> haha yes I've definitely been thrown that link a few times.
[09:57:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:57:08] <monk3y> Should I read it?  What does it say?  (heh)
[09:57:18] <robertmaxrees> if people keep sending it to you...
[09:57:22] <robertmaxrees> it teaches you how to debug code.
[09:57:33] <robertmaxrees> the console and the debugger.
[09:58:01] <monk3y> heheh.  Yeah I've read it, sorry, just being lightly facetious.  Just haven't needed it frequently enough, but definitely should.
[09:58:12] <robertmaxrees> hah, fair enough
[09:58:48] <monk3y> So at the moment my compromise is console.logs.  Hey; I've gone through rehab for my alert() days, so one day at a time.
[09:58:55] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[10:12:06] <Uhkis> lol monk3y
[10:12:43] <Pazician> Hola. Is there on.('focus', function()...? Doesn't seem to work when I try that...
[10:13:05] <Pazician> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aabd8b2fb254ef2c1db4
[10:13:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:13:45] <robertmaxrees> Pazician there's a .on('focus') yeah.
[10:14:08] <monk3y> Pazician: https://api.jquery.com/focus/, ".. This method is a shortcut for .on( "focus", handler ) in the first and second variations, and .trigger( "focus" ) in the third." :/
[10:14:20] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: But when I change instead of 'click' to 'focus' there's not working properly...
[10:14:21] <monk3y> Maybe it's your selector?  Or a propagation problem?
[10:14:34] <Pazician> Hmm...
[10:15:10] <monk3y> What's the type of element you're applying it to?
[10:15:26] <Pazician> monk3y: Inputs, or more like spans and a div.
[10:15:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5etnbzrd/ fwiw
[10:16:02] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Yeah, well then it's something wrong with my code, again...
[10:16:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5etnbzrd/1/
[10:16:16] <robertmaxrees> :input is your problem.  hrmmm...
[10:16:40] <monk3y> Pazician: .. spans and a div?  Yeah robertmaxrees' example of using parent/descendant selection will do it, but things other than inputs (etc) don't catch it naturally.  Set a tabindex on a span and that'll do it, apparently.
[10:16:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:17:07] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Nah, still the same. Even if I remove the :input
[10:17:25] <robertmaxrees> Pazician then you've got another problem.
[10:17:33] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically creating the form?
[10:17:41] <Pazician> monk3y: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5de1ef39b64bf4c5ffa9
[10:17:44] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Yeah
[10:17:50] <robertmaxrees> that would do it.
[10:18:11] <robertmaxrees> the form needs to exist at time of binding.
[10:18:52] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I don't get it, what do you mean?
[10:19:04] <robertmaxrees> you said you're dynamically creating the form, right?
[10:19:14] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Correct
[10:19:22] <robertmaxrees> does the form exist when you run the code that doesn't work?
[10:19:51] <Pazician> The form it self exist, like in the HTML structure, right? Or what do you mean?
[10:19:57] <robertmaxrees> the form
[10:19:58] <monk3y> Ah, dynamically, then robertmaxrees' solution will work, with a tweak; $("#parentContainerOfWhereFormIsRendered").on('focus', '.form', function(e) {..});
[10:20:00] <robertmaxrees> the <form>
[10:20:12] <robertmaxrees> monk3y he doesn't want that, either.
[10:20:23] <robertmaxrees> .on('focus', 'form input', function() {});
[10:20:24] <monk3y> Oh, d'oh, sorry.
[10:20:35] <robertmaxrees> Pazician the form element still has to exist when you run .on()
[10:20:41] <monk3y> Yeah was just about to add that ('focus', '.form :input'..)
[10:21:16] <robertmaxrees> if you're dynamically creating the form, you need to either run .on() after the form is created, or bind to a parent of the form like monk3y is suggesting.
[10:21:56] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I don't really get how do you mean with 'exist', it does exist it's all there when the document is ready
[10:22:08] <robertmaxrees> Pazician are you creating the form with javascript?
[10:22:22] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: No, just HTML, pure HTML
[10:22:27] <robertmaxrees> then it's not dynamic.
[10:23:25] <robertmaxrees> put a console.log($('.form').length); right before you try to do the binding.
[10:23:27] <robertmaxrees> what happens?
[10:23:43] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I don't even know how to do the binding
[10:23:49] <robertmaxrees> ...
[10:23:53] <robertmaxrees> you're already doing it.
[10:23:57] <robertmaxrees> $('.form').on('click', ':input', function(event) { - that's binding a listener.
[10:24:03] <Pazician> Oh...
[10:24:10] <robertmaxrees> before that line, but console.log($('.form').length);
[10:25:06] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I get '1'
[10:25:35] <robertmaxrees> okay.  change $('.form').on('click', ':input', function(event) { to just $('.form').on(focus', 'input', function(event) {
[10:25:48] <robertmaxrees> and put a console.log('foo') as the first line in there - what happens then?
[10:26:01] <robertmaxrees> err *$('.form').on('focus', 'input', function(event) {
[10:26:42] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I get just get 'foo'
[10:26:52] <robertmaxrees> okay, so the event binding functions.
[10:26:56] <robertmaxrees> the problem is the code within it.
[10:27:25] <Ice_Strike> Is it ok to use data type in <li> eg: <li data-id="1">
[10:27:34] <Ice_Strike> Or is it bad practice.
[10:27:46] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike you can use data attributes anywhere, but use them sparingly.
[10:27:57] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i have to head to a meeting.  enjoy folks.
[10:28:15] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the help and your time, have a good one
[10:28:26] <monk3y> Pazician: could you put a line somewhere to do: $fields.length ?  I want to make sure the :input pseudo-selector is grabbing the elements you think it is.
[10:29:32] <monk3y> Sorry; fields.length.  (my head's stuck in PHP atm)
[10:29:46] <Pazician> monk3y: Like console.log(...)?
[10:29:51] <monk3y> Yeah.
[10:30:11] <Pazician> monk3y: I get number 4
[10:32:27] <Pazician> monk3y: Well, now it's working but the class get removed pretty much immediately
[10:33:04] <monk3y> .. meaning when you load the page, before any clickery?  It could be because one of those fields is getting input immediately, by default, yeah?
[10:34:05] <soppman> hello
[10:34:12] <soppman> can i reset $(this) somehow?
[10:34:16] <Pazician> Nah, the thing is it's working just fine on.('click'... But when I tab, like on the keyboard it doesn't remove the class like if I click away or so...
[10:35:28] <monk3y> Pazician: I'm not clear on what you mean by 'class get[s] removed pretty much immediately' then.
[10:37:00] <Pazician> monk3y: Well, when I had on.('focus'... then it seems like the removeClass was running right away
[10:37:18] <monk3y> Right away == once the page is loaded, or right away when you tab-away?
[10:37:24] <Ice_Strike> Why $(".btnCriteriaMark").click(function(e) { } Does not work when button html are from ajax output ?
[10:37:30] <quang> dang man
[10:37:35] <quang> did jquery take over?
[10:37:36] <dimi1947> I want to get the value of an <input type="number" ...will val() do the job?
[10:37:59] <Pazician> monk3y: When I tabbed away or just clicked away, it focused for a almost a sec or not even milsec..
[10:38:22] <monk3y> soppman: resetting ($this); I don't think you can, or if you can, not sure you should. Can I ask why?
[10:39:00] <monk3y> Pazician: sorry I've gotta ask you to be more articulate; when you tab away from one input to the next, it focused on what; the old input, or the new one?
[10:40:09] <monk3y> dimi1947: yeah that should do it, if you have an id or way to specifically bind to that element.
[10:40:17] <Pazician> monk3y: When I tab or click away it focused on the new one, but is there like on.('tab' or similiar?
[10:40:54] <soppman> monk3y, im going crazy here, if you mind looking at https://braxnacke.se/ny/soppify/index.php press an artist and then a song, check js console, then press another artist and another song. you will noticed that the console.log prints twice
[10:41:26] <monk3y> Ice_Strike: if that's rendered output, and if your $(".btn..") bind-line is in the page before it's rendered, then the click handler won't find the element.  You either need to bind it after the ajax renders, or bind the handler to a static descendant of the button, that's there when the page loads, and have it look for a target selector.
[10:41:44] <monk3y> Pazician: tabbing should fire 'focus', I thought . . .
[10:42:14] <soppman> $('table').on('click', 'tr', function(event) , or if I could "clean" 'table' there somehow
[10:42:44] <Pazician> monk3y: I'm thinking something like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1314450/jquery-how-to-capture-the-tab-keypress-within-a-textbox
[10:42:55] <monk3y> soppman: heh 404'd.
[10:42:58] <Pazician> ... To combine with my current code
[10:43:14] <soppman> oh
[10:43:27] <soppman> monk3y, https://braxnacke.se/soppify/ny/index.php :)
[10:43:41] <monk3y> Pazician: can you do a console.log in your focus handler just to confirm whether or not tabbing is firing the 'focus' event?
[10:44:31] <Ice_Strike> monk3y How to bind it after the ajax renders?
[10:44:35] <Ice_Strike> using live?
[10:44:56] <monk3y> soppman: yeah it did what you said, but without seeing the JS I'm not sure what's happening.
[10:45:10] <tash> http://pastebin.com/H7yE2ueE How come my variables ( name, start_date, and end_date ) aren't working in my .get?  Feels like such a newbie question it's almost embarassing.
[10:45:21] <Ice_Strike> Or $('body').on('click', '.button', function (){ } ?
[10:45:29] <soppman> monk3y, check custom.js in the sources line 90
[10:45:41] <Pazician> monk3y: Nothing happens when I do a console.log inside the function of on()
[10:45:48] <Pazician> Through focus
[10:45:57] <tash> if I specify values in there like name: "John Doe", start_date: "whatever" ... it works. So it has got to do something with how I'm actually understanding, or lackthereof, js vars
[10:46:30] <monk3y> Ice_Strike: you bind the event to the closest static containing element (ancestor) that is there when the page loads.  Like a containing div.  And in that call you specifically tell it to 'look out for' the class of the thing you expect to fire.  So; $("#containingDIv").on('click', '.btnCriteriaMark', function(e) {..});
[10:46:52] <Ice_Strike> I understand now.
[10:46:53] <Ice_Strike> Thank you.
[10:46:58] <tash> btw, I know the stuff in my else is probably all kinds of wack, was just guessing at some stuff and hadn't tested that yet anyway
[10:47:06] <monk3y> So instead of saying "listen to this thing that doesn't exist", you tell a static parent to listen out, for the thing that will exist.
[10:47:17] <monk3y> s/,\ /\ /;
[10:47:18] <monk3y> Heh
[10:48:02] <Pazician> monk3y: Gotta go, thanks for your help!
[10:48:09] <Ice_Strike> monk3y If I don't include closest static, then it will become slow to find it?
[10:48:58] <Ice_Strike> eg: body
[10:49:42] <monk3y> Ice_Strike: ah, there's mixed analysis on that, but unless your page has thousands of elements/listeners/events, you might be ok.  You can put it on body if you want.  But, logically, just feels like better practice to only involve the closest pre-rendered ancestor.  Keeping it localised, etc.
[10:51:44] <Ice_Strike> monk3y I understand much better now, thank you :)
[10:52:14] <monk3y> Aiight peace.
[10:52:25] <Ice_Strike> So basically $('body').on('click', '.button', function (){ }  mean to "refind it" and fire it.
[10:52:27] <mdev> aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
[10:52:29] <mdev> pc
[10:52:38] <mdev> ;)
[10:52:42] <monk3y> heheh
[10:53:32] <monk3y> Ice_Strike: yeah it's just telling something higher in the tree to look out for it, if/when it's rendered.
[10:54:21] <Ice_Strike> Yep :)
[11:00:40] <Ice_Strike> Hmmm
[11:01:35] <monk3y> Ice_Strike: I dunno how you celebrate where you're from, but does 'Hmmm' = success?
[11:01:45] <Ice_Strike> It work :)
[11:01:53] <Ice_Strike> Just another question now
[11:02:03] <Ice_Strike> I have <ul data-session-criteria-id="123"> <li> <button> <button> </li> </ul
[11:02:23] <Ice_Strike> When I click on the button, how to get the id value from data-session-criteria-id
[11:02:24] <monk3y> Ah.  Always the way with code; fixed issue(n), now issue(n+1).  heh.
[11:02:30] <Ice_Strike> I have tried:
[11:02:31] <Ice_Strike> var id = $(this).closest("ul").data('session-criteria-id');
[11:02:42] <monk3y> What came back?
[11:02:59] <Ice_Strike> this in the $(".criteria-block").on("click",".btnCriteriaMark",function(e) { }
[11:03:42] <Ice_Strike> Came back with undefined
[11:07:17] <Ice_Strike> monk3y http://pastebin.com/42vm5gAP
[11:09:17] <monk3y> ooooh, heheh.  Try data("sessionCriteriaId")
[11:09:47] <Ice_Strike> ok :)
[11:10:01] <Ice_Strike> Same
[11:10:02] <monk3y> I'd seen that before but forgotten.  Not sure if they explicitly state it anywhere, but it's hidden in here: https://api.jquery.com/data/ .. search for "lastValue".
[11:10:03] <Ice_Strike> undefined
[11:10:04] <monk3y> :(
[11:11:15] <monk3y> .. *shrug*  http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-*-attributes
[11:13:15] <monk3y> Could you at least get the closest() call out of the middle and hit the element directly, just to make sure the data() call is the one breaking (and not the closest()).
[11:14:24] <soppman> if I generate a lot of '<tr data-loltrack="01> etc
[11:14:36] <soppman> can I reset or remove all those data-loltrack before next loop?
[11:18:16] <IzaacJ> hey. amking a repeatable group of items, and have successfully managed to add groups, but the remove link does nothing. code is here: http://pastebin.com/ZUBvJ6BR Any ideas?
[11:25:30] <Ice_Strike> monk3y I got it work :)
[11:25:37] <Ice_Strike> my code was correct
[11:25:55] <Ice_Strike> I put the data type in the wrong place in the html code lol
[11:26:01] <Ice_Strike> my badd.
[11:26:03] <Ice_Strike> bad
[11:28:41] <_biff> hi
[11:29:06] <_biff> how to josn encode an array to use this in js without using $.parsejquery
[11:42:17] <BillCriswell> _biff: JSON.stringify() and JSON.serialize()... I think.
[11:42:53] <BillCriswell> No its JSON.parse()
[11:43:20] <BillCriswell> JSON.stringify(someObject); and JSON.parse(someStringOfJSON);
[11:50:16] <jak2000> hi all
[12:12:42] <socialblogsite> How quick can I re-test an element’s size after applying a new class? Could the restulting change not to reflect its new dimensions due to some asynchronous process? or will the execution wait until the new properties are settled?
[12:15:14] <ceramicskulls> robertmaxrees - https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF just in case you ever need it!
[12:15:24] <ceramicskulls> It's kept up with and it's really good imo
[12:15:47] <ceramicskulls> he's not here :D
[12:22:44] <acidjazz> Hey all, I am listing data on a site that has different heights, basically like this: http://imgur.com/m2MbMyE, is there any easy way to do this? I was hoping to avoid going top-to-bottom for htis
[12:23:04] <jak2000> hi all how do it: http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/8/    in table 2 draw only countries with more of 99 ppls?
[12:23:19] <jak2000> see updated fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/9/
[12:25:38] <ceramicskulls> acidjazz: http://masonry.desandro.com/ ?
[12:26:22] <acidjazz> id rather not use JS
[12:26:53] <ceramicskulls> Then why in here?
[12:26:54] <ceramicskulls> ; l
[12:32:03] <jak2000> acidjazz any advice?
[12:32:58] <Jarwain> jak2000: i joined late, wahts your issue?
[12:33:44] <jak2000> hi all how do it: http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/9/    in table 2 draw only countries with more of 99 ppls?
[12:40:30] <Uranium|OC> $(".services-large").css("overflow");   only ever returns Hidden even though its set to visible    any ideas?
[12:40:32] <monk3y> jak2000: you'll have to select all rows; var allNumberOfPersonsCells = $("#myTable>tbody>tr>td:nth-child(4)").  Then for/next through each of them, getting their .contents(), compare it to 99, if it's larger, get the .closest("tr"), and copy that to the next table.
[12:40:55] <jak2000> ok
[12:41:10] <monk3y> That's a rough/high-level idea, but if you need anything more specific just ask.
[12:41:31] <monk3y> Can I ask what process generates the original table though?
[12:41:38] <kevireilly> Uranium|OC: any difference between overflow-x and overflow-y?
[12:41:54] <Uranium|OC> sec let me check
[12:42:30] <socialblogsite> How quick can I re-test an element’s size after applying a new class? Could the restulting change not to reflect its new dimensions due to some asynchronous process? or will the execution wait until the new properties are settled?
[12:42:54] <Jarwain> jak2000: the next best thing would be to reorganize your data into a model and populate the table with it :D (which is a much better plan if your table's data is generated from something else)
[12:43:05] <jak2000> modelate?
[12:43:11] <jak2000> explain a little more please
[12:43:45] <Uranium|OC> kevireilly: nope same result http://pastebin.com/AbR2hZ4p < simple code
[12:43:53] <kevireilly> Uranium|OC: you sure it isn't an issue like this? http://jsfiddle.net/516kao16/
[12:44:08] <monk3y> jak2000 / Jarwain: yeah that was my next set of questions.
[12:44:26] <monk3y> (how is it generated / why isn't it done on generation, rather than on the client)
[12:44:55] <Uranium|OC> kevireilly:  no inline styles its all in the css sheet if thats what you mean
[12:45:12] <kevireilly> Uranium|OC: and when you inspect the element, it shows what you expect?
[12:45:20] <kevireilly> precedence can occur in various ways
[12:45:21] <Jarwain> jak2000: You can create a model of your data in a JSON format, and use that to fill your table with data. it is easier to do operations (like filtering out populations > 99) on a model.
[12:45:37] <jak2000> ok understand
[12:45:57] <kevireilly> Uranium|OC: also note that selecting elements by class can return multiple items -- are you sure it is a single item and the one you expect?
[12:46:03] <Jarwain> jak2000: Where did you get your table data from?
[12:46:27] <monk3y> jak2000: yeah, the original HTML will render an empty table, then in JS you go through the JSON and render both the original table and the filtered table at the same time (if that's the requirement)
[12:46:41] <Uranium|OC> hmm kevireilly  ty i think i spoted the error
[12:46:45] <monk3y> s/render both/populate both/
[12:46:57] <kevireilly> Uranium|OC: no problem
[12:48:16] <jak2000> ok
[12:48:26] <jak2000> i try next code, but of course have errors:
[12:48:27] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/10/
[12:50:59] <monk3y> Woah.  setTimeout?
[12:51:35] <Uranium|OC> yay fixed kevireilly  http://pastebin.com/hMKQkc77 tyty
[12:53:10] <kevireilly> Uranium|OC: excellent! It is worth noting that you should probably cache your target element -- var servicesLarge = $('.services-large'); servicesLarge.css(...);
[12:53:27] <jak2000> monk12: http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/11/
[12:53:30] <jak2000> check please
[12:53:32] <kevireilly> Uranium|OC: also, might want to get in the habbit of using strict equality as opposed to loose equality
[12:53:33] <Uranium|OC> would speed it up =D
[12:55:14] <Uranium|OC> you mean === as an operator?
[13:09:24] <jak2000> Uranium|OC: how to loop into a html table? i dont want use jquery: var x = document.getElementById("myTable").rows[0].cells.length;
[13:11:04] <Uranium|OC> http://pastebin.com/bhhBXniP
[13:11:08] <Uranium|OC> jak2000: ^^^
[13:11:58] <jak2000> Uranium|OC thanks
[13:15:37] <Jarwain> Why don't you want to use jquery?
[13:16:36] <Uranium|OC> would be mostly the same code except $("#myTable")
[13:17:26] <jak2000> Friends: http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/14/
[13:17:40] <jak2000> not display the rows >99 persons... can you try help me?
[13:17:43] <jak2000> give me a hand
[13:18:21] <Jarwain> oh i thought he actually implemented the model xP
[13:18:33] <jak2000> Jarwain not implemented the model.
[13:18:39] <jak2000> tomorrow adapt it in amodel
[13:20:25] <Jarwain> the reason why i was asking is because if you do the model first, the technique to hide rows > 99 people is different (and arguably easier), it just takes more setup
[13:48:10] <anom> $('body').on('scroll', function(){ console.log('test'); }); why does this not trigger?
[13:50:56] <robertBusy> $(window)
[13:51:01] <robertBusy> the body doesn't scroll.
[13:52:04] <anom> Hmmph. I only want it to fire when a DIV is scrolled though.
[13:52:09] <anom> Not on the main scroll bar
[13:52:12] <anom> Is that possible?
[13:52:25] <robertBusy> "a div is scrolled" as in you have a div that is scrolling?
[13:52:32] <robertBusy> with overflow: scroll; ?
[13:52:54] <anom> Yeah
[13:53:00] <robertmaxrees> then bind to the div.
[13:53:04] <anom> http://jsbin.com/sukufuweso/edit?html,js,console,output
[13:53:05] <anom> like that
[13:53:23] <robertmaxrees> you're missing CSS to make it scrollable.
[13:54:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/tixexohoba/1/edit?html,css,console,output
[13:54:20] <anom> Ah gottcha.
[13:54:22] <anom> thanks
[13:54:47] <anom> What if the DIV is added after the dom though?
[13:54:59] <robertmaxrees> you mean added dynamically?
[13:55:03] <robertmaxrees> because it'll be added to the dom later.
[13:55:07] <anom> normally I'd do $('body').on ...
[13:55:13] <anom> yeah added dynamaically
[13:55:16] <anom> after the dom has loaded
[13:55:33] <robertmaxrees> the scroll event doesn't bubble.
[13:55:39] <robertmaxrees> so you'll have to manually bind it latter iirc.
[13:56:19] <saml> how can I remove all matching elements but one?
[13:56:30] <robertmaxrees> saml .filter().remove()
[13:56:42] <saml> $('input').remove();   I want to leave one though
[13:56:54] <robertmaxrees> which one?
[13:57:03] <saml> can be anything. but maybe input:first-child
[13:57:54] <saml> input:all-but-first-child
[13:58:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use .filter() and .remove();
[14:00:00] <saml> how can I do a filter to leave first one out?
[14:00:59] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/2259397/923919 for some options.
[14:01:26] <saml> var n = foo.length();  foo.filter(function() { n--; return n; }) ?
[14:01:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:01:46] <robertmaxrees> no need for n--
[14:01:53] <saml> oh not(:first)
[14:02:06] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/shp2p6wx/ is one example.
[14:02:11] <robertmaxrees> though your markup might change things.
[14:02:25] <arc_> wow, that's interesting
[14:03:01] <robertmaxrees> .filter() is a great little method.
[14:03:27] <blakespot> So, on this simple jsfiddle -- can anyone see why the scroll function isn't firing? I've been at this 6 hours...
[14:03:30] <blakespot> http://jsfiddle.net/blakespot/2fnhr0yv/28/
[14:03:33] <blakespot> Would appreciate anyoen having a look
[14:04:02] <lalalaaa> Hi! Why is `testThing.data('hey', 'you')` positive for both divs at http://jsfiddle.net/7weo37nu/1/ ?
[14:04:21] <blakespot> 100% height containers, overflow-y:scroll on content container, and it visibly scrolls
[14:04:57] <robertmaxrees> blakespot you're not bound to the right element.
[14:05:04] <blakespot> no?
[14:05:14] <robertmaxrees> blakespot in fact, your overflow isn't set right.
[14:05:17] <robertmaxrees> lalalaaa you're setting .data
[14:05:26] <robertmaxrees> lalalaaa that will always evaluate true.
[14:05:43] <robertmaxrees> lalalaaa - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7weo37nu/3/
[14:06:07] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: how's that?
[14:06:18] <robertmaxrees> blakespot notice how the scrollbar for the window is the one that's moving?
[14:06:24] <lalalaaa> robertmaxrees: Oh hey that's neat, thanks!
[14:07:06] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: in jsfiddle? No...
[14:07:06] <robertmaxrees> lalalaaa .data('name', 'value') - that's setting a data value.
[14:07:26] <blakespot> the Result frame has a scroll bar
[14:07:32] <robertmaxrees> blakespot http://i.imgur.com/Kw9GJ7K.png
[14:07:39] <robertmaxrees> there are two scrollbars in the result area.
[14:07:46] <robertmaxrees> the "outer" one is the one that's moving.
[14:07:52] <robertmaxrees> the "inner" one isn;t.
[14:07:58] <blakespot> ok looks a bit diff on chrome mac
[14:08:00] <blakespot> what do you suggest?
[14:08:04] <robertmaxrees> fix your CSS>
[14:08:11] <robertmaxrees> what are you actualyl trying to get this to look like?
[14:08:25] <robertmaxrees> and chrome windows has the same problem fwiw.
[14:09:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2fnhr0yv/29/
[14:10:09] <blakespot> I have a site that has the same container div structure (necessary as part of a side nav that slides in / pushes content over). So the container divs are all height:100%. #st-content is overflow-y:scroll.
[14:10:15] <blakespot> So the window is not scrolling, the divs are
[14:10:22] <blakespot> I need to know when scrolling is happening
[14:10:24] <robertmaxrees> blakespot the divs are not scrlling in that fiddle.
[14:10:26] <robertmaxrees> at all.
[14:10:38] <robertmaxrees> just setting overflow-y: scroll; does not make things scroll.
[14:10:59] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: This is the actual site I am working on: https://staging.ncta.com/platform/
[14:11:09] <blakespot> that div structure and that same scroll function is present
[14:11:12] <blakespot> but not firing
[14:11:25] <robertmaxrees> what part are you trying to scroll?
[14:12:10] <blakespot> My whole purpose here is to know when the user has scrolled any amount down the page so that I can slap a class onto the fixed-at-top header to reduce its height. period.
[14:12:35] <blakespot> With height:100% on the containers, a scroll event tied to window does not fire
[14:12:51] <blakespot> if I kill the height:100% on the containers and look for scroll on window, it fires
[14:12:56] <robertmaxrees> #st-content is what's scrolling it looks like.
[14:13:00] <blakespot> but height must be 100% on those divs because of this left nav setup
[14:13:05] <blakespot> yes
[14:13:10] <blakespot> Chrome timeline shows it
[14:13:15] <robertmaxrees> so then bind to that?
[14:13:34] <blakespot> Check this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qi9onjrekcdc4q2/scroll.png?dl=0
[14:13:36] <blakespot> look at that screenshot
[14:13:38] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:13:43] <robertmaxrees> $('#st-content').on('scroll', function() { console.log('hai');}); works
[14:13:49] <blakespot> I have bound to that
[14:13:54] <robertmaxrees> then what's the issue?
[14:13:59] <blakespot> it's not firing
[14:13:59] <robertmaxrees> that works great for me.
[14:14:06] <blakespot> fiddle or the website?
[14:14:10] <robertmaxrees> the website.
[14:14:17] <robertmaxrees> in the console.  just now.
[14:14:21] <blakespot> ...
[14:14:23] <blakespot> let me try it
[14:15:01] <blakespot> Right now, on the website, this js is running:
[14:15:03] <blakespot> $("#st-content").scroll(function() { alert("YES");
[14:15:07] <blakespot> });
[14:15:16] <blakespot> not getting alert
[14:15:24] <blakespot> about to try your console suggestion
[14:15:40] <robertmaxrees> .on('scroll' - try thgat instead.
[14:17:04] <robertmaxrees> is your code in a document ready
[14:18:05] <robertmaxrees> or after that div?
[14:18:14] <robertmaxrees> and that ID isn't duplicated right?
[14:19:11] <blakespot> ok...
[14:20:26] <blakespot> I pushed that code out to the website
[14:20:35] <blakespot> this is the js file it's loading: https://staging.ncta.com/platform/wp-content/themes/superplatform/js/superplatform.js
[14:20:43] <blakespot> https://staging.ncta.com/platform/
[14:20:51] <blakespot> I load the page -- I scroll, see nothing in console
[14:20:52] <robertmaxrees> aaand...?
[14:20:55] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:20:55] <blakespot> you see something in console?
[14:20:56] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:21:16] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:21:27] <robertmaxrees> where is that code linked?
[14:21:28] <robertmaxrees> the head?
[14:21:36] <blakespot> yes
[14:21:39] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[14:21:45] <robertmaxrees> i told you that.
[14:22:02] <blakespot> I missed that it seems
[14:22:05] <blakespot> load at end of HTML?
[14:22:50] <blakespot> i see your comment
[14:22:52] <blakespot> loading beore the div
[14:22:55] <blakespot> ok
[14:22:56] <robertmaxrees> use a document ready.
[14:22:58] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:23:42] <blakespot> god damn

[16:09:21] <django_1> its cool to ask jquery Qs here right?
[16:10:37] <robertmaxrees> of course.
[16:26:09] <Robdgreat> what an interesting question
[17:00:43] <tash> what the heck am I doing wrong? My server is returning the string OK. My condition is evaluating as true though: if ( data !== "OK" )
[17:00:58] <tash> it should be false, at least in my mind.  I've also tried != "OK"
[17:01:28] <monk3y> tash: Heh; I had an issue with returns and comparing result vs strings today, it was whacky.
[17:01:59] <tash> did you figure it out?
[17:02:06] <monk3y> You might want to check the type of 'data'.  If it's a different type, then data !== "OK".
[17:02:52] <tash> hmm, not sure how to check that. It's literally php echo'ing
[17:03:38] <monk3y> My issue might be a little different and confuse your problem.  Let's solve yours.
[17:04:11] <robertmaxrees> tash try console.log(typeof data);
[17:04:20] <tash> ok
[17:05:05] <tash> string
[17:05:11] <robertmaxrees> okay - console.log(data);
[17:06:29] <monk3y> Thanks robertmaxrees: I went afk to get snacks.  I suck at helping.
[17:06:34] <monk3y> heheh
[17:06:48] <tash> snacks are better than helping me anyway lol
[17:06:55] <tash> console.log(data) yields OK
[17:07:10] <robertmaxrees> then try console.log(data === 'OK');
[17:07:24] <robertmaxrees> of that gives you true, then share your code.
[17:07:28] <tash> k
[17:08:21] <tash> gives me false
[17:08:36] <robertmaxrees> are you sure it's not lowercase?
[17:09:31] <tash> yes
[17:09:33] <tash> positive
[17:09:55] <tash> it is logging OK to the console, and I verified my php script, which is also uppercase
[17:10:15] <robertmaxrees> then you have something else going on.
[17:10:28] <tash> I can share my code
[17:10:32] <robertmaxrees> please do.
[17:12:32] <tash> http://pastebin.com/bW5LmAXq
[17:13:20] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[17:14:17] <robertmaxrees> http://rocketb.in/paste/L6qeY6 try this.
[17:17:53] <tash> OK, string, false, foo
[17:18:39] <robertmaxrees> then it's working as expected...
[17:19:58] <arc_> what is "do you fly?" supposed to mean lol
[17:20:23] <xar> How to detect if the 'W' button is pressed? And if so, I call myFunction to run?
[17:20:53] <robertmaxrees> .on()
[17:22:26] <xar> robertmaxrees, `$('W').on(myFunction)` ?
[17:22:32] <arc_> no
[17:22:37] <robertmaxrees> .on('keydown', myFunction);
[17:22:43] <tash> robertmaxrees: if the server is returning OK, it should console.log("Farty fart fart"); right? what am I missing?
[17:22:52] <tash> data equals OK
[17:22:55] <robertmaxrees> xar need to bind a listener.
[17:23:08] <arc_> myfunction must include a statement that tests which key is being pressed
[17:23:13] <tash> the if says, if data doesn't equal OK, true ... but in this case it is false, right?
[17:23:21] <xar> robertmaxrees, any good article please?
[17:23:38] <xar> or example?
[17:23:58] <robertmaxrees> tash try 'ok', lowercase.
[17:24:15] <tash> in my conditional?
[17:24:19] <robertmaxrees> xar http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[17:24:25] <tash> i tried it earlier
[17:24:27] <robertmaxrees> tash yeah, instead of the uppercase one.
[17:24:28] <robertmaxrees> try again.
[17:24:31] <tash> k
[17:24:44] <robertmaxrees> if data === 'OK' is returning false, then you're not getting that value from the server.
[17:25:38] <tash> changed to lowercase and its still false
[17:25:51] <robertmaxrees> tash then something is fundamentally brone.
[17:25:54] <robertmaxrees> *broken
[17:25:57] <tash> well, the console.log is, but the if is true
[17:26:07] <tash> alright, back to the drawing board
[17:26:14] <robertmaxrees> no...
[17:26:23] <robertmaxrees> screenshot your console for me :)
[17:26:38] <tash> ok
[17:32:15] <tash> http://imgur.com/66gIrIa
[17:32:20] <tash> robertmaxrees
[17:32:45] <robertmaxrees> something really isn't adding up here.
[17:33:06] <robertmaxrees> oh
[17:33:07] <robertmaxrees> hah
[17:33:16] <tash> oh dear, you found something dumb huh?
[17:33:30] <robertmaxrees> there's a newline in front of "OK"
[17:33:38] <tash> oh, dear lord
[17:33:40] <tash> sec
[17:33:40] <robertmaxrees> 	window.BCOM = typeof window.BCOM === 'undefined' ? window.BCOM = {
[17:33:41] <robertmaxrees> 		'Sat': {
[17:33:41] <robertmaxrees> 			'Utils': {}
[17:33:41] <robertmaxrees> 		}
[17:33:41] <robertmaxrees> 	} : window.BCOM;
[17:33:43] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[17:33:48] <robertmaxrees> mah bad.
[17:33:58] <robertmaxrees> try doing a .trim() against data
[17:34:08] <robertmaxrees> if (data.trim() === 'OK') {}
[17:35:13] <tash> the data.trim conditional is now true
[17:35:33] <tash> just checked the php script, not seeing where it is creating a new line in front of OK
[17:36:47] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[17:36:53] <robertmaxrees> something is doing it, though.
[17:36:58] <tash> roger that
[17:37:03] <tash> thx for your help
[17:37:14] <robertmaxrees> np.
[17:50:45] <tash> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/ZpVBderA if I end up in the else of the data conditional can I somehow do the opposite of e.preventDefault and make the form do its normal actions?
[17:50:54] <robertmaxrees> invert your logic
[17:51:20] <robertmaxrees> or call submit.
[17:51:28] <robertmaxrees> though you're going to have to do some extra wiring to get that to work.
[17:52:08] <tash> k, going to have to think about this for a few
[17:52:30] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do here?
[17:53:47] <tash> i only want the actual action of the form to happen ( which is a post to some other script ) if the .get to pto_check.php returns OK.  Essentially, don't allow an insert on the db if there is already a row with the same start_date
[17:54:07] <robertmaxrees> why not do an ajax of the form's contents?
[17:54:45] <skyf> can anyone think of a reason why text() would find some text, but then doing text('woo') on the same would not replace?
[17:54:48] <skyf> http://jsbin.com/yekelobite/edit?html,js,console
[17:55:19] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:55:30] <robertmaxrees> var cachedText = $(this[y]).text(); is your first problem.
[17:55:36] <tash> robertmaxrees: hmm, idk. Not really following, sorry. I don't do this often, kinda new to me
[17:55:57] <robertmaxrees> tash you use $.ajax() to send the data, instead of doing a normal form submit.
[17:56:17] <skyf> as in that doesnt make sense on its own? or the line itself is bad
[17:56:26] <skyf> its copied out of the full function
[17:56:27] <robertmaxrees> skyf this code doesn't run.
[17:56:34] <tash> robertmaxrees: yeah I can do that....was just trying not to rewrite a ton
[17:56:34] <tash> thanks
[17:56:35] <robertmaxrees> make an isolated, functioning test case.
[17:56:41] <robertmaxrees> tash you're not rewriting anything.
[17:56:44] <robertmaxrees> you're just adding a new ajax call.
[17:58:07] <skyf> here is a full fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ejnm7o63/2/
[17:58:13] <skyf> so, stripping vowels
[17:58:16] <skyf> works fine
[17:58:17] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:58:35] <skyf> except in the case where there is raw text in an element
[17:58:39] <skyf> ie 'Hello'
[17:58:42] <skyf> in the first post
[17:58:55] <skyf> kinda weird
[17:58:59] <robertmaxrees> for(var y = 0; y < this.length; y++) { isn't what you want.
[17:59:02] <robertmaxrees> you need to use .each() there.
[17:59:05] <robertmaxrees> this.each();
[17:59:37] <vorscore> robertmaxrees: i believe tash could also just $(this).unbind() and reapply the submit that was undone.
[18:00:02] <robertmaxrees> vorscore i prefer to avoid doing event handler musical chairs like that, but sure.
[18:00:19] <robertmaxrees> you could also check for the presence of extra data in handler and then include that in a .trigger()
[18:00:48] <vorscore> yea, i'm trying to think of the issues that juggling would arise.
[18:01:15] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer leaving event bindings alone since it generally makes it easier to reason about what your code is doing.
[18:01:55] <vorscore> yea, tracing could be a pain.
[18:02:22] <robertmaxrees> that's why i leave bindings alone and just go from there.
[18:03:47] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i leave.
[18:04:12] <skyf> robertmaxrees: $.each makes no difference related to this problem
[18:38:23] <ycon_> Hi, just made my first search bar. Works perfectly in codepen, but doesn't function on my site. Any tips? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JdpdQa
[18:40:02] <Woet> ycon_: if it works perfectly in codepen and not on your site, you didn't create a proper codepen
[18:40:07] <Woet> include all relevant code.
[18:41:13] <ycon_> All I did in code pen was add the jquery Preprocessor. Hmmm ok
[19:26:56] <b1101> I have a button within a javascript switch, and jquery handles the button with a .click function. Is there any way to make the click also break out so it continues in the switch, because putting it inside the function is illegal
[19:28:27] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/8p2mu7vs/18/ i want filter rowswith only population > 99
[19:28:33] <jak2000> how to?
[20:02:24] <acidjazz> i got a simple question
[20:02:33] <acidjazz> i have a click handler on an element
[20:02:48] <acidjazz> how do i detect if ive clicked an inner element
[20:02:52] <acidjazz> i always forget
[20:51:54] <jak2000> devoldmx hi
[21:06:35] <pyface> howdy. im busy combining a whole bunch of jquery code into one file. is it at all an issue if im using a selector that doesnt exist on the current page? e.g. $('#some-button').click(function() {}); - it just wont execute right.. ?
[21:07:16] <pyface> and shouldnt give errors, since it wouldnt "trigger"
[22:03:47] <DreamStiffler> hi
[22:03:51] <DreamStiffler> anyone actually here?
[22:03:58] <DreamStiffler> i have an array of data
[22:04:19] <DreamStiffler> i need to seperate it in to groups
[22:04:33] <DreamStiffler> for each 2 arrays , it will be grouped in one div
[22:04:45] <DreamStiffler> how do dat
[23:02:46] <ANJ7> Hey guys need help.
[23:06:27] <ANJ7> look at this testingss.tk/buy.php it's carousel, when the slide is moving forward, if we click back arrow, the slide disappears
[23:06:45] <DreamStiffler> yo
[23:15:08] <lablayers> Hey everyone! I'm a little stuck on a project and I need your help
[23:15:14] <lablayers> How do I get the .text() contents of the first <p> tag in this query string (it has to be a string)?
[23:15:16] <lablayers> $("<h1>Header</h1><p>First</p><p>Second</p>");
[23:17:30] <bePolite> hmm that doesn't look like a query string lablayers
[23:17:46] <bePolite> but If that was a dom node, you could do
[23:17:51] <ANJ7> DreamStiffler: hey
[23:17:53] <bePolite> $('p:first')
[23:19:00] <DreamStiffler> ANJ7: can you help me out. Im just trying to get my array split into divs. Each 2 sets of array will go in one div. how do i do this in Jquery
[23:19:20] <lablayers> well, the string is actually a javascript variable so I can't do a dom node unless if you can select the contents of the variable
[23:19:52] <ANJ7> DreamStiffler: you can use for loop to do that.
[23:20:07] <lablayers> Code is more like this => var foo = "<h1>Header</h1><p>First</p><p>Second</p>"; $(foo).text();
[23:20:18] <bePolite> lol
[23:20:18] <ANJ7> DreamStiffler: and add html using jquery.
[23:20:20] <DreamStiffler> ANJ7: im a noob in coding. Can you guide me? I got until for each.
[23:20:27] <bePolite> lablayers: you should use reggae
[23:20:30] <bePolite> ?
[23:20:37] <bePolite> *regex
[23:21:11] <sopparus> hello, I have a prolem I cant figure out, I have js function that prints <td> loops with td-data etc, and this $('table').on('click', 'tr', function(event) {  var row = $(this);, problem is, after running the function a second thime $this will print 2 lines, and so on. so after a while it can print 20 times, can I reset/empty $('table') or something?
[23:21:21] <bePolite> lablayers: You can't do $(foo).text() on a variable
[23:21:50] <ANJ7> DreamStiffler: you said 2 sets, so use nested loops
[23:22:07] <lablayers> bePolite: regex works, but it's not exactly what i'm looking for
[23:22:26] <bePolite> sopparus: so you want that when you click nothing happens?
[23:22:34] <bePolite> You could unbind the click event on the table?
[23:22:40] <bePolite> table row sorry
[23:22:55] <bePolite> lablayers: I'm not sure I understand your question
[23:23:01] <sopparus> bePolite, I want it to print one row
[23:23:07] <ANJ7> DreamStiffler: for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){for(var j=0;j<2;j++,i++){code}}
[23:23:19] <sopparus> lke it does the first time I load the page
[23:23:41] <bePolite> sopparus: can you create a fiddle?
[23:23:44] <bePolite> ?fiddle
[23:23:53] <bePolite> !jsfiddle
[23:24:04] <sopparus> hm not sure
[23:24:07] <sopparus> ill  try
[23:24:22] <sopparus> you can check my page otherwise
[23:24:22] <bePolite> kk
[23:24:35] <bePolite> link?
[23:24:36] <lablayers> bePolite: I am using jQuery to select a javascript string variable containing elements (see code above), trying to select the first <p> tag and display the .text() contents inside the variable
[23:25:10] <lablayers> bePolite: I know that jQuery parses the string as 3 elements and I can call jquery fuctions on them
[23:25:35] <lablayers> * text contents of what's inside the first <p> tag
[23:25:44] <sopparus> bePolite, https://braxnacke.se/soppify/ny/index.php , check js console. press an artist, then song, repeat. and you will notice it prints twice
[23:25:52] <bePolite> i wonder why you're using that approach lablayers
[23:26:04] <HowardwLo> aftering using jQuery.parseJSON() on an error json, i get multiple key:values in a dict. how do i iterate through the dict without knowing the key (which input field is errored) ?
[23:26:05] <bePolite> Why don't you just use the reggex thing
[23:26:12] <bePolite> Anyway let me see what I can do
[23:26:15] <lablayers> bePolite: I'm getting content from an API
[23:26:25] <lablayers> bePolite: I'm kinda stump, but I'll try regex
[23:29:31] <jak2000> hi jquery:  http://jsfiddle.net/x1s2vxjh/3/  why not hide a div and show other?
[23:30:43] <bePolite> lablayers: $('<h1>Header</h1><p>First</p><p>Second</p>').siblings('p:first').text() works
[23:30:54] <bePolite> lablayers: http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/qrk0r43L/
[23:31:00] <lablayers> bePolite: You're the best, thank you so much! :D
[23:31:01] <bePolite> it is not optimized however
[23:31:31] <bePolite> jak2000: you're english isn't clear
[23:32:04] <jak2000> bePolite, when user select: Salida, would hide the Div: ori and show the div dest
[23:32:16] <jak2000> any advice?
[23:32:31] <bePolite> sopparus: when I repeat, nothing happens
[23:33:02] <DreamStiffler> Thanks ANJ7  ill try to work with that
[23:33:03] <sopparus> bePolite, chrome? works on all my computers
[23:33:03] <jak2000> bePolite tested my fiddle?
[23:33:12] <sopparus> choose another artist perhaps
[23:33:13] <ANJ7> DreamStiffler: :)
[23:33:30] <phiz> Lunatrius: http://flukeout.github.io/ might be helpful
[23:33:46] <phiz> it is a good refresher and kind of fun if nothing else
[23:33:59] <phiz> err lablayers * sorry
[23:34:35] <DreamStiffler> ANJ7: what do you call this ? Nested for loop? I think it is what i am looking for. let me try do thsi
[23:34:37] <bePolite> sopparus: Ahh I understand now
[23:34:58] <bePolite> If you click, It keeps printing +1 number of times
[23:35:07] <ANJ7> DreamStiffler: yea, it's a nested for loop. :)
[23:35:13] <sopparus> bePolite, exactly!
[23:35:20] <bePolite> If you click, It keeps printing +1 number of times/
[23:35:27] <sopparus> yeah
[23:35:27] <lablayers> phiz: thanks for the refresher
[23:35:38] <bePolite> sopparus: show me the code you're using to handle the logic
[23:35:58] <sopparus> bePolite, custom.js in the source line 90
[23:36:14] <sopparus> its run in a function
[23:36:42] <lablayers> phiz: + - > ~ are the selector symbols I can never seem to remember haha
[23:37:57] <bePolite> sopparus: so what action do you intend to achieve?
[23:38:09] <bePolite> when the user clicks, what should happen?
[23:38:56] <jak2000> bePolite?
[23:39:05] <bePolite> nope jak2000
[23:39:09] <bePolite> I didn't open your fiddle
[23:39:18] <bePolite> Sorry I don't have much time now
[23:39:39] <jak2000> k
[23:39:50] <sopparus> bePolite, print the tr data-loltrack onClick
[23:40:16] <sopparus> I can enable that again, I disabled it to find out why I get multible outputs
[23:41:18] <bePolite> sopparus: a fiddle would be really nice
[23:41:34] <bePolite> At least i would be able to play with that easily
[23:41:51] <sopparus> ok
[23:42:06] <sopparus> Ive never done one and im really new to this, but ill try then
[23:42:10] <sopparus> back in an hour or so :)
[23:44:00] <bePolite> jak2000: I'mm looking at your fiddle now
[23:44:21] <jak2000> ok thanks
[23:44:26] <bePolite> ok sopparus I may not be here.
[23:44:40] <sopparus> you better
[23:44:54] <bePolite> jak2000:  1) NEVER use the same ID twice on an HTML TAG
[23:45:09] <bePolite> jak2000:  id="xTipoMov" is used twice
[23:45:21] <sopparus> hehe just kidding but it probably be good to do one anyway
[23:45:30] <jak2000> ok
[23:49:50] <jak2000> bePolite done
[23:49:51] <jak2000> thanks

[23:58:47] <bePolite> Reload the page
[23:59:57] <Koopz> could use a little help here... i've got a hidden modal and want to change it's title via jquery... i'm a bit irritated since the code only works if i run it on the console...
