[02:17:56] <thinkerweb> hi, how do you read in a series of select type=checkbox name="ourList"
[02:18:11] <thinkerweb> name="ourList[]"
[02:21:17] <coldhead> $('[name="ourlist\\[\\]"]')
[02:21:48] <coldhead> or $('[name^="ourList"]')
[02:21:55] <morfin> hello
[02:23:20] <morfin> i never developed jQuery plugins before, is that correct: to store methods of plugin in object declared in closure?

[02:51:26] <thinkerweb> How do work with button in jquery ui? $("#selector").click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); isn't working
[02:58:07] <thinkerweb> ok got it, never mind, I had to chain in a button() ofcourse
[03:06:48] <thinkerweb> http://jsfiddle.net/2VgBe/ I am not getting the value for the checkbox type select inputs
[03:12:23] <Heather_> is javascript:void(0) same as using e.preventDefault() ?

[03:20:56] <pedda> i'm about to define some plugin defaults
[03:21:17] <pedda> how do i define an opts.data property where data shall get some json info ?!
[03:21:25] <pedda> what should is set it defaults to ?

[03:23:54] <thinkerweb> http://jsfiddle.net/2VgBe/7/
[03:24:07] <thinkerweb> Can read in this select type=checkbox array
[03:35:16] <codechewing> pedda: don't you just want to do data : {} ?
[03:35:36] <pedda> might be, new to jquery
[03:35:46] <pedda> this would assume data is empty ?
[03:37:06] <codechewing> yup
[03:37:35] <pedda> ah , thx :)

[03:52:25] <csehl> whats a comfortable way of preventing closures in concatenated for-loops, when using a multidimensional array of div-names that i want to apply $('#'+array[x][y][z]).on("mouseover", function() { .. }); to?
[03:55:00] <csehl> *wrong closures
[03:56:45] <codechewing> ShawnRisk: the links added to the slidedots div work for me.
[03:58:34] <codechewing> ShawnRisk1: the links added to the slidedots div work for me.
[04:58:06] <csehl> i want to encounter closure with this approach http://stackoverflow.com/questions/848088/jquery-hover-method-and-closure but im using .on("mouseover", function() .. in it to also bind functions to asynchronously loading elements, that are not there yet. is that possible? as if i would replace the examples' $('#imgSwap').attr( ... ) with $('#imgSwap').on("mouseover", function () { ... }); for elements that are not loaded yet...
[05:00:21] <csehl> i have tried the obvious, binding the functions like that with .on(), but its not working. their "mouseover" are not responding after they finally get loaded at some point
[05:29:02] <csehl> i just stumbled upon .bind, with a syntax like $('#element').bind('click',{index:i},function(e){  , how would i pass multiple datafields instead of only index:i ? .bind('click',{index0:x, index1:y, index2:z}, function(e){ ... }); ?
[05:51:33] <jamey-uk> Can anyone help me get image resizing work on this? It seems like the Blob I log out into the console should be a thumbnail but I must be doing something wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/jamey/3U8rX/2/ The bit I'm trying to replicate in the docs here: http://goo.gl/Sbp0q
[06:25:51] <tone> http://pastie.org/5123338  could someone please help me? I can't get my <SELECT>'s.change() function to work
[06:26:56] <dabear> tone: place <script>'a at the end of body, or use document ready
[06:27:19] <Cronoh> will that make any difference?
[06:27:28] <dabear> what will?
[06:27:36] <Cronoh> placing the script at bottom functionally
[06:27:46] <dabear> yup
[06:27:47] <tone> I tried with document ready and it still didn't work. Unfortunately I can't place it above or below the <body> because I want to keep all of this code within this specific view (MVC)
[06:27:47] <Cronoh> does that automatically mean the dom is available?
[06:27:57] <dabear> pretty much, yes
[06:28:01] <Cronoh> and if you place it raw on top the dom is not
[06:28:02] <Cronoh> ok
[06:28:16] <tone> IF I use with document ready, can I still place within <body>?
[06:28:17] <dabear> technically, dom ready will fire a bit later
[06:28:30] <Cronoh> yes tone yo ushould be able to
[06:28:52] <Cronoh> im most mvc template setup you should be able to add javascript or css includes from a single template that get pushed to your baase template
[06:29:20] <tone> http://api.jquery.com/change/  just curious why that would work without using documentready?
[06:29:26] <Cronoh> {% block javascript %} {{ parent() }} <script></script>{% endblock %}
[06:29:29] <tone> is there something that example is doing that i'm not?
[06:30:05] <tone> never heard template used in conjunction with mvc?
[06:30:39] <tone> and since the view is the end of the chain, i'm not sure how i could push something back up?
[06:30:42] <Cronoh> sure, well there is a template language with most frameworks (that are recent) personally im using symfny2 which comes with Twig template system
[06:31:25] <Cronoh> your Views are just raw html /php ?
[06:33:14] <tone> yes?
[06:33:22] <Cronoh> intradesting
[06:33:26] <tone> all html with <?=$vars;?>
[06:34:06] <tone> anyways, this jquery problem im having lol. i added document ready, added it to <head>
[06:34:08] <tone> still not working
[06:34:16] <tone> no errors, just not ever trigggering
[06:34:17] <tone> wtf?
[06:35:12] <Cronoh> alert('sigh'); never happens?
[06:35:30] <tone> never
[06:35:58] <tone> this is google's jquery latest
[06:36:10] <tone> should I be using .change() or .on()?
[06:36:42] <Cronoh> .change() should work
[06:38:14] <tone> n'est pas
[06:41:48] <tone> lol sigh. this is what i get for waiting until saturday morning to do this. its probably rather difficult to trigger a change event on a hidden <select>
[06:42:02] <tone> should probably bind that change listener to the other select
[06:42:06] <tone> :/
[06:42:49] <Cronoh> ho its hidden
[06:48:05] <m41is> hi, how can i create a div based by a few seconds?

[08:23:14] <FrameFever> brend_: ?
[08:24:09] <brend_> FrameFever:  append can take selectors
[08:24:24] <FrameFever> what does it return?
[08:24:40] <ajpiano> it returns the same collection that it was called on
[08:24:52] <ajpiano> FrameFever: use appendTo if you want tht new element
[08:25:04] <ajpiano> var d = $("<div>").appendTo("#bar")
[08:25:10] <brend_> right
[08:27:03] <FrameFever> ajpiano: where does I see in the jquery docu what a functions return?

[09:19:19] <Guest14189> hey guys
[09:20:00] <GeO`> I'm using ajax(), and it returns HTML code which itself contains a <script src=''...'> tag
[09:20:19] <GeO`> the thing is, jquery adds a timestamp to the script source, and I would like it cached
[09:20:41] <GeO`> but if I specify cache: false in the ajax function wouldn't it also cache the html content?
[09:27:23] <FrameFever> I want to know if it make sense that I remove invisible elements from the DOM?
[09:27:37] <FrameFever> or does the browser do this already?
[09:43:02] <soule> Hello

[09:49:53] <aqeel> hi room
[09:50:05] <ravidsrk> Hi'
[09:50:49] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/dhZHT/
[09:51:07] <aqeel> how to make green column take up available div height
[09:52:13] <aqeel> it must not cover grey line
[09:52:45] <ravidsrk> u must specify the height and width rite?
[09:53:24] <aqeel> not specific...but auto
[09:54:10] <ravidsrk> then u must add some content
[09:54:15] <aqeel> because if i give 100%, gets out of the div container and top gets is covered grey line
[09:55:37] <aqeel> the content are also something line scrollbar buttons................because i have something on top and something at bottom and nothing inbetween them
[09:56:23] <ravidsrk> ok
[09:57:22] <aqeel> the height must be of that of red div it is in
[09:58:39] <aqeel> do i need to use javascript.....if css cannot handle this
[09:59:01] <ravidsrk> no need of js, css is more than enough
[09:59:12] <aqeel> but my first priority is to do with css
[09:59:56] <aqeel> so how to make it take available height and without moving over grey line and getting out of red
[10:00:26] <ravidsrk> #toolbardetail{ overflow:auto; background-color:#CCCCCC; padding: 10px; position:absoulte;}
[10:00:27] <ravidsrk> #sidebardetail{overflow: auto; background-color: #0f0; padding: 10px;position:absoulte;top: 5px;}
[10:00:28] <ravidsrk> #containeradvance { position:relative; bottom:2px; right:2px; left:2px; top: 2px; background-color: #ff0000;padding:5px; }
[10:00:39] <aqeel> where the height and width are also unknown....meaning not specified...
[10:06:33] <aqeel> sorry to say but i am looking for height and noith width
[10:06:38] <aqeel> not*
[10:09:56] <aqeel> i mguess this cannot be done in css as the width is not specified and positioning or giving available options in height say auto or 100% are not working
[10:12:15] <aqeel> so i thing should be like this....height of green bar = height of red - height of grey using  .height().......am i right?
[10:12:39] <Sonderblade> what is the best jquery tooltip plugin?
[10:12:59] <GeO`> it's now in jquery ui
[10:13:12] <GeO`> hasn't tried yet but it looks good
[10:16:38] <Gestahlt> Hi!
[10:16:53] <Gestahlt> The Accordion of Jquery UI does something terrible with my divs
[10:17:11] <Gestahlt> it assigns them the style "display: block" and thus remove them from the text-flow
[10:20:22] <Gestahlt> any idea how to prevent it?
[10:21:26] <djsounds02> Does anybody know why my animation isnt working? http://littleideasdesign.co.uk/previous-clients/
[10:21:47] <djsounds02> no errors?
[10:24:48] <djsounds02> :(
[10:30:13] <aqeel> where is the animation suppose to be?
[10:30:35] <aqeel> site seems static
[10:30:48] <djsounds02> aqeel I've found the problem my image is missing a class
[10:31:03] <aqeel> good to hear you found out...
[10:31:12] <djsounds02> thankyou for looking anyway
[10:32:41] <aqeel> u r welcome
[10:34:12] <Gestahlt> Oh man
[10:34:15] <Gestahlt> I really need help
[10:34:27] <Gestahlt> I have a Ul / li based accordion
[10:34:37] <Gestahlt> And even if i use the li as an expandable
[10:34:42] <Gestahlt> it completly ignores the page flow
[10:35:07] <Gestahlt> if i dont pass display: inline or inline block to its style, it wont wokr
[10:35:25] <Gestahlt> and it happens with every element i use for this
[10:35:55] <djsounds02> aqeel: can see it working now
[10:36:43] <aqeel> yup
[10:36:47] <aqeel> u nailed it there....
[10:49:35] <brend_> anyone knows why im still getting nothing when i upload a file http://pastie.org/5123699
[11:01:32] <morfin> hello
[11:02:00] <morfin> so is that correct to store methods of plugin in object in closure?
[11:14:24] <aqeel> hi room
[11:14:46] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/dhZHT/1/
[11:15:00] <aqeel> why do i need to minus 1 in the jquery formula
[11:15:15] <aqeel> is it a bug or something
[11:32:21] <MistuhKurtz> So,  I need to have a slideshow that extends the full width of the browser viewport, but is at a fixed height, and I need to center the images vertically
[11:32:25] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/sb6W3/
[11:32:53] <MistuhKurtz> the first image is getting centered, but the other images are returning a height of 0 in my load() function for some reason
[11:33:24] <dns-away> http://jsfiddle.net/sb6W3/2/
[11:33:35] <draginx> Is there a way to execute a function before ajaxSuccess and see if a JSON object contains "error" and then alert that "error" (that part is easy) and then not execute the "done" function?
[11:34:27] <MistuhKurtz> use succes() instead of done() iirc
[11:35:35] <ShawnRisk> How come my code here: http://pastebin.com/f2sRt3EB isn't allowing for slidedots are not having links added to them?  This is the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/19/  Any ideas?
[11:35:44] <draginx> MistuhKurtz: i think theyre deprecating success right?
[11:35:49] <draginx> or is it the other way around?
[11:36:02] <MistuhKurtz> idk, check
[11:36:14] <draginx> just want to thank you on being so helpful :)
[11:37:55] <MistuhKurtz> haha. I don't think it's been deprecated draginx
[11:38:08] <draginx> hmm couldve sworn ive read that somewhere
[11:38:27] <draginx> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9399
[11:39:58] <ShawnRisk> Any thoughts on mine?
[11:41:48] <tone> json result from $.ajax = http://pastie.org/5124407. how would I access clients->client[0]->id->value?
[11:42:35] <draginx> replace all -> with a period :P
[11:42:47] <tone> i tried that but its not working hmm
[11:43:04] <ShawnRisk> what is giving you for both?
[11:43:23] <MistuhKurtz> no can't just use a period
[11:43:26] <MistuhKurtz> there's an array in there
[11:44:00] <MistuhKurtz> it would help if you could format it so it's a little more readable
[11:45:49] <MistuhKurtz> tone, try json_object.clients.client[0].id.value
[11:45:58] <MistuhKurtz> replace json_object with whatever var you have it saved as
[11:46:06] <tone> says client[0] is null
[11:47:56] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[11:48:38] <MistuhKurtz> your json is weird... instead of "id": { "value": val } why don't you just do "id": val ?
[11:48:50] <MistuhKurtz> run it through jsonlint to make sure it's well-formed
[11:50:47] <ShawnRisk> my question is complex, and if no one wants to work on this I can understand but I have been getting my head in a pain since.  The top left buttons are not working for me with the pastebin code but is on the jsfiddle code.
[11:51:10] <MistuhKurtz> you could also just do var data = { clients: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'joe'}, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'matt'}] } to make things simpler to work with
[11:54:41] <brend_> anybody here worked with any ajax file uploader pluggin?
[11:55:07] <ShawnRisk> MistuhKurtz: did you have a look at that?
[11:55:59] <MistuhKurtz> no I didn't
[11:56:11] <ShawnRisk> would you be able to?
[11:56:20] <MistuhKurtz> sorry mate don't have much time to look at problems that aren't very well isolated
[11:56:25] <MistuhKurtz> i'm stuck in the office on a saturday
[11:56:25] <MistuhKurtz> D:
[11:58:36] <ShawnRisk> MistuhKurtz: if I knew where the problem was I would isolate this but I don't know
[11:58:50] <ShawnRisk> thanks anyways
[11:58:54] <MistuhKurtz> I don't know -what- the problem is
[11:59:15] <ShawnRisk> MistuhKurtz: do you see the top left buttons the four small pictures?
[11:59:21] <MistuhKurtz> yeah, they work
[11:59:38] <ShawnRisk> MistuhKurtz: yes but in my pastebin code they don't for some reason
[12:00:06] <brend_> pearljam
[12:00:30] <ShawnRisk> the link comes out as <a href="#"> and I am confused on how to fix this
[12:05:06] <ShawnRisk> MistuhKurtz: any thoughts?  Sorry if I am pushing you
[12:05:31] <MistuhKurtz> sorry, i don't know
[12:06:12] <ShawnRisk> MistuhKurtz: no worries
[12:06:31] <ShawnRisk> I have to go anyways talk to everyone later
[12:07:08] <draginx> Anyone here have experience with $.ajaxTransport?

[13:07:25] <tw2113> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[13:10:01] <MistuhKurtz> heya tw2113, perhaps you can help with my predicament...
[13:10:35] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/sb6W3/ I need a photo slider that extends the full viewport width but is at a fixed height, and I need to center the image vertically

[13:44:09] <fission6> can i have a $.get block if i am going through a each loop
[13:46:17] <shifteleven> if you REALLY needed to, you could; however, that would probably create a bad user experience
[13:46:25] <shifteleven> it would lock up the browser
[13:48:07] <fission6> ok
[13:48:40] <fission6> well i am taking the results from all the requests and need to put them into a master list, will that work, or am i gonna get locking issues on the var master)list
[13:48:44] <fission6> var master_list;
[13:49:32] <danheberden> wait, why are you blocking?
[13:49:38] <shifteleven> probably now. The locking comes from where you're doing a lot of processing
[13:49:49] <shifteleven> unresponsive is probably a better word
[13:50:36] <fission6> ill post some code once i have a working prototype
[13:50:39] <fission6> for code review
[13:52:48] <fission6> i guess i asm asking how can i know when all the looping is done and print out the final state of my master var
[13:55:15] <danheberden> var done = req1.then(function(){ return req2.then( function(){ return req3; });});});
[13:55:29] <danheberden> done.then( function(){ /* ALL DONE */ });

[13:57:23] <fission6> danheberden: thats not the same as blocking?
[13:57:23] <danheberden> Cache_Money: are all these buttons in a container?
[13:57:48] <danheberden> fission6: that's not blocking, that's chained asynchronisity
[13:57:53] <Cache_Money> danheberden: right now they're just in a table, why?
[13:58:02] <fission6> ok what would i query to learn more danheberden
[13:58:28] <danheberden> ?deferreds @ fission6
[13:58:29] <bot-t> fission6, Read this for getting started with deferreds: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[13:58:39] <danheberden> ?jQuery.Deferred @ fission6
[13:58:42] <bot-t> fission6, Deferred Object - jQuery.Deferred, introduced in version 1.5, is a chainable utility object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state o... http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[13:58:45] <danheberden> there we go
[13:58:56] <fission6> will review
[13:59:17] <danheberden> Cache_Money: so, like, $('#yourTable').on('click', '.whateverClass', function(){});
[13:59:45] <Cache_Money> danheberden: sweet!  Thanks
[13:59:49] <danheberden> OR you could do $('#yourTable').on('click', 'button', function(){});
[13:59:58] <danheberden> and in the callback, test against this.className
[14:00:26] <danheberden> like if ( /myCoolClass/.test( this.classname) ) { /*mycoolclass shit*/ }
[14:08:01] <shifteleven> fission6: Another option is to pull a URL off of the list until there's nothing left on the list: http://jsfiddle.net/JxFe3/
[14:08:03] <fission6> danheberden: something like this is what i have, which i think i need help to push into a deferred approach so at the end of all the looping i have a finaly publishers_with_selected_category var
[14:08:07] <fission6> shifteleven: ^
[14:08:11] <Prost> someone please help with jquery select2 :(
[14:08:16] <Prost> i am stuck beyond help
[14:08:20] <Prost> *self-help
[14:08:26] <fission6> shifteleven: issue is that the urls are dependent on previous equests
[14:08:28] <Prost> i've tried EVERY possible thing I could
[14:08:53] <danheberden> fission6: you could merge those two ideas
[14:09:04] <danheberden> use a loop to chain requests
[14:09:22] <danheberden> but either way, you can return a new promise inside of .then
[14:10:14] <fission6> ok this all sounds good, but i have no idea what you guys mean or how to implement, need a lead ...
[14:10:30] <shifteleven> fission6: so, you get the next URL from the current request? Well, push those new URLs onto the list
[14:10:38] <shifteleven> a simple queue
[14:10:51] <gnarf> fission6: do you have an example already layed out to convert?
[14:11:24] <corytheboyd> Prost: I have never used Select2, but it looks like they have a forum: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/select2
[14:11:33] <fission6> gnarf: yes http://dpaste.org/vQtgP/
[14:11:42] <Prost> corytheboyd thanks for responding
[14:11:49] <Prost> yes i've looked at the forum plenty

[14:12:34] <fission6> shifteleven: yea its a hierachy of sorts, i get of list of publishers, which gives me a list of sites which gives me a list of links, need to go through each layer, each with an API call
[14:12:57] <grom-s> sorry
[14:17:01] <shifteleven> that's a lot of calls :/
[14:21:50] <fission6> gnarf: was that informative
[14:23:53] <gnarf> fission6: https://gist.github.com/a02555521828726519c5
[14:24:02] <gnarf> fission6: there is an example using deferreds
[14:24:34] <gnarf> i suggest you read that "bottom up"
[14:24:48] <gnarf> most well-formed javascript reads better that way
[14:25:11] <fission6> let me review thanks gnarf !
[14:25:15] <AdirA> hello guys
[14:25:43] <gnarf> fission6: the quick overview
[14:26:34] <gnarf> line 24 starts all the work in the function, makes its first request, and then will take the data it received, and "maps" the publishers into their own requests (so you now have an array of requests)
[14:27:10] <gnarf> so, line 26 says that now, we will wait for all of those requests to finish before being "done" - $.when.apply( null, arrayOfRequests )
[14:27:45] <shifteleven> good call on $.when
[14:28:08] <gnarf> the request for each publisher is on line 16, it takes its result and maps over the sites, looking for the categories - processing, and pushing to the array on line 2
[14:28:45] <fission6> gnarf: reviewing
[14:28:54] <gnarf> after ALL those requests finish, the function on line 27 executes, returning the array you populated to the console.log on line 34
[14:29:03] <gnarf> s/returning/passing
[14:29:15] <gnarf> you can imagine ".then" in 1.8 as a "pipe"
[14:29:28] <gnarf> in previous versions of jQuery - you'll need .pipe instead of then
[14:30:03] <gnarf> same function in 1.8+ but before it did something different --- Actually - i'll change the example to use .pipe instead for wider compat
[14:30:11] <AdirA> could anyone help me over here with the late binding? I can't get it to work. http://jsfiddle.net/AdirAmsalem/J3H8w/1/
[14:30:34] <gnarf> updated
[14:30:38] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/a02555521828726519c5
[14:31:44] <gnarf> fission6: does that make sense, please feel free to ask questions (also the rest of the room if interested in this one)
[14:32:03] <gnarf> danheberden: ^^^ that might be an interesting use case for your asia talk too
[14:35:41] <AdirA> can anyone help me with the late events binding? I can't get it work. http://jsfiddle.net/AdirAmsalem/J3H8w/1/
[14:37:45] <shifteleven> what's the issue? I mean, I click on things and it happens
[14:38:33] <fission6> gnarf: makes 80% sense
[14:38:37] <AdirA> shifteleven: its doesn't works for new elements (added by the form)
[14:38:38] <fission6> whats when.apply do / mean
[14:38:42] <gnarf> fission6: so
[14:38:50] <gnarf> $.when( promise, promise )
[14:38:57] <gnarf> takes both promises
[14:39:10] <AdirA> shifteleven: I can't understand it because I used the .on() function.
[14:39:12] <gnarf> and returns a promise that completes when all of them complete
[14:39:19] <fission6> ok
[14:39:22] <gnarf> without the "async" part
[14:39:23] <gnarf> imagine:
[14:39:37] <gnarf> $.when( 2, 3 ).done(function( two, three ) { });
[14:39:45] <gnarf> so
[14:40:11] <gnarf> because it takes promises as params, you need to when.apply( null, array )
[14:40:16] <gnarf> ?mdn apply
[14:40:26] <gnarf> boo bot-t
[14:40:31] <gnarf> `g mdn function.apply
[14:40:31] <b-ot> gnarf, Function.prototype.apply method - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[14:40:41] <gnarf> `unflip
[14:40:41] <b-ot> gnarf, ┬──┬ ﻿ノ( ゜-゜ノ)
[14:41:16] <gnarf> the return value of that promise is kind of ignored tho
[14:41:20] <gnarf> thats okay
[14:41:42] <gnarf> because we just want it to be "after" the process has run
[14:41:49] <shifteleven> AdirA: you're using `on', not `live'
[14:41:51] <fission6> ok you have totally lost me  i was on a role
[14:42:07] <gnarf> fission6: no return on line 20 in that example
[14:42:19] <gnarf> fission6: the promise has no "value" in the end
[14:42:24] <gnarf> there
[14:42:29] <danheberden> gnarf: aye
[14:42:29] <AdirA> shifteleven: as i know - 'live' is no longer supported. "on" replaced it.
[14:42:32] <gnarf> but the last pipe takes care of the return value
[14:42:38] <gnarf> on line 28
[14:42:43] <fission6> let me try all this out
[14:42:54] <gnarf> so its like - request | ( when all sub-requests ) | return data
[14:42:55] <shifteleven> oh, well blimey
[14:43:24] <fission6> gnarf: almost have it just a little iffy on some t hings lets see if this works
[14:43:26] <fission6> one sec
[14:43:29] <gnarf> danheberden: i never thought to .pipe( return $.when... ) :)
[14:43:37] <gnarf> danheberden: but it's damn sexy
[14:43:58] <gnarf> ?mlu
[14:43:58] <b-ot> gnarf, much like urself
[14:44:12] <danheberden> aye, that's part of what prompted my task based dfd lbi
[14:44:13] <danheberden> *lib
[14:44:19] <danheberden> because nesting that shit gets uggggly
[14:45:06] <AdirA> shifteleven: right now I only talking about the status change function which attached to the ".status_value"->click event.
[14:47:06] <fission6> gnarf: where cna i read up more on all this deffered stuff,i think i almost have it but need some more help around pipe and apply
[14:49:42] <gnarf> ?deferred.pipe
[14:49:47] <gnarf> `deferred.pipe
[14:49:56] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe
[14:50:09] <gnarf> fission6: https://gist.github.com/a02555521828726519c5 --- i added a quick example of "caching" too
[14:50:11] <fission6> ok
[14:50:25] <gnarf> fission6: just to show why using promises for async = the awesome
[14:51:15] <fission6> so wait, how does this cache component work
[14:51:17] <gnarf> fission6: the "apply" thing is just using a core JavaScript method to make http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when take an array of promises
[14:51:31] <shifteleven> AdirA: so, if you want to use on, use: $('#container').on('click', '.status_value', fn)
[14:51:49] <shifteleven> however, I do that, I see your extensions to Object interfering and causing a jQuery error
[14:51:53] <shifteleven> this one: Object.prototype.addZero
[14:52:11] <gnarf> fission6: the promise itself retains is resolution - you can add more callbacks to it whenever you want, and if the data already exists, they are resolved immediately
[14:52:41] <gnarf> so by storing the promise that $.get returns, and returning the same request, you effectively cache it
[14:53:03] <shifteleven> gnarf: or let the browser cache it :)
[14:53:26] <gnarf> shifteleven: yeah, but then you are still making a request - this way you are just storing the result of the last request
[14:53:38] <gnarf> shifteleven: plus - most API's don't cache
[14:53:42] <gnarf> for sane reasons
[14:54:13] <fission6> gnarf: getting lots of Cannot read property 'length' of null on line 7 https://gist.github.com/a02555521828726519c5
[14:54:26] <shifteleven> and if the API doesn't want you to cache it, you probably shouldn't :)
[14:54:34] <shifteleven> but yes...proceed
[14:54:46] <gnarf> fission6: console.log( site ) -- without the exact data in front of me its hard to know what was happening there
[14:55:06] <gnarf> see if site.content_categories has the right data
[14:55:25] <fission6> yep just did
[14:55:32] <fission6> site.content_Categories can be null
[14:55:39] <fission6> if its empty (obviously)
[14:55:57] <gnarf> if (site.content_categories) {} around the each then?
[14:56:08] <fission6> should i wrap it in a if or do someting like $.each( site.content_categories || []
[14:56:15] <gnarf> the || [] makes sense too
[14:56:20] <gnarf> less code
[14:56:21] <gnarf> :)
[14:56:22] <gnarf> +1
[14:56:33] <AdirA> shifteleven: when I do what you said I get: "Error: TypeError: matchExpr[type].exec is not a function
[14:56:33] <AdirA> Source file: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.js
[14:56:33] <AdirA> Line: 4717"
[14:57:03] <shifteleven> yeah, I think this is caused by Object.prototype.addZero
[14:57:23] <gnarf> jQuery doesn't support any extensions on Object.prototype
[14:57:29] <shifteleven> all the Object.prototype stuff
[14:57:44] <gnarf> http://erik.eae.net/archives/2005/06/06/22.13.54/
[14:57:49] <gnarf> 2005
[14:59:05] <shifteleven> is jQuery looking for a patch to place if (obj.hasOwnPrototype(xx)) into all those if statements to get around that?
[14:59:11] <gnarf> hell no shifteleven
[14:59:20] <gnarf> :)
[14:59:25] <AdirA> shifteleven, gnarf: thanks its worked for the status_value event.
[14:59:26] <shifteleven> lol. fair enough
[14:59:36] <gnarf> its pretty much the one "rule" we have about the environment
[14:59:46] <gnarf> you can't mess with Object.prototype, nor should you be
[15:00:05] <AdirA> but why its worked ok so far?
[15:00:05] <shifteleven> very reasonable
[15:00:31] <shifteleven> AdirA: you ended up executing a code paths where it wasn't an issue
[15:00:34] <shifteleven> until now
[15:02:25] <AdirA> shifteleven: ok, just to make sure -  $('#container').on('click', '.status_value', function(){}), the '#container' must be an element which exist from the begining right?
[15:03:28] <fission6> gnarf: this is working nicellly
[15:03:30] <fission6> thank you so much
[15:03:34] <fission6> do you have a gittip
[15:04:20] <gnarf> fission6: no problem - @gnarf37
[15:05:34] <fission6> cool hopefully i can wrap this up a bit more - and throw you a tip for you excellent help
[15:05:50] <gnarf> fission6: all said and done, if you can wrap your mind around promises, you'll make your own life easier :)
[15:05:57] <fission6> what was the resources you sais i should review to better understand deferreds and making logic like ajax calls chained
[15:06:10] <fission6> so promises are used for chaining async things
[15:06:16] <fission6> in short laymen terms
[15:08:10] <gnarf> fission6: yes
[15:08:23] <gnarf> fission6: its an abstraction layer for dealing with async data
[15:08:41] <gnarf> leading to a common interface you can count on... .done().fail().pipe().etc...
[15:08:42] <fission6> ok, ill review
[15:08:52] <fission6> so whats up with pipe and .then
[15:09:08] <gnarf> fission6: .then used to be an alias for .then( done, fail )
[15:09:11] <gnarf> basically
[15:09:13] <gnarf> but now
[15:09:14] <gnarf> its pipe
[15:09:25] <gnarf> because there is another spec of Promises out there
[15:09:33] <gnarf> and we are aiming for better compatibility with them
[15:09:35] <fission6> jesus ok
[15:09:35] <gnarf> so
[15:09:45] <gnarf> .then is their main "entry point"
[15:09:55] <fission6> ill have to review all this
[15:10:04] <fission6> im on the python server side
[15:10:18] <gnarf> ?deferreds
[15:10:19] <bot-t> Read this for getting started with deferreds: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[15:10:24] <cjorg_000> how do I use the isOpen() with the UI Dialog?
[15:11:26] <cjorg_000> do I use $(this).isOpen() == true, OR do I use $(this).dialog().isOpen() == true?
[15:11:38] <gnarf> fission6: also, there was a decent deferred talk in SF too, are you a watch a conf talk learner, or a read a blog post learner?
[15:11:41] <fission6> so one last thing with the code, https://gist.github.com/a02555521828726519c5, now that this is working, there is a little more logic i need to add - if the 'if' statement fails in line 10, i need an else {} block which goes one level deeper and calls a service for http://sand.api.whatever.com/links, i assume i just next the same logic for this as i did for Publisher->Site Site->Link
[15:13:06] <gnarf> fission6: yeah, you'd want to make processSite return a promise, then switch the pipe on line 20 to return a when of the array of promises you return
[15:14:05] <fission6> gnarf: hmm ok
[15:14:23] <fission6> i need to make a processLink
[15:14:30] <gnarf> also, if you call when with "real values" like `true`, when converts them to a the promise that is "resolved immediately"
[15:15:12] <gnarf> so you can just "return true" instead of a request from the $.map
[15:15:13] <fission6> hmm not sure what that means in terms of my code, again, learning
[15:15:49] <gnarf> in the case were you don't need to request, you can just return whatever that isn't a promise, and since you are passing it through $.when() it will act like an immediately resolved promise anyway
[15:18:08] <fission6> hmm not sure what that means, damn , let me try to add some code for a review
[15:18:17] <gnarf> fission6: http://vimeo.com/22687950 - http://www.confreaks.com/videos/993-jqcon2012-i-promise-to-show-you-when-to-use-deferreds
[15:18:21] <fission6> to go to Publisher->Site->Link if the if statementis broke
[15:18:33] <fission6> will watch shortly
[15:18:51] <gnarf> also, danheberden is sexy :)
[15:21:03] <fission6> gnarf: should i have function processLink inside the else {}
[15:21:51] <gnarf> fission6: so, I usually put functions at the top of the scope they are declared in
[15:22:02] <gnarf> because thats what the JS interpreter does anyway
[15:22:09] <gnarf> function statements are "hoisted"
[15:22:22] <fission6> ok i think i just did that
[15:22:25] <fission6> one sec
[15:22:57] <gnarf> also, I generally put a function in the outer most scope it could be in... I.E. if processLink doesn't need access to "site" from processSite, don't define it inside of processSite
[15:23:25] <gnarf> i left processSite inside of processPublisher because it ends up pushing "publisher"
[15:23:37] <gnarf> so it needed that scoped variable
[15:26:29] <fission6> gnarf: yea i believe they all need scope to one another since they is a higheiertical thing, almost have sample code one sec
[15:28:03] <CodesStuff> gnarf: Wanna be a guinea pig?
[15:28:23] <CodesStuff> (assuming you've got Instagram, that is)
[15:29:01] <gnarf> whats instagram?
[15:29:04] <gnarf> :)
[15:30:08] <danheberden> why would i want to be in a stag or a ram?
[15:30:10] <CodesStuff> lol
[15:30:12] <CodesStuff> DISREGARD
[15:36:41] <fission6> gnarf: almost have it working, it doesn't seem to loop throug properly all the sites that don't meet the if conditition and fall into the else block http://dpaste.org/7Sg8O/
[15:38:08] <gnarf> fission6: i think the else is badly placed
[15:38:17] <gnarf> fission6: really, what you want is if it matched nothing in the each right?
[15:38:40] <fission6> right
[15:39:00] <fission6> basically if it did not match on the site level, i need to take the site and query for its placements through the api
[15:39:10] <fission6> and go through those to see if any of those items match the category_id
[15:39:15] <fission6> so itsl ike one more level deep
[15:40:54] <gnarf> fission6: https://gist.github.com/d7e7ae00c2873adaa63c
[15:41:15] <gnarf> fission6: so if "foundCategory" gets set to true, no other request is made
[15:42:01] <gnarf> fission6: also, just edited line 39 to return the when
[15:42:05] <fission6> ah so that "works" but the logic from the business side is off
[15:42:36] <gnarf> fission6: so that it actually waits for all those responses before resolving
[15:42:47] <fission6> all sites that do not match the category_id need to call processPlacement
[15:43:16] <gnarf> fission6: that should do that
[15:43:19] <fission6> ohi see
[15:43:22] <fission6> ok
[15:43:24] <fission6> very good let me review
[15:43:51] <fission6> how come i dont need something like line 49 in line 39
[15:43:55] <fission6> the when.apply
[15:44:07] <gnarf> i did that
[15:44:16] <gnarf> return $.when.apply( null, $.map( data.response.sites, processSite ) );
[15:44:27] <gnarf> that was the edit after the first paste - refresh :)
[15:44:59] <gnarf> oops
[15:45:05] <gnarf> nah
[15:45:06] <gnarf> its okay
[15:45:16] <gnarf> did you mean on line 30?
[15:45:38] <fission6> yep!
[15:45:54] <gnarf> so, you would need that, if processSite created more async logic
[15:45:56] <gnarf> but its a sync call
[15:46:14] <gnarf> it wouldn't hurt to add it - but it doesn't require it
[15:46:26] <gnarf> s/processSite/processPlacement/
[15:46:55] <fission6> ok
[15:46:58] <fission6> hmmmm very cool
[15:47:06] <fission6> how long have you been programming with js gnarf
[15:47:23] <gnarf> fission6: on and off since '95 or so
[15:50:09] <fission6> damn
[15:50:21] <fission6> is it your current technology you dev most with
[15:50:54] <gnarf> yeah
[15:51:14] <gnarf> I'm a recovering PHP user too
[15:51:35] <fission6> word
[15:51:40] <fission6> very cool
[15:51:42] <gnarf> although - I wish I had more time to actually write stuff with JS - anymore I end up spending a lot of time with the jQuery sysadmin stuff
[15:52:57] <fission6> what do you mean? are you the sysadmun for jquery.com
[15:55:01] <zsoc> ugh can i escape a -? i tried \- and \\- the context is : ll('#field option[value='AE-A']).remove();
[15:57:36] <Gestahlt> Do you guys have some hints on nested accordions?
[15:57:43] <Gestahlt> Im using rails
[15:57:51] <Gestahlt> I just need a pointer
[15:58:07] <Gestahlt> right now i try to call the accordion over again
[15:58:12] <Gestahlt> but that ends up badly
[15:58:14] <Gestahlt> very
[15:59:06] <zsoc> ahhh double quotes aight
[15:59:25] <fission6> gnarf: gonna take a break but i think i have the prototype working thank you so much
[15:59:38] <fission6> i am going to review the videos and reousrces to understand promises too - i .... promise
[16:09:53] <gnarf> fission6: yeah, I'm the Infrastructure team lead, also on Core & UI
[16:11:29] <fission6> for jquery.com you're saying
[16:16:36] <gnarf> fission6: and the rest of the sites yea
[16:20:26] <chare> jquery-ui can be obtained in components, is there a way to get jquery in components too?
[16:21:17] <holodoc> You can use sizzle which is its selector component :)
[16:21:30] <gnarf> chare: you can build it yourself from source
[16:21:36] <gnarf> chare: but we don't have a download link
[16:21:44] <gnarf> chare: or builder
[16:22:00] <gnarf> but you can do things like build without effects or ajax or whatev
[16:22:21] <gnarf> its still under development to split things out like that
[16:23:02] <chare> so you guys acknowledge that jquery is bloated
[16:23:15] <razzi> lol
[16:23:34] <gnarf> ?
[16:23:38] <razzi> because it takes 5 microseconds more to load?
[16:24:33] <gnarf> chare: its pretty much as lean as we can keep it and still support everything - 32k min/gz is a tiny library compared to any image you load
[16:25:20] <razzi> every single day I am thankful for the existence of jQuery.
[16:25:52] <gnarf> chare: we acknowledge that there are use cases where people only need selectors/css for instance
[16:26:05] <holodoc> But this optional feature download option is in development?
[16:26:22] <gnarf> holodoc: not active, we are supporting the custom builds tho
[16:26:22] <chare> gnarf you gonna get the custom dl option out by the end of the year?
[16:26:35] <gnarf> chare: doubtful, perhaps in the 1.9/2.0 release
[16:26:42] <gnarf> but even then, its not a very high priority
[16:26:46] <chare> what exactly are you guys working on
[16:26:48] <gnarf> you don't really save much by not including these things
[16:27:01] <chare> you're assuming that everyone has 10000mbs broadband
[16:27:26] <gnarf> no, i assume most people load this shit over GPRS
[16:27:35] <gnarf> and i optimize things for byte size, etc
[16:28:09] <chare> so wouldn't cutting up things like jquery-ui allows optimize byte size?
[16:28:22] <gnarf> chare: UI is already in components
[16:28:30] <gnarf> chare: we don't expect people to include the whole suite
[16:28:35] <chare> BUT jquery itself isn't
[16:29:01] <gnarf> chare: it is in code, but "jQuery core" is a defined set of APIs that include AJAX, CSS, Selectors, Animation, and Events
[16:29:51] <chare> so why hasn't there been separating out the selector stuff
[16:29:56] <gnarf> we have all those things, and releasing versions without those things could break in ways that are hard for plugin authors - like if someone had jQuery without animation, and trys to include a plugin that uses .fadeToggle
[16:30:06] <gnarf> chare: selectors is already "Sizzle"
[16:30:10] <gnarf> can be used on it's own
[16:30:27] <holodoc> sizzle is great
[16:30:28] <gnarf> http://sizzlejs.com/
[16:30:44] <holodoc> Less that 5KB if I remember when min+gz
[16:31:38] <holodoc> People can easily build their own libraries on it since it gives the most important functionality of a DOM manipulation library - selectors.
[16:31:38] <chare> wtf why is that a separate project
[16:32:19] <holodoc> Its part of jQuery history :)
[16:32:49] <chare> suppose I want sizzlejs and jquery.ui.draggable and jquery.ui.droppable
[16:32:52] <chare> is that possible
[16:32:59] <gnarf> chare: ui requires core
[16:33:03] <chare> NO
[16:33:07] <chare> omg no
[16:33:31] <chare> gnarf you gonna fix that dependency problem?
[16:33:33] <lapak10> can we use jQuery ui calender without core?
[16:33:40] <gnarf> draggable/droppable rely specifically on events from core
[16:33:56] <gnarf> chare: thats not a dependency problem, its a dependency
[16:33:57] <chare> gnarf you need to fix this lack of encapsulation
[16:34:14] <gnarf> chare: how about you do it?
[16:34:17] <tw2113> gnarf, fix shit
[16:34:25] <tw2113> :P
[16:34:30] <tw2113> jk
[16:34:48] <lapak10> anyone please help
[16:34:50] <lapak10> ??
[16:34:58] <gnarf> well, events and selectors - probably a little of CSS as well
[16:35:06] <gnarf> (re drag/dropable from UI )
[16:35:18] <holodoc> ganrf: Are you part of the jQuery team? You sound like you are.
[16:35:24] <tw2113> lapak10, "ui requires core"
[16:35:26] <gnarf> holodoc: yes
[16:35:34] <tw2113> from gnarf 1 minute before you asked that
[16:35:35] <holodoc> Good to know. Thanks.
[16:35:46] <tw2113> unless you came in after he said that, i don't see join/part messages
[16:35:53] <lapak10> tw2113 thanks!!
[16:36:23] <chare> god jquery is so damn bloated
[16:37:23] <lapak10> setting appropriate headers in the PHP file to application/x-json .....makes its available over cross domain?
[16:37:32] <lapak10> its that true?
[16:37:36] <gnarf> chare: then don't use it
[16:37:40] <tw2113> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src
[16:37:41] <gnarf> chare: or help fix it
[16:37:47] <gnarf> chare: don't complain idly
[16:37:56] <tw2113> even mentions sizzle at that url
[16:38:00] <lapak10> or the only way to get cross domain JSON is via JSONP??
[16:38:36] <gnarf> lapak10: yes - that and CORS which is a pain
[16:39:01] <chare> i'm going to fork jquery and kill the jquery project
[16:39:03] <isner_> should is necessary to change all the php script you have made for ajax upload pluggins?
[16:39:43] <tw2113> so?you're going to add to the pool of DOM manipulation libraries chare ?
[16:41:27] <chare> tw2113 just fix jquery bloat for me
[16:42:01] <tw2113> ah, your own modified version for personal use
[16:43:02] <chare> you guys notice that google loads really fast, mm i wonder if thats because they don't use bloated jquery
[16:43:50] <gnarf> chare: i wish i knew what you've spend years of your life dedicated to improving so I could show up in it's support channel and start throwing hate speech at it
[16:44:53] <tw2113> chare, i just did a diff check on http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.min.js and http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js
[16:44:58] <tw2113> came up with the same results
[16:45:18] <tw2113> "The two files are identical"
[16:45:18] <vladikoff> tw2113, wat
[16:45:38] <tw2113> http://diffchecker.com
[16:45:48] <tw2113> copy/paste both into that, and hit "find difference"
[16:45:52] <vladikoff> tw2113, calm down, this is what the person meant in the first place
[16:45:56] <gnarf> tw2113: google doesn't actually load it to be fair, it just hosts it for the world :)
[16:46:10] <tw2113> just sayin
[16:46:16] <tw2113> i've got nothing better to do for the moment
[16:48:09] <lapak10> cdnjs.com are good to use too
[16:52:43] <isner_> damn im strugglin with ajax uploading
[16:53:25] <draginx> Anyone here played with $.ajaxTransport?
[16:56:22] <lapak10> no !dea :D
[16:57:14] <gnarf> ?ask @draginx
[16:57:14] <bot-t> draginx, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:58:00] <draginx> https://gist.github.com/077161a935573aad71ca
[16:58:09] <draginx> For some reason, tje json doesn't get passed on
[16:58:26] <draginx> and no AJAX request is made
[16:59:29] <gnarf> draginx: have you looked at jaubourg's ajaxhooks for any examples of transports?
[16:59:41] <draginx> No, I'm not even sure who haubourg is
[17:00:06] <draginx> oh this is awesome thanks
[17:00:14] <gnarf> draginx: https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[17:00:33] <gnarf> draginx: jaubourg = the author of jQuery 1.5 ajax rewrite
[17:00:39] <draginx> ah
[17:00:43] <gnarf> also, he compiles useful hooks/addins
[17:01:10] <gnarf> draginx: take a look at like https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/laxjson.js
[17:01:29] <draginx> thats prefilter
[17:01:31] <draginx> *not* want I want
[17:01:32] <gnarf> you might not have to transport it tho
[17:01:45] <draginx> I need something that gets called *after* the request, but before done()
[17:02:52] <gnarf> draginx: yeah, xdr prolly a better example of the right way to hook in
[17:02:57] <draginx> thanks :)
[17:03:06] <gnarf> even https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/css.js
[17:03:11] <gnarf> that adds a "css" transport
[17:03:53] <gnarf> p.s. - I wouldn't suggest overriding the default "json" transport, specify your own transport/option/type instead
[17:04:25] <draginx> Why?
[17:04:32] <draginx> this is a closed website so not available ot the public
[17:04:47] <draginx> It's better to just overwrite then to edit 50 files :)
[17:05:21] <gnarf> draginx: if the "json" transport starts doing weird things you won't be able to repro them unless you also copy the transport, which might not be something the debugging party is aware of at the time
[17:06:01] <draginx> but ifim overwriting the transport
[17:06:06] <draginx> any bugs created by the team wont affect me
[17:06:23] <gnarf> draginx: i mean, do what you must, but you might just confuse yourself or a co-worker later down the line :)
[17:06:33] <draginx> ah I see what u mean by debugger party now :D
[17:07:06] <gnarf> draginx: even if you write a prefilter to change json -> myjson
[17:07:29] <gnarf> at least then the options object will show that its transport was "myjson" ya know?
[17:07:42] <draginx> what good will that do? O_o if the person sets global: false as an option in the AJAX obj then it wont execute 'myjson' ?
[17:07:49] <draginx> ah i see
[17:08:01] <draginx> so I wont need to edit all 50 files still interesting
[17:08:23] <gnarf> best of both
[17:08:53] <gnarf> still a little "automatic" but leaves clues to find itself later :)
[17:10:18] <lapak10> is there any plugin for ajax file uploader with progress bar??
[17:12:01] <gnarf> lapak10: I've had luck integrating plupload
[17:12:03] <draginx> lapak10: blueimp's jquery plugin
[17:12:57] <draginx> https://gist.github.com/0c83370dfa1c049b05e6 any idea why none of my console.logs(0s are deubugging?
[17:13:33] <gnarf> draginx: set the transport in your prefilter ?
[17:13:48] <draginx> but the prefilter.. is *before* the request right?
[17:13:51] <draginx> if I'm not mistaken?
[17:14:15] <gnarf> its "type"
[17:14:18] <gnarf> so
[17:14:33] <gnarf> if you call a "myjson" transport, it only gets called when the dataType: "myjson"
[17:14:44] <draginx> oh thats what i was trying to avoid! lol
[17:14:49] <draginx> i just want json :)
[17:14:52] <gnarf> you can set that in the pre-filter
[17:14:53] <draginx> so I dont need to edit 50+ files u know?
[17:15:03] <draginx> thats what i tried doing O_o in my gist..
[17:15:07] <gnarf> if ( options.dataType === "json" ) { options.dataType = "myjson"; }
[17:15:09] <draginx>  options.converters["json"] = myjson;
[17:15:15] <draginx> oh
[17:15:19] <gnarf> also
[17:15:21] <gnarf> you can prolly use
[17:15:31] <gnarf> options.converters.myjson = myjson;
[17:15:41] <gnarf> because you are changing the datatype
[17:15:44] <gnarf> to "myjson"
[17:16:20] <draginx> yeah still doesnt execute the console.logs
[17:16:21] <gnarf> also, you could prolly just options.converters.myjson = $.parseJSON :)
[17:16:58] <gnarf> draginx: drop a breakpoint/console.log in the transport function, make sure it's being called?
[17:17:19] <draginx> yeah thats what ive been trying to do :/
[17:17:26] <gnarf> you are like inside the send
[17:17:33] <gnarf> outside that?
[17:17:49] <gnarf> like - like 17 on the gist?
[17:18:11] <gnarf> you have the s.crossDomain and s.async copy/pasta'ed or do you really want to only do this stuff on those requests/
[17:18:14] <draginx> it works with "json" but not "myjson" for the $.ajaxTransport first argument
[17:18:27] <draginx> no but i added a console.log right above that :)
[17:19:01] <gnarf> and the prefilter, is it properly setting the dataType ?
[17:19:18] <draginx> yup let me re-paste
[17:19:28] <gnarf> just edit the last one :)
[17:19:43] <draginx> https://gist.github.com/0c83370dfa1c049b05e6
[17:20:13] <gnarf> is that if matching ? also, I doubt you're setting the options.myjson unless you did that globally somewhere
[17:20:35] <gnarf> line 2 - is it setting that dataType
[17:21:13] <draginx> ok removed it
[17:21:15] <draginx> still no go
[17:21:26] <gnarf> removed?
[17:21:26] <draginx> using jq 1.8.2
[17:21:31] <draginx> yeah rmeoved the if block
[17:22:23] <draginx> dataType is myjson
[17:22:32] <draginx> when i console.log(options) under the if block for prefilter
[17:22:46] <matxinada> Anyone can help me with this code? Why don't works http://jsfiddle.net/nKXmw/5/
[17:23:02] <gnarf> aha
[17:23:09] <gnarf> draginx: you need to return the opts in the prefilter
[17:23:14] <gnarf> the modified opts
[17:23:37] <draginx> "return options;" tried that
[17:23:40] <gnarf> draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/QnvC8/
[17:23:52] <draginx> ooo
[17:23:55] <draginx> ur returning datatype
[17:24:10] <gnarf> oops
[17:24:16] <gnarf> thats actually not what i meant to do
[17:24:18] <gnarf> lemme figure this out
[17:24:34] <draginx> works! :) awesome thanks
[17:24:56] <draginx> although I get "ReferenceError: XDomainRequest is not defined:
[17:25:01] <draginx> hmm
[17:25:15] <draginx> oh im an idiot
[17:25:28] <gnarf> aha draginx: "The $.ajaxPrefilter() method can also redirect a request to another dataType by returning that dataType"
[17:25:33] <gnarf> thats what was happening
[17:26:28] <draginx> :) thanks!
[17:26:55] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/QnvC8/1/
[17:31:11] <gnarf> draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/QnvC8/2/
[17:31:19] <gnarf> draginx: digging in a little further for a minimal example
[17:31:44] <draginx> oh this is awesome
[17:31:44] <draginx> thanks
[17:45:03] <gnarf> draginx: its getting kind of confusing with this dataType mapping
[17:45:12] <gnarf> what are you actually trying to do to these requests btw?
[17:45:16] <matxinada> Anyone can help me with this code? Why don't works http://jsfiddle.net/nKXmw/5/
[17:46:01] <draginx> gnarf: basically if any request (thats JSON) has an "error" key, display it via alert() and then never execute the object's done() function
[17:46:05] <draginx> is this possible?
[17:46:17] <draginx> Like I said, it's not a public website, I'm not concered about standards, Im not concerned about IE, etc.
[17:47:19] <draginx> gnarf: is this possible with just ajaxSuccess() ? :/
[17:47:52] <gnarf> draginx: you could do that with a preFilter
[17:47:58] <draginx> oh?
[17:48:11] <draginx> uhhh "error" form the responseText
[17:48:18] <draginx> not from the user sending that into data: {}
[17:48:25] <alexr2> matxinada, that's not how you use $.each
[17:48:30] <draginx> I guess the termonology "prefilter" really screwed me up :/
[17:48:45] <alexr2> ?each @ matxinada
[17:48:45] <bot-t> matxinada, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[17:49:09] <gnarf> draginx: well, basically what you want to do is pipe all of your requests - do you only attach done/fail callbacks, or do you pass some in in the options?
[17:49:23] <draginx> uhhh
[17:49:26] <draginx> I
[17:49:36] <draginx> I'm like 99.9% sure its only used with $.post()
[17:49:49] <draginx> so no options, other than sending $.post paramters?
[17:50:10] <matxinada> alexr2:  If I change the label caption for another, if it works
[17:50:18] <gnarf> draginx: so
[17:50:51] <gnarf> draginx: this is an argument for not using jQuery.post() as the entry point here - back yourself into default corners :)
[17:51:07] <draginx> ah feck.. is it impossible to use .post()?
[17:51:11] <draginx> to be fair this isnt my code
[17:51:50] <alexr2> Hmm... actually nevermind on my comment... i remember it always being $.each(selector,function()...
[17:53:17] <matxinada> alexr2: sorry, if I change the label caption for another, it works
[17:53:56] <alexr2> matxinada: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/caption
[17:54:04] <alexr2> caption element must have table as the parent
[17:55:41] <draginx> gnarf: so don't use $.post() ever?
[17:55:45] <draginx>  slash it's impossible? :p
[17:56:06] <phiz> hmm when you have a serialized set of form elements in a var what is the most elegant way of sending a GET with those variables back to the server?
[17:56:37] <alexr2> phiz, just send it to the server as the object if you can
[17:57:00] <phiz> the data object?
[17:57:06] <alexr2> phiz, yes
[17:57:12] <phiz> ahh that is too easy.
[17:57:15] <alexr2> :-)
[17:57:16] <phiz> thanks
[17:57:23] <alexr2> No problem
[17:58:46] <gnarf> draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/QnvC8/5/
[17:58:54] <matxinada> alexr2: but why the jQuery code does not work with other labels caption yes? http://jsfiddle.net/nKXmw/6/
[17:59:06] <gnarf> draginx: so, one of the methods I know works with ".done" and ".fail" but not with the callbacks from $.post
[17:59:56] <alexr2> matxinada, it's working as you programmed it.  The elements that are appearing are the first one and the 4th-6th one.
[18:01:36] <alexr2> Can you see why it's happening, or would you like me to explain?
[18:01:42] <matxinada> alexr2: Yes, but if the label is <caption> it not work.
[18:02:01] <gnarf> draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/QnvC8/6/
[18:02:09] <gnarf> draginx: i think thats what you want ^^^^
[18:02:40] <alexr2> Okay.  It will not work with caption unless you put <table></table> around all of it.  Having just <caption> elements without <table> as the parent of them is not proper formatting, and jQuery will not capture it.
[18:03:19] <gnarf> draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/QnvC8/7/
[18:03:29] <gnarf> draginx: with comments :)
[18:03:30] <draginx> :D 7 times a charm!
[18:03:31] <draginx> lets see
[18:04:11] <gnarf> oops
[18:04:19] <gnarf> need to return the data in the non-error case
[18:04:29] <draginx> gnarf: could i just return false?
[18:04:33] <draginx> oh :S
[18:04:37] <vladikoff> great work gnarf
[18:04:48] <coder7of9> i need to get the text of a selected option in a select control please
[18:05:20] <alexr2> :selected and .val()
[18:05:32] <coder7of9> not the value but the text
[18:05:42] <alexr2> then .text()?
[18:05:50] <coder7of9> i tried $('$id').text()
[18:05:56] <coder7of9> it shoudl work right?
[18:06:07] <coder7of9> rather i tried $('#id').text()
[18:06:14] <alexr2> depends what #id is
[18:06:16] <draginx> gnarf: it seems to always fail? O-o
[18:06:19] <alexr2> jsfiddle.net
[18:06:25] <coder7of9> moment
[18:08:01] <gnarf> draginx: one sec
[18:08:11] <coder7of9> ah good thanks.
[18:08:31] <alexr2> I'm going to assume that #id is the id of the select, not the option.  That is why it's not working.  The selector needs to be option:selected
[18:09:51] <matxinada> alexr2: now hidden too much! http://jsfiddle.net/nKXmw/6/
[18:10:35] <alexr2> matxinada, what is your overall goal?  It's doing what you programmed it to do right now
[18:10:46] <alexr2> You're making it hide duplicates
[18:12:43] <matxinada> alexr2:  But there are three duplicates. the other three are not. And hide all.
[18:13:29] <alexr2> You want to hide anything that is a duplicate and not leave the original?
[18:14:31] <matxinada> alexr2: I want to keep the different, and duplicates only one.
[18:14:56] <gnarf> draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/QnvC8/9/
[18:14:59] <alexr2> You are already doing that? I'm confused...
[18:15:03] <gnarf> draginx: apparently when you override the data type like that
[18:15:10] <gnarf> it trys to convert it BACK to json
[18:15:31] <gnarf> so it goes json -> myjson -> json
[18:16:31] <gnarf> vladikoff: sticky situation there :)
[18:17:12] <djsounds02> ANybody about?
[18:17:24] <gnarf> the converters["myjson json"] = true - tells ajax that myjson is already in json format and not to map it
[18:17:35] <gnarf> but it was failing trying to parse the object as a json string
[18:17:39] <gnarf> [object Object] :)
[18:18:05] <djsounds02> anybody know why my innerHeight isn't working? http://littleideasdesign.co.uk/previous-clients/
[18:18:32] <djsounds02> http://littleideasdesign.co.uk/wp-content/themes/lid/js/custom.js
[18:19:37] <matxinada> alexr2: sorry. should hide captions or content of the caption?
[18:19:47] <alexr2> djsounds02, be a little more precise please, what about it isn't working?
[18:20:13] <alexr2> matxinada, .hide() will make the entire element display:none
[18:20:38] <djsounds02> sorry, the height declared is the same on all 4 boxes but the content is different
[18:22:02] <matxinada> alexr2: What code should be for the result to be Astelehena, asteazkena, osteguna, ostirala?
[18:22:11] <gnarf> vladikoff: plus, I'm always into figuring out wtf julian was thinking inside jQuery.ajax source ;)
[18:22:26] <vladikoff> gnarf, hehe :)
[18:22:32] <gnarf> this converters data type thing kinda makes way more sense now
[18:22:43] <alexr2> matxinada, you understand that IS the result that you're getting, right?
[18:23:01] <djsounds02> alexr2: did you see my reply
[18:23:24] <alexr2> djsounds02, getting innerheight that way will only get the first element's inner height
[18:23:31] <alexr2> you have to do a loop if you want it different for each one
[18:23:49] <djsounds02> alexr2: how would I do that?
[18:24:07] <alexr2> ?each @ djsounds02
[18:24:07] <bot-t> djsounds02, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[18:24:41] <matxinada> alexr2: sorry, my fault, failure of update
[18:24:48] <matxinada> thank you
[18:24:52] <alexr2> No problem :-)
[18:25:56] <alexr2> Also matxinada, this is how caption will work: http://jsfiddle.net/nKXmw/7/
[18:26:16] <djsounds02> alexr2: will you guide me through getting it implementing
[18:26:25] <djsounds02> implemented*
[18:26:56] <alexr2> I can show you an example of how it should work if you'd like
[18:27:43] <djsounds02> I have just tried to put it in
[18:27:49] <djsounds02> http://littleideasdesign.co.uk/wp-content/themes/lid/js/custom.js
[18:28:12] <alexr2> naah, just on the part where you're doing the animation
[18:29:11] <djsounds02> erm ok, bare with me if the results look stupid I am crap at jQuery
[18:29:46] <alexr2> No worries, give me a minute to show you an example
[18:30:25] <gnarf> draginx: did I lose you? :)
[18:30:59] <dualcore> is there a jquery solution for streaming video?
[18:32:27] <djsounds02> alexr2: http://pastebin.com/81q9mxbP
[18:37:44] <alexr2> djsounds02: http://jsfiddle.net/ypQY5/
[18:37:52] <alexr2> play with that for a bit, and you should see how it works
[18:40:56] <legalize> hi
[18:41:04] <legalize> anyone here?
[18:41:21] <legalize> I have a simple question about DOM ready handlers
[18:41:43] <alexr2> legalize, better option is to just ask your question :-P
[18:42:05] <legalize> alexr2: well, I've seen more than one IRC channel with everyone lurking and not talking, so thanks for letting me know you're alive
[18:43:19] <legalize> ok, so if I do $(function() { /* first thing */ }); and then later in the document I have $(function() { /* second thing */ }); is there a guarantee that the first code is executed first?
[18:43:41] <legalize> i.e. first load handler is setup and then 2nd load handler is added and when the dom is loaded they are called in the order registered?
[18:43:48] <gnarf> legalize: yes
[18:43:50] <alexr2> ^^
[18:43:57] <gnarf> the execute in the order they are bound
[18:44:25] <legalize> cool, that's what I thought, but I wanted to make sure before depending on it
[18:45:25] <legalize> thanks for the assist; http://manx.codeplex.com is my OSS project using jquery in case anyone cares to look :)
[18:45:36] <djsounds02> alexr2: http://pastebin.com/YFXDP2JC  still not working :(
[18:47:51] <alexr2> djsounds02, inside the each loop, you need to use jQuery(this) instead of jQuery('.projectDesc'), and at that point, everything else also needs to be relative
[18:49:14] <djsounds02> erm
[18:51:27] <alexr2> So use things like .find(), .closest(), and .siblings() for finding the boxgrid400 elements and cover elements
[18:51:53] <djsounds02> wow your going really past my skillset here alexr2
[18:52:56] <alexr2> .find(selector) will find all elements going down into the tree of the element you're currently in.  .closest(selector) will go up the tree (to things like parents), and .siblings(selector) will look for things on the same level
[18:52:57] <b-ot> alexr2, no YOU'RE currently in.  .closest(selector) will go up the tree (to things like parents), and .siblings(selector) will look for things on the same level
[18:53:42] <alexr2> uhh what now?
[18:54:47] <djsounds02> I'm lost
[18:55:16] <alexr2> Okay.  here we go.  You know what loops are correct?
[18:55:45] <djsounds02> a wordpress loop yes
[18:55:54] <alexr2> I'm talking javascript loop
[18:55:55] <djsounds02> like a cycle
[18:56:03] <djsounds02> it would cycle through the information
[18:56:07] <alexr2> Right, same concept
[18:56:24] <alexr2> the jQuery.each() loop does the same thing, over a set of elements in the DOM
[18:56:53] <alexr2> You can read up on the jquery each loop here... ?each @ djsounds02
[18:56:56] <alexr2> ?each @ djpretzel
[18:56:56] <bot-t> djpretzel, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[18:56:58] <alexr2> blah
[18:57:04] <alexr2> that was meant for you djsounds02
[18:57:47] <alexr2> During the function(){} part of that loop, $(this) refers to the element it's currently on, so lets say the first div with class projectDesc
[18:57:51] <alexr2> following me so far?
[18:57:58] <djsounds02> this seems like a big job and something thats fgoing to go over my ahead and its 2 am
[18:58:20] <alexr2> Okay, some other time then
[18:58:32] <alexr2> I recommend reading up on general javascript and html before you move into jquery
[18:58:36] <djsounds02> yeah.. maybe I'll just have to leave it
[18:58:45] <alexr2> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript
[18:58:53] <djsounds02> html css and php I'm fine with I can never get jquery though
[18:58:53] <alexr2> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/html
[18:59:08] <alexr2> jQuery is built on javascript, you should know javascript before you know jQuery
[18:59:21] <alexr2> it's like learning how to walk before learning how to run
[18:59:32] <djsounds02> yeah I get you
[18:59:52] <djsounds02> is it a hard job that thing I'm trying to achieve?
[18:59:57] <alexr2> It's not too hard
[19:00:05] <alexr2> Just need to get some concepts down before you can do it
[19:00:07] <djsounds02> I just need to get it working or do something different
[19:00:50] <djsounds02> would it be hard for you to do in the mean while?
[19:01:10] <alexr2> I could get it done pretty quickly, but that's not what this channel is about :-P
[19:01:18] <alexr2> We're here to help you learn :-)
[19:01:33] <djsounds02> I appreciate that
[19:02:02] <djsounds02> from the code I put together and understand though, adding code to it would help me to see
[19:02:21] <djsounds02> thats how I've always learnt developing, from seeing things
[19:03:01] <alexr2> If you want someone to code for you, there's plenty of websites that offer freelancers for development
[19:05:14] <djsounds02> that would involve paying somebody right?
[19:05:27] <alexr2> Generally someone writing code for you involves some sort of payment
[19:06:12] <tw2113> pointing to documentation resources should be pretty free though
[19:06:24] <alexr2> As I've done :-)
[19:06:29] <djsounds02> hi tw
[19:07:15] <gnarf> djsounds02: https://gist.github.com/ec331fae28d8fb093848
[19:07:33] <alexr2> lol gnarf
[19:07:36] <gnarf> djsounds02: if I understand what you're trying to do properly
[19:08:12] <alexr2> Or gnarf can just code for you, that works too
[19:09:00] <staykov> hey, i m trying to get the dom element that started a .click event
[19:09:12] <staykov> from what i understand it should be event.target
[19:09:22] <staykov> but it seems to be undefined
[19:09:27] <staykov> http://api.jquery.com/event.target
[19:09:48] <gnarf> djsounds02: also, note that inside the each, "this" === "project"
[19:09:58] <gnarf> djsounds02: just the way each works
[19:13:08] <djsounds02> gnarf, that doesnt work though?
[19:13:14] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[19:13:14] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[19:13:27] <gnarf> also ?demo
[19:13:36] <gnarf> djsounds02: er also see ?demo
[19:13:36] <bot-t> djsounds02, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:13:38] <gnarf> ;)
[19:13:52] <gnarf>  /cc @alexr2 on the formatting
[19:13:56] <djsounds02>  http://littleideasdesign.co.uk/previous-clients/
[19:14:15] <alexr2> ahh, gotta have the : huh?
[19:14:39] <djsounds02> there is no animation
[19:14:52] <gnarf> alexr2: yeah, also "see" -- see ?glwt
[19:14:53] <bot-t> alexr2, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[19:14:57] <alexr2> djsounds02, i'm assuming you meant '+'+height+'px'
[19:15:03] <alexr2> not +height+'px'
[19:15:06] <gnarf> djsounds02: okay, so the .peek thing
[19:15:08] <gnarf> is a parent
[19:15:33] <gnarf> djsounds02: so instead of .find( ".boxgrid400.peek" ) - you need to use ?closest
[19:15:34] <bot-t> djsounds02, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[19:15:39] <gnarf> alexr2: "use" also works
[19:15:39] <gnarf> :)
[19:15:50] <gnarf> so find looks down
[19:15:51] <alexr2> jeez... this bot will never cease to surprise me
[19:15:52] <gnarf> closest looks up
[19:15:55] <alexr2> there's like 500 unwritten commands
[19:16:41] <gnarf> djsounds02: updated https://gist.github.com/ec331fae28d8fb093848
[19:17:13] <gnarf> djsounds02: P.S. you have surprisingly well organized HTML/CSS here
[19:17:14] <gnarf> +1
[19:17:38] <djsounds02> thankyou
[19:17:41] <djsounds02> surprisingly?
[19:17:58] <djsounds02> JS is just a huddle for me, the rest ive been doing for some years
[19:18:09] <alexr2> djsounds02, generally doing html means you're doing javascript
[19:18:14] <djsounds02> oh
[19:18:39] <alexr2> I guess it's not really necessary, but it's uncommon nowadays that you aren't doing one if you're doing the other
[19:18:41] <alexr2> imo
[19:18:48] <djsounds02> gnarf: still nothing :(
[19:18:54] <gnarf> djsounds02: suprisingly in that most people showing up asking for support can't select anything because the HTML is terrible :)
[19:19:06] <djsounds02> ah ok!
[19:19:08] <staykov> hey, i m trying to get the dom element that started a .click event
[19:19:13] <gnarf> djsounds02: is it live?
[19:19:14] <staykov> from what i understand it should be event.target
[19:19:26] <djsounds02> it is!
[19:19:33] <alexr2> ?demo @ staykov
[19:19:34] <bot-t> staykov, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:19:47] <staykov> ok...
[19:20:01] <alexr2> Can't help you without an example :-)
[19:20:28] <gnarf> djsounds02: what line of code/in what file is this JS showing up on?
[19:20:47] <djsounds02> http://littleideasdesign.co.uk/wp-content/themes/lid/js/custom.js
[19:20:49] <staykov> http://jsfiddle.net/UGRHQ/
[19:20:51] <djsounds02> maybe 20 lines down
[19:20:56] <staykov> it says that .target is undefined
[19:21:54] <gnarf> so djsounds02 - chrome developer tools:
[19:21:55] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/363y0c262a2D
[19:22:00] <gnarf> djsounds02: cover isn't being found
[19:22:28] <gnarf> where is cover?
[19:22:48] <gnarf> aha
[19:22:49] <alexr2> Working example is preferable, but okay.  What is your goal for this?
[19:22:54] <gnarf> it is also, not in the .projectDesc
[19:23:13] <staykov> alexr2: i want to grab the url of the link that was clicked and pass it to an ajax request
[19:23:17] <djsounds02> so need to get closest again
[19:24:16] <alexr2> staykov: http://jsfiddle.net/UGRHQ/1/
[19:24:31] <gnarf> djsounds02: so check out https://gist.github.com/ec331fae28d8fb093848
[19:24:38] <gnarf> djsounds02: thats actually not a closest
[19:24:48] <gnarf> because its not a parent of the projectDesc
[19:25:16] <gnarf> but it IS a child of the boxgrid, so if you find that first (using closest) you can look for the cover using find
[19:26:49] <gnarf> djsounds02: it might make more sense to do the each on the .boxgrid400 instead of the .projectDesc
[19:26:57] <staykov> thanks alexr2
[19:27:02] <gnarf> but maybe you had a reason for doing it from the projectDesc?
[19:27:12] <alexr2> staykov, no problem
[19:29:18] <djsounds02> hmm gnarf? still nothing ReferenceError: element is not defined
[19:29:19] <djsounds02> var boxgrid = element.closest(".boxgrid400.peek");
[19:29:43] <gnarf> sorry
[19:29:46] <gnarf> i renamed that project
[19:29:48] <gnarf> forgot to change it
[19:29:59] <gnarf> there are two elements
[19:30:05] <gnarf> er "element"
[19:30:21] <gnarf> makes more sense if you name the variable a bit more specifically sometimes
[19:30:42] <gnarf> djsounds02: updated
[19:30:57] <djsounds02> I just wanted the height of the projectDesc so it grows to the right of the content, I guess it would make more sense to do it from the first div class
[19:32:24] <gnarf> djsounds02: updated again https://gist.github.com/ec331fae28d8fb093848
[19:32:27] <djsounds02> great it works
[19:32:35] <djsounds02> again since the last one?
[19:32:53] <gnarf> djsounds02: to each on the .peek instead of the project
[19:33:51] <djsounds02> not defined var projectHeight = element.innerHeight();
[19:34:06] <gnarf> okay
[19:34:10] <gnarf> i assume you can fix that
[19:34:19] <gnarf> :)
[19:36:15] <gnarf> (if not, i updated it)
[19:36:21] <djsounds02> Yes I did thanks
[19:36:30] <gnarf> djsounds02: no prob
[19:36:31] <djsounds02> element needed changing to project
[19:36:36] <gnarf> djsounds02: see ?101
[19:36:36] <bot-t> djsounds02, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[19:36:46] <gnarf> djsounds02: also see ?learn
[19:36:47] <bot-t> djsounds02, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[19:37:33] <djsounds02> gnarf: I am understanding it more now, for example, var boxgrid =  would be like the equivalent in php to $foo =
[19:37:59] <gnarf> pretty much, except "var" is also declaring the variable
[19:38:15] <gnarf> it's only needed once per function
[19:38:39] <gnarf> djsounds02: read up on those links if you feel like learning more - all 3 are pretty great resources for javascript/jquery
[19:38:53] <gnarf> and there is always http://api.jquery.com too
[19:39:25] <gnarf> most uses boil down to: select something, and bind some events, perhaps manipulate or animate some things.
[19:39:45] <gnarf> traversing is pretty important too
[19:39:48] <gnarf> as far as api goes
[19:40:04] <djsounds02> I do deffinately want to learn more as I do love jQuery, its been like my next thing to learn for like 6months I have ADHD though, so getting round to things is a real problem of mine
[19:40:46] <djsounds02> I'll learn jQuery/JavaScript before anything else though
[19:41:57] <oojacoboo> is there anything like is_callable in js?
[19:42:41] <gnarf> oojacoboo: typeof something === "function" ???
[19:42:47] <gnarf> oojacoboo: also see ?jQuery.isFunction
[19:42:48] <bot-t> oojacoboo, jQuery.isFunction(obj): Determine if the argument passed is a Javascript function object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isFunction/
[19:42:56] <oojacoboo> mmm
[19:43:03] <gnarf> oojacoboo: the code for that is pretty terse
[19:43:15] <oojacoboo> gnarf: if that's undefined will it throw an exception?
[19:43:35] <gnarf> oojacoboo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L398-400
[19:43:45] <gnarf> bot-t: js typeof undefined
[19:43:48] <oojacoboo> lol
[19:43:50] <bot-t> gnarf: "undefined"
[19:43:53] <djsounds02> gnarf: Thankyou anyway, I best get myself off to bed! alexr2 Thankyou for all your time I promise to you I will learn
[19:43:56] <oojacoboo> gnarf: yea, that should do
[19:43:58] <gnarf> bot-t: js typeof function(){}
[19:43:58] <bot-t> gnarf: "function"
[19:43:58] <oojacoboo> thanks
[19:44:25] <gnarf> bot-t: js typeof new Function("a","");
[19:44:25] <bot-t> gnarf: "function"
[19:44:44] <alexr2> djsounds02, I recommend hanging out in here as well, you learn a surprising amount just reading what goes on in the channel
[19:45:06] <gnarf> alexr2++ - it's how I learned jQuery :)
[19:45:30] <djsounds02> alexr2: yeah I come in here quite often, I'm in the css one and wordpress one quite often too, I like to help in the wordpress one
[19:45:51] <oojacoboo> js if(typeof new Function("a", "") == "undefined") print "yes";
[19:46:14] <oojacoboo> prob don't have permissions for the bot-t ?
[19:46:57] <oojacoboo> js if(typeof new Function("a", "") == "function") print "yes";
[19:47:03] <oojacoboo> :/
[19:47:14] <gnarf> ?js "boo"

[19:48:18] <bot-t> gnarf, You may rely on it.
[19:55:25] <gnarf> djsounds02: I've been lurking wordpress-dev for a bit, but never checked out #wordpress - is the community over there pretty decent?
[19:56:50] <djsounds02> gnarf: its fantastic yeah, very active all the time!

[20:00:51] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/QnvC8/9/
[20:01:54] <draginx> ahh interesting approach
[20:01:59] <draginx> thank you very much :)
[20:02:03] <draginx> I wish there was a way to tip (!)
[20:02:12] <gnarf> draginx: https://www.gittip.com/gnarf37/ ?
[20:02:16] <gnarf> :)
[20:02:19] <draginx> oh very cool
[20:02:26] <alexr2> hahaha gnarf, that's awesome

[20:03:02] <gnarf> draginx: gnarf@gnarf.net
[20:03:07] <gnarf> draginx: skip the middle man ;)

[20:03:21] <gnarf> help pay my netflix bill
[20:03:22] <gnarf> :)
[20:03:33] <draginx> ur not that good ;) lol jk but brb :)
[20:03:33] <gnarf> draginx: gittip is cool when you already have money on it
[20:04:14] <gnarf> alexr2: gittip? its a neat concept, but the business behind it is kinda strange
[20:04:24] <gnarf> like, the way you add money then spread it
[20:04:32] <gnarf> not very "transaction" based
[20:07:35] <gnarf> hey djsounds02 just fyi
[20:08:30] <djsounds02> ..
[20:08:37] <gnarf> djsounds02: if you want to animate colors - add jQuery Color - or jQuery UI effects core (which includes color)
[20:09:04] <djsounds02> how easy is that
[20:09:27] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[20:09:29] <djsounds02> I'd prefer the color thing in jQuery css3 isnt widely supported
[20:10:13] <gnarf> djsounds02: its supported enough though
[20:10:20] <gnarf> djsounds02: everywhere it's important it works
[20:10:22] <djsounds02> looks pretty cool I'll check it out thanks
[20:10:22] <gnarf> IE9+
[20:10:31] <alexr2> I think it's time for the entire community to drop support for browsers that don't support css3/html5 :-P
[20:10:51] <gnarf> djsounds02: and wherever it isn't supported, you just get quick transitions which are probably better on an older browser anyway :)
[20:10:58] <djsounds02> Yeah I mean its only a transition I'd love anyway in regards to site,
[20:11:02] <djsounds02> lose*
[20:11:13] <djsounds02> yeah
[20:11:21] <djsounds02> thanks for that though :)
[20:11:41] <djsounds02> I need to get some sleep though told the partner id be to bed an hour ago!
[20:11:50] <gnarf> p.s. one of the coolest css3 animation demos i've seen in a long long time: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/K8cma/
[20:12:02] <djsounds02> thanks again for all your help drop me an email if you'd like to keep in touch
[20:13:10] <djsounds02> Yeah thats cool
[20:13:36] <djsounds02> gnarf: g'night!
[20:13:55] <djsounds02> happy to return the favours with wordpress dev any time
[20:23:33] <tw2113> of course it's webkit only gnarf
[20:32:36] <ShawnRisk> hi
[20:50:43] <coder7of9> i need to access this in the success method  (attr).click() function(){  ajax... success(data) need this here this being the field clicked }
[21:01:18] <danheberden> coder7of9: way
[21:01:20] <danheberden> *wat
[21:01:32] <danheberden> what the hell is (attr).click()
[21:02:58] <spronk> hi all - anyone got any examples of lightbox / modal dialogue plugins that don't use any external assets (i.e. no css/image)
[21:04:31] <coder7of9> (id).click sorry
[21:05:28] <coder7of9> spronk yo could put everything inline including the images.
[21:06:57] <danheberden> coder7of9: so, like, cache that shit, ya?
[21:07:25] <danheberden> var $thing = $('#yourId').on('click', function(){ /* your ajax shit that uses $thing */ });
[21:07:56] <oojacoboo> anyone using underscore.js with jQuery?
[21:07:58] <danheberden> or, more simply, `var $thing = $('#whatever'); $thing.on( 'click', function(){...
[21:08:02] <danheberden> oojacoboo: fo sho
[21:08:12] <danheberden> specially with, like, backbone.js
[21:08:16] <oojacoboo> yea, I'm thinking about loading it in
[21:08:29] <oojacoboo> danheberden: unfortunately we're too far along for backbone
[21:08:37] <oojacoboo> it'd require a lot of reworking
[21:08:37] <danheberden> oojacoboo: i mean, assuming you need it
[21:08:51] <danheberden> oojacoboo: totes, just saying it's not that crazy
[21:08:57] <oojacoboo> right
[21:10:33] <coder7of9> success: $.proxy(function(response){this.styel.display='none'},this)  was the solution
[21:10:35] <danheberden> oojacoboo: also, don't use "underscore"
[21:10:36] <danheberden> use lodash
[21:10:43] <oojacoboo> ?
[21:10:47] <danheberden> ?g lodash
[21:10:48] <bot-t> danheberden, Lo-Dash - http://lodash.com/
[21:10:54] <danheberden> same api, but better
[21:10:54] <coder7of9> jquery trades overhead for convenience.
[21:11:04] <coder7of9> but it is still javascript
[21:11:05] <oojacoboo> danheberden: mmm
[21:11:12] <danheberden> coder7of9: that is *A* solution
[21:11:18] <danheberden> you forget you're using javascript
[21:11:31] <danheberden> you're adding function calls instead of taking advantage of scope
[21:11:33] <coder7of9> then you forget javascript
[21:11:47] <danheberden> whatevs man, do it your way :)
[21:11:54] <oojacoboo> danheberden: is underscore not maintained?
[21:11:59] <oojacoboo> what's the point of the fork
[21:12:11] <abjorn> it's maintained
[21:12:14] <danheberden> oojacoboo: it is, but there's some things that lodash does that is more sensible; like custom methods instead of native
[21:12:18] <abjorn> and it's not exactly a fork
[21:12:23] <danheberden> handling sparse arrays
[21:12:28] <abjorn> the intent is to be a faster replacement
[21:12:36] <danheberden> and, jdalton is crazy OCD abou tit
[21:12:41] <danheberden> *about it
[21:12:56] <danheberden> so you know it's getting, like, ferverent review
[21:12:56] <oojacoboo> I just wish people would join together on these things
[21:12:57] <abjorn> it's underscore but faster due to how anal..ahem, how attentive, jdalton is
[21:13:03] <danheberden> oojacoboo: they tried
[21:13:04] <oojacoboo> instead of rolling out another copy
[21:13:07] <oojacoboo> danheberden: ah
[21:13:16] <abjorn> from what I understand underscore would have none o' dat
[21:13:17] <danheberden> god what is that issue #?
[21:13:27] <abjorn> which is silly, really
[21:13:40] <abjorn> a library like underscore could very much use the performance improvements
[21:14:38] <oojacoboo> how are updates maintained?
[21:14:52] <oojacoboo> I'm assuming the version numbers aren't in sync
[21:15:07] <abjorn> lodash is just a separate project in general
[21:15:17] <oojacoboo> ah
[21:15:29] <danheberden> but designed to work as a drop in replacement
[21:15:36] <oojacoboo> right, so you can move over
[21:15:52] <oojacoboo> but that won't continue to be the case
[21:16:06] <oojacoboo> cross compat that is
[21:16:40] <abjorn> I've been using lodash for a few months now and it works well for me
[21:16:58] <oojacoboo> abjorn: I just question where we'll be in 3 years ;)
[21:17:01] <abjorn> compatible enough to work with backbone so
[21:17:08] <abjorn> which I'm guessing is the main goal
[21:17:11] <abjorn> one of them, anyways
[21:17:13] <abjorn> in terms of compat
[21:19:16] <danheberden> abjorn: aye, works with all of my weird uses as well ;)
[21:20:51] <abjorn> ya
[22:07:52] <draginx> gnarf: netflix paid for! ;) :D
[22:19:00] <dns-away> hi
[22:20:13] <dns-away> anyone for question
[22:21:45] <shifteleven> ask and maybe there shall be an answer
[22:25:10] <draginx> gnarf: any idea why my ajax would just stop freeze up chrome? :S
[22:33:42] <gnarf> draginx: thanks appreciated, and nope - no idea - try the profiler?
[22:33:55] <draginx> profiler? hmm
[22:34:32] <gnarf> draginx: it might be getting stuck in an infinite loop of some sort
[22:34:34] <danheberden> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiler_(TV_series)
[22:34:37] <gnarf> that would be my only guess
[22:36:16] <draginx> doesnt even show up in the profiler
[22:38:31] <gnarf> draginx: so what do you mean by "freeze up" then?
[22:38:39] <draginx> like it crashes my chrome
[22:38:43] <draginx> i think its just chrome though.. hold on
[22:38:48] <gnarf> doesn't sound right...
[22:38:51] <shifteleven> chrome? or just the tab?
[22:39:03] <draginx> just the tab
[22:39:07] <gnarf> ?demo
[22:39:07] <gnarf> ?
[22:39:08] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:41:24] <draginx> yeah I resstarted chrome and it works fine now
[22:45:14] <draginx> ty sir
[23:09:39] <danheberden> holy net split
[23:26:32] <codeshah> how do I best setup forms in a view controller?
