[13:17:11] <thomas_25> when you do console.log($(selector)), each elemenet of the array is pretty printed as such `tag.Class1.Class2.Class3`
[13:17:26] <thomas_25> but toString on the element does not generate that. What does generate that?
[13:17:42] <thomas_25> I guess it's console.log's feature?
[18:10:38] <robertmaxrees> thomas_25 console.log is just showing you the jquery object (which isn't an array, but array-like) however that particular browser has implemented console.log :)
