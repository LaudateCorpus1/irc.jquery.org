[02:25:23] <siva_> Hi
[02:25:34] <siva_> Greg
[02:25:52] <siva_> ????
[04:15:21] <karstenk> Good morning! I have a absolute div with width 240 and padding 5, but outerWidth() returns only 240. What Iam doing wrong?
[04:17:50] <karstenk> document.getElementById(id).offsetWidth also returns only 240
[04:24:27] <kirua> hi
[04:24:42] <kirua> i would like to fire a popup only once : https://pastebin.com/7nZp421m
[04:24:46] <kirua> i tried that
[04:24:49] <kirua> but its not working
[04:25:01] <kirua> once per sesison or else
[04:37:37] <AdamPDotty> meaning you want to react to button click just once?
[04:43:03] <ryan_ford> I've tried a bunch of different selectors to get the root element. ':root', document.documentElement, 'html'
[04:46:10] <AdamPDotty> karstenk: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-sizing.asp
[04:46:26] <AdamPDotty> ryan_ford: good for you
[04:46:57] <ryan_ford> i got d/c'd did you see the other messages?
[04:47:02] <ryan_ford> I'm still a little stuck
[04:50:37] <AdamPDotty> I am afraid I only got last.
[04:51:08] <ryan_ford> repost incoming:
[04:51:11] <ryan_ford> any idea why the commented out lines work (vanilla), but the lines above them(jQ) don't?
[04:51:19] <ryan_ford> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/f9sTnCfryj/
[04:51:24] <ryan_ford> this works, https://jsfiddle.net/ryanford/cmnopzjL/2/ but not outside of jsfiddle
[04:53:45] * AdamPDotty rummages through memory
[04:54:38] <AdamPDotty> Is it possible that document.domain is set somewhere?
[04:55:20] <ryan_ford> well with the fiddles there's generally tons of iframes, so I'm actually surprised it does work there
[04:55:28] <ryan_ford> do you mean an extension or something?
[04:59:08] <ryan_ford> i don't believe so. i just tried with addons disabled and same result
[04:59:48] <ryan_ford> and it *does* work with the normal vanilla querySelector
[05:02:42] <ryan_ford> the jQ query seems to point to the correct element if I console log it
[05:03:00] <ryan_ford> something with how the style is applied perhaps?
[05:03:18] <ryan_ford> but it's weird that it works in the fiddle
[05:55:05] <karstenk> Please can sombody help with this https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/vdtw8LILWcbHCdzgamc4pA  My problem is, when zoomed the node element is not really in center, a liitle bit left. You can check this http://pbc.tomws.ddnss.de/tournament/4?debug=assets  toggle fullscreen and click one node.
[05:55:41] <karstenk> my calculation f_x and f_y seem to miss something
[06:21:46] <ryan_ford> had to step out for a bit, I don't suppose anyone had a crack at that?
[06:50:06] <Cork> ryan_ford: you can't select the html element with a selector
[06:50:12] <Cork> ryan_ford: selectors run on body by default
[06:51:47] <Cork> (and if it isn't the default it run on child elements of the body)
[06:53:34] <Cork> karstenk: you missing that the center position changes when you scale an element, and depending on how you zoom it, the width might not
[06:54:31] <ryan_ford> try `console.log(':root')`
[06:54:35] <ryan_ford> ..)
[06:55:02] <ryan_ford> `$(':root')` -- edit
[06:57:13] <ryan_ford> I can target the html el seemingly with $(document.documentElement), $('html'), $(':root') according to the console
[06:57:39] <Cork> ryan_ford: what exactly is the question=
[06:57:42] <Cork> *?
[06:57:56] <Cork> also :root is a very new selector so be careful, cause it doesn't work in all browsers
[06:58:10] <ryan_ford> I can't seem to alter the css on :root
[06:58:30] <ryan_ford> I'm using css custom properties (variables)
[06:58:35] <Cork> uh... it isn't a stylable element...
[06:58:46] <ryan_ford> (which you apply on :root)
[06:59:25] <Cork> css has some special cases that the browser moves around to set styles on the correct place
[06:59:43] <ryan_ford> in the fiddle and the pastebin, see that the js query works fine, and it seemingly works with jQ on the second fiddle as well
[06:59:55] <ryan_ford> but I can't seem to get it to work in a normal browser environment
[07:00:36] <ryan_ford> $(document.documentElement) works in the fiddle
[07:01:35] <ryan_ford> but i suspect that might be related to it being nested iframes
[07:25:47] <hollusion> i am cloning an element on click and append it to another container
[07:26:21] <hollusion> what would be an elegant way to check if the clone already exists in the destination container?
[07:26:36] <hollusion> $('#query').find($(clone.html())).length
[07:26:43] <hollusion> was hoping this would work, but it doesnt
[07:32:06] <ryan_ford> why not give it some kind of identifier?
[07:34:08] <setre> how can I make a button that scrolls to the next h2?
[07:37:38] <Woet> setre: what have you tried so far?
[07:39:08] <setre> $(document).scrollTop($this).closest('h2').next().offset().top)
[07:39:28] <setre> undefined doesn't have an offset
[07:42:59] <bomb> setre: could you try $(window) instead of $(document)?
[07:43:08] <setre> okay sure
[07:43:56] <bomb> also if it's the exact line you wrote, scrollTop($this) should be scrollTop($this
[07:44:05] <bomb> without the closing parenthesis
[07:46:34] <setre> $(window).scrollTop($this.closest('h2').next().offset().top) gives Uncaught ReferenceError: $this is not defined
[07:48:03] <setre> wait do I need to pass the object id of the button the function?
[07:48:13] <setre> to the function
[10:48:29] <tilerendering> I have a jquery validation question (jquery validation plugin, as in https://jqueryvalidation.org/): I reset form fields but _not_ calling for the form to reset, but by selecting the class of the input fields. This way I avoid that other useful properties are erased too. But the problem is: after resetting this way, the validation error messages, if any, persist. How do I avoid that, i.e. how do I tell jquery validation plugin to refresh the
[10:48:30] <tilerendering> validation messages for this form?
[10:48:47] <jomofcw> Are you working with browser history to handle AJAX navigation ? If yes, which module do you use ?
[10:50:53] <jomofcw> Currently I'm using this one : https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/releases but not new release since 2013.
[10:55:00] <Cork> jomofcw: is the data you need in the ajax url?
[10:55:14] <Cork> if yes, you don't need a lib
[10:55:30] <Cork> just history.pushState and the popState event
[10:55:38] <Cork> it is quite simple actually
[10:56:25] <jomofcw> Hello Cork ^^ !
[10:57:09] <Cork> ello o/
[10:57:14] <jomofcw> Cork I have some load that need data from POST.
[10:57:35] <Cork> then store it in the state object pushState supports
[10:57:39] <jomofcw> From what I read, history.js still be usefull about browser compatibility.
[10:57:51] <Cork> if you need old ie ya
[10:58:09] <Cork> if you use jquery 2 or 3 then no
[10:58:12] <jomofcw> Cork sure I don't need it :P but my customer use it :/.
[10:58:22] <jomofcw> I'm using the latest 3.*
[10:58:41] <Cork> ya, so the replacement for history, is: nothing
[10:58:47] <Cork> use history.js for legacy code
[10:59:13] <Cork> anyway gtg
[10:59:52] <jomofcw> Thanks Cork :).
[11:37:20] <Iarfen> hi!
[11:37:42] <preference> o/
[11:37:53] <Iarfen> what does the following exactly $("#form")..bind("ajax:success"?
[11:41:20] <preference> idk what ajax:success does, but it will execute ajax:success if id=form has been selected
[11:55:45] <uranium[oc]70> as ajax goes through its states it hits the success state http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:55:48] <uranium[oc]70> bout half way down the page
[11:57:18] <tilerendering> jquery validation plugin: if I programmatically change the value of an input field which’s input was invalid prior to the programmatic change, its error message wont disappear. any idea how to do that?
[11:58:16] <Woet> tilerendering: https://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/
[11:58:45] <tilerendering> Woet: thank you, I know that link.
[11:58:49] <tilerendering> still asking.
[12:04:55] <Woet> tilerendering: so what did you try so far?
[12:05:38] <tilerendering> Woet: resetform, recalling the validation initiation function, etc. - but I just want the validator to reset. without reseting the form (which validator.resetform does, I checked the source code)
[12:06:22] <tilerendering> anything else? cause I think I can do it myself by just re”loading” the script now. which is the most unelegant way to do it, but it s better than to write 10 lines for that kinda stuff into irc.
[12:06:51] <Cork> Iarfen: ajax:success is an old jquery ajax event, it was depricated in 1.7 if i remember correctly
[12:06:54] <tilerendering> this should be a standard function and anybody using jquery validation plugin should be knowing this
[12:06:59] <tilerendering> thanks anyway...
[12:08:41] <Woet> tilerendering: show your test case on www.jsfiddle.net
[12:08:59] <Cork> Iarfen: now days it has been replaced with the dedicated handlers .ajaxSuccess() http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[12:09:41] <tilerendering> Woet: the question is quite clear. I programmatically change the value of a text input from an invalid value to a valid value, with $(‘#bla’).val(‘validvalue’) and I need to know how to tell the jquery validation plugin to revalidate that fiedl and update (or make disappear) the error message.
[12:09:52] <tilerendering> so do you know how to do that?
[12:09:53] <tilerendering> or not
[12:12:59] <Woet> tilerendering: I never used the plugin before but yes, I managed to do it after reading the docs.
[12:13:28] <ryan_ford> validate() ?
[12:13:53] <Woet> tilerendering: so can you please share your test case now? or at least share a pastebin with the code you tried?
[12:14:09] <tilerendering> ryan_ford: wont make the validation messages refresh
[12:14:19] <Woet> tilerendering: I did 95% of the job for you here, http://jsfiddle.net/p4q9dLq4/3/
[12:14:26] <Woet> tilerendering: now just copy/paste the code from the docs and it works.
[12:14:55] <ryan_ford> https://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/#focuscleanup
[12:14:55] <Woet> tilerendering: https://s.woet.me/CznXAeL8yu.png -> https://s.woet.me/q1GiavAblk.png
[12:15:14] <Woet> ryan_ford: thats just for the constructor, not re-validating it.
[12:15:42] <Woet> ryan_ford: then again, I just read the docs for 3 minutes, copy/pasted the code and it works, so I'm not sure whether tilerendering read the docs.
[12:16:11] <tilerendering> Woet: I m tired of getting insulted tbh.
[12:16:25] <tilerendering> of course I have the docs, and I wouldnt have been able to implement what I have if I hadnt.
[12:16:42] <Woet> tilerendering: ok, so can you please share your attempt so we can help you
[12:16:47] <Woet> tilerendering: instead of outright writing the code for you
[12:17:19] <tilerendering> Woet: I never asked you for that, but thanks. appreciated. I just need someone who knows, instead of thinking to know. and the case is very simple.
[12:17:41] <Woet> tilerendering: I already know, except this channel isn't to just give you the answer, it's to help you learn read and implement documentation
[12:17:56] <Woet> tilerendering: so can you please use my test case to make an attempt and share it with us if you're stuck?
[12:18:05] <Woet> tilerendering: so it becomes "i wrote this code but it doesnt work" rather than "just give me the answer"
[12:18:25] <tilerendering> Woet: thank you, I dont need that kind of teaching. I know what I ask for, and I m not interested in this meta conversation with you about life, self-discipline, learning, attitude, etc.
[12:18:47] <tilerendering> I have enough of that myself, thanks.
[12:19:01] <tilerendering> I jsut need an answer to what I asked for.
[12:19:28] <Woet> tilerendering: ok, then hire someone.
[12:19:40] <tilerendering> Woet: thanks, I get help without that as well.
[12:19:50] <tilerendering> it s not like the channel is only populated by you, fortunately.
[12:21:10] <Woet> tilerendering: instead of arguing for 25 minutes you could also just try to implement the documentation
[12:21:21] <Woet> tilerendering: which method did you try?
[12:21:45] <tilerendering> sure, but I could have also chosen to ignore you
[12:21:58] <tilerendering> which I did do now. maybe someone who knows can help later.
[12:22:50] <Woet> you'd think just copy/pasting https://jqueryvalidation.org/Validator.element/ would not be too difficult
[12:23:01] <Woet> seeing as i never read about this plugin until just now and figured it out after 3 minutes
[12:23:01] <Woet> oh well
[12:25:13] <ezio> is this wrong?  My success function is not getting executed; however, the request is returning 200 OK.  $.post('/schedule/crossserverservice', request, function (results) { ... }, 'application/xml');
[12:29:09] <Woet> ezio: yes, please check the dataType section: https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[12:29:17] <shoky> ezio: the last dataType argument would need to be 'xml' if you want jquery to try and parse the respons as xml
[12:29:31] <ezio> thanks
[12:29:34] <Woet> ezio: or better yet, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[12:29:35] <shoky> ezio: and if it fails parsing you'll get an error
[12:31:23] <shoky> if you add an error handler, that is
[15:01:41] <aro> i have a page that has a full screen iframe, but when on mobile - trying to scroll that scrolls the parent window of the iframe, instead of the iframe content. How do I fix that?
[15:25:18] <Levin^> hello
[15:25:24] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[15:25:29] <Levin^> I need help with my code here:
[15:25:30] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ELxOyG
[15:25:46] <Levin^> there's some instructions in the Pen
[15:25:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:26:06] <Levin^> basically, I need it to scroll the menu container as I click on the titles
[15:26:13] <robertmaxrees> horizontall?
[15:26:18] <Levin^> yes
[15:28:00] <robertmaxrees> so your first issue is $('html, body').animate({
[15:28:13] <robertmaxrees> you want to animate the container for the menu.
[15:28:27] <Levin^> oh
[15:29:31] <robertmaxrees> also slap an e.preventDefault(); in that click handler.
[15:29:39] <robertmaxrees> so it stops scrolling the page to the top.
[15:29:45] <robertmaxrees> at least for debugging.
[15:31:15] <Levin^> hm
[15:31:34] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:31:52] <Levin^> ok, if you refresh the Pen, it's modified a bit
[15:32:07] <Levin^> anything else I should do?
[15:32:08] <robertmaxrees> erm
[15:32:15] <robertmaxrees> your css says .menu-container is what has overflow: Scroll
[15:32:37] <Levin^> ohhh
[15:32:40] <Levin^> now I see
[15:32:42] <Levin^> it worked
[15:32:45] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:32:57] <Levin^> that's the selector, ok
[15:34:55] <Levin^> thx
[15:35:03] <robertmaxrees> yep
[15:36:42] <Levin^> for some reason, it won't reach the target if I click the Title twice
[15:36:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:37:27] <Levin^> when I click a second time, the animation goes back to the beginnin
[15:37:40] <robertmaxrees> well yeah.
[15:37:41] <robertmaxrees> scrollLeft: $('.menu-item-5').offset().left
[15:37:57] <robertmaxrees> you're scrolling that container to whatever the offset is for that item.
[15:38:02] <robertmaxrees> the offset changes as it scrolls.
[15:38:07] <Levin^> oh
[15:38:45] <Levin^> uhm
[15:39:15] <Levin^> so I should find another command to scroll it to the target
[15:39:37] <Levin^> should I take off offset()?
[15:39:45] <robertmaxrees> you need to calculate that part differently.
[15:41:54] <Levin^> if I get the element position() as a var, I might make it work
[15:46:13] <Levin^> I made it as position, but uhm
[15:46:22] <Levin^> it's doing the same as offset()
[15:46:22] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:46:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:46:48] <Levin^> are they the same..?
[15:46:51] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:46:54] <Levin^> uh
[15:47:09] <robertmaxrees> show me the code?
[15:47:19] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ELxOyG
[15:48:22] <robertmaxrees> so a couple thoughts.
[15:49:32] <robertmaxrees> why did you store the position/offset in the click handler?
[15:50:04] <Levin^> I wanted to track the position of the button so I could go to that position when I click the Title
[15:50:50] <Levin^> should I put that variable outside the click handler?
[15:51:14] <robertmaxrees> so first off you want position.
[15:51:31] <Levin^> oh
[15:51:34] <robertmaxrees> second off you could do that, though you'd have to map those out in some kind of format so you could retrieve each one as appropriate.
[15:51:36] <Levin^> you were right
[15:52:01] <Levin^> when I put the variable outside the handler, it started working as I needed
[15:52:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because you're storing it statically.
[15:52:56] <robertmaxrees> but that won't work for all the menu items.
[15:53:04] <Levin^> no?
[15:53:19] <robertmaxrees> you're not gonna create a new handler for each menu item, are you?
[15:53:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:53:53] <Levin^> no, I'm going to think after this, on how make it work for everybody in one handle
[15:54:24] <robertmaxrees> so one way
[15:55:48] <robertmaxrees> would be to get the element, and calculate the width of all the preceding menu items.
[15:56:44] <Levin^> width? couldn't be their position?
[15:56:54] <robertmaxrees> the position changes
[15:57:00] <robertmaxrees> that's why you were getting that bug earlier.
[15:57:04] <Levin^> oh
[15:57:07] <Levin^> hm
[15:57:10] <robertmaxrees> since you want that to be scrollable.
[15:57:17] <Levin^> ok
[15:57:21] <robertmaxrees> does it need to be scrollable?
[15:57:24] <Levin^> yes
[15:57:35] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you'd need to do something funky like that.
[15:57:42] <Levin^> lol
[15:57:44] <Levin^> hmm
[15:57:47] <robertmaxrees> though now i gotta ask: why do you have a scrollable container for menu items?
[15:58:11] <Levin^> I need a slim sticky menu for my mobile site
[15:58:40] <Levin^> using a hamburger menu for small titled items would fill a lot of space
[15:59:44] <Levin^> as the user scrolls, the menu will scroll horizontally as well
[16:00:20] <Levin^> using the Waypoints library
[16:01:02] <Levin^> which means, the menu will have an active triggering which will change toeach section of the page dinamically
[16:08:15] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was away for a second.
[16:08:21] <robertmaxrees> so
[16:08:32] <robertmaxrees> i would stick with a hamburger menu for this tbh.
[16:08:51] <robertmaxrees> or something else, since horizontal scrolling is generally something you want to avoid.
[16:09:41] <Levin^> hm
[16:10:45] <Levin^> not UX friendly you say
[16:23:52] <robertmaxrees> horizontal scrolls tend to be, yeah.
[16:39:08] <aro> i have a page that has a full screen iframe, but when on mobile - trying to scroll that scrolls the parent window of the iframe, instead of the iframe content. How do I fix that?
[16:40:20] <robertmaxrees> aro this might help.
[16:40:42] <robertmaxrees> https://davidwalsh.name/scroll-iframes-ios
[16:41:03] <aro> cool thanks, checking it out
[16:53:02] <bRinbg> How i can send here my options by call the function anyone idea? https://codepen.io/andfinally/pen/OyWGyE
[16:53:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:54:13] <aro> has anyone used google maps inside an iframe?
[16:54:14] <robertmaxrees> you mean how do you pass things to timer?
[16:55:10] <robertmaxrees> bRinbg
[16:55:25] <bRinbg> robertmaxrees: yes
[16:55:42] <robertmaxrees> the same way you would with any other function.
[16:55:54] <robertmaxrees> .timer(yourObjectHere)
[16:56:45] <bRinbg> Hmm realy, ok. Because this: I call: $('.example').timer(); -- And the function is: $.fn.timer = function( userdefinedoptions ){  -- And not function timer() {...
[16:57:07] <bRinbg> that confused me
[16:57:11] <bRinbg> :-(
[16:57:39] <bRinbg> $.fn.timer = function <-- i dont no, what this means
[16:58:03] <robertmaxrees> bRinbg that's making it so you can do $('foo').timer();
[16:58:08] <robertmaxrees> makes it a jquery method.
[16:58:37] <bRinbg> Ok thank you
[17:02:08] <bRinbg> robertmaxrees: Thanks works, i was confused from this style :-)
[20:53:54] <dodobrain> when using datatables and the associated select extension of it, how do i select a row using the .row.select api?
[20:55:15] <dodobrain> because previously i had been simply adding and removing the 'selected' class on the <tr>, this i snot correct because the underlying table has not been made aware of the selection, so if i do a .rows({selected:true}) they dont show up
[21:45:12] <jak2000> hi all
[21:45:29] <jak2000> i have this number of hours: 590.3225   how to convert to days/hours/mins?
