[00:01:52] <funnieguy> joy4u did you replace .youtubeVideo
[00:01:57] <funnieguy> with the field
[00:02:28] <funnieguy> abhvym the div should have an id
[00:02:42] <abhvym> it has
[00:02:48] <funnieguy> $("#divName").append(value);
[00:03:09] <funnieguy> to remove $("#divName").empty();
[00:03:12] <abhvym> ok
[00:04:54] <joy4u> replaced .youtubeVideo with #youtubeVideo
[00:05:15] <joy4u> funnieguy: replaced .youtubeVideo with #youtubeVideo
[00:05:55] <funnieguy> is #youtubeVideo the form or the field
[00:06:20] <joy4u> funnieguy: is the field
[00:08:06] <funnieguy> joy4u did you initialize the validate
[00:08:36] <funnieguy> $("#formId").validate()
[00:10:05] <joy4u> funnieguy: what do you mean my initialize
[00:10:20] <joy4u> funnieguy: i have initialized
[00:10:26] <funnieguy> initialize the form
[00:10:39] <funnieguy> you post all the code you have now
[00:12:19] <joy4u> funnieguy: i have solved it
[00:12:21] <joy4u> :)
[00:12:31] <funnieguy> :) what was the problem
[00:12:49] <joy4u> funnieguy: the problem was the rule was to be after the call
[00:13:21] <joy4u> funnieguy: are you a jquery guy?
[00:13:38] <jon_x2> Have two columns.  The left is a sidebar div where the user clicks. In the right hand column is a document(html) where I want to insert a <span>, on the line at the same horizontal level of the click. Any idea how I could accomplish such a thing ?
[00:14:25] <funnieguy> yes it has to be after validate
[00:14:39] <funnieguy> i use it quite a bit
[00:15:34] <joy4u> funnieguy: thats great
[00:15:59] <joy4u> funnieguy: so what is your profession?
[00:16:10] <funnieguy> i freelance web design
[00:16:14] <jon_x2> I  should say the right hand side is a text area so I can get selection and such from it
[00:16:28] <funnieguy> I am a soldier
[00:16:40] <funnieguy> I come from Singapore, we have conscription here
[00:16:55] <funnieguy> but i don't hold guns I have a heart problem and I get to go home everyday
[00:17:11] <jon_x2> but I can't find a way to simulate a click in the text area that selects text (i.e. simulate a click X pixels over from the left hand side bar )
[00:17:48] <funnieguy> I studied Information Security in polytechnic equivalent of high school
[00:17:52] <funnieguy> before college
[00:17:54] <funnieguy> jon_x2
[00:17:56] <funnieguy> hold on
[00:18:07] <joy4u> funnieguy: thats great dear
[00:18:37] <jon_x2> holding
[00:18:57] <joy4u> funnieguy: will like to contribute to an opensource project of mine in github? do you know angularjs?
[00:20:11] <funnieguy> jon_x2 so what is the problem simulating highlighting of text or placing a span on the mouse
[00:20:48] <funnieguy> i'll take a look
[00:22:20] <funnieguy> joy4u i'm interested in contributing to open source projects
[00:22:24] <funnieguy> actually
[00:23:09] <jon_x2> funnieguy well normally a person could double click some text in the text area, get the selection and be able to place a <span> at that point.  _BUT_ the spec I have say it needs to be a click on a sidebar, beside the text area and insert <span> on that same line
[00:23:12] <Gorakhpuriya> NimeshNeema:
[00:25:23] <funnieguy> jon_x2 there is $().trigger('mousedown')
[00:26:17] <jon_x2> funnieguy I've been trying to trigger('dblclick') but it won't select text
[00:26:45] <funnieguy> there is also a simulate plugin https://github.com/jquery/jquery-simulate
[00:26:54] <funnieguy> i'm not sure if that'll help
[00:27:26] <jon_x2> let me look at that funnieguy.. maybe there are some ideas there
[00:28:08] <funnieguy> tbh i am not so sure about the selecting text part
[00:28:34] <funnieguy> but insert span
[00:29:01] <jon_x2> funnieguy yah me either.  I think the actual text selecting is done at the browser level and not the dom level, so javascript/jquery is not going to be able to do that.
[00:29:15] <funnieguy> that's what i thought
[00:29:21] <jon_x2> funniguy once I have the text selected however.. I know how to get the position
[00:29:51] <funnieguy> okay then the position is easy
[00:30:46] <funnieguy> when you said text area do you mean a text area element or a span
[00:30:57] <jon_x2> text area element
[00:30:58] <funnieguy> <textarea>
[00:31:13] <jon_x2> its technically an html editor
[00:37:56] <jon_x2> funnieguy I think one way may be to make fake selections.. iterate through the text until the fake selection coordinates are on the same plane as the clicked div.  Kind of ugly but might work.
[00:48:33] <joy4u> funnieguy: you can have a look at the project at https://github.com/himadriganguly/user-dashboard
[00:56:13] <funnieguy> jon_x2 when you say insert <span>
[00:56:25] <funnieguy> you mean insert the text "<span>" into the textarea
[00:56:42] <jon_x2> funnieguy yes
[00:57:03] <jon_x2> funnieguy.. what I insert isn't really the problem... its trying to figure out where to insert it
[00:59:02] <monkeylob> What's the right syntax to add text to an id of an element? Trying to see if it's possible to define a variable with the text "pumpkin" being dynamic. var dynamictext = pumpkin; var combined = $('#awesome_dynamictext');
[01:01:21] <funnieguy> jon_x2 https://github.com/Codecademy/textarea-helper found this on the web
[01:02:06] <jon_x2> funnieguy very nice find.. thank you appreciate it a lot
[01:04:06] <funnieguy> i think you'll do $("#textAreaId").focus()
[01:05:04] <funnieguy> then .setSelectionRange
[01:05:48] <Bernardao> hello
[01:08:14] <Bernardao> I've got:
[01:08:14] <Bernardao> $.getJSON('/ajax/getsearchform/'+usedhash, function() {
[01:08:14] <Bernardao>     console.log("4332334");
[01:08:14] <Bernardao> })
[01:08:14] <Bernardao> .always(function(data){
[01:08:14] <Bernardao>     alert("Hello");
[01:08:15] <Bernardao>     fullsearch_form.html(data.responseText);
[01:08:15] <Bernardao> });
[01:08:15] <Bernardao> My problem is that the console log is never executed, and I don't know why
[01:08:19] <Bernardao> Any help?
[01:08:49] <Bernardao> I understand how it works and have checked and compared to others examples
[01:10:41] <funnieguy> jon_x2 the helper returns relative position to the text area which means you'll need $("#textAreaId").position().top +  .textareahelper('caretPosition').top to get the position in the window
[01:12:16] <funnieguy> bernardao
[01:12:20] <funnieguy> do you use chrome or firebug
[01:12:29] <Bernardao> ff
[01:12:32] <funnieguy> click on network tab
[01:12:35] <Bernardao> checking it in Chrome now
[01:12:57] <Bernardao> it returns OK 200
[01:12:58] <funnieguy> same
[01:13:02] <funnieguy> see the response
[01:13:39] <Bernardao> the response returns me the html I need, but can't see anything about the console log
[01:13:48] <funnieguy> oh its html
[01:13:53] <funnieguy> use $.get
[01:13:57] <funnieguy> instead of $.getJSON
[01:14:00] <Bernardao> ok
[01:14:05] <Bernardao> let me try, thank you
[01:14:19] <funnieguy> does any error show up in console
[01:14:55] <Bernardao> it's working now!!!
[01:15:01] <Bernardao> no errors on the console
[01:15:29] <Bernardao> I've been looking all around and couldnt understand it, thank you very much Funnieguy!!!
[01:28:16] <gingitsune> When i implement a check all checkbox, how can i make it so it isn't submitted?
[01:28:51] <lericson_> do not set a name attribute, gingitsune
[01:28:53] <gingitsune> Disabling it on submit would be one thing that comes to my mind? Is there a more elegant solution?
[01:28:58] <gingitsune> ...
[01:29:04] <gingitsune> Briliant
[01:29:06] <gingitsune> thanks :D
[01:29:09] <lericson_> hehe ;)
[01:29:24] <lericson_> glad i could help
[01:29:31] <funnieguy> whatever element in form with a name will be in the request
[01:56:19] <gingitsune> Can anyone tell me why this only works on the rist two toggles?
[01:56:22] <gingitsune> first*
[01:56:23] <gingitsune> http://pastebin.com/cT2wQ3VX
[02:18:43] <funnieguy> gingitsune you may want to try console.log at function (idx, attr)
[02:18:53] <funnieguy> function (idx, attr){console.log(attr);}
[02:21:40] <funnieguy> gingitsune it appears "To retrieve and change DOM properties such as the checked, selected, or disabled state of form elements, use the .prop() method." https://api.jquery.com/attr/
[02:22:54] <gingitsune> Aww yeah, works like a charm.
[02:23:08] <gingitsune> Uppon disabling it was returning 'checked'
[02:23:09] <funnieguy> so prop?
[02:23:11] <kneekoo> what would be the best way to process 7 ajax queries in a row?
[02:23:13] <gingitsune> yep, prop
[02:23:40] <kneekoo> I tried a for loop but they all start at the same time and the data gets messed up
[02:23:54] <abhvym> i have a list of content of a directory. file are shown as file.ext and sub folders are shows as /full/path/to/sub/fulder. how can i detect it "/" present in a string and then only make it a link otherwise only show the file
[02:23:55] <abhvym> help
[02:23:57] <kneekoo> I tried async: false but then the browser freezes
[02:24:15] <funnieguy> should be async true?
[02:24:26] <kneekoo> async gets the data messed up
[02:24:49] <gingitsune> an interesting side effect. It auto toggles the select all checkbox aswell thus it stays allways turned off :)
[02:25:26] <funnieguy> abhvym javascript?
[02:25:30] <funnieguy> indexOf
[02:25:30] <abhvym> yes
[02:25:46] <abhvym> ok
[02:25:52] <funnieguy> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexof.asp
[02:26:26] <funnieguy> have you tried async true?
[02:28:15] <funnieguy> paste your code
[02:28:28] <kristofers> Hey, can't figure out why i get Type error undefined is not a function
[02:28:37] <kristofers> I have jquery loaded, and the code is put after jquery
[02:30:00] <funnieguy> if you click on the error in console it'll point you to the code
[02:30:06] <funnieguy> and paste the line here
[02:32:02] <kristofers> (function(f){jQuery.fn.extend({slimScroll:function(h){var a=f.extend({wid
[02:33:26] <funnieguy> are there alot of lines of code?
[02:33:30] <funnieguy> in the code you write
[02:33:36] <funnieguy> it's not because of jquery
[02:34:39] <funnieguy> note that it is $.get() and not $().get()
[02:34:48] <funnieguy> $.each() and not $().each()
[02:38:07] <Feel> Hello. I use jQuery UI draggable(). How I can do something on draggable() outside the draggable function? I want use like this: $([myCoolElement]).on('draggable', function() {[doSomething]});
[02:43:19] <funnieguy> kristofers did you solve the problem
[02:43:47] <funnieguy> Feel erm draggable doesn't work that way
[02:46:28] <funnieguy> $("#dragElement").draggable({

[02:47:33] <lericson_> please don't paste code here
[02:47:56] <kristofers> @funnieguy sry had to afk a bit
[02:48:34] <kristofers> I'm using an html template, and when putting all the js in the same order as the demo, it gives me this error
[02:51:22] <funnieguy> lericson sorry
[02:51:43] <funnieguy> jquery first
[02:51:47] <funnieguy> then plugins
[02:51:56] <funnieguy> dependencies above
[02:51:59] <funnieguy> your own code below
[02:52:21] <funnieguy> use $(document).ready(function(){whatever code;});
[02:52:30] <funnieguy> so that scripts are downloaded first
[03:01:48] <kristofers> bah this is making me go nuts
[03:03:01] <funnieguy> you mean you haven't written any code
[03:29:00] <JustMozzy> hi guys. I built a custom carousel and it works like a charme on most devices except for ipad ios 6 safari. there something weird is happening. http://paste2.org/tez4A5wE the li the dom change I am doing in the pasted code is executed with a massive delay which causes flickering and the animation to not run smoothly. does anyone have an idea how I could solve this issue?
[03:30:36] <funnieguy> your break
[03:30:40] <funnieguy> should have a semicolon
[03:30:41] <funnieguy> ;
[03:38:35] <JustMozzy> funnieguy: good eye, but that was not the problem
[03:40:23] <kev999> Hi all - is there a way to apply jquery to something dynamically added to the DOM - a bit like a reference variable - or do whatever when a div is added to the page?
[03:40:36] <kev999> i'll be very impressed if there is a way
[03:41:04] <funnieguy> kev999 yes as long as you can find identify the DOM
[03:41:19] <kev999> I can - how is it done?
[03:41:28] <funnieguy> JustMozzy, is your code in ready()?
[03:42:10] <JustMozzy> funnieguy: on a click event
[03:43:08] <funnieguy> JustMozzy,  is the .click or .on('click') in ready()
[03:43:38] <JustMozzy> funnieguy: yes
[03:43:45] <kev999> funnieguy - i wouldn't know when it would be added (due to timings) so how would I do this?
[03:47:23] <funnieguy> JustMozzy, does the problem occur when you click or when the page loads
[03:47:53] <funnieguy> kev999, quite simple to select the element(s) use $("selector")
[03:47:56] <funnieguy> like in css
[03:48:06] <funnieguy> so <img> tags
[03:48:13] <funnieguy> will be $("img")
[03:48:15] <JustMozzy> funnieguy: when I click. it is exactly in those lines in betwen the $ul.prepend/append and the animation. sometimes the dom is being changes while the animation is running.
[03:49:29] <funnieguy> and <img id="image1"> will be $("#image1") or $("img#image1")
[03:55:07] <funnieguy> JustMozzy, I can't exactly picture what you are trying to do
[04:01:07] <JustMozzy> funnieguy: nevermind. I'll just drop support for ios 6
[04:01:21] <funnieguy> lol so sorry
[04:01:37] <funnieguy> if it's browser prob
[04:02:00] <funnieguy> then hard
[04:02:04] <funnieguy> try isolate
[04:02:13] <funnieguy> like remove animation
[04:51:17] <joy4u> i am using wysiwyg editor (https://github.com/schnawel007/bootstrap3-wysihtml5) within form but the formatted text is created in the browser but not sent to the server on submit.
[04:58:56] <funnieguy> joy4u,
[04:58:58] <funnieguy> there?
[04:59:11] <funnieguy> put a name in the editor
[04:59:19] <funnieguy> <textarea name="">
[05:31:17] <skullcrasher> I got some trouble with connected sortables..
[05:32:00] <skullcrasher> in the first one there are some "previews" that can be dragged into the 2nd sortable. then not the cloned item should show up there
[05:32:09] <skullcrasher> but other content
[05:32:39] <skullcrasher> what do i have to change to show other content in there?
[05:33:02] <skullcrasher> i tried to replace the ui.item but then it's not on the right position
[05:33:27] <skullcrasher> any ideas?
[05:49:18] <kev999> funnieguy - sorry been at lunch - thanks for the reply earlier
[05:50:21] <brunoais> Surprise! I'm back (not that anybody cares about it...)
[05:51:05] <kev999> hey brunoais not me- but welcome back :-)
[05:51:30] <brunoais> who not you?
[05:51:38] <brunoais> (thanks)
[05:58:26] <disgrntld> hello, if I have a selector that matches multiple elements, I'd like to get the next element, but $(this).next() only selects adjacent siblings. I'd like the next element in the selector regardless of DOM hierarchy, any ideas?
[06:00:36] <decx> $(this).index() + 1
[06:02:45] <disgrntld> cool, thanks decx!
[06:05:11] <decx> well apparently index does rely on dom hirarchy and not selector position
[06:05:52] <brunoais> disgrntld, why won't you use it as an array and then re-encapsulate in jQuery?
[06:06:02] <brunoais> Or just use .eq()
[06:13:09] <disgrntld> this is what I'm using (forgive the attribute selector, I know I shouldn't be doing that): http://jsfiddle.net/4LLpg/  , to use it as an array I'd be looping over passwordList adding the handler, correct? Right now I'm setting them all to the same handler
[06:16:21] <bberry> is this how you would/should call other priveleged functions inside of an each statement? http://jsfiddle.net/fS8Sx/1/
[06:18:24] <brunoais> bberry, what do you mean with "previledged function"?
[06:19:54] <decx> disgrntld that won'T work because index resets to 0 in the new container
[06:20:36] <decx> but you can do index(this) on your main selector like here http://jsfiddle.net/rLdE9/
[06:20:57] <bberry> brunoais: a function that uses private variables, and therefore has to be declared inside the constructor fucntion
[06:21:12] <brunoais> Ah. Ok
[06:21:18] <bberry> (though i guess that one doesnt use any private vars, oops)
[06:21:24] <brunoais> (interestingly, that concept does not exist in js :D)
[06:21:45] <bberry> it does kinda though
[06:22:31] <disgrntld> I don't get it, decx.. mine seems to work fine (focus switches to next after maxlength is input)
[06:23:14] <decx> disgrntld compare with this: http://jsfiddle.net/rLdE9/1/
[06:23:21] <decx> works fine from 1-10 but then it breaks down
[06:24:34] <decx> you don't notice in because your only element outside of that main container is the button
[06:24:39] <decx> it*
[06:24:41] <disgrntld> ahhh. so my example only works because there's only one more element in the next container
[06:24:46] <decx> right
[06:24:48] <disgrntld> gotcha
[06:24:51] <disgrntld> okay, cool, thanks
[06:25:19] <decx> thank you, or else i'd have never known about selector.index(this) :D
[06:25:36] <disgrntld> haha, just doing what I can ;)
[06:29:44] <amcsi_work> hi
[06:30:06] <amcsi_work> how do I pass data to an ajax call's success and error callbacks?
[06:30:15] <amcsi_work> when making the ajax call
[06:35:10] <amcsi_work> I know I can pass one object to be available as "this" with the help of the context property
[06:37:54] <amcsi_work> or should I just add custom properties to the jqXHR object returned by $.ajax() and then access it from the success and error callbacks because they receive the same object as a parameter?
[06:37:58] <BillCriswell> amcsi_work: This came to mind for me: .done(function(data){ handleExtraStuff(data, foo, bar); });
[06:39:29] <amcsi_work> BillCriswell, ok, now imagine the done handler is not defined inline and somewhere else, but foo and bar are defined where I make the ajax call
[06:40:01] <amcsi_work> how would I make foo and bar available to the method that is predefined elsewhere?
[06:48:19] <bberry> brunoais: This is about as close as you get to a 'private' variable
[06:49:01] <brunoais> bberry, true :). It's an emulation
[07:00:21] <skullcrasher> how do i get the index of a sortable item, if it was just dropped into the list?
[07:00:37] <skullcrasher> the index of ui.item is always 0 and ui.placeholder -1
[07:01:38] <brunoais> skullcrasher, Which one? a NodeList or an array?
[07:02:42] <skullcrasher> err i guess a NodeList
[07:02:59] <skullcrasher> i put a draggable into the sortable and want to get it's index
[07:03:11] <skullcrasher> for the new item
[07:03:14] <brunoais> skullcrasher, wow... wait
[07:03:20] <brunoais> I didn't quite get that
[07:03:23] <skullcrasher> :D
[07:03:26] <brunoais> give me some code pls
[07:06:40] <joesmith> does anyone know if a form submit button should have type=submit or type=button when it doesn't load a URL but instead runs a javascript function?
[07:07:44] <joesmith> the reason i ask is because if type is not submit, jquery :submit selector doesnt work
[07:10:17] <brunoais> joesmith, type=submit
[07:10:38] <brunoais> joesmith, and don't go by that idea
[07:10:56] <joesmith> brunoais: not sure which you are suggesting?
[07:11:05] <joesmith> youre saying use type-submit always?
[07:11:50] <brunoais> joesmith, I'm saying: Use the type that corresponds to what you actually mean it to correspond semantically and avoid using jQuery specific selectors, when possible (like this case).
[07:13:55] <skullcrasher> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/GLs29/
[07:14:04] <skullcrasher> draggin from right to left is possible
[07:14:22] <joesmith> brunoais: well it is a submit button, so i think it should be type=submit. but some documentation seems to say only use that of the form has a URL to load as the action
[07:14:44] <joesmith> and i thought the :submit selector was what should be used to find a form's submit button
[07:14:47] <brunoais> joesmith, it's a form, right?
[07:15:01] <joesmith> brunoais: right, it's a form
[07:15:01] <brunoais> joesmith, that's jQuery's specific selector
[07:15:07] <b1lly> Any thoughts on the structure/design? https://github.com/b1lly/gumi
[07:15:18] <brunoais> jorge_lo, then it's type=submit
[07:15:26] <brunoais> because you are submitting the form itself
[07:15:37] <jorge_lo> joesmith: Think that was for you :)
[07:15:38] <brunoais> joesmith, why can't the user also submit it without js?
[07:15:55] <brunoais> jorge_lo, ups, sorry
[07:17:17] <brunoais> skullcrasher, I need to see your question again. can you repeat it for me?
[07:17:22] <skullcrasher> sure
[07:17:33] <skullcrasher> if i drag an item from the right side to left list
[07:17:46] <skullcrasher> i want the index of this new item in the list
[07:18:00] <joesmith> brunoais: not sure what you're asking when you say why can't they submit it without JS, i'm simply trying to find the element and wondering if this page is semantically incorrect
[07:18:07] <brunoais> skullcrasher, so... you want it to update the number that appears? Is that it?
[07:18:22] <skullcrasher> no no, this are just example entries
[07:18:37] <brunoais> joesmith, if you show me the URL I can help you with that
[07:18:53] <brunoais> skullcrasher, then I'm failing to understand the question :(
[07:19:14] <skullcrasher> brunoais: it's that in the beginning there are 5 items in the sortable list on the left
[07:19:26] <skullcrasher> now i add an (cloned) item from the right
[07:19:31] <skullcrasher> so 6 items in the list now
[07:19:39] <joesmith> brunoais: i can paste the form html, is that what you want to see?
[07:19:57] <skullcrasher> I try to get the index of the new added item
[07:20:05] <brunoais> joesmith, that's an option. In jsfiddle, for exaomple
[07:20:19] <brunoais> skullcrasher, index in the divs?
[07:20:25] <skullcrasher> yes, in the list
[07:20:30] <brunoais> (it should have been a list, though)
[07:20:31] <skullcrasher> so i can replace it with another element
[07:20:34] <decx> is it national index day? what's with all the index questions today
[07:20:49] <brunoais> decx, beats me. But it's interesting
[07:20:57] <decx> international even ^^
[07:21:11] <skullcrasher> ^^
[07:21:17] <brunoais> skullcrasher, so... You want to allow the items on the right to replace items on the lef,t right?
[07:21:19] <skullcrasher> sry decx :P
[07:21:27] <brunoais> ... as the user drags them
[07:22:13] <Guest64453> Hi, I am using Jquery to clone a row.  When a column is empty, it shows it like so <td />.  I need it to be <td ></>.  The latter displays "Text - empty text node".  I need the latter for sorting purposes.  W/o it, the rows do not sort properly.  Any ideas?
[07:22:16] <skullcrasher> it adds the items on the right (additional) and after successfully adding it, it should be replaced by another dom element
[07:22:51] <brunoais> Guest37246, why not place an empty text node inside when it was empty?
[07:22:55] <joesmith> brunoais: not much here, but heres what the buttons look like - http://jsfiddle.net/E2EWn/ . the submit button has a jqeury listener on it
[07:22:55] <skullcrasher> for now I would be fine to get the index of the added item from the new list :)
[07:23:17] <Guest64453> brunoais, how can I do that?
[07:23:36] <Guest64453> ive tried empty string no width, but I get "null" when it is displayed
[07:23:52] <brunoais> skullcrasher, the UI you present is nothing about replacing. What it seems to be showing is adding something from the right to the left. You seriously should find something that tells the user something as "I'm replacing that with this thing"
[07:23:57] <brunoais> try starting from there
[07:24:14] <skullcrasher> well, as i said. replacing not neccessary for now
[07:24:24] <brunoais> The interface may also be different or have different callback available
[07:24:29] <skullcrasher> I'm happy if I can figure out how to get the index of the added item
[07:24:44] <brunoais> skullcrasher, Hum... you have the HTML node, right
[07:24:54] <skullcrasher> the source one
[07:25:08] <brunoais> skullcrasher, the one you received to add
[07:25:11] <skullcrasher> it seems that in "receive" the ui.item is the source node
[07:25:21] <BillCriswell>  You can pass an element to .is()... Just learned that, nice.
[07:25:50] <skullcrasher> so by calling ui.item.index() i get the index of the item in the old list (right side)
[07:27:01] <skullcrasher> brunoais: so let's say you drag the 3rd item on the right to the 5th position on the left. I try to get the index (that should return 4 as the list starts at 0)
[07:27:20] <skullcrasher> but it returns 2 (position of right list)
[07:27:23] <brunoais> skullcrasher, $('#sortable') <- that returns the pointer to the element that contains the divs
[07:27:30] <brunoais> why not use that?
[07:27:46] <brunoais> Guest37246, pls wait... these 2 are fulling me :D
[07:27:54] <skullcrasher> sry :/
[07:28:03] <brunoais> what?
[07:28:07] <brunoais> It's fun ^^
[07:28:23] <Guest64453> brunoais, take your time.. Im googling..but everything empty leaves "null".  I will wait
[07:28:33] <brunoais> skullcrasher, cache the pointer to that element
[07:28:46] <brunoais> then use the index()
[07:28:59] <skullcrasher> oO
[07:29:06] <brunoais> maybe you are using the .index() before the element is placed in the list
[07:29:29] <NoiseEee> Guest64453: if you want a proper 'empty' td, the content isnt an empty string, its &nbsp;
[07:29:50] <brunoais> skullcrasher, It's been quite a while since I used jQuery's drag&drop
[07:29:59] <skullcrasher> :)
[07:30:04] <brunoais> I'm ATM I'm more using the DOM's drag&drop
[07:30:09] <Guest64453> NoisEee, I tried that, html displays it as "null"
[07:30:18] <brunoais> *ATM I'm more using the DOM's drag&drop
[07:30:37] <brunoais> not that it is a good api, as I wanted, though <_<
[07:30:41] <skullcrasher> the strange thing for me is that the sortable's receive ui.item is the source node, and not the one in the list
[07:30:56] <brunoais> skullcrasher, try using setTimeout()
[07:30:59] <skullcrasher> but ok, I'll try to cache this somehow and then index
[07:31:17] <brunoais> skullcrasher, caching the variable is just storing in a pointer
[07:31:22] <skullcrasher> just can't figure this out of the documentation
[07:31:44] <skullcrasher> hard work :9
[07:31:46] <brunoais> skullcrasher, try using setTimeout(), if it works, then it means that that callback is called before
[07:31:52] <skullcrasher> ok
[07:32:16] <brunoais> Guest37246, what have you tried? can you show me on a jsfiddle?
[07:32:32] <joesmith> brunoais: just making sure you saw my paste - http://jsfiddle.net/E2EWn/k.
[07:33:03] <Guest64453> okay ill try on jsfiddle
[07:34:30] <brunoais> joesmith, eh... that doesn't really help much... I say its type should be submit
[07:34:39] <brunoais> and you need a form@action
[07:35:43] <joesmith> brunoais: ok, im trying to actually fix this existing stuff, it does work with the button listener so thats probably why they didnt have an action
[07:35:59] <brunoais> joesmith, wait what?
[07:36:05] <brunoais> button listener?
[07:36:14] <brunoais> what's that?
[07:36:14] <joesmith> 1 sec ill show you
[07:37:28] <Kartapux> Hi veryone
[07:37:41] <skullcrasher> brunoais: ok got it :D
[07:37:55] <skullcrasher> just use update instead of receive ...
[07:37:58] <brunoais> skullcrasher, did it work?
[07:38:01] <brunoais> Ok
[07:38:09] <brunoais> you were using the wrong callback
[07:38:11] <skullcrasher> http://jsfiddle.net/GLs29/1/
[07:38:14] <skullcrasher> seems like
[07:38:16] <brunoais> (I do prefer using events, though)
[07:38:26] <joesmith> brunoais: $('#formSubmit').on('click', saveConfig);
[07:38:26] <skullcrasher> in console the right ids are showing up
[07:38:33] <Guest64453> brunoais, thanks for your help.  I figured it out. turns out if I use .html(), I get no closing tag if its empty. But if I use innerHTML=  then, I get the closing tag if its empty.
[07:38:59] <brunoais> Guest37246, do you need that?
[07:39:16] <brunoais> are you sure you cannot just work with the DOM API, instead (even if through jQuery)
[07:39:33] <Guest64453> i need the closing tag, because this third party sorting utility won't sort properly if there is not closing tag
[07:39:37] <brunoais> innerHTML has many gotchas that the DOM api doesn't
[07:40:26] <Guest64453> if there is a way to put add clsoing tag to .html(), then I'd def use it
[07:40:40] <brunoais> naw, don't use .html() when possible
[07:40:52] <joesmith> brunoais: i should've said click event handler, not button listener
[07:40:52] <brunoais> Use the Nodes
[07:41:02] <brunoais> joesmith, oh, ok
[07:42:08] <joesmith> brunoais: so does that mean it's ok not to have the form have an action, and i can still change the type=submit?
[07:42:13] <brunoais> Guest37246, most probably you'll get less issues if you act on the DOM API without the use of stuff like innerHTML
[07:42:26] <brunoais> you may get the same but you'll definitely won't get less
[07:42:29] <joesmith> (i realize this isnt really jquery specific, but i appreciate your thoughts)
[07:42:39] <brunoais> joesmith, what?
[07:42:53] <brunoais> Oh
[07:43:28] <brunoais> joesmith, a form without an action, for a browser, means to submit to the same page. For the spec means invalid
[07:43:45] <brunoais> (I have to reopen that bug...)
[07:43:55] <brunoais> anyway
[07:44:17] <brunoais> There's nearly no reason to have a form submitted using AJAX and not allow it to submit without it
[07:44:26] <brunoais> that way you have a fail-safe if js fails
[07:44:31] <Kartapux> I'm writing an HTML form were each field belongs to a class. Events for each class triggers some functions declared in the heading. My problem comes from the fact that some of the form fields are generated and created live with PHP / Ajax . Then those fields seem not to trigger the functions associated with their class. Do you have a clue? Am I clear?
[07:45:12] <brunoais> Kartapux, what is a class in your system? In which languages are those "class"es?
[07:46:28] <Kartapux> brunoais: They are javascript / jquery class
[07:46:40] <joesmith> brunoais: i dont think im gonna win the battle changing these forms from ajax, but hopefully i can at least get the button type changed
[07:46:44] <brunoais> Kartapux, can't be. javascript has no class concept
[07:46:54] <brunoais> there's no such thing as classes in javascript
[07:47:03] <brunoais> Kartapux, what is it, more exactly?
[07:47:23] <NCS_One> hi
[07:47:47] <NCS_One> anyone using:https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js   can confirm that event "cursorchanged" works ok
[07:48:29] <brunoais> NCS_One, any example I can test on?
[07:48:45] <brunoais> Kartapux, was it you who made it?
[07:49:04] <Kartapux> brunoais: Hummm... sorry I'm beeing so newbee. Each field has a class attribute in the HTML form. Then I have a jquery event like $(".theClass").click(...)
[07:49:48] <brunoais> Kartapux, seriously? TBH, if I understood right, you don't know what you are doing.
[07:50:07] <brunoais> you seem to be doing a code maintenance hell
[07:51:04] <Kartapux> brunoais: Hummm. I thought I did... What's wrong with what I'm saying?
[07:51:29] <rcr> is there a way to trigger an event when the open/save file download dialog is opened?
[07:51:58] <brunoais> rcr, no. Don't trust that. js is locked on some browsers when that happens
[07:52:27] <brunoais> Kartapux, Too many events on the input nodes that may or may not do what they are supposed to do
[07:52:45] <rcr> hmm, some documents take a while to generate in the backend and im trying to add a 'please wait' overlay, so i want to hide it when the file is ready
[07:52:46] <brunoais> Kartapux, what do you actually want with so many click events?
[07:53:16] <brunoais> rcr, the file picker only opens when user action is required to select a file
[07:53:26] <brunoais> (or a download location)
[07:54:00] <NCS_One> brunoais: wait
[07:54:24] <brunoais> rcr, besides... the user has to wait for the file to be ready in the backend, right? Only after that, the file picker opens asking where to save the file
[07:55:08] <rcr> brunoais: yes exactly. I just want to close the 'please wait' overlay when the file is ready, so im trying to capture that event somehow
[07:55:34] <brunoais> rcr, in that case, when the file is ready, before the file picker opens, you remove the "please wait"
[07:55:36] <brunoais> simple as that
[07:56:21] <brunoais> rcr, the file picker only opens when the file is given to the user to download
[07:56:41] <brunoais> so you just remove it when the server says the OK and you redirect the user to where he can download the file
[07:58:53] <rcr> ahh.. i see. right now im just doing a very simple form submit
[08:00:34] <Kartapux> brunoais: Ok. Well one use that i'm targeting is a calendar where users can book a day. A php / mysql / ajax script generates the calendar considering all the days that the user already booked. For each day there a checkbox to click in order to book. It the checkbox is checked then I want an ajax function to save or update the database.
[08:02:06] <Kartapux> brunoais: Ok, for this example, I don't need a class. I could do it with IDs. But I belive it doesn't work either
[08:04:03] <brunoais> Kartapux, use data-* attributes to store data and place an .on() on the containing element of the calendar items selection
[08:05:39] <Kartapux> brunoais: Ok. I'll have a look. Thank you
[08:06:00] <brunoais> Kartapux, you're welcome :)
[08:06:09] <brunoais> I think that was the list...
[08:06:10] <brunoais> uff
[08:06:18] <brunoais> It was fun
[08:25:34] <Kartapux> Ok I have a new question (mostly for curiosity). I declared a function test() inside the $(document).ready. It seems to me that this function is not triggered when I use onClick("test()") in the body. Am I missing something?
[08:26:30] <brunoais> Kartapux, what is onClick? Where did you define that function?
[08:30:31] <Kartapux> brunoais: It the javascript event. Sorry I ment onClick="test()" instead of onClick("test()"). Like <input type=checkbox onClick='test()'>
[08:30:54] <brunoais> Kartapux, it's onclick and DO NOT USE IT
[08:31:05] <BillCriswell> I need a nap.
[08:31:08] <brunoais> it is one of the main js maintainability hell
[08:31:26] <brunoais> I MEAN IT!
[08:31:44] <brunoais> I already have to work on programs that use it
[08:31:54] <brunoais> it's hell when something goes wrong
[08:32:21] <Kartapux> humm, ok
[08:34:58] <decx> yeah, inline is poison. but if you add about a million ng- attributes instead it somehow becomes *modern* again
[08:35:01] <NoiseEee> Kartapux: you should not be using inline javascript.
[08:35:43] <brunoais> decx, what's ng- attributes?
[08:35:57] <decx> angular
[08:36:09] <brunoais> I still vomit that thing
[08:36:15] <PenguinMan98> I set up a jquery get.  When the page is loaded, the request fires but fails to resolve.  If I use my console to copy the get string out of the request and put that string into the browser URL bar, it gives the correct result.  Ideas?
[08:36:26] <BillCriswell> decx: Have you been siding with any particular javascript framework?
[08:36:39] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, What fails to resolve?
[08:36:44] <PenguinMan98> $.get()
[08:36:55] <decx> no
[08:37:14] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, are you sure you are using it corrcetly?
[08:37:46] <BillCriswell> decx: That's probably the smart thing to do lol
[08:37:51] <Kartapux> Ok. I thank your for your piece of advice on inline javascript. But it seemed pretty convenient when the body is automatically generated with PHP as I can't forcast what it would be
[08:37:52] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, what's the url you are using? what's the effective it is trying to resolve? (just to make sure it is correct)
[08:38:05] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, is it in the same domain as the web page?
[08:38:13] <PenguinMan98> it is not
[08:38:20] <PenguinMan98> in the same domain
[08:38:27] <brunoais> Kartapux, yeah... that's why it is poison
[08:38:33] <PenguinMan98> http://screencast.com/t/mMPWWKxymR77
[08:39:47] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, what does the console show?
[08:41:12] <PenguinMan98> http://screencast.com/t/9h4ZEv7qm3
[08:43:13] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, they are not the same domain... But I don't remember if you need CORS or not there...
[08:43:23] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, what's the error in the js console?
[08:43:29] * PenguinMan98 has no idea what CORS is.
[08:43:33] <PenguinMan98> No error is given
[08:43:43] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, firefox?
[08:43:47] <PenguinMan98> yes
[08:43:56] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, use the browser's console instead
[08:43:59] <brunoais> try again
[08:44:14] <brunoais> check for both warnings and errors, not just warnings
[08:44:25] <brunoais> *not just errors
[08:45:54] <NCS_One> brunoais: "cursorchanged" only works for key down not for mouse pointer
[08:47:15] <brunoais> NCS_One, I never used that event, so I dunno :S
[08:47:24] <PenguinMan98> It shows a status 200 on the request
[08:47:32] <PenguinMan98> but the console.log didn't fire
[08:47:40] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, no way
[08:47:41] <PenguinMan98> still no errors or warnings
[08:47:56] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, show me what appears in the browser's console please
[08:48:11] <brunoais> I need to know if it is sending the CORS headers or not
[08:48:21] <PenguinMan98> http://screencast.com/t/Kh3jqcx8
[08:49:21] <brunoais> PenguinMan98, I'm missing something...
[08:49:41] <PenguinMan98> Yeah tell me about it
[08:49:50] <brunoais> I can't really get what... I just feel like I need more info
[08:49:58] <brunoais> but I dunno what I need to know what to tell you
[08:49:59] <PenguinMan98> I don't come in here often but when I do, it's usually a doozy
[08:50:06] <brunoais> I don't use .get() much
[08:50:26] <brunoais> (better make it: I don't use .get())
[08:50:38] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax() crew unite!
[08:50:43] <brunoais> \o/
[08:50:59] <brunoais> and I only use .ajax() due to IE <_<
[08:51:00] <PenguinMan98> Yep. Lemme rewrite it as $.ajax and see if that helps
[08:51:03] <brunoais> (yes you there!)
[08:51:08] <brunoais> maybe...
[08:51:25] <brunoais> I use XMLHttpRequest much more often, though...
[08:52:47] <brunoais> Oh thamn! I have to leave in 5 mins :S
[09:08:26] <Katharsis> $("select").change is working for select objects which are create before of using this method?
[09:08:38] <duch_kazatel> Katharsis huh?
[09:08:41] <duch_kazatel> you mean it isn't working?
[09:08:47] <Katharsis> yes
[09:08:52] <duch_kazatel> that sounds about right.
[09:09:02] <duch_kazatel> you need to use event delegation, which would be through .on()
[09:09:17] <duch_kazatel> what element are you appending these to?
[09:09:48] <Katharsis> ok, I full describe my example
[09:10:01] <duch_kazatel> i just need to know the container you're appending to.
[09:10:05] <yonghan> hi all
[09:10:15] <duch_kazatel> because you can do $('parent').on('change', 'select', function(){});
[09:10:28] <Katharsis> term_crp.js generate HTML form (with select-options objects)
[09:10:31] <duch_kazatel> where 'parent' is the parent element that exists on pageload.
[09:10:46] <Katharsis> next file, cases.js is working on it - parse values and counting it
[09:11:08] <Katharsis> cases.js has $("select").change which is working with static HTML select
[09:11:10] <duch_kazatel> Katharsis  - i just gave you exactly the code you need to use instead of .change()
[09:11:17] <Katharsis> but not with these which are generated by jQuery
[09:11:17] <yonghan> i would like to ask if anyone know what plugin does this website use for the slider?it shows next image on hover. http://www.ajbakery.com/ thanks
[09:11:46] <duch_kazatel> yonghan you mean carousel?
[09:12:16] <yonghan> yes,is it carousel or slideshow?
[09:12:21] <duch_kazatel> that's a carousel.
[09:12:32] <duch_kazatel> and it looks like a modified version of bxSlider.
[09:12:46] <duch_kazatel> i'm also seeing the page reference "slidorion"
[09:13:01] <Katharsis> duch_kazatel: thx, it works
[09:13:55] <HardFu> I have a fieldset which has a checkbox and an input field with an integer inside
[09:13:56] <proycon> quick silly question, if I register a handler $(x).click(y) and then $(x).click(z) it will replace the original handler and not stack right (so in this case, z and not y)?
[09:14:16] <HardFu> what's the best way to always double that number if checkbox is unchecked and vice versa?
[09:14:35] <duch_kazatel> proycon .click() (and .on()) add event handlers.
[09:14:37] <duch_kazatel> never replace.
[09:14:43] <duch_kazatel> HardFu hrm?
[09:14:56] <duch_kazatel> HardFu you want to multiply an input value by 2?
[09:14:59] <puchacz> hi, I have a header that stays atop when I scroll page down: position:fixed; z-index:99; top: 50px;  it interferes with anchor navigation - link with href="#whatever" makes <a name="whatever"> appear at the top, so below my header. how do I solve it please?
[09:15:07] <proycon> hmm.. so it end up calling double... that explains my bug :) thanks
[09:15:08] <HardFu> duch_kazatel
[09:15:10] <HardFu> yes
[09:15:20] <HardFu> and the whole fieldset can be added programatically
[09:15:25] <duch_kazatel> puchacz you need to offset the amount you scroll.
[09:15:29] <duch_kazatel> HardFu huh?
[09:15:43] <duch_kazatel> HardFu your question is strange - could you fiddle up something like what you mean?
[09:16:02] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: what do you mean? jump from href="#anchor" to name="anchor" is happening automatically
[09:16:06] <HardFu> duch_kazatel: http://cl.ly/image/350h1D3J0s3U
[09:16:10] <HardFu> I hope image will do
[09:16:15] <yonghan> @duch_kazatel do yo mean it's fully modified?
[09:16:20] <yonghan> *you
[09:16:27] <duch_kazatel> HardFu that doesn't help.  i need a fiddle please.
[09:16:38] <HardFu> ok
[09:16:41] <duch_kazatel> puchacz you have to rewrite that functionality to scroll to a vertical offset.
[09:16:45] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: I have this as well: $("body").css("padding-top", ($("#learning-toolbar").height() + 55) + "px");
[09:17:08] <duch_kazatel> puchacz that's not going to help.
[09:17:09] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: so I move the whole body already
[09:17:21] <duch_kazatel> yonghan it looks like that preview on hover of the right/left arrows is custom.
[09:17:40] <duch_kazatel> yonghan inspect the page and figure out how they did it :) shouldnt be too hard.
[09:18:22] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: is there an example for what you are suggesting? or a plugin?
[09:18:34] <stlstude> I'm trying to replace dynamic content from one table cell into another and having some trouble. Can someone explain why my thinking here doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/9muWn/
[09:19:09] <yonghan> @duch_kazatel does firebug is enough for inspecting the page or are there other firefox or chrome plugin which are more complete?
[09:19:35] <duch_kazatel> puchacz not really... it's pretty trivial.  use scrollTop()
[09:19:37] <duch_kazatel> 7) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:19:37] <duch_kazatel> [2014:05:02:09:17:40] <duch_kazatel> yonghan inspect the pa
[09:19:39] <duch_kazatel> woops
[09:19:52] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/ - puchacz <-- read this.
[09:19:59] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: thanks, I will check it :-)
[09:20:07] <duch_kazatel> puchacz also, https://api.jquery.com/offset/ this.
[09:20:24] <HardFu> duch_kazatel found the solution, thanks anyway :)
[09:20:27] <duch_kazatel> yonghan firebug / chrome dev tools / firefox's built in tools are very complete.  they have their strengths and weaknesses.
[09:20:28] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: thx
[09:20:39] <duch_kazatel> HardFu glad to hear :)
[09:20:59] <duch_kazatel> HardFu still interested to know what the problem was.
[09:21:29] <yonghan> @duch_kazatel thanks,i'll try to figure it out. :)
[09:21:50] <HardFu> duch_kazatel: I didn't know how to organize checkbox click listener for dynamically added checkboxes
[09:22:17] <duch_kazatel> yonghan btw - when referencing people in IRC, it's better to just use their screenname, instead of prepending/appending anything on it.  most people's clients will notify them when they're mentioned.
[09:22:22] <duch_kazatel> HardFu use event delegation for that.
[09:22:27] <duch_kazatel> don't dynamically add event handlers.
[09:22:48] <HardFu> as in, listen on the form?
[09:23:03] <duch_kazatel> HardFu on whatever static parent exists on pageload, yes - $(
[09:23:05] <duch_kazatel> err.
[09:23:09] <yonghan> duch_kazatel Sorry about it and thanks for the information
[09:23:22] <duch_kazatel> $('form').on('change', 'input', function(){ /* handler here */ });
[09:27:48] <decx> man this is the dead horse if #jquery questions, so i'm going to use a dead horse medium for it http://i.imgur.com/R4udIGc.png
[09:28:04] <duch_kazatel> yaaaaay
[09:28:10] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[09:32:31] <Mr_Grim> in jquery how can I add a click event to all elements with a data attribute data-cid ? data-cid="value" is inside a list of href tags
[09:32:57] <duch_kazatel> Mr_Grim is it at all possible for you to add a class to those elements instead?>
[09:33:23] <Mr_Grim> duch_kazatel i could but should I not be using data- attribute now? isn't that the HTML5 way?
[09:33:34] <duch_kazatel> data attributes are for storing data.
[09:33:37] <duch_kazatel> selecting on them is slow.
[09:33:37] <Mr_Grim> well yeah
[09:33:43] <Mr_Grim> ahh
[09:33:44] <Mr_Grim> okay
[09:33:45] <Mr_Grim> i see
[09:33:49] <duch_kazatel> IDs and Classes are much more performant for selecting.
[09:33:59] <Mr_Grim> ill stick with that
[09:34:00] <Mr_Grim> thanks
[09:34:00] <duch_kazatel> you CAN do $('[data-cid="value"]').on('click', function(){});, but attribute selectors are slow.
[09:34:15] <Mr_Grim> i did not know that
[09:36:41] <bberry> http://mashable.com/2014/04/30/programming-sucks/?utm_cid=mash-com-Tw-main-link
[09:36:46] <bberry> quite entertaining
[09:37:17] <decx> class lookup is about 100% faster
[09:37:20] <duch_kazatel> i read that the other day.  it was almost scary how accurate some of it was.
[09:37:30] <Mr_Grim> i am writing a hardcore web dev example for a job interview, anyone care to take a look?
[09:37:44] <duch_kazatel> Mr_Grim lol sure.
[09:37:46] <duch_kazatel> "hardcore web dev"
[09:37:49] <bberry> lol
[09:37:50] <Mr_Grim> it's PHP / MySQL with some serious front end
[09:38:06] <Mr_Grim> https://github.com/ronaldwerd/SampleWebArchitecturePHP
[09:38:07] <duch_kazatel> if you want to be hardcore, don't use PHP / MySQL.
[09:38:13] <Mr_Grim> yeah i know
[09:38:17] <Mr_Grim> i should be using rails or something
[09:38:21] <duch_kazatel> hell no.
[09:38:27] <bberry> >.<
[09:38:30] <Mr_Grim> JEE?
[09:38:34] <duch_kazatel> rails is oldscool.
[09:38:38] <duch_kazatel> at this point.
[09:38:43] <Mr_Grim> everyone is on node.js now?
[09:38:43] <duch_kazatel> use node or something crazy.
[09:39:01] <duch_kazatel> yeah node's the new pretty thing on the block.
[09:39:16] <duch_kazatel> where's this "serious front end"?
[09:39:19] <nhulea> yeah I like it alot
[09:39:27] <Mr_Grim> its a small sample
[09:39:34] <Mr_Grim> i decided to use backbone and jquery
[09:39:38] <bberry> never worked with either of these, but java and python seem to be relatively accepted as well
[09:39:42] <Mr_Grim> angular might be overkill for the demo
[09:39:44] <duch_kazatel> underscore templates.
[09:39:54] <nhulea> yeah undescore is pretty good
[09:40:01] <duch_kazatel> angular might be overkill, but you're using backbone?
[09:40:17] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: right on
[09:40:18] <Mr_Grim> duch_kazatel the client want's to see how I would create a large website project from scratch
[09:40:28] <Mr_Grim> and they are looking for clean code and proper code organization
[09:40:33] <Mr_Grim> so this is what I came up with
[09:40:42] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[09:40:55] <Mr_Grim> duch_kazatel would you hire me? lol
[09:41:04] <nhulea> there is also derby
[09:41:06] <duch_kazatel> we don't use PHP here.
[09:41:17] <Mr_Grim> if you did use PHP
[09:41:20] <Mr_Grim> cause the client is using that
[09:41:34] <Mr_Grim> i created my own crud library using reflection
[09:41:36] <duch_kazatel> we need people very comfortable with the thought of dropping into a middleware layer that is fucking terrible.
[09:41:45] <Mr_Grim> ohhh i have something then lool
[09:41:56] <duch_kazatel> our application is batty.
[09:42:04] <Mr_Grim> duch_kazatel: https://github.com/ronaldwerd/ecc_services
[09:42:12] <Mr_Grim> Rest web services in JEE
[09:42:17] <Mr_Grim> code is Mr Clean clean!
[09:42:23] <Mr_Grim> works with JBoss AS 7.1
[09:42:24] <duch_kazatel> try coldfusion ;)
[09:42:39] <nhulea> holy shit !
[09:42:48] <duch_kazatel> ?
[09:42:48] <Mr_Grim> notice that i dont use setters and getters
[09:43:09] <nhulea> isnt coldfusion that shit from adobe
[09:43:11] <Mr_Grim> i guess the next level would be using grails
[09:43:17] <duch_kazatel> nhulea yep.  still alive and kicking.
[09:43:24] <bberry> wowee.
[09:43:26] <nhulea> really ?
[09:43:29] <duch_kazatel> oh yeah.
[09:43:32] <duch_kazatel> CF10 came out recently.
[09:43:38] <Mr_Grim> duch_kazatel: i hope the client likes my demo, i worked pretty hard on it
[09:43:41] <bberry> ./wrists
[09:43:47] <nhulea> whoa I am downloading this right now
[09:43:55] <duch_kazatel> as a templating system, it's so-so.  as anything beyond that, it's a fucking nightmare.
[09:44:09] <duch_kazatel> but it's all written in java now, so it could be a LOT worse.
[09:44:16] <duch_kazatel> and cfscript is getting better all the time.
[09:44:37] <nhulea> yeah I remeber years ago messing with it
[09:44:50] <bberry> duch_kazatel have you played much with node.js and express.js?
[09:45:06] <duch_kazatel> bberry a bit.  we have a team building our tablet site using them.
[09:45:08] <nhulea> bberry: I have some ecperience with it
[09:45:15] <bberry> do yall use jade?
[09:45:23] <duch_kazatel> dust
[09:45:32] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:45:50] <bberry> im about to start converting my site from client side to server side, and cant decide how i want to do it
[09:45:56] <Mr_Grim> the web dev world is chaotic right now, so much stuff to choose out there
[09:46:01] <bberry> yep
[09:46:03] <duch_kazatel> Mr_Grim it's great :)
[09:46:09] <duch_kazatel> lots of tools to pick from.
[09:46:16] <bberry> Mr_Grim did you see the article i posted earlier? I feel like it is appropriate right about now... :P
[09:46:27] <Mr_Grim> bberry no
[09:46:31] <bberry> http://mashable.com/2014/04/30/programming-sucks/?utm_cid=mash-com-Tw-main-link
[09:46:32] <Mr_Grim> what's the link?
[09:46:52] <Mr_Grim> PHPStorm
[09:46:53] <Mr_Grim> nice
[09:46:55] <Mr_Grim> i use that now
[09:47:19] <Mr_Grim> I may get a consulting job soon and go back to school and do an EMBA
[09:47:26] <bberry> is that the IDE hes using or something?
[09:47:35] <Mr_Grim> a major bank might be hiring me for mobile strategy
[09:47:40] <Mr_Grim> and this is a good way to get out of coding for a bit
[09:47:48] <Mr_Grim> coding is a grind man
[09:47:52] <bberry> 'tis
[09:47:55] <nhulea> I like that ejs and handlebars
[09:48:10] <bberry> this is why i am a computer engineer and not a computer science guy
[09:48:14] <bberry> when i get sick of coding
[09:48:16] <bberry> i just go do hardware
[09:48:29] <Mr_Grim> i did a year of management consulting
[09:48:30] <bberry> (which, lets be honest, can be just as bad)
[09:48:32] <Mr_Grim> i like working with people
[09:48:37] <Mr_Grim> and going to meetings
[09:49:23] <d0de> http://jsfiddle.net/u5pR5/ I want to adjust the image opacity based on the slider value to the nearest multiple of ten. This fiddle works when the input is slid, but not when the input is clicked. How can I fix it?
[09:49:24] <Mr_Grim> im 34 now, ill suck it up until im 38, get my EMBA with 4 years consulting experience and hopefully a promotion and try be a partner in some consulting firm
[09:49:35] <Mr_Grim> buy a boat, and take 2 months off a year
[09:49:49] <bberry> haha did you say that when your were 25 too?
[09:50:01] <d0de> As in, if the value of the slider is 1.0 and the user clicks it to 0.12, it doesn't go through the any multiples of ten on the way, so the method I'm using at the moment doesn't work
[09:50:02] <Mr_Grim> bberry nooo
[09:50:10] <Mr_Grim> when I was 25 i had my head up my ass
[09:51:04] <d0de> I can't just adjust the step of the slider, because I'm using the same slider for other stuff that needs more granularity
[09:53:16] <Mr_Grim> bberry do you work for yourself or manage a large team somewhere?
[09:53:27] <Mr_Grim> bberry your article leads me to believe you have social skills lol
[09:56:18] <bberry> Mr_Grim haha, neither. I, myself, am a 25 y/o kid 2 years into a computer eng job that somehow turned into web development for a microcontroller that uses GSM to connect to the interwebs.
[09:57:16] <bberry> Mr_Grim i like to think that i have social skills enough to get by if i ever got moved up the chain though, XD
[09:57:51] <nhulea> at least your heads not up your ass
[09:58:23] <bberry> now, i dont know about that
[09:59:13] <bberry> :P i just hope its not and let others decide for me
[09:59:20] <nhulea> I am in the same "boat" as Mr_Grim haha
[10:03:46] <PenguinMan98> I changed the $.get() to $.ajax().  It still fails
[10:03:57] <PenguinMan98> And I'm now completely bewildered
[10:04:42] <PenguinMan98> The ajax call to the data fails to resolve
[10:04:56] <PenguinMan98> But if I take the URL it's calling to and put it into the browser, it gives the correct result
[10:05:06] <PenguinMan98> wtf
[10:05:15] <NoiseEee> same origin policy is obeyed, PenguinMan98?
[10:05:23] <PenguinMan98> It's cross domain
[10:05:31] <PenguinMan98> But I indicate that in the request
[10:05:45] <duch_kazatel> PenguinMan98 does the server allow cross-domain?
[10:06:02] <PenguinMan98> It's freaking 'Indeed'
[10:06:08] <PenguinMan98> I should say so.
[10:07:05] <NoiseEee> maybe pastebin your request?
[10:07:16] <PenguinMan98> sure
[10:07:57] <PenguinMan98> http://pastebin.com/90FzYniT
[10:08:13] <NoiseEee> PenguinMan98: not the url, the script
[10:08:26] <PenguinMan98> ah
[10:10:57] <nhulea> bberry: heres this I couldnt remember what it was called http://matthewmueller.github.io/cheerio/
[10:11:15] <nhulea> you said you were using node and jquery
[10:11:17] <PenguinMan98> http://pastebin.com/GUJvqNxB
[10:14:57] <Katharsis> I can I be sure that my .js is loaded and executed before loading another script?
[10:15:19] <Katharsis> my first script is using for creating form, second for getting values from it
[10:16:05] <NoiseEee> PenguinMan98: uh, and indeed.com is set up to support CORS?!?
[10:16:16] <Katharsis> sometimes (when I refresh page) the final value isn't right because not all inputs are visibile (added)
[10:16:17] <NoiseEee> PenguinMan98: because thats not what i see
[10:16:26] <PenguinMan98> what the heck is CORS?
[10:16:38] <PenguinMan98> I feel like I missed that day at school or something
[10:16:57] <NoiseEee> PenguinMan98: the server you are attempting to connect to needs to support CORS if you are trying to break same origin policy
[10:17:20] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS @ PenguinMan98
[10:18:02] <PenguinMan98> Since Indeed is one of the worlds foremost and ridiculously common API's for searching for jobs, If they didn't support something like this, they'd be super stupid
[10:18:19] <NoiseEee> PenguinMan98: the typical way around this is that your javascript makes an XHR request to your server backend, you use the backend to get the info, and parse/send it back to your app/script
[10:18:20] <duch_kazatel> PenguinMan98 they might support JSONP instaed.
[10:19:06] <PenguinMan98> it was jsonp
[10:19:09] <PenguinMan98> that fixed it
[10:22:21] <PenguinMan98> Even though I was manually adding that '&callback='
[10:22:33] <TheWhisper> Anyone know of a plugin that will vertically distribute elements so there is evening spacing on top and bottom?
[10:23:13] <PenguinMan98> whatevery
[10:23:17] <PenguinMan98> it works. Thanks guys!
[10:26:42] <TheWhisper> Here is a visual example of what I want: http://i.imgur.com/VojUGSw.gif
[10:26:47] <TheWhisper> Anyone know of a plugin that does that?
[10:30:19] <duch_meeting> offtopic - anybody know how long facebook caches images used in "shares"?
[10:30:59] <BillCriswell> duch_meeting: Noooooooo idea. That drove me nuts a while ago, though.
[10:31:10] <duch_meeting> we actually WANT them to cache in this case :)
[10:31:22] <duch_meeting> i know how to bust, but i'm wondering about the other side of that problem.
[10:31:46] <BillCriswell> duch_meeting: I am really not sure. You don't want them requesting the images again and again?
[10:32:10] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: You just want a div with a margin in a collection to dictate the margin for all the other divs?
[10:32:13] <duch_meeting> nope.  we have pages where there are multiple products, but you can share just one - think "finishes of a faucet".
[10:32:31] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of excitement.
[10:32:43] <duch_meeting> we want to be able to share the plack finish version without facebook updating their cache tomorrow of the image/product data.
[10:33:32] <BillCriswell> duch_meeting: Hmmmm... I am really not sure. =(
[10:34:06] <BillCriswell> duch_meeting: So they grab a copy of the image then reupdate it for all posts when a new image is saved?
[10:34:19] <BillCriswell> Like... they basically have an image for each url in their database kind of?
[10:35:17] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, maybe/
[10:35:18] <TheWhisper> ?
[10:35:22] <TheWhisper> Not sure what you mean
[10:35:28] <Mr_Grim> man im almost done
[10:35:36] <Mr_Grim> soo close now haha
[10:36:15] <duch_meeting> BillCriswell sorta.  i'll explain later.
[10:37:04] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:42:31] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Do you need the whole selecting of the box logic as well?
[10:42:45] <TheWhisper> Nope
[10:50:06] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Are these elements over lapping?
[10:50:13] <TheWhisper> no
[10:50:31] <TheWhisper> I feel like I should be able to do this with just CSS
[10:51:57] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: I have no idea what you're asking.
[10:51:57] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Do you just want margin-bottom: 20px ?
[10:52:14] <TheWhisper> No
[10:52:30] <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/VojUGSw.gif
[10:52:39] <BillCriswell> I see this.
[10:52:59] <BillCriswell> It doesn't clearly explain what you want to me.
[10:54:33] <TheWhisper> okay
[10:54:37] <TheWhisper> uh
[10:55:01] <TheWhisper> I want to be able to have the elements 1) change height and 2) vertically distribute with equal space between each
[10:55:09] <TheWhisper> depending on the height of their parent div or something
[10:55:41] <BillCriswell> That gif being on a white background was throwing me off.
[10:55:48] <TheWhisper> lol
[10:56:11] <BillCriswell> It looked like it was just taking them and putting them at the top and putting margin at the bottom.
[10:56:16] <TheWhisper> ah
[10:56:30] <PenguinMan98> Oh I'm sure you could write a javascript to pull off something like that.  Do you know the heights of the items beforehand? Or do you need to query those on the fly?
[10:57:05] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: I'm sure with flexbox it could be pretty simple. Is that cool? Otherwise I think you need JS.
[10:58:12] <BillCriswell> Unless you know how many boxes you have, of course.
[10:58:33] <TheWhisper> I mean, I do know how many boxes I have, though I was hoping for a solution in which that wouldn't matter
[10:58:36] <TheWhisper> but 9
[10:59:51] <TheWhisper> hm
[10:59:55] <TheWhisper> http://jsfiddle.net/X2URZ/162/ is sort of what I want
[11:00:15] <TheWhisper> but not completely
[11:02:01] <frank_o> What's it called when you move your mouse and the content of a div moves with it? Although when making big mouse movements, the div should only move slightly.
[11:02:29] <decx> wat
[11:02:39] <decx> parallax?
[11:02:43] <StephenS> woot
[11:03:13] <frank_o> decx: yes !!
[11:03:17] <frank_o> thank you :)
[11:03:29] <gnu_d> Hi, if jquery mobile has data-page attribute, how to replicate that for Desktop web pages?
[11:03:38] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: http://jsbin.com/himenoci/1/edit?html,css,output This could work, but just do the math for 9.
[11:03:57] <TheWhisper> Yeah
[11:04:09] <frank_o> gnu_d: desktop pages cant use jqm too?
[11:05:01] <gnu_d> frank_o: that was my question, whether one uses jquery mobile for both platforms
[11:05:23] <TheWhisper> oh, BillCriswell, how would this work though if the overall container was set to pos: fixed?
[11:05:30] <frank_o> gnu_d: ofcourse !!
[11:05:40] <gnu_d> frank_o: sweet
[11:05:50] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: It woul still be ok since it still has height.
[11:07:24] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: http://the-echoplex.net/flexyboxes/?fixed-height=on&legacy=on&display=flex&flex-direction=column&flex-wrap=nowrap&justify-content=flex-start&align-items=flex-start&align-content=flex-start&order%5B%5D=0&flex-grow%5B%5D=1&flex-shrink%5B%5D=1&flex-basis%5B%5D=auto&align-self%5B%5D=auto&order%5B%5D=0&flex-grow%5B%5D=1&flex-shrink%5B%5D=1&flex-basis%5B%5D=auto&align-self%5B%5D=auto&order%5B%5D=0&flex-grow%5B%5D=1&flex-

[11:07:27] <BillCriswell> Dammit.
[11:07:30] <TheWhisper> lol
[11:09:11] <decx> jesus
[11:09:35] <frank_o> decx: https://github.com/wagerfield/parallax wow
[11:09:59] <BillCriswell> decx: DON'T EVEN
[11:11:19] <decx> i've been trying to work out parallax style in a ui for years, it's cool but it's going to alienate too many people who get sick from the movement
[11:11:51] <BillCriswell> I think it works well when it's very minimal, but most just take it too far..
[11:12:13] <decx> it just doesnt have a meaningful function
[11:12:26] <BillCriswell> Agreed.
[11:12:31] <BillCriswell> The first site I recall doing it doesn't use it anymore.
[11:12:43] <decx> maybe when occulus takes over the world
[11:12:45] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, gonna send a shortened link?>
[11:12:47] <TheWhisper> *?
[11:12:58] <MikeD_> if I set a custom event ('checkComplete')  and I subscribe to that event at three levels (parent,child,grandchild) - can the middle level (child) subscribe to the same event, catch triggers in grandchildren and stop them before they get to the parent?
[11:13:18] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: http://bit.ly/1nQHPds see if that works lol
[11:13:50] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: You can return false maybe or stopImmediatePropagation.
[11:14:00] <TheWhisper> yup
[11:14:01] <TheWhisper> thanks
[11:14:05] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Sweet.
[11:14:13] <frank_o> decx: yeah i can see that happening
[11:14:19] <BillCriswell> I just can't get used to flex box... but I said the same thing about floats years ago.
[11:14:27] <frank_o> BillCriswell: same
[11:14:30] <TheWhisper> I meant the link works, not the solution offered :P
[11:14:34] <TheWhisper> Let's see
[11:14:37] <BillCriswell> HAha oh.
[11:14:44] <decx> flexbox still eludes me as well
[11:15:28] <BillCriswell> It seems very easy, but trying to use it Im just like "Uhhhhh fuck"
[11:15:36] <decx> i liked the idea of inline-block as a float replacement but the whitespace being included is somewhat retarded
[11:15:49] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, and the hacks around it don't feel natural.
[11:16:18] <decx> there's something else than funky line breaks?
[11:16:30] <decx> break </div><div>
[11:16:48] <BillCriswell> margin-right: -Npx; could also work.
[11:16:56] <BillCriswell> Think the actual number depends on font-size.
[11:16:59] <BillCriswell> Which makes it not very fun.
[11:17:04] <decx> yeah that's a pain
[11:17:17] <BillCriswell> Could maybe get around it with ems. Still doesn't feel right.
[11:17:20] <MikeD_> can you set a 0px font-size on the parent?
[11:17:33] <decx> ah right
[11:17:35] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Yeah, but then you need to set the font size back on all the children.
[11:17:43] <MikeD_> yeah
[11:17:50] <decx> ye that's why i didnt do that
[11:18:01] <frank_o> I'm trying to make this cool cat banner where the cats move in parallax -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/4HpUU/16/ -- shouldn't `$('.wrapper').parallax();` and `data-depth` be enough?
[11:18:02] <decx> also font-size 0 isnt supported everywhere
[11:18:51] <decx> i never used that parallax lib, it's too much fun to hack around that stuff yourself from scratch ^^
[11:18:53] <MikeD_> parent {font-size:0} parent > child { font-size: notZero; }  doesn't do it?
[11:19:10] <frank_o> decx: lol yeah right
[11:19:12] <decx> yeah but then you have to know the elements in your parent or use *
[11:19:21] <BillCriswell> Totally does, still nasty to me.
[11:20:18] <MikeD_> can you select the empty text nodes and delete them?
[11:21:08] <decx> you can do all that crap, or just float and overflow hidden the parent or use .clearfix
[11:21:10] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Then you need JS, which will end up feeling clunky I imagine
[11:21:33] <MikeD_> oh, i assumed #jquery wasn't concerned about the JS requirement :)
[11:21:47] <BillCriswell> I starting thinking of floats as elements floating up and to the left or right instead of just to the left and right and that helped me get through that dark time. I need a similiar thing with flex box to happen haha.
[11:22:02] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: I don't use JS unless I absolutely have to, or it's a fun new framework haha.
[11:22:31] <MikeD_> yeah that was me until this new job - now everything is done clientside / single page apps
[11:23:05] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Yeah, the times they are a changing haha.
[11:23:36] <BillCriswell> I remember getting yelled at in #web years ago for doing things that wouldn't work with javascript. I think it formed a lot of good habits but it's slightly less important now.
[11:24:11] <MikeD_> separation of concerns is one of those good habits
[11:24:20] <BillCriswell> work without javascript*
[11:24:27] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Definitely.
[11:25:11] <BillCriswell> I stil try to do it, even though when someone says like "99.5% of the visitors have JS enabled" I really have no comeback.
[11:25:31] <TheWhisper> Can't get it working, BillCriswell :(
[11:25:39] <MikeD_> fight fire with fire:  SEO bots don't run your javascript
[11:25:42] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: The flexbox way?
[11:25:47] <TheWhisper> yup
[11:25:53] <TheWhisper> I'm gonna take a break
[11:26:10] <MikeD_> though in reality those bots are probably about 15-20% of your traffic
[11:26:12] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: I am not sure that's true anymore recently. I think a page entirely done in JS might cause problems, but little things I think are ok?
[11:26:17] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Yeah true.
[11:26:33] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Probably a good idea. That flex stuff doesn't really click with me yet either.
[11:27:05] <decx> new scrapers run js
[11:27:29] <decx> just not economical to have indians comb through stuff that didn't scrape right
[11:50:44] <gnu_d> how do I add logo in the header ?
[11:54:20] <BillCriswell> image tag?
[12:02:13] <gnu_d> BillCriswell: I forgot where I'm :D
[12:02:21] <BillCriswell> Haha ok.
[12:02:35] <drej> use an <h1> with image replacement instead of <img>
[12:02:36] <drej> thats my 2c
[12:02:50] <gnu_d> BillCriswell: I wanted to ask for jquery mobile
[12:08:37] <Hypnotizes> what is the reverse function of modulus?
[12:08:47] <MikeD_> anyone know an example of custom events that aren't related to browser-native events?  seems all the examples I've googled are on 'click'
[12:10:20] <BillCriswell> Hypnotizes: Not sure what you're asking for there?
[12:10:25] <BillCriswell> Oh, he left.
[12:10:35] <duch_meeting> MikeD_ not sure what you mean.
[12:10:43] <duch_meeting> like, triggering and listening for them?
[12:10:46] <decx> you set up a function and then you trigger it
[12:11:45] <duch_meeting> because you can listen to anything in on - $('#butt').on('fart', function() {console.log('tooot') }); $('#butt').trigger('fart');
[12:12:27] <MikeD_> to extend the analogy (lol) i want to make sure 'fart' propogates all the way up the spine...
[12:13:09] <MikeD_> i guess i need to make a fiddle
[12:13:55] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: It would bubble all the way up as far as I know.
[12:13:57] <MikeD_> my real environment involves trying to maintain state of parents when changes happen in the children without making specific calls to the parent
[12:14:11] <duch_meeting> yep, bubbling works as per usual.
[12:14:31] <MikeD_> also i think i've got a problem with 'this' references in the function too
[12:14:43] <duch_meeting> $(this) will be the element that triggered the event.
[12:15:11] <MikeD_> k, i'll work on it
[12:16:10] <duch_meeting> though your statement about maintining state makes me worried...
[12:25:28] <vacho> damn ios ... does not let me focus on an inputfield with jQuery
[12:26:29] <d0de> I'm using the slider from jQuery-mobile in my phonegap app and it's just... slow
[12:26:33] <d0de> incredibly slow
[12:26:45] <d0de> and I don't know how work out the cause or fix it
[12:27:02] <d0de> even when I unbind everything from it, it's extremely unresponsive on real hardware
[12:30:38] <d0de> can anyone suggest a way to work out what the problem is? An equivalent slider in a browser on the same hardware works fine. All the other css stuff seems to have acceptable performance in-app
[12:39:28] <drakythe> I feel like I’m being really stupid here, but, console.log(“Hello, world!”); should totally log “Hello World” in my firebug console, yes?
[12:39:52] <duch_kazatel> you've got some invalid quotes there.
[12:39:54] <duch_kazatel> but otherwise, yes,.
[12:40:39] <drakythe> duch_kazatel: Invalid quotes?
[12:40:46] <duch_kazatel> those are smart quotes.
[12:40:47] <duch_kazatel> console.log("Hello, world!");
[12:40:56] <BillCriswell> drakythe: It's like you copy and pasted from MS Word.
[12:41:00] <duch_kazatel> you want plain-old quotes, not the ones that are angled.
[12:41:18] <drakythe> Oh! sorry, I’m using colloquy on mac for my IRC client, it converts some characters automatically :P
[12:41:26] <duch_kazatel> ew.
[12:41:51] <duch_kazatel> either way, if you're not getting invalid chars, make sure you've got "all" ticked, instead of one of the other options.
[12:42:52] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/yYqejrM.png
[12:43:02] <drakythe> oh, found the problem, Firefox29 is borked on anything but the first load of jquery apparently? not cool
[12:43:22] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:43:26] <duch_kazatel> that... doesn't make sense
[12:43:33] <duch_kazatel> i'm using 29 right now.
[12:45:51] <drakythe> duch_kazatel: I can’t get a simple ‘Hello, World!’ script to work on jsfiddle in firefox. Exact same script in Chrome runs without a problem
[12:46:03] <drakythe> This makes me unhappy
[12:46:23] <BillCriswell> drakythe: Did you try unplugging it, then plugging it back in again?
[12:46:26] <duch_kazatel> then you've got other problems, because i'm in 29 right now and have had no issues at all.
[12:46:55] <drakythe> BillCriswell: lol, Maybe I ought to restart the poor thing, I’ve been in the Mac eco-system too long, my first response is no longer to restart
[12:47:17] <duch_kazatel> or restart firefox.
[12:47:29] <BillCriswell> drakythe: Same. My uptime is currently 9 days, which isn't very long for me at all.
[12:48:00] <drakythe> duch_kazatel: yeah, just tried it in FF on windows, worked fine…
[12:48:14] * drakythe kills FF on his mac
[12:48:36] <BillCriswell> drakythe: Also, any stupid extensions running?
[12:49:01] <drakythe> BillCriswell: Thats my next step, start FF in safe mode if a restart doesn’t work
[12:52:54] <MikeD_> $( foo ).on( 'myevent', function( evt ){ /* what property of evt references foo?  delegateTarget? */ })
[12:53:59] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Yes.
[12:54:02] <decx> foo is this
[12:55:06] <duch_kazatel> $(this)
[12:55:14] <duch_kazatel> unless you're tlaking about children
[12:55:58] <BillCriswell> I don't know why I imagined a selector parameter before the handler.
[12:56:02] <MikeD_> if that function is not anonymous... i'm not clear where "this" references
[12:56:18] <MikeD_> BillCriswell:  because you usually use delegation :)
[12:56:20] <duch_kazatel> foo, in that case.
[12:56:48] <duch_kazatel> err, maybe.  let me look.
[12:59:02] <duch_kazatel> currentTarget
[12:59:10] <duch_kazatel> even if it's a child element, iirc.
[12:59:11] <MikeD_> if I'm declaring that .on() behavior inside a method of an object... and the function I want to call is a different method of the object...  how do I keep the event.delegateTarget and the object reference?    .on('event', function(evt){ myobj.method.apply( myobj, evt ) } )    ?
[12:59:23] <decx> it's the same if you don't add a child selector to on
[12:59:45] <decx> delegateTarget will be parent in $(parent).on('even',child,fn)
[13:00:32] <MikeD_> right, that's what I was expecting.
[13:12:43] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/2r7GC/
[13:16:18] <decx> huh
[13:16:30] <decx> you trigger check on the button and have your check rule for the li
[13:17:44] <decx> huh i guess it doesnt matter?
[13:17:51] <MikeD_> yes, this example doesn't illustrate that each LI is a component with no awareness of neighbors and implementing its own rules for what makes it "ok"
[13:19:37] <decx> somehow that seems incredibly inconvenient :>
[13:25:17] <jdbcisco> Any idea why when I attempt to run this same code on my Wordpress site the anchor tags open up into a new window rather than running the click function??? http://jsfiddle.net/keriboyer/36seY/
[13:27:23] <BillCriswell> jdbcisco: The target attribute is for targeting windows.
[13:28:09] <BillCriswell> You should probably do data-target="n" and don't forget to prevent the default event.
[13:28:41] <Xgear> Ok so, I still can't seem to figure out why my site works perfectly fine on windows and not on *nix.
[13:28:56] <BillCriswell> jdbcisco: http://jsfiddle.net/36seY/1/ This should work.. I think.
[13:29:01] <Xgear> All files are properly loaded, jquery is working (tested) but it seems to work half of it.
[13:29:15] <Xgear> Thought it'd be a race condition, but doesnt appear to be the case, since some functionality works and some doesnt
[13:30:37] <BillCriswell> Xgear: That still sounds like the symptoms of race conditions... but I have no idea without looking at the code.
[13:30:47] <Xgear> http://prueba.decoriel.cl/producto/roller/roller-sunscreen/sunscreen-5-plateado
[13:31:10] <Xgear> There is a sample, tabs work fine, modal window works fine. But when I click on "Agregar producto" it should do an ajax call, which it doesnt
[13:31:21] <Xgear> (and does on my windows test enviroment)
[13:31:54] <jdbcisco> BillCriswell: Thank you, that prevented it from opening a new tab in my browser window; however, it's not showing the hidden divs on click.
[13:32:52] <BillCriswell> jdbcisco: I'm seeing them.
[13:33:43] <jdbcisco> On the fiddle, yeah it works. It works on mine too; however, as soon as I stick it on my WP server, it doesn't work.
[13:34:30] <BillCriswell> jdbcisco: Did you include jQuery?
[13:35:12] <jdbcisco> It's a Wordpress site so I had to add in my header.php <?php wp_enqueue_script("jquery"); ?>
[13:35:38] <jdbcisco> I validated jQuery to be running going into my browser console and typing "jQuery"
[13:35:45] <jdbcisco> It's running 1.10.2
[13:36:25] <BillCriswell> jdbcisco: Do you have some other event that might be stopping these events from firing? Try putting a console.log() in the click event and see if it triggers.
[13:49:32] <PheLe> Hi all
[13:50:21] <PheLe> Does anyone recommend a good slider that allows me to set interval for each slide?
[13:53:12] <spacebarbarian> like a image slider ?
[13:53:46] <spacebarbarian> PheLe, image slider ?
[13:53:53] <PheLe> Yessir
[13:54:00] <spacebarbarian> PheLe, http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/carousel
[13:56:03] <PheLe> Thanks, 	spacebarbarian
[14:09:29] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[14:14:04] <Bloomberg> How can I to do a loop from object passed through php with jsonin jquery?
[14:14:09] <duch_kazatel> wutp
[14:14:11] <duch_kazatel> *wut
[14:14:15] <nhulea> yo
[14:14:20] <duch_kazatel> doesn't matter where the data came from, yo.
[14:14:47] <duch_kazatel> you just need to output something like var myThing = {someData: 'a value!'} and then enumerate through that sucker.
[14:16:23] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/2Z95U/
[14:16:34] <Bloomberg> for example that
[14:16:45] <Bloomberg> But the var in php is an array
[14:17:00] <Bloomberg> so for to do a loop inside jquery with php var passed with json
[14:17:57] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg the php side doesn't matter - what does the rendered data look like?
[14:19:06] <Bloomberg> for example a ul list with jquery
[14:20:08] <duch_kazatel> you want to enumerate through the lis in a <ul>?
[14:20:46] <duch_kazatel> look into each()
[14:20:55] <duch_kazatel> but a more complete fiddle would be awesome.
[14:23:08] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel : with each() can I do it?
[14:24:13] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg i don't know what you're trying to do.  please copy the stuff you want to enumerate over into the fiddle.
[14:25:21] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel : I'm doing a files manager with two sections, the first for folders and the other for files
[14:25:35] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg i mean the data.
[14:25:40] <Bloomberg> Yes
[14:25:48] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg i can't help unless I can see the json/html/whatever.
[14:26:37] <Bloomberg> phph or jquery?
[14:26:41] <Bloomberg> php*
[14:26:52] <duch_kazatel> the rendered frontend code
[14:27:06] <duch_kazatel> php outputs html - give me that.
[14:27:09] <duch_kazatel> the output/.
[14:27:26] <Bloomberg> Ok
[14:29:40] <Bloomberg> http://pastebin.com/Gx7ALe1U
[14:29:43] <Bloomberg> There is my script
[14:29:53] <Bloomberg> The idea is to see all the files like ul list
[14:30:04] <Bloomberg> All works ok.
[14:30:17] <Bloomberg> The only problem is just bring one record from json var
[14:30:27] <Bloomberg> but really there are more rows
[14:31:08] <duch_kazatel> dude... the rendered code.
[14:31:14] <duch_kazatel> the html/javascript.  not the php.
[14:32:06] <Bloomberg> http://www.gleamtech.com/demos/filevista/
[14:32:07] <Bloomberg> see that plz
[14:32:12] <Bloomberg> Is the same of that
[14:32:26] <duch_kazatel> that isn't helping.
[14:32:28] <Bloomberg> But only the files in the main wrapper
[14:32:39] <Bloomberg> the mine is such as that
[14:32:55] <duch_kazatel> when you can update that fiddle with the appropriate html, let me know ;)
[14:33:31] <Bloomberg> wanna you see it online?
[14:33:47] <duch_kazatel> no.  i want to see the html that your php outputs without going to your site or anything.
[14:33:52] <duch_kazatel> i want you to put that html into the fiddle.
[14:34:15] <Bloomberg> http://pastebin.com/index/Gx7ALe1U
[14:34:17] <Bloomberg> such as?
[14:34:39] <duch_kazatel> so that php will generate HTML that gets sent to the browser.  copy the code using your dev tools in the browser.
[14:35:40] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel : I can't understand what are you request to me!
[14:36:24] <duch_kazatel> the browser does not get sent PHP.  the browser gets html, javascript, and css.
[14:36:32] <duch_kazatel> send me the part the browser gets.
[14:36:46] <Bloomberg> Ok
[14:41:46] <Bloomberg> For example I'm getting this  :::  {"file":"Diego","route":"Fernando"}
[14:41:52] <Bloomberg> But just show me Diego
[14:42:09] <duch_kazatel> what variable is that stored in?
[14:43:38] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel : files
[14:43:54] <duch_kazatel> so it's var files =  {"file":"Diego","route":"Fernando"}; ?
[14:44:08] <duch_kazatel> because if that's the case, the javascript would do files.file
[14:44:15] <Bloomberg> !yes
[14:44:15] <b-ot> Bloomberg: http://i.imgur.com/DQty40Z.jpg
[14:44:19] <duch_kazatel> or files['file'];
[14:44:22] <Bloomberg> but only show me one record
[14:44:29] <duch_kazatel> "only show me one record" huh?
[14:44:51] <Bloomberg> one data of the result}
[14:45:16] <duch_kazatel> if you're using an object, there will only ever be one property named "file"
[14:45:30] <Bloomberg> mm..
[14:45:33] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/b6ps9/
[14:45:41] <Bloomberg> I don't know what to do
[14:45:44] <duch_kazatel> you cannot have multiple "file" properties of "file"
[14:46:03] <duch_kazatel> might adding a more complete copy of the data into that fiddle?
[14:46:15] <Bloomberg> ok
[14:46:21] <Bloomberg> I will try
[14:47:20] <andrew9183> what are you trying to do ?
[14:47:44] <duch_kazatel> he can't really explain.  he was asking about iterating through php opbjects, then something about the lis in a ul.
[14:47:49] <duch_kazatel> then sent over an object.
[14:48:21] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg do you want to see "diego" and then "fernando"
[14:49:30] <Bloomberg> I believe simply my question is how can I iterate an array of objects inside jquery
[14:49:52] <duch_kazatel> by using .each(), but if you're just using an object, there's no need to use that.
[14:51:15] <Bloomberg> I'm going to test the each and then I caome here
[14:51:30] <Bloomberg> anyway many thanks for you
[14:51:45] <duch_kazatel> i'm cooking up examples.
[14:51:46] <duch_kazatel> 1 se.c
[14:52:09] <Bloomberg> for me?
[14:52:11] <duch_kazatel> yes
[14:52:24] <Bloomberg> ok
[14:52:24] <Bloomberg> thank you man
[14:52:30] <andrew9183> just do arrayOfObjects.forEach(function() {} );
[14:52:42] <duch_kazatel> it's not an array though :/
[14:52:46] <duch_kazatel> use a normal for loop.
[14:53:13] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/b6ps9/3/
[14:53:28] <duch_kazatel> the first of those two will generally be faster than the second.
[14:54:41] <andrew9183> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.each
[14:54:47] <andrew9183> it's pretty much the same thing
[14:54:57] <duch_kazatel> there's still a minor overhead, but meh.
[14:55:12] <duch_kazatel> i personally prefer to not use .each() if i'm just dealing with plain ol' objects.
[14:55:12] <andrew9183> sorry just being an ass
[14:55:12] <andrew9183> its friday
[14:55:12] <andrew9183> :)
[14:55:18] <duch_kazatel> i know ;)
[14:55:24] <andrew9183> i prefer not to use jquery at all
[14:55:27] <andrew9183> ironic, i know
[14:55:31] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:55:40] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel : thank you so much
[14:55:44] <Bloomberg> I will test them
[14:55:46] <duch_kazatel> i think it's a great tool, but dumping into it for every little thing is really strange.
[14:55:52] <andrew9183> i used to write some jquery spaghetti back in the day
[14:55:56] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg it'd still be great to really know wtf you're doing, but meh.
[14:56:38] <duch_kazatel> andrew9183 i've gotten better about not doing that.  i've been on a highly modularised code kick.  also playing around with FRP.
[14:56:46] <andrew9183> FPR?
[14:56:49] <andrew9183> FRP?
[14:56:54] <duch_kazatel> functional reactive programming
[14:57:09] <andrew9183> so like binding to events and reacting to them ?
[14:57:13] <andrew9183> i dunno the lingo
[14:58:02] <duch_kazatel> more like linking values to one another.
[14:58:02] <duch_kazatel> http://engineering.silk.co/post/80056130804/reactive-programming-in-javascript
[14:58:19] <duch_kazatel> so you update a value, and that might fire off a function somewhere else.
[15:07:14] <nhulea> hey what is better wya to write this http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/jvVSP/
[15:08:03] <duch_kazatel> woah.  what are you trying to do here?
[15:08:30] <nhulea> check for certain hours I gues
[15:08:37] <nhulea> haha
[15:08:42] <duch_kazatel> using what criteria?  some context might be nice.
[15:09:30] <nhulea> I have 3 select lists of which contain hrs I am trying to check against the output of that '
[15:10:04] <nhulea> it works I just thought there might be a better to check
[15:10:11] <duch_kazatel> so you have hour1, hour2, and hour3?
[15:10:19] <nhulea> yeah
[15:10:26] <duch_kazatel> and yeah there are tons of better ways to check depending on what you're trying to accomplish.
[15:10:52] <nhulea> I just need to know if the output is equal to 11 12 or 1
[15:11:01] <duch_kazatel> the output of any of them?
[15:11:24] <nhulea> yeah
[15:11:26] <duch_kazatel> 1 sec.
[15:14:19] <nhulea> hey duch_kazatel I actually gotta take off can you email me it ?
[15:14:22] <nhulea> haha
[15:14:36] <duch_kazatel> basically, it'd kinda be like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jvVSP/1/
[15:14:42] <duch_kazatel> add 'em all to an array, then check the array.
[15:14:56] <duch_kazatel> something like that.,
[15:15:08] <duch_kazatel> err, an object.
[15:15:32] <duch_kazatel> or hell, use .each() and just check the .val() directly and return out when you find the match.
[15:15:46] <nhulea> oh ok yeah then check the id and val and this is all of them
[15:15:59] <nhulea> each interates theough this
[15:16:37] <duch_kazatel> ed #jquery
[15:16:37] <duch_kazatel> [2014:05:02:15:15:38] * ninsei (~Android@75.115.23.109) Quit (Ex
[15:16:40] <nhulea> current hours contains all the parameters of the object and check against the 3 objects that are created
[15:16:42] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/jvVSP/2/ - this.
[15:16:46] <duch_kazatel> even smarter.
[15:17:04] <duch_kazatel> no need for the extra object, just check them directly.
[15:17:30] <nhulea> hell yeah thanks that is really fucking clean !
[15:17:51] <duch_kazatel> i'm sure there are other bits 'n pieces you could do, but that's a start.
[15:18:02] <nhulea> then I can add more slect lists and it will still work
[15:18:35] <nhulea> thanks I ll hit you guys up in a couple of hrs rock n roll !
[15:18:35] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[15:18:41] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[15:33:54] <waspinator_> I'm trying to show a jquery fullcalendar inside of a bootstrap modal without having it popping into view. any ideas on how I could fade it in along with the rest of the modal?
[15:33:55] <waspinator_> http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/HfSLs/1/
[15:34:52] <enricostn> hi there, I'm following this tutorial http://backbonetutorials.com/organizing-backbone-using-modules/ but requireJS keeps trying to load jQuery in the root directory
[15:34:58] <enricostn> any idea?
[15:35:27] <enricostn> GET http://localhost:8000/app/js/core.js 404 not found
[15:35:57] <enricostn> it should look for app/js/libs/jquery/...
[15:38:00] <jonkristian> Has anyone used this and does anyone know if it's possible to force a copy of the dragged element instead of moving it? https://github.com/farhadi/html5sortable
[15:48:19] <duch_kazatel> waspinator_ you'd have to generate the modal first and fade that in.
[15:48:24] <duch_kazatel> not sure how bootstrap would handle that.
[15:57:23] <jonkristian> ugh, it pains me that almost everything i find on drag and drop include jquery ui :/
[15:58:54] <jonkristian> duch_workbeer, cheers!
[16:03:51] <zizzl> Hey guys, I'm using a video service (Wistia) that uses Fancybox for their pop up videos. Works great but for some reason the overlay ".fancybox-overlay" has the background property in the jQuery fancybox css that's loaded, but for some reason it doesn't show, BUT when I inspect the overlay, it magically appears.. I hate to be the lame person that asks without a link, but unfortunately I can't link it nor can I repl
[16:03:51] <zizzl> icate in fiddle, just wanted to see if anyone had ideas
[16:05:58] <waspinator_> duch_kazatel, might have to go into the boostrap js/css file I guess
[16:15:06] <Nephro> Is it possible to set scrolling position by percentage values?
[16:17:42] <erming> Nephro: don't think so. You'll probably have to calculate it yourself
[16:18:30] <erming> scrollHeight and scrollTop()
[16:24:52] <PheLe> Does anyone know how to change the slide speed of each slide with bootstrap carousel?
[16:28:26] <cfoch> hello, I'm trying Autocomplete plugin, but there's something weird... it only works after an "allert() command".
[16:28:48] <erming> cfoch, are you putting your code inside a jQuery-ready function?
[16:28:53] <cfoch> yes
[16:29:30] <enricostn> may anyone point me at a sample app using requireJS and jquery using AMD please?
[16:29:43] <enricostn> it can't be so painful
[16:29:53] <erming> cfoch: i guess you're using that Autocomplete on a plugin.. when and how do you activate autoComplete. and is the <input> inserted by javascript?
[16:30:32] <systemfault> enricostn: I think there’s an example on the todomvc website
[16:30:49] <enricostn> thanks, looking
[16:30:49] <systemfault> enricostn: But ultimately.. require.js kind of suck.
[16:31:01] <enricostn> oh, any suggestion?
[16:31:12] <cfoch> erming... no... the input isn't inserted by javascript
[16:32:25] <systemfault> enricostn: I use browserify on my current project, seems saner to me.
[16:32:33] <erming> cfoch: ok.. these kind of bugs are so hard to track down, so i wish you good luck :)
[16:32:44] <cfoch> ha, okay, thanks
[16:33:29] <enricostn> systemfault, ok I'll give it a try. however the problem here seems to be related to AMD
[16:34:08] <enricostn> I'm only requiring jquery and it cannot find the files...
[16:34:13] <systemfault> enricostn: AMD works fine as long as you (And the libraries you are using) respect its conventions
[16:34:50] <systemfault> enricostn: Is your code properly wrapped?
[16:34:58] <enricostn> systemfault, well I'm starting a project and I've only my (almost empty) main.js that try to require jquery
[16:35:16] <enricostn> I can gist it, it's like 10 lines....
[16:38:30] <waspinator_> duch_kazatel, seems messy but it's working http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/HfSLs/5/
[16:42:07] <enricostn> systemfault, https://gist.github.com/enricostano/75be06b02046a99a82b6
[16:43:00] <systemfault> enricostn: There’s a typo on line 11 but I guess that’s not the problem, right?
[16:43:09] <enricostn> reload pleas XD
[16:44:58] <enricostn> systemfault, I've added the errors in a comment
[16:45:43] <systemfault> enricostn: Are you like… using the non-built version of jQuery?
[16:47:41] <enricostn> mh... I don't know I just added backbone as dependency in bower.json and it installed jquery in that folder
[16:49:11] <systemfault> I must admit that I never used a unbuilt version of jQuery
[16:49:36] <systemfault> Basically, you’re loading jquery.js… and that file tries to load other AMD modules
[16:49:43] <systemfault> and fails to do so.
[16:50:50] <enricostn> mh so I should add jquery as a dependency in bower and point to it?
[16:51:20] <systemfault> I don’t know, using bower gave you the unbuilt version?
[16:51:27] <enricostn> I would expect that bower.json in jquery repo deliver the build one
[16:51:35] <enricostn> how could I check it?
[16:54:40] <enricostn> systemfault, I've added bower.json to the gist https://gist.github.com/enricostano/75be06b02046a99a82b6
[16:54:45] <enricostn> thanks for your time!
[17:00:09] <enricostn> systemfault, .....that was the issue
[17:00:21] <enricostn> I was pointing to /src insted /dist
[17:00:26] <enricostn> many many thanks
[17:00:45] <enricostn> this is my first JS project
[18:58:31] <javed_7134> Hi
[18:58:35] <javed_7134> everybody
[18:58:52] <javed_7134> a small help needed
[19:02:00] <bowenac> having a problem with an if statement http://pastebin.com/rg6riSLX can someone take a look at that
[19:02:52] <bowenac> it always adds display block
[19:06:40] <bowenac> if else same thing
[19:07:55] <bowenac> actually when I use if else if I set the drop down to not one of those states, it hides it like it should, but then if I change it, it doesnt seem to hit the else or do the check again
[19:08:06] <bowenac> but every time I do a click it shows the correct value...
[19:10:39] <javed_7134> can you please have a look http://www.kwlawoffice.ca/
[19:10:48] <javed_7134> hover over about menu
[19:11:02] <javed_7134> you ll see there is green border
[19:11:30] <javed_7134> i want to fill the background in green color
[19:13:04] <Epitaque> hey uh, is this the place to ask newb questions?
[19:15:34] <bowenac> #menu-item-323.current-menu-item, #menu-item-323:hover, .sub-menu {     background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #99B563 !important; }
[19:15:40] <bowenac> use firebug or chrometools
[19:16:00] <bowenac> was my question a newb question?
[19:18:21] <jphase> bowenac: firstly, I'd suggest you put one of those ifs in an else, and secondly, you might want to do something like var state = jQuery.trim(jQuery("#billing_state option:selected").text());
[19:18:28] <jphase> perhaps it's got some spaces in there somewhere
[19:18:54] <bowenac> jphase I changed it back to an if else
[19:18:55] <shoky> not to mention he's using || all wrong
[19:18:57] <bowenac> same thing though
[19:19:00] <bowenac> I will try the trim
[19:19:01] <jphase> Epitaque: there's no such thing as a noob question
[19:19:12] * jphase awaits foot in mouth
[19:19:24] <jphase> oh yeah!
[19:19:28] <jphase> bowenac: listen to shoky
[19:19:31] <jphase> didn't even see that
[19:19:42] <Epitaque> haha, anyway, i'm going to learn more about the basics of javascript before asking questions here
[19:19:43] <bowenac> is || not for or
[19:19:53] <jphase> bowenac: if(state != 'Ohio' || state != 'West Virginia' ||  etc.
[19:19:55] <shoky> if (condition1 || condition2 || condition3 ...)
[19:19:57] <jphase> you need state in there each time
[19:20:01] <bowenac> lol
[19:20:04] <bowenac> haha ok
[19:20:44] <jphase> Epitaque: no one is going to make fun of you, but no one will argue if you want to go read first either heh
[19:21:17] <bowenac> same
[19:21:42] <jphase> bowenac: make a fiddle
[19:22:37] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/LeBRD/
[19:24:10] <shoky> bowenac: || is OR, remember.
[19:24:16] <bowenac> Ground (UPS): should only show up if the selected option is one of those states
[19:24:21] <shoky> go through the logic of your if statement
[19:25:20] <eip56> Howdy shoky been awhile how you been
[19:25:40] <shoky> hy eip56 i've been dandy. yourself?
[19:26:11] <eip56> Good. Same old thing dev coffee getting lost in the interwebs you know how it goes
[19:26:17] <bowenac> needed &&
[19:26:20] <shoky> hehe ;p
[19:26:27] <bowenac> thanks for pointing me in the right direction
[19:26:39] <bowenac> I was reading it wrong or thinking wrong when I wrote it I guess
[19:26:56] <bowenac> I was thinking AND would be that it doesnt equal all of those values lol
[19:27:00] <jphase> bowenac: just do something like this or whatever http://jsfiddle.net/LeBRD/1/
[19:27:22] <jphase> now why those selectors aren't working I don't know, but I'm lazy :\
[19:27:36] <bowenac> lol I got it jphase thanks though
[19:27:39] <bowenac> is one better than the other?
[19:27:58] <jphase> meh, not necessarily, I just do switches in those cases in case you need to do other special stuff based on the value later
[19:28:10] <jphase> I don't like HUGE lines of if || yadda yadda
[19:28:40] <shoky> i'd put the names in an array and use .indexOf
[19:30:09] <jphase> was just rewriting that way hah
[19:32:09] <jphase> or even .inArray :0  I never use that one
[19:33:09] <Nomius> Hello
[19:33:42] * jphase waves
[19:34:16] <Nomius> I'm trying to use DataTables
[19:34:50] <Nomius> Is it there a way to apply a server side script to a group of selected rows? I mean, not on every row, something like "Ok -> Now apply it"
[19:35:34] <jphase> Nomius: I'm sure you could write some ajax function sure
[19:36:31] <jphase> it's like any other table really, just add a column that has some sort of toggle in it (like a checkbox) and have a button or something you can add a .post to
[19:38:19] <Taggnostr2> Nomius, you can probably use columnDefs and createdCell
[19:38:48] <Taggnostr2> or something similar for rows
[19:40:12] <Epitaque> if I wanted to include a script in my html file, I would just do <script src="main.js"> right?
[19:40:24] <Taggnostr2> Nomius, or if you want the user to filter/select the rows first and then apply the script, it shouldn't be difficult to add a button that checks the selected rows and their content
[19:40:58] <Taggnostr2> Epitaque, also type="text/javascript", and </script> at the end
[19:41:18] <Epitaque> okay, that makes a lot of sense, thank you
[19:59:43] <sadtaco> Oh my god. I've spent 3 hours trying to figure out why some elements are being hidden after updating from 1.6 to 2.1
[19:59:53] <sadtaco> Is there no way to trace where a click event came from?
[20:06:12] <supsup> sup
[20:12:23] <jphase> sadtaco: in your click event use $(this)
[20:12:41] <sadtaco> I was. IT seems simply using toggle() was making issues
[20:13:29] <sadtaco> I finally figured out replacing them with click() and checking if visible or not in there resolved the issues
[20:19:30] <supsup> anyone around
[20:19:37] <jphase> mhm
[20:33:35] <Synthead> is there documentation on the valid options for numberFormat to .spinner()?  Seen here: http://api.jqueryui.com/spinner/#option-numberFormat
[20:53:26] <Vooloo> I got this: $(document.body).append(navigation_tree(nav_tree)); which should build a HTML ul/li list, but how do I echo it to my HTML?
[20:56:33] <jphase> Vooloo: I assume navigation_tree is a function you wrote. You need to make sure that function returns a jQuery DOM object
[20:56:47] <jphase> if it returns a string of HTML you should wrap it with $()
[20:58:38] <jphase> Vooloo: also, just use $('body').append rather than $(document.body).append
[21:41:36] <jphase> oooOOoo, dope! http://kylestetz.github.io/CLNDR/
[21:45:05] <noober3> anyone familiar with jqgrids? i am trying it out but i can't seem to get the theme to load
[22:29:57] <abishek> can someone advice on what is wrong in http://jsbin.com/kubegoho/1/edit
[22:32:59] <Kamuela> I don't think this is a jquery proper question, but I am getting a weird result wherein mobile safari has the expected response but chrome on windows/ubuntu does not
[22:37:26] <abishek> how to use the not method properly in this case http://jsbin.com/kubegoho/6/edit
[22:39:42] <jphase> abishek: id="#cat1" means your selector would be $('##cat1')
[22:40:07] <abishek> jphase, that is fixed, can you check http://jsbin.com/kubegoho/6/edit
[22:40:47] <jphase> abishek: well what you have it programmed to do is working
[22:40:53] <jphase> what are you wanting to do differently?
[22:41:15] <abishek> it shows everything and then hides the desired ones, how can i prevent this?
[22:41:57] <jphase> whoops, network hiccup
[22:42:30] <jphase> abishek: what are you wanting to do differently in that last example?
[22:43:16] <abishek> according to my code, it should first fadeOut the not category ones and then fadeIn() but it does the reverse of it. it first fadein's and then fadeouts
[22:43:50] <jphase> abishek: well no, it's actually fading them both at the same time
[22:44:03] <jphase> takes time for each to work, they're not deferred events
[22:44:16] <jphase> if you want to fade one out and then the other in, you'll probably want to use animate
[22:44:26] <abishek> ok
[22:45:20] <jphase> can I suggest something different?
[22:49:42] <SlashD0T> hola all. just got some general questions
[22:51:17] <SlashD0T> mostly im working on building a locally hosted web site designed similar to netflix but built to access my local media library
[22:52:11] <jphase> abishek: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/Wg8Lm/
[22:52:35] <jphase> ^ that way it works with any amount of categories from the same code
[22:52:37] <SlashD0T> the main question i have is how "safe" is it to use multiple diff sliders on the same page
[22:53:06] <jphase> SlashD0T: safe like how?
[22:53:23] <SlashD0T> interaction with each other wise
[22:53:42] <SlashD0T> i dont want them to interfere with each other
[22:54:40] <jphase> SlashD0T: if you're using a slider that isn't ghetto it should work just fine. any developer that knows how to write a jQuery plugin should be treating each instance as separate entities
[22:55:08] <SlashD0T> its not really that tho im using 2 diff sliders currently
[22:55:49] <SlashD0T> anoslide for the sidebar menu widgets to flip through a list. and smoothdivscroll to use on the main content as an image thumbnail slider
[22:56:18] <jphase> and is there some sort of problem with either of them?
[22:56:35] <SlashD0T> both are compatible with the same jquery.min versions but im just wondering how "bad" it is coding wise to use 2 diff ones on the same page
[22:57:04] <jphase> I mean, use the same library if you can, but if one accomplishes something the other one doesn't that you require on your page, then use them
[22:57:07] <SlashD0T> right now im having an issue getting the smoothdivscoller to work correctly (im sure its just my implementation tho)
[22:57:15] <jphase> just know that more libraries = more ghetto for sluggish load and all that
[22:57:27] <SlashD0T> indeed which is what im trying to avoid
[22:57:43] <jphase> well you may want to look into a very basic library like cycle2
[22:57:43] <SlashD0T> even tho its all going to stay locally hosted
[22:57:48] <jphase> then implement additional functionality
[22:58:00] <jphase> you can turn cycle into a slider or a carousel, etc.
[22:58:35] <jphase> yeah, not too big of a deal with it being local anyway, but try to use the same libraries for multiple purposes if you can
[22:58:40] <SlashD0T> would that allow me to build say , a single image slider to display one image at a time but auto scroll through them. and also implement a multiple image  slider on the same page?
[22:58:56] <jphase> yeah
[22:59:01] <SlashD0T> :o
[22:59:24] <jphase> it won't look like it from the demo page cause most people use it for a carousel
[22:59:29] <SlashD0T> thats what id ideally like to go with is a single base that allows for multiple diff instances and styles
[22:59:48] <jphase> but all you need to do is only display 1 item at a time and use css to have them be positioned absolutely on top of each other and such
[22:59:55] <jphase> change the transition to fade and voila, slider
[23:00:13] <SlashD0T> nice ty for the pointers
[23:00:13] <jphase> can also do vertical carousels and all that
[23:00:17] <jphase> mhm
[23:00:47] <SlashD0T> never built anything like this from scratch before so still trying to gsther info on the best wya to go about it :D
[23:23:24] <wa5ted> if i have a .next() on an element
[23:23:28] <wa5ted> eelment being an li
[23:23:34] <wa5ted> and the element is the first li in a ul
[23:23:49] <wa5ted> when i do .previous() to selectthe previous child
[23:23:57] <wa5ted> whhat element does .previous() point to
[23:24:07] <jphase> .prev() will point to nothing in that case
[23:24:13] <wa5ted> kk
[23:24:15] <wa5ted> cool
[23:26:24] <wa5ted> jphnice to see you again :)
