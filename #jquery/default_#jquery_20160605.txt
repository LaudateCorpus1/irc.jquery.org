[04:49:59] <joaocastanho> Is it possible to get user exact location with jquery?
[07:07:00] <PlanC> I'm trying to make a basic upload form with a progressbar
[07:07:23] <PlanC> the best way to do it is with a form and a simple <input type="file"> but that doesn't give a progressbar
[07:07:43] <PlanC> it seems like a lot of hassle to use chunks only for a progressbar
[07:08:01] <PlanC> anyone know of an easy way of creating an upload form?
[07:50:20] <ales> is this being made in angular js? https://peerigon.com/
[08:03:59] <shoky_> ales: no, react
[08:05:16] <ales> okay ty shoky_
[08:38:16] <_cb>  page1.html has $(document).on("pageinit","#page1",function()..  and $(document).on("pageinit","#page2",function()... page1 loads page 2 via href and page 2 loads page1 back via href. page1 script does not execute when loading from page 2. WHat am I doing wrong?
[08:39:57] <_cb> Found it. need to use pageshow instead of pageinit
