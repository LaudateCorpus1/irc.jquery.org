[02:23:47] <renka> good morning. :)
[04:31:11] <Jeff_Smart> hi, any one here can help? i have an input field and I want to show the same content on the fly in another field or box
[04:37:28] <Oka> Jeff_Smart: Use an input event, and dump the value. http://jsfiddle.net/76fqzz1t/
[07:31:33] <chowder> JS/Jquery noob here. I have a function which dynamically creates a form and adds it to the page. I want to override the submit of the form in that function as well. How can I do that? If I have the overried outside the function it seams to work, but not inside. Thanks
[07:35:46] <nikhil_> chowder, it's probably because you need to register the event when the document is ready or AFTER the form has been added
[07:36:23] <nikhil_> so if you are adding multiple forms that would mean you want to use $.on("click", function() {....})
[07:36:55] <nikhil_> chowder, alternatively if the form generation code has an after: callback you can probably put the override in there
[07:37:17] <nikhil_> chowder, note that i am also noob and its hard to tell without seeing some code, http://dpaste.de will do
[07:37:34] <chowder> nikhil_: alright, just a sec
[07:39:11] <chowder> nikhil_: here it is: https://dpaste.de/8Q4c
[07:39:32] <chowder> you can see at the bottom, I have the submit function. (it has the ID hardcoded for now)
[07:43:54] <chowder> my general question is: is this correct and if so, then I probably should look at a typo or something or is it going out of scope after the whole fucntion is done
[07:44:10] <nikhil_> chowder, where is start_a_chat called
[07:44:27] <chowder> when you click a certain button
[07:44:53] <nikhil_> chowder, what is this? https://dpaste.de/8Q4c#L49 (l49)
[07:45:05] <nikhil_> chowder, that's referring neither to an id nor a class
[07:45:36] <chowder> nikhil_: typo, though I had it with # and it still wasn't working. Let me check again.
[07:46:17] <nikhil_> chowder, that shouldn't be '1_1_form' -- shouldn't it be '<id1>_<id2>_form'
[07:47:43] <chowder> nikhil_: yeah I hardcoded that. But the embarrasing thing is, it now works.
[07:47:54] <chowder> the strange thing is I had it with # and the IDs
[07:47:59] <chowder> and it still refreshed
[07:48:09] <chowder> Oh well. Thanks anyway!
[08:02:51] <nikhil_> chowder, it's not going to work for the general case methinks
[08:03:59] <nikhil_> chowder, you need a handler like $('#<id_1>_<id_2>_form').on("submit", function() {...})

[09:30:53] <dude999_> here is my fiddle
[09:30:54] <dude999_> http://jsfiddle.net/meily/7j7xofn7/11/
[09:32:09] <dude999_> the thing is now when user make mistake by left the required fields blank and even after they complete the error fields correctly the form won't be submitting,
[09:33:35] <dude999_> and the form only submit when user are making no mistake, and i use this if statement on line 112 to prevent form from submitting when my file upload function detect that files that user choose are not valid
[09:33:51] <dude999_> here is that else code: } else {                     e.preventDefault();                 }

[09:37:31] <dude999_> :)
[10:43:50] <Nialcen> Hello
[10:44:43] <Nialcen> I'm looking for a way to find a number between two strings using jQuery, so I tried to use a regex with .match()
[10:44:58] <Nialcen> but I'm unable to solve it
[10:45:23] <Nialcen> I tried this : https://jsfiddle.net/w5svzf2e/
[10:45:40] <Nialcen> and this : https://jsfiddle.net/7d31kbcu/1/
[10:45:53] <Nialcen> but nothing seems to work
[10:46:25] <Nialcen> and regexp seems fine https://regex101.com/#code_1
[10:47:38] <onr> -1 not enough jquery
[10:48:33] <Nialcen> If you have a simple solution to do the same using jquery I will be glad to use it :)
[11:40:51] <daedeloth> http://paste.ubuntu.com/12100226/
[11:41:04] <daedeloth> that jquery.when does not do what I think it's supposed to do
[11:41:09] <daedeloth> it doesn't wait until the files are loaded
[11:41:11] <daedeloth> any thoughts?
[12:04:20] <KG7KTQ> So I'm very new to JQuery, and don't exactly know what I'm doing. But a friend and I were working on his website last night, and came across an issue where our script only works the second time it's loaded on the page. He made a Reddit thread, and we tried what the commenter said to no avail: http://redd.it/3h6l6n
[12:05:08] <KG7KTQ> Also got downvoted pretty heavily. If someonw could explain where I messed up with the script, that would be excellent.
[12:08:39] <KG7KTQ> Also, I hope I'm using jsbin right: http://jsbin.com/nenuhenuzi/edit?html,output
[13:27:03] <thinkeyP> Hey! I'm having a little trouble with a regular expression. Any ideas why the two lines in the middle won't get matched? https://regex101.com/r/qG5pF0/6 Thanks!
[13:58:07] <skinux> I'm getting xhr is not defined.
[13:58:17] <skinux> I thought it is a built-in of jQuery
[14:00:57] <arc_> KG7KTQ it seems like someone answered your question in the reddit thread ...
[14:03:13] <arc_> oh wow that was a long time ago, channel not very active today
[14:15:58] <skinux> I'm getting "unexpected identifer" for line 51 of application-spreadsheet.js which can be found at https://github.com/skinuxgeek/candilog/blob/master/public/lib/application-spreadsheet.js
[14:25:37] <KG7KTQ> arc_, we tried that but it didn't really work. In fact, using $(window).load or $(document).ready actually makes it not work at all, so rather than loading when switching away and back to the Minecraft page, it won't load period.
[14:26:08] <KG7KTQ> and yeah, channel seems a bit dead
[14:31:17] <skinux> KG7KTQ: Can you please help me figure out which identifier isn't recognized in line 51 https://github.com/skinuxgeek/candilog/blob/master/public/lib/application-spreadsheet.js
[14:33:24] <KG7KTQ> If I had to guess, it would be 'click'.
[14:34:32] <KG7KTQ> I'm not well experienced in JavaScript though, so take my advice with several grains of salt.
[14:41:23] <skinux> Does this have to have the second parameter? beforeSend: function(jqXHR xhr, PlainObject settings ) {
[14:43:48] <KG7KTQ> I'm sorry, I really don't know the answer to that.
[14:44:28] <skinux> Well, it's saying unexpected identifer for that line. I don't understand why, it matches the documentation.
[14:46:25] <skinux> Sheesh...No programming language has given me as much trouble learning as JavaScript.
[14:47:52] <arc_> are you using firebug
[14:47:54] <skinux> No.
[14:48:06] <arc_> i would recommend that if you are debugging javascript
[14:48:07] <skinux> I'm using Chrome Inspector.
[14:50:30] <skinux> I'll open up Firefox and try to use Firebug, but I think Inspector does the same thing.
[14:50:58] <skinux> I know I really should learn the various debugging tools available.
[14:52:18] <arc_> line 51 in github does not match the line you pasted
[14:52:37] <arc_> presumably because of these merge errors
[14:52:50] <arc_> i cannot find the code you pasted anywhere
[14:55:03] <arc_> ok, i see where it is now. it's been modified
[14:55:22] <skinux> Well, Firebug says there is a missing ')' when there isn't.
[14:58:34] <arc_> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/handsontable/CRGAM7BIlcA
[14:58:48] <arc_> read the first post by luke jones
[15:00:29] <`ULT-> hi guys
[15:00:43] <`ULT-> in jsfiddle there is the red dot that give your information about syntax errors
[15:01:03] <`ULT-> but since a while the dot isn`t giving any information anymore.

[17:30:10] <Mark_2> how do i give css animation fadeInUp when click on the button?
[17:30:14] <Mark_2> do i have to use onclick?
[17:30:33] <Mark_2> i want it the css animation to start only when i click on the button, not automaically.
[17:30:37] <Mark_2> *automatically
[17:43:03] <onr> Mark_2: you thought you could escape from me!?
[17:43:20] <Mark_2> lolz.
[17:43:25] <Mark_2> scary.
[17:44:36] <Mark_2> i googled and the only option was to give onclick event which seems complicated and uncessesary.
[18:42:03] <Foxhoundz> what's a better way to do this: http://jsbin.com/qesuhipaje/edit?html,css,js,output
[18:42:28] <Foxhoundz> I'm trying to keep the width of the content div dynamically sized along with the other grid items which are percentage based
[19:00:31] <arc_> so i'm a bit confused here. i thought that events are supposed to propagate up through all of the containing elements until it reaches document
[19:01:20] <arc_> but i guess if there is an event handler on the item that is actually being clicked, it stops propagating?
[19:02:11] <arc_> like if there is an icon in the center of a button that doesn't take up the entire space, and that's where people normally click, but you can also click in the area around the icon, which fires a click event for the containing element
[19:02:46] <arc_> what i ended up doing was making two click events
